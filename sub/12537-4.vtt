01:11.364 --> 01:13.331
Jimmy, I didn't know
about the raid.

01:13.366 --> 01:15.066
It was not a set-up,
I swear to God.

01:15.101 --> 01:17.102
Really? How very fucking
convenient.

01:17.136 --> 01:18.837
Where are my phones?

01:19.305 --> 01:21.306
I ran 'em.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.775
For me, not the cops. None
of this is going anywhere.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.544
You better fucking
have something.

01:25.578 --> 01:27.712
You think we're
standing here for the view?

01:27.747 --> 01:30.415
One of your crew was
receiving empty texts.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.217
Blank, nothing on them.

01:32.251 --> 01:36.087
Soon after he got them the cell site
on his phone showed he came here.

01:36.789 --> 01:39.324
I mean, come on,
look around you.

01:39.358 --> 01:43.295
These are meetings neither party wanted
anyone to know about, especially you.

01:43.329 --> 01:45.030
Whose phone?

01:47.166 --> 01:48.834
Charlie's.

01:52.104 --> 01:53.238
What are you gonna do?

01:53.272 --> 01:54.906
I'm gonna talk to him.

01:54.941 --> 01:56.908
Like you talked to Grindenko?

01:56.943 --> 01:58.810
This is Charlie
we're talking about.

01:58.845 --> 02:00.412
He's a foot soldier.

02:00.446 --> 02:03.782
Whoever's moving against you,
that's not Charlie. You know that.

02:03.816 --> 02:05.517
You know that.

02:08.054 --> 02:11.823
Whoever's sending him the texts, these
are the guys we're looking for.

02:12.425 --> 02:14.626
Give me Charlie's
new cell number.

02:14.660 --> 02:17.028
Next time he receives
an empty text, I'll know.

02:17.063 --> 02:18.763
We'll know.

02:21.901 --> 02:25.437
Come on, Jimmy, if this is going
to work, you've gotta trust me.

03:06.379 --> 03:09.548
The bus driver gets pretty pissed if
you don't have the correct change.

03:09.582 --> 03:11.283
Eugh.

03:13.019 --> 03:14.886
Any ID?

03:14.921 --> 03:17.489
Hector Diaz and Lee Garza.

03:18.724 --> 03:23.662
A couple of locals identified them as
low-ranking members of Lazlo's crew.

03:23.696 --> 03:27.899
Enjoy the moment. I reckon these are the
guys who tried to fry you and Fleming.

03:28.568 --> 03:32.537
What is this?
Clay Street retaliation?

03:33.372 --> 03:36.341
Well, Jimmy's
pretty relaxed if it is.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.077
My guess? Their heads
have been gift-wrapped.

03:39.111 --> 03:41.279
A peace offering
from Jimmy to Clay Street.

03:41.314 --> 03:45.150
Christ. Jimmy said he'd
do anything to help.

03:46.619 --> 03:49.287
I didn't anticipate
decapitating his own guys.

03:50.856 --> 03:55.093
Alright. Check this is some kind of
perverted truce and just do the paperwork.

03:55.127 --> 03:56.861
- Sure.
- Hey.

03:56.896 --> 04:00.465
Tread carefully. We can't afford
more blood on the sidewalk.

04:02.535 --> 04:05.203
Oh, and I'd lay off the
sweet and sour for a while.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.458
The heads were your idea.

04:28.327 --> 04:29.995
Yeah.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.898
That worked well.

04:35.368 --> 04:37.035
Yeah, I'd say so.

04:38.771 --> 04:40.438
You got us off the hook.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.208
For now.

04:44.877 --> 04:49.848
How do you think the crew feel knowing every
time you fuck something up, they pay?

04:51.751 --> 04:53.084
They were punks.

04:53.119 --> 04:55.987
You gave an order, they followed it.
What's the problem?

04:56.022 --> 04:59.190
You take care of your people,
you don't murder them.

05:00.292 --> 05:02.927
You didn't even put one in
their temples, for God's sake.

05:02.962 --> 05:05.130
You decapitated them. Jesus.

05:05.698 --> 05:09.801
Those boys died because
you disobeyed me.

05:10.803 --> 05:12.470
That's not leadership.

05:13.239 --> 05:15.306
You want to sit in
this chair one day?

05:16.809 --> 05:18.677
Hm?

05:18.711 --> 05:20.412
You remember that.

05:23.015 --> 05:24.683
You remember that.

05:32.391 --> 05:34.659
Hey, hey, that was a genius
move, big brother.

05:34.694 --> 05:36.661
I could have
done with you inside.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.431
Don't you fucking patronize me.

06:25.111 --> 06:26.778
(Car alarm)

06:34.920 --> 06:37.989
- What the hell're you up to?
- Christ, you're suspicious.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.724
Anyone would think
you'd been a cop.

06:39.759 --> 06:41.426
Jesus Christ, Wilson.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.361
Knowing people's
a two-way street.

06:43.395 --> 06:45.497
I'm familiar
with all your little habits.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.966
I don't have time for
reminiscing. Get out.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.737
(Sighs) Two young guys with nowhere
to put their "I love Oakland" caps.

06:52.772 --> 06:54.272
It's kind of crude.

06:54.306 --> 06:56.007
Especially for Jimmy.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.345
I take it by your silence you
know what I'm talking about.

07:02.081 --> 07:03.782
So what do you want?

07:03.816 --> 07:05.984
We got headless corpses.

07:06.018 --> 07:08.119
Did Jimmy and Clay Street
do a deal?

07:08.154 --> 07:10.755
Do we have peace
breaking out in the city?

07:11.924 --> 07:13.591
Open your shirt.

07:13.626 --> 07:15.760
Let's not be formal. I'll
just take off my pants.

07:15.795 --> 07:17.462
Open your shirt.

07:18.664 --> 07:20.331
I'm not wired.

07:22.168 --> 07:23.902
I wouldn't do it to you,
Travis.

07:26.205 --> 07:28.606
The Lee brothers
wanted money or blood.

07:28.641 --> 07:30.642
- The debt's settled.
- Good.

07:31.110 --> 07:32.777
My turn.

07:33.445 --> 07:35.647
What's Hernandez's
next move on Jimmy?

07:35.681 --> 07:37.982
Nothing.

07:38.017 --> 07:39.450
Nothing?

07:39.485 --> 07:40.785
Hallelujah.

07:40.820 --> 07:43.721
By-the-book Hernandez has
finally seen the light.

07:45.124 --> 07:46.558
I don't get it.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.860
She's pulling back from the
investigation.

07:48.894 --> 07:50.628
She doesn't want any trouble.

07:51.964 --> 07:53.631
Hernandez?

07:55.734 --> 07:57.402
I'll be seeing you.

08:13.252 --> 08:14.385
Hi.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.321
I got Charlie's
new cell number.

08:17.323 --> 08:20.058
We can get your guy at the
phone company to track it.

08:20.092 --> 08:23.294
Who Charlie calls,
where he goes.

08:23.329 --> 08:25.697
And most important,
most important,

08:25.731 --> 08:28.933
when he receives another empty
text. You got it?

08:28.968 --> 08:30.668
Already on it.

08:31.003 --> 08:34.739
Hernandez is taking her foot off
the gas on Jimmy and Clay Street.

08:34.773 --> 08:36.140
Oh.

08:36.174 --> 08:37.876
Well, let me work something.

08:38.577 --> 08:40.778
See if I can make
Hernandez as the mole.

08:42.248 --> 08:44.182
You're thinking
like a cop again.

08:45.551 --> 08:48.753
In that case, want me to
run Jimmy's new number too?

08:56.595 --> 09:00.899
By going back into that fire you
showed not only outstanding courage

09:00.933 --> 09:04.936
but the true qualities
of leadership.

09:04.970 --> 09:08.973
Lieutenant Hernandez, myself
and the entire department

09:09.008 --> 09:10.708
are in your debt.

09:11.577 --> 09:14.078
You have a hell of a future
in front of you, son.

09:14.113 --> 09:15.513
Thank you, sir.

09:15.547 --> 09:17.448
- Well done, buddy.
- (Applause)

09:18.284 --> 09:19.951
Thank you.

09:26.759 --> 09:28.159
Congratulations.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.827
Is there something
I should know?

09:29.862 --> 09:31.029
Meaning?

09:31.063 --> 09:33.564
You're taking your
foot off of Jimmy Lazlo.

09:34.566 --> 09:37.168
The perps were "delivered".

09:37.202 --> 09:39.537
Two fucking heads?

09:39.571 --> 09:41.739
That boy could have died
in that fire.

09:41.774 --> 09:43.708
Saving your life.

09:43.742 --> 09:47.245
I'm aware of that, sir. And
I know how much I owe him.

09:47.279 --> 09:49.681
We don't have anything
connecting Lazlo to the fire.

09:49.715 --> 09:53.451
If I was fully resourced I'd be
pursing Jimmy Lazlo 24/7.

09:54.286 --> 09:57.088
The Lazlos and Clay Street
aren't spraying the sidewalks

09:57.122 --> 10:00.124
and I owe it to decent folk to
keep it that way.

10:00.159 --> 10:02.060
- Whatever the cost.
- Is that it?

10:02.995 --> 10:05.730
You're gonna blame it
on budget cuts?

10:05.764 --> 10:07.565
That's not what I'm saying.

10:07.599 --> 10:10.935
I want to be kept informed of every
detail of your investigation.

10:10.970 --> 10:14.339
Tony Aldon dies, two of Jimmy's
crew turn up with no heads.

10:15.207 --> 10:17.842
Lazlo's empire is in turmoil.

10:17.876 --> 10:20.078
Apply the pressure.

10:20.112 --> 10:21.813
Finish him off.

10:37.029 --> 10:38.696
Hey, Charlie.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.299
Hey, Jimmy.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.034
- You eaten?
- No.

10:43.702 --> 10:45.837
How about some clams
over in Seaport?

10:56.248 --> 10:58.316
Let's get out of the office.

10:58.350 --> 11:00.952
(Crowd cheers and game
commentary on radio)

11:03.589 --> 11:06.190
'This has historically been
a good park for pitchers.

11:06.225 --> 11:09.193
Hitters will have more success
shooting for gaps in base hits

11:09.228 --> 11:11.462
than they will trying to
hit the long ball.

11:12.398 --> 11:14.799
Here's a ball hit hard
along the ground...'

11:19.471 --> 11:21.806
- (Crowd cheers)
- 'Cross swings and misses

11:21.840 --> 11:23.941
as he strikes out
for out number two.'

11:25.277 --> 11:26.944
(Commentary continues)

12:31.777 --> 12:33.444
Maybe it's age.

12:34.847 --> 12:36.514
Christ.

12:38.784 --> 12:40.451
I've been shot at before.

12:42.321 --> 12:47.725
You start thinking about what's
important,

12:47.759 --> 12:49.694
what really matters.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.234
You and me...

12:59.104 --> 13:00.771
how many years now?

13:02.274 --> 13:04.609
- 25?
- 27.

13:06.178 --> 13:07.845
27.

13:22.794 --> 13:24.462
(Car door slams)

13:40.312 --> 13:41.979
(Trickle of liquid)

13:49.087 --> 13:50.755
(Chuckles)

13:58.530 --> 14:01.766
- What?
- I drove him past the spit.

14:03.502 --> 14:05.169
What the hell were you doing?

14:05.204 --> 14:07.405
What am I going to do,
wait for some blank text?

14:07.439 --> 14:08.873
No, you rattle Charlie

14:08.907 --> 14:12.109
enough to make him arrange to meet
with whoever he's working for.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.212
We do not freak him
the fuck out.

14:14.913 --> 14:17.515
If he thinks we're on him
for real, he'll take off.

14:17.549 --> 14:19.483
Christ, Jimmy.

14:19.518 --> 14:21.152
You told me not to kill him.

14:21.186 --> 14:22.320
I didn't kill him.

14:22.354 --> 14:24.855
We flush out Charlie's
conspirators my way.

14:25.624 --> 14:27.291
Alright.

14:27.326 --> 14:29.026
(Whispers) You're the cop.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.268
Did you order Alec
to kill those guys?

14:45.177 --> 14:46.844
No.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.397
What?

15:08.333 --> 15:10.001
You cut off their heads?

15:13.672 --> 15:16.007
What, are you going to
start on me too now?

15:36.962 --> 15:38.629
I owe you an apology.

15:39.498 --> 15:41.766
The way you negotiated with
Clay Street.

15:42.768 --> 15:45.703
It was brave.
Brave and smart.

15:46.204 --> 15:49.140
Smarter than your brother's
solution. Jesus.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.577
I had a plan for you.

15:54.346 --> 15:56.013
Alec.

15:58.116 --> 16:01.519
The market's shrunk. The Chinese are
taking over the whole fucking city.

16:01.553 --> 16:03.821
It's hard,
getting harder to make money,

16:03.855 --> 16:07.224
so I thought...buy a bank.

16:09.161 --> 16:10.961
- A bank?
- A small private bank.

16:11.730 --> 16:14.632
Get everybody else to break
their balls chasing the dollar.

16:14.666 --> 16:19.170
They deposit their proceeds with us, we
launder it at a reasonable commission.

16:20.539 --> 16:23.374
I buy a vineyard,
you get to be CEO.

16:26.511 --> 16:30.548
So...what went wrong?

16:30.582 --> 16:33.351
I've been creaming off our
profits for some time.

16:34.152 --> 16:35.920
I didn't tell anyone.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.988
Not your bother, nobody.

16:38.023 --> 16:40.257
Robbing banks
they get...buying?

16:41.593 --> 16:43.127
Tony was laundering the money.

16:43.161 --> 16:46.497
Building a paper trail, bringing
it back into the US clean.

16:46.531 --> 16:51.202
The day before he was due to
close the deal, he was shot.

16:52.070 --> 16:53.738
And?

16:55.741 --> 16:57.408
Dad?

16:58.410 --> 17:00.077
I went to get the money.

17:02.114 --> 17:03.781
It wasn't in the account.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.017
- Where is it?
- I've no fucking idea.

17:07.051 --> 17:09.153
25 million.

17:09.186 --> 17:11.155
Disappeared
in the fucking ether.

17:11.189 --> 17:14.090
- 25 million?
- If I don't come up with the money in three days,

17:14.126 --> 17:17.461
the whole deal's sunk.
It's gone.

17:18.363 --> 17:20.731
Was it Tony?
Was he stealing from you?

17:20.766 --> 17:22.199
I don't know.

17:22.233 --> 17:24.602
Maybe. Maybe he was
working for someone.

17:25.904 --> 17:28.339
- Who?
- Someone here.

17:30.809 --> 17:32.743
Here?

17:32.778 --> 17:35.546
So you think one of the crew
is moving against you?

17:40.185 --> 17:41.852
Jesus.

17:49.594 --> 17:51.262
I know you and Jacks, Dad...

17:53.165 --> 17:55.633
I go away to prison
and she isn't here.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.802
I come home, she's invited
to family parties.

17:57.836 --> 17:59.537
Jacks is okay.

17:59.571 --> 18:01.372
- I'm just thinking.
- She's okay.

18:01.406 --> 18:03.107
She brings in good business.

18:04.309 --> 18:05.976
Right now we need it.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.381
I got the business degree, Dad.

18:10.415 --> 18:12.316
Mm-hm.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.051
If I can help...

18:16.555 --> 18:18.289
Did Tony leave any paperwork?

18:46.785 --> 18:48.652
Your guest, Mr. Lazlo.

18:48.687 --> 18:50.054
Thanks.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.789
Please.

18:56.561 --> 18:58.229
Yeah, thanks.

19:04.002 --> 19:07.004
Thank you for agreeing to
meet me on such short notice.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.940
You have your father's taste.

19:10.909 --> 19:12.576
In some things.

19:14.513 --> 19:16.080
Did you tell him
we were meeting?

19:16.114 --> 19:17.815
Did you?

19:20.085 --> 19:21.952
Dad's got a lot going on
right now.

19:23.822 --> 19:25.890
Tony's murder, the
assassination attempt.

19:25.924 --> 19:27.925
Yeah, I know.
I took the bullet.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.060
And I thank you for that,
believe me.

19:31.363 --> 19:33.230
But I'm here now.

19:33.265 --> 19:34.965
Dad's got me to support him.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.608
How about your family, Jackie?

19:46.144 --> 19:48.646
- My family?
- Yeah. You got any?

19:50.348 --> 19:52.449
My dad's dead.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.652
Mom hitched up
to a bottle of whiskey.

19:57.122 --> 19:59.189
Did Dad ever talk to you
about my mom?

20:00.125 --> 20:01.792
No.

20:03.261 --> 20:05.262
They were high school
sweethearts.

20:07.465 --> 20:09.300
Way back.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.101
You know, when he had nothing.

20:13.705 --> 20:15.372
She passed a few years ago.

20:18.109 --> 20:21.445
A love like that only comes
once a lifetime.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.014
Why don't we cut the crap?

20:24.649 --> 20:26.984
I get that you want to protect
your father.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.719
That's family, right?

20:29.421 --> 20:32.456
You think I'm after his money?
Let me tell you,

20:32.490 --> 20:35.926
there are easier ways for a woman
like me to part a guy from his cash

20:35.961 --> 20:37.661
than working the docks.

20:44.102 --> 20:45.769
What do you recommend?

20:47.439 --> 20:49.139
No idea.

20:49.174 --> 20:50.874
Never been here before.

20:52.811 --> 20:55.613
You know, Fat Lucy's
is right around the corner.

20:55.647 --> 20:57.715
Does the best burgers
in the Bay Area.

20:57.749 --> 21:00.918
A friend of mine drives 40
miles for their cheeseburger.

21:01.987 --> 21:03.621
Fat Lucy's?

21:03.655 --> 21:06.090
Shall we get out of here,
go there instead?

21:07.425 --> 21:09.326
(Cellphone rings)

21:12.697 --> 21:14.365
I'm busy.

21:17.535 --> 21:19.203
Yeah. I'll be right there.

21:22.574 --> 21:25.476
I'm sorry. I gotta take
a rain check.

21:44.896 --> 21:46.563
- Tom...
- Grace.

21:47.699 --> 21:49.433
- Who hit here?
- What do you mean?

21:49.467 --> 21:52.569
- Are you okay, sweetheart?
- Didn't you get my message?

21:52.604 --> 21:54.304
Evie hit Miss Morrison.

21:55.173 --> 21:56.840
- What?
- Yes.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.343
What the hell
did you do to her?

21:59.377 --> 22:01.545
Okay. Jesus Christ, Grace.

22:01.579 --> 22:02.913
Nothing.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.648
It's okay.

22:04.683 --> 22:06.817
It's okay.
Evie was upset earlier.

22:06.851 --> 22:08.886
Shelley was trying to
comfort her.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.255
It's understandable.

22:11.289 --> 22:15.292
She's lost someone very close to
her, someone she loved dearly.

22:15.326 --> 22:17.961
Grief can creep up on us
any time.

22:17.996 --> 22:21.365
My God. You say that kind of shit to Evie?
I'm not surprised she hit you.

22:21.399 --> 22:23.901
Grace. That is enough.

22:25.737 --> 22:27.404
I apologize.

22:29.207 --> 22:30.874
This is all a shock.

22:34.179 --> 22:36.013
She's been suspended
from school.

22:36.047 --> 22:37.748
Until further notice.

23:20.058 --> 23:21.725
Evie?

24:36.868 --> 24:38.535
(Cellphone rings)

24:43.341 --> 24:44.942
Yeah, hello?

24:44.976 --> 24:46.910
Charlie get an empty text yet?

24:46.945 --> 24:48.378
'No.'

24:48.413 --> 24:50.314
I said I'd call.

24:52.050 --> 24:53.717
(Line goes dead)

25:10.802 --> 25:12.469
(Game commentary on TV)

25:28.386 --> 25:30.053
Hey, Charlie.

25:31.189 --> 25:32.856
- I didn't see you.
- Hey.

25:35.693 --> 25:37.761
Don't leave on my account.

25:37.795 --> 25:39.162
No, I'm not. I'm just...

25:39.197 --> 25:41.965
I'll just knock this back
and leave you in peace.

25:42.767 --> 25:44.768
Can I get another whiskey
on my tab?

25:45.336 --> 25:46.904
You don't have to
buy me a drink?

25:46.938 --> 25:48.639
What's the harm?

25:56.714 --> 26:00.717
Cos I'm not sure Jimmy would appreciate
me and you drinking together.

26:00.752 --> 26:03.186
If Jimmy can't trust you,
who can he trust?

26:05.456 --> 26:07.958
You left me hanging there,
Charlie.

26:07.992 --> 26:09.860
The Grindenko bust.

26:09.894 --> 26:13.030
You kicked out of there
and left me high and dry.

26:13.064 --> 26:14.698
Sorry.

26:14.732 --> 26:17.801
- I was in flight mode.
- Yeah.

26:22.674 --> 26:24.474
Can we make a toast?

26:24.509 --> 26:26.576
Sure.

26:26.611 --> 26:28.312
To my son...

26:30.181 --> 26:31.848
..who died a while back.

26:35.386 --> 26:37.054
He was seven years old.

26:39.524 --> 26:41.191
Oh.

26:42.493 --> 26:44.161
Is this the anniversary?

26:46.331 --> 26:48.565
Every day's the anniversary.

26:52.470 --> 26:54.137
How did he...

26:57.442 --> 26:59.109
Wrong place, wrong time.

27:06.351 --> 27:08.018
To Matthew.

27:08.686 --> 27:10.354
To Matthew.

27:17.829 --> 27:21.365
Me and Nancy planned on having
kids.

27:24.068 --> 27:25.869
She said she wanted a houseful.

27:29.474 --> 27:32.943
But she got diagnosed with MS not
long after our wedding, so...

27:34.912 --> 27:36.580
We had a change of plans.

27:38.850 --> 27:40.517
We had them changed for us.

27:46.858 --> 27:48.525
She cut me loose.

27:50.161 --> 27:51.995
That's what she said.

27:52.030 --> 27:53.397
Said she cut me loose

27:53.431 --> 27:55.198
so that I could
go and build a life

27:55.233 --> 27:57.667
with somebody who wouldn't need
her ass wiped.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.141
I couldn't do that.

28:05.276 --> 28:06.943
Till death do us part.

28:11.883 --> 28:13.817
To Nancy.

28:13.851 --> 28:15.552
Nancy.

28:21.793 --> 28:23.460
How's she doing?

28:26.130 --> 28:27.798
Not good.

28:28.232 --> 28:29.900
But we don't talk about it.

28:31.202 --> 28:32.869
God, Charlie, I'm sorry.

28:35.406 --> 28:37.374
I mean, the cost
of the treatment,

28:37.408 --> 28:39.443
that must be painful enough,
right?

28:40.011 --> 28:42.879
Insurance premiums. They've
gotta be nailing you.

28:44.415 --> 28:46.283
I don't pay insurance premiums.

28:47.718 --> 28:49.519
We got dropped from the policy.

28:50.321 --> 28:51.521
What?

28:51.556 --> 28:53.990
Nancy is not cost-effective.

28:55.493 --> 28:57.494
My wife is dying

28:57.528 --> 29:01.164
and those motherfuckers dropped
our insurance policy.

29:27.492 --> 29:29.159
What's so urgent?

29:31.996 --> 29:33.630
I think I got the motive.

29:33.664 --> 29:35.332
Motive?

29:35.366 --> 29:37.701
Why Charlie's changed sides.

29:37.735 --> 29:40.604
Why he's part of the move
against you.

29:40.638 --> 29:42.339
He's drowning in debt.

29:43.574 --> 29:45.675
They pulled Nancy's
health insurance.

29:45.710 --> 29:47.878
He never told me.

29:48.378 --> 29:50.379
Maybe he didn't think
you'd be interested.

29:50.413 --> 29:51.914
No, he would have told me.

29:51.948 --> 29:53.649
Well, he told me, Jimmy.

29:54.284 --> 29:57.453
You know, she's sick,
needs a lot of care.

29:57.487 --> 29:59.588
This is crazy.
I'm going to talk to him.

29:59.623 --> 30:03.525
No, no. We agreed, we agreed.
Rattle, not freak.

30:05.195 --> 30:07.963
We need Charlie to arrange
a meet with the real players.

30:09.299 --> 30:11.233
Now, we do
what all good detectives do

30:11.267 --> 30:13.969
and we get to Charlie
where he's vulnerable.

30:14.004 --> 30:15.571
Through Nancy.

30:16.706 --> 30:18.974
He loves her, Jimmy.

30:19.009 --> 30:21.510
And she's gone soon.
He can't bear it.

30:31.454 --> 30:33.122
You smell of whiskey.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.191
Are you drunk?

30:36.226 --> 30:37.526
I don't know. A little.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.428
Did Charlie hit on you?

30:39.462 --> 30:41.163
That is not your business.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.834
But you are my business.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.316
Who am I with right now?

31:03.553 --> 31:05.220
Grace or Jackie?

31:06.222 --> 31:07.890
There is no Jackie.

31:12.195 --> 31:13.862
Are you sure about that?

31:57.407 --> 31:59.074
(Cellphone vibrates)

32:02.879 --> 32:04.546
(Cellphone rings)

32:07.917 --> 32:08.917
Mitch?

32:08.952 --> 32:11.820
'One of the phones sent Charlie
an empty text.'

32:12.589 --> 32:15.591
That phone was sitting
right outside Sam's school

32:15.625 --> 32:17.326
the day he was shot.

32:49.559 --> 32:51.260
Why isn't Charlie
taking care of this?

32:51.294 --> 32:53.529
He hasn't been
on top of things lately.

32:55.031 --> 32:56.131
I need to talk to you.

32:56.166 --> 32:57.866
I'm busy.

32:59.335 --> 33:01.003
(Low exchange)

33:08.344 --> 33:10.646
You didn't pick up your
phone. I went by your house.

33:10.680 --> 33:11.880
What do you want?

33:11.915 --> 33:13.715
We got a link.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.217
I need you to come.

33:15.251 --> 33:16.251
(Mutters)

33:16.286 --> 33:17.653
Now.

33:17.687 --> 33:19.388
Outside in five minutes.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.105
Jackie.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.607
Max.

33:38.641 --> 33:41.476
I'm just going for a coffee.
You want to join me?

33:41.511 --> 33:43.212
No. Thank you.

33:44.347 --> 33:46.949
Your dad and I have got
some business to close.

33:47.951 --> 33:50.819
Everything okay after
you got pulled from lunch?

33:50.854 --> 33:52.154
Yeah, fine.

33:52.188 --> 33:54.556
Just a consignment docket
that got lost.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.227
We should do it again sometime.

33:59.696 --> 34:01.363
Yeah, I'd like that.

34:01.798 --> 34:03.465
See you.

34:04.467 --> 34:06.134
You can count on it.

34:18.214 --> 34:19.882
The deal, Max.

34:20.550 --> 34:22.551
That's all Jacks
is interested in.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.167
What link?

34:39.202 --> 34:41.270
One of the guys who
sent a text to Charlie.

34:41.304 --> 34:45.072
That piece of shit was standing outside
my son's school the day he was shot.

34:45.108 --> 34:46.875
Charlie knows who killed Sam.

34:48.844 --> 34:52.114
And it's the same piece of shit
who tried to take you out.

34:52.148 --> 34:54.216
Come on. What are you doing?

34:54.250 --> 34:56.018
Driving. You're too pumped.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.452
I am one step away, Jimmy.

34:57.487 --> 34:58.987
We're too close
to fuck this up.

34:59.022 --> 35:00.789
Charlie fucking knows.

35:00.823 --> 35:02.124
And we gotta find him.

35:02.158 --> 35:04.559
Jesus, you're the one who made
the plan, alright?

35:04.594 --> 35:06.094
Tread carefully.

35:06.129 --> 35:07.863
We pay a courtesy call
on Nancy,

35:07.897 --> 35:10.065
see how tough things are, what
she gives us.

35:10.099 --> 35:12.501
Charlie hears I made
a home visit, he'll worry.

35:12.535 --> 35:13.902
Come on, out.

35:13.937 --> 35:16.538
Or I'm dragging you out.
Come on.

35:22.879 --> 35:24.546
Alright, alright.

35:47.003 --> 35:48.370
Maybe today he won't leave.

35:48.404 --> 35:51.073
Every Saturday
Charlie goes to the diner.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.342
Watches the pre-game,
lays a few bets.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.047
I've known the guy a long time.

35:59.082 --> 36:00.983
We came up
on the docks together.

36:03.353 --> 36:05.020
I'm sorry.

36:06.155 --> 36:08.023
Charlie, man.

36:08.057 --> 36:09.758
I'll get over it.

36:26.876 --> 36:28.543
Yeah, yeah.

36:33.449 --> 36:35.517
- Come on, come on.
- Relax.

36:35.551 --> 36:37.719
It takes Nancy time
to get to the door.

36:39.589 --> 36:41.890
Oh. Hello.

36:44.193 --> 36:47.029
Mr. Lazlo
and Miss Hays to see you.

36:47.063 --> 36:49.297
- Jimmy!
- Nancy.

36:50.266 --> 36:52.034
Jackie.

36:52.068 --> 36:54.936
You look even more beautiful
than you did at Max's party.

36:54.971 --> 36:56.438
You're too kind.

36:56.472 --> 36:58.306
- I brought flowers.
- They're lovely.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.375
- Shall I take those?
- Yes, please.

37:01.144 --> 37:02.411
Thanks.

37:02.445 --> 37:04.913
This is such a great surprise.

37:05.448 --> 37:07.549
The last time
you came by was...

37:07.583 --> 37:09.284
Before Maddie died.

37:10.286 --> 37:12.320
I know. I apologize.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.556
No, I understand.

37:14.590 --> 37:17.025
It's going to hit Charlie hard
too when I...

37:18.628 --> 37:20.095
Hey, ssh.

37:20.129 --> 37:21.830
I'm counting on you, Jimmy.

37:22.465 --> 37:24.933
You've got to see him
through this, okay?

37:24.967 --> 37:27.669
You've got some serious
equipment here, Nancy.

37:28.204 --> 37:31.740
Yeah, the control room,
Charlie calls it.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.510
I'd love to know what insurance
company you're with.

37:35.545 --> 37:38.580
I mean, how the hell does
Charlie manage the premiums?

37:39.715 --> 37:41.383
Do you mind her hearing this?

37:42.885 --> 37:44.553
No.

37:46.189 --> 37:50.358
I felt dreadful about the money.
I mean, right from the start.

37:51.394 --> 37:54.329
It's such a relief to finally
be able to say thank you.

37:55.431 --> 37:58.900
Charlie said that
you wanted to keep it quiet.

37:58.935 --> 38:01.369
Between him and you.

38:02.371 --> 38:05.273
But, Jimmy, you saved my life.

38:06.309 --> 38:08.743
Without all this...

38:10.379 --> 38:12.781
well, I wouldn't be here.

38:18.688 --> 38:20.889
- Charlie.
- What are you doing here?

38:21.591 --> 38:23.258
Who gave you the money?

38:25.795 --> 38:27.262
Who gave you the fucking money?

38:27.296 --> 38:29.431
- Get her off me!
- Don't hurt him.

38:29.465 --> 38:31.032
Get this bitch off me!

38:31.067 --> 38:33.001
- You want me to call 911?
- No cops.

38:33.035 --> 38:34.236
- Give me a name!
- Ow!

38:34.270 --> 38:35.303
Give me a fucking name!

38:35.338 --> 38:37.305
- Shut up!
- Give me a fucking name!

38:37.340 --> 38:40.308
Hey, calm down. Calm down!

38:40.343 --> 38:42.878
You are fucking this up.

38:42.912 --> 38:44.613
I will handle it.

38:45.848 --> 38:48.583
You fucking go back in there,
I swear I will hurt you.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.318
Now, go in the fucking car.

38:52.655 --> 38:54.189
Hm?

38:54.223 --> 38:55.924
In the fucking car.

38:58.361 --> 39:01.296
(Front door opens and closes)

39:19.182 --> 39:20.815
We need to talk.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.658
It's going to be alright.

39:39.001 --> 39:42.637
Whatever he's done,
don't kill him.

39:42.672 --> 39:44.639
Oh, Jimmy,
please don't kill him.

39:45.274 --> 39:46.942
Please.

40:23.279 --> 40:24.946
Why didn't you come to me?

40:30.686 --> 40:33.255
Cos you seemed to have
other things on your mind.

40:33.289 --> 40:36.625
For us. Everything
I was doing was for us.

40:45.501 --> 40:47.902
Who gave you the money,
Charlie?

40:47.937 --> 40:49.638
Hm?

40:50.273 --> 40:52.607
Give me a name.

40:52.642 --> 40:54.342
I'll protect you.

40:57.046 --> 40:59.914
I'll look after Nancy.
You have my word.

41:01.784 --> 41:04.386
You're my oldest friend,
Charlie.

42:03.079 --> 42:04.412
Did he give you a name?

42:04.447 --> 42:07.148
You almost blew it.
Your cover, the whole deal.

42:09.685 --> 42:11.252
Jimmy!

42:11.287 --> 42:14.723
You're right. I haven't
been paying attention.

42:16.058 --> 42:17.559
So what, we just drive away?

42:17.593 --> 42:19.861
He isn't going to skip town
and abandon Nancy.

42:19.895 --> 42:23.631
I'm guessing he's going to contact whoever
gave him the money and arrange to meet.

42:23.666 --> 42:27.469
Alright? He's not going anywhere if
he thinks we're sitting outside.

42:29.271 --> 42:31.072
Trust me. Hm?

42:32.041 --> 42:33.875
There'll be an empty text.

44:10.406 --> 44:12.407
I'm sorry you lost your son.

44:34.997 --> 44:36.664
(Cellphone rings)

44:38.067 --> 44:39.067
Yeah?

44:39.101 --> 44:40.869
Charlie's broken the pattern.

44:40.903 --> 44:44.105
He's sent an empty text.
Maybe he wants a meet.

44:44.139 --> 44:45.540
Whose phone did he text?

44:45.574 --> 44:48.076
A new number. I never
came across it before.

44:50.179 --> 44:51.846
We're on.

45:58.547 --> 46:00.214
(Cellphone rings)

46:02.418 --> 46:03.451
Hello.

46:05.054 --> 46:08.723
Get your phone guy to send another
empty text from Charlie's phone.

46:11.627 --> 46:14.729
There's never been two texts
sent in a row before.

46:14.763 --> 46:17.799
Well, I'm staring at
an empty horizon here.

46:19.234 --> 46:20.902
Send another empty text.

46:21.937 --> 46:24.205
- Wait, wait, wait...
- (Line goes dead)

47:00.542 --> 47:01.676
Shit.

47:01.710 --> 47:04.412
- We should go after him.
- No, we wait for Charlie.

47:08.217 --> 47:09.884
I mean, what's going on?

47:11.787 --> 47:13.421
Where the hell is he?

47:13.455 --> 47:15.289
There's something wrong.

47:15.324 --> 47:17.025
Why isn't he here?

47:18.861 --> 47:20.528
We better get back to Charlie.

47:33.676 --> 47:36.110
Charlie! Hey!

47:37.513 --> 47:39.180
Charlie!

47:39.782 --> 47:41.215
- You can't come in.
- Charlie...

47:41.250 --> 47:43.685
- Mrs. McGinley isn't...
- (Jimmy shouts)

47:44.520 --> 47:45.853
Nancy, where's Charlie?

47:45.888 --> 47:49.323
He's in his den watching the game.
What is it? What's going on?

47:53.195 --> 47:54.562
(Game commentary)

47:54.596 --> 47:55.930
Yeah.

47:56.532 --> 47:58.199
(Game commentary)
