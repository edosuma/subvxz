Ooh. Boy, I love when you come over.
You always got the good stories.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.820
Hey, did your mama ever tell you
how she got stood up for homecoming?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.365
She did not. Go on.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.492
Oh. It was so sad.

10:59.575 --> 11:03.120
She worried Mama to death
about this fancy dress

11:03.204 --> 11:05.790
and then her date didn't even show up.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.834
Daddy made Lucretia take her. [chuckles]

11:08.918 --> 11:11.545
What fool did that
to my poor baby? [chuckles]

11:11.629 --> 11:13.047
You, jackass.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.509
That's Lucretia.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.386
Always there for me.

11:18.469 --> 11:23.057
[chuckles] Of course she was. She was
just happy to get asked to a dance.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.977
Well, at least I didn't get VD.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.730
What's VD?

11:31.148 --> 11:33.442
Uh, Valentine's Day.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.447
Aww! Aunt Lucretia didn't get a VD?

11:39.240 --> 11:40.116
No, baby.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.703
I wasn't running around
with a pimp like your Aunt Althea.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.413
He wasn't a pimp.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.624
He just liked to
sit on his Cadillac and people-watch.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.293
That's a pimp.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.756
-What's a pimp?
-Hey, I got news.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.218
I got a daughter
I didn't even know about. She's nine.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.513
[gasps] A new daughter
and a new boyfriend.

12:04.056 --> 12:09.228
What the universe withholds from one
gives abundance to another.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.479
[Bernard] Her name's Sydney.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.566
-Oh. That baby been here before.
-[chuckles]

12:13.649 --> 12:16.360
Now, your new guy, uh,
how does he and Sydney get along?

12:16.444 --> 12:18.904
Well, uh, they both get along with me.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.030
[chuckles]

12:20.114 --> 12:23.033
You still haven't told Hector
that you have a kid?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
He hasn't asked.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.080
Aunt Thea, you see what this is.
How do I get out of here?

12:29.915 --> 12:32.084
Mmm. Don't get pregnant at 16.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.420
Oh, please.
That's gonna be my first tattoo.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.173
-[phone alert]
-Uh…

12:37.882 --> 12:39.300
-[clears throat]
-What?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.094
Bennie, can I see you
in the kitchen, please?

12:42.762 --> 12:43.596
For what?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.848
[instrumental music playing]

12:45.931 --> 12:50.644
How did someone charge $500
for shoes on our card?

12:50.728 --> 12:52.772
Maybe they didn't realize
they could steal 'em.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.984
We about to dispute this. Mm-mmm.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.237
We can't afford this shit.
We 'bout to prosecute someone's ass.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.156
No, don't go all legal now.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.701
Maybe it's some good father out there
that just wants to show his son some love.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.080
Oh, damn. It was you.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.081
[phone alert]

13:11.916 --> 13:14.794
If that text is about
Aaliyah's jacket, I had to buy it.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.421
So she wouldn't tell you about the shoes.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.549
The text was from Lucretia
telling me to hurry up.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.886
Aaliyah said that she borrowed
that jacket from Savannah.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.513
How much was the jacket?

13:25.596 --> 13:27.097
Ask Savannah.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.350
[phone alert]

13:31.018 --> 13:32.770
Okay, it was $400.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.605
You better take that shit back.

13:34.688 --> 13:38.567
I can't take it back or she'll tell you
about the shoe… Oh, right.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.323
Mac and cheese is all crispy.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.451
Liyah, be a lamb
and come help your father,

13:47.535 --> 13:50.120
uh, count the cheeses.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.914
"Count the cheeses"?

13:51.997 --> 13:53.374
This feels like a setup.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.291
I'm good.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.335
Aaliyah.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.509
Is everything okay?
Is something going on with Aaliyah?

14:04.218 --> 14:06.637
No, she is fine.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.973
-[stomping]
-I hate this house!

14:11.392 --> 14:15.187
Would y'all excuse me?
Let me go check on this child.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.567
She went limp on me, but I got it.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.653
I'll tell you this,

14:22.736 --> 14:26.282
Mama would have never let us
get away with that attitude.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.908
Mmm. Okay.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.245
I don't blame her
for wanting a different life.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.080
All right, now.

14:33.163 --> 14:35.916
At least a different chair. Ugh, my back.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.419
Like I'm sitting in coach.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.132
Why don't you go sit your ass outside?

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
Excuse me?

14:45.759 --> 14:47.761
I knew I should have greased up my neck.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.973
I'm sick of you.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.685
Mm-hmm.
So what? You made it. Good for you.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.896
You ain't got to tear me down.

14:57.813 --> 15:02.067
[chuckling nervously] Lucretia,
can you believe all this hostility?

15:02.776 --> 15:03.903
Shut up, Althea.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.573
Pops, you think they gonna fight?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.910
Let's go.
If one of Lucretia's titties pop out,

15:10.993 --> 15:12.286
I'mma throw up.

15:14.204 --> 15:18.709
[scoffs] All this negative energy
is why I don't come around.

15:18.792 --> 15:19.835
Uh-uh. [chuckles]

15:19.919 --> 15:23.339
See, 'cause you
are the negative energy, all right?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.382
You're so full of yourself.

15:25.466 --> 15:29.720
Yeah, you big phony. Flying around,
helping everyone but your family.

15:29.803 --> 15:33.557
Acting like you the only one out here
with something going on.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.560
You ain't asked
one question about our lives.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.312
You ain't the only one with dreams.

15:38.395 --> 15:41.941
Yeah, Regina's trying to go back
to grad school to get her MBA.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.275
Cree got property.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.695
Properties. And a man out of town.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.782
Where is all this coming from?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.826
-You wanna stand on my back?
-[stutters]

15:53.619 --> 15:54.912
From how you are.

15:55.704 --> 15:59.375
Mm-hmm. All your little digs.
All your little comments.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.752
Talking about my disrespectful kids.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.338
My house is small. Lucretia's alone.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.340
Okay, you could have just stayed on you.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.219
Why are you attacking the truth?

16:10.302 --> 16:14.306
Aaliyah is disrespectful.
Your house is small. Lucretia is alone.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.391
He's out of town!

16:16.225 --> 16:19.103
It is my job to pinpoint peoples' issues.

16:20.354 --> 16:24.400
We're not your people.
We're your family and that shit hurts.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.651
A lot!

16:27.027 --> 16:31.073
Oh, my God, that is never my intention.
I am sorry you perceive it that way.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.159
There's no other way to "perceive" it.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.828
You know, I'm just at a loss.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.497
[sighs] Maybe it's best I leave.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.082
Lucretia is making a fist.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.460
Damn, I didn't even realize it.

16:44.962 --> 16:45.838
No.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.758
We said what we had to say. All right?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.553
So, you either gonna
take it to heart or not.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.679
You're our sister.

16:54.805 --> 16:55.931
You're staying for dinner.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.058
Well, thank you.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.103
It's not gonna be a long dinner anyway.
I ate before I came.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.563
This bitch.

17:04.064 --> 17:04.898
What?

17:04.982 --> 17:06.442
That's a button?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.987
[funky instrumental music playing]

17:11.822 --> 17:14.408
-I'm really glad we had tonight.
-Hmm.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.827
You know, it's nice to clear the air.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.121
And again, I'm so sorry.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.123
Hey. Uh-uh. We already did that.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.542
Yeah, come on, sis. We cool. We love you.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.835
All right. I love y'all.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.211
[all chuckling]

17:26.295 --> 17:29.882
Yeah. And next time I'm here, I'd like to
see a picture of me up in here.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.925
Ain't not one picture of me up in here.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.261
You got the Obamas,
but you ain't got no picture of me.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.804
-I love y'all!
-Love you.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.728
Look at us three being sisters. [chuckles]

17:42.811 --> 17:44.980
She really listened to us tonight.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.523
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-[laughs]

17:46.607 --> 17:49.485
Sucks that she has to leave
right after her speech tomorrow.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.738
Mm-hmm. Would have been nice
to have a bit more sister time.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.700
Hey. Now, I know she said
that we don't have to come,

17:56.784 --> 17:59.161
but let's surprise her at her talk

17:59.244 --> 18:01.914
and take her to lunch
before she goes to the airport.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.041
-I would love that.
-Yeah.

18:04.124 --> 18:07.920
Oh, I'm supposed to read to
some poor kids tomorrow, but I'll cancel.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.963
Are you talking about my kids?

18:11.882 --> 18:12.716
Yes, I was.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.934
[funky instrumental music playing]

18:22.893 --> 18:25.062
-Your mama here?
-No.

18:25.729 --> 18:26.939
That's good. [clears throat]

18:28.065 --> 18:30.609
I don't know how to tell you this
about them shoes, but…

18:30.692 --> 18:32.361
I'mma get the hat to go with them.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.821
Oh, damn, thank you.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.115
That's really nice of you.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.659
Yeah, you can't rock the kicks
without the fitted.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.035
Yeah, dads be knowing it.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.621
Hey, just don't make it no Jets cap.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.540
Oh, you know I wouldn't do that to you.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.582
[both] Boop.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.502
Yeah, can you take your "boop" in the back

18:48.585 --> 18:50.337
so I can have a second with my son?

18:50.420 --> 18:51.964
Yeah. Yeah, my bad.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.048
[Bennie] Yeah.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.888
-You're not getting me that hat, are you?
-No.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.851
And it gets worse.
I'mma need them shoes back, man.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.811
[chuckles] I can't do that.

19:06.478 --> 19:10.732
Okay, now, I just snatched a jacket off
Aaliyah's ass. I'll jump on you too.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.902
No, I mean I sold them.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.071
What? That was $500!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.322
Chill, look. Uh…

19:18.240 --> 19:19.491
I flipped them for eight.

19:19.575 --> 19:23.287
Oh, my God. I'm so proud of you.
Boy, you gonna make me cry.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.707
I need my cut though, come on.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.333
Dad, I was gonna break you off.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.336
Yeah. Well, I'm fine with you,

19:31.420 --> 19:34.006
but it's the Tasha part in you
that I don't trust.

19:34.089 --> 19:37.426
Here. Here, man.
We need to do this more often.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.552
Hell yeah.

19:38.635 --> 19:42.264
Well, might be a little difficult
when we move across town.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.226
Oh, man, $800 ain't no moving money.

19:47.603 --> 19:51.148
Uh, I mean when my mom and I
move in with Noah.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.400
Didn't she tell you?

19:53.483 --> 19:56.028
Of course she told me. [chuckles]

19:56.111 --> 19:58.280
She don't make a move
without me knowing it.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.492
Did she show you the pics of the house?

20:03.327 --> 20:04.578
How about that hot tub?

20:04.661 --> 20:05.871
Yeah.

20:05.954 --> 20:09.499
That's a whole lot of booty-soup in there,
but if that's how y'all rolling.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.670
Okay. Well, you, uh, ruined that for me.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.839
I gotta go finish my homework.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.383
Okay. I'll holler at you, boy.
I love you, son.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.426
-All right.
-Bye.

20:20.969 --> 20:21.970
[Bennie sighs]

20:23.889 --> 20:24.723
Damn!

20:25.474 --> 20:27.559
Taking my son. Okay. Yeah.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.687
All right. You gonna take something?
I'mma take this hot comb.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.481
[winces and groans]

20:34.316 --> 20:35.275
I'll take the hair.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.403
Take my son up outta here.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.406
Oh, shit.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.663
[funky instrumental music playing]

20:50.624 --> 20:53.835
We Thea's family.
Why are we in overflow? Damn.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.715
'Cause we got our tickets last minute.
And stop cussing in church.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.133
It's not our church.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.262
There's some chairs over here.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.891
-And a chair for you other there, heathen.
-[scoffs]

21:07.975 --> 21:10.018
[indistinct chatter]

21:10.102 --> 21:15.607
Good afternoon. Welcome to our second
annual Women's Fellowship Conference.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.276
[audience applauding]

21:17.359 --> 21:21.154
Without further ado, Althea Turner.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.704
Grand rising, go-getters.

21:29.413 --> 21:32.457
For the next two hours and 20 minutes…

21:32.541 --> 21:35.585
-No. That's The Godfather movie. I'm out.
-…we are going to explore…

21:37.337 --> 21:40.007
[funky instrumental music playing]

21:40.090 --> 21:41.466
We all have dreams.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.010
I know that's right.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.304
There's no elevator
to live in your dreams.

21:45.387 --> 21:49.057
You've got to take the stairs.
You've got to do the work.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.100
Say it, sis.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.979
Oh, that's not a Black thing.
She's actually my sister.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.357
[Althea] Dreams are beautiful.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.569
But we also need to be mindful

22:01.194 --> 22:03.447
of the realities of life.

22:03.530 --> 22:07.534
-[audience agreeing]
-We have kids! We have spouses.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.911
We have to take care of ourselves.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.204
[audience agreeing]

22:11.288 --> 22:13.415
That stuff still has to happen.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.667
Someone has to pick up the slack.

22:15.751 --> 22:19.671
Don't let your dreams
become someone else's nightmare.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.506
-Mm-hmm.
-[audience agreeing]

22:21.590 --> 22:22.716
[Althea] Of course,

22:23.967 --> 22:26.636
this can be hard to see sometimes.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.431
Especially when they're offering to help.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.767
-[audience agreeing]
-But all help ain't good help.

22:32.392 --> 22:37.522
Some people use help
as a down payment on their judgment.

22:38.106 --> 22:42.986
They feel entitled to be all up
in your business because they need it.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.322
[laughs] It's almost like a crutch.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.574
-[audience agreeing]
-Mmm. Been there.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.118
[Althea continues indistinctly]

22:51.578 --> 22:52.662
Been where?

23:04.216 --> 23:05.050
What?

23:05.759 --> 23:07.302
We gotta do this now?

23:07.386 --> 23:09.513
What was with that, "Been there"?

23:09.596 --> 23:10.764
You think I'm controlling?

23:10.847 --> 23:12.224
[chuckles sarcastically]

23:12.307 --> 23:15.685
Yeah, you just dragged me out
in the middle of her message.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.398
What was up with your nodding
and "mm-hmm"-ing?

23:19.481 --> 23:21.608
That's what you do
when you agree with something.

23:24.027 --> 23:26.571
So, my dream is your nightmare?

23:28.490 --> 23:30.117
You don't want me to go back to school.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.827
I didn't say that.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.706
But if you do,
there's a lot that's gonna fall on me.

23:36.790 --> 23:37.624
"If"?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.669
Now you don't even think I can get in.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.338
[scoffs] Stop reading into everything.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.632
When I go back to school.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.135
And nothing gonna fall on you
that hasn't already.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.428
So, everything?

23:51.888 --> 23:55.684
[scoffs] You really think you can
go back to school without me.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.269
Damn right I do.

23:57.352 --> 24:00.689
I know that your family
couldn't function without me.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.315
[laughing] Oh, is that right?

24:02.983 --> 24:05.777
You wouldn't have a life
if I didn't have a family.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.863
We're your hobby.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.157
So that's what you really think of me?

24:11.074 --> 24:14.035
Well, suddenly,
I have a lot of free time then.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.998
To do what?
Snuggle up with your drive-by boyfriend

24:18.081 --> 24:21.084
or go antiquing with friends
that you don't have?

24:21.168 --> 24:23.170
You know I hate antiquing.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.133
But maybe I would have a full life

24:28.216 --> 24:32.637
if I wasn't stuck raising your children
and paying your bills.

24:32.721 --> 24:36.475
Go back to playing Uno by your damn self.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.020
Ooh! You are lucky we are in God's house.

24:40.103 --> 24:43.982
Why? So He can watch Maya
while you go back to school?

24:44.065 --> 24:47.444
God already raised His kid. Twice.

24:49.404 --> 24:50.739
I'm getting out of here.

24:52.407 --> 24:55.619
-Your husband is still sleeping in there.
-[yells] I know it!

24:57.245 --> 25:02.083
[funky instrumental music playing]

25:02.167 --> 25:05.170
