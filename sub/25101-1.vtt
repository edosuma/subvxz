I wasn't expecting it.

I have no idea
how you do the flip

46:39.260 --> 46:41.459
and you land on your heels.

46:41.460 --> 46:42.559
That was insane.

46:42.560 --> 46:45.099
You guys just really
woke me up.

46:45.100 --> 46:47.759

Thank you so much!

46:47.760 --> 46:51.059

judging something like this,

46:51.060 --> 46:53.659
I always like to judge it on an
entertainment basis,

46:53.660 --> 46:55.499
I thought the first half
of the act,

46:55.500 --> 46:57.629
I've kinda seen it before.

46:57.630 --> 47:00.459
Then the second half,
the heels come on

47:00.460 --> 47:02.229

"America's Got Talent"?
- First off, I'm a rapper.

48:52.130 --> 48:53.499
I rap.
[cheering]

48:53.500 --> 48:55.999
Yeah.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.929
I started off because
before I was born,

48:57.930 --> 49:00.499
my father--he was a rapper.
- Yeah.

49:00.500 --> 49:03.659

49:03.660 --> 49:05.429
[exhales]
He died before I was born.

49:05.430 --> 49:08.559
So he couldn't really...
fulfill his dreams,

49:08.560 --> 49:11.199

He was on his way, like,
he was--

49:20.300 --> 49:22.799
He had signed
with Universal Records.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.699
My mom, she found out
she was pregnant.

we started dating

49:30.060 --> 49:32.129
when we were, like, teenagers.

49:32.130 --> 49:33.699
We were in love.

49:33.700 --> 49:37.559
We were on track
to really become a family.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.329
We had just moved in
our first house.

49:40.330 --> 49:44.860
A week or so later, I got the
call that he's been shot.

49:47.160 --> 49:49.259
- I think it was, like,
a rap rivalry.

49:49.260 --> 49:51.299
I'm not sure.

49:51.300 --> 49:54.599

me being pregnant his child--

49:54.600 --> 49:59.199
it was the most devastating
day of my life.

49:59.200 --> 50:01.599

50:06.560 --> 50:09.299
I just went into total shock.

"You're losing weight,

50:11.460 --> 50:13.929

gaining weight."

50:13.930 --> 50:16.529
He was so real, you know?

50:16.530 --> 50:20.529

I gotta make sure

50:20.530 --> 50:22.830
this baby is okay.

50:25.330 --> 50:28.499

50:28.500 --> 50:33.359

inheriting her dad's talent.

50:37.230 --> 50:39.629

a lot of people said,

50:39.630 --> 50:40.759

- Don't say it like that!

56:13.000 --> 56:14.299
- I shouldn't say it like that.
- I want to try

56:14.300 --> 56:16.059
and see if I'm any good at it.
- She doesn't--

56:16.060 --> 56:17.529
- So try it on us.

56:17.530 --> 56:19.129
- Well, no, because
I need to practice.

56:19.130 --> 56:20.729

56:20.730 --> 56:22.259
- Like real life stuff.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.429
"America's Got Talent,"

56:23.430 --> 56:24.529

understand things,

56:24.530 --> 56:26.659
how you misunderstood things,

56:26.660 --> 56:28.799
how you sometimes don't hear--
- But then I just sound like

56:28.800 --> 56:31.429

[laughs]

56:34.431 --> 56:35.859
- So what do you do?

56:35.860 --> 56:38.059
- Besides modeling,
I'm a comedian.

56:38.060 --> 56:39.159
- Oh, is that what
you do on the side?

56:39.160 --> 56:41.699
- Yeah, that's my day job.
- Got it.

56:41.700 --> 56:44.459
- I'm Vicki Barbolak,
I'm sexty--or 60,

56:44.460 --> 56:45.799
as a lot of people say.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.029
I'm from Oceanside, California.

56:48.030 --> 56:50.959
More specifically,
Rancho Calevero trailer park.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.429
[ding]
- How long have you been

56:52.430 --> 56:54.259
doing this comedy thing?
- 20 years.

56:54.260 --> 56:55.959
- 20 years?
- 20 years, yeah.

56:55.960 --> 56:58.529
One day I was, you know,
in the restroom,

56:58.530 --> 57:00.359
and there was some thing
in the trash

57:00.360 --> 57:03.459
and I noticed it and it said
"Stand-up Comedy Classes."

57:03.460 --> 57:05.459
I was, like, 38.

57:05.460 --> 57:08.060
I'm like, hmm,
am I too old to do this?

57:09.960 --> 57:11.759
I've been married three times.

57:11.760 --> 57:13.059
I have two kids.

57:13.060 --> 57:15.299
Since you don't make much
in the stand-up world,

57:15.300 --> 57:17.199
I started
a wedding chapel business

57:17.200 --> 57:19.430
and I became
an ordained minister.

57:20.230 --> 57:21.899
I even have a bed in the back

57:21.900 --> 57:24.629
for a half-hour honeymoon
for an extra $29.95.

57:24.630 --> 57:26.159
- That's show business.
- "America's Got Talent"

57:26.160 --> 57:28.129
could really change my life.

57:28.130 --> 57:31.199
This could take me from my
trailer park in Oceanside

57:31.200 --> 57:33.430
to a trailer park in Malibu.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.929
That cracks me up.
That's so sad.

57:36.930 --> 57:38.859

57:49.430 --> 57:51.429

57:51.430 --> 57:52.859
- What are you gonna
be doing for us today?

57:52.860 --> 57:55.959
- I'm a ballerina.
[laughter]

57:55.960 --> 57:58.159
- Ballerina?
- No, no.

57:58.160 --> 58:00.199
No, I can't--I can't
be a ballerina

58:00.200 --> 58:01.429
'cause I want dinner.

58:01.430 --> 58:02.929
I'm a comedian.
- You're a comedian.

58:02.930 --> 58:06.159
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
[applause]

58:06.160 --> 58:08.459
- You know, comedy, I think,
is one of the hardest things

58:08.460 --> 58:11.599
to do because you have to
entertain a whole entire room

58:11.600 --> 58:14.729
and make us all laugh.
- Is that what's going on here?

58:14.730 --> 58:17.629
Oh, shoot.
- I can't wait to see this.

58:17.630 --> 58:20.259
Good luck.
- All right, thank you.

58:20.260 --> 58:23.330
[cheers and applause]

58:24.830 --> 58:26.229
Heidi, you're looking at me
like you never

58:26.230 --> 58:28.559
saw a trophy wife
in Los Angeles before.

58:28.560 --> 58:31.199
I'm sorry.

58:31.200 --> 58:34.159
I gotta say, yesterday,
I had a lot of nervous energy.

58:34.160 --> 58:37.559
And I decided I'd go out
to Donnelly men's prison

58:37.560 --> 58:39.259
for a conjugal visit.

58:39.260 --> 58:42.929
And, uh, it was, like,
raining--three drops of rain.

58:42.930 --> 58:44.659
You know, in San Diego,
that's like a blizzard.

58:44.660 --> 58:47.529
So it took, like, three hours
to get out to Donnelly

58:47.530 --> 58:49.459
for the conjugal visit.

58:49.460 --> 58:52.559
And I'm not kidding you,
I drive all the way out there

58:52.560 --> 58:57.459
and it turns out at Donnelly,
you have to know somebody.

58:57.460 --> 59:01.229
Is that horrible?

59:01.230 --> 59:02.559
It's ridiculous.

59:02.560 --> 59:03.829
I hated that.

59:03.830 --> 59:05.529
Some things just
don't make sense to me.

59:05.530 --> 59:07.499
like that Elon Musk guy.

59:07.500 --> 59:09.999
He can put a rocket
up in the sky, you know,

59:10.000 --> 59:11.459
and it comes
back down to Earth,

59:11.460 --> 59:13.899
lands on a paper cup, right,

59:13.900 --> 59:16.829
but nobody, nobody
can design a bra

59:16.830 --> 59:19.129
that doesn't feel
like recycle shrapnel.

59:19.130 --> 59:22.199
What's up?
Right, Heidi? Get on that.

59:22.200 --> 59:23.359
[cheers and applause]
- I can.

59:23.360 --> 59:25.559
- Please. I'm gonna try
one of yours.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.699
I need a bra.
It's necessary, right?

59:27.700 --> 59:29.829
When I take my bra off,
my boobs fall down

59:29.830 --> 59:32.359
like a broken mini blind,
I'm serious.

59:32.360 --> 59:34.999
Saggin'.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.429
I mean it.

59:36.430 --> 59:37.559
This has all been
taken care of.

59:37.560 --> 59:38.899
This is all--I'm in therapy.

59:38.900 --> 59:41.859
I'm in therapy. We're good,
we're good.

59:41.860 --> 59:44.259
You know, it's like
a status symbol today.

59:44.260 --> 59:46.359
Like, [imitating] "I'm in
therapy, yeah, therapy.

59:46.360 --> 59:49.259
I have really good insurance."

59:49.260 --> 59:50.999
It was actually
a court order for me.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.360
Okay, so--
I'm not lying.

59:55.360 --> 59:57.399
And you have to be really
careful with therapists.

to find things

"So, Vicki,

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.829
do you ever drink alone?"

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:11.399
No! No way.
Only alcoholics drink alone.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:16.529
Right? I read all those
pamphlets in your office, man.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.399

I started this group because I
want to change people's life.

I want to give them
opportunity.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.059

in Sao Paulo, Brazil

that you have there

who survived.

have no future
