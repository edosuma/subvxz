08:01.100 --> 08:03.005
Look at that guy!

08:03.700 --> 08:05.645
A damn bum!

08:44.860 --> 08:49.565
Hey, you! Are you lost?

08:50.380 --> 08:51.579
Hey!

08:51.580 --> 08:53.125
What the hell?

08:57.740 --> 09:01.805
-Don't you turn your back on me...

09:02.100 --> 09:05.885
English? What the hell?

09:09.540 --> 09:12.125
Ole, stop it!

09:56.340 --> 09:59.499
Ole, stop messing around.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.205
Get up, come on.

10:07.140 --> 10:11.405
-Oh, shit! Ole!
-Call the police!

11:07.420 --> 11:10.219
She said she wanted to do it.

11:10.220 --> 11:14.205
No one's blaming you.
Not the parents, no one.

11:15.300 --> 11:19.659
Everyone speaks highly of you.
Your colleagues, your clients.

11:19.660 --> 11:25.325
Unfortunately these things happen.
Therapy doesn't always help.

11:27.500 --> 11:32.005
You just started out, and that makes
such an experience particularly horrible.

11:38.860 --> 11:43.139
I didn't believe her, Margrethe.
She said everything I needed to know.

11:43.140 --> 11:47.939
<i>-Didn't she have anyone else?
</i>-No one. I could have stopped her.

11:47.940 --> 11:52.299
<i>This isn't your fault.</i>

11:52.300 --> 11:56.165
It was all there for me
to do the right thing. I didn't.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.725
<i>You had no control over her.</i>

12:02.580 --> 12:04.259
Someone's calling.

12:04.260 --> 12:06.619
<i>You should answer that.</i>

12:06.620 --> 12:11.125
<i>Take some time off.
We'll talk tomorrow. Bye.</i>

12:16.180 --> 12:19.005
Hello. It's Christine Aas.

12:46.220 --> 12:47.979
-Hi.
-Henrik. This way.

12:47.980 --> 12:51.419
I have no experience with criminals.
I work mostly with teenagers.

12:51.420 --> 12:56.619
No one expects a miracle. We only
have an hour before the Crime Unit arrives.

12:56.620 --> 12:59.659
I hope we can make him talk
before they take him.

12:59.660 --> 13:03.805
-What's his name?
-Eric Bergland.

13:05.020 --> 13:07.339
Sounds familiar.

13:07.340 --> 13:11.579
The fire in Årdal three years ago.
Five people died.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.619
-It's him?
-Norwegian-American. Backpacker.

13:14.620 --> 13:18.699
-In Norway looking for relatives.
-He's been in the woods all this time?

13:18.700 --> 13:22.205
There are still many questions
regarding that fire.

13:23.660 --> 13:27.059
But now we have three witnesses
saying he killed the boy.

13:27.060 --> 13:31.925
They say he barely touched him,
and he collapsed and died.

13:38.060 --> 13:41.405
-What has he said so far?
-Not a word.

13:43.020 --> 13:49.005
-Any indication why this happened?
-The big question for me is how.

18:40.460 --> 18:44.285
Henrik, let's remove the handcuffs.

18:48.420 --> 18:52.125
Henrik... Ole's parents
are in the reception.

18:53.180 --> 18:56.125
Bjørn refuses to leave
until he has spoken with you.

19:02.380 --> 19:05.445
Remove his handcuffs and stay close.

19:08.220 --> 19:11.125
Therese.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.285
-I can't even begin to...
-Where is he?

19:30.380 --> 19:35.179
I have to see him.
He killed my son. I have a right to...

19:35.180 --> 19:38.579
We're still trying to understand
what really happened.

19:38.580 --> 19:42.219
We know what happened.
The other boys saw the whole thing.

19:42.220 --> 19:47.645
Yes, we have their statements.
Now we have to hear his side.

19:48.460 --> 19:52.605
I just want to look him in the eyes. Once.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.285
I'm sorry, Bjørn.

20:08.940 --> 20:11.699
The Crime Unit is bringing
an American from the embassy.

20:11.700 --> 20:15.805
They want to take him out of the country.

20:16.460 --> 20:20.165
I'll be right outside.

21:22.740 --> 21:27.845
-Hi, I'm from Online News...
-You have no right to be here.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.299
-You have to get out of here!
-No!

23:56.300 --> 24:01.245
He needs help to stop this!
Turn off the alarm!

24:56.220 --> 24:58.365
Are you okay?

25:40.940 --> 25:44.925
-They have no right to do that.
-It's not up to me.

26:24.940 --> 26:27.965
Watch his head.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.205
<i>They are bringing Bergland
to the helicopter now.</i>

26:47.980 --> 26:51.405
You know we'll never understand
what happened in there?

26:52.140 --> 26:54.899
Maybe we're not meant
to understand everything.

26:54.900 --> 26:59.045
I'm thinking God has
a plan with Eric.

27:01.900 --> 27:06.685
Put this behind you.
It's someone else's headache now.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.085
-Give him another dose!

28:38.580 --> 28:42.045
Give him another dose now!

29:07.780 --> 29:10.485
-Do it now!

29:55.180 --> 30:00.085
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Helicopter going down!

30:12.460 --> 30:16.765
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
We're going down!

30:32.020 --> 30:36.405
Get off, get off! Ditch, ditch, ditch!

33:06.780 --> 33:11.219
We found three bodies in the wreckage.
We're bringing them out now.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.445
-Did you find Bergland?
-No, not yet.

33:56.540 --> 33:58.805
Bjørn?

33:59.860 --> 34:05.525
<i>The helicopter was on its way
to Oslo with Bergland...</i>

34:11.179 --> 34:12.899
Where are you going?

34:12.900 --> 34:18.165
<i>The police confirm it is Eric Bergland
they're searching for in Odda.</i>

41:09.940 --> 41:13.845
<i>Are you crazy?
He killed lots of people!</i>

41:15.020 --> 41:16.979
He didn't mean to hurt anyone.

41:16.980 --> 41:20.819
<i>-Christine! He's wanted!
</i>-I know that.

41:20.820 --> 41:24.699
<i>You're helping a criminal!
You could go to prison!</i>

41:24.700 --> 41:30.525
<i>Call the police
and explain what happened.</i>

41:30.700 --> 41:33.565
<i>This could ruin your life!</i>

41:33.620 --> 41:37.419
<i>Please call the police,
then call me when you've done it.</i>

41:37.420 --> 41:39.365
I have to hang up.

41:39.660 --> 41:42.285
<i>Let me know when you've done it?</i>

41:42.460 --> 41:44.219
<i>-Hello?
</i>-Okay.

41:44.220 --> 41:46.845
<i>Good.
Bye.</i>

45:25.860 --> 45:29.819
<i>Locals are still in shock after
yesterday's tragic events -</i>

45:29.820 --> 45:36.005
<i>- that drew international attention
to the small Norwegian town.</i>

46:16.460 --> 46:22.219
<i>Welcome on board MS Askeland.
The crossing will take 15 minutes.</i>

46:22.220 --> 46:27.165
<i>Food and drinks can be bought
in the canteen on the top deck.</i>

47:19.660 --> 47:24.939
<i>The police are asking anyone in Odda who
have seen Eric Bergland to contact them.</i>

47:24.940 --> 47:28.499
<i>He is a suspect
in yesterday's death in Odda.</i>

47:28.500 --> 47:33.299
<i>The police say the public should not
approach him as he may be dangerous.</i>

47:33.300 --> 47:37.805
<i>Bergland may be in the company
of this woman, Christine...</i>

56:21.460 --> 56:23.739
Stop, don't move!

56:23.740 --> 56:26.699
-Don't shoot!
-Get down!

56:26.700 --> 56:30.179
-Don't shoot!

56:30.180 --> 56:33.725
Put your weapons down!

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.419
Help!

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.285
Help! Help!

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.085
We need a doctor! Help me!

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.645
Help me!

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.605
Is he alive?

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.565
I'll get you away from here. Both of you.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.099
This is Henrik Jondal,
the sheriff in Odda.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.859
I have to get Bergland
to the nearest hospital.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.619
I want a confirmation from someone
official that no one will stop us.

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:52.125
If you don't let us through,
you will be held accountable if he dies.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:58.325
<i>One moment. We'll get back to you
with a formal statement.</i>

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:08.725
<i>We will let you through on the condition
that you go straight to Ulvik Hospital.</i>

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:12.525
<i>We will set up a security perimeter
around the hospital.</i>

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.619
You should have told me
your plans.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:28.965
You said there was nothing more
you could do. Why are you helping us now?

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.059
I have believed in God
my whole life.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.445
If this has anything to do with him,
I don't want to be on the wrong side.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:46.019
-Where were you going?
-To the farm.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.539
-That burnt?
-He believes that is where it all started.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:55.379
<i>We're back with an update
from the police station in Hordaland.</i>

01:03:55.380 --> 01:04:00.659
\{\an8}<i>Several police units attended a dramatic
arrest on Hardanger bridge -</i>

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:05.245
\{\an8}<i>- when local extreme weather appeared
to hit the area around the bridge.</i>

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:02.859
<i>Witnesses claim that Eric Bergland
appeared to summon the storm.</i>

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:09.339
<i>In videos taken at the site Bergland
appears to control the lightning.</i>

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.459
<i>Social media are going wild
with speculation.</i>

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:17.445
<i>Several have drawn comparisons
between Bergland and the Norse god Thor.</i>

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.139
<i>The University in Bergen
rejects this claim...</i>

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.419
<i>He was an angry God,
but also a protector of mankind.</i>

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.659
<i>I'm here with Maja Gundersen.
You witnessed...</i>

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.779
<i>He will defeat everyone,
he's Thor!</i>

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.739
<i>Bergland has been sent
to Ulvik Hospital for treatment.</i>

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:41.605
<i>The police and army are securing the
site, the public are urged to keep away.</i>

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:14.485
Ventricular fibrillation!

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.299
What tree? What is he talking about?

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.405
Sometimes he gets these strange visions.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:11.939
<i>People have gathered outside Ulvik
Hospital, hoping to see Eric Bergland.</i>

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.539
<i>The police confirm that they are assisted
by the American government -</i>

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.845
<i>- and the National Guard
to prevent an escalation of the situation.</i>

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:59.725
This looks wrong,
how can he be alive?

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.245
What was that?

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.285
-You have to turn off the machine.
-It won't turn off.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.444
What the hell!

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.005
Is everyone okay?

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.685
The boy in ICU2 has gone into cardiac
arrest. All the defibrillators are dead.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.045
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:43.685
Bjørn!
This is a big mistake!

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:48.605
Please. Don't do this.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:13.565
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.139
No, no.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.605
Let him.

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:57.819
The army is fencing off the farm
to keep the public away.

01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:01.885
And to keep things safe for Eric.
For us all.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.405
Read the page I've marked.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.645
THOR WITH THE HAMMER

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.885
Aft...

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:55.379
It doesn't look that old.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.245
There may have been many houses here
through all these years.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.885
We need help to dig here.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:34.045
<i>Yes. Sierra 2 Charlie
has arrived at the site.</i>

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:39.365
<i>They have requested an excavator
to dig under the fire plot. Over.</i>

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:13.125
Shouldn't we wait
for an archaeologist?

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:20.365
Runestones.

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.885
What is this place?

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:58.739
The knowledge of all the dead gods -

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:02.699
- which Thor's sons collected
after Ragnarok.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.725
They were described as runes.

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:09.605
The Norse gods' own words.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:44.805
Yggdrasil. The World Tree.

01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:50.205
Which shows the nine worlds
of the Norse mythology.

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:26.405
It's time for Eric
to come down here.

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:05.499
<i>They say they've found a chest.</i>

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.805
Did you hear that?
A chest!

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:04.925
<i>The number of casualties following the
tragedy in Årdal is still unconfirmed.</i>

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.645
<i>Norway is still in shock...</i>

01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:18.605
<i>There is still no sign of Eric Bergland.</i>
