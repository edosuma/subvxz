01:10.485 --> 01:11.654
Jasmine?

01:13.488 --> 01:16.291
Jasmine!
We gonna be late, come on.

01:17.026 --> 01:19.292
Let's go.

01:19.294 --> 01:21.463
Why do they have
on these suits and we don't?

01:23.299 --> 01:25.432
Something's going on
right in our face.

01:25.434 --> 01:27.601
You're so stuck
on those iPhones,

01:27.603 --> 01:30.003
J phone 12s or whatever,

01:30.005 --> 01:31.874
blow up in your hand.

01:33.008 --> 01:36.476
You can't Google
what's going on right now.

01:36.478 --> 01:38.514
Are y'all paying attention?

01:39.915 --> 01:44.051
Why do they have on
these suits if we don't?

01:44.053 --> 01:45.421
Why?

01:46.722 --> 01:48.791
They here to clean this water?

01:50.491 --> 01:52.726
When this water been dirtier
than the Devil's mouth

01:52.728 --> 01:54.393
for 50 years.

01:54.395 --> 01:55.464
And now they want to clean it?

01:56.497 --> 01:58.964
They got plans for us, man.

01:58.966 --> 02:01.768
Looking like
George Jetson rejects.

02:01.770 --> 02:03.039
'Cause they weak!

02:03.838 --> 02:05.471
Weak hearts!

02:05.473 --> 02:07.441
Weak lungs!

02:07.443 --> 02:09.979
Can't even breathe up here
without a mask.

02:14.415 --> 02:16.919
But we was put through Hell
to be purified.

02:19.121 --> 02:21.555
You know what I'm sayin',
brothers and sisters?

02:21.557 --> 02:24.524
Man, it's crazy what
jail will do to a nigga.

02:24.526 --> 02:26.525
They don't care
about they water, man,

02:26.527 --> 02:27.793
there's something going on,

02:27.795 --> 02:29.562
we gonna get
to the bottom of it.

02:29.564 --> 02:32.031
And they lucky
I'm a man of God right now.

02:32.033 --> 02:34.033
You think he rehearses this
every morning?

02:34.035 --> 02:36.669
Or they
would catch these hands.

02:36.671 --> 02:39.038
Seems a bit more impromptu.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.906
2019 out here!

02:40.908 --> 02:42.609
We been yellin'
about this water

02:42.611 --> 02:44.414
since before they were born.

02:45.380 --> 02:47.550
Before they were born!

02:49.684 --> 02:52.119
Where's this bus, man?
We're not gonna make it.

02:52.121 --> 02:54.587
Y'all
leave us the hell alone.

02:54.589 --> 02:56.823
Unless y'all really here
to help us.

02:56.825 --> 02:58.557
We'll get there.

02:58.559 --> 03:00.092
They
got plans for us, man.

03:00.094 --> 03:01.595
We're not gonna make it, bro.

03:01.597 --> 03:02.829
Not for you and me.

03:02.831 --> 03:03.964
So I urge you!

03:03.966 --> 03:06.002
Fight for your land!

03:06.801 --> 03:09.502
Fight for your home!

03:09.504 --> 03:12.508
- Fight for your...
- Let's skate.

03:24.753 --> 03:25.922
<i>This here?</i>

03:26.889 --> 03:29.889
<i>This is the edge, bro!</i>

03:29.891 --> 03:33.894
<i>The final frontier
of Manifest Destiny.</i>

03:33.896 --> 03:35.464
<i>Last edge of the city.</i>

03:36.998 --> 03:38.632
<i>Man, two steps further,</i>

03:38.634 --> 03:40.903
<i>you'll be drinking
that filthy saltwater.</i>

03:42.837 --> 03:44.937
<i>But we built these ships.</i>

03:44.939 --> 03:47.073
<i>Dredged these canals.</i>

03:47.075 --> 03:50.580
<i>In the San Francisco
they never knew existed.</i>

03:59.855 --> 04:03.159
<i>And now they come
to build something new?</i>

04:05.493 --> 04:09.966
<i>Whole blocks half in the past,
half in the future.</i>

04:12.099 --> 04:15.936
<i>But should you venture
into their San Francisco,</i>

04:15.938 --> 04:18.140
<i>the one they pillaged
for gold!</i>

04:19.173 --> 04:21.708
<i>Remember your truth!</i>

04:21.709 --> 04:23.813
<i>In the city of facades.</i>

05:15.162 --> 05:16.595
Take me with you!

05:16.597 --> 05:18.564
Hey! Hey!

05:18.566 --> 05:20.599
Take me with you, man!

05:20.601 --> 05:21.934
Come on, where are we going?

05:21.936 --> 05:25.772
Where are we going?

05:25.774 --> 05:28.211
Come on, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

05:34.815 --> 05:37.284
<i>Look
at them look at you.</i>

05:37.286 --> 05:39.121
<i>Look down at you.</i>

05:40.022 --> 05:41.824
<i>But we built them!</i>

05:42.758 --> 05:44.760
<i>We are these homes!</i>

05:45.260 --> 05:46.896
<i>Their eyes...</i>

05:48.563 --> 05:50.565
<i>Their pointed brims...</i>

05:51.967 --> 05:54.103
<i>We move if they move.</i>

05:56.837 --> 05:59.541
<i>Our sweat soaked in the wood.</i>

06:01.310 --> 06:03.613
<i>Gilded in our image.</i>

06:07.748 --> 06:09.719
<i>This is our home!</i>

06:11.053 --> 06:12.722
<i>Our home!</i>

06:15.690 --> 06:17.226
<i>Our home.</i>

06:21.762 --> 06:22.931
Thanks.

06:27.269 --> 06:28.871
Are you sure they're gone?

06:42.984 --> 06:44.751
Jim?

06:44.753 --> 06:46.322
I mean,
their car is gone.

06:48.089 --> 06:50.657
Let's check the back, man.

06:50.659 --> 06:51.758
Good morning.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.928
How are you?

06:55.796 --> 06:57.198
Remember that time
they were in the kitchen?

06:58.967 --> 07:00.135
Jim!

07:01.102 --> 07:02.604
Remember the kitchen?

07:03.804 --> 07:05.073
Yeah, sure.

07:06.741 --> 07:07.909
But, bruh...

07:08.876 --> 07:10.210
Didn't I tell you

07:10.212 --> 07:12.281
these railings are
periwinkle, not black.

07:15.150 --> 07:16.284
Mmm-hmm.

07:17.351 --> 07:18.721
Yeah, I got it.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.190
We gotta start coming more
than every two weeks, bro.

07:27.996 --> 07:30.330
This fuckin' garden's
a nightmare.

07:30.332 --> 07:32.898
I'll bring my grandpa's
tools next time.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.102
Please do.

07:46.313 --> 07:48.116
Wallpaper's chipping.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.886
These people
are killing this house.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.921
You're not
goin' in though.

07:54.923 --> 07:55.992
Jim?

07:57.125 --> 07:58.661
I mean...

07:59.895 --> 08:01.361
I mean...

08:01.363 --> 08:02.632
No?

08:05.267 --> 08:07.434
They're definitely
gone, though.

08:07.436 --> 08:10.003
Better be quick
this time. Hmm?

08:10.005 --> 08:11.040
Yeah, I know.

08:11.707 --> 08:12.908
Takes time.

08:13.741 --> 08:15.174
Yeah, I know.

08:15.176 --> 08:17.010
I'll be
at my spot.

08:17.012 --> 08:18.113
All right.

08:20.382 --> 08:22.114
Quick.

08:22.116 --> 08:23.184
Okay.

08:55.917 --> 08:57.750
- Jesus, man!
- Honey.

08:57.752 --> 08:59.451
Just get the heck
out of here, man.

08:59.453 --> 09:01.220
- What the fuck?
- He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

09:01.222 --> 09:02.455
Oh, he's painting
the house now?

09:02.457 --> 09:03.523
Well, yeah.

09:03.525 --> 09:06.125
Stop fixing my house!

09:06.127 --> 09:08.228
I'm almost done,
just hold on.

09:08.230 --> 09:10.497
Why don't you just
paint the neighbors' houses?

09:10.499 --> 09:12.132
Theirs are worse
than ours.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.867
Just hold on one second.

09:13.869 --> 09:15.167
I mean,
we appreciate it,

09:15.169 --> 09:17.036
in some way, but, yeah...

09:17.038 --> 09:18.104
It's weird, man!

09:18.106 --> 09:20.306
I'm almost done.

09:20.308 --> 09:22.274
Look, we will
call the cops, man.

09:22.276 --> 09:23.777
And I mean it this time.

09:23.779 --> 09:25.979
No, we're not
gonna call the cops.

09:25.981 --> 09:28.314
We're not calling the cops,
just stop coming back.

09:28.316 --> 09:31.117
I'm almost done, hold on,
please, hold on.

09:31.119 --> 09:34.019
Ugh! Just get off
my fucking birdie bath.

09:34.021 --> 09:35.821
No, just...

09:35.823 --> 09:37.023
Get outta here, man.

09:37.025 --> 09:38.827
- Those were $3.
- Fine.

09:39.528 --> 09:41.027
I'll finish it next time.

09:41.029 --> 09:42.461
- God!
- Next time?

09:42.463 --> 09:43.930
Oh, just get...

09:43.932 --> 09:45.398
Get the heck off
my birdie bath!

09:45.400 --> 09:47.202
Just water the plants
in the back or I will.

09:47.836 --> 09:49.502
Oh!

09:49.504 --> 09:51.937
Bro!
You were supposed to be the lookout!

09:51.939 --> 09:53.273
Mmm-hmm.

09:53.275 --> 09:54.840
You were the one
that was so worried.

09:54.842 --> 09:56.212
I got distracted.

09:57.545 --> 09:59.278
Bro!

09:59.280 --> 10:01.480
What if OG
is right though?

10:01.482 --> 10:04.050
You really gotta stop
eating the fish out there.

10:04.052 --> 10:05.585
I think it's fine.

10:05.587 --> 10:07.954
All fish has mercury.

10:07.956 --> 10:12.992
I know, but I saw a
seagull with a dick, bro.

10:12.994 --> 10:15.527
Well, so I guess
it's a male.

10:15.529 --> 10:18.433
No, like, bro,
like a human dick.

10:21.068 --> 10:23.869
Oh, nasty-ass
tumbleweave. Pussy.

10:23.871 --> 10:25.271
- Wild, bro.
- Wassup, nigga?

10:25.273 --> 10:26.572
- Ain't tryin' do nothin'.
- Scuff my shoes up, huh?

10:26.574 --> 10:28.207
I ain't tryin'
do that bullshit...

10:28.209 --> 10:29.508
Stop playin' before I slap
the shit out your face.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.009
Man, shut your ass up, nigga.

10:31.011 --> 10:32.177
All right,
I ain't finna chase you,

10:32.179 --> 10:33.546
you play too much, bro.

10:33.548 --> 10:36.014
You lucky I don't beat
your ass out here, bro.

10:36.016 --> 10:37.483
Kofi!

10:37.485 --> 10:39.152
- What's good, brother?
- What's up with y'all?

10:39.154 --> 10:41.019
Hey, you know I seen
Moms last night, right?

10:41.021 --> 10:42.287
She was looking
like she was

10:42.289 --> 10:44.356
missing a little bit
on the top.

10:44.358 --> 10:46.960
I mean we shower in the same
water, Jim.

10:53.068 --> 10:55.804
So niggas takin' showers
together now?

10:57.105 --> 10:58.440
Probably was.

10:59.506 --> 11:01.109
That's fruity.

11:02.910 --> 11:05.244
I was trying to tell
him not to eat the fish,

11:05.246 --> 11:06.979
because the water
is toxic.

11:06.981 --> 11:08.413
Well, duh.

11:08.415 --> 11:10.516
That's 'cause they built
the atomic bomb

11:10.518 --> 11:11.887
right there, nigga.

11:23.932 --> 11:26.034
I don't think
that's true.

11:26.967 --> 11:28.234
What'd he say?

11:28.236 --> 11:29.502
- Damn.
- First thing, that's true.

11:29.504 --> 11:30.936
Bro, them shoes
ain't true,

11:30.938 --> 11:32.272
I know your
Jesus-lookin' ass

11:32.274 --> 11:33.940
ain't talkin',
bro.

11:33.942 --> 11:35.642
- Them things is phony.
- They're definitely phony.

11:35.644 --> 11:37.243
What about
cuz, man?

11:37.245 --> 11:38.945
You was supposed to
call me last night.

11:38.947 --> 11:40.479
- What happened with...
- Oh, yeah, dude is a cat.

11:40.481 --> 11:41.580
You see his hair,
he might be a cheetah.

11:47.322 --> 11:48.988
<i>Can I help you?</i>

11:48.990 --> 11:50.058
<i>I'd like to see
the man in charge.</i>

11:50.558 --> 11:52.024
<i>In here.</i>

11:52.026 --> 11:53.558
He's walking him
into the Chief's office.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.363
Oh, dear.

11:57.665 --> 11:59.666
<i>I want to report
a murder.</i>

11:59.668 --> 12:01.537
- <i>Sit down.</i>
- Now, who's that?

12:02.603 --> 12:04.336
Edgar O'Ryan.

12:04.338 --> 12:05.939
<i>Where was
this murder committed?</i>

12:05.941 --> 12:07.606
- Edmund O'Brien.
- <i>San Francisco.</i>

12:07.608 --> 12:10.109
Oh. Oh, him,
yeah, yeah.

12:10.111 --> 12:11.279
<i>Who was murdered?</i>

12:13.615 --> 12:14.917
<i>I was.</i>

12:19.553 --> 12:21.287
What?

12:21.289 --> 12:23.623
- How?
- Just watch it.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.628
<i>I don't have
very much time.</i>

12:27.227 --> 12:29.162
Hey, hand me
my beer, son.

12:29.164 --> 12:30.665
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

12:31.399 --> 12:33.231
Yeah, okay.

12:33.233 --> 12:35.734
O'Brien is smoking
a cigarette

12:35.736 --> 12:39.104
- in his office.
- Okay, yeah.

12:39.106 --> 12:42.477
- Secretary's perched.
- She pretty?

12:43.577 --> 12:45.378
Mmm...

12:45.380 --> 12:47.283
- Yeah?
- I'd say... I'd say she is.

12:50.418 --> 12:51.651
You dog.

12:54.389 --> 12:55.557
Hey, Mont!

12:56.991 --> 12:59.091
- Montgomery!
- Mmm?

12:59.093 --> 13:01.293
How do I get their old
croissant-throwing asses

13:01.295 --> 13:02.363
out of the house?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.001
What if I peed
on their table?

13:09.504 --> 13:12.341
Like, what if I climbed up
the birdie bath,

13:13.174 --> 13:14.574
broke in and just peed

13:14.576 --> 13:16.378
all over that stupid
little yellow table?

13:18.045 --> 13:20.348
Wouldn't that
ruin the floors?

13:22.350 --> 13:24.486
Yeah, I guess
you got a point there.

13:26.453 --> 13:27.522
Oh.

13:38.332 --> 13:41.367
You think they'd let me
live there as, like,

13:41.369 --> 13:43.672
a caretaker
for the house?

13:47.509 --> 13:49.108
No.

13:50.779 --> 13:52.448
That's fucked up.

13:54.783 --> 13:56.615
I mean, I take pretty
good care of the house,

13:56.617 --> 13:58.417
I think so at least.

13:58.419 --> 13:59.755
Yeah, you do.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.258
We like having
you here, Jim.

14:03.725 --> 14:05.094
I know, bro.

14:06.727 --> 14:09.162
But...

14:09.164 --> 14:11.433
You know
there's no place like home.

14:14.135 --> 14:15.303

Sir.

15:49.197 --> 15:51.433
Yeah.

16:00.507 --> 16:01.642
All right?

16:02.409 --> 16:03.776
Small guy.

16:03.778 --> 16:05.147
He's perfect.

16:09.616 --> 16:11.687
Hey, you get any writing
done this morning?

16:12.953 --> 16:14.222
Um...

16:15.557 --> 16:17.359
Writing is rewriting.

16:19.961 --> 16:21.663
It's all part
of the process.

16:23.898 --> 16:25.500
Yeah, you got it, though.

16:27.202 --> 16:29.270
Hmm... Yeah, man.

16:50.390 --> 16:51.726
What the f...

16:58.765 --> 17:00.800
Y'all been here 12 years,

17:00.802 --> 17:02.837
still can't take care
of this house.

17:14.415 --> 17:15.517
Hey, Paul.

17:15.983 --> 17:17.785
Hey!

17:19.887 --> 17:20.955
I got you.

17:23.023 --> 17:25.625
- Hi.
- Eat your banana.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.759
- Fuck you.
- Hey.

17:28.896 --> 17:30.763
You're a nice man.

17:32.367 --> 17:33.898
You're a nice woman.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.736
But I don't know you.

17:40.742 --> 17:42.574
Well, yeah.

17:42.576 --> 17:44.679
You know me
pretty well, actually.

17:45.846 --> 17:49.314
But you aren't
my husband.

17:49.316 --> 17:52.318
You're a
little too young for me.

17:56.056 --> 17:57.659
I am young.

17:58.926 --> 18:00.928
I'm always young.

18:03.331 --> 18:05.330
You're a nice man.

18:05.332 --> 18:07.535
Oh, thank you.

18:08.335 --> 18:09.834
You're a nice woman.

18:09.836 --> 18:13.039
You old marshmallow,
cream puff ass,

18:13.041 --> 18:16.074
candied yam-ass nigga,
cream puff-ass nigga.

18:17.378 --> 18:18.476
Shut up, bitch, bro.

18:18.478 --> 18:20.045
- You bitch.
- Hold this shit.

18:20.047 --> 18:21.981
I should snatch
your one-ass dread,

18:21.983 --> 18:24.617
lookin' like
a fuckin' Rastafarian sperm.

18:28.956 --> 18:30.455
You got me fucked up.

18:30.457 --> 18:31.823
- We got you fucked up!
- We did!

18:31.825 --> 18:33.391
That's all you gotta say?

18:33.393 --> 18:34.726
Man, what I'm supposed
to do, take off?

18:34.728 --> 18:36.395
I don't care
about none of that shit.

18:36.397 --> 18:37.929
I know, I just ain't
got nothin' else to say.

18:37.931 --> 18:39.398
Man, I put that
on a fact,

18:39.400 --> 18:40.800
that this nigga's
a bitch, man.

18:40.802 --> 18:41.469
- Is that sure, man.
- Man, fuck this nigga.

18:50.445 --> 18:51.746
'Sup, nigga?

18:57.118 --> 18:58.520
'Sup, nigga?

19:03.091 --> 19:04.693
How are you, nigga?

19:41.528 --> 19:43.495
I hope she's not home.

19:43.497 --> 19:44.929
That garden...

19:44.931 --> 19:47.399
We have so much to do.

19:47.401 --> 19:48.734
We have to rake it.

19:48.736 --> 19:50.002
We have to weed it.

19:50.004 --> 19:51.340
- We have to...
- Jim.

19:53.006 --> 19:55.140
Isn't that the car
you used to live in?

19:55.142 --> 19:56.841
Oh, God.

19:56.843 --> 19:59.145
Jimmie!

19:59.147 --> 20:01.850
What up,
filth-smellin' motherfucker?

20:04.552 --> 20:05.684
Do you need a ride?

20:12.526 --> 20:13.993
Jimmie!

20:13.995 --> 20:15.994
What's happenin', baby?

20:15.996 --> 20:18.997
Get your young,
old-looking ass in the car.

20:18.999 --> 20:20.733
Daddy face.

20:20.735 --> 20:21.966
Jimmie!

20:21.968 --> 20:24.570
Oh, my God,
where is this bus?

20:24.572 --> 20:27.705
Man, if you don't get your up the
father from <i>Good Times</i> shirt-wearing ass

20:27.707 --> 20:28.709
in this car...

20:30.445 --> 20:32.744
You really gonna ride
in the bus with a shovel?

20:32.746 --> 20:35.947
Get your farming ass
in this car.

20:35.949 --> 20:38.484
Jimmie the farmer
with your bitch ass.

20:44.225 --> 20:46.962
Come on, laugh a little bit,
Jimmie, shit.

20:47.894 --> 20:49.594
Still the same.

20:49.596 --> 20:52.566
Yep, I like what you
and your dad did with it.

20:53.734 --> 20:55.834
So much
you drove off with it?

20:55.836 --> 20:57.936
No, I borrowed it, I
didn't, just, come on...

20:57.938 --> 21:01.506
I drove off with it...
I borrowed it, shit.

21:01.508 --> 21:03.908
Matter of fact,
I seen your dad the other day.

21:03.910 --> 21:05.844
He was good and lonely.

21:05.846 --> 21:07.181
By hisself.

21:08.649 --> 21:10.081
Okay.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.952
I told him you need to
get you a cat or a dog,

21:12.954 --> 21:14.823
or woman or something,
nigga, damn.

21:15.590 --> 21:17.490
He's home alone...

21:17.492 --> 21:20.091
Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

21:20.093 --> 21:22.528
He's alone with no home.

21:25.699 --> 21:27.933
Well, you live in a car
by yourself.

21:27.935 --> 21:30.836
Yeah, but I...
But I'm not alone.

21:30.838 --> 21:32.541
People like me.

21:33.107 --> 21:34.609
I'm liked.

21:35.243 --> 21:37.546
Lonely ass nigga.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.817
When the last time you
hung out with your daddy?

21:48.555 --> 21:50.222
Couple weeks ago,
I dunno.

21:50.224 --> 21:53.028
Couple weeks ago?
The nigga needs you today.

21:53.727 --> 21:55.593
Shit.

21:55.595 --> 21:58.129
That's what... That's what
people have kids for,

21:58.131 --> 22:00.599
so they can have
some companionship!

22:00.601 --> 22:02.667
Somebody to hang out with.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.637
That's why
I ain't had no kids.

22:04.639 --> 22:06.839
'Cause I don't wanna
be bothered.

22:06.841 --> 22:08.773
Your daddy don't want
this fuckin' car, man.

22:08.775 --> 22:10.309
- Hey.
- Hmm?

22:10.311 --> 22:12.711
Wasn't that
the Savoy House?

22:12.713 --> 22:14.746
Oh, sure was.

22:14.748 --> 22:18.553
It was 100 motherfuckers
in there, rent-controlled.

22:20.053 --> 22:22.189
They thought
they owned that shit.

22:23.791 --> 22:27.091
The landlord burned all
of the people outta there.

22:27.093 --> 22:28.927
'Cause see, Jimmie,

22:28.929 --> 22:30.798
you never really
own shit.

22:31.966 --> 22:34.198
This car ain't mine.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.072
But it never was yours.

22:43.244 --> 22:46.147
You never own shit!

22:53.853 --> 22:55.253
What the fuck?

23:08.134 --> 23:09.767
Hey, what's goin' on, man?

23:09.769 --> 23:11.171
<i>No se,</i> bro.

23:19.947 --> 23:21.116
Uh, sir...

23:22.350 --> 23:23.983
What's...
What's going on?

23:23.985 --> 23:25.320
Oh, God.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.023
She's moving.

23:29.156 --> 23:31.790
Fighting like crazy
with her sister.

23:31.792 --> 23:33.993
When someone
dies in the family,

23:33.995 --> 23:35.994
that's what
white people do.

23:35.996 --> 23:39.365
This is for her,
this is for him, this is mine.

23:39.367 --> 23:41.065
Who's gonna
have the house?

23:41.067 --> 23:43.101
So they lost the house?

23:43.103 --> 23:45.140
Who's gonna
possess the house?

23:46.373 --> 23:50.178
They're just fighting,
and fighting, and fighting.

24:01.354 --> 24:03.357
What's gonna happen
to it now?

24:12.265 --> 24:15.102
Why'd they have to move
out 'cause her mom died?

24:16.937 --> 24:18.238
I don't know.

24:18.973 --> 24:21.439
They were tasteless,

24:21.441 --> 24:23.975
but at least
they didn't fuck it up.

24:23.977 --> 24:26.445
Well, that will be
$10, hun.

24:26.447 --> 24:28.147
Since when?

24:28.149 --> 24:31.015
Since that's the best deal
you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

24:31.017 --> 24:33.851
I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie.
I said 16.

24:33.853 --> 24:35.856
How I'm gonna
eat 60 Twix?

24:36.457 --> 24:38.322
I don't know your life.

24:38.324 --> 24:40.693
You act like you in
Costco or something like that.

24:40.695 --> 24:42.226
You ain't Costco.

24:42.228 --> 24:44.263
Hey, you can go
to Costco if you need to.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.264
- You Rosco.
- Go right now.

24:46.266 --> 24:47.899
Sixteen, first time you had a
check, when I was 16.

24:47.901 --> 24:50.270
<i>Jim. Jim.</i>

24:52.273 --> 24:53.375
Jim.

24:54.909 --> 24:56.340
Jim?

24:56.342 --> 24:57.879
So, gentlemen.

25:00.214 --> 25:01.683
What can I do for you?

25:02.917 --> 25:05.050
Yeah, we're curious
about a house

25:05.052 --> 25:07.753
on Golden Gate
near Fillmore.

25:07.755 --> 25:10.321
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's 959.

25:10.323 --> 25:13.358
It's the gray,
it's got the gold trim.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.461
- Uh...
- Yup, yup.

25:15.463 --> 25:18.129
Yup, with the, um...

25:18.131 --> 25:19.333
The witch hat.

25:21.067 --> 25:22.201
Yeah, exactly.

25:22.203 --> 25:23.936
Yeah!

25:23.938 --> 25:25.270
I know exactly
what you're talking about,

25:25.272 --> 25:27.106
- that place is very special.
- Hmm.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.506
I used to drive
past that house

25:28.508 --> 25:30.141
on the way
to school every day.

25:30.143 --> 25:32.010
What school
did you go to?

25:32.012 --> 25:33.811
I went to St. Ignatius.

25:33.813 --> 25:35.414
You from here, too?

25:35.416 --> 25:37.448
Yeah, third generation,
I went to Reardon, actually.

25:37.450 --> 25:39.184
- Really?
- Yeah,

25:39.186 --> 25:40.886
we used to play y'all
in football all the time.

25:40.888 --> 25:41.954
Fuck you,
you used to kill us in football.

25:41.956 --> 25:43.054
Yeah, yeah.

25:43.056 --> 25:44.089
I didn't wanna
say that, but...

25:44.091 --> 25:46.457
That's awesome, right on.

25:46.459 --> 25:48.994
But, so, it's for sale?
I didn't hear about that.

25:48.996 --> 25:50.896
Well, I'm not sure.

25:50.898 --> 25:52.865
It seems like the owner
and her sister

25:52.867 --> 25:54.198
are fighting over it.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.303
But I guess
her mom died.

25:57.537 --> 25:59.772
Ah, man.

25:59.774 --> 26:02.273
I don't know, that sounds
like an estate thing.

26:02.275 --> 26:04.746
That's a sucky situation.

26:05.513 --> 26:07.245
But, I mean...

26:07.247 --> 26:08.880
With a house like that,

26:08.882 --> 26:10.985
they could be fighting
over that for years.

26:11.552 --> 26:13.154
While it just sits there.

26:14.121 --> 26:16.187
It's a pity.

26:16.189 --> 26:19.457
So it's really just...
Just empty?

26:19.459 --> 26:20.958
It's fucked up, right?

26:20.960 --> 26:22.528
So fucked up, like I...

26:22.530 --> 26:24.996
Bothers me, there's all
these people in the street

26:24.998 --> 26:26.365
and these big old houses

26:26.367 --> 26:28.801
are just sitting there
collecting dust.

26:28.803 --> 26:31.803
But shit,
what else can you say?

26:31.805 --> 26:35.075
The fucking injustice of it!

26:37.111 --> 26:38.278
Yeah.

27:51.317 --> 27:53.017
Mont! We here, baby!

28:17.911 --> 28:19.511
Spoiling all the fun,

28:19.513 --> 28:22.214
leveling most
of this neighborhood

28:22.216 --> 28:24.616
in the name of Urban Renewal.

28:24.618 --> 28:27.985
Sorry about your homes
and your funky shops.

28:27.987 --> 28:30.022
You can set up
a shoeshine stand

28:30.024 --> 28:32.456
in front of the parking lot
at Safeway.

28:32.458 --> 28:34.959
But you distinguished
truth-seekers

28:34.961 --> 28:38.163
want to know about the real
hep cats who hung out here,

28:38.165 --> 28:40.532
in the "Harlem of the West,"

28:40.534 --> 28:44.403
where a few of these homes
did survive.

28:44.405 --> 28:46.271
Like this beauty here,

28:46.273 --> 28:49.573
which was built
clear back in the 1800s.

28:49.575 --> 28:51.310
Before the black thing,

28:51.312 --> 28:54.245
this was all Japanese,

28:54.247 --> 28:57.983
till FDR's stormtroopers
rounded them up into camps.

28:57.985 --> 29:00.985
This house was built
in the 1940s.

29:03.056 --> 29:05.090
Say hi to our neighbor
here, everybody.

29:05.092 --> 29:06.992
Hi.

29:06.994 --> 29:10.661
That would actually be about
100 years late for this style.

29:10.663 --> 29:13.365
We can see
from his gingerbread trim,

29:13.367 --> 29:17.336
this was built
sometime in the 1850s.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.638
Uh, 1946!

29:19.640 --> 29:23.574
I'm gonna have to disagree
with you there, dude man.

29:23.576 --> 29:28.045
No architect in the 1940s
was building in this style.

29:28.047 --> 29:31.986
That's probably true,
but this wasn't built by an architect.

29:32.686 --> 29:34.554
My grandfather built this.

29:37.224 --> 29:40.157
He came here World War II,

29:40.159 --> 29:42.964
he bought this lot
and he built this house.

29:44.163 --> 29:45.563
The stairs.

29:45.565 --> 29:47.398
These windows.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.470
The columns. The archways.

29:51.237 --> 29:52.239
The witch hat.

29:53.172 --> 29:54.508
The balustrades.

29:55.309 --> 29:56.511
The fish scales.

29:57.143 --> 29:59.511
This balcony.

29:59.513 --> 30:02.050
That wall to keep
y'all the fuck out.

30:03.417 --> 30:04.953
All of it.

30:06.253 --> 30:09.687
By Jimmie Fails I,
with his own two hands.

30:09.689 --> 30:11.558
In 1946.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.529
Wow.

30:16.030 --> 30:18.132
That's pretty amazing.

30:18.798 --> 30:20.000
Well...

30:20.767 --> 30:23.068
Let's move on
to our next stop.

30:23.070 --> 30:25.070
The closet Patty Hearst

30:25.072 --> 30:28.372
willfully hid herself in,
before trotting on down...

30:28.374 --> 30:31.011
What's good with that?
What's going on?

30:32.478 --> 30:34.245
Feel like
the King of England.

30:34.247 --> 30:36.048
King Jimmie. Wave.

30:36.050 --> 30:37.385
Wave to the General.

30:39.285 --> 30:41.253
- Hey, General.
- Yeah, but it's like a circle,

30:41.255 --> 30:43.455
with your...
With your elbow.

30:43.457 --> 30:45.223
Yeah, and then
cup the air.

30:45.225 --> 30:46.425
That's kind of
the thing there.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.096
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, that's good.

31:30.536 --> 31:32.406
It's a beautiful house,
Jimmie.

31:35.409 --> 31:37.745
More beautiful than
I could have imagined.

31:38.812 --> 31:40.180
Yeah.

31:41.448 --> 31:43.618
It's not quite
there yet.

31:57.197 --> 31:59.833
I mean, enough Dickens.

32:00.667 --> 32:01.832
Charles Dickens.

32:01.834 --> 32:03.601
Philistines, bro.

32:03.603 --> 32:05.137
Proust!

32:05.139 --> 32:06.905
Plath!

32:06.907 --> 32:08.273
Hughes!

32:08.275 --> 32:11.342
Jimmie! Langston Hughes!

32:11.344 --> 32:12.679
They left him!

32:13.880 --> 32:15.248
Bro!

32:17.884 --> 32:19.553
Philistines!

32:30.464 --> 32:31.631
Mont.

32:33.699 --> 32:34.869
Mont.

32:36.469 --> 32:38.338
Wake up.

32:44.544 --> 32:45.712
Got a plan.

33:08.302 --> 33:10.267
It's crazy.

33:10.269 --> 33:12.305
Last time I was here,
these weeds was taller than me.

33:14.908 --> 33:16.574
She's expecting us?

33:16.576 --> 33:17.911
Yes, sir.

33:30.890 --> 33:32.657
- Auntie!
- Jimmie!

33:33.826 --> 33:35.526
Yes!

33:35.528 --> 33:38.295
Oh! So good
to see you!

33:38.297 --> 33:39.763
- You look good!
- Thank you.

33:39.765 --> 33:41.499
- Hey!
- This is Mont.

33:41.501 --> 33:44.569
Nice to meet you.
Oh.

33:44.571 --> 33:46.437
Y'all not hot?
Like, you want...

33:46.439 --> 33:47.938
- It's hot as hell out here.
- Take your jacket off.

33:47.940 --> 33:49.974
Ain't nobody gonna
steal your jacket.

33:49.976 --> 33:52.780
This is a nice neighborhood.

33:55.349 --> 33:57.549
Man, he better not
break my damn board.

33:57.551 --> 33:58.849
Shut up.

33:58.851 --> 34:00.851
You should be
thanking him.

34:00.853 --> 34:03.457
He's the one that helped
me pick out that board.

34:05.025 --> 34:07.425
And besides...

34:07.427 --> 34:09.295
Sometimes it's just

34:10.264 --> 34:11.931
nice to watch.

34:13.565 --> 34:14.735
Mmm.

34:17.436 --> 34:19.606
Ricky, do that trick
you used to do, baby.

34:22.641 --> 34:23.976
Nice, baby.

34:25.311 --> 34:27.445
Y'all hella cute.

34:27.447 --> 34:29.315
Aw, thank you.

34:30.684 --> 34:32.315
So,

34:32.318 --> 34:34.286
how much of this stuff
do you still have?

34:34.719 --> 34:36.553
Really?

34:36.554 --> 34:38.889
How much
of this stuff do you have?

34:38.891 --> 34:40.891
You just,
no segue or nothin'?

34:40.893 --> 34:42.726
You just came to see
the stuff, huh?

34:42.728 --> 34:43.893
Auntie...

34:43.896 --> 34:45.565
I got my first place.

34:47.632 --> 34:48.802
Whoa.

34:49.702 --> 34:50.804
Really?

34:51.570 --> 34:52.670
In the city?

34:52.672 --> 34:54.071
In the city.

34:54.072 --> 34:55.873
Look at you!

34:55.876 --> 34:58.709
Y'all must be doing pretty
well to afford a spot there.

34:58.711 --> 35:00.514
Yeah, we got lucky.

35:01.947 --> 35:04.851
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's super empty, though.

35:08.622 --> 35:10.591
Your daddy didn't
send you here, right?

35:11.358 --> 35:12.756
- No.
- You sure?

35:12.758 --> 35:13.760
I swear to God.

35:17.064 --> 35:18.495
'Cause I hope he's done

35:18.497 --> 35:20.434
dragging you
into his schemes.

35:21.367 --> 35:23.803
Auntie, this is for us.

35:27.974 --> 35:29.043
Okay.

35:30.477 --> 35:31.943
Okay.

35:34.113 --> 35:36.113
I'm proud of you, Jayboe.

35:36.115 --> 35:38.850
- Really am.
- Thank you.

35:38.852 --> 35:40.454
I miss that city.

35:41.954 --> 35:44.455
Oh! Ooh!

35:44.457 --> 35:46.557
You still look good
though, baby.

35:46.559 --> 35:49.126
You still look good!

35:49.128 --> 35:50.397
Mmm.

35:51.398 --> 35:53.398
Oh, my goodness.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.466
Mmm.

36:00.639 --> 36:03.807
Damn, I knew you had some of
it, but is this everything?

36:03.809 --> 36:06.945
Everything your dad
didn't smoke up.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.580
Sorry, came out
a little harsh.

36:09.582 --> 36:10.651
I'm fine.

36:18.392 --> 36:20.394
You really got
all of this.

36:20.927 --> 36:22.095
Yep!

36:23.662 --> 36:25.666
Got as much as I could.

36:36.108 --> 36:37.477
Open that.

36:41.548 --> 36:43.113
That's amazing.

36:43.115 --> 36:44.816
Yeah, I knew that,

36:44.818 --> 36:46.517
out of everybody
in this family,

36:46.519 --> 36:48.922
you would be the one that
come looking for this stuff.

36:50.423 --> 36:51.592
So...

36:53.492 --> 36:54.892
I can...

36:54.894 --> 36:56.063
Everything?

36:58.197 --> 36:59.898
It's yours.

36:59.900 --> 37:02.066
- Thank you.
- Hell, yeah.

37:02.068 --> 37:03.437
Ricky, get the truck!

37:06.506 --> 37:07.842
You guys good back there?

37:32.064 --> 37:33.131
Bye.

37:33.133 --> 37:34.535
Thank you.

37:36.035 --> 37:38.169
So, Ricky never lived
in the house?

37:38.171 --> 37:41.705
No, Wanda didn't meet him
until after we lost it.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.588
- Hello, sir.
- Hey!

37:57.590 --> 37:59.490
I'm Jimmie Fails, we haven't
had the chance to meet yet.

37:59.492 --> 38:00.960
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

38:01.894 --> 38:03.528
Welcome to the neighborhood.

38:03.530 --> 38:05.129
Yeah, oh, yes...

38:05.131 --> 38:06.664
Welcome.

38:06.666 --> 38:08.233
Tim! Tim Ellory.

38:08.235 --> 38:09.800
Sure, sure,
nice to meet you, man.

38:09.802 --> 38:11.602
It's a fast-moving market,

38:11.604 --> 38:13.771
I don't even remember
a sign going up.

38:13.773 --> 38:16.240
Oh, it didn't
need to, but...

38:16.242 --> 38:18.876
Look, Tim,
I want you to know

38:18.878 --> 38:21.548
I'm going to be the best
damn neighbor you ever had.

38:22.782 --> 38:24.182
Well...

38:24.184 --> 38:27.519
- All right, Jimmie, thank you.
- My pleasure.

38:27.521 --> 38:29.954
Uh, well,
you'll have to pardon me,

38:29.956 --> 38:32.090
we've got
lots to do, but...

38:32.092 --> 38:34.628
- Of course, oh, yeah.
- Very nice to meet you, yeah.

38:42.535 --> 38:45.102
What the fuck
was that all about?

39:06.626 --> 39:08.059
I wanna drink my coffee

39:08.061 --> 39:10.597
and scratch my ass
while I read the paper.

39:12.197 --> 39:14.067
You don't read
the paper, Jimmie.

39:16.669 --> 39:18.838
'Cause I never had
a home to read it in.

39:21.675 --> 39:22.709
Shit.

39:24.276 --> 39:25.945
We could throw parties.

39:30.849 --> 39:32.085
You could put on
one of your plays.

39:34.621 --> 39:36.287
We could yell.

39:41.860 --> 39:44.729
- The neighbors, Jimmie.
- Oh, the neighbors?

39:44.731 --> 39:47.535
- Hmm.
- I got neighbors now.

39:51.371 --> 39:52.573
Attaboy.

40:57.436 --> 41:01.074
This nigga is a bitch.

41:45.285 --> 41:47.184
I'm a soft nigga.
Run the fake, nigga!

41:49.856 --> 41:51.189
On everything, bro.

41:51.191 --> 41:52.923
Man, this kid
was a straight sucker.

41:52.925 --> 41:54.459
You lyin', bro,

41:54.461 --> 41:56.894
on everything, bro,
straight sucker, bro.

41:56.896 --> 41:58.262
Tell him what happened.
I swear to God.

41:58.264 --> 41:59.196
Man, last night,
a white van pulled up.

41:59.198 --> 42:00.965
I swear to God, bro.

42:00.967 --> 42:02.332
This nigga Kofi ran
like a straight bitch!

42:02.334 --> 42:03.867
- He not lyin'!
- He gonna get us killed!

42:03.869 --> 42:05.135
You niggas sayin' I ran?
I didn't run, nigga!

42:05.137 --> 42:06.903
Man, fuck what you niggas
talkin' about.

42:06.905 --> 42:08.472
Shut the fuck up, bro,
he's a straight sucker, bro.

42:08.474 --> 42:10.073
Hey, hey, man, he got us
looking like bitches, bro.

42:10.075 --> 42:11.175
If I've gotta
get on this thing,

42:11.177 --> 42:12.209
I'm gonna be questioning you!

42:12.211 --> 42:13.811
You supposed to be my cousin.

42:13.813 --> 42:15.146
I'mma bet you supposed
to not run, nigga,

42:15.148 --> 42:16.747
and that's what
you supposed to do.

42:16.749 --> 42:19.249
All right, all right,
all right, all right, bro.

42:19.251 --> 42:20.417
All right, everybody
shut up, bro.

42:20.419 --> 42:21.785
All right,
everybody shut up, bro.

42:21.787 --> 42:23.454
Kofi, what happened, bro?

42:23.456 --> 42:24.457
Tell him.

42:25.457 --> 42:26.890
Uh...

42:26.892 --> 42:28.291
Why?

42:28.293 --> 42:31.095
- Tell him!
- Did you run, nigga?

42:31.097 --> 42:32.497
Nah, I didn't
run, nigga.

42:32.499 --> 42:34.030
I told you!

42:34.032 --> 42:36.267
- Lyin', lyin'.
- Man, fuck you, nigga.

42:36.269 --> 42:37.769
Get on him!

42:37.771 --> 42:38.939
Wow.

42:41.474 --> 42:43.407
- Hit me, bro.
- Man, what?

42:43.409 --> 42:44.410
Hit me, bro.

42:47.313 --> 42:48.879
Hit me, bro.

42:48.881 --> 42:50.180
And for what,
you supposed to be my folks.

42:50.182 --> 42:51.751
Hey, Kofi,
hit that nigga, bro.

42:52.485 --> 42:55.186
Yeah! Come on, bro!

42:55.188 --> 42:57.988
Yeah! Let's go! Let's go!
Get on him!

42:57.990 --> 42:59.990
Hit me, bro! Hit me, bro!

42:59.992 --> 43:01.091
This nigga's a bitch!

43:01.093 --> 43:03.126
Hit me, man! Come on!

43:03.128 --> 43:04.931
Guys! Guys!

43:05.965 --> 43:07.834
Great, it's great.

43:08.535 --> 43:11.169
Very good, very good.

43:11.171 --> 43:14.174
Cut! Very good, very good.

43:15.140 --> 43:17.175
Good, good, excellent.

43:17.177 --> 43:20.144
Good. Hey, great news

43:20.146 --> 43:22.579
is you're all doing
marvelous work.

43:22.581 --> 43:24.182
- What?
- Congratulations,

43:24.184 --> 43:25.519
it's not easy.

43:30.856 --> 43:32.823
I believe you.

43:32.825 --> 43:35.059
But I know
it can be deeper.

43:35.061 --> 43:37.030
- Fuck you talkin' about?
- Hey.

43:38.865 --> 43:40.997
Remember Stanislavski.

43:40.999 --> 43:42.200
Fuck are you doin', man?

43:42.202 --> 43:44.035
Grotowski or Slavski...

43:44.037 --> 43:45.570
Chekhov, bruh.

43:45.572 --> 43:47.508
- These are the greats.
- I'm confused, bro.

43:59.052 --> 44:00.419
You're okay there.

44:02.287 --> 44:03.356
You're okay there.

44:05.892 --> 44:07.461
Bro, you're not
a director, bro.

44:11.264 --> 44:12.896
Man, take your
weird ass outta here.

44:12.898 --> 44:14.932
Keep building it.

44:14.934 --> 44:16.100
Nigga, I don't like when that
nigga come around here, bro.

44:16.102 --> 44:17.468
Bro,
this nigga's a bitch.

44:17.470 --> 44:18.269
Say the word,
I get on this nigga, bro!

44:24.043 --> 44:25.412
Here we go.

44:49.535 --> 44:52.535
Watch this for me
real quick, bro.

44:52.537 --> 44:54.842
I know.

45:38.617 --> 45:41.053
I seen your cousin, Al,
the other day.

45:43.021 --> 45:46.222
Aight, "Hey, Uncle James!"

45:46.224 --> 45:48.091
I look like,
"Man, I don't know you,

45:48.093 --> 45:51.729
"down there struttin' around,
like a Frisco fruit cup."

45:51.731 --> 45:55.669
I know his daddy mad as hell.

45:57.669 --> 45:58.938
You still skateboarding?

46:00.639 --> 46:02.108
Nah.

46:05.177 --> 46:06.313
Hmm.

46:08.581 --> 46:09.916
What?

46:12.251 --> 46:13.954
Come here,
help me cut these out.

46:18.992 --> 46:21.624
And make sure the color bleeds
all the way through,

46:21.626 --> 46:23.727
no white edges, aight?

46:23.729 --> 46:25.698
Yes, sir. Same as always.

46:26.331 --> 46:27.333
Yeah.

46:28.534 --> 46:31.568
Same as always.

46:31.570 --> 46:34.372
Hey, you remember that, uh,
warehouse we squatted at?

46:34.374 --> 46:36.273
After we lived
in the El Dorado?

46:38.144 --> 46:39.443
We lost that ' cause we
didn't pay taxes, right?

46:39.445 --> 46:40.778
Hell, nah.

46:40.780 --> 46:43.082
I paid our fair share
of tax on that.

46:45.050 --> 46:48.285
But who cares,
old drafty-ass roach nest.

46:48.287 --> 46:50.220
Shit, it was that,

46:50.222 --> 46:52.491
or sleeping on the street
with your little ass.

46:53.593 --> 46:55.228
Well, I appreciate it, Dad.

46:55.695 --> 46:57.030
Mmm-hmm.

46:58.131 --> 47:00.734
So, say I'm at
a place now

47:02.101 --> 47:03.403
and the owners left it,

47:04.269 --> 47:05.702
I'm gonna pay taxes on it...

47:05.704 --> 47:08.805
And you put gas
and electric in your name?

47:08.807 --> 47:12.075
Right, I'm gonna do that next,
you know I know.

47:12.077 --> 47:14.680
Okay, doin' it
like your old man.

47:15.414 --> 47:18.048
That's good.

47:18.050 --> 47:21.117
And nobody's
come to check on it?

47:21.119 --> 47:22.588
Nope. It's empty.

47:24.590 --> 47:25.823
Good.

47:25.825 --> 47:27.361
That buys you time.

47:29.061 --> 47:30.429
And they been gone
three years?

47:31.530 --> 47:33.664
Nah, just recently.

47:33.666 --> 47:36.066
Wait, what?

47:36.068 --> 47:38.301
You were workin' on it
while they were still in it?

47:38.303 --> 47:39.506
Yeah.

47:42.108 --> 47:43.744
Where is this house?

47:46.345 --> 47:47.747
It's the house in Fillmore.

47:57.856 --> 47:59.125
Wow.

48:05.298 --> 48:06.566
Our old house.

48:10.570 --> 48:12.272
What the fuck you mean,
our old house?

48:15.608 --> 48:17.443
Have you seen that house?

48:19.878 --> 48:21.312
Well, yeah, I mean,

48:21.314 --> 48:23.146
I be over there all the time.

48:23.148 --> 48:24.682
Then you know
that's not your old house

48:24.684 --> 48:27.354
and that's not
your black-ass neighborhood.

48:31.791 --> 48:34.260
Little disrespectful
lyin' ass.

48:37.829 --> 48:41.101
- What are you talking about?
- Nigga, I know you skateboard!

48:45.204 --> 48:46.604
Yeah.

48:46.606 --> 48:48.475
Yeah, I see all that shit
out there.

48:49.275 --> 48:51.541
Everybody's little path.

48:51.543 --> 48:54.547
I'm like 30 steps
ahead of y'all.

49:03.488 --> 49:04.754
Go on.

49:04.756 --> 49:06.823
Get!

49:06.825 --> 49:09.195
You know we don't talk
about that house no more.

49:11.597 --> 49:13.332
Put the shit down
and go!

49:56.876 --> 49:58.644
Hey, you been
waiting here long?

49:59.778 --> 50:01.247
Hella long, bro.

50:02.347 --> 50:03.816
I might just skate.

50:05.885 --> 50:07.454
Well, that"s nice.

50:20.900 --> 50:24.702
This guy fucks.

50:24.704 --> 50:29.240
Hey, Sundeep.
Sundeep, bro, this guy fucks.

50:29.242 --> 50:30.841
This guy fucks!

50:30.843 --> 50:32.309
This guy fucks!

50:32.311 --> 50:35.312
This guy fucks!

50:38.251 --> 50:40.651
This guy fucks!
This guy fucks!

50:48.593 --> 50:50.896
Oh, this city.

50:52.798 --> 50:54.367
I already know, bro.

51:35.707 --> 51:36.976
Fuck!

51:38.677 --> 51:39.878
Are you okay?

51:42.981 --> 51:44.351
Yeah.

51:49.088 --> 51:50.423
Yeah.

51:56.628 --> 51:57.796
What is all this?

51:59.597 --> 52:00.666
Wow.

52:01.566 --> 52:03.033
A little room
I used to come in

52:03.035 --> 52:04.938
when my dad
was doing his thing.

52:06.706 --> 52:08.575
It's cool, right?

52:10.508 --> 52:11.777
Yeah, man.

52:14.347 --> 52:15.548
Did you see him today?

52:18.718 --> 52:19.986
How'd it go?

52:21.653 --> 52:23.523
He said this was
a bad idea.

52:27.026 --> 52:28.791
Thought you said
he was an idiot.

52:28.793 --> 52:31.664
Nah, he's just mad
'cause he lost the house.

52:33.932 --> 52:36.535
But what if
we shouldn't be here?

52:38.104 --> 52:39.872
Who should be here more?

52:41.474 --> 52:42.542
Hmm?

52:43.909 --> 52:45.512
Some millionaire?

52:49.414 --> 52:51.317
They'd want it
'cause it looks nice.

52:52.684 --> 52:54.787
You're the reason
it looks nice, Jim.

52:59.392 --> 53:00.791
I don't know.

53:04.063 --> 53:05.631
What the fuck?

53:07.066 --> 53:08.768
I invited somebody.

53:18.943 --> 53:20.676
What's good, nigga?

53:20.678 --> 53:22.349
Glad you could make it.

53:23.081 --> 53:24.650
What's goin' on?

53:30.088 --> 53:31.957
Be back in a sec,
pardon me.

53:32.892 --> 53:34.727
Y'all got an organ?

53:44.869 --> 53:46.138
Columns and shit.

54:06.659 --> 54:08.758
It's just y'all here?

54:08.760 --> 54:10.162
Yeah.

54:12.131 --> 54:13.967
It just makes noises.

54:15.166 --> 54:17.700
Oh, okay.

54:17.702 --> 54:19.001
It's nice to see you
in that chair,

54:19.003 --> 54:21.204
I didn't know
you'd pick that one.

54:21.206 --> 54:23.207
Thanks a lot, bro.

54:23.209 --> 54:24.944
Kinda awkward,

54:25.811 --> 54:27.079
but this place is cool.

54:28.079 --> 54:29.546
Yeah.

54:29.548 --> 54:31.615
Jimmie's been doing a lot
to fix it up.

54:31.617 --> 54:33.584
How'd y'all get this?

54:33.586 --> 54:34.721
It's Jimmie's.

54:35.854 --> 54:37.720
His grandpa built it.

54:37.722 --> 54:40.524
He was the first black man
in San Francisco.

54:40.526 --> 54:41.961
That's what
they call him anyways.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.863
Oh, shit.

54:46.599 --> 54:48.468
- This that house?
- Hmm.

54:49.834 --> 54:53.570
Hey, Jimmie used to talk
about this spot all the time.

54:53.572 --> 54:55.175
But you know how niggas
be in the group home.

54:56.207 --> 54:58.110
Overexaggerating and shit.

54:59.811 --> 55:01.213
Trying to be all special.

55:03.948 --> 55:05.952
You weren't lying about
this one, though, huh, Jimmie?

55:06.918 --> 55:08.787
You were in a group home?

55:11.023 --> 55:12.559
Yeah.

55:13.726 --> 55:15.128
For like a year.

55:16.061 --> 55:17.664
Yep.

55:22.166 --> 55:24.503
You guys wanna go
for a schvitz?

55:30.910 --> 55:32.178
A what?

55:40.785 --> 55:42.722
Wait, your grandfather
made this too?

55:44.657 --> 55:47.593
Nah. Nah,
these white people did.

55:49.028 --> 55:50.129
Uh-huh.

55:51.195 --> 55:53.829
Well, how you know he was
the first one, though?

55:53.831 --> 55:55.698
Nigga be lyin'.

55:55.700 --> 55:58.834
Bro,
he came over here from New Orleans.

55:58.836 --> 56:01.104
There was
hella Japanese people, bro.

56:01.106 --> 56:04.341
And then they got thrown
into little war camps

56:04.343 --> 56:06.709
and he wasn't tryin' to move
into nobody else's shit,

56:06.711 --> 56:08.611
so he built this, bro.

56:08.613 --> 56:10.782
This is great.

56:13.918 --> 56:15.287
You still skate, bro?

56:17.189 --> 56:18.955
Nah.

56:18.957 --> 56:20.890
No, I don't
skate no more.

56:20.892 --> 56:23.994
Oh, shit, I mean,
you used to be hella raw.

56:23.996 --> 56:25.298
Yeah.

56:27.099 --> 56:29.265
I don't know, I'm, uh...

56:29.267 --> 56:31.167
Hey, you remember Gunna?

56:31.169 --> 56:33.836
Remember when he got caught
stealing from the candy lady?

56:37.776 --> 56:39.742
Yeah, he's an ugly-ass
crier, really.

56:39.744 --> 56:41.079
Oh, man.

56:42.146 --> 56:44.381
Hurt as fuck!

56:44.383 --> 56:46.350
Hey, remember,
uh, Ms. Homer,

56:46.352 --> 56:48.117
the one that ran
the group home?

56:48.119 --> 56:50.019
- Oh yeah!
- And she cut that nigga hair,

56:50.021 --> 56:51.854

56:51.856 --> 56:53.724
Hella much!

56:53.726 --> 56:55.725
He goin', "Damn, that white
lady couldn't cut no hair!"

56:57.662 --> 57:00.162
Had that nigga's shit
lookin' like Lombard Street.

57:02.401 --> 57:04.901
That nigga said Lomb...

57:04.903 --> 57:08.305
Aw, man, you niggas gonna
make me piss on myself.

57:08.307 --> 57:10.774
Oh, shit, y'all got
a bathroom up in here, man?

57:10.776 --> 57:12.142
In this big-ass house?

57:12.144 --> 57:13.744
It's down the hall.

57:13.746 --> 57:15.778
It's the room with the
little claw-foot tub.

57:15.780 --> 57:19.151
Aight, this cool as shit,
big-ass house.

57:19.852 --> 57:21.054
Mans...

57:22.253 --> 57:24.655
I wish I had
a grandpa like you.

57:24.657 --> 57:27.057
Need me

57:27.059 --> 57:29.091
This shit is enjoyable.

57:29.093 --> 57:30.894

57:30.896 --> 57:33.332
I'm proud of you niggas.
You too, Mont.

57:33.965 --> 57:35.198
Crazy-ass.

57:35.200 --> 57:38.901

57:38.903 --> 57:41.405
Y'all niggas just really

57:41.407 --> 57:44.343
Aw, shit, I"m gonna go use
this bathroom real quick.

57:46.077 --> 57:48.044
You a funny
motherfucker, Jimmie.

57:49.682 --> 57:51.150
"You a funny
motherfucker, Jimmie."

58:13.939 --> 58:15.241
You should, uh...

58:16.809 --> 58:18.244
You should have
your own room, bro.

58:20.813 --> 58:22.178
That's okay, Jim.

58:22.180 --> 58:23.749
Nah, seriously, man.

58:25.117 --> 58:26.686
I been in
your space forever.

58:27.385 --> 58:29.054
This place is yours, too.

58:33.726 --> 58:34.894
Any room?

58:59.785 --> 59:01.120
How about this one?

59:04.155 --> 59:06.058
Are you sure
you want the dining room?

59:07.226 --> 59:08.695
Yeah.

59:11.028 --> 59:12.364
It's perfect.

59:19.104 --> 59:20.406
Dream big, bro.

59:21.372 --> 59:22.775
It's yours.

59:32.316 --> 59:34.050
Wow.

59:34.052 --> 59:36.285
Yeah, we're gonna have to
figure something out.

59:36.287 --> 59:38.220
I don't have
that much time.

59:38.222 --> 59:41.423
It's a complicated situation.

59:41.425 --> 59:42.892
No, the power's been on,

59:42.894 --> 59:44.362
I just need the bill
in my name.

59:47.566 --> 59:48.901
Uh-huh.

59:51.269 --> 59:54.106
Okay, great.
Well, when will I get the first invoice?

59:56.941 --> 59:59.445
And you can't mail that
any sooner?

01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:04.349
All right, yeah.

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:09.186
He's talking about
paying some bills.

01:00:09.188 --> 01:00:10.419
'Cause I wouldn't say no

01:00:10.421 --> 01:00:12.358
if he offered to chip in
a little more.

01:00:13.325 --> 01:00:15.258
He already
pays half, Grandpa.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:19.131
Well, he's been here
for a while, you know?

01:00:20.331 --> 01:00:22.167
And he is not
exactly family.

01:00:23.968 --> 01:00:25.869
I think he knows that.

01:00:25.871 --> 01:00:27.269
Let's hope so.

01:00:27.271 --> 01:00:29.872
What's all this noise
up in here?

01:00:29.874 --> 01:00:31.077
I'm just
packing some stuff.

01:00:33.144 --> 01:00:34.447
It's for a project.

01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:38.414
Since when?

01:00:38.416 --> 01:00:42.151
I mean, we haven't even talked
about the characters yet.

01:00:42.153 --> 01:00:43.419
You know how much
I like that.

01:00:43.421 --> 01:00:45.423
Yeah, well...
I'm still working on it.

01:00:46.892 --> 01:00:48.194
Don't quite have a plot yet.

01:00:49.861 --> 01:00:52.896
Well, we can brainstorm
a little bit.

01:00:52.898 --> 01:00:55.265
You know, that's where
I think we the best at.

01:00:55.267 --> 01:00:57.600
When we brainstorming.

01:00:57.602 --> 01:00:59.568
I think
I gotta brainstorm this one

01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:01.973
by myself right now.

01:01:05.177 --> 01:01:06.912
But I'd love to talk
about it soon.

01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:11.249
You 'bout
ready, bro?

01:01:13.452 --> 01:01:14.854
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:18.189 --> 01:01:19.492
Well, um...

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.596
Whatever it is, uh...

01:01:26.365 --> 01:01:27.867
I'm proud of you.

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:34.336
Wow, look at him.

01:01:34.338 --> 01:01:36.106
What type of shoes
are those?

01:01:36.108 --> 01:01:38.008
Yeah, you should start
rocking like that, bra-bra.

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.910
What the fuck is up
with your hat, Jimmie?

01:01:39.912 --> 01:01:42.178
You look like a human
cigarette, I can't handle it.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.414
Jimmie,
is that a bowling ball?

01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:46.416
It's the black
Alice and Wonderland.

01:01:46.418 --> 01:01:48.385
Hey, Monty, bro,
I heard you be whippin' out

01:01:48.387 --> 01:01:50.653
that little weenie
on all the girls.

01:01:52.189 --> 01:01:53.990
Bro, with that hair,
you look like a Simpson.

01:01:53.992 --> 01:01:56.392
Nigga, shut up, bro,
your one-shirt-havin' ass.

01:01:56.394 --> 01:01:59.361
Jimmie, you wear the same
shirt every motherfuckin' day.

01:01:59.363 --> 01:02:01.664
You look like a fiend,
Jimmie, come on!

01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:04.200
Hey, just like your daddy!

01:02:04.202 --> 01:02:05.669
I remember!

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:07.504
Your crackhead-ass daddy.

01:02:07.506 --> 01:02:10.407
And your
dumb-fiend-ass mom.

01:02:10.409 --> 01:02:12.108
Family of fiends, dog.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.410
I done sold him a rock
back in the day.

01:02:14.412 --> 01:02:15.678
Hey, what you
got up in there?

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.180
Some lace curtains
for that whole

01:02:17.182 --> 01:02:18.515
beautifyin'-ass house

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:20.182

01:02:20.184 --> 01:02:21.550
Okay, Kofi!
Okay, what else?

01:02:21.552 --> 01:02:23.419
Hey, look!
These niggas the other day,

01:02:23.421 --> 01:02:25.055
- they pulled up the other day.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:25.057 --> 01:02:26.622
Niggas had
all types of feminine shit

01:02:26.624 --> 01:02:28.490
goin' on
in that house, bro.

01:02:28.492 --> 01:02:30.193
Jimmie, what two men do that?

01:02:30.195 --> 01:02:32.028
Just 'cause you in

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:33.430

01:02:33.432 --> 01:02:35.664
- Never.
- You're not better than us.

01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:37.166
Hey, what is those,
lace curtains

01:02:37.168 --> 01:02:39.369

01:02:39.371 --> 01:02:41.437
Come on, man,
soft-ass nigga.

01:02:41.439 --> 01:02:44.573
I know who you is,
Jimmie, remember!

01:02:44.575 --> 01:02:45.675
Hey, you know
what y'all need to do?

01:02:45.677 --> 01:02:47.142
Y'all need to disappear

01:02:47.144 --> 01:02:48.577
like a motherfuckin'
magic trick, nigga!

01:02:48.579 --> 01:02:50.747
Rabbit out the hat,
get the fuck out here.

01:02:50.749 --> 01:02:52.015
Fuck outta here!

01:02:57.088 --> 01:02:59.557
Jimmie! Jimmie! Go home!

01:03:11.336 --> 01:03:12.972
You're really
drawing them?

01:03:17.476 --> 01:03:19.010
They just talk shit.

01:03:22.079 --> 01:03:23.681
Well, you talked shit
when I met you.

01:03:27.552 --> 01:03:28.621
I did?

01:03:29.421 --> 01:03:30.656
You did.

01:03:32.157 --> 01:03:33.225
It's fine, though.

01:03:38.764 --> 01:03:40.733
Why'd you hang out
with me, then?

01:03:43.367 --> 01:03:45.070
You care about things.
I liked you.

01:03:48.606 --> 01:03:51.043
You really don't give a fuck
what anybody says?

01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:55.178
I shouldn't get to
appreciate them

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.149
'cause they're mean to me?

01:04:00.084 --> 01:04:01.987
That's silly.

01:04:43.128 --> 01:04:44.196
Oh.

01:04:53.371 --> 01:04:54.506
Phew.

01:05:58.736 --> 01:06:00.305
What are you doing here?

01:06:02.273 --> 01:06:04.109
What are you
ever doing here?

01:06:06.343 --> 01:06:08.343
Uh...

01:06:08.345 --> 01:06:09.849
Didn't you
move out, though?

01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:12.684
Yeah.

01:06:14.586 --> 01:06:16.822
They changed
the fuckin' locks on me.

01:06:20.592 --> 01:06:22.727
I'm sorry, that sucks.

01:06:25.497 --> 01:06:27.332
What do you want, man?

01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:32.170
How long you gonna be here?

01:06:32.871 --> 01:06:34.671
I don't know yet.

01:06:34.673 --> 01:06:35.841
I'm just tryin' to...

01:06:37.943 --> 01:06:39.410
Let go.

01:06:40.778 --> 01:06:42.979
Okay, well...

01:06:42.981 --> 01:06:45.251
I guess we'll just
come back tomorrow then.

01:06:46.383 --> 01:06:48.450
Great.

01:06:48.452 --> 01:06:50.456
That's nice.

01:06:52.724 --> 01:06:55.524
Come on, Jim,
we'll go to my house.

01:06:55.526 --> 01:06:58.463
In this crazy fuckin'
city, you're still here.

01:07:09.506 --> 01:07:13.343
Man, those damn kids dropping
bubble gum all over the place,

01:07:13.345 --> 01:07:14.843
it'll get all over
your seat, man.

01:07:14.845 --> 01:07:16.412
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:19.884
Think she'll stay there
all night?

01:07:22.887 --> 01:07:24.320
Watch, we'll come back

01:07:24.322 --> 01:07:26.191
and she'll be painting
the windowsill.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.501
Yes, baby.
Yes, I will be there.

01:07:39.503 --> 01:07:40.637
I've been clean
for three years,

01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:42.305
I know where
those meetings are.

01:07:42.307 --> 01:07:43.573
All right, you got it.

01:07:43.575 --> 01:07:44.777
I'll be there
15 minutes early.

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.278
Yes. Yes, I told...

01:07:49.481 --> 01:07:50.582
Jayboe?

01:07:53.751 --> 01:07:54.887
Jayboe.

01:07:57.322 --> 01:07:58.524

01:08:17.008 --> 01:08:19.441
I thought you and Ron
were in LA.

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.580
Oh, no, we been back

01:08:23.814 --> 01:08:25.346
Uh...

01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:27.082
This is my friend, Mont.

01:08:27.085 --> 01:08:28.885

01:08:28.886 --> 01:08:30.319

01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:31.620
Pleasure to meet you.

01:08:31.622 --> 01:08:33.421

We been staying

01:08:34.826 --> 01:08:36.426
If, uh, you know...

01:08:36.428 --> 01:08:37.760
You should stop by.

01:08:37.761 --> 01:08:39.361
You know, come check it out.

01:08:39.363 --> 01:08:41.267
Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

01:08:42.599 --> 01:08:44.600
The house,
my dad's old house.

01:08:44.602 --> 01:08:45.868
Oh, your family house,

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:47.669
- on Golden Gate?
- Yeah.

01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:50.538
Okay. Well, I got your
number, I'll call you.

01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:52.510
Try to come over there tomorrow.

01:08:53.545 --> 01:08:55.546
Oh, I don't have a phone.

01:08:57.848 --> 01:09:00.716
Well, I just have to come over
there, then.

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:03.756
What's the best time to come?
I'll be over there tomorrow.

01:09:04.656 --> 01:09:06.087
Well, yeah, whenever.

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.024

01:09:09.993 --> 01:09:11.394
Okay.

01:09:11.395 --> 01:09:13.398
- Cool, I'll be there tomorrow.

01:09:15.066 --> 01:09:16.430
Yeah.

01:09:16.433 --> 01:09:17.698
Well...

01:09:17.701 --> 01:09:20.368
Our stop's coming up, but...

01:09:20.371 --> 01:09:22.537
Uh... It was really nice

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.971
Well, it was good

01:09:23.974 --> 01:09:25.041
Yeah.

01:09:25.042 --> 01:09:26.943
- All right.

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:28.711
- All right, bye now.

01:09:28.712 --> 01:09:30.879
Okay. Oh, my God,

01:09:30.881 --> 01:09:32.747
- Yeah, uh...
- Okay, bye, son.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.618
Yeah, bye. Uh...

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.761
Why? Why?

01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:46.162
What happened?

01:09:46.163 --> 01:09:47.499
Why?

01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:26.071
What the fuck?

01:10:33.143 --> 01:10:34.545
What happened?

01:10:41.518 --> 01:10:43.755
- What the fuck happened?
- He got shot.

01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:46.558
They shot him.

01:10:48.226 --> 01:10:49.961
Who? Who shot him?

01:10:54.933 --> 01:10:56.632
Who?

01:10:56.634 --> 01:10:58.003
Bay niggas.

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.406
For what?

01:11:02.973 --> 01:11:04.806
For what?

01:11:07.512 --> 01:11:09.180
He was talking shit
to the wrong niggas.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.816
Tried to bluff
some niggas out.

01:11:13.116 --> 01:11:14.717
Tried to bluff them out?

01:11:14.719 --> 01:11:17.022
Man, what's with
all the questions, bro?

01:11:19.624 --> 01:11:20.925
I just don't get it.

01:11:21.826 --> 01:11:23.493
I just fuckin'
seen y'all.

01:11:23.495 --> 01:11:24.627
And nigga?

01:11:24.629 --> 01:11:25.794
And I don't
fucking get it!

01:11:25.796 --> 01:11:27.696
Tsk. Man.

01:11:27.698 --> 01:11:29.699
Get the fuck

01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:30.967
Me get the fuck
outta here?

01:11:30.969 --> 01:11:32.968
- Yes, nigga, go!
- It's your fucking fault!

01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:34.540
That's my
fuckin' friend, too!

01:11:35.706 --> 01:11:37.739
- All right, nigga.
- Get on this nigga!

01:11:37.741 --> 01:11:39.208
All right.

01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:42.677
Push up on this nigga, bro.

01:11:42.679 --> 01:11:44.515
You finna
let him say that?

01:12:18.081 --> 01:12:20.184
<i>That poor
boy and his friends.</i>

01:12:24.656 --> 01:12:26.758
I'm sorry,
Jimmie.

01:12:29.661 --> 01:12:32.998
I hope I never made you feel
like you weren't welcome here.

01:12:35.332 --> 01:12:38.202
No, I... I never felt like that.

01:12:40.338 --> 01:12:43.942
'Cause I don't care
where you been.

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:47.112
You don't have
to tell me.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.983
It's just, you two

01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:54.253
stick together.

01:13:09.267 --> 01:13:11.670
You know, I was writing
a play about him.

01:13:18.643 --> 01:13:20.045
You don't have to stop now.

01:13:25.383 --> 01:13:27.318
"You a funny
motherfucker, Jimmie."

01:13:37.961 --> 01:13:40.098
I know
it sounds weird, but...

01:13:41.633 --> 01:13:43.335
I kinda feel like
that could've been me.

01:13:45.268 --> 01:13:47.004
If not for the house.

01:14:02.053 --> 01:14:03.854
Man, I wanna go home.

01:14:23.907 --> 01:14:27.043
<i>Filthy, fishy salt water.</i>

01:14:27.045 --> 01:14:30.413
<i>Water been funkier
than the Devil's mouth</i>

01:14:30.415 --> 01:14:32.181
<i>for 50 years.</i>

01:14:32.183 --> 01:14:34.252
<i>Now they wanna clean it up.</i>

01:14:35.753 --> 01:14:37.389
<i>They've got plans for us.</i>

01:14:39.823 --> 01:14:43.092
<i>We was made
to be put through Hell.</i>

01:14:43.094 --> 01:14:46.298
Purified... We was made
to be put through Hell.

01:14:48.165 --> 01:14:50.168
Be purified.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:03.948
Fuck!

01:15:05.082 --> 01:15:06.351
Oh, God.

01:15:09.353 --> 01:15:10.422
Fuck!

01:15:22.066 --> 01:15:23.702
How did she toss
all of our shit?

01:15:33.911 --> 01:15:35.347
I don't think it was her.

01:15:45.223 --> 01:15:46.323
Fuckin' traitor.

01:15:59.370 --> 01:16:00.738
Okay.

01:16:09.412 --> 01:16:11.279
Can you stay here
and watch the shit?

01:16:11.281 --> 01:16:12.883
Yeah, where you going?

01:16:15.286 --> 01:16:16.988
- Where you going?
- I'll be back.

01:16:17.487 --> 01:16:18.889
I'll be back.

01:16:21.424 --> 01:16:22.427
Jimmie!

01:16:27.932 --> 01:16:30.268
Sorry, uh,
how can I help you today?

01:16:33.237 --> 01:16:34.936
Uh...

01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:38.477
- I want to buy a house.
- A house?

01:16:39.977 --> 01:16:41.276
That's exciting.

01:16:41.278 --> 01:16:42.781
Uh, are you working
with an agent?

01:16:43.981 --> 01:16:45.751
No. Do I need to?

01:16:46.284 --> 01:16:48.050
No.

01:16:48.052 --> 01:16:49.851
Not necessarily. Um...

01:16:49.853 --> 01:16:51.419
Do you have a price range
in mind?

01:16:51.421 --> 01:16:53.023
I have a house in mind.

01:16:53.491 --> 01:16:55.291
Oh.

01:16:55.293 --> 01:16:57.493
Um...

01:16:57.495 --> 01:16:59.861
It's on the market,
I assume?

01:16:59.863 --> 01:17:01.232
How much
are they asking?

01:17:02.232 --> 01:17:04.533
At least $4 million.

01:17:04.535 --> 01:17:08.072
Uh... And how much are you
willing to put down?

01:17:09.607 --> 01:17:12.507
How much is usual?

01:17:12.509 --> 01:17:15.914
Well, typically,
we'd be looking to secure at least 20%.

01:17:24.021 --> 01:17:25.620
I wouldn't have that.

01:17:29.293 --> 01:17:31.025
That's understandable.

01:17:31.027 --> 01:17:33.294
It's going to be hard
to land a place like that.

01:17:33.296 --> 01:17:35.497
But suppose
I ask instead, uh...

01:17:35.499 --> 01:17:38.068
No, no, look.

01:17:38.936 --> 01:17:40.104
I get it.

01:17:41.539 --> 01:17:43.004
I'm young.

01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:44.409
Uh, I'm black.

01:17:45.242 --> 01:17:46.378
I'm not rich.

01:17:47.545 --> 01:17:49.611
I came here
knowing all that.

01:17:49.613 --> 01:17:52.480
But let's be real, you also
got a quota to meet.

01:17:52.482 --> 01:17:53.582
Now I'm not calling you

01:17:53.584 --> 01:17:55.150
- a predator...
- Sir.

01:17:55.152 --> 01:17:56.351
But you're trying
to make your money.

01:17:56.353 --> 01:17:57.586
- So let me help you do that.
- Sir.

01:17:57.588 --> 01:18:00.055
That's not the way
this works.

01:18:00.057 --> 01:18:01.590
You can give me whatever deal you
gotta give me. I don't care what it is.

01:18:01.592 --> 01:18:03.961
'Cause unlike all the other
people that default,

01:18:05.129 --> 01:18:07.663
this is the only house
I'll ever want.

01:18:07.665 --> 01:18:10.900
So I'll never miss
a monthly bill, ever.

01:18:10.902 --> 01:18:12.467
You can give me
your highest interest rate.

01:18:12.469 --> 01:18:14.203
I completely
understand how you feel, sir.

01:18:14.205 --> 01:18:15.671
You can give me your highest
interest rate, okay?

01:18:15.673 --> 01:18:17.138
- Fuck... Fuck me.
- No, I completely...

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.407
You don't even
have to feel bad.

01:18:18.409 --> 01:18:19.577
You don't even
have to feel bad.

01:18:20.678 --> 01:18:23.548
Okay? I will pay back
every single cent.

01:18:25.582 --> 01:18:27.650
I'm sorry, sir.

01:18:27.652 --> 01:18:29.988
I will pay back
every single cent.

01:18:32.423 --> 01:18:35.056
Okay, okay, you win!

01:18:36.259 --> 01:18:38.095
Okay, yep, it's yours.

01:18:38.995 --> 01:18:41.195
You charming
bastard, okay.

01:18:41.197 --> 01:18:43.168
Talk to you
soon, buh-bye.

01:18:44.936 --> 01:18:46.534
How's it going, man?

01:18:46.536 --> 01:18:47.872
Fine, sir.

01:18:49.406 --> 01:18:51.476
I noticed the house we
discussed is now for sale.

01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:55.644
There are some alarming
elements in your literature

01:18:55.646 --> 01:18:57.946
I thought
you would like to know.

01:18:57.948 --> 01:19:00.349
And certainly the Bureau
of Real Estate would.

01:19:00.351 --> 01:19:01.419
Uh-huh.

01:19:03.086 --> 01:19:04.552
This claims

01:19:04.554 --> 01:19:06.555
the property has a view
of the Golden Gate.

01:19:06.557 --> 01:19:08.157
Which...

01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:10.059
I don't think is true.

01:19:10.061 --> 01:19:11.392
Well,

01:19:11.394 --> 01:19:12.694
it isn't. It isn't true.

01:19:12.696 --> 01:19:14.629
It also claims
to have all the original

01:19:14.631 --> 01:19:16.565
"fixtures, floors,
and faucets."

01:19:16.567 --> 01:19:18.066
Isn't true.

01:19:18.068 --> 01:19:19.301
And are you planning
on disclosing

01:19:19.303 --> 01:19:20.970
that there's no septic tank?

01:19:20.972 --> 01:19:24.105
Which means, any day now,

01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:26.143
the garden could be flooded

01:19:26.744 --> 01:19:28.179
with shit.

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.413
Where's this going, man?

01:19:32.415 --> 01:19:34.516
Well...

01:19:34.518 --> 01:19:37.685
All this together seems
like false advertisement.

01:19:37.687 --> 01:19:39.488
Which is grounds
for void a sale.

01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:41.523
Potential revoke of license.

01:19:41.525 --> 01:19:43.495
I thought
it might've been you guys.

01:19:47.764 --> 01:19:49.934
What's your deal, man?

01:19:51.102 --> 01:19:52.336
Don't have a deal.

01:19:53.737 --> 01:19:55.572
Hmm. Look...

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:58.172
Somebody on this floor

01:19:58.174 --> 01:19:59.677
would've gotten that house
if it wasn't me.

01:20:00.777 --> 01:20:03.180
At least I'm
from here, right?

01:20:04.714 --> 01:20:06.582
I put your stuff
on the street

01:20:06.584 --> 01:20:08.316
- as a favor.
- Okay.

01:20:08.318 --> 01:20:09.485
I could've had it
trucked away,

01:20:09.487 --> 01:20:10.685
but I left it
out for you.

01:20:10.687 --> 01:20:12.721
Look, dick wad.

01:20:12.723 --> 01:20:14.757
I'm not fucking around,
I will report you.

01:20:14.759 --> 01:20:16.525
For what?

01:20:16.527 --> 01:20:19.328
Listing a view of the bridge?
And fixtures?

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:20.596
Everybody does that.

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:22.765
I literally copy-pasted
that shit.

01:20:22.767 --> 01:20:24.635
Well, you're lying about
the history of the house.

01:20:25.702 --> 01:20:27.202
I'm not lying about that.

01:20:27.204 --> 01:20:28.736
Yes, you are!
You say it was built

01:20:28.738 --> 01:20:30.439
one hundred years earlier
than it actually was.

01:20:30.441 --> 01:20:32.074
Look, I'm not
making this up.

01:20:32.076 --> 01:20:33.508
Yes, you are!

01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:36.177
James Fails built
this house in 1946.

01:20:36.179 --> 01:20:37.712
- James?
- Fails!

01:20:37.714 --> 01:20:39.614
What are you talking about?

01:20:39.616 --> 01:20:41.018
Look, man.

01:20:44.155 --> 01:20:46.154
Deed of Trust, 1857.

01:20:46.156 --> 01:20:49.059
Architect Gil-hoo-ley,
some shit.

01:20:51.128 --> 01:20:54.128
Your guy Fails lost it
in the '90s.

01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:55.467
See, right there.

01:20:57.101 --> 01:20:58.766
Look, man.

01:20:58.768 --> 01:21:01.369
If you need a week to find
somewhere else, then take it.

01:21:01.371 --> 01:21:03.337
But...

01:21:03.339 --> 01:21:07.011
Don't go pulling some squatters
rights shit on me, man.

01:21:08.745 --> 01:21:10.114
I got your mail.

01:21:12.249 --> 01:21:14.115
I know your name.

01:21:14.117 --> 01:21:15.652
I don't want
to call the cops.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.555
I don't want
to do that to you.

01:22:10.573 --> 01:22:11.709
Where'd you go?

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:15.679
Doesn't matter, bro.

01:22:18.482 --> 01:22:20.382
I got everything inside.

01:22:20.384 --> 01:22:21.786
Except the couch.

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:25.189
That shit almost fell on me.

01:22:29.626 --> 01:22:31.095
Jim...

01:22:32.729 --> 01:22:34.428
I spoke to the realtor.

01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:35.799
Yeah, fuck that guy.

01:22:41.304 --> 01:22:42.639
He's gonna throw us out.

01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:46.443
And eventually
call the cops.

01:22:48.879 --> 01:22:51.249
I don't know how much longer
we can keep doing this.

01:22:54.285 --> 01:22:55.854
I understand if you can't.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.223
I do.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:00.892
But I'm not leaving.

01:23:06.729 --> 01:23:09.500
- Jim, he said your grand...
- Where am I gonna go?

01:23:11.768 --> 01:23:13.504
My dad's in the SRO.

01:23:15.472 --> 01:23:17.509
My aunt's out
in bum fuck.

01:23:19.843 --> 01:23:21.312
My mom...

01:23:22.713 --> 01:23:25.750
Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

01:23:28.384 --> 01:23:29.887
I'm not leaving, bro.

01:23:33.557 --> 01:23:35.226
I'm the last one left.

01:23:41.631 --> 01:23:42.933
We have my house.

01:23:47.972 --> 01:23:49.807
I can't go
back there, bro.

01:23:54.945 --> 01:23:56.313
Mont,

01:23:57.481 --> 01:23:58.550
this house...

01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:03.284
This is what I do.

01:24:03.286 --> 01:24:04.888
Hey, it's what
we do, Mont.

01:24:06.389 --> 01:24:07.758
This is our shit.

01:24:08.592 --> 01:24:10.228
We can't give up now.

01:24:10.827 --> 01:24:12.330
We gotta fight.

01:24:13.897 --> 01:24:15.200
Right?

01:24:20.304 --> 01:24:21.472
Yeah.

01:24:25.409 --> 01:24:27.211
I'm with you, bro.

01:24:28.411 --> 01:24:29.680
You always been
with me.

01:24:55.406 --> 01:24:56.908
Oh, shit,
you're writing?

01:24:58.474 --> 01:25:00.441
Yeah. Uh...

01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:02.013
I think I cracked a play.

01:25:04.848 --> 01:25:06.414
I'd like to put it on
next week,

01:25:06.416 --> 01:25:07.584
if that's all right?

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.320

01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:04.027
Here we go.

01:28:15.772 --> 01:28:17.442
Why are you dressed
like a white boy?

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:23.011
Oh...

01:28:23.013 --> 01:28:24.782
It's for your
little show, huh?

01:28:45.635 --> 01:28:48.104
Man.

01:28:56.045 --> 01:28:58.115
You mess up my daddy's
chair, Montgomery?

01:29:00.717 --> 01:29:02.182
Huh?

01:29:02.184 --> 01:29:03.584
No.

01:29:03.586 --> 01:29:04.752
No, sir, we...
We were just...

01:29:04.754 --> 01:29:06.053
What you stuttering for?

01:29:06.055 --> 01:29:08.192
You got stage fright
already? Huh?

01:29:09.559 --> 01:29:10.628
No.

01:29:13.296 --> 01:29:15.763
I don't care about
the chair, son.

01:29:18.634 --> 01:29:19.970
But be easy with it.

01:29:21.204 --> 01:29:22.607
Thank you.

01:29:24.206 --> 01:29:26.177
Carry on.

01:29:59.675 --> 01:30:00.878
Phew.

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.983
My daddy hated
when I played that shit.

01:30:17.728 --> 01:30:19.931
Yeah, come on in,
don't be shy.

01:30:21.263 --> 01:30:23.099
His grandpa built it.

01:30:24.267 --> 01:30:25.967
Not bad for
a black man, huh?

01:30:25.969 --> 01:30:28.035
Oh, no.

01:30:28.037 --> 01:30:29.169
Very good.

01:30:29.171 --> 01:30:30.739
Very good.

01:30:38.014 --> 01:30:39.748
So, this is gonna
be interesting.

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.018
This is nice.

01:30:41.985 --> 01:30:43.717
- Nice crowd, too.
- Yeah.

01:30:43.719 --> 01:30:46.053
You make a lot of money
on candy?

01:30:46.055 --> 01:30:47.721
Sell candy?

01:30:47.723 --> 01:30:49.289
- I used to, for years.
- Oh, yeah?

01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:51.092
Most of these
new white people

01:30:51.094 --> 01:30:53.028
that's moving in these
black neighborhoods,

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.995
they don't even know they
standing in the kitchen

01:30:54.997 --> 01:30:57.666
- where a dude got shot at.
- Mmm.

01:30:57.668 --> 01:30:59.234
I didn't know he was
doing a play and shit.

01:30:59.236 --> 01:31:01.069
He just invited us,

01:31:01.071 --> 01:31:02.236
I don't know what weird
shit they got goin' on,

01:31:02.238 --> 01:31:03.771
but it's pretty weird.

01:31:16.385 --> 01:31:18.054
What I'mma hit you for?

01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:20.090
You my folks.

01:31:23.192 --> 01:31:24.394
All right.

01:31:25.295 --> 01:31:27.462
All right.

01:31:27.464 --> 01:31:29.800
But I can't have soft niggas
hanging around me.

01:31:34.905 --> 01:31:36.072
Hit me.

01:31:38.407 --> 01:31:40.175
Nah!

01:31:40.177 --> 01:31:41.245
Nah! For what, nigga?

01:31:42.312 --> 01:31:43.414
Hit me.

01:31:44.246 --> 01:31:46.683
Man up, nigga. Man up!

01:31:48.985 --> 01:31:50.217
No, bro!

01:31:50.219 --> 01:31:51.988
No! No, bro, no!

01:31:54.057 --> 01:31:55.358
Oh, you soft.

01:31:57.227 --> 01:31:59.793
You soft, nigga.

01:31:59.795 --> 01:32:02.262
They gonna call you
a bitch at your funeral.

01:32:02.264 --> 01:32:03.731
I ain't no bitch!

01:32:03.733 --> 01:32:05.900
I ain't no bitch! I'm a man!

01:32:05.902 --> 01:32:07.204
Then hit me.

01:32:08.071 --> 01:32:10.241
Hit me, bro. Hit me.

01:32:12.275 --> 01:32:13.341
Hit me, nigga.

01:32:24.754 --> 01:32:25.819
All right!

01:32:25.821 --> 01:32:26.954
All right!

01:32:26.956 --> 01:32:28.056
Yeah!

01:32:28.058 --> 01:32:29.324
Here, nigga.

01:32:29.326 --> 01:32:30.795
I don't give a fuck.

01:32:31.327 --> 01:32:32.961
Come see me, nigga.

01:32:32.963 --> 01:32:34.762
Who out there hiding?

01:32:34.764 --> 01:32:35.864
Man up!

01:32:35.866 --> 01:32:36.998
Man up, nigga!

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.065
- Man up!
- Hey!

01:32:45.174 --> 01:32:46.975
No words.

01:32:46.977 --> 01:32:48.211
No words!

01:32:49.146 --> 01:32:51.215
Please send e-hugs.

01:32:53.983 --> 01:32:55.251
Hazel Greene.

01:32:56.786 --> 01:32:59.022
One hundred
and thirty-five likes.

01:33:01.457 --> 01:33:02.992
Damn!

01:33:03.425 --> 01:33:05.059
Damn!

01:33:05.061 --> 01:33:07.063
Just smoked with you
the other day!

01:33:08.298 --> 01:33:09.467
Crazy!

01:33:10.967 --> 01:33:12.900
John Bishop.

01:33:12.902 --> 01:33:15.136
Two hundred
and sixty likes.

01:33:15.138 --> 01:33:16.372
Ten shares.

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.374
Are these the people

01:33:20.376 --> 01:33:21.745
who knew Kofi?

01:33:24.013 --> 01:33:27.317
Got yelled at by my bitch
boss for being late!

01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:29.184
Sorry!

01:33:29.186 --> 01:33:31.155
There's no timer for grief.

01:33:32.289 --> 01:33:33.523
Leah Tanaka, 320 likes.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.327
Man!

01:33:39.329 --> 01:33:42.465
Man! Can't believe
we lost my bro!

01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:45.900
But you wouldn't want me
to be sad, Ko,

01:33:45.902 --> 01:33:48.903
so I put my pain
into my music!

01:33:48.905 --> 01:33:51.071
Make sure you like the post.

01:33:51.073 --> 01:33:53.110
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rodney Tuck.

01:33:54.311 --> 01:33:55.944
Mr. Tuck

01:33:55.946 --> 01:33:57.515
moved to Florida

01:33:58.447 --> 01:33:59.784
ten years ago!

01:34:00.983 --> 01:34:02.550
Are these the people

01:34:02.552 --> 01:34:04.121
who knew Kofi?

01:34:05.589 --> 01:34:08.259
Kofi had dimensions.

01:34:09.392 --> 01:34:10.925
More than a...

01:34:10.927 --> 01:34:13.464
A post could reflect
or a play could capture.

01:34:16.098 --> 01:34:17.300
So I summon you.

01:34:19.201 --> 01:34:21.368
Celebrate the life he lived.

01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:23.637
Not through those
who speak the loudest.

01:34:23.639 --> 01:34:26.309
But through the memories
he left us all.

01:34:27.611 --> 01:34:29.409
Ma'am!

01:34:29.411 --> 01:34:31.214
- Me?
- Mmm. How will you...

01:34:32.514 --> 01:34:34.351
How will you remember Kofi?

01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:38.822
Um...

01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:41.892
Um...

01:34:43.927 --> 01:34:47.095
He, you know,
he used to come and walk my niece

01:34:47.097 --> 01:34:50.565
home from school when
she first moved up here.

01:34:50.567 --> 01:34:53.167
He was a little gentleman,
or whatnot,

01:34:53.169 --> 01:34:55.439
you know, sweet, um...

01:34:57.006 --> 01:34:58.409
It's just sad.

01:34:59.276 --> 01:35:01.074
Mmm.

01:35:01.076 --> 01:35:04.678
- I coached Kofi in Pop Warner.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.183
He stayed behind
and helped me pack up.

01:35:07.951 --> 01:35:09.320
Every day.

01:35:10.353 --> 01:35:11.522
Yeah.

01:35:13.956 --> 01:35:15.459
And how 'bout you,
young man?

01:35:21.298 --> 01:35:22.499
Shit, man.

01:35:24.233 --> 01:35:25.535
I don't know.

01:35:27.637 --> 01:35:29.273
Did I push him
too hard?

01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.009
Kofi was my nigga, man.

01:35:37.046 --> 01:35:38.482
Did I push him too hard?

01:35:47.290 --> 01:35:49.126
Mmm. How 'bout you?

01:35:56.198 --> 01:35:57.567
Well...

01:35:59.635 --> 01:36:01.371
My last memory of Kofi

01:36:02.638 --> 01:36:04.307
was him talking shit to me.

01:36:07.009 --> 01:36:09.177
He said some of
the most fucked-up shit

01:36:09.179 --> 01:36:10.948
anybody's ever said to me.

01:36:14.718 --> 01:36:16.684
But Kofi also got jumped

01:36:16.686 --> 01:36:18.285
for defending me
against the older kids

01:36:18.287 --> 01:36:19.589
in the group home.

01:36:20.723 --> 01:36:22.358
He didn't like to fight,

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.296
but he fought for me then.

01:36:28.665 --> 01:36:30.301
People aren't one thing.

01:36:40.076 --> 01:36:41.278
That.

01:36:45.115 --> 01:36:46.416
All...

01:36:47.250 --> 01:36:48.552
All of it.

01:36:51.653 --> 01:36:53.357
What would have happened

01:36:54.256 --> 01:36:56.160
if Kofi could've

01:36:57.259 --> 01:36:58.594
showed himself?

01:36:59.763 --> 01:37:02.131
All forms of himself.

01:37:05.434 --> 01:37:07.004
The world

01:37:09.071 --> 01:37:10.406
put him in a box!

01:37:12.409 --> 01:37:14.409
And he never

01:37:14.411 --> 01:37:15.612
pushed beyond it.

01:37:20.215 --> 01:37:21.418
Let us.

01:37:22.485 --> 01:37:24.621
Let us break the boxes!

01:37:26.055 --> 01:37:28.588
Let us give each other
the courage!

01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:29.625
To... To see!

01:37:30.626 --> 01:37:33.530
Beyond the stories
we are born into!

01:37:35.298 --> 01:37:36.433
Let us all

01:37:37.834 --> 01:37:39.103
really look

01:37:39.701 --> 01:37:42.171
at Jimmie Fails IV.

01:37:51.246 --> 01:37:52.715
Self-taught historian.

01:37:54.183 --> 01:37:55.485
Carpenter.

01:37:56.518 --> 01:37:58.653
Gentle, loving man.

01:37:58.655 --> 01:38:01.221
A true survivor. Jimmie!

01:38:01.223 --> 01:38:03.190
How many places
have you lived?

01:38:03.192 --> 01:38:05.193
And if they kicked
you out tomorrow,

01:38:05.195 --> 01:38:08.096
you would still
be all those things!

01:38:08.098 --> 01:38:10.131
You exist beyond the...

01:38:10.133 --> 01:38:13.333
These walls,
you extend beyond your...

01:38:13.335 --> 01:38:15.302
Your... Your forefathers!

01:38:15.304 --> 01:38:17.337
You are
more than this house!

01:38:17.339 --> 01:38:19.574
Jimmie, you are not these...
These walls!

01:38:19.576 --> 01:38:21.309
You're not these floors,
you're not this ceiling!

01:38:21.311 --> 01:38:23.377
- It's time you know!
- Bro, what are you doing?

01:38:23.379 --> 01:38:24.811
- What are you doing?
- It is time!

01:38:24.813 --> 01:38:26.646
- It is time you know!
- I don't need to know,

01:38:26.648 --> 01:38:29.419
I don't need to know.
Let's stop. Let's stop.

01:38:32.522 --> 01:38:34.489
- Jimmie... You don't!
- Enough, stop!

01:38:34.491 --> 01:38:36.289
- Please, stop. Mont!
- Jimmie!

01:38:36.291 --> 01:38:37.492
Your grandpa
didn't build this house!

01:38:37.494 --> 01:38:38.528
Enough!

01:38:43.165 --> 01:38:44.567
He didn't build it,
Jimmie!

01:38:54.811 --> 01:38:56.213
Yes, he did.

01:38:58.414 --> 01:39:01.181
- He built this house!
- He didn't, I saw it, man,

01:39:01.183 --> 01:39:02.385
I saw the deed.

01:39:04.521 --> 01:39:06.523
I saw it.

01:39:40.322 --> 01:39:42.593
I don't know
what the hell that thing was.

01:39:56.772 --> 01:39:58.605
Then he shoots
a left. Psh!

01:39:58.607 --> 01:40:00.543
Ha!

01:40:01.277 --> 01:40:02.842
Man, let 'em leave.

01:40:02.844 --> 01:40:04.847
They don't deserve
to be in here anyway.

01:40:10.519 --> 01:40:12.222
Neither do we.

01:40:16.259 --> 01:40:17.658
You gonna really listen
to what

01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:19.530
another-ass nigga
tell you what's true?

01:40:21.798 --> 01:40:24.632
Come on, Jayboe,
get your spine up, son.

01:40:24.634 --> 01:40:26.870
- Have some pride, man.
- I've been doin'.

01:40:35.711 --> 01:40:36.879
But you say it.

01:40:38.781 --> 01:40:40.250
Say what?

01:40:42.552 --> 01:40:43.687
The truth.

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:47.288
What?

01:40:47.290 --> 01:40:49.226
That grandpa
didn't build this house.

01:40:50.626 --> 01:40:52.959
Tsk. Man, get outta here
with that bullshit.

01:40:52.961 --> 01:40:54.564
Come on, Jayboe.

01:41:00.836 --> 01:41:02.371
Just say it.

01:41:16.619 --> 01:41:17.920
Can't tell you shit.

01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:23.490
I'm outta here, man.

01:41:23.492 --> 01:41:25.394
You sit in that
bullshit if you want.

01:42:56.152 --> 01:42:57.654
Jayboe.

01:43:05.394 --> 01:43:07.930
I been telling people
he built it for so long.

01:43:13.568 --> 01:43:15.504
Almost forgot it wasn't true.

01:43:20.710 --> 01:43:22.913
This was ours.

01:43:23.946 --> 01:43:25.349
And then it wasn't.

01:43:27.150 --> 01:43:29.717
So you just tell yourself
what you need

01:43:29.719 --> 01:43:31.722
to make you feel
like it still is.

01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:36.593
Shit.

01:43:37.593 --> 01:43:38.762
I did it, too.

01:43:44.133 --> 01:43:45.669
It makes you feel

01:43:47.469 --> 01:43:48.804
special.

01:43:51.773 --> 01:43:53.740
But you got a chance
to get out

01:43:53.742 --> 01:43:55.611
from underneath
all of that now.

01:43:57.914 --> 01:43:59.448
I don't want to.

01:44:01.651 --> 01:44:02.986
I just want it.

01:44:07.055 --> 01:44:08.558
Is that what
you really want?

01:44:11.893 --> 01:44:15.064
To spend the rest of your
life working for this?

01:44:16.732 --> 01:44:18.168
Fighting for this?

01:44:22.472 --> 01:44:24.571
I believe that

01:44:24.573 --> 01:44:26.039
you could make
this place yours.

01:44:26.041 --> 01:44:27.544
I really do.

01:44:34.983 --> 01:44:36.486
But if you leave

01:44:40.857 --> 01:44:42.626
it's not your loss.

01:44:44.594 --> 01:44:46.196
It's San Francisco's.

01:44:53.035 --> 01:44:54.938
Fuck San Francisco.

01:45:37.213 --> 01:45:39.212
- This city blows.
- Big time.

01:45:39.214 --> 01:45:41.047
I mean, whatever,
I'm not above

01:45:41.049 --> 01:45:43.816
living in a former
crack house, you know?

01:45:43.818 --> 01:45:46.252
But, I came here for Janis
and the Airplane,

01:45:46.254 --> 01:45:48.721
not to work
at a fucking startup.

01:45:48.723 --> 01:45:50.591
Dude, I've been saying
for months,

01:45:50.593 --> 01:45:52.226
let's just move to East LA.

01:45:52.228 --> 01:45:53.663
This city's dead.

01:45:54.196 --> 01:45:55.663
Nah.

01:45:55.665 --> 01:45:57.067
Seriously,
fuck this city.

01:45:59.201 --> 01:46:00.570
'Scuse me?

01:46:03.572 --> 01:46:05.207
You don't get to hate
San Francisco.

01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:10.514
I'm sorry, what?

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.913
Yeah, dude, I mean...

01:46:12.915 --> 01:46:14.784
Sorry, but I'll hate
what I want.

01:46:17.353 --> 01:46:18.788
Do you love it?

01:46:20.956 --> 01:46:23.058
It's... I mean yeah,
I'm here.

01:46:24.026 --> 01:46:25.629
But do I have
to love it?

01:46:27.095 --> 01:46:29.064
You don't get to hate it
unless you love it.

01:46:32.367 --> 01:46:34.036
Classic Muni shit.

01:46:43.879 --> 01:46:46.680
Who call the money man,
come on now, hurry up.

01:46:46.682 --> 01:46:47.717
Pay attention!

01:46:50.286 --> 01:46:52.285
Alexander the Great
was a black man.

01:46:52.287 --> 01:46:54.857
They don't teach you that
in the devil school system.

01:46:57.125 --> 01:46:59.562
I can't take another day
of this bullshit.

01:48:07.463 --> 01:48:09.131
Oh, Jim.

01:48:15.137 --> 01:48:16.706
I'm sorry I did that.

01:48:19.407 --> 01:48:20.977
It was a stupid play.

01:48:24.245 --> 01:48:25.881
Nah.

01:48:27.049 --> 01:48:28.985
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you the truth.

01:48:32.787 --> 01:48:34.723
I just wanted it to be true.

01:48:36.959 --> 01:48:38.394
It felt so good, you know?

01:48:44.834 --> 01:48:46.001
It's okay.

01:49:05.521 --> 01:49:07.221
Hey, Jimmie.

01:49:07.223 --> 01:49:08.425
Are you hungry?

01:49:09.258 --> 01:49:10.727
Fucking starving.

01:49:16.064 --> 01:49:18.364
He's giving up.

01:49:18.366 --> 01:49:20.434
I can't take no more.

01:49:21.903 --> 01:49:23.002
He's breaking down.

01:49:23.004 --> 01:49:24.837
Oh, wow.

01:49:24.839 --> 01:49:26.073
He's really
tearing this apartment apart.

01:49:27.375 --> 01:49:30.177
This looks exciting
though, you know?

01:49:30.179 --> 01:49:32.779
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.
- Yeah? Oh, yeah?

01:49:34.916 --> 01:49:37.417
- Oh! I got it now.
- Oh!

01:49:37.419 --> 01:49:39.185
He seems like
he's horny or something.

01:49:45.427 --> 01:49:47.097
He's banging
on the door again.

01:50:22.330 --> 01:50:24.096
<i>I will.</i>

01:50:24.098 --> 01:50:25.498
<i>I'm leaving
San Francisco today,</i>

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.133
<i>but I'll be back
in about a week,</i>

01:50:27.135 --> 01:50:28.202
<i>I'll take care of it
for you then.</i>

01:50:29.604 --> 01:50:31.238
<i>Well,
I've seen him worse.</i>

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.940
<i>Well have
a nice time, Bert.</i>

01:50:32.942 --> 01:50:33.574
- <i>Yeah, thanks.</i>
- <i>Why don't you...</i>

01:53:50.115 --> 01:53:55.115
