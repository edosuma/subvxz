WEBVTT

00:07.466 --> 00:12.513
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.055 --> 00:18.311
<i>If I had a heart
I could love you</i>

00:18.644 --> 00:22.773
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:24.984 --> 00:28.738
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:35.161
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.334 --> 00:45.421
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

01:11.572 --> 01:12.948
King Harald!

01:15.368 --> 01:17.620
I will think of you in York.

01:18.913 --> 01:21.874
I left some good men
in charge there.

01:22.792 --> 01:25.127
I will be glad to meet them,

01:25.211 --> 01:29.965
but York will only be
a staging post for us.

01:30.466 --> 01:35.680
Good. I still consider it
part of my new kingdom.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.516
I think it is a good thing
that I'm leaving.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.310
Yes, I agree.
I think it is a good thing.

01:42.061 --> 01:44.605
But don't worry.

01:44.689 --> 01:48.067
With my ships filled
with treasure and slaves,

01:48.776 --> 01:50.069
I will come back.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.196
Skol.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.533
Skol.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.922
What's the matter with you, huh?

02:10.005 --> 02:11.382
Little brother?

02:11.465 --> 02:13.509
I am not your little brother.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.178
And you know
exactly what's wrong with me.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.723
Margrethe is dead.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.015
I know.

02:20.099 --> 02:22.852
Of course, you know!
You ordered the killing!

02:25.104 --> 02:26.230
Why would I do that?

02:28.065 --> 02:31.861
Because she knew that you can
never get a woman pregnant.

02:37.408 --> 02:41.787
But that is not quite true.
Is it, sweet?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.915
No.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.376
Tell them why.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.087
For I am with child.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.217
She is With my Child.

02:57.636 --> 03:01.348
And in any case,
she was a crazy woman.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.024
I liked her.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.861
She was right about you
from the very beginning, Ivar.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.447
Be very careful of what you
say about me, Hvitserk.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.200
Why? Will you kill me next?

03:22.203 --> 03:25.372
Just remember I am also a
son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

03:25.456 --> 03:28.459
The people of Kattegat
don't love you, Ivar.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.919
What do you think they would do

03:30.002 --> 03:32.630
if you even touched
the hair on my head?

03:35.257 --> 03:36.967
Well, just a thought.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.469
Why don't you go back to England

03:38.552 --> 03:40.137
with King Harald, then?

03:42.306 --> 03:47.144
I belong here with you, Ivar.
You know that.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.439
I chose your side.

03:50.523 --> 03:53.943
And now, for good or ill,

03:54.276 --> 03:56.487
you're stuck with me.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.121
Hyah!

04:08.082 --> 04:09.083
Hyah!

04:11.418 --> 04:14.213
Bishop Cuthred is dead.
What?

04:14.296 --> 04:16.090
Cuthred is dead.
Murdered!

04:16.173 --> 04:17.550
Murdered? By who?

04:18.175 --> 04:20.678
By Lord Heahmund.
In the cathedral.

04:21.804 --> 04:23.222
Where is Heahmund, now?

04:23.305 --> 04:25.766
Here, in the chapel.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.982
Let me speak with him alone.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.066
But he will...
Alone.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.241
Heahmund!

04:44.076 --> 04:46.245
How dare you?
Sire.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.497
In all of this world,
there can be no justification

04:48.581 --> 04:51.834
for murdering a servant
of God in His own house.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.717
And now, still drenched
in the martyr's blood,

04:53.794 --> 04:55.796
you come and defile
this holy place, too.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.049
Surely, to God, you do not mean
to try and defend yourself.

04:59.758 --> 05:04.722
I killed Cuthred because
he and the other bishops,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.766
clergy, and several of
your leading ealdormen,

05:08.142 --> 05:12.938
formed a conspiracy to
overthrow you, andthen,

05:13.022 --> 05:14.398
to assassinate you,

05:14.899 --> 05:18.193
for your attacks on the power
and privilege of the church,

05:18.986 --> 05:21.030
which they think
has onlyjust begun.

05:21.822 --> 05:26.076
For your offer of friendship to
pagans, and for your weakness.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.705
I felt I had no choice but act,

05:29.788 --> 05:31.373
to save both your crown,

05:33.083 --> 05:34.919
and your life.

05:37.463 --> 05:40.299
Did he tell you who else
was involved in the conspiracy?

05:40.674 --> 05:43.052
What other Bishops? Ealdormen?

05:43.135 --> 05:46.138
No, only that Cuthred
was at the heart of it.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.782
And he told me
that if I now restored him

05:47.806 --> 05:48.867
to the bishopric of Sherborne,

05:48.891 --> 05:50.851
then he might
easily identify the others.

05:50.935 --> 05:53.145
But if you were
to reinstate Heahmund,

05:53.228 --> 05:55.481
it would cause the greatest
outrage and resentment,

05:55.564 --> 05:56.857
especially in the church.

05:56.941 --> 05:59.526
Even so, Mother, Heahmund
has possibly shown himself

05:59.610 --> 06:00.778
to be my greatest supporter.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.154
This is true.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.447
I have to say, brother,

06:03.822 --> 06:05.240
that I'm amazed and outraged

06:05.324 --> 06:07.534
that you would even
consider giving shelter,

06:07.618 --> 06:08.786
let alone preferment

06:08.869 --> 06:10.371
for a self-acknowledged
murderer.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.415
Instead, Heahmund
shall be punished

06:13.499 --> 06:14.708
for his heinous crime.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.252
That is not your
decision, brother.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.421
For I am King,

06:19.505 --> 06:21.674
and I alone can make
that determination.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.911
We are not sure
what has happened.

06:50.995 --> 06:53.163
No one has told us.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.790
Butlsee you are imprisoned.

06:55.124 --> 06:57.209
I killed the man
who replaced me as bishop.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.669
Why?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.004
He found out about us.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.840
He would have
betrayed me to King Alfred,

07:02.923 --> 07:05.467
and I would never
have been restored.

07:05.551 --> 07:10.431
So now, everything
depends on the King.

07:10.806 --> 07:14.184
Yes. Everything.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.688
If he believes that we will
protect him against his enemies,

07:17.771 --> 07:20.399
then all shall be well.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.110
I'm not sure what
to think about you.

07:23.444 --> 07:26.155
I'm trying to do
the right thing.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.491
For us, and for Wessex.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.581
And yet, now,
you are imprisoned.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.220
Grandfather,

07:51.889 --> 07:55.851
you have laid upon me,
such a burden.

07:58.687 --> 08:03.692
I'm not sure your choice
was wise, after all.

08:05.069 --> 08:08.781
They whisper that I'm weak.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.660
I fear they're right.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.711
Grandfather, give me strength.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.635
<i>King Alfred is in trouble.</i>

08:29.802 --> 08:34.014
There are those here,
who want to overthrow him.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.058
They think he's weak.

08:36.141 --> 08:40.229
They don't like the fact that
he allows us to live here.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.773
But Bishop Heahmund said
he'd protect us.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.483
He is imprisoned for murder,

08:44.566 --> 08:46.860
and incapable
of protecting anyone.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.467
Perhaps we should
never have come here.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.285
If we stayed in Norway, Torvi,
we would all be dead by now.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.704
It seems we're all at the mercy

08:57.788 --> 08:59.540
of circumstances
beyond our control.

08:59.623 --> 09:04.128
We have to pray to the Gods that
the King overcomes his enemies.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.589
Pray? Is that
all we can do? Pray?

09:07.756 --> 09:09.800
No.

09:11.176 --> 09:14.930
There is something else
that we can do.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.435
The King has asked us to be
baptized in the Christian faith.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.355
That way, he can
appease his enemies.

09:23.856 --> 09:26.900
He will no longer be supporting
and harboring pagans,

09:27.192 --> 09:29.278
but we will be
fellow Christians.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.238
He asked you this personally?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.406
Yes.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.158
And did you tell him
that there was no way

09:34.241 --> 09:36.076
that you would
renounce our Gods?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.078
Did you?

09:38.162 --> 09:40.998
Our father is in Valhalla.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.499
He's sitting
beside the Allfather.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.126
He's sitting across from Thor.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.670
They are drinking together,
and they are happy together.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.481
Are you telling me
that you don't believe it?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.674
I think what Ubbe... BJORN:
Let Ubbe speak for himself.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.802
What do you say, Ubbe?

09:54.511 --> 09:55.888
Our father stopped believing it.

09:55.971 --> 09:56.972
Bah!

09:59.474 --> 10:02.811
Did King Alfred
tell you that, too?

10:04.354 --> 10:08.108
And you actually believed him?

10:10.485 --> 10:14.615
Sometimes, I wonder
if you're Ragnar's son at all!

11:38.240 --> 11:41.451
Did you see them?
No.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.162
Perhaps, they're not coming.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.998
They will come.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.056
Son.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.018
Father.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.273
So, Floki, what is it
you have to say?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.650
We're all here.

12:15.068 --> 12:19.322
I've risen from the dead.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.907
Just as Odin did.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.202
Idied,

12:24.286 --> 12:26.872
and then I was reborn,

12:26.955 --> 12:28.373
here, on this island.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.711
Among the Gods.

12:33.295 --> 12:37.924
But I don't care about myself.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.010
I care about all of you.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.471
I want you to live
together peacefully.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.060
I've suffered the loss
of two of our children.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.437
Bul

12:51.938 --> 12:53.023
and Thorgrim.

12:53.940 --> 12:54.941
Hmm.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.236
I know what it's like
to lose a child.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.741
The days ahead will be hard.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.037
And our real hope

13:07.120 --> 13:09.581
lies with the child that
Ketill's daughter, Thorunn,

13:09.664 --> 13:11.958
carries in her belly.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.712
For Eyvind's son,
Helgi was also involved.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.513
So, now, I beg of you all
one last time,

13:24.596 --> 13:26.765
to please bury your axes.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.485
Floki's right.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.785
I have been harsh on Floki.

13:49.454 --> 13:54.251
It's true I doubted his motives.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.461
But I see I was wrong.

13:59.798 --> 14:05.637
I believe Floki
is a pure spirit.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.307
The death of my son, Bul,

14:09.391 --> 14:14.104
caused my family terrible grief.

14:14.938 --> 14:18.316
But I see now,
the death of Thorgrim,

14:18.400 --> 14:22.404
caused Ketill and his family
the same agony.

14:26.992 --> 14:27.993
So,

14:30.954 --> 14:34.708
let us look forward,

14:35.667 --> 14:37.711
as a community,

14:39.045 --> 14:42.716
to the birth of a new child.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.680
Let us drink to the new child.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.105
Skol!

14:57.189 --> 14:59.357
Skol!

15:07.991 --> 15:10.827
You two.
Captain's calling. Now!

15:33.558 --> 15:38.730
Princess Elsewith. I have neither
courted, nor attended to you.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.108
If you told me that you no longer
had any desire to marry me,

15:42.651 --> 15:44.986
then I would understand,
and freely release you

15:45.070 --> 15:46.988
from any agreement
made in my name.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.199
However,

15:49.282 --> 15:51.201
in the unlikely event
that you were still

15:51.284 --> 15:55.580
willing to proceed
with the marriage,

15:55.664 --> 15:58.625
then let me tell you
what you might expect.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.337
You'll be queen
to a kingdom at war,

16:02.420 --> 16:04.798
and likely soon
to be attacked again.

16:05.173 --> 16:06.716
You'll be married to a king

16:06.800 --> 16:11.137
who is in present danger of being
overthrown and assassinated.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.681
Forgive me, My Lady,

16:12.764 --> 16:16.643
but I cannot make the prospect
sound any more attractive.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.727
Thank you.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.691
I have nothing to go back to,
nor any wish to do so.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.818
If I were your wife,

16:25.193 --> 16:29.030
I would gladly share
your dangers and tribulations,

16:29.114 --> 16:30.699
and help you carry
the terrible burden

16:30.782 --> 16:32.534
that fate has placed upon you.

16:35.203 --> 16:38.873
I had not expected this conversation
to proceed in this manner.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.250
Good.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.461
I would hate you ever
to think me predictable.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.648
My Lords,

17:03.732 --> 17:07.110
I've summoned you here once more
because after much prayer and thought,

17:07.235 --> 17:08.903
I've made an important decision.

17:09.487 --> 17:12.032
I've decided to restore
His Grace Bishop Heahmund,

17:12.115 --> 17:13.450
to the bishopric of Sherborne.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.577
- What?
- No!

17:19.539 --> 17:20.540
He's mad!

17:25.337 --> 17:28.381
The murder of Lord Cuthred must
forever be upon his conscience

17:28.465 --> 17:31.634
and he must defend himself
before God.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.805
But we, My Lords, in these
dark and most uncertain days,

17:35.889 --> 17:38.475
when Wessex is threatened as
never before in our history,

17:38.600 --> 17:40.685
we cannot,
and I will not do without

17:40.769 --> 17:43.104
the services of the man
who is our sword,

17:43.188 --> 17:45.482
the greatest warrior
for Christ in this kingdom.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.235
He's mad.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.032
What should we do?

17:54.115 --> 17:57.410
He's a madman.
He's a madman.

17:57.994 --> 18:02.082
I wish also, to announce my marriage
to Princess Elsewith of Northumbria.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.793
How lovely!

18:05.126 --> 18:07.420
Maybe an heir,
good news at last.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.715
There is one final matter.

18:14.803 --> 18:18.515
<i>Ubbe. the son of Ragnar Lombtok.
And ms We. Tom,.</i>

18:18.598 --> 18:22.185
Have agreed to be baptized
into our Christian faith.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.525
My Lords! Please!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.824
I ask all of you, in God's name,

18:35.907 --> 18:40.578
to recognize
and celebrate this conversion.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.872
It marks the beginning
of something important.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.875
Without the help of these people,
who were once our enemies,

18:45.959 --> 18:50.213
Wessex cannot,
and will not survive.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.508
No!

18:59.806 --> 19:01.850
He's mad. MAN 2 ...keep
the kingdom together?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.093
He should not have done that.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.769
He should never have
put the murderer

19:04.853 --> 19:06.813
to such a high position
in our holy church.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.941
Alfred is doing what he thinks
is best for Wessex.

19:10.024 --> 19:14.571
And we must support him,
must we not?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.448
He's my brother.
Of course, I support him.

19:17.532 --> 19:20.743
Good. At least, his marriage
is arranged and settled.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.787
Now, it's time to arrange yours.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.623
You have no need to arrange
everything in the world.

19:26.207 --> 19:30.295
And as a matter of fact,
I've already chosen my bride.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.088
May I know her name?

19:32.755 --> 19:34.382
Ethelfled.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.887
Do I know her?
I do not think so.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.223
She's Cuthred's daughter.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.776
Open the gate!

19:56.487 --> 20:00.783
He's strong! And all his
teeth and fingers, too.

20:00.867 --> 20:05.079
Come on! Six? Seven? Eight?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.878
Welcome back!

20:11.961 --> 20:14.172
King Harald! Welcome!

20:14.255 --> 20:16.299
King Harald!

20:41.699 --> 20:44.786
Before being received
into God's holy Church,

20:44.869 --> 20:47.205
you must renounce
your former errors.

20:49.082 --> 20:54.879
I renounce my belief in Odin,
and all other pagan Gods.

20:54.963 --> 20:59.300
I renounce my belief in Odin
and all other pagan Gods.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.436
With my breath,

21:10.520 --> 21:14.190
I do exorcise these evil
spirits which inhabit you.

21:32.417 --> 21:33.918
Amen.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.406
Welcome!

22:08.453 --> 22:13.249
King Harald Finehair.
Welcome to York.

22:13.333 --> 22:18.254
I am Jarl Olavson. Ivar the
Boneless left me in Charge here.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.716
I'm happy to meet you,
Jarl Olavson.

22:21.799 --> 22:26.095
But don't expect to be in
Charge here for much longer.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.354
We have just been
promised eternal life.

22:34.812 --> 22:38.066
I don't feel any different.
Do you?

22:39.067 --> 22:40.068
Hmm'?

22:42.820 --> 22:44.906
I now have to wear
these crosses, though.

22:48.534 --> 22:54.457
They said that their new God
died on the cross for our sins.

22:54.665 --> 22:58.211
What sins?
Well...

23:21.859 --> 23:26.239
Now, I do feel different.

23:26.364 --> 23:27.804
Well, you could always
wear it again.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.628
Do you, Alfred,
son of Aethelwulf,

23:40.711 --> 23:42.463
before all these witnesses
here gathered,

23:42.755 --> 23:47.343
take this woman, Elsewith,
as your lawful wife,

23:47.427 --> 23:51.389
to have and to hold, from this
moment until death parts you?

23:51.722 --> 23:52.765
I do.

23:53.599 --> 23:57.103
And you, Elsewith, before all
these witnesses here gathered,

23:57.311 --> 24:02.316
take this man, Alfred, to have and
to hold, forsaking all others,

24:02.400 --> 24:06.279
to serve and obey until you die?

24:06.362 --> 24:07.405
I do.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.374
Amen.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.834
Amen.
Amen.

24:20.418 --> 24:24.046
In the sight
of all these witnesses,

24:24.130 --> 24:25.465
and in the sight of God,

24:25.965 --> 24:28.176
I now pronounce you,

24:28.259 --> 24:31.387
man and wife.

24:54.243 --> 24:57.455
Bjorn Ironside.
Yes?

24:57.580 --> 25:00.208
You and I have much in common.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.420
How?

25:06.047 --> 25:07.507
We share the same father.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.557
My name is Magnus. I'm Ragnar's
son by Queen Kwenthrith.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.768
I grew up here on the
royal estate with Alfred.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.395
He was my childhood friend.

25:21.479 --> 25:26.108
But in the end, after
Ragnar was imprisoned here,

25:26.192 --> 25:29.695
I was expelled.

25:29.820 --> 25:34.825
Alfred's family threw me
to the wolves.

25:35.618 --> 25:38.287
We had heard Ragnar
fathered a son in Wessex.

25:38.371 --> 25:42.792
Yes, I managed to survive. Of
course, they don't know I survived.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.627
They don't even know who I am.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.047
I heard you were here.
My half-brothers.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.300
And I had to see you.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.219
Well, this is incredible.

25:53.302 --> 25:57.932
You have no idea
how happy this makes me.

25:58.015 --> 26:01.227
After all these years
of being lost.

26:06.566 --> 26:10.570
Well, now, my brother,
you are found.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.214
The gate! The gate!

27:17.803 --> 27:19.722
Make way.

27:21.682 --> 27:26.270
I'm here to attack Wessex.

27:26.354 --> 27:32.360
Their defenses were weakened
by our Great Army.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.445
But I saw enough
when I was there

27:34.528 --> 27:37.073
to know that there are still
plenty of places to plunder.

27:37.490 --> 27:42.870
And I want to be rich, for I
have considerable ambitions.

27:42.953 --> 27:47.917
It may interest you to know
that Wessex has a new king.

27:48.125 --> 27:52.254
Who? A boy. Ecbert's grandson.
Alfred.

27:53.756 --> 27:56.801
Then they're even weaker
than I thought.

27:57.343 --> 28:01.263
Why did you say that I would
not be in charge very long?

28:01.806 --> 28:05.017
As far as I know, you and Ivar,
the Boneless, are allies.

28:06.185 --> 28:11.107
I didn't mean to insult you.

28:11.190 --> 28:15.528
I want to invite you
to rape Wessex with me.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.364
We can enjoy
the fruits of victory,

28:18.447 --> 28:20.282
and then we can make new plans.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.452
New plans?

28:23.953 --> 28:27.706
Do you want to stay here,
in York, all your life,

28:27.790 --> 28:29.291
and look after it for Ivar?

28:32.336 --> 28:37.299
No. It's true, I've always
had bigger ambitions.

28:37.633 --> 28:41.429
A Viking.
Of course, you did.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.013
So...

28:44.849 --> 28:49.603
After we plunder Wessex,
you and I, together,

28:49.979 --> 28:52.982
will return in triumph
to Kattegat.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.401
To share our spoils
with its king?

28:56.277 --> 29:00.072
No. We overthrow its king.

29:06.495 --> 29:10.416
It seems to me, that you are
not a son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

29:10.499 --> 29:14.462
Neither am I. But the
sons of Ragnar Lothbrok

29:14.545 --> 29:18.007
are the most famous people
in all our world.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.218
And I'm not sure that I
wish to fight against them.

29:21.302 --> 29:22.303
Any of them.

29:22.636 --> 29:25.931
What is there in a name?
Nothing.

29:26.223 --> 29:30.478
In times to come, no one will remember
Ragnar Lothbrok and his sons.

29:30.561 --> 29:32.313
They will be utterly forgotten.

29:33.647 --> 29:37.026
I can hardly remember
his name even now.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.945
Perhaps you're right.

29:40.029 --> 29:43.741
But in that case, what a poorer
place the world will be.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.370
We should always
remember Ragnar Lothbrok,

29:48.454 --> 29:50.206
even if we did not know him.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.501
Even if we only heard his
name, and do you know why?

29:54.168 --> 29:59.423
Because we are all sons of
Ragnar Lothbrok. All of us.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.009
Hmm.

30:04.261 --> 30:09.183
Think on it, Jarl Olavson.

30:10.184 --> 30:12.853
The king has shown
courage, after all.

30:14.897 --> 30:19.068
He has.
More than I expected.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.569
What happens, now?

30:22.571 --> 30:25.991
I must heed to flush out the
others who conspired against him.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.284
And against us.

30:27.910 --> 30:31.997
Alfred is not safe,
despite his courage.

30:32.957 --> 30:36.418
If Cuthred was oncethewleaden
who is their leader now?

30:36.669 --> 30:39.004
I don't know.

30:39.088 --> 30:42.550
But I'm almost certain they intended
to replace Alfred with Aethelred.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.804
But whether Aethelred is part
of the conspiracy or not,

30:46.887 --> 30:48.681
I've yet to discover.

30:57.565 --> 31:00.317
I wish I could help.

31:01.569 --> 31:06.532
Even now, the forces of Satan
are gathering to strike.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.580
That is why you are here.

31:15.624 --> 31:20.129
To help me fight
against the Devil.

31:30.639 --> 31:31.807
It's Aethelred.

31:33.809 --> 31:36.061
Come on! Come on!

32:12.097 --> 32:13.849
You wanted to speak
to me, brother?

32:13.932 --> 32:16.352
Yes, my brother.

32:16.435 --> 32:20.481
Come. Sit down. Drink. I have
some wonderful news. Great news.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.608
Isn't that right, my sweetheart?

32:22.691 --> 32:25.152
Yes, wonderful news.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.696
Come on, sit down.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.575
Sit down.

32:33.494 --> 32:36.538
So, what's the great news?
I would love some great news.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.834
Where to start.

32:42.628 --> 32:46.882
You know that our whole family is
descending from the Allfather.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.968
Yes. Yes. that is you.
That is me. too.

32:50.052 --> 32:54.348
You and me are descended from Odin.
Everyone knows that.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.976
You also remember,
when we were young,

32:58.602 --> 33:00.562
you and your brothers always

33:00.646 --> 33:04.108
made fun of me
because I was different.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.235
I don't remember me
making fun of you, Ivar.

33:06.652 --> 33:10.322
No, but you pitied me.
And I was ashamed.

33:10.948 --> 33:16.245
I hated being a cripple.
Always breaking my bones.

33:16.328 --> 33:22.543
The endless pain. I was so
angry all the time, Hvitserk.

33:22.876 --> 33:28.298
And I asked myself, why did
the gods hate me so much?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.844
Wh... Why me?

33:34.847 --> 33:37.516
And then, Freydis
explained something to me.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.853
She told me that being deformed

33:41.353 --> 33:43.897
was a sure sign
of the gods' favor.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.025
They marked me out
as a very special person.

33:47.192 --> 33:52.406
It wasn't a badge of shame,
after all. Not a curse,

33:52.489 --> 33:53.991
but a blessing.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.785
It's true. I knew that.

33:57.077 --> 33:58.787
Why are you telling me
this, Ivar?

33:58.871 --> 34:03.625
I am telling you this because
this very special person has

34:03.709 --> 34:08.338
realized something extraordinary
and astonishing about himself.

34:08.797 --> 34:12.176
It is so obvious.
Realized what?

34:12.760 --> 34:16.847
Realized that I am not just
descended from the gods.

34:16.930 --> 34:19.349
No, no, no, no.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.351
The fact is, Hvitserk,

34:21.435 --> 34:25.105
Ivar, the Boneless, is a god.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.235
He is a god.

34:30.444 --> 34:34.448
And I am carrying
his divine child.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.284
<i>You're crazy, Nat.</i>

34:37.409 --> 34:40.621
I am not crazy. I am not.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.790
That is your mistake.
I did the impossible.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.750
I am going to be a father.

34:47.461 --> 34:51.215
I am divine. And to celebrate,

34:51.381 --> 34:54.927
we will have a feast, and we will
invite everyone in Kattegat.

34:55.052 --> 34:58.639
And we will make a sacrifice
dedicated to my fellow gods,

34:58.722 --> 35:01.099
welcoming me into the family
of the Aesir.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.102
But it must be
an important sacrifice.

35:04.186 --> 35:06.605
It must be someone that
the gods will have heard of.

35:06.688 --> 35:11.151
Someone that all the people
will have heard of. Some...

35:11.235 --> 35:13.278
Someone.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.127
You don't know
what you're saying, brother.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.667
Well? What is your decision?

36:11.545 --> 36:14.840
I will raid Wessex with you.

36:15.632 --> 36:19.720
Good. Good.

36:19.803 --> 36:22.598
And, what of your
authority here?

36:23.640 --> 36:26.351
I would recognize you
as King over York,

36:26.435 --> 36:29.730
and I will no longer
feel bound to serve Ivar.

36:30.397 --> 36:34.526
In which case, you will
come with me to overthrow him,

36:34.610 --> 36:37.738
even though he is
a son of Ragnar.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.076
Show me your arm ring.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.375
Is that answer enough?

37:16.985 --> 37:19.821
Thorunn! Thorunn!

37:39.883 --> 37:42.094
She's gone.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.306
She's gone.
What do you mean. "gone"?

37:46.390 --> 37:47.557
Thorunn, she's disappeared.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.643
I don't understand.
She can't have disappeared.

37:49.726 --> 37:52.854
Mother told me she had gone
to pray at the waterfall.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.231
She felt her time was near.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.441
She wanted to pray to Freya
for a safe delivery.

37:56.525 --> 37:59.569
She wasn't there. I shouted.
I looked for her.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.530
She disappeared.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.412
Come on.
Yes. father.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.999
Oh, no. Please, please,
please, please. Please.

38:13.083 --> 38:16.169
Not your sister. Not Thorunn.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.313
You have lived your life
in the shadows.

38:35.397 --> 38:40.110
So why don't you reveal yourself,
your true identity, to Alfred.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.987
Why, he was a companion
of your youth.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.655
I'm sure he would recognize you.

38:43.739 --> 38:47.409
No, his father expelled me
from the villa.

38:47.492 --> 38:51.997
Alfred never tried to find out
what happened to me.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.167
If I was to reveal myself,
I'm sure that they'd kill me.

38:56.418 --> 38:59.337
King Ecbert and
his family betrayed me

38:59.421 --> 39:01.381
as they betrayed our father.

39:05.260 --> 39:10.265
They say that you're here
to support King Alfred.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.975
How can you do that?

39:12.893 --> 39:14.478
We are at Alfred's mercy.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.939
He should be at yours.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.234
Alfred is just as guilty as his
father and his grandfather

39:21.318 --> 39:23.487
for the death of our father.

39:40.295 --> 39:44.257
- Hail the god, Ivar.
- Hail the god, Ivar.

39:44.382 --> 39:48.094
Hail the god, Ivar.
Hail the god, Ivar.

39:48.178 --> 39:51.556
- Hail the god, Ivar.
- Hail the god, Ivar.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.816
Move! Get out!

40:04.444 --> 40:07.113
Move! Move!

40:07.197 --> 40:09.074
Come on!

40:09.157 --> 40:12.452
And, you! Go!
Go! Move!

41:00.417 --> 41:02.419
Kneel before the god, Ivar.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.421
Kneel down.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.759
- Bow your heads.
- On your knees.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.638
Bow to god Ivar!

42:32.467 --> 42:35.595
Bring out the sacrifice!

42:38.848 --> 42:40.600
<i>N an!</i>

42:43.895 --> 42:47.023
Hail Ivar!

43:01.121 --> 43:04.040
<i>Nan!</i>

43:10.422 --> 43:14.134
<i>Nan Ha“ Nan!</i>

43:31.651 --> 43:33.069
<i>Nan!</i>
