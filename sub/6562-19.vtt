- [laughs]
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.400
HEY, LISTEN.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.200
IT HAS BEEN GREAT DATING YOU,

09:55.200 --> 09:56.733
BUT HERE COMES
THE AWKWARD PART.

09:56.733 --> 09:59.600
- RIGHT, GOT IT.
I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.367
- EXACTLY!
WAIT, WHAT?

10:01.367 --> 10:02.800
IT SOUNDED LIKE
YOU SAID YOU'RE...

10:02.800 --> 10:03.967
- BREAKING UP WITH YOU?

10:03.967 --> 10:05.600
- NO!
NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

10:05.600 --> 10:06.967
- THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANTED HER TO DO.

10:06.967 --> 10:09.033
- BUT I'M SUPPOSED
TO BREAK UP WITH HER.

10:09.033 --> 10:12.567
NO ONE DUMPS JAMES DIAMOND.
I'VE NEVER BEEN DUMPED.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.567
- AND NOW YOU HAVE.

10:14.567 --> 10:16.733
- YOU'RE RUINING MY PERFECT
NEVER-BEEN-DUMPED RECORD.

10:16.733 --> 10:18.267
- WELL, I'VE NEVER
BEEN DUMPED EITHER,

10:18.267 --> 10:20.400
AND YOU'RE NOT RUINING
MY PERFECT RECORD.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.700
- NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE NOT--

10:23.700 --> 10:27.567
WAIT, DON'T GO!
JENNIFER, DON'T LEAVE ME!

10:27.567 --> 10:29.267
- [crying]

10:29.267 --> 10:30.567
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY.

10:30.567 --> 10:34.133
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.833
- WHAT IS IT YOU TWO
ARE GOING THROUGH?

10:35.833 --> 10:37.600
- THE RED-SHIRTED GIRL.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.500
IT WAS THE GREATEST
12 MINUTES OF MY LIFE.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.700
AND NOW SHE'S GONE.
SHE'S GONE, I TELL YOU!

10:43.700 --> 10:44.733
[both crying]

10:44.733 --> 10:47.933
- PAIN, IT HURTS SO REAL.

10:47.933 --> 10:50.933
- HEY, GUYS, I AM SORRY
FOR SNAPPING AT YOU EARLIER--

10:50.933 --> 10:53.867
[both wailing]

10:56.067 --> 10:57.633
- DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU STARTED?

11:02.433 --> 11:05.667
[both moaning]

11:05.667 --> 11:06.967
- WHAT HAPPENED?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.667
- WELL, YOU TOLD US
WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND

11:08.667 --> 11:09.867
WHAT YOU WERE GOING THROUGH,

11:09.867 --> 11:11.333
AND SO WE ALL WENT OUT
WITH GIRLS,

11:11.333 --> 11:13.833
AND THEIRS CLEARLY
ENDED WORSE THAN MINE.

11:13.833 --> 11:15.967
AND IF WE DON'T GET THEM TO SING
ON THE SUMMER SINGLE,

11:15.967 --> 11:17.833
THEN GRIFFIN'S
GONNA "OR ELSE" US.

11:17.833 --> 11:21.100
- NOW MY PERFECT RECORD IS GONE.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.633
WHY COULDN'T YOU LET US IN?

11:23.633 --> 11:26.767
- I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU,
RED-SHIRTED GIRL.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.067
- DUDE, WAIT.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.533
WHY AREN'T YOU FACEDOWN
ON THE COUCH ANYMORE?

11:29.533 --> 11:31.833
- WELL, YOU GUYS TOLD ME
TO GET MY MIND OFF JO.

11:31.833 --> 11:34.800
AND YOU GUYS DID HELP ME
GET MY MIND OFF JO.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.500
BUT NOW I'VE SAID "JO"
THREE TIMES,

11:36.500 --> 11:38.167
AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE--

11:38.167 --> 11:39.733
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
OH, OKAY.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.700
NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.067
THINK ABOUT THEM AND NOT JO.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.567
NOW, HOW ARE WE
GONNA FIX THIS?

11:43.567 --> 11:44.900
[both crying]

11:44.900 --> 11:47.500
- BY REMEMBERING
WHAT YOU GUYS TOLD ME.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.800
WE'RE SINGLE NOW,
AND WE CAN DO ALL THE COOL STUFF

11:50.800 --> 11:53.067
WE USED TO DO
BEFORE WE WERE IN RELATIONSHIPS.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.733
AND WE CAN
GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

11:57.067 --> 11:58.767
YEAH!
THE BOYS ARE BACK!

11:58.767 --> 12:03.067
- THIS IS HOW WE ROLL!
WHOO!

12:03.067 --> 12:07.500
[both crying]

12:07.500 --> 12:09.333
- YEAH, THIS IS GONNA BE
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.767
- YEP.
AGAIN!

12:17.233 --> 12:19.567
- I'M NOT POSITIVE,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

12:19.567 --> 12:21.900
I'M NOT CONNECTING
WITH THESE TEENS.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.367
- OH, WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

12:27.067 --> 12:30.200
- THAT'S IT!
YOU FAILED.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.500
I'M RETURNING THE JACKET.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.500
- LEAVE THE JACKET OUT OF THIS.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.067
AND TEENS THESE DAYS
AREN'T GOING TO GIVE YOU

12:37.067 --> 12:40.333
ANY CREDIBILITY
UNTIL YOU ESTABLISH...

12:40.333 --> 12:42.300
YOUR SHRED ABILITY.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.267
- OKAY, DO NOT DO THAT.

12:46.367 --> 12:48.800
- MAKE WAY!
O.M.G!

12:48.800 --> 12:50.467
BIEBER!

12:50.467 --> 12:54.667
[loud crash]

12:54.667 --> 12:57.600
- GUSTAVO, ARE YOU OKAY?

12:57.600 --> 13:01.100
- [high pitched]
I'M ONLY 3 1/2 YEARS OLD.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.067
[blubbers]

13:05.467 --> 13:08.400
- FINE, I'LL CONNECT
WITH THE TEENS.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.733
TELL ME, TEENS, WHAT'S ON YOUR
MIND AS SUMMER APPROACHES?

13:11.733 --> 13:14.700
- OH, WE ALL JUST WENT THROUGH
SOME PRETTY WEIRD BREAKUPS.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.233
all: REALLY WEIRD.

13:16.233 --> 13:18.700
- MINE LASTED 12 MINUTES.

13:18.700 --> 13:21.400
- THAT'S IT!
A BREAKUP SONG.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.067
WE ALL GO THROUGH THEM,
SO EVERYONE CAN RELATE.

13:25.067 --> 13:27.867
GET GRIFFIN AND THE DOGS
TO THE STUDIO RIGHT NOW,

13:27.867 --> 13:29.667
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
THE SUMMER SINGLE

13:29.667 --> 13:31.667
THAT'S GOING TO RULE THE WORLD.

13:33.633 --> 13:36.100
- * SHE'S GONE FOREVER *

13:36.100 --> 13:40.667
- * BUT I'LL NEVER
FORGET HER FACE *

13:40.667 --> 13:43.767
- [crying]
* SHE SAID IT WAS OVER

13:43.767 --> 13:46.633
- * AND SHE MOVED SO FAR AWAY

13:46.633 --> 13:49.067
all: [wailing]
* AND IT'S OVER *

13:49.067 --> 13:51.100
*IT'S OVER *

13:51.100 --> 13:54.667
- OKAY, GUSTAVO, SERIOUSLY?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.767
NO, KENDALL, COME ON.
STAY WITH ME.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.633
- I DON'T LIKE IT, GUSTAVO.

14:00.633 --> 14:02.833
AND I SAID I WANTED
MY HIT SUMMER SONG TODAY,

14:02.833 --> 14:04.333
OR ELSE.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.100
- GRIFFIN,
I JUST NEED MORE TIME.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.067
- SO NOW I'M GIVING
ALL THE MONEY

14:11.067 --> 14:12.367
TO MARKET YOUR SUMMER SINGLE

14:12.367 --> 14:14.167
TO OUR SUMMER SNACK FOOD
DIVISION

14:14.167 --> 14:17.433
SO THEY CAN LAUNCH THEIR
JUST-INVENTED "YO-BLOW,"

14:17.433 --> 14:19.367
THE YOGURT
YOU CAN BLOW BUBBLES WITH.

14:19.367 --> 14:24.867
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT WORKS,
AND, FRANKLY, I DON'T WANT TO.

14:24.867 --> 14:26.533
- GRIFFIN, WE CAN GET YOU
THAT SINGLE.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.333
WE JUST NEED MORE TIME.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.200
- THEY'VE NEVER LET YOU DOWN,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.933
- KATIE, I LIKE YOUR JACKET.

14:33.933 --> 14:36.500
SO YOU GET ONE MORE DAY
TO GIVE ME A SUMMER SINGLE

14:36.500 --> 14:39.133
WITH THE WORD "BEACH" IN IT
THAT RULES THE WORLD,

14:39.133 --> 14:42.600
OR YOU ALL GET YO-BLOW.

14:47.267 --> 14:49.733
- YOU TWO, GET THOSE TWO
OFF THE GROUND

14:49.733 --> 14:53.200
AND GET THEM TO STOP
BLUBBERING SO THEY CAN SING.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.067
- GOT IT.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.300
- IF I COULD JUST SEE HER--

14:56.300 --> 15:00.233
- AND YOU,
FIX MY WRITER'S BLOCK!

15:03.100 --> 15:05.867
[both crying]

15:05.867 --> 15:07.867
- OKAY, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

15:07.867 --> 15:09.333
- OWN IT!

15:09.333 --> 15:10.333
- NO!

15:10.333 --> 15:11.700
TAKE CARLOS.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.200
FIND THE RED-SHIRTED GIRL
SO HE CAN SEE HER ONE LAST TIME.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.267
- JUST ONE MORE TIME.

15:16.267 --> 15:17.633
- RIGHT.

15:17.633 --> 15:19.300
YOU TAKE JAMES TO FIND JENNIFER,

15:19.300 --> 15:20.800
AND YOU GET HER
TO GO OUT WITH HIM AGAIN.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.600
- SO HE CAN BREAK UP
WITH HER THIS TIME.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.267
- [crying]
THAT MIGHT WORK.

15:24.267 --> 15:27.800
both: MOVE OUT!

15:31.733 --> 15:35.067
- OKAY, YOU SAID YOU SAW
THE RED-SHIRT GIRL IN THE PARK.

15:39.900 --> 15:43.767
- [crying]
BUT NOW I DON'T!

15:43.767 --> 15:45.267
- OKAY, OKAY.

15:45.267 --> 15:47.767
WHAT ELSE DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT HER?

15:47.767 --> 15:51.800
- WELL, SHE SMELLED LIKE...

15:51.800 --> 15:54.867
LIKE...

15:54.867 --> 15:58.100
LIKE CHILI CHEESE FRIES!

15:58.100 --> 16:00.400
- NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.300
SHE MUST HAVE HAD
THE CHILI CHEESE FRIES

16:02.300 --> 16:04.600
DELIVERED FROM
THAT NEW CHILI CHEESE FACTORY.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.967
- CAN WE GET SOME?
THEY SMELL REALLY GOOD.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.467
- NOPE.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.667
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CHECK
THE PALMWOODS SIGN-IN BOOK

16:10.667 --> 16:13.067
TO SEE WHICH APARTMENTS
HAD CHILI CHEESE FRIES DELIVERED

16:13.067 --> 16:15.967
THEN CHECK THOSE APARTMENTS
AND FIND YOUR GIRL.

16:15.967 --> 16:17.400
- YES!
- WHOO!

16:17.400 --> 16:21.200
- HERE WE COME,
RED-SHIRTED GIRL!

16:21.200 --> 16:24.100
- * CHILI CHEESE
IN THE SUMMER BREEZE *

16:24.100 --> 16:26.967
* MAKING ME SNEEZE AND...

16:26.967 --> 16:28.333
- THAT WAS AWFUL.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.067
- REALLY, REALLY BAD.

16:30.067 --> 16:31.067
- TO THE POOL!

16:32.467 --> 16:35.400
- IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF FUNNY
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.567
JUST GO BACK OUT WITH JAMES
SO HE CAN DUMP YOU THIS TIME.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.767
all: FORGET IT.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.967
- GUYS, COME ON.
HE'S A TOTAL WRECK.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.633
- [crying]
THIS WAS NOT THE PLAN!

16:46.633 --> 16:48.467
- YOUR PLAN WAS STUPID.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.700
- YOU'RE STUPID!

16:49.700 --> 16:51.267
- SEE, THIS IS WHY
I BROKE UP WITH HIM.

16:51.267 --> 16:53.867
- AH, YOU!

16:56.567 --> 16:58.833
- HEY, IF YOU EVER WANT
TO GO OUT WITH HER AGAIN,

16:58.833 --> 17:01.067
THEN YOU'LL STOP ALL OF THIS
AND TURN ON

17:01.067 --> 17:04.333
THAT GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
JAMES DIAMOND CHARM.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.567
- I'LL NEED A TUXEDO.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.300
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

17:08.300 --> 17:11.067
- * A TUXEDO
WOULD BE NEAT-O *

17:11.067 --> 17:12.467
* SOMETHING ELSE-O

17:12.467 --> 17:15.233
*AND THE WORD "BEACH" *

17:15.233 --> 17:16.167
DARN IT!

17:19.767 --> 17:22.067
- OKAY, THIS HAS TO BE HER.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.200
IT'S THE LAST APARTMENT

17:23.200 --> 17:24.833
THAT HAD CHILI CHEESE FRIES
DELIVERED.

17:24.833 --> 17:26.667
- OH, THAT'S IT!

17:34.633 --> 17:37.067
- PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S NOT HER.

17:41.167 --> 17:45.800
- OH!
I'LL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.300
- THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.900
WE'VE CHECKED EVERY SINGLE
APARTMENT THAT GOT A DELIVERY.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.300
WAIT, I'M SMART.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.633
- [moans]

17:52.633 --> 17:55.067
- CARLOS, YOU DOWN
FOR SOME CHILI CHEESE FRIES?

17:55.067 --> 17:58.433
- [crying]
WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?

18:01.400 --> 18:03.133
- OKAY, YOU LOOK GREAT.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.700
NOW GO OVER THERE,
TURN ON THE CHARM...

18:05.700 --> 18:07.200
AND NOT THE YELLING AT HER!

18:07.200 --> 18:12.433
- GOT IT.
CHARM, NO YELLING.

18:12.433 --> 18:16.600
WHY WON'T YOU GO OUT
WITH ME AGAIN?

18:16.600 --> 18:20.067
- * WHY WON'T YOU
GO OUT WITH ME AGAIN? *

18:20.067 --> 18:21.867
- JAMES, STOP IT.
STOP IT!

18:21.867 --> 18:24.600
- * JAMES, STOP IT,
STOP IT, STOP IT *

18:24.600 --> 18:27.367
- NOW, ONE OF YOU
SAY THE WORD "BEACH."

18:27.367 --> 18:29.433
- IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN,
OKAY?

18:29.433 --> 18:30.533
- AH!

18:30.533 --> 18:32.533
both: SHE DUMPED YOU.
DEAL WITH IT.

18:36.267 --> 18:37.667
- JENNIFER, PLEASE.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.500
WE NEED JAMES TO SING
ON OUR SUMMER SINGLE,

18:39.500 --> 18:41.900
AND HE CAN'T SING LIKE THAT.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.067
- [groans]

18:43.067 --> 18:45.767
- LOOK, EVERYBODY
HAS THEIR PRICE.

18:45.767 --> 18:47.767
SO WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE
FOR YOU TO TAKE JAMES BACK

18:47.767 --> 18:49.867
SO HE CAN DUMP YOU?

18:49.867 --> 18:51.067
- I WANT THE JACKET.

18:51.067 --> 18:52.400
- WHAT? THERE IS NO WAY
I'M GIVING--

18:52.400 --> 18:55.733
- KATIE, GIVE HER THE JACKET!

18:55.733 --> 18:58.600
- TAKE IT.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.733
- AND NOW,
WILL YOU TAKE ME BACK?

19:01.733 --> 19:02.967
- YES.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.600
- I'M DUMPING YOU!

19:04.600 --> 19:05.733
all: WE KNOW.

19:07.167 --> 19:08.333
[all snap]

19:09.533 --> 19:12.200
- ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT JAMES BACK.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.533
- BUT I STILL DON'T HAVE
MY SUMMER SINGLE

19:14.533 --> 19:16.167
THAT RULES THE WORLD.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.800
- JUST CALL THE SONG
RULE THE WORLD,

19:18.800 --> 19:21.067
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS

19:21.067 --> 19:22.500
OR GIRLS IN IT,

19:22.500 --> 19:24.200
AND INSTEAD OF SLOW
AND EMOTIONAL,

19:24.200 --> 19:27.400
MAKE IT FAST AND DANCEABLE.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.267
- KATIE, IT IS NOT THAT EASY.

19:29.267 --> 19:32.767
WAIT A SECOND.
I'M AMAZING.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.300
- WHOO-HOO!

19:34.300 --> 19:37.400
GUSTAVO ROCQUE
HAS A SUMMER SINGLE!

19:37.400 --> 19:40.833
NOW ALL I NEED
IS A HAPPY CARLOS!

19:40.833 --> 19:42.400
- [groans]

19:42.400 --> 19:45.100
- NO HAPPY CARLOS.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.067
- [groans]

19:48.067 --> 19:50.067
- BUT ONLY FOR A SECOND,

19:50.067 --> 19:53.133
BECAUSE I ORDERED HIM
CHILI CHEESE FRIES.

19:53.133 --> 19:55.567
