WEBVTT

00:03.426 --> 00:05.327
Wow! Look at you..

00:05.361 --> 00:07.401
You got that whole Barbara
Stanwyck thing going on.

00:07.402 --> 00:09.088
You look great.
Too bad the guy's dead.

00:09.089 --> 00:10.489
He's not even
gonna be able to see you.

00:10.523 --> 00:11.790
I'd actually prefer
to wear white.

00:11.825 --> 00:13.640
White? You wear white
to weddings, Bones.

00:13.641 --> 00:15.308
You wear white
to an Asian

00:15.343 --> 00:16.743
or Hindu funeral.

00:16.778 --> 00:18.512
I can't believe
we actually have to go

00:18.546 --> 00:19.746
to this thing.

00:19.781 --> 00:21.815
There's a huge Flyers game on

00:21.849 --> 00:23.517
today that I have
to see.

00:23.551 --> 00:26.553
My research benefited
from Mr. Mirga's donations.

00:26.587 --> 00:29.623
He financed digs
in the Middle East and Africa.

00:29.657 --> 00:32.025
That doesn't matter. You don't
even know this guy, okay?

00:32.058 --> 00:33.527
We know the Flyers.

00:33.561 --> 00:36.029
I love the Flyers, okay?
It's a big game.

00:36.063 --> 00:37.864
I'm still grateful
for his support,

00:37.899 --> 00:40.500
and I would like to pay my
respects to him and his family.

00:40.535 --> 00:43.236
You're the one who said I
should be more empathetic.

00:43.271 --> 00:45.438
Ho, ho, ho. So
it's my fault now.

00:45.473 --> 00:47.607
Yes.
Oh, ho. Wow.

00:47.642 --> 00:50.277
I don't see how someone so
rich could O.D. on heroin.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.279
Oh, you get
a syringe and heroin,

00:52.313 --> 00:54.247
you tie off the upper part
of the arm,

00:54.282 --> 00:55.682
insert the needle
into the vein.

00:55.716 --> 00:57.584
Bones, I think I can
figure that out.

00:57.618 --> 00:59.519
Okay? All right.
No tribal music.

00:59.554 --> 01:02.189
I want to hear pregame
on the way over, okay?

01:07.795 --> 01:10.230
Wow. This place is fancy.

01:10.264 --> 01:12.632
Are you watching the game?
Yeah. Guy's got great Wi-Fi here.

01:12.667 --> 01:14.534
And he should if he's
worth $3 billion.

01:14.569 --> 01:16.803
This kind of wealth
is quite difficult to achieve.

01:16.838 --> 01:19.706
Wait a second. You achieve,
okay? He ran a hedge fund.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.041
Guy probably paid off
his congressman

01:21.075 --> 01:23.443
so he'd pay less tax
than his secretary.

01:23.477 --> 01:25.612
I wouldn't bring
that up here, Booth.

01:25.646 --> 01:27.280
Oh!

01:29.116 --> 01:30.317
Booth.
Sorry.

01:30.351 --> 01:31.852
My son was a good man,

01:31.886 --> 01:35.155
but in pain-- a pain a mother
will carry to her grave.

01:35.189 --> 01:36.790
Must be Mirga's mother.

01:37.859 --> 01:39.125
Mrs. Mirga,

01:39.160 --> 01:41.328
I would like to extend
my condolences.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.896
I'm Temperance Brennan.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.698
Another one of his women.

01:44.732 --> 01:47.500
We should have a special section
for whores.

01:47.535 --> 01:49.069
I beg your pardon?
Whoa.

01:49.103 --> 01:50.303
Watch it, okay? You know what,

01:50.338 --> 01:51.705
she's a doctor
at the Jeffersonian.

01:51.739 --> 01:53.473
Plus, she's my wife.

01:53.507 --> 01:56.743
And she's a brain surgeon.
You all ruined my son.

01:56.777 --> 01:59.179
Stop it. Now.
This is the last one.

01:59.213 --> 02:01.681
You probably killed him,
hoping to get his money.

02:01.716 --> 02:04.117
Please, Mrs. Mirga. We're here
to honor your son, not...

02:04.151 --> 02:05.652
They took my son away from me.

02:05.686 --> 02:07.254
He lives on
with God, Mrs. Mirga,

02:07.288 --> 02:08.520
and in our hearts.

02:08.556 --> 02:10.323
They poison him
against his own mother.

02:10.358 --> 02:12.092
Easy, Mrs. Mirga.

02:12.126 --> 02:13.793
Wow, you're right.

02:13.828 --> 02:15.128
This funeral's more
exciting than this game.

02:15.162 --> 02:17.197
They're of Romany ancestry.

02:17.231 --> 02:18.531
A very passionate people.

02:20.134 --> 02:22.535
Todd?

02:22.570 --> 02:24.838
Todd?

02:27.942 --> 02:29.209
Okay, everybody out.

02:30.878 --> 02:32.913
Get out! Now!

02:34.815 --> 02:36.950
Wait a second.
You're supposed to be dead.

02:36.984 --> 02:38.385
Well, that's not true, is it?

02:38.419 --> 02:39.786
Booth,

02:39.820 --> 02:44.224
if Todd is here, then...
who is in the urn?

02:50.831 --> 02:52.565
How would I know
who's in the urn?

02:52.600 --> 02:53.867
Anyone you know missing?

02:53.901 --> 02:57.070
I'm kind of a
well-known recluse.

02:57.104 --> 02:58.872
And I just got back into town;
that's how I heard

02:58.906 --> 03:00.807
about my funeral.
Hmm, all this media coverage,

03:00.841 --> 03:02.676
I'm surprised you haven't
heard of this before today.

03:02.710 --> 03:04.811
I was in a drug rehab facility.

03:04.845 --> 03:06.313
No phones, no TVs.

03:06.347 --> 03:07.480
That's correct.

03:07.515 --> 03:08.548
And it's in Costa Rica.

03:08.582 --> 03:09.783
I didn't use my real name.

03:09.817 --> 03:11.151
You can check it out.

03:11.185 --> 03:12.619
Oh, we will.

03:12.653 --> 03:13.813
So, why all the secrecy then?

03:13.821 --> 03:14.888
I run a hedge fund.

03:14.922 --> 03:16.189
It's better if my investors

03:16.223 --> 03:18.758
didn't find out
I was a drug addict.

03:18.793 --> 03:21.761
I guess it's too late
for that now.

03:21.796 --> 03:23.863
You guys couldn't tell
who it was by looking at him?

03:23.898 --> 03:26.466
You know what? Maybe you can
help us out with that.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.801
Hmm? Take a look at these.

03:27.835 --> 03:29.169
Here you go.

03:29.203 --> 03:31.604
After three weeks,
the body swells,

03:31.639 --> 03:33.773
becoming unrecognizable.

03:33.808 --> 03:35.909
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

03:35.943 --> 03:38.445
Because he was found
in your place with no evidence

03:38.479 --> 03:39.479
of foul play...

03:39.513 --> 03:41.114
Just the drugs.
Exactly.

03:41.148 --> 03:42.515
The assumption was
that you had O.D.'d.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.284
And since the coroner ruled it

03:44.318 --> 03:46.286
an accidental death,
they closed the case.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.388
We reopened it.
I understand.

03:48.422 --> 03:52.192
If there's anything I can do,
please let me know.

03:55.329 --> 03:57.530
Michelle showed me the bracelet
you bought her, Finn.

03:57.565 --> 03:59.466
A little extravagant,
don't you think?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.968
I've never been able to buy
anybody a real gift before.

04:02.003 --> 04:03.770
I'm just sharing
the wealth.

04:03.804 --> 04:06.272
Well, that's very sweet,
but don't go overboard.

04:06.307 --> 04:08.875
It can disappear
as quickly as it came.

04:08.909 --> 04:10.777
Not so sure. Opie and
Thurston's Hot Sauce

04:10.811 --> 04:12.212
is going national.

04:12.246 --> 04:14.481
I got a check for
$19,000 the other day.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.016
That's more money than
my family's made in a year.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.617
Opie,

04:17.651 --> 04:19.452
it is good to see you.
You, too, Thurston.

04:19.487 --> 04:21.154
Welcome back, Mr. Abernathy.

04:21.188 --> 04:23.990
I trust you enjoyed
your studies in Boston?

04:24.025 --> 04:26.326
That I did, ma'am, with
a little money in my pocket.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.660
I even ate a restaurant
where I didn't understand

04:27.695 --> 04:28.795
one word on the menu.

04:28.829 --> 04:30.697
Oh, that's wonderful.

04:30.731 --> 04:32.499
That's how I tasted
my first tarantula.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.168
Okay. Let's shift the focus
from the benefits of wealth

04:35.202 --> 04:36.836
to the task at hand, shall we?

04:36.871 --> 04:40.673
The remains were discovered
locked in the safe room

04:40.708 --> 04:42.208
of Todd Mirga's house.

04:42.243 --> 04:44.911
Decomp suggests
about three weeks after death.

04:44.945 --> 04:47.080
Ooh, a safe room;
now that would be sweet.

04:47.114 --> 04:49.716
Mr. Abernathy, if your focus is
now the accumulation of money,

04:49.750 --> 04:51.885
I can always get another intern.

04:51.919 --> 04:53.386
Uh, no, ma'am.

04:53.421 --> 04:54.754
I'm-I'm sorry, ma'am.

04:54.789 --> 04:55.955
So we have someone

04:55.990 --> 04:57.924
dead of unknown causes,

04:57.958 --> 05:00.393
locked in a safe room
for three weeks.

05:00.428 --> 05:02.762
No I.D.
No idea if it's murder or accidental.

05:02.797 --> 05:06.099
Exactly. Fortunately,
we have the remains.

05:07.968 --> 05:09.135
Oh.

05:09.170 --> 05:10.637
You can't just pour it in there.

05:10.671 --> 05:12.605
The ash is gonna fly all over.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.674
No, there's an electrostatic
trap in the tray.

05:14.708 --> 05:17.243
So, no particle,
no matter how small,

05:17.278 --> 05:19.846
can escape.

05:23.551 --> 05:24.951
Perfect.

05:24.985 --> 05:27.387
These should tell us
all we need to know.

05:29.557 --> 05:31.291
I think Angie's
going to have trouble

05:31.325 --> 05:33.359
doing the facial reconstruction.

♪

06:04.613 --> 06:06.922
It's like trying to rebuild
a pig after a barbeque.

06:06.923 --> 06:08.524
Well, hardly,
Mr. Abernathy.

06:08.558 --> 06:10.059
That would require tissue
that would've been

06:10.093 --> 06:11.327
consumed during the meal.

06:11.361 --> 06:13.062
In my experience,
bone fragments

06:13.096 --> 06:15.498
from a cremation are
usually much smaller.

06:15.532 --> 06:18.034
Fortunately for us,
the crematorium did

06:18.068 --> 06:20.136
a completely inept job.

06:20.170 --> 06:21.871
there might be
some charred tissue for me.

06:21.905 --> 06:25.708
The shape and thickness
of this fragment

06:25.742 --> 06:28.177
suggests that it came
from the victim's ilium.

06:28.211 --> 06:31.747
The textured
lip indicates

06:31.782 --> 06:33.683
that he was in his mid-30s.

06:33.717 --> 06:35.017
Which explains
why he could've

06:35.052 --> 06:36.719
been mistaken for Todd Mirga.

06:36.753 --> 06:40.890
I think I found a pretty
good-sized piece of something.

06:40.924 --> 06:42.024
That seems to be
a bit of mandible.

06:42.059 --> 06:43.326
Mm-hmm.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.961
I have a fragment of sternum.

06:45.996 --> 06:48.664
Let me see.

06:50.734 --> 06:52.735
That's impossible.

06:52.769 --> 06:55.638
I already retrieved this
section of the sternum.

07:01.545 --> 07:03.646
Oh, my God.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.148
We have two sets of remains.

07:06.183 --> 07:07.783
I mean, aren't
these places regulated?

07:07.818 --> 07:11.387
Only by the EPA, and they
mostly care about emissions.

07:11.421 --> 07:13.756
The degree of ossification
on this sternal fragment

07:13.790 --> 07:15.991
is from somebody
in their mid to late 70s.

07:16.026 --> 07:19.128
I have a tooth fragment here.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.768
Absence of
staining, attrition

07:25.802 --> 07:28.404
and cementum apposition

07:28.438 --> 07:30.606
suggests it's from
a 20-year-old.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.575
We have three sets of remains?

07:32.609 --> 07:34.210
And we've barely started
sifting through all this.

07:34.244 --> 07:35.444
There could be more.

07:35.479 --> 07:37.747
Well, how are we gonna
I.D. the victim?

07:37.781 --> 07:41.050
I have no idea, but it's
quite an exciting challenge.

07:43.387 --> 07:45.454
One urn, three sets of remains.

07:45.489 --> 07:47.423
How does a billionaire end
up at a budget mortuary?

07:47.457 --> 07:49.692
Mother took care of it.
I saw her at the funeral.

07:49.726 --> 07:50.893
She's a piece of work.

07:50.927 --> 07:52.795
So, all of the employees
at his estate,

07:52.829 --> 07:54.730
everyone that works for him,
they're all accounted for?

07:54.765 --> 07:56.198
Yeah.
You know, I was looking

07:56.233 --> 07:58.100
at Mirga today,
and I'm thinking to myself

07:58.135 --> 08:00.136
this guy's got everything;
why's he shooting up heroin?

08:00.170 --> 08:01.237
It's an addictive personality.

08:01.271 --> 08:03.539
Right? For you,
it was gambling.

08:03.573 --> 08:05.274
For him, it was drugs.
Probably other vices, too.

08:05.308 --> 08:06.709
But still,
he became a billionaire.

08:06.743 --> 08:08.511
My guess? Because of his
addictive personality.

08:08.545 --> 08:10.446
Look, he was addicted
to money, too.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.615
Well, everyone sort of is, aren't they?
No, not like this.

08:12.649 --> 08:14.183
Addiction is
about power and control.

08:14.217 --> 08:15.785
For someone like Todd,

08:15.819 --> 08:17.119
money and drugs serve
the same purpose.

08:17.154 --> 08:18.287
Yeah, but an addict
will do anything

08:18.321 --> 08:20.222
to get his next fix.
Seems as though

08:20.257 --> 08:24.860
our John Doe here got between
Todd and his money, huh?

08:27.931 --> 08:29.565
Thank you, Mr. Domick.
All right, now,

08:29.599 --> 08:31.734
this is everything that
Church Falls PD dropped off.

08:31.768 --> 08:33.369
Why did they vacuum
the crime scene

08:33.403 --> 08:35.037
if they didn't
suspect a murder?

08:35.071 --> 08:37.239
Well, the techs at the scene
were just going by the book.

08:37.274 --> 08:39.041
They've never
been opened.

08:39.075 --> 08:41.277
Wow, this is the first evidence
we've had in a long time

08:41.311 --> 08:42.711
that hasn't been contaminated.

08:42.746 --> 08:44.814
Ah, you hope.

08:44.848 --> 08:46.582
Hey, I bought a truck.

08:46.616 --> 08:48.117
Brand-new--
well, sort of.

08:48.151 --> 08:49.552
It's only got
12,000 miles on it.

08:49.586 --> 08:51.454
But I can't wait
to show Michelle.

08:51.488 --> 08:53.255
Don't you think you should wait
until more money comes in

08:53.290 --> 08:54.824
before you start blowing it all?

08:54.858 --> 08:56.358
No, the sales projections
for our hot sauce

08:56.393 --> 08:58.627
is brighter than
the sun in August.

08:58.662 --> 09:00.830
Projections are
not cash, Opie.

09:00.864 --> 09:03.032
Hey, the syringe has
never been used.

09:03.066 --> 09:05.668
But the coroner ruled the
victim's death an overdose.

09:05.702 --> 09:07.837
Yeah, well, assumptions,

09:07.871 --> 09:10.673
they can always
obscure the truth.

09:13.577 --> 09:15.211
Oh, I was under
the impression

09:15.245 --> 09:16.979
that you'd I.D.'d the victim.

09:17.013 --> 09:18.113
I'm about to.

09:18.148 --> 09:19.915
Well, the sooner,
the better.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.851
This may be all we have.
So, we know the victim

09:21.885 --> 09:24.019
was locked in Todd's safe room
for three weeks.

09:24.054 --> 09:27.189
So, I created
a regressive algorithm

09:27.224 --> 09:29.525
that factors in humidity
and temperature

09:29.559 --> 09:31.627
against stages of decomp.

09:31.661 --> 09:33.896
How could you know
the humidity and temperature?

09:33.930 --> 09:35.531
Well, luckily,
the room had a hygrometer

09:35.565 --> 09:37.366
and a humidifier,

09:37.400 --> 09:38.934
an independent thermostat,

09:38.969 --> 09:40.736
motion sensors
and a CO2 scrubber.

09:40.770 --> 09:44.640
Wow, Todd's money seems to be
funding our investigation.

09:44.674 --> 09:46.275
So, that data
and your algorithm

09:46.309 --> 09:49.879
allow you to reverse
the decomposition?

09:49.913 --> 09:51.614
Yeah.

09:54.317 --> 09:57.186
Wow. That is amazing.

09:57.220 --> 09:58.187
I know, right?

09:58.221 --> 09:59.889
Okay, I'll start with DMV.

10:02.692 --> 10:04.660
There weren't any security cameras on?
No.

10:04.694 --> 10:06.262
And Todd was out of town,

10:06.296 --> 10:07.930
so he doesn't know
why the cameras were turned off.

10:07.964 --> 10:10.533
Was there a break-in?
Was anything missing?

10:10.567 --> 10:13.335
No, nothing reported.

10:15.372 --> 10:16.839
Oh, match found.

10:16.873 --> 10:19.341
Daniel Barr.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.014
You sure it's Daniel?
Yes.

10:25.048 --> 10:26.916
There were two teeth

10:26.950 --> 10:29.652
in the cremator remains-- enough
for me to confirm his identity.

10:29.686 --> 10:30.986
All you needed was two teeth?

10:31.021 --> 10:32.821
The second one was
actually unnecessary.

10:32.856 --> 10:34.790
So, Daniel Barr had
an I.D. card

10:34.824 --> 10:36.325
that gave him access
to your home,

10:36.359 --> 10:37.593
but he wasn't an employee
of yours,

10:37.627 --> 10:39.194
so what exactly did he do
for you?

10:39.229 --> 10:42.064
Daniel was
my personal concierge.

10:42.098 --> 10:43.766
You know, lifestyle management.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.834
No, I don't know.

10:45.869 --> 10:47.536
I manage my own lifestyle.

10:47.571 --> 10:51.006
He did things like
book my trip to Antarctica,

10:51.041 --> 10:54.276
set up a carnival for a party,
acquired some antiquities.

10:54.311 --> 10:56.045
He helped spend your billions.

10:56.079 --> 10:58.647
Rich people are always
criticized for their success.

10:58.682 --> 11:01.183
We do a lot for this country.
Nobody seems to talk about that.

11:01.217 --> 11:03.052
Maybe he got tired
of buying your toys

11:03.086 --> 11:05.588
and he wanted
toys of his own.

11:05.622 --> 11:06.755
What are you saying?

11:06.790 --> 11:09.358
I'm pretty sure that was clear.

11:09.392 --> 11:10.943
Daniel was my friend.
I don't hurt my friends.

11:10.968 --> 11:11.860
Really?

11:11.861 --> 11:13.662
What about Anthony Shelton?
Does that name ring a bell?

11:13.697 --> 11:15.731
You fired Shelton,

11:15.765 --> 11:17.633
had him blacklisted.
You ruined him.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.034
That was business.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.070
He blew a deal
that cost me a lot of money.

11:21.104 --> 11:24.573
Because no one messes with
your money, isn't that right?

11:26.242 --> 11:28.611
Your theory of my motive
is fascinating,

11:28.645 --> 11:29.912
but very difficult to prove.

11:29.946 --> 11:31.914
I was in Costa Rica,
remember?

11:36.716 --> 11:39.117
Any luck with the evidence
from Church Falls PD?

11:39.151 --> 11:40.618
Yeah. Take a look
at this.

11:40.653 --> 11:42.153
It's like a treasure trove
of goodies.

11:42.188 --> 11:44.322
What-what am I looking at?
It's soil.

11:44.357 --> 11:48.059
Right, okay, so the red,
gray and white particulates

11:48.094 --> 11:51.663
indicate a very arid,
saline environment.

11:51.697 --> 11:54.466
Now, these crystals are selenite
gypsum found in salt flats,

11:54.500 --> 11:56.067
but these crystals are arsenic.

11:56.102 --> 11:57.535
Arsenic?

11:57.570 --> 11:59.471
So he was poisoned.
No, not given the amount.

11:59.505 --> 12:01.673
But the arsenic, along with
all the other particulates,

12:01.707 --> 12:02.874
make up soil that's found

12:02.908 --> 12:05.110
only in one place:

12:05.144 --> 12:07.512
the Hetao Plain
of inner Mongolia.

12:07.546 --> 12:08.980
He was killed
in Mongolia

12:09.015 --> 12:11.549
and then brought back
to the safe room?

12:11.584 --> 12:13.184
Seems a bit farfetched.

12:13.219 --> 12:14.386
Yeah.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.921
Well, maybe he came back
from Mongolia

12:16.956 --> 12:18.289
and hadn't showered yet.

12:18.324 --> 12:19.491
Seriously, Opie?

12:19.525 --> 12:20.846
I'm just trying
to help, Thurston.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.227
Okay, so how would Mongolian
soil end up

12:22.261 --> 12:23.461
in Todd Mirga's safe room?

12:23.496 --> 12:26.564
Aha. Now that...
that is a good question.

12:26.599 --> 12:28.600
I have no idea. But I
still have all these bags

12:28.634 --> 12:30.502
to go through, so...
What is that?

12:30.536 --> 12:32.003
Uh, this was in the urn
with his remains.

12:32.038 --> 12:33.538
Dr. Brennan wanted me
to bring it to you.

12:33.572 --> 12:35.473
Why me? This is bone.
Yes.

12:35.508 --> 12:37.409
But it's not human.

12:38.911 --> 12:40.278
Daniel Barr had
no prior arrests?

12:40.312 --> 12:41.780
Nope. Guy's
a Boy Scout.

12:41.814 --> 12:43.248
Had him pegged as a
possible blackmailer.

12:43.282 --> 12:45.083
With all the strings
he pulled for rich people,

12:45.117 --> 12:46.584
I would've expected
at least a misdemeanor.

12:46.619 --> 12:48.153
Whoa, what's this?

12:48.187 --> 12:50.088
That's a restraining order.
That's not good.

12:50.122 --> 12:52.524
It was taken out
by Todd Mirga's mother.

12:52.558 --> 12:54.426
So he was a threat, then.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.828
Not necessarily.
Take a look at her, huh?

12:56.862 --> 12:58.563
The mother's
a certified loon.

12:58.597 --> 13:00.598
Wow.
Yep.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.867
Look at that
rap sheet.

13:03.836 --> 13:05.336
Where's your bracelet?

13:05.371 --> 13:07.172
You're still wearing
the rope one that I made you.

13:07.206 --> 13:08.373
I love it.

13:08.407 --> 13:10.842
It was the first one
you gave me.

13:10.876 --> 13:12.877
And the other one...

13:12.912 --> 13:14.712
I'm afraid I'll
lose it at school.

13:14.747 --> 13:16.548
Maybe a ring
would've been better.

13:16.582 --> 13:18.249
No, I love it.

13:18.284 --> 13:20.552
So you had a good
time in Boston?

13:20.586 --> 13:21.820
Yeah, it was great.

13:21.854 --> 13:23.354
Yeah, so much history.

13:23.389 --> 13:25.590
There's no one there
like Dr. Brennan or your mom.

13:25.624 --> 13:27.725
And here I'm closer to you.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.461
Hey, you should transfer
to Georgetown.

13:29.495 --> 13:31.262
We could be even closer.

13:31.297 --> 13:34.466
I like my school.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.902
I can't believe how much I've
changed since I've been there.

13:37.937 --> 13:39.838
You look the same to me.

13:39.872 --> 13:41.573
Change is good.

13:41.607 --> 13:43.775
I know.
Tell me about it.

13:43.809 --> 13:46.978
I mean, it looks like
the hot sauce is going national.

13:47.012 --> 13:48.213
I know.

13:48.247 --> 13:50.648
You told me. It's great.

13:57.556 --> 13:58.923
So you think
I killed the weasel?

13:58.958 --> 14:00.258
Now, look, we just

14:00.292 --> 14:01.359
want to ask you some questions.

14:01.393 --> 14:02.760
No, no, no, no, no.

14:02.795 --> 14:04.229
You brought me here
because I'm Romani.

14:04.263 --> 14:06.264
I will file a civil lawsuit.
I know my rights.

14:06.298 --> 14:08.133
Well, judging from all

14:08.167 --> 14:10.335
the nuisance lawsuits
you've filed, I'm sure you do.

14:10.369 --> 14:13.171
This is the way it's always been
with you people and my people.

14:13.205 --> 14:16.040
Something goes wrong, and we are
the first one to blame.

14:16.075 --> 14:17.642
Look, this is a murder
investigation, okay?

14:17.676 --> 14:19.444
This is not
an ethnic persecution.

14:19.478 --> 14:21.646
You're just upset because
my Todd slept with your wife.

14:21.680 --> 14:22.714
What?

14:22.748 --> 14:24.749
He did not sleep with my wife.

14:24.783 --> 14:26.518
Then what are those horns
on your head, pretty boy?

14:26.552 --> 14:27.652
I'm lost.

14:27.686 --> 14:29.420
Yep, so am I. Okay, so, um,

14:29.455 --> 14:31.022
you have quite
the impressive

14:31.056 --> 14:32.290
criminal record here.

14:32.324 --> 14:35.693
Let's see,
fraud, larceny, theft...

14:35.728 --> 14:37.428
Let me ask you this.

14:37.463 --> 14:40.165
How does a mother steal
from her own son?

14:40.199 --> 14:41.799
Take something
when he's not looking?

14:41.834 --> 14:43.134
Yeah, your son accused you
of taking

14:43.169 --> 14:44.202
some of his collectibles
in the past.

14:44.236 --> 14:45.470
Mm-hmm.
Taking?

14:45.504 --> 14:48.306
He gave them to me
and forgot.

14:48.340 --> 14:49.874
He always been forgetful.

14:49.909 --> 14:51.709
A mother knows.

14:51.744 --> 14:53.978
Daniel had you escorted out
of the house numerous times.

14:54.013 --> 14:56.147
You weren't allowed there
unless it was to visit Todd.

14:56.182 --> 14:58.683
This a family matter.
No business of yours.

14:58.717 --> 15:00.218
You took out a restraining order
on Daniel

15:00.252 --> 15:01.319
thinking that way
you could stay in the house.

15:01.353 --> 15:02.353
He kept tossing you out anyway,

15:02.388 --> 15:03.688
so you killed him.

15:03.722 --> 15:07.158
If I killed him,
there would never be a body.

15:07.193 --> 15:09.594
The one you should be talking to
is the whore he's with now.

15:09.628 --> 15:11.296
Sarah Metzler?
Who else?

15:11.330 --> 15:13.965
She hated Daniel.
Why?

15:13.999 --> 15:16.100
Because when my son was done
with his whores,

15:16.135 --> 15:18.169
it was Daniel
who made them go away.

15:18.204 --> 15:20.171
Ask your wife.

15:23.576 --> 15:26.844
Advanced calcification.

15:26.879 --> 15:28.446
Other.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.847
Rib; thick,
rounded edge.

15:29.882 --> 15:31.249
Victim.

15:31.283 --> 15:33.184
All right, this is from
the victim.

15:33.219 --> 15:36.588
Could be part of the occipital,
but I'm not sure.

15:36.622 --> 15:39.023
You're correct.

15:39.058 --> 15:40.525
Here's a suture line.

15:40.559 --> 15:43.428
Also a fracture.

15:43.462 --> 15:44.729
That's probably
an expansion fracture

15:44.763 --> 15:46.264
caused by the heat
during cremation.

15:46.298 --> 15:48.066
I don't think so.

15:49.902 --> 15:52.170
This is not
an expansion fracture.

15:52.204 --> 15:54.239
It was caused by trauma.

15:54.273 --> 15:56.674
Trauma to the occipital
could be cause of death.

15:56.709 --> 15:57.942
We'll need more of the bone

15:57.977 --> 15:59.377
before we can say that
with certainty.

15:59.411 --> 16:01.579
Like finding a drop of water
in a creek.

16:02.615 --> 16:04.115
But I'll find it.

16:10.256 --> 16:12.890
There are
crystal particles

16:12.925 --> 16:14.492
on this fragment
of the occipital.

16:14.526 --> 16:16.227
Is the occipital
from Daniel Barr?

16:16.262 --> 16:17.295
Yes.

16:17.329 --> 16:19.163
The suture line confirms it.

16:19.198 --> 16:20.465
What are the particles?

16:20.499 --> 16:21.833
Hey.

16:21.867 --> 16:23.701
So the animal bone fragment
Finn gave me

16:23.736 --> 16:26.070
turned out to be
a piece of narwhal tusk.

16:26.105 --> 16:28.673
What is a piece of narwhal
tusk doing in the remains?

16:28.707 --> 16:30.174
That I cannot explain.

16:30.209 --> 16:32.977
And to add to the delicious
complexity of this find,

16:33.012 --> 16:35.513
I did radiometric dating on it.

16:35.547 --> 16:37.515
It's at least
a thousand years old.

16:37.549 --> 16:40.118
What, is it carved?
Yeah.

16:40.152 --> 16:41.686
Some striations showed up,

16:41.720 --> 16:44.055
as well as some silver and gold
particulates on one edge

16:44.089 --> 16:45.556
of the narwhal
fragment.

16:45.591 --> 16:47.592
A thousand-year-old tusk,
silver and gold?

16:47.626 --> 16:49.260
It must be some kind
of ancient artifact.

16:49.295 --> 16:51.629
He was struck
with a rare artifact--

16:51.664 --> 16:54.098
one that vanished from the room.

16:56.502 --> 16:58.569
You have a history
of dating rich men, don't you?

16:58.604 --> 17:00.638
I went to good
schools with wealthy people.

17:00.673 --> 17:02.240
And your parents,

17:02.274 --> 17:04.041
they went broke trying
to send you to those schools.

17:04.076 --> 17:05.576
You don't have any money,
either.

17:05.611 --> 17:08.746
Look, I know how people
see me, but I love Todd.

17:08.781 --> 17:11.749
And I would still love Todd
even if he was broke.

17:11.784 --> 17:12.983
And Daniel was my friend.

17:13.018 --> 17:14.018
Well, you know,
Todd's girlfriends,

17:14.053 --> 17:15.118
they didn't last too long.

17:15.154 --> 17:16.721
What, three, six months, tops?

17:16.755 --> 17:18.623
Then he would dump 'em
and go on to the next one.

17:18.656 --> 17:19.891
Todd takes me
everywhere with him.

17:19.925 --> 17:21.626
The Bolshoi anniversary
in Moscow,

17:21.660 --> 17:23.528
Johannesburg two months ago
to raise money for education.

17:23.561 --> 17:25.563
I ran that auction.

17:25.597 --> 17:27.332
He's never treated
any other women

17:27.366 --> 17:29.133
that he has he dated like that.

17:29.168 --> 17:31.069
Well, we do know that something
disappeared from Todd's home.

17:31.103 --> 17:32.670
And it's possible
that you took it

17:32.705 --> 17:34.572
so you could have yourself
a nice little nest egg

17:34.606 --> 17:35.807
when he tosses you out.

17:35.841 --> 17:37.942
Oh, my... No!

17:37.976 --> 17:40.511
No! I would never steal
from Todd.

17:40.546 --> 17:43.648
And I would never hurt anyone,
least of all my friend.

17:48.158 --> 17:50.626
I think I know
how the victim was killed.

17:50.660 --> 17:53.262
Really? The guy's
literally dust in the wind.

17:53.296 --> 17:55.197
That would be amazing,
even for you.

17:55.231 --> 17:57.266
Yes, sometimes
I surprise even myself.

17:57.300 --> 18:00.202
I need you to do a search
for Der Schlachter Kelch.

18:00.236 --> 18:01.770
Okay, I love
that you think

18:01.804 --> 18:03.438
I would know how to spell that.
It's German.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.973
It means
"the Slaughterer's Chalice."

18:05.008 --> 18:07.142
I think the victim was killed
with it.

18:09.579 --> 18:12.881
Okay, there's no photos,
but there is a painting.

18:12.916 --> 18:14.650
Well, that's because
it hasn't been seen

18:14.684 --> 18:15.984
in over 300 years.

18:16.019 --> 18:17.653
Oh, that's Giorgione.

18:17.687 --> 18:20.222
He's an artist
from the late 14th century.

18:20.256 --> 18:23.825
Can you enhance this
portion of the painting?

18:23.860 --> 18:25.194
He's depicted the gold,

18:25.228 --> 18:27.129
silver, jade, chalcedony

18:27.163 --> 18:28.864
that Hodgins found.

18:28.898 --> 18:30.599
The white material
is probably

18:30.633 --> 18:32.201
the narwhal tusk
from the legend.

18:32.235 --> 18:33.435
Wow.

18:33.469 --> 18:36.471
Marco Polo, huh?
This thing goes back.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.006
It actually predates him.

18:38.041 --> 18:41.143
The earliest mention of
the chalice is in 2018 B.C.

18:41.177 --> 18:42.411
in the Land of Punt.

18:42.445 --> 18:44.413
Over the next
2,000 years,

18:44.447 --> 18:47.516
the chalice traversed
a dozen empires.

18:47.550 --> 18:50.252
This thing must be worth
a fortune.

18:50.286 --> 18:51.386
It is.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.989
Expensive,
even for a billionaire.

18:54.023 --> 18:57.326
I... I can't believe
it still exists.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.229
So the last account
of the chalice was when

19:00.263 --> 19:03.465
a Qing general
was killed for it.

19:03.499 --> 19:05.968
Hence,
the Slaughterer's Chalice.

19:06.002 --> 19:07.169
Right.

19:07.203 --> 19:09.771
And to think
that 4,000 years later,

19:09.806 --> 19:13.175
bits of it would end up
in a concierge's head.

19:17.513 --> 19:19.314
When ancient treasures
are looted,

19:19.349 --> 19:21.683
it's worse than stealing art,
it's stealing history.

19:21.718 --> 19:24.038
Artifacts like the Slaughterer's
Chalice belong in a museum

19:24.053 --> 19:26.054
where everyone
can experience them.

19:26.089 --> 19:28.890
As opposed to some
rich creep's living room.

19:28.925 --> 19:30.726
Booth, you shouldn't
hate all rich people.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.828
They're a fact of life, like
the corpuscular theory of light.

19:32.862 --> 19:34.162
I don't hate rich people.

19:34.197 --> 19:35.764
I just... I don't like
entitled people.

19:35.798 --> 19:36.798
Big difference.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.634
This guy Todd,
he feels entitled

19:38.668 --> 19:41.336
to get tax breaks for him
and his friends.

19:41.371 --> 19:42.804
That's not illegal.
I don't care.

19:42.839 --> 19:44.273
It's still wrong, isn't it?

19:44.307 --> 19:46.041
What?

19:46.075 --> 19:48.443
You're a good man, Booth.
No, that's it.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.812
See, it's not that
I'm a good man or a special man.

19:50.847 --> 19:52.414
I'm just a normal person,
that's all.

19:53.449 --> 19:55.884
Oh, hold on.

19:55.918 --> 19:58.320
The Art Crime Division
came up with something.

19:58.354 --> 19:59.955
"The only dealer with
the connection necessary

19:59.989 --> 20:03.358
"to bring something like the
Chalice into the country is...

20:03.393 --> 20:05.460
Satima Najjar"?

20:09.032 --> 20:10.532
Wow. Look at this place.

20:10.566 --> 20:13.735
It's like stepping
into a museum.

20:13.770 --> 20:15.771
This is an exceptional
collection.

20:15.805 --> 20:18.140
Early Ottoman oil lamps,

20:18.174 --> 20:21.610
12th-century
Templar crosses,

20:21.644 --> 20:23.011
Etruscan vases.

20:23.046 --> 20:24.279
Fourth century.

20:24.314 --> 20:25.614
Booth!
Oh, sorry.

20:25.648 --> 20:28.417
Hello, I'm Satima Najjar.

20:28.451 --> 20:31.353
Always good to meet a collector
who knows her antiquities.

20:31.387 --> 20:32.954
I'm not a collector.

20:32.989 --> 20:34.289
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.

20:34.324 --> 20:35.991
This here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

20:36.025 --> 20:39.695
We need to ask you some
questions about Daniel Barr.

20:39.729 --> 20:41.963
Oh, has Daniel done
something illegal?

20:41.998 --> 20:44.499
No, he's dead,
which is perfectly legal.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.567
Except for the person
who killed him.

20:45.601 --> 20:47.536
True.
Oh, my.

20:47.570 --> 20:49.304
We have evidence
that Daniel was in possession

20:49.339 --> 20:51.640
of the Slaughterer's Chalice
at the time of his death.

20:51.674 --> 20:53.442
Impossible.

20:53.476 --> 20:54.710
Nobody has seen
the Slaughterer's Chalice

20:54.744 --> 20:56.044
in over 300 years,

20:56.079 --> 20:57.512
not since Bai Lang took it
back to Mongolia

20:57.547 --> 20:59.381
with the rest
of his spoils.

20:59.415 --> 21:00.582
So you're denying
that Daniel hired you

21:00.616 --> 21:02.150
to find this?
No, Daniel did

21:02.185 --> 21:03.652
e-mail me about the Chalice.

21:03.686 --> 21:05.754
He said he could pay me
as much as $50 million

21:05.788 --> 21:08.090
if I could do the impossible
and locate it for him.

21:08.124 --> 21:09.524
$50 million?

21:09.559 --> 21:10.792
That's a lot of money.

21:10.827 --> 21:13.762
With Daniel out of the way,
you would have

21:13.796 --> 21:15.297
a very wealthy new client.

21:15.331 --> 21:19.167
As my e-mail will attest,
I said no to the job.

21:19.202 --> 21:20.969
Even if I could find it,
the Slaughterer's Chalice

21:21.003 --> 21:22.637
would be an illegal sale.

21:22.672 --> 21:25.507
Turning him down in writing
would give you deniability.

21:25.541 --> 21:27.309
I am a reputable dealer.

21:27.343 --> 21:28.977
I don't traffic
in stolen artifacts.

21:29.011 --> 21:30.212
Actually,
that's not true.

21:30.246 --> 21:31.613
Why is that?

21:31.647 --> 21:33.248
This Mesopotamian basin

21:33.282 --> 21:36.218
is an early example
of narrative relief,

21:36.252 --> 21:39.588
dated approximately
3000 B.C.

21:39.622 --> 21:40.956
Discoloration shows evidence

21:40.990 --> 21:42.524
of iron oxide.

21:42.558 --> 21:44.259
Blood.
Blood.

21:44.293 --> 21:46.228
He was killed here.
The blood is over 2,000 years old.

21:46.262 --> 21:48.663
It's a sacrificial basin,

21:48.698 --> 21:51.700
one of only six in existence,
all housed at the Iraq Museum

21:51.734 --> 21:53.702
until they were stolen
during the war in 2003.

21:53.736 --> 21:56.271
I had no idea
that that was stolen.

21:56.305 --> 21:57.606
Well, you're under arrest.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.307
I told you,
I didn't kill Daniel.

21:59.342 --> 22:02.177
Right, but trafficking in
stolen artifacts, all right?

22:02.211 --> 22:04.880
While you're in custody, we
can talk all about Daniel.

22:04.914 --> 22:06.214
Isn't that right, Bones?

22:08.000 --> 22:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:26.469 --> 22:29.137
Okay, who...
Hello!

22:29.172 --> 22:30.405
Hello.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.307
Who paid for this?
Well, uh,

22:32.341 --> 22:34.443
the TV from Archie Bunker's
living room

22:34.477 --> 22:35.677
might be missing a tube,

22:35.711 --> 22:37.546
but, you know,
only temporarily,

22:37.580 --> 22:39.080
and I had the liquid nitrogen
stream device laying around...

22:39.115 --> 22:40.115
Let's back up a sec.

22:40.149 --> 22:41.550
You took something
from one of

22:41.584 --> 22:42.751
the Jeffersonian's
most popular exhibits?

22:42.785 --> 22:44.085
Yeah, well,

22:44.120 --> 22:45.721
everybody else had gone home,
so how else

22:45.755 --> 22:48.323
was I gonna build a crystal
cathode diffractometer?

22:48.357 --> 22:50.425
And why did you need to build
this crystal cathode di...

22:51.694 --> 22:53.395
Diffractometer.

22:53.429 --> 22:55.163
So, remember the crystalline
particles Dr. Brennan gave me?

22:55.198 --> 22:57.332
Well, I built this baby to
bombard them with electrons

22:57.366 --> 22:59.301
so I could identify them,
which I have.

22:59.335 --> 23:01.136
They are diamonds.

23:01.170 --> 23:03.738
You mean diamond powder?
Well, if you want to nitpick, yeah.

23:03.773 --> 23:06.942
So these diamonds
are probably from the Chalice.

23:06.976 --> 23:08.743
Well, that's what I
initially thought,

23:08.778 --> 23:10.445
but there was no mention
of diamonds anywhere

23:10.480 --> 23:12.047
in the legend
of the Slaughterer's Chalice.

23:12.081 --> 23:14.015
And the way these
diamonds are ground,

23:14.050 --> 23:15.684
the technology to do that,

23:15.718 --> 23:18.286
it wasn't even developed
until 1953.

23:18.321 --> 23:22.157
So where did this diamond dust
come from?

23:24.227 --> 23:26.995
So, you ever heard
of the Slaughterer's Chalice?

23:27.029 --> 23:29.297
- No. What is it?
- It's a priceless artifact

23:29.332 --> 23:31.533
that hasn't been seen
for over 300 years.

23:31.567 --> 23:33.068
That ring a
bell now, Todd?

23:33.102 --> 23:35.203
I already said no.
That question couldn't

23:35.238 --> 23:37.072
have been asked over the phone?
You're wasting my time.

23:37.106 --> 23:38.740
I'm not wasting
your time.

23:38.774 --> 23:40.675
I really don't care
if I'm wasting your time.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.411
Do you know who
Satima Najjar is, Mr. Mirga?

23:43.446 --> 23:45.614
I'd be a fool if I didn't;
I collect artifacts.

23:45.648 --> 23:47.816
Satima deals in them,
but I've never met her.

23:47.850 --> 23:50.085
Thought you're a man who's used
to getting what he wants, right?

23:50.119 --> 23:51.820
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

23:51.854 --> 23:53.388
Daniel Barr asked Satima

23:53.422 --> 23:55.857
to acquire the Slaughterer's
Chalice for you.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.526
He wouldn't have done that

23:57.560 --> 23:58.894
without an order from you.

23:58.928 --> 23:59.928
Daniel was always looking

23:59.929 --> 24:00.996
for new collectables for me.

24:01.030 --> 24:02.564
Sometimes he'd surprise me.

24:02.598 --> 24:04.666
He'd spend $50 million
without talking to you?

24:04.700 --> 24:07.235
Did you ever think
he was working for someone else?

24:07.270 --> 24:09.104
I wasn't his only client.

24:09.138 --> 24:10.672
Well, we have forensic
evidence that

24:10.706 --> 24:12.007
the Slaughterer's Chalice was

24:12.041 --> 24:14.175
in your safe room
when Daniel was killed.

24:14.210 --> 24:16.478
Killed while I was in rehab,
as I have said.

24:16.512 --> 24:18.152
Right. I'm sure
you could've fudged

24:18.180 --> 24:20.115
some records down there
in Costa Rica.

24:20.149 --> 24:23.351
Are you gonna arrest me,
Agent Booth?

24:27.490 --> 24:30.025
Thank you so much
for the update on the case.

24:31.561 --> 24:34.029
I'm sure the director
will be happy to hear

24:34.063 --> 24:36.531
how you're wasting
the taxpayer's money.

24:45.490 --> 24:47.524
The guy acts like he doesn't
have to play by the rules.

24:47.558 --> 24:48.859
Because he usually doesn't.

24:49.203 --> 24:50.437
Plutocrats and oligarchs

24:50.471 --> 24:51.671
are always afforded
special treatment.

24:51.706 --> 24:53.139
Well, not this time, okay?

24:53.174 --> 24:54.841
I'm not letting him
buy his way out of this.

24:54.875 --> 24:57.744
Booth, we have no proof
that Todd was in the country,

24:57.778 --> 24:59.512
let alone that he killed Daniel.

24:59.547 --> 25:01.247
You're gonna find something;
you always find something, okay?

25:01.282 --> 25:02.816
You don't want people
getting away with murder,

25:02.850 --> 25:04.384
and neither do I.

25:04.418 --> 25:06.920
I'm having the mortuary's
retort and cremulator

25:06.954 --> 25:08.588
shipped to the lab tomorrow.

25:08.622 --> 25:09.823
That could help.

25:09.857 --> 25:10.990
See, that? That's good.

25:11.025 --> 25:12.225
The, uh...

25:12.259 --> 25:13.893
That's great. Great stuff.

25:13.928 --> 25:16.463
You don't know what a retort
and cremulator are?

25:16.497 --> 25:18.131
You can't name one player
on the Flyers,

25:18.165 --> 25:19.466
can you?

25:19.500 --> 25:21.835
After Mr. Abernathy and I

25:21.869 --> 25:24.304
finished separating the remains
Yeah.

25:24.338 --> 25:26.673
that were mixed in
with Daniel Barr's,

25:26.707 --> 25:29.509
I realized that we're
missing parts of the victim.

25:29.543 --> 25:30.944
How? He's ash.

25:30.978 --> 25:32.679
Based on his size,
after cremation,

25:32.713 --> 25:35.782
his remains should
weigh three kilograms.

25:35.816 --> 25:38.385
We received only
2.31 kilograms.

25:38.419 --> 25:39.953
So you're missing
almost two pounds of the victim.

25:39.987 --> 25:41.348
Why can't you just say
"two pounds"

25:41.355 --> 25:43.289
instead of getting
all "metricy"?

25:43.324 --> 25:45.191
The mortician Todd's mother used
was shoddy.

25:45.226 --> 25:47.594
I think we'll find
the rest of Daniel

25:47.628 --> 25:49.362
in the cremation equipment.

25:49.397 --> 25:50.830
So you think it's the mother.

25:51.766 --> 25:52.932
I don't guess.

25:52.967 --> 25:54.401
Come on, a little guess.

25:54.435 --> 25:56.169
No.
Huh?

25:56.203 --> 25:57.704
No.
You think it's the mom.

25:57.738 --> 25:59.572
I'm not guessing.
I think you're wrong.

25:59.607 --> 26:01.040
I think it's Richie Rich.

26:05.212 --> 26:06.880
Oh, wow.

26:06.914 --> 26:10.150
Miracle anything was pulverized
in this cremulator.

26:10.184 --> 26:12.285
Grass on my lawn
has sharper blades.

26:12.319 --> 26:15.555
Well, and this retort
is a treasure trove

26:15.589 --> 26:17.791
of charred tissue
that should have been vaporized

26:17.825 --> 26:19.292
if the furnace
was running properly.

26:19.326 --> 26:21.461
It reminds me of
the oven I used to use

26:21.495 --> 26:22.662
at Arnie's Pizza
and Wings.

26:22.696 --> 26:23.930
Yeah, except here

26:23.964 --> 26:25.532
the cheesy looking bits
are flesh

26:25.566 --> 26:26.833
and the pepperoni
is charred muscle.

26:26.867 --> 26:29.869
And people ask me
how I stay so thin.

26:29.904 --> 26:31.838
Daniel Barr's cause of death

26:31.872 --> 26:34.174
was indeed blunt force trauma
from being hit with the Chalice.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.575
All right.

26:35.609 --> 26:36.910
Found the remaining segment
of the fracture

26:36.944 --> 26:38.611
in the victim's occipital.

26:38.646 --> 26:40.079
Yes, Mr. Abernathy.

26:40.114 --> 26:42.148
Three cheers for incompetence
and faulty equipment.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.350
I'm confident
you will find particulates

26:44.385 --> 26:46.252
from the Chalice
in the fracture.

26:46.287 --> 26:47.921
Oh, tissue.

26:47.955 --> 26:50.523
It's pretty charred,
but there should be enough

26:50.558 --> 26:51.758
to run some tests.

26:51.792 --> 26:53.092
It appears our victim was shot.

26:53.127 --> 26:54.394
I assure you, Mr. Abernathy,

26:54.428 --> 26:56.262
cause of death
was blunt force trauma.

26:56.297 --> 26:57.397
I'm not arguing that,

26:57.431 --> 26:59.599
but at some point,
he was a target.

26:59.633 --> 27:01.167
Look at the inferior margin

27:01.202 --> 27:02.635
on the scapula.

27:02.670 --> 27:04.070
Based on the remodeling,

27:04.104 --> 27:05.839
this injury was
about two weeks old

27:05.873 --> 27:07.040
when he was killed.

27:07.074 --> 27:08.241
Can I see that?

27:08.275 --> 27:10.009
So, first someone
shoots him,

27:10.044 --> 27:12.512
and then two weeks later,
he's bludgeoned to death?

27:12.546 --> 27:14.147
That is one persistent killer.

27:14.181 --> 27:15.648
Hey, look at this.
There seems to be

27:15.683 --> 27:17.517
some metal that melted
into the trabeculae.

27:17.551 --> 27:18.918
It's probably the bullet.

27:18.953 --> 27:20.119
I might be able to I.D. it.

27:20.154 --> 27:22.522
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

27:22.556 --> 27:24.157
Is this a bad time?

27:24.191 --> 27:25.191
No!
Yes.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.126
What? She asked; I answered.

27:27.161 --> 27:28.394
It's okay, Michelle.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.296
We can go to my office to talk.

27:30.331 --> 27:33.566
No, actually,
I'm not here for you.

27:33.601 --> 27:35.001
Oh.

27:36.270 --> 27:39.138
It's almost lunch. Go.

27:47.815 --> 27:50.750
I got to say, seeing
you makes me happier

27:50.784 --> 27:52.952
than a tornado
in a trailer park.

27:54.021 --> 27:55.955
Finn,

27:55.990 --> 27:58.958
is there someplace private
we could go?

27:58.993 --> 28:01.294
Ooh. I wish,

28:01.328 --> 28:03.463
but I'm already in hot water
for taking time away from work.

28:03.497 --> 28:05.999
No, that's not what I meant.

28:07.101 --> 28:08.334
This is a bad idea.

28:08.369 --> 28:09.969
I should've waited.

28:10.004 --> 28:11.704
We can talk later.
Wait.

28:11.739 --> 28:13.339
You're upset about something.

28:13.374 --> 28:15.475
It can wait.
No.

28:15.509 --> 28:17.010
If you're upset,
everything stops.

28:17.044 --> 28:18.478
I don't care what's going on.

28:27.187 --> 28:28.922
Finn...

28:30.958 --> 28:33.493
I don't know how to say this.

28:40.568 --> 28:43.736
Oh, man, you got
to be kidding me.

28:45.773 --> 28:47.507
I'm so sorry.

28:48.409 --> 28:50.410
What did I do?

28:50.444 --> 28:51.578
Nothing.

28:51.612 --> 28:55.548
I tried to tell you yesterday.

28:55.583 --> 28:58.918
School's changed me, I guess.

28:58.953 --> 29:02.755
I'm not the same person I was
even a year ago.

29:02.790 --> 29:04.290
Is there someone else?

29:04.325 --> 29:06.893
My mom tried to tell me
I was too young

29:06.927 --> 29:08.461
to make a commitment.

29:08.495 --> 29:10.964
I hate it that she was right.

29:10.998 --> 29:12.599
Who is he?

29:12.633 --> 29:14.567
It doesn't matter.

29:14.602 --> 29:16.703
It's not even that serious.

29:18.606 --> 29:21.741
But I can never lie to you.

29:21.775 --> 29:23.910
I'm sorry.

29:23.944 --> 29:26.613
You should never apologize
for being happy.

29:28.482 --> 29:30.783
You go be happy.

29:31.919 --> 29:34.320
Finn...
I'm serious.

29:36.156 --> 29:39.058
I understand.

30:04.551 --> 30:07.387
The tissue I retrieved
from the crematorium's furnace

30:07.421 --> 30:09.122
was enough to run a tox screen.

30:09.156 --> 30:11.991
Daniel Barr tested positive
for heroin.

30:12.026 --> 30:13.292
So he and Mirga
were drug buddies.

30:13.327 --> 30:14.694
Looks that way.
Well, look at this.

30:14.728 --> 30:16.429
So I found cupronickel

30:16.463 --> 30:19.766
bullet residue in Daniel's
remodeled gunshot wound.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.878
Cupronickel?

30:20.903 --> 30:22.468
Yeah, it's from an
antique bullet, right?

30:22.469 --> 30:24.404
Well, I traced it

30:24.438 --> 30:26.272
to a rare Colt
semi-automatic pistol,

30:26.306 --> 30:27.707
and it's one
from the prototype

30:27.741 --> 30:29.842
that the Army tested in 1905,

30:29.877 --> 30:32.345
which became
the famous 1911 pistol.

30:32.379 --> 30:34.313
Wild guess, but this looks like
a collectable.

30:34.348 --> 30:35.882
Yeah, there were only
two prototypes made,

30:35.916 --> 30:38.051
both very valuable.

30:38.085 --> 30:40.053
And...

30:40.087 --> 30:43.656
Todd Mirga purchased one
at auction six weeks ago.

30:43.691 --> 30:45.658
When Daniel was shot.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.166
I see I've graduated

30:53.200 --> 30:54.834
to your interrogation room;
this must be serious.

30:54.868 --> 30:56.369
We know that Daniel Barr

30:56.403 --> 30:57.470
was your junkie buddy.

30:57.504 --> 30:58.971
And we know
that you own the gun

30:59.006 --> 31:00.640
that shot him two weeks
before he was killed.

31:00.674 --> 31:02.542
And that gun mysteriously
disappeared.

31:02.576 --> 31:03.776
It was an accident.

31:03.811 --> 31:04.811
We were fooling around.

31:04.845 --> 31:06.746
When you were high?
Yes.

31:06.780 --> 31:08.414
Daniel was just grazed.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.582
He understood.

31:09.616 --> 31:11.284
Because you paid him off.

31:11.318 --> 31:14.387
Medical expenses
and a bonus, yes.

31:14.421 --> 31:15.555
It seemed fair.

31:15.589 --> 31:17.724
But I realized
I had a problem,

31:17.758 --> 31:21.661
and I went to rehab
two days later.

31:21.695 --> 31:23.536
You know, I think
that your little junkie buddy

31:23.564 --> 31:25.598
threatened to expose
your drug use and the shooting

31:25.632 --> 31:28.634
unless you kept paying him,
so you killed him.

31:28.669 --> 31:29.969
I was in rehab.

31:30.003 --> 31:31.471
Right, under
an assumed name.

31:31.505 --> 31:34.373
You see, we checked on all that.

31:34.408 --> 31:37.210
All those records were destroyed
when you left.

31:37.244 --> 31:38.411
Guess what?

31:38.445 --> 31:39.812
You have no alibi.

31:39.847 --> 31:41.848
We know Daniel
was killed with

31:41.882 --> 31:43.316
the Slaughterer's Chalice.

31:43.350 --> 31:45.485
We have forensic evidence
of the gold, silver,

31:45.519 --> 31:47.954
narwhal tusk,
even diamond powder

31:47.988 --> 31:50.423
that must have been
placed on it more recently.

31:52.593 --> 31:54.327
Diamond powder?

31:54.361 --> 31:56.095
Yes.

32:06.140 --> 32:09.542
So... you found everything.

32:11.278 --> 32:12.945
Yes.

32:20.354 --> 32:23.222
Daniel was ripping me off.

32:23.257 --> 32:25.091
I caught him trying
to take the Chalice.

32:25.125 --> 32:28.060
We fought...

32:28.095 --> 32:29.729
I hit him with it.

32:29.763 --> 32:31.564
Is that a confession?

32:31.598 --> 32:33.399
Yes.

32:33.433 --> 32:36.903
But I would like a lawyer,
if you don't mind.

32:41.886 --> 32:44.060
Wow, okay, that doesn't
make any sense.

32:44.061 --> 32:46.329
Guys like Mirga, all right,
they're just too cocky

32:46.364 --> 32:47.831
to give themselves
up like that.

32:47.865 --> 32:49.666
Maybe the preponderance
of evidence

32:49.700 --> 32:51.201
shamed him
into confessing.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.103
They don't have any
shame either, okay?

32:53.137 --> 32:55.004
Look, maybe he knows, you know,

32:55.039 --> 32:56.573
with his rehab stay
and his drug use,

32:56.607 --> 32:58.408
that he can sow
reasonable doubt.

32:58.442 --> 33:01.177
We need some tangible evidence
to tie him to the crime scene.

33:01.212 --> 33:02.492
Something that proves
that he was

33:02.513 --> 33:04.114
in the safe room
and not Costa Rica.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.228
It's possible he's
protecting his mother.

33:05.229 --> 33:06.921
You thought that she
was capable of murder.

33:06.946 --> 33:07.851
Very true. That's fine.

33:07.852 --> 33:09.619
Let's see if you can get me
anything on her.

33:09.653 --> 33:12.021
Anything at all, all right?
Just something.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.957
I'm gonna go double check with
the Costa Rican authorities

33:13.991 --> 33:15.058
and the rehab center, all right?

33:15.092 --> 33:16.760
Okay.
Bye.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.374
Mr. Abernathy?

33:31.409 --> 33:33.443
Um, Dr. Brennan.

33:34.578 --> 33:35.912
I'm sorry, I was
just thinking.

33:35.946 --> 33:37.680
About the case,
of course.

33:37.715 --> 33:41.284
If you're too upset to work,
I can continue without you.

33:41.318 --> 33:43.319
No, I'm good, ma'am.
It's best to have a task

33:43.354 --> 33:45.188
to keep my mind from drifting.
I agree.

33:45.222 --> 33:47.524
Have you found
anything new

33:47.558 --> 33:50.226
which could prove probative?
Uh, no.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.228
Thurston and I have
searched and re-swabbed

33:52.263 --> 33:53.897
every last millimeter
of the bone fragments.

33:53.931 --> 33:55.565
So you've repeated
all prior tests.

33:55.599 --> 33:57.767
Yes, ma'am, to double
check our findings.

34:01.038 --> 34:03.039
Question, Mr. Abernathy.

34:03.073 --> 34:06.976
Since the body was cremated,
even incompetently,

34:07.011 --> 34:10.280
what would happen to
any transferred particulates

34:10.313 --> 34:12.782
with a melting point
of less than 1,000 degrees?

34:12.817 --> 34:14.650
They'd melt.
Yes.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.920
And like water,
they'd pool

34:16.954 --> 34:19.222
within the fractures

34:19.255 --> 34:21.458
and pores of
the bone matrix.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.360
I'm a tree stump.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.094
We should look
inside the bone.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.764
Please bisect this segment
of the occipital

34:28.799 --> 34:31.501
and have Dr. Hodgins swab
inside the trabeculae.

34:31.534 --> 34:32.936
Yes, ma'am,
right away.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.242
Have you wept yet,
Mr. Abernathy?

34:39.275 --> 34:40.677
I beg your pardon?

34:40.710 --> 34:41.945
Wept.

34:41.978 --> 34:43.246
Cried.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.648
For your loss.

34:46.817 --> 34:48.618
There is a very
well-established

34:48.652 --> 34:50.920
neuronal connection
between the lacrimal gland

34:50.955 --> 34:54.357
and the brain's limbic system
associated with emotion.

34:54.391 --> 34:57.427
Stifling the body's need to cry

34:57.461 --> 35:01.998
in emotionally difficult
situations is unhealthy.

35:04.001 --> 35:05.168
Thank you, ma'am.

35:05.202 --> 35:08.338
I-I'll remember that.

35:26.023 --> 35:28.491
So it looks like there
were minute traces

35:28.526 --> 35:31.661
of micro-diamonds
inside the bone matrix.

35:31.695 --> 35:33.696
Like the ones found
in the vacuumed debris?

35:33.731 --> 35:35.532
Yes, yeah.

35:35.566 --> 35:38.735
But here, uh, there's a resin
secreted by the female lac bug.

35:38.769 --> 35:41.104
Great. So diamonds
and bug poop.

35:41.138 --> 35:42.539
No.
No, not... exactly.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.440
Not in its natural state.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.276
See, here it's been processed,
along with benzoyl peroxide,

35:46.310 --> 35:49.012
into a lacquer
much like that,

35:49.046 --> 35:50.647
uh, found in
nail polish.

35:50.681 --> 35:53.283
And it seems like
the micro-diamonds

35:53.317 --> 35:56.219
were also infused
into that lacquer.

35:56.253 --> 35:58.688
So, what, diamond nail polish?

35:58.722 --> 36:00.356
Oh, yeah, I...

36:00.391 --> 36:03.660
just read about this. Uh...

36:05.496 --> 36:07.196
"Million Dollar Manicure."

36:07.231 --> 36:08.352
You've got to be kidding me.

36:08.365 --> 36:09.499
Each bottle contains

36:09.533 --> 36:12.201
over 100 carats
of micro-diamonds.

36:12.236 --> 36:13.703
It was
auctioned off at

36:13.737 --> 36:15.138
a celebrity charity event

36:15.172 --> 36:16.573
in Johannesburg two months ago.

36:16.607 --> 36:18.274
Who has a million bucks

36:18.309 --> 36:20.677
- to blow on nail polish?
- Don't look at me.

36:20.711 --> 36:22.512
I don't have that kind
of money anymore.

36:22.546 --> 36:24.013
Well, according
to the article,

36:24.048 --> 36:25.848
there were three
winning bids.

36:25.883 --> 36:27.550
The wife of a Saudi Prince,

36:27.585 --> 36:30.420
Beyoncé, of course, and...

36:30.454 --> 36:31.888
Sarah Metzler.

36:31.922 --> 36:34.057
Mirga's girlfriend.

36:35.859 --> 36:37.927
<i>I love Todd.</i>
<i>I don't care about the money.</i>

36:37.962 --> 36:39.128
And he loved you.

36:39.163 --> 36:41.397
And he confessed
to save you.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.802
I just knew that
if he could get himself clean,

36:45.836 --> 36:47.303
he'd be so much happier.

36:47.338 --> 36:48.738
He thought it, too.

36:48.772 --> 36:50.740
But Daniel didn't care.

36:50.774 --> 36:53.142
He wanted a friend
to shoot up with.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.545
He was bringing heroin over
for Todd that day,

36:55.579 --> 36:57.313
for-for when he got home.

36:57.348 --> 36:58.948
Not the Slaughterer's Chalice?

36:58.983 --> 37:00.950
No, I set that up
with Satima

37:00.985 --> 37:03.486
because I knew how much
he loved that piece.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.887
You brought it to the house

37:04.922 --> 37:06.556
when you saw Daniel
putting the drugs

37:06.590 --> 37:08.558
in the safe room.

37:08.592 --> 37:11.127
We fought about the drugs.

37:12.997 --> 37:15.665
And then I hit him with it.

37:15.699 --> 37:19.235
With the... with the
Slaughterer's Chalice.

37:19.269 --> 37:22.171
Sarah, I need to know
where the Chalice is.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.340
It's in a locker in my gym.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.342
I didn't know
where else to put it.

37:26.377 --> 37:29.679
All I wanted to do
was surprise him

37:29.713 --> 37:31.981
for when he came home.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.119
I just wanted to keep him safe.

37:36.153 --> 37:39.589
You protect the person
that you love.

37:39.623 --> 37:42.125
Don't you?

37:54.505 --> 37:55.972
Dr. Brennan said
you asked for

37:56.006 --> 37:59.042
the Ghost Killer files
to keep your mind occupied.

37:59.076 --> 38:00.176
Uh, yeah.

38:00.210 --> 38:01.678
But it's not going so good.

38:01.712 --> 38:04.781
As awesome as these
Ghost Killer cases are,

38:04.815 --> 38:08.651
I've been reading this one
for the past half hour.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.119
Finn...

38:10.154 --> 38:11.754
You don't have to say anything,
Dr. Saroyan.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.357
No, no, I-I want to.

38:14.391 --> 38:16.826
I want to tell you
how much you mean to me.

38:16.860 --> 38:19.529
And how much
you helped Michelle grow.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.731
I know it's probably not
what you want to hear right now,

38:21.765 --> 38:24.000
but it's the truth.

38:24.034 --> 38:26.335
She is a better person
because of knowing you.

38:28.272 --> 38:30.373
And so am I.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.244
You know what
the funny thing is?

38:35.279 --> 38:36.913
I don't blame her.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.815
I don't understand.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.017
I had money for
the first time in my life,

38:41.051 --> 38:42.518
a wonderful girl,

38:42.553 --> 38:44.887
who just happened to have
a great mama to boot.

38:44.922 --> 38:47.023
I had everything.

38:47.057 --> 38:50.693
But the truth is,
nobody gets everything.

38:50.728 --> 38:52.628
We get what we love most.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.164
Sometimes it's just hard
to know what that is.

38:57.401 --> 38:59.736
That's a struggle we all have.

38:59.770 --> 39:02.705
Thank you for coming
to check on me, ma'am.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.507
Think I'd like to go
home for the night,

39:04.541 --> 39:06.743
if that's okay.
Sure.

39:10.214 --> 39:13.349
♪ Oh, yeah, you and me

39:13.383 --> 39:16.986
♪ We are one and the same

39:17.020 --> 39:19.789
♪ We light up the fire

39:19.823 --> 39:23.392
♪ And we run from the flame

39:23.427 --> 39:26.496
♪ We pray for a storm

39:26.530 --> 39:32.401
♪ Then hide from the rain

39:32.436 --> 39:35.738
♪ You and me

39:35.773 --> 39:38.975
♪ We are one and the same.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.044
I can't believe it.

39:42.079 --> 39:44.914
I can't believe
we actually have it.

39:44.948 --> 39:47.250
Taking it out of the
crate, it had this

39:47.284 --> 39:49.786
wonderful musty bouquet
of antiquity.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.087
Probably because
we found it

39:51.121 --> 39:52.522
in Sarah's gym locker

39:52.556 --> 39:54.056
under a pair of
sweaty gym socks.

39:54.091 --> 39:55.458
It's incredible,
isn't it?

39:55.492 --> 39:57.794
It's over
4,000 years old.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.830
The Chalice has traveled
across continents,

40:00.864 --> 40:02.598
been touched by
kings and emperors.

40:02.633 --> 40:04.133
It's a nice cup.

40:04.168 --> 40:05.368
"Nice cup"?

40:05.402 --> 40:07.370
Yeah. It's not
the Stanley Cup,

40:07.404 --> 40:09.005
but it's a nice cup.
It's a nice thing.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.940
Booth, I don't think
you appreciate

40:10.974 --> 40:13.342
what an extraordinary find this is.
Look, I get it.

40:13.377 --> 40:15.378
It just doesn't do it for me.
Well, what do you mean?

40:15.412 --> 40:16.579
What doesn't it do?
It just doesn't do it for me.

40:16.613 --> 40:18.047
I mean, it's
nice and all,

40:18.081 --> 40:19.482
but it's-it's
kind of creepy,

40:19.516 --> 40:21.384
if you think about it.
Look at the workmanship.

40:21.418 --> 40:22.919
Do you know how many people have
been killed over that thing?

40:22.953 --> 40:24.754
That just adds to its history
and fascination.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.924
I'm gonna still go with the
Stanley Cup, okay? Can we leave?

40:27.958 --> 40:30.593
We've been staring at this thing
for about 45 minutes now.

40:30.627 --> 40:32.195
I guess so.
Okay, let's go.

40:32.229 --> 40:34.430
Let's go get something
filled in our own cups.

40:34.464 --> 40:35.932
The Kirkland
Archeological Society

40:35.966 --> 40:38.134
wants me to write a paper
about its discovery.

40:38.168 --> 40:40.069
You'll be prominently featured.
Me?

40:40.103 --> 40:41.637
Really?
Of course.

40:41.672 --> 40:44.307
Without your help,
the Chalice might still be lost.

40:44.341 --> 40:46.221
Will they have a picture of me
with the article?

40:46.243 --> 40:47.977
I don't know about that.
There should be

40:48.011 --> 40:49.145
a picture of me holding it.
That's what...

40:49.179 --> 40:50.146
No, Booth!

40:50.180 --> 40:51.280
You can't touch it.

40:51.315 --> 40:52.381
It's thousands of years old.

40:52.416 --> 40:53.416
Well, when you win
the Stanley Cup,

40:53.450 --> 40:54.984
you hold the Cup over your head

40:55.018 --> 40:56.986
because you're proud
of winning the Cup!

40:57.020 --> 40:58.137
I mean, aren't you
proud of this thing?

40:58.162 --> 40:58.921
Yes,

40:58.922 --> 41:00.690
but this picture
wouldn't be going

41:00.724 --> 41:01.958
in a sports publication.

41:01.992 --> 41:03.993
It would be in
a scholarly journal.

41:04.027 --> 41:05.461
Okay, yeah,
but you have to admit,

41:05.495 --> 41:07.230
having a picture,
that would increase sales,

41:07.264 --> 41:08.865
that'd boost 'em up.
It'd be good, right?

41:08.866 --> 41:10.533
Of course, but...
There you go.

41:10.567 --> 41:12.468
Quick, picture!
Won the Cup!

41:12.502 --> 41:13.957
Oh, my God!

41:13.982 --> 41:15.982
Cup. Yes. Okay,
don't worry about it. FBI.

41:16.103 --> 41:17.242
I got it all taken care of.
break something off.

41:17.267 --> 41:19.099
We won the Cup.
You're gonna break something.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.883
How about I take a selfie?
Come on.

41:20.884 --> 41:21.551
No, Booth. Put it back.
