02:15.503 --> 02:19.240

YOU'D BE MUCH PRETTIER.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.231
TRY SEEING THE BOY

05:31.231 --> 05:33.401
KISS ANOTHER GIRL
IN AN ELEVATOR,

05:33.401 --> 05:35.736
THEN WAIT AROUND WHILE HE TAKES
ALL DAY

05:35.736 --> 05:38.138
TO DECIDE WHETHER HE
WANTS YOU BACK OR NOT.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.440
[elevator bell dings]

05:42.142 --> 05:43.811
[slamming sounds]

05:43.811 --> 05:44.978

THROW 'EM UP,

05:58.325 --> 06:00.728
AND AFTER THAT,
BABYLACE COMES ONSTAGE

06:00.728 --> 06:02.430
TO ACCEPT HIS AWARD.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.765

FOUR LEOPARD OUTFITS,

06:06.834 --> 06:08.436

06:16.777 --> 06:19.680
THAT BABYLACE DEMANDS

06:19.680 --> 06:23.617
- NO BEANS MEANS BABYLACE
WILL FIRE HIS NEW PRODUCER.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.653
WHICH IS ME!

06:25.653 --> 06:26.920

MAY HAVE TAKEN SOME JELLY BEANS

06:49.777 --> 06:52.713
FROM THE DRESSING ROOM
NEXT DOOR.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.783
- PUPPY DOG,

06:58.786 --> 07:01.722

07:12.199 --> 07:14.868
YOU KNOW, GETTING OUR PUZZLE ON.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.069
- HEY, YOU WANT IN?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.939
THIS IS GONNA TAKE US
UNTIL, LIKE, 4:30.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.307
- NO, THANKS.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.642

07:21.642 --> 07:23.511
WE'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.746
NOT LEAVING THE PALMWOODS.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.114
NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.181
LEAVE.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.282
- WAIT.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.852
ARE YOU GUYS BABYSITTING ME?

07:31.852 --> 07:34.522
- NAW.
- WHAT? WHAT ARE THOSE WORDS?

07:34.522 --> 07:36.123
- NO, I MEAN, WHAT'S MORE FUN

07:36.123 --> 07:39.259
THAN HANGING OUT
AND PUZZLING?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.594
- EVERYTHING.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.896
SO I'M HEADED DOWN THE STREET
TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE

07:42.896 --> 07:44.264
TO CHECK OUT
THE NEW ARCADE GAME.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.667
both: OH.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.968
YEAH.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.037
WE CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.440
- NOW, THIS IS JUST A PRECAUTION

07:53.440 --> 07:55.943
TO MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T FRACTURE
ANYTHING WHEN YOU FELL.

07:55.943 --> 07:59.547
- OH, BUT NURSE,
YOU'VE ATTACHED ME TO THE CHAIR.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.014
- EXACTLY.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.551
- NOW, JO'S NOT RESPONDING
WITH TEXT KISSES.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.853
I USED TO GET AN XO
AFTER EVERY TEXT.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.555
NOW THERE'S NO Xs.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.156
JUST Os.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.791
- KEVIN,

08:10.791 --> 08:12.693
I COULDN'T BE THERE
FOR YOU GROWING UP,

08:12.693 --> 08:15.696
BUT I'M HERE FOR YOU NOW.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.631
- YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
HIS DAD, RIGHT?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.567
- MADAM, PLEASE.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.570
NOW, WHEN A GIRL SEES YOU
KISSING ANOTHER BIRD,

08:22.570 --> 08:24.672
ALL SHE CAN THINK ABOUT IS
YOU KISSING THE OTHER BIRD,

08:24.672 --> 08:26.139
SO WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO

08:26.139 --> 08:30.243
IS GET JO TO STOP THINKING ABOUT
YOU KISSING THE OTHER BIRD.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.378
- HOW?

08:31.378 --> 08:32.913
- HEART ATTACK.

08:32.913 --> 08:33.914
- HUH?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.048
- I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.049

08:36.049 --> 08:37.084

08:39.219 --> 08:40.854
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO WORK THESE THINGS.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.691

08:47.494 --> 08:48.662
[electrical zapping]

08:48.662 --> 08:50.097
- [groaning] NOW,
WHAT WE'VE GO TO DO

08:50.097 --> 08:52.132
IS BLAST AWAY THAT BAD MEMORY
OF YOU

08:52.132 --> 08:54.134
AND REPLACE IT WITH
A GREAT NEW MEMORY.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.103
SO WHAT WAS HER FAVORITE THING

08:56.103 --> 08:59.139
FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO DO TOGETHER?

08:59.139 --> 09:02.610
- UH, WE USED TO LOVE
GOING ON PICNICS TOGETHER.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.678
- OH, THEN YOU ARE GOING
TO MAKE HER

09:04.678 --> 09:06.980
THE MOTHER OF ALL PICNICS.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.448
* PICNIC TIME

09:08.448 --> 09:09.683
* IS ON MY MIND

09:09.683 --> 09:11.451

09:20.027 --> 09:22.095
- OH! THAT'S THE STUFF.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.466
- BABYLACE-SITTING
IS AWESOME.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.637
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,

09:29.637 --> 09:30.971
I WILL BE PLAYING
THAT ARCADE GAME

09:30.971 --> 09:33.340

09:36.844 --> 09:38.478
YOU WON'T BE PLAYING
THAT NEW ARCADE GAME

09:38.478 --> 09:39.780

10:42.943 --> 10:44.878
FORGET ALL ABOUT
THE KISSING LUCY THING.

10:44.878 --> 10:48.281
- PLUS, WHO DOESN'T LIKE SHRIMP?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.384
PITY I'M ALLERGIC.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.638
THERE'S BEEN A SMALL
COMPLICATION WITH THE PICNIC.

- OH.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.074
DID YOU NOT WANT TO HAVE IT?

11:14.074 --> 11:16.009

- WHY ISN'T HE UP AND SINGING?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.627
- THEY'RE OUT OF POWER.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.996
- THEY'RE WHAT?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.898
- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I USED
THEM TOO MUCH, OKAY?

11:37.898 --> 11:38.899
CLEAR.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.468
CLEAR.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.203
WE'RE TERRIBLE BABYSITTERS.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.578
- WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.013
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.615
YOU'RE THE FUTURE DOCTOR WITH
ALL THE KNOWLEDGE AND STUFF.

11:55.615 --> 11:59.552
- OKAY, UH, FIRST, UM,
WE DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.587
HE LOOKS DEAD.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.922
- OKAY.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.257
- SECONDLY, UH, THE SEARCH
FOR THE CAUSE OF INJURY.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.492
- SHRIMP?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.460
- AND SO I SHOULD, UH,
ADMINISTER...

12:07.460 --> 12:09.362
AN ALLERGY INJECTION.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.968
WHOO!
THAT WAS CLOSE.

12:14.968 --> 12:15.969
- SO DO IT!

12:15.969 --> 12:17.570
- OH, RIGHT.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.072
- OH!

12:19.072 --> 12:20.107
OH.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.174
THANK YOU, NURSE.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.444
YOU'RE AS STRONG
AS YOU ARE FEMALE.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.813
- YOU KNOW I'M A GUY, RIGHT?

12:25.813 --> 12:27.280
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.315
SON.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.516
SON.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.219
YOUR PICNIC.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.822
LOOKS LIKE IT WENT AMAZING.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.889
- ACTUALLY DIDN'T GO AT ALL.

12:35.889 --> 12:36.957
- OH.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.225
- 'CAUSE YOU SORT OF DIED
ON IT.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.828
AND THEN IN A PANIC,
I CALLED JO LUCY.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.596
- OH, THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME TO FIX THINGS.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.167
FIRST, WE'LL NEED MORE
OF THESE GREEN LEG STICKS.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.401
- WHY?

12:48.401 --> 12:51.138
- BECAUSE I'VE REALIZED
THAT I LOVE SHRIMP.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.672
- DON'T EAT THAT.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.976
- HERE COMES THE SWELLING.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.513
- LOOK, PUPPY DOG,
YOU'RE VERY TALENTED.

13:00.513 --> 13:04.852
BUT BABYLACE IS VERY FOND OF
IMPORTED KIWI GREEN JELLY BEANS.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.553
AND IF THOSE ARE NOT
IN HIS DRESSING ROOM,

13:06.553 --> 13:07.921
THEN HE WILL FIRE ME.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.123
NOW, GIVE ME THOSE JELLY BEANS!

13:11.691 --> 13:13.160
- HERE YOU GO.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.763
- YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.198
- FORGET BABYLACE.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.567
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
ABOUT TONIGHT

13:20.567 --> 13:21.568
IS ME.

* THROW 'EM UP *

13:35.582 --> 13:37.918
- OKAY, THAT KID
IS A TOTAL BRAT.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.287
- WHO FELL RIGHT INTO MY TRAP,

13:40.287 --> 13:43.891
BECAUSE I CAUGHT EVERY RUDELY
THROWN JELLY BEAN.

13:43.891 --> 13:47.227
AND COMBINED WITH THE ONES
THAT WE FOUND ON THE FLOOR...

13:47.227 --> 13:53.233
BABYLACE HAS HIS BOWL OF
IMPORTED KIWI GREEN JELLY BEANS.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.935
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.303
- I KNOW THAT!

13:59.907 --> 14:02.009
- I DON'T NEED A BABYSITTER.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.012
I HAVE EVERY EMERGENCY CONTACT
ON MY SPEED DIAL,

14:05.012 --> 14:06.313
AND IF I'M HUNGRY,

14:06.313 --> 14:09.316
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF MAKING A SANDWICH.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.321
- KATIE, WE ARE MEN
WITH ORDERS FORM YOUR MOM

14:14.321 --> 14:16.123
TO KEEP YOU FROM LEAVING
THE PALMWOODS.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.657
- AND IF WE FOLLOW THOSE ORDERS,

14:17.657 --> 14:19.026
WE GET TOYS.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.961
both: TOYS.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.195
- I'M LEAVE THE PALMWOODS

14:22.195 --> 14:24.131

THAT ARCADE GAME TODAY.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.833

- HOW DOES SHE DO THAT?

14:37.444 --> 14:38.545
- OH!
- COME ON!

14:38.545 --> 14:39.947
GO, GO, GO, GO!

14:41.114 --> 14:42.182
- HEY, GUYS.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.652
COOL. BABYLACE.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.324
- WHERE HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN?

14:51.324 --> 14:53.994
GUSTAVO SAID WE HAVE
TO BABYSIT BABYLACE TOGETHER.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.429
- MAMA KNIGHT TOLD JAMES AND ME
TO WATCH KATIE.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.798
- YOU WANT TO SWITCH?
TELL US NOW.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.167
both: NO, WE'RE GOOD.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.969
- YEAH.
- KATIE!

15:03.971 --> 15:05.038
- RIGHT.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.473
I FIGURED EVERYTHING OUT.

15:06.473 --> 15:10.677
WE'RE GOING TO WRITE JO
A LOVE SONG.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.379
- A LOVE SONG COULD WORK.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.380
- WHEN SHE HEARS IT,

15:13.380 --> 15:14.982
ALL SHE'LL THINK ABOUT IS YOU

15:14.982 --> 15:17.650
AND NOT ALL THE STUPID THINGS
YOU'VE SAID AND DONE ALL DAY.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.019
- WE CAN'T WRITE A LOVE SONG

15:19.019 --> 15:21.254
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET YOU
TO THE HALL OF ROCK AWARDS

15:21.254 --> 15:22.755
IN ONE HOUR.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.325
- I MET, MARRIED,
AND DIVORCED MY THIRD WIFE

15:25.325 --> 15:26.726
IN LESS TIME THAN THAT.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.996
NOW KISS ME.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.397
- WHAT?

15:30.397 --> 15:32.532
- THE SONGS GOT TO HAVE
THE WORDS "KISS ME" IN IT.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.601
AND IT STARTS LIKE THIS.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.902
* I LOVE YOU SO MUCH

15:35.902 --> 15:38.305
* I WANT TO FEEL YOUR TOW-OUCH

HE'S IN THE SHALLOW END.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.505
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HALLOWEEN?

16:12.505 --> 16:15.608
DO YOU KIDS LIKE JELLY BEANS?

16:15.608 --> 16:18.178
OH, OKAY.
HERE YOU GO.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.049
OOPS.
ALL GONE.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.886
- YOU ATE 1,000 JELLY BEANS?

16:26.886 --> 16:28.821
- THOSE ARE FOR BABYLACE!

16:28.821 --> 16:31.658
- NOBODY CARES
ABOUT THAT DINOSAUR.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.094
THE ONLY THING PEOPLE
ARE GONNA REMEMBER ABOUT TONIGHT

16:34.094 --> 16:36.629
IS ME.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.242
- THAT'S IT.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.478
I'M DEAD.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.714
- YOU'RE REALLY GONNA KEEP ME
IN THE KATIE CAGE UNTIL 4:30?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.583
- AFTER YOUR ATTEMPTS
TO ESCAPE US

16:56.583 --> 16:58.151
THROUGH THE WINDOW,
THE FIREPLACE,

16:58.151 --> 17:00.753
AND AIR DUCTS--
WHICH WAS IMPRESSIVE...

17:00.753 --> 17:02.989
- YOU HAVE LEFT US NO CHOICE.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.424
- OKAY.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.725
BUT CAN I AT LEAST
WASH MY HANDS?

17:05.725 --> 17:08.495
THE AIR DUCTS WERE FILTHY.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.230
- SIR, IT CHECKS OUT.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.399
- WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE TOO BIG
TO FIT THROUGH THE DRAIN,

17:12.399 --> 17:14.767
SO WE'LL ALLOW IT.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.103
[both make machine sounds]

17:20.273 --> 17:21.774
- WE'RE REALLY GREAT
BABYSITTERS.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.376
- THE BEST.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.814
- HEY, HOW LONG HAS SHE
BEEN WASHING HER HANDS?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.449
- UH, 22 MINUTES.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.617
- HM.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.818
[record scratches]

17:31.818 --> 17:33.253
- OH, KATIE!

17:43.130 --> 17:44.731
HOW DID SHE DO THAT?

17:48.435 --> 17:50.036
- HEY, GUYS.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.607
- BUT YOU--

17:54.607 --> 17:55.608
THE WALL--

17:55.608 --> 17:56.743
- ESCAPED?

17:56.743 --> 17:57.844
- NOW BACK?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.346
- HERE?

17:59.346 --> 18:01.948
- WELL, I WAS IN THE LOBBY
WITH A CLEAR SHOT AT FREEDOM

18:01.948 --> 18:03.983
WHEN IT HIT ME.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.985
IT'S WAY MORE FUN HANGING OUT
WITH YOU GUYS

18:05.985 --> 18:09.722
THAN PLAYING SOME STUPID ARCADE
GAME AT A CONVENIENCE STORE.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.625
- SO YOU'LL STAY HERE
WITH US

18:12.625 --> 18:14.727
UNTIL YOUR MOM COMES BACK?

18:14.727 --> 18:16.629
- WHY NOT?
NOW, LET'S GO.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.999
THIS PUZZLE ISN'T
GONNA FINISH ITSELF.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.737
- SO HOW DID YOU REMOVE THE--

18:24.737 --> 18:26.239
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.474
[electric guitar droning]

18:27.474 --> 18:30.477
NOW, WE'RE GOING
WITH THE SWEET LOVE SONG, RIGHT?

18:30.477 --> 18:31.911
- RIGHT.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.180
- NOT THE ROCKING LOVE SONG.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.281
- NO ROCK!

18:34.281 --> 18:36.015
JUST LOVE.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.817
NOW, GO GET YOUR BIRD.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.419
- RIGHT.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.855
[knocking on door]

18:48.295 --> 18:49.496
- HEY.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.963
- HEY.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.432
IS THAT BABYLACE?

18:52.432 --> 18:54.201
[electric guitar flourish]

18:54.201 --> 18:55.735
- YEAH.

18:55.735 --> 18:59.739
AND, UH, I HAVEN'T BEEN
THE BEST WITH WORDS TODAY,

18:59.739 --> 19:03.210
SO I WANTED TO TRY
AND DO BETTER WITH A SONG.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.477
- YES.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.214
WE HAVE WRITTEN IT
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.650
AND IT STARTS LIKE THIS.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.852
[gentle guitar chord]

19:12.852 --> 19:14.521
HEART ATTACK.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.425
[crashing]

19:18.425 --> 19:19.992
- OH, COME ON.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.694
NURSE.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.230
- YEP.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.231
[paddles powering up]

19:24.231 --> 19:25.298
HEY, JO.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.299
CLEAR!

19:26.299 --> 19:27.300
[zapping]
- OH!

19:27.300 --> 19:28.401
DID THE SONG WORK?

19:28.401 --> 19:29.902
- WE HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET.
- OH.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.304
- WE WERE GONNA PLAY YOU A SONG

19:31.304 --> 19:34.140
THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU FORGET ABOUT
THE THINGS THAT I SAID AND DID,

19:34.140 --> 19:35.675
BUT HE KEEPS DYING.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.676
- SORRY.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.744
- WE GOT TO START OVER.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.546
LOOK, WE NEED TO START OVER.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.816
LOOK, BABY...

19:43.816 --> 19:47.454
YOU AND I COULD JUST...

19:47.454 --> 19:49.889
START OVER.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.658
- HOW DO WE DO THAT?

19:57.497 --> 20:00.667
I NOTICED THAT YOU JUST MOVED
INTO THE PALMWOODS.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.702
WOULD YOU...

20:02.702 --> 20:04.737
LIKE TO GO OUT SOMETIME?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.839
LIKE, TONIGHT?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.378
- THAT SOUNDS REALLY NICE.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.980
- DADDY'S SO PROUD OF YOU.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.916
- HE'S NOT MY DAD.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.251
- OKAY, GREAT.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.786
YOU'RE SMOOSHY-SMOOSHY AGAIN.

20:19.786 --> 20:20.920
YOU GET DRESSED.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.255
YOU GET JAMES AND CARLOS,

20:22.255 --> 20:24.190
AND LET'S GET HIM
TO THE HALL OF ROCK AWARDS.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.725
- HALL OF ROCK!
- LET'S GO!

20:27.694 --> 20:31.130
- THIS IS SUCH AN HONOR!
THANK YOU!

20:31.130 --> 20:33.766
[applause]

20:33.766 --> 20:36.202
- OKAY, PUPPY DOG GOES ON
IN 30 SECONDS,

20:36.202 --> 20:37.570
BUT WE STILL HAVE NO BABYLACE.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.171
REPEAT, NO BABYLACE.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.407
- WELL, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

20:40.407 --> 20:41.874
IF THE DOGS CAN'T GET HIM HERE,

20:41.874 --> 20:45.512
AT LEAST WE CAN'T GET FIRED.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.546
- YEAH!

20:46.546 --> 20:48.281
- HERE HE IS.
HERE HE IS.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.416
WE GOT HIM.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.184
AND HE'S ALIVE.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.288
- WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
THE BEST BABYSITTERS EVER.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.289
- OH, YEAH?

20:56.289 --> 20:58.057

20:58.057 --> 20:59.359
