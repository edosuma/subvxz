WEBVTT

00:06.304 --> 00:08.397
l mean, l can understand
David's motivation.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.034
After all, he and Ray have
never been the best of friends,

00:11.076 --> 00:12.543
but how could Clare
do this to me?

00:12.577 --> 00:13.976
Do what? She's been involved

00:14.012 --> 00:15.536
with The Peach Pit After Dark
since the beginning.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.276
So that makes it okay to help
Valerie find a new house band?

00:18.383 --> 00:20.214
Valerie said it was
Ray's decision to go.

00:20.251 --> 00:21.980
You know what?
l don't know what to think.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.453
l just... l feel

00:23.488 --> 00:24.955
-so betrayed.
-Oh!

00:24.989 --> 00:26.286
And clumsy, too, l bet.

00:26.358 --> 00:27.552
Does anyone have a napkin?

00:27.592 --> 00:28.684
l'll get it.
Don't worry about it.

00:28.727 --> 00:29.716
l'm sorry. Thank you.

00:29.761 --> 00:30.887
No problem.

00:30.929 --> 00:32.590
Hey, campers.

00:32.630 --> 00:34.791
-What's the rumpus?
-So Mr. President,

00:34.833 --> 00:36.266
on behalf
of the female population

00:36.301 --> 00:38.565
on this campus, what is
going on with the rapist?

00:38.603 --> 00:39.831
l wish l knew.

00:39.871 --> 00:41.099
Come on, what's the deal?
You know what's

00:41.139 --> 00:42.834
-going on.
-All right, this isn't

00:42.874 --> 00:46.241
for publication, but the guy
that they brought in

00:46.277 --> 00:47.835
ain't the guy.

00:47.879 --> 00:49.904
Well, where does that leave us?

00:49.948 --> 00:51.711
Afraid to walk
across campus.

00:51.750 --> 00:52.808
Well, not for long.

00:52.851 --> 00:54.250
The lnterfraternity Council

00:54.285 --> 00:57.186
is organizing an escort service
for damsels in distress.

00:57.222 --> 00:59.087
This is really scary.
l mean, they've got to beef up

00:59.124 --> 01:00.785
the security parking
and get better lighting.

01:00.825 --> 01:02.622
You're not the only one
that feels like that, Andrea.

01:02.660 --> 01:03.854
And believe me,
the student senate's

01:03.895 --> 01:05.055
going to get all over it today.

01:06.631 --> 01:09.259
My fan club always
tracks me down.

01:09.334 --> 01:10.460
lt's not me.

01:11.669 --> 01:14.365
Oh. lt's, uh, my beeper.

01:14.406 --> 01:16.271
-Your beeper?
-Steve, didn't you hear?

01:16.374 --> 01:17.807
Andrea's been moonlighting
as a crack dealer.

01:17.842 --> 01:19.400
Stop. lt's work.

01:19.444 --> 01:21.537
The hospital beeps me when
they want me, and l go running.

01:21.579 --> 01:23.171
Oh, your job sounds exciting.

01:24.916 --> 01:28.044
Well, it's got its moments.

01:32.524 --> 01:33.650
Miss me?

01:33.691 --> 01:35.352
l thought you'd never get here.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.188 --> 03:11.917
-All right, yeah...
-Guys!

03:11.956 --> 03:13.253
-Stop!
-Hello!

03:13.291 --> 03:14.781
-Stop!
-Enough!

03:15.927 --> 03:17.554
That's enough, we, uh...

03:17.595 --> 03:19.927
we get the idea.

03:25.703 --> 03:27.671
Thanks, guys, that was great.

03:27.705 --> 03:28.763
We'll let you know.

03:28.806 --> 03:29.932
Next!

03:29.974 --> 03:31.271
Geez.

03:31.342 --> 03:33.469
So you didn't like them,
did you?

03:33.511 --> 03:35.809
Well, they were better
than the last four.

03:35.847 --> 03:37.075
Oh, that's saying a lot.

03:37.115 --> 03:39.743
And what is this?

03:39.784 --> 03:40.910
l think it's their way

03:40.952 --> 03:43.079
of keeping the spirit
of Woodstock alive.

03:52.964 --> 03:54.795
l really appreciate
you coming down here.

03:54.832 --> 03:56.026
Oh, no problem, man.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.092
l knew the charges
would turn out to be bogus.

03:58.136 --> 03:59.660
Like l was going
to let you drift.

03:59.704 --> 04:01.365
Thanks.

04:02.407 --> 04:05.069
You're a good friend,
David.

04:05.109 --> 04:07.577
l want to be honest with you.

04:07.612 --> 04:10.706
About what?

04:10.748 --> 04:14.741
Just after Desert Storm,
l was stationed at Fort Bragg.

04:14.786 --> 04:16.378
Hell, everyone
was acting crazy;

04:16.421 --> 04:18.149
we'd just been
in a damn holy war.

04:18.189 --> 04:20.918
l can't imagine
what that must be like.

04:20.959 --> 04:25.896
Yeah, well... l was on leave
with some guys from my unit,

04:25.930 --> 04:27.693
and, uh, you know,

04:27.732 --> 04:30.758
we were drinking and trolling
the streets for hookers, and...

04:30.802 --> 04:34.101
l was so wasted, l-l can't even
really say what happened next.

04:34.138 --> 04:37.869
l guess some of the guys
got a little gung ho.

04:40.244 --> 04:44.613
All l know is, l woke up
the next day in a cell...

04:44.649 --> 04:45.980
arrested for rape.

04:46.017 --> 04:48.417
You're kidding.

04:48.453 --> 04:52.617
Oh, man, l wish l were.

04:52.657 --> 04:55.182
lt all got plea-bargained
down to sexual assault,

04:55.226 --> 04:59.287
but... it's on my record, man.

04:59.397 --> 05:03.424
l'm...

05:03.468 --> 05:05.459
l'm a registered sex offender.

05:07.605 --> 05:10.472
l did two years
in a federal brig,

05:10.508 --> 05:14.945
and l got out, determined
to make something of my life.

05:14.979 --> 05:16.810
Well, look, l'm sorry
to hear about all that,

05:16.848 --> 05:19.339
but l mean, you have made
something with your life.

05:19.384 --> 05:20.578
You were on the dean's list

05:20.618 --> 05:21.778
last semester.

05:21.819 --> 05:26.017
Every time
someone commits a sex crime,

05:26.057 --> 05:27.888
you can bet
they're going to haul me in.

05:27.925 --> 05:31.486
Look, man, don't worry about it.
All right?

05:31.529 --> 05:32.757
lt's all over.

05:32.797 --> 05:34.196
Nobody has to know about this.

05:34.232 --> 05:36.257
Yeah.

05:38.269 --> 05:41.170
l'm all for prison reform

05:41.205 --> 05:43.230
and rehabilitation, but...

05:43.274 --> 05:45.834
when a convicted sex offender
like Lenny Zeminski

05:45.877 --> 05:47.401
is admitted to this campus,

05:47.445 --> 05:49.504
it is indicative of
the lack of respect

05:49.547 --> 05:51.174
-you people have for women.
-Yes, thank you.

05:52.216 --> 05:54.514
Janice, l thought we agreed

05:54.552 --> 05:56.247
to protect
that man's right to privacy

05:56.287 --> 05:57.447
by not naming names.

05:57.488 --> 05:58.716
l didn't start the leak.

05:58.756 --> 05:59.848
Everyone already knew.

05:59.891 --> 06:01.449
Well, that is unfortunate

06:01.492 --> 06:03.187
because he's
no longer a suspect.

06:03.227 --> 06:04.694
That's just because
they couldn't come up

06:04.729 --> 06:06.219
with enough evidence
to hold him.

06:06.330 --> 06:08.798
No, no, no, the suspect had
an alibi that checked out,

06:08.833 --> 06:12.360
and the victim was
positive it wasn't him.

06:12.403 --> 06:15.201
So, the rapist could
still be on the campus.

06:15.239 --> 06:16.934
Brandon, let's not fuel the fire
with reckless speculation.

06:16.974 --> 06:19.534
What's so reckless about
assuming if there's one rape,

06:19.577 --> 06:20.544
there could be another?

06:20.578 --> 06:23.570
And another
and another and another.

06:23.614 --> 06:25.445
Look, look, people!

06:25.483 --> 06:28.008
Lieutenant Smith and l
are here today to assure you

06:28.052 --> 06:29.781
that we are doing everything
within our power

06:29.821 --> 06:32.051
to make sure it is business
as usual on this campus.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.752
With all due respect, sir,

06:34.792 --> 06:37.784
''business as usual''
usually means cutbacks

06:37.829 --> 06:40.525
and no student involvement
in the decision-making process.

06:40.565 --> 06:42.499
Right.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.866
Now, l-l don't want to,
l don't want to grandstand here,

06:45.903 --> 06:48.269
but two months ago,
we unanimously passed

06:48.339 --> 06:51.137
a ten-point program
to improve campus security.

06:51.175 --> 06:52.574
-What happened to that?
-Yes, but unfortunately,

06:52.610 --> 06:54.271
you-you gave us
no recommendations

06:54.312 --> 06:55.779
on how to fund your program,

06:55.813 --> 06:58.714
and you'd be all over us if
it meant raising your tuition.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.445
Nonetheless, at this point,

07:00.485 --> 07:03.454
what Janice and Patricia
want to know is:

07:03.488 --> 07:06.218
Do the police have
any suspects or any leads?

07:10.161 --> 07:14.188
Well, that about sums it up,
doesn't it?

07:18.269 --> 07:20.829
Whoa, Charlie,
what are you doing?

07:20.872 --> 07:22.396
This is almost
the 21 st century, man.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.931
You gotta embrace
the technology.

07:24.976 --> 07:27.706
No, no, no. Can you imagine
Raymond Chandler on a laptop?

07:27.745 --> 07:29.770
Actually,
come to think of it, no.

07:29.814 --> 07:31.213
-Yeah.
-So what are you writing--

07:31.249 --> 07:33.809
-the great American screenplay?
-Nope.

07:33.851 --> 07:35.944
A serious writer never tells
what he's working on.

07:35.987 --> 07:37.648
l can respect that.

07:37.688 --> 07:39.849
Well, you're not even going
to ask what it's about?

07:39.891 --> 07:40.823
l thought l already did.

07:40.858 --> 07:42.826
Yeah, yeah, you did, didn't you?

07:42.860 --> 07:46.125
Well, let's see, without getting
too far into the plot, uh...

07:46.164 --> 07:47.995
you know, it starts
off like your basic

07:48.032 --> 07:50.262
hard-boiled detective story

07:50.301 --> 07:52.462
until the main character
starts having these really...

07:52.503 --> 07:55.472
radical dreams
about his past lives.

07:56.574 --> 07:57.802
l've lost you already, right?

07:57.842 --> 07:59.969
No, you didn't lose me.

08:00.011 --> 08:01.638
l think
that's pretty interesting.

08:01.679 --> 08:06.446
Yeah, well, um, you know,
make yourself at home.

08:06.484 --> 08:08.543
You could help with
the screenplay if you want to.

08:08.586 --> 08:09.553
Really?

08:09.587 --> 08:10.918
Mm-hmm.

08:10.955 --> 08:12.513
Okay.

08:12.557 --> 08:15.890
Yeah, l'll, uh, l'll have a
look at it, see what l can do.

08:15.927 --> 08:21.866
Well, uh... you know, this place
is really conducive to writers.

08:21.899 --> 08:24.060
The phone never rings.

08:24.101 --> 08:25.796
-Hmm.
-Everybody who stays here,

08:25.837 --> 08:27.862
doesn't want to be bothered...
if you get my drift.

08:27.905 --> 08:29.065
Oh, yeah.

08:29.106 --> 08:30.971
lt's your basic no-tell motel.

08:31.008 --> 08:33.533
People who stay here
stay under assumed names.

08:33.578 --> 08:34.567
Like these two...

08:35.746 --> 08:37.770
Look at her.

08:37.815 --> 08:40.648
She's trying to be casual,
she's hoping nobody sees her.

08:40.684 --> 08:42.710
30 seconds later,
he comes out of the same room,

08:42.753 --> 08:44.880
they act like they don't know
each other, and they drive off

08:44.922 --> 08:46.685
in different directions.

08:46.724 --> 08:48.624
lt's pretty wild, huh?

08:48.659 --> 08:49.819
Have you ever seen them before?

08:49.861 --> 08:50.828
Just the guy.

08:50.862 --> 08:52.261
He paid for the week.

08:52.363 --> 08:54.092
You know he's getting
his money's worth.

09:02.506 --> 09:04.474
Hey, Nat.

09:04.508 --> 09:06.635
Where are you going
with all that food?

09:06.677 --> 09:08.770
The empress ordered
room service.

09:08.813 --> 09:11.543
Oh, well, will you tell her
l'm still waiting out here?

09:11.582 --> 09:12.606
Will do.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.641
Thank you.

09:15.853 --> 09:17.684
Hey, there.

09:17.722 --> 09:18.882
Hello.

09:18.923 --> 09:22.586
Oh, you work
at the Condor's Nest, right?

09:22.627 --> 09:24.219
-Yeah, l do.
-l thought so.

09:24.262 --> 09:26.822
You cleaned up my mess today.

09:26.864 --> 09:28.695
Oh, right, right.

09:28.733 --> 09:29.927
Uh, are you Clare?

09:29.967 --> 09:31.161
No, l'm Donna.

09:31.202 --> 09:34.603
She's my roommate...
possible ex-roommate.

09:34.639 --> 09:36.607
l was hoping l could talk
to her about getting a job

09:36.641 --> 09:37.835
around here.

09:37.875 --> 09:39.467
Oh, well, Valerie's
in charge now.

09:39.510 --> 09:41.068
Oh, is she nice?

09:41.112 --> 09:42.704
Nice?

09:42.747 --> 09:46.706
Um... l don't really know
how to answer that question.

09:46.751 --> 09:48.241
Okay.

09:48.319 --> 09:51.618
Uh, do you happen to know
if she's hiring?

09:51.656 --> 09:53.851
Sorry, l don't know
that answer either.

09:55.860 --> 09:56.827
You're up.

09:56.861 --> 09:58.021
Oh, thanks, Nat.

09:58.062 --> 09:59.051
You want to go first?

09:59.096 --> 10:00.996
Oh, no, that's okay.

10:01.032 --> 10:03.057
Be sure to put in
a good word for me.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.965
Sure... um, l don't know
your name, though.

10:05.002 --> 10:05.991
Oh, Garret.

10:06.037 --> 10:07.129
Garret Slan.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.071
Well, l'll see
what we can do, Garret.

10:09.106 --> 10:10.733
Thanks... Donna.

10:10.775 --> 10:12.902
Won't take long.

10:21.419 --> 10:23.910
Help yourself;
l ordered way too much food.

10:23.955 --> 10:25.286
-Valerie...
-Uh, listen, l'm really glad

10:25.389 --> 10:26.913
you stopped by.

10:26.958 --> 10:28.653
l feel like l've been
flying solo here,

10:28.693 --> 10:30.524
and l could really use
your help. Besides,

10:30.561 --> 10:31.994
l want you
to hear my new message,

10:32.029 --> 10:34.463
and you tell me
what you think. Okay?

10:36.467 --> 10:37.661
Hey, After Darkers.

10:37.702 --> 10:39.670
A major recording artist
will be here Friday night.

10:39.704 --> 10:43.299
l could tell you who, but it
wouldn't be any fun, would it?

10:43.374 --> 10:45.171
Anyway, you know where
to find us and you know when.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.733
After Dark.
When else?

10:46.777 --> 10:48.608
Huh.

10:48.646 --> 10:49.613
So...

10:49.647 --> 10:51.012
what do you think?

10:51.048 --> 10:53.448
l think you're
an incredibly cruel human being.

10:53.484 --> 10:55.384
What are you talking about?

10:58.723 --> 11:00.691
Ray should be playing here
Friday night,

11:00.725 --> 11:02.750
and he would be
if you hadn't cut him loose.

11:02.793 --> 11:04.886
Cut him loose?

11:04.929 --> 11:06.123
Did he say l did that?

11:06.163 --> 11:07.255
Not in so many words.

11:07.331 --> 11:08.628
Look, Donna,

11:08.666 --> 11:11.100
l didn't start
the dump Ray campaign.

11:11.135 --> 11:12.966
l mean, David said that
the club would die

11:13.004 --> 11:14.528
if we didn't get some
new blood in here.

11:14.572 --> 11:16.233
David said that?

11:16.273 --> 11:18.741
Yeah. l'm just as
surprised as you are.

11:18.776 --> 11:21.745
Look, l like Ray,
and l love his music.

11:21.779 --> 11:25.715
But when you think about it,
how is an artist going to grow

11:25.750 --> 11:28.150
if he keeps playing the
same club week after week?

11:28.185 --> 11:31.848
Well... l guess you're right.

11:31.889 --> 11:34.016
Believe me,
Ray needed to get out of here.

11:34.058 --> 11:36.891
And you need to start
eating some of this food

11:36.927 --> 11:38.485
before l pig out.

11:39.797 --> 11:42.425
Well, l guess
l am a little hungry.

11:42.466 --> 11:43.763
Oh, uh, l almost forgot.

11:43.801 --> 11:45.792
There's a guy outside,
he's looking for a job.

11:45.836 --> 11:47.394
-ls he cute?
-He seems nice.

11:47.438 --> 11:48.871
He works
at the Condor's Nest.

11:48.906 --> 11:51.067
Okay, let's
go get him.

11:51.108 --> 11:53.167
Garret.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.541
Garret?

11:55.713 --> 11:58.181
He must have gone.

11:58.215 --> 12:00.410
Hey, where's my backpack?

12:00.451 --> 12:02.578
Donna, it's right there,
below the speaker.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.850
Oh.

12:04.889 --> 12:07.619
Yeah, but l had it
up here on the speaker.

12:07.658 --> 12:08.852
Well, is everything in it?

12:08.893 --> 12:11.088
l hope so.

12:11.128 --> 12:12.993
Well, l wouldn't
make too much of it.

12:13.998 --> 12:15.124
Yeah, you're right.

12:15.166 --> 12:16.565
l've just been
a little freaked out

12:16.600 --> 12:19.034
ever since that girl
was raped on campus.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.470
Yeah, you, me and
everybody else.

12:21.505 --> 12:24.099
Well, let's go eat lunch
before it gets cold.

12:41.058 --> 12:43.049
Oh, boy.

12:44.462 --> 12:47.431
Hey, so you teeing off
from the mathematics building?

12:47.465 --> 12:49.763
l wish. No, we're just giving
rides to women around campus

12:49.800 --> 12:50.892
so they don't have to worry

12:50.935 --> 12:52.664
about any psychos
lurking in the bushes.

12:52.703 --> 12:54.034
Very noble.

12:54.071 --> 12:55.129
l feel safe already.

12:55.172 --> 12:56.298
Can l get a lift?

12:56.407 --> 12:58.398
-Yeah, hop in.
-Okay.

13:01.812 --> 13:04.144
Oh, very comfy.

13:04.181 --> 13:05.648
Well,

13:05.683 --> 13:08.151
unfortunately, to get this cart
from Rush's country club,

13:08.185 --> 13:10.176
l had to promise to play
a tournament with him

13:10.221 --> 13:11.210
in Palm Springs.

13:11.255 --> 13:14.088
Oh, life is full
of little compromises.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.422
Well, that's funny. l thought

13:15.459 --> 13:17.154
life was like a
box of chocolates.

13:18.162 --> 13:19.789
What are you doing on campus?

13:19.830 --> 13:22.264
Honestly, l came to see you.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.528
l'm kind of in a bind
with the club, and...

13:24.568 --> 13:25.865
No way, Valerie.

13:25.903 --> 13:27.268
You don't even know what l want.

13:27.338 --> 13:28.635
Valerie, look,

13:28.672 --> 13:30.037
l'm a sensitive guy.

13:30.074 --> 13:32.872
l can't go on another
roller coaster ride with you.

13:32.910 --> 13:35.845
Look, Steve, l don't have
a replacement band for Ray.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.404
Well, l thought
you were auditioning acts.

13:37.448 --> 13:39.382
They all sucked,
and every major band l tried for

13:39.416 --> 13:41.077
just kind of laughed at me.

13:41.118 --> 13:43.245
Well, that's showbiz.

13:43.287 --> 13:45.915
Look, l wouldn't be asking
if l wasn't desperate.

13:45.956 --> 13:47.218
Thanks.

13:47.258 --> 13:50.955
No, l mean, l promised
this big mystery act, and...

13:50.995 --> 13:52.826
l don't think l can deliver.

13:52.863 --> 13:54.296
But you know
l can't get involved.

13:54.331 --> 13:56.731
Steve, come on. l mean,
you've got great contacts.

13:56.767 --> 13:57.756
l mean, you knew Jade,

13:57.801 --> 13:59.701
you, you hung out
with the Stones.

13:59.737 --> 14:02.604
lf you can do this for me,
l'll make it worth your while.

14:03.974 --> 14:05.635
Look out! Oh, my...!

14:09.046 --> 14:10.513
All right, Valerie.

14:10.548 --> 14:12.641
l'll tell you what, l'll get
back to you on that, okay?

14:12.683 --> 14:14.378
Look, l need a big name
for tonight.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.385
Oh, tonight?

14:15.419 --> 14:16.716
Oh, great, nothing like no time

14:16.754 --> 14:18.085
to put the pressure on me.

14:19.056 --> 14:20.717
Thanks.

14:20.758 --> 14:22.248
l think this is my stop.

14:27.831 --> 14:31.323
Look, l didn't touch the girl,
so just leave me alone.

14:46.517 --> 14:48.951
Whoa, man,
you all right?

14:48.986 --> 14:50.977
l think so.

14:52.489 --> 14:54.480
You take it easy.

15:09.306 --> 15:11.137
Good afternoon, Ms. Zuckerman.

15:11.175 --> 15:14.235
Hey, well, l think
l like seeing this,

15:14.345 --> 15:16.245
seeing you on campus again.

15:16.347 --> 15:18.178
Thinking of matriculating,
are we?

15:18.215 --> 15:19.648
No, not a chance,

15:19.683 --> 15:21.674
but there are some things here
that l definitely like.

15:21.719 --> 15:22.845
For instance,
the campus bookstore.

15:22.886 --> 15:24.012
l just spent two hours

15:24.054 --> 15:25.885
browsing in the psychology
section alone.

15:25.923 --> 15:27.891
l see, that's why you
invited me here today--

15:27.925 --> 15:29.756
so that you could borrow
my student discount card.

15:29.793 --> 15:30.760
ls that it?

15:30.794 --> 15:31.920
No.

15:31.962 --> 15:33.896
l just figured it was better
to see you here

15:33.931 --> 15:36.092
than at the Palm Wind Motel.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.704
Relax.

15:41.739 --> 15:44.003
Nobody knows
but me.

15:55.719 --> 15:58.017
lt's not what you think,
Dylan.

16:00.891 --> 16:02.552
l'm, l'm in love with him.

16:02.593 --> 16:05.118
And love won't be denied.

16:05.162 --> 16:08.928
Something like that.

16:08.966 --> 16:11.730
ls Jesse happy
about it?

16:11.769 --> 16:13.999
Okay... look, it's
none of my business.

16:14.038 --> 16:16.233
lf you don't ever want me
to bring it up again,

16:16.307 --> 16:17.331
just say so.

16:18.375 --> 16:21.344
Look, this wasn't...

16:21.378 --> 16:24.245
this wasn't something
that l planned.

16:24.348 --> 16:26.782
l mean, l met
this amazingly charming,

16:26.817 --> 16:29.684
sensitive, loving guy.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.745
l mean, it was like a miracle.

16:31.789 --> 16:32.983
What am l supposed to do?

16:33.023 --> 16:34.923
Turn my back on my feelings?

16:34.958 --> 16:38.917
lt just seems that sneaking
around is not the best way

16:38.962 --> 16:40.930
to build a solid relationship.

16:41.965 --> 16:44.798
This is the, uh...

16:44.835 --> 16:46.598
voice of experience
speaking, huh?

16:46.637 --> 16:48.161
No, Andrea, l'm not
here to judge you.

16:48.205 --> 16:50.605
l just wanted to let
you know that l know.

16:50.641 --> 16:53.804
That way, if you want to
talk about it, we can talk.

16:53.844 --> 16:55.641
End of story, okay?

16:57.681 --> 17:01.583
Okay.

17:01.618 --> 17:04.519
End of story.

17:10.527 --> 17:11.493
Hey.

17:11.528 --> 17:12.517
Have you heard?

17:12.563 --> 17:14.827
Senor Perverto is moving out.

17:27.111 --> 17:29.978
Lenny, what's going on?

17:30.013 --> 17:33.141
Simple. l'm getting
out of Dodge City.

17:33.183 --> 17:34.810
Why? You were cleared.

17:34.852 --> 17:38.015
l mean, who cares what girls
like Amy Houseman have to say?

17:38.055 --> 17:40.250
You have a right to be here.

17:40.324 --> 17:42.690
Why don't you try walking
across campus with me?

17:42.726 --> 17:45.524
lt feels like everyone knows
who l am and what l did.

17:45.562 --> 17:47.996
The best thing for me is
to slink out the back door

17:48.031 --> 17:49.555
and not come back.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.192
lt's funny,
but l think the best thing

17:51.235 --> 17:52.202
for you to do is fight.

17:52.236 --> 17:53.669
You have rights.

17:53.704 --> 17:56.172
Maybe l don't want
to be the poster child

17:56.206 --> 17:57.764
for ex-con rights.
Okay?

17:57.808 --> 18:00.174
Look, Lenny, l understand
what you're going through.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.177
All right?

18:01.211 --> 18:02.803
But l have a lot of pull
on this campus.

18:02.846 --> 18:04.040
l mean,
l know all the media people.

18:04.081 --> 18:05.378
l mean, hell,

18:05.416 --> 18:07.213
the student body president
is one of my best friends.

18:07.317 --> 18:11.117
Look, l appreciate the concern,
l really do, but...

18:11.155 --> 18:12.645
But what?

18:14.458 --> 18:17.086
There's just some other
stuff going on here.

18:17.127 --> 18:21.154
So just let it die, will you?

18:21.198 --> 18:22.165
What other stuff?

18:22.199 --> 18:25.600
Look... l can't talk about it.

18:25.636 --> 18:26.694
Okay?

18:26.737 --> 18:29.228
Are you trying to tell me
you did it?

18:32.943 --> 18:34.911
What if l did?

18:34.945 --> 18:37.140
You know, when you've
been in prison,

18:37.181 --> 18:39.513
you find out that
even the guilty need someone

18:39.550 --> 18:40.915
to believe in them.

18:41.952 --> 18:45.046
Then let me talk to some people.

18:45.088 --> 18:46.919
Just give me a day
to work on this.

18:46.957 --> 18:48.948
All right?

18:56.099 --> 18:57.896
Valerie.

18:57.935 --> 18:58.902
Valerie, it's me,

18:58.936 --> 19:00.267
Mr. Showbiz.

19:01.438 --> 19:03.998
Uh, just a second, Steve.

19:04.041 --> 19:07.306
Oh, boy, have l got
an act for you.

19:07.344 --> 19:09.039
Ah... can you come back
a little bit later?

19:09.079 --> 19:10.444
Come back?

19:10.481 --> 19:11.675
You're not going to believe
who l'm talking to.

19:11.715 --> 19:12.773
Uh...

19:12.816 --> 19:14.010
l'm in the middle
of a situation.

19:14.051 --> 19:15.746
-Who's that?
-lt's Arnold Dickey

19:15.786 --> 19:17.185
from the Morris office.

19:17.221 --> 19:19.212
lt is so cool who he's got
lined up to play tonight.

19:19.256 --> 19:20.621
Yeah, but l...

19:20.657 --> 19:22.682
You're a sweetheart, thanks.

19:27.030 --> 19:29.260
l hate her.

19:33.403 --> 19:35.667
Hey, anybody home?

19:39.009 --> 19:40.977
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:41.011 --> 19:42.672
lt's about time you showed
your handsome face

19:42.713 --> 19:43.680
around here.

19:43.714 --> 19:45.443
What's with the bat?

19:45.482 --> 19:47.541
Oh, Donna--
Alpha softball team.

19:47.584 --> 19:48.608
Come here.

19:48.652 --> 19:52.918
Absence makes the
heart grow fonder.

19:52.956 --> 19:55.117
Hey, is that the
best you can do?

19:55.158 --> 19:56.989
Look, sorry,
l'm on a tight deadline.

19:57.027 --> 19:59.825
Walter Chen agreed to let me
produce a profile on Lenny.

19:59.863 --> 20:02.058
''Rehabilitated Criminal:
A Student.''

20:02.099 --> 20:03.157
He did?

20:03.200 --> 20:06.499
Yeah, with the help
of you or Donna.

20:06.537 --> 20:09.097
l think l'll have to
pass-a-dena on that one.

20:09.139 --> 20:11.073
Oh, come on, Clare,
the guy deserves some respect.

20:11.108 --> 20:12.700
l mean, some of the
students on campus

20:12.743 --> 20:14.267
are actually trying
to run him out of town.

20:14.378 --> 20:15.811
No, David, the guy
has a history

20:15.846 --> 20:17.507
of violence against
women, all right?

20:17.548 --> 20:19.516
lf he wants to go
into higher learning,

20:19.550 --> 20:22.178
let him do it in an
estrogen-free environment.

20:22.219 --> 20:23.243
You know,
sometimes l wish your heart

20:23.287 --> 20:24.948
was as big as your mouth.

20:24.988 --> 20:26.455
l'll remember that.

20:26.490 --> 20:29.891
Donna, come on, let's go.

20:29.927 --> 20:31.656
Hey, Donna.

20:32.663 --> 20:35.291
What, now you want to make nice?

20:35.365 --> 20:37.094
-What'd l do wrong?
-Right, David.

20:37.134 --> 20:38.999
Don't play innocent
like it's not your fault

20:39.036 --> 20:41.061
that Ray is not playing
at the Peach Pit anymore.

20:41.104 --> 20:42.628
Are you on medication
or something?

20:42.673 --> 20:45.107
Get out of my apartment, please.

20:45.142 --> 20:46.734
You know, after all
that's happened,

20:46.777 --> 20:48.574
l can't believe
l even promised Valerie

20:48.612 --> 20:50.307
l'd go to the club tonight.

20:50.414 --> 20:51.904
Clare, what's going on here?

20:51.949 --> 20:53.439
l'm not getting involved.

20:55.085 --> 20:56.416
-Donna, look.
-No!

20:56.453 --> 20:57.681
No ''looks.''

20:57.721 --> 20:59.518
You sandbagged
Ray with Valerie

20:59.556 --> 21:01.456
because you're jealous that
he has a band and you don't!

21:01.491 --> 21:03.618
No, no! Why don't you just slow
yourself down, all right?!

21:03.660 --> 21:05.628
l'm here just to help
an innocent guy catch a break,

21:05.662 --> 21:07.129
and you're sitting here,
yelling at me

21:07.164 --> 21:08.358
-about something that didn't...
-David, look!

21:08.398 --> 21:09.592
No, you look, all right?

21:09.633 --> 21:11.157
You've become
such a self-involved bitch,

21:11.201 --> 21:13.669
such a pale version
of what you used to be!

21:14.938 --> 21:16.269
l don't know
what l ever saw in you

21:16.306 --> 21:17.500
in the first place.

21:48.472 --> 21:49.666
So l went through
my little black book,

21:49.706 --> 21:50.866
and l found some good names.

21:50.907 --> 21:52.033
Well, l'm not worried
about their names.

21:52.075 --> 21:53.167
How are their bods?

21:53.210 --> 21:55.474
Well, they're not quite
fabulous at 40--

21:55.512 --> 21:57.309
or 50 for that matter--
but not bad.

21:57.347 --> 21:58.314
Do they have hair?

21:58.415 --> 21:59.905
-On their heads?
-Oh, God.

21:59.950 --> 22:01.076
This is as gruesome

22:01.118 --> 22:02.881
as l thought it was going to be.

22:02.919 --> 22:05.080
Did anyone ever tell you
you have a rotten attitude?

22:05.122 --> 22:07.147
Oh, no, no, no.
l have experience.

22:07.190 --> 22:09.886
l have been married four times.

22:10.961 --> 22:11.928
Don't worry, Jackie,

22:11.962 --> 22:13.259
we'll find you a man.

22:13.363 --> 22:15.092
Look who's here!

22:15.132 --> 22:16.258
Erin!

22:16.333 --> 22:17.925
Mommy.

22:17.968 --> 22:20.266
Oh, what a wonderful surprise!

22:20.303 --> 22:21.634
What do you have?

22:21.672 --> 22:24.140
l got Lion King pencils.

22:24.174 --> 22:25.937
Lion King pencils and puppets

22:25.976 --> 22:28.672
and stickers
and Lion King pajamas.

22:28.712 --> 22:30.737
Well, it's nice to see
you come so prepared.

22:30.781 --> 22:32.772
lt's nice to see you, too.

22:34.184 --> 22:37.278
Mel, why don't you join us?

22:39.756 --> 22:40.984
You sure?

22:41.024 --> 22:43.424
Uh... Cindy, you know that book?

22:43.460 --> 22:45.519
We won't be needing that
tonight.

22:50.400 --> 22:54.461
Hey, Sanders,
is that you on TV?

22:54.504 --> 22:57.473
The police department refuses
to comment on the progress

22:57.507 --> 23:01.068
of their investigation into the
rape on the CU campus last week.

23:01.111 --> 23:02.772
University public...

23:02.813 --> 23:05.373
That's because they still don't
have a clue who this guy is.

23:05.415 --> 23:06.939
...flatly denied accusations
that the school...

23:36.446 --> 23:39.973
Well, Janice, that's very
nice of you to say, but...

23:40.016 --> 23:42.507
Honestly l'm not even thinking
about running for president

23:42.552 --> 23:44.315
again next year.

23:45.789 --> 23:48.883
Well, l'm flattered that you and
Alex would both vote for me,

23:48.925 --> 23:51.860
but one term's been
enough stress for me

23:53.830 --> 23:57.561
No, no, don't do that.

23:57.601 --> 23:59.762
Look-look, l got to go.

23:59.803 --> 24:01.998
Yeah, of course l'm trying
to get rid of you.

24:02.038 --> 24:03.665
All right, talk to you later.
Bye.

24:03.707 --> 24:05.675
Mom, what are you doing home?

24:05.709 --> 24:07.233
l thought you and Jackie
were gonna be wild chicks

24:07.344 --> 24:08.538
out on the town tonight?

24:08.578 --> 24:11.775
Oh, Jackie ran into Mel
at the Peach pit.

24:11.815 --> 24:13.749
ls it the end of civilization
as we know it?

24:13.784 --> 24:16.082
Not exactly. They
actually got quite cozy.

24:16.119 --> 24:17.950
l started to feel like
the odd chick out.

24:17.988 --> 24:20.422
Mel, Jackie, cozy?
What is it, a full moon?

24:20.457 --> 24:21.924
No. Jackie found out

24:21.958 --> 24:24.586
that Mel's girlfriend left
him for a younger dentist.

24:24.628 --> 24:25.925
-Oh.
-She suddenly started

24:25.962 --> 24:27.395
laughing at all his jokes.

24:27.430 --> 24:29.261
That sounds serious.

24:29.366 --> 24:32.995
Actually, l think they're
both quite, uh, motivated.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.401
Now, what's this about you

24:34.437 --> 24:36.405
not running for another
term as president?

24:36.439 --> 24:39.602
Mom, Janice just liked how blunt
l was with the dean, that's all.

24:39.643 --> 24:41.008
You know your father is
gonna be very disappointed

24:41.044 --> 24:42.238
if you don't run.

24:42.279 --> 24:44.406
Mom, curtail the collateral
damage, will you?

24:44.447 --> 24:46.278
Well, can you blame us?

24:46.383 --> 24:47.680
There's a certain cachet

24:47.717 --> 24:49.184
having a president
for a son.

24:50.654 --> 24:52.781
Mom, l like a good cachet
as much as the next guy,

24:52.823 --> 24:56.224
but l think in this case, it's
better to quit while l'm ahead.

25:00.497 --> 25:02.658
-Silver!
-Hey.

25:02.699 --> 25:04.462
To what do l owe
this unexpected honor?

25:04.501 --> 25:06.969
Well Brandon, l, l need
to ask a favor of you.

25:07.003 --> 25:10.234
Oh, come on in, man.
You, uh, want some grub?

25:10.273 --> 25:11.934
No, actually, no, l don't
really have a lot of time.

25:11.975 --> 25:12.942
What's up?

25:12.976 --> 25:14.170
Well, a friend of mine

25:14.211 --> 25:15.576
is planning on dropping
out of school,

25:15.612 --> 25:17.239
and l was hoping maybe you
could talk to him tonight.

25:17.347 --> 25:18.507
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

25:18.548 --> 25:19.640
Well, the problem is,

25:19.683 --> 25:21.412
he might not be here tomorrow.

25:21.451 --> 25:23.248
Uh, it's, it's Lenny Zeminski.

25:23.353 --> 25:25.218
The guy they arrested
for the rape?

25:25.255 --> 25:26.244
They guy they released.

25:26.356 --> 25:28.347
Right.

25:28.391 --> 25:29.983
Sure. No problem.

25:30.026 --> 25:32.187
Great. Thanks a lot, man.

25:32.229 --> 25:34.026
Yeah, you got it.

25:34.064 --> 25:36.123
l really appreciate it.

25:36.166 --> 25:37.155
No sweat.

25:42.005 --> 25:43.370
l don't believe this!

25:43.406 --> 25:45.169
l can't believe you didn't
make the deposit.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.005
Every Thursday, l get a check,
you put it in the bank.

25:47.043 --> 25:48.670
l count on you
to take care of that.

25:48.712 --> 25:50.475
Why does it always
have to be me?

25:50.513 --> 25:52.606
Why can't you make the deposit
once in a while?

25:52.649 --> 25:53.911
That's not the point, Andrea.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.975
l can do it if you can't,
but you got to tell me.

25:56.019 --> 25:57.281
Excuse me, it is not like

25:57.354 --> 25:59.288
you are always
Mr. Reliable yourself.

25:59.389 --> 26:00.981
Oh, oh, what's that
supposed to mean?

26:01.024 --> 26:02.457
lt's supposed to mean
that you've been promising

26:02.492 --> 26:04.517
to hang the towel rack in
the bathroom for weeks now,

26:04.561 --> 26:05.892
not to mention tune up the car.

26:05.929 --> 26:07.760
Oh, here we go again,
tune up the car.

26:07.797 --> 26:09.424
''When are you gonna
tune up the car, Jesse, huh?

26:09.466 --> 26:12.435
When are you gonna
tune up the car?'' You know...

26:12.469 --> 26:14.903
Listen, we're both really busy
people right now, all right?

26:14.938 --> 26:17.930
Let-Let's, let's just talk about
this when l get back, all right?

26:17.974 --> 26:19.908
Get back from where?

26:19.943 --> 26:22.104
Dinner at my mother's, Andrea.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.737
Andrea, l told you about this!

26:23.780 --> 26:25.145
My entire family
is gonna be there!

26:25.181 --> 26:26.648
l am sorry, okay?!

26:26.683 --> 26:28.548
l forgot, you told me,
and l forgot.

26:28.585 --> 26:30.712
lf we're supposed
to go, let's just go.

26:30.754 --> 26:32.381
You know what, don't
do me any favors, okay?

26:32.422 --> 26:34.049
Oh, what, now you're saying
you don't want me to go?

26:34.090 --> 26:35.853
No, no, l don't, not with
that attitude, l sure don't.

26:35.892 --> 26:38.258
Listen, sweetie, why
don't you do me a favor

26:38.361 --> 26:40.022
and take the night off,
all right?

26:40.063 --> 26:41.553
Fine.

26:41.598 --> 26:44.226
And why don't you just bond
with your daughter for a change?

26:55.078 --> 26:56.045
Lenny?

26:56.079 --> 26:57.103
Yeah.

26:57.147 --> 26:58.409
Hi. l'm Brandon Walsh.

26:58.448 --> 26:59.710
Oh, l know who you are.

26:59.749 --> 27:01.011
You're David's friend,
Mr. Student Body,

27:01.051 --> 27:03.212
here to tell me what a
bright future l have at CU.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.483
No, actually, l was going
door to door selling magazines.

27:06.523 --> 27:08.218
Ah, well, l appreciate
you taking the time,

27:08.258 --> 27:09.725
but l was heading out
to buy some smokes.

27:09.759 --> 27:11.158
Mind if l head out with you?

27:11.194 --> 27:12.456
What's the matter?

27:12.495 --> 27:13.962
You don't trust me prowling
around the campus

27:13.997 --> 27:14.964
at night by myself?

27:14.998 --> 27:16.761
You got to be careful.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.028
There's a rapist out there.

27:18.068 --> 27:20.195
All right, let's go.

27:22.739 --> 27:25.230
So, what do you hear
about this investigation?

27:25.342 --> 27:27.071
Not much.

27:27.110 --> 27:29.442
The guy's a psycho--
that much l can tell you.

27:29.479 --> 27:31.470
How do you know that?

27:31.514 --> 27:33.709
When l was in custody,
l heard what he did to Melody.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.047
You knew her?

27:35.085 --> 27:36.780
Yeah.

27:36.820 --> 27:39.084
How do you think
l got off so easily?

27:39.122 --> 27:40.680
She knew it wasn't me.

27:40.724 --> 27:42.589
l got to hope they're
gonna catch this guy.

27:42.625 --> 27:44.024
Yeah, well, don't
get your hopes up.

27:44.060 --> 27:46.028
What do you mean?

27:46.062 --> 27:48.496
The cop that questioned me
was a real lightweight.

27:48.531 --> 27:49.896
There were hundreds of questions

27:49.933 --> 27:51.560
he could've asked me
he didn't think about.

27:51.601 --> 27:53.364
Like what?

27:53.403 --> 27:55.633
Well, l don't want
to get into it.

27:55.672 --> 27:57.663
Then why did you
bring it up?

27:59.075 --> 28:01.066
As president of this school,

28:01.111 --> 28:04.308
what kind of clout do you
carry with these guys?

28:04.347 --> 28:07.009
Well, Dean Whitmore
is a pretty good friend,

28:07.050 --> 28:10.042
and in some circles l'm known
as the chancellor's lackey.

28:10.086 --> 28:11.951
What about the cops?

28:14.958 --> 28:17.188
Do you need to talk to a lawyer?

28:21.898 --> 28:23.229
Do you want one of these?

28:23.299 --> 28:25.426
No, thanks. Lenny,
tell me what you know.

28:28.338 --> 28:30.329
l know who raped Melody.

28:41.117 --> 28:43.017
Oh, great.

28:43.053 --> 28:45.385
Kelly!

28:45.422 --> 28:47.322
Hello?

28:58.835 --> 28:59.859
Hello, Donna.

29:03.706 --> 29:05.105
Help!

29:05.141 --> 29:06.574
Help me!

29:07.577 --> 29:09.875
Don't fight it, don't fight it.

29:09.913 --> 29:11.505
l used to teach self-defense.

29:11.548 --> 29:13.448
Your response time
was a little slow,

29:13.483 --> 29:15.007
though your form was
very impressive.

29:18.054 --> 29:20.522
You might be thinking
about at this time

29:20.557 --> 29:22.684
if this is really gonna happen.

29:22.725 --> 29:23.817
lt is.

29:24.828 --> 29:27.160
lt can happen two ways--

29:27.197 --> 29:29.825
it can be painful and
very... what's the word?

29:29.866 --> 29:32.130
Untidy.

29:32.168 --> 29:33.692
Or it can be pure pleasure.

29:33.736 --> 29:38.036
Now, what's it gonna be, Donna?

29:38.074 --> 29:40.201
-What's it gonna be?
-No!

29:40.243 --> 29:42.973
Okay... now l'm gonna
remove my hand,

29:43.012 --> 29:44.877
and if you make
so much as a sound,

29:44.914 --> 29:46.677
l'm gonna have
to pull out my knife.

29:46.716 --> 29:48.149
Now, things could
get very untidy.

29:48.184 --> 29:51.017
Do you understand?

29:51.054 --> 29:52.351
Garret, please...

29:52.388 --> 29:53.480
Garret's not here.

29:53.523 --> 29:56.583
Call me Warren,
that's my real name.

29:57.927 --> 30:01.124
Aw... oh, you're
even sexier than Clare.

30:02.132 --> 30:03.759
Aw... don't worry.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.233
No, l'm not gonna rush.

30:05.268 --> 30:07.600
l want us to get to know
each other first.

30:08.605 --> 30:10.232
That's a good girl.

30:10.273 --> 30:11.604
Come on. Easy...

30:21.217 --> 30:24.186
You know, l've never been
a big fan of alternative music,

30:24.220 --> 30:25.847
but these guys rocked the house.

30:25.889 --> 30:28.483
Yeah, it was cool to see them
in a small club like this, huh?

30:28.525 --> 30:29.492
Yeah.

30:29.526 --> 30:30.515
Hey, guys.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.686
-Brandon.
-Hey, Mr. Punctuality.

30:31.728 --> 30:32.854
Clare, it looks like

30:32.896 --> 30:34.727
the campus rapist
may be stalking you.

30:34.764 --> 30:36.231
What?

30:36.266 --> 30:38.700
This is Lieutenant Joyce Davis
over here; she's from the LAPD.

30:38.735 --> 30:40.327
She wants to ask you
a few questions.

30:43.673 --> 30:45.197
Boy, you must have had

30:45.241 --> 30:46.640
one hell of a night, huh?

30:46.676 --> 30:47.768
You could say that.

30:47.810 --> 30:48.834
What's going on?

30:48.878 --> 30:50.106
Why are there cops here?

30:50.146 --> 30:52.239
The campus rapist
may be targeting Clare.

30:52.282 --> 30:53.306
Who do they think it is?

30:53.383 --> 30:54.850
Some guy who worked
at the Condor's Nest.

30:54.884 --> 30:56.317
Well, do they know his name?

30:56.386 --> 30:57.751
lt's probably an alias,

30:57.787 --> 31:00.312
but the name that he's
been using is Garret Slan.

31:00.356 --> 31:03.621
Wait a second,
l know that name.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.457
You know, l think
it's a friend of Donna's.

31:05.495 --> 31:06.985
Donna?

31:08.965 --> 31:11.126
l'll be right there, honeybun.

31:26.316 --> 31:30.753
Well, how do l look?

31:30.787 --> 31:34.086
You look ravishing.

31:34.123 --> 31:36.489
Are those ropes too tight?

31:44.734 --> 31:48.500
Just relax, just relax.

31:48.538 --> 31:51.302
You won't be needing
this anymore.

31:51.407 --> 31:53.307
Please don't hurt me.

31:53.409 --> 31:55.673
Take anything you want.

31:55.712 --> 31:57.077
You're what l want.

31:57.113 --> 32:00.310
Please...

32:00.383 --> 32:02.977
l've never done this before.

32:03.019 --> 32:04.247
What?

32:04.320 --> 32:06.379
A little tramp like you
is still a virgin?

32:06.422 --> 32:10.381
Please, please, let me go.
Please...

32:10.426 --> 32:11.893
This is going to
be more memorable

32:11.928 --> 32:13.759
than l could ever imagine.

32:14.797 --> 32:16.697
Donna, you home?

32:20.336 --> 32:22.827
Who is it?

32:22.872 --> 32:24.032
lt's my roommate.

32:24.073 --> 32:26.098
Don't lie to me.
No men live here.

32:26.142 --> 32:28.201
Come on, Donna, l saw your car
outside. l know you're here.

32:28.244 --> 32:31.509
Get rid of him.

32:31.547 --> 32:32.639
Go away, David.

32:32.682 --> 32:34.616
l don't want to talk to you.

32:34.651 --> 32:35.709
Donna, l know you don't.

32:35.752 --> 32:36.719
Especially after the way

32:36.753 --> 32:38.721
l spoke to you
this afternoon.

32:38.755 --> 32:40.689
l've just been under
a lot of pressure.

32:40.723 --> 32:42.520
Look, can we talk
about it tomorrow?

32:42.558 --> 32:43.650
l just can't stand you thinking

32:43.693 --> 32:45.024
l'm the only one
who got Ray fired.

32:45.061 --> 32:46.585
lt's just...
it's not true.

32:46.629 --> 32:48.722
Okay, Dave.

32:48.765 --> 32:50.665
We'll talk about it
tomorrow, l promise.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.964
All right.

32:53.002 --> 32:54.492
What's up with the lights?

32:56.005 --> 32:58.439
l just...

32:58.474 --> 33:00.806
l've got a migraine,
and you're making it worse.

33:01.778 --> 33:03.245
Sorry.

33:03.313 --> 33:05.713
Can l, uh, get you anything?

33:09.052 --> 33:10.246
No, Dave.

33:10.353 --> 33:12.913
Just go.

33:18.127 --> 33:21.460
All right, l'll, uh,
l'll see you tomorrow.

33:23.433 --> 33:27.631
Well, it's too bad
David spoiled the mood.

33:27.670 --> 33:30.070
Looks like we're going
to have to make it quick.

33:30.106 --> 33:32.734
Aw, it's your first time, too.

33:32.775 --> 33:34.140
No!

33:36.813 --> 33:38.940
No! No!

33:38.981 --> 33:42.917
No! No! No! No!

33:42.952 --> 33:45.147
No!

33:45.188 --> 33:46.485
lt's okay, it's okay,

33:46.522 --> 33:47.546
it's okay.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.989
l know he's out.

33:49.025 --> 33:51.050
lt's okay.

33:51.094 --> 33:54.530
Come on, it's okay.

33:54.564 --> 33:55.929
lt's okay.

33:58.468 --> 34:00.436
Have some tandoori, man.

34:00.470 --> 34:01.903
No, l gotta pass.

34:01.938 --> 34:03.735
l can't stand that curry.
l got white man's tongue.

34:03.773 --> 34:05.172
Hey, no curry on tandoori.

34:05.208 --> 34:07.472
When l was in lndia, that is
all that l could get down

34:07.510 --> 34:08.534
for the first couple months.

34:08.578 --> 34:09.875
When were you in lndia?

34:09.911 --> 34:12.540
'72, '73,
ah, somewhere around there.

34:12.581 --> 34:14.607
l was barely even born yet.

34:14.650 --> 34:17.483
Oh, well, you're just
a young pup, ain't ya?

34:17.520 --> 34:19.454
But you got an old soul, huh?

34:19.489 --> 34:21.514
You really think we've
all been here before?

34:21.556 --> 34:24.492
-Here? God, hope not.
-Yeah, l know what you mean.

34:24.527 --> 34:25.721
l'm having enough trouble
getting through

34:25.762 --> 34:27.592
-the here and now.
-Yeah, but you know what,

34:27.630 --> 34:30.155
l think there's really something
to the idea of Karma.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.393
-Karma?
-Yeah, man.

34:31.434 --> 34:33.664
lt's a series of lives
that you lead

34:33.703 --> 34:35.534
until you learn the lesson
that you've got to learn.

34:35.571 --> 34:37.471
And then what, you reach...?

34:37.507 --> 34:39.065
Nirvana.

34:39.108 --> 34:41.167
Oh, hey, hey.

34:42.712 --> 34:45.272
Well, good ol' number 103.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.007
l knew he'd be back.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.748
This is a pleasant surprise.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.089
l thought you were
busy tonight.

34:57.126 --> 34:59.094
Well, l canceled my plans.

34:59.128 --> 35:02.029
Mmm. Well, that was very
naughty of you. l love it.

35:02.064 --> 35:03.929
Peter, what's the rush, huh?

35:03.966 --> 35:06.935
l'm on a break,
that's the rush.

35:06.969 --> 35:08.436
Mmm....

35:08.471 --> 35:10.962
Peter, we have to talk.

35:11.007 --> 35:12.736
We can't continue this way.

35:12.775 --> 35:14.333
Well, l thought
we already talked.

35:14.377 --> 35:17.778
l'm not giving you up,
and you're not giving me up,

35:17.814 --> 35:19.975
unless something's changed.

35:20.016 --> 35:23.577
Well... something has changed.

35:23.619 --> 35:25.849
Oh.

35:25.888 --> 35:27.116
But it's good.

35:27.156 --> 35:30.057
l'm leaving Jesse.

35:30.092 --> 35:31.252
What?

35:31.360 --> 35:32.691
l've been living

35:32.728 --> 35:34.059
a lie all this time.

35:34.096 --> 35:35.563
l can't do it anymore.

35:35.598 --> 35:37.657
l'm married to one man,

35:37.700 --> 35:41.636
and l'm in love with another.

35:41.671 --> 35:43.229
lt's not fair to either of you,

35:43.272 --> 35:44.796
and it's definitely
not fair to me.

35:44.841 --> 35:46.934
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

35:46.976 --> 35:48.841
When did you decide this?

35:48.878 --> 35:50.470
Well, it's been growing.

35:50.513 --> 35:54.472
lt's obvious, it's... it's
been going on for a long time.

35:56.052 --> 35:58.850
Peter, l'm unhappy with Jesse,

35:58.888 --> 36:01.288
and you're unhappy
with Adrienne.

36:01.324 --> 36:05.055
There's no reason we should
be unhappy separately

36:05.094 --> 36:06.561
when we can be happy together.

36:06.596 --> 36:09.622
Andrea...

36:09.665 --> 36:12.225
l'm sorry,
but l'm not unhappy.

36:12.268 --> 36:13.565
ln fact, l'm delighted

36:13.603 --> 36:15.230
with the perfect arrangement
we've got here.

36:15.338 --> 36:17.238
No one gets hurt, and
there are no strings.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.830
lsn't that part of
what makes it fun?

36:18.875 --> 36:21.343
Fun?

36:21.377 --> 36:22.639
l thought you wanted strings.

36:22.678 --> 36:24.407
l thought you wanted
to be with me.

36:24.447 --> 36:25.914
Yeah, but Adrienne put me

36:25.948 --> 36:27.916
through med school,
and it'll be years before

36:27.950 --> 36:29.850
l'm making any real money
as a doctor.

36:29.886 --> 36:32.252
l couldn't leave her
if l wanted to.

36:32.288 --> 36:35.689
And... l don't want to.

36:37.693 --> 36:39.752
l see.

36:39.795 --> 36:40.887
Look, Andrea...

36:40.930 --> 36:42.192
Don't touch me.

36:44.667 --> 36:47.966
Hey, don't make me
the bad guy here, okay?

36:48.004 --> 36:49.631
l never promised
you anything.

36:49.672 --> 36:51.572
Oh, no, you promised a lot.

36:51.607 --> 36:54.735
Maybe not in words,
but you promised.

37:15.264 --> 37:17.198
Well, hey, that was quick.

37:17.233 --> 37:19.224
Talk about wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am. Ah.

37:23.239 --> 37:25.537
Be right back, Charley.

37:25.575 --> 37:26.633
Hey, Andrea.

37:26.676 --> 37:28.166
Andrea.

37:28.210 --> 37:29.199
Hey, hey, whoa.

37:29.245 --> 37:33.238
Hey... come here,
it's all right.

37:33.349 --> 37:34.907
Let it out, it's all right.

37:34.951 --> 37:37.545
lt's not all right.

37:37.587 --> 37:41.751
l was going to leave Jesse
to be with Peter.

37:41.791 --> 37:44.259
How could l be so stupid?

37:44.327 --> 37:46.795
How could l think that
something was so true

37:46.829 --> 37:48.490
when it was so false?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.231
Dylan, l don't even
know who l am.

37:57.273 --> 38:01.539
Nobody does really
babe, nobody does.

38:19.028 --> 38:20.825
So, how's our girl holding up?

38:20.863 --> 38:22.888
Pretty good,

38:22.932 --> 38:24.923
considering what
she's been through.

38:26.602 --> 38:28.729
So, l don't understand this.

38:28.771 --> 38:30.898
The cops said that you
told them about Garret.

38:30.940 --> 38:35.240
Yeah, in the conversations
l had with your friend, Lenny,

38:35.277 --> 38:37.108
it came out that
he had spent some time

38:37.146 --> 38:39.671
in the military prison
with Garret.

38:39.715 --> 38:41.080
So, why didn't he say
anything sooner?

38:41.117 --> 38:43.108
He got scared when he
didn't mention anything

38:43.152 --> 38:44.881
when he was first questioned.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.184
He thought if he
brought it up later on,

38:47.223 --> 38:48.690
he'd get hauled in
as an accomplice.

38:48.724 --> 38:49.782
That sounds like Lenny.

38:49.825 --> 38:51.156
He's usually pretty paranoid.

38:51.193 --> 38:53.127
Well, it turns out
Garret was picking

38:53.162 --> 38:55.460
his brain
about all the coeds at CU,

38:55.498 --> 38:57.693
so he may have had
good reason to worry.

38:57.733 --> 38:59.564
ls that why you thought
Garret was after me?

38:59.602 --> 39:02.400
Uh-huh, but then he met Donna
and one thing lead to another.

39:02.438 --> 39:04.201
l gotta tell you,

39:04.306 --> 39:06.206
l'm honestly pretty surprised
that Lenny talked to you at all.

39:06.308 --> 39:07.206
l think he was hoping

39:07.309 --> 39:08.936
l could talk to the university

39:08.978 --> 39:10.502
about helping him transfer

39:10.546 --> 39:12.537
to another college
in the CU system.

39:12.581 --> 39:13.605
Well, could you?

39:13.649 --> 39:14.980
Yeah, sure.

39:15.017 --> 39:17.349
The guy deserves a break.

39:17.386 --> 39:20.116
Great, thanks.

39:20.156 --> 39:22.124
l'll get this
back over to Donna.

39:27.363 --> 39:29.456
Here you go.

39:30.733 --> 39:32.428
Thanks, Dave.

39:32.468 --> 39:34.436
That was pretty smart.

39:34.470 --> 39:37.098
l knew something was wrong,
'cause you never call me Dave.

39:37.139 --> 39:39.607
l hope l never have to again.

39:43.846 --> 39:45.074
l'm sorry l broke the figurine

39:45.114 --> 39:46.775
you gave me last year
at the carnival.

39:46.816 --> 39:48.681
What, that stupid plaster thing?

39:48.718 --> 39:50.618
l'm surprised you even kept it.

39:50.653 --> 39:54.054
Of course l did.

39:54.090 --> 39:55.523
That was the last thing
you ever gave me.

39:57.593 --> 40:00.118
Thanks.

40:00.162 --> 40:01.652
You're welcome.
