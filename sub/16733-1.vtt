00:10.082 --> 00:13.051
<i>For decades,
millions of people have come here</i>

00:13.052 --> 00:14.986
<i>in search of the American Dream,</i>

00:14.987 --> 00:18.957
<i>but for many, that dream
is quickly disappearing.</i>

00:18.958 --> 00:22.361
<i>Are you unemployed
or stuck in a dead-end job?</i>

00:22.362 --> 00:26.465
<i>Thousands of people around
the state are losing their jobs every day.</i>

00:26.466 --> 00:29.134
<i>Are you homeless, or
living in a bad neighborhood?</i>

00:29.135 --> 00:34.039
<i>Unemployment shot up to
its highest level in nearly 26 years.</i>

00:34.040 --> 00:37.476
<i>If the "American
Dream" broke its promise to you,</i>

00:37.477 --> 00:39.777
<i>don't worry, we have an answer.</i>

00:43.982 --> 00:46.450
<i>Let me help you help yourself.</i>

00:47.753 --> 00:50.622
I'm gonna give you three and a half grams.
You know what to do with this?

00:50.623 --> 00:53.457
'Cause if you know what to do
with it, you gonna be all right.

00:57.462 --> 01:00.465
<i>Welcome to the game.
This is your guide book.</i>

01:00.466 --> 01:03.033
<i>Our experts are going to give
you everything you need.</i>

01:04.334 --> 01:06.349
<i>You can make a thousand
dollars in an hour.</i>

01:06.350 --> 01:08.773
It's very easy to make a lot of
money with cocaine.

01:08.774 --> 01:11.009
<i>You could have a six
figure starting salary...</i>

01:11.010 --> 01:14.613
It's hard for me to believe that something
that small could be worth so much money.

01:14.614 --> 01:17.081
<i>You can make a
million dollars in a week.</i>

01:17.683 --> 01:20.418
<i>In this program,
masters of the trade</i>

01:20.419 --> 01:22.619
<i>are going to reveal to you their secrets</i>

01:22.620 --> 01:27.157
<i>on how to get paid in this exciting
$400 billion global industry.</i>

01:27.926 --> 01:32.030
<i>For the next 90 minutes, we're going
to focus on marijuana and cocaine,</i>

01:32.031 --> 01:36.901
but the same lessons work for any illegal
substance Americans are willing to buy,

01:37.302 --> 01:39.402
<i>whether you want to
make a few extra bucks,</i>

01:39.403 --> 01:41.839
<i>or climb to the very top of the
food chain and make billions.</i>

01:42.141 --> 01:44.408
<i>This training guide
will show you how to do it.</i>

01:44.710 --> 01:47.511
You want to know how to
make money selling drugs?

02:01.927 --> 02:04.196
<i>Name's Bobby Carlton,</i>

02:04.197 --> 02:07.799
I've lived pretty much
in every ghetto town,

02:07.800 --> 02:11.536
and my mom had it rough raising us.
She had me very young.

02:11.537 --> 02:15.073
<i>A year after I was, uh,
born, my brother was born.</i>

02:15.074 --> 02:17.676
<i>Years later,
I'd have two sisters.</i>

02:17.677 --> 02:20.212
Stepfather, two sisters,
he'd eventually leave,

02:20.213 --> 02:22.147
<i>and then she'd be
stuck with four kids.</i>

02:22.148 --> 02:24.082
She'd basically just
try to raise a family

02:24.083 --> 02:27.786
and try to earn enough
to put food on the table.

02:27.787 --> 02:30.889
I look at people, they got to get
up, they got to be in an office,

02:30.890 --> 02:33.959
they got to go to a factory, they got
to bang their heads against a wall,

02:33.960 --> 02:35.894
<i>they're trying
to earn, earn, earn,</i>

02:35.895 --> 02:38.830
but really, what they're doing is
just barely making their payments.

02:38.831 --> 02:43.001
<i>They're working just to get by.</i>

02:43.002 --> 02:45.871
<i>I wanted to make
money to go live.</i>

02:45.872 --> 02:48.974
I was always looking up
to the bigger kids,

02:48.975 --> 02:51.843
who, people I perceived cool
and trying to emulate them.

02:51.844 --> 02:54.746
The guys hanging on the
street corner, not working,

02:54.747 --> 02:57.916
<i>they have girls, they have
cars, they have money,</i>

02:57.917 --> 03:02.554
they seemingly don't ever have to
be anywhere at any certain time.

03:02.555 --> 03:04.054
And I want in. I'm in.

03:06.591 --> 03:08.760
<i>What Bobby Carlton
was about to discover</i>

03:08.761 --> 03:10.481
<i>is that marijuana makes money.</i>

03:11.530 --> 03:14.299
<i>More money than tobacco,
cotton, even corn.</i>

03:14.300 --> 03:20.005
<i>It's the most profitable
farmed product in the country.</i>

03:20.006 --> 03:22.874
I smoked a joint, and then
you just get into it.

03:22.875 --> 03:24.275
And then other
people want to do it.

03:24.276 --> 03:26.376
I just broke it down, and I was like,

03:26.377 --> 03:29.147
<i>Seven joints were in a bag,
it's a dollar for a joint,</i>

03:29.849 --> 03:31.816
<i>you pay $5 for that bag.</i>

03:31.817 --> 03:34.152
Okay. I'll buy a bag,
break it down,

03:34.153 --> 03:36.221
sell five joints,
smoke two myself.

03:36.222 --> 03:38.657
It's kind of innocent, right?

03:38.658 --> 03:40.124
<i>Ninth grade...</i>

03:40.125 --> 03:44.225
<i>up to that point I was the
kind of student that didn't participate</i>

03:44.226 --> 03:46.664
<i>but then they were like, "How
many grams are in an ounce?"</i>

03:46.665 --> 03:47.965
<i>and I was like, "28".</i>

03:47.966 --> 03:50.302
<i>They were like, "How many pounds
are in a kilo?" I was like, "2.2."</i>

03:50.303 --> 03:52.837
"And do you want me to tell
you how much that costs?"

03:52.838 --> 03:55.438
Hence, everybody at school knew
what I was up to that day.

04:00.345 --> 04:04.048
<i>If Bobby Carlton
can do it, so can you.</i>

04:04.049 --> 04:05.949
<i>But how can you grow your business?</i>

04:05.950 --> 04:10.255
<i>How do you expand from a small circle
of friends and attract more clients?</i>

04:10.256 --> 04:14.593
Making money selling drugs is easy.

04:14.594 --> 04:17.963
<i>Meet Pepe, a retired
Southern California drug dealer,</i>

04:17.964 --> 04:21.666
<i>who's going to tell you how
simple it is to get customers.</i>

04:21.666 --> 04:27.372
Like I say, is not hard.
Everybody can do it.

04:27.373 --> 04:30.342
Well, you just walk out to
the street and the park

04:30.343 --> 04:35.146
and everybody is gonna say, "Hey! Spark
it up," and you'll start rolling.

04:35.147 --> 04:38.649
If you smoke outside, you make a
friend, because weed makes friends.

04:39.818 --> 04:41.285
Weed makes friends.

04:43.388 --> 04:45.690
<i>Now that you've
got some customers,</i>

04:45.691 --> 04:47.092
<i>you're gonna need some product.</i>

04:47.093 --> 04:48.259
<i>Where do you get it?</i>

04:48.260 --> 04:52.697
<i>Most people
know where to get it,</i>

04:52.698 --> 04:56.735
and if you don't know where to
get marijuana in bulk to sell,

04:56.736 --> 04:59.670
all you have to do is ask one or two
people, and someone's gonna know.

04:59.671 --> 05:00.971
I mean, it's all over the place.

05:00.972 --> 05:03.675
People will front you as
many drugs as you can sell.

05:03.676 --> 05:06.711
As long as you can continue to pay people
back, they will front them to you.

05:06.712 --> 05:09.752
<i>And if you want to skip the middle men?
Grow your own weed.</i>

05:11.950 --> 05:16.855
Pepe spent quite a few winters making a lot
of money without ever having to leave home.

05:16.856 --> 05:20.992
To grow some weed, uh, in your
house, you only need electricity,

05:20.993 --> 05:23.395
big lamps, and water.

05:23.396 --> 05:26.163
<i>You get in the internet,
you have the seeds, you know.</i>

05:27.232 --> 05:29.967
<i>This is just kind of
like a starter kit for people.</i>

05:31.136 --> 05:34.806
<i>You can get it at any hydroponics
store and get your whole set-up.</i>

05:34.807 --> 05:38.376
<i>They'll sell you the tubes, the
nutrients, the little planters.</i>

05:38.377 --> 05:41.713
<i>In about 45 days, these will
grow to about six feet tall,</i>

05:41.714 --> 05:43.814
be lush, green, and lovely.

05:43.815 --> 05:45.515
You cut it, you hang it.

05:45.516 --> 05:50.689
<i>Let it dry for a couple of days,
and then pick all the buds off.</i>

05:50.690 --> 05:53.024
<i>So how much money
can you expect to make?</i>

05:53.025 --> 05:55.160
Yeah, you can make
a lot of money.

05:55.161 --> 05:57.896
I mean, like, is gonna grow
a pound for each plant,

05:57.897 --> 06:00.732
and a pound in the streets

06:00.733 --> 06:04.169
goes $2,500, $3,000,
if it is a good weed.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.838
Per 10, how much you gonna have?

06:06.839 --> 06:08.372
$30,000.

06:09.374 --> 06:13.011
In three months, people,
they doing a whole house.

06:13.012 --> 06:15.879
If you put 50, 150 thousand.

06:20.052 --> 06:22.887
<i>For many dealers, the
risk of jail time is worth it.</i>

06:22.888 --> 06:25.190
You make $100,000 selling drugs.

06:25.191 --> 06:28.760
Hide the money, and go to jail, and
when you come out, you have money.

06:28.761 --> 06:32.063
If somebody gave me $100,000
to go to jail for five years,

06:32.064 --> 06:34.265
I would take it, you know.

06:34.266 --> 06:35.934
What the fuck. I mean, you...

06:35.935 --> 06:37.435
Sometimes, you work 10 years

06:37.436 --> 06:40.804
and you don't even see $20,000
in your bank account.

06:41.806 --> 06:45.076
<i>But the nearly one million
Americans arrested each year for marijuana</i>

06:45.077 --> 06:48.780
<i>are caught on possession charges,
and never even sold a joint.</i>

06:48.781 --> 06:52.016
<i>Given the risks, you'll want to
save your money as fast as you can</i>

06:52.017 --> 06:54.018
<i>and start trading
more expensive drugs.</i>

06:54.019 --> 06:56.386
I got into cocaine,
and I loved it.

06:58.289 --> 07:02.026
<i>When it comes to cocaine,
America is the land of opportunity.</i>

07:02.027 --> 07:05.463
<i>It's the number one consumer
of coke in the world.</i>

07:05.464 --> 07:07.499
<i>The largest study of bank notes</i>

07:07.500 --> 07:09.968
<i>has found that nearly
nine out of 10 bills</i>

07:09.969 --> 07:13.204
<i>circulating in the U.S.
are tainted with cocaine.</i>

07:13.205 --> 07:14.539
<i>It's a law of nature.</i>

07:14.540 --> 07:16.841
<i>Where there's demand,
there's supply.</i>

07:16.842 --> 07:18.543
<i>And that's where you come in.</i>

07:18.544 --> 07:20.545
<i>The life of a coke dealer
isn't easy.</i>

07:20.546 --> 07:23.548
<i>When you start out,
you're alone, unprotected,</i>

07:23.549 --> 07:27.285
<i>at the bottom of a ruthless,
international crime syndicate.</i>

07:27.286 --> 07:31.523
<i>Most of the world's cocaine is manufactured
by drug lords in South America.</i>

07:31.524 --> 07:35.126
<i>They smuggle over 500 tons into the U.S.
every year.</i>

07:35.127 --> 07:38.496
<i>Along the way, it passes through
a long line of distributors,</i>

07:38.497 --> 07:40.465
<i>until a couple
of grams get to you,</i>

07:40.466 --> 07:43.801
<i>a pawn in a massive,
70 billion dollar game.</i>

07:48.006 --> 07:52.309
Pawns, man, in the game,
they get capped quick.

07:53.278 --> 07:54.879
They be out the game early.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.080
Unless they some
smart ass pawns.

08:00.318 --> 08:04.589
<i>Curtis Jackson, otherwise
known as 50 Cent, had to learn quick.</i>

08:04.590 --> 08:08.193
My mom hustled to provide
for me, financially.

08:08.194 --> 08:13.064
And her friends were all the people that
were out selling drugs as a lifestyle.

08:13.065 --> 08:15.333
<i>Curtis was
raised without a father,</i>

08:15.334 --> 08:18.203
<i>and his mother was murdered
when he was eight years old.</i>

08:18.204 --> 08:20.205
My mom was all I had,

08:20.206 --> 08:25.944
so when I lost her, I lost everything
that was pretty much good in my life.

08:25.945 --> 08:28.379
<i>Her old friends
bought me things,</i>

08:28.380 --> 08:30.514
<i>then they got tired
of just buying me things.</i>

08:31.983 --> 08:34.116
They gave me an eight
ball of cocaine.

08:35.119 --> 08:37.589
And they told me,
if anybody bothers you,

08:37.590 --> 08:40.058
you know, you tell them
you got it from us,

08:40.058 --> 08:43.628
and you'll be all right
in the neighborhood.

08:43.629 --> 08:46.930
I was about 12 years old
when that happened to me.

08:50.134 --> 08:52.470
<i>That's the incredible
thing about cocaine.</i>

08:52.471 --> 08:56.207
<i>You can use it to make ends meet
when there are no other options.</i>

08:56.208 --> 08:59.244
<i>You can be anybody, even a kid.</i>

08:59.245 --> 09:03.348
I would say about 14 or 15. That's when I
pretty much started into the drug trade.

09:03.349 --> 09:07.986
<i>Let's say you're down and out,
like John was, living in South Central L.A.,</i>

09:07.987 --> 09:09.621
<i>crashing at your family's place,</i>

09:09.622 --> 09:12.023
<i>with no money,
not even for food.</i>

09:12.024 --> 09:14.225
<i>We were living in the
back of my uncle's house.</i>

09:14.226 --> 09:16.426
<i>He had this lemon tree, and one
day he came out and he was like,</i>

09:16.427 --> 09:19.027
It seems like the lemons ain't growing any shit.

09:19.028 --> 09:20.999
We didn't have no food. You know, me and
my mom was eating lemons for dinner.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.033
So, after that,
I had to get paid.

09:24.569 --> 09:27.538
<i>The money that you could make
on the corner was real good.</i>

09:27.539 --> 09:31.643
I started off with small amounts,
then I got to the big amounts.

09:31.644 --> 09:35.647
<i>Crack, the most popular form
of cocaine sold in the open market.</i>

09:35.648 --> 09:38.983
<i>It's cheaper than powder, so low
income users can afford it.</i>

09:38.984 --> 09:40.585
<i>When you work
for an organization,</i>

09:40.586 --> 09:43.421
<i>they'll supply you with
$10 crack cocaine rocks.</i>

09:43.422 --> 09:45.523
<i>Because most of your
customers are addicts,</i>

09:45.524 --> 09:48.626
<i>they'll be impatient to make a
buy right out on the street.</i>

09:48.627 --> 09:52.096
<i>And the good thing about crack
fiends is they'll keep coming back.</i>

09:52.097 --> 09:55.265
Some guys will make anywhere
from $1,000 to $10,000 a day.

10:01.372 --> 10:03.674
<i>Are you the man
with them jumbo 6s?</i>

10:03.675 --> 10:05.175
How many you fucking want?

10:05.176 --> 10:07.210
I'll take about three
or four hundred.

10:07.211 --> 10:08.412
Damn.

10:14.037 --> 10:16.052
It's all in the game yo.

10:16.053 --> 10:19.557
<i>It's harder than functioning
in mainstream or corporate America</i>

10:19.558 --> 10:22.060
<i>because the dynamics
of it is different.</i>

10:22.061 --> 10:26.564
In order to take a position in that
world, you can just, "pow." Just shoot.

10:26.565 --> 10:28.665
<i>The chances of getting
robbed are pretty great, you know?</i>

10:28.667 --> 10:31.436
You do as much as you
can to minimize that,

10:31.437 --> 10:33.604
but somebody at some point
is gonna want what you have,

10:33.605 --> 10:35.405
and they're not gonna have
the money to pay for it.

10:35.407 --> 10:37.307
They are gonna try
and take it from you.

10:37.308 --> 10:38.808
<i>Eric Sterling is an attorney.</i>

10:38.809 --> 10:42.312
<i>With 30 years' experience investigating
the criminal drug world.</i>

10:42.313 --> 10:43.613
<i>He can explain more.</i>

10:43.614 --> 10:48.219
If I steal a television set out
of, uh, you know, Best Buy,

10:48.220 --> 10:52.557
it lists for $1,000, I'll sell
it for $200 on the street.

10:52.558 --> 10:57.328
If I go rob the dope dealer,
I get all his cash,

10:57.329 --> 10:58.596
and I get drugs.

10:58.597 --> 11:00.665
And the advantage
of stolen drugs is

11:00.666 --> 11:03.568
when I steal a guy's coke
that's worth $1,000,

11:03.569 --> 11:05.737
I get to sell it for $1,000!

11:05.738 --> 11:07.772
There's no discount
for hot dope.

11:07.773 --> 11:09.240
Ever happened to you?

11:09.241 --> 11:11.075
Mmm.

11:11.076 --> 11:13.077
Not me. No, I never had
no problems like that.

11:13.078 --> 11:15.779
'Cause at the end of the day, you fuck
me, you gonna know what's happening.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.680
That right there, separates men from the boys.

11:17.681 --> 11:20.351
Are you gonna give them your drugs or
are you gonna tell them to fuck off?

11:20.352 --> 11:22.587
And I'm the person
that's gonna say fuck off.

11:22.588 --> 11:25.757
If you don't have a pistol, I don't
know why you even selling dope.

11:25.758 --> 11:28.626
You won't last. 'Cause
somebody gonna try you.

11:28.627 --> 11:31.729
<i>Anyone who is dealing
drugs in this community,</i>

11:31.730 --> 11:35.500
<i>if they do not have a gun on
them, believe me, it's close by.</i>

11:35.501 --> 11:39.604
<i>It's under a stoop, right around a
corner, tucked behind a phone booth,</i>

11:39.605 --> 11:40.772
but it's close by.

11:40.773 --> 11:44.609
They look up in your face,
they look up in your eye,

11:44.610 --> 11:46.644
they see the gun and they
know who's gonna use it,

11:46.645 --> 11:47.744
who ain't gonna use it.

11:49.747 --> 11:52.616
A, assess. "Don't shoot
them, kill them."

11:53.785 --> 11:56.320
Because if you shoot them, you gonna
make them angry enough to come back

11:56.321 --> 11:57.488
and really hurt you.

11:57.489 --> 11:59.656
So, if you're gonna shoot,
shoot to kill.

11:59.657 --> 12:01.557
I remember when I first got to L.A.

12:01.558 --> 12:04.429
It was like motherfuckers were shooting
each other every day on the news.

12:04.430 --> 12:07.799
It was like, New York, very much
like a stabbing society, you know.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.568
Something goes wrong, somebody
sticks a knife in your chest.

12:10.569 --> 12:13.271
It was a drug deal gone bad,
I got the worst of it.

12:13.272 --> 12:16.140
Stabbed here, stabbed
here, stabbed here.

12:16.141 --> 12:20.411
Once in the back of the head, once in
the chest, entered the left ventricle,

12:20.412 --> 12:23.213
and this is from
the open heart surgery.

12:25.349 --> 12:30.588
<i>I don't want to say it's a miracle, but
the doctor brought me back to life.</i>

12:30.589 --> 12:33.558
<i>If you really want to
lower your risk of getting hurt,</i>

12:33.559 --> 12:37.295
<i>stabbed or shot, packing a
gun can only get you so far.</i>

12:37.296 --> 12:39.363
<i>Hiring backup is a great idea.</i>

12:39.364 --> 12:40.698
Who do I hire?

12:40.699 --> 12:43.668
Do I hire nobody...
Nobody's heard of?

12:43.669 --> 12:46.170
Or do I hire a guy who's
got the biggest reputation

12:46.171 --> 12:48.439
for being the craziest
motherfucker?

12:48.440 --> 12:53.578
The illegal drug market hires people
with reputations for violence.

12:53.579 --> 12:56.247
<i>But don't think just because
you have a gun and a few guys,</i>

12:56.248 --> 12:59.183
<i>you can just go out and
start acquiring territory.</i>

12:59.184 --> 13:04.255
Officer Neill Franklin served 33 years on the
Maryland State and Baltimore police forces.

13:04.256 --> 13:07.725
<i>Having overseen 17 drug task
forces, he can tell you,</i>

13:07.726 --> 13:09.627
<i>if you want to be
a corner hustler,</i>

13:09.628 --> 13:11.596
<i>you're gonna need
permission first.</i>

13:11.597 --> 13:15.233
<i>As you try to
acquire your market place,</i>

13:15.234 --> 13:18.302
<i>there's probably gonna
be someone already there.</i>

13:18.303 --> 13:22.306
<i>They're not going to share or give
up their territory that easily.</i>

13:22.307 --> 13:25.576
They're not going to share
it or give it up. Period.

13:25.577 --> 13:29.078
They would definitely approach you,
you will definitely get hurt

13:29.079 --> 13:33.484
trying to sell it in an area
without someone's consent.

13:33.485 --> 13:36.754
So I registered with the neighborhood
thugs, and that's how I got on.

13:36.755 --> 13:38.856
Basically, you got to
protect your neighborhood,

13:38.857 --> 13:42.859
and do the things that the organization require
you to do when you're a member of it.

13:42.860 --> 13:45.160
<i>I remember having
a homicide one day,</i>

13:45.170 --> 13:46.490
and they sat this
inmate before me.

13:46.497 --> 13:48.097
I said, "this guy looks familiar".

13:48.098 --> 13:51.736
<i>Two seconds into the conversation, I
realize I used to play with this kid</i>

13:51.737 --> 13:52.904
<i>and knew his brothers.</i>

13:52.905 --> 13:56.807
I said, "what are you doing here? How'd you get in
here?" He said, "Well, I'm in here for homicide."

13:56.808 --> 14:00.678
I said, "what are you talking about?" He says,
"Well, I was in the game. I was in the game."

14:00.679 --> 14:03.648
"And in an alley
behind Callow Street,"

14:03.649 --> 14:06.417
"I had to do what I had to do, and
I ended up taking someone's life"

14:06.418 --> 14:10.855
"defending myself because I
had to defend my territory"

14:10.856 --> 14:13.224
"and my business."

14:13.225 --> 14:16.460
<i>So now you know what it takes to
make it on the street in the open market.</i>

14:16.461 --> 14:19.797
But prices for drugs nowadays are way
cheaper than when Big John was selling,

14:19.798 --> 14:21.666
<i>and the risks are just as high.</i>

14:21.667 --> 14:23.668
<i>If you don't wind up
getting killed by rivals,</i>

14:23.669 --> 14:25.268
<i>or hooked on your own product,</i>

14:25.269 --> 14:27.069
<i>Cops are going to pick you up eventually.</i>

14:27.170 --> 14:30.707
<i>In today's drug market, you're risking
your life for less than minimum wage.</i>

14:30.708 --> 14:31.708
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

14:31.709 --> 14:34.944
If you want to go for the real money,
you got to get off the corner.

14:45.756 --> 14:48.659
<i>Detroit. City of opportunity.</i>

14:48.660 --> 14:52.296
<i>Once upon a time, the symbol
of America's might and power.</i>

14:52.297 --> 14:54.599
<i>The heart of our
manufacturing industry.</i>

14:54.600 --> 14:56.900
<i>The home of the American Dream.</i>

15:01.280 --> 15:03.405
<i>This is the Detroit of today.</i>

15:03.406 --> 15:05.943
<i>One of the highest unemployment
rates in the nation.</i>

15:05.944 --> 15:10.281
<i>Twenty-five percent of the population
has left in the last 10 years.</i>

15:10.282 --> 15:15.419
<i>For those without a job or who
can't move, they need to hustle.</i>

15:15.420 --> 15:19.389
<i>Mr. X wants to get out of the downward
spiral that's hit Detroit today.</i>

15:20.358 --> 15:22.259
<i>And he's going to tell you
what that means.</i>

15:22.260 --> 15:24.560
<i>It means I need to keep selling drugs</i>

15:24.561 --> 15:27.331
<i>or coke, or whatever the fuck
they're selling that's illegal.</i>

15:27.332 --> 15:29.333
<i>Because that's the only way out.</i>

15:29.334 --> 15:32.636
<i>I have a lot of bills.
I got rent to pay.</i>

15:32.637 --> 15:33.937
<i>Still gotta eat.</i>

15:33.938 --> 15:36.507
<i>But don't nobody really care
about your problems, man.</i>

15:36.508 --> 15:39.809
<i>You got to have the money, so,
welcome to the cocaine game.</i>

15:41.679 --> 15:43.948
<i>I rarely show
my face on the scene.</i>

15:43.949 --> 15:46.017
<i>Oh, man, I play
the phone game, man.</i>

15:46.018 --> 15:48.585
<i>Switch up my phones.
Keeps me off the corner.</i>

15:58.029 --> 16:00.630
<i>Uh, what is it that you want?</i>

16:05.369 --> 16:07.305
<i>Yeah I can get you a T for 70.</i>

16:07.306 --> 16:09.640
Okay, cool. I'll see
you in 30 minutes. Bye.

16:09.641 --> 16:10.775
<i>Bye.</i>

16:10.776 --> 16:12.910
<i>And bam.</i>

16:12.911 --> 16:14.411
<i>That's how you win.</i>

16:16.314 --> 16:18.449
<i>Shit, I'll be damned
if somebody tell me,</i>

16:18.450 --> 16:22.753
<i>"You got us working eight hours
for fucking $60, $70, man."</i>

16:22.754 --> 16:24.922
<i>That's crazy.
That's too much work.</i>

16:24.923 --> 16:26.724
<i>I just made that shit
in a phone call.</i>

16:26.725 --> 16:28.926
<i>The American Dream is
just to have enough money</i>

16:28.927 --> 16:31.962
<i>to be able to do whatever you want
to do, whenever you want to do it,</i>

16:31.963 --> 16:34.565
<i>based on your own hard work.</i>

16:34.566 --> 16:36.801
<i>Shit, just what I have on the
counter would probably get me</i>

16:36.802 --> 16:39.536
<i>anywhere from 10 years
to about 15 years.</i>

16:39.537 --> 16:41.537
<i>But if you ask me, it's worth it.</i>

16:41.538 --> 16:44.808
<i>I'd rather be out here getting
it than not getting it at all,</i>

16:44.809 --> 16:46.309
<i>I still wouldn't be out here.</i>

16:46.310 --> 16:49.814
<i>I've been really trying to free
myself, use the coke to free myself.</i>

16:49.815 --> 16:53.584
<i>As a private cocaine dealer,
you'll be mostly selling Ts and eight balls,</i>

16:53.585 --> 16:57.955
<i>sixteenth or eighth of an ounce little
baggies for up to 150 bucks a pop.</i>

16:57.956 --> 17:00.424
<i>Ramping up to 20
customers a day is easy.</i>

17:00.425 --> 17:03.694
<i>You'll be paying $500 for
your day's worth of cocaine,</i>

17:03.695 --> 17:06.097
<i>and you'll cut it in
half with baby laxative,</i>

17:06.098 --> 17:10.433
<i>which brings your profit to a total of a
grand a day, and you just got started.</i>

17:11.202 --> 17:13.560
<i>Don't bring fiends from outside
into your home.</i>

17:13.561 --> 17:18.338
You invite fiends into your house. They will be
waking you up while you're asleep, banging on the door.

17:18.339 --> 17:21.078
<i>They might bring the police with them,
with the wire taps and everything.</i>

17:21.079 --> 17:26.717
<i>That's how they do it. Man, they try to get as close
to you as possible, and you keep them at a distance.</i>

17:26.718 --> 17:28.953
<i>But you got to keep
that friendship with them.</i>

17:28.954 --> 17:31.889
<i>You can't be like, aggressive
with your customers.</i>

17:31.890 --> 17:36.694
<i>Cause you'll lose. You got to treat them fair,
you got to treat them like regular people.</i>

17:36.695 --> 17:40.730
<i>Man, a stash spot
is stashed away, hidden.</i>

17:40.731 --> 17:42.831
<i>If you say your house is not hidden.</i>

17:42.832 --> 17:44.702
<i>Get that shit out the house,
keep it out the house.</i>

17:44.703 --> 17:46.870
<i>Don't let nobody come
to the house to buy it.</i>

17:46.871 --> 17:48.771
<i>I wouldn't put my money in a bank.</i>

17:48.772 --> 17:51.841
<i>I wouldn't put my money anywhere
that someone else can control it.</i>

17:51.842 --> 17:53.842
<i>Shit, you gotta hide that too.</i>

17:53.843 --> 17:57.147
<i>It'd be best to hide that
wherever you put your dope at.</i>

17:57.148 --> 17:59.884
<i>You get about 500,000
or something like that.</i>

17:59.885 --> 18:03.621
<i>Start me a couple businesses, man,
get right up out of this shit.</i>

18:03.622 --> 18:06.891
<i>If you decide that you ever
want to pick up this game,</i>

18:06.892 --> 18:10.494
<i>shit, pick it up for the right
reason, the money only.</i>

18:10.495 --> 18:13.697
<i>Save from the time that you get it
to the time that you quit, man.</i>

18:13.698 --> 18:15.766
<i>And you won't be in it so long.</i>

18:15.767 --> 18:17.901
<i>If you choose
to be a cocaine dealer,</i>

18:17.902 --> 18:19.902
<i>You need to know the rest.</i>

18:19.903 --> 18:24.007
<i>If you're black, you're about four times as
likely to be arrested than a white dealer,</i>

18:24.008 --> 18:25.708
<i>Which is counter-intuitive.</i>

18:25.709 --> 18:29.547
<i>Because white Americans buy and
sell more cocaine than anyone else.</i>

18:29.548 --> 18:32.882
It's the circumstances to where they're
actually setting up to sell the drugs,

18:32.883 --> 18:33.883
the locations.

18:33.884 --> 18:36.520
See, the black drug dealers
will be in the neighborhoods

18:36.521 --> 18:40.191
where the law enforcement will search
people without very much reasoning.

18:40.192 --> 18:42.658
I mean, my first case,
it was like a fluke.

18:42.659 --> 18:43.859
A guy was running.

18:43.860 --> 18:47.498
He, uh, ran where we're at. I
happened to be just standing outside,

18:47.499 --> 18:49.467
and the police say,
"Get up against the fence."

18:49.468 --> 18:52.536
And I'm like, "Man, come on, why I
got to get up against the fence?"

18:52.537 --> 18:53.604
"Shut up."

18:53.605 --> 18:55.706
Next thing you know,

18:55.707 --> 18:57.875
they pulled this big brick out my pocket.

18:57.876 --> 18:59.944
So, that was the beginning
of the end, right there.

18:59.945 --> 19:02.112
<i>You're not only
more likely to be arrested,</i>

19:02.113 --> 19:04.582
<i>but prosecuted,
with heavy prison time.</i>

19:04.583 --> 19:09.119
The reason that 94.5%
of people incarcerated

19:09.120 --> 19:11.555
under the Rockefeller Drug
Laws are black and brown

19:11.556 --> 19:13.257
is that's the way
the DA's operate.

19:13.258 --> 19:15.993
<i>Business mogul
Russell Simmons spent years</i>

19:15.994 --> 19:19.630
<i>lobbying against the harsh Rockefeller
Drug Laws of New York City,</i>

19:19.631 --> 19:23.267
which treated the non-violent crime
of drug dealing the same as murder.

19:23.268 --> 19:25.503
I mean, imagine you're a model.

19:25.504 --> 19:27.738
You know, a fashion model. You
know, like some blonde girl.

19:27.739 --> 19:29.874
It doesn't matter where you're
from, you're not going to jail.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.242
And if you're some guy
from the hood,

19:31.243 --> 19:33.244
maybe you'll go
to jail for 20 years.

19:33.245 --> 19:35.913
Hell, they tried
to give me 45 years.

19:35.914 --> 19:40.050
So, I did a lot of time. I did, like
five years, spring something like that.

19:40.051 --> 19:44.622
And a white drug dealer will be in middle
America, somewhere in the suburbs.

19:44.623 --> 19:50.261
That isn't in a space where he can just be
searched for no reason at all or go to jail.

19:50.262 --> 19:53.697
<i>Curtis Jackson, Russell
Simmons, and many others</i>

19:53.698 --> 19:55.633
<i>have successfully
persuaded New York</i>

19:55.634 --> 19:58.869
<i>to reduce some of their
harsh sentencing practices.</i>

19:58.870 --> 20:01.572
<i>But 90% of those
convicted on drug charges</i>

20:01.573 --> 20:04.875
<i>are still African-American
and Latino.</i>

20:04.876 --> 20:06.777
<i>Like they say for any business,</i>

20:06.778 --> 20:10.647
<i>the golden rule, location,
location, location.</i>

20:12.283 --> 20:14.618
<i>I didn't care about people knew where I lived.</i>

20:14.619 --> 20:17.087
People would just come to my
house, and I would go outside

20:17.088 --> 20:19.990
and just give them the gram, and we
would do the transaction that way.

20:19.991 --> 20:24.761
In 2003, I was the main coke dealer
for all the private schools in L.A.

20:24.762 --> 20:26.462
<i>Meet Mike Walzman.</i>

20:26.463 --> 20:29.567
<i>If you're gonna be a private coke
dealer, this is the way to go.</i>

20:29.568 --> 20:31.135
<i>In a nice, suburban
neighborhood,</i>

20:31.136 --> 20:34.137
<i>selling to the largest
cocaine market directly.</i>

20:34.138 --> 20:35.938
Mike was a big party-er.

20:35.939 --> 20:38.842
<i>And already knew where to buy
cocaine for him and his friends.</i>

20:38.843 --> 20:42.146
<i>So, he was in a perfect position
to go into business for himself.</i>

20:42.147 --> 20:44.348
<i>What's going on
through my head is,</i>

20:44.349 --> 20:47.117
<i>just start selling drugs
to support my habit</i>

20:47.118 --> 20:50.054
<i>and to support the
lifestyle that I wanted.</i>

20:50.055 --> 20:53.190
People want drugs,
so I can sell drugs.

20:53.191 --> 20:55.092
'Cause I know where
to get it already.

20:55.093 --> 20:57.328
My first rock
was about this big,

20:57.329 --> 20:59.930
and I remember
showing my friends this.

20:59.931 --> 21:05.035
They were like, "No fucking way you have
this big of a rock with you right now",

21:05.036 --> 21:06.669
"like, this is insane."

21:08.947 --> 21:10.772
And it wasn't like, "stop doing this."

21:10.773 --> 21:15.042
<i>It was like, "This is
awesome, this is exciting."</i>

21:15.746 --> 21:19.950
The stories that grew out of me being
a coke dealer just went from this

21:19.951 --> 21:23.954
to like, you know, this, and I was
suddenly, you know, the guy...

21:23.955 --> 21:25.923
You know, that everyone's
talking about,

21:25.924 --> 21:29.093
<i>I threw a party at
the L'Ermitage hotel,</i>

21:29.094 --> 21:31.295
and I got, like,
the Penthouse suite.

21:31.296 --> 21:33.964
<i>I've always wanted
to be loved and accepted.</i>

21:33.965 --> 21:37.301
And that's what selling coke gave me.
It gave me that power,

21:37.302 --> 21:39.770
it gave me the feeling
of acceptance.

21:39.771 --> 21:42.640
It was definitely addictive
to be a drug dealer.

21:42.641 --> 21:45.876
Not only the money
that you got from it,

21:45.877 --> 21:48.112
<i>but the way people
talked about you,</i>

21:48.113 --> 21:52.249
the way people looked at you,
the power that I felt from it.

21:52.250 --> 21:56.987
I just liked having money. It gave
me security, it made me feel good.

21:56.988 --> 21:59.723
People don't know what's a
gram, and what's not a gram,

21:59.724 --> 22:01.392
they've never seen
coke before in their life.

22:01.393 --> 22:04.328
<i>The market rate for a gram
was about $50 for coke,</i>

22:04.329 --> 22:06.397
but if you're a rich girl
who didn't know anything,

22:06.398 --> 22:11.402
I would probably sell you
.5 for about $60 to $75.

22:11.403 --> 22:14.738
<i>A guy like Mike makes
half as much as our Detroit dealer,</i>

22:14.739 --> 22:18.042
<i>working half as hard, but with
virtually none of the risk.</i>

22:18.043 --> 22:21.278
The word got out that I have
coke, and I'm selling coke.

22:21.279 --> 22:24.381
The dean in the school,
they pulled me in,

22:24.382 --> 22:28.018
and they said, "Hey look, you know, we're
hearing that you're selling drugs",

22:28.019 --> 22:30.354
"and we want to do
a drug test on you."

22:30.355 --> 22:32.723
So, at that point, you
know, I thought to myself,

22:32.724 --> 22:36.927
"Well, I better really slow down
on this and not do it any more."

22:36.928 --> 22:38.328
<i>Mike failed his drug test,</i>

22:38.329 --> 22:41.364
and was kicked out of school,
but never did any hard time.

22:42.366 --> 22:44.902
<i>When dealing small amounts,
the nicer the neighborhood,</i>

22:44.903 --> 22:46.969
<i>the less chance
of getting busted.</i>

22:46.970 --> 22:48.670
<i>But selling only grams and ounces,</i>

22:48.671 --> 22:52.242
<i>it'll still take years to get that
mansion in the hills you want.</i>

22:52.243 --> 22:55.179
<i>To be a big time player,
you need to get committed.</i>

22:55.180 --> 22:57.313
<i>It's time to start
building a business.</i>

23:06.023 --> 23:08.859
Instead of selling ounces,
I started selling keys.

23:08.860 --> 23:12.029
<i>A key is a kilo of cocaine.</i>

23:12.030 --> 23:15.099
<i>A single kilo can run
you about $20,000.</i>

23:15.100 --> 23:17.334
I had what I believe was skills.

23:17.335 --> 23:21.171
<i>This is Skipp. He did
really well as a corner hustler.</i>

23:21.172 --> 23:25.342
I had the skills to sit on the
wall and make about $8,000 a day.

23:25.343 --> 23:28.512
<i>Once you've stacked up enough
money, you can buy larger quantities</i>

23:28.513 --> 23:32.349
<i>and supply dealers yourself, which is
what Skipp's gonna teach you to do.</i>

23:32.350 --> 23:36.420
<i>I was 10 or 11 years old,
my family life was dysfunctional.</i>

23:36.421 --> 23:39.223
My mother worked two jobs,
my father wasn't in the home,

23:39.224 --> 23:41.091
<i>so before drugs came
into the community,</i>

23:41.092 --> 23:45.496
lot of people who would hustle would
rob banks or rob jewellery stores.

23:45.497 --> 23:47.797
<i>The aggression, the
violence wasn't for me.</i>

23:47.800 --> 23:51.200
<i>Skipp was struggling to make ends meet,
when he joined the blood gang</i>

23:51.201 --> 23:54.501
<i>in order to protect himself from the
Crips bullying his neighborhood.</i>

23:54.506 --> 23:58.242
<i>I was a blood gang member, but it was
the relationships I had with the Crips</i>

23:58.243 --> 24:01.011
<i>that actually
introduced me to drugs.</i>

24:01.012 --> 24:04.012
<i>I saw them having money, and I was
asking them what are they doing,</i>

24:04.015 --> 24:07.315
and the more I hung out with them, I
got more into the culture of drugs.

24:07.385 --> 24:09.453
<i>We used to go to, uh,
different areas</i>

24:09.454 --> 24:12.022
<i>that weren't populated
by the L.A. culture</i>

24:12.023 --> 24:14.391
<i>so they wanted it, but they
didn't have the connection,</i>

24:14.392 --> 24:16.994
<i>so we would come out
and be that connection.</i>

24:16.995 --> 24:20.430
You'd have to have, uh, a
family contact or a friend.

24:20.431 --> 24:22.266
<i>I myself went to Las Vegas.</i>

24:22.267 --> 24:25.068
There are more than a hundred
street gangs in Los Angeles.

24:25.069 --> 24:27.371
Police now say they have
become heavily involved

24:27.372 --> 24:30.874
in the drug trade, exporting their
crimes throughout the west.

24:30.875 --> 24:33.877
Going out of town when people
knew you were from L.A.,

24:33.878 --> 24:36.180
that number one,
made you a star celebrity.

24:36.181 --> 24:39.583
And then, if you were the
guy who had the drugs,

24:39.584 --> 24:42.119
it made you an even
bigger celebrity.

24:42.120 --> 24:46.223
Made all the girls love
and want to come to you.

24:46.224 --> 24:49.064
The difficult part became
how to get it out of town.

24:51.161 --> 24:54.164
<i>I myself would always
buy a bucket.</i>

24:54.165 --> 24:58.869
Put whatever I want inside of it
and go get a girl who likes me.

24:58.870 --> 25:01.305
Don't tell her what's in the
car, and let her drive it.

25:01.306 --> 25:03.140
Did the girls
ever get pulled over?

25:03.141 --> 25:06.376
Nah, I've been fortunate that
that has never occurred.

25:06.377 --> 25:10.013
Um, however, they did get pregnant,
and I now have children.

25:10.014 --> 25:12.149
The relationships that
I wanted for a weekend

25:12.150 --> 25:14.618
have lasted longer
than I expected.

25:14.619 --> 25:17.187
<i>A lot of smugglers
get someone else to drive.</i>

25:17.188 --> 25:19.323
<i>But how do you keep
track of you driver?</i>

25:19.324 --> 25:22.325
The DEA make a living
chasing drugs across country.

25:24.628 --> 25:28.598
<i>So they can tell you how the smartest
suppliers keep track of their cargo.</i>

25:28.599 --> 25:30.799
This particular vehicle, the owner of the vehicle,

25:30.800 --> 25:35.472
<i>the source of supply had rigged
this car with a GPS locator</i>

25:35.473 --> 25:38.941
<i>and a phone, so he could
actually dial into the phone</i>

25:38.942 --> 25:40.942
<i>without the driver of the vehicle knowing</i>

25:40.943 --> 25:43.480
and he could monitor if the transaction
was going correctly or not.

25:43.481 --> 25:45.616
He would know if the vehicle
was out of position.

25:45.617 --> 25:48.085
<i>Now, you don't want
to put your drugs in the trunk.</i>

25:48.086 --> 25:50.554
<i>You're going to want some new
options on your vehicle.</i>

25:50.555 --> 25:54.323
<i>Designing "traps" is standard
practice for any local chop shop.</i>

25:57.127 --> 25:58.629
It's kind of like
a combination safe.

25:58.630 --> 26:01.130
It has to be a series of things
activated in the vehicle

26:01.131 --> 26:02.831
before the trap could work.

26:02.832 --> 26:06.036
<i>Like, they may have to have the air
conditioning on, the blinker on,</i>

26:06.037 --> 26:09.339
and a couple of other things within
the vehicle for it to activate.

26:09.340 --> 26:11.108
You got money to spend,
you'll get a real good trap.

26:11.109 --> 26:13.410
We've seen some sloppy
ones, this is good work.

26:13.411 --> 26:16.078
When they're closed, you would never
know by looking at it with your eye

26:16.079 --> 26:17.779
that there was a trap inside here

26:17.780 --> 26:20.117
so whoever constructed this
one was a professional.

26:20.118 --> 26:22.653
It goes the whole length
of the back seat area.

26:22.654 --> 26:25.589
So you could fit probably
in excess of 10 kilograms

26:25.590 --> 26:29.026
of, uh, narcotics, large amounts
of currency or weapons.

26:29.027 --> 26:32.029
<i>Now you're ready.
But before you hit the road,</i>

26:32.030 --> 26:35.164
<i>Pepe has some tips from back in the
day when he was running cocaine.</i>

26:49.113 --> 26:51.715
25? 25. No more.

26:51.716 --> 26:53.716
75? 75. You know?

26:59.057 --> 27:02.326
And you get there. You be there.

27:02.327 --> 27:04.661
<i>So how much does
a smuggler expect to make?</i>

27:04.662 --> 27:09.566
If they take 10 kilos, they give
me $4,000 just to smuggle it,

27:09.567 --> 27:14.236
or if it was more?
5,000. It all depends.

27:15.472 --> 27:18.308
<i>So you've driven a
few kilos across country,</i>

27:18.309 --> 27:21.711
<i>you might be making
mid six figures a year.</i>

27:21.712 --> 27:23.812
<i>There's no turning back now.</i>

27:23.813 --> 27:27.084
<i>Once you're in the game, you realize
just how many people want drugs.</i>

27:27.085 --> 27:31.288
There's everybody from the Wall Street
types to the people on the streets,

27:31.289 --> 27:34.725
to kids going
to concerts, the stoners.

27:34.726 --> 27:36.560
Everybody wanted cocaine.

27:36.561 --> 27:39.062
<i>What domestic
smugglers make in a month,</i>

27:39.063 --> 27:41.530
<i>Bobby Carlton would
eventually make in a day.</i>

27:47.471 --> 27:50.773
<i>In the 70s, all the cocaine was
coming in through South Florida,</i>

27:50.774 --> 27:52.874
<i>So that's where Bobby went.</i>

27:52.875 --> 27:54.574
Ended up down in Fort Lauderdale

27:54.575 --> 27:57.214
<i>and uh, back then they used to
call it the South Florida shuffle.</i>

27:57.215 --> 28:01.184
<i>Everybody and anybody was selling
drugs, running drugs, moving drugs.</i>

28:01.185 --> 28:05.322
<i>They were coming in, and
they were going everywhere.</i>

28:05.323 --> 28:09.126
<i>The posses buy
cocaine for about $5,000 a kilo.</i>

28:09.127 --> 28:11.695
<i>The drugs are then brought here to
Miami, where they're divided up</i>

28:11.696 --> 28:14.498
<i>and shipped all over
the United States.</i>

28:14.499 --> 28:19.236
<i>The initial $5,000 investment
is worth $125,000.</i>

28:19.237 --> 28:22.472
<i>A girl that we had known, me
and some friends, we had gone over</i>

28:22.473 --> 28:28.278
<i>to her house for a party, and I went with
her into her garage, and I was shocked.</i>

28:28.279 --> 28:32.449
<i>There was boxes and boxes of
cash just all over the garage,</i>

28:32.450 --> 28:34.451
<i>and it was just
packed with money.</i>

28:34.452 --> 28:37.721
I just looked at her and I said, "Look
I don't care what you're into",

28:37.722 --> 28:40.223
<i>"or how you do it, I want in."</i>

28:40.224 --> 28:42.325
And she introduced
me to somebody,

28:42.326 --> 28:44.593
and, uh, that somebody
put me on a boat.

28:51.268 --> 28:54.137
The way it works is their
drop-off point is Bimini.

28:54.138 --> 28:57.107
<i>Bimini's literally like 70 miles
off the coast of Florida.</i>

28:57.108 --> 29:00.709
<i>You can go to Bimini, load up,
and then jump off into Miami.</i>

29:00.710 --> 29:03.279
<i>"Go fast boats" are called
go fast boats for a reason.</i>

29:03.280 --> 29:04.780
<i>Those things fly.</i>

29:04.781 --> 29:06.650
<i>These, like, Colombian
cats hedge their bets.</i>

29:06.651 --> 29:10.453
<i>What they do is they send about
15 to 20 of them at a time.</i>

29:10.454 --> 29:11.954
<i>This way if the coast guard is coming,</i>

29:11.955 --> 29:16.293
<i>the odds of getting arrested are
very slim, the money's very good.</i>

29:16.294 --> 29:19.362
<i>You get into Fort Lauderdale
or you get into Miami,</i>

29:19.363 --> 29:24.167
<i>and uh, you drop a boat off, and you
get a bunch of cash and that was it.</i>

29:24.168 --> 29:27.804
<i>When you're 18 years old and you
come from a very poor family,</i>

29:27.805 --> 29:31.325
<i>like stuff's just not happening
for you, that's a lot of money.</i>

29:38.415 --> 29:42.119
<i>Fifty grand a day
would satisfy most people.</i>

29:42.120 --> 29:44.453
<i>But not Brian O'Dea.</i>

29:44.454 --> 29:46.554
<i>At the height of his career,</i>

29:46.555 --> 29:49.726
<i>Brian was one of the most notorious
drug smugglers in the world.</i>

29:49.727 --> 29:55.332
<i>He and his 120 employees would
take in over $100 million a year.</i>

29:55.333 --> 29:57.868
<i>Brian's going to show you
how a college dropout</i>

29:57.869 --> 30:02.205
<i>can become the CEO of a major
import-export business.</i>

30:02.206 --> 30:04.708
I sent two pounds of hash
to myself from England.

30:04.709 --> 30:08.145
I got 19 months for that,
and went to prison.

30:08.146 --> 30:12.616
When I got out of prison, I had
no money and nothing going on.

30:12.617 --> 30:14.651
<i>So, I thought,
maybe I can kick start</i>

30:14.652 --> 30:17.888
<i>my getting back into the
world with a little coke.</i>

30:17.889 --> 30:21.858
I had $500 in my pocket,
and an address.

30:21.859 --> 30:24.761
Couldn't speak a word of Spanish,
but figured I could figure it out,

30:24.762 --> 30:26.882
so I took off to Colombia,

30:27.764 --> 30:31.368
and I said,
"Do you know, uh, Benny?"

30:31.369 --> 30:33.770
Showing him my card
with Benny's name on it.

30:33.771 --> 30:37.174
I won't say his last name right now.
I might get myself shot.

30:37.175 --> 30:39.509
So the guy, he said,
"What do you want?"

30:39.510 --> 30:40.777
I went like that,

30:40.778 --> 30:43.346
and I said "Well, I
got $500 with me."

30:43.347 --> 30:46.249
And, you know, everybody started
crying laughing, right.

30:46.250 --> 30:48.385
I told him I just
got out of prison,

30:48.386 --> 30:51.788
I got my hands on... That's
all I could get my hands on,

30:51.789 --> 30:53.857
and I'm just trying
to get a life started.

30:53.858 --> 30:56.526
So he said,
<i>"Senor, muchos huevos."</i>

30:56.527 --> 30:58.461
He thought I had a lot of balls.

30:58.462 --> 31:00.730
He said, "I'm gonna get
you 50 grams of coke."

31:00.731 --> 31:03.700
"You can cut it in half 'cause
I'll give it to you pure."

31:03.701 --> 31:06.570
"You should be able to get about
10 grand out of that back there"

31:06.571 --> 31:07.671
"if you sell it in grams."

31:07.672 --> 31:09.539
I don't know where
I came up with this,

31:09.540 --> 31:12.209
but I got a pin, and I
heated it with a lighter,

31:12.210 --> 31:15.478
and you can put a hot pin
under this cellophane here,

31:15.479 --> 31:17.647
and that will pop open.

31:17.648 --> 31:20.650
So, then you can slide the
cigarettes right out of the pack

31:20.651 --> 31:22.485
without breaking the seal.

31:22.486 --> 31:26.723
The 50 grams of coke
fit into this pack

31:26.724 --> 31:29.593
like it was made
to fit into that pack.

31:29.594 --> 31:32.596
I thought,
"Ah, this is brilliant!"

31:32.597 --> 31:34.931
I put the cigarettes with
the coke in it in my pocket

31:34.932 --> 31:36.566
with the pack I was smoking.

31:36.567 --> 31:39.569
Leaving Colombia, you have
to go through immigration.

31:39.570 --> 31:42.572
There's no just going
and getting on the plane.

31:42.573 --> 31:47.410
So, I'm going through immigration, there
are two guys there, and they go...

31:47.411 --> 31:51.248
"On behalf of the Unites States
Government, we're checking all people"

31:51.249 --> 31:54.618
"who fit a profile, who seem
to be involved with drugs..."

31:54.619 --> 31:58.955
I said, "Are you kidding me? I'm a reporter!
I'm a journalist!"

31:58.956 --> 32:04.761
But they said, "We still have to
take your clothes off, please",

32:04.762 --> 32:06.463
"and get your suitcases
off the plane."

32:06.464 --> 32:09.599
I'm going, "No!
I'm not taking my..."

32:09.600 --> 32:12.335
"Sir, there's nothing we can do about it.
You have to."

32:12.336 --> 32:14.337
I take my pants off,
still have my jacket on.

32:14.338 --> 32:17.774
I pass them my pants, cursing
and swearing, and my socks,

32:17.775 --> 32:20.710
and I reach my hand
into my jacket pocket.

32:20.711 --> 32:23.947
I put the cigarettes I was holding
the coke in on the bottom

32:23.948 --> 32:26.650
and the cigarettes I was smoking
on the top, and I flipped it open,

32:26.651 --> 32:29.619
the one I was smoking, pulled
out a cigarette and lit it.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.755
Offered them a cigarette,
which they each took.

32:31.756 --> 32:34.758
I mean, these guys are making 30
bucks a month, we can't forget.

32:34.759 --> 32:37.460
I'm lighting their cigarettes,
and I take my jacket off

32:37.461 --> 32:39.296
and hand it to them,
and my shirt,

32:39.297 --> 32:43.833
holding the cigarettes and the
coke in my hand the entire time.

32:43.834 --> 32:49.639
The moment they handed me back a piece of
clothing that had a pocket in it, shwamp!

32:49.640 --> 32:52.909
I immediately stuffed
the coke back in the pocket.

32:52.910 --> 32:57.480
And that's how I got
in the coke business.

32:57.481 --> 33:01.050
<i>After that, Brian
O'Dea was in business.</i>

33:03.520 --> 33:08.792
He got a small amount of coke, and he dissolved
it in water, and then poured in material.

33:08.793 --> 33:12.962
<i>What we used were ponchos, or ruanas
as they're called in Colombia.</i>

33:12.963 --> 33:16.499
So, here we now had this piece of material
that had a couple of grams of coke in it,

33:16.500 --> 33:19.736
and then I just folded up those ponchos
buddy, put them in my suitcase,

33:19.737 --> 33:22.972
and headed on a direct flight
to L.A. from Bogota.

33:22.973 --> 33:28.411
You just soak it in the water, and
then evaporate the water off. Simple.

33:28.412 --> 33:31.548
Of course, methanol is what you should
be doing it with, and not water,

33:31.549 --> 33:34.050
'cause methanol evaporates
off at room temperature.

33:34.051 --> 33:36.653
Water, you got to wait forever
for the shit to evaporate,

33:36.654 --> 33:38.935
which is, you know...
It's a learning process.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.830
<i>If these individuals
were putting their expertise</i>

33:46.831 --> 33:48.498
<i>towards a legitimate goal,</i>

33:48.499 --> 33:51.768
could probably be very
wealthy as entrepreneurs.

33:51.769 --> 33:55.572
We have seized drugs
in prosthetic legs,

33:55.573 --> 33:59.641
heroin in kidney beans,
in the back of paintings.

34:04.414 --> 34:09.985
Individuals swallow condoms filled with heroin.
Heroin pellets, we call them.

34:09.987 --> 34:12.856
Once that condom breaks open
or that balloon breaks open,

34:12.857 --> 34:16.958
there's not much anyone's going to
be able to do to save your life.

34:19.129 --> 34:22.098
<i>A million dollars in a
few months is a lot of money.</i>

34:22.099 --> 34:24.768
<i>But how would you like to
make that in a few days?</i>

34:24.768 --> 34:27.637
<i>Everyone dreams of climbing to
the top of the game one day.</i>

34:27.638 --> 34:32.408
Some people can play baseball,
basketball, or sing, or dance.

34:35.844 --> 34:39.549
With some of the icons being
millionaires from selling drugs,

34:39.550 --> 34:41.818
of course, I wanted... I
didn't want to be like Mike.

34:41.819 --> 34:43.820
I didn't want to be like Michael
Jordan or Magic Johnson,

34:43.821 --> 34:44.987
I wanted to be like...

34:44.989 --> 34:47.150
I wanted to be
like Freeway Rick!

34:47.489 --> 34:49.893
<i>My name is Freeway Rick Ross.</i>

34:49.893 --> 34:52.795
My claim to fame
is being a drug kingpin.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.903
At that time, I never did
drugs, I had never smoked weed.

34:59.904 --> 35:03.640
<i>I was going to a junior college playing
tennis when my car was broken down.</i>

35:03.641 --> 35:05.508
I was in financial
ruins at the time.

35:05.509 --> 35:06.676
I needed some money.

35:06.677 --> 35:08.912
Narcotics is
a thing of the future.

35:08.913 --> 35:10.680
If we don't get
a piece of that action,

35:10.681 --> 35:14.117
we risk everything we have. I mean,
not now, but 10 years from now.

35:14.118 --> 35:16.453
When they put those movies
out, that made us curious.

35:16.454 --> 35:18.188
<i>I mean it was almost like
being a movie star.</i>

35:18.189 --> 35:20.490
<i>You know, how people
wished to be movie stars.</i>

35:20.491 --> 35:22.224
That was the way I felt
about cocaine.

35:24.225 --> 35:26.527
You know, "how can I get some cocaine?"

35:26.528 --> 35:31.431
<i>We went to the movie, it might
have been 15 or 20 of us.</i>

35:31.868 --> 35:33.503
And we were all curious.

35:33.504 --> 35:36.105
Most of the older people were
saying, you know, that, uh...

35:36.106 --> 35:38.808
"You can't make any money in
South Central off of cocaine."

35:38.809 --> 35:42.545
What I found out is that the PCP
dealers made so much money for PCP,

35:42.546 --> 35:44.947
they had the money, and they
became my first customers.

35:46.549 --> 35:48.952
<i>We just kept escalating
and escalating</i>

35:48.953 --> 35:52.622
until my mom found out
and put me out the house.

35:52.623 --> 35:56.526
I was ghetto-rich at that time so I had
plenty of places that I could move.

35:56.527 --> 35:59.863
<i>The trick to becoming a
kingpin in any industry is innovation.</i>

35:59.864 --> 36:02.832
<i>Freeway Rick introduced
crack to the West Coast.</i>

36:02.833 --> 36:06.035
When people snort cocaine, they snort
so much their nose start bleeding.

36:06.036 --> 36:08.705
So, they needed another way
to get it into their systems.

36:08.706 --> 36:10.139
People would come by
early in the morning,

36:10.140 --> 36:13.209
you know, like, doctors and
nurses and truck drivers.

36:13.210 --> 36:15.778
They want to get some,
and they want to smoke it.

36:15.779 --> 36:19.782
They started saying stuff like, "Man,
I wish it was ready to go already."

36:19.783 --> 36:23.085
So we got hip, and we started
cooking it up for them,

36:23.086 --> 36:24.886
we started calling them Ready Rocks

36:24.887 --> 36:27.257
so we would have the powder
here and the Ready Rock here.

36:27.258 --> 36:30.726
Eventually, everybody started
wanting it, uh, Ready Rocked.

36:31.861 --> 36:34.964
<i>For one minute, it was
like, in South Central,</i>

36:34.965 --> 36:38.801
<i>then it moved to Inglewood,
then it moved to West L.A.</i>

36:38.802 --> 36:41.905
<i>Then it moved to Compton,
then it moved to Watts,</i>

36:41.906 --> 36:43.873
it's like a virus.

36:43.874 --> 36:46.976
Pretty much every day I could do a
million dollars' worth of drugs.

36:46.977 --> 36:50.145
There was days that I would go to
two and three million dollars.

36:53.616 --> 36:55.184
<i>I gave a lot of money away.</i>

36:55.185 --> 36:57.887
I mean, that's part of,
you know, being successful,

36:57.888 --> 37:00.156
so that you can help your
family and friends, you know.

37:00.157 --> 37:02.025
<i>Somebody would come up to
your house when it was due,</i>

37:02.026 --> 37:05.628
<i>car notes, light bills,
you know, friends in jail.</i>

37:05.629 --> 37:08.064
<i>So much stuff... You know, just
give to kids on the street.</i>

37:08.065 --> 37:11.234
I mean, it's a good feeling when you
can help somebody else, you know.

37:11.235 --> 37:13.670
One of the best feelings
that you can have, so...

37:13.671 --> 37:18.808
I probably used to take about $40,000 a
day around with me just to give out.

37:18.809 --> 37:21.844
You know, 'cause people be coming up
to me all day, anyway, to see me.

37:21.845 --> 37:24.581
So, you know, you got to give
it to them if you see them.

37:24.582 --> 37:27.016
<i>When you're a
kingpin, word travels fast.</i>

37:27.017 --> 37:29.752
<i>Like Pablo Escobar was
to many Colombians.</i>

37:29.753 --> 37:31.788
<i>For communities with
struggling economies,</i>

37:31.789 --> 37:36.025
you are a primary job creator,
community leader, godfather,

37:36.026 --> 37:38.994
<i>bank and charitable
organization.</i>

37:38.995 --> 37:41.095
That's what I want, for somebody to do for me.

37:41.096 --> 37:45.932
You know, if I was in trouble, I would
want somebody to give me a helping hand.

37:48.671 --> 37:51.341
When you're this high
profile, there's enormous pressure

37:51.342 --> 37:53.843
<i>on law enforcement
to make a bust.</i>

37:53.844 --> 37:55.745
<i>And if your operation is tight,</i>

37:55.746 --> 37:57.847
<i>collecting evidence
can be nearly impossible.</i>

37:57.848 --> 38:01.850
<i>That's when Meltin puts a
bag of marijuana into Ferral's pocket.</i>

38:10.360 --> 38:13.363
<i>California Judge Jim Gray
can explain their thinking.</i>

38:13.364 --> 38:16.966
"I know this fellow may have
been involved with drugs before,"

38:16.967 --> 38:19.002
"so I'll plant some on him now."

38:19.003 --> 38:21.637
"So, he's good for it from
before, maybe not this time,."

38:21.638 --> 38:23.638
"But I'll just take care of that."

38:23.639 --> 38:26.208
And then, they actually go to
court and they involve themselves

38:26.410 --> 38:28.811
in what they call
"testal lying."

38:28.812 --> 38:30.847
<i>And that's how
they busted Freeway Rick.</i>

38:30.848 --> 38:34.217
The cops on my case
had planted drugs on me.

38:34.218 --> 38:35.917
I pled guilty to 10 years.

38:43.960 --> 38:46.329
<i>So, knowing the cops are
going to arrest you at some point</i>

38:46.330 --> 38:49.799
<i>no matter how good you are,
what can you do?</i>

38:49.800 --> 38:53.403
<i>The first thing you need to
understand is how drug cases work.</i>

38:53.404 --> 38:57.006
<i>Drug cases are prosecuted
unlike any other criminal case.</i>

38:57.007 --> 38:59.108
<i>Here's a cop and
a lawyer to explain how.</i>

38:59.109 --> 39:03.980
It's impossible for
the police to have a normal procedure

39:03.981 --> 39:06.416
<i>in a crime where
nobody wants to report it.</i>

39:06.417 --> 39:11.788
Nobody calls 911 when they use a
drug, buy a drug, or sell a drug.

39:11.789 --> 39:15.291
In traditional law enforcement,
a crime gets committed,

39:15.292 --> 39:18.728
police try to find
who committed the crime.

39:18.729 --> 39:21.030
This is the way
drug enforcement works,

39:21.031 --> 39:28.404
you look for a suspect, and then you try
to trick them into committing the crime...

39:28.405 --> 39:30.440
For you!

39:30.441 --> 39:32.041
It's backwards.

39:32.042 --> 39:33.776
So the government
goes around sort of saying,

39:33.777 --> 39:35.712
"Let's find suspect,
who should be a..."

39:35.713 --> 39:37.946
"Well, let's try
to set some fucker up."

39:39.782 --> 39:42.018
<i>Here we are, observing the DEA,</i>

39:42.019 --> 39:44.387
<i>who've arranged to buy
drugs from a suspect.</i>

39:44.388 --> 39:46.789
<i>He's the guy on the right
with the baseball cap.</i>

39:46.790 --> 39:52.728
<i>He's completely surrounded by law
enforcement, and has no idea.</i>

40:01.037 --> 40:04.140
Just chill, just chill. Got any weapons on you?
Anything on you?

40:04.141 --> 40:06.843
Nothing? No guns,
no knives, no drugs?

40:06.844 --> 40:08.945
All right. But just to protect,
do you have anything on you,

40:08.946 --> 40:16.486
<i>The reality is that the cops don't
really care too much about this one guy.</i>

40:16.487 --> 40:20.089
<i>Their objective is to just use
him to cuff more dealers.</i>

40:20.090 --> 40:21.958
We'll lock up this middle man,

40:21.959 --> 40:25.061
hopefully, this middle man will
cooperate and get us the distributor,

40:25.062 --> 40:26.963
and we'll just go up the ladder

40:26.964 --> 40:28.164
and keep going up
the food chain.

40:28.165 --> 40:30.032
It's very intimidating
and overwhelming.

40:30.033 --> 40:32.535
I'm gonna say to you, you
know, you got a lot to lose,

40:32.536 --> 40:33.970
you're looking at a lot of time.

40:33.971 --> 40:35.238
I mean, even if...
Even if you're not,

40:35.239 --> 40:37.039
you're gonna try to sell
him that he's going.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.841
You know, you're going
to jail for a long time.

40:38.842 --> 40:40.810
If they don't know,
they may give it up.

40:40.811 --> 40:43.212
<i>You either go to
jail, you get a record.</i>

40:43.213 --> 40:46.816
<i>From there, you have trouble getting
a job, can't support your family.</i>

40:46.817 --> 40:49.986
Or in the other hand, you
become an informant for us,

40:49.987 --> 40:52.488
and we'll let you
off the charge.

40:52.489 --> 40:56.058
<i>This exact scenario is
what gets most dealers into trouble.</i>

40:56.059 --> 40:59.128
<i>One of your employees or
customers gets picked up by cops</i>

40:59.129 --> 41:00.496
<i>and turned into a snitch.</i>

41:00.497 --> 41:02.999
Yes, this was
a situation in Vegas

41:03.000 --> 41:05.568
<i>where there was a guy,
he started using drugs</i>

41:05.569 --> 41:09.004
<i>and Las Vegas Police
somehow got a hold of him.</i>

41:09.005 --> 41:10.805
And he told his whole story.

41:10.806 --> 41:12.542
<i>Eighteen-year-old Clifford Townson</i>

41:12.543 --> 41:14.944
<i>denies he belongs to any gang,</i>

41:14.945 --> 41:18.414
<i>but admits he traveled from Los
Angeles here to Las Vegas.</i>

41:18.415 --> 41:20.550
<i>He has been arrested
for selling cocaine,</i>

41:20.551 --> 41:22.885
<i>and police suspect
he is a gang leader.</i>

41:22.886 --> 41:25.354
They actually put it in
the newspaper, and on TV.

41:25.355 --> 41:27.557
<i>We were celebrities,
we were the L.A. guys</i>

41:27.558 --> 41:29.425
<i>who had all the drugs, so...</i>

41:29.426 --> 41:31.327
<i>Well, we were
looking at 55 years.</i>

41:31.328 --> 41:32.929
<i>Skipp was offered a deal.</i>

41:32.930 --> 41:34.397
<i>If he would plead guilty,</i>

41:34.398 --> 41:37.066
and save the prosecutors
the trouble of going to trial.

41:37.067 --> 41:42.171
The offer came that it would be
five years as opposed to 55 years.

41:42.172 --> 41:44.207
Um, I signed up for it.

41:44.208 --> 41:46.042
<i>And what
happened to the snitch?</i>

41:46.043 --> 41:47.977
He didn't get any time at all.

41:47.978 --> 41:51.180
Matter of fact, he was let go, they
might have even paid him, I'm sure.

41:51.181 --> 41:54.217
Federal drug money
is allocated to states

41:54.218 --> 41:58.120
based on drug arrest numbers.

41:58.121 --> 42:01.424
<i>Alexandra Natapoff
is an award winning scholar</i>

42:01.425 --> 42:04.594
<i>and nationally recognized
expert on snitching.</i>

42:04.595 --> 42:07.129
Snitches are very good
at producing arrests.

42:07.130 --> 42:10.066
They may not be very good at
solving important crimes,

42:10.067 --> 42:13.536
or getting drugs off the street,
or making communities safer,

42:13.537 --> 42:16.339
but they are very good
at producing arrest numbers.

42:16.340 --> 42:20.142
I was standing on the
side of 18, 12 officers.

42:20.143 --> 42:24.080
Everybody pack a big gun.
You hear me?

42:24.081 --> 42:27.282
And they, they are police.
They can shoot you.

42:27.283 --> 42:30.683
I'm a nobody. If they kill me,
who gon' believe who gon' care?

42:30.684 --> 42:33.356
<i>Meet Derek Migras,
a Texas crack addict</i>

42:33.357 --> 42:37.660
<i>who police demanded give them 20 drug
dealers in a local housing project.</i>

42:37.661 --> 42:40.463
Mr. Pascal told you
if you got incarcerated,

42:40.464 --> 42:42.231
bad things can happen
in prison, right?

42:42.232 --> 42:45.368
No, he told me that he
would make a phone call,

42:45.369 --> 42:49.972
and have the biggest dick
son-of-a-bitch, excuse my words, y'all,

42:49.973 --> 42:52.008
females, but these
is his exact words.

42:52.009 --> 42:55.978
"I have the biggest dick son-of-a-bitch
in there fuck you every day."

42:55.979 --> 42:58.114
So what you gonna do
if you was in my shoes?

42:58.115 --> 43:00.815
Cooperate and say what they want you to...
Then what you gonna do?

43:00.816 --> 43:03.152
<i>So Derek gave the
police a list of names.</i>

43:03.153 --> 43:05.388
<i>And 28 people were arrested.</i>

43:05.389 --> 43:09.992
Most snitches in the arena of street and
drug crime will never have a lawyer.

43:09.993 --> 43:12.261
They'll never talk to anyone
about their rights,

43:12.262 --> 43:14.630
about the nature of the case that
the government has against them.

43:14.631 --> 43:17.099
They'll negotiate with the police
officer right there on the street

43:17.100 --> 43:18.935
or maybe in the back
of the police car.

43:18.936 --> 43:20.403
All right, let me
tell you like this here.

43:20.404 --> 43:24.006
I never bought drugs from Regina Kelly.
Straight up.

43:24.007 --> 43:26.676
<i>It turns out that all
the names were fabricated.</i>

43:26.677 --> 43:30.012
<i>But cases like this
happen all the time.</i>

43:30.013 --> 43:31.614
<i>There's another reason
Derek Migras</i>

43:31.615 --> 43:34.083
<i>gave a list of innocent
people to the cops.</i>

43:34.084 --> 43:35.985
<i>Because snitching
on a real drug dealer</i>

43:35.986 --> 43:38.187
<i>can have very
serious consequences.</i>

43:38.188 --> 43:41.390
Rachel Hoffman was a young
woman in Tallahassee, Florida.

43:41.391 --> 43:42.725
<i>She was a college graduate,</i>

43:42.726 --> 43:44.427
she had a bright future
ahead of her.

43:44.428 --> 43:46.028
But she was caught by the police

43:46.029 --> 43:47.530
with a small amount of marijuana

43:47.531 --> 43:49.298
and some non-prescription pills,

43:49.299 --> 43:50.599
<i>and the police threatened her.</i>

43:50.600 --> 43:52.401
They told her that she
could work it off.

43:52.402 --> 43:54.670
She could do
an undercover drug buy.

43:54.671 --> 43:58.174
She was supposed to buy
15,000 ecstasy tablets,

43:58.175 --> 44:01.077
50 grams of cocaine,
and two handguns.

44:01.078 --> 44:04.347
She said, "Mom I don't
want you telling anybody",

44:04.348 --> 44:07.149
"'cause I'm getting
all my charges dropped."

44:07.150 --> 44:09.452
<i>Rachel called
her father just hours</i>

44:09.453 --> 44:11.721
<i>before the sting operation
was to begin.</i>

44:11.722 --> 44:15.123
She said, "Dad, I'm really
thinking about you today."

44:16.258 --> 44:18.728
<i>And that was my last
conversation with her.</i>

44:18.729 --> 44:22.999
<i>The people that she was set up
to meet knew that something was fishy,</i>

44:23.000 --> 44:24.500
and so they shot her.

44:24.501 --> 44:26.102
And at the end of the day,

44:26.103 --> 44:28.037
when the police were confronted

44:28.038 --> 44:30.439
with whether they had made
the right decision

44:30.440 --> 44:34.143
to send in a 22-year-old college
girl to make this kind of drug deal,

44:34.144 --> 44:35.478
do you know what they said?

44:35.479 --> 44:37.747
They said, "Well, she
didn't follow protocol."

44:37.748 --> 44:40.449
Now, see that's where everybody feels
we're looking to blame someone...

44:40.450 --> 44:42.752
But I asked you what happened, you
said, "She deviated from the plan."

44:42.753 --> 44:44.754
Well, and that's where, uh...

44:44.755 --> 44:48.457
Whenever the plan started going,
um, south, if you want to say,

44:48.458 --> 44:51.360
uh, where we lost
contact with Rachel

44:51.361 --> 44:55.097
because she did not show up at the
location she was supposed to have gone to.

44:55.098 --> 44:59.268
You don't think she was pushed
into it, coerced by your officers?

44:59.269 --> 45:01.137
Threatened with prison?

45:01.138 --> 45:03.104
For charges
that were never filed?

45:04.440 --> 45:07.743
Again, we don't threaten people to
become confidential informants.

45:07.744 --> 45:10.612
That's not part of how we operate.
No, sir.

45:11.781 --> 45:14.116
<i>The moral of the
story for most dealers is.</i>

45:14.117 --> 45:17.386
<i>But if you do,
name innocent people,</i>

45:17.387 --> 45:19.687
<i>or demand a witness
protection program.</i>

45:21.158 --> 45:24.592
<i>Is having a few counter
surveillance guys on your payroll.</i>

45:26.717 --> 45:28.495
<i>If you're a smart kingpin,</i>

45:28.496 --> 45:30.800
<i>you run an investigation
on the cops following you,</i>

45:30.801 --> 45:35.537
<i>so when cops break the law, you've got
it on tape, and can negotiate a deal.</i>

45:35.538 --> 45:36.838
<i>That's what Freeway Rick did.</i>

45:36.839 --> 45:39.241
I went in and told them
they planted drugs on me,

45:39.242 --> 45:41.510
that I didn't have drugs
that particular night.

45:41.511 --> 45:44.379
That I was a drug dealer, but
that night, I didn't have drugs.

45:44.380 --> 45:45.680
That I didn't shoot at the cops.

45:45.681 --> 45:49.218
What these cops were doing were going
around and doing this to a lot of people.

45:49.219 --> 45:52.221
They wind up getting indicted,
and when they got indicted,

45:52.222 --> 45:55.825
I agreed to cooperate against the
cops for what they had did to me.

45:55.826 --> 46:00.562
<i>And that's how the King of
Crack spent only five years in prison.</i>

46:12.708 --> 46:17.313
<i>It's a great idea to get an ex-DEA
officer on your team as well.</i>

46:17.314 --> 46:20.616
<i>When you're moving tons of illegal
cargo, like Brian O'Dea was,</i>

46:20.617 --> 46:22.251
<i>you can never be too careful.</i>

46:22.252 --> 46:25.688
We all agreed that we would
move this thing forward,

46:25.689 --> 46:27.623
that everybody would
go on a salary,

46:27.624 --> 46:30.459
and the deal was no coke.
If you did coke you were out.

46:30.460 --> 46:33.129
<i>The problem
was, Brian loved cocaine.</i>

46:33.130 --> 46:35.798
<i>He loved all drugs,
ever since he was a kid.</i>

46:35.799 --> 46:39.869
<i>I can tell you about the first
day at school, first period, first class.</i>

46:39.870 --> 46:41.603
<i>Around the corner came this guy,</i>

46:41.604 --> 46:42.804
<i>Turns out he was the principal.</i>

46:42.805 --> 46:45.741
<i>He took me to his office,
and half an hour later,</i>

46:45.742 --> 46:49.879
<i>I suffered the first sexual
abuse by an adult in my life.</i>

46:49.880 --> 46:53.883
<i>As a Catholic, we were taught sex
was punishable by eternity in hell.</i>

46:53.884 --> 47:00.256
<i>So I came out of that office negotiating
with God not to strike me dead today.</i>

47:00.257 --> 47:01.757
It was horrible, buddy.

47:01.758 --> 47:04.627
My mind became a place
to get out of.

47:04.628 --> 47:06.829
And so I, you know,
when I discovered that

47:06.830 --> 47:09.565
there were substances that
could take me out of there,

47:09.566 --> 47:11.299
I was going for them.

47:11.300 --> 47:12.800
And, any and all of them.

47:12.801 --> 47:17.373
<i>The moment I take cocaine, it's a
nightmare from that point until I stop.</i>

47:17.374 --> 47:21.377
<i>Coke has such an ownership
thing, it wants all of you.</i>

47:21.378 --> 47:24.246
<i>Brian knew this was
the biggest deal of his career.</i>

47:24.247 --> 47:26.749
<i>And as long as he stayed
clean, he'd be all right.</i>

47:26.750 --> 47:28.851
The first part of
the load was 25 tons.

47:28.852 --> 47:30.886
<i>And we met it up
in the Bering Sea,</i>

47:30.887 --> 47:33.789
<i>and then took it off up
into a fjord in Alaska,</i>

47:33.790 --> 47:37.193
<i>repackaged it all
in wetlock fish boxes,</i>

47:37.194 --> 47:38.727
<i>put it all on the trucks,</i>

47:38.728 --> 47:41.697
<i>I mean, it was
as smooth as silk.</i>

47:41.698 --> 47:45.266
Once it was all offloaded,
we started partying.

47:50.406 --> 47:54.276
<i>There was only one little
problem, and it wasn't Brian O'Dea.</i>

47:54.277 --> 47:58.514
<i>Brian's partner couldn't help but party
with a little cocaine one night.</i>

47:58.515 --> 48:01.282
<i>Then another night,
and then another one.</i>

48:01.283 --> 48:03.183
He couldn't stop doing it.

48:03.184 --> 48:05.854
He'd show up at the house in the middle of
the night at 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning

48:05.855 --> 48:09.558
<i>in a limousine, prostitutes,
cocaine, booze.</i>

48:09.559 --> 48:13.295
Well, when he found out that the load
came in, he came looking for his money.

48:13.296 --> 48:16.799
<i>And we were very concerned about him getting
out there with a whole pack of money</i>

48:16.800 --> 48:18.734
<i>and creating a giant heat-score</i>

48:18.735 --> 48:20.836
<i>with these bags
of coke and hookers,</i>

48:20.837 --> 48:22.705
so there was a concern
about giving him anything,

48:22.706 --> 48:26.475
giving him something, giving him
a million bucks, what do we do?

48:26.476 --> 48:29.411
So the boys decided to give
him 50 grand, and I thought,

48:29.412 --> 48:32.681
"He is not going to be
happy with 50 grand."

48:32.682 --> 48:35.784
He took that 50 grand,
he left that meeting,

48:35.785 --> 48:39.455
and he went right to the DEA's office
with the money and put it on the table.

48:39.456 --> 48:43.726
And said, "I can tell you where there's
millions more just like that."

48:43.727 --> 48:45.728
<i>A few days
later, Brian and his team</i>

48:45.729 --> 48:48.597
<i>were expecting 50 tons
of marijuana to come in.</i>

48:48.598 --> 48:52.501
<i>So Brian took the precaution
of hiring an ex-DEA agent</i>

48:52.502 --> 48:56.872
<i>to run surveillance on any law
enforcement activity in the area.</i>

48:56.873 --> 48:59.540
<i>The load came in, a huge load.</i>

49:01.010 --> 49:04.346
We got a guy out from San Diego
who has a spectrum analyzer.

49:04.347 --> 49:07.716
<i>He's able to isolate the
transmission frequencies of the DEA,</i>

49:07.717 --> 49:09.784
and on the way up,
my scanner lights up,

49:09.785 --> 49:11.785
and they're talking about following me.

49:11.786 --> 49:14.856
<i>And the moment it crossed the
border between Canada and the U.S.,</i>

49:14.857 --> 49:16.357
<i>Boom, they hit.</i>

49:16.358 --> 49:21.497
<i>DEA, the FBI, alcohol tobacco
firearms, coast guard.</i>

49:21.498 --> 49:23.598
<i>Expecting to find reefer.</i>

49:25.634 --> 49:27.770
There wasn't a joint in sight,

49:27.771 --> 49:31.073
but there was fresh donuts
made and coffee on the brew,

49:31.074 --> 49:33.876
<i>and they took that as insult.</i>

49:33.877 --> 49:37.578
You know, you can't help doing
stuff like that sometimes.

49:38.647 --> 49:42.984
Seventy-five tons generated,
approximately 200 million U.S. dollars.

49:49.058 --> 49:54.430
<i>So where do you find an ex-DEA
agent or narc who's willing to work for you?</i>

49:54.431 --> 49:56.351
<i>We've got someone
we can recommend.</i>

50:05.808 --> 50:11.413
<i>In high school, I wore overalls
with no shirt, my jeans tucked into my boots,</i>

50:11.414 --> 50:14.750
and I could yell "yee-haw"
louder than the rest of them.

50:14.751 --> 50:20.089
Well, any of the kids that we heard of
smoking marijuana, we would beat them up.

50:20.090 --> 50:23.425
The entire time, we'd be drinking
and fighting each other.

50:23.426 --> 50:28.097
<i>I decided to be cop because I
wanted to be able to fight legally.</i>

50:28.098 --> 50:30.699
<i>I loved everything
about law enforcement.</i>

50:30.700 --> 50:37.039
I learned how to manipulate
citizens into running, or fighting.

50:37.040 --> 50:40.642
<i>I was very popular among all
the other police officers</i>

50:40.643 --> 50:43.078
<i>because of the excitement
I could get them in.</i>

50:43.079 --> 50:45.447
<i>We were trained
when a motorist was speeding,</i>

50:45.448 --> 50:49.518
to get real close and then
activate the red and blue lights.

50:49.519 --> 50:53.088
Well, I learned to lag way back

50:53.089 --> 50:57.393
then turn my lights on to give
that motorist the opinion that.

50:57.394 --> 51:00.129
"I might have a chance
to outrun this guy."

51:00.130 --> 51:04.632
<i>you're addicted to the adrenaline
and you don't realize it.</i>

51:05.868 --> 51:09.538
<i>I was the best drug agent
in the area.</i>

51:09.539 --> 51:14.143
There's not a day that we don't put
somebody in jail for narcotics,

51:14.144 --> 51:16.745
for finding mainly marijuana.

51:16.746 --> 51:19.982
<i>I only had 5 miles of highway
in my jurisdiction</i>

51:19.983 --> 51:22.885
<i>and I made over
100 drug arrests in one year.</i>

51:22.886 --> 51:25.020
He's got a gun! Shoot!

51:25.021 --> 51:29.925
The DEA, they were jealous, because they were
supposed to be making all the big arrests.

51:29.926 --> 51:33.462
The first month, I performed
seven drug raids.

51:33.463 --> 51:37.065
<i>The DEA were only doing one a year.
The entire DEA.</i>

51:37.066 --> 51:39.201
And they had jurisdiction
of every county,

51:39.202 --> 51:41.537
I only had jurisdiction
in one city.

51:41.538 --> 51:45.107
I'll never forget the last
marijuana arrest I made.

51:45.108 --> 51:49.178
And something hit me, I thought, "I
make three or four of these a day."

51:49.179 --> 51:52.915
Almost everybody I stop
has marijuana.

51:52.916 --> 51:57.853
There's marijuana roach in your
ash tray, and I smell marijuana.

51:57.854 --> 51:59.855
Ladies, any of y'all got
any marijuana on you?

51:59.856 --> 52:02.057
<i>I thought there's got to be
something to it.</i>

52:02.058 --> 52:04.993
<i>Well, for years,
I had pounds in my house</i>

52:04.994 --> 52:07.863
<i>as training aids
to train my drug dog.</i>

52:07.864 --> 52:11.934
So, I went home, and I smoked
that pot, and I loved it.

52:11.935 --> 52:14.670
I'm like,
"This is what it's about."

52:14.671 --> 52:17.739
<i>It's one of the funniest
things I'd ever done.</i>

52:17.740 --> 52:21.076
<i>I married my pot dealer,
this girl named Candy.</i>

52:21.077 --> 52:23.212
Candy and I were talking,
and I said,

52:23.213 --> 52:28.150
"Should I make a film on how
insane the drug war is"

52:28.151 --> 52:31.787
"or should I just teach people
how not to get busted for pot?"

52:31.788 --> 52:34.089
All these secrets I had.

52:34.090 --> 52:37.158
And she said, "You gotta teach
'em how not to get busted."

52:37.159 --> 52:38.559
So we went by every magazine.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.929
High Times, Cannabis Culture,
<i>everything out there.</i>

52:40.930 --> 52:44.699
<i>We went on the Internet, and
nothing was out there like it.</i>

52:46.835 --> 52:51.173
<i>Coming off the success of the
</i> Never Get Busted <i>video series,</i>

52:51.174 --> 52:54.743
we begin getting
thousands of emails

52:54.744 --> 52:58.647
of people being arrested and
mistreated by law enforcement.

52:58.648 --> 53:01.550
And if I got an email and it
fit exactly what I used to do,

53:01.551 --> 53:03.218
I knew
they were telling the truth.

53:03.219 --> 53:05.888
And we were getting
thousands of these.

53:05.889 --> 53:08.257
So Candy and I were talking
and she said,

53:08.258 --> 53:12.594
"You know, Barry, you were so good
at busting all those citizens,"

53:12.595 --> 53:16.832
"you should start busting
some of these crooked cops,"

53:16.833 --> 53:18.866
and I'm like, "Yeah!"

53:18.867 --> 53:20.667
<i>No matter who you are.</i>

53:20.668 --> 53:24.006
<i>Barry Cooper's a guy you can
call if cops plant drugs on you.</i>

53:24.007 --> 53:26.308
<i>Even if you've never
dealt drugs in your life.</i>

53:26.309 --> 53:28.610
<i>My granddad
told me a long time ago,</i>

53:28.611 --> 53:30.546
<i>tough times
don't build character.</i>

53:30.547 --> 53:32.280
Tough times show character.

53:32.281 --> 53:34.281
<i>The deputy chief of police at that time.</i>

53:34.282 --> 53:37.286
<i>He called us and he said, "Tell
you what I think happened."</i>

53:37.287 --> 53:39.755
"They made
a mistake in identity."

53:39.756 --> 53:43.158
<i>Confidential informants ended up
planting drugs on the wrong person.</i>

53:43.159 --> 53:45.027
It struck me later on
that evening,

53:45.028 --> 53:47.596
it just kinda, you know,
my eyes popped open, like,

53:47.597 --> 53:50.665
"Wait a minute. How do you plant
drugs on the right person?"

53:50.666 --> 53:52.066
<i>According to Raymond Madden,</i>

53:52.067 --> 53:53.769
<i>an informant was instructed by police</i>

53:53.770 --> 53:55.837
<i>to plant a bag of meth
in his daughter's car.</i>

53:55.838 --> 53:58.073
<i>But unfortunately,
the information was wrong,</i>

53:58.074 --> 54:01.843
Yolanda Madden was a working, single
mother of two at the time of her arrest.

54:01.844 --> 54:05.314
So Raymond flew to East
Texas and met with me.

54:05.315 --> 54:11.286
And I told him how we could catch those
officers that planted the drugs on Yolanda.

54:11.287 --> 54:14.121
Because some of them
were my ex-partners.

54:16.058 --> 54:19.628
<i>Barry planted two Christmas
trees under some grow lamps.</i>

54:19.629 --> 54:22.331
<i>Then, Odessa cops
received an anonymous tip</i>

54:22.332 --> 54:24.967
<i>that a major drug operation
was under way.</i>

54:24.968 --> 54:26.167
<i>As Barry knew they would,</i>

54:26.168 --> 54:27.868
<i>the police broke a number of laws</i>

54:27.869 --> 54:30.806
<i>leading up to an illegal invasion
and search of his house.</i>

54:30.807 --> 54:33.976
Barry proved that Odessa cops
routinely break the law,

54:33.977 --> 54:36.812
<i>as standard operating procedure
in fighting the drug war.</i>

54:36.813 --> 54:38.747
Get these cameras ready.

54:38.748 --> 54:41.083
Hey, I'm Barry Cooper
with <i>KopBusters!</i>

54:41.084 --> 54:42.884
Why are you in my house?

54:42.885 --> 54:47.756
I'm busy making sure these Odessa
cops quit planting drugs on people.

54:47.757 --> 54:49.625
We're not
giving nobody no hassle.

54:49.626 --> 54:51.760
You did too. Y'all
planted drugs on Yolanda

54:51.761 --> 54:53.829
and she's in prison
because of it.

54:53.830 --> 54:56.698
That's giving people a hassle.

54:56.699 --> 54:59.701
You guys are wrong on this one
and you know it. You got burnt.

54:59.702 --> 55:02.904
He got a media event, and
that thing went national.

55:02.905 --> 55:07.676
In 2008, ex-drug officer Barry
Cooper set up Odessa police

55:07.677 --> 55:09.845
to bring attention
to Madden's case.

55:09.846 --> 55:11.813
It was a success.

55:11.814 --> 55:16.385
And to prove we were right, the judge let her go.
She got out of prison.

55:16.386 --> 55:18.920
<i>Painful memories that melt away</i>

55:18.921 --> 55:22.090
<i>as Yolanda Madden
emerges a free woman.</i>

55:22.091 --> 55:25.360
I went to prison a single
mom of two kids, 16 and 11.

55:25.361 --> 55:27.396
My son is 20 and married.

55:27.397 --> 55:30.732
And of course my daughter is,
she's getting ready to be 16.

55:30.733 --> 55:32.901
And I'm talking to this
young woman, you know,

55:32.902 --> 55:34.836
that was just a child
when I left.

55:34.837 --> 55:38.205
So, I mean, I miss the
years, you know. But...

55:40.942 --> 55:44.212
I've got lots of ways
to sting cops.

55:44.213 --> 55:46.080
It just takes money.

55:47.216 --> 55:52.187
<i>If you've come this far, you've learned
to beat cases and outsmart the law,</i>

55:52.188 --> 55:55.724

millions of dollars in cash.

55:55.725 --> 55:58.760
<i>This concludes chapter six,
How to Be a Kingpin.</i>

55:58.761 --> 56:02.129
<i>You're almost ready for the top
level, Running a Drug Cartel.</i>

56:02.130 --> 56:04.130
<i>But before we go overseas,</i>

56:04.131 --> 56:07.202
<i>there's one more way to make
money in the game here at home,</i>

56:07.203 --> 56:09.271
<i>even more than kingpins.</i>

56:09.272 --> 56:11.338
<i>This is the secret level.</i>

56:15.277 --> 56:18.947
<i>For all you government
officials out there,</i>

56:18.948 --> 56:21.016
<i>we're going to teach you
how to expand your power,</i>

56:21.017 --> 56:22.851
<i>and take out

56:22.852 --> 56:25.253
<i>All you need is a drug war.</i>

56:25.254 --> 56:30.759
<i>Drugs used to be legal.
Heroin, cocaine, everything.</i>

56:30.760 --> 56:35.230
<i>Until about 100 years ago, when America
appointed its first drug czar,</i>

56:35.231 --> 56:37.332
<i>a man named Harry Anslinger.</i>

56:37.333 --> 56:39.301
<i>In his report
to the U.S. Senate,</i>

56:39.302 --> 56:42.838
Anslinger detailed the reasons
drugs must be outlawed.

56:42.839 --> 56:43.939
<i>This is what he said.</i>

56:43.940 --> 56:48.043
<i>"There are 100,000 marijuana
smokers in the U.S.,"</i>

56:48.044 --> 56:52.314
<i>"and most are Negroes, Hispanics,
Filipinos, and entertainers."</i>

56:52.315 --> 56:56.218
<i>"Their satanic music, jazz and
swing, result from marijuana use."</i>

56:56.219 --> 57:01.422
"It causes white women to seek sexual relations
with Negroes, entertainers and others."

57:04.025 --> 57:07.295
<i>Anslinger's popularity
soared with voters,</i>

57:07.296 --> 57:09.831
<i>and lawmakers
began outlawing drugs.</i>

57:09.832 --> 57:14.401
Then the evangelical movement inspired
Congress to ban alcohol as well.

57:14.402 --> 57:16.602
<i>Gangsterism was a natural sequel,</i>

57:16.603 --> 57:19.341
<i>And battles for exclusive
territories erupted with a violence</i>

57:19.342 --> 57:21.810
<i>unparalleled in the history
of law enforcement.</i>

57:21.811 --> 57:24.346
<i>Guys like Al Capone
were suddenly making big bucks.</i>

57:24.347 --> 57:27.816
<i>The black market exploded with such
violence that public opinion turned</i>

57:27.817 --> 57:30.051
<i>and Roosevelt
ended alcohol prohibition,</i>

57:30.052 --> 57:32.087
<i>crushing
the burgeoning industry.</i>

57:32.088 --> 57:34.523
<i>But Harry Anslinger didn't
stop pushing drug prohibition.</i>

57:34.524 --> 57:38.560
<i>In the 1960s, he took his case all
the way to the United Nations,</i>

57:38.561 --> 57:43.465
<i>and lobbied the whole world to adopt the U.S.
policy of outlawing drugs.</i>

57:43.466 --> 57:47.034
<i>Richard Nixon would pick up
where Harry Anslinger left off.</i>

57:48.036 --> 57:53.340
America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse.

57:54.476 --> 57:57.546
<i>While publicly claiming
to address addiction and violence,</i>

57:57.547 --> 58:00.215
<i>Nixon used drug policy
as a weapon</i>

58:00.216 --> 58:03.217
<i>to move against those he thought
of as his political enemies.</i>

58:23.171 --> 58:24.973
To fight and defeat this enemy,

58:24.974 --> 58:29.411
it is necessary to wage
a new, all-out offensive.

58:29.412 --> 58:33.215
<i>President Nixon created the
Drug Enforcement Administration,</i>

58:33.216 --> 58:38.920
with an annual budget of $65 million,
and started the war on drugs.

58:38.921 --> 58:42.591
<i>If you are a governor, mayor, police
chief, or any public official,</i>

58:42.592 --> 58:46.428
<i>an enormous amount of money was suddenly
available from the federal government.</i>

58:46.429 --> 58:49.130
<i>All you had to do
was enlist in the drug war.</i>

58:49.131 --> 58:51.900
<i>All of us in law
enforcement, we're soldiers.</i>

58:51.901 --> 58:55.003
We developed the cases, we got the
informants, we did the search warrants,

58:55.004 --> 58:58.973
we did the wire taps, but we
didn't take the money out of it.

58:58.974 --> 59:00.774
So what happened?

59:00.775 --> 59:04.079
All the wonderful little entrepreneurs
said, "Now it's my time."

59:04.080 --> 59:06.581
<i>Twelve years later,
the federal drug war budget</i>

59:06.582 --> 59:09.550
<i>had grown to over
$1.5 billion a year.</i>

59:11.019 --> 59:13.888
And the Reagan administration
stepped up the rhetoric.

59:19.394 --> 59:22.964
For the sake of our children,
I implore each of you,

59:22.965 --> 59:27.302
to be unyielding and inflexible
in your opposition to drugs.

59:27.303 --> 59:28.637
Say yes to your life.

59:28.638 --> 59:31.373
And when it comes to drugs,
just say no.

59:31.374 --> 59:32.908
"Just say no"
is sort of a fraud,

59:32.909 --> 59:35.243
it's one America
talking to the other

59:35.244 --> 59:38.146
not even knowing how the
other half has to live.

<i>David Simon is the creator of the

59:41.617 --> 59:44.920

59:55.665 --> 59:58.099
Yeah, we were saying
"Just say no"

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.268
to involving yourself
in the drug trade.

01:00:00.269 --> 01:00:04.039
It was like telling people in a factory
town, "Don't go to work for steel."

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.641
<i>Or telling people in Detroit,
"Don't go to work for GM."</i>

01:00:06.642 --> 01:00:09.010
<i>"Just say no" in West Baltimore
is telling somebody,</i>

01:00:09.011 --> 01:00:12.681
"Don't go work for the only factory
that is hiring in your neighborhood."

01:00:12.682 --> 01:00:15.550
<i>And the country is telling you
implicitly, "We don't need you."</i>

01:00:15.551 --> 01:00:17.953
<i>You're a human being
without purpose.</i>

01:00:17.954 --> 01:00:21.556
<i>And that's 10, to 15, to 20% of

You got to realize we ain't got
no jobs around here or nothin'.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.595
You know, so, every time we try
to make a little somethin'

01:00:27.596 --> 01:00:30.598
to get on our feet, to try
and help to feed our family,

01:00:30.599 --> 01:00:34.302
they come kicking the doors in and
knocking, knocking us back down again.

01:00:34.303 --> 01:00:37.739
Even as you fall into the corner
culture and ruin your life,

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.642
um, you're granted meaning.

01:00:40.643 --> 01:00:42.744
You're granted a purpose.

01:00:42.745 --> 01:00:45.446
You're gonna go out and you're
going to sell this G-pack today.

01:00:45.447 --> 01:00:46.747
And you're gonna make money,

01:00:46.748 --> 01:00:48.416
and you're going to bring that
money home to your people.

01:00:48.417 --> 01:00:51.152
So "just say no" was a problem.

01:00:51.153 --> 01:00:55.457
Um, in that, we had not given
the slightest bit of thought

01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:59.360
as to what people in these worlds

01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:00.961

01:01:35.765 --> 01:01:39.467

the contras raise money for arms

01:04:49.992 --> 01:04:54.429
by introducing crack cocaine
into California.

01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:57.332
There's no question in my mind
there is complicity

01:04:57.333 --> 01:04:59.634
in the flow of drugs
into this country, period.

01:04:59.635 --> 01:05:03.371
A senate investigation
led by John Kerry of Massachusetts

01:05:03.372 --> 01:05:07.341
<i>found that individuals who
provided support for the contras,</i>

01:05:07.342 --> 01:05:09.742
<i>were involved in drug trafficking.</i>

01:05:09.743 --> 01:05:12.714
<i>Freeway Rick's former
South American cocaine supplier</i>

01:05:12.715 --> 01:05:15.350
<i>was a major contributor
to the contras.</i>

01:05:15.351 --> 01:05:18.886
<i>Eventually the DEA hired him
to set up Freeway Rick,</i>

01:05:18.887 --> 01:05:21.322
<i>putting him in jail
for 20 years.</i>

01:05:21.323 --> 01:05:24.525
<i>The DEA paid Rick's supplier
for services,</i>

01:05:24.526 --> 01:05:26.761
<i>and American crack cocaine users</i>

01:05:26.762 --> 01:05:30.764
<i>helped pay for a U.S. government-supported
war in South America.</i>

01:05:32.734 --> 01:05:36.437
And when that first cocaine
was smuggled in on a ship,

01:05:36.438 --> 01:05:39.274
it may as well have been
a deadly bacteria,

01:05:39.275 --> 01:05:43.344
so much as it hurt the body,
the soul of our country.

01:05:43.345 --> 01:05:47.782
But take my word for it,
this scourge will stop.

01:05:47.783 --> 01:05:50.450
<i>President Bush
Senior doubled the war budget.</i>

01:05:51.486 --> 01:05:55.423
<i>And by the end of his administration,
it had doubled yet again.</i>

01:05:55.424 --> 01:05:59.359
<i>During the '90s, government asset
forfeiture was also on the rise.</i>

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.860
What forfeiture laws do,

01:06:00.861 --> 01:06:03.965
Is they permit the government to
seize assets and money of people

01:06:03.966 --> 01:06:08.002
<i>where they believe that those assets
are connected to drug enforcement.</i>

01:06:08.003 --> 01:06:11.406
It's very easy for the government
to get assets this way

01:06:11.407 --> 01:06:13.608
because the standard of proof
is so much lower.

01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:15.977
No one needs to be charged
or convicted of a crime.

01:06:15.978 --> 01:06:18.646
The message to law
enforcement officers was simple.

01:06:18.647 --> 01:06:21.316
In the event that you are
an undercover officer

01:06:21.317 --> 01:06:24.052
and you see someone
carrying two suitcases,

01:06:24.053 --> 01:06:26.754
one is full of money,
the other is full of drugs,

01:06:26.755 --> 01:06:28.056
follow the money.

01:06:28.057 --> 01:06:31.793
Drugs coming up from Mexico
go north and east.

01:06:31.794 --> 01:06:33.895
<i>To seize the large amounts
of money,</i>

01:06:33.896 --> 01:06:38.933
<i>I was instructed to begin working
south and west bound traffic.</i>

01:06:38.934 --> 01:06:45.073
<i>I got extremely talented at seizing
money under the rules of law.</i>

01:06:45.074 --> 01:06:46.908
That's highway robbery.

01:06:46.909 --> 01:06:50.445
I have heard
a police officer say.

01:06:50.446 --> 01:06:52.046
"Chief, we need a new vehicle."

01:06:52.047 --> 01:06:55.350
He'd say "All right, go out, find
a drug dealer and seize one."

01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:58.686
And so they literally
try to find this property.

01:06:58.687 --> 01:07:02.023
If I found 100,000
dollars drug money,

01:07:02.024 --> 01:07:06.361
that paid my salary for a year,
auto expenses, dog expenses,

01:07:06.362 --> 01:07:08.996
whatever it took
to keep me on board,

01:07:08.997 --> 01:07:10.898
everything after that
was profit.

01:07:10.899 --> 01:07:14.402
The same problem comes up with
regard to police corruption.

01:07:14.403 --> 01:07:18.873
You go out in the field and
you will see a stack of cash.

01:07:18.874 --> 01:07:22.577
So you just lift maybe 10, 20,
30, 40 dollars off the top

01:07:22.578 --> 01:07:23.811
and nobody notices,

01:07:23.812 --> 01:07:25.747
and of course
there's no accounting anyway,

01:07:25.748 --> 01:07:27.782
so next time you will lift
maybe a hundred.

01:07:27.783 --> 01:07:29.717
If I found a stash of money,

01:07:29.718 --> 01:07:32.019
I'd take a couple hundred bucks,

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.589
stick it in my pocket
and then turn it in.

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:36.891
I'm not proud of that.

01:07:36.892 --> 01:07:39.060
<i>Between 2000 and 2003,</i>

01:07:39.061 --> 01:07:42.430
<i>the Department of Justice
earned over one billion dollars</i>

01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:43.731
<i>in forfeiture proceeds.</i>

01:07:43.732 --> 01:07:46.500
<i>By 2008,
that number had tripled.</i>

01:07:47.468 --> 01:07:49.069
<i>By the time Clinton left office,</i>

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:50.870
<i>Teenage use of drugs was higher.</i>

01:07:50.871 --> 01:07:53.908
<i>High school students' use of
methamphetamines had doubled.</i>

01:07:53.909 --> 01:07:57.111
<i>And heroin and cocaine were
cheaper and purer than they were</i>

01:07:57.112 --> 01:08:00.181
<i>when the first drug laws
were passed in 1914.</i>

01:08:00.182 --> 01:08:04.152
The war on drugs is not winnable,
but it's eminently fundable,

01:08:04.153 --> 01:08:06.888
and the government
is addicted to that funding.

01:08:06.889 --> 01:08:09.023
You know, the worst
thing about this drug war,

01:08:09.024 --> 01:08:12.593
it just ruined this job.

01:08:12.594 --> 01:08:14.162
You know I began
as a police reporter,

01:08:14.163 --> 01:08:16.930
somebody very sympathetic
to good police work,

01:08:16.932 --> 01:08:18.765
and I still am sympathetic
to good police work.

01:08:18.767 --> 01:08:21.903
But I have no regard
for the drug war any more.

01:08:21.904 --> 01:08:24.005
If you're a fan of
the HBO series <i>The Wire,</i>

01:08:24.006 --> 01:08:25.907
you see this emphasized
over and over again,

01:08:25.908 --> 01:08:28.509
that it's all about
statistics and numbers.

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:30.978
<i>Radley Balko is a
journalist who spent years</i>

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:34.982
<i>studying the effects that federal drug
money has had on law enforcement.</i>

01:08:34.983 --> 01:08:37.050
You need to make as many
drug arrests as possible,

01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:38.850
Seize as many drugs as possible,

01:08:38.852 --> 01:08:40.654
and that's how you get your grant
in the federal government.

01:08:40.656 --> 01:08:42.457
<i>If you're running
a police department,</i>

01:08:42.457 --> 01:08:44.091
<i>you don't get
massive grant money</i>

01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:47.694
<i>for solving murder cases,
or rapes, or theft.</i>

01:08:47.696 --> 01:08:51.466
<i>Your only major financial incentive
is to solve drug crimes,</i>

01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:54.202
<i>and if you don't make the same
drug arrests as last year,</i>

01:08:54.203 --> 01:08:56.671
<i>you won't get
the same budgets this year.</i>

01:08:56.671 --> 01:08:59.674
And yet, all you're doing is
making meaningless street arrests

01:08:59.675 --> 01:09:01.942
that have no consequence.

01:09:01.943 --> 01:09:03.843
You're just harvesting stats.

01:09:03.844 --> 01:09:08.082
<i>This incentivizes police
departments to set up specialized SWAT teams</i>

01:09:08.082 --> 01:09:10.785
<i>so police can conduct
more drug raids.</i>

01:09:10.786 --> 01:09:14.055
<i>And the U.S. government will provide
money for SWAT equipment as well.</i>

01:09:14.055 --> 01:09:18.158
No-knock raids are some of the
most cruel, horrible tragedies

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.696
<i>a human can go through
because it's so terrifying.</i>

01:09:21.697 --> 01:09:25.933
I raided over 100 houses
in my law enforcement career.

01:09:25.934 --> 01:09:29.270
<i>There'd be 15 of us
in all this riot gear,</i>

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:32.506
<i>and the biggest, fanciest
guns we could get.</i>

01:09:32.508 --> 01:09:34.575
I was always the guy
who kicked the door in,

01:09:34.576 --> 01:09:36.243
'cause I was
the most aggressive one.

01:09:36.245 --> 01:09:42.249
And we threw flash grenades in
the window to confuse everybody.

01:09:44.585 --> 01:09:48.921
<i>The one that really
stands out in my mind was,</i>

01:09:50.024 --> 01:09:53.895
I remember a blonde-headed
girl with blue eyes,

01:09:53.895 --> 01:09:56.063
like my daughter's,

01:09:56.064 --> 01:10:01.636
and it almost seems like it
was one of my daughters now.

01:10:01.637 --> 01:10:05.706
<i>And uh, she had a brother,
and they were so scared.</i>

01:10:05.707 --> 01:10:08.643
Don't move, you understand?

01:10:08.644 --> 01:10:10.978
Did you shoot my dog?

01:10:10.979 --> 01:10:13.146
Did you shoot my fucking dog?

01:10:21.856 --> 01:10:24.725
Why did you do that?

01:10:24.726 --> 01:10:27.961
And we ripped that family
apart for a bag of pot?

01:10:30.197 --> 01:10:32.567
Sometimes people feed
them wrong information,

01:10:32.568 --> 01:10:34.168
sometimes it's just an accident,

01:10:34.169 --> 01:10:38.272
where they read, instead
of "863" they read "868"

01:10:38.273 --> 01:10:39.972
and they go into the wrong room.

01:10:39.973 --> 01:10:42.977
And when they got to the house of
the former marine, Jose Guerena,

01:10:42.978 --> 01:10:46.113
he had already been alerted by his
wife that someone was outside,

01:10:46.114 --> 01:10:47.748
so he grabbed his rifle.

01:10:47.749 --> 01:10:50.151
But before Guerena could remove
the safety from his rifle,

01:10:50.152 --> 01:10:53.754
he was greeted by more than 60
bullets from law enforcement.

01:10:53.755 --> 01:10:56.924
The SWAT team refused to let
anyone attend to Guerena,

01:10:56.925 --> 01:10:58.793
leaving no hope
for him to survive.

01:10:58.794 --> 01:11:01.262
We've raised a generation
of cops in Baltimore

01:11:01.263 --> 01:11:03.664
who can make a drug arrest,
but can't do police work.

01:11:03.665 --> 01:11:05.232
You don't know
how to use an informant

01:11:05.233 --> 01:11:07.001
and not be used by an informant.

01:11:07.002 --> 01:11:09.804
You don't know how to write
an intelligent search warrant,

01:11:09.805 --> 01:11:12.974
you don't know how to retroactively
investigate a crime,

01:11:12.975 --> 01:11:15.309
you don't understand
how to maintain a crime scene.

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:18.179
All the things that count
as quality police work,

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:21.816
that's a direct consequence of the
drug war that nobody thought about.

01:11:21.817 --> 01:11:25.886
<i>In the 1980s, there were
about 3,000 SWAT raids a year.</i>

01:11:25.887 --> 01:11:30.156
<i>Today, that number is estimated at
around 50,000 SWAT raids a year.</i>

01:11:31.392 --> 01:11:34.862
<i>Most serving warrants on
non-violent drug offenders.</i>

01:11:34.863 --> 01:11:37.363
These raids gone wrong
are actually pretty common.

01:11:37.366 --> 01:11:40.166
<i>They happen, by my estimate, a few
times a week, across the country.</i>

01:11:40.235 --> 01:11:42.735
<i>92 year old Kathryn Johnston was killed</i>

01:11:42.735 --> 01:11:46.335
<i>when narcotics officers knocked down
the door at her home on Neal Street,</i>

01:11:46.341 --> 01:11:48.041
<i>and then opened fire.</i>

01:11:48.076 --> 01:11:48.975
<i>Earlier this week,</i>

01:11:48.976 --> 01:11:54.782
<i>A 68-year-old grandfather of 12 was killed
in his home in Framingham, Massachusetts.</i>

01:11:54.783 --> 01:11:56.717
<i>While drug
war money has financed</i>

01:11:56.718 --> 01:12:00.855
<i>an unprecedented expansion
of U.S. law enforcement,</i>

01:12:00.856 --> 01:12:05.059
<i>the bulk of drug money has continued
to flow outside U.S. borders</i>

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.761
<i>and into the pockets
of true masters of the game.</i>

01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:35.222
As a cartel drug lord, your biggest problem
is going to be counting your money.

01:12:35.223 --> 01:12:38.292
<i>But you'll have a few guys
hired to do that.</i>

01:12:38.293 --> 01:12:42.329
<i>And a few more guys to count your mansions,
houses, planes, boats, luxury cars,</i>

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:45.699
<i>and all the material possessions
you could possibly dream of.</i>

01:12:46.901 --> 01:12:48.803
<i>Like all the kings
and emperors before you,</i>

01:12:48.804 --> 01:12:51.739
<i>you too will have
your very own army.</i>

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:55.809
<i>Driving around in custom made tanks designed
by top military equipment engineers.</i>

01:12:56.934 --> 01:12:58.811
<i>If you're a Mexican cartel lord,</i>

01:12:58.812 --> 01:13:02.283
<i>And too many of your men
find themselves in prison,</i>

01:13:02.284 --> 01:13:06.854
you just send a couple hundred of your best
guys down there and get them out of jail.

01:13:06.855 --> 01:13:09.390
<i>The guards won't stop you.</i>

01:13:09.391 --> 01:13:13.160
<i>Anyone you perceive as being a
threat, you send a message.</i>

01:13:13.161 --> 01:13:14.961
<i>You chop off people's heads.</i>

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.265
<i>You roll those heads
into nightclubs</i>

01:13:18.266 --> 01:13:23.337
or pile them up and hang their bodies from
bridges to keep your competition in line.

01:13:23.338 --> 01:13:27.975
<i>As a cartel drug lord, you kill
anybody who gets in your way,</i>

01:13:27.976 --> 01:13:30.044
<i>literally gunning
down civilians,</i>

01:13:30.045 --> 01:13:32.279
<i>as long as you hit your target.</i>

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.015
<i>You'll be so used to killing,
nothing will faze you any more.</i>

01:13:37.284 --> 01:13:43.524
<i>Since 2006, over 50,000 people have
been murdered in Mexico's war on drugs.</i>

01:13:43.525 --> 01:13:46.327
<i>Most of those cases
remain unsolved.</i>

01:13:46.328 --> 01:13:49.797
<i>Not because you're careful
about covering up your crimes,</i>

01:13:49.798 --> 01:13:51.866
<i>but because you terrify
the police.</i>

01:13:51.867 --> 01:13:56.504
What happens when you as a public
official, or a police chief,

01:13:56.505 --> 01:14:00.274
receive an envelope with
photographs of your family?

01:14:00.275 --> 01:14:03.144
It won't take you long
either to resign,

01:14:03.145 --> 01:14:05.513
or to go along
with their wishes.

01:14:05.514 --> 01:14:09.850
The drug cartels have more money and
more guns than the police do.

01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:11.819
In a lot of ways, that
doesn't make any difference

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.320
because the police
are on their payrolls,

01:14:13.321 --> 01:14:16.601
but where they're not, they can
literally outgun the police.

01:14:18.492 --> 01:14:20.094
<i>To run a global company,</i>

01:14:20.095 --> 01:14:22.296
<i>you need operatives
all over the world.</i>

01:14:22.297 --> 01:14:26.133
<i>An international work force
rivaling any other Fortune 500.</i>

01:14:26.134 --> 01:14:28.569
<i>So where do you find
your employees?</i>

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:31.372
<i>Like business school does
for our corporate leaders,</i>

01:14:31.373 --> 01:14:33.474
<i>jails are like
the ultimate job fair</i>

01:14:33.475 --> 01:14:37.077
for gangs, dealers, hitmen,
and other criminals for hire.

01:14:37.078 --> 01:14:39.947
<i>We was in there beating
people up, robbing people.</i>

01:14:39.948 --> 01:14:42.550
I almost killed a guy. I beat him
so bad that I almost killed him.

01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:44.819
<i>You know, tensions
are high at all times.</i>

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.287
If it's not between
the Bloods and Crips,

01:14:46.288 --> 01:14:48.422
it might be between
the blacks and Latinos,

01:14:48.423 --> 01:14:51.258
or might be between
the prison guards and inmates.

01:14:51.259 --> 01:14:54.395
80% of the guys in there don't
have a high school diploma.

01:14:54.396 --> 01:14:56.196
They grow up in a single parent home.

01:14:56.197 --> 01:14:58.397
<i>So if you have no one
to show you what manhood is,</i>

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400
you'll be just like
the sharks just out there.

01:15:00.424 --> 01:15:02.134
only the strongest survive.

01:15:02.135 --> 01:15:07.135
From 1920 to 1970 the rate of incarceration
in the United States was level.

01:15:07.209 --> 01:15:11.312
<i>From the depression, World
War II, the postwar boom,</i>

01:15:11.313 --> 01:15:13.981
<i>through the '50s,
through the '60s,</i>

01:15:13.982 --> 01:15:15.583
<i>the rate of incarceration
was level.</i>

01:15:15.584 --> 01:15:18.619
<i>Public enemy number one
is drug abuse.</i>

01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:22.523
<i>In 1970, the rate of
incarceration starts going up.</i>

01:15:22.524 --> 01:15:26.025
<i>And it has not stopped
going up for a half century.</i>

01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:30.364
<i>Only 5% of
the world is American.</i>

01:15:30.365 --> 01:15:34.201
<i>But today, America has 25%
of the world's prisoners.</i>

01:15:34.202 --> 01:15:37.438
<i>The United States of
America, the land of the free,</i>

01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:40.374
leads the world in the
incarceration of our people.

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.874
We hunt the poor,

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:45.946
And incarcerate them at levels
unheard of in the rest of the world.

01:15:45.947 --> 01:15:50.351
No other nation comes close.
Not China, not Russia, nobody.

01:15:50.352 --> 01:15:51.952
There are only two explanations,

01:15:51.953 --> 01:15:55.089
one is that
we are uniquely evil,

01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:59.360
and the other is that we have
uniquely counterproductive laws.

01:15:59.361 --> 01:16:02.329
<i>And while the prison
population continues to grow,</i>

01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:05.031
<i>the demand for illegal drugs
is still rising.</i>

01:16:12.273 --> 01:16:15.276
<i>50% of America has consumed
an illegal drug.</i>

01:16:15.277 --> 01:16:17.544
<i>Do they think they can lock
up half of the country?</i>

01:16:17.545 --> 01:16:20.014
<i>There's just no stopping us.</i>

01:16:20.015 --> 01:16:22.182
Everybody I know wants to
do drugs is doing them.

01:16:22.183 --> 01:16:24.451
They don't care if it's legal
or illegal, they're doing them.

01:16:24.452 --> 01:16:25.951
<i>And they are proud of it.</i>

01:16:25.952 --> 01:16:29.390
<i>Some of America's most famous
business leaders, like Steve Jobs,</i>

01:16:29.391 --> 01:16:33.994
has said taking LSD was one of the most
important experiences of his life.

01:16:33.995 --> 01:16:35.894
Quite a few Americans agree with him.

01:16:35.895 --> 01:16:40.000
I don't think it's as much a question
about drugs as it's about freedom.

01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:42.069
Whatever this
freedom word means,

01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:44.351
we really gotta
grab hold of that.

01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:48.175
<i>Either we have the right
to do what we want to do</i>

01:16:48.176 --> 01:16:51.145
<i>as long as we aren't
hurting someone else,</i>

01:16:51.146 --> 01:16:53.981
<i>or we're not living
in a free country.</i>

01:16:53.982 --> 01:16:57.418
I'm just horrified by the way
that we think of people

01:16:57.419 --> 01:17:00.020
because of the choice of substance
that they put in their bodies

01:17:00.021 --> 01:17:01.555
to alter their perception.

01:17:01.556 --> 01:17:04.158
And we judge them
as good or bad,

01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:08.128
while we sip our wine
and have our cocktail parties

01:17:08.129 --> 01:17:09.697
and you know...

01:17:09.698 --> 01:17:13.033
Stick that hypocrisy right up
society's ass for me.

01:17:13.034 --> 01:17:17.237
Some of them can kill you the first time you
try them and other ones are really fun.

01:17:17.238 --> 01:17:19.239
And someone's lying to you
if they say they're not.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.410
Our own power as individuals over
our own bodies, our thoughts,

01:17:23.411 --> 01:17:26.680
our minds, our ideas,
and our feelings,

01:17:26.681 --> 01:17:29.450
those are not things that
can be taken away from us.

01:17:29.451 --> 01:17:33.320
And anybody who would allow
the state to take them away

01:17:33.321 --> 01:17:36.122
doesn't deserve the title
"American citizen."

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:39.760
<i>The vast majority
of drug dealers never make it.</i>

01:17:39.761 --> 01:17:42.296
<i>They're either killed,
or wind up in prison.</i>

01:17:42.297 --> 01:17:44.531
<i>But Americans just keep
demanding more drugs.</i>

01:17:44.532 --> 01:17:49.470
<i>Approximately half a million Americans
are incarcerated on drug charges.</i>

01:17:49.471 --> 01:17:52.306
In recent years we've spent more
money building new prisons

01:17:52.307 --> 01:17:54.306
than building new universities.

01:17:54.307 --> 01:17:57.745
<i>And they are beneficiaries, the
people who manage these prisons,</i>

01:17:57.746 --> 01:18:00.314
<i>the prison guards' unions,</i>

01:18:00.315 --> 01:18:03.550
they all have a vested interest in
perpetuating this broken system.

01:18:03.551 --> 01:18:06.787
<i>And famous American freedom
advocates have been speaking for years</i>

01:18:06.788 --> 01:18:09.108
<i>about the conflict of
interest for politicians.</i>

01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:13.794
Are you running for office,
and you need more dough?

01:18:13.795 --> 01:18:16.363
Adopt a "tough on crime" position,

01:18:16.364 --> 01:18:20.064
you'll get a lot of money from the
prison industry. Think about it.

01:18:25.672 --> 01:18:28.475
<i>But even the largest prison
system in the history of the world</i>

01:18:28.476 --> 01:18:31.245
<i>is just another market
for drug dealers.</i>

01:18:34.581 --> 01:18:40.788
Oh, you can find weed, coke, crystal meth, ecstasy.
Even heroin, you can find.

01:18:40.789 --> 01:18:44.557
People work there, bring
it over, or visitors.

01:18:50.264 --> 01:18:51.665
<i>Congratulations.</i>

01:18:51.666 --> 01:18:53.365
<i>As a cartel drug lord,</i>

01:18:53.366 --> 01:18:56.670
<i>You're the number one organized
crime threat in the United States,</i>

01:18:56.671 --> 01:19:00.507
<i>having set up franchises in
over 1,000 American cities.</i>

01:19:00.508 --> 01:19:03.477
<i>You have an operating budget
larger than most countries.</i>

01:19:03.478 --> 01:19:08.849
<i>You and your partners in crime make
over 150 billion dollars a year.</i>

01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:12.119
<i>And business shows
no signs of slowing down.</i>

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.857
<i>Because like any good game, the machine
creates an endless supply of players.</i>

01:19:16.858 --> 01:19:20.294
The government always says drugs are
illegal, because they're bad for you,

01:19:20.295 --> 01:19:22.096
and we're trying
to protect societies,

01:19:22.097 --> 01:19:24.698
but the government doesn't
give a fuck about your safety.

01:19:24.699 --> 01:19:27.835
The government, they don't
want you to use your drugs,

01:19:27.836 --> 01:19:30.404
they want you
to use their drugs.

01:19:30.405 --> 01:19:34.408
So every night on TV, you see
a weird ass drug commercial

01:19:34.409 --> 01:19:37.778
trying to get you hooked
on some legal shit.

01:19:37.779 --> 01:19:42.850
And they just keep naming symptoms till
they get one that you fucking got.

01:19:42.851 --> 01:19:44.718
I think once
I took my first Vicodin

01:19:44.719 --> 01:19:48.555
it was just like this feeling
of, "Aah," you know,

01:19:48.556 --> 01:19:52.759
like everything was not only
mellow but didn't feel any pain,

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.229
it didn't... It just
kind of numbed things.

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:59.333
I don't know at what point exactly
it started to be a problem,

01:19:59.334 --> 01:20:02.603
I just remember liking it
more and more.

01:20:02.604 --> 01:20:04.905
People tried to tell me
that I had a problem,

01:20:04.906 --> 01:20:06.673
I would say, "Get that
fucking person out of here",

01:20:06.674 --> 01:20:08.442
"I can't believe
they said that shit to me."

01:20:08.443 --> 01:20:09.743
"They know nothing
about my fucking life."

01:20:09.744 --> 01:20:11.478
"Are they out of
their fucking mind?"

01:20:11.479 --> 01:20:12.778
"I'm not out there shooting heroin."

01:20:12.779 --> 01:20:16.183
"I'm not out there fucking, you
know, putting coke up my nose."

01:20:16.184 --> 01:20:17.484
"I'm not smoking crack."

01:20:17.485 --> 01:20:20.154
You're struggling
with the argument of,

01:20:20.155 --> 01:20:22.156
do you have a problem
or do you not have a problem,

01:20:22.157 --> 01:20:23.790
can you control it
or can you not,

01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:26.326
and I literally thought
I could control it.

01:20:26.327 --> 01:20:28.228
And for one out of ten people,

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:31.365
this is how easy it is to fall
into the hands of addiction.

01:20:31.366 --> 01:20:36.170
I snorted OxyContin and I remember
just falling down on that couch

01:20:36.171 --> 01:20:39.640
and just feeling euphoric,
and feeling that,

01:20:39.641 --> 01:20:43.243
"This is how I should feel, this
is how it should always be."

01:20:43.244 --> 01:20:45.546
I had fun for a lot
of those years.

01:20:45.547 --> 01:20:50.784
But for five or six of them, every time
I did it, it was a freaking nightmare.

01:20:50.785 --> 01:20:52.452
<i>Once you're addicted,</i>

01:20:52.453 --> 01:20:54.188
<i>the drugs become
interchangeable.</i>

01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:56.924
You're taking things
that people are giving you

01:20:56.925 --> 01:20:58.892
that you don't even know
what the fuck they are.

01:20:58.893 --> 01:21:03.931
They look like a pill and they're
shaped like something that you take,

01:21:03.932 --> 01:21:05.632
so you take it.

01:21:05.633 --> 01:21:09.503
You know. Xanax, Valium,
tomato, tomahto.

01:21:09.504 --> 01:21:11.405
You know what I mean,
it's the same thing.

01:21:11.406 --> 01:21:13.574
All in the same family,
fuck it, take it.

01:21:13.575 --> 01:21:16.343
You know, OxyContin is very
expensive, and I couldn't afford it,

01:21:16.344 --> 01:21:19.713
so eventually a friend said,
"Well, you can do heroin."

01:21:19.714 --> 01:21:24.284
"Heroin's a lot cheaper and you can...
It's easier to get, actually."

01:21:24.285 --> 01:21:26.720
And the cost was huge.

01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:29.289
Beyond the price,
beyond the dollar.

01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:30.889
I started losing my mind.

01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:33.727
I was doing too much cocaine,
becoming too paranoid.

01:21:33.728 --> 01:21:36.430
People started smoking it,
I started smoking it.

01:21:36.431 --> 01:21:37.830
I started to go with withdrawals.

01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:43.403
I was sweating, I was shitting,
I was vomiting everywhere,

01:21:43.404 --> 01:21:47.341
and, you know, I said,
"I need to go to a hospital."

01:21:47.342 --> 01:21:50.611
Had I have gotten to the
hospital about two hours later,

01:21:50.612 --> 01:21:51.845
I would have died.

01:21:51.846 --> 01:21:54.514
Having my mom
look over me crying,

01:21:54.515 --> 01:21:57.317
over her little baby boy,
in a hospital,

01:21:57.318 --> 01:22:00.454
at 2:00 in the morning,
I just felt like shit.

01:22:00.455 --> 01:22:03.357
My organs were shutting down,
my liver, kidneys, everything.

01:22:03.358 --> 01:22:04.958
They were going to have
to put me on dialysis.

01:22:04.959 --> 01:22:06.627
They didn't think
I was gonna make it.

01:22:06.628 --> 01:22:08.462
My bottom was going to be death.

01:22:08.463 --> 01:22:10.730
<i>Within a month, I had relapsed,</i>

01:22:11.765 --> 01:22:14.701
and shot right back up to the same
amount of pills I was taking.

01:22:14.702 --> 01:22:17.304
I remember just walking
around my house

01:22:17.305 --> 01:22:20.841
and thinking every single day
like, I'm gonna fucking die.

01:22:20.842 --> 01:22:24.444
I'm looking at my kids and I
need to be here for this.

01:22:24.445 --> 01:22:26.480
It was everything that I loved.

01:22:26.481 --> 01:22:27.881
And everything that loved me

01:22:27.882 --> 01:22:31.618
was a price that I was
willing to pay to do coke.

01:22:31.619 --> 01:22:33.287
That's a horrible price.

01:22:33.288 --> 01:22:34.687
<i>And for many addicts,</i>

01:22:34.688 --> 01:22:36.790
<i>If they can't afford
to support their habit,</i>

01:22:36.791 --> 01:22:37.990
<i>There's an easy solution.</i>

01:22:37.991 --> 01:22:40.727
I think when you come from a
poor family, you wanna do drugs,

01:22:40.728 --> 01:22:44.331
and drugs cost money,
and then you see a way out.

01:22:44.332 --> 01:22:47.034
OxyContin is very expensive.
And people keep calling you,

01:22:47.035 --> 01:22:48.835
you know, people want drugs.

01:22:48.836 --> 01:22:50.504
And it was hard
not to give them it,

01:22:50.505 --> 01:22:53.674
because I knew I could make
50 dollars just like that.

01:22:53.675 --> 01:22:56.943
The day I ate LSD,
the next day I sold LSD.

01:22:56.944 --> 01:22:59.680
The day I did cocaine,
the next day I sold cocaine.

01:22:59.681 --> 01:23:01.615
The day I shot drugs,
I was selling dope.

01:23:01.616 --> 01:23:04.484
I never meant to get
in the dope business.

01:23:04.485 --> 01:23:06.820
That wasn't my plan.

01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:08.989
But it just started that way.

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:12.693
Eventually I would make my way
to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting

01:23:12.694 --> 01:23:16.096
and a kid was reading "What is an
addict" and it said very simply,

01:23:16.097 --> 01:23:19.966
"An addict is a man or a woman
whose life is controlled by drugs,"

01:23:19.967 --> 01:23:22.936
"in one form or another,
the getting and using,"

01:23:22.937 --> 01:23:25.405
"and finding ways
and means to get more."

01:23:25.406 --> 01:23:27.908
And I heard that, and a
light went on in my head.

01:23:27.909 --> 01:23:31.345
I knew I was an addict
for the first time in my life.

01:23:31.346 --> 01:23:33.647
When people asked me,
"What's wrong with you?"

01:23:33.648 --> 01:23:35.747
I'd be like, "yo dude I'm an addict."

01:23:35.748 --> 01:23:40.687
Coming off of everything, I literally was
up 24 hours a day for 3 weeks straight.

01:23:40.688 --> 01:23:46.693
And I mean, not sleeping, not even
nodding off for a fucking minute.

01:23:46.694 --> 01:23:50.831
Like I was literally just up,
looking at the TV.

01:23:50.832 --> 01:23:52.733
I had to regain motor skills,

01:23:52.734 --> 01:23:54.835
I had to regain talking skills.

01:23:54.836 --> 01:23:59.005
It's been a learning process,
like, it's been... I'm growing.

01:23:59.006 --> 01:24:02.409
I just couldn't believe that
anybody could be naturally happy

01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:06.612
or naturally function or be enjoying life
in general without being on something.

01:24:08.148 --> 01:24:12.953
So I would say to anybody it
does get better, you know.

01:24:12.954 --> 01:24:14.854
It just, it does.

01:24:16.491 --> 01:24:18.529
My name is Marshall, I'm an addict.

01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:22.829
<i>Marshall Mathers, Mike
Walzman, Brian O'Dea, and Bobby Carlton</i>

01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:26.466
would take years in and out of treatment
programs before they finally got sober.

01:24:26.467 --> 01:24:29.970
<i>And this is normal. Addiction
is still a modern mystery.</i>

01:24:29.971 --> 01:24:33.507
<i>Rehabilitation programs are
underfunded, and often unavailable,</i>

01:24:33.508 --> 01:24:35.609
<i>except for the very rich.</i>

01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:39.012
<i>But in promoting a culture of
addiction and substance abuse,</i>

01:24:39.013 --> 01:24:43.650
drug cartels have an even more powerful
ally than the pharmaceutical industry.

01:24:43.651 --> 01:24:45.918
<i>The number one
gateway drug in the world.</i>

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.829
Yeah, it's the worst
drug on the planet.

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:59.599
95% of the violent offenses ever
committed by anyone locked up in prison

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.699
was done under its influence.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:05.172
<i>And as any addict will tell
you, the quickest way to relapse</i>

01:25:05.173 --> 01:25:08.541
<i>is compromising your judgment
and willpower with alcohol.</i>

01:25:12.012 --> 01:25:14.714
<i>With legal drug companies
promoting drug use,</i>

01:25:14.715 --> 01:25:17.984
<i>it would seem almost impossible to
fight the monster of addiction.</i>

01:25:17.985 --> 01:25:21.221
<i>But there's one industry that's
mastered the art of drug dealing,</i>

01:25:21.222 --> 01:25:25.926
and they know the secret approach that could
threaten the entire addiction market.

01:25:25.927 --> 01:25:30.596
I'm Patrick Reynolds. My grandfather founded the R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company.

01:25:31.631 --> 01:25:35.234
<i>My only memories of my dad were
of a man dying from smoking.</i>

01:25:37.637 --> 01:25:41.942
<i>Tobacco is killing more than a
combined total of all the murders,</i>

01:25:41.943 --> 01:25:43.844
<i>all the drugs, all the suicides,</i>

01:25:43.845 --> 01:25:45.744
and all car accidents combined.

01:25:46.746 --> 01:25:50.550
Throw AIDS in, tobacco is
killing more than the total.

01:25:50.551 --> 01:25:52.519
If tobacco were banned tomorrow,

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.823
and the DEA was going to
come after you for smoking,

01:25:56.824 --> 01:25:59.960
the first thing it would do is it
would make it really cool to kids.

01:25:59.961 --> 01:26:03.230
We'd have a black
market tobacco,

01:26:03.231 --> 01:26:07.067
there would be tobacco probably
manufactured in Mexico,

01:26:07.068 --> 01:26:11.037
or some other country and imported...
They'd find their way.

01:26:11.038 --> 01:26:13.507
We know what works
for fighting tobacco.

01:26:13.508 --> 01:26:15.976
Smoking bans in public places,

01:26:15.977 --> 01:26:19.979
<i>high tobacco taxes, secession
programs, education,</i>

01:26:21.147 --> 01:26:23.107
<i>and banning tobacco advertising.</i>

01:26:26.119 --> 01:26:28.588
<i>What would happen
if we used the same approach.</i>

01:26:28.589 --> 01:26:31.825
<i>Patrick Reynolds described
succeeding with cigarettes</i>

01:26:31.826 --> 01:26:33.793
and applied that to all drugs?

01:26:33.794 --> 01:26:37.864
That approach was tried in Portugal,
which had a huge drug problem,

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:40.164
And the effort crushed the black market.

01:26:40.165 --> 01:26:45.105
<i>NBC sent reporters to study the drop in
addiction and abuse rates among teens.</i>

01:26:45.106 --> 01:26:48.008
- So have you ever used hashish?
- No, never.

01:26:48.009 --> 01:26:50.109
Why not? It's bad for us.

01:26:52.779 --> 01:26:55.015
<i>Portuguese Prime
Minister Jose Socrates</i>

01:26:55.016 --> 01:26:57.250
<i>was one of the architects
of the new policy,</i>

01:26:57.251 --> 01:26:59.151
<i>has some advice
for the rest of us.</i>

01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:04.291
I think the strategy
can work in any country,

01:27:04.292 --> 01:27:05.891
you just need to rid yourself

01:27:05.892 --> 01:27:08.762
<i>of prejudice and take an
intelligent approach.</i>

01:27:08.763 --> 01:27:11.031
<i>Even America's
current drug czar admits</i>

01:27:11.032 --> 01:27:13.600
<i>that law enforcement
isn't the answer to drugs.</i>

01:27:13.601 --> 01:27:17.103
If you read the research, you
clearly and quickly come to realize

01:27:17.104 --> 01:27:18.703
that addiction is a disease.

01:27:18.704 --> 01:27:21.708
I think for too long we probably
thought that we could either

01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:23.877
arrest our way
out of the problem,

01:27:23.878 --> 01:27:27.847
or solve it through some
criminal justice lens,

01:27:27.848 --> 01:27:31.650
and I think we know from past
history that is not the case.

01:27:32.975 --> 01:27:35.019
<i>Critics call the war on drugs</i>

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:39.192
<i>the single greatest public policy
failure of the last 50 years.</i>

01:27:39.193 --> 01:27:41.328
The DEA don't want
the drug problem to stop.

01:27:41.329 --> 01:27:43.830
District attorneys don't want
the problem to stop.

01:27:43.831 --> 01:27:47.132
Prisons don't want the drug problem to stop.
They're pushing it on.

01:27:48.457 --> 01:27:49.834
You know, it's ridiculous.

01:27:49.835 --> 01:27:52.105
The only person who's
paying is the taxpayers.

01:27:52.106 --> 01:27:56.776
<i>Freeway Rick Ross and Brian O'Dea
continue to give inspirational speeches</i>

01:27:56.777 --> 01:27:59.346
<i>on the dangers of addiction and
the failures of prohibition.</i>

01:27:59.347 --> 01:28:03.383
<i>I was sentenced to 10 years.
Within an hour and a half,</i>

01:28:03.384 --> 01:28:07.921
<i>I met guys in there who were
doing 75 years for pot.</i>

01:28:07.922 --> 01:28:10.290
<i>One of these guys
has since died in prison.</i>

01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:12.826
<i>And the other guys are
gonna die in prison.</i>

01:28:12.827 --> 01:28:16.267
But I got the government selling me
cigarettes in there for 50 cents a pack.

01:28:18.832 --> 01:28:24.903
Don't make sense, does it?
Didn't to me. Didn't to me.

01:28:27.173 --> 01:28:29.876
<i>Bobby Carlton,
now clean for over a decade,</i>

01:28:29.877 --> 01:28:32.212
<i>runs a sober living house
in Los Angeles,</i>

01:28:32.213 --> 01:28:34.012
<i>And helps other addicts get clean.</i>

01:28:34.013 --> 01:28:37.817
You know, it's just the money is so stupid
that everybody's a part of the problem,

01:28:37.818 --> 01:28:39.917
Nobody's part of the solution.

01:28:39.918 --> 01:28:45.225
<i>Big John now works as a union
electrician and earns over six figures a year.</i>

01:28:45.226 --> 01:28:48.695
<i>He and Skipp Townsend volunteer

01:28:48.696 --> 01:28:52.132
<i>and gang intervention specialists
in Southern California.</i>

01:28:52.133 --> 01:28:55.402
I understand that I can't do any
better unless I know better.

01:28:55.403 --> 01:28:58.905
And so for the most part when
individuals ask me for a job,

01:28:58.906 --> 01:29:00.807
I understand that
nine out of ten,

01:29:00.808 --> 01:29:02.407
they're not even ready to get a job.

01:29:02.408 --> 01:29:06.946
It's just what they're sayin'. But they're
gonna revert back to what comes easiest.

01:29:06.947 --> 01:29:09.449
The current takes the path
of least resistance.

01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:14.354
So, what's the easiest, what's
the easiest path? That's drugs.

01:29:14.355 --> 01:29:17.457
After a friend of his
was killed by one of the cartels,

01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:19.859

<i>to ending the US drug war.</i>

I'm not going to use our energy to try to
change the minds of the old Americans

01:29:52.426 --> 01:29:56.495
that made the laws and expect
us to live under those laws.

01:29:58.732 --> 01:30:02.768
I'm going to use our energy to rally
the masses who already get it.

01:30:04.137 --> 01:30:08.374
<i>And Neill Franklin, after

<i>who are demanding an end

01:30:16.217 --> 01:30:21.087
It wasn't until after his retirement
that Neill Franklin chose to speak out.

01:30:21.088 --> 01:30:25.057
What I have here is referred to as,
in law enforcement, as a shadow box.

01:30:26.493 --> 01:30:31.097
<i>And it basically contains the law
enforcement officer's career.</i>

01:30:31.098 --> 01:30:33.500
<i>And in my
retirement celebration,</i>

01:30:33.501 --> 01:30:37.237
<i>this was presented to me
by Ed Toatley.</i>

01:30:37.238 --> 01:30:41.241
<i>Ed Toatley was probably
the best narcotics agent</i>

<i>Ed Toatley was assassinated in
October 2000 by a drug dealer.</i>

01:30:54.788 --> 01:30:58.291
You get killed in this thing, I'll be
like, my generation died in Vietnam.

01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:02.862
It's perhaps heroic, but it's
absolutely without meaning.

01:31:02.863 --> 01:31:08.368
<i>Because whether you make the five
kilogram bust, 500 kilos, a truck load.</i>

01:31:08.369 --> 01:31:11.204
<i>None of it makes any difference.</i>

01:31:11.205 --> 01:31:15.308
Drug dealers and cops
are replaced just like that.

01:31:15.309 --> 01:31:19.812
<i>People losing parents, people
losing sons, people losing daughters.</i>

01:31:21.014 --> 01:31:24.217
<i>You know,
Ed's kid's lost a father.</i>

01:31:24.218 --> 01:31:27.486
And those who are involved
in the illegal activity,

01:31:28.888 --> 01:31:32.424

lives are just as important.

01:31:40.366 --> 01:31:42.402
<i>If we decriminalized all drugs,</i>
