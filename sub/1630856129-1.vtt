01:26.375 --> 01:27.208
Amanda?

01:28.875 --> 01:29.792
What're you doing?

01:30.583 --> 01:32.583
Well, I couldn't sleep.

01:32.583 --> 01:35.792
And it has been such
a hellish year for us as you know,

01:35.792 --> 01:39.125
and I just seem to be working
every day without even realizing it.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.917
And you are just constantly
anxious about your job

01:41.917 --> 01:44.917
because of all the budget cuts.
So, I went online this morning

01:44.917 --> 01:47.125
and I rented us a beautiful house
out by the beach.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.833
And it was such a steal
even though it's barely the off-season.

01:50.833 --> 01:53.708
- Wait, are... are you packing?

01:53.708 --> 01:55.750
Yeah. I thought I'd get a jump on it.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.458
Wait. I don't understand.

01:59.625 --> 02:01.000
When did you rent a house for?

02:01.792 --> 02:03.250
Today.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.875
I figured if I made the reservation
and packed our bags,

02:05.875 --> 02:07.875
it would eliminate
most of the reasons to say no.

02:09.542 --> 02:12.250
Oh, and I printed out the little thingy
there for you from the website.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.583
It's right by your coffee,
made it just the way you like it.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.917
I didn't want to wake the kids
so I haven't packed for them yet.

02:17.917 --> 02:21.625
But honestly, I think they're going to be
super psyched about this.

02:21.625 --> 02:26.042
Well, you know me,
I'm always down for a little vacay.

02:26.042 --> 02:29.500
Especially with the kids.
We haven't done that in a while.

02:31.667 --> 02:35.042
But help me out here, babe. I mean...
...why today?

02:38.333 --> 02:42.125
Well, when I couldn't fall back asleep
this morning, I came over here.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.625
To watch the sunrise.

02:44.625 --> 02:48.625
And I saw all these people
starting their day

02:48.625 --> 02:50.792
with such tenacity. Such verve.

02:51.833 --> 02:53.292
All in an effort to...

02:54.583 --> 02:56.292
...make something of themselves.

02:57.583 --> 02:59.250
Make something of our world.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.708
I felt so lucky to be a part of that.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.250
But then, I remembered...

03:07.667 --> 03:09.333
...what the world is actually like.

03:11.167 --> 03:14.000
And I came to a more accurate realization.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.917
I fucking hate people.

at least.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.292
<i>How fun.
East Hampton, right?</i>

04:53.292 --> 04:56.958
No, no. It's a cute little town.
Actually, I think they call it a "hamlet."

04:56.958 --> 04:58.250
That's how cute it is.

04:58.250 --> 05:03.417
It's a lot closer to the city and still
very far away from, well, everyone.

05:03.417 --> 05:05.833

Well, we're going to have
to speed count it here, Jocelyn.

05:13.875 --> 05:17.125
Because we're almost there
and my bars are dropping by the mile.

05:21.708 --> 05:22.667
Did you fart?

05:23.208 --> 05:24.750
Archie, let her be.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.583
Well, no, Dad,
I don't care that she farted.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.208
I-I care that she lies about it.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.667
can you take me to see
the coffee shop in <i>Friends?</i>

05:51.667 --> 05:52.792
Mm...

05:52.792 --> 05:56.250

07:11.042 --> 07:14.208
Looks like we have
some top-shelf booze right here.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.792
It says here it's not for us.

07:19.750 --> 07:20.958
Hmm. Worth a try.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.417
The Wi-Fi password is a novella.

07:32.208 --> 07:35.333
The owner must be
one of those cybersecurity guys.

07:36.208 --> 07:38.000
The kids look so happy.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.792

Relax. I bought them.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.375
I know you like to sneak
a smoke here and there.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.375
I figured we're on vacation. Why not?

10:09.375 --> 10:12.750
I want you to have a good time.
Just don't let the kids see you.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.833
Okay. Oh, hey, hey.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.208
I got another idea for a good time. Hm?

10:21.042 --> 10:21.875
M-Maybe?

10:26.458 --> 10:28.958
We've got 15 minutes
before they're begging to go to the beach.

10:29.875 --> 10:30.875
That's all I need.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.250
Sunblock? Sunblock?

11:21.250 --> 11:22.167
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Yeah.

11:24.708 --> 11:26.458
We practically have
the beach to ourselves.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.333
The undertow's horrible...

11:51.625 --> 11:52.625
Look at that boat.

11:56.417 --> 11:57.292
It's so big.

12:19.875 --> 12:22.208
Hey, Mom, Taylor just dropped a pin.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.417
Can you, uh, can you look at that
and see how far her house is?

12:25.792 --> 12:28.417
Just look. Y-You said
maybe we could drive over there.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.125
- Right? So, maybe?
- Mm-hmm.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.792
All right, that's Sag Harbor.
That's at least an hour away, honey.

12:33.792 --> 12:34.875
It's getting closer.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.958
- What is?
- The ship.

12:37.458 --> 12:41.292
Oh, yeah. She's a beaut.
Looks like an oil tanker.

12:42.542 --> 12:43.667
Must be a port around here.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.083
I read this piece in <i>The Atlantic</i>

12:45.083 --> 12:48.583
that says New York has one of the largest
natural harbors on the planet.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.583
You okay, Rose?

13:14.125 --> 13:16.167
I think that ship is heading towards us.

13:16.833 --> 13:18.042
What was that, sweetie?

13:27.917 --> 13:29.792
- Clay?
- Hmm?

13:31.375 --> 13:32.208
- Clay.
- Yeah.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.625
Wow. It's getting close, huh?

13:41.292 --> 13:42.500
You think that's a problem?

13:43.750 --> 13:46.750
Nah, come on.
It's gonna stop. It's got to.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.333
Right?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.458
Wake up. Archie, come on, bud.
Help us pack up.

13:57.458 --> 13:59.458
Leaving already? Why?

13:59.458 --> 14:01.208
- Holy fuck.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.625
Jesus, Archie, let's go.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.625
- Let's go! Go, go, go!

14:56.958 --> 14:58.667
Come on, keep it moving.
Keep it moving, guys.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.750
Excuse me, officer.
Do you know what happened?

15:00.750 --> 15:02.625
There's been a handful
of these groundings up the coast,

15:02.625 --> 15:05.667
something to do with the nav system.
Sorry guys, I need you to keep it moving.

15:06.958 --> 15:08.042
Keep it moving, guys.

15:21.792 --> 15:22.917
There's a Starbucks.

15:22.917 --> 15:24.083
Oh.

15:26.792 --> 15:29.750
I wanted to read up on what happened
at the beach but the Wi-Fi isn't working.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.500
You think the router needs a reset?

15:31.500 --> 15:35.042
Well, sorry, I can't help you there.
You are the tech wiz, not I.

15:35.042 --> 15:37.375
You know, the TV's out too.

15:37.375 --> 15:39.833
I tried to check the game
but there's no signal.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.625
You still gonna be down
for burgers tonight?

15:42.625 --> 15:44.375
Yeah, I could be down for that.

15:47.583 --> 15:51.083
Meanwhile, the kids seem
to have completely gotten over it

15:51.083 --> 15:53.125
like it was something they saw on a show.

15:53.125 --> 15:55.000
They're on to the next episode.

16:01.083 --> 16:01.917
Clay.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.167
Come here, look.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.083
Oh, wow.

16:12.333 --> 16:15.250
That's a good omen. Seeing deer.

16:15.875 --> 16:16.833
Hmm.

16:16.833 --> 16:19.375
At least according to
Mesoamerican mythology.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.667
You gonna help? Hmm?

16:29.333 --> 16:32.042
Uh, wha-- Yes. Yes, I'm here to help.

16:53.458 --> 16:54.500
Uh-oh.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.042
-  Don't, don't do it that way.
-  No, no, no, no, no. Well...

17:24.042 --> 17:25.708
- Don't, don't go in the middle.
- No, I'm gonna go in the middle.

17:25.708 --> 17:29.792
Because it'll make it harder for you.
And isn't that the point of my life?

17:37.833 --> 17:39.667
You getting some more?
Would you top me up?

17:39.667 --> 17:40.917
Uh-huh.

17:40.917 --> 17:44.458
Sure, but I think I'm donezo.
I need a glass of water,

17:44.458 --> 17:47.000
or I'm going to have
a motherfucker of a hangover tomorrow.

17:47.833 --> 17:52.000
Hey, you remember that student of mine
who was published last year? Maria Miller?

17:52.833 --> 17:56.792
Well, she wants me to write
the foreword to her second book.

17:57.625 --> 18:00.750
I mean, you know, she says
I'm some kind of huge inspiration.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.000
I never know if I'm even
getting through to these kids

18:03.000 --> 18:04.375
- and then something like this happens...

18:04.375 --> 18:05.750
Shh!

18:08.167 --> 18:10.208
- Did you hear that?
- Mm-mm.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.167
Her second book is like an exploration

18:13.167 --> 18:17.292
of how media serves as
both an escape and a reflection.

18:17.292 --> 18:18.750
Which is a contradiction

18:18.750 --> 18:20.917
- that she manages to reconcile.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.083
Someone's here.

18:23.583 --> 18:24.708
Get a bat.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.125
- A bat?
- Yeah.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.125
Why would I have a bat?

18:36.625 --> 18:38.083
I'm sorry. Hello?

18:40.458 --> 18:42.792
I'm sure it's nothing.
Let me take care of it.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.583
Actually, you know what?
Get your cell phone.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.000
Just, you know, just in case.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.083
I'm so sorry to bother you.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.125
Hello. Hi.

18:59.375 --> 19:02.042
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- In case you didn't know.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.292
Well, can I help you?

19:05.292 --> 19:08.792
I know it's late.
A knock at the door, way out here.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.542
Couldn't decide if we should knock
at the front door or the side door,

19:12.542 --> 19:14.250
and this went on for some time.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.833
I thought we should try the side door
because it has glass

19:16.833 --> 19:19.500
and you'd have seen us
and known we're just...

19:20.667 --> 19:22.000
You must be Amanda.

19:23.417 --> 19:25.000
A-Amanda Sandford, right?

19:27.333 --> 19:28.958
You, you two know each other?

19:28.958 --> 19:31.292
No, we have not had the pleasure
of meeting face-to-face.

19:31.292 --> 19:33.333
I'm- I'm G.H. G.H. Scott.

19:35.125 --> 19:38.250
George. He's George.
That's how it reads in his email.

19:38.250 --> 19:41.375
Oh. [chuckles] Forgive me. I forgot.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.333
See, this is why I much preferred life
before the internet,

19:44.833 --> 19:48.125
because we would have spoken on the phone,
you would have recognized my voice

19:48.125 --> 19:49.708
and known that this is our house.

19:52.792 --> 19:53.708
I'm sorry?

19:53.708 --> 19:58.375
This is our house. I'm the George
you emailed back and forth with.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.667
No, I-I remember the name, I just...

20:03.500 --> 20:05.833
This is... this is <i>your</i> house?

20:10.167 --> 20:11.333
Mm.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.542
I'm sorry. You think we could come inside?

20:13.542 --> 20:16.167
Oh, yeah. Hey, sure.
Y-Yeah, come, come on in.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.250
Yeah. Got cold out all of a sudden.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.750
I understand how strange
this must be for you.

20:24.750 --> 20:27.333
Us, turning up like this unannounced.

20:28.167 --> 20:31.500
We would have called, you see,
but, uh... the phones are out.

20:32.292 --> 20:34.833
Yeah, my phone doesn't
seem to have service.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.500
It's almost as if we're telling the truth.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.500
Uh...

20:40.500 --> 20:42.708
Hey. I'm Clay.

20:42.708 --> 20:43.917
- Ruth.
- Hi.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.458
- And I'm G.H., again.
- G.H.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.708
- Clay, nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.333
Why don't we... sit down?

20:50.333 --> 20:51.792
And you know, talk.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.375
The children are sleeping.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.167
I wouldn't worry too much about them.

20:55.167 --> 20:56.542
I mean, Archie'd sleep
through the atom bomb.

20:56.542 --> 20:59.208
You know?
Let's go in the kitchen.

21:04.375 --> 21:08.708
Tonight we were at the symphony
in the Bronx. Have you been?

21:09.708 --> 21:11.292
Uh... No.

21:11.292 --> 21:13.250
Their productions
are in a class of their own.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.542
He's on the board
of the Philharmonic.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.875
He likes to encourage everyone he knows
to take an interest in classical music.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.875
So in other words,
I am one lucky daughter.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.333
Do you mind if I get a glass of water?

21:26.917 --> 21:29.167
Uh, no, no. Uh, help yourself.

21:30.083 --> 21:33.542
Anyway, we were driving
back to the city, home.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.667
And then something happened.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.250
A blackout.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.125
- A blackout?
-  Mm.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.583
The lights seem,
seem to be working pretty good.

21:42.542 --> 21:43.542
Um...

21:44.125 --> 21:47.667
Exactly, right, so, um... we thought...

21:49.667 --> 21:53.042
Well, with everything that's probably
going on in the city right now,

21:53.042 --> 21:54.083
we didn't--

21:54.083 --> 21:57.542
We live on the 14th floor and he can't
climb 14 flights because of his knee.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.667
Plus the traffic lights went out.

21:59.667 --> 22:02.208
We would have been sitting in a six hour
parking lot if we'd headed home.

22:03.083 --> 22:07.208
So there was a blackout and you decided
to drive all the way out here?

22:07.208 --> 22:10.792
These roads, they're familiar.
I barely even thought about it.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.875
So when we saw the lights go,
I looked at Ruth--

22:13.875 --> 22:16.167
And said that he would feel better
if we stayed here.

22:16.917 --> 22:20.292
You know, in his house.

22:20.958 --> 22:25.542
Wait. Y-You, you want to stay here?
But... we're staying here.

22:25.542 --> 22:28.917
Well, under the circumstances,
we, we thought you might understand.

22:30.583 --> 22:34.833
- Of course. Yeah. It's just--
- Uh...

22:34.833 --> 22:39.083
I think what he means is,
of course we understand--

22:39.083 --> 22:41.875
I know it's a surprise,
but we thought maybe if you let us stay--

22:41.875 --> 22:42.958
Because, again...

22:44.208 --> 22:46.875
You know, it is like...

22:48.000 --> 22:49.667
- our house.

22:50.875 --> 22:54.208
What she's trying to say is
we wanted to be somewhere safe.

22:54.792 --> 22:57.375
Well, you know, we're, we're on vacation.

22:57.375 --> 23:00.375
Clay, Amanda, we could absolutely
refund you your money.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.833
You want us to leave?

23:02.833 --> 23:05.833
I-It's the middle of the night.
My, my children are sleeping upstairs.

23:05.833 --> 23:07.792
You come in here
and talk about refunding our money.

23:07.792 --> 23:10.875
I-I think I need to call the company.
I don't even think you can do this.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.583
Um, there's got to be
a number on their web--

23:12.583 --> 23:14.583
Th-That's really not necessary.

23:14.583 --> 23:15.500
Why not?

23:15.500 --> 23:18.542
Because we're not saying you should leave.

23:18.542 --> 23:22.708
We could refund you,
say, 50% of what you paid.

23:23.750 --> 23:26.083
You know, there's an in-law suite.
We could stay downstairs.

23:26.083 --> 23:27.000
Downstairs?

23:27.000 --> 23:27.917
Fifty percent?

23:27.917 --> 23:30.833
I think we need to look at
the terms and conditions here. Uh...

23:30.833 --> 23:33.250
A-All right, we need to find
the, the Wi-Fi router.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.208
- Okay, I'll try tethering it to my cell.
- It needs to be reset.

23:35.208 --> 23:37.167
All right, well, the phones
aren't working, Clay.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.542
How's that supposed to make a difference?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.792
I think the internet is down anyway, so--

23:40.792 --> 23:43.417
Okay, look. I'm... [sighs] I'm sorry.

23:43.417 --> 23:47.958
I just, uh, I don't feel comfortable
staying in a house with...

23:50.000 --> 23:51.417
...people I don't know.

23:51.417 --> 23:54.667
Uh, it's a blackout.
I-It could be over in a couple of hours.

23:55.917 --> 23:56.750
May I?

24:14.375 --> 24:17.083
I should have listened to my wife
and had these labeled already.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.958
Yeah...

24:30.875 --> 24:32.792
Ah... Here we are.

24:49.958 --> 24:53.167
Yeah... I can give you
a thousand dollars now for the night.

24:53.167 --> 24:56.375
That should cover almost half
of what you're paying for the weekend.

24:57.875 --> 24:59.167
It's a thousand dollars.

24:59.167 --> 25:00.792
We'll be very grateful.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.917
Then tomorrow, we'll know
a little more and...

25:02.917 --> 25:04.042
- ...we'll figure this all out.
- Yeah.

25:04.042 --> 25:07.125
Meanwhile this thing is not responding.

25:07.125 --> 25:10.583
So anyway, I say one night, it's like--

25:10.583 --> 25:12.708
I think we should discuss this privately.

25:15.708 --> 25:17.375
You know, we're gonna go talk
in the other room, all right?

25:17.375 --> 25:18.500
Hmm.

25:20.167 --> 25:23.708
- Say, you mind if I made myself a drink?
- Oh, sure. Make yourself right at-- Um.

25:25.083 --> 25:25.917
Yep.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.958
Why did, why did you tell them
they could stay?

25:28.958 --> 25:30.583
I mean, it's a blackout.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.333
What, you, y-you think they're lying?

25:32.333 --> 25:35.083
I mean, it's a young woman and her father,
they look innocent enough.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.000
They're strangers.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.542
They introduced themselves.

25:37.542 --> 25:39.708
They knocked on the door
in the middle of the night.

25:39.708 --> 25:41.375
Would you rather them burst in?

25:41.375 --> 25:42.667
They scared the shit out of me.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.583
Well, I think, you know,
that they were scared too.

25:45.583 --> 25:48.042
Right? I mean,
they didn't know what else to do.

25:48.042 --> 25:50.125
Well, here's an idea: go to a hotel.

25:50.125 --> 25:53.458
This is their home as, you know,
the girl kept reminding us.

25:53.458 --> 25:57.208
Well, we didn't ask for any proof.
I didn't hear their car. Did you?

25:57.208 --> 25:59.458
No, but it's windy.
Maybe we just didn't hear it.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.917
Or maybe they snuck up the road.

26:00.917 --> 26:03.417
Or, maybe we should calm down a little?

26:03.417 --> 26:05.625
I'm sorry. I just--

26:05.625 --> 26:08.208
This really doesn't seem like their house.

26:08.208 --> 26:10.125
The board of the Philharmonic?

26:10.917 --> 26:13.667
I don't know.
It just all feels like a con to me.

26:13.667 --> 26:15.917
They want to stay here? With us?

26:15.917 --> 26:19.083
Forget it. I wouldn't be able to sleep
with strangers in the house.

26:19.583 --> 26:23.208
Rose is right down the hall.
What if he sneaks in...

26:23.208 --> 26:24.375
I don't want to think about it.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.917
You don't think
he'd want to molest Archie, though.

26:28.208 --> 26:29.500
What are you talking about?

26:29.500 --> 26:33.125
I'm just saying I don't like
the way any of this sounds. Okay?

26:33.125 --> 26:36.167
He came here because he doesn't want
to climb a flight of fucking stairs?

26:36.167 --> 26:39.417
Give me a break.
All feels a little improvised.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.292
God, what if it's a scam?

26:42.792 --> 26:45.625
What if the blackout
and whatever

26:45.625 --> 26:47.333
that's just all part of the story?

26:47.333 --> 26:48.750
I don't think they made that up.

26:48.750 --> 26:51.417
I mean, that's probably why the phones
and the internet aren't working.

26:51.417 --> 26:53.917
And besides, hey. He had the keys.

26:53.917 --> 26:56.125
He opened up the liquor cabinet. Remember?

26:56.125 --> 26:57.625
So what if he had the keys?

26:57.625 --> 27:01.167
Maybe he's the handyman.
She's the housekeeper.

27:01.167 --> 27:03.958
The housekeeper always knows
where the stash of money is.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.750
And besides, he had his back to us.
Maybe he broke into it.

27:06.750 --> 27:10.000
I don't see what he has to gain
by giving us a thousand bucks.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
Why are you trying so hard to believe
everyone except your own wife?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.875
Something is happening
and I don't trust them.

27:17.875 --> 27:22.750
I think they are scared, nice people
who need a place to spend the night.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.500
All right, I'm going to go down there
and I'm going to talk to them,

27:26.500 --> 27:30.167
and if I get a bad vibe,
I-I'm going to say, "No.

27:30.167 --> 27:32.917
We're not comfortable
with this arrangement."

27:32.917 --> 27:36.042
Okay? But if things are cool,
I say we let them stay.

27:37.542 --> 27:39.167
I wish I had your faith in people.

27:49.667 --> 27:53.542
My own signature cocktail.
Happy to make you one.

27:54.167 --> 27:55.542
Yeah, you know, I might have a drink.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.917
Haven't touched
this one yet, it's all yours.

27:57.917 --> 27:59.125
Oh, thank you.

28:02.667 --> 28:03.667
How about you, Amanda?

28:04.958 --> 28:06.208
What's in it, exactly?

28:09.125 --> 28:10.958
That is a heck of a cocktail.

28:10.958 --> 28:12.833
You should try this, babe.
I think you'd dig it.

28:13.875 --> 28:14.875
I'll pass.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.458
I think I need some fresh air.

28:28.458 --> 28:29.708
Um...

28:31.625 --> 28:32.917
You have a beautiful home.

28:33.750 --> 28:35.667
We love it. Glad to hear you do, too.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.125
- How long have you been here?

28:38.125 --> 28:39.792
Oh... Bought it almost...

28:40.708 --> 28:41.958
...twenty years ago now.

28:41.958 --> 28:44.083
But, at this point, it's... it's home.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.583
Or a home away from home.

28:46.583 --> 28:50.417
We fixed it up about five years back.
We had a great contractor.

28:50.417 --> 28:52.625
- A lot of little details were his idea.
- Hmm.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.042
Whereabouts is your place in the city?

28:55.042 --> 28:57.833
We are on Park between 81st and 82nd.

28:58.542 --> 28:59.417
What about you?

28:59.417 --> 29:01.708
Uh, Brooklyn. Sunset Park.

29:01.708 --> 29:03.500
Well, it's actually Park Slope.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.583
- Ah, very nice.
- Mm-hmm.

29:05.583 --> 29:08.500
That's where everyone
wants to live these days. Affordable, too.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.958
I think even Ruth looked over there

29:11.958 --> 29:13.792
when she was thinking
about flying the coop.

29:14.375 --> 29:18.042
Where's your wife? I'm curious if you're
worried about her in the city.

29:19.292 --> 29:21.625
She's on a work trip in Morocco.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.417
She's an art dealer so she travels a lot.

29:24.417 --> 29:26.625
Her flight is due back here
in the morning, actually.

29:26.625 --> 29:27.708
Uh-huh.

29:28.625 --> 29:29.958
Could I see your ID?

29:29.958 --> 29:30.917
Oh, Amanda.

29:30.917 --> 29:32.333
It's a fair ask.

29:32.333 --> 29:34.625
You're a stranger showing up
in the middle of the night

29:34.625 --> 29:36.208
and my kids are upstairs.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.167
Of course. I understand.

29:45.708 --> 29:47.667
Mm, well.

29:48.208 --> 29:50.500
You're not going to believe this but I...

29:51.417 --> 29:55.375
left my wallet in my coat pocket,
which I checked at the symphony.

29:55.375 --> 29:57.833
In all the commotion,
I must have forgotten it there.

29:58.875 --> 30:02.583
You said you heard about the blackout
while you were on your way home.

30:10.333 --> 30:12.583
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

30:12.583 --> 30:17.333
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

30:17.333 --> 30:18.625
<i>This is a national emergency...</i>

30:18.625 --> 30:22.167
Well. Looks like you did the right thing
getting out of the city.

30:23.625 --> 30:26.125
- I'm sure it's a mess.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.333
Well, we're only talking
about a blackout here.

30:28.333 --> 30:31.042
- A blackout is not nothing.

30:31.042 --> 30:34.958
It could be something. The symptom
of something bigger, like terrorism

30:34.958 --> 30:38.417
or a bomb like the one that you said
your son would sleep through.

30:38.417 --> 30:40.125
Ruth.

30:40.125 --> 30:43.125
<i>...all radio stations
and television networks will cease...</i>

30:43.125 --> 30:45.167
I think that you should stay here tonight.

30:45.167 --> 30:46.208
<i>...this is a national emergency...</i>

30:46.208 --> 30:49.458
Tomorrow, we'll sort through everything.

30:49.958 --> 30:52.250
Things always look different
by the light of day.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.667
I guess self-help clichés
are rooted in some truth, huh?

31:08.875 --> 31:11.208
I can't believe
we're staying in the basement.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.583
What do we get to do tomorrow?
Their laundry?

31:19.875 --> 31:21.792
I'll take the floor. You take the bed.

31:31.750 --> 31:33.292
We need to get them out of here.

31:36.292 --> 31:38.208
We're not going to do that
by scaring them.

31:40.083 --> 31:42.083
They need to think
everything's going to be okay.

31:44.542 --> 31:46.583
Everything is going to be okay, isn't it?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.542
What's going on?
What are you thinking?

32:01.167 --> 32:03.667
Your client didn't tell you
anything else, did he?

32:04.917 --> 32:07.500
There's no point in talking about this
until we know more.

32:12.542 --> 32:13.833
That's what I think.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.375
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

32:23.375 --> 32:28.125
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

32:28.125 --> 32:30.208
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

32:30.208 --> 32:34.708
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

32:38.375 --> 32:40.167
She was fucking with us.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.583
That girl. She was poking.

32:42.583 --> 32:44.625
Don't take it so personal.

32:44.625 --> 32:48.000
I don't think I can listen to
much more of that snark.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.750
Even if this does turn out
to be their house.

32:50.750 --> 32:51.958
Are we still on that?

32:51.958 --> 32:54.792
Well, there is not one photo on the wall.

32:54.792 --> 32:58.583
Not a wedding picture of the supposed
art dealer wife on the business trip

32:58.583 --> 33:00.833
or that spoiled brat as a baby.
Think about it.

33:00.833 --> 33:05.583
I'm sure they take them down when
they rent the house for privacy concerns.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.542
There's just something off about them.

33:11.500 --> 33:15.667
Why didn't you say anything about
what we saw at the beach today? That boat.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.042
It was an oil tanker.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.875
Well, why didn't you? Tell them, I mean.

33:21.458 --> 33:25.500
I don't know.
Just seemed like it was piling on.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.375
Why didn't you?

33:29.667 --> 33:30.958
I was afraid.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.500
Afraid of what?

33:35.417 --> 33:36.958
That it would confirm something.

33:46.292 --> 33:50.583
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

33:51.292 --> 33:53.417
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

33:53.417 --> 33:57.833
<i>All radio stations and televisions will
cease their programs during this alert.</i>

33:58.583 --> 34:00.125
<i>- This is a national...</i>

34:27.833 --> 34:28.667
<i>Mom.</i>

34:29.583 --> 34:30.417
<i>Mom.</i>

34:31.667 --> 34:32.708
Mom.

34:32.708 --> 34:34.667
Rosie. Rose.

34:34.667 --> 34:38.958
Mom, two problems. One: I was literally
about to start the <i>Friends</i> series finale,

34:38.958 --> 34:41.750
but the internet on my iPad
still isn't working.

34:41.750 --> 34:45.417
I tried to watch it on the TV
because I read somewhere that they--

34:45.417 --> 34:48.167
What's it called when they used to play
old things over and over again?

34:50.625 --> 34:51.458
Reruns.

34:52.375 --> 34:53.542
Why do they do that again?

34:54.375 --> 34:56.750
I don't know, Rosie.
We were really bored back then.

34:57.667 --> 35:00.792
Anyway, th-there's something wrong
with the TV. It's all messed up.

35:00.792 --> 35:03.667
That's problem number two.
Please fix this.

35:03.667 --> 35:06.792
I have incredible anxiety about
how they're going to wrap up the show.

35:06.792 --> 35:09.333
Don't you think you're taking this
a little too seriously?

35:09.333 --> 35:12.000
This isn't fair. It's a vacation.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.250
Dad said on vacation we can have
as much screen time as we want.

35:15.250 --> 35:18.708
Well. A: <i>I</i> did not say that.

35:19.292 --> 35:22.417
And B: Daddy is still sleeping.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.583
Just go wait in the living room.
I'm coming.

35:49.667 --> 35:50.500
Clay.

35:51.292 --> 35:54.167
- Get up. Look. Look.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.417
- It doesn't say anything.
- What?

36:02.458 --> 36:04.542
- It was just there.
- Mm, you sure? What did it say?

36:05.125 --> 36:06.792
Yes, of course I'm sure.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.083
There were four news alerts. Um...

36:10.750 --> 36:14.458
Uh, two about the blackout
and one that said, um...

36:14.458 --> 36:16.375
hackers were behind
the power outage.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.125
- Hackers?
- Yeah.

36:18.125 --> 36:21.833
And then there was one that said, uh,
"breaking" but then it was just gibberish.

36:21.833 --> 36:23.917
No words, just random letters.

36:23.917 --> 36:26.500
Maybe they hacked the cell network?

36:28.500 --> 36:29.958
Is that-Is that a question?

36:29.958 --> 36:32.625
Are you fucking asking me?
How would I know?

36:32.625 --> 36:35.375
Why are you being
so nonplussed about all of this?

36:35.375 --> 36:38.000
Did you forget those people
are still in our house?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.750
- I trusted you to handle this.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.000
I'm gonna drive into town.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.708
I'll go to the store, buy a newspaper,

36:45.708 --> 36:48.250
find someone who knows more than we do.

36:48.250 --> 36:50.750
All right?
I will take care of this for us.

36:58.708 --> 36:59.708
Whose car is that?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.042
Looks expensive.

37:03.667 --> 37:04.792
Let's get some breakfast.

37:12.667 --> 37:15.792
Uh, so listen, honey. About that car.

37:16.792 --> 37:19.458
Last night, these people...

37:20.125 --> 37:23.292
...the Scotts. They had to come by.

37:23.292 --> 37:24.375
There's been...

37:24.917 --> 37:27.083
...um, they had a problem

37:27.083 --> 37:29.833
and they weren't far from here.
So they, they came here.

37:29.833 --> 37:31.583
What are you even talking about?

37:31.583 --> 37:32.958
I'll take some of that coffee.

37:32.958 --> 37:35.292
Oh. I was just telling Rose
about the Scotts.

37:36.250 --> 37:37.792
- Dad, the TV isn't working.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, baby.

37:37.792 --> 37:39.875
- Come on.
- Dad, can you fix it?

37:39.875 --> 37:41.292
Uh...

37:41.292 --> 37:42.292
Yeah.

37:42.292 --> 37:43.208
Um...

37:43.958 --> 37:47.667
Well, now it's snow.
Last night it was a blue screen.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.083
- I wonder what that means.
- What?

37:51.375 --> 37:52.542
Yeah, see?

37:53.750 --> 37:56.458
No. It's just- it's not working.

37:56.458 --> 37:58.958
I'm aware. Can you like,
reboot it or something?

37:58.958 --> 38:02.125
- Or go up on the roof or whatever?
- No one's going on the roof.

38:02.125 --> 38:04.375
I am definitely not going up on the roof.

38:04.375 --> 38:06.792
Okay? But I'm going
to go to the store later

38:06.792 --> 38:09.375
and maybe I can find something
that will, you know, help.

38:09.375 --> 38:12.167
You know, get one of those, uh,
some rabbit ears or something.

38:12.167 --> 38:14.000
Why would a rabbit's ear help?

39:43.292 --> 39:44.125
Good morning.

39:45.042 --> 39:46.375
You mind if I have some coffee?

39:46.375 --> 39:48.917
Help yourself.
You know where the mugs are, right?

39:54.792 --> 39:57.667
I had news alerts
on my phone this morning.

39:57.667 --> 39:59.333
- Your phone is working?
- No.

39:59.333 --> 40:03.083
They must have come in overnight somehow,
and then they disappeared.

40:04.458 --> 40:05.458
What did they say?

40:06.667 --> 40:10.750
There were two about the blackout and then
something about hackers being behind it.

40:10.750 --> 40:11.833
- Hackers?
- Mm-hmm.

40:12.625 --> 40:14.708
Where are the power plants
in New York City?

40:14.708 --> 40:17.333
I mean, they must be in Queens, I guess.
Or-Or near the river?

40:17.333 --> 40:19.333
Why are you asking about power plants?

40:19.333 --> 40:20.833
Hackers can get into power plants.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.750
That's probably how
they caused the outage.

40:22.750 --> 40:25.042
You remember that thing
that happened in Jersey a few years back?

40:25.042 --> 40:26.667
It nearly caused a meltdown.

40:29.583 --> 40:31.250
Is that your daughter out there?

40:33.292 --> 40:35.417
She's sweet. How old is she?

40:36.375 --> 40:37.958
Thirteen, last month.

40:37.958 --> 40:39.250
Hmm.

40:39.250 --> 40:41.083
Still kind of a baby at heart.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.750
If it's okay with you, I would like to
keep what's going on between the adults.

40:46.750 --> 40:48.167
The kids like the pool.

40:48.167 --> 40:51.125
I'm just going to encourage them
to do that until we know more.

40:51.125 --> 40:53.000
I don't want them to panic over nothing.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.708
I don't want to scare anyone
but I disagree with you.

40:56.917 --> 40:58.708
Disagree with me about what?

40:59.583 --> 41:01.375
I don't think this is nothing.

41:07.167 --> 41:09.875
So, what is it that you do?

41:11.000 --> 41:12.250
Um...

41:13.333 --> 41:17.417
I'm in advertising, on the client side.
I manage relationships.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.958
Huh. I would not have guessed that.

41:21.833 --> 41:23.458
And what about your husband?

41:23.958 --> 41:26.292
Uh, Clay is a professor at City College.

41:26.292 --> 41:28.417
English and media studies.

41:28.417 --> 41:31.625
You know, I've had plenty of friends
major in media studies

41:31.625 --> 41:33.500
but I never know what it means.

41:35.375 --> 41:36.875
And you, what is it that you do?

41:37.708 --> 41:39.750
Me, I'm...

41:39.750 --> 41:42.875
I'm still figuring my shit out,
trying not to rush into anything.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.708
The last thing that I want
is to be sucked into a career

41:45.708 --> 41:47.000
that I regret ten years from now

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
by which point I will be trapped
by the pressure to stay the course

41:50.000 --> 41:52.833
because I'll be too old to re-enter
the workforce. You know what I mean.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.792
Morning. Any news?

41:58.083 --> 41:59.833
Phone's still not working.

41:59.833 --> 42:02.417
Looks like the TV's out. Where's Clay?

42:02.417 --> 42:04.500
He went to the store to get a newspaper.

42:04.500 --> 42:08.542
Or try to find someone to talk to,
to see if they know what's going on.

42:08.542 --> 42:12.500
Smart. I thought I'd go over
to our neighbors house, the Huxleys.

42:13.083 --> 42:16.125
- They only live a few miles down the road.
- And you think they'll be home?

42:16.125 --> 42:17.667
Unlikely.

42:17.667 --> 42:19.750
You often see no one here
around this time,

42:19.750 --> 42:21.417
but I'll drive over anyway and check.

42:22.167 --> 42:25.083
Before you go, you might
want to hear about the alerts.

42:27.167 --> 42:28.333
Alerts?

42:28.333 --> 42:32.042
Oh, I had news alerts
on my phone this morning.

42:32.042 --> 42:34.292
Two of them were about the blackout

42:34.292 --> 42:38.958
but then there was one that said something
about maybe hackers were behind it.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Uh-huh.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
What? Do you think
there's going to be a meltdown, too?

42:46.333 --> 42:49.542
- Is that what Ruth told you?
- Among other horrifying things, yes.

42:49.542 --> 42:52.542
Well, obviously
Ruth is being a little paranoid.

42:52.542 --> 42:54.250
Aren't you the one who always said,

42:54.250 --> 42:57.125
"If you're not paranoid by now,
it's probably too late"?

42:59.792 --> 43:02.375
I'm sure this'll
turn out to be a big nothing.

43:02.375 --> 43:04.542
Like that Love You bug.

43:06.667 --> 43:07.667
Is that coffee?

43:09.250 --> 43:12.375
I-I'm sorry. What's a Love You bug?

43:12.917 --> 43:14.750
Um, it was a computer worm.

43:14.750 --> 43:17.333
Spread throughout
the internet back in 2000.

43:17.333 --> 43:20.417
People would get an email with
the subject line that read "I love you."

43:20.417 --> 43:23.917
You clicked on the attachment,
it would send it to all your contacts.

43:23.917 --> 43:27.083
It crippled businesses
and caused billions of dollars in damages.

43:27.083 --> 43:30.000
Turns out, it was just
two teenagers in the Philippines.

43:31.458 --> 43:33.333
Could be just as innocent as that.

43:46.875 --> 43:48.667
I think I'll go rush Archie along.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.667
I'm worried about Mom.

44:06.292 --> 44:07.792
You think her flight is going to be okay?

44:11.292 --> 44:12.125
Sure.

44:15.875 --> 44:17.167
Matter of fact, I bet she's...

44:18.375 --> 44:20.583
...been redirected
to some airport in Ohio.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.875
She's probably cursing out
every customer service rep

44:24.875 --> 44:26.333
till they put her on a plane home.

44:29.792 --> 44:32.000
Do you remember that time
the three of us went to Italy?

44:34.792 --> 44:35.792
Yeah, I do.

44:40.250 --> 44:41.333
What made you think of that?

44:42.875 --> 44:44.583
I don't know what else to think about.

45:09.750 --> 45:11.750
Yeah.

47:21.375 --> 47:24.417
<i>♪ Oh, it's the winter of the wanted ♪</i>

47:25.000 --> 47:27.833
<i>♪ Yeah, it's the hardest part of nature ♪</i>

47:29.292 --> 47:31.500
<i>♪ Lord have mercy on this creature ♪</i>

47:32.708 --> 47:34.667
<i>♪ Give me some heat
I know you've got it ♪</i>

47:42.292 --> 47:44.208
Who'd Mom say these people were again?

47:47.583 --> 47:48.917
What're you looking at?

48:25.542 --> 48:26.875
<i>...we're now getting reports</i>

48:26.875 --> 48:28.917
<i>that the fallout
from the ongoing Cyber attack</i>

48:28.917 --> 48:32.083
<i>has led to a catastrophic
environmental disaster in the South,</i>

48:32.083 --> 48:34.500
<i>impacting animal migration patterns--</i>

49:39.792 --> 49:41.875
Archie, I saw something this morning.

49:43.167 --> 49:44.042
Deer.

49:44.042 --> 49:45.750
They're everywhere, dumbass.

49:46.792 --> 49:49.625
They're like squirrels or pigeons.

49:49.625 --> 49:50.917
Who cares?

49:50.917 --> 49:52.625
No, this was different. Like...

49:53.208 --> 49:55.042
...they were trying to tell us something.

49:57.167 --> 49:58.625
Let's see what else is out there.

50:00.875 --> 50:02.667
Are you really that bored?

50:02.667 --> 50:04.833
Is this because you can't watch your show?

50:05.583 --> 50:06.625
I'm going.

50:21.167 --> 50:24.792
Hello, anyone home?
It's G.H. I let myself in.

50:57.583 --> 50:58.417
Hello?

51:04.750 --> 51:06.167
What's in that thing?

51:09.417 --> 51:10.417
Let's open it and see.

51:42.417 --> 51:44.250
- Yeah? Hey, hi.
- Hello!

51:50.958 --> 51:53.792
Okay, I-I don't understand what you're
saying. I don't, I don't speak, um...

51:53.792 --> 51:55.125
I don't speak Spanish.

52:13.083 --> 52:15.000
This place is so fucking boring.

52:17.292 --> 52:18.125
Yeah.

52:24.250 --> 52:26.750
Maybe it's just where he sleeps, though.

52:28.583 --> 52:29.875
Where he hides at night.

52:31.083 --> 52:31.917
Who?

52:33.792 --> 52:35.083
Whoever made that impression.

53:13.250 --> 53:16.833
I-I don't, I don't know where I am.
I'm trying to get to town.

53:18.375 --> 53:21.458
No, no, I-I don't have any service either.

53:28.583 --> 53:30.583
Listen, listen...

53:32.250 --> 53:33.417
Look, he's, uh...

53:34.167 --> 53:35.792
He's got this little window over here.

53:36.833 --> 53:38.375
So he can see...

53:40.125 --> 53:40.958
See what?

53:43.958 --> 53:46.125
No, o-okay. Okay. I-I...

53:57.375 --> 53:58.917
Sorry.

54:54.917 --> 54:55.958
Hey.

54:55.958 --> 54:58.500
Isn't that the room you were sleeping in?

55:34.042 --> 55:35.042
Shit...

55:48.083 --> 55:49.708
Just imagine.

55:49.708 --> 55:51.375
It's all dark out here.

56:05.083 --> 56:06.667
Oh, my God.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.292
Your little bedside lamp is glowing.

56:23.208 --> 56:24.250
Oh, shit.

56:27.583 --> 56:28.417
Oh, shit!

56:28.417 --> 56:31.833
He could just
follow that light right up to you.

56:41.667 --> 56:43.583
Oh, shit.

56:46.542 --> 56:48.208
- Ah!

56:48.208 --> 56:50.542
That's not funny, Archie.
That really hurt.

56:50.542 --> 56:51.583
You'll be fine.

56:51.583 --> 56:52.708
No, I won't.

56:52.708 --> 56:55.417
Dude, calm the fuck down.
It was just a joke.

56:58.458 --> 57:00.333
This morning I saw deer.

57:00.333 --> 57:03.500
Not a deer, a fuck lot of deer. A hundred.

57:03.500 --> 57:06.500
Maybe more. Right in the backyard.

57:06.500 --> 57:08.583
It was really weird, Archie.

57:08.583 --> 57:10.917
Do they go around in big groups like that?

57:11.917 --> 57:13.750
Why the fuck would I know
anything about deer?

57:15.542 --> 57:17.958
If you're so worried about it,
why don't you just ask Mom and Dad?

57:17.958 --> 57:19.792
Like they would even care.

57:22.708 --> 57:24.458
No one cares what I say.

57:27.542 --> 57:28.708
That's probably true.

58:19.375 --> 58:20.292
You going in?

58:21.125 --> 58:22.667
No. You?

58:24.083 --> 58:25.875
Seems like a hassle.

58:25.875 --> 58:28.000
Why? Because of your hair, or...?

58:30.792 --> 58:34.292
More like I don't trust that
one of your kids didn't pee in the pool.

58:35.750 --> 58:36.958
They wouldn't do that.

58:36.958 --> 58:40.000
And yet, we really can't know, can we?

58:51.625 --> 58:53.292
Your daughter watches that show?

58:55.333 --> 58:58.750
"Watch" is far too weak of a word.
More like worships.

59:00.208 --> 59:01.708
Hmm.

59:02.917 --> 59:03.750
What?

59:05.292 --> 59:07.542
Don't get me wrong, I watched it too.

59:07.542 --> 59:12.583
But it's almost... nostalgic
for a time that never existed, you know?

59:19.250 --> 59:21.583
I hope the kids
didn't wander off too far.

59:32.083 --> 59:33.292
Fuck...

59:39.875 --> 59:40.875
Archie.

59:43.083 --> 59:44.292
Archie, look.

59:47.875 --> 59:49.000
Will you please look?

59:52.458 --> 59:53.292
What?

59:56.208 --> 59:57.292
We should go up there.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.667
No. No, fuck that. I'm hungry.
Come on, let's go.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.375
Rose, let's go.

01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:25.208
So...

01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:28.167
You going to tell us
why you're soaking wet?

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:33.792
I fell into the pool.

01:00:34.917 --> 01:00:37.375
You fell into the... pool.

01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:39.625
I tripped over something.

01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:41.458
Yeah, I fell into the pool.

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:44.125
What were you doing near the pool?
I thought you were looking for Rich.

01:00:44.125 --> 01:00:46.875
Do you mind going to my study
and getting me something to wear?

01:00:47.625 --> 01:00:50.458
I'm afraid this is the only
change of clothes I had downstairs.

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.792
I saw it, you know?

01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:06.458
A while ago, before all this happened.

01:01:08.792 --> 01:01:10.167
I looked at the market.

01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:13.208
And I knew something was coming.

01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:17.083
What do you mean?

01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:25.333
In my line of work, you have to understand
the patterns that govern the world.

01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:28.167
You have to learn how to read the curve.

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:32.375
Spend as long as I have doing it,
it can help you see the future.

01:01:32.375 --> 01:01:35.875
It holds steady, it promises harmony.

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:38.958
It inches up or down,
you know that means something.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.500
G.H., why-why are you telling me this?

01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:50.250
Did your neighbor say something to you?

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.792
No, he wasn't home.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:55.625
But he has a satellite phone
I thought could help us.

01:01:56.458 --> 01:02:00.333
I tried to use it. It didn't work
even though it had enough juice.

01:02:01.167 --> 01:02:04.125
Now, the whole point of a satellite phone
is that you always have a signal

01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:06.542
if you have a clear view of the sky,
which I did.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.208
Only reason why it wouldn't work

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:12.583
is if our satellites
got knocked out of commission.

01:02:15.667 --> 01:02:16.708
Our satellites.

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:22.625
You think something happened
to our satellites. The ones in space.

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:25.333
Satellites are networked
to computers down here.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.750
Mm...

01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:34.792
So you think that the hackers or whatever
knocked out our satellites?

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.833
Don't you think you're maybe
getting a little carried away?

01:02:38.833 --> 01:02:40.333
I mean, maybe you just
didn't use the phone right.

01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:43.708
I saw a plane nosedive
out of the sky into the ocean.

01:02:50.292 --> 01:02:51.583
And it wasn't the first.

01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.167
I no longer think that this is just
a couple of teenagers in the Philippines.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
What the fuck?

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:18.250
What the fuck?

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:27.583
Where are my kids?

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:00.667
Mommy.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.333
Where's Dad?

01:05:09.042 --> 01:05:10.000
He'll be back soon.

01:05:11.792 --> 01:05:12.792
Why are you wet?

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:16.958
I should have covered my ears sooner.

01:05:16.958 --> 01:05:18.583
Now my head feels weird.

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:22.667
That's probably normal.
It was really loud.

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:31.000
Was it like a, um, like a-a plane
breaking the sound barrier?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.125
Or whatever that-- a sonic boom.
Was, was that a sonic boom?

01:05:35.125 --> 01:05:37.833
Planes don't usually
break the sound barrier.

01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:40.417
The Concorde doesn't fly anymore.

01:05:40.417 --> 01:05:42.625
Maybe it was a plane
that we don't know about.

01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:46.792
Archie, why don't you go get changed.

01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:49.667
Rose, maybe you should too.

01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:52.542
That's a good idea.

01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:55.208
Why don't you go cuddle up in Mommy's bed
and read that book Dad got you.

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:06.208
We're, um, we're going to be okay, right?

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:08.500
Yeah.

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:19.125
Since you're the one
with the crystal ball, what was that?

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:21.000
Was that a bomb? A missile?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.208
Could have been a power plant explosion.

01:06:23.208 --> 01:06:24.833
We don't know anything for certain yet.

01:06:24.833 --> 01:06:28.833
You seemed pretty certain a minute ago
with your fucking haunting soliloquy.

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:30.083
Nothing's changed.

01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.625
Nothing's changed?

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.500
Everything has changed.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.083
And we're sitting here like...
like I don't know what.

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:43.333
Is-Is this what sitting ducks are?
Ducks sitting and waiting to be shot?

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.792
I meant nothing has changed
in terms of what we do.

01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:49.542
We wait for Clay to come back
and we see what he's learned.

01:06:49.542 --> 01:06:51.792
Should I drive to town and look for him?

01:06:51.792 --> 01:06:53.458
We should fill the bathtubs full of water.

01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:57.542
Is there enough batteries, and Tylenol,
and food, and the generator,

01:06:57.542 --> 01:07:00.000
and one of those hand crank radios,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.042
and a straw that makes it safe
to drink dirty water.

01:07:02.042 --> 01:07:03.917
I think we shouldn't do anything
until Clay comes back.

01:07:03.917 --> 01:07:05.750
What if he's not coming back?

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:07.750
Okay, my dad is right.

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:09.583
We're safe here. We should just sit tight.

01:07:09.583 --> 01:07:10.792
How do you know that we're safe

01:07:10.792 --> 01:07:12.125
when you don't know
what the fuck is happening to us?

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:14.542
Maybe it was like,
what was that? Ten Mile Island?

01:07:14.542 --> 01:07:16.792
There are power plants here, aren't there?

01:07:16.792 --> 01:07:19.292
- Three Mile Island.
- Why are you obsessed with power plants?

01:07:19.292 --> 01:07:21.792
Hey, you're right. We shouldn't speculate.

01:07:21.792 --> 01:07:22.958
Stop saying that!

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:25.917
I just want you to fucking
tell me what you're thinking.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:29.500
There's the blackout
and then you see the planes crashing and...

01:07:31.292 --> 01:07:32.417
What?

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:34.542
What? She's an adult.

01:07:34.542 --> 01:07:37.250
You cannot protect her,
just like you cannot protect me right now.

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:42.167
The satellite phone not working
and then that noise, and then what?

01:07:42.167 --> 01:07:44.458
What happens next in that sequence?

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:46.208
Everything I know I have told you.

01:07:46.208 --> 01:07:47.875
I don't believe you.

01:07:47.875 --> 01:07:50.625
I haven't believed you
since you walked through that front door.

01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:54.167
Golly. I wonder what it is about us
that makes you so mistrustful.

01:07:54.167 --> 01:07:55.125
Ruth...

01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:58.333
You always think you know
what you're talking about, don't you?

01:07:58.333 --> 01:08:00.875
Well, ain't that the pot
calling the kettle black?

01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.458
Ruth.

01:08:33.417 --> 01:08:34.333
He knew.

01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:38.833
At the market in town yesterday,

01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:40.917
there was a guy in the parking lot.

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:44.875
He bought cases of water and canned goods.

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.792
He knew this was going to happen.

01:08:54.083 --> 01:08:55.375
Bearded guy?

01:08:57.083 --> 01:08:58.792
Probably wearing an old Cowboys hat.

01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:01.958
That's Danny.

01:09:01.958 --> 01:09:04.208
He's the contractor
I was telling you about.

01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:07.667
The one who worked on the house.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.250
I wouldn't read into it.

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:11.917
He's a self-proclaimed survivalist.

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:14.917
That shopping list was probably
a typical weekend for him.

01:09:19.042 --> 01:09:20.417
Jesus Christ.

01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:25.083
I'm here. I'm okay, are you okay?
Where are the kids?

01:09:25.083 --> 01:09:27.292
- Everyone's here, everyone's okay.
- Okay.

01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:28.750
What happened? Did you get to town?

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:31.167
Uh... Uh...

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.833
I didn't get far.
And then I heard that noise.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.042
What do you mean?
Where have you been?

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:40.792
What were you doing? I was going crazy.

01:09:40.792 --> 01:09:44.417
I don't know, I-I just started to drive,

01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:48.833
and then I heard that noise,
and I came right back.

01:09:48.833 --> 01:09:52.708
So you didn't see anyone that might
help us figure out what's happening here.

01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:54.375
No, I did not see anyone.

01:09:55.917 --> 01:09:58.000
But I did see something. I saw--

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.292
Um, I, uh--

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:03.792
It was this huge, um, drone.

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:06.958
You know, flying in the middle of nowhere,
dropping off thousands of these.

01:10:06.958 --> 01:10:08.708
I have no idea what it says.

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:21.667
"Death to America."

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:26.208
What?

01:10:27.583 --> 01:10:28.917
"Death to America."

01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:34.750
I mean, I don't know
what the rest of this means,

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:37.500
but this part,
it definitely means "Death to America."

01:10:38.125 --> 01:10:40.000
I remember from a game I was playing.

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:47.792
Nothing about this makes sense.

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:50.333
If they were attacking us,
why would they advertise it like this?

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:53.208
It's not even in English. What's the point
of dropping these things here?

01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:55.125
I'm pretty sure I make that first right,

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.000
then it's a straight shot
to the expressway?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.833
With what we know, the city would be
the worst place for you to go.

01:10:59.833 --> 01:11:02.958
We're not going to the city.
We're going to my sister's in Jersey.

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:05.875
But to get to New Jersey from here,
you have to drive through the city.

01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:09.208
But to be clear, I make a right,
follow signs to the Expressway.

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:12.583
Yes, exactly like how you got here.
But listen to me, please.

01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:15.125
This is dangerous what you're doing,
for you and your family.

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:16.042
Dad.

01:11:16.625 --> 01:11:18.000
Let them go.

01:11:20.625 --> 01:11:23.250
I really appreciate
you taking care of us, I do.

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.458
We have to do what's right for our family.

01:11:26.042 --> 01:11:27.875
This is in everyone's best interest.

01:11:43.458 --> 01:11:44.667
This is for the better.

01:11:47.958 --> 01:11:48.958
For who?

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:51.875
For us.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.667
I don't want to have to agree
with that woman, but she was right.

01:12:01.667 --> 01:12:03.750
And you really
should've told me what you saw.

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.333
Hey, I know what you're thinking,

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:07.833
but I'm certain your mother's plane
wouldn't be flying over here.

01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:09.500
It wasn't the same airline.

01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:14.208
Is she gone?

01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:17.208
Oh, come on now.
Why are you even going there?

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:19.625
I just told you,
it wasn't even the same airline.

01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:21.500
Yeah, but does it feel like she's gone?

01:12:24.792 --> 01:12:26.625
Because it does to me.

01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:35.125
If we hit traffic, at least
we'll be able to talk to people,

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:37.333
see if anyone has information
about what's going on.

01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:39.125
It's crazy we haven't seen anyone.

01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:43.250
I'm sure we will see someone
as soon as we hit the Expressway.

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:46.625
Phones could work
in New Jersey.

01:12:46.625 --> 01:12:49.875
The truth is we don't know anything
that's going on outside of Long Island.

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:52.667
They could have internet,
the phone lines could be okay.

01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:56.583
We'll look back on this one day
and laugh, I guarantee you.

01:12:56.583 --> 01:12:59.250
The vacation from Hell.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.542
Things get funnier with time.
Isn't that what they say?

01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:04.042
I think they say it a little differently.

01:13:04.042 --> 01:13:06.250
But, you know, I know what you mean.

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:09.125
Sirens.

01:13:11.292 --> 01:13:12.833
I thought you were napping, honey.

01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:14.000
I can't.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.250
Why not?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.125
Because of the sirens.

01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:21.667
What is that?

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:45.667
You stay with the kids.
I'm gonna go take a look.

01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:29.125
You know what, you guys, sit--

01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:30.542
Sit tight, okay?

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:33.417
See anyone?

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:36.750
There's nobody here.

01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:46.792
They're all brand new.

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:48.292
What?

01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:53.583
Oh, wow. Hey, someone's coming.

01:14:53.583 --> 01:14:55.000
Yo!

01:15:13.792 --> 01:15:14.833
Clay!

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:18.292
- Clay, get in the car!
- Wait, shouldn't we wait and talk to them?

01:15:18.292 --> 01:15:20.917
- Get in the fucking car right now!
- All right, all right.

01:15:25.125 --> 01:15:27.250
What are you doing?
Shouldn't we flag them down?

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.917
- Maybe they know something.
- There's no one in that car!

01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:36.833
Mom? Mom, on your left, there's a car!
Go, go, go, go!

01:16:25.917 --> 01:16:27.792
What if we went to a shelter?

01:16:29.583 --> 01:16:32.583
Does the military have a bomb shelter
or a base around here?

01:16:32.583 --> 01:16:35.083
I mean, don't they
have to have those things ready for...

01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:37.667
...emergencies like these?

01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:41.250
I don't know where they are.

01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:45.917
Even if I did, you said
all those cars came off the lot.

01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:51.292
If they did that to every dealership,
the main roads are most likely clogged up.

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:54.167
We stay here till we know more.

01:16:54.167 --> 01:16:55.458
How much more do we need to know?

01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:57.375
We're probably
in the middle of a war zone.

01:16:57.375 --> 01:16:59.500
People we know are likely dead.

01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:03.583
Ruth.

01:17:11.125 --> 01:17:11.958
Just--

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.917
We just need to make a plan.

01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:16.333
We can't sit here and do nothing.
We need to go somewhere.

01:17:16.333 --> 01:17:18.750
He's right, Amanda.
It's too dangerous.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:22.833
We stay here tonight,
and then in the morning, maybe--

01:17:22.833 --> 01:17:24.875
- Maybe what?
- Maybe-- I don't know.

01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:35.333
I was so close.

01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:21.833
What are you doing?

01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:25.542
Filling up the tub.

01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:28.083
That's what they say to do for,

01:18:29.083 --> 01:18:31.083
you know, water.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:33.750
Do you vape?

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.542
Not really.

01:18:36.042 --> 01:18:38.958
I mean, is that--
That's like, marijuana?

01:18:38.958 --> 01:18:42.292
I mean, I know they got different kinds
now, like fruit flavors or--

01:18:42.292 --> 01:18:43.417
Like marijuana.

01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:51.292
Have you ever fucked
one of your students?

01:18:55.667 --> 01:18:57.583
I can't believe you just asked me that.

01:18:57.583 --> 01:19:00.792
I mean, is that what I look like to you?
I look like that kind of guy?

01:19:00.792 --> 01:19:04.583
You look like the kind of guy
to whom things come easy.

01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:06.667
Especially women.

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:09.917
Well, I'll take that as a compliment,
I guess. Hmm?

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.833
I always thought of myself
as a sophisticated man.

01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:38.125
Someone who had seen the world
for what it was.

01:19:38.792 --> 01:19:41.167
But I have never seen anything like this.

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:47.250
So now, I wonder if that thing I always
thought about myself was a delusion.

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.208
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

01:19:50.208 --> 01:19:52.750
You dig deep enough,
it's probably all a delusion.

01:19:54.042 --> 01:19:56.000
I mean, take your line of work,
for example.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.750
Imaginary numbers,

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:03.125
moving around imaginary money,
leading to imaginary success.

01:20:03.125 --> 01:20:07.292
Personally, I think my business
is a lot less complicated than all that.

01:20:07.292 --> 01:20:11.083
At its most basic, my work is
and always has been about people.

01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:13.958
- I'm real sorry for you then.
- And why is that?

01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:16.042
Because people are terrible.

01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:19.042
I mean, fuck.
Look at the way I treated you.

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:32.375
And now we are enjoying a drink together.

01:20:48.208 --> 01:20:50.125
I am sorry, by the way.

01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:55.625
For what I said, did, thought,
it doesn't matter.

01:20:55.625 --> 01:20:57.500
I was wrong and I'm sorry.

01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:04.250
Some of my smartest clients
have lost a lot of money

01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:09.583
because they based their choices
on preconceived beliefs instead of truth.

01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:14.875
Seeing the difference is one
of the hardest things a person can do.

01:21:16.042 --> 01:21:19.167
When they don't and you do,
gotta be maddening.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.708
Depending on the person,

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:25.583
I might take a little satisfaction
in watching the market punish them.

01:21:26.917 --> 01:21:29.667
The scary ones, though,
are the ones who don't learn.

01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:32.750
Even after they lose lots,
and I mean lots, of money.

01:21:34.958 --> 01:21:37.458
Nothing frightens me more
than a person unwilling to learn,

01:21:37.458 --> 01:21:38.958
even at their own expense.

01:21:41.583 --> 01:21:43.958
That's a darkness I will never understand.

01:21:55.042 --> 01:21:56.542
The quiet is so noisy.

01:21:58.542 --> 01:22:01.833
It's one of the first things I noticed
when we started spending nights here.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:04.125
Found it hard to sleep.

01:22:05.333 --> 01:22:07.500
Not like at home,
where you hear everything.

01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:11.500
Sirens, traffic, people.

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:14.125
I miss that.

01:22:14.917 --> 01:22:16.583
Which, the sirens or the people?

01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:25.625
I am starting to like you,

01:22:26.333 --> 01:22:28.917
and that is a bold statement
coming from me because...

01:22:30.833 --> 01:22:33.167
I can't remember
the last time I liked anybody.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:37.458
I have to say, I found you
very prickly at the outset,

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:38.958
but you've grown on me.

01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:50.125
Why did you really come here?

01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:53.792
And don't tell me
it's because of your knee.

01:22:54.292 --> 01:22:57.375
That wasn't a lie.
I did have a knee surgery.

01:22:57.375 --> 01:23:00.583
Twisted it up pretty bad
playing ball down at the Y.

01:23:00.583 --> 01:23:02.542
But it's not why you came here.

01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:13.042
Why I came here involves something
that happened to me a few years back.

01:23:15.917 --> 01:23:19.292
One of my clients invited me
and my wife to a private event.

01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:21.333
My client, he...

01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:23.375
Well.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.375
I won't say his name,
but you'd recognize it though.

01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:31.500
- Is he a celebrity?
- Oh, no. Nothing like that.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.625
But in the business world,
he's one of the biggest out there.

01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:39.292
He deals mostly in defense contracting.

01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:43.458
I'm talking hush-hush,
top-secret money from the Pentagon.

01:23:43.458 --> 01:23:46.167
Perhaps the most powerful person
I've ever had a meal with.

01:23:46.167 --> 01:23:50.000
Anyway, we're at this soiree at his house.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.167
It's getting late.
My wife, she wants to go.

01:23:53.167 --> 01:23:57.167
But he and I are just having a blast,
and he doesn't want the night to end.

01:23:57.167 --> 01:23:59.583
After a few more glares,

01:23:59.583 --> 01:24:03.292
my wife agrees to take a cab
and I'll come home after.

01:24:03.292 --> 01:24:05.708
Mm, I bet she was real happy about that.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:07.125
Mm-hmm.

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:12.083
So, we're having a few more drinks,
getting really sauced, and at one point,

01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:16.000
I don't think he could stand
and I was pretty wobbly, myself.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.125
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:22.833
So he takes me to his study.

01:24:22.833 --> 01:24:24.667
Smoke a few cigars

01:24:24.667 --> 01:24:28.958
and we're sort of flying high,
laughing at almost everything.

01:24:28.958 --> 01:24:31.375
Eventually he starts in
on how much he likes me,

01:24:31.375 --> 01:24:35.083
and how he wishes he could invite me
on this trip he's about to go on.

01:24:35.667 --> 01:24:38.000
What kind of trip? Where is he going?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.208
That's exactly what I asked.

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:42.875
Then he...

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:45.458
turns to me,

01:24:45.458 --> 01:24:46.792
serious face.

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:49.958
And he says...

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:52.167
"Oh, you know,

01:24:52.167 --> 01:24:53.792
"just my annual meeting

01:24:53.792 --> 01:24:56.750
with the rest of the evil cabal
that runs the world."

01:25:02.125 --> 01:25:04.875
He was the kind of guy
that was always known for jokes like that.

01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:07.958
Again, if I told you his name,
you would understand.

01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:10.625
Well, I just have
to take your word for it.

01:25:10.625 --> 01:25:13.792
And now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna top off my wine.

01:25:15.792 --> 01:25:19.042
Then yesterday,
before the symphony,

01:25:19.042 --> 01:25:20.625
my friend calls me up.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.167
No scheduled appointment,
like he usually does.

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:27.833
Just calls me out of the blue

01:25:27.833 --> 01:25:30.208
and wants me to move around
some of his money.

01:25:31.833 --> 01:25:34.292
And we're talking some big numbers,
even for him.

01:25:36.208 --> 01:25:39.875
And as we're getting off the phone,
I asked if he wanted to grab a drink.

01:25:39.875 --> 01:25:42.167
He tells me he's going away for a while.

01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:44.917
And I joke back to him,

01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:48.333
"Oh, yeah? You hanging
with your evil cabal this weekend?

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:50.458
I thought that was only
during the winter solstice."

01:25:54.708 --> 01:25:56.083
But he doesn't laugh.

01:25:57.667 --> 01:26:00.292
And he always laughs, even with bad jokes.

01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:03.292
All he said was...

01:26:04.917 --> 01:26:06.208
"Take care of yourself."

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.750
Almost as if he felt sorry for me.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:15.000
Ever since, I haven't been
able to get it out of my head.

01:26:22.542 --> 01:26:23.833
Are you saying that--

01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:27.833
Are you thinking that your friend
is somehow behind what's happening here?

01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:29.083
No, nothing like that.

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:32.500
A conspiracy theory about a shadowy
group of people running the world

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.750
is far too lazy of an explanation.

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.000
Especially when the truth
is much scarier.

01:26:40.167 --> 01:26:41.667
What is the truth?

01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:44.375
No one is in control.

01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:46.333
No one is pulling the strings.

01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:49.292
Sure, there are those like my friend

01:26:49.292 --> 01:26:53.375
who might have the right kind of access
to the right kind of information.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:56.583
But when events like this
happen in the world,

01:26:56.583 --> 01:27:00.417
the best, even the most powerful
people can hope for

01:27:00.417 --> 01:27:02.250
is a heads up.

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:12.292
Sorry, this...

01:27:13.833 --> 01:27:15.750
Guess this story's kind of a buzzkill.

01:27:18.542 --> 01:27:21.208
Changed my mind.
I don't think I like you anymore.

01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:30.333
Come on.

01:27:32.083 --> 01:27:32.958
Let's go.

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:34.917
Where are we going?

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:36.458
I'm gonna win you over again.

01:27:41.125 --> 01:27:42.417
I see you, Rose.

01:27:47.375 --> 01:27:48.542
What do you want?

01:27:50.833 --> 01:27:53.792
I'm never going to find out what happens
to Ross and Rachel, am I?

01:27:53.792 --> 01:27:55.625
You're still on this shit?

01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:57.083
Who gives a fuck?

01:27:57.083 --> 01:27:59.917
Well, I do. Obviously.

01:27:59.917 --> 01:28:02.042
Why do you care so much
about that show anyway?

01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:06.833
They make me happy.

01:28:08.042 --> 01:28:10.333
I really need that right now. Don't you?

01:28:17.833 --> 01:28:20.125
If there's any hope left
in this fucked up world,

01:28:20.125 --> 01:28:22.917
I wanna at least find out
how things turn out for them.

01:28:28.417 --> 01:28:29.625
I care about them.

01:28:32.792 --> 01:28:33.917
Maybe you shouldn't.

01:28:35.042 --> 01:28:36.083
I'm just saying.

01:28:36.958 --> 01:28:39.750
You're probably right,
the way things are going

01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:42.042
you're not gonna see
that show ever again.

01:28:43.125 --> 01:28:45.958
So if I were you,
I'd find something else to care about.

01:28:52.625 --> 01:28:55.042
It's weird, we're not hearing
any cicadas tonight.

01:28:58.417 --> 01:28:59.458
I got lost today.

01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:03.292
When I went out this morning.

01:29:05.375 --> 01:29:06.875
What do you mean you got lost?

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:08.667
Well,

01:29:08.667 --> 01:29:10.417
I thought I knew where I was going

01:29:10.417 --> 01:29:13.833
but then there were all these streets
that didn't have any signs anywhere.

01:29:14.458 --> 01:29:16.917
So I just drove around.

01:29:17.833 --> 01:29:19.542
Then I drove around some more.

01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:25.667
And then, you know, I turn around,
and then I got just completely lost,

01:29:25.667 --> 01:29:28.542
and I have no idea how I found
my way back here, to be honest.

01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:35.208
But I did see someone.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.708
A woman.

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:43.208
On the road.

01:29:45.042 --> 01:29:48.250
She waved me down and, um,

01:29:48.875 --> 01:29:50.542
she was speaking Spanish.

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:53.250
She was just standing there

01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:55.958
by the side of the road
in the middle of nowhere.

01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:57.042
And I...

01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:00.250
I left her.

01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:03.917
She needed help.

01:30:05.417 --> 01:30:06.417
And I left her.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.583
Well, is there anything else
that you're keeping from us?

01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:28.042
Since you're opening up, that is.

01:30:31.458 --> 01:30:35.958
Well, we didn't tell you before
that we saw an oil tanker ground.

01:30:35.958 --> 01:30:38.083
Like, right up on the beach.

01:30:38.083 --> 01:30:39.500
An oil tanker?

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.917
Yeah, it's like a really big boat.

01:30:42.917 --> 01:30:44.250
You know, it's red.

01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:47.917
I mean, well,
I don't think that they're all red,

01:30:47.917 --> 01:30:51.833
but this one was,
and it came right up on the beach.

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.250
Why didn't you tell us?

01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:57.542
Well, I think at the time
we were both scared, you know?

01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:01.542
About what it could mean.

01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:04.042
Well, what could it mean?

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:06.500
Well, if we were being attacked,

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:10.333
which I know sounds weird to say,
but oil is something

01:31:10.333 --> 01:31:11.750
that you would want a lot of

01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:13.750
if, you know,
we're going to defend ourselves.

01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:15.792
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.

01:31:15.792 --> 01:31:18.042
I really think we're gonna be all right.

01:31:18.042 --> 01:31:20.875
You know, I mean,
in the end, I really do.

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.833
I mean, even if it is like, an invasion.

01:31:22.833 --> 01:31:23.750
An invasion?

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:25.458
Well, or an occupation?

01:31:25.458 --> 01:31:28.000
Okay, dude, you know what?
I know that you mean well,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.750
but your word choices are, like,
freaking me the fuck out.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
What was that?

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:57.375
Those are... flamingos.

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:00.417
Those are flamingos?

01:32:02.042 --> 01:32:03.583
Those are flamingos.

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:08.292
Why?

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:13.833
Wow, this is an impressive collection.

01:32:15.792 --> 01:32:16.958
You like jazz?

01:32:18.542 --> 01:32:20.417
You want to listen to jazz?

01:32:20.417 --> 01:32:22.042
Sure, why not?

01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:25.042
Because I thought
we were going to have some fun.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.333
Let's have something we could dance to.

01:32:28.333 --> 01:32:30.167
You can dance to jazz.

01:32:30.167 --> 01:32:32.250
In fact, when I bought
my first record, that was--

01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:34.417
Oh, please
not another one of your stories.

01:32:34.417 --> 01:32:38.083
They end up leaving me severely disturbed.
Wait. What are these records?

01:32:38.083 --> 01:32:40.417
Don't look over there.
Those are my daughter's records.

01:32:40.417 --> 01:32:43.792
She had a DJ phase in college.

01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:47.292
Now this looks like something
a lady can properly dance to.

01:32:47.292 --> 01:32:50.542
Oh, come on.
That's not what I brought you in here for.

01:32:54.625 --> 01:32:57.000
You said you wanted to win me over.

01:32:57.583 --> 01:32:58.792

01:36:51.208 --> 01:36:52.708
What are you still doing up?

01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:58.375
I keep thinking about
this one <i>West Wing</i> episode.

01:36:59.042 --> 01:37:01.125
There's this story,
someone tells the president--

01:37:01.125 --> 01:37:03.125
You watched <i>The West Wing?</i>

01:37:03.708 --> 01:37:05.917
Only the Aaron Sorkin seasons.

01:37:07.333 --> 01:37:12.500
Anyway, the story was about a man
who lived by the river.

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:15.750
And he hears on the radio
that the river is going to flood the town

01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:17.458
and everyone should leave.

01:37:17.458 --> 01:37:22.125
But the man doesn't go anywhere
because he prays every day.

01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:24.500
He knows that God loves him
and will save him.

01:37:25.083 --> 01:37:27.208
But then the flood actually happens.

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:30.000
And this guy in a rowboat sees the man

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.917
and says,
"Hey, come on, I can save you."

01:37:32.917 --> 01:37:35.042
But the man tells him
he isn't going anywhere.

01:37:35.708 --> 01:37:39.833
Then the helicopter comes flying by,
and the pilot lowers the ladder,

01:37:39.833 --> 01:37:42.292
but the man tells him
he isn't going anywhere.

01:37:43.042 --> 01:37:45.542
After that, the man drowns in the flood.

01:37:45.542 --> 01:37:49.417
And so he goes up to heaven
and he's really angry at God,

01:37:50.208 --> 01:37:52.833
and he tells him,
"I prayed to you every day.

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:55.667
I thought you loved me.
Why didn't you save me?"

01:37:56.292 --> 01:37:57.792
And God says,

01:37:57.792 --> 01:37:59.625
"I sent you a radio report,

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.625
a rowboat and a helicopter.

01:38:02.625 --> 01:38:04.667
What more do you want?"

01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:08.042
What's this about, Rose?

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.958
I think I'm done waiting.

01:38:51.042 --> 01:38:52.375
- Dad?
- Hmm?

01:38:52.375 --> 01:38:54.167
Will you sleep in the bed with me?

01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:55.750
Not sure.

01:38:57.625 --> 01:39:00.583
The bed's not big,
and I don't mind sleeping on the floor.

01:39:00.583 --> 01:39:03.000
- It's sometimes good for my back.
- I'm scared.

01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:10.750
It's just us now, isn't it?

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.083
What do you mean by that?

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.000
What I mean is,

01:39:18.667 --> 01:39:19.792
if the shit goes down,

01:39:19.792 --> 01:39:22.583
do you trust these people
that are in our house?

01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:25.667
We already know the wife has no chill.

01:39:25.667 --> 01:39:28.458
That boy was sneaking
pictures of me by the pool.

01:39:28.458 --> 01:39:31.458
That little girl keeps staring
into the woods like Donnie Darko,

01:39:31.458 --> 01:39:33.875
and I'm pretty sure
the husband wants to fuck me.

01:39:35.917 --> 01:39:37.000
How do you know that?

01:39:38.042 --> 01:39:40.042
He's not actually going to do anything,
he's not "that guy."

01:39:40.042 --> 01:39:42.583
But did he want to? Abso-fucking-lutely.

01:39:43.667 --> 01:39:46.000
My point remains, I don't trust them.

01:39:57.625 --> 01:40:01.125
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you,
if that's what you're asking.

01:40:03.042 --> 01:40:07.208
I'm asking for you to remember
that if the world falls apart,

01:40:07.208 --> 01:40:10.042
trust should not be
doled out easily to anyone,

01:40:10.042 --> 01:40:11.875
especially white people.

01:40:12.583 --> 01:40:14.542
Even mom would agree with me on that.

01:40:18.125 --> 01:40:19.125
I got it.

01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:22.583
Do you?

01:40:23.708 --> 01:40:25.833
Because we're sleeping
in the basement of our own house

01:40:25.833 --> 01:40:27.458
for the second night in a row.

01:40:28.958 --> 01:40:32.375
Just what exactly was the point
of letting them back into the house?

01:40:34.167 --> 01:40:35.708
It was the right thing to do.

01:40:37.625 --> 01:40:41.208
And that right there.
That's what's going to fuck us in the end.

01:41:17.833 --> 01:41:18.750
Drink up.

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:30.625
Where's Rosie?

01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:33.000
I don't know. She got up before us.

01:41:35.417 --> 01:41:37.833
I'm gonna have a look around.
You should get up.

01:41:45.625 --> 01:41:47.042
How are you feeling, baby?

01:41:48.292 --> 01:41:49.125
Come on.

01:41:50.042 --> 01:41:51.667
I know you're sleepy
but I need you to get up

01:41:51.667 --> 01:41:54.375
so I can get a look at you
and take your temperature.

01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:56.083
You were pretty warm last night.

01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:59.417
Well, you're not so warm now.

01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:01.375
Yay.

01:42:01.917 --> 01:42:03.208
Does your throat hurt?

01:42:04.042 --> 01:42:05.542
- No.
- Good.

01:42:14.417 --> 01:42:17.125
What is that? Blood, is that blood?

01:42:21.917 --> 01:42:22.750
What are you--

01:42:24.167 --> 01:42:25.000
What are you--

01:42:25.708 --> 01:42:27.083
What are you fucking doing?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.125
What the fuck?
Are those your teeth?

01:42:37.917 --> 01:42:38.833
Archie.

01:42:41.625 --> 01:42:43.542
Stop doing that. Clay!

01:42:50.417 --> 01:42:51.292
My teeth.

01:42:51.917 --> 01:42:52.750
Clay!

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:54.042
What's happening to me?

01:42:54.042 --> 01:42:54.958
Clay!

01:42:54.958 --> 01:42:56.125
Is everything okay?

01:42:56.667 --> 01:42:59.375
- Something's wrong with Archie.
- What is it? What the fuck?

01:42:59.375 --> 01:43:02.667
- That's exactly what I said.
- My teeth just, they felt weird.

01:43:02.667 --> 01:43:04.583
And I touched them,
and they just they fell out.

01:43:04.583 --> 01:43:06.750
He was a little warm last night
but this, I don't know.

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:09.542
Okay, all right.
Well you-- you're okay.

01:43:09.542 --> 01:43:11.042
I don't feel okay.

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:19.542
How are you feeling?

01:43:22.542 --> 01:43:24.667
Besides your teeth falling out, I mean.

01:43:24.667 --> 01:43:26.792
What kind of question is that?
He's obviously sick.

01:43:26.792 --> 01:43:30.417
I'm not sick, Mom. My teeth just fell out.

01:43:32.167 --> 01:43:33.750
Maybe it was the bug that bit me.
I don't know.

01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:34.667
What bug?

01:43:35.667 --> 01:43:37.917
A bug bit me yesterday in the woods.

01:43:37.917 --> 01:43:39.250
That must be it, then.

01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:43.417
Probably just a tick, Lyme disease.
I've seen stranger symptoms.

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:44.833
Stranger than this?

01:43:44.833 --> 01:43:46.208
He needs to go to the emergency room.

01:43:46.208 --> 01:43:47.458
We need to go to the hospital.

01:43:47.458 --> 01:43:50.625
We can't. The expressway's
the only way out of town.

01:43:50.625 --> 01:43:53.458
Besides, if the roads are jammed,
no one would be there to help us anyway.

01:43:53.458 --> 01:43:56.750
Well, we have to do something.
Archie needs to see a doctor.

01:43:57.333 --> 01:43:59.458
I can't believe this is happening.

01:43:59.458 --> 01:44:01.625
I can't believe this is happening.

01:44:05.083 --> 01:44:08.042
We'll go to my contractor's house.
He's not that far from here.

01:44:08.042 --> 01:44:10.958
You said you saw him
stocking up on supplies?

01:44:10.958 --> 01:44:12.833
If I know Danny,
he's prepared for anything.

01:44:12.833 --> 01:44:14.167
He might have something useful.

01:44:14.167 --> 01:44:15.917
Antibiotics, medicine.

01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:17.875
Danny'll know what to do.

01:44:19.125 --> 01:44:19.958
Hey.

01:44:20.708 --> 01:44:23.542
I promise you,
I'll get your son some help.

01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:26.167
Where's Rose?

01:44:28.375 --> 01:44:29.458
I couldn't find her.

01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:32.167
What? What does that mean?

01:44:32.167 --> 01:44:34.292
I looked all over the house.
She's not here.

01:44:34.292 --> 01:44:36.458
- She's not in the backyard.
- I'll look downstairs.

01:44:36.458 --> 01:44:38.125
She's probably exploring the house.

01:44:38.125 --> 01:44:40.125
She might be playing outside.
I'll look out for her.

01:44:40.125 --> 01:44:41.750
I looked there
but feel free to check again.

01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:43.000
I don't understand.
Where is she?

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.958
- She has to be here somewhere.
- No, she's not!

01:44:44.958 --> 01:44:48.208
I'm telling you, I have
looked everywhere and she's not here.

01:44:48.208 --> 01:44:51.625
- Well, she should be in the garage.
- I already looked in the garage.

01:44:51.625 --> 01:44:53.750
Okay. Where the fuck
haven't you looked, Clay?

01:44:55.167 --> 01:44:56.583
She's not down there.

01:44:56.583 --> 01:44:58.583
Okay, this is insane. Where is she?

01:44:58.583 --> 01:44:59.667
She wasn't outside,

01:44:59.667 --> 01:45:02.125
but I think she may have taken
one of the bikes from the garage.

01:45:02.125 --> 01:45:03.917
Took one of the bikes?
Where would she go?

01:45:03.917 --> 01:45:05.875
Do you have any idea
where your sister might be, bud?

01:45:06.458 --> 01:45:07.417
I don't know.

01:45:07.417 --> 01:45:10.208
Um, we were out
by the shed yesterday, so--

01:45:10.208 --> 01:45:11.542
The shed? What shed?

01:45:11.542 --> 01:45:13.000
The-- the shed.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.042
Um, she-- she saw some deer
and she wanted to go look for them.

01:45:16.042 --> 01:45:18.875
- So maybe there. I don't know.
- Okay, I'm going.

01:45:21.708 --> 01:45:24.125
- Archie, you all right?

01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:26.667
- Are you all right--

01:45:26.667 --> 01:45:28.542
-  He needs help now.
-  Yeah, okay.

01:45:28.542 --> 01:45:30.583
- Okay, I got you.
-  I'm coming with you.

01:45:30.583 --> 01:45:32.000
No, it's not safe.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.042
Stay here with Amanda. Find Rose.

01:45:34.042 --> 01:45:36.292
No. What?
You can't leave me here by myself.

01:45:36.292 --> 01:45:38.125
- It'll be okay.
- Dad, we talked about this.

01:45:38.125 --> 01:45:39.792
You cannot leave me here by myself.

01:45:39.792 --> 01:45:42.958
- He's sick, don't you see that?
- Dad, you will never come back.

01:45:42.958 --> 01:45:45.000
Don't you see that something is happening?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.333
It is happening right now.

01:45:46.333 --> 01:45:49.292
Whatever it is, it's happening to Archie,
it's happening to all of us.

01:45:49.292 --> 01:45:51.917
You can't leave.
The world could be ending out there.

01:45:51.917 --> 01:45:53.375
That's why I want you here.

01:45:54.458 --> 01:45:55.542
Take out your phone.

01:45:56.792 --> 01:45:58.375
Come on, take it out.

01:45:58.375 --> 01:45:59.833
Set a timer, one hour.

01:46:00.667 --> 01:46:01.583
I'll be back.

01:46:02.833 --> 01:46:03.833
It won't work.

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:05.500
It won't work out.

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.208
It will, there's no choice.

01:46:07.208 --> 01:46:09.958
Look, I'll be back for you
before this goes off.

01:46:19.542 --> 01:46:22.708
One hour.
That's what you get. You've promised.

01:46:32.167 --> 01:46:35.833
Rose? Rose!

01:46:35.833 --> 01:46:40.042
Rosie! Rose!

01:46:57.542 --> 01:46:59.500
This is a nightmare.

01:47:00.083 --> 01:47:01.750
This is a goddamn nightmare.

01:47:03.625 --> 01:47:06.750
Where would Rose have gone?
Why would she leave?

01:47:07.333 --> 01:47:09.875
She said she was done waiting.
What did she mean?

01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:15.833
What if we just went back to the house
and we waited for my dad to get back?

01:47:16.417 --> 01:47:17.417
And then what?

01:47:18.167 --> 01:47:19.625
He'll find Rose?

01:47:19.625 --> 01:47:21.792
I don't know, but he will help us.

01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:24.708
I just want to know
what the fuck is happening.

01:47:24.708 --> 01:47:26.542
I want to know what the fuck is the plan.

01:47:26.542 --> 01:47:30.750
I want to know that we can find my kid
and then get in your fucking expensive car

01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:33.750
and drive to an actual hospital,
find a doctor who will tell me

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:36.583
that my baby is okay,
that we're all gonna be okay,

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:38.750
and then we can just
all go back to our house.

01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:40.125
What if that's not possible?

01:47:40.125 --> 01:47:44.708
I want to get the fuck away from here,
and you, and whatever is happening.

01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:46.125
It's happening to all of us.

01:47:46.125 --> 01:47:48.167
I know that it is happening to all of us!

01:47:48.167 --> 01:47:49.708
Stop yelling at me!

01:47:59.667 --> 01:48:00.667
You don't care.

01:48:03.417 --> 01:48:04.875
You don't care that I'm here.

01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:10.250
And my mom is probably
at the bottom of some ocean.

01:48:14.417 --> 01:48:17.208
I don't have anyone else in my life.

01:48:18.375 --> 01:48:22.875
I have nothing to go home to but them.
Do you understand that?

01:48:24.833 --> 01:48:28.042
And I need my mom more than ever.

01:48:30.042 --> 01:48:32.333
And I will probably never see her again.

01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.167
I care, I do.

01:48:47.125 --> 01:48:50.250
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do about that, but I do care.

01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:54.875
Why are you like this?

01:48:58.417 --> 01:49:01.792
What do you get
out of being so angry all the time?

01:49:13.417 --> 01:49:18.083
Every day, all day, my job--
my whole job is to...

01:49:19.042 --> 01:49:22.917
...understand people well enough
so that I know how to lie to them,

01:49:22.917 --> 01:49:25.750
so I can sell them things
they don't really want.

01:49:26.625 --> 01:49:28.708
And when you study people like that,

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:32.458
when you really see the way
they treat each other, well...

01:49:33.875 --> 01:49:34.792
You're no dummy.

01:49:35.917 --> 01:49:39.917
You see what they do, and they do it
without even thinking about it.

01:49:39.917 --> 01:49:44.000
Fuck. I did it to you and your dad,
and I don't even really know why.

01:49:45.333 --> 01:49:47.625
We fuck each other over

01:49:47.625 --> 01:49:50.375
all the time,
without even realizing it.

01:49:50.375 --> 01:49:55.083
We fuck every living thing on this planet
over and think it'll be fine

01:49:55.083 --> 01:49:59.667
because we use paper straws
and order the free range chicken.

01:50:00.625 --> 01:50:05.250
And the sick thing is, I think deep down
we know we're not fooling anyone.

01:50:05.250 --> 01:50:07.292
I think we know we're living a lie.

01:50:07.292 --> 01:50:09.875
An agreed upon mass delusion

01:50:09.875 --> 01:50:13.667
to help us ignore and keep ignoring
how awful we really are.

01:50:21.417 --> 01:50:25.250
I'm not down with most of the things
that you do and say, but...

01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:30.375
...this is the part of the Venn diagram
where we overlap.

01:50:32.042 --> 01:50:34.500
I agree with everything you just said.

01:50:36.417 --> 01:50:41.000
But as awful as people might be...

01:50:43.375 --> 01:50:46.375
...nothing's gonna change the fact
that we are all we've got.

01:50:51.125 --> 01:50:52.708
I don't want to be this way.

01:51:00.542 --> 01:51:02.375
I hate being terrible like this.

01:51:04.667 --> 01:51:07.333
And I know I say I hate people, but I...

01:51:07.333 --> 01:51:09.958
I'd do anything to have them back.

01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:13.292
Hey, Dad.

01:52:13.875 --> 01:52:15.875
Do you think Taylor's okay?

01:52:16.708 --> 01:52:17.542
Who?

01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:24.875
Archie, you stay here.

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:27.417
Let's go.

01:52:45.208 --> 01:52:46.167
George.

01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:50.125
Danny. Sorry to bother you
at home like this.

01:52:50.125 --> 01:52:52.500
I'm gonna need you and your comrade
to step off the porch

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:53.917
and stand by your vehicle.

01:52:55.292 --> 01:52:56.375
What?

01:52:56.375 --> 01:52:58.833
Off the porch and by your vehicle.

01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:22.000
What can I do for you?

01:53:27.333 --> 01:53:28.792
We're just checking on you.

01:53:30.042 --> 01:53:32.167
Seeing if you're here, if you're okay.

01:53:33.542 --> 01:53:36.125
If you heard anything
about what's going on.

01:53:36.125 --> 01:53:37.625
Yeah, I'm Clay.

01:53:37.625 --> 01:53:41.167
My family rented G.H.'s--
George's home, you know.

01:53:41.167 --> 01:53:42.708
We're from the city.

01:53:42.708 --> 01:53:44.958
Well, that's a lucky break
for your family.

01:53:44.958 --> 01:53:47.542
Imagine what a shit show
the city must be right now.

01:53:48.583 --> 01:53:51.542
I got to be honest with you,
I'm surprised you guys are even out.

01:53:52.417 --> 01:53:54.958
We came out here
because my son needs help.

01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:58.042
He's vomiting. He's--

01:53:58.042 --> 01:54:01.125
He's lost his teeth.
They just fell out. Can't explain it.

01:54:01.125 --> 01:54:03.167
Oh. His teeth, huh?

01:54:04.458 --> 01:54:07.042
Well, it's gotta have something
to do with that noise.

01:54:10.125 --> 01:54:11.875
You know something about the noise?

01:54:11.875 --> 01:54:16.708
Well, it's not all that dissimilar
to what happened in Cuba a while back.

01:54:16.708 --> 01:54:19.667
Microwave weapons, they call it,
produces a kind of radiation

01:54:19.667 --> 01:54:21.958
that can be beamed out through sound.

01:54:22.833 --> 01:54:25.792
Some people lost their teeth there too.

01:54:25.792 --> 01:54:28.125
Outside of that,
the only thing I know for sure is

01:54:28.125 --> 01:54:30.625
there's not a lot of information
getting out, so...

01:54:32.417 --> 01:54:33.625
I assume it's a war.

01:54:35.542 --> 01:54:37.167
The beginning of one, anyways.

01:54:37.167 --> 01:54:38.958
They've been saying there was chatter.

01:54:38.958 --> 01:54:41.250
This has to be
what they were chattering about.

01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:43.667
Chatter, what do you mean, "chatter"?

01:54:45.250 --> 01:54:47.917
You got to read the papers
deeper than page one.

01:54:48.708 --> 01:54:52.125
The Russians recalled
their staff from Washington.

01:54:52.125 --> 01:54:53.792
Did you even notice that?

01:54:53.792 --> 01:54:56.958
Something is afoot.
Now, what that is exactly, I don't know.

01:54:56.958 --> 01:54:59.042
Maybe this is as much
as we're ever going to know.

01:54:59.042 --> 01:55:03.042
Maybe we just need to sit tight, be safe.

01:55:04.542 --> 01:55:06.500
Pray. Whatever works for you.

01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:10.583
Well, Danny.

01:55:12.333 --> 01:55:14.375
It's like Clay said, his son isn't well.

01:55:15.458 --> 01:55:17.708
We're gonna need more than just prayers.

01:55:17.708 --> 01:55:20.083
And knowing how primed you are
for these kind of situations,

01:55:20.083 --> 01:55:22.542
we're thinking you might have
some medicine that'd be able to help him.

01:55:22.542 --> 01:55:24.875
What I got isn't your business.

01:55:28.583 --> 01:55:29.458
Danny.

01:55:30.042 --> 01:55:32.167
Come on now, it's me.
We know each other.

01:55:33.375 --> 01:55:34.375
We're friends.

01:55:34.375 --> 01:55:38.542
That's the old way, George.
You're not thinking clearly.

01:55:38.542 --> 01:55:40.417
Danny, what are you saying?

01:55:40.417 --> 01:55:42.792
You're telling this man
not to take care of his son?

01:55:42.792 --> 01:55:44.375
Nothing makes
a whole lot of sense right now.

01:55:44.375 --> 01:55:47.542
When the world doesn't make any sense,
I can still do what's rational,

01:55:47.542 --> 01:55:49.250
which is protect my own.

01:55:50.125 --> 01:55:52.958
What you do is your business.

01:55:52.958 --> 01:55:56.167
I thought I was doing the right thing
by bringing them here.

01:55:56.167 --> 01:55:58.417
Now if you have some medicine
that can help him--

01:55:58.417 --> 01:56:00.000
We can pay.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.458
Um, a-- a--

01:56:02.458 --> 01:56:04.792
Say, a thousand dollars?

01:56:04.792 --> 01:56:07.375
Cash might not mean much
if the government falls.

01:56:07.375 --> 01:56:10.833
Well, the whole network's down.
My credit cards aren't going to work.

01:56:10.833 --> 01:56:13.625
There's no Venmo or ApplePay.

01:56:13.625 --> 01:56:16.917
I mean, cash might be the only thing
that means something.

01:56:19.042 --> 01:56:22.458
My son's really sick.
He needs your help. He's 16 years old.

01:56:30.833 --> 01:56:32.000
Nothing's here.

01:56:50.125 --> 01:56:51.125
Rosie.

01:56:54.625 --> 01:56:56.833
You're in a difficult position.

01:56:56.833 --> 01:56:58.042
I get it.

01:56:58.625 --> 01:57:01.083
I would do anything I had to
for my family.

01:57:01.083 --> 01:57:02.583
So that's what I'm doing.

01:57:02.583 --> 01:57:05.458
I'm locking the doors.
I'm waiting, I'm watching,

01:57:05.458 --> 01:57:07.500
I'm getting out my gun.

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:10.458
Other than that,
I don't have any answers for you.

01:57:14.083 --> 01:57:15.708
Ruth, it's bike tracks--

01:57:22.417 --> 01:57:25.333
I'm going to go back inside my house now.

01:57:25.333 --> 01:57:28.333
I'm gonna say goodbye and good luck.

01:57:28.333 --> 01:57:30.458
You come out again,
you're welcome to stop by,

01:57:30.458 --> 01:57:33.292
but I can't offer you
much more than conversation.

01:57:34.292 --> 01:57:37.083
I suggest you try
your neighbors, the Thornes.

01:57:37.083 --> 01:57:38.833
They did a basement conversion

01:57:38.833 --> 01:57:41.333
on the down-low a while back,
no permits or nothing.

01:57:41.333 --> 01:57:43.958
A buddy of mine worked on it.
He wouldn't even show me the plans.

01:57:43.958 --> 01:57:45.417
Now, you ask me?

01:57:45.417 --> 01:57:48.583
That's rich asshole talk
for doomsday bunker.

01:57:48.583 --> 01:57:51.083
Come on, Danny.
You can't desert us like this.

01:57:53.333 --> 01:57:57.833
Haven't you been picking up
on what's going on out there, George?

01:57:58.417 --> 01:58:00.083
We've all been deserted.

01:58:29.958 --> 01:58:31.458
<i>All due respect.</i>

01:58:32.542 --> 01:58:35.167
I would like all of you
off of my property.

01:58:36.458 --> 01:58:37.458
Now.

01:58:51.583 --> 01:58:54.042
We're not going anywhere
till you give us what we need.

01:59:10.667 --> 01:59:12.958
What the fuck
is going on right now?

01:59:17.458 --> 01:59:19.667
I promised this boy's mother
I'd get him some help.

01:59:19.667 --> 01:59:21.833
The only thing
you're helping him to is a quick death

01:59:21.833 --> 01:59:24.500
- unless you lower your weapons.
- G.H., put the gun down.

01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:27.208
- We'll find another way to the hospital.
- There is no other way!

01:59:27.208 --> 01:59:28.625
Besides, he's not gonna shoot us.

01:59:28.625 --> 01:59:30.833
Uh... It sounds like he's gonna shoot us.

01:59:30.833 --> 01:59:32.917
- I'm telling you he's bluffing.
- The fuck I am.

01:59:41.417 --> 01:59:43.042
Hold-- Hold on!
Hold on!

01:59:43.042 --> 01:59:44.500
- Clay, get out of the way!
- Dad!

01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.167
I'm trying to reason with him!

01:59:53.625 --> 01:59:55.333
The only way this ends

01:59:55.333 --> 01:59:58.083
is if you get back in your vehicle
and drive away now.

01:59:58.083 --> 02:00:01.042
Drive away to what?
All the roads are blocked.

02:00:01.042 --> 02:00:03.583
We're in the middle of God-knows-where.
There's no one else around.

02:00:03.583 --> 02:00:06.833
I have no idea
what I am supposed to do right now.

02:00:06.833 --> 02:00:10.833
I can barely do anything
without my cell phone and my GPS.

02:00:10.833 --> 02:00:13.542
I am a useless man.

02:00:14.792 --> 02:00:16.833
But my son is sick.

02:00:17.917 --> 02:00:20.667
And my daughter is missing.

02:00:21.833 --> 02:00:23.583
And I don't know what to do.

02:00:24.917 --> 02:00:28.542
But you are a very prepared man.

02:00:28.542 --> 02:00:29.750
Fuck yeah, I am.

02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:31.417
That's right, that's why we came to you,

02:00:31.417 --> 02:00:33.417
because you're the only one
who can help my son.

02:00:33.417 --> 02:00:36.417
- Not my problem.
- No, you're right. It's not.

02:00:36.417 --> 02:00:39.708
But it's like you said, right?

02:00:39.708 --> 02:00:43.042
What would you do if it was your family?
That's what I'm doing.

02:00:43.042 --> 02:00:44.875
It's the only thing I can do.

02:00:45.458 --> 02:00:47.333
I am begging you.

02:00:47.333 --> 02:00:48.333
Please.

02:00:49.458 --> 02:00:51.375
Please help my son.

02:01:33.375 --> 02:01:37.500
I guess an old fashioned barter system
was to be expected at some point.

02:01:38.583 --> 02:01:41.292
It's still cash,
so it's not really a barter system.

02:01:41.292 --> 02:01:43.792
Hey, I got another tidbit for you.

02:01:43.792 --> 02:01:45.583
Free of charge, if you want it.

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:49.958
It's the Koreans behind all this.

02:01:51.042 --> 02:01:51.958
Koreans?

02:01:55.792 --> 02:01:57.167
What makes you say that?

02:01:57.167 --> 02:01:59.625
Just trust me. It's the Koreans.

02:01:59.625 --> 02:02:01.375
Or the Chinese. One of them.

02:02:05.208 --> 02:02:06.500
Show him.

02:02:10.208 --> 02:02:12.500
I was driving around yesterday.

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:15.583
There's a big drone
dropping these everywhere.

02:02:15.583 --> 02:02:20.833
It means "Death to America,"
so we're thinking Iranians.

02:02:21.875 --> 02:02:25.667
I remember hearing something on NPR once
about their cyber capabilities.

02:02:29.333 --> 02:02:30.250
Why is that funny?

02:02:32.917 --> 02:02:35.208
Before the phones went out,

02:02:35.208 --> 02:02:39.167
I heard from a friend of mine in San Diego
about a similar event,

02:02:39.167 --> 02:02:43.000
drones dropping pamphlets
except they were in Korean.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.208
Or Mandarin.
Like I said, he couldn't tell which.

02:02:46.208 --> 02:02:49.875
But seeing as he did four tours in Iraq,

02:02:49.875 --> 02:02:52.583
he sure as shit would have known
if it looked like that.

02:02:58.417 --> 02:03:01.292
We made a lot of enemies around the world.

02:03:01.292 --> 02:03:03.958
Maybe all this means
is a few of them teamed up.

02:03:12.542 --> 02:03:14.500
I saw flamingos in our pool last night.

02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:19.708
The animals, they're trying to warn us.

02:03:22.208 --> 02:03:23.583
They know something.

02:03:24.875 --> 02:03:27.125
They know something that we don't.

02:03:27.125 --> 02:03:29.667
It's like when dogs know
storms are coming.

02:03:31.708 --> 02:03:33.500
There's more bike tracks up ahead.

02:03:40.125 --> 02:03:43.375
We should go back to the house.
My dad is probably there.

02:03:43.375 --> 02:03:45.750
Maybe he can help... us.

02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.625
I'm not going anywhere without Rosie.

02:03:56.250 --> 02:03:59.292
That house.
That's gotta be where she went.

02:04:01.625 --> 02:04:04.000
All right, let's go back
and see if they found Rose.

02:04:19.375 --> 02:04:22.167
G.H., what's going on?

02:04:24.917 --> 02:04:26.042
Before we go...

02:04:28.792 --> 02:04:31.042
I need to know
that you're on the level with me.

02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:37.125
No matter how far this thing goes,
I need to know that we're good

02:04:37.125 --> 02:04:39.750
because if what just happened here
is happening everywhere,

02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:42.000
we need to get to that bunker
Danny told us about,

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.250
and we need to get there now.

02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:45.875
What are you talking about?

02:04:50.333 --> 02:04:51.458
You know something.

02:04:56.833 --> 02:05:00.000
I had a sneaking suspicion,
but I wanted more information first.

02:05:00.958 --> 02:05:03.000
All signs were there, sure, but I...

02:05:04.167 --> 02:05:06.458
I didn't want to scare anyone.

02:05:06.458 --> 02:05:08.792
You'd have called me crazy
because it is crazy.

02:05:08.792 --> 02:05:11.708
It would have made more sense if we were
on the brink of an all-out invasion,

02:05:11.708 --> 02:05:12.917
but this...

02:05:15.375 --> 02:05:17.375
I didn't think we'd actually let
something like this happen.

02:05:17.375 --> 02:05:18.792
I thought we were smarter than that.

02:05:18.792 --> 02:05:20.000
Let what happen?

02:05:24.292 --> 02:05:26.542
Because my primary client
works in the defense sector,

02:05:26.542 --> 02:05:30.792
I spend a lot of time studying the cost
benefit analysis of military campaigns.

02:05:31.708 --> 02:05:35.250
There was one program in particular
that terrified my client the most.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.083
A simple three-stage maneuver that could
topple a country's government from within.

02:05:43.125 --> 02:05:46.250
The first stage is isolation.

02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:48.917
<i>Disable their communication
and transportation.</i>

02:05:49.917 --> 02:05:53.292
<i>Make the target as deaf, dumb
and paralyzed as possible,</i>

02:05:53.292 --> 02:05:55.458
<i>setting them up for the second stage.</i>

02:05:56.042 --> 02:05:58.042
Synchronized chaos.

02:05:58.042 --> 02:06:02.042
<i>Terrorize them with covert attacks
and misinformation,</i>

02:06:02.042 --> 02:06:03.958
<i>overwhelming their defense capabilities</i>

02:06:03.958 --> 02:06:08.125
<i>leaving their weapon systems vulnerable
to extremists and their own military.</i>

02:06:08.125 --> 02:06:12.292
<i>Without a clear enemy or motive,
people would start turning on each other.</i>

02:06:15.417 --> 02:06:19.375
If done successfully,
the third stage would happen on its own.

02:06:21.625 --> 02:06:23.042
What's the third stage?

02:06:27.833 --> 02:06:28.833
Coup d'état.

02:06:31.542 --> 02:06:32.542
Civil war.

02:06:36.542 --> 02:06:37.458
Collapse.

02:06:43.542 --> 02:06:46.125
This program was considered
the most cost-effective way

02:06:46.125 --> 02:06:47.958
to destabilize a country.

02:06:49.167 --> 02:06:52.083
Because if the target nation
was dysfunctional enough,

02:06:52.083 --> 02:06:54.833
it would, in essence, do the work for you.

02:07:01.208 --> 02:07:03.833
Whoever started this
wants us to finish it.

02:09:31.917 --> 02:09:32.917
