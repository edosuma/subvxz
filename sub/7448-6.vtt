takes care of all your problems.

00:10.578 --> 00:11.838
Rooster! (LAUGHS)

If there's anyone who can
put me away for a long time,

00:15.218 --> 00:16.938
it's you, mate.

00:16.938 --> 00:20.118
Just remember, it was your car.

00:20.118 --> 00:22.158
You were the last one
seen with Falconer alive.

00:22.158 --> 00:24.698
We did it.
Did what?

00:24.698 --> 00:27.558
Killed Falconer. Me and Muzz.

00:27.558 --> 00:29.038
Decker was
one of the kidnappers.

00:29.038 --> 00:31.058
We also have a sufficiency of
evidence hearing scheduled.

00:31.058 --> 00:32.558
We might have enough to arrest

00:32.558 --> 00:34.278
Anthony, Andrew and Decker
on conspiracy.

00:34.278 --> 00:35.938
Fine - service the Falconer brief
from Gangs,

00:35.938 --> 00:37.438
but let's have those arrests, eh?

00:37.438 --> 00:39.178
Dokic's evidence
corroborates O'Rourke's,

00:39.178 --> 00:40.718
but it's all circumstantial.

murder investigation

03:21.938 --> 03:23.998

03:23.998 --> 03:27.558
while Tim Browne and Gary Jubelin
attended other matters.

03:27.558 --> 03:30.958
Gary had picked up the threads
of an old, unsolved homicide

03:30.958 --> 03:33.318
he had first investigated
back in the '90s -

03:33.318 --> 03:36.718
the murder of three
Indigenous kids in Bowraville.

03:36.718 --> 03:41.518
In typical fashion,
he refused to give up on it.

03:41.518 --> 03:43.378
Because should these matters
have been solved?

03:43.378 --> 03:44.958
Yes, they should have.

been solved? Yes, they could have.

the proof to get a conviction

03:54.578 --> 03:56.318
can be two very different things.

03:56.318 --> 04:00.318

your pain and your anger.

Alright? I am a father
as well as a policeman.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.358
And I made you a promise before,
and I gave you my word

Within weeks, they were in
a committed relationship.

05:25.638 --> 05:30.238
Anthony 'Rooster' Perish's
paranoia had eased.

05:30.238 --> 05:34.278
Months had passed without
evidence of police activity,

05:34.278 --> 05:37.758
and he'd resumed full-scale
drug manufacturing.

05:37.758 --> 05:41.338
One 44-gallon drum
of precursor chemicals

05:41.338 --> 05:44.738

was still out in the cold

into the company's inner sanctum.

for anything. Alright?

12:51.858 --> 12:53.598
and think, what, serial killer,
thug, gangbanger?

12:53.598 --> 12:55.098
They're gonna look at him, Howard,

12:55.098 --> 12:57.258
and they're gonna listen,
hear his testimony

12:57.258 --> 12:59.158
and know that Anthony Perish
and Decker committed

12:59.158 --> 13:00.858
the most heinous of crimes,

13:00.858 --> 13:03.318
the type of crimes
that deserve the kind of justice

13:03.318 --> 13:05.098
a guilty verdict can deliver.

13:05.098 --> 13:08.418
Do we have a signed statement?
Not yet.

13:08.418 --> 13:11.078
Our source wants relocation
for himself and his family.

13:11.078 --> 13:12.578
Course he does.

13:12.578 --> 13:14.318
And we're waiting for
a positive DNA match

13:14.318 --> 13:16.298
linking Decker to JB's shooting.

13:16.298 --> 13:18.398
Which was also
at the behest of Perish?

13:18.398 --> 13:19.818
Very likely, yes.

13:21.738 --> 13:25.298
What do you want, Gary?
You know what I want, Howard.

13:25.298 --> 13:27.178
I want Strike Force Tuno
back up and running.

13:27.178 --> 13:30.138
And I want enough manpower
so my sergeant doesn't have to

13:30.138 --> 13:32.318
go out on the weekend
with his own fucking camera

13:32.318 --> 13:34.338
and do surveillance.

13:34.338 --> 13:36.498
And I want to catch
these pricks, Howard,

13:36.498 --> 13:39.158
and hold them accountable
for what they've done.

13:39.158 --> 13:41.378
I understand your frustration,

13:41.378 --> 13:45.338
but the reality is
right now, the cupboard's bare.

13:48.038 --> 13:49.618
Got anything else?

13:52.738 --> 13:54.618
They killed a guy,
they chopped him into pieces

13:54.618 --> 13:56.258
and then dumped him
in the fucking river.

13:56.258 --> 13:58.738
You'd think it'd be a priority
to get them off the streets.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.178
So, go over their heads.
Go higher up.

14:01.178 --> 14:04.378
If it was my superior
stopping me from doing my job...

14:04.378 --> 14:07.358
That's not how things are done
in the cops, Trace.

14:07.358 --> 14:08.858
Why not?

14:08.858 --> 14:12.358
Because you piss the wrong people off
in there and you get nowhere.

14:12.358 --> 14:13.978
OK.

14:15.638 --> 14:17.418
What about a jump to the left?

14:17.418 --> 14:20.118
You know, your mates at
the federal organised crime thingy.

14:20.118 --> 14:21.898
Oh, the Crime Authority, really?

14:21.898 --> 14:25.018
Well, why not?
You have a relationship.

14:25.018 --> 14:27.058
Yeah, based on mutual distrust
and loathing.

14:27.058 --> 14:28.778
Forget it.
So what?

14:28.778 --> 14:30.418
You told me that
all they care about

14:30.418 --> 14:33.218
is the money -
the proceeds from crime.

14:33.218 --> 14:34.958
They're not cops, Gaz,
they're bureaucrats,

14:34.958 --> 14:36.578
and Perish is made of millions.

14:36.578 --> 14:41.978
So, suck it up. Be nice.
What have you got to lose, huh?

14:41.978 --> 14:45.098
What?
What?

14:45.098 --> 14:48.218
Right, give it here.
Give what here?

14:48.218 --> 14:50.518
You're gonna do us both
a favour right now, Gary.

14:50.518 --> 14:53.458
Call them. Do it. Right now.

14:53.458 --> 14:56.238
Really? Just like that?
Enough! Call it!

14:56.238 --> 14:58.538
Go and call them.

15:01.218 --> 15:03.578
OK, I will then.
Good.

15:06.938 --> 15:09.178
Alright, now, Brett Simpson,
aka Decker,

15:09.178 --> 15:11.538
he's our best chance
of getting to Anthony Perish.

15:11.538 --> 15:13.898
We get Perish for murder,
you get his assets.

15:13.898 --> 15:15.718
And given the quantities of meth
he's been moving,

15:15.718 --> 15:17.258
we're talking millions.

15:17.258 --> 15:19.538
What do you think?
It's just hearsay so far.

15:19.538 --> 15:21.938
Anthony Perish
went to Decker's wedding.

15:21.938 --> 15:24.098
That's not hearsay.
Got any audio on this?

15:24.098 --> 15:25.938
Do we know what they're discussing?
No.

15:25.938 --> 15:28.058
So, it could be the footy,
the weather, anything.

15:28.058 --> 15:29.778
We don't have your resources.
That's why I'm here.

15:29.778 --> 15:32.798
I tell you what, Gary,
if this DNA comes back positive

15:32.798 --> 15:34.518
and we've got some real evidence,

15:34.518 --> 15:36.298
you'll have our backing.

15:36.298 --> 15:39.778
Strike Force Tuno might not be
a dead duck after all.

15:43.998 --> 15:46.978
(ENGINE RUMBLES)

15:55.858 --> 15:58.458
Thought you said
you could cook this shit.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.658
I can.
Well, where's the whizz?

16:00.658 --> 16:03.818
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Andy, are you in there?

16:03.818 --> 16:05.718
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Andy?!

16:05.718 --> 16:07.938
Just... One sec, one sec.

16:07.938 --> 16:09.558
Yeah, unlock the door,
I've gotta talk to you.

16:09.558 --> 16:12.218
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)

16:13.598 --> 16:15.738
What?

16:15.738 --> 16:17.798
My fuckin' credit card
keeps getting declined.

16:17.798 --> 16:20.578
Well, I told you to scale back.

16:20.578 --> 16:22.738
And I told you, Andy,
to go and ask Rooster.

16:22.738 --> 16:26.018
I'm not asking Rooster.
Then I will.

16:26.018 --> 16:28.958
No, you won't.
He scares the shit out of you.

16:28.958 --> 16:30.778
Now piss off and let me work.

16:30.778 --> 16:33.338
What are you doing in there, anyway?
It fucking stinks.

16:33.338 --> 16:35.618
I'm cooking fertiliser.
(SCOFFS)

16:35.618 --> 16:37.738
Yeah, like that's gonna
make us a small fortune.

16:38.818 --> 16:41.098
I'm doing the best
that I can, alright?

16:41.098 --> 16:44.138
Why don't you stand on a street
corner and flog your skanky twat

16:44.138 --> 16:45.978
and see how much money
you bring home?

16:48.038 --> 16:49.618
You dickhead!

16:52.538 --> 16:54.858
What are you smiling at?
Nothin'.

16:54.858 --> 16:56.838
Get back to work
or I'll have your balls.

16:56.838 --> 16:58.858
(RAPID BUBBLING)

16:58.858 --> 17:02.418

Shit!

17:08.917 --> 17:10.137
Fuck!

17:13.978 --> 17:16.978
(WHISPERS) You fuck up again
and I'll kill you.

17:25.718 --> 17:27.718
What?

17:27.718 --> 17:29.538
I've got the lab results back

17:29.538 --> 17:31.618
on the DNA test
from Decker's cigarette.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.378
And?
It's a negative.

17:33.378 --> 17:36.038
Not a match for the DNA on
the glove from the JB's shooting.

17:36.038 --> 17:37.978
Well, how can it not be a match?

17:37.978 --> 17:39.818
You sure it was his cigarette?
Yes.

17:39.818 --> 17:42.298
I saw him drop it and stub it out.
It was his cigarette.

17:42.298 --> 17:43.818
Then how?
I dunno.

17:43.818 --> 17:46.198
Maybe Little Willy's
just blowing smoke up our arse

17:46.198 --> 17:47.818
or Decker's bullshitting him.

17:49.878 --> 17:52.018
Fuck!

17:54.198 --> 17:56.938
There is one other option.

17:56.938 --> 17:59.098
Lab says given the sample size
and the time frame,

17:59.098 --> 18:00.998
there's the slight possibility
of a false negative.

18:00.998 --> 18:02.258
Meaning what?

18:02.258 --> 18:04.078
Could order another test
from another lab.

18:04.078 --> 18:06.098
And what's the downside of that?

18:06.098 --> 18:09.578
It's a long shot, it'll take
more time and cost over a grand.

18:09.578 --> 18:11.618
And we end up
with the same result.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.278
Cupboard's bare, Brownie.
So...?

18:17.278 --> 18:18.618
So, get the test.

18:20.658 --> 18:22.498
You've already ordered
the test, haven't you?

18:22.498 --> 18:25.138
Yep.
(LAUGHS)

18:29.778 --> 18:33.618
Hey, I've got the kids
this weekend.

18:33.618 --> 18:36.418
Mm?
You up for that?

18:37.758 --> 18:39.658
I'd love to meet your kids.

18:39.658 --> 18:41.258
Yeah?
Yeah.

18:41.258 --> 18:43.198
Well, I'll organise
something fun, then.

18:43.198 --> 18:44.778
Alright.

18:44.778 --> 18:46.858
I've got some white boxes
in their room.

18:46.858 --> 18:49.458
I'll move them tomorrow,
you won't have to lift a finger.

Oh, I love it
when you talk all domestic.

19:33.638 --> 19:35.178
Yeah.

19:36.478 --> 19:38.498
Alright. Alright.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.458
I've gotta go in.
Go.

19:47.278 --> 19:49.258
I thought you'd want to hear this.

19:49.258 --> 19:51.958
Picked it up on a telephone
intercept about an hour ago.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.418
The first voice is Decker.

19:54.838 --> 19:56.578
OK, so we're involved.

19:56.578 --> 19:58.858
DECKER: Hey, prick,
I'm on my fucking honeymoon.

19:58.858 --> 20:00.898
MAN: You away?
Who's that?

20:00.898 --> 20:03.158
Mobile's registered to
a Mr Donald Duck.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.818
The call came from Surry Hills.

20:04.818 --> 20:06.658
DECKER: No, dickhead,
but the kid's at her mum's.

20:06.658 --> 20:09.158
This could be my last fuckfest
before my bitch drops.

20:09.158 --> 20:11.098
Add 'romantic' to his CV.

20:11.098 --> 20:13.938
MAN: Oh, mate, this one's
way too good to pass up.

20:15.318 --> 20:17.518
What do you reckon?

20:17.518 --> 20:19.698
It could be anything.

20:19.698 --> 20:22.238
Given Decker's form,
my money would be on a hit.

20:22.238 --> 20:23.878
Yeah, we think so too.

20:23.878 --> 20:26.798
DECKER: OK, meet you at the Parkway,

20:26.798 --> 20:28.318
under the frog, tomorrow at 1:00.

20:28.318 --> 20:31.038
OK, so at the moment we're thinking

20:31.038 --> 20:33.158
somewhere on the Wakehurst Parkway,

20:33.158 --> 20:34.818
and the 'frog' being rhyming slang

20:34.818 --> 20:36.938
for the road,
as in 'frog and toad' -

20:36.938 --> 20:39.538
so maybe a bridge
or somewhere with access.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.358
We've got a team out there
at the moment,

20:41.358 --> 20:43.018
looking for possible locations.

20:43.018 --> 20:45.278
I know it's a bit of
a stretch, but...

20:45.278 --> 20:47.578
..have you got any better ideas?

20:49.538 --> 20:52.338
Do you want to share?
No.

20:59.698 --> 21:01.858
GARY: I drive past
this way every day,

21:01.858 --> 21:03.858
and so would Decker
on his way to town.

21:03.858 --> 21:05.738
BROWNE: So sometimes
a frog's just a frog.

21:07.358 --> 21:09.138
Hopefully, Brownie.

21:09.138 --> 21:12.578
If I'm wrong,
FOCA have got a dozen teams

21:12.578 --> 21:14.458
between Balgowlah
and Narrabeen Lakes.

21:15.758 --> 21:17.858
Oh, for those sort of resources.

21:20.558 --> 21:22.538
Here we go.

21:30.978 --> 21:33.298

'cause that's Decker.

That's Vito Russo.

21:53.998 --> 21:55.338
That's the target.

Oh, well, you're dead, fucker.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.918
I believe you'll be needing
a bit of that. Is that right?

22:04.918 --> 22:06.778
That's the down payment.

22:12.518 --> 22:14.258
Well, what do we do?

You just do what you need to do.

40:38.598 --> 40:40.578
So Perish owns a share
of all those properties,

40:40.578 --> 40:42.258
under different aliases.

40:42.258 --> 40:44.678
He takes a regular cut of profits.

40:44.678 --> 40:47.958
And that's it? That's all there is?
That's all there is.

40:50.438 --> 40:52.078
It's not much of
a birthday present, is it?

40:53.218 --> 40:55.998
(LAUGHS) No, it's alright.

40:58.518 --> 41:02.158
Well, happy birthday, Brownie.
Let's go home.

41:07.038 --> 41:08.658
I don't know
where your dad's got to,

41:08.658 --> 41:10.558
but you guys ride home safe, OK?

41:10.558 --> 41:12.678
We will.
Ah. Speak of the devil.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.638
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

41:22.638 --> 41:26.018
Missed you, Daddy.
Missed you too, sweetie.

41:26.018 --> 41:28.118
Did you catch the bad guys, Dad?

41:28.118 --> 41:31.058
No, not yet, mate.
You will.

41:31.058 --> 41:32.318
Yeah, we will.

41:32.318 --> 41:35.458
Get you guys home, eh?
Your mum will be shouting at me.

41:35.458 --> 41:37.038
No, she won't.

41:37.038 --> 41:40.198
I promise I'll make it up
to both of you next time, OK?

41:40.198 --> 41:42.878
It was OK, Dad.
We had...we had an OK time.

41:42.878 --> 41:45.238
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:45.238 --> 41:47.298
Yeah?
Mm.

41:47.298 --> 41:49.398
Alright, jump on your bikes.

41:55.838 --> 41:58.218
See ya.
See ya.

41:58.218 --> 42:00.198
Watch the road, mate.

42:00.198 --> 42:02.478
They're great kids.
They are great kids.

42:02.478 --> 42:06.278
You look dog-tired.
I'm rooted.

42:08.078 --> 42:11.578
Hey, I had a look at your case work
for the Bowraville killings.

42:11.578 --> 42:13.458
Hope you don't mind.

42:13.458 --> 42:15.598
No, it's not classified.

42:17.218 --> 42:19.218
You know, I know what happened

42:19.218 --> 42:21.958
but I never actually saw...

42:23.658 --> 42:25.838
I don't know how you do your job.

42:28.878 --> 42:31.718
But I am so glad
you're out there, doing it.

42:37.118 --> 42:39.598
NARRATOR: After the disappointments
of the weekend,

42:39.598 --> 42:42.838
Gary Jubelin finally
got some good news.

42:42.838 --> 42:46.318
Decker's second DNA test
came back a positive match

42:46.318 --> 42:49.758
to evidence on file from
the JB's Bar & Grill shooting.

42:49.758 --> 42:52.998
It was all the encouragement
Police Command needed.

42:54.298 --> 42:57.178
Welcome to Strikeforce Tuno 2.

42:57.178 --> 42:59.918
Our primary aim remains the same -

42:59.918 --> 43:02.138
that's for the arrest and the
conviction of those responsible

43:02.138 --> 43:04.038
for the murder of Terry Falconer.

43:04.038 --> 43:06.158
And as always, things aren't
that straightforward.

43:06.158 --> 43:09.618
We're still reasonably confident
that Decker's been hired for a hit,

43:09.618 --> 43:12.118
using these two dickheads here,

43:12.118 --> 43:15.498
who we've identified as Vito Russo
and Michael Christiansen,

43:15.498 --> 43:16.998
as intermediaries.

43:16.998 --> 43:20.278
Now, preventing this hit is currently
our number one priority.

43:20.278 --> 43:23.378
On the last two mornings,
Russo and Christiansen

43:23.378 --> 43:25.058
have hooked up outside this gym.

43:25.058 --> 43:26.398
Steroid World.

43:26.398 --> 43:29.398
They could be talking about the
weather or football. But I doubt it.

43:29.398 --> 43:31.718
Hopefully, tomorrow, they'll
meet up again and we'll find out.

43:31.718 --> 43:34.138
We've got warrants to put bugs
in that car park.

43:34.138 --> 43:35.638
What about TIs?

43:35.638 --> 43:37.918
These guys are changing
their phones too often.

43:37.918 --> 43:40.898
Alright? We've done tower dumps.
Camille's into that.

43:40.898 --> 43:42.518
But I wouldn't hold your breath.

43:42.518 --> 43:44.698
For the moment, we continue to
surveil these three suspects.

43:44.698 --> 43:46.658
We get the LDs ready for tomorrow.

43:46.658 --> 43:48.738
Anyone got any questions?

43:48.738 --> 43:50.638
That's it.

43:53.158 --> 43:56.198
Sorry, Gaz, just heard about this.
What's our strategy?

43:56.198 --> 43:58.238
We go big? I can get us
in the weekend papers.

43:58.238 --> 44:00.798
Not this time. This time,
we adopt a zero profile.

44:00.798 --> 44:02.678
Yeah, but I think
the public deserves to know...

44:02.678 --> 44:04.518
Look, if we spook Perish,
he's gonna disappear.

44:04.518 --> 44:06.918
I can't have that happen.
Right.

44:06.918 --> 44:09.518
So, there's not really much
for me to do, then.

44:09.518 --> 44:11.618
What I want you to do
is field the calls from the press

44:11.618 --> 44:13.478
and you deny Tuno 2 even exists.

44:13.478 --> 44:15.918
Can you do that for me?
I worked with Rupert.

44:15.918 --> 44:18.838
I can do denial.
OK, thanks, Kyles.

44:18.838 --> 44:21.798
Just had a call from Drugs.
I'll leave you to it.

44:21.798 --> 44:24.338
They got intel on a meth lab
run by Andrew Perish.

44:24.338 --> 44:26.198
You mean Anthony Perish?

44:26.198 --> 44:27.878
It seems little brother's
gone out on his own.

44:27.878 --> 44:29.578
They're ready to move
but they don't wanna stuff up

44:29.578 --> 44:31.218
anything we've got going.

44:31.218 --> 44:33.838
No, tell them to take him down.

44:44.956 --> 44:47.276
Fuck!
(DOOR RATTLES)

44:47.276 --> 44:49.356
Police! Get down!
(OFFICERS YELL)

44:49.356 --> 44:50.976
Come on.
Come here, mate.

44:50.976 --> 44:53.336
You fucking piece of shit!

44:53.336 --> 44:58.036
Oh, fuck! This is so fucking...

44:58.036 --> 45:01.676
NARRATOR: Andrew Perish was arrested
in a textbook bust -

45:01.676 --> 45:05.756
his dreams of becoming
his own man up in smoke.

45:10.696 --> 45:12.556
They trashed this joint too.

45:12.556 --> 45:16.336
Fucking pigs.
Made a mess of the place.

45:16.336 --> 45:18.976
They said Andy was making drugs.

45:18.976 --> 45:21.156
Yeah, I heard. That's why I'm here.

45:21.156 --> 45:23.616
But it can't be true, can it?
No, of course not.

45:23.616 --> 45:25.516
It's all bullshit.

45:25.516 --> 45:31.196
What am I gonna tell the kids?
You don't tell them nothing, alright?

45:31.196 --> 45:32.796
I want you to go see him
as soon as you can.

45:35.496 --> 45:38.056
No, I want you to take it, Loz.

45:38.056 --> 45:39.836
Thanks.

45:39.836 --> 45:43.656
And ask him if there's another dog
we should be worried about.

45:43.656 --> 45:45.316
OK.

45:45.316 --> 45:48.196
And ask him if it was Tuno.
Tuna?

45:48.196 --> 45:51.096
Tuno. He'll know
what that means. Alright?

45:51.096 --> 45:52.936
OK.

45:52.936 --> 45:56.536
Alright? It's gonna be OK.

45:56.536 --> 45:58.096
Thanks, Rooster.

45:58.096 --> 46:00.356
I'll call you tomorrow.

46:03.656 --> 46:07.436
Come on. We're going for a drive.

46:16.676 --> 46:19.956
Hello.
Hello, stranger.

46:22.456 --> 46:24.776
Christ, that was a long day.

46:24.776 --> 46:26.816
Did you get everything you want?

46:26.816 --> 46:29.616
I never get everything I want.

46:29.616 --> 46:33.736
Still, you had a big win.

46:33.736 --> 46:35.616
You should be happy.

46:35.616 --> 46:38.216
I did have a win. It's good.

46:38.216 --> 46:39.396
It's good.

46:50.936 --> 46:53.156
I'm gonna kill that fucker.
