WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:04.129
IS IT TOO EARLY

00:02.169 --> 00:04.129
FOR A DIET SODA?

00:04.171 --> 00:06.590
(bottles rattle)

00:04.171 --> 00:06.590
IT IS NOT.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
GOOD MORNING, JUNE.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.221
COME. TAKE A SEAT.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.641
WHY ARE YOU

00:13.263 --> 00:15.641
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.058
IT HAS BEEN ONE YEAR

00:15.683 --> 00:17.058
TO THE DAY

00:17.100 --> 00:19.687
SINCE YOU MOVED

00:17.100 --> 00:19.687
TO NEW YORK CITY.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.063
OH. I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.941
IT HAS BEEN.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.941
ARE YOU FINISHED?

00:23.983 --> 00:25.860
I ASKED YOU

00:23.983 --> 00:25.860
TO SIT DOWN TODAY

00:25.901 --> 00:28.069
SO I CAN GIVE YOU

00:25.901 --> 00:28.069
YOUR ANNUAL EVALUATION.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.071
(sighs) THIS IS SILLY.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.071
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

00:30.113 --> 00:30.865
I'M GONNA

00:30.113 --> 00:30.865
BE LATE FOR WORK.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.158
YOU GOT A "D."

00:30.906 --> 00:33.158
A "D"?

00:33.200 --> 00:36.453
IT'S ALL SPELLED OUT RIGHT THERE

00:33.200 --> 00:36.453
ON THIS SHEET OF PAPER.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.038
WHAT DID I DO

00:36.495 --> 00:38.038
TO DESERVE A "D"?

00:39.122 --> 00:40.290
YOU TELL ME.

00:45.004 --> 00:47.506
WAS THAT IN SLO-MO

00:45.004 --> 00:47.506

01:21.164 --> 01:23.542

01:23.584 --> 01:28.839
SOMEWHERE NICE.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.425
ANYWAY, YOU SHOULD COME

01:28.881 --> 01:31.425
TO YOGA MORE OFTEN.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.801
I CAN TELL

01:31.466 --> 01:32.801
HOW STRESSED YOU'VE BEEN

01:32.843 --> 01:34.511
SINCE STARTING YOUR NEW JOB.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.638
WORKING ISN'T HALF AS STRESSFUL

01:34.553 --> 01:36.638
AS LIVING WITH CHLOE.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.724
THIS MORNING, SHE GAVE ME

01:36.680 --> 01:38.724
AN EVALUATION

01:38.766 --> 01:40.225
FOR MY FIRST YEAR

01:38.766 --> 01:40.225
LIVING IN NEW YORK.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.936
I GOT A "D."

01:41.977 --> 01:44.646
A "D"? OH, HONEY,

01:41.977 --> 01:44.646
THAT CAN'T BE.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.565
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT JOB,

01:44.688 --> 01:46.565
YOUR SKIN IS FLAWLESS,

01:46.607 --> 01:48.817
AND I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU

01:46.607 --> 01:48.817
TO HAVE APPLES.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.863
WAIT.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.863
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME

01:52.905 --> 01:54.322
YOU WENT ON A DATE

01:52.905 --> 01:54.322
WITH A GOOD GUY?

01:54.364 --> 01:56.075
I GUESS

01:54.364 --> 01:56.075
IT HAS BEEN A WHILE.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.035
THAT HAS GOTTA BE IT.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.160
CHLOE IS ALWAYS

01:58.077 --> 01:59.160
YELLING AT ME

01:59.202 --> 02:01.162
TO GET SOME MORE DUDES

01:59.202 --> 02:01.162

02:01.204 --> 02:04.165
SAY NO MORE, JUNE.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.165
I HAVE THE PERFECT MAN FOR YOU.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.795
JAMES' AGENT HAS

02:04.207 --> 02:07.795
THIS CUTE ASSISTANT, WILL.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.672
I DON'T KNOW.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.672
I DON'T REALLY DO BLIND DATES.

02:10.714 --> 02:14.051
ALTHOUGH I CAN HEAR

02:10.714 --> 02:14.051
CHLOE'S VOICE IN MY HEAD--

02:14.093 --> 02:16.177
"WOOF, WOOF."

02:16.219 --> 02:19.765
THAT'S HER, BARKING AT ME

02:16.219 --> 02:19.765
AND POINTING AT MY DOG HOUSE.

02:19.807 --> 02:20.975
WHAT IS HE LIKE?

02:21.016 --> 02:22.183
WILL IS JUST YOUR TYPE--

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
THIN, WHITE, AND PUNCTUAL.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.861
CHLOE, THIS ISN'T

02:31.610 --> 02:32.861

02:32.903 --> 02:34.404
THIS IS AN ART HOUSE CINEMA.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.202
BUT IT'S THURSDAY.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.202
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

02:41.244 --> 02:43.664
OH, NO REASON. WE'RE JUST HERE

02:41.244 --> 02:43.664
TO WATCH "ANNIE HALL,"

02:43.705 --> 02:45.206
PERHAPS THE GREATEST FILM

02:45.248 --> 02:47.793

02:51.630 --> 02:54.424
I KNOW, RIGHT? THANK YOU.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.136
THE FILM'S CALLED

02:54.466 --> 02:57.136

05:45.428 --> 05:47.472
FOR SOME MANIAC.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.224
I CAN TOTALLY RELATE.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.392
MY ROOMMATE DRIVES ME NUTS.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.271
SHE HAS RUINED AT LEAST

05:51.434 --> 05:54.271
SIX OF MY HATS.

05:54.313 --> 05:56.106
HAS SHE, UH, ORDERED YOU

05:54.313 --> 05:56.106
TO GET CHARO TICKETS?

05:56.148 --> 05:57.774
BECAUSE THAT'S

05:56.148 --> 05:57.774
WHAT I'M DEALING WITH.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.777
HERE--CALL ME. DO YOU WANNA SEE

05:57.816 --> 06:00.777
WHAT SPAULDING DID TO MY PHONE?

06:00.819 --> 06:03.613
I'LL--I'LL--I'LL TURN ON

06:00.819 --> 06:03.613
THE, UH, THE VOLUME.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.199
(vibrating)

06:05.240 --> 06:06.407
(Charo's voice) CUCHI CUCHI.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.407
CUCHI CUCHI.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.492
(laughs)

06:07.534 --> 06:09.452
RIDICULOUS, RIGHT?

06:13.456 --> 06:15.334
CUCHI SMOOCHIE.

06:15.374 --> 06:17.252
THAT WAS A NICE MOMENT,

06:17.294 --> 06:19.213
AND I RUINED IT.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.422
NOT--NOT THAT

06:19.254 --> 06:21.422
I'M SORRY THAT I DID IT,

06:21.464 --> 06:22.423
'CAUSE I'M NOT A QUAKER.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.634
YOU'RE WEIRD.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.303
I LIKE YOU.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.807
HEY, WILL.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.807
SO I JUST GOT HOME.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.434
I-I HAD

06:30.849 --> 06:33.434
A REALLY GREAT TIME TONIGHT.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.811
(Will) Me, too.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.271
So there's this new

06:34.853 --> 06:36.271
Thai place we should...

06:34.853 --> 06:36.271
(Call Waiting beeps)

06:36.313 --> 06:38.023
Oh. Hold--hold on.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.274
(scoffs) It's Spaulding.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.274
Let me call you back.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.525
SURE.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.525
(beep)

06:40.567 --> 06:42.443
WILL? WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG

06:40.567 --> 06:42.443
TO PICK UP?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
THAT WAS TWO RINGS.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
AND WHERE ARE MY CHARO TICKETS?

06:44.487 --> 06:46.073
(beep)

06:44.487 --> 06:46.073
FRIGGIN' IDIOT.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.449
I SWEAR TO GOD,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.449
WHEN MOTHERS BIRTH MORONS,

06:48.491 --> 06:50.535
ARE THEY DOING IT

06:48.491 --> 06:50.535
JUST TO UPSET ME?

06:50.577 --> 06:51.745
(door slams)

06:55.582 --> 06:56.541
YOU'RE SPAULDING?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.293
YEAH,

06:56.583 --> 06:58.293
CRISTINA GARDIACOS SPAULDING.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.460
THAT'S MY PEN NAME.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.921
WAIT.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.921
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.463
I'M DATING WILL.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.463
WHAT?!

07:02.505 --> 07:04.465
WHY ARE YOU DATING

07:02.505 --> 07:04.465
MY AGENT'S ASSISTANT?

07:04.507 --> 07:06.134
WHY DO YOU HAVE AN AGENT?

07:06.176 --> 07:08.095
JAMES AND I WANTED TO GET

07:06.176 --> 07:08.095
BACKSTAGE AT THE GRAMMYS.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.304
HE CALLED UP HIS AGENT,

07:09.346 --> 07:10.847
WILL SHOWED UP

07:09.346 --> 07:10.847
WITH BACKSTAGE PASSES,

07:10.889 --> 07:13.183
AND WITHIN THE HOUR,

07:10.889 --> 07:13.183
I WAS GETTING WRECKED

07:13.225 --> 07:14.475
IN A DRESSING ROOM

07:13.225 --> 07:14.475
WITH CEE LO.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.894
FUNNY TWIST--IT WASN'T

07:14.517 --> 07:15.894
ACTUALLY CEE LO.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.312
IT WAS A BOTTLE

07:15.936 --> 07:17.312
OF CHOCOLATE SYRUP.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.730
ANYWAY,

07:17.354 --> 07:18.730
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

07:18.772 --> 07:21.524
I NEED THIS KIND OF STUFF

07:18.772 --> 07:21.524
TO HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.902
I NEEDED

07:21.566 --> 07:23.902
AN AGENT'S ASSISTANT.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.486
BUT YOU'RE NOT A WRITER.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.487
YES, I AM.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.782
I HAVE A PEN NAME, AND I WROTE

07:26.529 --> 07:28.782
TWO PAGES OF A NOVEL

07:28.823 --> 07:30.367
CALLED "FIGS FOR MARIE."

07:30.409 --> 07:32.286
I GAVE IT TO JAMES' AGENT,

07:30.409 --> 07:32.286
AND HE SIGNED ME ON THE SPOT.

07:32.327 --> 07:35.496
CHLOE, YOU CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE

07:32.327 --> 07:35.496
OF WILL LIKE THIS.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.664
TAKE ADVANTAGE?

07:36.706 --> 07:39.376
JUNE, I GIVE MY AGENT 10%

07:36.706 --> 07:39.376
OF EVERYTHING I MAKE.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.295
TECHNICALLY,

07:39.418 --> 07:41.295
I'M PAYING WILL'S SALARY.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.670
BUT YOU'RE NOT MAKING THEM

07:41.336 --> 07:42.670
ANY MONEY.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.423
EXACTLY.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.508
I MAKE NOTHING,

07:44.464 --> 07:47.508
AND I STILL GIVE THEM 10%.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.136
THAT'S HOW GOOD

07:47.550 --> 07:49.136
OF A PERSON I AM, JUNE.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.305
NO. WILL IS A GOOD PERSON.

07:51.346 --> 07:54.099
BY "GOOD," YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T

07:51.346 --> 07:54.099
MEAN GOOD AT HIS JOB. EXAMPLES--

07:54.141 --> 07:55.183
HE PUTS ME ON HOLD.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.810
I WENT TO VOICE MAIL

07:55.225 --> 07:56.810
LAST WEEK,

07:56.851 --> 07:58.519
AND HE STILL HASN'T GOTTEN ME

07:56.851 --> 07:58.519
THOSE TICKETS.

07:58.561 --> 08:02.523
DO YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT

07:58.561 --> 08:02.523
CHARO IS TO ME? DO YOU?

08:02.565 --> 08:03.817
SHE'S MY CHER.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.367
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND YOUR

08:10.073 --> 08:12.367
ANSWER IN THAT BOTTLE, JUNE.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.535
ONCE AGAIN, CHLOE HA--

08:14.577 --> 08:16.913
BEFORE I EXPLAIN, HOW LONG

08:14.577 --> 08:16.913
HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.206
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH

08:16.955 --> 08:18.206
TO COMMENT.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.834
HOW AM I GONNA TELL WILL

08:18.248 --> 08:20.834
THAT WE HAVE THE SAME BITCH?

08:20.875 --> 08:22.252
HE'LL PROBABLY

08:20.875 --> 08:22.252
THINK IT'S FUNNY,

08:22.294 --> 08:24.545
LIKE, IN A SMALL WORLD,

08:22.294 --> 08:24.545
WHAT-ARE-THE-ODDS KIND OF A WAY.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.547
LIKE HOW ME AND GERALD FORD

08:24.587 --> 08:26.547
HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.549
JACK NICHOLSON

08:26.589 --> 08:28.549
AND PETER FRAMPTON.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.427
HUH. TWO TALENTS.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.095
SEE? WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
(knock on door)

08:36.599 --> 08:38.559
(whispers)

08:36.599 --> 08:38.559
IT'S HERE. IT'S HERE.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.602
OH! (giggles)

08:39.644 --> 08:41.604
(exhales deeply)

08:43.606 --> 08:46.151
(exhales deeply)

08:43.606 --> 08:46.151
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS

08:46.193 --> 08:49.363
SINCE I'VE HELD SCRIPT PAGES

08:46.193 --> 08:49.363
BY WOODY ALLEN.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.572
THE NAME OF THE FILM

08:49.404 --> 08:51.572
IS "MONTE CARLO, MONTE CARLA."

08:51.614 --> 08:53.574
OBVIOUSLY, I WILL BE CARLO.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.617
YOU READ CARLA.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.577
(clears throat)

08:56.619 --> 08:59.039
(European accent) "CARLO,

08:56.619 --> 08:59.039
WHY ARE YOU ACTING THIS WAY?"

08:59.080 --> 09:00.581
"BECAUSE, CARLA,

09:00.623 --> 09:02.417
I'M A WOMAN."

09:02.459 --> 09:04.627
WHOA. COMPLEX CHARACTER.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.753
LUTHER, KEEP READING.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.839
"I AM GLAD

09:05.795 --> 09:07.839
THAT YOU ARE A WOMAN, CARLO,

09:07.881 --> 09:09.590
BECAUSE I'M A MAN."

09:09.632 --> 09:10.800
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.800
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT'S HAPPENING?

09:10.842 --> 09:12.302
I DON'T KNOW

09:10.842 --> 09:12.302
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.762
WHATEVER IT IS...

09:12.344 --> 09:14.762
IT IS GOOD.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.764
(gasps)

09:14.804 --> 09:16.764
(phone rings)

09:16.806 --> 09:18.599
(ring)

09:18.641 --> 09:19.767
DONNIE JARVIS' OFFICE.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.602
WILL, I JUST GOT

09:19.809 --> 09:21.602
THE SCRIPT PAGES.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.521
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CHARACTER

09:21.644 --> 09:22.521
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.771
Already on it, James.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.857
MY FRIEND OVER AT HIS PRODUCTION

09:23.813 --> 09:25.857
COMPANY FILLED ME IN.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.900
OH, IS DARLA STILL THERE?

09:26.941 --> 09:28.609
DARLA'S BEEN DEAD

09:26.941 --> 09:28.609
FOR FIVE YEARS.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.195
HERE'S THE DEAL--

09:28.651 --> 09:30.195
THE FILM TAKES PLACE

09:30.237 --> 09:32.613
AT A MENS'-ONLY BACCARAT ROOM

09:30.237 --> 09:32.613
IN MONTE CARLO.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.115
THE FEMALE LEAD DRESSES UP

09:32.655 --> 09:34.115
AS A MAN TO SNEAK IN,

09:34.157 --> 09:35.616
BUT LITTLE DOES SHE KNOW

09:35.658 --> 09:38.036
that a male journalist

09:35.658 --> 09:38.036
is dressing up as a woman

09:38.078 --> 09:39.620
TO EXPOSE THE ARCHAIC RULES

09:38.078 --> 09:39.620
OF THE CASINO.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.082
AGAINST ALL ODDS,

09:39.662 --> 09:42.082
THEY FALL IN LOVE.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.501
OHH. OF COURSE. (laughs)

09:44.543 --> 09:45.835
YOU'RE AMAZING, WILL.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.835
THANK YOU.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.546
(beep)

09:45.877 --> 09:47.546
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.922
I FOUND OUT

09:47.587 --> 09:48.922
THAT IF I GET THIS ROLE,

09:48.963 --> 09:51.591
I'M GONNA WIN

09:48.963 --> 09:51.591
AN ACADEMY AWARD.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.591
(gasps)

09:52.967 --> 09:54.635
SO DOES JAMES

09:52.967 --> 09:54.635
KISS YOU HELLO?

09:54.677 --> 09:55.636
HE'S ALWAYS

09:54.677 --> 09:55.636
KISSING ME HELLO.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.888
(laughs)

09:56.930 --> 09:58.639
FUNNY. SO...

09:58.681 --> 10:00.641
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT...

09:58.681 --> 10:00.641
I DON'T KNOW,

10:00.683 --> 10:02.894
HOW SMALL, UH, THE WORLD IS?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.645
EVERY TIME I SEE

10:02.936 --> 10:04.645
MY BUTCHER AT THE GYM.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.856
MM. WELL, IT TURNS OUT...

10:06.898 --> 10:09.276
MY BITCH IS YOUR BITCH.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.238
I FOUND OUT LAST NIGHT

10:10.693 --> 10:13.238
THAT MY ROOMMATE CHLOE

10:13.280 --> 10:16.450
IS YOUR OBNOXIOUS NOVELIST.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.450
HER PEN NAME IS SPAULDING.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.160
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:19.202 --> 10:21.662
WOW. THAT'S CRAZY.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.662
THAT--I CANNOT BELIEVE

10:21.704 --> 10:24.541
THAT WE BOTH HAVE TO DEAL

10:21.704 --> 10:24.541
WITH THE SAME...

10:24.583 --> 10:25.750
NUT CASE EVERY DAY.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.669
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.669
SHE--SHE IS A TOTAL NUT CASE.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.671
BUT I'VE LIVED WITH HER

10:28.711 --> 10:30.671
FOR A YEAR,

10:30.713 --> 10:33.674
AND I KNOW THAT

10:30.713 --> 10:33.674
DEEP, DEEP, DEEP...

10:33.716 --> 10:36.136
DEEP, DEEP DOWN...

10:33.716 --> 10:36.136
MM.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.346
THAT SHE IS

10:36.177 --> 10:38.346
A REALLY GOOD PERSON.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.973
AND I BET THAT IF

10:38.388 --> 10:39.973
WE ALL GOT TOGETHER,

10:40.014 --> 10:41.475
AND SHE HAD

10:40.014 --> 10:41.475
A CHANCE TO KNOW YOU,

10:41.516 --> 10:43.684
THAT THERE IS NO WAY

10:41.516 --> 10:43.684
THAT SHE'D BE ABLE

10:43.726 --> 10:47.314
TO CONTINUE

10:43.726 --> 10:47.314
TO TREAT YOU BADLY.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.690
OKAY.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.943
BUT ONLY IF

10:49.732 --> 10:51.943
YOU BUY THESE DRINKS.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.861
YOU'VE GOT IT.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.861
I'M KIDDING. GIVE ME THAT.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.280
NO.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.280
I'M SERIOUS. GIVE ME THAT.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.156
NO.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.156
I'M GONNA HAVE TO

10:55.322 --> 10:56.156
TICKLE YOU.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.282
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.575
(laughing) NO. NO.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.575
TICKLING...

10:58.617 --> 11:00.952
LOOK, GUYS, I UNDERSTAND

10:58.617 --> 11:00.952
YOU'RE TICKLING EACH OTHER,

11:00.994 --> 11:02.703
BUT THIS IS A POPULAR PLACE.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.122
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA

11:02.745 --> 11:04.122
ORDER ANOTHER ROUND,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.624
I'M GONNA NEED THESE SEATS.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.004
(exhales) GREAT REHEARSAL,

11:07.959 --> 11:11.004
LUTHER.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.964
I THINK WE'VE EARNED OURSELVES

11:11.045 --> 11:12.964
AN AFTERNOON SNACK.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.101
THAT'S WAY TOO EARLY.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.727
YOU'RE PUFFY.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.727

11:47.790 --> 11:49.042

11:49.083 --> 11:50.335

11:50.377 --> 11:53.004
WHEW. DISASTER AVERTED.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.004

I'M SORRY, JAMES. I JUST

11:55.798 --> 11:57.758

12:26.913 --> 12:28.789

12:28.831 --> 12:30.791
SO JUST TRY AND GET

12:28.831 --> 12:30.791

13:07.786 --> 13:10.290
(laughs)

13:07.786 --> 13:10.290
NO. THAT ISN'T FUNNY.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.833
I AM DONE TAKING YOUR CALLS

13:10.331 --> 13:12.833
WHEN I'M NOT AT WORK.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.503

13:12.875 --> 13:15.503

14:41.339 --> 14:43.633
WHEN HE STOOD UP TO ME.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.218
I THINK HE'S GREAT FOR YOU.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.427
THEN WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

14:46.469 --> 14:47.637

I CAN'T HAVE

14:47.679 --> 14:49.096
MY AGENT'S ASSISTANT

14:49.138 --> 14:50.640

15:21.838 --> 15:23.757
AT 3:45, NOT 9:00 A.M.

15:23.798 --> 15:24.965

CHLOE WROTE

16:08.217 --> 16:09.886

GET REPPED BY DONNIE,

16:11.137 --> 16:13.431
SO THAT WILL

16:13.473 --> 16:14.724
AND NOW HE WON'T

16:14.766 --> 16:16.016

16:38.080 --> 16:41.250
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME?

16:41.292 --> 16:44.044
HMM? THIS IS MY CAREER.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.131
THIS IS NOT A DATING SERVICE.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.131
THIS IS NOT A CONCIERGE.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.759
I DID NOT EMANCIPATE MYSELF

16:47.173 --> 16:49.759
AT THE AGE OF 14,

16:49.801 --> 16:51.051
THEN HIRE MY UNCLE

16:49.801 --> 16:51.051
AS MY MANAGER,

16:51.093 --> 16:52.345
THEN FIRE HIM,

16:51.093 --> 16:52.345
THEN HIRE MY MOTHER,

16:52.386 --> 16:54.806
THEN FIRE HER, AND THEN

16:52.386 --> 16:54.806
HIRE MY UNCLE BACK FOR THIS.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.477
DONNIE, LOOK AT ME.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.477
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.061
I SEE THE BEST.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.730
THAT'S RIGHT. SO HERE'S WHAT

17:01.103 --> 17:02.730
YOU'RE GONNA DO--

17:02.772 --> 17:03.648
YOU'RE GONNA HIRE WILL BACK

17:03.690 --> 17:05.065
SO HE CAN GET ME

17:03.690 --> 17:05.065
THAT 3:45 AUDITION TIME.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.276
OTHERWISE, I HAVE NO CHOICE

17:05.107 --> 17:07.276
BUT TO LEAVE THE AGENCY.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.528
BINGO BANGO, JAMES.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.071
WILL, WELCOME BACK.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.071
HAVE A RAISE.

17:11.113 --> 17:11.948
THANKS, DONNIE.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.240
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.240
I'M SORRY.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.075
DON'T I GET A SAY IN THIS?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.495
CHLOE, ENOUGH. STOP PRETENDING

17:15.117 --> 17:17.495
TO BE A NOVELIST

17:17.537 --> 17:19.539
SO YOU CAN BADGER WILL

17:17.537 --> 17:19.539
FOR FREE STUFF.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.081
I AM NOT PRETENDING.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.750
(Donnie) SHE'S A TALENT, JAMES.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.084
SHE'S ONLY GIVEN ME TWO PAGES,

17:24.126 --> 17:25.962
BUT THEY'RE SO AMAZING,

17:24.126 --> 17:25.962
I KNOW THEM BY HEART.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.756
"AS THE SUN SET

17:26.004 --> 17:28.756
OVER THE GREAT DIVIDE,

17:28.798 --> 17:30.008
"BUTTERFLIES

17:28.798 --> 17:30.008
RAINED DOWN ON MARIE

17:30.049 --> 17:32.552
LIKE FIGS IN JULY."

17:30.049 --> 17:32.552
(mouths words)

17:32.593 --> 17:34.387
MY WORDS.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.973
(gasps) JAMES!

17:37.015 --> 17:38.975
SHE STOLE MY NOVEL!

17:39.017 --> 17:42.603
THOSE ARE MY EXACT WORDS,

17:39.017 --> 17:42.603
IN MY EXACT WORD ORDER!

17:42.645 --> 17:44.146
SHE'S A FAKE.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.146
OF COURSE SHE IS.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.106
I'M ABOUT TO

17:44.188 --> 17:46.106
SLAP ME A PLAGIARIST!

17:46.148 --> 17:48.484
LUTHER. LUTHER.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.484
PUT THAT HAND DOWN.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.152
YOU ARE NOT INNOCENT IN THIS.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.779
IF YOU HADN'T TRIED

17:50.194 --> 17:51.779
TO SET UP WILL AND JUNE,

17:51.821 --> 17:53.113
NONE OF THIS

17:51.821 --> 17:53.113
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.115
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.035
I'M REVOKING THE VISION PORTION

17:55.157 --> 17:57.035
OF YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.369
OH, NO.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.620
OH, JAMES, COME ON.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.121
IT'S NOT LUTHER'S FAULT.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.121
IT'S MINE.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.916
LOVE IS YOUR FAULT, JUNE?

18:02.957 --> 18:04.124
LET ME TELL YOU

18:02.957 --> 18:04.124
WHAT I THINK ABOUT LOVE--

18:04.166 --> 18:06.126
I BELIEVE IN IT.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.128
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU AND WILL

18:06.168 --> 18:08.128
AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP

18:08.170 --> 18:09.589
IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

18:09.630 --> 18:11.925
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T INTERFERE

18:09.630 --> 18:11.925
WITH MY BUSINESS.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.634
ARE WE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE?

18:13.676 --> 18:14.928
YES.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.928
YEAH.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.262
(deep voice) NO.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.351
IT TOOK ME YEARS

18:20.266 --> 18:22.351
TO WRITE THAT NOVEL.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.144
FOUR TRIPS TO GEORGIA

18:24.186 --> 18:26.146
RESEARCHING

18:24.186 --> 18:26.146
BUTTERFLY MATING PATTERNS.

18:26.188 --> 18:29.943
AND IT SHOWS, WHICH IS WHY

18:26.188 --> 18:29.943
I CHOSE YOUR WORK TO STEAL.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.070
OH. IT DOES SHOW,

18:29.984 --> 18:32.070
DOESN'T IT?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.822
EACH WORD IS THERE

18:32.111 --> 18:34.822
FOR A REASON, YOU KNOW?

18:34.864 --> 18:37.033
NOTHING GRATUITOUS.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.033
NOTHING UNNECESSARY.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.159
"GRATUITOUS" AND "UNNECESSARY"

18:37.075 --> 18:39.159
ARE THE SAME THING.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.787
I WILL KILL YOU!

18:40.828 --> 18:42.162
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,

18:40.828 --> 18:42.162
NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.162
JAMES?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.749
WHERE'S THE PORCELAIN WOLF

18:42.204 --> 18:44.749
I BOUGHT YOU FOR CHRISTMAS?

18:44.791 --> 18:47.085
SO...

18:47.126 --> 18:50.170
YOU GOT YOUR JOB BACK.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.170
WE CAN CELEBRATE?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.548
UM, CHLOE SOLD ME

18:50.212 --> 18:52.548
HER CHARO TICKETS.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.175
JUNE, LET'S BE CLEAR--

18:52.590 --> 18:55.175
I  REALLY  WANT TO SEE

18:55.217 --> 18:57.261
SOME FEISTY LATINA ENTERTAINMENT

18:55.217 --> 18:57.261
WITH YOU.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.180
(laughs)

18:57.303 --> 19:00.180
BUT THIS CHAOS WITH CHLOE

18:57.303 --> 19:00.180
IS GETTING IN THE WAY.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.182
I MEAN, SHE GOT ME FIRED.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.102
WHY ARE YOU

19:02.224 --> 19:04.102
STILL LIVING WITH HER?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.186
YOU MAKE GOOD MONEY NOW.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.186
YOU CAN MOVE.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.480
I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S...

19:07.521 --> 19:09.189
SHE'S MY ROOMMATE.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.776
BUILDING. BUILDING.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.776
BUILDING.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.195
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER

19:11.818 --> 19:15.195
APARTMENTS YOU COULD LIVE IN,

19:15.237 --> 19:17.364
ALL WITH SANER PEOPLE

19:15.237 --> 19:17.364
IN THEM.

19:17.406 --> 19:21.201
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T HAVE TO

19:17.406 --> 19:21.201
LIVE WITH CHLOE ANYMORE.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.079
BUT I WANT TO.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.080
WHY?

19:24.122 --> 19:25.665
BECAUSE SHE PUSHES ME

19:24.122 --> 19:25.665
TO DO STUFF

19:25.706 --> 19:27.416
I'D NEVER DO ON MY OWN.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.209
IF SHE HADN'T

19:27.458 --> 19:29.209
GIVEN ME A "D,"

19:29.251 --> 19:31.211
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE

19:29.251 --> 19:31.211
ON A BLIND DATE WITH YOU.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.673
AND I NEVER WOULD HAVE

19:31.253 --> 19:33.673
KISSED YOU IN THAT RESTAURANT

19:33.714 --> 19:35.133
IF SHE HADN'T CALLED ME

19:33.714 --> 19:35.133
A QUAKER.

19:35.174 --> 19:40.220
50-YEAR-OLD SCOTCH?

19:35.174 --> 19:40.220
(laughs) WHAT?

19:40.262 --> 19:41.221
I GUESS I JUST

19:40.262 --> 19:41.221
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.223
SO LET ME BE CLEAR--

19:43.265 --> 19:45.225
I, TOO, WOULD LIKE TO SEE

19:45.267 --> 19:47.227
SOME FEISTY LATINA ENTERTAINMENT

19:45.267 --> 19:47.227
WITH YOU,

19:47.269 --> 19:50.272
BUT NOT IF IT MEANS

19:47.269 --> 19:50.272
MOVING THERE,

19:50.314 --> 19:52.274
THERE, OR THERE.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.400
ACTUALLY,

19:52.316 --> 19:53.400
THAT ONE'S A HOSPITAL,

19:53.442 --> 19:55.945
BUT YOU--YOU GET

19:53.442 --> 19:55.945
MY POINT.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.240
WORKING FOR DONNIE

19:58.781 --> 20:00.240
IS HARD ENOUGH.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.703
I CAN'T DEAL WITH ANY MORE CRAZY

20:00.282 --> 20:03.703
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.496
I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S FAIR.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.249
WELL, UH, CALL ME

20:05.538 --> 20:09.249
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR JOB.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.543
CALL ME IF YOU CHANGE

20:09.291 --> 20:10.543
APARTMENTS.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.545
(laughs)

20:12.586 --> 20:16.256
JUNE. SEE, THIS IS

20:12.586 --> 20:16.256
YOUR PROBLEM.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.424
IF THE MAN GOES THAT WAY,

20:17.466 --> 20:19.135
YOU SHOULD GO THAT WAY.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.261
I CAN'T GIVE YOU

20:19.177 --> 20:21.261
WHAT YOU NEED.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.764
I NEED YOU TO SHUT UP

20:21.303 --> 20:23.764
AND GO TO THIS CONCERT WITH ME.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.265
YOU'RE NOT GONNA

20:23.806 --> 20:25.265
TAKE WILL WITH YOU?

20:25.307 --> 20:26.266
NO, I WANT TO TAKE YOU.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.644
AS FRIENDS OR...

20:28.686 --> 20:30.104
YES. OF COURSE AS FRIENDS.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.105
OKAY, GOOD. YAY.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.314
"C"-MINUS.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.274
I JUST RAISED YOUR EVALUATION

20:32.356 --> 20:34.274
GRADE TO "C"-MINUS.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.276
I LOVE CHARO. I HAVE ALL

20:34.316 --> 20:36.276
27 OF HER RECORDS,

20:36.318 --> 20:37.570
EVEN THE ONES SHE RELEASED

20:37.611 --> 20:40.280
AS APRIL LOPEZ/

20:37.611 --> 20:40.280
LUPE ZAPATA DE VEGA VALDEZ.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.282
THOSE ARE HER TWO CHARACTERS

20:40.322 --> 20:42.282
ON "LOVE BOAT."

20:42.324 --> 20:43.492
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

20:43.534 --> 20:47.496
NOBODY DOES. THAT'S THE THING.

20:43.534 --> 20:47.496
SHE GETS NO INK.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.707
(clears throat) CHER COULD

20:47.538 --> 20:49.707
CHANGE HER TOOTHPASTE

20:49.749 --> 20:52.292
AND THE GAYS

20:49.749 --> 20:52.292
HAVE A WHOLE ROSE PARADE.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.254
HOW ABOUT A ROSE PARADE

20:52.334 --> 20:55.254
FOR CHARO, GAYS?

20:57.339 --> 20:58.298
(door slams)

21:02.344 --> 21:03.971
JAMES? WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.394
I HOPE I NEVER HAVE A CHILD,

21:10.436 --> 21:12.354
BECAUSE I'LL HATE

21:10.436 --> 21:12.354
TO TELL MY SON

21:12.396 --> 21:14.899
THAT THE DAY HE WAS BORN WAS

21:12.396 --> 21:14.899
THE SECOND-BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.358
DO YOU NEED SCRIPT PAGES?

21:16.400 --> 21:17.735
I DO NOT.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.698
OKAY. READY WHEN YOU ARE.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.242
(quietly) OKAY.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.791
MM.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.834
THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
