WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.736
- IN THE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.770 --> 00:04.372
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES

00:04.405 --> 00:06.274
ARE CONSIDERED
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.409
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.442 --> 00:10.444
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.478 --> 00:12.413
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.446 --> 00:14.082
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.350
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.653
- I'M NOT A VERY GOOD DRINKER.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.056
- I THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA THROW UP.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.391
- HE FOLLOWED ME
INTO THE BATHROOM

00:23.424 --> 00:25.193
AND ASKED IF I WAS OKAY.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.360
THEN HE...

00:26.394 --> 00:28.096
- PUSHED ME INTO THE CORNER,

00:28.129 --> 00:29.463
AND HE KISSED ME.

00:29.497 --> 00:33.334
- HE PUT HIS HAND UP MY SKIRT.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.136
I KEPT BEGGING HIM TO STOP...

00:35.169 --> 00:39.373
- BUT HE HELD ME DOWN.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.641
I MUST HAVE PASSED OUT...

00:40.674 --> 00:42.710
- BECAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP,

00:42.743 --> 00:44.545
MY PANTIES WERE MISSING,
AND HE WAS...

00:44.578 --> 00:47.315
- TAKING PICTURES OF ME
WITH HIS CELL PHONE.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.818
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT...RAPE
WAS SOMETHING A STRANGER DID,

00:50.851 --> 00:53.621
BUT I KNEW THE GUY
WHO RAPED ME.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.657
- ALL I CAN DO IS THINK...

00:56.690 --> 01:00.861
together: IF ONLY
I HADN'T GONE OUT THAT NIGHT.

01:00.894 --> 01:05.199
- IF ONLY
I'D DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.268
- THANK YOU ALL
FOR HAVING THE COURAGE

01:07.301 --> 01:11.439
TO SHARE YOUR STORIES.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.774
NOW, THE REST OF YOU
LOOK AROUND...

01:13.807 --> 01:18.446
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM
COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.

01:18.479 --> 01:22.650
ONE OUT OF FOUR FEMALE STUDENTS
WILL BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

01:22.683 --> 01:24.485
BEFORE SHE GRADUATES.

01:24.518 --> 01:28.156
WE MUST TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.
- HEY, KATHLEEN!

01:28.189 --> 01:31.192
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHERE'S OLIVIA?

01:31.225 --> 01:33.727
- LIV, UH...SHE'S VERY SORRY
SHE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.464
SHE'S GOT KID PROBLEMS.
SO HERE I AM.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.499
- WELL, JUST IN TIME.
YOU'RE UP NEXT.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.468
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, UP NEXT?
I'M--I'M SPEAKING?

01:40.501 --> 01:41.735
WELL, SHE DIDN'T
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.237
OKAY. WHAT AM I GONNA
TALK ABOUT?

01:43.271 --> 01:44.738
- HOW RAPE'S THE MOST COMMON
VIOLENT CRIME

01:44.772 --> 01:45.906
ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES,

01:45.939 --> 01:47.575
HOW MOST ARE COMMITTED
BY FRIENDS.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.343
- ALL RIGHT. YEAH.
SVU 101.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.912
- OUR NEXT GUEST SPEAKER

01:51.945 --> 01:55.483
IS DETECTIVE ELLIOT STABLER
FROM NYPD SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.517
[cheers and applause]

01:56.550 --> 01:58.486
[whistle blows]
RAPIST! RAPE!

01:58.519 --> 02:01.222
- NO! BETHANY!
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

02:01.255 --> 02:03.191
- BECAUSE YOU RAPED ME.
CHUCK MILLS RAPED ME.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.559
AND NO ONE DID
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.428
- NO! SHE IS LYING!
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.530
- POLICE.
STAY RIGHT THERE.

02:09.563 --> 02:13.301
NOW, JUST SO I'M CLEAR
ABOUT THIS...

02:13.334 --> 02:15.603
YOU'RE ACCUSING THIS MAN
OF ASSAULTING YOU?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.605
- HE RAPED ME.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.273
[crowd chanting]
DATE RAPE HAS GOT TO GO.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.741
- TURN AROUND.
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.410
- WHY?
- TURN AROUND.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.712
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
- WHY? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

02:24.745 --> 02:26.447
- PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.948
[crowd chanting] HEY, HEY, HO,
HO, DATE RAPE HAS GOTTA GO!

02:27.981 --> 02:31.285
[cheers and applause]

02:31.319 --> 02:32.753
- HEY, HEY, HO, HO!
OFF TO JAIL THAT RAPIST GOES.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.889
OFF TO JAIL THAT RAPIST GOES!
HEY, HEY, HO, HO!

02:35.923 --> 02:39.260
HEY, HEY, HO, HO!
OFF TO JAIL THAT RAPIST GOES!

03:28.776 --> 03:31.612
- I WENT TO A PARTY AND HAD
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.914
CHUCK WAS THERE.
- OKAY.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.617
AND WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
- LAST MAY.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.652
I WAS TOO DRUNK TO WALK HOME,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.621
AND CHUCK LIVED
ACROSS THE STREET.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.756
HE SAID I COULD CRASH
AT HIS PLACE.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.692
- SO...CHUCK IS YOUR FRIEND?

03:44.725 --> 03:47.561
- NO. WE MET THAT NIGHT.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.529
WHEN WE GOT TO HIS ROOM,

03:48.562 --> 03:50.631
HE TOOK OFF MY SHOES
AND TUCKED ME INTO BED.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.534
I REMEMBER THINKING
HE WAS SO NICE.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.735
- THEN SHE ASKED ME
IF I WAS SEEING ANYONE.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.271
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
SO BETHANY IS IN YOUR BED.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.972
WHERE WERE YOU?
- I WAS SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.709
UNTIL SHE ASKED ME
TO JOIN HER.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.976
- MM-HMM.
AND A PREMED LIKE YOURSELF,

04:03.010 --> 04:05.813
YOU COULDN'T TURN DOWN A CHANCE
TO GIVE HER AN ANATOMY LESSON?

04:05.846 --> 04:08.316
- I TRIED TO, AND NEXT THING
THAT I KNEW,

04:08.349 --> 04:11.419
SHE WAS ALL OVER ME!

04:11.452 --> 04:14.422
- NEXT THING I REMEMBER
IS WAKING UP, AND HE--

04:24.765 --> 04:27.668
HE WAS ON TOP OF ME.

04:27.701 --> 04:31.805
AND THEN INSIDE ME.

04:31.839 --> 04:35.409
IT WAS OVER
BEFORE I COULD DO ANYTHING.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.811
- IT WAS JUST A HOOKUP.
SHE WANTED A RELATIONSHIP.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.513
- AND YOU WEREN'T
INTERESTED IN THAT.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.781
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
AND WHAT DOES SHE DO?

04:40.814 --> 04:43.684
SHE FREAKS OUT, RUNS AND TELLS
EVERYBODY THAT I ATTACKED HER,

04:43.717 --> 04:46.854
AND THEN DRAGS ME IN FRONT
OF THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.357
- SO...WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.392
- SLAP ON THE WRIST?

04:51.425 --> 04:52.860
THEY MADE ME DO
COMMUNITY SERVICE

04:52.893 --> 04:56.730
AND PUT A PERMANENT HONOR CODE
VIOLATION ON MY RECORD.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.733
- THEY ACTED LIKE ALL HE DID
WAS CHEAT ON A BIOCHEM FINAL.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.635
- BETHANY,
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?

05:01.669 --> 05:03.771
- CAMPUS POLICE.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.738
THE ONLY THING THEY DID

05:04.772 --> 05:07.641
WAS SEND US TO
THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.777
CHUCK RAPED ME.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.911
I WANT HIM PUNISHED.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.581
- DUDE, HAVEN'T I BEEN
PUNISHED ENOUGH?

05:13.614 --> 05:16.350
- SO YOU'RE THE VICTIM HERE.
- WE ARE WAY BEYOND THAT.

05:16.384 --> 05:20.888
THAT BITCH HAS A WEBSITE--
WWW.CHUCKMILLSRAPEDME.COM,

05:20.921 --> 05:25.726
AND EVERYTHING THAT SHE HAS
POSTED ON IT IS A TOTAL LIE.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.795
- DO YOU KNOW CHUCK MILLS?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.798
HE'S A RAPIST.
HE'S A PREDATOR.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.467
HE IS A SCUMBAG.
HE IS A DEFILER.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.902
THIS IS A SERIOUS WARNING.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.004
- WELL, I GOTTA SAY--
SHE MAKES A GOOD CASE.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.539
- WELL, IT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S TRUE.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.808
WHOEVER RANTS THE LOUDEST
ON THE INTERNET WINS.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.909
- YOU ASK ME,
SITES LIKE THESE

05:41.942 --> 05:44.745
ARE JUST MORE LITTER
ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.013
- GUYS, THIS ISN'T LITTER.

05:46.046 --> 05:49.617
THIS IS SOME POOR GIRL
TRYING TO GET JUSTICE.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.385
- OR REVENGE FOR BEING DUMPED.
- BETHANY WAS DRUNK.

05:51.419 --> 05:54.087
LEGALLY, SHE'S INCAPABLE
OF CONSENTING.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.689
- WELL, WHAT IF CHUCK
WAS DRUNK TOO?

05:55.723 --> 05:57.625
HOW DOES HE KNOW SHE WASN'T
SOBER ENOUGH TO CONSENT?

05:57.658 --> 05:59.693
- THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.629
IF YOU DRINK AND DRIVE
AND THEN YOU KILL SOMEONE,

06:01.662 --> 06:03.531
IT'S STILL YOUR FAULT.
- COME ON, LIV.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.765
WHAT DOES THE GIRL EXPECT?

06:04.798 --> 06:06.567
SHE GETS BOMBED,
GOES UP TO A GUY'S APARTMENT.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.835
WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO,
PLAY SCRABBLE?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.169
- IT'S THE GUY'S RESPONSIBILITY

06:09.202 --> 06:10.838
NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE SITUATION.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.072
- WOW. IT'S GETTING
TO A POINT

06:12.105 --> 06:14.708
WHERE A GUY NEEDS A PERMISSION
SLIP TO GET PAST FIRST BASE.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.109
- ALREADY DO.
SOME COLLEGES PASS THEM OUT

06:16.143 --> 06:17.911
AT FRESHMAN ORIENTATION.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.847
THEY CALL IT AN
"ONLY YES MEANS YES" LECTURE.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.716
- IT'S OKAY BY ME.
- YEAH, YOU SAY THAT NOW,

06:22.750 --> 06:24.452
BUT DIDN'T YOU HOOK UP
WITH KATHY

06:24.485 --> 06:25.753
OVER A KEG
AT A FRATERNITY PARTY?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.921
- HOOK UP? NUMBER ONE,
I WAS NEVER A FRAT BOY,

06:27.955 --> 06:29.923
AND IT WAS A LITTLE MORE
ROMANTIC THAN THAT.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.825
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING?
- HARDWICKE.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.927
SEEING WHAT WE SHOULD DO
WITH CHUCKLES HERE.

06:33.961 --> 06:34.928
- I'M AHEAD OF YOU.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.498
HARDWICKE'S IN ALBANY
MEETING WITH THE A.G.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.899
TEMP ADA'S ON THE WAY.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.200
- WELL, HOPEFULLY,
IT'S SOMEONE

06:40.233 --> 06:41.935
WHO KNOWS HOW TO
SORT THROUGH THIS MESS.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.472
- HOW 'BOUT ME, HON?
MESSES ARE MY SPECIALTY.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.941
HEY, STABLER.
MISS ME?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.877
- SONYA.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.579
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

06:51.612 --> 06:54.548
- YOU MEAN...HOW DID I
ESCAPE THE DRUNK TANK?

06:54.582 --> 06:55.983
- NO. SHE MEANS "WHY US?"

06:56.016 --> 06:58.218
- [laughs] OH. PART OF MY
PROBATIONARY STATUS

06:58.251 --> 06:59.953
UNTIL I CAN PROVE TO THE D.A.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.723
THAT I HAVEN'T LOST
MY WINNING WAYS.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.694
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PHYSICAL
OR TRACE EVIDENCE?

07:06.727 --> 07:09.129
OH, GOD, YOU GUYS
NEVER MAKE IT EASY, DO YOU?

07:09.162 --> 07:10.898
- BETHANY DIDN'T COME FORWARD

07:10.931 --> 07:12.600
UNTIL MONTHS
AFTER SHE WAS RAPED.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.968
- AND LET ME GUESS.
NO WITNESSES EITHER, RIGHT?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.037
- NOTHING BUT INTERNET RUMORS
AND HEARSAY ON HER WEBSITE.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.540
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT WE GOT
HERE IS YOUR BASIC

07:19.573 --> 07:21.875
"HE-SAID, SHE-SAID,
SHE-POSTED-NASTY-COMMENTS."

07:21.909 --> 07:24.745
- AFTER SHE DRANK A LITTLE BIT
TOO MUCH TRASH CAN PUNCH,

07:24.778 --> 07:25.746
GOT PLASTERED.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.916
BUT...
YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

07:31.919 --> 07:35.055
- IT'S OKAY.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.925
REHAB, UM...

07:37.958 --> 07:40.894
REHAB ACTUALLY DID WONDERS.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.664
BUT IT DIDN'T TURN ME
INTO A MIRACLE WORKER.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.666
CONSENT IS UNCLEAR BECAUSE
THE COMPLAINING PARTY

07:45.699 --> 07:46.900
WAS DRUNK OFF HER ASS.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.936
IT'S A GRAY RAPE.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.871
- RAPE...GRAY OR NOT,
IS STILL RAPE.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.506
- NOT UNTIL
IT'S BLACK AND WHITE.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.976
RIGHT NOW, THIS CASE
IS AS BIG A LOSER AS THIS GUY.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.277
CUT HIM LOOSE

07:57.310 --> 07:59.880
TILL YOU FIND ME
SOMETHING THAT'LL STICK.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.650
UH...

08:02.683 --> 08:04.885
PLEASE.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.887
THANK YOU.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.991
- BETHANY JENNINGS. YEP.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.059
TOOK A REPORT FROM HER
LAST MONTH.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.227
- FOR RAPE.
- THAT WAS HER STORY.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.229
- RAPE BEEN A PROBLEM
ON CAMPUS?

08:16.263 --> 08:18.799
- WE DO OUR BEST TO KEEP
THINGS UNDER CONTROL,

08:18.832 --> 08:19.933
BUT MOST OF THESE KIDS,

08:19.967 --> 08:20.968
IT'S THEIR FIRST TIME
AWAY FROM HOME.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.937
THERE YOU GO.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.240
- ONE SHEET?

08:27.274 --> 08:28.876
NO NOTES, NO STATEMENT?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.944
DID YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT
CALLING THE POLICE?

08:30.978 --> 08:32.813
- ON THIS CAMPUS,
WE ARE THE POLICE,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.181
AUTHORIZED BY THE GOVERNOR'S
OFFICE, SAME AS YOU.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.315
- YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED

08:35.348 --> 08:37.084
TO CHARGE CHUCK MILLS
WITH A FELONY,

08:37.117 --> 08:38.719
WHICH IS WHAT HE COMMITTED.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.054
THIS...IS A JOKE.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.023
- WE TAKE RAPE VERY SERIOUSLY
AROUND HERE.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.594
WE ENCOURAGE OUR STUDENTS
TO REPORT ALL SEXUAL ASSAULTS.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.096
- TO YOU, NOT TO US.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.932
- WE TELL THEM TO MAKE A
DECISION THAT IS RIGHT FOR THEM.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.267
- YOU PRESSURE YOUNG WOMEN
NOT TO GO TO THE POLICE

08:54.301 --> 08:56.103
SO YOU CAN SWEEP RAPE
UNDER THE RUG.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.005
- THERE'S BEEN NO COVER-UP
HERE, DETECTIVE.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.109
I SEND EVERY ALLEGED RAPE
STRAIGHT TO THE DEAN'S OFFICE.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.177
- BASED ON THE TESTIMONY
OF BOTH MR. MILLS

09:04.211 --> 09:05.679
AND MISS JENNINGS,

09:05.713 --> 09:07.014
WE'VE DECIDED
THAT THIS INCIDENT

09:07.047 --> 09:08.315
WAS A CASE OF POOR JUDGMENT.

09:08.348 --> 09:11.585
- ON CHUCK'S SIDE.
- ON BOTH SIDES.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.353
- SO HE'S GONNA PICK UP
A LITTLE BIT OF TRASH,

09:13.386 --> 09:15.322
AND THE WHOLE THING
JUST GOES QUIETLY AWAY?

09:15.355 --> 09:18.826
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO, DETECTIVE,
THROW HIM IN JAIL?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.094
WHOM WOULD THAT HELP?
- BETHANY.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.063
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO SEE
THE GUY WHO RAPED HER

09:23.096 --> 09:24.798
WALKING FREE ACROSS CAMPUS
EVERY DAY.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.634
- PERHAPS WE SHOULD
LOCK HER UP AS WELL

09:26.667 --> 09:28.035
FOR UNDERAGE DRINKING.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.037
- HOW ABOUT YOU
FOR CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.005
OR ENDANGERMENT OF A MINOR?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.608
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THE COMMITTEE'S RULING.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.344
- NAH-AH-AH. THE FAMILY
EDUCATIONAL AND PRIVACY ACT

09:37.377 --> 09:40.113
REQUIRES THAT I GET THE CONSENT
OF BOTH STUDENTS.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.816
- OH. THAT'S CONVENIENT.
FOR CHUCK.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.885
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL SETTLE FOR

09:44.918 --> 09:46.820
THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE
ON THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.

09:46.854 --> 09:50.924
THEY'RE NOT HIDING BEHIND
ANY PRIVACY LAWS, ARE THEY?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.960
- [exhales]

09:52.993 --> 09:56.196
I'LL HAVE MY ASSISTANT
FAX YOU A LIST.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.700
- DO YOU THINK THESE
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE PEEPS

09:59.733 --> 10:01.001
WILL EVEN TALK TO YOU?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.903
- THEY WILL WHEN WE
SLAP 'EM WITH A SUBPOENA.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.972
- WHICH HUDSON'S ATTORNEYS
WILL CHALLENGE

10:05.005 --> 10:06.974
AS A VIOLATION
OF FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.408
I MEAN, THEY'LL LOSE,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.778
BUT THEY'LL KEEP MY ASS
IN COURT FOR A MONTH.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.079
- WE DON'T HAVE A MONTH.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.648
A COCKY CREEP LIKE CHUCK
WILL RAPE AGAIN.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.350
- WELL, CAN'T WE ALSO SUBPOENA
THE COMMITTEE'S RECORDS?

10:17.384 --> 10:19.787
THE CLERY ACT REQUIRES
THAT COLLEGES DISCLOSE

10:19.820 --> 10:21.154
ALL CRIMES
THAT HAPPEN ON CAMPUS.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.090
- YEAH. THAT'S WHY SCHOOLS
RUN THESE CRIMES

10:23.123 --> 10:25.025
THROUGH THEIR CARTOON COURTS
FIRST.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.995
HUDSON'S DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE
DIDN'T FIND THERE WAS ANY RAPE,

10:28.028 --> 10:29.963
SO THERE'S NO CRIME
TO REPORT, RIGHT?

10:29.997 --> 10:31.865
- MY TUITION DOLLARS,
HARD AT WORK.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.300
- EXACTLY THE POINT.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.268
HIGHER EDUCATION
IS BIG BUSINESS.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.805
AND NOBODY WANTS TO SEND
THEIR DAUGHTER TO RAPE U.

10:37.838 --> 10:41.208
- THIS COMMITTEE MEMBER
MIGHT TALK WITHOUT A SUBPOENA.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.145
- THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE
IS A JOKE.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.014
I SEE AT LEAST TWO WOMEN
A WEEK

10:47.047 --> 10:48.315
FOR WHAT'S CLEARLY A RAPE,

10:48.348 --> 10:51.051
YET HUDSON EXPELS
MORE STUDENTS FOR CHEATING.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.153
- SO WHAT HAPPENED
WITH BETHANY'S CASE?

10:53.186 --> 10:55.088
- WELL, I--
I CAN'T DISCUSS IT.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.857
ANY TESTIMONY

10:56.890 --> 10:59.092
WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST
LIKE ME IN ATTENDANCE

10:59.126 --> 11:02.996
MAKES IT EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE
TO ANYONE, INCLUDING THE FEDS.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.898
- SO THEY PUT YOU ON
THE COMMITTEE

11:04.932 --> 11:06.700
TO DO AN END RUN
AROUND THE CLERY ACT.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.069
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I QUIT.
NOW THEY BURY RAPES

11:09.102 --> 11:11.438
BY CALLING THEM ANYTHING
BUT WHAT THEY REALLY ARE--

11:11.471 --> 11:13.874
MISUNDERSTANDINGS,
IMPAIRED JUDGMENT.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.042
- SO THESE GIRLS GET DRUNK

11:15.075 --> 11:17.277
AND THEY END UP IN PLACES
THAT THEY'D NEVER GO SOBER.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.979
- LIKE A STRANGE GUY'S BED.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.248
- MIX IN A BUNCH OF HORNY KIDS
WITH BUCKETS OF BOOZE,

11:21.281 --> 11:22.983
AND YOU'VE GOT
A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.152
THAT'S WHY I STARTED
THE BUDDY SYSTEM HERE ON CAMPUS.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.021
- IT'S A LIKE A...
DESIGNATED DRIVER?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.957
- YEAH. MAKE SURE THEY DON'T
DO SOMETHING STUPID

11:29.990 --> 11:31.725
IF THEY DRINK TOO MUCH.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.026
- SO ONE KID STAYS SOBER

11:33.060 --> 11:35.095
WHILE THE OTHERS
GET EVEN MORE FRIED.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.797
- WELL, IT'S NOT PERFECT,

11:36.830 --> 11:38.966
BUT IF KIDS ARE GONNA DRINK,
AND THEY ARE,

11:38.999 --> 11:40.901
AT LEAST THEY'LL HAVE
A SAFETY NET.

11:40.934 --> 11:45.005
- WISH BETHANY
HAD A SAFETY NET THAT NIGHT.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.507
- LEGALLY, I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO SAY ANYTHING,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.309
BUT...

11:49.342 --> 11:52.212
YOU SHOULD ASK
YOUR DAUGHTER ABOUT THAT.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.083
- EVERYONE HERE KNOWS
I DON'T DRINK,

11:56.116 --> 11:57.417
SO THEY ALL WANT ME TO BE
THEIR BUDDY.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.987
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT BETHANY?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.222
- BECAUSE YOU'D SAY
I SCREWED UP.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.792
- [sighs]

12:04.825 --> 12:08.228
OKAY, KATHLEEN,
TELL ME WHAT--

12:08.261 --> 12:10.263
JUST TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

12:10.297 --> 12:13.000
- WE WENT OUT.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.168
SHE STARTED TALKING TO CHUCK.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.839
AND THEN I SAW A GUY
I REALLY, REALLY LIKE,

12:18.872 --> 12:22.142
AND WE WENT TO GRAB A COFFEE,
AND IT ONLY TOOK TEN MINUTES,

12:22.175 --> 12:24.878
AND THEN WHEN I WAS BACK,
BETHANY WAS GONE.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.081
I TRIED CALLING HER,
BUT SHE DIDN'T PICK UP.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.817
[crying]
SHE--

12:29.850 --> 12:32.119
- OKAY. OKAY.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.321
OKAY.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.324
YOU DIDN'T SCREW UP.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.794
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO WATCH
BETHANY, BUT I LEFT HER ALONE.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.129
- WE'RE GONNA GET THIS GUY.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.564
JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU
AND BETHANY WENT THAT NIGHT.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.967
- WE WERE AT A PARTY
AT THE LIBRARY.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.839
- MOM, DON'T WORRY.
I'M AT THE LIBRARY RIGHT NOW.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.244
- WASN'T LIKE THIS
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.413
- WE TELL 'EM NOT TO DRINK,
AND WE TEMPT THEM WITH ALL THIS.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.449
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.953
- OH, HE'S POPULAR
WITH THE LADIES, ISN'T HE?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.923
- NOT ALL OF THEM.
- FELICIA, YOU CRAZY BITCH!

13:09.957 --> 13:11.825
- LET GO OF ME, YOU PIG!
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

13:13.961 --> 13:15.128
- POLICE! ARE YOU OKAY?

13:15.162 --> 13:18.198
- HI, CHUCK. REMEMBER ME?
- YEAH. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.533
SHE--YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE--SHE CAME AT ME!

13:20.567 --> 13:23.570
- IT'S CALLED ASSAULT,
YOU DUMB ASS.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.173
- THERE WE GO.
- COME ON.

13:31.879 --> 13:32.946
- YEAH, THIS MAKES SENSE.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.448
A BITCH DUMPS A BREWSKI ON ME,
AND I GET ARRESTED.

13:35.482 --> 13:39.152
- SO...FELICIA'S A BITCH
AND BETHANY'S A SLUT.

13:39.186 --> 13:43.290
IS THAT WHAT WOMEN ARE TO YOU,
CHUCKIE?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.927
SLUTS AND BITCHES
FOR YOUR RAPING PLEASURE?

13:46.960 --> 13:49.262
- I GRABBED FELICIA
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.098
AND BETHANY IS FULL OF CRAP.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.100
I DIDN'T RAPE HER,
AND SHE KNOWS IT.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.434
- [sighs]
[click]

13:54.467 --> 13:57.570
A MISDEMEANOR SHOVING MATCH
IN A COLLEGE BAR.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.972
- MM-HMM.
- REALLY?

13:59.006 --> 14:00.073
- WELL, JUST DOIN' OUR JOBS.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.641
- YEAH. YOU'RE JUST
TREADING WATER

14:01.674 --> 14:04.011
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T PROVE
THAT HE RAPED BETHANY JENNINGS.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.345
- WHATEVER
GETS HIM OFF THE STREET.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.981
- ALL RIGHT. SO WHERE'S
THIS GIRL HE ASSAULTED?

14:08.015 --> 14:10.017
- FELICIA SAID THAT
SHE WOULD MEET US DOWN HERE.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.385
- RIGHT.
- OKAY, SHE'S TWO HOURS LATE.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.620
IN THE MEANTIME,
WE'LL JUST PUT HIM ON ICE

14:13.653 --> 14:14.621
UNTIL ARRAIGNMENT.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.956
- FOR WHAT?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.190
WE DON'T HAVE
A COMPLAINING WITNESS

14:17.224 --> 14:18.992
OR A SIGNED COMPLAINT.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.029
NOPE. CHUCKIE'S OUTTA HERE,
JUST LIKE ME.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.596
- THAT SON OF A BITCH WALKS,

14:23.630 --> 14:27.000
EVERY GIRL ON HUDSON'S CAMPUS
IS GONNA BE IN DANGER.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.103
- CUT HIM LOOSE, STABLER.
AND GO HOME.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.272
HAVE A DRINK.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.474
FOR BOTH OF US.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.978
- WHAT, YOU WANT
A BEER INSTEAD?

14:38.011 --> 14:39.913
- NO.

14:39.947 --> 14:43.083
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
THE FIRST NIGHT WE MET.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.587
YOU KNOW, IF WE HADN'T
GOTTEN DRUNK AND ALL...

14:47.620 --> 14:50.924
- WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED?
- OR NOT HAPPENED?

14:50.958 --> 14:53.693
- 26 YEARS
AND FIVE KIDS LATER,

14:53.726 --> 14:56.029
AND YOU'RE ASKING ME THIS?

14:57.264 --> 14:58.665
- YEAH.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.668
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT NIGHT?

15:01.701 --> 15:04.671
HOW MUCH I WANTED
TO KISS YOU.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.241
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.477
- 'CAUSE I WAS SCARED.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.115
- REALLY?
- [laughs] YEAH.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.449
- IT ONLY TOOK ME THREE BEERS

15:16.483 --> 15:18.251
TO WORK UP THE NERVE
TO SAY HELLO.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.719
- [laughs]

15:19.752 --> 15:21.588
- HELLO.
- HI.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.257
- THEN WE BOTH GOT DRUNK.
- [laughing] REALLY DRUNK.

15:24.291 --> 15:28.361
BUT...NOT SO DRUNK THAT
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.632
- OH, COME ON.
REALLY?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.634
- KATHLEEN, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING HOME.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.070
DO YOU WANT SOME DINNER?
- NO, THANKS, MOM.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.073
IT'S--JUST WANTED
TO DROP THIS OFF.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.409
- WHAT IS IT?
- JUST SOMETHING YOU SHOULD SEE.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.044
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO CAMPUS, DAD.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.412
- HOLD ON A SECOND.
LET ME JUST TAKE A LOOK.

15:45.445 --> 15:50.050
[telephone rings]

15:55.388 --> 15:58.025
THIS IS CHUCK MILLS'
DISCIPLINARY FILE.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.360
HOW'D YOU GET IT?

16:00.393 --> 16:01.728
- I DIDN'T STEAL IT.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.630
- SOMEONE DID. WHO?

16:06.199 --> 16:09.236
KATHLEEN, YOU GOTTA TELL ME.
WHO?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.604
- THE GUY I TOLD YOU ABOUT.
THE ONE I LIKE.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.008
HE WORKS IN THE DEAN'S OFFICE,
AND HE LEFT IT UNDER MY DOOR.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.377
- ON HIS OWN, OR DID YOU
ASK HIM TO GET IT FOR YOU?

16:17.410 --> 16:20.213
PLEASE TELL ME THE TRUTH.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.382
- CHUCK RAPED BETHANY
BECAUSE I SCREWED UP.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.517
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
TO HELP HER.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.786
- LOOK,
I-I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL,

16:26.819 --> 16:30.523
BUT...LEGALLY,
I CAN'T READ THIS.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.392
- YES, YOU CAN.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.194
YOU DIDN'T DIRECT ME
TO GET IT FOR YOU.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.396
I DID IT BY MYSELF.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.198
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.167
- LEGAL CONCEPTS 203.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.702
AS LONG AS I WASN'T
ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF,

16:42.735 --> 16:45.538
THE POLICE CAN USE IT.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.144
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.386
- MORNING.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.688
- IS IT?
MORNING, I MEAN.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.292
CALVIN WAS UP ALL NIGHT
WITH A STOMACHACHE--AGAIN.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.559
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE

17:06.593 --> 17:08.195
WHO DIDN'T GET
ANY SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.064
CHUCK MILLS'
DISCIPLINARY FILE.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.200
- HOW?
- DON'T ASK.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.834
BUT IT'S LEGAL.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.336
- DID YOU READ IT?
- THREE TIMES.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.705
AND EITHER BETHANY
WAS CHUCK'S FIRST RAPE,

17:18.738 --> 17:20.507
OR THAT FILE'S
BEEN SANITIZED.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.509
- SO NO ONE CAN ACCUSE
HUDSON OF A COVER-UP.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.278
EITHER WAY, IT DOESN'T HELP US?
- YEAH, BUT THIS MIGHT.

17:25.312 --> 17:28.515
IT'S A DIFFERENT INCIDENT
WHERE CHUCK IS THE VICTIM.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.218
- "CHUCK MILLS
IS A MURDERER."

17:31.251 --> 17:32.852
DO THEY KNOW WHO DID THIS?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.822
- YEAH. AND SO DO WE.
FELICIA ZORN.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.159
- THE GIRL WHO GAVE CHUCK
A BEER BATH.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.727
- DISCIPLINARY
COMMITTEE'S VERDICT

17:40.760 --> 17:42.362
CAME DOWN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.264
THEY WANT ME OUT
BY 2:00 TODAY.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.599
- THE UNIVERSITY EXPELLED YOU
FOR CALLING CHUCK A NAME?

17:46.633 --> 17:48.635
- NOT AT FIRST.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.604
BUT WHEN THEY TOLD ME I HAD
TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM IN WRITING,

17:51.638 --> 17:53.606
I KINDA LOST IT AND TOLD THEM
THEY COULD GO TO HELL.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.608
- WHY DIDN'T YOU COME DOWN
TO THE STATION LAST NIGHT

17:55.642 --> 17:57.344
AND TALK TO US?

17:57.377 --> 17:59.412
- SORRY. I WAS A LITTLE UPSET.
- OKAY, FELICIA...

17:59.446 --> 18:01.148
WHY'D YOU CALL CHUCK
A MURDERER?

18:01.181 --> 18:01.948
- BECAUSE...

18:01.981 --> 18:05.185
HE KILLED
CARLA VINCENT'S BABY.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.787
SHE THINKS CHUCK'S
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.522
- OKAY, LISTEN,
LET'S GO BACK A SECOND.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.192
SO...CARLA
IS CHUCK'S GIRLFRIEND.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.594
- UNLESS THERE'S SOME OTHER
GIRL HE'S TRYING TO PORK.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.296
- SO YOU'RE WATCHING OUT
FOR HER.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.730
- SOMEBODY HAD TO.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.766
YOU KNOW, SHE WASN'T HERE
A WEEK BEFORE HE WOOED HER,

18:19.799 --> 18:22.135
SCREWED HER,
AND GOT HER PREGNANT?

18:22.169 --> 18:23.436
ON HER FIRST HOOKUP?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.838
- AND YOU THINK
THAT HE MURDERED HER BABY.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.640
- SHE HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

18:27.674 --> 18:31.444
AND AFTERWARDS, I SAW THAT
DOUCHE HIGH-FIVING EVERYONE.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.745
- DOESN'T MAKE HIM
A BABY KILLER.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.182
- HE WAS BRAGGING
THAT HE TOOK CARE OF BUSINESS

18:35.215 --> 18:37.650
AND "FLUSHED THAT TOILET."

18:37.684 --> 18:39.786
- FELICIA DID YOU TELL
THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

18:39.819 --> 18:41.654
WHY YOU HUNG
THE BED SHEET BANNER?

18:41.688 --> 18:43.356
- EVERY TIME I TRIED,

18:43.390 --> 18:45.458
THEY SHUT ME UP LIKE THEY JUST
DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.160
JUST LIKE WHEN
I TRIED TO TELL CARLA

18:47.194 --> 18:48.728
THAT CHUCK WAS BAD NEWS.

18:48.761 --> 18:52.432
YOU KNOW, SHE WANTED
TO KEEP THAT BABY.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.703
- OF COURSE I WANTED OUR BABY.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.871
ME AND CHUCK
WERE GONNA BE PARENTS.

18:58.905 --> 19:03.943
- CARLA, WE'RE SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.346
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:06.379 --> 19:08.448
- IT HAPPENED LAST WEEK.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.750
I WAS ONLY EIGHT WEEKS
ALONG AND...

19:10.783 --> 19:14.354
I STARTED CRAMPING.
BAD.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.256
- DID YOU CALL CHUCK?

19:16.289 --> 19:18.358
- HE HAD TO STUDY.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.427
BUT HE WAS AS UPSET AS I WAS.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.929
I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE
THINK ABOUT HIM,

19:22.962 --> 19:25.765
AND NONE OF IT'S TRUE.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.767
THAT GIRL WHO SAYS
HE RAPED HER...

19:27.800 --> 19:30.337
CHUCK NEVER LAID
A HAND ON HER.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.738
HE WOULDN'T.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.674
- WELL, YOU KNOW YOUR FRIEND
FELICIA...

19:34.707 --> 19:36.776
SHE DOESN'T AGREE.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.913
- GIRLS COME ON TO CHUCK,
BUT HE ONLY LOVES ME.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.915
HE PROVED IT TO ME LAST WEEK,

19:42.949 --> 19:46.519
THE NIGHT BEFORE
I LOST THE BABY.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.326
[sniffling]

19:53.360 --> 19:55.362
- CARLA, DID
HE PROVE IT BY--

19:55.395 --> 19:57.764
BY HAVING SEX?

19:58.865 --> 19:59.932
- YEAH.

19:59.966 --> 20:04.837
HE CALLED AND TOLD ME
HE WAS GONNA ROCK MY WORLD,

20:04.871 --> 20:07.640
THAT HE HAD THIS STUFF
THAT WAS AMAZING.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.242
- STUFF?

20:09.276 --> 20:13.280
- HE CALLED IT...
LOVE POTION NUMBER 9.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.383
HE...HE PUT IT ON HIS...

20:16.416 --> 20:17.850
YOU KNOW.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.454
MADE IT FEEL ALL WARM
AND TINGLY DOWN THERE.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.424
- CARLA, UM...

20:24.457 --> 20:27.460
DID CHUCK SAY WHERE HE
GOT THIS STUFF?

20:27.494 --> 20:28.861
- HE MIXED IT UP HIMSELF,

20:28.895 --> 20:33.300
SOME KIND OF HERBAL SEX POWDER.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.468
- OH...

20:35.502 --> 20:39.372
AND YOU MISCARRIED
THE NEXT DAY.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.612
- NO. NO, HE DIDN'T.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.580
HE WOULDN'T.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.683
HE TOLD ME THAT...
HE WANTED THE BABY,

20:50.717 --> 20:52.485
THAT WE WERE
GONNA GET MARRIED.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.321
WHY WOULD HE LIE TO ME?

20:54.354 --> 20:58.425
- OKAY, CARLA, DID CHUCK
LEAVE ANY OF THAT, UM...

20:58.458 --> 21:00.293
LOVE POTION HERE?

21:00.327 --> 21:02.995
- NO. HE TOOK IT WITH HIM.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.534
- WELL, I THINK
HE MIGHT NEED IT AGAIN.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.971
- CARLA, BABY.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.374
DADDY'S HERE.

21:14.407 --> 21:19.512
YOU CALLED,
CHUCK-O-LUCK DELIVERS, BIG-TIME.

21:19.546 --> 21:20.780
WHOA!

21:20.813 --> 21:22.382
- DOESN'T LOOK
THAT BIG TO ME.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.983
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
- SONYA PAXTON.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.184
I'M FROM
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.387
I HEARD YOU HAD SOMETHING
THAT COULD REALLY ROCK MY WORLD.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.955
- HEY, FUNNY.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.424
YOU NEVER TOLD US
YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.060
- YOU GOT SOMETHING I WANT.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.595
GIMME THE LOVE POTION.
HERE.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.796
LET ME SEE IT.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.531
GIVE IT UP. COME ON.
- IS IT TRUE?

21:38.565 --> 21:40.900
DID YOU USE THAT STUFF
TO KILL OUR BABY?

21:40.933 --> 21:42.702
- YOU JUST CALLED.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.103
YOU TOLD ME YOU TALKED
TO THE DOCTOR,

21:44.136 --> 21:45.672
THE BABY WAS GONNA
BE OKAY AFTER ALL.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.407
- RIGHT. AND YOU COULDN'T
GET OVER HERE FAST ENOUGH

21:47.440 --> 21:49.342
TO FINISH THE JOB,
COULD YA?

21:49.376 --> 21:50.877
- YOU ARE A MURDERER!
- CARLA.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.579
- CHUCK MILLS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

21:52.612 --> 21:54.614
FOR ABORTION
IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.115
- I WANT A LAWYER.
- GET A GOOD ONE.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.817
'CAUSE I'M GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.852
- THERE'S NOTHING
IN THAT TUBE BUT LUBE.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.359
- IT'S PETROLEUM JELLY,
ALL RIGHT,

22:06.393 --> 22:07.960
MIXED WITH A DRUG
CALLED MISOPROSTOL.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.429
- OKAY. WHAT'S THAT?

22:09.462 --> 22:12.565
- AN OVER-THE-COUNTER
ULCER MEDICATION.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.634
- ARE UTERINE CONTRACTIONS
ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS?

22:14.667 --> 22:18.705
- ALONG WITH DIARRHEA,
HEADACHE, VOMITING.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.407
EVER SINCE THE MANUFACTURER
ISSUED A WARNING

22:20.440 --> 22:23.743
ABOUT MISOPROSTOL
WORKING AS AN ABORTIFACIENT,

22:23.776 --> 22:27.447
IT'S BEEN SELLING LIKE HOTCAKES
ON THE BLACK MARKET IN BRAZIL.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.915
- THEIR VERSION OF
THE MORNING AFTER PILL.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.750
- AND PRETTY SOON,
IT COULD BE OURS.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.585
DID YOU SEE THE OP ED PIECE
IN SUNDAY'S PAPER?

22:32.619 --> 22:34.587
[cell phone rings]
IT ADVOCATES

22:34.621 --> 22:36.489
FOR WIDER DISTRIBUTION
OF MISOPROSTOL.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.691
- STABLER.
- THE DRUG HAS SAVED

22:38.725 --> 22:40.660
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN'S LIVES
IN POOR COUNTRIES

22:40.693 --> 22:44.163
BY MAKING ABORTION INEXPENSIVE
AND SAFER THAN HOME REMEDIES

22:44.196 --> 22:45.565
AND BACK-ALLEY BOTCH JOBS.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.167
- CHUCK TOLD CARLA
IT WAS AN APHRODISIAC.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.702
- HE'S PREMED.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.804
HE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT THIS STUFF CAN DO.

22:51.838 --> 22:55.174
- YEAH, AND, UH, WHAT
HE WANTS TO DO NOW IS CONFESS.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.275
- MY CLIENT'S WILLING TO ADMIT

22:56.308 --> 22:59.479
HE USED MISOPROSTOL
DURING SEX WITH MISS VINCENT.

22:59.512 --> 23:02.815
- OH...THAT'S--
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.951
I'LL SEE HIS CONFESSION
AND RAISE HIS ABORTION CHARGE

23:04.984 --> 23:06.853
TO ASSAULT ONE.
- REALLY, SONYA,

23:06.886 --> 23:07.987
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE?

23:08.020 --> 23:10.022
- DEPRAVED INDIFFERENCE
TO HUMAN LIFE.

23:10.056 --> 23:14.561
HE USED HIS PENIS
TO DELIVER THAT DRUG INTO CARLA

23:14.594 --> 23:16.496
WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE,
KNOWING FULL WELL

23:16.529 --> 23:17.464
THAT IT WOULD KILL
THEIR BABY.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.832
- IF HIS USE OF THE DRUG
HAD ANYTHING AT ALL

23:19.866 --> 23:22.535
TO DO WITH CARLA'S
UNFORTUNATE MISCARRIAGE.

23:22.569 --> 23:25.905
- YOU GONNA...SIT HERE
AND TELL US IT DIDN'T?

23:27.907 --> 23:30.477
- SOMETIMES I DRINK TOO MUCH,

23:30.510 --> 23:33.846
AND I HEARD THAT
MISOPROSTOL WAS A WAY TO...

23:33.880 --> 23:36.583
UH, TAKE CARE OF
THE PROBLEM

23:36.616 --> 23:39.185
WITHOUT HAVING TO GET,
YOU KNOW,

23:39.218 --> 23:40.920
A PRESCRIPTION.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.455
- FOR WHAT?

23:42.489 --> 23:43.990
- FOR VIAGRA.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.525
- MR. MILLS
BOUGHT MISOPROSTOL

23:45.558 --> 23:46.993
TO TREAT HIS
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

23:47.026 --> 23:49.462
BROUGHT ON BY DRINKING.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.063
- WHISKEY CRAMPS A STIFFY.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.633
- REALLY, CAROLYN...
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE?

23:53.666 --> 23:55.502
- HERE'S A LETTER
FROM HIS DOCTOR

23:55.535 --> 23:57.704
CONFIRMING THE DIAGNOSIS
OF E.D.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.139
IN A SEALED ENVELOPE.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.774
- YEAH, CARLA TOLD US

24:01.808 --> 24:04.977
THAT HE DIDN'T TAKE MISOPROSTOL
WHEN SHE GOT PREGNANT,

24:05.011 --> 24:07.947
SO IF HE'S GOT E.D.,
HOW'D HE GET IT UP?

24:07.980 --> 24:10.617
- HE WASN'T DRINKING
THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD SEX.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.020
- DO YOU REALLY EXPECT US
TO BELIEVE

24:14.053 --> 24:15.788
THIS LIMP COCK AND BULL STORY?

24:15.822 --> 24:19.025
- MR. MILLS IN NO WAY
INTENDED TO HURT MISS VINCENT

24:19.058 --> 24:20.593
OR TERMINATE HER PREGNANCY.

24:20.627 --> 24:24.030
THE ONLY THING HE'S GUILTY OF
IS POOR JUDGMENT.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.665
- POOR JUDGMENT, MY ASS.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.534
- YOU ALMOST GOTTA
HAND IT TO CHUCKIE, THOUGH.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.901
PRETTY CREATIVE THINKING
HE COULD

24:28.935 --> 24:31.170
KILL CARLA'S BABY THIS WAY
AND GET OFF.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.772
- NOT NECESSARILY
IN THAT ORDER.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.707
- DEFENSE
REALLY DID THEIR HOMEWORK.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.509
MISOPROSTOL
IS APPROVED BY THE FDA

24:36.543 --> 24:38.511
FOR TREATMENT OF ULCERS
AND ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

24:38.545 --> 24:41.581
- CAUSING ABORTIONS
IS JUST A SIDE EFFECT.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.149
- SIDE EFFECTS ARE BIG BUCKS
FOR BIG PHARMA.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.585
VIAGRA STARTED OUT
AS A HEART FAILURE DRUG

24:45.618 --> 24:48.020
UNTIL PATIENTS NOTICED
THEY GOT A WOODY.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.989
- WHAT ABOUT BETHANY?
DID SHE SAY THAT CHUCK

24:50.022 --> 24:52.191
HAD ANY PROBLEMS
GETTING AROUSED THAT NIGHT?

24:52.224 --> 24:53.893
- SHE WAS PASSED OUT DRUNK.
SHE DIDN'T KNOW

24:53.926 --> 24:56.629
SHE WAS BEING RAPED
UNTIL IT WAS ALREADY HAPPENING.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.297
- BOTTOM LINE IS GRAND JURY
WILL NEVER INDICT CHUCK

24:58.330 --> 25:00.867
UNLESS WE CAN PROVE
THAT HE USED THE MISOPROSTOL,

25:00.900 --> 25:03.770
INTENDING TO CAUSE
CARLA'S ABORTION.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.038
- WELL, MAYBE CHUCK SAID
SOMETHING TO THE PHARMACIST

25:06.072 --> 25:08.641
WHO SOLD HIM THE STUFF.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.144
- IT'S HARD NOT TO
REMEMBER HIM.

25:12.178 --> 25:16.649
THE LITTLE BIT OF MISOPROSTOL
I HAD LEFT WAS ABOUT TO EXPIRE,

25:16.683 --> 25:18.818
AND NOT TOO MANY USE IT
FOR ULCERS ANYMORE.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.053
- THAT'S WHY CHUCK WANTED IT?
- HE CLAIMED IT WAS

25:21.087 --> 25:22.955
THE ONLY MEDICATION
THAT WORKED FOR HIM,

25:22.989 --> 25:24.724
AND HE SEEMED
PRETTY STRESSED OUT ABOUT IT.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.594
- YOU SELL THIS DRUG TO A LOT
OF STRESSED-OUT GIRLS TOO?

25:27.627 --> 25:29.896
- I HAVE TWO TEENAGE
GRANDDAUGHTERS.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.699
I KNOW WHAT THIS DRUG
IS CAPABLE OF.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.066
BUT IT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.568
AND ALL I CAN DO
IS WARN YOUNG WOMEN

25:35.602 --> 25:37.637
NOT TO TAKE IT
IF THEY'RE PREGNANT.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.905
- OKAY. YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE

25:38.938 --> 25:41.674
ABOUT, UH, THIS CHUCK GUY?

25:41.708 --> 25:45.612
- ONLY THAT, UH, HE LOOKED
A LITTLE YOUNG FOR A PENIS PUMP.

25:45.645 --> 25:46.746
- ONE OF THOSE
VACUUM TUBE THINGS

25:46.779 --> 25:49.015
THEY SELL ON THE BACK
OF MAGAZINES TO MAKE YOU BIGGER.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.282
OR SO I'VE HEARD.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.652
- THEY'RE NOT JUST
NOVELTIES, DETECTIVE.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.588
PENIS PUMPS HAVE LEGITIMATE
THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS

25:55.622 --> 25:57.289
FOR GUYS
WHO CAN'T GET ERECTIONS.

25:57.323 --> 26:02.061
AND MISOPROSTOL--
IT DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT ONE.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.129
- I DON'T KNOW
IF HE USED ONE THAT NIGHT.

26:03.162 --> 26:06.365
HE WENT INTO THE BATHROOM
RIGHT BEFORE WE DID IT.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.636
- CARLA, PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER
IF HE USED A PUMP THAT NIGHT.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.771
- I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT
ANYMORE.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.340
I JUST WANNA FORGET ABOUT IT.
- HE KILLED YOUR BABY.

26:14.373 --> 26:17.343
- AND NOTHING
WILL BRING IT BACK.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.845
I HAVE TO GO.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.179
- IF YOU PROTECT THIS GUY,

26:20.212 --> 26:21.914
HE'S GONNA DO THE SAME THING
TO ANOTHER GIRL.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.082
- PROTECT HIM?

26:23.115 --> 26:26.185
I'M TRYING TO PROTECT MYSELF,
OKAY?

26:26.218 --> 26:27.987
- FROM WHO, CARLA?

26:30.957 --> 26:34.761
- BEING WITH CHUCK WASN'T
THE FIRST TIME I HOOKED UP.

26:34.794 --> 26:38.030
I WAS PREGNANT ONCE BEFORE.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.667
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.169
BUT I DIDN'T KEEP IT.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.638
WHEN THE MISCARRIAGE HAPPENED,

26:45.672 --> 26:48.174
I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE
I'D ALREADY HAD AN ABORTION.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.243
- LOSING YOUR BABY
WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.712
- BUT IF I TESTIFY
AGAINST CHUCK,

26:52.745 --> 26:55.347
THEY'LL SAY THAT I CAUSED
THE MISCARRIAGE,

26:55.381 --> 26:59.185
THAT I WANTED IT TO HAPPEN
LIKE BEFORE.

26:59.218 --> 27:02.689
THEY'LL TELL THE WORLD,
AND EVERYONE WILL BELIEVE THEM!

27:02.722 --> 27:04.123
- LET'S SLOW DOWN.
WHO'S THEY?

27:04.156 --> 27:06.859
WHO TOLD YOU THAT
THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD SAY?

27:06.893 --> 27:10.697
- MS. MADDOX,
CHUCK'S LAWYER.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.002
- YOU WENT TO SEE
THE VICTIM, CAROLYN?

27:16.035 --> 27:19.772
- MY CLIENT WAS WORRIED
ABOUT MISS VINCENT.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.041
- YEAH.
WORRIED SHE MIGHT TESTIFY.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.043
SO MS. MADDOX LET SLIP
THAT SHE'D BE HAPPY

27:24.076 --> 27:25.678
TO PARADE AROUND
CARLA'S PAST ABORTION

27:25.712 --> 27:28.047
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO HEAR.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.415
- AND YOU THOUGHT I'D LET YOU

27:29.448 --> 27:31.851
ASSASSINATE A VICTIM'S
CHARACTER IN MY COURTROOM?

27:31.884 --> 27:33.119
- ALL DUE RESPECT, YOUR HONOR,

27:33.152 --> 27:37.356
YOU SHOULD BE ASKING MISS PAXTON
ABOUT CHARACTER ASSASSINATION.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.125
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN
GOING AFTER MY CLIENT

27:39.158 --> 27:40.426
ON ONE TRUMPED-UP CHARGE
AFTER THE OTHER.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.261
- CHUCK MILLS ALSO RAPED
BETHANY JENNINGS

27:42.294 --> 27:44.363
AT HUDSON UNIVERSITY
WHILE SHE WAS DRUNK.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.464
WE JUST COULDN'T PROVE IT.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.333
- PERHAPS YOU WOULD
LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO JUDGE QUINN

27:47.366 --> 27:50.336
HOW YOU HAPPENED TO LINK
MY CLIENT TO MISS VINCENT

27:50.369 --> 27:54.073
DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE
AND YOUR ALLEGED RAPE VICTIM

27:54.106 --> 27:56.075
HAVE NEVER EVEN MET.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.744
- THEY BOTH GO
TO THE SAME SCHOOL,

27:57.777 --> 27:59.411
AND THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT
IS REALLY GOOD AT THEIR JOB.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.413
- ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE
VIOLATING FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.750
- EXCUSE ME?
- THAT'S A SERIOUS CHARGE,

28:03.783 --> 28:05.184
CAROLYN.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.119
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO BACK IT UP?

28:07.153 --> 28:08.487
- DETECTIVE STABLER DOES.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.457
MY CLIENT'S CONFIDENTIAL
DISCIPLINARY FILE--

28:11.490 --> 28:14.360
IT'S THE ONLY WAY SVU
COULD KNOW THE SPECIFIC DETAILS

28:14.393 --> 28:16.195
OF WHAT HAPPENED
TO CARLA'S BABY.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.364
AND THE ONLY THING MORE GALLING
THAN HIM HAVING IT

28:18.397 --> 28:20.466
IS HOW HE GOT IT.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.470
- YOUR DAUGHTER?
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS

28:24.503 --> 28:25.504
TO DO YOUR OWN DIRTY WORK,

28:25.537 --> 28:27.406
SO YOU SENT YOUR KID
TO BREAK THE LAW FOR YOU?

28:27.439 --> 28:30.042
- NOBODY BROKE THE LAW!
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

28:30.076 --> 28:34.380
GOD! HOW MANY BRADY VIOLATIONS
DO YOU HAVE TO GET SLAPPED WITH?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.115
- IF YOU WOULD JUST SHUT UP--
JUST SHUT UP FOR ONE SECOND.

28:36.148 --> 28:39.018
- NO, NO, NO, YOU SHUT UP!
I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU, OKAY?

28:39.051 --> 28:41.287
YOU JUST HANDED CHUCK MILLS
A GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE--

28:41.320 --> 28:42.354
- CHUCK MILLS
ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE,

28:42.388 --> 28:44.824
BECAUSE I DIDN'T TELL MY
DAUGHTER TO TAKE THE FILE.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.325
- OH, RIGHT, RIGHT,
AND I SHOULD BELIEVE YOU

28:46.358 --> 28:48.861
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A REPUTATION
FOR PLAYING BY THE BOOK,

28:48.895 --> 28:50.296
AND IT'S BEYOND REPROACH.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.865
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

28:52.899 --> 28:55.034
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
ON THE SAUCE RIGHT NOW,

28:55.067 --> 28:58.204
'CAUSE I GOT A POLICY
AGAINST STRANGLING DRUNKS.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.143
GO HAVE A DRINK.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.416
- OKAY--
- ALL RIGHT. NO, NO, NO, NO.

29:10.449 --> 29:14.253
YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.055
THAT WAS UNNECESSARY.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.489
- SONYA--
- UNNECESSARY. NO, NO, NO.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.425
[exhales]

29:19.458 --> 29:21.393
FORGIVENESS, ACCEPTANCE.
THE PAST IS THE PAST.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.196
- SONYA, WE ACTUALLY GOT LUCKY
ON THIS ONE.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.397
IT FELL IN OUR LAP.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.067
- KATHLEEN KNOWS
CHUCK RAPED BETHANY.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.336
ALL SHE WAS DOING
WAS TRYING TO HELP ME

29:30.369 --> 29:34.573
NAIL THE SON OF A BITCH,
THAT'S ALL.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.909
- OKAY, THAT'S--
THEN THAT'S GREAT.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.577
SO I CAN TELL JUDGE QUINN

29:38.610 --> 29:42.114
THAT SHE'D BE MORE THAN WILLING
TO SWEAR TO THAT UNDER OATH.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.449
- WHAT DO YOU--N--

29:43.482 --> 29:45.952
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SUBPOENA
MY DAUGHTER.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.955
- YOU LEFT ME
WITH NO OTHER CHOICE.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.568
- WELL, IF I DIDN'T NEED
A DRINK BEFORE,

30:02.601 --> 30:04.803
I DO NOW.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.274
- [ahem] SONYA, UM,

30:08.307 --> 30:10.276
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.911
- ABOUT?

30:11.944 --> 30:13.579
- GETTING CHUCK MILLS' FILE.
I'M SORRY.

30:13.612 --> 30:17.216
- YEAH. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.551
LET'S JUST HOPE YOUR, UH,
YOUR DAUGHTER

30:19.585 --> 30:22.321
DOESN'T PERJURE HERSELF
TOMORROW.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.024
- KATHLEEN IS NOT
GONNA LIE UNDER OATH.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.592
- NOT EVEN TO PROTECT HER DAD?

30:26.625 --> 30:28.160
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO PROTECT ME FROM.

30:28.194 --> 30:30.496
I NEVER TOLD HER
TO GET THE FILE.

30:30.529 --> 30:31.998
- I'LL BELIEVE IT
WHEN SHE SAYS IT.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.900
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

30:33.933 --> 30:36.035
KATHLEEN ACTUALLY
DID US A FAVOR HERE.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.870
WE WOULDN'T HAVE A CASE
AGAINST CHUCK WITHOUT HER.

30:37.904 --> 30:40.106
- THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE
WHAT SHE DID.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.515
- IF YOU PUT HER
ON THE STAND,

30:49.548 --> 30:51.583
HUDSON'S GONNA KICK HER
OUT OF SCHOOL.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.585
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT FROM ME, STABLER.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.454
DO YOU WANT ME TO--WHAT,
SUBPOENA YOU

30:55.487 --> 30:58.224
SO YOU CAN DO THE PERJURING
AND PUT CHUCK AWAY?

30:58.257 --> 30:59.558
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE
ON THE STAND.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.560
AND WHAT--GO TO PRISON,
LOSE MY JOB AND MY PENSION?

31:01.593 --> 31:05.297
CAN'T FEED MY WIFE AND FAMILY?
WHAT, FOR MILLS?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.236
SONYA...

31:15.507 --> 31:20.913
MY DAUGHTER...

31:25.417 --> 31:29.521
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
WHEN EVERYTHING FALLS APART.

31:33.492 --> 31:36.495
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS
TO MY CHILD.

31:51.543 --> 31:55.982
- A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT

31:56.015 --> 31:58.484
GAVE YOU CHUCK'S FILE.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.653
KATHLEEN'S NAME WILL NEVER...

32:01.687 --> 32:04.423
BE PART OF THIS.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.029
UNDERSTAND?

32:11.763 --> 32:13.532
- THANK YOU.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.004
- STABLER.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.506
ARRAIGNMENT IS TOMORROW
MORNING, FIRST THING.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.175
BE THERE.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.388
- DOCKET ENDING 926,

32:36.422 --> 32:38.590
PEOPLE VERSUS
CHARLES WILSON MILLS.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.393
ONE COUNT EACH.
ABORTION IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

32:41.427 --> 32:43.229
ASSAULT IN THE FIRST.

32:43.262 --> 32:46.098
- MS. MADDOX,
HOW DOES YOUR CLIENT PLEAD?

32:46.132 --> 32:47.666
- NOT GUILTY ON BOTH COUNTS,
YOUR HONOR.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.136
- MS. PAXTON,
YOU CLAIM MR. MILLS SHOWED

32:50.169 --> 32:53.239
DEPRAVED INDIFFERENCE
TO HUMAN LIFE.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.740
BIT OF A STRETCH,
ISN'T IT?

32:54.773 --> 32:56.575
- THE DEFENDANT INJECTED
A DRUG INTO HIS VICTIM

32:56.608 --> 32:58.077
WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE,

32:58.110 --> 33:01.247
CAUSING HER TO ABORT
HER EIGHT-WEEK PREGNANCY.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.249
THE PEOPLE REQUEST
$1/2 MILLION BAIL.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.051
- THAT'S EXCESSIVE,
YOUR HONOR.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.285
MR. MILLS
HAS NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.020
AND NO MONEY.
HE'S NOT A FLIGHT RISK.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.056
- HE'S A RISK TO EVERY WOMAN
ON THE HUDSON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS

33:10.089 --> 33:12.458
IF HE'S ALLOWED
TO RETURN THERE.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.726
- SO ORDERED.
BAIL SET AT $500,000.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.128
CASH ONLY.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.064
- OBJECTION ON THE GROUNDS
OF BIAS.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.299
- BIAS, MS. MADDOX?
WHOSE BIAS?

33:20.332 --> 33:24.203
- YOURS, YOUR HONOR...
REGARDING THIS KIND OF CASE.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.810
- WE'LL TAKE
A TEN-MINUTE RECESS.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.245
[taps gavel]

33:34.746 --> 33:36.548
THANK YOU.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.650
THIS IS A PRIVATE MEETING,
COUNSELOR.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.652
- THEN YOU MUST BE DISCUSSING
THE LATEST SELECTION

33:40.686 --> 33:41.787
FROM OPRAH'S BOOK CLUB,

33:41.820 --> 33:45.091
BECAUSE IF THIS IS A PROHIBITED
EX-PARTE COMMUNICATION,

33:45.124 --> 33:46.525
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL
THE CHIEF JUDGE.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.327
- I WAS JUST TELLING MS. MADDOX

33:48.360 --> 33:50.496
THAT I'M RECUSING MYSELF
FROM THE CASE.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.764
- BECAUSE OF HER BIAS OBJECTION?

33:52.798 --> 33:54.366
- JUDGE QUINN SIMPLY HAS
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST

33:54.400 --> 33:56.768
THAT COULD CLOUD HER JUDGMENT.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.470
- SOUNDS AN AWFUL LOT
LIKE BLACKMAIL.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.072
- RELAX, SONYA.

34:00.106 --> 34:04.710
MS. MADDOX'S CONCERNS
ARE MISPLACED BUT APPROPRIATE.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.345
[knock at door]

34:06.378 --> 34:08.114
THERE'S MY REPLACEMENT.
COME IN!

34:08.147 --> 34:09.047
- JUDGE RIDIGER?

34:09.081 --> 34:11.083
- THANKS FOR COMING
SO QUICKLY, MARCUS.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.684
- ALWAYS A PLEASURE, SYLVIA.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.321
OH, SURPRISED TO SEE YOU
BACK HERE, MS. PAXTON.

34:15.354 --> 34:18.590
- HELLO. UH, I-I'M GONNA
HAVE TO REQUEST ANOTHER JUDGE.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.792
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH JUDGE RIDIGER?

34:20.826 --> 34:22.261
- I WAS ON THE ETHICS BOARD

34:22.294 --> 34:25.131
THAT SENT SONYA
TO REHAB LAST YEAR

34:25.164 --> 34:27.699
AFTER HER, UH,
COURTROOM CRACKUP.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.836
AND OBVIOUSLY, SHE THINKS
THIS WOULD AFFECT MY ABILITY

34:30.869 --> 34:33.139
TO TRY THIS CASE
IMPARTIALLY.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.507
- YOU DON'T?
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.209
ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT

34:37.243 --> 34:38.076
BEFORE WE GO TO TRIAL.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.812
- YOU WANT A...
PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING?

34:40.846 --> 34:42.714
- TO MAKE SURE ALL YOUR
DUCKS ARE IN A ROW.

34:42.748 --> 34:43.749
- OH.

34:43.782 --> 34:47.353
WE'RE SCREWED. OFFICIALLY.
- 'CAUSE OF RIDIGER?

34:47.386 --> 34:48.854
- OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM
LICKING HIS CHOPS.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.289
HE'S GUNNIN' FOR ME.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.191
- THAT'S NOT THE RIDIGER
WE KNOW.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.825
- LOOK, MAYBE I CAN END THIS
BEFORE IT BEGINS.

34:53.859 --> 34:56.795
I BET MADDOX WILL DEAL
IF I REDUCE THE CHARGE

34:56.828 --> 34:59.165
TO ISSUING
ABORTIONAL MATERIALS.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.499
- THAT'S A "B" MISDEMEANOR.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.135
HE'D GET MORE TIME
FOR SHOPLIFTING AN IPOD.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.471
- BEST I CAN DO, STABLER.
- NO, THE BEST THAT YOU CAN DO

35:05.504 --> 35:08.140
IS TAKE CHUCK TO TRIAL
AND NAIL HIS ASS TO THE WALL.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.276
- WE CAN'T EVEN GET
THE VICTIM TO TESTIFY.

35:10.309 --> 35:13.279
NO. THE SMART MOVE HERE
IS JUST NOT TO PLAY.

35:13.312 --> 35:17.249
- NOBODY IS MAKING
ANY DEALS.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.584
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

35:18.617 --> 35:20.586
- YOUR HONOR,
YOU RECUSED YOURSELF.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.921
- BECAUSE MS. MADDOX'S
INVESTIGATOR

35:22.954 --> 35:25.757
WENT DIGGING INTO MY PAST.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.826
I ASSUME IT'S THE SAME WAY
SHE FOUND OUT

35:27.859 --> 35:29.495
ABOUT HOW DETECTIVE STABLER'S
DAUGHTER

35:29.528 --> 35:31.830
GOT CHUCK MILLS'
DISCIPLINARY FILE.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.666
- AND CARLA'S ABORTION,
NO DOUBT.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.868
WHICH IS WHY I CAME HERE...

35:36.902 --> 35:39.605
TO HELP YOU WIN THIS CASE.

35:40.806 --> 35:45.611
LET ME PERSUADE
MISS VINCENT TO TESTIFY.

35:45.644 --> 35:49.615
I WAS STUDYING
TO BE A DANCER.

35:49.648 --> 35:53.619
ONE NIGHT, A BUNCH OF US
WENT OUT FOR PIZZA AND BEER.

35:53.652 --> 35:57.223
MY REWARD...
IF I DANCED WELL.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.827
THE DRINKING WAS A MISTAKE.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.630
I MUST HAVE BEEN STUMBLING
AS I CROSSED THE QUAD,

36:04.663 --> 36:08.367
BECAUSE THREE BOYS APPEARED

36:08.400 --> 36:11.670
AND OFFERED TO HELP ME
BACK TO MY ROOM.

36:14.673 --> 36:18.210
THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER,

36:18.244 --> 36:22.648
I WOKE UP...

36:22.681 --> 36:27.319
TO THESE BOYS...

36:27.353 --> 36:31.890
STANDING OVER ME...

36:31.923 --> 36:35.494
TAKING TURNS.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.636
SEEMED TO GO ON...

36:50.842 --> 36:54.380
FOREVER.

36:56.782 --> 36:59.017
WHEN THEY WERE DONE,

36:59.050 --> 37:00.919
THEY FORCE-FED ME PILLS

37:00.952 --> 37:05.691
SO THAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
I HAD OVERDOSED.

37:05.724 --> 37:09.761
POLICE NEVER CAUGHT THEM.

37:09.795 --> 37:12.764
THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY.

37:12.798 --> 37:18.270
ALL THEY WERE INTERESTED IN
WAS: WHAT WAS I WEARING?

37:18.304 --> 37:21.740
WERE MY TIGHTS
TOO REVEALING?

37:21.773 --> 37:24.976
HOW MANY BOYFRIENDS
DID I HAVE?

37:28.013 --> 37:30.849
NOW...

37:30.882 --> 37:34.386
THAT WAS ALMOST 40 YEARS AGO.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.788
I NEVER DANCED AGAIN.

37:39.625 --> 37:43.495
AND I NEVER GOT JUSTICE.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.368
- HE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED.

37:49.401 --> 37:53.772
- DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY
WITH WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.077
- YOU...

37:59.110 --> 38:03.815
CAN GET JUSTICE,
YOUNG LADY.

38:06.785 --> 38:11.390
BUT YOU MUST
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.868
- I'LL DO IT.

38:22.901 --> 38:25.337
I'LL BE THERE.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.642
HEY, THIS IS CARLA.
LEAVE A MESSAGE,

38:30.676 --> 38:32.344
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.
THANKS.

38:32.378 --> 38:34.380
[beep]

38:34.413 --> 38:37.949
- CARLA'S NOT ANSWERING.
- KEEP TRYING.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.051
- WHERE'S YOUR VICTIM,
COUNSELOR?

38:40.085 --> 38:42.588
- WE'RE TRYING
TO CONTACT HER NOW, YOUR HONOR.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.856
- I'D THINK A D.A. WHO'S TRYING
TO RESURRECT HER CAREER

38:44.890 --> 38:46.892
AFTER A VERY PUBLIC MELTDOWN

38:46.925 --> 38:50.061
WOULD MAKE SURE TO ESCORT
THIS YOUNG LADY IN BY THE HAND.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.401
- YOUR HONOR, THE PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST

38:55.434 --> 38:56.502
A CONTINUANCE.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.537
- OBJECTION.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.905
THE DEFENSE
IS READY TO PROCEED.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.073
- A CONTINUANCE
ON WHAT GROUNDS, MS. PAXTON?

39:02.107 --> 39:03.909
NEW EVIDENCE?
ADDED CHARGES?

39:03.942 --> 39:06.111
- YOUR HONOR, THE PEOPLE
REQUEST A CONTINUANCE

39:06.144 --> 39:09.047
ON THE GROUNDS OF...
A NEW VENUE.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.616
- DENIED.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.385
THE EXTRA 30 STEPS FROM
MY COURTROOM TO JUDGE QUINN'S

39:13.419 --> 39:15.353
DIDN'T OVERLY BURDEN
YOUR CASE.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.726
- THEN SIR, THE PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST

39:20.759 --> 39:22.127
A, UH--
A RECESS.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.763
A VERY SHORT RECESS.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.665
- YOUR HONOR, THE PEOPLE'S
INABILITY TO PROCEED

39:26.698 --> 39:28.734
IS A CLEAR VIOLATION
OF MY CLIENT'S RIGHT

39:28.767 --> 39:29.768
TO DUE PROCESS.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.837
I MOVE FOR IMMEDIATE
DISMISSAL OF ALL CHARGES.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.072
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT,
MS. MADDOX.

39:34.105 --> 39:37.409
YOU, APPROACH THE BENCH.

39:43.949 --> 39:48.153
COUNSELOR, I AM TRYING
TO BE REASONABLE HERE.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.456
BUT I WILL NOT
BE MADE A FOOL OF.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.190
HAVING YOU BEEN
DRINKING AGAIN?

39:52.223 --> 39:54.693
- NO, SIR.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.763
YOUR HONOR,
MY CASE IS IN ORDER.

39:57.796 --> 40:00.031
IF THE COURT WOULD JUST
INDULGE US FOR 30 MORE MINUTES,

40:00.065 --> 40:01.900
THAT'S ALL.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.435
- YOU USED UP
ALL YOUR INDULGENCES

40:03.469 --> 40:04.903
WHEN YOU WERE DRUNK IN COURT.

40:04.936 --> 40:08.006
- THEN PLEASE
GIVE ME THIS RECESS.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.576
NOT BECAUSE
I NEED A SECOND CHANCE

40:10.609 --> 40:11.943
BUT BECAUSE...

40:11.977 --> 40:15.814
A SCARED YOUNG GIRL
NEEDS A FIRST ONE.

40:17.082 --> 40:20.185
- RETURN TO YOUR TABLE,
MS. PAXTON.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.720
THE PEOPLE WILL PRODUCE
A WITNESS

40:21.753 --> 40:24.089
BEFORE THE END
OF BUSINESS TODAY

40:24.122 --> 40:26.892
OR THE CASE AGAINST
MR. MILLS IS DISMISSED.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.027
[pounds gavel]

40:32.030 --> 40:33.765
- THIS IS VERY UNORTHODOX
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

40:33.799 --> 40:36.468
- I'M NOT HERE TO SEARCH.
CARLA, I'M COMING IN.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.970
LOOK, NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU'RE SCARED ABOUT COURT,

40:39.004 --> 40:41.006
BUT I NEED YOU--

40:41.039 --> 40:43.875
OH, MY GOD.

40:43.909 --> 40:46.945
CALL AN AMBULANCE!

40:46.978 --> 40:49.915
CARLA.
CARLA.

40:58.724 --> 41:01.593
- CAUSE OF DEATH
IS TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.061
- FROM THE MISCARRIAGE.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.763
- A BACTERIAL INFECTION

41:04.796 --> 41:06.865
STEMMING FROM
THE INCOMPLETE EXPULSION

41:06.898 --> 41:08.867
OF THE PRODUCTS
OF CONCEPTION.

41:08.900 --> 41:09.901
- SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING IT

41:09.935 --> 41:11.737
EVERY TIME WE TALKED TO HER.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.004
- ANY OTHER TIME,
SHE MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED.

41:13.038 --> 41:16.007
BUT HER IMMUNE SYSTEM
HAD BEEN COMPROMISED....

41:16.041 --> 41:17.809
BY MISOPROSTOL.

41:17.843 --> 41:18.944
- I THOUGHT THE DRUG WAS SAFE.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.980
- WHEN TAKEN ORALLY AND
ABSORBED THROUGH THE STOMACH.

41:22.013 --> 41:25.517
BUT NOT WHEN APPLIED
DIRECTLY TO THE CERVIX.

41:25.551 --> 41:27.919
- THIS DRUG
JUST KEEPS ON GIVING.

41:27.953 --> 41:32.090
- YEAH.
AND IT JUST GAVE US CHUCK.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.927
- ONE MORE DOWN.
WHO'S BUYING?

41:35.961 --> 41:37.796
- NOT YOU, HOTSHOT.
YOU'RE CUT OFF.

41:37.829 --> 41:38.930
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

41:38.964 --> 41:40.932
- ARRESTING YOU.
- WHAT? NO, NO.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.569
THAT CASE WAS DISMISSED.
THAT BITCH NEVER SHOWED UP.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.837
- YEAH, AND SHE NEVER WILL
BECAUSE OF YOU.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.739
- CHUCK MILLS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.875
- W-WHAT FOR?

41:49.908 --> 41:51.076
- JUST A LITTLE FELONY

41:51.109 --> 41:53.011
CALLED MANSLAUGHTER
IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

41:53.044 --> 41:54.780
- C-CARLA'S DEAD?
- YEAH, YOUR LOVE POTION--

41:54.813 --> 41:56.782
IT BACKFIRED.
YOU KILLED HER.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.585
- YOU'RE GOING DOWN.
THIS TIME FOR GOOD.

41:59.618 --> 42:02.253
- LOOKS LIKE I GOT
MY WINNING CASE AFTER ALL.

42:04.289 --> 42:05.857
- SAY GOOD-BYE
TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS, CHUCK.

42:05.891 --> 42:08.026
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA MISS YOU.

42:08.059 --> 42:11.296
