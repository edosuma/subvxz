Incoming fire!

00:44.544 --> 00:46.580
<i>Gray haunted eyes,</i>

00:46.614 --> 00:50.618
<i>absentmindedly glaring</i>

00:50.652 --> 00:54.922
<i>from wide, uneven orbits.</i>

00:54.956 --> 00:59.259
<i>One brow drooping
some water over the eye.</i>

01:00.862 --> 01:03.765
<i>Because of a missile fragment,</i>

01:03.798 --> 01:06.333
<i>still inheriting skin deep</i>

01:06.366 --> 01:09.904
<i>as a foolish record
of old world fight.</i>

01:09.937 --> 01:11.338
Incoming!

01:13.941 --> 01:17.845
<i>I stand ready
with a boy's presumption</i>

01:17.879 --> 01:23.250
<i>to court the queen
in her high silk pavilion.</i>

01:30.925 --> 01:32.694
<i>How did it come to this?</i>

01:35.495 --> 01:40.668
<i>You once asked me how
we should describe our love.</i>

01:40.702 --> 01:43.503
<i>I'd say it was a result
of demons that arose</i>

01:43.537 --> 01:44.972
<i>from the trenches of France,</i>

01:45.006 --> 01:46.741
<i>where death was always
a bullet away.</i>

01:47.875 --> 01:49.877
<i>Your poems about the wolves</i>

01:49.911 --> 01:53.614
<i>spoke to a generation of men
who shared in your suffering.</i>

01:53.648 --> 01:56.550
<i>But I wasn't allowed in.</i>

01:58.653 --> 02:01.588
<i>And so they marked me dead,</i>

02:01.622 --> 02:03.791
<i>the day that I turned 21.</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:07.795
<i>They counted me as dead,
did they?</i>

02:09.463 --> 02:11.632
<i>The day my childhood
slipped away,</i>

02:11.666 --> 02:13.968
<i>the manhood was begun.</i>

02:14.001 --> 02:17.404
<i>Oh, that was
the right day to die.</i>

02:17.437 --> 02:18.906
- Incoming!
- <i>The 24th of July.</i>

02:22.476 --> 02:25.479
<i>When we were married,
I wanted to be everything.</i>

02:25.512 --> 02:26.981
<i>I wanted to be a painter,</i>

02:27.014 --> 02:28.548
<i>I wanted to fight
for women's rights.</i>

02:28.582 --> 02:30.383
Solving our own destinies.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.754
<i>You wrote your children's
tales to hide behind</i>

02:32.787 --> 02:36.356
<i>the nightmares of war,
and I was illustrating them.</i>

02:38.926 --> 02:40.695
<i>We were...</i>

02:40.728 --> 02:41.929
Partners.

02:41.963 --> 02:44.397
Partners.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.642
<i>If you invite
a serpent into your home,</i>

02:54.675 --> 02:57.745
<i>perhaps you shouldn't
be surprised if it bites you.</i>

03:06.687 --> 03:09.456
<i>I'd thought
a cottage in the hills.</i>

03:09.489 --> 03:15.062
<i>A cottage full of books,
pictures and bras, and...</i>

03:15.096 --> 03:17.098
<i>cozy nooks.</i>

03:17.131 --> 03:19.767
<i>flowers in the garden,</i>

03:19.801 --> 03:21.903
<i>walls all wet.</i>

03:23.971 --> 03:26.607
<i>I'd live there peacefully,</i>

03:26.641 --> 03:29.944
<i>and dream, and write.</i>

03:34.715 --> 03:36.717
<i>Dims his grave screams.</i>

03:36.751 --> 03:40.655
<i>I regret to write and tell you
that there's some problem...</i>

03:42.389 --> 03:43.991
<i>...died of wounds.</i>

03:46.794 --> 03:48.062
Hello.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.731
Oh, hello father.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.836
Oh, it's wonderful news.

03:54.869 --> 03:56.671
No, I'm... I'm happy for you.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.773
I've been trying to get them
see my drawings for years.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.108
<i>Was your love for me real,</i>

04:01.142 --> 04:04.111
<i>or a product of necessity.</i>

04:04.145 --> 04:06.647
<i>I tried desperately
to help you escape into</i>

04:06.681 --> 04:09.951
<i>an unthreatening world
where your poetry could thrive.</i>

04:09.984 --> 04:11.719
<i>I would comfort you,</i>

04:11.752 --> 04:14.387
<i>but you probably
don't remember that.</i>

04:18.592 --> 04:20.061
Please remember,

04:20.094 --> 04:22.997
our veterans are
the fabric of our nation,

04:23.030 --> 04:25.599
and we need to support them.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.435
Our next reader
requires no introduction.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.605
Mr. Siegfried Sassoon.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.807
Thank you.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.614
The anguish of the Earth

04:39.647 --> 04:42.717
absorbs eyes,

04:42.750 --> 04:46.419
till beauty shines
in all that we can see.

04:48.055 --> 04:51.659
War is our scourge.

04:51.692 --> 04:55.696
And yet, war has made us wise,

04:56.731 --> 05:00.533
and fighting for our freedom,

05:00.567 --> 05:04.071
we are free

05:04.105 --> 05:06.573
of wounds,

05:06.607 --> 05:09.509
and the anger at foe,

05:09.542 --> 05:14.514
and things lost desired.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.853
All these must pass.

05:20.621 --> 05:25.793
We are the happy legion,

05:25.826 --> 05:27.962
for we know that time

05:27.995 --> 05:31.732
is but a golden wind
that shakes the grass.

05:36.037 --> 05:37.805
Your poems
went down well, Sassoon.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.807
As did yours.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.474
- Hello, Robert.
- Hello.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.911
I was hoping to hear
some of your latest,

05:43.945 --> 05:46.881
or at least
an old poem, perhaps.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.816
Robert has nothing new to share.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.985
Another round of
the , John?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.653
Of course, Mr..

05:52.687 --> 05:55.056
- Robert.
- Yes?

05:55.089 --> 05:56.589
Are you well?

05:58.059 --> 05:59.961
Yes, of course.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.030
I miss our life in France.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.101
Wasn't a bad life then, was it?

06:07.134 --> 06:10.071
Hammering rain, mud puddles,

06:10.104 --> 06:11.538
rats and forth.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.674
You want to.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.076
Yes. Well...

06:17.211 --> 06:21.148
I've often said that war
is not the end, but...

06:21.182 --> 06:23.583
just the beginning
of the violence.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.292
I have applied for
a teaching post,

06:31.325 --> 06:34.261
Charterhouse next term.

06:34.295 --> 06:36.097
What about your writing?

06:38.099 --> 06:41.568
No one needs a war poet anymore.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.270
Unless they're dead.

06:45.206 --> 06:47.041
People don't like my new poetry.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.709
They like this modern...

06:51.578 --> 06:53.748
clever stuff.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.088
Besides, I need the money.

07:01.122 --> 07:02.823
I know.

07:02.857 --> 07:05.592
There is no money in poetry.
Hm.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.294
There is no poetry
in money either.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.067
Why don't we spend
a few days together, hm?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.036
to back

07:15.069 --> 07:17.537
and just give your work
a proper going over.

07:18.806 --> 07:22.643
Like the critical days
at the army depo.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.212
I'm yesterday's news, Sas.

07:34.221 --> 07:40.694
[footsteps thudding

07:47.735 --> 07:49.270
How are you feeling?

07:50.871 --> 07:52.873
Steady as a rock.

07:56.010 --> 07:57.611
What do you have there?

08:00.081 --> 08:01.682
"Dear Robert Graves.
On the recommendation

08:01.715 --> 08:03.751
"of certain members
of the teaching staff,

08:03.784 --> 08:05.219
"I'm pleased
to offer you the position

08:05.252 --> 08:06.887
"of assistant headmaster,
as well as teacher

08:06.921 --> 08:08.756
"of English here
at Charterhouse School."

08:15.896 --> 08:17.331
Should I accept?

08:18.799 --> 08:20.801
I mean, we need the money.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.071
We have the grocery,
I don't think the butcher

08:24.105 --> 08:25.906
is gonna extend credit
any longer.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.645
If you don't accept
this teaching position, Robert,

08:31.679 --> 08:33.914
I don't think we can go to
your parents' for help anymore.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.788
Supper will be ready soon.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.667
Catherine.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.670
Catherine, co...
come... come here.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.208
Listen.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.846
What are we supposed
to be listening to?

09:05.880 --> 09:08.749
Do you not hear
the nightingale sing?

09:08.782 --> 09:11.952
Nightingale has no reason to be
singing this late in the year.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.822
They usually stop
at the end of June,

09:14.855 --> 09:17.224
when their nesting season ends.

09:20.194 --> 09:22.363
A nightingale is
the bird of what?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.064
- Poetic love.
- That's right.

09:24.098 --> 09:26.867
And if a nightingale can sing

09:26.901 --> 09:30.804
on a chilly autumn morning,

09:30.838 --> 09:32.940
as passionately
and as sweetly as it does

09:32.973 --> 09:35.142
on the night of May...

09:38.112 --> 09:40.981
then there is hope for me yet.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.168
<i>Guidance.</i>

10:18.152 --> 10:20.788
<i>"The poet should not be
merely a stream of passage</i>

10:20.821 --> 10:22.323
<i>"between the source that is life</i>

10:22.356 --> 10:26.060
<i>"and the outlet that is poetry.</i>

10:26.093 --> 10:28.028
<i>"The poet should take
a more active role</i>

10:28.062 --> 10:30.030
<i>"in which he envisages life,</i>

10:30.064 --> 10:32.366
<i>"not as an influence
upon the soul,</i>

10:32.399 --> 10:35.736
<i>"but the soul as
an influence upon life.</i>

10:43.477 --> 10:47.915
<i>"The task of the poet is
to take the universe apart,</i>

10:47.948 --> 10:50.784
<i>"to re-integrate it
with his own vitality,</i>

10:50.818 --> 10:54.021
<i>"and it is
this re-integrated universe</i>

10:54.054 --> 10:56.490
<i>"that will in turn possess him,</i>

10:56.523 --> 10:58.425
<i>"give him rest.</i>

10:58.459 --> 11:02.296
<i>"If this voyage
reveals a futility,</i>

11:02.329 --> 11:06.533
<i>"then it is a futility
worth facing."</i>

11:06.567 --> 11:08.469
<i>Laura Riding.</i>

12:01.588 --> 12:03.123
Nancy.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.526
- And have a little bit a flour.
- Perfect.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.928
Nancy! She wrote to me.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.463
Who wrote to you?

12:09.496 --> 12:11.298
Laura Riding.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.603
Who's Laura Riding?

12:18.138 --> 12:21.075
But it's different
from anything else I've read.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.377
And she's talking about things
that concern women.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.046
Well, and Alan Tate's
the criteria

12:26.080 --> 12:27.514
and told me that she's just
won the group's

12:27.548 --> 12:29.617
top literary prize and...

12:29.651 --> 12:32.019
and she's looking
to move to England.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.187
Is she?

12:34.188 --> 12:36.156
We should ask her to come
stay with us.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.292
Perhaps, you two can work
on a project together.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.160
You think so?

12:41.629 --> 12:43.564
Perhaps she won't
wish to work with me.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.099
Why?

12:47.134 --> 12:50.137
Robert, you are
a highly successful writer

12:50.170 --> 12:51.905
with six books to your name,

12:51.939 --> 12:54.541
not to mention
two collections of poetry.

12:54.575 --> 12:56.110
You're wonderful.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.146
You're just going through
a dry spell.

13:01.115 --> 13:02.617
And you'd be content?

13:02.650 --> 13:04.652
No teaching post,

13:04.686 --> 13:09.189
money hard to come by
and her living with us?

13:11.191 --> 13:13.327
Let's write to her.

13:34.716 --> 13:36.316
Miss Riding,

13:36.350 --> 13:38.118
welcome to World's End.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.189
You must be Nancy.

13:43.457 --> 13:45.192
Ugh, England,

13:45.225 --> 13:47.494
the land of Byron and Keats,

13:47.528 --> 13:49.530
Shelley, Mary Shelley, that is.

13:51.532 --> 13:54.067
- Why do you paint?
- Why do you write?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.440
Well, this talented husband
of yours must write again.

13:59.473 --> 14:02.376
I have to say
your letters inspired me.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.111
As did your poems.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.580
Measure me by myself,

14:06.614 --> 14:10.984
not by time
or love or space or beauty.

14:11.018 --> 14:16.490
That I may be on my low stone,
a gauge unto myself alone.

14:16.523 --> 14:20.194
I would have
these old faiths fall

14:20.227 --> 14:23.030
to prove that
I was nothing at all.

14:26.801 --> 14:28.736
England.

14:28.770 --> 14:31.472
I can't believe I'm here.

14:31.505 --> 14:32.740
Oh.

14:32.774 --> 14:35.142
Hello.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.611
Come in.

14:36.644 --> 14:39.413
Come and introduce yourself.

14:39.446 --> 14:42.650
Um, Laura, this is our daughter,
Catherine Nicholson.

14:42.684 --> 14:44.284
Hello.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.286
What a handsome
young child she is.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.322
Just like her mother and father.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.324
Why do you wear those?

14:50.357 --> 14:51.693
Do you not like my necklaces?

14:52.727 --> 14:54.528
They're a lot.

14:54.561 --> 14:59.701
Catherine, it is very important
to be completely oneself.

14:59.734 --> 15:02.269
Many people don't know
everything about themselves,

15:02.302 --> 15:05.038
and therefore they do not
light up everything around them.

15:05.773 --> 15:07.675
We need a plan.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.176
A tutor.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.045
Yes, mother. Uh, Laura will
serve as a tutor to Catherine

15:12.079 --> 15:13.715
and also collaborate
with me on my next book.

15:13.748 --> 15:15.817
She is a brilliant poet.

15:15.850 --> 15:18.118
Robert and I both think so
and we think it's a wonderful

15:18.151 --> 15:20.822
idea that Catherine gets to see
the world through Laura's eyes.

15:20.855 --> 15:24.157
And she will live here
as well, then?

15:24.191 --> 15:25.459
Where else?

15:25.492 --> 15:28.095
And the teaching post
at Charterhouse?

15:29.664 --> 15:31.766
Uh, I turned it down.

15:31.799 --> 15:34.535
Robert wanted to concentrate
on writing his book with Laura.

15:37.772 --> 15:39.641
A-and you approve of this?

15:39.674 --> 15:41.475
I do.

15:42.744 --> 15:45.345
Miss Riding, how would
you instruct my granddaughter

15:45.379 --> 15:49.851
in the teachings of our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ?

15:49.884 --> 15:52.519
We all must return to Zion
at some point, mother.

15:52.553 --> 15:54.656
Well, perhaps,
in New York but in England

15:54.689 --> 15:58.693
we have very clear ideas about
proper religious instruction.

15:58.726 --> 16:01.228
- Of course.
- Miss Riding, I'm intrigued.

16:01.261 --> 16:04.866
What kind of book are you
and my son planning to write?

16:04.899 --> 16:06.600
Well, I've been interested
in his survey

16:06.634 --> 16:08.368
of the recent poetry movement.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.103
I think it's
about time we put those

16:10.137 --> 16:12.339
so-called modernist poets
in their place.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.875
What do you think Robert?

16:13.908 --> 16:16.376
I think that is a perfect idea.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.146
We... we...
we should start tomorrow.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.882
- Robert, you're forgetting.
- What?

16:20.915 --> 16:23.150
I wanted to ask Laura to come
into Oxford with me tomorrow.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.752
- All right.
- A friend of mine is doing

16:24.786 --> 16:26.788
a lecture
on the virtues of birth control.

16:26.821 --> 16:28.690
It'll be very interesting.

16:28.723 --> 16:30.725
I think you say these things
to provoke me.

16:30.758 --> 16:32.125
Birth control
is nothing more than

16:32.159 --> 16:34.528
an incitement to promiscuity.

16:34.561 --> 16:38.432
Well, when half the population
is under the poverty line

16:38.465 --> 16:40.602
with unwanted children,
it's quite difficult

16:40.635 --> 16:42.502
to put all
of my faith in God alone.

16:42.536 --> 16:44.438
Hear, hear.

16:44.471 --> 16:48.743
Miss Riding, I apologize for
our children's outlook on life.

16:48.776 --> 16:51.846
I should say.
I'm very grateful to be here.

16:51.879 --> 16:53.881
And of course,
Catherine's well-being

16:53.915 --> 16:55.783
and education is very important.

16:55.817 --> 17:00.120
I'll make sure to spend time
with both of them, equally.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.459
Should we agree to this,
uh, situation?

17:05.492 --> 17:08.261
If it enables Robbie
to get published

17:08.295 --> 17:10.798
then perhaps his financial
position will improve.

17:10.832 --> 17:12.667
Is that all you have to say?

17:12.700 --> 17:16.838
A maid and a tutor are more
to my son's status, anyway.

17:16.871 --> 17:18.572
Robert needs to write
a successful book

17:18.606 --> 17:20.875
and he needs people
to stop fussing over...

17:20.908 --> 17:23.343
Robert seems to think
he needs another woman

17:23.377 --> 17:25.747
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

17:25.780 --> 17:28.582
<i>I very much regret
to be doing this...</i>

17:36.724 --> 17:38.860
- <i>...Died of wounds.</i>
- <i>He was very gallant.</i>

17:40.895 --> 17:43.898
- <i>He was doing so well.</i>
- <i>Died of wounds.</i>

17:43.931 --> 17:45.733
<i>It is a great loss.</i>

17:49.704 --> 17:51.639
I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

17:51.673 --> 17:52.907
I'm all right. Uh, I'm fine.

17:52.940 --> 17:55.409
I'm... I'm... I'm all right.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.489
What is that?

18:09.523 --> 18:11.859
2, 3, 4 and 5.

18:11.893 --> 18:14.227
Very good. Keep going.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.999
Yes and spin
and a spin and a spin.

18:18.032 --> 18:20.333
- She's mad.
- Good morning.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.869
Oh!

18:21.903 --> 18:23.638
Did we wake you?

18:23.671 --> 18:26.540
- Yes.
- We were having so much fun.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.009
I hope you don't mind.

18:28.042 --> 18:29.911
I woke up with so much
energy that I took a walk

18:29.944 --> 18:32.579
and I thought I would make
an authentic New York breakfast.

18:32.613 --> 18:34.381
- My word.
- Gosh.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.783
- The things that you have here.
- This is marvelous.

18:35.817 --> 18:37.919
Yes.

18:37.952 --> 18:39.854
Let's pretend
we are on Delancey Street

18:39.887 --> 18:41.521
on the Lower East Side.

18:41.555 --> 18:42.924
What happens
on the Lower East Side?

18:42.957 --> 18:45.793
Well, face the very
few people, I believe.

18:45.827 --> 18:49.596
There are cramped buildings
and crowd filled streets

18:49.630 --> 18:53.500
with hardworking immigrants,
vibrant artistic community,

18:53.533 --> 18:56.738
Yiddish theater, poetry,
artists portraying the truth.

18:56.771 --> 18:59.372
The truth is what matters.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.743
As do these
divine potato pancakes.

19:02.877 --> 19:04.812
Now, eat before it gets cold.

19:04.846 --> 19:07.347
Well, I, for one, haven't had
such stimulating company

19:07.380 --> 19:08.950
for a long time, so thank you.

19:10.651 --> 19:14.387
Laura, we read
your poetry again last night,

19:14.421 --> 19:16.356
myself and Nancy and, um,

19:16.389 --> 19:18.425
with your permission,
I'd like to send your work

19:18.458 --> 19:20.661
to Virginia and Leonard Woolf

19:20.695 --> 19:22.462
who I'm hoping
in time will publish it

19:22.496 --> 19:24.464
on their Hogarth Press.

19:25.666 --> 19:26.801
My goodness.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.002
It seems
you silenced Miss Riding.

19:29.937 --> 19:32.405
These kind words from
a poet like your husband,

19:32.439 --> 19:34.742
I was just... cheers.

19:34.776 --> 19:37.344
Well, here's to
a long and prosperous

19:37.377 --> 19:38.880
beautiful partnership.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.882
Hear, hear.

19:49.891 --> 19:52.894
Laura, you have too much...

19:52.927 --> 19:54.629
too much paint on your brush.

19:54.662 --> 19:56.530
You need to paint
from the top-down.

20:03.004 --> 20:05.706
You know, if we were in London,
we could be in

20:05.740 --> 20:08.009
a nearly furnished
and freshly painted house.

20:08.042 --> 20:10.645
Yes, but we're not
in London and I'd...

20:10.678 --> 20:13.114
very much like to get this
finished before dinner,

20:13.147 --> 20:15.716
so that we can move
the bed back.

20:17.051 --> 20:19.486
We could pay it back later.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.989
And where would you sleep, pray?

20:47.014 --> 20:48.149
In that case.

20:52.787 --> 20:54.889
What? N-no.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.023
No.

20:56.057 --> 20:57.390
- No.
- No.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.558
- No.
- No.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.097
You said paint from
the top-down.

21:03.130 --> 21:05.833
Right, this is war.

21:05.867 --> 21:07.500
Come on.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.036
What are you two doing?

21:12.039 --> 21:14.809
War. This is war.

21:23.885 --> 21:25.620
You have such beautiful skin.

21:25.987 --> 21:27.587
Do I?

21:29.023 --> 21:30.925
Are you sure
we want to do this?

21:30.958 --> 21:32.960
Well...

21:32.994 --> 21:36.097
You can always take it off
if you don't like it.

21:50.678 --> 21:54.081
Jewish girls like me are always
at the bottom of the pile.

21:56.784 --> 21:59.519
Being a Pole,
it's like being even further.

22:01.022 --> 22:04.158
Some people's opinions
will simply never change.

22:07.028 --> 22:08.930
You can...

22:08.963 --> 22:10.865
put on the beautiful makeup,

22:11.999 --> 22:14.035
the clothes,

22:14.068 --> 22:15.970
the jewelry...

22:17.838 --> 22:19.506
and none of it matters.

22:22.743 --> 22:26.047
Unlike you and Robert,
my work...

22:26.080 --> 22:29.684
is always cut out for me.

22:31.953 --> 22:33.721
There.

22:38.159 --> 22:40.127
- Wow.
- Hello.

22:40.161 --> 22:42.196
Don't you two make a fine pair.

22:44.799 --> 22:46.167
Doesn't she look lovely?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.669
Yes, she does.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.674
Right.
Well, we are going shopping.

22:53.708 --> 22:54.942
Are we not? Indeed.

22:54.976 --> 22:56.777
I've, uh... I've fixed lunch.

22:56.811 --> 22:58.946
I can see. It's wonderful.

23:01.615 --> 23:04.151
Keep your father out of trouble.

23:04.185 --> 23:05.252
Bye.

23:05.286 --> 23:06.954
Save some.

23:10.291 --> 23:12.226
More food for us, huh?

23:12.259 --> 23:14.128
Alright.

25:31.966 --> 25:34.101
Where are you going?

25:34.135 --> 25:35.870
Robert.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.393
I love that
you kept your maiden name.

26:01.028 --> 26:04.098
I'm sure I know the answer,
but for fun,

26:04.131 --> 26:05.966
how did
Robert's parents take it?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.468
Oh, really well.

26:09.970 --> 26:12.139
The one thing his mother has
never forgiven me for, though

26:12.173 --> 26:15.209
is that Catherine took
my surname, Nicholson.

26:16.210 --> 26:19.013
Women will change
the world for the better.

26:19.046 --> 26:20.814
I tend to agree.

26:21.515 --> 26:24.285
We need to issue
a universal call to women.

26:25.186 --> 26:27.821
We assert our power as a source

26:27.855 --> 26:30.891
more meaningful than man,

26:30.925 --> 26:33.160
or meaningful than God.

27:24.845 --> 27:26.280
Thank you.

27:37.157 --> 27:39.093
Could you get that?

27:56.477 --> 27:58.379
You know there's plenty of room.

28:01.382 --> 28:04.084
I'll, uh...

28:04.118 --> 28:05.953
I'll be in the study.

28:26.307 --> 28:28.008
I brought you some tea.

28:47.895 --> 28:49.229
I hate the moon.

28:52.433 --> 28:55.569
And
I hate it worse when it's...

28:55.603 --> 28:57.605
cruel...

28:57.639 --> 29:00.107
and round and bright.

29:01.075 --> 29:04.378
You can't make out
the marks on its stupid face.

29:07.548 --> 29:10.517
You have the power
to understand...

29:11.619 --> 29:14.321
to forgive,

29:14.355 --> 29:16.023
to love,

29:16.056 --> 29:19.059
and that, more than anything,

29:19.093 --> 29:21.962
is what you should be putting
into your writing.

29:25.366 --> 29:28.435
And what does the remarkable
Miss Riding seek?

29:30.003 --> 29:32.339
I seek the truth...

29:33.173 --> 29:37.144
literally, without gloss,

29:37.177 --> 29:39.614
without any gloss.

29:41.348 --> 29:43.117
True poetry.

29:46.420 --> 29:48.623
And what is true poetry to you?

29:50.057 --> 29:55.129
True poetry makes
the hairs stand on end,

29:55.162 --> 29:58.999
turn to constrict

29:59.032 --> 30:01.535
and a shiver
to run down your spine.

30:17.284 --> 30:18.919
Sit with me.

30:33.768 --> 30:37.104
I think
it looks better like this.

30:40.775 --> 30:42.109
Yes.

30:43.377 --> 30:46.547
Yes, the... the...
the flow is much better.

30:46.580 --> 30:48.382
I want you to
do something for me.

30:50.217 --> 30:53.621
I want you
to write something here.

30:55.088 --> 30:57.157
The first thing
that comes to your mind.

31:05.767 --> 31:10.337
As I walked out of
that sultry, that...

31:12.506 --> 31:15.677
I heard the stroke of one.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.548
The moon

31:23.383 --> 31:26.754
attained to her full light

31:29.256 --> 31:32.292
still beaming like the sun,

31:36.497 --> 31:41.335
to mute the scent,

31:41.368 --> 31:46.073
of love's defeat,

31:51.144 --> 31:55.282
whose tryst

31:55.315 --> 31:57.518
had now begun.

32:26.113 --> 32:28.148
<i>I can't remember
exactly how I felt</i>

32:28.181 --> 32:30.450
<i>to see these two of you there.</i>

32:30.484 --> 32:33.520
<i>Relief? Hope?</i>

32:35.790 --> 32:38.325
<i>What I did know was
that I needed someone</i>

32:38.358 --> 32:41.228
<i>to share the heaviness
of our life together</i>

32:41.261 --> 32:44.565
<i>and here she was,
Laura Riding,</i>

32:44.598 --> 32:46.400
<i>our redeemer.</i>

32:47.534 --> 32:50.304
<i>Laura had become 100 times
more important to us</i>

32:50.337 --> 32:52.406
<i>than we had ever hoped and</i>

32:52.439 --> 32:55.342
<i>I couldn't remember a time
when she wasn't with us.</i>

33:00.581 --> 33:02.482
Thank you.

33:46.961 --> 33:49.329
Nice use of color.

33:51.331 --> 33:52.599
I'm going to try and sell it

33:52.634 --> 33:54.702
at the market at
the weekend in Oxford.

33:56.236 --> 33:58.438
Hopefully,
I get a good price for it.

34:03.577 --> 34:04.812
Is everything all right?

34:05.647 --> 34:07.280
Yes.

35:10.645 --> 35:13.447
Catherine,

35:13.480 --> 35:16.249
not many take kindly to people
going through their things.

35:17.451 --> 35:20.755
Let's save this for
when you're a bit older. Okay?

35:23.024 --> 35:24.926
Now...

35:24.959 --> 35:26.861
do you believe that some people
have magical powers?

35:26.894 --> 35:29.897
Yes, Miss Laura.

35:29.931 --> 35:33.500
That's how I knew
you were up here in my room.

35:38.572 --> 35:41.943
Let's see if you really believe.

35:41.976 --> 35:44.879
If you step out of this window,

35:44.912 --> 35:49.984
a magical staircase will come
and take you all the way down

35:50.017 --> 35:52.887
but only if you really believe.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.489
Do you believe in the staircase?

35:55.522 --> 35:58.358
I do, Miss Laura.

35:58.391 --> 35:59.493
Good girl.

36:00.762 --> 36:02.697
Now go on.

36:14.374 --> 36:15.509
<i>Go on.</i>

36:34.796 --> 36:36.998
I was just testing you.

36:37.031 --> 36:38.431
You did well.

36:38.465 --> 36:40.968
You believed in the staircase.

36:43.004 --> 36:44.371
But be careful.

36:45.405 --> 36:48.508
If we tell anybody
about our magic,

36:48.542 --> 36:50.845
policemen will come
and take us away.

36:51.879 --> 36:53.580
It's our secret.

36:54.615 --> 36:56.050
Yes?

36:56.617 --> 36:58.451
Good girl.

37:07.895 --> 37:10.064
I can't be dead!

37:10.097 --> 37:12.499
I won't be dead!

37:12.532 --> 37:14.401
Why?!

37:14.434 --> 37:16.403
Why am I dead?!

37:17.404 --> 37:19.339
Why?!

37:20.074 --> 37:23.044
I won't be dead!
I won't be dead!

37:23.077 --> 37:24.946
- Robert.
- Why?!

37:24.979 --> 37:27.682
Robert, listen to me.

37:27.715 --> 37:29.150
- Look at me.
- I'm alive.

37:29.183 --> 37:31.484
- I'm alive.
- Look at me.

37:34.521 --> 37:36.791
It's me. It's Laura.

37:36.824 --> 37:39.559
You're okay.

37:48.603 --> 37:51.172
- Daddy.
- It's all right.

37:51.205 --> 37:53.074
Daddy just had a bad dream.

38:00.815 --> 38:02.415
Laura.

38:02.449 --> 38:04.619
Laura, just stay with me.

38:21.468 --> 38:22.937
Robert's asleep.

38:22.970 --> 38:24.972
Finally.

38:26.140 --> 38:27.642
As is Catherine.

38:33.247 --> 38:35.049
What's this for?

38:36.784 --> 38:40.054
Mr. Broader commissioned
a female nude.

38:40.087 --> 38:42.056
Horny old turd.

38:43.658 --> 38:46.761
I don't know if
I'm happy with it though.

38:46.794 --> 38:48.595
I always tend to draw
the female form

38:48.629 --> 38:50.798
slightly plumper than it is.

40:15.616 --> 40:17.651
Can you lose the...

40:20.187 --> 40:21.956
Can you lose the curtain?

41:45.806 --> 41:46.941
Robert.

41:48.342 --> 41:49.610
What?

41:52.947 --> 41:54.949
You stayed
with me while I slept.

41:56.817 --> 41:59.753
I have, um,
written something for you.

42:01.689 --> 42:04.625
"Your phantom
wore the moon's cold mask,

42:05.759 --> 42:07.294
my phantom wore the same.

42:08.462 --> 42:11.265
Forgetful of the fevers
task in and hope of-

42:11.298 --> 42:15.970
which they can, each
image hold the other's eyes

42:17.271 --> 42:22.710
and watched a gray
distraction rise to cloud the...

42:23.277 --> 42:24.845
eager flame."

42:26.180 --> 42:27.781
Your Riding
is getting stronger.

42:29.283 --> 42:30.351
Clearer.

42:31.252 --> 42:33.921
I want you to be
everything... to me.

42:37.358 --> 42:38.659
And I to you.

42:40.060 --> 42:42.263
I wonder how
the limitless your devotion is.

43:01.148 --> 43:02.383
Is Robert a good lover?

43:06.287 --> 43:07.421
If he is,

43:08.489 --> 43:10.124
I don't bring it out in him.

43:14.795 --> 43:16.297
He's been through so much.

43:18.766 --> 43:20.434
He relies
on me for everything.

43:25.973 --> 43:27.374
I feel
like he's become a burden.

43:34.281 --> 43:36.183
You don't have
to bear that burden alone.

43:42.823 --> 43:44.091
Yes, our good friends.

43:58.005 --> 43:59.940
You're a rather
enviable man, Robert.

43:59.974 --> 44:01.442
And how is that?

44:01.475 --> 44:03.811
American women,
I understand, are very forward

44:03.844 --> 44:06.480
and experienced
in certain ways for them.

44:06.513 --> 44:08.249
Say what mean, man.

44:08.282 --> 44:09.917
Uh. Two women under one roof.

44:09.950 --> 44:12.386
No wonder you want
to be far from prying eyes

44:12.419 --> 44:14.488
of London, how do
you find time to write?

44:14.521 --> 44:17.491
Laura and I are
collaborators, nothing more.

44:17.524 --> 44:19.493
But she's a friend.

44:19.526 --> 44:22.029
- That's interesting.
- Graves, you're such a prick.

44:22.062 --> 44:23.330
Robert.

44:23.364 --> 44:25.466
Had you forgotten about me?

44:26.500 --> 44:30.070
Never. No. I was
just catching up with old chums.

44:31.438 --> 44:34.008
Isn't it fantastic to see
Robert in such good form?

44:34.041 --> 44:35.442
We were just discussing it.

44:37.111 --> 44:41.248
Mm. What gentlemen.

44:41.282 --> 44:42.816
English gentleman.

44:43.350 --> 44:45.786
Ms. Riding,
may I have a word in private?

44:46.487 --> 44:47.855
Be careful, Eliot.

44:52.259 --> 44:55.095
I understand you're looking
to get your book published.

44:55.462 --> 44:57.364
Yes. Yes.

44:57.398 --> 45:00.100
I'm looking forward to finding
somebody who understands

45:00.134 --> 45:02.336
and champions it
for everything that it is.

45:03.070 --> 45:05.339
Furnished me with more details,
perhaps I can help.

45:06.507 --> 45:10.311
Perhaps,
we could meet, later on.

45:11.211 --> 45:12.413
You could read me a chapter.

45:13.881 --> 45:15.215
I'm not staying
too far from you.

45:16.417 --> 45:18.185
Well, think about it.

45:20.521 --> 45:22.523
I'm so happy to see
you back on your feet.

45:22.556 --> 45:24.091
Your book will be a success.

45:24.124 --> 45:26.560
Our book, I owe it all to Laura.

45:26.593 --> 45:29.863
Right. Laura. Quite
the champion you are, Graves.

45:29.897 --> 45:33.133
Now, I've received a cable
from your old friend,

45:33.167 --> 45:34.902
- T.E Lawrence.
- How is he?

45:34.935 --> 45:36.537
- I think about him often.
- Quite well.

45:36.570 --> 45:38.572
A biography of his life
has been commissioned.

45:38.606 --> 45:41.643
T and I both agree:
you're the man for the job.

45:41.676 --> 45:43.911
It pays 300 pounds.

45:43.944 --> 45:46.547
Uh, I,
I don't know what to say.

45:46.580 --> 45:48.349
I have six weeks
to research and write, however,

45:48.382 --> 45:50.084
so you'd have
to write it here in London.

45:51.686 --> 45:53.987
- I-I accept.
- Wonderful.

45:56.123 --> 45:58.125
So long as
you publish The Closed Caplet?

45:59.393 --> 46:01.528
- Laura's book?
- Yes.

46:02.329 --> 46:04.431
Excuse me.

46:06.934 --> 46:08.869
...She's American.

46:10.170 --> 46:11.639
She must be
spectacular in bed.

46:11.673 --> 46:13.107
I mean, it's not her writing.

46:13.140 --> 46:15.042
What writing?

46:15.075 --> 46:17.077
Let's say I didn't mind her
ability to browbeat an audience

46:17.111 --> 46:18.979
into the convention for
she upholds a powering class.

46:19.513 --> 46:21.982
Laura's surely the maddest
woman I've ever met.

46:22.349 --> 46:24.451
As if Graves wasn't
already mad enough by extending

46:24.485 --> 46:26.220
an invitation to a woman
he's never met before?

46:26.253 --> 46:29.089
Laura Riding Roughshot.

46:30.157 --> 46:31.458
Real tougher.

46:31.492 --> 46:33.460
So Nancy.

46:45.973 --> 46:47.307
Laura.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.120
All right?

47:04.425 --> 47:06.126
Your friends don't respect me.

47:08.362 --> 47:10.030
Especially, TS Eliot.

47:11.231 --> 47:12.634
He's made it quite clear that

47:12.667 --> 47:16.170
he only wants
to help me... if I fuck him.

47:19.039 --> 47:20.708
Men can be quite disappointing.

47:22.509 --> 47:26.013
Although, perhaps
none more so than Louis.

47:27.548 --> 47:28.650
Who's Louis?

47:30.451 --> 47:32.052
My husband,

47:33.487 --> 47:36.190
he was a professor
at Cornell when I was there,

47:37.391 --> 47:40.594
tried to mould me
into a proper faculty wife.

47:41.261 --> 47:42.396
Huh.

47:44.799 --> 47:49.069
I make my own image,
nobody moulds me.

47:49.570 --> 47:51.238
I think you are extraordinary.

47:52.607 --> 47:53.974
You do?

48:01.315 --> 48:03.016
Yes.

48:08.188 --> 48:09.523
Storms always frightened me.

48:12.459 --> 48:13.628
It's different this time.

48:15.663 --> 48:18.499
As if we've been
singled out by some...

48:20.367 --> 48:21.669
supernatural powers.

48:23.370 --> 48:24.471
Don't you think?

48:53.333 --> 48:55.102
You don't have to rush.

49:10.517 --> 49:12.052
What?

49:13.788 --> 49:17.391
I've, uh, never been
naked in front of a woman.

49:20.527 --> 49:21.696
Not even Nancy?

49:44.318 --> 49:46.320
You do the rest.

50:46.948 --> 50:48.448
Good morning?

50:50.217 --> 50:51.318
Morning.

51:03.397 --> 51:04.531
What's the matter?

51:08.235 --> 51:09.971
I'm-I'm ashamed.

51:12.272 --> 51:13.407
Of what?

51:15.542 --> 51:17.411
I took advantage of you.

51:17.845 --> 51:20.414
I'm-I'm sorry.

51:22.582 --> 51:23.751
You didn't.

51:26.486 --> 51:27.554
I did.

51:29.891 --> 51:32.359
Don't be silly.

51:35.730 --> 51:37.364
I want you.

51:37.932 --> 51:39.701
You know that I want you.

51:43.037 --> 51:49.944
I want you physically...
emotionally, spiritually.

51:50.912 --> 51:52.412
Did I say physically?

52:01.689 --> 52:04.692
A book on
T.E. Lawrence and 300 pounds,

52:04.726 --> 52:06.027
Mm hm.

52:06.060 --> 52:07.929
Can't wait to reach London.

52:08.528 --> 52:09.764
Think about
all the possibilities.

52:10.631 --> 52:13.366
Well, I, I think
Catherine would hate it.

52:15.069 --> 52:18.271
and I-I'm not sure Nancy would
take well to the bad London air.

52:22.877 --> 52:24.511
Nancy is a marvelous woman.

52:26.080 --> 52:27.648
I feel very close to her.

52:30.017 --> 52:31.418
She's very fond of you.

52:35.890 --> 52:36.958
If she knew...

52:38.793 --> 52:39.894
She must never know.

52:43.798 --> 52:45.298
- Of course.
- No. No, no.

52:46.968 --> 52:48.502
I mean-I mean it.

52:52.572 --> 52:53.875
Of course.

52:54.709 --> 52:57.410
Daddy!
It's been so long I miss you.

52:57.444 --> 53:00.447
- Hello.
- Welcome home, oh!

53:02.683 --> 53:03.818
Welcome home.

53:05.585 --> 53:07.955
I trust the launch
party was a success.

53:07.989 --> 53:13.094
Yes, the early reviews are
very favorable and-oh and I-I

53:13.127 --> 53:15.362
was offered the job of writing
T.E. Lawrence's biography.

53:15.395 --> 53:17.430
- No! That's wonderful news.
- Thank you.

53:17.799 --> 53:23.971
And I-I trust
everything else was a success?

53:26.107 --> 53:28.075
Mm hm.

53:31.411 --> 53:34.081
I don't understand.

53:38.085 --> 53:40.121
Oh good Lord, bloody hell.

53:40.154 --> 53:42.857
<i>This meeting of minds
and bodies proved possible for</i>

53:42.890 --> 53:45.793
<i>three people to sustain a
modern relationship without any</i>

53:45.827 --> 53:48.930
<i>regard to the formal conventions
of society and I can't deny</i>

53:48.963 --> 53:52.700
<i>my happiness as we basked
in the glow of our trinity.</i>

53:52.733 --> 53:55.468
<i>Your demons
repulsed by Laura's influence.</i>

53:55.502 --> 53:56.771
Hello?

53:59.472 --> 54:00.708
Hello, Cape.

54:01.541 --> 54:05.012
Um, yes. And, um,
nearly, uh, nearly packed.

54:06.714 --> 54:09.817
No. No. Catherine
will stay here with Nancy.

54:13.587 --> 54:16.891
"Loving in part,
I did not see you home.

54:18.592 --> 54:22.663
The words I chose for your
voice to speak echoed my voice

54:22.964 --> 54:24.832
with its dry creek.

54:28.535 --> 54:33.875
Now that I love you, now
that I recall all the scattered

54:33.908 --> 54:37.979
elements of will that spooked
by night, this jealous dreams

54:38.012 --> 54:42.183
through windows
to circle above beds like bats."

54:45.019 --> 54:47.788
"Now that I love
you as not before,

54:49.190 --> 54:54.494
the mind clears,
to the heart true mercy."

54:56.631 --> 54:59.532
But at my side
an early watch you keep

55:00.968 --> 55:06.707
and all self
bruising heads lull to sleep."

55:12.479 --> 55:17.484
<i>Laura is a great natural
force like fire or trees</i>

55:18.585 --> 55:21.521
<i>or snow and either one
appreciates her or one doesn't.</i>

55:55.756 --> 55:56.991
Can I ask you a question?

55:59.627 --> 56:00.695
Mm hm.

56:04.699 --> 56:09.670
What is it that...
Laura does... to please you?

56:12.707 --> 56:14.809
What does
she do to make it better?

56:18.112 --> 56:20.513
I know she's beautiful.

56:20.547 --> 56:22.717
She's not just that.

56:32.059 --> 56:36.964
So it's a m-meeting of
minds and not just sex.

56:44.772 --> 56:46.273
I'm sorry if I
was a bit of a duff.

56:51.946 --> 56:53.014
Right.

56:55.683 --> 56:57.251
Well,
you must go to London,

56:59.120 --> 57:01.222
and lend your voice
to conversation.

57:07.361 --> 57:09.529
I have loved
being your inspiration...

57:16.670 --> 57:19.073
even if it was
just for a little while.

57:40.361 --> 57:41.729
- Hi.
- Hi.

57:42.296 --> 57:43.664
Call us when you get there.

57:43.697 --> 57:44.799
Oh yeah, yeah.

57:46.734 --> 57:48.102
I'll miss you very much.

57:51.272 --> 57:53.140
Thank you.

58:20.835 --> 58:22.203
We should go in.

58:52.066 --> 58:56.070
"I love, I'm not I.
I am my name.

58:56.103 --> 58:58.806
My name is not my name.

58:58.839 --> 59:00.307
My name is the name."

59:00.341 --> 59:02.009
Oh, wonderful.

59:03.010 --> 59:05.946
- Thank you.
- She's the new voice of poetry.

59:05.980 --> 59:07.114
Thank you.

59:07.148 --> 59:08.682
Wine!

59:11.719 --> 59:13.687
Don't you wanna dance?

59:13.721 --> 59:15.723
No thank you. I don't dance.

59:16.123 --> 59:19.226
Tell me, sir,
what are you after?

59:19.827 --> 59:21.795
You know, I would ask
you the very same question.

59:23.497 --> 59:25.866
We're a-actually thinking
of buying a printing press.

59:25.900 --> 59:27.368
Were going to control our work.

59:27.401 --> 59:30.938
Publish those
who we deem... important.

59:30.971 --> 59:32.740
As Laura says.

59:32.773 --> 59:34.341
If you're not going to
live with passion and creative

59:34.375 --> 59:36.911
instincts then you don't
belong in this new world.

59:36.944 --> 59:39.413
The aim is to provide an
alternative voice to all

59:39.446 --> 59:42.716
the stale writing that
is so prevalent these days.

59:44.218 --> 59:45.753
Would you publish me?

59:49.523 --> 59:51.892
Totally
unworthy of our attention.

59:55.529 --> 59:57.264
Congratulations
on Lawrence's book.

1:00:01.468 --> 1:00:02.736
Sir!

1:00:04.071 --> 1:00:05.940
Are you leaving already?

1:00:05.973 --> 1:00:07.775
Yes. Well, I think I've
seen and heard quite enough.

1:00:07.808 --> 1:00:10.110
We haven't even
had the chance to talk.

1:00:10.144 --> 1:00:11.312
Robert!

1:00:12.179 --> 1:00:15.716
Robert. Your master is calling.

1:00:17.818 --> 1:00:20.154
- Robert?
- Yes.

1:00:20.521 --> 1:00:23.757
This is-how was
it you say your name?

1:00:23.791 --> 1:00:25.759
- Elfriede.
- Hm.

1:00:26.060 --> 1:00:28.963
I thought she'd
be an excellent secretary.

1:00:28.996 --> 1:00:31.765
Ah, oh, well,
do you have any experience?

1:00:32.032 --> 1:00:33.467
A, a little. Yeah.

1:00:34.101 --> 1:00:35.336
Can you type?

1:00:36.136 --> 1:00:37.504
What's type?

1:00:37.538 --> 1:00:39.873
stenography.

1:00:47.514 --> 1:00:54.121
Fantastic. You're hired.
See, I can make everyone happy.

1:00:56.056 --> 1:00:58.792
Ah. Oh, fuck,
I'm so sorry madam.

1:00:58.826 --> 1:01:01.528
Ah. Here, let me-

1:01:01.562 --> 1:01:06.533
It's fine.
Oh. Are you the devil?

1:01:07.334 --> 1:01:08.402
I'm sorry?

1:01:08.435 --> 1:01:09.970
What's your name?

1:01:10.004 --> 1:01:12.306
Geoffrey. Geoffrey Phibbs.

1:01:12.339 --> 1:01:13.807
And who invited you?

1:01:13.841 --> 1:01:15.276
Uh, uh.

1:01:17.044 --> 1:01:19.413
Gate crasher. Spy!

1:01:19.446 --> 1:01:22.383
Please, please forgive
me for arriving uninvited.

1:01:22.416 --> 1:01:25.319
I actually just
came to see Laura Riding.

1:01:25.953 --> 1:01:27.888
Do you have any
idea where I may find her?

1:01:27.921 --> 1:01:29.990
- Laura Riding?
- Uh, uh.

1:01:30.024 --> 1:01:31.158
Give me your palm.

1:01:33.027 --> 1:01:36.230
You're not English, Scottish?

1:01:36.263 --> 1:01:37.965
Irish.

1:01:37.998 --> 1:01:41.235
Uh, look at these lines.
And what is it that you do?

1:01:41.268 --> 1:01:44.305
A poet,
or trying to be, if you may.

1:01:44.338 --> 1:01:46.340
And what is it
you want with Laura Riding?

1:01:46.974 --> 1:01:50.411
Well, I read her latest
essay in magazine

1:01:50.444 --> 1:01:52.913
and it's changed my life.

1:01:52.946 --> 1:01:54.882
Maybe you can introduce me.

1:01:56.583 --> 1:02:00.587
Listen up everybody,
this is Geoffrey Phibbs.

1:02:03.223 --> 1:02:05.859
He wants to meet Laura Riding.

1:02:07.261 --> 1:02:09.363
Should I introduce them?

1:02:09.396 --> 1:02:11.098
Yes!

1:02:11.532 --> 1:02:13.133
Bite.

1:02:16.470 --> 1:02:21.141
Geoff! Geoff! Geoff!

1:02:26.914 --> 1:02:31.185
Laura Riding,
pleasure to meet you.

1:02:31.218 --> 1:02:32.886
Go on, shake my hand.

1:02:49.036 --> 1:02:50.337
Good morning.

1:02:50.371 --> 1:02:51.872
What's the matter?

1:02:52.339 --> 1:02:54.942
Have you read
Elliot's review of my essay?

1:02:54.975 --> 1:02:56.243
No.

1:02:56.276 --> 1:02:57.612
He calls my
arguments derivative.

1:02:57.645 --> 1:02:59.947
- What?
- How dare he?

1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:01.548
And yet I'm not surprised.

1:03:01.582 --> 1:03:04.251
Oh, I had a feeling he would
do something like this.

1:03:05.486 --> 1:03:07.521
Well, don't make a meal of it.

1:03:08.122 --> 1:03:10.457
I just can't believe that he-
he'd compromise our friendship

1:03:10.491 --> 1:03:12.559
- by writing such nonsense.
- Bah.

1:03:13.661 --> 1:03:15.663
Don't let it bother you.
We have so much planned.

1:03:16.497 --> 1:03:18.633
It doesn't matter
what they say one jot.

1:03:18.666 --> 1:03:21.001
Where are you off to?

1:03:21.034 --> 1:03:24.972
Oh, Cape has been screaming
at me to finish my short

1:03:25.005 --> 1:03:27.241
stories,
so I'd better get to it.

1:03:27.274 --> 1:03:28.442
Will I read
it once you're done?

1:03:28.475 --> 1:03:30.344
Oh no, there's no need.

1:03:30.377 --> 1:03:32.446
Elfriede has been typing it up
and running it over as we go

1:03:32.479 --> 1:03:35.482
along, so I'm... I'm sure it will
be up to our joint standards.

1:03:36.116 --> 1:03:38.485
She has a nice body.

1:03:39.286 --> 1:03:40.554
She's attracted to you.

1:03:41.088 --> 1:03:44.491
Well, I don't
see anyone but you.

1:03:45.559 --> 1:03:47.461
Hm.

1:03:47.494 --> 1:03:51.031
Oh, he's here. Can you answer
the door while I get dressed?

1:03:51.064 --> 1:03:53.233
- Who's here?
- Geoffrey.

1:03:56.236 --> 1:03:58.138
You know,
from the party.

1:03:58.673 --> 1:04:00.407
The young poet. Irishman.

1:04:00.441 --> 1:04:02.142
- Ah, Yes.
- He's coming to stay with us.

1:04:04.511 --> 1:04:06.447
Why?

1:04:10.284 --> 1:04:12.052
There.

1:04:12.085 --> 1:04:14.722
Right.

1:04:17.291 --> 1:04:19.960
A collection
of Poems from Ezra Pound.

1:04:22.697 --> 1:04:24.097
Next.

1:04:26.701 --> 1:04:28.235
It's Robert Frost.

1:04:30.471 --> 1:04:32.005
That's fine.

1:04:34.308 --> 1:04:36.076
Ah.

1:04:36.109 --> 1:04:37.578
T.S. Eliot.

1:04:38.145 --> 1:04:39.446
Mm hm.

1:04:40.782 --> 1:04:42.750
It's a pity, such a nice man.

1:04:42.784 --> 1:04:44.384
Give it to me.

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:48.522
Geoffrey, these books
that have passed muster,

1:04:48.555 --> 1:04:51.225
they are now the common
property of Size and Press,

1:04:51.258 --> 1:04:53.026
we'll add them to our library.

1:04:53.060 --> 1:04:54.762
I'm sorry, what-
what's Size and Press?

1:04:54.796 --> 1:04:57.699
Size and Press
is the name of our new company,

1:04:58.465 --> 1:05:01.568
where only the most interesting
voices will be heard.

1:05:01.602 --> 1:05:03.337
- Right.
- And now that we've dealt with

1:05:03.370 --> 1:05:05.472
your books, we should
address your clothing.

1:05:05.506 --> 1:05:07.207
What about my clothing?

1:05:07.241 --> 1:05:09.142
Well, it must be burned
with the rest of these.

1:05:13.347 --> 1:05:16.383
Let's start with your shirt.

1:05:31.164 --> 1:05:32.834
You know, Geoffrey, I think
our first assignment should

1:05:32.867 --> 1:05:35.168
be a dictionary
of exact meanings.

1:05:35.536 --> 1:05:37.204
Exact meanings?

1:05:37.237 --> 1:05:39.206
Yes. One word, one definition.

1:05:39.239 --> 1:05:41.542
That was meant
to be our next project.

1:05:41.575 --> 1:05:43.778
So one definition
for every word.

1:05:44.444 --> 1:05:48.115
Um, that doesn't
make any sense.

1:05:48.148 --> 1:05:53.287
Well, consider the word 'woman',
which is derived from wifmon,

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:57.190
a non-male,
a-a female man, as it were.

1:05:57.224 --> 1:05:59.393
An arbitrary
term without defining,

1:05:59.426 --> 1:06:03.297
a thing perceived amongst
other things such as a horse,

1:06:03.330 --> 1:06:04.531
a cat, a dog.

1:06:05.165 --> 1:06:07.200
Shall we have a toast?

1:06:07.234 --> 1:06:08.535
I'll explain
more in the morning.

1:06:14.642 --> 1:06:18.211
To the holy circle,
a new literary group.

1:06:28.589 --> 1:06:32.559
"Beware, madam,
of the witty devil,

1:06:34.227 --> 1:06:39.701
the arch intriguer who walks
disguised in a poet's cloak,

1:06:41.435 --> 1:06:44.839
his gay tongue oozing evil."

1:06:45.405 --> 1:06:46.473
Let's see.

1:06:47.675 --> 1:06:50.310
"Would you be a muse?"

1:06:51.813 --> 1:06:57.384
"He will so declare you,
pledging his blind allegiance,

1:06:57.417 --> 1:07:00.722
yet remained
secret and uncommitted.

1:07:02.522 --> 1:07:07.762
Poets are men, are
single-hearted lovers who adore

1:07:07.795 --> 1:07:10.330
and trust beyond all reason,

1:07:11.799 --> 1:07:15.302
who die
honorably at the gates of hell.

1:07:18.673 --> 1:07:24.712
The muse alone is licensed
to do murder and to betray.

1:07:26.681 --> 1:07:28.548
Weeping with honest tears,

1:07:28.850 --> 1:07:31.218
she thrones
each victim...

1:07:32.519 --> 1:07:33.821
in her...

1:07:35.555 --> 1:07:36.724
paradise."

1:07:38.358 --> 1:07:39.861
I think you need a break.

1:07:42.830 --> 1:07:44.264
Where is Robert?

1:07:46.801 --> 1:07:47.969
He went out for the evening.

1:08:00.815 --> 1:08:02.884
This has never
happened to me before.

1:08:04.284 --> 1:08:08.923
You just need to relax.

1:08:08.956 --> 1:08:10.792
Yeah.

1:08:11.793 --> 1:08:14.696
It's all about willpower.

1:08:16.864 --> 1:08:18.866
You see
that clock over there?

1:08:20.868 --> 1:08:22.602
Look.

1:08:25.740 --> 1:08:30.444
I can will it to stop
if I want to.

1:09:08.415 --> 1:09:10.417
Geoffrey.

1:09:22.562 --> 1:09:27.400
<i>Nancy...
how I've missed you.</i>

1:09:28.335 --> 1:09:31.806
<i>Our time apart
has been far too long.</i>

1:09:32.472 --> 1:09:36.510
<i>You simply must bring Catherine
to London to pay us a visit.</i>

1:09:37.712 --> 1:09:40.047
<i>She will enjoy the city,</i>

1:09:40.081 --> 1:09:43.017
<i>and Robert will
be happy to see you both.</i>

1:09:44.685 --> 1:09:47.088
<i>Not as happy as I will be</i>

1:09:47.121 --> 1:09:51.726
<i>to have us all reunited...
together.</i>

1:09:56.964 --> 1:09:58.766
Oh!

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:02.502
- Finally up.
- Ah, good morning.

1:10:02.536 --> 1:10:05.773
We're going to have visitors
today, so you should

1:10:05.807 --> 1:10:08.408
- get yourself together.
- What visitors?

1:10:08.441 --> 1:10:10.044
Mmm.

1:10:10.077 --> 1:10:11.946
- What...
- Too late.

1:10:11.979 --> 1:10:14.048
Train was on time.

1:10:17.785 --> 1:10:20.788
Hello!
Nancy, this is, um-

1:10:20.822 --> 1:10:22.790
this is our new friend,
Geoffrey Phibbs.

1:10:22.824 --> 1:10:24.357
He's a very
talented young poet,

1:10:25.458 --> 1:10:27.327
and he's been living here
with us.

1:10:27.829 --> 1:10:29.362
How do you do?

1:10:29.831 --> 1:10:33.366
Geoffrey, this-
this is my wife and my daughter.

1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:34.836
- Where is she?
- Catherine,

1:10:34.869 --> 1:10:36.737
- say hello to Geoffrey.
- Hello.

1:10:36.771 --> 1:10:38.371
She's shy.

1:10:38.806 --> 1:10:40.808
You aren't
going to say anything?

1:10:40.842 --> 1:10:42.677
I think he's in shock.

1:10:42.710 --> 1:10:45.412
Right, well, we were on that
train for ever such a long time.

1:10:45.445 --> 1:10:46.948
I think Catherine might need
to stretch her legs.

1:10:46.981 --> 1:10:48.916
Catherine, come with me.
To the park we go.

1:10:49.650 --> 1:10:51.384
Geoffrey, would you-
would you like to join us?

1:10:51.418 --> 1:10:54.055
Um, yes,
certainly.

1:10:54.088 --> 1:10:56.556
- Uh, I'll just follow you out.
- Very well.

1:11:03.563 --> 1:11:07.034
Hello.
I missed you.

1:11:08.970 --> 1:11:11.672
Oh... Nancy, no.

1:11:12.173 --> 1:11:16.010
No, uh,
I'm not that way.

1:11:16.043 --> 1:11:17.912
Robert needs you.

1:11:17.945 --> 1:11:20.681
You have to focus all your
energy on Robert right now.

1:11:23.583 --> 1:11:26.486
Yes.
Yes, of course.

1:11:26.519 --> 1:11:27.855
Hmm.

1:11:43.905 --> 1:11:45.840
Meet our champion drinker.

1:11:45.873 --> 1:11:48.209
What can I say, Robert,
I'm Irish.

1:11:50.211 --> 1:11:52.780
It's not the only thing
he's good at.

1:11:53.546 --> 1:11:55.616
Mmm!

1:12:08.162 --> 1:12:10.765
Oof!

1:12:10.798 --> 1:12:13.968
Dance with me.
Dance with me. Dance with me.

1:12:29.083 --> 1:12:32.019
Be careful with her, Robert.

1:13:02.750 --> 1:13:07.121
Uh... thank you
for a splendid evening.

1:13:07.554 --> 1:13:09.023
What?

1:13:09.056 --> 1:13:11.158
Goodnight.

1:13:19.566 --> 1:13:21.635
Not tonight.

1:13:39.620 --> 1:13:41.222
<i>A modern relationship
without any regard</i>

1:13:41.255 --> 1:13:44.258
<i>for formal conventions.</i>

1:13:44.291 --> 1:13:46.660
<i>Could I have been
so blind, Robert?</i>

1:13:47.194 --> 1:13:50.631
<i>I decided that evening
to chart my own course.</i>

1:13:50.664 --> 1:13:54.668
<i>As you know, matters took
a more... complicated turn,</i>

1:13:54.702 --> 1:13:56.670
if that was even possible.

1:14:07.181 --> 1:14:08.883
Permission to come aboard.

1:14:08.916 --> 1:14:12.119
Hello.
Permission granted.

1:14:12.853 --> 1:14:14.989
I heard you were living here,

1:14:15.022 --> 1:14:17.091
wanted to see
how you're getting on.

1:14:17.124 --> 1:14:21.062
Look at this!
I like it, it's lovely.

1:14:22.196 --> 1:14:24.965
Uh, do you need any help?

1:14:24.999 --> 1:14:28.803
Yes, um, perhaps that box
because I need it.

1:14:32.173 --> 1:14:34.075
- Dublin.
- Pardon?

1:14:34.775 --> 1:14:37.311
- Have you ever been?
- No.

1:14:37.344 --> 1:14:39.380
Uh, you should go.

1:14:39.413 --> 1:14:42.650
There's plenty of things
for you to paint over there.

1:14:43.684 --> 1:14:46.053
I'll bear that in mind.

1:14:46.087 --> 1:14:47.721
You're very good,
by the way.

1:14:47.755 --> 1:14:50.191
Oh, thank you.

1:14:52.326 --> 1:14:55.296
So how's your writing coming
along, are you a poet yet?

1:14:55.329 --> 1:14:59.166
Uh...
I don't know if I am a poet.

1:15:00.101 --> 1:15:03.838
My own verses have earned me
nothing but rejection slips.

1:15:04.371 --> 1:15:07.241
And besides, I have been
working on a dictionary.

1:15:07.274 --> 1:15:09.009
- A dictionary? Oh!
- Mm-hmm!

1:15:09.043 --> 1:15:11.879
But only words with exact
meanings would be included.

1:15:11.912 --> 1:15:14.281
Are you up to the challenge?

1:15:14.315 --> 1:15:19.386
Uh, I feel like Laura's
just using me like a pencil.

1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:21.055
I'm sure.

1:15:22.723 --> 1:15:23.991
Your husband

1:15:24.024 --> 1:15:25.759
- is an extraordinary writer.
- Yes.

1:15:25.793 --> 1:15:27.294
I've learned a great deal
from him.

1:15:27.328 --> 1:15:28.829
I thought Laura was your mentor?

1:15:29.263 --> 1:15:32.366
Well, she is, but I consider
Robert my friend as well.

1:15:32.399 --> 1:15:34.435
Well,
Laura finds you acceptable,

1:15:34.468 --> 1:15:36.337
you'll be Robert's best friend.

1:15:36.370 --> 1:15:38.873
She and Robert are very close...

1:15:40.841 --> 1:15:43.644
- ...collaborators.
- Lovers.

1:15:48.349 --> 1:15:50.351
I could use a shot of whiskey.

1:15:50.384 --> 1:15:52.920
Well, I can help you with that.

1:15:54.255 --> 1:15:57.358
- Oh, we go.
- Well equipped.

1:15:57.391 --> 1:15:59.960
Tea cups.
Not fancy here.

1:15:59.994 --> 1:16:02.396
Thank you.

1:16:03.364 --> 1:16:05.699
Here we are.

1:16:07.401 --> 1:16:09.170
To you.

1:16:09.203 --> 1:16:11.005
To your new home.

1:16:15.843 --> 1:16:17.678
Mmm.

1:16:19.180 --> 1:16:22.016
You know, Robert
does miss you, and Catherine.

1:16:22.049 --> 1:16:25.719
I'm sure he does,
but Robert needs his space

1:16:25.753 --> 1:16:28.155
and Laura's the only one allowed
to fill it at the moment.

1:16:28.189 --> 1:16:30.291
You know,
we're not too far.

1:16:32.059 --> 1:16:34.295
Perhaps this is all my fault
anyway,

1:16:34.929 --> 1:16:36.997
but I encouraged it.

1:16:37.031 --> 1:16:39.733
He was struggling
and we invited Laura

1:16:39.767 --> 1:16:43.204
to come and stay,
and she woke him up.

1:16:45.472 --> 1:16:48.909
You're also very honest
with each other?

1:16:48.943 --> 1:16:51.245
I wonder if the word honesty
has an exact meaning.

1:16:51.278 --> 1:16:54.915
Yes.

1:17:03.190 --> 1:17:05.292
- Davidoff for you, sir.
- Thank you.

1:17:05.926 --> 1:17:08.429
Well, I've been thinking, since
the release of the Lorentz book,

1:17:09.129 --> 1:17:11.232
interest in the Great War
has never been higher.

1:17:11.799 --> 1:17:13.200
You should consider writing

1:17:13.234 --> 1:17:14.969
about your experiences
on the front.

1:17:15.002 --> 1:17:16.503
London is working
on a memo I sold.

1:17:16.537 --> 1:17:18.138
If I write another book,

1:17:18.172 --> 1:17:20.174
it would take place
in Ancient Rome.

1:17:20.507 --> 1:17:24.878
Murder, mystery, intrigue,
violence, sex. You know.

1:17:24.912 --> 1:17:26.780
Yes, of course.
Well, you're right about that.

1:17:26.814 --> 1:17:29.183
I'm sure it would
be a bestseller, but...

1:17:29.883 --> 1:17:32.052
...I believe
that you could write something

1:17:32.086 --> 1:17:35.089
memorable and meaningful
for the people of this country.

1:17:35.990 --> 1:17:37.825
Give it some thought.

1:17:40.027 --> 1:17:43.364
So... you're enjoying the money
from the Lorentz book.

1:17:44.398 --> 1:17:45.933
Thank you.

1:17:46.900 --> 1:17:49.336
<i>The success you craved
was at hand.</i>

1:17:49.370 --> 1:17:51.939
<i>It's a funny life,
isn't it?</i>

1:17:52.439 --> 1:17:54.208
<i>Your exiled yourself
to a private world</i>

1:17:54.241 --> 1:17:56.844
<i>in which Laura
was the only authority.</i>

1:17:56.877 --> 1:17:58.879
<i>The more she failed
at her writing,</i>

1:17:58.912 --> 1:18:00.481
<i>the more you
devoted yourself to her.</i>

1:18:00.514 --> 1:18:03.183
<i>Love did blind you Robert.</i>

1:18:07.622 --> 1:18:10.457
<i>As you wrote to me
during our courtship,</i>

1:18:10.491 --> 1:18:12.860
<i>when a dream is born in you</i>

1:18:12.893 --> 1:18:15.129
<i>and you wish
the dream to be true,</i>

1:18:15.162 --> 1:18:18.032
<i>be careful though
with sudden clutch.</i>

1:18:18.999 --> 1:18:22.136
<i>You'll hurt the delicate
things you prize so much.</i>

1:18:22.169 --> 1:18:26.307
Aw. Right, here we go.

1:18:26.340 --> 1:18:27.975
Hm!

1:18:28.008 --> 1:18:30.010
Shouldn't you be
getting back to work right now?

1:18:30.044 --> 1:18:33.514
Ah, such a nice day!
Why waste it with work, eh?

1:18:35.249 --> 1:18:38.118
So, I have hidden
a ball somewhere on this barge.

1:18:38.152 --> 1:18:41.623
If you can find it
in the time allocated,

1:18:41.656 --> 1:18:44.892
there will be a special
treat in store for you.

1:18:44.925 --> 1:18:47.061
Go, go find it.

1:18:49.596 --> 1:18:51.231
You're wonderful with that.

1:18:51.265 --> 1:18:52.933
Oh.

1:18:52.966 --> 1:18:55.269
I wish I didn't have to leave.

1:18:57.604 --> 1:19:00.642
Laura's being so aggressive.

1:19:00.675 --> 1:19:03.143
She's always
expecting something from me.

1:19:03.177 --> 1:19:05.212
Then assert yourself. Say no.

1:19:07.314 --> 1:19:09.416
I think I should
go back to Dublin.

1:19:09.450 --> 1:19:12.086
My father keeps
asking me to come home.

1:19:12.119 --> 1:19:14.088
What's keeping you here?

1:19:15.923 --> 1:19:17.524
I wish it were that simple.

1:19:19.927 --> 1:19:24.098
Besides,
I enjoy our afternoons together

1:19:24.131 --> 1:19:27.968
more than anything,
as brief as they are.

1:19:32.539 --> 1:19:34.441
Don't try your odds on me.

1:19:35.943 --> 1:19:37.511
You're most attractive.

1:19:40.114 --> 1:19:42.216
I find you
attractive as.

1:19:42.249 --> 1:19:43.917
Right, stop that.

1:19:45.552 --> 1:19:49.156
I can't be a continuous
player in this drama.

1:19:50.124 --> 1:19:53.460
I won, I found the ball, yay!

1:20:11.578 --> 1:20:13.981
Nancy is trying
to destroy the holy circle.

1:20:14.014 --> 1:20:15.549
Holy circle.

1:20:15.582 --> 1:20:17.619
I just came here to see
if Geoffrey was all right.

1:20:17.652 --> 1:20:19.520
- Where's Catherine?
- She's at your sister's.

1:20:19.553 --> 1:20:21.522
And as for this holy circle,
I want nothing to do with it.

1:20:21.555 --> 1:20:23.223
- Do you understand?
- Could one of you please

1:20:23.257 --> 1:20:24.726
enlighten me
as to what this is all about?

1:20:24.759 --> 1:20:27.060
Nancy has been
poisoning his mind against me.

1:20:27.094 --> 1:20:28.630
I know the two of you
have been spending

1:20:28.663 --> 1:20:30.330
an awful lot of time together.

1:20:30.364 --> 1:20:32.232
I see everything.
Everything. Nothing escapes me.

1:20:32.266 --> 1:20:34.034
She's probably just running
an errand or something.

1:20:34.067 --> 1:20:36.570
Oh, don't be an idiot.
You know, this is your fault.

1:20:36.603 --> 1:20:38.305
- My fault?
- Exactly.

1:20:38.338 --> 1:20:40.240
If you were spending
enough time with your wife,

1:20:40.274 --> 1:20:42.476
then I could be in bed
with Geoffrey right now...

1:20:42.509 --> 1:20:45.112
Oh, don't you dare
pass judgment on my marriage.

1:20:45.546 --> 1:20:48.348
If either of you had
actually spoken to Geoffrey,

1:20:48.382 --> 1:20:50.551
you'd realize that he's deeply
unhappy and he wants to

1:20:50.584 --> 1:20:52.654
- go back to Dublin.
- Find him.

1:20:52.687 --> 1:20:55.322
Find him? But where exactly
do you propose I start looking?

1:20:55.355 --> 1:20:57.491
I don't fucking know,
but why don't you start?

1:20:57.524 --> 1:20:59.426
Find him.

1:20:59.460 --> 1:21:01.462
This is a mess.

1:21:01.495 --> 1:21:03.597
- ...back in the morning-
- She's mad.

1:21:03.631 --> 1:21:05.999
If I either of you
had bothered to talk...

1:21:07.769 --> 1:21:09.403
I'll be back shortly.

1:21:23.217 --> 1:21:24.451
Just me.

1:21:29.356 --> 1:21:31.124
I've just come
to collect my things.

1:21:32.226 --> 1:21:35.162
I'm gonna be staying
with my auntie in Putney.

1:21:35.195 --> 1:21:37.097
You caused quite the commotion.

1:21:41.568 --> 1:21:43.303
Where's Laura and Robert?

1:21:45.339 --> 1:21:48.275
Well, Robert
went out to look for you

1:21:49.309 --> 1:21:54.716
and Laura locked herself
in her bathroom eight hours ago.

1:21:59.353 --> 1:22:01.188
Maybe I should talk to her.

1:22:02.624 --> 1:22:05.760
Laura, you're a very
strong-minded woman.

1:22:07.227 --> 1:22:11.565
You ask me to give up
everything to come here

1:22:11.598 --> 1:22:13.467
and work with you.

1:22:13.835 --> 1:22:16.771
You then enticed me
into your bed and...

1:22:17.471 --> 1:22:20.340
...I hate it.
I hate it.

1:22:21.141 --> 1:22:23.845
I-I hate it because I feel that
I'm in between the two of you

1:22:23.878 --> 1:22:25.479
in a way that I don't...

1:22:25.512 --> 1:22:28.115
and I suspect Robert
doesn't even understand.

1:22:28.716 --> 1:22:32.152
Laura brought you
out of ob-obscurity.

1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:35.255
And-And this is how
you repay her?

1:22:35.723 --> 1:22:37.090
By leaving?

1:22:38.191 --> 1:22:40.762
Do you have
no sense of her holiness?

1:22:40.795 --> 1:22:43.130
Who do you think she is?
The fucking pope?

1:22:43.163 --> 1:22:44.666
- A goddess!
- Robert, Geoffrey,

1:22:44.699 --> 1:22:47.100
- this isn't helping.
- What I know is this bastard

1:22:47.134 --> 1:22:49.336
has turned up out of nowhere
and spoiled everything!

1:22:49.871 --> 1:22:52.172
He's a selfish prick
who'd prefer to run back

1:22:52.205 --> 1:22:53.775
to his beloved island
than stay with us!

1:22:53.808 --> 1:22:56.209
I prefer to be with
neither you nor Laura,

1:22:56.243 --> 1:22:57.845
if the truth be told.

1:22:57.879 --> 1:23:00.748
If any here deserves
any consideration, it's Nancy.

1:23:00.782 --> 1:23:04.619
She's the only honest,
understanding person here,

1:23:04.652 --> 1:23:07.187
which makes my decision to
leave all the more difficult.

1:23:07.220 --> 1:23:09.256
You're a liar and a sponger!

1:23:09.289 --> 1:23:10.825
You couldn't give
a damn about Nancy!

1:23:10.858 --> 1:23:13.460
And more to the point,
she doesn't care about you!

1:23:13.493 --> 1:23:14.696
Ask her.

1:23:25.707 --> 1:23:27.240
You're fucking lying.

1:23:27.274 --> 1:23:30.377
Robert, for God's sake,
can't you see?

1:23:30.410 --> 1:23:33.580
First, Laura wanted you,
now she wants me.

1:23:33.615 --> 1:23:38.185
To have me,
to posses me, to-to-to fuck me!

1:23:38.218 --> 1:23:39.654
She thinks she's God.

1:23:39.687 --> 1:23:42.189
Stay away from her
before she destroys you.

1:23:42.222 --> 1:23:44.424
I will kill you.
I'll kill you.

1:23:44.458 --> 1:23:46.661
Robert, Robert, no
don't, don't, Geoffrey.

1:23:46.694 --> 1:23:48.863
Bloody, mental Robert.

1:23:48.896 --> 1:23:50.865
Stop it! Robert, stop it!

1:23:50.898 --> 1:23:52.432
Get off him.

1:23:53.801 --> 1:23:56.771
Laura, help me! Get off him!

1:24:03.945 --> 1:24:05.813
Goodbye, chaps.

1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:08.181
Laura!

1:24:10.350 --> 1:24:12.486
Laura!

1:24:22.429 --> 1:24:26.233
Hello, Windsor?
I need an ambulance.

1:24:26.266 --> 1:24:28.770
Yes, 3580 Square

1:24:49.389 --> 1:24:51.693
<i>He's been doing
so well, so well.</i>

1:24:51.726 --> 1:24:53.360
<i>Catherine!</i>

1:24:53.393 --> 1:24:55.730
<i>What are we going
to do about Robert?</i>

1:24:55.763 --> 1:24:57.632
<i>His fight is his own front.</i>

1:24:57.665 --> 1:25:01.301
<i>It's the only place for
a true gentleman.</i>

1:25:03.303 --> 1:25:06.607
<i>I was left for dead
during the Battle of the Somme.</i>

1:25:07.574 --> 1:25:10.310
<i>As a shell splinted my lungs,</i>

1:25:11.545 --> 1:25:15.750
<i>and so they marked me
dead the day I turned 21.</i>

1:25:17.652 --> 1:25:20.587
<i>They counted me
as dead, did they?</i>

1:25:21.956 --> 1:25:24.659
<i>The day my childhood
slipped away,</i>

1:25:26.627 --> 1:25:28.528
<i>and manhood begun.</i>

1:25:31.298 --> 1:25:32.867
Robert!

1:25:39.807 --> 1:25:41.441
He's badly bruised,

1:25:41.475 --> 1:25:43.644
but he seems to have
escaped serious injury.

1:25:45.412 --> 1:25:47.715
It's a different story
with the American woman.

1:25:49.382 --> 1:25:53.788
Her spine are not broken,
suffered a severe contortion.

1:25:53.821 --> 1:25:57.491
I must emphasize that
the spinal cord is intact

1:25:57.524 --> 1:26:00.393
which means that
paralysis is unlikely.

1:26:01.062 --> 1:26:04.598
We'll be performing
surgery to relieve the pressure,

1:26:04.632 --> 1:26:07.902
and afterwards, she'll need
long period of convalescence.

1:26:08.703 --> 1:26:10.638
I'm afraid that's all
I can say at this time.

1:26:11.404 --> 1:26:14.274
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1:26:18.345 --> 1:26:19.546
Thank you.

1:26:29.123 --> 1:26:31.859
The police had
to question Mr. Graves,

1:26:31.893 --> 1:26:36.596
and charges of attempted murder
are expected to be forthcoming.

1:26:36.631 --> 1:26:40.935
Hm. There is more
Ms. Riding with Mary

1:26:40.968 --> 1:26:42.302
before she arrived in England.

1:26:43.004 --> 1:26:45.372
"And allegations
of untoward behavior

1:26:45.405 --> 1:26:47.474
with an American professor

1:26:47.507 --> 1:26:50.577
who's been forced
to resign his position."

1:26:50.611 --> 1:26:51.879
Oh, Robert.

1:26:52.947 --> 1:26:56.884
You are very excellent
and truthful person

1:26:57.919 --> 1:26:59.553
drowning in a quagmire.

1:27:26.881 --> 1:27:28.448
Hello?

1:27:31.752 --> 1:27:33.087
Where is Catherine?

1:27:34.188 --> 1:27:35.990
She's still at her aunt's.

1:27:36.023 --> 1:27:37.490
Right.

1:27:37.524 --> 1:27:38.960
And I'll take her
back to World's End.

1:27:42.630 --> 1:27:45.132
What must she think?

1:27:48.468 --> 1:27:50.938
Can't choose your parents,
can you?

1:27:50.972 --> 1:27:52.372
Don't.

1:27:53.107 --> 1:27:55.009
Don't say that.

1:27:55.910 --> 1:27:58.079
You've done
a wonderful job with her.

1:28:02.884 --> 1:28:04.384
Listen.

1:28:06.486 --> 1:28:08.055
I want to stay.

1:28:10.925 --> 1:28:13.426
I want to help you
raise Catherine.

1:28:14.128 --> 1:28:15.528
If you'll let me.

1:28:33.114 --> 1:28:34.514
Yes.

1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:55.069
How are you?

1:28:55.903 --> 1:28:57.504
Tired.

1:29:02.009 --> 1:29:05.478
- How is Catherine?
- Fine. She's fine.

1:29:06.614 --> 1:29:09.016
I told her
you went on holiday.

1:29:09.050 --> 1:29:10.918
I didn't know what else to say.

1:29:13.254 --> 1:29:15.723
I need to get
Catherine back to World's End.

1:29:15.756 --> 1:29:18.525
We are going to leave
the day after tomorrow.

1:29:18.558 --> 1:29:20.027
Geoffrey going with you?

1:29:20.061 --> 1:29:21.494
He is.

1:29:30.705 --> 1:29:32.907
I did not deny

1:29:35.009 --> 1:29:37.745
anything about
how good we were together.

1:29:42.683 --> 1:29:45.552
And Catherine proves it,
we were good.

1:29:45.585 --> 1:29:46.854
Hm.

1:29:52.293 --> 1:29:54.228
Was it all worth it?

1:30:02.837 --> 1:30:04.604
I almost loved her.

1:30:06.707 --> 1:30:08.275
I never worshiped her.

1:30:15.816 --> 1:30:17.251
I made you something

1:30:18.986 --> 1:30:22.089
so that you would always
have Catherine near you.

1:30:25.726 --> 1:30:28.029
Has her dress and her bonnet
and the curls on her head

1:30:28.062 --> 1:30:30.698
and I'm sure
it has her kind heart.

1:30:36.670 --> 1:30:39.273
You are a great writer,

1:30:42.643 --> 1:30:44.845
with or without Laura Riding.

1:31:04.832 --> 1:31:07.902
I haven't had the
courage to look at myself yet.

1:31:09.737 --> 1:31:11.205
There's a mirror in there.

1:31:13.641 --> 1:31:15.076
Will you get it?

1:31:18.012 --> 1:31:19.080
Sure.

1:31:41.102 --> 1:31:42.670
Put it away.

1:31:45.773 --> 1:31:47.908
Oh, what have I done?

1:31:57.852 --> 1:32:00.988
There's usually
a staircase that takes me away.

1:32:03.891 --> 1:32:06.227
This time it wasn't there.

1:32:10.931 --> 1:32:13.067
Forgive me.

1:32:15.469 --> 1:32:17.805
There's nothing
to forgive you for.

1:32:19.707 --> 1:32:23.711
I guess ever since I read your
poems since that day in Wilton,

1:32:27.248 --> 1:32:29.817
I knew that we were
destined to be together.

1:32:38.325 --> 1:32:41.929
I want you to go back
to the time before me,

1:32:44.098 --> 1:32:47.902
and I want you to forget
there ever was a Laura Riding.

1:33:09.290 --> 1:33:12.193
<i>The objects of this
story are simple enough.</i>

1:33:13.060 --> 1:33:17.798
<i>An opportunity for
a formal goodbye to you,</i>

1:33:17.831 --> 1:33:22.736
<i>and to you, and to you,
and to me, and to all that.</i>

1:33:23.504 --> 1:33:26.907
<i>Forgetfulness. Because once
all this has been settled</i>

1:33:26.941 --> 1:33:29.843
<i>in my mind and
written down and published,</i>

1:33:29.877 --> 1:33:32.146
<i>it may never be
thought about again.</i>

1:33:33.781 --> 1:33:35.449
<i>Since the end of the war,</i>

1:33:35.482 --> 1:33:38.485
<i>I have been plagued by
recurring daydreams of war.</i>

1:33:38.519 --> 1:33:41.288
<i>They persist
like an alternate life.</i>

1:33:42.990 --> 1:33:45.192
It is good to
have you back, Graves.

1:33:45.226 --> 1:33:47.127
I concur.

1:33:47.161 --> 1:33:50.030
<i>I've long regarded
poetry as a vocation,</i>

1:33:50.064 --> 1:33:52.032
<i>though I never fully understood</i>

1:33:52.066 --> 1:33:57.171
<i>why the poet
falls in love absolutely</i>

1:33:58.172 --> 1:34:01.242
<i>and is true love is for him,
the embodiment of the new</i>

1:34:02.543 --> 1:34:05.512
<i>I would seem to be
denying you in your true quality</i>

1:34:05.546 --> 1:34:09.917
<i>of one living
invisibly against kind,</i>

1:34:09.950 --> 1:34:12.987
<i>as dead beyond event.</i>

1:34:13.854 --> 1:34:15.789
<i>And yet the silence is false</i>

1:34:15.823 --> 1:34:18.025
<i>if it makes the book
seem to have written forward</i>

1:34:18.058 --> 1:34:22.429
<i>from where I was, instead
of backwards from where you are.</i>

1:34:24.265 --> 1:34:27.234
<i>How we went together to the land</i>

1:34:27.268 --> 1:34:29.970
<i>where the dead
parade the streets,</i>

1:34:30.537 --> 1:34:32.940
<i>and there met with demons,</i>

1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:36.076
<i>and returned with the
demons still treading behind.</i>

1:34:38.445 --> 1:34:40.981
<i>That was the beginning
of the end,</i>

1:34:41.849 --> 1:34:46.420
<i>and the end,
and the after is yours.</i>

1:34:48.989 --> 1:34:51.191
<i>This does all feel like destiny</i>

1:34:51.225 --> 1:34:53.394
<i>and I hope that
everyone understands</i>

1:34:53.427 --> 1:34:56.130
<i>the unbelievable story
that it was</i>

1:34:56.163 --> 1:34:58.432
<i>and that nothing's perfect.</i>

1:34:59.133 --> 1:35:02.269
<i>That she made your poetry
more precise is true.</i>

1:35:02.303 --> 1:35:06.140
<i>That her strength has helped you
control your demons, I accept.</i>

1:35:07.007 --> 1:35:08.575
<i>That she helped you
to write goodbye</i>

1:35:08.610 --> 1:35:10.477
<i>to all that is unarguable.</i>

1:35:11.578 --> 1:35:14.915
<i>You paid her bills
and you supported us,</i>

1:35:15.883 --> 1:35:18.819
<i>but Robert, at what cost?</i>

1:35:20.354 --> 1:35:23.557
<i>With love, Nancy.</i>

1:36:22.869 --> 1:36:26.442
