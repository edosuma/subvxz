money and yourself, slow.

19:40.330 --> 19:41.421
Real slow.

19:50.429 --> 19:51.417
Stop.

19:51.496 --> 19:54.860
Turn around.

19:54.930 --> 19:55.987
On your knees.

20:00.997 --> 20:04.429
My wedding day,
the birth of my twins,

20:04.496 --> 20:07.758
and now this.
Highlights, Will.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.921
<i>I'm talkin' highlights.</i>

20:09.997 --> 20:10.963

How you doin', Will?

21:27.930 --> 21:30.521

Harland wants
to give you a lift.

21:35.063 --> 21:37.324
He's not asking.

21:45.496 --> 21:47.087
Welcome home.

21:47.162 --> 21:48.788
Harland.

21:50.429 --> 21:53.259
So, where to?

21:53.329 --> 21:55.124
Coronado and Prentiss.

22:07.229 --> 22:10.059
So, how's
the federal penal system?

22:10.129 --> 22:12.561
Not as tough as they say, huh?

22:12.629 --> 22:14.720
How's the wife?

22:14.796 --> 22:19.558
She's good, I guess.
She left you?

22:19.629 --> 22:21.060
Four years ago.

22:21.129 --> 22:22.254
I'm sorry.

22:24.496 --> 22:25.462
You ought to be.

22:28.896 --> 22:31.225
Why'd you pick me up, Harland?

22:31.296 --> 22:33.888
I thought you might
pick up where you left off

22:33.963 --> 22:36.394
now that you're
as free as a bird and all.

22:36.463 --> 22:41.259
No, it's all behind me now. You
could probably afford to retire now

22:41.329 --> 22:45.193
with that sizable withdrawal
from Parish Community you made.

22:45.262 --> 22:47.524
You knew if you got caught
with money you'd be looking at

22:47.596 --> 22:50.426
an extra ten years,
so you ditched it somewhere.

22:50.496 --> 22:52.223
And now that you're out

22:52.296 --> 22:55.194
I thought you're gonna
go get that ten mil.

22:55.262 --> 22:57.751
Aren't you, Will?
Much like a squirrel

22:57.863 --> 23:01.386
returning back to its horde
after a long cold winter.

23:01.429 --> 23:04.759
I'm not the squirrel playing
with his nuts here, Harland.

23:04.830 --> 23:07.091
I don't have the money.

23:07.162 --> 23:10.424
You know that Vincent
is dead, right?

23:12.796 --> 23:16.887
I don't think he knows,
do you, Agent Fletcher?

23:16.962 --> 23:18.792
How does that make you feel?

23:21.329 --> 23:23.420
He was my friend.

23:23.496 --> 23:27.588
Yeah. He had a tough time
of it after you left.

23:27.663 --> 23:30.390
You being the brains
behind the operation.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.954
I guess he owed money
to the wrong people.

23:41.496 --> 23:45.019
Your ex-wife's place, huh?
I'm not here for her.

23:45.096 --> 23:49.858
You really think your kid wants to see you?
I'm about to find out.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.225
Grandma Harland used to say
love makes time pass,

23:53.296 --> 23:57.422
but time is certain
to make love pass.

23:57.529 --> 24:03.428

Can we talk?

I really should get going.
Just for a few minutes.

Reminded me of you.

25:40.262 --> 25:42.194
I've had so many

25:42.262 --> 25:48.422
Now that you're
sitting across from me,

is going blank.

No one sets out
to be a criminal, Alison.

But through circumstances,
bad choices, needs,

26:10.229 --> 26:14.422

unreliable friends,

26:14.495 --> 26:16.552
dishonesty, life intervenes.

26:16.628 --> 26:18.924
And I'm not trying
to justify it.

26:18.996 --> 26:23.088
I'm not making excuses for it.
I was a bad man.

26:23.162 --> 26:31.154
But I've had eight long years
to get rid of that man.

26:31.495 --> 26:38.258
To ready myself
to get to know you.

26:38.329 --> 26:39.817
I have to go.

26:52.162 --> 26:53.422
Where are you going?

26:53.495 --> 26:54.688

kind enough to give me a lift.

You don't remember me?

You were young, I guess, and I
did look a little different.

You listen to a little

No, I didn't listen to CCR. That didn't

Yeah, why?

01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:46.844
I told you Kinsey
ditched his GPS

in the back of a cab
in the French Quarter.

01:18:48.988 --> 01:18:51.510
I'm not interested in today's.
I wanna see the last few weeks.

01:18:51.587 --> 01:18:53.644
Kinsey's gonna get the
money from Montgomery,

01:18:53.754 --> 01:18:56.311
then he's gonna have to have
some kind of neutral rendezvous.

01:18:56.354 --> 01:18:58.752

he's been casing it for weeks.

Is that the fairground?
Yeah, I think so.

Twenty minutes

01:19:08.253 --> 01:19:10.685
That doesn't sound like a cab ride to me.
Nicely done, boss.

catch this prick.
