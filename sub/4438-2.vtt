WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:05.756
( Groaning )

00:05.923 --> 00:07.596
What do we do,
Chadley?

00:07.799 --> 00:08.800
I thought
they were dead.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.556
Far worse,
Trixandra.

00:10.719 --> 00:14.144
They're nearly almost
dead but not quite!

00:16.600 --> 00:18.648
<i>( Screams )</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:20.900
Man, these movies
are a lot less scary

00:21.104 --> 00:22.526
when you've actually
fought real zombies.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.607
They're slow.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.567
Just power-walk
away from them.

00:25.776 --> 00:26.993
How much you want
to bet that guy dies first?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.446
( Chomping )

00:28.654 --> 00:30.907
<i>Aah! My face
is being eaten a lot.</i>

00:32.908 --> 00:34.455
Chadley ain't
pretty no more.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.627
( Phone buzzing )

00:35.827 --> 00:37.124
One second.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.331
Ugh, another text
from Robbie.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.712
Oh, yeah, Robbie.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.715
How's, uh,
how's all that going?

00:43.919 --> 00:44.886
Ugh, I'm over him.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.589
I just wish
he was over me.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.014
Just look
at these texts.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.091
Winky frown?

00:49.299 --> 00:50.471
What does
that even mean?

00:50.676 --> 00:51.893
And you're not...

00:52.094 --> 00:54.938
not like, seeing
any other guys or...

00:55.138 --> 00:56.685
Of course I am.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.891
Meet my new
boyfriend, dude.

00:59.768 --> 01:00.690
Right, right.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.316
So...

01:02.479 --> 01:05.197
So, you know, I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to,

01:05.399 --> 01:07.618
I mean, if--if you
and me would ever,

01:07.818 --> 01:10.241
I mean,
if maybe you...

01:11.905 --> 01:14.749
Hmm, wanted to join me and Mabel
on this mystery hunt tomorrow.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.042
Conspiracy stuff
and all that.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.077
That's all.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.336
Yeah, dude.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.709
I love doing junk
with friends.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.960
Yo, Chadley,
watch out!

01:21.123 --> 01:22.124
<i>( Screams )</i>

01:22.332 --> 01:24.505
Yeah.
'Cause that's what we are.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.802
It's all we'll ever be...

01:31.300 --> 01:32.267
Friends.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.515
Dude, you're
lying on my bra.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.937
( Screaming )

02:16.011 --> 02:17.729
Hey, easy with that.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.146
It's genuine plastic.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.565
And re-pave
the cracks

02:20.724 --> 02:22.146
in the parking lot
while you're at it.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.648
I don't want my car
falling into China.

02:23.852 --> 02:27.402
Mr. Pines, what exactly
caused all this damage?

02:27.606 --> 02:28.858
I need to write
a report.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.568
Uh, a big woodpecker.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.786
Keep the change.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.700
I'm winking under
my eye patch.

02:38.909 --> 02:39.831
Works for me.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.710
Now where'd
those kids run off to?

02:47.417 --> 02:48.885
Thank you all
for coming.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.421
Hey, when there's
a mystery,

02:50.629 --> 02:53.382
<i>you can count
on your sister-ea.</i>

02:53.590 --> 02:54.682
That's an amazing rhyme.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.593
"When you want
some good--

02:56.760 --> 02:58.637
When, when
you need a Soos..."

02:58.845 --> 03:01.143
You've-- Oh, gosh.
I don't know.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.602
We're here to solve the number
one mystery in Gravity Falls.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.188
Who wrote this journal?

03:07.396 --> 03:10.320
Thirty years ago the author
vanished without a trace,

03:10.482 --> 03:12.234
but according
to this new clue,

03:12.401 --> 03:14.870
we may have found
his secret hiding place.

03:15.070 --> 03:18.370
We find that author, we learn
the answers to everything.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.122
We just need to figure out
a way to get down there...

03:21.326 --> 03:22.703
Chop it down,
dudes.

03:22.911 --> 03:23.787
Wendy.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.463
Oh, hey.
You came.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.507
Dude,
I'm so stoked about this.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.710
I've been wanting to go
adventuring with you guys.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.795
Sure beats picking up
after my dad at home.

03:31.962 --> 03:32.838
Ow!

03:33.046 --> 03:34.218
Ow!
Ow!

03:34.423 --> 03:35.219
Who put that wall there?

03:35.424 --> 03:36.300
Ow!

03:36.508 --> 03:38.602
Thanks
for the invite, man.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.852
Of course.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.808
Any time you want to--
I'm-- We're always-- Us.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.813
Uh-oh.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.564
Inviting Wendy
on our mission?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.863
Me thinks
there's romance afoot.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.406
No, look Mabel.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.608
I've thought this through,
and I'm over Wendy.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.285
I've looked at it
from every angle,

03:55.485 --> 03:56.828
and that thing
was going nowhere.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.245
I know what matters
to me now,

03:58.447 --> 04:00.324
and it's finding
the author of this journal.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.034
Ha!
You're over Wendy?

04:02.200 --> 04:05.374
Allow me to put
on my skepticles.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.375
Bwoop.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.627
I've moved on, Mabel.

04:07.831 --> 04:08.957
You should, too.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.168
Skepticles.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.753
Hey, is it just me

04:12.919 --> 04:14.671
or does that branch
kind of look like a lever?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.132
DIPPER: Huh.
Yeah.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.932
But how do we
get up there?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.135
Seems like
we'd need, like, a ladder.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.345
Or, like,
ladder shoes?

04:22.554 --> 04:24.022
Yeah, ladder shoes.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.690
I'll get Soos
to draw up a prototype.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.734
( Grunting )

04:27.934 --> 04:28.685
Boosh.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.191
Whoa!

04:30.395 --> 04:31.442
Oh, yeah.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.572
My dad used
to make me compete

04:32.773 --> 04:34.195
in these lumberjack games
when I was a kid.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.742
Guess I kind
of ruled at it.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.615
( Trembling )

04:37.819 --> 04:38.615
Whoa, whoa.
What is that?

04:38.820 --> 04:39.616
( Screaming )

04:39.821 --> 04:41.698
( grunting )

04:41.907 --> 04:42.658
Whoa.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.163
Hey, hey.
Oh, no!

04:52.209 --> 04:54.553
All right, guys.
This is it.

04:54.753 --> 04:58.348
Remember, whatever happens
down there, we tell no one.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.226
Now, who wants
to go first?

05:11.019 --> 05:12.145
ALL: Whoa.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.446
SOOS: Dude!

05:13.605 --> 05:15.983
WENDY: This is
so stupid cool.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.319
It's like a fallout
shelter or something.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.950
It must have belonged
to the author.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.781
This is going
over my bed.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.036
( Chuckling )

05:24.199 --> 05:25.701
My face feels fuzzy.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.206
This is incredible.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.629
It's like he was
preparing for a disaster.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.082
But what
kind of disaster

05:31.289 --> 05:33.758
would need supplies
for over sixty years?

05:33.959 --> 05:35.211
( Gasping )

05:35.418 --> 05:37.091
oh! my gosh.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.797
A Shmez dispenser.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.056
I remember these things.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.554
What's that?

05:41.758 --> 05:44.602
Yes, I will have some
of your old-timey face food.

05:44.761 --> 05:45.683
( Chomping )

05:45.887 --> 05:47.685
Ew. Dusty.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.937
( Chomping )

05:50.141 --> 05:51.393
Wait, GUYS-

05:51.560 --> 05:53.688
I think this can
was opened recently.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.569
The author might
still be alive, down here.

05:56.773 --> 05:57.820
Wait a minute.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.250
I think I know where
he might have gone.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.667
TOGETHER: Whoa.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.755
Whoa!

06:12.956 --> 06:14.958
Oh, man.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.260
Was this place built
in the past or the future.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.428
Yeah.
This room is way creepy.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.757
Not as creepy as Dipper's
Internet history.

06:21.923 --> 06:22.719
Hey-oh!

06:26.845 --> 06:28.768
( Groaning )

06:30.599 --> 06:32.146
What's going on, dudes?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.398
( Screaming )

06:36.146 --> 06:39.650
It's hard to be scared
with caterpillars on your face.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.574
Wall things.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.496
Crazy wall things
happening right now.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.370
Ugh.
It won't stop.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.826
( Grunting )

06:49.034 --> 06:50.627
Dipper, what do we do?

06:50.827 --> 06:51.919
Uh. Uh.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.421
Come on, come on.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.883
Find these four symbols.
Quick.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.009
Everybody step on one.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.094
One!

07:00.295 --> 07:02.639
Two !

07:02.839 --> 07:03.761
Three!

07:05.884 --> 07:06.635
( Panting )

07:06.801 --> 07:07.723
Four!

07:11.723 --> 07:13.441
Run for it!

07:16.937 --> 07:18.280
( laughing and cheering )

07:18.480 --> 07:19.902
Yes! Yes!

07:20.106 --> 07:21.779
That was...

07:21.983 --> 07:23.405
That was nuts.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.078
You ruled
back there, man.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.450
Thanks.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.828
Get a load of this
crazy surveillance room.

07:29.032 --> 07:29.828
Check it out, dudes.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.376
( Blubbering )

07:31.576 --> 07:32.998
Soos.
Soos.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.538
That is hilarious.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.589
Hey, Bro,
you forgot your vest.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.586
( Humming )

07:37.791 --> 07:38.633
( grunting )

07:38.833 --> 07:39.800
What the--

07:41.878 --> 07:43.004
"Dear Wendy.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.806
I've always had
a crush on--"

07:45.006 --> 07:46.178
( gasping )

07:46.383 --> 07:47.635
oh! my gosh.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.768
Hey, Dipper!

07:48.969 --> 07:50.892
Look what I found.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.018
( Gasping )

07:52.222 --> 07:53.223
What are you--
Give me that.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.603
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it!

07:54.808 --> 07:56.606
You're not over
Wendy at all.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.777
( Gasping )

07:57.978 --> 07:59.480
And you were going
to tell her today?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.406
No.
I changed my mind.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.700
It's a bad idea,
I'd just embarrass myself,

08:03.900 --> 08:05.573
and then I'd be another guy
she hates, like Robbie.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.745
Dipper, you should
just tell her already.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.495
One way or another,
you'll feel better afterwards.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.748
Look, Mabel, I can't tell her
no matter how much I want to.

08:13.952 --> 08:14.874
So just drop it, okay.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.455
Dude.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.665
Dipper, you got to check out
this weird metal closet.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.752
I am a robot.
I have a metal closet.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.756
Coming.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.341
This never happened.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.591
<i>He wants to tell her
but he's scared.</i>

08:27.799 --> 08:29.676
<i>Maybe he needs
a little push.</i>

08:29.843 --> 08:32.767
<i>Good idea, Mabel.
Thanks, Mabel.</i>

08:34.139 --> 08:35.390
Brother,
whatever happens,

08:35.597 --> 08:37.726
I just want you
to know something.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.277
This is
for your own good.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.693
What?
Aah.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.239
What the--

08:43.440 --> 08:44.692
Mabel!
Let us out!

08:44.899 --> 08:46.321
Oh, I'll let you out,
Dipper.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.827
As soon as
you tell Wendy

08:48.028 --> 08:50.030
that thing you've been
wanting to tell her!

08:50.238 --> 08:51.740
You'll thank me
for this later.

08:51.948 --> 08:52.699
What is she
talking about?

08:52.907 --> 08:54.159
Nothing.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.415
Mabel's just been eating
raw sugar packets again.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.996
( Chomping )

08:58.163 --> 08:59.506
That's besides the point.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.424
Let me out right now!

09:01.624 --> 09:03.843
"Sh,
where are the lights?

09:04.002 --> 09:05.379
( Screaming )

09:06.463 --> 09:08.306
( grunting )

09:08.506 --> 09:11.555
( beeping )

09:16.848 --> 09:17.940
Whoa.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.518
A hidden lab.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.070
Maybe the author did
experiments down here.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.533
Uh, what do you think
dug all these tunnels?

09:26.733 --> 09:27.609
Let's hope
we don't find out.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.613
( Gasping )

09:28.818 --> 09:31.571
( growling )

09:31.780 --> 09:33.498
( screaming )

09:33.698 --> 09:34.824
Mabel!
Open up for real!

09:35.033 --> 09:36.706
There's a monster in here!

09:36.910 --> 09:38.082
Ha. Nice try.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.630
The only monsters are
your own inner demons, Dipper.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.332
That is so wise.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.712
Dipper.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.464
Just say whatever
Mabel wants you to say

09:45.668 --> 09:46.669
so she'll let us
out of here.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.927
Come on, Dipper.
Now is the time, Bro!

09:51.508 --> 09:53.431
Wendy, I-- I...

09:55.845 --> 09:56.721
I'm gonna find
another way out.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.806
Wait, what?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.233
Dude,
where are we going?

10:03.728 --> 10:04.980
( Panting )

10:05.188 --> 10:06.110
Whoa.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.319
What do we do?
I don't know.

10:10.527 --> 10:14.122
( Roaring )

10:16.866 --> 10:17.742
Back!

10:17.951 --> 10:19.999
Back, you heinous beast!

10:26.251 --> 10:29.425
Well, I just ripped out
a monster's tongue.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.006
( Gasping )

10:31.214 --> 10:32.056
It's you.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.429
Hurry now.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.637
I scared it off,
but it will regenerate.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.601
I wasn't
expecting guests.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.141
I've been down here
for a very long time.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.226
Years.
Weeks maybe.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.731
I miss orange juice.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.108
You don't understand.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.438
You're the guy
I've been looking for!

10:47.647 --> 10:48.523
He's the gllY?

10:48.731 --> 10:49.607
Wendy,
it's the guy!

10:49.816 --> 10:50.863
The guy?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.990
I've got, like,
a jillion questions.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.537
Why did you write
the journals?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.865
Who was after you?
Why did you build this bunker?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.872
My boy, I'd love
to discuss this in time.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.703
But we have more
pressing matters.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.208
It's one
of my experiments.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.710
A shapeshifter.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.042
Able to take the form
of anyone or anything it sees.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.424
It broke free
from a cage of solid steel.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.223
I've gone half-crazy trying
to catch the creature alone.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.347
But now you're here.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.098
Will you help me catch it?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.055
( Gasping )

11:20.263 --> 11:22.891
Sure are taking
their time in there.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.818
Hey, do I look smarter
with this coat and briefcase?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.521
I feel like
I look smarter.

11:27.729 --> 11:28.525
( Gasping )

11:28.730 --> 11:29.652
Razzle dazzle!

11:29.856 --> 11:31.403
Look at this tubey thing.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.031
Frozen.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.202
Unfrozen.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.237
Frozen.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.322
Unfrozen.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.747
What's this biz?

11:38.948 --> 11:41.667
"Experiment number two-ten:
The Shapeshifter."

11:42.243 --> 11:42.914
Shapeshifter?

11:43.119 --> 11:44.746
Uh, dude,
didn't Dipper say

11:44.954 --> 11:46.831
there was a monster
in there with them?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.542
I thought
he was just joking.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.048
You know, Dipper's
jokes are terrible!

11:51.252 --> 11:52.219
Dipper!

11:54.297 --> 11:55.469
Come in.
Come in.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.050
I apologize
for the state of things.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.387
I don't get many
non-mole people visitors.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.599
Now the beast must have some
weakness that we can exploit.

12:03.765 --> 12:04.891
I used to have
my research on him,

12:05.099 --> 12:08.228
but alas, I lost my journals
so many years ago.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.528
Did you say journals?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.696
Dude, I found
one of them.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.194
It's how I tracked
you down here.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.235
What?
Could it be?

12:15.401 --> 12:18.655
My boy, I can't
express my gratitude.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.365
Oh, yes.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.917
After all these years.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.666
( Panting )

12:25.870 --> 12:26.666
Wendy!

12:26.871 --> 12:28.248
Oh, it's so dark.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.708
How will we
ever find them?

12:29.916 --> 12:31.213
Leave that to Mabel.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.720
Whoa!
Rad!

12:34.879 --> 12:36.301
Although,
isn't electric clothing

12:36.506 --> 12:37.723
kind of like
a fire hazard?

12:37.882 --> 12:38.724
No.

12:38.883 --> 12:39.805
It's a fun hazard.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.682
Now let me light the way!

12:41.886 --> 12:44.059
We're coming
for you dudes.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.150
Yes, yes.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.648
It's all here.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.195
Wendy,
isn't it amazing

12:51.396 --> 12:52.648
we're actually meeting
the real author?

12:52.855 --> 12:54.152
( Gasping )

12:54.357 --> 12:55.734
Dipper.
Look.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.615
Uh, you know what?

13:02.824 --> 13:04.701
We should probably
get going.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.627
Can I have my
journal back?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.796
You're not
going anywhere.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.593
( Roaring )

13:17.797 --> 13:20.141
( screaming )

13:24.137 --> 13:25.980
How do you like
my true form?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.603
Go on, admit it,
you like it.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.775
You!

13:29.976 --> 13:30.943
What did you do
to the real author?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.566
You'll likely
never find him.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.944
That six-fingered nerd hasn't
been himself in thirty years.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.368
But I do thank you
for bringing me his journal.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.696
He used to write while
I was in my cage.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.497
So many wonderful
forms to take.

13:43.698 --> 13:44.620
( Slurping )

13:44.824 --> 13:46.918
( chuckling )

13:48.995 --> 13:50.212
We've got to get
that journal back.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.757
Hey, body-snatcher.
Snatch this.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.672
( Growling )

13:55.877 --> 13:58.380
( grunting )

13:58.588 --> 13:59.760
( groaning )

14:01.507 --> 14:02.474
Run! Run! Run!

14:06.304 --> 14:08.272
( Screeching )

14:12.769 --> 14:14.692
( screaming )

14:14.896 --> 14:15.988
( panting )

14:17.815 --> 14:19.032
( grunting )

14:26.282 --> 14:27.158
( panting )

14:27.367 --> 14:29.836
( groaning )

14:30.036 --> 14:31.629
Oh, dudes.
Dipper! Wendy!

14:31.829 --> 14:32.796
Mabel! Soos!

14:32.997 --> 14:34.590
Wait. Careful.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.590
How do we know they're
not the shapeshifter?

14:37.794 --> 14:40.638
Maybe I am.
Mabel, inspect my shape.

14:40.838 --> 14:41.680
Poke.

14:41.839 --> 14:42.886
( Chuckling )

14:43.091 --> 14:44.343
Do that again.
Poke.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.722
( Iaughil19 )

14:45.885 --> 14:46.807
Even better
the second time.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.388
It's definitely them.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.643
( Gasping )

14:49.847 --> 14:50.939
Oh, my gosh, Wendy,
you're bleeding.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.608
It's cool.
It's cool.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.605
It's just blood, man.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.561
Don't freak out.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.941
What happened?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.442
We got attacked
by the shapeshifter.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.733
He broke out of his cage,
pretended to the author,

14:59.941 --> 15:01.193
and wants
Dipper's journal.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.157
Imagine if he escapes
into town.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.913
He could transform
into anything.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.367
We could never trust
anyone ever again.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.416
What do we do?

15:09.617 --> 15:10.618
Well.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.249
He took us into his home,
tricked us,

15:12.453 --> 15:14.797
and tried
to destroy us.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.795
I say we return
the favor.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.429
Dipper, my b0Y-

15:22.839 --> 15:24.933
Come out.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.931
I must speak with you!

15:27.135 --> 15:28.603
( Growling )

15:28.761 --> 15:32.607
Reveal yourself, you
single-formed human weakling.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.229
<i>Oh, boy, Dipper-.</i>

15:34.434 --> 15:37.688
That book sure is full
of some great monsters.

15:37.895 --> 15:38.817
There you are.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.194
Ooh!
And a new one.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.078
Should I be one?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.576
Or the other.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.781
How about both?

15:48.990 --> 15:50.958
( Roaring )

15:51.159 --> 15:52.877
( screaming )

15:57.498 --> 15:58.920
Guys, he's coming!
He's coming!

15:59.083 --> 16:00.926
Now! Now!
Now! Now! Now!

16:01.085 --> 16:02.302
It's not working,
dude.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.636
Hey.
Let go.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.766
You leave him alone.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.809
( Screaming )

16:09.010 --> 16:10.057
Wendy!

16:11.596 --> 16:13.189
( Grunting )

16:14.223 --> 16:17.318
( screaming )

16:18.644 --> 16:21.022
( screaming )

16:21.230 --> 16:22.277
(yelling )

16:23.399 --> 16:25.072
Aah.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.709
( Groaning )

16:37.038 --> 16:38.506
Wendy!

16:44.962 --> 16:46.054
Wendy?

16:46.255 --> 16:48.053
No, no, no, no, no!

16:48.257 --> 16:49.349
Can you hear me?
Oh.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.597
Please be okay.
Please be okay!

16:53.721 --> 16:54.973
( Gasping )

16:55.181 --> 16:56.558
Oh, no, oh, no!
This is all my fault!

16:56.766 --> 16:58.359
If I had told you when
we were in the closet

16:58.559 --> 16:59.856
we wouldn't be
in this mess.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.735
But I was too scared and now
you could be hurt or worse

17:02.939 --> 17:04.486
and I never even got
a chance to tell you

17:04.690 --> 17:07.660
I'm, like, in love
with you Wendy.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.077
( Sighing )

17:13.074 --> 17:13.915
Uh...

17:14.116 --> 17:15.663
Dipper?

17:15.867 --> 17:17.586
Wendy?

17:17.787 --> 17:18.709
Wait.

17:18.913 --> 17:21.086
Then who is--
Look out!

17:21.290 --> 17:22.666
Give me back
that journal!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.047
Never!

17:25.920 --> 17:27.718
Get off me.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.723
( Grunting )

17:33.803 --> 17:34.725
Give it back.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.226
It belongs to Dipper.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.397
Hit her with the axe!

17:37.598 --> 17:38.645
Don't listen
to her, Dipper!

17:38.849 --> 17:39.645
She's the shapeshifter!

17:39.850 --> 17:40.726
Ugh!

17:40.935 --> 17:42.482
I don't know who's who!

17:42.687 --> 17:43.654
Give me a sign!

17:48.025 --> 17:48.947
( Gasping )

17:49.151 --> 17:50.744
( grunting )

17:50.945 --> 17:53.414
( screaming )

17:53.614 --> 17:56.413
( snarling )

17:59.120 --> 18:00.747
Push him in!

18:00.955 --> 18:02.753
( Grunting )

18:05.751 --> 18:06.673
Huh?

18:06.877 --> 18:08.675
Frozen!

18:08.879 --> 18:09.755
Boosh!
Boom!

18:09.922 --> 18:15.429
No. No!
Let me out!

18:15.636 --> 18:17.559
( Screeching )

18:19.807 --> 18:21.730
Let's get out
of here, dudes.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.687
( Iaughil19 )

18:24.895 --> 18:26.067
( gasping )

18:26.272 --> 18:28.866
You think you're so clever,
don't you, Dipper?

18:29.066 --> 18:31.364
But you have no idea
what you're up against.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.663
You'll never
find the author.

18:33.863 --> 18:34.955
If you keep digging,

18:35.156 --> 18:37.329
you'll meet a fate worse
than you can imagine.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.878
And this will be
the last form you ever take!

18:41.078 --> 18:43.706
( Screaming )

18:47.877 --> 18:50.300
Good luck
sleeping tonight.

18:54.759 --> 18:55.885
Dude, I think
I'm kind of

18:56.093 --> 18:57.470
adventured out
for a little while.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.431
My face hurts
from doing this all day.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.019
Yeah, but you got to admit
we're all total heroes.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.775
Hey, who wants to go get
some heroes breakfast, huh?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.606
Syrup on cereal!

19:08.814 --> 19:10.691
Mabel,
you're a visionary.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.663
Look, Wendy,
about earlier,

19:15.863 --> 19:16.910
In the heat
of the moment

19:17.114 --> 19:19.458
I might have said
some dumb things and--

19:19.659 --> 19:22.208
Can't we just pretend
none of that ever happened?

19:22.411 --> 19:24.379
Please.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.753
Dude. Dude.
It's okay.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.506
I always kind of knew.

19:29.710 --> 19:30.962
Wait.
You did?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.467
Yeah, man.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.969
I mean, you think
I can't hear that stuff

19:34.173 --> 19:36.175
you're constantly
whispering under your breath?

19:36.384 --> 19:37.681
( Groaning )

19:37.843 --> 19:39.345
Oh, man.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.600
Listen, Dipper.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.312
I'm, like,
super flattered.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.939
But, I'm too old for you.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.861
I mean, you know
that, right?

19:48.062 --> 19:49.405
Ugh.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.941
Mabel said confessing
would make me feel better.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.617
Well, how do you feel?

19:53.818 --> 19:57.789
Anxious. Scared.
Kind of itchy.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.114
Dude.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.498
Don't be itchy, man.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.872
Let me tell you
something,

20:02.076 --> 20:04.670
this summer was super
boring until you showed up.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.919
I have more fun with you than,
like, practically anybody else.

20:08.082 --> 20:11.586
And if you ever stop being
my friend, I would, like,

20:11.794 --> 20:14.172
throw myself
into the bottomless pit.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.633
So, things won't
be too awkward now?

20:16.799 --> 20:18.676
I just wrestled
myself, dude.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.345
That was awkward.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.725
If you can handle
that monster,

20:21.929 --> 20:23.772
you can handle
a little awkwardness.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.725
( Chuckling )

20:25.933 --> 20:26.809
Friends?

20:27.017 --> 20:27.939
Yeah, dude.
Friends.

20:28.144 --> 20:28.940
( Grunting )

20:29.145 --> 20:30.692
( chuckling )

20:34.150 --> 20:35.572
Oh, and hey, Dipper.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.369
See you for movie
night tomorrow.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.947
Your place
this time, okay?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.873
So, how did it go?

20:49.039 --> 20:49.961
( Gasping )

20:50.166 --> 20:51.133
What did you hear?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.926
Everything.
All the time.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.300
I'm not here.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.848
Mabel, how can everything
be so amazing

20:58.048 --> 21:00.676
and so terrible
all at the same time?

21:00.843 --> 21:03.266
I'm sorry for being
so pushy, Dipper.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.563
If it's any consolation,

21:04.722 --> 21:05.689
I'm already
working on a list

21:05.890 --> 21:07.813
of your potential
rebound crushes.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.234
Thanks, Mabel.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.733
( Grunting )

21:11.937 --> 21:13.154
I'm still bummed

21:13.355 --> 21:14.857
we're no closer
to finding the author guy.

21:15.065 --> 21:18.114
At least I got his sciency coat
and briefcase.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.741
Whoa.
What the--

21:19.945 --> 21:22.414
Soos, that's not a briefcase.
That's a laptop.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.583
And a really
busted up one, too.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.582
I bet I could get this thing
fixed up in a few days.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.333
It's gonna take
a lot of duct tape.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.880
This could be
our next clue.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.173
Is it just me,

21:35.377 --> 21:36.924
or does Gravity Falls TV
only have the worst movies?

21:37.129 --> 21:40.178
<i>You're watching the Gravity
Falls Bargain Movie Showcase.</i>

21:40.382 --> 21:41.634
<i>Coming up next,</i>

21:41.801 --> 21:44.099
The Widdlest Wampire.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.931
The Planet People
Of Planet Planet!

21:47.139 --> 21:49.437
Help!
My Mummy's A Werewolf!

21:49.600 --> 21:51.728
Attack
Of The Exclamation Points!!!

21:51.936 --> 21:53.938
The Man With No Taste.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.693
Ghost Turtle.

21:55.898 --> 21:59.448
Help! My Mummy's
A Werewolf Two: This Again.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.199
You want to never watch
this channel again?
