Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:05.219 --> 02:06.645
Why're we stopping?

02:06.647 --> 02:08.770
It's the car.

02:08.771 --> 02:11.863
You know, these old cars,
they're always overheating, so.

02:13.869 --> 02:16.048
Okay, so now what?

02:16.050 --> 02:18.848
We just gotta wait a couple minutes.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.058
I don't wanna be late for the party.

02:26.060 --> 02:27.433
Just a couple minutes.

02:29.000 --> 02:29.988
I got an idea of what we could do

02:29.990 --> 02:32.418
while we're waiting.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.644
Oh yeah, what's that?

02:33.646 --> 02:35.478
Butt stuff.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.498
What?

02:36.500 --> 02:38.518
Kissing, I thought we could just kiss.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.458
Classic

02:39.460 --> 02:40.703
American

02:40.705 --> 02:41.536
kissing.

02:47.530 --> 02:50.628
I should call my sister and
tell her I'm gonna be late.

02:50.630 --> 02:51.668
Sure.

02:51.670 --> 02:52.503
Yeah, do that.

02:53.710 --> 02:54.543
Family first.

02:56.790 --> 02:57.983
Then teamwork.

03:04.840 --> 03:05.673
Hey.

03:07.170 --> 03:08.333
No, we're on our way.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.393
No.

03:13.590 --> 03:14.896
Jay's car overheated,

03:14.898 --> 03:18.398
so we're just waiting for it to cool down.

03:22.456 --> 03:26.169
No, I'm fine.

03:26.171 --> 03:27.838
I am fine, trust me.

03:30.049 --> 03:31.132
No, he's not.

03:35.715 --> 03:36.554
Mandy.

03:39.818 --> 03:41.738
Trust me.

03:41.740 --> 03:42.608
Okay, I'll see.

03:42.610 --> 03:44.768
Mandy, please don't tell Mom

03:44.770 --> 03:46.637
because, you know,

03:46.639 --> 03:47.753
the way she gets.

03:49.510 --> 03:50.410
Everything okay?

03:51.701 --> 03:52.534
Yeah.

03:54.928 --> 03:56.714
How's the car?

03:56.716 --> 03:59.016
Probably just got
another couple of minutes.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.858
Hey,

04:01.860 --> 04:03.218
I stole some Halloween candy

04:03.220 --> 04:05.248
from some kids in my neighborhood.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.100
You want a piece?

04:07.830 --> 04:09.079
Yeah, actually, I do.

04:09.081 --> 04:10.553
Ah.

04:10.555 --> 04:11.386
What?

04:11.388 --> 04:12.221
What do you say?

04:14.189 --> 04:15.987
Trick-or-treat?

04:15.989 --> 04:20.988
There you go, go for it.

04:21.630 --> 04:23.631
I can't feel anything.

04:24.710 --> 04:26.564
You got it, just pull on it!

04:26.566 --> 04:27.701
Pull on it!

04:27.703 --> 04:28.838
- Please.
- I'm trying, it's stuck.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.838
Just keep pulling on it.

04:30.840 --> 04:31.788
Keep grabbing.

04:31.790 --> 04:33.669
It's like a Toostie Roll.

04:33.671 --> 04:35.393
It's a full-size candy bar.

04:38.489 --> 04:39.962
What?

04:39.964 --> 04:41.131
What happened?

04:42.402 --> 04:44.398
What?

04:44.400 --> 04:47.055
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

04:48.910 --> 04:49.810
Where you going?

04:51.841 --> 04:53.368
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:53.370 --> 04:55.420
You don't have to go, it was just a joke.

04:56.290 --> 04:58.078
You're fucking disgusting.

04:58.080 --> 04:58.983
It was a joke!

05:06.367 --> 05:07.948
What're you doing?

05:07.950 --> 05:09.333
Jay, just fuck off.

05:12.787 --> 05:14.718
You're just gonna walk home?

05:14.720 --> 05:16.183
I'll find a ride, just go.

05:17.060 --> 05:19.472
Sara, it was just a joke.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.583
I'll find a ride, just go, just go.

05:24.438 --> 05:28.083
You know, it's going to be
hard for you to find a ride

05:28.085 --> 05:29.668
when you don't have this.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.218
Give me that.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.646
Give me that.

05:32.648 --> 05:33.548
You want this?

05:33.550 --> 05:34.548
Give me the phone.

05:34.550 --> 05:35.698
- Give me the phone.
- Ooooooh.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.511
Have fun walking, bitch.

05:38.346 --> 05:39.177
Jay!

05:39.179 --> 05:40.642
Jay!

05:46.066 --> 05:46.899
Asshole.

05:53.018 --> 05:56.928
Fuck!

06:12.685 --> 06:13.516
Oh, shit!

06:23.700 --> 06:24.543
Hello?

06:29.820 --> 06:31.523
I just need to use your phone.

06:43.090 --> 06:44.790
Can somebody help me, I just need,

06:45.865 --> 06:47.605
I just need to use the phone.

07:15.262 --> 07:16.095
Hello?

07:19.175 --> 07:20.008
Hello?

07:21.576 --> 07:23.311
Is anyone in here?

07:30.911 --> 07:31.744
Hello?

07:33.606 --> 07:34.439
Hello?

07:45.586 --> 07:46.419
Hello?

09:28.637 --> 09:29.470
Sara.

09:31.661 --> 09:32.494
Jay?

09:34.062 --> 09:35.682
Jay!

09:35.684 --> 09:37.955
Trick 'r treat.

09:46.263 --> 09:47.738
It's another
beautiful October day

09:47.740 --> 09:48.571
here in Yost Town.

09:48.573 --> 09:49.998
Halloween's right around
the corner, folks.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.718
I'll be in Inebriate
City for the two for ones

09:51.720 --> 09:53.358
and don't forget, the girls
with the sluttiest costumes

09:53.360 --> 09:54.948
get in free and drink till they pass out.

09:54.950 --> 09:57.138
I'm your man, DJ Dick,
"from 105.6 The Mix,"

09:57.140 --> 09:58.840
putting hits all up in your mouth.

10:37.674 --> 10:39.255
Have you ever killed anything?

10:39.257 --> 10:40.258
What?

10:40.260 --> 10:42.068
Like, when you were younger.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.988
Every kill a bird, cat or anything?

10:44.990 --> 10:48.048
I killed a pet fish
by overfeeding it once.

10:48.050 --> 10:49.289
Have you ever just wanted
to just kill someone?

10:50.180 --> 10:51.638
I don't know, maybe.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.588
Hey, what's up with
you and Ricky anyway?

10:53.590 --> 10:54.618
Did you fuck him yet?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.288
Jesus, Mandy.

10:56.290 --> 10:57.121
What?

10:57.123 --> 10:59.268
Don't tell me you haven't fucked him yet.

10:59.270 --> 11:00.668
Maybe.

11:00.670 --> 11:01.528
Whatever, Melissa.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.148
At least given a handy?

11:03.150 --> 11:04.200
You're such a slut.

11:05.655 --> 11:07.188
Oh wait, look.

11:07.190 --> 11:08.378
There she is.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.418
Who?

11:09.420 --> 11:10.670
Old Aunt Ethel.

11:11.830 --> 11:14.388
Why do they call her "Old Aunt Ethel?"

11:14.390 --> 11:16.728
Because, like 20 years ago,

11:16.730 --> 11:19.178
she killed her entire family in that house

11:19.180 --> 11:22.395
and all the neighbors could
hear someone inside yelling,

11:22.397 --> 11:23.745
"Stop, Aunt Ethel!

11:23.747 --> 11:25.433
"Please, God, stop, Aunt Ethel!"

11:28.705 --> 11:30.123
Hey!

11:30.125 --> 11:31.336
Jesus, Mark.

11:31.338 --> 11:32.181
You scared the shit out of me.

11:32.183 --> 11:33.488
What're you scared of?

11:33.490 --> 11:35.091
I haven't even pulled it out yet.

11:35.093 --> 11:35.926
Ew.

11:37.010 --> 11:38.207
Gross.

11:40.023 --> 11:40.856
Guys!

11:42.385 --> 11:43.968
I love this girl.

11:45.992 --> 11:46.825
Oh.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.018
Just telling Melissa, here,
the story of Old Aunt Ethel.

11:50.020 --> 11:52.228
Oh yeah, it's almost Halloween, huh?

11:52.230 --> 11:53.637
What does that mean?

11:54.680 --> 11:55.893
So Old Aint Ethel,

11:56.750 --> 12:00.208
every year on Halloween,
she lures the kids inside.

12:00.210 --> 12:02.868
Says she has very special candy,

12:02.870 --> 12:06.278
candy that's gonna make
all their wishes come true.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.528
And when she gets them inside,

12:08.530 --> 12:10.168
she slaughters them,

12:10.170 --> 12:12.695
sawing off their limbs, one by one.

12:12.697 --> 12:13.528
Yeah right.

12:13.530 --> 12:14.361
No, it's true.

12:14.363 --> 12:15.913
Then why isn't she in jail yet?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.468
Because if you don't have a body,

12:19.470 --> 12:20.578
you don't have a crime.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.648
What does that mean?

12:22.650 --> 12:24.848
They say that Old Aunt Ethel,

12:24.850 --> 12:28.418
she turns all the kids' body
parts in Halloween treats,

12:28.420 --> 12:31.800
leaving behind no remains at all.

12:41.368 --> 12:42.398
That's one psychotic bitch.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.798
You definitely don't wanna

12:43.800 --> 12:45.500
go trick-or-treating at her place.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.051
She'll turn you into pumpkin pie.

14:32.992 --> 14:33.823
11, 12

14:33.825 --> 14:35.720
13, 14,

14:35.722 --> 14:36.921
15, 16, 17,

14:36.923 --> 14:38.285
18, 19,

14:38.287 --> 14:39.120
20.

14:42.833 --> 14:44.000
11 more to go.

14:53.497 --> 14:54.328
Hello.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.370
Hey, girl, what you doin'?

14:56.950 --> 14:59.323
You know, just "twerking
the fleek," right?

15:01.880 --> 15:02.713
What?

15:04.634 --> 15:05.467
I don't know.

15:07.820 --> 15:09.693
You going to Mandy's party tonight?

15:10.530 --> 15:11.361
I don't know yet.

15:11.363 --> 15:13.540
I still have a lot of
studying and stuff to do.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.238
Bitch, you better.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.952
You on the rag or something?

15:17.954 --> 15:19.025
What? No!

15:19.027 --> 15:19.878
Mmmmm.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.078
You got that heavy flow.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.263
Girl, just double up.

15:24.370 --> 15:25.589
Double up?

15:25.591 --> 15:28.618
Yeah, girl, just stick
two super heavy flows

15:28.620 --> 15:30.608
right up in that bitch

15:30.610 --> 15:32.738
and you could party for
four hours straight.

15:32.740 --> 15:33.891
No leakage.

15:33.893 --> 15:34.726
Ha.

15:35.630 --> 15:36.828
What, no, I'm not on my period.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.258
I just don't know if I'm gonna go yet.

15:39.260 --> 15:41.518
Girl, you gotta live a little.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.508
This is not Ohio or
wherever the fuck you from.

15:45.510 --> 15:48.629
We party hard out here, okay, hoe?

15:48.631 --> 15:50.161
Okay.

15:50.163 --> 15:53.087
Hey, do you know about all
that "Old Aunt Ethel" stuff?

15:54.460 --> 15:57.978
Yeah, girl, everybody has
heard about Old Aunt Ethel.

15:57.980 --> 15:59.488
I mean, is it true that
she takes all the kids

15:59.490 --> 16:01.628
on Halloween night and stuff?

16:01.630 --> 16:06.208
Bitch, you worry about
the wrong things, okay?

16:06.210 --> 16:08.808
Get your shit together,
we partying hard tonight.

16:08.810 --> 16:09.850
Okay, hoe.

16:22.261 --> 16:23.094
Ah.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.318
Let's see.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.837
What do I need?

16:29.739 --> 16:31.397
Bop!

16:31.399 --> 16:32.232
Ah!

16:33.519 --> 16:35.098
Ah, yes,

16:35.100 --> 16:36.017
I need you.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.513
Yeah!

16:39.583 --> 16:40.916
Ah, I love that.

16:42.009 --> 16:42.842
Woo.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.108
Yee-haw!

17:10.111 --> 17:10.944
Yee-haw!

17:13.878 --> 17:15.154
Look at that.

17:17.761 --> 17:19.458
Oh, I'm getting excited!

17:19.460 --> 17:20.824
I'm getting excited!

18:25.570 --> 18:26.401
Ricky!

18:26.403 --> 18:27.756
Get the fuck out of here!

18:27.758 --> 18:28.591
Oh!

18:30.608 --> 18:31.439
Sorry.

18:31.441 --> 18:32.274
And now!

18:37.710 --> 18:42.029
Time for my famous pickled chocolates.

18:59.004 --> 19:01.786
Mmmm, it already smells good.

19:11.860 --> 19:12.803
Oh, the heel.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.608
The heel and the balls.

19:15.610 --> 19:17.852
The balls of the feet are the best.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.238
Mmmm-mmmm, I can almost taste 'em.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.783
I can almost taste 'em.

19:27.944 --> 19:28.863
I love it.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.143
Everybody loves them.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.247
I'll eat 'em, that's for damn sure.

19:41.673 --> 19:43.995
Yes, sir.

19:57.749 --> 19:58.580
Perfect.

19:58.582 --> 19:59.415
Perfect.

20:01.861 --> 20:05.869
All right, now, let's
get these in the oven.

20:11.784 --> 20:12.617
Ah, yes.

20:14.198 --> 20:15.031
Of course.

20:16.350 --> 20:20.573
With this soul, another day will come.

20:27.429 --> 20:28.429
100!

20:30.047 --> 20:31.335
Yeah, bitches!

22:30.291 --> 22:31.285
Aren't you with Melissa?

22:31.287 --> 22:32.118
What?

22:32.120 --> 22:33.573
No, I ditched that bitch.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.024
No fucking way.

22:39.989 --> 22:41.015
Hey, what's up, bitch?

22:41.017 --> 22:42.403
Are you seeing this?

22:46.467 --> 22:47.918
Ew, what a dick.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.070
Just come on, fuck him.

22:51.933 --> 22:53.033
Melissa, wait!

22:54.337 --> 22:56.721
I just can't believe
he would do this to me.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.470
Fuck him, Melissa.

22:58.472 --> 23:00.088
Who cares?

23:00.090 --> 23:01.738
I care!

23:01.740 --> 23:03.458
Well, what did you expect?

23:03.460 --> 23:04.418
What does that mean?

23:04.420 --> 23:06.198
You haven't even given him a handy.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.388
Great, thanks.

23:07.390 --> 23:08.802
Nice pep talk.

23:09.810 --> 23:11.308
Melissa, can we please talk?

23:11.310 --> 23:13.238
She doesn't want to talk to you, Ricky.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.998
Melissa, please, just
give me a chance to explain.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.838
Come on.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.298
There's nothing to explain.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.638
I can handle this.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.508
Fine, go ahead, I was
just trying to help.

23:20.510 --> 23:22.628
I really don't care about
what you have to say, Ricky.

23:22.630 --> 23:23.818
It's all bullshit anyways.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.228
Just leave me alone.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.613
Yeah, fuck off, Ricky.

23:31.190 --> 23:32.768
Leave me alone, Ricky.

23:32.770 --> 23:33.920
It's me, Mark.

23:35.010 --> 23:36.298
Well, is Ricky there with you?

23:36.300 --> 23:39.560
No, he left, like, a long time ago.

23:39.562 --> 23:41.148
Are you kidding me?

23:41.150 --> 23:42.038
Whatever, fuck him.

23:42.040 --> 23:42.998
Let's party.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.068
Dr. Dick in the house.

23:45.070 --> 23:46.608
I think I wanna go home.

23:46.610 --> 23:48.218
Come on, Mel.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.588
I'm really not in the mood to party.

23:49.590 --> 23:50.958
Come on, don't let him get in the way

23:50.960 --> 23:52.338
of you living your life, Melissa.

23:52.340 --> 23:53.248
It's not just him.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.500
I was up late last night
studying, I'm tired.

23:56.410 --> 23:57.748
I'm just gonna go.

23:57.750 --> 23:59.148
I'll walk with you.

23:59.150 --> 24:00.548
Fuck, seriously?

24:00.550 --> 24:02.898
You don't have to do
that, Mandy, I'm fine.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.731
She's fine, babe.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.564
Mark, shut up.

24:04.566 --> 24:05.397
This is girl code.

24:05.399 --> 24:06.579
You don't fucking get it.

24:06.581 --> 24:08.443
You're right, I don't fucking get it.

24:08.445 --> 24:10.838
And don't make me pull
a "Ricky" on you too.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.147
Really, Mark?

24:12.149 --> 24:13.488
Too soon?

24:13.490 --> 24:14.359
Fuck you.

24:14.361 --> 24:15.528
Eh.

24:15.530 --> 24:16.378
I'll tell you what, Mark.

24:16.380 --> 24:17.798
You go ahead and pull a "Ricky" on me

24:17.800 --> 24:19.068
but you better make it worth your while

24:19.070 --> 24:21.308
because it'll be the last time
you stick that little pee-pee

24:21.310 --> 24:23.488
in a vagina ever again, got it?

24:23.490 --> 24:24.676
Got it.

24:24.678 --> 24:26.188
Now you're gonna get it.

24:27.472 --> 24:28.338
Seriously?

24:28.340 --> 24:29.173
Jesus.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.678
You need to get over
him, ASAP, seriously.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.078
I wasn't gonna say anything
but I fucked him last year

24:36.080 --> 24:38.178
and he was, like, the
quickest cummer ever.

24:38.180 --> 24:39.011
It was pitiful.

24:39.013 --> 24:40.658
Mandy, are you serious?

24:40.660 --> 24:42.678
What? It was last year
before you guys even met.

24:42.680 --> 24:43.818
And you weren't gonna tell me?

24:43.820 --> 24:45.348
I did just tell you.

24:45.350 --> 24:46.846
Jesus, Mandy.

24:46.848 --> 24:47.679
Whatevs.

24:47.681 --> 24:48.878
My point is you need to get over him.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.268
He's a waste of time.

24:50.270 --> 24:52.558
Seems like everything's
a waste of time nowadays.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.548
Oh, look.

24:53.550 --> 24:54.868
There's Aunt Ethel.

24:54.870 --> 24:56.088
Come on, let's go look.

24:56.090 --> 24:57.388
No.

24:57.390 --> 24:58.221
Come on.

24:58.223 --> 24:59.056
Seriously?

25:00.690 --> 25:01.973
Well, wait up.

25:08.080 --> 25:11.388
She looks like a regular old
lady baking a cake to me.

25:11.390 --> 25:13.348
It may seem that way
but I assure you it's not.

25:13.350 --> 25:15.488
She's probably boiling
someone's skull right now.

25:15.490 --> 25:17.198
Oh, come on.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.150
Yes, sir.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.468
This is ridiculous.

25:20.470 --> 25:22.808
Why are we creeping
around some poor old lady?

25:22.810 --> 25:23.855
Poor old lady?

25:23.857 --> 25:24.774
Yeah right.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.376
I'm going home.

25:28.378 --> 25:29.628
This is stupid.

25:34.048 --> 25:35.209
Mmmm-mmmm.

25:39.744 --> 25:40.577
Yes, sir.

25:52.975 --> 25:54.174
Mmmmmm.

25:54.176 --> 25:55.285
Oh,

25:55.287 --> 25:56.537
it's delicious.

25:57.484 --> 25:59.052
Mmmmm.

25:59.054 --> 26:01.453
Put that back in there.

26:01.455 --> 26:02.288
Yes, sir.

26:56.742 --> 26:57.575
Shit.

27:05.557 --> 27:06.423
Hey!

27:06.425 --> 27:09.098
What're you doing there?

27:09.100 --> 27:10.200
You trick-or-treating?

27:12.500 --> 27:13.988
Trick-or-treat.

27:13.990 --> 27:16.758
Well, Halloween ain't for a couple days.

27:16.760 --> 27:17.893
You're early.

27:19.190 --> 27:20.998
I'm really bad about time, I'm so sorry.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.528
- No.
- I'll just be going now.

27:22.530 --> 27:26.598
You're in luck because
I never turn away company.

27:26.600 --> 27:31.600
And I make the best pickled
Halloween treats in town.

27:32.190 --> 27:35.058
They're chocolate and they're delicious.

27:35.060 --> 27:35.891
Come on in.

27:35.893 --> 27:37.398
I really should be going.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.088
Oh, no, no, no, not yet.

27:40.090 --> 27:41.988
Not yet, dear.

27:41.990 --> 27:44.818
I've got some delicious treats inside.

27:44.820 --> 27:45.918
Come on in.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.213
- Come on, come on in.
- I should be going.

27:48.215 --> 27:49.046
Come on.

27:49.048 --> 27:51.518
I really don't wanna ruin
my appetite, like you said.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.228
Halloween's a couple days away, right?

27:54.230 --> 27:56.880
You gonna come
back to see me on Halloween?

27:57.950 --> 27:58.781
Yeah.

27:58.783 --> 28:01.028
You better, young lady.

28:01.030 --> 28:03.748
Cause everyone loves

28:03.750 --> 28:05.678
Aunt Ethel's

28:05.680 --> 28:06.843
pickled chocolates.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.005
They're homemade.

28:37.377 --> 28:42.377
Mom, is that you?

29:43.977 --> 29:46.278
Jesus, Ricky, what're you doing here?!

29:46.280 --> 29:47.258
What?!

29:47.260 --> 29:48.918
The front door was open.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.558
I called for you but you didn't answer.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.278
How long have you been here?

29:52.280 --> 29:54.418
I just walked in.

29:54.420 --> 29:55.548
Don't worry, I didn't see anything.

29:55.550 --> 29:56.808
Get out!

29:56.810 --> 29:57.718
I just wanna talk.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.551
Leave!

29:58.553 --> 30:00.838
Before I call the cops!

30:00.840 --> 30:02.208
Are you serious?

30:02.210 --> 30:03.343
Get out!

30:04.380 --> 30:05.213
Okay.

30:06.090 --> 30:06.923
Okay.

30:07.820 --> 30:09.926
You know, you're making
a big fucking mistake.

30:17.473 --> 30:18.306
Jeez.

31:03.807 --> 31:06.002
Okay, just wait here.

31:06.004 --> 31:06.921
Don't move.

31:07.817 --> 31:08.734
Don't move.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.845
Shit!

31:41.130 --> 31:43.188
I'll be right back.

31:43.190 --> 31:44.903
No cheating.

31:49.350 --> 31:52.883
Just wait right there.

31:53.820 --> 31:54.651
Hello.

31:54.653 --> 31:56.093
Hi, this is Mortimer J. Jackson.

31:56.095 --> 31:56.926
Who?

31:56.928 --> 31:58.417
Mortimer J. Jackson.

31:58.419 --> 31:59.250
I'm with...

31:59.252 --> 32:00.243
Who now?

32:00.245 --> 32:01.980
Mortimer J. Jackson.

32:01.982 --> 32:02.849
What?

32:02.851 --> 32:04.268
- I'm with...
- What? What?

32:04.270 --> 32:05.965
I'm with
Vacation Surplus, ma'am.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.114
What do you want?

32:07.116 --> 32:08.570
Ma'am, I
was just calling today

32:08.572 --> 32:10.388
to ask you if you were curious about

32:10.390 --> 32:12.516
ever wanting to take a vacation.

32:12.518 --> 32:13.589
Ma'am, have you thought about...

32:13.591 --> 32:14.422
No!

32:14.424 --> 32:15.255
Ma'am, have you thought...

32:15.257 --> 32:16.088
No!

32:16.090 --> 32:17.868
I don't have any, I don't want any either.

32:17.870 --> 32:19.750
Hello, ma'am?

32:23.231 --> 32:24.800
Hey, what's up, bitch?

32:24.802 --> 32:26.998
Hey, what're you up to?

32:27.000 --> 32:28.258
Nothing.

32:28.260 --> 32:30.538
You'll never guess what Ricky just did.

32:30.540 --> 32:33.828
Did you catch him jacking
off outside your window?

32:33.830 --> 32:35.878
What? No.

32:35.880 --> 32:36.818
Why?

32:36.820 --> 32:38.698
I never told you that?

32:38.700 --> 32:39.938
Told me what?

32:39.940 --> 32:42.018
He jacks off outside
my window sometimes.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.598
But he does it to like everybody.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.098
Jesus, Mandy, why did you
set me up with this creep?

32:46.100 --> 32:48.598
I didn't want to be
the only one with crabs.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.457
What?!

32:50.924 --> 32:52.108
What?

32:52.110 --> 32:54.110
Nothing, you're fine, just keep going.

32:59.940 --> 33:01.508
What are you doing?

33:01.510 --> 33:03.238
Nothing, wanna come over?

33:03.240 --> 33:04.128
Yeah.

33:04.130 --> 33:04.961
Oh, remind me,

33:04.963 --> 33:06.516
I have something to tell
you when I get there.

33:16.510 --> 33:17.693
You cheated.

33:20.030 --> 33:21.793
You cheated!

33:23.540 --> 33:25.133
I had six!

33:26.270 --> 33:30.043
I know damn well I had six!

33:37.391 --> 33:38.391
You cheater!

33:49.570 --> 33:50.570
Well I'll be damned.

33:51.567 --> 33:52.753
I do have six.

34:06.507 --> 34:09.458
Hey, Mrs.
Cooper, is Mandy home?

34:09.460 --> 34:10.293
Hey.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.447
Sara, right?

34:13.449 --> 34:15.208
Melissa, actually.

34:15.210 --> 34:17.418
Oh, right, Melissa.

34:17.420 --> 34:20.483
I guess you just have one
of those forgettable faces.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.263
Oh, okay.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.672
Is Mandy home?

34:28.510 --> 34:29.341
Yeah.

34:29.342 --> 34:30.623
The bitch is in her room.

34:32.190 --> 34:33.987
So, where you guys going tonight?

34:33.989 --> 34:35.648
Oh, I'm not sure.

34:35.650 --> 34:37.967
Well, I can hang out
with you guys tonight

34:37.969 --> 34:39.768
if you wanted me to.

34:39.770 --> 34:43.668
You know what the new in thing
is these days, don't you?

34:43.670 --> 34:45.063
What's that?

34:45.065 --> 34:46.418
MILFs.

34:46.420 --> 34:49.608
These young guys, they love us MILFs.

34:49.610 --> 34:50.568
Mom's I'd Like to...

34:50.570 --> 34:51.478
No, I got it, I got it.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.625
I know what a MILF is.

34:52.627 --> 34:54.668
And I could even hook you guys up.

34:54.670 --> 34:58.528
Like when a guy hits on
me and I don't like him,

34:58.530 --> 35:00.043
then I could let you have him.

35:02.070 --> 35:04.388
Gee, thanks.

35:04.390 --> 35:07.063
Okay, well just let me know.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.113
Right.

35:13.140 --> 35:14.040
Come in.

35:16.570 --> 35:18.418
Jesus, you guys.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.138
It's all good, just come in.

35:20.140 --> 35:20.983
No, I'll wait.

35:26.630 --> 35:27.932
Babe.

35:27.934 --> 35:29.658
I was just about to cum.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.560
Well now you're just about to leave.

35:32.580 --> 35:33.722
So it's like that?

35:33.724 --> 35:34.555
It's like that.

35:34.557 --> 35:36.148
Look, guys, I can go.

35:36.150 --> 35:36.981
No.

35:36.983 --> 35:37.888
He's leaving.

35:37.890 --> 35:39.708
This is bullshit, Mandy.

35:39.710 --> 35:42.208
No, this is girl code, bitch.

35:42.210 --> 35:43.758
Raised on the streets, son.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.268
Don't get clapped up.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.788
You know what, fuck you.

35:46.790 --> 35:47.838
What was that?

35:47.840 --> 35:49.988
I said, fuck you.

35:49.990 --> 35:50.823
Prove it.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.533
Just get out.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.113
You are one crazy bitch.

36:00.220 --> 36:02.278
So, what did you have to tell me?

36:02.280 --> 36:03.824
Oh, right.

36:03.826 --> 36:05.768
Okay, so last night I couldn't sleep,

36:05.770 --> 36:06.948
so I ended up going on this walk.

36:06.950 --> 36:08.628
It was like 2AM or something

36:08.630 --> 36:11.781
and I ended up going past
Old Aunt Ethel's house

36:11.783 --> 36:15.765
and I went up and looked in
her window and she caught me.

36:15.767 --> 36:16.598
See saw you?

36:16.600 --> 36:17.617
Yeah, she asked if I was

36:17.619 --> 36:19.533
like trick-or-treating or something.

36:19.535 --> 36:20.366
Are you kidding me?

36:20.368 --> 36:21.848
Uh uh, and then she asked if I wanted

36:21.850 --> 36:24.308
any of her pickled chocolates.

36:24.310 --> 36:25.858
You didn't eat any, did you?

36:25.860 --> 36:26.808
No.

36:26.810 --> 36:27.641
Why?

36:27.643 --> 36:29.598
Because those are
chocolate-covered body parts.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.788
Oh, yeah right.

36:30.790 --> 36:34.478
I'm serious, everyone knows
about her picked chocolates.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.928
What are you looking for?

36:35.930 --> 36:36.998
My fucking weed.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.898
I bet my mom took it again.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.068
Mom, did you take my fucking weed again?!

36:41.070 --> 36:41.901
Fucking bitch!

36:41.903 --> 36:43.368
For the last time, Mandy,

36:43.370 --> 36:44.988
I did not take your weed!

36:44.990 --> 36:47.678
Yes you did, you stole my fucking weed!

36:47.680 --> 36:48.613
Fucking bitch!

36:49.696 --> 36:51.196
I hate that bitch!

36:57.320 --> 36:58.538
Hello.

36:58.540 --> 36:59.748
Hi.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.028
Hi.

37:01.030 --> 37:02.188
What are you doing?

37:02.190 --> 37:03.768
I just got to Joe's house.

37:03.770 --> 37:05.778
Will you come back here first?

37:05.780 --> 37:07.598
You just told me to leave, Mandy.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.778
I know but I need you back.

37:09.780 --> 37:10.797
Yeah, what do you want?

37:10.799 --> 37:13.068
What makes you think I want something?

37:13.070 --> 37:15.148
You don't want anything?

37:15.150 --> 37:16.618
Okay, yes.

37:16.620 --> 37:17.920
See, I fucking told you.

37:18.799 --> 37:21.228
Will you go to Breed's and
get some weed for me, please?

37:21.230 --> 37:23.068
Come on, Mandy, you know I
don't like going over there.

37:23.070 --> 37:24.293
He's fucking crazy.

37:39.575 --> 37:41.028
Were you followed?

37:41.030 --> 37:42.048
No, man.

37:42.050 --> 37:42.881
Did you circle the block

37:42.883 --> 37:44.798
to make sure them boys didn't follow you?

37:44.800 --> 37:45.700
Yeah, yeah dude.

37:49.160 --> 37:50.233

37:55.199 --> 37:56.947
All right, motherfucker,

37:56.949 --> 37:57.782
Hands up.

37:58.790 --> 37:59.848
You got anything on you?

37:59.850 --> 38:03.048
No, no, I jut want some weed, man.

38:03.050 --> 38:04.780
What'd you say, motherfucker?

38:07.850 --> 38:08.716
I just wondered...

38:08.718 --> 38:10.714
I know what you said but
why you saying it like that?

38:10.716 --> 38:11.547
You got a wire?

38:11.549 --> 38:12.768
No, I'm so sorry, dude!

38:12.770 --> 38:13.678
Is this thing real?

38:13.680 --> 38:15.308
Please don't kill me, please!

38:15.310 --> 38:17.189
I haven't had sex without a condom yet!

38:18.183 --> 38:20.633
And see if he has any
more of that White Tahoe.

Katie.

39:44.510 --> 39:45.343
No!

39:46.420 --> 39:47.263
Rachel.

39:48.910 --> 39:50.418
Yeah.

39:50.420 --> 39:53.828
You look like a Rachel,
that's who you are.

39:53.830 --> 39:54.703
Rachel.

39:58.058 --> 40:00.358
Hey, did you guys hear about Rachel?

40:00.360 --> 40:01.203
No, what?

40:02.110 --> 40:03.410
She went missing.

40:04.880 --> 40:05.818
No way.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.566
Yeah, she's been missing
for like three days.

40:08.568 --> 40:10.177
What happened to her?

40:11.960 --> 40:13.228
She went missing.

40:14.940 --> 40:16.171
No, like,

40:16.173 --> 40:18.623
like what do you think happened to her?

40:20.960 --> 40:21.868
This stupid bitch.

40:21.870 --> 40:23.998
I bet Aunt Ethel got her.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.251
Why?

40:25.253 --> 40:27.803
It's like, throughout
the whole month of October,

40:28.790 --> 40:30.388
people disappear.

40:30.390 --> 40:33.013
And sometimes you can
smell the bodies burning.

40:34.110 --> 40:35.268
What do you mean?

40:35.270 --> 40:37.008
So they say Aunt Ethel,

40:37.010 --> 40:40.818
the body parts that she doesn't
turn into Halloween treats,

40:40.820 --> 40:43.373
she burns in a big pile behind her barn.

40:45.150 --> 40:46.498
You're totally fucking with me.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.863
No, it's true.

40:48.994 --> 40:51.338
Did you tell her our plan yet?

40:51.340 --> 40:52.698
No, okay, so listen.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.378
Tomorrow night is Halloween, right?

40:55.380 --> 40:58.568
So we're gonna have a stakeout
at Aunt Ethel's house.

40:58.570 --> 41:01.120
Why would you want to
cook steak at Aunt Ethel's?

41:03.530 --> 41:06.168
No, a stakeout isn't when
you cook steak with someone,

41:06.170 --> 41:07.408
you fucking idiot!

41:07.410 --> 41:11.088
It's when you watch somebody,
like some investigative shit.

41:11.090 --> 41:12.988
Why would you wanna do that?

41:12.990 --> 41:14.153
We are doing that.

41:15.410 --> 41:17.388
Why would I wanna do that?

41:17.390 --> 41:18.768
Because, don't you wanna see

41:18.770 --> 41:20.628
what she really does with those kids?

41:20.630 --> 41:22.628
I'm sure she doesn't
do anything with them.

41:22.630 --> 41:24.448
Yeah she does.

41:24.450 --> 41:27.758
I heard that she scoops your
eyeballs out of your skull

41:27.760 --> 41:30.537
with a spoon and then she eats them.

41:30.539 --> 41:31.904
Oh, whatever.

41:39.260 --> 41:40.093
Well,

41:41.130 --> 41:41.963
Rach,

41:44.205 --> 41:47.678
I think it's time we head out to the barn.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.490
You just about warn out your welcome.

42:07.637 --> 42:10.637
Now hold still, it won't hurt a bit.

42:13.637 --> 42:14.637
Come on, oh!

42:15.533 --> 42:16.565
Shit!

42:16.567 --> 42:17.472
Damn!

42:17.474 --> 42:18.724
Son of a bitch!

42:19.926 --> 42:22.343
Come on, you slippery socket!

42:23.770 --> 42:25.147
Gosh!

42:25.149 --> 42:26.463
Piss!

42:26.465 --> 42:27.382
Damn!

42:27.384 --> 42:28.711
Bloody whore.

42:30.539 --> 42:31.539
Oh, damn it.

42:32.664 --> 42:33.824
Shit.

42:40.493 --> 42:41.326
Ah.

42:44.758 --> 42:45.591
Woo, baby.

42:47.210 --> 42:48.377
What a beauty.

42:51.067 --> 42:54.150
Oh, I can't wait to have you pickled.

43:01.157 --> 43:03.913
Mmmmm, you're already good.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.458
You're being ridiculous.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.598
So come with us and let's find out.

43:09.600 --> 43:10.978
Unless you're too scared.

43:10.980 --> 43:12.883
I'm not scared of a little old lady.

43:13.740 --> 43:14.845
You should be.

43:15.680 --> 43:16.511
Jesus!

43:16.513 --> 43:17.344
It's just my mom.

43:17.346 --> 43:18.498
What are you doing in here?

43:18.500 --> 43:20.228
Are you smoking weed in here, Mandy?

43:20.230 --> 43:22.078
No, Mom, get out!

43:22.080 --> 43:23.378
Oh, come on, let me get a little hit.

43:23.380 --> 43:25.448
Get the fuck out of my room, Mom!

43:25.450 --> 43:26.283
Whatever.

43:27.266 --> 43:28.794
Oh,

43:28.796 --> 43:30.585
hi Mark.

43:30.587 --> 43:32.118
Hi, Miss Cooper.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.613
Have you been working out?

43:35.322 --> 43:36.482
A little bit.

43:36.484 --> 43:37.368
Mmmmmm.

43:37.370 --> 43:39.158
I can tell.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.398
Gross, Mom, that's so weird.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.278
Get out of here!

43:41.280 --> 43:44.248
Don't be jealous, Mandy,
it's not attractive.

43:44.250 --> 43:45.728
Trust me, I'm not jealous.

43:45.730 --> 43:47.038
You're just gross.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.448
You are jealous because I'm a MILF.

43:49.450 --> 43:50.908
You're so not a MILF, Mom.

43:50.910 --> 43:52.573
I am a MILF, Mandy!

43:54.837 --> 43:55.958
I wish I never had you!

43:55.960 --> 43:57.518
God, what a bitch.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.758
I don't know, I
think she's pretty cool.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.016
Oh, fuck you, Mark.

45:05.393 --> 45:06.298
Hey!

45:06.300 --> 45:09.695
What're you doing, you
dirty little pervert!

45:11.753 --> 45:12.670
Oh, shit!

45:12.672 --> 45:14.255
Run, rabbit, run!

45:32.363 --> 45:34.196
Gotcha, little rabbit.

45:41.929 --> 45:43.418
So,

45:43.420 --> 45:44.673
here you are.

45:46.322 --> 45:47.763
Where do I start?

45:49.681 --> 45:50.514
Ah, yes.

46:18.390 --> 46:21.040
You won't be needing this anymore.

46:43.619 --> 46:44.536
Seven more.

47:12.891 --> 47:15.288
That girl just pushed
me, can I choke her out?

47:15.290 --> 47:16.748
What? No.

47:16.750 --> 47:18.418
Just got tell her it wasn't very nice

47:18.420 --> 47:19.953
and I won't play with her anymore.

47:27.850 --> 47:28.681
Hello.

47:28.683 --> 47:29.968
Hello, Melissa,
this is Ricky's mom.

47:29.970 --> 47:30.888
Oh, hi.

47:30.890 --> 47:32.528
Have you seen Ricky lately?

47:32.530 --> 47:34.348
No, I haven't seen him in a couple days.

47:34.350 --> 47:36.008
Well, he didn't
come home last night

47:36.010 --> 47:37.558
and we're getting worried.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.838
I'm sure he'll show up.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.500
Please let
me know if you see him.

47:40.502 --> 47:41.335
I will.

47:48.630 --> 47:49.461
Hello?

47:49.463 --> 47:50.568
Happy Halloween, bitch.

47:50.570 --> 47:52.168
You ready for our stakeout tonight?

47:52.170 --> 47:54.318
Hey, so Ricky's mom just called me

47:54.320 --> 47:55.748
and she hasn't seen him for a couple days.

47:55.750 --> 47:56.581
Have you?

47:56.583 --> 47:58.028
No, matter of fact,

47:58.030 --> 48:00.658
he didn't even jack-off
outside my window last night.

48:00.660 --> 48:01.493
What?

48:02.600 --> 48:03.431
Hold on, Gio.

48:03.433 --> 48:04.468
I'm sure he's fine.

48:04.470 --> 48:07.308
Well, if you see him, let him
know that his mom's worried.

48:07.310 --> 48:08.958
Hey, so what're you doing today?

48:08.960 --> 48:09.998
You wanna go shopping?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.158
I can't, I'm at the park right now

48:11.160 --> 48:12.610
babysitting my little nephew.

48:13.500 --> 48:14.838
Hold on, Gio!

48:14.840 --> 48:16.848
Okay, well call me
when you get home then.

48:16.850 --> 48:18.113
Okay, I will, bye.

48:19.490 --> 48:20.528
Jesus, Gio!

48:20.530 --> 48:22.648
When I'm on the phone,
don't bother me like that.

48:22.650 --> 48:23.718
What's up?

48:23.720 --> 48:25.188
I chocked her out.

48:25.190 --> 48:26.423
Oh, shit, come on.

48:32.500 --> 48:33.333
Six more.

48:34.287 --> 48:38.078
Six more, six more.

48:40.481 --> 48:42.101
All right.

48:42.103 --> 48:44.669
I think I got everything we need.

48:44.671 --> 48:46.495
We got handcuffs,

48:46.497 --> 48:47.618
rope,

48:47.620 --> 48:48.575
zip ties.

48:48.577 --> 48:49.720
We got the gun

48:52.620 --> 48:53.453
and an apple.

48:54.586 --> 48:57.169
What's the apple for?

48:58.460 --> 49:00.288
I don't know, it was already there.

49:00.290 --> 49:01.740
Oh, right, that's my apple.

49:07.380 --> 49:08.211
Who is it?

49:08.213 --> 49:09.528
Melissa.

49:09.530 --> 49:11.001
Oh shit, put this stuff away, quick.

49:11.003 --> 49:12.124
What, you didn't tell her?

49:12.126 --> 49:13.619
No, now shut up and put it away.

49:13.621 --> 49:14.454
What?

49:16.890 --> 49:17.723
- Hey.
- Hi.

49:19.480 --> 49:20.313
What's up?

49:21.180 --> 49:23.478
What's up with you guys?

49:23.480 --> 49:24.313
Nothing.

49:26.300 --> 49:27.133
Yeah, nothing.

49:28.740 --> 49:30.553
You guys are weird.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.808
Now what?

49:54.810 --> 49:56.141
We wait.

49:56.143 --> 49:56.974
Wait for what?

49:56.976 --> 49:59.508
We wait for her to take
a couple of kids inside

49:59.510 --> 50:02.288
and then we see what she
really does with them.

50:02.290 --> 50:04.178
And what if she doesn't?

50:04.180 --> 50:05.013
Oh, she will.

50:06.130 --> 50:06.963
She will.

50:14.180 --> 50:15.448
Mandy, you've been really quiet.

50:15.450 --> 50:16.283
You okay?

50:17.120 --> 50:18.703
Yeah, I'm fine.

50:27.890 --> 50:29.458
Okay, this is boring.

50:29.460 --> 50:30.638
Could we play some music or something?

50:30.640 --> 50:31.488
No!

50:31.490 --> 50:32.323
Fuck!

50:33.790 --> 50:35.668
There aren't even any
trick-or-treaters out.

50:35.670 --> 50:36.698
That's because most people know

50:36.700 --> 50:38.308
about Old Aunt Ethel, okay?

50:38.310 --> 50:40.398
Kids don't come around
this block very often

50:40.400 --> 50:42.930
but there's always that one.

50:46.667 --> 50:48.243
And there he is.

50:55.065 --> 50:56.301
Trick 'r treat.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.664
Well, hello there.

51:01.693 --> 51:03.276
Okay, here we go.

51:09.138 --> 51:09.969
See?

51:09.971 --> 51:10.802
I told you!

51:10.804 --> 51:11.637
I fucking told you!

51:13.090 --> 51:14.084
He could come back out.

51:14.086 --> 51:16.919
Oh no, they never come back out.

51:27.884 --> 51:30.134
He's been in there
for like 10 minutes now.

51:32.775 --> 51:33.828
Look.

51:33.830 --> 51:34.730
Look, another kid.

51:43.631 --> 51:45.048
Trick or treat.

51:46.160 --> 51:48.323
Well look at you.

51:49.595 --> 51:51.678
Don't you look delicious.

51:52.622 --> 51:55.118
I mean, scary.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.924
Are you a little witch?

51:56.926 --> 51:57.843
Yeah.

51:57.845 --> 52:00.928
I just love witches.

52:00.930 --> 52:03.233
Do you know any magic spells?

52:03.235 --> 52:04.267
No.

52:04.269 --> 52:05.938
Well guess what,

52:05.940 --> 52:08.954
I know a real magic spell.

52:08.956 --> 52:10.615
Do you wanna see it?

52:10.617 --> 52:11.448
Yeah.

52:11.450 --> 52:14.012
Come inside and I'll show you.

52:17.740 --> 52:19.718
And there's another
one that's not going home

52:19.720 --> 52:21.070
to Mommy and Daddy tonight.

52:25.436 --> 52:26.668
Okay.

52:26.670 --> 52:27.578
Let's do this.

52:27.580 --> 52:28.468
Do what?

52:28.470 --> 52:30.558
Listen, I didn't tell you
everything about tonight

52:30.560 --> 52:32.803
but now you see why we have to do this.

52:32.805 --> 52:33.636
Do what?

52:33.638 --> 52:35.228
Mandy, what are you talking about?

52:35.230 --> 52:37.438
We're going to kill Old Aunt Ethel.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.188
I'm gonna blow her fucking head off.

52:39.190 --> 52:40.398
Calm down, Mark.

52:40.400 --> 52:42.408
You guys are crazy, you can't kill her.

52:42.410 --> 52:43.241
Why?

52:43.243 --> 52:45.078
She's killing poor,
innocent children, Melissa.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.158
How can you let that happen?

52:46.160 --> 52:47.448
We have to call the police.

52:47.450 --> 52:48.598
Those kids will be fucking dead

52:48.600 --> 52:51.328
before those cops ever get
here with a search warrant.

52:51.330 --> 52:53.008
I'm gonna blow her fucking head off.

52:53.010 --> 52:55.978
I can't do this, I
can't fucking kill her.

52:58.752 --> 53:00.253
Look, there's a kid at the door.

53:04.792 --> 53:06.209
Trick or treat.

53:07.436 --> 53:09.222
That's my nephew, Gio!

53:09.224 --> 53:10.057
Gio!

53:12.698 --> 53:14.588
You can't go running up
there, screaming like that.

53:14.590 --> 53:15.557
You'll never see him again.

53:15.559 --> 53:16.438
Let go of me.

53:16.440 --> 53:17.347
Listen to me.

53:17.349 --> 53:19.283
Look at me, you dumb bitch!

53:20.207 --> 53:22.448
There's a right way to do this, okay?

53:22.450 --> 53:24.368
We're gonna save your nephew, I promise,

53:24.370 --> 53:25.918
but not like this.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.913
I need you to calm down and trust me.

53:29.620 --> 53:32.488
So, look at "Miss
Toughy Pants" now, huh?

53:32.490 --> 53:34.588
Just a second ago you didn't
want anything to do with this.

53:34.590 --> 53:35.421
Now look at you.

53:35.423 --> 53:37.048
It's different, Mandy,
she has my nephew.

53:37.050 --> 53:39.708
It's always someone's
nephew, someone's brother.

53:39.710 --> 53:41.138
Someone's sister.

53:41.140 --> 53:42.198
It's funny how everything changes

53:42.200 --> 53:44.078
when it's your own family, isn't it?

53:44.080 --> 53:46.628
Well, I know exactly
how it feels, Melissa.

53:46.630 --> 53:48.280
Aunt Ethel took a sister from me.

53:49.870 --> 53:51.370
She took my brother from me.

53:53.011 --> 53:54.208
Guys, I didn't know.

53:54.210 --> 53:55.423
I'm so sorry.

54:00.432 --> 54:02.558
You ready to kill this fucking bitch?

54:02.560 --> 54:04.110
I'm ready to kill this bitch.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.483
Let's kill this bitch.

54:30.497 --> 54:31.330
Gio.

54:39.003 --> 54:43.528
You can't cause a seen
by letting him see you.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.258
If he starts screaming and yelling,

54:45.260 --> 54:46.578
Aunt Ethel's gonna come out here

54:46.580 --> 54:48.708
and we're gonna lose
out chance to end this

54:48.710 --> 54:49.687
once and for all.

54:51.363 --> 54:53.363
We're going to save him,

54:54.578 --> 54:55.411
okay?

54:58.359 --> 54:59.889
Come on.

55:17.455 --> 55:20.128
All right, all you have to do

55:20.130 --> 55:22.400
is wait for me to get inside.

55:23.432 --> 55:24.886
Okay?

55:24.888 --> 55:27.121
Then you're gonna knock on the front door

55:27.123 --> 55:29.268
and distract Aunt Ethel.

55:29.270 --> 55:32.638
She's gonna think it's trick-or-treaters.

55:32.640 --> 55:34.896
When she opens the door,

55:34.898 --> 55:35.731
bang,

55:36.673 --> 55:39.006
I blow her fucking head off.

55:42.144 --> 55:43.311
You guys okay?

55:45.424 --> 55:46.257
Hey.

55:47.212 --> 55:48.959
I got this.

55:48.961 --> 55:50.128
Just trust me.

55:52.167 --> 55:53.084
I love you.

56:05.781 --> 56:07.488
What are you girls doing there?!

56:07.490 --> 56:08.340
Nothing.

56:09.380 --> 56:10.213
Hey,

56:11.080 --> 56:13.243
you're that girl from the other night.

56:15.380 --> 56:18.038
And you brought a friend with you?

56:18.040 --> 56:19.138
Yeah.

56:19.140 --> 56:20.619
Trick-or-treat.

56:20.621 --> 56:21.795
Well,

56:21.797 --> 56:24.863
I'm so glad you came back.

56:25.730 --> 56:29.633
I have some delicious treats inside.

56:30.670 --> 56:31.503
Come with me.

56:45.658 --> 56:46.491
Mmmm.

56:49.073 --> 56:49.906
Sit.

56:50.938 --> 56:51.771
Sit.

57:02.164 --> 57:02.997
So,

57:04.050 --> 57:05.250
where are your costumes?

57:08.110 --> 57:10.758
I'm dressed as her
and she's dressed as me.

57:10.760 --> 57:11.591
Yeah.

57:11.593 --> 57:13.373
We were trying to be funny.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.433
Not impressed.

57:19.775 --> 57:20.608
Mmmmm.

57:26.013 --> 57:27.013
Mmmmm-mmmmm.

57:28.360 --> 57:32.173
Care for some of my famous
homemade pickled chocolates?

57:33.120 --> 57:33.951
No, thank you.

57:33.953 --> 57:36.588
We've already eaten so much candy tonight.

57:36.590 --> 57:38.743
Well don't look disgusted.

57:39.920 --> 57:41.681
They're delicious.

57:41.683 --> 57:42.971
Mmmmm.

57:42.973 --> 57:43.806
Hey!

57:44.671 --> 57:45.504
Hey!

57:46.906 --> 57:47.739
Oh my God.

57:49.844 --> 57:51.427
Dude, we're fucked.

57:53.994 --> 57:56.968
I can never get enough of 'em.

57:56.970 --> 57:57.803
Oh man.

57:59.371 --> 58:01.621
Mmmmm, mmmmmm, mmmm, mmmmm.

58:02.526 --> 58:03.609
Hey!

58:04.633 --> 58:06.572
Hey, what the fuck?!

58:06.574 --> 58:09.241
I can never get enough of 'em.

58:10.635 --> 58:12.052
They are so good.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.833
I make 'em myself, you know.

58:16.900 --> 58:17.733
Homemade.

58:34.370 --> 58:36.070
Can I use your bathroom, please?

58:38.480 --> 58:39.311
Yeah.

58:39.313 --> 58:40.740
Sure, it's in the back, there.

58:41.910 --> 58:43.118
Come with me, Melissa.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.256
I'm gonna go
with her, if that's okay?

58:45.258 --> 58:46.091
Mmhmmm.

58:50.550 --> 58:52.548
What are we gonna do?

58:52.550 --> 58:54.000
I don't know, I don't know.

58:54.910 --> 58:56.308
Let's just climb out this window.

58:56.310 --> 58:57.988
No, we can't leave without Gio.

58:57.990 --> 58:59.113
Right, okay.

59:00.010 --> 59:01.308
Think, think, think.

59:01.310 --> 59:02.983
Look for anything we can use as a weapon.

59:02.985 --> 59:03.818
Okay.

59:10.130 --> 59:11.298
Did you find anything yet?

59:11.300 --> 59:13.892
Not unless we can use a
toothbrush or a toilet brush.

59:14.950 --> 59:17.148
You girls all right in there?

59:17.150 --> 59:18.908
Yeah, we'll be right out.

59:18.910 --> 59:21.797
Well, you
have some company here.

59:21.799 --> 59:22.921
Company?

59:22.923 --> 59:26.300
Yes, your friend is here to see you.

59:45.190 --> 59:47.188
Okay, okay!

59:47.190 --> 59:48.758
Sit, sit, sit.

59:48.760 --> 59:51.398
He wants it to be a surprise.

59:51.400 --> 59:54.643
Yes, he wants it to be a surprise!

59:55.940 --> 59:59.713
Stay right there and I'll be right back.

01:00:05.784 --> 01:00:08.643
Look who's here to save you.

01:00:08.645 --> 01:00:10.062
Isn't that sweet?

01:00:11.097 --> 01:00:11.930
Awwwww.

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:14.862
"Hey,

01:00:14.864 --> 01:00:16.795
"look at me.

01:00:16.797 --> 01:00:19.865
"I'm the coolest kid in school

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:23.271
"and I'm here to save you."

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.328
He's here to save you.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.328
Mark?

01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:32.603
Oh, right.

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:35.153
So, listen,

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.968
I slit this throat.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:41.768
He's only got about 15 seconds to live.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:44.998
So, little girls, you got
anything you wanna say?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.203
Mark, I'm so sorry.

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:49.233
You know what?

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.063
Yep.

01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:55.203
I was wrong.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.238
He's dead.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.631
He didn't hear a word you said.

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.981
Fucking bitch!

01:01:05.983 --> 01:01:07.078
You're fucking dead!

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.238
No so fast, sunshine.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.758
Does this look familiar?

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.323
Your little friend here
said I could have it.

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:19.618
I've never had a gun before.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.983
I can't wait to try it out.

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:24.038
You having fun, buddy?

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:24.929
Yeah.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.414
Hey, let's check out the next house.

01:01:31.163 --> 01:01:32.328
Hey, hey!

01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:34.578
Calm the hell down, buttercup,

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:37.018
unless you want me to
lay you down beside her.

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:37.935
Is that what you want?

01:01:37.937 --> 01:01:39.558
No, no.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.793
Well then get a hold of yourself.

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:45.948
Get up.

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:47.523
Come on, get over here.

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:53.882
Get up and get your ass over here.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.138
Push your little friend
here out of the chair

01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.698
and sit down in it.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.358
What?

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.839
Oh, is this too hard?

01:02:02.841 --> 01:02:07.233
Push him out of the
chair and sit down in it.

01:02:09.176 --> 01:02:10.009
Oh.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.825
Would you put some muscle into it?

01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:18.530
Oh, for Lord's sakes, let me.

01:02:20.818 --> 01:02:22.058
Now, was that too hard?

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.183
Now sit down!

01:02:24.586 --> 01:02:27.297
What are you going to do?

01:02:29.196 --> 01:02:30.928
Little poor baby.

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:34.268
Listen, don't take it too personal.

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:36.298
You're taking it too hard.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.635
Please don't do this.

01:02:38.637 --> 01:02:40.624
"Please don't.

01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:41.876
"Please don't."

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:46.753
There is good news.

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:52.338
I need to deliver 31 souls.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:57.340
You get to end it
because you're number 31.

01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:58.723
What do you mean?

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.263
Do you believe in witches?

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.498
No.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.378
How about curses and evil spells?

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.568
No.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:10.573
Well you should.

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:15.688
On this very day, 40 years ago,

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:18.663
a witch put a curse on me.

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:22.948
I need to deliver 31 souls

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.718
for every day that dead walk.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.758
And you, little bunny,

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.053
make 31.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.998
If I make 31, then Gio's 32.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.740
You don't have to kill Gio.

01:03:35.742 --> 01:03:36.575
Who?

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.188
There's a little boy in your barn.

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:43.118
His name is Gio and he's my nephew.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.578
If I'm 31 then he's 32 and
you don't have to kill him.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:50.638
Please, just take me and let him go.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:51.566
Yeah, sure.

01:03:51.568 --> 01:03:53.258
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.668
How will I know you'll
let him go if I'm dead?

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:58.208
You'll just have to trust me.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.128
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:01.098
Jesus Christ, just wait a second!

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:03.908
Oh, come on!

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:06.168
I'm dying to use this thing again.

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:08.562
Please, there must be another way.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.563
Trick or treat.

01:04:46.679 --> 01:04:48.415
Okay, it's done.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.618
There's your 31st soul.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.223
Can we go home now, please?

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.933
I forgot to mention one little thing.

01:04:59.936 --> 01:05:00.767
What?

01:05:00.769 --> 01:05:02.438
What, are you going to let us go?

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.303
Oh, you can go.

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.693
Then why are you laughing?

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.948
The only way my curse

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.420
could ever be broken

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:22.400
is if someone else offered
to take the 31st soul for me.

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:26.303
What?

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.410
You

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:34.493
took the 31st soul for the dead.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.530
What does that mean?

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:41.920
Well that means that you

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.615
are the cursed one now.

01:05:50.422 --> 01:05:51.255
No.

01:05:53.359 --> 01:05:54.192
No.

01:06:09.637 --> 01:06:10.470
Aaah!

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.528

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:15.363
or less,

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.808
you will receive a message.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:23.573
It will tell you everything
you need to know.

01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:31.564
Oh my God, it was just a dream.

01:06:31.566 --> 01:06:32.649
Jesus Christ.

01:08:07.859 --> 01:08:08.692
No.

01:08:09.967 --> 01:08:11.050
No.

01:12:55.642 --> 01:12:56.473
Hey!

01:12:56.475 --> 01:12:58.088
What're you girls doing there?!

01:12:58.090 --> 01:12:59.750
Nothing.

01:12:59.752 --> 01:13:00.644
Hey.

01:13:01.479 --> 01:13:02.971
It just went right in her mouth.

01:13:02.973 --> 01:13:03.804
Ew.

01:13:03.806 --> 01:13:04.887
I watch it go right.

01:13:04.889 --> 01:13:06.118
What went in her mouth?

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.277
A bug just went.

01:13:08.279 --> 01:13:10.599
I watched her spit it out.

01:13:10.601 --> 01:13:12.317
She just went, phew.

01:13:20.911 --> 01:13:22.995
All right, now listen up, motherfuckers.

01:13:22.997 --> 01:13:23.828
Ya know what I mean?

01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:24.661
Hey.

01:13:27.514 --> 01:13:28.568
Hey.

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.124
Hey.

01:13:30.126 --> 01:13:31.471
What's up?

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:35.302
Get it together.

01:13:35.304 --> 01:13:37.136
Close the door.

01:13:45.405 --> 01:13:48.828
Holy shit, that's gonna
be so fucking funny.

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:51.248
So where are you looking at, that light?

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:53.908
I'm looking at Austin's nipples.

01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:54.741
I'm serious.

01:13:54.743 --> 01:13:55.678
Yeah.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.528
No, I'm serious.

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:57.608
That's like where I'm looking,

01:13:57.610 --> 01:14:00.638
is right, ironically,
where his nipples are.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.898
Okay, nipples, got it.

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:05.679
Right, so from Joe's
nipples to Austin's nipples.

01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:06.817
That's my nephew, Gio!

01:14:06.819 --> 01:14:07.652
Gio!

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.191
It's looked.

01:14:13.541 --> 01:14:15.124
And action.

01:14:17.779 --> 01:14:18.610
Come in.

01:14:18.612 --> 01:14:20.482

I'm sorry.

01:14:28.573 --> 01:14:29.490
And

01:14:30.729 --> 01:14:31.562
action.

01:14:33.992 --> 01:14:35.987
Ugh.
