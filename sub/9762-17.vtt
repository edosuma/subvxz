00:08.342 --> 00:12.711
Yamu and Spopovitch
had stolen Gohan's energy,

00:12.930 --> 00:17.264
and were headed toward the Madoshi Babidi.

00:17.476 --> 00:18.682
Goku and the others,

00:18.894 --> 00:21.135
who were following after them
along with Kaioshin,

00:21.355 --> 00:24.768
had at last located the enemy hideout.

01:55.032 --> 02:01.528
"The Nefarious Madoshi Babidi and King of
the Demon Realm of Darkness Dabra's Trap.â€˜l

02:03.457 --> 02:04.742
Dabra!

02:04.958 --> 02:06.744
It can't be! Dabra?!

02:06.960 --> 02:12.671
B-Babidi even has the King of
the Demon Realm in his power?

02:15.385 --> 02:18.252
Dabra? Which one? The big one?

02:18.472 --> 02:19.382
Correct.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.806
Is he that awesome? That guy?

02:23.018 --> 02:25.225
Of course he is.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.929
After all, he is King of the
Demon Realm of Darkness.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.312
A-And what is the Demon Realm of Darkness?

02:32.528 --> 02:36.646
On the underside of this world,
there lies yet another world.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.824
In this world, the number-one
contender is probably one of you,

02:41.036 --> 02:44.745
but in the other, demon world,
the top contender is definitely Dabra.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.289
Eep! King of the Demon Realm, you say?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.412
You mean, a world like that exists?

02:49.628 --> 02:53.166
I'll just bet he's an incredibly
tough opponent, isn't he?

02:53.382 --> 02:54.838
That's no fair!

02:55.050 --> 02:59.043
Then that means the smaller one
over there is Madoshi Babidi?

02:59.263 --> 03:00.298
Correct.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.677
Him, huh? That's the guy?

03:03.892 --> 03:06.429
Indeed, he is almost all but powerless,

03:06.645 --> 03:10.684
but he uses horrific magic,
so by no means underestimate him.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.982
Magic so powerful, he even has
Dabra there under his control.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.027
You're saying that Babidi's
magic is strong enough

03:17.239 --> 03:20.276
to make even the head guy of
the demon realm yield to him?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.608
No, I think he is probably exploiting

03:22.828 --> 03:25.695
the evil and greed in his heart,
and is using that

03:25.914 --> 03:27.290
to control him at will.

03:27.499 --> 03:31.492
In that sense, Dabra is the
perfect henchman for him.

03:31.712 --> 03:35.421
The truth is, that is Babidi's
most fearsome magic spell.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.419
Yamu, Spopovitch, and his other henchmen

03:38.635 --> 03:40.546
are all controlled by that magic.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.378
That is why only those like us and yourselves,

03:43.599 --> 03:46.932
who don't have any evil in our hearts,
can fight against him.

03:47.144 --> 03:50.602
l have to admit, though, I never
expected Dabra to be with him!

03:50.814 --> 03:53.726
The combo of Babidi and Dabra
together is just too...

03:53.942 --> 03:57.025
Are you trying to say our chances
of victory have greatly fallen?

03:58.238 --> 04:02.026
Hmph! lf Majin Boo is revived,
the world will come to an end, huh?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.826
I won't let that happen. I am not
going to be beaten by those guys!

04:06.038 --> 04:09.826
Th-This is bad news, all right.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.533
Kuririn, you'd better head back.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.334
This is a lot worse than we thought.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.958
|-| think I might do just that.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.755
This doesn't seem to be at the level
where I can be of any help.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.426
Besides, it ain't been that much time
since you got married, huh?

04:23.639 --> 04:28.599
Y-Yeah. I've got a wife and
cute daughter to think about.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.721
Okay, I hate to do this, but...

04:31.980 --> 04:36.690
Ho ho! This is full of energy, is it?

04:36.902 --> 04:39.063
Y-Yes!

04:47.829 --> 04:53.074
You've done well. We are now
much closer to Majin Boo's return.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.957
Hey, with our powers, this job
was so easy, it was nothing at all.

04:58.173 --> 05:02.086
Oh, yeah? Well, l have no further use for you.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.753
"Boom!" I love that sound,
every time I hear it, you know?

05:47.973 --> 05:50.089
Yes, I do, too.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.141
Well then, I will see to this one.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.690
Puipui, do you want a try?

06:00.902 --> 06:02.403
Yes!

06:16.043 --> 06:18.250
Nice shot!

06:21.757 --> 06:25.750
Th-Their own men...!
What monsters these guys are!

06:32.768 --> 06:38.058
Weren't those last expressions on
Yamu and Spopovitch's faces pathetic?

06:38.273 --> 06:42.391
But then, seeing faces like those
is one of my favorite things.

06:43.987 --> 06:47.445
You will be able to see many
faces like that here on Earth.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.397
Yes, you're right.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.618
Brutal, huh?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.449
What a bunch of fiends.

06:59.669 --> 07:04.083
That is how he--how Madoshi Babidi works.

07:04.299 --> 07:08.042
Babidi brings the brawniest
warriors from all over,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.513
and with his magic, makes them obey him.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.223
Then when he has no further use for them,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.809
he tosses them away like garbage.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.680
He's planning to do the same thing this time,

07:23.193 --> 07:24.808
Well then, Dabra...

07:25.028 --> 07:26.268
Sir?

07:26.488 --> 07:29.104
Sure enough, just as I expected,

07:29.324 --> 07:33.112
Yamu and the other one brought
lots of prey to us, didn't they?

07:34.412 --> 07:39.873
Together with the Kaioshin who,
so long ago, killed my father...

07:41.086 --> 07:43.873
They seem to think they're hiding.

07:47.092 --> 07:51.335
In all... seven of them.

07:51.555 --> 07:55.673
Even assuming that Kaioshin and
Kibito's energy will be unusable,

07:55.892 --> 07:59.009
three of them seem to possess
the outstanding energy

07:59.229 --> 08:02.392
that we require to revive Majin Boo.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.474
So it seems. Even with those three alone,

08:05.694 --> 08:09.357
we should be able to obtain
more than enough energy.

08:12.617 --> 08:16.860
Who would have imagined that
we could revive Majin Boo so soon?

08:19.082 --> 08:22.540
Luring those three inside the spaceship

08:22.752 --> 08:26.290
is the surest way of absorbing
their energy, right?

08:26.506 --> 08:30.249
Yes. However, Kaioshin will
not likely allow that.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.710
If you mop up the other scum
aside from those three,

08:33.929 --> 08:37.013
and then come back inside the ship
right away, those three will snap,

08:37.225 --> 08:40.261
and are sure to follow you inside, I believe.

08:40.477 --> 08:45.472
lndeed. Hmph... That is what my role is, then?

08:45.692 --> 08:49.310
That's right. But don't take out Kaioshin, okay?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.236
l have to pay him back for my father.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.486
Afterward, I'm going to
kill him nice and slowly.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.444
As you wish, Babidi-sama.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.995
I will save the best part for you.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.199
Okay, I'll leave it to you, then.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.919
Yes, sir.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.711
Babidi-sama, what about me?

09:12.928 --> 09:16.261
Puipui, Dabra can handle this all on his own.

09:16.473 --> 09:21.092
You come back inside, too.
I'll let you handle the first stage.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.769
R-Right!

09:28.026 --> 09:32.235
Huh? Theyjust left Dabra behind,
and went back inside.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.659
Well then, let's do this.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.748
He knows we're here!

10:05.563 --> 10:06.348
Kibito!

10:06.564 --> 10:08.065
Kibito-san!

10:14.656 --> 10:16.237
Damn it!

10:31.840 --> 10:33.421
Watch out!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.544
Oh, no! If his saliva touches you...!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.261
What?!

10:38.555 --> 10:39.886
Why, you...!

10:40.098 --> 10:41.588
Hey!

10:55.155 --> 10:56.645
Kuririn-san!

11:15.425 --> 11:17.256
Kuririn! Piccolo!

11:19.929 --> 11:22.261
Piccolo!

11:22.474 --> 11:23.338
What's going on?!

11:23.558 --> 11:26.300
Th-They're stone...!

11:26.519 --> 11:30.262
Everyone that Dabra's saliva
touches turns to stone.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.222
They what?

11:32.442 --> 11:33.978
--Piccolo!
--Don't!

11:34.194 --> 11:35.559
You must not touch him!

11:35.779 --> 11:36.939
Why not?!

11:37.155 --> 11:39.487
If you touch them, and happen to break them,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.111
then neither of them can ever
be returned to normal again!

11:42.327 --> 11:44.818
O-Oh, no...

11:45.038 --> 11:46.619
Damn...!

11:49.542 --> 11:51.123
Damn you!

11:52.504 --> 11:57.669
Go on and get out of here!
Nobody can defy Babidi-sama!

12:24.285 --> 12:27.368
K-Kuririn-san...

12:27.580 --> 12:29.081
Piccolo-san...!

12:31.084 --> 12:33.871
Kaioshin-sama! You said a
moment ago that if we break them,

12:34.087 --> 12:36.453
they couldn't be returned to normal, huh?

12:36.673 --> 12:40.131
Then there is a way to return
the two of them to normal, right?

12:40.343 --> 12:42.425
W-Well, yes...

12:42.637 --> 12:45.925
...but not until Dabra is dead.

12:47.100 --> 12:52.220
Oh, then there is a way, ain't there?
One that's nice and simple!

12:52.439 --> 12:55.727
Let's go, Father! Either way, we're going, right?

12:55.942 --> 12:57.853
We have to save Kuririn-san and Piccolo-san!

12:58.069 --> 13:00.151
Of course we are. Let's go!

13:02.031 --> 13:05.489
Just a moment! We cannot fall
for the enemy's strategy!

13:06.786 --> 13:10.529
If you enter the enemy's ship,
you will play right into their hands!

13:10.748 --> 13:12.909
Let's wait a while longer to see what happens!

13:13.126 --> 13:16.664
I can't afford to leave
Kuririn and Piccolo like that!

13:16.880 --> 13:18.461
Me either!

13:20.341 --> 13:22.002
Sorry.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.426
We're not very good at waiting patiently.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.674
Tch...

13:34.647 --> 13:36.683
For crying out loud!

13:57.712 --> 13:58.997
All right, let's go.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.704
Right.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.645
Here they come, here they come!

14:18.858 --> 14:21.941
They really are simple fools, aren't they?

14:35.166 --> 14:39.125
What is this place?
This is an awfully plain room, huh?

14:39.337 --> 14:41.419
There's just the one doorway over there.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.041
Let's break it down and go through.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.748
Mm-hmm.

14:48.263 --> 14:52.552
Ha! Hey, Kaioshin-sama, you finally came, too?

14:52.767 --> 14:55.429
Only because all of you
are acting so recklessly!

14:59.190 --> 15:02.774
Once you enter this ship,
you can never leave it again.

15:02.986 --> 15:06.399
--Huh?
--Probably not until Babidi is defeated.

15:06.614 --> 15:12.109
Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just
have to defeat Babidi, right?

15:13.955 --> 15:17.163
If it comes to it, I'll destroy the whole ship.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.162
You mustn't! If you deliver any strong shocks,

15:20.378 --> 15:22.494
it will awaken Majin Boo!

15:22.714 --> 15:26.548
You people are all treating
Babidi and Majin Boo too lightly!

15:26.759 --> 15:30.047
Even if Majin Boo's energy
isn't completely restored,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.925
he will still have enough
destructive power to kill us,

15:33.141 --> 15:36.804
and bring ruin to the Earth
in a short amount of time!

15:40.732 --> 15:44.691
So Kaioshin is here, too. Terrific!

15:46.154 --> 15:48.896
l have to say, this is one bleak room.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.285
Babidi-sama... Babidi-sama...?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.158
Oh, Puipui?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.161
Yes. Is it not about time, already?

16:01.377 --> 16:04.494
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting.

16:04.714 --> 16:08.081
Okay, go ahead and take
their energy from them.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.508
Right! Just leave it to me!

16:16.142 --> 16:21.933
Whoops, I forgot. I have to go
infuse this energy, right away.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.609
Come along, Dabra.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.608
We know how that will end up
without having to watch them.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.485
R-Right.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.543
I'm so glad you're here. This is the first stage.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.465
First stage?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.088
What does that mean?

16:53.304 --> 16:56.637
Babidi-sama is on the very bottom floor.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.591
However, you must pass
through a number of these stages

16:59.811 --> 17:01.642
and defeat the warriors that appear in them,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.719
or you cannot proceed downward.

17:04.898 --> 17:09.814
Here in the first stage,
your opponent is me. In other words...

17:10.029 --> 17:13.021
You guys are all finished here!

17:18.871 --> 17:21.657
Nah, I don't think that's likely.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.375
Hmm?

17:44.355 --> 17:46.061
W-What's this?!

17:46.274 --> 17:48.606
After just once, there is this much energy?!

17:48.818 --> 17:51.810
We've already gathered
nearly half of it, all in one shot!

17:52.029 --> 17:53.530
We've done what?

17:55.616 --> 17:58.403
How many hundreds of people
did Yamu and Spopovitch

17:58.619 --> 18:00.325
collect this energy from?

18:00.538 --> 18:03.450
I do not know. I did not ask them.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.746
Tch...

18:04.959 --> 18:09.578
If they could get this vast amount
of energy in so short a time,

18:09.797 --> 18:12.288
then maybe I shouldn't have killed them, huh?

18:14.010 --> 18:16.126
Oh, it will be all right.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.553
Once we collect the energy
from the three in Stage One,

18:19.766 --> 18:23.133
I believe it will be nearly completely filled.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.343
|f Majin Boo's revival goes successfully,

18:25.563 --> 18:28.145
it should be realized within the day.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.434
That is the whole reason why
I lured them in here, after all.

18:32.653 --> 18:38.319
Now then, I wonder if Puipui
has taken all three of them yet.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.365
Let's go, Dabra.

18:40.578 --> 18:41.943
Let's have a look...

18:42.163 --> 18:45.496
Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!...

18:45.708 --> 18:48.916
Huh? What is this?
They haven't started fighting yet?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.369
Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

18:51.589 --> 18:55.173
Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!...

19:00.139 --> 19:03.927
Huh? W-What are those guys doing?

19:04.143 --> 19:09.137
Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

19:10.608 --> 19:11.393
I did it!

19:11.609 --> 19:13.645
Tch! Nice one, Vegeta.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.352
All right, I go first.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.857
U-Um...

19:18.074 --> 19:21.191
A-Are you planning to fight him alone?!

19:21.410 --> 19:25.244
Obviously. I'm more than a match for that guy.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.875
Babidi-sama told me to watch out,

19:32.088 --> 19:35.080
since you guys have powerful energy...

19:35.299 --> 19:37.631
...but it looks like you're just a bunch of idiots!

19:37.844 --> 19:40.711
Are you sure this Babidi guy
isn't the real idiot?

19:40.930 --> 19:44.047
He's going to regret not doing his homework.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.428
Who knew that the strongest guy
in the whole world

19:46.644 --> 19:48.760
would be right here on Earth, of all places?

19:48.980 --> 19:51.221
The strongest?

19:55.486 --> 19:58.273
You really are a full-fledged idiot!

19:58.489 --> 20:00.480
You mustn't underestimate the enemy!

20:02.118 --> 20:05.531
Babidi only gathers the
strongest warriors around,

20:05.746 --> 20:07.361
and makes them his men!

20:07.582 --> 20:12.702
Now, now, it'll be okay.
Just let Vegeta handle this.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.421
But...

20:15.548 --> 20:18.005
There is no escape for you from this place now!

20:18.217 --> 20:22.961
And the damage you take will be
absorbed as energy by this room,

20:23.180 --> 20:26.923
which is set up to lead straight to the ball
that Majin Boo-sama is sealed inside!

20:27.143 --> 20:29.384
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

20:29.604 --> 20:33.347
So that means that if I take no damage,
you can't take any energy, right?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.272
That's what it means!

20:35.484 --> 20:39.068
But unfortunately for you,
that is an impossibility!

20:39.280 --> 20:41.862
Not as long as I'm in here!

20:42.950 --> 20:45.362
Hmph, you're an annoying little pest.

20:48.581 --> 20:52.790
That's enough of your gabbing.
Let's hurry and get this over with.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.958
Come and get me.

20:58.174 --> 21:01.041
This Vegeta lad...

21:15.399 --> 21:16.980
Vegeta-san...

21:26.369 --> 21:30.453
The battle in the first stage is about to begin!

21:30.665 --> 21:34.283
Vegeta seems to be brimming
with confidence. However...

22:42.236 --> 22:43.817
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:44.030 --> 22:46.942
Rats! Vegeta gets to go first, huh?

22:47.158 --> 22:49.023
I wanted to hurry up and fight, too!

22:49.243 --> 22:53.407
You people are taking Babidi
too lightly! Be more heedful!

22:53.622 --> 22:55.362
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:55.583 --> 23:00.828
"Don't Sell Super Saiyans Short!
Vegeta and Goku's Full-Bore Power!"

23:01.047 --> 23:04.960
Vegeta-san and Father really do
have out-of-this-world strength!

23:05.305 --> 23:11.884
