WEBVTT

00:52.385 --> 00:54.846
I'm Buck Strickland,
and if you don't recognize me

00:54.971 --> 00:56.681
- you're at the wrong event.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.641
Now, the assistant managers

00:58.725 --> 01:01.269
of the five Strickland propane
branches and I,

01:01.269 --> 01:04.481
welcome you all
to our annual winter picnic.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.984
We have gathered here
to celebrate propane...

01:08.651 --> 01:09.778
God's gas.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.238
And who could ignite
the celebration better

01:12.322 --> 01:15.200
than our senior assistant
manager Mr. Hank Hill?

01:15.617 --> 01:17.035
Hank, could you do the honors?

01:17.035 --> 01:18.078
I'd be honored.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.083
Well, hurry up, Hank.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.918
Turn winter into summer.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.599
Huh. Wow, Mr. Strickland,
it's like you always find

01:39.599 --> 01:42.102
the exact right moment
to flip those burgers.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.105
And I think you'll also find
that now is the exact right moment

01:45.230 --> 01:47.440
for my total quality management proposal.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.983
Oh, for god's sake.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.820
Hey, Vickers, who do you like
for the Superbowl next year?

01:51.820 --> 01:54.572
The dupey-loopies or the shimmy-shammies?

01:57.075 --> 01:59.577
Okay, okay... very funny.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.037
But I like the bills.

02:07.961 --> 02:08.795
Ooh!

02:09.587 --> 02:11.256
Look, mom... ash.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.883
- There must be a volcano somewhere.
- Huh?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.971
- It's... it's... it's snowing.
- Oh, no.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.306
- This can't be.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.892
Okay, I have been through
this before in Montana.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.270
Now, nobody lick any flagpoles.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.689
Snow!

02:28.439 --> 02:30.567
Texans aren't prepared for
this kind of nightmare, sir.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.026
We got to work fast.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.280
I'll unlock the gas reserves
while you rally the troops.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.906
All right, choke it down people.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.534
This is a propane emergency,
no time for chewing!

02:39.659 --> 02:41.494
If we don't get heat to the people

02:41.578 --> 02:43.538
you can bet the electric company will.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.716
Joe Jack, fire up the bobtail truck.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.843
- Don't be a hero, Hank.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.052
It's too late.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.432
- Can I come, too, dad?
- You bet, son.

03:02.432 --> 03:06.269
If you can catch a bobtail on the fly
you're welcome at Strickland propane.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.270
Come on.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.232
Slow down, Joe Jack.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.652
Slow way down.

03:14.861 --> 03:15.945
Slower.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.072
Just stop the truck.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.872
Whee!

03:26.122 --> 03:28.374
- It's a winter wonderland!

03:29.292 --> 03:30.585
Whee!

03:30.919 --> 03:33.213
I tell you what, man.
Go down to Antarctica.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.050
Ain't going to get that damn thing to work
with a big old bottom like he got.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.677
Whee!

03:39.761 --> 03:42.263
- No, ma'am, propane will not freeze.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.932
- Good news, Buck.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.434
We can get propane to the nursing homes

03:46.434 --> 03:49.896
by diverting it away from
the museum of modern art.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.732
If anyone asks, it was a tough choice.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.237
Uh-huh. That's why your dad's
one of the greats.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.197
Just watch and learn, son.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.908
Maybe someday,
you'll be sitting in that seat.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.701
Then where would he sit?

04:03.910 --> 04:06.454
The way things are going,
he'll be in the boss's chair.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.830
Oh, oh, no, sir.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.707
I'll just keep the chair I have

04:09.791 --> 04:12.252
and wheel it over to your desk
when the time comes.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.920
Whew! I'm beat.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.672
Think I'm going to call it a day.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.548
Just got to finish up my paperwork.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.592
There. Finished.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.889
Hey, dad, how come
I never got a Strickland calendar?

04:25.056 --> 04:27.558
Uh, that's not for you, Bobby.

04:27.850 --> 04:28.977
You're not old enough.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.646
- Well, hello, Miss. November.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.940
You be careful. That's flammable.

04:35.483 --> 04:40.113
Uh, Bobby, why don't you go on
outside and make snow angels?

04:40.655 --> 04:41.739
Okay.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.784
Whoo! Hey... speaking of angels.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.119
Look at the... Look at the wings

04:46.119 --> 04:48.621
on this piece of chicken,
would you? Would you?

04:49.539 --> 04:52.250
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Well, she certainly is attractive, sir.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.294
But I'm not sure that's an appropriate way

04:54.294 --> 04:56.379
to be talking about our cleaning lady.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.469
Merry Christmas.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.597
I see your stockings
are sure hung with care.

05:06.764 --> 05:07.765
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

05:07.974 --> 05:08.975
Ooh! Oh!

05:08.975 --> 05:10.226
Uh, uh, Buck?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.437
Got-dang it! I'm having an infarction.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.730
- What?
- Geez!

05:13.730 --> 05:15.815
No! Oh, my god.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.233
I'll call an ambulance!

05:18.568 --> 05:20.069
Must get to the hospital.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.195
Hang on, Buck.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.531
We've still got a lot of propane
to sell together.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.783
Hello. Emergency room, please.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.370
Dang it! Oh!

05:32.749 --> 05:36.794
Mr. Strickland, you got
to use both arms, like me.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.678
- <i>What do you think?</i>

05:45.762 --> 05:47.055
If I show up at the hospital

05:47.055 --> 05:49.265
with a tie on, it's kind of ghoulish.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.143
It's like saying, why aren't you dead yet?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.520
On the other hand, we are in a crisis

05:54.604 --> 05:56.856
and I will have to give orders.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.567
See? You are already thinking
like a man in charge.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.362
Ooh, this is so exciting.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.822
Save the tie for the funeral.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.162
All right...

06:11.579 --> 06:12.663
Everybody listen up.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.665
Strickland is a family.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.960
And I'm like the daddy,
and the daddy ain't feeling so good.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.421
So it's up to you kids to become leaders.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.174
Make sure daddy's business
don't get run into the ground.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.550
You work for me?

06:24.717 --> 06:26.177
Yes, sir, Mr. Strickland.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.678
I'm your daddy.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.098
Now, all five of you kids
are going to have to pitch in.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.350
Take, uh, take on
some added responsibility.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.770
Could you ladies step outside
for a minute, please?

06:35.770 --> 06:38.606
I-I got a shot coming,
and it's just rude, you know,

06:38.940 --> 06:41.692
to make two such pretty gals
stare at my bare backside.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.823
All right, now that the skirts
are out in the hallway,

06:46.823 --> 06:48.116
we can get down to business.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.243
One of you has to run the company.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.787
Hank, you're my right-hand man.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.289
I need you to feed my hounds.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.291
- Uh...
- Promise me you'll take care

06:57.375 --> 06:58.709
of my hounds, Hank.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.003
Uh, I'll take care of them. Sure.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.048
Tell me that you will love them, Hank.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.259
I'll, l... Uh, I'll... Uh...

07:06.259 --> 07:08.094
All right, I'll do so.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.639
Vickers, you run the company,
whole shebang.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.100
Let's see what that fancy business
degree of yours is worth.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.143
You betcha.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.894
You're putting him in charge?

07:16.978 --> 07:20.148
M-Mr. Strickland, I've been with
the company 15 years.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.191
Hank, I let you light the grill.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.277
Right now, my hounds are starving.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.290
I bought enough canned food
to last us through this storm.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.959
And the civil unrest
that will inevitably follow.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.336
Hope you like water chestnuts.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.301
Uh, hey, neighbor.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.552
I brought you something.

07:49.969 --> 07:50.928
Water chestnuts.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.847
Oh. Thank you.

07:53.055 --> 07:56.392
As a matter of fact, there is
something you can give me in return.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.353
I only have a three-week
supply of propane.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.439
But you'll get Hank to hook me up.

08:01.856 --> 08:02.940
You owe me.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.233
Well, I'm sorry, Dale.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.943
Hank may be in charge now,

08:06.027 --> 08:08.571
but you are not going to get
any special treatment.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.531
Hank's priorities are propane first,

08:10.698 --> 08:13.784
family second, friends third,
in that order.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.579
Fine. I'll just have to barter for it.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.040
Whee!

08:19.832 --> 08:20.791
Bill!

08:20.917 --> 08:22.710
You like pumpkin-pie filling?

08:39.727 --> 08:40.978
Hank!

08:46.234 --> 08:47.568
What's going on, Hank?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.073
Strickland picked Lloyd Vickers
as Interim Manager.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.407
What? Llo... Wha...

08:53.491 --> 08:55.952
That suck up's not even fit
to feed Strickland's dogs.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.454
Uh... actually...

08:58.746 --> 09:00.414
that's my department now.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.961
Oh. Well, I'm sure it has
its own set of challenges.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.050
Does anyone know what this means?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.885
You're going to be doing drug testing?

09:13.177 --> 09:14.637
You're thinking of PCP

09:14.762 --> 09:15.721
and, yes, we are.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.391
PDP, peak demand pricing.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.060
This weather has created
a propane shortage.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.313
Therefore, market forces dictate
that we raise our prices.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.858
In business school,
that's called supply and demand.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.527
HANk: Yeah, well, In the real world,

09:29.527 --> 09:32.113
that's called sticking it to people
when they need us most.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.324
Ah. Hank, can we dialogue for a second?

09:35.866 --> 09:37.410
I know this must be difficult for you.

09:37.868 --> 09:41.330
So I'm working out some flex time so you
can feed Mr. Strickland's dogs.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.707
And clean their mess.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.375
Look, let me tell you something.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.335
You can only learn from experience.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.713
You got to treat people with respect.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.339
You know who taught me that?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.340
Buck Strickland.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.558
He has the nerve to give me flex time.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.686
That's what they give pregnant women
and other disabled.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.023
I don't know, Hank. Sounds like he's
just trying to empower you.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.234
See, that's the fifth building block
of total quality management.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.277
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm. Yep.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.739
Well, you won't be so quick
to defend this guy when he raises

10:14.739 --> 10:16.866
propane prices, ten cents a gallon.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.952
- Ten cents? What are you talking about?
- What about my dang old hot tub, man?

10:20.036 --> 10:21.162
That's insane.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.246
Well, I'll tell you what.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.457
When Strickland gets back
from the hospital

10:24.457 --> 10:25.708
and finds out about this.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.918
He's going to have another heart attack.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.421
Someone's got to teach
that Vickers a lesson.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.299
If you want, I can show you
how to make a bomb

10:33.299 --> 10:36.719
out of a roll of toilet paper
and a stick of dynamite.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.766
Why didn't Buck Strickland
pick you to be boss, dad?

10:41.932 --> 10:45.519
Well, uh... sometimes in life, uh...

10:46.771 --> 10:49.607
Uh, curveball and such, uh...

10:51.150 --> 10:52.068
Uh...

10:52.401 --> 10:54.195
Ah, that's your ride, boy.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.200
Hey, Joe Jack, can you give
my boy a lift home?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.201
Sorry, Hank.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.079
Damn Vickers put tattlers
in the trucks now.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.747
What? He can't do that.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.248
What's a tattler?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.125
It's a meter that tells a boss

11:08.209 --> 11:10.753
when the driver stops and for how long.

11:11.045 --> 11:15.132
It's designed to prevent goof-offs,
lunch breaks, unscheduled stops.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.719
All the things the driver's union
fought so hard for.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.432
Meow. Look at me. I'm a kitty.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.185
- Meow. Meow, meow.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.853
Look, doggies. Look at me, I'm a kitty.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.272
- Meow!

11:33.484 --> 11:36.654
Good girl. Look at me.
I've got whiskers. I'm a kitty cat.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.614
Run, honey! They've seen you!

11:46.956 --> 11:48.290
This is ridiculous.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.584
There's a snow crisis going on.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.671
And I'm sitting here,
scrubbing off dog slobber.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.381
Do not blame yourself.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.925
Strickland is the fool
who passed you over.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.636
Well, no one bats a thousand.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.221
Strickland's a good man.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.140
He's the only other guy at the firm

12:04.140 --> 12:06.934
who has the same passion
for propane that I do.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.937
Oh... my... Lord.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.439
What?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.023
The stove!

12:13.107 --> 12:14.984
It's not propane! It's electric.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.402
- No!
- Yes!

12:17.236 --> 12:21.449
Well, it better be self-cleaning
because I think I'm going to vomit.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.078
How could you, sir?

12:26.203 --> 12:28.205
How could you buy an electric stove

12:28.289 --> 12:30.708
after everything propane has given you?

12:30.833 --> 12:33.669
Dang it, Hank,
we're both men of the world.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.464
I got a whole bunch
of electric appliances.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.882
They came with the house.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.050
But, Mr. Strickland, you've always said

12:40.134 --> 12:42.511
that propane is God's gas.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.138
It's a higher calling.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.265
Aw, heck, Hank, it's just a business.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.810
It's about making as much money
as you can, while you can.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.229
That's why I let Vickers
put in them tattlers.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.565
What? You knew about that?

12:54.690 --> 12:57.943
Oh, sure. I've been using tattlers
off and on for years.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.280
Back in the old days, we used midgets.
Stuck them behind the seats

13:01.280 --> 13:03.407
with a bucket of ice to keep them cool.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.492
That's till Osha came in.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.452
And put them poor little people
on the street.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.996
That's what they like to be
called, Hank. Little people.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.540
The 15 years I've worked with you

13:11.749 --> 13:13.918
have been the happiest years of my life.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.962
Now I find out it was all a lie.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.341
I never thought I would say this but...

13:21.467 --> 13:24.386
Mr. Strickland, I'm not
coming in to work tomorrow.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.807
You mean you quit or are you taking
a personal day?

13:28.891 --> 13:29.767
You heard me!

13:37.066 --> 13:40.027
I just need a couple days
up at the lake to figure out

13:40.027 --> 13:42.112
what I was meant to do in this life.

13:42.446 --> 13:43.781
I've been taking a good hard look

13:43.781 --> 13:45.282
at the propane business

13:45.366 --> 13:48.828
and it's sort of like seeing a woman
with her makeup off.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.914
Sharona Johnson
came to beauty school once,

13:51.914 --> 13:54.166
with her makeup off, and nobody told her.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.461
Mm... that was mean.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.129
Dad.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.339
I got the stove.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.175
Where's the propane thingy
that goes into it?

14:04.343 --> 14:05.469
Put it back, son.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.389
There's no room for propane on this trip.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.811
Now listen to me, Joe Jack.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.938
We're just two steps from win-win.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.191
Step one, you put the tattler boxes
back in the trucks.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.652
Step two, you keep your jobs.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.779
Oh, I got a third step for you, honey.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.197
- We quit.
- Yeah.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.491
Fine! Quit!

14:27.575 --> 14:31.161
I've got a whole alumni newsletter
full of friends I can call on.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.664
They'll drive those trucks
just for the life experience.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.127
And I guess your friends
are Haz-mat certified, too.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.129
Haz-mat?

14:40.129 --> 14:42.798
MR. STRICKLAND (yelling):
Hazardous materials, Vickers!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.008
You moron!

14:44.008 --> 14:47.011
You need a special license
to drive a propane truck!

14:47.261 --> 14:49.013
It's all right, sir, I can get to yes.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.223
I'll hire a new batch
of drivers right away.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.392
You listen to me, got-dang it.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.145
It's the got-dang height of the season.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.773
There's no drivers from here
to got-dang city!

15:00.441 --> 15:01.984
You're fired!

15:03.027 --> 15:04.320
Here you go, sister.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.872
I told you we should have
stopped at the Mega Lo Mart.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.666
They don't even have a separate
candy department here.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.377
Bobby Hill, we are at a remote
cabin out in the wilderness.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.962
We will make our own candy.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.680
Hank, what are you doing?

15:31.972 --> 15:32.973
Put it down.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.224
Now someone might see you.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.309
Come on, Peggy.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.102
Haven't you ever wondered what it's like,

15:37.186 --> 15:38.646
to barbecue with charcoal?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.606
You mean without propane?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.608
But, I don't think that.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.194
Well... well, yeah.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.654
I guess I am curious.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.656
This is the Hill residence.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.282
Please leave a message at the beep.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.953
MR. STRICKLAND (on phone): <i>Hank,
it's your old buddy Buck Strickland.</i>

15:53.953 --> 15:55.788
<i>That Vickers mucked things up worse</i>

15:56.121 --> 15:58.457
<i>than Jack Kennedy at piggy bay,
so I got no drivers!</i>

15:58.707 --> 16:01.210
<i>I got no right-hand man!
I need you, ol' top!</i>

16:01.585 --> 16:03.045
<i>I need you bad.</i>

16:09.426 --> 16:11.303
Comes to 21.24.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.474
Aw, darn. I only got a twenty.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.976
I'll just run out to the car.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.560
Aw, twenty's close enough.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.396
We don't care about a buck here or there.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.606
People before pennies, I always say.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.900
Hmm. Well, thank you, friend.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.402
You're good people.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.822
We don't care about a buck here or there.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.366
Now I know why they call you pa.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.076
'Cause you're pa-thetic.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.120
And I know why they call you ma.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.539
'Cause you're always riding ma ass!

16:39.999 --> 16:42.710
<i>Hank, it's Rudy over
at Goobersmooches restaurant.</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
<i>I got no propane for my stoves.</i>

16:45.004 --> 16:47.423
<i>I'm looking at 20 pounds
of rotten rib eye.</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:08.193
I saved your life, dad.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.611
Huh?

17:09.695 --> 17:10.821
I saved your life.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.614
I was going to push you in

17:12.698 --> 17:13.991
and then I saved your life.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.784
You were going to push me in?

17:16.201 --> 17:17.369
It was a joke.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.831
Ah!

17:20.831 --> 17:23.000
I said do not disturb him.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.960
- Ohhh.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.725
<i>We don't care about
a buck here or there.</i>

17:40.392 --> 17:42.519
<i>people before pennies.</i>

17:43.270 --> 17:44.313
People...

17:44.313 --> 17:45.689
Of course, people.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.150
Peggy! Peggy!

17:48.317 --> 17:49.359
What? What is it?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.653
Pack up the car! I figured it all out!

17:51.820 --> 17:54.865
It's not about tattler boxes
or who's in charge.

17:55.115 --> 17:58.243
It's about service with a smile
and making people happy.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.369
Oh, I knew it!

17:59.453 --> 18:00.871
You are going back to Strickland.

18:00.871 --> 18:01.955
Hell, no.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.832
I'm going to open up a general store.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.375
Escucha me?

18:05.584 --> 18:09.046
You see, everything I thought I'd
find in propane it isn't there.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.048
It's in the general store.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.800
Where they put people before pennies.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.511
A fella's got no money,
he can't pay his bill?

18:15.719 --> 18:17.054
Well, that's good enough for us.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.181
And then that fella
will tell another fella

18:19.181 --> 18:20.182
and before you know it,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.434
I'll have customers
lined up around the block.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.354
- Bobby? Bobby, get out here, boy!

18:25.354 --> 18:27.189
I'm leaving the propane business

18:27.189 --> 18:29.525
and opening up a general store.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.610
Okay.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.862
I can't do it alone, Peggy.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.323
General stores are Ma and Pa.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.699
If you're not there

18:37.783 --> 18:39.576
people are going to make assumptions like,

18:39.660 --> 18:41.328
did Pa kill Ma?

18:41.578 --> 18:43.580
They aren't going to want to buy
batteries from me

18:43.664 --> 18:45.374
if they think you're back in the freezer

18:45.374 --> 18:48.335
hanging from a meat hook. Am I wrong?

18:48.544 --> 18:49.920
I don't know. I don't know.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.171
People do need batteries.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.257
But this is just all happening so fast.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.343
Will you think about it... Ma?

18:59.930 --> 19:02.099
We could have a section
for children's books.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.644
And we wouldn't even have to talk to them
as long as the kids brought them back.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.646
That's a great idea, Peggy.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.106
Kids are people.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.232
You see, you've come up

19:10.232 --> 19:12.609
with a whole new customer base
for our store.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.278
Ohh, well...

19:14.570 --> 19:15.863
Oh, what the H?

19:15.863 --> 19:17.322
You know what? I'll do it.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.868
I am going to go type
my letter of resignation,

19:20.993 --> 19:22.703
to the Arlen school board right now.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.039
I guess I'd better write my letter, too.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.963
It is with regret...

19:37.259 --> 19:39.303
<i>Hank,
it's Velma Throckmorton.</i>

19:39.469 --> 19:41.013
<i>My hands froze to my walker</i>

19:41.013 --> 19:42.806
<i>and I had to thaw them in the microwave.</i>

19:42.890 --> 19:44.141
<i>I need my propane.</i>

19:45.142 --> 19:48.437
It is with... deep regret...

19:50.439 --> 19:52.524
<i>Uh, Mr. Hill,
it's Hugh Jimmerson.</i>

19:52.649 --> 19:53.692
<i>My heat's gone out.</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:56.612
<i>I've tried wearing turtlenecks,
but they make me look French.</i>

19:57.070 --> 19:58.488
<i>Where are your trucks?</i>

19:58.906 --> 20:02.910
It is with very deep regret...

20:04.912 --> 20:07.331
<i>Mr. Hill, it's Leta Anderson.</i>

20:07.581 --> 20:09.333
<i>All three kids got the group</i>

20:09.458 --> 20:11.126
<i>and I'm clear out of propane.</i>

20:11.418 --> 20:13.670
<i>It's cold. It's real cold.</i>

20:17.466 --> 20:18.634
All finished, Hank!

20:19.718 --> 20:21.345
Okay. Here it is.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.389
One resignation letter,
signed and self-notarized.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.600
Hank?

20:28.810 --> 20:32.981
<i>Peggy, went back to work.
Love, Hank Hill</i>

20:38.987 --> 20:40.656
Oh, is that you, Hank?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.783
You come back to dance on my grave?

20:43.367 --> 20:45.744
No, sir. I don't feel much like dancing.

20:45.744 --> 20:49.206
There's a town in crisis out there
and they need propane.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.209
It ain't going to happen, Hank.
Vickers screwed everything up.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.211
All our drivers quit.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.673
A real propane man
doesn't know the word quit.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.841
Well, I don't know how they said it,

21:00.342 --> 21:02.803
but them drivers
ain't working here no more!

21:03.053 --> 21:05.597
And you and me can't
drive them propane trucks

21:05.681 --> 21:08.016
because we don't have Haz-mat licenses.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.851
It's all over.

21:09.977 --> 21:10.936
No, it ain't.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.697
You don't need any Haz-mat license

21:21.697 --> 21:23.031
to drive a tow truck.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.668
Hooray! Hooray!

21:34.793 --> 21:38.880
Yeah!

21:41.341 --> 21:42.968
Saved your life, dad.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.263
Saved my life.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.307
Now I get it.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.766
Aaah.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.764
<i>Look at me, I'm a kitty. Reow!</i>
