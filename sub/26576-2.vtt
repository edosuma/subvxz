WEBVTT

00:01.883 --> 00:03.580
- What happened?
- We, uh...

00:03.586 --> 00:04.996
- Slept together.
- Who'd you have sex with?

00:05.002 --> 00:06.994
- Frank.
- Yeah, AKA Sugar Beard.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.080
Are the three of you aware
that Martin and I broke up?

00:09.086 --> 00:11.508
Lisa Apple, are you pregnant or not?

00:11.721 --> 00:14.520
I think we may have to ruin
Martin and Lena's weekend.

00:23.812 --> 00:25.044
Hey, Lena.

00:27.015 --> 00:28.251
Lena!

00:28.257 --> 00:29.849
Can we please talk?

00:29.855 --> 00:32.426
Sorry! I can't hear you!

00:32.753 --> 00:36.881
Okay, well, how am I able to
hear you if you can't hear me?

00:41.101 --> 00:43.796
Hey, look, I know you
don't want to get into it,

00:44.212 --> 00:46.087
but I think it would
healthy for us to have...

00:46.093 --> 00:47.416
A baby?

00:47.670 --> 00:52.548
Really, Martin? A baby with Lisa Apple?

00:52.662 --> 00:55.750
And what would that even
mean to the kids, to us?

00:55.756 --> 00:58.592
- How do we explain that to people?
- I-I don't know.

00:58.598 --> 01:02.314
- I don't know, but I-I do know...
- This is the ultimate sign,

01:02.320 --> 01:05.117
the ultimate, giant
billboard of a sign...

01:05.123 --> 01:09.003
- "It's over!" "Move on!"
- I disagree. I don't want to.

01:09.368 --> 01:14.346
And, by the way, who accidentally
gets someone pregnant at your age?

01:14.352 --> 01:16.150
- Did you forget how sex worked?
- Come on.

01:16.156 --> 01:19.376
- Did you not use birth control?
- We used birth control, okay? It's just...

01:19.382 --> 01:20.582
It's just...

01:20.588 --> 01:23.375
My guys are very dogged. You know that.

01:25.206 --> 01:27.636
- Milo.
- Are you seriously

01:27.642 --> 01:30.129
giving your sperm a
shout-out right now?

01:30.135 --> 01:31.335
I'm not giving them a shout-out.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.828
- It's more like credit where credit is...
- "Dogged"?

01:33.834 --> 01:37.338
You know what? They're
reckless. Every last one of 'em.

01:37.344 --> 01:38.849
That's their job, Lena.

01:40.528 --> 01:41.728
Look.

01:43.428 --> 01:46.652
We don't actually know if
Lisa is pregnant, right?

01:46.658 --> 01:49.438
Yes. Technically, we
don't know for sure.

01:49.444 --> 01:51.856
So, before we go making
any rash decisions

01:51.862 --> 01:54.863
or saying things about each other's
sperms that we can't take back,

01:54.869 --> 01:57.264
can we at least find out if it's true?

01:57.270 --> 01:58.825
- "We"?
- Me.

01:59.175 --> 02:01.866
I promise to get to the
bottom of this, okay?

02:02.466 --> 02:04.055
But you...

02:05.048 --> 02:07.139
Just don't skip ahead to the ending.

02:07.873 --> 02:09.979
Don't skip ahead to us ending.

02:09.985 --> 02:12.101
So, what, I'm supposed to just

02:12.107 --> 02:14.194
- sit around here and...
- Wait.

02:15.143 --> 02:16.605
Just wait.

02:16.726 --> 02:18.225
You know, I know you're
not big on waiting.

02:18.231 --> 02:20.123
I know you like to rally the troops

02:20.129 --> 02:22.036
and march them down the field, but...

02:22.442 --> 02:23.950
just this once...

02:25.156 --> 02:28.367
will you wait up for me?

02:32.648 --> 02:34.548
Go talk to Lisa Apple.

03:00.468 --> 03:01.900
You know who else was trying?

03:01.906 --> 03:03.478
Toby last year.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.360
But that didn't get him
out of the second grade.

03:05.366 --> 03:06.973
Harsh, but fair.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.471
See? That's what I'm
trying to be... fair.

03:09.477 --> 03:12.260
Even though every fiber of
my being is telling me to run,

03:12.266 --> 03:13.573
I am not doing that.

03:13.579 --> 03:15.768
Why? Because that's what love is...

03:15.774 --> 03:17.299
ignoring your own instincts

03:17.305 --> 03:19.441
and putting someone else's needs first.

03:19.447 --> 03:21.113
That's what love is?

03:21.119 --> 03:23.542
Well, it's open for debate,
but, yes, that's what it is.

03:24.118 --> 03:25.323
Pbht!

03:25.642 --> 03:27.826
Mason, hey! What are you doing here?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.443
I thought you hated crafty stuff.

03:29.449 --> 03:32.226
I do, but Hazel's camp friends
wanted to try, so we're all here.

03:32.232 --> 03:34.032
- Well, tight.
- Mom.

03:34.239 --> 03:37.650
And, Hazel, I love this new look.

03:37.656 --> 03:39.154
So much going on.

03:39.160 --> 03:42.256
It's about gloves. Okay,
darling? It's about gloves.

03:42.262 --> 03:43.954
- Okay, well...
- Listen.

03:44.038 --> 03:46.352
- No, I am.
- We all are.

03:46.552 --> 03:48.873
It's... it's very intriguing.

03:51.555 --> 03:53.881
Here... I'll set you
kids up at this table.

03:53.887 --> 03:55.884
And, Toby, we'll continue
our conversation...

03:55.890 --> 03:57.673
on love and sacrifice when I return.

03:57.679 --> 03:59.045
I need more brown.

03:59.051 --> 04:00.275
You got it.

04:00.581 --> 04:03.376
Ah-ha! So you're a Taurus.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.852
- I guess.
- Ah, spoken like a true Taurus.

04:07.871 --> 04:09.791
And so, what are you?

04:09.975 --> 04:11.299
I'll give you a hint.

04:11.305 --> 04:13.689
My ruler is Mars. I'm
a natural-born leader.

04:13.695 --> 04:15.275
My element is fire.

04:15.281 --> 04:16.774
I really don't follow...

04:16.779 --> 04:20.459
Okay, I also share a star
sign with Mariah Carey,

04:20.464 --> 04:23.280
Chance, the Rapper, and Scott Eastwood.

04:24.073 --> 04:25.698
I basically just gave it away.

04:26.413 --> 04:30.718
- I'm an Aries, girl!
- Oh, an Aries! Right!

04:30.724 --> 04:33.446
- Like Scott Eastwood.
- Hell, yeah!

04:34.312 --> 04:35.538
Oh, man, I am...

04:35.544 --> 04:37.649
so stoked on you being a Taurus.

04:37.655 --> 04:39.231
It's like I hit the jackpot.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.448
You're honest, loyal.

05:05.738 --> 05:06.938
Come on in.

05:08.337 --> 05:10.263
- Hey, man. I-I'm Martin.
- I'm Valee.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.231
Uh, sorry to interrupt, um,

05:12.237 --> 05:14.545
but I-I need your help with that...

05:15.542 --> 05:18.631
that new band, The Lisa Apple Situation.

05:18.637 --> 05:20.537
Lisa Apple's not really a band.

05:20.543 --> 05:22.943
It's his ex-girlfriend
who might be knocked up.

05:22.949 --> 05:24.842
- Womp, womp, womp-womp.
- Dude!

05:24.848 --> 05:26.576
I'm just trying to be
transparent with my client.

05:26.582 --> 05:28.467
Who knocks somebody up at your age?

05:28.473 --> 05:29.972
My guys are very dogged.

05:29.978 --> 05:31.410
Not me.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.214
Super low sperm count.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.186
So, we're just telling
Valee everything about our...

05:35.402 --> 05:37.815
- our lives? Okay.
- Yeah.

05:37.821 --> 05:41.605
Well, Lisa Apple is not my only problem.

05:41.611 --> 05:43.697
Okay, I'm still trying to
patch things up with my ex-wife,

05:43.703 --> 05:46.314
- Lena, but she's...
- Got you on hold till she figures out

05:46.320 --> 05:49.118
what's happening with
the, uh, Apple Situation.

05:49.124 --> 05:50.603
Hundo-P!

05:50.609 --> 05:52.212
- Don't say that.
- Okay.

05:52.218 --> 05:55.970
Look, I know I need to talk to
her, and I'm gonna. I am on it...

05:55.976 --> 05:57.679
but I'm just kind of
dreading it, you know?

05:57.685 --> 05:59.672
I mean, whether she is
or... or isn't pregnant,

05:59.678 --> 06:01.476
I know she's not gonna
be happy to see me.

06:02.688 --> 06:03.888
Yo. Hey!

06:03.894 --> 06:06.061
Hey, I am baring my
soul to you right now

06:06.067 --> 06:07.364
and you're on your phone?

06:07.445 --> 06:10.747
Valee is listening, and
we're not even friends.

06:10.753 --> 06:12.041
I feel like we're friends.

06:12.047 --> 06:14.247
- Uh, yeah...
- I am listening.

06:14.253 --> 06:17.237
I'm just searching Lisa
Apple's 'gram for Intel.

06:18.456 --> 06:19.875
She just posted.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.244
"A lot on my mind."

06:25.250 --> 06:27.557
- She's pregnant.
- Definitely pregnant.

06:31.238 --> 06:32.438
You know what we should do next?

06:32.652 --> 06:34.060
We should all paint a teapot together.

06:34.066 --> 06:36.551
Then we'd have, like,
a friendship tea set.

06:37.050 --> 06:38.547
We're totally doing that.

06:38.636 --> 06:40.500
- Bible.
- Bible!

06:40.506 --> 06:41.706
Bible!

06:42.102 --> 06:43.302
Right.

06:48.696 --> 06:50.516
What the hell?

06:51.344 --> 06:53.183
Honey, what's going on?

06:53.672 --> 06:56.750
- What do you mean?
- You're acting like some kind of a lap dog.

06:56.756 --> 07:00.080
- And also, friendship tea set?
- It's fine.

07:00.168 --> 07:02.418
I haven't seen Hazel all summer, and...

07:02.424 --> 07:04.736
I missed her, and I'm just
trying to rekindle things.

07:09.844 --> 07:11.862
- Are you wearing makeup?
- Mm, no.

07:11.868 --> 07:15.474
Okay, well, this morning, your
complexion was "Apricot Ice,"

07:15.480 --> 07:18.249
and now it's practically "Summer Peach."

07:18.255 --> 07:19.740
It's tinted sunscreen.

07:19.746 --> 07:22.160
Look, Hazel went to André Leon Talley's

07:22.166 --> 07:23.552
- Fashion Camp, okay?
- Okay.

07:23.558 --> 07:26.087
And those kids are her gay bunkmates,

07:26.093 --> 07:28.474
who, as you can see, are flawless.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.765
Hazel, also flawless.

07:31.092 --> 07:33.771
Me... not so flawless.

07:33.777 --> 07:35.029
What? That's not true.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.343
Mom, stop. I look like an old sheep dog.

07:37.349 --> 07:38.841
More green, darling.

07:39.173 --> 07:40.453
On it, darling!

07:40.859 --> 07:43.375
Okay, I am not comfortable
with you changing

07:43.381 --> 07:45.262
who you are and
abandoning your interests

07:45.268 --> 07:46.757
for some glove-wearing...

07:46.763 --> 07:50.152
"That's what love is... putting
someone else's needs first."

07:50.158 --> 07:51.752
Exactly. Thank you.

07:55.466 --> 07:57.558
What's the ETA on brown?

08:02.450 --> 08:03.738
Welcome back.

08:03.824 --> 08:06.542
Will the silver fox
be joining you today?

08:06.548 --> 08:09.855
Oh! No, but thank you for asking.

08:09.861 --> 08:13.715
No, I'm... I'm dining alone.
I have so much on my mind.

08:13.721 --> 08:15.803
Oh, I just meant do you
need the second chair?

08:15.809 --> 08:18.411
No, but what do I need?

08:19.135 --> 08:20.805
So, I-I can take the chair?

08:20.811 --> 08:23.093
I don't know. I don't know anything.

08:23.099 --> 08:24.361
That's not fair. I did know.

08:24.367 --> 08:26.575
I knew my whole life that
I wanted to have a baby,

08:26.581 --> 08:27.981
and then I never met the right guy.

08:27.987 --> 08:29.878
So I got a donor, and now I'm pregnant.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.084
I'll get a different chair.

08:31.090 --> 08:33.455
And then I met the silver fox,

08:33.461 --> 08:35.227
whose real name is Sugar Beard,

08:35.234 --> 08:37.099
- aka Country Music Face.
- Mm-hm.

08:37.105 --> 08:39.886
- And you saw him. He's so handsome.
- I did.

08:39.893 --> 08:41.711
And he's really into me.

08:41.717 --> 08:44.107
- And he values honesty.
- Mm-hm.

08:45.777 --> 08:47.906
I have to tell him, don't I?

08:47.912 --> 08:50.038
I-I mean, I don't want to, but should I?

08:50.044 --> 08:52.344
I-I'm just... I'm afraid
that I'm gonna scare him off!

08:52.358 --> 08:54.659
Based on this interaction,
I'm thinking you will.

08:54.958 --> 08:57.553
Do you know how to act normal or...?

08:57.559 --> 08:59.177
What happened to the bread guy?

08:59.183 --> 09:00.454
- He seemed nicer.
- Look...

09:00.460 --> 09:01.932
why not just tell him what's going on

09:01.938 --> 09:03.565
and say that you're asking for a friend

09:03.571 --> 09:05.768
and that you want his thoughts
on what the friend should do?

09:05.883 --> 09:07.765
Are you kidding? That's your advice?

09:07.771 --> 09:10.054
Because anyone who's
attended middle school

09:10.060 --> 09:12.362
knows that when you say
you're "asking for a friend,"

09:12.368 --> 09:14.031
you're asking for yourself.

09:14.037 --> 09:15.935
Yeah, but that's only because
people don't put enough

09:15.941 --> 09:17.507
thought into a credible backstory.

09:17.513 --> 09:18.913
You really have to flesh out the friend

09:18.919 --> 09:20.128
if you want someone to buy it.

09:20.134 --> 09:22.631
- No. That's never worked.
- Wrong.

09:22.637 --> 09:24.344
This saved my friend Jonas' marriage.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.201
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah. I've known him since college.

09:26.207 --> 09:28.616
Good guy, lives in Encino,
married his high-school sweetheart,

09:28.622 --> 09:31.906
but two kids later, their
love life goes kaput.

09:31.912 --> 09:33.608
So, he asks "for a friend"

09:33.614 --> 09:35.506
if she thinks introducing a third party

09:35.512 --> 09:36.809
might spice things up.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.945
And what did the wife say?

09:38.951 --> 09:40.619
The wife doesn't exist.

09:40.625 --> 09:42.256
Neither does Jonas. That's my point.

09:42.262 --> 09:43.836
Work on your backstory.

09:47.376 --> 09:49.610
Mae Day, what's all this?

09:49.704 --> 09:51.377
Presentation for Bio.

09:51.963 --> 09:53.309
Oh, word?

09:54.004 --> 09:55.470
Talk me in.

09:56.677 --> 09:58.077
Tell me all the deets,

09:58.083 --> 10:00.997
or as a scientist
would say, the details.

10:01.688 --> 10:02.985
It's about how baby boomers

10:02.991 --> 10:04.698
ruined the planet for future generations

10:04.704 --> 10:06.699
by ignoring the clear
signs of global warming.

10:06.705 --> 10:07.924
Ah-ha!

10:08.222 --> 10:09.722
They totally did.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.826
I created a CGI animation

10:13.832 --> 10:16.249
showing the decades of
changing weather patterns.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.234
Wow.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.263
So you just banged this
whole thing out, huh?

10:20.269 --> 10:21.825
You're really on it.

10:21.831 --> 10:24.337
You know, sometimes, I-I
say that I'm on it, but...

10:24.343 --> 10:26.124
honestly, I'm nowhere near it.

10:26.130 --> 10:28.438
- Okay?
- And I'm sure you're not dying to do it.

10:28.444 --> 10:30.538
- I actually really need to...
- You just rolled up your sleeves

10:30.544 --> 10:34.042
and handled your business
like a grown-ass man.

10:34.048 --> 10:35.961
I don't think we have
to assign a gender to it,

10:35.967 --> 10:37.738
but yes, I did.

10:37.744 --> 10:39.780
Procrastination is for losers.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.469
"Losers"?

10:41.754 --> 10:43.272
Losers.

10:43.278 --> 10:46.682
Cowards. Weaklings. Little babies.

10:46.688 --> 10:47.888
The elderly.

10:47.894 --> 10:51.399
If there's a task at hand,
just get to it. Right?

10:51.792 --> 10:52.992
Right.

10:55.679 --> 10:56.989
Okay.

10:57.267 --> 10:58.551
Thank you.

10:59.556 --> 11:00.876
Hey, Mason?!

11:00.882 --> 11:04.283
I found a blending egg in the bathroom

11:04.289 --> 11:06.170
- of the shop, and...
- Mine.

11:06.176 --> 11:07.649
Just leave it in my room, please.

11:07.655 --> 11:09.548
Oh. Okay, will do!

11:10.142 --> 11:12.149
But, Mason, I've been thinking.

11:12.155 --> 11:14.563
- I know you want to impress Hazel...
- Yep.

11:14.569 --> 11:17.125
and I just want to make sure

11:17.131 --> 11:19.224
you don't lose sight of
yourself in the process.

11:19.230 --> 11:20.430
I won't.

11:20.631 --> 11:22.934
Okay, 'cause it's just... it...

11:22.940 --> 11:24.335
You've been a little...

11:31.721 --> 11:33.016
Why?

11:33.410 --> 11:34.707
And how?

11:34.713 --> 11:36.019
But mostly why.

11:36.025 --> 11:37.504
Guilty of the "how,"

11:37.510 --> 11:40.316
but I'm pretty sure the
"why" speaks for itself.

11:40.322 --> 11:41.715
Don't you love?

11:41.721 --> 11:44.353
Um... well...

11:44.359 --> 11:45.559
I know. Me, too.

11:45.565 --> 11:47.541
I mean, no offense, but I kind of

11:47.547 --> 11:49.728
never really got Mason
before, but this...

11:49.734 --> 11:51.722
this is just mm, mm, mm, mm, mwah!

11:51.728 --> 11:53.834
Totally, but this is
all reversible, right?

11:53.947 --> 11:56.780
Whoa. You look beat to hell.

11:56.986 --> 12:00.010
That's kind of what
I was wanting to say.

12:00.979 --> 12:02.497
Mason, it's too much.

12:02.503 --> 12:04.791
Really? I think it's super subtle.

12:04.797 --> 12:08.269
He looks like a plastic
surgeon from the 1970s.

12:08.275 --> 12:09.947
As long as Hazel likes it, I don't care.

12:09.953 --> 12:11.844
See? That's fascinating to me, son.

12:11.850 --> 12:13.864
That's what I want to explore.

12:13.870 --> 12:16.258
It's clear you want Hazel to want you,

12:16.264 --> 12:19.946
but do you even want her if
it means keeping up all this?

12:19.952 --> 12:22.775
- Mom, yes. I'm in love with Hazel.
- He's deeply in love with her.

12:22.781 --> 12:23.981
Are you, though?

12:24.173 --> 12:29.486
Or are you in love with the idea
of her being in love with you?

12:29.492 --> 12:31.700
- No, I'm in actual deep love with her.
- I'm so confused right now.

12:31.706 --> 12:32.906
Shh, shh, shh.

12:32.996 --> 12:35.200
I think I'm figuring
something out about myself.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.685
- Ugh.
- I know.

12:41.691 --> 12:43.695
I know you don't want to see me.

12:43.802 --> 12:45.694
Trust me. I've stalled
as long as I could

12:45.700 --> 12:48.890
to avoid putting that
exact look on your face.

12:48.896 --> 12:51.019
Well, sorry about my face.

12:51.025 --> 12:52.322
- Bye.
- No, look.

12:52.328 --> 12:54.910
Lisa, I'm sure I'm the last
person you want to talk to.

12:54.916 --> 12:56.918
Actually, you were the first
person I wanted to talk to

12:56.924 --> 12:59.713
when I left your house that
night half-naked and crying.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.339
But I never heard from you.

13:01.345 --> 13:04.027
Right, so then I became the last person

13:04.033 --> 13:06.636
- like I was originally saying.
- Just...

13:06.642 --> 13:10.033
And, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look, forget it. Lisa.

13:10.465 --> 13:13.945
I heard something about
you, potentially about us.

13:14.839 --> 13:16.543
And if it's true,

13:17.035 --> 13:19.160
I-I want to be there to...

13:20.050 --> 13:21.637
see you through.

13:21.643 --> 13:23.666
See me through?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.370
Are you pregnant?

13:26.770 --> 13:28.270
I'm not doing this!

13:28.370 --> 13:30.396
You don't get to come here
and ask me your questions

13:30.402 --> 13:32.173
- when you haven't answered any of mine.
- Okay.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.354
No, I... Hey, I get that. That's fair.

13:34.768 --> 13:36.364
What are your questions?

13:38.759 --> 13:40.564
Did you sleep with your ex-wife?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.360
Wow, just... just s-starting off

13:42.366 --> 13:43.970
- with the big one, huh?
- Did you?

13:47.759 --> 13:49.166
I did, yeah.

13:50.128 --> 13:52.011
Well, that sucks.

13:54.443 --> 13:57.051
So, I was right about you
still having feelings for her.

13:57.623 --> 13:58.923
You were right.

14:01.012 --> 14:02.492
So you admit you lied?

14:02.498 --> 14:03.698
Lisa...

14:03.704 --> 14:04.904
Did you also lie about

14:04.910 --> 14:07.210
being able to do two-finger
pushups like Bruce Lee?

14:07.216 --> 14:09.374
No! I used to be able
to do those in college.

14:09.380 --> 14:12.048
I swear! This guy Dan has a tape.

14:15.442 --> 14:17.561
So, are you and Lena
getting back together?

14:18.152 --> 14:19.868
I guess it depends.

14:22.309 --> 14:25.113
- Can I ask you a question now?
- Negative.

14:25.403 --> 14:27.703
Test was negative, so
you're off the hook.

14:28.194 --> 14:29.725
So, you're not pregnant?

14:29.731 --> 14:32.604
Nope. So, there's no
reason for you to be here.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.137
I guess not.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.994
I have one more question.

14:41.823 --> 14:44.110
Do you think you could ever forgive me?

14:48.180 --> 14:49.395
Everything okay?

14:49.586 --> 14:50.990
Yeah, yeah.

14:51.192 --> 14:52.792
Talk to me, girl. What's wrong?

14:52.861 --> 14:55.367
Well... it's just...

14:56.956 --> 15:00.266
You know my friend Karen,
my best friend since I was 9?

15:00.272 --> 15:01.575
I think I've told you about her before.

15:01.581 --> 15:05.574
She's allergic to stone fruit,
and she was in the Air Force.

15:07.475 --> 15:09.778
- Capricorn?
- Oh, yeah.

15:09.854 --> 15:12.172
Yeah, I think I remember
Karen. Yeah. How is she doing?

15:12.178 --> 15:14.977
Not good. See, Karen always
wanted to have a baby,

15:14.983 --> 15:16.590
but she never met the right guy.

15:16.596 --> 15:19.047
- Not even in the Air Force?
- No.

15:19.354 --> 15:24.535
So, she decided to use a donor,
which I really admire. Don't you?

15:24.541 --> 15:27.350
Oh, yeah! Totally. I mean, she
took fate into her own hands.

15:27.356 --> 15:29.153
Yes, she did! Yes, that's right,

15:29.164 --> 15:30.447
and it's just so Karen

15:30.453 --> 15:32.261
- if you know her, and I do.
- Mm.

15:32.267 --> 15:33.638
Here's the rub...

15:33.644 --> 15:36.045
a week after she finds
out she's pregnant,

15:36.142 --> 15:39.034
she meets this really great guy.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.536
Ooh, plot twist.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.139
And now she's like, "Maya,

15:42.145 --> 15:44.124
my best friend since I was 9,

15:44.130 --> 15:46.250
do you think that I should tell him?

15:46.256 --> 15:48.759
Do you think that he's
gonna break up with me?"

15:48.917 --> 15:52.117
What do you think, you know,
just from a guy's perspective?

15:52.123 --> 15:53.323
Honestly?

15:53.691 --> 15:55.128
He's definitely gonna dump her.

15:55.311 --> 15:56.704
When Jasper was born,

15:56.710 --> 15:58.783
that little creature just took over...

15:58.789 --> 16:00.392
the bed, the boob. I...

16:00.398 --> 16:03.396
It was all diapers. No date nights.

16:03.498 --> 16:05.577
That's a lot to ask of the average guy,

16:05.750 --> 16:08.382
and add the fact that
it's not even his baby.

16:08.882 --> 16:10.381
Karen doesn't stand a chance.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.042
Mm. She's gonna need our support,

16:12.048 --> 16:13.481
so I definitely want to meet her.

16:13.487 --> 16:15.759
If not tonight, some other time.

16:16.028 --> 16:17.977
You want to meet Karen?

16:19.368 --> 16:22.411
He's been like this
for hours, and watch.

16:22.417 --> 16:26.182
Mason? Can I put another
puppy sticker on your face?

16:26.269 --> 16:28.587
If it's okay, just say nothing.

16:33.163 --> 16:35.293
What's wrong with you? Stop doing that.

16:36.464 --> 16:39.653
Mason, sweetheart, what happened?

16:39.659 --> 16:42.268
I did everything she
wanted. It didn't matter.

16:42.337 --> 16:44.052
She snapshattered my heart.

16:46.278 --> 16:48.781
"All these weights,
but we didn't work out."

16:48.787 --> 16:50.269
Oh, that's pretty clever.

16:50.275 --> 16:53.188
"Clever"? It's not clever. It's cruel.

16:53.194 --> 16:55.221
You know, things can be both.

16:56.495 --> 16:58.868
Mason, honey, I know you're hurting,

16:58.874 --> 17:02.477
and I know things seem scary,
but you don't have to be afraid.

17:02.891 --> 17:06.487
This is your chance to
figure out who you are

17:06.492 --> 17:09.664
outside the confines of a relationship.

17:10.590 --> 17:13.500
You've spent so much time...

17:14.202 --> 17:17.398
- taking care of everyone else.
- I have?

17:17.405 --> 17:22.097
And now it's time for you
to try to take care of you.

17:22.103 --> 17:24.307
Nurture your own interests.

17:24.313 --> 17:26.279
Maybe learn to play an instrument.

17:26.285 --> 17:27.924
- I play piano.
- Or travel.

17:27.930 --> 17:29.611
You've always wanted to see Europe.

17:29.617 --> 17:30.863
I'm a high-school student.

17:30.869 --> 17:34.509

17:34.515 --> 17:37.521

Are you having a nervous breakdown?

18:06.090 --> 18:07.304
Lena?

18:08.677 --> 18:09.990
Hey, babe...

18:09.996 --> 18:12.488
good news... I spoke to Lisa Apple.

18:16.568 --> 18:17.768
No.

18:17.774 --> 18:19.867
No, no, you promised. You promised.

18:19.873 --> 18:21.253
- You said that you would wait.
- Martin.

18:21.259 --> 18:23.674
Lisa is not pregnant, okay?

18:23.680 --> 18:26.365
- There's no obstacle other than...
- Me.

18:26.566 --> 18:28.966
I'll just go right
back to the way I was.

18:29.265 --> 18:30.657
I'll put you first.

18:30.663 --> 18:32.675
I will put you first, too.

18:32.947 --> 18:35.107
Okay, I will put you wherever you want.

18:35.113 --> 18:37.262
You just have to just let
me know where to put you.

18:37.268 --> 18:38.722
I don't want to have to tell you.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.618
And trust me... eventually,
you won't want to be told!

18:42.624 --> 18:44.149
But I don't understand.

18:44.155 --> 18:46.359
You know, everything was fine.
We were getting along great.

18:46.365 --> 18:47.741
We... we just had our honeymoon.

18:47.747 --> 18:49.814
Right, and at some
point, the honeymoon ends

18:49.820 --> 18:51.560
and we're back to the day-to-day,

18:51.566 --> 18:55.501
and... and if I'm being honest...

18:56.180 --> 18:57.411
What?

18:58.576 --> 19:03.272
I spent so long wishing
that you still wanted me,

19:03.278 --> 19:07.871
I think I lost sight of whether
or not I still wanted you.

19:10.951 --> 19:13.277
Okay. Wow.

19:14.149 --> 19:15.448
Like...

19:15.690 --> 19:18.454
Seriously, wow.

19:18.460 --> 19:21.878
Martin, you're the one
who has to wait now.

19:22.404 --> 19:26.494
You have to be patient. I-I
can't just let you choose me.

19:26.567 --> 19:29.676
I need to know that
I'm also choosing you.

19:30.004 --> 19:31.303
You know what?

19:31.467 --> 19:34.096
After 16 years of marriage
and this half-assed divorce,

19:34.102 --> 19:35.999
if you still don't know
how you feel about me,

19:36.005 --> 19:38.768
then... oh, my God, you
nutbag... you never will!

19:38.774 --> 19:42.072
- Martin.
- No, there's nothing left to discuss here, Lena.

19:42.267 --> 19:44.383
This little experiment is over.

19:44.389 --> 19:46.673
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means that...

19:46.679 --> 19:48.386
I want out of this arrangement.

19:49.590 --> 19:50.982
I want to sell the house.

20:00.293 --> 20:07.069
♪ One of us is changing, or
maybe we just stopped trying ♪

20:09.217 --> 20:13.158
So, it looks like Lisa
Apple isn't pregnant.

20:13.219 --> 20:14.714
Good.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.334
Cute-ass baby, though.

20:17.340 --> 20:19.425
Little head, big glasses.

20:19.525 --> 20:21.725
At least Lena and Martin are back on.

20:21.827 --> 20:24.893
No, looks like that's
not happening, either.

20:24.899 --> 20:26.985
Aw. What a bummer.

20:26.991 --> 20:28.708
You know what's not a bummer?

20:36.305 --> 20:38.906
I feel like I should
like it more than I do.

20:38.982 --> 20:40.182
You sure?

20:40.188 --> 20:42.479
'Cause I'm really
feeling myself right now.

20:42.485 --> 20:45.583
- Really?
- Yeah, I feel like a member of the Night's Watch.

20:45.589 --> 20:48.806
You look like Count Chocula.
It's a nonstarter for me.

20:49.205 --> 20:50.613
You want to have sex?

20:50.619 --> 20:52.218
It might change your mind.

20:53.815 --> 20:57.049
- Pants off, cape on. Yeah.
- Okay, they're leather. I need your help.
