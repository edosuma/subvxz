Ground zero to eagle one and two, copy.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.920
Eagle two copy.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.514
We have target acknowledgment.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.933
Yeah.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.196
- Range on target?
- 1180.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.366

Red light. No clear shot.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.959
Open fire.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.656
Negative. No clear shot.

06:20.756 --> 06:24.467
<i>Eagle one, this is an order.
Open fire now!</i>

06:24.634 --> 06:27.845
- Negative.
- Target obstructed, Sir. Do it!

06:35.062 --> 06:39.857
Eagle two, eagle one has
malfunctioned. Terminate him.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.736
Damn it, man, just do it! Just do it!

06:53.497 --> 06:56.149
<i>This is an order: Terminate eagle one.</i>

06:56.249 --> 06:59.835
<i>- Go!
- Repeat, terminate eagle one!</i>

07:04.883 --> 07:06.300
Go!

12:43.763 --> 12:46.098
So where do we go from here?

12:46.307 --> 12:48.684
Open the fucking box.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.354
Slowly.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.860
Oh, shit. Mushrooms.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.156
I told you, no mushrooms.

13:08.079 --> 13:12.666
Now I gotta pick 'em off.
One by one.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.238
I'm not laughing.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.465
How about I buy a beer?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.925
Make you feel better?

13:23.386 --> 13:26.722
Trust me, after a couple of nights,
you'll be begging for a little excitement.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.544
This is on e boring tomb.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.396
I'll let you know when I'm that bored.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.982
You do that.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.984
Cheers.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.546
What's this?

14:41.172 --> 14:46.051
Oh, shit. I hope my cable isn't out too.
I'm taping the game.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.516
Shouldn't we be doing something?

15:08.533 --> 15:11.493
Bingo! Back on line.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.022
I'm gonna check it out.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.081
Check what out?

15:18.376 --> 15:22.405
If you don't wanna talk to me,
why don't you just say so?

15:22.505 --> 15:24.199
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- Well, fine.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.702
How long they got you on the shift for?
'Cause I'm having you shifted to mornings.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.845
You're one hell of a pain in the ass!

15:32.515 --> 15:34.292
Eager be avers.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.184
God bless him.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.861
<i>O'Hara?</i>

17:51.821 --> 17:53.864
<i>O'Hara, are you there?</i>

17:54.574 --> 17:56.908
<i>Come on, O'Hara. Copy.</i>

17:58.411 --> 18:00.787
<i>Copy if you're there, O'Hara.</i>

18:02.915 --> 18:04.651
Yeah, yeah. What's up?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.736
A woman with a work order.

18:06.836 --> 18:10.630
Says she's supposed to check out
some computers in the penthouse.

18:13.384 --> 18:17.679
Computers? In an empty
suite on a Sunday night?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.806
<i>What a concept.</i>

18:19.974 --> 18:22.309
<i>Nobody said we'd be having any company.</i>

18:22.727 --> 18:25.187
She must be making one
shitload of overtime.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.397
May I?

18:28.149 --> 18:31.928
That's right. And the people that are paying
your salary are not gonna appreciate...

18:32.028 --> 18:35.056
<i>me wasting my time and
their shitload of money.</i>

18:35.156 --> 18:39.409
Of course. I'm sure they
just forgot to notify us.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.231
Okay, pal. Stop wasting the lady's time.
I'm sure she doesn't wanna be here all night.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.998
<i>I don't.</i>

18:58.846 --> 19:00.707
You'll have to excuse
the accommodations.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.960
Nobody's been too anxious to
cough up the cash to finish this...

19:04.060 --> 19:06.671
- Piece of "techno - Shit"?
- Yeah.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.689
Techno - Shit. I like that.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.067
Elevator's right here.

19:24.747 --> 19:28.365
You know, I could get into this
computer stuff myself. I mean,

19:28.466 --> 19:31.329
- How difficult could it be, right?
- Yeah, right.

19:31.430 --> 19:33.355
So what do you do with them?

19:33.506 --> 19:36.284
I deal with electromagnetic
field interference.

19:36.384 --> 19:40.830
- Like radioactive microwave bullshit, huh?
- Just like that.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.750
How come management never told me
about the penthouse being rented?

19:43.850 --> 19:47.086
I don't know.
Maybe you're just out of the loop.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.189
Ah, yeah. Well, I don't
like being out of the loop.

19:54.944 --> 19:59.781
Especially with some smart-ass bitch
just popping out of the woodwork.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.450
Come here.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.167
T.F.B.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.421
What?

20:14.589 --> 20:18.216
Too fucking bad. Now start the elevator.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.806
You wanna be tough, huh, bitch?

20:26.058 --> 20:30.520
You have five seconds to take
your sticky little fingers off of me.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.131
Four...

20:32.231 --> 20:34.691
You haven't got the balls.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.986
That's about to be your problem.
Three...

20:38.821 --> 20:41.933
- I don't think you can do it.
- I'm sure it's not much of a target,...

20:42.033 --> 20:45.076
but we're at real close range.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.029
So what now,...

20:55.129 --> 20:57.714
- Pretty lady?
- You rest...

21:01.719 --> 21:03.511
for a minute...

21:04.305 --> 21:06.181
and I'll drive.

21:45.513 --> 21:48.833
You know, you're just
a type "a" computer geek,...

21:48.933 --> 21:53.687
right down to your little plastic
pocket protector for your 357.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.189
Well, there's a lot of creeps out there.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.418
See you later.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.171
Not if I see you first.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.063
Fuck! Bitch.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.809
You look worked up.

22:48.909 --> 22:52.329
Shut up, man! I liked you better
when you didn't say anything.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.191
That fuckin' bitch pulled a 357 on me.

22:55.291 --> 22:59.779
Shit! What the fuck is she doing with a 357?
Smoking pimps on market street?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.114
How about keeping a
scumbag like you at bay?

23:02.214 --> 23:04.215
You know, fuck that shit.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.093
What are you doing?

23:07.470 --> 23:11.181
I'm calling the cops to
find out If that gun's legit.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.016
No cops.

23:13.476 --> 23:17.020
You're new around here, so I'll
let you in on a little something.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.732
In this building... we're the cops.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.360
Red.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.445
Two-five.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.076
You.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.985
Ground zero. Ground zero.
This is eagle two.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.349
Ground zero, this is eagle two.
Do you copy?

24:51.449 --> 24:53.934
<i>- Copy.
- I'm at the primary extraction point.</i>

24:54.034 --> 24:57.813
LZ - 1 is hot. I repeat, hot.
This is a priority one...

24:57.913 --> 24:59.956
<i>Eagle two, repeat your priority.</i>

25:01.834 --> 25:03.668
You scared the shit out of me.

25:04.587 --> 25:05.951
- I thought you were dead.
- I'm not.

25:06.052 --> 25:10.842
Listen, there's no time to be scared.
No radio. Repeat, no radio.

25:14.305 --> 25:18.183
We have 12 hours to reach the secondary
extraction point, so check your weapon.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.187
Clean up your face.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.566
Thanks.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.196
- How long you been with the agency?
- A while.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.032
This was my first mission.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.076
Shit.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.292
Okay, rookie.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.780
There's been a major
operational screw - up.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.907
That chopper found us somehow.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.700
If we weren't set up,...

25:51.800 --> 25:55.345
- Had to be the radio transmission.
- What do you mean, "set up"?

25:56.555 --> 25:58.973
It means trust is not a virtue,...

25:59.725 --> 26:03.102
so do what I say, when I say it.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.854
Agreed?

26:07.775 --> 26:09.234
Agreed.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.278
Okay.

26:19.036 --> 26:22.413
Back there, that was my first kill.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.582
They tried to kill you.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.168
Do you remember your first kill?

26:28.963 --> 26:31.214
I didn't have a choice.
There was a war going on.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.974
The difference is, in war,...

26:41.767 --> 26:43.810
at least you know who the enemy is.

27:07.585 --> 27:09.377
Surprised?

27:10.004 --> 27:12.255
It's not the word I'd use.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.133
Maybe history's repeating itself.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.927
This time is different.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.846
It's never different.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.348
Why did they have to send you?

27:23.434 --> 27:26.019
Because I get along with everybody.

27:26.729 --> 27:29.006
- I wouldn't brag about that.
- Why not?

27:29.106 --> 27:31.649
Some people are better
not getting along with.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.832
Someone's coming.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.669
That way it's easier to kill them.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.133
Pretty lady. Come on, open up.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.553
Open the fucking door!

28:02.514 --> 28:05.167
- I just wanna talk.
- I'd like that.

28:05.267 --> 28:10.021
But I really can't right now.
I have this delicate equipment at work.

28:11.398 --> 28:15.068
How about working on my
"delicate equipment"?

28:16.320 --> 28:21.366
- What do you want?
- I just wanna apologize for before.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.160
You know I didn't mean anything by it.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.621
Apology's accepted.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.857
Now get lost!

28:28.957 --> 28:32.585
You're just making it fucking difficult
on yourself being a bitch again!

28:34.963 --> 28:38.508
That's okay. Really doesn't bother me.

28:38.717 --> 28:44.722
Because I'd really love
to treat you like one.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.644
And your fucking 357
ain't gonna stop me.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.698
Guess you didn't get
along with him, did you?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.158
Take the knife down.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.499
Ever seen your agency profile?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.402
It's classified information.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.504
- You didn't answer the question.
- I haven't seen it.

29:20.551 --> 29:26.013
I've seen mine. Says I'm... paranoid.

29:28.142 --> 29:30.002
Do you think I'm paranoid?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.978
Not necessarily.

29:36.108 --> 29:39.193
I think you may have been
on the job a little too long.

29:46.410 --> 29:47.744
Nice.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.831
Well,...

29:54.334 --> 29:57.086
looks like I have at least
one reason to be paranoid.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.299
Listen to me.

30:01.508 --> 30:06.679
I'm not a rookie anymore, and I'm not
gonna take an y of your shit, all right?

30:07.139 --> 30:10.167
I have a job to do,
and the weapon is part of it.

30:10.267 --> 30:13.686
I'm your spotter,
and we both know procedure.

30:13.896 --> 30:16.689
Exactly. That's why I'm keeping the gun.

30:18.609 --> 30:22.278
I had no idea that it was you. None.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.363
I swear.

30:25.199 --> 30:27.575
I would've taken a section delta.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.369
Why didn't the supervisor tell you?

30:30.537 --> 30:33.816
I don't know.
I've never even met the guy.

30:33.916 --> 30:38.544
You don't meet the guy. When you meet
the guy is when you know you're dead.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.799
Yeah, well, that's the
paranoid speaking.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.634
I wish it was.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.365
Not good.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.687
- Not good at all.
- What's your fucking problem, man?

31:11.787 --> 31:13.955
I was just about to ask
you the same thing.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.984
We're the cops in
this building, remember?

31:17.084 --> 31:18.402
That's right.

31:18.502 --> 31:21.363
And you left the ground station
in the middle of a shift.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.157
- Your shift.
- That's bullshit.

31:23.257 --> 31:26.452
What that is, is me doing your job.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.829
And frankly, they don't
pay me enough for that.

31:28.929 --> 31:31.165
I was checking things out.

31:31.265 --> 31:35.335
- Like what, the curve of her behind?
- Ah, screw this shit.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.311
I'm writing you up.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.481
What?

31:41.233 --> 31:43.526
I think you heard what I said.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.653
Son of a bitch.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.533
Fuck you.

31:51.743 --> 31:56.372
Fuck you. Fuck her. Fuck 'em all.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.670
Let's get on with the program.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.674
I know the drill.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.634
Do you?

32:15.851 --> 32:17.935
Gimme the dope on the parameter.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.106
Two security guards.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.469
One's new and by the book,
the other's a bully.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.987
- Nothing special.
- All right.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.908
Let's get up close and personal.

32:34.369 --> 32:38.497
Fifty caliber match grade.
Hardened tungsten - Carbide penetrator.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.835
High explosive incendiary core.
Heavy armor piercing.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.281
Outstanding. Maybe I'll have
you pull the trigger this time.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.575
I'm just the spotter, remember?

32:48.675 --> 32:51.677
Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting
why you're here.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.718
It looks like she's working in the dark.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.306
Did you hear what I said?

33:38.850 --> 33:40.851
They're fixing the building.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.355
Who's fixing the building?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.023
My buddies.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.318
Your buddies?

33:49.695 --> 33:52.238
They don't like what's going on here.

33:55.409 --> 33:56.951
Boys!

33:58.578 --> 34:01.247
Say hello to my new co - Worker.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.286
Very lifelike.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.889
They don't like her all alone up there.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.185
So I'm gonna have some fun tonight.

34:25.355 --> 34:27.299
Something funny going on with her.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.301
Maybe we should have
checked her out some more.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.360
I did check her out.

34:31.527 --> 34:36.032
And me thinks me likes what me saw.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.645
What are you doing there?

34:39.745 --> 34:42.038
Just getting prettied up for my date.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.542
Would you mind telling
me what's going on here?

34:48.295 --> 34:50.045
Body armor.

34:50.589 --> 34:54.925
Threat level 4-A. Serious shit.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.720
She's gonna love this.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.730
All right.

35:08.523 --> 35:11.927
We're to greet the target at
the base of the bridge at 0800.

35:12.027 --> 35:16.405
The vehicle, possibly armored,
traveling north-south at 40 miles an hour.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.327
Dope me a preliminary range.

35:33.006 --> 35:35.216
1800 to 2000.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.344
It's a hell of a shot.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.889
That's more than a mile.

35:43.225 --> 35:44.517
Right.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.145
I'm going to the roof.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.986
Why are you going up there?

35:56.571 --> 35:59.141
Procedure, spotter.
Always secure high ground.

35:59.241 --> 36:03.369
Yeah, well, that falls
under my job... and my gun.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.080
What gun?

36:07.082 --> 36:09.333
Can't quite seem to recall right now.

36:11.253 --> 36:14.906
There's an old saying:
"Just because you're paranoid...

36:15.006 --> 36:17.034
doesn't mean they're
not out to get you."

36:17.134 --> 36:20.052
Yeah, well that's not a saying.
It's a joke.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.680
An old joke.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.932
Really?

36:26.351 --> 36:27.852
I never laughed.

36:38.405 --> 36:39.822
Down.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.029
What's wrong?

36:54.129 --> 36:57.464
Just wait here. Keep your eyes open.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.321
So much for keeping your eyes open.

38:02.739 --> 38:05.241
- Shit.
- All right, kid. Let's go.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.117
Limo's waiting.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.335
So, how are we doing?

38:17.170 --> 38:21.215
Great. Mission was a failure and
we're running for our lives.

38:21.967 --> 38:25.970
- Yeah, well, I meant time wise.
- We'll be there by dusk.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.847
Weren't we supposed to
approach by the water?

38:36.523 --> 38:39.650
- What are you doing?
- Slide over and drive.

38:40.777 --> 38:42.653
Yes!

38:47.117 --> 38:49.868
That'll give you something
else to do besides talk.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.629
Are you looking for me?

43:13.716 --> 43:17.010
That was not funny,
sneaking up on me like that.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.350
You mind telling me what you
were doing on the roof?

43:39.450 --> 43:41.269
What are you talking about?

43:41.369 --> 43:43.980
We got a warning signal
from the security system.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.623
Well, your system is malfunctioning.

44:03.099 --> 44:05.251
You're telling me you
didn't open that door?

44:05.351 --> 44:07.269
Why would I open that door?

44:07.729 --> 44:09.896
I'm working in the penthouse.

44:24.662 --> 44:28.999
You know, I think your buddy
has you a little jumpy.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.919
He's not my buddy.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.964
Then is this settled?

44:36.507 --> 44:38.884
Because I'd like to go back to work.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.763
It's settled.

45:05.370 --> 45:06.995
Anything else?

45:07.497 --> 45:08.997
I don't think so.

45:09.499 --> 45:10.999
Good.

45:18.508 --> 45:21.885
Because I wouldn't want you to come
all the way up here again for nothing.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.299
Come on!

46:03.010 --> 46:05.387
Come on! Grab me.

46:33.082 --> 46:35.459
So how's the paranoia level?

46:37.587 --> 46:39.296
Under control.

46:40.006 --> 46:41.465
Yeah?

46:43.718 --> 46:45.844
Well, don't get too comfy.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.390
Hey, spotter.

46:51.684 --> 46:53.185
Thank you.

46:53.895 --> 46:55.395
Forget it.

46:56.314 --> 46:59.816
It's just part of my job,
keeping you alive so you can do yours.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.819
This time.

47:29.222 --> 47:31.139
Soldier's best friend.

47:38.397 --> 47:39.940
I'll pass.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.891
Jesus Christ!

47:48.991 --> 47:51.227
Me and that chopper didn't get along.

47:51.327 --> 47:54.412
- No shit!
- Want to play doctor?

48:17.728 --> 48:19.855
What the fuck is this?

48:20.565 --> 48:24.359
Shit. Don't stop. Run 'em over.

48:25.069 --> 48:26.736
Keep going.

48:44.881 --> 48:46.256
Passport.

48:47.049 --> 48:48.425
Duck!

50:16.555 --> 50:18.390
I told you not to stop.

51:54.070 --> 51:55.528
Range.

52:01.035 --> 52:02.827
Eighteen hundred.

52:10.252 --> 52:12.253
I shouldn't be here.

52:13.923 --> 52:16.049
Not after last time.

52:16.467 --> 52:18.426
It doesn't matter anymore.

52:18.636 --> 52:20.470
Why not?

52:20.888 --> 52:22.847
Too much was lost.

52:23.516 --> 52:25.517
Well, how would you get it back?

52:27.812 --> 52:29.312
You don't.

52:31.857 --> 52:33.358
Ever?

52:42.660 --> 52:45.912
- I don't know.
- Well, what do you know?

52:49.708 --> 52:51.167
I think we should at least...

53:27.037 --> 53:29.414
Well, I told you I'd be back.

53:29.999 --> 53:31.875
I've been expecting you.

53:35.629 --> 53:38.157
My partner's very worried about you.

53:38.257 --> 53:42.302
Tell your partner I really
appreciate his concern.

53:43.512 --> 53:45.096
Well,...

53:45.598 --> 53:47.348
how about my concern?

53:50.728 --> 53:52.812
A little short of breath?

54:03.240 --> 54:06.409
Oh, fuck you very much.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.873
"Ker-pow"

54:21.926 --> 54:24.260
Now I can show you my piece.

54:28.599 --> 54:33.478
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Slow down.
We don't wanna forget safe sex, do we?

54:38.150 --> 54:44.113
We can do this the easy
way Or we can do it...

54:45.032 --> 54:47.075
the fucking hard way.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.287
Which way do you like it?

54:51.497 --> 54:53.164
The hard way.

54:58.545 --> 55:00.463
Who the fuck are you?

55:01.632 --> 55:04.842
- Who do you want me to be?
- How about dead, asshole?

55:07.263 --> 55:11.808
I'll fucking blow her brains out.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

55:12.351 --> 55:14.102
Take your best shot.

55:17.106 --> 55:18.690
You first.

55:23.570 --> 55:24.988
No, no.

55:26.115 --> 55:27.573
After you.

55:40.713 --> 55:42.297
Three's a crowd.

55:49.430 --> 55:51.180
Hey, hey!

55:57.604 --> 55:59.480
Come on! Dance, boy!

56:08.949 --> 56:11.034
She's a hell of a date!

56:21.628 --> 56:23.046
Come on.

56:36.894 --> 56:38.269
Come on.

57:48.715 --> 57:52.969
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who the fuck are you?

57:53.387 --> 57:57.124
- You have no idea who you're dealing with.
- Oh, yeah?

57:57.224 --> 58:00.017
Well, first I'm gonna take
care of this piece of shit.

58:00.394 --> 58:03.980
And then I'm gonna come
back and fuck you to death.

58:05.566 --> 58:07.358
Don't go anywhere.

59:30.859 --> 59:32.193
Hold on!

59:34.279 --> 59:35.863
Take my hand!

59:36.907 --> 59:39.033
It's a great day to fly!

59:46.208 --> 59:48.167
Fasten your seat belt.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.702
<i>G-1? Penthouse.</i>

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.022
Ground station. Copy.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.748
<i>Just making sure you stay put.</i>

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:30.209
Is there a problem?

01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:33.254
I think I'm gonna get some.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.049
Really? Well, enjoy.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.765
You may not know this,...

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.605
but you're one lucky scumbag.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:46.869
You okay?

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:02.343
You want me to leave you alone?

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:06.263
Let me ask you something.

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.600
We both knew you had to do it, right?

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.796
Do what?

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:16.273
Was it because of the sniping
station or because of me?

01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:20.569
Does it matter?

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.200
It does to me.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.923
Do they have names?

01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:44.620
Who?

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.179
The people we kill.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.477
They're not people. They're targets.

01:02:56.523 --> 01:03:00.985
No names, no faces, no identities.

01:03:04.156 --> 01:03:07.074
You mean you never wonder?

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:11.829
Never.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:17.460
The moment you hesitate,
that's when you know you're finished.

01:03:24.593 --> 01:03:27.261
It wasn't because of
the sniping station.

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:34.503
What?

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:36.645
I heard a sound.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:41.567
It's the wind.

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:44.320
I learned about the wind.

01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:46.864
In the war?

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:48.574
Yeah.

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:53.120
The enemy was different then, wasn't it?

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:54.705
Yeah.

01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:00.920
Tell me what changed.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:10.095
The war ended, but the hunt didn't.

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.727
I started to doubt.

01:04:16.978 --> 01:04:18.979
I started to see...

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:24.026
the eyes of the enemy.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:29.448
The face of the enemy.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.290
It was the face in the mirror.

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:30.885
Let's go!

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:01.165
How far to the extraction point?

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.792
One or two wars away.

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:06.420
I'm not laughing.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.716
We're never gonna make it.
We're dead.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.388
You're not dead till I
tell you you're dead.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.274
Keep your head down.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.485
And don't go anywhere.

01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:03.560
Ground zero, ground zero,
this is eagle two. Do you copy?

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:06.131
Ground zero, this is eagle two.
Do you copy?

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:08.842
<i>- Copy.
- Shit. We have a double red here.</i>

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:10.635
<i>Have you terminated him?</i>

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:12.971
What the fuck,
we're under fire right now.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:15.932
<i>That's the order.
He didn't fire on the target.</i>

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:19.284
<i>- He's expendable.
- Now listen up, you son of a...</i>

01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:22.955
<i>Eagle two.</i>

01:07:23.999 --> 01:07:26.375
<i>Eagle two, do you copy?</i>

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:30.629
<i>Eagle two, you have a termination order.</i>

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.183
He's gone, hasn't he?

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:35.355
It's a long way down.

01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:38.192
What are we gonna do?

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:42.696
You do what you have to do...

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.366
and so will I.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.508
Oh, shit, man!

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:20.567
Help me out here!

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:25.098
Taking a lotta crap lately?

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:28.935
That ain't funny. There's nothin'
fuckin' funny about this, just...

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:32.955
Just get this shit off me,
you fucking asshole.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.458
Resisted your
irresistible charms, did she?

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.753
Well, don't take it too hard.

01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:42.422
You and that toilet...

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.925
you look very good together.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:48.371
Where you going? Where you going?

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:51.014
Come back! Hey!

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:54.059
She didn't do this to me, you know.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:59.340
- There's a fuckin' guy up there.
- Who might this individual be?

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.026
I don't know. He's a fucking
mean son of a bitch.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.239
We're calling the cops.

01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:10.826
He could come down here any second.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.646
I don't think that's an option
the gentleman is considering.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:16.707
Yeah, I don't give a
fuck what you think.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.350
Some days it's just not worth
getting off the toilet.

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:50.198
Supervisor to all stations.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.451
Stand by.

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:15.409
Let's do it right this time.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.370
After all...

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:22.249
this is the end of the line.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.294
What are you talking about?

01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:31.466
My final target.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:38.098
<i>Ground zero to eagle one and two.</i>

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:40.517
<i>Target approaching kill zone.</i>

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:42.602
Eagle two copy.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:46.314
We have target acknowledgment.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.316
Eagle one copy.

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:53.738
- Range.
- Two thousand, decreasing.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.207
Wind age.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.340
Full force crosswind:
15 knots standard.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.077
Bring it right.

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:15.969
Ten clicks.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:25.979
Target entering kill zone.
Mid - Sector.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:28.356
Range: On target.

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:32.053
Nineteen hundred, forward lead.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:33.737
Four mills.

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:39.367
<i>It's time.</i>

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.709
We have green light.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:54.466
Those who don't remember the past...

01:15:57.637 --> 01:16:00.180
will be condemned to live it again.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:12.484
Do it.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:26.957
You're all grown up now.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:30.544
You do it.

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.750
Looks like someone didn't trust us.

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:54.502
Well, you didn't fire on the target.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:01.536
- Do what you have to.
- You didn't do your job.

01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:03.970
You didn't do it then...

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:10.060
and you didn't do it now.

01:18:13.731 --> 01:18:16.191
Just remember the face in the mirror.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.302
You can walk out of here.

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:20.278
Out of the whole system.

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:24.032
We can both walk.

01:22:26.901 --> 01:22:29.152
Some retirement party.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:35.992
So where's the bar?

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:35.677
Do you know who I am?

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.555
I do now...

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:41.975
Sir.

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.644
It's a real loss.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.854
He was the best.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:49.482
You hesitated.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.069
Which leads me to believe
Either you couldn't kill him...

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:55.571
Or you didn't want to.

01:23:57.574 --> 01:24:00.702
You have a chance to
come back to the family.

01:24:01.912 --> 01:24:03.913
Don't hesitate again.

01:24:08.419 --> 01:24:10.211
I won't.

01:24:11.422 --> 01:24:14.298
I guess if you want a
job done properly...

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:17.677
you just have to do it yourself.

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:20.831
Well, that would be an
unnecessary overkill...

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:22.306
Sir.

01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:27.228
- Seems we have a problem.
- We certainly do.

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:34.360
- You are way out of line.
- And it is such an imperfect world...

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:36.029
isn't it?

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:43.870
I am done with the
order of the day, Sir.

01:24:45.873 --> 01:24:48.750
Well, then, If it's all
the same to you...

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:51.169
I'll be leaving.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:06.976
Ma y I offer you a ride?

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:09.812
I'm in no particular hurry.

01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:14.442
It's a long way down to the bottom.

01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:16.944
I'll walk.

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:35.463
<i>Guess what?</i>

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.175
<i>The elevator is out of order.</i>

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:43.930
<i>Nothing new.
Life's only death postponed.</i>

01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:46.182
<i>I told you to walk, didn't I?</i>

01:25:47.305 --> 01:25:53.247
