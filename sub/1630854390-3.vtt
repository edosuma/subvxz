WEBVTT

00:26.193 --> 00:27.444
That must be it.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.562
Thank you.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.276
Hey.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.278
Allie.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.823
You're expecting us. Allie.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.211
Follow the guy.

01:47.858 --> 01:48.859
Sigame.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.160
Sigame.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.906
Hey!

02:52.631 --> 02:53.966
Allie.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.344
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

02:59.888 --> 03:00.889
Margot.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.350
You look good, considering.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.937
Still sore I introduced you
to your husband?

03:07.312 --> 03:08.772
Well, couldn't be happier.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.526
-This is Charlie and Dina.
-Dina.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.610
Hi.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.363
I can see your father in you.

03:16.905 --> 03:17.906
Charlie.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.160
Gracias, Fermin.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.705
You guys must be tired.
Shall we get you to your house?

03:25.664 --> 03:26.832
Come on. Follow me.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.203
I know it doesn't seem like it,

04:04.953 --> 04:06.747
but everyone here is just like you,

04:07.915 --> 04:11.460
forced to leave everything
behind to rebuild with us.

04:15.881 --> 04:20.260
We stood against the world's destruction,
and now find refuge at Casa Roja.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.973
But I do need you to be aware that this
is not a hotel or a wellness retreat.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.642
This is a working community.

04:27.226 --> 04:30.854
So, we'll give you a few days to settle in
before we discuss work rosters.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.484
Talk tomorrow. Have a good night.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.634
I'm sorry if it doesn't seem to be
what I promised.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.263
But…

05:05.430 --> 05:07.349
it's never easy
to arrive somewhere at night.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.394
Tired, you're dirty and hungry.

05:11.603 --> 05:15.148
And these people,
they don't trust strangers.

05:17.693 --> 05:20.946
But… we won't be strangers here for long.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.913
Hola.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.291
Morning, Silvia. Not many today.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.630
-Great.
-Okay.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.555
Charlie?

07:59.229 --> 08:00.522
-Uh-huh.
-Yes, Silvia.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.196
-Sí. Sí. Smart.
-Smart. Smart.

08:07.279 --> 08:10.032
Yes. Thank you. I'll go find Charlie.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.116
Charlie.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.748
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.584
-Hola.
-Hola.

08:30.636 --> 08:31.678
How's it going?

08:33.263 --> 08:35.682
I hate this thing. I want it to die.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.769
Well, not until you've gotten milk.
Otherwise, Silvia's gonna kill me.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.855
-Have you seen your brother?
-No. Do you want me to find him?

08:41.938 --> 08:44.232
Sure, once you've emptied the goat.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.479
Hey.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.275
Hey.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.405
It's pretty crazy, right?

09:32.698 --> 09:36.785
How they traveled 3,000 miles
from the US and Canada just to breed here.

09:40.706 --> 09:41.707
Yeah.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.750
It's insane.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.504
You know they sleep together like that
to keep each other warm?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.598
How long have you been out here?

10:02.728 --> 10:04.897
Shit, have you been out here all night
in the jungle?

10:04.980 --> 10:05.981
Rain forest.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.067
Anyway, it's time to go.
It's your turn for breakfast.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.695
You're in the shit with Silvia.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.321
Gracias.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.117
Charlie?

11:01.370 --> 11:02.371
Charlie?

11:18.971 --> 11:20.889
You spent the night in the jungle again.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.059
Some of it, yeah.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.811
Nice to see you're enjoying it.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.273
I love it too.
Have since I was a little girl.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.608
Much younger than you.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.781
How far do you go?

11:39.366 --> 11:40.367
On your travels?

11:42.160 --> 11:45.038
He doesn't go far.
He stays safe and whatever.

11:46.582 --> 11:51.670
Good. Good, 'cause I need you
to be careful to not stray too far off.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.047
Specifically, to not be seen.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.716
-You understand?
-Of course.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.221
Just remember, stay on this side
of the big rock formation to the north,

12:01.847 --> 12:04.183
and the lake to the west. Yeah?

12:04.266 --> 12:06.059
That should give you enough space to roam.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.645
After all, you're not an alux.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.731
-A what?
-An alux.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.692
-What's that?
-Look it up. We have a library.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.412
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THIS GUY
WILLIAM LEE IS STILL LOOKING.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.626
DO I HAVE TO WORRY?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.422
HARD TO SAY. HE'S A BLOODHOUND.
HE'S MOTIVATED.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.424
AND VERY DANGEROUS. I DON'T
KNOW IF IT'S WORTH THE RISK.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.518
WE NEED IT.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.312
SO IT'S A RISK WE HAVE TO TAKE.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.656
Come on.

13:47.369 --> 13:50.747
-Where've you been?
-Looking at butterflies.

13:51.582 --> 13:54.668
-Again?
-Yeah, there was more today.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.421
Whatever.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.215
There's a breakfast roster,
and you're still on it. Go shower.

14:00.299 --> 14:03.135
-Wait, I have to help Dad with--
-Yeah, after your chores. Look at you.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.219
Go shower.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.138
Okay.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.604
Did you tell him anything?

14:14.313 --> 14:16.106
No way. Not yet.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.342
Jesus fucking Christ!

14:43.842 --> 14:46.929
-Hey! Language!
-It's cold.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.806
Yeah, well, suck it up. It's good for you.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.642
Endorphins.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.615
Gracias.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.542
Okay.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.177
So, does this remind you of home?

15:27.261 --> 15:30.013
Us preparing breakfast together like this?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.473
Not really.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.395
I miss home sometimes.

15:38.564 --> 15:39.815
I miss my books.

15:42.317 --> 15:45.237
But it's nice. I think Dad was right.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.823
Well, he usually is.

15:49.408 --> 15:52.953
-I'll tell him you said that.
-I'll deny it.

16:03.422 --> 16:04.715
Are you okay, Dad?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.302
What have you been doing?
I haven't seen you in, like, two days.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.470
Yeah. Just been busy.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.681
Now I can breathe. I belong here.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.767
Told you this place would be something,
right?

16:15.851 --> 16:18.562
What it is. What it can become.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.774
What about you kids?
You guys holding down the fort?

16:22.858 --> 16:25.819
If you call looking at butterflies
holding down the fort.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.449
I'm gonna need you guys
down at the dock today.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.534
Magdalena's coming in. That means work.

16:32.618 --> 16:33.994
But we got the books.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.373
I stripped down the generator.
I can't find anything wrong with it.

16:38.457 --> 16:41.168
-What's the problem?
-It's just a thousand years old,

16:41.251 --> 16:42.461
chewing through gas.

16:46.507 --> 16:50.093
-Morning. Mind if I join you?
-Yeah.

16:51.345 --> 16:52.346
Gracias.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.891
Dina, I hear you're making progress
with the goat.

16:56.975 --> 16:57.976
I guess.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.731
I still think I, sort of, stick out
like a sore thumb, though.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.025
You shouldn't. You're one of us.

17:05.108 --> 17:08.779
Everyone around here has
come through the same difficult journey.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.323
Silvia, from the kitchen,

17:11.406 --> 17:14.826
she was protesting the destruction
of a howler monkey's habitat.

17:14.910 --> 17:18.038
An American corporation wanted
to clear the land to grow avocados,

17:18.121 --> 17:20.415
so the local Mafia shot her three times.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.626
Over avocados?

17:23.210 --> 17:25.712
Oh, yeah. There's big money in avocados.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.257
Silvia lived, her husband didn't.

17:28.339 --> 17:32.344
And Anjelica, Anjelica was trying
to prevent another multinational

17:32.427 --> 17:35.097
from dredging sand and stone
in the Usumacinta River.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.598
And Cristina--

17:36.682 --> 17:38.559
She lost five family members

17:38.642 --> 17:41.311
defending ancestral land
in the Sierra Tarahumara.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.524
So, as you can see, very specific
injustices have brought us all here.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.152
Is refuge permanent?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.613
Or do they get to go back
and face their demons?

17:51.697 --> 17:53.115
That depends on their demons.

17:54.408 --> 17:59.162
But what keeps us safe around here
is community, solidarity.

17:59.246 --> 18:03.333
Plus, a little bit of secrecy
and a lot of caution.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.295
So, trust your dad.
I think he's got it covered.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.464
By fixing soccer lights?

18:09.548 --> 18:11.341
-You better believe it.
-Football.

18:11.425 --> 18:15.220
And around here, people believe
it's a matter of life and death.

18:15.304 --> 18:18.056
But I can assure you
it's so much more important than that.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.101
See? We're all a team here.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.386
Gringo.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.059
I don't really play soccer.

19:09.942 --> 19:10.943
Okay.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.820
Yeah.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.788
-Defend.
-Okay. Okay.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.081
-Nombre?
-Charlie.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.501
Charlie. Adalberto.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.419
-Adal.
-Adalber-- Adal--

19:29.503 --> 19:30.629
Call me Adal.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.047
-Adal? Okay.
-Adal.

19:59.241 --> 20:02.202
I see you figured out how to divert
the water to your engine.

20:02.286 --> 20:04.037
You know how to read my elevations?

20:04.121 --> 20:06.248
Yeah, Dad. I know how it works.

20:08.292 --> 20:12.045
You're wasting all this copper.
Why not just fix what's already there?

20:12.129 --> 20:13.714
Well, everyone's praying to that altar,

20:13.797 --> 20:16.800
but Maximón isn't
gonna breathe life into that hunk of junk.

20:16.884 --> 20:21.555
The sun will outlast us, though.
So, I'm gonna build a solar-based engine.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.853
-What's up?
-Nothing.

20:27.936 --> 20:28.937
No?

20:30.397 --> 20:31.440
Something must be up.

20:32.441 --> 20:35.694
I was just wondering who we speak to.
You know?

20:36.403 --> 20:37.404
About what?

20:37.905 --> 20:39.781
About my passport.

20:40.866 --> 20:43.243
Get to this place. Get a passport.

20:44.995 --> 20:45.996
That was the plan.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.210
Just need a little more time, honey.

20:55.756 --> 20:56.798
Yeah, of course.

20:56.882 --> 21:01.470
I know it's not happening tomorrow,
or anything, so…

21:07.809 --> 21:09.811
So, what is the plan?

21:13.941 --> 21:15.901
-"The plan"?
-The plan.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.236
What's the plan?

21:17.319 --> 21:18.737
The plan. Everybody needs a plan.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.822
-What's the plan?
-Get back, basically.

21:21.740 --> 21:22.950
Find a place to stay.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.747
-What about money?
-I can find a job, Dad.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.875
I've been working for you
for 15 years for free.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.044
Okay.

21:37.965 --> 21:41.635
It's… gonna happen, right?

21:44.930 --> 21:46.682
The way you said it was gonna happen.

21:50.227 --> 21:51.353
It's gonna work out.

21:52.312 --> 21:56.942
Yeah. I just gotta… figure out when
I can afford to lose my best employee.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.030
Okay.

22:04.783 --> 22:05.784
Cool, then.

22:27.764 --> 22:28.932
Charlie!

22:36.857 --> 22:38.650
-Hustle. Come on. Okay?
-Okay.

22:44.239 --> 22:45.741
Yeah!

23:00.672 --> 23:01.757
Hey, Adolfo.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.217
Buenos días.

23:14.228 --> 23:15.229
Hey, Ridley.

23:15.938 --> 23:16.939
How's it going, kid?

23:17.940 --> 23:19.233
Pretty good.

23:19.316 --> 23:20.817
So, where's the top banana?

23:21.485 --> 23:22.486
The what?

23:24.238 --> 23:25.239
The big cheese.

23:26.907 --> 23:29.409
I think he's on his way.

23:29.493 --> 23:32.454
Yeah. I bet.

23:33.956 --> 23:37.417
This is the last of the vegetable oil.
All bought and paid for.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.755
Are you guys planning some kinda cookout?

23:43.006 --> 23:44.049
Who knows?

23:48.095 --> 23:50.806
Dolfo, make yourself useful.
Help the young woman out.

23:50.889 --> 23:51.890
Sure, yeah.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.270
-It's okay.
-No, I got it.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.564
No, no. It's fine. I got it.

23:58.647 --> 24:00.357
There's magic everywhere

24:00.858 --> 24:06.113
When you're young and in love

24:23.505 --> 24:26.550
You source this stuff discreetly?
No paper trail, nothing like that?

24:26.633 --> 24:28.093
Why, what do you care?

24:28.802 --> 24:31.221
Looks like you bought a whole library.
What's it for?

24:36.101 --> 24:38.812
I don't know what to tell you.
I guess we're a family of readers.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.273
I've just been wondering,

24:41.356 --> 24:44.568
does Isela know about
the antics your boy pulled back in Mexico?

24:53.994 --> 24:55.704
Vamos, Charlie. Charlie!

24:58.999 --> 25:00.417
Charlie, come on!

25:17.476 --> 25:18.477
I didn't even touch him.

25:21.230 --> 25:23.982
It's like my dad's specialty.

25:24.066 --> 25:26.902
A thousand and one uses
for old cooking oil.

25:32.199 --> 25:33.867
Not here. Just, come.

25:42.626 --> 25:43.627
Thanks.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.046
How often…

25:46.129 --> 25:48.882
do you use this stuff?

25:48.966 --> 25:50.968
So far?

25:51.051 --> 25:51.927
Never.

25:52.678 --> 25:54.054
I get bored sometimes.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.597
Of course, I get that. I mean…

25:55.681 --> 25:56.765
You?

25:57.641 --> 26:00.435
Not me, I don't even smoke weed.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.356
I did stuff when I was a kid…

26:05.524 --> 26:07.234
But I started exercising.

26:08.193 --> 26:11.822
Running and working out.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.365
It makes you feel better.

26:13.448 --> 26:14.449
You should try it.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.993
Ditch this bullshit.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.911
It makes you feel better, I swear.

26:17.995 --> 26:18.996
Totally.

26:19.079 --> 26:22.708
But, don't tell my dad about this though.

26:22.791 --> 26:23.792
Dina, por favor.

26:27.796 --> 26:28.797
Thanks.

26:37.556 --> 26:40.350
Better get back to the oil.

26:40.434 --> 26:42.436
Hey, but if…

26:42.519 --> 26:46.023
you're still bored, we could…

26:46.106 --> 26:48.775
-hang out.
-Yeah, sure!

26:48.859 --> 26:49.860
Okay.

26:51.528 --> 26:52.863
Wait--

26:52.946 --> 26:54.656
When are you coming back?

26:54.740 --> 26:56.325
Tomorrow.

26:56.408 --> 26:57.659
Tomorrow,

26:57.743 --> 27:01.205
Ridley cut a deal with Isela
to buy your dad's boat.

27:05.334 --> 27:06.335
My dad's trawler?

27:06.919 --> 27:09.004
Isela's trawler.

27:09.671 --> 27:10.672
Why?

27:12.174 --> 27:15.511
I guess no one owns anything here.

27:15.594 --> 27:17.679
Or everyone owns everything.

27:17.763 --> 27:20.140
Either way, Isela looks after it.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.627
We won.

28:31.503 --> 28:32.504
Yeah?

28:32.588 --> 28:34.756
I feel like I could actually be
a pretty good goalie.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.843
I mean, if I kept practicing
and learned some stuff.

28:38.635 --> 28:39.636
Yeah.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.099
Yeah, it's good.

28:44.183 --> 28:45.184
Go get your mother.

29:27.142 --> 29:28.185
Mom.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.193
Mom.

29:37.027 --> 29:38.070
Mom, come on.

29:39.738 --> 29:40.864
Dad needs you!

29:43.283 --> 29:44.826
So, where's the fire?

29:44.910 --> 29:46.995
There's no fire.
Dad just wanted me to come get you.

29:47.079 --> 29:48.330
What? Now? Why?

29:48.413 --> 29:50.123
I don't know.
He just said to come find you.

30:00.759 --> 30:01.760
Mom.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.225
Allie?

30:09.560 --> 30:11.228
You come in here for a second?

30:29.288 --> 30:32.165
I mean,
we could get you a laptop or something.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.751
There'd be no Internet, but…

30:38.422 --> 30:40.090
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.552
Right? Here.

30:45.554 --> 30:47.848
Desk's a little crude. I made it.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.364
Satisfying action, right?

31:05.949 --> 31:08.493
They really knew
how to build those things.

31:09.161 --> 31:13.332
I have a whole bunch of ribbons too.
You'll never run out of ribbons or paper.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.126
I want you to be happy here.

31:16.210 --> 31:18.545
It was a rough start,
but there's a good life here.

31:20.088 --> 31:23.509
I don't--
How long have you been planning this?

31:25.093 --> 31:26.512
I don't know. A while.

31:32.059 --> 31:33.060
I know you miss it.

31:35.354 --> 31:36.688
It was just a thesis.

31:38.273 --> 31:41.860
No, it was more than a thesis.
It was a book, and it still is.

31:43.403 --> 31:45.864
Sure, maybe. A small press at best.

31:46.698 --> 31:47.824
Here.

31:48.992 --> 31:51.203
It's not much of a library,
but it's a start.

31:56.333 --> 31:57.668
I don't know what to say.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.977
Well, the way I figure it,

32:57.060 --> 33:02.608
you got, maybe,
one more chance to answer the question.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.529
Come on.

33:08.488 --> 33:10.490
These people can't be worth all this.

33:12.451 --> 33:13.452
Where'd they go?

33:16.163 --> 33:17.748
You really don't know, do you?

33:19.791 --> 33:21.835
You really don't know where they went.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.548
Why did you tell me that you did?

33:28.050 --> 33:30.052
Think you're just making an easy buck?

33:33.972 --> 33:35.766
How easy is that looking now?

33:53.283 --> 33:54.535
Lucrecia,

33:55.452 --> 33:56.537
we lost 'em.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.041
I'm sorry.

34:42.206 --> 34:44.918
Lucrecia, still there?

34:48.922 --> 34:51.007
Now, what just transpired--

34:52.967 --> 34:54.719
I know I let you down.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.932
And it's not like you didn't warn me
what might happen,

34:59.016 --> 35:00.601
so on that front, we're good.

35:02.269 --> 35:07.399
But it's looking
like our contract has timed-out.

35:09.443 --> 35:10.777
Well, okay then.

35:11.528 --> 35:12.529
Adios.

35:42.267 --> 35:43.268
Mom.

35:45.812 --> 35:46.980
They're selling the trawler.

35:50.859 --> 35:53.445
What do you mean? Who-- Who's selling it?

35:53.529 --> 35:54.613
Isela to Ridley.

35:57.908 --> 35:59.910
Mom, we need to leave tonight.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.913
We're not ready.
We've got less than 200 gallons.

36:03.497 --> 36:05.541
-And?
-And it's not enough.

36:05.624 --> 36:07.376
But it's enough to get away, right?
I mean…

36:07.876 --> 36:10.170
-we can just improvise the rest.
-Oh, yeah?

36:10.254 --> 36:13.382
You know who improvises? Your dad
improvises, and look where that got us.

36:13.465 --> 36:14.883
We have no choice.

36:14.967 --> 36:19.304
We're not getting out of here
any other way. He won't let us.

36:19.388 --> 36:21.181
It's now or never.

36:22.224 --> 36:23.517
We just need him to sleep.

36:24.017 --> 36:25.477
Oh, yeah, good luck with that.

36:25.978 --> 36:29.857
He sleeps with one eye open
like a goddamn dolphin.

36:36.405 --> 36:37.656
You can give him these.

36:44.079 --> 36:45.330
Where'd you even get these?

36:46.540 --> 36:48.041
-A guy.
-Yeah, what guy?

36:48.917 --> 36:51.253
-Adolfo.
-The boat kid?

36:51.336 --> 36:54.339
Jesus fucking Christ, Dina.
You don't even know him.

36:54.423 --> 36:56.592
He thinks they're for me.
He won't tell anyone.

37:00.512 --> 37:01.680
We can't do this.

37:01.763 --> 37:04.141
Mom, we never asked for this.

37:04.224 --> 37:06.185
I mean, we never even wanted it.

37:06.685 --> 37:08.896
This is his thing, not ours.

37:09.897 --> 37:14.985
And Charlie needs help.
Like, serious help.

37:15.068 --> 37:16.653
He can't stay here.

37:17.779 --> 37:18.989
None of us can.

37:20.949 --> 37:21.950
You're right.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.081
I'm gonna get us out of here.

37:28.165 --> 37:29.917
You deserve to have a life.

37:38.759 --> 37:41.011
Hey!

37:43.222 --> 37:45.098
Wait, it's gonna be better.

37:56.652 --> 37:57.653
Charlie.

38:39.570 --> 38:40.863
I told you.

38:40.946 --> 38:43.574
Charlie. Charlie!

38:57.963 --> 39:00.007
Hey. Did you guys see that?

39:02.885 --> 39:04.011
We're so proud of you both.

39:04.094 --> 39:06.013
We should do something
to thank your father.

39:06.096 --> 39:07.890
What, like a celebration or something?

39:07.973 --> 39:08.974
Yeah.

39:09.057 --> 39:11.894
What do you think? A family thing.

39:12.644 --> 39:13.645
Okay.

39:14.313 --> 39:16.398
Why don't you grab some drinks?
See if they have any.

39:16.481 --> 39:17.900
Yeah, let's go. Let's do it.

39:29.703 --> 39:32.289
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:32.372 --> 39:33.999
-It worked.
-Yeah.

39:34.499 --> 39:38.212
Now you can power your houses,
cool your refrigerators,

39:38.295 --> 39:39.296
whatever you want.

39:40.964 --> 39:43.383
So, now might be a good time
to talk about the trawler.

39:45.844 --> 39:46.970
What about it?

39:48.514 --> 39:49.723
We sold it.

39:52.684 --> 39:53.685
Are you serious?

39:54.311 --> 39:56.772
We needed the money.
Ridley's picking it up tomorrow.

39:58.273 --> 39:59.316
You don't need it.

39:59.816 --> 40:00.817
You're here now.

40:02.402 --> 40:03.403
Yeah.

40:03.487 --> 40:07.199
Anyways, if you need anything from it,
you should go get it tonight.

42:35.389 --> 42:37.266
-Hey.
-Hey, Dad.

42:37.933 --> 42:39.101
Here. Cheers.

42:41.854 --> 42:43.105
What's all this?

42:43.188 --> 42:44.565
Mescal.

42:46.066 --> 42:47.067
Oh, yeah?

42:47.818 --> 42:50.821
-How'd we get that?
-You got your son to thank for that.

42:54.533 --> 42:55.534
How?

42:56.326 --> 42:57.911
Just asked around.

42:57.995 --> 43:01.248
Traded with this dude named Alejandro.
He has, like, tattoos and all that stuff.

43:02.457 --> 43:03.542
Traded for what?

43:03.625 --> 43:06.670
Like, a week of kitchen work.

43:13.927 --> 43:15.888
-Cheers.
-Yeah, cheers.

43:25.856 --> 43:26.857
Come on outside.

43:27.774 --> 43:29.109
I wanna show you something.

43:32.279 --> 43:33.530
Come on.

43:36.325 --> 43:37.618
Come on, guys.

43:38.869 --> 43:39.870
Come on, Mom.

44:16.865 --> 44:17.991
I don't get it.

44:21.620 --> 44:22.913
Isela was gonna sell her.

44:26.124 --> 44:29.586
So-- Been together with us a long time.

44:34.174 --> 44:36.301
So, now she's gonna stay here with us.
