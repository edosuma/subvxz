00:07.557 --> 00:09.491
<i>T-minus 60 seconds!</i>

00:09.493 --> 00:11.560
Oh, it all comes
down to this!

00:11.562 --> 00:14.062
Oh, I've got
butterflies.

00:14.064 --> 00:15.446
Don't get soft on me,
Hofstadter.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.799
I will slap those glasses
right off your face.

00:19.202 --> 00:21.636
What's going on?

00:21.638 --> 00:24.256
Hey. We're about
to buy tickets for Comic-Con.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.841
Oh.

00:25.843 --> 00:27.309
T Minus 45 seconds!

00:27.311 --> 00:28.610
They sell out incredibly
fast, but as long

00:28.612 --> 00:30.478
as one of us gets in, we can buy passes...
Good Lord,

00:30.480 --> 00:32.720
this is not the time for
flirting! Keep it in your pants!

00:33.900 --> 00:36.801
It's a whole lot
of weird before coffee.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.688
T-minus 30 seconds!

00:39.690 --> 00:42.023
Oh, I have to go
to the bathroom so bad.

00:42.025 --> 00:43.975
Every year!
I told you, wear a diaper!

00:43.977 --> 00:46.161
And I told you
I get diaper rash!

00:46.163 --> 00:47.028
15 seconds!

00:47.030 --> 00:48.280
Oh, this is it!

00:48.282 --> 00:49.814
This is it!

00:49.816 --> 00:50.999

Uh, 15...
Great!

02:19.174 --> 02:20.390
...thousand, 211.

02:20.392 --> 02:22.609
Damn!
Oh!

02:22.611 --> 02:25.278
Oh, they only have Thursday
and Sunday passes left.

02:25.280 --> 02:25.885
Really?

02:25.910 --> 02:27.511
Oh, Thursday's gone.
Just Sunday left.

02:28.283 --> 02:29.649
Oh, Sunday's the worst!

02:29.651 --> 02:32.652
Everybody's leaving, most
of the good panels are over,

02:32.654 --> 02:36.456
and the only T-shirts they have
left are small and XXXXL.

02:38.793 --> 02:39.959
Sunday's gone.

02:39.961 --> 02:43.013
Not Sunday! I <i>love</i> Sunday!

02:44.215 --> 02:47.083
So that's it?
Everything's sold out?

02:47.085 --> 02:49.569
Yeah.

02:49.571 --> 02:52.789
I can't believe we're not going.

02:52.791 --> 02:55.375
It's okay.

02:55.377 --> 02:59.396
You know, there-there's always
WonderCon in Anaheim, you know?

02:59.398 --> 03:01.714
That-That's just as good.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.601
(voice breaking):
Excuse me.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.938
(crying)

03:11.008 --> 03:13.510
Oh, guys, this is really sad.

03:13.512 --> 03:17.597
And in a different way
than it was 20 minutes ago.

03:18.983 --> 03:23.503
I can't believe we wasted all
that time on our Hulk costumes.

03:23.505 --> 03:25.338
What? You were all going
as the Hulk?

03:25.340 --> 03:26.623
Not the <i>same</i> Hulk.

03:26.625 --> 03:30.110
Ferrigno, Bana,
Norton and Ruffalo.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.246
We would have been
the angry green belles

03:33.248 --> 03:35.849
of the masquerade ball.

03:35.851 --> 03:37.734
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

03:38.769 --> 03:42.155
And we're back
to the first kind of sad.

03:44.308 --> 03:49.195
Gentlemen, I have the solution
to our Comic-Con problem.

03:49.197 --> 03:50.947
We don't need them.

03:50.949 --> 03:53.083
I'm starting my own convention.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.821
Sheldon, just buy
scalped tickets with us.

03:57.823 --> 04:01.207
I told you. Buying scalped
tickets is against the rules.

04:01.209 --> 04:02.992
If you get caught,
you get

04:02.994 --> 04:04.944
banned from Comic-Con for life.

04:04.946 --> 04:06.463
<i>Life,</i> Leonard.

04:06.465 --> 04:08.715
You're gonna feel pretty silly
when we're 80 years old,

04:08.717 --> 04:10.633
and you have
to drive me down there

04:10.635 --> 04:12.785
and then wait in the car
for three days.

04:12.787 --> 04:14.387
Do what you want.

04:14.389 --> 04:15.889
We're getting
scalped tickets.

04:15.891 --> 04:18.507
Oh, I already found a guy online
who's willing to sell.

04:18.510 --> 04:21.010
How do you know
this isn't a sting operation

04:21.012 --> 04:24.130
set up by the Comic-Con police?

04:24.132 --> 04:25.565
The same way I know

04:25.567 --> 04:28.451
that the people
in the TV set can't see me.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.803
Sheldon,
just come with us.

04:30.805 --> 04:32.188
You're not gonna make
your own convention.

04:32.190 --> 04:33.740
You know, there was a time

04:33.742 --> 04:36.976
when Comic-Con didn't exist
at all until one lone dreamer

04:36.978 --> 04:39.412
with a unique vision
made it happen.

04:39.414 --> 04:42.999
And you mark my words--
I'm gonna rip that guy off.

04:45.369 --> 04:49.172
Yes, I'm starting
my own comic book convention,

04:49.174 --> 04:53.460
and I thought that your client,
Robert Downey Jr., would be

04:53.462 --> 04:56.463
perfect to appear
on our first panel.

04:56.465 --> 04:58.664
Oh, well, now,
why are you saying "no"?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.683
You haven't even
asked him yet.

05:00.685 --> 05:02.519
You know, excuse me,

05:02.521 --> 05:03.853
but I sat through <i>Iron Man 2.</i>

05:03.855 --> 05:06.389
I believe he owes me two hours
of his time.

05:07.558 --> 05:10.226
They hung up on me.

05:14.198 --> 05:16.282
Did you tell them th
you're holding your convention

05:16.284 --> 05:17.484
at a Marie Callender's,

05:17.486 --> 05:20.770
and that every panelist
gets a free slice of pie?

05:20.772 --> 05:23.656
I didn't even get to that part.

05:23.658 --> 05:25.375
Look, even your friend
Wil Wheaton thinks

05:25.377 --> 05:26.709
this is a
waste of time.

05:26.711 --> 05:28.127
Not true.

05:28.129 --> 05:29.963
Wil thinks
this is a great idea.

05:29.965 --> 05:32.916
He was just concerned that
he wasn't a big enough celebrity

05:32.918 --> 05:34.868
to headline
such an amazing event.

05:34.870 --> 05:39.022
Also, that's the same day
that he shampoos his beard.

05:39.024 --> 05:41.007
Sheldon, buddy,
I just don't think

05:41.009 --> 05:43.059
this is going
to come together for you.

05:43.061 --> 05:44.594
You don't know that.

05:44.596 --> 05:47.380
I still have plenty
of solid leads on this list.

05:47.382 --> 05:49.382
Good luck.
No, wait.

05:49.384 --> 05:51.884
I need you to call Stan Lee,
Leonard Nimoy

05:51.886 --> 05:54.621
and Bill Nye the Science Guy...

05:54.623 --> 05:57.106
'cause, legally,
I'm not allowed to.

05:57.108 --> 05:58.241
Oh, and, also,

05:58.243 --> 05:59.442
Carrie Fisher, you know,

05:59.444 --> 06:01.694
'cause I hear
she can be pretty nuts.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.348
I can't believe

06:05.350 --> 06:07.733
Leonard is spending hundreds
of dollars on scalped tickets.

06:07.735 --> 06:11.070
Last week, you spent that
on a little dress.

06:11.072 --> 06:13.206
Yeah, but those tickets
only get him into Comic-Con.

06:13.208 --> 06:16.226
That dress gets me
into anywhere I want.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.546
Those tickets
were pretty expensive.

06:19.548 --> 06:22.382
I had to give Howie an advance
on his allowance.

06:23.834 --> 06:27.353
Now he's never gonna
put his toys away.

06:27.355 --> 06:29.505
Why can't they do
something sensible

06:29.507 --> 06:32.308
like Sheldon and start their
own comic book convention?

06:33.244 --> 06:36.229
Also, who wants
to throw me out that window?

06:36.231 --> 06:39.765
Oh, while they're acting
like teenagers,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.100
we could do something grown-up.

06:41.102 --> 06:42.869
Oh. You mean like a museum?

06:42.871 --> 06:46.606
Yes, like a museum,
but anything else.

06:46.608 --> 06:48.675
Oh, I know.

06:48.677 --> 06:50.776
There's a nice hotel
not far from here

06:50.778 --> 06:52.078
where they do
afternoon tea.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.780
Ooh, afternoon tea--
how sophisticated of us.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.749
Oh, all right,
if we're gonna be fancy,

06:56.751 --> 06:58.751
I should probably put on
clean underwear.

06:58.753 --> 07:00.136
ee-da!

07:00.138 --> 07:01.938
Look who has
clean underwear.

07:01.940 --> 07:03.606
No, we're gonna stop at Target
on the way.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.045
Hey, since Sheldon's
not going to Comic-Con,

07:09.047 --> 07:11.431
maybe we could find a cool trio
to dress up as.

07:11.433 --> 07:14.651
What if we go as The Fantastic
Four, and just tell people

07:14.653 --> 07:18.237
that the Invisible Girl
is standing there with us.

07:18.239 --> 07:19.989
Oh, and I thought our days
of pretending

07:19.991 --> 07:22.158
to be with women
who don't exist were over.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.145
Gentlemen,
I am one step away

07:26.147 --> 07:29.432
from securing a huge guest
for my convention.

07:29.434 --> 07:30.767
Does that step
include chloroform

07:30.769 --> 07:33.252
and a roll of duct tape?

07:33.254 --> 07:35.004
I don't think that
will be necessary

07:35.006 --> 07:36.789
for Mr. James Earl Jones.

07:36.791 --> 07:37.824
You heard me.

07:37.826 --> 07:39.258
The voice of Darth Vader,

07:39.260 --> 07:40.826
the Lion King's dad,

07:40.828 --> 07:45.315
and FYI, the guy who says,
"This is CNN."

07:46.333 --> 07:49.235
Which also sounds
like Darth Vader.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.122
How are you gonna get
James Earl Jones?

07:53.124 --> 07:55.725
Simple.
Earlier today, he Tweeted

07:55.727 --> 07:57.110
that he's looking forward

07:57.112 --> 07:59.345
to going to his favorite
sushi restaurant for dinner.

07:59.347 --> 08:02.031
I Googled an interview
from four years ago

08:02.033 --> 08:05.401
which was conducted in
his favorite sushi restaurant.

08:05.403 --> 08:09.155
That's where he'll be, and
that's where I'm going, and...

08:09.157 --> 08:10.406
And that's where

08:10.408 --> 08:12.675
Darth Vader's gonna pour
soy sauce on your head.

08:14.278 --> 08:16.729
Sheldon, I don't care if you get
scalped tickets with us or not,

08:16.731 --> 08:19.799
but please don't be creepy
and go stalking this poor guy.

08:19.801 --> 08:21.134
You're gonna get in trouble.

08:21.136 --> 08:23.336
You're the ones
who are going to get in trouble.

08:23.338 --> 08:25.871
You're buying
non-transferable tickets.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.674
And from a stranger, no less.

08:27.676 --> 08:30.026
Not only can you get
banned from Comic-Con,

08:30.028 --> 08:32.761
if caught, you could be charged
with petty theft.

08:32.764 --> 08:35.431
You think about that while
I'm warning James Earl Jones

08:35.433 --> 08:38.351
out the danger of posting
his location on Twitter.

08:39.203 --> 08:40.820
He got lucky this time.

08:40.822 --> 08:43.823
There are some weirdoes
out there.

08:43.825 --> 08:45.658
(singing the "Imperial March):

08:45.660 --> 08:48.394

09:08.080 --> 09:10.832
Okay, great. Bye.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.284
Our friendly
neighborhood scalper

09:13.286 --> 09:14.586
says he's running late.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.088
Does he sound like a criminal?

09:17.090 --> 09:19.307
What do you mean?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.975
You know,
did he say things like,

09:20.977 --> 09:25.847
"Youse guys,"
or "Listen here, see?"

09:27.082 --> 09:29.067
Yes. He-He's late

09:29.069 --> 09:32.253
because he's on his way here
from 1940.

09:32.255 --> 09:34.138
I'm just saying.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.406
We don't know
who this guy is.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.659
What if he wants to steal
our money or our kidneys,

09:37.661 --> 09:40.144
or make a suit out
of our skins?

09:40.146 --> 09:43.932
Why would someone want to make
clothes out of your skin?

09:43.934 --> 09:45.283
I don't know.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.569
Maybe 'cause
dark doesn't show the stains?

09:48.404 --> 09:50.171
Well, now
you're making me wonder

09:50.173 --> 09:52.624
if we should have met him
at a neutral location.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.593
Why do you think I told him
to come to your place?

09:59.014 --> 10:01.299
(various indistinct
conversations)

10:03.469 --> 10:06.621
There sure are a lot
of little kids here.

10:06.623 --> 10:08.723
I can't believe we thought this
would makes us feel grown up.

10:08.725 --> 10:11.542
I can't believe the waiter
thought I was your daughter.

10:13.445 --> 10:17.198
Well, last time I got dressed up
and had tea was when I was five.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.668
Just me, my teddy bear,
Raggedy Ann and my hamster.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.236
That's cute.
It was.

10:22.238 --> 10:25.073
Till my hamster ate
all her babies.

10:26.926 --> 10:30.678
It got less cute really fast.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.297
Should we leave?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.798
Well, there's a bar
in the lobby.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.199
I could go for a drink.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.669
Aw. Drinking in the afternoon,
just like her mommy.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.253
(clicks tongue)

10:41.000 --> 10:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:50.633 --> 10:53.067
Let me guess.

10:53.069 --> 10:57.021
You like <i>Star Wars.</i>

10:59.358 --> 11:03.077
You know, I've been
in other movies.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.932
But you don't care
about those, do you?

11:15.574 --> 11:18.593
I have one thing to say
to people like you...

11:19.762 --> 11:22.764
I like <i>Star Wars,</i> too!

11:24.049 --> 11:26.000
Care to join me?

11:26.002 --> 11:28.436
Oh... thank you.

11:30.088 --> 11:32.056
My friend Leonard said
if I bothered you

11:32.058 --> 11:34.859
while you were eating, you'd
think I was a creepy stalker.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.144
Well...

11:36.146 --> 11:40.064
your friend Leonard sounds
like a real weenie.

11:42.151 --> 11:45.770
He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.559
Okay, so, I'm
on a Comic-Con message board,

11:51.561 --> 11:53.795
and there's a post from a guy

11:53.797 --> 11:56.647
where he says he got caught
using someone else's badge...

11:56.649 --> 11:59.650
and Sheldon was right-- he did
get charged with petty theft.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.870
Guys... if I go to jail
dressed as the Human Torch,

12:02.872 --> 12:05.239
that might send
the wrong message.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.276
(sighs)

12:08.278 --> 12:10.645
Maybe this isn't
a good idea.

12:10.647 --> 12:14.499
I can text the guy and tell him
we changed our minds.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.501
Do it.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.019
Okay.

12:18.021 --> 12:21.406
We're officially
not going to Comic-Con.

12:23.158 --> 12:25.643
Hold on.
We always do this.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.828
Do what?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.646
Chicken out.
We're-we're so afraid

12:28.648 --> 12:31.999
of getting into trouble that
we never do anything wrong.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.367
That's 'cause
we're the good guys.

12:33.369 --> 12:35.152
Even Batman breaks the rules.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.588
You know I struggle with Batman.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.992
I-I say, this one time,
instead of wimping out,

12:41.994 --> 12:43.945
let's be badasses!

12:43.947 --> 12:46.380
Okay, I'll be a badass--

12:46.382 --> 12:49.834
but only if you pinky-swear
to be one, too.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.553
Howard, you in on this?

12:52.555 --> 12:55.973
No need. I'm breaking rules
all the time.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.558
Name one.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.893
Last night.

12:58.895 --> 13:02.113
Drank my Pepto
straight out of the bottle.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.016
What about that little
cup they give you?

13:06.018 --> 13:07.819
(chuckles):
Yeah.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.321
What about it?

13:12.825 --> 13:14.575
A-Are you
impressed by that?

13:14.577 --> 13:16.894
A little.
Yeah, me, too.

13:19.465 --> 13:23.200
You know, when I first read the
script for <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>

13:23.202 --> 13:26.087
and Darth Vader told Luke
he was his father...

13:26.922 --> 13:28.840
...I thought for sure
he was lying.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.641
Me, too!

13:30.643 --> 13:32.593
But he wasn't, was he?

13:32.595 --> 13:34.312
He was <i>not!</i>

13:34.314 --> 13:37.148
How messed up was that?!

13:37.150 --> 13:39.734
So messed up.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.270
What do you say
let's go have some fun?

13:42.272 --> 13:43.354
My wife's
in New York,

13:43.356 --> 13:45.857
and I got a <i>Lion King</i>
residual check

13:45.859 --> 13:47.859
burning a hole in my pocket.

13:50.345 --> 13:53.314
So, afternoon tea
was a bust.

13:53.316 --> 13:55.283
On the bright side,
every six-year-old there

13:55.285 --> 13:58.452
was jealous of my tiara.

13:58.454 --> 14:02.123
Not gonna lie--
it felt good.

14:02.125 --> 14:03.574
Let me ask you a question:

14:03.576 --> 14:05.626
When did you guys
start feeling grown up?

14:05.628 --> 14:07.261
'Cause I am not sure I do.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.080
Honestly, I thought when
I got married I would,

14:10.082 --> 14:12.416
but I still kind of feel
like I'm pretending.

14:12.418 --> 14:15.970
It doesn't help that most of
my clothes come from Gap Kids.

14:17.239 --> 14:18.973
Okay, so I'm an adult,

14:18.975 --> 14:22.193
and the other day I saw
an old man slip and fall down,

14:22.195 --> 14:23.811
and I laughed.

14:23.813 --> 14:26.347
I mean, I laughed hard.

14:26.349 --> 14:27.648
Like-like,

14:27.650 --> 14:29.233
out loud.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.136
If he was conscious,
he would've heard me.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.121
Oh, my gosh.
I know.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.106
One of the tennis balls
came off his walker

14:36.108 --> 14:39.076
and bounced right off his head.
I mean... (laughing)

14:39.078 --> 14:42.296
I... I almost wet myself.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.918
I guess you had to be there.
(clears throat)

14:46.920 --> 14:48.302
I think I have
you both beat.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.754
Imagine trying to feel
like a grown-up

14:49.756 --> 14:51.339
when you've never
even been with a man.

14:51.341 --> 14:53.875
Okay, sex is not
what makes you a grown-up.

14:53.877 --> 14:58.128
Yeah. Or you'd be
the oldest one here.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.647
Really?

14:59.649 --> 15:02.967
Is that how you talk
to your mother?

15:06.071 --> 15:07.471
He just parked.
He's on his way up.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.139
Good. This is exciting.

15:09.141 --> 15:11.225
It is. I feel alive.
Yeah.

15:11.227 --> 15:13.277
What if we do get caught;
who cares?

15:13.279 --> 15:14.662
So we get banned from Comic-Con.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.581
Maybe slapped with a fine.
Oh, no.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.532
I'll be an astronaut
<i>and</i> a bad boy--

15:18.534 --> 15:21.369
how will women
keep their pants on?

15:21.371 --> 15:25.456
Uh, maybe it'll come up when
I apply for citizenship.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.893
Oh, crap, what if it comes up
when I apply for citizenship?

15:28.895 --> 15:31.345
I wonder if we'd have
to disclose something like this

15:31.347 --> 15:32.830
when we apply for grants.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.466
He's gonna be here any second--
what should we do?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.518
You guys are such babies.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.303
I'll handle this.

15:39.305 --> 15:42.390
(whispers): If he thinks we're not home,
he'll go away.

15:43.475 --> 15:44.892
(pounding on door)

15:44.894 --> 15:46.260
I thought you
were a badass.

15:46.262 --> 15:50.414
I lied about the Pepto--
I always use the little cup!

15:55.320 --> 15:59.323
Is it true, as a child,
you were a stutterer

15:59.325 --> 16:02.460
and were functionally
mute for eight years?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.078
It is true.
Oh.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.415
Is it true they
used scuba gear

16:07.417 --> 16:10.217
to create the sound of
Darth Vader breathing?

16:10.219 --> 16:12.453
They sure did.
Oh.

16:12.455 --> 16:16.557
Is it true that you
were premed in college

16:16.559 --> 16:18.709
and you almost
became a doctor?

16:18.711 --> 16:19.877
That's right.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.729
Oh, James!

16:21.731 --> 16:25.516
I could listen
to your stories all night.

16:26.568 --> 16:30.220
(imitating engine rumbling)

16:33.275 --> 16:37.161
I mean, really, what's
so great about being grown up?

16:37.163 --> 16:41.082
Well, for starters, we'd be
splitting this check three ways.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.618
I'm serious.
Who wants to do all that stuff?

16:44.620 --> 16:46.837
Have insurance, pay mortgages,

16:46.839 --> 16:50.675
leave one of those little notes
when you hit a parked car.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.627
I <i>told</i> you
it was Penny.

16:53.629 --> 16:54.962
Oh, come on, it wasn't me.

16:54.964 --> 16:57.048
Anyone could have knocked
your mirror off...

16:57.050 --> 16:59.350
or whatever happened.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.920
Maybe the guys
are right.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.638
I mean, we spent the whole
night trying to be mature,

17:05.641 --> 17:07.191
and it was kind of boring.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.477
I'm sure they're having
more fun than we are.

17:09.479 --> 17:11.444
(pounding on door)

17:11.446 --> 17:12.980
(quietly):
Oh, God, I could really use

17:12.982 --> 17:15.648
exactly two tablespoons
of Pepto right now.

17:15.651 --> 17:17.568
(pounding continues)

17:25.961 --> 17:27.994
Hey, Los Angeles!

17:27.997 --> 17:31.415
I'm on a Ferris wheel
with Darth Vader!

17:31.417 --> 17:34.719
And he's nicer than you think!

17:35.721 --> 17:37.755
I am!

17:41.143 --> 17:44.962
♪ In the jungle, the mighty jungle ♪
♪ <i>Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh...</i> ♪

17:44.964 --> 17:47.765
(high-pitched):
♪ The lion sleeps tonight

17:47.767 --> 17:48.933
Bring it home, Mufasa.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.135

17:58.927 --> 18:00.477
(whispers): I don't understand
what we're doing.

18:00.479 --> 18:01.612
Shh.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.664
Whose house is that?

18:03.666 --> 18:05.149
(quietly):
Carrie Fisher.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.368
And she's a little crazy,

18:07.370 --> 18:08.819
so get ready to run.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.487
(Rings doorbell)

18:22.451 --> 18:26.270
It's not funny anymore, James!

18:27.589 --> 18:29.957
JONES (in distance):
Then why am I laughing!

18:29.959 --> 18:32.643
(Jones guffawing)

18:38.200 --> 18:40.768
Ah, Sheldon, this
is the perfect end

18:40.770 --> 18:42.903
to a perfect night.

18:43.738 --> 18:45.856
Okay.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.291
Yeah, but I think

18:47.293 --> 18:50.578
it could have ended
with the karaoke.

18:50.580 --> 18:54.432
What were you trying to ask me
at the strip club?

18:54.434 --> 18:55.866
Oh.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.553
How much does it cost
to get them <i>off</i> my lap?

18:59.555 --> 19:02.106
No. Something
about a convention.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.608
Oh, right!
Well...

19:04.610 --> 19:07.645
my friends and I couldn't
get into Comic-Con this year,

19:07.647 --> 19:10.397
and I was trying to start
my own convention,

19:10.399 --> 19:11.816
and I was going

19:11.818 --> 19:14.351
to ask if you
would be a panelist.

19:14.353 --> 19:17.671
Why don't you and your friends
come to Comic-Con with me?

19:17.673 --> 19:19.623
Really?
Of course.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.775
And San Diego is
right across the border

19:21.777 --> 19:24.078
from my favorite city on Earth,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.730
Tijuana...

19:27.799 --> 19:31.452
...where I'm taking you
every night!

19:32.287 --> 19:35.022
Ay-yi-yi.

19:35.024 --> 19:38.792
Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.

19:46.997 --> 19:49.666
So, Beau Bridges
is on my shoulders,

19:49.668 --> 19:53.436
and Jeff Bridges is
on Marlon Brando's shoulders,

19:53.438 --> 19:57.040
and remember, we do not have
permission to be in the pool--

19:57.042 --> 19:59.325
Hey! Sheldon, wake up!

19:59.327 --> 20:00.493
And...

20:00.495 --> 20:03.129
Angie Dickinson is
about to sic the dogs on us,

20:03.131 --> 20:05.632
and I go under the water and
Marlon goes under the water,

20:05.634 --> 20:07.600
and the water raises
about two feet

20:07.602 --> 20:09.385
and sloshes all
over her patio,

20:09.387 --> 20:11.348
and the dogs freak out
and run like hell, and

20:11.373 --> 20:12.856
then we run like hell...

20:12.857 --> 20:14.674
(laughs):
Oh, boy!

20:14.676 --> 20:17.677
That was a lot of fun.

20:17.679 --> 20:20.113
Uh... who's Angie Dickinson?
