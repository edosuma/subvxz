I was just sneaking away

so I could send you this.

02:12.291 --> 02:15.208
But I am gonna pee after,
'cause I do have to go

02:15.291 --> 02:18.000

too many breaks.

on the house tonight

02:33.083 --> 02:34.667

02:34.750 --> 02:36.125

my classy game.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.542
You know, books,

02:59.625 --> 03:01.125

03:02.709 --> 03:04.041

03:04.125 --> 03:05.542
The last time I had
a real night off,

03:05.625 --> 03:07.166
I had a date with a man.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.667
Well, a girls' night
sounds like fun.

03:09.750 --> 03:12.583
It's been a long time
since I've rocked the Casbah.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.041
We can tell.
(laughs)

03:14.125 --> 03:15.417
Well, Jimmy, unlike you,

03:15.500 --> 03:17.125
I don't need to go out
every night

03:17.208 --> 03:19.333
and seek validation
from the opposite sex.

03:19.417 --> 03:20.375
That's not true.

03:20.458 --> 03:22.625
No, it's not an insult,
it's a fact.

03:22.709 --> 03:24.834
You're addicted
to female validation.

03:24.917 --> 03:27.041
Everything about you
is aimed at getting it.

03:27.125 --> 03:28.875
Like what?
You car,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.250
your clothes, the way you only
approach women from the right

03:31.333 --> 03:33.083
because that's
your good side.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.083
That one French poem
you memorized.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.291
<i>"Chanson d'Après-midi"</i>
is a classic

03:36.375 --> 03:37.792
that everyone should know.

03:37.875 --> 03:38.875
Ooh, fancy.

03:38.959 --> 03:40.083
Right.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.834
Then, of course,
once you get the validation

03:41.917 --> 03:43.875
that you're after, you bail
before it gets too serious,

03:43.959 --> 03:45.709
and then you're on
to the next girl.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.792
That's not true.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.083
True.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.083
There's a pretty woman
behind you

03:49.166 --> 03:50.083
that keeps looking over here.

03:50.166 --> 03:51.166
I wonder what her deal is.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.875
I'm not falling for that.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.166
Look at those legs.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.208
All right, I am going to look

03:57.291 --> 03:59.375
because I don't want to be rude
in case you're not tricking me,

03:59.458 --> 04:02.083
which I knew the whole time
you were tricking me.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.333
You turned with your right side.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.917
EDIE:
Yup.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.792
Uh, Edie, just stay out of this.

04:06.875 --> 04:07.792
(Jimmy stammers)

04:07.875 --> 04:10.125
Do I enjoy the company
of women? Yes.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.291
Do they enjoy the company
of me?

04:11.375 --> 04:13.125
I don't know, I don't know.

04:13.208 --> 04:15.125
But that doesn't mean
I seek validation

04:15.208 --> 04:17.375
or that I... that I have
some sort of addiction.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.500
I'm going out tomorrow night
to a place

04:19.583 --> 04:21.125
that I can pretty much guarantee
is women-free.

04:21.208 --> 04:23.375
Guys, uh, count me in
for whatever stupid thing

04:23.458 --> 04:24.500
you're doing tomorrow night.

04:24.583 --> 04:25.583
We're actually still deciding.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.041
It's between a Korean spa,

04:27.125 --> 04:28.583
and a museum of curiosities.

04:28.667 --> 04:29.834
If we shoot the moon,
we can do both.

04:29.917 --> 04:31.041
Damn it.

04:35.917 --> 04:36.959
See, a beautiful woman
just walked by,

04:37.041 --> 04:38.792
and I didn't even notice her.

04:40.709 --> 04:41.959
(Vanessa laughs)

04:42.041 --> 04:43.792
Isn't this place perfect?

04:43.875 --> 04:46.125
Yeah, I Googled "rich people,
bar,<i> Downton Abbey" </i>

04:46.208 --> 04:48.125
so we can class things up.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.917
Oh, good evening, "gar-kon."

04:50.000 --> 04:51.166
One wine cooler, please.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.792
We don't have those here.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.250
Oh, out of stock. I see.

04:54.333 --> 04:57.166
Then I'll simply
purchase a white wine.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.166
What varietal?
Grape.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.542
Okay.

05:00.625 --> 05:03.667
I am not seeing a lot of talent
out tonight.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.166
It's never a good sign

05:05.250 --> 05:06.959
when you can beat up
every guy in the bar.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.166
I thought that
was your type.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.709
They all look like your ex.

05:09.792 --> 05:12.959
Well, uh, Bruce was nice,
but he didn't really...

05:13.041 --> 05:14.291
Make you horny. Got it.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.458
Oh, sorry I'm late.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.917
Jimmy made me go buy him
a new spa robe.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.458
Anyway, let's get some food.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.125
What do you guys want?

05:22.208 --> 05:23.542
What am I gonna get?

05:23.625 --> 05:25.333
Don't say hot dogs--
I had three for lunch.

05:25.417 --> 05:27.125
Ooh, never had this.

05:27.208 --> 05:30.083
Brick oven-roasted
artichoke sounds fancy.

05:30.166 --> 05:31.250
Yeah, get that.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.083
(phone rings)

05:33.166 --> 05:35.709
God. Sorry.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.458
Hello, Jimmy.

05:37.542 --> 05:40.125
Yes, Koreatown is safe now.

05:40.208 --> 05:43.000
The riots ended 24 years ago.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.208
(chuckles)

05:46.291 --> 05:48.542
Can I get some
sugar for this?

05:48.625 --> 05:49.959
Sugar?

05:50.041 --> 05:51.291
Just get her some sugar.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.917
This is awesome.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.083
(others laughing)

05:58.166 --> 06:00.375
JIMMY:
Wait a minute, I thought you
said we were going to a spa.

06:00.458 --> 06:01.959
RAVI:
This is a spa:

06:02.041 --> 06:03.417
the cheapest Korean
spa in all of L.A.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.750
All you can eat, drink
and schvitz for ten bucks.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.041
Great, just what I wanted
to do tonight,

06:07.125 --> 06:08.625
sweat into a bowl
of "bimbimbap."

06:08.709 --> 06:11.166
Mm, yeah, I'm going to
"bimbimbap" my face off.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.417
Uh, and fill up on rice?

06:12.500 --> 06:15.250
First time at a
bargain Korean spa?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.625
Please. All right,
you're talking to the guy

06:16.709 --> 06:18.250
that brought an extra Tupperware
just to fill up

06:18.333 --> 06:20.208
with the complimentary lotion.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.834
Oh, were you just gonna use the
free lotion while you're here?

06:22.917 --> 06:25.458
Are you implying that you can
get more bang for your buck

06:25.542 --> 06:27.500
at this spa
than I can, bro?

06:27.583 --> 06:30.083
I'm not implying it.
I'm straight-up saying it.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.500
Oh, it is on.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.875
Bring it.

06:33.959 --> 06:36.291
(sighs)
Psyched for the sauna, Dad?

06:36.375 --> 06:38.250
Oh, this is perfect. It's
got everything I'd want.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.667
Dirty towels, fungus...

06:39.750 --> 06:41.709
all my employees'
penises. Ew.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.291
(phone chimes)

06:50.166 --> 06:52.250
Come on, let's go!
No more phone!

06:52.333 --> 06:54.208
Come sauna with us.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.375
Let's go, Grandpa.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.917
The sauna, the sauna.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.750
Now I finally understand
why jocks beat up nerds.

06:59.834 --> 07:01.375
Yay! Yeah!

07:05.000 --> 07:08.542
Yup, been a Red Sox fan

07:08.625 --> 07:10.166
Get the hell out of here!

07:10.250 --> 07:11.875
I went to Hank's
Bartending School, too!

07:11.959 --> 07:13.166
Did you hear they got robbed?

07:13.250 --> 07:14.792
I meant Harvard Business School.

07:14.875 --> 07:15.917
Oh.

07:16.000 --> 07:16.917
(giggles, sighs)

07:17.000 --> 07:18.834
Ah...

07:18.917 --> 07:20.208
(laughs)
Looks yummy.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.667
(chuckles)

07:27.208 --> 07:29.542
I'll just...
I'm gonna let it cool.

07:29.625 --> 07:30.166
Yeah.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.166
Hot. Steam.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.333
No, seriously,
this tour was unbelievable.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.834
They said we'd be lucky
to see one whale.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.375
We saw two whales.

07:40.458 --> 07:44.417
Wow. That story really lives up
to the hype.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.917
Thanks.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.250
I have to say,
I was hoping you'd talk to me.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.583
I was figuring out
if you were gay.

07:51.667 --> 07:52.959
(phone chimes)

07:53.041 --> 07:55.667
This is my boss.
Don't go anywhere.

07:59.875 --> 08:02.333
Hey. I got something going
with this Harvard guy...

08:02.417 --> 08:04.667
Mm-hmm.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.959
What? Uh, just peel back
the leaves

08:07.041 --> 08:08.959
and scrape off the stuff
at the end with your teeth.

08:09.041 --> 08:10.667
The best part is the heart
in the center.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.959
Got it. Wait, it has a heart?

08:13.041 --> 08:15.375
(whimpers)

08:15.458 --> 08:17.375
I don't know how much more
of this place I can take.

08:17.458 --> 08:18.917
I've spoken
to three different accountants

08:19.000 --> 08:20.583
about whale watching.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.625
Ugh.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.083
Oh. Maybe I spoke
too soon.

08:27.792 --> 08:30.000
Pardon my reach.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.792
Hi, I'm Luke.

08:31.875 --> 08:34.208
Oh. Sara.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.000
Ever been on a whale watch?

08:36.083 --> 08:37.542
Good. Buy me a drink.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.667
Love to. Bartender.

08:41.041 --> 08:43.208
Gerald, if I respond
to a flirty text,

08:43.291 --> 08:45.792
that doesn't mean I'm addicted
to female attention, does it?

08:45.875 --> 08:47.583
No, not by itself,
but, you know,

08:47.667 --> 08:50.000
if you take into account
your years of womanizing,

08:50.083 --> 08:51.709
then... yeah.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.500
Victor...

08:53.583 --> 08:55.500
I'm-I'm just trying
to find true love.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.208
Why is that so
controversial?

08:57.291 --> 08:59.625
I guess because
if a man of your stature wanted

08:59.709 --> 09:02.041
to find true love,
he'd have found it by now.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.041
Whew! Round three, baby.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.041
There's at least ten dollars
of free kimchi right here.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.333
No, no, no, no. What about all
this, huh? What about all this?

09:09.417 --> 09:12.041
50 bucks worth of soju,
$12 worth of baked eggs.

09:12.125 --> 09:13.834
They cook 'em
right in the sauna.

09:13.917 --> 09:17.041
a little easy on this food.
It's looking a little... wet.

09:17.125 --> 09:19.250
The buffet table gets
a little splash from the shower.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.250
That's a meal and a beverage
all in one.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.500
Yep.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.709
Come on, Dad, treat yourself.
A little egg action.

09:25.792 --> 09:27.166
Uh-uh.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.291
I thought
this was an all-male spa.

09:35.917 --> 09:38.500
Boy, she cuts right
to the chase, doesn't she?

09:38.583 --> 09:40.834
(chuckles)
I wonder what her story is.

09:40.917 --> 09:42.834
From the looks of it,
she washes

09:42.917 --> 09:44.458
the towels
and then folds them.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.000
Fascinating.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.125
(indistinct chatter)

09:51.208 --> 09:53.083
Would you like
to try our artichoke?

09:53.166 --> 09:56.917
Oh. Yeah. I love 'em.
(giggles)

09:57.000 --> 09:58.166
(chuckles)

09:58.250 --> 10:00.917
Those are the discarded pieces.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.333
(spitting)

10:02.417 --> 10:03.959
Have a nice night.

10:05.583 --> 10:09.000
Chipped my tooth--
Fishbone concert.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.917
(laughs) I broke my arm
at a Better Than Ezra concert.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.083
Cooler injury. Lamer band.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.333
(both chuckle)

10:16.417 --> 10:18.125
It's really nice to talk to you.
I have to be honest,

10:18.208 --> 10:19.709
I haven't been out in a while.

10:19.792 --> 10:20.792
Oof. I totally get it.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.375
I'm so bad at this stuff.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.875
No. You're doing pretty good.

10:25.667 --> 10:26.417
How am I doing?

10:28.083 --> 10:31.125
You are doing okay.

10:31.208 --> 10:34.125
I don't want to kill the mood,
but I really hate my ears.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.417
Could you...

10:35.500 --> 10:36.333
Yep.

10:36.417 --> 10:38.125
Thank you.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.917
I got to say,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.542
I kind of miss the ear.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.000
All right, you can put it back.

10:46.083 --> 10:49.166
Yeah! Scored some
of these sick water shoes

10:49.250 --> 10:51.375
someone left in the shower.
These babies are worth

10:51.458 --> 10:54.000
at least 20 bucks. What's up?

10:54.083 --> 10:56.000
Please. I just got
a free full-body massage

10:56.083 --> 10:59.125
from Magic Fingers over there.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.083
Yeah, I don't think
Magic Fingers works here.

11:02.875 --> 11:06.208
(sighs)
But he was so thorough.

11:10.917 --> 11:12.709
Oh. Allow me.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.291
(nervous chuckle)

11:14.375 --> 11:15.417
There we go.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.166
Here it is.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.166
(both laugh)

11:19.250 --> 11:22.166
They don't teach me how to fold
towels at the restaurant I own.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.166
I own a restaurant.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.166
(both chuckle)

11:26.250 --> 11:28.166
You have such a great sense
of humor. What's your name?

11:28.250 --> 11:29.166
(accented):
Uh, towel?

11:29.250 --> 11:29.917
Tuh-owry?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.333
Uh, towel?

11:31.417 --> 11:33.333
Oh, you don't speak English.
You were just...

11:33.417 --> 11:36.917
laughing at my comedic rhythms.
That's... I get that a lot.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.625
(speaks Korean)

11:38.709 --> 11:41.291
Let me text my
assistant Annelise.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.834
(both laugh)

11:42.917 --> 11:44.250
Oh, shoot.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.458
Ugh. Sorry this keeps...

11:49.542 --> 11:51.542
happening. Crap.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.208
(both laugh)

11:53.291 --> 11:57.208
Yes. Big Sur is amazing.
I get up there whenever I can.

11:57.291 --> 11:59.583
Well, the next time you ride
up there on your motorcycle,

11:59.667 --> 12:03.000
if you want someone to split
the gas money with...

12:03.083 --> 12:04.625
Oh.

12:04.709 --> 12:05.625
(inhales)

12:05.709 --> 12:07.208
Um, I'm sorry.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.875
I must have given you
the wrong impression.

12:08.959 --> 12:11.000
I'm actually married.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.083
Yeah, my wife and I have this
agreement where we can go out

12:13.166 --> 12:15.458
and flirt as much as we want,
just as long as it doesn't lead

12:15.542 --> 12:17.000
to anything physical,
you know?

12:17.083 --> 12:18.792
We call it Catch and Release.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.625
My wife's pretty cool.

12:20.709 --> 12:21.792
What?!

12:21.875 --> 12:23.750
What?! That's all
an artichoke is?

12:23.834 --> 12:25.625
This is not worth it.

12:25.709 --> 12:28.625
Oh, this heart thing
better be good.

12:28.709 --> 12:31.667
Okay. Okay.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.291
(reading Korean slowly)

12:36.583 --> 12:39.250
Hangshin lee? What did you say?
I can't understand you.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.583
Are you so obsessed with female
validation that you are flirting

12:41.667 --> 12:43.709
with someone who doesn't
even speak your language?

12:43.792 --> 12:45.709
It doesn't matter that
she doesn't speak my language.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.208
She speaks me.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.458
(speaks Korean)

12:48.542 --> 12:50.875
Chun... Hold on. Can you say it,
please, to her?

12:50.959 --> 12:53.250
(speaks Korean)

12:53.333 --> 12:55.917
Thank you. What is it?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.250
Okay, I translated it.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.709
It means, "I have a husband."

12:58.792 --> 13:00.583
I see.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.291
Could've fooled me, you flirt.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.792
And I have a life. Bye, Jimmy.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.875
Mmm... Mmm...

13:12.000 --> 13:13.792
Nope.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.709
Hey, it's Jimmy.

13:16.792 --> 13:18.041
Yeah, it turns out
I can go to the play now.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.291
Any chance it starts
at 11:00 p.m.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.625
and is near Koreatown?

13:20.709 --> 13:22.166
Hey, it's Jimmy.
You still want to get dinner?

13:22.250 --> 13:23.959
No? Good night.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.291
Hey, well, now that you're up,
you want to go to dinner?

13:26.375 --> 13:27.750
No? Hello?

13:27.834 --> 13:30.792
Hey, any chance
you're free tonight?

13:30.875 --> 13:32.375
You can get free?

13:32.458 --> 13:34.959
Perfect.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.375
Oh, uh, this isn't our bill.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.959
We-we paid the ten dollars
on the way in.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.333
Oh, this is for your
alcohol and food.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.291
You eat like a giant monster.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.792
Wait. Isn't it
all you can eat and drink?

13:43.875 --> 13:45.500
New owner. The old owner
went bankrupt.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.291
That whole all-you-can-eat thing
was a really bad business model.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.959
Thanks.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.709
But...

13:51.792 --> 13:53.291
I can't afford that.
No!

13:53.375 --> 13:54.542
Wh-Why did you make
me eat all those eggs?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.834
I hate eggs.
I hate kimchi.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.709
I don't even like competing!
I just like value!

13:58.792 --> 14:00.542
Come on, you egg eaters,
let's wrap this up.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.417
We're gonna go meet some girls
at a karaoke bar. Come on!

14:02.500 --> 14:04.333
It just keeps
getting worse.

14:04.417 --> 14:06.417
How much does that cost?

14:07.375 --> 14:09.875
(singer sustaining note)

14:09.959 --> 14:12.291
(song ends)

14:12.375 --> 14:15.083
Jimmers!
(screams and laughs)

14:15.166 --> 14:16.458
GERALD:
Priya?

14:16.542 --> 14:18.834
I knew that bathroom video
would get you, you perv!

14:18.917 --> 14:20.083
You guys remember
Priya, right?

14:20.166 --> 14:21.250
Hey.
Hi.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.458
Mm-hmm. Hey, losers.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.083
You want to go sing?
Sure.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.166
Okay, come on.

14:27.458 --> 14:28.792
(clears throat)
Uh, this is a Korean song

14:28.875 --> 14:30.458
that describes how
I'm feeling right now.

14:30.542 --> 14:32.667
It's called "The Penniless
Beggar of Gwangju."

14:32.750 --> 14:35.083
(upbeat tune plays)

14:35.166 --> 14:37.583
(singing in Korean)

14:39.959 --> 14:43.000
I can't believe
you texted me, stalker.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.709
Yeah, I stalked you.

14:44.792 --> 14:48.500
Priya, how long are we
staying here? These guys suck.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.875
Oh, my God,
get over yourself, Tory.

14:50.959 --> 14:53.083
Right before you texted,
these guys

14:53.166 --> 14:54.583
invited us to a secret
Rihanna show.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.667
but I said we can do that
any time. Anyway,

14:57.750 --> 14:59.166
how was London, England?
I can't believe

14:59.250 --> 15:00.500
you've been living there
this whole time.

15:00.583 --> 15:01.750
Priya, Priya...

15:01.834 --> 15:03.291
Aah!

15:03.375 --> 15:05.208
Isn't she a little bit
of terrific?

15:05.291 --> 15:06.709
Seriously, Priya?

15:06.792 --> 15:08.500
You even need
validation from her?

15:08.583 --> 15:10.500
You've literally
hit rock bottom.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.500
I know you think I have some
sort of addiction towards women,

15:12.583 --> 15:14.333
but that's not
what this is about.

15:14.417 --> 15:16.500
I mean, when I met her I sort of
dismissed her too quickly.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.417
That is immature.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.125
What I'm doing now shows growth.

15:20.208 --> 15:22.166
It's not all about you, Tory.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.834
Ow.

15:23.917 --> 15:27.250
Sweetie, let's
sing something together later.

15:27.333 --> 15:30.041
Something classic.
Do you like here Wiz Khalifa?

15:30.125 --> 15:33.417
Well, I...
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.542
And they can flirt as long as
it doesn't lead to anything?

15:36.625 --> 15:38.041
What's crazy is a guy
who sells a dime of pot

15:38.125 --> 15:41.542
is behind bars
while this nutjob roams free.

15:41.625 --> 15:42.875
You don't do time for a dime.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.458
But I know
what you're talking about.

15:44.542 --> 15:45.542
What a jerk.

15:45.625 --> 15:46.834
Want to know how to
get back at him?

15:46.917 --> 15:48.125
help me find
this blonde.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.542
Hey.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.291
Just because you're unhappy
with your sexless marriage

15:54.375 --> 15:55.917
doesn't mean you can
flaunt your chiseled chin

15:56.000 --> 15:57.500
and get my friend all horned up.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.166
Yeah.
I'm all horned up.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.959
Whoa, hey, come on.
It was just harmless flirting.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.583
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

16:03.667 --> 16:04.625
I showed you my ear.

16:04.709 --> 16:05.667
Yeah.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.917
And artichokes are dumb.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.917
Sure, the heart is delicious,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.250
but the leaves
are a bitch, so...

16:12.333 --> 16:14.583
Yeah.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.083
has anyone seen a tall,
blonde lesbian,

16:17.166 --> 16:18.583
blue top...

16:18.667 --> 16:20.083
Hello?

16:20.166 --> 16:21.542
Yes, Jimmy.

16:21.625 --> 16:22.834
We should get out of here.

16:24.709 --> 16:26.834
(sighs)
You look terrible.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.583
I feel terrible, too.

16:28.667 --> 16:31.291
I think it was those sauna
eggs-- I ate three of them.

16:31.375 --> 16:34.625
Oh, God, we just spent
so much money on food poisoning.

16:34.709 --> 16:37.625
Wait...
the spa gave us food poisoning.

16:37.709 --> 16:39.291
Now we can get our money back.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.500
You want to go puke
and call 'em?

16:40.583 --> 16:43.041
Oh, best night ever.

16:44.542 --> 16:46.625
BT-dub, thank you
for saving my night.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.500
I've been out with just girls
for, like, three hours,

16:48.583 --> 16:50.458
and it's like,
what's even the point?

16:50.542 --> 16:52.000
But you can still have fun
with your girlfriends, right?

16:52.083 --> 16:54.417
It's not like you need
male validation.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.500
I didn't get a boob job
for my girlfriends, Jimmy.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.375
I don't squeeze myself into
this for my girlfriends.

16:59.458 --> 17:01.625
I don't wear this much
makeup for my girlfriends.

17:01.709 --> 17:04.709
Actually, can we switch sides?
Because this is my good side.

17:06.709 --> 17:07.834
Oh, my God.

17:07.917 --> 17:09.375
What, you don't think it is?

17:09.458 --> 17:11.166
No... (sighs)

17:11.250 --> 17:12.458
Priya, this
isn't gonna work out.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.250
It... it's not you, it's just...

17:14.333 --> 17:15.667
London?

17:15.750 --> 17:17.625
But why... When are
you going back?

17:17.709 --> 17:19.625
(sighs) Jimmy, uh,
our timing is so off.

17:19.709 --> 17:21.875
I feel like one day we're gonna
see each other in Belgium,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.667
and you're gonna
be like, "Priya?"

17:23.750 --> 17:26.500
And I'm gonna be like, "Jimmy?"
Only I'm gonna have a baby then.

17:28.542 --> 17:30.458
I just hit rock-bottom.

17:30.542 --> 17:31.625
(sighs heavily)

17:36.875 --> 17:38.583
SARA:
This is nice.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.875
No guys to play their sick
head games with us.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.875
VANESSA: And I know
how to eat everything here.

17:42.959 --> 17:44.750
And you know
what else?

17:44.834 --> 17:47.542
No more Jimmy for tonight.

17:47.625 --> 17:48.542
Off.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.083
(laughs)

17:50.166 --> 17:52.792
I need something to drink
and something to punch.

17:52.875 --> 17:56.000
You know, they're going
to redo the upholstery.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.625
Really?

17:58.709 --> 18:00.542
Oh, no,
I got my own.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.750
(grunts)
Let's go.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.458
Stop. Calling. Me.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.625
Why don't you come in at
6:00 a.m. in the morning?

18:07.709 --> 18:08.959
Always calling...

18:09.041 --> 18:11.125
Rough night, angels?

18:11.208 --> 18:13.792
Damn it, you're
everywhere.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.333
I just came here for
a little peace and quiet.

18:15.417 --> 18:18.333
Oh, and actually that's
the<i> new </i>upholstery.

18:18.417 --> 18:21.542
Uh, they finished early;
I tried to text you, but...

18:23.959 --> 18:25.959
(grunting)

18:28.959 --> 18:30.458
(sighs)
Okay.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.750
No, but he said
we can come back

18:43.834 --> 18:46.083
and sweat out the food
poisoning anytime.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.083
For free?

18:47.166 --> 18:48.083
Half off.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.583
Best night ever.

18:49.667 --> 18:52.959
(moaning sensually)

18:53.041 --> 18:54.583
They're not watching.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.959
They're not watching.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.959
They're not wa...

18:58.041 --> 18:59.375
Ew, they're not... Ew!

18:59.458 --> 19:02.041

19:02.125 --> 19:03.250
We're not watching.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.792
Not watching.
Do it again.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.792
Okay, here we go.
All right.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.917
Come on,
come on.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.166
Check it out.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.166
We fixed the booth.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.709
You can barely
even tell.

19:12.792 --> 19:14.959
You can sort of tell.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.291
You can take it
out of my paycheck.

19:16.375 --> 19:18.083
Eh, you work hard.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.959
You earn the right to destroy
a booth once in a while.

19:21.041 --> 19:22.959
Hey, I helped
fix it too!

19:23.041 --> 19:24.959
What do I get?

19:25.041 --> 19:27.917
He really used the term
"catch and release"?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.500
What a tool.
Yeah.

19:29.583 --> 19:31.291
What are we making?
Whatever.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.792
Only food I've been around
tonight is shower kimchi.

19:33.875 --> 19:36.000
Ugh.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.083
Sorry you had
a crappy night.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.083
Makes you feel any better,
you were right about me.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.000
I love women too much.

19:42.083 --> 19:46.000
Or maybe you rely on woman after
woman to make you feel special

19:46.083 --> 19:48.083
because deep down you're
afraid you aren't.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.000
Or I want to find
the right woman,

19:50.083 --> 19:51.500
and I don't care
how long it takes.

19:51.583 --> 19:54.000
Or you're using
that as an excuse.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.291
You're not looking
for the right woman.

19:55.375 --> 19:56.750
That level of intimacy means

19:56.834 --> 19:58.000
that you could get hurt.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.000
Or...

20:00.083 --> 20:02.000
Can't think of any more.

20:02.083 --> 20:06.000
Jimmy, you've been running
around like this for 25 years.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.917
What's your endgame, man?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.875
Says the 46-year-old woman who's
still attracted to bad boys.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.166
Ugh.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.166
Yeah, well, that's always
been my weakness.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.166
It's how<i> you </i>got
lucky 25 years ago.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.667
It's how<i> I </i>got lucky?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.834
(chuckling):
Yeah.
Yeah.

20:19.917 --> 20:23.041
Ugh, I guess at some point
we're gonna need to grow up.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.834
Too hard.

20:24.917 --> 20:26.834
Hey, I know, why don't
we have a backup plan?

20:26.917 --> 20:29.834
(scoffs) Okay, shoot.

20:29.917 --> 20:31.875
where we say that if we're not
married by the time we're 60...

20:31.959 --> 20:33.417
Let's make it 65 to be safe.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.041
Okay, if we're
not married by 70,

20:35.125 --> 20:36.041
then we'll get married.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.291
Yeah, okay. Why not?

20:44.125 --> 20:46.083
Oh.
will you marry me?

20:46.166 --> 20:48.083
Yes.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.166
A thousand times yes.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.375
Maybe we should say
at 75, just in case.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.333
You think? Why don't we,
why don't we just make it 80?

20:56.417 --> 20:57.875
80! Yes!

20:57.959 --> 20:59.875
Women in my family tend
to die in their 60s,

20:59.959 --> 21:01.083
