01:17.161 --> 01:18.953
Hey.
- Yo, yo.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.371
- Yo.
- Hey, where you been?

01:20.456 --> 01:23.166
Only on the best 24-hour date of my life.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.627
- So she wasn't overhyped?
- Not at all. In fact, I've got something

01:26.712 --> 01:28.838
- to tell you guys.
- No, we've got something to tell you first.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.715
That's gotta wait. This is bigger.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.341
I don't know about that, bro.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.051
I'm telling you, this is bigger.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.803
What is it?

01:36.472 --> 01:37.847
I think I'm getting married.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.767
- What?
- Come on, Vince.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.978
I'm serious.
I'm absolutely in love with this woman.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.938
What? Was the sex that good?

01:46.023 --> 01:47.940
Well, yeah, but that's not it.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.984
It's that or you're back on drugs.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.569
I'm clearer than I've ever been.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.279
Well, did you drug her?

01:53.363 --> 01:58.326
No. Guys, I tried telling you
the moment I met her, this is it.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.077
I thought you guys helped me
'cause you believed.

02:00.162 --> 02:03.831
We believe, Vince. It's just taping
your exes' testimonies to marriage

02:03.916 --> 02:06.459
is a pretty big leap.
We need a little time to adjust.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.419
No time. We're going to Paris tonight
and I want you all at the ceremony.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.964
Are you sure you didn't take any drugs, bro?

02:12.049 --> 02:14.801
I'm clean and sober. I'm 1 00% sure about this.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.386
- Then we're in.
- Good.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.931
Now let's hear you top that news.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.725
Sloan's pregnant.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.104
- Ari?
- What?

02:27.189 --> 02:29.023
- Ari!
- What is it?

02:29.107 --> 02:31.818
Your football coaches are here.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.903
- What?
- The ones you paid a fortune to come

02:33.987 --> 02:38.157
- and motivate your troops.
- Right, right, right.

02:38.242 --> 02:41.160
Send them to the troops.
I don't need motivation.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.120
Actually, you do.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.915
And you went against my vote on this,
so please just get up

02:46.041 --> 02:48.501
- and at least say hello.
- Okay.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.754
And try to present some strength.

02:51.839 --> 02:55.508
They can potentially bring in some very big
clients for our sports department.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.302
Do I not look strong?

02:59.471 --> 03:02.223
There they are! Barry. How are you, guys?

03:02.307 --> 03:03.516
- Mike.
- What's up, Ari?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.767
- All right.
- How are you doing, Ari?

03:04.852 --> 03:07.186
- How are you doing?
- How do I look?

03:07.271 --> 03:09.772
- You look like shit. You been eating?
- I have not been.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.190
- Everything all right?
- He's fine.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.026
Well, I'm getting divorced, actually.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.695
- Sorry to hear about that, Ari.
- Yeah, that's tough.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.780
- Yeah, it is.
- Gentlemen, he's fine.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.075
Well, actually, I'm devastated.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.579
Yeah, but I don't...
I don't wanna bring your energy down.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.915
Go and tell my people
what it's like to control 350-Ib men

03:28.000 --> 03:29.709
who are usually carrying firearms, okay?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.711
Motivate my losers!

03:35.299 --> 03:37.216
I gotta go.

03:37.301 --> 03:38.801
- He's a fucking mess.
- He is.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.721
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.976
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to talk.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.854
- You all right?
- Well, I haven't been sleeping.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.064
Me either. Or eating.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.650
We need to tell
the kids what's going on.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.111
This is hanging over everything.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.863
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:00.324 --> 04:05.036
And I was wondering
if you wanted to do that together.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.248
Oh, yeah, we should...
We should do that together.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.460
Okay. I think we should go to Dr. Marcus
and ask for her advice.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.545
Why do we need her advice?

04:14.630 --> 04:16.797
I need it and I'd like you to be there.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.716
Sure.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.844
Can you do it today? She's available at 1:00.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.262
Okay.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.056
Thanks.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.601
I don't understand.
What are you gonna do in New York?

04:28.685 --> 04:31.187
- I'll figure it out.
- And you're just gonna throw everything away

04:31.271 --> 04:32.438
that you built here the last eight years?

04:32.522 --> 04:34.982
- Yeah. What choice do I have?
- Convince Sloan to stay.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.318
Oh, come on, Vince.
You don't think I tried that?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.111
She won't pick up the phone.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.656
I mean, I spoke to her lawyer.
I can't force her to stay.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.616
I can't even prove I'm the father
till the baby is born.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.619
- I have no rights.
- I'm sure it's not gonna come to that.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.206
Yeah. I know you guys always make fun of me
'cause I'm a good conservative Catholic boy,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.875
but this isn't exactly the way I drew things up
if you know what I mean.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.962
- Now you're gonna have to adjust.
- To what?

04:56.046 --> 04:58.547
The only thing I can do
is go to New York and do my best

04:58.632 --> 05:01.133
to be as big a part of this kid's life as I can be.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.803
Were you even gonna tell me about this?

05:03.887 --> 05:07.807
- I called you last night.
- Yeah. Sorry, I was with Sophia.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.559
- Yeah. How was that?
- Amazing.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.436
- That's great.
- Really great.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.314
- In fact, I need to ask you something.
- What?

05:15.399 --> 05:18.401
- Will you come to Paris with us tonight?
- With you and Sophia?

05:18.485 --> 05:21.570
And Turtle and Johnny
and of course I wanna invite Ari.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.406
- Invite him to what?
- To my wedding.

05:26.576 --> 05:30.037
Vince, in all honesty, I don't have time
for this shit right now. Please.

05:30.122 --> 05:33.207
E, I'm serious. I want you to be my best man.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.251
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey!

05:35.335 --> 05:37.253
- Why don't I talk to Sloan?
- What? No!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.630
- I think she'll listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!

05:39.756 --> 05:42.133
I don't want you getting involved, all right?

05:42.217 --> 05:43.759
Sloan's family hates me enough as it is.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.302
The only thing you're gonna do
is make it worse.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.679
How can I make it worse?

05:46.763 --> 05:49.432
Well, I don't know. But a guy who's getting
married to a girl after 24 hours

05:49.516 --> 05:51.183
probably isn't the best guy
to take advice from.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.227
Yeah, maybe you're right. But either way,

05:54.438 --> 05:57.648
come to Paris just for a few days.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.650
I couldn't do this without you.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.280
Hello?

06:05.449 --> 06:06.532
Oh, hey, Sloan.

06:06.742 --> 06:09.869
I should have expected
E would send the gang over.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.788
- E has no idea we're here.
- We're actually here for Vince.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.541
- What's the difference?
Sloan, we know you're upset.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.960
We understand, but Vince is getting married.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.712
And he wants you to come to the wedding.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.090
Guys, I appreciate the effort,
but I'm not gonna fall for this.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.468
No, no. Sloan, this is no joke.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.094
He really is getting married.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.889
To who? He was single last Wednesday.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.933
Her name is Sophia Lear
and she's our second-favorite woman,

06:33.018 --> 06:35.728
after you, of course. But she's amazing

06:36.021 --> 06:38.147
and they are in love.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.192
Look, this is gonna be
a very exclusive affair,

06:41.276 --> 06:43.069
but it's important to Vince that you attend.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.403
It's important to all of us.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.948
And why am I such an important guest?

06:48.366 --> 06:49.867
'Cause you're carrying our baby.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.079
- Your baby?
Yeah. That's the way we are, Sloan.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.332
You know that. Even if you lose E,
you're never gonna lose us.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.544
- When is it?
- Tonight.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.797
You guys are messing with me.

07:03.173 --> 07:08.511
No, no, Sloan, Vince is getting married,
and we want you to be there.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.806
Where is it?

07:11.890 --> 07:15.476
- Paris.
- This isn't even a good trick!

07:15.769 --> 07:18.771
What? You wanna get me
on a plane to Paris with E and you think

07:18.855 --> 07:21.065
that's gonna make me
forget all that's happened?

07:21.149 --> 07:22.942
No, Sloan.
We want you at the wedding.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.862
I swear on my life
that Vince is going to Paris to get married.

07:26.947 --> 07:31.700
And it's really important to him and to us
that you and your little baby

07:31.785 --> 07:35.538
- are present.
- I appreciate that.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.541
So you'll come?

07:39.876 --> 07:43.087
I have to ask you something else
and I need you to be honest.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.131
Yeah! I swear on my life.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.007
Swear on your career.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.885
Okay.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.888
Did E fuck Melinda?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.766
No, no. I swear on my career

07:55.892 --> 07:57.768
E did not fuck Melinda.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.151
What time does the plane leave?

08:05.235 --> 08:06.485
8:00 p. m.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.029
I'll think about it.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.240
That's all we can ask.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.909
Wow, Drama,
you swore on your career?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.911
I had my balls crossed.

08:17.497 --> 08:21.709
The most important thing
is that you present a united front.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.753
This is what
we have decided is best for the family.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.673
- I didn't decide that.
- Ari, please,

08:27.757 --> 08:29.884
we need to make the kids feel okay about this.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.385
Well, I don't know how to do that.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.013
That's why we're here, to learn.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.722
Let's try a little role play.

08:35.807 --> 08:39.184
Melissa, you'll be Sarah.
Ari, talk to your daughter.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.520
Honey,

08:45.483 --> 08:49.820
I love your mother
and you guys more than anything,

08:50.614 --> 08:53.949
- but your mother has decided...
- Ari.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.452
Lies. We have decided...

08:56.536 --> 09:01.081
We have decided
that we are getting a divorce.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.708
Why?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.711
- I have no idea.
- Really? You have none?

09:05.795 --> 09:06.837
No.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.177
I would like to tell the kids tonight.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.887
- Can you do that?
- What is the rush?

09:14.971 --> 09:18.057
Are you trying to get a quickie
divorce so you can run off with Flay?

09:18.141 --> 09:20.684
- We broke up.
- Why?

09:20.769 --> 09:24.230
Because he knew
I wasn't ready for a relationship now,

09:24.314 --> 09:27.691
unlike you who have somehow in less than
a week managed to fall for a woman

09:27.776 --> 09:29.652
that I've long suspected you of being with.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.945
No. We ended it, too.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.113
Why?

09:33.198 --> 09:35.407
Because she knows that I still love you.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.328
- Do you still love him?
- What kind of question is that?

09:39.412 --> 09:42.331
- Of course I do.
- Well, maybe it's not too late to try again.

09:42.457 --> 09:46.543
My life is disappearing
and I don't wanna wake up and find myself 60

09:46.628 --> 09:49.588
- and have no one to talk to.
- You can always talk to me.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.091
- You don't listen to me.
- I'm... I'm listening right now.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.343
You have been an absentee
father and husband for years

09:54.427 --> 09:57.179
and I know you don't mean it,
but I don't want that anymore.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.557
Absentee father?
I resent what you're saying to me right now.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.059
And I don't think our kids would agree.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.687
- You can ask them.
- I will.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.273
And then we will tell them tonight?

10:08.483 --> 10:09.858
Yeah. Okay.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.946
You're gonna love her. Trust me.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.241
Ma, between this and E,
you might even get me back to New York.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.159
Really. Ma, I love you.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.287
I'll call you on the way. Bye.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.289
So you're really
gonna move back to New York?

10:23.373 --> 10:26.041
Well, Sophia is based out of there
and I can help E out

10:26.126 --> 10:28.585
and I know Johnny and Turtle will wanna
be there as much as possible.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.630
You guys are good friends.
I wouldn't move west of Gower for a dude.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.966
Well, we basically
lived together our whole lives.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.467
Hey, maybe y'all
will live together with the kid.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.137
- It'll be like 3 Men and a Little Lady.
- Yeah. And if he has a boy,

10:38.221 --> 10:40.264
it'll be like three men and two little men.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.682
Mr. Chase?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.893
What do you think of this?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.854
It's 5.4 carats.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.106
- Vince?
- Rachel.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.232
Hi.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.736
- How are you?
- Well, not as good as you obviously.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.155
- What's this about?
- I'm getting married.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.990
- Shut up.
- Really.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.826
This ring is pretty amazing.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.828
Is it big enough?
I wanna make sure it makes a statement.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.455
It depends. What's she like?

11:04.539 --> 11:06.707
Unlike any other woman I've ever been with.

11:07.042 --> 11:10.085
Smart, sophisticated
and for some reason she likes me.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.630
Carly, I think you should show him that
massive emerald cut in the window.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.091
- It's insane.
- How insane?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.634
It's not about the money.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.179
She's wearing this forever. I mean, hopefully.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.513
Okay.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.599
I gotta grab this. It's Terrance.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.602
- Hello.
- Vincent Chase.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.646
Mr. McQuewick,
thank you so much for calling me back.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.691
I presume this has got something to
do with your friend Mr. Murphy,

11:32.776 --> 11:34.693
considering your career is going so well.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.780
- You don't need me.
- It is about Eric, actually.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.531
Well, let me save you the time.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.076
I have nothing to discuss in terms of him.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.952
He's a really good person, Terrance.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.580
He threw my best friend
out of his own company.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.706
That was business.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.875
Of course had sex with my ex-wife.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.460
No. No, no, no.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.879
He didn't. They're working together.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.715
I never wanna see your friend
near my daughter again.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.551
And that's all that I'll say about it.

11:59.636 --> 12:03.222
Terrance, I understand, but the reality is
they're gonna see each other again.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.974
- They'll have no choice.
- Oh, really? And why is that?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.394
'Cause like it or not, this baby is Eric's, too.

12:09.646 --> 12:10.729
What baby?

12:11.439 --> 12:12.648
Um.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.568
What the hell are you talking about?
Jesus Christ.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.404
I gotta call my fucking daughter!

12:19.364 --> 12:21.698
- Whoops.
- He didn't know, did he?

12:21.783 --> 12:23.951
- Nope.
- Mr. Chase,

12:24.911 --> 12:26.578
here's the ring from the window.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.580
It's 6.45 karats

12:28.665 --> 12:30.416
and costs $1 .4 million.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.836
Yeah, that's fine
as long as it comes in a nice box.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.380
Hey, baby, I stopped by school.

12:36.464 --> 12:40.092
I wanted to talk to you and your brother,
but they told me that you're off today.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.802
We told you last night the school was closed

12:41.886 --> 12:45.514
- for teacher service day.
- Oh, I guess I didn't hear you, honey.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.599
- Are you okay, Daddy?
- Yeah.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.436
- You got my stuff?
- Yeah.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.937
Listen,

12:54.691 --> 12:55.816
am I a good dad?

12:56.568 --> 12:59.695
- What do you mean?
- Do I ignore you?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.489
- What?
- Do I listen when you and your brother talk?

13:02.574 --> 13:04.533
- Did Mom say something to you?
- No.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.035
'Cause I don't wanna be
in the middle of you two.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.662
No, no, no, she didn't say a thing.

13:08.746 --> 13:12.124
Please don't say anything to her.
This is just for me, honey.

13:12.208 --> 13:16.128
Look, I was mad last night
when I said whatever I said.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.838
Well, what did you say?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.756
I said that
I was pissed that you don't listen to me.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.259
When haven't I listened to you?

13:22.343 --> 13:24.636
Remember my friends,
the transfer students from Italy?

13:24.721 --> 13:26.930
- Yes.
- You don't remember.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.267
- No.
- I gave you their demo, Dad, of their music.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.145
They're like opera singers
and they're amazing. I told you.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.356
Oh, oh, right, right.
Yes, of course I remember. It's on my desk.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.485
Well, I was embarrassed when they asked me
yesterday if you'd listened to it yet.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.487
I'm going to listen to it today.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.405
I gave it to you two months ago.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.574
Honey, I'm sorry. I forgot.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.244
I'm sorry I said it to Mom.
I know that you're busy.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.205
I'm never too busy for you.

13:51.289 --> 13:54.249
Then listen to that.
I told them I'm getting a commission

13:54.334 --> 13:56.585
- if it goes anywhere.
- My daughter the agent.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.838
- When did you grow up?
- I don't know.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.966
- I love you, Sarah.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.136
- I'll see you tonight, right?
- Yes, see you tonight. Bye.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.680
I don't believe it.
- I don't believe you guys went over there.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.892
- She was happy to see us.
- Well, she just sent me a text message saying

14:11.976 --> 14:14.978
that she doesn't want me or my friends
anywhere near her. So obviously she wasn't.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.898
- She already didn't want you near her.
- Yeah, but us, what did we do?

14:17.982 --> 14:21.151
Nothing, just gave her a nice
heartfelt invite to a wedding.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.778
- ERIC: Yeah.
- Which she's thinking about going to.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.364
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- I'm telling you, she was.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.366
1 00%. We had her on the hook.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.285
- She's not over you, E. Right?
- Right what?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.871
- She's not over you.
- Why would you say that?

14:32.956 --> 14:35.123
'Cause she was asking
if you really did bang Melinda.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.793
- Which means she still cares.
- What'd you say?

14:37.877 --> 14:41.421
- Drama swore on his career that you didn't.
- Really? Your career?

14:42.507 --> 14:45.092
- Yeah.
- Wow. Thanks.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.176
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.762
- Yo.
- What's going on?

14:48.846 --> 14:51.348
We thought
we had Sloan convinced to come to Paris.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.892
- Really? When?
- Yeah. Like an hour ago.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.728
And now she's sending me
nasty text messages and I don't know why.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.398
- I might know why.
- What do you mean?

15:01.734 --> 15:02.734
Terrance?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.737
- What the fuck does he want?
- I might have an idea about that also.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.447
What do you mean?

15:10.076 --> 15:12.578
- Hello.
- I just want you to know

15:12.662 --> 15:15.872
that I'm coming to find you
and when I do, I'm gonna shoot you.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.500
- Terrance.
- Watch for me, Mr. Murphy.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.335
I'm coming for you.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.130
What the fuck did you do?

15:23.214 --> 15:25.757
I may have tried to reason with Terrance

15:25.842 --> 15:28.218
before Sloan
had an opportunity to tell him the news.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.804
- Oh, my God.
- But... But I will call her. I'm sorry.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.724
No, no, no,
let us since we're on her good side now.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.892
No one call her. Just leave it alone, please.

15:35.977 --> 15:36.977
E, I was just trying to help.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.187
I fucking told you
not to get involved this morning.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.815
- You didn't tell us.
- I'm really, really sorry, E.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.778
All right. I know. I appreciate it.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.363
It doesn't matter. It's all my fault.

15:48.656 --> 15:52.534
I did a lot more damage before today.
So just let it go.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.746
We got a wedding to celebrate, right?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.956
I wanna go get ready.
I'll see you guys back at the hotel.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.754
Look, Ari, I... I don't remember seeing a CD.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.506
- It's gotta be here, so find it.
- Maybe someone took it.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.508
Who would be stupid enough
to take something out of my office?

16:08.593 --> 16:12.429
- Lloyd sometimes does.
- Does he?

16:12.513 --> 16:14.139
- Oh, no.
- Lloyd!

16:14.223 --> 16:15.724
Please don't tell him I told you that.
He scares me.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.851
- Lloyd?
- Yes, Ari.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.228
- Did you take a CD off my desk?
- The young opera singers?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.355
- Yes.
- I have it.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.231
You took a CD off my desk?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.984
It was sitting there for months
and you know how I adore the opera.

16:26.069 --> 16:29.029
- Where is it?
- It's in my computer. I use it to ease stress.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.324
Well, ease mine,
so I can tell my daughter that I heard it. Now!

16:32.408 --> 16:34.493
- You're just gonna love it, Ari.
- Ari?

16:34.577 --> 16:37.120
Play it, Lloyd.
Play it throughout the whole office. What?

16:37.205 --> 16:39.623
Just wanted to know
if everything was okay with the loan.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.417
- Why wouldn't it be?
- Rumor has it you were at the bank today.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.127
You... What,
you have people following me now?

16:44.295 --> 16:45.921
- I'm just asking, Ari.
- Why?

16:47.131 --> 16:49.383
Because if you have
any problem with that loan

16:49.467 --> 16:53.553
for any reason... Look, I know divorce
can cause financial hardship

16:53.638 --> 16:55.889
- even to someone as well off as you.
- Shh!

16:55.973 --> 16:58.892
But I am willing to put my money in.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.937
I just want the majority share that I deserve

17:02.021 --> 17:05.190
so I don't get
outvoted on things like football coaches.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.237
Listen to that, Babs.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.115
Do you hear that beautiful music?

17:13.574 --> 17:15.951
- I hear it, Ari.
- Turn it up, Lloyd.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.538
My daughter found them, my daughter.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.040
She's about to graduate from high school.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.376
- Can you believe that?
- Ari...

17:24.460 --> 17:26.962
Shut the fuck up, Babs! And open your ears.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.381
Jake, get my daughter on the phone.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.468
- Louder, Lloyd!
- Jesus Christ, Ari.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.930
- This is a place of business.
- Not for me, not anymore.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.433
- What does that mean?
- It means take it.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.102
Take it all! Take the company.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.146
Take your shares, take mine.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.815
I don't give a fuck!

17:46.899 --> 17:50.819
The only thing you can't take
is this picture of my family

17:50.903 --> 17:52.821
and my lucky horseshoe.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.116
- Are you fucking serious?
- I've got Sarah for you.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.035
Put her through to my cell. I'm going home.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.954
Ciao, Babs.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.804
Vince, what is there to say?

18:18.222 --> 18:21.767
- I'm sorry, for one.
- I was gonna tell my father anyway.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.060
I was just waiting for the right time.

18:24.145 --> 18:27.773
I will never forgive myself
if I was the official ending of you and E.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.649
You weren't.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.234
Can I come in?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.783
The guys said you were gonna come tonight.

18:37.867 --> 18:42.746
I thought about it for a minute
because they were so sweet.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.999
And... Wait, are you really getting married?

18:46.083 --> 18:47.751
Yes. Yes, I am.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.670
- She's in the car. Do you wanna meet her?
- No. Look at me.

18:50.755 --> 18:54.299
You look amazing. Sloan, you always do.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.092
And you're having a baby.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.180
You and E are having a baby.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.474
You wanna know
what made me wanna marry Sophia?

19:03.184 --> 19:07.854
It was that for the first time in my life
I felt what E always told me he felt for you.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.357
And I could see the future.
I could see the whole family.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.317
- Vince.
- Do you still love him, Sloan?

19:12.401 --> 19:15.570
It doesn't matter. My father hates him.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.449
And for a moment today I actually forgot
how much when the guys were here,

19:19.534 --> 19:21.409
but he hates him. It will never work.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.329
And I need to know the truth about Melinda.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.289
- What truth?
- Did he sleep with her?

19:26.374 --> 19:27.541
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.962
No, I don't. And it doesn't matter
'cause even if he did, he did it over you.

19:32.046 --> 19:36.591
Guy's been with five women his whole life,
not because he can't get them. He's loyal.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.510
He's emotional and reactive...

19:38.594 --> 19:42.013
I mean, a little Jack Russell Terrier.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.433
And listen to me, Sloan,

19:45.518 --> 19:48.186
he will kill for you and this baby.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.689
He's moving to New York
even if you're not together.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.900
He loves you, Sloan, always has.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.903
And nothing else matters.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.823
E's your family now.
And whatever your father thinks of him,

19:59.907 --> 20:02.075
he's gonna have to get over it,

20:02.159 --> 20:04.703
unless you're sure you are.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.710
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.963
- I... I thought you were coming at 8:00.
- I... I wanted to come early.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.883
- 'Cause the kids just went out for ice cream.
- No, I know, I told them to.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.385
- Why would you do that?
- Because I wanted to talk to you first.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.595
Ari.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.555
Do you remember
when we were graduating college

20:23.639 --> 20:26.224
and we said that we should take a year
off and move to Florence?

20:26.309 --> 20:27.809
- Yeah?
- We never did it.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.645
- No, you went right to work.
- Let's do it now.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.980
- Move to Florence?
- Yes.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.565
What, six day, seven-night cure-all?

20:33.649 --> 20:36.776
Three hundred and sixty-five nights to start.
We'll see how it goes.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.445
Then you would
be on the phone the whole time.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.155
With who? I don't have a job.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.074
- What are you... What are you talking about?
- I quit.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.618
Well, I didn't ask you to do that.

20:44.702 --> 20:45.952
Well, I wanted to.

20:47.622 --> 20:48.830
MELISSA: What is this?

20:53.377 --> 20:55.754
We have enough money
for five lifetimes, all right?

20:55.838 --> 20:57.631
I'm not saying it's gonna be forever.

20:57.715 --> 21:00.383
But Sarah is going to college
and this will be great for Jonah.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.553
And more importantly
it'll be great for us, okay?

21:03.638 --> 21:06.014
And that is all that matters to me.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.558
- Really?
- Really.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.227
I would marry you a thousand times over.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.897
You're the love of my life.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.859
I wouldn't know what to do with
myself without you. I wouldn't.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.131
Oh, my God, Ari, what if I had said no?

21:41.217 --> 21:42.509
It's still a good song.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.480
You quit and didn't tell me?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.899
- I did it all for my family, Lloyd.
- Lloyd.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.318
Hi, Melissa. And hi to them. I love them.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.696
And I'm glad your family is fine,

22:02.780 --> 22:06.533
- but I'm family, too, aren't I?
- You'll always be the gay son I never wanted.

22:06.617 --> 22:09.160
- Yes, Lloyd.
- But what will happen to me without you?

22:09.286 --> 22:11.079
- You will shine, Lloyd.
- How?

22:11.372 --> 22:13.707
You are my inspiration, Ari.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.875
I'm still learning to be more like you.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.169
No, you're not like me.
And you don't wanna be.

22:18.254 --> 22:21.006
You're fair,
and you're honest, and you don't like women.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.591
I need you, Ari!

22:23.676 --> 22:25.635
You don't need me, but Barbara does

22:25.720 --> 22:27.721
'cause she doesn't have
a clue what she's doing.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.306
You're more cunning and cuntier
than she will ever be.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.226
You will shine, Lloyd.
And I'm giving you your first clients,

22:33.310 --> 22:35.979
- right there.
- Really?

22:36.063 --> 22:38.481
- Really.
- And what about Vince?

22:38.566 --> 22:40.191
- What about Vince?
- He just called me,

22:40.276 --> 22:42.193
- said he's been calling you.
- I've been busy. What's up?

22:42.278 --> 22:44.779
- Anything wrong?
- He's getting married.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.575
- What?
- And E is pregnant!

23:02.631 --> 23:06.426
Scotty.
- What's up, boys?

23:06.677 --> 23:09.971
- What are you doing?
- I just wanted to see you guys off,

23:10.097 --> 23:13.600
tell Vince good luck. You know, how many
times is a guy gonna get married?

23:13.684 --> 23:15.560
Four times, five times tops?

23:15.644 --> 23:19.522
A little help? I mean,
I'm a millionaire now, you know?

23:19.607 --> 23:21.524
I don't care if you're a billionaire, Turtle.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.651
You'll always be a valet to me.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.236
What's up, E?

23:25.321 --> 23:27.614
I guess someone told you
I was moving to New York.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.450
- It wasn't me.
- You're really gonna go?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.911
- A lot more to the story now.
- Like what?

23:32.995 --> 23:35.330
I'll tell you about it when I get back.
Where's Vince?

23:35.414 --> 23:39.042
On time and waiting,
anxious to get my future started.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.044
Wow, so this really is happening, huh?

23:41.378 --> 23:44.839
Well, I like the ring too much to not at least
see how we are as traveling partners.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.301
Vince! Vince. Hold the plane.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.345
Who's the broad?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.222
It's his wife, you jerkoff.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.099
- VINCE: I can't believe you made it.
- Listen,

23:54.183 --> 23:57.435
- I got a stowaway, if that's all right.
- VINCE: Of course.

23:58.729 --> 24:01.856
- Hi, Vince.
- Hi. This is Sophia.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.316
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.943
- Congratulations to both of you.
- Thank you.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.153
Nice to meet you... You did well for yourself.

24:07.238 --> 24:09.239
You two... So this is all okay?

24:11.033 --> 24:12.867
- It will be.
- Amazing!

24:12.952 --> 24:14.202
You're gonna have
to find a new agent though.

24:14.912 --> 24:15.954
You're quitting, huh?

24:16.038 --> 24:18.123
I did quit. Rumor has it you did as well.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.625
I guess we both
gotta do what's right for the greater good.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.461
- Well, you're not really quitting, are you?
- We'll talk when I get back.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.131
Wow, are you guys really trying
to steal my day?

24:27.341 --> 24:29.634
- Scott, you're not coming?
- No, I... I wanna come,

24:29.718 --> 24:32.720
but it looks like a family thing,
so I wish you luck and shalom.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.514
All right. Well, then let's go!

24:34.598 --> 24:36.474
Let's get out of here.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.477
Except you, E.

24:39.562 --> 24:40.687
What do you mean?

24:40.771 --> 24:43.189
- I think this plane might be a little crowded.
- That's hilarious.

24:43.274 --> 24:45.066
- Are you gonna make a short joke?
- No.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.359
I could.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.778
- I got you your own plane.
- What are you talking about?

24:51.282 --> 24:52.365
Oh.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.367
Oh.

24:55.870 --> 24:56.870
What did you do?

24:56.954 --> 24:59.664
All I could. The rest is up to you.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.500
You got a plane
that'll take you anywhere in the world.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.587
- What happens next...
- Whatever it is,

25:05.713 --> 25:08.464
- don't tell us shit unless it's resolved.
- Seriously.

25:08.549 --> 25:11.092
The back and forth
is too much for any real man to take.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.136
Are you coming?

25:15.264 --> 25:16.598
Go, pizza boy.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.184
Hey, remember these words, E.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.561
From behind you don't even look preggers.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.021
Oh, tell Sloan if it's a boy,

25:23.105 --> 25:25.273
- Baby Sal, great name.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:25.357 --> 25:27.984
- Does this mean you're not quitting?
- We'll talk.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.069
- Good luck, E. Hey.
- VINCE: Yeah, good luck.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.032
- I think you're gonna be fine. Yeah.
- I appreciate that.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.575
You wanna hug it out?

25:37.036 --> 25:38.119
Nah.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.455
What about the wedding?

25:41.207 --> 25:42.624
I'll find you.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.793
Thanks again, Vince.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.893
You're amazing.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.103
You ain't seen nothing yet.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.905
Wow. A little emotional.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.199
Yeah, me too.

26:16.283 --> 26:19.118
We better find something to fuck in Paris.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.875
Someone told me there's a girl out there

26:26.001 --> 26:29.295
With love in her eyes and flowers

26:29.380 --> 26:32.090
In her hair

26:44.561 --> 26:47.772
Took my chances on a big jet plane

26:47.856 --> 26:52.527
Never let them tell you
that they're all the same

26:55.864 --> 26:59.742
Oh, the sea was red
and the sky was gray

26:59.827 --> 27:06.207
Wondered how tomorrow
could ever follow today

27:08.544 --> 27:12.088
The mountains and the canyon
started to tremble and shake

27:12.172 --> 27:15.758
As the children of the sun began to awake

27:17.219 --> 27:19.262
Watch out

27:21.265 --> 27:23.182
Seems that the wrath of the gods

27:23.267 --> 27:26.144
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow

27:26.228 --> 27:29.230
I think I might be sinking

27:33.485 --> 27:36.487
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time

27:36.572 --> 27:39.699
I'll meet you up there
where the path runs straight

27:39.783 --> 27:41.868
And high...

27:45.247 --> 27:48.333
What do you think we should do today?

27:48.417 --> 27:50.960
Whatever you want, museum, shopping.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.590
Maybe we should just stay in again.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.217
Mmm. Sounds good to me.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.974
I am gonna go get another bottle of wine.

28:05.059 --> 28:07.602
- Ooh, grazie, bella.
- Mmm.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.080
Hello.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.999
I've e-mailed and called you
a dozen times, Ari.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.460
- John?
- Where have you been hiding?

28:32.544 --> 28:36.798
I am in heaven, John.
I left my Berry and all my troubles behind.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.674
You vanished like Salman Rushdie.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.677
I wonder if he was this happy.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.430
- Are you really?
- Can't you hear me smile?

28:44.515 --> 28:46.182
I want you back here, Ari.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.142
Not gonna happen, John.

28:48.227 --> 28:52.313
You passed on running my studio once
which I thought was asinine.

28:52.606 --> 28:55.274
Are you really silly enough to pass
on an offer from me twice?

28:55.359 --> 28:58.027
Your studio head is doing a great job.

28:58.112 --> 29:01.239
- You don't need me.
- I don't want you to replace her.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.032
I want you to replace me

29:03.659 --> 29:04.867
as chairman and CEO.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.370
It's my time and yours.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.123
- John...
- This is notjust about movies.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.583
It's about our film division
that grossed $4 billion.

29:12.668 --> 29:16.254
It's about a television network
and three premium cable networks.

29:16.338 --> 29:20.091
You want a sports franchise?
Buy one yourself.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.801
'Cause there'll only be
a handful of other people

29:21.885 --> 29:23.344
making the sort of money you'll be making.

29:23.846 --> 29:26.639
And while everyone you know
may own the fanciest clothes

29:26.723 --> 29:29.851
and the best cars,
you will own the companies that sell them.

29:30.227 --> 29:33.146
If you wanna know what heaven really is, Ari,

29:34.189 --> 29:35.690
try being God.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.483
Ari?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.445
John, I just got here.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.196
You're the only guy for this and you know it.

29:42.281 --> 29:46.075
Rest, relax. I'll try you again in one week.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.497
- Who was that?
- It was...

29:51.957 --> 29:53.458
You know, a cable company, they just...

29:53.542 --> 29:56.169
They wanted to know
if we're bored and need television.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.504
- We don't need anything.
- Nope.
