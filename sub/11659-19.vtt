00:55.800 --> 00:57.834
OH, YOU
COULDN'T SLEEP EITHER?

00:57.900 --> 00:58.867
NO.

00:58.934 --> 01:02.266
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MA'S REALLY GOING.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.934
I'VE TRIED
TO DISSUADE HER.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.800
SHE STILL INSISTS
SHE'S LEAVING.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.533
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.900
LET ME GET THE CHEESECAKE,
AND WE'LL TALK.

01:11.967 --> 01:13.533
OH, MY GOD!

01:13.600 --> 01:14.567
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:14.633 --> 01:16.633
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CRISIS,

01:16.700 --> 01:18.867
AND THERE'S
NO CHEESECAKE.

01:18.934 --> 01:20.800
DIDN'T WE BUY ONE
YESTERDAY?

01:20.867 --> 01:24.467
YES, BUT I FOUND
TWO GRAY HAIRS.

01:24.533 --> 01:25.800
BLANCHE, YOU'RE OVER 50.

01:25.867 --> 01:27.867
FINDING TWO GRAY HAIRS

01:27.934 --> 01:30.300
IS NO REASON TO EAT
A WHOLE CHEESECAKE.

01:30.367 --> 01:31.767
I FOUND
THE TWO GRAY HAIRS

01:31.834 --> 01:33.900
IN THE CHEESECAKE...

01:33.967 --> 01:36.300
SO I THREW IT OUT.

01:36.367 --> 01:37.834
HI, GIRLS.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.467
I FIGURED
THIS MIGHT HAPPEN,

01:40.533 --> 01:42.600
SO I WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT A CHEESECAKE.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.100
OH, ROSE,
THAT'S GREAT!

01:44.166 --> 01:45.600
WHAT'S REALLY GREAT

01:45.667 --> 01:47.700
IS THEY FIRED
THAT GRAY-HAIRED BAKER

01:47.767 --> 01:50.667
WHO REFUSED
TO WEAR A NET.

01:50.734 --> 01:52.233
LET'S SLICE THIS UP

01:52.300 --> 01:54.967
AND SOLVE
OUR SOPHIA PROBLEM.

01:55.033 --> 01:56.300
HERE, DARLING.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.633
OH, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY PROBLEMS

01:58.700 --> 02:01.100
WE HAVE SOLVED
OVER A CHEESECAKE

02:01.166 --> 02:03.100
AT THIS KITCHEN TABLE?

02:03.166 --> 02:04.600
NO, DOROTHY. HOW MANY?

02:04.667 --> 02:06.867
147, ROSE!

02:12.133 --> 02:15.000
THE POINT I'M MAKING
IS THAT WE'VE HAD

02:15.066 --> 02:18.033
A LOT OF GREAT
LATE-NIGHT TALKS

02:18.100 --> 02:19.066
RIGHT HERE.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.700
MOST OF THEM
WERE ABOUT SEX.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.200
OH...WELL, OF COURSE,

02:23.266 --> 02:24.967
WE DO TALK ABOUT SEX,

02:25.033 --> 02:27.133
BUT WE DISCUSS
OTHER THINGS.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.567
WE CONSOLE EACH OTHER.

02:28.633 --> 02:29.567
WE HELP EACH OTHER.

02:29.633 --> 02:30.967
WE ADVISE EACH OTHER.

02:31.033 --> 02:33.867
AND THEN...WE TALK
ABOUT SEX AGAIN.

02:35.166 --> 02:39.166
I AM SO GLAD MY DATE
WITH BARRY IS TOMORROW.

02:39.233 --> 02:41.900
THE FAT WON'T HAVE
TIME TO SHOW.

02:41.967 --> 02:42.900
IT WON'T?

02:42.967 --> 02:45.533
IT TAKES SEVERAL DAYS.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.500
WHERE DOES IT GO
IN THE MEANTIME?

02:47.567 --> 02:48.500
TO CONNECTICUT!

02:48.567 --> 02:51.133
HOW DO I KNOW WHERE?

02:51.200 --> 02:54.500
THE MINUTE I EAT IT,
I BALLOON UP.

02:54.567 --> 02:55.834
I CAN GO
OUT TO DINNER

02:55.900 --> 02:57.133
AND DURING THE MEAL,

02:57.200 --> 02:59.266
MY PANTS
GET SO TIGHT,

02:59.333 --> 03:01.367
MY FEET TURN BLUE.

03:01.433 --> 03:05.500
I JUST WANT
TO BE SVELTE FOR BARRY.

03:05.567 --> 03:07.900
BARRY GLICK IS VERY
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

03:08.400 --> 03:14.633
BARRY WAS THE MAN THAT
I WANTED TO BE THE FIRST.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.066
FIRST WHERE?

03:16.133 --> 03:18.934
ON MARS, ROSE!

03:19.000 --> 03:20.867
MY FIRST LOVER.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.200
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

03:22.266 --> 03:24.700
STANLEY.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

03:24.767 --> 03:25.900
STANLEY.

03:25.967 --> 03:28.667
I WENT TO A DRIVE-IN
WITH STANLEY.

03:28.734 --> 03:31.000
HE SAID HE WAS BEING
SHIPPED TO KOREA

03:31.066 --> 03:32.066
AND WOULD PROBABLY DIE,

03:32.133 --> 03:34.467
AND IT WOULD
MEAN SO MUCH.

03:34.533 --> 03:37.567
THAT WAS MY PART
OF THE WAR EFFORT.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.266
IT TOOK THREE SECONDS.

03:42.333 --> 03:46.400
I WASN'T SURE THAT WE HAD
DONE ANYTHING, ACTUALLY,

03:46.467 --> 03:49.400
UNTIL NINE MONTHS LATER
WHEN THE BABY CAME.

03:49.467 --> 03:52.233
THEN I FIGURED OUT
THAT WE HAD.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.800
YOU KNOW, THAT
WAS MY ONLY PROOF.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.300
I WAITED TILL
MY WEDDING NIGHT.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.033
NO!

04:02.100 --> 04:03.700
YES!

04:03.767 --> 04:05.333
AND?

04:05.400 --> 04:08.967
AND...IT WAS A SURPRISE.

04:09.033 --> 04:10.367
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

04:10.433 --> 04:12.500
ANOTHER MAN SHOWED UP?

04:13.834 --> 04:15.867
WHAT I MEAN IS,

04:15.934 --> 04:20.066
I HAD NEVER...
SEEN A MAN BEFORE.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.467
A MAN?

04:27.533 --> 04:29.867
YOU KNOW--

04:29.934 --> 04:31.467
A MAN.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.000
NO.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.867
YES!

04:35.934 --> 04:37.333
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

04:37.400 --> 04:38.700
YOU MEAN YOU NEVER...

04:38.767 --> 04:40.834
SAW YOUR FATHER?

04:40.900 --> 04:43.066
MY FATHER?

04:43.133 --> 04:44.667
OH, NO--MY FATHER?

04:44.734 --> 04:46.900
OH, MY GOODNESS, NO!

04:46.967 --> 04:48.233
I WOULD HAVE SIMPLY DIED!

04:48.300 --> 04:49.266
OH, YOU DON'T--

04:49.333 --> 04:50.300
EASY!

04:50.367 --> 04:53.934
ALL RIGHT!

04:54.000 --> 04:56.367
THE ONLY THINGS
I EVER SAW

04:56.433 --> 04:58.300
WERE ANIMALS
ON THE FARM--

04:58.367 --> 05:00.667
THE BULLS
AND THE HORSES.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.667
TOUGH ACT
TO FOLLOW.

05:11.233 --> 05:14.300
ACTUALLY,
THAT FIRST NIGHT...

05:14.367 --> 05:16.233
I WAS KIND OF...

05:16.300 --> 05:18.033
WELL...

05:18.100 --> 05:19.800
APPALLED, I GUESS.

05:19.867 --> 05:22.400
BUT CHARLIE
WAS VERY PATIENT.

05:22.467 --> 05:24.900
IT WAS REALLY VERY NICE...

05:24.967 --> 05:26.767
ONCE I UNDERSTOOD THAT

05:26.834 --> 05:29.767
THAT'S WHAT YOU
WERE SUPPOSED TO DO,

05:29.834 --> 05:32.333
AND IT WASN'T SOME
COLOSSAL JOKE.

05:35.233 --> 05:38.900
DIDN'T YOU THINK IT WAS
A RIDICULOUS THING TO DO

05:38.967 --> 05:40.033
THE FIRST TIME?

05:40.767 --> 05:42.633
NO!

05:44.500 --> 05:47.300
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T WAIT
FOR MY WEDDING NIGHT.

05:47.367 --> 05:50.934
I COULDN'T.
I HAD THESE URGES.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.600
YOU KNOW, IN THE SOUTH
WE MATURE FASTER.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.300
I THINK IT'S THE HEAT.

05:58.266 --> 06:00.967
I THINK IT'S THE GIN.

06:02.233 --> 06:05.433
ANYHOW, MY FIRST
WAS BILLY.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.333
OH, I REMEMBER IT
SO WELL,

06:07.400 --> 06:09.333
JUST LIKE
IT WAS YESTERDAY.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.667
THAT NIGHT, UNDER
THE DOGWOOD TREES,

06:11.734 --> 06:14.467
THE AIR THICK
WITH PERFUME,

06:14.533 --> 06:15.834
AND ME WITH BILLY.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.500
OR BOBBY.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.900
YEAH, BOBBY.

06:20.967 --> 06:23.200
YEAH, IT WAS BOBBY.

06:23.266 --> 06:24.467
OR WAS IT BEN?

06:25.400 --> 06:26.700
OH, WHO KNOWS?

06:26.767 --> 06:29.734
ANYWAY, IT STARTED
WITH A "B."

06:31.967 --> 06:34.600
THAT FIRST TIME...

06:34.667 --> 06:37.333
DID YOU HAVE...

06:43.900 --> 06:45.867
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

06:45.934 --> 06:47.734
WHY, MANY TIMES
THAT FIRST TIME.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.934
MANY, MANY TIMES!

06:51.000 --> 06:52.266
YOU DID?

06:52.333 --> 06:53.600
YOU DIDN'T?

06:53.667 --> 06:54.934
NO!

06:55.000 --> 06:57.734
OH, IT WAS NICE.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.734
BEING NEAR CHARLIE
WAS NICE,

06:59.800 --> 07:02.133
BUT IT WAS FIVE YEARS
BEFORE I KNEW

07:02.200 --> 07:04.433
WHAT MADE YOUR EYES
GO BACK IN YOUR HEAD.

07:09.367 --> 07:12.533
DOROTHY, DID YOU...

07:12.600 --> 07:14.367
HAVE...

07:14.433 --> 07:15.633
HOW COULD I?

07:15.700 --> 07:19.000
IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAPPEN
BEFORE I WAS IN THE ROOM.

07:22.133 --> 07:23.600
BLANCHE, YOU ARE OUT OF BED.

07:23.667 --> 07:24.867
THIS IS WONDERFUL.

07:24.934 --> 07:26.367
NO, IT IS NOT WONDERFUL.

07:26.433 --> 07:27.600
I WAS LYING IN BED EATING

07:27.667 --> 07:29.100
AND IF I DON'T GET
UP AND WALK AROUND

07:29.166 --> 07:30.900
I'M GONNA BECOME
AS BIG AS A HIPPO.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.834
AND LIFE, IF I CAN STILL
CALL IT THAT

07:32.900 --> 07:35.433
HAS TO GO ON IN ONE FORM
OR THE OTHER. SO HERE I AM.

07:35.500 --> 07:40.133
I'LL JUST SPEND MY REMAINING
YEARS IN THE COMPANY OF WOMEN.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.567
ONLY REASON I'M STICKING AROUND

07:41.633 --> 07:44.300
IS TO READ DANIELLE STEEL'S
NEXT BOOK.

07:44.367 --> 07:46.567
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE YOU ARE
GOING THROUGH THE CHANGE?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.166
GOD, I HATE THAT EXPRESSION.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.934
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL, BLANCHE?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.300
IT'S NOTHING.

07:51.367 --> 07:54.667
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, YOU DON'T
GET CRAMPS ONCE A MONTH.

07:54.734 --> 07:57.033
YOU DON'T GO ON EATING BINGES
ONCE A MONTH.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.934
YOU DON'T GET CRAZY
ONCE A MONTH.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.500
YOU JUST GROW A BEARD.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.967
DON'T LISTEN TO HER, BLANCHE.

08:10.033 --> 08:11.800
YOU GROW A BEARD,
DOROTHY, BELIEVE ME.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.667
I WOKE UP ONE MORNING,
I LOOKED LIKE ARAFAT.

08:13.734 --> 08:17.367
OH, MY GOD.

08:17.433 --> 08:19.033
I NEVER GREW A BEARD.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.800
YOU NEVER GREW BRAINS, EITHER.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.734
WELL, I TELL YOU MENOPAUSE
WAS WONDERFUL FOR ME.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.767
IT MEANT NO MORE PMS.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.200
I NEVER HAD PMS.

08:29.266 --> 08:30.333
NEITHER DID I.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.233
BUT I HAD A BMW.

08:35.266 --> 08:36.367
I'VE HAD IT!

08:36.433 --> 08:38.233
THANKS TO ALL
THIS BICKERING,

08:38.300 --> 08:39.734
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

08:39.800 --> 08:42.066
LET'S FACE FACTS--

08:42.133 --> 08:44.567
WE JUST CAN'T
AGREE ON ANYTHING.

08:44.633 --> 08:47.333
IT'S OBVIOUS WE WEREN'T
MEANT TO LIVE TOGETHER.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.834
I HATE TO AGREE,

08:48.900 --> 08:50.166
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:50.233 --> 08:51.667
I THINK SO, TOO.

08:51.734 --> 08:53.567
IN FACT,
I KNOW SO.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.266
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED

08:56.333 --> 08:58.233
DURING THE GREAT
HERRING WAR.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.734
THE GREAT HERRING WAR?

09:04.800 --> 09:07.066
BETWEEN THE LINDSTROMS
AND THE JOHANNSENS.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.967
OH, THAT GREAT
HERRING WAR!

09:11.000 --> 09:12.333
THE TWO FAMILIES

09:12.400 --> 09:14.233
CONTROLLED THE MOST
FERTILE HERRING WATERS

09:14.300 --> 09:15.767
OFF THE NORWEGIAN COAST,

09:15.834 --> 09:18.633
SO NATURALLY, IT SEEMED
IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS

09:18.700 --> 09:19.867
TO BAND TOGETHER.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.567
OH, BOY,
WAS THAT A MISTAKE!

09:22.633 --> 09:25.700
THEY DISAGREED ON WHAT
TO DO WITH THE HERRING.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.433
WELL, THAT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.400
I MEAN,
THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE OVERWHELMING.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.600
EXACTLY.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.333
THE JOHANNSENS WANTED
TO PICKLE THE HERRING.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.567
THE LINDSTROMS WANTED TO
TRAIN THEM FOR THE CIRCUS.

09:41.367 --> 09:43.967
WEREN'T THEY KIND
OF HARD TO SEE,

09:44.033 --> 09:45.867
RIDING ON
THE ELEPHANTS?

09:46.967 --> 09:49.967
NOT THAT KIND OF CIRCUS.
A HERRING CIRCUS.

09:50.033 --> 09:51.934
SORT OF LIKE
SEA WORLD,

09:52.000 --> 09:53.333
ONLY SMALLER.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.867
MUCH, MUCH SMALLER.

09:56.934 --> 09:59.233
BUT BIGGER THAN
A FLEA CIRCUS.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.533
MM-HMM. TELL ME,
ROSE, UM...

10:05.166 --> 10:09.633
DID THEY EVER SHOOT
A HERRING OUT OF A CANNON?

10:19.467 --> 10:21.500
ONLY ONCE.

10:25.233 --> 10:28.033
BUT THEY SHOT HIM
INTO A TREE.

10:29.066 --> 10:32.667
AFTER THAT, NO OTHER
HERRING WOULD DO IT.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.333
YOU'RE MAKING
THIS UP.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.700
I AM NOT!

10:38.767 --> 10:42.200
MY GRANDFATHER
TOLD ME THAT STORY.

10:42.266 --> 10:46.700
OF COURSE,
HE ALSO CALLED ME
BY MY SISTER'S NAME.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.467
AND SOMETIMES
HE'D WEAR HIS UNDERWEAR

10:49.533 --> 10:50.767
ON THE OUTSIDE
OF HIS PANTS.

10:52.734 --> 10:56.400
I GUESS HE WASN'T
A VERY RELIABLE SOURCE.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.734
OH!

11:02.367 --> 11:03.967
OH, GIRLS, GIRLS,

11:04.033 --> 11:07.333
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.033
I'VE BEEN
HAVING FUN,

11:09.100 --> 11:10.800
AND THERE WASN'T
EVEN A MAN
IN THE ROOM.

11:14.033 --> 11:15.467
WAS IT A FLUKE,

11:15.533 --> 11:17.500
OR COULD WE GET ALONG?

11:17.567 --> 11:20.200
WELL, I THINK
IT MIGHT TAKE TIME,

11:20.266 --> 11:22.834
BUT IT COULD
BE WORTH IT.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.100
LET'S TRY!

11:24.166 --> 11:25.100
GREAT!

11:25.166 --> 11:26.633
I'M GAME.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.033
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.200
WHAT'S THAT?

11:35.266 --> 11:36.567
OH, I'M SORRY.

11:36.633 --> 11:39.467
I HAVE THIS
INCREDIBLE SWEET TOOTH.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.867
WHAT IS IT?
CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.900
THIS COULD BE
THE BEGINNING

11:43.967 --> 11:45.700
OF A BEAUTIFUL
FRIENDSHIP.

11:47.734 --> 11:48.867
THIS IS UNHEARD OF.

11:48.934 --> 11:50.567
WE'RE
HALFWAY THROUGH
THE CHEESECAKE

11:50.633 --> 11:52.567
AND HAVEN'T SOLVED
OUR PROBLEM.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.567
MAYBE WE CAN'T
SOLVE IT.

11:54.633 --> 11:57.800
MAYBE MA'S DOING
THE RIGHT THING BY LEAVING.

11:57.867 --> 12:00.600
YOUR BROTHER
IS SUCH A YUTZ!

12:00.667 --> 12:02.800
I JUST PHONED HIM,

12:02.867 --> 12:03.934
AND HE HAD
THE NERVE TO ASK

12:04.000 --> 12:06.166
WHAT'S FOR
DINNER TOMORROW.

12:06.233 --> 12:07.266
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

12:07.333 --> 12:09.467
HE SHOULD HAVE DINNER
WAITING FOR ME.

12:09.533 --> 12:14.233
NOT THAT I'M A FAN
OF SQUIRREL GUMBO.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.033
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO LIVE TOGETHER?

12:17.100 --> 12:18.467
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ARRIVED,

12:18.533 --> 12:19.934
AND ALREADY YOU'RE FIGHTING.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.166
WHAT, THIS IS <i>LITTLE</i>
<i>HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE?</i>

12:22.233 --> 12:25.734
THERE ARE MORE FIGHTS HERE
THAN AT CAESAR'S PALACE.

12:27.333 --> 12:30.166
DOROTHY.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.500
WHERE'S
MY HEATING PAD?

12:32.567 --> 12:34.400
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

12:34.467 --> 12:35.834
IF THIS ISN'T IT,

12:35.900 --> 12:37.367
WHAT OTHER
ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE

12:37.433 --> 12:39.867
ARE YOU USING
UNDER THAT BLANKET?

12:42.066 --> 12:43.367
THERE WE ARE, SOPHIA,

12:43.433 --> 12:44.867
THE PERFECT
AFTER-DINNER TREAT--

12:44.934 --> 12:47.400
A NICE DISH OF JELL-O.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.200
I HATE JELL-O.

12:50.266 --> 12:52.567
IF GOD WANTED PEACHES
SUSPENDED IN MIDAIR,

12:52.633 --> 12:54.767
HE'D HAVE FILLED
THEM WITH HELIUM.

12:58.967 --> 12:59.900
WHAT?

12:59.967 --> 13:02.367
BEAT IT, ROSE.
I'M BUSY.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:03.433 --> 13:04.333
IT'S TUESDAY NIGHT.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.266
I'M CLEANING
MY PURSE.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.567
DID ALL THAT COME
OUT OF YOUR PURSE?

13:09.633 --> 13:12.333
I WAS CLEANING MY EARS.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.567
THAT'S WHERE
THE FEENAMINT

13:13.633 --> 13:16.633
AND THE RAIN BONNET
CAME FROM.

13:16.700 --> 13:20.166
SOPHIA, WHY ARE YOU
IN SUCH A BAD MOOD?

13:20.233 --> 13:22.867
I HAVEN'T HAD SEX
IN 15 YEARS,

13:22.934 --> 13:25.133
AND IT'S STARTING
TO GET ON MY NERVES.

13:28.066 --> 13:29.800
HI, ROSE.

13:29.867 --> 13:31.600
TELL ME, DID YOU GET
A CHANCE TO PLAY AROUND

13:31.667 --> 13:32.800
WITH THOSE LYRICS I GAVE YOU?

13:32.867 --> 13:34.333
YEAH. LISTEN TO THIS.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.033
HEY, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.667
LET'S TAKE IT FROM THE TOP.

13:43.734 --> 13:46.700
FROM THE TOP.
OH, THAT SOUNDS SO MUSICAL.

13:46.767 --> 13:49.934
TICKLE THE IVORIES, ROSE.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.867
COOCHIE, COOCHIE, COO.

13:56.467 --> 13:58.800
ROSE, PLAY OR DIE.

YES, BUT THE LYRICS

WE ONLY FIGHT.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.000
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

15:36.066 --> 15:37.934
WE ALSO TALK
ABOUT SEX.

15:40.533 --> 15:42.367
WE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT SEX.

15:42.433 --> 15:43.834
I'M SHOCKED.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.867
MA, YOU'RE GOING
TO MISS US.

15:47.934 --> 15:50.100
WE HAD SOME
GOOD TIMES.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.834
PLENTY OF HEADACHES TOO.

15:51.900 --> 15:56.500
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
IT'S NEVER DULL
AROUND HERE.

15:59.066 --> 16:00.333
AAH!

16:02.734 --> 16:05.166
YOU SHOT MY VASE.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.633
I HEARD FOOTSTEPS,
A MAN'S VOICE,

16:08.700 --> 16:09.734
AND THE ALARM
WENT OFF.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.467
LESTER ACCIDENTALLY
SET OFF THE ALARM.

16:12.533 --> 16:13.667
I'M SORRY.

16:13.734 --> 16:15.800
YOU SHOT MY VASE.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.233
I DIDN'T SHOOT LESTER.

16:17.300 --> 16:20.400
I'D RATHER
YOU SHOT LESTER.

16:20.467 --> 16:23.467
I THINK I'LL PASS
ON THE NIGHTCAP,
BLANCHE.

16:23.533 --> 16:24.900
GO HOME,
YOU FOOL.

16:24.967 --> 16:25.900
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:25.967 --> 16:27.867
SHE SHOT MY VASE!

16:27.934 --> 16:30.333
THANK GOD.
I HATED THAT THING.

16:32.133 --> 16:34.033
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SHOOTING?

16:34.100 --> 16:35.266
ARE YOU CRAZY?

16:35.333 --> 16:37.467
I HEARD ROBBERS.

16:37.533 --> 16:40.367
I MANAGED TO LIVE
80...81 YEARS.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.867
I SURVIVED PNEUMONIA,
TWO OPERATIONS, A STROKE.

16:43.934 --> 16:45.133
ONE NIGHT I'LL BELCH,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.934
AND STABLE MABEL
WILL BLOW MY HEAD OFF.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.367
THERE'S A MAN
IN YOUR BED.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.700
OH, SOPHIA,
THERE'S NOT.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.000
WHY YOU DEVIL, YOU.

16:59.066 --> 17:02.633
SO THAT WAS
WHAT WE HEARD, ROSE.

17:03.934 --> 17:05.500
ROSE GOT LUCKY.

17:05.567 --> 17:06.867
NOT SO LUCKY.

17:06.934 --> 17:08.200
THE MAN IN YOUR BED
IS DEAD.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.767
WHAT?

17:12.834 --> 17:13.767
DEAD.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.333
OH, SOPHIA.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.100
HE'S NOT DEAD.
I WAS JUST IN THERE.

17:18.166 --> 17:20.567
I PUT BACK
YOUR LAUNDRY.

17:20.633 --> 17:23.233
I SEE HIM,
S0 I INTRODUCE MYSELF.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.834
HE DOESN'T ANSWER.

17:24.900 --> 17:25.867
HE'S DEAD.

17:25.934 --> 17:28.266
HE--HE'S SHY.

17:28.333 --> 17:29.567
HE'S VERY SHY.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.367
DIDN'T SOUND SO SHY
LAST NIGHT.

17:32.433 --> 17:35.033
LET A DEAD GUY LIE THERE.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.633
IT'S GOING TO BE 98 TODAY.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.233
IT WON'T BE PRETTY.

17:40.433 --> 17:43.100
OH, I'M SURE
HE'S NOT DEAD.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.200
ROSE, GO LOOK.

17:44.266 --> 17:47.000
HE'S SLEEPING.
I DON'T WANT
TO WAKE HIM.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.300
LIGHT FIRECRACKERS
IN HIS NOSTRILS.

17:49.367 --> 17:50.900
YOU WON'T WAKE HIM.

17:51.266 --> 17:52.500
BLANCHE DEVEREAUX.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.166
JUST A MOMENT.

18:05.233 --> 18:07.300
OH, MY GOD.

18:10.367 --> 18:12.667
MY REAR TIRES
HAVE LESS PRESSURE
IN THEM.

18:17.233 --> 18:18.367
I'M READY.

18:21.166 --> 18:24.567
THE MOON IS HANGING
AWFUL LOW IN THE SKY,

18:24.633 --> 18:26.166
ISN'T IT, BUSTY?

18:27.100 --> 18:28.166
JOSIE.

18:29.467 --> 18:30.967
IT SURE IS, BIFF.

18:31.033 --> 18:33.367
MAKES ME
WANT TO KISS YOU.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.233
MIND YOUR MANNERS, BIFF.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.400
WE'RE AT
THE JULY 4th PICNIC.

18:37.467 --> 18:38.834
THE WHOLE TOWN'S HERE.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.867
COME AWAY WITH ME.

18:40.934 --> 18:42.567
BUT YOU'RE
A DRIFTER, BIFF.

18:42.633 --> 18:45.367
I CAN'T
JUST PULL UP STAKES.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.333
PLEASE RECONSIDER.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.133
YOU'RE
THE PRETTIEST GIRL
IN THE COUNTY.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.367
I NEED TO HAVE
YOUR ANSWER NOW.

18:51.433 --> 18:53.767
WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE?

18:53.834 --> 18:56.233
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE ME.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.000
[LEAKING AIR]

18:58.066 --> 19:01.867
OH.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.467
BLANCHE, I'M SORRY.

19:09.033 --> 19:11.100
SEE, SOPHIA, WE HAVE
GREAT TIMES TOGETHER.

19:11.166 --> 19:13.834
IT JUST WON'T BE
THE SAME.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.867
THIS ISN'T EASY
FOR ME, EITHER,

19:15.934 --> 19:20.333
BUT I HAVE TO DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.467
WHAT IS IT
I HAVE TO DO?

19:26.967 --> 19:28.734
YOU'RE LEAVING.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.934
THEN I BETTER PACK.

19:34.533 --> 19:37.467
WHAT I'M GOING TO
MISS ABOUT SOPHIA MOST

19:37.533 --> 19:39.400
IS ALL THAT
GOOD ADVICE.

19:39.467 --> 19:42.467
SHE HAS LOTS
TO DRAW ON.

19:42.533 --> 19:45.400
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DRAW ON,

19:45.467 --> 19:46.967
SHE MAKES IT UP.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.633
SICILY, 1912.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.200
PICTURE THIS.

19:51.266 --> 19:52.800
TWO YOUNG GIRLS,

19:52.867 --> 19:55.300
BEST FRIENDS,
WHO SHARED
THREE THINGS...

19:55.367 --> 19:58.800
A PIZZA RECIPE,
SOME DOUGH,
AND A DREAM.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.066
EVERYTHING
IS GOING GREAT,

20:01.133 --> 20:04.233
UNTIL ONE DAY,
A FAST-TALKING
PEPPERONI SALESMAN

20:04.300 --> 20:06.333
GALLOPS INTO TOWN.

20:07.367 --> 20:08.967
OF COURSE, BOTH GIRLS
WERE IMPRESSED.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.200
HE DATES ONE
ONE NIGHT,

20:10.266 --> 20:12.233
THE OTHER
THE NEXT NIGHT.

20:12.300 --> 20:16.867
PRETTY SOON,
HE DRIVES A WEDGE
BETWEEN THEM.

20:16.934 --> 20:18.400
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

20:18.467 --> 20:21.900
THE PIZZA SUFFERS,
THE BUSINESS SUFFERS,
THE FRIENDSHIP SUFFERS.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.867
THE GIRLS PART COMPANY
AND HEAD FOR AMERICA,

20:24.934 --> 20:27.667
NEVER TO SEE
ONE ANOTHER AGAIN.

20:27.734 --> 20:29.400
ROSE...

20:29.467 --> 20:32.367
ONE OF THOSE GIRLS
WAS ME.

20:32.433 --> 20:35.633
THE OTHER ONE
YOU PROBABLY KNOW
AS MAMA CELESTE.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.433
MA, WHY DIDN'T YOU
USE YOUR KEY?

20:41.500 --> 20:43.834
I LEFT IT.
IT WOULD WEIGH ME DOWN.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.200
HOW DID YOU DO?

20:47.266 --> 20:49.367
GREAT. EASILY
A PERSONAL BEST.

20:49.433 --> 20:50.700
TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

20:50.767 --> 20:52.100
IT WAS ELECTRIC.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.066
THE STARTER
FIRED HIS PISTOL,

20:54.133 --> 20:55.233
AND LIKE A SHOT,

20:55.300 --> 20:57.266
I LEFT HALF MY COMPETITION
IN THE DUST.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.967
THAT FAST?

20:59.033 --> 21:00.533
IT WAS
THE OVER 80 CATEGORY.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.600
MOST DROPPED
FROM FRIGHT.

21:04.367 --> 21:06.367
YOU'RE KIDDING.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.667
PLEASE. THERE'S
A NATURAL BUILD
TO THESE STORIES.

21:09.734 --> 21:10.700
SORRY.

21:10.767 --> 21:12.600
SO, FINALLY,

21:12.667 --> 21:14.233
THE RACE WAS UNDERWAY.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.433
I START OFF SLOW.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.433
I'M CAGEY,
LIKE A PANTHER.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.467
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,
I POUNCE.

21:19.533 --> 21:20.834
THE CROWD IS STANDING.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.834
SOPHIA!

21:23.900 --> 21:27.800
MY HEART IS POUNDING
IN MY EARS.

21:27.867 --> 21:30.533
BUT, THEN AGAIN,
IT ALWAYS DOES.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.066
I SAW THE FINISH LINE.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.667
IT WAS 200-300
YARDS AWAY.

21:35.734 --> 21:37.166
THEN IT HAPPENED.

21:37.233 --> 21:38.667
WHAT EVERY RUNNER DREADS.

21:38.734 --> 21:40.767
I HIT THE WALL.

21:40.834 --> 21:43.100
YOU RAN
OUT OF STEAM.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.867
NO. I ACTUALLY
HIT A WALL.

21:45.934 --> 21:47.800
IN SICILY,
WE NEVER WENT
TO THE DOCTOR.

21:47.867 --> 21:49.800
WE WENT
TO WIDOW CARAVELLI.

21:49.867 --> 21:52.967
WHATEVER YOU HAD,
SHE HAD A CURE.

21:53.033 --> 21:56.233
SHE WAS BEST KNOWN
FOR THIS GREEN SALVE

21:56.300 --> 21:58.200
FOR EAR INFECTIONS.

21:58.266 --> 22:00.633
ONE DAY,
SHE GAVE A BATCH
TO SALVADOR,

22:00.700 --> 22:01.700
THE VILLAGE IDIOT.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.333
HE MISUNDERSTOOD
THE DIRECTIONS

22:05.400 --> 22:07.200
AND PUT IT
ON HIS LINGUINE

22:07.266 --> 22:09.066
INSTEAD OF
IN HIS EAR.

22:17.367 --> 22:18.967
I GUESS
IF YOU'RE AN IDIOT

22:19.033 --> 22:20.033
WITH A HEARING PROBLEM,

22:20.100 --> 22:22.633
YOU DO THINGS LIKE THAT.

22:23.367 --> 22:26.400
IT WASN'T SUCH
A BAD THING TO DO.

22:26.467 --> 22:27.967
THE STUFF
TASTED GREAT,

22:28.033 --> 22:30.467
AND SALVADOR DECIDED
TO MARKET IT.

22:30.533 --> 22:33.066
AT FIRST, IT DIDN'T
MOVE SO WELL.

22:33.133 --> 22:35.200
"LINGUINE
WITH EAR SALVE"
ON A MENU

22:35.266 --> 22:37.800
DOESN'T LOOK
TOO APPETIZING.

22:37.867 --> 22:41.934
BUT ONCE HE CHANGED
IT TO "PESTO SAUCE,"

22:42.000 --> 22:43.834
IT MOVED
LIKE HOT CAKES.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.600
YOU'RE MAKING THIS UP.

22:45.667 --> 22:46.834
SO WHAT? I'M OLD.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.467
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE COLORFUL.

22:50.533 --> 22:52.734
I'M GOING
TO MISS HER.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.867
ME TOO.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.300
I'M NOT GOING
TO STAND FOR IT.

22:59.367 --> 23:03.800
I'M TELLING HER
WE NEED HER
MORE THAN PHIL.

23:03.867 --> 23:05.367
FORGET IT.

23:05.433 --> 23:06.767
HER MIND IS MADE UP.

23:06.834 --> 23:09.467
SHE'S SAID IT 100 TIMES.

23:09.533 --> 23:11.967
I'M STAYING. GOOD NIGHT.

23:12.033 --> 23:13.000
WAIT A MINUTE.

23:13.066 --> 23:16.133
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE STAYING?

23:16.200 --> 23:17.133
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.633
YOU ALREADY RENTED
MY ROOM?

23:19.700 --> 23:22.900
WHAT CHANGED
YOUR MIND?

23:22.967 --> 23:27.100
I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE
WITH PHIL'S WIFE.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.166
SHE'S BACK,
POOR THING.

23:28.233 --> 23:30.033
POOR THING?

23:30.100 --> 23:33.667
SHE FOUND OUT
SHE COULDN'T DO
BETTER THAN PHIL.

23:35.166 --> 23:37.133
NOT A STORYBOOK ROMANCE,

23:37.200 --> 23:39.233
BUT AN ENDING'S
AN ENDING.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.900
WE'RE SO GLAD
YOU'RE STAYING.

23:42.967 --> 23:44.367
WHEN WE THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING,

23:44.433 --> 23:46.700
WE STARTED TALKING
ABOUT THE TIMES WE SHARED.

23:46.767 --> 23:49.400
IT BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES.

23:49.467 --> 23:51.667
IT WOULDN'T BE
THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.500
HEY, DON'T
OVER DRAMATIZE.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.633
THINGS AREN'T SO TERRIFIC
AROUND HERE.

23:58.867 --> 23:59.900
THE HELL THEY'RE NOT.

23:59.967 --> 24:01.433
THINGS ARE TERRIFIC
AROUND HERE!
