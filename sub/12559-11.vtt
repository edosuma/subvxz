02:07.753 --> 02:09.118
WELL...

02:09.170 --> 02:11.378
FIRST OF ALL,
I HAD BREAKFAST.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.876
THEN I HAD LUNCH,

02:12.966 --> 02:15.799
AND THEN I FIRED
THE STUPID MAID.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.342
AND THEN--

02:17.429 --> 02:19.670
I WAITED FOR YOU,
HARMON, DEAR.

02:19.765 --> 02:23.349
SO, ALL IN ALL, I'D SAY
IT VVAS ONE OF THOSE DAYS

02:23.435 --> 02:27.019
THAT MADE YOU SIMPLY VVANT
TO GO AND JUMP OFF A BRIDGE.

02:30.484 --> 02:36.696

SMOKY THE BEAR.

BIG DADDY, ONE OF THESE
LONG, LATE NIGHTS,

THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

<i>WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,</i>

VVHY DON'T YOU PICK UP THE
REMNANTS OF THAT AGED EYESORE

02:54.091 --> 02:56.674
THAT I SO HAPPILY KNOCKED
OVER A FEVV MINUTES AGO?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.892
<i>THIS CAME
FROM MY MOTHER.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:08.935
IT'S A VERY OLD
PIECE, FLORA.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.228
OH?

03:10.315 --> 03:11.692
WORTH WHAT?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.895

I'LL GO OUT AND BUY
YOU SIX OF THEM.

THEN I'LL TAKE THEM
ALL TO THE DIME STORE

SOMETHING LIKE, UH, "COME
TO THE WILDWOOD CHURCH"?

03:32.587 --> 03:35.249
AND OTHER SUCH RED-HOT
TOE-TAPPING NUMBERS?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.377
IT'S WORTH VERY LITTLE

03:37.467 --> 03:39.378
EXCEPT...

03:39.428 --> 03:41.465
EXCEPT FOR
SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.764
THAT'S A WORD YOU MAY
NOT UNDERSTAND, "SENTIMENT."

03:44.850 --> 03:46.887
IT MEANS "THE
CAPACITY TO LOVE."

03:46.977 --> 03:50.766
BIG DADDY, IF I
DON'T FILL THE BILL,

03:50.856 --> 03:52.972
VVHY DON'T YOU JUST
SAY SO RIGHT OUT?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.568
SHOULD YOU FAIL
TO KNOW IT

03:54.651 --> 03:56.483
THERE ARE 14 FLIGHTS
A DAY TO RENO,

03:56.570 --> 03:59.483
AND I VVOULD JUST ADORE
TO BE ON ANY ONE OF THEM.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.484
FLORA, I'M, UH--

04:01.575 --> 04:05.068
I'M NOT ANGRY, I JUST VVISH
THAT YOU VVOULD, YOU VVOULD...

04:05.162 --> 04:08.405
YOU WOULD TRY
TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

04:08.457 --> 04:11.415
SOMEBODY SHOULD HA\/E VVISHED
THAT Fl\/E YEARS AGO

04:11.501 --> 04:13.162
WHEN WE TOOK OUT
OUR PAPERS.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.961
OH, I KNEW YOU
WERE OLD, HARMON.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.834
IJUST DIDN'T
KNOW HOW OLD.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.178
YOU BETTER BE
CAREFUL, BIG DADDY,

04:21.261 --> 04:25.255
BECAUSE IF YOU EVER TAKE ME TO
A SVVINGING VVEEKEND IN EGYPT,

04:25.348 --> 04:29.433
I JUST MAY RUN AVVAY
VVITH A MUMMY.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.594
I'LL, UH--

04:31.688 --> 04:34.020
I'LL JUST WASH UP
AND WE'LL GO TO DINNER.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.939
YEAH.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.438
YOU DO JUST THAT.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.439
WE'LL MAKE IT YOUR NIGHT.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.275
WE'LL DO SOMETHING
REALLY WILD

04:42.365 --> 04:45.027
<i>LIKE GO TO A BAND
CONCERT IN THE PARK.</i>

04:50.957 --> 04:52.789
<i>(narrator) A PICTURE
OF AN AGING MAN</i>

04:52.834 --> 04:54.620
<i>WHO LEADS HIS LIFE

04:54.669 --> 04:56.706
<i>IN QUIET DESPERATION.</i>

04:56.797 --> 05:00.040
<i>BECAUSE HARMON GORDON IS
ENSLAVED BYA LOVE AFFAIR</i>

05:00.133 --> 05:02.545
<i>WITH A WIFE
4O YEARS HIS JUNIOR.</i>

05:02.636 --> 05:05.549
BECAUSE OF THIS, HE RUNS
VVHEN HE SHOULD VVALK,

05:05.639 --> 05:09.052
HE SURRENDERS VVHEN SIMPLE
PRIDE DICTATES A STAND.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.351
HE PINES AVVAY FOR THE
LOST MORNING OF HIS LIFE

05:12.437 --> 05:14.519
WHEN HE SHOULD BE
ENJOYING THE EVENING.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.849
IN SHORT, MR. HARMON GORDON
SEEKS A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.105
AND WHO'S TO SAY
HE WON'T FIND IT?

05:20.195 --> 05:22.812
THIS HAPPENS TO BE
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.590
[sarcastically]
OH, GREAT.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.964
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO RUN THE MILE,

05:46.054 --> 05:48.967
<i>JUST TO GO DANCING OR
THE MOVIES OR SOMETHING.</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:53.392
<i>AND DON'T START TELLING ME ABOUT HOW
YOU TOOK ME OUT OF A CHORUS LINE</i>

05:53.478 --> 05:56.391
<i>AND INTRODUCED ME
TO THE FINER THINGS.</i>

05:56.481 --> 05:58.768
<i>YOUR IDEA OF
THE FINER THINGS</i>

05:58.859 --> 06:04.195
<i>IS TO HOLD HANDS IN A MAUSOLEUM
AND LISTEN TO THE ORGAN MUSIC.</i>

06:04.281 --> 06:08.525
VVELL, GET YOURSELF A NICE, TALL
GLASS OF VVARM MILK, BIG DADDY,

06:08.618 --> 06:10.609
AND CURL UP
WITH AN ALMANAC,

06:10.704 --> 06:14.242
'CAUSE WE WANT
YOU HAPPY, DON'T WE?

<i>[door slams]</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:23.964
YES, THANK YOU.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.634

06:27.721 --> 06:29.007
UH, RAYMOND?

06:29.097 --> 06:30.758
IT'S HARMON.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.433
RAYMOND, I'VE GOT
TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT.

06:34.519 --> 06:38.979
WOULD YOU PLEASE COME OVER?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.726
UH, DRINK ALL RIGHT?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.979
UH, YEAH,
IT'S FINE.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.661
YOU LOOK A
LITTLE TIRED, HARMON.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.119
WELL, I'VE BEEN, UH...

07:01.212 --> 07:04.421
A LITTLE RUSHED
THIS PAST WEEK, SO...

07:04.466 --> 07:06.332
FLORA IN BED?

07:06.426 --> 07:09.669
UH, YES, YES,
SHE WENT TO BED.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.549
SHE ASKED TO
BE REMEMBERED.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.223
OH, SHE'LL BE REMEMBERED.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.767
<i>YOU OUGHT TO GET TO KNOW
HER BETTER, RAYMOND.</i>

07:16.811 --> 07:21.100
SHE'S REALLY...
SHE'S REALLY A VERY FINE GIRL.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.977
DID I SAY OTHERWISE?

07:23.068 --> 07:26.106
VVELL, I KNOVV YOU TVVO
HAVEN'T BEEN EXACTLY CLOSE,

07:26.154 --> 07:27.690
CERTAINLY NOT AS CLOSE

07:27.781 --> 07:30.398
AS A BROTHER- AND
SISTER-IN-LAW COULD BE.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.565
HARMON...

07:31.660 --> 07:33.492
WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.194
CERTAIN LY.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.154
AS A MATTER OF
FACT, TWO FAVORS.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.330
<i>FIRST, DON'T TRY
TO SELL ME FLORA.</i>

07:39.417 --> 07:41.408
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK OF HER,</i>

07:41.503 --> 07:43.335
I'VE TOLD HER
MYSELF TO HER FACE

07:43.421 --> 07:46.288
SO I HA\/E NO COMPUNCTIONS
ABOUT SAYING IT ALOUD.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.375
I THINK SHE'S A BRASSY,
CONNIVING, COVETOUS LITTLE BROAD.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.335
<i>LET ME FINISH.</i>

07:51.429 --> 07:53.887
I COULD FORGIVE HER
HER HUNGERS, HARMON,

07:53.974 --> 07:56.932
I COULD FORGIVE HER THE FACT
THAT SHE'S MADE OUT OF ASBESTOS

07:57.018 --> 07:59.055
AND HASN'T GOT
A HEART IN HER BODY.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.887
BUT I CAN'T FORGIVE HER FOR
VVHAT SHE'S DONE TO YOU.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.939
<i>YOU KNOW THAT
SHE'S TURNED YOU</i>

08:04.025 --> 08:07.518
<i>INTO A FRIGHTENED,
QUAKING FOOL.</i>

08:07.612 --> 08:09.899
YOU DOTE ON HER,
YOU GIVE IN TO HER,

08:09.990 --> 08:11.981
YOU RUN AFTER
HER LIKE A POODLE.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.407
<i>THAT'S ITEM
NUMBER ONE.</i>

08:14.494 --> 08:16.155
NOW THE SECOND
FAVOR IS THAT--

08:16.246 --> 08:19.910
<i>FROM NOW ON, AFTER
YOU'VE HAD YOUR BATTLES,</i>

08:20.000 --> 08:22.492
DON'T CALL ME AT ODD
HOURS OF THE NIGHT.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.498
WELL, I DON'T DO
THAT VERY OFTEN.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.171
ONCE IS OFTEN
AND TWICE IS ENDLESS.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.421
<i>HARMON, WE'RE VERY
CLOSE AS BROTHERS GO.</i>

08:31.511 --> 08:34.094
YOU KNOVV THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.514
BUT I CAN'T CONTINUE TO RUN
OVER HERE LIKE A SAINT BERNARD

08:37.600 --> 08:41.264
EVERY TIME YOU GET FROZEN
HALFVVAY UP THE MOUNTAINSIDE.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.096
<i>NOW, SHE'S A PREDATORY
LITTLE ALLEY CAT.</i>

08:44.190 --> 08:47.353
<i>AND SHE'S AL WA Y8
BEEN THA T WA Y.</i>

08:47.444 --> 08:50.937
I CAN JUST GIVE YOU SO MUCH
SOLACE, SO MUCH SYMPATHY,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.524
AND AFTER THAT,
IT BEGINS TO CRAW.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.528
NOW, WHAT
IS IT TONIGHT?

08:56.619 --> 08:59.611
JUST SOMEONE TO WHILE
AWAY THE HOURS WITH

08:59.706 --> 09:01.697
OR IS THERE SOMETHING
QUITE SPECIFIC?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.376
UM...

09:11.468 --> 09:14.586
UM...

09:14.679 --> 09:17.057
THIS THING YOU, UH...

BEEN WORKING ON.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.970
GO ON.

09:21.061 --> 09:25.146
THE CELLULAR SERUM... YOU'VE
BEEN SUCCESSFUL VVITH IT.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.222
YOU MUST BE OUT
OF YOUR MIND.

09:27.317 --> 09:31.231
I'M DESPERATE, YES, BUT
I'M NOT OUT OF MY MIND.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.029
<i>YOU'VE MADE ANIMALS YOUNGER,
I'VE SEEN IT MYSELF.</i>

09:34.074 --> 09:36.941
YOU INJECT THEM VVITH YOUR
FLUID AND THEY'RE YOUNG AGAIN.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.446
ANIMALS, YES.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.447
GUINEA PIGS,
WHITE MICE, HAMSTERS.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.950
<i>I'VE BEEN ABLE TO REJUVENATE
GLAND-S, ORGAN-S,</i>

09:43.041 --> 09:45.248
<i>SOMETIMES A COMPLETE
CELLULAR STRUCTURE.</i>

09:45.335 --> 09:47.246
BUT WE HAVEN'T
SCRATCHED THE SURFACE,

09:47.337 --> 09:48.827
<i>WE'RE STUMBLING
IN THE DARK.</i>

09:48.922 --> 09:50.708
I WANT YOU TO INJECT ME.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.915
YOU DON'T HAVE A REMOTE
IDEA OF VVHAT'S INVOLVED.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.629
VVE'RE 2O YEARS AVVAY FROM
TRYING THIS ON A HUMAN BEING.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.256
WHY?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.179
<i>WE'RE DEALING
IN BASIC LIFE FORM.</i>

09:59.265 --> 10:02.428
VVE HA\/E NO IDEA OF HOVV
MUCH DAMAGE MIGHT RESULT.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.602
VVE DON'T KNOVV HOVV IT'S GONNA
AFFECT THE BASIC METABOLISM

10:05.688 --> 10:09.181
OF THE BODY OR THE MIND,
OR THE EFFECT ON THE BRAIN.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.518
VVE'RE VVINGING THIS, VVE'\/E
KILLED AS MANY AS VVE'\/E SAVED.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.525
YOU SAID YOU'D DO
ANYTHING FOR ME.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.526
ANYTHING WITHIN REASON.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.279
OH, BUT THIS IS
WITHIN REASON.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.361
I'VE COME CLOSE TO
THE END OF MY ROPE.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.947
I'M AT THE POINT VVHERE IT
MATTERS VERY LITTLE TO ME

10:24.999 --> 10:26.501
WHETHER I LIVE OR DIE.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.837
I WANT YOU TO TEST
THIS SERUM ON ME,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.706
MAKE ME YOUNG AGAIN.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.835
NOVV, SHORT OF THAT, I DON'T
VVANT TO GET ANY OLDER.

10:33.925 --> 10:36.917
ASIDE FROM THIS PRONOUNOED
DEATH VVISH OF YOURS,

10:37.011 --> 10:40.094
HOVV VVOULD YOU LIKE TO
SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

10:40.181 --> 10:41.967
AS A MUTATED FREAK?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.765
<i>OR A GIBBERING IDIOT?</i>

10:43.852 --> 10:46.264
<i>OR A MINDLESS SHELL?</i>

10:46.354 --> 10:49.346
THAT'S NOT ONLY POSSIBLE,
IT'S HIGHLY PROBABLE.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.728
VVE CAN'T CONTROL AN
EXPERIMENT ON A HUMAN BEING.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.981
IT WOULD BE CATCH
AS CATCH CAN.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.405
I'D NOT ONLY TAKE THE
RISK, I'D VVELCOME IT.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.358
THE ANSWER IS NO!

11:01.452 --> 11:04.035
I WOULDN'T EXPERIMENT
ON A STRANGE BUM

11:04.122 --> 11:05.533

12:01.137 --> 12:02.218
HARMON.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.230
AS A DOCTOR,
I CAN TELL YOU

12:14.317 --> 12:16.228
WHAT THE EFFECTS
ON THE HUMAN BODY ARE

12:16.319 --> 12:19.812
LANDING ON CONCRETE AT THE
END OF A 500-FOOT FALL.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.238
WELL, AS A MAN,
CAN YOU TELL ME

12:22.283 --> 12:25.241
WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE
ON THE HUMAN BRAIN

12:25.286 --> 12:28.244
WHEN A MAN
IS DEEPLY, TOTALLY

12:28.289 --> 12:30.997
AND DEDICATEDLY
IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN

12:31.084 --> 12:33.371
WHO CAN'T STAND
THE SIGHT OF HIM?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.043
HAVE YOU EVEN
THE REMOTEST IDEA

12:35.129 --> 12:38.087
WHAT KIND OF LIFE
THIS IS FOR ME?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.006
I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT IT COULD BE...

12:40.093 --> 12:41.879
OR WHAT IT
SHOULD BE.

12:41.970 --> 12:46.510
YOU'RE A BRIGHT, CHARMING,
WEALTHY, DISCERNING GUY,

12:46.599 --> 12:48.590
YOU'VE BEEN
HAMMERED OUT OF SHAPE

12:48.643 --> 12:51.601
BY A FLASHY PIECE OF BAGGAGE
NOT FIT TO WAIT ON YOUR TABLE.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.853
WELL, WHATEVER
SHE IS OR ISN'T,

12:53.940 --> 12:55.681
SHE IS THE ONLY THING
ON GOD'S EARTH

12:55.775 --> 12:58.312
THAT I
CARE ABOUT.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.111
I BEG YOU,
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.987
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO SAVE MYSELF.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.781
AND IF I DON'T?

13:04.867 --> 13:08.201
THEN VVE'LL SEE VVHO REACHES
THE SIDEVVALK FIRST:

13:08.288 --> 13:12.748
THE MAN IN THE ELEVATOR
OR THE FREE-FALLING BODY.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.294
OH, MY DEAR GOD.

13:21.384 --> 13:25.469
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

13:25.555 --> 13:29.298
LET ME THINK IT OVER
FOR AN HOUR OR TWO.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.008
I'LL COME BACK.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.902
IS THAT IT?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.358
THAT'S IT.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.083
WHAT CAN I EXPECT?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.707
YOU CAN EXPECT A MIRACLE,

13:59.797 --> 14:02.255
BUT YOU'RE NOT VERY
LIKELY TO GET IT.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.004
GO TO BED NOW, DON'T
GO TO WORK TOMORROW.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.919
I'LL BE HERE
EARLY IN THE MORNING.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.051
I VVANT TO BE VERY CLOSE TO
YOU FOR THE NEXT FEVV DAYS.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.758
WELL, WHEN CAN I
EXPECT SOME CHANGE?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.513
WITHIN SIX HOURS.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.845
THAT'S WHEN THE FIRST
PHYSICAL CHANGE IS NOTED.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.263
AS FOR THE
MENTAL CHANGE,

14:18.358 --> 14:20.065
NONE OF THE RATS
OR GUINEA PIGS

14:20.151 --> 14:21.858
HAVE TOLD ME
WHAT THE FEELING WAS.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.526
I'LL BE THE FIRST.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.524
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST...

14:25.573 --> 14:28.440
ASSUMING THAT
YOU SURVIVE.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.447
YOU WANT TO KNOW
SOMETHING, RAYMOND?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.790
I'M NOT ONLY
GOING TO SURVIVE,

14:33.873 --> 14:37.366
I'M GOING TO BE YOUNG
AGAIN, I CAN FEEL IT.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.623
I WONDER IF SHE HAS ANY
IDEA WHAT SHE'S DONE.

14:40.713 --> 14:46.550
EVEN ONE SLIGHT
LITTLE SUSPICION.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.593
BUT I PROMISE YOU

14:48.679 --> 14:51.967
THAT IF YOU DON'T SURVIVE OR
IF YOU'RE DAMAGED IN ANY VVAY,

14:52.058 --> 14:54.550
I'M GOING TO TAKE IT
OUT OF HER SKIN,

14:54.644 --> 14:56.100
PIECE BY PIECE.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.677
SHE'S GOING TO DONATE
A PINT OF BLOOD

14:57.772 --> 14:59.638
FOR EVERY PINT
SHE'S BLED OUT OF YOU.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.724
AND THAT'S NOT A MEDICAL
HYPOTHESIS, THAT'S A PROMISE.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.313
GO TO BED NOW.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.520
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.808
[knocking at door]

15:51.534 --> 15:53.195
[groan]

15:53.286 --> 15:56.620
WELL, WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE POOR MAN'S KILDARE.

15:56.664 --> 16:01.625
VVHAT BRINGS YOU OUT INTO
THE EARLY DAVVN, DOCTOR?

16:01.669 --> 16:03.706
WHERE'S HARMON?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.174
VVHEN LAST SEEN, HE VVAS
POUNDING A PILLOVV.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.123
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

16:08.176 --> 16:10.634
WHAT IS THIS,
E.S.P. OR SOMETHING?

16:10.678 --> 16:13.466
IASKED YOU A QUESTION--
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

16:13.514 --> 16:15.972
I PRESUME HE IS,
BUT IF YOU DON'T THINK SO

16:16.017 --> 16:18.008
JUST GO IN THERE
AND BLOW A BUGLE.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.638
NO, I'LL WAIT
FOR HIM TO GET UP.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.473
YEAH, YOU DO THAT.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.807
TAKE OFF YOUR STETHOSCOPE
AND MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.907
HAVEN'T YOU TALKED
TO HIM THIS MORNING?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.905
<i>I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO ANYBODY.</i>

16:36.996 --> 16:39.033
<i>THAT IS, UNTIL YOU SAW
FIT TO COME POUNDING</i>

16:39.123 --> 16:40.830
AT THE DOOR
AT THIS UNGODLY HOUR.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.457
DID YOU TALK
TO HIM LAST NIGHT?

16:42.543 --> 16:44.045
HE SAID SOMETHING
WHEN HE WENT TO BED.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.539
I DIDN'T
HARDLY HEAR HIM.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.998
HE SOUNDED
LUCID TO YOU?

16:50.092 --> 16:52.925
LOOK, PALLY, I'M
NOT THE NIGHT NURSE.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.844
ITHINK YOU'RE
IN THE WRONG WARD.

16:54.889 --> 17:01.431
BESIDES THAT,
YOU BORE ME.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.852
[door opens]

17:06.025 --> 17:07.481
HOW DO YOU
FEEL, HARMON?

17:07.568 --> 17:09.104
[mocking] HOW DO
YOU FEEL, HARMON?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.981
I ASK FOR \/INOE EDWARDS AND
LOOK VVHAT THEY SEND ME.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.000
AH, IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP

17:29.048 --> 17:30.709
WILL DO FOR
A MAN, ISN'T IT?

17:34.095 --> 17:36.883
HARMON?

17:36.973 --> 17:38.429
WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE--?

17:38.516 --> 17:39.802
ARE YOU
WEARING MAKEUP?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.724
MAKEUP... NO, NO.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.931
NO MAKEUP, JUST
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.308
WELL...

17:46.399 --> 17:47.730
YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.433
OH, DO I?

17:49.527 --> 17:51.109
YES, YOU...

17:51.195 --> 17:53.232
WELL, YOU LOOK
WONDERFUL, YOU--

17:53.322 --> 17:54.983
YOU LOOK
SO YOUNG.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.235
[laughing]

17:56.325 --> 17:57.577
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO YOU?

17:57.660 --> 17:59.401
ASK MY BROTHER
OVER THERE.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.408
NO, HIS BROTHER
DOESN'T KNOW.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.239
HOW <i>DO</i> YOU FEEL,
HARMON?

18:04.292 --> 18:07.501
I FEEL LIKE A MILLION
DOLLARS TAX-FREE,

18:07.587 --> 18:08.918
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.336
KNOW WHAT I'LL DO
FOR YOU, RAY?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.164
I'LL LET YOU
TAKE ME ON TOUR.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.340
THEY'LL VVRITE YOU UP IN
ALL THE MEDICAL JOURNALS.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.169
BUT FIRST YOU'VE GOT TO
GIVE ME FOUR VVEEKS.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.925
FLORA AND I ARE GOING TO
GO ON A LITTLE OOEAN TRIP.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.347
AN OCEAN TRIP?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.765
MM-HMM.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.934
WELL...WELL,
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.600
WHEN DO WE GO?

18:28.691 --> 18:30.602
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.855
VVE OUGHT TO CHECK IF THERE'S
ANYTHING SAILING TONIGHT.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.777
UNLESS OF COURSE
YOU'D RATHER FLY.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.027
OH, FLY, SAIL,
WHO CARES?

18:38.117 --> 18:41.030
OOH, BIG DADDY, I DON'T KNOVV
VVHAT YOU'\/E DONE TO YOURSELF

18:41.120 --> 18:42.702
BUT LET ME CLUE YOU IN
ABOUT SOMETHING:

18:42.788 --> 18:44.654
I DON'T CARE,
'CAUSE I LIKE THIS FINE.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.706
OH, YES, I LIKE IT FINE.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.035
I DON'T VVANT YOU TO PLAN ANY
TRIPS FOR QUITE A VVHILE.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.166
OH, BLOW IT.

18:52.256 --> 18:56.124
I'LL JUST GO AND CHANGE
FOR YOU, ALL RIGHT?

18:56.218 --> 18:57.879
<i>(Harmon) WHERE'D YOU LIKE TO GO?</i>

18:57.970 --> 19:00.302
<i>PARIS? ROME?
TOKYO? HM?</i>

19:00.348 --> 19:02.840
ANYWHERE YOU SAY.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.469
I'M YOUR PASSENGER.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.183
OH...

19:09.273 --> 19:12.015
MM,AH...

19:18.908 --> 19:20.865
WHY, THIS IS
INCREDIBLE.

19:20.951 --> 19:24.660
YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED THAT WAY
SINCE YOU WERE 3O YEARS OLD.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.414
THAT'S FANTASTIC,
IT'S ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.833
I KEEP
GETTING YOUNGER.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.332
IF I KEEP GOING AT THIS
RATE, I'LL BE DRAFTED.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.917
[laughing]

19:35.007 --> 19:37.419
IF YOU DON'T STOP,
WE MAY BE IN TROUBLE.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.750
OH!

19:38.844 --> 19:40.755
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, TROUBLE?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.177
I WISH I KNEW...

19:42.264 --> 19:43.675
HOW MUCH LONGER
IT WOULD GO ON

19:43.766 --> 19:46.428
OR HOW LONG
BEFORE IT STOPS.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.510
OH, IT'S STILL
GOING ON.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.062
I CAN FEEL IT.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.684
HARMON?

19:52.775 --> 19:55.107
IT'S STILL GOING ON,
WHAT... WHAT IS...

19:55.194 --> 19:56.229
OH...

19:56.320 --> 19:57.856
HARMON?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.191
WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH YOU?

19:59.281 --> 20:00.897
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

20:00.991 --> 20:01.901
[gasps]

20:01.992 --> 20:03.198
LEAVE HIM GO.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.320
IWANT HIM
TO GO TO BED.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.323
GO TO BED, HARMON.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.530
<i>(Flora) YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM.</i>

20:08.582 --> 20:09.959
BE QUIET,
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

20:10.042 --> 20:11.032
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.242
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

20:23.097 --> 20:24.303
WHAT IS IT?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.222
SIT DOWN, FLORA.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.383
BUT I WANT TO SEE HIM.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.933
YOU WILL.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.397
BUT I DON'T VVANT
YOU TO VVAKE HIM.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.982
HE'S IN SHOCK NOW,

20:33.065 --> 20:34.567
AND SLEEP IS PRECISELY
WHAT HE NEEDS.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.814
IWANNA SEE
HIM RIGHT NOW.

20:35.901 --> 20:36.982
YOU WILL.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.855
BUT RIGHT NOW, FLORA,

20:38.946 --> 20:41.483
AS OF THIS MOMENT, YOU'VE
GOT TO READJUST YOUR LIFE.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.487
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.238
LOOK, IS THIS SOME
KIND OF A TRICK?

20:46.328 --> 20:47.989
IWANT TO
SEE MY HUSBAND.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.617
YOUR HUSBAND
IS SLEEPING.

20:50.708 --> 20:54.246
VVHEN HE VVAKES UP, HE'S
GOING TO NEED HELP.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.918
HELP?

20:56.005 --> 20:58.417
WHAT KIND OF HELP?

20:58.507 --> 20:59.668
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.171
YOU WILL.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.468
BUT I THINK YOU'D
BEST GET ORIENTED.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.995
FLORA, THE GROUND
RULES CHANGE NOW.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.827
NOW YOU STAY
IN YOUR OWN YARD.

21:37.922 --> 21:41.290
THE VVORLD DOESN'T BEGIN AND
END VVITH FLORA ANYMORE.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.842
IT ISN'T JUST FLORA'S WISHES
AND FLORA'S TEMPERAMENT,

21:44.929 --> 21:46.966
AND FLORA'S
CAPACITY FOR ANGER.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.177
NOW IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.884
YOU HAVE A
RESPONSIBILITY NOW.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.015
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO HONOR IT.

21:55.105 --> 21:58.473
YOU'RE GOING TO
TAKE CARE OF HARMON.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.399
HE'S GOING TO NEED YOU.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.737
[gurgling]

22:08.828 --> 22:11.320
<i>(Raymond)
FLORA!</i>

22:11.413 --> 22:12.949
FLORA!

22:13.040 --> 22:15.577
IF YOU'RE LEAVING,
MAKE NOTE OF THE FACT

22:15.668 --> 22:18.035
THAT VVHAT YOU'RE VVEARING IS
ALL THAT YOU TAKE VVITH YOU.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.960
IF YOU THINK THAT
I'M GONNA STAY

22:20.047 --> 22:21.833
AND TAKE CARE OF A GRUBBY,
THUMB-SUCKING KID--

22:21.882 --> 22:24.920
THAT'S PRECISELY
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.422
AND SHORT OF THAT,

22:27.513 --> 22:30.847
YOU LEAVE HERE
EXACTLY AS YOU ARRIVED:

22:30.891 --> 22:32.598
UNADORNED.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.767
ALL THE FURS
AND THE JEWELRY

22:34.854 --> 22:37.095
<i>AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT
MY BROTHER GAVE YOU--</i>

22:37.189 --> 22:38.429
<i>REMAIN HERE.</i>

22:38.524 --> 22:39.980
HE CAN'T MAKE
ME STAY HERE.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.683
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME
STAY HERE, EITHER.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.563
THERE ARE OTHER FISH
IN THIS OCEAN, MISTER.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.270
BUT YOU'RE NOT
MARRIED TO THEM.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.355
YOU HAPPEN TO BE
MARRIED TO MY BROTHER.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.611
THAT'S CRAZY.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.692
CRAZY?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.197
NO. IT'S BIZARRE.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.824
AND IT'S A FACT.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.621
AND IF I EVER HEAR
THAT HE'S LEFT ALONE

22:55.708 --> 22:57.540
WITH NURSES, MAIDS
AND GOVERNESSES,

22:57.585 --> 23:00.202
YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOURSELF
BACK ON THE CHORUS LINE.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.878
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

23:01.964 --> 23:05.047
<i>HE'S GONNA GET
SOME ATTENTION NOW.</i>

23:05.134 --> 23:07.717
<i>AND I DON'T MEAN JUST
INTIMATE AND SPORADIC VISITS</i>

23:07.803 --> 23:10.044
<i>BETWEEN NIGHTCLUBS
AND BEAUTY PARLORS.</i>

23:10.139 --> 23:12.221
<i>I MEAN FROM
MORNING TILL NIGHT.</i>

23:12.308 --> 23:16.302
[gurgling]

23:16.395 --> 23:18.227
WON'T HE EVER GROW?

23:18.314 --> 23:20.180
OH, YES.

23:20.274 --> 23:23.141
AS OF RIGHT NOW, HE'LL GROW
A LITTLE BIT OLDER EACH DAY,

23:23.235 --> 23:24.942
LIKE ANY LITTLE BOY.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.737
<i>AND YOU'LL PERFORM
THE PROCESS TOGETHER.</i>

23:27.823 --> 23:31.282
<i>AS HE GROWS OLDER,
YOU'LL BE GROWING OLD.</i>

23:31.368 --> 23:33.780
THERE'S A LITTLE
POETIC JUSTICE, FLORA:

23:33.871 --> 23:36.829
THAT YOU SHOULD BE FORCED
TO DRINK FROM THE SAME CUP.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.827
<i>AND THEN WHEN
TOMORROW COMES,</i>

23:38.918 --> 23:41.910
<i>THERE'LL BE SOMEONE
YOUNGER OUTSIDE</i>

23:42.004 --> 23:44.086
<i>WAITING TO COME IN.</i>

23:44.173 --> 23:47.416
<i>ALWAYS WAITING
TO COME IN.</i>

23:47.509 --> 23:50.752
BUT IT ISN'T
FAIR, RAYMOND.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.759
IT JUST ISN'T FAIR.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.760
EVERYTHING...

23:55.851 --> 23:59.014
EVERYTHING IS
ON HIS SIDE.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.141
WELL, YOU SEE, FLORA,

24:01.231 --> 24:04.769
AS YOU GET OLDER,
SEE HOW WISE YOU GET.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.355
<i>(narrator)
IT HAPPENS TO BE A FACT.</i>

24:07.446 --> 24:10.359
<i>AS ONE GETS OLDER,
ONE DOES GET WISER.</i>

24:10.449 --> 24:12.440
<i>IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT,
ASK FLORA.</i>

24:12.534 --> 24:15.777
<i>ASK HER ANY DAY OF THE
ENSUING WEEKS OF HER LIFE</i>

24:15.871 --> 24:18.613
<i>AS SHE TAKES NOTES
DURING THE COMING YEARS</i>

24:18.707 --> 24:20.789
<i>AND REALIZES THAT
THE WORM HAS TURNED.</i>

24:20.876 --> 24:23.038
<i>YOUTH HAS TAKEN OVER.</i>

24:23.128 --> 24:25.540
<i>IT'S SIMPLY THE WAY
THE CALENDAR CRUMBLES...</i>

24:25.631 --> 24:29.795
<i>IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.</i>

24:29.885 --> 24:32.001
