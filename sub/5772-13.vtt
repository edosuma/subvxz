WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:03.404
(Mindy)
I'm not going to lie.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.239
Dating long distance
can stink.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.109
You don't have a boyfriend
to help you around the house...

00:08.142 --> 00:09.377
[grunts]

00:09.410 --> 00:10.611
[screams]

00:10.644 --> 00:12.080
[panting]

00:16.650 --> 00:18.819
But at least modern technology
makes it easier to forget

00:18.852 --> 00:21.689
that he's an ocean away
in New York.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.658
But it doesn't help you forget
that every woman in Manhattan

00:24.692 --> 00:26.560
probably wants
to jump his bones.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.196
[phone chimes]
Hey.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.130
Hey, sugar, what's shaking?

00:29.163 --> 00:31.832
Since we last spoke an hour ago,
not much.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.033
I've got to go see a patient.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.436
Well, be careful, because
pregnant women are very strong,

00:35.469 --> 00:37.138
and they're very horny.

00:37.171 --> 00:37.971
Did you get the whistle
I sent you?

00:38.005 --> 00:39.707
Yeah, I got it right here.
Hi.
Hi.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.309
I need to hear it.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.779
[blows whistle]

00:45.813 --> 00:47.415
Great.
Have a great day.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.782
[phone chimes]
Hey, babe.

00:48.816 --> 00:49.583
Hey, sugar, what's shaking?

00:49.617 --> 00:51.285
I can't really talk right now.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.286
I'm late for Terry at the gym.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.756
The gym? Who do you need
to go to the gym for?

00:55.789 --> 00:58.392
I, for one, am completely
letting myself slide.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.128
[whispers] Even the Hispanic
guys have stopped catcalling me.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.729
Yeah, that's great, babe.
I really got to go.

01:01.762 --> 01:02.830
Bye.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.699
[phone chiming]

01:05.733 --> 01:06.700
Hey, babe.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.169
Hey, sugar, what's shaking?

01:08.202 --> 01:09.737
I'm just waiting
for a prescription.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.439
For what? Gonorrhea medicine?
What? No.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.540
I don't have gonorrhea.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.841
If anything,
I have an ear infection

01:13.874 --> 01:15.276
from talking on the phone
all the time.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.844
Look, you got to stop worrying

01:16.877 --> 01:18.546
about these cougars
ripping me to shreds.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.549
I'm sorry, Danny.
Just, I miss you so much, and...

01:21.582 --> 01:23.351
you look so cute
in that gray sweater.

01:23.384 --> 01:26.154
Thanks, babe,
that's really--

01:26.187 --> 01:28.256
Wait a minute,
how'd you know I--

01:28.289 --> 01:29.423
Oh, my God,
I've been compromised.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.792
Mission abort.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.628
[screams]

01:34.662 --> 01:35.696
Love you! Bye!

01:35.729 --> 01:38.699
[hip-hop music]

01:38.732 --> 01:40.268
*

01:40.301 --> 01:42.303
(Mindy)
Hey, babe, tell me everything.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.238
What's going on?
Did Morgan find his kite?

01:44.272 --> 01:45.639
Hey, did that bear claw guy
asked about me?

01:45.673 --> 01:47.074
He's not responding
to my emails.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.410
Sweetheart, you can't spend
your whole time in California

01:49.443 --> 01:50.544
talking to me on the phone.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.580
You're in a new place.
Go experience it.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.382
Would you go to Las Vegas
and not go visit

01:54.415 --> 01:55.716
historic Lake Mead?

01:55.749 --> 01:59.353
It's Friday night, Min.
Go out and have fun.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.222
Me? The way I dress?
The way I flirt?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.390
I'm always asking for it.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.624
Wouldn't you rather
have me stay in?

02:03.657 --> 02:06.294
No, I trust you, but it's time
to go out and meet a friend.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.761
Hey.
Oh, sorry.

02:07.795 --> 02:08.962
I got to--got to go.

02:08.996 --> 02:12.666
Wait, no, I have to just--
I want to ask one more thing.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.567
(Danny)
Are you kidding me?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.436
Who would ruin
a perfectly good muffin

02:15.469 --> 02:16.837
by putting chocolate chips
in here?

02:16.870 --> 02:19.407
Whoo! Who's ready
to hang out tonight?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.674
Tonight?

02:20.708 --> 02:22.476
Three years ago I asked you
to hang out, and you were like,

02:22.510 --> 02:25.446
"Oh, I'm too busy.
Ask me again in 2015."

02:25.479 --> 02:27.181
That was three years ago
tonight,

02:27.215 --> 02:28.916
so me and you...
[clicks tongue]

02:28.949 --> 02:31.752
I remember that conversation.
I'm sorry, I can't tonight.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.687
Wait, you told Dr. Reed you
didn't have any plans tonight.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.489
Busted.
I wrote it in the notes.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.591
Your notes?
This wasn't a meeting.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.360
Notes for my memoir.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.229
I owe Random House a draft,
like, last week.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.830
You know what,
I'll just do what I normally do

02:42.863 --> 02:44.498
on Friday nights:
I'll just sit on the stoop

02:44.532 --> 02:46.700
and pretend I'm hanging out
with you.

02:46.734 --> 02:47.901
You want to...take a muffin?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.570
Thanks.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.340
The chips are
the best part.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.708
Look, Morgan,
come over tonight.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.211
Me and you will hang,
just a little bit.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.879
Just you, no dogs.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.415
Just, you know, dogs.
No dogs.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.584
Know dogs? Yeah, I know,
like, a million dogs.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.619
I'll see you at 7:30.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.394
[high-pitched weeping]

03:16.697 --> 03:18.332
Hello?

03:18.366 --> 03:20.734
[weeping continues]
Miss?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.403
Why don't you open the door,
and we can just have,

03:22.436 --> 03:24.972
like, a girl-to-girl chat?

03:25.005 --> 03:28.476
Dr. Gurgler?
Ah, great. It's you.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.679
Rob, what are you doing
in here?

03:31.712 --> 03:32.880
You know,
I just moved in here.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.014
Barb and I,
we're--we're finished.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.450
Yeah, after she cheated,
you know, there's no going back.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.217
Good for you.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.287
I mean,
that's what she told me.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.321
I'm still hopeful.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.856
What? She cheated,
and she gets to keep the house,

03:42.890 --> 03:44.358
and you have to live
in grad student housing?

03:44.392 --> 03:46.894
Okay, well, we both--
we both messed up.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.330
You know, my seasonal allergies,
they drove her to cheat.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.264
She--she was justified.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.300
This is sadder than sad,

03:52.333 --> 03:54.435
but maybe we can help
each other out.

03:54.468 --> 03:59.307
I need to make a friend, and
I see some rope in your closet

03:59.340 --> 04:00.441
that I'm really
not crazy about,

04:00.474 --> 04:01.942
so why don't we forget
about all this,

04:01.975 --> 04:06.347
let's go to San Francisco,
and let's go make a night of it.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.515
What, really?
Yeah.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.318
I mean, you wouldn't
be intimidated

04:10.351 --> 04:11.752
hanging out
with a supervisor?

04:11.785 --> 04:15.356
Lucky for you, I have no sense
of professional boundaries.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.156
Oh.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.825
So let's put some pants on,
bossman.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.992
All right.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.930
I am so excited to hang out
one on one with you--

04:22.963 --> 04:24.432
never happened.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.835
I even made a list
of conversation topics.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.371
London Olympics,
what did you think?

04:30.404 --> 04:33.574
[Lauren chuckles]

04:33.607 --> 04:34.775
That was weird, huh?

04:34.808 --> 04:37.611
Having a summer Olympics in
a rainy locale is very strange.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.979
I wrote letters--
No, no.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.349
Jeremy's girlfriend just went
into Peter's apartment.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.885
This is huge!
This is huge!

04:44.918 --> 04:49.457
Do you think Dr. P and Lauren
are [whispers] frenching?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.692
If it's out of the office,
it's none of our business.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.026
Did I hear Beverly's voice
come out of an Elmo

04:53.060 --> 04:54.362
in the middle of Times Square?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.397
Maybe, but it's
none of our business.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.332
No, you're right.
You're right.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.433
It's not our business.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.835
That's it.
Right.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.071
[sighs]

05:04.104 --> 05:06.440
You know I'm a huge wall nerd,
right?
You are?

05:06.474 --> 05:10.378
Yeah, I love 'em. I can't--
I can't get enough of 'em.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.546
Yeah, I love 'em too.
Yeah.

05:12.580 --> 05:17.418
And this one is really nice
and not too thick.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.520
[muffled laughter]

05:19.553 --> 05:21.789
[mouthing]

05:21.822 --> 05:23.757
(Mindy)
I was hoping

05:23.791 --> 05:27.094
for an authentic San Francisco
trans bar experience.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.363
Guess I don't need
this anymore.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.898
This place is kind of awesome.
Yeah.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.099
Oh, there's a table.
You want to grab it?

05:32.132 --> 05:33.066
Yeah, let's get it.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.503
Isn't it so cool
that Danny trusts me enough

05:35.536 --> 05:36.837
to let me spend a night
out on the town?

05:36.870 --> 05:37.671
[Rob laughs]

05:37.705 --> 05:39.607
You know, Barb and I
used to come here.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.475
This is the table
where we decided

05:41.509 --> 05:42.676
we didn't want
to have kids.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.844
Well, she decided.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.579
Forget about Barb, okay?

05:45.613 --> 05:48.115
We're out in San Francisco,
the Windy City.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.951
You could meet the love
of your life here.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.386
It is Sin City, after all.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.423
[chuckles]
Yeah. You're right.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.890
You know, I-I used to be
quite the player

05:56.924 --> 05:58.426
before Barb tamed me.
Ooh.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.661
I find that very hard
to believe.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.895
I once dated
a 49ers girl.

06:01.929 --> 06:02.730
Oh.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.164
If we're counting
their HR department.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.099
That's the spirit, yeah.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.469
Okay, I'm going
to go get us drinks.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.404
You order every appetizer.
Okay.

06:12.773 --> 06:13.941
Oh. Bartender?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.444
I'd like to order a drink.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.277
Excuse me?

06:17.310 --> 06:19.079
Okay, don't make me
call you racist.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.649
Can I get your oldest
Japanese whiskey? One cube.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.451
(bartender)
You got it.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.519
Oh.
I see how it is.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.087
When the world's
most handsome man

06:27.120 --> 06:30.023
orders a cool-sounding drink,
he is served immediately,

06:30.057 --> 06:31.925
but when the world's most
handsome woman wants a drink--

06:31.959 --> 06:35.663
Excuse me.
Are you Mindy Lahiri?

06:35.696 --> 06:38.098
Yeah. Oh, no.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.700
Are you
from the student loan office?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.068
I knew this day would come.
No.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.570
Mindy.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.439
It's me, Alex.

06:45.473 --> 06:49.843
I-I lost my virginity to you.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.878
Whoa.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.617
Rob, I want you to meet
my old friend, Xander.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.586
Hey.
It's Alex these days.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.154
Oh.
Alex Eakin?

07:01.188 --> 07:02.155
Wait, you know him?

07:02.189 --> 07:04.825
Alex Eakin is a tech legend.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.227
He's WIRED magazine's
Person of the Year.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.696
Well, I was last year.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.598
This year
it's "Girls Who Code."

07:10.631 --> 07:13.066
Yeah.
Wait, how do you know him?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.903
Xander, as I knew him,
he and I shared

07:15.936 --> 07:19.006
kind of a wild weekend
back in college.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.609
Let me weave you a tale.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.977
Oh, appetizers are here.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.680
Mmm, delicious.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.650
All right, now let me
weave you a tale.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.552
The year, 2004.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.754
America was still able
to enjoy the music

07:33.787 --> 07:35.489
of R. Kelly without guilt.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.690
There was something
going on in Iraq

07:36.724 --> 07:38.759
that I don't exactly remember.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.195
But most importantly,
a 24-year-old Mindy Lahiri had,

07:42.229 --> 07:44.532
brace yourself,
yet to lose her virginity--

07:44.565 --> 07:45.533
[Gwen Stefani's Hollaback Girl]

07:45.566 --> 07:47.935
Armed in boot-cut jeans,
my cowl-neck sweater,

07:47.968 --> 07:49.870
and prescription blue
contact lenses,

07:49.903 --> 07:52.272
I headed back to college
to lose my V-card.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.207
Who was my best prospect?

07:54.241 --> 07:57.210
White guys who are
into Asian stuff.

07:57.244 --> 08:01.682
And there I saw him,
Xander Eakin and his ponytail.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.984
[romantic music]

08:04.017 --> 08:05.485
Yeah, you'll do.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.488
[slurping]

08:09.289 --> 08:11.258
Wow, sex is cool.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.060
I mean, there was more ponytail
hair in my mouth

08:13.093 --> 08:14.094
than I thought, but--

08:14.127 --> 08:15.128
Arigato.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.264
[laughs]
Hey, let's keep hanging out.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.899
I want to show you
this website I created

08:18.932 --> 08:20.233
to share Monty Python videos.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.202
I probably wouldn't use it,

08:22.235 --> 08:24.304
because while I love
Monty Python,

08:24.337 --> 08:26.206
I wouldn't want people
to know I watched it.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.809
Would you use it
if nobody knew it was you?

08:28.842 --> 08:32.179
Like it was anonymous?
I guess so.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.814
Huh.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.685
I could make posting
anonymous.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.320
Scrub the user's IP address.
Mm.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.755
Make it so people
have the freedom

08:41.789 --> 08:43.256
to post anything they want.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.257
Computer talk.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.159
Will I see you again?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.595
We could try the position
where I'm on top.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.297
Missionary?
I'd rather die.
Hmm.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.932
This should just be
one magical night.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.267
If you're lonely,
just say my name,

08:54.301 --> 08:56.336
and I'll be there.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.972
In your crank bank.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.641
And he was always there
in mine.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.710
Wait.
You were a virgin too?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.311
But you gave me
so many notes.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.680
Yeah. Well, you know,
medically, actually,

09:06.714 --> 09:08.248
I lost my virginity
in a trampoline accident,

09:08.281 --> 09:10.283
but that's an even longer story
for another day.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.653
You know, Mindy,
I have to thank you.

09:12.686 --> 09:16.056
You gave me the idea
to let users post anonymously,

09:16.089 --> 09:18.025
and that's what put
VideoDumpster on the map.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.259
Wait, you created
VideoDumpster?

09:19.292 --> 09:22.162
That's my favorite place to get
all my A-list wiener pics.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.865
Alex, I'm so glad
I ran into you.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.133
Really?

09:26.166 --> 09:29.970
Then why didn't you respond
to any of my emails?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.972
Emails?
Yeah, emails.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.040
Like the one I just sent you

09:33.073 --> 09:36.109
asking to please include me
in the conversation.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.049
[whispering] Can't believe
we're snooping on Peter.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.383
I'm not nosy.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.085
I don't even go to restaurants
with open kitchens.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.086
None of my business.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.755
[whispering] Okay,
you know what, you're right.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.322
But if one of our friends
is cheating,

09:49.356 --> 09:50.691
it's our duty
to figure it out.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.859
We don't know
if they're cheating.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.895
Maybe Peter and Lauren
are just friends.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.730
(Peter)
Okay, baby,
no more messing around.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.332
It's time to put it
in your mouth.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.300
That's disgusting.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.235
Come on, just try it.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.071
You liked it last time.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.373
Open wide.
That's it.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.142
First you didn't want it,
now you can't get enough of it.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.678
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, boy.

10:10.711 --> 10:15.115
Oh, here it is.
From 2012.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.149
You sent it
to my old college account.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.418
Why didn't you answer it?
Well, I never got it.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.921
All my alumni emails
go to spam

10:20.954 --> 10:23.323
because they're always
asking me for money

10:23.356 --> 10:25.025
because one time I fell through
a stained glass window.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.327
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.262
(Alex)
"Mindy, I know
it might seem silly,

10:29.296 --> 10:31.765
but I've never been able
to forget the night we shared."

10:31.799 --> 10:33.133
Good-bye, Xander.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.302
(Alex)
"It motivated me to buckle down
and become the kind of guy

10:35.335 --> 10:37.838
Mindy Lahiri would be proud
to call her boyfriend."

10:37.871 --> 10:39.773
Good-bye, Xander.

10:39.807 --> 10:43.343
"Nowadays, women throw
themselves at me for my money.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.913
"The sex is amazing,
but it's also exhausting.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.314
"I want something real.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.282
"I'm coming to New York
next week.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.351
"I know it's a long shot,
but I'd be honored

10:51.384 --> 10:53.320
"if you'd be my date

10:53.353 --> 10:55.322
"to People's 'Most Beautiful
Billionaires' gala.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.191
"It's me, Rupert Murdoch,
and the hottest bin Laden.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.728
I'll be waiting out in front
of my hotel until 7:45."

11:00.761 --> 11:01.695
All right, let's go.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.864
"I would be proud to have you
as my date.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.699
Love, Xander."

11:05.733 --> 11:06.900
I ended up having a three-way

11:06.934 --> 11:08.268
with a couple underwear models
that night.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.138
But I imagined they were you,
for some of it.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.807
Okay.
[phone rings]

11:13.841 --> 11:15.275
Ooh, I got to take this.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.345
Madame Tussaud screwed up,
and my statue is only 6'3".

11:18.378 --> 11:21.014
[laughs]

11:21.048 --> 11:22.215
Don't go anywhere.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.886
Wow.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.321
Without me, there'd basically
be no Internet right now.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.324
Yeah. Hey, you know what else
is interesting?
Mm-hmm?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.359
Since Alex has been here,

11:32.392 --> 11:34.094
you haven't mentioned
the love of your life once.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.028
What are you talking about?

11:35.062 --> 11:37.130
I've talked about spareribs,
like, ten times.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.799
Oh, Danny!
Yeah, Danny.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.333
Well, how is that supposed
to come up organically?

11:40.367 --> 11:41.201
"Oh, I love spareribs.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.136
Oh, I have a boyfriend
named Danny."

11:43.170 --> 11:44.838
Maybe I'm just jaded
about Barb.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.039
Mm-hmm.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.842
Hey, uh, you think I could look
at that email Alex sent you?

11:48.876 --> 11:51.078
I just want to remember
what romance sounds like.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.981
Sure.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.351
[phone swishes]

11:58.385 --> 11:59.219
What did you just do?

11:59.252 --> 12:01.288
Oh, I just forwarded
the email to Danny.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.222
But that's cool, right?

12:02.255 --> 12:04.224
'Cause you and Alex are
"just old friends"?

12:04.257 --> 12:06.760
Why would you do that?

12:06.794 --> 12:08.161
You got Gurgled.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.805
[phone buzzes]

12:17.838 --> 12:19.139
What's up, Rice-A-Broni?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.273
(Mindy)
Oh, Peter, thank God.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.508
I need you to go
into Danny's computer,

12:21.541 --> 12:22.976
and I need you to delete
an email.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.412
His password is
either ThatStatenKid

12:25.445 --> 12:26.613
or Vatican1Forever.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.082
Did you take a bathroom selfie
and forget to flush again?

12:29.116 --> 12:30.417
That was one time.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.919
Okay, don't read the email.
It means nothing.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.553
It would just bother Danny
for no reason.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.788
Please, Peter.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.956
[clicks tongue]

12:35.989 --> 12:37.490
I just got the baby down.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.293
Henry will understand.
Please, I'm begging you.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.294
Fine.
Thank you.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.262
I love you.
I love you.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.432
Okay, Morgan,
we don't know all the facts.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.567
Let's not jump to conclusions.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.803
Dr. Reed, it's Morgan.
I'm at Dr. C's house.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.571
There's a cheating scandal
that is going to blow your mind.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.040
You are involved.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.374
[screams]
Are you crazy?

12:54.407 --> 12:55.843
I need my hands
for crafts!

12:55.876 --> 12:56.877
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to gra--

12:56.910 --> 12:59.246
[knocks at door]

12:59.279 --> 13:02.049
Yeah?
Hey, it's Peter.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.418
Peter who?
I'm sorry, what?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.420
You hide.
I'll answer the door.
Okay.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.056
Wait, he knows I'm here.
Why should I hide?

13:09.089 --> 13:10.157
We'll both hide.
No.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.026
We'll both answer.
Relax. Coming.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.194
Hi, Pete.
Hey.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.362
Hi.
Can I use your computer?

13:15.395 --> 13:16.363
My Wi-Fi is out.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.231
That's fine.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.333
Yeah, it's fine.
Come on in, it's in the--

13:20.367 --> 13:21.568
It's right in the--
It's in the bedroom.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.837
Cool.
It's--Yeah.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.572
What's--what's--

13:25.605 --> 13:29.076
Is that Lauren's baby?
Shh. Yeah.

13:29.109 --> 13:32.445
Lauren had to work late.
I babysit sometimes.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.014
[whispers] He was talking
to the kid the whole time.

13:34.047 --> 13:34.882
[phone chimes]

13:34.915 --> 13:36.183
You were right on this one.
Thank you.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.517
You know what?
I always say that--

13:37.550 --> 13:39.386
What?
Huh.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.421
What?

13:41.454 --> 13:43.223
This is actually funny.
What?

13:43.256 --> 13:45.258
Dr. Reed--
Yeah?

13:45.292 --> 13:48.295
He got my message,
and he's going to come here.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.496
When you just called him
right now.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.563
Yeah.
He's coming here.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.300
Yeah.
Is he going to freak out?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.101
Why did you--
[screams]

13:54.134 --> 13:55.268
Why did you leave him
a message?

13:55.302 --> 13:58.005
Shh! Quiet down!
I told you about my hands!

13:58.038 --> 13:59.506
(Danny)
Sorry. Just relax.
We're fine.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.541
(Morgan)
Okay, sorry, sorry.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.243
What the hell is he doing
in there?

14:03.276 --> 14:06.279
[footsteps approaching]

14:11.384 --> 14:13.486
I ran all the way
from the opera.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.388
Who's cheating?
Who's cheating?

14:15.422 --> 14:17.624
Oh, that.
Uh--

14:17.657 --> 14:20.460
That--that was just something
stupid that we--we thought.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.230
We thought maybe Lauren--

14:23.263 --> 14:24.564
I knew it, I knew it.
No, no--

14:24.597 --> 14:26.433
Of course Lauren cheats on me.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.468
It's not my fault
her baby hates me.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.904
I can't make him eat,
I can't make him sleep,

14:30.938 --> 14:32.505
and I can't make him
not poop on me.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.806
You know, we have nothing
in common.

14:33.840 --> 14:38.311
Whenever we hang out, I'm like,
"Is he being weird, or am I?"

14:38.345 --> 14:40.280
I mean, of course
she would cheat on me.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.950
I'm just a pedantic foreigner
with a silly "ecksunt."

14:42.983 --> 14:45.685
(both)
No! What?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.620
That's crazy.
Are you crazy?

14:47.654 --> 14:50.323
No one would cheat on you.
Look at you.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.593
The opera lover
with the...velvet cool cape?

14:53.626 --> 14:54.694
Hold on.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.297
If Lauren's not cheating,
then who's the cheater?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.632
I--
I think personally--

14:59.666 --> 15:01.534
That Morgan is.
Morgan?

15:01.568 --> 15:02.769
(Danny)
Yep.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.471
That doesn't sound a lot
like Morgan, does it?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.606
With whom?

15:06.639 --> 15:07.674
Dr. L.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.542
Mindy?
You see? He's cheating with--

15:09.576 --> 15:10.543
Wait, what?
[key bangs on piano]

15:10.577 --> 15:12.012
[whispers]
Sorry.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.013
It's true.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.447
Danny, I'm sorry.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.649
Mindy had me come over here
and delete a skanky email.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.318
I didn't read it.
I don't know why.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.054
But I can only assume
that this is what it was about.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.491
This is better
than the opera.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.528
[phone buzzes]

15:33.100 --> 15:37.270
Sorry that took so long.
What's wrong?

15:37.304 --> 15:39.239
Bitcoin for your thoughts?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.108
Penny.
Sorry, sometimes I forget.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.642
[both chuckle]

15:42.675 --> 15:44.411
You know, I wish
I had gotten that email.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.580
We would've crushed that gala.
They would've loved me.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.516
I have a billionaire's
sense of entitlement.

15:49.549 --> 15:53.553
Maybe we could've seen
each other afterwards.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.423
[chuckles]

15:56.456 --> 15:57.624
Hey, this is really fun.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.526
Let's get out of here.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.694
Do you want to go for a walk?
We can keep talking.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.597
(bartender)
Dude, I thought
I told you to leave!

16:04.631 --> 16:05.999
You can't tell me to leave!

16:06.033 --> 16:08.001
You're not my wife!

16:08.035 --> 16:10.070
Huh? Yeah!
Oh, you like that?

16:10.103 --> 16:11.671
Oh, my God.
Is that your friend?

16:14.407 --> 16:15.442
Oh, God. Oh, God.
This is all my fault.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.576
I should've just let him
kill himself in his room.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.479
[speaking Japanese]

16:19.512 --> 16:21.114
(Rob)
Let me get him!
Let me get him!

16:21.148 --> 16:22.482
Come on!
No, no, no, no, no!

16:22.515 --> 16:24.084
Oh, ooh, look at me, big man.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.553
Who's on top now, buddy?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.021
Oh, God!

16:28.055 --> 16:29.022
Yah!

16:29.056 --> 16:31.358
[crowd screams]

16:31.391 --> 16:33.560
Yah!
[screams]

16:36.296 --> 16:37.297
Everyone safe?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.166
[crowd murmurs]

16:39.199 --> 16:41.468
This man may be pitiful.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.404
He may be weak
and angry.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.740
He's wearing
an extra-large tan polo.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.276
And everyone heard that fart.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.543
(woman)
Oh, yeah.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.446
But you know who else
used to be a loser?

16:53.480 --> 16:54.514
Me.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.515
[crowd gasps]

16:55.548 --> 16:56.683
One day, many years ago,

16:56.716 --> 17:01.788
a cool, slightly older woman
rocked my world sexually,

17:01.821 --> 17:04.557
so I can rock
the world technologically.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.561
So let's forgive him.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.499
Because who knows
what he may turn out to be?

17:12.532 --> 17:15.602
Probably nothing, he's, like,
in his 30s, but...

17:15.635 --> 17:18.205
he's okay.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.108
Anyway,
I'm buying everyone's drinks.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.342
[all cheering]

17:22.375 --> 17:23.510
Hell, I'll buy the bar.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.811
[all cheering]

17:24.844 --> 17:26.213
Can I get four mojitos?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.115
Yeah, you're drunk.
He'll have two.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.416
Okay, can I have
two mojitos?

17:29.449 --> 17:32.119
(Morgan)
Yeah, I feel terrible
about this,

17:32.152 --> 17:34.587
but Dr. L kept saying it was
the best sex she's ever had.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.588
It wasn't even that good
for me.

17:35.622 --> 17:39.492
[sighs]
Betrayed by a friend.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.493
Oh, well.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.630
"Oh, well"?
That's it?

17:43.663 --> 17:46.199
No, that's not it.
Pete, you're right.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.768
He cheated
with my girlfriend.

17:48.801 --> 17:52.472
Okay, okay, okay.
Time-out, time-out, everybody.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.406
He called me a friend.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.142
The man deserves a thrashing
and then some.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.110
But let's be adults.
Yeah, you're right.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.512
Okay, look at Peter and I.
We went through this.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.315
We forgave and forgot,
and now

18:02.349 --> 18:04.117
he babysits
my girlfriend's baby.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.218
Yeah, I know.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.553
He puts so much
into a relationship

18:06.586 --> 18:07.787
he gets
almost nothing out of.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.522
(Danny)
Okay, thank you.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.823
No, we're good here,
I think.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.192
Puccini awaits.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.493
Scusi.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.697
You know, I think he's being
a little hyperbolic.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.865
I get a ton
out of this relationship.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.066
Yeah, I know.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.868
I do got to run, because I got
to get this guy in the crib.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.170
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, go, go, go.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.438
(Peter)
Once again,
sorry about the spit-up.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.573
Don't even--
Yeah, wow.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.574
What a great night, huh?

18:27.607 --> 18:28.641
Bye, Dr. P.
Bye-bye.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.710
Why would you tell him
you were cheating with Mindy?

18:30.743 --> 18:31.744
Sorry, it just popped out.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.880
You also said I was a cheater,
for the record.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.582
And a lot of people think

18:35.615 --> 18:38.318
Dr. L and I do have
a very palpable chemistry.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.486
No, they don't.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.388
Well, I'll tell you this much.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.223
Best birthday I ever had.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.695
So do you want
to take that walk?

18:48.728 --> 18:49.929
Oh, man.

18:49.962 --> 18:54.601
Listen, Xander, if I had gotten
your email when you sent it,

18:54.634 --> 18:56.336
man, my panties
would have exploded.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.905
But now

18:58.938 --> 19:01.841
it just makes me
miss my boyfriend.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.576
Boyfriend? Oh.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.179
Okay.
Boy, he must be someone great.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.581
Is it Richard Branson?
Dalai Lama?

19:08.615 --> 19:11.284
Okay, it's obviously not
either of those guys.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.621
He's just a local ethnic man
named Danny Castellano.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.656
He might not have your money
or your height

19:16.689 --> 19:19.192
or your tolerance
for other cultures, actually,

19:19.226 --> 19:21.328
but he makes me happy,

19:21.361 --> 19:24.664
even when he's, like, 100 miles
away, in New York City,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.333
the City of Brotherly Lights.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.600
[inhales]

19:29.469 --> 19:31.271
What the hell?
Ow!

19:31.304 --> 19:33.306
That's my boyfriend.
My boobs!

19:33.340 --> 19:36.743
God! Why don't you
pick on boobs your own size?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.878
Are you really cheating on me
with this nerd, Alex?

19:38.911 --> 19:41.448
Is this because I fell asleep
during your TED Talk?

19:41.481 --> 19:42.982
It was so boring.
It was ten minutes.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.917
They can be very tedious.
Mindy...

19:44.951 --> 19:47.620
uh, meet my girlfriend,
Grace.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.522
Did I not say "girlfriend"
earlier?

19:49.556 --> 19:52.825
No, you didn't.
But I didn't either.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.595
But I did before you did.
And I did him before you did.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.597
So, like, 12 years ago.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.267
I was, like, ten then, thanks.
Okay, well, I'm ten now.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.301
Like, 10 jillion.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.101
I'm not 10 jillion!
Hey, whoa!

20:02.134 --> 20:04.604
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:04.637 --> 20:06.473
That is my only friend.
Okay?

20:06.506 --> 20:07.707
Obviously.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.509
[screams]

20:09.542 --> 20:11.511
All right, okay.
You should go.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.680
She won the secret Hunger Games
we billionaires have.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.482
Oh, my God.
Okay, okay.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.350
We shouldn't have
done that.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.951
You'll always be
in my bank.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.490
(Lauren)
Peter, thank you so much
for babysitting.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.592
I'm going to need you again
next Thursday.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.495
Jeremy has a flute recital,
and I can't miss another one.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.930
Yeah. Okay, no problem.
Okay. Thank you.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.899
You know what?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.301
It's a big problem.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.538
I don't want to be
your babysitter anymore.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.839
What are you saying?

20:49.081 --> 20:52.585
I did wish
for a birthday kiss.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.953
Should've been specific.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.688
[phone chimes]

20:55.722 --> 20:57.857
Hey, babe,
you're calling late.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.526
Just wanted to say,
"Hey, sugar, what's shaking?"

20:59.559 --> 21:01.594
Hey, that's my line.
Oh, no.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.464
Does this mean it's caught on
with old people? Damn it.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.533
I was wondering,
did you talk to Peter

21:06.566 --> 21:08.267
and tell him to delete
an email to me?

21:10.370 --> 21:11.471
I did. I did.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.940
But it was just a stupid email
from an ex-boyfriend.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.943
I didn't want you to read it
and get worried over nothing.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.712
No, come on. I'm not worried.
I trust you.

21:21.047 --> 21:21.814
I trust you.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.584
Ah, but only
about our relationship.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.354
I do not trust you not to eat
junk food for every meal.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.888
[crunch]
What are you eating now?

21:28.921 --> 21:29.956
Sounds like chips.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.758
Yeah, they're krale chips.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.760
(Danny)
Krale isn't a vegetable.
