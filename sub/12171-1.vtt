WEBVTT

00:13.000 --> 00:15.083
- Previously
on			 Shahs of Sunset...

00:16.542 --> 00:18.125
- I am deep in the midst

00:18.167 --> 00:19.542
of a gay life crisis.

00:19.542 --> 00:20.708
Will you marry me?

00:20.708 --> 00:22.208
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.500
- I'm getting married.

00:23.542 --> 00:25.208
- You are not
the marriage material.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.792
- Mercedes, do you want a kid?
- Yeah.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.667
- When we left Iran
when I was eight years old,

00:29.708 --> 00:31.500
my parents sacrificed everything

00:31.542 --> 00:32.500
for my brother and I

00:32.542 --> 00:33.875
to have a great life.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.167
- I was diagnosed
with rheumatoid arthritis.

00:36.208 --> 00:38.792
If I wanna have kids,
I can't even hold them.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.042
You kept trying to f--- me
in Turkey, bitch.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.542
- Get me the f--- out of here.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.500
- How do you rebuild the trust?

00:44.542 --> 00:46.542
- The bridge has been broken
but not burned.

00:46.542 --> 00:48.542
- I canceled the wedding.

00:48.583 --> 00:50.083
- And now, this season

00:50.083 --> 00:51.625
on			 Shahs of Sunset...

00:52.583 --> 00:53.708
- Here we are, bitches.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.583
Can I get a hallelujah?

00:55.583 --> 00:56.875
Hallelujah.

00:56.917 --> 00:57.958
- What is that?

00:59.458 --> 01:01.625
- don't bite the banana.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.375
- We landed safely.

01:04.417 --> 01:06.000
35-year-old persian man

01:06.042 --> 01:07.208
is supposed to be married.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.875
You're just awesome.
- Perfect girl?

01:08.917 --> 01:10.208
- Until you talked.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.083
I'm definitely not there.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.333
- don't collapse.
- I would love for Asa

01:14.375 --> 01:16.750
to officiate at my wedding.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.375
- No.
- I have a company I started

01:18.417 --> 01:19.583
that I'm excited about.

01:19.625 --> 01:21.042
I've had to hire more people.

01:21.083 --> 01:23.042
My dad, my brother
were my first choices.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.750
Mom, get out
of the picture, please.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.375
- Ugh.
- You're so f---ing pretty.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.250
- I have a new relationship.

01:28.292 --> 01:30.750
- He's not a good match for you.
- If I had the money,

01:30.792 --> 01:32.292
there would already be a ring
on her finger.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.958
- We've had some amazing times.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.083
Let's party.

01:38.292 --> 01:39.417
- And the worst of times.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.458
- Mother of god.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.750
Did you put your hands on me?

01:42.792 --> 01:44.792
- There's something
going on with gg.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.292
- Ooh, ow.
- I'm worried.

01:46.292 --> 01:47.958
- You cheated on me?
Let's talk about it.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.417
- Jessica.
- Do not touch me.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.792
- So you don't wanna
get married?

01:51.792 --> 01:53.625
- I don't know.
- What are you talking about?

01:53.625 --> 01:54.958
- I want her back.
- I don't think

01:55.000 --> 01:57.417
I'm gonna go back to him.
- This is ridiculous.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.125
- Just being a provider
is not enough.

01:59.125 --> 02:00.208
I've screwed up.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.625
- I speak my mind.

02:01.667 --> 02:02.750
- What?
Did I stutter bitch?

02:02.792 --> 02:04.042
- I'll chime in what the f---

02:04.083 --> 02:05.125
I wanna chime in.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.417
- Stop.

02:06.458 --> 02:07.542
- You're my best friend.

02:07.583 --> 02:08.958
- Ahh.

02:08.958 --> 02:10.708
It's gonna be
a good f---ing summer.

02:10.750 --> 02:11.833
- Love you all.

02:11.833 --> 02:13.750

02:54.542 --> 02:56.958
- Last year, I f---ed up.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.167
I stood Adam up at the altar.

02:59.208 --> 03:00.875
Thank you guys for coming,

03:00.917 --> 03:03.375
clearly this was

03:03.375 --> 03:06.042
the wedding spot.

03:06.042 --> 03:07.542
I was a disgusting whore

03:07.542 --> 03:09.208
at my bachelor party.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.875
- I've got
some assorted condoms.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.000
- What?

03:13.042 --> 03:15.042
I did everything I could

03:15.042 --> 03:16.333
to f--- it up.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.833
Any rational, reasonable person

03:18.875 --> 03:20.208
would have left.

03:25.667 --> 03:26.708
But I was lucky,

03:26.708 --> 03:28.542
Adam stuck around.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.125
- Zanam,

03:30.167 --> 03:32.083
zanam.
- Honey.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.667
It looks like everything
is peachy-keen.

03:37.708 --> 03:38.917
That wasn't how it was

03:38.917 --> 03:41.083
when I came back from Thailand.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.750
It was like, painful.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.417
- Do you want breakfast?

03:45.417 --> 03:47.208
- Are you making it?

03:47.250 --> 03:48.417
- I always make you breakfast.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.083
- Oh shut up.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.417
We started talking,

03:51.417 --> 03:53.750
I started going to more therapy.

03:53.792 --> 03:55.833
Tini's still sleeping.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.583
We committed to making

04:01.625 --> 04:03.375
our relationship work

04:03.417 --> 04:05.250
and it was hard.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.000
Thanks for my omelet.

04:07.042 --> 04:08.083
Come sit.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.417
Why are you using two forks?

04:15.208 --> 04:17.292
- Because I'm scooping it
onto my other fork.

04:17.292 --> 04:18.625
- I seriously want you

04:18.625 --> 04:19.958
to take me to the trailer park

04:19.958 --> 04:21.208
that you grew up in one day.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.292
- Honey, I never
even stepped foot

04:23.333 --> 04:24.958
on a property of trailer.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.125
- I'm just saying, later on

04:26.125 --> 04:27.458
when we're at a restaurant.

04:27.458 --> 04:29.208
- Well, seeing how this isn't

04:29.250 --> 04:31.042
a five-star restaurant,

04:31.083 --> 04:32.292
it doesn't matter.

04:32.292 --> 04:33.375
- There you go.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.125
- Aren't you happy
I stuck around?

04:35.125 --> 04:36.625
- Well, you've been
a lot better

04:36.625 --> 04:39.917
in your seductive skills.

04:39.958 --> 04:41.750
- You know what,
in that department,

04:41.792 --> 04:43.042
it's a two-way street.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.958
Yeah, yeah.
- That's why we've had

04:44.958 --> 04:46.458
talks about, "hey,

04:46.458 --> 04:47.917
can you,

04:47.958 --> 04:49.250
you know,

04:49.292 --> 04:50.583
move around?"

04:51.750 --> 04:53.208
- I'm always the one
moving around.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.292
I'm always the one who'd try

04:54.333 --> 04:56.292
to initiate things.

04:56.292 --> 04:57.542
- Honey.
- What?

04:57.583 --> 04:59.250
- Laying in bed after a shower

04:59.292 --> 05:02.083
is not initiating anything.
- Honey, but...

05:02.125 --> 05:03.500
I just happen to be laying
in bed every time.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.167
- With your legs spread eagle.

05:05.167 --> 05:06.458
- That is not true.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.583
- Any time

05:07.625 --> 05:09.333
I come into the bedroom,

05:09.375 --> 05:10.625
this is you.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.667
- Honey, that is not true,

05:12.667 --> 05:13.792
I don't do that.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.667
- Now that I've patched
things up with Adam,

05:15.708 --> 05:18.083
my to-do list
is short and sweet.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.958
Get married, build a house,

05:20.000 --> 05:21.792
have fun with friends and family

05:21.833 --> 05:23.667
and have sex and buy gold.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.458
That is what I'm focused on.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.958
Tini.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.917
- Oh my god.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.583
I have this.

05:36.625 --> 05:38.208
I was looking for that.

05:39.833 --> 05:41.583
Oh my god, so much.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.333
Come on, little girl.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.667
- There's my girl.

05:46.708 --> 05:49.000
You know, I'm just with you
to get to her.

05:49.042 --> 05:50.458
- Mm-hmm.
- She's the cutest,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.000
oh she's the cutest.

05:53.167 --> 05:55.500
- Lightning strikes

05:55.542 --> 05:56.958
in mj's life.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.375
I love you.
- I love you.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.542
- I was talking to her.
- Oh.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.667
- And I now have a new man

06:02.708 --> 06:05.542
that I like a lot,

06:05.542 --> 06:07.042
really like.

06:07.042 --> 06:09.208
Okay, I need to purge.

06:09.208 --> 06:10.542
I need to get rid of things.

06:10.542 --> 06:13.125
I need to create new things

06:13.167 --> 06:15.625
to come into my life, like you.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.375
Out with the old,
in with the new.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.208
- Gotcha.
- And then Oprah has a rule,

06:19.250 --> 06:20.875
like if you haven't worn it
in a year,

06:20.917 --> 06:22.417
you should probably
get rid of it.

06:22.417 --> 06:24.250
- And if Oprah says it,
then that's like,

06:24.292 --> 06:26.083
they should put it
into the constitution.

06:26.125 --> 06:27.250
- Tommy and I

06:27.292 --> 06:29.083
met the new age,

06:29.083 --> 06:30.375
old fashioned way,

06:30.417 --> 06:31.708
on social media.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.167
Started with the right swipe,

06:33.208 --> 06:34.250
text, text, text.

06:34.292 --> 06:36.083
"I want to see you in person."

06:36.083 --> 06:38.000
I get out of my uber

06:38.042 --> 06:40.750
and he's wearing
these basketball shorts

06:40.750 --> 06:43.583
and here's his erection.

06:43.583 --> 06:45.250
And I guess the fact

06:45.250 --> 06:47.542
that I didn't run back
into the car

06:47.583 --> 06:51.083
meant that
we were somehow destined

06:51.083 --> 06:52.708
to be together.

06:54.792 --> 06:55.917
- What's going on over here?

06:55.958 --> 06:57.917
- These are 20 years
worth of shoes.

06:57.958 --> 06:59.500
I would like a lot
of these shoes

06:59.542 --> 07:00.917
that have never been worn

07:00.917 --> 07:01.917
to be bequeathed
to somebody else.

07:01.958 --> 07:03.792
- Bequeath, like a queef.

07:03.792 --> 07:05.583
- No, to be bequeathed.
- Whoa, queef.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.125
- Not a queef.
- Oh, a queef, not a queef.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.292
- Stop it.

07:08.292 --> 07:10.292
Tommy and I both have
our own flats, right?

07:10.333 --> 07:13.250
But there's a part of me
that knows

07:13.292 --> 07:16.625
that if I don't experience
cohabitation with him,

07:16.625 --> 07:18.458
that I won't be able to take it

07:18.500 --> 07:19.625
to the next level.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.250
So, I'm going to create space

07:21.292 --> 07:22.583
in my heart and in my mind

07:22.625 --> 07:23.875
to imagine

07:23.917 --> 07:26.292
some really cool sh--

07:26.292 --> 07:28.792
like my future.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.542
So, I think these need to go.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.917
- Send 'em out, let's go.
- don't you wanna see

07:31.958 --> 07:32.958
what they look like?
- Not at all.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.792
- These are a museum piece,

07:34.792 --> 07:35.875
these are my first pair

07:35.917 --> 07:37.625
of Vivienne Westwood's.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.417
- Do you wanna call
the Smithsonian?

07:55.958 --> 07:57.333
- You look sexy.
- You know, I try.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.000
Happy four months, by the way.

08:02.042 --> 08:04.292
- Yeah.
- I genuinely

08:04.333 --> 08:05.583
with all of my heart

08:05.625 --> 08:06.833
love Jessica

08:06.833 --> 08:08.667
and I want her to be with me

08:08.667 --> 08:10.667
until the day that I'm dead.

08:10.667 --> 08:11.958
Marriage, when it's amazing,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.833
it is so amazing,

08:13.875 --> 08:16.250
like, you can't be happier.

08:16.292 --> 08:18.167
- That wedding ring looks
really good on you.

08:18.167 --> 08:20.458
- Yet when it's hard,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.833
it's so f---ing hard.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.417
- Okay, stretch, please.

08:24.458 --> 08:25.583
- Wanna go out with the boys,

08:25.625 --> 08:27.042
I have to ask permission.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.625
I want to work late,

08:28.667 --> 08:29.708
I have to ask permission.

08:29.750 --> 08:30.958
I want to go to the gym
after work

08:31.000 --> 08:32.542
and not come home
for dinner right away,

08:32.542 --> 08:34.208
I have to ask permission.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.833
Dude, I've been cracking
like crazy,

08:35.875 --> 08:37.125
like my whole body.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.208
- What do you mean?
- Just like everything cracks.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.042
- You're getting old, babe.
- F---.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.292
There's no me, it's us.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.208
You run in front of me
as motivation.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.208
- don't stare at my ass
too hard.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.042
These are steep.

08:49.042 --> 08:50.708
It's usually the wife
that gains weight

08:50.708 --> 08:52.875
after the marriage.
- Hey.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.458
Holy sh--.

08:56.042 --> 08:58.375
So the first person up
the hill wins,

08:58.375 --> 09:00.208
loser massages the winner,

09:00.208 --> 09:01.875
one hour oil massage,

09:01.875 --> 09:04.042
head to toe.
- What happens after?

09:04.042 --> 09:05.875
- Yeah, whatever's clever.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.625
One, two, three,

09:08.667 --> 09:09.750
come on,

09:09.750 --> 09:11.083
come on.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.208
Come on,

09:12.250 --> 09:13.583
come on, come on.

09:13.625 --> 09:14.708
Come on,

09:14.750 --> 09:16.250
come on.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.542
- That wasn't fair.

09:20.375 --> 09:21.708
We gotta do more.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.750
- I'm done.

09:23.750 --> 09:24.833
Imagine if this was like,

09:24.875 --> 09:27.000
your house.
- Inshallah

09:27.042 --> 09:28.417
we have a view like this.
- It would be--it would be like,

09:28.417 --> 09:31.167
$40-50 million, at least.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.917
But shervin's birthday's
coming up,

09:32.917 --> 09:35.583
he rented this huge yacht,

09:35.583 --> 09:37.542
so I rsvped for us to go.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.667
I wanna make sure
that you're okay

09:39.708 --> 09:40.750
to be around these guys.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.500
I mean,

09:42.542 --> 09:44.542
everyone's gonna be there, so...

09:44.583 --> 09:47.167
Last year was rough
for me and Jessica.

09:47.208 --> 09:49.083
- I don't give a f---
about any of you guys.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.208
- There it is.
- But Mike gives a f---

09:50.250 --> 09:51.292
about you guys.
- I do.

09:51.292 --> 09:52.458
- I was angry.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.375
Really, really mad,
really, really upset.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.125
- My feeling,
from what I've heard

09:56.125 --> 09:58.583
from the group
is that they're ready

09:58.625 --> 10:00.417
to do whatever it takes

10:00.458 --> 10:02.250
to make the group whole again.

10:02.292 --> 10:04.458
It's crazy,
so for the last year,

10:04.500 --> 10:07.292
I've had really
very minimal interaction

10:07.292 --> 10:08.458
with anyone in the group.

10:08.458 --> 10:09.583
I really love these guys

10:09.625 --> 10:10.583
and I wanted to hang out
with them

10:10.625 --> 10:12.458
but it's interesting
with Jessica.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.792
She doesn't like
this group of friends.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.125
It's like
I'm her prized possession

10:16.167 --> 10:18.250
and she wants to keep
me locked up in a safe.

10:18.292 --> 10:19.583
I want these people part
of my life,

10:19.625 --> 10:22.208
I want them to be
uncle and aunts

10:23.292 --> 10:25.083
to our future children.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.292
- I just hope that gg's
in a place

10:27.333 --> 10:29.917
of, not her craziness,
how she usually is

10:29.958 --> 10:32.917
and can talk on a mature level.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.500
If that can happen,

10:34.500 --> 10:36.667
I'm 100% on board

10:36.667 --> 10:38.125
for moving past this.

10:38.167 --> 10:39.333
- I'm proud of you,
that's big of you.

10:39.375 --> 10:40.792
And I love you.
- I'm a big girl now.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.625
- Coming up...
Let's say Jessica

10:43.667 --> 10:45.500
comes up to you and she goes,

10:45.500 --> 10:47.458
"yeah, you f---ing bitch,
you're a liar."

10:47.500 --> 10:49.250
- Get the f--- outta here.

10:49.292 --> 10:50.333
- I promise to be everything

10:50.333 --> 10:51.500
you could want in a husband.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.625
My wedding night

10:52.667 --> 10:55.125
was the best night of my life,

10:55.167 --> 10:57.417
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.125
- Monkey.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.333
- Monkey,

11:18.375 --> 11:19.375
what are you doing?

11:19.375 --> 11:20.708
- I can't knock.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.375
- How's your hand?
I miss you.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.500
- Me too.
- It's been too long.

11:24.542 --> 11:25.667
- Yeah, how are you?
- Is this for us?

11:25.708 --> 11:27.375
- Yes.
- Thank you.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.375
- How are you?
- Golnesa, this is Emilia.

11:29.417 --> 11:30.708
Emilia, Golnesa.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.375
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my monkey,

11:32.375 --> 11:33.458
you can call her "monk"

11:33.500 --> 11:34.708
but she's not your monkey.

11:34.708 --> 11:35.833
- Okay, okay. Just yours.
- don't get it twisted,

11:35.875 --> 11:36.875
she's my monkey.
- We're each other's

11:36.875 --> 11:38.292
funky monkeys.
- Yeah, exactly.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.375
Come in, come in.

11:39.375 --> 11:40.833
Should we grab...
- How are you?

11:40.875 --> 11:42.125
- I'm good, I'm like,

11:42.167 --> 11:43.833
going a little crazy.
- What are you guys working on?

11:43.875 --> 11:45.875
- We're just putting
out a mailing blast,

11:45.875 --> 11:47.667
we have to prepare for a
photoshoot.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.042
I've always been known
to wear kaftans

11:49.042 --> 11:50.875
and turbans
and accessorize like that.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.667
And everywhere I go,
people are like,

11:52.708 --> 11:54.375
"oh my god,
where did you get this kaftan?"

11:54.375 --> 11:55.542
I'm like, "I made it."

11:55.583 --> 11:57.417
- I see all of your things
on instagram.

11:57.458 --> 11:58.583
- Yeah, I go crazy with it.
- And like, it's just,

11:58.625 --> 11:59.750
it makes me always wanna go
to the beach.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.000
- Look through them,
take whatever you want.

12:01.042 --> 12:02.750
Take as many...
- I need a beer first.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.250
- A few months ago,
I put four designs together,

12:05.292 --> 12:06.583
just four kaftans.

12:06.583 --> 12:07.667
Put it on my instagram

12:07.708 --> 12:09.208
and literally, within months,

12:09.250 --> 12:11.833
it's turned
into this whole startup company.

12:11.875 --> 12:14.083
That's cute, go look.
- Where's the mirror?

12:14.083 --> 12:15.167
- I just wanna bring back

12:15.208 --> 12:17.083
that classic exotic glamor,

12:17.083 --> 12:18.208
like in the 40s,

12:18.250 --> 12:20.833
in the true glamorous times.

12:20.875 --> 12:22.375
I like your moves.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.417
Is that your kaftan move?

12:23.458 --> 12:24.542
- Yeah.
- You're like...

12:24.583 --> 12:25.583
No, it's not that,

12:25.583 --> 12:27.208
it's more like this, like...

12:29.917 --> 12:32.583
- I can't do that,
I'm more like the chicken.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.917
- Glamor doesn't mean just like,
a certain kind of makeup.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.417
Glamor means like

12:36.417 --> 12:38.583
when Elizabeth Taylor
would lounge in a kaftan

12:38.625 --> 12:41.417
and a turban with like,
jewels on it, by the pool.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.958
Emilia, we'll be out here.
If you need me,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.333
let me know, okay?
- Okay.

12:46.292 --> 12:47.542
- Put your feet in.

12:48.917 --> 12:50.625
So, what's happening with you?

12:50.625 --> 12:52.083
- I'm healing.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.625
You know, I just, I'm trying
to figure things out right now

12:53.667 --> 12:54.875
and what I need to do,

12:54.917 --> 12:56.625
which direction I need to take
with my life.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.375
Five years ago I was diagnosed

12:58.417 --> 12:59.958
with rheumatoid arthritis.

12:59.958 --> 13:02.625
At that point,
I had 18 joints affected.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.958
Today, I have
32 joints affected.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.042
It's gotten worse,

13:06.083 --> 13:07.792
so they had to do surgery

13:07.792 --> 13:09.917
and remove tissue

13:09.958 --> 13:10.958
from around my tendons,

13:10.958 --> 13:12.208
so I can just move

13:12.250 --> 13:13.792
one of my fingers a little bit.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.625
- What are you doing
when you're at home?

13:15.667 --> 13:17.292
- I've gone back
into old tendencies

13:17.333 --> 13:18.458
where I'm like,

13:18.458 --> 13:20.000
drinking heavily.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.500
There's mornings I wake up

13:21.500 --> 13:22.833
and I want to start drinking

13:22.833 --> 13:24.125
because it's so much pain.

13:24.167 --> 13:26.667
Sometimes, the brain
just can't function.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.000
I don't know,
I'm in such a weird place

13:28.042 --> 13:29.250
in my life right now.

13:29.292 --> 13:30.500
Like, I could start crying...
- But babe...

13:30.500 --> 13:31.667
- ...in two seconds

13:31.708 --> 13:33.250
and then start yelling at you
in a second...

13:33.292 --> 13:34.417
I really...
- Do it, give it to me...

13:34.458 --> 13:35.833
- ...I'm like,
having menopause right now,

13:35.875 --> 13:37.292
I don't know what it is.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.583
- I've never heard you talk
like this, ever.

13:39.625 --> 13:40.958
- I isolate myself a lot

13:41.000 --> 13:42.125
because I'm in so much pain,

13:42.167 --> 13:43.167
I don't want people around me

13:43.208 --> 13:44.417
because I'm very bitter,

13:44.458 --> 13:45.833
I'm very nasty.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.917
- The real test, I think will be

13:47.958 --> 13:49.083
at shervin's, you know,

13:49.125 --> 13:50.417
birthday party.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.167
- Yeah.
- There's gonna be some stuff

13:52.167 --> 13:54.000
going on with Mike

13:54.000 --> 13:55.625
you might wanna react to.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.000
- Yeah, I think he's just got

13:57.000 --> 13:59.792
a little lost with Jessica.
- Yeah.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.542
- I'm just saying.
- Golnesa, let's not, let's not.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.208
- I literally,

14:03.208 --> 14:05.208
I still have so much

14:05.208 --> 14:08.500
unresolved feelings with her.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.042
She started this war

14:10.083 --> 14:11.792
and I will f---ing finish it.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.042
- We're gonna role play.

14:13.042 --> 14:14.708
Jessica comes up to you
and she goes,

14:14.708 --> 14:16.542
"yeah, you f---ing bitch,
you're a liar."

14:16.542 --> 14:18.500
- Get the f--- outta here.
- What the f---?

14:18.542 --> 14:19.625
That's the true...
- What?

14:19.667 --> 14:21.042
- That is the true test.
- No,

14:21.083 --> 14:22.792
ain't nobody gonna talk
to me like that.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.292
- Babe, you have to forgive her

14:24.333 --> 14:25.375
and she has to forgive you.

14:25.417 --> 14:27.208
Let's say she goes off on you,

14:27.208 --> 14:29.167
"f--- you, f---ing bitch,"

14:29.208 --> 14:30.875
you know, "f--- you,
you're a liar."

14:30.875 --> 14:33.125
- I'm gonna say, "please walk
away from me and calm down

14:33.167 --> 14:34.792
before you approach me
ever again."

14:34.833 --> 14:36.458
I can't communicate with someone

14:36.500 --> 14:38.125
who's gonna be on that level.

14:39.875 --> 14:40.917
- Damn.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.333
That was an omen, do you see?
- I love dragonflies.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.250
- That was an omen.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.417
- Hello.
- Hello.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.083
- How are you?

14:59.083 --> 15:00.583
- Did you recover
from the wedding?

15:00.583 --> 15:01.667
- Oh my goodness.
- Barely.

15:01.708 --> 15:02.750
- How was it?

15:02.792 --> 15:04.083
- It was amazing.
- Oh my goodness.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.542
I finished like,
two bottles of black label.

15:06.583 --> 15:09.542
- That's the first thing you say
about our wedding?

15:09.583 --> 15:11.208
- It was a lot of fun.
- This guy.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.333
I wake up the next morning

15:12.375 --> 15:13.500
at 8:00 A.M.

15:13.542 --> 15:15.083
He's on the floor, passed out

15:15.125 --> 15:16.500
with my eyelashes stuck

15:16.542 --> 15:18.500
to his back.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.708
- My wedding night was

15:20.750 --> 15:22.667
the best night of my life,

15:22.708 --> 15:24.458
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.625
I drank so much whiskey

15:26.667 --> 15:28.792
because I was just
on another level,

15:28.833 --> 15:30.625
I was like, euphoric.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.792
- So, this is our biggest album.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.792
- Okay, the bigger the better.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.458
- The price is $1,000

15:36.458 --> 15:37.708
for this album

15:39.417 --> 15:42.583
plus $500 for the design fee.

15:42.625 --> 15:45.292
- The amount of money
I spent on my photos,

15:45.292 --> 15:47.458
some people spend
on their f---ing wedding.

15:47.458 --> 15:48.958
- Yeah, this is what I want.

15:48.958 --> 15:51.542
- A persian wedding
is, you know,

15:51.583 --> 15:52.625
a few hundred grand.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.292
You've got flowers for like,

15:54.333 --> 15:55.958
40-50 grand.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.042
You got a band
that cost you 25 grand.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.542
The f---ing gold plates,

15:59.583 --> 16:00.625
I don't even know
what the f--- they're called,

16:00.625 --> 16:02.750
that sit under
your actual plates,

16:02.792 --> 16:03.792
you have to rent those.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.083
Rabbi, obviously you don't pay

16:05.125 --> 16:07.667
but he wants a donation,
donation.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.917
My tuxedo, tom Ford,

16:09.958 --> 16:13.417
$10,000.

16:13.458 --> 16:16.000
For a f---ing tuxedo.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.250
Oh f--- we spent
so much goddamn money.

16:18.292 --> 16:19.458
It's very expensive

16:20.500 --> 16:21.917
but the memories last

16:21.958 --> 16:23.458
a lifetime...

16:23.500 --> 16:26.333
At least that's what
my wife tells me.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.167
I really wanna see
the thank you video.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.500
There it is.
- I call it Michael.

16:30.542 --> 16:32.250
- Let's turn it up
and I wanna like...

16:32.292 --> 16:33.625
- Big screen.
- Yeah.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.667
- Oh man, marriage.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.333
Every action,

16:44.333 --> 16:45.667
every decision

16:45.667 --> 16:47.208
means something much greater

16:47.208 --> 16:48.792
than just myself now.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.042
You looked really hot there.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.833
It's gonna either take us higher

16:54.875 --> 16:56.708
or it's gonna bury us,

16:56.708 --> 16:58.375
so I have to be very cautious

16:58.417 --> 16:59.833
with everything that I do.

17:01.042 --> 17:03.042
- They say,
"when you know, you know,"

17:03.042 --> 17:04.333
but it wasn't until I met you

17:04.375 --> 17:06.042
that I actually believed that.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.167
- My only regret is that

17:07.208 --> 17:08.875
I didn't meet you sooner
in my life

17:08.875 --> 17:10.375
but from this day forward,

17:10.375 --> 17:11.375
I promise to be everything

17:11.417 --> 17:12.833
you could want in a husband.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.375
Damn,

17:16.375 --> 17:18.208
I do look good on TV.

17:19.375 --> 17:21.792
I should be on TV.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.208
- Woo.
- I love it.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.417
- I love this iced tea.

17:33.417 --> 17:35.375
Coconut white, your favorite.
- It's so good.

17:37.375 --> 17:38.375
- Hi, welcome guys.

17:38.417 --> 17:39.750
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:42.917 --> 17:45.000
- Look at this,
how amazing is that?

17:45.042 --> 17:46.833
- Yeah, I love it.
- These are like,

17:46.875 --> 17:47.917
15 grand.

17:47.917 --> 17:48.917
- So?

17:48.958 --> 17:51.250
What's that to a baller?
- Hey.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.583
- I love beautiful things.

17:52.583 --> 17:53.583
I mean, I'm a beautiful thing,

17:53.625 --> 17:55.250
so I like beautiful things.

17:55.292 --> 17:56.625
No, I'm kidding,
I'm not kidding.

17:57.583 --> 17:58.875
- Lots to look at, huh?

17:58.917 --> 18:00.417
- There's a lot to take in.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.083
- Welcome, I'm Justin.
- Reza.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.167
- Nice to meet you as well.
- How are you?

18:03.208 --> 18:04.833
- Justin.
- I like that.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.417
- Yes. I love these birds.

18:06.458 --> 18:08.417
- I just bought a house
in palm Springs,

18:08.417 --> 18:09.708
so I just wanna like,

18:09.750 --> 18:11.375
get some stuff

18:11.417 --> 18:12.792
to inspire me.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.542
Work has been great,

18:14.583 --> 18:15.875
I've been selling more

18:15.917 --> 18:17.458
than I've ever sold

18:17.500 --> 18:18.750
but the beauty is,

18:18.792 --> 18:20.458
I'm actually doing a lot

18:20.458 --> 18:22.708
of the remodeling
for my clients.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.958
You know I'm obsessed
with this lucite.

18:24.958 --> 18:27.125
And in fact, I'm remodeling

18:27.125 --> 18:29.750
my favorite client's home
right now.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.708
And guess who
my favorite client is?

18:32.750 --> 18:33.958
- Your lucite collection

18:34.000 --> 18:35.958
is already like, vast.

18:35.958 --> 18:36.958
- Can a bitch get

18:37.000 --> 18:38.625
his back scratched?
- No.

18:38.625 --> 18:40.042
- They look
really good together.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.458
So,

18:41.500 --> 18:43.042
I need you to do something.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.375
- Okay.
- You know

18:44.417 --> 18:46.083
Adam and I went through
a crazy period.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.292
- Yes.
- You were there, obviously,

18:47.292 --> 18:48.625
you helped me through it.

18:48.667 --> 18:50.958
We're in a much,
much better place now.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.125
- Love that.
- So,

18:52.167 --> 18:54.667
I'm totally ready

18:54.708 --> 18:56.417
to get married now.

18:58.292 --> 18:59.417
Yeah.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.833
- What?
- And here's where you come in.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.167
I need your help.

19:03.167 --> 19:04.292
I would like you to do

19:04.333 --> 19:06.000
whatever is necessary

19:06.000 --> 19:07.625
to be able to officiate

19:07.667 --> 19:09.792
the ceremony.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.458
Do you accept the challenge?
- I love...

19:11.500 --> 19:12.750
Yes.

19:12.792 --> 19:13.833
Rez,

19:13.833 --> 19:16.000
I'm so happy for you guys.

19:16.042 --> 19:17.167
This is like

19:17.167 --> 19:18.625
the most beautiful ballad

19:18.667 --> 19:19.833
to my ears right now.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.625
I mean, you don't know how long

19:21.667 --> 19:23.167
we've all been waiting for Reza

19:23.167 --> 19:24.958
to be ready.
- Because we just bought

19:25.000 --> 19:26.167
this house in palm Springs,

19:26.167 --> 19:27.333
I would love

19:27.333 --> 19:28.458
if we were there

19:28.500 --> 19:29.958
like, for a weekend.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.167
Let's go have fun.

19:31.167 --> 19:32.583
Out of the blue,

19:32.625 --> 19:35.417
boom, a surprise ceremony.

19:36.417 --> 19:38.042
- I...Babe, I love that.

19:38.083 --> 19:40.042
This is making me like,

19:40.042 --> 19:41.833
like my heart is crying.
- You know, it's just like,

19:41.875 --> 19:44.375
took a long time
for us to get here.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.667
- I'm so proud of you.
- But like,

19:45.708 --> 19:47.167
I want to do it now.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.833
All those issues I was having,

19:48.875 --> 19:50.875
all the fears and like, anxiety.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.208
All of that is gone.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.708
How amazing would it be

19:53.708 --> 19:54.958
if you had been wanting

19:55.000 --> 19:56.542
to get married

19:56.583 --> 19:57.875
and then all of a sudden,

19:57.875 --> 20:00.375
your man is like, "surprise,

20:00.417 --> 20:01.542
here's the wedding."

20:04.042 --> 20:05.375
- That's a persian wedding song,

20:05.375 --> 20:07.708
if you were wondering
why we're singing it.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.625
$1,362.06
- for a bunch of plexiglass?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.708
- I think
this is gonna catch on.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.792
All of a sudden,
it's gonna be the thing

20:14.833 --> 20:15.833
that people are doing.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.042
F--- flash mobs,

20:17.083 --> 20:18.750
it's gonna be flash weddings.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.750
- I love these guys.

20:20.792 --> 20:23.333
I just wish they had more
of a persian nose though.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.208
Can you talk to Jonathan?
We need some like, ethnic ones.

20:25.250 --> 20:28.250
- Absolutely,
we will let him know.

20:28.250 --> 20:29.542
- Coming up...
- I don't know

20:29.583 --> 20:31.583
what I'm gonna wear.
I just know that white

20:31.625 --> 20:33.042
is a lot of f---ing pressure

20:33.083 --> 20:34.750
and I probably have my period.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.917
- I've had
so many emotions built up.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.417
I want you to feel how I feel.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.083
- Hello.
- Oh wow.

20:53.125 --> 20:55.167
- Oh, look who it is.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.083
- Ow.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.708
- What up, geej?

20:58.750 --> 21:00.458
How you doing?
- I'm good.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.208
- Cousin-joon.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.375
- Nima and I
being cousins is awesome,

21:04.417 --> 21:06.125
so we've become super close

21:06.167 --> 21:08.083
and then sherv's like,
his best friend,

21:08.125 --> 21:10.083
so he and I have
become super close

21:10.125 --> 21:11.875
and we've established
the really like,

21:11.917 --> 21:13.458
brother-sister bond.

21:13.458 --> 21:15.458
- You want some fruit
or some nuts or...

21:15.458 --> 21:17.625
I know you like nuts
in your mouth, you want some?

21:17.625 --> 21:19.417
- Can you warm 'em up the way
I really like 'em?

21:19.458 --> 21:21.042
- No, no, I ain't gonna do that.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.958
You warm yourselves
but help yourself.

21:22.958 --> 21:24.042
It's my birthday

21:24.083 --> 21:25.208
and I'm turning 35.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.042
It's that number
where that's it,

21:27.083 --> 21:28.458
it's official,
I'm no longer a kid.

21:28.458 --> 21:30.625
I can never use the excuse
"well, I'm young."

21:30.667 --> 21:33.125
- Have sherv wait on us.
- Yeah, sherv can wait in here,

21:33.167 --> 21:34.958
it's not like
it's his f---ing birthday.

21:34.958 --> 21:36.708
- I'm gonna drink
my sorrows away on this one

21:36.750 --> 21:38.458
but I'm still single

21:38.458 --> 21:39.667
and I'm gonna enjoy it.

21:39.708 --> 21:41.167
I decided, let's get a yacht,

21:41.208 --> 21:42.500
let's make it a white party.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.667
Here are the drinks,
let's get started, do it.

21:43.708 --> 21:45.125
- Let's get started.

21:45.167 --> 21:46.583
- Cheers to your birthday.
- Cheers to your birthday.

21:46.625 --> 21:47.667
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

21:47.667 --> 21:49.333
- Let's feel
like we're in Saint-tropez

21:49.333 --> 21:50.833
but we're in San Diego.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.250
- Let's go get freaking ready.

21:52.292 --> 21:53.333
You know how I am
about being on time,

21:53.333 --> 21:54.625
let's go.

21:54.667 --> 21:55.667
don't complain about the drink.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.000
- What's the purple stuff?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.500
- I had Barney jerk off
in the cup

21:58.542 --> 22:00.500
for you, let's go.
- F---.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.833
- Oh wait, she needs her stuff

22:01.833 --> 22:03.333
gg's definitely
one of the dudes.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.667
We're the two in the group
that are kind

22:04.708 --> 22:06.792
of in the same boat.
Let's see what you're wearing

22:06.833 --> 22:08.500
what if it looks stupid?
- Let me see what you guys

22:08.500 --> 22:10.792
are wearing.
- We're both single,

22:10.833 --> 22:12.500
everybody else
is in a relationship,

22:12.500 --> 22:14.000
and so that's why I enjoy
hanging out with her,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.292
she's always ready
to have a good time.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.333
- Look at me
I'm feeling like maybe

22:18.375 --> 22:20.167
if you were crossing over

22:20.167 --> 22:22.500
to the other side,

22:22.542 --> 22:24.875
like if you were gay perhaps.

22:24.875 --> 22:27.375
- Okay, fair enough.

22:27.417 --> 22:29.042
Hey, listen,
you just have to say,

22:29.042 --> 22:31.708
"no, you know, something else."

22:31.750 --> 22:33.042
- You know,
people always ask me,

22:33.042 --> 22:34.333
"is shervin gay?"
All the time,

22:34.375 --> 22:35.875
so it's like, I feel like--yes.
- What?

22:35.875 --> 22:37.708
What do you mean?
- I think because of the way

22:37.750 --> 22:40.667
you dress and your hair
is always really pretty

22:40.708 --> 22:43.208
and...
- So, here's the bad news.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.333
This thing's a little fitted,
I need help taking it off.

22:45.375 --> 22:46.542
- Alright, hey, this one...

22:46.583 --> 22:48.042
- Guys, I need help.
- After that statement,

22:48.083 --> 22:49.667
that one's all you.
- ...It doesn't come off.

22:49.708 --> 22:51.333
- I can't help you,
I mean, I'm...

22:51.375 --> 22:53.708
- Use one hand.
- That's what he said.

22:53.708 --> 22:55.542
- Get it off.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.875
- Dude, seriously.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.625
- Just get it off.
- Alright, stop moving.

22:58.667 --> 23:00.708
Oh my god.
- Ouch.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.292
- What.
- don't pull on my hair.

23:02.333 --> 23:04.333
- Oh my god.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.833
Oh my god.

23:06.875 --> 23:08.083
- Alright, this one sucked, too.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.042
- Alright, hurry up
and let's go please.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.708
Bring the vodka in the car.
- Let's do this.

23:19.458 --> 23:21.375
- White party.

23:22.625 --> 23:23.875
Wow, that's really hot.

23:23.917 --> 23:25.083
- Do you like it?
- Mm-hmm.

23:25.083 --> 23:27.125
- Tuck and pull hard.

23:28.083 --> 23:29.917
I have bruises all over.

23:29.958 --> 23:31.417
- Why?

23:31.417 --> 23:32.833
- I mean,
I know you like it rough

23:32.875 --> 23:35.708
but that was intense.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.375
I love you.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.375
- What's up?
- What up?

23:46.417 --> 23:47.875
- You're all in black.

23:47.917 --> 23:50.292
Babe.
- I just came from the gym.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.083
- I need a drink
do you need one?

23:52.125 --> 23:53.417
- Yes, please.
- Let's do this.

23:53.458 --> 23:55.208
- Let me go
put my outfit on for you

23:55.250 --> 23:57.292
and you tell me what you think.
- ...Go put it on in my office.

23:57.292 --> 24:01.292
- I'm gonna bring you some
Saint-tropez right now.

24:01.292 --> 24:02.417
- So, look,

24:02.458 --> 24:05.458
I'm all about you
voicing your opinion,

24:05.458 --> 24:06.625
sticking up for yourself

24:06.625 --> 24:09.875
and really letting people know
how you feel.

24:09.917 --> 24:13.542
But as much as I hate
what happened,

24:13.583 --> 24:16.292
I think it's important
that we bridge this gap

24:16.292 --> 24:18.625
to one another and we really
become friends again.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.625
- I'm not gonna walk in
and be fake and say,

24:20.625 --> 24:23.292
"oh my gosh, hi."
- Reza and Adam,

24:23.292 --> 24:26.333
Asa, Bobby, and asifa
were at my wedding.

24:26.333 --> 24:29.458
Other than that, I haven't
seen these guys in a long time.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.917
- I'm ready to move on.

24:30.958 --> 24:33.125
But you never know
how gg's gonna be.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.292
It's either a loose Cannon

24:34.333 --> 24:36.292
or a sane, calm person.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.750
It's hit or miss.
- I get that,

24:37.792 --> 24:39.667
I understand, I understand.
Let's go, baby.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.333
You look so hot, I love you.

24:47.292 --> 24:48.750
- Bam.

24:48.792 --> 24:50.000
- What the...
- Yeah,

24:50.000 --> 24:51.583
Saint-tropez, baby.
- Rez.

24:51.625 --> 24:54.583
- That's the only...
- That is 100% Saint-tropez,

24:54.625 --> 24:56.000
you're right.
- This is the only white outfit

24:56.000 --> 24:59.167
I had #sainttropez, biatch.
- It's amazing.

24:59.208 --> 25:01.250
Woo.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.167
- Hi. Wow.

25:03.167 --> 25:05.250
- Why aren't you wearing white?
- I thought we were getting

25:05.292 --> 25:07.000
ready here.
- Oh yes, come get ready.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.292
Yeah, like
- I'm so glad you're wearing

25:08.333 --> 25:09.792
that, you have no idea.

25:09.833 --> 25:12.500
Mwah, mwah.

25:12.542 --> 25:13.542
Well, should I
just try this on?

25:13.583 --> 25:14.875
- That's really cute, yeah.
- Yeah.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.083
- Go throw it on.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.542
- This looks like it might work.
- It's like a babydoll thing,

25:21.583 --> 25:23.708
that's the style of it.
- You guys, ya-Allah.

25:23.708 --> 25:26.125
- Ya-Allah let's go.
- I'll bring my rings,

25:26.167 --> 25:27.667
I'll put it on in the car.
- Ya-Allah, in the car.

25:27.708 --> 25:28.958
- Do you guys wanna get
your drinks to go?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.208
- In the car.
- Oh yeah.

25:30.208 --> 25:31.375
- Let's roll.
- Okay,

25:31.375 --> 25:33.542
I'm taking a secondary outfit.

25:36.750 --> 25:38.542
- Can we stop on the way,
you guys,

25:38.542 --> 25:40.875
get something to go?
I'm serious, like, I'm starving.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.542
- Cheers.
- We had to stop to pee,

25:44.542 --> 25:46.375
we had to stop for beverages,

25:46.417 --> 25:47.958
we had to stop for food,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.750
we had to stop for them
to stretch their legs out.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.000
You guys, we're super late.

25:53.042 --> 25:55.042
It took us forever.

25:56.583 --> 25:57.917
- I need time.

25:57.917 --> 25:59.250
I don't know
what I'm gonna wear.

25:59.250 --> 26:00.417
I just know that white

26:00.458 --> 26:01.875
is a lot of f---ing pressure

26:01.917 --> 26:04.208
and I probably have my period.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.375
I'm not wearing this.

26:05.417 --> 26:06.833
- Why?
- Why?

26:06.875 --> 26:09.667
- What I need is that dress.

26:09.708 --> 26:12.250
- Dude, we're f---ing late.

26:12.250 --> 26:13.250
- Oh sh--.

26:13.292 --> 26:15.500
- What?
- I have to cut the bottom.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.708
- What is this, arts and crafts
in your f---ing bag?

26:17.750 --> 26:19.667
- Right quick. Right here.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.833
That's the finish line,
you're getting short--longer,

26:21.875 --> 26:24.875
you're getting too long.
- Merce, it's so f---ing thick.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.042
- Because it needs to be faster.
- Oh god.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.208
- Okay, good, good, good...
- It's not sharp enough.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.083
I don't know why
this bitch is assuming

26:31.125 --> 26:32.250
I'm the seamstress

26:32.292 --> 26:35.042
but I'm ready to cut
her dress in half.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.917
She's lucky I don't cut one
of her titties off.

26:53.167 --> 26:56.042
- What's up buddy?
- Oh, this is really nice.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.917
- I don't have any anxiety

27:05.958 --> 27:07.792
about seeing Mike and Jessica,

27:07.792 --> 27:11.083
I have anxiety
that we're all gonna be trapped

27:11.125 --> 27:13.167
on a boat with alcohol

27:13.167 --> 27:15.000
for an extended period of time.

27:15.042 --> 27:16.667
You know, they're wild cards,

27:16.667 --> 27:18.167
sh-- can happen.

27:18.208 --> 27:19.500
- Sheikh, please.

27:19.542 --> 27:20.958
- Hey.
- Hello.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.167
- Saddam Hussein.

27:22.167 --> 27:23.250
- Oh.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.125
- How are you?
- How are you?

27:26.167 --> 27:28.000
- I'm great, how are you?
- Long time, no see.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.333
- Yeah man, looking good.
- Good to see you.

27:29.333 --> 27:30.833
- I swear to god
I was gonna wear this.

27:30.833 --> 27:33.333
- You know why?
He said Saint-tropez style.

27:33.375 --> 27:36.958
What's more Saint-tropez
than an arab on a yacht?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.500
- When I finally saw everybody,

27:38.500 --> 27:40.458
I realized, man,
this is not as awkward

27:40.500 --> 27:41.833
as I thought
it was gonna be. I'm like,

27:41.875 --> 27:43.458
"oh, these are my friends "

27:43.500 --> 27:45.333
- Captain.

27:45.375 --> 27:47.333
- It's cool,
it's like I get to hang out

27:47.333 --> 27:49.500
with them again.
- You guys need fireball shots.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.792
- Tequila for me,
chilled I'll be right back,

27:51.833 --> 27:53.333
I have to check my outfit.
- You look great.

27:53.333 --> 27:54.500
You don't need to go anywhere,
swear to god, babe.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.708
- I need to look for myself
so that I'm okay.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.375
- This needs to be down more,
I don't know why the f---

27:58.375 --> 27:59.750
that's happening there.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.333
You alright?
- Of course.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.667
Hi.
- Hi,

28:06.708 --> 28:07.875
how are you?
- Good, how are you?

28:07.875 --> 28:11.708
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

28:11.708 --> 28:13.125
- We're moving.

28:17.375 --> 28:19.042
- It's shervin's birthday,
where's shervin?

28:19.042 --> 28:21.042
- What are we drinking?
- We're drinking Tequila

28:21.042 --> 28:22.208
right when we get onto that boat

28:22.208 --> 28:23.208
but here's the thing, right now,

28:23.250 --> 28:24.375
the boat's taking off

28:24.375 --> 28:26.375
and people are starting
to ask questions.

28:26.375 --> 28:28.250
- Why are we moving
without them?

28:30.833 --> 28:33.542
Did the boat really leave
without party boy?

28:36.208 --> 28:38.042
- I know
this is sherv's birthday

28:38.083 --> 28:40.250
but I have to say,
I'm very happy

28:40.250 --> 28:42.375
to be around my people

28:42.417 --> 28:44.500
and have my people around me.

28:47.083 --> 28:48.375
- Cheers.
- Salamati

28:48.417 --> 28:49.750
- salamati.
- Cheers.

28:49.792 --> 28:51.500
Cheers. Cheers.

28:53.583 --> 28:55.083
- This is cool,
it's not as weird

28:55.083 --> 28:56.500
as I thought
it was gonna be you know,

28:56.542 --> 28:58.833
there's m-jizzle, Reza,

28:58.875 --> 29:01.375
Asa, but no Golnesa

29:01.417 --> 29:03.833
that's not necessarily
a bad thing

29:03.875 --> 29:05.208
and the birthday boy,

29:05.250 --> 29:07.375
he's nowhere to be found.
I'm calling shervin.

29:07.417 --> 29:09.042
He's not answering.
- Weird.

29:15.417 --> 29:17.542
- Wait, where's sherv?

29:19.125 --> 29:21.708
- That would be f---ing dope
if that's him.

29:27.458 --> 29:28.917
- Wait.

29:29.917 --> 29:31.625
- That would be f---ing dope

29:31.625 --> 29:32.958
if that's him.

29:32.958 --> 29:35.750
That would be very, very Alpha.

29:35.792 --> 29:37.292
- Throw it up for shervin.

29:37.292 --> 29:39.458
This is amazing,
just when you thought

29:39.458 --> 29:41.625
he's exceeded your expectations,

29:41.625 --> 29:42.875
stop, start over,

29:42.917 --> 29:44.083
he's not even done yet.

29:44.125 --> 29:46.083
- The plane, the plane.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.750
- I feel like a bride
is coming out

29:57.792 --> 30:00.083
or something, you know? Yeah.

30:00.125 --> 30:02.167
- Yay.

30:05.833 --> 30:07.750
Oh, and you have Golnesa
with you.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.417
F---ing shervin

30:12.458 --> 30:14.292
- what up!

30:14.333 --> 30:16.667
This yacht
is absolutely gorgeous,

30:16.667 --> 30:17.750
$30 million

30:17.792 --> 30:20.083
of amazing gorgeous decks,

30:20.125 --> 30:21.292
gorgeous jacuzzi,

30:21.333 --> 30:23.000
gorgeous everything.
- We made it.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.292
- Hey, we landed safely.
- And I'm very...

30:24.333 --> 30:26.000
- We're still here.
- Hey, happy birthday,

30:26.000 --> 30:27.250
I'm glad everything worked out.
- Happy birthday.

30:27.292 --> 30:28.542
Love you.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.833
I wish we had straws

30:31.833 --> 30:33.958
- a 35-year-old persian man

30:34.000 --> 30:35.500
is supposed to be married

30:35.500 --> 30:37.000
with two kids.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.417
I'm definitely not there.

30:38.458 --> 30:39.958
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, sherv.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
- Yeah.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.708
- But what I do have

30:45.708 --> 30:47.542
is a 160-foot yacht,

30:47.542 --> 30:49.958
a helicopter, mermaids,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.208
everybody dressed in white,

30:51.208 --> 30:53.125
an open bar, food

30:53.167 --> 30:55.375
and 35 grand to drop on a party.

30:55.375 --> 30:58.000
- What an entrance, bro.
How did you think of this?

31:01.042 --> 31:02.125
Hi.
- Hey.

31:02.167 --> 31:03.792
- How are you?
- I'm good, captain...

31:03.833 --> 31:05.208
- You still have that thing
on your hand, huh?

31:05.208 --> 31:06.625
- Oh, for a long time.
- Yeah,

31:06.667 --> 31:08.125
I haven't been this close

31:08.167 --> 31:10.208
to Golnesa in a really long time

31:10.250 --> 31:12.292
and I have tons
of emotions running through me

31:12.333 --> 31:14.708
but I gotta let that sh-- go,

31:14.708 --> 31:17.125
I've had so many fireball shots.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.375
- I've been expecting
to see Mike here.

31:19.375 --> 31:20.875
I'm glad that he's trying
to move forward

31:20.917 --> 31:22.208
because I am as well.

31:22.250 --> 31:24.500
- Shervin-joon, how old are you?

31:24.542 --> 31:25.875
- I'm 35.

31:25.917 --> 31:28.417
- And what would you like
in this new year of yours?

31:28.417 --> 31:30.250
- A lot.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.917
But mostly
I would like health, right?

31:31.917 --> 31:33.917
- He gets out of a helicopter
onto a yacht

31:33.917 --> 31:35.708
and he says, "I'd like a lot."

31:42.250 --> 31:44.667
- What's going on?
- Rez, it's been a minute.

31:44.708 --> 31:46.750
- It's been like, two minutes.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.333
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

31:48.375 --> 31:50.917
- Just life, man.

31:50.958 --> 31:52.583
I don't wanna do it today
but we definitely need

31:52.583 --> 31:55.333
to sit down and like,
hash some sh-- out.

31:55.375 --> 31:58.208
- Mike, me and your sh--?
- Yeah.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.542
Not just me and your sh--,
just all this sh--

32:01.583 --> 32:03.875
and put it to rest.
- Mike used to be

32:03.917 --> 32:05.125
a big part of my life

32:05.167 --> 32:07.417
and we went through some hell

32:07.458 --> 32:09.375
but more than that,

32:09.417 --> 32:10.708
we have a lot of good times

32:10.750 --> 32:11.792
behind us as well.

32:11.792 --> 32:14.625
I'm very much bored

32:14.667 --> 32:16.208
with any conversation

32:16.250 --> 32:18.083
that has to do...
- With my dool?

32:18.125 --> 32:20.917
- With this area
if you wanna talk about sh--

32:20.958 --> 32:22.375
moving forward...
- Yes.

32:22.417 --> 32:24.417
- All day long, all day long...
- Enough, enough.

32:24.458 --> 32:25.750
- ...I'm down with you.
- Enough.

32:25.792 --> 32:28.250
Me and Reza for sure
have some unfinished business

32:28.292 --> 32:30.458
we have to take care of
but f--- that,

32:30.458 --> 32:32.458
we need to f---ing
get this party going.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.417
This summer's
gonna get kicked off right here,

32:34.458 --> 32:36.250
right now, with this drink
I'm about to have.

32:36.292 --> 32:38.125
Salut.
We're gonna have a blast.

32:39.417 --> 32:41.125
You drink that and you chase it
with a little vodky.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.375
We'll f---ing handle
our differences later.

32:49.833 --> 32:52.667
Can we have fireballs
for everybody?

32:52.667 --> 32:54.833
- He's had six drinks
since we got here.

33:01.375 --> 33:03.500
- I don't do that, Reza.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.292
- Yeah,
this is not strong enough.

33:06.333 --> 33:08.625
Vodka, little soda,

33:08.667 --> 33:12.333
little soda and a lot of lime.

33:12.375 --> 33:13.792
- What are you doing?
- I'm so sweet myself,

33:13.833 --> 33:15.292
I need more sour in my life.

33:15.333 --> 33:16.500
- Brian.
- Nice to meet you.

33:16.542 --> 33:18.667
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Can you take your glasses off

33:18.667 --> 33:20.667
really fast?
Oh, so you're cute.

33:20.708 --> 33:23.667
Are you Irish?
- Scot-Irish, yeah.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.167
- Did you make a stiff one?

33:25.208 --> 33:26.292
Thank you.

33:26.333 --> 33:28.542
- Has--did Golnesa go--
say hi to you?

33:28.542 --> 33:30.167
- Uh, yeah.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.375
- You know she has an issue
with me, right?

33:33.375 --> 33:34.667
- Yeah.

33:46.375 --> 33:48.000
- Hey, everything cool?

33:48.042 --> 33:49.042
- Uh-oh.
- Are you good?

33:49.083 --> 33:51.167
- Yeah, it's fine,
it's like Jessica's here

33:51.208 --> 33:53.958
and it's like...
- I want amends to be made.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.500
I want, on my birthday,

33:55.542 --> 33:57.375
I want people
to kind of squash it out,

33:57.375 --> 33:58.792
lay it out.
- That's what I'm saying,

33:58.833 --> 34:00.542
I don't know
where her mindset is right now.

34:00.583 --> 34:02.042
- Okay, how about this,

34:02.042 --> 34:03.708
I'll call her over
so she doesn't feel like

34:03.708 --> 34:04.833
she's being ganged up on.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.625
I think that
there are some loose ends

34:06.667 --> 34:09.042
amongst the group
in relation to Golnesa

34:09.042 --> 34:13.083
that have caused them
to somewhat isolate her.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.417
I'm hoping to break the ice

34:14.417 --> 34:16.542
and reestablish
those lost connections.

34:16.583 --> 34:17.750
You wanna do that?

34:17.750 --> 34:19.250
- Okay.
- You wanna sit here?

34:19.250 --> 34:20.708
- Yeah.
- Okay, let me go get her.

34:20.750 --> 34:22.833
- I never personally

34:22.875 --> 34:24.917
started any problems
with Jessica.

34:24.917 --> 34:26.375
- I think if you guys
make amends,

34:26.417 --> 34:28.375
it's kind of a gift to me.

34:28.417 --> 34:30.250
- My issue was with Mike,

34:30.292 --> 34:32.375
before there was ever
an engagement

34:32.417 --> 34:34.208
or a wedding or anything.

34:34.250 --> 34:36.042
- Golnesa-joon,

34:36.083 --> 34:38.250
Jess, come sit down.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.875
So, me and nima are gonna--

34:39.917 --> 34:41.583
we'll be right over here, okay?
- Okay.

34:41.583 --> 34:44.000
- It's my birthday.
- Hey, this is his birthday.

34:44.042 --> 34:45.208
- I want a gift here.
- Think about that, too.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.625
- I want my gift.

34:49.708 --> 34:51.708
- Coming up.
- I turned into the bitch,

34:51.750 --> 34:53.458
I turned into
the f---ing crazy one.

34:53.458 --> 34:54.958
- Dude, stop.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.042
- F---.
- Did you just put your hands

34:56.083 --> 34:57.708
on me?
- What is going on

34:57.750 --> 34:59.083
in gg's world?

34:59.125 --> 35:01.292
What are you
so angry about, bitch?

35:01.292 --> 35:10.250
- Swim, take a swim, bye.
- Let's go over here.

35:11.625 --> 35:12.958
- Jess, come sit down.

35:12.958 --> 35:14.458
So, me and nima are gonna--

35:14.458 --> 35:16.583
we'll be right over here, okay?
- Okay.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.625
- Hey, this is his birthday.
- I want a gift here.

35:18.625 --> 35:20.292
- Think about that, too.
- I want my gift.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.542
- Shervin,
as my brother, asked me

35:22.583 --> 35:25.125
if I can make up with this girl
and I said yes.

35:25.125 --> 35:27.583
I'm doing it for him,
for myself

35:27.625 --> 35:28.958
and for everyone else.

35:28.958 --> 35:31.083
So, can you tell me
if someone comes by,

35:31.125 --> 35:32.750
because if they do,
I honest to god

35:32.792 --> 35:34.083
will end
the f---ing conversation

35:34.125 --> 35:35.833
because I really
don't want an audience.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.292
- Yeah, completely.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.667
I've been wanting to talk to you
for a really long time,

35:39.667 --> 35:41.500
I just never felt

35:41.500 --> 35:43.250
like it was the right time
and I don't even know

35:43.292 --> 35:46.083
if this is the right time.
But for the last year,

35:46.125 --> 35:48.417
I've had so many emotions
built up.

35:48.458 --> 35:50.833
But, I want you to hear my side
of the story

35:50.833 --> 35:52.833
and how I feel.
- 100%.

35:52.833 --> 35:54.667
- Last year,

35:54.667 --> 35:56.583
I walked into a party

35:56.625 --> 35:58.083
I've never in my life

35:58.125 --> 36:00.833
been more shocked
and caught off-guard, ever.

36:00.833 --> 36:03.000
I would never in a million years

36:03.000 --> 36:06.417
think that that was gonna
come out of your mouth, ever.

36:06.458 --> 36:07.833
- I just don't like you.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.333
- It's okay, go f--- yourself.
- Okay.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.833
No, you kept trying to f--- me

36:10.833 --> 36:12.167
in Turkey, bitch.
You were the one

36:12.167 --> 36:13.792
trying to do that.

36:19.542 --> 36:22.958
I had literally zero control

36:23.000 --> 36:24.875
over myself that day.

36:24.875 --> 36:26.375
- Say it happened,

36:26.417 --> 36:27.792
I can get over that

36:27.833 --> 36:28.958
we're f---ing married now,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.042
whatever you said happened
has no relevance

36:31.042 --> 36:33.042
in my life, we are married.
- That's the whole point
exactly.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.875
- But what does it matter
to you?

36:34.875 --> 36:38.208
- ...it doesn't.
- Imagine one of your friends

36:38.208 --> 36:40.208
you're in
a serious relationship,

36:40.250 --> 36:42.208
a few days away
from being engaged.

36:42.208 --> 36:44.708
I feel like
the tables completely turned

36:44.708 --> 36:47.542
and everyone,
instead of blaming the person

36:47.542 --> 36:49.542
who was claimed
to be the bad person,

36:49.542 --> 36:51.458
I turned into the bad person.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.958
I turned into the bitch,

36:53.000 --> 36:54.708
I turned
into the f---ing crazy one.

36:54.708 --> 36:56.208
Honestly.
- I'm not trying to hurt you,

36:56.250 --> 36:58.917
Jessica, and I'm so sorry I did

36:58.958 --> 37:01.083
and I would like it for one day

37:01.083 --> 37:03.417
that we can just get to here...

37:03.458 --> 37:05.042
- Golnesa.

37:05.083 --> 37:06.875
- I'm not doing this
in front of anybody

37:06.917 --> 37:08.042
people are walking down.

37:08.083 --> 37:10.083
I feel like this conversation
with Jessica

37:10.083 --> 37:12.375
went well
but it's gonna take awhile

37:12.417 --> 37:15.042
and I don't want anyone
chiming in,

37:15.083 --> 37:16.250
giving their two-cents,

37:16.250 --> 37:18.083
talking sh-- or anything.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.667
- I'm happy you guys
are talking.

37:19.708 --> 37:21.250
- Yeah,
we're just chit-chatting.

37:21.292 --> 37:22.583
I wanted to sit with Jessica

37:22.625 --> 37:23.875
and handle this one-on-one.

37:23.917 --> 37:25.333
But it just didn't work

37:25.375 --> 37:26.750
- thank you for ruining
my conversation.

37:26.792 --> 37:29.542
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:30.792 --> 37:33.167
- Can I have four shots
of Tequila?

37:34.542 --> 37:36.708
Eat some f---ing chips
and be happy.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.750
- Can I get my drink
and then can we walk away?

37:38.792 --> 37:40.292
I'm about to fall,

37:40.292 --> 37:41.625
I'm drunk.

37:41.625 --> 37:43.417
Hello everybody.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.917
Did you make it a stiff one?

37:44.958 --> 37:46.292
I appreciate that, thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.083
- I'm no one to judge anyone
on drinking.

37:48.125 --> 37:49.958
I love to drink,
I love to have a good time.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.125
- Of course you do.

37:52.167 --> 37:53.792
- Golnesa pre-drinks,

37:53.792 --> 37:55.750
then post-drinks

37:55.792 --> 37:57.958
and after party drinks

37:58.000 --> 37:59.458
and then morning drinks

37:59.458 --> 38:01.250
and then afternoon drinks.

38:01.292 --> 38:03.458
- I have to pee
before I f---ing jump off

38:03.500 --> 38:05.125
this f---ing boat.
- Hold on.

38:05.125 --> 38:07.458
- I think
she may have a problem.

38:07.458 --> 38:09.417
- Please walk me
to the f---ing bathroom.

38:09.458 --> 38:10.458
- Just go one down more.

38:10.458 --> 38:11.792
- No, I need to pee.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.458
- Yo.
- Oh.

38:17.125 --> 38:19.292
- We're having a toast
to shervin's birthday.

38:19.292 --> 38:21.458
Everybody has one?
- I don't drink korbel.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.500
- Salamati.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.833
- Salamati.
- Happy birthday.

38:27.167 --> 38:28.917
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:30.333 --> 38:32.292
- There was
this common denominator

38:32.333 --> 38:34.167
that everybody was kind
of coming there for,

38:34.167 --> 38:35.625
which was me and my birthday,

38:35.667 --> 38:37.167
that allowed everybody
just to kind of let go

38:37.167 --> 38:38.292
of whatever was going on.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.792
- What I really want this year,

38:41.833 --> 38:43.500
other than the standard health

38:43.542 --> 38:45.125
and happiness and love
and wealth,

38:45.167 --> 38:46.750
I want everybody
to be good, right?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.500
And that's what
I wanna cheers to.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.167
That's what I really wanted
for my birthday,

38:50.208 --> 38:51.583
I wanted the solidarity.

38:51.625 --> 38:53.500
- You guys, I seriously,

38:53.500 --> 38:55.083
the one thing I wanna say is,

38:55.125 --> 38:56.292
first of all, sherv,

38:56.333 --> 38:58.833
I wanna wish you
a happy birthday

38:58.875 --> 39:00.792
and many more to come,
- thank you.

39:00.833 --> 39:02.292
- And I love you guys,

39:02.333 --> 39:03.708
you guys are my family

39:03.750 --> 39:06.625
and I love
when we're all together.

39:06.667 --> 39:07.875
- Me too.
- Yeah.

39:07.875 --> 39:09.125
- Amen.
- Can I get a hallelujah?

39:09.167 --> 39:10.792
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.625
My people are together.

39:13.708 --> 39:14.792
- Moses.

39:16.208 --> 39:18.167
- Oh god, not today, not today.
- Go, go, go, go.

39:18.208 --> 39:19.208
- Oh, hell no.

39:19.250 --> 39:22.125
- don't babe, what the f---?

39:22.167 --> 39:24.625
Dude, why would you do that?

39:24.667 --> 39:25.833
- What happened?
- This is a f---ing

39:25.875 --> 39:28.500
$3,000 dress.
- Return it.

39:32.875 --> 39:33.875
- She just said...
- Golnesa,

39:33.875 --> 39:34.958
why would do that?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.708
Why would you throw cake on me?

39:36.750 --> 39:38.833
- What are you talking about?
- You just threw cake at me.

39:38.875 --> 39:40.958
- I didn't do sh--.
- don't throw cake on me,

39:41.000 --> 39:42.375
I'm serious.
don't throw anything at me.

39:42.417 --> 39:43.542
- Woo woo.
- Hey, does anyone wanna taste.

39:43.542 --> 39:44.750
- What are you gonna do?
- Mike, Mike, Mike.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.333
- I'm asking you nicely,
don't throw cake at me.

39:46.375 --> 39:47.917
- I didn't throw sh--.
- Yes you did, I just saw you.

39:47.958 --> 39:49.500
- Woo.
- Babe, but asifa,

39:49.542 --> 39:50.667
- can you just--
can you walk away?

39:50.708 --> 39:52.083
- I don't.
- The cake is over here.

39:52.083 --> 39:54.083
- Walk away, walk away.
- She threw a piece of it

39:54.083 --> 39:56.208
back at me.
- Walk away.

40:00.583 --> 40:02.250
- Did you just hit me?
- Throwing this sh-- on my hand?

40:02.250 --> 40:03.583
- Did you just hit me?
- You f---ing throw

40:03.583 --> 40:05.250
this sh-- on my hand.
- Did you just hit me?

40:05.292 --> 40:07.375
- You just put this sh-- on my--
you f---ing touch me?

40:07.417 --> 40:09.000
- Chill out, walk away.
- Did you put your f---ing hands

40:09.042 --> 40:10.500
on me, bitch?
- You threw cake at me.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.250
- Dude, stop. F---.
- Okay, okay, okay.

40:12.250 --> 40:13.375
- Did you put your hands on me?
- Okay,

40:13.417 --> 40:14.667
we're not getting physical.

40:14.708 --> 40:15.750
- Take a swim, bye.

40:15.750 --> 40:16.917
- Let's go over here.
- Girl, bye.

40:16.958 --> 40:19.750
- I got cake on my shoes.
- Mike.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.000
- I got cake on my shoes.
- Do not get involved,

40:22.042 --> 40:24.333
that's not your place.
- Asifa, look at me.

40:24.375 --> 40:26.208
- I didn't see anything.
- You're above...

40:26.250 --> 40:27.958
You're above this crap, stop.
Let's go.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.125
You put your hands on me?

40:30.167 --> 40:33.083
- Ooh, ooh.

40:33.125 --> 40:36.208
- Asifa loves to embellish

40:36.250 --> 40:37.958
but what else is true,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.042
is that gg needs some help.

40:40.083 --> 40:43.083
What are you
so angry about, bitch?

40:43.125 --> 40:44.292
- You think
you're gonna touch me

40:44.292 --> 40:45.792
and get away with it?

40:45.792 --> 40:48.250
Ooh.

40:48.292 --> 40:57.750
F---ing ratchet ass bitch.

40:57.792 --> 40:59.125
- Merce? Merce!
- Did you just hit me?

40:59.125 --> 41:01.125
- Dude, stop. F---.
- Okay, okay, okay.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.458
- Did you just put
your hands on me?

41:02.458 --> 41:04.375
Bitch, get the f--- outta here,
swim home.

41:04.417 --> 41:05.750
Take a swim, bye.

41:05.792 --> 41:07.333
- Let's go over here.
- Girl, bye,

41:07.333 --> 41:08.750
you think you're gonna touch me

41:08.792 --> 41:10.167
and get away with it?

41:10.167 --> 41:12.625
Ooh.

41:12.667 --> 41:14.625
F---ing ratchet ass bitch.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.875
I'm gonna put this on you.

41:19.292 --> 41:21.833
Please give me a f---ing drink

41:21.833 --> 41:22.833
no, I'm gonna stand...
- Gg.

41:22.875 --> 41:24.083
- ...right here a new drink,

41:24.125 --> 41:25.292
get me a drink
- what kind do you drink?

41:25.333 --> 41:26.583
- I just want a vodka.

41:26.625 --> 41:27.792
Just give me a drink
and then I'm fine.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.458
- Vodka, okay.
Come sit--will you sit with me

41:29.500 --> 41:30.750
outside, please?
- No, no, no.

41:30.792 --> 41:31.833
- Please.
- Nope, not until I get a drink.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.500
- Hey.
- You'll get your drink now.

41:33.500 --> 41:34.833
Will you please sit
with me outside, please?

41:34.833 --> 41:36.083
- Come on, come with me.

41:36.125 --> 41:38.167
- Please,

41:38.167 --> 41:39.500
let's just wait outside
- ...Let's go downstairs.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.000
- This is too much.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.833
There's something
going on with gg

41:42.833 --> 41:44.167
and it's not good.

41:44.208 --> 41:45.667
- Tito's.
- Soda?

41:45.667 --> 41:47.833
- Rocks, lot of lime, please.

41:47.875 --> 41:49.625
- We can carry her out.
- I don't know

41:49.667 --> 41:51.708
if she's at rock bottom yet.

41:51.708 --> 41:53.208
- I'm hungry.

41:53.208 --> 41:55.792
- But she's definitely
digging around

41:55.833 --> 41:57.208
at the bottom of the barrel.

41:57.208 --> 41:59.500
- don't pet me.

41:59.542 --> 42:01.708
I'm not your f---ing dog.

42:01.708 --> 42:04.208
- I'm really,
really concerned for Golnesa.

42:04.208 --> 42:05.208
- Bye bye.

42:05.250 --> 42:07.458
- Because she's been drinking
too much

42:07.500 --> 42:09.542
and now all this mess
is going on.

42:09.542 --> 42:11.042
I'm worried.
- Sh--.

42:11.083 --> 42:12.708
I got it
on my f---ing foot now, too.

42:12.708 --> 42:14.167
- Michael.

42:16.875 --> 42:19.208
- We are done
with this yacht party.

42:19.250 --> 42:21.375
Like, take the needle,
scratch it,

42:21.375 --> 42:23.375
pull the plug out of the wall,

42:23.375 --> 42:24.708
like, turn off the lights,

42:24.750 --> 42:26.125
the party's over.

42:27.708 --> 42:30.375
- Next on Shahs of Sunset.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.875
- How you doing?
- Thanks for your bed.

42:32.917 --> 42:35.083
- You were pretty lit.

42:35.125 --> 42:36.583
- Your daughter looks fantastic.

42:36.583 --> 42:38.250
I'm fine with how she looks.

42:38.250 --> 42:39.500
- I'm not fine

42:39.542 --> 42:41.250
and it's not about you, Tommy.

42:41.292 --> 42:42.750
That--what are you?

42:42.792 --> 42:45.083
- You and I are horrible
with money.

42:45.125 --> 42:46.750
I don't think that
we should have a baby

42:46.792 --> 42:49.708
until we're financially set.

42:49.750 --> 42:52.583
- I mentioned to Asa
that I would love for her

42:52.625 --> 42:56.083
to officiate at my wedding.

42:56.125 --> 42:57.417
- No.

42:57.417 --> 42:59.375
I want your voice to be strong,

42:59.417 --> 43:01.083
I don't want you
to be dominated.

43:01.083 --> 43:02.583
- How do you feel
about marriage?

43:02.625 --> 43:03.833
- Well,
you kind of took something

43:03.875 --> 43:05.875
that was really important
and special to me

43:05.917 --> 43:07.833
and made it not so special.

43:07.875 --> 43:09.833
- So you don't wanna
get married?

43:09.875 --> 43:11.750
- I don't know.

43:11.792 --> 43:13.458
- What did I miss?

43:13.500 --> 43:14.750
