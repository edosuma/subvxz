01:23.413 --> 01:27.131
Well, what sex is that carrot?

01:27.777 --> 01:30.619
We'll be on...

03:01.677 --> 03:04.124
Hey Cheyenne.

04:11.720 --> 04:16.274
Isn't it kinda dangerous to invest
in stockmarket with all these crises?

04:16.469 --> 04:19.214
Danger is my middle name.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.341
Why do we always come here?

04:22.653 --> 04:25.167
- The coffee is shit.
- It's about the atmosphere.

04:25.168 --> 04:28.177
- You know where they make good coffee?
- In Naples,

04:28.178 --> 04:32.482
you drank coffee there on May 31, 1984,
during the "Cheyenne Bad Friends" tour.

04:32.696 --> 04:34.565
Bad Friends with Cheyenne.

04:34.666 --> 04:37.161
If this crisis drags on,

04:37.394 --> 04:40.419
you can write my official biography.

04:41.104 --> 04:43.285
I would like to write when you went swimming

04:43.286 --> 04:45.892
and possibly a person will
stole your clothes and shoes.

04:46.145 --> 04:48.564
Naples is a violent place.

04:48.661 --> 04:52.239
Violence is everywhere. Only
that it doesn't always show.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.640
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:56.471 --> 04:58.790
- I am Cheyenne.
- I know.

04:59.074 --> 05:01.475
I near at hand would be Desmond.

05:02.715 --> 05:06.507
- This would be Desmond.
- Mary.

05:10.192 --> 05:13.195
Excuse me for being too
direct, Mary, but I'm...

05:14.571 --> 05:19.075
I was wondering if it's okay
with your father here and...

05:19.572 --> 05:22.847
- maybe we could go out sometime.
- He's not my father.

05:22.848 --> 05:28.316
I think that the idea of the two of you...

05:29.058 --> 05:33.712
going out together is...
nice, alright?

05:33.713 --> 05:36.715
What sort of music do you listen to?

05:44.563 --> 05:47.016
Mariah Carey.

05:48.238 --> 05:49.837
Thank you for your invitation Desmond,

05:49.838 --> 05:54.037
but I'm afraid I'm busy
for the next 14 years.

06:02.567 --> 06:05.242
Something's wrong here?

06:05.398 --> 06:09.637
I don't know exactly what it is.

06:10.029 --> 06:12.793
There's something.

07:22.177 --> 07:24.829
Hey Chey?

07:25.185 --> 07:27.921
Hey, how are you doing?

07:28.449 --> 07:30.948
Tesco's shot up.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.249
If I sell now, we'll make 30,000 euros.

07:35.847 --> 07:39.635
You know, I don't think this stock
exchange is doing you much good.

07:39.636 --> 07:41.138
Really?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.921
- What's for supper?
- Pizza.

07:48.041 --> 07:51.504
- Vinci pizza.
- You're full of surprises.

07:52.031 --> 07:54.970
This is one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

07:59.025 --> 08:01.755
What're we gonna do with
the pizza if you lose?

08:01.756 --> 08:03.625
I never lose.

08:05.290 --> 08:09.279
- Is that so?
- Sometimes I let you win.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.283
Really?
And why would you do that?

08:15.518 --> 08:18.867
To you to feel like a stallion.

09:01.975 --> 09:05.678
Game to me,
21-12.

09:06.936 --> 09:09.967
Because of my fuckin' sciatica.

09:09.968 --> 09:14.360
Oh that's right. I've told
you sometimes let you win.

09:15.941 --> 09:18.878
Did you really mean that?

09:33.236 --> 09:37.646
- Any news of Tony?
- No nothing.

09:39.568 --> 09:42.720
Have you opened that letter from MTV?

09:44.693 --> 09:48.168
Can you pass the cream to me?

09:51.450 --> 09:57.260
- Aren't you even curious to know that stuff?
- Only a bit, why?

09:59.459 --> 10:04.610
Oh my God, look, when you see these people
you've got to tell me. This is really gross.

10:08.789 --> 10:12.418
MTV has worldwide coverage, you
know that? It's broadcast live.

10:13.255 --> 10:16.772
And this year as a very special guest,

10:16.773 --> 10:22.129
after 20 years out of the spotlight they
would like to have Cheyenne and the Fellows.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.784
Where is Lady Gaga?

10:29.086 --> 10:32.124
Don't you even think about it?

10:32.232 --> 10:36.464
I already did think about it 20 years ago.

10:37.017 --> 10:39.365
I'm still busy.

10:39.687 --> 10:42.366
I'm gonna to wait for you in bed.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.506
Naked.

11:03.436 --> 11:05.391
- Who are you?
- The future.

11:05.776 --> 11:11.501
- Can I speak with your husband?
- Yeah, sure, right over there.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.906
Howdy, I'm Steven,
we saw each other at the mall.

11:36.317 --> 11:38.572
I was singin' a Bonnie "Prince" Billy,
did you remember?

11:39.269 --> 11:42.706
- Uh... I don't remember.
- No, of course you don't,

11:42.707 --> 11:44.937
because of it's shitty cover.

11:45.337 --> 11:48.597
Oh, shitty cover.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.422
I bought a live demo we
do with me and my group.

11:52.423 --> 11:54.601
I want you to produce our first album.

11:54.775 --> 11:58.022
- I'm not a producer.
- You should be.

11:59.166 --> 12:02.068
- Well you're rather determined, aren't you?
- Rather.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.739
What made you think of me?

12:03.740 --> 12:07.482
What? You used to let the rhythm guitar to
dominate over the master band and lead guitar.

12:07.738 --> 12:10.769
Nobody did that
and I completely agree with that approach,

12:10.770 --> 12:12.752
I have even heard that the Virgens do too.

12:12.753 --> 12:17.867
Yeah, we had that problem
so we had to get rid of the guitars.

12:17.868 --> 12:21.113
I can't get rid of the guitars, man,
he's my brother.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.896
Listen, if you produce it you
could have you say about everything.

12:23.897 --> 12:26.099
Except the name of the group
that is not negotiable.

12:26.595 --> 12:28.526
What do you call yourselves?

12:29.010 --> 12:31.396
"The Pieces of Shit".

12:37.001 --> 12:40.474
- This is a really good choice.
- Fuckin' right it is, yeah.

12:40.475 --> 12:42.591
It took us six months to come up with that.

12:43.093 --> 12:49.015
Besides, it's exactly the right name
for this moment in history.

12:50.587 --> 12:52.702
I'll see you.

13:12.968 --> 13:16.672
I don't have this one, fuck a bootleg copy.

13:17.310 --> 13:22.202
Fuck! Desmond,
where did you come across this relic?

13:22.535 --> 13:25.779
I uh...

13:26.422 --> 13:28.250
- When I...
- You gave it to him.

13:28.751 --> 13:33.308
- What the fuck does that mean?
- You two arrange the whole thing.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.007
- Fuckin' moroons.
- You're fuckin' paranoid.

13:37.008 --> 13:39.413
I'm sorry, Mary.

13:40.524 --> 13:46.131
I invited Desmond for supper on
Friday and you have to come too.

13:46.132 --> 13:49.191
Forget it.
Not in your life.

13:50.048 --> 13:53.403
Morgan Labs, buy 70, hold 30%.

13:53.404 --> 13:56.779
- That bitch Melany dumped me.
- How long were you together?

13:56.780 --> 13:59.064
- Four days.
- Are you suffering?

13:59.065 --> 14:02.848
Like the last panda standing.
That woman extinguished me.

14:03.410 --> 14:08.813
Keep an eye on the Tesco shares. They're
like a group of teenage girls.?????

14:08.814 --> 14:11.799
Listen, I want to tell you about
the girl I dumped Wednesday.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.255
One leg in a cast, made it one of
the most satisfying moments ever.

14:15.347 --> 14:18.249
No, no. I don't think
that would interest me.

14:18.250 --> 14:21.640
Excuse me. Karen, God bless,
thanks for calling me back.

14:22.064 --> 14:24.160
Yeah, yeah. I feel so lonely.

14:24.161 --> 14:29.321
- How is your life, grandma?
- Great,

14:29.496 --> 14:31.998
except for my husband.

14:32.396 --> 14:34.758
Take a lover.

14:34.759 --> 14:39.585
I have that already, like everything else.

14:39.889 --> 14:42.707
And yours?

14:42.857 --> 14:47.523
My life? Now I feel just...

14:48.293 --> 14:50.712
high.

15:21.214 --> 15:26.436
How many times must we tell you
you are not welcome at our sons' graves.

15:57.827 --> 15:59.877
Eh Friday...

16:00.348 --> 16:02.954
That dinner you mentioned.

16:03.948 --> 16:06.088
I'll be there.

16:40.895 --> 16:44.297
Did you do the bike?
The bike...

17:46.152 --> 17:49.067
I was just asking myself

17:49.530 --> 17:54.884
why with all the vices I've been taught
in my life I never took up smoking.

17:54.885 --> 17:57.359
Where is my son?

17:58.130 --> 18:00.968
That's what you should be asking yourself.

18:02.144 --> 18:04.576
Everything else is bullshit.

18:05.066 --> 18:11.983
- Unfortunately I don't know where he is.
- Go find him then. All of you.

18:14.725 --> 18:19.696
Three months is an eternity.
Why?

18:20.596 --> 18:23.103
If everything is just fine,

18:24.313 --> 18:26.866
why would someone just leave...

18:27.713 --> 18:30.341
without saying a word?

18:31.171 --> 18:33.995
Without sending news.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.784
Why?

18:46.623 --> 18:51.863
You never took up smoking...
because you remained a child.

18:53.452 --> 18:57.732
Children are the only ones that
never get the urge to smoke.

18:59.583 --> 19:02.961
Tony never smoked either.

19:42.839 --> 19:45.766
Okay, I know you're wondering
what's the position you have to use

19:45.767 --> 19:48.693
to shack someone whose leg
is in a cast up to the crotch.

19:48.694 --> 19:51.285
I wasn't wondering that...

19:51.286 --> 19:53.459
You have to use different things,
you know, experiment.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.477
How do you manage to get all these women?

19:56.811 --> 19:59.055
If you think about it,

19:59.320 --> 20:01.457
You are not handsome,

20:01.807 --> 20:03.886
you are not smart.

20:04.531 --> 20:07.629
Instead you're evasive,

20:07.630 --> 20:10.278
and egocentric,

20:10.689 --> 20:13.842
and you sweat like a pig.

20:13.992 --> 20:17.648
- So what makes you so fuckin' special?
- Special? No, no.

20:18.168 --> 20:21.642
Nothing. But I've got two things
that most other men don't have.

20:21.643 --> 20:25.063
I've got curiosity... and time,
you see? So I...

20:25.064 --> 20:29.168
I dedicate a whole lot of time to women, you
know, and in the end that will seduce them.

20:29.169 --> 20:31.026
I am beside them all the time.

20:31.027 --> 20:34.511
Through the six months you
have the every fuckin' day.

20:34.512 --> 20:37.853
Do you understand? And they don't cave in
because they're so exhausted, huh,

20:37.854 --> 20:42.257
they cave in because they didn't believe
they were worth all that fun, do you get it?

20:42.394 --> 20:46.350
Pretty much.
And the curiosity part?

20:46.351 --> 20:49.495
The curiosity is the fire that keeps
you going for six months straight.

20:49.496 --> 20:52.552
You know what my lame leg
looked just before I came?

20:52.553 --> 20:56.354
She was panting. She exploded at my cast.
She said "I want you to sign it for me."

20:56.876 --> 21:00.584
Moments like that make you
feel you're a better man, you know.

21:01.009 --> 21:05.449
What the fuck are you doing. You're
like making me talk to myself, dude?

21:50.165 --> 21:55.919
Have I ever told you about the time
that Jane fell asleep watching TV,

21:55.920 --> 21:58.157
while smoking a joint?

21:58.509 --> 22:04.255
And the pillow on the couch caught
on fire, but I realized that in time

22:04.256 --> 22:07.821
and managed to put it out?

22:13.061 --> 22:19.867
I've forgotten to tell you a crucial detail,
Desmond, that's why you're not laughing.

22:20.893 --> 22:25.618
Jane is a firefighter by profession.

22:26.144 --> 22:29.697
- So, Desmond, you live alone or not?
- Me? No.

22:29.980 --> 22:32.133
I live with my family, Unfortunately.

22:32.134 --> 22:35.351
- I have six brothers.
- Fuck! Six brothers.

22:35.599 --> 22:40.170
Yeah. Six lazy slags that
don't do a damn thing all day.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.594
It would be good if they all vanish
from the face of the earth for a while.

22:46.770 --> 22:50.557
Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.

22:52.505 --> 22:55.128
Nice move, Desmond.

22:55.555 --> 22:56.923
What did I say wrong?

22:57.224 --> 23:00.091
Nothing, women are always running
out to the bathroom, you know.

23:00.092 --> 23:01.912
When you're young, you
think it's for cocaine,

23:01.913 --> 23:04.232
but as years go by you learn
that there are many reasons,

23:04.233 --> 23:06.952
well, like food stalling their teeth,
or period.

23:06.953 --> 23:12.940
Yeah, take notes Desmond. Jeffery
clearly knows all about us women.

23:17.020 --> 23:23.185
Cheyenne, the roast beef looks lovely.
Too bad Michelle and I don't eat meat.

23:24.001 --> 23:26.820
Michelle is her doggie.

23:28.820 --> 23:33.153
Fuck.

23:52.682 --> 23:55.817
How deep is it? How
is the deepest point?

23:56.042 --> 23:58.563
Seven feet.

23:58.745 --> 24:01.996
What's wrong with your dog?

24:02.233 --> 24:06.250
I don't know. Jane looks after him.

24:06.562 --> 24:10.119
- You don't work, Cheyenne?
- I don't have to.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.618
Everyone needs work.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.034
- Do you have any kids?
- No.

24:15.331 --> 24:18.263
- Why not?
- Rock stars shouldn't have kids,

24:18.264 --> 24:22.182
as you run the risk that your
daughter becomes a wrecky stylist.

24:22.183 --> 24:25.108
Why isn't there any water in your pool?

24:27.814 --> 24:30.105
I don't know.

24:32.299 --> 24:34.507
No one ever filled it.

24:34.508 --> 24:39.311
- What about you doing it?
- Well, as a matter of fact...

24:39.560 --> 24:43.158
Jane and I play bare hand Pelota in it.

24:43.570 --> 24:47.463
And Pelota is more fun than swimming.

24:48.038 --> 24:50.419
- So why did you...
- Desmond,

24:50.420 --> 24:55.844
I didn't invite you to get
here to interview me. Sorry.

24:55.845 --> 24:56.845
It's alright.

25:13.741 --> 25:16.976
I have never succeeded with Mary.

25:20.003 --> 25:22.157
I really fancy her.

25:22.158 --> 25:26.982
The secret is time, Desmond.

25:28.366 --> 25:31.490
Spend time with her.

25:32.158 --> 25:35.406
All the time she needs.

25:35.855 --> 25:39.547
Then she'll come around. you'll see.

25:40.968 --> 25:44.269
That's what wins women over,

25:45.884 --> 25:49.627
and makes them feel safe.

25:53.700 --> 25:57.378
Please don't give up on Mary, Desmond.

25:57.719 --> 25:59.969
Promise me.

26:34.393 --> 26:38.512
I think I'm at time depressed.

26:43.277 --> 26:45.261
I think a man who does that

26:45.680 --> 26:51.118
with his wife for 35 years
as if for the first time

26:52.148 --> 26:54.651
is not depressed.

26:55.752 --> 27:00.541
Maybe you are confusing depression
with boredom.

28:13.764 --> 28:17.231
My father is dying of old age.

28:17.575 --> 28:22.253
A non-existent disease
that I haven't flown in 30 years.

28:22.369 --> 28:25.328
- Fear of flying isn't your only problem.
- That is true.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.138
I also have a mild fear of dying.

28:28.139 --> 28:30.923
You can't die until you
sell off the Tesco shares.

28:36.061 --> 28:41.511
- What will you do when I'm away?
- All the usual things.

28:43.892 --> 28:47.573
Take it easy on the Tai Chi.

28:53.302 --> 28:56.805
- Jane, can I ask you something?
- Naturally. What?

28:57.472 --> 29:02.966
Why did you let that architect,
write "cuisine" on the kitchen wall,

29:03.238 --> 29:06.541
It's silly. I know
what the kitchen is.

29:06.542 --> 29:10.244
Come back to me soon. You know
I can't live without your.

29:11.946 --> 29:17.284
That's not true,
but it's kind of you to say.

29:26.844 --> 29:30.864
The problem is that it doesn't last.
Gone in half an hour whatever or not.

29:30.865 --> 29:34.227
- It's true.
- You look so pretty without that.

29:34.228 --> 29:35.937
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

29:35.938 --> 29:38.446
Have you tried the bee pollen.
It usually lasts quite a while.

29:38.447 --> 29:40.597
No, you need more of
hydrating elements like Lancome.

29:40.854 --> 29:43.897
Otherwise it feels like
plaster after an hour.

29:48.366 --> 29:50.909
The brand doesn't matter.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.479
If you want it stay in power,

29:53.480 --> 29:59.185
you have to put a thin layer of face powder
on your lips first. That's the secret.

29:59.589 --> 30:03.390
Then your lipstick will last all day.

31:45.323 --> 31:48.622
- Hi cousin.
- Hi Richard.

31:54.933 --> 31:57.886
You're late, what took you so long?

38:35.799 --> 38:38.336
The next time I'll play the whole city.
I'm just kidding.

38:38.337 --> 38:42.556
David, there's something
I have to tell you.

38:43.485 --> 38:47.922
Even though we haven't seen
each other for all these years,

38:48.386 --> 38:51.465
I still can't believe
you consider me a friend.

38:51.466 --> 38:52.583
Why was that?

38:52.584 --> 38:55.901
Because we haven't the
slightest thing in common.

38:56.344 --> 38:59.773
You have such foresight thoughts,

39:00.338 --> 39:03.283
ideas that you turn into reality,

39:03.284 --> 39:06.377
and you amaze people with your ideas.

39:06.741 --> 39:11.605
And they call you the most extraordinary
thing and artist and they're right.

39:11.915 --> 39:14.572
David Byrne is an artist.

39:14.938 --> 39:19.852
- Will you do that when you're performing?
- The fuck I was, David, the fuck I was.

39:19.853 --> 39:22.243
I was a fucking pop star.

39:22.244 --> 39:25.194
I used to write dreary songs
because they were all the rage

39:25.195 --> 39:26.524
and made tones of money.

39:26.525 --> 39:29.880
Depressed songs for depressed kids,

39:29.881 --> 39:32.634
and two of them, more
fragile than the rest,

39:32.635 --> 39:35.581
ended up doing themselves
in as a result of it.

39:35.582 --> 39:39.616
And now I go to a cemetery once a week
to appease my guilt,

39:39.617 --> 39:42.810
and it doesn't make it better.
It makes it fuckin' worse.

39:42.811 --> 39:45.901
And then my wife asks me
why I don't play anymore,

39:46.024 --> 39:47.929
and I think she must be a fool

39:47.930 --> 39:52.635
because she just loves me very
much, which makes her more of a fool

39:52.636 --> 39:55.878
because she doesn't know what
a disaster her husband is.

39:55.879 --> 40:00.175
And that's it, David, that's it!

40:53.942 --> 40:59.445
Before the inferno,
my life could be summed up in a single word,

41:00.804 --> 41:03.334
lightheartedness.

41:18.641 --> 41:24.419
To ensure a safe passage, we will join...

41:30.599 --> 41:33.001
Who is that?
Do you know who that is?

41:36.887 --> 41:40.836
- Everyone knows him.
- Not me.

41:41.320 --> 41:46.228
- That's Mordecai Midler.
- Who is he?

41:46.832 --> 41:48.964
A legend.

42:09.363 --> 42:11.767
I got it right here,
call me about half an hour.

42:11.768 --> 42:14.265
Wait, we got a deal, right?

42:14.266 --> 42:17.328
The ring's in my pocket.

42:18.413 --> 42:20.186
Enjoy yourself, my friend.

42:20.187 --> 42:23.868
If you wanna look death in the face, you
can't go wrong in a tourist trap like this.

42:24.104 --> 42:28.129
Ernie Ray, financial broker.
Big deals as you've ever needed.

42:28.996 --> 42:32.912
Do I look like someone who makes big deals?

42:34.871 --> 42:37.874
Hey, money can be found in
the most improbable place.

42:37.983 --> 42:44.774
- It's experience talking, my friend.
- That's your big experience talking, Ernie.

42:45.751 --> 42:47.930
You know you're a good guy, you.

42:48.903 --> 42:51.311
Tell me, how fuckin' old are you,
I can't figure out.

42:51.312 --> 42:56.088
I'm as old as I look under
all this face paint and lipstick.

42:58.635 --> 43:01.251
You're a good guy, I knew it.

43:01.479 --> 43:03.398
I know you got some sorta
big problems right now.

43:03.399 --> 43:05.118
But I won't ask now because
I know you wouldn't tell me.

43:05.119 --> 43:07.409
Do you know what my problem is now?

43:07.837 --> 43:11.204
No, but I have the feeling I'm
gonna to be hearing about it.

43:11.205 --> 43:13.527
So if the boss calls me
an hour ago and says Ernie

43:13.717 --> 43:16.637
you have to go to London
tomorrow and stay for a month.

43:16.974 --> 43:19.227
That's all well and
good, except for the fact

43:19.228 --> 43:22.081
that I'm in New York City with my pick-up
and I'm gonna to get back to Texas.

43:22.082 --> 43:24.735
My wife needs me,
not believe me that makes a difference.

43:24.736 --> 43:28.778
The real problem is a garage in
the city costs me a bloody fortune.

43:28.779 --> 43:31.030
That my friend... that's my problem.

43:31.031 --> 43:35.705
If I recall correctly, there are companies
that deal with that sort of thing.

43:35.706 --> 43:39.978
Hey, I'm not giving up my pickup to some
fuckin' company,

43:40.208 --> 43:42.013
I trust not.

43:42.014 --> 43:45.395
- There is no solution.
- You're right.

43:46.674 --> 43:49.312
There's no solution.

43:57.780 --> 43:58.970
Did you read them?

43:58.971 --> 44:02.159
I've read through them. they
didn't talk about me at all.

44:02.160 --> 44:05.737
You have never said a word about
him. You two are exactly the same.

44:05.862 --> 44:11.308
- How about the sketches they did over there?
- I didn't understand.

44:11.309 --> 44:15.175
You do everything that might
be of help in searching for him.

44:16.881 --> 44:21.010
In searching for Richard?

44:22.326 --> 44:28.947
I didn't talk to my father in 30 years.
I don't know the first thing about him.

44:28.948 --> 44:31.689
After you left for Ireland,

44:32.387 --> 44:35.535
all he ever did was
search for Aloise Lange,

44:35.808 --> 44:38.317
his persecutor at Auschwitz

44:38.900 --> 44:41.744
in every corner of the United States.

44:42.313 --> 44:44.713
He never found him,

44:45.322 --> 44:47.675
but he got awfully close.

44:48.152 --> 44:51.288
So close that he found his American wife.

44:53.008 --> 44:55.690
Those drawings are important.

44:55.951 --> 44:59.305
They could lead right to the
hiding place a Nazi Criminal.

44:59.498 --> 45:02.422
- Are not they all dead?
- Not all dead.

45:02.423 --> 45:05.356
Life expectancies are different here.

45:07.028 --> 45:10.996
So what am I supposed
to do with this stuff?

45:12.472 --> 45:17.418
You can take it to Mordecai Midler, who
urged all some 700 Nazi Criminals.

45:17.728 --> 45:22.297
- Why didn't you talk to him in 30 years?
- He didn't love me.

46:13.183 --> 46:17.323
I have some materials that
maybe of service in capturing

46:17.324 --> 46:20.462
a Nazi war criminal named Aloise Lange.

46:20.463 --> 46:24.362
Teeth. I am interested
in teeth, my dear boy.

46:24.530 --> 46:26.199
It was since the Nazis die,

46:26.200 --> 46:29.627
they became too old to be extradited.
I'm looking for the teeth.

46:30.354 --> 46:33.555
What's with the gold teeth
of the Jews happened?

46:33.839 --> 46:36.232
Tons of teeth.

46:36.342 --> 46:38.760
Stashed in a safe somewhere?

46:38.860 --> 46:40.998
Or hanging around the
necks of some crowned dames?

46:40.999 --> 46:44.709
This is what I want to know,
because those teeth are ours.

46:45.779 --> 46:51.834
Something is no quite right here, I'm
not deadly sure, but something...

46:51.835 --> 46:57.378
I know, because this is not an
argument for trendy boys like you.

46:59.441 --> 47:03.620
Your father, he spoke to me about you.

47:06.757 --> 47:12.643
- Are you going to look for Aloise Lange?
- No, I'm looking for the teeth like I've said.

47:12.644 --> 47:16.018
You really take after your father.
You both are rather pedantic.

47:16.019 --> 47:22.962
My instinct tells me that pedantry is an
essential characteristic for capturing Nazis.

47:23.463 --> 47:27.105
True. But solitude is the
playground of resemblance.

47:27.280 --> 47:29.479
Your father was too much a loner.

47:29.555 --> 47:31.484
He's sorta feeding his
resentment toward someone

47:31.485 --> 47:34.014
who are a lot less wicked than many others.

47:34.520 --> 47:37.873
I know who Aloise Lange is.
He is a nobody.

47:38.453 --> 47:43.088
Besides, he's got to be a 95 by now.
The chances are 9 out of 10 he's already dead.

47:43.089 --> 47:49.082
- But did the two of you actually look for him?
- A little, he was a small fish.

47:49.412 --> 47:52.517
- We were hunting sharks.
- Of course.

47:52.668 --> 47:55.816
That makes a bigger impression.

47:57.032 --> 47:59.645
What're you insinuating?

47:59.976 --> 48:03.301
That you the Nazi Hunters
follow the rules of show business

48:03.302 --> 48:06.405
and go after the biggest publicity.

48:06.770 --> 48:10.056
I don't let anyone play me for
a fool looking for publicity.

48:10.057 --> 48:13.613
- We all play the fool sometimes.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

48:13.731 --> 48:16.055
Oh, dressed up like that.

48:16.244 --> 48:20.495
Now listen up boy, I sacrifice my own
life in order to find those bastards.

48:20.496 --> 48:23.322
That's not exactly what
I call show business.

48:23.648 --> 48:26.702
A lot of Jews who survived,
they got over it, but not me.

48:26.754 --> 48:30.234
I am 79 years old,
but I'm still living in 1940.

48:31.144 --> 48:33.723
Just like your father.

48:34.616 --> 48:37.375
- Are you a practicing Jew?
- No.

48:37.376 --> 48:41.165
- You know about the Holocaust?
- In a general sort of way.

48:41.166 --> 48:43.322
And your father?
Did you know your father?

48:43.623 --> 48:45.878
In a general sort of way.

48:45.879 --> 48:49.674
Where the fuck have you
been living all this time?

49:57.640 --> 49:59.867
How're you with dogs?

50:00.268 --> 50:05.083
I have a dog, my wife looks after him.

50:05.265 --> 50:09.133
I take care of mine.
Name is Who.

50:09.364 --> 50:13.317
The fucker's full of rage inside,
but he won't show it... like you.

50:14.910 --> 50:17.936
Can I have your mobile number?

50:18.424 --> 50:21.801
I've never had a cell phone.

50:38.004 --> 50:43.217
Before the inferno, my life could
be summed up in a single word...

50:43.460 --> 50:45.922
lightheartedness.

50:45.923 --> 50:49.586
As a child I like to stare at the Polish sky,

50:49.587 --> 50:53.755
the same sky that later
I saw from the camp,

50:53.756 --> 50:58.900
stained with black stripes,
the smoke of my relatives.

50:58.901 --> 51:01.637
Yet that macabre vision

51:01.638 --> 51:06.378
did not prevent me from
enjoying the beauty of the sky.

51:06.379 --> 51:09.023
Another monstrous thought,

51:09.024 --> 51:13.391
like all the thoughts
people in the inferno had.

51:13.818 --> 51:18.290
Ladies and gentlemen, "The Pieces of Shit".

53:02.752 --> 53:05.428
Do you have a free room?

53:05.686 --> 53:08.831
They are all free.

53:36.361 --> 53:41.045
Hi Jane, how are you?

53:44.597 --> 53:47.798
Any news of Tony?

53:50.163 --> 53:55.062
No, I'm not in the least bit tired.

53:56.107 --> 54:00.005
I'll board the ship in half an hour.

54:00.896 --> 54:06.355
Who knows, you can't tell how
rough it's gonna be from the port.

54:06.950 --> 54:11.712
Richard's fine. he is growing
into a very handsome man,

54:11.713 --> 54:15.609
except that he has false teeth.

54:18.429 --> 54:21.148
Why are you laughing?

54:23.634 --> 54:29.220
Oh shit, they are so perfect that
you can't believe they are real.

54:31.807 --> 54:37.334
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm just jealous.

54:41.079 --> 54:46.853
In a week from now, I'll be home.

55:33.384 --> 55:36.898
Are you used to drink a lot?

55:38.187 --> 55:41.241
You have to decide to stop.

55:41.836 --> 55:44.551
Do you like tattoos?

55:45.197 --> 55:50.311
I was just asking myself about that
when I was looking at you. I don't know.

55:50.487 --> 55:53.538
I never made up my mind yet.

55:57.041 --> 56:00.088
I make tattoos for a living.

56:00.571 --> 56:03.617
- That must be a good job.
- Not a job.

56:04.470 --> 56:06.286
It's an art.

56:06.533 --> 56:11.588
Have you noticed how
nobody works anymore...

56:11.589 --> 56:15.357
and everybody does something artistic?

56:15.726 --> 56:18.169
And what are you doing?

56:19.204 --> 56:21.988
At this particular moment?

56:21.989 --> 56:25.572
I'm tryin' to fix up a sad boy...

56:26.118 --> 56:28.332
and a sad girl,

56:29.099 --> 56:32.875
and it's not easy.
I suspect...

56:33.350 --> 56:37.713
that sadness is not
compatible with sadness.

56:39.892 --> 56:45.398
I fixed up my aunt. She is
handicapped with a friend of mine.

56:45.657 --> 56:48.827
A barber, good barber.

56:49.957 --> 56:52.383
It's a beautiful thing.

56:52.384 --> 56:55.409
They keep each other company...

56:56.591 --> 56:59.147
and they are grateful to me.

56:59.929 --> 57:04.961
Another beautiful thing...
gratitude.

57:08.065 --> 57:11.920
Life is full of beautiful things.

57:14.214 --> 57:19.900
True, but gratitude is the
most beautiful thing of all.

57:20.419 --> 57:23.165
And what are you doing here
in this godforsaken place.

57:23.166 --> 57:26.460
I am looking for a Nazi
criminal from Auschwitz.

57:27.061 --> 57:28.554
Really?

57:30.250 --> 57:31.793
Aren't they all dead?

57:31.794 --> 57:35.737
That's what I thought too,
but apparently they're not.

57:36.848 --> 57:40.358
And what're you gonna do when you find him?

59:15.242 --> 59:18.948
- Would you like to kill me, dear?
- No ma'am.

59:19.343 --> 59:22.007
Why would I want to do that?

59:22.500 --> 59:26.081
I'm John Smith, a former student of yours.

59:26.082 --> 59:27.980
And I was in the area,

59:28.331 --> 59:32.678
and I thought I would stop by to say hello.

59:36.344 --> 59:41.124
No, I don't recall that name. That's
odd because I remember all my students.

59:41.722 --> 59:44.623
Oh of course, in high school

59:44.624 --> 59:48.216
I didn't dress like this
and I wore no makeup.

59:48.585 --> 59:52.388
And why do you do it now
that you are grown, John?

59:52.389 --> 59:56.514
I don't like this one bit.
You have to promise me...

59:56.814 --> 01:00:00.223
that you address this problem of yours.

01:00:00.224 --> 01:00:02.490
- I promise.
- That's not the point.

01:00:02.491 --> 01:00:05.984
The point is...
your name doesn't ring a bell.

01:00:05.985 --> 01:00:10.023
Maybe because it's such a common name.

01:00:23.074 --> 01:00:29.387
- Jackie, you like my student?
- Of course not.

01:00:30.181 --> 01:00:34.425
Jackie has a terrible temper.

01:00:37.317 --> 01:00:41.959
- I really enjoyed your history lessons, ma'am.
- Thank you, dear.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:47.206
I still remembered one
that was very memorable.

01:00:48.154 --> 01:00:54.060
- About the Holocaust.
- The Holocaust?

01:00:54.061 --> 01:00:58.204
Oh, that's odd. We never used to get
to that till the end of the school term.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.025
And then we would just
rushed right through it.

01:01:01.332 --> 01:01:05.119
- Sometimes I would skip it altogether.
- Not in my year.

01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:11.602
I remember it. It was very touching.

01:01:13.733 --> 01:01:16.535
Naturally... It... it...

01:01:17.197 --> 01:01:21.971
It was a tragedy.
Children.

01:01:22.975 --> 01:01:28.770
No one should ever touch a children.

01:01:30.768 --> 01:01:37.145
Why did the Germans decide
to exterminate the Jews?

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:45.874
That... oh... dear, that's one of those
million-dollar questions, I'm afraid.

01:01:46.706 --> 01:01:50.471
But so many books have been written
about it, and you're a historian,

01:01:50.472 --> 01:01:53.472
so you must have thought about it.

01:01:57.433 --> 01:02:00.579
They wanted their money.

01:02:03.426 --> 01:02:06.272
Their money?

01:02:09.078 --> 01:02:15.175
- But not all the Jews were rich.
- They all had something.

01:02:22.135 --> 01:02:25.206
- This tea is delicious.
- No, it is not,

01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:27.068
I can't make good tea.

01:02:27.154 --> 01:02:33.848
I try to develop a habit...
but I have never had a life of habits.

01:02:34.253 --> 01:02:36.763
How is your husband?

01:02:36.764 --> 01:02:42.285
My husband is dead unfortunately.
He's been dead for 10 years.

01:02:42.286 --> 01:02:45.509
I'm sorry. And your children?

01:02:48.496 --> 01:02:51.038
Nathan lives in Asia.

01:02:51.429 --> 01:02:53.532
- I never see him.
- That's a shame.

01:02:53.533 --> 01:02:58.295
No, Nathan was a complicated soul.

01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:04.718
We do get to see my granddaughter Rachel.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.846
I get to see Rachel...

01:03:09.433 --> 01:03:12.311
every once and a while.

01:03:16.769 --> 01:03:20.680
Emily, be a good girl!

01:03:21.978 --> 01:03:27.673
There have been real pleasure,
but I must be going now.

01:03:35.486 --> 01:03:38.956
I simply don't remember that name.

01:03:41.934 --> 01:03:47.804
You'll come to it, sooner or later.

01:05:31.867 --> 01:05:35.444
Goodnight Emily.

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:42.453
Do you need a ride?

01:09:52.116 --> 01:09:55.581
No shit. Now I remember you.

01:09:55.923 --> 01:09:58.195
You sang with Mick Jagger once.

01:09:58.196 --> 01:10:02.037
I know him. He's a good singer.
I like the way he dances.

01:10:02.038 --> 01:10:05.607
I think your cheeseburger
is a bit too well done.

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:11.945
You don't mind, do ya?
Unfortunately, it's life.

01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:16.681
You know what the problem is, Rachel?

01:10:17.382 --> 01:10:18.182
What?

01:10:18.249 --> 01:10:22.614
Without realizing it, we go
from an age where we say

01:10:23.037 --> 01:10:27.693
"My life will be that too"
to an age where we say

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:30.795
"That' life."

01:10:52.902 --> 01:10:56.685
Hey man, I'm sorry,
I didn't do it on purpose.

01:10:59.913 --> 01:11:03.590
I'm sorry, really.
We will be more careful.

01:11:03.756 --> 01:11:05.885
It's not a question of being careful.

01:11:05.886 --> 01:11:09.414
It's a question of knowing
how to play ping-pong.

01:11:15.294 --> 01:11:21.183
You serve. It's your point. You
win the next one the game is yours.

01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:29.802
It's your serve.

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:36.340
Or we can wrap this up tomorrow
if you want. It's up to you now.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:43.221
That's not fair.
I was distracted.

01:11:44.363 --> 01:11:49.086
This is a common problem with
all the youth... distraction.

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:53.432
Don't forget to leave a tip.

01:12:12.412 --> 01:12:15.143
No, I'm not that kind of girl.

01:12:15.556 --> 01:12:18.925
I'm not that kind of boy.

01:12:26.824 --> 01:12:29.696
He's afraid of the water.

01:12:31.756 --> 01:12:37.083
But he is a brave boy.
He gets over all my crisis.

01:12:38.835 --> 01:12:41.761
What did you do when you're in my age?

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:45.560
Other than playing music?

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:50.925
Sniffing heroin.

01:12:52.742 --> 01:12:56.986
- You didn't shoot that?
- I'm afraid of needles.

01:12:57.859 --> 01:13:03.601
- Fear saves us every time.
- Every time.

01:13:13.161 --> 01:13:19.127
But you have to choose
a moment in your life,

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:23.747
even one,

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:27.716
to not be afraid.

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.711
- And have you chosen that moment?
- Yeah.

01:13:34.049 --> 01:13:36.080
This time.

01:13:48.297 --> 01:13:53.298
I can't explain why I didn't
talk to my father for 30 years.

01:13:54.684 --> 01:14:00.886
I must have thought that
there was a mutual contempt.

01:14:02.391 --> 01:14:08.089
When I was 15 I decided,
that he didn't love me,

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:14.178
because I made up my
eyes exactly as I do now.

01:14:14.753 --> 01:14:17.375
When you're a kid,

01:14:17.795 --> 01:14:22.070
it's very hard to back
off from your decisions.

01:14:25.796 --> 01:14:29.757
But I pretended to be a kid for too long.

01:14:30.378 --> 01:14:33.851
And only now that I realize...

01:14:34.873 --> 01:14:37.820
that a father can help...

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:42.987
and love his child.

01:14:45.605 --> 01:14:48.331
That I have no kids...

01:14:48.837 --> 01:14:52.909
makes me really, really sick

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:58.972
And now that I realize it, it's too late.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.744
- It's better late than never.
- That's not true,

01:15:04.745 --> 01:15:08.455
late is late.

01:15:29.576 --> 01:15:32.724
There is an air force base nearby.

01:15:32.965 --> 01:15:36.546
A lot of military live here.

01:15:39.365 --> 01:15:43.839
We also have the biggest
pistachio in the world here.

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:47.115
It's a sculpture.

01:15:48.091 --> 01:15:51.668
It's even in the Guinness Book of Records.

01:15:56.767 --> 01:16:00.220
And the littlest one, where is that?

01:16:18.647 --> 01:16:21.265
I know how to sing.

01:16:21.665 --> 01:16:24.383
I have no doubt.

01:16:25.024 --> 01:16:27.873
I don't know how to play.

01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:30.481
That's not true, my mom
says you're a singer.

01:16:30.482 --> 01:16:33.375
He even sang with Mick Jagger.

01:16:33.696 --> 01:16:39.151
Actually Mick Jagger sang with me.
It's his idea.

01:16:39.152 --> 01:16:43.586
Well, rock history review
right here in our house, Tommy.

01:16:43.587 --> 01:16:46.145
Can you play something, please?
Just one song.

01:16:46.146 --> 01:16:50.405
I don't play anymore and besides
I don't know if I remember how.

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:53.116
My music teacher said once
you learn you never forget.

01:16:53.117 --> 01:16:58.169
Maybe he was just trying to be nice
so he can earn some money out of you.

01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:02.326
Please, just one.

01:17:11.547 --> 01:17:12.747
Fuck!

01:17:13.948 --> 01:17:18.188
- What do you want me to play?
- "This Must Be The Place" by Arcade Fire.

01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:21.471
Nonsense, "This Must Be The Place"
is by the Talking Heads.

01:17:21.472 --> 01:17:25.057
- No, it's by Arcade Fire.
- Trust me, you're delusional.

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:28.193
"This Must Be The Place"
is by the Talking Heads.

01:17:28.194 --> 01:17:31.328
Arcade Fire merely did the cover.

01:17:33.981 --> 01:17:34.875
This is "Where I...

01:17:34.876 --> 01:17:37.769
"...I'm going". I was just
seeing if the guitar wasn't tuned.

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:39.572
Oh, sorry.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.501
Thank you, it was a
pleasure performing with you.

01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:44.473
What's your relationship with your father?

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:47.124
It's good,

01:18:47.315 --> 01:18:51.892
even though I never see him.
He lives in Hong Kong.

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:54.979
He never comes back to America.

01:18:55.697 --> 01:19:00.151
But... there are some dark side
in my family too.

01:19:01.416 --> 01:19:05.864
- Oh yeah.
- Like everyone's, I guess.

01:19:06.556 --> 01:19:09.322
My father, for example,

01:19:09.323 --> 01:19:13.719
he broke off all relations
with his parents years ago.

01:19:14.002 --> 01:19:16.608
And I never knew why.

01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:21.609
I asked him a thousand times
and he'd never really say.

01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:28.629
Did you ever ask your
grandparents about it?

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:31.549
They're just as evasive.

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:36.259
Once, when I was twelve,

01:19:36.864 --> 01:19:41.310
my grandfather told me
something I've never forgotten.

01:19:42.962 --> 01:19:49.824
He said, "Whatever happens, remember
I'll always be part of your life."

01:19:54.152 --> 01:19:57.940
And he had tears in his
eyes when he said that.

01:20:01.734 --> 01:20:06.328
- Do you ever see him?
- No, almost never.

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:12.468
He lives far away...
in a little town in Utah.

01:20:12.469 --> 01:20:15.443
In Huntsville.

01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:36.583
I can't make love with you, Rachel.

01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:40.307
I'm married.

01:21:25.018 --> 01:21:30.873
Before the inferno, there was home.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:38.553
That first furtive kiss
in the backyard at age 13.

01:21:39.105 --> 01:21:42.889
The smell and stain of home.

01:21:43.134 --> 01:21:45.867
The black clouds.

01:21:46.728 --> 01:21:49.678
The flu of approaching thunder.

01:21:49.879 --> 01:21:53.787
The child refuge in the
corner near the window.

01:21:55.213 --> 01:21:59.017
The blanket over me when
I was sick with fever.

01:21:59.888 --> 01:22:02.718
Blissful boredom.

01:22:03.176 --> 01:22:06.149
And shivers of joy.

01:22:07.072 --> 01:22:11.923
- Mum!
- It was, in short, a mental intimacy.

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:16.309
We can't predicate the
loss of mental intimacy,

01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:19.731
thus establishing a new kind of death,

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:22.609
a breathing death.

01:22:29.775 --> 01:22:33.456
There are many ways to dying,
the worst of that...

01:22:33.808 --> 01:22:36.815
is to continue living.

01:22:50.233 --> 01:22:53.923
- Anything from Tony?
- No.

01:22:54.585 --> 01:22:56.326
What are you doing? Are you...

01:22:56.327 --> 01:22:59.266
Aren't you trying to find
yourself or something?

01:22:59.267 --> 01:23:00.844
No Jane...

01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:07.021
I'm not trying to find myself.
I'm in New Mexico, not India.

01:23:11.772 --> 01:23:14.424
When're you coming home?

01:23:14.624 --> 01:23:17.561
I'll call you later.

01:24:03.294 --> 01:24:05.648
Was it yours?

01:24:07.445 --> 01:24:12.408
No. It's Ernie Ray's.

01:24:12.409 --> 01:24:15.053
Changed the oil recently?

01:24:15.356 --> 01:24:18.508
About an hour and a half ago.

01:24:19.003 --> 01:24:21.084
You've put too much in it.

01:24:21.416 --> 01:24:25.071
Too much oil can cause
spontaneous combustion.

01:24:25.917 --> 01:24:28.420
Can happen.

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:32.242
Pretty unusual, but it sure can happen.

01:24:32.243 --> 01:24:36.508
A lot of unusual things have
been happening to me lately.

01:24:36.509 --> 01:24:41.665
Let's get to the point?

01:24:42.663 --> 01:24:46.235
I'm no intellectual, but I do
know what things are called.

01:24:46.236 --> 01:24:48.025
Do you know what they call this?

01:24:48.026 --> 01:24:49.815
What's happening here
is something enormous.

01:24:50.111 --> 01:24:54.237
Old-fashioned, something
not suit to all anymore.

01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:58.267
And this something has
a rare, precise name,

01:24:58.597 --> 01:25:01.020
trust.

01:25:02.161 --> 01:25:04.805
Let me say that one more time,

01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:08.535
you're not betraying trust.

01:25:08.867 --> 01:25:11.832
I think the Cheyenne,

01:25:12.538 --> 01:25:15.999
I can have a very severe reaction.

01:25:29.239 --> 01:25:32.385
Which sort of weapon are you interested in?

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:37.080
- One that hurts.
- Well, you come to the right place.

01:25:37.081 --> 01:25:39.705
Let me show you something.

01:25:41.412 --> 01:25:43.626
Yeah, you're looking at it.

01:25:43.823 --> 01:25:48.735
The only pistol in the world that has the
power of a rifle, without all the bulk.

01:25:48.736 --> 01:25:53.442
- I don't know the first things about a gun.
- I do.

01:25:55.277 --> 01:26:01.147
That pistol here lets you shoot to
kill with precision from 250 feet.

01:26:02.338 --> 01:26:06.211
And it doesn't just give you
the satisfaction of the kill,

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:13.442
it lets you kill with impunity,
which is a so different ball game.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.717
Believe me, it's an extraordinary
thing to kill with impunity.

01:26:19.168 --> 01:26:24.716
A rare shift in perspective
in a human being's lifestyle.

01:26:27.204 --> 01:26:34.032
If we're licensed to be monsters,
we end up having just one desire...

01:26:35.378 --> 01:26:38.404
truly being monsters.

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:16.875
- Hey, are you really Cheyenne?
- Sorry, what?

01:27:16.876 --> 01:27:19.673
No, I'm just asking.
You're Cheyenne, right?

01:27:19.803 --> 01:27:22.639
No, that's not me.

01:28:44.334 --> 01:28:47.265
May I sit with you?

01:28:50.488 --> 01:28:53.695
Oh, surely, sit down.

01:29:04.489 --> 01:29:07.525
Are you... uh... traveling?

01:29:08.829 --> 01:29:11.406
Sight-seeing.

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:18.375
- Oh, what exactly is the difference?
- I don't know exactly the difference.

01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:24.611
But I always thought that
travelers were pain in the ass.

01:29:25.623 --> 01:29:29.705
I feel the same way.
Death to the backpack.

01:29:30.205 --> 01:29:33.674
That's a good model you have got there.

01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:39.569
It's a nice balance between the
mechanics and... the storage capacity.

01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:43.914
Are you in the luggage business?

01:29:44.806 --> 01:29:46.788
We'll get to that.

01:29:46.789 --> 01:29:51.246
But first, tell me the reason
you wanted to meet me.

01:29:51.247 --> 01:29:54.280
I am looking for a German.

01:29:54.715 --> 01:29:57.590
Well, you come to the right place.

01:29:57.953 --> 01:30:00.840
Germans come here on vacation.

01:30:00.841 --> 01:30:04.496
They love it here.
Reminds 'em of the Alps.

01:30:04.747 --> 01:30:08.263
And when they go back home they
can say they've been to America.

01:30:08.264 --> 01:30:11.309
I am looking for a different kind of German.

01:30:12.492 --> 01:30:17.186
I'm looking for one who lives here,
whose name is Aloise Lange.

01:30:17.902 --> 01:30:20.416
He was a friend of my father's.

01:30:20.575 --> 01:30:24.599
I wanted to pay him a visit.

01:30:25.246 --> 01:30:28.020
Do you know him?

01:30:29.928 --> 01:30:31.703
We will get to that.

01:30:31.704 --> 01:30:37.546
Now, do you remember back when
suitcases with wheels didn't exist?

01:30:38.096 --> 01:30:41.212
You had to carry your bags
or lug them over your shoulder.

01:30:41.213 --> 01:30:46.380
They're always so heavy. Everybody
were sweating and swearing all the time.

01:30:46.656 --> 01:30:49.197
And then someone comes along...

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.858
it was really just a few years
ago if you think about it,

01:30:53.208 --> 01:30:57.216
with the bright idea of
putting wheels on that thing.

01:30:58.415 --> 01:31:03.791
And puff... all at once your
suitcase isn't heavy anymore.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:10.488
And everyday I ask
myself the same question...

01:31:10.489 --> 01:31:13.988
why didn't anyone think of it sooner.

01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:19.898
Why do you ask yourself
the same question everyday?

01:31:19.899 --> 01:31:24.028
Because I'm that someone
who had that bright idea.

01:31:25.838 --> 01:31:29.891
- Are you playing on me?
- No.

01:31:29.907 --> 01:31:31.949
I'll never do such a thing.

01:31:32.218 --> 01:31:34.494
I'm Robert Plath.

01:31:35.032 --> 01:31:37.868
I was a pilot with Northwest Airlines

01:31:37.869 --> 01:31:41.256
and in 1988 I had an idea,

01:31:41.645 --> 01:31:44.624
and so I tested it out in my garage,

01:31:44.753 --> 01:31:47.687
and then I patented it.

01:31:48.209 --> 01:31:54.150
And I won't call it a success...
because it was a revolution.

01:31:54.420 --> 01:32:01.405
Now, there are 150 residents in Hunstville
and only one of them has a German accent.

01:32:02.775 --> 01:32:07.605
He's pretty slight, and
his name isn't Aloise Lange.

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:10.567
He's Peter Smith.

01:32:11.333 --> 01:32:15.358
He lives in a log cabin
on a hill heading east.

01:32:15.803 --> 01:32:18.005
He's older than I am,

01:32:18.214 --> 01:32:21.571
and more handsome, I think.

01:32:22.658 --> 01:32:28.987
And I can't say that I
like this Peter Smith.

01:34:12.233 --> 01:34:15.477
What's this about you, you do
not know if you're coming back?

01:34:17.696 --> 01:34:20.860
I didn't get together with Desmond.

01:34:20.969 --> 01:34:25.560
You're right. I know nothing about boys.

01:34:26.966 --> 01:34:29.738
How are you?

01:34:32.653 --> 01:34:36.139
Last night mom grabbed me my hand

01:34:37.009 --> 01:34:43.306
And she said that pain is
not the final destination.

01:34:44.287 --> 01:34:48.974
What I do understand is
that sometimes people leave.

01:34:49.509 --> 01:34:52.320
My brother left.

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:56.177
And you left.

01:34:58.778 --> 01:35:02.352
Do you hear me, Cheyenne?

01:37:02.594 --> 01:37:08.413
I apologize. But it's the only
way you know I did it on purpose.

01:37:22.604 --> 01:37:29.594
- Aw... How did you get in here?
- Who the fuck do you think I am?

01:37:29.694 --> 01:37:32.734
You know I've spent most of my life
tracking down these bastards,

01:37:32.735 --> 01:37:35.217
who were hiding themselves away
in hotels all over the world,

01:37:35.218 --> 01:37:36.807
and you have the nerve
to ask me how I managed

01:37:36.808 --> 01:37:40.796
to find my way into a tourist
motel in the middle of Utah.

01:37:42.248 --> 01:37:47.242
- How did you know I was here?
- Ah... yeah. America is a tiny place.

01:37:47.243 --> 01:37:50.969
It wasn't easy at first.
No rental car. No cell phone.

01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:55.274
You know, I never have a cell phone and
I never remember you have a cell phone.

01:37:55.621 --> 01:37:58.387
Well, what I'm gonna do? You're
a fuckin' pain in the ass.

01:37:58.474 --> 01:38:02.496
It's a powerful feeling, but it's
softened a bit in your absence.

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.539
It's coming back in full force now.

01:38:05.989 --> 01:38:09.629
Aloise Lange doesn't live here anymore.
He went away.

01:38:09.729 --> 01:38:11.754
He doesn't go by the name
of Aloise Lange anymore.

01:38:11.755 --> 01:38:13.779
He goes by the name of Peter Smith.

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:16.814
Oh fuckin' idiot. Now
you're a detective.

01:38:17.119 --> 01:38:19.676
Pack your beauty case.
We get out of here.

01:38:19.677 --> 01:38:22.755
- Where are we going?
- To the end of life,

01:38:22.756 --> 01:38:25.433
exactly where your friend is.

01:38:27.381 --> 01:38:30.941
- How do you know that?
- I know because my name is Mordecai Midler.

01:38:30.942 --> 01:38:33.608
I know because I have a phone
and 1500 informants.

01:38:33.609 --> 01:38:35.544
I pick it up and dial the
number and find people.

01:38:35.545 --> 01:38:38.279
Now get your things.
I gotta go take a leak.

01:38:46.767 --> 01:38:52.822
Hey Cheyenne, can you give me a hand?
This door... Goddammit, I think it's jammed.

01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:56.212
- Are you kidding?
- No, no.

01:38:56.622 --> 01:38:58.172
That fuckin' thing won't open.

01:38:58.173 --> 01:38:59.516
Alright, do me a favor.

01:38:59.717 --> 01:39:01.859
Call the guy at the reception
desk. He's got a master key.

01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:04.081
No fuckin' way.

01:39:04.082 --> 01:39:09.328
A detective like you who's flushed
out thousands of Nazi criminals

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:14.913
and you can't managed to
get yourself out of the john?

01:39:14.914 --> 01:39:18.265
You gotta be kidding.

01:39:29.642 --> 01:39:33.653
Why did you have to toss
bullshit on me at my age?

01:40:01.697 --> 01:40:03.842
What fine air.

01:40:04.352 --> 01:40:07.727
- Oh... this may seem trivial, but I...
- I was seven years old,

01:40:08.186 --> 01:40:12.973
I saw the numbers on my father's forearm

01:40:12.974 --> 01:40:16.960
and I asked him what
they were and he said...

01:40:16.961 --> 01:40:21.056
I guess he said, I'm quoting,
"that's our telephone number."

01:40:22.451 --> 01:40:25.642
That's why Jews always
dial the wrong number.

01:40:26.045 --> 01:40:28.981
I spent most of my life
in hotel rooms, son.

01:40:29.555 --> 01:40:32.458
Cheap inns inside a car.

01:40:32.742 --> 01:40:35.455
Here and in Argentina, Brazil and Syria.

01:40:35.456 --> 01:40:38.428
You know something?
I loved it.

01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:43.956
And... even something else,
I am convinced that you'll like it too.

01:40:44.056 --> 01:40:48.505
Because I am convinced that you're
in great need of distraction.

01:40:48.676 --> 01:40:51.696
You're right, I liked it.

01:40:51.697 --> 01:40:54.163
Yes, I thought so.

01:40:55.539 --> 01:40:57.647
This place makes me feel so good.

01:40:57.948 --> 01:41:01.755
The mountains make me
feel at peace with the world.

01:41:02.396 --> 01:41:07.177
You know. It's like
putting on a necktie.

01:41:24.126 --> 01:41:26.891
Can you even use that pistol?

01:41:32.762 --> 01:41:36.486
How the fuck did you know I had a pistol?

01:41:36.895 --> 01:41:39.755
Because I know.

01:41:40.273 --> 01:41:43.227
Because I've been at war all my life.

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:46.139
Never ends.

01:41:49.875 --> 01:41:55.247
One. Imitation.

01:41:55.383 --> 01:41:59.507
Hitler had a private study,
2,000 square feet.

01:41:59.795 --> 01:42:03.732
But he kept telling his
architect it was too small.

01:42:03.983 --> 01:42:06.921
Goering built a house just like Hitler's.

01:42:07.449 --> 01:42:10.392
Himmler would have like to have
a house just like Goering's.

01:42:11.099 --> 01:42:13.996
Bormann would have like to have
a house just like Himmler's

01:42:13.997 --> 01:42:18.445
if Himmler had managed
to build one like Goering's.

01:42:20.052 --> 01:42:23.513
Everybody imitated anybody else.

01:42:23.843 --> 01:42:29.602
Everybody but the Jews.
They didn't imitate anyone.

01:42:31.371 --> 01:42:34.189
Two. Humiliation.

01:42:34.530 --> 01:42:36.680
If you want to survive,

01:42:36.681 --> 01:42:40.831
you have to really know the person who
is trying to kill you all the course.

01:42:41.044 --> 01:42:42.948
I survived.

01:42:43.458 --> 01:42:46.384
Your father tried to kill me for years.

01:42:46.716 --> 01:42:49.955
You do the following episode.

01:42:50.393 --> 01:42:57.136
In the winter, '43, during the roll-call.
He did something wrong.

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:59.831
I don't remember what, however,

01:42:59.832 --> 01:43:04.361
but I threatened that the German
shepherd tear him to pieces.

01:43:04.362 --> 01:43:06.241
The dog growled at him.

01:43:06.642 --> 01:43:10.921
He was so scared...
he peed in his pants.

01:43:11.287 --> 01:43:17.825
And I... burst out laughing.

01:43:18.612 --> 01:43:21.157
That's what happened.

01:43:21.871 --> 01:43:25.004
That was his humiliation.

01:43:26.325 --> 01:43:31.541
Compared to the horrors
of Auschwitz, was nothing.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.691
But your father never forgot it.

01:43:36.894 --> 01:43:39.609
He used to write me letters.

01:43:40.038 --> 01:43:45.191
He would say words most atrocious words,

01:43:45.434 --> 01:43:48.619
most beautiful words.

01:43:50.746 --> 01:43:55.802
Letters that my wife, who was a
cruel woman, would sent on to me.

01:43:55.803 --> 01:43:59.266
By the way, she remembered you finally,

01:43:59.267 --> 01:44:02.556
but not because you wee her student.

01:44:04.243 --> 01:44:06.308
I hated your father

01:44:06.658 --> 01:44:12.758
because his obsession for me
made my life impossible.

01:44:13.727 --> 01:44:20.134
But I have to say...
that he completely won me over.

01:44:21.103 --> 01:44:25.412
The unrelenting beauty of revenge.

01:44:25.731 --> 01:44:32.481
The entire life dedicated to
avenging a humiliation.

01:44:34.697 --> 01:44:39.332
That's what we call perseverance.

01:44:39.507 --> 01:44:42.211
Greatness even.

01:44:44.419 --> 01:44:47.665
Three. Theft.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:53.890
The little bicycle. The stolen kiss
in the backyard when you're thirteen.

01:44:54.490 --> 01:44:59.259
Black clouds.
The flu of approaching thunder.

01:44:59.813 --> 01:45:02.049
The ticking of the clock.

01:45:02.050 --> 01:45:04.684
Your mother's warm embrace,

01:45:05.142 --> 01:45:08.633
Your father's smile and caress.

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:13.605
The finger trace on a foggy window.

01:45:14.219 --> 01:45:17.433
The corner seat near the window.

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:22.378
The cozy blanket, when you got a fever.

01:45:22.379 --> 01:45:26.303
The crystal clear Northern European sky.

01:45:28.439 --> 01:45:32.939
Everyone, absolutely everyone,

01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:36.397
was robbed of their youth.

01:45:36.508 --> 01:45:39.552
Everyone, absolutely everyone,

01:45:39.858 --> 01:45:44.026
have their youth stolen from them.

01:45:50.938 --> 01:45:57.885
On the other side of the barbed wire,
we too... we too looked at the snow.

01:45:59.393 --> 01:46:04.277
And... and God...

01:46:04.714 --> 01:46:08.432
God is like...

01:46:09.874 --> 01:46:12.595
God is...

01:46:15.117 --> 01:46:17.439
God...

01:46:22.567 --> 01:46:26.688
Don't mind it.
I can't remember anymore.

01:47:24.342 --> 01:47:30.075
It's so unjust that my father
died before you.

01:47:59.779 --> 01:48:02.833
Oh... shit!

01:49:07.952 --> 01:49:10.810
Something's not quite right here.

01:49:11.167 --> 01:49:14.108
I'm not sure what exactly.

01:49:14.833 --> 01:49:17.510
But something.

01:50:01.355 --> 01:50:04.386
Listen, I have to tell you something.

01:50:04.711 --> 01:50:07.236
Your father loved you.

01:50:09.827 --> 01:50:12.487
How do you know that?

01:50:13.953 --> 01:50:16.904
He told me.

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:23.716
That's not true,
but it's nice of you to say.

01:50:35.866 --> 01:50:38.325
Go on.

01:52:28.039 --> 01:52:31.712
When during the inferno,

01:52:31.966 --> 01:52:35.878
we too from the other
side of the barbed wire...

01:52:36.789 --> 01:52:42.473
we too looked at the snow...
and at God.

01:52:42.674 --> 01:52:49.449
That's how God is...
an infant in a stupefying form.

01:52:50.076 --> 01:52:56.917
Beautiful, lazy, and still
with no desire to do anything,

01:52:58.891 --> 01:53:03.525
like certain women who, when we were boys,

01:53:04.039 --> 01:53:09.025
we only dared dream about.
