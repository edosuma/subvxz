11:14.541 --> 11:17.108
What's his name?

11:17.110 --> 11:19.210
Mickey.
Mickey...

11:19.212 --> 11:20.845
Felton.
Mickey felton.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.747
Is mickey felton
here today?

11:24.550 --> 11:26.584
Can you tell us
where he is?

11:31.891 --> 11:33.658
That him in there?

11:33.660 --> 11:34.793
[clears throat]

11:34.795 --> 11:37.629
Come out, douche bag!
Hey, okay.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.998
You guys got here
faster than I thought.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.299
You knew
we were coming?

11:41.301 --> 11:42.901
You're not here
to take me in, are you?

11:42.903 --> 11:45.570
He's the one you oughta be--
why don't you
just let me decide that?

11:45.572 --> 11:47.972
One simple question:

11:47.974 --> 11:50.575
Did you sell dean iverson
a gram of coke?

11:50.577 --> 11:52.343
One time only.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.579
And I hope that he's not
telling you otherwise.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.815
And when was it exactly?
Two weeks ago
yesterday.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.483
I went to reno
to help my granddad.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.319
By the time I came back,
it was all over the news.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.322
I'm sor--what--
what was all over the news?

12:04.324 --> 12:06.758
What do you mean "what"?
The dead kid.

12:08.661 --> 12:09.794
Detective carver.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.699
Do you mean
danny solano?

12:14.701 --> 12:16.735
Yeah, I saw his picture.
I recognized him right away.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.774
Okay, mickey, I'm gonna have
you start over again,

12:22.776 --> 12:26.344
And I'm--I'm gonna want you
to be very clear here.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.847
You met danny solano.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.716
Did you meet him
through dean?

12:31.718 --> 12:33.752
I wouldn't say
that I met him.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.787
He came with dean
for the coke.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.522
He stayed back
on the bike.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.357
The two of them
were fighting about something.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.794
Kid pissed dean off
big time.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.130
Isn't that why
you're here?

13:06.218 --> 13:07.919
You're coming
to dinner tonight.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.388
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from me?

13:10.390 --> 13:13.057
I got the menu
all worked out.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.225
You need to eat.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.629
Think I'll survive.
Let's hope so.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.964
What the hell
does that mean?

13:19.966 --> 13:23.101
I don't want anything
to do with you.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.737
You don't have
a choice, vince.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.739
You and I
need to talk.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.642
We have
to work this out...

13:30.644 --> 13:32.076
Together.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.813
I'll see you
at 8:00.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.789
That was a long run.
Where were you?
My mom just called me.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.524
What's this picture
they're showing around?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.159
Why haven't we seen it?
Well, we have seen it.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.794
No, I've seen it.
It's right there.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.096
Right where?
Did ellie bring it?

13:52.098 --> 13:53.698
No, pete did.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.934
Well, this is
from chloe's school.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.870
Why can't they
tell us anything?
It's right here.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.310
They're saying that danny
had his number in his jacket.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.778
I mean, you think
that they would tell us

14:06.780 --> 14:08.880
More than just that,
you know?

14:08.882 --> 14:11.349
Where you going?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.851
Beth!

14:21.460 --> 14:23.962
Raymond connelly.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.964
Father.
Hey.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.899
You're not
a congregant, I know,

14:27.901 --> 14:30.668
But I was wondering,
could you and I talk a moment?

14:30.670 --> 14:32.670
Uh...Sure.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.808
It's from a place
of concern.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.877
Beth solano came
to see me this morning.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.212
Oh, I hope
I didn't upset her.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.680
I never meant to.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.849
I think she didn't
quite know what to make

14:44.851 --> 14:46.818
Of what you told her.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.820
A lot of it
wasn't very specific.

14:48.822 --> 14:50.588
Like, I wish
I could've said more.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.224
No, better
you said less.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.496
Listen,
I have a name here

14:58.498 --> 15:02.667
Of someone you might want
to speak with instead.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.669
Gina weston's
a friend of mine.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.838
She's in kinnelon,
highly regarded, discreet.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.773
She's a psychiatrist.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.675
The choice is yours,
of course,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.677
But I'm sure you know
that hearing voices--

15:12.679 --> 15:14.712
The voices I hear
are different.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.115
You should get that,
I'd think.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.716
Some things
are spiritual.
Yes, I know.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.686
Then why did you
give me the card?

15:21.688 --> 15:23.521
The fact is,
I find it inappropriate--

15:23.523 --> 15:24.923
I find it inappropriate

15:24.925 --> 15:26.958
For you to harass
a grieving woman,

15:26.960 --> 15:28.293
Someone you don't
even know,

15:28.295 --> 15:31.129
Pretending
to offer guidance.

15:31.131 --> 15:35.767
If the solanos need help,
they've got me to turn to.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.703
Me.

15:38.705 --> 15:42.707
You leave them alone.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.310
I'll let you
get back to work.

15:50.049 --> 15:53.584
Father.

15:53.586 --> 15:57.388
I'm...Very glad
that beth has you.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.958
I know how close
you used to be.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.666
(emmett)
did you fight
with danny solano a lot?

16:08.668 --> 16:11.169
No, I did not.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.904
Do you want to revise
your earlier comment

16:12.906 --> 16:15.239
That you hardly
knew danny?

16:15.241 --> 16:16.574
No.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.743
And yet, though
you hardly knew him,

16:18.745 --> 16:20.745
Danny found himself
on the back of your motorcycle

16:20.747 --> 16:22.180
A couple of weeks ago.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.616
You were on your way to buy
drugs for your girlfriend,

16:25.618 --> 16:27.952
Who happens
to be danny's sister,

16:27.954 --> 16:29.087
And your dealer
sees you...

16:29.089 --> 16:30.254
He's not my dealer.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.422
Outside his house
yelling at danny.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.623
I wasn't yelling at him.

16:32.625 --> 16:36.361
That doesn't sound
like someone you hardly knew.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.798
Danny was a lonely kid,
all right?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.867
He was always looking
for a friend.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.603
Sometimes he'd ask me
to hang out,

16:45.605 --> 16:47.705
Take him for rides,
play video games.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.307
He was my son's
best friend.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.043
Well, I never saw them
together.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.878
After danny quit
his dad's soccer team,

16:53.880 --> 16:56.647
He spent
a lot of time alone.

16:56.649 --> 17:00.685
Said mr. Solano
was disappointed in him.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.286
He told me one day,

17:02.288 --> 17:04.455
"nobody knows me.

17:04.457 --> 17:08.159
Nobody has any idea
what I really think."

17:08.161 --> 17:09.861
What do you think
he meant by that?

17:11.497 --> 17:12.663
(ellie)
you didn't ask him?

17:12.665 --> 17:15.133
How did danny end up
on your motorcycle?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.801
After chloe asked
if I knew

17:16.803 --> 17:20.038
Where to get
this tiny amount of coke,

17:20.040 --> 17:24.175
I was driving up the 101,
and I see this kid.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.345
It's danny,
so I pull over.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.746
Ask him if he's okay.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.715
Tell him he shouldn't be walking
out of town like that.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.383
Did you ask him
where he was going?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.085
He just started begging
for a ride,

17:34.087 --> 17:36.487
So I gave him
my helmet.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.689
I figured
I'd take him home later.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.858
He'd be safer that way.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.494
What were you arguing about
in winstead?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.663
I stopped for gas

17:45.665 --> 17:47.865
At the station up the road,

17:47.867 --> 17:52.503
And when I went in
to pay...

17:52.505 --> 17:54.005
Danny followed me in.

17:54.007 --> 17:56.841
And then when we got
off the bike at mickey's,

17:56.843 --> 18:00.678
I saw he had
this new crossword book

18:00.680 --> 18:03.347
And, like--like,
a souvenir pin.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.516
He said he swiped it
like he was proud.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.185
I was telling him
not to do that,

18:07.187 --> 18:09.220
Not to steal stuff.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.621
Teaching him
the eighth commandment

18:10.623 --> 18:12.757
While you're buying cocaine.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.627
Where were you
last Thursday night,

18:16.629 --> 18:18.930
The night
danny disappeared?

18:23.702 --> 18:25.169
Dean.

18:29.575 --> 18:30.975
I was working
at my uncle's restaurant,

18:30.977 --> 18:32.210
All right?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.578
He lets me live
next to the place

18:33.580 --> 18:36.314
As long as I work
three shifts a week.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.249
I clocked in.
I clocked out.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.384
Go check.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.320
And he'll probably
freak out on me

18:42.322 --> 18:43.788
For bringing
the cops around,

18:43.790 --> 18:46.057
Maybe even kick me out,

18:46.059 --> 18:48.292
But what do you care?

18:48.294 --> 18:51.229
I'll take the uncle.
You take the gas station.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.396
See if anyone
remembers them.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.232
See if they have
cameras.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.667
Sir, what happened
earlier?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.903
What?
On the docks,
you looked--

18:58.905 --> 19:00.004
(woman)
detective miller?

19:00.006 --> 19:01.506
Yes.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.609
Beth solano--she's been
sitting there for an hour.

19:04.611 --> 19:05.676
[sighs]

19:05.678 --> 19:07.912
Beth, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.248
Were you talking to him
while I was sitting here?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.316
No, we weren't
talking to him.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.852
Well, who were you
talking to?

19:14.854 --> 19:19.190
Why don't you come in here?
We can talk privately.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.092
I'm sorry, beth.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.627
I'm not
at liberty to say.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.829
What else are
you sorry for, ellie?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.430
Are you sorry
you haven't told us

19:26.432 --> 19:27.765
What's going on
in three days?

19:27.767 --> 19:28.933
Are you sorry
you haven't told us

19:28.935 --> 19:30.034
Who the hell
this person is?

19:30.036 --> 19:31.802
Why you're asking everyone
about him,

19:31.804 --> 19:32.937
Everyone except me?

19:32.939 --> 19:35.473
I told pete to show
you and mark his picture.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.975
I don't want pete
to show us the picture, ellie.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.310
I don't want
to talk to pete.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.612
I want to talk to you,
but you avoid us.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.448
You tell us nothing.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.551
I am truly sorry, beth.
I--

19:46.553 --> 19:48.452
And you should be
talking to us,

19:48.454 --> 19:51.956
Especially about this,
because I have met this person.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.359
What?
I have met
this person!

20:05.804 --> 20:07.572
He came
into the visitor's center.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.174
It was my Wednesday shift
three weeks ago.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.810
And you're certain
it was him.
Yeah, no question.

20:12.812 --> 20:16.747
He had this gigantic
green backpack.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.650
He had short--
really short hair.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.920
A beard.
He smelled like propane.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.488
Asked about campgrounds.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.423
I gave him the map,

20:25.425 --> 20:28.092
Then he asked
about hunting permits,

20:28.094 --> 20:31.662
And I-I told him
it was off-season.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.598
Did he say
anything else?

20:33.600 --> 20:36.534
He was strange, ellie.

20:36.536 --> 20:41.539
Perfectly civil,
but odd.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.741
He also--

20:45.244 --> 20:47.445
What?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.080
He noticed a picture
of danny and chloe

20:49.082 --> 20:51.515
On my desk.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.284
He asked
if they were my kids.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.053
(ellie)
so he asked about danny.

20:56.055 --> 20:59.423
He said that I had
a beautiful family.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.696
Beth, it's all right.
Okay?

21:05.698 --> 21:08.766
We will find him.
Will you?

21:10.702 --> 21:13.638
[ominous music]

21:13.640 --> 21:21.779
â™ª

21:30.222 --> 21:32.857
[honk honking]

21:36.762 --> 21:38.229
(mark)
I just drove by our savior,

21:38.231 --> 21:42.333
And there's a picture of danny
in that little display thing.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.734
Paul must've put it there.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.069
Oh, yeah,
you think?

21:45.071 --> 21:47.505
And there's a little quote
that says something about

21:47.507 --> 21:48.606
Lightness and dark

21:48.608 --> 21:51.075
And that it's okay
that danny's dead

21:51.077 --> 21:52.576
Because god's
gonna make it okay.

21:52.578 --> 21:54.478
I doubt
that's what it says.
Yeah?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.580
Can you tell him
to take it down?
Mark.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.082
What--it's not gonna
stay up there.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.684
I almost
ripped it out myself.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.486
Why don't you call paul
and talk about it?

22:02.488 --> 22:03.988
Because I want nothing
to do with him.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.423
I never have,

22:05.425 --> 22:07.692
Not for christmas,
not for easter,

22:07.694 --> 22:08.793
Not for freaking
Sunday school,

22:08.795 --> 22:10.094
Which you know
danny hated,

22:10.096 --> 22:14.265
And especially
not now.

22:14.267 --> 22:17.535
Where you going?
<i>I'm getting dressed.</i>

22:17.537 --> 22:18.636
[sighs]
god.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.938
You should see
what he's doing.

22:20.940 --> 22:25.776
He went on tv twice,
talking for the family,

22:25.778 --> 22:26.877
Pushing this
memorial service.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.979
He's not pushing it.
It's something I want.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.781
Well, I don't want it.

22:30.783 --> 22:31.882
You know
what he's doing?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.217
He's trying to get
in between us.

22:33.219 --> 22:36.787
Do you see that?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.789
Are you gonna leave
so I can change,

22:38.791 --> 22:41.359
Or should I go
into the bathroom?

22:43.662 --> 22:44.862
You can't be naked
in front of me?

22:44.864 --> 22:48.699
Not right now.
I don't feel like it.

22:53.805 --> 22:55.806
<i>(owen)</i>
<i>aunt ellie.</i>
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

22:55.808 --> 22:57.641
You are stubborn.
Don't even ask.

22:57.643 --> 22:58.976
It's not about
the case.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.178
Well, I'm sure
it can wait.
It's about mom.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.580
I checked in
with her support group,

23:02.582 --> 23:04.081
And she hasn't
been there in weeks.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.316
And I talked to her.

23:05.318 --> 23:06.751
She said she's been out
most nights

23:06.753 --> 23:07.985
At some knitting club.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.020
Well, tell her
I could use a new hat.

23:10.022 --> 23:13.657
I went to the bank machine
yesterday.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.693
Cleaned me out.
I thought
she was getting better.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.761
Yeah, so did I,

23:16.763 --> 23:18.229
But I tried to talk
to her about it.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.698
She either denies or...
Hangs up the phone on me.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.266
I know you're busy.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.502
I just--I don't know
what else to do right now.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.737
I'll go see her.
I don't know when, but I will.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.740
Hang in there,
okay?

23:48.794 --> 23:51.195
(emmett)
I checked the uncle.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.764
Dean was working
in the restaurant that night.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.702
What have we got here?

23:58.704 --> 24:01.639
Um, it's danny
in the gas station,

24:01.641 --> 24:02.740
Just like dean said,

24:02.742 --> 24:06.644
But it's like I...

24:06.646 --> 24:08.312
I don't recognize him.

24:08.314 --> 24:12.149
I--it's danny, but I--

24:12.151 --> 24:13.751
I don't know this child.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.986
Our angel wasn't
such an angel after all.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.755
What does that mean?

24:17.757 --> 24:20.224
What, that he got
what he deserved?

24:20.226 --> 24:22.159
Please tell me
that's not what you're saying.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.261
It's just that this
fills in the picture

24:24.263 --> 24:26.831
A little more clearly.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.933
What did his mom want?
You talk to her?

24:28.935 --> 24:33.404
She said she met pierson
at the tourist office

24:33.406 --> 24:35.306
The day before
he talked to danny.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.741
He came in looking
for a hunting permit.

24:37.743 --> 24:41.178
We...We really need
to find this guy.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.513
Yeah, I'm aware
of that.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.515
And she also was very upset
about the fact

24:44.517 --> 24:46.584
That we've been keeping her
in the dark.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.586
Okay. They want
to know everything,

24:48.588 --> 24:49.787
We'll show them
everything.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.590
No, I--
let's send dean
on his way,

24:52.592 --> 24:54.692
Go show 'em the tape.
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

24:54.694 --> 24:56.994
In this case, I don't think
that is a good idea.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.763
They don't need to see
this sort of thing.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.866
Beth is disturbed enough
as it is.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.602
Follow the evidence.
Inform the family.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.871
Don't get
emotionally involved.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.340
We'll visit
the solanos tonight.

25:34.332 --> 25:35.900
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>all right, you can go.</i>

25:38.670 --> 25:40.804
Hope you're happy.

25:40.806 --> 25:42.406
I'd be happier
if you could give us

25:42.408 --> 25:43.807
Fingerprints
and a cheek swab

25:43.809 --> 25:45.009
Before you go.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.011
Do I have to?

25:47.013 --> 25:48.579
Well, strictly speaking,
it's voluntary,

25:48.581 --> 25:50.681
But we'd advise it;
it's a big help.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.249
Then you'll file
that away,

25:52.251 --> 25:53.651
And then ten years
from now

25:53.653 --> 25:54.919
When someone thinks
my fingerprints

25:54.921 --> 25:56.520
Look a tiny bit
like someone else's,

25:56.522 --> 25:57.688
I end up in prison.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.557
No, thank you.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.893
Just trying to fully
eliminate you from the picture.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.662
You talked to my uncle,
didn't you?

26:04.664 --> 26:06.664
Doesn't that fully eliminate me
from the picture,

26:06.666 --> 26:08.432
Or are you having
a hard time believing

26:08.434 --> 26:09.700
The ethnic folk
in town?

26:09.702 --> 26:11.435
Dean, don't.

26:11.437 --> 26:12.870
I have to go home
and deal with him now.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.405
Thank you for that.

26:20.545 --> 26:22.212
(susan)
I'll take
the dark one.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.714
It's a good-looking bird.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.249
20.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.289
I'll bring him out back,
then deliver him to you.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.225
No, it's all right.
I'll take him now.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.928
Got a special guest
coming to dinner tonight.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.709
Hey.

26:51.711 --> 26:54.144
Yeah.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.981
You're a good one.

26:59.751 --> 27:01.151
[bones snap]

27:04.389 --> 27:06.724
A dead 12-year-old boy
had pierson's cell phone number

27:06.726 --> 27:07.958
Stuffed into his pocket.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.892
You don't think
it's reasonable

27:08.894 --> 27:10.494
To take a look
around his property,

27:10.496 --> 27:11.829
Find out if he's got something
of danny's, maybe?

27:11.831 --> 27:13.597
His cell phone, which
we're still searching for.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.799
I want to take a look
as much as you do...
Don't bet on it.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.968
But the judge doesn't believe
we've got reasonable cause.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.737
Find a new judge.

Please do not
call me emmett.

Please don't walk out on me
while I'm talking to you.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.947
Pierson's discharge
from the army--

27:29.949 --> 27:31.081
Pretty impossible

27:31.083 --> 27:32.916
To break through
military confidentiality,

27:32.918 --> 27:34.852
But palmerton police
spoke to a pharmacist

27:34.854 --> 27:36.253
Near his home.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.955
Eight months ago,
he renewed a prescription--

27:37.957 --> 27:39.790
Risperidone.

27:39.792 --> 27:40.624
What's risperidone?

27:40.626 --> 27:43.427
An anti-psychotic.

I'm so sorry.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.596
Your mom said
you were back here,

28:52.598 --> 28:55.566
And I was wondering if you'd
help me fix my skateboard.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.668
The wheels have been sticking,
and I can't figure out why.

28:57.670 --> 29:01.472
Yeah, just put it top-down
right here.

So how you been,

<i>How you holding up?</i>

what happened to danny?

29:16.788 --> 29:18.589
Well, she have
any ideas?

29:18.591 --> 29:20.858
I don't know.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.593
I hardly
ever see her anymore.

you're here?

30:08.407 --> 30:10.140

drunk-dial, would you?

You wouldn't
drunk-dial anybody.

You're so...
You're so even-keeled,

say secret, should I?

Listen, I hope
that you don't judge me.

asked to go, begged.

No, danny would not
have done that.

want to know is

33:51.130 --> 33:52.729
Whether
this incident connects

33:52.731 --> 33:55.132
To the money
in danny's room.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.800
We're hoping
maybe you know something.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.068
Well, you should've asked us
about the money

33:58.070 --> 33:59.202
When you found it.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.570
You wait this long
to tell us?

34:00.572 --> 34:02.472
<i>When did you</i>
<i>get the tape?</i>
<i>Today.</i>

34:02.474 --> 34:04.307
<i>Beth was very clear</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

34:04.309 --> 34:06.743
And we can understand
how frustrating--

34:06.745 --> 34:08.178
No, yeah, that's
one word for it, yeah.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.747
We want to be as open
as possible from now on,

34:10.749 --> 34:13.083
And we want to explain
everything to you.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.251
Except you're not,
ellie.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.187
Nothing you are saying
is making any sense.

34:17.189 --> 34:19.089
Today, there was
this backpacker.

34:19.091 --> 34:21.191
Now you're showing us
someone else

34:21.193 --> 34:24.494
Who took our son
to buy cocaine.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.197
I mean, who--
who even is he?

34:27.199 --> 34:28.865
How did he meet danny?

34:28.867 --> 34:30.767
That's...

34:30.769 --> 34:34.704
That's
chloe's boyfriend.

34:34.706 --> 34:37.174
What?

34:37.176 --> 34:38.341
I saw 'em together.

34:38.343 --> 34:41.411
They were--
they were together.

34:44.182 --> 34:47.851
Is that true, chloe?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.553
Is it?
He didn't
hurt danny.

34:49.555 --> 34:53.123
Oh, my god.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.925
You knew this?

34:58.029 --> 34:59.229
When did
you see them, mark?

34:59.231 --> 35:01.631
This afternoon,
right off main street.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.533
And you say nothing?
You are worse than they are.

35:03.535 --> 35:04.935
No, no, I'm trying
to protect you.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.236
I knew that
it would upset you!

35:06.238 --> 35:07.971
And this wouldn't?
This wouldn't, mark?

35:07.973 --> 35:09.473
To find out this way
from them,

35:09.475 --> 35:10.707
That my daughter

35:10.709 --> 35:11.708
Is seeing
a drug dealer?
No, no!

35:11.710 --> 35:14.811
[all shouting at once]

35:17.482 --> 35:19.483
No, I can't--
I can't do this anymore.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.484
Chloe!

35:20.486 --> 35:22.252
Damn it,
get back here!

35:22.254 --> 35:24.254
Nice work.
Nice work.

<i>No, not now.</i>
<i>I don't want to talk about it.</i>

35:33.732 --> 35:35.065
I do.

35:35.067 --> 35:37.300
Did you really
not know about it?

35:37.302 --> 35:40.570
What else
don't you know?

35:40.572 --> 35:42.339
They're telling me
that he's 17,

35:42.341 --> 35:43.907
Almost 18 years old.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.809
He is.
Dating
a 15-year-old.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.911
Sound familiar?
No, no,
don't give me that.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.079
Go ahead
and ask, dad.

35:49.081 --> 35:51.281
I know
you're dying to.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.316
Are you having sex?
Yes.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.918
Except we're using condoms,

35:54.920 --> 35:56.319
Which is more
than you and mom did.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.255
You know what?
You can't talk to me like that.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.123
No, I can, actually.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.858
I got you
out of a holding cell,

36:01.860 --> 36:04.127
Because I saw how you
and gemma fisher

36:04.129 --> 36:05.262
Were looking
at each other

36:05.264 --> 36:06.296
While I was working
at the inn.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.131
It makes me sick
to even think about it.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.767
I probably changed
your sheets.

36:10.769 --> 36:14.471
Do you want to talk
about that too?

36:14.473 --> 36:17.440
[suspenseful music]

36:45.736 --> 36:47.571
I hope you're happy.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.906
Why is everyone
saying that to me today?

36:49.908 --> 36:50.907
I'm never happy.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.509
Well, you deserve
to be as miserable

36:52.511 --> 36:53.910
As you make
everyone else.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.245
I didn't say
I was miserable.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.681
Do you know
what you just did?

36:57.683 --> 36:59.482
All that family
had left

36:59.484 --> 37:01.151
Was the memory
of their son,

37:01.153 --> 37:02.219
And you just
shattered it.

37:02.221 --> 37:05.222
Maybe it deserved
to be shattered.
What?

37:05.224 --> 37:06.523
Who says
such a thing?

37:06.525 --> 37:08.024
How can you
even justify--

37:08.026 --> 37:10.827
Because they wanted
to know everything.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.897
'cause I turn every stone,
maybe I find something.

37:13.899 --> 37:17.067
I have one goal.
One goal.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.168
To find danny's killer.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.769
Now, maybe you don't share
that goal.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.838
What?
Maybe some things
are more important to you.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.373
Nothing is
more important to me

37:23.375 --> 37:24.608
Than finding danny's--

37:24.610 --> 37:29.045
You know, I just can't--
I cannot--I just--

37:29.047 --> 37:31.681
Why don't you come
for dinner?
What?

37:31.683 --> 37:34.050
Now?
No, not now.

37:34.052 --> 37:36.353
Another time.
Why?

37:36.355 --> 37:38.788
Because you are
new in town.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.191
Because that's
what people do

37:41.193 --> 37:43.360
When someone
is new in town.

37:43.362 --> 37:46.196
You invite them over
to your house for dinner,

37:46.198 --> 37:48.531
Especially when that person
is your boss.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.367
That's what people do.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.068
When?
I don't know.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.904
I didn't ask.
My husband is inviting you.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.140
So why don't
we say tomorrow?

37:57.142 --> 37:59.276
What will
we talk about?

37:59.278 --> 38:02.779
I have no idea.
Hopefully not work.

38:02.781 --> 38:06.316
Could you just say yes?
Please just say the word yes.

38:06.318 --> 38:09.552
Yes.
Okay, excellent.

38:09.554 --> 38:14.557
It will be so nice
to have you in my home.

38:14.559 --> 38:15.992

Hey.
Hey.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.953
It's you.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.989
Now, that's what I call
a welcome.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.857
Feel all warm
and special inside.

38:47.859 --> 38:52.195
No, I-I wasn't--
I wasn't expecting you, sorry.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.336
You okay?

38:59.338 --> 39:01.805
Yes, why?

39:01.807 --> 39:04.774
It's just I saw you
at the police station

39:04.776 --> 39:07.377
Around lunchtime
talking to detective miller.

39:07.379 --> 39:10.347
You looked really upset.
I got concerned.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.715
Yeah.

39:11.717 --> 39:15.452
Well, you know,
ellie's my aunt, so...

39:15.454 --> 39:17.587
We were talking
about family stuff.

My mother
is having problems,

39:23.128 --> 39:27.130

Well, we've all got
our problems.

if I should stay here or leave.

Leave?
Leave, like, gracepoint?

to want me around.

what you want yet.

your troubles for a while?

What for?

about chloe.

I wake up...

41:36.428 --> 41:39.262
I think maybe--

41:39.264 --> 41:40.530
Maybe they'll tell us
something.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.966
Maybe--I don't know--
they'll call

41:42.968 --> 41:44.000
Or show up

41:44.002 --> 41:48.104
Or, god,
tell us what happened

To danny,
and instead,

How little we knew him.

such a fool.

my own family.
