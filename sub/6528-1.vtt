00:23.740 --> 00:27.574
Take out the papers and the trash

00:27.644 --> 00:31.478
Or you don't get
no spendin' cash

00:31.548 --> 00:35.348
If you don't scrub
that kitchen floor

00:35.418 --> 00:37.750
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

00:37.821 --> 00:39.482
- Yakety yak
- Don't talk back

00:39.556 --> 00:43.287
Just finished cleaning up
your room

00:43.359 --> 00:47.227
Let's see that dust mop
hit that broom

00:47.297 --> 00:50.926
Get all that garbage
out of sight

00:51.000 --> 00:53.264
Or you don't go out
Friday night

00:53.336 --> 00:55.133
- Yakety yak
- Don't talk back

00:55.205 --> 00:58.902
You just put on
your coat and hat

00:58.975 --> 01:02.775
And walk yourself
to the laundromat

01:02.846 --> 01:06.714
And when you've finished
doing that

01:06.783 --> 01:08.876
Bring in the dog
and put out the cat

01:08.952 --> 01:10.920
- Yakety yak
- Don't talk back

01:26.269 --> 01:29.864
You just put on
your coat and hat

01:29.939 --> 01:33.932
And walk yourself
to the laundromat

01:34.010 --> 01:37.673
And when you've finished
doing that

01:37.747 --> 01:39.942
Bring in the dog
and put out the cat

01:40.016 --> 01:42.814
- Yakety yak
- Don't talk back

01:57.400 --> 02:09.711
Yakety yak, yakety yak

02:09.779 --> 02:13.237
You messed up the words, Ben.
You messed up the words twice.

02:13.316 --> 02:16.683
Oh, wow!
It hasn't changed.

02:16.753 --> 02:20.689
I would've thought
they made some improvements.

02:20.757 --> 02:23.191
Come on, everybody,

02:23.259 --> 02:26.524
Our Lady of Victory, pray for us.
Break! Let's go.

02:26.596 --> 02:30.896
Ooh!
Watch the doors.

02:30.967 --> 02:32.958
Whoa!
Trees in the parking lot.

02:36.472 --> 02:40.499
Oh!
Nature all around us, boys.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.842
Take it in,
take it all in.

02:45.048 --> 02:49.314
I'm gonna go check us in.

02:49.385 --> 02:52.320
This is great.

03:05.068 --> 03:08.526
Well? Is this a real
North Woods lodge or what?

03:08.605 --> 03:10.732
Mm-hmm.

03:10.807 --> 03:13.605
Check out the shotgun lamp.

03:13.676 --> 03:17.339
Isn't that something, huh?
You don't see that every day.

03:17.413 --> 03:19.472
Hey.

03:19.549 --> 03:23.246
Hello!
Anybody home?

03:23.319 --> 03:27.688
- Looks the same, doesn't it?
- Doesn't it? Smells the same too.

03:27.757 --> 03:30.191
Yeah, it does.
Hello!

03:30.260 --> 03:34.321
- I wonder if they have a lot of
check-ins. - Hmm. What's this over here?

03:34.397 --> 03:40.165
- "For prompt service, blow me." An interesting touch.
- It's charming.

03:40.236 --> 03:43.262
- Blow it. - Shall
I? - Go ahead.

03:50.513 --> 03:52.674
Yeah!

03:52.749 --> 03:57.345
Whoa! Whoo. Geez!

03:59.155 --> 04:01.749
Folks, don't mind Wormer.
She hates people.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.952
Wormer, shut the frig up.
What can I do you for?

04:05.028 --> 04:08.191
What happened to that,
uh... that dog's face?

04:08.264 --> 04:11.324
Porcupine quills.
Loves porcupines, hates people.

04:11.401 --> 04:14.097
She's in heat too.
Too bad you're not a dog.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.297
What can I do you for?

04:24.514 --> 04:28.109
Wally, your dog
ever had a bath before?

04:28.184 --> 04:32.553
There she is.
That's a gorgeous cabin.

04:32.622 --> 04:35.614
Okay, hold it, hold it!
That's good enough.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.661
Honey, that's bigger
than our honeymoon cabin.

04:38.728 --> 04:42.494
You city-dwelling fools
are damn lucky to have this cabin.

04:42.565 --> 04:47.025
- It just became available yesterday.
- We call it "the loon's nest."

04:47.103 --> 04:49.731
- You know what a loon is, noodlehead?
- We have one in our family.

04:49.806 --> 04:51.273
Hey, hey.

04:51.341 --> 04:53.571
We had a fishing party in there
until yesterday.

04:53.643 --> 04:57.306
They caught their limit, and then blew.
It's redecorated inside.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.713
- Every bit of it.
- Me and Wally sunk over $300 into it.

05:00.783 --> 05:04.583
- And that's not counting what we spent on lysol.
- Is that right?

05:04.654 --> 05:07.282
You folks enjoy your stay.

05:07.357 --> 05:10.417
Thank you very much. How could
you not in a place like this?

05:10.493 --> 05:12.984
You could get the shits
from the well water.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.622
- What did he say?
- I missed it.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.693
What a gas!

05:44.761 --> 05:47.525
Chet's gonna shit a solid-gold brick!
What a great surprise!

05:47.597 --> 05:51.260
I'll go see where
he's bivouacked the family.

05:51.334 --> 05:54.064
This is very unfair, Roman.

05:54.137 --> 05:57.231
What the hell are you talkin' about?
We're a family!

05:57.306 --> 06:00.434
How many times have we invited Chet
and Connie to the islands? A dozen?

06:00.510 --> 06:04.844
- This is a little different. We weren't invited.
- They'll be tickled to see us.

06:04.914 --> 06:09.146
Honey, I found out what was
stinkin' up the shower.

06:09.218 --> 06:11.982
A present from me to you.

06:13.556 --> 06:17.117
How thoughtful. That's really nice.
Put it with all the others.

06:17.193 --> 06:19.821
There's fish all over this
house. Look it, here's one.

06:19.896 --> 06:23.662
All right, let's leave
this stuff right here, okay?

06:23.733 --> 06:26.566
You put your bathing suit on,
and we'll go down to the lake.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.003
No, you go ahead.
I can't seem to relax in filth.

06:30.073 --> 06:32.906
We'll all pitch in later
and clean this up. Let's go.

06:32.975 --> 06:36.001
You know, we can't even use the bathroom
until someone finds the toilet seat?

06:36.079 --> 06:37.944
Buck already found the toilet
seat. It was on the sunporch.

06:38.014 --> 06:41.609
- Sunporch? It makes you wonder, doesn't it?
- No further excuses.

06:41.684 --> 06:45.586
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. You know, the kids are at the lake.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.146
- Chet, stop. What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

06:48.224 --> 06:52.718
- Honey, no!
- We got the house to ourselves.

06:52.795 --> 06:55.593
Oh, no! What happened?
I'm sorry.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.192
I just don't feel like this. Can you
understand? I'm tired, I'm stinky.

06:59.268 --> 07:01.429
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

07:01.504 --> 07:05.099
- We got the house to ourselves.
- I don't care!

07:05.174 --> 07:08.007
Don't do this here.
Let's go to the bedroom.

07:08.077 --> 07:12.275
Why? That's the great thing
about being in the North Woods.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.078
- What are you feeding me now?
- Come on!

07:15.151 --> 07:18.678
You can run around here naked as a bear
and not worry about running into anybody.

07:18.754 --> 07:22.588
- Is that right? Really?
- Yes.

07:22.658 --> 07:26.958
You think it's possible that we
could play fashion parade?

07:27.029 --> 07:29.759
- I don't wanna play fashion parade.
- Why?

07:29.832 --> 07:34.496
- You get to wear the good outfits!
- I'll let you wear 'em.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.629
You will be...
Shelana!

07:36.706 --> 07:39.971
Shelana,
the oak tree woman.

07:40.042 --> 07:43.307
- Oh, I love it when I'm the oak tree woman!
- Temptress of the woods.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.404
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

07:45.481 --> 07:49.247
And I will be... Burt.
A guy named Burt.

07:49.318 --> 07:53.584
I love it when you're Burt.

07:53.656 --> 07:56.352
Or I could be
Smokey's cousin, Horny.

07:56.425 --> 07:59.485
- He has endurance.
- Yes, he does.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.588
Anybody home?

08:06.068 --> 08:08.127
Shelana the wood's temptress?

08:08.204 --> 08:10.934
With Horny the Bear,
Smokey's cousin?

08:12.441 --> 08:15.035
Okay, okay.

08:15.111 --> 08:18.547
- Turn that off. Turn it off.
- No, Chester, you said it.

08:18.614 --> 08:21.082
Do it on the floor.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.482
Beautiful shot.
Hey, that's all right.

08:23.553 --> 08:27.580
Game playing, role playing. Helps in
a marriage after a little while.

08:27.657 --> 08:31.491
Turn the damn thing off!
Turn it off.

08:31.561 --> 08:35.621
That was quite a surprise.

08:35.698 --> 08:39.030
You got me.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.662
And the whole week
you'll be here!

08:42.738 --> 08:44.569
Okay.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.303
Oh, wow!
Just somethin'.

08:48.377 --> 08:51.278
So, anyway,
you're an intelligent man.

08:51.347 --> 08:52.905
Thank you.

08:52.982 --> 08:55.007
- You make a good living.
- Not bad.

08:55.084 --> 08:56.984
- You got a good life!
- Pretty good.

08:57.053 --> 08:59.920
Answer me one question. Why the hell
would you want to come up to...

08:59.989 --> 09:03.322
a plant-infested no-man's-land like this
and live like a barbarian for a week?

09:03.392 --> 09:06.555
You wouldn't understand.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.257
Try me.

09:09.332 --> 09:13.393
I have great memories of this country when
I was a kid and used to come up with my dad...

09:13.469 --> 09:16.768
and I want the boys to have
the same memories.

09:16.839 --> 09:21.367
Look around you! For God sakes,
this is beautiful country!

09:21.444 --> 09:25.210
- Take a good look.
- I'll tell you what I see when I look if you wanna know.

09:25.281 --> 09:28.079
Yeah, I'm... curious.

09:28.150 --> 09:31.711
I see the underdeveloped resources of
Northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

09:31.787 --> 09:36.747
I see a syndicated development consortium
exploiting over $1 billion in forest products.

09:36.826 --> 09:40.091
I see a paper mill, and, if the strategic
metals are there, a mining operation.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.563
A green belt between the condos on the
lake and a waste management facility...

09:43.633 --> 09:46.227
focusing on the newest rage
in toxic waste, medical refuge:

09:46.302 --> 09:51.103
infected bandages, body parts,
i.v. tubing, contaminated glassware,

09:51.173 --> 09:54.370
fluid, blood, low-grade radioactive
wastes, all safely contained,

09:54.443 --> 09:57.640
sunken in the lake
and sealed for centuries.

09:57.713 --> 10:00.273
Now, I ask you...
what do you see?

10:03.219 --> 10:05.119
I just see...

10:05.187 --> 10:08.054
uh, trees.

10:08.124 --> 10:11.355
- Well, no one ever accused you of having a grand vision.
- Nope.

10:11.427 --> 10:14.726
Maybe it's all for the best. While the
ambitious scramble for wealth and power,

10:14.797 --> 10:17.095
the Chet Ripleys of the world
are just able to lay back...

10:17.166 --> 10:20.624
and casually stroll
along life's path.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.933
- I mean that as a compliment.
- Oh, thanks.

10:23.005 --> 10:27.408
The rest of us are all probably gonna die
of heart attacks and strokes long before ya.

10:27.476 --> 10:29.910
I hope so!
Wouldn't that be great?

10:29.979 --> 10:32.948
Gee, just to see a bunch
of people drop that you hate.

10:33.015 --> 10:35.006
That would be something else,
I'm tellin' you.

10:35.084 --> 10:38.850
My goodness!
My goodness me!

10:38.921 --> 10:41.048
I'm gonna walk down
life's path right now.

10:41.123 --> 10:43.717
Ah, get the barbecue goin',
get some hot dogs on there.

10:43.793 --> 10:47.058
Wait a minute. No way.
Wait a hot-shit minute.

10:47.129 --> 10:49.927
Rule one: no relative of mine
is gonna eat hot dogs...

10:49.999 --> 10:53.025
as long as he's sharin'
my cabin. Katie!

10:53.102 --> 10:58.438
Do you sense the presence
of an alien life-form?

10:58.507 --> 11:03.843
- Now that you mention it, I do kinda sense somethin'.
- Yeah, I thought so.

11:05.948 --> 11:07.882
Ah, shit!

11:12.121 --> 11:15.420
Did I tell you what we did in the
euro-currency futures market last week?

11:15.491 --> 11:18.688
- Probably.
- I thought I mentioned how we picked up...

11:18.761 --> 11:21.958
a Deutsch marks contract, sat on it a
week, sold it, taking a 300 percent profit.

11:24.400 --> 11:28.734
Well, easy money
is money easily lost.

11:28.804 --> 11:32.399
I can't believe how dangerously
old-fashioned your thinking is.

11:32.475 --> 11:35.239
300 percent profit, huh?

11:35.311 --> 11:37.871
Sometimes it's 200 percent,
sometimes 100 percent.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.507
- Take the good with the bad.
- Huh.

11:40.583 --> 11:43.211
Yeah. Still that's pretty good.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.014
The point of the matter is,

11:45.087 --> 11:47.555
you should have
your piece too.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.921
Wow, hot!
Oh-ho!

11:49.992 --> 11:53.758
- How are those tails?
- Who's saying somethin' about my tails? They're killers.

11:53.829 --> 11:56.127
- They're $28 a pound.
- Twenty-eight? Oh, my God.

11:56.198 --> 11:59.497
Chet and I haven't had lobster
in an age, not since our anniversary.

11:59.568 --> 12:02.366
- Oh, my goodness!
- Jumping lobster!

12:02.438 --> 12:06.602
- Save that one. That'll be for me.
- I'll make sure of that.

12:06.675 --> 12:09.337
How 'bout the gourmet here?
You know what he wanted? Hot dogs!

12:09.412 --> 12:12.540
You know what they
make those things out of, Chet?

12:12.615 --> 12:14.583
Lips and assholes.

12:14.650 --> 12:18.711
Ha-ha-ha-ha. I guess I'm
old-fashioned. I like assholes.

12:18.788 --> 12:20.585
And I like lips!

12:20.656 --> 12:24.990
If I could market lips like those,
I'd make another million!

12:33.002 --> 12:36.563
Lobster turned out all
right, huh? If I do say so myself.

12:36.639 --> 12:40.905
I think we should go into town
tomorrow and pick up a ski boat.

12:40.976 --> 12:43.035
What do you say?
Sound good, guys?

12:43.112 --> 12:46.138
Uncle Roman will blow some coin
on a kick-ass drag boat.

12:46.215 --> 12:48.615
That's okay.
We're renting a pontoon boat.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.051
Pontoon boat. What the hell
you gonna do with a pontoon boat?

12:52.121 --> 12:56.057
- Retake Omaha Beach?
- No, not at all.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.719
A pontoon boat, you go out
and you cruise the lake.

12:58.794 --> 13:03.322
You swim from them, fish from them,
even bring the barbecue out.

13:03.399 --> 13:07.335
You have a great time.
You tour the lake in comfort.

13:07.403 --> 13:09.633
You guys wanna cruise
the lake in comfort...

13:09.705 --> 13:12.503
or would you rather skim the waves
with Uncle Roman in a jet boat?

13:12.575 --> 13:15.567
Jet boat!
Sorry, Dad.

13:15.644 --> 13:19.774
Atta boy, Benny!
All right, that's my man!

13:19.849 --> 13:21.817
Care to put it to a vote,
Chester?

13:21.884 --> 13:25.820
We don't need a vote. If you guys
want a jet boat, you get a jet boat.

13:25.888 --> 13:29.255
- Buck and I are getting a pontoon boat, right?
- Sorry, dad.

13:29.325 --> 13:31.486
Directly from the mouths
of babes, Chet.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.290
Are you gonna argue, or are you
gonna enjoy yourselves?

13:34.363 --> 13:36.490
Hey, I'm enjoying!
Chet's arguing.

13:36.565 --> 13:40.626
Hey, how 'bout if the kids go out and
catch fireflies? We could play cards.

13:40.703 --> 13:42.830
Cara? Mara?

13:42.905 --> 13:47.001
- You little dolls wanna go outside and catch fireflies?
- Honey, they don't like bugs.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.477
What do you mean?
All kids like bugs. They're cute.

13:50.546 --> 13:52.776
Especially fireflies.
Their butts light up.

13:59.121 --> 14:04.286
I am a killer Monopoly player.
Roman taught me. He's vicious.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.692
Buddy Reiser died.

14:06.762 --> 14:12.428
- Oh, no!
- The president of Energy Resources died in bed.

14:12.501 --> 14:15.800
- He was your mentor, wasn't he
- One of the men I admired.

14:15.871 --> 14:17.805
Hey, I'm tryin' to read!

14:17.873 --> 14:22.674
Sorry, I think I have
to tell you this story.

14:22.745 --> 14:25.543
A story that might
save your lives...

14:25.614 --> 14:28.981
- since we're up here in the North Woods.
- I know the heimlich maneuver.

14:30.219 --> 14:33.347
No, this is...

14:34.924 --> 14:37.449
a bear story.

14:39.028 --> 14:41.724
A true bear story.

14:43.499 --> 14:46.434
Connie and I honeymooned
at this very same lake.

14:46.502 --> 14:48.367
Big spender!

14:48.437 --> 14:52.066
- We stayed at my uncle's cabin.
- Uncle George?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.268
Yeah, that's right.

14:54.343 --> 14:56.777
One night we were
getting ready for bed...

14:56.845 --> 15:00.542
and we heard this terrible
noise out by the trash cans.

15:00.616 --> 15:02.413
You remember?

15:02.484 --> 15:04.418
And...

15:04.486 --> 15:08.946
I went downstairs to check
it out, looked out the window.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.751
And there...

15:13.829 --> 15:18.289
was the biggest, baddest bear
in the North Woods.

15:18.367 --> 15:22.997
- Sure, Dad.
- No, it's true. It's true!

15:23.072 --> 15:27.634
This bear
was over eight feet high.

15:29.545 --> 15:32.912
With big, white teeth.

15:32.982 --> 15:35.917
Fangs...

15:35.985 --> 15:38.954
stained pink...

15:39.021 --> 15:43.048
from whatever it killed
before it got to our cabin.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.457
It was frightening.

15:48.130 --> 15:49.722
Frightening.

15:51.033 --> 15:56.096
The paws on this thing
were immense,

15:56.171 --> 16:00.107
with big black claws,

16:00.175 --> 16:02.336
razor sharp...

16:02.411 --> 16:05.005
like Freddie Kruger.

16:08.183 --> 16:10.617
Only worse.
Worse, worse.

16:10.686 --> 16:15.020
This wasn't a movie. This was
happening now right in front of me.

16:15.090 --> 16:18.321
And all that separated me
from that bear...

16:18.394 --> 16:20.862
was a pane of glass!

16:20.929 --> 16:24.194
- Honey, maybe we shouldn't tell this story right now.
- Mom, it's fine.

16:24.266 --> 16:26.200
I'm thinking
about nightmares.

16:26.268 --> 16:29.203
No, no.
They have to hear this.

16:29.271 --> 16:34.504
Like I say... it might
save their life one day.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.101
Now...

16:37.179 --> 16:41.343
I saw that bear,
it saw me.

16:41.417 --> 16:45.080
And it was hungry!

16:45.154 --> 16:47.281
Hungry for blood!

16:47.356 --> 16:50.018
Human blood.

16:50.092 --> 16:54.620
You see... once a bear
gets a taste for blood,

16:55.764 --> 17:00.224
it craves it,
it needs it.

17:00.302 --> 17:03.897
It will do anything it can
to get it.

17:03.972 --> 17:08.136
That bear had become
a man-eater!

17:09.411 --> 17:13.244
Our eyes locked.
My heart was pumpin'.

17:13.315 --> 17:17.183
Pump, pump, pump, pump.

17:17.252 --> 17:18.844
Pump!

17:18.921 --> 17:20.912
I ran into the living room.

17:20.989 --> 17:23.856
I grabbed the shotgun
off the mantle.

17:23.925 --> 17:27.828
Turned around and there was
that bear right in the window.

17:29.298 --> 17:33.064
Its breath was foggin' up
the glass.

17:34.503 --> 17:36.437
And suddenly...

17:36.505 --> 17:41.238
it let out this God-awful roar.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.679
It started
smashin' in the walls.

17:46.749 --> 17:49.047
Then the pots and pans
started rattling.

17:49.118 --> 17:52.451
And the walls started shimmering
and the floorboards started lifting.

17:52.521 --> 17:56.252
I knew then that it was either
the bear or your mom and I.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.694
So I raised the rifle,
I took aim and I fired!

18:00.763 --> 18:02.856
You wasted her?

18:02.931 --> 18:06.628
Nah, Benny, Benny, Benny. A shotgun's
not gonna kill a monster bear like that!

18:06.702 --> 18:11.935
- What happened?
- The buckshot shaved the hair clean off the top of its head.

18:12.007 --> 18:15.306
It ran off.
We never saw it again.

18:15.377 --> 18:18.813
Oh, I hear from my uncle
every now and then.

18:18.881 --> 18:23.841
And he'd tell us about
the bald-headed killer bear...

18:23.919 --> 18:27.616
that was roaming
about the area.

18:27.689 --> 18:31.455
The bald-headed
killer bear...

18:31.527 --> 18:34.155
of Clare County.

18:34.229 --> 18:36.925
- Is she still around?
- Oh!

18:36.999 --> 18:42.096
- No, no, no. That bear's gone.
- She may be out there.

18:44.139 --> 18:46.972
Crazy, bloodthirsty as ever.

18:47.042 --> 18:52.173
So when you go to bed tonight,
if you hear a noise,

18:54.283 --> 18:56.251
whatever you do,

18:56.318 --> 18:59.412
don't look out the window.

18:59.488 --> 19:02.457
Because it might be
the bear!

19:04.359 --> 19:08.318
Jesus Christ! I'm half-drunk.
What are you tryin' to do?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.865
- Give me nightmares for a month?
- Come on!

19:10.933 --> 19:12.992
I can't believe you, Dad.
All right?

19:13.068 --> 19:15.002
Oh, Benny, honey!

19:15.070 --> 19:19.507
Gee, I'm 25 pounds overweight. I don't
need a blast to the ticker like that!

19:19.575 --> 19:21.543
I felt my plaque
start flowin' again!

19:21.610 --> 19:23.601
Really inappropriate, Chet.

19:23.679 --> 19:26.307
What?
It was a story!

19:26.381 --> 19:28.110
Come on!

19:28.183 --> 19:32.085
Oh, come on!
It was a kind of true story.

19:32.154 --> 19:36.022
Part of it happened. I just embellished
a bit, that's all. Come on, kids.

19:36.091 --> 19:39.993
Oh, what? What?
What is that look?

19:40.062 --> 19:44.294
So now I get the look.
I was just tryin' to have some fun.

19:44.366 --> 19:46.926
Oh, God!

19:47.002 --> 19:49.732
So I made the fangs
a little bigger. Geez!

20:01.283 --> 20:04.480
Look, it's a story
my dad told me,

20:04.553 --> 20:07.488
and I'm sure his dad told him,
and I'm tellin' you!

20:15.898 --> 20:17.832
Good evening.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.528
How's it goin'?

20:22.671 --> 20:25.731
Listen, girls,

20:25.807 --> 20:28.037
as your father,

20:28.110 --> 20:31.409
I feel it incumbent upon me
to set the record straight...

20:31.480 --> 20:34.779
on the validity of the tale which
Uncle Chet shared with us this evening.

20:34.850 --> 20:39.412
A terrifying story like that coming from
the mouth of a recognized authority figure...

20:39.488 --> 20:41.649
could be traumatizing
for kids like yourselves.

20:41.723 --> 20:44.351
I know because I had a similar
experience with my Uncle Roy...

20:44.426 --> 20:47.520
and a story he used to tell about
a family that went into the woods...

20:47.596 --> 20:50.793
and was attacked by a band
of escaped army psychiatric patients...

20:50.866 --> 20:56.532
who'd been subjected to violent, hellish,
torturous behavior modification experiments.

20:56.605 --> 21:00.200
It seems they escaped from
the metal boxes the army kept them in,

21:00.275 --> 21:04.644
found this family in the woods, fell
upon them, slaughtered them and ate them.

21:04.713 --> 21:09.343
That story gave me nightmares
not to be believed.

21:09.418 --> 21:13.354
I don't want Uncle Chet's bear story
to upset you in the same way.

21:13.422 --> 21:16.050
So I'm here to say that
there actually is no bear...

21:16.124 --> 21:20.857
and that all of what Uncle Chet was saying
was a yarn-spinnin' for our entertainment.

21:20.929 --> 21:25.093
And even if there were a bear out there,
I'm in the house to protect you.

21:25.167 --> 21:27.897
So, uh,

21:27.970 --> 21:31.030
no more thinkin' about bears,
all right?

21:31.106 --> 21:33.233
No more thinkin' about
unpleasant things.

21:33.308 --> 21:37.472
We're gonna close our eyes
and dream...

21:37.546 --> 21:40.777
about nice things.

21:40.849 --> 21:45.013
About cuddly, soft,
fluffy things.

21:46.421 --> 21:48.480
Okay?

21:48.557 --> 21:50.616
Super.

21:50.692 --> 21:53.991
Good night.
Sleep tight.

22:56.691 --> 22:59.285
Honey?

22:59.361 --> 23:02.990
Chet?
Where are you?

23:06.168 --> 23:10.332
Oh, God!
That's rotted. Oh!

23:11.840 --> 23:14.741
Hello. Jerry Asmuth, please.
Roman Craig.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.244
Yeah, I can hold,
but not for too long.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.247
I'm in God's country.
My signal's kinda weak.

23:31.927 --> 23:34.020
- Honey?
- Yes, Roman?

23:34.096 --> 23:37.361
Why is it Chet's kids
look at him like he's Zeus...

23:37.432 --> 23:41.528
and my kids look at me like I'm
a rack of yard tools at Sears?

23:41.603 --> 23:47.132
- I mean, why can't they connect with me?
- Well, honey,

23:47.209 --> 23:50.406
maybe if you spent less time at work
and a little more time with us...

23:50.479 --> 23:53.539
- things would be different.
- Put a cork in it, honey. Talkin' business.

23:53.615 --> 23:57.142
Jerry. Yeah, Roman.
How are ya?

23:57.219 --> 24:00.154
Listen, I'll save us a lot of trouble
and cut right to the chase.

24:00.222 --> 24:02.850
I got an unbelievable
investment opportunity for you.

24:02.924 --> 24:06.257
You got about three minutes
and 25 grand? Jerry?

24:06.328 --> 24:08.057
Did you hear what I said?

24:08.130 --> 24:10.928
Lost the signal here.
These cellular phones, they don't work.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.796
Maybe he hung up on you.

24:12.868 --> 24:16.099
Why would a minister hang up on me?
I've been to his church.

24:16.171 --> 24:18.765
Oh, yeah! Once!

24:21.009 --> 24:23.307
All right!

24:23.378 --> 24:25.437
How 'bout that, huh?

24:25.514 --> 24:28.745
We're gonna be scrapin' the bugs
off our teeth with this baby, Ben!

24:28.817 --> 24:33.379
That's too much boat.
It's just too much.

24:33.455 --> 24:37.585
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure. Are you hungry?

24:37.659 --> 24:41.095
Gimme four chili dogs
and two plain dogs, please.

24:41.163 --> 24:42.960
That's six hot dogs, Dad.

24:43.031 --> 24:46.592
It's for everybody, all right?
And I'm hungry.

24:46.668 --> 24:48.431
So?

24:48.503 --> 24:53.497
Oh, yeah. Do you mind if I walk
around for a while? Cruise the town?

24:53.575 --> 24:56.408
I can walk back
when I'm done.

24:56.478 --> 24:59.003
All right.
But you gotta promise me...

24:59.080 --> 25:01.548
- when you get back we're gonna spend some time together.
- Right.

25:01.616 --> 25:05.143
That's why we're up here. That's the
point of this trip, to be in the woods.

25:05.220 --> 25:09.179
The men, the guys, together. Rugged,
manly, all that stuff. The full nine yards.

25:09.257 --> 25:10.815
- Exactly.
- All right?

25:10.892 --> 25:12.985
Right.

25:13.061 --> 25:15.120
- Gimme a hug.
- What?

25:15.197 --> 25:17.495
- Gimme a hug, will ya? Come on.
- Dad?

25:17.566 --> 25:21.798
- I'm too old for hugs.
- Ooh, you're never too old for hugs.

25:21.870 --> 25:24.839
- Can I go now? Thank you very much.
- Go, go, go.

25:24.906 --> 25:29.673
If you meet any friends, bring 'em back.
We'll give 'em a ride in Suck My Wake.

25:36.084 --> 25:38.075
God! Great.

25:38.153 --> 25:42.180
You've got it in neutral!

25:42.257 --> 25:44.817
It's okay.

25:44.893 --> 25:47.726
It's in neutral.
You gotta put it...

26:03.812 --> 26:08.272
- Okay.
- I'll figure it out. Just gimme the skis.

26:08.350 --> 26:11.649
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You're a professional skier already.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.711
You don't need any notes?

26:13.788 --> 26:17.383
You don't need any help from somebody
who might know a little about skiing, huh?

26:17.459 --> 26:20.223
- We're gonna go over it one more time, okay?
- Fine.

26:20.295 --> 26:22.263
- Come on, this is important.
- Okay!

26:22.330 --> 26:25.299
What are we doing
sitting here?

26:25.367 --> 26:28.268
He's teaching the kid, givin' him
lessons. Wants Benny to be safe.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.032
Lean back.
Doesn't that feel better?

26:31.106 --> 26:34.735
There you go. Okay, we're leanin' back.
Now there's trouble.

26:34.809 --> 26:37.607
- What?
- There's some trouble.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.614
What are we gonna do?
Let go of the rope!

26:40.682 --> 26:43.344
How many times
have I told you?

26:43.418 --> 26:45.579
If you're in trouble,
let go of the rope.

26:45.654 --> 26:49.784
Remember, go loose when you fall.
Just go loose.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.587
What is he doing?

26:51.660 --> 26:54.458
- He's shaking.
- Kind of a new dance or something.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.929
- Fix your vest up.
- Thanks, Dad.

26:56.998 --> 26:58.795
Are we gonna ski?

26:58.867 --> 27:02.132
I can't tell ya... ye-te-te-te-te.
How important this is.

27:04.973 --> 27:07.771
Let's go! Ski or flee.

27:07.842 --> 27:12.802
- Honey, he's waving.
- Ah, he's going. All right.

27:16.685 --> 27:19.677
Whoa!

27:26.795 --> 27:28.820
Hey, Dad,
let go of the rope!

27:32.033 --> 27:34.194
Help me, for God's sake!

27:34.269 --> 27:36.169
Holy shit!

27:37.572 --> 27:38.971
Oh, no!

27:41.910 --> 27:44.879
- Wow!
- Whoa!

27:53.254 --> 27:54.619
You bastard!

27:54.689 --> 27:58.125
Whoa! Whoa!

27:58.193 --> 28:00.252
Whoa!

28:01.496 --> 28:03.123
You bastard, Roman!

28:03.198 --> 28:07.430
- What's he saying?
- You bastard!

28:07.502 --> 28:11.666
- What's he saying?
- Faster. Go faster.

28:14.876 --> 28:16.537
Hi!

28:16.611 --> 28:18.579
Roman, what the hell
are you doin'?

28:18.646 --> 28:21.171
I love to see him relaxing.

28:26.588 --> 28:29.056
I'm dead! I'm dead!
I'm dead! I'm dead!

28:29.124 --> 28:31.786
I'm dead!
I'm dying! I'm dying!

28:37.665 --> 28:41.567
I'm alive. I'm alive.
Thank you! Thank you!

28:43.638 --> 28:46.573
Ah, no!

29:35.857 --> 29:37.757
What are you doin'?

29:37.826 --> 29:40.226
What's it look
like I'm doin'?

29:40.295 --> 29:42.490
I am not taking any more
of Roman's crap.

29:42.564 --> 29:45.055
If you like him, you stay with him.
I'm through, I'm outta here.

29:45.133 --> 29:48.296
Wait a minute. What happened
that got you so crazy?

29:48.369 --> 29:51.429
- What happened? Come on! What happened?
- Yeah.

29:51.506 --> 29:54.771
How 'bout Roman draggin' me all over
that goddamn lake for starters, huh?

29:54.843 --> 29:58.836
- Not bad, huh? Have you seen my ass lately?
- No, not recently.

29:58.913 --> 30:03.179
- I'll be picking splinters out from now until the day I die!
- Honey, come on.

30:03.251 --> 30:05.913
You find that funny?
That was hysterical, wasn't it?

30:05.987 --> 30:08.581
It wasn't really funny,
but because I love you, it was.

30:08.656 --> 30:11.921
- Thanks a lot!
- What about the kids?

30:11.993 --> 30:15.326
What about his kids?
Let's talk about his kids.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.887
His kids, they're spooky,
all right?

30:17.966 --> 30:20.992
I'm waitin' for their heads
to rotate around and vomit pea soup.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.835
- I mean our kids.
- Our kids already do that.

30:24.906 --> 30:29.002
What about this father-son thing?
You're gonna leave, pack up?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.671
The guy's drivin' me crazy!

30:31.746 --> 30:36.115
You're a big man. And you're
a nice man. And you're above all this.

30:36.184 --> 30:39.347
- Oh, don't.
- Hey, you are.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.547
I know it to be true.

30:41.623 --> 30:43.557
Don't! Don't. Don't!

30:43.625 --> 30:45.889
Come on, I'm mad.
I'm, I'm mad.

30:47.428 --> 30:50.556
All right, all right.
What are you saying? I'm being silly?

30:50.632 --> 30:52.862
Crazy!
Stop.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.334
Why do you always do this
to me, you know?

30:55.403 --> 30:57.701
I'm crazy about you.
Kiss me.

30:57.772 --> 31:01.037
- Do you feel better?
- I do, and I'm sorry.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.839
I feel like a little kid.
I feel a lot better.

31:03.912 --> 31:07.040
Why did you do this?
Why now? I was ready to go!

31:07.115 --> 31:10.482
- Why, why, why?
I was almost in the car!

31:10.552 --> 31:14.010
Now I've got to spend a week
with Roman!

31:14.088 --> 31:17.148
Come on. You're gonna have fun
from now on, I promise you.

31:17.225 --> 31:20.524
Roman's making goat cheese pizza and
we'll take it to the lodge. Come on.

31:20.595 --> 31:24.156
He's makin' what?
What did you say?

31:24.232 --> 31:26.359
- Pizza?
- You didn't say pizza.

31:26.434 --> 31:28.493
- Big... man pizza.
- What are you hiding?

31:28.570 --> 31:32.097
- You don't have to hide from me! Tell me what it is.
- Pizza.

31:32.173 --> 31:36.701
You said a "goat" in there. Is he making
goat pizza? What is this? Come here.

31:39.113 --> 31:43.516
- Roman, I got a few things to gnaw over with ya.
- What's goin' on?

31:43.585 --> 31:47.681
- I found your youngsters inside the mine perimeter.
- What mine?

31:47.755 --> 31:50.451
There's an old mica mine
on the other side of the property.

31:50.525 --> 31:54.586
It's full of boreholes and sinkholes
and pits, caves, hollows.

31:54.662 --> 31:57.825
The war shut the facility down.
It's never been reopened.

31:57.899 --> 32:01.391
Anyway, the kids go there
and they yell down the hole...

32:01.469 --> 32:03.630
so they can hear
their voices echo.

32:03.705 --> 32:08.267
- I'm not gonna tell you what the teenagers do there.
- I'll bet.

32:08.343 --> 32:11.403
- Tell Ripley, too, huh?
- Done.

32:11.479 --> 32:13.538
Take care of 'em, Roman.

32:15.617 --> 32:19.348
We got a shot to see a female Elvis
impersonator over in White Water...

32:19.420 --> 32:22.753
and you want to wish happy birthday
to a guy you never even met?

32:22.824 --> 32:24.883
You want to go to White Water,
go to White Water.

32:24.959 --> 32:28.190
As for me, I find it more interesting
to pay my respects...

32:28.262 --> 32:31.561
to a man who's had the courage
to live on this earth 109 years.

32:31.633 --> 32:34.932
He's the oldest living man
in Canada, kids. Isn't that something?

32:35.003 --> 32:39.030
Personally, I'd rather see
a 46-inch bust singing "burnin' love."

32:43.378 --> 32:45.539
- Hey, Wally!
- How you doin'?

32:45.613 --> 32:49.777
How 'bout a nice club soda,
please? I'm drivin' tonight.

32:49.851 --> 32:54.185
Nice outfit!
You're Mr. Coordinated tonight, huh?

32:54.255 --> 32:56.951
- Well...
- Quite the look on you.

32:57.025 --> 33:01.428
Well, the pants are ridin'
up the butt somethin' fierce...

33:01.496 --> 33:03.589
but I'll get by.

33:03.665 --> 33:08.261
- Wally, what's the bear dump situation like?
- We got a good one.

33:08.336 --> 33:10.827
Good evening, sir.
Happy birthday.

33:10.905 --> 33:13.703
He must be hard of hearing.
Try again.

33:13.775 --> 33:17.734
Sprechen sie Deutsch?
Do you speak English?

33:17.812 --> 33:20.804
Our sincerest congratulations, sir.

33:20.882 --> 33:23.783
You wishing Mr. Tompkins
a happy birthday?

33:23.851 --> 33:26.376
About a hundred times.
I don't think the guy can hear us.

33:26.454 --> 33:30.515
How about a nice group photo? Give me
your camera. Everybody get in there.

33:30.591 --> 33:33.151
- What do I do, push the red button?
- Just the red button, Dad.

33:33.227 --> 33:34.888
- How do you focus?
- You don't focus.

33:34.962 --> 33:37.522
- You don't have to focus?
- Just push the red button.

33:37.598 --> 33:42.501
I don't like them youngsters climbing around
Mr. Tompkins. He's ain't no jungle gym.

33:42.570 --> 33:45.869
Girls, why don't you kiss
Mr. Tompkins on the cheek?

33:45.940 --> 33:48.170
- A nice kiss on the cheek.
- No.

33:48.242 --> 33:52.645
- What old man wouldn't like a little girl kissin' him?
- A dead one.

33:52.714 --> 33:55.683
- Huh?
- Bill died in the car on the way over here.

33:55.750 --> 33:58.344
Jesus, Dad!

33:58.419 --> 34:02.879
Go wash, go wash!
In the bathroom.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.619
- How could you do that?
- I didn't do that. He did it.

34:05.693 --> 34:08.092
You're disgusting.
Kids?

34:26.481 --> 34:30.315
That was a real good shot.
That was really, really good.

34:44.931 --> 34:46.592
What the hell...

34:52.172 --> 34:55.266
Hey, you gave her a world-class
goose with the pool cue, Buck.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.139
She's so cute!

34:57.211 --> 35:00.374
Violent, but... yeah, cute.

35:00.448 --> 35:02.712
You got chalk right there.

35:02.784 --> 35:06.481
- Look, I'll be back in a couple of minutes, okay?
- What about the bear dump?

35:12.460 --> 35:16.658
Hey, it's crowded.
This is great.

35:16.731 --> 35:20.292
- Yeah, Dad.
- See, a lot of people are hip to this.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.064
Oh, yeah.
Hey!

35:23.137 --> 35:27.437
All right!
Look at those bears!

35:27.508 --> 35:30.272
Huh?
Are you scared or what?

35:30.344 --> 35:33.939
- Look at the bears!
- They're great, Dad.

35:34.015 --> 35:38.349
"They're great, Dad." I've got
a great idea. You're gonna see bears.

35:38.419 --> 35:40.819
- Dad.
- Shh, shh, shh.

35:42.423 --> 35:45.221
Here you go.

35:45.293 --> 35:47.090
Nice Zagnut.

35:47.161 --> 35:49.561
Yeah!

35:49.630 --> 35:51.996
Come on.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.863
Come on.
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

35:53.935 --> 35:56.836
Come on! More!

35:56.904 --> 35:59.634
Come on.
Here's some more.

36:03.010 --> 36:05.672
Geez.
Boy, he likes those.

36:05.746 --> 36:09.944
Now we'll get some action.
Whoa. Big head on him.

36:10.017 --> 36:11.848
Whoo boy!

36:11.919 --> 36:15.377
Easy, easy,
easy there! Easy!

36:15.456 --> 36:17.481
Hey, watch the paint job.

36:17.558 --> 36:19.719
Hey, shoo!

36:19.794 --> 36:22.786
Look at the size
of those teeth. Whoo!

36:24.599 --> 36:26.533
Hey, shoo!
Go on!

36:26.601 --> 36:31.038
- Dad, I wouldn't do that.
- You may be right. Yeah, he's lookin' at us.

36:31.105 --> 36:35.166
He's not finished, that's it.
When he finishes, he'll go.

36:35.243 --> 36:38.007
He's a pretty big bear.

36:38.079 --> 36:39.979
Very big.

36:40.047 --> 36:42.311
Just let him eat his candy bar.

36:42.383 --> 36:45.682
Shoo, shoo, shoo.
Hi.

36:45.753 --> 36:48.688
How you doin'?

36:48.756 --> 36:51.054
Whoo.

36:54.395 --> 36:57.558
Ah, geez. All right,
all right, all right.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.965
Okay. Um,
let me rethink this.

37:01.035 --> 37:03.902
Hey!
What the hell?

37:13.848 --> 37:16.282
All right, uh...

37:16.350 --> 37:20.446
- I've... I've told you I loved ya, right?
- Yeah.

37:20.521 --> 37:22.751
Good, good.

37:22.823 --> 37:26.315
What do you say
we call it a night, huh?

37:26.394 --> 37:28.294
Holy geez!

37:28.362 --> 37:32.059
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
We started something.

37:33.467 --> 37:35.196
Let's call it an evening.

37:35.269 --> 37:37.533
- Yeah, I'm tired.
- Me too, me too.

37:37.605 --> 37:40.073
Yeah, let's just go.

37:40.141 --> 37:44.578
That didn't scare him.

37:44.645 --> 37:48.103
I'm, uh, I'm gonna move now.

37:48.182 --> 37:50.377
I'm moving now!

37:50.451 --> 37:53.284
All right,
I'll just drive out.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.982
He'll jump right off, son.
Don't you worry.

37:57.725 --> 38:01.991
Dad, isn't it illegal to drive
with a bear on your hood?

38:02.063 --> 38:05.931
I don't know in this state, son.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.438
Yogi and Booboo in the flesh. I wish the hell
Ranger Smith'd get out here and get us home.

38:11.505 --> 38:14.997
Hey, easy on the roof, pal.

38:15.076 --> 38:18.603
We should've brought
Uncle Roman's car.

38:23.084 --> 38:25.314
Knock, knock.

38:25.386 --> 38:29.152
You, uh... didn't give me
a chance to apologize.

38:35.329 --> 38:39.163
- Can I sit down?
- I don't own the park.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.167
Oh.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.971
Look, um...

38:46.040 --> 38:48.304
- I just got here. I'm from...
- Chicago.

38:48.376 --> 38:50.037
How'd you know?

38:50.111 --> 38:53.012
It's no big trick, dude.
Live all your life in this town,

38:53.080 --> 38:56.243
it becomes
like second nature.

38:56.317 --> 38:58.842
Guess this means that...
I met my first local.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.978
You don't know
how local I am!

39:03.691 --> 39:05.716
You know...

39:07.595 --> 39:12.328
it's, ah...
it's a really beautiful town.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.459
- I mean...
- It's a hole in the earth.

39:16.470 --> 39:18.734
Why don't you just save
your breath?

39:18.806 --> 39:22.003
I'm not a tourist attraction.

39:24.745 --> 39:26.713
What did I do?

39:35.756 --> 39:39.749
- Hey, Dad.
- How you doin', handsome?

39:39.827 --> 39:42.625
What are you doin'
down here?

39:42.696 --> 39:46.257
Gettin' a breath
of night air.

39:46.333 --> 39:51.600
Hey, you, uh... wanna take
a spin in the rowboat?

39:51.672 --> 39:53.867
- Right now?
- Yeah, what the hell?

39:53.941 --> 39:56.171
- In the dark?
- We'll check out some stars.

39:56.243 --> 39:59.269
- I don't know, Dad.
- Come on. Let's do somethin'.

39:59.346 --> 40:01.644
Long as we're here.
Let's go. Come on.

40:01.715 --> 40:04.980
- Come on! I'll let you row!
- Oh, great.

40:05.052 --> 40:07.020
- It'll be fun.
- Yeah.

40:08.889 --> 40:12.689
Boy, what a beautiful sky!

40:12.760 --> 40:15.456
Smell that air, hmm?
Isn't that somethin'?

40:15.529 --> 40:18.896
That's the old city in your lungs.

40:18.966 --> 40:21.730
Get rid of that. You're getting
the good air in there now.

40:21.802 --> 40:25.738
You know, one day you're gonna
be coming up here with your kids.

40:25.806 --> 40:28.070
Yeah. Maybe.

40:28.142 --> 40:30.133
I want to give you something.

40:30.211 --> 40:34.204
Dad, you're not gonna... kiss me
in the boat under the moon, are you?

40:34.281 --> 40:36.841
I'm not gonna kiss ya.

40:36.917 --> 40:40.751
- I'm gonna give you my ring.
- Why?

40:40.821 --> 40:45.690
Why? Because... my father gave it
to me, and now I'm giving it to you.

40:45.759 --> 40:48.125
You're grown up now.
You deserve it.

40:48.195 --> 40:51.221
So, like...

40:51.298 --> 40:55.257
you and I comin' up to the woods
is like your father bringing you here.

40:55.336 --> 40:57.896
Yeah, I guess so.

40:57.972 --> 41:01.772
Yeah. I understand.
Thanks for the ring.

41:58.899 --> 42:01.231
How you doin'...
Cammie?

42:03.170 --> 42:05.365
Can I help you?

42:05.439 --> 42:07.964
I don't know.
What's the house specialty?

42:08.042 --> 42:11.136
Where am I supposed
to put the tray?

42:11.212 --> 42:14.113
Well, from the way you spoke
to me last night,

42:14.181 --> 42:16.706
I'm sure you can think
of a hundred good places.

42:16.784 --> 42:19.719
I'm sorry about that.
I was in a bad mood, okay?

42:19.787 --> 42:23.052
Don't worry about it. It happens
to me. It's no big deal.

42:23.123 --> 42:26.889
But that doesn't mean I didn't mean what
I said. For the most part, it's true.

42:26.961 --> 42:30.362
You don't even know me.
How can you say that's true of me?

42:30.431 --> 42:33.093
It's a safe assumption.

42:33.167 --> 42:35.533
Excuse me. Can we
get some service over here?

42:35.603 --> 42:38.367
I'll be right there.
I gotta go. Okay?

42:38.439 --> 42:41.499
- What time do you finish work?
- 8:00.

42:41.575 --> 42:45.204
8:00? And where are you
gonna be after work...

42:45.279 --> 42:47.372
- at 8:00?
- I'll be around.

42:47.448 --> 42:50.042
Can I see you?

42:50.117 --> 42:53.518
Yeah...
if you can find me.

43:20.281 --> 43:23.409
I gotcha!
I gotcha!

43:30.658 --> 43:34.560
Come on, Chet.
Better ride up here.

43:34.628 --> 43:37.096
If you trail behind,
the Indians'll get ya.

43:37.164 --> 43:40.531
- Come on, honey.
- Uncle Roman, wait for Dad.

43:40.601 --> 43:43.729
Dad, hurry up.

43:43.804 --> 43:47.501
Watch out
for those Wisconsin rattlers.

43:47.574 --> 43:51.601
- Honey, come on!
- Whoa. Whoa.

43:51.679 --> 43:53.909
Wait up, you guys.

43:53.981 --> 43:57.178
Hey, come on.
Whoa! Hey, ow!

43:57.251 --> 44:02.086
Easy. All right.
Okay, have it your way.

44:02.156 --> 44:05.421
I'll just get off.

44:05.492 --> 44:08.154
Here we go.
You all right?

44:08.228 --> 44:10.219
Okay, let's go.
We'll walk it.

44:10.297 --> 44:13.198
Come on. Come on!
Let's...

44:13.267 --> 44:15.292
Hey.

44:15.369 --> 44:19.305
Easy, easy. Let's just
walk back to the stable.

44:19.373 --> 44:21.671
All right?
I'm walkin', you're walkin'.

44:21.742 --> 44:24.609
Let's have a nice easy walk.
Come on.

44:26.413 --> 44:30.645
All right. All right. That was
your last chance. That's it.

44:30.718 --> 44:33.312
Have it your way.

44:33.387 --> 44:37.824
I don't wanna do this, but you
forced me to. Remember that.

44:39.193 --> 44:42.094
I hate to do this to ya.

44:42.162 --> 44:44.562
Normally, I'm not
a mean person, but I'm a...

44:44.631 --> 44:49.330
Hey! Come back here!
Son of a bitch!

44:49.403 --> 44:54.306
That baby I was ridin' was a
purebred. Purebred mule horse.

44:54.375 --> 44:57.401
You rode it like it was.

44:57.478 --> 45:02.108
- That baby was bred for packin'.
- Honey, you're a stud. You look great on that horse.

45:02.182 --> 45:04.480
- Here he comes.
- Where's our pal? Where is he?

45:04.551 --> 45:07.247
Oh, my gosh! Hi, honey.

45:07.321 --> 45:10.415
He lost his mount.
How ya doin', trooper?

45:10.491 --> 45:13.927
Where's that ball-slappin' nag
you were ridin'?

45:13.994 --> 45:16.724
- He looks a little worse for wear, doesn't he?
- You okay, Dad?

45:16.797 --> 45:19.698
- I'm okay.
- Did that horse buck you off?

45:19.767 --> 45:23.794
What happened? You got hungry
and had to eat the nag, huh?

45:23.871 --> 45:26.396
- Let's go home. I think I'll go home.
- You go home?

45:26.473 --> 45:30.204
- Home? We've got a whole day of activities planned.
- A little nap.

45:30.277 --> 45:32.837
- No, come on!
- Oh, yeah.

45:32.913 --> 45:35.939
- I'm fine. A little nap.
- Hey!

46:05.979 --> 46:09.005
Yeah, I know muskie's a big deal
to fish in these waters,

46:09.082 --> 46:11.209
but you come with me up to the Norfolk
Canyon off the coast of Virginia,

46:11.285 --> 46:14.550
I'll strap you into a fishing chair and
let you hook into a 1,000 pound blue marlin.

46:14.621 --> 46:18.250
Buddy, you're gonna know what fishing's
all about with a capital "f."

46:18.325 --> 46:22.591
Excuse my brother-in-law. He gets a couple
cocktails, he becomes an expert on everything.

46:22.663 --> 46:24.756
I don't need cocktails for that.
Was that a shot?

46:24.832 --> 46:27.392
- No, that was the truth.
- That was a shot!

46:27.468 --> 46:28.833
That was a shot.

46:28.902 --> 46:31.370
Speaking of shots,
set us up.

46:31.438 --> 46:33.668
This guy's a riot.

46:33.740 --> 46:35.833
- Isn't he, though?
- Everybody loves him.

46:35.909 --> 46:37.774
Oh, yeah, yeah.

46:37.845 --> 46:40.643
Herm, you make a lot
of tips on this job?

46:40.714 --> 46:43.478
- I do all right.
- Who's handling your investments?

46:43.550 --> 46:46.018
My wife's got
some egg money put aside.

46:46.086 --> 46:48.680
But she's a real bear.
Won't give it up to me.

46:48.755 --> 46:51.519
Yeah. Well, I'll take her
phone number. I'll change that.

46:51.592 --> 46:54.459
- That's what I do for a living. Investments is what I do!
- How ya doin'?

46:54.528 --> 46:58.658
Well-well-well, it-it-it-it,
it ain't, it ain't,

46:58.732 --> 47:00.723
It ain't r-r-rainin'.

47:00.801 --> 47:04.032
It ain't r-r-rainin'
so-so that-that's good.

47:04.104 --> 47:05.537
Yeah, I guess so.

47:05.606 --> 47:09.167
- You fellows met Reg?
- I don't think so. How ya doin'?

47:09.243 --> 47:12.007
Roman Craig.
Pleased to meet you.

47:12.079 --> 47:17.381
- Chet Ripley. How do you do?
- Quite a hairdo you got goin'.

47:17.451 --> 47:20.545
- That a neo-skunk thing or...
- Roman, what are you doing?

47:20.621 --> 47:23.055
- He's got the hair!
- You don't have to say anything.

47:23.123 --> 47:26.490
His hair turned white
'cause lightning hit him.

47:26.560 --> 47:30.860
He's been struck by lightning,
how many times is it, Reg?

47:30.931 --> 47:35.800
- S-s-s-s-s-s... six.
- Six times!

47:35.869 --> 47:41.136
S-s-s-s six-six-six-six
sixty-sixty-six times...

47:41.208 --> 47:44.837
in th-th-th-th,
in th-th-th-th-th-th,

47:44.912 --> 47:46.846
in the head!

47:46.914 --> 47:49.474
Sixty-six times!

47:51.051 --> 47:54.020
God!
That's gotta hurt!

47:54.087 --> 47:58.421
You'll never meet a guy more tuned in
to the barometric pressure than Reg is.

47:58.492 --> 48:02.258
You see him runnin' like hell
for home, you head for cover.

48:02.329 --> 48:04.490
Right, Reg?

48:04.565 --> 48:07.557
You pay for the drinks. I gotta go
to the john. I'll be right back.

48:07.634 --> 48:12.571
- Introduce Mr. Thick Dick to Mr. Urinal Cake.
- Roman, do you have to be...

48:12.639 --> 48:17.076
What I really want to say
is... thank you.

48:17.144 --> 48:21.012
This is very important to Roman
and me. I miss you, Connie.

48:21.081 --> 48:23.379
Oh, honey.

48:26.420 --> 48:29.514
It's so lonely being wealthy.

48:29.590 --> 48:31.683
I wouldn't know
about that.

48:31.758 --> 48:36.320
No, no! I mean it, honey!
I mean it. It is lonely.

48:36.396 --> 48:40.992
He works terrible hours.
Travels.

48:41.068 --> 48:44.799
There'll be times we'll go a month
without going to bed together.

48:44.871 --> 48:47.271
Really? A month?
That long?

48:47.341 --> 48:50.674
Mm-hmm. Sometimes I think
the only way i'll get any pleasure...

48:50.744 --> 48:53.372
is by leaning against the washer
during the spin cycle.

48:53.447 --> 48:56.382
Does that really work?

48:56.450 --> 48:58.577
Have you ever seen
whiter whites?

49:04.491 --> 49:08.723
- When do you go back to Chicago?
- Um, three days.

49:10.931 --> 49:15.129
You know, I've never had a boyfriend
for longer than two weeks.

49:15.202 --> 49:17.636
Get outta here.

49:17.704 --> 49:20.229
- That's why I was such a bitch to you that first night.
- No, you weren't a bitch.

49:20.307 --> 49:24.744
- Yes, yes, I was!
- It's no big deal. Don't worry about it.

49:24.811 --> 49:27.746
That's why I don't understand
what I'm doing here with you.

49:29.950 --> 49:33.386
Look, I've never even had
a girlfriend.

49:33.453 --> 49:35.921
I've dated girls,
but, you know,

49:35.989 --> 49:38.583
I never had one
I'd call my girlfriend.

49:38.659 --> 49:42.095
- What would you call me?
- Officially?

49:46.099 --> 49:48.329
Ahem.
Girlfriend?

49:48.402 --> 49:51.269
And you're leaving
in three days.

49:51.338 --> 49:55.274
- See what I mean?
- Yeah.

49:55.342 --> 49:58.038
- Well?
- Well what?

50:18.765 --> 50:21.893
- What, what, what, what?
- It touched me!

50:21.968 --> 50:25.631
- It's been touching you for 12 years! You never freaked!
- Not you!

50:25.706 --> 50:28.539
- A thing!
- What thing?

50:28.608 --> 50:32.135
What's goin' on? Jesus!
What is it? What is it?

50:32.212 --> 50:34.544
That thing!

50:36.116 --> 50:41.247
- It's... just a little sparrow.
- Roman, it's got ears!

50:46.359 --> 50:49.556
Jesus Marie! It's a tiny flying mouse,
not a grizzly bear.

50:49.629 --> 50:51.859
I am not going back in there
until you get it out.

50:51.932 --> 50:54.332
- We'll get it out. Chet?
- What?

50:54.401 --> 50:57.996
Go get a shovel. Go in there
and get that radar-guided vermin.

50:58.071 --> 51:01.234
- Yeah.
- Why me?

51:01.308 --> 51:03.503
It's your cabin.
We didn't order one with bats.

51:03.577 --> 51:06.045
- You stay here too, you know.
- You're the host.

51:06.113 --> 51:09.605
- Stop fighting and go kill it.
- I don't think we have to kill it.

51:09.683 --> 51:11.617
- Kill it!
- No, it didn't do anything.

51:11.685 --> 51:13.243
It attacked me.

51:14.955 --> 51:17.287
Okay, he's wimpin' out.
I'll have to take care of it.

51:17.357 --> 51:21.453
I am not wimping. I am just thinking.
There's a big difference.

51:21.528 --> 51:23.962
You want me to take care of the thing,
I'll take care of the thing.

51:24.030 --> 51:26.863
I was just wondering who was
gonna do it. I'll do it.

51:26.933 --> 51:29.060
Like to get some sleep.
That's what I'd like to do.

51:29.136 --> 51:32.833
Afraid of a little bat.
Oh!

51:39.780 --> 51:42.544
- So?
- It buzzed me.

51:42.616 --> 51:46.985
We need a plan. It's bigger than
I thought. It's about a two-pounder.

51:47.053 --> 51:49.419
- Two-pounder?
- Yeah, big wings.

51:49.489 --> 51:52.287
It's got the teeth.
Terrible. It's frightening.

51:52.359 --> 51:56.261
I think we have to...
we have to do something.

51:56.329 --> 51:59.821
What we need, Roman, big plan.
That's what we need.

52:08.208 --> 52:11.041
We'll have this little baby
squealing mayday by midnight.

52:11.111 --> 52:13.841
Let's split up.

52:19.186 --> 52:21.177
- Do you see him?
- He's hiding.

52:21.254 --> 52:22.687
- I know that.
- Turn out the lights.

52:22.756 --> 52:25.691
- Why?
- He's nocturnal. He'll think it's daytime like this.

52:25.759 --> 52:27.693
Good point.

52:30.764 --> 52:35.792
- Now we got him. - Come on,
you little sonar-guided rodent.

52:35.869 --> 52:41.000
- Connie, bats carry rabies, don't they?
- Among other things.

52:41.074 --> 52:45.170
- I'm gonna call him now.
- Okay, just be still.

52:48.248 --> 52:50.716
- Are you kissing him or are you calling him?
- No, I'm calling him down.

52:50.784 --> 52:53.810
That's just the sound they make.
The high-pitched squeal.

52:59.926 --> 53:01.860
Right there, Dad.
Look up!

53:08.368 --> 53:10.029
I got him!

53:13.139 --> 53:15.471
Think fast!

53:15.542 --> 53:17.840
Get the light on him.
Get the light on him.

53:17.911 --> 53:22.041
Dad, keep your eye on the bat.

53:22.115 --> 53:24.709
Look at that thing move!

53:27.354 --> 53:31.415
Christ almighty!
Oh, geez, my head!

53:31.491 --> 53:34.221
Where is he? He's in
the rafters. He's refueling!

53:34.294 --> 53:38.094
- Where are you?
- Right here!

53:38.164 --> 53:40.359
- He's on my face!
- Hold still!

53:44.304 --> 53:46.204
We got it!

53:46.273 --> 53:49.401
- We got it!
- Oh, the pain.

53:49.476 --> 53:52.707
Ooh, that had to hurt.

53:52.779 --> 53:55.407
What a fighter.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.679
Boy, he was
something! I salute him!

54:00.287 --> 54:03.723
But...
we gotta get some sleep.

54:03.790 --> 54:05.815
Ooh!

54:14.434 --> 54:16.925
Hey.
Glad to see ya.

54:17.003 --> 54:19.995
- Yeah. What time do you get off work tonight?
- 8:00.

54:20.073 --> 54:23.042
- Great. I'll meet you at 9:00?
- Okay. Where?

54:23.109 --> 54:25.304
I don't know.
You're the one that lives here.

54:25.378 --> 54:28.575
- Um, the bait shop?
- Sure.

54:28.648 --> 54:31.481
I'll buy you some worms.

54:31.551 --> 54:34.452
- You won't ditch me?
- Wait a second.

54:34.521 --> 54:39.356
- Why would I ditch you?
- I don't know. Just waiting for it to happen.

54:39.426 --> 54:41.860
If I ditch you,
you have my permission...

54:41.928 --> 54:44.829
never to speak to me
as long as we both shall live.

54:44.898 --> 54:47.526
- Promise?
- Promise.

54:53.840 --> 54:56.172
I gotta go.

54:56.242 --> 54:58.472
- See ya later.
- Bye.

55:01.414 --> 55:01.481
- Yeah, that should do it.
- That's a good idea.

55:01.516 --> 55:04.678
- Yeah, that should do it.
- That's a good idea.

55:04.751 --> 55:09.017
I'll have the Royal Canadian
mounted beef barley soup.

55:09.089 --> 55:12.547
- Ooh, yeah.
- Then that bucket of salad.

55:12.625 --> 55:14.388
- I'll split that with you. Yeah.
- You will?

55:14.461 --> 55:18.727
Do that. That would help.
And then, I guess, the medley of perch.

55:18.798 --> 55:20.959
That's my favorite.

55:21.034 --> 55:22.626
- Okay.
- Miss?

55:22.702 --> 55:25.296
What's the old ninety-sixer?

55:25.372 --> 55:29.172
That's our world-famous
Paul Bunyan's blue ox steak.

55:29.242 --> 55:32.507
It is a 96 ounce
prime aged beef steak.

55:32.579 --> 55:36.811
And if you or any member of your party
orders the old ninety-sixer and finishes,

55:36.883 --> 55:38.908
everybody eats for free.

55:38.985 --> 55:41.044
- Not bad, huh?
- Wanna go for it, girls?

55:41.121 --> 55:44.113
- Oh, Roman!
- How about you, Chet?

55:44.190 --> 55:47.921
- People seem to like that.
- I'll try it. What the heck!

55:47.994 --> 55:53.796
- Seriously, though, has anybody ever eaten one?
- Oh, no, not in my lifetime.

56:15.922 --> 56:17.412
Bon appetit.

56:17.490 --> 56:19.515
Oh, good God!

56:20.860 --> 56:24.125
- Look at that.
- Check it out.

57:01.534 --> 57:04.731
How is he?

57:04.804 --> 57:10.367
Ooh. That's good. Processing
very nicely. All right, continue.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.520
- All right.
- I did it.

57:35.235 --> 57:38.363
- I think that just about does it.
- He's not done yet.

57:38.438 --> 57:40.702
He may take a little while
with that last bite,

57:40.773 --> 57:43.037
- but it'll go down.
- That ain't the last bite.

57:43.109 --> 57:47.170
Sure it is. There's nothin'
on that plate but gristle and fat.

57:48.781 --> 57:51.272
- Oh, God, no.
- No problem.

57:51.351 --> 57:53.842
If I can get
a dessert down him,

57:53.920 --> 57:57.083
could you throw in a couple
Paul Bunyan hats for the kids?

58:02.095 --> 58:04.029
Mind if I go now?

58:04.097 --> 58:07.066
They'll be tellin'
their grandkids about this.

58:07.133 --> 58:11.433
- Okay, but don't be too late.
- Where's he goin'?

58:11.504 --> 58:15.702
That Jimbo's not a bad guy. I just had
a word with him. Here's the kicker.

58:51.411 --> 58:53.379
Shit!

59:11.097 --> 59:13.930
- Oh, my God!
- Geez!

59:14.000 --> 59:17.492
Look at the size
of the maggots on that meat!

59:20.139 --> 59:23.700
- Oh, honey!
- Dad!

59:30.617 --> 59:32.551
Oh, my God!

59:34.320 --> 59:37.187
Let's go, everybody.
Move it out. It's 5:00 a.m.

59:37.257 --> 59:40.055
Fishin' boat shovin' off
in 15 minutes.

59:43.129 --> 59:45.188
These are the biggest
worms I've ever encountered.

59:45.265 --> 59:48.894
- They're not worms. They're leeches.
- I am not touching leeches, Dad.

59:48.968 --> 59:52.529
- Cut it out. They don't bite.
- No, they suck blood.

59:52.605 --> 59:56.336
- Ow! Would you watch the hook? Where's the flashlight?
- I don't know.

59:56.409 --> 59:59.105
Right behind you.
You owe me big for this one.

59:59.178 --> 01:00:01.544
Ho!

01:00:01.614 --> 01:00:05.209
Very funny, very funny.
Gimme a leech, will ya?

01:00:05.285 --> 01:00:08.220
- Has everybody got their leech?
- Yeah.

01:00:08.288 --> 01:00:10.722
On the count of three,
insert your hook. Ready?

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:13.953
One, two, three.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.393
Yech!

01:00:28.441 --> 01:00:32.537
Aah!

01:00:45.591 --> 01:00:47.855
May I speak with Cammie, please?

01:00:47.927 --> 01:00:50.521
Yeah, hold on just a minute.
Cammie, phone.

01:00:52.332 --> 01:00:55.324
Cammie's busy waitin' on cars.
May I take a message?

01:00:57.603 --> 01:01:00.299
All right. Please tell her
that Buck called.

01:01:00.373 --> 01:01:03.103
Okay, fine, Buck.
Good-bye.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:18.622
- Now what are you up to?
- What does it look like I'm up to?

01:01:18.691 --> 01:01:22.127
- It looks like you're wankin' your crank.
- I'm trying to build a fire.

01:01:22.195 --> 01:01:25.687
You might as well pour ice cubes in there.
You'll never get a fire goin' that way.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.030
You don't crumple a newspaper.
You twist it. Twist it.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:32.071
Lengthwise to simulate kindling.
That's the way you get it goin'.

01:01:33.306 --> 01:01:35.797
Maybe, Roman,
just maybe...

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:37.672
I'm trying to heat up
the flue.

01:01:37.744 --> 01:01:40.372
Ah, he's heating the flue.

01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:43.142
Meanwhile the human beings
in the room are freezing to death.

01:01:43.216 --> 01:01:47.915
- I'm really not cold. Not at all.
- Thank you for sharing that.

01:01:47.987 --> 01:01:51.684
I'm so sorry, Roman.
Forgive me.

01:01:51.758 --> 01:01:55.694
Why don't you come over here and show me
how to do it? You talk a great game.

01:01:55.762 --> 01:01:58.856
Come over. Let's see a little action.
After all, you know everything.

01:01:58.931 --> 01:02:02.025
You know exactly what to do
at any given moment.

01:02:02.101 --> 01:02:06.902
Katie, you were right. We should have gone
to Europe. Or maybe Haiti, or Antarctica.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:09.567
Or the Dead Sea.
Would've had a lot more fun!

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:12.202
Is that a fact?

01:02:12.278 --> 01:02:16.772
Nobody forced you
to come up here, buddy boy.

01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:20.114
As a matter of fact, I don't remember
anybody inviting you up here.

01:02:20.186 --> 01:02:22.177
Do you remember
inviting him?

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:26.451
I sure as hell don't.

01:02:26.526 --> 01:02:29.256
And what exactly is that
statement supposed to mean?

01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:32.729
- Figure it out for yourself.
- No, you specify, clarify it for me.

01:02:32.799 --> 01:02:35.893
All right? As a common courtesy,
if you don't mind.

01:02:35.968 --> 01:02:39.904
- You know what he means.
- I think they're trying to say that we're not welcome.

01:02:39.972 --> 01:02:44.636
Oh-ho! What did I hear?
We've got a bingo!

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:47.543
You did figure it out,
Kate.

01:02:47.613 --> 01:02:51.606
So, now it's all starting to ooze out.
It's very interesting, isn't it?

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:53.914
Yeah, very.

01:02:53.986 --> 01:02:57.615
Especially since we threw aside our plans.
We had a great European vacation planned.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:01.091
Threw aside our plans
to come up here...

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.856
to show these dead asses how to start
to learn to have a good time.

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:06.763
Thanks for ruining
my vacation, Ripley.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.431
What was that?

01:03:09.502 --> 01:03:12.232
Ruining your vacation?
Is that what you said?

01:03:12.305 --> 01:03:14.796
Oh, come on!

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:17.672
I don't believe
I heard you say that.

01:03:17.743 --> 01:03:20.974
- You'd better believe it!
- Don't push it, Roman!

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:23.242
You ain't even
seen pushin' yet!

01:03:23.316 --> 01:03:25.807
You know the trouble with you?
You wouldn't know a good time...

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:28.581
if it fell out of the sky, landed on
your face and started to wiggle.

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:33.684
You have a lot of nerve, Roman.
A lot of nerve.

01:03:33.759 --> 01:03:37.126
- It's served me well. I'm the one with the Mercedes.
- Ooh! Ah!

01:03:37.196 --> 01:03:39.426
By the way,
is it paid for?

01:03:39.499 --> 01:03:42.593
- Are you jealous, Chester?
- Don't call me Chester!

01:03:42.668 --> 01:03:45.831
Call me that one more time, you're gonna
go home with a dent in your forehead.

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:47.839
Oh-oh, yeah!
That'll be the day.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:50.467
- Would you like one to match his?
- Take your hands off her!

01:03:50.543 --> 01:03:54.274
- You wanna go right now?
- Dad, no one's denting anybody.

01:03:54.347 --> 01:03:57.339
- Thanks, Bucky.
- Oh, bite the big one, Uncle Roman!

01:03:57.416 --> 01:04:00.180
- Don't talk to adults that way!
- Why not?

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:03.086
- Because it's rude.
- Oh, blow it out your ass.

01:04:03.155 --> 01:04:05.646
Why don't we get out of here?
Come on, honey.

01:04:05.725 --> 01:04:10.389
- Come on, girls, let's go.
- It's the first good idea you've had since you've been here.

01:04:10.463 --> 01:04:13.296
And by the way,
don't steal any of our stuff.

01:04:13.366 --> 01:04:15.334
Ha-ha!
What stuff is there to steal?

01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:18.063
- We've got stuff!
- You're a louse!

01:04:18.137 --> 01:04:21.470
Oh! Well, go find yourself
a spin cycle.

01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:24.271
Yeah, go find yourself
a spin cycle.

01:04:24.343 --> 01:04:26.743
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- Never mind.

01:04:26.812 --> 01:04:29.178
- Calm down, calm down.
- Okay.

01:04:29.248 --> 01:04:32.615
- Dad?
- Yes, Ben?

01:04:32.685 --> 01:04:35.347
Does this mean we won't get
a Christmas present from Uncle Roman?

01:04:35.421 --> 01:04:37.355
Blow it out your ass, Ben!

01:04:37.423 --> 01:04:40.415
Okay, okay. Nobody's blowin'
anything out their ass.

01:04:40.493 --> 01:04:42.757
Okay? What we're having here
is a little problem.

01:04:42.828 --> 01:04:46.525
And your father and l... it does not mean
we don't love Uncle Roman and Aunt Kate.

01:04:46.599 --> 01:04:48.533
It just means that
we are having some emotions.

01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:53.163
What it means is I would like
to blow Uncle Roman out my ass!

01:04:53.239 --> 01:04:57.175
I don't want to hear any more about
anyone blowing anything out their ass.

01:04:57.243 --> 01:05:00.303
You might as well blow the whole
family out your ass while you're at it.

01:05:00.379 --> 01:05:03.678
Ben, do you understand
what's going on here?

01:05:03.749 --> 01:05:06.013
Do you understand what your mother
and I are trying to say?

01:05:06.085 --> 01:05:09.782
- Aunt Kate and Uncle Roman are butt heads. Right?
- Exactly.

01:05:21.233 --> 01:05:23.167
All right, troops,
mount up.

01:05:23.235 --> 01:05:25.032
We're ready to roll.

01:05:25.104 --> 01:05:27.038
You all packed?

01:05:27.106 --> 01:05:30.132
Actually, I just took a moment
to think things over.

01:05:30.209 --> 01:05:34.669
I'm gonna tell you something
I had previously decided not to.

01:05:34.747 --> 01:05:36.681
I came up here for a reason.

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:40.917
Chet, I came up here to talk
to you about an investment.

01:05:40.987 --> 01:05:43.182
I'll be quite honest.
I came up to solicit...

01:05:43.255 --> 01:05:46.918
- $25,000 from you.
- I knew it! I knew it!

01:05:46.993 --> 01:05:49.291
- I knew it!
- Hey, look.

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:51.922
A unique investment opportunity came
my way. I'm sitting in the office...

01:05:51.998 --> 01:05:56.059
trying to figure out a list of people to
bless with this opportunity, and I say bless...

01:05:56.135 --> 01:05:58.763
because this is so good and so sure,
it should be illegal.

01:05:58.838 --> 01:06:01.466
- And it probably is.
- It's not.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.168
It's inside,
but it's not illegal.

01:06:04.243 --> 01:06:07.212
The upside is phenomenal,
the downside is zip.

01:06:07.279 --> 01:06:11.477
As I was thinkin' about people I might want
to involve in this venture, your name came up.

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:14.713
Why? Because you are blood.
You're family.

01:06:14.787 --> 01:06:17.085
If a guy can't help his family,
what the hell good is he?

01:06:17.156 --> 01:06:21.388
The fact is, I came up here to offer you
a chance to make some really big money.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.258
It's funny you didn't mention
this before.

01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:26.855
- You didn't want to talk about money!
- Oh, baloney!

01:06:26.932 --> 01:06:30.891
- I was picking my moment.
- You were picking your nose.

01:06:34.106 --> 01:06:38.543
There's no mystery here, Chet.
I know how you really feel about me.

01:06:38.611 --> 01:06:42.012
- Do you?
- Yep.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:45.573
I knew that if I was ever to give you something,
you'd figure there'd be strings attached.

01:06:45.651 --> 01:06:48.848
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah, that's a fact.

01:06:50.523 --> 01:06:53.515
At our wedding...

01:06:53.592 --> 01:06:56.459
you were in the john
with Kate and Connie's dad.

01:06:56.529 --> 01:06:58.463
You were talking.

01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:02.160
Do you happen to remember
the substance of that conversation?

01:07:02.234 --> 01:07:04.168
No, I don't.

01:07:04.236 --> 01:07:06.796
Yeah, well I do.

01:07:06.872 --> 01:07:09.136
It's one I'll never forget.

01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:13.304
Because I heard you say,
and I quote,

01:07:13.379 --> 01:07:15.677
"That Roman Craig
is a crooked son of a bitch."

01:07:15.748 --> 01:07:19.684
The next time you stab
somebody in the back, Chester,

01:07:19.752 --> 01:07:22.084
you better check
under the stalls for feet.

01:07:22.154 --> 01:07:25.555
You may think I'm made
out of armor and nails,

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:27.922
but I'm just like
any other human being.

01:07:27.993 --> 01:07:30.985
And when I get cut, it hurts.
And that cut me.

01:07:31.063 --> 01:07:33.054
And I hurt.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.932
Roman, I'm...

01:07:38.003 --> 01:07:40.870
I'm sorry.
l...

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:44.205
I had a lot to drink
that night.

01:07:44.276 --> 01:07:47.712
And I really don't remember saying that.
But if you said I did,

01:07:49.448 --> 01:07:53.043
then...
I must have.

01:07:56.288 --> 01:08:00.622
I apologize to you both.
It was a terrible thing to say.

01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:05.594
Look, I don't hold grudges and
I don't have any hard feelings.

01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:08.189
To show you I'm the kind of guy
that can forgive and forget,

01:08:08.267 --> 01:08:12.328
well, I'd still like to offer you
a piece of that investment.

01:08:13.572 --> 01:08:17.474
You're sweet.

01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:20.444
I don't know what to say, Roman.
I, l...

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:23.448
I feel like a real idiot.

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:25.676
What exactly is
this thing again?

01:08:25.751 --> 01:08:29.413
That's $25,000.
What's your cash position?

01:08:29.488 --> 01:08:33.424
It isn't $25,000.
That's a lot of money.

01:08:33.492 --> 01:08:37.689
- Can you get it?
- No.

01:08:37.763 --> 01:08:41.493
I, uh... I think I can make
an arrangement or two...

01:08:41.567 --> 01:08:43.591
at the bank on Monday,
if that's okay.

01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:45.830
Look,
whatever you want to do.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.895
If you want, you can write a check now
for as much as you can cover.

01:08:47.973 --> 01:08:50.407
I'll make up the difference,
and we'll square it away on Monday.

01:08:50.475 --> 01:08:52.740
If that's okay with...

01:08:52.812 --> 01:08:55.042
- Is your checkbook in your purse?
- Yeah.

01:08:55.113 --> 01:08:59.015
Great. Okay.
Then that's fine.

01:09:03.756 --> 01:09:05.781
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

01:09:05.858 --> 01:09:09.122
I think it's a real testament
to the strength of the family...

01:09:09.194 --> 01:09:12.095
that we can disagree
so vehemently,

01:09:12.163 --> 01:09:16.122
and get on each other's nerves
so badly over the past week,

01:09:16.202 --> 01:09:18.136
and still part on good terms.

01:09:18.203 --> 01:09:21.139
Absolutely.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:24.005
After all the disagreements
that you and Chet had,

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:27.533
you still thought to include him
in that investment.

01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:30.013
I thought it was a wonderful
moment of trust on his part...

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.175
that he wrote you
that check.

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:34.276
That's a lot of money
for him.

01:09:34.353 --> 01:09:38.050
From what I gathered from Connie,
it's probably half a year's salary.

01:09:38.122 --> 01:09:41.456
I wouldn't be surprised if that was
Ben and Buck's college money.

01:09:41.527 --> 01:09:44.792
You know, you have a knack with
money, and I think it's great...

01:09:44.863 --> 01:09:49.801
that you're sharing it with him, and I
think it's great that he accepted your offer.

01:09:49.868 --> 01:09:52.837
That he trusts you
with his financial well-being.

01:09:52.904 --> 01:09:57.342
- I hope this investment
really works out for them.

01:09:57.409 --> 01:10:00.105
- I gotta go back.
- Did you forget something?

01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:04.105
Honey, you're scaring me.
Are you all right?

01:10:04.183 --> 01:10:06.310
I'll be all right
once I settle this.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.564
Roman, what are you doing?

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.003
- Katie, sit down.
- What?

01:10:27.072 --> 01:10:30.439
You'll need to sit down
to hear what I have to say.

01:10:32.411 --> 01:10:34.345
Oh, gee, it's wet!

01:10:34.413 --> 01:10:37.849
Hurry up!
Let's go.

01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:40.112
Chet, I'm gonna level with ya.

01:10:40.185 --> 01:10:43.416
I'm a phony, I'm a fraud,
I'm a fake.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:47.050
From my $15 imitation Bally slip-ons
to our replicated Rolexes.

01:10:47.126 --> 01:10:48.525
Ahh!

01:10:48.594 --> 01:10:52.052
We're broke, we're bankrupt,
we're busted.

01:10:52.131 --> 01:10:55.362
We're busted?

01:10:55.434 --> 01:10:59.268
We were living well, right?
Well beyond our means.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:04.002
I'm full of shit, Chet. I haven't
been trading in over two years.

01:11:05.744 --> 01:11:08.178
This deal came up, it looked good,
I got overextended,

01:11:08.247 --> 01:11:11.045
couldn't meet my calls,
I lost my seat on the exchange.

01:11:11.116 --> 01:11:14.108
I go to work every morning.

01:11:14.186 --> 01:11:18.418
But now I wear a blue runner's jacket
and fetch coffee.

01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:20.082
I lost everything.

01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:23.993
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you think I wouldn't understand?

01:11:24.063 --> 01:11:26.896
Baby, I knew you'd understand.

01:11:26.966 --> 01:11:29.400
But I also knew you wouldn't let me come
up here and put the bite on Connie and Chet.

01:11:29.468 --> 01:11:32.335
- It was my last hope.
- Look, Roman.

01:11:32.404 --> 01:11:35.862
You know I never
turn my back on family.

01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:39.377
I know.
That's why I came up here.

01:11:39.445 --> 01:11:42.881
By the way, that story about you and
your brother in the can at the wedding?

01:11:42.948 --> 01:11:44.916
I made it up.

01:11:47.152 --> 01:11:51.090
You what?
You made it up?

01:11:59.365 --> 01:12:01.765
All right,
I got it.

01:12:05.471 --> 01:12:07.803
Oh, geez!

01:12:09.441 --> 01:12:11.966
Whew!

01:12:12.044 --> 01:12:15.605
Ooh!
Oh, what happened?

01:12:15.681 --> 01:12:19.640
- Power's out!
- Where's the flashlight?

01:12:19.718 --> 01:12:24.052
- What happened to the lights?
- You kids been foolin' around with the flashlight?

01:12:24.123 --> 01:12:26.956
Look at this.
$110 for a lighter.

01:12:27.026 --> 01:12:31.486
- It doesn't even work.
- Seventy-nine cents. Ha!

01:12:31.563 --> 01:12:33.497
Whoa! Hot!
Ow!

01:12:33.565 --> 01:12:35.590
I haven't seen weather
like this for years.

01:12:35.667 --> 01:12:39.797
Roman?

01:12:39.872 --> 01:12:42.397
Where are the girls?

01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:45.436
Have you seen them?

01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:47.911
- Have you seen them?
- No.

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:52.474
All right, spread out. Let's look for them.
They're hidin' under a bed or somethin'.

01:12:56.388 --> 01:13:00.085
- It's this way.
- No, it's this way. I remember.

01:13:01.226 --> 01:13:04.161
Look for a big hole.

01:13:08.233 --> 01:13:10.497
We'll find 'em, Katie.

01:13:10.569 --> 01:13:13.333
They're gonna be all right. They'll
be okay. Don't worry about a thing.

01:13:13.405 --> 01:13:16.101
I want you boys to stay here and look
after your mother and your aunt.

01:13:16.175 --> 01:13:19.838
- We'll help you.
- Don't give me any lip. There's too much lightning out there.

01:13:19.912 --> 01:13:22.278
Here's the fence.
Here's the fence.

01:13:24.349 --> 01:13:26.544
Hey, wait for me!

01:13:26.618 --> 01:13:29.416
Cara! Mara!

01:13:32.191 --> 01:13:34.125
- Try this way.
- Okay.

01:13:37.463 --> 01:13:40.023
There we go.
There we go.

01:13:45.704 --> 01:13:47.899
I can't see anything.

01:13:49.575 --> 01:13:53.375
- Oh, neat!
- I found it. I wanna go first.

01:13:53.445 --> 01:13:56.141
No, I wanna!
I wanna!

01:13:56.215 --> 01:13:59.776
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:14:10.295 --> 01:14:14.356
Cara! Mara!
Girls!

01:14:25.277 --> 01:14:28.075
Cara! Mara!

01:14:28.147 --> 01:14:32.049
Girls!
Cara! Mara!

01:14:36.488 --> 01:14:39.082
Cara! Mara!

01:14:39.158 --> 01:14:42.855
- Help! Help!
- Put your light up there.

01:14:42.928 --> 01:14:44.862
There!

01:14:46.331 --> 01:14:50.392
Girls!
Girls, is that you? Girls!

01:14:50.469 --> 01:14:53.233
It's your Uncle Chet.
Are you all right?

01:14:53.305 --> 01:14:54.602
Help!

01:14:54.673 --> 01:14:56.903
We'll be right down.
Go on.

01:14:56.975 --> 01:14:59.034
- Not me.
- What?

01:14:59.111 --> 01:15:01.841
I'm claustrophobic. I get in
a closed-up space and I lock up.

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.677
- What if I lose it?
- You won't lose it.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:06.718
What if I blow it? What are we
gonna do? We gotta get help.

01:15:06.785 --> 01:15:09.754
We don't have time.
You can do it.

01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:13.780
Roman, they're your children.
Be their father, for God sakes.

01:15:13.859 --> 01:15:16.555
For the first time
in your life, be their father.

01:15:16.628 --> 01:15:19.825
Now, come on.
Get in there and help your kids.

01:15:22.701 --> 01:15:25.829
Girls, your dad will
be right down. Daddy's comin'.

01:15:25.904 --> 01:15:28.998
- Let's go. You can do it.
- All right.

01:15:29.074 --> 01:15:31.008
Come on. There you go.

01:15:31.076 --> 01:15:34.409
I'm gonna go get a light
and some rope. Okay?

01:15:34.479 --> 01:15:37.073
Are you all right?
Take it easy.

01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:39.777
Don't think about anything
like tight places.

01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:42.115
Like a submarine
or a coffin or anything.

01:15:42.187 --> 01:15:45.623
- Come back. You come back!
- I'll be back.

01:15:53.599 --> 01:15:55.965
Aah!

01:15:59.371 --> 01:16:02.932
Oh, my little sweeties!

01:16:03.008 --> 01:16:05.067
Oh! I love you.
I love you.

01:16:11.717 --> 01:16:15.551
Chet!
Chet, they're all right.

01:16:15.621 --> 01:16:18.454
"Apollo unicel..."

01:16:18.523 --> 01:16:20.787
It's dynamite!

01:16:20.859 --> 01:16:23.453
It's wet, old dynamite.

01:16:25.297 --> 01:16:27.697
It's fine. It's fine.

01:16:27.766 --> 01:16:30.030
Chet! Chet!

01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:35.331
Ripley!

01:16:35.407 --> 01:16:38.103
Okay.
We wanna get outta here.

01:16:38.176 --> 01:16:41.543
It's cold, it's wet, and you don't
want to stay here anymore, do you?

01:16:41.613 --> 01:16:45.481
Okay, hang onto Daddy as tight
as you can, all right? Okay?

01:16:49.521 --> 01:16:51.614
Ahh! Ooh! Ahh!

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.681
Big one!
Big spider! Big spider.

01:16:53.759 --> 01:16:57.752
Okay, climb on, Cara.
Mara, get on your sister's back.

01:16:57.829 --> 01:17:00.491
Okay, grab hold of my jacket.

01:17:00.565 --> 01:17:02.624
Hang on, okay?
Hang on tight.

01:17:04.169 --> 01:17:06.399
My babies.

01:17:19.818 --> 01:17:21.786
Which way?

01:17:23.922 --> 01:17:26.891
Hang on. We're almost there.
Almost there.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.762
Ah, gosh damn!

01:17:36.835 --> 01:17:38.769
Come on.

01:17:41.373 --> 01:17:44.240
Go, Cara, go!

01:17:56.455 --> 01:17:59.788
Let's just go back...
to the cabin.

01:18:01.626 --> 01:18:04.595
Your mother's probably
worried sick about you.

01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:08.556
Here we go! Okay.

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.468
Hang on.
Hang on.

01:18:14.172 --> 01:18:17.300
Roman! Girls!
I'm back.

01:18:17.376 --> 01:18:19.640
I got everything.
I'm here.

01:18:19.711 --> 01:18:21.736
I'll have you out
in a second.

01:18:21.813 --> 01:18:23.747
Just a minute.
Hold on.

01:18:23.815 --> 01:18:27.342
I'm sorry it took so long.
I'll explain it all later.

01:18:27.419 --> 01:18:31.014
Just a sec...
Get off me! I've got a rope.

01:18:31.089 --> 01:18:33.216
You'll be fine.

01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.623
I'm gonna tie a loop
at the end of this thing.

01:18:35.694 --> 01:18:37.685
Then I'm gonna throw it down.

01:18:37.763 --> 01:18:39.924
Then one at a time...

01:18:39.998 --> 01:18:42.262
I'll pull you up, okay?

01:18:42.334 --> 01:18:44.268
Here comes the rope.

01:18:44.336 --> 01:18:47.931
Watch your heads.
Here it comes!

01:18:52.277 --> 01:18:55.405
All right.
Have you got it?

01:18:57.416 --> 01:18:59.509
Okay, you got it?
Good.

01:18:59.584 --> 01:19:03.748
Okay. You let me know when you're
ready to come up, when you put it on.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:06.222
Okay?
Then I'll pull you up.

01:19:08.226 --> 01:19:10.217
Fine. You're ready.
Okay.

01:19:10.295 --> 01:19:12.195
Just a second.

01:19:12.264 --> 01:19:15.631
Okay, girls,
Uncle Chet's here.

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:18.635
Okay. Roman, you could help
on this, you know.

01:19:19.905 --> 01:19:24.308
All right.
One, two, three, go!

01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:28.372
Whoa! Hey!
What the hell are you doin'?

01:19:28.447 --> 01:19:31.416
When I say "ready,"
huh?

01:19:31.483 --> 01:19:33.417
When I say "ready."

01:19:33.485 --> 01:19:37.251
All right.
On "ready." Here we go.

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:42.086
Come on.
Help out a bit, will ya?

01:19:43.895 --> 01:19:46.830
Here it comes.
We'll be goin' home soon.

01:19:49.434 --> 01:19:52.528
Roman and I are gonna have
a talk later on, girls.

01:19:52.604 --> 01:19:55.767
We're gonna talk about...
helpin' people.

01:19:55.841 --> 01:19:59.675
Okay, here we go now.
Everybody help Uncle Chet.

01:19:59.744 --> 01:20:01.575
Come on! Yeah!

01:20:03.748 --> 01:20:05.443
We did it!

01:20:05.517 --> 01:20:10.352
I did it! Ahh!

01:20:16.928 --> 01:20:19.362
The bald-headed bear!

01:20:19.431 --> 01:20:22.025
Whoa!

01:20:35.614 --> 01:20:39.482
Whew. Whew!

01:20:39.551 --> 01:20:43.282
Whoa! Whoa!

01:20:47.526 --> 01:20:50.962
Whoa-oa-oa!
Big bear!

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.725
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

01:20:57.802 --> 01:21:01.499
No, no, go away.
Leave me alone! Go away!

01:21:04.209 --> 01:21:06.370
Oh!
Help!

01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:09.470
Help! Help!

01:21:17.923 --> 01:21:20.824
Hey, he's back, everybody!

01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:25.725
Chet! Hi!

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:27.822
Ha-ha!
Where the hell were ya?

01:21:27.899 --> 01:21:30.129
Come on in.
I'm making you a sandwich.

01:21:30.201 --> 01:21:32.726
Big! Big!
Whoo, big!

01:21:32.804 --> 01:21:34.669
Big? All right,
I'll make a big one.

01:21:34.739 --> 01:21:37.572
- Big... bear!
- Big bear!

01:21:37.642 --> 01:21:40.873
No! True! True!
Out there.

01:21:40.946 --> 01:21:43.471
We're glad you're home, honey.

01:21:43.548 --> 01:21:45.846
Big bear chase...
Big bear chase...

01:21:45.917 --> 01:21:47.248
- What is he saying?
- What?

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:50.288
Big bear chase me!
Whoo!

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.622
Upstairs!
There's a bear!

01:22:04.803 --> 01:22:07.795
Oh, get off me.
Get off, you son of a bitch.

01:22:09.107 --> 01:22:10.870
Roman. Roman.

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.744
Aah, uncle!
Uncle! Uncle!

01:22:20.819 --> 01:22:23.413
My God! Protect us!

01:22:26.725 --> 01:22:27.714
Mom.

01:22:34.799 --> 01:22:39.236
- Oh, honey!
- Connie, stay down! Stay down!

01:22:50.415 --> 01:22:54.317
Hit him with the poker!
Hit him!

01:22:59.357 --> 01:23:01.257
Look out, Roman!

01:23:07.032 --> 01:23:11.366
Big bear. Big bear chase me.

01:23:19.277 --> 01:23:22.974
Chase me!
Aah!

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:35.658
- Thank God you're here.
- Yeah, I'm here.

01:23:35.727 --> 01:23:37.058
Shoot him!

01:23:37.128 --> 01:23:39.961
- That's a goddamn lamp!
- But it's loaded.

01:23:40.031 --> 01:23:42.556
I can't hold on
much longer!

01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:50.241
Shoot him!

01:23:50.308 --> 01:23:53.402
Oh, right in the...

01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:14.255
- Okay, let's roll!
- All right.

01:24:14.332 --> 01:24:17.130
I can't believe that I'm
actually gonna miss this place.

01:24:17.202 --> 01:24:19.500
- Uncle Chet?
- Yes, sweetheart?

01:24:19.571 --> 01:24:21.596
I had
a really good time.

01:24:21.673 --> 01:24:24.608
- I'm glad.
- Thanks, Uncle Chet.

01:24:24.676 --> 01:24:27.201
My pleasure, sweetheart.
I hope you had a great time...

01:24:27.278 --> 01:24:29.644
'cause we had a nice time having
you, and we're gonna miss ya.

01:24:29.714 --> 01:24:31.773
Will I see you soon?

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:34.318
And don't drive too fast. All right.

01:24:34.385 --> 01:24:36.615
Take your seats...
in the trunk.

01:24:36.688 --> 01:24:38.883
Roman, knock it off.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:44.287
Cammie,
if you're out there...

01:24:44.362 --> 01:24:48.355
I just want you to know
I don't blame you for hating me.

01:24:48.433 --> 01:24:51.129
Do city boys
always talk to themselves?

01:24:57.742 --> 01:24:59.676
I'm really sorry...

01:24:59.744 --> 01:25:04.613
I want you to go back to Chicago
a crazed, lovesick maniac...

01:25:04.682 --> 01:25:08.778
who won't be able to look at another
girl without comparing her to me.

01:25:08.853 --> 01:25:11.481
Sounds good to me.

01:25:15.326 --> 01:25:18.159
You're a good man.
You're the best.

01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:20.254
You're not so bad
yourself.

01:25:21.933 --> 01:25:25.801
- You drive safely.
- Thanks.

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:28.065
- Race you home.
- You got it.

01:25:30.341 --> 01:25:32.275
Race you home.

01:25:33.845 --> 01:25:35.813
Take care!

01:25:37.081 --> 01:25:39.709
Bye, bye.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.612
Race you home!

01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:49.091
Why would he say
"race me home"?

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.789
- He lives way out in Oak Park.
- It's just 'til he gets on his feet.

01:25:52.864 --> 01:25:56.698
I think you should be proud of him
not wanting to take your loan.

01:25:56.768 --> 01:26:00.397
- What are you saying?
- Huh? We have plenty of room.

01:26:00.471 --> 01:26:02.530
Connie, he is not staying
at our house.

01:26:02.607 --> 01:26:06.566
If he beats us, he'll get
the good spot in the garage!

01:26:06.644 --> 01:26:09.135
- To the memories.
- To the memories.

01:26:10.982 --> 01:26:13.314
- Chester!
- Buckley!

01:26:13.384 --> 01:26:15.909
Get the hell in the car. We gotta
beat Uncle Roman home. Move it!

01:26:15.987 --> 01:26:18.080
Move it, everybody!
Let's go!

01:26:18.156 --> 01:26:20.624
