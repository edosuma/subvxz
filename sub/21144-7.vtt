00:02.144 --> 00:03.051
- What's up, guys? I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

00:03.087 --> 00:04.711
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

00:04.746 --> 00:06.329
Are you sick of your parents

00:06.364 --> 00:07.542
driving you places
and cramping your style?

00:07.566 --> 00:10.709
Well, what if the way you
got places gave you style?

00:10.745 --> 00:12.936
- Nice! Unscripted.
- Thank you.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.688

01:59.670 --> 02:01.377
From the... street.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.346
No problem.
We can take these back,

02:03.381 --> 02:04.751
assuming you still have
your receipt.

03:01.856 --> 03:04.099
(panting)
Bernard. Bernard. Bernard.

03:04.134 --> 03:05.825
Grandma? Wh-what are
you doing here?

03:05.861 --> 03:08.086
I have a surprise!

03:08.121 --> 03:10.105
I'm so proud of you
for finishing

03:10.140 --> 03:11.982
that wilderness class
I signed you up for,

03:12.017 --> 03:13.808
I'm taking you on a camping trip

03:13.844 --> 03:15.121
so you can show off your skills!

03:15.145 --> 03:17.320
Really? When?

03:17.355 --> 03:19.698
Tonight! And the whole gang
is invited.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.391
Dirk, Fake Girlfriend,

03:21.426 --> 03:23.493
Braids, Hangs With Braids.

03:23.528 --> 03:24.945
Count me in, Grandma!

03:24.980 --> 03:26.713
I love camping!

03:26.749 --> 03:28.790
I'll text my mom
and see if I can go too.

03:28.825 --> 03:30.617
It's so exciting!
I've never been camping.

03:30.652 --> 03:32.869
Look, I'm gonna pass.
I'm not a camper.

03:32.904 --> 03:35.738
Fresh air makes me feel
like I'm choking.

03:35.774 --> 03:37.958
I'm out too. I've heard
the WiFi in nature is terrible.

03:39.269 --> 03:40.844
Let's get packing!

03:40.879 --> 03:41.973
- Frankie: Bye.
- Grandma: Bye.

03:41.997 --> 03:43.271
- Dirk: Bye.
- Amelia: Text me.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.906
(people chattering)

03:44.941 --> 03:46.641
- Looks like it's just you and me.
- Yup.

03:46.676 --> 03:48.685
Me and you. (Chuckles)

03:48.720 --> 03:49.803
(chattering continues)

03:57.520 --> 04:00.005
- Ah! This is so awkward.
- I know.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.632
When... when our friends
are around, we're fine,

04:02.667 --> 04:04.754
but when it's just the two of
us, we have nothing to say,

04:04.778 --> 04:06.403
and we just bury ourselves
in our phones.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.506
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

04:09.541 --> 04:10.541
Frankie...

04:11.993 --> 04:13.435
we need to be better friends.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.437
We're around each other
all the time.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.388
What if we get paired up
for a science project?

04:17.424 --> 04:19.733
Or we find ourselves
on the couch, alone,

04:19.768 --> 04:20.804
after everyone else
has gone on a...

04:20.828 --> 04:22.836
(gasps) It's happening!

04:24.365 --> 04:28.208
You're right. You know,
we... we never actually try

04:28.243 --> 04:29.993
to hang out, just the two of us.

04:30.028 --> 04:31.870
It can't be that hard
to become better friends.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.688
- Yeah.
- All we have to do

04:33.723 --> 04:36.491
is find something
we both have in common.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.613
Yeah. How about we just, um,
we take turns listing things

04:38.637 --> 04:40.381
we like alphabetically until we
find something we both like?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.063
- Okay. I'll go first.
- Okay.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.775
"A." Amelia.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.064
Well, this is off
to a great start.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.877
(growls) Okay. "V."

04:55.912 --> 04:56.786
- Violets.
- Frankie: Violence.

04:56.822 --> 04:57.973
(gasps) Did you say "violence"?

04:57.997 --> 04:59.848
No, I said, "Violets."

04:59.883 --> 05:01.657
Pretty purple flowers.

05:01.693 --> 05:04.085
Ah! All those words are
the opposite of "violence"!

05:06.715 --> 05:07.964
"W."

05:09.409 --> 05:11.150
Both: Wing Time Willy's.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.211
Did you just say,
"Wing Time Willy's"?

05:13.247 --> 05:15.747
Home of the Hundred
Hot Wings Challenge! Yes!

05:15.782 --> 05:17.716
I've always wanted
to do the challenge,

05:17.751 --> 05:21.202
- but I've never had a partner.
- Me neither. Paige can't handle spicy food.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.848
- She sweats from her ears. It's gross.
- Ugh.

05:24.883 --> 05:29.902
Amelia, will you do Wing Time Willy's
Hundred Hot Wings Challenge with me?

05:29.938 --> 05:34.165
Honey, I'll do anything where the prize is
getting my picture on a wall. (Giggles)

05:34.200 --> 05:35.675
Now let's go
scarf down hot wings

05:35.711 --> 05:37.631
until our mouths burn
and we taste our own blood!

05:39.664 --> 05:40.664
I dig this side of you.

05:45.003 --> 05:47.896
Oh! I can't believe
I'm going camping!

05:47.931 --> 05:50.418
Do you think we'll see bears? The
baby ones are okay to hug, right?

05:50.442 --> 05:52.322
Actually, don't tell me.
I want to be surprised.

05:54.429 --> 05:56.704
Well, it looks like
we're all packed.

05:56.740 --> 05:59.260
Let's make like my fourth ex-husband
and get outta here quickly.

06:00.677 --> 06:02.310
Dude, I gotta
tell you something.

06:04.047 --> 06:05.308
I'm not really a camping expert.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.041
You made that up?

06:08.076 --> 06:10.818
Wait. You still have that supermodel
girlfriend, though, right?

06:10.854 --> 06:12.014
Yeah, don't worry about that.

06:14.182 --> 06:16.807
I never went to the wilderness
class Grandma signed me up for.

06:16.843 --> 06:20.737
Remember that Irish dancing game
that was at Vuuugle for a while?

06:20.772 --> 06:24.065
(Irish jig music playing)

06:24.101 --> 06:25.967
(fail music plays)

06:26.044 --> 06:27.129
(Irish accent) Give up on
that game now, laddie!

06:27.153 --> 06:29.437
Your footwork is rubbish.

06:29.473 --> 06:33.383
You'll never beat
Seamus O'Tierney's top score!

06:33.418 --> 06:35.844
And I should know.
I'm Seamus O'Tierney.

06:39.241 --> 06:41.268
Bernie: <i>I couldn't let that Australian
guy talk to me like that...</i>

06:41.292 --> 06:43.710
(Irish jig music playing)

06:43.745 --> 06:46.846
<i>so I became obsessed
with beating his top score.</i>

06:46.881 --> 06:49.052
<i>Every day Grandma dropped me
off for wilderness class,</i>

06:49.076 --> 06:51.159
<i>but I went to Vuuugle instead.</i>

06:51.194 --> 06:53.636
Ya call that dancing?

06:53.671 --> 06:55.488
It's like you're digging
a hole in the floor!

06:57.834 --> 06:59.918
Bernie:
<i>And finally, it paid off...</i>

06:59.953 --> 07:01.911
(music playing faster)

07:04.124 --> 07:05.124
Look at him.

07:08.711 --> 07:09.871
- (music stops)
- (bell dings)

07:11.381 --> 07:14.215
Congratulations, Bernie Shotz!

07:14.250 --> 07:16.759
You've earned your pick
of any maiden in the lounge.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.669
(American accent)
Eh, it's just dudes.

07:22.793 --> 07:25.310
I have to stop this trip
before we get to the campsite,

07:25.345 --> 07:27.678
or Grandma's gonna know
I wasted her $500.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.273
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Not a problem.

07:30.308 --> 07:33.810
I took Grandma's car key
and threw it out the window.

07:33.845 --> 07:37.289
With my arm strength, it's probably in
the next town. We're not going anywhere.

07:37.324 --> 07:40.108
Ah, Bern-Man,
why did you tell me that?

07:40.143 --> 07:41.387
If someone asks me
what's going on,

07:41.411 --> 07:43.378
I'll have to tell the truth.

07:43.455 --> 07:45.447
You know the three pillars
of the DareMeBro Code:

07:45.482 --> 07:47.548
Take all dares, never lie,

07:47.583 --> 07:48.583
and the world is flat.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.261
Wait, what?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.706
L-look, if Grandma
asks you about this,

07:54.741 --> 07:56.524
just tell her a different truth.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.634
That way you're not lying.

07:57.669 --> 07:59.152
I can do that.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.788
Hey! Frick and Frack.

08:02.824 --> 08:05.344
I can't find my car key. Do you
have any idea where it could be?

08:05.669 --> 08:07.852
Uh... I cry when I see bunnies!

08:07.887 --> 08:11.923
- Huh?
- And there's, uh, there's lots of bunnies in the forest

08:11.958 --> 08:16.094
and no car, so we can't go camping.
I'll start unpacking.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.137
Hey, Grandma Shotz.
I found your key.

08:18.172 --> 08:19.873
It was laying
just outside the window,

08:19.908 --> 08:21.449
literally inches from the house.

08:23.386 --> 08:25.578
(groans) I've been having
rotator cuff issues.

08:27.791 --> 08:30.316
Great work, Braids.
Let's hit the road.

08:30.351 --> 08:31.809
Nothing's gonna stop us
from camping!

08:31.844 --> 08:35.822
Oh, by the way, the car stereo
is busted, but don't worry.

08:35.857 --> 08:38.433
I know hundreds of driving
songs from my trucker days.

08:38.468 --> 08:40.360
♪ Peeing in a cup,
peeing in a cup ♪

08:40.395 --> 08:42.170
♪ Such a long trip ♪

08:42.205 --> 08:43.554
♪ Shoulda brought a bigger cup ♪

08:43.590 --> 08:45.098
Woo! Camping, camping, camping!

08:48.737 --> 08:51.713
These girls have one hour
to eat a hundred wings!

08:51.748 --> 08:55.049
No napkins. No leavin' the table.
No drinks.

08:55.085 --> 08:57.513
Does imported sparkling pomegranate
iced tea count as a drink?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.428
No drinks.

08:59.464 --> 09:01.156
(bottle shatters)

09:01.191 --> 09:02.198
That cost $80!

09:04.869 --> 09:06.389
All right, Amelia,
we need to win this,

09:06.413 --> 09:08.941
- so don't do that thing where you eat all dainty.
- (air horn blares)

09:08.965 --> 09:10.665
(grunting)

09:12.810 --> 09:13.810
Are you eating the bones?

09:15.305 --> 09:18.089
(rock music playing)

09:21.994 --> 09:22.994
Nibble.

09:40.805 --> 09:43.565
- Oh! Too spicy!
- (blows)

09:43.600 --> 09:45.575
- Ooh! Hot, hot!
- (blows)

09:49.489 --> 09:51.013
Okay, one last wing!

09:51.049 --> 09:52.489
Eat through the pain!
Eat through it!

09:55.470 --> 09:57.795
(cheering)

10:00.083 --> 10:02.559
(grunts, laughs)

10:02.594 --> 10:05.144
Amelia, that... (belches)
was amazing.

10:05.179 --> 10:07.188
I know. I can't believe we...

10:07.223 --> 10:09.682
(belches) ...did it.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.470
You know, maybe... (belches)
we're better friends...

10:14.505 --> 10:15.730
(belches) than we thought.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.483
Hey, do you wanna
sleep over tonight?

10:19.519 --> 10:23.104
Oh my gosh. Yes, I'd love to.

10:23.139 --> 10:25.459
This is gonna be the most epic
weekend of our entire lives.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.234
We have nothing else
in common, do we?

10:32.732 --> 10:33.732
(belching): Nope.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.561
- Hey, guys! I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.188
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.919
Today, we are doing
the Cotton Ball Challenge.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.768
Yeah, so basically,

10:44.770 --> 10:45.863
we're gonna put some
sticky stuff on our noses,

10:45.887 --> 10:47.364
- put our hands behind our back.
- Behind our back.

10:47.388 --> 10:48.971
Whoever puts
all the cotton balls

10:49.007 --> 10:50.881
into the other bowl first wins.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.161
This is why the
Internet was invented.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.710
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, yeah. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Okay.

10:54.745 --> 10:56.321
- Ready, set...
- Wait. No. Hold on.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.263
- Ready? Wait, no.
- Hold on.

10:57.298 --> 10:58.364
My hair. (Laughs)

10:58.399 --> 11:00.908
No. Stop. Gotta get...

11:00.944 --> 11:02.120
- Gotta be standing straight. Ready, set, go.
- Okay, ready?

11:02.144 --> 11:04.662
- (whistle tweets)
- (rock music playing)

11:04.697 --> 11:07.356
- Frankie: Oh! Ah! Okay.
- (Paige laughs)

11:07.391 --> 11:09.375
Ponytail timeout.

11:09.410 --> 11:11.485
- Hold on.
- Look at... look at...

11:11.520 --> 11:13.908
- We gotta resume.
- Look at all these ones that you got... Wait!

11:13.932 --> 11:15.597
Mine's over here!

11:15.633 --> 11:17.458
- (spits)
- Paige: I got it!

11:17.494 --> 11:18.668
- I'm good.
- (inhales)

11:18.703 --> 11:20.086
(inhales, spits)

11:20.122 --> 11:22.180
(dings) - I didn't cheat.
(laughs)

11:22.215 --> 11:23.489
But I got them all in there.

11:23.524 --> 11:26.025
Me too, but I got it first.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.680
- (giggles) I win.
- How did you get them all in there?

11:27.704 --> 11:29.104
With my nose.
How else do you think?

11:34.469 --> 11:35.417
We're not leaving here until you pick
all those up and put 'em in that bowl.

11:35.453 --> 11:36.561
You didn't say how.

11:38.339 --> 11:39.355
(laughs)

11:43.336 --> 11:47.305
This is ridiculous! Paige, Bernie, and
Dirk are gonna come back from camping

11:47.340 --> 11:48.993
with fun stories about
how much they bonded.

11:49.017 --> 11:50.194
And... and what are
we gonna have?

11:50.218 --> 11:51.751
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

11:51.786 --> 11:53.844
Except our picture
on a wall of winners

11:53.880 --> 11:56.998
- and endless indigestion.
- (stomach grumbles)

11:57.033 --> 11:58.791
You said this weekend
was gonna be epic.

11:58.827 --> 12:01.552
We-we... we burped our feelings.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.771
We wiped sauce on each other.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.339
We have the foundation
of a friendship.

12:07.376 --> 12:09.010
Now... we must build
on that foundation.

12:11.238 --> 12:13.222
Time is not on our side,

12:13.257 --> 12:15.308
but... I'm sure if we show
each other stuff

12:15.343 --> 12:17.593
we like to do,

12:17.629 --> 12:20.780
we'll find something else
we're both into.

12:20.815 --> 12:23.365
I knew we had
something else in common.

12:23.401 --> 12:25.287
I love karaoke. Wh-what kind
of songs are we gonna do?

12:25.311 --> 12:26.311
- Songs?
- Yeah.

12:27.530 --> 12:29.831
Why would I waste it on songs?

12:29.866 --> 12:31.574
I bought it 'cause it does this.

12:31.609 --> 12:33.084
(clears throat)

12:33.119 --> 12:34.636
Amelia. (Echoing)

12:34.671 --> 12:36.921
Amelia. (Echoing)

12:36.956 --> 12:39.456
Amelia. (Echoing)

12:39.492 --> 12:40.833
Seriously? (Echoing)

12:45.831 --> 12:48.482
- ♪ So much pee ♪
- Dirk: ♪ Eee... ♪

12:48.518 --> 12:50.919
All (harmonizing): ♪ Eeee ♪

12:50.954 --> 12:52.445
♪ Shoulda brought a bigger cup ♪

12:52.480 --> 12:56.324
(laughter)

12:56.359 --> 12:58.960
Okay, okay, so I've been rubbing
these weird-looking plants

12:58.995 --> 13:00.356
all over my skin
to give myself a rash.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.847
I think I can get this trip
canceled for real this time.

13:02.883 --> 13:07.468
Bern-Man, just tell your
Grandma you wasted her $500.

13:07.503 --> 13:08.977
What's the worst
she could do to you?

13:09.013 --> 13:12.031
Ahh! I stubbed my toe
on this stupid branch!

13:17.989 --> 13:21.349
Uh-oh, look at this rash.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.779
I must've come into contact with
something poisonous. -(Gasps)

13:23.803 --> 13:25.528
According
to my wilderness expertise,

13:25.563 --> 13:26.471
we should end
this trip immediately.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.140
Oh, hang on. I brought
a plant remedy field guide.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.341
A what whaty what what?

13:32.528 --> 13:35.162
These leaves
should cure that rash.

13:35.198 --> 13:36.425
You know, I really think the
hospital would be the safer option.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.275
Nah. Hey, Braids!

13:39.311 --> 13:41.330
While you're at it, can you cure the
rash on his lower back and legs?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.470
(whispers) Grandma!

13:42.505 --> 13:43.505
(mouths) What?

13:47.235 --> 13:49.035
- (Grandma gasps)
- (gasps) It's working!

13:49.070 --> 13:51.904
Yeah. You can see
the rash fading already.

13:56.928 --> 14:00.020
Okay, the rules of New
World Pioneers are simple.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.674
If you roll a six or lower, you
get a dozen bushels of wheat,

14:02.709 --> 14:04.650
which you can
either eat, store or trade

14:04.685 --> 14:07.328
for three donkeys
and/or seven otter pelts,

14:07.363 --> 14:09.508
only if you roll a nine or
higher on your next three turns.

14:09.532 --> 14:10.840
- Got it.
- Okay.

14:13.811 --> 14:14.922
- (bush rustles)
- (dice thud)

14:14.946 --> 14:15.970
Game over, I win!

14:21.127 --> 14:23.586
Okay, good bathroom break.

14:23.621 --> 14:25.471
- Everyone ready to keep hiking?
- Kids: Yeah!

14:25.506 --> 14:26.506
(flatly) Yeah.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.785
(nervously) Um, who is this?

14:30.820 --> 14:34.113
Oh, this is Wolftooth.

14:34.148 --> 14:36.273
He lives in the woods.
I invited him to hike with us.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.960
Okay. What do you do
in the woods, Wolftooth?

14:39.996 --> 14:41.120
Bury stuff.

14:41.155 --> 14:42.155
Mmm.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.809
(whispers) Uh, Bern-Man?

14:46.845 --> 14:49.403
This dude looks like
he could hurt us.

14:49.439 --> 14:52.079
(whispers) I know! We're totally
not gonna make it to the campsite!

14:53.643 --> 14:56.427
So, umm... that's a, uh...

14:57.972 --> 15:00.656
a nice ax, Wolftooth.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.825
Yeah, I had a bigger one,
but it got stuck...

15:02.860 --> 15:04.060
somewhere.

15:07.531 --> 15:11.033
Ha-have you, umm, ever thought
about being a lumberjack?

15:11.068 --> 15:13.786
Actually, that was my dream,

15:13.822 --> 15:16.542
but my parents wanted me to go into
the family's accounting business.

15:17.283 --> 15:21.252
Accounting? But you don't
want to chop numbers.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.003
You want to chop trees.

15:23.038 --> 15:24.705
That's what I told them.

15:27.685 --> 15:29.460
So, what you're saying is...

15:31.164 --> 15:32.914
- trees are my path...
- Mm-hmm.

15:32.949 --> 15:34.923
- The sky is my future...
- Mmm.

15:34.959 --> 15:37.134
And the ax is my true spirit!

15:39.380 --> 15:40.399
I think you're ready
to live your dream.

15:40.423 --> 15:41.672
You're right.

15:41.708 --> 15:45.276
I'm gonna find the nearest
lumberjack school and enroll.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.228
My new life begins now!

15:49.866 --> 15:52.366
By the way, I was planning

15:52.402 --> 15:54.944
on stealing your stuff and
leaving you all in the woods.

15:54.979 --> 15:57.029
You can all thank Paige
your camping trip continues.

15:58.349 --> 15:59.991
(growls)

16:08.960 --> 16:11.210
Okay, if you're not
gonna look for me,

16:11.245 --> 16:13.087
then it's technically
not hide-and-seek.

16:14.991 --> 16:17.725
Amelia, let's just
give up, okay?

16:17.760 --> 16:19.994
We tried everything,
but besides wings,

16:20.029 --> 16:21.887
we don't have
anything in common.

16:21.922 --> 16:24.098
Maybe our friendship
just is what it is.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.868
- (screams)
- Both: Raccoon!

16:27.903 --> 16:29.061
(screaming)

16:32.408 --> 16:33.149
Hey, kids! I'm Dirk!

16:33.184 --> 16:34.817
And I'm Bernie.

16:34.852 --> 16:35.609
And today, we're
gonna be telling you

16:35.645 --> 16:36.718
a magical kids' story

16:36.754 --> 16:37.561
- one...
- word...

16:37.596 --> 16:38.596
at...

16:41.417 --> 16:42.917
a time. We'll work on it.

16:42.952 --> 16:45.444
- Here we go!
- Okay, the title will be...

16:45.479 --> 16:46.537
"Trucks and Waffles."

16:49.216 --> 16:50.216
waffle...

16:51.402 --> 16:52.442
- trucks...
- (truck honks)

16:53.179 --> 16:54.179
bought...

16:55.965 --> 16:57.423
- the syrup.
- (buzzer)

16:57.459 --> 16:58.610
- Sorry.
- You said two words!

16:58.634 --> 17:00.034
I know, I'm sorry.
The... -town...

17:00.837 --> 17:01.837
- bought...
- syrup...

17:03.573 --> 17:04.573
syrup...

17:05.133 --> 17:06.140
"drove," uh...

17:08.903 --> 17:09.903
butter...

17:11.697 --> 17:12.697
butter...

17:17.286 --> 17:18.286
friends...

17:21.549 --> 17:22.549
syrup...

17:27.438 --> 17:28.438
syrup...

17:36.330 --> 17:37.738
syrup.

17:37.773 --> 17:38.813
- Do that, kids.
- Do that.

17:41.969 --> 17:43.511
Thank you, guys,
so much for watching.

17:43.546 --> 17:45.506
- We're gonna go buy some waffles.
- Okay. Oh wow.

17:48.059 --> 17:49.778
- Go, go, go! Where is it? Go, go, go! Go, go!
- I don't see him!

17:49.802 --> 17:52.653
(girls scream)

17:52.688 --> 17:54.313
Why did my dad pick tonight

17:54.349 --> 17:56.699
to do a 12-hour surgery?

17:56.734 --> 17:58.776
Don't worry.
I grew up on a farm.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.502
- I know how to scare off raccoons.
- Okay.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.506
- Human sacrifice!
- Wait! No, you go.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.760
- No, you go! You go!
- No, it's fine, you go. Go ahead, go ahead.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.884
(thinking) <i>Good evening.
I assume you girls</i>

18:06.919 --> 18:10.104
<i>don't speak raccoon, so I'll
communicate telepathically.</i>

18:10.139 --> 18:11.489
- No, you go.
- No, you go.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.915
- No, no, go ahead. Go.
- Frankie!

18:12.951 --> 18:15.209
(thinking) <i>My name is Wallace,</i>

18:15.244 --> 18:16.972
<i>and I seem to have wandered
off from my family.</i>

18:16.996 --> 18:17.879
<i>Can you tell me where I am?</i>

18:17.914 --> 18:19.296
No, I can't go.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.459
(thinking) <i>Hmm, perhaps you'll
be able to understand me better</i>

18:24.495 --> 18:27.037
<i>if I speak in a gentle,
soothing voice.</i>

18:27.072 --> 18:28.552
- (Wallace screeches)
- (girls scream)

18:30.718 --> 18:32.059
(thinking) <i>Okay, zero for two.</i>

18:34.055 --> 18:35.680
<i>What if I stood like a human?</i>

18:35.715 --> 18:37.398
<i>That should ease your fears.</i>

18:37.433 --> 18:39.942
- It's gonna attack!
- Get on the island!

18:39.978 --> 18:42.686
- Go! Go, go, go, go!
- (screams)

18:42.722 --> 18:46.148
Wallace: <i>Oh! I see we're
climbing onto things now.</i>

18:46.184 --> 18:48.517
<i>What fun! I bet
I can get up there too!</i>

18:48.553 --> 18:49.743
(girls screaming)

18:52.840 --> 18:55.257
Finally! My first campsite.

18:55.292 --> 18:57.935
(inhales) First smell of pine.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.688
(sneezes) First
reaction to pine.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.473
(squeals)

19:02.508 --> 19:07.186
All right, I wanna see
my survival expert at work.

19:07.221 --> 19:08.996
Let me see you set up a tent.

19:09.031 --> 19:10.481
Now, hang on.
In wilderness class,

19:10.516 --> 19:13.625
I learned that the most
important part of camping is

19:13.661 --> 19:15.869
identifying trees.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.913
Yup, there's one
of those triangle trees.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.256
Very common for this area.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.091
- Oh.
- (phone camera clicks)

19:21.127 --> 19:23.919
Bernard, the tent!

19:23.954 --> 19:26.438
Oh. Uh, right, okay.

19:26.474 --> 19:28.657
So, the first step is
you need to skillfully

19:28.692 --> 19:30.353
and carefully take
the tent out of the bag.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.911
(rustling)

19:36.943 --> 19:38.417
Clearly, these are
defective tents.

19:40.196 --> 19:42.296
These tents are
so easy to put up.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.451
Bernard, what is going on?

19:47.487 --> 19:49.895
Umm, I...

19:49.930 --> 19:54.150
Dirk, what is going on?

19:54.185 --> 19:56.143
Bern-Man used
your wilderness class money

19:56.179 --> 19:58.820
on an Irish dancing arcade game

19:58.856 --> 20:01.576
and wouldn't stop because an old guy
said he couldn't beat his score!

20:03.202 --> 20:04.526
Bernard, is that true?

20:07.239 --> 20:09.456
Yeah, Grandma, it... it's true.

20:09.491 --> 20:11.425
I wanted you to take that class

20:11.461 --> 20:13.660
so you would grow up
and learn some life skills.

20:13.696 --> 20:15.462
Instead, you wasted my money.

20:15.497 --> 20:17.206
I am very disappointed in you.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.931
(Wallace chittering)

20:25.967 --> 20:28.111
- He's got your cell phone.
- Well, what's a raccoon gonna do with...

20:28.135 --> 20:29.760
- (phone camera clicks)
- (gasps)

20:31.422 --> 20:32.422
Don't post that, raccoon!

20:34.066 --> 20:38.236
Oh! Amelia, how are we gonna
get out of here? I'm scared!

20:38.312 --> 20:42.247
You listen to me, Frankie
middle-name-unknown Wong!

20:42.283 --> 20:44.091
We will make it out
of this house alive.

20:44.127 --> 20:46.502
- We will?
- Yes.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.548
Before today, did you think we could
eat a hundred wings in an hour?

20:48.572 --> 20:49.572
- Yes.
- Well, we did.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.751
So here's the plan. You and I are
gonna climb off this island together

20:54.787 --> 20:58.847
with our heads held high and our
hearts filled with courage!

20:58.883 --> 21:00.043
- You with me?
- I'm with you!

21:02.603 --> 21:03.860
- Ready?
- Ready.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.421
(girls screaming)

21:11.186 --> 21:12.511
(gasping)

21:14.223 --> 21:17.140
Bernard! We're
surrounded by scorpions!

21:17.176 --> 21:19.451
Go find someone who can save us!

21:19.487 --> 21:22.229
- (musical chimes)
- Use your lucky feet, laddie.

21:22.265 --> 21:23.772
It's what you've trained for.

21:25.293 --> 21:27.960
No! I'll save you!

21:27.995 --> 21:29.623
Dirk, turn your flashlights
on and off like a video game!

21:29.647 --> 21:31.513
On it!

21:31.548 --> 21:33.773
Paige, play an Irish
dancing song!

21:33.809 --> 21:36.076
Uh, are we talking
more hornpipe or slip jig?

21:38.439 --> 21:39.799
I'll just go
with what feels right.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.542
- And, Grandma, heckle me!
- (Irish jig playing)

21:43.577 --> 21:45.817
Are we talking insult your
manhood or general appearance?

21:47.439 --> 21:49.990
I'll just go
with what feels right.

21:50.025 --> 21:53.227
You walk like a duck.
You sleep in a baby bed.

21:53.262 --> 21:56.096
I've lost you
in a poker game. Twice!

21:57.941 --> 21:59.157
(exhales)

21:59.193 --> 22:01.226
(fast-tempo Irish jig playing)

22:11.322 --> 22:13.063
(music ends)

22:13.098 --> 22:14.498
Bern-Man, that was legit!

22:14.533 --> 22:17.434
Totally! Now what's your
plan to get us out of here?

22:17.469 --> 22:19.904
Okay, so according
to my wilderness expertise...

22:19.939 --> 22:21.299
Darn it,
that doesn't work anymore.

22:22.391 --> 22:23.391
Hang on.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.361
These are emperor scorpions.

22:27.396 --> 22:29.023
We studied them in class.
They don't sting!

22:29.047 --> 22:33.233
Whoa. Emperor scorpions?

22:33.269 --> 22:35.189
I didn't know we were
in the presence of royalty.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.596
It's an honor, sir.

22:40.843 --> 22:43.168
Grandma, I'm sorry
I lied to you.

22:43.204 --> 22:45.153
Thank you, Bernard.

22:45.188 --> 22:47.881
I am so proud of you.

22:47.916 --> 22:49.261
I thought you were
disappointed in me,

22:49.285 --> 22:50.993
and I didn't save you.

22:51.028 --> 22:52.961
I'm not disappointed.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.196
What you did took courage.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.340
You don't need
a wilderness class

22:57.376 --> 22:58.856
to prove to me
that you're growing up.

23:00.279 --> 23:01.645
- Thanks, Grandma.
- (chuckles)

23:01.681 --> 23:04.606
(rustling)

23:04.642 --> 23:07.259
I just found out there's no such
thing as lumberjack school.

23:07.295 --> 23:09.378
(screaming)

23:15.027 --> 23:17.202
(sighs) Well, it's official.

23:17.237 --> 23:19.163
It's the raccoon's house now.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.958
Yup. My dad is not gonna
be happy about that.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.446
And remember how we didn't
want to go camping,

23:25.470 --> 23:27.362
but now we're
literally outside, camping?

23:27.397 --> 23:29.314
Even better, we're "glamping."

23:31.519 --> 23:33.769
- And thanks, Amelia.
- For what?

23:33.804 --> 23:35.045
For saving me back there.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.405
What are friends for?

23:38.517 --> 23:40.417
- How crazy was today?
- So crazy.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.269
We ate a hundred wings,

23:42.304 --> 23:44.095
we met the actual
Wing Time Willy,

23:44.131 --> 23:45.939
and then a raccoon
tried to kill us.

23:45.974 --> 23:47.774
I know. We were stuck
on the island,

23:47.809 --> 23:49.409
and we were like... (screams)

23:49.445 --> 23:51.023
and then the raccoon as like...
(screeches)

23:51.047 --> 23:53.956
(both laugh)

23:53.991 --> 23:55.051
Wallace (thinking): <i>I can hear
you, and that is not how I sound.</i>

23:55.075 --> 23:56.976
<i>Just for that, I'm posting</i>

23:57.011 --> 24:02.981
<i>that unflattering photo
I took of you.</i>
