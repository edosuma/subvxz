06:22.000 --> 06:23.788
I beat her, okay?

06:23.788 --> 06:24.000
There was someone else there,
and I couldn't see who.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.857
There was someone else there,
and I couldn't see who.

06:25.857 --> 06:26.000
[Dr. Ito] A new member

06:29.060 --> 06:30.000
Stargirl isn't the only one
we're dealing with.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.562
Stargirl isn't the only one
we're dealing with.

06:31.596 --> 06:32.000
-Dad--
-And even so,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.932
-Dad--
-And even so,

06:38.000 --> 06:38.002
you put on your graduation
uniform without my approval,

06:38.036 --> 06:40.000
you took my staff
and you went out,
risking exposure,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
you took my staff
and you went out,
risking exposure,

06:42.000 --> 06:42.540
you took my staff
and you went out,
risking exposure,

06:42.572 --> 06:44.000
jeopardizing us all.
And for what?

06:44.000 --> 06:44.408
jeopardizing us all.
And for what?

06:44.408 --> 06:46.000
-I hurt her and I--
-Oh, I don't doubt it.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.444
-I hurt her and I--
-Oh, I don't doubt it.

06:47.478 --> 06:48.000
You are so good
at hurting things.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
You are so good

Stop bringing up Mom.

06:53.550 --> 06:54.000
I didn't.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I didn't.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.721
I didn't.

06:56.754 --> 06:58.000
Don't passive-aggressive me.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Don't passive-aggressive me.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.190
Don't passive-aggressive me.

07:00.223 --> 07:02.000
I've proved myself.

07:02.000 --> 07:02.194
I've proved myself.

07:02.226 --> 07:04.000
The fact that
Stargirl is still alive
says the opposite.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
The fact that
Stargirl is still alive
says the opposite.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.427

07:28.000 --> 07:28.351
I didn't do anything wrong.

07:28.386 --> 07:30.000
She was in the tunnels,
Cynthia.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.488
She was in the tunnels,
Cynthia.

07:31.488 --> 07:32.000
And you left her alive.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
And you left her alive.

07:34.000 --> 07:34.324
And you left her alive.

07:34.358 --> 07:36.000
Return home.

07:36.000 --> 07:36.427
Return home.

07:36.461 --> 07:38.000
