00:02.560 --> 00:05.120
Would you want to grow up here? 
 I have to.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.520
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.520 --> 00:10.600
I was just an average kid 
 until my first day of Junior High.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.800
One minute I'm walking home, 
 the next, there's a crash

00:16.800 --> 00:19.960
and I'm drenched 
 in some weird chemical.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.240
And since then... 
 nothing's been the same.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:37.880 --> 00:40.760
My best friend Ray 
 thinks it's cool.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.400
And my sister Annie 
 thinks I'm a science project.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.640
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.720
Not even my parents.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.120
I know the Chemical Plant 
 wants to find me

00:54.120 --> 00:55.800
and turn me into some experiment.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.320
But you know something?

00:57.320 --> 01:00.880
I guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:10.040 --> 01:14.200
- What's keeping Mom and Dad? 
 - They're never late on barbecue night.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.040
Ouch!

01:24.600 --> 01:28.480
- Hey, Mom, hey, Dad. 
 - This is a very exciting day.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.240
- We have great news for Alex. 
 - It's true.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.040
Alexandra Louise Mack 
 you have been chosen

01:34.040 --> 01:37.080
Paradise Valley Chemical Plant's 
 Kid of the Month!

01:37.080 --> 01:39.920
- What's that? 
 - [Annie] It's where they pick

01:39.920 --> 01:43.280
some unsuspecting child's 
 name out of a fishbowl

01:43.280 --> 01:46.960
and give them a cheapo 
 complementary beach towel.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.480
Actually, this year, 
 it's a windbreaker.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.440
Annie, don't put it down, 
 it's very special.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.080
They do a story on the winner 
 for the company newspaper.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.160
A reporter's coming here Friday.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.400
Here?

01:59.400 --> 02:02.120
A reporter's coming here 
 to interview Alex?

02:02.120 --> 02:03.640
Wow, like a celebrity.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.920
Not quite.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.640
Come on, Annie, 
 can't you be happy for me?

02:07.640 --> 02:11.280
I'm sorry, Alex, congratulations.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.400
[Vince] 
 Flack, you've been given a job to do

02:20.400 --> 02:23.840
and up to this point, 
 Miss Atron remains unimpressed.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.640
Vince, you can't expect me 
 to go to every family in town.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.600
Of course not. 
 We have other plans if you fail.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.280
It might help if you let me know 
 exactly what to look for.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.880
I told you 
 you're looking for a child

02:37.880 --> 02:41.640
with very unique abilities or talents.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.320
I believe you'll know it 
 when you see it

02:46.320 --> 02:48.640
if you're as good as you used to be.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.440
Well, I'm better than 
 this assignment, Vince.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.440
Not lately, you're not.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.440
Oh, you did some great things 
 in the past-- so what?

02:57.440 --> 02:59.360
That's ancient history.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.080
If I find this kid, 
 I expect assurances

03:02.080 --> 03:06.080
that I'll get my old job 
 as investigative reporter back.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.280
You know, looking 
 into rival plants' projects

03:09.280 --> 03:12.440
finding dirt on Miss Atron's 
 prominent political enemies.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.480
Flack, you find this kid, 
 and I got a feeling

03:15.480 --> 03:20.080
you'll be able to write yourself 
 a ticket to any job you want.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.680
[Alex] Ooh, Mom, 
 can we get some fresh-cut flowers

03:25.680 --> 03:27.680
for when when the reporter comes?

03:27.680 --> 03:30.240
[Mrs Mack] 
 Whatever you want, honey.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.720
Are you insane or just hallucinating?

03:34.720 --> 03:36.560
What's the matter?

03:36.560 --> 03:41.560
Gee, I don't know, Alex, 
 why don't you tell me?

03:41.560 --> 03:44.400
A reporter... from the Plant... here?

03:44.400 --> 03:48.000
- What's the big deal? 
 - They picked my name at random.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.280
How do you know?

03:49.280 --> 03:51.560
Sometimes you just have 
 to trust people, Annie.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.920
You're just desperate for attention. 
 You'd better call this off.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.600
No way that's going to happen.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.720
Alex, listen to me. 
 This is really dangerous.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.880
What do you care about some 
 article from the Plant Paper, anyway?

04:05.880 --> 04:08.720
It's not like you did 
 anything to earn it.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.080
That's easy for you to say. 
 Nobody even knows I exist.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.920
Once people read this, 
 they'll notice me for a change.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.040
Okay, fine.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.959
But if this thing backfires don't 
 come running to me for help.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.080
Believe me, I won't.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.640
[sneezing] 
 Alex, you got to help me.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.200
I don't know how much longer 
 I can take this.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.280
- Ray, it's a cold. 
 - I think you'll pull through.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.760
Can't you do something? 
 You know, zap it out of me.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.560
[humming and zapping]

04:39.560 --> 04:41.480
[sneezing]

04:41.480 --> 04:43.360
Sorry, that's the best I can do.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.760
You'll have to take two aspirin 
 like everyone else.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.520
[sneezing]

04:49.520 --> 04:52.360
Hey, Raymond, 
 I'd have that taken care of.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.720
Really? 
 You think it's that serious?

04:55.720 --> 04:59.840
- Robyn, it's just a cold. 
 - My uncle Larry had just a cold.

04:59.840 --> 05:03.280
One day he was here, 
 and the next... gone.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.000
His company transferred him.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.400
That's what they want you 
 to believe.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.560
Well, I've got some good news.

05:09.560 --> 05:14.280
The Paradise Valley Chemical Plant 
 chose me as this month's kid.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.760
Nicole was the kid 
 a couple of months ago.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.040
She said a reporter 
 came to her house

05:19.040 --> 05:21.440
and asked a lot 
 of obnoxious questions.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.960
Are you sure that's not just Nicole?

05:23.960 --> 05:28.120
- She complains about everyone. 
 - I don't think so. She made it seem

05:28.120 --> 05:31.960
like he was trying to dig up 
 secrets about her entire family.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.760
I've been considering being a reporter.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.840
Alex invited me over 
 to watch this guy in action.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.440
Alex, don't tell them anything.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.880
They don't care about you. 
 They're just out to sell newspapers.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.200
By the time they're through 
 with you, you'll have no secrets.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.360
Really?

05:50.360 --> 05:53.360
Maybe this isn't 
 such a good idea after all.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.960
Relax, just be your charming self, Alex.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.680
That never works. 
 I'd rather be someone else.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.400
Like who?

06:01.400 --> 06:03.320
[horn honks]

06:15.720 --> 06:17.960
[sneezing]

06:17.960 --> 06:20.640
[laughing]

06:20.640 --> 06:23.640
- Raymond! 
 - Excuse me.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.720
[Mr Mack] 
 Are you sure I look all right?

06:26.720 --> 06:30.520
I think I'm more of a 
 double-knit-polyester type guy.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.280
There's nothing wrong with 
 looking good for the article, George

06:34.280 --> 06:37.840
and, dear, you could use 
 a little positive P.R. yourself.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.400
- [doorbell ringing] 
 - Alex, he's here!

06:41.400 --> 06:43.920
[doorbell ringing]

06:46.160 --> 06:49.480
- Oh... Raymond. 
 - Big night, huh?

06:50.760 --> 06:53.080
Um, Alex, Ray's here.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.720
- Alex? Alex? 
 - Wow!

06:59.840 --> 07:02.480
Honey, don't you think 
 you should change

07:02.480 --> 07:05.840
into those adorable 
 little culottes I bought you?

07:05.840 --> 07:08.960
- And that big, bulky sweater? 
 - Come on, you guys.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.640
This is an important night for me. 
 I want to look special.

07:12.640 --> 07:17.240
Well, if that's what 
 makes you happy... George...

07:17.240 --> 07:20.000
George, help me in the kitchen.

07:29.480 --> 07:33.000
I'm sorry, little girl, 
 we're all out of candy

07:33.000 --> 07:36.200
- but come back next halloween. 
 - I'm disappointed.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.280
I thought you'd be over 
 this jealousy thing.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.200
Yeah, I'm real jealous of 
 this little disaster in the making.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.760
If that's the way you feel about it

07:45.760 --> 07:49.160
why don't you just stay 
 upstairs the whole night?

07:49.160 --> 07:51.640
[Mrs Mack] Annie, honey, 
 go up and get changed.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.920
I really thought I'd be able to join you

07:54.920 --> 07:59.360
but I've got that big essay due 
 tomorrow and I'm not halfway done.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.040
- I think it would mean a lot to Alex... 
 - Oh, that's okay, Daddy.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.320
I understand.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.440
Let her go.

08:07.440 --> 08:11.360
Well, all right, I guess your 
 schoolwork comes first, Annie.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.200
I'm sure everything's 
 going to be just fine.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.840
[whispering]: I'll order you 
 some more fresh-cut flowers

08:18.840 --> 08:20.680
for your funeral.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.480
Another night, 
 another family, eh, Mr. Flack?

08:34.480 --> 08:36.400
This night will be different, David.

08:36.400 --> 08:40.480
I'll rip the lid off every house 
 I visit from here on in.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.799
If there's something to find out 
 I'm going to find it out.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.080
Keep alert. 
 I may need you to tape for me.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.960
You know me, always ready 
 for action when called.

08:50.960 --> 08:56.280
Good, let's hope things 
 get that interesting.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.480
Are you kids ready? 
 He'll be here any minute.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.280
I wish she would calm down.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.840
She's more excited 
 about this than I am.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.400
Give her a break, Alex.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.280
She just wants to make 
 this nice for you.

09:08.280 --> 09:12.560
I'm just so nervous about tonight. 
 I hope this reporter likes me.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.360
I hope he recognizes you. 
 Personally, I miss the old Alex.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.400
- Don't start with me, Raymond. 
 - Not a chance.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.840
I don't want to be sent 
 to my room like your sister.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.480
Ooh, Annie! 
 She makes me so furious.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.920
Always predicting some big disaster.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.840
- [doorbell rings] 
 - That's him!

09:33.840 --> 09:38.440
The evening began routinely 
 around 6:15 when the doorbell rang.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.280
Oh, hello, Mr. Flack, 
 I'm Barbara Mack.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.360
- Please come in. 
 - Barb.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.720
- Mr. Mack-- Good to meet you. 
 - Mack.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.720
[Mrs Mack] 
 Alex, come meet Gordon Flack.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.120
Gordon Flack? 
 The Gordon Flack?

09:52.120 --> 09:52.870
So?

09:53.840 --> 09:57.320
Alex, he's the down dirtiest 
 reporter in the town.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.400
You've got to be 
 really careful around him.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.360
Everything is going to be just fi...

10:05.080 --> 10:08.320
[sneezes, zapping]

10:13.480 --> 10:15.520
[tea kettle whistling]

10:15.520 --> 10:17.560
- [zapping] 
 - What the...

10:17.560 --> 10:21.680
Finally, an interesting evening.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.600
[zapping]

10:33.920 --> 10:35.920
[Ray] 
 That Flack guy is going to bust you

10:35.920 --> 10:39.640
- if you sneeze like that again. 
 - So I just won't sneeze.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.400
What if you caught my...

10:41.400 --> 10:44.000
[congested]: 
 I did not catch your cold.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.360
How do you know?

10:45.360 --> 10:47.400
Because tonight is too important.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.280
Sorry the house is such a mess.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.360
I'm sure you did your best.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.800
Ah... here she is. 
 Alex...

10:55.800 --> 10:59.680
- This is Gordon Flack. 
 - How do you do?

10:59.680 --> 11:02.360
Ray Alvarado, 
 Budding Journalist.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.560
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

11:05.560 --> 11:09.080
- I assume he's not one of yours. 
 - [Mrs Mack] Raymond...

11:09.080 --> 11:12.760
maybe Mr. Flack doesn't 
 want you to ask any questions.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.240
- Nice guess, Barb. 
 - Barbara--

11:15.240 --> 11:17.480
I prefer Barbara. 
 [laughing]

11:17.480 --> 11:19.160
Wienie?

11:20.920 --> 11:23.960
So, Gordon... 
 what brings you here?

11:23.960 --> 11:27.080
I thought you only handled 
 the big stories.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.920
Every career has its lows.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.640
I'm sure yours 
 will have many of them.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.720
You must be on some juicy story.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.200
The juiciest-- 
 but I'm not allowed to discuss it.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.120
Let's just say it's a secret 
 that will rip this town apart.

11:41.120 --> 11:45.640
A... secret? 
 In boring old Paradise Valley?

11:45.640 --> 11:48.240
[exaggerated laughing]

11:48.240 --> 11:50.000
That's a laugh.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.840
I've just got to be in 
 the right place at the right time.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.960
[sneezes, zapping]

11:57.960 --> 12:00.800
Can someone explain this to me?

12:00.800 --> 12:04.160
Maybe... static electricity 
 from the carpet.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.000
- Right. 
 - Ah.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.800
- Mini-egg roll, Gordon? 
 - [sneezes, zapping]

12:11.800 --> 12:14.200
[Mrs Mack] 
 Oh, I'm sorry! Oh...

12:14.200 --> 12:18.640
I just have got to get 
 something from the car.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.120
Uh... wait here. 
 [chuckling]

12:21.120 --> 12:23.000
I'll be right back.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.760
Um... I need something 
 from upstairs.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.440
I think it's going very well.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.320
[snoring]

12:34.320 --> 12:36.280
David! Wake up!

12:36.280 --> 12:37.360
Uh... all done?

12:37.360 --> 12:40.920
No. I want you to take 
 the camera and start shooting.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.920
Weird things are going on in there 
 and I want them on tape.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.640
You got it.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.240
Uh, Mr. Flack?

12:49.240 --> 12:52.720
Uh... which button 
 did you say was record?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.240
I've told her, I told her.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.680
Annie, I know you told her. 
 But she needs your help.

12:58.680 --> 13:02.560
She's caught my cold and now 
 her powers have gone haywire!

13:02.560 --> 13:05.000
What's going on with the reporter?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.560
He went to the car to get something.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.880
Oh, great.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.240
Now he's having 
 that Dave guy film her.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.000
Should we tell your parents?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.480
No! They'll put two 
 and two together.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.680
I'll go down and 
 keep an eye on her.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.880
You go out and take care of Dave.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.280
Please... there must be 
 something special about you.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.800
Nope! Not really.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.840
[Mr Mack] 
 Here she is.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.240
- Meet Annie, our oldest. 
 - Annie, child prodigy.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.000
I've heard all about you.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.720
Now I'm trying to find out a little 
 something about your sister, too.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.080
Mr. Flack, uh...

13:44.080 --> 13:47.120
why don't I show you 
 the rest of the house?

13:47.120 --> 13:49.720
Wherever you go, I'm following.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.400
[whispering]: 
 This is great.

14:03.800 --> 14:09.560
- Now, this is the... 
 - Let me guess-- the garage.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.760
Over here's my sister's 
 chemistry set.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.600
She's kind of a genius.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.480
Oh, I'm sure you have 
 your own special... talents.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.560
[sneezes, zapping]

14:23.320 --> 14:25.760
How did that happen?

14:25.760 --> 14:28.240
Uh... remote control.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.720
Cool, huh?

14:29.720 --> 14:31.560
If that's a remote control

14:31.560 --> 14:34.800
I assume you can also 
 stop the train with it.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.680
[zapping]

14:38.240 --> 14:40.600
- Oh. 
 - [chuckles]

14:40.600 --> 14:43.120
[sneezes, zapping]

14:44.200 --> 14:46.480
Enough with the train.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.760
[zapping]

14:54.080 --> 14:57.600
- What do you think you're doing? 
 - Uh, nothing.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.360
I'm, uh, I'm making home videos.

15:00.360 --> 15:04.320
- Oh, this is your home. 
 - Um... not exactly.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.680
Then I think I'll go in and tell them.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.280
No, wait!

15:09.280 --> 15:13.360
Look, kid, this is offical 
 Plant security business.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.040
I didn't want to involve you.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.880
Really? 
 What did they do?

15:17.880 --> 15:20.280
Nothing... yet.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.280
Give me that.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.000
You don't even have 
 the record button on.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.240
Let me see what I can get.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.440
I've decided to join the fun.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.280
Tell me some more 
 about yourself, Alex.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.640
There's not much to tell. 
 Really.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.320
Gee. I guess I should be 
 writing all this down.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.200
More lemonade, Gordon?

15:45.200 --> 15:47.000
[Flack] 
 Why not?

16:01.440 --> 16:04.200
[Flack] So, tell me-- 
 [screaming]

16:04.200 --> 16:06.320
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.400
[sneezes]

16:10.760 --> 16:13.080
[zapping]

16:13.080 --> 16:18.080
Must be some power outage 
 in the neighborhood.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.800
- How we doing? 
 - We're doing great.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.480
Where did Alex go?

16:24.480 --> 16:26.040
Maybe to check the fuses.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.880
She's the electrical wizard

16:27.880 --> 16:31.080
so I'm sure she sent to 
 straighten everything out.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.640
Something very strange 
 is going on around here.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.280
Excuse me.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.520
Hold this.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.080
Here, see what you can get.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.320
Excuse me.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.680
Excuse me. 
 Where are you going?

16:55.680 --> 17:00.120
I want to see where the 
 "Kid of the Month" lays her head.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.640
They're heading upstairs. 
 I've got to get up there.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.760
There's a ladder 
 on the side of the house.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.960
[Alex] 
 What am I going to do?

17:17.960 --> 17:20.839
- I've got to get back down. 
 - Maybe this will help.

17:20.839 --> 17:21.839
Cold medicine?

17:21.839 --> 17:24.000
Think of something more scientific.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.960
I'm not just a normal person 
 with a bad case of sniffles.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.720
- [knocking at door] 
 - [Flack] May I come in?

17:30.720 --> 17:31.840
Just a minute!

17:31.840 --> 17:35.800
It'll control your symptoms 
 until I think of something better.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.680
But with your unique 
 chemical makeup

17:38.680 --> 17:41.400
you might have 
 some weird side effects.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.640
Um, thanks for the warning.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.200
- [knocking at door] 
 - [Flack] Girls!

17:47.040 --> 17:49.920
- Stay here. 
 - Ah...

17:54.640 --> 17:55.600
...choo!

17:58.600 --> 18:00.840
[gurgling]

18:00.840 --> 18:02.440
[knocking at door]

18:02.440 --> 18:05.520
Girls? 
 What are you hiding in there?

18:05.880 --> 18:06.880
Coming!

18:06.880 --> 18:10.560
Go! Just, go under there.

18:13.320 --> 18:17.560
- You got me covered, right? 
 - You'll be fine.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.120
See you later!

18:28.120 --> 18:30.760
- Hey! Where you going? 
 - [zapping]

18:31.680 --> 18:33.520
[screaming]

18:33.520 --> 18:36.240
[loud crash]

18:42.640 --> 18:44.400
[Flack] 
 Well, let's go!

18:44.400 --> 18:46.840
- What are you hiding in there? 
 - What's up?

18:46.840 --> 18:50.520
Well, I thought Alex 
 was fixing the circuit breaker.

18:50.520 --> 18:54.160
But since she is shall we say, 
 a mediocre student

18:54.160 --> 18:57.960
and you are a chemistry genius 
 it made me wonder.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.520
Where is she?

19:02.160 --> 19:04.040
[Alex mumbles indistinctly]

19:04.040 --> 19:06.280
[gurgling]

19:10.680 --> 19:12.360
Not in here.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.560
[gurgling]

19:22.640 --> 19:25.520
So, Gordo... 
 how's the interview going?

19:25.520 --> 19:30.040
- Where is Alex? 
 - I thought she was with you.

19:31.680 --> 19:36.280
It's getting awfully chilly in here. 
 I must be getting a fever.

19:36.280 --> 19:40.160
Alex! I think you're coming 
 down with something.

19:40.160 --> 19:44.080
Let's all have dinner and then 
 Mr. Flack can be on his way.

19:44.080 --> 19:47.880
Alex, please make sure Mr. Flack 
 gets everything he needs.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.040
Come, everybody sit.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.120
Not you, George.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.560
Water, please.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.440
Sure.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.960
[softly]: 
 Ah...

20:10.160 --> 20:12.120
[sneezes loudly]

20:16.400 --> 20:19.160
[zapping]

20:19.160 --> 20:22.920
What is going on here?

20:23.200 --> 20:25.000
[Mrs Mack] 
 Alex!

20:25.000 --> 20:27.400
Your father and I 
 remember the cutest story...

20:27.400 --> 20:31.040
- Alex? 
 - She... went to get some tissue.

20:31.040 --> 20:35.480
Oh, well, while we're waiting 
 your could interview Annie, Mr. Flack.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.520
She's quite the genius, 
 you know.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.720
[softly]: 
 Hello? Hello?

20:45.680 --> 20:47.800
Tell me, dear...

20:48.560 --> 20:52.280
- does the soup talk back? 
 - [coughing and gurgling]

20:53.840 --> 20:56.280
[coughing and gurgling]

20:56.280 --> 20:58.560
[coughing]

20:58.560 --> 21:01.400
Annie? 
 Are you getting sick, too?

21:01.400 --> 21:02.760
No, I'm fine, Mom.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.960
I need to get some water 
 in the kitchen.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.920
Not so fast. 
 I never got my water.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.640
I'll get you some fresh.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.360
Nonsense! You'll run off 
 like the other one.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.680
- Give me the pitcher. 
 - No.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.560
Let Mr. Flack have the water, honey.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.960
We have more. 
 What sort of institution is this?

21:22.960 --> 21:24.120
No. Get away!

21:24.120 --> 21:26.640
- [groaning] 
 - [splashing]

21:26.640 --> 21:28.480
Annie, are you all right?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.840
- Gordon, get up. 
 - Get off me!

21:30.840 --> 21:34.200
You are completely 
 out of your minds!

21:34.200 --> 21:36.720
- Do you realize that? 
 - Wait a second, pal.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.160
You can't talk to my family like that.

21:39.160 --> 21:42.400
Yeah, he's right. 
 You apologize right now.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.240
Yeah! 
 Before somebody gets hurt.

21:45.240 --> 21:50.960
I'm sorry I ever crossed 
 your prefabricated threshold.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.320
- Satisfied? 
 - Almost.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.360
Now go.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.480
Now, leave!

22:13.160 --> 22:15.800
Oh, we got some 
 great stuff, Mr. Flack.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.240
Forget it, David. 
 I can't take this town anymore.

22:19.240 --> 22:24.240
It's time for me to give up this 
 game and go write my memoirs.

22:26.640 --> 22:30.440
Raymond, come on. 
 I can hardly see the board.

22:30.440 --> 22:34.240
I'm not taking any chances 
 on those germs revisiting me.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.600
I'll move your men. 
 Don't worry, I won't cheat.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.960
Ray, I'm sick, not stupid.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.000
Wow!

22:53.000 --> 22:54.720
Your move.

22:54.720 --> 22:58.440
- Did you guys see the paper? 
 - Can you believe it?

22:58.440 --> 23:01.080
"Due to an error in 
 the selection process

23:01.080 --> 23:05.000
"there will be no "Kid of 
 the Month" in this issue.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.920
"The chronicle also says 
 good-bye to Gordon Flack

23:07.920 --> 23:10.560
"who has left to pursue 
 other interests."

23:10.560 --> 23:12.800
- [Ray, Annie laughing] 
 - [sneezes]

23:12.800 --> 23:14.440
[zapping]

23:14.440 --> 23:16.960
[Annie] 
 Whatever gave him the idea

23:16.960 --> 23:20.280
that there was a secret 
 in Paradise Valley?
