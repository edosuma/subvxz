00:10.011 --> 00:11.510
<i>¶ A hideaway at sea </i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.145

00:13.147 --> 00:14.613

00:30.498 --> 00:33.465
<i>¶ Come along</i>
<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:35.200

<i>- Ahoy!</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:36.735

00:57.624 --> 00:59.091
Yo-ho, let's go!

00:59.093 --> 01:00.659
Ha-har!

01:02.195 --> 01:03.762
Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.764 --> 01:06.398
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.600 --> 01:08.834
Great!

01:08.836 --> 01:10.502
To start
today's adventure,

01:10.504 --> 01:13.238
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:13.240 --> 01:15.207
Yo-ho-ho!

01:15.209 --> 01:18.410
- [all] Yo-ho-ho!
- One more time!

01:18.412 --> 01:20.179
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:24.517 --> 01:26.819
[Jake] Jake and the Beanstalk.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.821
[Izzy]
Almost done, Jake!

01:28.823 --> 01:30.589
Just hold still!

01:30.591 --> 01:33.459
My painting of you
is looking shipshape!

01:33.461 --> 01:34.860
And colorful too!

01:34.862 --> 01:36.795
[gasp]
Coconuts!

01:36.797 --> 01:39.231
[Cubby]
Jake! You're vest is glowing!

01:39.866 --> 01:42.101
Huh? Whoa!

01:42.103 --> 01:44.303
I never even knew
I had this pocket!

01:44.704 --> 01:46.171
Or this!

01:46.173 --> 01:48.240
It's beans.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.475
And check out this note.

01:49.477 --> 01:53.145
"Ahoy, it's Peter Pan
with a message for you.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.247
Here's something
fun for you to do.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.749
Plant these magic
beans and watch them grow.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.618
Then look for
the Golden Treasure."

01:59.620 --> 02:01.220
Yo-ho, let's go!

02:01.222 --> 02:03.822
"But be careful how
long you look around.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.259
You gotta get back to Pirate
Island before sundown!"

02:07.261 --> 02:09.394
Well, then
let's get plantin'!

02:13.600 --> 02:15.267
Aw, beans!

02:15.269 --> 02:16.902
Nothing is happening!

02:16.904 --> 02:19.638
Maybe they just
need a little water.

02:22.742 --> 02:25.344
That's it?
One puny plant?

02:27.347 --> 02:28.614
[all] Huh?

02:28.616 --> 02:31.183
[Skully] Yo-ho,
thar she grows!

02:31.185 --> 02:33.652
And grows and grows!

02:34.721 --> 02:37.456
[Izzy] Shiver me
giant timbers!

02:37.458 --> 02:40.259
Do you think
something is up there?

02:40.261 --> 02:42.227
Well, Peter said,

02:42.229 --> 02:45.230
"Plant these magic beans
and watch them grow...

02:45.232 --> 02:47.332
...then look for the
Golden Treasure!"

02:47.334 --> 02:50.269
[gasps]
I bet this beanstalk
takes us right to it!

02:50.271 --> 02:51.637
Mateys,

02:51.639 --> 02:53.839
want to climb the Giant
Beanstalk with us

02:53.841 --> 02:55.908
and find the golden treasure?

02:57.477 --> 03:01.313
Great! Remember to keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.549
Whenever we solve a
Pirate Problem together,

03:03.551 --> 03:04.750
they'll appear.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.251
Then we'll collect 'em

03:06.253 --> 03:08.287
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.322
Is everybody ready?

03:10.324 --> 03:11.323
I got my sword!

03:11.325 --> 03:12.824
I got my map!

03:12.826 --> 03:15.227
And I've got
my pixie dust!

03:15.229 --> 03:16.628
The fairies
gave it to me

03:16.630 --> 03:18.730
so that we can
use it to fly!

03:18.732 --> 03:20.666
But only in emergencies!

03:20.668 --> 03:23.936
Yo-ho, let's go
climb the beanstalk!

03:27.273 --> 03:30.342
<i>¶ Yo-ho mateys, away! </i>

03:30.344 --> 03:32.511
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today! ¶</i>

03:32.513 --> 03:33.812
<i>¶ Let's go! </i>

03:33.814 --> 03:35.480
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go </i>

03:35.482 --> 03:37.282
<i>¶ Together as a team </i>

03:37.284 --> 03:40.252
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

03:40.254 --> 03:42.254
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:44.857 --> 03:47.326
[Hook]
Fie and fish scales!

03:47.328 --> 03:52.397
Mr. Smee, I haven't seen any
treasure or adventure for days.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.434
Gallopin' Galleons!
Spy that!

03:55.436 --> 03:57.436
[Bones]
Boil me, barnacles!

03:57.438 --> 04:00.539
That's the biggest
weed I ever did see!

04:00.541 --> 04:02.708
That's no weed, Bones.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.743
That's
a giant beanstalk.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.580
Why it reminds me
of a delightful story

04:08.582 --> 04:10.282
I heard as a wee lad.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.450
[groan]

04:11.452 --> 04:13.986
Not another one
of your fairy tales!

04:13.988 --> 04:16.955
Oh, you'll like this one, cap'n!

04:16.957 --> 04:19.291
There once was a
big ol' beanstalk

04:19.293 --> 04:23.295
and it led to a land
of amazing treasure.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.763
Amazing treasure?

04:24.765 --> 04:28.467
Aye! Why, there was even
a goose that laid golden eggs.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.801
[laughs]

04:29.803 --> 04:33.305
Men, set sail
for Pirate Island.

04:33.307 --> 04:36.275
We're climbin'
us a beanstalk!

04:38.378 --> 04:41.346
Whoa!
Aw, coconuts!

04:41.348 --> 04:43.815
This beanstalk
isn't easy to climb!

04:43.817 --> 04:47.419
Uh-oh! We need something
for Cubby to grab onto

04:47.421 --> 04:48.754
so we can pull him up!

04:48.756 --> 04:50.355
I've got an idea!

04:50.357 --> 04:52.291
This vine
can help Cubby.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.359
Going up!

04:55.361 --> 04:57.329
Thanks for the lift,
mateys!

04:57.331 --> 05:00.565
Yay-hey! We used a
vine to lift Cubby

05:00.567 --> 05:02.567
and we got two
gold doubloons!

05:02.569 --> 05:04.803
Let's grab 'em and go

05:04.805 --> 05:06.571
up the beanstalk!

05:09.676 --> 05:11.710
- Whoa!
- Wow!

05:11.712 --> 05:13.745
It's a big
Cloud Island!

05:13.747 --> 05:15.714
Who do you think
lives up here?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.582
[Jake] Come on,
Let's check it out!

05:17.584 --> 05:19.518
Blast!

05:19.520 --> 05:21.887
Again with those
puny pirates!

05:21.889 --> 05:24.790
How did they get here first?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.358
Look alive,
me hearties!

05:26.360 --> 05:29.561
I think thar's gold
in them thar hills!

05:29.563 --> 05:35.334
Y'hear that?
There be gold up ahead!
Oh, climb lively, lads.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.536
Climbin' Cap'n!

05:41.040 --> 05:44.376
[Izzy] The golden glow
is coming from over here.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.379
So that's who
lives up here.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.481
A golden crocodile!

05:49.483 --> 05:52.484
[Cubby]
That lays golden eggs!

05:53.986 --> 05:55.754
This must be
the golden treasure

05:55.756 --> 05:57.456
that Peter wanted
us to find!

05:59.025 --> 06:03.128
Aw! That Golden Croc sure
loves her little babies!

06:03.130 --> 06:04.996
Just imagine...

06:04.998 --> 06:07.499
If I had that
Golden Croc,

06:07.501 --> 06:11.403
I'd have all the
golden eggs I want!

06:11.405 --> 06:14.506
Uh, Cap'n, you don't
really like crocodiles,

06:14.508 --> 06:15.774
even gold ones.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.477
And they don't like you!

06:18.479 --> 06:19.778
Good point, Mr. Smee.

06:19.780 --> 06:24.516
That's why I want you
to fetch her for me.

06:25.753 --> 06:30.922
Looks like Hook's crew is trying
to steal the Golden Croc!

06:30.924 --> 06:32.491
Captain Hook!

06:32.493 --> 06:34.426
I wouldn't do that
if I were you!

06:34.428 --> 06:37.796
Because you're such a
goody-goody-do-gooder?

06:37.798 --> 06:39.564
Because it's never smart

06:39.566 --> 06:42.401
to mess with a mom
who's protecting her eggs.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.936
Especially a crocodile mom!

06:44.938 --> 06:46.638
[snarl]

06:50.009 --> 06:51.143
[roar]

06:52.745 --> 06:54.579
Save me, Smee!

06:54.581 --> 06:59.518
Oh my! That's one cranky
croc! What'll we do?!

07:00.520 --> 07:01.987
Hey, look at this!

07:01.989 --> 07:05.891
We can hide atop this
harpy lookin' flower.

07:05.893 --> 07:09.161
You know, a wise
old pirate once said:

07:09.163 --> 07:12.964
"Music be soothin'
the savagest of beasties."

07:12.966 --> 07:15.100
Oh!
Which means...?

07:15.102 --> 07:19.504
[Smee] It means a little
music might calm the croc down.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.906
Hit it, Bones!

07:20.908 --> 07:23.708
<i>¶ Golden croc o' mine </i>

07:23.710 --> 07:27.446
<i>¶ Listen to our sleepy song </i>

07:27.448 --> 07:30.482
<i>¶ Curl up where you're at </i>

07:30.484 --> 07:33.218
<i>¶ Have a snoozy croco-nap </i>

07:33.220 --> 07:34.719
[snoring]

07:34.721 --> 07:37.722
I say we forget
the big mama

07:37.724 --> 07:42.828
and come to Papa, me little
golden eggy-weggies!

07:46.566 --> 07:49.634
Hook! Those eggs
don't belong to you!

07:50.036 --> 07:51.536
They do now!

07:51.538 --> 07:52.170
[gasp]

07:53.172 --> 07:54.706
[roar]

07:54.708 --> 07:57.542
Bust me, barnacles!

07:57.544 --> 08:00.011
The Cap'n is
in trouble, boys!

08:00.013 --> 08:02.814
Perhaps another
"plucky" song?

08:04.617 --> 08:07.152
We've gotta get those eggs
back to the Golden Croc.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.654
Yo-ho, let's go!

08:10.590 --> 08:12.524
Codfish!
Dead ahead!

08:12.526 --> 08:15.560
[Hook] Whoa, ho-ho-ho!

08:16.662 --> 08:18.597
Hook, just give the eggs back,

08:18.599 --> 08:20.932
and the Golden Croc
will stop chasing you!

08:20.934 --> 08:22.200
Never!

08:22.202 --> 08:23.235
[snarl]

08:23.237 --> 08:24.603
[screams]

08:28.774 --> 08:30.775
Oh, dear, oh, dear!

08:30.777 --> 08:32.210
Avast, mates!

08:32.212 --> 08:33.979
The cap'n's done
scuttled

08:33.981 --> 08:35.981
right off the side
o'the island!

08:35.983 --> 08:39.885
The mommy croc, too!
This is an emergency!

08:39.887 --> 08:42.554
Then I've got
just the thing!

08:42.556 --> 08:44.656
Pixie dust away!

08:46.025 --> 08:48.093
[screaming]

08:50.897 --> 08:53.098
Don't worry,
you're all safe now!

08:55.535 --> 08:56.701
Yay-hey!

08:56.703 --> 08:58.570
We saved Hook
and the Golden Croc

08:58.572 --> 09:00.939
and we got four more
gold doubloons!

09:00.941 --> 09:03.942
Let's grab 'em and go
back to Cloud Island!

09:07.213 --> 09:08.780
Oh, Cap'n!

09:08.782 --> 09:10.849
You're still
in one piece!

09:10.851 --> 09:12.584
Of course, I am!

09:12.586 --> 09:14.219
Now let's get
out of here

09:14.221 --> 09:16.821
before that croc
comes back for her...

09:17.657 --> 09:18.723
What?

09:19.959 --> 09:21.226
Mama!

09:22.828 --> 09:25.130
Glad we could help
you get your eggs...

09:25.132 --> 09:27.198
...I mean,
your babies back!

09:27.200 --> 09:29.701
[cooing]

09:31.971 --> 09:34.072
Aw, crocodiles.

09:34.074 --> 09:34.739
[rumbling]

09:34.741 --> 09:35.674
Huh?

09:35.676 --> 09:37.676
Crackers! What's going on?!

09:37.678 --> 09:39.578
Remember Peter's warning?

09:39.580 --> 09:42.013
"Be careful how
long you look around,

09:42.015 --> 09:43.815
you've got to get
back to Pirate Island

09:43.817 --> 09:45.650
before sundown!"

09:45.652 --> 09:47.719
And the sun
is going down!

09:47.721 --> 09:49.721
Yo-ho, let's go!

09:50.356 --> 09:52.924
The vine is starting
to shrink!

09:52.926 --> 09:54.326
Now how can
we get down

09:54.328 --> 09:56.828
the beanstalk
before it disappears?

09:56.830 --> 10:00.599
I know!
We can use these big
leaves like sleds!

10:00.601 --> 10:01.766
Come on!

10:02.368 --> 10:03.768
Yeah!

10:04.236 --> 10:05.737
- Weee!
- Yo-ho!

10:05.739 --> 10:07.939
- Woo-hoo!
- Yay!

10:07.941 --> 10:11.309
- Wa-hoo!
- Wow!

10:12.178 --> 10:13.912
[Skully]
Home sweet piratey home!

10:13.914 --> 10:14.980
Wee!

10:15.381 --> 10:16.815
Yay-hey!

10:16.817 --> 10:18.617
We slid down the beanstalk

10:18.619 --> 10:21.386
and we got four
more gold doubloons!

10:21.388 --> 10:23.288
Let's grab 'em and go!

10:23.923 --> 10:26.758
[laughing]

10:39.171 --> 10:40.138
Wow!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.740
Thanks for helping us save

10:41.742 --> 10:43.775
the Golden Croc's
golden eggs, mateys.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.744
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

10:45.746 --> 10:48.113
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

10:55.688 --> 10:56.655
<i>¶ Way hey </i>

10:56.657 --> 10:59.791
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do! ¶</i>

10:59.793 --> 11:00.759
<i>¶ Way hey </i>

11:00.761 --> 11:01.760
<i>¶ With help from you </i>

11:01.762 --> 11:02.961
<i>¶ It's time to count </i>

11:02.963 --> 11:04.429
<i>¶ Our gold doubloons! </i>

11:05.131 --> 11:07.098
Come on, count with us!

11:08.034 --> 11:09.701
[all] Yeah!

11:10.970 --> 11:12.804
[Cubby] One, two,

11:12.806 --> 11:16.041
three, four, five, six.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.778
[Izzy]
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

11:19.780 --> 11:22.681
For solving
pirate problems today,

11:22.683 --> 11:25.283
we got ten gold doubloons!

11:25.285 --> 11:28.019
[voice]
Fee, Fie, Foe, Fum!

11:28.021 --> 11:31.022
I'm from Cloud Island
and here I come!

11:31.024 --> 11:32.424
Ah, coconuts!

11:32.426 --> 11:35.827
It's another giant
golden crocodile!

11:35.829 --> 11:37.829
Nope, it's just me.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.698
But I've got
a giant shadow!

11:39.700 --> 11:42.967
And a giant appetite
for crackers!

11:42.969 --> 11:46.304
[laughs]

11:48.040 --> 11:49.407
Well, boys...

11:49.409 --> 11:51.076
...we didn't get
any treasure today,

11:51.078 --> 11:54.813
but at least we're safely
back on the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

11:54.815 --> 11:57.348
What a happy
fairy-tale end!

11:57.350 --> 11:59.017
[Hook] Speak for yourself.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.419
That bumpy ride
down the beanstalk

12:01.421 --> 12:03.455
left me with
a sore end!

12:04.290 --> 12:05.857
[moan]

12:06.926 --> 12:09.360
Oh, save some ice
for me, Cap'n!

12:15.401 --> 12:17.802
[Izzy] Little Red Riding Hook.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.809
[Jake] Yo-ho, way to go, Patch!

12:24.811 --> 12:26.211
Good boy!

12:26.213 --> 12:28.213
You're an awesome
treasure hunter!

12:28.215 --> 12:29.380
[barks]

12:33.986 --> 12:36.855
Woo-hoo!
Now that's a treasure!

12:38.290 --> 12:41.493
Cool! This collar
is perfect for Patch.

12:41.495 --> 12:42.994
[howling]

12:42.996 --> 12:43.762
[barks]

12:44.764 --> 12:45.997
Sounds like
your puppy pals

12:45.999 --> 12:47.532
are calling
you home, Patch.

12:49.001 --> 12:51.970
Have fun with your
pirate puppy crew, Patch!

12:53.005 --> 12:54.773
Yo-ho, oh, no!

12:54.775 --> 12:56.908
Patch didn't take
his little treasures.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.877
Guess we'll have
to bring them to him.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.512
Here's a basket
for you, Izzy.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.781
You can put Patch's
stuff in here.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.816
Thanks, Cubby.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.184
Mateys, would you
like to help me

13:06.186 --> 13:08.787
bring the basket
of treasure to Patch?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.323
Yay-hey!

13:12.325 --> 13:15.260
Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.796
Whenever we solve a
Pirate Problem together,

13:17.798 --> 13:18.797
they'll appear.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.098
Then we'll collect 'em,

13:20.100 --> 13:22.233
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.802
You go on ahead, Izzy.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.937
We're gonna make sure
that Patch didn't leave

13:25.939 --> 13:27.272
anything else
behind on the beach.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.339
Aye-aye!

13:30.476 --> 13:33.878
<i>¶ Yo-ho mateys away </i>

13:33.880 --> 13:34.979
<i>¶ There'll be treasure </i>

13:34.981 --> 13:36.080
<i>¶ And adventure today! </i>

13:36.082 --> 13:37.315
Let's go!

13:37.317 --> 13:38.950
<i>¶ Heave ho here we go </i>

13:38.952 --> 13:40.885
<i>¶ Together as a team </i>

13:40.887 --> 13:43.888
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:43.890 --> 13:45.423
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:48.294 --> 13:50.161
[Hook]
Can you believe this?

13:50.163 --> 13:52.363
The pirate lass
is bringing

13:52.365 --> 13:56.000
a basket of treasure
to that mangy mutt!

13:56.002 --> 13:58.436
Very thoughtful
of her, isn't it!

13:58.438 --> 14:00.071
Bilge water!

14:00.073 --> 14:02.307
Dogs can't
appreciate treasure.

14:02.309 --> 14:06.911
But pirate captains can!
Now push on, Smee!

14:06.913 --> 14:10.448
Soon little busy Izzy will
give me the pup's treasure,

14:10.450 --> 14:14.853
without her realizing
that she gave it to me!

14:14.855 --> 14:16.020
[laughs]

14:16.022 --> 14:18.556
Ha-ha, indeed.

14:19.225 --> 14:19.958
I mean...

14:19.960 --> 14:21.092
Oh, my!

14:23.128 --> 14:25.196
<i>¶ A tisket, a tasket </i>

14:25.198 --> 14:27.031
¶ I'm bringing Patch a basket

14:27.033 --> 14:28.566
<i>¶ A tisket, a tasket </i>

14:28.568 --> 14:29.567
<i>¶ I'm bringing Patch a... </i>

14:29.569 --> 14:30.602
[heavy snoring]

14:35.274 --> 14:37.942
Oh, hello, little girl!

14:37.944 --> 14:39.611
I'm sorry
if I woke you, ma'am.

14:39.613 --> 14:42.881
But I was just delivering
this basket to my friend.

14:42.883 --> 14:46.150
Oh, my dear,
I can hardly see you.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.453
Could you please come closer,

14:48.455 --> 14:51.289
so I can better see
your basket of treasure...

14:51.291 --> 14:53.358
...I mean, goodies?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.492
[laughs]

14:54.494 --> 14:56.494
Shiver me timbers!

14:56.496 --> 14:59.564
What a big moustache you have!

14:59.566 --> 15:04.102
Oh, some say I look just
like me dear ol' mum.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.671
She had a moustache, too!

15:06.673 --> 15:08.506
Hmmmm...

15:08.508 --> 15:11.209
What a big
voice you have!

15:13.012 --> 15:17.682
Oh, that's just a little
cold I caught out at sea.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.250
[sneezes]

15:19.252 --> 15:22.053
Oh my, now where
is that hanky?

15:22.055 --> 15:24.689
And what a big
hook you have!

15:25.491 --> 15:26.925
Hook?

15:26.927 --> 15:30.995
All the better to hook
your basket of treasure!

15:33.532 --> 15:35.667
You sneaky snook!

15:35.669 --> 15:39.103
Mr. Smee!
Me fishing rod-hook!

15:40.673 --> 15:42.941
Yay-hey, no way!

15:44.043 --> 15:48.579
[laughs] Thank you for the
basket of treasure, puny pirate!

15:49.515 --> 15:51.950
Toodle-loo!
[laughs]

15:54.954 --> 15:57.588
Flappin' feathers!
You OK, Izzy?

15:57.590 --> 16:00.558
I'm fine.
But Patch's
basket isn't!

16:00.560 --> 16:03.294
And I'm not gonna let
Captain Hook stop me

16:03.296 --> 16:06.064
from getting Patch's
treasures back to him!

16:06.066 --> 16:09.233
You heard Izzy!
Yo-ho, let's go!

16:12.037 --> 16:14.105
[Hook] Blast! I can
hear the pitter-patter

16:14.107 --> 16:16.040
of puny pirate
footsteps behind us.

16:16.042 --> 16:19.210
And you know how
I hate pitter-patter!

16:19.212 --> 16:21.079
All too well, sir.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.081
Oh, look, captain!

16:23.083 --> 16:24.549
A bamboo shack!

16:24.551 --> 16:27.151
Maybe we can rest
there a bit and...

16:27.987 --> 16:29.988
We'll take cover here!

16:31.657 --> 16:34.392
Sounds to me like someone
found a place to hide.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.761
And that someone
is Old Feather Hat!

16:38.063 --> 16:40.098
Come on out, Captain Hook!

16:40.100 --> 16:43.501
I want Patch's
basket back!

16:43.503 --> 16:47.071
They found us!
We might as well go.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.407
We are not
going anywhere!

16:49.409 --> 16:51.409
Rusty buckets!

16:51.411 --> 16:56.180
If Hook's not coming out, how
am I gonna get the basket back?

16:56.182 --> 16:59.183
I know how we can
get Hook to come out.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.252
Let's blow that
bamboo house down!

17:04.089 --> 17:06.057
[Hook muffled] Blast.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.693
Yo-ho, way to go!

17:08.695 --> 17:11.162
We blew down the
house of bamboo sticks

17:11.164 --> 17:13.531
and we got two gold doubloons!

17:13.533 --> 17:17.235
Let's grab 'em and go get
Patch's basket of treasure!

17:18.604 --> 17:22.340
Captain Hook, will you please
give me the basket back?

17:22.342 --> 17:24.175
[Hook] ¶ A tisket a tasket

17:24.177 --> 17:27.211
<i>¶ You're not getting</i>
<i>back this basket ¶</i>

17:29.214 --> 17:30.415
Ta-ta!

17:30.417 --> 17:32.784
Sorry, but you know
how the captain gets

17:32.786 --> 17:35.153
when he doesn't get
what he wants...

17:35.155 --> 17:37.221
...and he wants
everything!

17:37.223 --> 17:40.725
Yeah, specially if it's
someone else's treasure!

17:40.727 --> 17:44.162
[Hook] Why, that's me
greatest pleasure!

17:44.164 --> 17:45.229
[laughing]

17:48.700 --> 17:49.434
Oh, my...

17:49.436 --> 17:52.270
Oh, dear!

17:52.272 --> 17:56.107
Smee, this isn't working.
You're slowing me down.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.342
Beg pardon, sir. But...

17:58.344 --> 18:01.746
I really don't have
anywhere else to go, but...

18:05.784 --> 18:06.851
...down!

18:09.688 --> 18:13.524
[Skully]
Crashin' Crackers! I think Old
Feather Hat crashed this way!

18:13.526 --> 18:14.692
Blast!

18:14.694 --> 18:16.394
Don't those
pee-wee pests

18:16.396 --> 18:19.097
have anything better
to do than bother me?

18:19.099 --> 18:22.333
- I'm afraid not, cap...
- Maybe we can hide in that hut.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.135
Follow me!

18:26.538 --> 18:28.573
Ahoy!
Is anyone home?

18:29.475 --> 18:31.509
Come, Smee.
The place is all ours.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.177
But, cap'n...

18:34.480 --> 18:37.782
...I think someone
else lives here.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.151
Well, they just
got company...

18:40.153 --> 18:41.252
...us!

18:44.189 --> 18:45.456
[rumbling]

18:45.458 --> 18:47.158
Oh, dear!
Someone's coming!

18:47.160 --> 18:48.759
It could be...

18:48.761 --> 18:50.194
...the bears!

18:50.196 --> 18:53.431
Hide, Smee!
Hide!

18:55.501 --> 18:57.702
I bet Hook's
hiding in here.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.338
How can we get
him out this time?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.240
I'm sure there's
a way, Cubby!

19:05.544 --> 19:07.812
Hmmm, bears live here.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.314
So, let's pretend
we're bears.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.482
Like this!

19:11.484 --> 19:13.718
[deep voice]
Shiver me bear claws!

19:13.720 --> 19:16.254
Who's been eating
me pirate pudding?

19:16.256 --> 19:17.421
[roar]

19:17.423 --> 19:20.892
And who's been
sitting in me chair?

19:20.894 --> 19:25.263
And who's been
sleeping in me bed?

19:25.265 --> 19:26.731
[roars]

19:26.733 --> 19:28.166
Bears!

19:28.567 --> 19:30.334
[screaming]

19:31.503 --> 19:34.305
All right!
We got Hook out of hiding!

19:34.307 --> 19:36.674
And we got three
more gold doubloons!

19:36.676 --> 19:40.244
Let's grab 'em and go
after that sneaky snook!

19:43.382 --> 19:45.783
Step lively, Smee!
Step...

19:45.785 --> 19:46.784
Stop!

19:47.920 --> 19:49.187
Whoa!

19:52.624 --> 19:55.193
It's time you
gave up, Hook!

19:55.195 --> 19:57.595
Captain Hook
never gives up!

19:57.597 --> 20:00.231
Take another step
and I'll toss your basket

20:00.233 --> 20:02.233
into this bottomless pit.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.303
Yay-hey,
that's not fair!

20:05.305 --> 20:06.504
[agitated barking]

20:08.974 --> 20:10.841
Excuse me, captain,

20:10.843 --> 20:13.844
but it seems we have
a few pups on our tail!

20:14.446 --> 20:15.680
[barking]

20:15.682 --> 20:16.781
[ripping]

20:17.716 --> 20:18.883

20:18.885 --> 20:22.653
Blasted mutts!
All of them!

20:22.655 --> 20:25.289
Run, Smee... Run!

20:25.857 --> 20:27.291
Get back here!

20:28.694 --> 20:29.961
[Cubby]
Here we come!

20:29.963 --> 20:30.695
[barking]

20:31.997 --> 20:33.598
[screaming]

20:35.634 --> 20:37.301
Aw, coconuts!

20:37.303 --> 20:38.502
The pups are in trouble!

20:38.504 --> 20:41.005
Captain Hook
and Mr. Smee, too!

20:41.007 --> 20:44.408
Captain! A cliff!
Dead ahead!

20:44.410 --> 20:47.345
That adds up to
one big emergency!

20:47.347 --> 20:49.413
Pixie dust away!

20:52.751 --> 20:55.653
Thank Izzy.
We're flying!

20:55.655 --> 20:57.288
[laughs]

20:57.290 --> 21:02.360
Yo-ho! We saved the pups,
Captain Hook, Mr. Smee,

21:02.362 --> 21:04.395
and the basket of treasure!

21:04.397 --> 21:07.398
And we got four
more gold doubloons.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.433
Let's grab 'em and go!

21:11.303 --> 21:13.304
[barking]

21:13.306 --> 21:15.773
Blasted mutts!

21:15.775 --> 21:17.441
[Izzy] Here, Patch!

21:17.443 --> 21:20.678
It's all the treasure
you found today.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.313
[happy bark]

21:22.315 --> 21:24.048
Aw, you silly pup!

21:28.620 --> 21:30.855
Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!

21:30.857 --> 21:34.292
Thanks for helping us bring
Patch his basket of treasure!

21:34.294 --> 21:36.360
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

21:36.362 --> 21:38.296
into our Team
Treasure Chest!
