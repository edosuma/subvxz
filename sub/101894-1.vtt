12:15.177 --> 12:16.973

12:16.973 --> 12:18.731
(soft hiphop music)

12:18.731 --> 12:21.905
I stopped over at
granny's house early too.

12:21.905 --> 12:23.322

12:24.294 --> 12:25.627

ain't never been that type.

12:44.506 --> 12:47.146
I've been a school boy
basketball playing type.

- [Shakia] Nah Kio, so why
this bitch call my phone?

15:01.925 --> 15:04.943
- I told her I don't want your nigga.

15:04.943 --> 15:07.231
I just need him to pay a couple of bills,

15:07.231 --> 15:12.072
and let me ride his face
from time to time (laughs).

15:12.072 --> 15:14.512
- You did not say that
to that girl Tameka.

15:14.512 --> 15:15.733
- The hell I didn't.

15:15.733 --> 15:17.163
She called my phone.

15:17.163 --> 15:19.125
So I let him know what's up,

15:19.125 --> 15:22.291
but she didn't have no business
calling my phone always.

15:22.291 --> 15:24.126
She need to be checking her nigga.

15:24.126 --> 15:27.071
Cause he showed him it's
your home where we met.

15:27.071 --> 15:29.654
- Boom, you got a point though.

15:32.580 --> 15:36.389
- So anyways, what's up with you though.

15:36.389 --> 15:38.540
I see you back at the crib.

15:38.540 --> 15:40.488
That nigga must had a magic stick

15:40.488 --> 15:45.488
cause there aint no way I'd be
back up in this motherfucker.

15:48.679 --> 15:51.297
- The heart wants what it wants, right?

15:51.297 --> 15:52.130
I mean,

15:53.145 --> 15:55.025
I love that nigga,

15:55.025 --> 15:56.942
and I know he loves me.

15:57.849 --> 16:01.182
I just need him to get his shit together

16:02.387 --> 16:03.637
when he's good,

16:04.809 --> 16:08.309
it aint nothing better, but when he's bad.

16:16.156 --> 16:17.806
- I get it girl,

16:17.806 --> 16:21.526
and nothing wrong with having
a nigga to call you on.

16:21.526 --> 16:23.867
If he do it right by you,

16:23.867 --> 16:25.973
I ain't got nothing but love for him.

16:25.973 --> 16:29.596
But if I see another one of these,

16:29.596 --> 16:31.346
oh we fucking him up.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.515
(car engine roaring)

16:47.229 --> 16:48.896
- Check me out, cuz.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.610

16:53.419 --> 16:56.149
Hold on, is this you rapping?

16:56.149 --> 16:59.333
- Nah, I aint no rapping,

16:59.333 --> 17:01.333

17:02.622 --> 17:03.539

17:04.638 --> 17:05.471

17:19.962 --> 17:21.311

17:21.311 --> 17:24.267

17:26.555 --> 17:29.224
It's perfect for me though

17:29.224 --> 17:31.616

17:43.292 --> 17:45.792
- But at the same time though,

17:47.330 --> 17:50.704
I can make as much money as I wanna make.

17:50.704 --> 17:53.532
I just gotta go out

17:53.532 --> 17:56.391
It's out there for me though.

You forgot to mention y'all
was going to the strip club.

21:43.186 --> 21:45.764

21:45.764 --> 21:47.129
I told you I was taking Jahmal out

22:04.390 --> 22:06.689
- While your ass tripping

22:06.689 --> 22:08.481
I had an epiphany last night baby.

22:08.481 --> 22:09.711
(Shakia laughs)

22:09.711 --> 22:11.090
- In a strip club?

22:11.090 --> 22:13.219
(Shakia laughs)

22:13.219 --> 22:14.431
- Whatever crazy ass.

22:14.431 --> 22:17.535

22:17.535 --> 22:19.868
Nuh, but really shit though.

22:21.268 --> 22:23.855
Jahmal been doing some camera work.

22:23.855 --> 22:24.915
And he showed me some videos

22:24.915 --> 22:27.938
he shot for some of his homeboys.

22:27.938 --> 22:30.355
That shit look real good too.

22:31.538 --> 22:34.898
I figured if I put some money behind him,

22:34.898 --> 22:38.315
lil cuz could start shooting some movies.

22:43.454 --> 22:44.287
Babe?

22:45.879 --> 22:47.212
I'm serious now.

22:48.669 --> 22:50.919
What if this is my way out.

22:53.765 --> 22:57.461
I never even thought about
that shit till last night.

22:57.461 --> 23:00.208
And I thought you had to be
(indistinct) with all that.

23:00.208 --> 23:01.501
- Sounds good.

23:01.501 --> 23:03.726
That mean I'm going to be in movies?

23:03.726 --> 23:04.836
- Of course.

23:04.836 --> 23:06.214

23:06.214 --> 23:07.934
With your fine ass

23:16.142 --> 23:17.760
- You asked for it (indistinct)

23:17.760 --> 23:22.760
You still came home smelling
like cheap ass stripper dancers

23:23.970 --> 23:25.909
(hiphop music)

23:25.909 --> 23:26.824
- [Man] What up nigga.

23:26.824 --> 23:27.849
- [Sean] What up nigga man.

23:27.849 --> 23:28.682

35:21.446 --> 35:23.627
- Damn for a laptop?

35:23.627 --> 35:25.806

35:25.806 --> 35:28.252

35:28.252 --> 35:29.968
If I had bought this

38:22.654 --> 38:24.987
What y'all got so in common?

38:26.232 --> 38:29.822

38:29.822 --> 38:33.049
I showed him some of the
videos I've been shooting.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.620
Then he just wanted to get involved.

38:34.620 --> 38:36.209
(Grandma laughs)

38:36.209 --> 38:38.581
- I love my grandchildren,

38:38.581 --> 38:41.730
but I know some better than I know others.

38:41.730 --> 38:45.018
Sean, he's been a lot
of things in his life,

38:45.018 --> 38:48.458

41:46.731 --> 41:51.062
Man, you say you wanna make movies, right?

am, the further I get.

52:19.238 --> 52:23.986
I remember when I first
started shooting videos,

52:23.986 --> 52:28.047
I knew this is what I
wanted to do with my life.

52:28.047 --> 52:31.234

52:33.376 --> 52:35.804
You know what I'm saying?

52:35.804 --> 52:39.887

is really from the hood

52:41.575 --> 52:43.927

ain't got no plans of getting out.

52:58.595 --> 53:01.595
- Well what that got to do with you?

53:03.705 --> 53:06.407
- I can't be in no
career of shooting videos

53:06.407 --> 53:08.074
for no local artists

53:09.356 --> 53:10.607

53:10.607 --> 53:13.887

53:13.887 --> 53:16.804
