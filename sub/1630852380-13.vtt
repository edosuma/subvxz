WEBVTT

00:10.445 --> 00:11.881
It's a doctor's
office, Fallon.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.665
Okay? I feel like you can break
your "no sweatpants

00:13.709 --> 00:15.580
outside of the bedroom"
rule just this once.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.887
Some rules aren't meant
to be broken,

00:17.930 --> 00:19.323
and I canceled the appointment anyway.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.586
You did? Why?

00:21.630 --> 00:23.153
We don't need a sixth opinion.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.025
I get it,
I can't have a baby.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.593
Well, we still haven't really
talked about other options.

00:28.637 --> 00:31.596
Honestly, I don't know if I'm
ready for that conversation yet.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.992
I was really excited to have
a baby and to be pregnant.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.342
Everyone's always talking about
that magical glow.

00:38.386 --> 00:39.996
Look, on the bright side,
you won't have to deal

00:40.040 --> 00:42.129
with the morning sickness
or the swollen ankles,

00:42.172 --> 00:43.782
or the gingivitis.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.915
Well, gum disease aside, I think
I just need a little time

00:45.958 --> 00:47.221
to come to terms with it all.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.787
Yeah. There's no rush. Okay?

00:48.831 --> 00:49.962
Take all the time you need.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.660
Oh.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.792
Speaking of time, I got to go.

00:53.836 --> 00:58.536
Maquillage de Molly & Marissa
are coming in. Yeah.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.191
- Yeah, they are.
- You know, the big makeup conglomerate.

01:01.235 --> 01:02.366
We've already turned a bunch of

01:02.410 --> 01:03.759
their smaller
beauty brands green.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.804
But now, I am thinking
they're finally ready

01:05.848 --> 01:08.198
to trust us
- with the entire account.
- Yeah.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.244
I assume by "green"
you mean eco-friendly?

01:10.287 --> 01:12.594
'Cause it's not really
- a great color for skin tone.
- Hello?

01:12.637 --> 01:14.074
My mission statement, remember?

01:14.117 --> 01:15.423
Just because
I can't have an heir

01:15.466 --> 01:16.946
doesn't mean
I've given up on my legacy.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.644
I am gonna save this planet, Liam,

01:19.688 --> 01:21.472
one vegan lip gloss at a time.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.257
Well, sounds like
a long-term plan.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.129
And whenever you're ready
to talk, I'll be right here.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.697
I know. Thank you.

01:28.740 --> 01:31.395
I'm so happy
we can rely on each other.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.616
- From one lover to another.
- Ooh!

01:34.659 --> 01:36.618
I love the sound of
Kenny Rogers in the morning.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.838
Oh, Liam, "Islands
in the Stream" is all Dolly.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.579
And as much as
I would love to stay here

01:41.623 --> 01:43.146
and give you
a musical education,

01:43.190 --> 01:44.582
I've got to get
to my 9:00 to 5:00.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.552
Wow. You just can't get enough,
can you?

01:57.595 --> 01:59.945
As much as I would love to stay
for some morning delight,

01:59.989 --> 02:01.860
I have to get to the hospital.
Problem is,

02:01.904 --> 02:03.471
I need to get to my room
without being spotted.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.690
I don't think Fallon would care
if she saw you.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.127
I mean,
she'd probably be happy

02:07.170 --> 02:08.519
that we're...

02:09.564 --> 02:11.870
What are we, actually?

02:11.914 --> 02:14.003
We haven't had that conversation
yet. Are we dating?

02:14.046 --> 02:16.136
I feel like I'm 17 again.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.355
We like each other, right?

02:19.313 --> 02:21.141
Seems like that to me.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.664
Oh, you really are 17 again,

02:22.707 --> 02:24.318
or maybe it's just
your hormones.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.971
However,

02:26.015 --> 02:27.495
I think we should spend
some time with each other

02:27.538 --> 02:30.498
outside the bedroom before
we start labeling anything.

02:30.541 --> 02:31.934
Oh, that sounds less fun.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.196
And also maybe
outside of the manor,

02:33.240 --> 02:34.719
because I don't really
want to bump into

02:34.763 --> 02:36.373
my father or my brother
or my sister.

02:36.417 --> 02:37.896
I get it.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.115
Let's do something tomorrow, then.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.769
It's a date.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.512
But, in the meantime,

02:44.555 --> 02:46.644
as long as I'm stuck in here...

02:46.688 --> 02:48.820
Oh, well, now who's 17 again?

02:50.605 --> 02:52.041
Ooh.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.303
Tell me my future,

02:53.347 --> 02:54.478
oh mystical one.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.827
I could've sworn our future

02:55.871 --> 02:57.220
involved some gym time,
where's your stuff?

02:57.264 --> 02:58.917
Ooh, I'm gonna need
a rain check.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.659
I made some different
workout plans with Sasha,

03:01.703 --> 03:02.704
if you catch my drift.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.836
No, please explain it to me

03:04.880 --> 03:06.447
and definitely wink again.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.145
So, all is well
in the land of lovebirds, then?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.407
It's great.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.409
We are making
some sweet music together.

03:12.453 --> 03:13.454
In fact,

03:13.497 --> 03:15.195
I'm asking her to move in tomorrow.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.283
Isn't that a little soon?

03:16.326 --> 03:17.588
I mean,

03:17.632 --> 03:18.894
do you even know her last name?

03:18.937 --> 03:20.765
Favorite color?
Preferred nut milk?

03:20.809 --> 03:21.897
What adult has a favorite color?

03:21.940 --> 03:22.985
Chartreuse.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.943
Besides you.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.249
And what better way
to get to know somebody

03:26.293 --> 03:27.250
than to move in with them?

03:27.294 --> 03:29.426
Well, she's just... right here.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.776
Oh, my God. I love tarot.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.648
Oh.

03:33.691 --> 03:34.736
Read me.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.172
Girl, with pleasure.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.653
Concentrate on the cards.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.572
Oh.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.095
Queen of Wands.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.705
What does that mean?

03:47.749 --> 03:48.880
It's the best card.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.882
It means I'm
a natural-born leader

03:50.926 --> 03:53.320
- and inspire others.
- Ah.

03:53.363 --> 03:56.888
And are super self-aware.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.413
Oh, that is definitely you.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.936
- Shall we?
- Yes.

04:00.979 --> 04:02.067
Ta-ta.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.118
<i>Well, you've been MIA.</i>

04:09.161 --> 04:12.252
The NordicStar Airlines
submissions are due soon,

04:12.295 --> 04:13.862
and while my publicist
has been getting

04:13.905 --> 04:15.777
the Dom-Mystique name out there,

04:15.820 --> 04:19.868
I have been working to get
my portfolio just perfect.

04:19.911 --> 04:23.480
That explains the, uh,
billboards all over town.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.134
Speaking of press... Mm?

04:25.177 --> 04:29.094
I saw a blurb that
someone anonymously posted

04:29.138 --> 04:31.488
a Plenexia drug formula online.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.577
I can only assume
you've made some people

04:33.621 --> 04:36.058
very unhappy
with this whole escapade.

04:36.101 --> 04:39.409
Yes, I may have received
a threatening voice mail

04:39.453 --> 04:40.845
from Plenexia's CEO,

04:40.889 --> 04:42.499
but it's nothing
I can't handle.

04:42.543 --> 04:45.676
All right? The important thing
is that justice was served.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.330
Luna would be very proud of you.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.245
But I am relieved

04:49.289 --> 04:51.682
that this whole Robin Hood
business is finished,

04:51.726 --> 04:55.338
so I can stop worrying about you
and we can both focus on me.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.166
Who said anything was finished?

04:57.209 --> 04:59.342
I-I'm just getting started.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.953
There's so many others out there
who are just like Payne.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.347
In fact, I've already found
my next target.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.654
Michael Bradford.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.656
The guy who owns the athletic
shoe company, SpringTime?

05:09.657 --> 05:12.094
I have two pairs of
his leopard print high-tops.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.313
What'd he do?

05:13.356 --> 05:14.488
I'm keeping my shoes.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.054
Colby Co. tried to buy

05:16.098 --> 05:17.839
Bradford's music
software company a while ago.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.275
Right before the deal closed,

05:19.319 --> 05:20.842
I learned that
his employee turnover rate

05:20.885 --> 05:22.365
was sky-high.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.411
He fired people indiscriminately,

05:24.454 --> 05:26.935
and he'd call employees
into his shareholder meetings

05:26.978 --> 05:28.502
just to humiliate them.

05:28.545 --> 05:31.287
Okay,
but what'd he do wrong now?

05:31.331 --> 05:33.289
Uh, more of the same,
with the shoe company.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.118
Only this time, he's not just
verbally abusing his employees,

05:36.161 --> 05:37.989
he's cutting
into their benefits.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.035
He has a private jet,

05:40.078 --> 05:43.125
his wife's hidden on payroll,
and falling sales.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.953
How else could he afford
all that?

05:44.996 --> 05:46.215
I just need to prove it.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.086
Jeff, honey.
Mm?

05:48.130 --> 05:49.653
You do know that you are not

05:49.697 --> 05:51.612
some invincible superhero,
right?

05:51.655 --> 05:54.136
These are powerful people
you're dealing with.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.965
Yeah, okay,
but I'm on the right side, Mom.

05:57.008 --> 05:59.359
Hey, Batman didn't have
any superpowers, either.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.970
Right?
Just a genius-level intellect

06:02.013 --> 06:04.102
and some truly stellar tech.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.321
Sound like anyone you know?

06:11.022 --> 06:11.980
Hey!

06:12.023 --> 06:13.460
Oh, good,
you're here.

06:13.503 --> 06:16.288
Does Grand Marnier say
"Give us all your business"?

06:16.332 --> 06:18.552
- Yes, but they're not coming.
- What?

06:18.595 --> 06:21.293
- Why not?
- Molly & Marissa heard about the PPA opening

06:21.337 --> 06:23.383
and realized
it was Blake's airport.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.341
They're threatening to pull
their current contracts.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.952
What the hell
does Morell have to do with PPA?

06:27.996 --> 06:29.432
That's Blake's
non-eco-friendly company,

06:29.476 --> 06:31.347
- not mine.
- He's your father.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.349
And, plus,
PPA used to be yours.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.524
It looks bad.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.134
Well, how do we make it
look better?

06:36.178 --> 06:37.571
I'm not sure.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.535
Here's what we'll do.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.319
You find a way

06:47.363 --> 06:49.757
to get Morell to reduce
PPA's carbon emissions enough

06:49.800 --> 06:51.454
so that
the makeup ladies love us,

06:51.498 --> 06:53.282
and I'll try to convince my dad

06:53.325 --> 06:55.066
that his airport needs
to be eco-friendly.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.372
Who wouldn't want to go green?

06:56.416 --> 06:58.809
Clearly, you don't know
Blake Carrington.

06:58.853 --> 07:01.377
Let's maybe save one of
those bottles for him.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.468
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]Hmm.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.991
You're still here.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.429
I work here.
Where else would I be?

07:09.472 --> 07:10.952
Well, I just thought
you'd have moved

07:10.995 --> 07:12.475
to your new office by now,

07:12.519 --> 07:13.607
what with the demotion
and everything.

07:13.650 --> 07:14.999
Oh, since I'm here, I will take

07:15.043 --> 07:16.827
that chief of staff parking pass
off your hands.

07:16.871 --> 07:19.395
Demotion? Am I supposed to know
what you're talking about?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.571
You think that the board is
gonna keep a chief of staff

07:21.615 --> 07:23.312
who used the hospital to indulge

07:23.355 --> 07:25.140
his illicit
botanical experiments?

07:25.183 --> 07:28.970
The vote to remove you is merely
just a formality at this point.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.276
You know, I-I did warn you
not to mess with me.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.670
Now you're just gonna
have to pay the price.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.498
I mean, what,
you've lost your dream job,

07:35.542 --> 07:37.152
your miracle ingredient,
and with any luck,

07:37.195 --> 07:38.675
your medical license.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.852
Oh, you're delusional
if you think I'm losing my job.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.114
Or my parking pass.

07:43.158 --> 07:44.812
I think you're just mad

07:44.855 --> 07:47.510
because you've run out of people
to bully, bribe, or blackmail.

07:47.554 --> 07:50.948
But you will have a considerably
smaller office to decorate.

08:03.352 --> 08:06.486
Hey, uh, yeah,
it's been a while.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.838
I've been thinking about you
a lot lately.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.066
Is this the entire
presentation?

08:22.110 --> 08:23.546
'Cause it's doing
nothing for me.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.157
Glad to know that sense of humor
declines with age.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.072
Okay.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.421
So, here's our problem.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.554
One of Morell's clients
is threatening

08:31.598 --> 08:32.947
to void their contract

08:32.990 --> 08:36.472
unless PPA reduces
their carbon emissions by 20%.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.691
I think you said "our problem"

08:37.734 --> 08:39.083
when you meant to say
"my problem."

08:39.127 --> 08:40.432
"My" meaning you, not me.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.435
My problems are your problems
are our problems.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.742
But, luckily, I have a solution
that works for everyone.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.616
Morell doesn't only
provide clean energy these days.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.095
We present a blueprint

08:51.139 --> 08:53.402
to turn your whole company
eco-friendly.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.143
So, PPA

08:55.186 --> 08:56.840
would hire Morell to come in

08:56.884 --> 08:58.189
and green up
your infrastructure.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.322
Change all the
lighting to LED,

09:00.365 --> 09:02.324
switch to
energy-saving escalators

09:02.367 --> 09:04.587
and install a reclaimed
water delivery service.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.589
This would not only

09:06.633 --> 09:08.156
garner you amazing press,

09:08.199 --> 09:10.462
but it would actually
save you money in the long run.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.160
- This all sounds good.
- Mm-hmm.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.814
Yeah, it's just a little
too good. What's the catch?

09:13.857 --> 09:16.817
Well,
you would just have to, uh,

09:16.860 --> 09:18.993
delay your airport opening
by two months

09:19.036 --> 09:21.343
while we go in and start
to make these changes.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.519
And before you say no... Too late. No.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.216
Wait, no.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.479
I had three more slides left
and a Q and A session.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.743
I've got a
have you lost your mind?

09:29.786 --> 09:30.874
I just spend
the last year

09:30.918 --> 09:32.572
fighting land deals

09:32.615 --> 09:33.877
and budget issues,

09:33.921 --> 09:35.792
the Environmental Species
Protection Program.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.446
And you want me to wait

09:37.489 --> 09:39.361
while you screw in
a few fancy lightbulbs?

09:39.404 --> 09:40.884
More than just a few.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.321
And you wouldn't even have PPA
if it weren't for me.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.888
We can't afford a delay, Fallon.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.586
There are construction loans
to repay

09:46.629 --> 09:48.283
and the airport's credibility
to consider.

09:48.326 --> 09:49.763
And also, I don't care

09:49.806 --> 09:52.243
about some fake hippie
Birkenstock-wearing do-gooders

09:52.287 --> 09:54.898
who want to green my airport
to up their street cred.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.596
Just because you're content

09:56.639 --> 09:58.032
watching the world
go up in flames

09:58.075 --> 09:59.599
doesn't mean everybody else is.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.818
Okay, here's an idea.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.385
If you can retrofit
those changes

10:03.428 --> 10:05.561
before the opening
in 48 hours--

10:05.605 --> 10:08.085
at a steep family discount--

10:08.129 --> 10:09.957
I don't see why
the words "luxury service"

10:10.000 --> 10:11.611
and "green energy"
can't coexist.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.830
Two days? Now who's crazy?

10:13.874 --> 10:16.441
You know what?
This meeting's adjourned.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.487
<i>So, what do you think of</i>

10:18.530 --> 10:19.923
our next contestant, Chad...

10:19.967 --> 10:22.317
Sasha's hot-tempered
and totally reckless.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.449
Okay, no spoilers.
I'm still on episode one.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.583
Wh-- I'm talking about your
model friend, Sasha. Real life.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.454
Not <i>Fun-Boy Island</i> or whatever
it is you're watching.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.586
Okay.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.980
Start over.
I need to recalibrate.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.590
Sasha's got Culhane
wrapped around

10:34.634 --> 10:36.418
her perfectly manicured
little finger.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.420
I had a bad feeling
the second he told me about her,

10:38.463 --> 10:39.682
and I ignored it.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.162
But then I read her cards,

10:41.205 --> 10:44.556
and I pulled the Queen of Wands.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.036
I can't ignore it now.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.821
My gut and the cards
can't both be wrong.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.866
That was probably just
some bad kombucha.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.651
Ever since you found out
Gaga has her own

10:51.694 --> 10:53.304
personal tarot reader,
you've lost your mind.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.132
Kirby, I'm perfectly sane.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.220
We need to break them up.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.265
You said it yourself,

10:57.308 --> 10:58.396
she's a total bitch.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.702
Well, I mean...

10:59.746 --> 11:01.573
she does tend
to backstab other models

11:01.617 --> 11:02.966
when it comes to jobs,

11:03.010 --> 11:04.402
and she was really mean
to hair and makeup

11:04.446 --> 11:05.490
at our last shoot.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.883
Exactly.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.276
You know who's mean
to people who work for them?

11:09.233 --> 11:11.758
Mean people, and you told me
she dumped her boyfriend

11:11.801 --> 11:13.629
right after he proposed
at the top of the Eiffel Tower

11:13.673 --> 11:15.196
because she didn't
like the ring.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.459
Yeah, and then he got
really depressed

11:17.502 --> 11:19.026
and, like, moved to Iowa.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.681
See? Do you think Culhane
will know the difference

11:21.724 --> 11:23.595
between clarity versus color?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.380
Or do you want him
to move to Iowa, too?

11:25.423 --> 11:27.643
I don't think moving to Iowa
is a requirement

11:27.687 --> 11:28.949
if Sasha dumps you,

11:28.992 --> 11:30.472
but maybe your cards are right.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.779
I mean, they did say that
romance would be in my future.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.258
Listen, we need to save him.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.478
He's planning on asking her
to move in tomorrow,

11:36.521 --> 11:37.958
right after he flies her
to Nashville

11:38.001 --> 11:39.350
to see the Clashing Flannels.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.135
They're having lunch
at La Mirage

11:41.178 --> 11:42.614
before they leave
in the afternoon.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.008
We just have to figure out
a way to separate them.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.054
Does it have to be tomorrow?

11:48.098 --> 11:49.839
Yes. Why?

11:49.883 --> 11:51.101
Do you have a date or something?

11:51.145 --> 11:52.973
Hold on.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.715
Did you say something
about romance earlier?

11:56.759 --> 11:58.587
Uh... Yeah.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.980
I just rewatched <i>The Notebook.</i>

12:00.981 --> 12:03.113
That's one good-looking couple.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.680
It's fine.
Um, I'll be there tomorrow.

12:07.639 --> 12:10.338
Oh, yes, that's the spot.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.731
Right there.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.515
You know,
you really don't need

12:13.558 --> 12:15.343
any of this stuff.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.648
Have you thought about modeling?

12:17.954 --> 12:19.695
Alexam could use
a face like yours.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.740
Cool it, Casanova.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.568
I don't hear from you
for months,

12:23.612 --> 12:27.094
and suddenly you show up
offering a free refresh?

12:27.137 --> 12:29.531
Ooh. What do you really want?

12:29.574 --> 12:31.576
Nothing crazy,
just a little help

12:31.620 --> 12:33.796
securing some Bokocho extract.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.016
I know that Van Kirk Industries
has a shipping port

12:36.059 --> 12:37.321
out of India.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.932
Oh, is that all?

12:38.975 --> 12:41.804
Just a little violation
of FDA regulations?

12:42.892 --> 12:45.025
Don't let this
baby-smooth skin fool you.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.027
- I wasn't born yesterday.
- Look.

12:47.070 --> 12:50.987
You like my product,
and I love giving it to you.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.206
But I can't be

12:52.249 --> 12:54.599
your confidential
cosmetic clinician

12:54.643 --> 12:56.297
without my secret ingredient.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.429
A few extra crates
won't hurt anyone.

12:58.473 --> 12:59.822
No one will notice.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.042
Well, what is
some illegal importing

13:02.085 --> 13:03.434
between old friends?

13:03.478 --> 13:05.262
I can call my contact in Mumbai,

13:05.306 --> 13:07.612
but you have to do something
for me in return.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.614
I'm a little tired,
but, uh...

13:09.658 --> 13:11.094
desk or couch?

13:11.138 --> 13:12.313
It's a charming offer,

13:12.356 --> 13:14.837
but I've already climbed
the family tree.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.448
The Van Kirks have
an upcoming board meeting

13:17.492 --> 13:20.016
to decide who controls VKI,

13:20.060 --> 13:22.845
and I need Liam's vote
to secure my position.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.586
But he's not returning
my calls.

13:24.629 --> 13:25.717
Gosh, he's so dramatic.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.154
All I said was that

13:27.197 --> 13:30.026
maybe Fallon's coma was
a blessing in disguise.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.115
How very glass-half-full of you.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.378
I just need 15 minutes
alone with him,

13:34.422 --> 13:35.727
and that's where you come in.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.077
Obviously, I'd love to help,

13:37.120 --> 13:39.514
but I'm not sure
I'm the right man for the job.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.342
Liam doesn't exactly trust me.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.692
Oh, that's too bad.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.650
You know,
now that I think about it,

13:45.694 --> 13:49.045
maybe VKI isn't the right
shipping company for you.

13:51.439 --> 13:52.483
<i>Great news.</i>

13:52.527 --> 13:54.529
The LED lighting can be
rush delivered

13:54.572 --> 13:55.835
in the next two weeks.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.056
You're not smiling.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.971
Unfortunately,
Blake seems set

14:02.015 --> 14:04.278
on killing both
the planet and my deal.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.846
Without a show of good faith
in emission reduction,

14:06.889 --> 14:09.413
Molly & Marissa will pull
their contract.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.415
Look, I have been
racking my brain all night,

14:11.459 --> 14:13.591
but I just don't think it's
possible in this time frame.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.419
We can always outsource.

14:15.463 --> 14:18.031
The Dodson Initiative is
the world's largest producer

14:18.074 --> 14:19.467
of renewable jet fuel.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.469
Blake can reduce emissions
by 70%

14:21.512 --> 14:23.210
as soon as the paperwork
is signed.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.299
Clearly, you want
this company to fail.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.344
I thought this was
a good idea.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.520
It is if you're
the VP of Dodson.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.088
If they solve the problem,
we're just exposing

14:32.132 --> 14:33.785
our lack of up-to-date tech.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.309
It makes Morell
look weak.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.832
I don't think that's true.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.921
The saying isn't "If you want
something done right,

14:38.965 --> 14:40.836
you have to let others do it."

14:40.880 --> 14:42.055
It has to be Morell.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.708
Well, then, we're gonna need
more time.

15:22.269 --> 15:25.402
I know I have a youthful glow,
but I really am his mother.

15:25.446 --> 15:28.101
- Jeff, have this man unhand me.
- You can ease up.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.363
She's fine. Thank you.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.278
Redecorating?

15:31.321 --> 15:33.323
Ha! Something like that.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.328
"I said you would pay.
Still want to play?"

15:38.372 --> 15:39.939
I'm not in the mood for riddles.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.419
That note was attached to
what's left of my painting.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.988
I told you not to mess
with the shoe guy.

15:46.032 --> 15:49.949
I haven't even started with
Michael Bradford and SpringTime.

15:49.992 --> 15:53.387
This is from Richard Payne,
the CEO of Plenexia.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.954
Well, did you call the police?

15:54.997 --> 15:58.522
And what? Admit that I stole
his top secret intel first?

15:58.566 --> 16:02.657
No. Besides, I assume
this makes us even.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.093
Hey, hey, hey.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.791
I knew retaliation was
a possibility.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.358
Okay? I'll be prepared

16:08.402 --> 16:10.056
if Michael Bradford
tries to strike.

16:10.099 --> 16:13.233
Wait, you're still going
- after SpringTime?
- Absolutely.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.322
Why? Stealing a shoe design

16:15.365 --> 16:16.671
is more important
than your safety?

16:16.714 --> 16:18.890
What I'm doing is
way more important

16:18.934 --> 16:20.153
than stealing his shoe design.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.111
I'm worried about you.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.765
Well, don't be.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.246
I'm just looking out
for the little guy.

16:26.289 --> 16:29.727
I've purchased a considerable
amount of stock in SpringTime.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.338
Their shareholder meeting
is tomorrow,

16:31.381 --> 16:33.122
and I'm going to be
on that video call

16:33.166 --> 16:35.907
to expose Michael Bradford
for who he really is.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.389
It's time he had
the tables turned on him.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.305
You said there was
something wrong with my mother?

16:42.349 --> 16:44.220
Don't be alarmed.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.226
She was
in a serious car accident,

16:50.270 --> 16:52.794
and she needs
emergency surgery.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.318
Yeah, um...

16:55.362 --> 16:57.016
You know what? Let's...

16:57.059 --> 16:58.582
let's save some time and money.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.194
Skip the surgery and let her go.
Pull the plug.

17:01.237 --> 17:04.197
Jack Liam Ridley Lowden,

17:04.240 --> 17:06.199
I am your mother. How dare you?

17:06.242 --> 17:07.461
It's a miracle.

17:07.504 --> 17:08.679
I cannot believe

17:08.723 --> 17:10.594
that I mean so little to you.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.379
You have grown so cold.

17:12.422 --> 17:15.599
Oh, come on. I knew this was
a setup from the beginning.

17:15.643 --> 17:19.473
And even if I didn't, next time
that you're in an accident,

17:19.516 --> 17:20.648
don't reapply fresh lipstick

17:20.691 --> 17:23.085
before they put in
an oxygen tube.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.392
Oh, and maybe
take off your heels.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.396
This is sad, even for you.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.398
Well, what did you
expect me to do?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.400
You're not returning
any of my calls.

17:33.443 --> 17:35.793
I need your help.
I had to get your attention.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.752
And you thought this was
the best way to do that?

17:37.795 --> 17:42.278
Your Aunt Mora is trying to
replace me as president of VKI.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.368
But if you and your sister
would join me,

17:45.412 --> 17:46.891
we'd have the votes
to shut her down.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.589
Yeah, I-I think I'm gonna sit
this one out.

17:48.632 --> 17:49.720
Would think of your future?

17:49.764 --> 17:51.809
You may not like
the Van Kirks,

17:51.853 --> 17:53.463
but this is still
your family business.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.292
No, Mom, it's your business,

17:56.336 --> 17:58.120
and VKI is not my future.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.600
That's the only reason
I showed up here,

17:59.643 --> 18:00.731
to tell you that.

18:00.775 --> 18:03.560
So now... I can go.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.214
No.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.913
So, I did what you asked
and I got him to come.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.654
Uh, can we talk about
my shipment now?

18:10.698 --> 18:14.571
Well, there's nothing to talk
about until the VKI vote.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.791
If I have no company,
you have no deal.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.971
For the record,

18:23.014 --> 18:25.191
I think I've proven that
I'm far more valuable to you

18:25.234 --> 18:26.757
when I'm alive.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.542
Alive?
What are you talking about?

18:28.585 --> 18:30.109
Do you think I brought you
out here to kill you?

18:30.152 --> 18:31.893
You seemed so upset about PPA,

18:31.936 --> 18:34.939
and you did bring a large bag
for a trip to the woods.

18:34.983 --> 18:37.246
The only thing getting
buried in this bag

18:37.290 --> 18:39.814
is Blake's dream of
opening his airport tomorrow.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.121
If the Environmental Species
Protection people find

18:42.164 --> 18:44.079
any sign of an endangered
animal on these grounds,

18:44.123 --> 18:45.515
all construction must stop.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.343
The whole process
could take months.

18:47.387 --> 18:51.130
And it just so happens there's
an ESPP agent on the way.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.175
But what if they don't find
any animals?

18:53.219 --> 18:54.524
Oh, they'll find at least one.

18:54.568 --> 18:58.224
Meet the endangered
gopher tortoise.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.314
There are only 567 left
in the wild.

19:01.357 --> 19:04.360
Well, 566 at the moment.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.233
Want to hold him?

19:09.365 --> 19:11.237
[phone rings]
It's Sam.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.281
I got to take this.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.456
One sec.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.155
Yo, what's up?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.330
Are you at the hotel?

19:17.373 --> 19:18.896
You need to get to the club
right now.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.681
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

19:20.724 --> 19:21.943
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't have to.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.858
Listen, two headliners
got booked tonight,

19:23.901 --> 19:25.816
and they're both there
about to draw blood

19:25.860 --> 19:27.340
over who goes on last.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.559
Well, can't you go?
Where's Javier?

19:29.603 --> 19:32.301
I'm stuck in traffic, and
they'll only talk to an owner.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.042
It's funny
how you remember

19:34.085 --> 19:35.739
that we're equal partners when
it comes to things like this.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.003
It's okay. Go.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.091
I am so sorry.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.180
I'll be right back.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.406
Where's he off to
in the middle of your date?

19:50.450 --> 19:51.494
Seems kind of rude.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.192
Work stuff.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.628
Typical.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.804
I am glad to be out of
that situation,

19:56.847 --> 19:58.458
but I'm sure
you'll get used to it.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.416
Right. You dated.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.332
Well, I like that
he's passionate about his job.

20:03.376 --> 20:06.161
Yeah, I mean, I did too,
at first.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.771
But then I started to feel
like his mistress,

20:07.815 --> 20:09.251
because he was married
to his soccer team.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.210
That's fine.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.776
You know me,
I'm not exactly into

20:12.820 --> 20:14.691
being attached
at the hip anyway.

20:15.562 --> 20:16.563
I like to go out.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.435
Right.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.002
Though back when
we were a couple,

20:21.045 --> 20:23.352
I was a bit of a partier
and he was not into that at all.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.963
I mean, he would get so mad
if I was out late

20:26.007 --> 20:29.445
with my friends,
and late to him is 10:30 p.m.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.404
Serious grandpa vibes.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.232
That doesn't sound like him.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.408
Oh, maybe he's changed.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.105
I just feel like you should know
what you're getting

20:37.148 --> 20:39.281
yourself into. You know,
I owe it to you as a friend.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.113
Blake is playing with his watch.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.723
He's clearly pissed.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.682
Just wait
until he sees our tortoise.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.901
Well, I don't know
what you have been told,

20:50.945 --> 20:54.122
but I we moved every turtle,
egg, and...

20:54.165 --> 20:56.951
God knows what else to a farm

20:56.994 --> 21:00.215
to live out the rest of
their slow, boring lives.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.262
First, they're tortoises,
not turtles.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.698
Second, I can assure you,
Mr. Carrington,

21:04.741 --> 21:06.134
they're anything but boring.

21:06.177 --> 21:07.527
I think what my husband
is trying to say

21:07.570 --> 21:09.224
is that all the tur...

21:09.268 --> 21:11.139
...toises are safe and sound.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.923
Far away.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.186
What can we do
to help speed things along?

21:15.230 --> 21:16.579
I need to take a look
around the property

21:16.623 --> 21:17.711
for any tortal activity.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.190
If what you're saying
is true,

21:19.234 --> 21:21.280
I'll be out of your "hare"
soon enough.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.717
Okay, it's showtime.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.240
Here we go.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.155
What? No.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.723
No, no, no. What is
the stupid tortoise doing?

21:29.766 --> 21:31.377
He's going the wrong way.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.729
- Okay, give me your shoe.
- What?

21:35.772 --> 21:37.426
Uh, they're limited edition.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.688
Oh, my God.
They're not even runway.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.211
Come on. Give it to me.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.691
Hurry.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.608
What was that?

21:47.044 --> 21:49.438
Look wat we have there.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.398
I guess you didn't get
every one.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.663
How can you really know
that this one's endangered?

21:56.706 --> 21:57.664
Look at him.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.057
He looks so unworried.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.363
Unfortunately for your airport,

22:01.407 --> 22:03.234
his markings make it clear
that he is.

22:05.106 --> 22:07.804
I'm Eden. We'll be seeing
a lot of each other

22:07.848 --> 22:09.153
for the next month or two.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.078
We are supposed to be talking,
not snogging.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.385
Well, technically the date
hasn't started yet.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.387
Are we going camping
or something?

22:25.431 --> 22:26.997
No, I thought
we'd go on a picnic.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.172
I mean,
that's what normal people do

22:28.216 --> 22:29.652
who already
don't live together, right?

22:29.696 --> 22:33.003
Well, that depends
how you define normal.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.918
Amanda? Is that you?
Would you come here, please?

22:34.962 --> 22:36.093
Stay here, okay?

22:36.137 --> 22:37.617
I'll get rid of him.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.575
Hey.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.142
Um, sorry.

22:41.185 --> 22:42.883
I'm actually in a bit of a rush.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.972
I need to get to work,
you know how it is, the old, uh,

22:45.015 --> 22:46.539
um, ball and chain.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.367
Yeah, you know,
I do know how it is.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.151
That's-that's why
I need your help with PPA.

22:50.194 --> 22:51.805
Oh, wish I could,

22:51.848 --> 22:53.459
but these malpractice suits,

22:53.502 --> 22:55.243
they just won't
defend themselves.

22:55.286 --> 22:56.766
My airport is getting shut down

22:56.810 --> 22:59.900
because of one stupid,
supposedly endangered turtle.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.554
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't an emergency.

23:01.597 --> 23:02.859
Well, I just don't really
know that much

23:02.903 --> 23:04.121
about environmental law.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.427
You're a Carrington,
you're smarter than

23:05.471 --> 23:07.124
anyone I have on payroll.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.561
This airport means everything
to me.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.869
Sure, yeah. Uh...

23:12.913 --> 23:14.218
We'll discuss it.
I'll make some calls.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.090
Great, everything's
in my office.

23:24.228 --> 23:27.101
I know you're disappointed
in Liam's reaction,

23:27.144 --> 23:28.972
which is why
I am here to offer you

23:29.016 --> 23:31.366
ten percent of Alexam's profits

23:31.410 --> 23:33.760
if you can work
this shipping deal.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.065
I don't need money.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.676
Laura, darling,

23:36.719 --> 23:38.547
what do I need to give you
to make this happen?

23:38.591 --> 23:40.723
Just name it.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.204
Why do I suddenly feel like I'm
making a deal with the devil?

23:44.292 --> 23:46.294
Can you grant me immortality?

23:46.337 --> 23:50.472
Well, everlasting youth is
my bread and butter.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.995
How about I offer you

23:52.039 --> 23:55.346
a standing appointment
of free injections for a year.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.479
For the use of my ships
and my contacts,

23:57.523 --> 24:00.047
make it my own
personal lifetime supply.

24:00.090 --> 24:01.265
No, that's insane.

24:01.309 --> 24:04.138
How about, uh,
I offer you house calls?

24:04.181 --> 24:05.139
Personal service.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.183
Nope.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.229
Everything upfront or nothing.

24:08.272 --> 24:11.058
I'd like to say I trust you,
but you're a Carrington.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.755
Lying is your dominant gene.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.583
If I let you self-administer,

24:14.627 --> 24:16.629
I'd be jeopardizing
my medical license.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.500
Not to mention
I only have

24:18.544 --> 24:19.893
fewer than ten left.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.503
I need more extract.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.418
I'll take everything
you have on hand

24:23.462 --> 24:25.855
and the rest
when you're back in production.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.857
And I know how to
handle injectables.

24:27.901 --> 24:30.077
I've been getting maintenance
since before you were born.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.079
- Fine, we have a deal.
- Ah.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.820
If I can't have my son
in my life,

24:33.863 --> 24:35.865
at least I'll look
too young to have one.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.693
It's not you Liam's mad at.

24:37.737 --> 24:40.000
Fallon just found out
she can't carry a baby,

24:40.043 --> 24:41.784
and they're taking it
pretty hard.

24:41.828 --> 24:43.525
He just needs some time.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.050
<i>You're screwed.</i>

24:47.094 --> 24:49.531
Oh, is that
your official legal opinion?

24:49.575 --> 24:52.186
Look, the ESPP has opened an
investigation of the property.

24:52.229 --> 24:53.970
It could take up to 12 weeks.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.232
This will cripple us.

24:55.276 --> 24:56.843
Our loans are due
in half that time.

24:56.886 --> 24:59.454
And you're also being charged
with reckless endangerment

24:59.498 --> 25:00.977
for not handling
the problem

25:01.021 --> 25:02.370
before the construction started.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.850
Then this is nonsense.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.678
Cristal oversaw the transfer herself.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.941
Everything was handled
safely and completely.

25:07.984 --> 25:10.857
Everything except for
one slow reptile.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.728
Something doesn't feel right.

25:12.772 --> 25:15.165
I've never seen so much
as a snake in that grass.

25:15.209 --> 25:17.254
Hey, I didn't realize we were
having a family meeting.

25:17.298 --> 25:18.386
What are we discussing?

25:18.429 --> 25:19.822
The airport opening is off.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.128
The plant-eating,
tree-hugging

25:21.171 --> 25:24.044
environmental protection agent
shut us down.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.699
Some endangered species crap.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.701
I'm sorry, I was just about
to tell you that

25:28.744 --> 25:30.790
my team was ready
with the LED lighting,

25:30.833 --> 25:32.705
but we'll hold off
until you're ready.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.097
I don't want to stress you out
even more.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.186
And I'll put a call
into a judge,

25:36.230 --> 25:37.492
see if I can get this expedited.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.712
Just when you think you're safe,
a tornado hits.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.365
Well, let's hope
this is the last one.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.584
Morell will make sure

25:42.628 --> 25:43.890
to stormproof.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.457
You guys are family.
PPA is my first priority.

25:46.501 --> 25:48.547
- That's kind of you, Fallon.
- God.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.549
Who knew one little turtle
could cause such a stir?

25:51.419 --> 25:52.812
Keep me posted on everything.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.990
So, is it congrats
or condolences?

25:58.252 --> 26:00.080
After I handled
the battle of the bands,

26:00.123 --> 26:01.603
I spoke to the events team

26:01.647 --> 26:03.474
to see how such a big mistake happened.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.041
Marie said she warned you,

26:05.085 --> 26:06.042
but you didn't listen.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.218
She must've misunderstood me.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.656
I said wanted two rock bands
on back-to-back nights,

26:10.699 --> 26:13.354
not two back-to-back rock bands
on one night.

26:13.397 --> 26:16.052
And then I opened Snapchat,
and I saw that your Bitmoji was

26:16.096 --> 26:19.665
at the manor when you were
supposedly in your car.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.971
- Do people still use that app?
- Okay, that is enough.

26:22.015 --> 26:24.452
- Agreed, let's have a drink.
- No.

26:24.495 --> 26:25.496
I meant enough lying.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.630
Kirby just happened to be
at the restaurant

26:28.674 --> 26:30.763
during the time I was gone
and badmouthed me to Sasha.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.329
I couldn't ask her
to move in with me,

26:32.373 --> 26:33.983
because, when I got back,
she left.

26:34.027 --> 26:36.072
Well, Kirby can be a real bitch.

26:36.116 --> 26:38.074
I know Kirby did not
do this alone, Sam.

26:38.118 --> 26:40.555
Okay, fine.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.645
I can be a bitch, too,
but only when it's needed.

26:43.689 --> 26:46.387
The Queen of Wands isn't
a great card.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.433
It means she'll bring chaos
into your life.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.044
I tried to think
reasonably about this,

26:51.087 --> 26:53.481
but look at what
she did to her ex.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.918
And remember all those things
Charlie said about her?

26:55.962 --> 26:57.746
Plus,
she almost ruined your movie

26:57.790 --> 26:59.443
with a single Insta post.

26:59.487 --> 27:00.880
That guy was a jerk,

27:00.923 --> 27:03.447
the photo was a mistake,
and people change.

27:03.491 --> 27:04.884
I'm trying to protect you.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.712
- I'm being a good friend here.
- Really?

27:06.755 --> 27:08.714
It doesn't feel like it.

27:08.757 --> 27:09.976
So, go ahead and keep
your UNO! cards

27:10.019 --> 27:11.847
and your crystal ball
away from us.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.416
Ah.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.505
What took you so long?

27:17.548 --> 27:18.898
Didn't take me long at all.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.595
Just a few minutes, actually.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.815
It's a little late
for some stepmother bonding,

27:22.858 --> 27:25.252
don't you think? Or are you here
to read me a bedtime story?

27:25.295 --> 27:28.559
Yeah, ever hear of the tortoise
and the air... port?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.693
I much prefer the one
with the seven little maids.

27:31.737 --> 27:34.000
Speaking of which,
can you please ask Jeanette

27:34.043 --> 27:35.349
to bring me my sleeping mask?

27:35.392 --> 27:36.785
Ask her yourself.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.439
I know what you did, Fallon.

27:38.482 --> 27:39.701
You sabotaged the opening.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.399
You sound crazy.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.924
Or wait, is this
the impostor Cristal again?

27:44.967 --> 27:46.534
You said "one little turtle,"

27:46.577 --> 27:48.188
but no one in there
said a word about turtles.

27:49.755 --> 27:50.930
Or how many there were.

27:50.973 --> 27:53.454
Are you sure it wasn't
an impostor Fallon?

27:53.497 --> 27:55.717
This is a limited-time offer.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.807
Call the ESPP
and tell them this was a hoax,

27:58.851 --> 28:01.027
or I will make sure
that Blake knows everything.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.116
Morell won't be
the only thing you lose.

28:03.159 --> 28:04.813
I know how much
his trust means to you.

28:04.857 --> 28:08.382
Wow, looks like that lady boss
seminar really worked miracles.

28:08.425 --> 28:09.949
Have I made myself clear?

28:11.037 --> 28:12.212
Crystal.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.267
This project has experienced
quite a bit of turbulence.

28:24.311 --> 28:25.921
But from now on,

28:25.965 --> 28:29.490
it'll be nothing
but blue skies ahead.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.144
Now, if you indulge me,

28:31.187 --> 28:32.972
just for a moment,
I need to thank my partner,

28:33.015 --> 28:35.148
both in business and in life,

28:35.191 --> 28:36.802
my wife Cristal.

28:36.845 --> 28:39.935
She and my daughter Amanda
are the reason

28:39.979 --> 28:42.982
we are celebrating today
and not three months from now.

28:46.289 --> 28:49.249
I would also like to thank
the man who inspired me

28:49.292 --> 28:50.990
to pursue this dream.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.948
I only wish that
he was here today

28:52.992 --> 28:54.820
to witness its unveiling,

28:54.863 --> 28:58.911
but I am sure that
he is watching from up above.

28:58.954 --> 29:03.698
Welcome to the Joseph Anders
Memorial Airport.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.749
Okay. I understand.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.403
Thank you.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.405
Sorry if you felt
left out of the speech,

29:15.449 --> 29:17.451
but I figured

29:17.494 --> 29:19.018
Blake's gratitude for you
fixing this

29:19.061 --> 29:21.237
would be outweighed by
his anger for you causing this.

29:21.281 --> 29:22.456
You're probably right.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.892
You want to help me out?

29:23.936 --> 29:25.938
Can you find me
another multi-million-dollar

29:25.981 --> 29:27.940
makeup company
that wants to go green?

29:27.983 --> 29:29.637
Because Molly & Marissa
are leaving.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.204
I wish I could,

29:31.247 --> 29:32.553
but I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.946
You always do.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.906
What are you doing?

29:37.950 --> 29:38.994
The shareholder meeting's
just about to start.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.779
Oh, I'm aware.
What are you doing?

29:40.822 --> 29:43.172
Taking down a villain
and serving justice.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.260
At least I was about to
before you stopped me.

29:45.392 --> 29:47.742
Enough with the comic book talk.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.179
Have you thought about
what will happen to SpringTime

29:50.223 --> 29:52.965
if you get on that call
and expose their CEO?

29:53.008 --> 29:54.444
What if the scandal

29:54.488 --> 29:57.839
you're about to cause
shuts down the company?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.058
Well, I suppose that's the price

29:59.101 --> 30:00.407
Michael Bradford will
have to pay.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.756
If he's as sleazy a CEO

30:01.800 --> 30:04.846
as you say,
it's a price he could afford.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.587
But what about everyone else?

30:06.630 --> 30:08.154
500 people

30:08.197 --> 30:11.026
could lose their benefits
and their jobs.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.462
They're working for a monster.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.160
Okay? I'm saving them.

30:14.203 --> 30:15.988
I know your intentions are good,

30:16.031 --> 30:18.120
but this isn't
the way to make a difference.

30:19.339 --> 30:21.863
Destroying the villain doesn't
always make you the hero.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.909
So what am I supposed to do?
Just let him get away with this?

30:23.952 --> 30:26.868
I think you can do more good
by helping than harming.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.827
The Jeff I know

30:28.870 --> 30:31.568
is a builder, an inventor.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.311
Let me put it
in terms you'll understand.

30:35.355 --> 30:38.140
This is a job for Bruce Wayne,

30:38.184 --> 30:39.533
not Batman.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.667
I know we're technically
out of the bedroom,

30:43.711 --> 30:45.800
but this isn't exactly
the date I had in mind.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.193
Oh, you're hard to please.

30:47.236 --> 30:48.672
Champagne, charcuterie,

30:48.716 --> 30:49.848
fancy dresses.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.066
What more could a girl want?

30:51.110 --> 30:53.242
I don't know,
about 150 fewer people?

30:53.286 --> 30:54.635
You know, you'd think
for a private airport

30:54.678 --> 30:56.289
they'd have
a little bit more privacy.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.903
I have an idea.
Come with me.

31:05.689 --> 31:07.517
It's a duet.

31:07.561 --> 31:09.824
Aren't they equally important?
Isn't that the point of a duet?

31:09.868 --> 31:12.087
Dolly Parton has
her own theme park.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.915
Kenny Rogers has
a few chicken restaurants.

31:13.959 --> 31:17.397
Well, he's actually not alive
anymore, but I get your point.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.529
What? Kenny Rogers is dead?

31:20.661 --> 31:22.750
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.883
I'm just finding out about this.
When did this happen?

31:24.926 --> 31:26.188
No, that wasn't about Kenny.

31:26.232 --> 31:27.537
It was about
my mother being here.

31:27.581 --> 31:29.278
LVK's here?

31:30.758 --> 31:31.977
Don't let Cristal see.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.848
I just hope she doesn't see me.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.937
I-I can't sit through
another lecture

31:35.981 --> 31:37.765
on how I'm not thinking about
the family business.

31:37.808 --> 31:40.463
I take it she doesn't know about
your adventures in baby-making?

31:40.507 --> 31:43.902
No, and I'd like to keep it
that way, so lower your voice.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.425
I mean, she is your mother.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.688
Maybe she's just
looking out for you?

31:48.907 --> 31:50.517
Yeah. I know, I heard it.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.998
You know, she claims
it's about what's best for me,

31:53.041 --> 31:55.391
as long as it's really
what's best for her.

31:55.435 --> 31:58.525
It's all about what she wants
for her own personal agenda.

31:58.568 --> 31:59.961
Hmm.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.528
See if you can come up
with a list

32:01.571 --> 32:04.444
of 20 companies who are dying
to go eco-friendly.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.881
Okay? And, Kelly, make sure
they have deep pockets.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.622
Thank you.

32:08.665 --> 32:09.710
Great.

32:09.753 --> 32:11.016
It's the mother-in-law.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.669
So, I see that
two weeks of "beauty rest"

32:12.713 --> 32:14.062
didn't do much good.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.022
I think you called it a coma?

32:17.065 --> 32:18.501
What are you doing here, Laura?

32:18.545 --> 32:20.329
You know what I love about you,
Fallon?

32:20.373 --> 32:21.722
My father and my brother?

32:21.765 --> 32:24.246
It's that you're always
proving me right.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.769
I knew you were useless.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.208
But you can't even
get pregnant now?

32:29.251 --> 32:31.079
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry, dear.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.733
It's probably best
you don't have children.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.256
You haven't got
the maternal instinct.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.649
You wouldn't know
maternal instinct

32:35.692 --> 32:37.303
if it bit you in the ass.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.261
You're denying your husband
a family.

32:39.305 --> 32:42.351
And, meanwhile,
I've got a list of Georgia debs

32:42.395 --> 32:44.963
just ready and anxious
to get the job done.

32:45.006 --> 32:47.182
If you really loved Liam,
you'd just step aside.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.271
Give it up, you old gank.

32:49.315 --> 32:50.969
Your attempts
to break us up are

32:51.012 --> 32:53.449
as futile as your attempt
to look younger.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.321
Well, I don't have to attempt
anything this time,

32:55.364 --> 32:56.409
'cause you did

32:56.452 --> 32:57.888
all the work for me,

32:57.932 --> 32:58.977
you barren bitch.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.892
You...

33:03.546 --> 33:04.939
Don't you dare touch my wife.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.899
You're taking her side?

33:08.943 --> 33:11.380
The woman that just
violently accosted your mother?

33:11.424 --> 33:12.991
Liam, she is unhinged!

33:13.034 --> 33:15.471
No! She's just had
enough of your crap.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.777
And so have I.

33:18.213 --> 33:20.346
Giving birth doesn't
make someone a mother, Laura.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.130
You're living proof of that.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.481
I am done.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.527
I am calling my lawyer
in the morning,

33:27.570 --> 33:30.182
and I'm having him cut you
out of my will and my life.

33:30.225 --> 33:31.313
You know what?
Why not today? Need a ride?

33:31.357 --> 33:33.185
I don't want to
see either of you

33:33.228 --> 33:34.316
ever again.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.622
Can we get that in writing?

33:35.665 --> 33:37.450
I'm so sorry, Fallon,

33:37.493 --> 33:39.452
that you're such a failure.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.497
You always have been.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.412
And you always will be.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.552
Why did we just do that?
We're supposed to be

33:52.595 --> 33:55.163
learning about each other,
not joining the...

33:55.207 --> 33:57.165
not-exactly-a-mile-high club.

33:57.209 --> 34:01.517
Well, I did learn what
you sound like at full volume.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.432
Okay. Enough of that.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.260
Let's get down
to business, okay?

34:05.304 --> 34:07.480
Oat or almond milk?

34:07.523 --> 34:09.090
- Oat.
- Mm.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.526
Welcome aboard, Dan.

34:10.570 --> 34:11.658
My pleasure, Blake.

34:12.702 --> 34:14.530
Oh, my God.
I'm thrilled to take you

34:14.574 --> 34:16.619
on the inaugural flight
out of the new airport.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.317
Can't wait.
Come on up to the cockpit.

34:20.623 --> 34:21.972
Now what?

34:22.016 --> 34:23.322
Now we have plenty of time

34:23.365 --> 34:24.714
to get to know each other,
right?

34:28.849 --> 34:32.070
I need to say I'm sorry
times, like, 1,000.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.636
I do stand
by the fact

34:33.680 --> 34:35.160
that I was trying
to protect you.

34:35.203 --> 34:36.378
I'm sure you do.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.338
But that was only,
like, ten percent of it.

34:39.381 --> 34:42.384
So, was the other 90%
just that you hated Sasha?

34:42.428 --> 34:44.995
No. It had nothing to do
with her.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.650
I was just panicking that our
friendship was slipping away.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.609
I mean, you spend
all your free time with Sasha,

34:49.652 --> 34:51.785
and all we talk about is work.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.569
I just feel like

34:53.613 --> 34:56.224
we're business partners
and that's it.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.357
- That is not true.
- Well, that's how it feels.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.447
You went from your movie
with Liam right to Sasha.

35:01.490 --> 35:03.231
I don't know, I guess
I just miss the old times.

35:03.275 --> 35:05.581
You know, like, charity tennis

35:05.625 --> 35:07.192
and designing
the new club.

35:08.497 --> 35:11.021
- Electrocuting contractors.
- Okay.

35:11.065 --> 35:13.111
I promise no more
missed gym days.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.503
And it's okay if there are.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.244
Maybe you can even
bring Sasha,

35:16.288 --> 35:18.507
and we can make it
like a fitness class.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.856
Actually,
I'd rather not,

35:19.900 --> 35:22.294
considering that
Ms. Sasha dumped me.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.296
No. No, no, no, no, no.
This is totally my fault.

35:24.339 --> 35:25.645
I'll call her right now
and I'll explain.

35:25.688 --> 35:26.907
What's her number?

35:26.950 --> 35:29.605
This had nothing to do
with you or Kirby.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.172
I guess I missed the memo

35:31.216 --> 35:34.044
that we were seeing
other people,

35:34.088 --> 35:35.568
which is a problem

35:35.611 --> 35:36.830
when you want someone
to move in.

35:36.873 --> 35:39.224
Well, that's her loss
and your gain.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.356
Because Mrs. Culhane
is out there somewhere,

35:41.400 --> 35:43.619
and you'll meet her
when you least expect it.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.752
Good, 'cause I am
no longer expecting it.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.188
So, should we hit the gym now?

35:47.232 --> 35:49.538
Actually,
I'd rather hit the tequila.

35:49.582 --> 35:50.844
Would you like to join?

35:50.887 --> 35:52.759
I think I can help with that.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.369
<i>So, I made a call</i>

35:54.413 --> 35:56.937
to the head of
the Dodson Initiative,

35:56.980 --> 35:58.982
and PPA's green problem

35:59.026 --> 36:00.723
is now taken care of.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.465
With the cost covered 100%
by Morell.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.902
PPA never had a green problem.
You did.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.556
You know that this is
what's best for your company

36:07.600 --> 36:08.862
in the long run.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.255
I just sped up your timetable.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.953
And you know this is best
for both of our companies.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.737
I assume the beauty brand is
back with you?

36:15.825 --> 36:18.045
If this always could've
solved everything,

36:18.088 --> 36:20.134
why did you need to bother
with the turtle games?

36:20.178 --> 36:22.789
I just couldn't be a failure
twice in one week.

36:24.530 --> 36:25.574
Twice?

36:25.618 --> 36:27.185
When we found out

36:27.228 --> 36:29.187
that I can't have a baby...

36:31.101 --> 36:33.278
...I just felt
like my body had failed me.

36:33.321 --> 36:35.280
And I felt that

36:35.323 --> 36:37.238
maybe I had failed Liam, too.

36:37.282 --> 36:38.805
But you know that's not true.

36:38.848 --> 36:42.156
Yeah, logically, yes, but...

36:42.200 --> 36:44.506
emotionally...

36:44.550 --> 36:46.726
I just...

36:46.769 --> 36:49.555
I always thought that I would be
able to carry my own baby.

36:51.513 --> 36:54.864
You know, that I would be able
to have that bond

36:54.908 --> 36:56.475
and that connection.

36:57.519 --> 36:58.825
Unfortunately,

36:58.868 --> 37:00.783
I know exactly how you feel.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.439
What happened to each of us
isn't fair.

37:04.483 --> 37:05.701
Life isn't fair,

37:05.745 --> 37:08.313
but you are definitely
not a failure.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.273
Do you still wish that
you would've had a baby?

37:12.317 --> 37:15.755
I try not to think about
what I can't have anymore.

37:15.798 --> 37:18.453
And I found
a different kind of fulfillment.

37:18.497 --> 37:21.195
So will you.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.676
You're allowed to ask for help
if you need it.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.330
You don't have to do this alone.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.811
Thank you, Cristal.

37:32.032 --> 37:36.297
And Morell doesn't need
to cover PPA's cost.

37:36.341 --> 37:39.213
I admire your drive to leave
this world a better place.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.606
So, you'll cover it, then?

37:40.649 --> 37:42.390
Well, 50%.

37:42.434 --> 37:43.826
I still have to deal
with your father.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.701
What are we celebrating?

37:48.744 --> 37:50.964
The fact that you were right.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.531
Humiliation was
not the way

37:52.574 --> 37:54.533
to take Michael Bradford down.

37:54.576 --> 37:55.969
So, what did you do?

37:56.012 --> 37:57.797
I got him the easy way.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.668
I bought a lot more stock,

37:59.712 --> 38:02.845
enough to control the company,
and then I fired his ass.

38:02.889 --> 38:05.283
And you're okay with letting him
get away with his crimes?

38:05.326 --> 38:07.633
Oh, no. I'm sending
my findings to the IRS.

38:07.676 --> 38:11.463
Michael will not be running
another company any time soon,

38:11.506 --> 38:14.204
and he can kiss
that private jet goodbye.

38:14.248 --> 38:16.076
And probably his wife, too.

38:16.119 --> 38:17.512
I'm proud of you.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.079
It's easy to get lost
in revenge.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.646
Hmm.

38:20.689 --> 38:23.736
Maybe Dom-Mystique can do
a shoe collab in the future.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.694
Let's put a pin
in that for now.

38:25.738 --> 38:29.307
Look, I have been trying
to fill a void,

38:29.350 --> 38:30.786
and I realized

38:30.830 --> 38:32.788
what I've really
been missing is me.

38:34.181 --> 38:35.835
I spent years
working on Colby Co.,

38:35.878 --> 38:38.316
and then I just let it crumble

38:38.359 --> 38:40.579
with a little help
from neurotoxicity.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.015
You're young.

38:42.058 --> 38:44.060
Life is a marathon,
not a sprint.

38:44.104 --> 38:45.758
Exactly.

38:45.801 --> 38:49.239
And now, I finally know
which direction I'm running.

38:49.283 --> 38:53.374
It is time to rebuild myself,
my company and my legacy.

38:54.419 --> 38:55.985
Cheers.

38:58.988 --> 39:02.122
I am so sorry
for what my mother said.

39:02.165 --> 39:05.081
She deserved a lot more
than a slap in the face.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.693
Well, she'll get what she's owed eventually.

39:07.736 --> 39:10.913
And as much as I love you
for checking in on me,

39:10.957 --> 39:12.915
sometimes I forget to see
how you're doing.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.048
Oh, Fallon, I'm fine.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.615
Okay? I just want
to be here for you.

39:16.658 --> 39:18.007
And I appreciate that,

39:18.051 --> 39:20.662
but I'm not the only one
going through this.

39:21.794 --> 39:23.317
We're a team.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.406
Look, it does hurt,

39:25.450 --> 39:27.800
you know, to imagine
not starting a family with you.

39:27.843 --> 39:29.628
Well, that's I wanted
to talk to you about.

39:30.759 --> 39:33.588
How do you feel...

39:33.632 --> 39:34.807
about surrogacy?

39:36.809 --> 39:38.506
I just want to have a baby
with you.

39:38.550 --> 39:41.466
Okay? I don't care
how he or she gets here.

39:41.509 --> 39:42.858
You're okay with this?

39:42.902 --> 39:44.207
Yeah.

39:44.251 --> 39:45.818
I mean, our lives have
never gone as planned.

39:45.861 --> 39:46.993
We got married in
my high school theater

39:47.036 --> 39:48.124
where a guy held me
at knifepoint

39:48.168 --> 39:50.083
and accused me of
killing his sister,

39:50.126 --> 39:52.564
so I feel like surrogacy will be
a piece of cake.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.392
Yeah, we never did get
our wedding pictures, did we?

39:56.045 --> 39:57.743
It's weird.

39:57.786 --> 40:00.441
Growing up as a Carrington,
asked for help was always seen

40:00.485 --> 40:02.182
as a sign of weakness,

40:02.225 --> 40:04.402
and then later used against you.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.186
And I really want
to break that cycle.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.101
So, we're doing this?

40:08.144 --> 40:10.364
- We're having a baby?
- We're having a baby.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.414
<i>I've waited all day.</i>

40:16.457 --> 40:17.719
I held up my end of the deal.

40:17.763 --> 40:20.896
I am a woman of my word.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.639
That email is drafted,
and I just need to hit "send."

40:24.683 --> 40:27.163
But, in the meantime,

40:27.207 --> 40:28.687
why don't we

40:28.730 --> 40:30.515
make ourselves
a little more comfortable.

40:30.558 --> 40:33.953
Uh... No, I-I'd prefer
to celebrate after.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.476
Oh, we will.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.609
Before...

40:42.048 --> 40:44.137
- ...and after.
- Wait, wait, how many of those injections

40:44.180 --> 40:46.269
did you give yourself?
D-Do you know what they can do?

40:46.313 --> 40:47.619
Don't worry.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.012
I am very in tune

40:50.056 --> 40:52.406
with what my body's
capable of handling.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.234
Wh-Whoa!

40:55.670 --> 40:57.890
Apparently your body is
not used to walking.

40:57.933 --> 41:00.196
All right.

41:01.284 --> 41:03.504
Up we go.

41:11.164 --> 41:14.689
This is exactly why I wanted
you to send that email first!

41:24.656 --> 41:26.266
Oh, come on.

41:27.397 --> 41:28.398
Unlock.

41:28.442 --> 41:31.358
Yep. Yes.

41:52.858 --> 41:54.816
I couldn't have done this
without you.
