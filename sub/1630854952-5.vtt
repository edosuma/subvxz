07:45.757 --> 07:47.217
You found her Instagram?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.718
Yeah, and I sent it
to all of you.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.969
You've never online stalked

07:49.969 --> 07:51.638
someone using
reverse image search

07:51.638 --> 07:53.181
with a screengrab
from Dad's computer?

07:53.181 --> 07:55.141
[incredulous mumbling]
Grow up, Noah.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.102
Look at her captions.
Look at her captions.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.312
"Live, laugh, lobster"?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.855
"It's taco o'clock-O."

08:00.855 --> 08:02.857
- "Carpe chocolate."
- Yikes.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.234
Oh, yeah,
that's a wrap on Brenda.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.694
Well, I think it's healthy

08:05.694 --> 08:07.529
that Dad is open
to companionship again.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.947
Nicky, if you're so worried,

08:08.947 --> 08:11.032
then let's ask Dad
to meet her over dinner.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.368
Ooh, dinner--
that is the perfect opportunity

08:13.368 --> 08:15.161
to stop this thing
before it gets more serious.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.871
Or this could be
an opportunity

08:16.871 --> 08:18.832
for you to give her a chance
and get to know her.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.709
Yeah.
Nah, I'ma go for my reason.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.168

for rushing over.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.716
Yeah, of course.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.009
Is everything okay?
What was the emergency?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.802
Kristen's auntie caught
the Holy Ghost at church

08:30.802 --> 08:32.345
and fell down a flight
of stairs.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.347
- Damn. I hope she's okay.
- She'll be fine. God's got it.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.850
The emergency is I have
to pick up Kristen from work,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.560
then I have to go to San Diego,

08:38.560 --> 08:40.812
but I need you
to take care of my plants.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.564
Are you for real?

08:42.564 --> 08:43.982
Why don't you just water them
right now?

08:43.982 --> 08:45.692
You think taking care
of plants

08:45.692 --> 08:46.860
is just putting water in a pot?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.236
I bet you think
that poinsettias need

08:48.236 --> 08:49.988
bright, direct sunlight--
well, they don't.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.198
They need bright,
indirect sunlight, idiot.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.159
- I can leave right now.
- No, no, no, no, no!

08:54.159 --> 08:55.493

I'm sorry.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.619

I need you. I'm sorry.
It's dad stuff.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.582
- You wouldn't get it.
- I came as soon as I could.

- It's his plants.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.462
- Are you freakin' kidding me?
- I'm sorry.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.797
It was last minute,
and I sent out a mass text.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.884
But at least now
you two can split the tasks.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.136
Tomorrow is watering day,

09:13.136 --> 09:14.679
of everything
that you need to do.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.514
It shouldn't take more
than four hours.

Where?

Rooms? Plural?

How many places did y'all have
sex in my house?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.844
and the kitchen as separate?

15:27.844 --> 15:29.554
'Cause the open floor plan's
a little confusing.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.097
- Oh, come on.
- Okay, we're sorry.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.891
But if you could keep this
between us,

15:32.891 --> 15:33.892
that would be great.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.143
Yeah, we're really trying

15:35.143 --> 15:36.686
to not make this
a whole thing-thing.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.813
Okay, but if it's not
a thing-thing,

15:38.813 --> 15:41.441
then what is it?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.068
both: Um...

15:43.068 --> 15:45.362
Look, I know I'm not the best
person to give advice on this.

15:45.362 --> 15:49.157
I'm just an old married
plant dad with 74 kids.

15:49.157 --> 15:52.619
But keeping it a secret
will only make it more

15:52.619 --> 15:54.204
of a thing-thing.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.334
Hey, you looking good.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.877
- Ready to go?
- [chuckles]

16:00.877 --> 16:02.504
Uh, actually, that's what
I want to talk to you about.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.255
Oh, okay.
We should be quick, though,

16:04.255 --> 16:06.007
because Elias' DJ set starts
in, like, 20.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.342
Right, well, first of all,

16:07.342 --> 16:09.177
I love how you and my son
have connected.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.012
Oh, yeah, for sure.
That's my guy.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.847
Uh, which makes
what I'm about to say

16:12.847 --> 16:14.224
a little bit harder.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.850
I just don't feel like
we're a match.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.560
Oh.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.853
Okay.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.814
I'm sorry, but I wanted
to be up front with you.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.233
Oh, no, no,
I-I appreciate your honesty.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.777
Um, I just hope
we can remain friends.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.655
I don't typically do that
with men I date.

16:28.655 --> 16:33.118
Oh, nah, I was talking
about me and Elias.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.412
Mmm, mmm, Franklin,

16:35.412 --> 16:40.041
baby, I know those cute little
toes of yours must be tired

16:40.041 --> 16:42.919
because you put both
of your feet in this cake, too.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.380
[both laughing]

16:45.380 --> 16:47.465
Don't make me laugh
while I'm eating my dessert.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.259
[laughs sarcastically]
What fun.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.803
- Let me get your plate.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.430
Oh, yeah. No worries.

16:53.430 --> 16:54.556
- Oh, oh, no.
- Oh.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.891
Nicky, you are so clumsy.
[chuckles]

16:56.891 --> 16:58.560
- Let me help.
- Oh, I'll get it. Don't worry.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.145
No, no, no.
We insist.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.147
[giggles]

17:02.147 --> 17:04.274
- [bag rustling]
- Wait a minute.

17:04.274 --> 17:06.568
What is this?

17:06.568 --> 17:08.611
Is this...

17:08.611 --> 17:11.114
both: Reefer?

17:11.114 --> 17:12.490
I've never seen it up close.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.159
But, yeah, this looks like

17:14.159 --> 17:17.078
the images I saw
on my D.A.R.E. program.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.788
Oh, that is reefer.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.374
- Brenda, is this yours?
- What? No. That's not my weed.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.709
You can't believe a word

17:22.709 --> 17:24.586
that comes out
of her dope-smoking mouth, Dad.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.587
I'm disgusted.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.629
Franklin, look,
I swear to God.

17:26.629 --> 17:28.256
I don't know
what they talking about.

17:28.256 --> 17:31.551
That is not my weed.
This is my weed.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.927
- Uh, what?
- Yeah.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.679
Prescription, extra-strength.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.557
I'm sorry.
I'm very confused.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.434
If this isn't your reefer,

17:39.434 --> 17:41.186
whose reefer is this?

17:46.733 --> 17:47.567
I can't believe
both my children

17:48.360 --> 17:49.611
brought reefer into my home.

17:49.611 --> 17:50.945
- Brenda did, too.
- Yeah.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.365
- She has a prescription.
- Yeah, doctor's orders.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.116
You know, you two smoking
reefer is one thing,

17:55.116 --> 17:58.328
but why would you try
and frame Brenda?

17:58.328 --> 17:59.579
No reason.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.374
Yeah, we're just shaking
things up.

18:02.374 --> 18:05.168
Fine. We just don't thing
Brenda's right for you at all.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.795
Well, that's too bad, missy,

18:06.795 --> 18:09.255
'cause that's my man
and I'm his woman.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.632
- Brenda, hold on.
- Baby, I'm sorry.

18:10.632 --> 18:11.883
I'm just a little high
right now.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.551
I don't think Brenda's right
for me either.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.636
- both: What?
- Say what now?

18:14.636 --> 18:16.179
Wait, you said
that she was, like,

18:16.179 --> 18:18.014
special and she was on her way
to becoming your girlfriend.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.140
So, like, what?

18:19.140 --> 18:20.517
Because I was
too uncomfortable

18:20.517 --> 18:23.228
to tell my daughter
the real reason I like Brenda.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.521
Oh, God.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.064
Wait.
I don't--I don't understand.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.399
What--what's the real reason?

18:27.399 --> 18:28.858
Yeah, what's the real reason?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.735
[sighs] Sex.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.320
- both: Oh, no.
- What? What?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.364
Wait a minute.
This has been about sex?

18:34.364 --> 18:36.282
But you introduced me
to your children.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.492
I didn't want to.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.160
They were the ones
that wanted to meet you.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.662
Oh, God.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.497
But you were laughing so hard
at all her weird jokes.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.165
- Sex.
- The sex, Noah.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.500
- Oh, no.
- Wait a minute.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.585
But you said
that you've never been happier.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.087
- Sex, Brenda.
- You know what?

18:49.087 --> 18:52.298
Well, I hope you like
having sex by yourself.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.593
Oh, God.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.470
So your dad was just trying
to get some booty?

18:57.470 --> 18:58.847
Man, that's messed up.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.890
I would never do that
to my mama.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.642
I'm sorry.
Who he?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.519
Oh, this is
my ex's son, Elias.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.396
So you two are just
full-on friends now?

19:06.396 --> 19:07.814
- Absolutely.
- That's my dog.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.692
Nicky, Noah, it sounds like,
if you had just known

19:10.692 --> 19:12.694
that your father
was having casual sex,

19:12.694 --> 19:14.487
you could've avoided
this whole messy situation

19:14.487 --> 19:17.407
and it wouldn't have become
a whole thing-thing.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.867
What?
I think the lesson

19:18.867 --> 19:20.785
was that we shouldn't interfere
in our dad's business.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.997
Right, but everyone knowing
could've made things easier.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.665
No?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.834
Why are you looking
at Anthony and Fay?

19:27.834 --> 19:30.253
Oh, are you talking about them
blowing each other's backs out?

19:30.253 --> 19:31.796
Whoa!
Wait a minute.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.381
- You knew about that?
- Mm-hmm.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.258
Yeah, I told Nicky.
I'm sorry.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.801
Oh.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.845
- It's cool. I told Sherm.
- And I told Elias.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.680
Yeah.
I'm happy for you guys.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.557
- both: Thanks.
- Wait, so me and Noah

19:42.557 --> 19:44.225
are the only ones
that didn't know about this?

19:44.225 --> 19:45.894
Oh, I knew. Nicky told me.

19:45.894 --> 19:46.978
Oh, so it's just me?

19:46.978 --> 19:48.104
- Wow.
- Yeah, man.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.564
But did you hear
that they had sex

19:49.564 --> 19:51.399
at some guy
named Wyatt's house?

19:51.399 --> 19:52.984
That's me.
I am Wyatt.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.444
Oh, word?

19:54.444 --> 19:55.987
Nice to meet you, man.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.575
Well, everybody knows
about us now, so that's nice.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.494
Yeah, it is nice.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.746
But what exactly do they know?

20:04.746 --> 20:08.833
I mean,
what are we even doing here?

20:08.833 --> 20:11.044
Uh...

20:11.044 --> 20:13.088
- Oh, well, I was--
- Relax.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.673
I'm just messing with you.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.341
- [chuckles]
- We're hooking up.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.926
It's cool.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.719
[laughs]

20:19.719 --> 20:21.096
Yeah.

20:21.096 --> 20:22.972
Yeah, it's cool.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.349
Yeah.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.143
Do you want to say sorry
first, or you want me to?

20:27.143 --> 20:29.437
- You say it first.
- Fine.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.856
Noah, Nicky,
what are you doing here?

20:31.856 --> 20:34.150
Well, we just came by
to say that we're sorry.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.069
But mostly Nicky,
because she was the ringleader

20:36.069 --> 20:37.570
in all of this. Ow.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.572
It just freaks me out
to see you dating again.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.991
I know, and that's why
I never looked to get serious

20:41.991 --> 20:44.369
with anyone
since your mother died.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.578
I wouldn't want to be
with someone else

20:45.578 --> 20:46.955
if it meant upsetting you.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.248
That's really sweet,

20:48.248 --> 20:50.375
but it makes me feel
kind of selfish?

20:50.375 --> 20:51.543
Because it is
kind of selfish.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.627
- Come on.
- Ow.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.295
Look, I don't want
to keep you

20:54.295 --> 20:56.589
from moving on--
you deserve to be happy.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.008
I want you to find somebody.

20:58.008 --> 21:00.677
But until it's serious,
I'ma stay out your business.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.303
Perfect, so let's continue

21:02.303 --> 21:04.305
this conversation
tomorrow, yeah?

21:04.305 --> 21:06.391
Wait, Dad.
Where are you going?

21:06.391 --> 21:07.809
And why are you
in such a hurry?

21:07.809 --> 21:11.354
The reason is something
"not serious."

21:11.354 --> 21:12.647
- Oh, God.
- You guys got back together?

21:12.647 --> 21:13.898
Brenda's in there.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.150
It's your fault
for coming by unannounced.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.401
It's 2:00 p.m.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.777
When you coming
back in, zaddy?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.529
- [groans]
- Okay, we're out of here.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.156
Don't thumbs-up him.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.450
You know what? I used
to think Dad was more like me,

21:23.450 --> 21:25.035
but turns out,
he's much more like you.

21:25.035 --> 21:28.246
I know, but never, ever say
that to me again--ugh!

21:28.246 --> 21:30.331
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:30.331 --> 21:32.417
<i>- Not a doctor.</i>
- Shh.
