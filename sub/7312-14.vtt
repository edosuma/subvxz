WEBVTT

00:03.394 --> 00:05.614
Captain?

00:05.657 --> 00:08.617
Notification
from Fleet Command.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.792
Change of assignment.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.837
Carry on.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.970
We're heading for the East Sea

00:14.014 --> 00:16.059
to monitor the North Korean
activity off the coast.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.626
Wake Commander
Reynolds.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.497
Tell him to meet
me on the bridge.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.021
Aye, aye, sir.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.935
[sighs]

00:29.072 --> 00:31.205
I'm trying
to get this ship underway.

00:31.248 --> 00:34.077
What the hell's so important
the XO can't come to me?

00:36.253 --> 00:38.429
Where's the commander?

00:38.473 --> 00:40.301
Is there a problem,
Mr. Howard?

00:40.344 --> 00:41.998
I just found him, sir.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.691
As you know, Director,
your team is long overdue

01:22.734 --> 01:25.868
for their mandatory
psych evaluations.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.435
I'm aware that they've
been rescheduled.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.437
Nine times, to
be specific.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.134
And I spoke to
your in-house

01:31.178 --> 01:32.353
psych service unit--

01:32.396 --> 01:33.615
no time for
them either.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.486
If I didn't
know any better,

01:35.530 --> 01:37.445
I'd say that you
were avoiding us.

01:37.488 --> 01:40.012
Oh, cases take priority.

01:40.056 --> 01:43.407
Some would say that's--
I don't know-- shortsighted.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.627
Well, the victims'
families wouldn't.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.846
Agents need to be
at the top of their game.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.152
And my agents always are.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.849
I've read the reports.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.590
You were just
hospitalized.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.071
Agent Gibbs resigned
at one point.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.639
Agents DiNozzo and McGee
were held captive.

01:57.682 --> 02:00.598
They were rescuing Agent David.

02:00.642 --> 02:03.253
Did they receive
posttraumatic treatment?

02:03.297 --> 02:05.647
Initial assessments
were conducted,

02:05.690 --> 02:07.518
and they were all
deemed fit for duty.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.781
Optimistic, but doubtful.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.438
My colleagues and
I have been hearing

02:14.482 --> 02:16.919
about your team for years.

02:16.962 --> 02:19.313
SECNAV's concerned, so
I'd like to get started

02:19.356 --> 02:21.271
today, if that's
convenient for you.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.795
If it's not?
I promise that I
won't be intrusive.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.189
I prefer to be out in the
field when I evaluate,

02:26.233 --> 02:28.757
so your team should not
experience any down time.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.324
It, uh, should be painless.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.674
Oh, I'm not worried about them.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.458
You, on the other hand...

02:34.502 --> 02:36.286
Skin's thicker than it looks.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.288
So, who should I start with?

02:38.332 --> 02:40.290
Pardon?
In your opinion,

02:40.334 --> 02:41.726
who has the most to talk about?

02:46.470 --> 02:48.124
Where did you get that money?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.821
Ever heard of a trifecta?

02:49.865 --> 02:53.042
I do not want to hear
about your threesomes.

02:53.085 --> 02:54.174
I went to the track.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.436
Pimlico.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.002
Three ponies.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.221
Win, place and show.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.223
What did they show you?

03:00.267 --> 03:02.007
Show. Means they came in third.

03:02.051 --> 03:03.661
What made you

03:03.705 --> 03:05.533
pick these horses?

03:05.576 --> 03:07.752
A keen mind,

03:07.796 --> 03:10.407
an eye for natural talent,
a little bit of luck,

03:10.451 --> 03:13.497
and of course,
they spoke to me.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.499
Who spoke to you?

03:15.543 --> 03:17.284
The horses.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.895
The ponies. I whisper to them,
they whisper to me.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.637
Actually, no. You can
study 'em before the race.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.291
The ones that really want
to win-- they do

03:24.334 --> 03:26.162
this little dance,
little snorting.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.512
[whinnies]

03:28.556 --> 03:31.211
[spluttering,
whinnying]

03:31.254 --> 03:32.212
[spluttering]

03:32.255 --> 03:34.431
[whinnying]

03:34.475 --> 03:36.477
Tony, you may want
to stop acting like a jackass.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.000
That's not an ass.
It's a hor... hor...

03:39.306 --> 03:40.959
I can explain, sir.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.789
Settle in, Doctor.
This should be good.

03:46.574 --> 03:47.836
[whispers]:
Doctor?

03:47.879 --> 03:48.967
VANCE:
Agents, this is

03:49.011 --> 03:50.534
Dr. Rachel Cranston.

03:50.578 --> 03:51.709
She's here for
your mandatory

03:51.753 --> 03:53.711
psych evaluations.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.539
Who's ready to talk?

03:55.583 --> 03:57.019
No. Can't talk here.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.935
We got a dead commander
on the USS Colonial.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.372
Dr. Cranston is here to
observe your team, Agent Gibbs.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.374
Huh.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.768
Not much to see.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.248
Really.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.946
I'll be the judge of that.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.991
Okay.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.124
Everybody, the
doctor's in.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.647
Go!

04:25.047 --> 04:28.006
GIBBS:
This stateroom
been compromised, Captain?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.312
No, nothing's
been touched.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.357
Who found
the body?

04:30.400 --> 04:31.619
Ensign Howard.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.664
I called the XO
to the bridge.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.753
Howard was sent to get him.

04:35.797 --> 04:39.017
TONY: Listen, Doc, about my,
uh, Man O' War impression...

04:39.061 --> 04:40.367
I thought it was Secretariat.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.846
[laughs]
Yeah.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.718
I was just trying
to lighten the mood.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.328
You know, I entertain
the coworkers.

04:45.372 --> 04:48.462
Why do you feel lightening
the mood is your responsibility?

04:48.505 --> 04:50.551
Well, who else
has the chops?

04:50.594 --> 04:52.466
Not to mention the talent.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.858
[laughs]

04:53.902 --> 04:55.860
Uh, yeah, you're
good, aren't you?

04:55.904 --> 04:58.298
Gently unscrewing
the noggin, huh?

04:58.341 --> 05:01.388
Hmm. Let me ask
you something,

05:01.431 --> 05:03.999
verySpecial Agent DiNozzo.

05:04.042 --> 05:06.654
Was there ever a time when
someone didn't approve

05:06.697 --> 05:08.090
of that behavior
from you?

05:08.133 --> 05:09.352
[laughs]

05:09.396 --> 05:11.267
Not gonna happen.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.098
McGEE:
A lot of blood.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.360
Must've clipped
an artery.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.189
You find
a weapon yet?

05:20.232 --> 05:22.670
No. Start looking.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.280
DUCKY:
Confounded ships are like

05:24.324 --> 05:25.890
laboratory mazes.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.371
I always feel
like a white rat

05:28.415 --> 05:30.373
in search
of a tasty treat.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.419
GIBBS:
So, what do you think, Duck?Someone shot him.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.942
Yeah, well,
there's a start.

05:33.985 --> 05:36.118
At close proximity.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.033
Through and through.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.469
The slug should still

05:39.513 --> 05:40.731
be in his bunk.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.646
Uh, Agent McGee,
help me turn him,

05:42.690 --> 05:45.910
so that Agent David
can take a look.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.825
There's no gun here.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.437
The slug is still
in the mattress.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.394
GIBBS:
I found a shell casing.

05:52.569 --> 05:56.617
That's a Tokarev 25.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.749
Mostly used by
Koreans and Russians.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.099
Captain, you got
some visitors on board?

06:01.143 --> 06:04.929
Uh, seven, including a group
of international journalists.

06:04.973 --> 06:07.105
Anyone know about
the commander's murder yet?

06:07.149 --> 06:08.803
McGEE:
Uh, boss?

06:13.764 --> 06:15.940
Extra, extra,
read all about it.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.560
Yes, sir. I understand.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.170
Yeah, I-I do. I...

06:28.213 --> 06:30.607
We will, as soon
as possible. Thank you.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.826
That was SECNAV.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.132
Colonial'son lockdown.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.874
You figure out who
leaked the story?
No, not yet.

06:36.918 --> 06:40.443
Got two English reporters
on board the ship; two French,

06:40.487 --> 06:41.792
one South Korean.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.490
They were all
with Navy personnel

06:43.533 --> 06:45.274
at the time
of the shooting, except

06:45.317 --> 06:47.232
Min Ho Kwon.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.582
Bullet connects him.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.800
He's a career journalist.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.715
He served four years
in the Korean military.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.456
Okay. We're on it.

06:53.500 --> 06:57.199
SECNAV is waiting for
that team evaluation, Gibbs.

06:57.242 --> 07:00.202
Technically, until Dr. Cranston
finishes that report,

07:00.245 --> 07:02.378
we're not cleared
to operate in the field.

07:02.422 --> 07:06.121
What do you want us
to do, Leon, go home?

07:06.164 --> 07:08.079
I want you to give the doctor
your full support.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.211
Already am.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.692
A bad report can lead
to change, Gibbs.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.694
Record speaks for itself.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.565
The record may not be enough.

07:15.609 --> 07:19.221
We are who we are,
Director Vance.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.005
Don't I know it.

07:27.577 --> 07:30.145
Somebody, talk to me.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.495
Commander Vincent Reynolds
graduated Annapolis

07:32.539 --> 07:34.018
over 30 years ago.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.367
ZIVA: Served with distinction
in the Sixth

07:35.411 --> 07:37.108
and Seventh Fleets
for the past two decades.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.980
McGEE:
Just 18 months away

07:39.023 --> 07:41.069
from retirement when he died.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.549
Uh, single, never married,
no children.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.638
According to Captain Lynn,
Reynolds was pals

07:44.681 --> 07:47.205
with Admiral
Wayne Hargrove.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.164
TONY:
Hargrove's overseeing operations
in the Far East, aboard the

07:49.207 --> 07:50.470
flagship USS Blue Ridge.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.558
Find out if Reynolds is doing

07:51.601 --> 07:52.384
any side work for the admiral.

07:53.951 --> 07:57.781
And all of you,
make some time

07:57.825 --> 07:59.130
for the doctor.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.305
Director Vance's orders.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.916
What are we supposed
to talk about?

08:01.959 --> 08:03.004
CRANSTON:
Well, believe it or not,

08:03.047 --> 08:04.745
most people talk
about the sex lives.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.181
That rules Tim out.

08:06.224 --> 08:09.576
I will certainly remain
professional.

08:09.619 --> 08:12.535
Well, since you're so confident
what you'll be discussing,

08:12.579 --> 08:14.319
Agent David, why not start now?

08:14.363 --> 08:16.496
[wry laugh]

08:21.892 --> 08:23.720
All right, just have a seat.

08:25.461 --> 08:28.290
Hey, I'm a journalist and
a South Korean citizen.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.292
I demand to
be released.

08:30.335 --> 08:33.121
You know how you can tell
if a horse is nervous?

08:33.164 --> 08:34.818
What?

08:34.862 --> 08:37.473
They twitch, get a little
weird look in their eye.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.257
You got one of those
right now.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.956
Well... you have no
right to detain me.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.566
Actually, we do,
'cause we're in the middle

08:43.610 --> 08:45.655
of a murder investigation,
so why don't you sit down?

08:45.699 --> 08:48.092
I'll get to you
when I'm ready.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.142
Your instincts are spot-on.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.839
He did it.

08:55.883 --> 08:59.234
Well, you cracked the case
awful fast, Petty Officer...

08:59.277 --> 09:01.279
Oliver.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.804
Why do you think
this guy killed your XO?

09:03.847 --> 09:05.283
Because I saw him

09:05.327 --> 09:07.024
and Commander Reynolds
arguing last night.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.505
The Korean
wouldn't back down.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.638
Eventually,
the XO walked away.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.423
Thank you.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.387
Now, why exactly
are we doing this?

09:22.431 --> 09:24.868
We are just talking,
just getting to know each other.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.783
Okay, but I do not need
to know you,

09:26.827 --> 09:29.046
and this is actually taking time
away from my work.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.439
Sometimes, a little
time away from work

09:30.482 --> 09:31.614
is a really good thing.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.877
I do admire your
dedication, though.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.706
Dedication is important to me.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.926
Hasn't that been something
that you've been, uh,

09:38.969 --> 09:40.057
juggling your whole life?

09:40.101 --> 09:42.494
I... I... I do not know
what you mean.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.626
Juggling dedication to, uh,

09:43.670 --> 09:49.066
family, to country,
to job, uh...

09:49.110 --> 09:51.895
ZIVA: Why was I not told the details of his mission?

09:51.939 --> 09:53.636
Why was I excluded?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.507
ELI:
Because, Ziva,

09:55.551 --> 09:59.120
I don't know who you answer to
anymore-- NCIS or Mossad.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.165
What is it you expect from me?

10:01.209 --> 10:04.908
I expect your loyalty...
to me and onlyme.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.301
[echoing]:
Only me!

10:06.344 --> 10:08.651
I do not understand
how this is relevant to what

10:08.695 --> 10:10.087
you need to know.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.133
It tells me
something about you.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.874
About what brought you here.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.223
About where you came from.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.704
When you first
came here,

10:17.747 --> 10:20.968
you, uh, replaced someone.

10:21.011 --> 10:24.536
Yes. Special Agent
Caitlin Todd.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.234
Mm.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.715
She was killed
in the line of duty.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.238
Had you ever met Agent Todd?

10:30.281 --> 10:33.241
No, and I know that
her loss was, uh,

10:33.284 --> 10:38.942
significant to NCIS.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.465
Anyone have a key for this?

10:40.509 --> 10:41.684
It's Kate's desk.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.860
Okay, but if I'm
going to be a part

10:43.904 --> 10:45.514
of your team, I
would love to...

10:45.557 --> 10:47.821
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're part of our team?

10:47.864 --> 10:49.344
Yes.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.306
She's gone, Gibbs.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.483
I don't think Kate will mind.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.053
It's always
very difficult

11:03.097 --> 11:04.359
filling someone
else's shoes.

11:06.274 --> 11:10.104
No disrespect, Doctor,

11:10.147 --> 11:11.322
but except
from the fact

11:11.366 --> 11:12.759
that she was...

11:12.802 --> 11:14.543
a woman...

11:14.586 --> 11:16.632
we are very different agents.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.720
Oh, I can tell that

11:17.764 --> 11:19.679
individuality's
very important to you.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.290
Are you... that discerning
when it comes to men, as well?

11:22.333 --> 11:24.335
Keeping your
personal and

11:24.379 --> 11:25.685
professional lives
in balance is,

11:25.728 --> 11:27.164
is important.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.950
And it looks like some men,

11:29.993 --> 11:32.561
over the years, have, uh...

11:33.954 --> 11:36.434
influenced your work.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.307
My work has never been affected

11:39.350 --> 11:40.961
and this is
none of your business.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.876
Actually, it is.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.269
You thought I would not
identify Michael Rifkin

11:45.313 --> 11:46.923
as a Mossad operative.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.273
So you think you did
the right thing?Okay.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.494
Are you, by any chance,
questioning my loyalty?

11:52.537 --> 11:54.365
I am questioning why
you didn't tell them

11:54.409 --> 11:55.758
you saw him three days ago.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.804
Are you jealous?

11:57.847 --> 11:59.240
He was playing you, Ziva.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.850
You killed him!He attacked me!

12:00.894 --> 12:01.764
What was I supposed--

12:04.071 --> 12:05.637
You put fire
in his chest!

12:05.681 --> 12:07.901
You... weren't... there.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.206
But I should have been!

12:09.250 --> 12:10.207
[panting]

12:10.251 --> 12:11.426
You loved him.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.127
The-the-the thing
that puzzles me...

12:17.171 --> 12:19.782
with all this change...

12:19.826 --> 12:21.436
of allegiance to country

12:21.479 --> 12:23.438
of the type of men
you're drawn to,

12:23.481 --> 12:25.875
what is it
that you're looking for?

12:25.919 --> 12:28.399
What is it that you want?

12:34.841 --> 12:37.887
[sighs]

12:39.802 --> 12:43.632
I want...

12:43.675 --> 12:45.721
something...

12:45.765 --> 12:46.766
permanent.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.726
Something that can't
be taken away.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.688
[voice breaks]:
Is that too much to ask?

13:04.696 --> 13:06.655
Murder. Really.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.572
[sighs]

13:10.615 --> 13:12.835
I'll have to tell
my wife Nancy.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.837
Vincent was like family to us.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.708
Really.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.276
Even after you skyrocketed
up the ranks?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.975
I'm not sure I follow,
Agent Gibbs.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.107
Vincent Reynolds was
just a commander, Admiral.

13:24.151 --> 13:27.110
You're an admiral, Admiral.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.547
[wry laugh]

13:29.591 --> 13:31.680
Yeah, well, Vincent always knew

13:31.723 --> 13:33.856
that, uh, he had the gift
of leadership much more

13:33.900 --> 13:34.857
than political savvy.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.772
And, uh...

13:36.816 --> 13:38.165
he had a bad habit

13:38.208 --> 13:40.167
of telling people
what he really thought.And...

13:40.210 --> 13:41.690
if an aggressive journalist

13:41.733 --> 13:42.822
pushed the commander,

13:42.865 --> 13:43.997
would he have pushed back?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.520
And then some, yeah.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.699
MAN:
Well, then, how can I
prove my innocence?

13:50.742 --> 13:52.266
An alibi
would be nice.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.442
[sighs]

13:54.485 --> 13:56.052
TONY: Commander Reynolds
was killed last night,

13:56.096 --> 13:57.401
at approximately
2:00 a.m.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.186
I was in my stateroom.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.796
Doing what?
My actions

14:00.840 --> 14:02.624
are not
your concern!
On a U.S.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.670
naval vessel, they
sure as hell are.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.020
You're about
to be accused

14:07.063 --> 14:08.499
of murdering an
American officer!

14:10.501 --> 14:12.634
Do you understand
what's at stake here?

14:15.028 --> 14:17.682
Heck of a powder keg.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.859
What are you,
the fuse?!

14:22.339 --> 14:24.298
All right, I'll negotiate.

14:24.341 --> 14:25.299
Like hell you will.

14:25.342 --> 14:26.909
Not on my watch.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.171
See ya in prison.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.870
I was sending e-mails!

14:36.788 --> 14:39.008
E-mails?

14:39.052 --> 14:41.924
I sent them through a series
of encoded signals

14:41.968 --> 14:43.491
unencrypted by a sub
off the coast.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.885
Well, then we'll need
the name of the sub.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.452
I cannot.
They'll kill me.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.932
I wouldn't be so worried.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.020
South Korea's our ally.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.414
North Korea isn't.

14:54.850 --> 14:58.462
Time stamps on the e-mails
will prove my innocence.

14:58.506 --> 15:01.552
I was sending photographs
of your weapons systems.

15:01.596 --> 15:02.945
Arrest me for espionage.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.339
At home, they'll
call me a hero.

15:05.382 --> 15:09.299
But I swear I'm not a murderer.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.356
Good morning.
You're avoiding me.

15:22.399 --> 15:25.359
Doc, I gotta say I've never
been a big fan.

15:25.402 --> 15:28.144
Of me, personally,
or psychiatrists?

15:28.188 --> 15:31.539
Of course, my being
a woman doesn't help either.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.236
What's that supposed
to mean?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.717
I know you historically
you have issues with
professional women.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.241
No, I like women.
I just just don't like 'em

15:38.285 --> 15:40.026
when they ask
a lot of questions.

15:43.681 --> 15:46.032
Hey, Gibbs.
I've confirmed that the casing

15:46.075 --> 15:48.034
was a Tokarev .25-millimeter,

15:48.077 --> 15:52.647
fired from a Russian-made
either TT-30 or a TT-33.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.215
Oh, hello.

15:56.607 --> 15:57.957
Shrinkola?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.784
Keep going, Abbs.

15:59.828 --> 16:03.266
Um, the markings
on the rounds

16:03.310 --> 16:05.181
indicate that the weapon
is older.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.140
Collector's item?Maybe.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.445
Hey, what, what are you doing?

16:08.489 --> 16:09.838
Are you writing stuff about me?

16:09.881 --> 16:12.449
Just a question I want
to remember to ask later.

16:12.493 --> 16:13.755
Do not let me interrupt.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.105
Well, it's too late
for that, Sigmund.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.802
Abbs...

16:17.846 --> 16:19.761
I have been
scouring the Web

16:19.804 --> 16:21.676
and local gun show
listings

16:21.719 --> 16:23.765
for TT-30 sales

16:23.808 --> 16:25.549
or registered buyers--
so far, I have 28.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.724
Is, is that a lot?

16:29.205 --> 16:33.166
Of the 250,000 registered
firearms owners in

16:33.209 --> 16:35.951
the metro area, 28 is peanuts.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.605
I'll get you the rest

16:37.648 --> 16:39.433
of the details
when I have them.
Thanks.

16:44.829 --> 16:49.356
Trust me, honey, you don't have
enough hours in the day.

16:49.399 --> 16:52.098
I'll find the time,
Ms. Sciuto.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.230
Don't you worry.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.018
I don't like
head doctors.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.932
No one does, Anthony.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.848
They're like
lie-detector tests.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.895
They alert us
to our fears

17:06.938 --> 17:08.331
and weaknesses.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.637
I especially don't like
this one.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.030
She's always judging me.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.119
All right, well, obviously
that's where

17:13.162 --> 17:14.468
the powder burns were.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.078
The gun was held close.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.515
Yeah, with
a tremendous pressure.

17:18.559 --> 17:21.344
Note the bruising
from the barrel on
the commander's chest.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.868
I also found a residue
on his knuckles

17:23.912 --> 17:27.133
that I sent up to Abby
and a severely broken nail
on his right hand

17:27.176 --> 17:30.484
and hairline fractures on
his index and middle fingers.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.486
Defensive wound?

17:32.529 --> 17:35.706
Possibly, yeah.
The question remains,

17:35.750 --> 17:38.883
why was the gunshot
angle not higher?

17:38.927 --> 17:41.016
I mean, the shooter was
standing right over him.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.800
[door hisses open]

17:42.844 --> 17:45.847
Oh!

17:45.890 --> 17:48.110
Sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

17:48.154 --> 17:48.980
Just came to say hello.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.330
Hello.
[chuckles]

17:50.373 --> 17:51.461
Good-bye.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.202
You don't have to leave,
Agent DiNozzo.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.030
I do if you stay.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.989
You seem to have sparked
quite a reaction in him.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.122
Yeah, occupational hazard.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.950
I have that effect on people.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.995
I warn you, Doctor,

18:04.039 --> 18:06.433
if your intent is to get inside
my brain,

18:06.476 --> 18:08.609
you will be unsuccessful.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.351
I know all the tricks
too well.

18:11.394 --> 18:14.267
Dr. Mallard,
you are the least

18:14.310 --> 18:16.834
of my concerns...
for now.

18:16.878 --> 18:21.926
And what, pray tell,
does that mean?

18:21.970 --> 18:27.236
It means for the time being,
you seem remarkably balanced.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.195
I appreciate the compliment,
Doctor.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.110
Nonetheless,

18:31.153 --> 18:34.591
dare I say the long
hours and isolation

18:34.635 --> 18:36.680
occasionally take their toll.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.900
You aren't alone, Doctor.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.989
You got drawers full of people
who keep you company.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.078
And they are exceptional
listeners.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.645
Nonetheless...

18:47.082 --> 18:50.085
...there are times
when I find myself,

18:50.129 --> 18:53.741
well... melancholy.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.920
Well, you aren't getting
any younger.

18:58.963 --> 19:02.402
I'm sure you recognize
the irony

19:02.445 --> 19:05.187
of quietly facing
the dead every day.

19:05.231 --> 19:11.802
Not only do I recognize
the irony, I embrace it.

19:16.024 --> 19:19.027
I appreciate your keeping me
covered in front of the others,

19:19.070 --> 19:20.898
especially Tony.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.466
Yes, I know how modest you are.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.207
[chuckles]

19:25.251 --> 19:26.469
Were.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.645
I'm dead now, Ducky.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.259
Shouldn't be.

19:33.302 --> 19:36.044
However...

19:37.828 --> 19:41.049
I am not quite ready
for assisted living.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.747
Now if you will excuse me,

19:43.791 --> 19:45.575
the commander is
getting impatient.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.886
Okay, McGee, talk.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.496
Well, Abby just called.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.759
She narrowed down
the list of TT-30

19:55.803 --> 19:58.545
and TT-33 buyers
who registered guns.

19:58.588 --> 20:01.548
One name popped up:
Seaman Marcus Leonard.

20:01.591 --> 20:04.551
Requested mast against
Commander Reynolds,
three months ago,

20:04.594 --> 20:06.944
for inappropriate
conduct.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.859
Leonard's still in
normal duty status,

20:08.903 --> 20:10.687
but he lives alone
in his deceased parents' home

20:10.731 --> 20:11.993
in Shadyside, Virginia.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.082
Okay, go.
All right.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.479
Boss, you coming?

20:19.522 --> 20:21.568
No. Take Dr. Cranston.
Let her drive.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.352
You can lie down.

20:23.396 --> 20:24.701
Shrinks love that, McGee.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.403
Where are we going,
Agent McGee?

20:30.446 --> 20:31.839
Potential suspect's house.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.450
So, doing field work
without Agent DiNozzo

20:34.494 --> 20:38.237
must be invigorating.
Puts you in charge.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.629
Yeah, I'll admit,

20:39.673 --> 20:41.544
it does feel pretty good
sometimes, yeah.

20:41.588 --> 20:46.680
You were the one
who didn't start out

20:46.723 --> 20:48.725
in the military
or law enforcement.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.859
The only one with
an Ivy League education,

20:51.902 --> 20:53.295
yet you successfully
transformed

20:53.339 --> 20:56.124
from probie
to Special Agent.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.648
Who told you about probie?

20:58.692 --> 21:01.521
I'm one of you guys now, right?
No more,

21:01.564 --> 21:03.653
no more getting coffee,
no more hazing?

21:03.697 --> 21:05.742
Sure.
Sure.All right.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.963
[mockingly]:
"Puh-ro-o-bie."

21:11.052 --> 21:13.054
You've done an amazing
job of growing,

21:13.097 --> 21:14.882
you're technically astute.

21:14.925 --> 21:18.842
Something feels, uh... stunted.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.801
Stunted?

21:20.844 --> 21:22.193
How?

21:22.237 --> 21:24.500
Women. Deep down,

21:24.544 --> 21:26.633
wouldn't you like to be in
a committed relationship?

21:28.635 --> 21:30.463
Would you maybe want

21:30.506 --> 21:32.334
to get some coffee together
one morning?

21:32.378 --> 21:34.902
Yeah. Um, sure.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.208
You're asking me to dinner?

21:37.252 --> 21:38.993
You know, you doing what you do,

21:39.036 --> 21:40.299
it's, uh,
it's interesting to me.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.952
I'd like to know more.

21:41.996 --> 21:44.738
Yeah, but, um, I don't
think you really would.

21:46.479 --> 21:49.569
You're hiding something,
and I seek it. Speak.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.527
I've been seeing this girl.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.399
Oh. That's nice.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.835
Actually,
it's not nice.

21:54.878 --> 21:57.577
She, uh, stole my mail
and took out

21:57.620 --> 22:00.406
$65,000 in preapproved
credit cards in my name.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.364
Throw her psycho
ass in the brig.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.235
I love you, McGee.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.109
That should be enough.

22:08.152 --> 22:11.373
You know, I guess I just haven't
found the right girl yet.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.635
Maybe.

22:12.679 --> 22:15.812
Or maybe you're
looking too hard.

22:16.987 --> 22:18.728
Huh.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.643
CRANSTON: You-you
can do this?

22:22.645 --> 22:25.039
With a warrant.

22:25.082 --> 22:27.171
All right, wait out here.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.140
NCIS!

22:39.183 --> 22:42.839
Anyone home?

22:42.883 --> 22:44.232
I thought you said
the suspect was still

22:44.275 --> 22:45.494
on board the Colonial.He is,

22:45.538 --> 22:46.713
but it's still
protocol to check.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.018
Didn't I tell you
to wait outside?

22:48.062 --> 22:49.672
Psychiatrists never listen.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.587
No paintings

22:51.631 --> 22:52.980
of clowns on the walls.

22:53.023 --> 22:55.025
[laughing]: I guess
that's a good sign, huh?

23:06.254 --> 23:07.690
Well, care
to analyze this, Doctor?

23:10.954 --> 23:13.870
What do you think--
gun nut?

23:13.914 --> 23:15.655
I was thinking
something more clinical,

23:15.698 --> 23:18.527
but gun nut works.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.791
Yeah.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.669
Damn right I requested mast.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.410
ZIVA: Seaman Leonard,
what was your complaint?

23:31.453 --> 23:33.629
XO played favorites.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.588
Guys he had high hopes for.

23:35.631 --> 23:36.763
I wasn't one of them.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.765
Maybe Commander Reynolds

23:38.808 --> 23:41.289
was just an excellent
judge of character.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.900
We'll never
know now, will we?

23:43.944 --> 23:47.164
[wry laugh]

23:47.208 --> 23:50.211
Can you tell me where
your Russian TT-30 is?

23:50.254 --> 23:52.996
Seems to be the only gun
missing from your house.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.476
Gave it to a friend.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.609
Guy in Ohio, collector.

23:56.652 --> 23:59.960
If he didn't file
the right paperwork,
it's not my problem.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.484
If the gun is no longer
in his possession,

24:02.528 --> 24:05.269
it is most certainly
your problem.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.238
Come on.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.935
[smacks machine]

24:18.979 --> 24:20.937
[rattles machine]

24:20.981 --> 24:22.025
[pounding
on machine]

24:23.940 --> 24:26.813
It's frustrating,
isn't it?

24:29.555 --> 24:32.514
You make a choice,
follow directions, and...

24:32.558 --> 24:34.168
it still doesn't
work out.

24:34.211 --> 24:37.084
It's just a candy bar;
it's no big deal.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.216
Who said I was talking
about a candy bar?

24:39.260 --> 24:41.741
[guffaws]

24:41.784 --> 24:44.004
Okay... Doctor...

24:44.047 --> 24:46.180
You want to do this now?

24:46.223 --> 24:48.356
Why not?

24:48.399 --> 24:49.966
How far back do you want to go?

24:52.839 --> 24:54.014
My mom died
when I was eight.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.843
They sent me away to
school when I was 11.

24:56.886 --> 24:59.410
I almost lost that kid...

24:59.454 --> 25:01.064
in Baltimore.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.283
Are we doing it?

25:02.326 --> 25:03.589
Am I doing good?

25:03.632 --> 25:06.548
"Two roads diverged

25:06.592 --> 25:08.419
in a yellow wood..."

25:08.463 --> 25:11.510
and sorry I could not
travel both.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.816
DIRECTOR SHEPARD:
Another opportunity like this

25:13.860 --> 25:15.992
might not come up for years.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.298
These orders are for you.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.476
NCIS Rota, Spain?

25:21.520 --> 25:22.390
Your own team.

25:22.433 --> 25:25.045
Congratulations.

25:25.088 --> 25:28.048
I'm passing,
on the promotion, Jenny.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.617
We make decisions...

25:34.445 --> 25:35.925
and we live with them.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.233
Some decisions
are easier than others.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.715
[machine buzzes]

25:42.758 --> 25:44.151
[candy clunks]

25:46.327 --> 25:47.502
[scoffs]

25:51.593 --> 25:52.812
[knocking on door]

26:01.472 --> 26:03.692
That's the, uh,
victim's brother.

26:03.736 --> 26:04.954
Peter Reynolds.
Just flew in.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.565
The only family
the commander had.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.697
Know anything?
About the
commander's time

26:08.741 --> 26:09.916
aboard the
Colonial?No.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.571
About a long-term
relationship; plenty.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.268
Girlfriend
never came up.

26:14.311 --> 26:15.486
Probably because
she was married.

26:15.530 --> 26:16.966
You got a name?

26:17.010 --> 26:18.141
Peter only knew
her by "Nancy."

26:19.795 --> 26:22.842
McGee, I need to talk to
Admiral Hargrove's wife.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.583
Find her.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.635
I can't right now.
I'm swamped, okay?

26:33.679 --> 26:34.897
I love my job.
I love my Gibbs.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.246
I need more sleep and...

26:36.290 --> 26:38.422
I am learning to not be
so hard on myself.

26:38.466 --> 26:39.598
See how much time we just saved?

26:39.641 --> 26:40.860
Well, I know
for a fact

26:40.903 --> 26:41.904
that you can, uh,
work and talk

26:41.948 --> 26:43.079
at the same time.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.125
You are a champion multitasker.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.129
Okay...

26:49.172 --> 26:50.478
I'm scared.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.306
Of what?

26:52.349 --> 26:55.788
Well... what if I... tell you
a bunch of stuff, and then

26:55.831 --> 26:58.225
I learn things about myself
that I totally hate?

26:58.268 --> 27:00.662
That could happen,
but... unlikely.

27:00.706 --> 27:03.665
Okay then, go ahead.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.536
Criticize me.
I'm ready.

27:05.580 --> 27:08.452
I have nothing to criticize.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.541
Y-you are so totally grounded
in self-confidence.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.108
You make Goth look...

27:12.152 --> 27:13.283
gorgeous and fun.

27:13.327 --> 27:14.589
I'm not a Goth.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.679
I'm a... scientist.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.725
And a great one.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.509
But you work too hard.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.729
Is there any Abby time?

27:23.772 --> 27:26.470
I make sandwiches
for the shelter,
on Sundays.

27:26.514 --> 27:27.515
That's not relaxing.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.648
I... drive
for the food bank.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.780
All work and no play.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.217
Do you ever hang out with any
of your female co-workers?

27:36.698 --> 27:37.873
Hey! I heard you're
going to Norfolk.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.048
It shouldn't be
a problem.

27:39.092 --> 27:40.746
We should still be able
to leave by 6:00.

27:40.789 --> 27:41.964
Leave?

27:43.226 --> 27:44.184
For where?

27:45.402 --> 27:47.317
You two

27:47.361 --> 27:49.668
are spending
the weekend together.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.017
[sultry growl]

27:51.060 --> 27:52.627
Hold on, let me paint a picture.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.760
You're a pig.

27:56.936 --> 27:59.242
I miss Kate.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.943
If you-if you didn't,
I'd be concerned.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.988
You need someone
to fill that void.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.250
Well, it's not
like I have

28:07.294 --> 28:08.599
a lot of time
to look.

28:08.643 --> 28:10.427
Mmm... certainly
not Gibbs.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.560
And Ziva,
she's seeing somebody.

28:12.603 --> 28:13.648
How about McGee?

28:13.692 --> 28:14.954
No. No!

28:14.997 --> 28:17.391
Why not?
N-no. Because.

28:17.434 --> 28:20.046
McGee... and I, we're...

28:20.089 --> 28:22.483
We had... we're... friends.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.267
McGEE:
He stay at your place?

28:24.311 --> 28:26.617
Yep.
You sleep
in the coffin, McGee?

28:26.661 --> 28:28.663
Coffin?
Y-you said that

28:28.707 --> 28:30.056
it was-it was a boxed sofa bed.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.448
It is!

28:31.492 --> 28:33.450
Sort of.
Ugh!

28:33.494 --> 28:35.235
I can't believe I
slept in a coffin!

28:35.278 --> 28:37.585
N-not just slept.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.284
Look, um, this has been

28:41.328 --> 28:43.330
really great and all, and

28:43.373 --> 28:45.158
you're not half as creepy
as I thought you would be,

28:45.201 --> 28:47.073
but this place,
and my job, it means

28:47.116 --> 28:48.378
everything to me,
and I'd really like

28:48.422 --> 28:49.989
to get back to it, please.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.207
Work.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.431
Tape adhesive.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.305
Nancy Hargrove.

29:02.349 --> 29:04.960
Agent Gibbs.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.184
You know why
I called you?

29:14.187 --> 29:18.495
My husband told me
what happened to Vincent.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.715
They were close,
you know?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.718
Oh... I think the
two of you were...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.459
a lot closer
than that, ma'am.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.768
I'm sorry?

29:32.205 --> 29:34.990
He's dead. It's okay.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.342
[sniffles]

29:39.386 --> 29:41.823
Vincent and I
saw each other

29:41.867 --> 29:44.695
for over 20 years.

29:44.739 --> 29:48.047
He knew it could never
be more than that.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.352
The admiral
didn't know?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.660
If he did,
he never said anything.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.882
We only got together
when my husband was away.

29:59.406 --> 30:02.539
Commander Reynolds
had to retire
from the Navy.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.672
He didn't have kids;
he didn't have a wife.

30:04.715 --> 30:07.675
You take the Navy
away from him,

30:07.718 --> 30:08.850
he didn't have anything
to look forward to;

30:08.894 --> 30:11.200
not even you.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.423
What are you suggesting,
Agent Gibbs?

30:22.908 --> 30:25.040
I'm sorry for your loss.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.656
[cries quietly]

30:32.700 --> 30:34.180
CRANSTON:
Director...

30:34.223 --> 30:35.355
do you have a moment?

30:35.398 --> 30:37.487
VANCE:
How's it going?

30:37.531 --> 30:39.272
Well... I'm learning

30:39.315 --> 30:40.708
more about your team
than I thought I would.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.492
Well, I don't know
if that's a good thing.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.755
I've never met
a group of agents

30:44.799 --> 30:45.974
so connected
to their work.

30:46.018 --> 30:48.063
Yeah, for better
or for worse.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.326
That feeling translate
up the ladder?

30:55.984 --> 30:57.725
You've had
a rough run.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.901
Been through severe
trauma recently.

30:59.945 --> 31:02.121
Have you spoken to anyone
about what just happened?

31:02.164 --> 31:04.297
I don't think I like
where this is headed.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.038
This is not about me,
it's about them.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.301
You're team director.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.522
Do you know what I've
had to sacrifice for this job?

31:12.566 --> 31:13.654
For the Navy?

31:15.047 --> 31:16.831
Comes with the situation.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.920
What do you know
about my situation?

31:18.964 --> 31:22.097
VANCE: Since I got hurt,
we've been on SECNAV's radar.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.490
When the vacancy
was created

31:23.533 --> 31:25.535
at the top
of your agency,

31:25.579 --> 31:28.190
you induced me
to give you this post.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.018
And the deal
was quite simple:

31:30.062 --> 31:33.108
get your house in order.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.936
VANCE: And I want to prove
that recent events

31:34.980 --> 31:37.112
haven't influenced
things around here.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.897
My life is a lie.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.724
You were never
supposed to succeed.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.946
I think the recent attempt
on your life

31:44.990 --> 31:46.426
absolutely terrified you,

31:46.469 --> 31:48.471
and now you're
questioning yourself.

31:48.515 --> 31:51.257
If you let your guard down
for one minute,

31:51.300 --> 31:53.085
what are you
worried about losing?

31:53.128 --> 31:58.960
[phone ringing]

31:59.004 --> 32:00.614
Yeah. It's Vance.

32:00.657 --> 32:01.441
Go, Gibbs.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.487
Are you sure?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.143
I need these
crew members

32:08.187 --> 32:09.666
assembled in your
mess hall, Captain.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.016
TONY: Breaking
rule number one, boss.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.843
Yeah. Again.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.628
CAPTAIN LIND: They worked
closely with Commander Reynolds.

32:14.671 --> 32:15.934
TONY:
That's why we need them, sir.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.501
They know who killed your XO.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.424
GIBBS:
What was your relationship
with Commander Reynolds?

32:28.468 --> 32:30.470
He was a
respected officer.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.385
Great XO.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.953
Father figure.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.824
Was he hard on you?

32:36.867 --> 32:40.654
He made us better sailors.

32:40.697 --> 32:41.785
Commander Reynolds' father

32:41.829 --> 32:43.874
was in World War II
and in Korea.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.702
Did you know that?
HOWARD:
No, sir.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.663
This is the weapon
he carried.

32:49.706 --> 32:52.448
It was given to him
by a Russian officer.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.450
XO had it with
him on board.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.409
And, as you know,
that's a big no-no

32:56.452 --> 32:59.412
aboard a Navy vessel.

32:59.455 --> 33:00.500
Does it look familiar?

33:03.111 --> 33:06.158
We found tape residue
on the commander.

33:06.201 --> 33:08.638
The only DNA on it
was his own.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.989
TONY: So we were thinking,
well, what if he

33:11.032 --> 33:13.034
taped the gun to his hand

33:13.078 --> 33:15.602
so it wouldn't move,
no matter what.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.865
Commander Reynolds

33:17.908 --> 33:19.301
was nine months away
from mandatory retirement

33:19.345 --> 33:20.694
in the Navy.

33:20.737 --> 33:21.651
He didn't have a family.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.827
His career was over.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.917
So your XO...

33:26.961 --> 33:28.789
was about to lose
everything he cared about.

33:31.618 --> 33:32.836
You discovered the body, Ensign?

33:32.880 --> 33:35.056
Yes.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.840
You didn't want
him remembered
as a weak man,

33:36.884 --> 33:38.842
so with the
petty officer's help

33:38.886 --> 33:40.366
you made it look like a murder?

33:43.630 --> 33:46.067
The gun was still attached to
his hand when I walked in.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.938
Didn't seem right.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.853
We knocked some things
onto the floor

33:49.897 --> 33:51.333
around the bunk.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.205
Made it look
like a scuffle.

33:53.248 --> 33:56.164
Didn't see
the bullet casing.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.907
He was a man of honor;

33:59.950 --> 34:02.083
he deserved to be
buried like one.

34:26.673 --> 34:30.068
What do you see when you
look at him, Agent DiNozzo?

34:31.852 --> 34:34.289
Man works his whole life,

34:34.333 --> 34:37.118
dedicates himself to his job,

34:37.162 --> 34:39.860
and then has nothing
to show for it.

34:41.035 --> 34:43.255
How does that make you feel?

34:47.563 --> 34:50.262
Afraid.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.787
I'm a good agent,
Dr. Cranston.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.832
A really good one.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.183
I-I know.

34:58.226 --> 35:01.055
And so do a lot of
other people.

35:03.101 --> 35:03.797
You're not authorized
to give out my phone--

35:03.840 --> 35:05.059
Agent Todd...

35:05.103 --> 35:06.887
you are interrupting
my negotiation.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.716
Well it's kind of
beautiful up here.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.413
And dangerous.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.111
Well, from this height,
you can't really tell.

35:13.154 --> 35:16.070
I was referring
to you.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.289
I thought you were
going to attack me

35:17.332 --> 35:19.029
back in Iggy's stall.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.510
How was I
supposed to know

35:21.554 --> 35:23.599
what you were
planning?
Well, we're
a team, Kate.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.688
You're supposed to
follow my lead.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.168
Oh, even when I don't
know where it's going?

35:27.212 --> 35:28.778
Especially then.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.958
But you can be more.

35:35.002 --> 35:36.221
Has anyone ever
told you that?

35:37.918 --> 35:39.789
You're afraid, aren't you?

35:39.833 --> 35:41.400
You ever seen me afraid?

35:41.443 --> 35:43.924
Well, not when the danger is
something that we can confront.

35:43.967 --> 35:46.709
Why aren't you sick?

35:46.753 --> 35:48.581
'Cause I'm stronger
than you, Tony.

35:48.624 --> 35:50.191
[groans]
You're not... [coughs]

35:50.235 --> 35:51.192
Am too.

35:56.284 --> 35:58.591
Maybe Agent Todd
was hard on you

35:58.634 --> 36:00.462
because she knew what
you were really capable of.

36:04.249 --> 36:07.339
Too bad she never got a chance
to tell you that.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.650
I think I just
realized who you are...

36:14.694 --> 36:16.652
Rachel.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.695
So how'd we do?

36:59.739 --> 37:02.002
I can't tell.

37:02.045 --> 37:04.178
Doctor-patient privilege.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.049
Aw, come on, Doc. It's me.

37:07.312 --> 37:10.271
Still one agent
I haven't spoken to yet.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.665
Well, that's not
going to happen.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.928
I forgot.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.669
You're perfect.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.192
No, no, I'm just

37:18.236 --> 37:20.542
too set in my ways
to change now.

37:20.586 --> 37:23.284
You know when you were
lying there a second ago...

37:23.328 --> 37:26.156
you looked just like your
sister, you know that?

37:28.637 --> 37:31.858
I heard you
quit, Agent Todd!

37:31.901 --> 37:34.600
Happy news gets around fast.

37:34.643 --> 37:35.818
Yes, I resigned.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.429
It was the right thing
to do.
Yep.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.996
Pull that crap at NCIS,

37:40.040 --> 37:42.695
I won't give you a chance
to resign.

37:42.738 --> 37:46.264
Is that a job offer?

37:48.091 --> 37:49.615
[groans]Protection detail's
over, Kate.

37:49.658 --> 37:50.616
[groans]

37:50.659 --> 37:53.227
You did good.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.838
For once,
DiNozzo's right.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.101
[laughs]
Wow...

37:58.145 --> 38:00.147
I thought I'd die before
I ever heard a compli--

38:05.152 --> 38:07.720
I'm glad you reached out.

38:07.763 --> 38:10.897
Did you find what
you were looking for?

38:13.203 --> 38:15.423
Finally...

38:15.467 --> 38:18.208
got to meet the people
closest to Kate

38:18.252 --> 38:20.559
when she died.

38:20.602 --> 38:23.649
Closure.

38:23.692 --> 38:26.565
Some.

38:26.608 --> 38:27.957
Some.

38:31.874 --> 38:34.834
[voice breaks]:
You've been better
at letting go than I have.

38:34.877 --> 38:38.577
You don't forget,
you just move on.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.974
Come on,
I want to show you something.

38:45.018 --> 38:46.062
Where are we going?

38:46.106 --> 38:47.412
Home.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.767
Stand right here.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.029
Right there.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.031
Look down.
You feel that?

38:58.074 --> 38:59.032
Right there?

38:59.075 --> 39:00.381
What?

39:00.425 --> 39:01.556
This is where

39:01.600 --> 39:04.254
the guy who
murdered Kate died.

39:07.475 --> 39:09.999
This is where Ziva
shot her own brother.

39:10.043 --> 39:14.700
That, Doc, is closure.

39:26.712 --> 39:28.975
Now, the rest
is just memories.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.543
There's nothing wrong
with memories.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.285
RACHEL:
Kate, sweetie,

39:35.329 --> 39:37.200
listen to me--
I got your message.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.201
KATE [over phone]:
I can't work with Gibbs.

39:38.245 --> 39:39.202
He doesn't appreciate anything.

39:39.246 --> 39:40.639
Uh... of course
he appreciates

39:40.682 --> 39:42.031
what you're doing,
or he wouldn't have

39:42.075 --> 39:43.293
asked you to come work there.

39:43.337 --> 39:45.208
Uh... so what
if he gives you a hard time?

39:45.252 --> 39:47.863
Don't let Gibbs get to you.

39:47.907 --> 39:48.821
You are damn good at your job,

39:48.864 --> 39:50.213
and you know it.

39:50.257 --> 39:51.519
KATE:
I do know, sis.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.216
It's just...
I'm just having a bad day.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.218
Thanks, Rachel.
I love you.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.524
I love you, too, baby sister.

39:56.568 --> 39:57.525
Let's talk soon.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.526
Okay.

39:58.570 --> 39:59.397
Bye.Bye.

40:02.791 --> 40:04.445
Hm.

40:06.273 --> 40:08.318
Never went to the funeral.

40:09.537 --> 40:10.712
Just couldn't do it.

40:19.504 --> 40:23.464
Families all grieve
in different ways.

40:25.945 --> 40:27.990
Let me ask you
a question, Gibbs.

40:28.034 --> 40:30.602
See if you can answer.

40:30.645 --> 40:31.603
Man walks into a bar,

40:33.561 --> 40:35.563
asks the bartender
for a glass of water.

40:35.607 --> 40:38.479
Bartender pulls out a shotgun,

40:38.523 --> 40:40.263
fires a blast,
just missing the man.

40:41.395 --> 40:42.483
Man says "Thank you,"

40:42.527 --> 40:44.006
puts a tip on the bar,
and exits.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.227
Why the "thank you"...

40:47.270 --> 40:49.098
and the tip?

40:53.581 --> 40:55.453
The guy had the hiccups.

40:58.673 --> 41:01.589
It's all about
responses, Gibbs.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.899
You, Vance...

41:06.942 --> 41:09.554
your agents.

41:09.597 --> 41:13.340
We keep things
piled up inside...

41:14.559 --> 41:17.605
even the harshest response
seems appropriate.

41:29.574 --> 41:32.359
CRANSTON:
Director Vance,

41:32.402 --> 41:33.665
spending time with your team

41:33.708 --> 41:36.363
has been enlightening,
to say the least.

41:36.406 --> 41:39.279
In clinical terms,
they're a disaster.

41:39.322 --> 41:41.411
But their selfless dysfunction

41:41.455 --> 41:44.023
is ultimately why it works.

41:44.066 --> 41:45.285
It's clear to me

41:45.328 --> 41:46.678
we all react
to life's challenges

41:46.721 --> 41:48.375
in different ways.

41:48.418 --> 41:50.029
Your people are no exception.

41:50.072 --> 41:53.511
Some fight death,

41:53.554 --> 41:58.167
and some embrace its solace.

41:58.211 --> 42:02.345
Some recognize their fate...

42:02.389 --> 42:07.002
and others do whatever
is necessary to alter it.

42:07.046 --> 42:11.311
Sometimes we defy
others' expectations,

42:11.354 --> 42:14.575
and, occasionally,
we rise to meet them.

42:14.619 --> 42:18.971
But the constant,
is being true to ourselves.

42:19.014 --> 42:21.887
We do what we have to,
when we have to.

42:21.930 --> 42:24.890
We react,
for better or worse.

42:24.933 --> 42:29.547
It's why your team succeeds.

42:30.939 --> 42:32.288
But be careful.

42:32.332 --> 42:35.509
Eventually,
it might catch up to you.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.817
A man walks into a bar

42:38.860 --> 42:41.210
and asks the bartender
for a glass of water.

42:41.254 --> 42:44.431
The bartender pulls out
a shotgun...
