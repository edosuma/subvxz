01:04.242 --> 01:06.123
Are you looking for this?

01:17.793 --> 01:22.093
No, I was just passing by
and decided to check this place out.

01:23.033 --> 01:24.902
What are you doing here, Mr. President?

01:24.903 --> 01:27.842
I came by
because I was reminiscing about the past.

01:27.843 --> 01:31.212
You must have a special memory from 1983.

01:31.213 --> 01:34.133
I had a couple of promising hoobaes*
back then. (*more junior colleagues)

01:35.453 --> 01:37.412
The cafeteria food here must not be good.

01:37.413 --> 01:39.582
You've become skinnier
than when I first saw you.

01:39.583 --> 01:40.942
Eat well.

01:40.943 --> 01:44.142
You're responsible for the
National Communications Network Team.

01:44.143 --> 01:45.833
Responsible?

01:46.033 --> 01:47.542
Oh, no.

01:47.543 --> 01:49.382
I'm just learning while working there.

01:49.383 --> 01:52.233
Can I steal some of your time, Dr. Lee?

01:52.393 --> 01:54.042
Dr. Lee, come here for a second.

01:54.043 --> 01:58.073
This is a blog that I made...

01:59.043 --> 01:59.782
I'm sorry.

01:59.783 --> 02:01.262
It's okay, it's okay.

02:01.263 --> 02:03.393
There are a lot of things here, huh?

02:04.063 --> 02:07.603
I have to learn how to use the computer
as soon as I can and read all this.

02:08.203 --> 02:09.162
All this?

02:09.163 --> 02:13.222
Yes, I don't want to be a President
who just stamps documents.

02:13.223 --> 02:15.713
I need to stay current
in order to keep the assemblymen in line,

02:15.783 --> 02:17.662
and get the officials to cooperate.

02:17.663 --> 02:20.062
You have your aides,
you should ask for their help.

02:20.063 --> 02:22.012
No, they're busy too.

02:22.013 --> 02:25.553
And since I receive more pay,
I should of course be doing more work.

02:25.583 --> 02:30.323
Look at this. I can't upload this picture.
How do you upload?

02:30.363 --> 02:31.733
All right.

02:32.353 --> 02:38.112
First, you decide where you want to put
the picture and then check the source.

02:38.353 --> 02:39.562
Do you want to try it?

02:39.563 --> 02:41.092
Oh, oh, hold on.

02:41.093 --> 02:45.962
You just click this here, right?

02:45.963 --> 02:48.363
You learn pretty fast.

02:48.843 --> 02:51.770
If Da Hye had one quarter
of your intelligence,

02:51.771 --> 02:54.232
she would have done well in her studies.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.662
What can you do?
Each person has his or her own talents.

02:57.663 --> 03:02.383
Look at my blog tonight, I'm going to upload
some of my son's pictures.

03:03.893 --> 03:07.722
Do you know the website ChoiDaHye.com*?
(*Da Hye's anti-cafe site)

03:07.723 --> 03:09.402
Yes, I do.

03:09.403 --> 03:14.342
Because her father is the president,
she has an anti-cafe and was even egged.

03:14.343 --> 03:18.053
Lately, I can't even bear to face her.

03:18.723 --> 03:21.842
My wife and I want to go see her
at the place she works part-time,

03:21.843 --> 03:24.002
but even that is difficult to do.

03:24.003 --> 03:25.672
I wonder if she's doing well.

03:25.673 --> 03:29.762
If she's not saying she's going to quit,
she's probably doing well.

03:29.763 --> 03:32.222
I'll stop by sometime
to grab a cup of coffee.

03:32.223 --> 03:35.383
Will you?
Then I'm very grateful.

03:35.503 --> 03:38.812
Oh, and this afternoon
please come to the reception hall.

03:38.813 --> 03:42.343
There's a meeting of economic leaders,
you should come too.

03:42.463 --> 03:44.842
I don't think it's a meeting
that I can attend.

03:44.843 --> 03:49.042
Why not? You're the president's
computer teacher, of course you can attend.

03:49.043 --> 03:50.607
Come and have a look.

03:50.608 --> 03:55.230
You can see
what the economic leaders of Korea are like.

04:03.683 --> 04:05.932
Ahjumma, it's me.

04:05.933 --> 04:09.232
Why did you send this kind of a present
when you're sick?

04:09.233 --> 04:11.370
You haven't come to the hospital
for a while.

04:11.371 --> 04:13.272
Are you planning not to come again?

04:13.753 --> 04:14.982
I will.

04:14.983 --> 04:18.692
I embroidered that because I was bored.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.531
Even if you boil the handkerchief,

04:20.533 --> 04:23.493
the color won't fade and you won't
get it mixed up with other people's.

04:23.883 --> 04:25.152
It's pretty.

04:25.153 --> 04:27.782
I know being an agent is hard.

04:27.783 --> 04:33.712
Eat well, rest well, play well,
and work hard.

04:33.713 --> 04:35.203
Yes.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.332
What are you doing?

04:36.333 --> 04:38.592
The Economic Leaders' Luncheon
is about to start, so go get ready.

04:38.593 --> 04:40.003
Yes.

04:40.173 --> 04:42.642
Mr. Lee, your face doesn't look well.

04:42.643 --> 04:45.133
Is there something troubling you?

04:45.573 --> 04:47.502
What troubles?

04:47.503 --> 04:51.972
There was nothing more than a petty thief
who came by last night while I was out.

04:51.973 --> 04:56.462
Oh, my. I'll introduce you
to a good security company.

04:56.463 --> 05:00.102
But, the thief, did you catch him?

05:00.103 --> 05:03.192
Yes, I'll catch him soon.

05:03.193 --> 05:05.922
The thing he took is very important.

05:05.923 --> 05:11.643
I don't know what it is,
but I really hope you find it soon.

05:12.113 --> 05:13.623
By the way,

05:14.113 --> 05:20.102
the special ops team you asked about
last time, I actually kind of lied.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.462
Lied?

05:21.463 --> 05:25.542
It's a lie they were killed betraying the
country by stealing national intelligence.

05:25.543 --> 05:29.842
Those men actually died while carrying out
a mission for the country.

05:29.843 --> 05:32.302
Why are you telling me this?

05:32.303 --> 05:37.203
We've gotten on the same boat,
so what is there to hide?

05:37.453 --> 05:41.712
The truth is, the City Hunter seems to be
obsessed with investigating that case,

05:41.713 --> 05:45.022
and I wanted to aggravate him, so I lied.
What I said was a lie.

05:45.023 --> 05:49.312
The fact is,
if he wants to discover the truth,

05:49.313 --> 05:52.022
then he'll need to find the secret records
from back then.

05:52.023 --> 05:55.863
But I have the only copy of those records.

05:56.853 --> 05:59.392
He'll come here to get it.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.902
But do you think I'll just hand it over?

06:01.903 --> 06:06.803
I hid it in a really deep place.

06:09.783 --> 06:14.432
I don't have interest in those kinds
of stories. My only interest is money.

06:14.433 --> 06:17.172
I live for the fun of multiplying my money.

06:17.173 --> 06:20.336
By the way, in order to lobby
for the privatization of healthcare,

06:20.379 --> 06:22.363
I spent large sums of money
bribing officials.

06:22.364 --> 06:25.042
Thank you so much
for your promise of additional funds.

06:25.043 --> 06:28.003
It's hard to lobby
with insufficient ammunition.

06:28.033 --> 06:30.650
You just have to continue
as you're doing now,

06:30.685 --> 06:33.946
and show me how my money is being used.

06:33.983 --> 06:37.232
Since you fulfilled my request
to become Haewon Construction's president,

06:37.233 --> 06:41.123
it's only right that I take care of these
background issues for you in return.

06:42.053 --> 06:47.792
By the way, you didn't forget
the Blue House luncheon today, did you?

06:47.793 --> 06:52.333
I'll introduce you to the president.

06:52.903 --> 06:58.863
It's about time you meet the president,
Mr. Lee.

07:01.263 --> 07:04.272
Then, I'll see you at the luncheon.

07:04.273 --> 07:05.683
Yes.

07:22.063 --> 07:28.063
You gave the CEO seat to Steve Lee,
what are you planning?

07:28.083 --> 07:31.193
He's just there for show, I don't care.

07:31.883 --> 07:34.262
He already invested 300 billion,

07:34.263 --> 07:36.592
all I have to do
is take the remaining 200 billion.

07:36.593 --> 07:38.412
And after that,

07:38.979 --> 07:43.505
I'll get rid of Steve Lee
without leaving a trace.

07:43.943 --> 07:45.643
Yes, Sir.

07:58.843 --> 08:00.653
Did you finish checking everything?

08:01.583 --> 08:03.632
Yes, we're almost finished
with everything in this room.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.852
There can't be any mistakes.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.882
I'll be on standby at the office, so just
call me right away if something happens.

08:08.883 --> 08:11.013
Yes, I understand.

08:19.013 --> 08:20.802
Let's go, let's go.

08:20.803 --> 08:24.632
There's a luncheon meeting today and
they'll have lots of delicious food there.

08:24.633 --> 08:27.403
Hey Kid, let go and talk.

08:27.404 --> 08:31.604
1, 2, 3...

08:32.033 --> 08:36.082
You have to eat lunch anyway,
so stop being so snooty.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.533
Where did you say
today's luncheon is being held?

08:55.043 --> 08:56.182
- President.
- Nice to meet you.

08:56.183 --> 08:57.903
Nice to meet you.

08:58.123 --> 08:59.102
You've been well?

08:59.103 --> 09:00.423
Yes.

09:00.523 --> 09:02.343
Chairman Chun.

09:07.983 --> 09:12.913
Nice to meet you, President Choi Eung Chan.

09:24.423 --> 09:26.233
Yes.

09:52.043 --> 09:56.651
Leaders, for your tireless effort
towards driving this nation's economy,

09:56.652 --> 09:59.588
I am unable to properly express
my gratitude, in any other way,

09:59.589 --> 10:02.811
so I've organized this luncheon for you,

10:02.812 --> 10:06.589
in the hopes
you will continue to put forth your best.

10:06.743 --> 10:10.482
Our nation's innovative ideas and technology
are some of the best in the world,

10:10.517 --> 10:14.196
and our potential for growth
and improvement,

10:14.197 --> 10:17.508
is a source of surprise and envy
for the rest of the world.

10:17.593 --> 10:19.228
I hope that you all
will continue to hone your skills,

10:19.229 --> 10:22.618
and further contribute
to our nation's worldwide reputation.

10:22.983 --> 10:24.886
As you enjoy your meal today,

10:24.887 --> 10:26.396
please also inform me

10:26.397 --> 10:30.986
of any obstacles you've encountered
related to economics and business.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.871
I will do my best to listen to your concerns
and help resolve them.

10:35.403 --> 10:37.073
Thank you.

10:51.993 --> 10:54.112
Teacher, you like meat, right?

10:54.113 --> 10:56.223
Eat a lot of meat.

10:59.383 --> 11:01.772
What are you doing here with Da Hye
and drawing attention to yourself?

11:01.773 --> 11:03.812
The president told me to come.

11:03.813 --> 11:05.183
Did he?

11:11.083 --> 11:12.882
Please enjoy your meal.

11:12.883 --> 11:15.693
It's a simple meal, but eat a lot.

11:46.403 --> 11:48.183
Dad!

12:02.913 --> 12:07.253
Hold on.
I'm fine, so calm down.

12:24.573 --> 12:26.213
Are you all right?

12:26.253 --> 12:27.802
Yes, I'm fine.

12:27.803 --> 12:29.282
Are you okay, Mr. President?

12:29.283 --> 12:31.023
I'm fine too.

12:38.753 --> 12:41.312
What the...?
It's paint.

12:41.313 --> 12:43.233
Who did...?

12:46.363 --> 12:48.052
Wipe it with this.

12:48.053 --> 12:49.783
Thanks.

12:54.903 --> 12:56.752
We should move.

12:56.753 --> 12:57.932
Take the president outside.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.243
Okay.
This way, please.

13:04.003 --> 13:06.532
This is the end of today's luncheon.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.311
To all those in attendance today,

13:08.312 --> 13:10.807
we'll be searching each individual
and your belongings.

13:10.808 --> 13:12.624
We ask for your cooperation.

13:16.473 --> 13:21.912
It seems someone has gone too far
with this prank on the president.

13:21.913 --> 13:23.912
It seems so.

13:23.913 --> 13:27.133
The president appears to be really shocked.

13:37.853 --> 13:39.383
Father.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.302
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

13:47.303 --> 13:48.922
Kim Na Na is pretty good.

13:48.923 --> 13:51.052
This is the Blue House.

13:51.053 --> 13:54.633
By needlessly putting Na Na in danger,
you could have died.

13:55.923 --> 13:57.832
Are you worried about me?

13:57.833 --> 14:02.753
No, I came
because I'm sick of your stupid ways.

14:03.563 --> 14:06.453
Since you saw the secret records
you must know.

14:07.293 --> 14:10.122
Who is the fifth?

14:10.123 --> 14:15.353
There's an order to our revenge.
We haven't even caught Chun Jae Man.

14:29.543 --> 14:31.263
We found it.

14:42.763 --> 14:44.553
It was here?

14:49.133 --> 14:52.693
I'm sorry about the incident today.

14:53.293 --> 14:57.552
We investigated it
and it seems to be an inside job...

14:57.553 --> 15:01.263
or someone who knows the Blue House
really well.

15:01.343 --> 15:02.482
Really.

15:02.483 --> 15:06.783
He knew about places and things
that no outsiders should know.

15:06.963 --> 15:11.203
An incident like this is the biggest mistake
a security agent can make.

15:11.503 --> 15:14.182
I'll take responsibility
for today's events and...

15:14.183 --> 15:16.453
You're going to quit?

15:16.473 --> 15:18.652
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

15:18.653 --> 15:20.152
Mr. President.

15:20.153 --> 15:25.492
Everyone thinks they can take care of things
by quitting, but I don't agree with that.

15:25.493 --> 15:27.140
Instead, you should be more cautious

15:27.141 --> 15:30.591
and take measures
to ensure this doesn't happen again.

15:30.593 --> 15:32.712
This is a crime.

15:32.713 --> 15:34.842
I'll do my utmost to track down the culprit.

15:34.843 --> 15:37.822
Of course you will.
You may leave.

15:37.823 --> 15:41.443
Oh Agent Kim Na Na, a word with you please.

15:53.023 --> 15:56.313
I'm curious about this handkerchief.

15:56.643 --> 16:00.073
This pattern, did you embroider it yourself?

16:00.313 --> 16:03.662
No, I received it as a present
from someone I know.

16:03.663 --> 16:08.152
Someone you know...
May I ask who?

16:08.153 --> 16:11.963
May I ask why you're asking this?

16:12.693 --> 16:15.613
I was wondering if it is someone I know.

16:17.293 --> 16:22.283
You probably don't,
she's just a regular woman.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.483
I see.

16:27.263 --> 16:28.922
Work hard.

16:28.923 --> 16:30.303
Yes.

17:08.923 --> 17:10.551
Ahjumma, it's me.

17:10.553 --> 17:12.682
Did you eat lunch?

17:12.683 --> 17:15.092
Did I pressure you too much
with the handkerchief present?

17:15.093 --> 17:17.301
You called me twice today.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.002
You don't have to do that.

17:19.002 --> 17:23.342
I just sent it because I missed you, Na Na.

17:23.343 --> 17:29.303
Ahjumma, the handkerchief you gave me...

17:29.803 --> 17:35.322
The president saw it
and asked who gave it to me.

17:35.323 --> 17:40.413
<i>I was wondering if I could tell him
you made it for me.</i>

17:41.853 --> 17:45.653
No... no, don't tell him.

17:46.123 --> 17:47.142
What?

17:47.143 --> 17:52.552
He wouldn't be curious about someone
like me, he probably just asked to be nice.

17:52.553 --> 17:55.383
Don't tell him.
Okay?

17:55.423 --> 17:57.763
Okay, I won't.

17:59.043 --> 18:02.482
I heard that staying in an isolation room
long-term will weaken your body.

18:02.483 --> 18:04.382
If you have time,
go out and get some exercise.

18:04.383 --> 18:10.153
Yes, I was just about to go exercise.

18:10.983 --> 18:13.883
Okay, I'm going.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.013
No...

18:24.123 --> 18:26.623
He didn't ask for any particular reason.

18:28.243 --> 18:30.553
He didn't ask for any particular reason.

18:48.063 --> 18:51.043
All of those things, take care of it.

19:16.273 --> 19:19.982
That child shouldn't be born
into this world.

19:20.283 --> 19:21.677
Abort it.

19:22.633 --> 19:25.402
It's my child, I'll raise him myself.

19:25.403 --> 19:31.373
A woman who works in a bar is going to ruin
Choi Eun Chan's limitless future?

19:31.593 --> 19:34.362
Choi Eun Chan is about to abandon
his family for you right now!

19:34.363 --> 19:36.933
Eun Chan doesn't know.

19:37.193 --> 19:39.182
Please keep the secret.

19:39.183 --> 19:41.413
He's my friend that can't be replaced.

19:42.233 --> 19:46.143
I can't watch him be destroyed
because of you.

19:55.393 --> 19:57.663
Abort the child and disappear.

19:59.293 --> 20:01.562
That's the best thing you can do
for Eun Chan.

20:01.563 --> 20:05.873
And never appear in front of me again.

20:06.523 --> 20:08.893
I won't be able to guarantee your life.

20:22.703 --> 20:27.173
Meeting him again like this... no.

20:27.273 --> 20:30.763
No, no...

20:32.333 --> 20:38.333
Moo Yul, you saved Kyung Hee
and the life inside her...

20:40.103 --> 20:43.153
and you saved the current Yoon Sung.

20:44.563 --> 20:48.413
Even though he wasn't your child,
you said you'd raise him well...

20:49.673 --> 20:53.343
but can you understand
the actions I'm taking now?

20:54.573 --> 20:57.813
Even if you don't,

20:58.313 --> 21:02.063
I can't stop this revenge.

21:09.743 --> 21:13.703
Oh, I startled you.

21:15.863 --> 21:19.813
Hello, I'm Bae Shik Joong.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.653
I live with Yoon Sung...

21:22.863 --> 21:25.203
Oh, yes.

21:26.373 --> 21:29.562
He said
you're doing a lot for him these days.

21:29.563 --> 21:33.023
No, I'm not,
we're just helping each other out.

21:34.323 --> 21:37.483
Yoon Sung told me to give this to you,
so I came.

21:49.223 --> 21:52.863
Yoon Sung misses him a lot too,
whenever he looks at that photo.

21:53.373 --> 21:56.193
It would have been nice
if he were still alive.

21:57.176 --> 21:59.822
Then please take care of yourself.
I'll be leaving now.

21:59.823 --> 22:01.743
Wait...

22:10.693 --> 22:16.192
Give this to Yoon Sung,
tell him I embroidered it myself.

22:16.193 --> 22:20.102
Yes, wow. Yoon Sung is going to love it.

22:20.103 --> 22:22.523
I'll definitely get it to him.

22:37.043 --> 22:38.553
Chief.

22:38.943 --> 22:41.002
There was an accident
at the reception hall, did you hear?

22:41.003 --> 22:44.122
That's a seriously delayed reaction
from you.

22:44.123 --> 22:47.843
Luckily, the president was okay
and no one got hurt.

22:47.913 --> 22:53.142
I nearly had a heart attack!
I don't think I can have an agent as a wife.

22:53.143 --> 22:55.252
How I can live normally
when I'm constantly worried about her?

22:55.253 --> 22:56.462
An agent wife?

22:56.463 --> 22:59.602
Go Ki Joon, do you like an agent?

22:59.603 --> 23:00.943
Huh?

23:01.063 --> 23:04.642
Yes... No, no.
What I meant was...

23:04.643 --> 23:08.972
I was thinking
an agent's job is very dangerous.

23:08.973 --> 23:11.372
Of course.
It's not something anyone can do.

23:11.373 --> 23:13.972
You put your life on the line.

23:13.973 --> 23:17.482
Chief Park Ho Shik
isn't single for no reason.

23:17.483 --> 23:20.683
I'm going to the infirmary,
my head hurts.

23:58.573 --> 24:02.193
<i>How long are you going to keep holding onto
memories of people no longer by your side?</i>

24:02.293 --> 24:05.293
Ending up having feelings for
or liking someone...

24:06.963 --> 24:09.973
I've never once imagined that.

24:10.503 --> 24:12.327
That's why...

24:12.328 --> 24:14.217
You let go of me first.

24:49.573 --> 24:55.293
Lee Kyung Wan,
Seo Yong Hak, Kim Jong Shik...

24:56.443 --> 24:59.033
No more sacrifices.

24:59.523 --> 25:02.790
Twenty eight years ago,
Operation Clean Sweep...

25:02.791 --> 25:04.974
I'll make it public.

25:05.603 --> 25:09.082
What Chairman Chun said
at the press conference was wrong.

25:09.083 --> 25:12.233
You must have suffered a major shock today.

25:12.993 --> 25:16.383
When you covered up the incident,
you did it the way you wanted,

25:16.593 --> 25:19.732
but it's not up to you,
to reveal it the way you want.

25:19.733 --> 25:20.892
Jin Pyo.

25:20.893 --> 25:24.713
They loved the motherland
more than anyone else.

25:25.243 --> 25:33.413
I hear their screams every night
and for 28 years I dreamed of revenge.

25:33.763 --> 25:36.403
I'm only one step away...

25:36.693 --> 25:41.403
but if you reveal it now,
then it will be tasteless, like flat beer.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.042
If you do that, what will you get from it?

25:44.043 --> 25:47.123
I thought about forgetting too.

25:47.653 --> 25:50.613
Yes, maybe it was for a greater cause,

25:50.614 --> 25:54.323
and you had no choice back then,
then I would try to understand.

25:55.473 --> 25:58.833
But seeing how all of you act now,

25:59.563 --> 26:03.043
I realize my men died like dogs,
for nothing.

26:03.333 --> 26:08.193
Just the way one rotten orange
will make an entire box of oranges rot...

26:08.653 --> 26:12.893
The rotten object has to be removed
to stop the process of decay.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.693
I'm going to remove it.

26:17.353 --> 26:19.603
Just wait a little.

26:19.993 --> 26:23.423
You'll soon see my gift to you.

26:27.143 --> 26:30.443
Why did you take Kyung Hee's child?

26:46.023 --> 26:50.013
The secret records I thought would be
at Lee Jin Pyo's house, weren't there.

26:50.023 --> 26:52.323
Then who could have taken it?

26:55.313 --> 26:58.602
Why did Lee Jin Pyo approach Chun Jae Man?

26:58.603 --> 27:00.523
For revenge?

27:01.363 --> 27:04.223
But he's using too much money
for such a thing.

27:08.433 --> 27:12.614
The companies under Haewon Group have
very high debt ratios (liabilities: assets).

27:13.231 --> 27:15.188
It's risky for them to continue like this.

27:15.223 --> 27:18.743
Haewon Construction
and Haewon Chemicals have the same issue.

27:19.363 --> 27:23.802
They use credit as a guarantee for more
loans to be used on another company.

27:23.803 --> 27:29.363
It's like a credit card company, you take it
from one company and invest it in another.

27:32.653 --> 27:37.453
Hold on... Haewon Construction's president
is Steve Lee?

27:38.563 --> 27:41.673
Haewon Construction's president
is Steve Lee...

27:44.233 --> 27:45.042
Chief...

27:45.043 --> 27:46.563
What are you doing?

27:49.553 --> 27:53.872
Chun Jae Man and Haewon, again...
I'm so sick of you.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.332
I told you to stay out of this case.

27:55.333 --> 27:56.692
I can't even look at it?

27:56.693 --> 27:58.122
You want me to just put in some face time
and play while getting paid?

27:58.123 --> 28:02.482
You never listen, that's why
the other department heads don't like you.

28:02.483 --> 28:03.412
Pack your things.

28:03.413 --> 28:05.202
Pack what things when I'm suspended?

28:05.203 --> 28:07.699
Suspension on top of suspension...
You've been demoted.

28:07.723 --> 28:10.052
It was decided
at the meeting of department heads just now.

28:10.053 --> 28:12.532
- To Daecheon District Prosecutor's Office.
- Chief...

28:12.533 --> 28:17.102
Prosecutor, City Hunter sent you files
but what is this...?

28:17.103 --> 28:17.892
Oh, just...

28:17.893 --> 28:19.542
Chief, what are you doing here...?

28:19.543 --> 28:21.783
Did you just say City Hunter?

28:22.003 --> 28:25.062
Investigator Kim, Prosecutor Kim Yong Joo
has been demoted, as of today...

28:25.063 --> 28:27.042
so get it to Prosecutor Ha Dong Wook.

28:27.043 --> 28:29.003
Give it to me, hurry.

28:29.063 --> 28:30.732
What do I do...?

28:30.733 --> 28:32.363
Give it here.

28:37.983 --> 28:40.979
I don't know either...
I took a look at it, just in case.

28:41.014 --> 28:42.097
The National Institute
of Environmental Research

28:42.098 --> 28:43.551
and Korea Research Institute
of Standards and Science,

28:43.553 --> 28:47.532
both investigated the chemical waste at
Haewon Chemicals and found a lot of issues.

28:47.533 --> 28:48.963
Here.

28:52.273 --> 28:56.663
There was an intruder
at Haewon Chemicals' factory last time.

28:56.773 --> 28:59.023
Investigator Jang, you too?

29:00.963 --> 29:03.113
You're all getting demoted too!

29:05.613 --> 29:08.042
There's a laborers' waiver agreement.

29:08.043 --> 29:09.923
I'm going out.

29:10.003 --> 29:13.243
Hey, Kim Young Joo, you!

29:13.723 --> 29:17.592
Teacher, I'm buying to celebrate
getting hired. So enjoy your drink.

29:17.593 --> 29:20.152
I get off work soon,
so let's go out together after.

29:20.153 --> 29:22.132
I told you I gave up coffee.

29:22.133 --> 29:25.392
But, this job seems to really suit you.

29:25.393 --> 29:27.052
I thought you'd quit after a day or two.

29:27.053 --> 29:31.293
I'm working hard
and very, very seriously too.

29:31.963 --> 29:37.092
Luckily nothing happened, but watching what
happened to my father at the luncheon...

29:37.093 --> 29:38.972
I've been thinking about it a lot.

29:38.973 --> 29:40.442
I might not do well in my studies,

29:40.443 --> 29:44.303
but I'm going to work hard for my future,
so my dad has one less thing to worry about.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.243
You're finally acting less like a child.

29:48.143 --> 29:50.592
How is Kim Na Na?
Is she okay?

29:50.593 --> 29:53.533
Na Na unni?
Na Na...

29:55.563 --> 29:57.323
Are you a stalker?

29:57.453 --> 29:58.612
I'm getting sick of it now.

29:58.613 --> 30:00.282
I wanted coffee too.

30:00.283 --> 30:03.553
Teacher, who is this man?

30:04.313 --> 30:07.283
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30:08.863 --> 30:11.682
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

30:11.683 --> 30:16.463
Hey, why are you so clumsy?
Be more careful.

30:18.993 --> 30:21.053
Please drink this.

30:21.283 --> 30:27.073
My teacher acts so rough towards women,
but you act so gentle.

30:27.443 --> 30:29.733
Thank you, I'll enjoy it.

30:30.593 --> 30:32.932
Hey, you said it's my coffee.
Why are you giving my coffee to this man?

30:32.933 --> 30:35.182
You said you gave up coffee.

30:35.183 --> 30:37.742
Please have a nice time chatting.

30:37.743 --> 30:40.043
I have to get back to work.

30:43.403 --> 30:45.622
Why did Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
come all the way here?

30:45.623 --> 30:49.352
That pretty man is a prosecutor?

30:49.353 --> 30:51.882
If he's a prosecutor,
that means he's really smart, right?

30:51.883 --> 30:53.862
Why?
Are you interested?

30:53.863 --> 30:55.462
What about Lee Yoon Sung?

30:55.463 --> 30:58.362
Love is something that shifts...

30:58.363 --> 31:01.132
I like men who are gentle.

31:01.133 --> 31:04.493
Teacher is too rough towards women.

31:07.353 --> 31:11.532
You said you approached Steve Lee
to invest in the deer ranch.

31:11.533 --> 31:17.472
And that Steve Lee approached
Chairman Chun Jae Man. Why?

31:17.573 --> 31:18.972
How am I supposed to know
other people's motives?

31:18.973 --> 31:24.953
Haewon Group looks good on the outside,
but it's core is weak.

31:25.753 --> 31:30.902
Financially, it's on the verge of collapse,
and it's debt ratio is extremely high.

31:30.903 --> 31:32.303
Is that so?

31:32.773 --> 31:34.632
It's a good thing I didn't buy their stocks.

31:34.633 --> 31:38.164
Their subsidiary companies'
credit guarantees are all linked,

31:38.165 --> 31:42.381
so if the base falls,
they'll all collapse as well.

31:42.693 --> 31:46.263
And that base is... Haewon Construction.

31:48.983 --> 31:53.033
Steve Lee seems to have become
Haewon Construction's president recently.

31:53.333 --> 31:58.523
I think Steve Lee's motive
is like this piece.

32:15.563 --> 32:16.512
Da Hye.

32:16.513 --> 32:17.222
Unni.

32:17.223 --> 32:19.932
Can you make me a coffee
that you're most confident about?

32:19.933 --> 32:20.912
All right.

32:20.913 --> 32:24.502
Then... how about
an iced cafe latte with a heart?

32:24.503 --> 32:25.372
Okay.

32:25.373 --> 32:29.692
Unni, he seems to be Teacher's friend
but he's a prosecutor.

32:29.693 --> 32:31.833
He's very good looking.

32:37.133 --> 32:39.992
Da Hye, I'm in a rush can you hurry up?

32:39.993 --> 32:41.603
Yes.

32:54.423 --> 32:57.392
Try it, Da Hye made it herself.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.073
Da Hye?

32:59.083 --> 33:03.903
Yes, she's pretty good at it now
and she knows how to make a heart too.

33:07.593 --> 33:09.383
It's delicious.

33:09.643 --> 33:13.022
It's probably more delicious
since Da Hye made it.

33:13.023 --> 33:14.300
Thank you.

33:14.301 --> 33:17.592
It feels like the day's tiredness
is fading away.

33:17.743 --> 33:19.973
Then enjoy the drink.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.043
Na Na.

33:42.703 --> 33:44.332
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo...

33:44.333 --> 33:48.652
I waited hoping
I might be able to see you when you got off.

33:48.653 --> 33:51.453
What could we possibly have to talk about?

33:51.763 --> 33:55.673
Just pretend you don't know me.

33:56.653 --> 34:02.103
I haven't officially apologized yet.

34:02.633 --> 34:06.902
That day at the office,
I knew you were really surprised,

34:06.903 --> 34:10.003
but I didn't have time to explain
the misunderstanding because of my dad.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.953
I know these kinds of words
aren't important right now...

34:15.953 --> 34:18.371
I'm sincerely sorry, Na Na.

34:18.373 --> 34:20.953
It's not your fault, Prosecutor.

34:21.933 --> 34:26.842
I know your heart wasn't at ease too...

34:27.503 --> 34:33.262
All this time, you must have lived feeling
like I was a fishbone stuck in your throat.

34:33.297 --> 34:35.297
I know all of that.

34:36.623 --> 34:41.134
So that's why you played the role
of Daddy Long Legs Ahjussi for me.

34:41.135 --> 34:43.449
I'm grateful for that.

34:44.193 --> 34:46.833
I don't know what to say, Na Na...

34:47.143 --> 34:52.143
Regardless... I can't forget.

34:53.003 --> 34:56.003
The things Chairman Kim Jong Shik said...

34:57.643 --> 35:00.613
After abandoning my parents
who were in the accident,

35:02.743 --> 35:10.033
saying he was lucky one of my parents died
and the other is in a coma.

35:12.523 --> 35:15.923
How can someone be so shameless?

35:16.353 --> 35:19.173
How can he be so cruel?

35:21.013 --> 35:23.983
I feel so much gratitude towards you,
Prosecutor,

35:24.443 --> 35:28.183
but when I think of your father...

35:29.493 --> 35:34.303
I don't know what I should do.

35:37.823 --> 35:39.523
I'm sorry.

35:54.233 --> 35:55.962
Welcome.

35:55.963 --> 35:57.913
Oh, Na Na.

35:57.963 --> 36:02.102
Unni, don't you want to drink soju tonight?

36:02.103 --> 36:03.962
I think you're the one who wants to.

36:03.963 --> 36:05.393
Can you tell?

36:06.673 --> 36:09.523
I was just about to close,
should we drink here?

36:10.953 --> 36:13.673
I bought canned silkworm.
That's okay, right?

36:16.983 --> 36:18.343
Here.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.863
Cheers.

36:26.973 --> 36:28.002
It's good.

36:28.003 --> 36:31.232
If you act unnaturally cheerful,
it means something happened.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.363
You've become a ghost*.
(*meaning she knows everything)

36:34.533 --> 36:39.492
These days, Daddy Long Legs Ahjussi
isn't Daddy Long Legs Ahjussi...

36:39.493 --> 36:43.412
and you're the only one
whom I can talk to openly.

36:43.413 --> 36:46.632
You found out that Prosecutor Kim...

36:46.633 --> 36:49.313
is Chairman Kim Jong Shik's son?

36:50.213 --> 36:52.143
You knew too?

36:52.473 --> 36:55.432
You probably knew from watching the news.

36:55.433 --> 36:59.523
No, I've known for a while...

36:59.643 --> 37:03.723
that Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
was your Daddy Long Legs Ahjussi

37:04.783 --> 37:08.423
and that he was Kim Jong Shik's son.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.973
How did you know?

37:14.053 --> 37:18.553
It wasn't my intention to deceive you,
I'm sorry.

37:19.363 --> 37:23.223
Kim Young Joo is my ex-husband.

37:26.223 --> 37:30.192
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
asked me not to tell you.

37:30.193 --> 37:35.743
He felt really bad watching you go through
such hard times, because of his father.

38:01.653 --> 38:04.103
Why... Why are you doing that?

38:10.603 --> 38:14.173
[Director Jin Sae Hee]

38:16.113 --> 38:17.173
Yes, Sae Hee.

38:25.783 --> 38:27.127
I'm sorry...

38:27.128 --> 38:30.953
Na Na seems to be upset about a lot
of things and drank until she passed out.

38:30.983 --> 38:36.353
I thought it was best
that you took her home.

38:36.583 --> 38:39.302
But did something happen?

38:39.303 --> 38:44.283
She said she doesn't have anyone
she can openly talk to anymore.

39:52.033 --> 39:54.603
What made you drink?

39:56.993 --> 39:58.783
Was it because of me?

40:04.593 --> 40:06.943
I seem so stupid, right?

40:09.703 --> 40:14.823
I asked you to let me go,
but I can't stand it.

40:17.553 --> 40:20.373
I can't give you up* to another man...

40:22.623 --> 40:25.343
but I can't keep you by my side either.

40:38.153 --> 40:42.983
Kim Na Na... don't be in pain.

41:03.983 --> 41:08.702
2030 Classified Documents
and the wrongful interview you had,

41:08.703 --> 41:10.632
I'm going to make it right.

41:10.633 --> 41:14.163
You've become very weak, Mr. President.

41:14.173 --> 41:17.292
You're scared to death
because of a little prank.

41:17.293 --> 41:21.872
You and Lee Jin Pyo, how did
you come to attend the meeting together?

41:21.873 --> 41:23.683
Lee Jin Pyo?

41:23.713 --> 41:29.713
I came with
Haewon Construction's CEO Steve Lee.

41:29.733 --> 41:34.552
I don't know what the 2 of you are plotting,
but quit right now.

41:34.553 --> 41:37.842
I'm saying this for your own good.

41:37.843 --> 41:39.724
Aren't you overstepping
your presidential authority,

41:39.725 --> 41:42.154
by interfering in my company's affairs?

41:44.023 --> 41:45.451
Never mind that.

41:45.452 --> 41:50.223
Have you considered the Healthcare
Privatization Bill I proposed to you?

41:50.243 --> 41:51.766
As long as I'm still in office,

41:51.767 --> 41:54.643
I'll absolutely never pass
a bill to privatize healthcare.

41:54.723 --> 41:57.693
Your term will be over soon.

41:58.003 --> 42:01.055
You should prepare* for your departure**
by making compromises wherever you can.

42:01.058 --> 42:02.063
[*like olden times, burial offerings: people
who'll go with him **term over and death]

42:02.083 --> 42:04.732
The instant healthcare is privatized,

42:04.733 --> 42:08.422
the fort which guards the health
of underprivileged citizens will fall!

42:08.423 --> 42:10.462
The employees at your company
who got sick from chemical exposure,

42:10.463 --> 42:13.963
the current healthcare system
is what's protecting them.

42:14.533 --> 42:19.173
A lot of people are displeased
with my proposal to privatize healthcare.

42:19.353 --> 42:24.363
Did all the people who work at my factory
get sick?

42:25.063 --> 42:29.093
The Republic of Korea is reaching its
silver era*. (*population is growing old)

42:29.813 --> 42:32.452
Right now the youth
are working their butts off...

42:32.453 --> 42:36.422
and all their efforts go towards
paying for the old people's health problems.

42:36.423 --> 42:41.763
If you want to become a great president,
you have to leave a legacy behind.

42:44.423 --> 42:49.342
Also, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
is getting close to the secret records.

42:49.343 --> 42:51.923
Before the classified documents
are discovered,

42:52.803 --> 42:58.352
you should cut off the arms and legs
of that callow prosecutor.

42:58.353 --> 43:01.673
Sacrificing the lives of the youth
in order to save ourselves...

43:01.963 --> 43:04.533
Once before was enough.

43:05.093 --> 43:08.012
Don't touch Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

43:08.013 --> 43:10.634
Once the Private School Amendment
gets approved,

43:10.635 --> 43:13.617
I'm going to reveal Operation Clean Sweep.

43:21.993 --> 43:23.692
I shouldn't have said anything.

43:23.693 --> 43:27.293
I got angry because you got demoted.

43:28.483 --> 43:30.393
I'm sorry.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.922
What are you sorry about?

43:32.923 --> 43:36.762
I'm sorrier because you're going to get
the heat from the chief because of me.

43:36.763 --> 43:38.588
As soon as you started investigating
Haewon's Chairman Chun,

43:38.589 --> 43:40.158
I knew this would happen.

43:40.223 --> 43:41.962
The power he wields...

43:41.963 --> 43:44.892
Do you know how many prosecutors
are in the palm of his hands?

43:44.893 --> 43:47.552
They only act
in accordance to what he wants.

43:47.553 --> 43:49.345
So, you didn't know that changing the
prosecutor in charge

43:49.346 --> 43:52.222
and getting a demotion were going
to be the sequence of events?

43:52.223 --> 43:54.112
You're always just saying
you're going to take responsibility.

43:54.113 --> 43:55.612
You're really frustrating, Prosecutor.

43:55.613 --> 43:57.453
[City Hunter Investigation Log]

44:53.753 --> 44:56.082
Don't whisper too much.

44:56.083 --> 45:00.563
Yes, I'm going to Daecheon
because I got demoted.

45:06.163 --> 45:07.032
Chief.

45:07.033 --> 45:08.392
Who's got your back?

45:08.393 --> 45:09.763
What?

45:12.963 --> 45:14.722
What are you talking about?

45:14.723 --> 45:17.073
Your demotion got revoked.

45:17.323 --> 45:20.682
They're telling you to stay
at the Seoul District Office.

45:20.683 --> 45:22.802
Chief, are you playing with me right now?

45:22.803 --> 45:26.443
Would the chief run all the way here
to play with you?

45:26.523 --> 45:30.523
The City Hunter and Chairman Chun Jae Man,
you handle the investigations, all of them.

45:31.413 --> 45:33.052
Really?

45:33.053 --> 45:34.862
How did it suddenly...?

45:34.863 --> 45:36.933
You're enjoying this too much.

45:36.983 --> 45:38.232
But stop dreaming,

45:38.233 --> 45:42.193
it's going to be hard to even get them
on the news with just those files.

45:44.333 --> 45:46.172
Why?
Why can't I?

45:46.173 --> 45:48.760
Someone snuck in and stole waste
for analysis.

45:48.761 --> 45:49.843
Do you think Haewon will acknowledge this?

45:49.903 --> 45:53.002
It's a complete violation of labor laws
and environmental safety laws.

45:53.003 --> 45:54.082
Shut up.

45:54.083 --> 45:55.773
Chief.

45:56.043 --> 45:58.009
The Prosecutor's Office
is an independent institution,

45:58.010 --> 46:00.548
so I originally didn't want to interfere,

46:00.563 --> 46:02.062
but there's a young prosecutor
who wants to investigate...

46:02.063 --> 46:04.022
by putting everything on the line and...

46:04.023 --> 46:07.063
I didn't want to sap him of that drive.

46:07.643 --> 46:08.992
Yes.

46:08.993 --> 46:11.792
Thank you for your assistance,
Attorney General.

46:11.793 --> 46:15.093
Yes, yes.
Thank you.

46:15.203 --> 46:18.262
Dr. Lee, sorry.
I'm sorry I made you wait.

46:18.263 --> 46:20.302
I unexpectedly got a phone call.

46:20.303 --> 46:21.893
It's fine.

46:22.353 --> 46:26.622
Is the prosecutor whom you're talking about
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo?

46:26.623 --> 46:27.792
You know him?

46:27.793 --> 46:30.522
He's been quite the talk lately.

46:30.523 --> 46:33.373
And there was
the Chairman Kim Jong Shik case too.

46:36.523 --> 46:43.582
Dr. Lee, if you had 10 hours
left before an exam...

46:43.583 --> 46:49.542
and you had to study for both math
and English, what would you do?

46:49.843 --> 46:54.273
If you study for both, you'll fail both
so you have to choose one.

46:54.353 --> 46:57.692
It's a matter of choice and focus.

46:57.693 --> 47:03.113
Choice and focus...
Yes, that's the perfect answer.

47:03.743 --> 47:08.693
The president's position
is always a matter of choice and focus.

47:08.883 --> 47:10.953
But that moment is always hard.

47:11.413 --> 47:14.612
What can I do to make more people happy?

47:14.613 --> 47:20.589
My choice must not become an impediment
to the future of the Republic of Korea.

47:23.677 --> 47:26.442
I asked the young doctor to come
and here I am talking nonsense.

47:26.443 --> 47:27.642
I'm sorry.

47:27.643 --> 47:29.302
Let's start the computer lesson again.

47:29.303 --> 47:31.312
Last time, you said
after you upload the picture...

47:31.313 --> 47:35.202
you can adjust the size of it,
like this right?

47:35.203 --> 47:36.421
- Yes.
- Ah...

47:36.722 --> 47:38.750
When you want to print it,

47:39.013 --> 47:43.622
with the smart phone,
you can print it right away.

47:43.623 --> 47:44.833
Oh.

47:50.293 --> 47:52.023
Here you go.

47:52.963 --> 47:57.493
Communications and network technology
is really amazing.

47:57.683 --> 48:03.383
Since we're printing, can you print
a few pictures of my youngest daughter?

48:03.418 --> 48:04.572
I want to have them for my desk.

48:04.573 --> 48:05.943
Yes.

48:13.363 --> 48:17.482
Mr. President, you seem like a great father.

48:17.483 --> 48:18.893
Me?

48:19.523 --> 48:22.883
I'm probably a 20 percent dad, at best.

48:23.273 --> 48:26.013
Your father is the one who is admirable.

48:26.014 --> 48:32.014
He raised a great son
and even sent you here to work for Korea.

48:33.253 --> 48:34.192
Here you go.

48:34.193 --> 48:37.092
Yes, thanks Dr. Lee.

48:37.093 --> 48:41.143
I'll take you somewhere nice
for doing this for me.

48:54.103 --> 48:56.153
It's the boss's schedule.

48:56.403 --> 48:57.926
He's going to meet with Chairman Chun,

48:57.927 --> 48:59.452
high-ranking government officials
and assemblymen,

48:59.473 --> 49:02.042
and give them money.

49:02.043 --> 49:05.502
The times and locations are all there.

49:05.503 --> 49:07.112
Why are you giving this to me?

49:07.113 --> 49:09.903
I really can't understand the boss.

49:10.733 --> 49:14.548
If he just reveals the records
classified until 2030,

49:14.576 --> 49:16.653
then I can reclaim my dead hyung's honor.

49:16.683 --> 49:20.372
But why is he working
with Chairman Chun and paying out bribes?

49:20.373 --> 49:22.663
I can't understand it.

49:32.833 --> 49:36.573
<i>Today I put bundles of cash
inside seaweed boxes.</i>

49:37.383 --> 49:39.332
In each box, there's 30 million won.

49:39.333 --> 49:43.673
Father isn't someone
who's interested in money.

49:44.353 --> 49:47.893
There's definitely a bigger plan.
I'm sure of it.

49:53.783 --> 49:55.012
Hold on.

49:55.013 --> 50:00.992
Tonight at 7, he's meeting two assemblymen
at Haewon Hospital Anti-Aging Center.

50:01.293 --> 50:02.902
What?

50:02.903 --> 50:04.932
What did you just say?!

50:04.933 --> 50:07.662
He said he had to repay 3 billion won
today...

50:07.663 --> 50:09.423
so he borrowed the money from the bank,

50:09.424 --> 50:12.324
using the Haewon Construction contract
as collateral.

50:12.403 --> 50:14.443
That's what President Steve Lee did.

50:14.883 --> 50:18.147
If you fail to meet today's deadline
as noted on the promissory note,

50:18.148 --> 50:20.631
Haewon Construction
will enter the first phase of bankruptcy.

50:20.663 --> 50:24.212
How can there be a loan
when I don't know about it?

50:24.213 --> 50:29.972
Haewon Construction's CEO personally
came here, do I still have to report to you?

50:29.973 --> 50:31.052
Hold on.

50:31.053 --> 50:33.372
I'm raising funds now,
so I'll definitely be able to pay on time.

50:33.373 --> 50:36.612
Be aware, you have to pay before we close.

50:36.613 --> 50:38.393
Director Park!

50:38.773 --> 50:40.112
It's not like you've only dealt with Haewon
for a year or two.

50:40.113 --> 50:42.842
It won't take long
to get 3 billion won together.

50:42.843 --> 50:44.713
Just wait...

50:55.983 --> 50:59.942
If I hadn't emptied my slush funds
to take over Han-Il Life,

50:59.943 --> 51:02.163
that 3 billion won would be nothing.

51:04.333 --> 51:06.023
Lee Jin Pyo...

51:07.233 --> 51:09.463
you dare stab me in the back?

51:10.803 --> 51:12.326
You weren't trying
to take over my company,

51:12.327 --> 51:15.829
you wanted to turn me into a beggar,
is that it?

51:16.223 --> 51:18.813
And you spent 300 billion won to do it!

51:20.333 --> 51:22.813
Did something happen?

51:27.643 --> 51:29.133
Oh...

51:30.753 --> 51:34.603
The assemblymen are probably waiting,
why aren't you inside?

51:35.773 --> 51:41.093
Go ahead,
I have to take care of something first.

51:41.333 --> 51:42.903
Okay.

51:58.313 --> 51:59.863
You...

52:02.103 --> 52:04.353
are finished.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.682
Oh, this really works.

52:09.683 --> 52:11.792
Assemblyman Lee's face
looks so much more youthful.

52:11.793 --> 52:15.446
If the Healthcare Privatization Bill
is passed,

52:15.481 --> 52:17.512
you can pay for all this
with private insurance.

52:17.547 --> 52:19.652
I know.

52:19.653 --> 52:24.703
But the citizens are enjoying the perks
of the health care system right now.

52:24.863 --> 52:27.513
Every vote counts.

52:27.683 --> 52:33.002
If we lose our assemblymen seats,
it would be hard to recover from that.

52:33.003 --> 52:34.852
I'm counting on you.

52:34.853 --> 52:37.564
If the two of you change your minds,

52:37.599 --> 52:42.973
the president will fully support
the Private School Amendment

52:43.041 --> 52:44.780
with its half priced tuition provision.

52:44.781 --> 52:45.985
He promises that.

52:46.020 --> 52:49.273
Oh... really?

52:49.513 --> 52:53.653
If that's what the president wants,
I'll reconsider.

52:55.693 --> 52:57.962
In order to express my gratitude,

52:57.963 --> 53:00.722
I placed a little gift inside your lockers.

53:00.723 --> 53:03.223
It's seaweed that's been cultivated
using traditional methods.

53:03.458 --> 53:06.423
Please take it with you and enjoy it.

54:28.363 --> 54:31.462
Chun Jae Man, Lee Jin Pyo,
they're plotting something.

54:31.463 --> 54:33.832
The people they are meeting with
are all officials in specific positions.

54:33.833 --> 54:34.925
Namely, the Health and Welfare Minister

54:34.926 --> 54:36.871
and the Ministry of Health and Welfare
committee members.

54:36.943 --> 54:40.395
Lee Young Tae is the assemblyman
who most opposes privatizing healthcare.

54:40.396 --> 54:42.740
If there is bribery going on,
he'll be first on the list.

54:42.783 --> 54:45.092
I'm sure they're lobbying.

54:45.093 --> 54:48.022
But if we go in there without a warrant,
we're going to get kicked out right away.

54:48.023 --> 54:49.543
What's wrong?

54:57.423 --> 54:59.353
It's the City Hunter.

55:03.373 --> 55:05.702
That City Hunter is going to drive me crazy!

55:05.703 --> 55:09.593
Hey, are you okay?
Hey, hey...

55:52.483 --> 55:54.143
Go Ki Joon.

55:54.643 --> 55:57.063
Is Lee Yoon Sung there right now?

55:59.303 --> 56:03.253
You say he went out?
I understand.

56:05.613 --> 56:09.572
We know the assemblymen are here
but the employees won't tell us.

56:09.573 --> 56:10.792
What do we do?

56:10.793 --> 56:13.082
Without a warrant,
we can't go searching door to door...

56:13.083 --> 56:15.083
I'm going to the Blue House.

56:16.973 --> 56:20.913
Oh, my God... I'm going crazy.

56:33.263 --> 56:35.373
The present...

56:36.383 --> 56:42.383
The truth is it's not in the lockers
but in the car trunks.

56:43.193 --> 56:44.573
What?

56:44.943 --> 56:46.762
There are a lot of eyes watching.

56:46.763 --> 56:48.912
I was careful in getting them together...

56:48.913 --> 56:52.463
so it would be a waste
if something were to happen to it.

56:53.143 --> 56:57.682
You're so careful.
Thank you.

56:57.683 --> 56:59.083
Then...

57:02.993 --> 57:04.953
What are you making that face for?

57:05.533 --> 57:11.003
Why do you keep paying bribe money to the
assemblymen and the high-ranking officials?

57:11.853 --> 57:13.552
The reason I agreed to work with you...

57:13.553 --> 57:17.402
I know. To reinstate the honor
of Officer Kim Sang Soo...

57:17.403 --> 57:20.622
But why do you keep pushing back
the punishment?

57:20.623 --> 57:22.723
I don't understand.

57:23.033 --> 57:26.593
Chun Jae Man
is going to be caught in my hands very soon.

57:26.743 --> 57:28.953
Just wait a little.

57:29.123 --> 57:31.623
It's no fun if you know ahead of time.

57:32.793 --> 57:36.993
By the way, didn't you say today
is the anniversary of your mother's passing?

57:38.083 --> 57:39.412
Yes.

57:39.413 --> 57:41.553
Go and pay your respects.

57:45.173 --> 57:46.202
Hello?

57:46.203 --> 57:48.503
It's Hanyang City Gas Company.

57:48.823 --> 57:49.762
What is it?

57:49.763 --> 57:53.673
There was a report
that there's a gas leak in your home.

57:53.863 --> 57:55.823
Gas leak?

57:56.793 --> 58:00.862
You should go to the house right now,
we'll send one of our employees.

58:00.863 --> 58:02.643
I understand.

58:04.313 --> 58:07.152
There's a gas leak at your place.

58:07.153 --> 58:09.153
Gas leak?

58:10.993 --> 58:14.543
I'll take care of that,
go ahead.

58:24.413 --> 58:26.152
Really, really?

58:26.153 --> 58:28.323
- Oh! No way!
- Really?

58:29.943 --> 58:31.603
Excuse me.

58:31.713 --> 58:33.272
I have something to ask you.

58:33.273 --> 58:34.522
Do you have time?

58:34.523 --> 58:36.683
All of us?

58:36.763 --> 58:39.032
I see that Lee Yoon Sung
is conducting business outside the office.

58:39.033 --> 58:41.322
Yes, he'll be back soon.

58:41.323 --> 58:42.867
The Korea Communications Commission (KCC)

58:42.868 --> 58:46.519
just called to thank us
for the great presentation he did.

58:46.533 --> 58:50.613
Is there anything about Lee Yoon Sung
that sticks out?

58:50.653 --> 58:55.232
The thing that sticks out about him is that
he's weak. He's Blue House's weak spot.

58:55.233 --> 58:57.762
He and Go Ki Joon are very famous.

58:57.763 --> 58:59.196
Every time we enter the training hall,

58:59.197 --> 59:02.836
our ears are pierced
by the sound of them wailing.

59:02.863 --> 59:04.912
How can a man be so weak?

59:04.913 --> 59:09.472
Then again, with those looks and that
education, who cares if he's a little weak?

59:09.473 --> 59:12.363
But why are you asking about Lee Yoon Sung?

59:12.753 --> 59:14.873
I was just asking.

59:15.623 --> 59:17.383
It's Lee Yoon Sung.

59:26.023 --> 59:30.008
The boss tricked us,
to lure you to the locker room.

59:30.043 --> 59:32.207
But he actually put the money
inside the assemblymen's car trunks.

59:32.283 --> 59:34.082
That's definitely something he'd do.

59:34.083 --> 59:36.542
I'm thinking the same thing you are.

59:36.543 --> 59:38.942
Tell me
when you have Father's next schedule,

59:38.943 --> 59:40.492
so we can stop him.

59:40.493 --> 59:41.352
Where's Father?

59:41.353 --> 59:42.622
<i>He went back home.</i>

59:42.623 --> 59:46.753
<i>There was a gas leak
and the gas company called.</i>

59:52.193 --> 59:57.633
<i>He said there was a gas leak
in the apartment so he went home.</i>

01:00:01.093 --> 01:00:02.432
You just came back.
Now, where are you going?

01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:04.952
I forgot a file, I have to go get it.

01:00:04.953 --> 01:00:06.381
Chief Sung Young Tak,

01:00:06.382 --> 01:00:10.992
you just got a call that Lee Yoon Sung
gave a great presentation, right?

01:00:13.483 --> 01:00:15.743
So where are you going again?

01:00:18.743 --> 01:00:24.343
If you leave like this, you're acknowledging
that you're the City Hunter. Got it?

01:00:24.473 --> 01:00:28.823
At Haewon Anti-Aging Center...
That was you.

01:00:29.173 --> 01:00:32.532
My girlfriend is waiting,
I have to ditch work.

01:00:32.702 --> 01:00:34.551
Why don't you cooperate?

01:00:44.791 --> 01:00:46.191
That guy...

01:00:47.193 --> 01:00:48.853
Are you okay?

01:00:54.673 --> 01:00:56.828
Lee Yoon Sung's skills have improved a lot.

01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:59.242
When... when did he improve so much?

01:00:59.243 --> 01:01:02.073
He's the weakest of the weakest.

01:04:23.163 --> 01:04:24.202
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

01:04:24.203 --> 01:04:26.482
If you touch Kim Na Na,
you're going to die by my hand.

01:04:26.483 --> 01:04:29.622
<i>I'll hand over the secret records you want.</i>

01:04:29.623 --> 01:04:32.852
<i>If you find the City Hunter,
give this to him.</i>

01:04:32.853 --> 01:04:34.912
<i>I won't lose to the City Hunter this time.</i>

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.192
<i>I can see the end now.</i>

01:04:36.193 --> 01:04:38.382
<i>Kim Young Joo, come to the front
of the prosecutor's office at 4 pm.</i>

01:04:38.383 --> 01:04:40.442
<i>It would be better to kill her off.</i>

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.212
Kim Na Na. Kim Na Na!
