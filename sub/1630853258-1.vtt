01:53.541 --> 01:57.083
What does the word 'home' mean to you?

01:59.916 --> 02:02.416
Home?

02:04.458 --> 02:09.041
It's someplace safe.

02:13.541 --> 02:15.666
Somewhere...

02:17.625 --> 02:22.416
...you know you can stay, and
you don't have to move on.

02:23.916 --> 02:27.541
It's not someplace temporary.

02:58.583 --> 03:02.125
Scoot up a bit, just a little.

03:03.458 --> 03:07.166
A bit down again.
Like that. Perfect.

03:07.291 --> 03:10.000
I also have to do this.

03:13.166 --> 03:16.875
So if you close your eyes...
- Yes.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.916
...and try to take a deep breath.
Just relax completely.

03:31.833 --> 03:34.916
Have you ever told your story before?

03:36.041 --> 03:37.333
No.

03:38.458 --> 03:42.208
But you're okay with telling me?

03:42.333 --> 03:44.375
Yes.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.833
Then I think that...

03:47.958 --> 03:52.541
You don't have to tell me yet.
Just think back to your earliest memory.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.916
What's the earliest thing
you remember?

04:13.041 --> 04:15.958
I'm three or four years old.

04:18.708 --> 04:21.375
Hey! Watch out!

04:22.541 --> 04:26.750
Where are you?
- We're in Afghanistan, in Kabul.

04:48.083 --> 04:51.083
Can you describe yourself?

04:51.208 --> 04:54.583
I think I always had a tendency...

04:54.708 --> 04:59.833
to be a little different.
Let's just put it like that.

05:03.750 --> 05:07.083
I wasn't afraid of wearing
my sister's dresses...

05:07.208 --> 05:09.916
...my youngest sister's nightgown.

05:10.041 --> 05:12.333
I liked the attention.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.541
Where are you in Kabul?

05:29.541 --> 05:32.833
In the house where I was born.

05:38.083 --> 05:43.833
Where are your parents?
- My mom is inside.

05:43.958 --> 05:46.500
I just know she is.

05:53.750 --> 05:57.916
There you go, sweetie.
That should do the trick.

05:58.041 --> 06:02.750
At night, I put my head on her lap,
and she strokes my hair.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.208
No one can do it like her.

06:06.750 --> 06:12.500
When I look at my mother, I wish I could
see what she looked like when she was young.

06:12.625 --> 06:16.333
I've seen photos of her
with dark black hair,

06:16.458 --> 06:20.625
but I only remember her with grey.

06:20.750 --> 06:25.291
Go back and play.
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

06:33.041 --> 06:37.416
Dad took me by the hand,
and we walked the airstrip together.

06:37.541 --> 06:40.291
He lifted me up and
put me in the cockpit.

06:40.416 --> 06:45.583
It didn't have a steering wheel. It was
like a joystick, with buttons everywhere.

06:45.708 --> 06:48.625
My sister is telling us
stories about my father.

06:48.750 --> 06:52.125
...and then we took off!
He said:

06:52.250 --> 06:56.333
"It's important that you don't
touch any buttons.

06:56.458 --> 07:01.041
"If you hit the wrong one,
it'll go kaboom!"

07:01.166 --> 07:04.458
Then we flew off, into the clouds...

07:04.583 --> 07:08.125
...and we could see
to the end of the world!

07:08.250 --> 07:10.708
It was amazing!

07:12.875 --> 07:17.291
Lots of it is true,
but she makes a lot up too.

07:17.416 --> 07:22.666
My brother and I are completely in awe
of what she is telling us.

07:22.791 --> 07:27.583
He said that as long as he was there,
nothing would ever happen to me.

07:27.708 --> 07:31.541
I remember feeling jealous.

07:31.666 --> 07:34.083
Why were you jealous?

07:34.208 --> 07:38.291
Because she is telling us about
all these great things

07:38.416 --> 07:41.916
that my brother and I never
got to experience...

07:42.041 --> 07:44.791
...being together with our father.

07:44.916 --> 07:48.875
Where is your father?

07:51.750 --> 07:55.875
Can we just talk before we start?
- Yes, of course.

07:57.583 --> 08:03.500
Some things are hard to talk
about. It's still tough,

08:03.625 --> 08:07.083
but I need to come to terms with them.

08:07.208 --> 08:11.458
It's my past, I can't run away
from it, and I don't want to.

08:11.583 --> 08:17.666
I might be ready in
half a year, a year.

08:17.791 --> 08:21.833
Of course.
We'll take it at your pace.

08:21.958 --> 08:26.041
I'm just glad that you are
finally ready to tell your story.

08:27.375 --> 08:32.166
I remember back in high school,
I had no clue.

08:32.291 --> 08:34.750
There were so many stories
going around, like:

08:34.875 --> 08:39.250
"Did you hear he walked
all the way from Afghanistan?"

08:39.375 --> 08:42.958
Good one!
- I didn't know what to believe.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.333
There were stories like that.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.375
Wow!

08:49.291 --> 08:51.958
I remember the first time I saw you.

08:52.083 --> 08:55.041
There weren't a lot
of immigrants back then.

08:55.166 --> 09:00.416
You were wearing a black and white
checkered shirt. Remember?

09:00.541 --> 09:03.166
Yes, I do.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.708
And Buffalo shoes.
- That's me.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.041
I thought, "He's cool."
- Fearless.

09:08.166 --> 09:14.750
You kept staring straight ahead, like
you were trying not to attract attention.

09:14.875 --> 09:21.416
I don't think you noticed me. I was
surprised we got off at the same stop.

09:26.541 --> 09:33.000
Look, I think it's from our Junior year?
- Yes, it's Junior prom.

09:33.125 --> 09:38.666
Check out those fancy shoes!
Everything was tip top.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.458
Here it is.

09:46.875 --> 09:51.583
This is where my story begins.

09:52.916 --> 09:57.250
I wrote it all down,
when I got to Denmark.

09:57.375 --> 10:00.000
Can you try to read it?

10:00.125 --> 10:07.000
It'll be hard. I'm not that good
at reading Dari anymore.

10:16.916 --> 10:20.458
I can't even read my own handwriting.

10:23.291 --> 10:27.208
After the Mujahideen...

10:28.333 --> 10:32.458
The Mujahideen seized power
in Afghanistan...

10:38.375 --> 10:43.500
They killed my father, kidnapped
my sister, and killed my mother and brother.

10:43.625 --> 10:51.500
If I had stayed, they would likely
have killed me too.

10:54.708 --> 10:57.708
It was pretty intense.

11:00.375 --> 11:05.166
Have you told Kasper
any of these stories?

11:05.291 --> 11:06.375
No.

11:13.041 --> 11:17.250
Kasper, I'm going to start filming.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.666
See if it needs more salt.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.500
When are you getting married?

11:28.125 --> 11:31.208
When we find a place to live.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.583
First of all,
I want you to come home.

11:34.708 --> 11:37.958
Secondly, I want a place
where we can have a party.

11:38.083 --> 11:44.000
If we need to wait till we can have
a party, it'll take a while.

11:44.875 --> 11:49.416
Maybe I'll just go buy us
a house while you're away.

11:49.541 --> 11:53.458
You'll just have to
deal with it then.

11:58.833 --> 12:04.083
When do you leave tomorrow?
- I have to be at the airport at 10.

12:04.208 --> 12:09.875
How long this time?
- Till June.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.791
I'll be back for a few months
and then leave again.

12:12.916 --> 12:16.875
You leave again?
- I think so.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.250
Kasper has no idea.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.791
Where are you going?
- Back to the US.

12:24.916 --> 12:28.708
Did you get an e-mail from
your professor at Princeton?

12:28.833 --> 12:33.958
No, a letter. He wants me
to do a post-doc.

12:34.833 --> 12:38.500
To continue your research?
- Yes.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.916
What does Kasper say about that?

12:42.041 --> 12:47.791
We haven't really talked about it.

12:57.208 --> 13:02.416
Last time we spoke,
we talked about your father.

13:02.541 --> 13:05.583
Are you up to talking more about that?

13:05.708 --> 13:08.416
Yes, it's just sad.

13:08.541 --> 13:12.291
If we're back in Kabul
during your childhood,

13:12.416 --> 13:14.666
where is your father?

13:22.125 --> 13:24.500
We don't know.

13:24.625 --> 13:30.083
He was taken away.
- Why?

13:33.791 --> 13:38.791
Arise, you victims of oppression!

13:38.916 --> 13:42.958
Arise, you prisoners of want!

13:44.375 --> 13:49.541
Because the Afghan government
saw him as a threat

13:49.666 --> 13:52.250
to communist rule,

13:52.375 --> 13:57.916
after they overthrew
the monarchy in the late '70s...

13:58.041 --> 14:00.500
...in 1979.

14:07.250 --> 14:14.041
They rounded up about 3,000 people,
including my father.

14:14.958 --> 14:19.750
My mother told me about the day
he was picked up.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.875
She said that he expected it.

14:23.958 --> 14:26.583
Akhtar Nawabi?
- Yes?

14:26.708 --> 14:29.250
We have orders to bring you in.

14:30.208 --> 14:33.791
Wait here. I'll get my coat.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.041
Okay, but hurry up!

14:38.041 --> 14:40.541
They've come for me.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.958
You should keep this...

14:49.083 --> 14:51.375
...just in case.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.833
I'm not a threat to anyone.
I'll be back soon.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.750
Then he was put in jail.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.666
My mom told me that the family
was able to visit him quite often,

15:09.791 --> 15:13.041
but three months later, he disappeared...

15:14.291 --> 15:16.333
...just like that.

15:41.166 --> 15:46.791
Amin, listen. You need to keep it high
and make sure the string is taut.

15:46.916 --> 15:51.333
I spend a lot of time with my brother.

15:51.458 --> 15:57.083
He's a real boy, the kind who gets his
hands dirty. He breeds pigeons on our roof.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.916
Hold it tight! Be careful, Amin!
Give it to me! Give it to me!

16:05.458 --> 16:07.583
Sorry.

16:10.833 --> 16:15.291
I have 69 cards. How many do you have?
- 52.

16:15.416 --> 16:19.791
How about I trade you Vivek Mushran
for Anil Kapoor?

16:20.583 --> 16:22.875
No.
- Please, Sabia.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.666
I said no. I'm not interested.
- But you have two Anil Kapoors!

16:28.791 --> 16:32.041
I'll give you Vivek Mushran
and Mamik Singh for him.

16:32.166 --> 16:36.333
I don't need either of them, and
it's always nice to have a spare Anil.

16:36.458 --> 16:39.916
Look at him! He's so handsome.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.416
Ugh! You really piss me off!

16:43.541 --> 16:47.500
How do you want it?
- I don't care.

16:47.625 --> 16:51.333
Actually, I'm not in the mood for this.

17:12.083 --> 17:15.208
When did you first realize
that you were gay?

17:15.333 --> 17:18.125
I wasn't very old.

17:18.250 --> 17:24.375
I think I've had fantasies about men
ever since I was five or six years old.

17:24.500 --> 17:28.041
I remember one of them very clearly.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.208
I was enamored with
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.666
Seriously. I fantasized about him.

17:37.791 --> 17:42.416
I also liked Jean-Claude Van Damme,
but for different reasons.

17:43.958 --> 17:48.916
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the way
I "liked" him was ... different.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.708
Yeah, well, I...

17:53.833 --> 18:00.291
I kind of knew all along
that I was into men,

18:00.416 --> 18:03.958
without actually knowing what it meant.

18:07.791 --> 18:15.083
In Afghanistan, homosexuals didn't
exist. There wasn't even a word for them.

18:15.208 --> 18:21.041
They brought shame on the family,

18:21.166 --> 18:24.958
so it was hard to accept being gay.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.500
We play volleyball everyday.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.000
Come on!

18:46.125 --> 18:50.333
My brother and I
were quite the team.

18:50.458 --> 18:55.125
My brother is very tall
and great at spiking.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.625
Focus!

19:03.833 --> 19:07.875
These days, terrorists are receiving

19:08.000 --> 19:15.916
brand-new, long-range missiles
from the US government.

19:16.041 --> 19:21.500
The US wants a Vietnam War for the USSR
in Afghanistan, but I'm telling you

19:21.625 --> 19:29.125
that when the US supplies
the terrorists with aid

19:29.250 --> 19:31.250
to destroy Afghanistan,

19:31.375 --> 19:35.708
Afghanistan could well become
a second Vietnam for the US instead!

19:36.375 --> 19:42.375
The civil war began when my father was
taken away. They fought the Mujahideen.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.791
The war isn't fought
in Kabul proper,

19:46.916 --> 19:51.208
so we don't notice it too much.

19:52.583 --> 19:56.916
The only reason I notice it
is because of my brother.

19:57.041 --> 19:59.500
He's a growing teenage boy.

19:59.625 --> 20:04.000
He doesn't want to join the army,
but he has to.

20:16.958 --> 20:18.208
Saif!

20:20.416 --> 20:23.666
The police are coming!
- Stop!

20:23.791 --> 20:25.583
Run!

20:37.750 --> 20:39.083
Saif!

20:49.541 --> 20:51.041
Saif!

20:54.958 --> 20:56.291
Saif!

20:58.708 --> 20:59.708
Mom!

21:00.458 --> 21:04.583
Mom, they're here.
They caught him!

21:06.250 --> 21:12.500
You can't stay here. You need to hide.
Run over to Uncle Mahdi! Go!

21:12.625 --> 21:16.875
Come back when it's dark.
Be careful!

21:17.583 --> 21:23.333
My brother is always on the run.
He isn't the only one either.

21:23.458 --> 21:27.083
Thousands of Afghan boys
don't want to go to war,

21:27.208 --> 21:31.791
and with good reason.
Most of them don't return.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.791
They die.

21:34.500 --> 21:40.375
Oh my country, you suffer,
because you were betrayed.

21:40.500 --> 21:46.916
Oh my country,
you've lost your melody, your voice.

21:47.041 --> 21:52.125
Oh my country,
you are in pain, and there is no cure.

21:52.250 --> 21:55.333
Oh my country...

21:55.458 --> 22:00.000
Mujahedeen attacks are on the rise
in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal.

22:00.125 --> 22:03.083
Yesterday, seven people were killed
near Kabul Airport.

22:03.208 --> 22:08.958
...The last of the American embassy
personnel flew out of Kabul today

22:09.083 --> 22:13.583
and went to India. Most other Western
embassies are either closed or closing.

22:13.708 --> 22:19.875
The conventional wisdom is that when
the Soviets have completely withdrawn...

22:20.000 --> 22:22.375
the Afghans will set on one another,

22:22.500 --> 22:26.625
and the capital will be even more
dangerous than it is now.

22:32.583 --> 22:36.833
The Soviet transport circles downward,
firing magnesium flares

22:36.958 --> 22:39.708
to divert any heat-seeking missiles.

22:39.833 --> 22:45.666
The American-armed Mujahideen guerrillas
are in the mountains around the city.

22:45.791 --> 22:50.416
We know the Afghan army isn't
strong enough to fend off the Taliban,

22:50.541 --> 22:54.583
so it's just a matter of time
before they invade Kabul.

22:54.708 --> 23:02.250
We know they will seek revenge against
people they consider "non-believers."

23:04.833 --> 23:06.125
Amin!

23:06.250 --> 23:09.041
We need to get out right away.

23:09.166 --> 23:13.166
We pack a few things, but
we don't have time to sell anything.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.500
Amin, come on.

23:37.166 --> 23:43.041
So you barely made it out?
- Yes, at the very last minute.

24:22.500 --> 24:27.750
I cry all the way to the airport
and then, on the plane.

24:29.041 --> 24:30.625
Yeah...

25:33.583 --> 25:35.958
We fled to Moscow.

25:37.708 --> 25:42.041
Russia was the only country
that would grant us a tourist visa.

25:44.166 --> 25:48.250
Russia was such a strange place
to be at the time.

25:51.625 --> 25:55.000
We arrive a year
after the fall of communism.

25:59.750 --> 26:03.416
People are starving,
and the supermarkets are empty.

26:03.541 --> 26:10.500
The ruble keeps devaluating,
and they keep printing new notes.

26:12.833 --> 26:18.208
There's a lot of crime,
and you can't trust the police.

26:40.625 --> 26:43.708
Finally!
- Abbas! My son!

26:43.833 --> 26:48.958
My big brother, who lives in Sweden,
meet us in Moscow when we arrive.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.916
He rented an apartment for us.

26:53.041 --> 26:55.708
Oh, my God! You've grown!

26:57.916 --> 27:03.208
He fled in the '80s,
because he didn't want to go to war.

27:10.833 --> 27:12.875
Go back!

27:17.791 --> 27:19.708
Wow!

27:20.708 --> 27:24.333
We need to get them to Sweden
as quickly as possible,

27:24.458 --> 27:28.583
so that they can start school.
If we wait, they'll be too old.

27:28.708 --> 27:32.041
I know. What about you, sweetheart?
Is Sweden treating you well?

27:32.166 --> 27:36.291
Cleaning doesn't pay well,
but it's all right.

27:38.208 --> 27:44.166
$4,600 dollars is all I could put together.
I'll get you more when I can.

27:44.291 --> 27:45.583
Thank you.

27:46.250 --> 27:51.291
When do you have to go back?
- Tomorrow. I only have two days off.

27:56.666 --> 27:58.666
Come here, you two!

28:02.041 --> 28:07.000
I bet it's boring hanging out with
mom and our sisters all the time.

28:07.125 --> 28:10.750
I'll make real men out of you,
when you get to Sweden.

28:10.875 --> 28:15.416
Just you wait!
The girls in Sweden are beautiful!

28:20.750 --> 28:25.208
What's the plan?
- Getting out of Russia.

28:25.333 --> 28:31.291
It costs a lot of money
to get smuggled to Sweden.

28:32.333 --> 28:33.833
By traffickers?

28:33.958 --> 28:38.208
Yes, human traffickers.
It's the cheapest way.

28:39.250 --> 28:44.208
You can get to Sweden for $3,000.

28:44.333 --> 28:47.416
It's $15-20,000 for all of us.

28:48.708 --> 28:52.041
My big brother is under
enormous pressure because of it.

28:52.166 --> 28:55.041
He doesn't make a lot of money.

28:58.458 --> 29:00.875
Stop! Papers, please!

29:02.833 --> 29:04.666
Papers!

29:05.541 --> 29:07.666
Stay there.

29:16.750 --> 29:20.166
Your visa is expired.

29:30.125 --> 29:32.541
Thank you.

29:32.666 --> 29:34.625
Go on.

29:36.916 --> 29:39.000
Beat it!

29:42.666 --> 29:45.833
We couldn't move about the city freely,

29:45.958 --> 29:49.666
because we didn't have
the right papers,

29:49.791 --> 29:52.500
so we stayed in Russia illegally.

29:55.500 --> 29:59.833
I ran away from the police
whenever I saw them on the street.

30:08.666 --> 30:14.250
So, I'd sit at home all day,
watching Mexican soap operas.

30:14.375 --> 30:17.375
The whole family did.
It was the highlight of our day.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.791
Let me help you with that suitcase.
- Oh, thank you!

30:20.916 --> 30:26.041
Is this your first time in Mexico City?
- Yes! I've never seen anything like it.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.416
And so we sit there for a year.

30:30.541 --> 30:34.000
We just sit there, waiting to leave.

30:35.958 --> 30:40.666
It's really hard for my brother
to put together all that money.

30:40.791 --> 30:46.208
Then, there is only enough
to send my sisters.

30:50.541 --> 30:54.458
Call me as soon as you get there.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.000
Of course.

31:00.250 --> 31:04.750
We're not told much about the journey.

31:06.333 --> 31:10.250
Often, the traffickers
don't know themselves.

31:12.791 --> 31:17.750
Then we just wait for
the call from Sweden,

31:17.875 --> 31:22.833
hoping it's them,
saying they're safe.

31:25.125 --> 31:30.666
Those traffickers are such bastards!

31:31.458 --> 31:33.500
I...

31:33.625 --> 31:36.833
I think they're a bunch of psychopaths.

31:36.958 --> 31:38.458
Get in!

31:43.708 --> 31:46.250
You two! Get in!

31:46.375 --> 31:52.958
They are put inside a freight
container, with lots of other people.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.916
It's a bit warm in here...

32:04.083 --> 32:09.666
Then it's loaded
onto a huge cargo ship,

32:09.791 --> 32:13.958
and surrounded by other containers,

32:14.083 --> 32:16.750
blocking it, so they can't get out.

33:05.375 --> 33:08.291
My older brother called.

33:10.375 --> 33:13.291
It was...I mean, it was...

33:16.041 --> 33:18.875
Everything seemed normal

33:19.000 --> 33:23.041
as the MS Estonia arrived in Stockholm
from Talinn this morning.

33:23.166 --> 33:27.708
The 1,100 passengers were unaware
of the drama happening below deck.

33:27.833 --> 33:35.000
This is incredibly inhumane.
It's human trafficking at its worst.

33:35.125 --> 33:42.541
Confined in a trailer were
64 refugees, fighting to get out.

33:42.666 --> 33:45.875
It's unclear how long
they'd been inside.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.666
Of the 64, 26 were children,
the youngest just 8 months old.

34:02.416 --> 34:07.166
They nearly died on the way.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.708
They're not well.

34:11.833 --> 34:16.250
I think it's mainly the shock,
but they aren't saying much.

34:18.458 --> 34:22.625
I know someone,
who can take a look at them.

34:30.000 --> 34:36.500
I just need to get one thing straight:
Your two sisters survived, right?

34:36.625 --> 34:39.208
Yes.
- They're not dead?

34:39.333 --> 34:43.083
And you have an older brother,
and they all live in Sweden.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.833
Yeah.

34:44.958 --> 34:49.541
Because...I thought
your whole family was dead.

34:49.666 --> 34:52.500
Yeah.
- And they're not.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.500
No.

34:57.625 --> 35:00.875
That's fantastic!
It's really great to hear that.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.333
But in all these years, you never
told anyone about your family?

35:08.208 --> 35:13.041
I think it was only
after I started university

35:13.166 --> 35:17.208
that I began
to open up a bit...

35:20.541 --> 35:24.166
...to an ex-boyfriend.
But that didn't go so well.

35:24.291 --> 35:28.625
I told him a little about my family.

35:29.708 --> 35:34.291
At first he seemed...

35:34.416 --> 35:36.166
...very understanding,

35:36.291 --> 35:41.541
but when we had a big argument,
he used it against me.

35:41.666 --> 35:45.833
He said he would call the police
and inform them

35:45.958 --> 35:51.125
that my asylum was based on a lie.

35:52.375 --> 35:59.458
Even after I broke up with him,
I was terrified of it for years.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.625
I think it's a great house.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.916
It's nice.

36:30.041 --> 36:33.041
The property is pretty big.
- It's enormous!

36:33.166 --> 36:37.708
Is that also part of the property?
- Yes, all the way to the road.

36:37.833 --> 36:42.250
It has a lot of potential.
- There's a cat!

36:42.375 --> 36:45.458
It walks around like it owns the place.

36:45.583 --> 36:50.125
If we bring our cat,
they'll have a big fight.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.708
Try calling it.
- What do you say in Danish?

36:55.833 --> 36:59.291
Here, kitty, kitty! Come here.

36:59.416 --> 37:01.833
It wants to.
It's flirting.

37:01.958 --> 37:07.375
Honey, look at all those
hazelnut trees!

37:07.500 --> 37:10.458
I think they're hazelnut.
- Come.

37:10.583 --> 37:13.541
Are they hazelnut?
- Yes.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.375
He's so cute.

37:16.500 --> 37:19.375
They're hazelnut, right?
- Kitty...

37:21.541 --> 37:28.000
I'm not sure. They're not
hazelnut. They just look like it.

37:31.625 --> 37:35.291
You really get into the summer mood
with the heat and...

37:35.416 --> 37:40.791
But can you see yourself living there?
- Yes, I can. - Really?

37:42.333 --> 37:45.833
What do you think?

37:47.875 --> 37:54.125
Would you be able to live there, babe?
I don't want to be out there by myself.

37:54.250 --> 37:59.208
Yes, of course.
- So you won't...

38:00.583 --> 38:04.166
suddenly have all sorts
of commitments all the time.

38:06.541 --> 38:11.208
The narrow roads
and big fields...

38:12.125 --> 38:17.333
...They remind me of my time
at the asylum center.

38:19.208 --> 38:23.750
I'm scared of feeling depressed
out there.

38:30.416 --> 38:35.166
You'll never be a part of this family.
Leave! I never want to see you again!

38:35.291 --> 38:40.583
But I'm carrying our child!
You can't just throw me out!

38:47.833 --> 38:49.833
Police!

38:50.583 --> 38:57.083
We heard a noise. Open the door!
We just want to talk to you.

38:57.208 --> 39:00.083
We need to see your papers!
Open the door.

39:00.208 --> 39:04.875
Fuck! I hate them.
They're the worst people in the world.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.541
They stank of vodka.
It was so disgusting.

39:08.666 --> 39:11.541
We know you're in there! Open up!

39:11.666 --> 39:14.166
The nastiest people imaginable!

39:14.291 --> 39:16.916
Even worse than the traffickers!

39:17.041 --> 39:19.625
We have all day.

39:23.125 --> 39:28.875
I don't remember the day we fled,
or how we got from Russia to...

39:31.750 --> 39:33.791
I don't remember.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.291
We drove for hours.

39:39.416 --> 39:45.333
Now I remember.
We are in a big truck,

39:45.458 --> 39:50.125
which normally carried wood.
They drive us.

39:51.333 --> 39:55.833
We're dropped off in a forest
and have to sit there and wait.

39:55.958 --> 40:01.208
It's really cold, and we
aren't dressed warmly enough.

40:25.958 --> 40:30.958
There are two things I'll never
forget about that night.

40:35.750 --> 40:39.416
Come on, Mother,
We need to keep up.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.125
Faster!
No talking.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.541
Wait!

40:51.250 --> 40:52.291
Stop.

41:01.458 --> 41:04.458
You there!
Keep moving. Go on!

41:50.125 --> 41:53.875
He needs other shoes.
- We don't have any.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.416
Are you kidding? You know we're
sneaking across the border, don't you?

41:58.541 --> 42:00.916
What do you want me to do?
- Take them off!

42:01.041 --> 42:04.583
He can't just take his shoes off!
- If you don't do it, I will!

42:04.708 --> 42:10.375
What's going on? You can't stop.
You have to keep walking. Move!

42:18.458 --> 42:21.125
No! Stop! I'll carry him.

42:21.250 --> 42:23.833
I'll carry him.

42:23.958 --> 42:27.750
We won't wait for you. Go!

42:28.666 --> 42:34.333
You have to stay there, sweetie.
He's helping us...

42:34.458 --> 42:36.291
Thank you.

42:43.958 --> 42:47.041
Wait! Come help us!

42:55.000 --> 42:59.541
She's holding us up.
- Why not shoot her in the head?

43:03.458 --> 43:09.166
"We'll shoot her in the head
and leave her here." So cold-blooded.

43:09.291 --> 43:12.875
I'll do it. It's easy.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
No, I'll make sure she keeps up.
We'll hurry.

43:18.458 --> 43:22.666
I think he said that to her son.

43:30.791 --> 43:33.916
My mother was also old.

43:41.041 --> 43:45.916
That woman... It's good
she didn't understand Russian.

44:05.500 --> 44:11.166
They got this boat to take us to Sweden.

44:11.291 --> 44:14.791
across the Baltic Sea to Sweden.

44:14.916 --> 44:18.666
I know the boat can't...

44:18.791 --> 44:22.583
My mother is terrified of water.

44:22.708 --> 44:25.500
Are we all getting on this boat?
- I guess.

44:25.625 --> 44:30.291
But there's not enough room?
- There has to be.

44:30.416 --> 44:34.625
We'll never convince Mom
to get in that.

44:34.750 --> 44:37.833
She has to. She can't stay here.

44:42.333 --> 44:50.291
You need to stay below deck, so
the coast guard won't see you.

44:50.416 --> 44:55.125
We stripped the inside,
so there's room down there.

44:55.250 --> 45:00.083
It will take two days to get to Sweden.
Let's go!

45:00.208 --> 45:02.583
No... No!

46:05.166 --> 46:10.041
We sail for a couple of hours...
I think.

46:10.166 --> 46:12.958
People start puking.

46:13.083 --> 46:18.083
It's bad, real bad.

46:33.375 --> 46:38.166
Water! Water is getting in!
Help! Help!

46:38.291 --> 46:41.333
Open up!

47:02.000 --> 47:06.083
So you're bailing out water
in the pouring rain.

47:06.208 --> 47:10.083
We need to keep bailing it out,
because it keeps getting in.

47:10.208 --> 47:14.000
The boat doesn't even have
a radio,

47:14.125 --> 47:18.791
so we can't call for help.

47:22.375 --> 47:24.625
No one knows how to swim either.

47:26.791 --> 47:30.625
I think it would have been easier
if it was just me.

47:30.750 --> 47:32.958
My mother was terrified.

47:33.083 --> 47:39.250
Whenever she talked about death,
she always mentioned water.

47:39.375 --> 47:45.416
Dying in water, drowning,
was her worst nightmare.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.166
What's going through your head?

47:56.708 --> 48:01.708
Who do I save first,
if the boat goes down?

48:11.250 --> 48:13.250
Because you knew how to swim?

48:14.708 --> 48:16.041
No.

48:17.333 --> 48:20.875
I didn't really think about that.

48:24.125 --> 48:29.958
Maybe I thought I could.
I have no clue.

48:30.083 --> 48:33.166
I was more concerned...

48:34.666 --> 48:37.791
...about who I would choose.

48:45.458 --> 48:47.875
A few days pass.

49:30.458 --> 49:34.750
Help! Over here!

49:37.416 --> 49:40.916
Over here! Help!

49:42.000 --> 49:43.583
It's from Norway!

50:03.833 --> 50:09.375
I don't know why, but as I stand
there, looking at that ship,

50:09.500 --> 50:13.458
I just can't feel the joy.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
What's wrong?

50:19.666 --> 50:21.250
I'm embarrassed...

50:25.708 --> 50:31.541
...embarrassed and ashamed
of our situation.

50:40.583 --> 50:45.625
People want to jump into the water
and swim to the ship.

50:46.500 --> 50:48.583
I mean...

50:48.708 --> 50:53.083
They think that if they jump
into the water and swim,

50:53.208 --> 50:56.416
the ship will pick them up.

50:56.541 --> 50:59.708
Everyone is so desperate...

51:01.125 --> 51:04.958
It's a fantastic opportunity!

51:05.083 --> 51:07.333
All of a sudden...

51:12.250 --> 51:18.041
everything we want to achieve
is right there.

51:18.166 --> 51:22.541
You could almost reach out and touch it.

51:38.750 --> 51:42.083
We have called the Estonian
border police. They're on their way.

51:42.208 --> 51:45.041
They will take you back.

51:45.166 --> 51:49.083
We have called the Estonian
border police. They're on their way.

51:49.208 --> 51:52.125
They will take you back.

52:09.500 --> 52:12.875
Then the police come and take us:

52:14.750 --> 52:22.708
men in camouflage, with
balaclavas and face paint.

52:22.833 --> 52:28.166
They scream and shout like crazy.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.458
I have no idea what's going on.

52:38.583 --> 52:42.416
I'm crying and crying.
I can't stop.

52:43.791 --> 52:49.416
I can see the fear in the
adults' eyes. They are terrified!

52:49.541 --> 52:53.666
Even the big men... You can see it
in their eyes. They're petrified.

52:53.791 --> 52:57.083
It really scared me.

52:57.208 --> 53:00.708
If they are that afraid,
what will happen to us?

53:00.833 --> 53:04.333
It must be serious.

53:09.458 --> 53:13.208
We are locked inside
an abandoned building.

53:13.333 --> 53:16.416
There are guards,
and on that same day,

53:16.541 --> 53:20.708
they run barbed wire
around the building.

53:20.833 --> 53:23.291
People were in shock.

53:23.416 --> 53:26.125
Based on how they treated us,

53:26.250 --> 53:30.958
we thought we would
be there for the rest of our lives.

53:31.083 --> 53:36.416
We have no idea what will happen to us.
No one tells us anything.

53:39.125 --> 53:43.833
Journalists come and film us.
We hope something will happen, but no.

53:43.958 --> 53:49.458
They get their footage of poor refugees
and go home to do their TV shows...

53:49.583 --> 53:55.875
But nothing actually happens.
It's just us and the guards.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.291
It felt like my life had ground to a halt.

54:05.416 --> 54:07.458
Then, six months later,

54:07.583 --> 54:11.833
they gave us two options:

54:11.958 --> 54:16.500
Stay here to rot, or...

54:18.333 --> 54:21.000
...go back to Moscow.

54:26.875 --> 54:31.708
As soon as we arrive in Russia,
we are arrested by the Russian police.

54:31.833 --> 54:36.166
They want to send us back
to Afghanistan,

54:36.291 --> 54:40.166
but luckily... the Russian police
were so corrupt

54:40.291 --> 54:44.291
that if we gave them the last
of our money, they would let us go.

55:12.291 --> 55:14.791
Thanks for letting me crash here.

55:14.916 --> 55:18.708
Do you want a snack with that?
- No.

55:18.833 --> 55:20.000
What happened?

55:20.125 --> 55:22.666
I just needed to get away.

55:22.791 --> 55:26.583
I told Kasper that
I'm doing my postdoc at Princeton.

55:26.708 --> 55:29.375
It didn't go well?
- No, it didn't.

55:29.500 --> 55:34.125
He feels stupid because
we looked at all those houses.

55:34.250 --> 55:36.875
He doesn't understand.

55:45.250 --> 55:50.125
It seems as if
it's more Kasper's project than yours?

55:50.250 --> 55:55.916
I don't know. It's his dream, but
I'd also like a place to settle down.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.833
But?
- Nothing.

56:01.958 --> 56:06.666
It makes me a little nervous.

56:06.791 --> 56:09.458
Because...

56:09.583 --> 56:15.291
Getting out of Russia
was a tremendous gift...

56:15.416 --> 56:19.833
a tremendous gift.
I got a life.

56:19.958 --> 56:25.500
I couldn't just
give that up or...

56:25.625 --> 56:27.250
Yeah.

56:27.375 --> 56:32.708
If it wasn't for my siblings,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

56:32.833 --> 56:40.208
So, I bear a tremendous burden
on my shoulders...

56:40.333 --> 56:43.708
...you could say.

56:46.333 --> 56:52.166
For example, my brother had
a Finnish girlfriend for ten years.

56:52.291 --> 56:55.750
They wanted children,
but he couldn't,

56:55.875 --> 57:01.833
because he had to save
every penny to get us out of Russia.

57:01.958 --> 57:04.875
His girlfriend left him.

57:08.416 --> 57:14.583
How does not moving to the countryside
help your family?

57:14.708 --> 57:18.458
Aren't you supposed to be on my side?

57:21.416 --> 57:24.833
When are you leaving for the US?
- On Sunday.

57:24.958 --> 57:26.916
Sunday?
- Yes.

57:27.041 --> 57:34.291
How long will you be gone?
- I'm coming home for a few days.

57:34.416 --> 57:39.041
So, three or four months from now?
- Yes.

57:48.375 --> 57:51.833
Look at this place.
I can't believe it's ours!

57:51.958 --> 57:55.250
Only the best for you, my love.

58:00.375 --> 58:06.416
Something happened to my mom.
She started acting strange in Russia.

58:06.541 --> 58:09.291
She got some kind of allergy.

58:14.541 --> 58:18.541
I think she's homesick.
She misses Afghanistan.

58:28.041 --> 58:30.583
It's boring just staying home

58:32.875 --> 58:38.458
I'm a teenager, and I want
to experience something different,

58:40.166 --> 58:42.125
so I go outside.

58:45.000 --> 58:50.625
This is a restaurant of
Moscow-McDonald's joint venture.

58:50.750 --> 58:56.833
This company is known around
the world for its prompt food service.

59:06.125 --> 59:11.250
When we get out of Russia, we should
go to McDonald's to celebrate.

59:11.375 --> 59:16.500
I'd like a Big Mac and a Coke,
thank you! It's going to be so nice.

59:16.625 --> 59:19.833
Hey, you! Come with me!
- No! We didn't do anything!

59:19.958 --> 59:24.208
Let me see your papers then.

59:24.333 --> 59:26.833
Just as I thought.

59:29.083 --> 59:31.875
Stop! Don't...
- Where's your money?

59:32.000 --> 59:35.916
We don't have any!
We just wanted to see what's going on.

59:36.041 --> 59:40.541
Can I see that watch for a second?
- Don't touch him!

59:40.666 --> 59:43.083
Come here!

59:47.708 --> 59:53.208
Look what I found.
- Nice! I'd like to have some fun with her.

59:53.333 --> 59:56.958
Go on. Sit down!

59:57.083 --> 1:00:02.041
What's with them?
- They need to be taught a lesson.

1:00:04.208 --> 1:00:05.958
Sir!

1:00:06.833 --> 1:00:10.583
Why are they here?
- These two? They're greedy. They won't pay.

1:00:10.708 --> 1:00:13.375
What about her?
- She doesn't have any money either,

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:16.833
we thought she could pay us
in another way.

1:00:17.958 --> 1:00:19.583
You two! Out!

1:00:31.125 --> 1:00:35.666
I remember her face...
her black hair...

1:00:37.250 --> 1:00:39.333
...big, dark eyes...

1:00:46.625 --> 1:00:51.875
Fuck! Why didn't I protect her?
Say something? I just let it happen.

1:00:53.166 --> 1:00:59.125
It's one of the most horrible
feelings I ever had.

1:01:01.375 --> 1:01:03.833
I can't do this anymore.

1:01:19.708 --> 1:01:23.750
My brother isn't very old,

1:01:23.875 --> 1:01:27.083
but he assumed responsibility for us.

1:01:27.208 --> 1:01:32.166
He wants to send my mother and I first.

1:01:33.708 --> 1:01:37.625
This time, we're very careful.

1:01:37.750 --> 1:01:43.500
We make arrangements with a
very expensive trafficker,

1:01:43.625 --> 1:01:49.083
because we didn't want to go
through the same things again.

1:01:49.208 --> 1:01:52.958
We insist on a safe, secure route,

1:01:53.083 --> 1:01:57.541
which mean we only have enough
for one of us to leave.

1:01:57.666 --> 1:02:03.208
In the end, my brother decides
that it should be me.

1:02:03.333 --> 1:02:09.166
It was horrible, because I felt awful
about leaving him behind.

1:02:09.875 --> 1:02:13.166
Each week, each month,
each year,

1:02:13.291 --> 1:02:17.166
his chance of having a
decent future dwindles.

1:02:41.916 --> 1:02:46.583
Okay. You have to learn
your name and date of birth by heart.

1:02:46.708 --> 1:02:53.416
You're Russian. Remember that. Speak
Russian if anyone asks you anything.

1:02:53.541 --> 1:02:59.458
Destroy the passport as soon as
you reach your final destination.

1:02:59.583 --> 1:03:05.333
If the police catch you with a fake
passport, they'll send you back to Russia.

1:03:05.458 --> 1:03:08.750
Stick to the story we gave you. It's crucial.

1:03:08.875 --> 1:03:12.541
From now on, you have no family.
They're dead.

1:03:12.666 --> 1:03:17.791
You fled Afghanistan on your own,
without any help.

1:03:17.916 --> 1:03:21.458
If you say anything else,
you'll be shipped back to Afghanistan.

1:03:21.583 --> 1:03:26.000
What do you mean?
- Don't tell anyone about your family.

1:03:26.125 --> 1:03:29.708
You have no family. Understand?

1:03:29.833 --> 1:03:35.416
Good. Now get some sleep.
We have a long day tomorrow.

1:03:45.666 --> 1:03:50.583
The traffickers had all this power
over my life.

1:03:52.166 --> 1:03:55.291
You're left completely powerless.

1:04:17.166 --> 1:04:21.916
I'm with another young guy,
also alone, just like me.

1:04:22.041 --> 1:04:25.791
He's nice and funny.
He makes me laugh.

1:04:25.916 --> 1:04:31.583
He's a bit boyish, but there is
an age difference between us.

1:04:31.708 --> 1:04:35.375
He's closer to becoming a man.

1:04:35.500 --> 1:04:38.833
I think it's kind of sexy.

1:04:40.208 --> 1:04:43.166
I think I have a little crush on him.

1:04:43.291 --> 1:04:46.458
His gold necklace is so beautiful...

1:04:47.333 --> 1:04:52.208
Do you want to try it on?
I'm sure it will look great on you.

1:04:54.583 --> 1:04:57.083
Very nice!

1:05:21.333 --> 1:05:24.916
Our flight to Istanbul will take
around two hours.

1:05:25.041 --> 1:05:29.375
Thank you for flying
Ukrainian International Airlines.

1:05:49.583 --> 1:05:54.375
Once you pass by
passport control on your right...

1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:58.541
Don't stare! Once you pass it,
you're on your own.

1:05:58.666 --> 1:06:05.416
You're going to different destinations.
You're going to Zurich, Gate D27.

1:06:07.083 --> 1:06:13.666
You're going to Copenhagen, Gate A9.

1:06:13.791 --> 1:06:17.916
I thought I was going to Sweden?
- No, you're going to Denmark.

1:06:18.041 --> 1:06:20.583
Denmark? But...

1:06:20.708 --> 1:06:25.791
It's the last trip, so you'll have
to manage on your own from now on.

1:06:25.916 --> 1:06:30.750
Remember to call home
as soon as you land. It's very important.

1:06:30.875 --> 1:06:33.500
That way, I can get my money.

1:06:33.625 --> 1:06:36.375
Okay. Now, go!

1:06:47.250 --> 1:06:51.541
You're going to Zurich?
- Yes, it's in Switzerland.

1:06:51.666 --> 1:06:56.166
Do you have family there?
- Is yours in Copenhagen?

1:06:58.625 --> 1:07:02.791
Hey, thanks for letting me borrow it.
- No, keep it.

1:07:04.375 --> 1:07:05.750
Are you sure?

1:07:07.583 --> 1:07:09.500
Thank you.

1:07:09.625 --> 1:07:12.583
Good luck.
- You too.

1:07:17.958 --> 1:07:21.916
It's weird that I can't remember
his name, when he meant so much to me.

1:07:22.041 --> 1:07:28.041
He was part of something
that had a huge influence on my life.

1:07:29.916 --> 1:07:34.916
Then, all of a sudden, I'm flying
on my own, and landing in Copenhagen.

1:07:48.500 --> 1:07:51.541
I sit there waiting for a while.

1:07:55.416 --> 1:08:00.125
I see this big group of people,
so I start to follow them.

1:08:18.416 --> 1:08:20.250
Move!

1:08:42.958 --> 1:08:45.208
I think I just said "refugee."

1:08:45.333 --> 1:08:48.875
What? Refugee?
- Refugee.

1:08:50.166 --> 1:08:53.416
Where's your passport?

1:08:53.541 --> 1:08:57.208
Karin is here because you're a minor,
who arrived without a guardian.

1:08:57.333 --> 1:09:00.833
A guardian must be present at your interview.

1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:07.833
The interpreter is Iranian and I'm
Afghani, so we miscommunicate.

1:09:07.958 --> 1:09:11.958
Let's start with the formalities.
What's your name?

1:09:17.833 --> 1:09:19.250
Amin.

1:09:19.375 --> 1:09:23.333
We need to know
how you got here.

1:09:27.291 --> 1:09:31.708
There's nothing to worry about.
Just tell us what happened.

1:09:32.833 --> 1:09:38.375
I'm interrogated for hours.

1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:41.375
I'm the only survivor from my family.

1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:46.708
I have to stick to the story
the smuggler gave me.

1:09:46.833 --> 1:09:49.750
I saw my mother and sisters
get killed.

1:09:49.875 --> 1:09:56.125
I'm sobbing. The damn story really
hits me, even though it's not true.

1:09:57.666 --> 1:10:03.750
I'm crying uncontrollably.
The tears just keep coming.

1:10:07.291 --> 1:10:12.541
My father and I hid in the desert
for a year, before he was killed.

1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:20.708
I'm surprised to be crying
over something that isn't true.

1:10:20.833 --> 1:10:25.458
It took a month to get
from Afghanistan to Denmark.

1:10:28.291 --> 1:10:34.416
As soon as I'm done,
I write everything down,

1:10:34.541 --> 1:10:39.291
word for word, in Dari,
in my notebook.

1:10:39.416 --> 1:10:42.416
I have no one. I'm all alone.

1:10:42.541 --> 1:10:45.583
That's the story I told...

1:10:45.708 --> 1:10:48.333
...everyone ... until now.

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:59.875
It is not until we're driving
through the town square,

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.583
and I see the neon lights...

1:11:05.458 --> 1:11:08.916
that I realize...

1:11:11.958 --> 1:11:16.041
I'm not being sent back.

1:11:32.416 --> 1:11:35.000
Hello?
- Abbas?

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:38.833
Amin?
- Yes.

1:11:38.958 --> 1:11:42.083
Finally! Are you okay?
- Yes.

1:11:43.041 --> 1:11:46.000
Where are you?

1:11:46.125 --> 1:11:49.041
In Denmark.
- Oh...

1:11:51.125 --> 1:11:54.541
Why didn't you call earlier?
- I couldn't find a phone.

1:11:54.666 --> 1:11:57.125
What? I can't hear you.

1:11:57.250 --> 1:12:00.416
I couldn't find a phone.
- Okay.

1:12:01.708 --> 1:12:03.958
I'll make the call to Moscow.

1:12:04.833 --> 1:12:09.208
They told me to say
you're all dead...

1:12:11.666 --> 1:12:14.208
...but you're not...

1:12:16.375 --> 1:12:18.541
What do I tell people?

1:12:22.333 --> 1:12:24.666
What do I say?

1:12:27.416 --> 1:12:32.375
You have to do what
the trafficker said. Keep it secret.

1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:35.541
But...
- I'll try to figure out a way to meet.

1:12:35.666 --> 1:12:40.375
I'll let you know.
Take care of yourself.

1:12:41.791 --> 1:12:44.375
Okay, bye.

1:13:08.375 --> 1:13:13.208
It took years before
I could visit my siblings in Stockholm.

1:13:14.958 --> 1:13:20.500
It was very lonely and frustrating.

1:13:20.625 --> 1:13:27.958
The fear of getting caught
and being sent back was so strong...

1:13:29.708 --> 1:13:33.958
...that I couldn't tell the truth.
There were lots of consequences:

1:13:34.083 --> 1:13:36.375
I couldn't be myself.

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.541
It was really painful.

1:13:43.250 --> 1:13:47.000
Most people can't even
begin to imagine

1:13:47.125 --> 1:13:50.500
how fleeing like that affects you...

1:13:50.625 --> 1:13:55.500
what it means for your relationships
with other people...

1:13:55.625 --> 1:13:59.541
how much it destroys you...

1:14:02.458 --> 1:14:06.000
There were things
I couldn't say about my family,

1:14:06.125 --> 1:14:11.083
like that I had siblings in Sweden,
and that my mother was alive,

1:14:11.208 --> 1:14:14.666
because it didn't fit
my background story.

1:14:14.791 --> 1:14:18.416
There were always constraints.

1:14:18.541 --> 1:14:23.083
Things had to be adjusted,
retained, and suppressed.

1:14:27.875 --> 1:14:33.333
So, what did you want to talk about?
- I'd like some medicine.

1:14:33.458 --> 1:14:38.458
Okay, you'll have to see the doctor,
but I can make an appointment.

1:14:38.583 --> 1:14:43.750
What's wrong?
- We spoke about it last time...

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.583
the thing about me
being attracted to men.

1:14:48.708 --> 1:14:52.916
Oh... Oh, that, yes.
- I'd like some medicine.

1:14:55.333 --> 1:14:57.375
What do you mean?

1:14:57.500 --> 1:15:00.333
I want to get well.

1:15:01.916 --> 1:15:04.583
I don't want to like men.

1:15:05.583 --> 1:15:11.375
It's not that I considered it a disease,
but I thought it could be cured,

1:15:12.250 --> 1:15:15.541
that it was something
that could be cured.

1:15:15.666 --> 1:15:19.958
But she told me that
it wasn't that simple.

1:15:21.166 --> 1:15:25.416
Okay, fuck... It's something
that I have to live with:

1:15:29.958 --> 1:15:35.708
the fear of being rejected
by your family

1:15:35.833 --> 1:15:38.875
for being gay,
because it wasn't acceptable.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.666
Family meant a lot to me then,
since I was all alone in Denmark.

1:15:42.791 --> 1:15:45.666
Little brother, you're finally here!

1:15:45.791 --> 1:15:50.916
It was the only reference point
in our fucking, crazy lives.

1:15:51.041 --> 1:15:55.875
The thought of losing that
was very scary.

1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.250
When are you going to find a girlfriend?
Aren't the girls in Denmark pretty?

1:16:01.375 --> 1:16:07.708
Maybe I should come help you out.
I'm sure I could find one for you.

1:16:08.833 --> 1:16:12.791
I didn't dare tell my brother.
I was in Stockholm,

1:16:12.916 --> 1:16:18.125
and I had no plans to tell him,
but it just happened.

1:16:18.250 --> 1:16:23.666
He kept pestering me
about not having a girlfriend.

1:16:23.791 --> 1:16:28.458
Finally, I felt so intimidated
that I said:

1:16:28.583 --> 1:16:33.833
"I don't have a girlfriend because
I'm not interested in girls that way."

1:16:33.958 --> 1:16:37.125
Everyone went completely quiet.

1:16:45.375 --> 1:16:48.541
Are you sure?

1:16:48.666 --> 1:16:50.666
Yes.

1:16:50.791 --> 1:16:54.500
Have you ever been with a girl?

1:16:57.458 --> 1:17:00.125
Amin, let's go.

1:17:00.250 --> 1:17:03.791
Where are we going?
- Just come.

1:17:59.458 --> 1:18:01.166
Come.

1:18:05.250 --> 1:18:08.166
Tell me what's going on.
- You'll see.

1:18:18.666 --> 1:18:20.416
Go on. Have fun.

1:18:49.833 --> 1:18:53.083
There's nothing to worry about.
We always knew.

1:18:54.791 --> 1:18:55.916
Thank you.

1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:11.541
Can I help you?
What would you like?

1:19:17.625 --> 1:19:23.083
There I was. My first time
at a gay club, all by myself...

1:19:23.208 --> 1:19:26.375
and I didn't go home....

1:19:46.416 --> 1:19:49.375
I always made my career a priority.

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:53.500
When forced to choose between a guy
or a career and an education,

1:19:53.625 --> 1:19:57.041
I always chose an education.
Cold and cynical.

1:19:57.166 --> 1:19:59.958
Please welcome our next speaker:
Amin Nawabi.

1:20:03.166 --> 1:20:06.333
My siblings sacrificed so much for me.

1:20:07.416 --> 1:20:12.208
I had to do well.
I felt I had a huge responsibility.

1:20:20.791 --> 1:20:25.000
It was important to be tough.

1:20:27.041 --> 1:20:30.708
Only now, that I'm telling you about it,

1:20:30.833 --> 1:20:36.291
do I start to realize how hard it's been.

1:20:36.416 --> 1:20:38.791
It hurts to think back on it.

1:20:40.375 --> 1:20:42.000
Of course.

1:20:43.458 --> 1:20:46.791
Being back in the US...

1:20:46.916 --> 1:20:52.583
I'm starting to get really tired
of constantly being on the move.

1:20:53.958 --> 1:20:56.208
It's good for my career,

1:20:57.458 --> 1:21:01.750
but it's not that good for...
- It's not that good for you.

1:21:01.875 --> 1:21:04.500
It's not that good for me.

1:21:04.625 --> 1:21:09.416
The first time I interviewed you
back home, you mentioned

1:21:09.541 --> 1:21:14.000
that there were some things
you needed to come to terms with.

1:21:33.208 --> 1:21:37.541
You grow up.
You grow up too fast.

1:21:37.666 --> 1:21:41.666
When you flee as a child, it...

1:21:42.625 --> 1:21:45.791
it takes time to learn

1:21:45.916 --> 1:21:48.166
to trust people.

1:21:50.208 --> 1:21:54.666
You're constantly on your guard,
all the time...

1:21:54.791 --> 1:21:56.750
all the time...

1:21:56.875 --> 1:22:04.041
Even when you're in a safe place,
you're on your guard.

1:22:22.083 --> 1:22:26.125
I can feel that
something needs to happen.

1:23:06.041 --> 1:23:07.916
Ta-da!

1:23:08.041 --> 1:23:11.291
I'm not going to carry you
over the threshold.

1:23:11.416 --> 1:23:16.041
You'd rather carry a cactus instead?
- It's kind of the same.

1:23:18.708 --> 1:23:22.458
I'm just going to put this away.

1:23:25.625 --> 1:23:28.583
It's a little...
- Yeah.

1:23:29.541 --> 1:23:33.333
Look at the view.
It's stunning.

1:23:33.458 --> 1:23:38.625
Every time you look at it,
you're just like, "Wow!"

1:23:40.166 --> 1:23:43.708
The garden is really beautiful
right now.

1:23:43.833 --> 1:23:49.208
I wonder if we have enough stuff
to fill the place.

1:23:58.541 --> 1:24:05.375
Honey, I think I saw a big
raspberry patch just outside the lot.

1:24:12.625 --> 1:24:16.041
Look! That's all raspberries!
- Wow!

1:24:16.166 --> 1:24:20.791
- It's so nice.
- We just need to look after it.

1:24:22.708 --> 1:24:24.875
It's wet here.
- You can see it from here.

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.666
The view of the house
is better here.
