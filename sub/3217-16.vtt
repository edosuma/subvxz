WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:06.547
Storm's coming and you boys,
you are smack in the middle of it.

00:07.882 --> 00:11.552
Dad wants us to pick up where
he left off. Saving people, hunting things.

00:14.222 --> 00:16.765
- The family business.
- We gotta save as many people as we can.

00:18.226 --> 00:21.770
Dean, you and I have seen things
most people couldn't even dream about.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.775
If it's supernatural we kill it.
That's our job.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.695
No, Dean, that is not our job.
Our job is hunting evil.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.740
Well, they're all the same, Sam.
They're not human, okay?

00:32.907 --> 00:34.366
We have to exterminate them.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.243
Our lives are weird, man.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.287
You're telling me.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.187
- We're lost.
- No, this is a shortcut.

01:04.563 --> 01:08.484
Babe, it's just we've been on this road
over an hour. We haven't seen a single car.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.903
Molly, I know how to read
a frigging map, okay?

01:12.322 --> 01:14.865
We passed that gas station.
Let's just go ask someone.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.992
That was 40 minutes ago.
We're not turning around.

01:17.160 --> 01:21.288
Come on.
Isnâ€™t this argument a little archaic?

01:21.873 --> 01:24.374
- Men can ask directions these days.
- Oh, no, no, we can't.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.544
It's against our genetic code.
Look, I know exactly where we are.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.505
Oh, yeah, where?

01:30.006 --> 01:33.425
Highway 99, okay? It cuts right through.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.972
Highway 99?

01:43.061 --> 01:45.270
Okay, so we're taking the scenic route.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.524
David.

01:49.317 --> 01:52.027
It's our anniversary and we're spending it
stuck in the car.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.821
I know. I'm sorry.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.783
Hey, let me make it up to you, okay?
Come here.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.451
No. Stop. I'm mad at you.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.370
Oh, come on, Molly.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.872
Hey, you love me.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.291
No, I don't. You're a jerk.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.547
- David, I mean it.
- Ha, ha-- Molly!

02:11.714 --> 02:12.965
Ahh!
Look out.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.919
David?

02:55.091 --> 02:56.133
Da--?

03:01.097 --> 03:02.890
David?

03:16.404 --> 03:17.946
David?

03:23.786 --> 03:24.828
Da--?

03:24.996 --> 03:26.622
David?!

03:35.548 --> 03:37.799
David?!

03:42.430 --> 03:44.348
David?

04:09.499 --> 04:10.832
Hello?

04:12.210 --> 04:13.252
Is anyone here?

04:16.505 --> 04:18.089
Hello?

04:36.484 --> 04:38.193
It's you.

04:38.361 --> 04:42.322
You're okay. I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you there.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.992
Are you--? Are you hurt?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.203
Sir?

05:29.787 --> 05:31.413
Stop!

05:31.581 --> 05:32.748
Stop!

05:34.667 --> 05:35.917
Holy--!

05:39.505 --> 05:40.922
You've gotta help me.

05:43.092 --> 05:44.468
Please, please.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.929
All right, all right, calm down. Calm down.
Tell us what happened.

05:48.097 --> 05:52.351
I swerved and we crashed.
And when I came to...

05:52.518 --> 05:56.355
...uh, the car was wrecked.
My husband was missing.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.274
I went looking for him
but that's when the man from the road...

05:59.442 --> 06:00.942
...he started chasing me.
He's-- He--

06:01.110 --> 06:04.196
Did he look like he lost a fight
with a lawnmower?

06:05.531 --> 06:06.531
How did you know that?

06:08.284 --> 06:10.118
Lucky guess.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.621
Ma'am, what's your name?

06:12.789 --> 06:15.665
Molly. Molly McNamara.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.460
Maybe you should come with us.
We'll take you back into town--

06:18.628 --> 06:22.381
I can't. I have to find David.
He might've gone back to the car.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.300
We should get you somewhere safe.
Dean and I will come back here.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.845
- We'll look for your husband.
- No. I'm not leaving here without him.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.852
Would you just take me back
to my car, please?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.314
Of course. Come on.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.754
It's right over there.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.010
I don't understand.

07:10.179 --> 07:13.515
I'm sure this is where it was.
We hit that tree right there.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.601
This doesn't make any sense.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.358
We gotta get out of here.
Greeley could show up at any second.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.194
- What're you gonna tell her?
- The truth.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.531
She's gonna take off running
in the other direction.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.617
I know it sounds crazy,
but I crashed into that tree.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.287
I don't know who could've taken it.
It was totaled.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.749
Please, you have to believe me.

07:40.918 --> 07:44.796
Listen, we do believe you, all right?
That's why we wanna get you out of here.

07:45.256 --> 07:49.217
But what about David? Something must
have happened. I have to get to the cops.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.929
Cops. That's a great idea. We'll take you
down to the station ourselves.

07:53.097 --> 07:56.725
So just come with us. It's the best way
we can help you and your husband.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.939
Okay.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.783
We're supposed to be in Lake Tahoe.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.243
You and David?

08:15.995 --> 08:20.123
- It's our five-year anniversary.
- A hell of an anniversary.

08:21.584 --> 08:25.253
Right before, we were having
the dumbest fight.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.007
It's the only time we ever argue,
when we're stuck in the car.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.760
Yeah, I know how that goes.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.681
You know the last thing I said to him?

08:37.767 --> 08:39.142
I called him a jerk.

08:40.436 --> 08:41.770
Oh, God.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.148
What if that's the last thing
I said to him?

08:47.109 --> 08:48.568
Molly.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.780
We're gonna figure out what happened
to your husband. I promise.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.123
- Did you--?
- No.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.294
Great. I was afraid you'd say that.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.340
This song...

09:10.967 --> 09:14.469
- What?
- It was playing when we crashed.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.686
She's mine.

09:22.853 --> 09:26.147
She's mine. She's mine.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.399
What is that?

09:32.738 --> 09:34.155
Hold on.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.032
What are you doing?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.084
What the--?

09:47.169 --> 09:50.589
- What the hell just happened?
- Don't worry, Molly. Everything's all right.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.511
I think you spoke a little too soon,
Sammy.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.366
I don't think he's gonna let her leave.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.299
This can't be happening.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.967
Well...

10:36.218 --> 10:39.179
...trust me, it's happening.

10:50.274 --> 10:55.278
Well, okay, thanks for helping,
but I think I got it covered from here.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.573
- Wait, Molly, wait a minute.
- Just leave me alone.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.950
- No. You have to listen to me.
- Just stay away.

11:01.118 --> 11:04.245
It wasn't a coincidence
that we found you, all right?

11:04.705 --> 11:05.789
What're you talking about?

11:05.956 --> 11:08.083
We weren't cruising for chicks
when we ran into you.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.418
We were already out here. Hunting.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.128
Hunting for what?

11:14.590 --> 11:16.132
Ghosts.

11:18.761 --> 11:22.806
- Don't sugarcoat it for her.
- You're nuts.

11:22.973 --> 11:27.143
Really? About as nuts as a vanishing guy
with his guts spilling out.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.981
You know what you saw.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.158
We think his name is Jonah Greeley.

11:42.702 --> 11:47.288
He was a local farmer
that died 15 years ago on this highway.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.499
Just stop.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.627
One night a year,
on the anniversary of his death...

11:52.795 --> 11:55.130
...he haunts this road.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.841
That's why we're here, Molly...

11:58.092 --> 12:00.135
...to try and stop him.

12:00.302 --> 12:05.056
Yeah, I suppose this ghost
made my car disappear too.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.976
Crazier things have happened, huh?

12:08.394 --> 12:13.398
You know what? I'm all filled up on crazy.
I'm gonna get the cops myself.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.943
I don't mean to be harsh,
but I don't think you're gonna get too far.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.486
What's that supposed to mean?

12:18.654 --> 12:21.239
It means that plan A
was trying to get you out of here.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.325
Obviously, that didn't go over too well
with, uh, Farmer Roadkill.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.914
Molly, we're telling the truth.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.668
Greeley's not gonna let you leave
this highway.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.504
You're...?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.216
You're serious about this, aren't you?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.302
Deadly.

12:45.931 --> 12:49.225
Every year, Greeley finds someone to punish
for what happened to him.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.229
Tonight, that person is you.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.356
Why me? I didn't do anything.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.942
It doesn't matter.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.695
Some spirits only see what they want.

13:04.325 --> 13:09.204
So you're saying this Greeley,
he took my husband?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.291
Oh, God.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.543
Molly, look, we're gonna help, all right?

13:17.880 --> 13:20.590
But first, you gotta help us.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.717
Help you?

13:24.553 --> 13:26.095
How?

13:29.391 --> 13:32.268
This is it. This is where I saw him.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.774
Must've been his hunting cabin.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.613
Huh.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.241
Seemed like a real sweet guy.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.622
- No markers or headstones outside.
- You're looking for Greeley's grave?

13:53.332 --> 13:54.833
- Yeah.
- Why?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.168
So we can dig up the corpse
and salt and burn it.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.964
Oh, sure. Naturally.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.258
It's a way to get rid of a spirit.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.759
And that'll save David?

14:04.927 --> 14:09.430
Well, this is what'll help both of you.
Provided there's a corpse to be found.

14:09.598 --> 14:10.640
So how do we find it?

14:10.808 --> 14:13.935
I'm not sure. After Greeley died,
his wife claimed the body.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.355
That's the last anyone saw of her.
Good guess she brought him back here...

14:17.523 --> 14:20.692
...but they had a thousand acres.
He could be buried anywhere on them.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.028
So this is really what you guys do.
You're like Ghostbusters.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.949
Yeah, minus the jumpsuits. Look,
this is a fascinating conversation and all...

14:28.117 --> 14:29.993
...but this highway's only haunted
once a year.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.163
We got till sunup to wrap this thing up.
What do you say we move it along? Great.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.760
What are we looking for?
- Greeley's house.

14:47.928 --> 14:52.390
Maybe he's buried there. Look for roads
or paths or something. Stay close.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.058
Yeah. Okay.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.567
Molly.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.405
Help me. Molly.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.198
David?

15:11.660 --> 15:14.954
David? David?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.253
Whoops.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.136
Hey, are you all right?

15:30.304 --> 15:32.597
What has that son of a bitch
done with my husband?

15:32.765 --> 15:35.934
Just take it easy, all right?
You're gonna see David again.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.769
- You will.
Hey.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.564
Follow the creepy brick road.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.275
Go ahead.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.207
That thing shoots rock salt?

15:59.375 --> 16:00.375
Yep.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.544
And plain salt keeps away spirits?

16:03.712 --> 16:05.755
Simple remedies are always the best.

16:05.923 --> 16:10.843
Most cultures, salt's a symbol of purity
so it repels impure and unnatural things.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.596
Same reason you throw it
over your shoulder.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.270
You know, just once I'd like
to round the corner and see a nice house.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.726
Any headstones outside?
Yeah, right. Is it ever that easy?

17:01.103 --> 17:02.603
I guess not.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.324
You two check upstairs. See if you can find
notes or records where he's buried.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.243
- I'll just check down here.
- All right.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.230
Great.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.048
Look at this.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.513
It's Greeley and his wife.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.368
It's a love letter he wrote her.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.413
My God, it's beautiful.

18:47.751 --> 18:51.462
I don't understand how a guy like this
can turn into that monster.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.424
Um...

18:56.176 --> 18:58.886
...spirits like Greeley are, uh...

18:59.638 --> 19:01.806
...like wounded animals.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.016
Lost.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.271
In so much pain that they lash out.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.064
Why? Why are they here?

19:10.524 --> 19:15.403
Well, there's some part of them
that's keeping them here.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.157
Like their remains, or, um...

19:21.034 --> 19:22.326
...unfinished business.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.204
"Unfinished business"?

19:25.956 --> 19:28.499
Yeah, uh...

19:28.750 --> 19:34.172
It could be revenge.
It could be love or hate.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.384
Whatever it is,
they just hold on too tight.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.261
Can't let go.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.097
So they're trapped.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.474
Caught in the same loops.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.438
Replaying the same tragedies
over and over.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.815
You sound almost sorry for them.

19:52.983 --> 19:56.319
Well, they weren't evil people.
You know, the--

19:56.486 --> 19:59.030
A lot of them were good. Just...

20:00.282 --> 20:02.450
Something happened to them.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.994
Something they couldn't control.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.624
Sammy's getting a little J. Love Hewitt
when it comes to things like this.

20:11.835 --> 20:16.297
Me, I don't like them and I sure as hell
ain't making apologies for them.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.469
There's nothing downstairs.
You find anything?

20:22.846 --> 20:27.141
Uh, just about every piece of mail
or receipt they ever had.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.186
Looked through a couple,
but nothing about a grave so far.

20:34.024 --> 20:37.068
- What?
- There's something behind here.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.736
Here.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.211
It's locked from the inside.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.571
It smells like old lady in here.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.873
And that would explain why.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.881
Well, now we know why nobody
ever saw her again.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.925
She didn't wanna live without him.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.058
Dean, give me a hand.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.894
Really?

21:56.356 --> 21:57.398
What are you gonna do?

22:00.277 --> 22:02.653
- We can't leave her like this.
- Why not?

22:03.071 --> 22:04.947
She deserves to be put to rest, Dean.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.960
Son of a...

22:22.049 --> 22:24.592
So if you manage to put Greeley
to rest too...

22:26.595 --> 22:27.762
...what happens to him?

22:29.639 --> 22:32.099
Lady, that answer
is way beyond our pay grade.

22:32.267 --> 22:35.102
You hunt these things
but you don't know what happens to them?

22:35.270 --> 22:37.605
They never come back.
That's all that matters.

22:41.610 --> 22:44.362
After they let go of whatever
is keeping them here...

22:44.946 --> 22:46.113
...they just go.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.617
I hope someplace better,
but we don't know.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.119
No one does.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.121
What happens when you burn
their bones?

22:55.123 --> 22:56.165
Um...

22:57.084 --> 23:01.379
Well, my dad used to say that it was like
death for ghosts, you know?

23:02.339 --> 23:05.633
But the truth is, we still don't know,
not for sure.

23:10.347 --> 23:13.808
I guess that's why
we all hold onto life so hard...

23:14.643 --> 23:16.185
...even the dead.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.189
We're all just scared of the unknown.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.900
The only thing I'm scared of
is losing David.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.196
I have to see him again.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.209
I have to.

24:10.073 --> 24:13.284
- We should tell her about her husband.
- We can't.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.997
Dean, it's cruel,
letting her pine for him like this.

24:18.165 --> 24:21.000
- I don't like keeping her in the dark.
- It's for her own good.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.508
I know you feel guilty,
but let's just stick to the plan.

24:29.676 --> 24:32.219
- Let's get her out of here, then we'll tell.
- Tell me what?

24:34.931 --> 24:36.474
What aren't you telling me?

24:40.103 --> 24:42.271
It's about David.
You know what happened to him.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.106
- Molly--
- Sam, don't.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.400
Don't what?

24:46.776 --> 24:49.069
Don't tell me
because I'll mess up your hunt?

24:50.155 --> 24:53.240
- You don't care about me or my husband.
- That's not true.

24:53.825 --> 24:54.867
Really?

24:56.244 --> 24:58.996
Then whatever it is, tell me, please.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.340
He's coming.

25:10.091 --> 25:11.759
Stay with her.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.971
She's mine.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.036
Dean! He's got Molly.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.313
This guy is persistent.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.898
We gotta find Molly.
- We gotta find Greeley's bones.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.276
And, uh, no pressure or anything...

26:52.444 --> 26:55.029
...but we got less than two hours
before sunrise.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.823
Hey.

26:58.366 --> 26:59.575
What do you got?

26:59.951 --> 27:05.247
Uh, "February 6, 1992." That was like
two weeks before the accident, wasn't it?

27:05.415 --> 27:08.500
Yeah. I mean, it looks
like the hunting cabin...

27:08.668 --> 27:11.587
...but I swear there's a tree there
right where they're standing.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.593
- I should've thought of it.
- What?

27:17.761 --> 27:21.597
It's an old country custom, Dean.
Planting a tree as a grave marker.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.726
You're like a walking encyclopedia
of weirdness.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.564
Yeah, I know.

27:31.900 --> 27:36.403
Where's David? What did you do to him?

27:37.113 --> 27:39.823
You shouldn't worry about him anymore.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.325
Oh, my God.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.994
You should worry about yourself.

27:45.246 --> 27:48.582
- I didn't do anything to you.
- Oh.

27:50.960 --> 27:56.715
No. I know about your wife.
Hurting me won't bring her back.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.677
My wife is gone.

28:02.889 --> 28:06.642
All I got left's hurting you.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.779
Please. Please, just let me go.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.739
Go?

28:21.449 --> 28:23.200
You're not gonna leave.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.245
You're never gonna leave.

28:36.756 --> 28:37.798
Go get Molly.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.187
Oh, thank God.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.982
Yeah, call me Dean.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.532
This guy's really pissing me off.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.126
Hurry up, Sam!

30:28.201 --> 30:31.078
Oh, baby, it's been a long night.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.167
All right...

30:38.545 --> 30:40.420
...let's get you out of here.

30:40.588 --> 30:44.383
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me
what happened to my husband.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.762
- Molly.
- All this time...

30:48.930 --> 30:52.015
...I've been looking for him
and you knew that...

30:52.433 --> 30:54.393
You knew that Greeley killed him,
didn't you?

30:57.647 --> 30:58.772
He's dead.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.025
No, Molly.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.111
David's alive.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.530
What?

31:07.448 --> 31:08.574
You're sure?

31:09.784 --> 31:10.993
I'm sure.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.580
We'll take you to him. Come on.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.978
He's in that house, right there.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.481
I don't understand.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.525
You will.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.963
That's not...

32:09.260 --> 32:10.302
It can't be.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.605
What's happening?

32:23.733 --> 32:25.025
Who is that?

32:27.111 --> 32:28.862
That's David's wife.

32:36.537 --> 32:38.080
I'm sorry, Molly.

32:40.375 --> 32:45.253
Fifteen years ago, you and your husband
hit Jonah Greeley with your car.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.881
David survived.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.050
What are you saying?

32:50.927 --> 32:54.012
We're saying that there isn't just one spirit
haunting Highway 41.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.722
There are two.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.724
Jonah Greeley and you.

32:58.559 --> 33:02.688
For the past 15 years, one night a year
you've been appearing on that highway.

33:02.855 --> 33:05.148
No, that's not possible.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.402
It was our anniversary, February 22nd--

33:08.569 --> 33:10.946
-1992.
- Yes.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.739
Molly, it's 2007.

33:17.912 --> 33:18.954
Oh, God.

33:19.414 --> 33:23.208
- All right, tell me about Highway 41.
- Twelve accidents over 15 years.

33:23.376 --> 33:26.294
Five of them fatal.
All of them happening on the same night.

33:26.462 --> 33:29.131
What are we looking at?
Interstate dead zone? Phantom hitchhiker?

33:29.298 --> 33:30.590
Not quite.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.927
I mean, year after year, witnesses said
the same thing made them crash:

33:34.095 --> 33:35.929
A woman appearing in the middle
of the road...

33:36.097 --> 33:38.807
...being chased by a man
covered in blood.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.017
Two spooks?

33:54.699 --> 33:56.491
Now, where is Molly buried?

33:56.659 --> 33:59.828
She-- She wasn't buried anywhere.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.455
She was cremated.

34:03.833 --> 34:08.253
- So much for burning her bones.
- Yeah, but then what's keeping her here?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.301
Molly!
Ahh!

34:17.638 --> 34:19.431
Some spirits only see what they want.

34:20.641 --> 34:21.975
David?

34:22.393 --> 34:23.435
David?

34:24.478 --> 34:27.313
Stop! Stop!

34:29.317 --> 34:30.817
- Holy--!
Ahh!

34:34.322 --> 34:35.989
You have to help me.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.992
Dean, I don't think she knows
she's dead.

34:41.536 --> 34:43.288
Please. Open up, please?

34:43.456 --> 34:46.373
Okay. All right, just calm down.
Tell us what happened.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.335
- What are you gonna tell her?
- The truth.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.964
She's gonna take off running
in the other direction.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.134
Some spirits hold on too tight.

34:57.011 --> 34:58.303
Can't let go.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.559
And Greeley?

35:04.727 --> 35:06.853
Each year he punishes somebody
for his death.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.690
Uh, chasing them...

35:10.983 --> 35:12.025
...torturing them.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.030
And each year...

35:17.532 --> 35:19.032
...that somebody is you.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.326
But I don't remember any of it.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.495
Because you couldn't see the truth,
Molly.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.126
So that's why he won't...

35:29.961 --> 35:32.212
...let me off the highway.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.423
Because I...

35:35.800 --> 35:36.842
I killed him.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.888
I killed us both.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.568
Why didn't you tell me
when you first saw me?

35:54.735 --> 35:58.238
- Why wait until now?
- You wouldn't have believed us.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.074
And you needed me for bait.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.287
Well, we needed you.

36:08.708 --> 36:09.791
David.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.627
Molly, we brought you here
so you could move on.

36:12.795 --> 36:15.755
No, I have to tell him.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.257
Tell him what?

36:19.635 --> 36:22.429
That you love him? That you're sorry?

36:24.098 --> 36:26.016
Molly, he already knows that.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.812
If you wanna go in there,
we're not gonna stop you.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.315
Yeah, but you are gonna freak him
right out...

36:35.860 --> 36:37.360
...for life.

36:47.830 --> 36:52.292
David's already said his goodbyes, Molly.
Now it's your turn.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.461
This is your unfinished business.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.632
What am I supposed to do?

37:00.676 --> 37:02.260
Just...

37:03.137 --> 37:04.888
...let go...

37:05.681 --> 37:08.600
...of David, of everything.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.311
You do that...

37:11.979 --> 37:13.480
...we think you'll move on.

37:15.024 --> 37:17.192
But you don't know where.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.487
No.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.365
Molly, you don't belong here.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.701
Haven't you suffered long enough?

37:29.497 --> 37:30.997
It's time.

37:32.708 --> 37:34.000
It's time to go.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.886
I guess she wasn't so bad for a ghost.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.225
You think she's really going
to a better place?

38:33.602 --> 38:34.728
I hope so.

38:36.731 --> 38:39.941
I guess we'll never know. Not until
we take the plunge ourselves, huh?

38:41.152 --> 38:42.569
Doesn't really matter, Dean.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.781
Hope is kind of the whole point.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.244
All right, Haley Joel.

38:52.830 --> 38:53.997
Let's hit the road.
