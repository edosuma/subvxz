WEBVTT

00:13.938 --> 00:16.669
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

00:16.899 --> 00:20.346
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

00:20.611 --> 00:25.492
the queen's justices of oyer and
terminer and general jail delivery

00:25.825 --> 00:29.034
for the jurisdiction of the
Central Criminal Court

00:29.286 --> 00:33.735
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

02:03.214 --> 02:07.139
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping
for a bit of sun for our homecoming.

02:07.426 --> 02:13.308
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate
the sunshine. Is there a draught?

02:13.682 --> 02:18.449
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.

02:18.771 --> 02:22.173
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.

02:22.441 --> 02:24.648
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.

02:24.860 --> 02:30.310
We've been flat on our back for two
months, we'd better be careful.

02:40.543 --> 02:45.629
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely
to live and work in the Inns of Court.

02:45.965 --> 02:48.411
How lucky you lawyers are.

02:49.593 --> 02:53.075
I almost married a lawyer. I was
in attendance for his appendectomy

02:53.347 --> 02:55.953
and we became engaged as
soon as he could sit up.

02:56.183 --> 02:59.107
And then peritonitis set
in and he went like that.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.323
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.

03:14.326 --> 03:18.047
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.378
Oh, shut up!

03:20.583 --> 03:22.551
Williams, my cane.

03:28.883 --> 03:30.851
Here he comes!

03:42.146 --> 03:46.037
Good afternoon. Thank you very
much. Everybody back to work.

03:46.317 --> 03:50.322
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

03:50.613 --> 03:54.618
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

03:54.909 --> 03:57.276
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

03:57.495 --> 04:00.544
Nothing. I'm just happy that
you're your old self again.

04:00.789 --> 04:04.839
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

04:05.127 --> 04:08.574
They won't take him back. He wasn't
really discharged, you know,

04:08.839 --> 04:12.082
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

04:12.343 --> 04:16.791
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

04:22.353 --> 04:26.677
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

04:26.982 --> 04:30.748
But I never knew I could
miss anything so much.

04:31.028 --> 04:34.191
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

04:34.448 --> 04:38.817
I'm not a religious man, but when they
carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.

04:39.119 --> 04:42.760
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.726
If anything happened to you, what
would happen to me, after 37 years?

04:47.002 --> 04:49.972
37 years!
Has it been all that long?

04:50.214 --> 04:55.015
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.

04:55.344 --> 05:00.066
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

05:00.391 --> 05:05.192
My first murder trial. I was more
frightened than the defendant.

05:05.521 --> 05:10.163
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

05:10.484 --> 05:12.452
Right here.

05:13.821 --> 05:17.462
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

05:17.741 --> 05:20.506
I lost 30lbs in that
wretched hospital.

05:20.744 --> 05:24.305
Still, I suppose my
head isn't any smaller.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.505
What's all this?

05:31.714 --> 05:36.117
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

05:36.427 --> 05:39.749
Of course. The solicitors have
been breaking down our doors.

05:40.014 --> 05:43.621
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

05:43.893 --> 05:48.342
Divorce case, a tax appeal, and an
important marine insurance claim.

05:48.647 --> 05:51.856
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

05:52.109 --> 05:56.273
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

05:56.572 --> 06:00.941
Doctors! They've deprived me of
alcohol, tobacco, female companionship.

06:01.243 --> 06:03.769
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

06:03.996 --> 06:04.997
Sorry, sir.

06:05.164 --> 06:08.691
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

06:08.959 --> 06:12.600
- 2:30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!

06:12.880 --> 06:17.010
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs
now, get undressed and lie down.

06:17.301 --> 06:20.908
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.626
Are you aware that,
while on my sickbed,

06:23.849 --> 06:29.060
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

06:29.396 --> 06:35.119
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

06:35.486 --> 06:41.414
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

06:41.784 --> 06:46.631
For four months this alleged angel
of mercy has pored, probed,

06:46.956 --> 06:50.927
punctured, pillaged and
plundered my helpless body

06:51.210 --> 06:55.181
while tormenting my mind with
a steady drip of baby talk.

06:55.464 --> 06:58.035
Come along now,
like a good boy. Oh, no.

06:58.259 --> 07:00.944
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

07:01.178 --> 07:04.466
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

07:04.723 --> 07:08.011
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

07:15.151 --> 07:18.234
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

07:18.487 --> 07:21.650
In hospital he'd hide cigars
and brandy all over the place.

07:21.907 --> 07:24.592
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

07:24.827 --> 07:28.877
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

07:29.165 --> 07:31.452
No. Upstairs.

07:32.668 --> 07:35.433
A few puffs after meals? Please.

07:36.881 --> 07:40.806
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

07:41.093 --> 07:44.859
and plunge it between her shoulder
blades. So help me, I will.

07:45.139 --> 07:51.340
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've
installed something for you here. It's a lift.

07:51.729 --> 07:55.450
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

07:55.733 --> 07:59.658
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

07:59.945 --> 08:04.553
Out of there. I'll try it. It's my
lift because it was my heart attack.

08:04.867 --> 08:08.553
Here you are. Simply press this
button for up and this one for down.

08:08.829 --> 08:11.799
Carter, I warn you, if this
contraption should collapse,

08:12.041 --> 08:16.171
if the barrister should
fall off the bannister...

08:23.761 --> 08:26.332
Remarkable. Smoothest
flight I've had in years.

08:26.555 --> 08:31.277
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.062
Good afternoon. Is it
possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

08:48.285 --> 08:50.970
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

08:51.205 --> 08:55.767
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're
full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.

08:56.085 --> 08:58.167
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

08:58.379 --> 09:00.859
Serious criminal matter.

09:03.092 --> 09:06.301
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

09:06.554 --> 09:09.524
He can't accept anything of
an overstimulating nature.

09:09.765 --> 09:12.848
Put me on a diet of bland
civil suits. Hello, Mayhew.

09:13.102 --> 09:15.582
Hello. Distressing news
about your health.

09:15.813 --> 09:19.340
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

09:19.608 --> 09:23.329
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

09:23.612 --> 09:28.857
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?

09:29.201 --> 09:32.171
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

09:32.413 --> 09:35.019
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

09:35.249 --> 09:38.332
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

09:38.586 --> 09:42.591
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.852
Like a postman bitten
by a stray dog.

09:51.891 --> 09:56.977
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but I
quite understand. Take care of yourself.

09:58.272 --> 10:01.355
Mayhew! Mayhew!

10:01.609 --> 10:04.260
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

10:04.487 --> 10:07.889
Don't worry, we won't take the
brief, but an old friend needs help.

10:08.157 --> 10:10.888
Surely I can give him
a word of advice.

10:11.118 --> 10:14.918
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

10:15.206 --> 10:17.812
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

10:18.042 --> 10:20.648
You go ahead. Start it without me.

10:21.796 --> 10:24.606
This is your fault. You
should not have permitted it.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.447
It is not my fault. I distinctly
told Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

10:28.719 --> 10:31.086
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

10:31.305 --> 10:34.388
Seems silly to me, but Mr
Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

10:34.642 --> 10:38.442
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

10:38.729 --> 10:40.777
Well, for murder.

10:40.981 --> 10:42.471
Oh!

10:42.650 --> 10:46.257
It's the case of Emily French. You've
probably seen reports in the press.

10:46.529 --> 10:50.215
Middle-aged widow, well-off, living
with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

10:50.491 --> 10:52.539
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

10:52.743 --> 10:55.553
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

10:55.788 --> 10:57.995
struck on the back of
the head and killed.

10:58.207 --> 11:01.256
Vole seems caught in a web
of circumstantial evidence.

11:01.502 --> 11:05.223
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

11:05.506 --> 11:08.953
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

11:09.218 --> 11:13.143
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

11:13.430 --> 11:17.560
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

11:17.852 --> 11:21.902
The defence may tum on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

11:22.189 --> 11:26.751
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

11:27.069 --> 11:29.640
This will take all our cunning.

11:34.535 --> 11:36.424
Young man!

11:36.620 --> 11:38.429
Come here, please.

11:38.622 --> 11:42.752
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

11:43.043 --> 11:45.091
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

11:45.296 --> 11:48.266
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

11:51.677 --> 11:54.044
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

11:54.263 --> 11:57.107
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.637
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

12:00.895 --> 12:05.219
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's
face if she saw me now?

12:05.524 --> 12:09.688
Then let's make absolutely
sure that she doesn't.

12:09.987 --> 12:13.878
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

12:14.158 --> 12:16.923
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

12:21.499 --> 12:23.900
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

12:24.126 --> 12:27.767
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.209
I haven't murdered anybody.
It's absurd.

12:30.424 --> 12:34.395
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

12:34.678 --> 12:37.807
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

12:38.057 --> 12:40.537
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

12:40.768 --> 12:42.930
I am a solicitor.
Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

12:43.145 --> 12:46.149
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

12:46.398 --> 12:50.323
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

12:53.489 --> 12:56.299
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

12:56.534 --> 13:00.380
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

13:00.663 --> 13:05.385
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

13:05.709 --> 13:09.475
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

13:09.755 --> 13:13.237
I don't quite know. They asked
if I'd like to make a statement

13:13.509 --> 13:17.753
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

13:18.055 --> 13:20.137
Well, it can't be helped now.

13:20.349 --> 13:24.593
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

13:24.895 --> 13:28.581
He thinks that he made a statement and
that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

13:28.858 --> 13:33.546
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

13:33.863 --> 13:36.104
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

13:36.323 --> 13:40.408
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

13:40.703 --> 13:43.229
We try not to make a habit of it.

13:44.165 --> 13:46.930
But it does happen,
though, doesn't it?

13:47.168 --> 13:51.617
Of course. There was that case of that
fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

13:51.922 --> 13:55.085
In jail for years and they suddenly
found it was another chap.

13:55.342 --> 13:58.824
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

13:59.096 --> 14:03.226
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

14:03.517 --> 14:07.158
That's all right for him. What if it
had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

14:07.438 --> 14:10.521
How would they have restored
him to his normal life then?

14:10.774 --> 14:14.984
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

14:15.279 --> 14:19.170
It's just when you say these things are
closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

14:19.450 --> 14:23.978
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

14:24.288 --> 14:27.735
Let's get this straight. I may have
done something highly unethical.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.482
I've taken your cigar but I'm
not taking your case. I can't.

14:31.754 --> 14:36.681
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.819
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

14:40.054 --> 14:43.740
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

14:44.016 --> 14:49.386
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

14:52.817 --> 14:54.785
Hold this.

14:58.155 --> 14:59.316
Carter?

14:59.490 --> 15:03.256
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.346
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.821
Not even as a nurse during the war.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.682
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

15:13.838 --> 15:17.160
You'll like Brogan-Moore, he's had
excellent training. Under me.

15:17.424 --> 15:21.224
This morning I had no lawyers at
all and now suddenly I have three.

15:21.512 --> 15:24.163
We should explain that I
have very little money.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.631
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

15:26.851 --> 15:29.058
We'll get a fourth
lawyer to sue you.

15:29.270 --> 15:32.274
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

15:32.523 --> 15:35.447
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

15:35.693 --> 15:40.938
My last job was as a mechanic. The
foreman kept riding me all the time.

15:41.282 --> 15:44.491
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?

15:44.743 --> 15:48.873
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

15:49.165 --> 15:53.887
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

15:54.211 --> 15:58.773
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.571
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

16:01.802 --> 16:06.171
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

16:06.474 --> 16:09.080
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

16:09.310 --> 16:13.759
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

16:14.064 --> 16:16.670
But I haven't been much of
a provider, I'm afraid.

16:16.901 --> 16:21.304
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

16:21.614 --> 16:25.539
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

16:26.285 --> 16:31.291
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.673
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

16:34.919 --> 16:37.126
But my best is really
this eggbeater.

16:37.338 --> 16:40.660
It not only beats, it also
separates the yolk from the white.

16:40.925 --> 16:43.246
Is that really desirable?

16:43.469 --> 16:45.915
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

16:46.138 --> 16:49.267
The trouble is, I need money for
manufacturing and promotion.

16:49.517 --> 16:53.408
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

16:53.687 --> 16:58.853
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

16:59.193 --> 17:02.834
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

17:03.113 --> 17:05.844
I was window-shopping
in Oxford Street,

17:06.075 --> 17:10.842
daydreaming about what I'd buy
for her, if I had any money.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.045
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

18:00.254 --> 18:02.700
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

18:02.923 --> 18:07.212
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

18:07.511 --> 18:10.276
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

18:10.514 --> 18:13.802
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

18:14.059 --> 18:18.223
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

18:19.815 --> 18:22.546
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...

18:23.736 --> 18:26.182
You buy that hat. I insist.

18:27.198 --> 18:31.760
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat-
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

18:32.077 --> 18:36.366
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

18:36.665 --> 18:37.951
Go on, please.

18:38.125 --> 18:40.605
I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

18:40.836 --> 18:43.043
I never dreamed I'd see
her again. Or the hat.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.417
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

18:45.633 --> 18:51.083
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.711
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.244
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!

19:20.459 --> 19:23.702
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.125
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.

19:30.094 --> 19:34.577
Thank you. It's such a bother taking
it off and putting it back on again.

19:34.890 --> 19:39.737
That chap is Jesse James. They've led
him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

19:40.062 --> 19:42.463
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

19:42.690 --> 19:45.375
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

19:45.609 --> 19:50.740
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

19:51.073 --> 19:55.123
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.937
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.054
At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

20:01.292 --> 20:04.341
No. Absolutely not. We were
sitting in the cheap seats.

20:04.587 --> 20:08.273
All I knew was she seemed to be very
lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

20:08.549 --> 20:11.234
She and her husband lived
abroad in British Nigeria.

20:11.469 --> 20:15.872
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

20:16.182 --> 20:19.345
Please, Mayhew, not when
I'm smoking. Go on, young man.

20:19.602 --> 20:22.685
Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

20:22.938 --> 20:26.260
and after we left the movie she
invited me to her house for tea.

20:30.321 --> 20:34.121
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.

20:34.408 --> 20:36.376
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

20:36.577 --> 20:39.547
But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

20:39.788 --> 20:42.712
It must be cen-trifugal or
centrifugal, which is it?

20:42.958 --> 20:45.484
It's specific gravity,
but it whips cream too.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.715
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

20:48.964 --> 20:51.365
We must have one. Is it expensive?

20:51.592 --> 20:54.914
Compliments of the inventor,
manufacturer and sole distributor.

20:55.179 --> 20:59.025
Thank you. We'll use it constantly,
won't we, Janet?

20:59.308 --> 21:03.757
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.

21:10.778 --> 21:12.348
Ha!

21:14.406 --> 21:17.535
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?

21:17.785 --> 21:19.753
Why not?

21:19.954 --> 21:22.525
This is a charming room.

21:22.748 --> 21:26.878
Hubert and I collected all these
things when we lived in Africa.

21:27.169 --> 21:29.331
Hubert was my husband.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.157
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

21:33.384 --> 21:35.785
That's the mask of
the witch doctor.

21:36.011 --> 21:38.412
He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

21:38.639 --> 21:42.246
So Hubert used to call
him a witch dentist.

21:43.352 --> 21:46.561
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.

21:46.814 --> 21:48.942
Oh, here's tea.

21:51.443 --> 21:56.005
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

21:56.323 --> 21:59.213
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

21:59.451 --> 22:01.818
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

22:02.037 --> 22:04.005
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

22:04.206 --> 22:08.370
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

22:08.669 --> 22:13.470
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

22:13.799 --> 22:18.487
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

22:18.804 --> 22:22.206
Oh, is she? I thought she
came with the collection.

22:23.434 --> 22:27.234
You know, maybe I'll take
a glass of sherry myself.

22:27.521 --> 22:30.206
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

22:31.525 --> 22:36.008
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

22:36.322 --> 22:39.246
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

22:39.492 --> 22:41.620
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

22:41.827 --> 22:45.991
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

22:46.290 --> 22:50.659
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

22:50.961 --> 22:52.929
and unsanitary.

22:55.591 --> 22:58.197
Tell Sir Wilfrid about the
evening of the murder.

22:59.053 --> 23:01.579
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

23:01.806 --> 23:04.650
She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to The Mikado.

23:04.892 --> 23:08.817
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

23:09.104 --> 23:13.075
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out
of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

23:13.359 --> 23:15.930
How much money did you
get from Mrs French?

23:16.153 --> 23:18.155
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

23:18.364 --> 23:21.971
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

23:22.243 --> 23:24.211
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

23:24.411 --> 23:27.335
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

23:27.581 --> 23:30.232
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

23:30.459 --> 23:33.668
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

23:33.921 --> 23:35.685
- Because...
- Because what?

23:35.881 --> 23:39.328
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

23:39.593 --> 23:41.914
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

23:42.138 --> 23:45.938
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

23:46.225 --> 23:49.513
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

23:49.770 --> 23:53.013
Because she was rich, and
you were after her money.

23:53.274 --> 23:55.276
Well, yes, in a way.

23:55.985 --> 24:00.627
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

24:00.948 --> 24:04.111
An honest business proposition,
that's all. Is that so wicked?

24:04.368 --> 24:06.450
You knew it was the
housekeeper's day off?

24:06.662 --> 24:09.268
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

24:09.498 --> 24:11.944
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

24:12.168 --> 24:15.809
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

24:16.088 --> 24:18.853
with a gramophone
blaring The Mikado.

24:19.091 --> 24:21.662
Perhaps you turned up the
volume to drown her cries.

24:21.886 --> 24:26.335
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

24:26.640 --> 24:30.440
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

24:30.728 --> 24:33.937
I didn't do it. No matter how bad
things look, I didn't do it!

24:34.190 --> 24:38.354
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

24:39.528 --> 24:41.576
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

24:41.780 --> 24:45.148
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

24:45.409 --> 24:47.616
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

24:47.828 --> 24:51.594
As for things looking bad, they don't
look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

24:51.874 --> 24:56.038
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

24:56.337 --> 24:59.546
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.723
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

25:02.968 --> 25:07.929
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

25:08.265 --> 25:10.916
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

25:11.143 --> 25:13.384
Very much. We're
devoted to each other.

25:13.604 --> 25:18.644
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.635
People might think Christine
would lie on my account?

25:21.862 --> 25:25.662
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

25:27.034 --> 25:31.642
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

25:31.956 --> 25:36.644
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

25:36.961 --> 25:39.646
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

25:39.880 --> 25:42.167
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

25:42.383 --> 25:44.670
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.

25:44.885 --> 25:48.776
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

25:49.056 --> 25:51.297
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

25:51.517 --> 25:54.521
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

25:54.770 --> 25:57.774
You will agree that we can rule
out a crime of passion, hm?

25:58.023 --> 26:00.708
That leaves us with a
murder for profit.

26:00.943 --> 26:04.914
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

26:05.197 --> 26:09.646
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

26:09.952 --> 26:12.876
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

26:14.540 --> 26:19.341
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.

26:19.670 --> 26:23.880
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

26:24.175 --> 26:27.418
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

26:27.678 --> 26:31.364
Oh, we'll simply put a
lean on Mr Vole's £80,000.

26:31.640 --> 26:35.884
- What £80,000?
- The £80,000 Mrs French left you.

26:36.187 --> 26:37.313
Left me?

26:37.480 --> 26:42.441
They opened Mrs French's bank
vault today and found her will.

26:43.486 --> 26:47.650
- Congratulations.
- £80,000!

26:47.948 --> 26:51.395
And I was worried about a couple of
hundred for that silly eggbeater.

26:51.660 --> 26:53.628
I must call Christine.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.237
Oh.

26:59.418 --> 27:02.308
This doesn't make things look
any better for me, does it?

27:02.546 --> 27:05.868
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

27:06.133 --> 27:11.458
They will indeed. £80,000 makes
for a very handsome motive.

27:11.806 --> 27:14.377
I thought you were crazy but
now they will arrest me!

27:14.600 --> 27:16.568
It's not unlikely.

27:23.984 --> 27:27.272
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

27:27.530 --> 27:31.899
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

27:32.201 --> 27:36.445
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

27:36.747 --> 27:41.116
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.

27:41.418 --> 27:44.945
Chief Inspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

27:45.214 --> 27:47.785
You're getting the
deluxe treatment.

27:48.008 --> 27:53.174
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

27:53.514 --> 27:57.121
That's perfectly all right. I never
object to the actions of the police

27:57.393 --> 28:01.079
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

28:01.355 --> 28:03.722
You know Mr Mayhew,
Mr Brogan-Moore.

28:03.941 --> 28:08.344
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

28:08.654 --> 28:11.225
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

28:11.448 --> 28:16.932
I have a warrant for your arrest on
the charge of murdering Emily French.

28:17.288 --> 28:22.089
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

28:22.418 --> 28:25.262
Well, I'm ready.
Must I be handcuffed?

28:25.504 --> 28:27.905
That won't be necessary, sir.

28:28.132 --> 28:31.534
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

28:31.802 --> 28:35.488
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

28:35.764 --> 28:40.930
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

28:45.608 --> 28:49.454
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

28:49.737 --> 28:51.865
I'll go too, see you're
properly charged.

28:52.072 --> 28:54.882
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.

28:55.117 --> 28:58.758
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

28:59.997 --> 29:04.764
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.

29:06.587 --> 29:08.555
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

29:12.927 --> 29:16.773
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.024
Good day, sir.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.267
Makes a very nice
impression, doesn't he?

29:23.479 --> 29:27.609
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.302
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

29:31.570 --> 29:35.256
Of course. The prosecution will blast
in with their heaviest artillery.

29:35.533 --> 29:39.902
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

29:40.204 --> 29:42.206
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

29:42.414 --> 29:46.260
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

29:47.294 --> 29:52.255
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.834
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

29:56.095 --> 29:59.099
Either you take care of yourself
or I, too, shall resign.

29:59.348 --> 30:01.828
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

30:02.059 --> 30:06.030
For my first day this has already been
rather hectic. I should be in bed.

30:10.234 --> 30:14.000
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

30:14.280 --> 30:20.242
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

30:21.495 --> 30:26.535
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

30:26.876 --> 30:29.038
Take me, I'm yours.

30:31.297 --> 30:31.866
Oh!

30:32.006 --> 30:36.409
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

30:36.719 --> 30:41.281
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

30:41.599 --> 30:45.604
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

30:45.895 --> 30:49.297
I do not think that
will be necessary.

30:52.485 --> 30:54.965
I never faint in case
I don't fall gracefully,

30:55.196 --> 30:58.882
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.559
I'm Christine Vole.

31:01.785 --> 31:04.311
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

31:04.538 --> 31:06.506
How do you do?

31:06.707 --> 31:09.631
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

31:09.877 --> 31:12.687
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

31:12.922 --> 31:17.723
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

31:18.052 --> 31:21.499
Leonard has been arrested and
charged with murder. Is that it?

31:21.764 --> 31:25.086
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.877
I'm glad you're showing
such fortitude.

31:28.103 --> 31:31.073
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

31:31.774 --> 31:34.300
Your husband will have to
stand trial, I'm afraid.

31:34.527 --> 31:39.533
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.196
Oh?

31:41.367 --> 31:44.098
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

31:44.328 --> 31:46.808
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

31:47.039 --> 31:52.284
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause.

31:55.673 --> 31:59.473
Is it, perhaps, that this
cause is too hopeless?

32:06.684 --> 32:11.485
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison.
It was a mistake to let you come back here.

32:11.814 --> 32:14.340
I should have taken you to
a rest-home or a resort.

32:14.567 --> 32:16.934
Some place quiet,
far off, like Bermuda.

32:17.153 --> 32:19.997
Shut up. You just want to see
me in those nasty shorts.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.402
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

32:23.659 --> 32:27.505
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

32:28.539 --> 32:33.784
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

32:34.128 --> 32:37.052
After your rest we'll
have a nice cup of cocoa.

32:37.298 --> 32:40.268
Then perhaps we'll have a
walk around the square.

32:40.509 --> 32:43.080
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

32:43.304 --> 32:47.673
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

32:47.975 --> 32:52.458
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

32:52.771 --> 32:57.174
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

32:57.485 --> 33:01.251
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

33:01.530 --> 33:03.851
All right. Hop in!

33:05.034 --> 33:07.355
Sir Wilfrid?

33:10.247 --> 33:11.931
Sir Wilfrid!

33:12.124 --> 33:13.853
Come back!

33:14.293 --> 33:18.855
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

33:19.173 --> 33:20.299
Go on.

33:20.466 --> 33:24.073
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

33:24.345 --> 33:27.428
That's quite natural. I'm sure
a jury will find it endearing.

33:27.681 --> 33:31.527
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

33:31.811 --> 33:33.893
and the socks were
two sizes too large,

33:34.104 --> 33:36.710
but he wore them just the
same to give her pleasure.

33:36.941 --> 33:38.909
Leonard has a way with women.

33:39.109 --> 33:44.673
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

33:45.032 --> 33:49.879
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

33:50.204 --> 33:52.206
Yes. A lot of money.

33:52.414 --> 33:57.102
Of course, your husband had no
previous knowledge of this bequest?

33:57.419 --> 33:59.581
Is that what he told you?

33:59.797 --> 34:02.198
Surely you're not
suggesting different?

34:02.424 --> 34:06.315
Oh, no, no. I do not
suggest anything.

34:06.595 --> 34:12.237
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

34:13.101 --> 34:16.788
You think Mrs French looked upon
Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

34:17.063 --> 34:20.591
I do. An entirely natural and
understandable relationship.

34:20.860 --> 34:24.103
What hypocrites you
are in this country.

34:26.031 --> 34:28.318
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

34:28.534 --> 34:32.983
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

34:33.289 --> 34:37.179
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

34:37.460 --> 34:40.748
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

34:41.005 --> 34:44.976
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

34:45.259 --> 34:47.989
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

34:48.219 --> 34:51.906
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

34:52.183 --> 34:54.754
I assume you want to
help your husband?

34:54.976 --> 35:00.427
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

35:00.774 --> 35:04.745
There. Isn't that more
comfortable for you?

35:05.529 --> 35:08.692
Now, Mrs Vole.
This is very important.

35:08.949 --> 35:12.715
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9:30. Correct?

35:12.995 --> 35:16.283
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

35:16.540 --> 35:18.429
Isn't it the truth?

35:18.626 --> 35:20.435
Of course.

35:20.628 --> 35:23.438
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

35:23.672 --> 35:26.755
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

35:27.009 --> 35:29.216
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

35:29.428 --> 35:32.591
we accept the evidence of witnesses
who speak only Bulgarian

35:32.848 --> 35:35.374
and who must have an interpreter.

35:35.601 --> 35:38.764
We accept the evidence of
deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

35:39.021 --> 35:41.308
as long as they tell the truth.

35:41.524 --> 35:44.767
You're aware that when you're in
the witness box you will be sworn

35:45.027 --> 35:47.997
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

35:48.239 --> 35:51.960
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

35:52.243 --> 35:57.204
The truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. Is that better?

35:58.916 --> 36:03.877
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

36:04.213 --> 36:07.820
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

36:08.092 --> 36:11.301
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

36:11.554 --> 36:15.445
you cannot be called to give
testimony damaging to your husband?

36:15.724 --> 36:17.852
How very convenient.

36:18.060 --> 36:20.142
We are dealing with
a capital crime.

36:20.354 --> 36:23.995
The prosecution will try
to hang your husband.

36:25.234 --> 36:27.805
He is not my husband.

36:34.243 --> 36:36.644
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

36:36.871 --> 36:40.637
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

36:40.916 --> 36:44.716
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

36:45.004 --> 36:48.975
He would not have married me and I'd
have been left to starve in the rubble.

36:49.258 --> 36:51.784
But he did marry you and
brought you safely here.

36:52.011 --> 36:54.218
Don't you think you
should be grateful?

36:54.430 --> 36:56.478
One can get very
tired of gratitude.

36:56.682 --> 36:59.288
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

36:59.518 --> 37:02.681
Leonard? He worships
the ground I walk on.

37:02.938 --> 37:05.066
And you?

37:05.274 --> 37:07.561
You want to know too much.

37:07.776 --> 37:10.143
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.

37:11.322 --> 37:16.533
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

37:16.869 --> 37:21.397
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

37:21.707 --> 37:26.508
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."

37:26.837 --> 37:30.558
You're a very remarkable
woman, Mrs Vole.

37:31.801 --> 37:34.168
And you're satisfied, I hope?

37:35.596 --> 37:41.000
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

37:41.352 --> 37:43.798
That woman's up to something.
But what?

37:44.021 --> 37:47.912
The prosecution will break her down in
no time when she's in the witness box.

37:48.192 --> 37:51.560
This case is going to be rather like
the charge of the Light Brigade

37:51.821 --> 37:55.462
or one of those Japanese
suicide pilots. Quite one-sided.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.062
With the odds all
on the other side.

37:58.285 --> 38:00.731
I haven't got much
to go on, have I?

38:00.955 --> 38:03.435
The fact is, I've got nothing.

38:04.625 --> 38:06.753
Let me ask you something.

38:06.961 --> 38:10.329
Do you believe Leonard
Vole is innocent?

38:13.425 --> 38:15.393
Do you?

38:16.846 --> 38:19.167
Do you?

38:19.390 --> 38:21.358
I'm not sure.

38:21.559 --> 38:25.006
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

38:25.271 --> 38:27.956
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

38:28.190 --> 38:30.761
I'll take it from here.

38:32.153 --> 38:37.000
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

38:37.324 --> 38:39.691
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

38:39.910 --> 38:42.834
Did you hear me? A match!

39:14.737 --> 39:20.506
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

39:20.868 --> 39:26.034
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

39:26.373 --> 39:28.899
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

39:29.126 --> 39:31.288
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

39:31.504 --> 39:33.472
This is what you were
wearing that night.

39:33.672 --> 39:37.438
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

39:37.718 --> 39:40.085
Over here against the wall, please.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.446
Hold it. One more
in profile, please.

39:45.684 --> 39:49.086
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

39:49.355 --> 39:51.961
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

39:52.191 --> 39:54.956
Yes, of course, Christine
is an interested witness.

39:55.194 --> 39:57.401
I'll pick up the negatives later.
Thank you.

39:57.613 --> 40:01.584
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

40:02.910 --> 40:06.312
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

40:06.580 --> 40:09.106
Mayhew, give me the reports.

40:09.333 --> 40:12.382
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

40:12.628 --> 40:17.555
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

40:21.804 --> 40:25.251
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

40:25.516 --> 40:27.564
particularly her
income tax returns."

40:27.768 --> 40:30.578
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those
forms are very complicated.

40:30.813 --> 40:33.976
There's also a hint you may have
helped her draft her new will.

40:34.233 --> 40:37.123
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

40:37.361 --> 40:39.967
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

40:40.197 --> 40:46.159
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

40:46.537 --> 40:50.144
Now, this cut in your wrist. You
say you cut yourself with a knife?

40:50.416 --> 40:53.977
Well, that's true, I did. I was
cutting bread and the knife slipped.

40:54.253 --> 41:00.704
But that was two days after. Christine
was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

41:02.219 --> 41:06.224
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

41:06.515 --> 41:10.406
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

41:10.686 --> 41:14.054
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

41:14.315 --> 41:17.205
Yes, it must be hard. We've
never been separated before.

41:17.443 --> 41:21.607
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

41:21.906 --> 41:23.874
In Germany in 1945.

41:25.075 --> 41:30.525
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

41:30.873 --> 41:34.480
I was stationed outside Hamburg,
with an RAF maintenance unit.

41:34.752 --> 41:40.077
I'd just installed a shower in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.

41:43.719 --> 41:44.686

Hey, Fräulein, show us some legs.

43:01.547 --> 43:05.518
They rob you blind and then
throw you a ruddy sailor!

43:05.801 --> 43:09.203
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!

43:10.097 --> 43:13.180
Come help the cabaret
out of her trousers!

43:13.434 --> 43:16.643
All right, Fräulein, if you
won't show 'em, I will.

43:43.631 --> 43:47.795
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

44:01.732 --> 44:02.779
Come on.

44:04.693 --> 44:07.458
Bring him round to the other truck.

44:11.659 --> 44:14.583
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!

44:52.116 --> 44:54.084
Gesundheit.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.651
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.

45:03.878 --> 45:05.880
Oh, let me help you.

45:09.216 --> 45:13.062
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.

45:14.930 --> 45:17.251
I'm terribly sorry.

45:17.475 --> 45:19.682
You better go. We've
had trouble enough.

45:19.894 --> 45:23.785
Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

45:24.064 --> 45:28.274
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

45:28.569 --> 45:31.971
Then raid by raid, my other dresses,
and now you've bombed my trousers.

45:32.239 --> 45:34.207
Cigarette? Gum?

45:43.250 --> 45:45.457
You're burning my nose.

45:45.669 --> 45:48.070
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

45:48.297 --> 45:50.743
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.

45:50.966 --> 45:52.456
How much?

45:52.635 --> 45:54.717
I don't know. What's
the rate of exchange?

45:54.929 --> 45:58.729
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

45:59.016 --> 46:00.984
Got any hot water at your place?

46:01.185 --> 46:04.473
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

46:04.730 --> 46:06.300
Nearby.

46:07.233 --> 46:08.997
Come.

46:15.449 --> 46:17.497
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

46:17.701 --> 46:21.183
This is pretty horrible.
In a gemütlich sort of way.

46:21.455 --> 46:24.902
Oh, it's fine now. I used to
have a roommate. A dancer.

46:25.167 --> 46:28.410
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

46:28.671 --> 46:31.322
She has a Ford automobile.

46:31.549 --> 46:34.519
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

46:34.760 --> 46:37.889
That's all right,
I've got a weekend pass.

46:38.139 --> 46:41.621
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

46:41.892 --> 46:44.179
You'd better sit down on the cot.

46:44.395 --> 46:46.045
The cot?

46:46.230 --> 46:49.632
Getting more gemütlich all
the time. Are you married?

46:49.900 --> 46:51.743
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

46:51.944 --> 46:54.470
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

46:54.697 --> 46:58.463
I just wear it when I'm working. Gives
a little protection with all the men.

46:58.742 --> 47:03.304
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

47:03.622 --> 47:05.784
But it's getting better.

47:09.587 --> 47:12.636
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.

47:12.882 --> 47:18.844
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

47:35.821 --> 47:38.222
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

47:38.449 --> 47:40.417
Very fair.

47:41.410 --> 47:45.540
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

47:45.831 --> 47:47.799
I would.

47:56.884 --> 48:00.684
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.

48:00.971 --> 48:02.655
Milk?

48:02.848 --> 48:04.612
Sure.

48:06.435 --> 48:08.597
Milk. Sugar.

48:09.855 --> 48:12.176
It's a pleasure to do
business with you.

48:12.399 --> 48:14.163
Yeah.

48:19.323 --> 48:23.169
I also carry biscuits,
powdered eggs,

48:23.452 --> 48:27.821
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.

48:28.124 --> 48:32.095
Don't worry, we'll work out
something, like an instalment plan.

48:32.378 --> 48:35.746
<i>♪ I may never go home any more</i>

48:42.012 --> 48:44.902
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.

48:45.141 --> 48:48.907
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.

48:49.186 --> 48:50.472
Ooh.

48:50.646 --> 48:53.616
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.

48:53.858 --> 48:56.065
Maybe I can fix it.

48:56.277 --> 48:58.245
I'm good at it.

49:04.452 --> 49:07.262
I had a weekend pass,
a month's pay in my pocket.

49:07.496 --> 49:11.182
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.

49:11.459 --> 49:14.622
We got married. When I got out
of the service I brought her here.

49:14.879 --> 49:18.600
It was wonderful. I rented
a little flat, Edgware Road.

49:18.883 --> 49:22.251
First time she saw it, she was so
happy she broke down and cried.

49:22.511 --> 49:27.039
Naturally. She had a solid roof over
her head and a British passport.

49:27.349 --> 49:32.719
You don't know her, how she feels about
me. You will when she gives evidence.

49:33.063 --> 49:37.785
Mr Vole, I must tell you I am not
putting her in the witness box.

49:38.944 --> 49:40.867
You're not? Why not?

49:41.071 --> 49:44.678
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar with
the subtleties of our language.

49:44.950 --> 49:47.271
The prosecution could
easily trip her up.

49:47.495 --> 49:50.499
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the
crown. We can't take chances.

49:50.748 --> 49:54.798
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll
is waiting in the car with her pills

49:55.085 --> 49:58.453
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.

49:58.714 --> 50:03.197
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.

50:03.511 --> 50:08.153
For no other reason than I'm a mean,
ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.

50:08.474 --> 50:11.045
Let us wish each other luck.

50:16.482 --> 50:22.046
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.

50:23.614 --> 50:26.982
Touching, isn't it? The way
he counts on his wife.

50:27.243 --> 50:32.010
Yes. Like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade.

50:47.555 --> 50:52.721
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are
charged on indictment for that you,

50:53.060 --> 50:57.031
on the 14th day of October,
in the county of London,

50:57.314 --> 51:00.124
murdered Emily Jane French.

51:00.359 --> 51:02.965
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?

51:03.195 --> 51:06.165
Are you guilty or not guilty?

51:08.451 --> 51:09.862
Not guilty.

51:11.871 --> 51:13.919
Members of the jury,

51:14.123 --> 51:18.731
the prisoner stands indicted for
that he, on the 14th day of October,

51:19.044 --> 51:21.809
murdered Emily Jane French.

51:22.047 --> 51:25.654
To this indictment he
has pleaded not guilty.

51:25.926 --> 51:29.567
And it is your charge to say,
having heard the evidence,

51:29.847 --> 51:32.737
whether he be guilty or not.

51:37.104 --> 51:40.347
Members of the jury, by the
oath which you have just taken,

51:40.608 --> 51:44.010
you have sworn to try this
case on the evidence.

51:44.278 --> 51:46.804
You must shut out from
your minds everything

51:47.031 --> 51:50.478
except what will take
place in this court.

51:50.743 --> 51:54.145
You may proceed for the
prosecution, Mr Myers.

51:54.413 --> 51:57.815
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

51:58.083 --> 52:02.645
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

52:02.963 --> 52:06.729
And my learned friends Sir Wilfrid
Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

52:07.009 --> 52:08.977
appear for the defence.

52:13.057 --> 52:15.298
I trust we are not to be deprived

52:15.518 --> 52:18.328
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

52:18.562 --> 52:22.726
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

52:23.025 --> 52:26.108
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

52:26.362 --> 52:31.323
My lord, may I express my regret that Sir
Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

52:31.659 --> 52:36.870
You may, Mr Myers. You may also proceed
with the case for the prosecution.

52:37.206 --> 52:39.368
Thank you, my lord.

52:39.583 --> 52:43.383
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

52:43.671 --> 52:47.642
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

52:47.925 --> 52:49.450
a woman of 56.

52:49.635 --> 52:53.879
How he was treated by her with
kindness and even affection.

52:54.181 --> 52:56.661
On the night of October 14 last,

52:56.892 --> 53:00.738
between 9:30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

53:01.981 --> 53:04.427
Medical testimony will
be introduced to prove

53:04.650 --> 53:07.859
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

53:08.112 --> 53:10.638
and it is the case
for the prosecution

53:10.865 --> 53:13.948
that the blow was dealt by
the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

53:14.201 --> 53:16.169
That's not true! I didn't do it!

53:18.914 --> 53:21.565
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

53:21.792 --> 53:25.478
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

53:25.754 --> 53:28.439
and from the medical and
laboratory experts,

53:28.674 --> 53:34.124
and the evidence of the murdered woman's
solicitor, who drew her final will.

53:34.472 --> 53:38.113
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,

53:38.392 --> 53:41.123
- New Scotland Yard.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

53:41.353 --> 53:44.323
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

54:02.374 --> 54:06.857
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

54:07.171 --> 54:09.742
240 above 130. You
shouldn't be here at all.

54:09.965 --> 54:12.969
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

54:13.219 --> 54:15.540
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

54:15.763 --> 54:19.449
It may interest you to know that I
am descended from a warrior family

54:19.725 --> 54:24.891
which traces its brave past back
to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

54:27.483 --> 54:29.611
You're to have a calcium
injection daily,

54:29.819 --> 54:33.540
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

54:33.823 --> 54:37.669
Any pain or shortness of breath, pop
one of these nitroglycerin tablets

54:37.952 --> 54:40.603
under your tongue. Oh, and
I'll leave you some...

54:40.830 --> 54:44.915
That's enough, Doctor. The judge
will be asking for a saliva test.

54:45.209 --> 54:49.612
Carter, I'd better take that
Thermos of cocoa with me.

54:49.922 --> 54:52.653
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

54:52.883 --> 54:58.049
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

54:58.389 --> 55:00.835
It is cocoa. So sorry.

55:01.058 --> 55:03.982
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

55:04.228 --> 55:06.799
Take care of this, Carter.

55:08.566 --> 55:12.093
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

55:12.361 --> 55:13.726
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

55:13.904 --> 55:16.510
Watch your temper. Keep
your blood pressure down.

55:16.740 --> 55:21.109
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

55:21.412 --> 55:23.380
Come along, Carter.

55:24.623 --> 55:27.513
From the body temperature
and other factors,

55:27.751 --> 55:31.358
we placed the time of death
at between 9:30 and 10pm,

55:31.630 --> 55:36.921
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

55:37.761 --> 55:43.165
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

55:43.517 --> 55:45.599
Were there any signs of a struggle?

55:45.811 --> 55:48.052
None. Just the one blow.

55:48.272 --> 55:52.072
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

55:52.359 --> 55:55.522
My lord, I must object.

55:56.489 --> 56:00.016
My learned friend refers to the
assailant as "the murderer".

56:00.284 --> 56:03.731
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

56:03.996 --> 56:06.840
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

56:07.082 --> 56:12.805
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

56:13.172 --> 56:15.254
Please rephrase your question.

56:15.466 --> 56:21.269
Yes, my lord. Inspector, is it
your opinion that the assailant,

56:21.639 --> 56:25.644
whether he, she or it, had
taken Mrs French by surprise?

56:25.935 --> 56:28.063
My lord, I am taken by surprise

56:28.270 --> 56:32.958
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion, not a fact.

56:33.275 --> 56:36.085
Quite so. You'll have to do
better than that, Mr Myers.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.561
My lord, I withdraw the
question entirely.

56:38.781 --> 56:41.352
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

56:47.289 --> 56:49.098
Silence! Silence!

56:52.461 --> 56:55.271
Very well, Inspector, let
us proceed with the facts.

56:55.506 --> 56:59.750
After establishing the cause and the
time of death, what did you then do?

57:00.052 --> 57:03.738
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

57:04.014 --> 57:08.019
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

57:08.310 --> 57:12.599
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

57:12.898 --> 57:15.026
- No others?
- No others.

57:15.234 --> 57:19.842
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

57:20.156 --> 57:25.322
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

57:25.661 --> 57:29.507
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

57:29.790 --> 57:35.035
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

57:35.379 --> 57:41.830
You're saying that someone made it look as
if it had been forced from the outside?

57:42.219 --> 57:46.429
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

57:46.724 --> 57:49.534
After all, if he insists on
answering his own questions,

57:49.768 --> 57:53.056
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

57:53.314 --> 57:55.681
Quite. Don't you
think so, Mr Myers?

57:55.900 --> 57:57.868
Yes, my lord.

57:59.069 --> 58:00.434
Inspector,

58:00.613 --> 58:04.095
did you ascertain if any of the
murdered woman's property was missing?

58:04.366 --> 58:07.336
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

58:07.578 --> 58:12.982
In your experience, Inspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

58:13.334 --> 58:17.100
break into a house, do they
leave without taking anything?

58:17.379 --> 58:18.460
No, sir.

58:18.631 --> 58:21.441
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.

58:21.675 --> 58:23.837
Is that the jacket?

58:27.139 --> 58:30.825
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

58:31.101 --> 58:33.069
Where did you find this, Inspector?

58:33.270 --> 58:35.750
That is the jacket found
in the prisoner's flat,

58:35.981 --> 58:38.382
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

58:38.609 --> 58:40.976
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

58:41.195 --> 58:43.675
Though an attempt had been
made to wash them out.

58:43.906 --> 58:45.715
What tests were made?

58:45.908 --> 58:49.958
First to determine if the
stains were human blood,

58:50.246 --> 58:52.567
then to classify it
by group or type.

58:52.790 --> 58:55.361
And was the blood of a
particular group or type?

58:55.584 --> 58:58.394
Yes, sir. It is type O.

58:58.629 --> 59:01.792
And did you subsequently test
the blood of the dead woman?

59:02.049 --> 59:04.290
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

59:05.803 --> 59:08.124
The same. Type O.

59:08.347 --> 59:11.988
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

59:12.268 --> 59:17.115
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

59:17.439 --> 59:19.760
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

59:19.984 --> 59:24.751
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

59:25.072 --> 59:27.359
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

59:27.575 --> 59:29.816
So the absence of
fingerprints in a robbery

59:30.035 --> 59:32.163
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

59:32.371 --> 59:36.217
Can't we surmise the burglar might
have entered a presumably empty house,

59:36.500 --> 59:39.106
suddenly encountered Mrs
French and struck her,

59:39.336 --> 59:42.545
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

59:42.798 --> 59:45.278
I submit, my lord, that
it is entirely impossible

59:45.509 --> 59:49.912
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

59:50.222 --> 59:52.384
With or without gloves.

59:52.600 --> 59:56.366
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

59:58.856 --> 01:00:02.941
Inspector, when you questioned the
prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

01:00:03.235 --> 01:00:07.126
did he not show you a
recently-healed scar on his wrist,

01:00:07.406 --> 01:00:11.968
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

01:00:12.286 --> 01:00:14.937
And were you not told the
same thing by his wife?

01:00:15.164 --> 01:00:18.885
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

01:00:19.168 --> 01:00:21.455
Did the prisoner's
wife show you a knife

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:25.561
and tell you that her husband had
cut his wrist while slicing bread?

01:00:25.841 --> 01:00:30.290
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

01:00:34.683 --> 01:00:38.210
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

01:00:38.479 --> 01:00:42.325
You agree that the point and the
cutting edge are razor-sharp?

01:00:42.608 --> 01:00:44.975
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

01:00:45.194 --> 01:00:48.118
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

01:00:48.364 --> 01:00:49.525
Yes, sir, it might.

01:00:49.698 --> 01:00:54.625
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

01:00:54.954 --> 01:00:59.721
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

01:01:00.042 --> 01:01:02.409
- That is correct.
- However,

01:01:02.628 --> 01:01:05.950
if the prisoner's blood were
also of this same group,

01:01:06.215 --> 01:01:08.821
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:11.657
from the household accident
he described to you.

01:01:11.887 --> 01:01:14.208
Yes, sir.

01:01:14.431 --> 01:01:18.072
Did you examine the
prisoner's blood, Inspector?

01:01:18.352 --> 01:01:19.842
No, sir.

01:01:21.605 --> 01:01:24.370
I have here a certificate

01:01:24.608 --> 01:01:28.738
stating that Leonard Stephen
Vole is a blood donor

01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:31.236
at the North London Hospital.

01:01:31.449 --> 01:01:34.737
And that his blood is group O.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.907
Thank you, Inspector.

01:01:44.962 --> 01:01:49.490
Inspector, granted that the cut on
the wrist was caused by that knife,

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.770
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

01:01:53.012 --> 01:01:56.937
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

01:01:57.224 --> 01:01:59.909
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

01:02:00.144 --> 01:02:01.509
You may stand down.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.330
- Call Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

01:02:07.568 --> 01:02:10.333
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

01:02:33.761 --> 01:02:36.446
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence...

01:02:39.058 --> 01:02:42.301
...the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

01:02:42.561 --> 01:02:45.644
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.

01:02:45.898 --> 01:02:49.266
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

01:02:49.527 --> 01:02:54.328
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

01:02:54.657 --> 01:02:58.981
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

01:02:59.286 --> 01:03:02.893
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

01:03:03.165 --> 01:03:06.294
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

01:03:06.544 --> 01:03:09.593
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:13.002
poor feckless bodies, afraid of
a bit of honest domestic work.

01:03:13.259 --> 01:03:18.265
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

01:03:18.597 --> 01:03:21.601
Aye. Ten years I was with
her and looked after her.

01:03:21.851 --> 01:03:24.422
She knew me and she trusted me.

01:03:24.645 --> 01:03:27.410
Many's the time I prevented
her doing a foolish thing.

01:03:27.648 --> 01:03:32.336
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

01:03:33.237 --> 01:03:37.128
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

01:03:37.408 --> 01:03:41.697
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

01:03:41.996 --> 01:03:46.081
I promised to take her a dress
pattern that she admired.

01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:49.857
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

01:03:50.129 --> 01:03:54.373
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

01:03:54.675 --> 01:03:58.202
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

01:03:58.471 --> 01:04:02.112
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

01:04:02.391 --> 01:04:05.679
So after supper I slipped back
to get it as it was no distance.

01:04:05.936 --> 01:04:09.099
I got back to the
house at 25 past 9.

01:04:09.356 --> 01:04:11.597
I let myself in and went
upstairs to my room.

01:04:11.817 --> 01:04:16.823
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

01:04:17.156 --> 01:04:21.127
No, it wasn't me!
It wasn't my voice!

01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:23.378
Talking and laughing they were.

01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:26.981
But it was no business of mine, so I
went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

01:04:27.249 --> 01:04:30.537
Now, let us be very
exact as to the time.

01:04:30.795 --> 01:04:34.561
You say that you re-entered
the house at 25 past 9?

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.084
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

01:04:39.386 --> 01:04:43.675
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

01:04:43.974 --> 01:04:49.743
I went back to my niece. Och, she was
delighted with the pattern. Si...

01:04:51.857 --> 01:04:57.944
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,
then I said good night and I come home.

01:04:58.322 --> 01:05:01.963
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

01:05:02.243 --> 01:05:04.211
before she went to bed.

01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:08.780
And there she was, dead. And
everything tossed hither and thither.

01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:11.893
Did you really think that a
burglary had been committed?

01:05:12.128 --> 01:05:14.096
My lord, I must protest!

01:05:14.296 --> 01:05:18.301
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

01:05:18.592 --> 01:05:22.358
Miss McKenzie, were you aware that
Leonard Vole was a married man?

01:05:22.638 --> 01:05:25.403
No, indeed. And neither
was the mistress.

01:05:25.641 --> 01:05:27.609
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:32.577
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

01:05:34.275 --> 01:05:36.562
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

01:05:36.777 --> 01:05:40.145
that Mrs French thought Leonard
Vole was a single man?

01:05:40.406 --> 01:05:43.774
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

01:05:44.034 --> 01:05:48.722
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

01:05:49.039 --> 01:05:52.930
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:56.737
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

01:05:57.006 --> 01:05:59.532
Why?

01:05:59.758 --> 01:06:04.764
Members of the jury, it is possible for
a woman to read The Life of Disraeli

01:06:05.097 --> 01:06:09.068
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

01:06:11.645 --> 01:06:16.776
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:20.477
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

01:06:20.738 --> 01:06:23.059
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

01:06:23.282 --> 01:06:26.126
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

01:06:26.744 --> 01:06:30.066
You heard Mrs French and the
prisoner discussing her new will?

01:06:30.331 --> 01:06:33.062
Yes. He was to have all
her money, she told him,

01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:37.536
as she had no near relations nor
anybody that meant to her what he did.

01:06:37.838 --> 01:06:41.126
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

01:06:41.383 --> 01:06:44.546
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

01:06:44.804 --> 01:06:47.933
Thank you. That concludes
my examination.

01:06:48.974 --> 01:06:51.545
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

01:06:52.728 --> 01:06:55.777
Would you...? Thank you.

01:06:56.023 --> 01:07:00.233
Miss McKenzie, you have given
evidence about two wills.

01:07:00.528 --> 01:07:02.496
In the old will, that
which was revoked,

01:07:02.696 --> 01:07:06.382
were you not to receive the
bulk of Mrs French's estate?

01:07:06.659 --> 01:07:07.820
That's so.

01:07:07.993 --> 01:07:12.123
Whereas in the new will, except for a
bequest to you of a small annuity,

01:07:12.414 --> 01:07:15.941
the principal beneficiary is
the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:19.851
It'll be a wicked injustice if he
ever touches a penny of that money.

01:07:20.131 --> 01:07:24.295
It is entirely understandable that you
are antagonistic to the prisoner.

01:07:24.593 --> 01:07:27.073
I'm not antagonistic to him.

01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:31.150
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

01:07:32.351 --> 01:07:34.319
I suggest you formed this opinion

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.161
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

01:07:38.441 --> 01:07:42.446
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

01:07:42.736 --> 01:07:45.342
Now. On the night of October 14

01:07:45.573 --> 01:07:48.736
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

01:07:48.993 --> 01:07:52.315
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:55.026
You mean you only heard the voices?

01:07:55.249 --> 01:07:57.980
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:01.214
What makes you say the man's
voice was Leonard Vole's?

01:08:01.464 --> 01:08:05.674
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

01:08:05.968 --> 01:08:09.290
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

01:08:09.555 --> 01:08:12.365
so you probably walked quickly
past the closed door,

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.206
yet you are sure you heard
Leonard Vole's voice?

01:08:15.436 --> 01:08:18.121
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

01:08:18.354 --> 01:08:24.317
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

01:08:24.694 --> 01:08:27.140
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

01:08:27.363 --> 01:08:31.493
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

01:08:31.786 --> 01:08:35.711
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

01:08:35.997 --> 01:08:38.888
Yes. She was fond of a
talk or a good play.

01:08:39.126 --> 01:08:42.255
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

01:08:42.505 --> 01:08:44.587
what you really heard
was the television

01:08:44.799 --> 01:08:47.279
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:51.799
There was a play called Lover's
Leap on the television that night.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:57.384
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

01:08:57.685 --> 01:09:02.533
Because the television was away being
repaired that week, that's why.

01:09:13.368 --> 01:09:15.178
Silence! Silence!

01:09:16.956 --> 01:09:19.960
Odd. It's not time yet.

01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:23.133
If my learned friend has no
further questions, I'd like...

01:09:23.379 --> 01:09:26.349
I have not quite finished.

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:31.038
You are registered, are you not, under
the National Health Insurance Act?

01:09:31.345 --> 01:09:34.952
Aye, that's so. Four and
sixpence I pay out every week.

01:09:35.224 --> 01:09:38.148
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

01:09:38.394 --> 01:09:41.203
I am sure that many agree with you.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:47.606
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health Insurance for...

01:09:47.987 --> 01:09:51.469
- ...a hearing aid?
- For... for what?

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:54.630
I protest against the way in
which this question was put!

01:09:54.869 --> 01:09:57.839
I will repeat the
question, my lord.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:03.803
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:08.858
did you apply to the National
Health Insurance for a hearing aid?

01:10:09.175 --> 01:10:10.176
Yes, I did.

01:10:10.342 --> 01:10:12.663
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

01:10:12.887 --> 01:10:17.973
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

01:10:18.309 --> 01:10:21.392
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

01:10:21.645 --> 01:10:24.615
that you could distinguish
the voice of...

01:10:24.857 --> 01:10:26.985
...the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

01:10:27.193 --> 01:10:29.161
Who? Who?

01:10:30.446 --> 01:10:32.414
No further questions.

01:10:34.867 --> 01:10:37.154
Och, maybe you could
help me, Your Lordship.

01:10:37.369 --> 01:10:41.294
Six months ago I applied for my hearing
aid, and I'm still waiting for it.

01:10:41.582 --> 01:10:46.349
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering the
rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:49.514
you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.

01:10:52.301 --> 01:10:55.430
Call Police Constable Jeffries.

01:10:55.679 --> 01:10:59.809
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

01:11:10.528 --> 01:11:13.259
I swear by Almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

01:11:13.489 --> 01:11:18.370
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

01:11:31.841 --> 01:11:34.606
Mr Myers, does that
conclude your case?

01:11:34.844 --> 01:11:39.645
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

01:11:40.349 --> 01:11:43.637
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

01:11:55.406 --> 01:11:57.374
Christine.

01:12:08.294 --> 01:12:10.900
I swear by Almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:14.612
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

01:12:14.884 --> 01:12:17.410
My lord, I have the
most serious objection

01:12:17.636 --> 01:12:21.561
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

01:12:21.849 --> 01:12:23.851
I call my learned
friend's attention

01:12:24.059 --> 01:12:28.428
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

01:12:28.731 --> 01:12:32.656
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

01:12:32.943 --> 01:12:36.425
And you have been living as the
wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

01:12:36.697 --> 01:12:39.268
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

01:12:39.909 --> 01:12:41.399
No.

01:12:41.577 --> 01:12:45.901
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

01:12:46.207 --> 01:12:48.733
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

01:12:48.959 --> 01:12:52.281
There is proof of a marriage between
the witness and the prisoner,

01:12:52.546 --> 01:12:55.390
but is there any proof of a
so-called previous marriage?

01:12:55.633 --> 01:13:01.037
My lord, the so-called previous
marriage is, in fact, well-documented.

01:13:01.388 --> 01:13:07.157
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.048
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

01:13:12.358 --> 01:13:15.089
Yes, that is the paper
of my marriage.

01:13:15.319 --> 01:13:21.008
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

01:13:25.454 --> 01:13:29.823
You're willing to give evidence against
the man you've been calling your husband?

01:13:30.126 --> 01:13:31.537
Yes.

01:13:32.253 --> 01:13:35.860
You stated to the police that on the
night that Mrs French was murdered,

01:13:36.132 --> 01:13:41.172
Leonard Vole left the house at 7:30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

01:13:41.512 --> 01:13:44.038
Did he, in fact,
return at 25 past 9?

01:13:45.808 --> 01:13:48.857
No. He returned at ten
minutes past ten.

01:13:49.103 --> 01:13:53.586
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

01:13:57.361 --> 01:13:59.409
Silence!

01:13:59.613 --> 01:14:01.581
I must have silence.

01:14:03.075 --> 01:14:05.965
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

01:14:06.203 --> 01:14:09.047
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:13.261
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

01:14:13.544 --> 01:14:16.946
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

01:14:17.214 --> 01:14:19.820
He threw off his coat and
examined the sleeves.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:22.178
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

01:14:22.386 --> 01:14:24.468
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:27.570
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

01:14:27.808 --> 01:14:29.970
He said "I've killed her."

01:14:30.186 --> 01:14:34.510
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

01:14:34.815 --> 01:14:38.820
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

01:14:42.239 --> 01:14:45.561
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

01:14:45.826 --> 01:14:48.875
so that the prisoner may
gain control of himself.

01:14:49.121 --> 01:14:52.728
My lord is most gracious, but
pray let the witness continue.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.085
We are all of us caught up in the
suspense of this horror fiction.

01:14:57.379 --> 01:15:01.100
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

01:15:01.383 --> 01:15:04.193
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

01:15:04.428 --> 01:15:09.036
when the prisoner said "I have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:12.081
It was that woman he had
been seeing so often.

01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:16.873
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

01:15:17.191 --> 01:15:19.478
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

01:15:19.693 --> 01:15:21.695
But you've changed
your story now. Why?

01:15:21.904 --> 01:15:24.032
I cannot go on lying to save him.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:27.449
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

01:15:27.701 --> 01:15:30.352
He married me and brought
me to this country.

01:15:30.579 --> 01:15:33.503
What he has asked me to do I
have because I was grateful.

01:15:33.749 --> 01:15:36.673
It was not because he was your
husband and you loved him?

01:15:36.919 --> 01:15:38.887
I never loved him.

01:15:39.463 --> 01:15:42.512
It was gratitude, then, that
prompted you to give him an alibi

01:15:42.758 --> 01:15:46.126
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

01:15:46.387 --> 01:15:49.789
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

01:15:50.057 --> 01:15:52.105
That woman, she was a
harmless old fool,

01:15:52.309 --> 01:15:54.755
and he makes of me an
accomplice to the murder.

01:15:54.979 --> 01:15:58.825
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

01:15:59.108 --> 01:16:01.679
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

01:16:01.902 --> 01:16:04.064
Then this is the truth?

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.682
That Leonard Vole returned that
night at ten minutes past ten,

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:09.952
he had blood on the
sleeves of his coat,

01:16:10.161 --> 01:16:14.132
and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?

01:16:15.958 --> 01:16:17.642
That is the truth.

01:16:17.835 --> 01:16:20.884
That is the truth, before God?

01:16:21.130 --> 01:16:23.178
That is the truth.

01:16:23.757 --> 01:16:25.725
Thank you.

01:16:31.015 --> 01:16:34.417
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm, which
do you prefer to be called?

01:16:34.685 --> 01:16:36.653
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

01:16:36.854 --> 01:16:40.745
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

01:16:41.025 --> 01:16:46.031
However, it would appear that when you
first met the prisoner in Hamburg

01:16:46.363 --> 01:16:50.687
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...

01:16:50.993 --> 01:16:53.963
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

01:16:54.205 --> 01:16:56.173
- Yes.
- Thank you.

01:16:56.373 --> 01:16:59.343
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

01:16:59.585 --> 01:17:02.395
I, um, did not tell the
truth to the authorities.

01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:04.792
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

01:17:05.007 --> 01:17:09.217
And in the ceremony, when you swore to
love, honour and cherish your husband,

01:17:09.512 --> 01:17:11.913
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

01:17:12.139 --> 01:17:15.268
And when the police questioned
you about this wretched man

01:17:15.518 --> 01:17:17.839
who believed himself
married and loved,

01:17:18.062 --> 01:17:20.463
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:24.375
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

01:17:24.652 --> 01:17:28.782
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

01:17:29.073 --> 01:17:33.283
And when you said that he had accidentally
cut his wrist, again, you lied?

01:17:33.577 --> 01:17:38.265
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

01:17:38.582 --> 01:17:41.984
The question is, Frau Helm, were
you lying then, are you lying now?

01:17:42.253 --> 01:17:45.860
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

01:17:49.677 --> 01:17:53.841
Carter, Carter! The other
pill. Under the tongue.

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:58.304
My lord, is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness?

01:17:58.602 --> 01:18:02.652
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:06.911
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

01:18:10.239 --> 01:18:12.719
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:16.716
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

01:18:16.996 --> 01:18:20.762
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

01:18:21.041 --> 01:18:23.612
when she was sworn here today.

01:18:23.836 --> 01:18:27.966
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

01:18:28.257 --> 01:18:30.305
That will be all, Frau Helm.

01:18:35.347 --> 01:18:39.636
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

01:18:39.935 --> 01:18:43.417
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.

01:18:43.689 --> 01:18:45.691
It means to swear
falsely under oath.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.629
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

01:18:47.818 --> 01:18:52.585
that the penalty in this country for
perjury is a heavy term of imprisonment?

01:18:52.907 --> 01:18:55.274
Yes, I'm aware.

01:18:55.493 --> 01:19:00.055
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

01:19:00.372 --> 01:19:03.854
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

01:19:04.126 --> 01:19:06.015
So help me, God.

01:19:07.254 --> 01:19:11.498
Then that, my lord, is the
case for the prosecution.

01:19:29.443 --> 01:19:33.129
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

01:19:33.405 --> 01:19:37.933
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

01:19:38.244 --> 01:19:39.166
Silence.

01:19:41.455 --> 01:19:45.016
Sir Wilfrid. Are you
ready for the defence?

01:19:47.336 --> 01:19:50.977
My lord, members of the jury,

01:19:51.257 --> 01:19:56.218
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

01:19:56.554 --> 01:20:00.764
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

01:20:01.058 --> 01:20:04.460
Among the witnesses you have
heard Chief Inspector Hearne,

01:20:04.728 --> 01:20:09.609
who has given his testimony in a fair and
impartial manner, as he always does.

01:20:09.942 --> 01:20:14.664
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

01:20:14.989 --> 01:20:18.789
Whether it is theory or
actual fact, however,

01:20:19.076 --> 01:20:21.522
you will decide for yourselves.

01:20:22.663 --> 01:20:25.667
And then you have heard the
evidence of Janet McKenzie,

01:20:25.916 --> 01:20:29.921
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

01:20:30.212 --> 01:20:32.453
One, the death of her
beloved mistress

01:20:32.673 --> 01:20:38.123
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of £80,000,

01:20:38.471 --> 01:20:41.156
which she'd fully
expected to receive.

01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:45.076
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:50.116
but will express only my
deepest sympathy for her

01:20:50.399 --> 01:20:53.164
in both these... mishaps.

01:20:54.236 --> 01:20:59.720
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

01:21:00.075 --> 01:21:04.558
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

01:21:04.872 --> 01:21:09.400
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:13.317
I objected to her testimony because
a wife cannot give evidence

01:21:13.589 --> 01:21:15.990
harmful to her husband.

01:21:16.217 --> 01:21:22.623
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

01:21:23.015 --> 01:21:28.943
Therefore, her evidence must be
admitted and you must consider it.

01:21:29.313 --> 01:21:32.078
For what it is worth.

01:21:33.818 --> 01:21:38.062
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the tum of the defence.

01:21:38.364 --> 01:21:42.289
We could present, on behalf of the
prisoner, witnesses to his character,

01:21:42.576 --> 01:21:46.376
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

01:21:46.664 --> 01:21:52.148
However, only one witness
can shed new light

01:21:52.503 --> 01:21:55.268
on this tragic riddle.

01:21:56.465 --> 01:21:58.433
The prisoner himself.

01:21:59.969 --> 01:22:02.051
Members of the jury,

01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:05.710
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

01:22:25.119 --> 01:22:28.328
I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence I give will be the truth,

01:22:28.581 --> 01:22:31.630
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:36.965
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

01:22:37.256 --> 01:22:40.226
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

01:22:40.468 --> 01:22:45.554
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did you
not on the night of October 14 last,

01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:48.052
murder Emily Jane French?

01:22:48.726 --> 01:22:52.492
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

01:22:54.815 --> 01:22:59.104
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

01:22:59.403 --> 01:23:04.489
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

01:23:04.825 --> 01:23:07.226
The defence feels his
faculties should be spared

01:23:07.453 --> 01:23:10.900
for the cross-examination by my
learned friend for the prosecution.

01:23:11.165 --> 01:23:13.930
This is not a plea
for any indulgence.

01:23:14.168 --> 01:23:17.092
I am confident that no matter
how searching this may be,

01:23:17.338 --> 01:23:20.103
the prisoner will withstand it.

01:23:21.717 --> 01:23:25.244
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

01:23:25.513 --> 01:23:27.481
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

01:23:27.681 --> 01:23:29.683
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

01:23:29.892 --> 01:23:30.654
No.

01:23:30.810 --> 01:23:32.938
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

01:23:33.145 --> 01:23:37.867
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of £80,000?

01:23:38.192 --> 01:23:39.353
No, I didn't.

01:23:39.527 --> 01:23:44.215
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

01:23:44.532 --> 01:23:47.695
did you wear a trench
coat and a brown hat?

01:23:48.786 --> 01:23:52.313
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:55.092
Yes, sir.

01:23:55.251 --> 01:24:00.257
My lord, the defence, in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

01:24:00.589 --> 01:24:03.718
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

01:24:03.968 --> 01:24:07.051
who had seen him leaving Mrs
French's house or entering his own

01:24:07.304 --> 01:24:09.784
at the times that he has stated.

01:24:10.015 --> 01:24:13.337
Apparently, this splendid
effort was without results.

01:24:13.602 --> 01:24:15.889
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

01:24:16.105 --> 01:24:19.188
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

01:24:19.442 --> 01:24:23.925
and that the prisoner had been seen
wearing this coat and this hat.

01:24:24.238 --> 01:24:29.449
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

01:24:29.785 --> 01:24:33.915
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

01:24:34.206 --> 01:24:38.097
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

01:24:38.377 --> 01:24:41.540
Supposing I did?
It's not a crime, is it?

01:24:41.797 --> 01:24:45.768
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

01:24:46.051 --> 01:24:50.898
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

01:24:51.223 --> 01:24:56.263
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

01:24:56.604 --> 01:24:58.925
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

01:24:59.815 --> 01:25:01.817
My lord, the lady was
so described to me.

01:25:02.026 --> 01:25:06.315
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

01:25:06.614 --> 01:25:08.503
Oh.

01:25:09.325 --> 01:25:13.728
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

01:25:14.038 --> 01:25:16.120
How did you expect to
pay for such a thing?

01:25:16.332 --> 01:25:19.461
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:23.920
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

01:25:24.215 --> 01:25:26.502
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

01:25:26.717 --> 01:25:29.687
And in the afternoon, you
started plans to dispose of it.

01:25:29.929 --> 01:25:32.057
No! It was nothing of the kind.

01:25:32.264 --> 01:25:35.313
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

01:25:35.559 --> 01:25:37.607
We had a drink and
walked out together.

01:25:37.812 --> 01:25:43.615
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

01:25:43.984 --> 01:25:49.070
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went
in for fun and I started asking for folders.

01:25:49.406 --> 01:25:53.127
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:56.698
Anyway, it irritated me, so I kept
asking for the swankiest tours,

01:25:56.956 --> 01:26:00.324
all deluxe and cabin on the boat
deck, but it was just an act!

01:26:00.584 --> 01:26:04.589
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit £80,000!

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:09.249
No! it wasn't that way at all. It was
make-believe and childish but...

01:26:09.552 --> 01:26:13.796
it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money.

01:26:14.098 --> 01:26:17.898
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

01:26:18.185 --> 01:26:20.552
I told you! I didn't kill her!

01:26:21.272 --> 01:26:25.197
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

01:26:25.484 --> 01:26:29.170
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:35.070
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

01:26:35.411 --> 01:26:37.937
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

01:26:38.164 --> 01:26:42.488
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

01:26:42.793 --> 01:26:45.239
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

01:26:45.463 --> 01:26:49.388
Very effective, I'm sure. But in
this court we deal with fact.

01:26:49.675 --> 01:26:52.485
And the fact, Mr Vole, is that
we've only your word for it.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.530
That you left Mrs French's
house at the time you say,

01:26:55.765 --> 01:27:00.373
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

01:27:00.686 --> 01:27:03.735
Somebody must have seen me in the
street or going in the house!

01:27:03.981 --> 01:27:08.191
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

01:27:08.486 --> 01:27:11.649
says it was ten past ten and that
you had blood on your hands.

01:27:11.906 --> 01:27:14.796
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

01:27:15.034 --> 01:27:17.002
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

01:27:17.203 --> 01:27:20.013
But you make it sound as though
I did. I can hear it myself.

01:27:20.247 --> 01:27:22.375
You came home at ten past ten!

01:27:22.583 --> 01:27:26.793
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

01:27:27.087 --> 01:27:29.215
You killed Emily French!

01:27:29.423 --> 01:27:31.664
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

01:27:31.884 --> 01:27:35.605
I didn't kill her!
I never killed anybody!

01:27:35.888 --> 01:27:40.291
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

01:27:46.148 --> 01:27:48.515
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

01:27:48.734 --> 01:27:50.896
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

01:27:51.112 --> 01:27:56.243
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

01:27:57.493 --> 01:27:58.460
What?

01:27:58.619 --> 01:28:02.988
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:07.181
It'll all be over by the afternoon, and
the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:10.749
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

01:28:11.006 --> 01:28:15.375
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm
bath and your calcium injection.

01:28:15.678 --> 01:28:18.522
And there's a lot more
packing to be done.

01:28:19.598 --> 01:28:24.240
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

01:28:24.562 --> 01:28:28.726
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

01:28:30.943 --> 01:28:34.425
I watched when Frau Helm was on
the stand. They didn't like her.

01:28:34.697 --> 01:28:38.782
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

01:28:39.076 --> 01:28:42.205
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

01:28:42.455 --> 01:28:43.263
No.

01:28:43.414 --> 01:28:46.099
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

01:28:46.333 --> 01:28:47.619
I'm not sure.

01:28:47.793 --> 01:28:51.400
I am. She lied. Whether she calls
it Meineid or perjury, she lied.

01:28:51.672 --> 01:28:56.519
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

01:28:57.303 --> 01:29:02.264
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.410
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:09.046
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

01:29:09.315 --> 01:29:12.922
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

01:29:13.194 --> 01:29:16.880
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters... his life.

01:29:17.156 --> 01:29:19.921
He's entitled to the
best that I can do.

01:29:20.159 --> 01:29:24.050
If I can't stand up to make my final
appeal for him, I'll make it sitting down.

01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:28.494
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,
or two pills, or all of them and the box too.

01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:39.520
- Yes?
- This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?

01:29:39.762 --> 01:29:43.050
- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.

01:29:43.307 --> 01:29:47.517
- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.

01:29:47.812 --> 01:29:51.214
I'm afraid that's impossible. What
is the nature of your business?

01:29:51.482 --> 01:29:54.645
It's business all right. I've got
something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

01:29:54.902 --> 01:29:56.108
Well, really, madam!

01:29:56.278 --> 01:29:59.168
And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

01:29:59.406 --> 01:30:02.967
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

01:30:03.244 --> 01:30:05.406
It's about that German wife.

01:30:05.621 --> 01:30:09.023
I've got the goods on
her and it's for sale.

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.726
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?

01:30:15.005 --> 01:30:17.246
Well, hello, ducky.

01:30:17.466 --> 01:30:20.276
What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

01:30:20.511 --> 01:30:24.232
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and white.

01:30:24.515 --> 01:30:27.359
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

01:30:27.601 --> 01:30:30.969
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:34.518
I'll be here for 30 minutes because
that's when me train leaves.

01:30:34.775 --> 01:30:37.938
If you want the lowdown on that
German bag, get yourself here.

01:30:38.195 --> 01:30:40.641
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

01:30:40.865 --> 01:30:42.947
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

01:30:43.159 --> 01:30:47.244
You'd better get on over here,
and bring plenty of money.

01:30:48.038 --> 01:30:51.247
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?

01:30:53.252 --> 01:30:58.816
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.

01:30:59.175 --> 01:31:03.544
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.

01:31:03.846 --> 01:31:05.610
Balderdash.

01:31:05.806 --> 01:31:11.051
I'm too old and too sick to
go on a wild-goose chase.

01:31:11.395 --> 01:31:14.160
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

01:31:14.398 --> 01:31:17.368
Euston Station, where do you think?

01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:21.034
Now, sir?

01:31:21.238 --> 01:31:23.002
Shortly.

01:31:23.991 --> 01:31:25.481
Cigar!

01:31:26.452 --> 01:31:28.420
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?

01:31:28.621 --> 01:31:33.149
Your bath, your massage,
your dinner, your injection!

01:31:33.459 --> 01:31:35.427
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

01:32:01.487 --> 01:32:04.411
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.

01:32:04.657 --> 01:32:09.219
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.

01:32:09.537 --> 01:32:11.778
Two o' yer? I'm not
talking to two o' yer.

01:32:11.997 --> 01:32:14.443
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.

01:32:14.667 --> 01:32:17.591
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

01:32:17.837 --> 01:32:23.082
No need for mine. If did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

01:32:23.425 --> 01:32:27.510
'Ave a drink, boys. Two whiskies
for me gen'lmen friends.

01:32:27.805 --> 01:32:30.285
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

01:32:30.516 --> 01:32:34.805
You realise that you're duty-bound to
give any evidence that you might have?

01:32:35.104 --> 01:32:39.553
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

01:32:39.859 --> 01:32:44.183
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

01:32:44.488 --> 01:32:49.130
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

01:32:49.452 --> 01:32:53.218
Poor bleeder, he's been took in by 'er
all right. And these letters prove it.

01:32:53.497 --> 01:32:58.458
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

01:32:58.794 --> 01:33:01.445
Well, I don't expect you...

01:33:04.758 --> 01:33:08.649
Well, as I say, I don't expect you to
buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

01:33:08.929 --> 01:33:13.298
If these letters get the boy off,
it's £100 for me, right?

01:33:13.601 --> 01:33:18.289
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer £10.

01:33:18.606 --> 01:33:21.894
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

01:33:22.151 --> 01:33:24.882
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

01:33:25.112 --> 01:33:27.160
If these help prove my
client's innocence,

01:33:27.364 --> 01:33:30.766
£20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

01:33:31.035 --> 01:33:33.959
50 and it's a bargain. That's
if you're satisfied with 'em.

01:33:34.205 --> 01:33:36.492
- £40.
- All right, blast yer.

01:33:36.707 --> 01:33:39.472
'Ere, take 'em.
Nice little lot there.

01:33:39.710 --> 01:33:41.678
How do we know these
are from Mrs Vole?

01:33:41.879 --> 01:33:46.043
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

01:33:48.803 --> 01:33:51.568
I 'ope they fix 'er
good and proper.

01:33:53.557 --> 01:33:57.278
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

01:33:57.561 --> 01:33:59.928
Good heavens, look at this.

01:34:02.608 --> 01:34:04.576
Juicy, ain't they?

01:34:04.777 --> 01:34:08.577
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

01:34:08.864 --> 01:34:11.834
What's the difference so long
as she gets what's coming?

01:34:12.076 --> 01:34:15.125
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

01:34:15.371 --> 01:34:18.659
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

01:34:19.875 --> 01:34:22.242
Want to kiss me, ducky?

01:34:26.006 --> 01:34:26.768
Ha!

01:34:26.924 --> 01:34:30.724
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

01:34:31.011 --> 01:34:35.778
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:40.901
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:46.441
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

01:34:46.777 --> 01:34:50.987
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

01:34:51.282 --> 01:34:56.812
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin'
'im away from me, turnin' 'im against me.

01:34:57.163 --> 01:35:01.885
But I waited me time to pay
'er back. And it's come now.

01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:07.295
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry. We'll
make it another £5 for the letters.

01:35:07.631 --> 01:35:11.795
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

01:35:12.094 --> 01:35:15.541
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.

01:35:17.641 --> 01:35:20.121
Unbelievable.

01:35:20.352 --> 01:35:24.482
We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

01:35:24.774 --> 01:35:26.697
Miss, um...

01:35:26.901 --> 01:35:28.710
Where is she?

01:35:34.784 --> 01:35:40.348
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

01:35:42.958 --> 01:35:44.960
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

01:35:45.169 --> 01:35:47.137
Good idea.

01:35:56.222 --> 01:35:57.667
Silence!

01:35:57.848 --> 01:35:59.896
Be upstanding in court.

01:36:01.018 --> 01:36:03.624
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

01:36:03.854 --> 01:36:05.902
the queen's justices
of oyer and terminer

01:36:06.107 --> 01:36:09.953
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,

01:36:10.236 --> 01:36:14.400
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:31.583
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

01:36:31.841 --> 01:36:34.162
it has the right to be heard last.

01:36:34.385 --> 01:36:40.427
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

01:36:40.808 --> 01:36:45.018
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

01:36:45.312 --> 01:36:49.840
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

01:36:50.151 --> 01:36:53.439
that a verdict of guilty must be
the only possible conclusion.

01:36:54.196 --> 01:36:57.757
I will briefly summarise
these facts...

01:37:03.664 --> 01:37:05.871
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

01:37:06.542 --> 01:37:10.672
That is, if Sir Wilfrid is at all
interested in our proceedings.

01:37:10.963 --> 01:37:15.252
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech for
the crown, however, is premature.

01:37:15.551 --> 01:37:20.352
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

01:37:20.681 --> 01:37:24.402
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

01:37:24.685 --> 01:37:27.814
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

01:37:28.063 --> 01:37:31.351
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

01:37:31.609 --> 01:37:35.250
I have anticipated this objection and
can meet it with ample precedent.

01:37:35.529 --> 01:37:41.093
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

01:37:41.452 --> 01:37:43.773
at page 463.

01:37:43.996 --> 01:37:48.081
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

01:37:48.375 --> 01:37:51.663
1942 at page 153.

01:37:51.921 --> 01:37:54.686
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

01:37:54.924 --> 01:37:58.849
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

01:37:59.136 --> 01:38:01.616
since you appeared
for the prosecution.

01:38:01.847 --> 01:38:06.375
I did? Oh, yes, before
Mr Justice Swindon.

01:38:06.685 --> 01:38:08.847
What is this new
evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

01:38:09.063 --> 01:38:11.065
Letters, my lord.

01:38:11.273 --> 01:38:14.243
Letters written by Christine Helm.

01:38:16.695 --> 01:38:20.142
My lord, the prosecution
continues its objection.

01:38:20.407 --> 01:38:23.809
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

01:38:24.078 --> 01:38:27.685
in the king against
Sullivan was sustained.

01:38:29.708 --> 01:38:33.155
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:37.789
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

01:38:38.092 --> 01:38:41.141
As yours is now, by me.

01:38:47.643 --> 01:38:49.771
Call Christine Helm.

01:38:50.646 --> 01:38:52.250
Christine Helm.

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:55.125
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.

01:39:11.834 --> 01:39:16.635
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I
wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.

01:39:16.964 --> 01:39:20.810
Mrs Helm, you appreciate
you are still under oath?

01:39:21.093 --> 01:39:22.254
Yes.

01:39:22.428 --> 01:39:27.912
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

01:39:28.267 --> 01:39:32.113
It's a simple question. Do you or
do you not know a man called Max?

01:39:32.396 --> 01:39:34.603
Max? Certainly not.

01:39:34.815 --> 01:39:38.501
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

01:39:38.778 --> 01:39:41.179
In Germany, perhaps,
but a long time ago.

01:39:41.405 --> 01:39:48.015
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

01:39:49.914 --> 01:39:52.758
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.241
I suggest that on October 20

01:39:55.461 --> 01:39:58.670
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:39:58.923 --> 01:40:02.291
- ...Addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:06.476
The letter was but one of a
series written to the same man.

01:40:07.473 --> 01:40:09.521
Lies! All lies!

01:40:09.725 --> 01:40:13.696
You seem to have been, well, let us
say, on intimate terms with this man.

01:40:13.979 --> 01:40:16.630
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

01:40:16.857 --> 01:40:22.148
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

01:40:22.488 --> 01:40:27.176
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary
thing has happened."

01:40:27.493 --> 01:40:30.337
"I believe all our
difficulties may be ended."

01:40:30.579 --> 01:40:33.059
I will not stand here and
listen to a pack of lies!

01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:36.976
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

01:40:37.253 --> 01:40:39.460
- It isn't?
- No!

01:40:39.672 --> 01:40:42.960
I write my letters on small blue
paper with my initials on it.

01:40:47.179 --> 01:40:48.669
Like this?

01:40:51.434 --> 01:40:56.565
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair
of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.

01:40:58.357 --> 01:41:02.646
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we
call him and that's what he is.

01:41:02.945 --> 01:41:07.109
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind
enough to identify your letter paper.

01:41:07.408 --> 01:41:12.130
Now, if you like, I can have an
expert identify your handwriting.

01:41:12.455 --> 01:41:14.264
Damn you!

01:41:14.832 --> 01:41:17.722
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:20.088
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!

01:41:20.296 --> 01:41:23.664
Let me go! Let me get
out of here! Let me go!

01:41:23.924 --> 01:41:25.289
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!

01:41:25.468 --> 01:41:28.074
Usher, get the witness a chair.

01:41:34.477 --> 01:41:40.439
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

01:41:45.738 --> 01:41:50.824
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary
thing has happened."

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.687
"All our difficulties
may soon be solved."

01:41:54.955 --> 01:41:59.836
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about."

01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:05.778
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone."

01:42:07.051 --> 01:42:13.058
"Suppose I testify that he was not at
home with me at the time of the murder,

01:42:13.432 --> 01:42:17.153
that he came home with
blood on his sleeves,

01:42:17.436 --> 01:42:21.202
and that he even admitted to
me that he'd killed her?"

01:42:21.482 --> 01:42:24.804
"Strange that he always said he
would never let me leave him."

01:42:25.069 --> 01:42:28.551
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me

01:42:28.823 --> 01:42:32.544
because they will
take him away forever

01:42:32.827 --> 01:42:37.389
and I shall be free and
yours, my beloved."

01:42:37.706 --> 01:42:42.348
"I count the hours until we
are together. Christine."

01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:49.389
Mrs Helm? Will you go
back to the witness box?

01:42:59.728 --> 01:43:04.768
I now ask you again, Christine
Helm, did you write this letter?

01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:08.238
Christine, tell him you didn't
write it. I know you didn't.

01:43:08.487 --> 01:43:12.458
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

01:43:12.741 --> 01:43:14.470
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:19.826
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

01:43:20.166 --> 01:43:23.613
If you have already committed
perjury in this courtroom,

01:43:23.878 --> 01:43:27.360
I strongly advise you not
to add to your crime.

01:43:27.631 --> 01:43:31.238
But, if this letter has
not been written by you,

01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:35.071
then now is the time
to state this fact.

01:43:37.725 --> 01:43:39.807
I wrote the letter.

01:43:42.396 --> 01:43:46.162
And that, my lord, is the
case for the defence.

01:43:54.158 --> 01:43:57.446
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

01:43:57.703 --> 01:43:59.785
Stop pressing your luck,
you're overdue.

01:43:59.997 --> 01:44:03.968
We're all packed and ready. I hope
the jury won't take all afternoon.

01:44:04.251 --> 01:44:05.412
I concede.

01:44:05.586 --> 01:44:08.669
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

01:44:08.923 --> 01:44:12.291
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

01:44:12.551 --> 01:44:15.839
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

01:44:16.097 --> 01:44:20.068
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

01:44:20.351 --> 01:44:23.480
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

01:44:23.729 --> 01:44:27.734
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

01:44:28.109 --> 01:44:29.873
Come along.

01:44:30.903 --> 01:44:32.871
Where's my Wig?

01:45:01.892 --> 01:45:04.259
The prisoner will stand up.

01:45:06.897 --> 01:45:11.664
Members of the jury, are you
all agreed upon your verdict?

01:45:13.404 --> 01:45:14.610
We are.

01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:18.865
Do you find the prisoner at the
bar, Leonard Stephen Vole,

01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:23.529
guilty or not guilty of the
murder of Emily Jane French?

01:45:27.626 --> 01:45:28.991
Not guilty, m'lord.

01:45:49.064 --> 01:45:50.350
Silence!

01:45:50.649 --> 01:45:52.333
Silence!

01:45:55.321 --> 01:45:58.962
Leonard Stephen Vole, you
have been found not guilty

01:45:59.241 --> 01:46:03.644
of the murder of Emily
Jane French on October 14.

01:46:03.954 --> 01:46:08.278
You are hereby discharged and
are free to leave the court.

01:46:19.345 --> 01:46:22.554
Persons with anything more to
do before the queen's justices

01:46:22.807 --> 01:46:24.969
of oyer and terminer
and jail delivery

01:46:25.184 --> 01:46:29.951
for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.

01:46:38.864 --> 01:46:42.425
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

01:46:42.701 --> 01:46:45.102
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

01:46:45.329 --> 01:46:48.617
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

01:46:48.874 --> 01:46:52.560
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

01:46:52.837 --> 01:46:56.523
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

01:46:56.799 --> 01:46:59.803
"Mr Vole." They didn't call
me Mr when they charged me.

01:47:00.052 --> 01:47:05.013
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!

01:47:14.692 --> 01:47:17.821
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,
he had one foot on the gallows

01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:20.118
and the other on a banana peel.

01:47:20.322 --> 01:47:23.405
You ought to be very proud,
Wilfrid. Aren't you?

01:47:23.659 --> 01:47:26.549
Not yet. We've disposed
of the gallows,

01:47:26.787 --> 01:47:30.712
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

01:47:44.472 --> 01:47:48.955
- Every word you said was a lie!
- You ought to be locked up! Liar!

01:47:49.268 --> 01:47:52.477
You'd better wait here until we
get rid of that crowd, madam.

01:47:52.730 --> 01:47:54.698
Thank you.

01:47:58.527 --> 01:48:01.690
Ready, sir?
Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

01:48:01.947 --> 01:48:07.272
Let me finish the last of the cocoa while
I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:11.830
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

01:48:38.943 --> 01:48:42.868
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

01:48:43.155 --> 01:48:45.601
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

01:48:45.825 --> 01:48:49.591
I don't mind being called names or pushed
around or even kicked in the shin.

01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:52.111
But I have a ladder in
my last pair of nylons.

01:48:52.331 --> 01:48:56.461
In case you are not familiar with our
prison regulations, no silk stockings.

01:48:56.752 --> 01:48:58.880
Prison? Will I go to prison?

01:48:59.088 --> 01:49:02.570
You heard the judge. You will
certainly be charged with perjury,

01:49:02.842 --> 01:49:07.006
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

01:49:07.304 --> 01:49:10.786
If I were appearing for the
prosecution, it would be.

01:49:11.058 --> 01:49:14.904
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

01:49:15.187 --> 01:49:18.191
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

01:49:18.441 --> 01:49:22.969
and saved Leonard's life. The great
Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

01:49:23.279 --> 01:49:28.809
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

01:49:30.119 --> 01:49:31.769
What are you driving at?

01:49:31.954 --> 01:49:34.798
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.405
- We?
- Remember?

01:49:36.584 --> 01:49:40.111
When you said that no jury would believe
an alibi given by a loving wife,

01:49:40.379 --> 01:49:44.304
no matter how much she swore he was
innocent? That gave me the idea.

01:49:44.592 --> 01:49:46.117
What idea?

01:49:46.302 --> 01:49:50.626
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

01:49:50.931 --> 01:49:54.731
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

01:49:55.019 --> 01:49:59.104
because only then would they
believe Leonard was innocent.

01:49:59.398 --> 01:50:02.959
So now you know the whole
story, Sir Wilfrid.

01:50:08.407 --> 01:50:12.457
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

01:50:12.745 --> 01:50:15.316
Want to kiss me, ducky?

01:50:19.168 --> 01:50:23.093
I suspected something,
but not that.

01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:26.270
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

01:50:26.509 --> 01:50:30.116
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such a vital role.

01:50:30.387 --> 01:50:33.152
All those blue letters!

01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:36.872
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

01:50:37.144 --> 01:50:39.511
There's never been
anyone but Leonard.

01:50:39.730 --> 01:50:41.892
My dear, could you
not have trusted me,

01:50:42.108 --> 01:50:45.908
worked with me truthfully and
honourably? We would have won.

01:50:46.195 --> 01:50:49.005
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.289
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

01:50:52.535 --> 01:50:55.698
No, Sir Wilfrid, you do
not understand at all.

01:50:55.955 --> 01:50:58.322
I knew he was guilty.

01:51:01.836 --> 01:51:04.680
That can't be true! No!

01:51:06.006 --> 01:51:08.327
Listen to me, once and for all.

01:51:08.551 --> 01:51:11.157
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

01:51:11.387 --> 01:51:14.709
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

01:51:14.974 --> 01:51:17.978
And you saved him? A murderer?

01:51:18.227 --> 01:51:20.275
Again, you don't understand.

01:51:20.479 --> 01:51:22.447
I love him.

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:30.607
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

01:51:30.823 --> 01:51:32.393
Leonard!

01:51:32.575 --> 01:51:35.624
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:37.838
Leonard, Leonard.

01:51:39.957 --> 01:51:45.248
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

01:51:45.588 --> 01:51:51.038
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got out of
this alive, let's stay this way.

01:51:51.385 --> 01:51:54.753
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

01:51:55.014 --> 01:51:58.143
Who did? You got me off and
I can't be tried again for this.

01:51:58.392 --> 01:52:02.795
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

01:52:03.105 --> 01:52:05.711
The scales of justice may
tip one way or another,

01:52:05.941 --> 01:52:08.945
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

01:52:09.195 --> 01:52:13.200
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather pay
for it as soon as possible and in cash.

01:52:13.491 --> 01:52:17.860
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

01:52:18.162 --> 01:52:21.006
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

01:52:21.248 --> 01:52:24.695
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:29.761
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

01:52:30.091 --> 01:52:33.652
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be £5,000 for the defence.

01:52:33.928 --> 01:52:38.490
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

01:52:38.808 --> 01:52:43.575
Standing in the witness box, having to
face you, saying I never loved you.

01:52:43.896 --> 01:52:45.057
What is it, Leonard?

01:52:45.231 --> 01:52:48.952
The luggage is in the car and we've only
20 minutes to catch the boat train.

01:52:49.235 --> 01:52:51.715
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

01:52:51.946 --> 01:52:53.232
Len!

01:52:53.405 --> 01:52:55.009
Oh, Len!

01:52:55.199 --> 01:52:56.769
Len...

01:52:58.452 --> 01:53:02.013
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

01:53:02.289 --> 01:53:04.690
Leonard, who's this girl?

01:53:04.917 --> 01:53:07.523
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

01:53:07.753 --> 01:53:09.517
Tell her, Len.

01:53:09.713 --> 01:53:13.081
Leonard, is this the girl who was
with you in the travel bureau?

01:53:13.342 --> 01:53:16.391
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

01:53:16.637 --> 01:53:21.120
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

01:53:21.434 --> 01:53:25.564
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

01:53:25.855 --> 01:53:31.544
and we're going away on a cruise, just
like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

01:53:31.902 --> 01:53:36.703
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

01:53:37.032 --> 01:53:39.638
You can't, not after what
I've done. I won't let you.

01:53:39.869 --> 01:53:42.713
I saved your life getting
you out of Germany,

01:53:42.955 --> 01:53:46.038
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

01:53:46.292 --> 01:53:50.661
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

01:53:50.963 --> 01:53:53.728
Full yourself together. They'll
have you up for perjury.

01:53:53.966 --> 01:53:58.369
Don't make it worse or they'll
try you as an accessory.

01:53:58.679 --> 01:54:00.886
And you know what that means.

01:54:01.098 --> 01:54:05.581
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:09.342
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

01:54:09.565 --> 01:54:11.488
let them try me for...!

01:54:11.692 --> 01:54:13.456
Argh!

01:54:35.091 --> 01:54:39.460
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

01:54:40.679 --> 01:54:43.000
- What happened?
- She killed him.

01:54:43.224 --> 01:54:45.147
Killed him?

01:54:45.351 --> 01:54:47.513
She executed him.

01:54:49.230 --> 01:54:51.710
Carter, what have you
done with the luggage?

01:54:51.941 --> 01:54:57.425
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

01:55:04.203 --> 01:55:08.003
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

01:55:08.290 --> 01:55:11.931
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

01:55:12.211 --> 01:55:15.181
We are not going yet, are we?

01:55:17.716 --> 01:55:20.481
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

01:55:20.719 --> 01:55:23.290
Get Brogan-Moore to my
chambers, and Mayhew too.

01:55:23.514 --> 01:55:27.644
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

01:55:27.935 --> 01:55:29.699
Sir Wilfrid?

01:55:29.895 --> 01:55:32.466
You've forgotten your brandy.

01:55:55.254 --> 01:55:57.097
The management of
this theatre suggests

01:55:57.298 --> 01:56:01.383
that for the greater entertainment of
friends who have not yet seen the picture,

01:56:01.677 --> 01:56:04.726
you will not divulge to anyone
the secret of the ending

01:56:04.972 --> 01:56:07.623
of "Witness For The Prosecution".
