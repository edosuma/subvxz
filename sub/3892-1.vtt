MOON Jung-hee

01:25.669 --> 01:27.546
You gave it to me to use it.

01:27.797 --> 01:29.673
<i>Only in case of emergency.</i>

01:29.799 --> 01:32.176
<i>And you used it at a bar!
With who?</i>

01:32.301 --> 01:34.303
So annoying!

01:34.428 --> 01:36.889
Don't be so petty.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.225
- What the hell?
- Come on, sweetie.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.684
- Let go!
- Let's have fun.

01:40.810 --> 01:41.769
Let go of me!

01:42.728 --> 01:43.854
Fuck off!

01:44.355 --> 01:47.108
<i>Eun-hye! Are you okay?</i>

01:49.110 --> 01:51.195
Sweetie, you heard it too, right?

01:52.363 --> 01:55.449
I've had it!
I can't live here anymore!

01:56.617 --> 01:58.494
I got no money to move!

01:59.495 --> 02:01.914
You said you'll help me move.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.292
Forget it.

02:06.001 --> 02:06.877
Drop it.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.670
<i>- Eun-hye!</i>
- Just drop it!

02:28.816 --> 02:30.776
Goddammit!

03:49.313 --> 03:51.315
You know that next door asshole?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.984
Yeah that fuck,

03:54.109 --> 03:55.986
I bumped into him again.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.322
Sporting a helmet no less.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.660
2 days ago,

04:02.910 --> 04:06.705
he was meandering near my door.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.000
You know what,

04:10.251 --> 04:13.045
I lost my keys the other day.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.923
So I called the locksmith.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.091
Shouldn't he

04:18.341 --> 04:20.552
ask for my ID or something?

04:21.637 --> 04:24.515
He just opened it,

04:24.640 --> 04:26.517
and that asshole was peeping.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.688
One sec.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.630
Come out!

04:58.173 --> 04:59.758
Open this goddamn door!

05:03.095 --> 05:04.847
You worthless shit!

05:05.306 --> 05:07.224
You thought I wouldn't find out?

05:08.017 --> 05:10.644
Too bad for you,
I recorded everything!

05:10.936 --> 05:13.397
I'm gonna call the cops,
you're fucked now!

05:22.406 --> 05:24.283
You're finished!

06:31.642 --> 06:33.268
Whatcha doing there?

06:35.479 --> 06:36.647
Where do you live?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.107
Where's mom?

06:39.191 --> 06:41.777
It's past your bedtime.

06:59.837 --> 07:03.048
<i>Scared that I'm gonna
call the cops?</i>

08:21.376 --> 08:23.504
<i>There's a weird rumor</i>

08:23.879 --> 08:26.089
<i>going around in my neighborhood.</i>

08:27.424 --> 08:30.260
<i>It's about squatters</i>

08:31.595 --> 08:36.015
<i>hiding in others' homes,
and secretly living there.</i>

08:40.812 --> 08:43.412
HIDE AND SEEK

08:49.446 --> 08:54.117
<i>Where could they be?</i>

08:55.619 --> 09:00.290
<i>Hide well, I'll find you.</i>

09:01.667 --> 09:03.794
<i>Here I come!</i>

09:06.922 --> 09:08.173
Where could they be?

09:09.424 --> 09:10.884
Near the bed?

09:17.224 --> 09:19.560
Gotcha, I found you!

09:36.118 --> 09:37.202
Let's get Ho-seh!

09:37.327 --> 09:40.330
- Got you!
- We got you!

10:04.187 --> 10:05.772
He's here again.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.364
Does he come by often?

10:15.991 --> 10:17.367
Don't even mention it,

10:17.534 --> 10:19.828
always blabbering on.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.206
He doesn't look sane.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.586
Why here of all the places?

10:27.711 --> 10:29.046
Did he ever come inside?

10:29.379 --> 10:32.382
Not so far, but who knows.

10:33.842 --> 10:34.926
Boss,

10:35.427 --> 10:37.387
shouldn't we report him?

12:02.305 --> 12:03.348
Honey.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.852
Did you take the pills?

12:08.854 --> 12:11.440
Tell me if it gets too hard.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.280
Dad, Ho-seh is being mean.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.908
Ho-seh, apologize.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.494
No, she started it!

12:24.661 --> 12:26.079
No, I didn't!

12:26.204 --> 12:29.791
- Liar! You teased first!
- I didn't!

12:29.916 --> 12:31.251
Stop! Stop it.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.002
Hello?

12:32.419 --> 12:33.545
<i>Hello?</i>

12:34.671 --> 12:36.381
I'm so sorry,

12:36.506 --> 12:38.216
could you repeat that?

12:38.341 --> 12:41.970
<i>Do you know Mr. Baek Sung-chul?</i>

12:42.804 --> 12:43.513
Excuse me?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.682
<i>Mr. Baek Sung-chul.</i>

12:48.018 --> 12:49.060
<i>Hello?</i>

12:50.812 --> 12:51.605
Yes.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.690
<i>Do you know him?</i>

12:54.691 --> 12:55.859
Who is this?

12:56.234 --> 12:57.652
How do you know him?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.821
<i>So you do?</i>

13:05.202 --> 13:06.661
What's this about?

13:07.412 --> 13:09.581
<i>I could be wrong,</i>

13:09.790 --> 13:12.626
<i>but I think he's missing.</i>

13:18.465 --> 13:20.008
Baek Sung-chul: No subject

13:23.094 --> 13:24.513
<i>I heard you moved.</i>

13:25.472 --> 13:27.682
<i>Still no words from you.</i>

13:28.642 --> 13:31.228
<i>There's something
I need to hear from you.</i>

13:56.419 --> 14:00.882
It's your new brother,
Sung-soo, say hi.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.599
<i>I heard you got married
in the USA.</i>

14:10.517 --> 14:12.477
<i>Two kids, I heard.</i>

14:13.311 --> 14:18.149
<i>I can't reach anyone
after mom died.</i>

14:19.818 --> 14:21.987
<i>It's so hard and lonely.</i>

14:22.946 --> 14:25.615
<i>I'll be kicked out of
my place soon.</i>

14:27.033 --> 14:29.202
<i>There's nowhere else to go.</i>

14:30.954 --> 14:32.414
<i>let's meet.</i>

14:32.789 --> 14:34.749
<i>Tell me your address.</i>

14:35.792 --> 14:39.713
<i>I want to ask you something.</i>

15:52.118 --> 15:53.161
<i>Sung-chul!</i>

16:04.214 --> 16:06.591
Our loving parents,
Baek Ki-chul, Kim Soon-hee

16:09.678 --> 16:10.679
Has...

16:12.222 --> 16:15.642
Sung-chul ever been here?

16:17.227 --> 16:17.978
Sung-chul?

16:19.562 --> 16:21.064
Why'd he?

16:26.820 --> 16:29.739
He has no right to come here.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.746
To this day, whenever
his name comes up,

16:37.080 --> 16:39.165
my dad shivers in rage.

16:39.874 --> 16:43.712
<i>I manage Mr. Baek's apartment.</i>

16:43.837 --> 16:48.466
<i>It's been months
since I last talked to him.</i>

16:48.591 --> 16:52.220
<i>I found your number in his room.</i>

16:52.512 --> 16:56.891
<i>Could you come and
pick up his belongings?</i>

16:57.017 --> 16:59.436
Who's Sung-chul?

17:01.438 --> 17:02.230
Honey!

18:03.500 --> 18:05.752
When did he move here?

18:06.544 --> 18:10.173
After he was released,
so about 2 years ago.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.010
You know he went to jail, right?

18:30.193 --> 18:32.487
Could something have
happened to him?

18:33.446 --> 18:35.949
I wouldn't worry too much.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.870
It's a common incident
around here.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.541
Since it's near a harbor,

18:44.707 --> 18:46.793
there are many illegal aliens

18:46.918 --> 18:50.672
who live here briefly,
and flee the country.

18:51.548 --> 18:55.051
With unpaid rents,

18:55.176 --> 18:56.928
this place getting demolished,

18:58.721 --> 19:00.890
he probably took off.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.894
I'll be downstairs, let me know.

20:42.325 --> 20:45.411
<i>He didn't have a co-signer, why?</i>

20:45.536 --> 20:48.414
It looked like

20:49.791 --> 20:52.168
he lived with someone.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.254
<i>I seriously doubt it.</i>

20:55.964 --> 20:57.799
<i>#317?</i>

20:58.007 --> 20:58.925
Yes.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.095
Did something happen?

21:02.220 --> 21:04.681
Do you know the man
who lives there?

21:05.431 --> 21:06.933
I'm not sure...

21:07.976 --> 21:08.810
<i>Who's that?</i>

21:09.519 --> 21:11.271
Sorry, I'm a bit busy.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.368
<i>Speak louder!</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:28.037
That apartment there!
The resident!

21:28.162 --> 21:30.415
I dunno!

21:31.082 --> 21:32.208
Ma'am!

22:05.575 --> 22:08.202
<i>Dad's not home.</i>

22:08.494 --> 22:10.747
<i>He said not to open for strangers.</i>

22:10.872 --> 22:11.956
Hold on.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.752
You don't live with mom?

22:16.586 --> 22:19.547
<i>She died a few years ago.</i>

22:20.256 --> 22:22.133
<i>How did you know?</i>

22:32.435 --> 22:35.271
#414, 2 men.

22:35.438 --> 22:39.025
#415, 1 man, 1 woman, 2 kids.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.570
#416, 2 women.

22:51.245 --> 22:54.540
#317, 1 man,

22:57.293 --> 22:58.586
and...

23:00.296 --> 23:02.048
<i>I'm his wife,</i>

23:02.131 --> 23:03.758
<i>how could he hide that?</i>

23:04.801 --> 23:06.135
What do I do?

23:06.386 --> 23:09.263
- I'm at a loss.
- Mom! Can I play there?

23:09.680 --> 23:12.809
Can't you see I'm speaking
with grandma in America?

23:12.934 --> 23:14.936
I wanna play games.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.145
Yeah! Me too!

23:16.979 --> 23:18.481
Mom, one sec.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.567
Alright, go play.

23:21.692 --> 23:22.068
Okay.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.820
- Take care of Su-ah.
- Got it.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.322
Su-ah! Hold your brother's hand!

23:26.447 --> 23:26.989
Okay!

23:36.999 --> 23:37.959
Now?

23:39.752 --> 23:41.337
We're at his brother's place.

23:41.838 --> 23:42.755
Yeah.

23:48.803 --> 23:51.347
That's what I said.

24:10.408 --> 24:13.911
It looked like he had
some serious problems.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.915
He ran away in high school,
and not a word since.

24:18.958 --> 24:19.876
Yeah.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.388
I'll call you back!

24:45.735 --> 24:47.487
Hey, kiddo.

24:49.405 --> 24:54.410
Did you see the kids
you were playing with?

24:56.078 --> 24:57.205
Pyung-hwa!

24:59.582 --> 25:02.835
I'm sorry,
I was looking for my kids.

25:16.599 --> 25:17.767
Ho-seh!

25:25.775 --> 25:26.651
Su-ah!

25:26.943 --> 25:27.818
Ho-seh!

25:32.281 --> 25:33.449
Ho-seh!

26:11.821 --> 26:12.697
- Mom!
- Mom!

26:12.863 --> 26:13.656
Ho-seh!

26:13.781 --> 26:15.032
- Mom!
- Mom!

26:15.157 --> 26:15.992
Excuse me,

26:16.659 --> 26:19.912
what are you doing?

26:20.329 --> 26:21.789
Get out of there.

26:23.374 --> 26:24.208
Mom!

26:24.333 --> 26:25.793
Ho-seh!

26:25.918 --> 26:27.670
Open this door!

26:28.087 --> 26:30.214
Open the door and get out!

26:30.339 --> 26:33.926
Open this damn door! Get out!

26:37.263 --> 26:37.972
<i>Get out!</i>

26:40.891 --> 26:42.643
Come out of there.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.145
Hurry.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.734
Now, hurry!

26:50.192 --> 26:52.278
Go, go away!

26:56.032 --> 26:56.824
Mom!

26:56.949 --> 26:58.159
- Mom!
- You okay?

26:58.826 --> 26:59.535
Mom...

26:59.660 --> 27:01.537
What happened? You okay?

27:06.542 --> 27:07.752
Are you alright, ma'am?

27:25.811 --> 27:26.729
Ma'am,

27:27.688 --> 27:31.233
You must be startled,
this place is like that.

27:31.359 --> 27:34.236
I can never leave my kid alone.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.572
Thank you so much,

27:36.739 --> 27:38.076
but you don't have to...

27:38.077 --> 27:40.077
It's nothing, please come in for some tea.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.995
I barely have anyone
to talk to here.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.374
Your coat is so pretty,

27:46.499 --> 27:47.917
where did you get it?

27:48.417 --> 27:49.752
Please come in.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.929
Put that on.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.768
Come in.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.771
A bit shabby, isn't it?

28:09.188 --> 28:12.024
But this is the biggest
in the complex.

28:13.567 --> 28:14.527
Please sit down.

28:15.111 --> 28:16.654
Would you like some coffee?

28:20.991 --> 28:24.662
2 apartments were combined into 1.

28:24.912 --> 28:28.124
That's why it's bigger
than others.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.252
It's got a great view too.

28:32.378 --> 28:36.006
We recently moved from
a small place nearby.

28:36.173 --> 28:39.176
We couldn't live a day longer.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.271
Hi, my name is Pyung-hwa,
what's your name?

28:56.819 --> 28:58.529
Her pronunciation's great.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.408
My hubby is in Australia now.

29:03.325 --> 29:06.036
We'll be leaving for it soon.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.583
Her age is perfect
for picking up new languages.

29:11.292 --> 29:12.460
Wanna see the doll?

29:14.587 --> 29:16.255
Su-ah, let her play with it.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.341
No, she's dirty, I hate it here!

29:20.801 --> 29:21.761
Su-ah!

29:22.344 --> 29:23.554
Where's your manner?

29:24.180 --> 29:25.389
Want a time out?

29:29.101 --> 29:29.977
Here.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.030
She's Pyung-hwa, it means 'Peace'.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.908
Pretty name.

29:48.204 --> 29:51.707
I'm worried, she'll have to
attend school soon.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.667
It's so dangerous here.

29:56.420 --> 30:00.382
Your car looked very expensive.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.301
It's really not...

30:02.843 --> 30:05.054
You must be from Seoul,

30:05.721 --> 30:07.723
what brings you to our shabby place?

30:08.849 --> 30:11.227
It's not shabby at all,
it's really cozy.

30:11.685 --> 30:14.563
You got any juicy info?

30:15.064 --> 30:15.731
What?

30:15.898 --> 30:17.399
When will they...

30:17.733 --> 30:19.276
start demolishing?

30:19.568 --> 30:21.403
I heard it could be this month.

30:22.029 --> 30:25.449
We never get to
settle into our new home.

30:25.699 --> 30:26.659
It's nothing like that.

30:28.118 --> 30:30.371
Please give me a heads up.

30:30.579 --> 30:35.042
I was planning to
move to a better place.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.338
Actually,

30:41.590 --> 30:43.259
my brother lives here.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.427
Is that so?

30:45.886 --> 30:46.679
Which one?

30:47.137 --> 30:48.597
Nearby.

30:48.889 --> 30:49.765
Seriously?

30:50.432 --> 30:51.267
Yes.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.269
It's #317.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.190
Are you...

30:59.984 --> 31:00.442
Leave.

31:00.818 --> 31:01.443
Sorry?

31:01.861 --> 31:02.736
Get out!

31:03.028 --> 31:04.446
Get out of my house!

31:05.739 --> 31:07.449
Ma'am, what's wrong?

31:07.575 --> 31:08.826
- Like you don't know?
- Mom!

31:08.951 --> 31:12.037
Perverts like him should be
locked up for good.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.123
How can I raise my kid
with him around?

31:14.248 --> 31:15.583
Do you know anything about him?

31:15.708 --> 31:16.959
Forget it!

31:17.459 --> 31:19.920
I don't want to hear it! Get out!

31:23.549 --> 31:24.592
Please!

31:30.347 --> 31:34.977
<i>Please get him to stop
peeping at my child.</i>

31:36.228 --> 31:36.979
What?

31:37.271 --> 31:39.315
<i>Please stop him!</i>

31:39.815 --> 31:42.484
<i>I can't sleep at night
because of him.</i>

31:42.818 --> 31:44.153
<i>He's driving me crazy!</i>

31:44.278 --> 31:45.487
I don't know what...

31:45.654 --> 31:47.823
<i>I'm losing my mind!</i>

31:52.161 --> 31:55.039
This is way too much to handle!

31:55.331 --> 31:56.665
What's going on?

31:56.790 --> 31:58.542
What did your brother do?

31:59.168 --> 32:00.002
Honey!

32:02.338 --> 32:04.006
Are you alright?

32:04.715 --> 32:05.549
What?

32:06.008 --> 32:10.471
Why not call some people
to clean it up?

32:12.514 --> 32:13.933
Honey!

32:17.561 --> 32:18.979
Head home with the kids.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.106
I'm sorry.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.318
I want to look into it a bit more.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.626
Su-ah, don't rub your eyes.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.044
Why?

32:44.588 --> 32:46.966
Just don't, you'll hurt your eyes.

32:48.175 --> 32:50.719
Let's go see a doctor tomorrow.

33:53.699 --> 33:54.825
<i>Dad!</i>

33:57.703 --> 33:58.454
<i>My son!</i>

33:59.955 --> 34:02.458
Did you wait long?

34:28.692 --> 34:30.485
<i>Jae-min's dad,</i>

34:30.694 --> 34:33.530
bought him a 3DS last week.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.449
That's enough, lie down.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.992
Mom, mom!

34:37.201 --> 34:38.327
Yes, honey?

34:38.494 --> 34:40.370
<i>I want a yogurt.</i>

34:41.080 --> 34:42.998
<i>Your teeth will rot.</i>

34:43.540 --> 34:44.917
<i>- Mom.
- Yeah?</i>

34:45.042 --> 34:47.585
<i>That girl told me,</i>

34:47.710 --> 34:50.547
<i>there are many empty houses,</i>

34:50.672 --> 34:54.760
<i>and beggars hide and live there.</i>

34:54.967 --> 35:00.182
<i>Sometimes living with the family
without permission.</i>

35:00.349 --> 35:01.683
<i>That's nonsense.</i>

35:01.850 --> 35:06.814
<i>That's what she said,
hidden from everyone.</i>

35:24.873 --> 35:25.874
Sung-chul?

38:52.664 --> 38:54.207
Transfer of Inheritance Ownership

39:00.672 --> 39:02.090
It's not fair...
No one believes me...

39:02.215 --> 39:03.425
I have no one around me. So lonely

39:03.592 --> 39:05.969
He's not my brother,
how could do this again...

39:08.597 --> 39:12.309
I loathed father...
I wanted him to die

39:18.857 --> 39:19.941
<i>Father...</i>

39:20.525 --> 39:22.569
<i>do not ignore me.</i>

39:22.694 --> 39:24.654
<i>I am not a ghost.</i>

39:24.780 --> 39:27.407
<i>I am well and alive.</i>

39:27.532 --> 39:32.788
<i>And I'll continue to live
as best as I can.</i>

39:34.623 --> 39:35.957
Good bye.

39:36.124 --> 39:39.795
<i>And one day
I'll show up before you.</i>

39:40.295 --> 39:42.297
<i>I am not a ghost.</i>

39:43.590 --> 39:45.342
- Are you hungry?
- Yup!

39:45.634 --> 39:48.720
- What should we eat for lunch?
- Pizza! I want pizza!

39:49.805 --> 39:52.391
Let's have it with dad and Ho-seh.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.540
<i>The door is opening.</i>

40:16.665 --> 40:17.499
Let's go.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.727
<i>The door is opening.</i>

41:25.233 --> 41:27.027
<i>The elevator is closing.</i>

41:36.036 --> 41:38.914
Mom, why's he carrying umbrella?

41:39.039 --> 41:41.124
Su-ah, quiet!

41:46.463 --> 41:47.923
<i>8th floor.</i>

41:50.091 --> 41:54.137
Pizza, let's get pizza!

42:10.237 --> 42:13.114
Mom, 5880! 5880!

42:26.836 --> 42:29.172
Mom, 3DS!

42:29.297 --> 42:32.050
You promised you'd buy me!

42:32.175 --> 42:33.885
When did I?

42:34.010 --> 42:36.596
You promised last week!

42:36.721 --> 42:38.723
When can I have yogurt?

42:38.848 --> 42:40.559
Ho-seh, remember what I said?

42:40.684 --> 42:43.645
Only if you study 2 hours a day.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.772
- So did you or not?
- I did!

42:45.897 --> 42:48.149
Mom, when's yogurt time?

42:48.316 --> 42:49.985
I didn't see you study,

42:50.318 --> 42:52.821
and yogurt lady's not here yet.

42:53.488 --> 42:56.324
I did! I really did!

42:56.491 --> 42:57.909
Mom!

42:58.034 --> 43:00.745
<i>This is the front,
there's a package for you.</i>

43:00.870 --> 43:01.997
Thank you.

43:07.127 --> 43:10.672
<i>Welcome,
please select from the menu.</i>

43:11.256 --> 43:12.674
Baek Sung-chul

43:13.466 --> 43:15.218
<i>Please take your bank book.</i>

43:20.849 --> 43:22.684
Dongbu Mart.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.737
Hello, I'm here for #805 package.

43:33.862 --> 43:35.780
Right, one moment.

43:36.531 --> 43:39.701
- Here's the package.
- Thank you.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.005
Hello?

43:52.172 --> 43:53.089
Min-ji!

43:53.381 --> 43:54.424
Honey?

43:56.259 --> 43:57.260
Did you lose your phone?

43:57.385 --> 43:58.637
Where are you now? Home?

43:58.762 --> 44:02.057
Now? I'm downstairs for a package.

44:02.182 --> 44:03.808
Get back home! Right away!

44:03.975 --> 44:04.976
What's wrong?

44:05.101 --> 44:08.313
Get home and don't let
anyone in until I get there!

44:08.438 --> 44:09.564
<i>Got it?</i>

44:09.731 --> 44:11.524
- What's going on?
- Hurry!

44:27.082 --> 44:28.500
I'm heading up now.

44:28.625 --> 44:30.877
<i>When do I get yogurt?</i>

44:31.294 --> 44:34.589
Su-ah, will you stop that?

44:34.756 --> 44:36.675
<i>But she's waiting.</i>

44:37.258 --> 44:37.801
What?

44:37.926 --> 44:42.013
The yogurt lady is
waiting outside.

44:42.347 --> 44:44.349
Can't I let her in?

44:44.683 --> 44:48.895
Su-ah, don't open the door!
Wait for me, okay?

44:51.106 --> 44:53.274
It's not the yogurt lady!
Don't open the door!

44:53.400 --> 44:56.403
<i>Just wait for me!</i>

45:08.456 --> 45:11.334
<i>Hello? Hello? Su-ah!</i>

45:11.459 --> 45:13.002
<i>Su-ah! Hello?</i>

45:13.128 --> 45:15.964
Mom, she's knocking.

45:16.464 --> 45:18.633
Is the door locked?

45:18.883 --> 45:19.634
Yeah.

45:19.759 --> 45:21.469
<i>Okay, stay quiet.</i>

45:34.399 --> 45:36.192
<i>Incorrect passcode.</i>

45:38.319 --> 45:40.321
<i>Incorrect passcode.</i>

46:14.105 --> 46:17.942
<i>Kids, are you okay? Hello? Hello?</i>

46:18.359 --> 46:21.529
Mom! I think she's gone.

46:21.821 --> 46:22.697
<i>Yeah?</i>

46:22.822 --> 46:24.199
Should I check?

46:24.365 --> 46:26.284
No! Don't open the door!

47:08.076 --> 47:11.079
Ho-seh, it's mom! It's alright.

47:11.246 --> 47:13.581
- Mom!
- You okay?

47:24.175 --> 47:28.972
Help! Please help us!

47:29.639 --> 47:31.057
Someone help!

47:32.267 --> 47:35.603
Mom! Mom!

47:37.772 --> 47:39.148
Everything okay?

47:57.375 --> 47:59.961
I'm sorry, we'll check the CCTV

48:00.003 --> 48:03.006
and take necessary action.
I'm sorry again.

48:13.349 --> 48:15.852
His face is not visible,

48:16.019 --> 48:18.187
so we can't be sure.

48:18.688 --> 48:20.982
It could be a nutjob,

48:21.107 --> 48:23.610
or someone targeted
your home specifically.

48:25.653 --> 48:29.616
And like you said,
it could be Baek Sung-chul.

48:29.991 --> 48:34.078
3 prior convictions,
including sexual assault.

48:34.370 --> 48:35.663
Report back

48:35.872 --> 48:38.041
- and put out an APB.
- Yes, sir.

48:38.166 --> 48:39.626
- Check his whereabouts.
- Got it.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.482
It's his most recent photo.

49:07.862 --> 49:11.366
Yes, we consulted on these.

49:12.158 --> 49:14.619
Was it February of 2011?

49:14.744 --> 49:17.372
He came in with a document.

49:18.331 --> 49:19.457
A document?

49:19.540 --> 49:21.626
It was a will, your father's.

49:22.001 --> 49:24.003
And he also asked something...

49:24.112 --> 49:25.540
PROOF OF FAMILY RELATIONS

49:25.546 --> 49:27.131
whether he has ownership
over his apartment.

49:29.968 --> 49:31.970
If I remember correctly,

49:32.387 --> 49:35.515
he was the birth child,

49:36.265 --> 49:38.726
and you were adopted.

49:38.851 --> 49:42.563
Here it is, at Pyeongtaek
orphanage till 7, right?

49:42.814 --> 49:46.067
It looked like he felt
wronged for something.

49:48.027 --> 49:50.196
I wouldn't blame all on him,

49:50.571 --> 49:53.032
your father did
leave everything to you,

49:53.992 --> 49:56.369
that's a bit extreme.

49:59.122 --> 49:59.998
Are you okay?

50:00.707 --> 50:03.084
By the way, I received an SMS.

50:03.418 --> 50:05.336
That he can't be
reached for a while.

50:06.921 --> 50:08.881
It was a long time ago.

50:14.554 --> 50:16.097
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

50:16.264 --> 50:18.433
<i>Why did you do it to me?</i>

50:18.599 --> 50:19.934
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

50:20.059 --> 50:22.061
<i>Why did you do it to me?</i>

50:24.397 --> 50:26.190
<i>Why did you do it to me?</i>

50:26.816 --> 50:29.610
<i>Why did you do it to me?
Why did you do it?</i>

50:29.819 --> 50:31.154
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

50:41.205 --> 50:44.000
<i>Did you really see it?</i>

50:45.251 --> 50:45.710
It's okay.

50:45.835 --> 50:48.963
Son of a bitch,
how dare you touch my daughter!

50:49.839 --> 50:51.382
Sung-soo, right?

50:52.967 --> 50:54.886
It's alright, tell me.

50:55.762 --> 50:57.889
You can tell me, what happened?

50:58.014 --> 51:01.976
Tell them,
your brother didn't do anything!

51:02.477 --> 51:05.480
She's the one lying!

51:11.444 --> 51:13.237
You can tell me everything.

51:15.990 --> 51:17.950
Please save us from evil...

51:20.578 --> 51:22.163
It was...

51:23.164 --> 51:24.165
Go on.

51:31.297 --> 51:32.673
It was...

51:33.341 --> 51:34.842
Sung-chul.

51:39.013 --> 51:40.014
It was him.

51:48.231 --> 51:49.357
Bastard!

51:50.650 --> 51:53.903
Why, why did you say that?

51:54.028 --> 51:55.530
You're lying!

51:56.030 --> 51:58.366
Let go! Let go of me!

51:58.866 --> 52:03.830
<i>I didn't do it! Stop lying!</i>

52:13.005 --> 52:17.093
Mom, where's Ho-seh?

53:10.021 --> 53:12.940
<i>#505, 1 man, 1 woman, 1 child.</i>

53:13.107 --> 53:16.110
<i>#404, 1 man, 1 woman, 3 children.</i>

53:16.235 --> 53:18.654
<i>#304, 1 woman, 1 child.</i>

53:25.286 --> 53:27.371
<i>#204, 1 man.</i>

53:31.542 --> 53:33.419
Honey, Ho-seh's missing.

53:34.378 --> 53:35.296
Are you sure?

53:35.421 --> 53:37.131
I was at school,

53:38.382 --> 53:40.384
but he supposedly left early.

53:40.509 --> 53:42.803
<i>He's not home either,
what do I do?</i>

53:42.970 --> 53:43.804
<i>Have you called him?</i>

53:44.180 --> 53:45.640
He's not answering.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.310
<i>Honey, stay calm.</i>

53:49.318 --> 53:50.470
SWITCH TO CCTV FEED

53:50.478 --> 53:52.230
Your son is missing!

53:58.319 --> 54:01.322
Honey, I see him.

54:01.447 --> 54:03.157
<i>Ho-seh, you mean?</i>

54:25.596 --> 54:26.973
Get that guy.

54:28.182 --> 54:29.642
Grab him!

54:33.813 --> 54:35.273
Hey, mister!

54:37.775 --> 54:38.442
Stop!

54:39.443 --> 54:40.027
Stop!

55:15.938 --> 55:18.399
Who are you?
Why are you after my kids?

55:18.899 --> 55:20.026
Who the hell are you?

55:20.151 --> 55:21.444
Ma'am, please calm down.

55:21.569 --> 55:23.029
How can I calm down?

55:26.615 --> 55:28.534
She asked me to wait downstairs.

55:30.077 --> 55:30.995
His story checks out.

55:31.120 --> 55:34.040
No, stop lying to me.

55:34.290 --> 55:37.043
- I know you're lying!
<i>- Don't lie...</i>

55:37.335 --> 55:38.794
<i>Why, why did you do it?</i>

55:38.919 --> 55:43.049
<i>Don't lie... Stop lying...</i>

55:49.305 --> 55:50.264
<i>Ma'am!</i>

55:50.389 --> 55:52.266
<i>- One moment!</i>
- Madame!

55:56.437 --> 55:59.023
You're blowing this
out of proportion.

55:59.148 --> 55:59.982
What?

56:00.191 --> 56:03.444
We cooperated fully
to all of your requests.

56:03.694 --> 56:06.572
Shouldn't you at least
not create a scene?

56:06.739 --> 56:08.032
What did you say?

56:09.742 --> 56:13.079
There weren't any
incidents after that.

56:13.454 --> 56:15.289
The residents are becoming uneasy.

56:15.456 --> 56:16.624
What about the markings?

56:16.999 --> 56:17.875
What?

56:20.252 --> 56:22.963
There are markings
below every doorbell.

56:24.215 --> 56:25.758
I do not...

56:51.325 --> 56:52.618
<i>I'm so sorry,</i>

56:52.743 --> 56:54.954
<i>but could you leave it
at the security office?</i>

56:55.037 --> 56:56.664
But I need recipient's signature.

59:51.005 --> 59:53.048
<i>Why did you do it to me?</i>

59:53.382 --> 59:56.176
<i>Why did you do it to me?
Why did you do it?</i>

59:56.552 --> 59:57.928
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.677
- Mom!
- Mom!

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.307
You son of a bitch!

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.142
What am I suppose to do now?

01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:49.271
What do you want from me? Tell me!

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:52.733
What do you want, son of a bitch!

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.735
Please, stop!

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.738
I've had enough!

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.741
I can't live like this anymore!

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:03.827
I'm taking the kids
back to the States,

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:06.330
do what you feel like!

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.574
Wait, wait a moment.

01:01:45.244 --> 01:01:46.829
Just one moment.

01:01:46.954 --> 01:01:49.498
Have you seen my brother?

01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:51.792
He's still here, right?

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.633
He's nearby.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.135
Where exactly?

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:05.264
Very near, I'm begging you,

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:09.893
please get him to
stop peeping at us.

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:51.698
Who are you?

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:54.826
How do you know my brother?
Where is he?

01:05:57.079 --> 01:05:58.455
Where is he?

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:03.126
Eun-hye, where is she?

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:10.676
Eun-hye...

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:13.303
Who's Eun-hye?

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:17.599
Eun-hye...

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.563
Are you Eun-hye's neighbor?

01:06:35.826 --> 01:06:36.994
Eun-hye?

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:39.746
Yes,

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.666
she's my girlfriend.

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:46.628
Could she be...

01:06:48.547 --> 01:06:49.881
missing by any chance?

01:06:53.093 --> 01:06:57.264
I couldn't reach her suddenly
a few months ago.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.809
We fought over men before,

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.729
but she was always reachable.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:09.776
And then I received
a text message.

01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:13.030
It said she wouldn't be
reached for a while.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.239
Could...

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:17.784
Could I...

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:19.453
see that message?

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:21.121
The text?

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:26.752
Here.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:33.759
She flirts and hooks up
with other men,

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:36.136
if I don't keep an eye on her.

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:39.598
She even changed her lock,

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:43.602
and used my credit card
like crazy.

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:45.729
Credit card?

01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:50.817
I gave it to her for emergency.

01:07:52.194 --> 01:07:54.362
She used it so much that

01:07:54.488 --> 01:07:56.364
I tracked it down.

01:07:56.865 --> 01:07:59.993
And I kept seeing you.

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:16.718
This is Eun-hye's room.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:18.970
What the hell's going on?

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.349
How is this...

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:50.877
What the...

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.124
Who are you?

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:54.793
Pyung-hwa, open the door.

01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:56.336
Please honey, open!

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:57.045
Pyung-hwa!

01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:58.922
Pyung-hwa!

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:01.758
You know me!

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:12.912
Sweetie,

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:14.956
where's your mom?

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:17.292
She went to work.

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:20.628
Demolition Notice

01:12:27.302 --> 01:12:29.429
Are you moving as well?

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:34.267
Yeah, she said we're moving to
a safer place.

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:36.811
- Is the new house decided?
- Yeah.

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:39.105
Mom said it's really cool.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:42.275
So much better than
our old houses.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:47.906
My cell phone.

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:59.376
I have to call the police
and report that man.

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:03.171
This is mine,

01:13:03.797 --> 01:13:04.964
right?

01:13:05.507 --> 01:13:09.135
My daughter gave me
that as a present.

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:12.013
Give it back, please.

01:13:17.185 --> 01:13:19.312
Mine! it's mine!

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:20.730
Don't take it from me!

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:24.192
It's mine! Give it back!

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:26.486
Okay, fine.

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:29.989
Here.

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:41.251
Sweetie, could I use your phone?

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:09.362
Pyung-hwa

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:11.364
are those...

01:14:13.575 --> 01:14:14.993
Yeah, they're all mine.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.039
Here.

01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:31.009
Pyung-hwa.

01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:32.510
Yeah?

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:34.220
Where...

01:14:37.015 --> 01:14:38.057
did you get this?

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:39.893
That's mom's.

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:42.145
What?

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:43.605
Huh?

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:53.323
This is our new house,
cool, isn't it?

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.576
<i>I don't like carrots.</i>

01:14:57.035 --> 01:14:58.570
<i>I don't like carrots.</i>

01:14:58.578 --> 01:14:59.787
PYUNG-HWA'S HOME

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:02.582
<i>I don't like carrots.</i>

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.335
<i>But, I like mom.</i>

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.836
But, I like mom.

01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:45.291
<i>Please get him to stop
peeping at my child.</i>

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:48.461
<i>I can't sleep at night
because of him.</i>

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:52.215
<i>He's driving me crazy!</i>

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.466
Sung-chul...

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.511
It's mom.

01:15:58.513 --> 01:16:01.266
Mom

01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:14.862
It looks like someone
lived here after his death.

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:17.156
<i>Probably a vagrant,</i>

01:16:17.282 --> 01:16:18.533
<i>I feel bad for the deceased.</i>

01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:22.078
Are we moving again?

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:30.962
Who...

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:45.852
<i>Come out! Open this goddamn door!</i>

01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:47.729
<i>You worthless shit!</i>

01:16:47.854 --> 01:16:49.856
<i>You thought I wouldn't find out?</i>

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:53.484
<i>Too bad for you,
I recorded everything!</i>

01:16:53.693 --> 01:16:57.113
<i>I'm gonna call the cops,
you're fucked now!</i>

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:00.617
No, this is my house.

01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:04.495
This is my house.

01:17:10.043 --> 01:17:11.878
You're finished!

01:17:18.009 --> 01:17:20.011
Mom, it's mine, right?

01:17:22.013 --> 01:17:23.556
Pack your things, honey.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:27.644
We're moving to
a much better house.

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:32.649
Yeah.

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:37.153
I'll send the kids first,
so please take care of them.

01:17:37.737 --> 01:17:39.822
Mom, we're really going back?

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:41.574
We are, pack your toys.

01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:45.912
I'll have to convince him,
or I'll just fly out by myself.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.419
Serona Mart credit card used - $12

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:08.101
Don't do that,
I haven't paid for it yet.

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:10.436
It's alright, is it good?

01:18:10.978 --> 01:18:12.939
Yes, it's delicious.

01:18:13.398 --> 01:18:14.982
Mom, I want chocolate.

01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:18.319
Okay, hurry now.

01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:20.071
Her pronunciation is wonderful.

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:25.993
There're no big markets nearby?

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:26.953
No.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.782
MIN-JI

01:18:28.783 --> 01:18:31.283
I see. That's a pity.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:34.001
Mom, do we have to go now?

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.003
- Don't.
- It's cold out.

01:18:36.129 --> 01:18:38.172
- I said don't.
- Ho-seh, stop it.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:39.382
Mom, hold on.

01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:43.636
Mom, my head really hurts.

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.596
I got your medicine.

01:18:45.972 --> 01:18:48.141
Let's take the staircase instead.

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:53.521
- Mom, scold Ho-seh.
- Okay, honey, I will.

01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:54.731
Ho-she!

01:18:56.816 --> 01:18:58.484
<i>You should talk to the manager.</i>

01:18:58.609 --> 01:18:59.777
<i>It's really strange.</i>

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:03.448
I can't contact him,
it's been a week now.

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:05.324
Let me just check.

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:10.163
Please, let me peep inside.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:13.583
Mister, can't you see I'm busy?

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.752
You can't stop me every time.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:18.755
<i>But you can't just ignore
our protocol.</i>

01:19:19.005 --> 01:19:20.923
<i>When did I do that?</i>

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:23.092
<i>- The last time...</i>
- Pyung-hwa.

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:24.469
Come along.

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:30.141
You don't have to be
a prick about it.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.185
Do you think I like doing this?

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:35.104
Mom, that dog's so cute!

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:37.565
Yeah? Should we get one too?

01:19:37.732 --> 01:19:40.026
Really? Can we get a puppy?

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.487
It's cold, let's go inside.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:45.823
Should we get pizza for dinner?

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.617
Pizza! Pizza!

01:20:04.592 --> 01:20:07.303
Mom, she's weird.

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:10.640
Su-ah.

01:20:13.518 --> 01:20:14.936
She's burning up.

01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:30.076
Ho-seh, I'll be right back.

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:32.453
Lock the doors,
and stay put, okay?

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:33.681
I'm sorry Sung-chul.

01:22:41.415 --> 01:22:43.709
Min-ji, are you okay?

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.127
<i>Is that you?</i>

01:22:45.378 --> 01:22:48.506
What's going on?
I've been calling you.

01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:51.634
Listen to me carefully.

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:54.804
It's her.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:56.263
Who?

01:22:56.389 --> 01:22:58.891
That woman we saw
at my brother's apartment.

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:00.434
What about her?

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:02.311
She killed him.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:03.938
What?

01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:06.190
She killed my brother.

01:23:07.066 --> 01:23:09.527
She took everything,

01:23:10.111 --> 01:23:14.824
my wallet, card key,
and my cell phone.

01:23:17.535 --> 01:23:18.244
Where're the kids?

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:22.748
They're with me.

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:27.253
Good, call the police,
I'll come right away.

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:30.297
But leave the house
immediately, okay?

01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:35.154
Pyung-hwa! Come out now.

01:24:42.745 --> 01:24:44.497
Mom, closet's huge!

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:49.376
Yes?

01:24:49.502 --> 01:24:50.836
<i>Don't forget tomorrow's
community meeting.</i>

01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:53.464
Of course, see you then.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:54.423
<i>Bye!</i>

01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:12.942
Ho-seh, why isn't mom back?

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:19.198
Should I call her?

01:25:30.584 --> 01:25:31.877
Mom,

01:25:33.838 --> 01:25:37.216
where are you? Su-ah woke up.

01:25:37.383 --> 01:25:38.884
Hurry back.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.423
Hey kids, you must be
Ho-seh and Su-ah.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:19.383
Remember me?

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:24.597
I guess not.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:30.644
Your mom had to go
take care of something,

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:33.355
she asked me to
look after you two.

01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:34.982
What?

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:39.403
She'll be back soon,
let's wait at my house.

01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:41.155
Come on.

01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:46.785
Won't you open?

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:49.580
Miss,

01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:53.000
that's my mom's coat.

01:26:57.796 --> 01:26:59.924
What are you saying?

01:27:00.466 --> 01:27:02.635
Where did you get it?

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:05.137
Did mom give it to you?

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:07.473
This coat is mine,

01:27:07.765 --> 01:27:09.225
it's mine.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:11.143
Miss,

01:27:11.644 --> 01:27:13.229
where is my mom?

01:27:14.104 --> 01:27:16.941
Open this door, and talk.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:20.069
Open the door.

01:27:21.278 --> 01:27:22.905
Open it!

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.282
- Just look at this!
- Are you nuts?

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:26.867
- What?
- Nuts!

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:29.828
I got you, I'm gonna get the cops.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:32.498
- I'll put you in jail.
- Cops my ass...

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:43.509
Come on kids!
Why are you in my car?

01:27:43.676 --> 01:27:44.843
- Come on!
- No,

01:27:44.969 --> 01:27:47.513
this is our car!

01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:52.851
You kids got it all wrong,
this is my car.

01:28:09.285 --> 01:28:10.119
Come here!

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:13.038
Go!

01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:37.271
Help us!

01:28:38.272 --> 01:28:40.774
Help us!

01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:43.485
<i>Dad!</i>

01:28:44.236 --> 01:28:46.405
<i>Someone help!</i>

01:29:18.437 --> 01:29:19.355
Let's go!

01:30:13.826 --> 01:30:14.993
Open this door!

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:55.826
Mom!

01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:10.757
Dad!

01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:04.811
Min-ji, Min-ji!

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:06.146
Min-ji!

01:32:06.605 --> 01:32:07.981
Mom!

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.609
Mom!

01:32:11.318 --> 01:32:12.528
You okay?

01:32:13.445 --> 01:32:15.113
Mom!

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.616
Mom!

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:32.649
No!

01:34:14.483 --> 01:34:15.817
Ho-seh...

01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:50.185
Children!

01:34:51.061 --> 01:34:52.104
Come out here.

01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:55.440
Now!

01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:57.651
Right this second!

01:34:57.943 --> 01:35:00.153
I'm so sick of this! Seriously!

01:35:09.246 --> 01:35:11.832
They're all smashed.

01:35:12.332 --> 01:35:14.543
I can't use these anymore.

01:35:17.546 --> 01:35:18.964
<i>Look at that!</i>

01:35:19.589 --> 01:35:22.175
You rascals ruined
my beautiful home!

01:35:33.812 --> 01:35:35.147
it's my home from now on.

01:35:35.355 --> 01:35:37.065
No one can touch anything.

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.904
I gotta buy new knickknacks,
and paint the walls too.

01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:45.657
Expand the sink a bit.

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:48.118
<i>A new set of sofa too.</i>

01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:39.544
<i>Stop!</i>

01:36:44.216 --> 01:36:45.258
Drop that,

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:48.345
please drop it.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:50.639
This is my home! You hear me?

01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:53.266
I hear you,

01:36:53.767 --> 01:36:55.393
we'll leave,

01:36:56.186 --> 01:36:57.354
you can live here.

01:36:57.687 --> 01:36:58.230
Just...

01:36:59.439 --> 01:37:01.733
Just let my family leave,

01:37:02.859 --> 01:37:04.486
and it's all yours.

01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:07.656
Don't lie!

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.366
I'm gonna burn everything!

01:37:09.491 --> 01:37:10.784
No, don't!

01:37:11.409 --> 01:37:13.203
Don't...

01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:18.792
Let my family walk out.

01:37:25.549 --> 01:37:26.883
I'm not lying to you.

01:37:35.433 --> 01:37:38.603
This home, you can have it,

01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:40.313
we'll...

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:43.108
we'll leave peacefully.

01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:53.201
<i>Police!</i>

01:38:06.965 --> 01:38:10.302
Die! Please die!

01:38:15.307 --> 01:38:18.226
It's mine, my home!

01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:23.940
No! It's ours! Stop it!

01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:25.942
It's my home!

01:38:26.318 --> 01:38:28.028
No, it's not!

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.571
Mine!

01:38:30.906 --> 01:38:32.407
It's mine!

01:38:32.574 --> 01:38:36.369
Why are you doing this to me?
What did I do?

01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:39.372
What did my daughter do to you?

01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:47.756
No.

01:38:48.882 --> 01:38:52.427
Not this house! Please, no!

01:38:58.183 --> 01:38:59.476
No!

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:02.938
Please!

01:39:03.772 --> 01:39:05.732
No! Help!

01:39:08.944 --> 01:39:10.487
No! No!

01:39:10.946 --> 01:39:13.031
Please!

01:39:21.247 --> 01:39:24.125
My house...

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:08.837
- Mom!
- Mom!

01:40:21.558 --> 01:40:22.767
Min-ji!

01:40:23.226 --> 01:40:24.602
Wake up! Min-ji!

01:40:24.769 --> 01:40:26.855
Honey, wake up!

01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:06.728
Rest in Peace Baek Sung-chul

01:41:21.493 --> 01:41:24.829
We'll arrive at 11 a.m.

01:41:25.038 --> 01:41:26.331
Yeah, local time.

01:41:29.042 --> 01:41:31.503
Mom, we're leaving now.

01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:38.259
You sure it's safe there?

01:41:50.647 --> 01:41:52.941
<i>This place was a bargain.</i>

01:41:53.233 --> 01:41:56.194
It's okay, the neighborhood
seems pretty good.

01:41:56.569 --> 01:41:58.905
Yeah, you know.

01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:01.324
Stop running around, settle down!

01:42:01.491 --> 01:42:04.285
- In the living room please.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:42:04.536 --> 01:42:06.204
Yeah, of course.

01:42:06.996 --> 01:42:10.458
<i>Honey! I told you
not to go up there.</i>

01:42:13.294 --> 01:42:16.548
<i>It's so much better than
where we lived before.</i>

01:42:27.225 --> 01:42:29.477
<i>There's a weird rumor</i>

01:42:30.019 --> 01:42:32.730
<i>going around in my neighborhood.</i>

01:42:34.274 --> 01:42:40.280
<i>It's about squatters hiding in others'
homes, and secretly living there.</i>

01:42:41.781 --> 01:42:47.328
<i>And they settle down
and take the owner's place.</i>

01:42:48.788 --> 01:42:52.584
<i>Just like baby owls.</i>
