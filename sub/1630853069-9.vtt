WEBVTT

00:06.806 --> 00:07.073
Recognize this?

00:11.578 --> 00:13.880
-Yeah, it's fucking badass.
-Yeah.

00:13.980 --> 00:14.981
I'm sorry?

00:15.048 --> 00:15.648
Uh, do you have
a translator?

00:15.715 --> 00:17.984
I have very
little English.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.987
I also don't speak
English as well.

00:23.256 --> 00:26.893
I didn't even realize
there was piracy happening.

00:26.993 --> 00:30.030
Don't know anything
about any of this

00:30.096 --> 00:30.930
or any of the people involved.

00:31.031 --> 00:35.268
The Captain isn't...
that strong a swordsman

00:35.368 --> 00:38.405
or seaman or anything,
to be honest.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.942
I'm a strong reader/writer,
so both, double threat.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.244
In case you're hiring
after all of this.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.112
Hmm.

00:47.013 --> 00:50.417
(jaunty melody playing)

00:51.451 --> 00:53.286
Admiral Chauncey Badminton:
Mr. Bonnet...

00:54.387 --> 00:56.456
Welcome.

00:56.556 --> 00:59.592
No, no, no, no, no, no... no.

00:59.692 --> 01:00.794
Everything all right?

01:01.728 --> 01:04.931
Chauncey... Oh, yes.

01:05.031 --> 01:09.102
I forgot you were twins.
I, I mean, are twins.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.937
(low growl)

01:11.037 --> 01:14.941
And h-how is
your brother, Nigel?
Is he... Is he well?

01:15.041 --> 01:17.977
As a matter of fact,
Nigel's decidedly... unwell.

01:21.548 --> 01:22.816
But I think you know that.

01:23.716 --> 01:24.951
How would I know that?

01:25.051 --> 01:27.053
I, I, I haven't
seen him in ages.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.457
I have it on very good
authority that he was
onboard this vessel...

01:31.624 --> 01:33.159
in your company.

01:33.259 --> 01:37.497
No, no, I--
I don't know where
you would've heard that.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.466
I heard it from the witnesses...

01:42.168 --> 01:43.570
to his murder.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.138
(gasping)

01:48.675 --> 01:52.312
Sweetie...
why're you holding
yourself like that?

01:52.412 --> 01:56.316
-Nervous tummy?
-They're lookin'
for Stede's journal.

01:56.416 --> 01:59.686
-For evidence.
-There's nothin' we can do
about that now. He's done for.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.820
(whispers):
I have Stede's journal.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.355
I grabbed it
when we got boarded.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.424
-You gotta get
rid of that, babe!
-I know that, babe,

02:04.491 --> 02:07.127
but I can't get to the side
of the ship to throw it over.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.128
Ay, give it here.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.831
No, trust me.
I was born for this
kind of espionage.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.300
Awesome. Do it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go, go, go, go, go.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.303
-Okay.
-Roach, I need a distraction.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.475
(mischievous music playing)

02:24.944 --> 02:28.014
What's your problem, darkie?

02:28.648 --> 02:29.949
Your face?

02:31.017 --> 02:32.185
-(laughing)
-Get him!

02:32.285 --> 02:35.622
-Distraction's away!
Go, go, go, go, go!
-Go, Frenchie!

02:36.122 --> 02:37.857
Fuckin' hell.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.692
Sailor:
Hello.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.195
What's this?

02:42.295 --> 02:43.997
(whimpers)

02:44.063 --> 02:46.699
"My Wondrous Journey:
A Life at Sea."

02:46.799 --> 02:50.470
Bit of fan fiction...
about Captain Bonnet.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.539
You're a fan
of your Captain?

02:52.639 --> 02:54.874
Yeah, yeah. Huge fan.

02:54.974 --> 02:59.746
Can't stop imagining him
in all different scenarios.
All totally made up.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.649
"A true journal
of the life and happenings
of Stede Bonnet."

03:02.715 --> 03:06.386
Bonnet, yeah.
Mm, it was written
to resemble a journal.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.922
It's a kind of grabby
marketing hook till
I get the reader--

03:09.022 --> 03:10.823
Oh, found a good bit?
What part?

03:10.890 --> 03:13.359
Would love some,
some feedback.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.161
I'd like to take it, actually.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.731
Get back!

03:21.000 --> 03:23.169
"'Avast ye!' I snapped.

03:23.236 --> 03:27.073
"The smell of death
permeated the room,
electric in its tang.

03:27.173 --> 03:31.377
"'P-p-p-please
don't kill me!'
Nigel whined...

03:32.512 --> 03:34.013
having soiled himself."

03:34.080 --> 03:35.348
(slams book shut)

03:36.683 --> 03:37.083
Course, I don't
believe any of it.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.353
Oh, thank god.

03:42.855 --> 03:45.091
Blackbeard confessed
to the crime moments ago.

03:46.759 --> 03:50.530
-He did?
-Yep. I killed the bastard.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.732
-Enjoyed it, too.
-Right.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.134
And what did
he look like?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.804
All of you.
You all look the same, you know?

03:57.904 --> 04:01.608
-And how did you kill him?
-Ah, the ushe. Uh, stabbing.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.876
-And where did you stab him?
-Everywhere.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.745
I don't keep track
of these kinds of things.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.381
You know, I'm a...
"life is cheap" kind of guy.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.317
That's not true.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.220
Why would he lie?

04:15.755 --> 04:17.223
Honestly, it makes
much more sense.
After all...

04:19.659 --> 04:21.461
you're just some
bored little rich boy.

04:21.561 --> 04:26.165
You weak-hearted,
lily-livered little rich boy.

04:26.266 --> 04:31.504
And that's all you'll
ever be, Stede Bonnet.

04:35.808 --> 04:36.276
I did it.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.114
I'm sorry?

04:41.180 --> 04:44.784
I... murdered Nigel.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.153
Stole his sword, and I--

04:49.322 --> 04:50.657
jammed it through his head.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.762
(shuddering breaths)
I killed him.

04:58.498 --> 04:59.832
(Captain Stede cries)

05:02.435 --> 05:04.837
You'll sign a confession
to that extent, hm?

05:04.937 --> 05:08.041
(melancholy music playing)

05:09.609 --> 05:10.810
(cries)

05:10.877 --> 05:13.179
There's a good chap.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.048
There, there,
Baby Bonnet.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.182
Feels better,
doesn't it?

05:16.282 --> 05:21.321
Officer Wellington:
Ready. Aim. Fire!

05:21.387 --> 05:23.790
-(pirates yelling)
-Oh dear.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.359
(clamoring)

05:26.459 --> 05:28.294
(banging gavel)

05:31.331 --> 05:32.198
In the name of His Majesty,
King George,

05:32.298 --> 05:34.901
this tribunal shall
come to order.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.237
Edward Teach...

05:38.338 --> 05:41.741
-or "Black Beard."
-It's just "Blackbeard."

05:41.841 --> 05:43.042
Like, just run it
together as one word.
"Blackbeard."

05:43.142 --> 05:45.478
Don't have to put
a gap in there.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.679
You face death...

05:46.746 --> 05:49.248
for general crimes
of piracy against the Crown.

05:50.183 --> 05:50.249
Yeah.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.921
But a friend of the Crown
has prevailed upon me

05:55.021 --> 05:57.023
to remand you
to his custody.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.526
You shall be released
to Captain Hands

06:00.593 --> 06:03.229
in exchange for his
service to the King.

06:03.329 --> 06:04.897
(crew booing)

06:04.997 --> 06:06.532
Roach:
How he still alive, anyway?

06:06.599 --> 06:08.501
-The Swede: Traitor!
-He gave us up.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.336
-(banging gavel)
-Admiral Badminton: Order.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.872
Stede Bonnet...

06:13.940 --> 06:17.410
for the wanton murder
of Nigel Badminton...

06:20.780 --> 06:21.881
your sentence is death...

06:23.349 --> 06:24.717
by firing squad.

06:24.784 --> 06:25.351
(crew gasps)

06:29.389 --> 06:30.523
We'll find a way
out of this, okay?

06:30.590 --> 06:33.259
-Ed, no. No, I deserve this.
-We'll come up with a plan.

06:35.294 --> 06:38.531
At some point in a man's life,
he has to face the music.

06:38.598 --> 06:39.599
For the things he's done...

06:39.699 --> 06:41.100
(laughs)

06:41.200 --> 06:41.267
(Captain Stede grunts)

06:44.070 --> 06:45.471
and the people he's hurt.

06:49.709 --> 06:50.743
It's time, Ed.

06:52.278 --> 06:53.913
The bill has come due.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.582
-(rifles cocking)
-Oh my god!

06:56.649 --> 06:58.551
I don't wanna die!

06:58.618 --> 06:59.786
Oh god!

06:59.886 --> 07:00.987
Oh please!
(tearful pleading)

07:01.087 --> 07:04.056
-Hey, boss.
-Edward...

07:04.123 --> 07:06.292
I know you're upset,
but it was the only--

07:06.392 --> 07:07.627
(grunts)

07:07.727 --> 07:09.962
-Very nice, very nice.
-Great punch, Cap'n.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.631
-Great punch.
-Izzy: Okay... that's fair.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.800
That's fair.

07:16.135 --> 07:19.772
Remember though,
you said when you
made me first mate,

07:19.839 --> 07:21.841
"Above all else
is loyalty
to your Captain."

07:21.941 --> 07:24.143
Rifles at the ready!

07:24.243 --> 07:26.779
-Oh god.
-Izzy: You're my captain...

07:26.846 --> 07:28.347
and I was never gonna
stand by and let you

07:28.448 --> 07:31.184
destroy yourself
for that... twat.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.920
And this, this is
a humane way of ending it.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.655
-Aim!
-Izzy: It's quick. It's clean.

07:35.755 --> 07:36.789
Oh shit.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.458
Izzy:
Edward, you know that.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.626
(shouts):
Act of Grace!

07:40.693 --> 07:43.162
No... No.

07:43.262 --> 07:44.630
Blackbeard:
Act of Grace!

07:47.266 --> 07:48.935
Act of Grace!

07:49.001 --> 07:50.036
-Say it. Say "Act of Grace!"
-What?!

07:50.136 --> 07:53.439
Crew (shouting):
Act of Grace!

07:53.506 --> 07:54.474
Grace!

07:54.540 --> 07:55.608
What he said!

07:56.776 --> 07:59.178
Fuck me.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.013
What's the Act of Grace?

08:01.113 --> 08:05.184
I, King George,
do hereby proclaim

08:05.284 --> 08:10.356
that any pyrate who so
abandons his life of crime

08:10.456 --> 08:15.795
and pledges service
to the Crown in their war
against the Spanish...

08:16.863 --> 08:19.866
shall be granted
amnesty forthwith.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.501
And we're calling this?

08:24.504 --> 08:28.474
Ah, yes, uh, call it
my Act of Kindness.

08:28.541 --> 08:31.711
Nope! Uh, my Act of Charity.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.379
No!

08:34.180 --> 08:39.151
King George's Act of Grace.

08:39.218 --> 08:43.656
No, wait! No, use that.
That's great. (chuckles)

08:43.723 --> 08:45.591
Overthinking things as usual.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.993
Admiral Badminton:
So...

08:47.059 --> 08:48.394
you want to go
to war for the King?

08:48.494 --> 08:52.164
We'd rather eat our
own faces, but yes.

08:52.231 --> 08:53.900
Two Acts of Grace, please.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.403
Ah...

08:57.503 --> 09:00.940
I'm afraid the offer doesn't
extend to you, Bonnet.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.844
After all, the King was
only referring to real pirates.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.347
He's from my world,
not yours.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.718
Raise your rifles!

09:12.785 --> 09:14.587
Ah!
Put the blindfold back on.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.255
"June the third.
An excellent day!

09:16.355 --> 09:18.291
"Raided a commercial vessel

09:18.391 --> 09:21.060
"after overwhelming
the hardy crew.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.930
We claimed a prize of lush
vegetation in conquest."

09:24.030 --> 09:26.265
Here's an illustration
for reference.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.600
And here's
the vegetation
in question.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.804
"They'll never forget
the Eccentric Pirate Bonnet

09:31.904 --> 09:34.106
and his savage, insane,
vengeful pirate horde."

09:34.206 --> 09:36.442
-See? He's a pirate.
A real, proper pirate.
-Oluwande: A proper pirate.

09:36.542 --> 09:40.947
That man is a fearsome
pirate if e'er I seen one.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.448
Ya great foppin' twats!

09:42.548 --> 09:45.251
Oluwande:
Yeah, he's definitely
a pirate.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.486
(crew agreeing)

09:47.587 --> 09:51.724
Well, rule-of-law-wise,
I'd say that settles it.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.459
A plant and a drawing?

09:53.559 --> 09:57.229
-Settles nothing.
-It's enough for us.

09:57.296 --> 10:01.500
Blackbeard renounces
piracy to serve the Crown?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.603
(chuckles)
We'll be dining with
Ol' King George himself.

10:05.905 --> 10:06.772
Why?

10:06.839 --> 10:11.277
Why do you all show
such loyalty to this...

10:11.344 --> 10:14.080
this... nothing?

10:14.146 --> 10:19.185
I'd attribute quite a lot
of it to a people-positive
management style.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.587
-Shut up!
-Officer Wellington:
Stand down, Admiral.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.023
Or we'll be forced
to take measures.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.293
Measures?!
Against me?!

10:29.295 --> 10:31.163
-He's the criminal!
-All right!

10:31.263 --> 10:34.033
-He's the murderer!
-Calm down, Mr. Wavy Blade.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.502
Blackbeard:
Give it a break, mate.
You're freakin' us all out.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.538
Chauncey, sometimes,
when we get a bit angry,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.140
do you know what
we like to do?

10:42.942 --> 10:45.277
-We talk it through...
-Crew: As a crew!

10:45.344 --> 10:49.015
-Yes.
-Oh, I know.

10:49.115 --> 10:52.051
I know what's happened.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.655
Yeah, we've somehow drifted
south of the equator,

10:55.721 --> 10:58.991
and ended up
in Backwardsland!
Get your hands off me!

10:59.058 --> 11:02.461
-(indistinct shouting)
-Do you know who I am?

11:02.528 --> 11:05.731
-I am an Admiral!
-(sword clattering)

11:07.299 --> 11:09.635
I'll have you all executed!

11:09.702 --> 11:12.638
-(Admiral shouting)
-Poor bugger.

11:12.705 --> 11:13.572
Admiral Badminton!

11:15.675 --> 11:19.378
-Oh shit. Damn.
-That's a big document.

11:19.478 --> 11:20.880
