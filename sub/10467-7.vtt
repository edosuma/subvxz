I WOULDN'T WANT TO SIT
NEXT TO HER ANYWAY.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.177
SHE'S STUPID!

19:38.177 --> 19:39.613
HEY! NOW,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.658
IT'S NOT FAIR.
I NEVER GET ANYTHING!

19:41.658 --> 19:45.053
HEY, I JUST SHELLED OUT
20 BUCKS FOR YOU
FOR THOSE LURES.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.273
I WANNA SEE THE MOVIE!
I WANNA SEE THE MOVIE!

19:47.273 --> 19:49.449

19:55.106 --> 19:58.806
FROM NOW ON, I WANT YOU
TO GO TO THE FARMERS MARKET
AND CHECK OUT THE PRODUCE, OK?

19:58.806 --> 20:02.070
I DON'T WANT ANY MELONS
YOU HAVEN'T SQUEEZED YOURSELF.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.074
EXCUSE ME A SECOND, OK?

20:08.859 --> 20:12.646
HI, SEAN.
HOW ARE YOU?

20:12.646 --> 20:16.780
HOW AM I?
I'M ALWAYS THE SAME,
TRYING TO MAKE MY WAY

20:16.780 --> 20:19.609
IN A TOUGH,
DOG-EAT-DOG BUSINESS.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.612
I'M FINE.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

20:22.612 --> 20:25.311
HOW ABOUT YOU?I'M--

20:25.311 --> 20:27.226
HOW THE HELL OLD
ARE YOU ANYWAY, BAILEY?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.140
WHAT, 25, 26?

20:29.140 --> 20:31.404
I'M 20, ACTUALLY.

20:31.404 --> 20:34.407
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN
A LITTLE OVER YOUR HEAD?

20:34.407 --> 20:36.235
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:36.235 --> 20:39.412
I KNOW TWO THINGS:
I KNOW I JUST LOST
ALIX KORIE

20:39.412 --> 20:41.327
TO YOUR FRIEND
AT THE FAIRPORT.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.633
NOW I HEAR THAT
THE ANTIQUE GUILD IS
BIDDING AGAINST ME

20:43.633 --> 20:45.896
FOR THE SPACE
ACROSS THE STREET.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.681
ARE THOSE
YOUR FRIENDS, TOO?

20:49.552 --> 20:51.946
UM...WELL...

20:51.946 --> 20:55.950
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
BE PLAYING THIS, BAILEY?

20:55.950 --> 21:00.694
LIKE YOU SAID, IT GETS
KIND OF DOG-EAT-DOG SOMETIMES.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.566
JUST A QUESTION
OF WHO BITES WHO.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.569
COME BY ANYTIME.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.801
GREAT, LIKE MY DAY
WASN'T GOING BAD ENOUGH.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.281
LOOK...

21:22.281 --> 21:25.109
I KNOW YOU NEED
AN EXPLANATION.

21:25.109 --> 21:28.199
AN EXPLANATION?
AN APOLOGY.

21:28.199 --> 21:31.028
I'M SORRY.

21:31.028 --> 21:33.117
WHO ARE YOU, NED?

21:33.117 --> 21:36.338
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY
OBVIOUS I DON'T KNOW
YOU AT ALL.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.949
I MEAN IT TURNS OUT
YOU'RE A REALLY
GOOD LIAR,

21:38.949 --> 21:40.473
WHICH I SHOULD HAVE
FIGURED OUT WITH HOW
YOU DEALT WITH MAGGIE.

21:40.473 --> 21:43.476
AND THEN--
AND HERE'S
A BIG SURPRISE,

21:43.476 --> 21:45.260
YOU TURN OUT TO BE
A GUY WHO'S ASHAMED
OF HIS OWN BROTHER.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.218
I'M NOT ASHAMED
OF RICHIE.

21:47.218 --> 21:50.700
I LOVE MY BROTHER.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.833
UH HUH, WHICH IS WHY
YOU REALLY WANTED
ME TO MEET HIM.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.314
IT WASN'T HIM I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO MEET,

21:55.314 --> 21:58.882
IT WAS THEM, MY PARENTS.

21:58.882 --> 22:00.754
IT'S JUST--

22:00.754 --> 22:02.799
IT'S ALL
SCREWED UP, OK?

22:02.799 --> 22:06.150
THE TRUTH IS,
I'VE GOT THIS MISERABLE
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM,

22:06.150 --> 22:11.678
AND I CAN'T--I MEAN IT'S
HARD ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THEM.

22:11.678 --> 22:15.508
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, JULIA.

22:15.508 --> 22:16.987
IT'S, LIKE, YOU KIND OF
HAVE TO BE THERE,

22:16.987 --> 22:18.685
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO
SEE IT FOR YOURSELF.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.817
WHICH YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T WANT ME TO DO.

22:20.817 --> 22:24.647
OK, FINE. YOU WANT
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'M DEALING WITH?

22:24.647 --> 22:28.172
YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT IT'S LIKE,
WHAT THEY'RE LIKE.

AND THE STUFF SHE NEEDS
IS THE KIND OF STUFF
YOU GOTTA DO RIGHT AWAY.

24:44.134 --> 24:48.443
LIKE PICK HER UP

MR. SALINGER,
YOU'RE UNDERAGE,
YOU'RE SOLICITING ALCOHOL,

AND IF YOU DON'T
COME WITH ME VOLUNTARILY,

26:21.231 --> 26:23.582
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
PLACE YOU UNDER ARREST.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.864

IT'S A GAME

26:44.864 --> 26:47.431
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ACTING LIKE A COUPLE
OF FIFTH-GRADERS.

YOU'RE GOING TO END UP

IT SOUND LIKE THEY
MIGHT EVEN KICK YOU OUT.

FOR A SMOKE BOMB?

28:00.113 --> 28:02.898

OH.WELL, JULIA DIDN'T CHOOSE HER.

28:44.505 --> 28:47.247

ABOUT THIS STUFF, NED.

YOU TALKING ABOUT--
NO MAN'S SHIFT?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.706
I'M ON FOR 4 HOURS,
THEN YOU'RE ON FOR 4 HOURS,

31:22.706 --> 31:26.623
AND THEN WE SORT OF OVERLAP
AND "GO WITH THE FLOW"
THING FOR 4 HOURS.

31:26.623 --> 31:29.061
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
TALKING ABOUT THIS
LAST NIGHT?

31:31.802 --> 31:33.282

HOW'D YOU--?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.072
SHH.

31:40.072 --> 31:42.074
I PUT HER
TO SLEEP.

31:42.074 --> 31:46.034
YOU SURE DID,
BUDDY.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.907
Daphne: I'M GOING TO
PUT HER DOWN UPSTAIRS,

31:51.866 --> 31:53.520
AND THEN I'M
COMING BACK,

31:53.520 --> 31:56.479
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
TELL ME YOUR SECRET, OK?

31:56.479 --> 31:57.698
OK.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.529
THAT WAS HELPING, HUH?

32:02.529 --> 32:06.707
ARE YOU KIDDING?
BIG TIME.

32:09.275 --> 32:13.975
SO, NOW CAN
WE PLAY HEARTS?

32:13.975 --> 32:15.020
WHAT?

32:15.020 --> 32:17.805
OH, OWEN, GEE I--

32:19.850 --> 32:22.331
SURE. SURE WE CAN.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.948
YOU KNOW, LAST TIME
I PLAYED WITH KIRSTEN,

32:29.948 --> 32:34.387
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW
TO SHOOT THE MOON,
BUT I FORGOT.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.956
CHARLIE.

32:42.438 --> 32:45.572
Ned: THAT WASN'T
EVEN A PARTICULARLY
GOOD PERFORMANCE.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.835
I GIVE HIM
A "B-" AT BEST.

32:51.143 --> 32:58.933
I GUESS...I GUESS
HE HAD ALL THESE
EXPECTATIONS FOR HIS KIDS.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.848
AND THEN RICHIE CAME,

33:00.848 --> 33:05.853
AND DAD WILL BE LUCKY
IF RICHIE WILL MOVE
OUT OF THE HOUSE

33:05.853 --> 33:09.900
OR IF HE CAN GET ON
A BUS BY HIMSELF.

WORLD-FAMOUS HEART
SURGEON IS KIND OF
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

33:15.515 --> 33:19.301

I'M HIS ONLY HOPE.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.087
NED...

33:22.087 --> 33:26.830
BUT I FIGURED OUT
A WAY TO DEAL WITH
ALL THE PRESSURE.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.877
NOW I ACTUALLY
LOOK FOR THINGS
TO DISAPPOINT HIM.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.579
WHEN SHE CAME TO
STANFORD WITH ME,

33:36.579 --> 33:38.929
I THOUGHT HE WAS
GOING TO HAVE A STROKE.

33:38.929 --> 33:42.150
I SWEAR TO GOD, I STAYED
WITH HER FOR TWO YEARS

33:42.150 --> 33:45.762
JUST HOPING THAT
HE WOULD GIVE UP
ON ME ALTOGETHER.

33:45.762 --> 33:46.894

AND GRADUATED SUMMA.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.474
HE'S GOT IT ALL
IN HIS HEAD.

HE CAN SEE ME UP THERE
WITH MY CAP AND GOWN

34:05.173 --> 34:07.001

34:07.001 --> 34:10.309
I'VE GOT HIM
SO CLOSE HE CAN
PRACTICALLY TASTE IT.

34:10.309 --> 34:13.094
BUT THE PROBLEM
FOR HIM IS

34:13.094 --> 34:17.229
I'M NOT GOING TO
GRADUATE SUMMA.

34:17.229 --> 34:20.101
I'M PROBABLY NOT EVEN
GOING TO GRADUATE AT ALL.

34:21.668 --> 34:25.063

WHAT DO YOU GET
OUT OF THAT?

FOR YOU.

PICKING UP THEIR DEAD
FOR, LIKE, HOURS.

AND MAYBE IT ISN'T,

THAT I DO IT.

LOOK AT ME.

41:07.639 --> 41:09.031
AFTERWARDS, HE WENT
STRAIGHT UP TO BED.

NO TV, NOTHING.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.997

BE FOR YOU,

42:34.769 --> 42:37.293

HURT TO DO SOMETHING

42:39.687 --> 42:43.430

WOULD IT BE TO GO BACK
TO THEM AND SAY,

DO THAT, JULIA.

COME ON, NED.

43:15.505 --> 43:18.421
AND ALL BECAUSE
THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED
OUT THE EXACT RIGHT WAY

43:18.421 --> 43:20.641
TO BALANCE A SITUATION

43:20.641 --> 43:23.949
THAT IS SO INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT AND SAD AND
UNFAIR FOR EVERYBODY.

43:23.949 --> 43:26.081
NOT JUST YOU.

43:30.564 --> 43:32.871
YOU KNOW WHAT, NED?
YOU'RE AN ANGRY GUY.

43:32.871 --> 43:37.049
I'M NOT ANGRY AT YOU.

43:37.049 --> 43:39.704
WELL, THAT'S NOT
MUCH OF A CONSOLATION
IF THE PLAN IS

43:39.704 --> 43:42.184
TO WRECK YOUR LIFE
WHEN I HAPPEN TO BE
A PART OF IT.

43:44.230 --> 43:46.232
OH, GOD.

43:46.232 --> 43:49.801
YOU'RE GOING TO
TRY TO SAVE ME NOW,
AREN'T YOU?

43:49.801 --> 43:54.283
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE WORTH SAVING.

44:04.554 --> 44:06.948
DON'T GIVE UP
ON ME, JULIA...

44:06.948 --> 44:07.819
PLEASE.
