on my favorite equity story?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.178
Uh, I think Goldman
thinks it's unbecoming

12:42.178 --> 12:43.345
that I'm getting pounded

12:43.429 --> 12:45.014
by a group
of involuntary celibates.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.516
- - JESSE: Think I
should, uh, cut my losses,

12:47.600 --> 12:49.977
before I'm too deep in the red
and I end up on the front page

12:49.977 --> 12:52.021
- of the <i>Journal.</i>
- Well, the Reddit squeeze

12:52.021 --> 12:54.815
is a distraction
from the acquisition story.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.151
The Amazon guy joining is just
the first signal.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.612
Amazon buy FastAide, uh,

12:59.612 --> 13:02.531
I reckon they become favorites
to win the hot NHS contracts

13:02.615 --> 13:05.284
and blow competitors like Rican
into irrelevancy.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.121
Harper.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.918
What would you do?
Would you stop out of FastAide

13:13.918 --> 13:15.211
or would you run it?

13:17.796 --> 13:21.217
Obviously, as a member
of the Pierpoint CPS desk,

13:21.217 --> 13:23.344
I would have never
taken you short.

13:25.721 --> 13:26.847
Wouldn't you?

13:28.140 --> 13:31.644
But if I were your coverage
at Goldman, I would say...

13:33.229 --> 13:35.231
"What is your threshold
for pain,

13:35.231 --> 13:37.691
if you believed in the idea
in the first place?"

13:41.111 --> 13:44.615
Danny, final thing.
If your coverage had gotten you

13:44.615 --> 13:47.409
into a structurally
broken company like FastAide,

13:47.493 --> 13:49.662
with a massive short base,
and then hid when it began

13:49.662 --> 13:51.622
to rip the other way,
what would you do?

13:53.040 --> 13:55.376
Call them an amateur
and pull the line.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.586
Oh, yeah, without a doubt,
line out, finished.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.424
Yeah? So what have we done
to deserve your presence?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.677
Oh, well, I just wanted
to make Harper look

14:04.677 --> 14:06.720
like a, uh, rock star
on the desk.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.064
You gonna tell me
what the fuck's going on?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.357
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.109
Spare me.
What was that dance?

14:20.109 --> 14:22.236
- He's eccentric.
- You're his coverage.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.739
Our highest conviction long
this quarter has been FastAide.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.908
Why is he short at the point
of pain? Explain that to me.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.368
Do you really think he listens
to me?

14:29.368 --> 14:31.370
I'm a fucking
third year analyst.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.247
He keeps me around
because I'm young

14:33.247 --> 14:34.665
and a woman and I nod at him.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.333
Do you expect me to buy
that shit?

14:36.417 --> 14:38.460
Whatever happened in Berlin,
whatever is happening

14:38.544 --> 14:40.754
between us personally, we--

14:40.838 --> 14:43.132
we established a very healthy
working relationship.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.883
So if you're in trouble,
just say.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.302
I can't believe I'm talking

14:46.302 --> 14:48.304
about this on the hoot,
but for better or for worse...

14:48.304 --> 14:49.638
- But don't lie to me.
- ...loads of kids...

14:49.722 --> 14:51.140
- on the internet...
- We don't come back from that.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.309
...are making FastAide
the market story of the day.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.312
I have nothing to do with this.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.063
This is why guys like Bloom
are so hard to cover.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.149
You're...
...you're disposable.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.859
He's probably got a Harper
working at every other place

15:01.859 --> 15:03.110
- on the street.
- I doubt it.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.820
(OVER HOOT) It's
about over, plus 30 percent.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.115
So, I'll be fielding questions
on flow color for ten minutes,

15:08.115 --> 15:13.495
and ten minutes only.
This is beneath me. Thank you.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.498
That's your ego speaking.
You might have heard

15:16.582 --> 15:20.252
Adler's coming over for Rif,
but that's just a ruse.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.254
Between us, I'm not supposed
to say this yet,

15:22.338 --> 15:25.382
but colleague to colleague,
I've earmarked you for New York

15:25.466 --> 15:27.134
when we subsume
the London desk.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.386
You can cover Jesse from there.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.013
You can have
whatever glory you need.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.015
But I'm gonna help you call
the plays.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.850
You've made Jesse too important
to us now.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.977
That decision's
already been made?

15:37.061 --> 15:38.187
What about the rest of the desk?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.523
Couple of weeks ago. Firmly.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.901
They're still deciding who
to take to New York, but...

15:45.361 --> 15:46.820
CPS London's cooked.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.948
And you've known
the whole time. Right?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.784
Adler talked to me
a couple days ago and...

15:52.826 --> 15:54.328
he asked me who
was worthy of being

15:54.328 --> 15:56.455
beamed up to the mothership.
I said,

15:57.247 --> 16:00.668
you. And, of course, Bloom.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.212
All we have to do now is sing
from the same hymn sheet

16:03.212 --> 16:04.630
and everything will be golden.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.511
You told me not to give a fuck
about your personal life.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.889
Just don't lie to me in here,
Harper. Okay?

16:19.478 --> 16:21.855
You still up
for Tough Mudder next week then?

16:23.399 --> 16:26.527
Oi, Hanani. Is it possible to be
long vega but short gamma

16:26.527 --> 16:28.445
on an option structure?

16:28.529 --> 16:31.907
- Uh, I don't know.
- Oh, answer the question,

16:31.907 --> 16:33.033
you ditzy cunt.

16:35.536 --> 16:39.957
Yeah, yeah, answer it,
you silly bitch.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.546
Have you ever been horrible
to anyone in your life?

16:45.546 --> 16:46.964
That was fucking pathetic.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.678
Sorry, I have no idea
what's going on.

16:52.678 --> 16:53.971
Whoo!

16:53.971 --> 16:55.764
- Fucking hell.
- Got you a gift.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.768
You shouldn't have.

17:03.814 --> 17:07.067
Wow.  Is it Tiffany's?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.194
- Oh, fuck off, clean-shirt.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.613
In case you get bored on the way
to the meeting.

17:11.697 --> 17:16.243
Well, that's very thoughtful.
Thank you.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.703
Shame Wyndy's not here.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.456
Yeah, thoughts and prayers.
Anyway, uh...

17:22.374 --> 17:23.667
I didn't realize...

17:24.835 --> 17:27.921
how much I enjoyed
having you around.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.466
I appreciate you.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.178
Nice one.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.145
Kenny. Uh, I'm really sorry
about last night.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.398
I'm not exactly sure what
I said, I know it was heinous,

17:46.482 --> 17:49.443
- given that I woke up ashamed.
- Ah...

17:49.443 --> 17:52.613
they asked me to weigh in
with a practical joke as well.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.948
I didn't know if
it was inappropriate or not.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.409
And also, I didn't know how long
it was gonna take,

17:57.493 --> 18:00.078
but once it was started,
I was all in, so...

18:10.088 --> 18:13.467
- I don't really use a stapler.
- Yeah, I had to Amazon it.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.011
Joke still stands though.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.000
Is that like
a sober thing?

18:47.084 --> 18:50.629
- I'm really lost.
- You should, uh...

18:50.629 --> 18:52.548
you should really watch
more telly.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.468
- Good luck.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.681
Thanks, guys.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.695
- Nice one. Fucking LOL.
- Uh-huh.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.364
Pierpoint, Yasmin speaking.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.241
<i>It's your new boss.</i>

19:19.241 --> 19:21.410
<i>Can you take an hour off
for lunch?</i>

19:22.160 --> 19:24.204
Yeah. Sure.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.207
I'm very free.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.626
<i>You're based
in Notting Hill, right?</i>

19:35.716 --> 19:38.844
FastAide opens
up at 45 percent.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.012
That is wild, wild shit.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.430
How'd they
pull themselves away

19:41.430 --> 19:43.432
from their stepsister porn
long enough to buy the stock?

19:43.432 --> 19:45.726
Fuck's sake,
go down you piece of shit.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.355
Uh, you know it's like CVS
or Boots in the UK.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.190
Oh, do you have, uh,
a Robinhood account?

19:52.274 --> 19:54.234
Yeah, they're-- they're not--
actually not allowed here.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.112
I know we haven't really spoken,
um, since Berlin.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.324
I'm here to talk about it
whenever you want.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.910
I mean, obviously,
not right now.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.786
Whenever else.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.998
There's nothing really to say.
Super fun trip though, right?

20:09.833 --> 20:12.127
Yeah. Super fun.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.588
You sure you're okay?

20:17.841 --> 20:19.718
I've drunk myself into infamy.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.470
Can I have one
of your vitamin C tablets?

20:21.470 --> 20:23.597
I have a client lunch, um,

20:23.597 --> 20:25.557
- need to equilibrate the brain.
- You don't have to ask,

20:25.641 --> 20:26.934
you can just come take it.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.104
It's my last day
on the desk today.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.565
Nice. Congratulations.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.776
It means we're not going to be
seeing so much of each other.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.819
I'm not gonna be
in your eyeline.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.238
- It's not a very big building.
- It's quite big--

20:40.322 --> 20:41.949
Sorry, is there something else
that I can help you with?

20:41.949 --> 20:44.451
It's just this morning
has been a bit crazy.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.870
Fuck's sake,
I should have been in long PA.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.622
This thing is moving.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.957
You sure you're not gonna
miss this?

20:49.957 --> 20:52.125
Well, you should come over
for dinner sometime.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.419
I've got a new pizza oven,
in the garden and it's harder

20:54.503 --> 20:56.672
to get going
than a nuclear reactor.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.090
You might be able to work it.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.259
H, have you seen Bloomie?
Gus' boss

21:00.259 --> 21:01.510
just got elevated
to Health Minister.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.011
So that's bearish FastAide,
bullish Rican?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.888
Nah, it's bullish FastAide,
bearish Rican.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.641
- That's right, ain't it, Harper?
- Sounds good. Let's find a time.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.853
- I'll miss you.
- Miss you too.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.856
What, when Bono retires?

21:16.024 --> 21:17.275
What?

21:19.987 --> 21:22.197
Fuck the FCA, mate.
I think I'm gonna have to get

21:22.197 --> 21:25.575
a burner and download Robinhood.
These geeks are making money.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.217
Turin in ‘05,
I bunked onto the plane,

21:42.217 --> 21:45.512
- and bumped into the ground.
- You did?

21:45.512 --> 21:48.348
The first time we played
Juventus since Heysel.

21:48.432 --> 21:53.478
It was fucking heavy, lad.
F... Police escorts,

21:53.562 --> 21:56.857
fucking raining bottles
of piss and coins.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.902
That's when you feel alive.
I went missing for two days

22:00.986 --> 22:03.363
- after, you know?
- You stop going?

22:05.115 --> 22:06.700
Sorta fell away, you know.

22:07.784 --> 22:11.830
Tickets were expensive
and then my mates...

22:13.123 --> 22:15.417
they stopped sorting me
'cause I kept going missing.

22:17.419 --> 22:21.631
Hey, I think I'm too much
for some people, you know, lad.

22:21.715 --> 22:25.343
- Nah, you're all right mate.
- Yeah?

22:25.427 --> 22:28.597
- Hey, listen, look have you, um,

22:28.597 --> 22:30.223
have you managed to find
a counsellor?

22:31.475 --> 22:32.601
No, it's just, look, um...

22:32.601 --> 22:33.977
It's just that
I've been given, a...

22:35.103 --> 22:36.563
A few months wait they said.

22:39.316 --> 22:43.653
- Well, come on, given what?
- Nothing.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.240
But look, it's--
I'm not qualified to talk to you

22:47.324 --> 22:50.202
about that kinda thing.
It's irresponsible.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.412
What about the guy
I connected you with?

22:52.496 --> 22:53.789
Oh, him? Nah...

22:54.915 --> 22:55.957
crap.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.375
There's this service
we're hoping to roll out

22:57.459 --> 22:58.960
to the public eventually.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.295
At the moment,
it's a bit pricey,

23:00.295 --> 23:02.464
but I'll be happy to cover you
for a few sessions.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.965
Nah,
you don't have to do that, lad.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.593
No, no, look, as many as you need.
Just go to the app store

23:06.593 --> 23:07.719
and look for Rican.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.807
- Hey, what's funny?
- Oh,

23:11.807 --> 23:12.974
you got no idea, have ya?

23:13.058 --> 23:16.144
- What?
- A fucking app store on that?

23:16.228 --> 23:17.979
- That's your phone?
- Yeah.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.440
- Looks like Lego.
- Look, it vibrates and everything.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.693
Hey, bum head, have you never
seen one of these?

23:23.777 --> 23:27.030
Look, um, I've-- I've got, uh,
I've got a thing

23:27.114 --> 23:29.116
out of town today, but...

23:29.116 --> 23:31.118
I'll be right here
when you're back this evening.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.371
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.789
- Sound.

23:42.754 --> 23:46.633
My house isn't exactly
a renowned lunch spot.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.052
Although, there is the original
Ottolenghi round the corner,

23:49.136 --> 23:51.012
if you want to order in.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.015
- Would you like a drink?
- Water, if you have it.

23:55.767 --> 23:56.768
Yeah.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.066
- I live in a major conurbation.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.236
London, so, uh...

24:07.279 --> 24:08.321
Yeah.

24:09.739 --> 24:12.033
I have water.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.164
Don't be nervous.

24:19.499 --> 24:20.542
I'm not nervous.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.680
I want to taste you.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.203
I don't really think your
little brother's confirmation

27:02.287 --> 27:04.456
is the most apposite place
for you

27:04.456 --> 27:07.542
to show up with a puckish
little twink.

27:07.542 --> 27:08.710
Within the queer taxonomy,

27:08.710 --> 27:10.211
I wouldn't say you're very twinkish.

27:11.546 --> 27:14.674
- Yeah.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.343
They're not totally backwards,
but there will be

27:16.343 --> 27:20.138
a few pregnant stares for sure.
It's not fair on Isaac.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.848
Have you told them
about your promotion?

27:23.350 --> 27:24.392
I'm not taking it.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.481
Enjoying speaking
to troubled people

27:29.481 --> 27:31.941
on the margins too much?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.943
See, that's exactly the kind
of tone that you pretend to hate

27:34.027 --> 27:35.612
though it comes out your mouth
a lot.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.326
I actually really fucking enjoy
that work.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.036
It's rewarding in a way
that I know my family

27:43.036 --> 27:44.245
just won't understand.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.998
Mum's been in Ghana.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.918
Dad's not been able to get out
of Angola. Until now.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.961
It's weird.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.090
Jesse moved to London

27:55.090 --> 27:59.677
and it feels like we're in
a longer-distance relationship.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.262
He took me
to the British Museum

28:01.346 --> 28:04.099
on the weekend, and was like,
"Look at all this cool

28:04.099 --> 28:07.394
old shit."
And I was like,

28:07.394 --> 28:13.108
"Yeah, it is cool,
all this old shit."

28:13.108 --> 28:17.112
And like, I mean, I didn't say
this obviously, but...

28:18.154 --> 28:19.364
those years are gone.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.492
What about your offer?

28:23.535 --> 28:24.828
Apparently, it's still pending.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.750
Hey, they give them out
in December.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.047
Why didn't you just tell me
you didn't get in?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.677
You worked really hard.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.846
It's okay to admit
you're disappointed.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.439
I wanted to get in.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.943
You made me wanna get in.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.903
And I didn't and that's fine.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.322
Billionaire's son
doesn't get into Oxford.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.284
Cry me a fucking river.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.170
Train's been cancelled.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.922
Frozen track. Fuck.

29:19.215 --> 29:20.383
Fuck it.

29:21.843 --> 29:22.886
I'll play the card.

29:27.056 --> 29:31.936
Jesse, can you, um, send a car
to take us to school?

29:41.404 --> 29:42.614
Harper!

29:45.408 --> 29:46.409
How are you?

29:48.620 --> 29:52.332
I've thrown myself headlong
into my new opportunity

29:52.332 --> 29:55.460
from the spacious confines
of my garret.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.006
- You're fucking miserable?

30:02.383 --> 30:03.426
Are you okay?

30:06.137 --> 30:07.138
Uh...

30:08.681 --> 30:09.682
no.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.143
No, I'm in trouble.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.730
- Past fucked?
- Yeah.

30:17.106 --> 30:20.151
"Past fucked.
Do not collect 200 dollars”?

30:20.235 --> 30:22.153
- No, yeah. I'm fucked.
- Oh, boy.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.448
- Ignorance is bliss.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.370
Thank you.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.081
In all honesty,

30:33.081 --> 30:36.501
I've been thinking
of finally hitting a bid away.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.087
I've started taking calls,

30:39.087 --> 30:42.298
stopped hanging up
on headhunters.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.385
- High time I hitched a lift.
- So, nothing's sticking?

30:45.385 --> 30:48.304
Surely you could just walk
into any other job.

30:48.388 --> 30:52.934
At the same level? Course,
I've got the contacts.

30:54.018 --> 30:57.105
I'm not sure they love me
for me.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.774
I'm pretty sure they
never loved me...

30:59.774 --> 31:00.900
...just for me.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.029
I've started talking
about my feelings

31:05.113 --> 31:06.739
a little more as you can see.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.616
Text when
you're waiting for me, yeah?

31:10.368 --> 31:11.411
When I hired you...

31:12.537 --> 31:13.746
what'd I look like to you?

31:14.831 --> 31:16.416
Mr. Pierpoint, right?

31:18.376 --> 31:22.380
But I could be,
Mr. Morgan Stanley, Mr. Nomura.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.965
I wouldn't want
to be Mr. Nomura,

31:23.965 --> 31:25.425
but that's by the by.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.469
These institutions
are just shells

31:28.553 --> 31:31.306
that shelter you
and your key-client relationship

31:31.306 --> 31:32.432
and if you keep that,

31:32.432 --> 31:34.225
you can manage
someone like Bloom,

31:34.309 --> 31:35.935
you can migrate from place
to place.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.979
They'll fucking house you,
pay you up,

31:37.979 --> 31:39.147
and call you family.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.316
You become bigger
than the institution.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.777
You have Bloom,
you don't need Pierpoint.

31:47.196 --> 31:48.239
What about your skills?

31:51.826 --> 31:54.746
What are my transferable skills,
I mean, really?

31:56.205 --> 31:58.791
And my current client list
isn't exactly something

31:58.875 --> 32:00.918
you'd pay up for.

32:01.002 --> 32:03.254
Don't sound so defeated,
it doesn't suit you.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.508
Well, who was responsible
for my defeat?

32:11.763 --> 32:12.764
You were.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.808
The moment you'd accepted
you lost.

32:16.934 --> 32:19.187
And Daniel, of course.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.148
It's the quietly motivated ones
you gotta watch out for.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.069
What are you talking about?

32:27.528 --> 32:29.197
You don't feel the knife

32:29.197 --> 32:31.366
when it goes in right
between your ribs.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.794
FastAide coming off
its high here.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.552
Rish-Rish, what's behind
this reversal in FastAide?

32:51.636 --> 32:53.221
- Any ideas?

32:53.221 --> 32:57.392
Sec. Sec. It does look that way.
I'm just digging on IB. Sec.

33:06.401 --> 33:09.987
So, This is where it happens,
huh? All that learning.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.532
Um, Leo
said you needed transport,

33:12.532 --> 33:14.951
is he here? Hmm?

33:14.951 --> 33:19.038
Ah, hey. I didn't see,
uh, taxicab driver

33:19.122 --> 33:21.916
in my future but, uh,
we are where we are.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.002
Why are you here?

33:25.086 --> 33:26.838
You know, I ask myself
the same thing

33:26.838 --> 33:28.381
every time I'm away from my rig.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.135
You know I can
do whatever I want right?

33:36.723 --> 33:39.851
So I have two very conspicuous
looking escalades

33:39.851 --> 33:42.353
waiting outside.
It's like I'm moving weight.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.105
One is going to take you

33:44.105 --> 33:46.107
to the chief nursery
of England's statesmen,

33:46.107 --> 33:48.401
and the other one is gonna take
you and I

33:48.401 --> 33:50.570
wherever you wanna go, Leo.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.238
Can you just give me
a lift into town?

33:55.825 --> 33:59.495
Gus. When am I gonna see
some ROI on all that cash

33:59.579 --> 34:02.206
I dropped on Leo's tutelage?
I mean, you're fucking my son,

34:02.290 --> 34:04.000
the least you could do
is get him into college, right?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.418
- What the fuck?
- Don't worry,

34:05.418 --> 34:06.627
you know I'm an ally.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.629
It's not financially viable
not to be

34:08.713 --> 34:09.797
in the current culture.

34:12.508 --> 34:15.303
He's, um, he's still waiting
to hear back.

34:16.512 --> 34:19.974
All right. I cleared my entire
schedule for today...

34:20.975 --> 34:23.227
and you are gonna have lunch
with me.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.354
Why are you dressed like
pound shop GQ?

34:25.438 --> 34:26.939
I don't know what that is.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.900
I have an evening engagement.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.779
I am a public figure, Leopold.
Your father's a public figure.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.656
All right? Are you not
in any way proud of that?

34:35.740 --> 34:36.908
Not particularly, Dad, no.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.493
Well, you know what?
Neither am I.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.286
Apple does not fall far
from the tree.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.663
Sorry, sorry, Jesse,
I really do need to go.

34:42.747 --> 34:43.915
Are you okay
to let yourself out?

34:43.915 --> 34:45.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the car is waiting for you.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.210
We can continue this
on the way home?

34:47.210 --> 34:48.836
- Just drop me off in town.
- Hey, dude.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.171
Uh, hey. I'm--
I'm really trying now.

34:50.171 --> 34:51.589
Can you-- can you give me
a break?

34:51.589 --> 34:53.758
Can you not do this
in front of Gus?

34:53.758 --> 34:55.802
It's not what he expects
from a public figure.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.020
I really do appreciate the lift.

35:06.020 --> 35:09.482
- I bet your parents are proud.

35:12.109 --> 35:14.654
All we have
is work, huh?

35:17.198 --> 35:18.616
Listen Jesse, I think this thing
is about to move

35:18.616 --> 35:20.827
- our fucking way.
- I'm done with you.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.829
- Why did I pick up?
- <i>Why did you pick up?</i>

35:22.829 --> 35:24.789
I'm fucked if I know,
but we can psychoanalyze

35:24.789 --> 35:27.166
the whys of you and me
when I'm old and you're older.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.377
But, right now,
you just need to listen.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.420
FastAide very fucking fragile

35:31.504 --> 35:32.839
up here now.
Most of the key shorts

35:32.839 --> 35:36.425
have been cleared out
and positioning is much cleaner.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.886
I assume there's a couple
of big institutional guys

35:38.970 --> 35:40.221
still to go.
Those Reddit virgins

35:40.221 --> 35:42.181
don't ever really stand
a chance against fundamentals

35:42.265 --> 35:43.266
and gravity.

35:44.892 --> 35:46.727
So the party's over?

35:46.811 --> 35:48.354
Our short's moving
in our direction.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.523
Prudent to stop out
at a more favorable level.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.195
No, our party's just starting.

35:57.780 --> 35:58.781
Do you trust me?

35:58.865 --> 36:01.367
I don't know where you're going
with this.

36:01.367 --> 36:05.830
That whatever, ineffable,
subconscious thing,

36:05.830 --> 36:09.375
do you have that with me?
Do you trust me?

36:09.375 --> 36:12.253
<i>Look your trader says
it's held up by air.</i>

36:12.253 --> 36:14.839
<i>After the last guy stops out,
it's cratering.</i>

36:14.839 --> 36:16.424
And that last guy is me.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.385
That's not the trade.
That's not our trade.

36:19.385 --> 36:21.470
I'm not stopping out.
I am not letting you walk away

36:21.554 --> 36:24.724
from this with a loss.
We sell more into the reversal.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.435
<i>And we pummel this bitch
until she yelps.</i>

36:27.435 --> 36:29.979
That's all very cute,
but you heard your trader.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.357
He thinks it's going down now,
from his lips to God's ears.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.026
He's not going to put
in a strong bid.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.403
<i>- I mean, w-- what's the
catalyst?</i> - Yes, it's going down.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.697
But that is the trade
after the trade.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.241
First, he needs to think
it's going up...

36:42.325 --> 36:45.494
<i>because a big investor
still needs to buy to cover</i>

36:45.578 --> 36:47.246
<i>in order to stop out.</i>

36:47.330 --> 36:50.416
<i>You are gonna be
that big investor.</i>

36:50.416 --> 36:52.376
<i>I'll make sure he reads you
the wrong way.</i>

36:53.669 --> 36:55.755
We are going to cheat him.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.965
We're gonna tell him
that you're stopping out,

36:58.049 --> 37:00.760
<i>he'll think you're buying
to cover the short,</i>

37:00.760 --> 37:02.929
<i>so he'll set his price high.</i>

37:02.929 --> 37:05.556
We'll get his price,
and then we'll sell through him

37:05.640 --> 37:07.308
and move this thing
our direction.

37:07.308 --> 37:10.102
- You pull this off...
- Then you are my client.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.813
And you will tell everyone.

37:12.897 --> 37:19.403
And if I wanna go to MS, GS,
CS, Citi, fucking Mars,

37:19.487 --> 37:21.614
you will tell them
that I am the guarantor

37:21.614 --> 37:22.740
of your business.

37:23.866 --> 37:26.953
You make this happen,
maybe we are talking again.

37:29.205 --> 37:32.375
- Sec.

37:32.375 --> 37:37.004
Rish, Bloom's in max pain.
He shorted a ton of FastAide

37:37.088 --> 37:39.590
through Goldman and he wants
to stop out through us,

37:39.674 --> 37:41.634
cut his short. Can we help?

37:43.594 --> 37:46.472
If he can hear me,
if the prick can hear me...

37:47.390 --> 37:48.557
He get that?

37:49.934 --> 37:51.686
Tell him I, uh, I love the name.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.855
No, no. I-- I adore the name.
I introduced the name

37:54.939 --> 37:57.191
to my parents after I rattled
her seven ways to Sunday.

37:57.191 --> 37:59.318
<i>That's how much
I love FastAide.</i>

37:59.402 --> 38:00.653
Getting out is gonna cost him.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.822
Okay, he gets it.
You have a big dick.

38:02.822 --> 38:03.906
You know his direction?

38:03.990 --> 38:05.491
He has to buy to cover
to stop out.

38:05.491 --> 38:06.909
He wants to know
how wide you'll be

38:06.993 --> 38:09.203
- in 19 million shares.
- Actually, tell him,

38:09.203 --> 38:11.872
the exact amount
is 18.952 million,

38:11.956 --> 38:13.666
<i>then he'll definitely think
it's an unwind</i>

38:13.666 --> 38:14.917
<i>and I'm getting out.</i>

38:15.001 --> 38:18.713
Sorry the exact amount is, um,
18.952 million shares.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.007
- Full size, only you.

38:22.258 --> 38:25.469
Okay, last trade
was 92, trading up.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.556
I can make him
60 points wide around my mid

38:28.556 --> 38:32.893
on 18.952 million,
if he guarantees to trade now.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.520
Fuck Dodd Frank.
How're you left?

38:34.520 --> 38:35.730
<i>Tell him to wait.</i>

38:38.024 --> 38:40.276
85/45 around 3.
He like it?

38:40.276 --> 38:42.028
Make him wait.
We'll get a better price.

38:42.028 --> 38:45.865
Off. Higher now, make him 95/55.
I'm taking him to the cleaners.

38:45.865 --> 38:46.949
Do the man there.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.659
- Yours. Sell, sell, sell.
- Yours.

38:48.743 --> 38:52.371
Bloom sells 18.952 million
at 295.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.914
<i>I'm quietly impressed.</i>

38:54.623 --> 38:55.583
Um...

38:55.583 --> 38:57.418
..."yours"? What do you mean
fucking yours?

38:57.418 --> 38:59.628
-♪ (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) ♪
- I mean, he sells.

39:00.796 --> 39:01.797
Are you mentally challenged?

39:01.881 --> 39:03.174
Are you out
of your fucking tree?

39:03.174 --> 39:05.760
He guaranteed you a trade.
On your spread. On your price.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.011
Not a direction.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.766
You read him too far,
took the piss, he called you out

39:11.766 --> 39:12.892
and that's that.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.229
Do you think I'm soft?

39:19.732 --> 39:22.610
You put your hand up to signal
we were done and he was a buyer.

39:22.610 --> 39:23.903
You misread my signal.

39:23.903 --> 39:27.490
I told you to wait,
and then I signaled to sell.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.992
Rish, we have a verbal contract.
You know that.

39:30.076 --> 39:34.080
Shit happens. Let's just eat it.
It's Bloom. He's satisfied--

39:34.080 --> 39:37.291
Harper, I'm the fucking spiv.
You don't spiv the spiv.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.835
You knowingly helped Rishi
read him the wrong way.

39:39.919 --> 39:42.379
So Rishi laid three points
above the fair price,

39:42.463 --> 39:43.923
expecting Jesse to buy it
off him.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.050
Right! And now I'm long
a load more of this shit

39:46.050 --> 39:49.386
at a shit price.
I'm in a 75-million-dollar hole.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.806
I heard the whole
sorry fucking thing.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.183
I was patched
into your line, Harper.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.810
Well, then,
why didn't you fucking step in?

39:55.810 --> 39:58.145
I wanted proof of who she was.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.606
She's blown up
my entire year.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.483
- - RISHI:
You're gonna be losing friends

40:02.483 --> 40:04.777
- with this kind of behavior.
- And who are you then?

40:06.320 --> 40:09.573
Face value?
I knew you were full of shit.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.284
Go fuck yourself.

40:14.411 --> 40:16.413
I have to take this upstairs immediately.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.333
Immediately.
Log out of your Bloomie.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.418
Fucking now!
I'm not fucking around!

40:43.983 --> 40:46.318
Well, would you look at that,
it's starting to tick up.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.783
Turns out your man's no match
for the internet, love.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.456
Get off my fucking floor.

41:23.105 --> 41:27.151
“The room was in that disorder,
produced only by those

41:27.151 --> 41:29.612
- who have always had servants.”

41:31.405 --> 41:32.698
Hemingway.

41:32.698 --> 41:35.117
About a very rich girl
who doesn't know

41:35.201 --> 41:37.244
what she's doing with her life.

41:38.579 --> 41:42.416
- Was she hot at least?

41:47.004 --> 41:49.506
I've never come that many times.

41:52.009 --> 41:56.388
- So many... stages.

41:56.472 --> 41:59.433
And I've never been
with a married person before.

41:59.433 --> 42:03.020


42:03.020 --> 42:04.688
(IN ENGLISH) I've never
thought of myself as

42:04.772 --> 42:07.441
<i>- l'autre femme.</i>
<i>- La maîtresse.</i>

42:08.776 --> 42:10.236
I wouldn't worry.

42:12.154 --> 42:15.032
Elsa and I have our rules.

42:15.032 --> 42:18.535
When it developed to the stage
it got to last night,

42:18.619 --> 42:19.787
I had to tell her.

42:21.997 --> 42:25.000
It's just how we operate.
It works for us.

42:28.921 --> 42:30.881
What did you say?

42:30.965 --> 42:36.387
I told her I was in danger
of breaking one of our rules.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.098
Surely people don't actually
have rules

42:39.098 --> 42:42.476
- around these things.
- Uh, yes.

42:42.476 --> 42:43.644
We established them

42:43.644 --> 42:47.856
when we established
that she was the more

42:47.940 --> 42:50.901
open partner
in our open arrangement.

42:53.696 --> 42:57.616
Sorry, I didn't mean
to freak you out.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.452
I don't mean
to use such practical language.

43:00.536 --> 43:04.456
Elsa is very exacting.
She's a QC, you see.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.002
How long have you been open?

43:08.002 --> 43:09.420
That's Elsa's phrasing.

43:10.337 --> 43:12.840
I prefer polyamorous.

43:14.383 --> 43:16.093
She's not one for monogamy.

43:17.261 --> 43:21.557
She was very promiscuous, and,
I guess it was the '70s.

43:22.725 --> 43:27.271
Then she had a cancer scare
in her 50s,

43:28.063 --> 43:30.024
but I needed some parameters.

43:34.486 --> 43:37.865
She's seeing someone,
so why can't I?

43:42.703 --> 43:45.539
It's nice to be
in an institution as comforting

43:45.539 --> 43:47.666
as marriage
and not feel trapped.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.337
I know you're younger
than me, but surely

43:51.337 --> 43:53.922
you're not naïve enough
to think...

43:54.006 --> 43:56.383
I'm not just a little... messy, huh?

44:20.491 --> 44:21.742
Good lunch?

44:24.286 --> 44:25.371
Have you seen
what that analyst

44:25.371 --> 44:27.456
at Alliance Bernstein's saying
about FastAide?

44:27.456 --> 44:28.874
The Gerry Adams looking one.

44:28.874 --> 44:30.834
Nah, I'd say he's more
Harold Shipman.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.336
Similar vibe, though.

44:32.336 --> 44:34.463
Is this-- is this Robert?

44:34.463 --> 44:35.672
Oh, yeah,
the old glasses...

44:35.756 --> 44:36.965
- Um.
- ...beard aesthetic.

44:37.049 --> 44:39.134
Big criminal energy that combo.
You rock that combo...

44:39.218 --> 44:40.511
- In joke.
- Hmm.

44:40.511 --> 44:41.762
...what is he saying?

44:41.762 --> 44:43.180
Nothing interesting
actually, the more I listen.

44:43.180 --> 44:45.182
Our sense of humor
has matured since then.

44:47.434 --> 44:48.435
Do you know him?

44:48.519 --> 44:52.773
He's kind of mentoring me.
I think.

44:52.773 --> 44:55.109
Interesting path to follow.

44:55.109 --> 44:56.527
Gerry Adams
and Harold Shipman

44:56.527 --> 44:58.320
would make a better equity
analyst than this fella...

44:58.404 --> 44:59.571
Actually,

44:59.655 --> 45:02.074
I'm more and more certain
he is one of the good ones.

45:02.074 --> 45:04.743
Uh, don't worry,

45:04.827 --> 45:08.080
I'd never let myself get used
and abused.

45:10.999 --> 45:14.586
Good.  So,
you shouldn't, me neither.

45:26.056 --> 45:29.059
I know I've not been
much of a mentor.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.186
At all.

45:31.270 --> 45:33.981
But if you ever need anything,
I'm just upstairs.

45:39.153 --> 45:40.612
- Thank you.

45:41.530 --> 45:42.698
Okay.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.509
- Somewhere to be?

46:02.593 --> 46:04.803
Oh, just a work thing later.

46:05.846 --> 46:08.015
We're staying in London
for a week.

46:08.015 --> 46:11.685
Come round for dinner.
You and Leo.

46:11.685 --> 46:15.230
You can see your nephews.
You know, in person.

46:15.314 --> 46:16.982
I'm sorry
I've been a bit absent.

46:19.318 --> 46:20.486
How are they?

46:20.486 --> 46:22.988
Walking reminders
that we're all going to die.

46:22.988 --> 46:25.282
They're walking, already?

46:26.074 --> 46:27.826
I look at them and think "Fuck,

46:27.910 --> 46:31.330
we haven't got much left,
have we?"

46:31.330 --> 46:35.375
- That sounds morbid.
- It's fantastic!

46:35.459 --> 46:38.086
- Reminds me I'm alive.

46:39.713 --> 46:43.050
You know, we'll blink and be
back here with both of them.

46:43.050 --> 46:45.135
Kwaku tried to sign them up
from the hospital

46:45.219 --> 46:46.303
the moment they were born.

46:46.303 --> 46:48.055
Apparently, they don't do
that anymore.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.973
Well, seems
more meritocratic.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.685
It's a miracle we got him here.

46:53.769 --> 46:56.939
He's having
some behavioral issues.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.107
I think they'd appreciate it
if you visited him

46:59.191 --> 47:02.611
once in a while. Talk to him.
Get him back on the right track.

47:07.449 --> 47:10.369
You know you have
to take that promotion, right?

47:12.454 --> 47:14.039
It's admirable,
what you've been doing,

47:14.039 --> 47:16.208
it really is.
And we're all proud of you...

47:17.125 --> 47:18.752
but you need to get going again.

47:18.752 --> 47:20.921
We're not going to just let you
throw your life away.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.130
That seems a bit melodramatic.

47:22.214 --> 47:25.008
Well, we're all prone
to melodrama in this family.

47:26.843 --> 47:29.555
You told them you'd do
three years at Pierpoint.

47:30.347 --> 47:32.307
You did less than a year.

47:32.391 --> 47:35.394
You spend a year
treading water.

47:35.394 --> 47:38.522
Frankly, wasting time,
not contributing.

47:38.522 --> 47:42.734
Static yet unstable.
You've barely seen any of us.

47:42.818 --> 47:45.070
They give you latitude
in other parts of your life.

47:45.070 --> 47:46.905
- What does that mean?
- You know what it means.

47:48.198 --> 47:50.659
And they don't really care anymore.

47:50.659 --> 47:54.413
I mean, they care as little now
as they're ever going to care,

47:54.413 --> 47:57.082
but this instability,

47:57.082 --> 47:59.126
they won't tell you this,
but it kills them.

47:59.126 --> 48:01.628
- I'm working now.
- And it's tantamount to social work.

48:01.712 --> 48:04.506
It has no visible trajectory.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.633
You're bailing out the boat
but the water's just rushing

48:06.717 --> 48:08.135
back in through the holes.

48:09.094 --> 48:10.512
One man can't make
a difference there.

48:10.596 --> 48:12.514
Oh, that's a virtuoso piece
of rhetoric, well done.

48:12.598 --> 48:14.224
- She'd be proud.
- She'd be a lot less subtle

48:14.308 --> 48:15.392
if she got going.

48:17.894 --> 48:21.148
They just want us to live up
to their expectations.

48:21.148 --> 48:24.359
Otherwise, what else
was all this for?

48:29.114 --> 48:32.534
I'm not sure that's physically
or spiritually possible.

48:32.618 --> 48:34.828
Well, then just live up
to your own.

48:35.871 --> 48:37.623
Don't you think
you have a responsibility

48:37.623 --> 48:39.166
to give your kids what you got?

48:42.252 --> 48:44.630
You going to do that
on seventeen grand a year?

48:50.135 --> 48:51.803
It's time to stop dancing.

48:55.599 --> 48:58.018
In the name
of the Father and of the Son,

48:58.018 --> 48:59.227
and of the Holy Spirit.

48:59.978 --> 49:01.313
Amen.

49:01.313 --> 49:02.939
- - JACKIE: Oh, thank
fuck I don't work in equities.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.816
Yas,
who's Mark Michaelides'

49:04.900 --> 49:06.109
number two at Millennium?

49:06.193 --> 49:08.362
Sorry, it was a Wyndy contact.
He's about to jump on.

49:08.820 --> 49:09.905
Samuel Shinner.

49:11.031 --> 49:15.035
Sam! Uh, S-- Samuel.
Are you going now?

49:15.035 --> 49:17.079
Samuel, can I call you
back in five?

49:18.205 --> 49:19.331
Cheers, buddy, thank you.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.918
I'm gonna concede
I have too active of a sex life

49:22.918 --> 49:24.169
- to be a Redditor.
- Hey!

49:24.169 --> 49:25.545
But I respect them.

49:25.629 --> 49:26.713
Thanks.

49:27.964 --> 49:29.174
So,

49:29.174 --> 49:31.843
how many times a week do you
expect to be entertaining then?

49:31.927 --> 49:34.680
Five. Couple of lunches,

49:34.680 --> 49:37.391
the odd weekend here and there,
my entire life.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.351
Silverstone, Ascot,
Henley that sort of thing?

49:39.351 --> 49:41.978
- - KENNY: Stamps
on a drunken asshole's passport.

49:43.230 --> 49:44.523
You know, you spend
that much time with your boss

49:44.523 --> 49:46.233
and they're effectively
your spouse.

49:47.776 --> 49:49.903
Well, that's why you don't cross
a line, do you?

49:52.280 --> 49:56.201
Uh, fuck, Kenny that really
was not a dig at you, um...

49:57.828 --> 50:01.164
Uh, honestly, it was a promise
to my future self.

50:01.248 --> 50:05.085
Future selves, eh? They are pesky fuckers to please.

50:05.085 --> 50:06.169
Mm-hmm.

50:07.170 --> 50:09.172
Look, I don't know
if it's having

50:09.256 --> 50:10.424
to pick up Wyndy's slack

50:10.424 --> 50:12.592
or the prospect of actually
having to manage people

50:12.676 --> 50:14.594
with some degree of competency,
but I feel like I need to--

50:14.678 --> 50:19.057
Oh, no, no, please. It's, um,
it's entirely unnecessary.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.934
- Honestly you don't need to--
- You give someone like me

50:20.934 --> 50:24.271
- a little bit of power and-- I dunno...
- It's a hierarchy.

50:24.271 --> 50:27.065
- I-- I get it, I get it.
- No.

50:27.149 --> 50:29.860
Nah, that's shit.
It's scapegoating.

50:31.153 --> 50:32.237
I sat under Wyndham

50:32.237 --> 50:35.031
and he was never anything
but fair to me,

50:35.115 --> 50:38.702
and sometimes I wonder
what my career would look like

50:38.702 --> 50:42.330
if I had to work under someone
like me. Y'know, like I was.

50:43.540 --> 50:45.834
Well, it's a lottery
who you get to sit next to.

50:45.834 --> 50:50.338
Um... I've won plenty of those
in my life, so it's fine.

50:50.422 --> 50:52.215
- Honestly, it's fine.
- I'm, uh...

50:54.384 --> 50:55.469
I'm glad you're ending up somewhere

50:55.469 --> 50:56.636
you're gonna flourish.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.139
Because I-- I actually do,
I want that for you.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.475
And, um...

51:01.475 --> 51:03.643
I'm sure you don't want to hear
anything about me

51:03.727 --> 51:04.936
for the millionth time.

51:05.020 --> 51:08.523
Um, and you're probably worried
that this is just, uh,

51:08.607 --> 51:10.817
some more bullshit about my own
bullshit, but...

51:12.986 --> 51:14.237
from a place of empathy...

51:15.697 --> 51:18.533
or like, as close as anyone
can physically hope

51:18.617 --> 51:21.244
to understand how somebody else
must have felt.

51:21.328 --> 51:23.371
And I need to say this
to you, um...

51:27.083 --> 51:29.920
I am so sorry, Yasmin.

51:37.052 --> 51:39.429
Hey, Leo. I think
you should give your dad a call.

51:41.473 --> 51:43.600
No, I just don't think
you should lie to your family.

51:45.268 --> 51:46.728
Yeah, call him.

51:51.066 --> 51:53.151
You telling him
will be way more meaningful

51:53.235 --> 51:55.070
than the content
of what you actually say.

51:57.239 --> 51:59.449
Okay. Okay, gotta go, good luck.

52:18.677 --> 52:22.055
Martingale always loses,
eventually.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.435
I'm gonna eat the loss.
Stop out through Goldman.

52:32.232 --> 52:33.400
Jesse, who are we kidding?

52:34.693 --> 52:37.195
This is you.
This is not about the money.

52:38.655 --> 52:41.449
What is it about then?
You tell me.

52:45.287 --> 52:47.038
I look like I'm about to go
on Leno.

52:48.456 --> 52:49.666
Like a fucking clown.

52:50.625 --> 52:52.627
What is this about?

52:54.296 --> 52:56.256
You can't buy the first flush
of a career.

52:57.924 --> 53:03.763
That white heat of a career
trajectory just starting out.

53:05.181 --> 53:08.226
You gave that to me
so you could feel it again.

53:10.228 --> 53:12.063
You really gonna let
the fucking mob win?

53:13.231 --> 53:18.737
- Over you? Jesse fucking Bloom?

53:18.737 --> 53:21.656
You're-- you're appealing
to the worst part of me.

53:22.949 --> 53:26.161
- It's the part that thrills you.

53:27.662 --> 53:30.874
I don't have to tell you,
life is gamified.

53:30.874 --> 53:34.210
You strip away the jargon,
the expertise,

53:34.294 --> 53:36.171
the fucking ceremony.

53:36.171 --> 53:38.715
You chose a career
in the ultimate game.

53:40.091 --> 53:41.134
And you chose me...

53:42.802 --> 53:44.554
because I remind you

53:44.638 --> 53:48.141
that it can still have meaning
if we win.

53:48.141 --> 53:51.186
Go out there,
talk your fucking book,

53:51.186 --> 53:52.646
just like you did
with the pandemic.

53:57.943 --> 53:59.152
You are gonna go out there.

It belongs in the dirt.

54:06.534 --> 54:08.578
You have the power
to obliterate it

54:09.371 --> 54:11.206
just by dint of who you are.

54:14.501 --> 54:15.835
Welcome to the feeling.

54:15.919 --> 54:17.462
...healthcare and telemedicine,

54:17.462 --> 54:20.840
and who is better qualified
to talk about these things

54:20.924 --> 54:22.258
- than Jesse Bloom?

Harper, it's my son.

Hey. Yeah.

54:30.767 --> 54:34.104
It's fine. It's-- it's fine.

54:35.438 --> 54:37.565
No, now's good.

This is our last chance.
I'm already done at Pierpoint.

55:43.339 --> 55:47.093
Apologies,
but due to unforeseen

55:47.177 --> 55:50.013
circumstances, Jesse Bloom
will not be gracing us

55:50.013 --> 55:51.181
with his presence.

55:51.181 --> 55:54.059
We'll be moving straight on
to Diana Amoa

55:54.059 --> 55:57.020
on telemedicine
from an ESG perspective.

56:29.594 --> 56:30.804
Why are you here then?

56:32.222 --> 56:33.431
Are we worth a bid away?

56:38.019 --> 56:41.064
Shut the door, take a seat.
