00:03.571 --> 00:04.772
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

00:06.674 --> 00:08.276
Is that Danny Willis?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.910
Yeah,
we're studying together.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.216
Hey.
Hey, Danny.
Dad, this is...

00:15.283 --> 00:17.951
Danny Willis,
basketball phenom,

00:18.018 --> 00:20.421
the Steph Curry
of Hidden Oaks High School,

00:20.488 --> 00:22.256
in my house!
(LAUGHS)

00:23.757 --> 00:25.493
Oh, I remember
in 5th grade,

00:25.559 --> 00:26.860
you could hit
from anywhere on the court.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.296
How do you know?

00:28.362 --> 00:29.463
I used to watch his games

00:29.530 --> 00:30.798
when I dropped Dave off
at oboe practice.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.166
Clarinet.

00:32.233 --> 00:35.369
Shh! You're embarrassing me
in front of Danny Willis!

00:35.436 --> 00:37.004
It's nice to meet you,
Dr. Park.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.772
Oh, it's nice
to meet you.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.508
So, um...

00:40.574 --> 00:41.775
So, yeah,
so, you know,

00:41.842 --> 00:44.145
what are you guys
studying, man?

00:44.212 --> 00:45.546
Oh, uh, AP Bio.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.315
AP Bio?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.382
A baller with brains?

00:48.449 --> 00:50.351
The Steph Curry
of science, too!

00:50.418 --> 00:52.086
(LAUGHS)

00:52.153 --> 00:54.222
What can't this guy do?

00:54.288 --> 00:56.023
Well,
he can't start studying

00:56.090 --> 00:58.192
until you get yourself
under control!

00:58.259 --> 00:59.627
Am I in his lap?

00:59.693 --> 01:00.694
Not yet.

01:00.761 --> 01:01.829
Then I'm under control!

01:03.331 --> 01:04.432
Anyway, bro,

01:04.498 --> 01:06.100
good luck at the
championship game Friday.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.368
Wolfpack rules!

01:07.435 --> 01:09.237
Westbrook sucks!

01:13.674 --> 01:15.409
*

01:16.577 --> 01:17.978
Well, it's official.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.880
Connor and I
are living together.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.615
Oh, that's right!
He moved in today.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.916
Congrats!
Thanks.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.485
Yeah, I can finally use
that welcome mat that says

01:24.552 --> 01:28.021
"Home is where the heart is"
without it being super-sad.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.524
I remember when Ken and I
moved in together.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.393
He used to leave
little love notes for me.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.894
I still leave you notes.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.296
Oh, right.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.565
This was on my pillow
last night.

01:37.631 --> 01:41.302
"Don't use
the downstairs toilet."

01:41.369 --> 01:42.736
Turn it over.
There's more.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.839
"Seriously, don't."

01:47.741 --> 01:49.443
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

01:50.811 --> 01:52.146
Hmm.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.882
Molly said Danny Willis hurt
his ankle at practice today

01:54.948 --> 01:57.151
and is wondering
if I could take a look at him.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.686
"Uh, chyah!"

02:00.154 --> 02:01.655
You're pretty booked
this afternoon.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.725
Damona,
I said "Chyah!"

02:04.792 --> 02:06.059
It's Danny Willis!

02:06.126 --> 02:08.696
Does Wolfpack pride
mean nothing to you?

02:08.762 --> 02:10.764
It literally means
nothing to me.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.634
*

02:13.701 --> 02:15.068
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hey, Pat...

02:15.135 --> 02:17.605
Aah! Allison!

02:17.671 --> 02:20.241
What smells so good?
Are you making coffee?

02:20.308 --> 02:22.610
(LAUGHING) Oh, no.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.378
All right, you caught me.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.247
Don't tell anyone.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.015
I brought my baby
to work.

02:28.081 --> 02:31.352
Wow, that is, like,
professional-grade.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.086
I saw one of those
in Italy.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.323
So you enjoy cappuccino?

02:35.389 --> 02:37.057
I used to drink them
all the time.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.826
But then
I married Ken and...

02:38.892 --> 02:41.529
I don't know, sometimes
it's better to be asleep.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.435
Here.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.641
Oh, my God.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.843
This is literally
the best coffee
I've ever had.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.378
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.847
Why?

02:59.913 --> 03:03.251
People might start hanging out
with me just because of this.

03:03.317 --> 03:06.220
See, my coffee
is robust and flavorful,

03:06.287 --> 03:09.457
but not a lot of people feel
the same about my personality.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.225
That's ridiculous.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.227
You're robust
and fla...

03:13.294 --> 03:14.362
You're delightful.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.596
Really?

03:15.663 --> 03:17.365
Absolutely.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.633
Thank you.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.869
Hey, why don't you
have a seat?

03:21.935 --> 03:22.970
Let's chat.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.739
Oh, um...

03:30.978 --> 03:32.413
(LAUGHING)
No, I swear to God.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.782
Ken and I searched all over
the house for Dave's pajamas

03:34.848 --> 03:36.484
until I looked at Ken
and realized

03:36.550 --> 03:38.085
he was wearing them.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.853
(BOTH LAUGH)

03:39.920 --> 03:42.556
He is
a tiny, childlike man.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.594
Oh, gosh! I got to
get back to work!

03:46.660 --> 03:48.228
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

03:48.296 --> 03:51.332
Why don't you
take your 'cino to go?

03:51.399 --> 03:52.433
Thank you.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.368
All right.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.936
All right.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.638
Same time tomorrow?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.973
Oh, I can't. I got to
take Dave to school.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.111
Oh, screw it.
He can Uber.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.014
*

04:08.716 --> 04:09.783
Does this hurt?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.252
A little.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.921
Okay, can you push back
on my hand?

04:13.987 --> 04:15.389
Push, push.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.658
So, about
the championship
game Friday?

04:17.725 --> 04:20.361
Yeah, I have
some bad news...

04:20.428 --> 04:23.230
for Westbrook High,
because you gonna play
in that game, son.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.632
(LAUGHS)

04:24.698 --> 04:26.400
It's just a contusion,
not a sprain.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.535
Oh, thank God.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.169
Oh, please,
call me Dr. Park.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.273
Thank you so much.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.142
Hey, thank me
when you're in the NBA,

04:35.208 --> 04:37.077
with a signed jersey,
huh?

04:37.144 --> 04:38.579
Or tickets
or, I don't know,

04:38.646 --> 04:39.680
make me part
of your entourage.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.382
I can be Asian Turtle.
(CHUCKLES)

04:47.421 --> 04:48.589
Hey.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.758
Danny, can you reach
your fingers

04:50.824 --> 04:52.626
all the way around
your other wrist?

04:52.693 --> 04:55.128
Um...yeah.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.932
(SIGHS)

05:01.369 --> 05:02.570
Is something wrong?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.407
Hey, buddy, do you mind
hanging around a little
while longer?

05:06.474 --> 05:07.708
(PATS TABLE)

05:07.775 --> 05:09.109
*

05:12.446 --> 05:13.481
*

05:15.048 --> 05:18.051
Oh, damn!
What smells so good?

05:19.387 --> 05:20.554
Where'd you get
that coffee?

05:20.621 --> 05:22.322
Oh, from the...
downstairs cafeteria.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.924
No! No!

05:23.991 --> 05:25.526
That's Pat's coffee.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.195
What? No.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.598
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
I know that coffee
anywhere.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.899
When we were together,

05:31.965 --> 05:34.201
Pat used to
make that for me
every morning.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.103
I stayed with him
for an extra month

05:36.169 --> 05:38.071
just for those cappuccinos.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.442
Fine. You got me.
(CHUCKLES)

05:42.476 --> 05:44.445
Are you hooking up
with Pat?

05:45.278 --> 05:46.547
No!

05:46.614 --> 05:48.549
He just brought
his espresso machine
to work.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.418
(GASPS)
No, no, no! But you
can't say anything!

05:50.484 --> 05:52.285
I told him
I wouldn't tell
anyone.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.487
Can you get me a cup?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.723
No.
Oh!

05:55.789 --> 05:56.990
Okay, y... you can
have a sip of mine.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.125
Really?

05:59.793 --> 06:00.928
Oh, damn!

06:02.329 --> 06:03.597
Wow!
I'm so sorry!

06:03.664 --> 06:05.433
That's messed up,
Allison!

06:05.499 --> 06:07.200
You can't... Please.
Eh, deh, deh, deh, deh!

06:07.267 --> 06:10.771
I don't even need you.
I don't even need you.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.506
Pat's out of the office
all afternoon,

06:12.573 --> 06:15.008
and I've got the keys
to everybody's office.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.309
(GASPS)
No! No, no, no, no!

06:16.376 --> 06:18.311
You can't.
I gave Pat my word.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.379
You want a refill?

06:19.447 --> 06:21.081
Let's do this.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.153
So, based on my exam,

06:26.219 --> 06:27.788
I heard a loud
heart murmur,

06:27.855 --> 06:29.790
and I noticed
the length of his fingers,

06:29.857 --> 06:31.091
among other findings.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.126
Here's the bottom line,

06:33.193 --> 06:35.596
I suspect
he may have something
called Marfan Syndrome.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.531
Marfan Syndrome?

06:37.598 --> 06:40.033
Yes, a genetic disorder that
affects the body's tissue,

06:40.100 --> 06:42.335
which, depending on severity,
can prevent someone

06:42.402 --> 06:44.538
from engaging in rigorous
physical activity.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.707
Like basketball?
Well, possibly.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.208
Which is why I'm ordering
an echocardiogram

06:48.275 --> 06:49.409
to look at the heart

06:49.477 --> 06:51.445
and a whole battery of tests
to rule it out.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.981
But until then...

06:54.047 --> 06:55.883
I'm afraid
Danny can't play
basketball.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.451
What?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.219
No, basketball is my life.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.321
Trust me, Danny, I know.
I'm your biggest fan.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.256
But it's too big a risk.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.158
You see, Marfan Syndrome
affects the heart

07:05.225 --> 07:06.627
and its surrounding
blood vessels,

07:06.694 --> 07:09.096
and playing basketball
could result
in cardiac arrest.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.764
Whoa, whoa.
We came in
for his ankle.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.165
Now you're talking
about cardiac arrest?

07:12.232 --> 07:13.634
I've been playing
since I was little.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.302
And he's never had
an issue.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.705
Well, I'm relieved,
because if you do have it,

07:17.771 --> 07:18.972
you've been extremely lucky.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.808
This doesn't make
any sense.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.976
Why can't he play
until we find out for sure?

07:23.043 --> 07:25.479
You have to
treat it as Marfan
until you rule it out.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.647
It's that serious.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.782
How many cases of this
have you diagnosed?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.518
Well, none,
because it's...
None?

07:30.584 --> 07:32.185
So we're taking advice
from a guy

07:32.252 --> 07:34.221
who has zero experience
in this area.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.355
No, because it's rare.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.824
This guy's a quack!

07:36.890 --> 07:37.925
I told you
we shouldn't have
come to him!

07:37.991 --> 07:38.992
He's crazy!

07:39.059 --> 07:40.293
He's been kicked out
of four games

07:40.360 --> 07:41.729
for yelling at the ref.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.664
It's my medical opinion

07:43.731 --> 07:45.699
that he should
have his eyes checked.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.867
Whatever.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.236
Mr. Willis, I have to
let the school know.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.438
I can't clear your son
to play.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.306
No, Dr. Park,
you can't do this to me.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.443
I'm sorry.
I have to.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.445
Let's get out of here.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.283
*

08:12.993 --> 08:14.161
Hey.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.629
Oh, oh!
Close your eyes.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.198
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

08:18.265 --> 08:19.667
Yeah? Yeah?

08:19.733 --> 08:21.268
Okay, but if
I'm being kidnapped,

08:21.334 --> 08:23.470
can I pack
an overnight bag?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.606
Okay.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.840
And...open!

08:26.907 --> 08:27.941
(GASPS)

08:28.008 --> 08:30.010
What? What?

08:31.579 --> 08:32.746
Yay!

08:33.380 --> 08:37.317
You...made a mess!

08:37.384 --> 08:40.120
I'm making dinner
for our first night together.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.221
Oh.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.991
Baby, that is so sweet.
Thank you.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.092
I guess
I did make a mess.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.226
But you know
what they say,

08:46.293 --> 08:48.228
to make a mess,
you got to make a mess.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.763
Well, I guess
I'll just set the table.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.432
Oh, no need.
I figured we'd just eat
in front of the TV.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.601
We will?

08:53.667 --> 08:54.968
Yeah.
Who cares, right?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.738
Surely not me.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.306
Oh, it's gonna be
so great.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.441
So great.

09:01.508 --> 09:04.344
Oh! And you
peeled the potatoes
right into the sink.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.412
Yay!

09:05.478 --> 09:06.614
*

09:09.382 --> 09:10.517
Hey, boo.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.185
What's the haps, yo?

09:12.252 --> 09:13.286
(CHUCKLES)

09:15.088 --> 09:17.290
I think Danny Willis
might have Marfan Syndrome.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.026
Oh, no.
I know.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.227
I had to tell him
he couldn't play

09:20.293 --> 09:21.528
until we
figure it out.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.764
The test results
won't come back
for another two days,

09:23.831 --> 09:26.566
meaning they'll probably lose
the championship.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.501
Everyone's gonna hate me.
I'm gonna be an outcast.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.837
(INHALES DEEPLY)

09:29.903 --> 09:31.404
Maybe I'm being
overly cautious.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.505
He might not have it.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.641
I've never
diagnosed it before.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.842
It's so rare...
Ken.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.409
You did the right thing.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.947
Dad! You won't
let Danny play?

09:40.013 --> 09:41.348
Why do you
hate winning?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.686
Molly, Dad's a doctor.
He knows what he's doing.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.055
I'm sure he's diagnosed this
thousands of times.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.156
Right, Dad?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.225
Actually,
I've never diagnosed it.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.927
Well, I'm out.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.267
Yeah, Molly,
Danny could have
something serious.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.703
So we're just gonna
have to wait it out.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.138
I understand, Dad.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.140
But, just so you know,
not everyone does.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.443
The guys on the team
are not pleased with you.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.312
Molly, I'm a doctor.
I don't care about that.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.314
Which ones?

10:14.381 --> 10:16.650
Brayden, Jayden, Bryson,
the other Brayden.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.686
Whew! Thank God.
None of the starters.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.954
Let me finish.
Brendan, Brandon,
Brady, Brodie...

10:21.021 --> 10:22.322
Equipment manager Brodie
or mascot Brodie?

10:22.389 --> 10:23.390
Both.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.825
(GROANS)

10:24.892 --> 10:27.995
*

10:28.061 --> 10:30.664
Well, I am marrying
a lunatic.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.599
Are you quoting Connor?

10:32.666 --> 10:35.235
(LAUGHS)

10:35.302 --> 10:37.137
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

10:38.571 --> 10:40.674
He likes to eat dinner
after 8:00,

10:40.741 --> 10:43.276
which is fine
if we were living
in Barcelona!

10:44.377 --> 10:45.846
And this has never
come up before?

10:45.913 --> 10:47.815
Well, when we were dating,
it didn't seem
like a big deal.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.917
I didn't know
it was a way of life!

10:49.983 --> 10:52.452
He never puts the TV remotes
back in the remote caddy.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.187
Oh! Oh! Oh!

10:54.254 --> 10:57.424
And get this,
he is a dish-soaker.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.227
Yeah, a "Leave them
till the morning" dish-soaker.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.229
I had to get up
and sneak-wash dishes

11:02.295 --> 11:03.396
in the middle
of the night!

11:03.463 --> 11:04.932
Honey!
What?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.533
This sounds like
a you problem.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.668
(GASPING)
Look!

11:08.736 --> 11:10.904
You've lived alone
for some time now,

11:10.971 --> 11:12.639
and, you know, you're
pretty set in your ways.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.707
That is ridiculous.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.443
I'm as flexible
as Cirque du Soleil.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.545
Really?

11:18.611 --> 11:19.646
Give me your stapler.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.416
We're just gonna
keep this right here.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.423
Okay, I see
what you're doing.

11:30.490 --> 11:34.627
But the thing is,
my stapler is in
the ideal position for me

11:34.694 --> 11:36.229
to efficiently staple
my paperwork.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.664
Anywhere else, and I might
have to reach for it,

11:37.731 --> 11:39.266
and that is a nightmare

11:39.332 --> 11:40.600
that I would rather not
contemplate and...

11:40.667 --> 11:44.204
Oh, my God.
I am so set in my ways.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.438
How am I gonna
survive marriage

11:45.505 --> 11:47.074
if I can't even make it
through one night?

11:47.140 --> 11:49.342
Don't worry.
I will help you.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.211
How?
Oh, I'm gonna break you.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.581
We start today at lunch.

11:54.647 --> 11:55.648
See you at 1:00.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.284
Oh, yeah,
but I eat lunch at 12:30.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.585
I know.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.221

12:03.323 --> 12:05.192
(BOTH GIGGLE)

12:05.258 --> 12:06.626
Mmm!

12:06.693 --> 12:09.129
Girl, thank you for bringing
this coffee back into my life!

12:09.196 --> 12:10.430
(SIGHS)

12:10.497 --> 12:12.132
Thank you for abusing
your power as office manager

12:12.199 --> 12:13.400
to get us in here.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.501
Girl, please.
It's not the first time.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.136
Remember I sent out
that memo saying

12:16.203 --> 12:18.671
that the building was closed
because of "sewage problems"?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.608
It wasn't.
I wanted to go to Coachella.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.976
(LAUGHS)

12:23.043 --> 12:24.978
Do you think
it tastes even better
because it's forbidden?

12:25.045 --> 12:27.080
Perhaps.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.149
Allison made us do it!

12:29.216 --> 12:30.583
Wha...

12:32.953 --> 12:35.122
Using me for my coffee.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.791
And here I was,

12:37.858 --> 12:40.260
thinking you actually enjoyed
our chat the other day.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.761
I did!
You said that
very quickly,

12:41.829 --> 12:43.897
which makes me think
it's the caffeine talking.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.635
Guess I'll just take
my ball and go home.

12:48.701 --> 12:52.139
The ball being
my espresso machine.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.374
I got that.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.543
And I'm really sorry.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.247
Oh. Mind if
I just top this...

13:00.313 --> 13:01.915
I'll just go.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.886
*

13:05.953 --> 13:07.387
(LAUGHS)

13:11.291 --> 13:12.292
How are you liking it?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.595
The burrito
or the show?

13:15.662 --> 13:16.830
I was just...

13:16.897 --> 13:18.966
They're both happening
at the same time, so...

13:19.032 --> 13:21.034
it's hard to tell
which one you mean.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.370
Okay.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.605
Well, I think I'm getting
under your skin a little.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.942
What?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.444
(CHUCKLING) No. No.
I mean...

13:31.511 --> 13:33.780
I guess there might be
one or two tiny things.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.148
Okay. Like what?

13:35.715 --> 13:36.984
Um...

13:37.650 --> 13:39.052
like the dishes

13:39.119 --> 13:40.787
and the not-timely
washing of them.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.923
The remote and
the never-putting-back of it.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.025
The mealtimes and the utter
disregarding of them.
(CHUCKLES)

13:45.092 --> 13:46.093
What? What?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.694
Are these my issues,

13:47.760 --> 13:49.229
or is there a chance
these could be
your issues?

13:49.296 --> 13:51.364
Yeah, okay, see,
Damona said the same thing,

13:51.431 --> 13:52.565
but I'm actually
not so sure.
Whoa, whoa.

13:52.632 --> 13:53.633
You talked to Damona
about this?

13:53.700 --> 13:54.902
Yeah. Why?

13:54.968 --> 13:56.503
Well, 'cause I don't go
telling all my coworkers

13:56.569 --> 13:57.704
about all the problems
I have with you.

13:57.770 --> 13:58.906
That's because
you're unemployed.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.740
O... Okay.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.442
Look, I'm sorry.
I just...

14:02.509 --> 14:03.843
Wait. (CHUCKLES)

14:03.911 --> 14:05.145
You have problems with me?

14:05.212 --> 14:06.713
Let's just say
you're not the
easiest person

14:06.779 --> 14:07.847
to live with
in the world, either.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.049
Wow. Wow.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.451
That is the pot
calling the kettle wet,

14:11.518 --> 14:13.153
which, by the way,
totally makes sense

14:13.220 --> 14:14.787
because they've both
been soaking in the sink

14:14.854 --> 14:16.890
for the last
day and a half!

14:16.957 --> 14:18.291
Thank you
for proving my point.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.227
Do you have any idea
how rigid you can be?

14:20.293 --> 14:22.862
Rigid? I have to be rigid
to hold things together

14:22.930 --> 14:24.031
in the face
of Armageddon!

14:24.097 --> 14:26.366
You know what?
I'm gonna do
something crazy.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.434
I'm gonna eat
my burrito

14:27.500 --> 14:28.768
and continue watching
my show.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.503
Why not?
It's Armageddon!

14:30.570 --> 14:31.871
Oh! Oh!

14:33.706 --> 14:36.676
Well, I am going to eat
my burrito at the table,

14:36.743 --> 14:38.711
because I am not
a savage.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.819
What's going on?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.356
I just got
Danny's test results back.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.924
He has Marfan Syndrome.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.759
(SIGHS)
I'm so sorry, Ken.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.294
Hey.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.164
You were
right to trust
your instincts.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.032
Thanks, but that doesn't
make me feel any better.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.701

15:01.768 --> 15:02.769

guys off to?

15:02.835 --> 15:03.870
The basketball game.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.440
You're going, too?
You hate basketball.

15:07.507 --> 15:11.244
Yeah, but, you know,
any excuse to paint my face.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.747
That's awesome
you cleared Danny
to play, Dad.

15:14.814 --> 15:15.949
What?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.650
Yeah. Everyone's
so excited.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.751
People like you
again.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.653
No, I didn't clear Danny
to play.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.589
Well, I guess
someone did.

15:22.655 --> 15:23.856
(GASPS)
No, he can't play!

15:23.923 --> 15:25.058
I have to stop him.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.359
Go, Dad!

15:26.426 --> 15:28.795
Yeah!

15:30.097 --> 15:32.199

about dirty dishes

you quit your job,

you basically uprooted
your entire life
to come be with me.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.545
I was selfish
to make this about me.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.248

I really only care

your way or my way.

cleared you

I get it.

It's okay.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.700
But this isn't
an ankle sprain.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.836
This is life-or-death.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.379
They all had
structural heart problems

17:59.446 --> 18:02.315
and collapsed and died
right there on the court.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.783
Don't let that be
your legacy.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.886
There's more to life
than this.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.088
Which is why
I can't allow it.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.090
Even if that means
getting beaten up
by Jayden over there.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.492
I'm Brayden.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.760
Okay.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.228
Doc, I hear you,

18:15.295 --> 18:17.397
but maybe
we limit his minutes
and watch him closely.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.665
I, I mean,
it's just one game.

18:18.731 --> 18:19.766
Hold on.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.069
I could really die?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.372
Yes.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.909
Then I'm not playing.

18:29.976 --> 18:30.977
I'm so sorry.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.078
No, it's okay.
I'm okay, Dad.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.214
We should
have listened.
I'm okay.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.948
(SNIFFLES)

18:36.015 --> 18:37.049
(SIGHS)

18:40.887 --> 18:42.155
Go get 'em, guys.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.891
(SNIFFLES)

18:48.428 --> 18:50.730
Yeah! Go, Wolfpack!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.031
(HOWLS)

18:55.101 --> 18:56.135
What'd I miss?

18:56.203 --> 18:57.704
Good stuff, buddy.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.072
*

19:02.242 --> 19:03.676
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

19:05.212 --> 19:06.513
Oh.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.948
Did you come to retrieve
the knife you left in my back?

19:09.015 --> 19:11.351
Good luck.
It's in there pretty deep.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.953
I'm sorry, again.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.688
But I'd love
to make it up to you,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.056
if you could
tolerate coffee

19:17.123 --> 19:18.891
from the place
down the street.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.493
Aw.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.995
That's very kind of you.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.063
Thank you, Allison.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.366
So, can I stay
for a chat?

19:26.433 --> 19:27.700
Oh, you don't
have to do that.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.870
No, I told you,
I enjoyed the other day.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.906
I loved making fun
of my husband with you.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.276
(LAUGHS)
He just makes it so easy.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.380
All right, have a seat.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.549
Mmm.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.750
Not bad, right?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.419
Mmm. Motor oil.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.423
But I think
we can improve on it.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.128
She's still here.
Yeah.

19:56.195 --> 20:00.700
I had to hide it
from those who would
use me for my coffee.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.202
But for the worthy...

20:03.270 --> 20:04.271
Oh.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.638
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

20:05.705 --> 20:07.674
Tell me again about the time
Ken started wearing lifts.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.808
(CHUCKLING) Oh!

20:08.875 --> 20:10.443
He thought
no one would notice.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.511
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:11.578 --> 20:13.212
*

20:15.715 --> 20:16.849
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

20:17.517 --> 20:18.551
Hey, Danny.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.752
Come on in.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.588
Good to see you, man.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.122
Yeah, I, uh,
I just wanted to thank you

20:23.189 --> 20:25.692
for, you know,
saving my life.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.793
(CHUCKLES)

20:26.859 --> 20:28.495
I'm... sorry.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.662
My heart's broken, too.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.564
I know basketball
was your dream.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.632
Yeah.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.568
But I have a new dream.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.203
I want
to become a doctor,

20:37.270 --> 20:40.139
so that I can help people,
just like you helped me.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.075
Um...

20:43.142 --> 20:45.412
My God. Wow.
I don't know what to say.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.979
(CHUCKLES)
Well, maybe one day,

20:47.046 --> 20:48.881
you can help me out with
a letter of recommendation?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.249
Oh, you got it, man.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.985
'Cause I want to be the
Steph Curry of medicine, so...

20:53.052 --> 20:55.988
Ooh! So sorry.
That title's already taken.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.256
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:57.324 --> 20:58.791
Oh, and I, uh...

20:58.858 --> 21:00.493
I wanted
to give you this.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.531
It's not an NBA jersey,
but...

21:04.597 --> 21:06.366
No. Um...

21:06.433 --> 21:07.634
(SNIFFLES)

21:07.700 --> 21:09.336
This is so much better.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.538
Um... Wow.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.073
Thank you, man.
I... I'm sorry.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.576
I'm tearing up,
and I try to be so cool
in front of you.

21:16.643 --> 21:19.045
