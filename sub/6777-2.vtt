06:39.060 --> 06:41.051
BUT WITH THE DOUBLE COUPON
IT'S PRACTICALLY FREE.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.390
MAYBE THE BOYS

06:57.510 --> 06:59.717
I'm just checking

06:59.820 --> 07:02.209
I know what a drag it is
when you're out of work,

07:02.320 --> 07:05.710
thought you might want to come
up to Topanga for the day.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.210
I could make some of Aunt May's
German potato salad.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.084
I know you like that,
call me, bye.

07:12.190 --> 07:15.796
YOU LIKED
HER POTATO SALAD.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.198
I HATED IT.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.699
IT JUST...

07:26.810 --> 07:29.745
IT JUST NEVER
OCCURS TO YOU

07:29.850 --> 07:33.069
THAT A MADMAN WILL WALK
INTO YOUR HUSBAND'S OFFICE

07:33.180 --> 07:36.911
AND SUDDENLY...

07:37.020 --> 07:39.238
HE'S GONE.

07:39.350 --> 07:41.614
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

07:41.720 --> 07:46.259
AND THEN THERE'S
TELLING THE CHILDREN...

07:46.360 --> 07:48.453
WE HAVE TWO GIRLS,

07:48.560 --> 07:51.199
12 AND 16.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.394
WHAT SHOULD
I SAY TO THEM

07:54.500 --> 07:58.061
TO MAKE THEM
FEEL BE'I'I'ER ?

07:58.170 --> 08:00.707
WHAT ?

08:00.810 --> 08:03.244

08:17.560 --> 08:21.496
I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.989
I KNOW THOSE ARE
JUST WORDS, BUT...

08:24.100 --> 08:28.935
BUT WE'LL WORK TOGETHER WITH YOU
TO GIVE HIM A FITTING TRIBUTE.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.667
THANK YOU...

08:30.770 --> 08:33.500
EVERYTHING'S ALREADY
BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.

08:33.610 --> 08:36.078

08:36.180 --> 08:38.546
OKAY.

08:38.650 --> 08:42.780
THEN LET ME
WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.191
I DIDN'T EVEN
GO TO MY PROM.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.962
IF SOMEBODY HAD ASKED ME I
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FREAKED OUT.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.492
I TOOK NANCY POLLARD.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.329
SHE SMELLED
LIKE FRIED CHICKEN.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.169
WHY ?

09:03.270 --> 09:06.307
I DON'T KNOW,
SHE JUST DID.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.699
I GOT A BOTI'LE OF CHAMPAGNE
WITH MY FRIEND PARKER

09:10.810 --> 09:13.677
AND WE CLIMBED
THE FENCE TO SCHOOL,

09:13.780 --> 09:15.714
AND WE JUST
SAT IN THE QUAD,

09:15.820 --> 09:19.449
AND GOT DRUNK, AND SAID GOOD
FUCKING BYE TO HIGH SCHOOL.

09:19.550 --> 09:20.949
NICE.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.789
THEN WE BOTH
TOTALLY STARTED CRYING.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.585
WHY ?

09:24.690 --> 09:27.625
I DON'T KNOW.

09:27.730 --> 09:31.166
I GUESS WE WERE LIKE SAYING
GOODBYE TO OUR CHILDHOOD,

09:31.270 --> 09:33.192
OR WHATEVER.

09:33.300 --> 09:37.202
IT JUST
SEEMED SAD.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.706
YEAH ?

09:41.810 --> 09:43.607
I MEAN, I HATED
FUCKING HIGH SCHOOL,

09:43.710 --> 09:45.541
BUT STILL...

09:45.650 --> 09:47.515
IT WAS MY LIFE.

09:47.620 --> 09:51.943
IT WAS ALL I KNEW,
AND NOW IT WAS JUST OVER.

09:54.460 --> 09:57.327
GOD, COULD I BE
ANYMORE PATHETIC ?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.250
YOU'RE NOT PATHETIC.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.453
YOU'RE JUST
SENSITIVE.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.198
I KNOW.

10:03.300 --> 10:04.767
I'M TOO SENSITIVE.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.761
NO, YOU'RE PERFECT.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.207
WHAT TIME DO YOU
HAVE TO GET UP ?

10:12.310 --> 10:17.577
OH FUCK, I HAVE TO GET UP
IN LIKE THREE HOURS.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.410
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN DONE
THE ASSIGNMENT YET.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.738
YOU KEEP
DISTRACTING ME.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.215
I KEEP
DISTRACTING YOU ?

10:24.320 --> 10:27.209
YEAH, MY HANDS ARE LIKE
MAGNETICALLY DRAWN TO YOUR DICK.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.311
WHAT IS
THE ASSIGNMENT ?

10:29.420 --> 10:32.480
I HAVE TO READ
AND CRITIQUE

10:32.590 --> 10:35.252
SOME THEORETICAL
CONCEPTUAL BULLSHIT.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.965
THEY MAKE YOU TAKE ALL
THE BORING CLASSES WITH THEORY

10:38.070 --> 10:40.288
BEFORE THEY LET YOU DO
ANYTHING COOL WITH CLAY.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.628
I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.059
NO, YOU DON'T.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.762
THAT'S WHY I DROPPED
OUT OF MUSIC SCHOOL.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.531
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS
WRITE GREAT MUSIC,

10:46.640 --> 10:49.074
BUT THEY HAD ME
STUDYING ALL THIS SHIT

10:49.180 --> 10:51.705
THAT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.619
THEY TRY TO PROGRAM
YOUR MIND

10:53.720 --> 10:56.314
SO YOU'RE EXACTLY
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

10:56.420 --> 10:59.139
DON'T LET THEM
DO THAT TO YOU.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.309
YOU'RE TOO TALENTED.

11:01.420 --> 11:04.150
DO YOU THINK SO ?

11:04.260 --> 11:08.321
WHAT, YOU THINK
I LIKE YOU JUST 'CAUSE

11:08.430 --> 11:09.988
YOU HAVE
THE SOFI'EST SKIN

11:10.100 --> 11:12.091
I'VE EVER FELT ?

11:12.200 --> 11:13.428
I DON'T KNOW...

11:13.540 --> 11:17.328
YOU'RE AMAZING,
CLAIRE.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.977
H ELLO,
BEAUTIFUL LADIES.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.047
GOOD MORNING.

11:28.150 --> 11:29.515
THANK YOU FOR
LE'I'I'ING ME SLEEP IN.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.384
DOES YOUR BROTHER
LIKE EGGPLANT ?

11:32.490 --> 11:35.084
UHM, I DON'T KNOW.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.214
I GUESS.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.790
I FIGURED WE COULD GRILL
SOME SALMON TONIGHT,

11:39.900 --> 11:41.299
I JUST DON'T
KNOW WHAT ELSE.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.992
IS THAT TONIGHT ?

11:43.100 --> 11:44.226
YES.

11:44.330 --> 11:45.399
CAN WE CANCEL ?

11:45.500 --> 11:46.933
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.565
I KNOW, AND IT SOUNDED
GOOD AT THE TIME, BUT

11:49.670 --> 11:51.763
I SEE DAVID
AT WORK EVERY DAY,

11:51.870 --> 11:53.701
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M DYING TO SPEND

11:53.810 --> 11:55.277
SOME QUALITY TIME
WITH KEITH.

11:55.380 --> 11:56.847
YOU WANTED DAVID
TO SEE MAYA.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.272
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE'LL DO IT.

12:00.380 --> 12:03.713
YOUR UNCLE DAVID'S COMING OVER,
WON'T THAT BE FUN, HUH ?

12:03.820 --> 12:07.415

12:10.930 --> 12:14.058
I'LL TRY
ONCE MORE.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.526
THANK YOU.

12:16.630 --> 12:19.519
LISA, YOU'RE BEING
CAREFUL, RIGHT ?

12:19.630 --> 12:22.064
I'M BEING
VERY DELICATE.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.502
HEY, MAYA.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.976
MAYA.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.402
HONEY, REALLY, I THINK
YOU'RE GOING TOO DEEP.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.114
NATE, YOU WORRY
TOO MUCH.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.677
JUST BECAUSE YOU DEAL WITH
PEOPLE DYING EVERY DAY--

12:35.780 --> 12:37.543
LOOK, I'VE NOTICED
THAT SOMETIMES

12:37.650 --> 12:38.719
AFTER YOU CLEAN
HER EARS,

12:38.820 --> 12:40.014
SHE DOESN'T
RESPOND AS QUICKLY, AND--

12:40.120 --> 12:41.348
SO, YOU THINK
I'VE INJURED HER ?

12:41.460 --> 12:43.087
OF COURSE NOT,
I'M JUST SAYING THAT MAYBE

12:43.190 --> 12:45.385
THERE'S SOME RINGING IN HER EARS
AFTER YOU CLEAN THEM.

12:45.490 --> 12:46.582
NATE.

12:46.690 --> 12:48.123
I KNOW WHETHER MY CHILD
CAN HEAR OR NOT.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.049
AND SHE CAN HEAR.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.491
SHE'S BEEN TESTED
AND SHE CAN HEAR.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.397
RIGHT, YOUR CHILD.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.899
I DIDN'T MEAN--

12:54.000 --> 12:55.365
LOOK, I KNOW
I'M JUST THE FATHER,

12:55.470 --> 12:56.698
BUT I'M EVERY BIT AS COMMITTED
TO HER AS YOU ARE.

12:56.810 --> 12:57.765
NATE--

12:57.870 --> 12:58.768
I'M JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.407
I GO'ITA

13:09.520 --> 13:10.942
Please leave
a message.

13:11.050 --> 13:14.156
( Sarah )
Ruth, it's Sarah.

13:14.260 --> 13:18.048
I'm disappointed
you didn't call back.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.254
I'll be honest, I was trying to
trick you into coming out here.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.965
I need you.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.630
I hurt my back
and I'm all alone--

13:26.730 --> 13:28.539
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

13:28.640 --> 13:31.700
I FELL OFF A LADDER.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.368
Have you
seen a doctor ?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.233
HE TOLD ME
TO STAY IN BED

13:36.340 --> 13:39.104
AND HE GAVE ME
A PRESCRIPTION FOR VICODIN.

13:39.210 --> 13:41.519
WHAT DO YOU
sNEED ME TO DO ?

13:41.620 --> 13:43.178
Pick it up for me ?

13:43.290 --> 13:47.010
GIVE ME THE ADDRESS
OF THE PHARMACY.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.155
OH RUTH,

13:48.260 --> 13:52.287
I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON YOU.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.621
ARE YOU DOING
THIS WITH ME ?

13:58.730 --> 14:00.368
YES.

14:00.470 --> 14:03.030
I CAN DO IT
MYSELF, DAVID.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.734
WELL, I'M SURE
THAT'S TRUE.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.603
BUT NATE AND I HAVE
FOUND IT'S HELPFUL

14:07.710 --> 14:09.109
TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE
IN THERE.

14:09.210 --> 14:13.647
WHY, SO ONE OF YOU
CAN SLEEP LATE ?

14:13.750 --> 14:17.186
AND OF COURSE, WE'LL PLACE AN
OBITUARY NOTICE IN THE PAPER.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.643
NO.

14:18.750 --> 14:23.824
WE'D LIKE TO KEEP THIS PRIVATE
AND AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.

14:23.930 --> 14:27.252
YOU SEE THIS KIND OF
THING ON T-V,

14:27.360 --> 14:29.157
AND YOU THINK,

14:29.260 --> 14:31.490
OH MY GOD,
THOSE POOR PEOPLE...

14:31.600 --> 14:35.331
BUT NOW IT'S
HAPPENING TO US,

14:35.440 --> 14:42.630
AND WE HAVE TO SEE IT
EVERY TIME WE TURN IT ON...

14:47.820 --> 14:49.117
THANK YOU.

14:49.220 --> 14:53.509
WE KNEW THAT DANIEL
WAS A TROUBLED BOY,

14:53.620 --> 14:56.453
BUT WE REALLY THOUGHT
HE WAS GETI'ING BETI'ER.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.792
YOUR SON ISN'T THE ONE
WHO DID THE SHOOTING... ?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.697
YES.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.768
I'M SORRY,
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY--

15:04.870 --> 15:07.259
IMAGINE WHAT YOU MUST
BE GOING THROUGH,

15:07.370 --> 15:10.362
BUT YOU CAN
REST ASSURED,

15:10.470 --> 15:14.509
WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO
HELP YOU THROUGH THIS DARK TIME.

15:14.610 --> 15:17.249
THANK YOU.

15:19.380 --> 15:22.019
FISHER AND SONS HAS NEVER
TURNED DOWN A FUNERAL,

15:22.120 --> 15:24.281
AND NEITHER WILL
FISHER AND DIAZ.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.483
OH, THAT'S GREAT, THAT'S GREAT,
SO YOU KNOW WHAT ?

15:26.590 --> 15:28.512
WHEN DOROTHY MILNE IS CRYING
OVER HER HUSBAND'S CASKET

15:28.620 --> 15:30.679
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL HER
THAT YOU'RE IN THE NEXT ROOM

15:30.790 --> 15:33.020
ARRANGING FLOWERS AROUND
THE FUCKING MAN WHO KILLED HIM.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.052
THE SERVICES WILL BE
HELD ON DIFFERENT DAYS.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.320
THERE WILL BE
NO CONFLICT.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.990
OH C'MON MAN, I KNOW
YOU LIKE TO MAKE A BUCK,

15:39.100 --> 15:40.692
BUT ISN'T THIS GOING
A LITTLE FAR ?

15:40.800 --> 15:42.028
THAT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.734
THE FUNERAL
ISN'T FOR THE DECEASED,

15:44.840 --> 15:45.807
IT'S FOR THE LIVING.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.036
OH REALLY ?

15:47.140 --> 15:48.209
YEAH, I READ
THE SAME BOOK AS YOU.

15:48.310 --> 15:51.279
DO YOU THINK
MR. AND MRS. SHOWALTER

15:51.380 --> 15:52.972
ARE IN ANY LESS PAIN
THAN DOROTHY MILNE ?

15:53.080 --> 15:55.344
MAYBE I DON'T
GIVE A SHIT.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.486
MAYBE IF THEY DID A BETTER JOB
IN RAISING THEIR KID

15:57.590 --> 15:59.512
HE WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED
ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

15:59.620 --> 16:00.848
RICO, YOU CAN'T
BLAME THEM.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.657
YES, I CAN BLAME THEM
AND I DO.

16:07.430 --> 16:12.060
WELL, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT, THIS IS YOUR JOB.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.297
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO PUT YOUR FEELINGS ASIDE.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.265
NOW, I NEED YOU TO GO TO
THE MORGUE AND PICK UP HIS BODY.

16:16.370 --> 16:17.769
FUCK YOU,
YOU PICK IT UP.

16:17.870 --> 16:20.430
I GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.021
OH, HELLO, I'M RUTH,
SARAH'S SISTER.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.961
WELL, TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T
GET HERE FIVE MINUTES AGO.

16:47.070 --> 16:48.594
YOU COULD HAVE
CLEANED UP HER PUKE.

16:48.700 --> 16:52.534
I'M BETTINA,
COME ON IN.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.000
SARAH,
YOUR SISTER'S HERE !

17:05.950 --> 17:07.918
RUTH !

17:08.020 --> 17:10.420
MY GOODNESS,

17:10.530 --> 17:13.693
BETTINA, CAN WE
HAVE A MOMENT ALONE ?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.121
WHY ?

17:16.230 --> 17:19.427
BECAUSE SHE'S MY SISTER
AND WE NEED TO TALK.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.031
WHAT'S IN THE BAG ?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.368
IT'S JUST THE--

17:22.470 --> 17:24.108
SOME THINGS I ASKED HER
TO BRING FOR ME.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.475
LIP BALM, HAIR CLIPS,
STRAWBERRIES...

17:27.580 --> 17:29.673
WELL, NO--

17:29.780 --> 17:30.644
FORK IT OVER.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.739
RUTH, QUICKLY !

17:31.850 --> 17:33.841
RUTH, HELP ME !

17:33.950 --> 17:35.372

OR I'LL GODDAMN TAPE IT SHUT !

17:37.990 --> 17:39.719
GOODNESS,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

17:39.820 --> 17:41.185
RUTH, PLEASE !

17:41.290 --> 17:42.552
DO I HAVE TO CARRY
YOU BACK TO THE BED

17:42.660 --> 17:44.753
OR ARE YOU GOING
TO WALK BY YOURSELF ?

17:44.860 --> 17:45.986
HUH ?

17:46.090 --> 17:48.229
HUH ?

17:49.560 --> 17:51.824
BITCH .

17:51.930 --> 17:54.933
GIVE ME THE BAG.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.099
IT'S HER VICODIN.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.734
SHE HAS
A PRESCRIPTION.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.330
OF COURSE SHE DOES.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.476
SHE HAS VICODIN PRESCRIPTIONS
AT HALF THE PHARMACIES IN LA.

18:02.580 --> 18:05.048
OH.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.243
YOUR SISTER'S INTO HER
SECOND DAY OF WITHDRAWAL.

18:07.350 --> 18:09.841
SHE BEGGED ME TO MAKE SURE
SHE GOT THROUGH IT

18:09.950 --> 18:11.349
NO MATTER WHAT !

18:11.450 --> 18:14.487
FUCK THAT,
I WAS HIGH !

18:17.630 --> 18:19.951
I'm sorry, Keith, I'm having
problems at the morgue.

18:20.060 --> 18:21.652
WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL ME BEFORE ?

18:21.760 --> 18:23.523
Because I didn't know this
was gomg to take so long.

18:23.630 --> 18:25.063
I'm sorry.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.922
FINE, WHATEVER.

18:27.030 --> 18:29.191
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.336
HE CAN'T MAKE IT.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.374
SORRY FOR
WASTING YOUR TIME.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.209
YOU DON'T
NEED TO LEAVE.

18:35.310 --> 18:38.746
YOU AND I CAN TALK.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.013
WE CAN DO THAT ?

18:43.120 --> 18:45.816
SURE, WHY NOT ?

18:52.560 --> 18:53.925
TELL ME ABOUT
THAT PHONE CALL,

18:54.030 --> 18:55.850
HOW DID IT
MAKE YOU FEEL ?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.224
PISSED OFF.

18:58.330 --> 19:01.299
BUT I'M WORKING ON MY ANGER
MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.664
TAKING A LOT
OF DEEP BREATHS.

19:03.770 --> 19:05.431
THAT'S GOOD.

19:05.540 --> 19:08.634
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING A LOT OF
ANGER TOWARD DAVID LATELY ?

19:08.740 --> 19:11.277
I'VE BEEN GIVING MYSELF
SO MANY DAMN TIME-OUTS

19:11.380 --> 19:13.746
I HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING
MUCH OF ANYTHING, JUST NUMB.

19:13.850 --> 19:16.512
MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD TIME
TO LET SOME OF THAT ANGER OUT.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.509
I'M FINE.

19:19.620 --> 19:22.350
PRETEND DAVID'S SITTING
RIGHT THERE NEXT TO YOU.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.553
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO SAY TO HIM ?

19:24.660 --> 19:29.222
ANYTHING THAT
COMES TO MIND.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.232
RELAX.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.207
STOP TRYING SO HARD,
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.234
WHAT OTHER THINGS WOULD
YOU LIKE TO TELL HIM

19:40.340 --> 19:43.571
THAT YOU DON'T
LIKE ABOUT HIM ?

19:49.720 --> 19:54.851
I HATE YOUR STUPID
LITTLE BUCKWHEAT PILLOW.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.622
AND I HATE YOUR...

19:57.730 --> 19:59.755
NOSE SPRAY.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.623
I HATE THE WAY YOU EAT,
YOU TAKE LITTLE BITTY BITES

20:01.730 --> 20:03.994
AND THEN YOU PUT DOWN YOUR FORK
AFTER EVERY LITTLE BITE

20:04.100 --> 20:05.761
LIKE YOU'RE SOME
FUCKING PRINCE !

20:05.870 --> 20:07.428
I HATE THE WAY YOU ALWAYS
WANT TO FALL ASLEEP

20:07.540 --> 20:09.269
WITH YOUR HEAD
ON MY SHOULDER.

20:09.370 --> 20:11.008
YOUR HEAD IS HEAW.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.931
I HATE THE WAY YOU ALWAYS
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I'M MY FATHER,

20:14.040 --> 20:16.907
BY LETTING ME
WALK ALL OVER YOU.

20:17.810 --> 20:19.346
WHAT ?

20:19.450 --> 20:24.012
I ALWAYS THOUGHT BY BEING GAY
I'D AVOID FUCKING MY MOTHER,

20:24.120 --> 20:25.849
BUT I GUESS
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

20:25.950 --> 20:31.820
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT SEEING
A THERAPIST ON YOUR OWN ?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.362
WOW, THIS IS GREAT.

20:42.470 --> 20:44.859
IT'S MY POLENTA,
YOU LIKE IT ?

20:44.970 --> 20:46.062
IT'S DELICIOUS.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.102
THANK YOU.

20:47.210 --> 20:49.132

20:49.240 --> 20:51.879

20:51.980 --> 20:53.675
Hi, it's Carol.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.419
HELLO ?

20:56.520 --> 21:00.456
LISA, I'M AT MARK HARMON AND PAM
DAWBER'S PLACE IN THE MOUNTAINS.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.084
LISTEN, THEIR COOK
KNOWS NOTHING.

21:02.190 --> 21:04.055
I NEED YOU TO WALK HIM
THROUGH YOUR BASIL VINAIGRETTE.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.184
Right now ?

21:05.290 --> 21:07.850
YES, THE SALAD'S
WAITING.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.258
WHAT ?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.793
I'VE GOT TO DEAL
WITH THIS.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.095
OKAY, GO AHEAD,
I'LL START THE GRILL.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.838
I STILL HAVE A LOAD
OF LAUNDRY TO DO.

21:16.940 --> 21:17.907
I'LL DO IT, GO.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.069
Lisa ?

21:20.170 --> 21:20.807
HEY, LIS,

21:20.910 --> 21:22.332
Lisa ?!

21:22.440 --> 21:23.998
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.042
OH, GOD, ME TOO.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.276
Are you
still there ?

21:26.380 --> 21:27.711
I JUST WORRY
ABOUT MAYA.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.276
I GET SO SCARED SOMETHING'S
GOING TO GO WRONG.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.312
NOTHING'S GOING
TO GO WRONG.

21:30.420 --> 21:31.682
Salad dressing !

21:31.790 --> 21:33.951
I KNOW, MAYA HAS
THE BEST MOM IN THE WORLD.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.254
Hello !?

21:35.360 --> 21:36.384
UH-HUH.

21:36.490 --> 21:38.651

21:38.760 --> 21:40.853
I MEAN, GABE WAS
DEFINITELY EXCITING

21:40.960 --> 21:43.360
IN KIND OF
A SICK WAY.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.268
I THINK PHIL'S LIKE,
THE ONLY GUY

21:46.370 --> 21:48.235
WHO'S EVER REALLY
UNDERSTOOD ME.

21:48.340 --> 21:49.637
THAT'S COOL.

21:49.740 --> 21:51.435
NOT EVEN MY IMAGINARY
FRIENDS UNDERSTAND ME.

21:51.540 --> 21:54.100
OR MAYBE THEY DO,
THEY JUST DON'T LIKE ME.

21:54.210 --> 21:56.701
I THINK YOU NEED BETTER
IMAGINARY FRIENDS.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.607
NO, I THINK THEY'RE
THE BEST I CAN DO.

21:58.710 --> 22:01.873
SO, WHAT DO YOU REALLY
LIKE ABOUT THIS GUY ?

22:01.980 --> 22:03.880
I DON'T KNOW...

22:03.990 --> 22:06.845
HE'S SWEET.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.781
HE'S HOT.

22:08.890 --> 22:10.118
NICE.

22:10.220 --> 22:11.653
HE'S GOT HIS OWN BAND.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.694
IT'S KEANU REEVES,
ISN'T IT ?

22:13.800 --> 22:14.926
YES, EXACTLY.

22:15.030 --> 22:16.429
I KNEW IT.

22:16.530 --> 22:18.760
BUT COME ON, CLAIRE,
THOSE ARE SUPERFICIAL THINGS.

22:18.870 --> 22:22.237
AND YOU SEEM LIKE ANYTHING,
BUT SUPERFICIAL.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.705
SO...

22:23.810 --> 22:25.766
WHAT DO YOU REALLY
LIKE ABOUT HIM ?

22:25.870 --> 22:28.771
WELL,

22:28.880 --> 22:32.475
I LIKE THE WAY
HE TREATS ME, YOU KNOW ?

22:32.580 --> 22:35.913
HE MAKES ME FEEL GOOD,
LIKE I'M KIND OF OKAY...

22:36.020 --> 22:39.842
LIKE I'M SMART AND...

22:39.950 --> 22:42.657
TALENTED AND PRETTY.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.150
HELLO...

22:46.260 --> 22:47.921
TOTALLY EM BARRASSING.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.567
NO, NO, NO, WOMEN TELL ME THIS
KIND OF THING ALL THE TIME.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.262
I'M THE GUY
WHO LISTENS.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.691
YEAH, YOU DO LISTEN...

22:54.800 --> 22:57.963
THAT'S REALLY
NICE ABOUT YOU.

22:58.070 --> 22:59.435
I REALLY LIKE
TALKING TO YOU.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.508
I LIKE
LISTENING TO YOU.

23:01.610 --> 23:03.373
WELL, I HOPE IT COULD
GO BOTH WAYS.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.778
IF YOU'RE DATING ANYONE,
YOU CAN TOTALLY TALK TO ME.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.314
THANKS, BUT NO,
I'M NOT DATING.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.648
NO DATING.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.581
I THINK I'M KIND OF
ALLERGIC, ACTUALLY.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.954
I START ITCHING
AND I SWELL UP

23:14.060 --> 23:16.210
AND BLEED PROFUSY.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.585
BUT NO, IT SOUNDS
REALLY NICE.

23:19.690 --> 23:22.750
HAVING SOMEBODY
IN YOUR LIFE

23:22.860 --> 23:24.828
THAT MAKES YOU HATE
YOURSELF LESS.

23:24.930 --> 23:26.466
I COULD USE THAT.

23:26.570 --> 23:28.037
OH COME ON, I MEAN,
YOU'RE GREAT.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.562
I WASN'T FISHING.

23:29.670 --> 23:31.729
I'M SERIOUS, RUSSELL,
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.729
WELL, TELL ME THAT WHEN
IT'S TWO IN THE MORNING

23:34.840 --> 23:37.377
AND I'M LAYING IN BED AND I'M
EATING MY FOURTH BOWL OF CEREAL,

23:37.480 --> 23:40.608
AND I'M JUST BEATING
MYSELF UP FOR SOME

23:40.720 --> 23:44.110
STUPID THING I SAID
IN THE EIGHTH GRADE.

23:44.220 --> 23:46.518
WHAT KIND
OF CEREAL ?

23:46.620 --> 23:48.656
CAPTAIN CRUNCH.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.057
OH MY GOD,

23:50.160 --> 23:52.754
I THINK WE'RE TWINS.

23:57.100 --> 24:00.422
I DON'T KNOW, THIS WHOLE,
"OOPS, I'M PREGNANT" THING

24:00.540 --> 24:02.394
STILL SOUNDS KIND
OF SUSPICIOUS TO ME.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.899
I'M JUST SURPRISED
HE MARRIED HER,

24:04.010 --> 24:06.865
BUT IF NATE'S HAPPY,
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

24:06.970 --> 24:10.508
SO, ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME
ABOUT THIS MORNING ?

24:10.610 --> 24:12.475
I'M REALLY SORRY
I MISSED THERAPY.

24:12.580 --> 24:15.117
NO, I WAS HAPPY
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.017
FRANK WAS TOO.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.644
FRANK LOVES ME !

24:18.750 --> 24:21.014
YEAH, BUT HE THINKS YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON YOURSELF.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.781
THAT'S SO NOT TRUE !

24:22.890 --> 24:26.485
I MEAN, MAYBE IT'S TRUE,
BUT HE'D NEVER SAY THAT.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.024
SO, DID YOU TALK ABOUT ME
THE WHOLE TIME ?

24:29.130 --> 24:31.598
AI-TER WE BOTH DECIDED
YOU WERE A HOPELESS,

24:31.700 --> 24:33.691
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
GUILT SPONGE

24:33.800 --> 24:36.394
WE DECIDED TO MOVE ON
TO MORE IMPORTANT THINGS.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.207
GOD, I'M NEVER GONNA
MISS THERAPY AGAIN.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.870
YOU BET YOU WON'T,
BITCH.

24:44.550 --> 24:47.519
( laughing )

24:49.120 --> 24:51.714
WELL, HELLO.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.350
NATE.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.358
HEY DAVE,
HOW ARE YOU ?

24:55.460 --> 24:56.415
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.819
KEITH,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.225
LISA USED TO BURN
THE FUCK OUT OF EVERYTHING

25:03.330 --> 25:07.664
UNTIL I DISCOVERED
THE MIRACLE OF LOW, EVEN HEAT.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.331
THE SECRET IS
MESQUITE WOOD CHIPS.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.737
GOTTA USE MESQUITE.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.434
NO, MAN,
THAT'S JUST A GIMMICK.

25:15.540 --> 25:17.679
IT'S THE MARINADE THAT
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.715
I JUST LIKE
WEARING THE APRON.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.776
NATE,

25:22.880 --> 25:24.780
WHERE DID YOU
PUT HER BLUE BLANKIE ?

25:24.890 --> 25:27.245
IT TOOK FOREVER
TO PUT HER DOWN.

25:27.350 --> 25:28.749
YOU KNOW SHE CAN'T
SLEEP WITHOUT IT.

25:28.860 --> 25:29.713
I DIDN'T
PUT IT ANYWHERE.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.219
I COULDN'T
FIND IT.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.820
DID YOU GIVE
HER MISTER FAT FANNY ?

25:32.930 --> 25:33.828
SHE LIKES HIM.

25:33.930 --> 25:35.420
HE'S IN HER SWEET
LITTLE HANDS.

25:35.530 --> 25:37.919
ALRIGHT.

25:38.030 --> 25:41.033
I THINK WE'RE READY.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.260
LET ME GO WASH UP.

25:44.370 --> 25:46.099
WHERE'S YOUR
LITTLE BOYS' ROOM ?

25:46.210 --> 25:49.737
THE BATHROOM IS IN THE BACK,
BEHIND THE KITCHEN.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.876
BUT DON'T
FLUSH THE TOILET.

25:51.980 --> 25:53.618
WE DON'T WANT
TO WAKE MAYA.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.678
SO, HOW'S
THE CHOIR GOING ?

25:56.780 --> 26:00.181
WELL, IT'S NOT A CHOIR,
IT'S A CHORUS,

26:00.290 --> 26:01.814
BUT IT'S GOING WELL.

26:01.920 --> 26:02.682
GREAT.

26:02.790 --> 26:04.121
I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR YOU.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.879
OH, NO EGGPLANT
FOR ME.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.254
I'LL TAKE HIS.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.965
MOZZARELLA ?

26:11.070 --> 26:12.958
YES.

26:49.170 --> 26:51.434
( flushing )

26:51.540 --> 26:53.929
( baby crying )

26:54.040 --> 26:55.507
GREAT.

26:55.610 --> 26:57.646
I'LL GO.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.211
WHAT'D I MISS ?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.571
YOU WOKE THE BABY.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.284
IT WASN'T ASLEEP.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.482
YES, IT WAS.

27:05.590 --> 27:06.943
IT WASN'T.

27:07.050 --> 27:08.586
IT LOOKED AT ME
WHEN I WENT IN.

27:08.690 --> 27:09.884
(Uw)
Damn, I told him
not to flush.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.287
( Nate )
Maybe he had
to flush.

27:11.390 --> 27:13.051
David said he had that
irritable bowel thing.

27:13.160 --> 27:13.990
Ew.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.022
WHY DID YOU
TELL HIM THAT ?

27:16.130 --> 27:17.791
IT JUST CAME UP.

27:17.900 --> 27:19.629
WELL, PLEASE DON'T DISCUSS
MY PRIVATE STU WITH ANYONE.

27:19.730 --> 27:21.038
I'M SORRY.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.767
We're never going
to get her back to sleep.

27:22.870 --> 27:24.360
AND BY THE WAY,
I ONLY PEED.

27:24.470 --> 27:25.698
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE FLUSHED.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.869
IT WASN'T ASLEEP !

27:27.980 --> 27:30.608
* Maya,
row the boat ashore *

27:30.710 --> 27:33.838
* Hallelujah

27:33.950 --> 27:37.169
* Maya,
row the boat ashore *

27:37.280 --> 27:40.147
* Hallelujah

27:40.250 --> 27:44.289
* My brothers and sisters
are all aboard *

27:44.390 --> 27:45.584
( laughing )

27:45.690 --> 27:48.352
THAT SONG HAS NEVER
SOUNDED SO CREEPY BEFORE.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.688
I KNOW.

27:49.800 --> 27:55.261
* are all aboard
halleIUJah *

28:13.590 --> 28:15.581
YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

28:15.690 --> 28:17.282
WHAT IS
HE DOING HERE ?

28:17.390 --> 28:18.982
HEY, WASN'T MY IDEA.

28:19.090 --> 28:22.059
OOH, LOOK AT YOU,
IN YOUR FANCY FUCKING SUIT.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.094
I KNEW I NEVER
SHOULD HAVE HIRED YOU.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.225
NO, WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IS FIRE ME.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.763
YOU WERE A FUCK UP.

28:27.870 --> 28:30.361
JESUS, COULD YOU HAVE MADE
THE HOLE A LITTLE BIGGER ?

28:30.470 --> 28:32.631
WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS SHOOT
YOURSELVES IN THE HEART

28:32.740 --> 28:34.037
ONCE IN A WHILE ?

28:34.140 --> 28:35.869
MAYBE I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

28:35.980 --> 28:39.507
BESIDES, IT'S REALLY
NOT MY PROBLEM.

28:39.610 --> 28:41.441
OH YEAH,
NOTHING'S YOUR PROBLEM.

28:41.550 --> 28:42.869
BLOW ME, DEAD MAN.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.686
HE HAD A WIFE
AND KIDS, ASSHOLE.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.815
LUCKY HIM,
I DIDN'T HAVE SHIT.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.057
SO, WHOSE
FAULT IS THAT ?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.912
YOU COULDN'T EVEN SHOW UP
TO WORK ON TIME.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.250
MAYBE IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
SUCH A GODDAMN PRICK.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.191
IT'S BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU
THAT I HAD TO DO THIS.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.723
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THIS IS MY FAULT ?

28:56.830 --> 28:58.969
I'M JUST SAYING...

28:59.070 --> 29:02.289
A GUY CAN TAKE ONLY
SO MUCH BEFORE HE SNAPS.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.799
HEY, HEY !

29:03.910 --> 29:06.333
YOU KNOW, WE ALL HAVE
TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF SHIT,

29:06.440 --> 29:07.771
ALRIGHT ?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.768
BUT WHEN I SNAP,
I THROW SOMETHING

29:09.880 --> 29:11.177
OR I PUNCH A WALL,

29:11.280 --> 29:13.373
I DON'T PICK UP A SHOTGUN
AND START KILLING PEOPLE.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.176
YEAH...

29:16.280 --> 29:19.044
SO FAR.

29:22.190 --> 29:25.284
GOD, IT FEELS SO GOOD TO SIT
HERE AND DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.654
WE RELAX
ALL THE TIME.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.251
YOU HAVE TO.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.036
SO, HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR NEW JOB, KEITH ?

29:39.140 --> 29:43.236
UH, WELL,
IT PRETTY MUCH SUCKS.

29:43.340 --> 29:46.070
IT'S TEMPORARY.

29:46.180 --> 29:48.341
WE'RE BOTH GOING THROUGH
A LOT OF CHANGES RIGHT NOW.

29:48.450 --> 29:50.543
ALL GOOD THOUGH.

29:50.650 --> 29:53.539
SO, HOW'S
THE THERAPY GOING ?

29:54.720 --> 29:56.415
UHM, GOOD.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.785
GOOD, WE'RE NOT FIGHTING SO
MUCH, I MEAN WE NEVER REALLY

29:59.890 --> 30:01.858
FOUGHT THAT MUCH, BUT...

30:01.960 --> 30:03.552
WE'RE GETTING ALONG
MUCH BETTER.

30:03.660 --> 30:05.389
NATE AND I
NEVER FIGHT.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.365
NEVER ?

30:07.470 --> 30:08.767
NO.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.259
YOU TWO HAVE
NEVER HAD A FIGHT ?

30:11.370 --> 30:14.407
NOT REALLY.

30:14.510 --> 30:17.638
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

30:19.850 --> 30:22.410
I GUESS WE JUST
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.318
MMM-HMM.

30:25.420 --> 30:30.187
EVEN SO, I WOULD THINK HAVING
A BABY ADDS SO MUCH STRESS.

30:30.290 --> 30:34.454
ACTUALLY, HAVING A BABY HELPS
PUT EVERYTHING IN PERSPECTIVE.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.494
YOU'LL SEE
WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.420
IF WE HAVE KIDS.

30:38.530 --> 30:40.794
KNOCK, KNOCK !

30:40.900 --> 30:42.868
OH LOOK, A PARTY.

30:42.970 --> 30:46.235
HELLO, I'M CAROL,
LISA'S BOSS.

30:46.340 --> 30:47.500
KEITH.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.237
I'M DAVID FISHER.

30:49.340 --> 30:50.705
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

30:50.810 --> 30:52.141
WELL, YOU'RE
BACK EARLY.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.218
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.378
NOTHING.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.812
I MEAN, LIKE FRESH AIR
IS SUCH A BIG DEAL.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.844
AT LEAST NO ONE PARKS
IN MY DRIVEWAY THERE.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.313
OH, SHOULD WE MOVE ?

31:02.420 --> 31:05.355
LISA, I WOULD LOVE SOME CINNAMON
TOAST AND A CUP OF TEA.

31:05.460 --> 31:08.020
COULD YOU WAIT
JUST A LITTLE BIT ?

31:08.130 --> 31:09.927
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
THE DAY I'VE HAD.

31:10.030 --> 31:12.669
WHO IS MY MOST
BITTER ENEMY,

31:12.770 --> 31:14.863
THE ONE PERSON I HATE
MOST IN THE WORLD ?

31:14.970 --> 31:17.689
WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE
GET-TOGETHER--

31:17.800 --> 31:19.233
EHH, MELISSA GILBERT !

31:19.340 --> 31:22.070
AND WHO OPENS THE DOOR
AT MARK AND PAM'S HOUSE ?

31:22.180 --> 31:24.239
THAT'S RIGHT,
MELISSA GILBERT.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.274
IT WAS LIKE
STARING AT EVIL ITSELF.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.610
CAROL, YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.085
HONEY, I HEARD YOU.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.384
YOU'RE HAVING
A PARTY.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.050
THEY'VE HAD YOU ALL DAY,
I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.458
BRING MY TOAST UP
TO MY BATH

31:37.560 --> 31:40.120
AND I'LL TELL YOU
HOW I MADE MELISSA CRY.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.291
GO AHEAD,
WE'RE FINE.

31:50.140 --> 31:52.358
MAN, CAN YOU
BELIEVE LISA ?

31:52.470 --> 31:53.971
I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE
WHOSE SELF-PERCEPTION

31:54.080 --> 31:55.809
IS SO FAR REMOVED
FROM REALITY.

31:55.910 --> 31:59.402
KEITH, WHAT WERE YOU
TALKING ABOUT IN THERE ?

31:59.510 --> 32:01.171
"IF" WE HAVE KIDS ?

32:01.280 --> 32:03.714
JUST WHAT I SAID,
"IF" WE HAVE KIDS.

32:03.820 --> 32:06.584
I THOUGHT WE DECIDED A LONG
TIME AGO THAT WE'D HAVE KIDS.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.055
WHEN DID
THIS CHANGE ?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.718
WHO ARE YOU
KIDDING ?

32:09.820 --> 32:12.755
WE'RE IN THERAPY NOW TO SEE IF
WE CAN EVEN EXIST AS A COUPLE.

32:12.860 --> 32:15.158
EVERYTHING ABOUT US
IS "IF".

32:15.260 --> 32:16.898
BUT THAT SHOULDN'T
CHANGE OUR GOALS.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.265
I'M JUST
BEING REALISTIC.

32:20.370 --> 32:22.031
I DON'T WANT TO PUT MYSELF
IN A SITUATION

32:22.140 --> 32:24.438
WHERE I END UP
TURNING INTO MY FATHER.

32:24.540 --> 32:27.429
( car alarm )

32:27.540 --> 32:30.509
I GUESS MAYBE I'M A LITTLE
MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR FUTURE

32:30.610 --> 32:32.601
THAN YOU ARE.

32:32.710 --> 32:34.109
OH, GET REAL.

32:34.220 --> 32:37.212
YOU AND I ARE LIVING DAY TO DAY
AND YOU KNOW IT.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.358
( car starting )

32:46.090 --> 32:47.990
OH GOD,
I'M FREEZING.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.954
OH GOD, THIS SUCKS.

32:50.060 --> 32:51.459
I'M DYING...

32:51.570 --> 32:52.628
IT'LL PASS.

32:52.730 --> 32:54.334
GIVE ME A KLONOPINE.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.998
YOU WANTED
TO DO THIS NATURAL.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.931
I ALREADY GAVE YOU THE KAVA-KAVA
AND THE VALERIAN ROOT--

32:58.040 --> 32:59.530
THEY'RE NOT
DOING SHIT.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.732
GIVE ME
A KLONOPINE !

33:00.840 --> 33:02.979
SHE'S IMPOSSIBLE.

33:03.080 --> 33:06.948
( howling )

33:07.050 --> 33:08.972
NOW, GIVE ME
AN AMBIEN.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.047
SARAH, REALLY.

33:10.150 --> 33:11.481
IT'LL PUT HER
TO SLEEP.

33:11.590 --> 33:14.184
ANYTHING
TO SHUT YOU UP.

33:15.690 --> 33:18.250
NOW I'M BURNING UP.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.021
A MOMENT AGO
YOU WERE FREEZING.

33:20.130 --> 33:21.825
WELL NOW,
I'M BURNING UP !

33:21.930 --> 33:23.955
NOW WHAT ?

33:24.070 --> 33:25.526
DIARRH EA !

33:25.630 --> 33:27.689
THIS IS WHAT PLAYING
WITH DRUGS WILL GET YOU.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.438
IT'S NOT PRETTY,
IS IT ?

33:29.540 --> 33:32.703
( howling )

33:42.020 --> 33:44.318
YOU GET CAROL
ALL TUCKED IN ?

33:44.420 --> 33:46.888
AI-TER EIGHT SLICES OF
CINNAMON TOAST AND A POPSICLE.

33:46.990 --> 33:50.153
( sighing )

33:50.260 --> 33:53.320
IT WAS NICE SEEING DAVID
AND KEITH TONIGHT.

33:53.430 --> 33:54.897
YEAH.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.855
I FEEL SO SORRY
FOR THEM.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.292
YEAH, HOW COME ?

34:00.400 --> 34:02.994
I MEAN, GOD, THEY'VE BEEN
TOGETHER SUCH A SHORT TIME,

34:03.100 --> 34:04.761
AND ALREADY THEY
NEED COUNSELING ?

34:04.870 --> 34:06.337
WELL, THEY'RE JUST--

34:06.440 --> 34:08.271
IF THEY HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS,
WHY EVEN STAY TOGETHER ?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.371
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE
A KID TO TAKE CARE OF.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.902
I DON'T KNOW.

34:12.010 --> 34:14.615
MAYBE THEY LOVE
EACH OTHER.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.608
OH...

34:16.720 --> 34:18.119
WHAT ?

34:18.220 --> 34:21.348
WHAT DETERGENT
DID YOU USE ?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.109
I DON'T KNOW,
WHATEVER WAS THERE.

34:23.220 --> 34:26.223
IT SMELLS
LIKE TIDE.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.355
SO, I GUESS
I USED THE TIDE.

34:28.460 --> 34:30.496
YOU HAVE
TO USE THE DREI-T.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.420
MAYA GETS A RASH
FROM ANYTHING ELSE.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.339
THOSE AREN'T MAYA'S CLOTHES,
THEY'RE OURS.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.692
YEAH, BUT I HOLD MAYA
ALL DAY LONG.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.199
SO, WHY DO
WE EVEN HAVE TIDE ?

34:38.310 --> 34:40.665
I'M SORRY I WASN'T FOLLOWING
YOU AROUND TAKING NOTES.

34:40.770 --> 34:41.930
NATE, DON'T GET MAD.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.075
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
TO USE THE DREI-T.

34:43.180 --> 34:44.841
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
I DIDN'T, NOW I DO.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.440
ARE WE OKAY HERE ?

34:46.550 --> 34:49.110
YEAH WE'RE OKAY, I JUST HAVE
TO WASH THIS ALL OVER AGAIN.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.676
NO, YOU DON'T.

34:50.780 --> 34:53.044
HERE, PUT THOSE DOWN.

34:53.150 --> 34:54.617
I'LL DO IT.

34:54.720 --> 34:58.178
THANK YOU.

35:12.870 --> 35:14.974
GOOD AFTERNOON.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.298
IS HE... ?

35:17.410 --> 35:19.344
HE'S RIGHT
IN THERE.

35:20.150 --> 35:21.777
MR. AND MRS. SHOWALTER.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.416
I'LL BE HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

35:23.520 --> 35:26.114
PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF
THERE'S ANYTHING AT ALL

35:26.220 --> 35:28.859
I CAN DO FOR YOU.

35:44.270 --> 35:45.908
IS THAT
ANOTHER SON ?

35:46.010 --> 35:48.331
I HOPE YOU
FRISKED HIM.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.704
PLEASE TRY TO SHOW
A LITTLE SENSITIVITY.

35:50.810 --> 35:54.143
HEY, I DID MY JOB.

35:54.250 --> 35:57.879
I CLEANED HIM
UP ALL NICE.

35:57.980 --> 36:01.359
SURE, I WAS TEMPTED
TO MAYBE LEAVE

36:01.460 --> 36:04.054
A HAND OR A FOOT
UN-EMBALMED

36:04.160 --> 36:07.323
SO HE COULD STINK LIKE
HE SHOULD, BUT NO,

36:07.430 --> 36:09.125
NO...

36:09.230 --> 36:10.857
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.518
THEN ACT LIKE ONE.

36:12.630 --> 36:16.191
THESE PEOPLE
LOVED THIS MAN.

36:19.070 --> 36:21.300
THEY DIDN'T KNOW
HIM AS A MURDERER,

36:21.410 --> 36:23.105
THEY KNEW HIM
AS THEIR SON,

36:23.210 --> 36:24.541
AS THEIR BROTHER.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.847
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM.

36:27.950 --> 36:30.316
THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE HIM.

36:30.420 --> 36:31.819
JESUS CHRIST,
FEDERICO !

36:31.920 --> 36:34.309
I'M REALLY GETTING SICK OF
ALL THIS MORAL SUPERIORITY.

36:34.420 --> 36:37.355
EVERYTHING IS SO GODDAMN
BLACK AND WHITE FOR YOU.

36:37.460 --> 36:41.123
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I JUST THINK--

36:41.230 --> 36:43.095
YOU CAN'T EVER
REALLY KNOW A PERSON,

36:43.200 --> 36:44.497
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN,

36:44.600 --> 36:47.421
YOU'RE LIVING
IN A FUCKING DREAM WORLD.

36:54.910 --> 36:56.605
I MADE EGG SALAD.

36:56.710 --> 37:01.147
JOLTS OF ELECTRICITY
ARE SHOOTING THROUGH MY BODY

37:01.250 --> 37:04.174
AND TEARING ME APART !

37:04.290 --> 37:06.679
THEN BETTINA
AND I WILL EAT.

37:06.790 --> 37:11.727
( heavy breathing )

37:13.930 --> 37:17.923
MAYBE I'LL
HAVE A LITTLE.

37:26.270 --> 37:31.003
SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
TAKING THE VICODIN ?

37:31.110 --> 37:33.749
I DON'T KNOW.

37:33.850 --> 37:38.913
ON AND OFF FOR YEARS.

37:39.020 --> 37:42.285
WHY ?

37:47.730 --> 37:49.755
BECAUSE...

37:49.860 --> 37:52.897
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE
I STARTED TO REALIZE

37:53.000 --> 37:58.165
I WAS NO LONGER THE YOUNGEST
OR PRETTIEST GIRL IN THE ROOM.

37:58.270 --> 38:01.137
UGH !

38:01.240 --> 38:05.347
FOR A WHILE I SATISFIED
MYSELF WITH...

38:05.450 --> 38:11.309
BEING THE MOST
INTRIGUING...

38:11.420 --> 38:13.945
BUT EVENTUALLY I JUST
BECAME THE ONE IN PAISLEY.

38:14.050 --> 38:17.213
IT'S TOO FUCKING
DEPRESSING.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.220
I'M SORRY, DEAR.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.524
BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE
MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.621
YEAH, YOU'RE
A DRUG ADDICT.

38:22.730 --> 38:26.461
I NEED TO SPICE
THIS UP A LITTLE.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.094
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
AND I'LL GET IT.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.098
NO, NO, NO.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.269
SIT DOWN.

38:30.370 --> 38:31.837
I NEED SPICES.

38:31.940 --> 38:32.907
WHERE IS IT ?

38:33.010 --> 38:34.204
IN THE KITCHEN.

38:34.310 --> 38:35.470
WHERE'S THE VICODIN ?

38:35.580 --> 38:37.332
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING--

38:37.440 --> 38:39.772
WE ALREADY FOUND YOUR STASH
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM

38:39.880 --> 38:41.006
AND IN THE BOOKCASE.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.316
WHERE ELSE,
IN THE SPICE RACK ?

38:42.420 --> 38:44.217
YOU'RE BEING
RIDICULOUS.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.309
LET ME GO !

38:45.420 --> 38:47.183
WHERE'S THE VICODIN ?

38:47.290 --> 38:48.109
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.586
WHERE, WHERE, WHERE ?!

38:50.690 --> 38:55.298
IN THE CORIANDER JAR,
YOU PIG FUCKER !

38:55.400 --> 38:59.325
YOUR LIES AREN'T
HELPING, DEAR.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.663
HERE, RUTH AND I

39:03.770 --> 39:07.001
ARE GONNA GO OUTSIDE
AND GET SOME AIR.

39:07.110 --> 39:09.431
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

39:09.540 --> 39:12.145
YOU DON'T THINK I'M JUST
GOING TO LEAVE YOU ?

39:12.250 --> 39:14.047
YOU CAN'T
TIE ME UP !

39:14.150 --> 39:17.813
IT'S FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.444
( sobbing )

39:19.550 --> 39:22.348
DO YOU WANT ME
TO BREAK THIS ARM ?!

39:22.460 --> 39:24.655
BECAUSE I WILL !

39:30.700 --> 39:34.466
YEAH, THAT SHOULD HOLD.

39:38.410 --> 39:42.676
I HOPE THE COYOTES
EAT YOU !

39:42.780 --> 39:45.840
SO DO I.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.557
( sighing )

39:56.660 --> 39:58.457
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU REMAIN SO CALM.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.721
I TOOK A VICODIN.

40:00.830 --> 40:02.525
NOT REALLY ?

40:02.630 --> 40:06.066
YEAH, I FIGURED IF THERE
WAS EVER A TIME...

40:06.170 --> 40:08.934
YOU WANT ONE ?

40:09.040 --> 40:10.632
OH, NO,
THANK YOU.

40:10.740 --> 40:14.369
I'LL KILL YOU BOTH,
I SWEAR I WILL !

40:14.480 --> 40:17.233
WELL, MAYBE HALF.

40:17.340 --> 40:21.515
(yelling )

40:23.080 --> 40:26.811
HELP !

40:33.830 --> 40:36.151
I THINK THERE'S
SOME MEAT LOAF IN HERE.

40:36.260 --> 40:38.660
YEAH, OKAY.

40:40.930 --> 40:42.090
HEY.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.269
HI.

40:43.370 --> 40:45.429
YOU'RE...

40:45.540 --> 40:47.531
PHIL, RIGHT,
THE CREMATORY GUY.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.335
YEAH, HEY, NATE.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.908
WHAT ?

40:52.010 --> 40:53.705
NOTHING.

40:57.480 --> 40:58.845
MOM CALLED.

40:58.950 --> 41:00.747
SHE'S SPENDING ANOTHER
NIGHT AT AUNT SARAH'S.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.181
COOL.

41:02.290 --> 41:04.212
WE CAN JUST
STAY HERE THEN.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.958
SURE.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.620
ALSO THERE'S A COUPLE
DEATH CERTIFICATES

41:08.730 --> 41:10.049
YOU CAN PICK UP
TOMORROW.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.593
WHERE ?

41:11.700 --> 41:13.065
ONE'S AT
A NURSING HOME.

41:13.170 --> 41:14.637
AND THE OTHER,
I THINK...

41:14.740 --> 41:17.129
IS ALSO AT
A NURSING HOME.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.936
UGH, I HATE
THOSE PLACES.

41:20.040 --> 41:23.203
ALL THE OLD PEOPLE
WANT TO TOUCH MY HAIR.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.816
with people.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.127
Okay, and he
likes people.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.754
And they like him.

41:40.860 --> 41:42.350
So, he said,
don't worry, mom,

41:42.460 --> 41:43.859
I'm going to be
just fine.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.496
( phone )

41:45.600 --> 41:47.625
HEY, LIS...

41:47.730 --> 41:50.631
NO, I'LL PROBABLY JUST
GRAB A SANDWICH HERE.

41:50.740 --> 41:55.370
UH, I'LL PROBABLY BE LEAVING
IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO,

41:55.480 --> 41:57.232
I STILL GOT A BUNCH
OF SHIT TO DO.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.841
I LOVE YOU TOO.

41:58.950 --> 42:02.147
GIVE MAYA
A KISS FOR ME, BYE.

42:04.050 --> 42:07.508
Well, considering
getting him a girlfriend.

42:07.620 --> 42:11.829
And he's had a number
of girlfriends.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.886
SO, NATE'S THE ONE
WHO JUST GOT MARRIED ?

42:13.990 --> 42:15.218
YEAH.

42:15.330 --> 42:16.649
YOU LIKE HIS WIFE ?

42:16.760 --> 42:19.763
I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HER THAT WELL.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.690
BUT I MEAN,
I LIKE HER.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.939
YOU SHOULD'VE MET
HIS LAST GIRLFRIEND.

42:24.040 --> 42:28.500
SHE WAS "CHARLOTTE,
LIGHT AND DARK".

42:28.610 --> 42:30.009
NOT FOR REAL ?

42:30.110 --> 42:31.407
THE BARKING GIRL ?

42:31.510 --> 42:33.205
FOR REAL.

42:33.310 --> 42:34.470
WOW.

42:34.580 --> 42:36.468
( laughing )

42:36.580 --> 42:38.946
YOU WANT ANOTHER ?

42:39.050 --> 42:42.656
NO, I'M GOOD.

42:42.760 --> 42:48.289
SO, WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE NEXT FRIDAY OR SATURDAY.

42:52.970 --> 42:55.131
DO YOU HAVE
A REALLY BUSY WEEK ?

42:55.240 --> 42:58.164
UHM, I DON'T KNOW.

42:58.270 --> 43:02.172
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY
"NEXT FRIDAY OR SATURDAY,"

43:02.280 --> 43:06.239
THAT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE "NOT
UNTIL NEXT FRIDAY OR SATURDAY."

43:10.580 --> 43:13.481
HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
THE TWO OF US ARE,

43:13.590 --> 43:15.387
WELL, YOU KNOW,

43:15.490 --> 43:16.957
EXCLUSIVE ?

43:17.060 --> 43:21.622
'CAUSE I NEVER REALLY MEANT
TO GIVE THAT IMPRESSION.

43:22.860 --> 43:24.919
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

43:25.030 --> 43:29.364
WELL, THAT SOMETIMES
I SEE OTHER WOMEN.

43:32.640 --> 43:35.279
AND BY "SEE"
YOU MEAN "FUCK".

43:35.380 --> 43:38.804
HOWEVER YOU WANT
TO PUT IT.

43:43.280 --> 43:46.010
YEAH, I MEAN,
I FIGURED.

43:46.120 --> 43:50.557
UNTIL YOU REALLY GET
TO KNOW SOMEONE, I JUST...

43:50.660 --> 43:53.151
IT SEEMS
THE WAY TO GO.

43:53.260 --> 43:56.388
YEAH, OF COURSE.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.991
YOU SEE OTHER GUYS,
DON'T YOU ?

43:59.100 --> 44:01.022
YOU'RE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT RUSSELL.

44:01.130 --> 44:02.859
RUSSELL'S GAY.

44:02.970 --> 44:06.758
OH.

44:06.870 --> 44:10.601
BUT I GUESS IF I WAS
TO MEET SOMEONE...

44:10.710 --> 44:12.348
NOT THAT I'M LOOKING
TO FUCK AROUND.

44:12.450 --> 44:13.803
BUT...

44:13.910 --> 44:16.242
I GUESS IF I LIKED
SOMEONE, WHATEVER...

44:16.350 --> 44:19.387
COOL.

44:34.170 --> 44:36.058
ARE YOU MAD ?

44:43.310 --> 44:45.449
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO ?

44:47.550 --> 44:49.973
NO.

44:51.550 --> 44:56.453
( tv chatter )

45:03.100 --> 45:07.423
DO YOU WANT TO GO UP
TO YOUR ROOM ?

45:07.530 --> 45:08.963
YEAH.

45:09.070 --> 45:10.765
LET'S GO.

45:13.070 --> 45:15.868
( laughing )

45:20.050 --> 45:23.349
( male on tv)
Back in Texas, we call
ice cream frozen cow juice.

45:23.450 --> 45:26.988
Hi-yaa !

45:27.090 --> 45:28.409
Thank you.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.351
( other male )
No, no, thank you.

45:30.460 --> 45:32.485
Hi-yaa !

45:32.590 --> 45:34.080
BABY, I'M WARNING YOU:

45:34.190 --> 45:36.988
I'M IN A BAD MOOD,
I HAD A VERY BAD DAY.

45:37.100 --> 45:39.694
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT
ONE OF MY FAVORITE DOCTORS

45:39.800 --> 45:41.665
WAS ARRESTED FOR
SELLING STEROIDS.

45:41.770 --> 45:43.362
OH, AND NOW THERE'S
A RUMOR FLYING AROUND

45:43.470 --> 45:45.233
THAT AMERIMED'S GOING
TO CLOSE THE HOSPITAL.

45:45.340 --> 45:46.568
THAT'S GREAT.

45:46.670 --> 45:48.035
THERE'S K-F-C
IN THE MICROWAVE.

45:48.140 --> 45:51.769
I'M SORRY, I JUST HAD
TO GET YOU OUT

45:51.880 --> 45:53.507
FROM UNDER MY FEET
FOR A WHILE.

45:53.610 --> 45:56.215
but I brought
my karate gear.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.412
Hi-yaa !

45:57.520 --> 46:00.239
JULIO, COULD YOU PLEASE
TURN THAT DAMN THING DOWN ?

46:00.350 --> 46:02.580
Hi-yaa !

46:02.690 --> 46:04.658
Hi-yaa, hi-yaa !

46:04.760 --> 46:07.854
Sandy won't
beat me this time

46:07.960 --> 46:09.894
because I've got
the elements on my side.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.468
The elements
of surprise.

46:12.570 --> 46:14.993
Hi-yaa !

46:26.550 --> 46:29.644
I may be down,
but I'm not out.

46:29.750 --> 46:32.014
Way to go, buddy.

46:32.120 --> 46:35.510
It took us three days
to make that potato salad.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.329
( sighing )

46:40.430 --> 46:42.398
ARE YOU GOING
TO THE STORE TOMORROW ?

46:42.500 --> 46:44.252
I WASN'T
PLANNING ON IT.

46:44.360 --> 46:45.497
WHAT DO YOU NEED ?

46:45.600 --> 46:47.397
BABY WIPES.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.661
AND BABY FOOD, BUT YOU HAVE
TO GO TO WHOLE FOODS FOR THAT.

46:49.770 --> 46:51.294
ALRIGHT.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.765
BUT IF YOU GO TO RITE-AID
YOU CAN GET HER A NEW SIPPY CUP

46:52.870 --> 46:54.337
AND I LOST
HER NAIL CLIPPERS.

46:54.440 --> 46:55.873
MAKE SURE YOU GET THEM
IN THE BABY SECTION,

46:55.980 --> 46:57.504
THE OTHERS
ARE TOO BIG.

46:57.610 --> 47:01.376
UHM, TOILET PAPER, LIGHT BULBS,
THE ENERGY EFFICIENT ONES.

47:01.480 --> 47:05.189
AND FACIAL SCRUB FOR ME,
YOU KNOW, THE PEACH KIND.

47:05.290 --> 47:08.043
ALRIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN.

47:08.150 --> 47:11.187
IT'S ON THE
REFRIGERATOR.

47:11.290 --> 47:12.723
ALRIGHT.

47:12.830 --> 47:16.254
I'LL TRY TO DO IT
ON THE WAY HOME FROM WORK.

47:16.360 --> 47:19.022
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY
OR YOU'LL DO IT ?

47:19.130 --> 47:22.691
ONLY BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T,
THEN I'LL DO IT.

47:22.800 --> 47:24.495
I'LL DO IT.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.568
THANK YOU.

47:26.670 --> 47:29.901
YOU'RE WELCOME.

47:33.050 --> 47:36.247
I HAD TO MAKE CARROT SOUP
FOR CAROL'S STYLIST TODAY

47:36.350 --> 47:38.215
AND DRIVE IT OUT
TO HER IN CULVER CITY.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.447
YOU KNOW THAT WOMAN
HAS BEEN SENT TO EARTH

47:40.550 --> 47:42.518
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF
TORTURING YOU, RIGHT ?

47:42.620 --> 47:43.882
GOD, IT'S TRUE !

47:43.990 --> 47:45.855
I DON'T EVEN WORK FOR HER
AND SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.656
SHE WANTS ME TO MAKE HER
RICE PUDDING TOMORROW.

47:48.760 --> 47:50.455
I THINK I'LL USE
WHOLE MILK.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.164
IT GIVES HER
DIARRH EA.

47:52.270 --> 47:53.794
( laughing )

47:53.900 --> 47:56.733
WE COULD CALL
ALL OUR FRIENDS

47:56.840 --> 47:58.865
AND HAVE THEM PARK
IN HER DRIVEWAY.

47:58.970 --> 48:02.474
WE COULD TAKE PICTURES
OF HER SWIMMING NAKED

48:02.580 --> 48:04.502
AND POST THEM
ON THE INTERNET.

48:04.610 --> 48:06.043
OH MY GOD,
I SAW HER ONCE.

48:06.150 --> 48:08.368
SHE HAS THE BIGGEST BUSH
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

48:08.480 --> 48:10.948
SHE REALLY DOES...

48:20.530 --> 48:23.454
IF I TOLD YOU SOMETHING, WOULD
YOU PROMISE NOT TO LAUGH ?

48:23.560 --> 48:25.323
NO.

48:25.430 --> 48:30.436
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER BEEN IN A HAMMOCK.

48:30.540 --> 48:33.930
THEY ALWAYS
SCARED ME.

48:34.040 --> 48:35.678
( laughing )

48:35.780 --> 48:39.409
I ALWAYS SAW THEM
IN CARTOONS

48:39.510 --> 48:42.911
AND THE PEOPLE WOULD GET IN THEM
AND THEY'D SPIN AROUND SO FAST

48:43.020 --> 48:44.942
AND THE PEOPLE
WOULD GO FLYING !

48:45.050 --> 48:48.747
WELL, DON'T WORRY,
YOU'RE SAFE.

48:48.850 --> 48:53.480
(yelling )

48:58.860 --> 49:03.331
(yelling )

49:06.110 --> 49:10.934
IT'S SO PEACEFUL
OUT HERE.

49:13.510 --> 49:17.378
(yelling )

49:20.120 --> 49:22.452
YOU WANT SOME
MORE WINE ?

49:22.560 --> 49:25.222
SURE, WHY NOT ?

49:25.330 --> 49:28.629
TAKE A SLUG RIGHT
OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

49:28.730 --> 49:30.459
REALLY ?

49:30.560 --> 49:31.788
GO ON.

49:31.900 --> 49:35.267
I FEEL LIKE
AN OLD HOBO.

49:35.370 --> 49:39.136
MAYBE WE SHOULD HOP
A FREIGHT TRAIN.

49:39.240 --> 49:42.835
WE COULD HEAD UP
TO FRISCO.

49:42.940 --> 49:46.068
PICK US UP
A COUPLA SAILORS.

49:46.180 --> 49:49.570
WE'RE SO BAD !

49:49.680 --> 49:51.875
( laughing )

49:51.980 --> 49:54.119
YES, WE ARE...
