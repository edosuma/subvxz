WEBVTT

00:35.045 --> 00:35.925
[cat meows]

00:38.285 --> 00:39.925
First day nerves kicking in yet?

00:40.525 --> 00:43.205
Nah, it's like coming back
after the summer holidays.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.245
If the holidays lasted 30 years
and were spent as a stone statue.

00:50.045 --> 00:52.085
I wish Joy could have seen me like this.

00:52.805 --> 00:53.965
In all the gear...

00:54.925 --> 00:56.725
and officially enrolled at Cackle's.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.365
It was her dream.

00:59.365 --> 01:01.205
Well, now it's come true.

01:02.365 --> 01:03.245
Not quite.

01:05.005 --> 01:06.885
Not until I pass that Witching exam.

01:07.805 --> 01:08.805
Which I will.

01:11.485 --> 01:12.485
[chuckles]

01:13.445 --> 01:14.485
[pupils chatter]

01:15.125 --> 01:16.725
[Indigo] I got given magic,

01:16.805 --> 01:18.405
then I had too much fun,

01:19.085 --> 01:20.925
then I got turned to stone

01:21.005 --> 01:23.405
and stayed like that for about 30 years.

01:23.485 --> 01:26.325
So you and Mildred aren't cousins?

01:26.405 --> 01:29.005
Well. We're close like cousins.

01:29.685 --> 01:30.725
But biologically?

01:31.845 --> 01:32.885
[Ethel] Legally?

01:32.965 --> 01:36.205
[quietly] Indigo Moon proved that
she did not belong here 30 years ago.

01:36.925 --> 01:39.125
If she were to learn who I am... Ada?

01:40.045 --> 01:42.685
I understand your concern, Hecate,

01:42.765 --> 01:45.445
but Mildred did swear to keep your secret,

01:45.525 --> 01:48.765
and Indigo must be given
a fair chance to succeed here.

01:50.085 --> 01:52.565
I assure you, trouble will find that girl.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.205
It always did.

01:55.085 --> 01:56.925
[Miss Tapioca]
Stop playing with your food, new girl.

01:57.645 --> 01:59.485
But is it meant to stand up like that?

02:05.565 --> 02:06.885
Maybe I can fix it.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.885
Oats and milk, a touch of honey.

02:10.445 --> 02:11.725
Time to make this porridge runny!

02:14.005 --> 02:15.365
[pupils gasp]

02:16.405 --> 02:18.285
-Maybe that's a bit too runny.
-[Mildred sighs]

02:18.925 --> 02:20.685
Indigo Moon!

02:24.925 --> 02:26.365
[Miss Drill] Pens down please, girls.

02:26.445 --> 02:28.285
Hand your paper to your neighbor to mark.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.205
Did you finish?

02:32.725 --> 02:35.005
[Enid] I didn't. I'm so going to fail.

02:36.045 --> 02:38.765
I'm barely scraping a D-average as it is.

02:42.885 --> 02:46.285
See that paper, all that white.
Finish the test, now make it right.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.645
Thought I could use magic
to finish it off for you.

02:53.965 --> 02:54.885
I was just trying to help.

02:55.525 --> 02:59.445
I'm going to face a summer locked away
with a tutor if my grades don't pick up.

02:59.885 --> 03:00.725
Please...

03:01.365 --> 03:02.365
don't help me.

03:03.045 --> 03:05.085
Indigo Moon.

03:16.005 --> 03:17.485
I know you're doing your best.

03:18.245 --> 03:19.565
You'll get it right in the end.

03:20.365 --> 03:21.645
Why are you helping me?

03:22.485 --> 03:23.725
You don't owe me anything.

03:24.885 --> 03:27.605
Like saving me from being a statue
wasn't enough?

03:27.685 --> 03:29.845
I feel kind of responsible now.

03:31.045 --> 03:31.885
Mil...

03:33.685 --> 03:34.685
about Joy.

03:36.325 --> 03:38.125
I know she'd be a lot older now,

03:38.925 --> 03:40.125
but... [breathes deeply]

03:42.245 --> 03:44.045
I really do miss her.

03:45.485 --> 03:47.725
Do you have any idea where she is?

03:54.285 --> 03:55.485
Sorry, Indie.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.685
Well, she's better off somewhere else.

04:00.205 --> 04:02.645
She'd hate HB just as much as I do.

04:03.485 --> 04:04.325
[sighs]

04:05.965 --> 04:07.125
[Star pants]

04:10.165 --> 04:11.405
[school bell clangs]

04:13.285 --> 04:14.605
[pupils chatter]

04:20.405 --> 04:21.445
I'll follow you.

04:27.965 --> 04:28.805
Miss Hardbroom.

04:29.565 --> 04:31.445
I know Indie's a bit of a...

04:32.285 --> 04:33.645
handful at the moment.

04:34.285 --> 04:37.325
But perhaps she'd be less bother
if she knew

04:37.925 --> 04:39.645
who you really are?

04:40.205 --> 04:45.245
Indigo Moon is the living embodiment
of a terrible mistake I made.

04:51.005 --> 04:53.925
Thirty years have passed,
life has moved on.

04:54.005 --> 04:57.005
I do not want a heart-warming reunion,

04:57.085 --> 04:59.405
I want rid of her.

05:02.605 --> 05:03.805
What was all that about?

05:04.805 --> 05:05.725
I made a deal.

05:06.725 --> 05:09.285
[Mildred] If Indie doesn't pass
the Magical Proficiency exam,

05:09.365 --> 05:11.645
then Miss Cackle will throw us both out.

05:11.725 --> 05:13.805
[Maud] What? That's so unfair!
How would it be your fault?

05:14.845 --> 05:16.365
Why would you agree to that, Mil?

05:16.765 --> 05:18.285
[Mildred] It was the only way
Indie could stay.

05:18.365 --> 05:20.085
And I wanted to prove it could work out.

05:20.525 --> 05:21.405
[Maud sighs]

05:24.445 --> 05:26.365
[Miss Hardbroom] Get on with it, girls.

05:26.765 --> 05:27.805
[potions bubble]

05:29.165 --> 05:30.445
What spell is this again?

05:31.165 --> 05:33.405
Levitation. For the fiftieth time.

05:33.845 --> 05:35.525
Maybe if you paid attention.

05:37.925 --> 05:38.765
Okay.

05:38.845 --> 05:40.125
How's this for attention?

05:41.565 --> 05:44.485
Tooth of fox and claw of bear,

05:44.565 --> 05:46.525
cauldron stay up in the air!

05:46.605 --> 05:47.445
[scraping]

05:47.525 --> 05:48.445
[pupils gasp]

05:50.845 --> 05:52.365
-[table clatters]
-[pupils gasp]

05:53.365 --> 05:55.365
Indigo Moon!

05:56.005 --> 05:58.285
Keep this up
and you will be gone from here

05:58.365 --> 06:02.085
before you even get near
that Witching examination.

06:02.165 --> 06:04.645
And so will Mildred. Happy days.

06:06.605 --> 06:08.845
Clean up that mess. Now!

06:10.085 --> 06:13.565
Great. All of my hard work ruined.

06:13.645 --> 06:14.645
Again.

06:15.725 --> 06:18.005
Do you have to be such a nightmare?

06:18.085 --> 06:19.965
Come on Enid. She's still learning.

06:20.045 --> 06:22.045
Why are you defending her?

06:22.125 --> 06:24.765
Ever since she got here,
it feels like you've put her first.

06:24.845 --> 06:27.125
Maybe I just haven't forgotten
what it means to be a good friend?

06:27.205 --> 06:28.725
Or maybe you don't want to be mine?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.005
She needs time, Enid, that's all.

06:31.085 --> 06:34.485
She's trouble, Maud,
and she'll get us all in trouble too.

06:34.565 --> 06:36.165
You do realize I'm right here?

06:37.085 --> 06:37.925
I know.

06:38.645 --> 06:39.605
That's the problem.

06:40.685 --> 06:41.525
[door opens]

06:41.605 --> 06:44.965
Miss Hardbroom! Everyone!
Come outside, quickly!

06:46.205 --> 06:47.645
[pupils chatter]

06:49.245 --> 06:50.965
[brooms whoosh]

06:53.045 --> 06:54.405
[excited chatter]

07:04.245 --> 07:07.645
[applause and cheering]

07:22.965 --> 07:24.765
[applause and cheering]

07:24.845 --> 07:25.765
Mum!

07:28.485 --> 07:29.805
Why didn't you say you were coming?

07:29.885 --> 07:33.045
You know that's not how surprises work,
right? Daddy sends his love.

07:33.845 --> 07:36.005
Miss Cackle said I could come and do
some promo shots here

07:36.085 --> 07:38.965
for my new magic talent show, if I just
did an interview for the school paper.

07:39.045 --> 07:39.885
Cool!

07:39.965 --> 07:42.445
It's funny, isn't it?
It's like I've come full circle.

07:42.525 --> 07:45.205
Doesn't seem five minutes
since I was the nervous kid

07:45.285 --> 07:46.965
who somehow won my first contest.

07:47.045 --> 07:48.285
And now you're a judge.

07:48.365 --> 07:50.485
[Narcissus] Exactly! Anyway,

07:50.565 --> 07:52.525
I thought it was a great excuse
to see my little girl.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.165
Check up on me, you mean?

07:54.245 --> 07:56.565
We'll catch up afterwards,
just you and me. How's that sound?

07:57.405 --> 08:00.685
Like I should get in trouble more often
so that I can see you.

08:03.285 --> 08:06.085
[Narcissus] Well met.
And thank you for this, Miss Cackle.

08:06.165 --> 08:10.885
Oh, well met, Mistress Nightshade,
it's our pleasure, I assure you.

08:10.965 --> 08:14.885
Yes, thank you for turning our school
into a... circus.

08:14.965 --> 08:18.445
[Miss Cackle] Now, our chief reporter
Felicity will conduct the interview.

08:20.085 --> 08:20.965
It's an honor!

08:21.765 --> 08:22.605
Creep.

08:22.685 --> 08:24.485
[Miss Cackle] I wonder
if you need a few helpers?

08:24.565 --> 08:25.965
I'm sure I'll be fine, Miss Cackle.

08:26.045 --> 08:28.805
-Us! We'll do it!
-Can we do it? Please!

08:28.885 --> 08:31.005
-[girls] Please can we do it!
-Of course.

08:31.085 --> 08:32.165
[excited squealing]

08:32.245 --> 08:33.405
[chuckles]

08:35.165 --> 08:37.205
Look how everyone adores her.

08:37.285 --> 08:38.765
[quiet excited chatter]

08:44.845 --> 08:47.684
We're with<i> the</i> Narcissus Nightshade.

08:47.965 --> 08:49.645
[Beatrice] On a glamorous photo shoot.

08:49.725 --> 08:51.605
Seriously, pinch me now.

08:52.325 --> 08:53.285
Ow!

08:53.365 --> 08:55.405
Such a cute outfit. Who made it?

08:55.485 --> 08:57.445
[Clarice] Talk about soft-ball questions.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.885
Are you this glamorous on your day off?

08:59.965 --> 09:02.125
Or are you more slippers and sweatpants?

09:02.525 --> 09:03.845
Go join your friends, Enid.

09:03.925 --> 09:06.085
I'll come and find you after, I promise.

09:06.965 --> 09:08.005
[shutter clicks]

09:09.445 --> 09:10.445
Okay.

09:10.525 --> 09:13.205
[Miss Drill in distance] That's it.
Well done. And shake it out.

09:16.205 --> 09:17.805
[Miss Drill] That's it, girls!

09:17.885 --> 09:18.885
Knees up!

09:20.365 --> 09:21.405
Higher!

09:22.765 --> 09:25.405
So Enid's mum got super-famous
off some talent show?

09:25.885 --> 09:28.605
Well, she was touring for years
with her parents before that.

09:28.685 --> 09:31.805
She still works really hard though.
Enid barely sees her.

09:31.885 --> 09:32.725
Worth it though.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.125
[wind blows]

09:41.165 --> 09:42.205
[thunder]

09:47.725 --> 09:48.805
[applause, cheering]

09:49.965 --> 09:51.205
Woo! Go Mum!

09:52.205 --> 09:54.405
[Indigo] See? There's nothing like
the buzz of an audience.

09:54.965 --> 09:57.005
I loved doing magic tricks
for the kids in the park.

09:57.085 --> 10:01.525
Yes, yes, very good, but can she do
a triple backflip forward roll star-jump?

10:02.365 --> 10:03.325
I don't think so.

10:04.525 --> 10:06.165
Let's change up the look, shall we?

10:12.205 --> 10:13.765
I used to do tricks like that.

10:14.885 --> 10:19.565
Oh yeah, Narcissus Nightshade,
the biggest star in the witchy world

10:19.645 --> 10:22.605
and you... 30 years a garden gnome.

10:22.685 --> 10:24.365
You're like twins.

10:27.725 --> 10:29.325
Miss Drill, my lace has broken.
Can I get a spare?

10:30.005 --> 10:32.405
Not having very much luck
on your first day, are you, Indigo?

10:45.805 --> 10:46.965
[stone splashes into water]

10:47.045 --> 10:48.365
[Narcissus] Something's come up.

10:49.205 --> 10:50.765
It's a VIP birthday party.

10:52.205 --> 10:53.765
It's a big opportunity.

10:54.525 --> 10:56.205
I have to go, Enid, I'm sorry.

10:57.085 --> 10:58.165
Take me with you.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.325
Why can't I go on tour, like you did
with your mum and dad?

11:01.405 --> 11:03.125
No. School's too important.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.805
All your friends are here.

11:04.885 --> 11:06.805
But I never get to see you.

11:07.485 --> 11:09.085
First Spellbound, now this.

11:09.165 --> 11:11.125
I won't apologize for working hard.

11:11.205 --> 11:15.005
How else do you think we can afford
our lovely home, all the fancy holidays?

11:15.085 --> 11:16.525
Stop making excuses.

11:16.605 --> 11:18.125
You just want me out the way.

11:18.725 --> 11:20.525
I can't talk to you when you're like this.

11:22.645 --> 11:23.845
[stone splashes into water]

11:25.485 --> 11:28.405
Here's a spell with magic rhyme,
take this person back in time,

11:28.485 --> 11:30.125
Mistress Nightshade is her name,

11:30.205 --> 11:31.845
take her back before her fame!

11:33.405 --> 11:34.925
[magical twinkling]

11:37.965 --> 11:38.805
Hi!

11:40.045 --> 11:42.405
[Enid] Um... I'm Enid.

11:42.485 --> 11:44.125
And you are?

11:44.205 --> 11:47.205
Narcissus Nightshade. Well met.

11:48.005 --> 11:50.205
[to herself] I didn't mean
to turn her into a child.

11:53.205 --> 11:55.445
Um... I'm sorry,

11:56.045 --> 11:59.445
there's been a slight... magical mix-up.

11:59.525 --> 12:02.365
Then undo it!
I've got a rehearsal in an hour.

12:05.885 --> 12:07.525
Quick! They can't see us!

12:09.445 --> 12:10.685
[bell rings]

12:12.685 --> 12:14.165
Her broom's not in the shed.

12:14.245 --> 12:15.325
Her bag's gone too.

12:16.325 --> 12:17.765
I think she's run away, Maud.

12:19.645 --> 12:21.525
It's okay, boy, it's okay.

12:21.605 --> 12:23.645
-We'll find her.
-[Star pants]

12:24.245 --> 12:26.445
If she doesn't sit the exam,
that's an instant fail,

12:26.525 --> 12:27.805
and we're both out of Cackles.

12:27.885 --> 12:29.725
Okay, so where might she go?

12:29.805 --> 12:31.165
I don't know.

12:32.365 --> 12:33.565
[Mildred] Back to the park?

12:33.645 --> 12:34.805
[Star pants]

12:39.605 --> 12:41.645
[Mildred] It's the last thing
she was looking at.

12:42.485 --> 12:44.485
The TV talent show?
She wouldn't enter that, would she?

12:44.565 --> 12:46.245
Well, we were talking about them before

12:46.325 --> 12:49.165
and she said she really misses performing,
so, maybe?

12:50.525 --> 12:52.205
Look, the auditions start today.

12:53.165 --> 12:55.205
At some big TV studio.

12:55.285 --> 12:58.965
But it's in the non-magical world.
She can't expose true magic on TV!

12:59.525 --> 13:01.725
If true magic is revealed
to non-magical people,

13:01.805 --> 13:03.925
the line between our two worlds
would dissolve,

13:04.005 --> 13:07.245
and everything, our entire magical
existence, Mil, would be destroyed.

13:07.925 --> 13:09.325
It says so in the Witches Code.

13:09.405 --> 13:11.805
Well, then we have to find her
and bring her back here fast.

13:11.885 --> 13:13.325
Before HB finds out.

13:15.405 --> 13:16.645
[Star whines]

13:17.885 --> 13:21.125
We'll get in so much trouble for this
if we get caught. And what about Enid?

13:21.205 --> 13:23.805
After today,
I think it's probably just us.

13:23.885 --> 13:24.885
You ready?

13:25.565 --> 13:27.645
Nope, me neither. Let's go!

13:29.565 --> 13:31.005
Now, this is interesting.

13:33.525 --> 13:36.565
[whooshing]

13:40.365 --> 13:42.005
[magical twinkling]

13:44.325 --> 13:46.125
So much noisier than Cackle's.

13:46.205 --> 13:47.765
And why's everyone in such a rush?

13:47.845 --> 13:49.205
Can you see a TV studio?

13:50.205 --> 13:52.445
We might have to become
visible to ask directions.

13:52.525 --> 13:54.165
That's against the Witches Code.

13:57.205 --> 13:59.325
We're breaking the rules
just being here, Maud.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.485
What's one more?

14:00.565 --> 14:03.245
Okay, but we can't let anyone
see us using magic.

14:07.445 --> 14:11.205
Spell be lifted, now reveal,
lower my protective shield!

14:13.525 --> 14:14.765
[Maud] Has it worked?

14:16.205 --> 14:18.365
Hi! How are you doing?

14:19.365 --> 14:20.445
[Mildred] Yes, Maud, it worked.

14:20.525 --> 14:21.525
Now, run!

14:25.165 --> 14:29.245
Going around with your mum and dad,
together all the time,

14:29.325 --> 14:31.045
performing shows...

14:31.125 --> 14:33.645
[sighs] That sounds amazing.

14:33.725 --> 14:35.885
At first. Mainly it's just tough.

14:36.445 --> 14:38.205
And there's nowhere to escape to.

14:38.285 --> 14:39.965
What about school?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.045
I don't go to school.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.245
What about friends?

14:43.325 --> 14:45.245
-I don't have any.
-What?

14:45.325 --> 14:47.125
But everyone has someone?

14:48.365 --> 14:49.405
Does a tutor count?

14:50.405 --> 14:51.845
Not really.

14:52.565 --> 14:56.165
We're on first name terms.
Her name's Doris.

14:56.245 --> 14:59.085
That sounds... a bit lonely.

14:59.485 --> 15:00.685
Sometimes.

15:02.805 --> 15:04.685
Where are your loser friends, Enid?

15:05.365 --> 15:07.885
[Ethel] If they've left the school,
they're in a lot of trouble.

15:09.845 --> 15:10.845
And you are?

15:10.925 --> 15:13.565
[Enid] Uh, well...

15:13.645 --> 15:14.965
this is...

15:15.605 --> 15:16.885
my friend.

15:18.045 --> 15:21.805
[Enid] You know what?
I saw Mildred and Maud, heading that way.

15:23.365 --> 15:24.765
Right, Doris?

15:26.445 --> 15:28.525
That's right. Follow us.

15:29.525 --> 15:32.205
Enid! Where's your mum?
I need to finish my interview!

15:38.605 --> 15:41.725
This is the place in the advert.
She must be here somewhere.

15:44.085 --> 15:45.565
What?

15:45.645 --> 15:47.125
She's using real magic!

15:47.765 --> 15:49.445
Is that the talent show? Is this on TV?

15:49.525 --> 15:52.285
It doesn't look like a proper live show.
Is it a rehearsal?

15:52.365 --> 15:54.245
The studio must be really clo...

15:54.325 --> 15:55.165
There!

15:55.925 --> 15:57.485
[Mildred] That's where
the audience goes in.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.925
They put it up on the screen so everyone
can see what's happening inside.

16:00.005 --> 16:01.245
Come on!

16:01.325 --> 16:03.005
Through to the live show!

16:03.085 --> 16:04.725
You better have something amazing
lined up.

16:04.805 --> 16:08.445
How does a magical, fantastical fashion
show sound?

16:08.525 --> 16:10.125
I still need a few more details, Indigo.

16:10.205 --> 16:11.485
What's your full address?

16:12.645 --> 16:13.645
Uh...

16:13.725 --> 16:14.725
Where do you live?

16:15.965 --> 16:17.605
-Uh...
-[voice on earpiece]

16:17.685 --> 16:19.605
Oops, gotta go, I'll be right back.

16:20.445 --> 16:21.845
[exhales sharply]

16:29.485 --> 16:30.605
We're too late.

16:31.965 --> 16:33.645
Maybe there's a back entrance?

16:41.405 --> 16:42.765
We can magic our way in.

16:42.845 --> 16:45.045
We have to find somewhere quiet to do it,
where there's no people.

16:45.125 --> 16:48.085
It's the big city.
There is nowhere quiet.

17:08.885 --> 17:11.485
Who checked you two in?
You really should have badges.

17:13.844 --> 17:16.925
You're the Giggle Girls, right?
Comedy duo?

17:18.165 --> 17:21.324
Yup! Yup, that's us, the Giggle Girls.

17:21.405 --> 17:22.604
[Mildred giggles nervously]

17:23.844 --> 17:25.445
Um, Mildred Hubble and--

17:25.525 --> 17:27.124
Maud De Lafontaine.

17:33.885 --> 17:35.765
[panting]

17:39.245 --> 17:40.205
Poor Ethel.

17:40.285 --> 17:43.165
Ten laps around the school
before she realized it was a wind up

17:43.245 --> 17:44.325
and gave us the slip.

17:44.405 --> 17:46.525
That's the best laugh I've had in ages.

17:46.605 --> 17:47.765
Mildred would've loved it.

17:47.845 --> 17:50.285
She is a true master at winding Ethel up.

17:51.085 --> 17:54.965
Hopefully we bought her and Maud
some time, wherever they are.

17:55.045 --> 17:56.285
They sound like great friends.

17:56.885 --> 17:59.445
You're so lucky to have them
to share all of this with.

18:00.165 --> 18:01.125
Yeah.

18:01.845 --> 18:03.125
I guess I really am.

18:11.725 --> 18:13.885
I'm Enid's friend, Doris.

18:14.365 --> 18:15.525
[Clarice] Well met, Doris.

18:15.605 --> 18:17.445
Enid, we can't find your mum anywhere.

18:17.525 --> 18:21.085
Whilst we're waiting, can I interview you
about her, for the<i> Daily Bubble</i>?

18:21.165 --> 18:22.725
-It'll be quick.
-Me?

18:25.285 --> 18:27.325
You'll wait here? You won't move?

18:27.405 --> 18:29.645
I'm worn out
after all that zooming about anyway.

18:47.885 --> 18:50.125
What is it, Ethel?

18:51.085 --> 18:55.125
Miss Hardbroom, you know me,
I don't like to tattle-tale.

18:55.205 --> 18:56.485
[potions bubbling]

18:57.045 --> 18:58.365
It's about Mildred...

18:59.245 --> 19:00.485
and Indigo.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.005
It's like a maze.

19:20.365 --> 19:21.645
What are you doing here?

19:21.725 --> 19:24.165
We're big fans of the show,
it's a thrill to be here.

19:24.245 --> 19:28.045
We came for you, obviously.
You're coming back with us.

19:28.485 --> 19:31.325
There you are! You two are up.
Time for your audition.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.605
[gasps] Wow.

19:46.725 --> 19:49.245
What do you think you've learned
from having a famous mum?

19:50.005 --> 19:53.005
My mum's made big sacrifices
to get where she is.

19:53.085 --> 19:56.685
[Enid] And because she loves me,
she didn't want that life for me.

19:57.445 --> 20:00.965
She put me in a great school,
I couldn't wish for better friends,

20:01.925 --> 20:04.125
even if sometimes I take them for granted.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.405
So, I guess what I've learned is,
appreciate what you have.

20:13.285 --> 20:14.365
Mum!

20:15.205 --> 20:16.525
The spell wore off.

20:16.605 --> 20:19.165
I'm so happy you're back.

20:19.245 --> 20:20.805
I'm so sorry for...

20:21.765 --> 20:22.605
everything.

20:22.685 --> 20:23.525
Don't be.

20:24.605 --> 20:26.205
Enid, I deserved it.

20:26.285 --> 20:29.165
I forget how important it is
to press pause every now and then.

20:29.805 --> 20:31.325
Focus on what really matters.

20:31.405 --> 20:34.125
Oh, I'm the one that should be sorry.

20:36.965 --> 20:38.485
I trust I am not interrupting.

20:38.565 --> 20:39.965
Enid Nightshade...

20:40.045 --> 20:42.165
I have received troubling reports

20:42.245 --> 20:45.445
that your friends have left school
without permission.

20:46.405 --> 20:49.845
They're, um, collecting mandragora root.

20:49.925 --> 20:54.525
For me. I'm gonna stay a little longer
and put on a show for the girls.

20:54.605 --> 20:56.085
If they do not get back in time,

20:56.165 --> 20:58.805
then you will all be in serious trouble.

21:08.885 --> 21:10.205
They'll be back in time.

21:10.765 --> 21:11.605
Trust me.

21:19.285 --> 21:20.365
On you go, girls.

21:26.365 --> 21:27.205
[Mildred chuckles]

21:27.285 --> 21:28.285
What do we do?

21:31.525 --> 21:34.045
[whispers] Buy me some time
to convince Indie to pull out.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.485
If she goes on, it's bye-bye everything.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.365
Buy time how? I don't have an act!

21:45.245 --> 21:46.405
[buzzer]

21:47.285 --> 21:48.645
That's not very nice.

21:52.725 --> 21:55.005
Come back with us, Indie. Please.

21:56.205 --> 21:57.045
No.

21:57.125 --> 22:00.245
You heard HB,
she says I don't belong there.

22:01.165 --> 22:02.165
She hates me.

22:02.245 --> 22:06.005
She hated me too at first,
but she's not as bad as she makes out.

22:10.085 --> 22:13.365
We're not supposed to use magic
for our own selfish reasons.

22:13.445 --> 22:15.085
It says so in the Witches' Code.

22:15.165 --> 22:18.645
I spent 30 years collecting moss
because of rubbish like that.

22:18.725 --> 22:21.005
Cackle's gave you a second chance, Indie.

22:21.645 --> 22:22.685
Don't blow it.

22:22.765 --> 22:24.565
This is my second chance,

22:24.645 --> 22:27.325
to be the old me
and go back to what I do best.

22:27.405 --> 22:29.405
I need this, Mildred!

22:30.365 --> 22:32.125
[rhythmic footsteps]

22:39.405 --> 22:40.925
[buzzer]

22:42.125 --> 22:45.485
I was like you.
I felt like I didn't belong at Cackle's.

22:46.045 --> 22:48.365
Felt like an imposter. But give it time.

22:48.445 --> 22:50.125
I've given it enough time!

22:50.205 --> 22:51.605
But what is there for you here?

22:51.685 --> 22:53.845
You've got no home, no family.

22:53.925 --> 22:55.085
What is there at Cackle's?

22:55.165 --> 22:57.685
Your friends. Me, Maud, Enid...

22:58.765 --> 23:00.525
Performing's all I have left.

23:01.165 --> 23:04.165
You have Star. He's pining for you.

23:05.165 --> 23:06.885
He's your dog.

23:06.965 --> 23:07.885
I know, but...

23:07.965 --> 23:09.845
I'm happy to share him
with a friend.

23:10.725 --> 23:11.965
He loves you, Indie.

23:12.885 --> 23:14.165
We all do.

23:14.685 --> 23:15.845
Please just come back.

23:15.925 --> 23:17.165
[sighs]

23:27.845 --> 23:29.085
[buzzer]

23:29.165 --> 23:31.125
Ha! I can do this all day.

23:39.045 --> 23:41.325
But... [chuckles nervously]
On second thoughts...

23:41.405 --> 23:42.565
bye!

23:44.165 --> 23:45.645
Time's up, we have to go!

23:45.725 --> 23:47.885
-Fly safely.
-You're not coming?

23:49.005 --> 23:50.405
You don't deserve a friend like Mil.

23:50.485 --> 23:52.165
-Leave it, Maud, she's decided.
-No!

23:52.245 --> 23:54.405
You put your future on line
to get her a second chance

23:54.485 --> 23:56.045
and now you'll be thrown out of school.

23:56.765 --> 23:58.005
All because of you.

23:58.085 --> 23:59.325
What's she talking about?

23:59.885 --> 24:03.805
I made a deal. So if you go, I go.

24:04.245 --> 24:05.205
You did that?

24:06.845 --> 24:08.205
You barely know me.

24:08.285 --> 24:10.445
Mildred Hubble believes in her friends.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.445
Why didn't you tell me?

24:13.525 --> 24:17.005
I wanted you to come back
for your own reasons, not mine.

24:18.405 --> 24:21.805
Please come back to Cackle's, Indie.
You belong with us.

24:23.245 --> 24:24.285
There they are.

24:39.525 --> 24:41.125
She's actually going to do it.

24:41.205 --> 24:42.205
[sighs]

24:49.445 --> 24:50.445
[sighs]

24:59.245 --> 25:00.645
[Indigo, flatly] Ta-da.

25:00.725 --> 25:01.805
[buzzer]

25:09.045 --> 25:12.605
What happened to the fantastical
fashion show? Where are you going?

25:13.285 --> 25:14.565
Home to my friends.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.965
[Enid] There's your biggest fan, Mum.

25:20.045 --> 25:21.525
Hello. What's your name?

25:22.405 --> 25:23.285
[thud]

25:23.365 --> 25:27.045
Who'd have thought? Front row at an
exclusive Narcissus Nightshade show.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.485
Pinch me.

25:28.565 --> 25:29.405
Ow!

25:30.605 --> 25:32.805
How much longer do you think
they're gonna be, darling?

25:32.885 --> 25:34.245
Just a few more minutes.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.605
[quiet chatter]

25:38.405 --> 25:40.485
Come on, Mil, get a wriggle on.

25:42.765 --> 25:43.845
Wait! I'm coming with you!

25:43.925 --> 25:45.605
[gasps] Yes!

25:47.725 --> 25:48.565
[they laugh]

25:51.725 --> 25:55.205
I am afraid it appears that Indigo Moon
and Mildred Hubble

25:55.285 --> 25:59.325
are guilty of a major violation
of school rules.

25:59.405 --> 26:00.645
Oh, that's it!

26:01.805 --> 26:03.685
I'll finally be rid of the pair of them!

26:03.765 --> 26:07.005
Cool. But... Hey, wait a minute, look!

26:10.405 --> 26:11.485
[chatter]

26:11.965 --> 26:13.005
Go.

26:18.365 --> 26:19.805
[crashing]

26:23.085 --> 26:24.725
[Indigo] Think we broke the speed limit.

26:27.245 --> 26:30.245
Where have you been?

26:30.325 --> 26:31.445
[Enid] Mildred! Maud,

26:31.525 --> 26:32.605
Indie.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.165
Come on, lend us a hand, would you?

26:35.685 --> 26:37.645
-Excuse us, Miss Hardbroom.
-You too, Indie.

26:42.405 --> 26:43.805
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

26:45.165 --> 26:47.765
I can't even imagine what my life
would be like without you two.

26:47.845 --> 26:48.885
[chuckles]

26:51.325 --> 26:52.605
I'm sorry to you too.

26:53.205 --> 26:54.965
I know that you were only doing your best.

26:55.045 --> 26:56.685
I'll try to be less annoying.

26:57.325 --> 27:00.365
I mean... no promises or anything.

27:00.445 --> 27:01.565
[they laugh]

27:03.085 --> 27:05.165
Better luck next time, Ethel.

27:05.245 --> 27:06.445
[Indigo] Thanks for coming to get me.

27:07.045 --> 27:07.885
And...

27:09.325 --> 27:10.925
And for believing in me.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.485
Now then, early birds.

27:15.565 --> 27:18.765
Here's a little taster
