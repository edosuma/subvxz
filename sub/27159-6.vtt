WEBVTT

00:05.266 --> 00:07.600
In total I had three
silicone removal

00:07.633 --> 00:10.367
surgeries. Right now
my butt caves in.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.433
You can see skin
from the front.

00:12.467 --> 00:14.166
To me, it looks
like I have balls.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.533
You're lucky to be alive,

00:16.567 --> 00:19.433
'cause those injections
could have killed you.

00:19.467 --> 00:20.533
Who does your filler?

00:20.567 --> 00:22.567
A woman from Manchester.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.266
Does she do it at a facility,

00:24.300 --> 00:25.500
or does she come
to your house?
At my house.

00:25.533 --> 00:26.500
You ever hear the expression

00:26.533 --> 00:27.567
"Don't try this at home"?

00:27.600 --> 00:29.133
[laughs]

00:29.166 --> 00:31.100
When the bandages
finally came off,

00:31.133 --> 00:32.500
my nose looked pinched in,

00:32.533 --> 00:34.033
and over the years,

00:34.066 --> 00:35.266
these bumps from
the tip of my nose

00:35.300 --> 00:36.567
started to appear.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.533
and then it started
to collapse even more.

00:38.567 --> 00:40.533
For me to make your tip
look normal again,

00:40.567 --> 00:42.266
I have to make it bigger.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.066
I'm just scared of making
the wrong decision

00:44.100 --> 00:45.500
or something.
I don't know.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.133
I'm 33 years old.

01:02.166 --> 01:03.533
I had silicone
removed from my butt

01:03.567 --> 01:04.600
to save my life,

01:04.633 --> 01:06.100
and now you can see my butt

01:06.133 --> 01:07.333
from the front.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.133
When I work out,
I put a girdle

01:10.166 --> 01:12.000
that pulls up all the skin
from the front.

01:12.033 --> 01:14.133
Then I put padded panties,

01:14.166 --> 01:15.333
and that
fills up those dents

01:15.367 --> 01:16.533
that I have on the side.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.066
Over all of that,

01:18.100 --> 01:19.333
I put compression shorts

01:19.367 --> 01:21.533
so that I tuck in
any scars that I have,

01:21.567 --> 01:24.333
and then I put my regular
shorts over that.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.400
It's like four or five layers
that I'm wearing every day.

01:27.433 --> 01:28.433
I started dancing

01:28.467 --> 01:29.567
when I was in high school.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.266
I would say I was about 23

01:31.300 --> 01:33.467
when I noticed that all
of the other dancers,

01:33.500 --> 01:35.166
they all had big butts,

01:35.200 --> 01:37.233
and they were making
a lot more money than me.

01:37.266 --> 01:40.400
My girl friend
was getting silicone
injections in her butt

01:40.433 --> 01:43.066
by this lady that would
fly in from Florida.

01:43.100 --> 01:44.633
She was a retired nurse.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.567
We met at a nice hotel.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.300
I laid down on the bed.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.633
She pulled out a huge needle,

01:49.667 --> 01:53.400
and she had, like,
red kegger cups

01:53.433 --> 01:55.667
that she was, like,
filling up with stuff,

01:55.700 --> 01:57.400
and I asked her what it was,

01:57.433 --> 01:59.433
and she said, like, silicone,

01:59.467 --> 02:02.500
but I didn't
ask enough questions.

02:02.533 --> 02:04.066
At that point in my life,

02:04.100 --> 02:06.567
I was so just,
like, living so crazy

02:06.600 --> 02:08.200
that I thought
I was invincible.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.133
The shots hurt,

02:10.166 --> 02:12.400
but I was really happy
with what I saw.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.600
The bigger my butt got,
the bigger my tips got.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.467
But I still wanted
to go bigger,

02:16.500 --> 02:18.600
so I called the lady
that was doing my injections.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.066
She wasn't
picking up her phone,

02:20.100 --> 02:21.266
so I called the friend of mine

02:21.300 --> 02:22.367
that went to her,

02:22.400 --> 02:23.633
and she was like, "Oh, no,

02:23.667 --> 02:25.166
"we're not dealing
with her anymore,

02:25.200 --> 02:26.400
but there's somebody else."

02:26.433 --> 02:28.400
And it ended up
being a couple of women

02:28.433 --> 02:30.233
that come from Colombia.

02:30.266 --> 02:32.200
It was years later
when I found out

02:32.233 --> 02:34.266
that the lady that did
my first set of injections

02:34.300 --> 02:35.667
was actually in prison.

02:35.700 --> 02:39.200
The first time I met with
the women from Colombia,

02:39.233 --> 02:41.600
that's when I had
my boyfriend Kyle take me.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.100
He tried to talk me
out of it.

02:43.133 --> 02:44.367
He told me it was stupid,

02:44.400 --> 02:46.333
but I wasn't
listening to anybody.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.500
We went to an apartment.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.233
They started pumping me up.

02:50.266 --> 02:52.633
And again, I just had no idea

02:52.667 --> 02:54.300
what they had put in there.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.300
And there was a big mirror
in front of me,

02:56.333 --> 02:57.700
and I just remember
looking up at the mirror,

02:57.734 --> 03:00.467
and I had never seen myself
so pale in my life.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.300
I called Kyle to come in,

03:02.333 --> 03:03.533
and that's when he knew

03:03.567 --> 03:05.233
that he had to take me
to the hospital.

03:05.266 --> 03:07.367
I was in ICU for two weeks.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.567
I was in there
on Thanksgiving,

03:08.600 --> 03:09.667
and Kyle tried to bring me

03:09.700 --> 03:11.233
a Thanksgiving plate,

03:11.266 --> 03:12.400
but I wasn't even--

03:14.400 --> 03:15.633
I don't remember,

03:15.667 --> 03:17.533
but I really had, like--

03:17.567 --> 03:20.600
like, a big wake-up
call because,

03:20.633 --> 03:23.266
for anybody to stick with me
through all of that,

03:23.300 --> 03:25.767
especially since we
had only been dating
for a few months,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.533
I knew that he
really loved me,

03:27.567 --> 03:30.166
and I really didn't
want to lose him.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.533
I was done
with the injections,

03:31.567 --> 03:32.700
I was done with dancing,

03:32.734 --> 03:35.233
and I wanted
to just be with Kyle.

03:35.266 --> 03:38.266
A couple months after that,
my health went downhill.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.533
I knew that it was my butt.
Now I wanted out.

03:40.567 --> 03:43.633
In total I had three
silicone removal surgeries.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.266
This is my butt.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.400
Right now my butt caves in,

03:47.433 --> 03:49.767
and then you can actually
see skin from the front.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.400
It's just like hanging.

03:51.433 --> 03:53.133
To me, it looks
like I have balls,

03:53.166 --> 03:56.467
and that is what I can't
deal with anymore.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.266
Now that my health
is under control,

03:58.300 --> 04:00.400
getting my butt fixed
is the last thing

04:00.433 --> 04:01.533
that I need to do

04:01.567 --> 04:02.567
for myself.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.200
Every single day,

04:04.233 --> 04:05.533
I'm constantly reminded

04:05.567 --> 04:08.300
of the stupid person
that I used to be.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.734
It all happened for a reason.
There's no--

04:09.767 --> 04:11.500
There's nothing
you can do about it.

04:11.533 --> 04:13.333
You can't take it back.
You can't go back in time,

04:13.367 --> 04:14.700
so move forward.

04:14.734 --> 04:18.166
It makes me feel horrible
because I understand

04:18.200 --> 04:19.633
why she feels
the way she does.

04:19.667 --> 04:21.367
She just made
some bad mistakes,

04:21.400 --> 04:22.667
which we have to deal with
at this point.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.200
That's the only thing

04:24.233 --> 04:25.600
that's holding me back
at this point

04:25.633 --> 04:28.433
is I don't want to get married

04:28.467 --> 04:31.300
and have all of this
going on.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.166
Kyle and I are already
committed to each other,

04:33.200 --> 04:36.000
but to just have
that final step and have

04:36.033 --> 04:37.533
that traditional wedding
that I've always wanted

04:37.567 --> 04:39.266
would just mean
the world to me.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.433
And I can't do that
until my butt is fixed.

04:41.467 --> 04:43.200
This will be
our final chapter.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.734
I'm Cindy Moore.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.400
I think, like,
that name suits me
because I want to be

04:50.433 --> 04:52.734
more extreme, more glamorous,

04:52.767 --> 04:54.633
I just want
more of everything.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.533
I want my boobs
a lot bigger,

04:57.567 --> 04:59.233
my lips a lot bigger,

04:59.266 --> 05:01.333
[laughing]
and my waist a lot smaller.

05:02.767 --> 05:04.467
I like to work out naked.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.767
When you're working out,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.533
little bits
are curling around.

05:07.567 --> 05:09.367
Your belly's
wobbling and stuff,

05:09.400 --> 05:10.767
so, as I'm working out,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.033
I can see what I don't like.

05:13.066 --> 05:15.333
It just gives me
a little bit more motivation.

05:15.367 --> 05:18.367
So I just have a strange
way of doing things.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.433
When I was young, I wore
a trainer's track suit,

05:21.467 --> 05:22.700
my hair tied back,

05:22.734 --> 05:25.000
with my one glove--
[laughing]--

05:25.033 --> 05:26.600
thinking I was
Michael Jackson.

05:26.633 --> 05:28.233
I think I went
through a stage

05:28.266 --> 05:30.433
that I thought
I was a cowgirl,

05:30.467 --> 05:32.266
so I used to always
wear the hat

05:32.300 --> 05:33.767
and the shorts
and the boots.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.233
As I've got older,

05:35.266 --> 05:37.400
I just started
to look at Dolly Parton,

05:37.433 --> 05:39.667
Pamela Anderson,
and I just thought,

05:39.700 --> 05:41.333
like, "Where's my boobs?"

05:41.367 --> 05:43.367
[laughing]
I have none.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.533
I was completely
flat chested,

05:45.567 --> 05:47.500
and that is when I decided

05:47.533 --> 05:49.433
just to revamp my image.

05:49.467 --> 05:50.633
When I first
got my boobs done,

05:50.667 --> 05:52.400
they were just very perky.

05:52.433 --> 05:54.066
I didn't
need to wear a bra.
They just stood up.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.633
After I had my daughter
and my son,

05:56.667 --> 05:58.066
I was really big,

05:58.100 --> 06:00.600
and I just felt ugly, fat.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.767
I just felt disgusted.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.533
When I started losing weight,

06:04.567 --> 06:06.567
instead of buying myself
a cake at the shop,

06:06.600 --> 06:09.367
I'd go on eBay
and get a little outfit.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.066
The more I toned up,

06:11.100 --> 06:12.700
then I started to wear
littler outfits,

06:12.734 --> 06:14.400
littler outfits,

06:14.433 --> 06:16.533
and I started posting
them on Instagram

06:16.567 --> 06:18.400
and getting
a bit of a following.

06:18.433 --> 06:21.266
All the mums at school
always give me dirty looks.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.433
Probably think,
"How is she doing this,

06:23.467 --> 06:25.700
turning up at, like,
8:00 in the morning?"

06:25.734 --> 06:27.600
Really over the top,
dolled up--

06:27.633 --> 06:30.000
makeup, hair, red lips.

06:30.033 --> 06:32.533
I have a very unconventional
way of doing my makeup,

06:32.567 --> 06:34.400
so I have, like,
a normal ink pen

06:34.433 --> 06:37.000
that I just use
to draw my eyebrows on.

06:37.033 --> 06:40.033
I think I would rather
go outside naked

06:40.066 --> 06:41.734
than I would
without any makeup

06:41.767 --> 06:43.000
or my lipstick on.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.734
[laughing]

06:44.767 --> 06:47.000
I want to talk to the doctors
regarding my lips

06:47.033 --> 06:50.100
because I've got, like,
quite a lump on one side

06:50.133 --> 06:53.033
from getting my lips injected
every couple of weeks.

06:53.066 --> 06:56.367
I want my lips just as big
as they can possibly go

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
without popping off my face.
That would be brilliant.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.633
I'm hoping the doctors
will be able to give me

07:00.667 --> 07:02.033
my dream boobs.

07:02.066 --> 07:05.100
I would like
the size of the two now

07:05.133 --> 07:08.467
as one to bring them
up to 2,000 CCs.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.633
I'd love to have
my top ribs removed

07:10.667 --> 07:13.333
just to give me
more of a tiny frame.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.567
That really fake look

07:15.600 --> 07:17.467
is the look
that I want to have.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.433
I just like to look
like a bimbo,

07:19.467 --> 07:21.700
but that's not
who I am inside.

07:21.734 --> 07:24.333
I think on the inside
you've got to know who you are.

07:24.367 --> 07:25.533
Be strong. Be intelligent.

07:25.567 --> 07:26.734
But there's no harm

07:26.767 --> 07:28.033
in looking like a bimbo

07:28.066 --> 07:29.367
while you're doing that.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.567
So I'm doing these two

07:36.600 --> 07:38.767
horrible complex cases
on Friday,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.133
so then, right
at the end of surgery,

07:40.166 --> 07:42.033
my head just starts
boom, boom.

07:42.066 --> 07:43.066
Headache.
Temple.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.133
God, am I dehydrated?

07:44.166 --> 07:45.500
What the hell's going on?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.567
So I ended up having
2 liters of fluid

07:47.600 --> 07:49.333
after surgery.
You had them start an IV.

07:49.367 --> 07:50.667
Oh, yeah. I'd go like this.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.533
I had them use
a little bit of lidocaine

07:52.567 --> 07:54.533
to numb the area up,
and then put the needle in.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.100
You started an IV

07:56.133 --> 07:58.767
to get fluids
in your body?
I don't know.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.100
Do you ever think
about a juice box?

08:03.667 --> 08:06.633
Here's someone
who had a major disaster

08:06.667 --> 08:08.633
from silicone injections

08:08.667 --> 08:12.000
and has had procedures
already.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.000
There it is.
Oh. Jeepers.

08:14.033 --> 08:16.400
So they've had
extensive operations.

08:16.433 --> 08:18.000
Let's bring her in
and see if we can help.

08:18.033 --> 08:20.533
Her name's Tomi.
Can you please send in Tomi?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.767
Hi.
Dr. Nassif.
Nice to meet you.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.066
Hi. Terry Dubrow.
Nice to meet you.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.100
Hi. Nice to meet you.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.367
I've had a lot of doctors

08:27.400 --> 08:28.433
tell me that

08:28.467 --> 08:29.633
I basically should probably

08:29.667 --> 08:31.667
just live like this
and be happy,

08:31.700 --> 08:33.033
but I'm just hoping
that Dr. Dubrow

08:33.066 --> 08:34.500
doesn't tell me
the same thing.

08:34.533 --> 08:36.400
You had silicone injections
in your buttock, yes?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.033
When was the first episode

08:38.066 --> 08:40.000
of silicone injection?
2010.

08:40.033 --> 08:41.533
Where did you have
the butt injections done?

08:41.567 --> 08:42.667
They were in a hotel room.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.433
So this person
would come in.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.166
She would fly in
from Florida.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.500
What would she
inject in you?

08:47.533 --> 08:49.133
One time, after she left,

08:49.166 --> 08:51.734
some of the stuff
had fell out on the counter,

08:51.767 --> 08:53.133
and I wanted to see
what it was,

08:53.166 --> 08:54.633
so I went like that.
It was like oil.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.000
That's most likely

08:56.033 --> 08:58.567
non-medical grade silicone.
Yeah.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.033
Non-medical grade silicone
is industrial,

09:01.066 --> 09:04.500
something that you might
use in machine parts
or something like that.

09:04.533 --> 09:06.567
You don't want that
injected in your body.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.233
How many times
did you have the silicone
buttock injections done?

09:09.266 --> 09:12.767
By her, probably, like,
five or six times.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.467
Oh, is she--
By her?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.000
[Nassif]
You mean there's more?
Yeah.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.133
What happened to her?

09:17.166 --> 09:18.467
She went to jail.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.000
Buying industrial
grade silicone

09:20.033 --> 09:21.667
and injecting it
into someone's body

09:21.700 --> 09:23.133
doesn't make you
a surgeon,

09:23.166 --> 09:25.433
but it may put you
behind bars.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.400
And then what happened?
You stopped doing it?

09:27.433 --> 09:29.600
I went to see someone new.

09:29.633 --> 09:32.600
So these ladies
had came from Colombia.

09:32.633 --> 09:35.166
So they do it, though,
and she gets sick instantly,

09:35.200 --> 09:36.667
so I rush her
to the hospital.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.100
They put her in ICU
right away,

09:38.133 --> 09:39.400
and she was there
for a while.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.000
Two weeks.
Two weeks?

09:41.033 --> 09:42.667
For about a week and a half,
she was kind of out of it,

09:42.700 --> 09:45.133
like you could look at her,
but she wasn't there.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.567
I thought for a while there
I did think

09:46.600 --> 09:48.700
she was gonna
stay kind of like that,

09:48.734 --> 09:51.133
and at that point
I didn't know what to do.

09:51.166 --> 09:53.033
Did you tell them
what you had done?

09:53.066 --> 09:54.233
No.
They had no idea?

09:54.266 --> 09:55.500
You didn't tell them?

09:55.533 --> 09:56.633
I made him promise me

09:56.667 --> 09:58.133
that he wouldn't
say anything--

09:58.166 --> 10:00.266
Why?
I thought they were
gonna cut my butt out.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.734
I couldn't have that done.
Yeah, but you
could have died.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.600
I couldn't work.
Living is more
important than working.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.066
At the time, I was an idiot.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.033
It was so dumb.
I'm so dumb.

10:09.066 --> 10:12.000
Years later, I had
extreme joint pain,

10:12.033 --> 10:13.233
and that's
when they found out

10:13.266 --> 10:15.533
I had high levels
of uric acid and calcium.

10:15.567 --> 10:18.000
And my blood pressure
was really high.

10:18.033 --> 10:20.100
They made me go
right to the hospital.

10:20.133 --> 10:22.133
That's when I met
my kidney specialist.

10:22.166 --> 10:24.266
Did they give you
a diagnosis as to what--

10:24.300 --> 10:27.000
No, but at this point, we're
telling them, "Okay, look,

10:27.033 --> 10:28.500
"she had these injections
years ago.

10:28.533 --> 10:29.633
We think
this is what it is."

10:29.667 --> 10:31.233
Finally,
the kidney doctor said,

10:31.266 --> 10:32.667
"Let's go get some
of this stuff taken out."

10:32.700 --> 10:35.266
So it's that silicone
floating in her,

10:35.300 --> 10:37.200
in her vascular space.
Exactly.

10:37.233 --> 10:38.734
This is the first time
I've heard

10:38.767 --> 10:40.633
of someone
having kidney failure

10:40.667 --> 10:43.266
following injections
to the body.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.734
You then went where
to have--

10:44.767 --> 10:46.533
To a Beverly Hills
plastic surgeon.

10:46.567 --> 10:47.734
He took out some stuff
from the bottom,

10:47.767 --> 10:49.600
but I still had
all of this up at the top.

10:49.633 --> 10:53.233
So then I find, um,
a plastic surgeon in Arizona,

10:53.266 --> 10:57.200
and he did two surgeries,
taking it all out.

10:57.233 --> 10:58.700
And what happened
to your health after that?

10:58.734 --> 11:01.066
It got better.
What are your goals?

11:01.100 --> 11:03.133
I just don't want it
to look

11:03.166 --> 11:05.266
like I got attacked
by a shark.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.767
And it's so--
Flat.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.133
It even indents a little
on the sides.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.133
Okay.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.767
Tomi's case represents

11:12.000 --> 11:13.734
a really scary situation.

11:13.767 --> 11:15.734
I hope I can help her,

11:15.767 --> 11:18.200
but if she has
any residual silicone

11:18.233 --> 11:20.133
traveling
around in her body,

11:20.166 --> 11:23.734
surgery could make
her situation much worse

11:23.767 --> 11:26.066
and lead to total
kidney failure.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.633
Let's be honest.
You're lucky to be alive

11:29.667 --> 11:32.033
because those injections
could have killed you.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.734
So let's go
be afraid together

11:33.767 --> 11:36.000
and examine things
and figure it out, okay?

11:36.033 --> 11:37.100
Okay, sounds good.
Okay.

11:38.133 --> 11:39.667
You see how this feels

11:39.700 --> 11:41.333
like it's not even
connected on my body?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.533
Like what is that?

11:42.567 --> 11:44.133
Is that
a big granuloma?

11:46.233 --> 11:48.600
Your doctor basically
said, "Do you want me
to pinch in your nose?"

11:48.633 --> 11:50.066
Yes. Exactly.
Interesting.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.533
Your nasal tip
was normal?

11:51.567 --> 11:53.700
Oh, my nasal tip was fine.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.000
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

11:59.033 --> 12:01.300
First of all, I just
want to have a look

12:01.333 --> 12:03.600
at the contour.
I want to assess

12:03.633 --> 12:06.200
that extra piece
hanging down.
Yes.

12:06.233 --> 12:07.767
Projection component

12:08.000 --> 12:10.166
is the thing
I'm most worried about.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.033
Tomi's goal may be

12:12.066 --> 12:14.100
to have more
buttock volume

12:14.133 --> 12:15.367
and buttock projection,

12:15.400 --> 12:18.100
but she doesn't have
enough body fat anywhere

12:18.133 --> 12:20.066
to transfer
to her buttock area.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.700
And the only other way
is buttock implants,

12:22.734 --> 12:25.033
which, unfortunately,
I'm very against.

12:25.066 --> 12:27.266
Look at this, Paul.
She actually has droopiness

12:27.300 --> 12:28.667
on both sides, right?
Yeah.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.633
But one way more
than the other.
Right.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.700
Okay, now do me a favor.
Turn around.

12:32.734 --> 12:34.367
Do you see how this feels

12:34.400 --> 12:36.433
like it's not even
connected on my body?

12:36.467 --> 12:37.667
Like, what is that?

12:37.700 --> 12:39.200
Is that
a big granuloma?

12:39.233 --> 12:40.600
Sadly, we are no strangers

12:40.633 --> 12:42.066
to granuloma formation.

12:42.100 --> 12:43.400
It's the body's

12:43.433 --> 12:45.333
defense mechanism
to create scar tissue

12:45.367 --> 12:46.400
when you have something

12:46.433 --> 12:47.667
like liquid silicone
injected.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.000
Overall droopiness down there

12:50.033 --> 12:52.200
I think can be improved.
Projection?

12:52.233 --> 12:53.734
I don't think
you're a good candidate

12:53.767 --> 12:55.767
for buttock implants.
No.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.367
Your body is super charged

12:58.400 --> 13:01.066
in its defense to silicone.

13:01.100 --> 13:04.200
Could you imagine,
if we put a big hunking
butt implant in there,

13:04.233 --> 13:07.066
what your immune system's
gonna do when it sees that?

13:07.100 --> 13:08.333
Remember,
the whole goal right now

13:08.367 --> 13:10.767
is to preserve and improve
your kidney function.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.233
I'm a little disappointed

13:12.266 --> 13:13.633
that Dr. Dubrow couldn't
give me implants

13:13.667 --> 13:14.767
so I can have

13:15.000 --> 13:16.233
that volume that I wanted,

13:16.266 --> 13:18.066
but, at the end
of the day,

13:18.100 --> 13:19.200
I just want to move on

13:19.233 --> 13:20.734
and have a healthy,
nice life.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.767
If you could actually
elevate that floppy tissue,

13:24.000 --> 13:25.467
you know, just
to make her feel better,

13:25.500 --> 13:27.367
and maybe do the shelf--
Mm-hmm.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.033
...if you can get rid
of that,

13:29.066 --> 13:30.400
which is also silicone,

13:30.433 --> 13:32.100
that's gonna help her
from her health standpoint.

13:32.133 --> 13:34.100
How do you feel about
an additional scar

13:34.133 --> 13:36.066
that goes through
your tattoo across the--
I'm okay with it.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.200
It's rare that Terry and I
get in a situation

13:38.233 --> 13:41.700
where we have to remove
something foreign

13:41.734 --> 13:43.233
to help with someone's health.

13:43.266 --> 13:44.667
And in this case,
that's what we're doing.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.300
That's more important
than anything.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.700
Cosmetic appearance
comes second.

13:48.734 --> 13:50.400
And then, uh, you know,

13:50.433 --> 13:51.467
we're gonna do
a lot of this:

13:51.500 --> 13:53.166
mmm.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
I'm so excited.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.400
I mean, he's, like,

13:55.433 --> 13:57.066
the god
of plastic surgery,

13:57.100 --> 13:58.400
so I'm in the best hands.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.000
Pleasure.
Thank you so much.

14:00.033 --> 14:01.400
Nice to meet you.
Thank you, thank you.

14:01.433 --> 14:03.133
Sometimes,
when I'm reading to you,

14:03.166 --> 14:04.400
what do you do?

14:04.433 --> 14:08.266
Uh, what are those bumps
on your nose?

14:08.300 --> 14:10.133
Yeah. He'll look at me
and say,

14:10.166 --> 14:11.667
"Am I gonna
get those bumps?"

14:11.700 --> 14:13.000
You're always worried
that you're gonna

14:13.033 --> 14:14.133
somehow
end up getting bumps

14:14.166 --> 14:15.700
on the end
of your nose, right?

14:15.734 --> 14:17.667
My name's Katie, and I'm
from Baltimore, Maryland,

14:17.700 --> 14:19.133
and I'm 41 years old.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.333
My nose has bumps
on each side,

14:21.367 --> 14:23.133
a crease down the center,

14:23.166 --> 14:25.500
and nostrils
that are sky high.

14:25.533 --> 14:28.033
It looks like a hot mess.

14:29.066 --> 14:30.500
When I got into high school,

14:30.533 --> 14:33.166
at that point in time
I'd reached 6'1".

14:33.200 --> 14:35.066
I've always liked to keep
an active lifestyle,

14:35.100 --> 14:36.367
and I love sports.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.700
Within four years,

14:37.734 --> 14:40.100
I had broken my nose
four times,

14:40.133 --> 14:42.000
and my mom would
always just say,

14:42.033 --> 14:44.166
"Well, let's put ice on it
and see how it is."

14:44.200 --> 14:47.533
Well, over time,
my nose had become so wide

14:47.567 --> 14:49.200
and had a hump.

14:49.233 --> 14:50.767
That's when we knew it's time

14:51.000 --> 14:52.233
to go talk to a doctor.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.467
We had remembered

14:53.500 --> 14:55.367
that my friend
had a birthmark removed,

14:55.400 --> 14:57.467
so my mom found out the name
of the plastic surgeon.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.400
Looking back on it,
I think to myself,

14:59.433 --> 15:02.033
removing a birthmark
is a whole lot different

15:02.066 --> 15:03.433
than having rhinoplasty.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.066
The day of surgery,

15:05.100 --> 15:06.533
the doctor suddenly came up

15:06.567 --> 15:08.233
with a whole new plan.

15:08.266 --> 15:10.000
He said, "Well, I think

15:10.033 --> 15:11.467
"your daughter's nose
doesn't look that normal,

15:11.500 --> 15:13.133
"so we're gonna
have to pinch it in

15:13.166 --> 15:14.333
a little bit near the tip."

15:14.367 --> 15:16.333
And my mom just
trusted the doctor.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.266
She was put on the spot
at the last minute.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.233
And my mom was
kind of like, "Okay.

15:20.266 --> 15:22.166
"If that's what you think
you're supposed to do,

15:22.200 --> 15:24.333
then-- then go ahead
and do that."

15:24.367 --> 15:26.533
When the bandages
finally came off,

15:26.567 --> 15:28.200
my nose looked pinched in.

15:28.233 --> 15:29.467
Then, over the years,

15:29.500 --> 15:31.200
these bumps on
the tip of my nose

15:31.233 --> 15:32.433
started to appear.

15:32.467 --> 15:33.767
It continued to get worse

15:34.000 --> 15:35.266
and worse and worse.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.400
And then it started
to collapse even more

15:37.433 --> 15:38.500
and pinch in even more.

15:38.533 --> 15:40.033
I get worried that,

15:40.066 --> 15:41.533
if I continue
living with this nose,

15:41.567 --> 15:44.166
is it gonna continue
to collapse?

15:44.200 --> 15:45.400
Because that would be
kind of frightening.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.533
Always have fun
helping you with this.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.233
Well, I love
having you help.

15:49.266 --> 15:51.433
For my job, I stand
in front of people

15:51.467 --> 15:53.066
and teach them how to paint.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.066
Did you know that I've
actually been painting

15:55.100 --> 15:57.100
with my right hand
instead of my left hand?

15:57.133 --> 15:59.133
Really?
This is the part
of the nose

15:59.166 --> 16:01.333
that I don't like a lot,
so I've kind of trained myself

16:01.367 --> 16:03.367
to teach right-handed.
How can you do that?

16:03.400 --> 16:05.600
I've been teaching myself
to paint with my right hand,

16:05.633 --> 16:07.500
which is really frustrating
'cause that is not
how I paint.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.200
I paint left-handed

16:09.233 --> 16:11.233
because I don't like
this side of my nose.

16:11.266 --> 16:12.567
Back then,
they didn't have Google

16:12.600 --> 16:14.467
and couldn't really
research surgeons, so--

16:14.500 --> 16:17.567
Yeah, I probably should have
asked more questions,

16:17.600 --> 16:20.533
not let him do what he
said he wanted to do

16:20.567 --> 16:23.333
five seconds
before the surgery.

16:23.367 --> 16:25.033
I never really
let my mom know

16:25.066 --> 16:26.567
just how frustrated
and upset I was

16:26.600 --> 16:28.266
about the results
for my initial

16:28.300 --> 16:30.233
nose surgery.
Part of that was because

16:30.266 --> 16:31.767
I just didn't want to feel
like I was ungrateful

16:32.000 --> 16:33.500
for the fact that I had
just had surgery done.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.000
Well, sometimes I feel
guilty about that.

16:36.033 --> 16:37.266
No, I--
I was the adult.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.633
I should have just
told the doctor,

16:38.667 --> 16:40.367
"Just take the bump off.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.100
Leave the nose the way it is.
I like her nose."

16:42.133 --> 16:44.166
Yeah.
So I made a snap decision

16:44.200 --> 16:46.467
and said, "Well, okay,"
and I-- I regret it.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.200
Well, I'm hoping
that Katie can get

16:48.233 --> 16:50.266
this surgery
'cause, after 25 years,

16:50.300 --> 16:52.367
I can finally feel
at peace, too.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.100
I don't want you
to feel bad about it.

Oh. Crap.

17:01.433 --> 17:03.400
Wow.
She got big bossa.

This is a hard nose.
This is a super hard nose.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.400
I think that means

17:12.433 --> 17:14.033
that you've reached

I'm Dr. Nassif.
Nice to meet you, too.

17:25.467 --> 17:27.166
Hi, Katie. You're tall.
How are you?

17:27.200 --> 17:28.567
Yes, I am.
This is my mom.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.066

You have a tall dad?

17:30.100 --> 17:31.367
Yes. He's 6'5",

17:31.400 --> 17:33.200
so I definitely
don't get it
from my mom.

17:33.233 --> 17:34.433
Your mom's not short.
No.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.166
Mom's taller
than you, Paul.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.433
[laughing]

17:37.467 --> 17:39.433
Make fun all you want, Terry,

17:39.467 --> 17:42.633
but I'm very popular
with the ladies.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.400
Uh, you had some trauma
to your nose,

17:44.433 --> 17:45.467
or what--
what's going on with--

17:45.500 --> 17:46.533
I played softball,

17:46.567 --> 17:49.066
and I broke my nose
four times.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.166
And I feel every time, like,
there was a bump here

17:51.200 --> 17:53.300
that would like of get,
like, wider or bigger.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.133
Then I had trouble breathing.

17:55.166 --> 17:58.266
So my mom's like, "Well,
maybe we should see somebody."

17:58.300 --> 18:00.633
So I had nose surgery
at age 15.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.600
And that was 25 years ago.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.600
The morning of surgery,
that doctor,

18:04.633 --> 18:06.233
he dropped a bomb on my mom.

18:06.266 --> 18:08.333
Well, he said,
"Well, while I'm in there,

18:08.367 --> 18:10.200
do you want me
to pull her nose in here?"

18:10.233 --> 18:12.467
Your doctor basically
said, "You want me
to pinch in your nose?"

18:12.500 --> 18:14.433
Yes. Exactly. Exactly.
[Nassif]
Interesting.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.300
Your nasal tip
was normal?

18:16.333 --> 18:17.500
Oh, my nasal tip
was fine.

18:17.533 --> 18:20.133
Yeah.
The only issue
was up here, so--

18:20.166 --> 18:21.633
Katie fell victim

18:21.667 --> 18:25.233
to the surgeon's
"while I'm there"
maneuver

18:25.266 --> 18:27.133
the day of surgery.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.266
Never a good idea.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.133
Never allow a surgeon
to do that.

18:32.166 --> 18:35.266
I feel bad because I feel
like it was my decision

18:35.300 --> 18:37.567
that caused the problem
in the first place.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.467
So you made
the decision for her.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.333
I did. I did.
Aw.

18:41.367 --> 18:43.266
I feel sad for my mom.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.400
If Dr. Dubrow and

18:45.433 --> 18:47.500
Dr. Nassif are able
to do this surgery on me,

18:47.533 --> 18:50.133
we can put this chapter
behind us

18:50.166 --> 18:51.200
and move forward from here.

18:51.233 --> 18:52.467
The reason we have

18:52.500 --> 18:54.133
preoperative consultations
with patients

18:54.166 --> 18:56.600
is because we decide
what your goals are,

18:56.633 --> 18:57.734
tell you
what the risks are

18:57.767 --> 18:59.266
to make sure
you understand them,

18:59.300 --> 19:00.567
can ask questions
about them,

19:00.600 --> 19:02.333
and that's it.
You have a game plan.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.500
So is there a way
you can just kind of

19:04.533 --> 19:06.734
simply list your goals
for your nose?

19:06.767 --> 19:09.266
When I look in the mirror,
when I'm getting ready
in the morning,

19:09.300 --> 19:11.367
I want to just
take a razor blade
and go fft-fft

19:11.400 --> 19:12.633
and then get
those bumps off.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.533
The bumps that Katie
is complaining about

19:14.567 --> 19:16.133
are called bossa.

19:16.166 --> 19:19.500
These are the cut edges
of her tip cartilage.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.100
And, as time goes on,

19:21.133 --> 19:23.600
they can and usually
do get worse.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.300
It sounds like you want
to basically try

19:25.333 --> 19:26.633
to get a normal-looking
nose.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.266
Yeah.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.734
Let's go to the exam room

19:29.767 --> 19:31.633
and take a look
at your nose.

19:31.667 --> 19:35.300
This stuff is a reaction
to silicone.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.266
These are called
silicone granulomas.

20:10.767 --> 20:12.266
The middle vault is narrow.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.700
The tip cartilage
has been over-resected.

20:14.734 --> 20:18.300
Alar retraction,
a bifid columella,

20:18.333 --> 20:20.200

add tissue to your nostrils--

as you know, okay?

22:28.066 --> 22:30.433
The excisual procedures
you had

22:30.467 --> 22:31.700

What I'm worried about

to move things around,

and I'm hoping
that I don't put silicone

22:37.333 --> 22:41.300
into the system that
may affect your kidney
function adversely.

Tomi is entrusting me

22:50.033 --> 22:52.133
that deposit
into her kidneys,

22:52.166 --> 22:54.100
damage them further,

22:54.133 --> 22:56.500
and lead to an even
worse problem

than she already has.

try to improve the droopiness
of the buttock,

23:07.767 --> 23:10.133
and that area
that's down below

23:10.166 --> 23:11.667
that you can see
from the front,

23:11.700 --> 23:13.700
but I'm not sure how well
I'll be able to do it

23:13.734 --> 23:15.066
without having her stand up

23:15.100 --> 23:16.333
in the middle of the operation,

23:16.367 --> 23:17.767
which, of course,
is not possible.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.000
I'll start Tomi's surgery

23:24.033 --> 23:25.600
by making
a transverse incision

23:25.633 --> 23:27.600
across the lower
portion of her back.

23:27.633 --> 23:30.700
Next, I'll excise as much
silicone as possible,

23:30.734 --> 23:33.700
remove excess tissue,
and perform a buttock lift.

23:33.734 --> 23:36.500
Finally, I'll remove skin
from the gluteal area

23:36.533 --> 23:37.767
to eliminate the ability

23:38.000 --> 23:39.600
to see the buttock
from the front.

23:39.633 --> 23:41.100
Hopefully,
this will give Tomi

23:41.133 --> 23:42.633
a nice buttock contour.

23:42.667 --> 23:45.000
So we start by making
a transverse incision,

23:45.033 --> 23:47.567
which is essentially
a horizontal incision
across her back,

23:47.600 --> 23:50.100
and then see what we find

23:50.133 --> 23:52.433
and start undermining
and elevating

23:52.467 --> 23:55.200
and hopefully removing
as much silicone as possible.

23:55.233 --> 23:58.000
In the past, I've been able
to augment the buttock

23:58.033 --> 24:00.467
by using the patient's
own tissue

24:00.500 --> 24:02.100
and rotating
into the buttock area

24:02.133 --> 24:03.700
to add projection.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.500
But because of Tomi's
silicone injections

24:05.533 --> 24:06.567
in the past,

24:06.600 --> 24:08.433
that's no longer an option.

24:08.467 --> 24:11.533
These are three--
1, 2, 3-- silicone balls.

24:11.567 --> 24:13.633
Look what happens
if you squeeze this.

24:13.667 --> 24:14.700
Uh.
Ucch.

24:14.734 --> 24:16.467
This is the one area

24:16.500 --> 24:18.000
she really hasn't had
a lot removed.

24:18.033 --> 24:19.734
And look, this is all
silicone in here, too.

24:19.767 --> 24:22.000
Tomi may have asked
for a shelf,

24:22.033 --> 24:24.500
but instead she received
a silicone bookcase.

24:24.533 --> 24:27.066
This stuff is a reaction
to silicone.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.200
These are called
silicone granulomas.

24:29.233 --> 24:31.734
This is the body's attempt

24:31.767 --> 24:34.700
to form scar tissue
around the silicone

24:34.734 --> 24:36.233
and wall it off.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.700
She has them everywhere.

24:37.734 --> 24:38.734
What a mess.

24:38.767 --> 24:40.033
Yes.

24:40.066 --> 24:41.133
This has just got to be

24:41.166 --> 24:42.567
a very dangerous case.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.100
Tomi's last three operations

24:44.133 --> 24:45.533
were just to remove silicone,

24:45.567 --> 24:47.767
and that's all
I've done so far.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.600
If I can't give her
some semblance

24:49.633 --> 24:51.166
of a shape,

24:51.200 --> 24:52.734
we're both gonna be
disappointed.

24:52.767 --> 24:54.633
All right,
so if we can move this,

24:54.667 --> 24:57.166
at least we're gonna
do some good for sure.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.033
That would give her
a big debulking.

25:00.066 --> 25:03.000
This is all basically
just silicone

25:03.033 --> 25:05.100
and silicone reaction.

25:05.133 --> 25:06.633
Goodbye.

25:06.667 --> 25:07.700
Look at that.
Yeah.

25:07.734 --> 25:10.667
Normal back.
Very happy with this.

25:10.700 --> 25:12.633
And now we have to
commit to a lift.

25:12.667 --> 25:14.033
So what about this?

25:14.066 --> 25:16.066
[stapler clicks]
That's pretty good.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.500
Now I think we're gonna
remove an ellipse of skin

25:18.533 --> 25:23.467
from the lower portion
of the droopy skin
of the gluteal area

25:23.500 --> 25:25.166
to try to remove

25:25.200 --> 25:27.667
the ability to see
the buttock from the front.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.166
Here. Staple this.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.633
That's it. Close her up

25:35.667 --> 25:37.166
and get her
into recovery, okay?

25:37.200 --> 25:39.133
This is a very difficult
operation.

25:39.166 --> 25:41.533
It's unclear
whether I was able

25:41.567 --> 25:44.133
to completely
remove that portion

25:44.166 --> 25:45.600
that you could see
from the front.

25:45.633 --> 25:48.100
I won't know till tomorrow

25:48.133 --> 25:50.667
whether I actually nailed
that portion of the procedure

25:50.700 --> 25:52.667
or have to do a little
tweaking procedure

25:52.700 --> 25:53.734
postoperatively.

25:55.166 --> 25:57.233
Aw.
Oh, my God. Look at that.

25:57.266 --> 25:59.000
You look a little
like an alien.

25:59.033 --> 26:01.233
I think you're right.
He looks like he,
you know,

26:01.266 --> 26:03.100
"Take me to your leader."

26:04.667 --> 26:06.266
Here's what's left,

26:06.300 --> 26:09.700
and it looks almost
bitten into by a rat.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.500
This is pretty much useless.

26:14.567 --> 26:16.633
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

26:23.767 --> 26:25.033
Hi.
Good morning.

26:25.066 --> 26:27.000
How are you?
Good to see you.

26:27.033 --> 26:28.567
I'm doing fantastic.
How are you doing?

26:28.600 --> 26:30.166
So here's our plan.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.700
You know, those two
little pieces of cartilage

26:32.734 --> 26:34.300
are, like,
sticking right out.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.100
And that's gonna be
our little challenge

26:36.133 --> 26:38.300
of reconstructing
your tip.

26:38.333 --> 26:39.600
Here with Katie,
we're gonna try

26:39.633 --> 26:41.233
to camouflage
the bossa.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.734
So we're gonna use
pericondrium,

26:42.767 --> 26:44.700
which is the covering
on top of the rib.

26:44.734 --> 26:47.000
Once I add that
with some cartilage,

26:47.033 --> 26:48.700
hopefully the two bumps
should go away.

26:48.734 --> 26:50.567
We'll see you later.
All right.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.767
Thanks.
All right.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.066
For Katie's surgery,
my team will start

26:58.100 --> 26:59.667
harvesting rib pericondrium

26:59.700 --> 27:02.033
while I take composite
grafts from her ears.

27:02.066 --> 27:04.200
I'll then open up her nose
and take down the hump

27:04.233 --> 27:06.000
and fracture the nasal bones

27:06.033 --> 27:07.400
to fix her up
and remove deformity.

27:07.433 --> 27:09.300
I'll perform
the turbinoplasty

27:09.333 --> 27:10.734
before inserting
spreader grafts

27:10.767 --> 27:12.633
to give her vault symmetry.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.367
Next, I'll add a septal
extension graft

27:14.400 --> 27:15.600
to lower her nasal tip

27:15.633 --> 27:17.166
and lateral crural struts

27:17.200 --> 27:19.266
to mask the prominent bossa.

27:19.300 --> 27:20.667
Finally, we'll use
composite grafts

27:20.700 --> 27:22.166
to lower her nostrils,

27:22.200 --> 27:24.033
softening Katie's
overall appearance.

27:24.066 --> 27:26.367
We're gonna start with the
right composite graft first.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.567
Suction.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.600
Okay. I'm gonna cut here.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.333
Okay, so this is
the composite graft,

27:33.367 --> 27:36.000
which is a piece
of skin and cartilage.

27:36.033 --> 27:37.300
Okay, the pericondrium's
coming out.

27:37.333 --> 27:39.333
Let's see it. Oh, yeah.

27:39.367 --> 27:42.300
The reason why I like using
pericondrium instead of fascia

27:42.333 --> 27:44.367
is that pericondrium
is a little bit thicker.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.200
It has more bulk.

27:46.233 --> 27:47.400
That's gonna cover better

27:47.433 --> 27:49.066
than something
very thin like fascia.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.166
Our next step,
which will be tricky,

27:51.200 --> 27:52.767
is to dissect off

27:53.000 --> 27:56.633
whatever pieces of cartilage
Kate has from her skin.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.433
And, looking
at her anatomy now,

27:58.467 --> 28:01.100
they just amputated
all of her cartilage.

28:01.133 --> 28:04.100
Even 25 years ago, that
wasn't the right way to go.

28:04.133 --> 28:06.700
You never amputate
nasal cartilage

28:06.734 --> 28:09.066
unless it's absolutely
necessary.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.734
Her surgeon had no clue
what he was doing.

28:10.767 --> 28:12.433
Now let's start
with the fun part,

28:12.467 --> 28:15.066
or trying to make the tip
as symmetric as possible.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.767
So here's what's left,

28:17.000 --> 28:21.166
and it looks almost
bitten into by a rat

28:21.200 --> 28:24.033
because it's, like,
nibbled on both sides.

28:24.066 --> 28:25.333
This is pretty much useless.

28:25.367 --> 28:26.734
So we are gonna be aggressive,

28:26.767 --> 28:28.400
cutting off cartilage
again with--

28:28.433 --> 28:29.767
Ooh!

28:30.000 --> 28:32.333
Removing
Katie's tip cartilage

28:32.367 --> 28:33.667
is scary.
It's not something

28:33.700 --> 28:35.367
I like doing,
removing someone's

28:35.400 --> 28:36.633
own natural cartilage.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.233
But it's not usable,

28:38.266 --> 28:39.300
and there's a lot of scar.

28:39.333 --> 28:41.000
I do want to make sure

28:41.033 --> 28:42.734
that the composigraphs,

28:42.767 --> 28:44.400
which are gonna
lower the nostrils,

28:44.433 --> 28:46.300
are as thin as possible.

28:46.333 --> 28:49.333
I'm cutting back.
Step back. Step back.

28:49.367 --> 28:51.734
Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

28:51.767 --> 28:54.200
When it comes
to nostril symmetry,

28:54.233 --> 28:56.367
it's almost impossible
to achieve.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.667
You're always gonna
have some asymmetry
because sometimes

28:58.700 --> 29:01.233
one side's attached
to the face higher.

29:01.266 --> 29:02.767
But in Katie's situation--

29:03.000 --> 29:05.433
previous scar tissue,
previous surgeries--

29:05.467 --> 29:07.700
means asymmetric nostrils.

29:07.734 --> 29:11.000
So every piece of tissue

29:11.033 --> 29:13.100
and cartilage
that we harvested

29:13.133 --> 29:15.233
is being used inside
of Katie's nose,

29:15.266 --> 29:17.300
and this will be fantastic.

29:17.333 --> 29:19.266

Yeah. I just want to look
like a glamorous me.

32:02.333 --> 32:03.567
So let me ask you.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.166
You know, we--
we have patients come in,

32:06.200 --> 32:08.433
and there's two
varieties of them.

32:08.467 --> 32:10.400
One has complications

32:10.433 --> 32:12.100
that they want
our help with,

32:12.133 --> 32:13.233
and there's another variety

32:13.266 --> 32:14.633
who just wants to go

32:14.667 --> 32:17.066
more, more, more,
and more--
Yeah.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.367
...and blow it up

32:18.400 --> 32:19.400
and become almost
animated characters.

32:19.433 --> 32:20.400
Is that you?

32:20.433 --> 32:22.100
Yeah. I would like

32:22.133 --> 32:23.300
to be an animated
character, so--

32:23.333 --> 32:24.400
You would?

32:24.433 --> 32:25.533
I think that's why

32:25.567 --> 32:27.266
I wear so much makeup.

32:27.300 --> 32:30.333
I just like that
over-the-top kind of look.

32:30.367 --> 32:32.133
You know,
when I wipe it all off,

32:32.166 --> 32:36.300
I just look about 12
and not really sexy anymore.

32:36.333 --> 32:38.300
It's nice to see you
at this stage

32:38.333 --> 32:41.066
before you've gone
to the next level

32:41.100 --> 32:42.266
because, hopefully,

32:42.300 --> 32:44.200
we can give you
some information

32:44.233 --> 32:46.200
that may help you
in what we think

32:46.233 --> 32:47.600
maybe you should
consider not doing.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.367
[chuckling]
Okay.
Okay?

32:50.333 --> 32:52.233
The body is very smart,

32:52.266 --> 32:54.166
and it knows when it
doesn't like something.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.467
And your body
doesn't like that.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.400
It actually makes me
really depressed

32:57.433 --> 32:59.367
to think about it.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.066
The cartilage that
was left in there,

33:01.100 --> 33:02.400
it actually almost
looked like a rat

33:02.433 --> 33:03.600
bit through it.
Oh, God.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.533
I was, like,
completely grossed out.

33:05.567 --> 33:06.600
I was, like, "What?"

33:09.500 --> 33:12.200
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

33:12.233 --> 33:14.467
Okay, first of all,
why don't you point out

33:14.500 --> 33:16.600
these little irregularities
that you're talking about?

33:16.633 --> 33:18.600
Like, a lump.
Quite a big one there.

33:18.633 --> 33:20.266
Well, you've got, like,
a little open wound there.

33:20.300 --> 33:23.100
Yeah.
So is there anything
inside this or no?

33:23.133 --> 33:24.233
A little bit.

33:24.266 --> 33:26.233
Cindy's lips
are getting irritated.

33:26.266 --> 33:27.467
I can see these little
micro-cuts.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.100
That most likely

33:29.133 --> 33:31.400
is from the repeat
injections of filler.

33:31.433 --> 33:32.567
She has to be very careful

33:32.600 --> 33:34.400
because, once
she crosses that line,

33:34.433 --> 33:36.166
she could ruin
her lips completely.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.266
Who does your filler?

33:37.300 --> 33:39.266
A woman from Manchester.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.500
Okay. Is she a nurse or--
No.

33:41.533 --> 33:42.734
Some non-medical
person?

33:42.767 --> 33:45.100
Yeah.
Does she do it

33:45.133 --> 33:46.533
at a facility, or does she
come to your house?

33:46.567 --> 33:48.133
At my house.
Is that legal?

33:48.166 --> 33:49.367
[laughing]

33:49.400 --> 33:51.100
The other question
is what is it?

33:51.133 --> 33:52.233
I can't really go out

33:52.266 --> 33:53.734
and see a doctor
to get my lips done

33:53.767 --> 33:55.266
because
I don't leave my house

33:55.300 --> 33:56.533
without
a full base of makeup,

33:56.567 --> 33:58.600
and that includes
my red lips.

33:58.633 --> 33:59.734
So she's just convenient.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.266
She comes
around to my house,

34:01.300 --> 34:03.533
so it's win-win.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.700
The body is very smart,

34:05.734 --> 34:08.133
and it knows when it
doesn't like something.

34:08.166 --> 34:09.433
And your body
doesn't like that.

34:09.467 --> 34:11.333
You can actually kill the skin

34:11.367 --> 34:12.500
on your upper lip.

34:12.533 --> 34:13.633
You ever
hear the expression

34:13.667 --> 34:15.233
"Don't try this at home"?

34:15.266 --> 34:16.333
that they say
on some TV shows?

34:16.367 --> 34:17.533
Don't do this at home.

34:17.567 --> 34:19.300
But now-- And the problem

34:19.333 --> 34:21.233
with lip implants,

34:21.266 --> 34:24.500
whether they're
made out of something
called PTFE or silicone,

34:24.533 --> 34:26.133
they're never great.

34:26.166 --> 34:28.266
They either move,
or they shrink,

34:28.300 --> 34:31.700
or usually,
even if you put them
in the best place possible,

34:31.734 --> 34:34.400
they start to lift up
and go above the lip.

34:34.433 --> 34:36.367
So the first thing
we're gonna tell you is--

34:36.400 --> 34:39.233
implants-- we're not
gonna recommend for you.

34:39.266 --> 34:41.200
It actually makes me
really depressed

34:41.233 --> 34:42.600
to think about it.

34:42.633 --> 34:44.567
Okay, let's talk
about your breasts, okay?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.567
First of all, I'm curious

34:46.600 --> 34:48.266
whether you're
on top of the muscle

34:48.300 --> 34:49.433
or under the muscle,

34:49.467 --> 34:52.667
so put your hands here
and push down. Flex.

34:52.700 --> 34:54.433
Yeah, you're-- you're
on top of the muscle.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.633
Okay. For sure.

34:55.667 --> 34:57.200
And then, secondly,

34:57.233 --> 35:00.433
your breast implants
are up here,

35:00.467 --> 35:03.600
and your breast tissue
is essentially hanging
off them.

35:03.633 --> 35:06.300
You have what we call
classic dissociation.

35:06.333 --> 35:09.300
So the procedure
to correct that

35:09.333 --> 35:10.467
is a breast lift.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.266
If you put
a giant implant in there,

35:13.300 --> 35:15.200
it won't work.

35:15.233 --> 35:18.467
It only works if you have
a little bit of droopiness.

35:18.500 --> 35:22.166
Then it's like putting
a big foot in a small sock,

35:22.200 --> 35:24.500
and it will fill up
the smaller sock.

35:24.533 --> 35:27.600
Your sock is too big
and too droopy.

35:27.633 --> 35:30.667
I don't care how big a foot
you put in there.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.734
It's always gonna be
a droopy sock.

35:32.767 --> 35:34.600
Trust me on this.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.500
I can do a lift for you,

35:36.533 --> 35:37.734
but in fact it would
probably be better

35:37.767 --> 35:39.367
if you went a little smaller.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.633
I don't want to go smaller.

35:40.667 --> 35:42.000
I want to go bigger,

35:42.033 --> 35:44.400
so no,
it's definitely something

35:44.433 --> 35:46.000
that I definitely
wouldn't consider.

35:46.033 --> 35:48.467
Any large increases
in size,

35:48.500 --> 35:51.367
any tight lifts can
risk losing the nipple,

35:51.400 --> 35:54.500
losing sensation,
losing your breast.

35:54.533 --> 35:56.567
It's just a disaster
'cause I have news for you.

35:56.600 --> 36:00.333
Bigger is not always better.

36:00.367 --> 36:02.467
If there any way
we can convince you

36:02.500 --> 36:05.500
just to not do all
this gigantic surgery

36:05.533 --> 36:07.400
that you might be
planning on doing?

36:07.433 --> 36:08.667
I love big boobs,

36:08.700 --> 36:10.333
and to have them smaller

36:10.367 --> 36:12.300
just-- I wouldn't
be the same.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.266
Sometimes the best
plastic surgery

36:14.300 --> 36:15.767
is no plastic
surgery at all.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.533
And if Cindy continues
expanding her size,

36:19.567 --> 36:24.233
she is going to meet
a major surgical disaster,

36:24.266 --> 36:26.467
and there may be no
going back from that.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.367
Well, can I take
some, uh,

36:28.400 --> 36:29.767
chicken fillets--

36:30.000 --> 36:31.633
[laughing]
Yes.
...to stuff in my bra?

36:31.667 --> 36:33.333
If we can prevent you

36:33.367 --> 36:34.667
from having
any of the surgery

36:34.700 --> 36:36.266
by giving you
some of those--
Yeah. Give me--

36:36.300 --> 36:38.467
...we'll give you
the whole chicken coop.

36:42.066 --> 36:43.467
[Katie's mother]
Good morning.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.033
How are you, Mom?
I'm good. How are you?

36:45.066 --> 36:46.533
Hi.
How are you, young lady?

36:46.567 --> 36:49.333
I didn't get much sleep
last night because

36:49.367 --> 36:50.667
I've been so congested,

36:50.700 --> 36:52.400
but I don't feel as bad

36:52.433 --> 36:54.400
as I thought I was
gonna actually feel.

36:54.433 --> 36:55.533
Turn back for me.

36:55.567 --> 36:56.767
You have the splints in.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Can you breathe at all?

36:58.033 --> 36:59.467
No.
Okay.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.000
Skin of the nose
looks good.

37:01.033 --> 37:02.066
Okay.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.600
At first glance,

37:03.633 --> 37:04.767
now only is Katie
in good spirits,

37:05.000 --> 37:06.600
but her nose, ear, and rib

37:06.633 --> 37:08.400
look fine.

37:08.433 --> 37:09.533
I am thrilled.

37:09.567 --> 37:11.667
You're gonna have
a cuter profile.

37:11.700 --> 37:14.066
And your tip here,

37:14.100 --> 37:15.667
this is gonna be
a lot better.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.400
However, this is gonna be
very swollen for a while.

37:18.433 --> 37:20.367
Interesting part about it

37:20.400 --> 37:22.667
is the cartilage
that was left in there.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.266
It actually almost looked
like a rat bit through it.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.667
God.
The reason why--

37:26.700 --> 37:28.033
it was very thin,

37:28.066 --> 37:29.700
but it was jagged
on both ends.

37:29.734 --> 37:31.667
I was, like,
completely grossed out.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.033
I was like, "What?"

37:33.066 --> 37:34.567
I really hope he was
able to get in there

37:34.600 --> 37:36.700
and actually make it
look normal inside.

37:36.734 --> 37:38.633
So the cartilage that
goes all the way here,

37:38.667 --> 37:40.100
removed it.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.000
We used pieces of rib
to reconstruct it.

37:42.033 --> 37:44.767
Okay.
So you have a complete
brand-new nose.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.400
Yeah.
[chuckles]

37:46.433 --> 37:47.467
I'll see you next week.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.533
Thank you so much.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.734
Thank you.
Pleasure.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.133
Today I'm gonna
be showcasing

37:53.166 --> 37:54.567
some of my artwork.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.767
I haven't
showcased my artwork

37:56.000 --> 37:57.533
in about 25 years.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.100
But what's even more
exciting for me

37:59.133 --> 38:01.100
is that I get to showcase
a new self-portrait

38:01.133 --> 38:02.700
with my new
and approved nose.

38:02.734 --> 38:03.767
There's you.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.100
Yep.
Contemplating.

38:05.133 --> 38:07.700
Oh, right.
I remember that sofa.

38:07.734 --> 38:09.433
I'm looking at all
these portraits here,

38:09.467 --> 38:11.633
seeing all the family
members and friends.

38:11.667 --> 38:13.400
But you don't see
Katie's face.

38:13.433 --> 38:15.734
[Katie]
Dr. Nassif is a true
artist as well

38:15.767 --> 38:17.567
because, since
having the surgery,

38:17.600 --> 38:18.767
I feel like me again.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.033
Katie!

38:20.066 --> 38:21.767
[cheering]

38:25.066 --> 38:26.600
Oh, good to see you.

38:26.633 --> 38:28.367
I've wanted
to have my nose fixed

38:28.400 --> 38:29.734
for over 20 years now,

38:29.767 --> 38:32.033
and even though I was
so scared and terrified,

38:32.066 --> 38:35.400
I just feel so glad
that I went through

38:35.433 --> 38:36.500
with this whole process.

38:36.533 --> 38:39.066
And there I am.
[cheering]

38:39.100 --> 38:41.000
Wow.
See the side?

38:41.033 --> 38:42.567
Smooth nose, no bumps.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.066
[laughing]

38:44.100 --> 38:45.467
I'm just so proud of you

38:45.500 --> 38:47.467
that you were able
to paint that painting.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.500
I love it.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.400
Aw. Thanks, Mama.

38:50.433 --> 38:53.000
[Sandy]
I feel the weight
taken off of my shoulders

38:53.033 --> 38:54.767
of the poor decision
that I made,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.433
and I'm just so happy

38:56.467 --> 38:58.367
that Katie's comfortable
with who she is now.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.500
She can walk proudly

38:59.533 --> 39:01.000
and just enjoy life.

39:01.033 --> 39:02.633
I want to make a toast.

39:02.667 --> 39:04.734
The old has gone,
the new has come,

39:04.767 --> 39:06.200
and that deserved
a celebration.

39:06.233 --> 39:07.500
Absolutely.

39:07.533 --> 39:09.200
Before my surgery
with my nose,

39:09.233 --> 39:11.400
it was pinched in.
There was a crease

39:11.433 --> 39:12.633
that went down the center.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.133
There was the bumps
on each side.

39:14.166 --> 39:15.633
It was also
a constant reminder

39:15.667 --> 39:17.133
of the snap decision

39:17.166 --> 39:18.734
that my mother had
to make under pressure.

39:18.767 --> 39:20.433
Now, thanks to Dr. Nassif,

39:20.467 --> 39:22.033
my mother's guilt
has been lifted.

39:22.066 --> 39:23.367
My nostrils are lower.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.367
My bossa are removed
from my nose,

39:25.400 --> 39:26.667
and the crease
is gone as well.

39:26.700 --> 39:27.700
Definitely something
to celebrate.

39:27.734 --> 39:28.767
Yes, it is.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.166
And that tastes darn good.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.166
[laughter]

39:31.200 --> 39:32.367
Boom.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.433
Only thing

39:34.467 --> 39:35.667
that is scaring me
at this point

39:35.700 --> 39:36.700
is obviously the front.

39:36.734 --> 39:38.000
I'm a little nervous

39:38.033 --> 39:39.066
for Tomi
to see her butt take,

39:39.100 --> 39:40.200
'cause I know Tomi,

39:40.233 --> 39:41.567
and I know how hard
she is to please.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.700
Let's see what's cooking.

39:45.533 --> 39:48.233
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

39:48.266 --> 39:50.767
[Dubrow]
I'd planned for about
a three-hour surgery.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.433
It took me five
and a half hours.

39:52.467 --> 39:55.567
It was a very
difficult surgery.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.166
So I made an incision,

39:57.200 --> 39:58.700
and it was just
silicone everywhere,

39:58.734 --> 40:00.100
both free-floating

40:00.133 --> 40:01.767
and in little
silicone balls.
No way.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.433
There was actually
a silicone ball

40:03.467 --> 40:06.166
where I grabbed it
and squeezed it. Pssh!

40:06.200 --> 40:08.467
Stop. Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.467
So I removed
a giant segment

40:11.500 --> 40:13.166
of that silicone-containing
tissue,

40:13.200 --> 40:14.567
and then I lifted you up.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.100
I'm so happy and relieved

40:16.133 --> 40:17.533
that he got
more silicone out.

40:17.567 --> 40:19.266
I mean, that's really
what I wanted.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.266
I want it all out,
if I could.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.767
Then I had to deal
with the lower part.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.033
I wasn't too, too, too
aggressive about that

40:27.066 --> 40:28.700
because I can't tell you
how many times

40:28.734 --> 40:30.633
I've seen surgeons
lose their way

40:30.667 --> 40:32.233
because the patient's
lying down.

40:32.266 --> 40:33.667
You lose the architecture,

40:33.700 --> 40:35.300
and they go
over to the front

40:35.333 --> 40:37.100
in places they shouldn't be.

40:37.133 --> 40:38.533
So let's see what's cooking.

40:38.567 --> 40:40.233
I'm a little nervous
for Tomi

40:40.266 --> 40:42.033
to see her butt take,
'cause I know Tomi,

40:42.066 --> 40:43.567
and I know how hard
she is to please.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.200
Okay, so first thing,
I just have to know.

40:46.233 --> 40:47.567
Did I get rid of that?

40:47.600 --> 40:49.266
I think I did.
I think it's swollen,

40:49.300 --> 40:52.066
but I think did.
But turn around and face me.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.233
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:54.266 --> 40:56.300
It's hard to tell because
it's gonna be very swollen.

40:56.333 --> 40:57.700
And if it's still there,

40:57.734 --> 41:00.133
a little teeny
little tweak, gone.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.667
If that's still there,

41:01.700 --> 41:03.767
I definitely want
Dr. Dubrow to do that

41:04.000 --> 41:05.700
little tweak thing
that he's talking about

41:05.734 --> 41:08.633
because I don't want to have
those balls anymore.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.166
Only thing that is
scaring me at this point

41:11.200 --> 41:12.500
is obviously the front.

41:12.533 --> 41:14.000
If we do have to
tweak that area,

41:14.033 --> 41:16.300
it's what we call
in surgery a ditzel.

41:16.333 --> 41:20.066
A ditzel is a very small
surgical procedure.

41:20.100 --> 41:21.533
It's a very small thing.

41:21.567 --> 41:24.166
That's a ditzel.
This is a ditzel.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.667
I think we're
pretty much done here.

41:26.700 --> 41:27.667
Thank you so much.

41:30.333 --> 41:33.233
I've wanted to marry Kyle
for six years.

41:33.266 --> 41:34.767
I didn't know
this day would ever come.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.734
I feel like I have
my life back.

41:36.767 --> 41:39.700
I'm able to finally move on
from my past now.

41:39.734 --> 41:42.600
And on top of that,
I have a normal-looking butt.

41:42.633 --> 41:45.200
[Kyle]
What the doctors
have done for Tomi

41:45.233 --> 41:47.100
has changed our lives
dramatically.

41:47.133 --> 41:49.100
It was hard for her
to ever be happy before,

41:49.133 --> 41:51.333
and she's excited and happy
about life now,

41:51.367 --> 41:53.266
and we're
excited to move forward.

41:53.300 --> 41:55.000
I think Kyle's
gonna be blown away

41:55.033 --> 41:56.567
to see me like this.
I feel the way

41:56.600 --> 41:58.300
you're supposed to feel
in a wedding dress.

41:58.333 --> 42:00.633
I feel happy and sexy
and confident.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.233
Tomi, Kyle,

42:06.266 --> 42:09.266
you know, you two have been
through a lot together already.

42:09.300 --> 42:11.367
Kyle's stuck by my side
this whole time

42:11.400 --> 42:14.133
with the surgeries
and the hospital visits

42:14.166 --> 42:15.266
and all of that,

42:15.300 --> 42:16.533
and I'm just happy

42:16.567 --> 42:18.200
and excited for the future.

42:18.233 --> 42:19.367
I look forward

42:19.400 --> 42:21.734
to spending the rest
of my life with you,

42:21.767 --> 42:25.100
and I'm gonna continue
to take care of myself

42:25.133 --> 42:27.734
and just be the healthiest
person that I can be

42:27.767 --> 42:29.633
so I can be around

42:29.667 --> 42:31.233
and be here for you.

42:31.266 --> 42:32.734
My kidney function has

42:32.767 --> 42:34.767
totally improved
since seeing Dr. Dubrow.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.100
So just
for that reason alone,

42:37.133 --> 42:38.300
I'm totally happy.

42:38.333 --> 42:40.300
Do you, Tomi, take Kyle

42:40.333 --> 42:43.567
to love, hold, and support
in sickness and in health?

42:43.600 --> 42:44.667
I do.

42:44.700 --> 42:46.100
Before my surgery,

42:46.133 --> 42:47.300
you could see my butt
from the front.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.266
I had to wear multiple layers

42:49.300 --> 42:51.300
to cover scarring
and silicone bulges,

42:51.333 --> 42:53.400
and it made me
regret my decisions.

42:53.433 --> 42:55.233
But now,
thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

42:55.266 --> 42:57.100
it no longer looks
like I have balls,

42:57.133 --> 42:59.200
and I have a better shape
than I could ask for.

42:59.233 --> 43:02.066
This is definitely
the happiest day of my life.

43:02.100 --> 43:04.100
I declare you
husband and wife.

43:04.133 --> 43:05.266
You may kiss the bride.

43:09.066 --> 43:13.200
I have spent
over $450,000 on surgery.

43:13.233 --> 43:15.300
You're about to go
down to that place

43:15.333 --> 43:17.600
where you could
turn into a disaster.

43:17.633 --> 43:19.367
When I see my breasts now,

43:19.400 --> 43:21.734
it's gut-wrenching.
They're so deformed.

43:21.767 --> 43:23.333
When I woke up
from anesthesia,

43:23.367 --> 43:27.100
the nurse said, "Surprise."
And my jaw dropped.

43:27.133 --> 43:28.667
I had a doctor
look at me and go,

43:28.700 --> 43:30.600
"A surgeon
actually did that."

43:30.633 --> 43:32.734
My body looks
like Frankenstein.

43:32.767 --> 43:34.667
[Dubrow]
That skin could all
die on us.

43:34.700 --> 43:36.033
[bleep]

43:36.066 --> 43:37.734
Is this gonna be
a disaster?
