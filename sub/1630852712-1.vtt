WEBVTT

00:14.480 --> 00:17.360
Which ones, roses or daisies?

00:31.280 --> 00:32.840
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

00:35.720 --> 00:39.120
That's enough, Betty.
Yes, thank you.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.440
Lovely colour.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.120
THEY LAUGH

01:00.800 --> 01:03.080
Wow! Look how beautiful it is
over there!

LIVELY CHATTER

TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

01:29.040 --> 01:31.480
Do be careful not to get
smuts on your dress, Rose.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.600
Attenzione, prego!

01:50.680 --> 01:51.800
Scusi.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.800
Hotel Portofino?
Good. Our luggage.

01:59.800 --> 02:05.000
Nostri bagagli.
We have eight cases. Otto?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.160
Mrs Drummond-Ward?
Si, Signora.

02:08.160 --> 02:12.400
Marvellous. Let's try
not to lose any of them, shall we?

02:12.400 --> 02:16.080
Come along, Rose.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.560
Do try and keep up, darling.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.040
They're one of the oldest families
in the county.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.160
I've known Cecil since I was a girl.
And what about Mrs Ainsworth?

02:34.160 --> 02:38.080
Oh, she's quite a different sort.
A different sort?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.600
Don't be dim, Rose.
You know exactly what I mean.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.960
Not sure I do, Mama.
Well...

02:42.960 --> 02:46.080
she is the sort of woman who thinks
nothing of opening an hotel,

02:46.080 --> 02:50.440
for one thing. God knows what
poor Cecil must make of it all.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.640
Grazie.
Prego.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.000
Andiamo.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.280
Betty, I have come to see
how you're getting on.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.080
I'm making do, Mrs Mays-Smith.
Making do.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.440
Well, this is not like any
cut of meat I've ever cooked before.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.360
It's beef.
Yes, it's beef all right.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.880
Italian beef.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.960
And is there a problem
with the Italian beef, Betty?

03:44.960 --> 03:46.920
Well, there's not much fat in it,
ma'am.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.600
Means I won't have any dripping
for me puddings. Or the potatoes.

03:50.600 --> 03:55.600
Oh, yes, potatoes. These waxy
little bullet-type things

03:55.600 --> 03:57.600
that are not like
proper spuds at all.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.960
Well, you'll just have to manage.
I'll do my best, ma'am.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.920
Please make sure you do.
My mother is very keen

04:03.920 --> 04:06.400
we make a good first impression
on the new arrivals.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.600
To make everything feel like a...
CLATTER

04:13.560 --> 04:15.120
..a home from home.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.960
BELL DINGS

04:42.480 --> 04:46.440
They could arrive any time, Billy.
Yes, Mrs Ainsworth.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.880
Remember... first impressions.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.040
First impressions. Yes, ma'am.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.120
Nuovi arrivi?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.360
Una fresca consegna di rose Inglese.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.360
Billy, go get the suitcases.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.720
Grazie.

05:31.720 --> 05:36.440
Mrs Drummond-Ward, Rose. Welcome.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.720
Mrs... Ainsworth?

05:37.720 --> 05:41.960
Yes, but please call me Bella.
I do hope I can call you Julia.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.360
How was your journey?

05:46.360 --> 05:48.960
Long. And exceedingly tiresome.

05:48.960 --> 05:53.160
Well, we must do our best to make it
all seem worth your while.

05:53.160 --> 05:58.080
Welcome to the Hotel Portofino.
How utterly charming.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.720
Lucian, I do hope you looked after
our guests

06:00.720 --> 06:02.960
on the way from the train station.
Darling?

06:02.960 --> 06:05.080
Lucian...
You're Lucian?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.560
Why didn't you say something?

06:08.560 --> 06:10.680
Well,
the moment never seemed to arise.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.920
How very irregular.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.840
Oh, darling!
What?

06:19.840 --> 06:21.840
What are you doing?
It was a joke!

06:53.640 --> 06:55.760
CHATTER BELOW

06:59.200 --> 07:01.280
Melissa?

07:03.520 --> 07:05.000
Melissa!

07:09.640 --> 07:11.520
Yes, Aunt.
What's that dreadful racket?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.120
I believe some guests are arriving.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.360
Oh, I knew
we should have rented a villa.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.000
I very much doubt it would have
been as comfortable as this.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.880
A lot more private, perhaps.
How are you feeling, Aunt?

07:22.880 --> 07:24.160
Simply ghastly.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.440
Shall I let them know
that you won't be down for dinner?

07:26.440 --> 07:29.680
Goodness, no.
One has to keep one's strength up.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.200
BUSY MARKET CHATTER

08:17.640 --> 08:20.440
Look at how dear and delightful
everything is.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.920
Do you think Mrs Ainsworth
does it all herself?

08:24.920 --> 08:27.640
I'm sure she enjoys
getting her hands dirty.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.800
Let's take a look at you.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.440
Well, I suppose you'll have to do.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.680
Remember, Rose, first impressions.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.040
Hello. Oh, Champagne. How lovely.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.680
It's Prosecco.
Lighter and fruitier than Champagne.

08:58.680 --> 09:02.160
From a local vineyard.
How did you find your room?

09:02.160 --> 09:04.360
Somewhat smaller than we're used to.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.120
But so exquisitely decorated.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.280
We were wondering
if you did it all yourself.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.040
Thank you.
Weren't we, Mama?

09:12.040 --> 09:16.240
Well, I do hope that
all of our guests are as observant

09:16.240 --> 09:19.600
and sweet as you, Rose.
Are we amongst your first?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.160
We've been open since Easter,

09:21.160 --> 09:24.160
but it's only in the last month
or so that we've got busy.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.520
How many times do I have
to tell you? I don't drink alcohol.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.000
I am very sorry, Lady Latchmere.
It won't happen again.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.440
It's deeply irritating.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.320
Is there anything else
I can get you?  No.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.760
Buonasera.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.840
And that is...?

09:41.840 --> 09:44.880
Oh, Count Albani and his son,
Roberto.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.520
I shall introduce you.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.640
I understood that all the guests
were to be English.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.200
Your advertisement
was quite specific.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.320
"A very English Hotel
on the Italian Riviera."

09:54.320 --> 09:57.960
Yes, quite.
English or... English speaking.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.880
Count Albani is an Oxford man.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.920
And what about that gentleman?
Ah, Mr Sengupta.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.880
Yes, he's a dear friend of my son's.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.880
Afternoon.
It's evening.

10:08.880 --> 10:12.440
Speak of the devil. Lucian, perhaps
you'd like to redeem yourself

10:12.440 --> 10:15.240
to Mrs Drummond-Ward and to Rose.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.160
You could tell them
all about Portofino.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.640
Hmm? Erm... Ooh, I hardly know
where to start.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.280
Will you excuse me?

10:22.280 --> 10:24.920
Well, then...
start from the beginning.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.160
How does an English family
come to be here in the first place?

10:28.160 --> 10:30.560
Oh, well, that one's easy.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.560
Mother really rather
fell in love with the place

10:32.560 --> 10:36.040
when she was on her honeymoon
with Father.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.760
But what made her
decide to move here?

10:37.760 --> 10:41.960
I think she thought we would all
benefit from... a fresh start.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.400
A new adventure. After the war.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.440
For Alice, for Lottie, for myself.
Even for Father.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.800
And will Cecil be gracing us
with his presence this evening?

10:55.800 --> 11:01.080
Erm, I'm afraid my father
sends his most sincere apologies.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.280
He has been unavoidably delayed.

11:14.360 --> 11:20.200

LIVELY CHATTER

11:25.760 --> 11:27.480
Grazie.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.560
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER CONTINUE

11:29.560 --> 11:32.480
The main course.
Thank you.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.640
CHATTER CONTINUES

11:41.320 --> 11:44.800
May I have some salt, please?
That's enough.

11:49.040 --> 11:53.280
Billy, when you have a moment,
can we have another?

11:56.080 --> 12:00.720
Oh, Billy. Thank you so much.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.040
Well done.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.960
Take it off. It's sweltering.

12:13.880 --> 12:18.400
I'm ready. Come on!
See you out there.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.920
Come on! Get in!
The water is beautiful!

12:37.120 --> 12:42.000
Darling, you were an absolute
trooper tonight, thank you so much.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.480
Oh, botheration!
What is it?

12:43.480 --> 12:46.440
Another stain.
Don't worry, I can fix that.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.480
I think it went about as well
as can be expected.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.120
Dinner?
No, the introduction to Rose.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.160
Oh.
She's very pretty, isn't she?

12:56.160 --> 12:58.840
Not that it matters.
No, no. Of course, of course not.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.640
It's character that counts, but...

13:00.640 --> 13:04.160
Her father's 6,000 acres
of prime arable land is what counts.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.640
Don't be so cynical!
You know it's true.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.960
She could look like
the back end of an omnibus

13:08.960 --> 13:11.440
and Father would still be keen
for Lucian to marry her.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.040
Alice!

13:15.520 --> 13:18.560
You know, I don't think
Father would spend

13:18.560 --> 13:21.880
one tenth of the amount of time
trying to find me a new husband.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.280
And you know I'm right.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.400
Take it off, it's soaking.
So?

13:41.400 --> 13:44.800
I'm not going to catch a cold.
Don't be such a baby!

13:44.800 --> 13:47.360
I've seen it before,
hundreds of times.

13:47.360 --> 13:52.320
Lucian, I'm serious, take it off.
I'd like to see how it's healing.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.360
YELLING, PANTING

14:23.720 --> 14:27.440
What's the prognosis?
Just a scratch.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.440
Does it ever bother you?

14:33.080 --> 14:36.880
Hardly at all.
It has been eight years.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.320
Italy suits you.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.320
Betty, you are still here.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.240
I were just going, Mrs Ainsworth.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.360
Can I get you something, ma'am?
Perhaps I'll have a fresh mint tea.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.760
Oh, no, no, no.
I can manage, honestly.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.480
And thank you for dinner.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.560
Oh,
Count Albani sends his compliments.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.200
Oh! Did he just?

15:20.200 --> 15:23.160
Particularly for the potatoes.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.800
Oh! Well, I never!

15:25.800 --> 15:29.920
I told you,
this is such marvellous stuff.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.040
Olive oil.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.040
I've been greasing
the pans with it, ma'am.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.680
Waste not, want not.
THEY CHUCKLE

15:38.680 --> 15:41.000
Night-night.
Night.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.880
Oh, olive oil! Whatever next?

16:08.160 --> 16:11.000
So, what do you think?
What do I think about what?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.480
Of the girl, you ass.

16:13.480 --> 16:18.440
First impressions?
She's a bit of a peach.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.400
Do you really think so?
Absolutely.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.000
Although it was hard to tell
from five yards away

16:23.000 --> 16:25.080
and with you drooling all over her.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.000
THEY LAUGH

16:33.680 --> 16:35.320
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.280
Mm.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.280
Well...

16:41.680 --> 16:43.240
..nothing's decided yet.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.200
KNOCKING

17:08.360 --> 17:12.360
Posso aiutarvi?
It's Constance March, ma'am.

17:12.360 --> 17:16.000
The new nanny.
Oh! Come in, come in!

17:16.000 --> 17:19.360
How on earth did you get here?

17:19.360 --> 17:23.120
I walked, ma'am. I got a lift
on a cart for the last mile or so.

17:23.120 --> 17:28.120
Oh, for goodness sake.
Why didn't you telegram, dear child?

17:28.120 --> 17:30.400
Let us know you were coming.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.160
I didn't want to waste the money,
Mrs Ainsworth.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.640
We would've reimbursed you.
Are... Are you hungry?

17:36.640 --> 17:39.800
I can manage until breakfast, ma'am.
Very well.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.480
Let's get you to bed, then.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.760
And we can acquaint ourselves
properly in the morning.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.720
Let me help you,
I'll show you your room.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.720
It's slightly makeshift
at the moment,

17:47.720 --> 17:49.640
but hopefully it will suffice.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.040
I'll, erm...
I'll say good night here.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.320
Aren't you coming up?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.360
No, I'm going to take a turn
around the garden.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.200
Do you want me to come with you?
No, you go ahead.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.960
KNOCKING

19:41.720 --> 19:45.400
"My darling Bella,
how your last letter thrilled me.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.880
"I do so wish I could be with you,

19:47.880 --> 19:51.280
"to experience
all that Italy can bring.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.000
"The beauty of that blessed country

19:53.000 --> 19:55.920
"is surpassed
only by your loveliness.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.360
"I yearn to see..."
KNOCKING

20:00.560 --> 20:03.720
You're late.
The train was delayed.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.000
Ah. How was Genoa?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.640
You know, Genoa was Genoa.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.200
Mm-hm.

20:12.200 --> 20:16.160
So... How was it?

20:16.160 --> 20:18.880
Ah... I think Julia
was rather disappointed

20:18.880 --> 20:23.200
you weren't here to greet her.
And Alice's nose is out of joint.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.760
But apart from that,
I think it went rather well.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.960
And the girl?
Rose is charming.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.280
Yes, yes, yes, but is she pretty?
Will he go for her?

20:31.280 --> 20:36.080
She's beautiful, but as you know,
looks are only a part of it.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.000
But they, er...
they help sugar the pill.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.680
Come along.
Let's get you to bed, you're drunk.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.080
MUFFLED SHOUTING

21:45.000 --> 21:47.640
MOANING

22:04.600 --> 22:06.520
Oh, the agony!

22:14.760 --> 22:16.080
Oh, Nish.
Mrs Ainsworth?

22:16.080 --> 22:20.040
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Not at all. How may I assist you?

22:20.040 --> 22:23.120
Lady Latchmere's been taken ill.
And I was rather hoping...

22:23.120 --> 22:26.640
Ah. I'm a little out of practice,
I'm afraid,

22:26.640 --> 22:31.480
and somewhat ill-equipped.
LATCHMERE MOANS

22:31.480 --> 22:35.600
Please, Nish. It's just if anything
should happen to Her Ladyship...

22:35.600 --> 22:37.680
Give me a moment.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.240
Oh, thank you. I'm so sorry to ask.
It's all right.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.880
Hello.  Mr Sengupta has agreed
to attend to Her Ladyship.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.360
Someone help me!
Bella...

22:48.360 --> 22:50.520
LATCHMERE GASPS
He's medically trained.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.880
Are you sure?
Yes, she's in very good hands.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.360
Would you like a cup of tea?
Or something a little stronger?

23:01.360 --> 23:04.760
Yes, please.
Come along.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.720
Have you been in there all night?

23:38.720 --> 23:40.760
I told Miss De Vere
I'd make myself comfortable

23:40.760 --> 23:42.760
in case her aunt took ill again.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.800
Do you think I should call
a local doctor?

23:44.800 --> 23:47.760
I think not. I've relieved
her immediate symptoms,

23:47.760 --> 23:51.760
although you might... um...

23:51.760 --> 23:53.960
serve prunes for breakfast.

23:53.960 --> 23:57.040
Ah.
And may I suggest a digestif

23:57.040 --> 24:00.960
for Her Ladyship, after every meal.
Did you have anything in mind?

24:02.720 --> 24:05.960
Perhaps a little of that excellent
Limoncello you served last night.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.720
You do know Lady Latchmere
doesn't drink alcohol.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.040
Then tell her it's Italian lemonade.
Right.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.360
Nish...

24:15.360 --> 24:18.280
How...
How do you find Lucian?

24:22.760 --> 24:25.000
Like he's finally starting to heal.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.200
Physically, at least.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.000
And otherwise?

24:31.440 --> 24:36.280
What he went through...
it will always cast its shadow.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.680
Yes, yes, of course.

24:41.760 --> 24:47.640
It's just...
he used to be so full of plans

24:47.640 --> 24:52.560
and schemes and...
a sense of purpose, and now...

24:53.600 --> 24:55.040
He will be again.

24:57.480 --> 24:58.840
Give him time.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.560
Thank you.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.960
Constance?
Mrs Scanlon.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.680
Oh, let me look at you!

25:47.960 --> 25:50.600
What a sight for sore eyes!

25:51.840 --> 25:54.720
I can't quite believe I'm here.
When did you get in?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.800
A little after midnight.
And you're up at the crack of dawn.

25:59.240 --> 26:02.800
I could barely sleep.
It can have that effect on you.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.400
Though if you ask me, Whitby's
just as handsome. In its own way.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.920
Oh, these are for you.
Oh, bless you!

26:09.920 --> 26:13.560
Marmalade.
And proper English mustard.

26:13.560 --> 26:19.360
And... this is from my mam.
Ah. Bless you, love.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.320
Who'd have thought it...

26:24.320 --> 26:27.280
When me and Fanny Gray
were girls in service together,

26:27.280 --> 26:31.240
that I'd be standing here,
nearly 30 years later,

26:31.240 --> 26:34.080
with her daughter.

26:34.080 --> 26:37.040
In Italy, of all places!

26:39.800 --> 26:45.120
Oh, come here. Come, come here.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.520
Hello.
Hello.

27:25.320 --> 27:29.040
Who's Henry Bowater Esquire?

27:29.040 --> 27:31.480
He's one of my father's accountants.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.640
Not from the textile factory?

27:33.640 --> 27:36.760
From his private estate.
Oh.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.840
I'm writing to him
about our cash flow.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.480
Ah.
Mm.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.000
Well, I thought I might
saunter into town later.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.160
Do you want me to post anything?
I'll find you when I've finished.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.320
Good, good.
Cecil.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.640
Hmm?

27:52.640 --> 27:54.080
I know what you did.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.400
Then you're one up on me.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.200
It's bad enough
that you took the money,

28:03.200 --> 28:06.240
but please don't lie to me as well.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.280
HE SIGHS

28:08.280 --> 28:11.440
I was going to tell you.
Really? When?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.880
When I had the means
to pay you back!

28:13.880 --> 28:17.040
But you do. What about the money
from your family trust?

28:20.320 --> 28:22.120
I've spent every last sou,
I'm afraid.

28:22.120 --> 28:27.680
What?! Cecil,
I cannot run this hotel on credit!

28:27.680 --> 28:29.880
I need all the ready money
I can get!

28:29.880 --> 28:34.280
Me too, sweetheart. Me too.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.280
CHILDREN LAUGHING
Lucian!

28:44.280 --> 28:47.520
Why... me? Hmm? Hmm?

28:47.520 --> 28:50.520
Of course,
Lottie will be your priority,

28:50.520 --> 28:53.080
but there will be other duties
as well, I'm afraid.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.960
I understand, ma'am.
Helping Betty in the kitchen.

28:55.960 --> 28:59.080
A little bit of cleaning, if
needed. We'll need you to muck in.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.520
I'll be happy to turn my hand
to anything, Mrs Ainsworth.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.040
Oh, that makes me
very happy to hear.

29:04.040 --> 29:07.680
Perhaps you could start by taking
these to the dining room.

29:07.680 --> 29:11.600
And be sure to answer any questions
the guests might have.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.640
Oh. You can read and write, child?

29:13.640 --> 29:16.000
I get by, ma'am.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.240
Yes. We'll have to do
a bit better than get by. Um...

29:19.240 --> 29:21.760
Alice!
Mother.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.560
This is Constance March.
The new nanny.

29:24.560 --> 29:28.560
This is Mrs Mays-Smith,
my daughter and Lottie's mother.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.880
Might now be a good moment
for her to meet Lottie?

29:31.880 --> 29:33.760
No time like the present.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.360
Marvellous.
Come along.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.800
Paola!
Signora.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.920
Faresti una commissione per me?

29:46.920 --> 29:49.000
Certamente.
Grazie.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.880
Dove vai?
Vado a imbucare una lettera.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.560
Dammi.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.400
Good morning.
Good morning.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.360
Have you breakfasted?
We're just on our way.

30:21.360 --> 30:25.600
And how did you sleep?
Adequately. It was hot.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.760
And the room was somewhat cramped,
I'm afraid.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.920
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well, I slept like a baby.

30:30.920 --> 30:34.840
It was much more like a wonderful
country house than a hotel.

30:34.840 --> 30:38.320
Do you know, that's exactly
what it was before we converted it.

30:38.320 --> 30:42.920
Oh. Has it taken you long?
Three years in September.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.800
In addition to the other three
that it took

30:44.800 --> 30:47.760
to persuade my husband
to come here in the first place.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.920
I was wondering if you had
something more spacious.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.720
And on the first floor.
Ah.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.760
Unfortunately, we're fully booked.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.240
Maybe I should speak with Cecil
about it.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.760
Well, perhaps I could move
one of the other guests.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.440
Marvellous.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.360
Come along, Rose.

31:09.640 --> 31:13.800
TALKING QUIETLY

31:13.800 --> 31:15.720
I hope it'll make you feel
much better.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.360
I'm still feeling frightful.

31:36.360 --> 31:40.400
Do you want some more?
Yes! Very nice.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.240
Thank you so much.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.600
There you are.
Here I am.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.120
Well, what a pretty view.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.800
I thought perhaps that we might
take a trip down to the beach.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.920
It's much cooler in the afternoon.

32:07.920 --> 32:11.240
Or if you prefer,
we could have a boat trip.

32:11.240 --> 32:12.880
You do know how to swim?

32:14.840 --> 32:16.520
I'm not sure I do.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.760
Well, in that case,
it'll be my pleasure to teach you.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.080
I should see what Mama says.

32:28.800 --> 32:32.920
They make a fine couple.
As much as we did at their age.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.080
HE CHUCKLES

32:37.320 --> 32:39.920
Have you been avoiding me?
As if I could.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.680
Or would.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.120
Has he been
making himself agreeable?

32:50.120 --> 32:53.520
Let's just say we didn't get off
to the best of starts.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.120
Yeah.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.280
You know, there really are so many
wonderful things to do here, Rose.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.520
Pisa and Florence
are only a day away.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.560
And Genoa's just up the coast.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.240
Yes, we came through it
on the train.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.880
And there's an awful lot
closer to home.

33:07.880 --> 33:10.520
Every church seems to house
some treasure or other.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.040
It's like living in a museum.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.320
I do hope it's not too stuffy.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.240
Sorry?
What's that noise?

33:21.240 --> 33:22.520
CICADAS THRUM
What noise?

33:22.520 --> 33:25.800
That... awful throbbing hum.

33:25.800 --> 33:30.400
They are cicadas. They're insects,
like a sort of grasshopper.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.080
Why don't I see
if I can find one for you?

33:33.080 --> 33:35.920
They're always hanging around.
Oh, no. Lucian, don't.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.280
Honestly...
No, really.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.680
I simply can't abide bugs.

33:46.160 --> 33:50.760
Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise.

33:56.920 --> 34:00.280
Well, what about the girl?
Will she go along with it?

34:00.280 --> 34:04.400
Rose is entirely biddable.
She'll do whatever she's told.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.560
Your Ladyship.
Oh, Mrs Ainsworth. Good day.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.840
CHUCKLING
Thank you for the fun.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.160
CAR HORN HONKS

34:33.040 --> 34:36.760
Gosh! What a splendid entrance!

34:36.760 --> 34:39.480
Jack Turner at your service.
Benvenuti!

34:39.480 --> 34:41.480
Che bella!
Thank you.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.480
Prego.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.880
Billy. Please stop gawping.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.680
Oh, it's beautiful.
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

34:51.680 --> 34:53.840
Come, let me register you.

34:53.840 --> 34:58.200
If you'd like to sign
for yourself and... Mrs Turner?

34:59.720 --> 35:01.600
Thank you. Of course.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.480
So wonderful.
Perfect.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.200
Ah, oh. Look at this.
We can get you some tea.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.800
A little later, perhaps?

35:25.400 --> 35:27.280
Ladies.

35:27.280 --> 35:30.400
We're all the way at the top.
Oh!

35:30.400 --> 35:33.200
Billy shall bring your suitcases.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.640
How was your journey?
It was long, but beautiful.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.720
BUSY CHATTER

36:27.880 --> 36:30.160
Ah. Where is everybody?

36:30.160 --> 36:32.760
Well,
asleep if they've got any sense.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.320
Did you not fancy a siesta?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.320
You were up rather late last night.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.600
You know that I can't sleep
during the day.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.120
Did you want something?

36:43.120 --> 36:45.800
No, really, I'm just trying
to stay out of Father's way.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.760
Oh, Luc.
What?

36:47.760 --> 36:50.640
He's always chivvying away at me
for some reason or other.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.280
Can't you just tell him
that he doesn't need to worry?

36:53.280 --> 36:55.760
It's me that's worried.
Mm-hm.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.920
About this blasted wedding.

36:57.920 --> 37:01.000
No. About you.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.360
Well, you needn't be.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.120
You haven't been yourself lately.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.240
What exactly
is that supposed to mean?

37:13.240 --> 37:16.360
It means you've been
frittering your time away

37:16.360 --> 37:18.080
in the most unproductive fashion.

37:18.080 --> 37:22.080
Nice. You sound just like Father.
Go home, get a job, get married.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.440
I don't give a fig what you do.

37:24.440 --> 37:28.040
I just can't bear to see you failing
to use the most of your talents,

37:28.040 --> 37:30.280
when there are so many
who will never get a chance

37:30.280 --> 37:32.520
to show what
they might have been capable of.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.840
Well, Father says that painting
is a waste of time.

37:34.840 --> 37:38.520
No act of creativity is ever wasted.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.160
Mm-hm. And yet I can't remember
the last time

37:41.160 --> 37:43.640
I saw you
with a paintbrush in your hands.

37:43.640 --> 37:47.400
Ah, but that's because
now I have a different canvas.

37:49.120 --> 37:53.080
That's enough to fulfil you, is it?
That and motherhood.

37:54.680 --> 37:58.280
And... marriage to Father?

37:58.280 --> 38:00.760
Yes, of course.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.040
Of course.

38:05.480 --> 38:09.680
Can one find one's purpose
in loving someone?

38:11.080 --> 38:14.560
If you truly love them.
Yes, I think so.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.000
What if you don't?

38:22.920 --> 38:26.280
What are you two
skulking around out here for?

38:26.280 --> 38:30.160
Talking about creativity.
And love.

38:30.160 --> 38:33.320
Dear God.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.600
Oh, dear.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.240
Not bad, are they?
Oh.

38:52.240 --> 38:56.880
They're a lot better than "not bad."
Cecil Ainsworth.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.160
I imagine
you've already met my wife.

38:59.160 --> 39:04.000
Indeed I have. Jack Turner.
Is it a local artist?

39:04.000 --> 39:07.200
You could say that.
It's my son, Lucian.

39:07.200 --> 39:10.720
Really? Well, he has some talent.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.600
Yes, but... keep it to yourself,
old boy.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.040
The last thing I want him thinking

39:15.040 --> 39:17.160
is he can make his living
as a painter.

39:17.160 --> 39:21.440
CHUCKLING
Hmm. Are they for sale?

39:21.440 --> 39:25.160
They might be. Are you a collector?

39:25.160 --> 39:28.520
No, not really. But I know a few.

39:28.520 --> 39:30.120
Baby!

39:30.120 --> 39:33.800
This is Mr Ainsworth.
Enchanted.

39:35.880 --> 39:39.800
Are you sure you won't join me?
No. No, I'm gonna stroll into town.

39:41.560 --> 39:44.440
Well, this is much
the best time of day.

39:44.440 --> 39:47.000
Yes, quite.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.760
Aunt!

40:05.360 --> 40:07.760
Aunt!
Calm down, dear. Don't flap.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.480
But you have to see this!

40:11.560 --> 40:14.520
Good heavens!

40:17.680 --> 40:20.560
Oh! I feel quite unsteady.
Shall I fetch Mr Sengupta?

40:20.560 --> 40:24.360
No, no. That won't be necessary.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.080
Perhaps I'll have a glass
of that Italian lemonade

40:27.080 --> 40:31.320
I had for breakfast.
Yes, Aunt. Thank you, Aunt.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.880
Run along.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.360
Ah. I think you might be wise
to start with something

40:55.360 --> 40:58.200
a little less ambitious than Homer.
Wouldn't you say?

41:00.400 --> 41:03.320
I've been told that you need some
assistance with your letters.

41:03.320 --> 41:07.400
Well, I couldn't read the menu,
that's all. It was written funny.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.680
My mother was quite keen
that I give you a hand, so...

41:17.360 --> 41:19.520
I don't want to be here
any more than you do.

41:19.520 --> 41:23.760
So I think we ought to
just make the best of it, don't you?

41:23.760 --> 41:25.160
Please.

41:33.960 --> 41:37.400
Good. I thought we might
start with the alphabet.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.560
Aspetta. Aspetta un attimo.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.720
Buongiorno.
Buongiorno.

42:27.080 --> 42:31.400
Sono Vincenzo Danioni. Piacere.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.680
Siete un membro del partito?

42:35.680 --> 42:38.760
No.
No?

42:38.760 --> 42:40.840
Ma sto pensando di unirmi a voi.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.800
Una straniera.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.600
Che altro potrebbe essere?

42:54.280 --> 42:57.040
Siete all'hotel Inglese anche voi,
vero?

42:57.040 --> 42:58.680
Mm-hm.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.080
Spero vi guardiate alle spalle.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.720
Mio padre adora gli Inglesi.
Oh!

43:10.000 --> 43:13.120
Sono degli infidi bastardi, eh?

43:14.880 --> 43:16.680
THEY CHUCKLE

43:39.080 --> 43:40.560
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

43:42.360 --> 43:45.320
Are you finished?
I have to go.

43:45.320 --> 43:50.000
Steady on. Let's have a look.
Are we doing the same time tomorrow?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.440
Let me talk to Mrs Mays-Smith.

44:25.640 --> 44:27.800
'Norma: Casta Diva'

46:30.040 --> 46:31.920
Mind if I join?

46:31.920 --> 46:34.880
Oh. No.

46:34.880 --> 46:37.360
Please, be my guest.

46:39.160 --> 46:42.720
Cigar?
Oh, no. I...

46:42.720 --> 46:45.480
Don't worry, they're imported.

46:45.480 --> 46:48.800
There are certain things
you don't rely on the Italians for.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.360
Ah-ha.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.400
Thank you.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.120
You were, er...

46:59.120 --> 47:03.040
You were telling me about your
connections in the art world.

47:03.040 --> 47:06.520
Was I?
Yes.

47:07.840 --> 47:10.920
I can tell you have an eye for it.
Is it your line of work?

47:10.920 --> 47:15.880
Well. I buy and sell a bit.

47:15.880 --> 47:20.160
Oh, you have a gallery.
Private clients.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.640
And, er...

47:23.240 --> 47:25.720
And do you think they might
be interested in purchasing

47:25.720 --> 47:27.680
some of Lucian's work?

47:27.680 --> 47:31.600
Oh, no. No, no.
My interest was entirely personal.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.080
Oh.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.600
There's really not much money
to be made

47:38.600 --> 47:40.560
from anything painted this century.

47:40.560 --> 47:43.200
Unless you're Matisse, of course.
Quite.

47:44.600 --> 47:48.280
Now, the Renaissance,
that, my friend...

47:48.280 --> 47:50.480
Whole other ball game.

47:50.480 --> 47:54.000
Really?  Yeah.
That's what paid for the Mercedes.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.080
The Old Masters?
Mm-hm.

48:00.280 --> 48:03.600
They're selling like hot cakes
back in the States.

48:03.600 --> 48:07.720
Museums. Old money.
Wall Street bankers. Just...

48:07.720 --> 48:10.800
can't get enough of them.
How fascinating.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.560
Of course, the smart money
is in authentication.

48:13.560 --> 48:16.560
If you're gonna spend
a hundred grand on a Tintoretto,

48:16.560 --> 48:19.480
you're gonna want to make sure
you got what you've paid for.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.080
And they pay for your seal
of approval?

48:22.080 --> 48:25.160
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Not mine, buddy, but...

48:25.160 --> 48:28.320
Well, I have the best guy
in the business.

48:40.520 --> 48:45.840
I don't mind telling you... I wept
buckets while I were reading it.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.160
Bless your kind heart.
When your mam wrote me,

48:49.160 --> 48:51.480
and asked me
to find you a place here...

48:51.480 --> 48:53.800
I never dreamt the reason.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.200
You weren't to know.

48:58.520 --> 49:02.280
You've had a terrible time of it.
Poor little petal.

49:02.280 --> 49:07.280
No wonder you jumped at the chance
to come here.

49:07.280 --> 49:10.360
For a fresh start, hey?
Somewhere far away.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.880
So that's just what
we're going to give you.

49:16.880 --> 49:21.720
A new beginning. A chance to put
all your troubles behind you.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.440
Time heals everything, sweetheart.

49:28.640 --> 49:32.280
Time, hard work.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.520
And good food.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.840
Yeah.

49:41.680 --> 49:45.560
HE WHISTLES

50:00.400 --> 50:03.000
BUSY CHATTER

50:22.960 --> 50:25.760
Yes, I would like to send
a telegram.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.800
Si.
You understand English?

50:27.800 --> 50:28.960
Si.
Jolly good.

50:32.600 --> 50:36.480
Proposition for you. Stop.

50:37.720 --> 50:41.040
Make us both rich. Stop.

50:41.040 --> 50:44.720
Telephone 27th. Stop.

50:44.720 --> 50:47.600
Cecil. Stop.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.800
The king had a forbidding scowl,
which nearly made the tiger...

50:52.800 --> 50:54.120
Growl.

50:54.120 --> 50:58.800
But T, without a trace of awe, said,
"Give His Majesty a..."

50:58.800 --> 51:03.160
"..paw."
He added with...

51:03.160 --> 51:07.280
Oh, buongiorno.
Madam.

51:10.960 --> 51:15.360
Buongiorno. Sono il Signor Danioni
del Consiglio comunale.

51:15.360 --> 51:17.480
Ah!
Molto piacere di conoscervi.

51:17.480 --> 51:20.680
Benvenuto.
Grazie. Parlate Italiano?

51:20.680 --> 51:22.760
Un pochino.

51:22.760 --> 51:26.200
Eccellente. E molto bello, eh!

51:26.200 --> 51:27.840
Grazie.

51:27.840 --> 51:31.760
C'e un posto dove possiamo parlare
in privato?

51:31.760 --> 51:35.720
Mio marito non e qui, temo.
Tornera piu tardi.

51:35.720 --> 51:38.000
I see.

51:38.000 --> 51:44.080
Let me make this clear for you... it
isn't your husband I wanna speak to.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.960
It is you, Mrs Ainsworth.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.960
Very good.

51:52.520 --> 51:54.600
Lottie, I'll be back in a minute.

51:54.600 --> 51:57.360
Constance, will you carry on
rehearsing our play?

51:57.360 --> 52:00.720
My office is just this way.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.680
Hello, little one.

52:03.680 --> 52:06.440
Please. Do come in.

52:06.440 --> 52:09.960
Prego.
Grazie.

52:17.120 --> 52:19.440
Your daughter?
Oh, my granddaughter.

52:19.440 --> 52:23.440
And her nanny.
Ha! The great British nanny, huh?

52:23.440 --> 52:25.480
The rock on which
an empire is built.

52:28.360 --> 52:32.000
Signore, how can I help you?

52:32.000 --> 52:36.880
Well, it is a... delicate matter.

52:36.880 --> 52:40.360
Let's see, how to start this...

52:44.320 --> 52:46.760
I believe this belongs to you.

52:47.920 --> 52:49.520
Who gave that to you?

52:49.520 --> 52:52.440
You have to know nothing happens
here without me knowing about it.

52:52.440 --> 52:53.720
But this is a private letter!

52:53.720 --> 52:55.840
I know, full of private sentiments

52:55.840 --> 52:58.280
and it will be
"una grande disgrazia."

52:58.280 --> 53:01.120
I mean,
it would be a disaster if this...

53:01.120 --> 53:04.440
How do you say?
Fall into the wrong hands?

53:06.680 --> 53:08.360
Yes. You're quite right.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.080
Well, then, I must thank you
for returning it, Signore.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.960
Please...
Sure.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.520
Let's hope the many letters
you wrote

53:19.520 --> 53:22.840
have reached their destination. Hmm?

53:24.440 --> 53:30.040
Signore...
What exactly is it that you want?

53:33.320 --> 53:36.160
What we all want, Signora Ainsworth.

53:39.640 --> 53:41.400
Soldi.
