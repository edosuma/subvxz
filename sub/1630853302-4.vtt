00:11.541 --> 00:13.291
Becca. Becca.

00:13.375 --> 00:15.041
- Becca.

00:15.125 --> 00:18.125
- Wake up, Becca.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.250
Please help me.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.750
What happened?

00:20.875 --> 00:22.666
Alma?

00:23.916 --> 00:25.083
Wait.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.333
You're the lady
from the pyramid.

00:26.416 --> 00:28.041
Yes, I am.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.250
Let's bring her inside.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.583
She needs to lie down.

00:38.541 --> 00:40.833
You painted
all of these?

00:40.916 --> 00:42.666
Yes.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.833
You're Alejandro?

00:46.916 --> 00:49.375
Rosario Alejandro.

00:49.458 --> 00:52.041
Your last name is Alejandro.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.250
Becca.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.083
Becca.

01:01.166 --> 01:02.125
Can you hear me?

01:02.208 --> 01:03.875
How do you know her name?

01:03.958 --> 01:05.833
Your mother talks
about you girls all the time.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.208
Our mom is here?

01:07.250 --> 01:09.916
She's out at the moment,
but she'll be back.

01:10.000 --> 01:10.916
She okay?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.458
She's taking care of herself.

01:12.541 --> 01:15.125
And what about her?
Is she gonna be okay, too?

01:15.208 --> 01:18.291
She needs grounding.

01:19.833 --> 01:23.916
Her branches are spreading
faster than her roots.

01:44.041 --> 01:45.541
- Alma.
- Hey, Dad.

01:45.625 --> 01:46.541
How's it going?

01:46.625 --> 01:48.166
I've been trying to call you.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.875
Random question for you

01:49.958 --> 01:51.958
when you were doing
your research,

01:52.041 --> 01:54.000
did anyone ever,
like, pass out?

01:54.083 --> 01:56.666
Are you with Becca right now?
Put her on.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.041
Okay, well, it's not a big
deal, but Becca... fainted?

02:00.125 --> 02:02.041
- What's happening?
- It could've been
something she ate

02:02.125 --> 02:03.583
or dehydration.

02:03.666 --> 02:06.250
Or there's, like,
a teeny-tiny, teeny-tiny chance

02:06.333 --> 02:07.708
that it's because we used
her ability.

02:07.791 --> 02:09.291
But, like, a little.
It's probably not even that.

02:09.416 --> 02:11.250
Where are you right now?
I'm coming over.

02:11.291 --> 02:13.333
We're in Mexico.

02:13.416 --> 02:15.208
- What?
- We were tracking down Mom.

02:15.291 --> 02:16.541
And we found her, by the way.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.125
Well, we're about to find her.

02:18.208 --> 02:19.791
We found her stuff in
this house. It's a long story.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.916
Uh, text me the address, okay?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.208
I-I'm booking a flight.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.625
You don't have to do that.

02:24.708 --> 02:26.583
Just do it. I'm coming.

02:26.666 --> 02:29.541
Okay, I-I'll do it.

02:52.708 --> 02:56.541
Is Becca working through
something related to a baby?

02:56.625 --> 02:57.875
Yeah, actually.

02:57.958 --> 03:00.541
She's deciding
whether she wants to have one.

03:02.125 --> 03:04.208
She needs to rest.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.791
So you know my mom.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.791
What a strange coincidence.

03:09.875 --> 03:12.291
Coincidence is
just the universe

03:12.375 --> 03:14.458
nudging you
in the right direction.

03:14.541 --> 03:15.583
Did you get that from a meme?

03:15.666 --> 03:17.541
- Yes.

03:18.916 --> 03:21.666
So, what is it that you do,
exactly?

03:21.750 --> 03:25.875
I help people heal
from their wounds

03:25.958 --> 03:28.708
and see things
that they need to see.

03:28.791 --> 03:29.791
You're a curandera?

03:29.875 --> 03:31.166
Mm.

03:32.166 --> 03:35.000
I feel like my mom wouldn't be
into that kind of thing.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.000
It's always a shock to discover

03:37.083 --> 03:39.875
that your parents are
real people with rich lives.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.625
So how do you know her?

03:41.708 --> 03:44.041
Many years ago,

03:44.125 --> 03:46.208
she was crying
in the courtyard.

03:46.291 --> 03:47.958
I asked her if she needed help.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.041
And she did.

03:49.125 --> 03:51.041
She rented a room in this house

03:51.125 --> 03:53.166
while she mended
her heartbreak.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.750
Why did she keep you a secret?

04:00.541 --> 04:02.541
You have a door
you need to open.

04:02.625 --> 04:04.208
What do you...

04:04.291 --> 04:05.875
What kind of door?

04:07.250 --> 04:09.583
A door you don't want to open.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.583
I wouldn't say
I don't want to open it.

04:12.666 --> 04:14.625
The door does not want
to be opened.

04:14.708 --> 04:17.000
The door is stopping you
from opening it?

04:17.125 --> 04:18.833
Yes.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.708
Maybe...

04:20.750 --> 04:24.375
you're afraid of what might be
behind the door.

04:24.458 --> 04:25.500
Hmm?

04:40.958 --> 04:42.083
Alma?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.041
What?

04:57.583 --> 04:59.000
Alma?

05:02.208 --> 05:04.291
Alma?

05:04.375 --> 05:05.875
Is anyone here?

05:14.458 --> 05:16.500
Shh. Are you okay?

05:20.083 --> 05:22.375
Are you hungry?

05:22.458 --> 05:23.750
Shh.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.958
I don't know what to give you.

05:28.916 --> 05:31.041
Okay, okay. Here.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.666
- Try that.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.833
There you go.

05:35.958 --> 05:37.500
Oh, you like that?

05:43.541 --> 05:44.458
Dad.

05:44.541 --> 05:46.166
What are you doing here?

05:46.250 --> 05:48.166
Alma called when you collapsed.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.583
I rushed right down.
How are you feeling?

05:54.416 --> 05:56.000
Fine. I guess.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.791
Good. Good.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.208
Hey. Dad.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.625
You made it!

06:00.708 --> 06:02.041
Look who's up and about.

06:02.125 --> 06:03.083
Sleepyhead.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.458
Guess everybody's doing great.

06:04.541 --> 06:05.916
What time is it?

06:06.916 --> 06:08.166
Who are you?

06:10.750 --> 06:12.666
- Where do I go now?
- Come with me.

06:13.708 --> 06:17.166
Uh, maybe Becca should lie down
a little longer.

06:19.708 --> 06:21.666
Welcome!

06:22.666 --> 06:24.291
Okay, there's a flight tonight.

06:24.375 --> 06:25.583
We're all going home.

06:25.666 --> 06:27.125
But Mom's stuff is here.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.666
We should wait for her.

06:28.750 --> 06:32.250
I told you explicitly not
to dig into your mother's past.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.291
And now Becca's exhausted

06:34.375 --> 06:35.791
'cause you don't know
what the hell you're doing.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.000
Dad, it's fine.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.291
You're lucky you're okay.

06:38.375 --> 06:39.875
Could've been much worse.

06:39.958 --> 06:42.333
Dad, please help us find Mom.

06:42.416 --> 06:43.708
You must know
what this is about.

06:43.791 --> 06:46.666
Everything was fine
until you two started digging.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.125
- We're sorry, Dad.
- No, we're not, Becca.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.166
- This family is being
suffocated from avoidance,

06:51.250 --> 06:53.625
and you seem perfectly fine
to let it die.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.458
But now that we have
Becca's ability,

06:55.541 --> 06:57.291
we can figure out
what's going on.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.583
We can help Mom.

06:58.666 --> 06:59.916
We can make our lives better.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.750
You pushed Becca
till she collapsed.

07:01.833 --> 07:03.916
You know what could happen
if you push her too hard?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.583
- What can happen?
- She's fine.

07:05.666 --> 07:06.750
Becca, tell him you're fine.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.916
- You don't hear that?
- Hear what?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.791
Are you sure
you're feeling all right?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.291
You know what?

07:13.375 --> 07:15.041
The only reason you're afraid
to go into your memories

07:15.125 --> 07:16.541
is because you're afraid
what kind of secrets

07:16.625 --> 07:17.708
are going to come out.

07:17.791 --> 07:19.541
Wait, wait, wait.
What secrets?

07:19.625 --> 07:20.958
Look,
your mother is reactive

07:21.041 --> 07:22.541
- and emotional.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.458
I can't help it.
She's always been like that.

07:24.541 --> 07:26.500
- But she...
Dad, come on.
- Now, look, enough.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.708
- Shh.
- There's
a00 flight, and we're all

07:28.791 --> 07:29.875
gonna be on it.

07:32.708 --> 07:34.166
That's it. We're leaving.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.291
- Dad.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.541
Dad.

07:36.625 --> 07:38.833
- Dad, please don't do this.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.583
Don't you want to know
what we found out about Mom?

07:40.666 --> 07:42.750
It's none of my business.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.500
So you don't want to know
why she ran off?

07:44.583 --> 07:47.000
Where she is?
What's upsetting her?

07:47.083 --> 07:49.500
- What if she is having
an affair?

07:54.125 --> 07:55.708
I'm sorry about this.

07:55.791 --> 07:58.458
Uh, we'll be outside.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.291
If your mother's having
an affair,

08:05.375 --> 08:07.125
I don't want to know about it.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.666
Dad, come on.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.583
I've done everything to make
things nice for you girls.

08:11.666 --> 08:13.291
I just want everyone
to be happy.

08:13.375 --> 08:14.375
Are you happy?

08:15.416 --> 08:17.583
- 'Cause I am not happy.

08:17.666 --> 08:19.375
Well, the Alma I knew
was happy.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.958
Till you came through
and decided to fix everything.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.833
Dad, I found letters
that I've written you,

08:23.916 --> 08:25.625
that she's written you.

08:25.708 --> 08:26.958
She's not happy.

08:27.041 --> 08:28.333
She's stressed out.

08:28.416 --> 08:29.916
She doesn't want to do
this PhD program,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.166
but she's not brave enough
to tell you.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.250
I mean, what does that say?

08:32.291 --> 08:33.416
The program is hard.

08:33.541 --> 08:35.291
But the rewards are worth it.

08:35.375 --> 08:36.666
Everything is fine...

08:36.750 --> 08:38.375
Everything is not fine!

08:38.458 --> 08:39.625
You are not fine.

08:39.708 --> 08:41.375
Mom is not fine.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.791
Something is wrong here.

08:46.208 --> 08:51.041
I'm just asking you
to look at it.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.916
Please.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.291
Look into the past.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.208
See how things got
to this place

08:56.291 --> 08:58.041
and what we might be able
to do to fix it.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.208
No.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.541
It's over, Jacob.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.583
Listen, when I do that work,
I become obsessed.

09:16.666 --> 09:18.666
I don't want to be
that man again.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.291
Dad, you won't.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.166
How do you know that?

09:26.916 --> 09:29.583
Air Mexico.
How can I help you?

09:29.666 --> 09:31.208
I have to take this.

09:31.291 --> 09:32.291
Hello?

09:33.375 --> 09:35.291
Is someone there?

09:35.375 --> 09:36.833
Hello?

09:36.916 --> 09:38.166
Yeah.

09:41.958 --> 09:43.375
There you go.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.958
You're all right.

09:47.541 --> 09:49.500
Whose baby are you?

09:49.583 --> 09:51.375
Are you my baby?

09:51.458 --> 09:54.500
I can't call you
from my house anymore...

09:54.583 --> 09:57.833
And you can't call me.

09:58.708 --> 10:00.041
Do you understand?

10:01.458 --> 10:02.833
You're my baby.

10:02.916 --> 10:04.708
- I'm your mommy.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.541
W... I don't understand why
I can't use my points for...

10:22.625 --> 10:24.250
- W... Hello?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.125
Goddamn it!

10:31.875 --> 10:33.250
Camila?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.083
No.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.041
What are we doing?

11:09.291 --> 11:11.291
You seem impatient.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.291
I'm trying to find answers
in the past,

11:14.375 --> 11:16.291
but my dad won't look
at his own shit.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.958
- First it was the door
and now your father?

11:19.041 --> 11:20.666
I want to get through the door.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.791
- I really tried.
- Show me.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.125
Uh...

11:27.208 --> 11:29.208
Okay.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.125
Full disclosure,
it's gonna be weird.

11:44.916 --> 11:46.208
This is your door?

11:47.333 --> 11:48.583
You see that?

11:48.666 --> 11:50.541
Open the door.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.208
I promise you,

11:52.291 --> 11:53.875
I have tried to open it.

11:53.958 --> 11:56.791
I have tried pulling.
I tried pushing.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.208
I bodychecked it.

11:58.291 --> 12:00.666
The door does not want
to be opened, okay?

12:00.750 --> 12:01.625
Look.

12:01.708 --> 12:02.750
- Do you see?!
- Shh!

12:04.375 --> 12:07.708
Have you tried being quiet?

12:09.250 --> 12:10.916
No.

12:20.916 --> 12:22.833
Holy shit. Holy shit,
holy shit, holy shit,

12:22.916 --> 12:25.083
holy shit.
There's someone in there.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.583
Hello in there?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
- It stopped.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.916
God, it sounded like a child.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.708
Maybe.

12:51.791 --> 12:53.958
Excuse me, miss.
I was wondering if I could...

12:54.041 --> 12:56.500
get in on a tour
of the archaeological site.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.125
Oh. I'm sorry.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.458
The last tour of the day
started 20 minutes ago.

13:00.541 --> 13:01.458
Oh.

13:01.541 --> 13:02.708
You can come back tomorrow.

13:02.791 --> 13:04.125
Actually, I have a flight
to catch in the morning.

13:04.208 --> 13:05.583
But thanks.

13:05.666 --> 13:07.000
Oh.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It's okay.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.791
I can take you.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.375
The temple remained buried
until nine years ago

13:14.458 --> 13:15.958
when electrical workers
discovered

13:16.041 --> 13:17.583
the Coyolxauhqui Stone.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.916
And the temple was found again.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.833
Well, you really know
your stuff.

13:23.208 --> 13:26.125
No. I just memorized
what they told me.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.083
Let me give you
a little secret:

13:28.166 --> 13:30.791
that's what all professors do.

13:30.875 --> 13:31.916
You're a professor?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.833
Yeah. In San Antonio.

13:33.916 --> 13:35.375
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

13:35.458 --> 13:39.375
I have thought about studying
in the United States, but...

13:39.458 --> 13:41.125
- But what?

13:42.458 --> 13:44.500
Nothing. It's nothing.

13:45.541 --> 13:46.708
You should apply.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.958
Do you want to get
a coffee after this

13:51.041 --> 13:52.375
and talk more about it?

13:52.458 --> 13:54.583
I would love to.

13:54.666 --> 13:56.750
This place is really great.

13:56.833 --> 14:00.125
Do you come here often with
your friends or family or...

14:00.208 --> 14:03.458
I don't know, boyfriend?

14:03.541 --> 14:06.416
No, I-I usually come here
alone.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.500
So, no friends or family or...

14:08.583 --> 14:10.166
boyfriend to speak of?

14:11.750 --> 14:12.750
A few friends.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.708
Um, no boyfriend.

14:14.791 --> 14:18.458
And, yes, I have a family,
but, um...

14:18.541 --> 14:20.250
we're not speaking right now.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.375
Why not?

14:23.375 --> 14:25.083
It's a Catholic thing.

14:26.708 --> 14:29.291
I'm not speaking
to my family either.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.416
- Why is that?
- Oh, it's a...

14:31.500 --> 14:33.541
"my dad's an asshole" thing.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.083
He divorced my mother

14:36.166 --> 14:38.166
while she was
in a mental hospital.

14:39.416 --> 14:41.041
She was in a mental hospital?

14:41.125 --> 14:42.208
In and out.

14:42.291 --> 14:45.291
Some people say...
schizophrenia.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.625
But you don't think so?

14:47.708 --> 14:49.166
You could call it... that.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.750
But, uh, she's so much more
than her episodes, right?

14:52.833 --> 14:56.250
She's vibrant and intelligent
and thoughtful.

14:56.333 --> 14:59.041
She doesn't deserve
to be abandoned.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.541
No.

15:01.625 --> 15:04.125
No one does.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.041
I'm gonna find a way
to help her.

15:07.125 --> 15:10.250
- You are?
- Yeah, I'm dedicating
my life to it.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.416
That is wonderful.

15:22.458 --> 15:24.458
It's so beautiful.

15:26.208 --> 15:27.625
When I was a child,

15:27.708 --> 15:29.916
my grandmother told me
that the shooting stars

15:30.000 --> 15:32.416
were the tears of saints.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.166
I like that.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.666
Some people say that they're...

15:39.750 --> 15:43.083
particles caused
by the disintegration of comets

15:43.166 --> 15:45.250
and when they collide
with our atmosphere,

15:45.333 --> 15:46.583
they heat up and burn bright.

15:46.666 --> 15:47.583
But, uh...

15:47.666 --> 15:49.750
tears of saints.

15:49.833 --> 15:51.333
I think I like that better.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.458
What's wrong?

15:57.541 --> 16:00.208
Oh.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.291
Nothing.

16:02.375 --> 16:05.125
I-I like your version.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.458
That, uh...

16:07.541 --> 16:10.083
things left behind
can burn so bright.

16:25.958 --> 16:27.708
What are you looking for?

16:28.750 --> 16:31.083
I-I don't know. I-I...

16:31.166 --> 16:34.083
I feel like I lost something.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.708
Something is missing.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.041
Should I, uh, turn around?

16:38.125 --> 16:40.375
No. I...

16:42.458 --> 16:44.458
Everything good?

16:44.541 --> 16:46.541
It's nothing.

16:46.625 --> 16:49.750
Hey, thank you for spending
so much time with my mother.

16:49.833 --> 16:53.208
But if it's too much, you
don't have to keep doing it.

16:54.333 --> 16:58.000
Your mother has... cared for me
when my own mother wouldn't.

17:00.666 --> 17:02.083
But, uh...

17:02.166 --> 17:04.375
maybe I do need a little break.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.500
Okay.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.333
You don't remember making
nine long-distance calls

17:15.416 --> 17:17.500
to a strange number in Mexico?

17:17.583 --> 17:19.416
What are you saying?
That I'm lying?

17:19.500 --> 17:21.583
No, I'm wondering
if these are false charges.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.916
But it-it's strange
that you would assume

17:24.000 --> 17:25.166
that I'm accusing you of lying.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.250
Are you lying?

17:26.333 --> 17:27.916
There you go,
accusing me of lying.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.458
Camila, what is this about?!

17:29.541 --> 17:30.875
Nothing!

17:47.666 --> 17:50.000
Look, um...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.250
There's something
that's been with your mother

17:53.333 --> 17:54.958
since I met her.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.416
And I don't know what it is.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.458
She never told me.

17:59.541 --> 18:02.041
And I never wanted
to press too hard.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.208
I was afraid
of what I might find.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.208
It's okay, Dad.

18:06.291 --> 18:07.541
We'll figure it out.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.958
I just wanted to do
the right thing.

18:11.041 --> 18:13.916
I just wanted things to be
better for everyone so that...

18:16.666 --> 18:19.500
...changing time
would have been worth it and...

18:19.583 --> 18:22.416
me being alive...

18:22.500 --> 18:25.333
would have made things better.

18:25.416 --> 18:28.041
You being alive is better.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.750
I'm not so sure.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.916
What...

18:57.250 --> 18:58.750
Hold on! I'm coming for you!

19:00.000 --> 19:01.916
What... What...

19:04.458 --> 19:06.458
- Where are you?!

19:07.500 --> 19:09.708
Where are you?!

19:19.500 --> 19:21.916
Where are you taking my baby?!

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
I thought you didn't
want to know.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.625
Do you want to hold him
one last time?

19:46.625 --> 19:49.250
Can I... spend some time
with him?

19:50.625 --> 19:51.541
Just an hour.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.208
It'll make it harder...

19:53.916 --> 19:55.500
I know.

19:59.125 --> 20:01.041
I want him to be named
after you.

20:02.666 --> 20:05.208
Alejandro.

20:12.041 --> 20:15.166
I wish I could give you
a good life.

20:15.250 --> 20:17.083
But...

20:18.541 --> 20:20.750
...you're going to
have a better life...

20:22.166 --> 20:24.500
...than I can give you.

20:27.541 --> 20:28.458
Becca.

20:28.541 --> 20:30.875
- Oh, my God.
- Careful, there's glass.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.291
Ay. Híjole.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.208
I'll get disinfectant.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.458
You reflect her,

20:44.541 --> 20:46.291
but you are not her.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.291
Once you understand yourself,

20:49.375 --> 20:51.500
you will know what you want.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.750
Hey.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.208
Are you okay?

20:56.291 --> 20:59.375
We had no idea you were
still going through something.

21:02.375 --> 21:05.208
Mom had a baby boy
in this house.

21:05.291 --> 21:08.458
That's Alejandro.

21:09.541 --> 21:11.250
That's Mom's secret.

21:14.041 --> 21:14.958
What's wrong?

21:15.041 --> 21:16.500
Nothing.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.750
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.250
Nothing!

21:21.250 --> 21:23.666
We have to go find your mother.
