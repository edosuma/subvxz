it's really never
just his fault.

That whole Niagara Falls story,
you giving permission.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.235
That wasn't true.
You knew that that couple

00:18.279 --> 00:21.151
wasn't coming back
to Mosswood with your son.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.632

heard all about you.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.510
- My advice:
heavy metal and tear gas.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.164
It worked at Waco.

00:34.208 --> 00:38.081

and he's ordered an MHE

00:38.125 --> 00:40.170
psychological evaluation.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.780
- So why did you
give her the tea?

00:41.824 --> 00:44.827
- Because she lied.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.089

It's okay, it's okay.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.196
- You're limping.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.069
Sit down.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.203
Sit.

37:12.317 --> 37:15.450
- It's swollen,
and I don't have any ice.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.262
- No.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.309
- Don't move.

38:02.889 --> 38:06.327
- The Beacon.

38:06.371 --> 38:07.589
He was the leader of Mosswood

38:07.633 --> 38:09.939
back when Mosswood
had a leader.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.028
This is his cabin.

38:12.072 --> 38:14.335
- What time
is he expected home?

38:14.379 --> 38:16.206
- He's gone now.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.252
But he did most of his
writing and meditating

38:18.296 --> 38:21.342
right here in this room.

38:21.386 --> 38:24.258
Green tea.
Not Jimson Weed.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.044
This is where he
developed the ideas

38:28.088 --> 38:31.483
I'm trying
to pass on to my son.

38:33.441 --> 38:36.183
- Most of us spend our lives
trying to suppress

38:36.226 --> 38:39.099
the parts of ourselves
we deem inappropriate.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.885
We spend our lives
trying to detach

38:42.929 --> 38:46.280
from all of that
beautiful feeling.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.413
And it doesn't work, does it?

38:52.330 --> 38:55.245
Julian is a new kind of man.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.205
At one with nature.

38:59.119 --> 39:03.602
Fluid with all of the darkness,
and all of the light.

39:05.255 --> 39:06.387
- You're never going to show me

39:06.431 --> 39:08.607
what the work actually is,
are you?

39:10.435 --> 39:12.045
- You've already been doing it.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.310
Can I ask you?

39:20.488 --> 39:23.491
Did your mother ever leave you
lost in the woods?

39:26.668 --> 39:29.062
- I'm not here
to talk about my mother.

39:33.196 --> 39:35.329
- What are you feeling
right now?

39:36.461 --> 39:38.071
Be honest.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.730
- I don't trust you.

39:44.773 --> 39:47.341
- That's fear.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.387
I'm scared, too.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.392
And a sexual pull, right here.

39:58.178 --> 40:02.008
- I don't know.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.184
There's no way to know.

40:07.187 --> 40:08.536
What else?

40:12.714 --> 40:14.499
- Anger.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.372
- Rage.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.464
Oh...

40:32.125 --> 40:34.344
And underneath that rage,

40:34.388 --> 40:37.086
if you could just taste
what's there.

40:38.087 --> 40:40.263
What would it be?

40:43.310 --> 40:50.360
♪

41:13.383 --> 41:15.037
Mom?

41:29.443 --> 41:33.099
Oh, God, oh, God.
