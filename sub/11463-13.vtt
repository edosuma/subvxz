00:37.579 --> 00:40.412
- Hey, open up!
- Please! Please, open up!

00:41.249 --> 00:42.785
I'm sorry.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.244
We need help!

00:46.046 --> 00:47.536
Please let us in!

00:47.714 --> 00:50.706
We can '1‘ let you in. We 're sorry.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.217
- What about my son?
- We 7/ ﬁgure something out.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.629
We have nothing and you have a castle!

00:57.807 --> 00:59.013
We know, we know.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.640
You even have electricity!

01:00.810 --> 01:01.720
Please!

01:01.936 --> 01:03.142
It was a mistake.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.229
- Yeah, her mistake.
- She knows.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.518
I'm so sorry.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.642
I'm sorry.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.707
Shut up, shut up!

02:15.844 --> 02:18.176
I don't wanna die here!
I don't wanna die!

02:18.304 --> 02:20.920
Just let me goddamn think!

02:21.057 --> 02:23.890
- I'm gonna die. - No way, bro,
we're not gonna let that happen.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.519
What do you mean, man?

02:25.645 --> 02:27.260
What are you gonna do?
I'm bleeding.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.978
The bullet might have hit
an artery.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.189
If it did, he wouldn't be talking
right now.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.978
What the hell
do you know?

02:33.111 --> 02:34.442
- You said you were a teacher.
- I was.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.983
What'd you even teach?
What'd he teach?

02:37.115 --> 02:39.322
- English lit. - LAUSD made me
take a course every year.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.576
Oh, Christ.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.363
I'd do CPR,
first responder basics.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.905
I know a little,
not a lot.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.120
I need to look at this, okay?

02:46.249 --> 02:48.240
It's gone through and through.
That's good.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.241
- How is that good?
- We don't have to dig out the slug.

02:50.378 --> 02:54.041
So you take both hands. Top and bottom,
squeeze together nice and tight.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.665
We have to stop that bleeding.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.757
- I'm gonna try to stitch it up.
- With what?

02:58.887 --> 03:00.798
With whatever I can find
in his house.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.802
It's gonna be okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.093
You okay, bro?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.891
My man
can take the pain.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.844
- What pain?
- Exactly.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.477
All right, we have
to roll him over.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.979
What? We're not done?

04:01.115 --> 04:02.776
You've still got
an exit wound, bro.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.195
Help me move him.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.625
Talk to me, man.
What's going on?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.704
It hurts, huh,
when we move you?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.295
Okay, I need
you to breathe.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.338
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.837
I'm gonna stitch you up.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.805
When we're done,
I'm not gonna move you.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.765
- Okay.
- Not gonna move you anymore.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.885
- Okay?
- For how long?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.142
Until he's better.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.266
But he'll get better?

04:41.531 --> 04:44.614
Yeah, yeah,
he's gonna get better.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.156
Okay.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.392
I don't even
know your name.

06:01.694 --> 06:05.027
You're so...

06:05.156 --> 06:07.021
Yo, James.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.443
What you in
the mood for, man?

06:08.576 --> 06:11.318
Breast, wing?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.319
Anything
but a thigh, man.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.835
How you feeling?

06:27.845 --> 06:30.006
Pretty good.
Better.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.095
What's your pain level?

06:34.936 --> 06:36.642
Scale of one to 10?

06:36.771 --> 06:39.012
Like, a three.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.639
Three?

06:41.776 --> 06:43.937
Maybe a four.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.062
Well, four is still
pretty good considering.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.731
The protein will help,
though”.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.325
with the healing,
don't you think?

06:57.166 --> 06:59.327
Can't hurt.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.373
Listen,
I can't help you

07:06.509 --> 07:07.919
if you won't tell me
what's going on.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.714
So if things
are getting any worse,

07:10.847 --> 07:13.805
you need to let me know.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.682
Try and get some rest.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.521
You gonna have
any chicken, Mr. Manawa?

07:22.650 --> 07:25.016
No, we should be eating
the eggs.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.946
Chris, come on.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.190
We need to talk.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.738
Sure.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.114
What do you want?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.332
Wipe your face
off first.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.076
VVhy?

07:43.212 --> 07:44.827
Because you're
covered in grease.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.670
What difference
does it make?

07:46.799 --> 07:48.585
You killed
a man today, Chris.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.300
Look at him.

07:51.429 --> 07:55.092
The least you could
do is let it affect your appetite.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.398
I need to know
what's going on.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.441
What are you
thinking, huh?

08:11.574 --> 08:13.690
I mean, are you
thinking anything?

08:13.826 --> 08:15.566
He shot James.

08:15.703 --> 08:18.069
Dad, he shot my friend.
What was I supposed to do?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.697
- He's not your friend.
- He is.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.824
- They are.
- They are savages.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.417
So I'm a savage.
Is that what you're saying...

08:25.546 --> 08:28.788
Chris, where the hell
is your remorse?

08:28.925 --> 08:32.133
This is how
it works now.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.377
Look around.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.506
There is no more good,
there is no more bad, right or wrong.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.632
There is no more good,
there is no more bad, right or wrong.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.224
It's us or them,
kill or be killed.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.968
And James,
he's one of us.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.766
You've known these guys
for two days.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.890
Did what I had to do.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.062
I'm sorry,
but I'm not sorry.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.231
Oh, God.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.605
Remember the first few months
of middle school?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.657
Middle school?

08:57.662 --> 09:01.496
I would hide every recess

09:01.624 --> 09:03.910
because the football guys
used to make fun of me.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.453
Remember that?

09:05.586 --> 09:07.872
What'd you
use to tell me?

09:09.048 --> 09:10.584
I told you
to play along.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.092
To try to fit in.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.628
Well?

09:13.761 --> 09:16.218
The lesson
was to play along,

09:16.347 --> 09:19.760
to act as if,
not to become one of them.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.224
You don't fit
in with these guys.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.719
We all know that.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.983
But what you did,
saving James today, that was huge.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.101
You proved your worth.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.398
Shoot, you could come out
of this a hero.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.193
I don't want to be a hero
to these guys and neither should you.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.451
Look, just be careful
how you play this, Dad.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.290
We need them.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.577
No, we don't.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.701
I do.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.299
Excuse me! Excuse me!
This is my wife!

09:55.469 --> 09:57.460
Open up! Let us in!

10:00.057 --> 10:02.013
- Open the gate. Open the gate.
- No.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.349
- Is she crazy?
- That's Travis.

10:03.477 --> 10:04.683
That's who I was talking
to you about.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.178
He's family.
He's family.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.476
- That's my family.
- Ah!

10:09.609 --> 10:12.396
Where's Chris?

10:12.528 --> 10:14.860
I don't know.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.901
We saw the lights! The lights!

10:19.118 --> 10:20.403
Let us in!

10:28.336 --> 10:30.668
Push against the gates!

10:31.756 --> 10:33.462
Al dentro!

10:57.406 --> 10:59.112
You want to shower?

10:59.241 --> 11:01.277
No.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.657
You hungry?
I could get you...

11:06.791 --> 11:10.033
No, Maddy.
I don't need anything.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.515
Where's Nick?

11:28.771 --> 11:31.979
He ran off
like he always does.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.065
Any idea where?

11:35.194 --> 11:37.401
I think he's north.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.904
In Tijuana.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.739
Sorry.

11:46.872 --> 11:49.249
Where's Chris?

12:27.329 --> 12:29.411
I had no choice.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.706
Trav, where is he?

12:38.007 --> 12:40.840
Wake up.
Gotta go.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.384
What's going on?

12:47.516 --> 12:49.723
It's moving day,
is what's going on.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.719
- Why?
- We're all out of chickens.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.016
We should have been eating the eggs.
I told you that.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.605
I'm gonna be honest
with you, teach,

12:56.734 --> 12:59.146
your schoolmarm shit's
is getting old.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.361
- So what about James?
- No, I'm good to go.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.198
- You sure?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.739
Okay, so a scale
of one to 10?

13:10.372 --> 13:12.499
- It's zero, man.
- He's better.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.616
- He's not ready.
- Dad.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.083
We only gave him a week.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.292
This isn't
the space shuttle.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.877
We're taking a ride
in a pickup.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.668
- Where?
- San Diego, like we planned.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.463
USA, baby.
USA.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.007
San Diego is burned.
We told you that.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.879
There's nothing more
there than here.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.474
- Yeah, that's bullshit.
- Chris, tell them what we saw.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.140
We never went
to San Diego.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.729
- Oh, for Christ's sake. - We never
landed there. Never saw anything.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.270
- It is gone.
- This isn't a debate, Travis.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.530
We're not debating this. We're packing up
the truck and we're leaving.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.238
Now, you can come, but you've got to stop
with all this yap, yap, yap.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.237
- We got to go.
- Right on.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.203
Now, let's roll.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.119
Yeah, let's go.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.639
Dad, we need a hand.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.592
Remember what
the date is?

15:38.729 --> 15:40.720
- What?
- The date.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.437
No.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.477
Dad, I lost track.
What does it matter?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.817
They're waiting on us.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.358
Well, you tell them
to sit and wait.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.339
- Grab a corner.
- Four corners, four of us.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.182
We'll lift him up,
slide him right in.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.926
Let's do this shit.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.364
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.326
Chris and I will
get in the back with him.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.864
Cool.
|'|| control the tunes.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.410
Like hell, you will.
It's driver's choice.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.419
Pad that down.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.163
See you, Mexico.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.812
This is no good.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.855
Stop the truck.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.354
Don't make them stop, please.
Don't make them stop the truck.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.787
Brandon!

17:24.752 --> 17:26.993
Stop the truck.
Brandon.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.913
Come on, Brandon.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.634
Stop the goddamn truck
or your friend dies.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.128
Anything?

17:37.264 --> 17:41.098
He's still here.
Just barely.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.012
Son of a bitch.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.227
We can't keep doing this.
Waiting.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.695
No, and I don't like it,

17:55.824 --> 17:58.440
but we've got to learn
from today.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.363
I don't see him
getting any better.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.407
We're gonna need
to come to terms with that.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.619
So what are we saying?

18:03.749 --> 18:06.616
Yeah, what are we saying?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.834
You wouldn't understand.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.827
The hell's
wrong with you?

18:10.964 --> 18:13.091
Huh? You're supposed
to be his friends.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.923
- Stop it.
- He's not getting better.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.713
He would if you'd
give him a chance.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.756
Jesus, you gave him a week.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.096
He's fighting
and we need to help him.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.341
I mean, give him some time
for his blood to clot up inside.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.557
That's what they do
in the hospitals.

18:24.686 --> 18:25.971
We're not in a hospital.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.595
Well, this is as good
as it gets.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.268
Look around.
Think about it.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.109
We can survive here
long enough for him to heal.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.399
We've been here
for a week.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.945
It's safe.
There's no infected.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.739
- Come on, guys, you can save James.
- He would understand.

18:42.871 --> 18:46.204
No, he is scared
to death of you guys.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.166
I'm starting to get why.

18:50.587 --> 18:51.918
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.086
Dad, what are you doing?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.460
Just stay away from him.

18:59.596 --> 19:02.963
Relax, bro.
He's not gonna do anything with it.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.012
- You're not gonna kill him.
- And you're not gonna kill us.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.858
What the hell?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.775
Why are you
doing this?

19:19.908 --> 19:22.024
I'm doing this
for you.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.097
What's with the gun?

19:48.228 --> 19:50.514
Your buddies,

19:50.647 --> 19:52.979
they want
to put you down.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.268
They're saying
that you'd understand.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.147
Why do you think I agreed
to get in the truck?

20:01.283 --> 20:03.114
I don't understand,
why kill you?

20:03.243 --> 20:05.484
Why not
just leave you here?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.533
Back down in the Sea or Cortez
we had a friend with us.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.917
Yeah, your friend
who got bitten, right?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.125
Yeah, Troy.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.746
You know, he was...

20:16.882 --> 20:19.123
he was sick and we were still
figuring shit out.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.760
We didn't know
how it worked.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.047
We didn't know what was gonna
end up happening to him.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.593
We knew there was no way
he was not gonna turn.

20:27.809 --> 20:31.176
Troy knew that,
so he made us promise

20:31.313 --> 20:34.146
not to let that
happen to him.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.185
And we didn't.

20:41.865 --> 20:44.481
No matter where we go,
it's the same story

20:44.618 --> 20:46.825
just different people.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.698
No, when the time came,
Troy got...

20:52.834 --> 20:54.961
he got spooked.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.920
I mean, he lost a nerve,
started begging us not to.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.788
Trying to get us to stop.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.416
Brandon was the one
that was supposed to be doing it,

21:02.552 --> 21:05.635
but he couldn't...
he couldn't pull the trigger.

21:07.474 --> 21:11.387
So I grabbed the gun,
I looked him in the eye,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.932
I said I was sorry.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.271
Figured that was
the least I can do.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.652
Then he was gone.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.911
This is different.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.665
You're not sick.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.004
- What do you call this?
- You're not dying.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.499
You're gonna get better.
All you need is time.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.921
No, it doesn't matter.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.431
What matters is
they think I'm dying.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.008
That's the deal.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.310
I'm dead weight.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.972
- Yeah?
- It's me.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.526
- What do you want?
- To talk.

22:48.658 --> 22:51.365
And I thought you might
be hungry, so I brought you some food.

22:54.831 --> 22:58.198
It's not much,
but did my best.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.075
Set it down.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.669
Arms up.
Turn around.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.542
- I'm not carrying.
- Just do it.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.384
You don't trust me?

23:10.514 --> 23:14.052
I want to. You have no idea
how much I want to.

23:14.184 --> 23:17.096
- Where are the others?
- Down the road.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.890
There was a waystead.
They went to take care of it.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.637
They headed this way?

23:20.774 --> 23:23.766
No. Maybe.
I don't know, Dad. They were bored.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.478
Sit down.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.704
Look,L”
| just want to say, Dad,

23:38.834 --> 23:41.450
that | get it.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.749
Oh, you get it?

23:44.881 --> 23:47.588
What is it
that you get?

23:48.969 --> 23:51.130
What you're trying
to teach me.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.175
I mean, you don't
even like James.

23:54.307 --> 23:56.684
No, I don't, son.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.051
But you're still trying
to save him anyways.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.143
And why is that?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.480
Because his life
still matters.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.145
And we're not disposable.

24:10.365 --> 24:13.823
I mean, they've known
James since he was, like, six years old

24:13.952 --> 24:16.364
and they're still
gonna kill him.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.612
Imagine what they'll do
to me if anything happens, Dad.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.535
No, I'm gonna
get us out of here.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.533
Okay?

24:23.670 --> 24:25.410
Everything's gonna
be okay.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.583
Okay.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.298
I promise you.
I promise you.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.593
- You guys! You guys!
- Chris, what are you doing?

24:36.099 --> 24:37.964
Chris, what the hell?

24:39.686 --> 24:41.051
- Let me go.
- I got him.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.099
Shut up!

24:43.231 --> 24:45.347
No. No, man.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.902
Brandon.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.567
- Just don't do this.
- I'm sorry, bro.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.610
- Leave him with me.
- Look, I can get better.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.279
Just give me
a little more time. I promise.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.912
- Brandon, don't!
- Shut up!

24:58.038 --> 25:00.575
- I'm begging you, man.
- Both of you.

25:00.707 --> 25:04.040
Chris, don't let
them do this.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.251
Show me mercy

25:53.802 --> 25:56.088
Chris.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.927
Can we talk
for a second?

25:59.766 --> 26:01.631
Yeah, come here.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.975
- He's not coming with.
- He knows.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.064
- Elias.
- Who's that?

26:13.196 --> 26:15.983
The farmer.
His name was Elias Suarez.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.823
Born 1961,
February 12.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.739
That's your birthday.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.578
You said we shouldn't be
surprised by coincidences.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.699
This is forever, Chris.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.167
You drive away,
I won't be able to find you.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.129
You're barely 16 years old.
Don't do this.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.088
Dad, what do you
want me to do?

26:34.217 --> 26:35.878
Stay with you?

26:36.011 --> 26:37.876
- We were doing fine on our own.
- Were we?

26:38.013 --> 26:41.380
Yeah, we can.
Now I can walk, we can.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.219
Dad, your way,
it doesn't work.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.471
ltcant

26:49.608 --> 26:52.975
Chris, I promised your mother
that I would take care of you.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.942
And you are.

26:55.071 --> 26:56.572
What?

26:56.698 --> 26:58.734
By letting me go,
you are.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.199
Dad, you won't do
what needs to be done.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.532
I'm better off without you.

27:04.664 --> 27:07.531
Look, this whole time you
had me thinking I was broken.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.953
But I wasn't.
I'm not.

27:10.086 --> 27:13.795
l was just--
I was adapting.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.299
I'm good now.

27:15.425 --> 27:18.838
I am begging you
not to do this, Chris.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.261
Want to know
the funny part?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.598
With Mom, you did it.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.467
What did I do?

27:27.604 --> 27:29.435
You found it in you

27:29.564 --> 27:31.100
to do what needs
to be done.

27:31.232 --> 27:33.814
And then you lost it.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.730
Chris, you have got
it all backwards.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.195
There is a difference.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.235
Not anymore.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.654
- Let's roll.
- See ya, Pops.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.030
You all good, bro?

27:48.166 --> 27:49.952
Take me home.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.700
It's not too late.
I'm begging you, Chris.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.747
- I'm sorry.
- Chris.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.120
Come on.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.957
Get out of the truck.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.880
Chris.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.755
Chris!

28:04.891 --> 28:07.132
God damn you, Chris!

29:14.711 --> 29:16.997
What are the chances?

29:17.130 --> 29:18.461
Of?

29:19.924 --> 29:22.210
Two days,
I'm walking

29:22.343 --> 29:24.379
trying to find
my way to the ocean.

29:24.512 --> 29:28.175
And when I do
finally see the water...

29:29.726 --> 29:32.513
| see the hotel

29:32.645 --> 29:35.637
lit up like a goddamn
beacon and it's you.

29:35.648 --> 29:36.899
lit up like a goddamn
beacon and it's you.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.184
We got lucky.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.436
Did we?

29:44.032 --> 29:45.818
What are you saying?

29:45.950 --> 29:48.566
|f| hadn't
seen that light...

29:50.330 --> 29:52.787
I never would have
had to tell a soul what I did.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.705
Travis, you didn't
do anything wrong.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.416
I left him.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.840
Baby, come here.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.381
You need to listen
to me, okay?

30:07.514 --> 30:10.096
He was my son
and I left him.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.884
We're gonna get
through this.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.685
We're gonna get
through it.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.277
I failed him, Maddy.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.530
I failed him
and I failed her.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.708
You said it
yourself, Travis. You said it.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.881
He didn't leave you
any choice.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.091
I could have
gone along with it.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.757
Let them kill James.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.504
Would have been
the wrong thing to do,

30:51.641 --> 30:53.302
but I would have done
right by my son.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.853
He's still out there.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.724
He is.
You got to believe that.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.865
That night
at the vineyard...

31:10.994 --> 31:12.359
Oh, don't.

31:12.495 --> 31:14.281
l was wrong.
I was.

31:14.414 --> 31:17.622
He threatened Alicia.
He threatened your daughter.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.832
I regret saying that.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.622
No, you were right.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.460
Before you and l
were a family,

31:23.590 --> 31:25.581
Liza, Chris, and l,
we were a family.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.709
So all that "they're our children"
shit I was spewing,

31:28.845 --> 31:30.460
- that was naive.
- Travis.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.462
You and l
were parents first.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.591
And your responsibility
that night was to Alicia

31:35.602 --> 31:36.808
And your responsibility
that night was to Alicia

31:36.936 --> 31:38.676
and you were doing what
you were supposed to do.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.520
My responsibility
was to Chris.

31:46.070 --> 31:49.437
And I promised her
I would protect him.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.363
I know.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.455
The whole way walking here,
you know what I thought?

32:01.711 --> 32:05.295
| forgot to tell him
I loved him.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.962
The second
he was too far away,

32:11.095 --> 32:14.713
I realized the last thing
I said to him was,

32:14.849 --> 32:18.262
"God damn you."

32:18.394 --> 32:20.385
That's the last thing
his father said to him.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.308
That's the last thing
he'll remember.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.858
You didn't know him
when he was little,

32:27.987 --> 32:31.730
but he had
this huge heart.

32:31.866 --> 32:35.324
He was such a good boy.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.614
I know.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.614
When you met him
he was already so angry.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.583
At me, Liza.

32:43.711 --> 32:46.669
We took away his family.
He lost his place.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.540
He lost...
he had no place.

32:49.676 --> 32:53.134
I loved him.
I never stopped.

32:53.262 --> 32:56.720
All he saw
was my disgust

32:56.849 --> 32:59.761
at what he turned into,
what I let him become.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.009
It is, it's all
he'll ever know.

33:01.145 --> 33:04.182
- He knew.
- No.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.064
No.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.229
It was true then,
but now, I don't...

33:11.364 --> 33:15.277
- What? Tell me.
- We're all living minute by minute here.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.777
Every single one of us. And at the drop
of a hat, it could all be done.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.905
You won't have a chance.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.251
ljust wish I told him,
that's all.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.173
l have to find Alicia.

34:16.512 --> 34:18.093
- Andrés.
- We had to let them in.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.883
43 of them.

34:21.642 --> 34:23.803
We don't have enough
for nearly half.

34:23.936 --> 34:26.803
This is bad.
I've seen maybe a third of them.

34:26.939 --> 34:30.181
Once I've examined everyone,
we'll work in shifts, come up with a plan.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.229
Decide who's safe
and who's not.

34:32.361 --> 34:34.818
And then what to do
with those who aren't.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.483
Where's Alicia?

34:36.616 --> 34:37.981
This isn't a bite.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.399
I can see that.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.568
You can lower your shirt now.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.953
I've been hit with a nightstick.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.988
It's alright. lbelieve you.

34:46.667 --> 34:47.656
Thank you.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.117
/ am sorry.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.466
Is he okay?

34:57.595 --> 34:58.960
He'll be okay.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.758
Can you come with me?

35:13.986 --> 35:16.477
Mom?

35:16.614 --> 35:18.821
There's something
I didn't say last night.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.861
Something I need
you to understand.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.077
You don't need
to say anything.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.117
I understand.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.036
No, you don't.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.669
Okay? You can't.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.582
So just hear
me out, okay?

35:34.715 --> 35:36.455
Okay.

35:36.592 --> 35:38.378
It's about your father.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.721
His accident...

35:45.935 --> 35:47.846
it wasn't an accident.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.811
What?

35:54.944 --> 35:57.811
ljust... I thought
I was doing the right thing

35:57.947 --> 36:00.734
by not telling you. I didn't know.
I just... I didn't know what...

36:00.867 --> 36:03.028
You told me
he fell asleep.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.570
He didn't.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.572
Mom.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.450
I'm sorry.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.209
Are you sure?

36:17.341 --> 36:19.798
I wouldn't tell you
if I wasn't.

36:19.927 --> 36:22.339
He crashed his car.

36:22.471 --> 36:25.429
How can you
possibly be certain if you don't know...

36:25.558 --> 36:28.015
There was a note.
He left a note.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.472
They found it
in his glove box.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.867
What did it say?

36:51.000 --> 36:54.584
- It's not important.
- It's not important?

36:54.712 --> 36:58.045
Baby, he was a man
of few words, okay?

36:58.174 --> 37:01.166
And he could be quite
precise if he wanted to.

37:01.177 --> 37:03.042
And he could be quite
precise if he wanted to.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.551
Tell me.

37:17.360 --> 37:21.148
"I love you all...

37:21.280 --> 37:23.612
but enough's enough."

37:25.034 --> 37:27.696
And that's it?

37:27.828 --> 37:30.080
Yeah.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.925
What about Nick?
Does Nick know?

37:49.058 --> 37:50.844
No.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.059
Nick is the reason why.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.472
Why what?

37:54.605 --> 37:56.982
Why I kept
it a secret.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.066
There's so much
of your father in Nick, you know?

38:00.194 --> 38:03.027
The way he
could light up a room with his smile.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.866
Or silence it
with his mood.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.361
It's impossible
to ignore.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.786
You just couldn't
notseeit

38:20.589 --> 38:22.045
Hold my hand.

38:32.059 --> 38:35.927
I was always so afraid
of Nick ending up like him that I...

38:36.063 --> 38:37.519
It's okay.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.811
No, you deserve better.
You deserve more.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.025
So much more.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.190
But you have to know
that I never...

38:45.323 --> 38:48.565
I never ever loved you
anyless.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.817
Not ever.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.488
I just thought
you were all right.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.412
I had to be.

38:59.545 --> 39:01.251
I'm sorry.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.214
I know.

39:06.385 --> 39:08.341
I'm so, so sorry.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.772
I love you, too.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.115
Thank you.

40:07.905 --> 40:08.769
Hello!
