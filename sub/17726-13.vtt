- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:04.272 --> 00:06.040
- Thank you, everyone,
for coming to the roast

00:06.074 --> 00:07.341
of Jax Taylor.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.676
[cheers and applause]

00:08.709 --> 00:10.978
- I mean, he's slept with many--
- Son of a bitch.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.115
- Many, many women
and a few men.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.050
[group yelling]
- Oh...

00:16.084 --> 00:18.386
- Before we get married,
I think we should probably

00:18.419 --> 00:19.520
get a prenup.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.954
It's not an expression
of doubt at all.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.156
- I mean, I hadn't, like,
thought about it, but,

00:22.190 --> 00:23.691
like, I'm not against prenups.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.659
- I wanna come
kiss you right now.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.661
- Lala's just fallen off
the face of the Earth.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.430
- I have not heard from her.
- I mean, she hasn't shown up

00:29.463 --> 00:31.665
for her shifts.
She hasn't called in.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.535
- You know, like, me and James,
a month ago, we hooked up.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.304
- A month ago?
A few days ago,

00:36.337 --> 00:39.373
they just celebrated
their six-month anniversary.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.175
- Don't trust him.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.612
[Dena Deadly's
"Raise Your Glass"]

00:44.645 --> 00:48.382
- * You know
that it's our time *

00:48.416 --> 00:50.518
* These are the best days

00:50.551 --> 00:53.287
* Of our lives

00:53.321 --> 00:57.091
* Just raise
your glasses high *

00:57.125 --> 01:01.695
* This one's
for you tonight *

01:03.964 --> 01:07.268
* Goes around
comes back around *

01:07.301 --> 01:11.939
* Goes around comes around
goes around comes back around *

01:11.972 --> 01:14.142
- Hey, Wesley.
- Hello.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.310
- I've got Tom and Ariana
coming in a minute.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.411
- Okay.
- I want to go over

01:17.445 --> 01:18.812
all the cocktails.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:18.846 --> 01:23.050
- And I want them to show you
everything we do in Sur...

01:23.151 --> 01:25.386
- Okay.
- And everything we do in Pump.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.388
Hello, here they are,
on time.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.956
That's unusual for you,
Sandoval.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.391
[laughter]

01:30.424 --> 01:32.926
I'm always jumping from
one restaurant to the other.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.027
So you like that?

01:34.061 --> 01:35.729
I love that color.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.531
Sometimes it's
the flowers at Pump.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.700
Sometimes
it's the menus at Sur,

01:39.733 --> 01:41.502
and today it's the cocktails
at Villa Blanca.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.070
What's the first cocktail
we're gonna go with?

01:43.171 --> 01:46.907
- Let's do the Sur Cosmo first.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.610
The Sur Cosmo,
it's three limes wedges

01:49.643 --> 01:51.312
muddled into simple syrup.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.080
Shake it and strain.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.915
I've been working for Lisa
for seven years.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.650
- I'll do a Pump and Glory.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.420
You would muddle
cucumber with mint.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.422
- If Lisa needs to teach
somebody how to make

02:01.455 --> 02:04.292
her drinks the right way...

02:04.325 --> 02:05.393
- Do a rocks blast.
- All right.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.994
- Strain it over ice.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.896
- I'm the one she calls.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.964
She definitely
doesn't call Jax.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.566
*

02:12.600 --> 02:14.935
- It's looking good, Wesley.
- It's looking good?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.770
- I mean, I prefer the color
a little bit deeper.

02:16.804 --> 02:21.275
- The cranberry here is
a little less red than ours.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.311
- Do you know any
of the guys over there?

02:23.344 --> 02:25.413
- James has been here.
I've waited on him.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.081
- Don't over-serve him.
- Okay, speaking of which,

02:28.115 --> 02:30.218
with James,
I'm actually going with him

02:30.218 --> 02:34.455
to do some hypnotherapy
to help control his emotions.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.224
- Ooh.
- Keep him off alcohol.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.625
He gets very emotional.
- What do you mean,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.760
help control his emotions?
- He gets worked up, and he--

02:39.793 --> 02:41.495
and he gets destructive.
You know what I mean?

02:41.529 --> 02:42.896
- Oh, yeah.
- He drinks too much.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.865
- I know those types.
- No, Tom, he drinks too much.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.767
I don't think James
needs hypnotherapy

02:46.800 --> 02:49.703
as much as he needs
less drinking.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.072
Tom Sandoval thinks
he can fix everything.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.074
Life's not that simple,
unfortunately.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.076
When he's sober,
he is a lot different.

02:56.109 --> 02:59.112
- He is, he is, definitely.
- He's always been great here.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.282
We--we have not had
an issue with him yet.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.417
- How many times
have you seen him in here?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.421
- Once.
- [laughs]

03:07.455 --> 03:10.258
- * Open your eyes and look at
what you have *

03:10.291 --> 03:11.759
* What you have

03:11.792 --> 03:15.429
* You gotta love me
soon as you see who I am *

03:15.463 --> 03:18.266
- Hey, you.
- Hello.

03:18.266 --> 03:21.068
You look nice.
- Thank you.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.271
- How are you?
- Big boy. I'm very well.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.606
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.441
- Well, welcome.
- Thank you.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.109
- So here I have
our cocktail menu.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.177
- Arnold Palmer.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.412
- In case you guys
are interested.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.746
- For both.
- Yeah, we'll take two of those.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.081
- Oh, well, there you go,
and I'll go grab that,

03:34.114 --> 03:35.383
give you a minute
to look over the menu.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.584
- Dealing with my parents
like breaking up

03:36.617 --> 03:38.819
has just been really hard
for me, you know?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.321
And I haven't really been
talking to my mom

03:40.354 --> 03:41.789
as much as I should be lately.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.391
You know, I've been kind of
avoiding her

03:43.424 --> 03:45.326
just over everything
that's going on.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.594
- What have you been up to?

03:46.627 --> 03:50.531
- Just life, you know, I mean...
- Do I want to know?

03:50.564 --> 03:55.436
- Let me, ugh, let me explain
this in a way which works.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.539
A lot of little things
make a pie.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.341
A lot of slices
make a whole pie,

04:00.374 --> 04:01.342
you know what I mean?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.411
I feel like Lisa
had enough slices.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.546
- And, okay,
she's all pied out.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.615
- I got "pied"
from Sur and Pump.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.685
James.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.686
Why?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.021
I wanna know why.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.856
- You know, there was just
a night where I was, like,

04:15.889 --> 04:18.626
swearing in the restaurant.
- That's new.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.329
- You come to Pump
every f---ing time.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.397
- It's not your house.
Not your house.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.866
- He's drunk.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.101
- Well, there's jealousy,
so people have to understand.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.537
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know, at the end

04:29.570 --> 04:30.604
of the day, people are jealous.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.440
- I'm definitely
a threat to some people,

04:32.473 --> 04:34.375
but I have gotten
a new residency at a new place

04:34.408 --> 04:35.976
at The Redbury Hotel.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.978
It's summer school
with James Kennedy.

04:38.011 --> 04:41.549
- That's nice.
- And my first live performance

04:41.582 --> 04:43.351
where I'm on the stage rapping.
- [gasps]

04:43.351 --> 04:44.685
Could we come?
- Yeah.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.420
- I would love to.
- Okay.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.688
- Yeah?
Is that all right?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.557
Fun, definitely.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.625
- So you know,
things with Raquel

04:51.659 --> 04:53.727
are going really well.
- I love her.

04:53.761 --> 04:57.264
I think she's just--
a light shines from inside.

04:57.365 --> 05:00.100
- I've met the love of my life,
the most amazing girl

05:00.133 --> 05:01.835
in the world that I think
I've ever met.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.037
I always miss you when I don't
see you even for like a day.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.707
- I miss you too.
- Aw, and I love you.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.075
- Yeah, I love you.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.210
- I could bring models home
every night if I want to,

05:10.243 --> 05:11.745
but I'm not gonna do that.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.014
I'm gonna commit
to my girlfriend Raquel,

05:14.047 --> 05:15.816
and she makes it all worth it.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.886
Kristen started talking sh--
about me to everyone,

05:18.919 --> 05:22.490
saying how I cheat on Raquel
all the time, blah, blah, blah.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.858
- The girl needs a life.
She's got none.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.026
- It's sad.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.195
- You know what
her karma's gonna be?

05:28.228 --> 05:29.830
She's not gonna
be able to have kids.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.632
- Ohh--

05:31.665 --> 05:33.734
- She's probably barren.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.936
I know it's a bitchy thing
to say, but you know what?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.304
That's gonna be her karma.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.072
- You know,
I'm my mom's first-born,

05:39.106 --> 05:40.974
you know, I'm her baby boy
for God's sakes.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.877
I mean, she's very protective
over me, and, you know,

05:43.911 --> 05:46.246
if a girl came at me,
my mom would probably

05:46.279 --> 05:47.715
try and knock her out.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.082
- Karma's gonna slap her
in the face,

05:49.116 --> 05:51.885
and she's lucky I never.
- Ohh!

05:51.919 --> 05:58.091
- * Even when the sky
is falling down *

05:58.125 --> 06:01.995
* We'll always
be together, baby *

06:02.029 --> 06:04.698
- Kingsley, I'm gonna miss you.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.000
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.570
Just put you
in a suitcase, yeah.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.439
- Oh...
- [laughs]

06:11.439 --> 06:13.441
I know.
I don't wanna go back.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.877
- I'm sad.
It was nice having you here.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.311
My mom is my best friend.

06:18.345 --> 06:21.014
I definitely wish that my mom
at least lived closer.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.150
I would love to see her
more if I could.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.553
- I'm just making sure
you're okay with everything.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.021
I know he done
all this before you.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.623
- So I was turned down.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.726
Thinking back on it,
it was the only time,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.495
in the two years
that we were together,

06:34.528 --> 06:36.096
that he turned a girl down.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.831
all: Ooh!

06:37.865 --> 06:39.567
[cheers and applause]

06:39.600 --> 06:43.103
- I think he's cheated on
about every girlfriend he's had.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.939
- I know he's
not cheated on me though, or...

06:45.973 --> 06:49.209
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.378
I'm with him
every step of the way.

06:51.479 --> 06:54.247
I come from
a very religious background.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.517
My mamal and papal,
they've never drank

06:56.550 --> 06:58.218
a sip of alcohol in their lives.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.021
If these things
were true about Jax,

07:01.054 --> 07:03.557
then my mom would feel
a little differently about him.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.325
I think she would maybe
want me to reconsider

07:05.358 --> 07:06.494
living here with him.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.895
- Still have some questions.
I really want to

07:07.928 --> 07:09.663
talk to him
about a couple things.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.499
- You can ask Jax
about that and have him

07:11.499 --> 07:12.566
explain that to you.
- Okay.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.034
- You gonna miss
little King-King?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.268
- Oh, I definitely am.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.005
I'll just take him home
in my suitcase.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.108
- Hello.
- Hi.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.411
*

07:24.512 --> 07:26.714
What did you bring?
- Groceries.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.650
Now that you're leaving,
we're on a health kick now.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.052
No more junk food.
No more eating out.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.353
- Good job, honey.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.422
- So what's going on?

07:35.523 --> 07:37.591
- She just packed up
her suitcase, and she's leaving.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.359
- It was great having you here.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.529
I'm glad you could
share my birthday with me.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.932
[clap clap]

07:44.965 --> 07:47.100
Oh.
- Daddy's here.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.236
- So are you all calling me
an Uber tonight?

07:49.269 --> 07:51.271
- Yeah, 'cause we're--
- Yeah, I wish I could take you

07:51.304 --> 07:52.840
to the airport, I really do,
but I can't.

07:52.873 --> 07:53.974
I have to work.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.743
But it's just as nice.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.912
I love having Sherri here,
but the second she's gone

07:58.946 --> 08:00.914
I'm taking my pants off,
I'm making hot wings

08:00.948 --> 08:02.816
in the microwave,
and I'm gonna watch SportsCenter

08:02.850 --> 08:03.951
from the sh---er.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.555
- Mom's gotta talk to you
about the roast.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.757
- Oh, what about it?

08:09.790 --> 08:12.459
- Something about you
being a homosexual or...

08:12.560 --> 08:15.295
- [laughs] That's just my
buddies just being stupid.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.099
As far as me being a homosexual,
I have nothing against it.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.335
I am not. I've never gone down
that road before.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.937
- But they were saying
that you were kissing

08:23.971 --> 08:25.673
John or something in Miami.
- I kissed John on the cheek.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.641
When he's coming in
for, like, say hi

08:27.675 --> 08:28.909
to my birthday,
I say, "Hey, how you doing?"

08:28.942 --> 08:30.611
I kiss a guy on the cheek.
Yeah, I've done that.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.713
I kiss my father on the cheek.
I kiss my father on the lips.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.615
- I know, but it's just
my mother asking you,

08:34.648 --> 08:35.849
'cause she's here.
- Okay, no, oh, no.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.250
- And she wants to know.
- I understand, no, I get it.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.318
I get it.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.486
If you wanna believe
what you wanna believe,

08:39.587 --> 08:41.188
that's fine,
but it didn't happen.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.291
You either take my word for it,
or you don't.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.059
- There's no need
to have attitude.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.194
- Okay.
- Seriously, I cannot stand

08:47.227 --> 08:48.762
that tone of voice,
especially when

08:48.796 --> 08:50.297
you're speaking to my mother.
- All right, if you're gonna

08:50.330 --> 08:51.999
attack me, then I'm gonna leave.
- You're getting defensive.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.500
- I know. Like, why do you
get so defensive?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.335
- I don't--I don't--
- We're sitting here talking.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.970
- Because it's, like,
I've had this question

08:57.004 --> 08:58.438
asked to me before,
and this is like--

08:58.471 --> 09:00.107
- Okay, but my mom
has never heard it before,

09:00.140 --> 09:01.675
and she's asking you a question.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.276
There's no need
to have attitude.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.012
Typical Jax.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.780
Do not be rude to me
in front of my mother.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.049
I just can't even--
I cannot stand him right now.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.619
There's no need
to get defensive.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.621
- Well, don't attack me
for no reason.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.355
- No one's attacking you.
- Some--I'll say things--

09:15.388 --> 09:16.924
- You're just being defensive
over something that--

09:16.957 --> 09:19.192
- Okay, well, I'm gonna go.
- Okay--bye.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.761
- Bye.
- That was ridiculous.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.730
- Why don't I sit here and tell
your mother how many times--

09:22.763 --> 09:24.397
how--what I've done
for you since you've been here,

09:24.431 --> 09:25.899
the whole year
you've been here, okay?

09:25.933 --> 09:28.702
Sitting on the couch for a year,
while I take care of you.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.137
[door slams]

09:32.539 --> 09:34.207
- Is it okay
if we wear a black vest?

09:34.241 --> 09:36.710
- Uh, I would prefer
you didn't.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.111
- Okay.

09:43.651 --> 09:43.917
- [sighs]

09:44.852 --> 09:46.720
[quietly]
Jesus.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.521
Sorry, Mom,
that he acted that way.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.925
*

09:51.959 --> 09:54.027
That's not okay.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.563
He needs to come back in
and apologize.

09:56.664 --> 09:59.933
Jax doesn't like to think that
he ever does anything wrong.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.670
So instead of him taking
responsibility for his actions,

10:02.703 --> 10:04.672
he tries
to turn things around on me

10:04.705 --> 10:07.975
and tries to make me
look like the bad guy.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.678
- What now?
- Well, I just want you to talk

10:10.711 --> 10:12.846
to Mom so that things--
She's leaving today.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.247
- This is fine.
It's between you and me.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.116
- Well, I just feel bad--
- You and I, sorry.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.251
- That she's sitting here
watching me and you argue

10:18.285 --> 10:19.586
with each other
over something so stupid.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.656
- You need to learn
to pick and choose your battles.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.591
- I'm just gonna get ready.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.459
- I apologize that you
had to see that,

10:26.493 --> 10:29.897
but sometimes she needs
to realize what she has.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.932
- I just want
you all to be happy.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.333
- We're happy.
We are happy.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.636
She just needs to--
[sighs]

10:36.670 --> 10:40.440
I feel like I just--maybe I
just--I do too much sometimes.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.109
I don't ask
for anything in return.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.343
I don't want anything.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.412
I just ask
let me do what I wanna do.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.581
- When have I ever not let you
do what you want to do?

10:48.615 --> 10:49.616
- Don't come out
and dig at me.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.818
I mean, you want
to start arguing with me.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.252
- When have I ever
not let you do something?

10:52.285 --> 10:53.754
- When you want to start
an argument with me--

10:53.787 --> 10:55.388
- Just because you're mad
right now, don't, like,

10:55.422 --> 10:56.924
try to act like that
I don't thank you

10:56.957 --> 10:58.892
and I'm not thankful
or I'm not grateful,

10:58.926 --> 11:00.928
because that's not my character,
and that's not who I am.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.596
- Then don't argue with me.
- You all can do this later,

11:03.630 --> 11:07.367
but it's making me
very uncomfortable, so...

11:07.400 --> 11:09.036
- She was never like this
until she started

11:09.069 --> 11:12.039
hanging around these girls,
and that's the problem.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.741
- Yeah, I think she's
still the same girl

11:13.741 --> 11:16.309
from Winchester, Kentucky,
so...

11:16.343 --> 11:17.510
- Sorry.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.879
- Well, maybe if you'll
just get involved and go

11:18.912 --> 11:20.480
to the little church
like I've been trying

11:20.513 --> 11:23.483
to get you to, then--
- I do, maybe I do need Jesus.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.785
- Yes.
- I--maybe, you know what?

11:24.818 --> 11:26.119
Maybe you're right.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.955
God sakes, I need something.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.624
- * Fast pace
of perfect faces *

11:31.658 --> 11:37.264
* L.A., you're chasing

11:37.297 --> 11:39.432
- Hey, so, Victor,
I know what we're doing here.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.669
So let's use this, the roller.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.504
I've done this before.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.910
Me likey.
- Yeah.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.578
- I think we're gonna
go with this.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.882
See, this is why
I get paid the big bucks, Peter.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.417
I like to make every decision
when it comes to my restaurant

11:57.450 --> 11:59.386
about the aesthetic.

11:59.419 --> 12:03.791
Nobody does this job
better than me.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.693
- The bridesmaids are having,
like, another bridesmaid meeting

12:06.794 --> 12:08.661
today that I'm not a part of.
[laughs]

12:08.695 --> 12:11.899
I don't know if that's, like,
that's how usually things roll.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.533
I just know,
with my bridal shower,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.803
Scheana came up to me
and said that Kristen

12:15.836 --> 12:18.005
got mad at her
'cause she didn't pay, like,

12:18.038 --> 12:21.074
the several hundred dollars
for my bridal shower,

12:21.108 --> 12:23.110
and I was like--
- Ooh, wow.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.145
- Okay, that's
none of your business.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.546
That's their job.
- That's why I'm like,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.648
do I, like, get involved

12:28.681 --> 12:31.284
with the, you know,
bachelorette stuff?

12:31.318 --> 12:33.253
With everything I have
going on in my life,

12:33.286 --> 12:35.488
I have relinquished control
of planning

12:35.522 --> 12:37.390
the bachelorette party
and where we'll be going

12:37.424 --> 12:40.093
to my bridesmaids,
but with all the fighting

12:40.127 --> 12:41.829
going on now,
I'm not really sure

12:41.862 --> 12:43.496
that was the best idea.

12:43.530 --> 12:47.100
- My advice to you is there are,
like, all these women

12:47.134 --> 12:49.169
that you trust and you love
in your life.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.304
Then you give them
total responsibility

12:51.338 --> 12:52.840
and let them organize it.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.275
However, in your case,
I would get really involved.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.211
[laughter]

12:58.245 --> 13:01.281
[upbeat music]

13:01.314 --> 13:04.852
*

13:04.852 --> 13:06.186
- Hey, how's it going?

13:06.219 --> 13:07.855
- How's it going, man?
MJ, nice to meet you.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.522
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Tom, nice to meet you.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.958
- Hey there, I'm Jax.
- I brought my

13:10.991 --> 13:13.426
soon-to-be groomsmen with me--
- Ariana, nice to meet you.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.727
- Including her.
- Pleasure, welcome.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.164
We do slim fit, so--
and we do have small sizes.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.231
- Okay.
- Slim fits are what

13:18.265 --> 13:20.000
we all want.
- Oh, oh, yeah.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.468
- You need an athletic fit,
man.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.904
- What?
- Hey, he's sensitive.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.173
I'm not making a lot
of decisions for the wedding,

13:26.206 --> 13:27.574
but I am making a few.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.043
Now, me, I'm gonna be wearing
a custom-tailored suit

13:30.077 --> 13:31.444
from my friend George.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.013
It's gonna
be forest green,

13:33.046 --> 13:35.748
black to go along
with our woodsy elegance theme.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.451
And then the groomsmen
are gonna be wearing all black,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.988
and then they're gonna have
the green tie to match my suit.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.223
It needs to be perfect.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.527
- What about tuxes?
- Then you can't wear a tux

13:47.560 --> 13:48.896
if I'm wearing a tux.
- Why?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.430
- Only the groom.
- You really wanna make

13:50.463 --> 13:51.731
the groom stand out
more than everybody.

13:51.764 --> 13:52.900
- Yeah,
- Yeah, don't tell

13:52.900 --> 13:54.534
Sandoval that.
- I know.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.004
- Look at you.
- You look like a groomsman.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.072
- Is it okay
if we wear a black vest?

13:59.106 --> 14:03.010
- Uh, I would prefer you didn't.
- Okay.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.078
- It's your wedding, man.
- Don't look sad.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.513
[laughter]

14:06.546 --> 14:08.315
Dude, don't cry.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.418
We can get vests.
[laughter]

14:11.451 --> 14:13.586
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.755
- See, it's like Stassi.
All I have to do is cry.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.524
- [laughs]

14:17.557 --> 14:19.359
- Old Stassi.
- Uh-huh.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.360
- Yep.
- I don't think

14:20.393 --> 14:22.930
there's a difference.
[laughs]

14:22.963 --> 14:25.765
- * Can't stop, won't stop

14:25.798 --> 14:27.935
* I love it

14:27.935 --> 14:29.169
* I love it

14:29.202 --> 14:32.505
* I-I-I love it...

14:32.539 --> 14:33.673
- It's so hot.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.375
- Did you guys
wanna order drinks?

14:35.408 --> 14:36.643
- Yes.
[overlapping chatter]

14:36.676 --> 14:39.146
- A large Nigori.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.313
- Can I get water
with lemon, please?

14:40.347 --> 14:41.548
- Sure.
- And yeah, waters all around

14:41.581 --> 14:42.749
with lemon.
- Yeah.

14:42.782 --> 14:46.853
- Oh, Kristen, before I forget,
the money I owe you.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.355
- For what?
- For the rest

14:48.388 --> 14:50.490
of the bridal shower
and for the shoes.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.392
- Oh, okay.
- Which, I figured,

14:52.425 --> 14:53.860
you'd prefer cash, so...

14:53.961 --> 14:55.828
Kristen wants
to bitch about $500?

14:55.862 --> 14:57.430
You know what,
I'm gonna put your f---ing money

14:57.464 --> 14:58.665
in an envelope,
and I'm gonna hand it to you

14:58.698 --> 15:00.700
in front of everyone else
so you shut the f--- up.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.535
- So let me tell you guys
what happened today.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.971
- What?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.672
- We were just talking about,
like, the roast and everything,

15:05.705 --> 15:08.241
of course, 'cause my mom had a
couple questions about, like,

15:08.275 --> 15:11.544
Jax kissing a man, and he was,
like, really defensive

15:11.578 --> 15:12.845
and had a really bad attitude.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.714
- Being mean
to somebody's parents, there's--

15:14.747 --> 15:16.183
That's a line
that you can't cross.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.684
Like, that is infuriating.
- Even if your mom

15:17.717 --> 15:18.851
did something wrong.

15:18.885 --> 15:19.987
- I can relate
to what Brittany's

15:20.020 --> 15:21.154
talking about right now.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.990
He used to fight with me
in front of my parents

15:23.023 --> 15:24.124
all the time.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.625
I'd almost rather
be cheated on.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.793
I know what
will cheer you up.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.661
We can talk about
the bachelorette party.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.896
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

15:29.997 --> 15:32.132
- Okay, well,
nobody's making decisions,

15:32.165 --> 15:33.700
so we all need to, like--
- Meaning Schwartz mostly.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.268
- Yeah.
- Vegas is out.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.504
I just know Katie wanted to do
something, like, by the water.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.106
- I feel like it would be
really fun to do New Orleans.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.707
I would know exactly
where to take you guys.

15:40.740 --> 15:44.911
It's so cheap, where it's
like Vegas except better.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.247
- So I just text Tom, I say,
"Hey-o, I'm with

15:47.280 --> 15:48.381
"the bridesmaids at lunch.
What do you think

15:48.415 --> 15:50.917
about New Orleans?
Vegas is not an option."

15:51.018 --> 15:52.152
[laughter]

15:52.185 --> 15:53.553
[phone buzzes]

15:53.586 --> 15:56.023
- You guys, I just got
a text from Doute now.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.091
They're--I guess all
the bridesmaids are at lunch.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.094
I don't f---ing know where
to go for the bachelor party.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.296
- Let's just do Vegas.
- Yeah, what about Vegas?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.398
- I would love to do Vegas,
but they literally--

16:05.432 --> 16:08.935
In capital letters it says
"Vegas is not an option."

16:09.036 --> 16:11.038
- What about the Bahamas?
- Well, that's an option.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.840
[phone buzzes]
- Schwartz just text me.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.775
"We like Bahamas."

16:15.808 --> 16:16.876
Does everyone
have their passport?

16:16.909 --> 16:17.877
- No.
- I do.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.279
- Oh.
- Mine's not in yet.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.481
- Okay, so we can't do
the Bahamas.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.950
- I mean, I've always wanted
to take all of you guys

16:24.051 --> 16:26.153
to New Orleans.
- I just want it to be like

16:26.186 --> 16:28.355
a collective trip
where we each maybe plan, like,

16:28.388 --> 16:29.589
a certain thing.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.058
No offense but, like,
if we're in New Orleans,

16:31.058 --> 16:33.160
I just feel like you're
gonna take over the whole thing.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.096
- Um, why wouldn't I
be planning this trip,

16:36.129 --> 16:37.764
if we're going to New Orleans?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.732
I'm the only one here
that's from New Orleans

16:39.766 --> 16:41.168
and knows everything about it.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.936
But if we were gonna
go to vacation to Azusa,

16:43.970 --> 16:45.738
then I would expect you
to f---ing plan it.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.074
[laughter]

16:47.107 --> 16:48.608
That's just bottom line.
That's what it is.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.278
I'm not planning it just because
I wanna do what I wanna do.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.845
I wanna pla--
'cause I know everything.

16:52.879 --> 16:53.913
- Yeah.
- I know what she'll

16:53.946 --> 16:55.215
like to do.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.117
What I'm asking all of you guys
is if you wanna, like,

16:57.150 --> 16:58.485
research everything
about New Orleans

16:58.518 --> 17:00.687
that you wouldn't wanna do,
and then you can tell me

17:00.720 --> 17:02.189
and I can--
- She's basically

17:02.222 --> 17:03.923
the unofficial maid of honor.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.659
- Last year, Stassi was begging
just for the chance

17:06.693 --> 17:10.130
to talk to Katie,
and now she's back, full-force,

17:10.163 --> 17:13.166
steamrolling everyone, just
making it all about herself,

17:13.200 --> 17:16.536
and it's like,
cool, Queen Stassi's back.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.937
Kill me.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.606
- Stassi, do you think
it's gonna be weird if Ariana

17:19.639 --> 17:21.408
is with us the whole time,
since you guys

17:21.441 --> 17:22.642
got into it the other day?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.711
- I don't feel awkward.
She should feel awkward

17:24.744 --> 17:26.579
for being mean.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.281
[phone buzzes]
- The tribe has spoken,

17:28.315 --> 17:29.916
but it seems like they're
leaning toward New Orleans

17:29.949 --> 17:31.451
'cause it's the easiest
to set up and it's--

17:31.484 --> 17:33.153
- The easiest, or is it because
Stassi lives there?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.587
- No, dude, come on.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.589
It's about who we're with,
and I'm gonna have

17:36.623 --> 17:39.592
a f---ing awesome groomsmen
squad, and then, you know--

17:39.626 --> 17:42.229
- Where do you want me to go?
- Wherever we go.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.964
- He said,
"Let's do this damn thing."

17:44.997 --> 17:47.134
And then he sent
three beers and a skull.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.268
- New Orleans it is.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.602
This is so exciting.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.771
- Great bridesmaids meeting.
Bridesmaids...

17:51.804 --> 17:53.140
all: Hoo-ha-ha.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.709
- Schwartz and Katie are meeting
with the lawyer right now

18:10.423 --> 18:12.659
- Oh, the smells.
Heavenly, right?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.161
Oh, my God,
it smells so good.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.962
Ooh, see this is nice.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.465
- Hi, how are you?
- Welcome to the Empty Vase.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.666
- Thank you.
Well, she's looking at things

18:19.699 --> 18:21.168
for her wedding.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.836
- I'm having our wedding flowers
be done by the local florist

18:23.870 --> 18:25.972
at the wedding venue,
but I don't really know

18:26.005 --> 18:29.376
what I want, so I'm hoping
Lisa can help curate

18:29.409 --> 18:32.412
some ideas and designs
for the flowers.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.981
- What's your budget
for flowers?

18:35.014 --> 18:37.917
- Um, I think we could
get away with something like,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.753
what, like 6.
- 6,000?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.222
- Again, yeah.
- That would be like a--

18:42.255 --> 18:44.424
that would be a definitely
a smaller event.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.294
- Okay, 'cause Tom
will lose himself.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.762
This makes me nervous
'cause he's like,

18:49.796 --> 18:51.931
"We just don't need flowers."
- He said you don't

18:51.964 --> 18:53.500
need flowers?
- Yeah.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.702
It's hard getting on
the same page with things

18:55.735 --> 18:57.304
sometimes with him, or--

18:57.337 --> 18:59.506
- Well, what was the argument
then the other day?

18:59.539 --> 19:02.209
- Mostly probably just 'cause we
both had been, like, drinking.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.211
First of all, you were
f---ing sh--faced last night.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.678
- So were you.
- Oh, my God.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.681
- You're such a bitch, dude.
Oh, my God, you're such a bitch.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.116
- When you say things
and they hurt

19:10.217 --> 19:11.618
or you text each other things,

19:11.651 --> 19:14.221
that's somewhere--
it stays there.

19:14.221 --> 19:17.123
Every time I see Katie,
she has some horror story

19:17.224 --> 19:19.592
of some conversation
she's had with Schwartzie.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.229
They're getting married
in a few weeks, for God's sake.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.331
It's kind of hard
to fathom really.

19:24.364 --> 19:27.600
Trust me, there's gonna be so
many things to fight about,

19:27.634 --> 19:30.837
like the outside world,
that you need to unite

19:30.870 --> 19:34.674

- I'm a little nervous,
to be honest, brah.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.785
- If anything,
you should be...relaxed.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.454
- Yeah, I'm not exactly
relaxed right now.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.988
- I've done hypnotism
before.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.625
It's all about getting you to be
the best version of yourself.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.160
- Right, right, right, yeah.
- Self improvement.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.929
Sometimes I feel like
what gets you in trouble

19:56.963 --> 20:01.200
is you reacting to things
before thinking about them.

20:01.200 --> 20:01.268
is you reacting to things
before thinking about them.
- Tom invited
this hypnotherapist

20:01.268 --> 20:02.935
- Tom invited
this hypnotherapist

20:02.969 --> 20:05.305
to come to my house
and do this session.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.406
Hello.
- Hi. James?

20:06.439 --> 20:07.907
- James, yes,
pleasure to meet you.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.809
- I'm Barbara, nice meeting you.
- Hi, Barbara, what's up?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.210
Come on in.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.346
He swears by it, and I'm
still a little bit skeptical.

20:13.380 --> 20:17.484
Last year, Kristen had me
doing crystal therapy.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.587
- What's great about stones is
that each stone has a meaning,

20:20.620 --> 20:23.155
and you obviously
know this is an Aquarius.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.957
I am humbled to be
in your energy.

20:24.991 --> 20:25.958
- [laughs]

20:25.992 --> 20:27.527
- You both are
highly intuitive people.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.828
You guys are tapped in.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.698
- But, hey, maybe
I'll f---ing wake up

20:31.731 --> 20:33.733
a changed man, who knows?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.368
When I'm not drinking,
and I'm around people,

20:35.402 --> 20:38.571
I'm a lot easier to be around.
- Yeah, alcohol

20:38.605 --> 20:40.507
is a catalyst for him.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.042
- That's what
we are working on you.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.379
You're the only one who can
make a change in yourself.

20:46.413 --> 20:50.350
The most important thing
is what do you want?

20:50.383 --> 20:55.121
- I wanna make a lot of music
and focus on showing others

20:55.154 --> 20:57.690
that, like at performances
and stuff,

20:57.724 --> 21:00.092
that I'm not
exactly a joke, you know?

21:00.126 --> 21:02.395
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, people tend to think,

21:02.429 --> 21:04.063
like, "Oh, James,
this British kid,"

21:04.096 --> 21:05.932
like, "hair perfect,
blah, blah, blah,

21:05.965 --> 21:07.367
thinks he can do this."

21:07.400 --> 21:10.570
I've got a big performance
coming up tomorrow night,

21:10.603 --> 21:13.940
actually,
at The Study on Hollywood.

21:13.973 --> 21:17.444
So I feel this feeling
to prove to others--

21:17.477 --> 21:19.346
Like I have this feeling
that I need proof--

21:19.346 --> 21:21.481
- Yeah.
- That I am good at what I do.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.516
- Those pe--sorry, to interrupt,
but those people

21:23.550 --> 21:24.951
are f---ing trolls.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.387
I feel like James
is always the underdog.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.821
- And one,

21:28.855 --> 21:30.189
and zero.
[snaps]

21:30.222 --> 21:31.658
Deep.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.859
- Under all that, like,

21:32.892 --> 21:35.662
cocky, annoying facade
that he puts on

21:35.695 --> 21:38.765
as a defense mechanism,
he's just, you know,

21:38.798 --> 21:40.166
he's a delicate guy.

21:40.199 --> 21:44.404
- The unconscious mind is here
and can hear me right now.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.772
I don't drink.

21:45.805 --> 21:50.176
I don't need to have that
to feel better.

21:50.209 --> 21:54.180
You are not going to allow
anyone or anything

21:54.213 --> 21:57.617
to prevent you from achieving
what you want.

21:57.650 --> 22:02.489
You have one direction,
and direction is forward.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.990
- Worst comes to worst,
it doesn't work

22:04.023 --> 22:05.392
and I got to have
a 20 minute nap,

22:05.392 --> 22:06.959
so, thanks, Tom.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.796

four, five, eyes open.

Relax, rejuvenated,
and full of resources

22:13.666 --> 22:15.301
in a very positive way.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.203
- We're done?
- Yeah.

- What did you say?
You said, like--what did I say?

22:20.873 --> 22:22.475
Did I say something?
- Nothing, no, no.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.812
- After this therapy session,
I just feel relaxed as hell.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.415

Like, do you do

22:48.935 --> 22:50.703
like jumps and stuff?
Do you just like--

22:50.737 --> 22:52.138
- Yeah, I do.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.441
I started riding horses
when I was six years old,

22:54.441 --> 22:57.276
and I got my first horse,
Raven, when I was eight.

22:57.309 --> 23:00.680
And she was more of a friend
to me than most people.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.849
Raven and I were the same age,

23:02.882 --> 23:07.520
and so I lost Raven
when I was 30 and she was 30,

23:07.554 --> 23:11.624
and so we were
together for 22 years.

23:13.526 --> 23:17.129
It's hard to explain
to someone who's not

23:17.163 --> 23:21.601
a horse person
the connection that rider

23:21.634 --> 23:23.470
and horse have with each other.

23:23.470 --> 23:26.072
- Those eyes are so big
and beautiful.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.240
- You're just constantly
taking care of each other

23:28.274 --> 23:30.076
and making sure
that the other one

23:30.109 --> 23:33.913
feels supported and loved.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.748

- How was this morning?

24:06.145 --> 24:09.048
- James got hypnotized.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.951
I think it was a really big step
for him today, actually.

24:11.984 --> 24:12.952
- Okay.
- Yeah.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.053
- He really started to grasp,

24:15.421 --> 24:17.824
of taking control
of situations that you're in.

- I think it's gonna take
a hell of a lot more

24:19.291 --> 24:22.228
than a hypnotist to cure James
of his mental ailments.

24:22.261 --> 24:25.865

is just disgusting.

like a chicken.

- He's not cured of drinking.

Power over your emotions.
- Yeah.

- 'Cause I'm telling you, like,
you guys should try it.

just stop acting like assholes.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.552
So, wait, you guys
have plans tonight, right?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.587
- We're supposed to go
to a painting class.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.888
- Yeah.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.322
- And it was supposed to be...
- Wine and paint.

24:50.356 --> 24:51.558
- A double date but...

24:51.591 --> 24:52.959
- Yeah, now it's a double date
with Stassi.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.060
- Now there's a third wheel?

24:54.093 --> 24:55.194
- That's a fifth wheel.
- Fifth wheel.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.395
- Fifth wheel, yeah.
- Yeah.

24:56.428 --> 24:59.365
- She's just not generally
my cup of tea.

24:59.398 --> 25:00.399
- Yeah.
- You know?

25:00.432 --> 25:01.901
I can--
I can be around her

25:01.934 --> 25:04.203
for short periods of time.
- Yeah.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.038
- In this particular
group of friends,

25:06.072 --> 25:08.641
I like the guys more
than I like these girls,

25:08.675 --> 25:11.043
but I like horses better
than I like any of 'em.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.312
- Schwartz and Katie are meeting
with the lawyer right now

25:13.345 --> 25:15.982
to actually do the prenup.
- What?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.817
That's just, for me,
personally--

25:17.850 --> 25:19.451
I mean,
I had joked with Shay

25:19.485 --> 25:20.887
that I was gonna make him
sign one, 'cause I was

25:20.920 --> 25:22.288
completely f---ing with him.
I would never

25:22.321 --> 25:25.091
even consider that.
If I'm marrying someone,

25:25.124 --> 25:26.458
I trust them.
- But when you get divorced,

25:26.492 --> 25:28.695
they can take half of it.
- Like, I married someone

25:28.728 --> 25:31.263
I trust.
- I know, but things happen.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.499
- Yeah, emotions run wild.
Trust me.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.703
- * Hope we last

25:36.736 --> 25:38.638
* I hope this lasts

25:38.671 --> 25:44.176
* I hope we last forever

25:44.210 --> 25:46.478
* Forever

25:46.512 --> 25:48.180
* Hope this lasts forever

25:48.214 --> 25:49.248
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.283
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.921
- [laughs]

25:54.954 --> 25:57.356
Did you get, like, a--
any kind of quote

25:57.389 --> 25:59.325
or anything about what
this consultation costs

25:59.358 --> 26:01.193
and for all the paperwork
to be filed?

26:01.227 --> 26:02.528
- Yeah.
- What--

26:02.629 --> 26:04.130
- It's so much more than
I thought it was gonna be.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.698
- What is it?

26:05.732 --> 26:06.699
- Like $2,000.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.200
- 2--
- $2,500.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.703
- So you're paying for it?
- [murmurs] Sure, yeah, yeah.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.705
- My, how the tables
have turned.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.741
Tom was complaining
about spending

26:14.774 --> 26:16.776
too much money
all summer long,

26:16.809 --> 26:21.013
and now we have to shell out
$2,500 for a prenup.

26:21.047 --> 26:24.651
I hope this is the last time
I hear Tom complaining

26:24.651 --> 26:27.654
about the cost of our wedding.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.155
- So...
- Yeah.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.723
- You're here for a prenup.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.358
- Well, yeah.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.661
- Okay, why don't we start
by you telling me

26:34.694 --> 26:36.028
what your assets are.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.664
- Well, I--we don't have
any property.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.132
We--we...
- You mean real property.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.200
Real estate.
- Yeah, we don't have

26:41.233 --> 26:43.202
any real estate yet.
- We don't--no.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.138
- Do you have a bank account?
- I have Wells Fargo.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.775
- Approximately how much
is in the checking account?

26:48.808 --> 26:50.910
- 200.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.245
[light music]

26:53.279 --> 26:55.547
- And the savings?

26:55.581 --> 26:58.885
- Uh, 4,700.
- How about cars?

26:58.918 --> 27:00.319
- I don't own a car.
I lease.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.222
- Retirement plans?
Do you have anything like that?

27:03.255 --> 27:05.457
- My plan for retirement
was to die.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.694
- Tom, same questions for you.
- This is everything.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.262
I screenshotted it for you.
- Okay.

27:12.832 --> 27:16.535
[laughter]

27:16.568 --> 27:18.705
So she is richer.
- She's--yeah.

27:18.705 --> 27:21.007
Katie has more money
than me right now,

27:21.040 --> 27:23.710
but who knows how much money
we'll have in the future?

27:23.743 --> 27:27.246
- When two guys get married,
a lot of your earnings

27:27.279 --> 27:31.283
are called community property,
then they get divided equally...

27:31.317 --> 27:32.852
- Yeah.
- Even if she makes

27:32.885 --> 27:34.987
ten times as much money.
- I wouldn't want

27:35.021 --> 27:36.923
any of her hard-earned money,
and I don't think

27:36.956 --> 27:40.226
she would want mine if we ever,
you know, did get a divorce.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.260
- Okay.
- Yeah.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.628
We would share custody
of our animals.

27:42.729 --> 27:43.896
Does that need to be
brought up?

27:43.930 --> 27:46.966
- Dogs are something unique.
How many dogs?

27:46.999 --> 27:48.367
- We have two.
- Two.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.138
- All right, so you would
share alternate weeks, months?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.941
- We would probably sort that
out on a monthly basis, like--

27:54.974 --> 27:56.575
- Let's do weekly.
- It would switch it up, yeah.

27:56.608 --> 27:57.810
- Yeah.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.545
- Having to think about
what would happen

27:59.578 --> 28:02.548
in terms of custody
of Gordo and Butter--

28:02.581 --> 28:05.084
oh, man, it gets, like,
really heavy, you know?

28:05.117 --> 28:08.554
Doing the adult thing
is just not fun.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.656
- That's about it, unless
you guys have any questions.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.825
- I was just gonna ask you,
generally speaking,

28:12.859 --> 28:15.928
do you think that couples who
get prenups are more successful?

28:15.962 --> 28:18.230
- It doesn't much matter.
I mean, God forbid,

28:18.264 --> 28:21.667
you guys split up...
at least you don't have to

28:21.768 --> 28:23.836
go through that stuff, you know?
both: Yeah.

28:27.673 --> 28:29.809
- Do you see the way that, like,
you're talking to me though?

28:29.842 --> 28:31.343
- It's--it's so--
- Well, why do you care?

28:31.377 --> 28:32.544
- It's so callous
and condescending.

28:38.785 --> 28:39.118
[upbeat music]

28:42.855 --> 28:44.123
- Okay, you guys will be
right over here.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.157
- Thank you.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.361
- Scheana.
- Hey.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.030
- Hi, babe.
- Are you going to work?

28:51.063 --> 28:52.331
- Just finished.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.901
- At Tom's birthday
the other night, I, like,

28:54.934 --> 28:56.568
went into the party
to see Raquel--

28:56.602 --> 28:58.070
- Oh.
- So I was like, "Oh, I'm happy

28:58.104 --> 29:00.106
"to see you two together,
you know,

29:00.139 --> 29:02.274
considering everything."

29:02.308 --> 29:05.878
- Considering what?
- Oh, you don't know?

29:05.912 --> 29:07.947
About Ellie?
- Oh, I've told her everything.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.449
- Ellie said she had a picture
of you in bed with her in March.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.918
- She probably jumped
in my f---ing bed

29:11.951 --> 29:13.152
and f---ing took that selfie.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.954
- I'm wondering if she
knows everything though.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.689
- I don't think she does.
- Someone at Pump told me

29:17.723 --> 29:19.091
James is playing on Friday.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.292
Somewhere.
- Where?

29:20.326 --> 29:22.128
- Hollywood.
- Should we go?

29:22.161 --> 29:24.263
- Let's go.
- I don't have sh-- to do.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.832
- I wanna make him
very uncomfortable.

29:25.832 --> 29:28.034
- Shay's in the studio
all weekend, so...

29:28.067 --> 29:29.902
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.839
Ellie has always proven herself
to be a good friend to me,

29:32.839 --> 29:36.308
so I feel like if we go
and call out James publicly

29:36.342 --> 29:38.845
and just blow his sh-- up,
then he's going to have to

29:38.845 --> 29:41.247
finally take accountability
for his actions.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.116
- Let's invite GG too.
- 'Cause you're Eskimo sisters.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.418
[laughter]

29:46.452 --> 29:49.521
[upbeat music]

29:49.555 --> 29:53.225
*

29:53.259 --> 29:54.693
- What do you think
I would like here?

29:54.726 --> 29:56.162
- I don't even know what half
this stuff means on here.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.530
- I--is any of this in English?
We are not fancy people.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.698
That's just not who we are.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.267
What do you suggest?
Do you suggest the beef

30:01.300 --> 30:03.802
or the chicken?
- I suggest the chicken.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.137
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do

30:05.171 --> 30:06.305
the salmon, please.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.573
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you sir.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.876
- I'm tired.
It's been a long weekend.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.878
I'm--I'm very happy
that your mom came.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.445
She had a great time.
I said, "Listen,

30:13.479 --> 30:15.147
"I'm sorry you saw that
at the very end.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.548
"Sometimes we get
a little tense.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.084
"I didn't mean for you
to be in the middle of one.

30:18.117 --> 30:19.685
It probably wasn't
the best timing for that."

30:19.718 --> 30:20.786
- Imagine how uncomfortable

30:20.819 --> 30:22.754
she was feeling.
- I understand.

30:22.788 --> 30:25.557
- You can't act
that ridiculous and treat

30:25.591 --> 30:27.693
someone's daughter
that way in front of them

30:27.726 --> 30:29.361
and think that everything's
just gonna be okay.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.864
So I'm not just gonna
let somebody disrespect me

30:31.898 --> 30:34.666
and just sit there.
That's not how I am,

30:34.700 --> 30:36.235
and that's not how I'm gonna be.

30:36.268 --> 30:39.205
- What's going on
with this church situation?

30:39.238 --> 30:42.308
Now, while your mom was here,
I made it like a point to say,

30:42.341 --> 30:44.743
"Listen, I'll try it,"
but you know how I really feel

30:44.776 --> 30:46.145
about organized religion.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.214
- I know.
- What kind of church is this?

30:48.247 --> 30:49.648
- It's gonna be
a Baptist church.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.250
- Is that the ones
that try to save everybody?

30:51.283 --> 30:54.620
- No, no, no, it's--
- Jesus, Jesus save you!

30:54.653 --> 30:56.188
- Maybe that's
where you need to go.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.656
- I used to go to church camp.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.458
I used to get caught like this,
and this is what

30:59.491 --> 31:01.293
they used to say, they go,

31:01.327 --> 31:03.963
"Jason, Jason, strong and able,
get your elbows off the table.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.698
"This is not a horse's table
but a first-class dining table.

31:06.732 --> 31:09.135
'Round and 'round you must go.
You were naughty."

31:09.168 --> 31:11.537
[laughter]

31:11.570 --> 31:13.105
I remember going to church
when I was a kid.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.741
They would take these huge wands
and chuck water around,

31:15.774 --> 31:17.643
and, like,
what are you throwing at me?

31:17.676 --> 31:19.045
I mean, I get it,
it's "holy water,"

31:19.078 --> 31:20.612
but, like, come on, man.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.382
I just--I don't understand
what that's symbolizing.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.051
And it's not water
they're throwing,

31:25.084 --> 31:26.953
it was some kind of oil,
because my head would be

31:26.953 --> 31:28.254
always greasy after that.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.555
- You know, I was
talking to Scheana,

31:29.588 --> 31:33.125
and she said Ellie and GG
were talking to her--

31:33.159 --> 31:37.629
You know, James'
side chicks without Raquel.

31:37.663 --> 31:41.500
He's DJing at this bar
tomorrow night called The Study.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.035
- Well, I would love
to go to that.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.237
He's gonna be in a world of hurt
with all these girls.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.473
And then you got me there too?
I would be stressed out.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.441
- But listen--I'm saying, like,
no fighting or anything

31:49.475 --> 31:51.343
because the probation
still stands.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.812
- If something does happen,
I'm sorry ahead of time.

31:53.845 --> 31:56.348
- That's not okay.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.117
[upbeat music]

31:58.150 --> 32:03.355
- * So drink up that champagne
like it's okay *

32:03.389 --> 32:06.525
* 'Cause somebody's paying

32:06.558 --> 32:08.894
* So just keep on sipping

32:08.995 --> 32:11.797
- Oh, is this
what we're painting today?

32:11.830 --> 32:14.033
- Oh!
- Who are these guys?

32:14.066 --> 32:16.435
- Look what I brought for you.
- Where should we go?

32:16.468 --> 32:18.004
Over here?
- You guys are over here.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.605
- Have you guys
done this before?

32:19.638 --> 32:21.640
- No.
- There she is.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.842
- Ah!
- Stassi.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.177
[overlapping greetings]

32:25.211 --> 32:27.146
- Hi.
- All right, friends,

32:27.179 --> 32:28.580
we're gonna go ahead and start.

32:28.614 --> 32:29.748
- All right.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.850
- We're gonna use
our big brush here.

32:31.883 --> 32:36.022
And we're gonna go ahead and mix
some of the brown and white.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.757
- I'm just blending some things
that I didn't like.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.028
Painting is not
my strongest talent or skill.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.895
I'm much better at coloring.

32:43.929 --> 32:46.165
- Mine started really good.
Now it's falling apart.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.599
- You're not Monet.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.202
- We're gonna start in
on these grass pussy willows--

32:50.236 --> 32:51.770
I don't know what they are.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.273
- But in the words of Bob Ross,
"There are no mistakes,

32:54.306 --> 32:55.874
only happy accidents."

32:55.907 --> 32:59.111
- We're just gonna go
and make a big circle

32:59.145 --> 33:02.548
off-center to the right.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.183
- So New Orleans, huh, guys?

33:04.216 --> 33:06.252
- We have a--like a local
to show us the cool spots.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.686
- Have you all
been to New Orleans?

33:07.719 --> 33:08.687
- No, never.
- Uh-uh.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.688
- You grew up there, right?

33:09.721 --> 33:11.657
- She grew up there.
- Yeah.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.893
- I don't wanna make this a
bigger deal that it already is.

33:14.926 --> 33:17.196
I wanna make sure
that you guys are cool.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.964
- Is there anybody
who feels not cool?

33:19.065 --> 33:21.533
- No, I thought you guys had
like a blow-up, and I just--

33:21.567 --> 33:25.071
- We had a conversation.
- It felt, like, abrasive...

33:25.071 --> 33:28.274
to just look at me and be like,
"I don't give a f--- about you."

33:28.307 --> 33:31.677
- I mean--
- I just--I don't feel like I--

33:34.113 --> 33:36.215
Do you see the way that, like,
you're talking to me though?

33:36.248 --> 33:37.916
It's--it's so--
- Well, why do you care?

33:37.949 --> 33:39.451
- It's so callous
and condescending.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.153
Because we're all friends
with the same people.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.322
- It's fine.
- I--

33:43.355 --> 33:44.456
- It is, though.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.791
- It's not for me.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.193
It's not for me.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.594
So it makes me
feel uncomfortable,

33:48.627 --> 33:50.396
and it makes me feel sad.
You hurt my feelings.

33:50.429 --> 33:51.997
- She can't make you
feel any way.

33:52.098 --> 33:55.000
You choose to feel
a certain way.

33:55.101 --> 33:57.103
It's a fact, so...

33:58.970 --> 34:00.272
- Like, you don't care about

34:00.306 --> 34:01.740
what's important
to your friends.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.842
You don't--you don't--
- What do you want me to do?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.311
- Everybody is stupid,
everyone is dumb--

34:05.344 --> 34:07.779
- Be fake friends with someone?
- No one's opinions matter.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.849
- No one?
Or people I'm not friends with?

34:10.882 --> 34:13.685
[dramatic music]

34:13.719 --> 34:15.687
I mean, if I want to be friends
with her, then yeah,

34:15.721 --> 34:17.723
I would give a f---
about her opinion.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.191
- I have an opinion about this,

34:19.225 --> 34:21.960
and I don't want this
to continue.

34:21.993 --> 34:26.765
- In Stassi's bubble of a world,
it's just what she wants 24-7.

34:26.798 --> 34:29.335
- No such thing as mistakes.
You can fix everything.

34:29.368 --> 34:32.571
- She's been granted that
for so many years of her life

34:32.604 --> 34:35.141
that I don't even think
she realizes

34:35.141 --> 34:36.275
that that's not normal.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.876
- This is not coming
to New Orleans with us.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.145
The boys are gonna
be separating,

34:39.178 --> 34:40.546
the girls are gonna
be separating,

34:40.579 --> 34:42.148
so if you all
can't get along, I don't know.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.383
- Well, she's gonna come with
the dudes anyways, I think.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.917
- Oh, okay, that's cool.
- No, no, not--

34:45.951 --> 34:47.453
- That's awesome.
- Not in a catty sort of way,

34:47.486 --> 34:49.020
just 'cause that
she's a groomsman.

34:49.054 --> 34:51.523
- Of course.
- No, Bubba, it's not like that.

34:51.557 --> 34:53.592
It's not in a catty--
- Just one of the guys.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.495
- Katie can't get upset that
she's gonna be hanging out

34:56.528 --> 35:00.065
with the other groomsmen
on the bachelor party.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.867
Like, you excluded her
in the first place.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.435
- Then we don't
need to get along.

35:03.469 --> 35:04.603
- Bubba, no--
- You don't like her.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.938
She accepts that,
and we all move forward.

35:06.972 --> 35:08.574
- You guys,
that's not productive.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.309
- So awesome.
- They do get along.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.578
Bubba, let's not make a--
- This is people getting along?

35:12.611 --> 35:15.714
[dramatic music]

35:15.747 --> 35:17.783
- Get your dumpy ass
out of my face.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.619
- Whoa.
- Are you kidding me right now?

35:25.557 --> 35:26.492
- * I just wanted
to wake up next to you *

35:28.927 --> 35:32.198
* I can't believe you are
a one-night stand... *

35:32.231 --> 35:34.233
- What's up, guys?
- All right, come on in.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.467
- Cheers, guys.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.569
Tonight is the night
I've been waiting for.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.037
I've been writing
lots of new music.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.739
I have three songs
that I play in a row.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.107
Do you want to, like,
be the DJ for those songs?

35:42.208 --> 35:43.475
- Yeah, I got you.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.311
- I've got all my friends
and family coming,

35:45.344 --> 35:47.813
and I'm gonna f---ing kill it.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.080
- Hello.
- Hi.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.983
- IDs please.
- All right.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.019
- James has done a lot
of sh---y things

35:54.052 --> 35:57.456
to a lot of people, and now,
with this whole GG

35:57.489 --> 35:59.558
and Ellie thing,
he needs to get a taste

35:59.591 --> 36:01.360
of his own medicine,
and if they're gonna go

36:01.393 --> 36:04.963
to his show to call him out,
I wanna go to the show to watch.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.933
*

36:07.966 --> 36:12.438
- What the f---
is Jax doing here?

36:12.471 --> 36:14.806
I--I didn't think
you were gonna come.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.249
- I bet.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.916
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Study,

36:24.950 --> 36:26.485
how we feeling tonight,
all right?

36:26.518 --> 36:28.287
[cheers and applause]

36:28.320 --> 36:29.988
Let's go, let's go.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.257
Okay, okay,

36:31.290 --> 36:33.292
let's go, let's go.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.560
Okay, okay.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.762
Lala, are you in the building?

36:36.795 --> 36:41.032
[dance music plays]

36:41.066 --> 36:42.801
- * Taking me to a higher place
on the daily *

36:42.834 --> 36:44.370
* Don't get ahead 'cause
you'll think I'm crazy *

36:44.403 --> 36:45.804
* But she got me feeling dizzy

36:45.837 --> 36:47.273
- Oh, wait, no, he's
performing, legit performing.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.407
- * Wake up in the morning
I'm feeling hazy *

36:48.440 --> 36:49.841
* When I say it

36:49.875 --> 36:51.310
* Just know I need it

36:51.343 --> 36:52.911
* Girl, take your time

36:52.944 --> 36:54.546
[continues rapping
in background]

36:59.651 --> 37:01.287
- * You just wanna
drive it harder *

37:01.287 --> 37:04.290
* I just wanna go in like
a superstar *

37:04.290 --> 37:06.625
Yeah, how you doing,
Los Angeles?

37:06.658 --> 37:07.726
You all right?

37:07.759 --> 37:08.794
[cheers and applause]

37:08.827 --> 37:10.862
This one's
called "Get Loose."

37:10.896 --> 37:13.098
- Where's my popcorn?

37:13.131 --> 37:14.966
- * Hold up, get loose

37:15.000 --> 37:18.304
[continues rapping
indistinctly]

37:18.304 --> 37:20.872
* I don't even know, 'cause
I just don't trust her *

37:20.906 --> 37:22.341
* Going back once more

37:22.374 --> 37:24.343
* Hold up on the dance floor

37:24.376 --> 37:28.447
[continues rapping
indistinctly]

37:28.480 --> 37:32.318
- Seeing Kristen walk into
The Study is like a bad omen.

37:32.351 --> 37:35.421
It reminds me of "The Matrix"
when that black cat

37:35.454 --> 37:38.624
walked by twice,
meaning something bad

37:38.657 --> 37:40.392
is about to happen.

37:40.426 --> 37:44.330
*

37:44.330 --> 37:45.531
- How are you?

37:56.141 --> 37:57.175
- Ooh.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.478
- Normally,
you couldn't pay me

37:59.511 --> 38:02.681
to listen to one
of DJ James Kennedy's sets,

38:02.714 --> 38:05.617
but tonight, I wanna watch
that mother----er burn.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.719
- Yo, yo, yo, thank you guys
for having me tonight.

38:07.753 --> 38:08.754
My name's James Kennedy.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.055
both: Hi.

38:49.561 --> 38:52.731
[edgy music]

38:52.764 --> 38:54.132
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.870
- Oh, right.
What's up, how are you?

38:58.904 --> 39:00.171
- This is Raquel.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.408
What the f---
are they doing here?

39:02.408 --> 39:04.142
Oh, I know, just being groupies.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.310
It's what they do best.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.182
- Why do you have my clothes?

39:11.216 --> 39:14.820
[edgy music]

39:14.853 --> 39:16.888
- Are you that psycho?
Really?

39:27.298 --> 39:29.568
- Jax, Jax!
- Jax!

39:29.601 --> 39:31.870
- Are you kidding me right now?
Are you serious?

39:49.220 --> 39:51.490
I think Ellie and GG
are just pissed

39:51.523 --> 39:53.258
that they actually
slept with James.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.461
They don't give a f---
about Raquel.

39:55.494 --> 39:56.528
That's bullsh--.

40:00.799 --> 40:03.502
- Thank you for coming.
- Ooh, we wouldn't miss it.

- Thank you for coming.

[glass shattering]

40:21.887 --> 40:22.387
- Thank you for coming.

Walk away.

[tense music]

40:30.195 --> 40:31.863

- Jax, no!

40:38.570 --> 40:40.205
[indistinct shouting]

40:43.308 --> 40:45.143
- You're all f---ing losers!

40:48.213 --> 40:49.648
- The f--- is going on, man?
You okay?

40:49.681 --> 40:50.849
- Jax f---ing threw
a drink in my face

40:50.882 --> 40:52.350
at my f---ing performance.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.385
You're all f---ing lowlifes.
All your friends are lowlifes.

40:54.419 --> 40:55.654
- Relax, take a breath.
Take a breath.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.355
- Hey, no, it dictates
what you're f---ing like

40:57.388 --> 40:58.990
because you're f---ing
been friends with them

40:59.024 --> 41:03.161
since the get-go, f---ing--
your friends are losers.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.430
Tom should know better
than bringing old man Jax

41:05.531 --> 41:06.832
to my f---ing show
because he knows

41:06.865 --> 41:08.299
how it's probably gonna end up.

41:08.333 --> 41:11.069
He knows Jax is a jealous
prick--he always has been.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.538
F--- off, Tom.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.640
I need my suit jacket.
It's Gucci.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.542
- James, let's go.
- I need my suit jacket.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.443
- Raquel's right here.
We're going now.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.946
- Hey, what the f---
was that, man?

41:20.979 --> 41:23.414
- Why are you defending James?
- He just came up to me

41:23.448 --> 41:24.983
and tried to kick me
in the f---ing shin.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.217
- I don't f---ing
believe that.

41:26.251 --> 41:27.653
You threw the drink first.
- Oh, my--

41:27.686 --> 41:29.087
- Jax and Kristen show up,
they're like,

41:29.120 --> 41:31.456
"Oh, I have no idea, oh."

41:31.557 --> 41:33.124
What are you guys doing here?

41:33.158 --> 41:35.226
It's not enough that
a lot of these people

41:35.260 --> 41:37.629
got him fired
from Pump and Sur.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.765
They gotta go to a place
out of their way

41:39.798 --> 41:41.900
to try and get him fired
from his new job.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.903
- You have James' back over his?
- I don't give a sh--

41:44.936 --> 41:47.138
if James f---ed those girls.
- I didn't do sh--.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.439
What did I do?
- You threw a f---ing drink

41:48.473 --> 41:49.741
in his face.
- 'Cause he came up to me

41:49.775 --> 41:51.042
and started
antagonizing me, yes.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.711
- Because he knows
why you're here.

41:52.744 --> 41:55.681
- Are you and James
like BFFs?

41:55.714 --> 41:58.083
- I don't have to be BFFs
to see a situation

41:58.116 --> 42:00.085
and know that this is f---ed up.
- This has nothing to do

42:00.118 --> 42:01.653
with you.
James got in our face.

42:01.687 --> 42:04.222
- Look, this whole situation
is not a good look,

42:04.255 --> 42:07.158
and I can't f---ing back you
on this sh--.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.329
- Next time,
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:11.362 --> 42:14.600
Let's present
Mrs. Jacqueline Taylor.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.701
[laughter]

42:15.734 --> 42:17.335
- Yeah, I never heard
of this "Gavinchy" guy.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.336
- [correcting]
Givenchy.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.638
- I only wear Givenchy.

42:19.671 --> 42:22.007
- Like, I don't know
if you're, like, able

42:22.040 --> 42:26.778
to stay loyal to me,
like, while I'm away.

42:26.812 --> 42:28.113
- You gotta trust me.

42:28.146 --> 42:29.681

- A lot of people feel that
you're fake a lot of the time.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.485
- I have said I'm sorry.
It was tacky, it was classless,

42:34.519 --> 42:36.154
I'm sorry!
- Calm down.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.689
- No! F--- this!

42:37.723 --> 42:39.257
God!
- Oh.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.061
- She's the one
that doesn't like me.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.963
- It's funny because it's true.

42:44.996 --> 42:47.098
- This was my f---ing day--
- Okay.

42:47.132 --> 42:49.467
- And she cast a shadow
on this day.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.536
I did not ask Ariana
to be a bridesmaid

42:51.637 --> 42:52.804
