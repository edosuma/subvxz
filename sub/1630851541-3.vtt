00:17.618 --> 00:19.885
- Today.
- [chuckles] No, I can't.

Today is the Chili Cook-off at

in those teeth.

00:24.491 --> 00:25.891
They have to come out.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.027

these teeth all my life.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.228
They fill out my mouth.

00:29.364 --> 00:30.629
They give me
a nice long chew-span.

three years ago.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.166

00:34.301 --> 00:35.901

a Pancake Cook-off.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.370
- That's because I'm
a great Cook-off judge.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.504

00:39.506 --> 00:40.906
- Fine. Let's do it.
