WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:03.700
- You're home.
- Mr Nathan! Mr Nathan's back.

00:03.756 --> 00:05.812
This day was always going to come.
Now the world will

00:05.822 --> 00:07.774
change, you'll see. We can
make it work, can't we?

00:07.774 --> 00:09.787
Well,
if we could convince the railway

00:09.787 --> 00:11.816
to bring a branch line
across our land...

00:11.816 --> 00:13.816
Then that is what we shall do.

00:13.816 --> 00:17.786
Just don't expect everyone to welcome
these changes with open arms.

00:17.786 --> 00:18.819
Do you believe in ghosts?

00:18.819 --> 00:20.731
HE SCOFFS

00:20.731 --> 00:21.816
We've been down here five minutes

00:21.816 --> 00:24.749
and you've gone back
to being a psychologist.

00:28.791 --> 00:31.752
'Daddy!' Gabriel.

00:31.752 --> 00:32.793
'Daddy, where are you, Daddy?'

00:32.793 --> 00:36.766
GWEN: I used to hear a little boy's
laughter in the house.

00:36.766 --> 00:38.731
Then one day, no more laughter.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:20.833 --> 01:24.779
Do you remember you drew something
on the wall in my house?

01:24.779 --> 01:26.828
Like a figure
with a book in her hand.

01:26.828 --> 01:28.837
Um... Something like this.

01:32.807 --> 01:34.800
I don't think so.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.841
Could you have seen an image
like this before? In my house?

01:37.841 --> 01:39.778
On my desk?

01:39.778 --> 01:42.823
I'm sorry, Mr Appleby,
it doesn't mean anything to me.

01:44.796 --> 01:46.793
It's all right. Let me show you out.

01:46.793 --> 01:48.806
Thank you, Harriet.

01:53.812 --> 01:57.782
DISTANT EXPLOSION

02:09.859 --> 02:13.849
Sorry, Mrs Appleby,
I didn't know you were here.

02:13.849 --> 02:14.869
Thank you, Gwen.

02:28.871 --> 02:31.812
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

02:46.863 --> 02:50.885
BOY SHOUTS PLAYFULLY

02:59.889 --> 03:01.861
Charlie!

03:01.861 --> 03:02.882
Mr Appleby.

03:04.823 --> 03:08.848
Shouldn't you be working in the
fields? Yes, sir, just on my way now.

03:08.848 --> 03:10.809
DISTANT EXPLOSION

03:12.894 --> 03:18.825
Or...would you rather come and watch
the surveyors blow things up?

03:21.830 --> 03:24.811
Now, I'm no expert, Gideon...
That's right, ma'am.

03:26.824 --> 03:28.841
These look to me like stones.

03:28.841 --> 03:31.866
Yes, ma'am. Because the field
hasn't been cleared yet.

03:31.866 --> 03:33.883
Well, why hasn't it been cleared?

03:33.883 --> 03:36.853
That was John's job, to tell us
what to do and when to do it.

03:37.853 --> 03:40.822
EXPLOSION

03:42.891 --> 03:45.865
It's just the surveyors
at Brockley Combe. Pay it no mind.

03:45.865 --> 03:47.909
Why do they have to blow great holes
in the valley, ma'am?

03:47.909 --> 03:49.830
They're surveying the land

03:49.830 --> 03:52.816
to see whether it's capable
of taking a viaduct over the valley.

03:52.816 --> 03:53.880
A viaduct?!

03:53.880 --> 03:56.857
They're here because Mr Appleby
petitioned for them to be here,

03:56.857 --> 03:58.890
so we will make them welcome.

04:01.823 --> 04:03.876
If we could get a railway port
near here,

04:03.876 --> 04:05.861
we could churn our butter
in the afternoon,

04:05.861 --> 04:08.879
and it would be on the breakfast tables of
Bristol and London by the next morning.

04:08.879 --> 04:10.875
Imagine that!
THEY GIGGLE

04:10.875 --> 04:13.837
EXPLOSION

04:16.922 --> 04:18.891
'It's looking quite promising.'

04:18.891 --> 04:22.905
Definitely Keuper marls. We just
need it to be of significant depth.

04:22.905 --> 04:26.850
Appleby. Look at these!

04:26.850 --> 04:28.887
Neolithic flints.

04:29.888 --> 04:31.893
Hmm?

04:31.893 --> 04:37.847
The last human to touch these
has been dead for 7,000 years.

04:37.847 --> 04:38.932
THEY CHUCKLE

04:38.932 --> 04:40.884
Mr Appleby?

04:47.924 --> 04:51.889
Charlie, you can do the honours.
Go on.

04:52.914 --> 04:54.903
Push it down, lad, nice and firm.

05:01.906 --> 05:02.938
HE GASPS

05:02.938 --> 05:04.867
MEN LAUGH

# This one night

# Every night and all

05:46.909 --> 05:51.911
# Fire and sleet and candlelight

05:51.911 --> 05:56.925
# And Christ receive thy soul. #

06:09.006 --> 06:10.924
LAUGHTER

06:13.202 --> 06:15.175
I remember when old Mrs Appleby

06:15.174 --> 06:17.179
grubbed out
the Tremlett Bitter orchards

06:17.178 --> 06:18.238
and replaced 'em with Dabinett.

06:18.238 --> 06:20.239
You were in here every night,

06:20.238 --> 06:23.235
moaning your head off
about the evils of progress.

06:23.234 --> 06:26.148
There's nothing wrong
with Tremletts.

06:26.146 --> 06:28.155
Who wants a train, anyways?

06:28.155 --> 06:31.168
Nasty, noisy buggers, they is.
I expect...

06:31.166 --> 06:33.155
Shhh, the engineers will hear you.

06:33.154 --> 06:34.238
You know what, the engineers...

06:37.186 --> 06:41.168
No good will come of this,
you mark my words.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.227
It's like talking to a wall.

06:43.234 --> 06:48.208
I was just saying, like my dear old
granfer used to say to me...

06:50.166 --> 06:54.160
..what lies beneath
should be left beneath.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.243
SHE HUMS QUIETLY TO HERSELF

07:33.215 --> 07:35.160
I failed to conceive again.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.183
We will get there, I promise you.

07:42.199 --> 07:46.156
I thought coming down here,
away from London,

07:46.154 --> 07:47.211
all the peace and quiet...

07:47.211 --> 07:50.204
We know there's no medical reason.
We just have to be patient.

07:52.147 --> 07:53.167
I know.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.156
It's just...

07:57.214 --> 08:00.160
I want your baby, Nathan Appleby.

08:14.171 --> 08:15.211
I want your baby.

08:35.167 --> 08:36.195
Bed, girls.

08:36.195 --> 08:38.212
Do we have to?

08:38.211 --> 08:42.201
Goodnight, Charlie. We all
will be safe under your protection.

08:57.163 --> 08:59.152
Charlie, bed!

09:00.239 --> 09:02.179
All safe, Mother.

09:21.195 --> 09:25.152
DOG WHINES

09:27.171 --> 09:29.192
Shhh, boy, it's just the wind.

09:32.180 --> 09:35.193
DOG WHINES

09:35.191 --> 09:36.243
What is it?

09:36.243 --> 09:38.168
CHILDREN LAUGH

09:38.167 --> 09:40.192
It's just children playing.

09:41.227 --> 09:43.176
At this time of night?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.221
GHOSTLY VOICES: David...

10:49.152 --> 10:52.149
VOICES CONTINUE WHISPERING

10:55.204 --> 10:58.177
Charlie? What are you doing?

11:18.216 --> 11:21.177
Considering your
experience as a farm manager,

11:21.176 --> 11:24.217
where do you stand on the new-model
traction engines, Mr Woolford?

11:25.240 --> 11:28.193
I'd never buy one, I know that.
Why would that be?

11:28.192 --> 11:33.166
I'd let some other fool take all the
risk and rent one when I needed it.

11:35.156 --> 11:38.157
But the "other fool"
may become a very rich man

11:38.156 --> 11:40.225
and you will be forever
under obligation to him.

11:40.224 --> 11:44.194
I saw your shiny new traction
on the way in, ma'am.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.217
Broken, is it?

11:49.204 --> 11:52.245
You do seem to move around a lot.
Why would that be?

11:52.244 --> 11:54.197
I've come a long way, ma'am.

11:54.196 --> 11:58.150
I think it only fair
I get to speak to the master.

11:58.148 --> 11:59.196
Except he's not here, is he?

11:59.196 --> 12:04.159
But I am here, Mr Woolford,
and I appear to be a sentient being.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.217
How's that weather looking, Gideon?

12:08.216 --> 12:10.197
Set fair, sir, set fair.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.181
It doesn't bother me

12:12.180 --> 12:14.197
that they'd rather speak
to an insect than a woman,

12:14.196 --> 12:16.241
but what does bother me
is that their views on agriculture

12:16.240 --> 12:19.189
haven't changed
since the Romans moved on.

12:25.169 --> 12:27.166
THEY LAUGH

12:28.228 --> 12:30.193
We'll find someone.

13:02.213 --> 13:06.151
Charlie? What's the matter?

13:06.149 --> 13:07.209
Nothing.

13:07.208 --> 13:10.181
Don't you dare speak to Mr Appleby
like that! He asked you a question.

13:10.180 --> 13:14.158
It's all right, Agnes.
Was there somebody there?

13:15.180 --> 13:17.153
No, sir.

13:17.152 --> 13:19.225
'Twas the Red Boys.
Shut up! You shut up!

13:20.237 --> 13:22.194
Charlie?

13:31.168 --> 13:33.157
Tell me about these boys.

13:34.157 --> 13:35.229
Are they like imaginary friends?

13:35.228 --> 13:38.149
Only children
have friends like that.

13:42.236 --> 13:44.177
They came for me.

13:45.217 --> 13:46.241
In the night.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.241
What did they want?

13:49.240 --> 13:51.245
For me to go with them.

13:51.245 --> 13:53.178
Go where?

13:55.217 --> 13:56.233
Don't know.

13:59.153 --> 14:02.230
Do you know what a nightmare is,
Charlie? A dream that goes bad?

14:02.229 --> 14:04.226
Mm-hm.

14:06.237 --> 14:08.206
They were real, sir.

14:09.237 --> 14:11.246
No matter how real they seem,
Charlie,

14:11.245 --> 14:13.242
they are just pictures
in your head.

14:16.217 --> 14:19.170
Pictures cannot harm you.

14:22.173 --> 14:26.158
What do I do if they come again?
Let them come.

14:27.213 --> 14:30.242
We are men and they are pictures.
Let them come.

14:33.245 --> 14:36.151
GENTLE HUMMING

14:41.217 --> 14:43.154
Gwen, it's you.

14:44.209 --> 14:45.242
What are you doing?

14:45.241 --> 14:49.166
Just a little something, ma'am.
A little something of what?

14:49.165 --> 14:52.191
For you and Mr Appleby,
to help you get with child.

14:55.245 --> 14:57.198
I have been pushed and prodded

14:57.197 --> 14:59.246
by some of the most expensive
doctors in London.

14:59.245 --> 15:02.242
I don't think some boiled grass
is going to make much difference.

15:02.241 --> 15:04.166
This works, ma'am.

15:07.149 --> 15:08.186
What's in it?

15:08.186 --> 15:12.163
Some cabbage leaves,
mandrake, marjoram,

15:12.161 --> 15:13.202
er...thyme, parsley,

15:13.201 --> 15:17.155
the root of worm fern
and the, er... Oh...

15:17.154 --> 15:18.170
What?

15:18.169 --> 15:19.225
It's the tail of a slowworm.

15:19.225 --> 15:21.218
What's that for? Added potency.

15:21.217 --> 15:24.223
And the raspberries,
what are they for?

15:24.222 --> 15:27.203
To take away the taste
of the slowworm.

15:29.210 --> 15:32.235
THEY LAUGH

15:32.233 --> 15:36.179
I believe an early night
is called for, Mr Appleby.

15:36.178 --> 15:37.210
What's that? Wine?

15:37.209 --> 15:40.243
It's...like wine, yes.

15:40.242 --> 15:42.162
Come on.

15:46.221 --> 15:48.154
Nathan!

15:57.210 --> 16:01.248
David... Harrington...

16:01.246 --> 16:04.175
Abraham... Henry...

16:04.174 --> 16:07.199
Benjamin... Ebenezer...

16:07.197 --> 16:09.174
Pictures in me head.

16:16.161 --> 16:18.190
David... Harrington...

16:18.190 --> 16:20.175
Abraham... Henry...

16:20.174 --> 16:21.218
Benjamin... Ebenezer...

16:23.225 --> 16:25.246
Charlie... Charlie...

16:29.222 --> 16:31.235
Come and play, Charlie.

16:31.234 --> 16:34.179
Come with us.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.211
We could do it.

16:41.230 --> 16:43.195
We could actually do it.

16:47.178 --> 16:50.219
"Why are you so excited,
beloved wife?" Sorry.

16:51.217 --> 16:52.234
Strawberries.

16:54.226 --> 16:56.219
Arable crops are susceptible

16:56.218 --> 16:59.179
to the vicissitudes
of the weather, yes?

16:59.178 --> 17:03.172
And turning this place into a dairy
farm would decimate the community.

17:03.170 --> 17:06.223
That will never happen, Charlotte...
But...strawberries.

17:08.170 --> 17:09.242
If we got our branch line,

17:09.242 --> 17:13.220
we could access markets
we've never even dreamed of,

17:13.218 --> 17:17.184
build huge glasshouses, be
in control of the growing process.

17:17.182 --> 17:19.166
If it comes.

17:19.165 --> 17:21.202
It will come.

17:21.202 --> 17:23.163
I know it will.

17:23.162 --> 17:24.219
DOG WHINES

17:29.234 --> 17:31.195
Where are you going?

17:32.230 --> 17:34.171
To take the dog out.

17:35.195 --> 17:37.159
Go to sleep.

17:39.202 --> 17:41.175
Come on, Toby.

17:51.150 --> 17:52.195
SHE SHUDDERS

17:57.174 --> 17:58.243
Toby...

18:04.166 --> 18:07.179
APPROACHING ENGINE ROARS

18:07.178 --> 18:10.152
BRAKES SQUEAL

18:12.215 --> 18:14.171
ENGINE ROARS

18:14.170 --> 18:15.219
SUDDEN SILENCE

18:19.211 --> 18:21.240
Mr Appleby, thank God!
Is Charlie with you?

18:23.190 --> 18:25.247
No. No, of course not.
He's gone missing, sir!

18:31.151 --> 18:32.159
Charlie?

18:36.166 --> 18:38.211
CHILDREN LAUGH

18:38.211 --> 18:40.168
Charlie! Is that you?

18:40.167 --> 18:42.164
CHILDREN LAUGH AND CHATTER

18:47.187 --> 18:48.227
Charlie?

18:54.187 --> 18:56.240
CHILDREN LAUGHING AND PLAYING

19:01.151 --> 19:02.183
Charlie!

19:02.182 --> 19:05.176
CHARLIE LAUGHS

19:08.171 --> 19:11.192
HAPPILY: No! No, you didn't get me!
Charlie!

19:29.227 --> 19:32.176
GHOSTLY VOICE: Stay with us, Charlie.

19:50.151 --> 19:51.168
Agnes!

19:51.167 --> 19:53.160
Charlie!

19:58.231 --> 19:59.247
Thank you.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.180
What the hell
you been playing at, boy?

20:06.187 --> 20:09.168
Take this, Charlie.
It'll help you sleep. Charlie!

20:10.203 --> 20:11.239
Out. Come on.

20:11.239 --> 20:13.176
That's it. Good.

20:17.199 --> 20:19.152
That's it.

20:21.215 --> 20:23.236
Now, what was happening in the woods?

20:23.236 --> 20:25.232
None of your business.

20:25.231 --> 20:28.177
I thought we were friends.

20:28.175 --> 20:30.200
I'm not to talk to you no more.

20:34.215 --> 20:37.165
Now, why's that?
Cos you're a bastard.

20:37.164 --> 20:40.197
That is enough!
You're all bastards and liars!

20:56.203 --> 20:59.224
You must forgive him, Mr Appleby.
He's not a bad boy.

21:00.240 --> 21:05.154
Has he spoken to you about anything
recently? Anything unusual?

21:06.227 --> 21:08.152
Agnes.

21:10.151 --> 21:13.208
He's been worried, sir,
I won't lie to you. What about?

21:15.155 --> 21:20.233
The changes. Your mother dying,
and traction engines, and John...

21:22.215 --> 21:24.244
He's worried what will come of us.
We all are.

21:38.235 --> 21:42.217
What are you doing? Just looking
for something for Charlie.

21:42.216 --> 21:46.166
I have had the most brilliant idea.
I know, you've told me. Strawberries.

21:46.164 --> 21:48.205
No, even more brilliant than that.

21:48.204 --> 21:50.248
I know they're here somewhere.

21:50.247 --> 21:53.153
I am talking
about the future of Shepzoy

21:53.152 --> 21:55.241
and you're rummaging
through a cupboard.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.212
Yes.

21:57.211 --> 22:00.233
Yes, what?
Yes, I think it's a brilliant idea.

22:00.232 --> 22:02.165
What is?

22:02.164 --> 22:03.244
You being our new farm manager.

22:05.152 --> 22:07.173
Do you really think I could do it?

22:07.172 --> 22:08.224
I think you'd be the best thing

22:08.224 --> 22:10.225
that's ever happened
to this old place.

22:14.220 --> 22:16.205
Harrington...

22:18.156 --> 22:19.220
Abraham...

22:26.212 --> 22:28.229
David...

22:28.228 --> 22:30.169
Henry...

22:31.208 --> 22:33.185
Benjamin...

22:33.184 --> 22:35.225
FLOORBOARDS CREAK

22:38.196 --> 22:40.237
How are you feeling?

22:40.236 --> 22:42.225
Not so good, your mother says.

22:45.172 --> 22:47.241
Am I still a bastard and a liar?

22:47.240 --> 22:50.157
You said
they were pictures in my head.

22:51.240 --> 22:55.162
Yes, I did. That was a lie.

22:57.193 --> 22:58.237
I've brought you something.

23:01.180 --> 23:04.178
I was clearing out the cupboard
and I found these.

23:09.164 --> 23:12.249
We must have fought the Battle of
Balaclava at least a hundred times.

23:12.248 --> 23:14.241
Gabriel and I.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.225
And these little soldiers
never once let us down.

23:20.229 --> 23:23.234
Last night in the woods,
were you playing with the boys?

23:28.192 --> 23:29.248
How many boys were there?

23:37.204 --> 23:42.230
So here's you,
standing in the clearing.

23:42.228 --> 23:45.225
Where are the other boys?

23:55.245 --> 23:57.246
Did they surround you, like this?

24:10.176 --> 24:12.173
David.

24:12.172 --> 24:13.221
Abraham.

24:14.248 --> 24:16.173
Harrington.

24:20.185 --> 24:22.153
Benjamin.

24:25.205 --> 24:28.190
Your mother says
you're afraid of leaving this farm.

24:29.229 --> 24:31.181
I give you my word, Charlie.

24:31.180 --> 24:33.213
For as long as I'm here,
that will never happen.

24:36.157 --> 24:40.194
I don't belong here.
Who said you don't belong here?

25:10.157 --> 25:12.222
I wanted to gather you together
this morning

25:12.221 --> 25:14.178
with some exciting news.

25:14.177 --> 25:17.174
Well, I'm excited,
and I very much hope you will be.

25:17.173 --> 25:19.194
Oh, they will be, ma'am,
don't you worry about that.

25:21.157 --> 25:22.230
From this moment on...

25:24.161 --> 25:25.246
..I am going to be
the farm manager.

25:30.165 --> 25:33.166
Well, that is marvellous news,
ma'am.

25:35.221 --> 25:38.207
Now, I am not that experienced,

25:38.206 --> 25:41.171
as many of you know
and have kindly pointed out.

25:41.169 --> 25:44.170
But I am willing to learn.

25:44.169 --> 25:48.203
And I will learn,
I give you my word on that.

25:48.201 --> 25:51.174
I will be the first one at work
in the morning

25:51.173 --> 25:52.246
and the last one here at night.

25:55.221 --> 25:58.194
Well, that's all I wanted to say,
I think.

25:58.193 --> 26:01.223
There's a lot of preparation to do
before the harvest.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.162
That went well, ma'am.

26:10.161 --> 26:13.231
ANIMATED CHATTER

26:13.229 --> 26:17.166
What did I say, friends?
We're all off to hell in a handcart.

26:24.226 --> 26:27.207
Is there any reason why Charlie
would feel like an outsider here?

26:28.209 --> 26:29.238
Outsider?

26:31.186 --> 26:33.198
Yes, in the village
or in your family.

26:33.197 --> 26:36.251
No, sir.
Why would you even say such a thing?

26:37.249 --> 26:40.198
Agnes. Agnes...

26:41.249 --> 26:46.171
If you want me to help Charlie,
we can have no secrets.

26:56.237 --> 26:58.158
Charlie?

27:00.201 --> 27:02.194
I had a sister, sir.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.195
Ruth. Yes, I remember Ruth.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.171
Life was not kind to her
and she became...

27:11.170 --> 27:15.228
She fell into low company and died,
worn out with disease.

27:30.177 --> 27:35.191
A lock of her hair, sir,
given to me the day before she died.

27:35.189 --> 27:38.199
You see the different hair
threaded through?

27:42.185 --> 27:44.174
A baby's hair.

27:45.214 --> 27:46.250
Charlie's?

27:46.250 --> 27:49.228
He were not a year old
when his mother died.

27:49.226 --> 27:51.250
I took him as my own.

27:53.198 --> 27:57.172
Does he know? I'm to give him
this letter when I do see fit.

27:57.170 --> 27:58.194
It tells him everything.

28:05.173 --> 28:07.158
I have loved him as my own.

28:08.222 --> 28:12.183
Fiercer than my own, if anything,
cos I did know where he came from.

28:17.242 --> 28:20.195
What good would it do him
to know that he was not mine,

28:20.194 --> 28:23.159
me, who loves him
more than life itself?

28:23.158 --> 28:24.239
You have done a fine job, Agnes.

28:26.158 --> 28:27.226
You'll know when the time is right.

28:28.234 --> 28:30.195
SCREAMING

28:49.171 --> 28:51.247
CHATTER

28:55.170 --> 28:56.235
What's he up to?

28:56.235 --> 28:58.171
OLD MAN: Abraham...

29:03.191 --> 29:04.219
David...

29:07.154 --> 29:08.179
Henry...

29:09.230 --> 29:11.163
Benjamin...

29:22.190 --> 29:23.242
CLUNK

29:25.242 --> 29:28.224
HOLLOW POUNDING

29:28.223 --> 29:30.191
Over here, lads!

29:31.211 --> 29:33.208
There's some kind of entrance.

29:38.171 --> 29:40.236
Align the gun with your face.

29:40.235 --> 29:43.180
Up.

29:43.178 --> 29:45.195
Back it into your shoulder.
Bend that front knee.

29:46.246 --> 29:48.155
Back straight.

29:51.251 --> 29:53.167
And...

29:56.163 --> 29:58.244
You're getting closer.
You're definitely getting closer.

30:01.199 --> 30:04.240
I always thought it would be
my own son I'd teach to shoot.

30:08.215 --> 30:10.184
I liked Gabriel.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.164
We used to play together.

30:12.163 --> 30:13.239
I know you did.

30:17.219 --> 30:20.216
So you'll have to be
a bit of a son to me

30:20.215 --> 30:23.172
and I'll do my best
to be a bit of a father to you.

30:23.170 --> 30:24.203
How does that sound?

30:27.211 --> 30:30.196
I said I don't belong here.

30:31.195 --> 30:33.156
You do belong here, Charlie.

30:34.239 --> 30:37.169
Don't let anyone tell you
any different.

30:39.174 --> 30:42.164
What are you doing?

30:48.199 --> 30:49.232
Put the gun down.

30:50.251 --> 30:53.172
Put it down.

30:55.183 --> 30:56.252
HE FIRES TWICE

30:58.235 --> 31:00.236
Why did you do that?

31:00.235 --> 31:02.195
Why did you do that, Charlie?

31:02.195 --> 31:04.160
They've seen him.

31:05.207 --> 31:08.228
What are you talking about?
Gabriel. They've seen him.

31:12.195 --> 31:14.172
Where have they seen him?

31:15.175 --> 31:16.252
Standing by the lake.

31:18.183 --> 31:19.216
Right where he drowned.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.200
Charlie!

31:31.163 --> 31:32.187
David...

31:33.187 --> 31:34.239
Harrington...

31:36.207 --> 31:38.184
Abraham...

31:39.183 --> 31:40.236
Henry...

31:42.203 --> 31:44.160
Benjamin...

31:45.203 --> 31:48.184
I suppose the sun is over
the yardarm somewhere in the world.

31:48.183 --> 31:50.196
THEY CHUCKLE

31:50.195 --> 31:52.228
Your very good health. And yours.

32:07.228 --> 32:09.197
Do you believe in ghosts, Denning?

32:15.183 --> 32:20.165
Ghosts? Charlie said something
about seeing my son.

32:20.163 --> 32:22.208
Charlie wants to get your attention,

32:22.207 --> 32:26.217
so he says the one thing
that is guaranteed to do just that.

32:28.216 --> 32:31.161
One night, in Shepzoy, I saw...

32:31.159 --> 32:33.180
a woman.

32:34.183 --> 32:38.241
What sort of woman?
She had a book of light in her hand.

32:38.239 --> 32:40.236
Well, who was she? I have no idea.

32:40.236 --> 32:42.253
But Gabriel drew a picture
of a woman with a book,

32:42.252 --> 32:45.177
and so did Harriet.

32:45.175 --> 32:51.202
Are you seriously telling me
you all saw a ghost? The same ghost?

32:51.200 --> 32:53.249
When I was looking
for Charlie, I saw lights

32:53.248 --> 32:56.173
rushing towards me down the lane.

32:56.172 --> 33:00.194
What are you telling me?
You... You saw...a-a vision?

33:00.192 --> 33:03.173
Angels? No. I don't know.

33:04.211 --> 33:08.209
In all your years of dealing with the
dead and the dying and the bereaved...

33:08.208 --> 33:10.249
have you ever seen anything
that you could not explain?

33:12.212 --> 33:13.240
Never.

33:17.212 --> 33:19.213
Now, that was a good day's work.

33:19.212 --> 33:22.173
Time for a touch of the good stuff
at the Wheatsheaf, I reckon.

33:22.172 --> 33:24.237
When was the last time you didn't
end your day at the Wheatsheaf?

33:24.236 --> 33:28.198
Sunday, ma'am.
Cos they're not open on Sundays!

33:28.196 --> 33:31.205
LAUGHING: He don't like that!
Not strong enough!

33:33.216 --> 33:34.241
Ma'am...

33:34.240 --> 33:37.161
MAN: Where's Mr Appleby?

33:38.228 --> 33:41.166
I'm his wife. Can I help you?

33:42.204 --> 33:43.224
SCREAM

33:43.224 --> 33:47.186
How would you explain...
the woman in my house?

33:47.184 --> 33:48.237
A trick of the light.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.173
The brain...

33:52.172 --> 33:56.182
is an amazing and mischievous organ.

33:56.180 --> 33:58.217
Mm-hm!
Er, who keeps telling me that?

33:58.216 --> 33:59.248
I know, I know.

33:59.248 --> 34:02.242
Anyway, I thought
you were supposed to be a scientist.

34:03.244 --> 34:05.209
So did I.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.177
Mrs Appleby, sir!

34:16.199 --> 34:18.217
MUFFLED DISTRESSED NOISES

34:25.165 --> 34:27.178
NOISES CONTINUE

34:37.179 --> 34:40.248
HE MAKES DISTRESSED NOISES

34:40.248 --> 34:42.208
Charlie?

34:44.244 --> 34:47.237
What can be so bad, my brave man?

34:49.228 --> 34:51.157
Hmm?

34:55.221 --> 34:57.170
Are you my mother?

34:58.236 --> 35:00.161
What?

35:02.181 --> 35:04.162
Course I am. What a thing to say!

35:05.180 --> 35:08.209
They said I don't
belong to you...or the village.

35:10.156 --> 35:12.193
Who said that?
These...wretched boys?

35:14.221 --> 35:16.218
Then they are liars!

35:17.224 --> 35:20.226
I am your mother
and this is where you belong.

35:30.217 --> 35:32.246
Where is she? In here, sir.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.221
Are you hurt?

35:38.220 --> 35:41.186
I'm fine. You promise me?

35:41.185 --> 35:43.210
He didn't hurt me, Nathan.
Where is he?

35:43.209 --> 35:46.242
He's a very old, very confused man.
Where is he? Charlotte!

35:46.241 --> 35:50.159
Please, Nathan. For me.

36:01.216 --> 36:05.246
My name is Nathan Appleby.
I'm the master of Shepzoy House.

36:05.245 --> 36:07.222
What are you doing here?

36:07.221 --> 36:09.210
They've started again.

36:11.205 --> 36:13.222
After all...these...years.

36:13.221 --> 36:15.254
What has started again?

36:15.253 --> 36:19.230
The voices. Pulling me back here.

36:19.229 --> 36:23.211
When I was a boy
I worked in the Appleby mine.

36:23.209 --> 36:25.190
There's no Appleby mine.

36:25.189 --> 36:29.235
They used us boys
from the workhouse in Taunton.

36:29.233 --> 36:31.221
Never the village lads.

36:31.221 --> 36:34.203
Don't risk the village lads.

36:35.205 --> 36:37.182
It was a terrible place.

36:38.214 --> 36:42.175
Hot as hell and black as the devil.

36:43.177 --> 36:46.218
Every hour, on the hour...

36:46.217 --> 36:49.202
we called out to each other,

36:49.201 --> 36:52.167
to let us know we were all safe.

36:54.185 --> 36:55.226
David...

36:57.225 --> 36:59.158
Harrington...

37:00.217 --> 37:02.202
Abraham...

37:03.217 --> 37:05.178
BOTH: Henry...

37:07.201 --> 37:09.190
Benjamin...

37:15.182 --> 37:17.218
BOY'S VOICE: Come and play.

37:17.217 --> 37:19.210
SECOND BOY'S VOICE: Come on, Charlie.

37:19.209 --> 37:20.234
Not tonight.

37:22.162 --> 37:24.215
I don't want to play tonight.

37:24.214 --> 37:26.186
Come and play, Charlie.

37:26.185 --> 37:28.238
Come with us.

37:33.185 --> 37:35.218
Come on, Charlie.

37:36.242 --> 37:38.203
You don't belong with them.

37:45.186 --> 37:47.186
You belong with us.

37:54.182 --> 37:56.162
We're coming for you, Charlie.

37:58.253 --> 38:00.250
WHISPERED BOYS' VOICES MINGLE

38:03.225 --> 38:06.231
Come on, Charlie. Get in, Charlie.

38:06.230 --> 38:09.183
BOYS SING

38:09.182 --> 38:12.215
I was the last one
to join the gang...

38:12.213 --> 38:15.195
so they was always the pushers

38:15.194 --> 38:17.167
and I was always the trapper.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.218
The trapper?

38:18.218 --> 38:20.203
The worst job in the mine.

38:20.202 --> 38:23.179
The trapper's job
was to open and close the flap

38:23.178 --> 38:26.179
so that air
did get into the tunnels.

38:27.230 --> 38:29.203
12 hours...

38:30.214 --> 38:31.251
..in a hole...

38:33.202 --> 38:36.187
..no bigger than a child's coffin.

38:36.186 --> 38:38.219
HE WHIMPERS

38:44.225 --> 38:47.175
LATCH CLUNKS, CREAKING

38:49.213 --> 38:52.223
SEVERAL BOYS' VOICES:
Come on, Charlie. Come with us.

38:59.190 --> 39:02.243
BOYS HUM

39:02.242 --> 39:05.167
Charlie's coming.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.227
Charlie's coming. Shhh!

39:07.226 --> 39:08.255
Charlie's coming.

39:10.158 --> 39:12.218
FLOORBOARDS CREAK

39:36.226 --> 39:38.231
HE SNIFFS

39:41.202 --> 39:43.243
Mother...

39:47.210 --> 39:49.223
You don't belong with them.

39:58.222 --> 40:01.168
That last day,
I couldn't stand it any longer.

40:01.167 --> 40:03.164
The darkness.

40:03.163 --> 40:05.236
The terrible weight of it
on my eyes.

40:08.179 --> 40:10.244
I was nine years old, sir.

40:10.243 --> 40:12.240
No mother or father of my own.

40:33.239 --> 40:36.176
I was climbing up to the surface,

40:36.174 --> 40:38.179
to the sunlight...

40:39.186 --> 40:41.207
..even though I knew
I would be beaten.

40:43.242 --> 40:48.192
Then I heard...
the whole valley rumble.

40:50.159 --> 40:52.180
The mine was caving in.

40:53.182 --> 40:57.192
When there is a landslip,
the men on the surface

40:57.190 --> 41:01.244
shout down to the trapper,
who sounds the alarm, but...

41:01.243 --> 41:04.248
I-I wasn't in the coffin.

41:04.246 --> 41:08.216
S-S-So the boys...
never got their warning.

41:08.215 --> 41:13.169
I ran over to the office
to alert the overseers.

41:13.167 --> 41:14.224
Old man Appleby was there.

41:14.223 --> 41:16.183
My great-grandfather?

41:16.182 --> 41:21.257
I-I was screaming and screaming
at him, "Help the boys!

41:21.255 --> 41:24.168
"Help the boys!"

41:24.167 --> 41:27.192
But he said...
it was too difficult...

41:28.211 --> 41:31.208
..too...expensive to dig 'em out.

41:32.254 --> 41:35.164
They died, sir.

41:36.163 --> 41:39.168
Every...one.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.180
I could hear them...

41:44.159 --> 41:45.163
..screaming...

41:46.246 --> 41:48.171
..and crying...

41:49.167 --> 41:50.187
..for days.

41:51.243 --> 41:53.231
And then...

41:55.195 --> 41:56.236
..it stopped.

41:59.227 --> 42:02.216
They were only workhouse boys.
What did it matter?

42:04.247 --> 42:09.189
And now...I hear them again.

42:09.187 --> 42:11.188
My God.

42:11.187 --> 42:12.252
M...

42:12.251 --> 42:13.255
My...

42:15.231 --> 42:19.221
..poor, poor...angry boys.

42:22.251 --> 42:24.212
HE SOBS

42:27.167 --> 42:28.200
Charlie's missing.

42:31.195 --> 42:33.204
The tunnel opens into a system
of other tunnels,

42:33.203 --> 42:35.216
unstable at the best of times.

42:35.215 --> 42:38.168
You're not even sure
he's down there.

42:38.167 --> 42:39.239
He is down there.

42:41.187 --> 42:43.172
The tunnels were built
for small children.

42:43.171 --> 42:45.192
In places, they'll be barely
three feet wide.

42:45.191 --> 42:48.196
If you do get through, there'll be
little or no oxygen. It's madness.

42:54.191 --> 42:55.219
What are you doing?

42:55.219 --> 42:59.185
Coming with you. Charlie is
my responsibility as much as yours.

43:01.167 --> 43:04.180
If you're not back soon,
I'm coming in after you.

43:11.227 --> 43:13.236
You'll find him, sir.

43:13.235 --> 43:16.189
You'll find my boy. I know you will.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.201
"And the earth opened her mouth...

43:40.200 --> 43:42.237
"and swallowed 'em up."

43:47.200 --> 43:50.169
Mr Smith, I want you
to shore this entrance up.

43:50.167 --> 43:53.253
Gideon, take some men
and help them. Ma'am.

43:53.252 --> 43:56.233
Gwen, go up to the house
and get food and drink.

43:56.232 --> 43:58.221
Yes, ma'am. Lamps.

43:58.220 --> 44:01.181
All the lamps we have.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.165
The air's so thin.
HE COUGHS

44:23.228 --> 44:25.161
Shh-shh.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.224
Did you hear that?

44:26.224 --> 44:29.257
I can just hear the sound
of my own blood pounding in my ears.

44:29.256 --> 44:31.161
Charlie!

44:33.168 --> 44:36.177
We have to push on. Can you do it?
Lead the way.

44:56.216 --> 44:57.240
It opens up.

45:01.180 --> 45:02.185
Thank God.

45:08.256 --> 45:11.238
Wait! Appleby, wait!

45:13.168 --> 45:14.253
Charlie.

45:18.237 --> 45:21.174
What was he like, ma'am,
when you first met Mr Appleby?

45:23.220 --> 45:25.233
He was a dashing young man,

45:25.233 --> 45:29.170
running around London,
devoted to his patients,

45:29.168 --> 45:30.245
full of new and radical ideas.

45:32.161 --> 45:33.213
Lectures and parties.

45:34.221 --> 45:36.245
And then when I finally got him
to stop for a moment,

45:36.244 --> 45:39.178
I saw something else.

45:39.177 --> 45:40.197
A sadness.

45:42.256 --> 45:44.181
Gabriel?

45:45.248 --> 45:49.182
I promised myself I would love
that sadness out of him.

45:51.192 --> 45:53.229
Not to forget Gabriel - never that.

45:55.213 --> 45:57.254
To surround him
with our own...children...

45:59.200 --> 46:01.165
..bring him that joy again.

46:02.197 --> 46:05.194
And so you shall, ma'am.
I'm sure of it.

46:11.253 --> 46:13.242
Charlie!

46:19.176 --> 46:20.225
Charlie!

46:24.220 --> 46:26.245
We can't stop. We can't stop here.

46:26.244 --> 46:29.257
HE PANTS
Just...one moment. Please.

46:31.168 --> 46:34.186
It's no... It's no use, man.
If the boy came down here...

46:35.229 --> 46:36.246
Charlie!

46:38.172 --> 46:39.193
METALLIC CLINK

46:48.225 --> 46:51.178
So this God of yours, Denning -

46:51.177 --> 46:54.194
absent or merely cruel?

46:54.192 --> 46:57.258
Shall the thing formed
say to him that formed it,

46:57.257 --> 46:59.218
"Why hast thou made me thus?"?

46:59.217 --> 47:03.166
Then, "Don't ask questions,"
is that what you're saying?

47:03.165 --> 47:06.187
I will ask questions.
I will never stop.

47:08.188 --> 47:10.221
Hold the lamp high.

47:10.221 --> 47:12.238
There's more oxygen near the roof.

47:47.165 --> 47:49.190
Abraham...

48:07.197 --> 48:08.258
Oh, they're all children.

48:15.170 --> 48:16.174
Oh, dear God.

48:18.181 --> 48:19.245
Oh...

48:19.245 --> 48:21.190
OLD MAN: Harrington...

48:23.221 --> 48:25.218
HE WHEEZES
Benjamin...

48:31.198 --> 48:32.242
Henry...

48:35.169 --> 48:40.199
I am the resurrection and the life,
saith the Lord.

48:40.197 --> 48:45.216
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,

48:45.214 --> 48:47.174
yet shall he live.

48:48.178 --> 48:49.186
Charlie?!

48:50.246 --> 48:55.224
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die.

48:57.258 --> 48:59.255
I know that my Redeemer liveth...

49:02.170 --> 49:04.255
..and that he shall stand
at the latter day...

49:06.226 --> 49:09.199
Charlie?! ..upon the earth.

49:10.245 --> 49:12.178
And though after my skin...

49:13.178 --> 49:14.246
..worms destroy this body...

49:16.226 --> 49:19.247
..yet in my flesh...

49:19.245 --> 49:21.190
shall I see God.

49:26.217 --> 49:27.222
Charlie?

51:00.210 --> 51:02.183
The poor boy.

51:04.206 --> 51:07.199
CREAKING AND RUMBLING

51:09.190 --> 51:11.215
We have to get out! Now!

51:11.214 --> 51:13.191
CREAKING
What was that?

51:15.203 --> 51:18.248
Just the ground settling,
Mrs Appleby, nothing more.

51:18.246 --> 51:20.191
I'll be the judge of that.

51:25.206 --> 51:27.255
Nathan...

51:27.254 --> 51:29.199
if we don't get out now...

51:31.167 --> 51:32.207
..we are going to die.

51:35.199 --> 51:36.215
Please.

51:36.215 --> 51:38.208
PLANKS CLATTER

51:38.207 --> 51:40.224
Landslip! Get out! Now!
Mrs Appleby...

51:40.223 --> 51:41.239
Nathan?

51:46.234 --> 51:47.255
Nathan!

51:47.255 --> 51:49.232
GHOSTLY VOICE: Daddy.

51:50.234 --> 51:53.203
Daddy.

51:57.203 --> 51:59.196
Daddy.

52:00.214 --> 52:01.219
Gabriel.

52:29.239 --> 52:32.212
DENNING COUGHS

52:52.239 --> 52:55.172
SHE WAILS

53:21.211 --> 53:23.175
Charlie...

53:38.195 --> 53:41.164
HAMMERING

53:46.227 --> 53:48.216
HAMMERING

53:50.187 --> 53:52.260
I heard Gabriel's voice.

53:54.239 --> 53:58.185
He trusted me and I let him down.
It was an accident.

54:03.235 --> 54:05.256
Every sleeping moment of my life...

54:07.192 --> 54:08.216
..I've dreamt of him.

54:11.243 --> 54:15.201
Waiting for me by the lake...
launching his boat...

54:15.199 --> 54:17.220
Nathan. Then terrified.

54:19.168 --> 54:21.197
Shouting out for me.

54:23.204 --> 54:26.233
It was the water in his lungs.
Do not torture yourself.

54:26.232 --> 54:28.197
And now I've failed Charlie, too.

54:28.196 --> 54:30.213
You have nothing
to reproach yourself for.

54:30.212 --> 54:33.189
I refused to believe
what he was telling me.

54:33.188 --> 54:34.220
That there are ghosts?

54:41.231 --> 54:43.184
I...

54:55.171 --> 54:57.220
I heard Gabriel's voice.

55:00.192 --> 55:03.221
I am...sure of it.

55:07.164 --> 55:09.205
You said yourself
you were short of oxygen.

55:09.204 --> 55:11.176
Yes.

55:11.175 --> 55:13.208
You were seeing things,
hearing things.

55:15.252 --> 55:17.181
There are no ghosts.

55:18.187 --> 55:19.252
There's just you and me.

55:21.168 --> 55:23.229
And we're alive, Nathan Appleby.

55:25.240 --> 55:27.164
We are alive.

57:25.213 --> 57:27.186
There's something here.

57:27.185 --> 57:28.217
Something bad.

57:28.217 --> 57:31.214
This place is damned.
Ever since you returned.

57:33.196 --> 57:35.201
I heard her. I saw her.

57:36.252 --> 57:38.169
CHARLOTTE: I wonder,

57:38.168 --> 57:40.237
when you're helping people,
what else you're looking for.

57:41.237 --> 57:43.206
Gabriel.

57:47.285 --> 57:53.288
# I am stretched upon your grave

57:53.288 --> 58:00.303
# And I will lie here forever

58:00.303 --> 58:07.250
# If your hands were in mine

58:07.250 --> 58:16.258
# I'd be sure
they would not sever... #
