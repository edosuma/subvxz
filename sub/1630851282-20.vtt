- This belongs to you,

21:32.448 --> 21:34.034
but this isn't over.

21:34.103 --> 21:37.551
See you around, Little Fishey.

21:37.620 --> 21:41.551
- Talk to you later, Trasha.

21:41.620 --> 21:43.620
- That was pretty good.

21:43.689 --> 21:45.896
- Boom. Fisher is back, baby.

21:50.379 --> 21:52.620
- I'm so proud of you,
Fisher.

21:52.689 --> 21:53.793
I knew you could do it.

21:53.862 --> 21:55.137
- Thanks for making that robot
terrible

21:55.206 --> 21:56.896
on purpose to snap me out of it.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.344
- Wait, you knew?

21:58.413 --> 22:03.068
- Friendly reminder. I'm a
genius, and a champion.
