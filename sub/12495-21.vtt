WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:08.759
(sirens wailing)

00:09.134 --> 00:10.093
(Henry)

00:09.134 --> 00:10.093
Hey!

00:10.594 --> 00:12.262
Hey, I got another one!

00:16.308 --> 00:18.978
(Captain Man)

00:16.308 --> 00:18.978
Aw, what a cute baby.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.189
Aw,

00:19.770 --> 00:22.189
aren't you a cute little guy?

00:22.230 --> 00:23.148
Here.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.320
Man, how many babies

00:25.901 --> 00:28.320
did she have down there?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.198
I'm not sure.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.198
I'll check for more.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.533
Hello?

00:32.867 --> 00:34.368
Any more babies down here?

00:34.952 --> 00:35.828
Hello?

00:39.665 --> 00:42.001
Ma'am, can I talk with you?

00:42.584 --> 00:43.502
What?

00:45.086 --> 00:46.463
Could you stop eating

00:45.086 --> 00:46.463
the cheese for a minute?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.927
Did you really think

00:49.800 --> 00:51.927
it was a good idea

00:51.969 --> 00:53.846
to crawl down into a sewer

00:51.969 --> 00:53.846
to give birth?

00:55.096 --> 00:56.515
That's how we do it

00:55.096 --> 00:56.515
where I come from.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.476
Where do you come from?

00:59.518 --> 01:00.561
The sewer!

01:04.272 --> 01:05.399
Okay.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.608
I think this is the last baby.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.196
Hey, kid, why don't you

01:09.737 --> 01:11.196
knock off and go home?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.280
You sure?

01:12.322 --> 01:13.615
Yeah, it's already past midnight

01:13.657 --> 01:14.992
and you got school

01:13.657 --> 01:14.992
in the morning.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.326
(Woman)

01:15.325 --> 01:16.326
Oh!

01:17.494 --> 01:18.161
I think I'm going

01:17.494 --> 01:18.161
to have me another baby!

01:18.203 --> 01:19.371
Oh, no.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.706
I got to get back in that sewer!

01:20.748 --> 01:21.749
No, no, no.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.333
(yelling)

01:24.877 --> 01:26.253
(screaming)

01:47.274 --> 01:48.984
(screaming)

01:51.612 --> 01:52.780
Why would you do that?

01:53.196 --> 01:55.490
Where have you been

01:53.196 --> 01:55.490
and why are you sneaking

01:55.532 --> 01:57.701
into your room at...

01:55.532 --> 01:57.701
one in the morning?

01:58.953 --> 02:01.246
Because... I was out...

02:02.163 --> 02:03.123
Moon bathing.

02:04.917 --> 02:05.876
Moon bathing?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.628
Yeah.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.921
Check out my moon tan.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.008
I'm telling mom and dad

02:10.965 --> 02:13.008
you snuck out.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.677
Fine. Tell them.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.596
No, please don't

02:15.719 --> 02:17.596
I will.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.348
Come on, I'm a nice brother,

02:20.933 --> 02:23.894
and you're so sweet and cute.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.145
You don't want

02:23.936 --> 02:25.145
to get me in trouble.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.230
Please? Promise me?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.399
All right.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.526
I promise.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.865
Henry snuck out

02:34.863 --> 02:36.865
of his room last night

02:36.907 --> 02:39.868
and didn't sneak back in

02:36.907 --> 02:39.868
until one in the morning.

02:39.910 --> 02:40.828
(gasping)

02:44.289 --> 02:47.042
Well, last Saturday night

02:44.289 --> 02:47.042
while you guys were out,

02:47.084 --> 02:49.837
Piper and her friend Marla

02:47.084 --> 02:49.837
watched "French basement."

02:49.878 --> 02:50.796
(gasping)

02:52.798 --> 02:53.757
(Mr. Hart)

02:52.798 --> 02:53.757
Piper.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.634
That movie is rated R.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.928
You know you're not allowed

02:55.676 --> 02:57.928
to watch R-rated movies.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.765
Come on, I didn't hear

02:57.970 --> 03:01.765
anything I hadn't heard before.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.684
(Mrs. Hart)

03:01.807 --> 03:03.684
Well, guess what?

03:03.725 --> 03:05.268
You're both grounded

03:03.725 --> 03:05.268
for two weeks.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.146
Oh, come on.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.606
I said, boom!

03:09.648 --> 03:11.692
(laughs)

03:13.027 --> 03:14.277
It all just kind of happened.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.321
My dad was

03:14.319 --> 03:16.321
an irresponsible scientist.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.740
I wanted an after-school job.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.326
(Captain Man)

03:18.782 --> 03:21.326
And by accident,

03:18.782 --> 03:21.326
he made me indestructible.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.661
Ah!

03:22.703 --> 03:24.663
(Henry)

03:22.703 --> 03:24.663
I went into this crazy store

03:25.080 --> 03:26.915
and met

03:25.080 --> 03:26.915
a pretty interesting guy.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.000
I'm going to blow your mind.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.045
(Captain Man)

03:29.626 --> 03:31.045
Now I protect

03:29.626 --> 03:31.045
the good citizens of Swellview

03:31.086 --> 03:32.087
who call me...

03:32.129 --> 03:33.254
(Henry)

03:32.129 --> 03:33.254
And he turned out to be...

03:33.296 --> 03:34.255
(Captain Man)

03:33.296 --> 03:34.255
You know the name.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.341
Captain Man!That's right, Henry.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.094
(Captain Man)

03:36.383 --> 03:39.094
In time, I realized

03:36.383 --> 03:39.094
that being a superhero

03:39.136 --> 03:40.345
is a lot to handle alone.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.763
He wanted some help.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.223
(Captain Man)

03:41.805 --> 03:43.223
I needed a sidekick.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.808
(Henry)

03:43.264 --> 03:44.808
I, Henry hart...

03:44.850 --> 03:46.101
(Captain Man)

03:44.850 --> 03:46.101
Pledge to never ever ever...

03:44.850 --> 03:46.101
tell anyone...

03:46.143 --> 03:48.896
That I'm Captain Man's

03:46.143 --> 03:48.896
It is done.ecret sidekick.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.313
(Henry)

03:48.937 --> 03:50.313
Now we blow bubbles.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.523
(Captain Man)

03:50.355 --> 03:51.523
And fight crime.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.524
(Henry)

03:51.565 --> 03:52.524
Feels good.

03:53.692 --> 03:58.613
(music)

04:07.164 --> 04:09.249
Up the tube!

04:10.250 --> 04:10.876
(Henry)

04:10.250 --> 04:10.876
Oh, my boot.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.753
(Captain Man)

04:11.543 --> 04:12.753
Ha!

04:19.467 --> 04:20.677
(elevator dings)

04:26.183 --> 04:27.101
Hey, Ray.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.476
Ray?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.104
Sniff this flower.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.355
All right.

04:33.941 --> 04:34.566
(sniffs)

04:34.608 --> 04:35.483
Mm.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.444
Smells nice.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.444
What is that, a Daffodil?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.196
(laughing)

04:40.614 --> 04:41.990
Dang daggit, Schwoz!

04:43.491 --> 04:44.659
You got problems!

04:44.701 --> 04:45.744
(screaming)

04:47.079 --> 04:48.247
(thud)

04:48.288 --> 04:49.164
(elevator dings)

04:54.878 --> 04:56.213
Smells like something

04:54.878 --> 04:56.213
blew up in here.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.923
(chuckling)

04:57.965 --> 04:58.882
You're a sick person.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.009
(ringing)

05:02.219 --> 05:03.887
That's Henry.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.887
He wants to hologram chat.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.222
I'll take it.

05:05.847 --> 05:06.974
(ringing)

05:08.475 --> 05:09.851
Hey, Henry, what's up?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.229
Bad news, I can't come

05:10.393 --> 05:12.229
to work for the next two weeks.

05:13.272 --> 05:13.939
Okay.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.233
I'm really sorry,

05:14.940 --> 05:16.233
but I got grounded

05:16.275 --> 05:17.525
and my parents are

05:16.275 --> 05:17.525
only letting me go to school.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.443
That's it.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.487
I volunteer to fill in

05:19.611 --> 05:20.487
as your sidekick.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.739
Come on.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.075
We could be

05:22.781 --> 05:25.075
Captain Man and Schwozzam!

05:25.366 --> 05:25.951
Gross.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.868
Doh.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.164
I'm sorry, kid,

05:28.536 --> 05:30.164
what were we talking about?

05:30.747 --> 05:32.040
I was telling you

05:30.747 --> 05:32.040
that I'm grounded

05:32.082 --> 05:34.209
so I can't be your sidekick

05:32.082 --> 05:34.209
for two whole weeks.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.710
Oh, yeah. Bummer.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.504
I had an important job

05:36.211 --> 05:37.504
for you today.

05:37.838 --> 05:38.463
What?

05:39.547 --> 05:41.258
There's this new

05:39.547 --> 05:41.258
barbecue place downtown.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.426
I was going to get you

05:41.300 --> 05:43.426
to pick me up a slab of ribs.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.220
I'll order some ribs

05:44.011 --> 05:45.220
and have them delivered.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.930
Cool.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.930
Later, Henry.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.974
But...

05:49.016 --> 05:50.892
But who's going to help you

05:49.016 --> 05:50.892
fight crime while I'm grounded?

05:50.934 --> 05:51.852
I can handle things.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.521
Ray, you want beef ribs or pork?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.940
Pork.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.940
Henry, I got to go.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.442
- But...

05:57.816 --> 05:59.442
- Bye Henry.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.029
Wait, I--

06:03.613 --> 06:04.614
I want ribs.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.825
(laughs)

06:12.289 --> 06:13.748
(Piper)

06:12.289 --> 06:13.748
I hate being grounded.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.334
Thanks a lot.

06:15.374 --> 06:16.960
Well,

06:15.374 --> 06:16.960
I wouldn't have told on you

06:17.002 --> 06:18.586
if you hadn't told on me.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.421
Okay, well, how about this?

06:21.006 --> 06:22.007
Piper, you better not--

06:29.348 --> 06:30.807
What happened to your couch?

06:32.309 --> 06:33.810
(Henry)

06:32.309 --> 06:33.810
Just help me, please.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.859
Thank you.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.195
(Mr. Hart)

06:41.943 --> 06:43.195
Hey!

06:43.237 --> 06:45.488
What's Jasper doing here?

06:43.237 --> 06:45.488
You're grounded.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.448
Mom said that Jasper

06:45.947 --> 06:47.448
and Charlotte

06:47.490 --> 06:48.116
can still come over.

06:49.159 --> 06:49.826
No one asked me

06:49.159 --> 06:49.826
how I feel about it.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.370
That is true.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.374
Henry's going to help me

06:53.288 --> 06:55.374
make life hack videos.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.541
No, I'm not.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.086
What are life hack videos?

06:59.127 --> 07:01.213
Oh, you're so old.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.716
A life hack is when, like,

07:02.589 --> 07:04.716
when you have a problem,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.718
you know,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.718
it's like a cool quick fix.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.428
Right.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.428
Like, let's say you got to pee,

07:09.470 --> 07:10.847
but there's no bathroom nearby.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.974
Pee in a jar.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.059
Life hack.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.479
I'm going for a walk.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.857
You want to take

07:18.897 --> 07:20.857
a jar with you?

07:22.483 --> 07:23.360
All right.

07:25.987 --> 07:26.905
You ready?

07:28.282 --> 07:29.783
I really don't want to help you

07:28.282 --> 07:29.783
make life hack videos.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.451
Yeah, you do.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.827
(laughs)

07:32.869 --> 07:34.288
I really don't.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.039
Go.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.668
Need to brush your teeth,

07:37.958 --> 07:40.668
but you're out of toothpaste?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.130
Get some mayonnaise.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.590
Pick some fresh mint

07:44.005 --> 07:45.590
from your garden.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.053
Grab some sand from a beach

07:47.550 --> 07:50.053
or a playground.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.973
Combine and blend.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.436
Life hack.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.566
Or you could just go buy

08:01.064 --> 08:03.566
some more toothpaste.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.778
Just turn off the camera.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.447
Taste good?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.990
Just turn off the camera!

08:10.031 --> 08:11.408
(coughing)

08:11.450 --> 08:12.826
God, it's awful!

08:20.959 --> 08:22.377
So,

08:20.959 --> 08:22.377
you have two children?

08:22.419 --> 08:24.504
Oh, yes,

08:22.419 --> 08:24.504
we sure do.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.840
My son is

08:24.545 --> 08:26.840
Fabulous kids.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.259
(Henry)

08:26.881 --> 08:29.259
Hey! Don't you close that door!

08:26.881 --> 08:29.259
I mean it!

08:29.301 --> 08:30.802
Sorry, what did you say?

08:33.888 --> 08:35.182
Piper, is there a problem?

08:35.223 --> 08:36.724
Yes.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.685
On the way home from school,

08:36.766 --> 08:38.685
Henry kept trying to talk to me.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.689
You slammed the door

08:41.355 --> 08:42.689
in my face!

08:42.730 --> 08:43.564
Hey, stop, stop.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.941
But she makes me so mad.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.734
You know,

08:44.983 --> 08:46.734
I'm going upstairs.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.986
You know, go, then.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.491
They don't really talk

08:50.322 --> 08:52.491
to each other that way.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.993
They're just rehearsing

08:52.532 --> 08:54.993
for a school play.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.204
Are you lying to us?

08:57.245 --> 08:58.205
Yes.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.376
Henry, I'd like you to meet

09:00.415 --> 09:02.376
Elaine Morongo

09:02.417 --> 09:03.710
and Parnell Chewmash.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.339
They're in charge

09:05.462 --> 09:07.339
of swellviewtoday.com.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.631
They might pick us

09:08.673 --> 09:10.967
to be the Swellview

09:08.673 --> 09:10.967
family of the week.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.470
And if they do, we all get to be

09:11.009 --> 09:13.470
on the homepage.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.014
Wow, that'd be amazing.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.058
Are you being sarcastic?

09:18.599 --> 09:19.476
Yes.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.689
Hey, Hen,

09:22.562 --> 09:24.689
why don't you go upstairs

09:24.731 --> 09:25.857
and donate

09:24.731 --> 09:25.857
some of your allowance

09:25.899 --> 09:28.193
to poor people, as you often do?

09:29.444 --> 09:31.405
I don't want to go upstairs.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.405
Piper's up there.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.739
Go upstairs nowI'll be upstairs.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.285
Kids, you know how they can be.

09:37.827 --> 09:38.995
No.

09:39.037 --> 09:39.954
I don't have children.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.290
Neither do I.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.959
My husband left me

09:42.332 --> 09:44.959
on our wedding night.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.628
Uh...

09:49.381 --> 09:50.465
We don't know what to say now.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.800
(television gunshots)

09:52.842 --> 09:53.801
(Man)

09:52.842 --> 09:53.801
Oh!

09:53.843 --> 09:55.303
(Henry)

09:53.843 --> 09:55.303
Turn it down!

09:55.345 --> 09:57.013
(Piper)

09:55.345 --> 09:57.013
Hey! Give me my remote!

09:58.348 --> 09:59.307
Hey!

09:59.349 --> 10:00.600
Will you tell Piper

10:00.641 --> 10:02.436
that if she wants to watch

10:00.641 --> 10:02.436
a movie in her room,

10:02.477 --> 10:04.812
then she can't turn the volume

10:02.477 --> 10:04.812
all the way up?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.523
Mom,

10:04.854 --> 10:06.523
Henry took my remote

10:06.565 --> 10:07.899
All right,d he won't

10:06.565 --> 10:07.899
both of you,e it back!

10:07.941 --> 10:08.900
not another word!

10:11.611 --> 10:13.071
Would either of you

10:11.611 --> 10:13.071
like some soup?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.115
(laughs)

10:15.407 --> 10:17.742
Actually, we have to go.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.202
We're late for another meeting.

10:19.994 --> 10:20.661
Are you lying?

10:21.121 --> 10:21.829
Yes.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.502
Oh, now they hate us.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.502
You guys hate us, don't you?

10:28.044 --> 10:30.713
Look, why don't we come back

10:30.755 --> 10:32.966
and finish our interview

10:30.755 --> 10:32.966
tomorrow afternoon?

10:33.007 --> 10:33.674
Really?

10:33.716 --> 10:34.717
That'd be fab.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.889
You guys almost kept us

10:39.931 --> 10:41.057
from being

10:39.931 --> 10:41.057
on a really cool website.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.017
Well, it's not our fault.

10:43.059 --> 10:43.977
Yeah.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.395
Why isn't it?

10:45.437 --> 10:47.105
(laughs)

10:47.147 --> 10:49.816
Because we've been cooped up

10:47.147 --> 10:49.816
in this house for five days,

10:49.857 --> 10:51.818
riding to school together,

10:49.857 --> 10:51.818
coming home together.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.860
We can't take it.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.029
Just unground us.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.740
No.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.740
We said two weeks, boom.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.077
Honey, I know you said "boom."

11:02.662 --> 11:03.538
But how about this?

11:04.705 --> 11:05.915
Starting now,

11:07.459 --> 11:08.709
if you two can go one full day

11:07.459 --> 11:08.709
without fighting or arguing,

11:09.169 --> 11:10.295
we will unground you.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.380
Just a day?

11:12.422 --> 11:13.756
A whole day?

11:15.049 --> 11:16.384
Yes.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.095
But if we catch you

11:16.426 --> 11:19.095
fighting or arguing...

11:19.137 --> 11:20.639
You'll be grounded for a month.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.223
Boom.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.184
(laughs)

11:25.768 --> 11:27.103
Hey, Henry,

11:27.145 --> 11:29.189
want to come upstairs

11:27.145 --> 11:29.189
and watch the movie with me?

11:29.897 --> 11:32.567
Well, that sounds

11:29.897 --> 11:32.567
like all kinds of fun.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.529
Here, hold my hand

11:35.570 --> 11:37.614
so you'll be safe

11:35.570 --> 11:37.614
going up the stairs.

11:37.656 --> 11:38.823
Thanks.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.201
You're the sweetest

11:38.865 --> 11:41.201
brother ever.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.620
Well,

11:41.242 --> 11:43.620
you make it easy to be sweet.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.471
Excuse me?

12:02.556 --> 12:03.764
Why? Did you burp?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.394
What are you doing

12:05.892 --> 12:07.394
with my phone cord?

12:07.935 --> 12:10.355
I'm taking it

12:07.935 --> 12:10.355
so I can charge my phone.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.232
No.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.068
I need my cord

12:12.649 --> 12:15.068
to charge my phone.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.111
I need the cord way more

12:15.109 --> 12:17.111
than you need the cord.

12:17.153 --> 12:17.862
Shh!

12:18.446 --> 12:19.822
Why shh?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.784
We only have four hours left

12:21.616 --> 12:23.784
and then we're free.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.453
We can't let mom and dad

12:23.826 --> 12:25.453
catch us fighting

12:25.495 --> 12:26.871
or else we'll blow it.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.332
Right, so quit whining

12:26.913 --> 12:29.332
about your dumb phone cord.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.833
Yes I'm serious.Are you serious?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.419
You can't come

12:30.875 --> 12:32.419
You know what?

12:32.460 --> 12:33.294
Just give me my cord.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.255
(Mrs. Hart)

12:33.336 --> 12:35.255
Henry? Piper?

12:40.343 --> 12:42.679
(both)

12:40.343 --> 12:42.679
We're in here!

12:45.056 --> 12:45.806
Hello.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.811
I thought I heard you arguing.

12:52.105 --> 12:52.813
What?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.316
No, no, no. No.

12:57.902 --> 13:01.573
We're just discussing

12:57.902 --> 13:01.573
Bible verses.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.701
Yes. Amen, brother.

13:07.203 --> 13:07.870
No fighting.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.292
Now, give me the phone cord.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.335
Here, let's share.

13:24.178 --> 13:24.929
What?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.476
(sighs)

13:30.393 --> 13:32.103
Just four more hours.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.772
Just four more--

13:32.479 --> 13:33.772
Ah!

13:42.905 --> 13:44.491
Hi.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.825
Well, since you're grounded,

13:46.867 --> 13:48.536
I thought I'd bring you

13:46.867 --> 13:48.536
a little surprise.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.623
From Yotally Togurt?

13:54.083 --> 13:55.669
Aw, yeah, Fudge Flast.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.129
Thanks, Char.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.590
So,

13:58.755 --> 14:00.590
what's been going on at work?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.091
Oh, you know...

14:02.133 --> 14:04.010
I've been going

14:02.133 --> 14:04.010
through Ray's email,

14:05.011 --> 14:06.721
I did some research

14:05.011 --> 14:06.721
on a few criminals.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.932
Oh, and I went

14:07.806 --> 14:09.932
on patrol with Ray.

14:11.184 --> 14:11.810
You went where?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.103
On patrol.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.689
You know how sometimes

14:14.145 --> 14:15.689
Ray just...

14:16.272 --> 14:19.359
cruises around in the man-copter

14:16.272 --> 14:19.359
making sure the city's okay.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.194
You went up with Ray

14:19.818 --> 14:21.194
in the man-copter?

14:21.235 --> 14:22.320
Yeah.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.154
That's my job.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.990
I'm Kid Danger.

14:26.032 --> 14:26.949
(laughs)

14:26.991 --> 14:28.075
I realize that.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.203
Wow.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.287
What?

14:31.329 --> 14:32.079
Wow!

14:32.997 --> 14:33.790
What?

14:35.082 --> 14:36.626
I just never thought

14:35.082 --> 14:36.626
you'd try to steal my job.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.004
Whoa, whoa there, munchy.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.383
Ray asked me to go on patrol.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.759
And come on, you really think

14:44.801 --> 14:47.261
I'd try and replace you

14:44.801 --> 14:47.261
as Kid Danger?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.639
Nah. You're right.

14:50.139 --> 14:50.765
Thank you.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.893
I could never be

14:52.016 --> 14:53.893
replaced by a girl.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.978
(laughs)

14:59.232 --> 14:59.899
What?

15:00.525 --> 15:01.317
"A girl?"

15:02.360 --> 15:04.195
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.195
I meant young woman.

15:04.237 --> 15:04.904
Same thing!

15:06.698 --> 15:08.157
What's wrong?

15:06.698 --> 15:08.157
I was just saying tha--

15:08.491 --> 15:10.159
Say bye bye to your Fudge Flast.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.202
No, no, no!

15:13.872 --> 15:14.622
Later.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.124
Wait, don't just leave.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.001
You know, I wasn't trying

15:17.166 --> 15:19.001
to take your job before,

15:20.211 --> 15:21.880
but maybe now I will.

15:23.214 --> 15:23.923
Aw, Charlotte!

15:27.802 --> 15:30.263
Aw, that squirrel's eating

15:27.802 --> 15:30.263
my Fudge Flast.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.305
(laughs)

15:31.681 --> 15:33.140
(squirrel squeaking)

15:33.182 --> 15:33.933
Quit that!

15:40.857 --> 15:43.067
(Charlotte screaming)

15:43.109 --> 15:44.026
(thud)

15:44.068 --> 15:44.694
(elevator dings)

15:46.987 --> 15:49.699
Okay, nobody say anything

15:46.987 --> 15:49.699
to upset me.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.284
I don't have time to upset you.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.744
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

15:53.453 --> 15:56.205
There's an illegal pig farm

15:53.453 --> 15:56.205
on the south side of town.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.039
Illegal?

15:57.081 --> 15:58.416
Yep.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.167
There's a very bad

15:58.458 --> 16:00.167
pig farmer out there,

16:00.627 --> 16:02.336
and I'm going to make sure

16:00.627 --> 16:02.336
he goes wee wee wee

16:02.378 --> 16:03.880
all the way to jail.

16:04.923 --> 16:05.965
I'll go with you.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.760
No, Charlotte, this is not

16:07.300 --> 16:08.760
just a routine patrol,

16:08.802 --> 16:10.804
this is a real crime situation

16:08.802 --> 16:10.804
and it could be dangerous.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.389
I get it.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.389
Let me fill in as your sidekick.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.267
You can't be my sidekick.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.267
You're a--

16:16.309 --> 16:16.935
I'm a what?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.229
You're...

16:17.977 --> 16:20.229
Coming with me.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.442
Good. Schwoz, toss me

16:22.231 --> 16:24.442
Henry's backup gumball tube.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.527
Oh, I don't know.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.740
Maybe I'm not qualified

16:27.236 --> 16:30.740
to give gum to people.

16:31.825 --> 16:32.826
Give her the gum!

16:33.159 --> 16:33.827
Doh.

16:38.706 --> 16:39.707
Bubble time.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.134
Huh.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.093
Let's go.

16:51.135 --> 16:51.886
Wait for me.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.058
(both)

16:56.975 --> 16:58.058
Up the tube!

17:08.987 --> 17:09.863
(Piper)

17:08.987 --> 17:09.863
Bye!

17:09.904 --> 17:10.989
(Henry)

17:09.904 --> 17:10.989
Bye!

17:11.030 --> 17:12.824
Wait!

17:11.030 --> 17:12.824
You're still grounded.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.117
No we're not!

17:15.159 --> 17:15.994
Time's up!

17:16.035 --> 17:17.286
No.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.121
You have two more minutes.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.375
Oh, come on,

17:19.539 --> 17:22.375
you don't want to be that mom.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.292
(window knocking)

17:23.334 --> 17:24.836
(Jasper)

17:23.334 --> 17:24.836
Hey! Can I come in?

17:25.461 --> 17:26.212
(door opens)

17:28.464 --> 17:32.301
Okay, who's ready

17:28.464 --> 17:32.301
for another life hack?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.554
Jasper...

17:34.595 --> 17:35.972
We have two people coming

17:34.595 --> 17:35.972
over here to interview us.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.682
And we have to look

17:36.014 --> 17:37.682
like the perfect family.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.475
Okay, I'll leave.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.267
Thank you.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.561
See you.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.270
After I show you this life hack.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.480
Oh.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.692
Okay. You have a vicious dog

17:48.150 --> 17:49.485
and you want to take

17:48.150 --> 17:49.485
him for a walk,

17:49.527 --> 17:50.987
but you don't have a leash.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.948
Just get a bunch

17:51.779 --> 17:53.948
of your mom's bras,

17:53.990 --> 17:56.242
tie them together,

17:53.990 --> 17:56.242
and you got a leash.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.577
Life hack.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.912
(laughs)

17:58.953 --> 18:00.663
Okay, that's pretty smart.

18:00.705 --> 18:01.998
(laughs)

18:04.876 --> 18:06.669
I'm sorry,

18:04.876 --> 18:06.669
but did you say come in?

18:06.711 --> 18:07.294
I thought I heard--

18:07.336 --> 18:08.295
(dog barking)

18:08.337 --> 18:10.048
(screaming)

18:13.718 --> 18:15.094
(screaming)

18:18.097 --> 18:19.849
They're not going to put

18:18.097 --> 18:19.849
our family on their homepage.

18:19.891 --> 18:22.226
Not a chance.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.020
I thought bras were stronger.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.105
(laughs)

18:26.146 --> 18:27.398
(phone alarm beeping)

18:27.440 --> 18:29.650
Yes. That's it. 24 hours is up.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.650
Can I go now?

18:29.692 --> 18:30.359
Go.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.030
Wait, take Jasper...

18:34.655 --> 18:35.865
With you.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.954
(Henry screaming)

18:42.204 --> 18:42.789
(thud)

18:42.830 --> 18:43.831
(elevator dings)

18:46.000 --> 18:48.502
I'm back!

18:46.000 --> 18:48.502
I'm not grounded anymore!

18:48.878 --> 18:49.796
Hello, Henry.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.131
Where's Ray?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.052
He went to capture

18:53.466 --> 18:56.052
a bad pig farmer with Charlotte.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.846
Oh, I knew it.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.432
Dang daggit!

19:03.977 --> 19:05.519
Do you know when

19:03.977 --> 19:05.519
they're going to be back?

19:05.561 --> 19:06.938
Yeah, any minute.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.482
Why'd you put down a tarp?

19:09.983 --> 19:11.025
Ray called me.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.234
He said he's on his way back,

19:12.276 --> 19:14.194
and he told me

19:12.276 --> 19:14.194
to put down a tarp.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.947
Apparently this is

19:14.236 --> 19:15.947
all I'm good for.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.074
(beeping)

19:21.285 --> 19:22.244
Henry!

19:22.286 --> 19:23.162
You're back!

19:23.496 --> 19:25.289
Where's your new sidekick?

19:25.706 --> 19:26.540
Oh, you mean Charlotte?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.127
She'll be down in a sec.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.419
She was amazing today.

19:30.461 --> 19:31.796
Ooh, I bet.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.090
So get this,

19:34.132 --> 19:35.675
we're trying to capture

19:34.132 --> 19:35.675
this illegal pig farmer,

19:35.716 --> 19:38.552
but he sees us coming

19:35.716 --> 19:38.552
so he takes off running.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.805
I was going to zap him,

19:38.886 --> 19:40.805
but I was worried I might hit

19:40.847 --> 19:41.764
one of the pigs by mistake.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.893
Yeah, we don't want

19:43.141 --> 19:45.893
anything bad to happen to a pig.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.353
(laughs)

19:47.394 --> 19:49.438
So, Charlotte,

19:47.394 --> 19:49.438
she jumps on the big pig

19:49.480 --> 19:51.357
and starts riding

19:49.480 --> 19:51.357
after the farmer.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.985
Then she catches up to him,

19:54.027 --> 19:55.444
then she jumps off

19:54.027 --> 19:55.444
and tackles the guy

19:55.486 --> 19:56.696
right in the middle

19:55.486 --> 19:56.696
of a pig pen.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.114
(beeping)

20:02.994 --> 20:04.037
(All)

20:02.994 --> 20:04.037
Ooh.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.374
And that's why

20:06.998 --> 20:08.374
we needed the tarp.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.090
Here's a tissue.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.260
That's not helping!

20:21.179 --> 20:24.015
Ooh, why are you so mad?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.308
It's just a little pig slop.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.685
(chuckling)

20:27.727 --> 20:29.478
I'm not mad about the pig slop.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.690
I'm mad because a friend of mine

20:29.520 --> 20:32.690
called me a job stealer,

20:32.732 --> 20:35.317
and he said I couldn't be

20:32.732 --> 20:35.317
a sidekick because I'm a girl.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.570
- I changed it

20:35.902 --> 20:37.570
to young woman.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.570
- Same thing.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.863
(laughs)

20:40.156 --> 20:41.991
Charlotte was not trying

20:40.156 --> 20:41.991
to steal your job.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.450
I was.

20:43.826 --> 20:44.744
He was.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.330
Well... I guess...

20:48.915 --> 20:51.084
Since you rode a large pig

20:52.126 --> 20:53.335
and tackled a farmer...

20:56.005 --> 20:57.256
I guess you can do my job.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.926
Thanks.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.385
But I don't want to do your job.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.429
You don't?

21:03.470 --> 21:04.805
No.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.891
I don't want to be

21:04.847 --> 21:06.891
running after bad guys

21:06.933 --> 21:10.228
and evil criminals, fighting,

21:06.933 --> 21:10.228
and getting all disgusting.

21:11.062 --> 21:11.854
I'll do it.

21:11.896 --> 21:12.688
Schwoz!

21:14.398 --> 21:16.025
Am I going to have

21:14.398 --> 21:16.025
to turn you over my knee?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.027
No. No spanky.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.238
(laughs)

21:21.030 --> 21:22.990
So... Forgive me?

21:24.158 --> 21:25.201
I will...

21:25.952 --> 21:27.120
After we hug.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.455
Oh, no, no, no.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.455
Please don't.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.498
(Charlotte)

21:29.496 --> 21:31.498
Yeah, that's my baby.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.459
That's nice.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.130
I'll be in the shower.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.138
I'm just texting.

21:45.763 --> 21:46.555
(snaps picture)

21:46.847 --> 21:47.681
Please spank him.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.016
Come here, Schwoz.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.978
No, no, no.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.978
No, no. Oh.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.191
(Schwoz)

21:55.815 --> 21:57.191
No, no, no!

22:05.283 --> 22:09.954
(music)

22:28.222 --> 22:29.182
(oven bell)

22:29.223 --> 22:30.390
Mmm...
