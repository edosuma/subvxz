00:15.885 --> 00:20.237
You do realize I rely on you for
critical information like this?

00:20.281 --> 00:22.892
And it's a lot of pressure,
Frank, year after year.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.459
Don't look at me, boss.

00:24.502 --> 00:27.027
This kind of intel
ain't my forte.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.203
What is your forte, Sid?

00:29.246 --> 00:31.031
Not birthday presents.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.858
Just ask Sheila.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.472
Abigail.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.173
Another spa day is fine.

00:46.350 --> 00:49.136
Sir, you sure
you really want to do this?

00:49.179 --> 00:51.094
Do what?

00:51.138 --> 00:54.358
Former Detective
Douglas McKenzie is here.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.231
What?

00:58.493 --> 01:00.756
He reached out. I asked him up.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.628
Why?

01:04.629 --> 01:06.849
Respect for his service.

01:06.892 --> 01:09.852
Yeah, but McKenzie?

01:09.895 --> 01:12.028
The harder it is
to show respect,

01:12.072 --> 01:14.204
the harder
you have to work at it.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.470
In the public eye,
he's a racist cop.

01:19.514 --> 01:22.386
That's about a dozen words,
and it's full of crap.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.345
You know it, and I know it.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.738
That judge should be impeached.Doesn't matter.

01:26.782 --> 01:28.523
The public eye won't blink.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.612
Let's have him.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.624
Mr. Reagan.

01:44.843 --> 01:47.063
Mr. McKenzie.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.065
You may remember

01:49.109 --> 01:52.721
Lieutenant Gormley,
my DCPI Garrett Moore.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.332
They will be staying.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.903
Have a seat.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.611
Here's what you know.

02:13.655 --> 02:16.005
There have been
numerous robberies lately

02:16.048 --> 02:17.833
that target jewelry
and watch boutiques

02:17.876 --> 02:19.617
adjacent to protest routes.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.532
And what we don't know.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.012
They're working
the public assumption

02:23.055 --> 02:24.709
that it's just looting
by the marchers.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.581
Which sometimes it is.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.713
But you're saying
sometimes it's not.

02:28.757 --> 02:31.238
I have a theory I can back up.

02:31.281 --> 02:32.761
Well, have at it.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.589
After I left the job,
I took over

02:34.632 --> 02:36.373
my dad's pawnshop in Queens.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.375
A guy's been coming in
the past couple months,

02:38.419 --> 02:40.290
fencing Rolexes

02:40.334 --> 02:42.205
and Omegas and such.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.294
I've gained his confidence,

02:44.338 --> 02:46.383
promised I'd move
whatever he's got.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.863
And I got his digits

02:47.906 --> 02:49.560
and his face
on the security cams.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.955
And this ties to marches how?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.913
He comes in with the goods
the day after.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.176
Like clockwork.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.917
Parades and protests
in all five boroughs.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.790
This guy and his crew
work these stores

03:01.833 --> 03:03.661
like farmhands
in harvest season.

03:05.881 --> 03:09.363
One PP's a couple of trains
from Queens.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.582
Meaning?

03:11.626 --> 03:14.237
You could've gone
to any precinct there.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.674
Your old C.O. in the 2-1.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.199
You're always telling the troops
you're still one of them.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.072
Maybe you want to prove it.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.640
Stop shuffling papers,
solve an actual case.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.819
You act like
I owe you something.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.038
You act like you don't.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.482
You know what?
Don't even worry about it.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.266
Dude, I spilled coffee
on my training officer

03:43.310 --> 03:44.659
our very first tour.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.269
He was pissed.

03:46.313 --> 03:49.185
So just apologize and offer
to pay for his dry cleaning.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.926
And by the way,
it's "boss" or "Sarge"

03:50.969 --> 03:52.275
but never "dude."

03:52.319 --> 03:54.408
Sorry,Reagan.

03:54.451 --> 03:57.019
Lady at the desk for you.She got a name, Wolinski?

03:57.062 --> 03:58.542
Probably, but right now
she's demanding

03:58.586 --> 04:00.109
to see her baby's daddy.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.851
And she's talking about me?

04:02.894 --> 04:04.896
She said "Jamison Reagan."

04:12.513 --> 04:13.992
Got ya!

04:14.036 --> 04:15.559
Alison.

04:15.603 --> 04:16.647
Jamie!

04:17.909 --> 04:19.650
Hey. Not funny.

04:19.694 --> 04:21.870
What?"Baby's daddy"?

04:21.913 --> 04:23.654
Oh, come on, it's me.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.787
Yep, it's you.

04:25.830 --> 04:28.355
Um, so...

04:28.398 --> 04:29.486
what's it been?

04:29.530 --> 04:30.966
Uh, the five-year reunion.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.924
You had just started law school.

04:32.968 --> 04:34.317
Yeah, and you brought
a boyfriend

04:34.361 --> 04:36.406
who got super tanked--
it was Don, Dean...

04:36.450 --> 04:37.886
Well, it lasted a week.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.236
So, what brings you here?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.368
Is something wrong?

04:41.411 --> 04:43.457
Yeah. Six women murdered
and mutilated

04:43.500 --> 04:45.067
around Beak Street
over six years,

04:45.110 --> 04:46.808
and not a single arrest.

04:46.851 --> 04:47.852
A cold case?

04:47.896 --> 04:49.637
Not anymore.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.421
And guess who solved it.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.823
Morning, Sal.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.390
Danny.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.174
Don't we have kids
who should be doing this?

05:05.217 --> 05:06.915
You'd think.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.701
Wow.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.715
Sal!

05:29.416 --> 05:30.591
Hey.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.116
Dad.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.291
Dad!

05:35.335 --> 05:36.423
Dad.

05:36.466 --> 05:37.772
Hey, hey. Call 911.

05:38.773 --> 05:39.904
Hang on, Sal.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.863
[groaning]Look at me.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.343
You got to hang on, Sal.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.692
Okay? Come on.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.346
Hurry up, kid.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.687
You okay, Scott?

06:23.731 --> 06:25.210
Uh, my dad's gonna live, right?

06:25.254 --> 06:27.865
Well, the doctors waiting
on him are top-notch, so...

06:27.909 --> 06:31.260
Look, you know of any bad
blood in the neighborhood?

06:31.303 --> 06:32.566
No.

06:32.609 --> 06:33.915
Anything strange happening
here at the house?

06:33.958 --> 06:35.482
Vandalism? Weird calls?

06:37.048 --> 06:38.310
Okay.

06:38.354 --> 06:39.616
Why didn't you shoot at the car?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.576
'Cause it's a Lamborghini?

06:42.619 --> 06:44.839
I was taking out the trash.
I'm in my pajamas.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.188
I don't have my gun on me.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.885
But you saw the driver, right?

06:47.929 --> 06:49.017
I didn't see the driver.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.148
The windows are tinted.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.236
Well, the license plate?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.935
The cops always getthe license plate.

06:53.978 --> 06:56.372
Look, the guy sped away
really fast.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.243
Okay, and I had to take care
of your dad.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.984
Just, it all happened
really fast.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.769
What do you mean,
"it all happened really fast"?

07:01.812 --> 07:03.466
That's-that's all you got?

07:03.510 --> 07:04.554
Seriously?

07:04.598 --> 07:05.816
That's my dad in there.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.123
I know it's your Dad,
Scott, okay?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.385
And I'll get the guy who did it.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.865
You better nail the guy.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.475
I will. Hey.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.650
He's the vic's son.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.260
Can you take him
to the hospital, please?

07:16.610 --> 07:19.439
I'll get him.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.621
Yeah, boss.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.061
And you run all this?

07:33.104 --> 07:34.279
Uh, no.

07:34.323 --> 07:35.890
I'm just a sergeant.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.240
You were always
so incredibly modest.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.589
And now in this uniform.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.243
Ooh.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.462
Please tell me you're single.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.941
Oh, my God.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.161
I hate her already.
What is her name?

07:46.204 --> 07:47.771
Where did you meet?
Tell me ev...

07:47.815 --> 07:49.817
Alison, you came to talk
about the Beak Street Butcher.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.732
Okay.

07:51.775 --> 07:55.562
So, I do a podcast, <i>
Murder in Manhattan.</i>

07:55.605 --> 07:59.043
I'll send you the link.
I have 10,000 followers.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.089
Anyways, I've
become obsessed

08:01.132 --> 08:02.656
with these six women.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.179
I went to the scene
of the crime,

08:04.222 --> 08:05.572
I interviewed people
who knew 'em...

08:05.615 --> 08:07.269
So did the NYPD.
It went nowhere.

08:07.312 --> 08:08.444
Because the original detective
passed away

08:08.488 --> 08:09.532
a couple years ago.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.620
Case died with him.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.014
I'm sure someone picked it up.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.581
Well, whoever they are,
they obviously don't care,

08:14.624 --> 08:16.234
because they don't answer
my calls anymore,

08:16.278 --> 08:19.063
even though I told 'em
his name is Boris Vache.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.935
You found the murderer?

08:20.978 --> 08:22.763
I mapped out where
all the murders occurred,

08:22.806 --> 08:25.374
and Vache lives smack dab
in the center of 'em.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.550
And he fits a
witness description.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.247
And he's a total creeper.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.206
And he screamed out his window
at me when I went and knocked.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.947
You went and harassed him?

08:32.990 --> 08:35.297
He's got to know
someone's onto him.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.038
Okay, what can I do for you?

08:37.081 --> 08:39.040
You want me to call
the detective on the case?

08:39.083 --> 08:40.607
No. We're past that.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.782
I need Erin.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.567
She's the D.A.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.438
She's a bureau chief.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.092
And she's always been
hella smart,

08:48.136 --> 08:50.660
and when she sees my proof,
she's gonna charge the guy.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.488
Let's just see
this proof of yours.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.540
Get looking, buster.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.371
What do you mean,
I can't work the case, boss?

09:06.415 --> 09:08.809
You work cases in the 5-4,not Staten Island.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.550
No, but it happened
right outside my door.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.116
I practically saw
the whole thing.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.683
So that makes youan eyewitness.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.685
Boss, it sounds like
the guy did get shot

09:15.729 --> 09:17.731
about ten feet in front
of Reagan's front door.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.298
Yeah, but we already havesomebody working on the case.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.605
Matter of fact, here comes
the lead detective now.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.520
Mike. Been a long time.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.913
Too long.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.176
Reagan, Baez,

09:28.219 --> 09:30.004
Detective Judy Farrow.Nice to meet you.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.527
Hello.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.007
Can we find a cup of coffee

09:33.050 --> 09:34.574
and somewhere quiet to talk?

09:34.617 --> 09:36.924
Sure.Alone?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.720
And?

09:50.764 --> 09:52.853
He downloaded me on
what he's gathered.

09:52.896 --> 09:56.421
Handed over the guy's I.D.,
footage from the store,

09:56.465 --> 09:58.598
even made contemporaneous notes
of their conversations.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.991
McKenzie always
had chops.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.297
That what made you give him
another at-bat?

10:02.340 --> 10:04.865
Matter of conscience.

10:04.908 --> 10:08.346
Not to mention we are losing
a whole lot of good cops.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.827
If this isabout McKenzie, hold up.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.176
Why?

10:12.220 --> 10:14.048
He delivered the goods.Word is,

10:14.091 --> 10:16.224
he trashes this department
and its commissioner

10:16.267 --> 10:18.008
every chance he gets.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.923
And if he doesn't get
a chance, he makes one.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.055
What does that mean?

10:21.098 --> 10:22.404
It means he's been kicked out

10:22.447 --> 10:23.492
of retirement rackets

10:23.535 --> 10:24.754
and RDNY meetings

10:24.798 --> 10:27.365
for standing on a soapbox
and throwing shade.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.628
Which is his right.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.369
You covering for him?

10:31.413 --> 10:34.068
I am keeping an open mind.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.897
I did have a hand in his exit.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.508
And having a beef
doesn't make his intel bad.

10:39.551 --> 10:42.511
Unless it's a setup. Say, to
send you on a wild-goose chase

10:42.554 --> 10:43.773
or get you to arrest people

10:43.817 --> 10:45.949
who really are just
peaceful protestors.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.777
How about you let me
run down his leads

10:47.821 --> 10:49.736
before you pass
judgment, Garrett?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.302
How about you just let me
keep us

10:51.346 --> 10:53.565
from getting a black eye
from the media?

10:54.566 --> 10:56.133
Boss?

10:59.223 --> 11:01.008
You'll know when I know.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.537
So, to recap, it was a
late-model Lamborghini Huracán

11:08.580 --> 11:12.628
traveling east to west at
approximately 0745 hours.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.717
Not "late-model," around 2018,

11:14.761 --> 11:16.153
and it was the coupe,
not the Spyder.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.720
You know cars.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.330
Uh, I'm observant.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.158
And as it fled the scene,
did you observe

11:21.202 --> 11:23.117
which way it turned
at the end of your street?

11:23.160 --> 11:25.815
Well, I was tending to Sal,
but right, I think.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.165
Don't write down
that I said "I think."

11:28.209 --> 11:29.471
You said it.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.475
Finding this car is important.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.607
Finding this car is
the easiest piece of the puzzle.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.218
Why don't you ask me
the shooter's motive?

11:37.261 --> 11:38.436
Why would you know that?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.308
Because maybe I have a theory.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.788
"Maybe" means you don't.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.137
Well, do you have one?

11:43.180 --> 11:45.748
Do you divulge your thinking
on cases to witnesses?

11:48.272 --> 11:49.796
How long you had
that gold shield?

11:49.839 --> 11:51.841
I'm asking the questions.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.364
Hmm.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.628
Look, I know
you're frustrated.I'm frustrated

11:56.672 --> 11:58.935
because we're wasting
valuable resources.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.067
How's that?

12:00.110 --> 12:01.764
I should be working the case.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.332
You are. As an eyewitness.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.334
Not what I mean.I know what you meant.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.125
It's all in there.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.823
I, uh, color-coded each murder

12:16.866 --> 12:18.520
for easier reading.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.174
Plus, it makes it more fun.

12:20.217 --> 12:22.002
And you've gone
through all this?

12:22.045 --> 12:24.221
She makes some
very interesting points.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.746
I just want justice for the
six women Boris Vache killed.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.357
Well, we will take this
under advisement.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.055
You're not gonna read it?

12:32.099 --> 12:33.361
Uh...

12:33.404 --> 12:35.058
that's my job.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.712
So you're just blowing me off?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.148
I didn't say that.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.367
Well, you kind of did.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.717
I said I would
take a look at it.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.414
But you need to understand
that we get a lot

12:43.458 --> 12:47.679
of so-called proof these days
from citizen investigators.

12:47.723 --> 12:48.942
You mean kooks.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.073
She doesn't mean kooks.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.248
Yeah, I meant kooks.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.859
I'm not saying
you are one.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.469
I'm just saying, with
all these podcasts

12:54.512 --> 12:56.645
and, uh, true crime stuff
on Netflix,

12:56.688 --> 12:59.256
everyone seems to think
they're Sam Spade.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.867
A-And, kid,
just so you know,

13:00.910 --> 13:02.433
Sam Spade was
a fictional character...

13:02.477 --> 13:03.783
Created by Dashiell Hammett

13:03.826 --> 13:06.133
in the 1930s novel <i>
The Maltese Falcon,</i>

13:06.176 --> 13:07.830
who then appeared

13:07.874 --> 13:10.790
in four subsequent short stories
and six film adaptations.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.400
Well, that's, uh,

13:12.443 --> 13:14.184
Alison's
kind of a brainiac.

13:14.228 --> 13:17.100
She used to save my butt with
the school paper all the time.

13:17.144 --> 13:19.102
Well, then maybe

13:19.146 --> 13:22.149
you should, uh, pay her back by
helping me look over her case.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.412
Jamie, would you?Oh.

13:24.455 --> 13:25.848
W-Well...

13:25.892 --> 13:27.981
I mean, I-I got the--
I got the day job.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.983
And, um, I would have to ask

13:30.026 --> 13:32.028
permission from my C.O., so...

13:32.072 --> 13:36.641
Who I'm sure would sign off
if I made an official request.

13:36.685 --> 13:37.860
Eh, come on, pal.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.209
What do you say?

13:39.253 --> 13:40.907
This could be great.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.560
It's great. Yeah.

13:42.604 --> 13:43.605
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.482
See? This guy's a weirdo.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.876
And Alison found public records
he did eight months in 2009.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.095
For what?

13:55.138 --> 13:56.096
Falsifying
business records.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.619
He's an insurance agent.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.056
Not exactly Ted Bundy.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.711
So you're skeptical?

14:02.754 --> 14:04.017
Your friend seems nice and all.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.149
But, last night,
I called the current detective

14:06.193 --> 14:08.586
working on the case,
who looked over the old notes.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.067
Said Boris Vache
was crossed off early.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.503
Did it say why?

14:12.547 --> 14:14.984
Nope. Just a line
through his name.

14:15.028 --> 14:17.682
Well, we could still go pay
Vache a visit, right?

14:17.726 --> 14:19.946
And Alison'll love you
even more.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.512
Excuse me?

14:21.556 --> 14:23.950
Come on. Didn't you see the eyes
she's making at you?

14:23.993 --> 14:26.909
Vache ain't the only
guy she's fixated on.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.215
You're nuts.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.086
And you're not half as cute
as another Reagan

14:30.130 --> 14:31.305
I sometimes team up with,

14:31.348 --> 14:33.046
so we're stuck
with each other.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.222
Let's get to work.

14:38.529 --> 14:41.228
So you need anything
from home?

14:41.271 --> 14:42.838
Sneak in a beer for me?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.146
Not unless he
brings me one, too.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.191
Danny. Come in.

14:49.453 --> 14:50.759
How you doing, Sal?

14:50.802 --> 14:52.152
Alive.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.545
Thanks to you.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.939
That's what neighbors are for,
right?

14:56.983 --> 14:57.809
Except for when
they lie to you.

14:57.853 --> 14:58.810
Scott.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.290
Dad,

15:00.334 --> 15:01.944
he said he would find out
who did this

15:01.988 --> 15:05.513
and then passed it off to the
lady who showed up last night.

15:05.556 --> 15:08.385
Scott, I didn't pass it off
to anyone.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.430
As a matter of fact,
I spent the night

15:09.473 --> 15:10.953
looking into Lamborghini owners

15:10.997 --> 15:12.259
in the tristate area.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.478
Well... well,
did you find the guy?

15:14.522 --> 15:16.437
I didn't. Unfortunately.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.873
But I thought it might help

15:17.917 --> 15:19.701
if I could ask your dad
a few more questions.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.485
Maybe he might
remember something.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.140
Not much. I...

15:24.184 --> 15:27.056
I was taking out the trash.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.840
I saw that car.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.625
And then...

15:31.887 --> 15:33.454
It-it was like...

15:33.497 --> 15:37.110
someone hit me
with a wrecking ball.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.112
I know you don't remember much

15:39.155 --> 15:40.548
about then or the
driver or anything,

15:40.591 --> 15:42.506
but y-your hardware store...

15:42.550 --> 15:43.943
What about it?Do you have a beef

15:43.986 --> 15:45.466
with anyone?

15:45.509 --> 15:46.902
Do you owe any outstanding
debts with anyone

15:46.946 --> 15:48.643
that could've led
to this happening?

15:48.686 --> 15:50.732
Grievances with customers?
Anything that could've...

15:50.775 --> 15:52.081
Don't answer that,
Mr. Marino.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.082
What...

15:54.127 --> 15:55.258
Visiting my neighbor.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.346
Well, he's actually

15:56.390 --> 15:58.000
grilling his neighbor,

15:58.044 --> 15:59.915
as if my dad
did something wrong.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.221
You need to leave now,

16:01.264 --> 16:02.918
Detective Reagan.
Thank you.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.920
You never heard the saying
"two heads are better than one"?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.487
You never heard the saying
"I'm about two seconds

16:06.530 --> 16:08.793
"from making a complaint
against you for interfering

16:08.837 --> 16:10.099
in an ongoing investigation"?

16:10.143 --> 16:11.187
Folks,

16:11.231 --> 16:12.275
can you keep it down?

16:12.319 --> 16:14.060
You really should keep it down

16:14.103 --> 16:15.191
while he's trying
to rest.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.237
Sal, feel better. Scott.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.021
See you, Mr. Reagan.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.285
I'm sorry about that.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.780
What do you want?

16:38.823 --> 16:40.260
A word.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.916
Further than Alison got.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.008
Yeah?

16:50.574 --> 16:52.620
You asking a question or not?

16:52.663 --> 16:54.317
Sir, how long you been
in that chair?

16:54.361 --> 16:56.232
Eight years.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.494
Car accident.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.497
Murders started six years ago.

17:00.541 --> 17:01.933
Explains why he's off the list.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.981
She sent you, didn't she?She who?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.548
My stalker.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.115
Alison Gable.

17:09.158 --> 17:10.855
How do you know her name?When I wouldn't talk
to her,

17:10.899 --> 17:13.510
she stuck her card
in my mailbox.

17:13.554 --> 17:15.034
She yelled out
that if I was innocent

17:15.077 --> 17:18.341
I should come on her show
and clear my name.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.215
Can you believe it?

17:22.258 --> 17:23.999
I'm stuck in this chair
for life,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.958
and she's out there telling the
world that I killed those girls.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.136
We'll get her to stop.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.659
Thanks for your time, Mr. Vache.

17:31.702 --> 17:32.486
Good day.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.709
For the last time,

17:38.753 --> 17:41.843
Farrow is the lead
detective on this case.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.062
Okay.

17:44.628 --> 17:48.023
Why am I not surprised
Farrow ratted on me?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.894
With good reason.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.113
What good reason?

17:51.157 --> 17:52.375
Where do you want me to start?

17:52.419 --> 17:54.116
How 'bout with one good reason?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.161
It's her case.

17:55.204 --> 17:57.119
That's... red tape.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.947
No, it's a fact.

17:58.990 --> 18:02.690
No, the fact
is that it's a mistake.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.084
Which is just how you look at
everything you don't agree with.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.302
That is not true.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.087
You want an example?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.306
I-I don't agree with you
right now,

18:10.350 --> 18:11.742
but you're not a mistake.

18:11.786 --> 18:12.743
See?

18:12.787 --> 18:14.919
You catch more bees with honey

18:14.963 --> 18:18.358
than with... bigfooting
around their territory.

18:18.401 --> 18:19.881
You mean "than with vinegar."

18:22.101 --> 18:24.146
You know,

18:24.190 --> 18:26.757
when I first started
working with you,

18:26.801 --> 18:30.109
I was struck by how many
tools you had on your belt.

18:30.152 --> 18:33.155
Instinct, sure.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.375
But also compassion

18:35.418 --> 18:37.464
and humor and charm

18:37.507 --> 18:39.292
and empathy.

18:40.597 --> 18:43.122
'Kay, well, don't I still have
all those wonderful things?

18:43.165 --> 18:44.297
Yeah.Mm.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.298
I know you do.Thank you.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.126
They're a little hard to see

18:47.169 --> 18:50.303
when you're up there driving
around in your steamroller.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.439
What?

18:59.660 --> 19:01.357
You stopped responding.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.187
I don't know what else to say.

19:19.288 --> 19:20.594
Hey, babe.Hey.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.204
Everything okay?

19:22.248 --> 19:24.424
Just surprised we have a guest.

19:25.903 --> 19:27.818
Honey, I'm home!Oh! Oh.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.256
What are you doing here?

19:30.299 --> 19:31.909
I just popped by

19:31.953 --> 19:33.476
to chat up the missus.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.044
Yeah. Alison has been telling me
about you in high school

19:36.087 --> 19:37.437
and your
mullet phase.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.134
It was one bad haircut.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.744
Oh, no. No.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.311
You rocked that Camaro cut

19:42.355 --> 19:43.878
all semester.Mm.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.271
ALISON:One inch longer
in the back,

19:45.314 --> 19:46.489
and it would've been
a Kentucky waterfall.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.099
Oh.I have photos.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.927
I'm gonna need those
for the divorce.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.407
Okay.

19:51.451 --> 19:54.758
Um, how did you know
where I live?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.151
Have you not realized

19:56.195 --> 19:58.414
my overwhelming powers
of deduction yet?

19:58.458 --> 19:59.981
Yeah.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.504
What's your hurry?

20:01.548 --> 20:03.027
Well, um...
it's date night.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.333
It's date night.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.334
JAMIE:So...Oh, okay.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.335
Yeah.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.902
All right.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.904
So, um, how's it going
with you and Anthony?

20:09.947 --> 20:12.211
Um, still-- I'm still putting it
all together.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.300
But you're gonna arrest
Vache, right?

20:14.343 --> 20:16.345
Whatever happens,
you'll be the first to know.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.433
Okay. Mm-hmm.All right?

20:17.477 --> 20:18.695
Okay.'Kay.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.655
So amazing
to meet you, girl. Hugs.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.352
Mwah. Mwah.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.224
You.Okay. Later, gators.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.400
Okay. All right. Bye.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.010
Okay. All right.Okay.
Bye.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.185
Bye!

20:32.013 --> 20:34.755
It's funny
you never mentioned her, honey.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.496
Now you know why.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.330
Again?

20:44.373 --> 20:45.374
Really?

20:45.418 --> 20:46.984
Not here to butt in.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.422
Just came to apologize.

20:49.465 --> 20:52.294
Apparently, steamrolling
people is my M.O.,

20:52.338 --> 20:54.253
so I owe you an apology.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.300
That's it?

20:58.344 --> 20:59.997
Nothing else?

21:00.041 --> 21:02.217
Not a, uh, "Yeah,
you were a dick,

21:02.261 --> 21:03.479
but I accept
your apology"?

21:03.523 --> 21:04.959
Still waiting
for the other shoe.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.352
There's no other shoe.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.615
Word is there's always
another shoe with you.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.094
Not this time.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.922
Just an apology.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.924
Good night.

21:13.968 --> 21:16.492
There's a reason neither of us
could find the owner

21:16.536 --> 21:17.711
of that Lamborghini.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.321
Which is?

21:19.365 --> 21:20.844
It was rented

21:20.888 --> 21:23.673
from a lifestyle time-share firm
out of Maryland.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.067
A lifestyle what?Apparently,

21:26.110 --> 21:28.243
luxury brands rent
cars, watches, boats.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.462
Whatever you need

21:29.505 --> 21:30.811
to keep up with the Joneses.

21:30.854 --> 21:32.769
Or to shoot Sal Marino.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.641
Just ask Joel Ross.Talking about

21:34.684 --> 21:36.730
Joel Ross, my neighbor
from a few blocks away?

21:36.773 --> 21:38.340
His name is on the Lambo lease.

21:38.384 --> 21:41.648
Huh, he always struck me
as a Volvo wagon kind of a guy.

21:41.691 --> 21:44.564
No priors,
no history of violence,

21:44.607 --> 21:46.870
and when I got him
on his cell in Miami,

21:46.914 --> 21:49.264
he swears he's been there
all week on business.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.744
But you're not buying it?

21:50.787 --> 21:52.702
Flight he booked left
two hours after the shooting.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.095
He could've driven straight
from your street to LaGuardia

21:54.138 --> 21:55.401
and made it, no sweat.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.446
Mm, that's a theory.

21:57.490 --> 22:01.015
Uh, it's your case,
so good luck.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.886
He's offered to come back

22:02.930 --> 22:04.888
and answer questions.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.281
Want to join?

22:06.325 --> 22:09.371
You want me to join you
on the case?

22:09.415 --> 22:11.678
Familiar face
might put him at ease

22:11.721 --> 22:13.201
or keep him off guard.

22:13.244 --> 22:16.073
Sounds like a lot of fun,
but my boss would kill me, so...

22:16.117 --> 22:17.988
Didn't blink when I called him.

22:18.032 --> 22:20.077
You spoke to Lieutenant Gee
about this already?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.690
Try to keep up, Reagan.

22:25.561 --> 22:26.736
Huh.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.838
Sorry, we're closed.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.151
What are you doing here?

22:50.194 --> 22:52.936
Well...

22:52.980 --> 22:56.636
Somebody demanded I work a case.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.944
Yeah, but if my mark comes in
and sees me talking to the PC...

23:00.988 --> 23:04.121
Calculated risk, but...

23:04.165 --> 23:07.298
your reaction says
you're telling the truth.

23:07.342 --> 23:08.474
Thought I was lying?

23:08.517 --> 23:10.737
Trust but verify.

23:10.780 --> 23:13.566
The leads
that you gave Lieutenant Gormley

23:13.609 --> 23:15.002
did not pan out.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.308
Guy used fake I.D.,

23:17.352 --> 23:20.094
and he hid his face

23:20.137 --> 23:22.618
from, uh, your cameras here.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.273
I told you, these guys are pros.

23:25.316 --> 23:28.755
Or they were part of a setup.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.583
Why would they set me up?

23:30.626 --> 23:33.412
Not their setup.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.414
Yours.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.807
I risk my neck

23:37.851 --> 23:39.809
to get information
on an organized crime ring,

23:39.853 --> 23:41.681
and you think
that I'm duping you?

23:41.724 --> 23:45.075
Well, I do know you still choose
to vent about me

23:45.119 --> 23:47.382
to anyone who cares to listen.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.079
Yeah,
I-I got a right to be angry.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.343
Yeah, you do.

23:52.387 --> 23:55.695
But what I brought you is real.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.697
And your only motive

23:57.740 --> 24:00.351
is concern for public safety?

24:00.395 --> 24:03.006
You know what?

24:03.050 --> 24:06.401
I would say shame on you,
but it's really shame on me,

24:06.445 --> 24:09.970
because this is the second time
that you played me for a fool.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.928
Get out of my shop.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.111
I'm not your enemy.

24:21.155 --> 24:23.200
Never was.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.432
Come on!

24:37.476 --> 24:37.998
I like it.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.521
Come on. Fine.

24:39.565 --> 24:40.609
Who's next?
Okay, I'll go.

24:40.653 --> 24:41.828
Something that's
highly overrated?

24:41.871 --> 24:43.307
True crime podcasts.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.048
Okay. Overrated how?

24:45.092 --> 24:47.398
Yeah, how? <i>Serial.</i>

24:47.442 --> 24:50.489
I mean,
season one was fantastic.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.186
Check out Gramps keeping up
with the young folk.

24:52.229 --> 24:53.579
JAMIE:Yeah.Okay. How?

24:53.622 --> 24:55.102
In that it turns
a whole lot of people

24:55.145 --> 24:57.017
into sloppy,
amateur detectives.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.279
What's a whole lot?

24:58.322 --> 25:00.281
One.More than one.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.762
No, he had a friend from
high school, Alison.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.895
Brought him a cold case.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.723
I don't think you
can blame Alison

25:07.767 --> 25:09.725
on a podcast.
That's more like

25:09.769 --> 25:11.988
misplaced self-confidence.

25:12.032 --> 25:14.730
Sounds like you don't like
the ripple effect of the thing

25:14.774 --> 25:16.776
as much as you don't like
the thing itself.

25:16.819 --> 25:19.039
No. If you did a great
podcast about surgeons,

25:19.082 --> 25:20.562
a whole lot of people
would be running around

25:20.606 --> 25:21.694
trying to do
medical procedures.

25:21.737 --> 25:22.999
He's got a point.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.088
All right.
Judge, what say you?

25:27.787 --> 25:29.745
Okay.

25:29.789 --> 25:32.966
I'll tell you something
that's definitely overrated.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.141
Taking your own advice.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.143
Mm.

25:36.186 --> 25:37.710
No.Come on, now. Hear me out.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.929
Advice-- good advice, anyway--

25:39.973 --> 25:42.366
is tailored to the one
you're offering it to.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.846
I don't know.So,

25:43.890 --> 25:45.195
if I ever give you advice...

25:45.239 --> 25:47.633
"If"? "Ever"?
Are you kidding me?

25:47.676 --> 25:52.072
[all laugh]Okay. Or Danny
or Jamie or anybody,

25:52.115 --> 25:55.641
it's custom-built
for each individual.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.947
So, I know what
they're gonna

25:57.991 --> 26:00.210
listen to
and what they won't listen to.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.299
So, taking my own advice?

26:02.343 --> 26:04.345
It wouldn't fit.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.955
I don't know.

26:05.999 --> 26:09.045
I think that sounds more like
"name a loophole" to me.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.481
Judge,

26:10.525 --> 26:11.570
what say you?

26:11.613 --> 26:13.049
I'm not judging the PC.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.573
Come on.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.183
You named the game.
You got to decide.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.227
Go.Yeah.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.148
The umpire needs glasses.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.889
All right, who's next?

26:26.933 --> 26:29.370
I've got one that's bulletproof.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.328
The wisdom that comes

26:31.372 --> 26:32.634
with age.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.636
Boy, is that overrated.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.464
Wait,

26:36.507 --> 26:37.987
I was really looking
forward to that.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.423
Yeah, how's that, Pop?

26:39.467 --> 26:41.425
When you look
back, it becomes

26:41.469 --> 26:45.299
about all the dumb decisions
that you made.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.867
All the people that you hurt

26:47.910 --> 26:50.434
before you got the wisdom.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.480
So,

26:52.523 --> 26:55.570
wise up now.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.267
Eh...

26:57.311 --> 26:59.313
What say you?

26:59.356 --> 27:01.010
I think...

27:01.054 --> 27:02.882
that we've got a winner!

27:05.711 --> 27:07.190
Nice going, Pop.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.802
Winner winner chicken dinner.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.634
Dawn.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.418
That's Detective
Judy Farrow.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.767
Ms. Ross.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.639
Where's your husband?

27:25.861 --> 27:28.211
So, uh, where's Joel?

27:28.255 --> 27:29.691
Joel didn't get off the plane.

27:29.735 --> 27:30.779
Come again?

27:30.823 --> 27:32.085
I waited at
LaGuardia for hours.

27:32.128 --> 27:33.695
Turns out he didn't check in

27:33.739 --> 27:35.610
at the gate in Miami,
and now he's not

27:35.654 --> 27:37.046
answering the phone.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.874
Sounds like your husband
has a guilty conscience.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.876
He has nothing
to feel guilty about.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.791
You did hear that Sal Marino
was shot, right, Dawn?

27:42.835 --> 27:44.010
Who hasn't?

27:44.053 --> 27:46.099
Well, I saw Joel's new car

27:46.142 --> 27:47.796
at the scene,
which is strange,

27:47.840 --> 27:49.537
'cause who knew he even had one?

27:49.580 --> 27:51.495
What does that mean?

27:51.539 --> 27:53.497
You want to explain
how he went from a Volvo

27:53.541 --> 27:54.716
to a Lambo in no time flat?

27:54.760 --> 27:56.718
Anything he did
is not his fault.

27:56.762 --> 27:57.806
Then whose is it?

27:59.068 --> 28:00.809
Can I...

28:00.853 --> 28:02.768
Can I offer either one of you
a drink? Danny,

28:02.811 --> 28:04.813
would you like a beer?No, I'd like you
to explain what

28:04.857 --> 28:06.249
you're talking about.

28:06.293 --> 28:07.686
What's not Joel's fault?
What'd he do?

28:09.122 --> 28:10.863
Maybe I need a lawyer.

28:10.906 --> 28:11.820
Why would you need one?

28:11.864 --> 28:12.952
I mean, for my husband.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.040
That's not what you said.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.911
You said you need a lawyer.

28:15.955 --> 28:18.131
For you. Why do you need

28:18.174 --> 28:20.350
a lawyer, Dawn?
What did you do?

28:22.265 --> 28:23.745
Come on!

28:26.008 --> 28:28.707
I shot Sal Marino.

28:30.578 --> 28:31.840
You were in that car?

28:33.276 --> 28:37.280
No, and-and I didn't pull
the trigger.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.847
But it's my fault.

28:38.891 --> 28:41.458
It's all my fault.

28:41.502 --> 28:44.113
Wait a minute,
were you and Sal...?

28:48.117 --> 28:49.510
I...

28:49.553 --> 28:51.207
Joel is a...

28:51.251 --> 28:54.080
He's-he's a wonderful husband
and father and a solid citizen.

28:54.123 --> 28:56.778
But more of a Volvo wagon
than a Lamborghini, huh?

28:59.563 --> 29:02.088
I had a fling with Sal
last summer.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.654
Sal said nothing about this.

29:03.698 --> 29:06.396
Because we both agreed
it was a mistake,

29:06.440 --> 29:08.268
and we promised
not to tell anyone.

29:08.311 --> 29:11.227
But you got a guilty conscience,
and you told Joel about it?

29:11.271 --> 29:12.620
And he goes and shoots Sal?

29:12.663 --> 29:15.014
I mean, never in a million years

29:15.057 --> 29:17.668
would I ever think
he would ever do that.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.805
Yep. Thanks, Juanella.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.502
Photos are coming through now.

29:25.546 --> 29:27.635
You're the best.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.463
Hey. Sit down.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.682
Anthony, you're right.

29:31.726 --> 29:32.945
Say that again?

29:32.988 --> 29:34.555
That you're right?

29:34.598 --> 29:35.991
I so rarely hear it
from your sister.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.645
So, what am I right about?

29:37.688 --> 29:39.429
I've been thinking all weekend
about Alison,

29:39.473 --> 29:41.562
and I think
this might be more about me

29:41.605 --> 29:43.477
than the Beak Street Butcher.Yeah.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.174
Well, I thought
about Vache's, uh,

29:45.218 --> 29:46.828
"Why is everyone
against me?" act,

29:46.872 --> 29:48.525
and something just felt off.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.832
So I called
a pal of mine at DFS.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.355
Uh, they're the ones
that referred the case

29:52.399 --> 29:54.923
that sent him to jail in '09.

29:54.967 --> 29:58.231
They took his license away,
so if he's peddling insurance,

29:58.274 --> 29:59.928
he's doing it
on the black market.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.235
Doesn't make him Ted Bundy.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.627
They're building a new case,

30:03.671 --> 30:06.326
uh, about that accident
that he said he had.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.371
They put a tail on him.

30:09.372 --> 30:12.288
This is an act.

30:13.246 --> 30:14.334
This...

30:15.335 --> 30:17.598
...is the real deal.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.861
Ted Bundy, uh,
wore a cast on his arm

30:19.905 --> 30:22.951
to fool women into thinking
he wasn't a threat.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.911
And now Vache's using that
wheelchair to do the same thing.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.956
Correct.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.271
You're rooting for McKenzie
to succeed, aren't you?

30:38.314 --> 30:39.620
I'm not rooting for anybody.

30:39.663 --> 30:40.882
Don't give me that.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.579
What's McKenzie to you?

30:42.623 --> 30:45.104
It was the judge
who told you to fire him,

30:45.147 --> 30:46.583
and you refused to do it.

30:46.627 --> 30:47.889
Oh, come on, Garrett.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.586
I'm the guy who refused his plea

30:49.630 --> 30:52.981
to go out and clear his name,
and that's why he resigned.

30:53.025 --> 30:55.636
You were his boss,
not his PR flack.

30:55.679 --> 30:59.161
And that judge
was a modern-day Isaac Parker.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.684
What?

31:00.728 --> 31:02.599
Uh, he was a hanging judge
in the Old West.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.906
Oh, of course.

31:04.950 --> 31:09.955
Look, Doug McKenzie
got washed away

31:09.998 --> 31:13.349
by the current climate,
by the mob at his door

31:13.393 --> 31:15.264
and the press
that went along with them.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.918
Still doesn't land on you.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.355
You said the same thing
about Officer Witten.

31:19.399 --> 31:22.576
And now she's Eddie's partner
because, Garrett,

31:22.619 --> 31:26.145
it did land on me,
and in ways you couldn't see.

31:26.188 --> 31:28.451
Enlighten me.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.368
Seriously, I want to know.

31:33.630 --> 31:36.198
To know when and to who

31:36.242 --> 31:39.854
to give benefit of the doubt
is a part of the job

31:39.898 --> 31:43.075
with the absolute worst odds
of getting it right.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.033
So you have to what?

31:46.992 --> 31:50.691
Look for opportunities
for a second chance.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.913
CSU found the print

31:54.956 --> 31:56.827
where McKenzie's guy
touched a counter.

31:56.871 --> 31:59.091
I.D.'d him
as "Ron Whatley."

31:59.134 --> 32:01.571
Runs an auto shop
in Hell's Kitchen.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.573
Then they used
facial recognition software

32:03.617 --> 32:05.010
to compare his face

32:05.053 --> 32:08.013
to a video from one
of the jewelry stores.

32:08.056 --> 32:11.146
And when the perp pulled off
his mask for a half a second?

32:11.190 --> 32:13.018
Bingo.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.497
I sent a team
of detectives

32:14.541 --> 32:15.759
and ESU to his shop.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.152
Just say the word, boss,
we go in.

32:17.196 --> 32:18.719
Do it.

32:20.808 --> 32:24.029
And then send another team
to collar McKenzie.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.727
But he was telling the truth.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.207
On what charge?

32:28.250 --> 32:30.644
Criminal possession
and criminal sale

32:30.687 --> 32:34.822
of stolen property,
both felonies.

32:34.865 --> 32:37.477
Then make sure he gets
in the same cell as Whatley.

32:41.263 --> 32:43.222
Hey, Reagan, you okay?

32:43.265 --> 32:45.659
Yeah, I'm okay. Why?

32:45.702 --> 32:49.010
Well, you kind of stopped
talking the other day.

32:50.925 --> 32:53.536
Because you were
right, and, uh,

32:53.580 --> 32:56.148
honestly, I ran
out of excuses.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.019
How did that happen?

32:58.063 --> 33:02.284
Ah, you said something to
me about me that was true,

33:02.328 --> 33:04.286
and for whatever reason,
I was finally able

33:04.330 --> 33:06.332
to hear it for
the first time.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.116
I get it.What?

33:08.160 --> 33:10.292
I think I'm gonna need
to sit down for a minute.

33:10.336 --> 33:13.295
[phone ringing]Okay, all right, don't faint.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.167
Is that your new partner--
Detective Farrow?

33:15.210 --> 33:17.256
Oh, she's not my
new partner, okay?

33:17.299 --> 33:18.866
You're my partner.Go on.

33:18.909 --> 33:21.173
Answer it.
Just you two do your thing.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.001
Reagan.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.220
He did?

33:25.264 --> 33:27.179
Yep.

33:27.222 --> 33:29.137
All right, I'm on my way.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.617
I got to go.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.227
Oh, don't miss me too much.

33:32.271 --> 33:34.316
I will.

33:38.842 --> 33:41.193
Mr. Vache, police. Open up.

33:45.197 --> 33:47.155
Now what?

33:47.199 --> 33:48.765
Just a few more questions,
if you don't mind.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.767
Where's the other guy?

33:50.811 --> 33:52.204
He's under the weather.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.814
So it's just you?

33:53.857 --> 33:56.382
'Cause I never saw
your badge last time.

33:56.425 --> 33:58.123
Here.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.515
Are you happy?

33:59.559 --> 34:01.430
Sure. Come on in.

34:21.537 --> 34:23.322
[groaning]You okay?

34:34.855 --> 34:36.639
Just go to the ER. We need
to get that thing looked at.

34:36.683 --> 34:37.988
Oh, my hand'll be fine

34:38.032 --> 34:39.729
once I get it wrapped
around this hump's neck.

34:42.776 --> 34:45.083
Hey. Alison, what's going on?

34:45.126 --> 34:46.258
You're not gonna believe this.

34:46.301 --> 34:49.957
I just got a call
from Boris Vache.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.567
What?

34:51.611 --> 34:53.743
It surprised the hell out of
me, too. Must've kept my card.

34:53.787 --> 34:55.832
He said sorry
for blowing me off before

34:55.876 --> 34:57.921
and that he wants to do
an interview

34:57.965 --> 35:00.489
about how he's being
unfairly accused.

35:00.533 --> 35:01.795
Alison, it's Anthony.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.405
Oh. Hi, Anthony.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.278
Please tell me that Vache said
where he was calling from.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.496
He didn't. Sorry.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.107
Did he say when
he wanted to meet?

35:09.150 --> 35:10.673
Today. Now.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.719
He said he'd come to my house.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.460
No, no, no, no.You can't do that.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.983
Guys. Guys,

35:16.026 --> 35:17.332
I-I'm not an idiot.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.465
I told him it had to be
somewhere in public.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.380
It'll be fine.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.776
Thank you for convincing your
husband to come home, Ms. Ross.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.909
Thanks for doing it here
and not the airport.

35:28.952 --> 35:31.041
Did you tell anyone
about this little arrangement?

35:31.085 --> 35:33.087
Well, Marion next door,
and you know this neighborhood.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.046
Yeah, I can see the grapevine
growing by the minute.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.441
Here he comes.

35:39.485 --> 35:41.139
FARROW:Now, remember,
just one hug,

35:41.182 --> 35:42.575
and he's coming with us.

35:53.977 --> 35:54.978
It's okay.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.024
All right, come on.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.244
Come on.

35:59.287 --> 36:00.636
Turn around, Joel.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.203
Mr. Ross, you have

36:02.247 --> 36:03.378
the right to remain silent...

36:03.422 --> 36:04.510
He's not going anywhere

36:04.553 --> 36:06.076
till I get a piece of him!

36:06.120 --> 36:08.166
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!I got this.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.993
He shot my dad!

36:14.476 --> 36:16.043
He's under arrest.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.610
You want a piece of that, too?

36:18.872 --> 36:20.134
No.Then get out of here.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.048
Now!

36:25.400 --> 36:26.923
Wow.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.404
Remind me never
to cross you again.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.275
Is that a compliment?

36:30.318 --> 36:31.624
Actually, it was.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.017
Well done. Come on.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.802
Wow.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.245
NEWSMAN
With the discovery,
the doctors say

36:44.289 --> 36:47.074
they are now isolating
bacterium, and may be able

36:47.117 --> 36:49.598
to come up with a cure
in two years.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.083
You're done
killing women, Vache.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.258
You heard the man.
Drop the knife.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.044
Do it now!

37:16.799 --> 37:19.454
Well, I never thought
I'd be saying this, Alison,

37:19.498 --> 37:21.108
but thanks to you,

37:21.151 --> 37:23.371
Boris Vache will be prosecuted
for murder.

37:23.415 --> 37:24.416
Think it'll stick?

37:24.459 --> 37:25.939
Anthony broke him
in ten minutes,

37:25.982 --> 37:29.464
and CSU found mementos of
his victims in the crawlspace.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.466
So when can I interview him
for my podcast?

37:31.510 --> 37:33.729
Uh, how about never?

37:33.773 --> 37:36.732
Then what was the point?

37:36.776 --> 37:39.344
To take a violent criminal
off the streets.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.302
And justice for his victims.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.695
But how will my listeners know
about it?

37:42.738 --> 37:44.087
I suppose

37:44.131 --> 37:45.785
you're gonna have to tell them.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.526
Okay, I don't think you
understand how a podcast works.

37:47.569 --> 37:49.789
Okay, before
I kick her out, please?

37:49.832 --> 37:51.399
Thank you.Let's go this way.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.488
Headed out. Yeah, sorry.
Tight schedule.

37:53.532 --> 37:55.664
Right this way.

38:01.409 --> 38:04.194
Commissioner.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.764
He's here?

38:08.808 --> 38:10.940
And loaded for bear.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.988
Bring it on.

38:17.512 --> 38:20.341
Perp walk? Really?

38:21.734 --> 38:24.693
Well, it helps if

38:24.737 --> 38:27.827
the Ron Whatleys of the world
think you're one of them.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.655
Because that's what you think.

38:29.698 --> 38:32.484
Because it is easier

38:32.527 --> 38:35.095
if they don't realize
you're back on the job.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.188
Come again?

38:43.408 --> 38:46.149
What's tomorrow, Mr. McKenzie?

38:46.193 --> 38:47.368
Tuesday.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.414
[taps desk]What else?

38:54.636 --> 38:57.857
One-year anniversary
of me turning in my shield.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.381
And a cop who does that,

39:00.425 --> 39:04.167
even in anger,
has one year to reconsider.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.215
My anger was justified.

39:08.258 --> 39:09.912
It still is.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.960
So was my giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

39:17.572 --> 39:19.400
I hope.

39:21.663 --> 39:24.100
What are you hoping for?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.060
That you'll give me the same.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.414
The final call is
at the discretion of the PC.

39:50.605 --> 39:52.390
Thank you, Commissioner.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.784
Glad to be back.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.615
That makes two of us, Detective.
