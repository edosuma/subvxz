24:23.462 --> 24:25.203
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.914
I SAID YOU WON'T
HAVE TO DIE AFTER ALL.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.219
OF BOREDOM, MILLIE MEANS.
DON'T YOU, DEAR?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.012
OH!

24:35.099 --> 24:37.716
YES, OF COURSE. YES.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.644
OH, YES, I'M AFRAID VVE HAVEN'T

24:41.730 --> 24:44.392
WELL, NO. NO, FRANKLY,
FRANKLY, YOU HAVEN'T.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.144
OH, PLEASE
FORGIVE US.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.567
YOU SEE, THE FACT IS
THAT OLD MILLIE AND I

24:48.654 --> 24:52.147
HAVE SPENT MANY FINE
HOURS ON THIS OLD SCOW.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.816
HOURS ONE CAN'T
FORGET EASILY.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.030
VVHEN VVE HEARD THEY VVERE
GOING TO RETIRE HER,

24:57.121 --> 25:00.659
VVE THOUGHT VVE MIGHT JOINED HER
FOR HER LAST TVVO-VVAY SAILING.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.081
<i>YEAH. BASICALLY IT'S TRUE
MOST OF THE OTHERS.</i>

25:03.168 --> 25:06.001
THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO
MANY OLD PARTIES ON BOARD.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.209
OH. OH, WELL, WE
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.381
AND THEY STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.085
VVOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE TEA?
IT'S VERY REFRESHING.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.214
YES, THANK YOU.

25:15.305 --> 25:19.173
<i>ONE THING HASN'T CHANGED. IT'S STILL
THE BEST CUP OF TEA IN THE WORLD.</i>

25:19.226 --> 25:21.263
VVHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHERS MR.
MCKENZIE?

25:21.353 --> 25:23.685
VVELL, AS I SAID, SAME
REASON AS OURSELVES, REALLY.

25:23.731 --> 25:25.392
SENTIMENT, YOU KNOW.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.349
<i>OF COURSE THEY KNOW. WHY SHOULD
THEY CHOOSE THE LADY ANNE?</i>

25:28.444 --> 25:30.230
BLESSED IF I KNOW.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.903
WELL, IT ISN'T REALLY
SUCH A DIFFERENT STORY.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.196
SENTIMENT.

25:34.283 --> 25:37.116
<i>UH, OF COURSE THERE ARE ALL
DIFFERENT KINDS OF SENTIMENT.</i>

25:37.202 --> 25:42.038
AND PARTLY, IT VVAS BECAUSE ALAN I
HA\/EN'T REALLY BEEN ALONE IN SIX YEARS.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.741
EXCUSE ME. I'M GOING
TO GET US A DRINK.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.701
GOOD IDEA.

25:46.754 --> 25:47.915
SCOTCH ALL AROUND?

25:48.005 --> 25:49.120
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

25:49.214 --> 25:50.625
NO, NOT FOR ME,
THANK YOU.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.004
HE'S EMBARRASSED,
ISN'T HE?

25:59.391 --> 26:02.725
I'M SEEM TO BE DOING THAT
TO HIM ALL THE TIME LATELY.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.599
YOU SAID THAT YOU TWO
HADN'T BEEN ALONE.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.976
NO, NO, UH,

26:08.067 --> 26:11.276
ALAN IS A
VERY BUSY MAN AND--

26:11.361 --> 26:15.605
ANYVVAY, VVHEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE VVAS,
THAT HE VVAS GOING TO ENGLAND ON BUSINESS,

26:15.699 --> 26:17.815
I MADE HIM PROMISE
TO TAKE ME,

26:17.910 --> 26:20.322
<i>WHICHEVER WAY
I DECIDED TO GO.</i>

26:20.412 --> 26:22.619
<i>BUT</i> WHY <i>DID YOU
CHOOSE THE LADYANNE?</i>

26:22.706 --> 26:25.744
WELL, UH, I GUESS
IT WAS TIME, REALLY.

26:25.793 --> 26:29.787
YOU KNOVV, MORE TIME TO, TO
BE ALONE TOGETHER AND, UH-

26:29.880 --> 26:32.588
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST SEEMED SPECIAL.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.506
OH, MY DEAR,
SHE IS SPECIAL.

26:34.593 --> 26:38.302
MUCH MORE SPECIAL THAN YOU AND
YOUR HUSBAND COULD EVER IMAGINE.

26:38.388 --> 26:42.427
VVELL, FOR ONE THING, TOBY AND I
SAILED ON HER VVHEN VVE GOT MARRIED.

26:42.518 --> 26:45.510
THAT WAS, UM,
52 YEARS AGO.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.515
FIFTY-THREE, AS
A MATTER OF FACT.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.768
OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HER THEN.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.976
SPLENDID SPECIMEN, SHE VVAS.
THE SHIP I MEAN, NOT OLD--

26:53.070 --> 26:55.027
OH, TOBY, REALLY.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.856
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS AN OLD RUST BUCKET.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.658
NOT IT, DEAR. SHE, SHE, SHE.
DID I SAY THAT?

27:01.745 --> 27:05.204
I SHOULD HA\/E BEEN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
FOR TELLING SUCH A FEARFUL LIE.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.543
<i>USTEN TO ME, DO YOU
KNOW THE LADY ANNE</i>

27:07.626 --> 27:12.211
VVAS THE FAIREST BOAT THAT EVER CROSSED
THE SEAS? QUEEN OF THE FLEET, SHE VVAS.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.210
<i>L5', OLD BO)'. I-S'- NO
OTHER SHIP OAN TOUOH HER.</i>

27:15.300 --> 27:17.507
I BEG YOUR PARDON. QUITE RIGHT IS.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.632
OH, THIS IS OLD IAN BURGESS.
YOU HAVEN'T MET HIM PROPERLY.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.012
<i>MRS. RANSOME.</i>

27:22.099 --> 27:23.840
HOW DO YOU DO?

27:24.852 --> 27:29.062
VVELL, DON'T STAND THERE LIKE A NINNY.
SIT YOURSELF DOVVN.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.857
PLEASE GO ON. YOU VVERE TELLING
ME HOVV SPECIAL SHE IS.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.729
"SHE," SHE SAID.
DID YOU HEAR?

27:34.820 --> 27:36.902
GOOD SHOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.697
SHE VVAS THE ONLY ONE OF HER KIND, MRS.
RANSOME.

27:39.783 --> 27:43.572
SHE SPECIALIZED--OH, NO,
EX/STED FOR HONEYMOONERS.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.653
HER CARGO:

27:45.706 --> 27:47.071
YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.874
YES. THAT'S VVHAT MAKES YOUR
PRESENCE-- OH, HERE HE IS.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.702
COME AND SIT AROUND HERE. CAN YOU MANAGE?
GOOD, GOOD.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.333
THAT'S VVHAT MAKES YOUR
PRESENCE ON BOARD IS SO IRONIC.

27:55.424 --> 27:58.257
IRONIO. NO, THAT'S NOT THE VVORD.
NOT IRONIO. VVHAT'S THE VVORD?

27:58.343 --> 27:59.424
SWEET.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.252
NO, THAT ISN'T IT.
DOESN'T MATTER.

28:01.346 --> 28:07.217
THE FACT IS THAT THIS SHIP VVAS A-VVAS
A-VVAS A REGULAR FLOATING VVEDDING BARGE.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.269
NO ONE ON BOARD EXCEPT
YOUNG MARRIED COUPLES

28:10.355 --> 28:12.517
FULL OF JUICE, AND THE
MOON IN THEIR EYES.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.307
OH, DEAR ME,
YOU'D HAVE LAUGHED.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.860
IT VVAS FUNNY TO SEE THEM TRY TO
PRETEND THEY'D BEEN MARRIED FOR YEARS,

28:17.905 --> 28:19.942
AND ALL THE TIME THEY VVERE
AS NERVOUS AS KITTENS.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.194
DO YOU
REMEMBER, BURGESS?

28:22.284 --> 28:25.527
OF COURSE I DO. BUT ALL
THE NERVOUSNESS VANISHED

28:25.621 --> 28:28.579
ONCE THE <i>LADYANNE</i> HAD GIVEN THEM
ENOUGH TIME TO KNOVV EACH OTHER.

28:28.665 --> 28:32.124
<i>SHE WAS SUCH A WISE LADY. SHE
UNDERSTOOD THESE THEMES.</i>

28:32.211 --> 28:34.794
<i>(Millie) EVERYTHING WAS
DONE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.</i>

28:34.880 --> 28:38.214
I EXPECT, TO THE OTHERS, THE
SHIP SEEMED A BIT RIDICULOUS.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.758
LOVE HAS ITS OVVN
PARTICULAR POINT OF \/IEVV.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.222
IT SEES EVERYTHING
LARGER THAN LIFE.

28:43.263 --> 28:46.221
NOTHING IS TOO ORNATE,
TOO FANCIFUL, TOO DRAMATIC.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.974
LOVE DEMANDS
THE THEATRICAL.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.223
AND THEN
TRANSFIGURES IT.

28:51.271 --> 28:54.889
<i>IT TURNS THE GROTESQUE
INTO THE LOVELY,</i>

28:54.983 --> 28:56.894
<i>AS A CHILD DOES.</i>

28:56.985 --> 29:01.320
<i>WITH IT, WE CAN SEE WHAT WE
WISH TO SEE IN OTHER PEOPLE.</i>

29:01.406 --> 29:04.023
WITHOUT IT, WE CAN'T
SEE ANYTHING AT ALL.

29:06.870 --> 29:10.659
VVE CAN SEARCH FOREVER
AND NE\/ER FIND.

29:10.749 --> 29:15.243
HCVV A SHIPPING COMPANY E\/ER HAD THAT
PARTICULAR POINT CF \/IEVV, I CANNOT IMAGINE.

29:15.337 --> 29:19.251
<i>BUT THEY TURNED THE LADY</i> ANNE
<i>INTO AN ENCHANTED GONDOLA</i>

29:19.341 --> 29:21.753
AND TOOK THAT
MOMENT OF HAPPINESS

29:21.843 --> 29:26.178
AND MADE IT Ll\/E FOR TVVO
UNSPEAKABLY VVONDERFUL VVEEKS.

29:26.265 --> 29:30.429
I THINK THEY GET THE DRIFT, MILLIE.
NO NEED TO GO ALL STICKY ON US.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.181
I FEEL STICKY.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.435
YES, WE ALL
LOVE THIS SHIP.

29:36.483 --> 29:39.020
WHEN WE HEARD SHE WAS
GOING TO BE RETIRED,

29:39.111 --> 29:42.695
VVE THOUGHT IT ONLY RIGHT TO
JOIN HER ON HER LAST JOURNEY.

29:42.781 --> 29:46.365
MOST THE PEOPLE ARE HERE
FOR THE SAME REASON.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.864
MAJOR JONES IS JUST
BEHIND ME, THE BALD MAN,

29:49.955 --> 29:52.617
<i>WITH HIS WIFE.
HE WAS AN ENGINEER,</i>

29:52.666 --> 29:55.283
AND A VERY GOOD
ONE, IN HIS DAY.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.957
AND THE COUPLE
ON THE LEFT THERE,

29:59.047 --> 30:01.209
<i>THE WHITEAWAYS.
CHARMING COUPLE.</i>

30:01.300 --> 30:05.715
<i>THEY WERE MARRIED ON THE
SHIP 41 YEARS AGO TOMORROW.</i>

30:05.804 --> 30:09.013
OH. THE CHAP SITTING
OVER THERE ALONE

30:09.099 --> 30:12.057
<i>IS OTTO CHAMPION,
THE WRITER.</i>

30:12.144 --> 30:13.805
<i>SUREL Y YOU'VE
HEARD ABOUT</i> H I <i>M.</i>

30:13.895 --> 30:16.227
VVE USED TO CALL HIM OTTO
OF ROSES IN THE OLD DAYS.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.976
HE WAS SUCH A ONE
WITH THE LADIES.

30:18.025 --> 30:21.814
<i>YOU WOULDN'T THINK SO TO LOOK AT
THE POOR OLD CHAP NOW, WOULD YOU?</i>

30:21.903 --> 30:27.319
HE'S A VVIDOVVER. HIS VVIFE DIED IN '28.
UH, NO, '29.

30:27.367 --> 30:31.235
<i>YEAH, '29, THAT'S RIGHT. THE
DAY TRIGO WON THE DERBY.</i>

30:31.371 --> 30:33.988
<i>WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SHE DIED IN '33,</i>

30:34.082 --> 30:35.914
<i>THE YEAR HYPERION
WON THE DERBY.</i>

30:36.001 --> 30:38.743
<i>OH, ANYWAY, IT WAS
ROUND ABOUT THAT TIME.</i>

30:38.837 --> 30:42.922
<i>GOOD HEAVENS, LOOK. THERE'S OLD
LORD BRISTOL. HE CAN HARDLY WALK.</i>

30:43.008 --> 30:44.248
<i>IS HE ALONE?</i>

30:44.343 --> 30:46.675
DECENT SORT OF FELLOW.
YES, I'M AFRAID HE IS. YES.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.341
WHAT ABOUT YOU,
MR. BURGESS?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.136
THE SAME.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.519
SHE'S LOVELY.

31:00.609 --> 31:04.022
VVE INTENDED TO DO THIS
TRIP TOGETHER BUT, UH-

31:10.535 --> 31:13.448
OH, NO, MY DEAR.
PLEASE. I'M SO SORRY.

31:13.538 --> 31:17.202
WE'LL BE TOGETHER
AGAIN SOON.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.623
I'M SORRY.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.920
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR. NOTHING
MATTERS IF YOU'RE IN LO\/E.

31:23.924 --> 31:25.335
YOU ARE IN LOVE,
AREN'T YOU?

31:29.388 --> 31:32.221
YES. OF COURSE.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.973
<i>WELL, THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS.</i>

31:35.060 --> 31:37.893
ARE-ARE YOU
BETTER NOW, DEAR?

31:37.979 --> 31:40.391
YES, YES, I'M-I'M-

31:40.440 --> 31:42.272
I'M SORRY.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.895
<i>IT'S QUITE
ALL RIGHT.</i>

31:43.944 --> 31:47.153
<i>I CRY MYSELF
SOMETIMES, DON'T I, TOBY?</i>

31:47.239 --> 31:48.570
SOMETIMES?
ALL THE TIME.

31:48.657 --> 31:49.897
OH, NO.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.779
WELL, I DON'T.
IT DEPRESSES ME.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.452
I SAY, VVHY DON'T YOU TVVO GO
OUT AND GET SOME FRESH AIR?

31:55.539 --> 31:57.405
IT'LL DO YOU GOOD.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.410
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.080
NOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:45.297 --> 32:46.537

32:46.631 --> 32:49.214
THE, UH, SUN.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.635
WELL, WHAT ABOUT IT?

32:53.722 --> 32:56.464
IT'S, UH, BEHIND US.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.476
SO, IT'S BEHIND US.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.856
WELL, IT WAS OVER
THERE YESTERDAY.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.982
THAT MEANS WE'RE
HEADING NORTH.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.938
SO WE'RE
HEADING NORTH.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.321
WE SHOULD BE
HEADING EAST.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.824
BLAME IT ON ME.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.411
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.166
WHY NOT THIS?

33:36.681 --> 33:39.343
I DON'T KNOVV VVHAT I'M
DOING ON THIS CRAZY BOAT.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.519

I DOUBT IT. IT'S NOT EASY TO
FALL OVERBOARD, YOU KNOVV.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.835
SHE MAY BE LOOKING

35:12.027 --> 35:14.359

37:29.873 --> 37:31.830
IT ISN'T A PITY.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.418
IT'S A CRIME!

37:35.086 --> 37:38.829
[slurring] A CRIME PERPETRATED
BY STUPID MEN IN BOW TIES.

37:38.923 --> 37:42.336
NOVV, NOVV, EASY, BURGESS.
NOTHING TO GET OVERHEATED ABOUT.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.009
NOTHING?

37:44.095 --> 37:46.837
ARE YOU SO-SO
FEEBLE MINDED

37:46.931 --> 37:48.922
THAT YOU CAN'T
SEE THE TRUTH?

37:49.017 --> 37:51.975
DON'T YOU REALIZE VVHY THEY'RE
GOING TO SCRAP THE <i>LADYANNE?</i>

37:52.061 --> 37:54.439
OUTLIVED HER
USEFULNESS, I SUPPOSE.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.024
OH, NONSENSE.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.269
SHE'S THE FINEST SHIP
AFLOAT. YOU DENY IT?

37:58.318 --> 38:00.309
CERTAINLY NOT.

38:00.403 --> 38:04.112
OH. SHE MAY BE
A LITTLE SLOW, PERHAPS,

38:04.157 --> 38:06.649
BUT 13 OR 14 DAYS

38:06.743 --> 38:10.361
OUGHT TO BE QUITE FAST ENOUGH FOR
ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.945
THAT'S JUST IT.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.330
PEOPLE AREN'T IN THEIR
RIGHT MINDS ANYMORE.

38:14.417 --> 38:18.206
<i>THEY SACRIFICE LEISURE FOR SPEED. AND
SPEED'S THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS.</i>

38:18.296 --> 38:21.209
<i>COME, QUICK, HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.
FAST, FASTER, FASTER.</i>

38:21.299 --> 38:24.963
<i>GET IT OVER WITH.
WHY? WHY THE RUSH?</i>

38:25.053 --> 38:27.966
DON'T GET SO QUERULOUS, OLD MAN.
IT'S BAD FOR YOU.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.548
IAM NOT OUERULOUS. IAM
MERELY TRYING TO POINT OUT

38:30.642 --> 38:33.134
THE TRUE REASON FOR THIS
DISGRACEFUL DECISION.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.392
WHICH IS?

38:34.479 --> 38:39.064
A PLOT. OBVIOUSLY
OF COMMUNISTIC ORIGIN.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.312
<i>THEY'RE GOING TO
CONDEMN THE LADY</i> ANNE

38:41.361 --> 38:44.570
<i>BECAUSE SHE REPRESENTS
A WAY OF LIFE. THE OLD WAY.</i>

38:44.656 --> 38:47.193
SHE HAS
GRACE, MANNERS,

38:47.283 --> 38:48.899
TRADITION.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.734
AND NOW THEY'RE
GOING TO SCRAP HER.

38:50.829 --> 38:54.072
OH, I SAY! SOMEBODY
TURN HIM OFF.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.702
NOTHING IS
SACRED ANYMORE.

38:56.793 --> 38:59.751
THE BEASTS ARE AT THE GATES, BUT
VVE'RE TOO OLD TO FIGHT THEM,

38:59.838 --> 39:03.081
SO VVE HA\/E TO STAND AROUND
LIKE A LOT OF PATHETIO STATUES

39:03.174 --> 39:06.257
WITH OUR MEDALS TARNISHED
AND OUR SWORDS BROKEN,

39:06.344 --> 39:09.382
WHILE THE VANDALS TURN
OUR CASTLES INTO SIDESHOWS

39:09.472 --> 39:13.761
AND STICK UP NASTY LITTLE ADVERTISEMENTS
FOR SOAP ALL ALONG THE ROADSIDE.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.844
AND NOW THEY'RE GOING
TO SCRAP THE <i>LADYANNE.</i>

39:16.896 --> 39:19.103
BUT I WARN YOU,

39:19.190 --> 39:23.684
HOVV ARE VVE GOING TO STOP THEM
FROM SCRAPPING THE VVHOLE VVORLD?

39:28.741 --> 39:30.778
POOR OLD BOY.
YOU MUSTN'T BLAME HIM.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.577
YOU SEE, HE'D PLANNED TO MAKE
THIS TRIP VVITH HIS VVIFE.

39:33.663 --> 39:38.032
AND THEN, A FEVV VVEEKS AGO, SHE HAD
TO GO AND DIE ON HIM, POOR OLD BOY.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.868
<i>WELL, WE'LL HAVE
THE PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT.</i>

39:40.920 --> 39:42.786
<i>HE MAY FEEL
BETTER THEN.</i>

39:42.881 --> 39:45.623

MR. RANSOME?

39:45.717 --> 39:47.424
NO? ALL RIGHT.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.210
<i>DRINKING ALONE?</i>

40:28.801 --> 40:31.589
VVHERE HA\/E YOU BEEN? I'\/E

40:31.638 --> 40:32.924
I'VE BEEN HERE, ALAN.

I'M NOT DRUNK.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.051
WHERE DID THIS
COME FROM?

41:10.134 --> 41:12.216
MRS. MCKENZIE
GAVE IT TO ME.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.840
SHE WORE IT ON
HER HONEYMOON.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.888
DO YOU LIKE IT?

41:16.975 --> 41:19.012
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

41:19.102 --> 41:20.968

41:59.267 --> 42:02.931
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
THEY'RE YOUR LETTERS.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.683
I'VE HAD THEM
HOW LONG A TIME?

42:05.732 --> 42:08.019
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH THEM, EH?

42:08.109 --> 42:10.521
BURY THEM.

42:10.570 --> 42:13.107
I DON'T NEED

I'M VERY HAPPY
TO MEET YOU.

42:47.106 --> 42:49.097

45:52.375 --> 45:54.491
WHY SHOULD WE GATHER
OUR THINGS TOGETHER?

45:54.585 --> 45:58.920
BECAUSE, MY FRIENDS, VVE'RE
PUTTING YOU OFF THE SHIP.
