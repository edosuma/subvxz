01:04.040 --> 01:07.360
You could call Bangkok
a tale of two cities

01:07.440 --> 01:09.120
with two worlds in one.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.160
The Hollywood image of Bangkok at night

01:13.240 --> 01:17.200
evokes neon lights,

01:17.280 --> 01:20.200
the underworld, and extreme partying.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.080
But the real Bangkok is so much more.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.600
At night, the real Bangkok
is a place bursting with creativity.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.680
The energy and competition
of over ten million inhabitants

01:31.760 --> 01:35.280
inspire an innovative spirit in the city.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.960
Anything is possible
for young people here.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.080
Early evenings in Bangkok
are chaotic and full of traffic jams.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.440
Life here is frenetic and competitive.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.600
That's what throws up great new ideas.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.080
It's like an adventure

02:30.160 --> 02:33.040
because the city is always changing.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.800
But while Bangkok is one of
the world's most visited cities,

02:36.880 --> 02:40.000
many people miss out on the diversity

02:40.080 --> 02:42.320
and creativity of the local scene.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.400
Some of its newest and most unusual venues

02:44.480 --> 02:48.760
are hidden in corners
that many tourists don't know about.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.200
Near Chinatown lies Soi Nana.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.880
It's transformed from
a neighborhood of old businesses

02:55.960 --> 02:58.680
into one filled with cool bars.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.880
One of the pioneers
who saw potential in Soi Nana

03:06.960 --> 03:09.520
was Niks Anuman-Rajadhon.

04:22.800 --> 04:27.920
<i>Like their drinks,
the team at Asia Today is a great mix.</i>

04:29.160 --> 04:32.720
<i>One of them is Makham Tamaryn Cooper.</i>

06:16.080 --> 06:18.880
For those of you
who are new here, don't panic.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.880
I'm not asking
for everything to go perfectly.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.880
Just for you guys to survive.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.160
Let's go, team. Let's go.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.320
FRIED CHICKEN AND STICKY RICE

07:48.040 --> 07:50.960
Bangkok is a city that never sleeps.

07:51.040 --> 07:54.680
Hello, stop by and grab a bite.
We've got seats available.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.320
There's energy. There's freedom.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.440
Each night is different.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.520
Put the beef on the grill.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.880
At our stall, we sell pork and beef.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.760
There are northern sausages,
pork sausages,

08:08.840 --> 08:10.160
fermented sausages, and grilled chicken.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.680
But people come for our pork skewers
with fermented fish sauce.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.360
Tonight, I think we're probably
going to sell around 5,000 skewers.

08:24.400 --> 08:30.280
I grew up near Bangkok,
just a couple of hours away.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.240
It actually all began
when I came to visit my dad

08:35.320 --> 08:37.280
who was operating the stall.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.919
But business wasn't good.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.159
Walk into the alley a bit

08:43.240 --> 08:45.320
and you'll see Hero Moo Plara.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.720
We're open daily.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.560
My father used to be chubby
with a big belly.

08:51.640 --> 08:56.120
But he was in debt
and wasn't sleeping or eating much.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.960
I felt like

08:59.560 --> 09:02.720
I needed to do something.
So I stayed to help my father.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.600
At first, I didn't like Bangkok at all.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.840
But I had to stay.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.880
THAI NORTHEASTERN STYLE SAUSAGES

09:12.960 --> 09:16.040
I tried the food.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.880
The dipping sauce was our signature.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.720
But it was too watery

09:20.800 --> 09:22.440
and not very spicy.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.720
I knew right away
that we had to make changes.

09:26.720 --> 09:30.680
I experimented and changed the recipe.

09:30.760 --> 09:35.000
There are lemongrass, galangal,
and kaffir lime leaves.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.680
Actually, there are many more ingredients,

09:37.760 --> 09:41.320
but I can't tell you
because it's a secret.

09:42.160 --> 09:47.280
Next comes our special
fermented fish sauce.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.120
It smells amazing.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.160
We didn't want it too sweet.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.080
Our pork is sweet already.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.280
So when we pair it
with the salty fermented fish sauce,

10:03.360 --> 10:05.120
the taste is perfectly balanced.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.240
I went with my gut feeling
that if I like it, others will too.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.720
It's spicy at first, then rich

10:13.800 --> 10:16.280
and delicious
with some saltiness to finish.

10:17.240 --> 10:20.560
Customers finished the bowls
of the dipping sauce we served.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.080
And many asked for more.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.840
The sauce here is so rich.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.600
And the pork is so tender.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.960
I'll keep coming back.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.160
Nun. Your order is ready.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.160
Ten pork skewers and sticky rice.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.640
That'll be 105 baht.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.120
We used to sell only
about 20 or 30 kilograms' worth.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.440
These days, we can sell over a hundred.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.560
The younger generation
has energy and ideas.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.400
I'm proud of my son.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.600
Please wait to be called.
When we call your name,

10:54.680 --> 10:55.680
you can go get vegetables over there

10:55.760 --> 10:58.400
-and pay.
-What if we can't remember the name?

10:58.480 --> 11:00.000
If you can't remember the name,

11:00.080 --> 11:01.240
you'll starve.

11:01.320 --> 11:05.040
Thanks, everyone,
for coming to Hero Moo Plara.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.880
We used to have one mat for customers.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.600
These days, even 40 mats aren't enough.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.000
It's really unbelievable.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.720
I never thought we'd come this far.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.200
Even if our stall isn't a restaurant
inside a building,

11:27.280 --> 11:31.520
it's become a part of Bangkok.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.080
I love Bangkok at night.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.720
I've fallen for its charms.

12:15.440 --> 12:20.840
<i>Likay is a traditional theatre
long adored by Thais.</i>

12:20.920 --> 12:24.520
<i>Likay is more popular in rural areas</i>

12:24.600 --> 12:27.800
<i>because there's less of a community
in Bangkok these days.</i>

12:27.880 --> 12:29.520
Get your makeup on, kid.

12:29.600 --> 12:34.120
<i>But the Two Princes Likay Troupe,
run by brothers Nack and Neno,</i>

12:34.200 --> 12:36.160
<i>is looking to change that.</i>

12:38.720 --> 12:45.200
We formed the Two Princes Likay Troupe
in 2010.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.280
But in Bangkok,
they think Likay is outdated.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.720
During our first performance,
the audio broke down after 30 minutes.

12:58.840 --> 13:03.000
Another time we only had about
ten fans in the audience,

13:03.080 --> 13:05.240
and four or five stray dogs.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.520
I wondered, "Are we going to make it?"

13:10.160 --> 13:13.080
But once you start fighting,
it's like getting on a tiger's back.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.560
You can never get off.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.880
I decided to change our style.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.880
I was a Bangkok kid,

13:22.960 --> 13:26.640
and we grew up watching a lot of TV.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.080
Back then, superhero costumes

13:29.640 --> 13:30.880
were everyone's dream.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.520
They wore those suits.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.640
There was that thing
behind with the hat and mask.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.880
Here. You'll be wearing
"the Dark Knight" costume.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.920
Today, you'll be "Batman."

13:44.840 --> 13:46.440
This is my brother, Neno.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.440
He's super hot. He's got lots of fans.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.400
Do you have a girlfriend?

13:55.200 --> 13:57.320
-Don't say that.
-No girlfriends allowed.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.320
He's so hot,
the sugar mamas will be upset.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.640
I made my brother
and the troupe wear them,

14:03.240 --> 14:05.400
and we became like "the Avengers" gang.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.400
When Nack first came up
with Likay Superheroes,

14:09.480 --> 14:11.240
I was against it.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.760
But Nack insisted we give it a go.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.280
I remember someone said,

14:18.360 --> 14:20.160
"I'm not watching that freak show Likay."

14:20.240 --> 14:23.560
I was like, "I don't care."

14:36.080 --> 14:37.840
We took and combined a lot of styles.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.040
Tales of royalty or ghosts,

14:41.120 --> 14:43.000
we changed them to stories
about everyday people.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.480
We added comedy.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.480
Look at my friend!

14:47.560 --> 14:49.080
Look at his scar!

14:49.160 --> 14:52.120
-Did you get slashed?
-It was my appendix.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.160
At first, we were criticized like crazy.

14:59.320 --> 15:02.320
But it got the attention
of a new generation of fans.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.120
The place where we once performed
to a few people,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.360
is now filled with thousands.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.680
I'm crazy!

15:10.760 --> 15:12.120
I'm crazy!

15:14.600 --> 15:18.400
When we perform in and around Bangkok,

15:18.480 --> 15:22.400
we get kids and parents
who have never heard of Likay.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.600
But they came across us
on YouTube and Facebook.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.280
I'm proud of my brother.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.480
I want these kids to know

15:33.560 --> 15:35.200
that these are our roots.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.160
This is what being Thai is about.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.600
As long as I'm still breathing,

15:41.680 --> 15:45.080
the word Likay
will never disappear from Thailand.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.360
I'm a night person.

16:08.240 --> 16:13.040
The allure of Bangkok lies
in its variety and mystery.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.520
There are endless places to discover.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.480
People think nightlife in Thailand

16:19.560 --> 16:22.440
has nothing new to offer,

16:22.520 --> 16:25.160
that there's no progress.

16:25.640 --> 16:28.480
Actually, there are so many
nightlife scenes in Bangkok.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.040
There are hidden bars,
cocktail bars, rooftop bars.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.840
There's a community of new DJs here
who are really talented.

16:47.560 --> 16:51.720
Celeste Siam is one of
Thailand's biggest musical exports,

16:51.800 --> 16:55.920
who's performed overseas for many years.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.360
She recently moved back to Thailand

16:59.440 --> 17:04.760
to help Thai artists
gain more recognition and success.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.920
Firstly, has anyone tried this?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.599
Never, right?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.680
This is called the pitch control.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.040
We can adjust the speed.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.760
The first kick. Can you hear it?

17:21.839 --> 17:22.760
The very first one.

17:22.839 --> 17:23.720
Count the beat.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.760
One, two, three, four.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.720
One, two, three, four.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.760
One, two, three, four.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.120
Ten years ago,
there were almost no female DJs.

17:44.240 --> 17:50.040
As a newbie, I sometimes
needed venue DJs to help me set up.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.240
Many would help.

17:56.320 --> 18:02.240
Many others disconnected the cables

18:02.320 --> 18:04.560
and just walked away.

18:05.240 --> 18:11.120
I went through a lot,
but I stayed positive and grateful.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.960
I never dreamt
that I would become Celeste Siam.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.680
I wanted to come back
to play music in Bangkok again.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.520
In the city where I grew up.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.320
I wanted to help share my experience
and bring in new music.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.000
To do whatever I can to help.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.440
<i>Safe room is another great example
of the creativity hidden</i>

18:37.120 --> 18:40.760
<i>in the nightlife of Bangkok's residents.</i>

18:42.680 --> 18:45.960
<i>It's a reimagined space
that used to be a bank</i>

18:46.040 --> 18:48.640
<i>and is now a pioneering venue</i>

18:48.720 --> 18:51.320
<i>for the local
underground electronic scene.</i>

18:52.240 --> 18:54.120
Let's get one with the light!

18:57.000 --> 19:00.800
Safe Room is a real underground club.

19:00.880 --> 19:05.720
Its concept is to support local artists,

19:05.800 --> 19:08.720
newcomers, and new events.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.000
There are many young DJs and fans

19:12.080 --> 19:15.240
that haven't had
a chance to see me play before.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.880
Takky! We walked by each other earlier.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.280
Just now, right?

19:22.360 --> 19:24.640
Yes. Aren't you one of the twin sisters?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.080
Yeah, I usually play solo.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.680
The music I am going to play tonight is
a style I like called organic house.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.200
Melodic Deep Tech.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.040
The audience in Bangkok
is always open to new things.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.160
The moment I start the track,

19:48.240 --> 19:49.760
I watch to see how they react.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.720
Will they move when they hear the beat?

19:52.800 --> 19:55.480
I try to take control of the crowd.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.160
It's a really fun challenge.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.920
It's like going on an adventure together
from the start till the end of the show.

20:32.120 --> 20:36.960
In the past, we didn't have much choice
of where to go out.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.880
Now, we're growing our community
of DJs, the electronic music industry,

20:40.960 --> 20:45.040
and our nightlife in Bangkok.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.520
It's an exciting time.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.880
Whenever I collect herbs from the garden,

21:05.960 --> 21:08.320
I feel at peace.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.320
It doesn't feel like I'm in Bangkok.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.360
This is similar to water spinach.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.400
But in Thai, it's called <i>"pae tum pung."</i>

21:18.800 --> 21:20.080
Nowadays, we hardly see it.

21:21.640 --> 21:26.520
Bangkok's culinary scene
is full of inventiveness.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.160
There's a new generation
of chefs exploring fresh,

21:29.240 --> 21:33.680
creative ways of working
with local ingredients.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.200
Chef Tam Chudaree Debhakam is
one of those chefs.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.640
And evenings at Baan Tepa are

21:39.720 --> 21:42.680
an immersion into the story
of the meal itself.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.880
to see if they can come
to enjoy it at the end of the meal.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.920
My interest in food
began when I was young.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.400
All my family members are foodies.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.240
I spent some time working in New York.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.520
When I came back to Thailand,
I felt a bit lost.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.880
So I decided to travel.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.800
I went to Chiang Rai.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.160
I lived on a mountain,

22:51.240 --> 22:55.000
where the locals cooked me
their traditional dishes.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.960
It was the moment that changed everything.

23:05.400 --> 23:09.280
I discovered all these new ingredients,
new ways of seasoning,

23:09.360 --> 23:12.560
and all these different
regional cooking styles.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.040
I felt like there must be something

23:16.120 --> 23:19.320
I could bring back to those in Bangkok
who've never tried them.

23:20.040 --> 23:26.120
I saw the potential of what Thailand
had to offer to a chef like myself.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.960
At Baan Tepa,

23:41.040 --> 23:46.480
the experience that we want to offer
our guests is not just delicious food,

23:46.560 --> 23:50.960
but also the story behind it.

23:51.040 --> 23:55.440
You could say
we're reviving old style Thai cuisine

23:55.520 --> 23:58.840
with Thai ingredients people might not
even recognize anymore.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.560
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hello.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.640
<i>Baan</i> means home

24:11.720 --> 24:13.720
or house.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.320
It's the perfect name

24:16.400 --> 24:19.040
because this is my family home.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.680
Our garden tour is like
an appetizer for our guests.

24:47.760 --> 24:52.560
They can get to taste the raw ingredients
before coming inside for a meal.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.120
-This is tarragon.
-Okay.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.400
Yes, I got this plant from Chiang Rai.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.240
You'll get to eat it tonight too.

25:01.800 --> 25:07.000
As far as I know, we're one of
the first to do this in Bangkok.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.160
This one is such an invasive species.

25:09.240 --> 25:13.720
A way to stop it from being
a weed is to eat it as food.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.760
It's a great concept, right?

25:17.600 --> 25:19.360
Right this way, please.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.520
Three people on this side
and one on that side.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.240
An evening is all we have
to get our message across.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.720
This dish uses produce
from our own garden.

25:54.080 --> 25:57.800
The green liquid is sour mango juice
that we infused with tarragon.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.880
We smelled it in the garden earlier,
so I'd love for you to try it.

26:00.960 --> 26:01.960
Use your spoon.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.400
We keep our fingers crossed each night.

26:17.520 --> 26:21.840
When I first saw it, I was nervous
because it looked so green.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.400
So I wondered
if I was going to be able to eat it.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.600
But once I tried it,

26:25.680 --> 26:28.560
I got the connection
with the garden we saw.

26:28.640 --> 26:33.040
It's the concept of Thai cuisine
where everything is balanced,

26:33.120 --> 26:36.120
so nothing dominates.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.240
Wow, so crunchy!

29:32.600 --> 29:34.360
Makham, she's famous.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.600
Everyone should come
and check out her cocktails.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.160
They all have her unique signature.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.400
That's too much, bro.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.240
Let's raise our glasses!

30:30.240 --> 30:34.880
The lights may always be on
at night in Bangkok,

30:34.960 --> 30:38.400
but it still offers hidden corners
worth exploring.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.520
It awakens our five senses.

30:43.080 --> 30:46.320
We smell the aroma of food,
hear car horns beeping,

30:46.400 --> 30:48.680
and see neon lights.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.080
We get to taste strange new things
unlike anywhere else on earth.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.160
It creates novel spaces and experiences

30:59.240 --> 31:02.120
to express who you are.
