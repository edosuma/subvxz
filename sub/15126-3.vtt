00:06.560 --> 00:10.560
..Two tributaries of humanity,
but here, this pump,

00:10.560 --> 00:15.760
the signifier of that which unites
all. All men made in one image.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.800
So I declare unto you
that God is light,

00:18.800 --> 00:21.760
and in Him is no darkness at all.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.480
GROANING

00:23.480 --> 00:27.200
If we say that we have
fellowship with Him

00:27.200 --> 00:30.720
and walk in darkness, we lie,
and we do not tell the truth.

00:30.720 --> 00:35.280
That if we walk in the light,
as He is in the light,

00:35.280 --> 00:39.680
then we have fellowship,
one with another.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.360
MAN RETCHES

00:46.480 --> 00:47.840

00:57.800 --> 00:59.640
Off him, you jackals and vermin!

01:13.080 --> 01:15.800
Help me, my guts.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.960
Stay away from the water.
It is the King returned.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.040
King Cholera.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.320
I have sandwiches too.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.000
You are kind to me, Mrs Reid.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.960
I would take greater
care of you, Kathleen,

02:44.960 --> 02:48.240
if you'd name the man who would
work you and then punish you so.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.600
Kathleen?

02:54.600 --> 02:55.720
No, Mrs Reid.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.480
If you were you my friend,
you wouldn't ask me this thing.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.280
You might at the least have
prepared a picnic, Reid.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.440
Some German wine, perhaps.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.920
I do not come here
to seduce, Inspector Ressler.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.600
Well, then why, Reid? Hobbs!

03:32.480 --> 03:33.560
Six, sir!

03:37.040 --> 03:39.960
Elizabeth Jackson.
You lay claim to her, do you not?

03:39.960 --> 03:43.440
Her dissected remains made
landfall here. Blackfriars.

03:43.440 --> 03:47.200
On Corporation land.
A case for the City Police.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.160
That makes her my case,
not yours. You question this?

03:52.160 --> 03:55.360
That parts of her washed up here?
No. Her provenance, however...

03:55.360 --> 03:58.720
Provenance, Reid? Where she came
from. Where she was butchered.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.320
Whether she is
a Ripper victim at all.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.320
The lad shouted "six".

04:03.320 --> 04:07.520
Yes, I heard. Six is the number I
had painted on a sack of pig-flesh.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.600
It weighs the same as that
package that washed up here.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.880
I have had numerous such packages
dropped into the river

04:13.880 --> 04:16.399
at various intervals on both banks.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.680
Number six began its
journey in Battersea.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.680
So this sack of pork has made
its way five miles east of there?

04:23.680 --> 04:26.240
This river has strong
currents, Mr Ressler.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.400
An eastward flow from the source,
westward with the rise of the sea.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.600
The tide and time are apiece with
the day of Miss Jackson's discovery.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.720
As this sack went into the river
in Battersea, then so did she.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.760
But the Ripper cuts his swathe
here. The City and the East.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.280
This woman is not such!

04:41.280 --> 04:43.880
No! No, she must be.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.120
This girl was diced,
separated and put into the river

04:47.120 --> 04:49.080
in order to obscure her murder.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.720
The Ripper would have us sit up and
pay heed, have men, men like you,

04:54.720 --> 05:00.360
Inspector, clamour to add your
names to the tally of those who
have wandered after him.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.280
Inspector Reid!
Whitechapel calls you back, Reid.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.040
Inspector Reid!
Forget your dismay, inspector.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.920
Have it from me and remember it well.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.120
You want no part of this parade.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.280
Inspector Reid,
you must come immediately.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.800
Morning to you.
And to yourself.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.280
You are alone here?

05:42.280 --> 05:45.080
The world hides in fright
when there's rumour of cholera.

05:47.400 --> 05:52.640
But not yourself. No, sir. I make
my home where men's fear lies.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.600
I fight it for them.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.040
Then you are welcome here.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.600
The dead man is here?
He is, sir.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.040
Mr Jackson and Mr Drake
delivered him to us.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.800
You question whether his
death is a matter for us?

06:21.800 --> 06:25.800
It is a medical issue, is it not?
If any more are dead,
it'll be one of public order.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.960
Then should the water
pumps be broken?

06:27.960 --> 06:29.800
Not until we confirm cholera.

06:29.800 --> 06:33.360
Its water keeps most of
this populace above ground.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.360
We close the pumps, they'll be
drinking from the river in a day.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.640
And the dead will line the streets.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.440
He's rigid. A spasm
at the point of death.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.880
The jaw is locked, but...

06:53.280 --> 06:54.880
The gums are discoloured.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.920
The tongue's engorged.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.080
All the signs.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.080
You have word out enquiring
after other choleroids?

07:05.080 --> 07:07.200
I do, sir. And nothing.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.000
Fouled his fine suit too.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.520
I was not here in '76,
the last time the King cut
his way through these streets.

07:21.080 --> 07:24.560
Sudan, sir. I missed
that particular party.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.240
'75. I was in New Orleans
when he came.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.680
Each town, each settlement.
Men, women and child rotting.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.920
Food for flies.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.680
We must expect more, then?

07:40.880 --> 07:43.440
I'll get him open. Get you sure.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.800
He had no other effects on him?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.520
He was scavenged
before they saw what he was.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.400
This is a financial paper.
He's a City man.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.240
This may not be our problem.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.320
Indeed. But a news vendor has
written here. An address, perhaps?

07:59.320 --> 08:02.640
We should cross to Corporation
land, find his home,

08:02.640 --> 08:05.240
see if others there suffer or no.

08:05.240 --> 08:09.120
Reid, this is a whale, not a man.
I'm going to need a hand in here.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.040
They say no infection
may pass through it.

08:13.040 --> 08:17.080
Hobbs, the dead room requires
an assistant. Go to Captain
Jackson, see what he wants.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.520
You'll enjoy that, Hobbs.

08:18.520 --> 08:19.840
Yes, sir.

08:21.120 --> 08:25.920
Sergeant Artherton, I want
all other men out where people
can see them, not hiding in here.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.440
And any man found wearing a mask,
I shall personally see them

08:32.440 --> 08:34.400
exposed to one of
Mr Lister's bacteria.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.960
We'll not alarm these
people by our absence.

08:39.080 --> 08:45.080
Kathleen, please, this man who
sells you, sells you and beats you,

08:45.080 --> 08:47.560
you protect him and he will
send you back here.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.360
You and twenty others like you.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.920
Perhaps he will, Mrs Reid.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.720
But a woman has to work to find
food and lodging in this city.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.440
I work to find you that lodging.

08:56.440 --> 09:00.520
And will there be any
that does not insist upon
churching me every Sunday?

09:00.520 --> 09:04.040
Upon my knees, listing
the sins I got on my back?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.760
RETCHING

09:07.760 --> 09:09.040
Help me! Nurse!

09:13.880 --> 09:15.480
He's a big man, Hobbs.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.800
When I cut, he's liable to fall away
some, you're going to help me.

09:18.800 --> 09:23.200
Sir? See, the tissue
must be drawn back...

09:25.800 --> 09:29.800
..to reveal the breastbone.
Now, I need you to hold it.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.680
Now pull.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.240
Just peel the flesh back
gently, evenly, while I cut.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.960
The breastbone is held
in place by cartilage.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.480
We need to cut the lower jaw here.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.760
The breastbone comes...off.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.280
Pull the tongue and the trachea.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.760
And now to access where
this man's killer lives.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.240
And where's that, sir?
The bowel, Hobbs.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.120
The bowel.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.960
We step out of our jurisdiction
now, Sergeant. Tread carefully.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.680
DOGS BARK

10:16.680 --> 10:17.760
Ma'am.

10:19.440 --> 10:22.040
Money never begat courtesy, Bennet.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.200
No, sir.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.800
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where this is delivered to?

10:41.680 --> 10:43.760
Delivered each morning.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.720
Our presence here marked.
City Police, sir.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.880
Let them mark it.

10:49.520 --> 10:53.040
It's a German named Koch
that saw them first.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.080
Grew them too.

10:57.080 --> 11:00.440
Cholera bacillus in a jar.

11:00.440 --> 11:04.480
Saw how it loved
dirt and dank earth,

11:04.480 --> 11:07.240
how it lived to breed
and spread in river basins.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.600
And how if your glass
was strong enough...

11:13.720 --> 11:16.000
..you could actually
see it in a man's gut.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.240
And do you see it, sir?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.920
No. No, Hobbs. I do not.

11:24.080 --> 11:27.240
Captain Jackson. Word comes
from the dispensary, sir.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.680
More dead? Not yet, sir.
But many sick.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.640
If it's not cholera,
then what? Find Reid, Hobbs.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.560
Number 26, sir. We'll take a look.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.600
You're Metropolitan Police
and beyond your jurisdiction.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.360
I suffer no obligation to you.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.800
You will give us access.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.640
Or I shall take you where
we shall find you your obligation.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.800
My thanks to you.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.080
Sir?

12:15.440 --> 12:16.480
Is she dead?

12:20.800 --> 12:23.520
No. Opium, Sergeant.
Have a look around.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.920
Wake up, wake up.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.920
What?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.240
Ow, who are you?

12:55.240 --> 12:58.080
The police, wench, is who we are.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.240
Whose lurk is this? Mine.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.160
The truth, toffer.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.560
Mine in name. His in spending. His?

13:06.560 --> 13:09.440
Big man. Small eyes.
Pink like a pig.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.480
S'right. How's your health?

13:11.480 --> 13:15.360
Well, my arm hurts, but
apart from that... Cramps, vomiting?

13:15.360 --> 13:19.280
No! Why? What's his name,
the man that installs you here?

13:19.280 --> 13:23.280
Winston. Algernon Winston.
He was with you last night?

13:23.280 --> 13:26.800
He was. Raging all night
about his head and his belly.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.840
Place of work? I dunno.
I swear it. Why would he tell me?

13:30.840 --> 13:33.200
I don't care to ask which
Jew fills his pockets.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.160
Then it's a bank? Course it's
a bleeding bank! In the street?

13:36.160 --> 13:39.280
You ever walk him back there
after a night on your back?

13:39.280 --> 13:41.480
New Inn. Huge black door.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.080
So where is he, then?

13:49.080 --> 13:52.520
He's cold clay, woman.
As gone as your girlhood.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.080
Best find another fine
suit to climb inside.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.040
Off your patch twice in a day, Reid?

14:04.040 --> 14:05.440
Put in for transfer?

14:05.440 --> 14:08.240
We'd need grander manners
and blacker boots for that.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.120
Aye, and a poker up our arseholes.
What is it your pit-dog says?

14:11.120 --> 14:14.560
You enquire after my presence here,
here's the reason for it.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.200
I've a resident of your
square mile on my slab,

14:17.200 --> 14:21.800
grey and stinking and every
mark on him telling me cholera.
Keep your voice down, man.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.680
And keep your men
off my manor. Hobbs?

14:24.680 --> 14:28.400
A message for you, sir. You're
needed at the Eastern dispensary.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.320
What, Constable? Are there more?

14:32.520 --> 14:33.960
Don't think this forgotten.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.600
WOMAN: Fetch a nurse.
Fetch her quick.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.240
RETCHING

14:55.880 --> 14:58.600
BABY WAILS

14:58.600 --> 15:00.240
Emily?

15:00.240 --> 15:02.760
Edmund? Are you sick?
No, I am well.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.640
Then why are you here?

15:04.640 --> 15:07.360
I was visiting.
One of your women?

15:11.680 --> 15:13.240
Reid!

15:13.240 --> 15:14.600
Mrs Reid. Captain.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.040
It spreads.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.960
Indeed. Is it what we fear?
Well, that depends on what you fear.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.840
The fat man, his insides
have a story to tell.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.520
But that story ain't cholera.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.400
What else could afflict so many?

15:30.600 --> 15:31.640
I don't know.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.400
Then what...?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.800
What the hell is he doing here?

15:42.360 --> 15:45.400
Ressler, you have an insight
into what is happening here.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.240
Now is your moment to tell me.
Why do you follow us?

15:49.720 --> 15:50.920
I have others.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.720
Dead in such a way? How many?

15:52.720 --> 15:56.320
Four in two days. Four!
And you have kept this silent?

15:56.320 --> 16:00.240
A panic in the City!
We close for business, New York
makes a million in our place.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.400
And now the dead of
Whitechapel flush you out.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.800
We have a contamination.
But of what? From where?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.720
Ah, this hell! Hell rises up!

16:10.720 --> 16:11.880
They rave.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.480
Reid, one of mine. A waiter.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.880
The word was, he fled from
the eating house he served,

16:17.880 --> 16:20.640
stripped in the street and gave
himself to God's protection.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.240
You have heard of ergotism?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.600
I'm with you. Ergotism?

16:27.600 --> 16:30.320
It is a fungal infection
on the rye grain.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.960
It's milled into the food chain.

16:31.960 --> 16:35.040
Sustained exposure can lead
to ravings and visions.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.480
Sssh, I need you
to tell me how you feel.

16:40.480 --> 16:44.000
I burn, sir! My feet
and my fingers are aflame!

16:44.000 --> 16:45.960
Burning sensation
in the extremities.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.480
Medievals knew it as
St Anthony's Fire.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.760
Reid, ergotism. The man on my slab,

16:50.760 --> 16:53.040
it doesn't account for
the manner of his passing,

16:53.040 --> 16:55.000
the gastric collapse
that preceded it.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.120
And yours the same?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.400
Puked and shat themself to death?

16:59.400 --> 17:00.920
Yes.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.600
Well, we have a start, Captain.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.680
There is a test for ergotism, is
there not? Ehlrich's reagent.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.359
Ressler, you will bring
your dead to my laboratory.
Reid, I cannot simply...

17:09.359 --> 17:11.000
You can, you will!

17:11.000 --> 17:14.720
Captain Jackson will make comparison.
We'll work on finding a bacteria

17:14.720 --> 17:18.000
that unites these deaths. Tell us
what we fight against. Very well.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.680
Sergeant Drake, you and I
have interviews to conduct.

17:20.680 --> 17:25.240
We should learn from these, how they
may have ingested this infection.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.720
Reid, I need you to bring me one.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.880
A body near death. I need
to study how it take 'em.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.520
Go with him.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.720
What is this that
strikes here, Edmund?

17:38.720 --> 17:40.560
I hope to find out. Go home, Emily.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.480
I have appointments in town
with possible sponsors...
And I would have you safe

17:44.480 --> 17:47.040
and crossed off the roll
of those I fear for.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.360
Please, Emily, go home!
You forget how my every day is,

17:50.360 --> 17:52.400
how I have feared for you,

17:52.400 --> 17:55.600
and how those fears
have been proved accurate?

17:55.600 --> 17:58.840
I would do more with my life
than sit by the fire

17:58.840 --> 18:00.400
in grief and anxiety.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.880
You dedicate your life to your
service and at some sacrifice.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.280
All I ask is that you
allow me the same.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.000
Boil your water, Emily. Eat nothing
that has not been sealed.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.440
With me, Sergeant.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.680
Food?

18:38.680 --> 18:40.320
Jedzenie? Pic?

18:41.840 --> 18:44.240
Nothing? How long?

18:47.120 --> 18:48.720
Three, three days?

18:51.640 --> 18:52.680
I am sorry.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.920
RETCHING

19:04.880 --> 19:10.280
This contamination. We have
Winston. Ressler has his dead.

19:10.280 --> 19:15.000
All this, it is the same
affliction, but none yet die.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.480
And what should
we learn from this, sir?

19:17.480 --> 19:19.000
I know not. Not yet.

19:21.440 --> 19:25.200
Sergeant Drake, have a Maria
brought to the porter's exit.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.800
Sir?

19:26.800 --> 19:28.880
I think we have
the Captain's case study.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.320
What's your name? George.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.520
George. George, I have
a mind to take you from here.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.160
To where? To peace.
Four walls, a bed.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.880
The devils that chase you
will not find you there.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.160
It tests positive for ergotism.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.240
But that cannot be all.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.920
My husband.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.760
Dead some ten years now.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.800
I had not been told
you were also bereaved.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.000
Yes.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.640
A daughter.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.880
I see.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.520
Hmm, you lose a girl,

21:33.520 --> 21:36.200
and come to me seeking
the funds to house a hundred.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.600
He seems strong. He will fight.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.240
In which case, he is ideal.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.880
Any change in this man's temper,
you call Captain Jackson.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.000
Inspector Reid!

22:04.800 --> 22:06.320
I...

22:06.320 --> 22:07.880
..bring out my dead.

22:10.160 --> 22:14.200
In our shelter, women would
find care and compassion.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.040
And we would make
them safe, Mrs Gable.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.160
And improve them also?

22:19.160 --> 22:22.720
If they seek to improve
themselves, we will help them.

22:22.720 --> 22:26.360
Through prayer and their
promise of chastity?

22:26.360 --> 22:29.440
Through whatever means
they choose for themselves.

22:30.920 --> 22:36.560
No mention of their sin?
On God's place in their redemption?

22:36.560 --> 22:41.440
Ma'am, I fear such emphasis
will only turn them away in the fear

22:41.440 --> 22:44.240
that judgement and
punishment await them.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.960
Mrs Reid...

22:50.440 --> 22:52.920
My husband was held as a good man.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.160
A good husband to myself.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.320
And how, our family
made a point of saying,

22:59.320 --> 23:02.280
how unlucky we were not
to be blessed with children.

23:04.240 --> 23:08.760
The imputation being how unlucky
he was to find himself burdened

23:08.760 --> 23:11.600
with so barren a wife.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.840
Mrs Gable, I'm...I am deeply
sorry for your trouble, but...

23:14.840 --> 23:17.760
Do you not wonder at
the reason for this curse, hmm?

23:19.560 --> 23:24.760
At my husband and his prowling
through your Whitechapel laneways.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.920
At the dripping pinchcocks
with whom he lay

23:27.920 --> 23:32.320
and whose foulness he came
home to put inside his wife.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.520
That man, this, this Ripper.

23:36.520 --> 23:40.320
I celebrated his judgement
and his punishment.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.000
Please, Ma'am, I am not well.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.240
And I have no pity for you.

23:44.240 --> 23:47.640
I considered your proposal
perhaps worthy of endowment.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.240
That indeed an institution where
these women may come to see

23:51.240 --> 23:54.240
the sin and error of their
ways might prove a corrective

23:54.240 --> 23:58.080
to their number on the streets. But
instead you come here to insult me

23:58.080 --> 24:02.080
with your talk of compassion.
For whores, Mrs Reid. For whores!

24:02.080 --> 24:04.200
I must...

24:13.160 --> 24:15.720
Are you all right, missus?
Are you all right?

24:20.800 --> 24:22.720
We have ergot.
That can't be all.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.560
You think a cocktail?

24:24.560 --> 24:27.920
Then this is not contamination
by misadventure. It is poison.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.680
Deliberately constructed.
It does not act immediately.

24:30.680 --> 24:35.080
There are those afflicted
who have not eaten for days.
It acts by accumulation.

24:35.080 --> 24:39.440
Seduction. The body absorbs it
in increments, becomes weakened.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.720
Can't fight and then death follows.

24:41.720 --> 24:45.040
Your men continue their survey
of all afflicted? They do.

24:45.040 --> 24:48.080
First results are inconclusive.
There's a lot of gin.

24:48.080 --> 24:51.120
And more than half are
on the skillet. Skillet?

24:51.120 --> 24:54.240
Water and flour, in a stir.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.520
And what is made with it?
It is drunk, Mr Ressler,

24:56.520 --> 25:00.040
by those who cannot find nutrition
elsewhere. Violence and persecution

25:00.040 --> 25:02.400
have driven them a thousand
miles from their home.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.400
They choose these streets for safety
and shelter, find murder and mayhem
in their stead.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.840
And now they cannot eat,
for fear that may kill them also.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.400
Get these dead open. Find out
what relationship the contents of
their insides bear with each other.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.320
There are many still live.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.920
If you decipher this poison,
they may remain so.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.560
CHILD LAUGHS IN THE DISTANCE

25:41.080 --> 25:42.720
LAUGHTER CONTINUES

25:59.360 --> 26:02.480
LOUDER LAUGHTER

26:15.640 --> 26:19.280
Bennet! Bennet, will you,
will you do me a service?

26:19.280 --> 26:23.640
Name it, sir. Mrs Reid. I
may not leave here at this time

26:23.640 --> 26:25.800
but I would know she was...well.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.640
It will be my pleasure, sir.

26:28.640 --> 26:33.240
Drake. Take a turn past
Tenter Street, as well, will you?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.480
God!

26:40.200 --> 26:42.400
GROANING

26:42.400 --> 26:43.440
God help me!

26:47.240 --> 26:51.240
So you boil all water. You eat
nothing that cannot be heated first.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.240
And nothing preserved or canned

26:53.240 --> 26:56.120
that has not been made
so in the last six months.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.160
Thank you.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.800
And should you see Miss Rose...
I'll keep her safe, Sergeant.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.600
Don't worry.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.080
Mrs Reid?

27:32.160 --> 27:33.200
Mrs Reid?

27:36.800 --> 27:37.880
Mrs Reid?

27:41.760 --> 27:44.320
Mrs Reid, it's only me.
It's Sergeant Drake.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.440
Mrs Reid?

27:50.600 --> 27:51.920
Mrs Reid?

28:01.760 --> 28:02.920
You'll be all right.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.600
His temperature soars.
His pulse too.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.880
Sir. Your name?

28:25.880 --> 28:27.960
The name's Jackson.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.640
And I am George.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.120
It's good to know you, George.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.960
No, sir. It is not.
For I am a bad man.

28:36.960 --> 28:40.080
George, there are none
of us that are good.

28:40.080 --> 28:43.440
Now, listen to me. I need you
to tell me what you feel.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.720
My guts, sir. They churn
like they're full of nails.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.920
What else? Do you burn?

28:52.120 --> 28:53.160
Do you see things?

28:54.600 --> 28:58.720
Yes, sir. Demons, that rise in me.

29:00.080 --> 29:03.040
I would speak of my sins.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.480
All men sin.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.720
But none so bad as I.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.600
Reid, is that preacher
still lurking by your door?

29:12.840 --> 29:15.240
They talk of the Ripper
as if he was the first

29:15.240 --> 29:16.760
to bring violence to a woman.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.800
But I know that feeling, sir.

29:21.240 --> 29:25.400
How they bend to a fist
driven hard into their kidneys.

29:25.400 --> 29:28.080
The fear in their eyes to see
a knife at their throat.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.920
My God, am I forsaken?

29:38.520 --> 29:41.880
I'd wager so, brother. I'd wager so.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.960
Name's George, Preacher.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.600
George, my son.

29:49.600 --> 29:54.400
Joy shall be in heaven over
one sinner who have repenteth,

29:54.400 --> 30:01.400
more than nine and ninety just
persons who need no repentance.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.280
GEORGE SPLUTTERS

30:09.200 --> 30:11.400
Was anything learnt here?

30:11.400 --> 30:13.920
I don't know. Get him to the lab.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.640
His eyes, they were conjunctival.
And what of it?

30:18.640 --> 30:22.600
The other substance you look
for could be some kind of heavy
metal compound. Arsenic?

30:22.600 --> 30:27.720
Perhaps. But how, how is it packaged
and delivered to these men?

30:30.720 --> 30:35.520
There's alum husks here.
Lodged. Resisting digestion.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.760
Alum? From unprocessed flour?

30:37.760 --> 30:39.960
Skillet, most likely.
A pie, perhaps.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.280
And in these first men?

30:45.440 --> 30:48.200
Bread. Much processed.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.520
Processed? Ground to the extreme.

30:50.520 --> 30:53.960
All nutritional value
removed from it. White bread.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.280
But still flour. Yes.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.040
So this cocktail that our poisoner
constructs is made, ground,

30:59.040 --> 31:01.760
powdered and then milled into flour.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.360
My God.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.320
Skillet, pies, pastries, cakes.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.000
It is in everything.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.600
Run your tests, Captain,
find what it is we face.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.640
Fetch the Inspector.
Tell him Mrs Reid is sick.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.240
Get the inspector's bed out.

31:19.160 --> 31:22.480
Help me with her head.
That's it, that's it.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.120
How bad is it, Bennet?
She'll be fine.

31:29.080 --> 31:32.520
She's a strong woman, sir.
Please, bring towels and water.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.040
Emily, we have you safe.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.280
We have you safe.

31:41.280 --> 31:44.160
And we apply ourselves to what
will take this sickness from you.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.000
The Marsh Test, gentlemen.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.120
That shelf, if you please, Sergeant.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.880
The brown bottle,
sodium hypochlorite.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.520
And pour me a glass, will you?

32:06.440 --> 32:09.320
If this residue dissolves,
it is arsenic.

32:09.320 --> 32:11.720
And if it does not?
Then there is but one other.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.800
Reid, should you not be with her?
I am no use to her there.

32:17.840 --> 32:18.920
Well?

32:25.520 --> 32:29.080
It is antimony. A fatal toxin.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.400
In amalgam with ergot.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.880
Such a death.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.960
This man, he is an evil one.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.200
Then we must find him,
sir, and stop him.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.160
Easy to say, Sergeant.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.160
He may do his work at bakery,
at mill, at wholesale.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.160
He may be in Dundee
for all we know. No.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.760
He will be hid in these
streets somewhere.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.040
Watching.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.360
I know this type of man.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.240
He wants his work seen.

33:16.520 --> 33:21.160
MEN SHOUT OVER MACHINERY NOISE

33:41.720 --> 33:44.760
Our pimp here gives
up his life yesterday

33:44.760 --> 33:48.280
and we must assume
others also. Yet these...

33:51.760 --> 33:53.960
..dead some 36 hours or more.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.600
A breather between them and this.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.240
Two waves of attack.
The first, small. Five men.

33:59.240 --> 34:02.520
The second wider, we know not
how many, indecipherable.

34:02.520 --> 34:05.600
Yet these, these first we may study.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.080
They must show us the way
to our poisoner. Mr Ressler,

34:08.080 --> 34:12.040
you must have thought
on the details of these men,
commonalities that might bind them?

34:12.040 --> 34:14.920
I have, of course. But nothing.
No. We do not allow nothing!

34:14.920 --> 34:18.280
There must be a connection!
Reid, iodine in the cabinet.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.560
What are they doing now?
If you don't know and I don't,

34:22.560 --> 34:25.800
sir, it's often best not to ask.
First to last, if you please.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.080
First to die, Mr Ressler.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.600
Yes, erm, of course, um...

34:32.719 --> 34:34.639
First. Name?

34:34.639 --> 34:35.960
Er, Dursley.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.199
If I may?

34:46.960 --> 34:48.239
Hackett.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.159
Blackstone.

34:56.639 --> 34:57.800
Grubb.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.760
And Winston.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.720
Correlation? They made their
living within Corporation Land.

35:11.720 --> 35:14.560
We are there already, Mr Ressler.
Beyond that, nothing.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.000
Dursley, a surgeon,
practice on King William's Street.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.840
Hackett, a clerk
at Barings, third level.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.880
Blackstone, a busboy
at Sweetings restaurant.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.640
Grubb, an under-manager
at Lloyds of London.

35:29.640 --> 35:33.040
This man, your man, name
of Winston, a broker at Goldman's.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.080
He lived within the square mile.

35:35.080 --> 35:38.760
He, Marylebone,
travelled by carriage.

35:38.760 --> 35:43.760
Hackney, by omnibus. Stepney, also
omnibus, different route, however.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.440
Blackstone, your very own
Whitechapel,

35:46.440 --> 35:48.120
took to his feet each day.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.600
No sign or record they knew one
another from a hole in Bishopsgate.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.840
Then we must look harder. Drake,
do you have your map? Yes, sir.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.960
Dursley, Grubb. Omnibus routes?

35:58.960 --> 36:02.320
Dursley, Bethnal Green Road.
Grubb, Whitechapel Road.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.360
Places of work?
Here and here.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.520
Mr Dursley could have
disembarked here, sir,

36:07.520 --> 36:10.160
cut down Commercial
Street to his work.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.520
All roads lead to Whitechapel.
Indeed and our waiter, Blackstone,

36:13.520 --> 36:16.560
on foot to Sweetings also.
That doesn't wash, Reid.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.920
These two, Winston and Hackett.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.720
He in the square mile itself,
he west of there.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.680
What would bring them here?
What has always brought men here?

36:30.800 --> 36:32.480
Captain, a hand lens.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.920
In his rooms I found a sugar
mixture, a knife, some muslin.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.200
I thought it for his woman, but if
you remember, she was a blonde.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.680
And naturally so. The remaining
hair on the muslin was dark.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.160
He strips himself?
On his chest, yes.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.400
His legs are also stripped so.

36:56.400 --> 37:00.600
You're asking yourself, does
this man like to play a lady?

37:00.600 --> 37:05.520
This man, Hackett, I found
something...irregular in his gut.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.000
What? Semen.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.440
And you thought not to say!

37:10.440 --> 37:12.480
Well, it had no relevance.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.480
Look, whatever raises another
man's flag is no business of mine.

37:15.480 --> 37:19.640
Mr Ressler, whether these two
played backgammon together or no,

37:19.640 --> 37:22.320
it is a current upon
which they both float.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.520
Ready a carriage for
Winston's apartments.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.360
We shall pick it clean for anything
which speaks of these desires.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.080
And we may have our link.

37:38.960 --> 37:42.200
You know what this is.
Can it be stopped?

37:44.560 --> 37:47.400
In a body that's recently
ingested its first dose,

37:47.400 --> 37:52.280
an enema or lavage might
remove it, but beyond that,

37:52.280 --> 37:55.680
Reid, you've seen this for yourself.
It does not kill in one strike.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.840
A strong body might fight it off.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.440
For those of who it has
already taken its grip,

38:01.880 --> 38:04.560
science, medicine,
they only take you so far.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.560
And then they drop you like a stone.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.480
Captain, I only ask you this.
Will you keep watch over Mrs Reid?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.680
Consider it done.

38:22.680 --> 38:25.240
Reid, your wife.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.480
You have what men have always had.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.360
What is that, Captain?

38:31.360 --> 38:32.400
Hope.

38:47.680 --> 38:48.720
Mr Reid, sir?

38:51.080 --> 38:53.760
Word comes from the dispensary.
And the London as well.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.120
They start to die.

39:02.480 --> 39:08.440
God of all creation, send forth
your power to heal these afflicted.

39:08.440 --> 39:12.400
You cleansed the lepers,
gave sight to the blind

39:12.400 --> 39:16.960
and by simple command empowered
the crippled to rise up and walk.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.560
I know this bawdy house.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.200
Mr Reid.

40:41.520 --> 40:45.360
FALSETTO VOICE SINGS

40:51.120 --> 40:53.120
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

40:53.120 --> 40:55.280
Police! Everybody, stay calm.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.400
Sit, sit, sit, sit!

40:56.400 --> 40:58.880
Everybody stay where
they are and stay calm.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.720
This is no raid.
This is no raid! Sit down!

41:01.720 --> 41:04.240
Get your hands off!

41:04.240 --> 41:06.040
Then calm your men!

41:06.040 --> 41:07.560
Calm yours, madam!

41:07.560 --> 41:11.880
You have my word. All this quarter
know I prosecute no bawdy house.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.120
Even one such as mine?
Even that.

41:15.800 --> 41:19.680
Madam, there are two men I would
seek your help in placing.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.920
Mr Ressler, your likenesses.

41:21.920 --> 41:25.120
Prepare yourself. They might have
looked differently when they lived.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.920
They visited here, yes.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.400
Regular? Lunchtime each day.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.800
And you fed them, madam?

41:37.400 --> 41:41.280
No, sir. This is no chop house.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.400
The Molly House.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.320
The Molly House.

41:48.320 --> 41:53.360
Here. Mr Winston's work at
Barings, Mr Hackett's - Goldman's.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.120
So they find their lunch
on their way back to their desks?

41:56.120 --> 41:58.880
So we presume. I must take an
interest in this section here,

41:58.880 --> 42:02.360
where the routes are joined. Ressler,
the omnibus stations you spoke of?

42:02.360 --> 42:05.440
Dursley here. Grubb here.

42:05.440 --> 42:08.240
And Blackstone, our waiter,
his home and route?

42:08.240 --> 42:09.280
Here to here.

42:10.600 --> 42:14.000
This web of streets,
a convergence where they meet.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.800
We walk these routes,
then? We do.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.640
We must find the place at which
their lives intersected

42:19.640 --> 42:22.920
and hope to learn from it why
they are joined in death also.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.040
Inspector! Look.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
'A milling for new
customers, Mrs Gable.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.840
'A special batch.

43:26.840 --> 43:30.240
The bakers of London will all soon
be shouting our name, ma'am.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.280
Hmm.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.520
These can go, Harris.
This way, ma'am.

43:38.560 --> 43:42.560
'As you see, all is
ever as it should be.

43:42.560 --> 43:45.280
Yes, I can see as it ever should be.

43:45.280 --> 43:48.240
It is you that insists on
these inspections, not myself.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.280
It is your mill, Ma'am.

43:50.280 --> 43:56.120
It is ever important to us that you
see what work we perform for you.

43:56.120 --> 43:59.000
Of course. Lead on, Mr Claxton.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.040
Lead on.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.080
Good day, gentlemen.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.280
Same time next week, Mr Claxton?

44:08.280 --> 44:09.840
Of course, Mrs Gable.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.800
You'll be ready, I'm sure.

44:13.880 --> 44:17.400
Ready as ever, Ma'am.
Sergeant, no man leaves.

44:17.400 --> 44:22.040
Inspectors Reid and Ressler, police.
Your names and business here.

44:22.040 --> 44:24.960
Flora Gable. I am proprietor.

44:24.960 --> 44:26.720
Claxton. General manager.

44:26.720 --> 44:30.040
Well, Mrs Gable, Mr Claxton,
a batch of flour you sold went bad.

44:30.040 --> 44:32.000
Bad? Men died.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.600
This sickness? Yes, ma'am.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.920
Mr Claxton, help these men.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.920
Yes, of course.
Please, come with me.

44:40.920 --> 44:44.880
The batches are all logged and
recorded. You have the number? I do.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.760
The number, sir?
Mr Ressler will give it to you.

45:02.760 --> 45:03.960
Thank you, sir.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.120
This your office, Mr Claxton?
It is, sir. Yes, sir.

45:17.760 --> 45:21.000
You install these cabinets yourself?
If memory serves, sir.

45:22.440 --> 45:26.080
Reid, every man likes a good
cabinet, but is this quite the time?

45:42.720 --> 45:46.440
Did you notice the dimensions
of this room from without,
when we entered?

45:46.440 --> 45:48.520
It is a rectangle, Mr Ressler.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.720
Now we are inside,
how does it look?

45:56.720 --> 45:59.200
Like a cube, Reid. It does so.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.800
Mr Ressler.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.800
MRS GABLE GASPS
Reid!

46:36.320 --> 46:39.920
I have worked hard,
Mr Reid. And now, look,

46:39.920 --> 46:44.480
it is synthesised as a liquid.
Much faster in its actions.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.400
An increased agony in death, also.

46:49.120 --> 46:51.040
Mrs Gable? Yes.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.600
Those papers on the desk. Yes.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.800
Take them, please.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.880
The steel bin at your feet.
Drop them in there.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.320
Those matches on the desk.

47:03.640 --> 47:04.680
Strike them.

47:09.560 --> 47:10.920
And burn the papers.

47:15.520 --> 47:16.920
The delivery details.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.760
If you please, we shall leave now.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.360
MRS GABLE SCREAMS

47:29.360 --> 47:30.600
Please, don't!

47:37.640 --> 47:40.000
Drake! Sergeant Drake!
Mr Reid, sir!

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
Stand your man down, Reid!
Drake, he has the poison! Stay back!

47:44.000 --> 47:48.200
Drake, you recall a conversation
we had some while ago on John
Stuart Mill and his philosophy?

47:48.200 --> 47:51.200
I do, sir. His principle of
happiness. And do you recall what,

47:51.200 --> 47:54.440
when faced with a choice, he held
the proper course of action to be?

47:54.440 --> 47:57.480
Whatever would lead to
the greater well-being, sir.

48:03.440 --> 48:06.400
Tell me where it is!
Tell me where the rest of it is!

48:06.400 --> 48:09.680
I will tell you nothing,
nothing. Only this.

48:09.680 --> 48:12.960
There is more,
more even than before,

48:12.960 --> 48:17.520
making its glorious way into
this world this very moment.

48:17.520 --> 48:20.240
Reid! Your evil
has poisoned my wife!

48:20.240 --> 48:22.160
We'll get nothing if you kill him.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.400
Not if I kill him immediately, no.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.880
Get him strapped
to a cot in our dead room.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.440
You are going to save
lives, Claxton! No!

49:12.440 --> 49:14.240
Edmund...

49:15.880 --> 49:18.240
Edmund, I see her...

49:21.000 --> 49:22.720
..our darling.

49:24.240 --> 49:28.320
I see her aflame and in water.

49:30.680 --> 49:35.040
You listen to me.
You listen to me. You stay alive.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.760
Stay alive. You live.

49:46.920 --> 49:50.240
HE GASPS

50:10.720 --> 50:13.760
Curious as to your
interest, Mr Claxton.

50:16.880 --> 50:20.120
That man. The Ripper.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.840
His brutality.

50:26.120 --> 50:31.440
How many? Seven? At most?

50:34.280 --> 50:38.720
And his name, all set to haunt
this city for a thousand years.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.160
I have already tripled his score.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.880
Think how long they'll talk of me.

50:57.440 --> 51:00.880
They will talk of you
to the same extent

51:00.880 --> 51:04.080
they have the length
of your life so far.

51:04.080 --> 51:07.360
Precious little, I should think,

51:07.360 --> 51:11.520
which may go some way to explain
your need to make it otherwise.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.960
Now, it is already abroad

51:13.960 --> 51:17.640
that this was an accident, terrible,

51:17.640 --> 51:20.240
but a contamination,
not a poisoning.

51:20.240 --> 51:24.800
Your employer, Mrs Gable, stands
by to confirm this to all who ask.

51:24.800 --> 51:30.560
You, Mr Claxton, will be quite,
quite forgotten, I promise you.

51:33.600 --> 51:36.920
But not by those whose loved
ones are in our hospitals.

51:36.920 --> 51:40.320
Not by you, eh, Mr Reid?

51:40.320 --> 51:42.520
Not by you.

51:42.520 --> 51:43.840
Nor by your wife.

51:44.960 --> 51:46.600
Steady, sir, steady.

51:53.480 --> 51:54.520
Captain Jackson.

51:57.280 --> 52:01.200
My surgeon. He is American.

52:02.680 --> 52:07.200
Now, which is the more urgent?
The pain of your arm or the ergot

52:07.200 --> 52:10.560
and antimony that sprint,
even now, through your innards?

52:18.120 --> 52:20.160
There's still time
for you, I'd imagine.

52:21.520 --> 52:25.360
Then, please, wash it from me.

52:25.360 --> 52:26.400
Really?

52:28.080 --> 52:30.800
Would you rather not have
me examine this break?

52:30.800 --> 52:33.320
No, no!
HE SCREAMS

52:36.000 --> 52:39.360
A pity for you that we have had
a run on our stores of anaesthetic.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.880
If you tell us where your
last consignment is sent for,

52:41.880 --> 52:45.200
we might find that after all,
we have some spare.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.000
Captain Jackson, how long before
this toxin makes its way

52:48.000 --> 52:50.880
from gut to bloodstream?
I shall never tell you.

52:52.280 --> 52:55.480
My death shall join the great
number I have put in this world.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.000
Again.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.080
HE SCREAMS

53:05.040 --> 53:06.200
Until he tells you.

53:06.200 --> 53:09.400
CLAXTON SOBS

53:11.000 --> 53:13.120
Dearest Father of all mankind...

53:13.120 --> 53:14.520
DISTANT SCREAMING

53:41.440 --> 53:42.600
He has given it to you?

53:44.960 --> 53:47.720
Yes, sir. Everything.

53:47.720 --> 53:51.080
We have the delivery details,
the batch number.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.800
Thank you, Bennet.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.920
Emily.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.120
My own sweet Emily.

54:15.960 --> 54:19.760
If you will only come back to me,
I will, I will tell you.

54:21.680 --> 54:25.960
I will tell you why I am the way
I am and why I cannot mourn her...

54:29.320 --> 54:30.680
..like you do.

54:36.720 --> 54:38.640
Please.

54:38.640 --> 54:40.440
I will do anything.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.760
SHE MOANS SOFTLY

54:43.760 --> 54:45.480
Emily! Emily! Emily!

54:54.080 --> 54:57.280
Edmund, she was waving to me.

55:00.040 --> 55:02.240
My darling was calling me on.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.400
Mrs Reid.

55:30.720 --> 55:33.600
You may have heard that
the mill is to be sold.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.120
I did.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.320
Your first endowment.

55:48.280 --> 55:51.760
More will follow on the first
day of each and every month.

56:01.520 --> 56:03.240
Without judgement,

56:03.240 --> 56:07.320
without punishment and
without God if need be?

56:13.360 --> 56:15.080
As you would have it, Mrs Reid.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.400
Thank you. I must go.

56:31.480 --> 56:36.200
You are fixed on this plan,
then, despite all that has passed?

56:36.200 --> 56:37.320
I am.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.160
I am and with greater conviction.

56:44.480 --> 56:48.280
Edmund, it was your will
kept me alive those hours.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.080
It is a powerful force.

56:53.120 --> 56:54.920
Please do not set it against me.

57:11.160 --> 57:16.160
Reid, I cannot help but think
the man's further excesses,

57:16.160 --> 57:19.640
his need to move beyond
that initial batch...

57:19.640 --> 57:23.920
Dozens have perished,
your wife almost among them...

57:23.920 --> 57:27.280
Had I not bowed to pressure
to keep those bodies secret,

57:27.280 --> 57:29.480
the public knowledge
of those deaths

57:29.480 --> 57:32.040
might have been enough
to sate his madness.

57:32.040 --> 57:35.280
Word of advice, Ressler.
This work we perform,

57:35.280 --> 57:37.320
it does not serve to look backward.

57:39.360 --> 57:43.480
This city, wickedness will
ever leave its spores here.

57:43.480 --> 57:46.120
You and I, we are not magicians,
we cannot see through walls

57:46.120 --> 57:48.240
or into men's minds.

57:48.240 --> 57:53.080
Dozens perished, but hundreds
who were ill are now well once more.

57:55.280 --> 57:56.400
We fight.

57:57.800 --> 58:00.000
We fight with all
the skills we may muster.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.720
Beyond that, we may do no more.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.200
Can you remember what it was
brought you here?

58:18.200 --> 58:19.840
His blood was shed all upon you.

58:21.040 --> 58:23.200
What did you see?

58:23.200 --> 58:24.480
'Tis my darkness.
