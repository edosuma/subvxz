WEBVTT

00:00.045 --> 00:02.513
You're under arrest
for the murder of Marty Shay.

00:02.620 --> 00:03.746
There must be some mistake.

00:04.989 --> 00:08.151
<i>Just explain to me how you kept
your head in three tours in Vietnam,</i>

00:08.326 --> 00:11.818
and then got somehow momentarily
confused into confessing murder.

00:11.963 --> 00:13.260
<i>Somehow,
I don't think those guys</i>

00:13.364 --> 00:14.797
are gonna be too thrilled
to see us.

00:14.932 --> 00:15.990
Freeze! Police!

00:16.901 --> 00:17.890
<i>How could you lose him?</i>

00:17.969 --> 00:19.834
<i>I just got distracted,
that's all.</i>

00:19.904 --> 00:23.203
You're his friend. Start him
talking about what really happened.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.469
They're on the trail of
the gun? I can't tell you.

00:25.543 --> 00:26.532
Ice Pick's dead.

00:26.611 --> 00:28.545
Ice Pick's not dead.
He's not dead.

02:06.423 --> 02:08.118
Step back!
Step back!

02:08.525 --> 02:10.014
<i>A reflex,</i>

02:10.092 --> 02:12.823
<i>you know, like in basketball, when
everyone's fighting for the rebound.</i>

02:12.896 --> 02:14.488
I know. I'm fine.
I'm okay. Really.

02:14.564 --> 02:16.998
<i>Look, I'm going to have to insist
that you go in and have that looked at.</i>

02:17.067 --> 02:19.297
<i>It's fractured, I just know it.
A hairline fracture. I'm fine.</i>

02:19.436 --> 02:21.461
Riegert... This could
look very bad on my record.

02:21.638 --> 02:23.128
<i>I mean, I'm not supposed to
go around breaking noses...</i>

02:23.206 --> 02:24.434
I'm not going
to file a report...

02:24.508 --> 02:26.066
<i>Mr. Magnum, wait a second.
I'm only worried about you...</i>

02:26.143 --> 02:27.576
It was an accident.
Even the slightest...

02:27.644 --> 02:30.807
<i>In the heat of the moment... Lieutenant,
I got the evidence for you to take...</i>

02:30.881 --> 02:32.109
<i>Hey, get back here...
Ow!</i>

02:32.182 --> 02:33.240
All right. That's it.
You're going in.

02:33.316 --> 02:36.843
<i>Sergeant. Get him into the
ambulance now. No, I'm fine.</i>

02:36.920 --> 02:38.285
<i>Excuse me, excuse me.
All right, I'm going.</i>

02:38.355 --> 02:40.915
<i>Hey, I gotta talk to you. Then it's
gonna have to be in the ambulance.</i>

02:40.991 --> 02:42.151
I'm a little busy right now.
It can't wait.

02:42.225 --> 02:44.056
<i>I'll talk to you when I
get home. Oh, no, you don't.</i>

02:44.194 --> 02:45.183
Excuse me.

02:55.639 --> 02:57.163
The report.

02:58.475 --> 03:01.444
I forgot to have him
sign the report.

03:02.078 --> 03:04.603
I don't believe that guy.
Thank you.

03:04.714 --> 03:06.875
He just banged
right into me. Twice.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.941
Once in the ribs
and once in the nose.

03:09.052 --> 03:11.384
I guess they let anybody into
the police academy these days.

03:12.556 --> 03:16.151
You try getting steamrollered by somebody
who's supposed to be on your side.

03:16.226 --> 03:17.887
What did you
want to talk to me about?

03:19.896 --> 03:21.625
<i>Come on, Rick.
You got something to say.</i>

03:21.831 --> 03:23.059
What's wrong?

03:23.166 --> 03:24.633
I knew something like this
was going to happen.

03:24.701 --> 03:26.498
Something like what?
What's going on?

03:26.603 --> 03:28.195
What did you think
was going to happen?

03:28.305 --> 03:29.738
About what?
You know.

03:29.806 --> 03:31.137
<i>No, I don't know.</i>

03:31.208 --> 03:32.675
About where you get your...

03:33.877 --> 03:36.141
<i>You know, your tip.</i>

03:36.279 --> 03:37.473
What are you talking about?

03:39.082 --> 03:42.483
<i>I knew, I just knew I never should
have helped you in that direction.</i>

03:42.619 --> 03:44.348
Look at all the trouble
that we got into now.

03:44.421 --> 03:46.218
<i>Ice Pick? Are you talking
about... Shh, quiet.</i>

03:46.590 --> 03:49.058
What's the matter with you? Why don't
you just blab it to the whole world?

03:49.292 --> 03:51.692
<i>I mean, haven't you caused
enough damage already?</i>

03:58.768 --> 04:00.736
<i>Back it up a little bit. Yeah, that's good.</i>

04:02.205 --> 04:04.196
<i>Okay, I'll get the doors.</i>

04:06.276 --> 04:07.265
<i>Rick,</i>

04:09.246 --> 04:11.441
<i>is something going on with Ice
Pick? Well, what do you think?</i>

04:11.514 --> 04:13.345
You go around telling everybody
where you get your information.

04:13.416 --> 04:15.646
I didn't tell anybody. Why don't
you just shut up and listen for once?

04:15.719 --> 04:18.244
<i>Marty Shay happens to be the highest
paid hit man on the West Coast,</i>

04:18.321 --> 04:20.983
and it just so happens that he shows up
on the same day you made your big bust.

04:21.057 --> 04:25.187
A bust which you made because of certain
information from a certain friend of mine.

04:25.695 --> 04:26.923
Now he's a marked man.

04:26.997 --> 04:28.123
<i>Let me tell you something,
Thomas,</i>

04:28.198 --> 04:30.689
Marty Shay doesn't give up
until the job is done.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.359
<i>Come on, you're jumping
to all kinds of conclusions.</i>

04:32.435 --> 04:34.426
<i>Yeah, well, do me a favor, just
don't ask for my help anymore.</i>

04:34.504 --> 04:37.405
<i>Rick, wait, come on.
Will you wait a minute?</i>

04:45.548 --> 04:47.914
<i>Okay, sure, Rick was upset.</i>

04:47.984 --> 04:49.042
<i>I could understand that.</i>

04:49.119 --> 04:52.213
<i>I'd probably done the same
thing myself one time or another.</i>

04:52.289 --> 04:55.417
<i>I mean, you misread the
situation, jump to conclusions.</i>

04:55.692 --> 04:56.681
<i>It happens.</i>

04:57.894 --> 04:59.486
<i>The important thing
was to show Rick</i>

04:59.562 --> 05:01.530
<i>that everything
was really all right.</i>

05:01.698 --> 05:05.498
<i>And the best way to do that was
prove that Ice Pick was fine.</i>

05:06.002 --> 05:08.334
<i>Which, I was sure, was the case.</i>

05:08.605 --> 05:12.564
<i>After all, the information he'd given
me in this instance was pretty trivial.</i>

05:12.742 --> 05:15.540
<i>Hardly the kind of stuff
hit men are hired for.</i>

05:15.845 --> 05:19.713
<i>And I was sure Ice Pick was spending
his day like he spent most other days.</i>

05:19.983 --> 05:22.508
<i>Alone in his garden,
tending to his flowers.</i>

05:38.635 --> 05:41.695
The kid is like a son to me.
But when you make a mistake...

05:41.771 --> 05:42.897
You gotta learn.

05:42.972 --> 05:45.702
I told him his finger will mend.

05:46.676 --> 05:48.644
We playing poison?
Yeah.

05:49.079 --> 05:51.445
Could have been worse. Could
have been his arm or his legs.

05:51.548 --> 05:53.209
Or his...
Excuse me?

06:06.329 --> 06:08.627
I'm looking for Ice Pick.
Mr. Hofstetler.

06:12.369 --> 06:13.597
He isn't here.

06:14.270 --> 06:16.738
<i>Well, yeah, I can see that.
Do you know where he is?</i>

06:19.175 --> 06:20.403
<i>Look, I'm a friend.</i>

06:20.977 --> 06:24.777
<i>Well, more like
a friend of a friend.</i>

06:27.917 --> 06:30.351
I didn't mean to interrupt. I
just... I need to talk to him.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.750
It's kind of important.
You can talk to me.

06:33.089 --> 06:34.215
<i>No, this is personal.</i>

06:34.324 --> 06:35.655
He send for you?

06:37.660 --> 06:38.649
Not exactly.

06:42.766 --> 06:45.394
<i>I'll tell you what, I'll
leave him a note in the house.</i>

06:46.002 --> 06:50.268
<i>Hey, what happened
to the other guy?</i>

06:52.909 --> 06:55.173
Would you believe it?
Not a scratch.

07:00.350 --> 07:02.318
You're out. You're dead.

07:02.886 --> 07:04.183
The hell you say.

07:04.354 --> 07:05.343
You're dead.

07:10.059 --> 07:11.720
Hello.
They're outside.

07:11.928 --> 07:14.453
<i>No, I'm looking for Ice Pick.</i>

07:14.531 --> 07:16.396
<i>I'm a friend of his,
Thomas Magnum.</i>

07:16.533 --> 07:17.522
You're not with them?

07:17.834 --> 07:18.858
No.

07:19.803 --> 07:22.397
Sorry. It's just
they're driving me crazy.

07:22.806 --> 07:26.799
I've got better things to do than
baby-sit Ice Pick's houseguests.

07:26.876 --> 07:29.572
Like going over these tax
receipts from fiscal '86.

07:32.649 --> 07:35.174
I'm sorry.
I didn't introduce myself.

07:35.251 --> 07:36.775
Frank Foley.
Hi.

07:36.853 --> 07:38.320
I'm his accountant.

07:40.356 --> 07:41.653
What'll you have?

07:45.328 --> 07:46.386
Nothing.

07:46.463 --> 07:50.058
Do you know when he might be back? Who knows?

07:50.133 --> 07:53.227
<i>He invited all these people here
from New York, Chicago, Florida.</i>

07:53.536 --> 07:54.867
Then he takes a powder.

07:56.506 --> 07:57.768
You walk into a door?

07:59.809 --> 08:01.674
<i>No, it's nothing.</i>

08:03.813 --> 08:05.804
You said you were
a business associate?

08:06.649 --> 08:07.638
A friend.

08:08.017 --> 08:10.451
Do you have any idea
where I could find him?

08:10.887 --> 08:13.219
<i>Listen, if I knew, I'd be there.</i>

08:13.623 --> 08:15.181
<i>If you run into him before I do,</i>

08:15.258 --> 08:17.249
you tell him that
I'm not leaving this house

08:17.327 --> 08:19.352
until I go over every one
of these tax receipts.

08:19.496 --> 08:20.986
<i>Got you, you sucker.</i>

08:21.097 --> 08:23.429
One of these days you'll
learn how to play this game.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.489
I'll tell him.

08:27.570 --> 08:29.401
What do you think
they talk about?

08:35.345 --> 08:37.905
<i>Hey, what is this?</i>

08:38.014 --> 08:39.777
You got three open bottles
behind the bar.

08:39.849 --> 08:41.578
<i>I told you,
open one bottle at a time.</i>

08:41.650 --> 08:43.642
How do you expect me
to keep an accurate inventory

08:43.720 --> 08:44.982
if you're gonna
open a new bottle

08:45.054 --> 08:46.578
for every customer
that asks for a drink!

08:46.656 --> 08:48.590
<i>We were busy,
and I got a little distracted.</i>

08:48.758 --> 08:51.818
<i>Look, Carmella, if you can't handle
the job... It was just a little mistake.</i>

08:51.895 --> 08:53.726
It won't happen again.
Make sure it doesn't.

08:53.796 --> 08:55.263
<i>Hi, Carmella.
Hi, Thomas.</i>

08:55.365 --> 08:57.629
<i>Another fight?
No, not another fight.</i>

08:58.134 --> 09:00.932
<i>Rick,
I went to Ice Pick's house.</i>

09:01.004 --> 09:02.733
Nobody seems to know
where he is.

09:03.406 --> 09:05.067
<i>Rick, did you hear me?</i>

09:05.742 --> 09:07.175
<i>Yeah, I heard you.</i>

09:07.243 --> 09:08.767
<i>Well, have you talked to him?</i>

09:09.012 --> 09:11.606
<i>Thomas, I don't think
that's any of your business.</i>

09:12.048 --> 09:14.516
<i>Oh, come on, Rick,
look, if there's a problem...</i>

09:14.584 --> 09:15.573
There's no problem.

09:15.818 --> 09:18.378
<i>I'm kind of busy around here,
okay? So, I'll see you around.</i>

09:18.521 --> 09:20.011
<i>Come on, Rick,
just listen to me.</i>

09:20.089 --> 09:23.456
The information Ice Pick gave
me was about a burglary ring.

09:23.526 --> 09:26.359
<i>Now even if they knew Ice Pick gave
me the information which they didn't,</i>

09:26.429 --> 09:29.796
<i>and even if they were the kind to put
out a contract on him, which they weren't,</i>

09:29.866 --> 09:31.561
they wouldn't have had time
to do it.

09:31.634 --> 09:33.158
<i>Come on, Rick, you yourself said</i>

09:33.403 --> 09:36.668
that Marty Shay arrived on the
Island before we even made the bust.

09:36.773 --> 09:39.298
<i>Well, I'm glad you got it
all figured out.</i>

09:39.676 --> 09:41.974
Exactly what is the meaning
of this?

09:42.045 --> 09:43.034
<i>Hi, Higgins.</i>

09:43.846 --> 09:45.040
I see you've been
beaten up again.

09:45.114 --> 09:47.014
Exactly what
is the meaning of this?

09:47.116 --> 09:48.378
It looks like a purchase order.

09:48.451 --> 09:50.851
For a very expensive shipment
of imported Margaux

09:50.920 --> 09:52.854
<i>which you were supposed
to pick up three hours ago,</i>

09:53.056 --> 09:55.616
and which has been left to rot
at Honolulu Harbor.

09:56.359 --> 09:57.656
Something came up.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.524
Something came up?

09:59.596 --> 10:00.858
<i>Sorry, gentlemen.</i>

10:01.965 --> 10:03.398
Sorry to bother you like this.

10:03.466 --> 10:05.593
<i>Look, Lieutenant.
I know it was an accident.</i>

10:05.768 --> 10:07.668
<i>I have no intention
of filing a report,</i>

10:07.737 --> 10:09.864
so you can
tell Officer Riegert to relax.

10:09.973 --> 10:12.567
I'm not here for Officer
Riegert. I'm here for Rick.

10:14.243 --> 10:16.711
<i>Sorry, Rick, I'm gonna have
to ask you to come with us.</i>

10:16.779 --> 10:19.748
You're under arrest
for the murder of Marty Shay.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.145
Murder? That's impossible.

10:22.452 --> 10:24.044
<i>You have a right
to remain silent,</i>

10:24.120 --> 10:25.985
<i>but if you give up the right
to remain silent,</i>

10:26.155 --> 10:29.420
<i>anything you say, can and will be
used against you in a court of law.</i>

10:29.492 --> 10:31.790
<i>Lieutenant,
there must be some mistake.</i>

10:32.061 --> 10:34.029
There's no mistake.
I did it.

10:35.965 --> 10:38.365
I killed him.
I killed Marty Shay.

11:09.764 --> 11:11.755
What in the world
happened to your nose?

11:13.101 --> 11:15.160
<i>No, Thomas, no.</i>

11:15.803 --> 11:17.202
And don't even ask.

11:17.272 --> 11:18.534
I didn't come here
to ask for anything.

11:18.606 --> 11:21.700
<i>Oh, yeah, that's the way it always
starts. And then you start talking...</i>

11:21.776 --> 11:25.234
<i>T. C... And then I'm saying,
"No, I really can't do that."</i>

11:25.313 --> 11:27.247
<i>T. C...
And then before you know it,</i>

11:27.382 --> 11:29.043
<i>I'm saying, "All right."</i>

11:29.284 --> 11:32.082
<i>Well, this time,
the answer's, "No."</i>

11:32.754 --> 11:34.415
Are you finished?

11:34.489 --> 11:35.478
No.

11:35.590 --> 11:37.251
I'm not gonna come up
with some excuse

11:37.325 --> 11:38.986
<i>about how I had
a client waiting,</i>

11:39.060 --> 11:40.425
<i>or a date or anything,</i>

11:40.495 --> 11:42.053
<i>because I do, but
that's not the point.</i>

11:42.163 --> 11:43.460
<i>The point is, I don't
have to run off with you</i>

11:43.531 --> 11:46.694
on any of your harebrained
schemes and get my nose like that.

11:46.968 --> 11:49.459
<i>I don't have to justify it,
I don't have to explain it.</i>

11:49.604 --> 11:52.164
All I have to do is say no.

11:53.107 --> 11:54.472
Rick's in jail.

11:54.809 --> 11:56.106
No!

11:56.177 --> 11:58.771
I'm not sure
exactly what happened.

11:58.846 --> 12:00.814
Rick's in jail.
Yeah.

12:01.282 --> 12:03.807
<i>Well, I knew someday
it would come to this.</i>

12:03.918 --> 12:05.510
Now what are you talking about?

12:05.586 --> 12:08.180
<i>I mean, whatever
you would ask him to do,</i>

12:08.423 --> 12:10.084
he would do
without ever thinking

12:10.158 --> 12:11.853
about the consequences
of getting caught.

12:11.959 --> 12:14.393
<i>I mean, it's all right for you to
take risks. That's your business.</i>

12:14.495 --> 12:16.122
He wasn't working for me.

12:16.698 --> 12:17.995
<i>Well, then what?</i>

12:18.700 --> 12:20.327
They said murder.

12:21.135 --> 12:22.124
Murder?

12:22.704 --> 12:25.639
Rick Orville Wright? Mur...
That's crazy.

12:25.740 --> 12:26.729
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

12:26.941 --> 12:28.670
But he said he did it.

12:30.511 --> 12:33.309
<i>I'm gonna go over there and talk
to him, see what I can find out.</i>

12:33.414 --> 12:35.245
I just thought
you'd want to know.

12:38.353 --> 12:41.914
<i>Hey, you're serious, aren't you?</i>

12:57.238 --> 13:01.834
You were terminated from the Admiralty
Club after 10 years of service.

13:03.111 --> 13:04.237
May I ask why?

13:05.413 --> 13:09.110
<i>They weren't open to change.
The board of directors, I mean.</i>

13:09.250 --> 13:10.239
Change?

13:10.651 --> 13:12.915
<i>Oh, the club was like
some kind of throwback</i>

13:12.987 --> 13:14.852
to the days
of the British Empire.

13:14.956 --> 13:16.287
It was stagnating.

13:16.424 --> 13:17.891
You know what I mean.

13:18.059 --> 13:19.754
How can you
attract new membership

13:19.827 --> 13:22.352
with all that discipline
and no imagination?

13:23.431 --> 13:24.420
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

13:24.799 --> 13:26.426
But I guess the final blow came

13:26.567 --> 13:28.660
when I attended the
board of director's meeting

13:28.736 --> 13:31.830
and told them exactly how
anachronistic they all were.

13:32.874 --> 13:36.503
What a remarkable
act of honesty.

13:36.644 --> 13:38.737
And you see what it got me.

13:38.813 --> 13:41.680
I guess most people
just can't stand the truth.

13:43.451 --> 13:44.440
Precisely.

13:47.822 --> 13:49.312
<i>Thank you, Mr. Finch.</i>

13:49.857 --> 13:53.554
<i>Confidentially, you're the
top candidate on my list.</i>

13:53.694 --> 13:56.424
I look forward to your meeting
our board of directors.

13:56.597 --> 13:58.531
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.011
Who was that?

14:11.579 --> 14:15.015
<i>If it's any consolation, your injury
looks a little less ghastly today.</i>

14:15.082 --> 14:16.481
You're hiring a new manager?

14:18.219 --> 14:21.120
The board of directors had an
emergency meeting last night.

14:21.189 --> 14:24.784
They feel it is imperative to find a
replacement for Rick as soon as possible.

14:25.660 --> 14:28.686
I guess they've never heard of the
concept of innocent until proven guilty.

14:28.796 --> 14:32.027
<i>Rick's innocence or guilt is not the
primary issue, at least at the moment.</i>

14:32.200 --> 14:34.691
<i>The fact is, he's in jail.
No one knows for how long.</i>

14:34.769 --> 14:35.758
And I'm sure
that even you could see

14:35.837 --> 14:37.168
that it would be
a trifle difficult

14:37.238 --> 14:39.138
to manage a club
from a jail cell.

14:39.874 --> 14:41.102
Once he's out on bail...

14:41.175 --> 14:43.803
<i>Oh, well, I don't think
he's gonna get out on bail.</i>

14:44.512 --> 14:46.036
He signed a full confession.

14:51.419 --> 14:54.547
A good attorney can convince the
judge that he made it under duress.

14:54.789 --> 14:57.656
<i>And, of course, you can't be
convicted on a confession alone.</i>

14:57.758 --> 14:59.157
He won't hire an attorney.

15:01.696 --> 15:03.220
He's representing himself?

15:03.598 --> 15:07.659
<i>Well, this kid in
the public defender's office,</i>

15:08.503 --> 15:11.563
<i>he seems bright enough
and sincere, but</i>

15:15.810 --> 15:17.368
if he's found guilty...

15:21.182 --> 15:25.414
I suppose we should look
at the remote possibility...

15:26.921 --> 15:29.014
That he's guilty? Rick?

15:29.090 --> 15:30.580
It's hard to say
what people will do

15:30.658 --> 15:32.751
when someone they care about
is threatened.

15:32.827 --> 15:35.523
<i>If you're talking about when his
sister was killed, that's different.</i>

15:35.596 --> 15:37.655
<i>He went off the deep end,
but she was family.</i>

15:37.732 --> 15:38.960
<i>Which is, I believe,</i>

15:39.033 --> 15:41.661
how he characterizes his
relationship with Ice Pick.

15:43.404 --> 15:44.393
Well...

15:45.573 --> 15:49.703
I still don't see why the D.A.'s
office doesn't file formal charges.

15:49.844 --> 15:50.833
They got a full confession.

15:53.948 --> 15:54.937
Unless...

15:56.851 --> 15:59.684
<i>Thanks, Higgins. Good
luck with your interviews.</i>

16:00.922 --> 16:03.254
I believe I've found
the perfect candidate.

16:06.327 --> 16:07.589
<i>Of course,
it's impossible to predict</i>

16:07.662 --> 16:10.825
if the board of directors
will approve my choice.

16:31.819 --> 16:34.583
<i>Hi, your office said
I'd find you here.</i>

16:34.655 --> 16:37.249
<i>Hi, what happened to you?</i>

16:37.425 --> 16:39.893
<i>Oh, that's a long story.
Yes, I'd love to join you.</i>

16:40.127 --> 16:43.688
<i>Oh, Thomas, listen, I'm sorry.
I'm finished and I'm late.</i>

16:44.065 --> 16:45.657
No court dates. I checked.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.130
<i>No, it's a departmental meeting</i>

16:47.201 --> 16:49.567
before the big press
conference this afternoon.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.964
<i>Of course, my boss can't wait to
read about it in the morning paper.</i>

16:53.074 --> 16:56.305
"The D.A.'s Office
Cracks Down On Crime."

16:56.477 --> 16:59.002
<i>A lot of paperwork for us, a
lot of big headlines for him.</i>

17:01.048 --> 17:03.539
Why is it that they're never
around when you need them?

17:06.053 --> 17:07.315
Be right there.

17:07.655 --> 17:09.885
<i>Besides, Thomas, I can't
talk to you. You know that.</i>

17:09.991 --> 17:12.084
What? What do you mean?

17:12.159 --> 17:13.887
<i>Oh, Rick. You can't talk about
Rick's case.</i>

17:13.961 --> 17:15.019
And you know that.

17:15.096 --> 17:17.189
<i>Carol... First of all, I'm
not even assigned to his case</i>

17:17.263 --> 17:18.595
for obvious reasons.
Do you think that I...

17:18.665 --> 17:20.724
<i>And secondly, I can't
tell you anything, anyway.</i>

17:20.800 --> 17:22.928
I know that. I know that.

17:23.436 --> 17:24.699
Can I have some ones please?

17:24.771 --> 17:25.965
Sure.
Thank you.

17:28.676 --> 17:31.167
And you're not going to trick
me into it. I don't want to.

17:31.245 --> 17:33.270
I would never try
and compromise your job.

17:33.781 --> 17:34.770
Well...

17:35.049 --> 17:37.779
<i>I mean, I'm worried about him,
yeah. I'm real worried about Rick.</i>

17:37.852 --> 17:40.150
But I would never put you
in that kind of spot.

17:40.254 --> 17:42.313
We both know how to separate
business and friendship.

17:42.423 --> 17:43.515
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

17:43.591 --> 17:45.081
<i>Anyway, what can you tell me
I don't already know.</i>

17:45.159 --> 17:47.593
<i>Besides his confession, I know
you've got Rick's fingerprints,</i>

17:47.662 --> 17:49.095
<i>hair samples,</i>

17:49.930 --> 17:52.558
<i>witnesses placing him at the
scene, that sort of stuff.</i>

17:53.367 --> 17:54.925
<i>No, you don't know that.</i>

17:55.269 --> 17:56.998
<i>You just want me
to say, "Yes" or "No,"</i>

17:57.071 --> 17:59.437
<i>and then you'll have the
information. Well, forget it, Thomas.</i>

17:59.507 --> 18:02.067
<i>Carol, I went to the apartment
where Shay was murdered.</i>

18:02.143 --> 18:03.701
I talked to the officer on duty.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.008
He gave me a rundown of
the evidence. Yeah. Oh.

18:06.881 --> 18:08.348
<i>I also know you don't have
a murder weapon,</i>

18:08.416 --> 18:10.316
otherwise you would have
filed murder one charges.

18:10.484 --> 18:11.917
<i>Listen, with this new
get-tough policy,</i>

18:11.986 --> 18:14.614
they're gonna file murder one
even if they don't find it.

18:20.995 --> 18:22.326
You were guessing this time.

18:22.396 --> 18:23.556
You didn't know about the gun.

18:23.798 --> 18:24.924
<i>You mean, no gun, don't you?</i>

18:24.999 --> 18:26.557
<i>I mean, that you tricked me.</i>

18:26.634 --> 18:27.862
<i>Well, I'm sorry, but I had to.</i>

18:27.935 --> 18:29.994
And how does it feel?
You do it to me all the time.

18:30.071 --> 18:31.698
<i>Besides, if they don't have
a murder weapon,</i>

18:31.772 --> 18:34.866
that means the charges could be
reduced to manslaughter or something.

18:34.942 --> 18:37.035
Just don't be so sure you
know what you think you know.

18:37.111 --> 18:39.011
What does that mean?
I can't tell you.

18:40.381 --> 18:42.747
They're on the trail of
the gun? I can't tell you!

18:51.859 --> 18:54.020
<i>I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.</i>

18:54.161 --> 18:56.152
<i>Carol hadn't really
told me anything.</i>

18:56.297 --> 18:59.824
<i>But maybe what she hadn't
told me was what was important.</i>

18:59.900 --> 19:03.165
<i>She hadn't told me
that the gun had been found.</i>

19:03.237 --> 19:05.205
<i>Now, I didn't expect
that it would be,</i>

19:05.406 --> 19:06.737
<i>but on the other hand,</i>

19:06.874 --> 19:09.707
<i>if anybody was going to go to
Rick's house to look for it,</i>

19:09.844 --> 19:11.744
<i>maybe that somebody
ought to be me.</i>

19:17.918 --> 19:19.249
What brings you here?

19:19.420 --> 19:23.550
The D.A. Intends to show that Rick used
three weapons to gun down Marty Shay?

19:23.624 --> 19:25.148
<i>Yeah, I know
how you feel about Rick,</i>

19:25.226 --> 19:26.454
but I got to play it
by the book.

19:26.594 --> 19:28.255
I've have a search warrant
for the murder weapon.

19:28.329 --> 19:30.320
He wasn't killed
with an AK-47.

19:30.464 --> 19:32.523
<i>Whatever's relevant to
the case, I got to take in.</i>

19:32.666 --> 19:34.861
<i>Come on, Lieutenant. Rick's
a collector. You know that.</i>

19:34.935 --> 19:36.425
He brought those back
from Vietnam.

19:36.504 --> 19:39.564
<i>But if you take them in, some
people could get the wrong idea.</i>

19:40.040 --> 19:43.168
<i>Sorry, Magnum,
there's nothing I can do now.</i>

19:43.377 --> 19:46.312
You're his friend. Maybe you
can get him to listen to reason.

19:46.547 --> 19:48.811
Start him talking about
what really happened.

19:56.357 --> 19:58.257
They can't introduce
the weapons into evidence

19:58.325 --> 20:00.020
since they have
no bearing on the case.

20:00.394 --> 20:03.454
<i>So, I think we plead guilty and
stand firm on our self-defense route.</i>

20:03.564 --> 20:05.657
Self defense?
Who's gonna buy self defense?

20:05.766 --> 20:08.166
<i>Let him talk, will you?
Anybody see him attack you?</i>

20:08.269 --> 20:09.668
<i>Well, they don't
have to be witnesses...</i>

20:09.737 --> 20:11.034
Anybody hear him threaten you?

20:11.105 --> 20:13.471
<i>The burden of proof, of
course... Just shut up a minute.</i>

20:13.607 --> 20:16.098
<i>Hey, wait a minute. The guy's
just trying to do his job.</i>

20:16.243 --> 20:18.006
<i>With four witnesses
who saw you go in,</i>

20:18.078 --> 20:19.545
<i>three who saw you go out,</i>

20:19.613 --> 20:21.843
<i>fingerprints all over the place, you leave,</i>

20:21.949 --> 20:22.938
<i>you throw your gun in the ocean,</i>

20:23.017 --> 20:24.678
and wait for the cops
to come and pick you up.

20:24.752 --> 20:26.777
<i>And when they do, you confess.
That's your story?</i>

20:26.887 --> 20:30.050
It could've happened. And don't tell
me you were momentarily confused.

20:30.124 --> 20:33.685
<i>Just explain to me how you kept
your head in three tours in Vietnam,</i>

20:33.761 --> 20:34.989
<i>got us through Bin Loc,</i>

20:35.062 --> 20:38.896
and then got somehow momentarily
confused into confessing murder.

20:38.966 --> 20:42.527
Or don't you think the prosecution's
smart enough to bring any of that up?

20:59.520 --> 21:02.512
<i>Hey, don't take it serious.
He's just worried about you.</i>

21:04.291 --> 21:06.259
It's just the way he is.
You know that.

21:09.697 --> 21:11.790
How did you get that mouse?

21:12.900 --> 21:14.333
It's a long story.

21:19.073 --> 21:21.769
Anything I can get you?
Some magazines?

21:22.276 --> 21:23.834
Anybody you want me to call?

21:25.145 --> 21:26.134
<i>T. C.,</i>

21:30.484 --> 21:32.452
I ever tell you
about my kid sister?

21:36.190 --> 21:39.057
<i>He wasn't making much sense,
at least I thought he wasn't.</i>

21:39.326 --> 21:42.352
He was kind of rambling on
about what a good kid she was.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.989
<i>How she joined all the clubs,
never missed a day at school,</i>

21:46.233 --> 21:50.226
<i>then he got to the part about
him stealing from the petty cash,</i>

21:50.437 --> 21:52.166
taking money
from the bake sale...

21:52.239 --> 21:54.730
<i>Yeah, Wendy would cover for
him because with his record,</i>

21:54.808 --> 21:57.504
they'd pack him off to
reform school until he was 25.

21:57.611 --> 21:59.272
Almost verbatim.

21:59.346 --> 22:00.973
Just like sending
Ice Pick to prison

22:01.048 --> 22:02.913
would be the same
as a death sentence.

22:03.284 --> 22:05.149
<i>Yeah, even though
I'm not a big fan of his,</i>

22:05.219 --> 22:07.312
I still don't think
Ice Pick killed the guy.

22:07.388 --> 22:09.686
<i>Well, whether he did or not,
Rick believes it.</i>

22:09.857 --> 22:12.417
<i>Look, maybe he witnessed it,
I don't know...</i>

22:12.493 --> 22:14.085
<i>We've got to find him, T.C.</i>

22:14.628 --> 22:16.391
Maybe he's at his condo in Maui.

22:16.697 --> 22:18.324
His condo

22:18.632 --> 22:20.532
with the unlisted phone number.

22:20.834 --> 22:22.233
I'll be airborne in 20 minutes.

22:22.336 --> 22:23.963
I'm gonna go back
and talk to his accountant.

22:24.071 --> 22:26.665
Maybe he knows more
than he's letting on.

22:27.207 --> 22:28.640
I'll call you from Maui.

22:28.709 --> 22:30.108
You think I was too hard on him?

22:30.844 --> 22:33.278
<i>Yeah, but you did
what had to be done.</i>

22:33.447 --> 22:35.347
<i>Well, next time
I get to play good cop.</i>

22:46.126 --> 22:49.323
<i>To tell you the truth,
I'm kind of glad you came back.</i>

22:51.432 --> 22:53.866
I don't know
who I should talk to.

22:54.702 --> 22:57.034
Maybe I should have
trusted you yesterday.

22:59.573 --> 23:01.473
Ice Pick is in trouble.

23:01.942 --> 23:03.500
The guys
who were here yesterday?

23:03.644 --> 23:05.703
<i>No, no, no...
Those guys were his friends.</i>

23:06.914 --> 23:08.677
Maybe I should tell you
the whole thing.

23:08.782 --> 23:11.478
There are some people that want
to set up some operation that.

23:12.186 --> 23:14.654
Ice Pick didn't want to get started here.

23:14.822 --> 23:16.881
There were some threats
made on his life.

23:16.957 --> 23:18.288
<i>I mean,
nothing that he took serious.</i>

23:18.359 --> 23:20.589
<i>You know, I asked him
to go to the police.</i>

23:20.661 --> 23:22.993
<i>Anyway, that's why
he invited his friends in</i>

23:23.063 --> 23:24.792
to help dissuade
this other party.

23:24.965 --> 23:26.227
Then he disappears.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.934
<i>I mean, I haven't seen him
since I talked to you yesterday.</i>

23:31.338 --> 23:33.772
<i>And if anything's
happened to him,</i>

23:34.908 --> 23:38.002
These guys can just move in.

23:38.445 --> 23:41.209
Who are these guys?

23:42.149 --> 23:43.548
<i>I'm just his accountant,
Mr. Magnum.</i>

23:43.617 --> 23:46.484
<i>I mean, you know, he doesn't
tell me all the details.</i>

23:48.422 --> 23:49.912
Do you think
we should call the police?

23:50.591 --> 23:53.788
<i>Mr. Foley, excuse me,</i>

23:54.194 --> 23:55.786
this was delivered to you.

23:56.864 --> 23:57.853
Thank you.

24:20.154 --> 24:21.143
It's Ice Pick.

24:28.610 --> 24:30.100
<i>When I was seven years old,</i>

24:30.178 --> 24:33.409
<i>I hit my first baseball
through my first window.</i>

24:33.582 --> 24:35.914
<i>Actually,
it was my neighbor's window.</i>

24:35.984 --> 24:38.350
<i>The neighborhood crank,
Mr. Dreeson.</i>

24:38.420 --> 24:41.981
<i>Now, I knew my grandfather would explain
it to him and get me out of the jam.</i>

24:42.190 --> 24:43.384
<i>But he didn't.</i>

24:43.492 --> 24:45.357
<i>He told me
this was a good opportunity</i>

24:45.427 --> 24:48.487
<i>to learn how to tell somebody
something you didn't want to.</i>

24:48.630 --> 24:51.360
<i>That I'd have to learn how
to do that sooner or later.</i>

24:51.566 --> 24:55.297
<i>And that if I just told the truth,
Mr. Dreeson would understand.</i>

24:55.370 --> 24:57.895
<i>Mr. Dreeson
screamed at me for 20 minutes.</i>

25:03.445 --> 25:05.936
<i>Hey, Thomas, you been
reading about Sid Fernandez?</i>

25:06.014 --> 25:07.174
No. He did even better in spring training

25:07.249 --> 25:09.410
than he did in the Series.
Everybody's watching.

25:09.484 --> 25:10.473
<i>Rick...
You know,</i>

25:10.552 --> 25:13.112
<i>it makes you feel proud,
huh? Local boy makes good.</i>

25:13.188 --> 25:15.156
The guys here look up
to him. That's important.

25:15.223 --> 25:16.212
<i>Sit down.</i>

25:17.526 --> 25:18.515
Rick...

25:18.660 --> 25:21.254
<i>Hey, look, Thomas,
don't get me wrong.</i>

25:21.863 --> 25:23.763
I appreciate everything you've
been trying to do for me.

25:23.832 --> 25:25.129
But I don't want your help.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.428
<i>I mean,
it ain't too good in here,</i>

25:27.536 --> 25:29.401
<i>but it ain't
the end of the world, either.</i>

25:29.471 --> 25:31.769
<i>The chow ain't too great,
either, but compared to...</i>

25:31.840 --> 25:32.864
<i>Rick, there's something important I mean,</i>

25:32.941 --> 25:35.603
<i>I've got to tell you. We've been through
worse, right? Nothing lasts forever.</i>

25:35.677 --> 25:36.803
Ice Pick's dead.

25:41.783 --> 25:43.683
I think you better quit
coming to see me.

25:43.919 --> 25:46.387
<i>Damn it, Rick, Ice Pick's dead.</i>

25:46.722 --> 25:47.950
I don't believe you.

25:48.457 --> 25:49.446
All right.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.950
<i>This was delivered to Frank
Foley, Ice Pick's accountant.</i>

25:53.128 --> 25:55.562
Foley doesn't know spit. He's
nothing but Ice Pick's money man.

25:55.630 --> 25:56.892
Foley's already gone
to the police.

25:56.965 --> 25:59.160
You don't have to protect
Ice Pick anymore.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.861
Who says I was?
You did.

26:03.071 --> 26:05.062
<i>When you told T.C. That story
about your sister,</i>

26:05.173 --> 26:06.606
you as much as admitted it.

26:06.842 --> 26:08.002
You'd do anything

26:08.076 --> 26:09.805
<i>to get me to say what you
want to hear, wouldn't you?</i>

26:09.878 --> 26:12.745
Anything at all to get me.
Even phony-up a photo.

26:12.814 --> 26:15.681
<i>Don't you think I know how they
do that? Rick, this isn't a trick.</i>

26:16.151 --> 26:17.448
I don't believe you.

26:17.853 --> 26:19.718
Ice Pick's not dead.
He's not dead.

26:20.155 --> 26:21.144
Rick.
Guard.

26:22.257 --> 26:25.021
Open up.
Open the door. Guard!

26:25.093 --> 26:27.152
<i>Rick. Damn it, I'm not listening to you.</i>

26:27.462 --> 26:30.295
<i>Open the door!
Damn it, open the door!</i>

26:30.365 --> 26:31.354
Guard!

26:33.435 --> 26:36.461
<i>Boy, I'll tell you. This job could
not have come at a better time.</i>

26:36.571 --> 26:40.234
<i>Even this morning, my roommate
threatens to kick me out,</i>

26:40.308 --> 26:42.708
if I don't come up
with the grocery money.

26:43.445 --> 26:44.844
Do you believe
the nerve of that guy?

26:44.913 --> 26:49.179
<i>Well, naturally, any final decision
will rest with the board of directors.</i>

26:49.284 --> 26:50.273
All guys?

26:50.852 --> 26:51.841
<i>Well, yes...</i>

26:52.354 --> 26:53.878
Kind of old guys?

26:54.356 --> 26:55.721
Mature men. Yes.

26:56.091 --> 26:58.457
That's good. That's good. You
don't have anything to worry about.

26:58.593 --> 27:01.619
<i>I've got this, kind of, I don't
know what, effect on old guys.</i>

27:01.696 --> 27:03.220
You know?

27:03.298 --> 27:05.357
I'm quite certain
you'll have an effect on them.

27:05.434 --> 27:08.631
<i>Yeah, I don't know what it is. I think I
remind them of their daughters or something.</i>

27:09.738 --> 27:13.174
Have you any experience at all
in club management?

27:14.009 --> 27:17.342
I was a night cashier at the Taco
House downtown for six months.

27:17.412 --> 27:19.380
The night cashier?
Yeah.

27:19.614 --> 27:21.548
Have you ever eaten
at the Taco House?

27:21.817 --> 27:23.148
<i>No, not that I recall.</i>

27:23.485 --> 27:26.010
<i>Boy, you ought to be there
on a Saturday night.</i>

27:26.154 --> 27:28.714
The people we get in.

27:28.957 --> 27:31.448
<i>I imagine it's the same sort
of thing around here, you know.</i>

27:31.660 --> 27:35.289
<i>People out looking to have a good
time, drinking a little too much.</i>

27:35.397 --> 27:38.423
And some guy makes a pass
at the wrong guy's wife

27:38.500 --> 27:41.901
then you're in a fight and you
gotta take out the seltzer water.

27:41.970 --> 27:42.959
Seltzer water?

27:43.138 --> 27:45.072
<i>You know,
the water in those tin cans.</i>

27:45.140 --> 27:46.129
I'll tell you something.

27:46.208 --> 27:48.904
It works just as good
on humans as it does on dogs.

27:48.977 --> 27:51.172
<i>Indeed.
Yeah, absolutely.</i>

27:51.246 --> 27:53.009
<i>You just take that
little nozzle, you know,</i>

27:53.248 --> 27:56.775
and you aim it
in a very strategic area.

27:58.753 --> 28:00.243
Works every time.

28:00.355 --> 28:03.586
I learned that from an ex-boyfriend
of mine. He was in the Navy.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.149
I see.

28:06.261 --> 28:08.354
<i>Boy, you always come away
with something, don't you?</i>

28:08.497 --> 28:11.295
<i>You know, I mean even if you
hate the guy when you break up</i>

28:11.366 --> 28:15.325
<i>and then suddenly you think,
I learned that seltzer trick.</i>

28:15.403 --> 28:16.768
It wasn't such a total waste.

28:17.105 --> 28:18.629
<i>Yes, I see your point.</i>

28:18.974 --> 28:20.236
<i>So, when do I start?</i>

28:22.277 --> 28:24.245
<i>Well, actually,
there is one other candidate.</i>

28:24.813 --> 28:26.804
A guy.
As it happens.

28:27.349 --> 28:28.941
I knew it. I just...

28:29.017 --> 28:30.507
What is it with guys?
They get all the luck.

28:30.585 --> 28:31.745
<i>You know,
I don't think that's...</i>

28:31.820 --> 28:32.878
<i>As I was about to say,</i>

28:32.954 --> 28:36.446
<i>there was one other candidate, who up
until this moment was the top contender.</i>

28:37.259 --> 28:38.248
He's a boxer?

28:38.560 --> 28:39.822
What? No.

28:39.995 --> 28:41.121
<i>Look, if you're
looking for someone</i>

28:41.196 --> 28:43.187
<i>to be a bouncer, too
and a manager,</i>

28:43.298 --> 28:44.788
you gotta pay me
two salaries 'cause...

28:45.000 --> 28:47.594
<i>If I could finish...
Yeah, sure, go ahead.</i>

28:48.003 --> 28:49.027
Where was I?

28:49.171 --> 28:51.901
You were talking about the guy
who was a top contender.

28:52.274 --> 28:53.263
Quite.

28:53.375 --> 28:58.005
<i>After our interview today, I feel that you
are clearly the more qualified applicant.</i>

29:00.782 --> 29:02.443
All right.

29:02.717 --> 29:05.151
I will arrange for a meeting
of our board of directors

29:05.220 --> 29:07.415
<i>at 10:00 a. M.,
tomorrow morning.</i>

29:09.291 --> 29:11.088
<i>Well, I'll be there.</i>

29:12.994 --> 29:13.983
Look...

29:14.729 --> 29:16.424
Look if you're ever
not doing anything

29:16.531 --> 29:18.931
<i>on a Saturday night or something, call me up.</i>

29:20.502 --> 29:22.663
<i>We'll go to the Taco House,
my treat.</i>

29:23.171 --> 29:24.968
That's great.

29:26.541 --> 29:27.530
Bye.

29:28.443 --> 29:30.274
<i>Ah, good for you.</i>

29:30.345 --> 29:32.210
That's great. All right.

29:32.614 --> 29:33.603
I'll talk to you.

29:42.190 --> 29:44.784
Are you beginning to think he did it? No.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.651
<i>If not for protection,
maybe for revenge.</i>

29:47.729 --> 29:49.993
<i>You mean, knowing Ice Pick
was already dead?</i>

29:50.065 --> 29:51.054
I'm just asking.

29:51.333 --> 29:52.664
Is that what the D.A.
Is going to say?

29:52.734 --> 29:56.170
<i>Thomas, I shouldn't even be seen talking to
you. Okay, I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.</i>

29:56.238 --> 29:58.672
It's just I can't figure out why he's
holding onto that ridiculous story.

29:59.608 --> 30:02.042
Maybe he doesn't really
believe Ice Pick is dead.

30:02.210 --> 30:04.701
<i>Well, then he's never
gonna tell me the truth.</i>

30:04.779 --> 30:06.246
Maybe you should
quit asking him.

30:06.314 --> 30:08.111
<i>You mean, stop trying
to get him out of jail?</i>

30:08.216 --> 30:09.205
No.

30:09.751 --> 30:12.151
Just turn your focus
into another direction.

30:12.487 --> 30:13.647
Maybe talk
to Ice Pick's friends.

30:13.722 --> 30:14.882
The guys who came in
from the Mainland.

30:14.990 --> 30:17.117
<i>Well, they're already gone.
Walter Pigeon.</i>

30:19.194 --> 30:20.183
What?

30:27.469 --> 30:29.699
<i>A cogent note
about Walter Pigeon.</i>

30:29.771 --> 30:32.899
<i>Not the actor.
My Cousin Raney's pet bird.</i>

30:33.241 --> 30:35.835
<i>One summer, Walter got out
of the house onto the deck.</i>

30:36.077 --> 30:37.066
<i>He would've flown away,</i>

30:37.145 --> 30:39.579
<i>except there was a glass
partition he couldn't get through.</i>

30:39.714 --> 30:43.775
<i>He kept trying and trying, but he
kept hitting up against the glass.</i>

30:44.786 --> 30:47.949
<i>Now, two feet to the left and two
feet to the right, the partition ended.</i>

30:48.256 --> 30:49.780
<i>But he couldn't see the obvious.</i>

30:49.958 --> 30:52.688
<i>That there was a glass wall
in front of him.</i>

30:53.094 --> 30:56.188
<i>The difference between me
and Walter Pigeon was,</i>

30:56.464 --> 31:00.025
<i>I had finally seen the wall that Frank
Foley had thrown up in front of me.</i>

31:00.168 --> 31:03.331
<i>And I was taking two steps
to the left to get around it.</i>

31:08.443 --> 31:11.935
<i>The test results for
gunpowder traces on your hands</i>

31:12.013 --> 31:16.279
and the ballistics tests on
your guns came back negative.

31:16.851 --> 31:18.113
We're in good shape.

31:18.286 --> 31:20.345
The gunpowder test
doesn't mean anything.

31:20.488 --> 31:23.321
I washed my hands
when I was in Shay's room.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.454
You're not giving me
much help here.

31:29.130 --> 31:31.030
I'm not going to put you
on the stand.

31:31.266 --> 31:34.724
<i>If you want to sell yourself down
the river, that's your business.</i>

31:34.803 --> 31:37.431
But I'm going to conduct
the best case I know how.

31:43.645 --> 31:44.634
Guard.

31:45.814 --> 31:46.803
Guard.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.515
<i>Your attorney, I presume?</i>

31:58.960 --> 31:59.949
<i>Hi, Higgins.</i>

32:01.596 --> 32:03.427
You can set your mind at rest.

32:03.698 --> 32:06.462
I have retained the services of one
of Mr. Masters' finest attorneys.

32:06.868 --> 32:08.995
<i>I don't think so, Higgins.
But thanks anyway.</i>

32:09.838 --> 32:12.329
<i>If it's the money that concerns
you, I have worked out a plan...</i>

32:12.774 --> 32:15.902
It's not the money. I don't
need your fancy lawyer.

32:17.278 --> 32:18.267
<i>Rick,</i>

32:18.680 --> 32:22.047
<i>that young man was undoubtedly
a fine law student last year,</i>

32:22.183 --> 32:23.912
<i>but if you'll forgive
my saying so,</i>

32:24.119 --> 32:26.849
you're going to need a lot
more than youthful enthusiasm

32:26.921 --> 32:28.786
if you're going
to win this case.

32:29.023 --> 32:30.012
No.

32:31.459 --> 32:32.790
<i>I said, no.</i>

34:09.090 --> 34:10.681
<i>Hello, Frank.</i>

34:10.824 --> 34:11.813
Mr. Magnum.

34:12.893 --> 34:14.020
What a surprise to see you here.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.222
You're on your way
to the police station?

34:16.831 --> 34:19.994
<i>Yeah, I was just going to but...
Something important came up?</i>

34:20.268 --> 34:22.532
<i>It wasn't that important really,
but I thought I'd take care of it.</i>

34:22.603 --> 34:24.469
<i>You know, I just heard
the funniest thing.</i>

34:24.539 --> 34:26.097
You forgot to mention to me

34:26.174 --> 34:29.041
that Ice Pick signed over power
of attorney to you last week.

34:29.844 --> 34:32.005
<i>Well, I don't see what that
has to do with anything.</i>

34:32.146 --> 34:34.580
I don't suppose you were withdrawing
money from Ice Pick's account.

34:34.681 --> 34:35.670
Magnum.

34:36.484 --> 34:37.712
Hold it right there.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.911
I've been chasing you all over
town. I need you to sign the report.

34:39.987 --> 34:41.717
Riegert...
Will you come back here?

34:41.789 --> 34:42.777
Not now.

34:50.598 --> 34:51.587
Let go of me!

34:54.668 --> 34:55.658
Help!

34:55.837 --> 34:57.304
Freeze! Police!

34:59.574 --> 35:00.734
My dress.

35:06.848 --> 35:08.475
<i>Here you are, ma'am.
Thank you.</i>

35:09.984 --> 35:11.474
<i>Don't worry, Mr. Magnum.</i>

35:12.120 --> 35:15.089
We'll find that guy for you.
Whoever he is.

35:15.189 --> 35:18.124
<i>Riegert, please,
don't do me any more favors.</i>

35:20.762 --> 35:22.593
<i>There's no way
we're gonna find this guy now.</i>

35:24.632 --> 35:26.793
<i>A black car with a skirt
hanging out the back...</i>

35:26.868 --> 35:28.699
<i>I know it's a long shot but...</i>

35:28.836 --> 35:30.201
<i>How could you lose him?</i>

35:30.271 --> 35:33.035
<i>I just got distracted,
that's all.</i>

35:34.309 --> 35:38.177
<i>I'm going to circle back. Maybe we
could find something on the leeward side.</i>

35:39.714 --> 35:40.703
<i>No wait.</i>

35:48.256 --> 35:49.245
<i>Look.</i>

35:49.924 --> 35:51.482
<i>Hold the stick.</i>

36:05.573 --> 36:09.407
<i>Just good, old fashioned
investigative technique.</i>

36:12.146 --> 36:14.808
<i>Maybe you could find a place
to set us down.</i>

37:47.041 --> 37:48.030
Yeah.

37:49.844 --> 37:50.833
<i>Well, now what?</i>

37:52.246 --> 37:53.736
We go in and have a talk.

37:54.348 --> 37:55.872
<i>Somehow,
I don't think those guys</i>

37:55.950 --> 37:57.645
are gonna be too thrilled
to see us.

38:05.593 --> 38:06.924
Wait a minute.

38:16.404 --> 38:17.769
He's alive.

38:17.839 --> 38:19.238
Ice Pick's alive.

38:24.277 --> 38:27.644
<i>One last thought about Walter
Pigeon and the glass wall.</i>

38:28.214 --> 38:30.341
<i>I'd always wondered
what would have happened</i>

38:30.416 --> 38:32.714
<i>if old Walter had gone
around the glass partition</i>

38:32.819 --> 38:34.013
<i>and found his freedom.</i>

38:34.387 --> 38:35.718
<i>What would he have done with it?</i>

38:35.922 --> 38:39.824
<i>Maybe it was better that he never
knew what was beyond the wall.</i>

38:39.959 --> 38:41.859
<i>I hope you get to him
before I do, T.M.</i>

38:41.928 --> 38:43.555
I just might kill him for real.

38:43.629 --> 38:47.087
First get him to tell you why he's
letting Rick take the fall for him.

38:47.233 --> 38:49.827
<i>It's just not like him, T.C.
Rick's like a son to him.</i>

38:49.936 --> 38:51.870
<i>Well, maybe Ice Pick
changed his mind.</i>

38:52.038 --> 38:53.027
Maybe.

38:54.407 --> 38:55.772
I guess we'll find out.

38:56.008 --> 38:58.476
<i>Yeah, sure. Right after
we get past his troops.</i>

38:58.711 --> 39:02.010
<i>Well, look, besides Foley,
there's only two of them.</i>

39:03.983 --> 39:05.473
Only two that you know of.

39:05.785 --> 39:07.946
<i>Well, they don't know about
us. That makes a difference.</i>

39:08.020 --> 39:09.988
<i>Yeah, that's easy for
you to say. You got a gun.</i>

39:10.056 --> 39:11.455
I don't have a gun.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.291
You don't have your gun?

40:30.970 --> 40:32.460
Sweet dreams.

40:52.491 --> 40:53.480
Magnum?

40:55.528 --> 40:58.588
How long did you plan on hiding
out here? Just till after the trial?

41:00.032 --> 41:01.192
How did you find me?

41:01.267 --> 41:02.700
Did you tell Rick
what you were doing

41:02.768 --> 41:05.566
or did you just let him go to
jail without even knowing why.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.769
<i>Ricky's in jail?
Come on, Ice Pick.</i>

41:08.841 --> 41:11.309
<i>You going to tell me you don't know
anything about the photograph, either?</i>

41:11.377 --> 41:12.708
The proof that you're dead.

41:13.245 --> 41:14.769
<i>Well, that was Frank's idea.</i>

41:15.448 --> 41:18.576
To throw the guys who hired
that hit man off the track.

41:18.818 --> 41:21.480
<i>It's just for a little while,
till things calm down.</i>

41:21.654 --> 41:25.146
<i>In the meantime, Rick goes to
jail for the murder of Marty Shay?</i>

41:25.524 --> 41:26.513
No.

41:26.592 --> 41:27.581
That's wrong.

41:28.628 --> 41:29.993
Frank didn't tell me.

41:31.964 --> 41:33.124
<i>Well, we can fix that.</i>

41:33.332 --> 41:35.732
All you gotta do is come
and talk to some people.

41:35.801 --> 41:38.133
<i>Well, I'm not sure
I can do that.</i>

41:41.007 --> 41:42.941
If Frank's doing this
on his own...

41:47.947 --> 41:48.936
Frank! No!

42:27.086 --> 42:28.417
You all right?

42:28.654 --> 42:30.315
I... I didn't know.

42:45.838 --> 42:48.466
Why did you do it?
After 18 years?

42:48.874 --> 42:50.341
Why did you sell me out?

42:52.812 --> 42:54.177
I didn't mean to.

42:56.849 --> 42:58.544
I only meant to protect you.

43:01.921 --> 43:04.355
But they offered me
so much money.

43:07.626 --> 43:08.991
I'm sorry.

43:09.895 --> 43:10.884
Very sorry.

43:13.733 --> 43:15.860
I'll go call an ambulance.

43:20.339 --> 43:22.307
We'd better go see about Rick.

43:26.011 --> 43:27.911
<i>Okay, so it wasn't
a very smart move. But...</i>

43:27.980 --> 43:30.710
I didn't say
it wasn't a very smart move.

43:31.016 --> 43:33.348
I said it was
a very stupid move.

43:33.719 --> 43:36.882
Walking into Shay's room when
you could see he was dead.

43:37.456 --> 43:39.390
It was a very stupid move.

43:39.658 --> 43:40.920
But I didn't know
what else to do.

43:40.993 --> 43:42.961
<i>Look, I couldn't let them
lock you up. I was sure...</i>

43:43.062 --> 43:44.791
<i>Hurry up!
I was sure, you know...</i>

43:44.864 --> 43:45.853
<i>Even if I had,</i>

43:47.466 --> 43:49.229
nobody takes the fall for me.

43:49.735 --> 43:50.997
You understand?

43:52.338 --> 43:53.771
<i>Yeah, I understand.</i>

43:53.873 --> 43:54.862
Good.

43:54.974 --> 43:57.602
Wipe that thousand-yard stare
off your puss.

43:58.477 --> 44:01.071
<i>Come on,
you're walking out of here.</i>

44:02.782 --> 44:03.771
Huh?

44:04.784 --> 44:06.308
<i>He's right, Orville.</i>

44:07.253 --> 44:08.584
You've been released.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.880
Ballistics proved that
Foley's gun killed Marty Shay.

44:12.324 --> 44:14.417
They've got him in custody.
You're free.

44:15.127 --> 44:16.458
We beat it?
We beat it.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.998
<i>I've got some paperwork to do, but in a
couple of hours, I'll have you out of here.</i>

44:21.133 --> 44:22.191
Damn!

44:22.968 --> 44:25.368
I'm free! We did it!
We beat it!

44:26.005 --> 44:27.734
<i>Thanks, Ice Pick, thanks!</i>

44:27.807 --> 44:28.899
And thank you.

44:28.974 --> 44:31.272
<i>Baby get the key, 'cause
we're getting out of here.</i>

44:31.377 --> 44:32.366
We beat it!

44:34.280 --> 44:36.646
Wow! We beat it!

44:37.383 --> 44:39.943
<i>Man, I can't believe the Board
hasn't replaced me already.</i>

44:40.019 --> 44:41.008
You know
how conservative they are.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.246
<i>Yes, well, sometimes the right
candidate just doesn't appear.</i>

44:44.356 --> 44:45.983
No matter how hard you look? Quite.

44:47.326 --> 44:48.486
<i>Higgie, baby,</i>

44:48.561 --> 44:51.359
you didn't do something
underhanded and sneaky

44:51.430 --> 44:54.058
like screen out
all the good candidates?

44:54.133 --> 44:56.499
Certainly not. I would never
compromise the Board's standards.

44:57.303 --> 44:59.430
What's the difference?
It's all behind us now.

45:01.473 --> 45:02.462
Rick?

45:03.242 --> 45:04.231
Hey.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.845
I'm sorry about this.
I really am.

45:09.381 --> 45:11.611
This is Federal Agent McCartt. Gentlemen.

45:11.884 --> 45:13.545
He has a warrant
for your arrest.

45:13.619 --> 45:18.283
<i>Section 6861 D,
possession of illegal weapons.</i>

45:18.557 --> 45:22.584
<i>Section 5861S, altering weapons.</i>

45:22.661 --> 45:25.630
Each carrying a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison.
