01:14.560 --> 01:15.840
but would you mind
if I went tonight instead?

01:15.840 --> 01:20.000

really like to tell the story.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.040
Cody was a talented girl
with a real passion for art.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.200
But like with all artists,

02:31.200 --> 02:35.280
sometimes inspiration was
hard to come by.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.080
I knew I'd find you here.

What's wrong?

Lucas,
what do you see over there?

02:51.280 --> 02:52.320
A tree.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.920
Exactly.
That's what I see too.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.440
Wait.
You lost me.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.360
Okay,
if you want to create art--

03:01.360 --> 03:04.440
I mean, the kind of art
that moves someone--

03:04.440 --> 03:06.680
then you have to see more
than what's obvious.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.160
You have to become a part
of what you're drawing,

03:10.160 --> 03:13.920
or it's just gonna be lines
on paper.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.840
I know how to make lines.

03:16.840 --> 03:21.200

know how to draw.

Absolutely.

is too thick.

only one brush.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.080
You should come with me.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.640
I want you to meet someone.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.320
It's the brushes.

21:14.720 --> 21:15.480
[Screams]

21:15.480 --> 21:19.480
Become a hunter for me,

21:19.480 --> 21:20.320
and live forever.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.720
[Laughing]

21:31.720 --> 21:34.840
I think you'll like him.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.880
Lucas!
It's the brushes.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.960
They trap people
inside paintings.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.840
[Laughs]

21:47.240 --> 21:53.360
You tread on dangerous ground,
young one.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.000
Give me the brushes.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.400
Forget it.
You're done.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.800
- Done?

22:01.760 --> 22:03.720
[Laughs]

22:03.720 --> 22:06.040
I have hunted for centuries,

22:06.040 --> 22:09.760
and I will hunt
for centuries to come.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.840
You cannot stop me.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.240
Maybe not.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.200
But your victims can.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.640
No!

22:27.680 --> 22:31.040
[Moaning]

22:32.600 --> 22:35.920
[Screams]

22:43.120 --> 22:44.560
What happened?

22:44.560 --> 22:46.000
Jenna, are you okay?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.280
I think so.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.360
Who was she?

22:51.800 --> 22:54.880
I don't think we'll ever know.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.440
Cody's artistic block
soon vanished,

22:58.440 --> 23:00.480
because she was able
to draw inspiration

23:00.480 --> 23:05.280
from all the spirits she freed
from their living nightmares.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.560
The end.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.720
Nice job.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.040
- Cool.
- That was really good.

23:10.040 --> 23:10.840
Thank you.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.640
So you going next week?

23:12.640 --> 23:13.720
Absolutely.

23:13.720 --> 23:19.120
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight Society closed.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.920
That was a great story.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.280
[Water sizzling]

23:25.400 --> 23:27.040
I owe you one.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.240
Oh, no problem.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.040
You going to be okay
for next week?

23:30.040 --> 23:30.760
I think so.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.480
I just got to look around
for some inspiration.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.720
What made you think
of that story?

23:35.720 --> 23:37.640
- You.
- Get out of here.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.280
I'm serious.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.080
You were having trouble
being creative.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.280
I saw a story there.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.920
Yeah.

23:42.920 --> 23:43.920
Cool.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.320
At least you're good
for something.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.560
[Chuckles]
Come on.
