Previously on "Lincoln Rhyme..."

00:01.327 --> 00:02.795
You can thank

00:02.828 --> 00:04.596
Officer Sachs here
for saving that evidence.

00:04.631 --> 00:06.328
Do you know how the Bone
Collector got his name?

00:06.353 --> 00:07.433
He wrote a letter saying

00:07.467 --> 00:09.260
most people are just piles of bones.

00:09.294 --> 00:10.536
What about the postmark?

00:10.570 --> 00:12.137
Tracked it back
to Farmington, New Mexico.

00:12.172 --> 00:13.205
Going through security video

00:13.239 --> 00:14.506
from the originating post office.

00:14.541 --> 00:16.108
He'd avoid cameras at all costs.

00:16.142 --> 00:18.744
I'd love to get in a sneak
of your secret lair

00:18.778 --> 00:20.646
one day when you're not at home.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.780
You're not gonna believe this.

00:21.815 --> 00:24.049
Jane... she's gone.
I think somebody took her.

00:33.827 --> 00:37.729
Decay is as natural to death
as death is to life.

00:37.764 --> 00:41.767
Decomp fields like this give us
a humane way to examine remains

00:41.801 --> 00:43.836
when affected by various elements.

00:43.870 --> 00:47.539
Weather, wildlife, indoor, outdoor.

00:47.574 --> 00:49.041
No crimes.

00:49.075 --> 00:50.976
Each of the field's residents
died naturally,

00:51.010 --> 00:52.511
donating their bodies to science

00:52.545 --> 00:54.513
to show us what death has in store.

00:54.547 --> 00:57.282
Studying the process of decay
serves a crucial purpose.

00:57.317 --> 00:59.618
To help solve murders
using forensic evidence

00:59.652 --> 01:01.954
gathered from the remains.

01:01.988 --> 01:04.289
By analyzing each stage
of the decomposition process,

01:04.324 --> 01:06.278
we can help pinpoint the time of death.

01:07.894 --> 01:10.229
A process that, as you can see,

01:10.263 --> 01:12.389
takes time to get used to.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.667
How quickly does a body
start to decompose?

01:15.702 --> 01:17.569
The process begins immediately

01:17.604 --> 01:19.605
after the heart stops beating.

01:20.607 --> 01:22.908
Hey, guys?

01:22.942 --> 01:24.409
I think this one's moving.

01:25.778 --> 01:27.012
That's impossible.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.117
Is there an animal under there?

01:37.157 --> 01:38.957
Oh, God.

01:38.992 --> 01:40.726
Call 911!

01:40.760 --> 01:43.028
Oh, my God.

01:54.908 --> 01:56.542
Ready for some movie magic?

01:56.576 --> 01:58.410
This is the first ever image
of the Bone Collector.

01:58.444 --> 02:00.879
You're really going to pause for fanfare?

02:00.914 --> 02:02.514
Okay.

02:02.549 --> 02:04.583
I was able to restore
the manager's cell phone video

02:04.617 --> 02:06.385
from the shipping center in New Mexico.

02:06.419 --> 02:10.322
You'll be the first one to see
it along with me, right now.

02:11.824 --> 02:13.425
- It's not him.
- No.

02:13.459 --> 02:14.660
No, it's not.

02:14.694 --> 02:16.795
Why risk mailing a package on camera

02:16.829 --> 02:18.063
when you can pay some junkie teenager

02:18.097 --> 02:19.164
to do it for you?

02:19.998 --> 02:21.500
Wait, pause it.

02:21.534 --> 02:23.902
Go back to before the kid went in.

02:26.472 --> 02:28.307
Hey, zoom in.

02:32.879 --> 02:34.446
That's him.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.182
A white male.

02:37.217 --> 02:39.309
Reflection's not helping much
with the details.

02:40.386 --> 02:42.921
Looks like he made a phone call.

02:42.956 --> 02:45.123
Please tell me you can get
something with that.

02:45.158 --> 02:46.158
It's gonna take some time,

02:46.192 --> 02:47.392
but I've got a few tricks I can use.

02:47.427 --> 02:48.760
All right, use them all.

02:48.795 --> 02:50.929
Lincoln? Fred Hawkins is here.

02:50.964 --> 02:52.831
- Who?
- Sellitto's friend.

02:52.865 --> 02:54.766
Firefighter, same injury as you.

02:54.801 --> 02:56.435
I told you, I'm not interested.

02:56.469 --> 02:58.804
And I ignored you and set it up.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.525
Heads up, you're walking
into a firefight.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.919
I've been warned.
I think I can handle him.

03:08.263 --> 03:11.365
Lincoln Rhyme.
It's great to finally meet you.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.933
Sorry you got dragged over here.

03:12.967 --> 03:14.635
I'm actually tied up in a case.

03:14.669 --> 03:16.270
That's great. You're back at work.

03:16.304 --> 03:17.437
So if you'll excuse me...

03:17.472 --> 03:19.239
Maybe just a quick cup of coffee?

03:20.341 --> 03:22.142
Saw a great place by the corner.

03:22.176 --> 03:23.456
Then I'll let you get back to it.

03:23.490 --> 03:24.945
Despite what you might've heard, Fred,

03:24.979 --> 03:26.647
I don't need a pep talk.

03:26.681 --> 03:28.415
Last time someone told me to be hopeful

03:28.449 --> 03:30.150
was the day my reawakened mobility

03:30.184 --> 03:31.945
returned to its stubborn slumber.

03:32.620 --> 03:35.489
I've been told that you've been creating

03:35.523 --> 03:37.724
an amazing world for yourself up here,

03:37.759 --> 03:39.426
and that's great.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.461
I also think that the world out there

03:41.496 --> 03:43.030
is still out there for you too.

03:43.064 --> 03:46.220
That's truly motivational, Fred, but...

03:46.255 --> 03:47.801
You had a deep love of this city.

03:47.835 --> 03:51.171
No, I breathed this city.

03:51.205 --> 03:52.906
It pulsed in my veins.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.942
Every cobblestone path I walked,

03:54.976 --> 03:57.110
every rickety stairwell I climbed,

03:57.145 --> 03:58.612
the parks, the tunnels...

03:58.646 --> 04:00.515
Now it's all gone.

04:01.516 --> 04:03.685
Sellitto said you used to play chess.

04:04.852 --> 04:06.355
In the park?

04:06.688 --> 04:08.956
Now I can't even lift the pawn.

04:10.991 --> 04:12.125
You're right.

04:15.463 --> 04:19.166
That's hard. Everything's harder.

04:23.404 --> 04:25.916
Things you'll probably never do again.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.776
But the ones you can do...

04:33.381 --> 04:35.133
Do them, Lincoln.

04:37.685 --> 04:39.888
I'll take a rain check on the coffee.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.260
- You do know you work for me?
- I also care about you.

04:47.295 --> 04:48.495
And you think I'm not doing enough?

04:48.529 --> 04:50.831
You are. But I see how you look

04:50.865 --> 04:53.066
when you're watching Amelia out there

04:53.101 --> 04:55.235
where you used to go and walk.
I just think...

04:55.269 --> 04:56.570
That I should get out there?

04:59.026 --> 05:00.827
How does that work for you, Claire?

05:05.519 --> 05:07.220
Sellitto is on his way.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.723
Tell me why I should love
this case so much?

05:16.758 --> 05:19.192
Josh Marlowe. 17.

05:19.227 --> 05:20.527
Found with a 14 inch cut

05:20.561 --> 05:22.396
of steel rebar drilled through his heart.

05:22.430 --> 05:24.564
I'll go out on a limb. He was murdered.

05:24.599 --> 05:27.034
It's not cause of death
that makes this our case.

05:27.068 --> 05:28.635
It's where they found him.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.737
Saranac College,

05:30.772 --> 05:32.973
their forensics anthropology site.

05:33.007 --> 05:36.009
- Seriously?
- Forensics anthropology site?

05:36.044 --> 05:38.178
A decomp farm.

05:38.212 --> 05:41.348
It's like a playground of forensics.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.183
We use them to study how nature

05:43.217 --> 05:44.651
affects the human body post mortem.

05:44.686 --> 05:47.220
A playground of dead bodies?

05:47.255 --> 05:48.522
Mm.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.724
They test the effects of everything.

05:50.758 --> 05:54.428
Water, heat, sun, insects, time...

05:54.462 --> 05:55.929
So that when it happens
to innocent people,

05:55.963 --> 05:58.799
we have data to guide us.

05:58.833 --> 06:01.601
Some of my happiest memories
from training were there.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.037
Well, don't look at me like that.

06:05.973 --> 06:07.741
Josh lived in the city.

06:07.775 --> 06:10.944
He had no ties
to the university whatsoever,

06:10.978 --> 06:12.412
except ending up dead there.

06:12.437 --> 06:14.489
So the killers hid the body
amongst a bunch of other bodies.

06:14.524 --> 06:17.050
Except there's no hiding
in a decomp farm.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.886
Students and faculty do rounds
all day long.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.689
Document every change and every cadaver.

06:22.724 --> 06:24.691
They know what bodies
are supposed to be there,

06:24.726 --> 06:25.902
and what bodies aren't.

06:25.936 --> 06:28.128
So either the killer didn't know that,

06:28.162 --> 06:30.297
or they wanted to show off
their handiwork.

06:30.331 --> 06:32.599
Either way, we gotta figure out
how a live body

06:32.633 --> 06:34.234
ended up in a field full of dead ones.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.969
And by live, he means alive.

06:36.003 --> 06:37.804
Took his last breath as they found him.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.906
Now, the chief requested someone

06:39.941 --> 06:41.742
who could investigate this

06:41.776 --> 06:43.777
without harming
their delicate little, uh...

06:43.811 --> 06:45.946
Science experiment.

06:45.980 --> 06:48.782
Hey, we might already have
our first lead.

06:48.816 --> 06:51.384
Victim's brother says
he might know who did it.

06:53.254 --> 06:55.550
Hmm. If we're lucky,

06:55.584 --> 06:58.360
the brother's right,
and it's our last lead.

06:58.860 --> 07:00.727
Let's get justice for this family.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.798
You have to get him. Arrest him.

07:04.832 --> 07:07.267
- He killed my brother.
- Ray Coyne, your stepfather?

07:07.301 --> 07:09.169
How many people
are you gonna let him kill?

07:09.203 --> 07:11.404
Ben, I believe what you're saying.

07:11.439 --> 07:13.173
Okay? And we're listening.

07:13.207 --> 07:14.841
We just wanna be armed

07:14.876 --> 07:16.143
with everything we know

07:16.177 --> 07:18.378
before we talk to your stepfather.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.799
Can you help us with that?

07:23.284 --> 07:25.886
Okay, so you asked us,

07:25.920 --> 07:28.807
"How many people
are we gonna let him kill?"

07:29.357 --> 07:30.757
Who else did Ray kill?

07:30.792 --> 07:33.460
My mother. Eight go.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.361
I should explain.

07:35.396 --> 07:37.164
Ben's mother, Grace, was my best friend.

07:37.198 --> 07:39.699
She died from complications
of a heart condition.

07:39.734 --> 07:41.501
They said that, but Josh knew

07:41.536 --> 07:43.069
Ray did something to her.

07:43.104 --> 07:46.449
- Josh knew based on what?
- He just...

07:47.475 --> 07:48.775
Knew.

07:48.810 --> 07:51.444
There were problems in the marriage.

07:51.479 --> 07:53.480
The boy's father passed away
five years ago.

07:53.514 --> 07:56.082
They never liked Ray, never accepted him.

07:56.117 --> 07:59.653
When Grace died out of nowhere,
they blamed him.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.054
Because he did it.

08:01.088 --> 08:04.491
Ray has custody, but I try and help.

08:05.260 --> 08:07.761
Ben, I wanna help you. You can trust me.

08:08.179 --> 08:11.224
You've lost a lot, too much,

08:11.999 --> 08:13.967
and I get that. Believe me, I do.

08:14.001 --> 08:16.837
So can you tell us,

08:16.871 --> 08:20.874
did Josh have any evidence?

08:20.908 --> 08:23.410
He's been trying to get evidence.

08:23.444 --> 08:25.745
- Trying how?
- He wouldn't tell me,

08:25.780 --> 08:27.091
but he said he was getting close.

08:27.125 --> 08:29.683
Ray must have found out
and followed him there.

08:29.717 --> 08:32.219
- To Saranac?
- To the body farm, yeah.

08:32.253 --> 08:33.720
I don't understand.

08:33.754 --> 08:38.225
Why would your brother
be going to the body farm?

08:38.259 --> 08:40.427
That's where our mom's body is.

08:43.530 --> 08:46.366
Mother and son dead in the same spot

08:46.400 --> 08:48.268
eight months apart.

08:50.137 --> 08:52.005
Interested now?

08:56.315 --> 08:58.662
Meet Grace Marlowe, accountant,

08:58.663 --> 09:01.431
dedicated mother of two,
and for the past eight months,

09:01.466 --> 09:04.167
resident at the Saranac College
Decomp Farm.

09:04.202 --> 09:08.104
Died from complications
of Eisenmenger syndrome.

09:08.139 --> 09:10.173
It's brought on
by an atrial septal defect,

09:10.208 --> 09:11.608
a hole in the wall

09:11.642 --> 09:12.709
between the top two chambers
of the heart.

09:12.743 --> 09:14.845
Undiagnosed, it can lead
to cardiac arrest,

09:14.879 --> 09:16.646
which is in our cause of death.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.649
Well, alleged cause of death, right?

09:19.684 --> 09:21.384
Official cause of death.

09:21.419 --> 09:23.687
Let's not get pulled offsides by two kids

09:23.721 --> 09:25.055
who don't like their mother remarrying.

09:25.089 --> 09:26.456
Wouldn't be the first murder

09:26.491 --> 09:28.325
to be labeled as natural causes,

09:28.359 --> 09:29.893
but you knew that.

09:29.927 --> 09:33.697
So Grace dies,
donates her body to science,

09:33.731 --> 09:35.866
ends up a research cadaver

09:35.900 --> 09:38.794
rotting in a field
for the better part of a year

09:38.828 --> 09:40.704
until her son comes looking for her,

09:40.738 --> 09:42.405
trying to find evidence she was murdered

09:42.440 --> 09:44.808
and dies 20 yards away from her.

09:44.842 --> 09:46.810
What a tragic reunion.

09:46.844 --> 09:48.879
- Like that Paul Simon song.
- Hm?

09:48.913 --> 09:50.714
Paul Simon.

09:50.748 --> 09:53.149
He named a song after a dish
at a Chinese restaurant.

09:53.184 --> 09:54.985
Chicken and eggs on the same plate.

09:55.019 --> 09:57.053
Called it the mother and child reunion.

09:57.287 --> 09:58.854
That's clever.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.125
I need you out on the decomp farm

10:02.159 --> 10:05.195
while Sellitto and Eric
run down the wicked stepfather.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.931
As much as I love spending
every day in here,

10:07.965 --> 10:09.933
the decomp farm is
my old stomping ground.

10:09.967 --> 10:11.301
I could go with her.

10:11.335 --> 10:12.966
She could go instead of me.

10:13.001 --> 10:15.138
I need you here with me.

10:20.945 --> 10:23.680
Fine. Go.

10:23.714 --> 10:26.016
Knock yourself out.

10:26.050 --> 10:27.651
This is gonna be awesome.

10:36.327 --> 10:38.428
I don't know if anyone's
ever told you this, but...

10:41.132 --> 10:43.500
You've a mocking tone.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.805
The way you talk to people.

10:56.514 --> 10:59.349
You're not a very nice person, Jane.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.986
But you were a good friend to Danielle.

11:11.162 --> 11:13.406
Made her feel happy...

11:15.200 --> 11:17.434
which made me feel happy.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.472
We were all happy.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.416
But all good things must come to an end.

11:40.057 --> 11:42.726
Quite a before and after.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.495
He was steps away from her.

11:45.529 --> 11:48.198
20 yards from finding out
whatever answer he wanted.

11:48.232 --> 11:50.066
The question is:

11:50.101 --> 11:51.968
what could Josh have possibly
retrieved here

11:52.003 --> 11:53.169
that would help him?

11:53.204 --> 11:54.704
In the elements like this,

11:54.739 --> 11:57.033
Grace could've been fully
skeletonized for months now.

11:57.475 --> 11:59.709
Amelia, Grace is in good hands with Kate.

11:59.744 --> 12:01.111
- We need to examine...
- Josh's crime scene.

12:01.145 --> 12:04.047
Yeah. On it.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.856
Oh, rebar.

12:12.890 --> 12:14.491
I think we can safely say

12:14.525 --> 12:16.559
we know the origin of the murder weapon.

12:16.594 --> 12:18.228
Which means this wasn't planned.

12:18.262 --> 12:20.196
Our killer had to improvise.

12:20.231 --> 12:22.165
Seems like finding evidence

12:22.199 --> 12:24.167
isn't gonna be a problem out here.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.902
Too many needles,

12:25.936 --> 12:27.704
not enough haystack.

12:27.738 --> 12:30.373
You will find
extraneous evidence, tissue,

12:30.408 --> 12:33.943
bone fragments, footprints,
but by process of elimination...

12:33.978 --> 12:36.279
Yeah, look for evidence
that doesn't belong.

12:36.313 --> 12:37.514
I got it.

12:39.917 --> 12:41.685
Look at the ground inside the site.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.788
It looks damp,
but it doesn't look like blood.

12:44.822 --> 12:47.557
Mm, let's sample it.
Check the tarp itself.

12:47.591 --> 12:50.026
It's the one thing apart from the rebar

12:50.061 --> 12:51.761
that we know the killer had contact with.

12:51.796 --> 12:54.357
Okay.

12:55.766 --> 12:57.600
Got something
on the underside of the tarp.

12:57.635 --> 12:59.436
- Blood?
- Look, zoom in.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.237
White hair stuck on blood.

13:01.272 --> 13:02.772
Sticks out like a bloody thumb.

13:02.807 --> 13:04.607
- I'll bag it.
- No.

13:04.642 --> 13:07.711
Bring in the whole tarp.
I wanna test it for everything.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.646
Hey, Coyne.

13:10.148 --> 13:12.816
Detective Sellitto, Castillo, NYPD.

13:12.850 --> 13:15.570
- I was expecting you.
- Is that right?

13:16.320 --> 13:17.654
I haven't seen or heard from Ben

13:17.688 --> 13:19.723
since I went to ID Josh's body.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.459
Melissa told me he wants
to stay with her?

13:22.493 --> 13:23.893
Figured it'd be a matter of time

13:23.928 --> 13:25.729
before he told you
what he thinks about me.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.231
What he thinks about you
is quite the accusation.

13:28.265 --> 13:31.434
Oh. He's tragically misinformed,

13:31.469 --> 13:33.503
and it breaks my heart.

13:34.972 --> 13:36.740
I loved his mother.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.742
Watching her die,

13:38.776 --> 13:41.678
suddenly, awfully... It nearly killed me.

13:43.481 --> 13:45.482
I know they didn't like me
taking their father's place,

13:45.516 --> 13:47.352
but to think I could have harmed her?

13:48.986 --> 13:52.732
When Grace was sick at the very end,

13:53.274 --> 13:56.159
she didn't want the boys
to remember her like that,

13:56.193 --> 13:59.363
so I tried to keep them
from seeing her at her worst.

13:59.830 --> 14:02.075
Josh thought I was hiding something,

14:02.700 --> 14:05.034
- but I got nothing to hide.
- Nothing?

14:05.069 --> 14:07.403
Look, I was working
when Josh was murdered.

14:07.438 --> 14:09.272
I'm a security guard. There are logs.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.640
There's video.

14:10.674 --> 14:13.009
Very sorry about Josh's death.

14:13.043 --> 14:15.211
If you have any information
you think might help

14:15.246 --> 14:17.147
or any questions...

14:17.181 --> 14:19.616
I have one question.

14:19.650 --> 14:23.846
What Josh thought
about Grace being murdered...

14:25.015 --> 14:26.248
Could that really be true?

14:27.057 --> 14:28.404
Is that why this happened?

14:31.028 --> 14:33.463
You lock up the stepfather?

14:33.497 --> 14:36.399
Seems there are two sides to every story,

14:36.433 --> 14:38.434
which means we still have to do this.

14:38.469 --> 14:41.337
- I hate morgues.
- Does anyone like morgues?

14:41.372 --> 14:43.206
Kate.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.575
Well, she'll have to enjoy remotely.

14:45.609 --> 14:46.976
Lincoln summoned her back

14:47.011 --> 14:48.378
when I interviewed the students.

14:48.412 --> 14:49.712
You get anything?

14:49.747 --> 14:51.314
Just the eerie feeling

14:51.348 --> 14:52.715
that they're teaching each
and every one of them

14:52.750 --> 14:55.318
- how to get away with murder.
- Yeah.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.986
I think the idea is to teach them

14:57.021 --> 14:58.655
how to stop people
from getting away with murder.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.924
Now let's get a look at our victim.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.859
The sooner we get out of here,
the better.

15:02.893 --> 15:04.695
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.330
Is it unusual for you, Dr. Wasden?

15:07.364 --> 15:09.465
We never get murder victims here.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.068
Uh, all of our bodies die
of natural causes,

15:12.102 --> 15:15.839
so this is quite exciting...
Professionally speaking.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.073
Totally get it.

15:17.107 --> 15:19.175
And this one is unique.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.377
Mr. Marlowe was impaled from behind

15:21.412 --> 15:23.246
between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.949
The weapon entered
just below the right shoulder

15:25.983 --> 15:27.750
before entering the right atrium

15:27.785 --> 15:29.319
and rupturing the pulmonic valve.

15:29.353 --> 15:31.154
But that's not what killed him.

15:31.188 --> 15:33.523
The valve slowly leaked blood
into his lungs,

15:33.557 --> 15:34.891
and he choked to death.

15:34.925 --> 15:37.060
He must've suffered for hours.

15:37.094 --> 15:38.528
The killer must've been in a hurry

15:38.562 --> 15:40.129
if they left him alive like that.

15:40.164 --> 15:41.929
Yeah, I thought the same thing.

15:41.963 --> 15:44.701
However, the body was cleaned...
Meticulously cleaned,

15:44.735 --> 15:46.369
swabbed beneath the nails

15:46.403 --> 15:47.904
and on all the defensive wounds.

15:47.938 --> 15:49.405
Defensive wounds?

15:49.440 --> 15:50.773
Oh, yes, there was clearly a struggle.

15:50.808 --> 15:52.442
He fought back.

15:52.476 --> 15:55.411
But I found nothing
transferred from the assailant.

15:55.446 --> 15:58.314
Covering up something like that
is no small feat.

15:58.349 --> 16:00.483
So you're saying whoever did this

16:00.517 --> 16:02.218
knew exactly what they were doing.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.587
Forensically speaking.

16:04.622 --> 16:07.557
Don't like to speculate,
but it's a fair conclusion.

16:07.591 --> 16:09.659
And how many people with
that kind of knowledge

16:09.693 --> 16:12.128
also had access
to the decomp farm at night?

16:12.162 --> 16:14.364
Well, that would be everyone here.

16:14.398 --> 16:16.432
Maybe a hundred people

16:16.467 --> 16:17.867
every semester.

16:23.305 --> 16:25.843
Officer Sachs,
someone's been waiting for you.

16:29.077 --> 16:30.845
Did you talk to him?

16:30.879 --> 16:33.300
Ben, what are you doing here?

16:33.334 --> 16:35.850
I wanna know what Ray said.
I wanna know what you found.

16:35.884 --> 16:38.152
Okay, well, we just started,

16:38.186 --> 16:41.477
and yes, our people are talking to Ray.

16:41.478 --> 16:42.821
- And what'd he say?
- Ben, come on, sit down.

16:42.856 --> 16:45.090
No, I'm... I'm not gonna... I can't sit.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.459
Look, Ben, I get
what you're feeling here.

16:47.494 --> 16:49.328
No, you don't.

16:49.362 --> 16:52.297
My brother's dead. My mother's dead.

16:54.968 --> 16:56.457
You're right.

16:57.303 --> 17:00.272
What you're feeling, no one else knows.

17:00.836 --> 17:02.608
Okay, no one can understand

17:02.642 --> 17:05.778
what that kind of loss feels like.

17:05.811 --> 17:07.679
But here's what I need you to know:

17:07.714 --> 17:10.983
it is my job, Ben, to get you
the answers that you want.

17:13.019 --> 17:16.288
Now look, if that means Ray,

17:16.321 --> 17:19.625
I don't know, but I can promise you

17:19.659 --> 17:22.428
that I will not stop
until I find something.

17:23.563 --> 17:25.830
Okay? So just sit down.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.170
You're not in this alone, Ben.

17:33.939 --> 17:35.339
We got your back.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.981
You're not gonna tell me what you found?

17:43.016 --> 17:46.485
I am when this is done.

17:46.519 --> 17:48.954
- I want to believe you.
- Well, you can.

17:48.988 --> 17:51.523
I promise you, I'm telling you the truth.

18:05.738 --> 18:07.739
Wasden's fast.

18:07.774 --> 18:10.509
Toxicology report. Marlowe, Joshua A.

18:10.543 --> 18:12.578
No volatiles, no illicits.

18:12.612 --> 18:15.321
Perfectly healthy kid
besides, you know...

18:15.356 --> 18:17.883
The stake through the heart.
What about the tarp?

18:17.917 --> 18:19.985
The only thing of note was
the hair Amelia found.

18:20.019 --> 18:21.086
It's from an Angora.

18:21.121 --> 18:22.187
Basically a house cat with white...

18:22.222 --> 18:24.056
I know what an Angora is.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.092
Okay, normally,
this wouldn't be that helpful...

18:27.127 --> 18:29.461
Because all manner of vermin
descend on decomp farms

18:29.496 --> 18:30.796
to feast on bodies.

18:30.830 --> 18:33.098
Well, cats aren't technically vermin.

18:34.033 --> 18:36.368
Anyway, the position on the
tarp suggests that the hair

18:36.402 --> 18:38.504
was between the tarp and Josh's body.

18:38.538 --> 18:40.472
Meaning it was there
before he was covered.

18:40.507 --> 18:42.508
Which is why I asked Eric
to check in with Ben.

18:42.542 --> 18:43.812
No cat.

18:43.846 --> 18:45.099
I think it came from the killer.

18:45.133 --> 18:48.280
So we're looking for a killer with a cat.

18:48.314 --> 18:50.015
- Seems to narrow it down.
- It's something!

18:50.049 --> 18:51.822
Felix!

18:54.921 --> 18:57.189
Could you please use
the button on your chair?

18:57.223 --> 18:59.224
I have kind of a thing
about being yelled at.

18:59.259 --> 19:00.626
Have you found any connections

19:00.660 --> 19:02.194
between Saranac College and Josh?

19:02.228 --> 19:04.096
I'm looking into everyone.
Faculty, staff, students.

19:04.130 --> 19:05.797
You should've been done by now.

19:05.832 --> 19:07.330
I'm working on
the Bone Collector footage.

19:07.365 --> 19:08.811
I told you to drop that for now.

19:08.845 --> 19:10.236
Yeah, you also told me to use
every tool at my disposal.

19:10.271 --> 19:13.605
Felix, after you get me what I need.

19:34.112 --> 19:37.214
- He's not himself today.
- No, no, he is.

19:38.665 --> 19:41.767
He's always been Lincoln-y
even before was in that chair.

19:42.969 --> 19:44.670
And that's fine.

19:44.704 --> 19:47.586
You know that's okay because he's good.

19:47.941 --> 19:49.755
He's better than good.

19:50.510 --> 19:52.578
I mean, I get to do things here
that I would never get to do

19:52.612 --> 19:56.148
somewhere else, but sometimes,
it is just not worth it.

19:57.584 --> 19:59.318
Honestly, I can't believe
you'd stick up for him

19:59.352 --> 20:00.719
after the way he talked to you
this morning.

20:00.753 --> 20:04.089
I was pushing him, and he wasn't wrong.

20:05.725 --> 20:07.659
I have a condition.

20:07.694 --> 20:09.795
A panic disorder, really.

20:10.763 --> 20:14.233
I can't be in crowds, can't go in public,

20:14.267 --> 20:15.968
can't even leave this apartment.

20:16.002 --> 20:18.537
- Agoraphobia.
- I wanna get out.

20:18.571 --> 20:21.006
I just can't.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.275
He can, but he doesn't want to.

20:23.309 --> 20:26.478
And that sets me off, which sets him off.

20:26.512 --> 20:28.213
My two cents?

20:28.248 --> 20:29.715
It's got nothing to do with you.

20:29.749 --> 20:32.684
His problem is that he lost
to the Bone Collector,

20:32.719 --> 20:34.586
and he cannot accept that.

20:36.042 --> 20:37.275
You're right.

20:38.358 --> 20:40.058
He's not stuck in here,

20:40.093 --> 20:42.127
he's stuck in the same place in his life

20:42.400 --> 20:43.801
ever since that night.

20:44.831 --> 20:48.100
That's it. Of course.

20:48.134 --> 20:51.603
- What?
- Stuck in the same place.

20:51.638 --> 20:53.305
I've been looking at this all wrong.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.606
Uh.

20:58.111 --> 21:00.646
Claire, we just might find
the Bone Collector after all.

21:05.585 --> 21:08.253
The beauty of chess is, you
never know how many moves ahead

21:08.288 --> 21:09.755
your opponent is thinking.

21:09.789 --> 21:12.824
So your point is, the same
is true in catching murderers.

21:12.859 --> 21:14.459
If Ray Coyne killed his stepson,

21:14.494 --> 21:16.128
was it because he also killed Grace?

21:16.162 --> 21:17.396
He feared exposure?

21:17.430 --> 21:19.031
There's two problems there.

21:19.065 --> 21:21.767
There wasn't much left of her
to be exposed,

21:21.801 --> 21:24.436
and Sellitto doesn't think Ray
looks good for it.

21:24.470 --> 21:26.038
You wanna know how many
people I've arrested

21:26.072 --> 21:27.372
who didn't look good for it?

21:27.407 --> 21:29.241
Mm.

21:29.275 --> 21:31.009
You're in high spirits today.

21:31.044 --> 21:32.678
No different than any other day.

21:32.712 --> 21:35.247
No, usually your
mild disdain and impatience

21:35.281 --> 21:37.071
are part of your charm.

21:37.483 --> 21:40.385
I come in here, and Claire's
walking on eggshells.

21:40.420 --> 21:42.688
Felix is grumbling...

21:42.722 --> 21:45.557
Maybe people should just do their jobs.

21:45.591 --> 21:48.226
Maybe they'd do them better
if the work environment

21:48.261 --> 21:50.042
was a little more...

21:50.797 --> 21:52.864
- harmonious.
- Look.

21:52.899 --> 21:55.167
I care about catching this killer.

21:55.201 --> 21:57.102
I care about finding
what happened to Josh.

21:57.136 --> 21:58.670
If I get impatient...

22:00.807 --> 22:02.638
Fine.

22:03.142 --> 22:05.110
I'll try not to get impatient.

22:05.144 --> 22:06.850
Fine.

22:07.647 --> 22:09.201
We may have found our man.

22:09.235 --> 22:11.850
Stepfather was all broken up
about his wife's death,

22:11.884 --> 22:13.885
only guess what he failed to mention.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.220
A secret girlfriend.

22:15.254 --> 22:17.522
- One of the other great
motives: money.

22:17.557 --> 22:19.958
Grace took out a $1/2 million policy

22:19.992 --> 22:21.727
on her life a year before she died.

22:21.761 --> 22:23.161
She didn't leave anything to her kids?

22:23.196 --> 22:25.197
She did entrust,

22:25.231 --> 22:27.332
and guess who the trustee is
until they come of age.

22:27.367 --> 22:29.735
Josh was about to turn 18.

22:29.769 --> 22:32.237
So Ray's share of the money
was about to go away.

22:32.271 --> 22:34.473
Problem is, his alibi holds up.

22:34.507 --> 22:36.808
Maybe because
he's not the one who did it.

22:36.843 --> 22:38.261
This is the file Saranac College

22:38.296 --> 22:41.413
gave us on Grace Marlowe.
Seemed pretty thin on evidence,

22:41.447 --> 22:43.014
so I decided to check out
a couple of other ones.

22:43.049 --> 22:46.151
This one and this one.

22:46.185 --> 22:48.487
All the other files
on decomp farm corpses

22:48.521 --> 22:52.357
include reams of info.
Detailed notes, photos...

22:52.392 --> 22:53.692
You're saying someone
was trying to cover up

22:53.726 --> 22:55.026
everything about Grace.

22:55.061 --> 22:58.330
No, not just someone. Someone we met.

22:58.364 --> 23:00.499
Autumn Bestin,

23:00.533 --> 23:02.323
the TA of the class.

23:02.358 --> 23:04.736
- The one who found the body?
- Yep.

23:04.771 --> 23:06.371
She checked out the file three days ago

23:06.406 --> 23:08.440
and emptied it of almost every
single piece of evidence

23:08.474 --> 23:09.870
on Grace,

23:09.905 --> 23:12.411
then suddenly finds her son's
body two days later?

23:12.445 --> 23:15.947
I interviewed Autumn.
She said she didn't know Josh.

23:15.982 --> 23:17.883
Sounds like Autumn lied to you.

23:28.688 --> 23:30.201
I was scared. Who wouldn't be?

23:30.235 --> 23:31.918
So you did know Josh Marlowe.

23:31.919 --> 23:33.787
Yes... I mean, barely.

23:33.821 --> 23:35.388
I'd known him for a week,

23:35.423 --> 23:37.590
I helped him find information
about his mother,

23:37.625 --> 23:39.559
and there he was. Murdered.

23:39.593 --> 23:40.980
And you didn't think mentioning
that would be relevant?

23:41.014 --> 23:42.436
I was freaked out.

23:42.471 --> 23:44.864
I've seen bodies, but never a murder.

23:44.899 --> 23:47.567
Well, that may seem more plausible

23:47.601 --> 23:50.804
if we didn't know you
emptied out his mother's file.

23:50.838 --> 23:52.852
No, that's how I found it.

23:52.886 --> 23:55.175
Why were you trying
to get it in the first place?

23:55.209 --> 23:57.644
Josh found out his mother
had donated her body here.

23:57.678 --> 23:59.746
He went around to a bunch of faculty.

23:59.780 --> 24:01.181
No one would give him anything.

24:01.215 --> 24:03.216
I mean, they're really not supposed to.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.652
- So why did you?
- I felt awful for him.

24:05.686 --> 24:08.221
His mother had been murdered.
He kept saying her name.

24:08.255 --> 24:10.957
I'd overseen her case
when she arrived at the farm.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.192
I remembered the name,

24:12.226 --> 24:14.060
so I told him
I would see what I could find.

24:14.094 --> 24:16.319
So what did you think
when you found the file?

24:16.353 --> 24:20.567
It was unusual,
so I went to the computer.

24:20.601 --> 24:22.168
There should've been backups, copies...

24:22.203 --> 24:23.303
Mm-hmm.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.205
Grace Marlowe's file was empty.

24:25.239 --> 24:26.806
Someone erased it.

24:27.616 --> 24:29.075
You told Josh this?

24:29.109 --> 24:31.978
I did, and I sent him copies
of what little I had,

24:32.012 --> 24:33.546
my personal notes from the time.

24:33.581 --> 24:35.815
- Do you still have them?
- I do.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.584
It's not much.

24:37.618 --> 24:40.086
A couple of photos,
handwritten descriptions...

24:42.122 --> 24:43.799
You think Josh was right.

24:44.458 --> 24:46.176
She was murdered?

24:46.961 --> 24:49.696
And someone killed him
because of what I gave him?

24:50.472 --> 24:51.931
Autumn's story checks out.

24:51.966 --> 24:54.434
So Ray has motive, but also an alibi.

24:54.468 --> 24:56.069
Autumn lied to us,

24:56.103 --> 24:57.637
but seems like she wanted
to help find the truth

24:57.671 --> 25:00.206
- about Grace's murder.
- Alleged murder.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.676
Oh, God.

25:03.711 --> 25:06.079
I guess that's what becomes
of us all at some point.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.814
Standard Y-shaped incision,

25:07.848 --> 25:10.049
which means they confirmed
the cardiac arrest.

25:10.084 --> 25:11.284
Autumn said she took notes.

25:11.318 --> 25:12.919
What else did she observe about the body?

25:12.953 --> 25:16.422
Skin inflammation,
deep creases in the palms,

25:16.457 --> 25:18.258
excessive white on her fingernails.

25:18.292 --> 25:20.293
Huh, Eisenmenger's syndrome
should have caused

25:20.327 --> 25:22.762
a blue tint in the skin,
not red inflammation.

25:22.796 --> 25:24.423
Show me a more recent photo.

25:25.299 --> 25:28.167
Zoom in on the sternum.

25:36.741 --> 25:40.280
No evidence of bone disease.
And only one chemical

25:40.314 --> 25:42.115
affects skeletal discoloration
post mortem.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.650
Arsenic.

25:43.684 --> 25:45.518
Changes the bone even after you're dead.

25:45.553 --> 25:47.320
Josh was right.

25:47.354 --> 25:49.289
His mother didn't die of a heart defect.

25:49.323 --> 25:51.691
- She was poisoned.
- And that's not all we pulled.

25:51.725 --> 25:53.493
Grace's medical history...

25:53.527 --> 25:56.329
She had celiac disease,
which is hereditary.

25:56.363 --> 25:58.074
Even if Josh didn't inherit the disease,

25:58.108 --> 25:59.679
he would've had the antibody deficiency,

25:59.714 --> 26:03.770
but in Wasden's tox report?
His numbers are normal.

26:03.804 --> 26:05.939
You're saying the medical
examiner assisting us

26:05.973 --> 26:08.107
on this case falsified
Josh's autopsy report?

26:08.142 --> 26:10.577
I'm saying what I see in the numbers.

26:10.611 --> 26:14.414
So, what was Dr. Wasden
trying to hide and why?

26:14.448 --> 26:16.767
What are we not seeing?

26:17.284 --> 26:18.560
Mm.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.332
Right there.

26:20.357 --> 26:21.957
We're too busy staring at the results,

26:21.982 --> 26:24.650
we weren't focused on
the signatures at the bottom.

26:24.858 --> 26:26.092
Look who performed

26:26.126 --> 26:27.694
Grace Marlowe's autopsy last year.

26:27.728 --> 26:29.462
Dr. Arthur Wasden.

26:33.307 --> 26:35.642
Detectives! How can I help you?

26:35.667 --> 26:38.435
Do you happen to own a cat, Dr. Wasden?

26:38.460 --> 26:40.227
Allergic, I'm afraid.

26:40.341 --> 26:42.041
What does this have to do with the case?

26:42.076 --> 26:44.677
Why didn't you tell us
that you performed autopsies

26:44.712 --> 26:45.979
on Josh and Grace Marlowe?

26:46.013 --> 26:48.882
Josh Marlowe's mother, Grace.

26:48.929 --> 26:50.997
Eight months ago,
you performed the autopsy,

26:51.022 --> 26:53.857
and ruled it death
by congenital heart condition.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.981
I perform a great number of autopsies.

26:56.006 --> 26:58.474
A mother and son.
That didn't strike you as odd?

26:58.499 --> 26:59.870
I wasn't aware.

26:59.895 --> 27:02.025
Well, that's
an interesting detail to miss,

27:02.050 --> 27:05.419
considering you're so meticulous.

27:05.538 --> 27:07.839
I'm not sure I appreciate
the tone of this conversation.

27:07.864 --> 27:09.998
Well, you're gonna have
to forgive our impoliteness.

27:10.023 --> 27:13.559
We're just adding up all these
very strange coincidences.

27:13.584 --> 27:15.485
You're the county medical examiner,

27:15.510 --> 27:17.811
but you also run the entire
decomp farm facility,

27:17.836 --> 27:19.403
don't you?

27:19.428 --> 27:22.063
Which gives you access
not only to the entire grounds,

27:22.088 --> 27:24.689
but every single cadaver
that enters those grounds.

27:24.714 --> 27:26.748
And all the files kept on them.

27:26.793 --> 27:28.494
We're gonna have a second examiner

27:28.519 --> 27:29.986
perform an autopsy on Josh Marlowe.

27:30.011 --> 27:31.812
Which requires a court order.

27:31.837 --> 27:35.440
Or a request from the next of kin.

27:35.804 --> 27:40.133
Josh's brother would like us
to take another look.

27:40.167 --> 27:42.435
Well, I'm sorry. That's not possible.

27:42.469 --> 27:43.936
It was apparently

27:43.971 --> 27:45.738
a terrible miscommunication
with my staff.

27:46.356 --> 27:48.074
Josh's body has been cremated.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.122
Last one.

28:03.157 --> 28:04.857
Have you seen my journals?

28:06.593 --> 28:08.795
- Really?
- Really.

28:08.829 --> 28:10.563
- You jerk.
- Hmm.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.333
Why does packing
always take twice as long

28:14.368 --> 28:15.668
as you think it's going to?

28:15.703 --> 28:18.071
Yeah. Just think,

28:18.105 --> 28:20.506
a few days from now,
we get to do it all backwards.

28:20.541 --> 28:22.975
Mm, don't pretend you're not excited.

28:23.010 --> 28:24.644
I am.

28:24.678 --> 28:25.978
Yeah.

28:26.013 --> 28:27.513
Why don't you check on the movers?

28:27.548 --> 28:29.048
Okay.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.683
I'm gonna take one last look around,

28:30.718 --> 28:32.318
make sure we're not forgetting anything.

28:32.352 --> 28:33.720
You are being paranoid.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.155
- I'm being...
- Thorough.

29:01.885 --> 29:05.451
Wait, how is it even legal
for an ME to examine a body

29:05.452 --> 29:06.819
near his own office?

29:06.853 --> 29:09.154
He's the county medical examiner.

29:09.189 --> 29:10.689
Most counties don't even have one.

29:10.724 --> 29:12.024
They rely on local physicians.

29:12.058 --> 29:13.826
Well, they're gonna have
to find a new one.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.294
Listen, if I were a betting man,

29:15.328 --> 29:16.762
all my chips would be on Wasden,

29:16.796 --> 29:18.664
but we can't arrest him.

29:18.698 --> 29:19.998
He took our only potential evidence

29:20.033 --> 29:22.501
and stuck it in an 1,800 degree furnace.

29:22.535 --> 29:24.369
Well, listen to this.

29:24.404 --> 29:27.372
In 2004, Dr. Arthur Wasden
was forced into rehab

29:27.407 --> 29:28.774
for opioid abuse.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.543
2006, filed for bankruptcy.

29:31.578 --> 29:33.825
Then gets sued
because of a deceased woman

29:33.859 --> 29:36.348
whose organs were, I kid you not,

29:36.382 --> 29:38.552
mistakenly removed for donation.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.114
Settled out of court.

29:42.139 --> 29:43.740
So he doesn't have glowing Yelp reviews.

29:43.765 --> 29:45.065
Doesn't give motive.

29:45.090 --> 29:47.424
But he does have the skills
to hide evidence

29:47.449 --> 29:48.883
on both bodies.

29:48.908 --> 29:50.609
Yes, but why kill Josh at all?

29:50.663 --> 29:52.330
Why kill his mother?

29:52.355 --> 29:53.822
Apart from doing their autopsies,

29:53.847 --> 29:55.882
Wasden has no connection to them at all.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.195
He might.

29:57.220 --> 29:58.821
Grace was an accountant, remember?

29:58.846 --> 30:00.246
The firm she worked for,

30:00.271 --> 30:01.771
they took on extra work
during the tax season,

30:01.796 --> 30:04.964
and one of the accounts
they worked... Saranac College.

30:11.785 --> 30:14.620
So what? The coroner's office
just accidentally cremated a body

30:14.654 --> 30:15.788
in an unsolved murder case?

30:15.822 --> 30:17.089
Doesn't that sound weird to you?

30:17.123 --> 30:19.158
It does, it does,

30:19.192 --> 30:21.493
and we are going to figure out
what happened,

30:21.528 --> 30:22.895
I promise you,

30:22.929 --> 30:25.724
which is why I have a few more questions.

30:25.898 --> 30:30.034
Did Josh ever mention a Dr. Wasden?

30:30.270 --> 30:32.838
He was the man who did
your mother's autopsy.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.274
Why?

30:34.534 --> 30:36.735
He had something to do
with this, didn't he?

30:37.375 --> 30:39.677
Right now, we just don't know.

30:41.414 --> 30:43.115
- Ben!
- He'll be okay.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.255
And what about you?

30:50.540 --> 30:52.224
I'll be fine.

30:52.258 --> 30:53.959
I'm just worried about Ben.

30:53.993 --> 30:55.420
I mean...

30:56.363 --> 31:01.100
does the name Arthur Wasden
mean anything to you?

31:01.334 --> 31:04.803
Not that I can recall. Why?

31:04.838 --> 31:06.271
Well, you and Grace worked together

31:06.306 --> 31:07.772
for Saranac College, right?

31:07.797 --> 31:09.164
You both did the books for them?

31:09.189 --> 31:10.523
Yeah, that's why she chose the program

31:10.548 --> 31:12.182
to donate her body to.

31:12.312 --> 31:14.648
Obviously, she didn't think
it would happen so soon.

31:15.020 --> 31:18.255
So if Grace had any old notes or files,

31:18.518 --> 31:20.052
any idea where they may be?

31:22.112 --> 31:23.545
Any way to log in to her accounts?

31:23.570 --> 31:26.772
No, I'm sure they shut down
access when she died.

31:27.026 --> 31:29.161
I'm really sorry. I wish I could help.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.801
I'll be damned.

31:35.835 --> 31:37.736
The one clue we're looking for

31:37.770 --> 31:39.605
literally just walked right up to us.

31:39.639 --> 31:41.974
- You have a cat?
- Oh.

31:42.008 --> 31:44.576
Not really.
It's just a neighborhood stray.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.882
I fed her once,

31:45.916 --> 31:48.109
and now she comes in and out
like she owns the place.

31:48.134 --> 31:50.469
Wait, are we really saying
she killed her best friend

31:50.494 --> 31:51.761
and her best friend's son?

31:53.345 --> 31:55.480
- Everything okay?
- Mia, get out of there.

31:55.505 --> 31:56.906
Yeah, no, I'm a... um...

31:56.931 --> 31:58.932
Let us get enough evidence for a warrant.

31:58.957 --> 32:00.391
I just realized something.

32:00.416 --> 32:04.085
You worked on
the Saranac College accounts

32:04.110 --> 32:07.008
with Grace, didn't you?

32:07.033 --> 32:08.634
Amelia, what are you doing?

32:08.668 --> 32:09.834
What do you mean?

32:09.859 --> 32:11.803
Your company's records will show

32:11.838 --> 32:14.973
that you do know Dr. Wasden.

32:15.008 --> 32:17.210
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.471
So whatever you
and Dr. Wasden were doing...

32:20.646 --> 32:24.082
You and Grace must've been
really good friends,

32:24.107 --> 32:27.310
because she confronted you
instead of turning you in,

32:27.335 --> 32:32.573
and you repaid that kindness
by poisoning her?

32:32.598 --> 32:34.899
Then you must've regretted it.

32:34.924 --> 32:36.896
That's why you watch out for the boys.

32:38.197 --> 32:40.832
Until, of course, Josh
got too close to the truth.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.367
I want you to leave.

32:42.402 --> 32:44.303
Amelia, we don't have enough
to detain her.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.305
You'd be better served
to look for that cat

32:46.339 --> 32:47.606
so we can match the hair.

32:47.640 --> 32:51.777
I am not leaving her here with Ben.

32:51.811 --> 32:53.378
Who are you talking to?

32:53.413 --> 32:57.149
Ben. Ben!

32:58.351 --> 32:59.584
Weapon!

32:59.619 --> 33:01.219
I am not counting to three, Melissa.

33:02.288 --> 33:04.174
Drop the knife.

33:04.757 --> 33:06.024
Drop the knife.

33:06.059 --> 33:08.060
Don't make me have to shoot you.

33:08.094 --> 33:09.561
Drop it!

33:10.930 --> 33:12.297
Hands behind your head.

33:12.665 --> 33:14.766
Think we have enough to detain her now?

33:14.801 --> 33:16.201
Oh, my God.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.451
Any sign of Ben?

33:27.476 --> 33:29.310
We just got off the phone with Ray Coyne.

33:29.335 --> 33:30.869
Ben was there 15 minutes ago.

33:30.894 --> 33:32.461
He told Ray he was sorry,

33:32.486 --> 33:34.020
said he found out it was
someone at Saranac College

33:34.045 --> 33:35.512
that killed Josh.

33:35.537 --> 33:37.238
Ray went to call off work,
and when he came back,

33:37.263 --> 33:38.797
Ben was gone.

33:38.958 --> 33:40.258
Took his truck and his gun.

33:41.761 --> 33:43.428
Oh, God.

33:43.463 --> 33:45.097
I mentioned Wasden to Ben.

33:45.131 --> 33:46.732
I mean... he asked me
if he was a suspect.

33:46.766 --> 33:48.066
You didn't tell him
that we like him for it?

33:48.101 --> 33:49.334
No, of course not.

33:49.369 --> 33:51.036
Look, if he is headed to Saranac,

33:51.070 --> 33:53.647
we need to get there before
Ben makes a huge mistake.

33:53.681 --> 33:56.074
And another body ends up on that field.

34:02.721 --> 34:04.439
That's Ray's truck,
and that must be Wasden's car.

34:04.474 --> 34:07.108
- They're in there somewhere.
- Well, we have to find him.

34:07.143 --> 34:09.210
We can't let Ben get to Wasden.

34:09.245 --> 34:11.346
All right, fan out.
Backup will be here any minute.

34:17.018 --> 34:19.387
Deep breaths. Stay alert.

34:31.601 --> 34:32.634
Jeez.

34:34.347 --> 34:35.670
You got anything?

34:35.705 --> 34:37.739
Nothing moving.

34:44.580 --> 34:47.282
They're entering the
confined location area now.

34:47.315 --> 34:48.583
What does that mean?

34:48.618 --> 34:51.219
Decomp farms store bodies
anyplace they can.

34:51.254 --> 34:53.288
Submerged underwater, in car trunks,

34:53.322 --> 34:54.687
stuffed in barrels.

34:54.722 --> 34:56.056
Lots of places to hide.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.043
Great.

34:58.077 --> 34:59.228
Go back.

34:59.263 --> 35:02.031
Blue car. Glass.

35:03.133 --> 35:05.211
There's condensation
on the driver's side window.

35:06.470 --> 35:08.337
Oh, someone's inside.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.773
NYPD! Get out of the vehicle

35:10.807 --> 35:13.175
and put your hands where I can see them!

35:13.210 --> 35:15.077
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

35:17.548 --> 35:19.015
- He's behind you!
- Ben!

35:19.049 --> 35:20.249
No.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.096
Don't pull that trigger.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.521
You don't wanna do this. Trust me.

35:29.526 --> 35:31.627
Okay. I'm putting my gun away.

35:31.662 --> 35:33.195
- Amelia!
- See?

35:33.230 --> 35:34.964
Out of the way.

35:34.998 --> 35:37.066
- He killed my brother.
- No!

35:37.100 --> 35:40.202
No, Ben, Dr. Wasden
did not kill your brother.

35:40.237 --> 35:42.338
You're lying. You're just saying that

35:42.372 --> 35:43.873
- so I won't shoot him.
- No, I promise you.

35:43.907 --> 35:46.175
He didn't kill your brother.

35:46.209 --> 35:48.004
He didn't kill your mom, either.

35:48.645 --> 35:50.346
Then who did?

35:50.380 --> 35:53.460
Just put the gun down.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.117
Then we can talk about it.

35:55.845 --> 35:56.953
Okay?

35:56.987 --> 35:58.888
I don't think you wanna shoot me.

35:59.518 --> 36:00.752
Come on.

36:00.777 --> 36:02.325
Put it down.

36:02.359 --> 36:03.859
Easy, Ben.

36:03.894 --> 36:05.628
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Good job.

36:05.662 --> 36:07.129
Good job.

36:09.859 --> 36:11.434
Okay, it's over now.

36:11.468 --> 36:13.603
Okay?

36:13.637 --> 36:15.271
It's okay.

36:15.305 --> 36:17.740
Not very smart, doctor.
Put your hands up.

36:26.516 --> 36:29.151
Melissa was the one who poisoned Grace.

36:29.186 --> 36:30.553
Doesn't make any sense.

36:30.587 --> 36:33.556
Grace discovered Melissa and Dr. Wasden

36:33.590 --> 36:35.891
were embezzling from the college.

36:35.926 --> 36:38.828
He talked her through how to do it,

36:38.862 --> 36:42.565
and how to make it look
like she just died.

36:42.599 --> 36:45.101
When Josh got too close
to figuring it out,

36:45.135 --> 36:46.787
Melissa had to stop him.

36:46.822 --> 36:49.105
She must've followed him
out there, they had a fight...

36:49.139 --> 36:51.907
- That was her too?
- She panicked,

36:51.942 --> 36:53.509
called Wasden.

36:53.543 --> 36:55.488
He talked her through covering it up.

36:59.387 --> 37:00.754
I thought it was you.

37:02.537 --> 37:04.286
I'm sorry. I'm just...

37:05.889 --> 37:07.923
Sorry.

37:07.958 --> 37:10.359
All I ever wanted to do
was to be a father to you.

37:13.063 --> 37:14.897
I want you to come home, Ben.

37:17.134 --> 37:18.801
I'd like that.

37:24.574 --> 37:26.254
What's that?

37:26.288 --> 37:28.244
Your case, wrapped up,

37:28.278 --> 37:29.545
with a bow on it.

37:29.579 --> 37:31.781
- You actually put a bow on it?
- Yes.

37:31.815 --> 37:33.315
Yes, I did.

37:33.350 --> 37:35.451
You actually went to a store,
bought a bow,

37:35.485 --> 37:37.086
and put it on a homicide case file.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.698
I have bows at home.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.785
Two homicides, by the way.

37:42.819 --> 37:46.080
Sellitto finalized the
paperwork on both confessions.

37:46.622 --> 37:48.690
These are just the forensics
finally adding up.

37:48.715 --> 37:50.382
They always do.

37:50.493 --> 37:51.669
Eventually.

37:56.032 --> 37:57.533
Thank you, by the way,

37:57.567 --> 37:58.934
for letting me go out in the field.

38:00.289 --> 38:02.891
- Felt like old times.
- Of course.

38:11.014 --> 38:12.398
Claire?

38:13.349 --> 38:14.996
Yes?

38:20.190 --> 38:22.283
I don't do apologies well.

38:23.526 --> 38:25.127
You don't do them at all.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.463
So we can skip to the part

38:27.497 --> 38:29.298
where you know I didn't mean what I said?

38:30.667 --> 38:32.134
We could,

38:32.168 --> 38:34.236
or we could just jump to the part

38:34.270 --> 38:36.638
where we realize that my job
is to take care of you

38:37.215 --> 38:39.074
and not to push you.

38:39.592 --> 38:41.177
Sometimes...

38:42.278 --> 38:44.313
those are the same thing, aren't they?

38:47.016 --> 38:48.484
Fred Hawkins,

38:48.518 --> 38:51.420
our nauseatingly pleasant
firefighter friend.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.567
Still have his number?

39:05.235 --> 39:08.170
New York is famously inaccessible.

39:08.204 --> 39:10.572
Only half the subway stops
have elevators.

39:10.607 --> 39:13.175
There's traffic, cobblestone streets.

39:15.912 --> 39:17.479
Tourists.

39:19.215 --> 39:21.683
But everything can be navigated.

39:21.718 --> 39:25.888
And sometimes, you
just gotta ask for help.

39:25.922 --> 39:28.157
This may come as a surprise.

39:28.191 --> 39:30.325
While I may be amazing
at a lot of things,

39:30.360 --> 39:32.427
asking for help is not one of them.

39:34.397 --> 39:36.798
Yeah, that's not surprising at all.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.519
How do we do this?

39:57.554 --> 40:00.255
Well, I could
painstakingly move each piece

40:00.290 --> 40:01.857
with a pointer stick,

40:01.891 --> 40:03.926
or we could...

40:06.095 --> 40:08.530
- Ask for help.
- Right.

40:08.565 --> 40:10.065
Not your comfort zone.

40:11.701 --> 40:14.836
William, do you think you
could move these pieces for us?

40:14.871 --> 40:16.505
Of course.

40:16.539 --> 40:17.899
Thank you.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.577
All right.

40:21.611 --> 40:24.746
How about pawn to E4?

40:29.319 --> 40:30.619
It's your move.

40:42.098 --> 40:43.999
Felix.

40:45.134 --> 40:46.427
He's back.

40:46.452 --> 40:49.153
- How did it go?
- I beat him in seven moves.

40:52.202 --> 40:53.893
You said you have something
on the Bone Collector.

40:55.478 --> 40:57.813
So I looked into the phone
the Bone Collector used

40:57.847 --> 41:00.649
in the surveillance footage.
Even isolating the signal,

41:00.683 --> 41:02.460
I can't trace the number back
to a person.

41:02.494 --> 41:04.820
But you're saying you were
able to isolate the signal?

41:04.854 --> 41:06.688
Um... all right.

41:06.723 --> 41:10.559
First hit? Farmington, New Mexico.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.428
- Our man in the mirror.
- The mail drop.

41:13.463 --> 41:15.897
Next up, we got Norman, Oklahoma.

41:15.932 --> 41:19.034
Chesterfield, Missouri.
Springfield, Illinois.

41:19.068 --> 41:22.471
Columbus, Ohio. Quakertown, PA.

41:22.505 --> 41:24.406
I think we can safely extrapolate

41:24.440 --> 41:26.575
where this path is heading.

41:26.609 --> 41:29.278
To the greatest city in the world.

41:29.312 --> 41:32.047
And to start the game all over again.

41:42.725 --> 41:44.159
It's good to be home.
