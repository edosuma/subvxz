10:48.473 --> 10:51.651
Um, I read the congressman in
on your friend Brett

10:51.694 --> 10:53.870
and the troubles he had after
he left the service.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.960
Rebecca's convinced me to add
Mr. Swann's Purple Heart

10:57.004 --> 10:59.093
and the fight against TBI
to the list of my commitments.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.921
You know, there's about
a million other names

11:00.964 --> 11:02.270
you can add to that list, sir.

11:02.313 --> 11:05.490
He's as persistent as you,
Rebecca.

11:05.534 --> 11:08.972
I think D.C. has
a new power couple.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.757
Excuse me
one minute, please.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.454
[soft jazz music playing]

11:12.497 --> 11:14.195
I hope I didn't overstep.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.849
No, not at all.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.808
Let's see if that, uh,
pencil-pushing bureaucrat

11:18.852 --> 11:20.114
actually follows through.

11:20.157 --> 11:22.812
That "pencil-pusher" has
more power in this town

11:22.856 --> 11:24.945
than a platoon
of your soldiers.

11:24.988 --> 11:28.122
[chuckles]
I'm a sailor.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.472
And, evidently, half
of a, uh, power couple.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.909
Well, we have a long way to go
before we can give

11:32.953 --> 11:34.868
John and Jackie
a run for their money.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.959
A, um, key to my
place is a start.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.265
This way you can
escape to VA Beach

11:41.309 --> 11:44.399
whenever you need to detox
from Capitol Hill.Thank you.

11:44.442 --> 11:48.664
But we don't have to stay in
Virginia Beach tonight, do we?

11:48.708 --> 11:52.102
I'd rather not wait three hours
to do what I want to do.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.583
We should go to your place.

11:54.626 --> 11:57.151
Like now, huh?
Yeah.

11:57.194 --> 12:00.589
Mmm. Whoo!

12:00.632 --> 12:02.199
That is nectar of the gods.[coughing]

12:02.243 --> 12:04.288
Whoo! What is wrong with you?

12:04.332 --> 12:05.463
Are you kidding me?

12:05.507 --> 12:06.987
You're lucky the boys
aren't here

12:07.030 --> 12:08.553
to see this pathetic display.Ha.

12:08.597 --> 12:09.859
You need to pull it together.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.295
Look, well, at least
I'm here, right?

12:11.339 --> 12:12.906
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

12:12.949 --> 12:14.951
All throughout Green Team,
I hear about Bravo

12:14.995 --> 12:17.606
and their legendary
partying ways, right?Yeah.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.261
And then I get here and,
you know, no offense,

12:20.304 --> 12:23.046
but other than you, the team's
a bunch of spinsters, man.

12:23.090 --> 12:26.180
We are in transition. Okay?Mm-hmm.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.790
We're in a bit
of a downward spiral,

12:27.834 --> 12:30.053
but I promise you this, okay?

12:30.097 --> 12:32.969
Bravo will be back
with a vengeance.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.319
Even Clay?

12:35.363 --> 12:40.194
Well, that little,
uh, puppy dog,

12:40.237 --> 12:41.804
he is a lost cause.
[laughs]

12:41.848 --> 12:43.153
Come on, you don't mean that.

12:43.197 --> 12:46.896
No. Look,
I'll tell you this, man.

12:46.940 --> 12:51.118
Clay is by far the best
pipe hitter I've ever seen ever.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.815
And for some reason,
things just aren't

12:52.859 --> 12:54.164
good enough for
him right now.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.949
What do you mean?

12:55.992 --> 12:58.342
Well, he almost left the team
for his ex-girlfriend Stella.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.824
In my opinion, he dodged
a huge bullet on that one.

13:01.868 --> 13:02.912
Yeah, not a fan.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.653
After that, being a frogman,

13:04.696 --> 13:06.002
well, it just wasn't
good enough.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.177
Let me tell you something.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.919
Bravo is my family.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.181
With or without Clay.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.530
Comprende? Loud and clear.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.271
Okay, let's get another
shot and get weird.

13:14.315 --> 13:15.620
All right.
Andre.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.622
[sirens wailing outside]

13:17.666 --> 13:20.625
More hostages have been coming
into the facility by the day.

13:20.669 --> 13:23.150
Violence is spreading
into the streets.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.760
[men shouting outside]

13:24.804 --> 13:26.849
I'm not sure how you
got me to do this.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.243
Well, you knew you were
doing the right thing.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.071
And you can't resist my charms.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.768
[laughs softly]

13:32.812 --> 13:36.859
What's the security situation
around the hostages?

13:36.903 --> 13:38.252
Guys with guns.

13:38.295 --> 13:41.168
Anything out of the ordinary?

13:41.211 --> 13:43.126
One prisoner said,
"Grapes of Wrath."

13:43.170 --> 13:45.781
Is that some code word?

13:45.825 --> 13:48.088
They're gonna be moved
out of the facility.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.046
If we lose their trail,
they're as good as dead.

13:50.090 --> 13:53.049
My team has to get in there.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.529
Good.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.096
I should note that
the hostages were being

13:56.139 --> 13:57.271
moved to a different floor.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.969
What floor?

14:00.013 --> 14:01.579
How many more security
around them?

14:01.623 --> 14:04.452
Oddly, the barbarians didn't
feel the need to loop me in.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.758
I'm gonna need
a little more, Isaac.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.065
We can't hit a target
with so many unknowns.

14:09.109 --> 14:12.242
Uh-uh. Your smile won't
work this time, Mandy.

14:12.286 --> 14:15.158
The Special Police are
rounding up anyone suspicious.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.247
I...

14:17.291 --> 14:19.380
I'm on a flight out of here
this afternoon.

14:21.295 --> 14:24.341
Well, you're the only one
who can get in there

14:24.385 --> 14:25.995
and get me that information.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.867
[exhales sharply]

14:29.869 --> 14:31.479
Why did I agree to any of this?

14:31.522 --> 14:34.438
For the same reason you became
a doctor-- to help people.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.876
Oh, that's not fair.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.095
I've done more than
you asked already.

14:43.317 --> 14:46.059
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.280
You've got every right
to get out of here.

14:50.324 --> 14:54.806
But if I don't get eyes
back inside that facility,

14:54.850 --> 14:58.201
my team and the hostages
you are treating

14:58.245 --> 14:59.986
are in serious danger.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.205
They need you.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.947
I need you.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.998
You'll get me out of the country
as soon as possible?

15:14.043 --> 15:15.653
You can trust me.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.967
[clearing throat]

15:36.283 --> 15:37.588
[knocking on door]

15:48.382 --> 15:49.426
Hi.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.690
Hey.

15:54.214 --> 15:55.737
Surprise. [chuckles]

15:55.780 --> 15:59.349
[chuckles]

15:59.393 --> 16:01.395
[Jason whistles]

16:07.792 --> 16:09.229
All right.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.231
["Tomorrow Is Coming"
by Ocha La Rocha playing]

16:11.274 --> 16:13.624
Got to love that.[laughs]

16:13.668 --> 16:15.278
Fries.

16:15.322 --> 16:18.629
You must really like Natalie
if she's convinced you to eat

16:18.673 --> 16:20.675
meatless burgers.Well, all I know

16:20.718 --> 16:23.156
is that she told me
if I eat these things,Mm-hmm.

16:23.199 --> 16:26.246
it's gonna prolong my,
uh, operating days.
Oh.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.030
Look, the jury's still out.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.946
She works at DEVGRU
as, um, a physiologist?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.730
Yeah, physiologist.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.560
I admit I should've
told you about her,

16:36.604 --> 16:40.434
but I didn't, all right?
I didn't mean to blindside you.

16:40.477 --> 16:43.785
It is weird seeing you
with someone other than Mom.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.005
I just didn't want to
upset you, that's all.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.530
I don't expect you to be
by yourself forever, Dad.

16:49.573 --> 16:53.316
I hate thinking of you alone
in your depressing apartment.[chuckles]

16:53.360 --> 16:55.362
As weird as it sounds,
it's nice to know

16:55.405 --> 16:57.407
someone's looking out for you
when I'm not around.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.974
Besides, it's not like
I've told you

16:59.018 --> 17:00.280
about my boyfriends
at school.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.717
Boyfriends? Interesting. Okay.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.328
That would be a plural, and
I'm gonna say, you know what,

17:05.372 --> 17:08.592
I'm contacting Full Metal after
this little lunch we just had

17:08.636 --> 17:12.727
to make sure that he is camped
outside of your dorm room 24/7.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.253
I bet Natalie's upset.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.603
She's a strong woman.
She'll be able to handle it.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.344
She's not
important enough

17:21.388 --> 17:22.911
to tell your kids about?

17:22.954 --> 17:25.653
She'll understand that I was
just protecting you, that's all.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.437
Or protecting yourself?

17:27.481 --> 17:30.788
Okay, what is that supposed
to mean? Protecting myself?

17:30.832 --> 17:33.922
Remember Mom and her
crossword puzzles?Yeah.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.880
She used to do them
when I was deployed.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.535
No. It's how she passed the time
when you were around.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.885
She'd sit at the kitchen table
doing her puzzles

17:40.929 --> 17:42.713
while you were busy
finding different ways

17:42.757 --> 17:45.325
to shut her out of your life.You know what?

17:45.368 --> 17:47.414
That's not fair.
Took years,

17:47.457 --> 17:49.198
but you pushed Mom away.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.287
I just hope you're not
doing the same with Natalie.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.030
What do you say we lighten

17:55.074 --> 17:57.511
this moment up?
Change the song.

17:57.554 --> 17:58.773
Yeah? I'm doing it now.Right?

17:58.816 --> 17:59.861
[upbeat music plays]Bam.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.123
Right there.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.213
Is-is the leg okay?

18:04.257 --> 18:06.041
I mean, you look good.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.131
I mean, healthy. [chuckles]

18:09.175 --> 18:13.744
Yeah, no, it's good.
The leg is, uh, got no issues.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.006
Mm. Bravo's been

18:15.050 --> 18:17.531
kicking down some
nicer doors these days.

18:17.574 --> 18:21.230
I never pegged you
for, uh, Italian shoes.

18:21.274 --> 18:24.668
Looks nice.
Are you okay?

18:24.712 --> 18:27.541
I mean, I thought
we parted on good terms.

18:27.584 --> 18:31.632
Yeah, no, I just,
I'm a little...

18:31.675 --> 18:34.983
a little thrown
that you're here right now.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.116
Why are you, why are you here?

18:37.159 --> 18:39.161
I mean, in-in Virginia.My department

18:39.205 --> 18:41.555
was hit with severe budget cuts,

18:41.598 --> 18:44.471
and I was low man
on the totem pole,

18:44.514 --> 18:46.603
so... [clicks tongue]

18:46.647 --> 18:48.997
I took a job at Old Dominion,
and here I am.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.825
Hmm.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.697
I kind of figured you were out
of my life for good this time.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.570
Ouch. [chuckles]

18:56.613 --> 18:59.486
I didn't mean it
like that.
Mm-hmm.

18:59.529 --> 19:04.447
Just, um, imagined you'd
moved out to California

19:04.491 --> 19:07.363
and met some-some
tech dude, you know?

19:07.407 --> 19:10.061
Started drinking kombucha
and driving a Prius.[chuckles]

19:10.105 --> 19:12.934
Moved into a yurt, forced him
to read Kate Bornstein,

19:12.977 --> 19:17.330
never looked back on your days
slumming it here.

19:17.373 --> 19:20.246
I never felt like
I was slumming it.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.117
Truth is, I...

19:22.161 --> 19:25.555
I never felt at home
so far away from here.

19:30.299 --> 19:33.998
I, uh, I got to go to work.Oh.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.044
Yeah. Sure.
[clears throat]

19:36.087 --> 19:37.567
Thank you for the coffee.Yeah.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.613
Yeah, yeah. Um...

19:45.184 --> 19:47.969
I would love
to talk again.

19:49.623 --> 19:53.017
I-I just miss you.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.239
Okay, bye.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.937
Bye.
Bye.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.288
[door closes]

20:04.159 --> 20:06.814
MACK: I know that you're eager
to get your packet submitted,

20:06.857 --> 20:09.295
which is why I invited
Captain Lindell to participate.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.601
Appreciate you very much,
Warrant Officer Mack.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.560
In your OMPF,
you're described as "a rock,"

20:13.603 --> 20:16.737
the soul of the team.I care about
my teammates,

20:16.780 --> 20:19.261
the same way
they care about me, sir.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.394
Biggest question I have is: why?
Why warrant officer?

20:21.437 --> 20:24.397
I feel it's both my duty
and obligation to serve

20:24.440 --> 20:26.790
the United States Navy in a role
that maximizes my efficacy.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.184
Well, that was
well-rehearsed.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.273
You workshop that answer
with your wife last night?

20:31.317 --> 20:33.144
Yes, sir, I did.

20:33.188 --> 20:36.539
Okay. Now give us the real
reason why you've bypassed

20:36.583 --> 20:40.239
making master chief
and running your own team.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.850
I belong on Bravo, sir.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.634
Because they need you?

20:47.681 --> 20:50.249
[phones ringing and vibrating]

20:52.076 --> 20:53.904
LINDELL:
Eh, duty calls.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.254
We'll pick this up
when you return,

20:55.297 --> 20:58.257
Senior Chief Perry.
Dismissed.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.694
LINDELL: All right,
gentlemen. CIA put in

21:00.737 --> 21:03.305
the request for this op, but
you still need my green light.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.046
Situation on the ground
in Caracas dictates

21:05.089 --> 21:06.352
we'll need it fast,
Captain.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.658
Political instability,
rival factions fighting

21:08.702 --> 21:09.920
for valuable resources.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.487
It's bloody as hell
and getting worse, Sir.

21:11.531 --> 21:14.360
Yeah, not to mention FARC,
National Liberation Movement,

21:14.403 --> 21:16.971
Hezbollah, even these Colombian
guerrillas, drug guerrillas

21:17.014 --> 21:18.320
get in this action.JASON: Right, well,

21:18.364 --> 21:19.582
it's a potluck of hell.
We know that,

21:19.626 --> 21:22.455
but we've been
training weeks for this op.

21:22.498 --> 21:25.371
Three weeks ago,
Venezuelan Special Police,

21:25.414 --> 21:27.286
country's own version of the SS,

21:27.329 --> 21:30.724
apprehended three oil executives
from a hotel in Caracas

21:30.767 --> 21:32.203
under suspicion
that they were spies.

21:32.247 --> 21:35.032
Turns out one of them is.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.208
CIA Agent Carlos Ramos.

21:37.252 --> 21:40.037
Working under
nonofficial cover.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.518
A CIA-SOCOM joint task force

21:42.562 --> 21:46.217
is already boots-on-the-ground
prepping the AO.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.523
Word is they're gonna
move the prisoners,

21:47.567 --> 21:49.569
and we need to strike
before that happens.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.049
According to CTR,
this holding facility's

21:52.093 --> 21:54.487
pretty lax with its security.

21:54.530 --> 21:57.925
It's got a low-rent gate guard,
and the gate is usually open.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.231
That's good, then it's
a straightforward plan.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.495
We fast-rope in on the roof,
take out the guards,

22:02.538 --> 22:04.366
get the prisoners,
and we're out of this country

22:04.410 --> 22:06.150
before the Venezuelans
know we're there.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.283
What about contingencies?
Groups down there aren't exactly

22:08.327 --> 22:09.937
following standard tactics.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.243
They want to get dirty with us,
we'll get in the mud with them.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.897
All right, you're a go.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.596
JSOC wants someone down there
as part of "Special Activities."

22:16.639 --> 22:19.425
Since Senior Chief Perry can't
fill those shoes yet,

22:19.468 --> 22:21.601
Warrant Officer Mack
will be going with you.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.037
Gentlemen,
you be safe.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.386
Boys...

22:24.430 --> 22:26.649
Petty Officer Spenser, a word.

22:26.693 --> 22:29.652
I received a phone call
from Representative Suzuki

22:29.696 --> 22:32.873
asking about Brett Swann.Oh.

22:32.916 --> 22:35.136
Glad to hear the Veteran Affairs
chair is finally doing his job.

22:35.179 --> 22:37.356
Oh, the congressman's
very taken with you.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.401
And I thought we had
an understanding

22:39.445 --> 22:40.794
about letting me
handle this?

22:40.837 --> 22:43.100
Uh, Suzuki's just looking
to make things better.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.406
Same as you.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.277
You come and see me
when you get back.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.410
This conversation
is far from over.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.325
Sir.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.327
[knocks]

22:52.371 --> 22:55.548
Hey. Hey.

22:55.591 --> 22:58.377
What you working on?

22:58.420 --> 23:00.161
How was your night with Emma?

23:02.206 --> 23:04.208
I'm sorry about that.

23:04.252 --> 23:08.256
Lucky for you,
I live for awkward moments.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.867
You two obviously
had a lot to talk about.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.391
She staying the weekend?

23:12.434 --> 23:15.394
Not anymore, I...
I'm spun up in an hour.

23:17.483 --> 23:21.225
Look, I should've told her
about you.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.358
How do you have
that conversation

23:23.402 --> 23:25.578
after all
that you've been through?

23:25.621 --> 23:28.363
Well, with Emma, she's fine.
She's strong, she can handle it.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.452
I'm not talking
about Emma.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.455
What does that mean?

23:33.499 --> 23:37.764
I understand how much
you're carrying around, Jason.

23:37.807 --> 23:40.549
And how much
you're keeping from me.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.247
I don't take my baggage
downrange.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.640
There something
wrong with that?

23:44.684 --> 23:48.078
You can't keep all these worlds
separate forever.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.471
It's what I know.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.255
Yeah, that does not mean
that it works.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.344
Like I said, my
world is messy.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.697
We'll talk when you're back.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.438
Be safe.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.268
[indistinct radio chatter]

24:07.707 --> 24:11.972
So we finally get a chance to go
outside the wire, and y'all

24:12.015 --> 24:16.367
are acting like somebody
pee-peed in your grits.

24:16.411 --> 24:18.674
Like, Sonny, it's
a long flight.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.241
Want to give it
a rest, brother?

24:20.284 --> 24:23.113
I'm sorry, Mr. Ray Perry,
I didn't realize

24:23.157 --> 24:26.769
becoming a warrant officer
made you so sad and grumpy.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.990
Turn that frown upside down?
Somebody need a hug? Mm?

24:30.033 --> 24:32.688
[babbles, laughs]Cute.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.516
Tell you what, Sonny,
if I were you,

24:34.560 --> 24:36.431
I would, uh, I'd pound a bunch
of laxatives,

24:36.475 --> 24:38.738
because remember what happened
to you in Mexico last year?

24:38.781 --> 24:39.956
RAY [chuckles]:
Yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.176
Montezuma made it all the way
to Venezuela?

24:42.219 --> 24:45.179
RAY: Mm-hmm.I hate that dude.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.529
I do.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.618
Hey, sit on ice.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.446
Heard the review board
got cut short.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.231
Sorry, man.Eh...

24:54.275 --> 24:57.974
No use in, uh, worrying about
what I can't control. Right?

24:59.672 --> 25:01.543
Man, I don't know
how you do that.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.545
Nothing rattles you.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.809
No man added a day
onto his life through worry.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.507
You know, this is funny
coming from you.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.814
I was starting to wonder
if you were capable of emotion.

25:11.858 --> 25:14.121
Learned to hide it, I guess.

25:14.164 --> 25:16.253
Not always.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.560
Something's got you
rattled right now. What's up?

25:18.604 --> 25:20.519
No, it's nothing.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.391
Just those first ops we ran
when I joined Bravo,

25:23.434 --> 25:24.914
they feel like a lifetime ago.

25:24.958 --> 25:28.570
That's why we train, kid.Yeah, I know.

25:28.614 --> 25:32.052
I just don't want to be
Bravo's squeaky wheel, you know?

25:32.095 --> 25:34.054
You need to relax.

25:34.097 --> 25:36.143
You've made me look good
for standing up for you so far,

25:36.186 --> 25:38.188
so you've got that
going for you.

25:38.232 --> 25:41.191
I owe you
everything for that.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.890
Just keep pulling your weight.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.282
As far as I'm concerned,
we're square.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.546
Yeah?All right.

25:54.161 --> 25:57.381
You know, if you're gonna ask me
for money for your campaign,

25:57.425 --> 26:00.602
you know, well's dry.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.909
Uh, I'm not sure I'm electable
with the issues I'm facing

26:02.952 --> 26:04.693
on the home front.

26:06.216 --> 26:08.218
Women issues, huh?

26:08.262 --> 26:10.438
Must be going around.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.614
You want to talk about it?Nope.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.269
I do not want to
talk about it.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.314
Do you?

26:17.358 --> 26:18.620
Nope.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.883
Carry on.

26:24.539 --> 26:27.890
[men shouting]

26:34.767 --> 26:37.030
Knew the situation was bad
down here, but I didn't know

26:37.073 --> 26:38.553
it was the Wild West.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.424
SONNY: Yeah, good thing
we came during the Purge.

26:40.468 --> 26:43.558
CLAY:
Any more pressure gets applied,
this city's gonna implode.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.647
All right, which is why
we do this hit fast.

26:45.691 --> 26:46.561
In and out, got it?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.476
TRENT:
Ah, Ensign Davis.

26:48.519 --> 26:49.651
Pretty sure the
officers' quarters

26:49.695 --> 26:50.870
are down the street
at the Ritz.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.263
Wow. You guys really need
some new material.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.657
Hey. Bravo Team
reporting for duty, ma'am.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.093
SONNY:
Yeah.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.660
Glad you guys
made it in okay.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.010
Tell you what, you always
take us to the nicest places.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.838
Let's not keep you here
long, then.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.361
That's all right, we're ready
to go when you're ready to go.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.973
Plan is still the same.
Fast-rope and the helo standby.

27:07.016 --> 27:08.801
On standby. Just
came to let you know

27:08.844 --> 27:10.716
we're waiting on some
intel from a C.I.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.152
Settle down.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.197
Just need five minutes.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.330
All right, let's go.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.940
Jock up. Let's move.
We don't want

27:17.984 --> 27:19.420
to be here longer than
we have to. Come on.

27:21.465 --> 27:24.338
Hey, sorry I, uh, didn't make
it to hang out the other night.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.253
Yeah, you know,
I figured you're too busy

27:26.296 --> 27:28.951
draining the swamp in D.C.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.953
Dude, why do you have such
a problem with Rebecca?

27:30.997 --> 27:33.434
[chuckles]
Well, I figure she's got

27:33.477 --> 27:36.393
quite the short leash
on you, buddy.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.744
With the way you were
sneaking around for Davis,

27:38.787 --> 27:41.442
not sure I'd be comparing
leash sizes there, pal.

27:41.485 --> 27:44.619
Well, listen, pal,
I was protecting her, okay?

27:44.663 --> 27:48.057
Least I didn't, uh,
lose who I was.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.625
You're saying I have?

27:50.669 --> 27:53.672
I just think you like playing

27:53.715 --> 27:57.153
Mr. Spenser Goes to Washington a little too much.

27:57.197 --> 27:59.155
You open your mouth
way too damn much.

27:59.199 --> 28:00.940
Oh, really?
Did I strike a nerve?JASON: Hey, hey, hey!

28:00.983 --> 28:02.811
Get your heads in the game.

28:02.855 --> 28:05.031
Seen that look before.
It's not good.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.468
MANDY: My C.I. reports the area
surrounding the holding facility

28:07.511 --> 28:09.122
is crawling with VSP.

28:09.165 --> 28:11.559
Death squad must be assisting
with the transfer.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.561
We're undermanned and outgunned.

28:13.604 --> 28:16.042
What do you think, brother?

28:16.085 --> 28:18.609
I think our op just got canked.
That's what I think.

28:25.529 --> 28:27.314
Thanks to Mandy's C.I.,
here's what we know.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.619
Gate stays closed.

28:28.663 --> 28:29.925
Two guards out front
instead of one.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.144
Only people
allowed in and out

28:31.187 --> 28:33.581
are VSP patrols
in the neighborhood.

28:33.624 --> 28:34.974
Probably 'cause they're planning
to move the prisoners.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.149
MANDY:
Dr. Craig reported

28:36.192 --> 28:37.759
that Ramos
and the other hostages

28:37.803 --> 28:39.543
are being held in the east wing

28:39.587 --> 28:41.894
with half a dozen
guards present.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.939
Well, Dr. Craig kept us
from walking into a goat rope.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.072
[sighs]
Yeah, well, helo insert's out.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.551
You don't want to draw
that kind of attention,

28:47.595 --> 28:49.118
get into a big-ass gunfight.Mm-hmm.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.077
What about ISR?Yeah.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.166
It'd feel a lot better
with someone watching our six

28:53.209 --> 28:54.776
with that death
squad on top of us.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.386
It's not exactly a Predator,

28:56.430 --> 28:58.388
but it has an hour
of flight time

28:58.432 --> 29:00.216
and will at least give us eyes
on the facility.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.001
So, we're planning on taking

29:02.044 --> 29:05.439
the horsemen of the apocalypse
on with a toy plane.

29:05.482 --> 29:08.181
ERIC: Right, Jace,
what do you think?

29:08.224 --> 29:11.097
Well, don't have enough
guns to overrun them.

29:11.140 --> 29:14.013
Don't have enough time
to come up with something

29:14.056 --> 29:15.492
to, uh, get under their noses,

29:15.536 --> 29:18.060
so I say we just hide
in plain sight.

29:18.104 --> 29:21.760
VSP masks should give us
the cover we need.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.110
Look, I'm all
for playing dress-up

29:24.153 --> 29:25.241
and keeping things fresh,

29:25.285 --> 29:27.809
but posing
as the Venezuelan death squad

29:27.853 --> 29:29.115
doesn't exactly get
my engine running.

29:29.158 --> 29:30.333
Okay. That's great, Sonny,

29:30.377 --> 29:31.770
but we're gonna wear the masks,
all right?

29:31.813 --> 29:32.901
Put them on.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.908
[Ray clears throat]

29:39.952 --> 29:42.519
That phone gonna help us
avoid the VSP?

29:42.563 --> 29:44.521
[sighs]

29:44.565 --> 29:47.133
What's up with you, man?Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.439
You been hangdogging it
since we were wheels up.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.267
Now, if you got
something in your head,

29:51.311 --> 29:53.356
you need to clear it
out now before we roll.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.184
All right, you're right.
You know what?

29:55.228 --> 29:56.795
Natalie, she met Emma.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.058
Ah, worlds collided.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.755
Right. They collided,

30:00.799 --> 30:02.322
but I didn't tell Emma
about Natalie.

30:02.365 --> 30:05.151
I'm sure it'll smooth over.It's not gonna smooth over.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.806
Come on, you know this.
What is it, something like 85%

30:07.849 --> 30:10.112
of the relationships
in teams fail?

30:10.156 --> 30:11.940
My marriage failed.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.682
I isolated Alana.
I shut her out.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.205
She didn't deserve that.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.338
What are you getting at,
brother?[exhales]

30:18.381 --> 30:20.949
I'm getting at
is the stats show,

30:20.993 --> 30:23.256
right, that me and Natalie
are gonna blow up.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.998
That's what it shows.
She doesn't deserve that.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.175
Could happen, yeah.[exhales]

30:29.218 --> 30:31.525
But honestly, Jason,
right now it sounds like

30:31.568 --> 30:32.874
you're the one pulling the pin.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.833
Look, I'm gonna need you
to focus up, boss dog.

1:01:27.205 --> 1:01:29.337
to attempt a rescue
of Dr. Craig.

1:01:29.381 --> 1:01:31.252
That a call you'd make?

1:01:31.296 --> 1:01:33.515
[sighs]

1:01:33.559 --> 1:01:35.300
Well...

1:01:35.343 --> 1:01:36.954
making the call
is not the problem.

1:01:36.997 --> 1:01:38.433
It's living with it's
the hard part.

1:01:38.477 --> 1:01:41.872
Is there a particular call
that's weighing on you?

1:01:41.915 --> 1:01:44.701
Still think
I should've stood for Davis

1:01:44.744 --> 1:01:46.528
at her disciplinary review.

1:01:46.572 --> 1:01:48.530
VIC:
Yeah, she got off, though.

1:01:48.574 --> 1:01:50.489
And you didn't have
to ding your career.

1:01:50.532 --> 1:01:51.969
It's a win-win, right?

1:01:52.012 --> 1:01:53.535
I would say so.

1:01:53.579 --> 1:01:56.887
It's all about picking
your battles, man.

1:01:56.930 --> 1:01:58.889
I picked wrong on that one.

1:01:58.932 --> 1:02:02.196
It's the last time I put my own
interests over what's right.

1:02:05.896 --> 1:02:08.289
[men speaking Spanish]JASON: That's gonna
give us a drone feed?

1:02:08.333 --> 1:02:09.856
Well, as soon as I link it up.

1:02:14.078 --> 1:02:16.384
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:02:16.428 --> 1:02:17.995
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy. Come on.

1:02:18.038 --> 1:02:19.648
I got you.[sighs]

1:02:19.692 --> 1:02:20.867
You okay?Yeah. No, I'm fine.

1:02:20.911 --> 1:02:22.477
Shh, shh. Hey, hey,
look at me.

1:02:22.521 --> 1:02:25.567
Just breathe. Trent? Trent?I'm fine. I'm...

1:02:25.611 --> 1:02:27.047
She almost passed out. Just
take a look at her, all right?

1:02:27.091 --> 1:02:28.875
Yeah. Come with me.
I'll have a look. Come on.Sonny?

1:02:28.919 --> 1:02:30.529
TRENT:
No, no, no, no, no.Everything okay?

1:02:30.572 --> 1:02:32.009
JASON: Yeah. Get in here.DAVIS: I just got to get this

1:02:32.052 --> 1:02:33.967
SATCOM-- get this SATCOM...No, no, we're fine. Got it.

1:02:34.011 --> 1:02:35.795
DAVIS: No, I just,
I got to, I have to...JASON: Stop. Stop!

1:02:35.839 --> 1:02:38.015
Sonny, get this thing
working, will you?

1:02:44.151 --> 1:02:46.110
The Agency only knew

1:02:46.153 --> 1:02:48.721
of the one holding facility
where they had us.

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:51.289
Uh...

1:02:51.332 --> 1:02:53.639
No idea where they might
have taken Dr. Craig.

1:02:55.380 --> 1:02:56.903
Okay, so, who would?

1:02:56.947 --> 1:03:00.211
Who can we lean on?

1:03:00.254 --> 1:03:04.737
See, I had value because they
suspected me of being CIA,

1:03:04.781 --> 1:03:09.524
but I'm not sure what they
would want with a Brit.

1:03:09.568 --> 1:03:11.570
Well, the fact that
they didn't leave Dr. Craig

1:03:11.613 --> 1:03:14.355
for dead tells me
that someone had a use for him.

1:03:14.399 --> 1:03:16.488
The question is: who?

1:03:17.576 --> 1:03:20.231
There was one VSP lieutenant
in there

1:03:20.274 --> 1:03:23.538
who would talk to me a bit--
Cabrera.

1:03:23.582 --> 1:03:26.759
He seemed to be fed up
with the unit's tactics.

1:03:26.803 --> 1:03:28.021
Vulnerable?

1:03:28.065 --> 1:03:31.633
Eh, at least a glimmer
of a conscience.

1:03:31.677 --> 1:03:34.245
He carried some guilt
over losing his wife.

1:03:34.288 --> 1:03:35.986
If I hadn't been
chained to the wall,

1:03:36.029 --> 1:03:37.596
I might've tried to turn him.

1:03:37.639 --> 1:03:40.381
Do you think he would
know where Dr. Craig is?

1:03:40.425 --> 1:03:43.558
Well, high ranking enough
to be in the loop.

1:03:43.602 --> 1:03:44.864
Find him.

1:03:44.908 --> 1:03:47.127
You could ask him.

1:03:47.171 --> 1:03:48.955
You remember how you got
here from the safe house?

1:03:48.999 --> 1:03:50.652
Orange Land Cruiser.

1:03:50.696 --> 1:03:53.003
Did you lose consciousness
when you were attacked?

1:03:53.046 --> 1:03:54.482
No.

1:03:54.526 --> 1:03:56.441
What about since then?Also no. And since

1:03:56.484 --> 1:03:58.704
I know you're about to ask if
I remember what happened before,

1:03:58.747 --> 1:04:00.271
I confirmed the helo extract,

1:04:00.314 --> 1:04:02.229
I grabbed the hard drives,
and I thermited the terminals.

1:04:02.273 --> 1:04:03.840
I told you, I'm fine.

1:04:03.883 --> 1:04:06.364
Except for the, uh, dizzy
spell in the other room.

1:04:06.407 --> 1:04:07.931
Or would you call that
a loss of balance?

1:04:07.974 --> 1:04:10.716
CLAY:
Either way, it puts you
on concussion protocol.

1:04:10.759 --> 1:04:12.674
Cocktail time?

1:04:12.718 --> 1:04:14.676
Magnesium.

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:16.765
Hydration will help
stave off symptoms.

1:04:16.809 --> 1:04:18.811
Needle coming in.

1:04:23.076 --> 1:04:24.382
You good?

1:04:24.425 --> 1:04:25.949
I'm fine!

1:04:25.992 --> 1:04:28.038
Put it out over comms,
so everybody stops asking me.

1:04:28.081 --> 1:04:29.691
Well, you're all set.

1:04:29.735 --> 1:04:30.692
But if you have a
headache or anything...

1:04:30.736 --> 1:04:32.259
let me know.

1:04:32.303 --> 1:04:33.739
Yes, sir.

1:04:33.782 --> 1:04:35.959
You're welcome.

1:04:37.917 --> 1:04:39.876
Thank you.

1:04:44.141 --> 1:04:45.403
All right.

1:04:45.446 --> 1:04:46.708
Just hang here
and take it easy.

1:04:46.752 --> 1:04:48.145
Not a chance.
I got to help us figure out

1:04:48.188 --> 1:04:49.320
how to get out of this mess.

1:04:49.363 --> 1:04:50.495
You're seriously
just as stubborn

1:04:50.538 --> 1:04:51.757
as the first day
I met you.

1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:52.932
You remember
you tried to bite

1:04:52.976 --> 1:04:54.586
my head off for asking
for a hammock.

1:04:54.629 --> 1:04:55.935
Not exactly how I remember it.

1:04:55.979 --> 1:04:57.763
Oh, you see?

1:04:57.806 --> 1:04:59.765
You do have a concussion.

1:05:01.245 --> 1:05:02.724
You need anything else from me?

1:05:02.768 --> 1:05:04.117
That's a really
generous offer coming

1:05:04.161 --> 1:05:05.945
from someone who looks pretty
banged up himself.

1:05:05.989 --> 1:05:07.642
I'm all good.

1:05:07.686 --> 1:05:09.818
Be in a body bag
if it weren't for Vic,

1:05:09.862 --> 1:05:11.777
but...

1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:14.388
you know, everybody needs
a little help sometimes.

1:05:14.432 --> 1:05:16.086
That's why
we're a team.

1:05:16.129 --> 1:05:18.479
I know, it...

1:05:18.523 --> 1:05:20.525
just seems like
when the chips were down,

1:05:20.568 --> 1:05:22.788
I wasn't an asset, I was a...

1:05:22.831 --> 1:05:24.398
drain on resources.

1:05:24.442 --> 1:05:26.052
You are an asset.

1:05:26.096 --> 1:05:27.532
Always.

1:05:27.575 --> 1:05:29.621
And that's why we're
all here checking up on you.

1:05:29.664 --> 1:05:31.188
All right, so if you
get a headache...

1:05:31.231 --> 1:05:32.972
This conversation is

1:05:33.016 --> 1:05:34.321
going to give me one
if it goes on

1:05:34.365 --> 1:05:36.236
much longer.

1:05:36.280 --> 1:05:38.369
Okay, okay.
Thank you.

1:05:43.113 --> 1:05:44.984
Either got a drone feed

1:05:45.028 --> 1:05:46.986
or Slovakian reruns
of The A-Team.

1:05:47.030 --> 1:05:49.989
Not sure I did it right.

1:05:50.033 --> 1:05:51.556
We got the drone feed.

1:05:51.599 --> 1:05:53.471
Long-range comms
are back up, too.

1:05:53.514 --> 1:05:55.560
Ooh, my work is done here.

1:05:55.603 --> 1:05:57.257
Call me MacGyver.

1:05:57.301 --> 1:05:59.433
Stop, all right?It's a real lead, Jason.

1:05:59.477 --> 1:06:01.435
Okay, look-- I understand that.A chance to find Dr. Craig.

1:06:01.479 --> 1:06:03.176
But we're not supposed to be in
this country, and you want us

1:06:03.220 --> 1:06:05.222
to what, just knock on the door
of some VSP lieutenant?

1:06:05.265 --> 1:06:06.875
Is that what
you want us to do?
All right,

1:06:06.919 --> 1:06:08.355
what's this I hear about
knocking on the enemy's door?

1:06:08.399 --> 1:06:09.791
JASON:
Go ahead.

1:06:09.835 --> 1:06:11.271
There's a VSP lieutenant

1:06:11.315 --> 1:06:13.360
who might know
where they took Dr. Craig.

1:06:13.404 --> 1:06:15.188
Ramos thinks he might
be sympathetic.

1:06:15.232 --> 1:06:16.494
We're playing beyond injured

1:06:16.537 --> 1:06:18.104
and you want to throw
a Hail Mary?

1:06:18.148 --> 1:06:19.366
MANDY:
I have his home address.

1:06:19.410 --> 1:06:20.498
We have ISR, we've got comms,

1:06:20.541 --> 1:06:22.065
there's a couple hours
before extract.

1:06:22.108 --> 1:06:24.023
That is not much time
to get him to cooperate.

1:06:24.067 --> 1:06:26.547
Get this guy in front of me,
he'll talk.

1:06:28.288 --> 1:06:30.377
It's your call, Jace.

1:06:30.421 --> 1:06:33.380
Dr. Craig's life depends on us.

1:06:33.424 --> 1:06:36.993
One last shot, one.

1:06:37.036 --> 1:06:38.559
That's it.

1:06:44.783 --> 1:06:46.306
Mandy's friends back
in Langley have come through

1:06:46.350 --> 1:06:48.917
with our target package--
VSP Officer Cesar Cabrera.

1:06:48.961 --> 1:06:50.658
He lives in this
apartment complex

1:06:50.702 --> 1:06:51.877
in the Montalbán region.

1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:55.272
Area looks quiet.

1:06:55.315 --> 1:06:56.838
Shouldn't be
that many eyes on us

1:06:56.882 --> 1:06:58.057
with the citywide curfew.

1:06:58.101 --> 1:06:59.711
Violent totalitarian regime
with the assist.

1:06:59.754 --> 1:07:02.061
Also in our favor,
Cabrera's neighborhood has

1:07:02.105 --> 1:07:03.976
minimal police activity,

1:07:04.020 --> 1:07:05.543
so we shouldn't expect
any resistance.Well, we can't

1:07:05.586 --> 1:07:07.588
afford any-- we're closing in
on our extract window.

1:07:07.632 --> 1:07:09.416
Two hours out.That's it.

1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:11.810
So, any whiff of complication,
we cank the op, got it?

1:07:11.853 --> 1:07:14.987
Here's some petty cash, in case
Cabrera needs some motivation.

1:07:15.031 --> 1:07:17.076

The rest, let's load up.

I should hang back.

Gather up the ammo, prep
for another follow-up.

1:07:22.212 --> 1:07:23.778
Yeah, that sounds good.

1:07:23.822 --> 1:07:25.911
Trent, take his place.
Roll with us.

1:07:25.954 --> 1:07:28.174

I'd say this, but I'm not sure

1:07:28.218 --> 1:07:29.915
I want mission success
on this one.

1:07:29.958 --> 1:07:31.569
You know what,
Mandy's got a lead.

1:07:31.612 --> 1:07:34.528
We owe it to her
to chase it down.

1:07:34.572 --> 1:07:36.095
Yeah, but if she pries
a location from this guy,

1:07:36.139 --> 1:07:37.662

1:07:40.882 --> 1:07:42.667
It's all right, we'll figure it
out when we get there.

Are expecting me to report
for duty in the next 20 minutos.

1:09:44.092 --> 1:09:46.399
If I am not there,

1:09:46.443 --> 1:09:48.184
they will come here.

1:09:48.227 --> 1:09:49.707
Are you prepared for that?

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:51.317
You're lying, Cesar.
Nobody's coming.

1:09:51.361 --> 1:09:53.928
We have all the
time we need.

1:09:59.282 --> 1:10:00.935
[knocking]

1:10:00.979 --> 1:10:04.852
You know, uh,
typically, we push

1:10:04.896 --> 1:10:07.333
the rifle barrel away
with our hands and...

1:10:07.377 --> 1:10:08.943
not our head.

1:10:10.728 --> 1:10:12.860
[chuckles]
You know, I, uh,

1:10:12.904 --> 1:10:16.299
I really wish I
was there, Davis.

1:10:16.342 --> 1:10:19.519
We had just gotten to the
safe house ten minutes sooner.

1:10:19.563 --> 1:10:21.129
It's not your job.

1:10:21.173 --> 1:10:22.914
It's on me
to have my back.

1:10:22.957 --> 1:10:25.090
No, everybody's
got to have their

1:10:25.133 --> 1:10:27.223
six covered
from time to time.

1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:34.273
You got to ease up on yourself.

1:10:34.317 --> 1:10:37.581
You know, I thought
I was gonna die, Sonny.

1:10:39.191 --> 1:10:41.237
Right there
on the floor.

1:10:44.109 --> 1:10:46.720
I swear to you...

1:10:46.764 --> 1:10:49.897
I would've burned
this city to the ground.

1:10:49.941 --> 1:10:53.249
This is all I could find.

1:10:53.292 --> 1:10:54.467
Oh, cool.

1:10:54.511 --> 1:10:56.513
It'll do.

1:11:01.213 --> 1:11:04.825
Dr. Craig came here to help
your people, Cesar.

1:11:04.869 --> 1:11:06.566
To save Venezuela's
sick and poor.

1:11:06.610 --> 1:11:08.089
And he deserves
to go home!

1:11:08.133 --> 1:11:09.874
Told you, I don't know
about a doctor.

1:11:09.917 --> 1:11:12.224
Any second, officers are gonna
be here looking for me.

1:11:12.268 --> 1:11:14.226
We got to end this.
We're burning time, come on.

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:16.141
He knows
where Dr. Craig is.

1:11:16.184 --> 1:11:17.925
Of course he does, Mandy.
Of course he does, all right?

1:11:17.969 --> 1:11:19.492
Here's the thing, he's
more afraid of the VSP

1:11:19.536 --> 1:11:22.278
than he is of us,
that's why.

1:11:22.321 --> 1:11:23.583
Not giving in.

1:11:23.627 --> 1:11:25.106
What's one more body
down here?

1:11:25.150 --> 1:11:26.586
Where is Dr. Craig?

1:11:26.630 --> 1:11:28.806
Where?!

1:11:28.849 --> 1:11:32.723
[speaking Spanish]

1:11:35.203 --> 1:11:36.248
We got to go.

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:37.989
Is that your wife?

1:11:41.079 --> 1:11:42.123
CABRERA:
A memory now.

1:11:45.475 --> 1:11:48.695
Why do you need
her forgiveness?

1:11:48.739 --> 1:11:50.218
You lost so much.

1:11:50.262 --> 1:11:52.177
Your loved ones,
your country.

1:11:52.220 --> 1:11:55.223
The tide of death down here
must be so overwhelming.

1:11:55.267 --> 1:11:57.704
Easy to lose
yourself in it.

1:12:00.751 --> 1:12:02.143
[sighs]

1:12:04.189 --> 1:12:07.061
The man I'm trying to save...

1:12:07.105 --> 1:12:09.586
he never asked for any of this.

1:12:09.629 --> 1:12:12.240
He's a force for good,

1:12:12.284 --> 1:12:14.025
for healing.

1:12:14.068 --> 1:12:16.288
And he's paying
for my sins.

1:12:18.246 --> 1:12:22.381
I am asking you, Cesar,
for a chance to atone.

1:12:26.298 --> 1:12:28.605
They call it "The Mill."

1:12:30.563 --> 1:12:33.349
It's where we dropped off
those we wanted to break.

1:12:34.785 --> 1:12:37.222
The others would do it for us.

1:12:37.265 --> 1:12:40.225
"Others"?

1:12:40.268 --> 1:12:42.270
The foreigners.

1:12:42.314 --> 1:12:44.142
They wanted to take
hostages with them.

1:12:44.185 --> 1:12:45.752
Hezbollah?

1:12:45.796 --> 1:12:47.885
They're sending them
to the Middle East?

1:12:47.928 --> 1:12:51.279
Western doctors are
valuable to them.

1:12:51.323 --> 1:12:55.022
They-they won't keep them
in this country much longer.

1:13:04.162 --> 1:13:05.816
So, the doctors are
in Hezbollah custody?

1:13:05.859 --> 1:13:07.644
We knew they had a presence
here; they're trying to leverage

1:13:07.687 --> 1:13:10.647
the chaos for their
criminal activities.

1:13:10.690 --> 1:13:12.431
Uh, look, the facility
they have, The Mill,

1:13:12.475 --> 1:13:13.911
is it an interrogation facility?

1:13:13.954 --> 1:13:15.652
Pain factory.

1:13:15.695 --> 1:13:17.567
Westerners are a huge coup
for Hezbollah,

1:13:17.610 --> 1:13:19.482
so we can assume they're still
alive, but they'll be trafficked

1:13:19.525 --> 1:13:21.135
east as soon as possible.

1:13:21.179 --> 1:13:23.181
Extract helos just confirmed
they're inbound.

1:13:23.224 --> 1:13:24.443
Hour out.

1:13:24.487 --> 1:13:25.792
The Mill's in the same direction

1:13:25.836 --> 1:13:27.403
as the extract point.

1:13:27.446 --> 1:13:28.708
It's just a few miles off.

1:13:28.752 --> 1:13:31.189
This would be a zero-intel
hit on an unknown

1:13:31.232 --> 1:13:32.799
number of combatants

1:13:32.843 --> 1:13:35.149
in a setting that
we know nothing about.

1:13:35.193 --> 1:13:37.674
I'm not sure
Bravo's squared away

1:13:37.717 --> 1:13:39.502
for something
like this right now.

1:13:39.545 --> 1:13:41.678
Dr. Craig kept our asses
out of the fire.

1:13:41.721 --> 1:13:43.723
You know the boys'll charge it
for him if you point the way.

1:13:43.767 --> 1:13:45.551
No doubt about that,

1:13:45.595 --> 1:13:47.814
but I got to draw
a line somewhere.

1:13:47.858 --> 1:13:51.252
Pack up. Move to
extract in 30 mikes.

1:13:51.296 --> 1:13:52.732
Roger that.

1:14:07.443 --> 1:14:08.661
Sorry, I didn't mean

1:14:08.705 --> 1:14:10.402
to scare you.What are you doing?

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:11.664
[sighs]

1:14:11.708 --> 1:14:13.840
I, uh, wanted to talk to you.

1:14:15.451 --> 1:14:17.148
Look, Blackburn
already saved me,

1:14:17.191 --> 1:14:19.019
Trent medicated me,
and Clay pep-talked me,

1:14:19.063 --> 1:14:20.934
so why don't you just
save your energy.

1:14:22.370 --> 1:14:24.808
It feels like we're all
getting tested down here, right?

1:14:24.851 --> 1:14:26.853
In my case, literally.

1:14:26.897 --> 1:14:29.290
And the guy
marking my grade

1:14:29.334 --> 1:14:31.641
has a three-inch chunk of steel
stuck in his leg.

1:14:31.684 --> 1:14:33.599
Doubt that earns me
extra credit.

1:14:33.643 --> 1:14:35.383
Look, Mack didn't get
hurt on your watch.

1:14:35.427 --> 1:14:36.776
They can't hold
that against you.

1:14:37.864 --> 1:14:39.953
Truth is, Lisa...

1:14:39.997 --> 1:14:42.303
I've been way too concerned
with how...

1:14:42.347 --> 1:14:44.349
I look to the Warrant Board.

1:14:44.392 --> 1:14:47.352
I owe you an apology.
No. I...
Ray, don't.

1:14:47.395 --> 1:14:49.267
I should've stood for you
after your arrest.

1:14:49.310 --> 1:14:50.703
I didn't, and I am sorry.

1:14:50.747 --> 1:14:52.531
You think that's
what I want to hear?
No.

1:14:52.575 --> 1:14:54.011
No, it's just the truth.

1:14:55.099 --> 1:14:56.753
I made the wrong call.

1:14:56.796 --> 1:15:00.365
Look, lot of complications come
with following a new path.

1:15:00.408 --> 1:15:01.497
I get it.

1:15:02.889 --> 1:15:05.762
Yeah, I think I'm starting
to find that out now.

1:15:09.983 --> 1:15:11.071
Are we good?

1:15:11.115 --> 1:15:13.073
You were doing what you thought

1:15:13.117 --> 1:15:14.858
was best for your family.

1:15:14.901 --> 1:15:16.033
We're good.

1:15:18.078 --> 1:15:19.819
We're moving to exfil.

1:15:19.863 --> 1:15:22.909
I got some things to... do.

1:15:25.521 --> 1:15:27.131
Yes, ma'am.

1:15:33.137 --> 1:15:36.096
Look, I know you're angry--
I understand it-- but, um,

1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:38.359
we did everything that we could.

1:15:38.403 --> 1:15:41.406
Team's injured.
It's running on fumes.

1:15:41.449 --> 1:15:43.539
I know. I know.

1:15:45.366 --> 1:15:49.022
Dr. Craig's the newest name
on my list.

1:15:49.066 --> 1:15:51.242
Your list? What's that?

1:15:52.548 --> 1:15:55.072
You have contacts
on your phone.

1:15:55.115 --> 1:15:58.989
I have a list of people
I've crossed paths with--

1:15:59.032 --> 1:16:01.818
sources, colleagues, friends,
people who

1:16:01.861 --> 1:16:04.516
grow close to me

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:08.564
because they think I have
their best interests at heart.

1:16:08.607 --> 1:16:11.479
People who inevitably get hurt

1:16:11.523 --> 1:16:14.091
for trusting me.

1:16:14.134 --> 1:16:16.920
I have my share
of collateral damage, too.

1:16:20.184 --> 1:16:21.402
Mm.

1:16:23.056 --> 1:16:25.581
It's getting harder
to justify the...

1:16:25.624 --> 1:16:28.192
people who are getting hurt
around us.

1:16:28.235 --> 1:16:30.455
They add up,
don't they?

1:16:32.675 --> 1:16:36.113
Here I was hoping...

1:16:36.156 --> 1:16:40.160
we'd get to make
just one of those right.

1:16:45.818 --> 1:16:47.777
Blackburn.

1:16:47.820 --> 1:16:50.127
Round 'em up.

1:16:50.170 --> 1:16:52.129
All right, so,
this is the building

1:16:52.172 --> 1:16:54.392
where we believe they're
holding the doctors.

1:16:54.435 --> 1:16:56.786
I had a feeling Bravo wasn't
leaving without an encore.

1:16:56.829 --> 1:16:59.397
Yep. And we're gonna be
stripped down, fast and dirty.

1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:02.226
The building we're hitting's
a disused three-story factory.

1:17:02.269 --> 1:17:04.924
Primary breach point's a door on
the green side of the building.

1:17:04.968 --> 1:17:07.579
What's our game plan, since
we don't know where they're
holding these hostages?

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:09.537
Clear from the basement up.

1:17:09.581 --> 1:17:11.583
Any combatants?DAVIS: External,

1:17:11.627 --> 1:17:12.932
I've only counted
a few on patrol.

1:17:12.976 --> 1:17:14.934
Internal, anybody's guess.

1:17:14.978 --> 1:17:17.502
Could be a mix
of VSP and Hezbollah.

1:17:17.545 --> 1:17:19.025
Sun's coming up in 15,

1:17:19.069 --> 1:17:20.940
so you won't have
the cover of darkness.

1:17:20.984 --> 1:17:22.681
Got a jury-rigged TOC.

1:17:22.725 --> 1:17:25.597
What's our plan
for loss of comms?Helo landing zone's

1:17:25.641 --> 1:17:27.164
been plugged into
all your GPSs.

1:17:27.207 --> 1:17:29.427
If we lose comms, get
to the extract point.

1:17:29.470 --> 1:17:31.081
Yeah, not if,when.

1:17:31.124 --> 1:17:33.083
We got 30 minutes till
we have to unplug here.

1:17:33.126 --> 1:17:34.606
After that, you'll
be on your own.

1:17:34.650 --> 1:17:36.347
All right, look, these guys
are not gonna be expecting

1:17:36.390 --> 1:17:37.696
another fight from us.Good.

1:17:37.740 --> 1:17:40.177
Got surprise on our side.Yeah.

1:17:40.220 --> 1:17:41.482
That's about all we got
on our side.

1:17:42.483 --> 1:17:44.834
Feast your eyes
on slim pickings, boys.

1:17:44.877 --> 1:17:46.313
[sighs]

1:17:51.710 --> 1:17:53.930
All right, look, I know
I'm asking a lot on this one.

1:17:53.973 --> 1:17:55.279
We're beat up.
We're injured.

1:17:55.322 --> 1:17:56.497
With the sun coming up,

1:17:56.541 --> 1:17:58.935
tactically, we're really
going up against it.

1:17:58.978 --> 1:18:00.588
So I need to know now.

1:18:00.632 --> 1:18:02.590
If anyone has an
issue with this,

1:18:02.634 --> 1:18:04.418
they got to speak up now.

1:18:04.462 --> 1:18:05.724
That's a strong copy, 1.

1:18:05.768 --> 1:18:07.770
Dr. Craig's life is
in our hands.

1:18:07.813 --> 1:18:09.772
Going for him is
the right call.

1:18:09.815 --> 1:18:13.601
Yeah. Got no cake-eaters playing
geopolitical chess on this op.

1:18:13.645 --> 1:18:16.256
Saving the guy who put his life
on the line is an easy call.

1:18:16.300 --> 1:18:18.781
And Bravo, we never run
from a fight.

1:18:18.824 --> 1:18:20.217
Let's get 'er done.

1:18:20.260 --> 1:18:22.088
All right, dig in.
Two mags each.

1:18:22.132 --> 1:18:23.786
Let's roll.

1:18:27.267 --> 1:18:28.660
Bravo 5,
we're two mikes out.

1:18:28.704 --> 1:18:29.966
Everyone conserve
your rounds,

1:18:30.009 --> 1:18:31.619
make them count.SONNY:
Lower on ammo

1:18:31.663 --> 1:18:33.404
than a neutered dog.

1:18:33.447 --> 1:18:35.623
I can't remember being
this Winchester'd.

1:18:35.667 --> 1:18:37.408
Chechnya, 2010.

1:18:37.451 --> 1:18:39.497
Practically checking
the seat cushions
for spare rounds.

1:18:39.540 --> 1:18:41.629
70 hours
of sustained combat.

1:18:41.673 --> 1:18:44.807
I still haven't gotten
Full Metal out of my
nostrils after that one.

1:18:44.850 --> 1:18:46.591
Here we go,
couple of bullfrogs

1:18:46.634 --> 1:18:49.507
in the good old days
in the pond.

1:18:49.550 --> 1:18:52.640
Well, well, I feel
a second wind coming on.

1:18:52.684 --> 1:18:54.730
That's cutting it too close.

1:18:54.773 --> 1:18:57.558
They're almost at target.Good.

1:18:57.602 --> 1:19:01.519
Sun's up. There's gonna be
a lot of eyes with it.

1:19:01.562 --> 1:19:04.609
Bravo 1, the next right is
a street headed to target.

1:19:04.652 --> 1:19:07.525
I'm seeing two armed combatants
near the front entrance.

1:19:07.568 --> 1:19:09.440
Copy that, Havoc.

1:19:13.749 --> 1:19:15.663
We got a tail, brother.

1:19:21.147 --> 1:19:22.801
Yeah, and these guys
do not look like
