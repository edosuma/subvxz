00:15.783 --> 00:17.785
Except your underpants.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.688
How long have you been here?

00:20.721 --> 00:21.889

00:23.157 --> 00:24.658
You should be at work.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.327
I'm taking the day off.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.961
No, you should be at work.

00:27.995 --> 00:31.332
You're sick all the time,
not just after hours.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.833
Shaun, you shouldn't
give up your life.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.768
You have my number.
You check in with me.

00:34.802 --> 00:38.939
I have 15 paid vacation days
and 10 sick days per year,

00:38.972 --> 00:40.841
but I can only
take sick days
when I'm sick,

00:40.874 --> 00:43.177
not when you are,
so this is a vacation.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.946
(SIGHS)

00:45.979 --> 00:47.348
The plan is
to align your eyes

00:47.381 --> 00:50.384
using what's called
distraction osteogenesis.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.186
We cut the bone
and implant posts

00:52.220 --> 00:54.988
on either side
of your eye orbits.

00:55.022 --> 00:58.159
Then we slowly expand
that distance,

00:58.192 --> 01:01.162
allowing for new bone
to grow in the gaps.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.663
MOLLY: Will it hurt?

01:02.696 --> 01:04.965
Mmm, for mere mortals
it would,

01:04.998 --> 01:08.001
but with your
pain tolerance,
it'll tickle.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.537
You up for this?

01:11.038 --> 01:12.840
So I'll have
perfectly aligned eyes

01:12.873 --> 01:14.875
but still look like
a wad of chewing gum.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.977

01:17.010 --> 01:20.114
You lost an awful lot
of bone and soft tissue
in the accident,

01:20.148 --> 01:22.183
and in terms of
facial reconstruction,

01:22.216 --> 01:24.418
we've actually come a long way
in the past two years.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.856

02:23.010 --> 02:24.612

02:26.480 --> 02:28.382

any major brain bleeds

In this case,
the heart trumps the head.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.523
Okay.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.262
I have two major symptoms,

02:41.295 --> 02:43.497
nausea and boredom.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.800
I didn't know boredom was
a symptom of chemotherapy.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.271
It's a symptom of
sitting on my ass all day.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.341
I used to run
a 700-bed hospital

02:53.374 --> 02:54.942
with a staff of thousands.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.946
Now all I have to think about
is how I keep my food down

02:58.979 --> 03:01.415
and how many bowel movements
I've had all week.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.351

about her,

15:22.189 --> 15:23.723
it made you happy.

all the time.

you felt a rush,

30:49.515 --> 30:50.950
About what?

30:50.983 --> 30:52.919
You're the one who insisted
we deal with the heart
before the brain.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.954
And you didn't fight me.
Why not?

30:54.987 --> 30:57.089
Because you were right.
I was right.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.959
But you have never thought
anyone other than yourself
was right in an OR

30:59.992 --> 31:01.928
since you first
stepped foot in one.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.263
You backed off 'cause
we're sleeping together.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.377
The car accident
was my fault.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.847
It was my idea
to leave so early.

31:22.949 --> 31:25.051
It was my idea
to let her sleep
in the back.

31:26.852 --> 31:29.488
It was up to me to make sure
she was wearing her seatbelt.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.725
CLAIRE: None of which
would've mattered

31:33.759 --> 31:35.995
if the truck driver
hadn't fallen asleep.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.565
It's natural to feel guilt,

31:39.598 --> 31:42.101
but you have to understand
this wasn't your fault.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.172
It doesn't work that way,
Dr. Browne.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.609
It was my handgun
that hurt Molly.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.013
And you can say that
it was a freak accident

31:54.046 --> 31:57.083
or that Molly knew
she wasn't supposed
to touch it

31:57.116 --> 31:58.884
or some other BS,

31:59.952 --> 32:01.420
but it was my fault.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.523
I had one job,

32:06.792 --> 32:08.694
and that was
to protect my family.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.298
I didn't do my job.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.202
And you could try
to make sense of it,

32:16.235 --> 32:19.705

some pleasure somewhere,

32:19.738 --> 32:21.273
some meaning.

For what I wrote
in your yearbook.

what you wrote in mine.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)
I certainly
remember that.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.551
Yeah, well,
it was a long time ago.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.821
Anyway, I just...
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

It is complicated.

The fact that
we're seeing each other

changes the context
