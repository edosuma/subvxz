08:16.996 --> 08:19.540
{\an1}- Yeah.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.876
<i>- These artists really have to</i>
<i>have a plan to work together,</i>

08:21.959 --> 08:24.503
so everybody tattooing
on the team needs to tattoo

08:24.587 --> 08:26.047
<i>up to the same level.</i>

08:26.130 --> 08:27.673
- We need a couple
of people to design.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.926
We definitely need
to decide on who can outline.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.220
{\an1}- I'll pull clean-ass
[bleep] lines all day, so...

08:32.303 --> 08:34.263
- You guys as a team
are gonna decide,

08:34.347 --> 08:35.431
because we're going
to win or lose as a team.

08:35.514 --> 08:36.890
{\an1}- Glad you guys got excited
about the saber-tooth.

08:36.974 --> 08:39.143
- Yeah.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.102
{\an8}- Oh, I really love
saber-toothed tiger pieces

08:41.187 --> 08:43.147
{\an8}in general, but trying
to find a bone structure

08:43.231 --> 08:45.816
{\an8}for an extinct animal could
totally screw us up on this.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.611
- The biggest thing is that
one person has to draw it.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.404
Because one person
draws each,

08:50.488 --> 08:51.572
they're already not
going to look the same.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.949
- Definitely.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.158
- So whether you guys
want to use your own machines,

08:54.242 --> 08:56.786
however your technique is,
we have to consider that

08:56.869 --> 08:59.080
everyone else is going to match
that technique and that look.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.832
- I mean, for my technique,
my black and gray is smooth.

09:01.916 --> 09:02.875
You've seen it.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.168
- You bring a lot
of blood to the surface.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.337
- You'll see, man.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.672
My black and gray
doesn't even get red.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.132
- He's Juan Salgado.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.218
<i>He's done everything.</i>
<i>He has all the awards.</i>

09:12.301 --> 09:13.803
{\an8}Well, right now
that doesn't matter,

09:13.886 --> 09:15.179
{\an8}because you do not
want to cooperate.

09:15.263 --> 09:18.099

in crouching and sneaking.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.824
from paper to skin,
on paper,

17:55.908 --> 17:57.076

<i>don't over-shade it</i>

18:13.467 --> 18:15.385
because it'll get muddy.
You can see it in the skull.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.512
<i>It's a little more buttery</i>
<i>than on the bones,</i>

18:16.595 --> 18:18.180

<i>just really no place</i>
