09:57.930 --> 09:59.693
HE'S BEEN ON SUPERVISED
HOME VISITS

09:59.730 --> 10:01.948
TO HIS SISTER'S FOR
WEEKS NOW WITHOUT INCIDENT.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.319
WITHOUT INCIDENT.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.099
WOMEN ARE BEING KILLED HERE.

10:09.970 --> 10:12.006
ALL OF THE FINGERS
FOUND IN REBECCA'S STOMACH

10:12.040 --> 10:14.838
ARE FROM THE SAME PERSON,
BUT THEY AREN'T HERS.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.771
SO WE HAVE ONE OTHER
UNKNOWN VICTIM.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.710
WELL, JJ AND GARCIA
ARE SEARCHING

10:20.750 --> 10:22.718
FOR OTHER MISSING WOMEN
WHO FIT HIS VICTIMOLGY.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.719
ALVEZ: YOU KNOW, THE FACT
THAT THE KILLER FORCED REBECCA

10:25.750 --> 10:28.116
TO SWALLOW THE FINGERS
OF A PRIOR VICTIM

10:28.160 --> 10:31.254
MEANS THAT HE MUST HAVE
HAD INSIDE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE OLD CASES.

10:31.290 --> 10:32.951
FERELL'S BEEN OUT ON
WEEKEND HOME VISITS,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.991
SO IT IS POSSIBLE
HE'S KILLING AGAIN.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.395
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'D BE THAT RECKLESS.

10:36.430 --> 10:37.863
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

10:37.900 --> 10:39.788
WELL, IT HAPPENED
WITH HINKLEY AND VINCE LI,

10:39.840 --> 10:42.331
THE CANNIBAL WHO KILLED
AND BEHEADED A GUY ON A BUS.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.406
SIMMONS: AND WHAT'S
WORSE, 'CAUSE THIS IS
A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE

10:44.440 --> 10:47.136
NOT A CRIMINAL CASE,
THEY HAD NO DUTY TO
TELL US OR THE PUBLIC.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.136
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT FERELL'S LAWYER,

10:49.180 --> 10:50.670
BILLIE WILLIAMS,
IS HERE.

10:50.710 --> 10:53.019
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO HEAR
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.846
IT'S FORTUNATE
THAT YOU'RE HERE, AGENTS.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.710
I WAS JUST TELLING
DETECTIVE RUSS

10:59.760 --> 11:01.318
ABOUT OUR LAWSUIT
AGAINST THE FBI.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.022
DON'T WASTE OUR TIME
WITH THREATS.
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.028
AS A COURTESY,
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

11:06.060 --> 11:08.153
THAT I JUST FILED A MOTION
TO DROP ALL CHARGES

11:08.200 --> 11:09.895
AGAINST MY CLIENT.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.921
I'M PETITIONING FOR
HIS UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE.

11:11.970 --> 11:13.267
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

11:13.300 --> 11:15.029
IT'S CLEAR
FROM THE CURRENT MURDER

11:15.070 --> 11:16.901
THAT FERELL
IS ACTUALLY INNOCENT.

11:16.940 --> 11:19.135
HE WAS SET UP
BY THE REAL KILLER
10 YEARS AGO

11:19.170 --> 11:20.774
AND THAT GUY'S
KILLING AGAIN.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.109
THE MURDERS STOPPED
AS SOON AS FERELL
WAS LOCKED UP,

11:24.150 --> 11:26.209
AND TH EY'VE STARTED AGAIN
NOW THAT HE'S ON
HOME RELEASE.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.275
SUPERVISED HOME RELEASE.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.039
AND IT'S FURTHER PROOF
THAT THE KILLER
IS SETI'ING MY CLIENT UP.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.751
HE ONLY KILLS WHEN
HE CAN BLAME IT ON FERELL.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.781
THEY CAUGHT HIM RED-HANDED
WITH ONE OF THE VICTIMS.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.151
ALL THAT PROVES
IS THAT MY CLIENT

11:36.190 --> 11:38.021
WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF THE REAL KILLER.

11:38.060 --> 11:40.449
HE WAS CLEARLY SUFFERING
FROM MENTAL ILLNESS
AT THE TIME.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.718
ROSSI: I'LL SAY.
HE HAD HUMAN RECIPES,

11:42.770 --> 11:46.319
SAID HE ATE THE VICTIMS
AND HAD A SATANIC SHRINE.

11:46.370 --> 11:49.237
HE WAS MANIPULATED
BY THE REAL KILLER
TO SAY THOSE THINGS.

11:49.270 --> 11:50.464
THERE WAS NEVER
ANY ACTUAL EVIDENCE

11:50.510 --> 11:51.431
TYING HIM
TO THESE MURDERS.

11:51.470 --> 11:52.903
OK, WELL, WE'RE CONFIDENT

11:52.940 --> 11:54.202
THAT THE FACTS
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.935
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.470
PRENTISS:
WELL, WE'VE GOT OUR WORK
CUT OUT FOR US NOW.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.046
WE NEED TO ATTACK THIS
ON TWO FRONTS.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.968
ONE, FIND OUT IF
FERELL IS KILLING,

12:01.020 --> 12:03.818
TWO, LOOK INTO
HIS LAWYER'S
"HE WAS SET UP" THEORY.

12:03.850 --> 12:05.738
ARE WE REALLY BUYING
THAT FERELL HAD AN ACCOMPLICE

12:05.790 --> 12:06.859
AND THE TEAM MISSED IT BEFORE?

12:06.890 --> 12:09.017
ROSSI: NO MATTER HOW CONFIDENT
WE ARE IN OUR PAST WORK,

12:09.060 --> 12:10.925
WE NEED TO LOOK
AT ALL POSSIBILITIES.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.154
LET THE PROFILE DECIDE.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.521

AND LET'S FIND OUT

12:23.410 --> 12:25.970
I'M SORRY,
BUT I GOTTA ASK,

12:26.010 --> 12:27.830
DID YOU GUYS EAT
THE TAINTED CHILI?

12:27.880 --> 12:29.905
I HAVE ISSUES
WITH GROUP FOOD.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.477
THAT MUST BE LORI,
FERELL'S SISTER.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.819
APPARENTLY HE'S HAD
A LOT OF HOME VISITS
IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS,

12:36.850 --> 12:38.841
SO IT'S UNLIKELY
SHE'S IN ANY DANGER.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.289
SHE HAS A 9-YEAR-OLD SON,
THOUGH.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.959
IT'S A RISK HAVING FERELL
AROUND SOMEONE SO VULNERABLE.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.288
WE GOT FERELL
IN THE WINDOW NOW.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.059
SO HE HASN'T SLIPPED OUT.

LUCKY, BUT HE'S NO MAGICIAN.

12:48.960 --> 12:53.829

PUTS HIM WITHIN 30 FEET
OF THE BASE STATION.

12:56.470 --> 12:59.837
THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.007
I'M SORRY.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.009

WHY THEY'RE HERE.

FOR SOMETHING TO PLAY WITH.

OUR BASEBALL MITTS IN HERE.

TO TELL HIM?

FLAWED SYSTEM.

ALL ALONG TO GET OUT

31:47.500 --> 31:49.468
BUT HE WOULD NEVER
HURT EVONNE.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.139
WHAT KIND OF ISSUES?

31:52.170 --> 31:54.638
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
JUST...

31:54.680 --> 31:56.204
HE WAS DIFFERENT.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.344
IN WHAT WAY?

31:58.380 --> 32:01.474
JUST...

32:01.520 --> 32:03.112
HE'S A LONER.

32:03.150 --> 32:04.481
YOU SAID HE CLEANED UP.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.080
WHAT? AA? THERAPY?

32:07.120 --> 32:08.712
YEAH, HE GOES
TO CHURCH EVERY WEEK

32:08.760 --> 32:11.081
IT REALLY GROUNDS HIM.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.621
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT?

32:21.700 --> 32:23.634
SHE'S PROTECTING HIM.

32:23.670 --> 32:27.060
WHAT IF HER BROTHER
MET FERELL AT THE CHURCH?

32:27.110 --> 32:29.533
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.645
OH. YES.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.977
COME HERE.

32:37.020 --> 32:38.339
YOU MAGICAL
BRILLIANT UNICORN.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.688
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
HOW DID YOU KNOW

32:40.720 --> 32:43.359
THAT THE MORGAN-GARCIA
COCKTAIL IS EXACTLY

32:43.390 --> 32:44.687
WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED?

32:44.730 --> 32:46.152
WELL, I COULDN'T STAND
TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS,

32:46.190 --> 32:48.397
AND I KNEW THAT ONLY
ONE PERSON

32:48.430 --> 32:51.399
COULD PUT THAT SMILE
BACK ON YOUR BABY GIRL FACE.

32:51.430 --> 32:52.397
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

32:52.430 --> 32:55.035
OH! PHONE. LET'S GET IT.

32:55.070 --> 32:56.094
AH!

32:56.140 --> 32:57.289
[BEEP]

32:57.340 --> 32:58.500
WOMAN OF WONDER.
HOW MAY I ASSIST THEE?

32:58.540 --> 33:00.667
I JUST SENT YOU A NAME--
MARCUS MANNING.

33:00.710 --> 33:01.699
I NEED EVERYTHING.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.230
HOT ON HIS TRAIL.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.645
OK, LET'S SEE. MARCUS.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.102
HE'S IN HIS 30$.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.299
HE IS A LIFELONG
AREA RESIDENT.

33:07.350 --> 33:10.376
HE'S HAD A LONG HISTORY
OF THERAPY.

33:10.420 --> 33:12.684
YIKES! HE SCORES VERY HIGH
ON THE NEO SUGGESTIBILITY SCALE.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.278
THAT WOULD MAKE HIM
EASY TO MANIPULATE.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.413
LOOKS LIKE HE WAS BULLIED
A LOT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.757
HE'S GOT A SEALED
JUVIE RECORD.

33:17.790 --> 33:18.654
THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.

33:18.690 --> 33:20.624
PRENTISS:
WE NEED ADDRESSES,
HOME, WORK.

33:20.660 --> 33:22.093
JJ: THE ONLY ADDRESS
THAT COMES UP

33:22.130 --> 33:23.688
IS A TEMPORARY ONE
AT AN SRO.

33:23.730 --> 33:25.322
HE WOULDN'T BE KEEPING
THEM IN THERE.

33:25.370 --> 33:28.168
NEVERTHELESS, I'M SENDING YOU
HIS DL AND ADDRESS.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.395
OK, THAN KS, GARCIA.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.559
WAIT A SECOND.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.579
YEAH, I'VE SEEN
THIS GUY BEFORE.

33:35.610 --> 33:37.373
HE WAS AT FERELL'S
BIBLE STUDY.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.573
YOU'RE THE DEVIL!
YOU HAVE NO PLACE
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD!

33:41.620 --> 33:44.646
GET OUT! YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!

33:44.690 --> 33:48.581
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID?
HE KILLED MY DAUGHTER
10 YEARS AGO!

33:48.620 --> 33:51.726
HE SEEMED INCENSED
WHEN LEE-ANN
TRIED ATTACKING FERELL,

33:51.760 --> 33:53.057
BUT HE DIDN'T INTERCEDE.

33:53.090 --> 33:55.297
NO. IF HE'S THE KILLER,
HE WOULD WAIT

33:55.330 --> 33:56.820
FOR HIS BEST OPPORTUNITY
TO STRIKE.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.589
REID:
HE MAY HAVE TRANSFERRED
HIS RAGE ONTO LEE-ANN.

33:58.630 --> 34:00.188
I'M GONNA CHECK IN
ON HER.

34:00.230 --> 34:01.333
SIMMONS:
NOW THAT I'M THINKING BACK,

34:01.370 --> 34:02.792
MARCUS HAD A BROWN
PAPER LUNCH BAG

34:02.840 --> 34:04.535
ON THE FLOOR BETWEEN
HIM AND FERELL.

34:04.570 --> 34:06.606
AMONGST ALL THE COMMOTION,
I LOST THE BAG,

34:06.640 --> 34:09.609
BUT I WAS WITH FERELL
THE ENTIRE TIME AT THE CHURCH,

34:09.640 --> 34:11.278
EXCEPT FOR...

34:11.310 --> 34:13.244
WHEN HE WAS IN
THE MEN'S ROOM.

34:14.650 --> 34:17.778
I DON'T THINK THAT BAG
WAS THERE WHEN HE LEI-T.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.708
REBECCA'S FINGERS
COULD HAVE BEEN INSIDE.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.217
REID:
LEE-ANN'S NOT ANSWERING
HER CELL PHONE.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.613
EVIDENTLY HER HUSBAND
GOT DRUNK,

34:22.660 --> 34:23.752
FELL ASLEEP ON THE COUCH,

34:23.790 --> 34:25.189
WOKE UP AS SOON
AS SHE WENT TO WORK,

34:25.230 --> 34:26.254
BUT SHE NEVER WENT IN.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.053
MARCUS MUST HAVE
TAKEN HER.

34:30.130 --> 34:34.237
YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE
DISRESPECT ED FLOYD.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.205
MARCUS MANNING'S
JUVENILE RECORD INCLUDES

34:39.240 --> 34:41.231
HIM PULLING A MIKE TYSON
IN THIRD GRADE,

34:41.280 --> 34:42.406
GOT IN A FIGHT
WITH A CLASSMATE

34:42.440 --> 34:43.873
AND BIT A CHUNK
OUT OF HIS EAR.

34:43.910 --> 34:45.673
THANKS, PENELOPE.

34:45.710 --> 34:46.802
HE'S DEFINITELY OUR GUY.

34:46.850 --> 34:47.942
REID: HE MUST HAVE BECOME
OBSESSED AND SOUGHT OUT FERELL

34:47.980 --> 34:50.244
AI-TER REALIZING HE HAD THE SAME
CANNIBALISTIC FANTASIES.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.646
EMULATING HIS CRIMES
MAKES MARCUS FEEL POWERFUL.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.453
HE'D BE UNDER A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF STRESS

34:54.490 --> 34:56.117
SINCE WE COMPROMISED
THE WAREHOUSE.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.388
AND HE KNOWS
FERELL'S AT RISK

34:57.420 --> 34:59.251
BECAUSE HE SAW US
TALKING TO HIM
AT THE CHURCH.

34:59.290 --> 35:01.190
SO HE WOULD REVERT BACK
TO WHAT HE KNOWS.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.198
SINCE HE'S A DEVOTEE,

35:03.230 --> 35:05.494
HE MIGHT GO TO FERELL'S
OLD HOUSE

35:05.530 --> 35:06.792
TO DO HIS DIRTY WORK.

35:06.830 --> 35:09.367
DAVE AND LUKE ARE NEARBY.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.772
I CAN'T WAIT
TO TASTE THIS.

35:30.620 --> 35:33.350
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
GET AWAY FROM ME!

35:33.390 --> 35:34.618
FBI!
DROP YOUR WEAPON!

35:34.660 --> 35:35.888
I'LL KILL HER.

35:35.930 --> 35:36.692
ROSSI: YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT, MARCUS.

35:36.730 --> 35:38.493
WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN
MANIPULATED

35:38.530 --> 35:40.760
INTO DOING ALL OF THIS
BY FLOYD FERELL.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.791
NO.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.831
NO.

35:44.870 --> 35:46.360
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.469
YOU LOOK UP TO HIM, MARCUS,
BUT HE'S USING YOU.

35:48.510 --> 35:51.809
HE WANTED YOU
TO GET CAUGHT.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.545
I DID IT.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.212
I KILLED ALL
THOSE WOMEN IN 2007.

35:57.250 --> 35:58.649
WHAT?

35:58.690 --> 36:01.750
I TRIED TO BE GOOD,
BUT THESE LAST FEW WEEKS,

36:01.790 --> 36:03.587
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.421
I HAD TO KILL AGAIN.

36:06.460 --> 36:07.484
NO!

36:07.530 --> 36:09.828
[LEE-ANN SCREAMS]

36:16.440 --> 36:18.305
HE'S GONE.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.274
IT'S OK.

36:23.310 --> 36:26.438
THAT CONFESSION
IS ALL THAT FERELL NEEDS

36:26.480 --> 36:28.448
TO GET OFF SCOT-FREE.

36:32.850 --> 36:34.454
I GOT YOU.

36:47.900 --> 36:51.336
WE KNOW, BEHAVIORALLY,
THAT MARCUS WAS LYING.

36:51.370 --> 36:53.861
REGARDLESS, WE HAVE TO
TURN OVER HIS DYING DECLARATION

36:53.910 --> 36:55.468
TO FERELL'S DEFENSE COUNSEL.

36:55.510 --> 36:56.807
SHE'LL USE IT
TO GET HIM OUT.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.740
THAT'S WHAT FERELL
WANTED ALL ALONG.

36:58.780 --> 36:59.872
REID: MANIPULATED
THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

36:59.910 --> 37:01.673
TO GET OUT AGAIN
BY COERCING MARCUS

37:01.720 --> 37:03.517
INTO TAKING CREDIT
FOR HIS CRIMES.

WITH A CANNIBAL
ABOUT TO BE RELEASED

37:05.390 --> 37:06.584
BACK INTO MY COMMUNITY.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.917
HOW DO I
PROTECT THEM?

37:07.950 --> 37:10.714
PRENTISS: NONE OF US WANTS
TO RISK WAITING FOR FERELL
TO KILL AGAIN,

37:10.760 --> 37:12.682
AND WE ALL BELIEVE HE WILL,

37:12.730 --> 37:15.290
BUT THERE'S SIMPLY NOTHING
WE CAN DO LEGALLY
AT THIS TIME.

37:15.330 --> 37:16.752
WELL, I CAN'T LEAVE HERE
DOING NOTHING.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.461
I'LL TRY TO GET
THE HOSPITAL BOARD

37:18.500 --> 37:20.388
TO UNDERSTAND FERELL'S
HAND IN ALL THIS.

THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
IN ALL OF THESE FILES

COMMITTED THOSE MURDERS.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.825
IF HE DID DO IT,
HE HID IT SO WELL.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.054
YEAH, HE DID.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.524
TURNS OUT HE WAS
A HELL OF A LOT SMARTER

37:49.560 --> 37:50.959
THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT,
AND THERE'S NO WAY

37:51.000 --> 37:52.820
THAT THIS WAS JUST
ALL DUMB LUCK.

37:52.870 --> 37:53.928
WAIT A MINUTE.

BOARD RIGHT NOW.

QUESTIONS, AGENT ROSSI.

38:13.890 --> 38:15.414
YOU MAY BE EXCUSED.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.382
I WOULD LIKE
TO BE HEARD.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.479
WE BELIEVE THAT MANNING'S
DYING DECLARATION

38:19.530 --> 38:20.849
WAS A FALSE CONFESSION.

38:20.890 --> 38:23.450
AGENT ROSSI, THIS IS
AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING,

38:23.500 --> 38:26.594
NOT A CRIMINAL TRIAL.
YOU'VE ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS,

38:26.630 --> 38:28.530
NOW YOU ARE EXCUSED.

AND EXEMPLARY PARTICIPATION

38:47.890 --> 38:49.482
IN THE THERAPEUTIC PROCESS

38:49.520 --> 38:53.126
DEMONSTRATES EXCELLENT CONTROL
OF PAST DEVIANT FANTASIES.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.354
YES, MA'AM.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.628
WE FURTHER FIND
YOUR ADHERENCE

38:55.660 --> 38:58.049

AND SAFETY PLAN

38:58.100 --> 39:00.091
INDICATE YOU ARE
NO LONGER A RISK

39:00.130 --> 39:01.688
TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS.

39:01.740 --> 39:02.832
FERELL: NO, MA'AM, I'M NOT.

39:02.870 --> 39:04.963
WE CAN'T GIVE YOU BACK
THE LAST DECADE,

39:05.010 --> 39:07.934
HOWEVER, WE OFFER
OUR OFFICIAL APOLOGY

39:07.970 --> 39:10.029

DETAINING YOU HERE.

THAT, MA'AM.

YOU'RE FREE TO GO,
MR. FERELL.

39:14.550 --> 39:18.042
MS. CHAIRWOMAN,
I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE INTERRUPTION,

39:18.080 --> 39:20.981
BUT I HAVE AN ISSUE
THAT I NEED TO DISCUSS

39:21.020 --> 39:23.716
WITH THE BOARD.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.819
IF IT IS ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY.

39:25.860 --> 39:28.749
WELL, MY COLLEAGUE
HAS JUST HANDED ME

39:28.800 --> 39:32.099
MARCUS MANNING'S
AUTOPSY REPORT.

39:32.130 --> 39:36.430
THE M.E. DISCOVERED 5
OF THE LAST VICTIM'S FINGERS

39:36.470 --> 39:37.562
IN HIS STOMACH.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.136
WHAT RELEVANCE
DOES THAT HAVE

39:39.170 --> 39:40.603
TO THE MATTER
BEFORE THIS BOARD?

39:40.640 --> 39:41.834
WELL, THE REMAINING FINGERS

39:43.810 --> 39:46.973
AND SO I HAVE HERE
A SEARCH WARRANT

39:47.010 --> 39:50.446
TO SERVE MR. FERELL.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.619
I OBJECT TO THIS
OBVIOUS ATTEMPT

39:52.650 --> 39:53.878
TO PUNISH MY CLIENT.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.912
YOU CAN SEARCH MY ROOM,
MY SISTER'S HOUSE,

39:56.960 --> 39:58.621
EVEN MY OLD PLACE.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.821
YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING.

40:00.860 --> 40:02.157
OH, DID I NEGLECT TO SAY

40:02.200 --> 40:04.691
THE WARRANT ISN'T
TO SEARCH A LOCATION.

40:04.730 --> 40:06.618
IT'S FOR AN X-RAY

40:06.670 --> 40:10.162
OF FLOYD FEYLINN FERELL'S
DIGESTIVE TRACT.

40:10.200 --> 40:14.136

REBECCA'S OTHER 5 FINGERS

FLOYD.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.579
NO!

I'LL KILL YOU!

40:22.020 --> 40:23.510
NO! NO!

40:23.550 --> 40:25.848
AND SINCE THIS BOARD
HAS JUST GIVEN YOU

40:25.890 --> 40:27.915

40:35.060 --> 40:36.220
ALL THE MURDERS
YOU COMMITTED 10 YEARS AGO.

40:36.260 --> 40:37.750
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

THE REAL CONFLICT IS
BETWEEN TRUTH AND LIES."

I AM SO...

41:05.730 --> 41:07.550
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.228
