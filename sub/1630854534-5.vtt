WEBVTT

00:25.520 --> 00:26.880
Oops.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.440
Oopsie.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.920
Well it was always gonna happen,
wasn't it?

00:39.960 --> 00:41.680
Yeah, it was.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.160
With a big lasagne face like yours

00:48.880 --> 00:50.840
how could I say no?

00:50.880 --> 00:52.040
Yeah.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.320
I need your bed.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.960
I need yours.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I need your bed.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.040
I need your bed.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.200
Yes. What?

01:04.239 --> 01:06.880
I need your bed.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.400
Oh my god yeah.
Your bed.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.240
It's your bed.
I need your bed.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.040
Yeah, baby. Fucken, yeah.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.360
Please, I need your bed.
We need it back now.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.000
Who are you? What's happening?

01:18.040 --> 01:19.760
Please, if you could get up.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
Oh, yep, sorry.
Now.

01:20.840 --> 01:21.880
Yep.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.120
And the dog as well.
Yeah, he's going. Fuck.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.520
(DOG MOANS QUIETLY)
I've gotta get his wheels.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.800
Just wait.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.400
VW Golf. We're talking 2012.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.240
Fuck, I thought you were doing an
overnight.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.280
Did they wake you?

01:57.320 --> 01:59.960
Yeah, no, 'cause I swapped shifts so
I could do my assignment.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.240
They're taking my bed.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.320
Dad just told me. I'm so sorry.

02:03.360 --> 02:06.240
They need it back. It's expensive.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.720
Where am I gonna sleep?
I love that bed.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.400
We'll get you a blow-up mattress
or something.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.160
Don't worry, you can stay.
OK.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.600
Just one second, will you?
Thanks.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.960
Morning, Ashley, sorry about the
rude interruption.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.840
That's alright.
Sweetheart, these are my sisters.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.280
Blythe, Beth, Babs and Louise.
Hi.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.040
Oh, didn't get a B-name,
did you Lou?

02:25.080 --> 02:27.200
No.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.400
So with that bed,
is there another one coming in,

02:30.440 --> 02:33.080
or the old one maybe coming back?
Is that downstairs?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.320
We need you out, darl.
Hmm?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.880
My boy, Nathan's, flying in from
Barcelona in a few days

02:36.920 --> 02:38.000
and he'll be needing Mum's room.
What?

02:38.040 --> 02:40.680
How long's he staying for?
As long as he likes.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.840
Oh, that's not fair. Dad!

02:42.880 --> 02:45.480
Mum paid for your piano lessons,
Megan love.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.360
No more favourites.
I was gonna say that!

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
Favourites. Exactly.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.840
Who's got their eye on the
sideboard?

02:49.880 --> 02:50.920
Ooh, me!
No, that's mine.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.280
Sorry, I know the sideboard's pretty
fucking pressing,

02:53.320 --> 02:55.320
but where were you
all when Nan was dying?

02:55.360 --> 02:56.440
Excuse me?

02:56.480 --> 02:57.680
Because Ash and I were here.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.520
We are the daughters, darling.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.000
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, the daughters.
But I was here.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.960
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, the daughters.
But I was here.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.520
I cared for her.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.680
Yeah, stealing mum's morphine.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.280
You're a fucking pig, Blythe.
OK, easy on.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.280
Oh sorry,
am I not entitled to a say here?

03:11.320 --> 03:12.840
Is it, is it 'cause I'm adopted?

03:12.880 --> 03:15.080
Told you she'd pull the A-card.
Bingo.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.320
Excuse me!

03:16.360 --> 03:17.680
If you can just hang on one
more time.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.280
Blythe, please, don't start.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.440
Oh, I'll start.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.000
Sorry. Hey, what about the couch?
Ooh!

03:22.040 --> 03:23.840
I'm talking the couch.
Ooh, no, I am!

03:23.880 --> 03:25.800
I just meant to stay on.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.520
OK, Ash, sorry sweetheart,
you're out.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.840
Don't talk shit about my daughter,
alright?

03:30.880 --> 03:32.800
Anyway, your Nathan's a pervert.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.760
How fucking dare you!
Oh, how fucking...

03:34.800 --> 03:36.120
What do you mean by a pervert?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.320
Oh, is this surprise?
Is this surprise?

03:38.360 --> 03:40.080
Megan, you know what happened...
This is disgusting!

03:40.120 --> 03:41.720
Beth! Babs!
You're making things up!

03:41.760 --> 03:43.800
No! She was in the toilet!

03:43.840 --> 03:46.960
She was in the toilet,
and he came in and he...

03:47.920 --> 03:49.360
(EXHALES)

03:55.800 --> 03:59.320
Ah, just a sec. Hi.
Hey.
You on the phone?

03:59.360 --> 04:00.000
Yeah. Huh? Yes, I'm just on hold.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.440
Yeah. Huh? Yes, I'm just on hold.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.200
Yeah, cool. Um, here he is.
Here he is.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.160
Yes, thanks for...you got my text I
was coming over?

04:07.200 --> 04:08.960
Mmm, mmm, yep.
Yeah?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.800
Hey boy. Hey.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.520
Ah, how are you?

04:12.560 --> 04:15.120
Yeah, all good.
Just um...well I'm not.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.399
I've got this huge assignment due,

04:16.440 --> 04:18.760
and like Peggy's daughters are in
town stealing all her shit.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.040
It is so gross.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.280
Yeah, far out.

04:21.320 --> 04:26.000
Just wondering, I know this is
difficult, but your room.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.360
Could I...
Where are you?

04:29.840 --> 04:33.760
Oh!
Hi.
You guys remember...?

04:33.800 --> 04:36.360
Ashley.
Yvette.
Hey.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.160
I was just dropping off
the dog, so...

04:38.200 --> 04:40.120
Cool.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.320
OK!
OK. OK.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.640
Alright, um, I'll leave you to it.
Mm-hm.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.120
OK. Um, I might see you at
Trivia later.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.040
Yeah, I mean, I'll be working so...
Oh, that's OK. I don't mind.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.080
OK.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.840
Alright. I'll text you, though.
OK, great.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.720
But we'll see.
OK.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.000
Um, I've left some clothes
upstairs...

05:00.000 --> 05:00.160
Um, I've left some clothes
upstairs...

05:00.200 --> 05:01.600
Oh.
..but I'll just get them next time.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.400
OK.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.600
Really.

05:09.640 --> 05:14.880
That was quick.
I mean, I left five days ago.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.680
It was six, actually.
Oh.

05:16.720 --> 05:21.320
And um, she and I were seeing each
other a couple of months ago.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.800
But it was over, right?

05:22.840 --> 05:25.360
I didn't think you wanted to hang
out anymore, Ash.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.960
I tried to call you again and again.
You never got back in touch.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.960
Yeah, 'cause I was working,
and studying, Gordon.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.800
If I had thought for just a second

05:32.840 --> 05:34.480
that you were the tiniest bit
interested...

05:34.520 --> 05:36.640
You can't be alone for five minutes?
Ash, you moved out!

05:36.680 --> 05:38.160
Yeah, that was appropriate,

05:38.200 --> 05:41.320
because we were strangers and then
we were living together.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.800
Yeah, you're right. You are right.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.040
Is that...
is she the reason everything

05:50.080 --> 05:52.160
went weird the other night? Like...
No. No.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.320
No?
No.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.400
'Cause it's obviously working just
fine with her.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.480
No, it's...it's...
Was it something I did?

05:57.520 --> 06:00.000
No. God, Ash, no! You're...Dave!
Sorry?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.200
No. God, Ash, no! You're...Dave!
Sorry?

06:01.240 --> 06:02.880
Just a second, mate.
I'll just be a second.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.480
Sorry, just a sec.
I've really gotta take this call.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.840
I'm really sorry.
Do you want to come inside?

06:06.880 --> 06:08.360
No, absolutely not.
Have a coffee?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.080
I can make you a coffee...
No, I've gotta go anyway.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.400
Come here, boy. Oh, good boy.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.560
Dave, hello mate.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.280
Yes mate, I'm just following up on
that invoice that we sent through.

06:26.320 --> 06:30.040
Exactly, mate, and I'm so sorry.
No, no, totally, totally.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.440
It's my...yeah.

06:31.480 --> 06:35.880
We just sort of need it paid
ASA...oh mate, mate, mate, totally.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.040
Money's tight all over.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.640
You don't have to tell me,
it's fine.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.560
Oh no, there's no need to do that,

06:41.600 --> 06:43.560
'cause we are thrilled to be on the
taps there, mate.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.120
Honestly, we're just...yeah.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.200
Yes, that's right mate.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.200
But if you could,
I'd really...

06:49.240 --> 06:50.560
you've gotta go.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.080
But...but...but...yep.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.960
Fuck.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.720
Coward.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
Ash!

07:17.400 --> 07:18.800
Oh my god, don't do that.

07:18.840 --> 07:19.960
Sorry.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.840
Almost got my rape alarm out.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.000
Do you have a rape alarm?

07:23.040 --> 07:25.280
You've met my mother.
I have several.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.240
OK, fair enough. Listen, I just...

07:28.280 --> 07:30.920
I'm genuinely mortified about
that whole thing.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
Are you OK?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.840
I mean, it wasn't great and um,

07:33.880 --> 07:36.400
I've got a lot of work to do,
and nowhere to live right now.

07:36.440 --> 07:40.440
And Yvette is just so much hotter
than I remembered.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.920
Well she was then, but I think she
got into my make-up bag.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.640
(PHONE VIBRATES)
Oh fuck!

07:45.680 --> 07:46.880
What?

07:46.920 --> 07:48.920
My ride just cancelled. I just...

07:50.840 --> 07:52.160
Argh!

07:57.240 --> 07:59.480
Do you wanna come to my bar and
work from there?

07:59.520 --> 08:00.000
People do it all the time.
Mm.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.440
People do it all the time.
Mm.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.480
We got free wi-fi.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.520
Tell you what, I'll do you a lovely
flight of chips.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.800
How's that sound?

08:08.840 --> 08:11.400
Is everything in a brewery
called a flight?

08:11.440 --> 08:14.040
Yes. We can charge more for it.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.720
What do you reckon?

08:18.760 --> 08:21.440
I'll go get Col. You stay here.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.720
Just blink once if you're
gonna come with me.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.280
There we go.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.480
# #

08:33.680 --> 08:35.960
Here we go.
Hey.
Crappster.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.680
Hey, we've got about six
weeks of unpaid invoices here.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.320
Don't start, mate.
Do you need me to chase them?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.080
Is that what you need?
I don't need to chase them up,

08:43.120 --> 08:44.920
and I was just on the phone to Dave
from the Glenmore,

08:44.960 --> 08:46.040
and I tore him a new arsehole,

08:46.080 --> 08:48.320
so it's in hand, don't worry,
and hello.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.920
Oh good, you brought the dog.
Yeah.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.360
I have a name.
Oh!

08:51.400 --> 08:52.600
Oh.
Sorry. Kidding.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.600
I'm Ashley. Are you Chiara?
You're Ashley?

08:55.640 --> 08:57.400
Yeah.
You OK, Chi?

08:57.440 --> 09:00.000
Yeah. You're just very nice looking
and so...just normal.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.200
Yeah. You're just very nice looking
and so...just normal.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.520
You seem very normal.
No, no, no, no.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.800
No, no, you listen to me.
She is.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.880
Yeah, of course.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.960
Well, I need that equipment
yesterday, OK?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.680
So don't make me come round
there. Yeah?

09:11.720 --> 09:13.360
Cool. Love you too.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.400
OK, bye. Bye, bye, bye.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.680
Hey, whose idea was it to do trivia
night, anyways?

09:17.720 --> 09:18.720
It was yours.
Yours, mate.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.800
Oh yeah. Hey!
Sorry.
Bretty, this is Ashley.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.000
Flashley?
No, just Ashley.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.120
Right, they both know.
Yeah.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.640
You should come to the trivia
night tonight.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.680
Leave her alone, mate.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.160
She's just here for the wi-fi.
I am.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.200
You can set up anywhere.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.440
But you know, if you've got any
questions about the cerebral cortex,

09:35.480 --> 09:36.520
I'm your girl.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.440
How big is it?
What's that?

09:38.480 --> 09:40.960
The cerebral cortex.
Maybe I could add in a question.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.040
Oh, well it's all folded up,

09:43.080 --> 09:44.360
to maximise surface area,

09:44.400 --> 09:48.200
but if you did unfold it,
it's like a 20-inch pizza.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.200
Shit! So, a large?

09:50.240 --> 09:51.400
No, it's like an extra-large.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.040
I think Pizza Hut only goes to
like 14-inches.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.880
I think you should marry her.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.000
Oh, she probably wouldn't say
yes, mate.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.480
Righto, mate!
No, I'm kidding.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.520
Sort of.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.480
But she is out of your league.
Yeah, mate, I'm not marrying her.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.920
Yeah, because she would never
say yes...

10:05.960 --> 10:06.960
Will you stop it?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.320
I have a bit of a fucking
dilemma, actually.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.960
Oh, OK. Sorry. Go on, then...
OK, don't touch me.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.480
So she wasn't interested.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.560
She moved out.
Obviously.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.200
Stop!
Sorry.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.360
Now I think she might be interested,
but I'm not sure.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
And I mean, I don't know. She's 29.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.000
I mean, is that appropriate?
It's not appropriate, right?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.120
That's ridiculous, isn't it?
I agree.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.160
It does seem ridiculous.
No, it's fine.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.680
I'm 30, and we're soulmates.
You and me?

10:29.720 --> 10:31.600
Yeah.
I wouldn't have thought so.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.680
But you remember Yvette? The vet?
Yeah.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.120
Right. She's 40, and she's nice.
Oh...

10:37.160 --> 10:39.160
But you...that's...is that...
that's better isn't it?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.360
You told me that was better.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.320
OK, to date, that is the best one
you've ever brought us.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.760
She's funny. She's got big brains.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.880
Why did we only ever talk
about her tit?

10:48.920 --> 10:51.880
Oh, you guys are fucked. Honestly.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.560
(WHISTLES)

11:18.840 --> 11:20.400
# #

11:20.440 --> 11:22.320
OK kids, we're open for biz.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.680
Let's have a yabba-dabba day.

11:23.720 --> 11:24.720
(CLUNK)

11:24.760 --> 11:26.080
(BEEPING)

11:26.120 --> 11:27.520
(MUSIC STOPS)

11:27.560 --> 11:28.920
What the fuck?

11:28.960 --> 11:31.760
Gordo, the fridge just went off.
Everything just went off.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.200
Did you pay the power bill?
Yeah, yes, yes I think.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.160
Well did you or didn't you?
Fuck!

11:38.200 --> 11:40.200
Oh, what?
Where's the power?

11:40.240 --> 11:41.560
I've got a full AV presentation.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.040
Brett, could you check the
fermenters, please?

11:43.080 --> 11:44.400
What happened to the lights?

11:44.440 --> 11:46.400
'Cause the wi-fi's off, too.
Alrighty!

11:46.440 --> 11:49.120
Alright, I'll hotspot.
Youse open?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.640
Oh yeah! Yep. Yep.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.880
Yes.
Yep, we are.

11:51.920 --> 11:52.960
Welcome, ladies.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.040
Come, come, come on in.
Here we go!

11:55.080 --> 11:56.120
Not much vibe.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.080
No tunes. This place is dead.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.360
Yeah, because...
There's a reason for that.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.000
..we're conserving today.
Today, all day...

12:00.000 --> 12:02.160
..we're conserving today.
Today, all day...

12:02.200 --> 12:03.760
For the...for the environment.
The environment.

12:03.800 --> 12:04.800
We're conserving.
Yep.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.000
Nothing's gonna be on at all.
What, like an Earth Day thing?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.360
Yes!
Yes, exactly.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.480
Happy Earth Day.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.120
Isn't, ah, isn't Earth Day in April?
Sorry. Yes, not Earth Day.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.960
Today we are observing its twin,
which is...

12:17.000 --> 12:18.120
Climate...

12:18.160 --> 12:19.760
..crisis...
In Crisis Day.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.800
CCD.

12:20.840 --> 12:21.840
Yeah.
For us.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.240
Like a sister day to Earth Day.
Twin sisters.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.280
Yep.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.160
So every beer you buy today,
we donate...

12:27.200 --> 12:28.760
Donate a dollar.

12:28.800 --> 12:33.240
..a dollar to the Earth. Foundation.
Of the Amazon.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.240
The Earth Foundation.
The A...the EFA...

12:35.280 --> 12:36.520
You don't have to worry about that.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
Anyway.
Yeah.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.400
So there's very hungry kids in the
Amazon

12:39.440 --> 12:40.640
and we'd like to just
do our bit.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.520
Yeah, is it gonna get busy, or...
Oh god, you know what?

12:43.560 --> 12:45.840
CCD Day is actually the...

12:45.880 --> 12:48.480
CCD is the um...
CCA...CCD is...

12:48.520 --> 12:50.000
It's one of the biggest days
of the year.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.360
The Foundation which runs this
Earth Day, which is CEA.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.440
And it gets massive.
Yep, yep.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.600
So if you guys wanna get
the big...big...

12:56.640 --> 12:58.120
It's all yours.
Yeah, cool!

12:58.160 --> 13:00.000
OK, well then Dudders here is
getting married.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.800
OK, well then Dudders here is
getting married.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.840
Whoa!
(CHEERS AND LAUGHTER)

13:02.880 --> 13:03.960
I hope she's a blonde.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
(CRICKETS)

13:05.040 --> 13:06.280
No.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.960
Nup. Doesn't matter.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.720
We'll take two of everything.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.760
Yes, OK.
Fuck yeah.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.120
But the computers aren't working,
obviously,

13:12.160 --> 13:13.240
so you just need
cash for that.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.120
Fuck that.
Ah, we...

13:15.160 --> 13:16.160
Don't fuck that... Yeah.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.280
..because I haven't yet said...
The other bit.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.240
It's all half price.
Half price.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.440
Because we have half the
environment left.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.480
(CHEERING)

13:29.680 --> 13:32.040
Hey, how are you two going?
Hey, yeah, we're good.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.080
Good.
What happened?

13:34.120 --> 13:37.720
Oh, it's a 100% my fault.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.720
I forgot to pay the power bill for
the second time.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.800
Oh, that's bad.
It's really not good.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.000
And all of our clients are terrible
at paying our invoices on time.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.560
Don't you have like a money person?
No, it's just us.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.600
Oh.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.440
And like Chi could do it,
but she's kinda bad cop.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.520
I'm good cop, so I try and foster
relationships.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.560
Uh-huh.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.120
Which I can do, but I suck at
asking for money.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.000
Like I haven't even hit you up for
the 6K you owe me

13:59.040 --> 14:00.000
for Colin's surgery.
I know.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.400
for Colin's surgery.
I know.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.280
And that was two weeks ago.
I know.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.640
But listen, with that, I know you
don't have the money yet.

14:04.680 --> 14:08.520
It's fine.
Um, but, I mean, it hasn't helped.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.280
I mean, I took it out of the
business account and...

14:10.320 --> 14:13.320
Oh, I feel terrible.
No, don't, don't.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.560
I didn't say that to make you feel
bad, and it's my fault.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.960
I'm the one that hit the dog.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.000
Whoa, wait, did you just say that it
was your fault?

14:24.040 --> 14:25.600
Did I? Did I?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.280
You did.
Yeah, I did.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.600
You just got like 40% hotter.
40%.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.880
'Cause you took responsibility.
It was hot.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.040
OK. Noted.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.800
By the way, you should stay for
trivia night,

14:37.840 --> 14:39.360
because if the power
doesn't come back on,

14:39.400 --> 14:40.840
I think it's going to be pretty
funny.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.480
I thought Yvette was coming to
trivia.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.560
I don't think she's going...

14:46.600 --> 14:47.800
I never asked her to come.

14:47.840 --> 14:51.440
Mm, 'cause it sounded like she was
coming.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.200
I don't think she's going to come.
Right.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.640
I might be seeing someone at
work later.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.880
Oh, OK.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.000
Can you not be alone for
five minutes?

15:00.000 --> 15:00.680
Can you not be alone for
five minutes?

15:00.720 --> 15:02.440
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.600
I'm just trying to keep up
with you, mate.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.440
Totally. Totally.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.320
Hey, are we really donating a dollar
a beer to the Amazon?

15:16.360 --> 15:17.360
Fuck no.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.760
We're not making money with this
half-price shit.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.960
Well, what if someone
Googles Climate Crisis Day?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.560
OK, I saw on Facebook that yesterday
was National Cousins Day.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.520
Who fact checked that? Nobody.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.160
Man, I should have called my
hot cousin.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
No, you shouldn't have.
Don't start that shit again, mate.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.120
You guys are weird about her.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.160
Oh yeah, we're weird,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.840
'cause we're the one that's obsessed
with your hot cousin.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.160
Bretty, could you check the
fermenter for me?

15:37.200 --> 15:39.200
I'm concerned that it's like a yeast
infection back there.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.760
Do you reckon we've lost the
whole batch?

15:40.800 --> 15:41.800
I don't know.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.000
But look, if it's not too far gone,

15:43.040 --> 15:44.480
fuck it, we'll just
call it a sour.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.720
Good idea.
Great.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.000
Can you do that?
Yeah, that's how sours start...

15:48.040 --> 15:49.960
fuckin, what is she doing here?
What are you doing?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.160
Where are her mates?
Who?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.320
Yvette the vet.
Don't look, don't look.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.760
Oh, did she not get the memo?

15:54.800 --> 15:57.000
To be fair, she did spend the
night last night.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.080
Oh, Gordon!

15:58.120 --> 15:59.480
You're such an arsehole.
Do you know that?

15:59.520 --> 16:00.000
I know.
Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.520
I know.
Yeah.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.040
But I thought Ashley was done.
Like we...we...she ghosted me.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.000
Oh, like you're currently doing
to the vet?

16:05.040 --> 16:07.000
I know, I suck.
Yeah, you do.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.920
Why don't you just slither away,
and I will take care of her.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.200
Would you do that for me?
Yes.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.400
Fuck off.
I love you.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.800
OK, well great.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.040
Hi, Yvette! Hi!
Chiara, hi.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.880
How are you?
Yeah, good.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.200
Yeah.
Is Gordon here?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.920
Oh yeah, he's just gone out the
back for a wank.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.920
For a...
A wank?

16:22.960 --> 16:24.440
Yeah, a big old wank.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.040
Yeah, thank you so much for this
extension, Monica.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.000
I mean, my family and I really
appreciate it.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.880
And obviously if Dad could,
you know, talk at the moment,

16:34.920 --> 16:36.760
he would thank you himself,
but yeah, sorry.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.120
I just think about how close we came
to losing him.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.160
Yeah. OK, thank you again, Monica.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.360
Santa Monica. OK, bye.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.760
Brett, sit down and read me that
last invoice.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.560
I have 2% left on my computer,

16:50.600 --> 16:53.080
but I reckon I can fire off one more
email.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.040
Yes, boss.
What do you need me to do?

16:56.080 --> 16:58.560
Um, name and how much.
How much do they owe us?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.000
Dave at the Glenmore.
Dave.

17:00.000 --> 17:00.600
Dave at the Glenmore.
Dave.

17:00.640 --> 17:05.200
$8,548.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.960
8,000 fucken...he's having a laugh.
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.640
What a joker.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.240
Oh.
We have...

17:15.280 --> 17:17.160
Do you think I have a nice
speaking voice?

17:18.280 --> 17:19.880
Yeah, why?

17:19.920 --> 17:23.760
I'm just going over the questions
for tonight, and I'm a bit nervous.

17:23.800 --> 17:27.400
Oh no, you'll be great.
It's gonna be great.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.520
Thanks.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.960
You know you're a top chick,
you know that?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.600
Thank you.

17:32.640 --> 17:36.680
And, ah, Gordo's a bit of a
dickhead, right?

17:36.720 --> 17:37.760
Yeah.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.120
But once he gets out of his own
way, he's um...

17:40.160 --> 17:41.680
..he's worth it.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.760
Sorry, did he tell you to say
this to me?

17:44.800 --> 17:45.880
No way.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.120
And don't tell him I told you
'cause he's a massive dickhead.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.480
Oh, looky here. Chummy.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.720
Hello, Yvette.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.760
I thought you were here to see
Gordon,

17:55.800 --> 17:58.240
but obviously you found someone new,
so that's good.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.000
Oh no, she's my amiga.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.240
Oh no, she's my amiga.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.720
Mm-hm.
Female friend.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.760
Anyway, I have to go.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.880
Are you seeing Gordon?
This afternoon?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.720
I don't think so.
No.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.520
Are you seeing him?

18:15.560 --> 18:17.040
Well that's...
that's between Gordon and I.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.600
No it isn't, because I'm seeing him.
OK.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.120
You look weird together, actually.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.800
Because you're too young for
him, OK?

18:25.840 --> 18:27.800
So, run along home to your parties

18:27.840 --> 18:30.880
and your poppers and your pingers,
OK?

18:30.920 --> 18:33.360
Do you know how hard it is to find a
man in his 40s

18:33.400 --> 18:35.680
that's not a complete
psycho or a fat dad?

18:35.720 --> 18:38.960
So, if you could just let me have
this one, that'd be great.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.360
When you're in your 40s,
you'll understand.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.760
Actually, I'm gonna do what I want.
But thank you.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.800
Thanks for the chat. Bye.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.520
Are you forgetting your dog?

18:52.320 --> 18:53.400
Yes, I am.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.040
But Brett's gonna look
after him, aren't ya?

18:55.080 --> 18:56.680
Anything for you, love.
Thank you.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.000
Hey, did you know that I am over a
fathom tall?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.240
Hey, did you know that I am over a
fathom tall?

19:01.280 --> 19:04.040
Fath...fath...fathom.
I'll get back to you.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.120
Fuck sake.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.840
# #

19:17.240 --> 19:18.640
It's just through here.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.040
I've gotta get back.
15 minutes max.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.480
(KISSING SOUNDS)

19:23.520 --> 19:24.960
What is this?
I've never been in here before.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.480
It's for med students.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.160
You've done this before.
Maybe.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.080
(ALARM)

19:37.120 --> 19:38.200
(THUD)

19:38.240 --> 19:40.520
What the fuck is that?
Ah...

19:41.880 --> 19:43.200
(ALARM STOPS)
Ash?

19:43.240 --> 19:45.360
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

19:45.400 --> 19:48.080
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

19:48.120 --> 19:50.280
I showed you this room.
What was that noise?

19:50.320 --> 19:53.000
It was a rape alarm that my Mum got
me,

19:53.040 --> 19:55.840
so I'll let her know it works.
Thank you.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.240
Do do...do you wanna come out?
Did you hurt your head?

19:59.280 --> 20:00.000
No I didn't.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.280
No I didn't.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.400
Hey, you're pretty.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.400
What's your name?
Tessa.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.280
I'm gonna report you for fucking in
here, Tessa.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.880
We weren't fucking.
You were about to.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.200
She's nice.
She is.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.560
Yes I am coming to work,
thanks James.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.480
I'm sorry. I...
Can you fuck off?

20:22.600 --> 20:25.360
Oh, fuck sake.
Yes, Tess, Tess, wait up.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.680
Whatever!

20:26.720 --> 20:27.960
# #

20:30.640 --> 20:32.560
There you go, champions.
Keep drinking for the earth.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.800
Cheers.
Thank you.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.120
Is she still looking?
Mm-hm. Sure is.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.600
Don't look up.
OK.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.040
Don't look up.
Alright.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.240
Don't look up.
OK.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.360
Oh! I looked up.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.160
She won't stop staring at me.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.280
Mm-hm. You know what?

20:47.320 --> 20:51.000
I do not approve of your behaviour,
but she does seem a little unhinged.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.240
What'd you tell her before?

20:52.280 --> 20:53.360
I said you went for a wank.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.320
What?
A big old wank.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.200
You didn't, did you?
No.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.000
Did you?
No.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.600
Did you?
No.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.640
Fuck you.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.800
Gene...
Can I help you?

21:09.840 --> 21:12.720
Ooh! Sorry, yes, I was just leaving
my assignment here.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.920
Ooh, a hard copy.
Something's finally sinking in.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
Thank you.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.080
Yeah, and I wanted you to see it's
early, and I'm making an effort.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.880
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Off you go.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.840
What is that?

21:24.880 --> 21:26.120
I'm very busy.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.480
Is that Gordon Crapp?

21:29.680 --> 21:32.280
Yes. Do you know him?

21:32.320 --> 21:36.480
Yeah, um, we met recently.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.560
Is he OK?
Yes, he's...

21:40.400 --> 21:41.880
He had cancer?

21:42.960 --> 21:45.600
And you had cancer?
Well deduced.

21:45.640 --> 21:46.720
Hooroo.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.640
I don't know how many times I
have to ask you to leave.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.760
Yes, I'm going.

21:54.760 --> 21:59.000
Could you, ah, say hello
to Flash for me?

22:00.440 --> 22:01.720
Beautiful man. One of the good ones.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.200
# #

22:27.040 --> 22:28.320
Two, one, two, two.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.240
Alright guys, not long now.
Just bear with us, please.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.280
I'm fucked.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.480
Oh, you'll be OK, mate.
Just...just project.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.280
I promised these people
a multimedia extravaganza.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.640
Why?
Oh, I don't know.

22:43.680 --> 22:47.520
Yes! Oh!
Yes!

22:47.560 --> 22:49.360
We're excited. We're all
excited, guys.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.480
Whoo!
Ah...

22:50.520 --> 22:51.920
We have reached our target.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.640
That's why I've turned the power
back on, because we did it.

22:54.680 --> 22:55.800
Well done. That was all you guys.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.960
That wasn't us, that was you guys.
So, big hand.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.360
Round of applause.
Thank you for that.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.000
So mission accomplished.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.080
So mission accomplished.

23:01.120 --> 23:04.960
But let's keep that vibe up,
because very soon

23:05.000 --> 23:06.920
we've got the inaugural trivia night
with the inimitable Bretty,

23:06.960 --> 23:08.040
so stick around for that.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.400
Drinks are still half price
though, yeah?

23:10.440 --> 23:11.440
BOTH: No.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.600
But, ah, we will have Bretty with
the fantastic trivia.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.480
He's got some wonderful questions,
and I think he's ready.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.880
Over to you, Brett!
Whoo!

23:17.920 --> 23:21.480
Alright, alright, alright!
Everyone, it's Saturday night!

23:21.520 --> 23:25.600
Who's ready for some
Cape Trivulation!

23:27.720 --> 23:29.400
Alright guys, get
your team names in.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.480
It's gonna be sick.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.720
Another one?
Do you want...

23:32.760 --> 23:35.480
Nah.
I'll wait for you.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.520
Yeah, cool, cool.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.320
Another one?
No thanks.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.680
No worries.
Saturday night!

23:41.720 --> 23:43.800
Ah, can't watch this.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.160
And that concludes our famous
foreheads.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.920
Famous foreheads,
everyone.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.840
Alright, I'll give you two minutes
to bring in your first round answers.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.280
Two minutes, thank you.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.000
Hey, everything good here?
Didn't take you for a trivia nerd.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.600
Hey, everything good here?
Didn't take you for a trivia nerd.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.320
You don't take me for much, do you?

24:03.920 --> 24:05.680
Joking.
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
Why don't you join Colin and I?

24:06.760 --> 24:09.040
Our team's called
Walk Like A Veterinarian.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.840
I'd love to,
but I've gotta keep working.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.560
Oh, come on, you promised.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.920
Well I didn't really promise,

24:13.960 --> 24:15.880
I said I'd be working tonight.

24:15.920 --> 24:19.160
Boo! I'm looking after your dog.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.720
Yeah, which is great,
but he's fine anywhere, obviously.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.720
I'd better keep moving.
OK, what are we doing here?

24:23.760 --> 24:26.800
Well I'm working.
No, you know what I mean.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.640
(SIGHS)

24:29.680 --> 24:31.840
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is now not a convenient time?

24:31.880 --> 24:34.600
Should I try again later when
you're horny?

24:35.640 --> 24:36.720
Yvette...
Yvette.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.960
Yvette!
That's what you sound like.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.280
That is your voice.
OK.

24:40.320 --> 24:41.800
Can you...hey!
Hey. Hey, hey.

24:41.840 --> 24:42.920
Hey, hey.
Hey, I just...

24:42.960 --> 24:44.200
What are you doing?
I didn't mean...

24:44.240 --> 24:45.960
Just let go. Let go.
Let go, please.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.280
Hey.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.560
Let go. Yvette, let go.
No...

24:48.600 --> 24:49.600
No, no, no, no, no.
I just...

24:49.640 --> 24:51.160
You gotta let go.
Why?

24:51.200 --> 24:53.840
Because I'm working and this was
never gonna be a social thing.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.040
I'm working.
Oh, OK.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.560
Is it Bring Your Niece to Work Day
today, is it?

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
OK.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.000
You look like her creepy uncle!

25:00.000 --> 25:01.120
You look like her creepy uncle!

25:01.160 --> 25:04.800
Big fat, floppy Uncle Dad.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.920
Gross. Ohh!

25:09.800 --> 25:10.880
Floppy.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.160
# #

25:17.600 --> 25:19.560
Here brother, enjoy.
Thank you.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.200
Hey!
Hey, here he is!

25:24.240 --> 25:26.800
Man of the hour.
Hey, where's Ash?

25:26.840 --> 25:28.400
I think she's at work.
True.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.840
Good head for business, that girl.
What do you mean?

25:30.880 --> 25:32.080
Calling AGL and everything.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.000
I thought that was you, Crappster.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.360
Yeah, and then she got us an
extension saying

25:37.400 --> 25:39.520
that her Dad had a stroke or
something.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.600
What?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.640
Yeah, and then she emailed a bunch
of the clients,

25:42.680 --> 25:44.240
pretending to be
our accountant.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.840
She signed them off as Colin.
BOTH: Colin?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.120
Yeah, Colin from Accounts.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.240
Set up an email
and everything.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.440
Yeah, and that Colin,
fuck he's intense.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.320
Holy shit.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.200
I know, right? Crazy.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.400
That all?

26:18.040 --> 26:19.880
All done? OK, good boy.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.480
And one, two, three, lift.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.680
Here we go.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.800
Well, well, well. Ashley Molden.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.520
Or should I say Colin from Accounts?

26:34.520 --> 26:36.000
I don't want what you're
talking about.

26:36.040 --> 26:39.880
You're amazing, and your talents are
fucking wasted in the medical field.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.040
I don't think they are.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.800
Think they might be.
Thank you so much, seriously.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.440
You completely saved me.
Can we buy you a drink?

26:47.480 --> 26:50.480
Ah, Yvette's not in there?
No, she's not.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.640
And unrelated, we'll need to find
ourselves a new vet.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.560
That's a really good thing.
Yeah.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.560
Shall we?
Yeah.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.000
Um, how do you know Gene Howell?

27:00.000 --> 27:03.360
Um, how do you know Gene Howell?

27:03.400 --> 27:05.760
Gene Howell? Far out.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.520
I haven't spoken to him for years.
Right.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.440
Yeah. Is he OK?
Yeah, he's fine.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.320
He happens to be my, um, prac
supervisor at the hospital.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.480
Ace.
Yeah. Ace?

27:16.520 --> 27:18.280
Yeah, I stand by Ace.
OK.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.480
Yeah.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.600
You didn't mention you had cancer.

27:24.080 --> 27:28.480
Um, didn't, did I? You never asked.
Yeah.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.280
And it's not super sexy.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.560
No, but it's important.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.920
Yeah, it is. So, I had it.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.240
Yeah.
It was in my nuts.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.040
I've only got one now.
OK.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.520
It's a cherry tom.
Cherry tom.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.720
It's just not my favourite thing to
talk about, that's all.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.200
Yeah, I get it.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.000
Did it have something to do with...
The other night? Yeah.

27:49.040 --> 27:52.080
That day I'd had a camera up my dick
to check out my bladder.

27:52.120 --> 27:55.120
A cystoscopy. I am very familiar
with the process.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.320
Yeah. I mean, I loved it.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.240
I tried to get another one today,
but they're closed on the weekend.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.480
Yeah.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.000
Results fine?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.080
Results fine?

28:01.120 --> 28:04.160
Yeah, clean as. Spick and span.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.720
I cannot tell you what a relief it
is to hear this.

28:08.760 --> 28:10.800
Good. Yeah, I'm relieved too.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.040
Should we get a drink?
Yes.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.080
OK, come on, Col.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.120
Come on, Colly.
Come on boy.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.280
Come on, Colly.
Come on.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.920
Good boy.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.760
So you were relieved that I had
cancer?

28:18.800 --> 28:19.920
Yes.
Come on.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.880
You've got like a cancer face.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.240
Well a remission face, surely.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.760
How many inches is Pizza Hut's
largest pizza?

28:27.800 --> 28:32.480
How many inches is Pizza Hut's
largest pizza?

28:35.960 --> 28:37.080
You alright, mate?

28:37.120 --> 28:40.160
Yeah, I'm alright.
Looking for Colin from Accounts.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.000
Yes.
Um...

28:43.040 --> 28:45.880
Yes, no. He's gone home,
but I can take a message.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.640
Oof!

28:49.720 --> 28:50.880
That's my message.
Oi!

28:50.920 --> 28:52.080
Oh yeah, yeah.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.560
You tell him Dave from the Glenmore
is happy to pay his invoices...

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
You're Dave.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.120
..but next time to use his fucken
manners.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.080
Yeah, man. Yep, yep.

29:00.120 --> 29:02.440
Jesus.
All good?

29:02.480 --> 29:04.760
Yeah, all good.
All good. We're all good!

29:04.800 --> 29:07.520
Alright guys, let's take five.
Keep up the vibes.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.800
It's Saturday night!

29:08.840 --> 29:11.280
What the fuck did you say to
that guy?

29:11.320 --> 29:14.480
I didn't say anything. I didn't.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.440
I...I think Colin was a bit of a
cunt, though.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.560
Oh, OK.
Are you OK?

29:20.600 --> 29:21.840
Bit winded, mate.

29:23.640 --> 29:26.080
I think you might need to see a
doctor tonight.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.360
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Yeah.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.640
Do you know any?

29:30.680 --> 29:32.760
I sleep with one.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.800
Myself.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.720
I sleep with myself.
Very good.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.360
Well...oh!

29:38.400 --> 29:39.960
That really hurt, didn't it?
Yes, it did.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.520
Yeah, it did.
He got ya.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.120
But he did pay.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.520
He paid.
I'll take it.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.360
You're welcome.
Cheers.

29:48.560 --> 29:49.840
Give me a minute.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.040
Yeah. I'll take yours.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.440
# When you look my way

29:54.480 --> 29:56.480
# I can't help it but I start to sway

29:58.680 --> 30:00.000
# God forbid that you should ever
come my way

30:00.000 --> 30:01.840
# God forbid that you should ever
come my way

30:04.040 --> 30:07.720
# Every night I dream I see you on
the pillow next to me

30:09.120 --> 30:11.800
# And I only wanna be the one to say

30:14.280 --> 30:17.200
# I only wanna keep you around...

30:19.200 --> 30:20.520
# Around

30:20.560 --> 30:23.240
# Keep you around...

30:24.840 --> 30:26.720
# Around

30:28.360 --> 30:32.640
# Can't forget what you said when you
walked over to my car... #

30:32.680 --> 30:35.680
