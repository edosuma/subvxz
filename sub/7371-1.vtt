01:10.800 --> 01:13.530
Advertising and promotional
expenditures...

01:13.700 --> 01:18.210
...of $2.845.000...

01:18.300 --> 01:19.700
...were reported.

01:19.870 --> 01:22.810
These expenditures were primarily...

01:22.970 --> 01:27.540
...by "primarily," I mean about
96 percent of these expenditures...

01:27.710 --> 01:30.810
...were for Richter's
two main retail brands.

01:30.980 --> 01:34.280
These brands made up
over 85 percent...

01:34.450 --> 01:38.350
...of the company profits
in the last fiscal year.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.390
An increase of some 14 percent
from the previous year.

01:42.560 --> 01:48.500
This increase is based on sales
of $ 16.800.000.

01:48.670 --> 01:52.000
Total sales were up only $200.000...

01:52.170 --> 01:54.360
...in the last fiscal year.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.060
Even with an increase
in advertising expenditures...

01:57.240 --> 02:00.240
...of $872.000.

02:00.950 --> 02:03.180
So while the sales...

02:03.450 --> 02:07.940
...of Whiz Bam and Cherry Poppie Balls
are up...

02:08.120 --> 02:12.080
...sales for their retail brand,
Chocorama...

02:14.090 --> 02:15.320
Yeah, Smith.

02:15.490 --> 02:17.020
Gumball.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.420
Would you repeat that?

02:19.600 --> 02:21.200
Gumball.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.170
Okay, let's wrap it up for today,
gentlemen. Thank you.

02:27.340 --> 02:28.940
Gumball!

02:32.880 --> 02:34.900
Will you take a look at this for me?

02:40.080 --> 02:41.310
Here we go.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.040
To him who accepts the challenge.

02:44.620 --> 02:47.350
- Know what he's talking about?
- To him who risks all...

02:47.530 --> 02:50.260
...comes the satisfaction of victory...

02:50.430 --> 02:54.330
...and a sense of physical
well-being in return for...

02:54.500 --> 02:55.900
I want you to get this.

02:56.070 --> 03:00.000
In return for hardship...

03:00.200 --> 03:03.940
...exhaustion, discomfort.

03:04.110 --> 03:07.670
Ponos. Thank you very much.

03:25.430 --> 03:26.860
- Hi, Sam.
- Bannon.

03:27.030 --> 03:28.330
It's on. We're go.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.370
Look, I've been giving this matter
a lot of thought...

03:32.540 --> 03:35.630
...and look, you don't
have anything to lose.

03:35.810 --> 03:38.100
I mean, to you this thing is just a stunt.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.440
I've got a position at this university.
I've got a shot at tenure.

03:41.610 --> 03:44.880
All I have to do is stay out of trouble
a couple more years.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.280
I can't risk that.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.080
It's not a risk.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.980
It's a challenge.

03:50.150 --> 03:53.180
Hey, get out of the way!
What's the matter with you? Are you deaf?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.760
I can't eat with all this noise going on.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.360
Come on. Let's take him.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.470
Car 34, come in.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.000
This is car 34, over.

04:11.180 --> 04:13.200
Yeah, we got a telegram for you clowns.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.870
Does "gumball" mean anything to you?

04:17.380 --> 04:19.540
Negative, 10-4.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.150
Let's go.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.390
- Beside the point.
- I've got chicken in the oven.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.830
Hi, Oscar.
The kids' clothes are all laid out.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.490
Okay, don't worry.
Just have a good time.

04:40.670 --> 04:42.300
- I will.
- Bye, Oscar. See you.

04:42.470 --> 04:45.030
- Have a good time.
- Kids, be good. Listen to your daddy.

04:45.210 --> 04:47.470
You'd think she was planning
the D-day invasion...

04:47.650 --> 04:49.640
...instead of a weekend in the country.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.110
Attention, please. All passengers...

05:24.280 --> 05:26.550
Excuse me. Thank you.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.210
Hi. Smoking.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.050
Be careful. Be careful.

05:33.260 --> 05:38.820
Andy, you know how often my wife
tried to get me to get rid of this car?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.970
Well, that's German machinery for you.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.620
The car outlasted her.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.530
Sedately, Barney...

05:48.710 --> 05:50.970
...as befits our years and station in life.

05:51.140 --> 05:52.940
Of course.

06:09.060 --> 06:12.260
Ace Preston, Mr. Guts himself,
is in the white car revving up.

06:12.430 --> 06:16.090
He will attempt the death-defying
Russian T-bone.

06:17.270 --> 06:22.100
There he goes,
and where he stops nobody knows.

06:22.270 --> 06:25.870
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ace Preston on the high speed.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.840
Go, Ace, go.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.010
Ladies and gentlemen...

06:40.990 --> 06:43.650
- What do you say, buddy?
- I didn't have time to change.

06:43.830 --> 06:47.090
- Aren't you excited about this thing?
- No, I'll be glad when it's over.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.530
Well, I don't expect to live forever.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.290
Don't worry, kid, you won't.

07:05.220 --> 07:09.310
Excuse me, may I give you a flower?
I am a stranger in this country.

07:09.490 --> 07:13.180
And I've never seen
such a beautiful woman in all my life.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.920
You see, I would like to know,
maybe you could inform me of a...

07:17.090 --> 07:20.690
Here we are, old buddy.
New York, New York. The Big Apple.

07:20.860 --> 07:22.350
I feel ready. I'm pumping up.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.400
I feel pumped up.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.570
Yeah.

07:27.540 --> 07:28.940
Franco.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.840
- Fine, thank you, and you?
- Good.

07:33.010 --> 07:36.070
- How's the bambino?
- She's full of gas. She's wait for you.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.840
Hey, you make a good Italian.

07:47.730 --> 07:50.490
Lieutenant Roscoe?
Mike Pakowsky, N.Y.P.D.

07:50.660 --> 07:52.130
- How are you?
- The car's outside.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.390
I'll take you downtown now.

07:54.930 --> 07:57.400
I got a brother-in-law in L.A.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.630
Two marties and a double Man.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.800
Gumball.

09:42.470 --> 09:46.030
They're coming in now.
All of them.

09:46.810 --> 09:49.440
I'm gonna stay here on the stakeout.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.780
It's 9:05.
I'll check in again at 10.

09:53.950 --> 09:55.350
Graves.

09:56.690 --> 09:58.710
In through that way.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.290
Right through that door
there's a banquet room.

10:05.460 --> 10:07.160
Thank you.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.340
- It's just a misunderstanding.
- That's what you call it.

10:56.510 --> 10:59.210
I call it a lie.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.560
- It's after 9:30. That's the deadline.
- Shall we close it up, Mr. Bannon?

11:15.730 --> 11:19.790
Yeah. Put Fred on the door.
I want that room sealed.

11:38.060 --> 11:41.220
Ladies, gentlemen...

11:41.990 --> 11:45.450
...you have been selected because
you have the necessary skills.

11:46.560 --> 11:50.000
You are here because you have
the determination to succeed.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.660
Now, it won't be as easy as last year.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.000
There are some who will use
any means to try and stop us.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.410
Some of you won't make it.

12:00.580 --> 12:02.440
For those of you who do...

12:02.610 --> 12:05.480
...there will be no glory, no headlines.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.250
But...

12:07.990 --> 12:12.350
...just a few magic hours
flat-out against the red line...

12:12.520 --> 12:14.650
...with no catalytic converter...

12:14.830 --> 12:17.660
...and no 55-mile-an-hour speed limit.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.860
Ladies and gentlemen...

12:21.630 --> 12:23.830
...the Gumball Rally has begun.

12:29.110 --> 12:32.270
For those of you who've never
done this before...

12:32.780 --> 12:35.510
...I think I better go over the rules.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.520
The first thing to remember
is that there are no rules.

12:41.820 --> 12:45.750
The first vehicle to reach the parking lot
at the Queen Mary in Long Beach...

12:45.920 --> 12:48.980
...is the winner, the unofficial winner.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.390
Because this is an unofficial race.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.830
And so it follows that none of us
are really in this race.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.870
We don't want any civilian involvement.
No accidents, please.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.510
Remember, it's 2900 miles.

13:03.770 --> 13:09.300
That, 34 hours and 11 minutes,
is the record.

13:10.250 --> 13:14.210
Set last year by our dear friend
Mr. Bannon.

13:19.060 --> 13:21.720
Now I know we all ought
to get some rest tonight.

13:21.890 --> 13:23.420
But may I?

13:23.990 --> 13:26.090
I'd like to propose a toast.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.990
To internal combustion...

13:30.470 --> 13:32.700
...and wind in the face.

13:44.750 --> 13:49.710
You know, I think Roscoe's got a grudge
against you, Smitty, from last year.

13:50.690 --> 13:53.350
Hey, why do I always get blamed
for everything anyway?

13:53.520 --> 13:56.050
Because you're a schemer.

13:56.230 --> 13:59.060
It's gonna be a lot different
from last year anyway, you know.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.720
Yeah, I noticed.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.420
- You brought a real ringer with you.
- A what?

14:03.600 --> 14:06.160
Well, you know, your friend Franco.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.200
What do you mean? What's he ever won?

14:08.370 --> 14:11.400
Le Mans, Grand Prix de Monaco,
what does that mean?

14:11.580 --> 14:14.600
He's coming along
because he's a real nice guy.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.480
It's like trying to kill
a butterfly with a hammer.

14:17.650 --> 14:20.740
Oh, stop, will you?
You make me feel ashamed of myself.

14:20.920 --> 14:25.250
Oh, Smitty, don't worry.
Sam and I will do our best.

14:25.420 --> 14:28.360
But isn't it funny, though,
sometimes in life when your best...

14:28.530 --> 14:33.160
...just isn't quite good enough,
you know?

14:33.330 --> 14:35.230
- You're still bitter?
- No. No, I'm not.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.700
- Oh, yes, you are.
- No. I'm...

14:37.870 --> 14:40.740
I'm gonna win, that's all.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.270
Don't get overconfident.

14:47.410 --> 14:51.350
Let's flip to see
who takes care of Roscoe.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.350
Oh, yeah, right.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.480
- Tails.
- Wrong.

14:55.650 --> 14:59.950
- Oh, no. Why do I always get him?
- Take care of him the morning of the race.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.210
Mr. McAllister, Mr. Donahue.

15:24.210 --> 15:25.650
Here you are, sir.

15:25.820 --> 15:28.310
Barney, I'm hungry.

15:29.390 --> 15:31.480
- Sorry, sweetheart.
- Bull's-eye.

15:31.660 --> 15:33.450
Hit the trunk, old buddy.

15:36.190 --> 15:39.030
Lookie here. Extra uniforms.
All of them for along the way.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.390
Look at this. Police decals.
All you gotta do is stick them on the doors.

15:43.970 --> 15:46.400
Hey, give me a hand with the lights.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.470
Give it a try.

15:59.580 --> 16:00.810
Can you imagine?

16:01.280 --> 16:03.280
Do you believe that?

16:07.660 --> 16:10.350
You guys, listen to this.
Look, I been figuring...

16:10.530 --> 16:12.320
...with 200 gallons of gas back here...

16:12.500 --> 16:14.660
...we don't have to make
one damn stop, not one.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.700
- Ever seen anything like this?
- No, nice.

16:16.870 --> 16:18.990
Wait till you hear it run, man.

16:28.610 --> 16:30.580
I got that computer information en route.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.610
The weather and the traffic
and the road conditions.

16:44.730 --> 16:46.750
What's the matter, Jose?

16:46.930 --> 16:48.520
Nothing, Mr. Bannon. I'm okay.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.100
Hey, don't let all this stuff get you down.

16:51.270 --> 16:53.500
Hey, I'm fine. What do I care?

16:53.670 --> 16:56.040
I mean, if I wanted to go, I could go.

16:56.210 --> 16:58.200
I mean, it's a free country, right?

16:58.380 --> 17:02.240
I mean, this whole race is unofficial,
so I'm as unofficial as you are.

17:02.410 --> 17:05.250
See, if I wanted to go, I'd go.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.310
If I had a car.

17:11.190 --> 17:13.210
It's my girlfriend, you see.

17:13.390 --> 17:16.990
She tells me yesterday,
"No more dates on the subway."

17:17.329 --> 17:21.160
I tell you something.
In this country, you ain't nothing...

17:21.329 --> 17:24.099
...if you got no wheels.

17:24.270 --> 17:27.000
Oh, I don't know.
You been on the roads lately?

17:30.070 --> 17:31.600
The age of the motorcar is over.

17:31.780 --> 17:35.180
- Hey, is it okay if I take a few hours off?
- Sure.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.940
Okay, kill it. Kill it.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.780
Hurry up. I'm gonna have to redo
everything you've done.

17:50.260 --> 17:54.890
Gee, Mike, what'd you think
this was, a vintage-car event?

17:55.070 --> 17:59.560
Well, Smitty, some things
get meaner as they get older.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.300
Well, it's real cute. Very fast.

18:03.470 --> 18:05.300
Very uncomfortable.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.140
That's good, though. It's macho.
That's good for you.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.820
That old Smitty. You know,
we've been competing in everything:

18:15.990 --> 18:17.750
Sports, school, girls.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.820
Twenty years of competition
can sometimes get out of hand.

18:20.990 --> 18:23.690
Why didn't he buy
the rest of the Ferrari team?

18:24.190 --> 18:27.630
- I'm not so sure he didn't.
- Hey, where is that Italian flash anyway?

18:27.800 --> 18:30.990
Franco? Hasn't showed up all day.

18:31.170 --> 18:34.800
- He's probably resting up.
- Yeah, getting his plugs cleaned.

19:02.770 --> 19:06.290
I must go now, my darling.

19:06.470 --> 19:08.300
Will you write?

19:08.470 --> 19:09.940
If I can.

19:10.110 --> 19:13.940
I mean, I never met anyone
who's gone to Borneo.

19:14.110 --> 19:16.810
It is not a pleasure trip.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.510
Be careful, Franco.

19:19.680 --> 19:24.180
I cannot do the work I must
and also be careful.

19:25.090 --> 19:28.920
- Then be lucky.
- That's better.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.890
This is Red Fox to Barracuda.

20:16.070 --> 20:18.510
Red Fox to Barracuda.

20:19.310 --> 20:22.800
Now, I figure they're gonna leave late
tonight or early tomorrow morning.

20:23.310 --> 20:25.440
As soon as I see them go,
I'll let you know.

20:25.620 --> 20:30.420
And I want roadblocks on every bridge
and tunnel going west. Do you copy?

20:41.360 --> 20:45.730
Now, as the contract reads,
no driving after 6 p.m.

20:45.900 --> 20:49.170
Not to exceed 55 miles per hour.

20:50.910 --> 20:53.310
- You're bonded?
- Of course.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.240
Mr. Blakely is a connoisseur
of fine automobiles.

20:56.410 --> 21:01.010
But for California driving,
he's especially fond of this one.

21:02.590 --> 21:03.790
Minga.

21:04.190 --> 21:05.850
You may go.

21:06.860 --> 21:07.860
Sure.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.900
Gently, gently.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.840
Drive carefully.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.230
Jesus. It's a hit.

21:57.010 --> 22:00.070
We still haven't got the food.
What are we gonna eat?

22:10.020 --> 22:13.960
Oh, Franco, where you been? Your mother
called. She's been looking for you.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.850
Now you make jokes on my mother?

22:17.290 --> 22:19.820
No, no, about your mother,
not on your mother, Franco.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.460
I wouldn't get on your mother.

22:21.630 --> 22:25.430
Just like in Monte Carlo. Jokes.

22:25.600 --> 22:30.230
You insult me, you insult my family,
you insult my country...

22:30.410 --> 22:33.200
...my honor, my dignity you insult!

22:33.380 --> 22:35.740
I warned you!

22:35.910 --> 22:37.570
But you wouldn't listen!

22:39.150 --> 22:41.450
No more jokes.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.550
You see this?

22:45.290 --> 22:48.090
No more jokes!

22:55.500 --> 22:56.760
Very good, Franco.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.430
- You like?
- Yeah, it's very nice.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.070
Where is the...? The professore.

23:02.240 --> 23:05.770
Professore in the pee-pee.

23:05.940 --> 23:07.600
Are you always like this?

23:08.440 --> 23:12.040
Franco is ready.
The race can begin.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.780
Here we go, Andy.

23:17.890 --> 23:20.360
Porsche, two.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.190
- Good for you.
- Six for the Dodge.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.660
- All right.
- Cobra, four.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.960
Three, Ferrari.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.400
Jaguar, 10.

23:37.510 --> 23:39.340
Take your number there.

23:39.510 --> 23:41.200
Number one.

23:44.780 --> 23:46.940
Number eight. Who's holding eight?

23:47.120 --> 23:49.550
It's Lapchik, the lone eagle.

23:49.990 --> 23:52.890
Those are your starting positions.
Jose will start every vehicle.

23:53.220 --> 23:55.250
You got something to do.

23:55.830 --> 23:58.760
You're starting times will be
registered here and in Long Beach.

23:58.930 --> 24:01.560
And your elapsed time will all be verified.

24:01.730 --> 24:04.060
So that's it. Let's get some rest.

24:40.070 --> 24:41.900
It's done, brother.

25:44.900 --> 25:45.900
Go.

25:47.570 --> 25:49.400
Okay. Get ready.

25:49.670 --> 25:52.070
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.950
And now, my friend...

26:07.120 --> 26:10.850
...the first rule of Italian driving.

26:14.230 --> 26:17.530
What's behind me is not important.

26:27.310 --> 26:30.180
Buddy, here's to us,
and that we get there first.

26:30.350 --> 26:34.720
Give New York one of those famous
rebel yells of yours when we hit the street.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.150
You know, just to start my blood.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.570
Camaro, 6:00. Go.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.360
- Porsche, 6 and 10.
- Go.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.490
- It's going down.
- Off.

27:24.930 --> 27:26.900
What's the matter with you?
Where are you?

27:28.070 --> 27:31.400
- Cobra, 6:00 and 30 seconds.
- Go.

27:35.310 --> 27:37.440
They're not gonna do it again.

27:37.610 --> 27:40.280
Mercedes, 6 and 40. Go.

28:01.270 --> 28:02.700
You animal.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.020
51 st Street.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.860
Bravo. Times Square.

29:50.750 --> 29:51.970
It's gonna be a nice day.

29:55.990 --> 29:57.350
Good morning.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.950
Good morning to you.

30:08.060 --> 30:11.500
Miserable son of a bitch.
Hey, fella, can you loan me a dime?

30:11.670 --> 30:14.000
- Drop your pants.
- Look, I'm a cop on the job.

30:14.170 --> 30:16.400
I'm Robin Hood.

30:16.570 --> 30:18.630
- Drop them.
- Okay.

30:18.810 --> 30:20.500
- Real easy, fella.
- Drop them.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.340
It's okay, it's okay.

30:22.580 --> 30:25.550
Okay, just stay calm.

30:32.020 --> 30:34.220
Honk if you're horny.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.930
Hit it.

30:42.030 --> 30:43.430
Hit it.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.200
Put your foot in it.

30:50.270 --> 30:53.640
- You can't go back. It's one-way.
- What do you want me to do?

30:53.810 --> 30:56.280
- Will you calm down?
- You should've checked the route.

30:56.450 --> 30:58.970
I mean, wait, you blaming me?

31:00.420 --> 31:02.580
Damn it. This is one-way too.

31:02.750 --> 31:05.410
I am only going one way.

31:05.590 --> 31:09.490
Wake up, meatheads. Another great day
is starting in New York City, the Big Apple.

31:09.660 --> 31:13.920
Get up, get ready, the Giants won
7-zip, believe it or not.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.790
The Age of Aquarius is really on us.

31:15.970 --> 31:20.560
Now, the Eastern Standard Time
is five minutes past 6:00.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.840
You wanna go fast?

31:35.720 --> 31:38.850
No, that's all right.
We got plenty of time.

32:11.990 --> 32:13.890
Hey! Watch where you're going!

32:26.600 --> 32:29.900
Now we take a left over here, right?
But we gotta go left.

32:30.310 --> 32:33.670
Look out, Joe! You're gonna ruin the car.
What's the matter with you?

32:33.840 --> 32:36.000
Will you take it easy for God sakes?

32:36.180 --> 32:38.010
Joey, slow down a minute.

32:46.490 --> 32:49.010
- Wait a minute. Make a left.
- I'm not lost, so shut up.

32:58.700 --> 33:01.690
Hey, did you know
there's a hole back there?

33:01.870 --> 33:03.470
No shit.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.700
And a hungry smile.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.610
Can you look hungry?
This is Uncle Bruce.

33:09.610 --> 33:14.280
Hussy, get hungry. Hungry,
$ 150-a-night hungry, for me.

33:14.450 --> 33:17.180
You know the feeling.
Good, good, I like that. I love that.

33:17.520 --> 33:22.180
I love that look. Fan. Hungry fans.
Click. Thank you. Thank you.

33:22.360 --> 33:25.050
That's the end of the session.
It's been all right.

33:32.870 --> 33:35.600
Hey, baby. How do you like it?

33:35.770 --> 33:37.760
Oh, terrific. You stole it, right?

33:37.940 --> 33:40.000
Come on, I'm in a rush. Come on, get in.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.940
Let me have that, here.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.780
- So how do you like it, huh?
- This is real class.

33:50.950 --> 33:52.820
I mean, real class.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.750
Come on, turn it on.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.190
- What, is this the switch?
- That's it.

34:05.230 --> 34:06.860
Hey, maybe we should wait.

34:07.370 --> 34:10.360
Christ, if this thing works...

34:32.659 --> 34:34.030
Some city you got here.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.260
I didn't know what size.
I said, better too big than too little.

34:37.429 --> 34:39.300
- Did you get any?
- We didn't put it up.

34:39.469 --> 34:42.130
- We were waiting to hear from you.
- They snipped my radio.

34:42.300 --> 34:44.699
- How about your car?
- The wheels fell off.

34:44.870 --> 34:46.969
Oh, those guys sound mean.

34:47.780 --> 34:50.440
- Take me to the airport.
- Now?

34:52.179 --> 34:54.980
Hey, you gotta learn
to roll with the punches, Roscoe.

34:56.889 --> 34:58.850
Harold, how you been?

34:59.520 --> 35:01.790
Hey, that's Crazy Harold.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.420
How long do we have to drive anyway?

35:07.900 --> 35:10.020
If we're lucky, about 35 hours.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.690
- Where we going, Cuba?
- No, Long Beach, California.

35:16.310 --> 35:17.530
- Stop.
- No, I can't.

35:17.710 --> 35:20.110
No, no, stop.
You pull over to the side and stop.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.300
- Let me out.
- I forgot to tell you something.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.210
- I'm in a race, and I can't go back.
- I don't care.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.910
- I'm getting out.
- You gotta stay.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.880
- Just pull over, or I'm jumping.
- No, wait a minute.

35:30.050 --> 35:32.040
Close that door.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.790
Take it easy, now. Just take it easy.
We'll get there.

35:38.590 --> 35:44.560
From the garage to the Jersey Turnpike,
six minutes, 58 seconds.

35:44.730 --> 35:48.830
- That's 15 seconds better than last year.
- Terrific.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.000
You got the snooper working?

35:54.740 --> 35:57.640
- Get a weather report on the CB.
- You got it.

35:57.810 --> 36:00.840
All you truckers out there,
this is Big Ben in Jolly Green.

36:01.020 --> 36:03.540
We got a little light snow
coming in from Pennsylvania.

36:03.720 --> 36:07.680
Roll on, yellow Camaro.

36:07.860 --> 36:10.980
Exact change, 25 cents.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.230
Well, we're heading south.
We got plenty of open road.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.730
- You're a spastic.
- I was also all-state in basketball.

36:23.110 --> 36:25.730
- That's it. No more quarters.
- Get out of the car.

36:25.910 --> 36:28.340
- You got a quarter?
- Get out of the car.

36:31.050 --> 36:32.810
Get that tin can out of the way.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.970
- Where do you think it is?
- Under the car.

36:37.150 --> 36:39.640
- What?
- Under the car.

36:39.820 --> 36:42.620
If I was a quarter, where would I be?
Where did it go?

36:57.370 --> 37:00.360
Pull on through. Park in section D.

37:05.280 --> 37:08.270
How about explaining that last move?

37:08.980 --> 37:11.920
- What's a Smokey the Bear?
- Highway patrol.

37:13.490 --> 37:17.360
- Plain brown wrapper?
- City policeman.

37:18.290 --> 37:21.460
Unmarked car? Police car.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.790
- County Mountie?
- County sheriff.

37:24.970 --> 37:27.370
- And a local yokel?
- City policeman.

37:27.900 --> 37:31.270
You're so smart. Next time out I'll
make sure you get a driver's license.

37:41.020 --> 37:45.010
Well, happy hunting, Roscoe.
Sorry about the pants.

37:48.420 --> 37:51.120
And you call yourself New York's finest.

37:51.290 --> 37:55.460
Well, I got you all out of New York.
See you later, Sir Roscoe.

37:55.630 --> 37:56.630
Taxi.

37:57.530 --> 37:59.660
- The crusade is straight ahead.
- Taxi.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.770
Now, our crew is going ahead in a plane.

38:02.940 --> 38:05.200
They got spare parts,
everything we're gonna need.

38:05.370 --> 38:08.900
Now, I've got all these stops here
marked and coordinated.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.910
Beautiful.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.920
- What the hell are you doing?
- She is magnificent.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.450
Look, this is a race, man.

38:20.620 --> 38:23.720
Some things are more important
than winning.

38:32.330 --> 38:35.430
Maybe the float's stuck.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.500
Maybe it's humidity.

38:37.670 --> 38:40.770
England is humid.

38:41.410 --> 38:44.380
I feel like Moses
at the parting of the Red Sea.

38:44.550 --> 38:47.980
- Hey, man, this is no good.
- What's the matter, huh?

38:48.150 --> 38:51.140
Well, take a look. It's too easy.

38:51.320 --> 38:54.020
Yeah. Yeah, it's too easy
until somebody nails us.

39:07.640 --> 39:11.270
This is Flying Lasagna
coming into the oven, do you copy?

39:12.170 --> 39:13.400
The oven is hot.

39:13.580 --> 39:16.940
See that gas station? Let's pull off there.

39:17.110 --> 39:20.050
Let's get ready. One man take them...

40:05.090 --> 40:08.820
- Brilliant. Brilliant.
- Thank you.

40:17.510 --> 40:18.710
- Preston?
- What do you want?

40:18.910 --> 40:20.140
I gotta take a leak.

40:20.310 --> 40:22.280
No, I won't stop
so you can take a piss.

40:27.280 --> 40:30.050
- There's a bottle in the back.
- I can't do that.

40:30.220 --> 40:33.150
- I'm not gonna stop till we need gas.
- I can't hold it, buddy.

40:36.190 --> 40:37.470
I'm telling you, use the bottle.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.800
I tried this once going 60.
Didn't work then.

40:43.970 --> 40:47.300
Well, if you're coordinated,
once you start, you won't stop.

40:50.540 --> 40:52.700
Hey. Come on.

40:52.870 --> 40:53.870
Stop.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.670
I'm getting this all over my hands.

41:00.180 --> 41:02.810
My hands are wet.

41:02.990 --> 41:07.180
You're a dumb son of a bitch sometimes.
I don't know why I hang around with you.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.190
I wouldn't have done this to you.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.710
Those dirty son of a bitches.
I hope there's tough justice in Illinois.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.280
I wanna nail them, sheriff,
and this ought to do it.

41:32.450 --> 41:35.080
- Then what?
- Then I'm gonna turn them over to you.

41:35.250 --> 41:39.050
And you can throw away the key. You'll
be doing this country a favor, that's what.

41:40.760 --> 41:43.620
Now we can start running.

41:43.790 --> 41:45.090
How's our time?

41:48.160 --> 41:49.390
Right on schedule.

41:51.130 --> 41:53.800
I wonder what old Roscoe
is doing now.

41:54.370 --> 41:56.030
Developing an ulcer.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.080
Steady, huh?

42:37.250 --> 42:39.680
She is happy.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.820
They're coming.

43:06.310 --> 43:08.610
Goddamn, was that Roscoe?

43:15.980 --> 43:18.150
I wonder if he set us up.

43:20.090 --> 43:22.420
Oh, terrific.

43:23.630 --> 43:27.360
I got them now.
Jeez, I'd love to see the look on their faces.

43:28.560 --> 43:32.400
- How fast are you going?
- Just 100.

43:32.570 --> 43:36.870
- Well, let's hit it, avanti.
- Thank you, my dear friend.

43:38.240 --> 43:41.730
- Jesus, we're going over 100 knots.
- Well, come on. Step it up, buddy.

43:43.650 --> 43:46.740
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Sir, we can't catch them.

43:46.920 --> 43:49.350
He must be going 180 miles per hour.

43:49.520 --> 43:52.350
We don't even have a fixed-wing airplane
that can catch that.

43:59.490 --> 44:01.290
Now what?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.650
Take me to the airport.

44:26.220 --> 44:28.280
It's a handsome design.

44:28.460 --> 44:30.520
I wish it ran.

44:30.690 --> 44:32.960
I'm gonna tell you.
This thing handles like a pig.

44:33.130 --> 44:35.290
It'll get better.
Wait till we use up some gas.

44:35.460 --> 44:37.290
This thing's a bear to handle.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.240
- What the hell, Harry?
- I don't know, did we break anything?

44:43.410 --> 44:45.270
- Maybe we better stop.
- Are you kidding?

44:51.780 --> 44:54.540
- I think it's all right.
- Roll on.

44:55.950 --> 44:58.580
What's wrong with him?
I think he's having a nightmare.

45:00.090 --> 45:01.820
Oh, Jesus Christ.

45:01.990 --> 45:04.480
- Fire. Fire.
- You can't outrun it, you asshole.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.090
Pull that thing off the road.

45:28.420 --> 45:30.910
I hope you learn from this experience.

45:31.090 --> 45:35.050
I made this drive once before
in 1946 in a Mercury coupe.

45:35.220 --> 45:37.820
- Is that so?
- But it's different now.

45:37.990 --> 45:42.490
- Yes, newer roads, older bodies.
- Yeah, too much, too late.

45:42.660 --> 45:46.900
But if I have to die, Andy,
I want to die trying.

45:47.070 --> 45:48.070
Good.

45:52.040 --> 45:55.600
Would you say that man Lapchik
has a certain joie de vivre?

45:55.780 --> 46:00.210
I'd say he's possessed
of a severe case of masochism.

46:30.510 --> 46:32.500
I think it was a meteor,
that's what it was.

46:32.680 --> 46:36.170
- You okay, huh? You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

46:36.350 --> 46:38.440
Who's that guy?

46:49.100 --> 46:52.070
- Keep your eye on the road.
- Just getting my rhythm up.

46:52.230 --> 46:54.100
Keep up the speed, will you?

46:54.270 --> 46:56.670
I am keeping up the speed.
It's so boring out here...

46:56.840 --> 46:58.070
...my mind's drifting.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.370
This is America, Gibson.
America's not boring.

47:00.540 --> 47:04.670
Yeah, well, motel signs, café signs,
one-way signs, "do not enter" signs...

47:04.850 --> 47:07.640
...and every other kind of sign,
it all looks the same to me.

47:07.820 --> 47:11.680
Now, back there we saw a reptile farm.
That's more right down my alley.

47:11.850 --> 47:13.380
Get my hands on a boa contractor.

47:13.560 --> 47:17.690
The word is "constrictor."
And don't slow down. Move it.

47:17.860 --> 47:22.300
- Why did I pick him for a mechanic?
- Because I'm the best, that's why.

47:22.460 --> 47:25.630
Oh, what in the name of farm corn
did he come from?

47:28.400 --> 47:30.460
I told you to keep your eyes on the road.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.770
How am I supposed to keep my eyes
on the road, have a good time...

47:33.940 --> 47:36.430
...think about my girlfriend
and do all that? Tell me.

47:36.610 --> 47:39.410
You're a product of too much inbreeding.

47:40.780 --> 47:42.220
Watch out, P.D.

47:42.380 --> 47:43.720
Hit it. You got yours.

47:43.890 --> 47:46.580
It's those damn fake cops.

47:47.160 --> 47:51.490
- Will you move it now?
- Damn it if you can't take a joke.

47:52.090 --> 47:53.490
I wanna go home.

47:53.660 --> 47:57.220
You say you wanna be a movie star,
that you wanna be somebody.

47:57.400 --> 48:01.030
I mean, you take acting classes,
you take dance classes, you work hard.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.730
Where the hell do you think
you're gonna be discovered?

48:03.910 --> 48:07.240
Standing on a corner in Queens?

48:08.510 --> 48:11.780
I mean, baby, listen, now...

48:11.950 --> 48:13.780
...in Hollywood.

48:15.380 --> 48:18.910
- Do you really think so?
- Baby, I really like you.

48:20.960 --> 48:23.790
You should try to be nice to me.

48:25.160 --> 48:28.290
You know, you should try to understand.

48:30.830 --> 48:31.830
I do.

48:37.140 --> 48:39.270
What are you doing?

48:40.480 --> 48:42.670
What are you doing?

48:50.020 --> 48:51.540
Don't grab the wheel.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.160
Brake!

49:04.670 --> 49:05.890
Hey, you!

49:06.070 --> 49:08.370
Jesus Christ.

49:09.300 --> 49:11.770
Whitey, Whitey, you okay, boy?
Talk to me.

49:16.080 --> 49:19.840
Hello out there, this is Hoosier.
I'm a-coming in from the Cactus Patch.

49:20.010 --> 49:21.480
Rolling on to Derby City.

49:21.650 --> 49:24.210
Got Smokeys all over 40
giving out green stamps...

49:24.390 --> 49:26.850
...as you ride the cloverleaf
into the Buckeye, hear?

49:27.020 --> 49:30.120
You can put the hammer down
and watch out for two little beavers...

49:30.290 --> 49:33.620
...in a black speedboat
coming your way, as they are broken.

49:33.800 --> 49:36.060
They got ears. Do you copy?

49:36.230 --> 49:39.860
That damn Smith.
He's the one who links up all this mess.

49:40.030 --> 49:43.400
He's a damned overaged juvenile delinquent,
and I want him.

49:43.570 --> 49:46.900
- I wanna suspend his license in perpetuity.
- Who's Smith?

49:47.080 --> 49:50.170
The thorn in my side, captain.
The cloud over my head.

49:58.890 --> 50:03.550
Baker spotted them about five miles back.
They should be here soon. They're flying.

50:15.500 --> 50:18.770
They must be doing over 160.
I never saw anything so damn fast.

50:18.940 --> 50:23.070
I got them. Get everybody in position.

50:24.010 --> 50:26.000
Come on, let's go get them.

50:32.890 --> 50:35.190
See this truck up here?

50:35.360 --> 50:38.450
Pull in behind it and blow the horn.

50:55.740 --> 50:57.740
Fantastic.

50:58.310 --> 50:59.580
I thought you'd like that.

50:59.750 --> 51:01.870
Bravo, bravo!

51:45.890 --> 51:47.220
Maybe they stopped.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.630
Send a car up the road.

51:59.670 --> 52:02.510
- What's up?
- Any speeders pass you back there?

52:02.680 --> 52:06.140
- Nobody passed me within 15 miles.
- Okay, get out of here.

52:06.310 --> 52:08.010
What happened? Somebody rob a bank?

52:08.180 --> 52:11.050
None of your damn business.
Just move it out.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.490
There's no sign of them anywhere.

52:25.600 --> 52:29.660
Well, they couldn't just
have vanished into thin air.

52:33.710 --> 52:36.540
I'll be a son of a...

52:39.650 --> 52:42.140
Where are you going?

53:25.090 --> 53:26.620
Follow me.

53:33.740 --> 53:35.400
Open it up.

53:35.570 --> 53:37.130
Open it!

53:44.450 --> 53:46.280
Are you happy?

53:50.920 --> 53:52.910
Get it out of here.

54:04.030 --> 54:07.800
It's so easy on these interstates.

54:07.970 --> 54:11.700
Can you imagine making this trip
at 55 miles an hour?

54:11.870 --> 54:15.810
- Fifty-five miles an hour is unsafe.
- It's boring.

54:15.980 --> 54:18.000
That's why it's unsafe.

54:18.180 --> 54:23.170
Well, it's fast enough to kill you, but it's
slow enough to make you think you're safe.

54:23.350 --> 54:25.580
What time have you got?

54:30.220 --> 54:32.780
- Six o'clock.
- Great. Twelve hours.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.950
One-third of the trip.

54:56.680 --> 54:58.780
I think it's terminal.

55:03.720 --> 55:07.220
This is Casey Kasem
on American Top 40.

55:12.430 --> 55:13.660
In Colorado Springs...

55:13.840 --> 55:17.930
...you're listening to Casey Kasem's
American Top 40, on KYFM...

55:18.110 --> 55:21.600
...where the temperature
is now 34 degrees and dropping.

55:36.860 --> 55:40.190
Hey, hey, fella. What's the matter?
You cold or something?

55:44.030 --> 55:45.520
Hey, hey.

55:46.230 --> 55:48.960
Hey, hey. Take it easy, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay.

55:49.140 --> 55:52.470
Stay calm, okay? Stay calm. Okay?

56:01.380 --> 56:03.080
Okay, Dr Pepper?

56:03.250 --> 56:05.220
- Okay.
- Chop-chop. Let's go, huh?

56:05.390 --> 56:06.980
Okay, let's make it. Hey, my man.

56:11.390 --> 56:13.330
Boy, attaboy.

56:13.790 --> 56:16.420
- There's those damn fake cops.
- They see us?

56:16.600 --> 56:18.220
Let's not wait around to find out.

56:22.570 --> 56:24.300
Yeah, it's Oklahoma.

56:24.810 --> 56:27.300
Land of the red man.
Land of the cowboy.

56:27.480 --> 56:30.040
Land of the cow and the dog.

56:32.010 --> 56:34.410
Sailing, Ace.
You're sailing, buddy.

56:34.580 --> 56:36.950
- I don't believe it.
- What?

56:37.120 --> 56:39.310
It's those guys.

56:39.490 --> 56:42.120
I think they're gonna pull the same stunt.

56:42.290 --> 56:44.120
- They must think you're stupid.
- Yeah...

56:49.460 --> 56:51.620
Boy, that car moves.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.300
Well, put it on 140.
If he catches us, I'll eat my Airedale.

57:08.850 --> 57:10.680
Hey, that's a real sheriff, man.

57:10.850 --> 57:14.510
That is a real sheriff.

57:15.320 --> 57:16.880
I'll get you, you mother...

57:30.470 --> 57:32.560
He lost his engine.

57:42.550 --> 57:46.250
Go get them, fellas. Get them.
Go get them. He went that way.

57:46.420 --> 57:49.980
Catch up to them. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

57:55.630 --> 57:59.360
I thought you said you could drive.

57:59.530 --> 58:02.590
What the hell you talking about?
There was oil there on the road.

58:20.960 --> 58:23.150
Fill it up, please.

58:30.460 --> 58:32.300
Shut it off. Shut if off.

58:34.370 --> 58:36.270
- Hello.
- Hello.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.670
- Where are you going?
- Los Angeles.

58:38.840 --> 58:40.740
- Driving all night?
- Yes.

58:40.910 --> 58:42.470
- Alone?
- Yes.

58:42.640 --> 58:46.240
- You like me?
- Yes.

58:46.550 --> 58:50.110
Excuse, one moment. Don't go away.

58:52.720 --> 58:54.810
I have a small problem.

58:54.990 --> 58:58.650
- A small problem, huh?
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure you do. Forget it...

58:58.830 --> 59:00.050
She's very sweet.

59:00.230 --> 59:03.790
- She's got breasts like ripe melons.
- Forget it, will you? Come on. Let's go.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.830
She's beautiful. She wants me now.
I cannot deny her.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.330
That's impossible.

59:08.500 --> 59:13.270
- She's so sweet. We can make up the time.
- Impossible. Forget it.

59:17.110 --> 59:21.810
- Get in the car, will you?
- No. No, no. I don't get into the car, no.

59:24.620 --> 59:25.620
Okay.

59:28.490 --> 59:30.480
I'll see you later.

59:32.090 --> 59:34.930
Arrivederci, my friend.

59:41.570 --> 59:44.970
- I hate beer.
- Yeah, you hate everything.

59:45.140 --> 59:49.510
- I'm getting real bored lately.
- What you're getting is real boring lately.

59:52.650 --> 59:54.880
- Did you see that one?
- Foreign job.

59:55.050 --> 59:57.540
- Yeah, and it had two girls in it.
- Let's go. Go, go.

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:07.280
We got a terrific stretch of road
the next 25 miles.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.230
Don't do anything weird, Joe.
The last time they locked us up.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.390
Don't worry about it.
These dollies are ready.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.410
Hey, they're kind of cute.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.850
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.
- Yeah.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.110
Maybe I'll just tease them a little bit
and have some fun.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:49.400
- Howdy, ma'am.
- Howdy, mister.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.270
Hey, where do you wind this thing up?

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.040
- Hey, you old enough to drink?
- I'm old enough to do a lot of things.

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:03.270
Did I tell you? Did I tell you? Hey,
slow that thing down. It's gonna break.

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:08.350
- What do you want to do, play doctor?
- Oh, I'm in love. I'm in love.

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:12.720
Sweetheart, if you catch me...

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:14.790
...you can have me.

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:17.420
Are you kidding?

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.000
Go. Go.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.790
Go. This is a dream come true.
Get on them.

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:25.600
- Go.
- That was really dumb.

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.110
Oh, they'll never catch up with us.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.870
Drive, Earl. Drive.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:03.840
Well, goddamn,
Franco's gonna miss all the fun.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.990
Goddamn.

01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:01.700
- Where's Franco?
- We must have lost him somewhere.

01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:05.570
It's a difficult thing to think about
at 2:00 in the morning.

01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:12.040
Well, I guess I can ease up now.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.840
Feeling better?

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:23.590
Oh, my God.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640
Well?

01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:55.820
Andy, I need an inspiration.

01:03:55.990 --> 01:04:01.450
- Yes, it's that time of morning.
- Something to make the blood hot.

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:04.100
What would you say
to a bit of Henry V?

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.930
Oh, you're a mind reader.

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:17.940
Once more into the breach, dear friends,
once more.

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:27.940
Follow your spirit,
and on this charge cry:

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:33.920
"God for Harry,
England and St. George!"

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:41.060
Christ.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.400
I hope Lapchik the mad Hungarian
sees that.

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:10.320
He came off right here.
He's gotta be down there.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.990
Man, he's gotta be down there.

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:16.470
Hey. Hey, fella, you all right?

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:41.590
They're gonna be leaving Nevada
on Interstate 15.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.930
That's the way they're gonna be coming.
Through this junction.

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.400
- We haven't had too much luck before.
- Yeah, but they were forewarned.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.440
They've got CB radios.
They can listen to everything we say.

01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:52.970
There was no way around it.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.130
I can't understand how, but they did it.

01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:57.370
This time, this time,
it's gonna be planned.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.840
- Really planned.
- Boy, you really want them bad.

01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:02.140
Gentlemen, this is Roscoe's last stand.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:06.280
Don't let go of the accelerator.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.820
For you, you lovely American animal.

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:15.660
Remember Franco.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.030
Quickest man I know.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.700
Bye. Bye.

01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:27.540
What the hell?

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:32.270
- She can drive, huh?
- Yeah. Bannon and Graves got by last night.

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:35.240
Well, let them have
their brief moment of glory.

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.580
Yeah. We'll be in Nevada pretty soon.

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.080
Nevada. Las Vegas.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:45.090
City le sensuale. The dancing girls
with the bouncing boom-booms.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:48.350
Oh, shut up, will you, with that.

01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:00.130
- Look at that piece there.
- What's that car?

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:03.240
- That's a Rolls Royce.
- Ain't she sweet.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.310
She looks lonely.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:09.480
I love it, I love it.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:14.980
Hey, come on, Angie, come on. Let's go.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.950
Come on, let's get her.

01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:26.290
Come on, cut that cleaning crap.
Get in the car.

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:29.700
- I wanna get a Coke.
- Get your ass in the car. Come on, Angie.

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:49.590
Angie.

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.380
I ain't gonna hurt you.

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:21.490
- Angie.
- Let's look at your bicentennial flag.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:34.520
Come on, baby, it's gonna be
you, you, me and all my friends.

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.330
Hey, send her out.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.080
Oh, jeez.

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:49.479
Hey, come on out, we won't hurt you.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:51.710
- Come on.
- Get out.

01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:54.580
I'm gonna get you, faggot.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.960
Go.

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:01.350
You watch that bike.

01:09:01.529 --> 01:09:03.359
I'm warning you, you little...

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:04.760
Look what you did.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.870
You got some nerve to go out
and get some Coca-Cola.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.399
Come on, go, go. Let's get them.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.640
Those pigs.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.550
Oh, shit, they coming after us.

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:26.180
Oh, you know
what's gonna happen now?

01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:28.649
They gonna rape you,
and they gonna kill me.

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:30.790
Really? Maybe they'll kill me
and rape you.

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:35.290
- Do something.
- What?

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.689
- I don't know.
- Christ, I hate this country.

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:18.700
Oh, shit. Hey, old buddy.

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.560
Wake up, man. Lookie here.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:25.300
- What now?
- Oh, Jesus.

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:29.620
Turn back 6 yards, then punt.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.540
You know, you fellows were doing
just about 90.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.310
Really?

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.450
Okay, okay, okay. Cut, cut, cut.

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:04.450
Hey. Hey, man. Was it me?

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:07.520
The line was supposed to be:

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:09.550
"Let me explain."

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.280
Oh, damn.

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:16.160
Sure is a funny-looking police car.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.560
Say...

01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:21.830
...what police department
you fellas from anyway?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.660
- None.
- Impersonating an officer, huh?

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.970
- Turn around. Stand easy against the car.
- Hey.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.700
Oh, come on.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.040
We... We're on film right now.

01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:34.270
What do you mean, you're on film?

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:36.550
What, are you making a movie?

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.680
Yeah, sure. I mean, the camera's right
up there on that mountaintop.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.290
Well, nobody informed me about that.

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:49.190
Well, that's obvious. I mean, you think
we'd be riding in this rinky-dink police car...

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.560
...with chocolate cookies on the dashboard
if it weren't for a movie?

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:56.830
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.
All I know is the law's still the law.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.630
Listen, officer, you...
I mean, absolutely, you're right.

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:02.330
I mean, we were speeding, but...

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:08.280
Oh, hey, wait a minute. This is perfect.

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:10.010
You could help us.

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:12.720
Help you? Help you do what?

01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:14.490
Sure.

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.380
Sure, the whole mise en scene...

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.360
...that leads into the exposition,
and the dénouement...

01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:23.000
...and the intention. It's perfect...
- Wait a minute.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.600
Let me get this straight.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.430
Are you trying to tell me that...

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.590
...you want me to be in your movie?

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:32.400
Well, I mean...

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:35.060
...that is, if you've got
five minutes, and...

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.800
...you know, if you'd like to be
in a Hollywood film, sure.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.840
I don't know, l...

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:44.650
Avila, call Clint and see
if they're ready, okay?

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.480
- And tell them that we have Officer...
- Williams.

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:51.110
Officer Williams here,
and we'd like to use him.

01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:54.720
God, you sure got
a good-looking smile.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.690
Okay. Hey, old buddy...

01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.990
...they wanna see his face.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.600
Officer Williams, step down here
by your car for me.

01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:03.790
- For just a second, would you, please?
- Sure.

01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:07.370
Stand over here or something. Pose.
You know, something like that, huh?

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.870
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.370
- This is preliminary stuff for the camera.
- Sure.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.030
- Focus, stuff like that.
- Sure.

01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:14.440
- How's that?
- Okay?

01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:16.740
Yeah, fine.
Just turn the chin around a little.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.440
- Yeah.
- No, no... Just a...

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.610
Just give me the chin
a little bit this way.

01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:23.450
- That...
- Oh, I see what you mean.

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.390
Yeah, you got it.

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:28.260
God, you got a great profile.

01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:30.860
Hey, old buddy, they got it
and they say it's A-okay.

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:32.260
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.130
Listen, this is what we're gonna do.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:37.630
Avila and I are gonna get in the car
and go down about two miles, okay?

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.100
We're gonna turn around
and come barrel-assing...

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:41.500
...back through this way.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.770
- Then you get in your...
- I get in my car and chase you.

01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:46.970
You got it, that's it. Perfect.

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:50.810
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't I gotta put on some makeup?

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:52.650
Makeup?

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:57.650
Hey, does Charlie Bronson wear makeup?

01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.660
Charlie who?

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:02.990
Bronson.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.360
Oh, yeah. That little guy. Right.

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:08.970
- All right, buddy. Let's go, they're rolling.
- Oh, okay.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:14.330
Scene 14, take two, hand mark.

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:21.280
Come on, now.
Let me see those pearly whites. Smile.

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:24.650
That's it. Action.

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.120
God, can't you turn off the heater?

01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:14.890
Either the engine gets hot, or we get hot.

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.990
Well, I'm gonna have a stroke.

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.890
You're gonna have a stroke?
I should be so lucky.

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:22.630
Because if you don't stop
playing that music...

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:27.570
I can't stand you!

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:30.170
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!

01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:42.250
I liked Joe.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.820
He was sweet.

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:50.360
Aren't you gonna talk to me anymore?

01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:56.070
You gotta admit,
he was a good mechanic.

01:16:56.670 --> 01:16:59.370
He fixed the car faster than we could.

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:01.270
Furthermore...

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.410
...we didn't lose much time.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.540
We made time, as a matter of fact.

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.870
It was love at first sight.

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.250
Are you crazy?
Love at first sight?

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.820
Out there? The middle of the night?
The middle of a field under the stars?

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:22.250
A girl can't always find
the perfect spot.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:17.670
I think Roscoe's gonna give it
one more try before L.A.

01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:19.610
I didn't hear anything on the radio.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.210
- Maybe he's getting smart.
- Howdy.

01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:23.590
Howdy.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.150
Couldn't help but overhear
your conversation.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.350
Wrong, thank you.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.920
- I'm gonna get back on the road.
- No, no.

01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:33.530
Too many police cars
go down the road this morning.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.290
- See where they went?
- Nope...

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:37.860
...but I could find out.

01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:40.000
Well, you got a deal.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.930
You guys seem to need a rabbit.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.540
- Are you volunteering?
- Oh, listen, listen.

01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:52.240
I play, but l... I play for pay.

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:56.880
You want the road cleared out,
it's gonna cost you $500 cash...

01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:58.350
...paid in advance.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.120
Five hundred dollars, paid in advance?

01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:02.550
Could be worth it.

01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:04.190
Yeah, well...

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.620
...suit yourselves, okay?

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.360
What the hell's
the matter with him?

01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:59.070
Don't make babies like this anymore.

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.940
Give me six for the lead time, okay?

01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:09.690
That's the ugliest car I ever saw.

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:12.190
Looks like a jukebox.

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.230
Well, they got them,
right behind me yet.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.070
- Ferrari and a Cobra.
- How far back?

01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:27.610
I don't wanna talk about that.
Let's have the money, huh?

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.680
That's it, that's it.

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:31.340
There, that's good.

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.710
Thanks...

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.590
...lieutenant.
- Get out of here.

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:49.320
- Want one of those?
- No, thanks.

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.260
You know...

01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:54.670
...I smell something.
- You smell something?

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.270
Yeah, a weasel in a rabbit suit.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.530
Old Roscoe, huh?

01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:01.070
Maybe we're being too cynical.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.940
- We should be more positive, more trusting.
- Oh, get out of here, will you?

01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:07.070
Let's go.

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:12.050
Sam.

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:17.290
We're 27 minutes ahead
of last year's schedule.

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.450
But Franco's driving again.

01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:23.360
Well, with a little bit of luck
and some pure Yankee style...

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.080
All right, you two,
on the hill with the other car.

01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:39.770
All right, everybody, hear this.

01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:42.470
It's plan B. Move out.

01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:45.020
Come on, now, move out. Get moving.

01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:46.780
Number one, move it. Go in.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.950
Come on, you guys. Let's hustle it here.
Come on!

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.520
Take it out of here.

01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:33.460
How inadequate.

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:39.740
Fifty-five miles an hour, Roscoe.

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:40.910
No.

01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:52.150
Why?

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:54.750
Why me?

01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:57.820
You're an asshole, Roscoe, that's why.

01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:30.090
Well, good morning to you too.

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:32.420
How can you fall asleep?

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:35.320
It was easy, you said, "Relax."
And the car is comfortable.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.330
Comfortable? It's a $40.000 car.
Of course it's comfortable.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.560
When we get to Hollywood,
if you like it so much, I'll buy you one.

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.600
- What's the matter with you?
- Hollywood.

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:45.970
Nothing's the matter.
You're so goddamn stupid.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:49.170
You think you'll walk the streets
of Hollywood, meet a producer...

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:52.010
- What are you talking about?
- He'll make you a movie star.

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:53.650
You told me that if I went...

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.720
I told you a lot of things
because you were freaking out on me.

01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:59.580
- All I wanted you was... For you to like me.
- I like you.

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.090
- For you to be... You like me?
- Yes, I like you.

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:03.780
I been thinking all night...

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.480
...and I'll tell you what.
You ain't right for me.

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.130
You're a goddamn hustler.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.820
- That's what you are.
- You wanna know who I am?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.200
I'm the girl who's gonna
punch you in the nose.

01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:15.340
You don't understand anything about me!

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.670
What's that? What the hell is that?
Look at that.

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:21.470
- Oh, what is this?
- Slow down.

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.340
Why does it always happen to me?

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:25.310
Believe this?
Wait, I'm trying to drive.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.010
- Slow down.
- I can't. You crazy?

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:29.480
- How am I gonna slow down?
- Would you just...?

01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:31.640
I can't see. Look at...

01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:36.150
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.460
Oh, my God.

01:24:39.630 --> 01:24:41.150
Oh, this is cute.

01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:43.200
Oh, my God.

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:45.390
Look what happened.

01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:18.130
Hello, smart boy.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.710
You know what we do
to finks and traitors?

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:28.040
- It was a joke, man...
- A joke?

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.080
- Sorry, man...
- You're sorry, huh?

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:33.770
- Listen...
- After it's too late to do anything about it?

01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:37.250
I am going to mark you
with the gumball gun.

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.420
No.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.860
Now you are marked...

01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:49.790
...for life!

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.150
Vitamin C?

01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:20.420
Just for good luck.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.090
You really think we got a chance?

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.790
Hey, Roscoe.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.360
- Las Vegas, now arriving...

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:56.360
- Don't ask, Clancy.
- What happened?

01:26:56.530 --> 01:26:59.230
Look, I'm tired. All I wanna do
is go home. They beat me.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.560
- You understand?
- Didn't you nail any of them?

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:04.140
- Look, just don't ask me.
- Jesus, Roscoe, all that...

01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:06.740
- Clancy!
- Roscoe...

01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.870
...you look terrible.

01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:14.610
Well it's one of those
Los Angeles days, Gene.

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.910
We're hovering over the Civic Center.
We can see traffic backing up.

01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:20.180
We got a sig alert working
on Santa Monica...

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.190
...and the Pasadena is jammed as usual.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:26.560
Golden State's moving, but just barely.
And the Long Beach is a sea of cars.

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:28.960
Should continue to be like this
for another hour.

01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:31.790
Be advised, take surface streets
wherever possible...

01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:34.230
...and try to stay calm and composed.

01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:37.830
There must be another way.

01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:40.340
God, oh, God.

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.680
Christ.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:49.180
The engine is too hot.

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:55.560
I guess we're just a little bit
too smart for them, old buddy.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.560
That's right, my friend.
Smooth sailing to Long Beach.

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.830
Yep, I think I'll have me a cigar.

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:02.890
My wife's pregnant.

01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:05.400
- Come on, give me a hand, will you?
- Bug off, jerk.

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.260
Oh, no.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.600
Avila, no way.
I don't wanna hear it, Avila.

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:21.880
To serve and to protect, huh?

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.180
Officer. Right here.

01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:29.590
Hold it. Hold it, officer.

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:32.820
Oh, God, thank you, officer.

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.430
Help! My wife is pregnant.

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.760
She's gonna have the baby.
Her water just broke.

01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:40.900
I tried to get these...
They won't help me.

01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:43.940
They haven't helped.
Come on. Help me.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:46.600
You assholes!

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.710
Jesus, I'm grateful.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.010
- They don't even care.
- Okay, now.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:58.510
Just be cool, be calm.
We'll take care of everything.

01:28:58.690 --> 01:29:01.990
- Don't... Please don't bite my hand.
- Yeah, you!

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.320
Wait! Wait! Wait a minute.

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:08.930
We can use the river.
There's an access road to the right.

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:11.460
It runs all the way to Long Beach.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.780
- No, no. West, west.
- West?

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:31.950
West.

01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:46.190
Look at that.

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.800
Look at that. That's Bannon.

01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:52.860
What the hell? Get off of here.

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:54.730
Get off.

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.500
Where's the next one?

01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.650
On your left.

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:01.750
Okay.

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.350
Look out, you damn fool.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.640
- Right out of there.
- You're not allowed down there.

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.280
Up yours.

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.260
You can't go down there. Stop.

01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:15.020
Don't slow down, hit it.

01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:19.960
I never raced in a river before.

01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:27.370
Okay, the lights are set
for 32 miles per hour.

01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:30.710
- Right.
- Just keep going on Sepulveda.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.510
Okay, hang on.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.560
Smile.

01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:46.990
What are we going now?

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.360
Thirty-two miles an hour.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.630
Looks like we've
got some water coming up.

01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:57.500
- I don't see anything.
- How deep is it here?

01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.870
Here goes.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.870
Hold it. Keep the rims high.
Don't slow it up.

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.810
I can't see anything.

01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:16.390
Come on. Come on.
Take him. Take him.

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.490
Watch out for the slick places.

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.420
Let's go. Let's go.

01:31:43.690 --> 01:31:45.280
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:49.750
There's a real big drain coming up.

01:31:59.970 --> 01:32:02.200
Really hustle.

01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:08.370
All right, now, now.

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:09.540
Now.

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:13.440
You got him. You got him.

01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:19.390
Where do we turn?

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.920
What are they doing?
Into it, into it.

01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:25.720
Turn coming up. Turn coming up.

01:32:26.730 --> 01:32:29.030
Where's Franco now?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.600
Damn it!

01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:38.330
What do you say, Franco?

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.740
Block him on this turn.

01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:45.810
Stay on him, Sam.

01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:47.980
- Ride him. Ride him.
- Watch out.

01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:49.480
Hang on. Hang on, now.

01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:53.610
- Change your gear.
- Move, now. Move, move, move.

01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:00.020
I tell you what
the trouble is with you, Ace.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.790
You don't have a sense of humor.
This is rigged for fun.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.400
- Don't talk to me.
- Well, come on, buddy, cheer up.

01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:06.800
We're just about there.

01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:08.770
Just about smell
the Queen Mary's butt.

01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:20.880
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:27.850
Now this is style.
We'll come whipping in on two wheels.

01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:33.690
Hey, I've seen you do it 100 times.
I practiced.

01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.520
Think I can get in the show?

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:38.060
I think you're making a mistake.

01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:40.100
No, I got this on the road.

01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:55.010
Damn. Almost had it.

01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:56.740
What do you think I did wrong?

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.390
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:00.220
It's a wreck or something.

01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:03.320
It always happens when I'm in a hurry.

01:34:06.630 --> 01:34:08.820
Oh, my God.

01:34:09.230 --> 01:34:11.320
You wrecked my car, you jerk.

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.470
You dumb jerk, look at my car.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.330
What do you think you're doing?
You got a driver's license?

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.440
You people see what he did to my car?

01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:20.140
I don't care. I have no money.

01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:23.640
If you wanna put me in jail,
it's okay with me, I can use the sleep.

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:31.640
I was just about to get
the car repainted anyway.

01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:34.690
Oh, this is my girlfriend, Angie,
from New York.

01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:39.980
Are you sure everything's okay,
Mr. Blakely?

01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:43.760
You wouldn't happen to be
an actress, would you, Miss?

01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:46.370
Blanche. Why, yes. How'd you guess?

01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:49.870
Well, you have what we call...

01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:52.270
...presence.

01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:57.540
Well, if it bothers you,
I can put on my jacket.

01:34:57.710 --> 01:34:59.610
Why don't we go inside.

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.480
I have to do a lot of entertaining.

01:35:01.650 --> 01:35:04.780
I'm in the movie business,
and it's part of the game.

01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:06.420
Go, baby!

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.090
What's the matter...?
What's the matter with you?

01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:19.760
Am I clear?

01:35:19.930 --> 01:35:22.230
Yes, you're clear.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:28.110
Cut them off, cut them off.

01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:32.580
Good going.

01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:39.180
Just make it to that parking lot.

01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:40.720
It's only two miles.

01:35:40.890 --> 01:35:43.860
No problem. Relax, relax.

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:46.360
Clear on your right.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.930
There it is.

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.330
Let's hope
Emergency Plan Alpha works.

01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:05.740
Emergency Plan Alpha?

01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:13.550
Go.

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:18.090
Get them, damn it, quick.
Oh, that's a cheap move.

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.190
Terrific.

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.650
Take them.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.260
On the right. On the right.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.170
I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:46.680
Get him now.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.800
Okay.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.960
What are you doing?

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:06.540
What are you doing?

01:37:06.710 --> 01:37:08.970
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:11.480
- Hey.
- It worked. It worked.

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.010
It's a trap. Get out of here.

01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:15.740
Oh, no. Jesus.

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.980
- I'll come back.
- Wait, Franco.

01:37:28.230 --> 01:37:29.460
Franco.

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:33.800
Franco, wait. Franco.

01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:59.020
Thirty-three hours and 57 minutes.
A new record. How's that, Mike?

01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:01.790
- Great going, Sam.
- I thought you were in traffic.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.990
Smith was going down.

01:38:14.410 --> 01:38:17.210
Hey, two more.
Alice and Jane and the cops.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.280
I wanna thank my mother, my friends.
I wanna thank my loved ones, you...

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:32.820
Hey, listen, listen. I wanna thank
you guys for me and Mr. Guts.

01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:36.560
If you hadn't picked us up, we'd have
still been on the freeways of America.

01:38:36.730 --> 01:38:38.960
What do you say we celebrate, huh?

01:38:44.110 --> 01:38:45.900
Get over here.

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:56.870
Hey. Shut up. Shut up.

01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:13.160
What can I say?
It just... Just makes me sick.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.270
- Angie.
- Where did he come from?

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.740
Angie, baby.

01:39:21.610 --> 01:39:23.410
Oh, baby.

01:39:28.450 --> 01:39:30.310
Hey, Roscoe.

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.920
Roscoe.

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.750
Come on, have a drink.

01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.920
Don't add insult to injury, Bannon.

01:39:44.530 --> 01:39:45.970
Maybe next year.

01:39:46.130 --> 01:39:47.860
There isn't gonna be any next year.

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.060
I'm retiring. You're not gonna have Roscoe
to kick around anymore.

01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.830
Wouldn't be the same without you.

01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:00.070
Someday, Bannon, you and Smith.

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.950
Well, you know, I was thinking
about retiring too.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.890
No, really.

01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:37.180
It's a raid.

01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:50.760
Get those trucks over here.

01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:54.660
Hustle, hustle, hustle. Out of the way.
Come on, come on.

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.270
Okay, come on, move them out.
That's the ticket. Do that.

01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:06.970
What's going on here?

01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:10.920
Well, as of 11:00, you are illegally parked.

01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:17.120
That's according to California
Vehicle Code number 22658. 22658.

01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:25.600
- I want your name.
- Get on, man.

01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:31.730
At any rate, the fines will be levied,
and they will be hauled away.

01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.300
Perfect.

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:46.980
Move them out. That's right.
Come on, let's go.

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:48.850
Let's go.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.890
Move them out. That's the idea.

01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:59.020
Get that one going.
Come on, come on, move it along.

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.900
Move it along here. Come on.
Get out of here.

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.780
That's right, that's right. All right.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.920
Hey, hey.

01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:22.380
- We're a bit late.
- I hope we didn't miss the fun.

01:42:34.770 --> 01:42:36.500
Maybe next year.

01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:47.070
How are you gonna get back to New York?

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:50.180
I hadn't given it much thought.

01:42:59.890 --> 01:43:01.490
This is ridiculous.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.160
Where do you get cars around here?

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.930
Come on, it's America, babe.

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.730
Gumball.

01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:19.000
Gumball.

01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:20.770
- Gumball.
- Gumball.

01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:24.110
- Gumball.
- Gumball.

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:35.420
He's here.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.540
- What the hell is he doing?
- Looks like his throttle is stuck.

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.440
Oh, shit!

01:43:48.305 --> 01:43:54.576
