<i>Opa!</i>

<i>Opa! Opa!</i>

02:00.204 --> 02:01.205
<i>Opa!</i>

02:10.172 --> 02:13.175
<i>Opa! Opa!</i>

02:34.404 --> 02:36.782
<i>Ah... Opa!</i>

02:45.791 --> 02:48.877
<i>Opa! Opa!</i>

02:52.339 --> 02:54.466
<i>Everybody say
- Opa!</i>

03:03.725 --> 03:04.852
<i>Opa!</i>

03:21.743 --> 03:24.288
<i>Opa! Opa!</i>

03:30.460 --> 03:31.461
<i>Opa!</i>

03:31.461 --> 03:32.546
Mom, do you want some coffee?

03:32.546 --> 03:33.797
That's good, Maria.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.549
Hey!

03:35.549 --> 03:37.759
Oh. How's my mom today?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.429
Hi, Mom. It's me, Toula.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.639
I'm your daughter.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.268
No. My daughter is young and beautiful.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.062
Go do your homework.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.899
We've been discussing
everything with your mother.

03:51.899 --> 03:56.236
Mom? Remember when we were talking
about Toula taking a trip?

03:56.236 --> 03:59.156
I discussed it
with your father last night.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.076
I know he's gone.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.620
I'm not nuts.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.955
He was in my dream.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.125
- You're going to Greece

04:10.125 --> 04:12.920
for the reunion in your father's village.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.129
That's right. And?

04:14.129 --> 04:16.173
Because you promised your father

04:16.173 --> 04:20.469
you would give his journal
to his best friends.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.221
- Yes!
- That's right!

04:22.221 --> 04:24.681
- Mom remembers!
- See? I know. I know.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.353
It's so nice to meet you.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.565
Just kidding.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.275
I know. I know.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.489
<i>All moms pretend they're okay</i>

04:41.073 --> 04:42.658
<i>so the family won't worry.</i>

04:43.617 --> 04:45.452
<i>Because, for a mom,</i>

04:45.452 --> 04:49.748
<i>it's the badge of honor
to take care of everyone,</i>

04:49.748 --> 04:52.125
<i>especially Greek women who give birth,</i>

04:52.125 --> 04:56.171
<i>then immediately get up
and cook everyone family dinner,</i>

04:56.171 --> 04:58.549
<i>while the Greek man stands there</i>

04:58.549 --> 05:01.051
<i>and declares himself
the head of the house.</i>

05:01.718 --> 05:04.137
<i>Since we lost my dad,
the head of the house,</i>

05:04.137 --> 05:06.765
<i>it's been a while without family dinner.</i>

05:07.933 --> 05:10.769
<i>We've been feeling kind of scattered,
which is weird for us,</i>

05:10.769 --> 05:15.107
<i>because my family used to be
stuck together by our own sweat.</i>

05:17.192 --> 05:19.278
<i>That's how an immigrant family survives,</i>

05:19.862 --> 05:22.114
<i>working together, sticking together,</i>

05:23.282 --> 05:24.741
<i>running a restaurant.</i>

05:29.037 --> 05:31.081
<i>But not today.</i>

05:31.081 --> 05:33.917
<i>I am going on a vacation.</i>

05:34.585 --> 05:36.086
We're going to Greece.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.590
- Oh, yeah.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.303
It's Nick.

05:44.303 --> 05:47.222
<i>Hey, Toula, you got Dad's journal, right?</i>

05:48.307 --> 05:51.310
We're doing it, Dad.
Just came to say bye to Ma.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.811
So, Toula, who am I driving with?

05:52.811 --> 05:54.271
<i>Thea Voula and Thea Frieda.</i>

05:54.855 --> 05:57.482
A trip without my kids?
I mean, it's finally "me" time.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.902
I'm gonna look great
when I meet Dad's friends.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.445
I got some grooming to do.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.405
<i>Ma! I need some hair dye!</i>

06:03.405 --> 06:05.157
I got to use your shower!

06:05.157 --> 06:06.867
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus.

06:07.910 --> 06:08.911
See that?

06:09.786 --> 06:12.789
<i>This will be
our first time in Greece.</i>

06:12.789 --> 06:14.458
<i>My dad never went back.</i>

06:14.458 --> 06:16.335
<i>It's what immigrant parents do.</i>

06:16.335 --> 06:18.837
<i>Work hard, give it all to the kids,</i>

06:18.837 --> 06:21.131
<i>so we can take the trip they never did.</i>

06:21.131 --> 06:22.758
<i>It doesn't seem right.</i>

06:23.258 --> 06:25.427
<i>But my dad asked me to go to the reunion,</i>

06:25.427 --> 06:28.055
<i>find his friends
and give them his journal.</i>

06:28.055 --> 06:29.723
<i>It's his life story.</i>

06:30.557 --> 06:33.060
<i>My dad also told me
I better take some time off</i>

06:33.060 --> 06:34.978
<i>because I was starting to look old.</i>

06:35.771 --> 06:36.772
<i>So...</i>

06:37.439 --> 06:39.274
<i>Vacation!</i>

06:44.530 --> 06:46.615
<i>Welcome to
Chicago International Airport.</i>

06:46.615 --> 06:47.783
- Okay.
- Hello.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.284
Paris, you made it.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.786
Oh! Love the 'do.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.788
- Wow.
- How were finals?

06:53.539 --> 06:55.916
You know, I was thinking
I should stay home.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.000
- What?
- You know?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.461
No. You can see Bennett when you get back.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.505
No. No, no, no. That's over. That's done.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.048
Oh, Roscoe now. Right, right.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.133
No, Aristotle. Thea Voula set you up.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.469
- Yeah, which is why that is over, too.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.514
I just... I wanted to study this summer.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.016
Just take a break from your perfect GPA.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.393
You put too much pressure on yourself.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.602
It's Greece.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.938
For <i>Pappou. Pappou.</i>

07:17.938 --> 07:19.731
"Give me a word, any word,

07:19.731 --> 07:22.359
"and I show you how the root
of that word is Greek."

07:23.193 --> 07:24.194
"Nachos."

07:25.904 --> 07:26.905
Heh.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.116
The family came to say goodbye.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.534
- Everyone?
- Yeah.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.162
It says maximum 20 people.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.455
That's six Greeks.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.207
Everyone, suck it in.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.792
- I got it.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.016
Oh, man.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.851
Hey, snacks.

07:55.851 --> 07:58.020
You can't afford since you got fired.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.104
Retired.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.274
Eh, a Greek man retires
a week after he is dead.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.901
Hey, good one. Come on.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.027
What's that?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.198
- Let's go over the restaurant.
- I got my kids on shifts.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.741
I ordered the beef.
I ordered the fish.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.076
- Take care of my mom.
We will.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.870
- You're good cousins.
- I am.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.580
- We got to go! Bye!

08:16.580 --> 08:19.416
Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye!

08:21.543 --> 08:23.378
- Bye!
Bye!

08:28.675 --> 08:30.886
<i>Flight 204
departing for Athens.</i>

08:30.886 --> 08:33.847
Is every Greek in Chicago on this plane?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.225
Everyone going to the homeland, sit down!

08:38.101 --> 08:41.480
Ah, big family trip.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.148
Aunt Voula.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.984
I'm in charge. You report to me.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.069
Wha...

08:48.237 --> 08:50.697
I found my bikini from 1972.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.282
Oh.

08:57.454 --> 09:01.166
Who wants souvlaki?

09:01.166 --> 09:02.292
Homemade.

09:02.793 --> 09:03.794
I made it.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.171
Paging Sue Vlaki.

09:06.171 --> 09:09.466
Anybody by the name of Sue Vlaki
on this flight?

09:12.678 --> 09:14.680
Take this evil eye to protect you.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.974
Yeah, you know I don't believe
in the Greek voodoo.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.059
That's why you're still single.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.480
We found out we're related
to Alexander the Great.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.606
Me, too.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.733
- Hey!

09:26.733 --> 09:28.443
Hey. All right.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, Ian.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.781
Where you going?
Your seat's back there, right?

09:32.781 --> 09:35.117
We're trying to have
a little fun here, okay?

09:35.117 --> 09:36.577
I'm fun.

09:37.828 --> 09:38.954
When?

09:38.954 --> 09:41.248
It doesn't matter, Ian, 'cause I need
to try and get some sleep.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.002
The big button.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.139
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain.</i>

09:57.139 --> 10:00.184
<i>Please take your seats and make sure
your seatbelts are securely fastened.</i>

10:00.184 --> 10:01.518
<i>We are ready for takeoff.</i>

10:01.518 --> 10:04.062
Oh, good! My assistant is here.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.315
- Family documents.
- The family?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.319
Paris?

10:12.446 --> 10:13.989
Aristotle! What...

10:13.989 --> 10:16.158
- I didn't know you were gonna be here.
- ...are you doing here?

10:16.158 --> 10:18.493
Your Thea Voula hired me
to help her on a trip.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.204
I didn't know that you were gonna be here.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.707
That's right, they know each other.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.292
What a coincidence.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.212
Such a nice Greek boy.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.339
They had an amazing date.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.090
She ghosted him.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.344
Why can't this family
respect my boundaries?

10:35.344 --> 10:37.679
- Boundaries?
- Boundaries?

10:37.679 --> 10:38.972
I can't get any space.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.349
You want space, you got it.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.101
Forget I'm here. You won't even see me.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.189
- Can we switch?
- No. Sit down.

10:51.527 --> 10:52.861
Make up. Make out.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.113
That's Aristotle.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.241
I have to switch seats with Paris.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.492
I knew...

11:02.496 --> 11:04.081
- Let them work it out.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.290
Oh.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.000
Something else is going on with Paris.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.585
Don't. It's none of our business.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.004
Oh. We are so different.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.423
You must sit down!

11:13.423 --> 11:14.925
Or we are not going to Greece.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.388
Sit.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.640
Ah. Yeah.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.941
<i>Welcome to Athens, Greece.</i>

11:38.824 --> 11:40.993
"Coppertone," written in Greek.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.077
I mean...

11:42.077 --> 11:43.954
- Oh, man.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.873
Why haven't we done this before?

11:45.873 --> 11:48.917
Uh, hello to everyone
I haven't met. I'm Aristotle.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.377
Car rental is this way.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.087
- Actually, I think it's this way.
- Very smart.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.089
- No, no, no, no, I think they said...

11:54.089 --> 11:55.424
You came!

11:55.424 --> 11:57.551
You are the Portokalos family.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.137
I sent you the invitation.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.098
I'm the mayor of your father's village.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.058
Welcome to the reunion!

12:05.851 --> 12:09.062
We are related
through your <i>pappou's pappou,</i>

12:09.062 --> 12:10.355
who was a twin

12:10.355 --> 12:14.193
and married to my great-great <i>yiayia's</i>
sister's sister-in-law.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.069
- Cousin!
- Hey!

12:16.069 --> 12:18.155
- Oh! Cousin!

12:18.697 --> 12:19.907
Oh, my God.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.366
I'm Victory.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.453
Aunt Voula. I will be your favorite.

12:24.453 --> 12:27.873
Frappé, iced coffee, Greek style.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.917
Thank you. Do you have decaf?

12:30.459 --> 12:32.419
<i>Sopa.</i> You're in Greece now.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.754
I'll try it.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.215
Ah, what's happening?

12:36.215 --> 12:38.175
- What's <i>"sopa"</i> mean?
- It kind of means "shush."

12:38.175 --> 12:40.135
It means "shut up."

12:41.345 --> 12:43.305
Okay. This way to the car.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.389
- Come.
- Shotgun.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.474
No!

12:45.474 --> 12:46.808
- Come on, I got it.
- This way.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.310
Come on, everyone.

12:48.894 --> 12:49.895
Whoo!

12:55.817 --> 12:57.569
Are you okay about Aristotle on the trip?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.071
Let me live my life. Okay?

12:59.071 --> 13:00.405
- Cousin.
- Yeah?

13:00.405 --> 13:02.074
- You drive.
- No!

13:02.074 --> 13:03.492
I've never been to Greece.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.202
I'll give you directions.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.870
Looking good, <i>mori.</i>

13:07.621 --> 13:08.830
Victory?

13:10.707 --> 13:13.043
How many people are you expecting
at the reunion?

13:13.043 --> 13:14.711
Come on, come on. We need music!

13:16.004 --> 13:18.215
I love this song. Number one. The best.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.633
Everybody, sing!

13:32.938 --> 13:35.107
Toula, go straight.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.236
The city of Athens.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.863
Hey, do we have time to stop there?

13:40.863 --> 13:41.947
No.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.162
Toula, turn left.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.791
The ancient Parthenon.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.169
Are we going there today?
No.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.378
Ah.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.259
The Olympic stadium.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.635
Could we...
No.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.349
From here,
a short boat ride to the island.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.643
Can we see the island from here?

14:11.643 --> 14:12.769
No.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.819
Don't slow down.
We're going to miss the boat.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.404
Is that a beach?

14:22.404 --> 14:24.281
Oh, can we go swimming?

14:24.281 --> 14:25.365
Yes.

14:28.202 --> 14:29.953
Time for a swim!

14:29.953 --> 14:32.164
- We have to get to the village.
<i>- Sopa!</i>

14:37.794 --> 14:40.380
- Go fast, or we will miss the boat.
- Okay.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.344
Whoo! Whoo!

14:46.720 --> 14:47.721
Whoo!

15:18.335 --> 15:19.837
Whoo!

15:30.430 --> 15:31.431
Come on, Toula.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.894
<i>Opa! Opa! Opa!</i>

16:16.768 --> 16:18.854
It's like we've gone back in time.

16:35.621 --> 16:38.665
My daughter is divorced two times.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.751
My son is gay.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.085
Okay.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.797
So I understand alternative lifestyles.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.091
I like your fashion look.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.470
Do you like to wear
boy clothes or girl clothes?

16:51.470 --> 16:53.639
- Both and neither.
- Ah.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.266
- How about you?
- Depends on the day.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.809
I like you.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.437
Everybody does.

17:01.855 --> 17:06.193
All my life, I had a bone in my hip

17:06.193 --> 17:10.656
that stuck out
like a toothpick in an olive.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.699
Touch it.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.204
Olive groves.

17:26.672 --> 17:29.800
People from many countries
working the harvest.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.678
And some people from our village
work there, too,

17:32.678 --> 17:35.055
because our olive groves don't have water.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.016
But I have a plan to bring them back.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.060
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.437
Because I love our village.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.316
I love Greece!

17:46.316 --> 17:48.569
Number one. The best.

17:48.569 --> 17:50.445
Whoo!

18:26.899 --> 18:27.900
That's it.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.860
That's my dad's village.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.249
Everybody out!

18:53.800 --> 18:55.969
We need a picture for Mom.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.304
Oh, here we are.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.223
- Okay, ready?
- Thea Frieda, I have your neck.

18:59.223 --> 19:00.724
- Pull. Pull. Pull.
- Okay.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.059
- High. High.
- Neck?

19:02.059 --> 19:03.936
-  There we are.
I've got this.

19:03.936 --> 19:05.938
- Relax your lips.
- Yeah.

19:05.938 --> 19:08.106
"I'm so mad at the camera."

19:08.106 --> 19:10.484
Now... blow it away.

19:11.902 --> 19:14.279
- Blow it away.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.075
Supermodels. Is fantastic.

19:18.075 --> 19:20.035
Number one. The best.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.246
- I'm gonna send this to Mom.
- I go now to rest.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.915
Okay... Victory?

19:26.083 --> 19:27.751
Wh... Where's Victory?

19:28.752 --> 19:31.797
Every village has its hidden passages.

19:31.797 --> 19:36.844
Like a maze, because of centuries
of invading countries and wars.

19:37.886 --> 19:38.929
Follow me.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.563
Right up here.

19:48.814 --> 19:49.815
This way.

19:51.859 --> 19:52.860
Come, come.

19:53.402 --> 19:54.862
No, this way.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.199
Okay.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.499
Where is everyone?

20:07.499 --> 20:09.001
Maybe they're at work.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.338
No, it's something bad.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.840
- Jesus!

20:32.774 --> 20:33.817
Yes.

20:41.909 --> 20:43.076
What'd she say?

20:43.076 --> 20:46.079
"I was just a chin hair away
from being your mother."

21:04.890 --> 21:07.226
I had no idea
<i>Pappou's</i> village was so nice.

21:07.226 --> 21:08.435
Hey, don't talk about it.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.770
It's bad luck.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.813
No restaurants or hotels open, guys.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.650
Let's go to where
your mother and me grew up.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.568
Mykonos knows how to party.

21:16.568 --> 21:18.111
Can we go to Mykonos?

21:18.111 --> 21:20.364
We're here for the reunion.

21:20.364 --> 21:22.449
Then we're going drinking?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.535
How old do you think this tree is?

21:24.535 --> 21:25.786
Let me see.

21:27.287 --> 21:31.041
Uh, 98 years and seven months.

21:31.875 --> 21:36.380
Chest height, 2.11,
multiplied by diameter.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.799
- Dendrochronology.
- Greek word.

21:39.341 --> 21:42.469
Our dad talked about this square.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.305
Our dad played here
with his three best friends,

21:45.305 --> 21:47.349
Thanasis, Dimos, and George.

22:09.955 --> 22:14.501
Hmm. Your grandfather talked about
a freshwater spring

22:14.501 --> 22:17.045
flowing down from the mountain.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.964
Women would fill jugs.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.799
We only saw that one woman, though.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.426
- Who?
She was angry.

22:22.426 --> 22:23.844
Who was angry?
-  Oi!

22:23.844 --> 22:26.430
Jesus. Where does she come from?

22:29.600 --> 22:31.226
Hello, Constantinos.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.353
It's good to see you again.

22:33.854 --> 22:35.939
Um, hello, but no.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.525
No, I'm... I'm Nikos Portokalos.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.235
I'm Constantine's son.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.279
We lost our dad late last year.

22:42.905 --> 22:45.365
Do you know which house was his?

22:45.365 --> 22:47.075
Gone. Fire.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.537
Come.

22:51.205 --> 22:53.916
Follow me down this dark alley.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.251
Oh, cool.

22:56.251 --> 22:58.337
So no one will find our bodies.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.016
I am Alexandra.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.726
I am making soup.

23:12.726 --> 23:15.062
Yeah, this is where it ends.

23:15.062 --> 23:16.355
Get the eggs.

23:17.481 --> 23:19.316
Chairs. Bowls.

23:20.692 --> 23:23.987
Oh, nobody feeds these ones?

23:24.613 --> 23:26.365
Eat. Eat.

23:26.365 --> 23:28.534
- That's why she has no breasts...
- Oh. Oh.

23:28.534 --> 23:30.202
...and he has no <i>kolo.</i>

23:30.202 --> 23:31.745
Okay. No, no. Good.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.413
Thank you. That's good. That's good.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.583
- Why? Okay, thank you.
- Ah!

23:36.583 --> 23:38.919
What does your husband hold on to?

23:38.919 --> 23:41.088
Everybody needs a love handle.

23:41.088 --> 23:42.589
I smell food.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.466
Don't talk about it. It's bad luck.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.592
Oh, my...

23:48.303 --> 23:49.805
Welcome.

23:49.805 --> 23:51.557
My helper, Qamar.

23:52.558 --> 23:53.851
- She lives with me.
- Hi.

23:53.851 --> 23:56.061
- She's like a daughter to me.
Aw.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.063
- An orphan from Syria.
- Oh.

23:58.063 --> 24:00.190
Say hello. We are not xenophobic.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.776
- Greek word.
- Yes, we know. We are Greeks.

24:03.402 --> 24:05.487
Hi.
- Hi.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.822
Oh. Little friend.

24:06.822 --> 24:08.365
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.535
You're studying... Ah, philosophy.

24:11.535 --> 24:12.786
Invented by the Greeks.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.454
Again, we know.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.664
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah. You?

24:15.664 --> 24:16.957
I study chemistry.

24:16.957 --> 24:19.209
- Get the bread.
Nice.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.878
I have something for you.

24:20.878 --> 24:22.796
- Hope you like it.
- Hot! Ah!

24:22.796 --> 24:25.007
You never reached into a fire?

24:25.549 --> 24:26.675
Ah, that's so nice.

24:26.675 --> 24:28.468
- Yes, in my culture, we give gifts.
- Oh.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.556
How did you get this?

24:32.556 --> 24:34.183
Uh, the mayor sent it.

24:34.183 --> 24:35.726
- Who?
- Victory.

24:35.726 --> 24:38.812
Oh. Only one person voted... Victory...

24:38.812 --> 24:40.898
So Victory's the mayor.

24:40.898 --> 24:42.649
A win is a win.

24:45.235 --> 24:46.320
What did you do?

24:46.320 --> 24:49.198
It is my plan for the village regrowth.

24:49.823 --> 24:52.159
All the people who moved away years ago?

24:52.910 --> 24:55.579
I invited them for a reunion.

24:56.288 --> 24:58.749
They will remember how beautiful it is,

24:58.749 --> 25:00.584
and they will move back,

25:00.584 --> 25:03.337
and the village will go great again.

25:03.337 --> 25:05.714
See? I'm a good mayor.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.090
How many people live here?

25:07.674 --> 25:08.884
- Lots.
- Six.

25:08.884 --> 25:10.344
Six is a lot.

25:10.344 --> 25:12.137
Who came for the reunion?

25:12.137 --> 25:13.597
- You.
And?

25:13.597 --> 25:16.058
- You.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

25:16.058 --> 25:17.935
We came all this way to give
something very important

25:17.935 --> 25:19.478
to my father-in-law's friends.

25:19.478 --> 25:20.979
Now you're saying nobody's here?

25:20.979 --> 25:22.231
Whoa, Dad.

25:22.231 --> 25:26.068
Not catastrophe. Is fantastic.
Don't worry.

25:26.068 --> 25:28.570
You know, it's... It's been a long day.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.905
I'll... I'll call us a cab.

25:29.905 --> 25:32.032
I'm also the town taxi driver.

25:32.032 --> 25:33.116
But no.

25:33.116 --> 25:36.537
You will all sleep
in the biggest house in the village.

25:36.537 --> 25:38.288
No one lives there now.

25:38.288 --> 25:39.915
No, we're gonna go to that hotel.

25:39.915 --> 25:42.167
If you want to insult us.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.672
We would love to stay.

26:08.902 --> 26:10.153
- No Wi-Fi.
- Yeah.

26:21.498 --> 26:22.624
The stairs are out.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.169
That's... There's...
There's no other bedrooms.

26:25.169 --> 26:27.796
Hey, one room all together
is how our dad grew up.

26:27.796 --> 26:29.173
Yeah.

26:29.173 --> 26:31.258
Hey, guys, this is gonna be fun.

26:31.842 --> 26:33.886
Family sleepover!

26:33.886 --> 26:36.263
I can do facials with Greek yogurt.

26:36.263 --> 26:37.347
Enemas, too.

26:37.347 --> 26:38.432
Pass.

26:39.057 --> 26:40.767
Flavored yogurt or plain, Thea?

26:41.310 --> 26:42.853
Always the fruit.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.906
"Give her space" doesn't mean try harder.

26:53.906 --> 26:57.784
No, I'm not a creep,
and, uh, she's not into nerds.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.786
Nerds win, Aristotle.

26:59.786 --> 27:00.913
Were you a nerd?

27:01.955 --> 27:03.040
No.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.084
Women, they just want us to hear 'em,

27:06.084 --> 27:08.795
and we should listen
'cause they got a lot to teach us.

27:10.631 --> 27:13.342
But then you get married, and they try
and strangle you in your sleep.

27:17.012 --> 27:19.264
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

27:19.264 --> 27:20.849
- We did that!
- We lit a fire!

27:20.849 --> 27:22.851
- We just did that!

27:22.851 --> 27:24.478
Oh, it looks great in here.

27:24.478 --> 27:26.897
- Oh, okay.
- There we are.

27:26.897 --> 27:28.357
Okay, there it is.

27:28.357 --> 27:30.776
Hey, Thea, we lit a fire.

27:30.776 --> 27:32.194
Oh! Bravo.
We did it. We...

27:32.194 --> 27:35.072
Bravo, Niko, Aristotle.
Very manly.

27:35.072 --> 27:37.241
But don't brag. It's bad luck.

27:37.241 --> 27:40.536
Ugh! "Don't cross your legs in church.
It's bad luck."

27:40.536 --> 27:43.163
"Don't give an empty wallet as a gift.
It's bad luck."

27:43.163 --> 27:45.499
Don't make fun of your aunts.
It's bad luck.

28:01.348 --> 28:03.684
Ian. Ian.

28:03.684 --> 28:04.810
What? What? What?

28:07.437 --> 28:08.564
There was a man.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.524
Uh...

28:10.524 --> 28:12.651
He was right there, a man.

28:12.651 --> 28:15.112
- What'd he look like?
- Ah, I didn't really see him,

28:15.112 --> 28:17.197
but, like, handsome, piercing eyes.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.741
- Handsome?
- Yeah. Right there.

28:20.742 --> 28:21.827
Oh. Oh!

28:27.708 --> 28:29.376
- Hey.
- Mmm.

28:30.836 --> 28:33.338
Have sex on Easter like everyone else.

28:34.464 --> 28:36.675
This is nice. Anybody cold?

28:36.675 --> 28:39.136
No, so don't yell at anybody.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.306
That was epic.

28:42.306 --> 28:43.557
I yelled before.

28:43.557 --> 28:44.892
<i>Sopa.</i>

28:46.977 --> 28:50.564
Well, it's not what we expected,
but we made it to Greece, yeah?

28:50.564 --> 28:52.900
- Yeah. This is good.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.985
Well, let's hit the hay, I guess.

28:54.985 --> 28:56.403
I am not tired.

28:56.403 --> 28:58.822
Oh, you drank, like, ten frappé coffees.

28:58.822 --> 29:01.491
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Yeah.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.746
- All right.
- Okay.

29:05.746 --> 29:07.247
Let's go, too.

29:43.992 --> 29:45.953
We are going
to the best dance club.

29:45.953 --> 29:47.663
Is it close?
No.

29:57.756 --> 29:58.966
We need drinks.

29:58.966 --> 30:00.259
Welcome.

30:00.259 --> 30:02.052
- Here.
- Thanks.

30:02.678 --> 30:03.846
Christos!

30:03.846 --> 30:05.889
Qamar's boyfriend!

30:05.889 --> 30:08.600
But his father wants him to marry a Greek.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.186
So it's a secret.

30:11.186 --> 30:12.646
Secrets are a waste of time.

30:14.481 --> 30:17.776
In this life, be open about what you want.

30:17.776 --> 30:20.112
- I want to go dance.
Mmm!

30:20.112 --> 30:21.238
Whoo!

30:30.247 --> 30:31.248
So...

30:42.301 --> 30:43.927
Oh, no, no.

30:43.927 --> 30:45.554
No, no, no, no. Uh...

30:45.554 --> 30:47.723
Well, I... I don't really know him.

30:47.723 --> 30:50.267
- You will end up together.
- What?

30:50.267 --> 30:52.519
Enjoy the dance to that moment.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.479
And, you, dance with me.

30:54.479 --> 30:55.898
- Okay.

31:15.375 --> 31:17.461
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

31:17.461 --> 31:18.879
Hey.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.882
So, uh...

31:23.217 --> 31:24.301
This got weird.

31:24.301 --> 31:27.471
- I'm sorry, I...
- No, no. I'm sorry, okay?

31:27.471 --> 31:30.098
- This year was rough for me.
- You don't have to explain anything.

31:31.183 --> 31:32.184
Ever.

31:32.184 --> 31:34.102
Let's make the best
of the rest of the vacation.

31:34.102 --> 31:37.564
In a remote Greek village
inhabited by ghosts and anger.

31:38.148 --> 31:39.274
Let's do it.

31:42.444 --> 31:44.196
Come on. Come on.

32:37.291 --> 32:39.001
What is it? What's happening?

32:42.087 --> 32:43.422
- Shoo!

32:44.590 --> 32:46.967
I thought my husband
came back from the dead.

33:02.357 --> 33:03.692
Hey!

33:03.692 --> 33:08.030
Someone's loud truck
woke me up last night!

33:08.030 --> 33:09.781
Hey!

33:13.202 --> 33:14.203
Is she gone?

33:14.203 --> 33:15.787
Great news.

33:15.787 --> 33:19.333
The grandfather of my friend
received the reunion invitation.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.753
Oh. He's dead.

33:25.839 --> 33:28.467
My dad's best friends.
Thanasis, Dimos, and George.

33:28.467 --> 33:30.427
- I know them.
- Oh! Do they still live here?

33:30.427 --> 33:32.179
- No.
- How do we find them?

33:32.179 --> 33:34.097
They will come for the reunion.

33:34.097 --> 33:36.391
- Did they tell you they're coming?
- No.

34:05.921 --> 34:08.005
Aristotle! Groceries.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.226
How did it go?

34:20.893 --> 34:22.603
Ugh.

34:27.484 --> 34:30.152
Oh, look.

34:34.116 --> 34:35.701
Where did she come from?

34:45.585 --> 34:46.920
Handmade purses and shoes!

34:46.920 --> 34:48.880
Oh! The big city.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.007
I'm going to shop till you drop.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.303
Fresh watermelon. Look.

34:57.681 --> 34:59.141
There we are.

34:59.141 --> 35:00.225
Come this way.

35:01.143 --> 35:02.186
Over here.

35:04.855 --> 35:07.232
Hopefully, someone will know
my dad's friends.

35:09.985 --> 35:12.279
So, you are giving me
the best cheese

35:12.279 --> 35:14.573
and the fattest beans, yes?

35:14.573 --> 35:16.200
Of course.

35:16.783 --> 35:18.410
Oh, thank you.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.996
We buy from them, they give to us.

35:20.996 --> 35:22.206
Thank you.

35:22.206 --> 35:23.373
Cheers.

35:23.373 --> 35:24.666
Ah.
Hmm.

35:26.418 --> 35:27.419
Mmm, good.

35:28.504 --> 35:31.256
Do you know where these men moved to?

35:31.882 --> 35:34.009
- From the village of Vrisi.
- No.

35:34.009 --> 35:35.427
- Drink.
- Okay.

35:36.011 --> 35:39.056
Thea, I didn't sleep last night,
and I can't really day-drink like this.

35:39.056 --> 35:41.767
Don't worry, don't worry.
A lady is never drunk.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.352
-  Cheers.
- Okay.

35:48.524 --> 35:50.984
Do you know these men,
and where they moved to?

35:50.984 --> 35:53.195
- Drink.

35:57.115 --> 35:58.617
Cheers.
Cheers. Cheers.

36:03.914 --> 36:05.040
Drink.

36:05.624 --> 36:06.625
Cheers.

36:15.384 --> 36:17.261
- You want some wet cheese?
Sure.

36:18.011 --> 36:19.555
Hey, is there a shower?

36:19.555 --> 36:20.639
There.

36:21.139 --> 36:22.182
It's not warm.

36:23.058 --> 36:24.434
Eh, not a problem.

36:37.281 --> 36:40.075
Hey, Victory.
Did you hear from my dad's friends?

36:40.075 --> 36:43.203
As the mayor, I promise
you did not travel here for no reason.

36:43.203 --> 36:44.288
They will come soon.

36:44.288 --> 36:46.582
Where's the oldest tree
in this entire area?

36:46.582 --> 36:47.916
Is it the one in the olive grove?

36:47.916 --> 36:49.793
- Ask Alexandra.
- No.

36:56.508 --> 36:58.218
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, it is.

36:58.218 --> 37:00.387
And by the way, there's a shower
right there if you need one.

37:00.387 --> 37:02.097
- Ha!
- Thanks, man.

37:06.727 --> 37:09.563
Nick!

37:20.532 --> 37:21.533
Oh.

37:40.677 --> 37:41.678
Oh.

38:17.464 --> 38:19.299
Pick the one we have for dinner.

38:20.300 --> 38:21.385
Oh, thank you.

38:21.385 --> 38:23.053
Uh, I'm a vegetarian.

38:24.471 --> 38:25.472
No.

38:28.141 --> 38:30.185
Which way's the path to the sea?

38:38.694 --> 38:39.862
Oh, thank you.

39:31.622 --> 39:32.623
Hey, Thea.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.001
Is this a memorial?

39:36.710 --> 39:38.754
Yeah. So many wars.

39:39.922 --> 39:41.924
My dad never talked about that stuff.

39:43.509 --> 39:45.385
Getting through those years
made him strong.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.346
Afraid of nothing.

39:48.055 --> 39:49.515
Yeah.

39:50.474 --> 39:51.600
That's Greek men.

39:54.478 --> 39:56.063
- Hide.
- Oh.

39:59.399 --> 40:00.442
Scooch over.

40:06.532 --> 40:08.700
I will ask around. Here.

40:24.299 --> 40:25.467
Drink!

40:25.467 --> 40:28.262
Don't worry. A lady is never drunk.

40:28.846 --> 40:29.888
Oh...

40:30.722 --> 40:31.765
Oh...

40:32.599 --> 40:36.270
I have never seen my mom drink
anything more than communion wine.

40:36.270 --> 40:38.105
- They were thirsty.

40:38.105 --> 40:40.524
Whee!

40:41.191 --> 40:42.442
I ate a bug!

40:43.110 --> 40:44.152
Come!

40:46.238 --> 40:48.240
Oh. Ah, Paris! That's good.

40:48.824 --> 40:50.200
There they are!

40:50.200 --> 40:51.535
Victory!

40:51.535 --> 40:52.828
Hand these out.

40:52.828 --> 40:54.371
Oh, thank you. Okay.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.123
- Alexandra, that's for you.
- Here you go.

40:57.833 --> 40:59.168
Ah. Hi.

40:59.168 --> 41:01.837
- Hey.
- Hi! Oh, I saw that guy again.

41:01.837 --> 41:02.921
What guy? You...

41:02.921 --> 41:04.214
- You been drinking?
- Yeah.

41:04.214 --> 41:06.675
The handsome guy who was
outside the window last night.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.135
I saw him today.

41:09.094 --> 41:11.096
It's kind of weird. Hey, listen.

41:11.096 --> 41:13.348
- Want to go make out in the chicken coop?
- What?

41:16.935 --> 41:19.062
I need sugar for my bougatsa.

41:21.398 --> 41:22.524
- Hey, Toula.
- Uh?

41:22.524 --> 41:23.984
Is this family dinner?

41:25.527 --> 41:26.570
It is.

41:26.570 --> 41:28.322
Nice.

41:28.864 --> 41:31.116
- You find Dad's friends?
- Uh...

41:31.700 --> 41:34.119
- Soon.
- Okay. Listen to me, Toula.

41:34.119 --> 41:36.455
- You're gonna find them. Okay?
- Yeah.

41:36.455 --> 41:37.956
- You're gonna find them.
- Okay.

41:39.291 --> 41:40.834
You're a good cook.

41:40.834 --> 41:43.295
- I'm a good cook, too.

41:43.295 --> 41:45.422
- Maybe better.
- Oh.

41:45.422 --> 41:46.632
Right here.

41:59.228 --> 42:00.229
Go.

42:00.979 --> 42:01.980
Go.

42:04.024 --> 42:06.401
We should invite the six villagers.

42:06.401 --> 42:08.237
I'll ask them.

42:08.237 --> 42:11.532
I'm cooking! Wear your eating pants!

42:13.325 --> 42:15.827
Yep.

42:21.750 --> 42:23.544
I'm so mad at the camera.

42:23.544 --> 42:25.337
Now blow it away.

42:28.215 --> 42:29.550
Whoo!

42:29.550 --> 42:31.343
Supermodels. Fantastic.

42:31.343 --> 42:33.345
Number one. The best.

42:36.098 --> 42:38.851
Why haven't you made your move?

42:38.851 --> 42:40.853
We decided to be friends.

42:40.853 --> 42:42.604
"Decided to be friends"

42:42.604 --> 42:45.941
is for when you find out
that you're dating a cousin.

42:52.948 --> 42:54.157
Company's coming.

42:54.825 --> 42:56.201
You're drunk.

42:56.201 --> 42:57.578
- You are.
- Yeah.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.168
That's him.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.338
That's the man from last night.

43:09.631 --> 43:11.175
- Hello.
- Alexandra's son.

43:11.175 --> 43:13.135
Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

43:14.136 --> 43:16.513
Ah, Alexandra's son.

43:16.513 --> 43:17.806
Mystery solved.

43:17.806 --> 43:19.892
Why is he looking at you?

43:19.892 --> 43:21.602
What... Why are you smiling?

43:21.602 --> 43:22.686
I'm not.

43:23.228 --> 43:24.646
Yes, you are.

43:24.646 --> 43:27.191
"He's so handsome."
That's the way you described him.

43:27.191 --> 43:29.151
-  I did?
- Yeah.

43:29.151 --> 43:32.905
So I can't look at a handsome man
who's clearly attracted to me?

43:34.531 --> 43:35.574
I'm your brother.

43:37.451 --> 43:39.077
<i>Sopa.</i>

43:40.287 --> 43:41.288
Brother?

43:41.288 --> 43:42.706
Yes.

43:42.706 --> 43:44.833
- So not attracted to Toula?
- Nick.

43:44.833 --> 43:46.084
Got it. Wait.

43:46.627 --> 43:47.920
What's happening?

43:47.920 --> 43:49.463
I was with your father

43:49.463 --> 43:52.132
before he left the village
and met your mother.

43:53.175 --> 43:56.011
Your father never knew this is our son,

43:56.011 --> 43:57.095
Peter.

43:59.890 --> 44:02.768
And this is my son, Christos.

44:02.768 --> 44:03.852
Hello.

44:12.402 --> 44:13.695
All right.

44:13.695 --> 44:14.947
<i>Opa.</i>

44:14.947 --> 44:16.740
Crazy!
- Wow!

44:19.493 --> 44:20.494
Oh, my God.

44:21.912 --> 44:23.914
Yes, family!

44:23.914 --> 44:26.083
Oh, you carried this burden alone.

44:26.083 --> 44:28.001
It was my secret to keep.

44:28.001 --> 44:30.045
Secrets are a waste of time.

44:30.045 --> 44:32.297
-  Cheers!

44:33.549 --> 44:35.133
A toast to living your truth.

44:35.133 --> 44:38.095
Yeah, and, hey, well,
Qamar and Christos are dating.

44:38.095 --> 44:39.346
- Oh.
-  Yeah.

44:41.431 --> 44:42.891
What?

44:43.392 --> 44:45.602
We never wanted you to find out this way.

44:46.144 --> 44:48.021
I don't want you to think badly of me.

44:51.692 --> 44:52.693
But we're in love.

44:54.820 --> 44:56.321
Who wants bougatsa?

44:59.950 --> 45:01.618
- I'll take a bite of that.
- Maybe a bite, yeah.

45:01.618 --> 45:02.703
- Yes, right.
- Yeah.

45:06.707 --> 45:09.251
Yes. Yeah, sorry.

45:09.251 --> 45:11.920
Uh, but, do you know where he lives now?

45:11.920 --> 45:15.257
No, no, no...
Not the father, the grandfather.

45:15.257 --> 45:17.634
Yes. Tell him about the reunion.

45:20.762 --> 45:21.930
"Welcome to the reunion."

45:22.389 --> 45:24.141
It's at the end of the week.
Is anyone gonna show?

45:24.141 --> 45:26.602
Everything will be wonderful.

45:26.602 --> 45:27.686
Like last night.

45:27.686 --> 45:29.104
Great party.

45:29.771 --> 45:30.856
It was a catastrophe

45:30.856 --> 45:33.525
and kind of your fault
for proposing a toast.

45:34.526 --> 45:36.361
That is what makes me fun.

45:41.491 --> 45:43.285
Oh, how's your head?

45:44.494 --> 45:46.371
Like it's on too tight.

45:49.041 --> 45:50.250
What's he trimming?

45:50.918 --> 45:51.919
What do you think?

45:52.461 --> 45:53.837
Upstairs or downstairs?

45:54.838 --> 45:55.839
Oh, man.

45:56.298 --> 45:59.426
So, Toula, Peter's pretty mad
about Qamar not being Greek.

45:59.426 --> 46:01.345
Hey. I'm a non-Greek in this family.

46:01.345 --> 46:02.679
Turned out okay.

46:02.679 --> 46:03.764
Did it?

46:05.140 --> 46:06.642
Another brother.

46:06.642 --> 46:07.976
My mind is blown.

46:08.519 --> 46:11.647
Yeah. My mind is blowing in the wind, too.

46:16.902 --> 46:20.489
I am surprised, but I am not surprised,

46:21.031 --> 46:23.158
because I'm never surprised.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.370
You lost me.

46:27.579 --> 46:30.457
So, Toula, do we tell Mom about Peter?

46:31.208 --> 46:32.209
No.

46:32.835 --> 46:35.963
Are you gonna tell your sister
about her late husband's son?

46:35.963 --> 46:38.257
Frieda, you know me.

46:38.257 --> 46:40.926
I'm sorry. I know you're not a gossip.

46:40.926 --> 46:43.345
I am not a gossip. I'm a tattletale.

46:44.012 --> 46:45.389
I already called her.

46:45.973 --> 46:47.683
- Hey, Toula, your phone.

46:48.892 --> 46:50.102
Hey, it's Athena.

46:51.019 --> 46:52.354
- Hey.
<i>Hi.</i>

46:52.354 --> 46:54.439
We have a brother?

46:54.439 --> 46:55.649
Your mom is right here.

46:55.649 --> 46:57.651
<i>We told her about Peter.</i>

46:58.902 --> 47:00.320
Hello.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.572
Hi, Mom.

47:02.322 --> 47:03.323
So...

47:04.366 --> 47:07.536
Your father has a son
that he didn't know about?

47:09.079 --> 47:10.205
Well...

47:10.914 --> 47:13.166
it was a long time ago.

47:13.166 --> 47:16.837
We always have room
for more love in this family.

47:17.671 --> 47:20.716
And you tell Peter
I can't wait to meet him.

47:20.716 --> 47:23.385
Oh. And say hello to his mother.

47:23.927 --> 47:26.722
I'll bet her name is Alexandra.

47:27.264 --> 47:28.265
It is.

47:28.265 --> 47:31.643
Well, your father
talked in his sleep.

47:33.979 --> 47:36.064
What were we talking about?

47:36.648 --> 47:39.151
Hello? No, it's me, Nick, your son.

47:39.151 --> 47:40.569
I... I know. I know.

47:40.569 --> 47:42.112
I know.

47:42.863 --> 47:45.157
We love you, Mom. It's okay.

47:45.908 --> 47:46.909
We love you, Ma.

47:48.243 --> 47:49.453
Talk to you later.

47:49.453 --> 47:50.537
Bye.

47:55.167 --> 47:56.627
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

48:14.144 --> 48:15.562
I used your recipe.

48:16.813 --> 48:18.857
Not enough mizithra.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.486
Oh, wow, look at this.

48:22.486 --> 48:23.570
Great.

48:23.570 --> 48:25.781
- Hot cheese! Hot cheese.
- Oh!

48:28.575 --> 48:29.618
Number one.

48:30.702 --> 48:31.745
The best.

48:37.251 --> 48:39.086
So, we take them from here.

48:39.086 --> 48:41.547
We separate the leaves from olives.

48:55.394 --> 48:57.145
What happened to the fountain
in our village?

48:57.145 --> 48:58.230
Why is it dry?

48:58.230 --> 48:59.773
The rockslide cut off the spring.

48:59.773 --> 49:01.900
Don't start with me. I'll get to it.

49:01.900 --> 49:03.277
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

49:03.277 --> 49:05.362
- Yep. No, no!

49:05.362 --> 49:06.655
Hold... Hold up!

49:08.240 --> 49:11.410
My son,
we lost his mother, but he stayed strong.

49:11.410 --> 49:12.786
He's a smart kid.

49:13.453 --> 49:16.081
He earned a degree
in sustainable agriculture.

49:16.748 --> 49:19.543
This country needs his brain.

49:19.543 --> 49:22.379
Instead, he's wasting
his time dating a <i>xeni.</i>

49:23.088 --> 49:24.089
A <i>xeni!</i>

49:24.089 --> 49:26.633
Eat something, Peter. You'll feel better.

49:31.013 --> 49:33.640
Hey, do you know where
the oldest tree in the area is?

49:34.349 --> 49:35.350
My dad...

49:37.519 --> 49:38.770
Our dad,

49:38.770 --> 49:40.772
when he used to talk to me about it,

49:40.772 --> 49:43.275
he told me he used to
sit underneath it and dream.

49:43.775 --> 49:45.027
Do you know where it is?

49:45.027 --> 49:46.111
No.

49:46.778 --> 49:48.655
- Ask my mother.
- No.

49:52.242 --> 49:54.203
Hey. Is your head still caving in?

49:54.786 --> 49:55.913
Yeah.

49:57.456 --> 49:59.791
Come on, take a walk with me.
I'm gonna go hang with a monk.

49:59.791 --> 50:01.168
- A monk?
- Yeah.

50:02.169 --> 50:03.170
I can't.

50:03.962 --> 50:06.924
I really need
to find my dad's friends.

50:18.393 --> 50:19.770
Hi.
- Hey.

50:21.230 --> 50:22.231
Hi.

50:28.153 --> 50:29.530
Sorry about last night.

50:30.197 --> 50:32.533
I forgot there was alcohol in alcohol.

50:33.742 --> 50:37.287
For the record,
I was not attracted to you.

50:37.287 --> 50:39.873
- Hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.
- Hmm?

50:41.166 --> 50:44.962
So, uh... this was our dad's.

50:48.966 --> 50:52.427
It's a journal he kept from the time
he went to America.

50:54.972 --> 50:57.516
Do you think that any of these invitations

50:57.516 --> 51:00.143
reached the older people
that live in other cities?

51:01.019 --> 51:02.187
No. Stop trying.

51:02.771 --> 51:05.107
Well, I'm gonna keep looking everywhere.

51:05.107 --> 51:06.191
Thanks, Toula.

51:06.942 --> 51:07.943
You got it.

51:08.569 --> 51:09.695
- Bye.
- Bye.

51:09.695 --> 51:11.613
Oh. Right there. See that?

51:12.197 --> 51:13.365
You have many children.

51:13.365 --> 51:15.534
Yeah. But none of them
listen to me, you know?

51:15.534 --> 51:17.452
But, hey, I go with it. I learn.

51:17.452 --> 51:18.620
You must know,

51:18.620 --> 51:21.373
a tree that bends is stronger
than the tree that breaks.

51:23.083 --> 51:24.585
I think the saying is,

51:24.585 --> 51:27.379
"The tree that won't bend
breaks in the wind."

51:29.214 --> 51:31.425
No, I think it's,

51:31.425 --> 51:33.802
"The windless tree bends from breaking."

51:33.802 --> 51:35.637
What the hell is a windless tree?

51:35.637 --> 51:37.055
What do you mean, Peter? Come on.

51:38.682 --> 51:40.726
A windless tree doesn't move,

51:40.726 --> 51:42.144
like a stubborn Greek father.

51:42.144 --> 51:43.812
That's a bad metaphor.

51:43.812 --> 51:45.355
Now, let's talk about your son.

51:54.698 --> 51:57.326
Ah, I'm sorry I don't speak more Greek.

51:57.868 --> 51:59.578
But I know <i>"efharisto."</i>

51:59.578 --> 52:01.246
Oh. Very good.

52:02.831 --> 52:05.167
We were given all these things,

52:05.167 --> 52:07.085
and I'd like to give them to you,

52:07.085 --> 52:08.295
if you don't mind.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.631
Of course I don't mind.

52:11.590 --> 52:14.635
"Regift" is a Greek word.

52:14.635 --> 52:16.428
- There you go.

52:22.809 --> 52:26.355
If Victory's plan works,
and people move back to the village,

52:26.355 --> 52:29.441
Qamar and I will run this
as an organic farm,

52:29.441 --> 52:30.943
exporting products to the world.

52:31.568 --> 52:33.070
That is our life plan.

52:33.779 --> 52:34.780
Whoa.

52:35.739 --> 52:36.740
What's yours?

52:37.741 --> 52:38.784
Uh...

52:39.326 --> 52:42.329
I'm hoping my roommate gets swapped out.

52:43.205 --> 52:46.500
He... steals my waters and floss.

52:47.292 --> 52:49.044
So, you know, he's kind of a drag.

52:49.044 --> 52:50.254
Uh, Paris?

52:50.254 --> 52:52.256
You know, jump in.

52:52.965 --> 52:53.966
Uh...

52:55.133 --> 52:56.134
Um...

52:57.678 --> 52:58.762
You...

53:00.514 --> 53:03.350
I just remembered,
I don't want to be here right now.

54:43.325 --> 54:44.535
I suck.

54:47.496 --> 54:52.209
I cannot fulfill the one thing
my dad ever asked me to do.

54:52.751 --> 54:55.170
Actually, he asked you to do a lot, Toula.

54:59.007 --> 55:00.843
- Right?
- Mmm-hmm.

55:00.843 --> 55:03.512
-  Like, every day.
- Yeah.

55:03.512 --> 55:04.930
Oh, my God, so much.

55:07.266 --> 55:08.392
But this is big.

55:08.392 --> 55:10.352
You know, I promised him.

55:15.023 --> 55:16.567
It's been a hard year, huh.

55:16.567 --> 55:18.277
- Mmm-hmm.
- Both our dads.

55:18.902 --> 55:20.445
Now I have another brother.

55:24.533 --> 55:25.659
My mom.

55:27.369 --> 55:28.370
That's hard.

55:28.829 --> 55:30.622
I just wonder how she feels, you know?

55:30.622 --> 55:33.166
How she... If she's afraid.

55:34.293 --> 55:36.461
- And something's up with Paris.
- Oh, no, no.

55:36.461 --> 55:37.671
- You...
- No. No.

55:37.671 --> 55:39.047
- You two...
- Hey.

55:39.548 --> 55:40.716
What's this say?

55:42.551 --> 55:45.012
What, that? That's the word "Syros."

55:45.012 --> 55:46.430
It's an island here.

55:46.430 --> 55:49.099
- Where'd you get this?
- From my friend, the monk.

55:49.099 --> 55:52.227
I think it's a list of all
the older people that moved away.

55:55.063 --> 55:56.481
And where they moved to.

55:57.065 --> 55:58.066
What?

55:58.567 --> 55:59.568
It's all here.

56:00.277 --> 56:03.614
Thanasis and Dimos and George.

56:06.033 --> 56:08.535
I love you so much.

56:08.535 --> 56:10.454
- I have to call Nikki.

56:11.997 --> 56:13.457
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey, hey.

56:13.457 --> 56:16.043
I heard you have a hot older brother.

56:16.043 --> 56:18.629
<i>- How's the reunion?</i>
- There isn't one.

56:18.629 --> 56:20.923
<i>All of Gus' friends moved far away.</i>

56:20.923 --> 56:23.550
Thanasis Papagianopoulos went to Syros.

56:23.550 --> 56:25.802
<i>Dimos Ginakes went to Paros.</i>

56:25.802 --> 56:27.971
<i>George Diacos went to Rhodes.</i>

56:27.971 --> 56:30.891
So, Nikki, you were on Syros
last summer, right?

56:30.891 --> 56:32.768
Yeah, yeah. Uh... I know Syros and Paros.

56:32.768 --> 56:34.895
Yeah, and actually,
Patrick and me, we did five islands.

56:34.895 --> 56:36.313
Okay.

56:36.313 --> 56:38.398
Could you both make some calls

56:38.398 --> 56:41.944
and see if anyone can get
the message to these three men

56:41.944 --> 56:43.111
about the reunion?

56:43.111 --> 56:45.322
Yeah, sure. I know
eight or nine people right off the bat.

56:45.322 --> 56:47.491
- No problem.
- Yeah, Angelo and I are on it.

56:48.158 --> 56:49.159
Okay...

56:49.159 --> 56:51.078
- Okay, bye.

56:53.956 --> 56:55.541
- You did that!
- Yeah.

56:56.792 --> 56:58.794
<i>Flight 235
departing for Athens.</i>

57:10.639 --> 57:13.350
So, do you think anyone else
is coming to this reunion?

57:14.977 --> 57:17.396
Thea Voula, can we change our tickets
to stay longer?

57:17.396 --> 57:19.106
No, we flew on the points.

57:19.106 --> 57:20.941
Oh. Hi.

57:23.652 --> 57:25.988
Dad! Oh! Can you please...

57:27.698 --> 57:29.575
Can you just give me some privacy?

57:32.035 --> 57:33.287
Mmm-mmm.

57:33.829 --> 57:34.830
Come here.

57:40.294 --> 57:41.420
Look at that view.

57:41.420 --> 57:43.213
Oh!

57:43.213 --> 57:44.590
This is beautiful.

57:46.800 --> 57:49.011
My dad grew up with all this

57:50.095 --> 57:51.138
and no food.

57:52.347 --> 57:54.433
But he built a great life. He worked hard.

57:54.433 --> 57:55.517
Really hard.

57:57.019 --> 57:58.312
Let's not do that.

57:59.688 --> 58:01.481
We never came to Greece.

58:02.232 --> 58:04.151
We never took a real vacation.

58:04.818 --> 58:06.778
We should be having fun.

58:06.778 --> 58:08.113
We should be on a vacation.

58:08.113 --> 58:10.741
- Come on.
- Let's have some fun while we can.

58:11.909 --> 58:13.577
I'm just gonna try Nikki one more time.

58:13.577 --> 58:14.786
<i>- Hey.</i>
Hi!

58:14.786 --> 58:16.955
Did you find my dad's friends?

58:16.955 --> 58:18.790
<i>Don't worry. Oh.</i>

58:20.042 --> 58:21.043
<i>Got to go.</i>

58:22.211 --> 58:23.212
Oh.

58:23.212 --> 58:24.880
<i>Welcome to Athens, Greece.</i>

58:24.880 --> 58:25.964
Hi.

58:26.632 --> 58:28.509
"Soov" or "comfort table"?

58:35.432 --> 58:36.433
Comfort table.

58:52.407 --> 58:54.284
<i>Departing
for the island of Syros.</i>

58:59.748 --> 59:02.334
<i>Now arriving
on the island of Syros.</i>

59:02.334 --> 59:04.294
<i>Exit from the rear of the boat.</i>

59:05.045 --> 59:06.755
Hey. We partied last summer.

59:06.755 --> 59:07.840
Nikki!

59:07.840 --> 59:10.759
Can you help us find a man named
Thanasis Papagianopoulos?

59:10.759 --> 59:13.720
He's about 80 years old,
and he comes from the town of Vrisi.

59:15.389 --> 59:16.849
We'll find him.
Yeah.

59:24.857 --> 59:26.900
- Uh, from Angelo.

59:28.026 --> 59:30.195
"Don't worry. We got you."

59:30.195 --> 59:31.989
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

59:31.989 --> 59:33.866
You're gonna get the journal
to your dad's friends.

59:33.866 --> 59:35.909
- Yes.
- Something's going on with Paris,

59:35.909 --> 59:37.828
- but we're gonna let her work it out.
- No.

59:41.665 --> 59:42.749
Thanasis?

59:44.042 --> 59:45.335
We'll find him.

59:52.551 --> 59:53.552
Hey.

59:53.552 --> 59:55.512
You ready for the reunion on Saturday?

59:56.180 --> 59:58.223
Victory... no one's coming.

59:58.223 --> 01:00:01.143
Yes, they are,
and we are going to have a party.

01:00:01.727 --> 01:00:04.229
Good, good.
Because Qamar and I are getting married.

01:00:04.229 --> 01:00:05.314
Say what now?

01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:16.700
That's fantastic!

01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:20.579
So the wedding is on Saturday.

01:00:21.663 --> 01:00:22.706
No reunion?

01:00:23.582 --> 01:00:24.583
I don't know.

01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:27.419
- Now I have to tell my mother.
- No.

01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:30.839
A Greek mother goes through life
with two emotions,

01:00:30.839 --> 01:00:32.591
"I love you so much,"

01:00:32.591 --> 01:00:35.469
and "Why don't you love me
as much as I love you?"

01:00:36.053 --> 01:00:37.179
- Hey!

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:38.847
- Where does she come from?
- Oh, come on.

01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:40.807
You're letting them get married!

01:00:40.807 --> 01:00:42.267
She's a refugee!

01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:46.063
With respect, <i>Yiayia,</i> she's an immigrant.

01:00:46.063 --> 01:00:48.232
Like the Ukrainians
in the town you give food to.

01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:50.400
Like <i>Pappou</i> to America.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.319
You kept a secret from your family.

01:00:55.197 --> 01:00:56.990
- What's funny?
- Okay.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:58.492
You're terrifying.

01:00:58.492 --> 01:01:00.244
Uh, it's just that...

01:01:00.953 --> 01:01:04.039
Ian and I once kept a secret
from our parents, too.

01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:05.707
As did you from yours.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:09.211
I quit my job as a busboy

01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:10.921
and pretended to go to work for two weeks.

01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:13.465
I used to smoke.

01:01:14.216 --> 01:01:15.926
I failed my entire first year of college.

01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:19.012
- You win.
- You what?

01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:23.308
Hang on. You failed?

01:01:23.308 --> 01:01:25.811
We trusted you to go to NYU,
and you blew it?

01:01:25.811 --> 01:01:26.895
What happened?

01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:30.232
Sheltered life, got her freedom,
partied her face off.

01:01:30.232 --> 01:01:31.567
Come on, it happens.

01:01:31.567 --> 01:01:33.277
You two used to make out in the car

01:01:33.277 --> 01:01:35.571
like badgers tearing apart a bag of Oreos.

01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:36.655
Thea Voula.

01:01:36.655 --> 01:01:40.993
Taki and I used to make out so much,
my face is still chapped.

01:01:40.993 --> 01:01:42.744
- Thea Voula.
- Here, feel my chin.

01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:44.496
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01:44.496 --> 01:01:46.164
Now I got to call the dean.

01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:48.792
No, I will get myself through this.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.043
Like I did.

01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:56.842
You don't need my permission
to get married.

01:01:56.842 --> 01:01:58.260
We are getting married.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.678
I give you my permission.

01:02:03.932 --> 01:02:05.684
Oh, we are family now.

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:07.811
You look Greek.

01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:09.646
- And you look Syrian.
- Ooh!

01:02:09.646 --> 01:02:11.440
Everybody, sing!

01:02:14.359 --> 01:02:15.903
We have to let her handle it.

01:02:17.946 --> 01:02:19.198
That's what I told you.

01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:21.116
Really?

01:02:21.116 --> 01:02:22.492
Oh, man.

01:02:22.492 --> 01:02:23.577
What did you do?

01:02:24.203 --> 01:02:25.621
I don't want details.

01:02:26.038 --> 01:02:27.372
Just one detail.

01:02:27.372 --> 01:02:28.498
We have work to do.

01:02:28.498 --> 01:02:32.127
Oh, Christos, the theas, you come with me.

01:02:32.127 --> 01:02:34.505
And, Toula... Toula, you...

01:02:34.505 --> 01:02:35.964
Take a vacation.

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:38.467
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Let's do it!

01:02:38.467 --> 01:02:41.303
Yes, yes.
You go away and do it, you little badgers.

01:02:41.303 --> 01:02:42.763
Okay, we'll be back to help later.

01:02:42.763 --> 01:02:44.973
I want to know everything.

01:02:48.268 --> 01:02:49.269
Beautiful.

01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:22.678
Ah!

01:03:40.571 --> 01:03:42.447
Thanasis Papagianopoulos?

01:03:42.447 --> 01:03:45.117
Do you know where Dimos and George are?

01:04:12.102 --> 01:04:14.104
Why did you feel the need
to go to all these parties?

01:04:14.688 --> 01:04:17.774
Because I had never been
to a party before.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.120
What's that, Nick?

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.205
Nothing.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.918
This is the oldest tree?

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.921
Yeah.

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:48.759
Okay, Toula just got back.
Don't say anything or she'll kill me.

01:06:48.759 --> 01:06:51.970
I probably broke some international law
by transferring this urn, but...

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:54.848
Can you keep a secret?

01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:58.018
No.

01:07:02.773 --> 01:07:03.774
Peter.

01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:06.443
Peter!

01:07:07.027 --> 01:07:09.530
Toula, I heard you're back.

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:10.656
Look.

01:07:12.074 --> 01:07:13.325
I thought you should know.

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.084
- Hey!
Ha!

01:07:22.084 --> 01:07:23.502
What are you doing?

01:07:23.502 --> 01:07:25.420
I can't tell you, 'cause you'll say no!

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:38.267
Thea Frieda.

01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:42.312
How did he get here?

01:07:42.312 --> 01:07:43.438
Nick.

01:07:44.398 --> 01:07:46.483
Do you know what my brother is up to?

01:07:47.067 --> 01:07:48.402
Hmm.

01:07:48.402 --> 01:07:50.320
I'm not asking you to gossip.

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:53.866
Okay, good. It's not gossip, it's a fact.

01:07:53.866 --> 01:07:55.534
When we lost your father,

01:07:55.534 --> 01:07:58.203
your brother asked me
the process to bury him in Greece.

01:07:59.454 --> 01:08:00.622
Okay.

01:08:37.868 --> 01:08:40.245
I will put this <i>koufeta</i> under your pillow

01:08:40.245 --> 01:08:42.122
so you dream about who you will marry.

01:08:42.122 --> 01:08:44.707
No more voodoo, okay?

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:47.252
Also, there's other things
for Greek kids to do

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:50.087
rather than just get married
and make Greek babies, you know.

01:08:50.087 --> 01:08:52.466
- Some do.
- And I respect their choice.

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:54.343
What are you going to do about college?

01:08:54.843 --> 01:08:56.178
Can we please not discuss it?

01:08:56.178 --> 01:08:58.013
No. That's not what we do.

01:08:58.013 --> 01:09:00.265
We yell and scream.

01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:02.225
We find a solution together

01:09:02.684 --> 01:09:05.229
using threats and guilt.

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:08.273
I don't think we yelled enough. Hmm-hmm.

01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:12.194
Trust me, you can't make me feel
any worse than I already feel.

01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:14.947
That's not a meal.

01:09:17.073 --> 01:09:18.075
Come.

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:20.493
I baked a goat.

01:09:37.678 --> 01:09:39.595
Everybody, listen to Thea Frieda.

01:09:40.514 --> 01:09:42.140
Come on, we got to move these rocks.

01:09:45.727 --> 01:09:48.647
All right, this is gonna work.
We're ready to go.

01:09:48.647 --> 01:09:50.816
- Okay, pull.

01:09:50.816 --> 01:09:52.609
Where's the urn?
Hidden!

01:10:00.075 --> 01:10:02.578
- Pull!
Keep pulling! Keep pulling!

01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:18.343
Run!

01:10:19.219 --> 01:10:21.555
Grab it! Grab it! Look at this!

01:10:23.432 --> 01:10:26.059
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:36.403
We are finally ready for the wedding.

01:10:37.154 --> 01:10:39.198
Wait. Shouldn't we take this down?

01:10:41.533 --> 01:10:42.618
<i>Sopa.</i>

01:10:55.756 --> 01:10:57.299
This is the Syrian dabke.

01:10:57.299 --> 01:10:58.592
- Everybody!

01:10:58.592 --> 01:11:01.136
Whoo! Everybody, listen!

01:11:01.136 --> 01:11:03.180
Follow me to find groom this way,

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:06.767
and follow Aristotle and Paris
to find bride that way.

01:11:06.767 --> 01:11:08.060
Let's do it!

01:11:10.312 --> 01:11:11.939
Let's do it! Hey!

01:12:19.464 --> 01:12:20.465
Whoo-hoo!

01:12:35.606 --> 01:12:36.773
Looking good, <i>mori.</i>

01:13:47.845 --> 01:13:49.847
We came for the reunion!

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.141
Who's that?

01:13:56.937 --> 01:13:58.772
We are here for the reunion!

01:14:02.192 --> 01:14:03.277
I did it.

01:14:09.074 --> 01:14:11.034
Cousin!
- Cousin!

01:14:14.288 --> 01:14:16.081
You asked me to find the men.
I found everyone.

01:14:16.081 --> 01:14:17.541
What did you do?

01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:19.334
What are you doing here?

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:21.920
Thanasis, Dimos, and George?

01:14:51.575 --> 01:14:53.285
Everybody!

01:14:53.994 --> 01:14:55.370
This way!

01:15:30.072 --> 01:15:32.824
We are now going to dance
a traditional Greek dance.

01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:35.452
All men, come dance the Hasapia!

01:15:35.452 --> 01:15:36.537
And all the women,

01:15:36.537 --> 01:15:39.665
please come join us
or the traditional Syrian Samah!

01:16:20.038 --> 01:16:22.332
You dreamt about Aristotle last night.

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:24.710
How did you know?

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:26.795
I put <i>koufeta</i> under your pillow.

01:16:27.963 --> 01:16:29.339
Greek voodoo.

01:16:29.339 --> 01:16:30.424
Bam!

01:16:44.521 --> 01:16:46.815
Why don't you go dance?
I'll hold your bag for you.

01:16:46.815 --> 01:16:48.192
Mmm-mmm.

01:16:49.943 --> 01:16:51.111
How much do you know?

01:16:51.612 --> 01:16:52.696
All of it.

01:16:55.282 --> 01:16:59.578
You planned to use
this ash-neutralizing kit

01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:02.206
to bury Dad in Greece.

01:17:02.206 --> 01:17:04.708
No, no, no, beside Dad's favorite tree

01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:06.585
so he could grow into an olive tree.

01:17:06.585 --> 01:17:08.337
I mean, it's got seeds in it,

01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:11.173
and I was planning on taking
half the urn back to Mom.

01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:14.468
It's not your decision to make.
It's Mom's.

01:17:14.468 --> 01:17:16.470
Mom can't make that type
of decision right now,

01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:17.888
and you know that, Toula.

01:17:17.888 --> 01:17:21.141
Okay, see, the problem is
there's no head of the family anymore.

01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:22.226
Don't say that.

01:17:22.226 --> 01:17:24.978
No, no, I'm saying it
'cause it's supposed to be you.

01:17:24.978 --> 01:17:26.313
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:27.981
But Athena's the oldest.

01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:29.733
Athena's got, like, six kids!

01:17:29.733 --> 01:17:31.485
And we decided you had the time.

01:17:31.485 --> 01:17:32.694
Oh. Okay.

01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:34.029
Well, it's supposed to be Peter, then.

01:17:34.029 --> 01:17:35.656
Peter. Peter's too busy, too, Toula.

01:17:35.656 --> 01:17:36.823
No.

01:17:36.823 --> 01:17:37.991
You know, I'm calling it.

01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:39.243
I'm calling it.

01:17:39.243 --> 01:17:40.744
- You're calling it?
- I am.

01:17:40.744 --> 01:17:42.329
You got us back to Greece.

01:17:42.329 --> 01:17:44.831
You got Dad's book back to his friends.

01:17:44.831 --> 01:17:48.418
And, well,
you're the head of the family now.

01:17:48.418 --> 01:17:49.545
Hey, Nick...

01:17:54.842 --> 01:17:57.177
You got Dad back to Greece.

01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:08.730
- I did.
- So you're the head of the family.

01:18:11.525 --> 01:18:13.068
- Can we share it?
- Yeah, okay, we'll share it.

01:18:13.068 --> 01:18:14.444
- Can you hold family dinners?
- Yes.

01:18:14.444 --> 01:18:15.863
- Okay.
- I'm not doing them alone!

01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:17.155
- You have to help me cook.
- I'll help.

01:18:17.155 --> 01:18:18.866
- I will.
- Then fine.

01:18:22.119 --> 01:18:23.120
You know...

01:18:23.954 --> 01:18:28.000
sometimes Mom remembers,
even if it's just for a few moments.

01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:32.129
And that's enough, huh?

01:18:35.215 --> 01:18:37.426
Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:40.554
Hey, Nick?

01:18:40.554 --> 01:18:43.974
This kit, it's for cremated pets.

01:18:45.559 --> 01:18:47.686
Oh. Yeah, I see the dog now.

01:18:47.686 --> 01:18:49.229
Yeah, I thought it was a bush.

01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:50.981
- It's a dog.
- Looks like a bush.

01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:52.065
Yeah.

01:18:59.156 --> 01:19:00.908
You know what? You're right.

01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:05.120
I am?

01:20:21.947 --> 01:20:23.198
Do you want to dance?

01:20:24.825 --> 01:20:28.245
Aristotle, you...
You don't want to date me, okay?

01:20:28.245 --> 01:20:30.080
I'm a mess.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.458
Now you know why
I didn't answer you all year.

01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:37.045
Because I was partying...
Me, the perfect, nice Greek girl.

01:20:37.045 --> 01:20:38.130
Okay? I blew it.

01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:39.882
I want to do well in college.

01:20:39.882 --> 01:20:41.133
That is my life plan.

01:20:41.717 --> 01:20:43.594
But the philosopher Aristotle once said,

01:20:43.594 --> 01:20:46.180
"Educating the mind
without educating the heart

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.015
"is no education at all."

01:20:50.934 --> 01:20:52.686
Okay, you are so Greek.

01:20:52.686 --> 01:20:53.770
Come on.

01:20:54.396 --> 01:20:56.106
I... I have to fix my life.

01:20:56.773 --> 01:20:57.774
Let's get some air.

01:21:04.406 --> 01:21:06.366
<i>Opa!</i>

01:21:07.743 --> 01:21:08.744
Hey, hey.

01:21:09.286 --> 01:21:10.287
It's... It's okay.

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:14.249
Here's my proposal.

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:18.962
Can we take this slow?

01:21:22.841 --> 01:21:23.842
Yeah.

01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:25.719
You can text me.

01:21:26.303 --> 01:21:27.513
Okay.

01:21:27.513 --> 01:21:28.722
I just might.

01:21:48.951 --> 01:21:51.703
No babies until you graduate from college

01:21:51.703 --> 01:21:53.747
and you buy your parents a house.

01:21:59.503 --> 01:22:02.840
Greek aunties. Better than dating apps.

01:22:05.592 --> 01:22:06.885
They won't stay.

01:22:07.427 --> 01:22:08.554
I know.

01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:11.098
I was thinking...

01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:14.351
The migrants in the area,

01:22:15.102 --> 01:22:17.855
they could live in these empty houses.

01:22:20.399 --> 01:22:23.026
Maybe you are a good mayor after all.

01:22:23.026 --> 01:22:24.111
Yes!

01:22:25.237 --> 01:22:26.613
I said "maybe."

01:22:34.872 --> 01:22:36.665
I'm a good mayor, yes?

01:22:36.665 --> 01:22:39.001
- Number one. The best.
- Hey, keep it.

01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:40.919
Thank you for everything.

01:22:43.964 --> 01:22:45.007
Cousin.

01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:54.057
- Hi!

01:23:36.141 --> 01:23:39.686
<i>I think my dad knew
how much we needed to go on this trip,</i>

01:23:39.686 --> 01:23:41.522
<i>to bring us together</i>

01:23:41.522 --> 01:23:44.900
<i>and help each other
with the changes that life brings.</i>

01:23:48.779 --> 01:23:52.824
<i>We went to a reunion to bring
my dad's story to his friends.</i>

01:23:54.117 --> 01:23:57.788
<i>We didn't know a part of his life
would be coming home with us.</i>

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:07.297
Hey, Ian.

01:24:07.297 --> 01:24:09.299
Yeah, so where you at? I can't see you.

01:24:09.299 --> 01:24:10.968
<i>I'm right behind you. Turn around.</i>

01:24:13.554 --> 01:24:15.347
Well, behind me where?
I still can't see you.

01:24:15.347 --> 01:24:17.182
<i>Maybe that's not you. Wave your arms.</i>

01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:19.601
- I'm waving.
<i>- Jump up and down.</i>

01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:22.646
<i>Oh, it's so crowded.</i>

01:24:22.646 --> 01:24:23.856
Make a donkey sound.

01:24:23.856 --> 01:24:25.524
Hee-haw!

01:24:25.524 --> 01:24:28.443
- Louder.
- Hee... haw.

01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:31.947
You're outside, aren't you?

01:24:32.614 --> 01:24:33.615
Told you I'm fun.

01:24:35.242 --> 01:24:36.994
<i>I guess we will never know</i>

01:24:36.994 --> 01:24:39.162
<i>who is now the head of the family,</i>

01:24:39.162 --> 01:24:41.957
<i>so we'll argue about it... loudly.</i>

01:24:41.957 --> 01:24:44.751
<i>And the fact is, it doesn't
really matter who's in charge,</i>

01:24:44.751 --> 01:24:46.795
<i>as long as we're together.</i>

01:24:46.795 --> 01:24:49.548
Okay, listen, wait. I say we go get Ma,

01:24:49.548 --> 01:24:51.133
and then maybe we can have
a family dinner.

01:24:51.133 --> 01:24:52.885
- Toula's cooking.
- Hey.

01:24:52.885 --> 01:24:54.052
Say it.

01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:56.388
Wear your eating pants!

01:24:56.388 --> 01:24:57.890
- Yeah!

01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:59.266
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:24:59.266 --> 01:25:01.560
<i>Stuck together by our own sweat.</i>

01:25:08.901 --> 01:25:12.362
<i>Oli mazi, oli mazi</i>

01:25:12.362 --> 01:25:17.451
<i>We are all together</i>

01:25:17.451 --> 01:25:19.620
<i>It doesn't matter where we are</i>

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.080
<i>We're always close, we're never far</i>

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.291
<i>From each other</i>

01:25:24.291 --> 01:25:26.752
<i>Mmm, mmm</i>

01:25:26.752 --> 01:25:28.879
<i>'Cause I'm with you everywhere</i>

01:25:28.879 --> 01:25:31.215
<i>Good to know we're always there</i>

01:25:31.215 --> 01:25:33.383
<i>For one another</i>

01:25:33.383 --> 01:25:35.719
<i>Mmm, mmm</i>

01:25:36.637 --> 01:25:40.390
<i>Love will always always, always find a way</i>

01:25:41.225 --> 01:25:44.853
<i>And all I, all I, all I wanna say</i>

01:25:44.853 --> 01:25:46.855
<i>Oli mazi</i>

01:25:46.855 --> 01:25:51.401
<i>We, we are all together in this life</i>

01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:54.238
<i>Zoe</i>

01:25:54.238 --> 01:25:56.073
<i>Oli mazi</i>

01:25:56.073 --> 01:26:00.494
<i>Free, free to be whoever we wanna be</i>

01:26:00.494 --> 01:26:03.163
<i>We're one family</i>

01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:04.873
<i>Oli mazi</i>

01:26:04.873 --> 01:26:07.918
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:26:07.918 --> 01:26:09.419

01:26:09.419 --> 01:26:11.713
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.092
<i>It doesn't matter what you do</i>

01:26:15.092 --> 01:26:17.427
<i>You're here for me I'm here for you</i>

01:26:17.427 --> 01:26:19.847
<i>And that's forever. That's forever</i>

01:26:19.847 --> 01:26:21.473
<i>Mmm, mmm</i>

01:26:22.266 --> 01:26:24.393
<i>'Cause I know you got my back</i>

01:26:24.393 --> 01:26:26.603
<i>And I got yours, we both know that</i>

01:26:26.603 --> 01:26:29.064
<i>There's nothing better
There's nothing better</i>

01:26:29.064 --> 01:26:30.899
<i>Mmm, mmm</i>

01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:36.488
<i>Love will always
always, always save the day</i>

01:26:36.488 --> 01:26:40.367
<i>And all I, all I, all I wanna say</i>

01:26:40.367 --> 01:26:42.244
<i>Oli mazi</i>

<i>We are all together. We are all together</i>

01:27:26.496 --> 01:27:29.750
<i>Everybody say, "Oli mazi"</i>

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.126
<i>Oli mazi</i>

01:27:31.126 --> 01:27:33.545
