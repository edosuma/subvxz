WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.369
Look, all
I'm saying is

00:02.435 --> 00:04.371
you have
more hair to wash,

00:04.437 --> 00:05.705
you should pay
a bigger share

00:05.772 --> 00:06.740
of the water bill.

00:06.806 --> 00:09.442
Says the girl with the
300-watt makeup mirror.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.643
Is something burning?

00:10.710 --> 00:11.644
Oh! Smoke!

00:11.711 --> 00:13.046
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

00:13.113 --> 00:15.281
Flames.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.183
(<i> coughing</i> )

00:17.250 --> 00:18.585
Great.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.420
Blackened cookies.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.489
Do you think
Annie will believe me

00:22.555 --> 00:24.357
when I tell her they're Cajun?

00:24.424 --> 00:26.659
Why are you
baking cookies for your boss?

00:26.726 --> 00:28.695
Well, I thought
getting her sacks of cash

00:28.762 --> 00:29.529
would be too obvious.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.231
This week is
my performance review

00:31.297 --> 00:33.133
and every little bit
of sucking up helps.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.434
Unfortunately, sacks of cash

00:34.501 --> 00:36.403
is exactly what
the electric company wants.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.204
This is what
we each owe for utilities.

00:38.271 --> 00:41.641
But if I pay that, I won't have
enough for my car payment

00:41.708 --> 00:42.809
<i>or</i> my nails.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.512
Not even one coat.

00:45.578 --> 00:46.513
How pathetic am I?

00:46.579 --> 00:47.680
I'm going to have to put

00:47.747 --> 00:49.282
half of this on my credit cards.

00:49.349 --> 00:52.719
Plastic! Yes, I'm saved.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.188
No. All mine are maxed out.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.790
So? There are, like,
five applications

00:56.856 --> 00:58.525
for new ones in today's mail.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.560
Of course. That is good.

01:00.627 --> 01:01.728
This is America.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.664
Exactly. Life, liberty...
and the pursuit

01:04.731 --> 01:07.834
of the perfect
little black dress.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.505
Ooh.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.574
I think I put
one too many eggs in.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.446
Whoa. Well, guess that answers

01:19.512 --> 01:21.648
the whole
"chicken or the egg" question.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.791
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:31.858 --> 01:38.531
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:38.598 --> 01:41.701
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:41.768 --> 01:45.738
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:47.740 --> 01:51.344
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:51.411 --> 01:55.882
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

02:02.355 --> 02:03.723
Someone looks pretty
spiffy today

02:03.790 --> 02:05.859
and I don't
just mean me.

02:05.925 --> 02:07.193
I'm meeting Aaron
after work.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.294
It's our first
official date

02:08.361 --> 02:09.362
and I want
to look perfect.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.864
Oh? Is that a hole?

02:10.930 --> 02:12.332
Oh, no. Just lace.

02:12.398 --> 02:14.200
For the record, the
way to a man's heart

02:14.267 --> 02:15.168
is not through
his stomach.

02:15.235 --> 02:16.169
Here, I'll prove it.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.070
Hey, hands off.

02:17.136 --> 02:18.838
Those are a shameless
bribe for Annie.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.707
Along with the mocha-almond
coffee I made.

02:20.773 --> 02:21.608
Hello.

02:21.674 --> 02:22.609
Who made this coffee?

02:22.675 --> 02:25.378
I did.
It's disgusting.

02:25.445 --> 02:26.846
You know I don't like
anything sweet.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.850
Except for an occasional
chocolate chip cookie.

02:30.917 --> 02:31.851
All right, Spellman,

02:31.918 --> 02:33.353
we've got work
to do, and by "we"

02:33.419 --> 02:35.188
I mean you. I need
these pages proofed.

02:35.255 --> 02:37.924
Hey, this is
your article.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.225
Wow, you must
have a lot

02:39.292 --> 02:40.493
of faith in me.
I'm flattered.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.895
Don't be.
You're all I've got.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.863
The temp they sent over
is dyslexic.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.798
Me and my red pen will
get all over this.

02:45.865 --> 02:46.866
I mean, not that
I'm expecting

02:46.933 --> 02:47.934
a lot of mistakes.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.236
I'm expecting a lot of,
you know, check plusses

02:50.303 --> 02:51.337
and "very goods"
and "good jobs"

02:51.404 --> 02:52.338
and "very funnys."

02:52.405 --> 02:53.640
The article's
about starvation

02:53.706 --> 02:54.707
in sub-Saharan Africa.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.410
And in your capable hands,
I'm sure it's hilarious.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.679
I'll get started.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.384
What? That
sentence is perfect.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.486
Except that it ends
in a preposition.

03:06.553 --> 03:07.487
Which... Shakespeare

03:07.554 --> 03:08.788
did all the time,

03:08.855 --> 03:11.624
so I'll just turn
this question mark

03:11.691 --> 03:12.859
into a happy face.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.260
You do realize

03:14.327 --> 03:15.728
that for your
review tomorrow,

03:15.795 --> 03:17.196
Jonathan has
finally consented

03:17.263 --> 03:18.731
to letting me
decide your fate.

03:18.798 --> 03:21.534
And it's a good thing we get
along so well or I'd be worried.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.469
This has to be perfect.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.506
Annie, apropos of nothing,
care for a cookie?

03:26.573 --> 03:27.707
Oh, Leonard,

03:27.774 --> 03:29.576
that's so sweet
of you. You know,

03:29.642 --> 03:31.711
a little sucking up
wouldn't kill you, Spellman.

03:35.682 --> 03:36.416
Okay, are you sure

03:36.482 --> 03:38.418
this is how you spell
"Madagascar"?

03:38.484 --> 03:40.386
I'm sure.
Merriam-Webster
is sure.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.255
The ambassador
to Madagascar is sure

03:42.322 --> 03:43.256
Okay, I'm sorry.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.257
I just can't afford

03:44.324 --> 03:45.358
to make even one mistake.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.359
Am I just paranoid

03:46.426 --> 03:47.493
or is Annie out to get me?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.895
Oh, she's definitely
out to get you.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.964
The rest of us talk
about it all the time.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.633
Oh, well that explains
the pointing and whispers.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.368
Sure. Believe
whatever you want.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.803
Okay, well,
after tomorrow

03:56.869 --> 03:58.838
Annie is going to be
my biggest fan.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.239
Good. Does that mean we're done

04:00.306 --> 04:01.608
and we can finally
get something to eat?

04:01.674 --> 04:03.443
Eat. Dinner. Aaron. Oh, no.

04:03.509 --> 04:06.012
Oh, so much
for tonight being perfect.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.914
Oh, late for your
first date, huh?

04:07.981 --> 04:08.915
Could that be

04:08.982 --> 04:10.483
your subconscious calling out

04:10.550 --> 04:12.652
for a steaming hot bowl
of Leonard Stew?

04:12.719 --> 04:14.887
No, but I think I did
just hear it scream.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.289
Oh, hey. Aaron.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.924
Yeah. I'm so sorry.
I am on my way.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.759
Well, actually,
I'm in the parking lot.

04:19.826 --> 04:20.760
Late and lying.

04:20.827 --> 04:21.961
This relationship is doomed.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.930
No, that's just the valet.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.865
Thank you for
your input, sir.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.700
Now, please,
just park the car.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.302
Okay, I'll be right there.

04:29.369 --> 04:30.403
Bye, Leonard.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.537
"Bye, Leonard."

04:31.604 --> 04:33.272
"Thanks
for staying late."

04:33.339 --> 04:34.574
"Thanks for helping me out."

04:34.641 --> 04:36.342
Hey, thanks for staying late
and helping me out.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.877
Hey, anytime.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.946
She<i> so</i> wants me.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.283
Hi.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.685
Oh. Hi.

04:45.752 --> 04:46.986
I didn't see
you come in.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.321
Oh, then
you missed

04:48.388 --> 04:50.356
my pirouette
by the dessert cart?

04:50.990 --> 04:51.958
I'm sorry I'm late.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.793
Oh, don't worry about it.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.495
You look really beautiful.

04:55.561 --> 04:56.696
Thanks. You, too.

04:56.763 --> 04:58.998
Well-- or whatever
the male equivalent is.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.567
So, um... you must be starving.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.404
No, I ordered an artichoke
for us to share

05:04.470 --> 05:05.905
and... it was delicious.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.508
Not to worry--
I've ordered us another one.

05:08.574 --> 05:09.575
Oh. Perfect.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.943
I love artichokes, you know.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.311
Totally underrated vegetable.

05:12.378 --> 05:13.713
I mean, grows its own wrapper,

05:13.780 --> 05:15.715
leaves conveniently shaped
for dipping...

05:16.416 --> 05:18.651
And really hard
to hold onto. I'm sorry.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.019
Oh, don't worry about it.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.055
My fault for not
putting down a napkin

05:22.121 --> 05:23.456
nor wearing rubber pants.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.891
I think I'm just really nervous.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.993
You know, I wanted
our first date to be perfect

05:27.060 --> 05:29.629
and here I am, you know, late
and throwing food all over...

05:29.696 --> 05:31.764
the restaurant.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.899
(<i> blowing</i> )

05:32.965 --> 05:33.900
It's okay.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.034
Five-second rule.

05:35.101 --> 05:38.004
You know, um, it would be okay
if you said something.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.505
In fact, it would be helpful.

05:39.572 --> 05:40.506
Are you kidding?

05:40.573 --> 05:41.774
I'm enjoying the performance.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.676
Well, then, you should
stay for the late show.

05:43.743 --> 05:44.977
Not that I'm
implying anything.

05:45.044 --> 05:46.879
Not that I'm not implying
anything. I just...

05:46.946 --> 05:47.947
Please say something.

05:50.416 --> 05:51.350
So...

05:51.417 --> 05:53.820
Seen any good movies?

05:56.155 --> 05:57.123
Great. Another
credit card

05:57.190 --> 05:58.224
activated and
ready to go.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.027
Plus, it came with 10,000
miles on Icelandic Air.

06:01.094 --> 06:01.994
This is so easy.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.996
You should have seen
what I had to fill out

06:04.063 --> 06:05.498
to get a Blockbuster membership.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.966
Why it is easier
to get a credit card

06:07.033 --> 06:08.735
than rent<i> A Night</i>
<i>at the Roxbury?</i>

06:08.801 --> 06:09.769
Oh, Sabrina's home.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.070
We should probably clear out,

06:11.137 --> 06:11.904
give them some privacy.

06:11.971 --> 06:12.739
You're right.

06:12.805 --> 06:14.974
We don't want to be
nosy roommates.

06:18.778 --> 06:21.714
How sweet, he's going
in for the kiss.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.916
No, Sabrina, tilt
to the left.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.718
His left, his left.

06:25.785 --> 06:26.919
Ooh.
Ooh.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.422
That's gotta hurt.

06:32.892 --> 06:33.926
Sorry again.

06:33.993 --> 06:35.561
Are you sure you
don't want to come in?

06:35.628 --> 06:36.562
No, I think
the cold air

06:36.629 --> 06:37.964
well help stop
the bleeding. Night!

06:40.833 --> 06:41.567
Hey, Sabrina.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.035
That was officially
the worst date

06:43.102 --> 06:43.903
of my entire life.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.938
There is no way
he's ever going to want

06:46.005 --> 06:47.039
to go out
with me again.

06:47.106 --> 06:49.408
Then it's good he's the
one with the bloody nose.

06:49.475 --> 06:50.977
And my day
was hardly any better.

06:51.043 --> 06:53.012
Let's just hope
that this is all the storm

06:53.079 --> 06:55.815
before the calm of tomorrow's
glowing performance review.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.416
Before I forget, Leonard called.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.852
He thinks you might have
misspelled "Madagascar."

06:59.919 --> 07:00.853
(<i> groans</i> )

07:00.920 --> 07:02.155
Another mistake brought to you

07:02.221 --> 07:03.923
by the incompetents at Sabrina.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.024
I'm sorry, Sabrina.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.527
Can we at least
buy you something?

07:07.593 --> 07:10.096
Thanks to you, we've got
a $100,000 limit.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.132
No, I don't think anything
could possibly help.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.768
Except maybe one of those
little foot-massager thingies.

07:15.835 --> 07:16.569
That wouldn't hurt.

07:16.636 --> 07:20.740
Maybe, actually,
one for each foot.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.508
Mistakes, goofs,

07:22.575 --> 07:24.010
blunders, faux pas...

07:24.076 --> 07:24.811
Check the appendix.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.712
This book doesn't
have an appendix.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.914
But<i> you</i> do.

07:27.980 --> 07:28.915
The appendix is

07:28.981 --> 07:30.983
nature's biggest mistake.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.518
Well, since the dog.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.453
This is relevant how?

07:34.520 --> 07:35.788
Little-known fact--

07:35.855 --> 07:38.090
If a witch gets rid
of her appendix,

07:38.157 --> 07:39.926
she'll be mistake-free.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.128
Hmm. remove a minor non-vital
organ without anesthesia?

07:42.195 --> 07:44.096
Well, after what I've
been through today,

07:44.163 --> 07:45.064
that doesn't sound so bad.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.033
Mistakes that I make
cause damage and strife.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.901
Help me remove
the cause from my life.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.069
Holy appendectomy!

07:50.136 --> 07:51.003
Please tell me

07:51.070 --> 07:52.538
you're board-certified.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.875
Yes. I'm Ouija Board certified.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.512
Here you go, a
little souvenir.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.947
My appendix
is in there?

08:01.013 --> 08:02.982
What am I supposed
to do with this--

08:03.049 --> 08:05.251
I mean, put it with
my old retainer?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.986
I turned mine
into a hacky sack.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.222
Well, that was useless.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.857
I don't feel any different.

08:10.923 --> 08:11.958
No, not in the slightest.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.893
Well, you seem a
little different.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.595
Oh, pshaw, no different at all.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.897
You know... oh, no time
for dillydallying.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.065
Ticktock. Time for bed.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.701
Perfect.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.003
I couldn't possibly sleep
in an unmade bed.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.543
Okay. Well, see you
in exactly eight hours.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.252
Morning!

08:39.318 --> 08:40.953
Isn't it a perfectly
perfect day?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.956
Yup. Be sure to have
a muffin... or three.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.058
I decided to
have it catered.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.662
Breakfast-- it's everywhere
I want to be.

08:50.630 --> 08:51.964
I'm paying off
my student loans.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.100
Whoever said you can't
put a price on education

08:54.166 --> 08:55.067
didn't go to college.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.136
I can't believe you guys
are being so dense.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.572
You thought it was
a good idea, too.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.540
Not at these interest rates.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.844
Okay, first, transfer
this balance to this card.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.078
Then transfer

09:06.145 --> 09:07.980
that balance
to that card.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.116
Deduct 12%
from the principle...

09:10.182 --> 09:12.952
and you can apply
for two more cards

09:13.019 --> 09:14.787
and a home-equity loan.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.124
Come on-- print.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.625
Okay, I have given you toner.

09:19.692 --> 09:20.860
I have given you paper.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.561
I've given you
everything you asked for.

09:22.628 --> 09:23.829
What more do you
want from me?

09:23.896 --> 09:26.832
You mind if I take
a look at that?

09:26.899 --> 09:28.100
How'd you do that?

09:28.167 --> 09:29.669
Oh, I just
tweaked the tolerance

09:29.735 --> 09:30.937
on the third set
of pass bars

09:31.003 --> 09:32.171
and upped the toner to 33%.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.106
Duh.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.108
Oh, layout for
the skateboarding piece, huh?

09:36.175 --> 09:37.610
Yeah, and I'm on
a little bit

09:37.677 --> 09:39.111
of a deadline,
so if you could...

09:39.178 --> 09:41.080
I know these are action photos,
but something's missing.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.148
Ooh, I think it's the action.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.250
Okay, try leading
with this one. Pow.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.620
Then you follow with these
three... bam, bam, bam.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.889
Yeah, you don't even
need this one.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.391
No, you know what
I don't need?

09:52.458 --> 09:55.194
A perky little know-it-all
telling me how to do my job.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.729
Oh, nice layout, James.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.230
You're welcome.

09:59.231 --> 10:03.703
Aaron, how wonderful
to see you.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.871
Okay, a little Doris Day,
but I could get into it.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.107
I just came by to see if
you're free for lunch.

10:08.174 --> 10:11.644
Your timing is perfect;
we have exactly 60 minutes.

10:11.711 --> 10:12.645
Okay, I read about

10:12.712 --> 10:13.980
this terrific
little Italian...

10:14.046 --> 10:15.181
Uh... Bup, bup, bup.

10:15.247 --> 10:18.017
59 minutes. Less
talk, more walk.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.085
Okay.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.387
(<i> soft music playing</i> )

10:21.454 --> 10:23.189
Well, it sounds
like work's been going

10:23.255 --> 10:24.657
a lot better
for you today.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.960
Hmm? Oh, it's been perfect.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.362
Is something wrong?

10:29.428 --> 10:33.099
No, it's... Well, yes.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.935
It seems that

10:36.002 --> 10:37.203
my side of the
tablecloth

10:37.269 --> 10:39.271
is hanging slightly
lower than your side

10:39.338 --> 10:40.339
and... there's
a stain.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.808
Whoa!

10:42.875 --> 10:43.943
Yeah, I know

10:44.010 --> 10:46.345
and this is a
four-star restaurant.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.781
Anyway, I was about to tell
you about my perfect day.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.349
I'm so looking forward
to this afternoon.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.052
It's my performance review
and I just know that everything

10:53.119 --> 10:54.253
is going to... excuse me.

10:55.187 --> 10:56.355
Hi. Hi there. Hi.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.823
You mind if I...?

10:57.890 --> 10:59.992
Okay, first,
you pluck off the claws

11:00.059 --> 11:01.193
like so...

11:01.260 --> 11:02.862
Then, you pinch
here and here

11:02.928 --> 11:03.996
and voila!

11:04.063 --> 11:05.131
heaven in little
red pants.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.332
Bon appetit.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.771
Wow. Between you and I,
I had no idea

11:11.837 --> 11:13.039
you were such a stickler.

11:13.105 --> 11:16.976
Well, between you and<i> me,</i>
I'm not.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.178
I'm sorry, but the pronoun

11:19.245 --> 11:22.381
in that case is, after all,
the object of a preposition.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.850
What do you say
we get the check?

11:24.917 --> 11:26.118
Well, I don't really
see the need.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.854
I mean, I kept a running total
of everything we had in my head.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.056
Um, you had an ice tea...

11:32.058 --> 11:35.327
Okay, do not say "Ticktock,
ticktock, people" again.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.762
I beg you.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.030
I'm sorry,
but this staff meeting

11:38.097 --> 11:39.298
was supposed to start
two minutes ago.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.167
I mean, my watch is set
to Greenwich Mean Time.

11:41.233 --> 11:44.336
Yeah, well, mine is set to Annie
Mean Time. Where's Leonard?

11:44.403 --> 11:46.705
There you go, proofs
for next week's issue.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.341
Got any changes you, should
have made them this morning.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.277
Oh, shoot,
they spelled my name wrong.

11:51.343 --> 11:53.779
Hey, someone changed
the title of my article.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.114
It was a little wordy.

11:55.181 --> 11:56.115
This has pith.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.117
Somebody
recropped all my photos.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.052
Guilty.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.053
What were you thinking?

12:01.120 --> 12:02.221
I asked you to proof my article.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.489
You changed the entire thing.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.991
But only in the interests
of good journalism.

12:06.058 --> 12:06.992
Now, it's perfect.

12:07.059 --> 12:07.960
Don't you get it?

12:08.027 --> 12:10.796
You changed titles,
you altered the layout.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.031
You rewrote your boss.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.132
What were you thinking?

12:13.199 --> 12:14.967
Well, I was thinking,
in your case

12:15.034 --> 12:17.036
that your third paragraph
should be your lead

12:17.103 --> 12:19.338
and when you read it,
you'll see I was right.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.040
Oh, well, here's a lead for you.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.041
You're fired.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.342
Fired?!

12:23.409 --> 12:26.445
Well, now, that
is not very perfect.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.856
You heard me, Spellman.
You're fired, effective
immediately.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.125
But I don't understand.
Why would you fire me?

12:39.191 --> 12:40.392
I am error-free
I am without flaws.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.927
I don't even
have any cavities.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.295
Look, Annie, I love this job

12:43.362 --> 12:45.397
and I am just trying to
be the best employee

12:45.464 --> 12:48.167
I, or anybody in the history
of employees, could ever...

12:48.234 --> 12:49.301
(<i> cell phone rings</i> )

12:49.368 --> 12:50.469
Sabrina here.

12:50.536 --> 12:51.737
Hey, Sabrina. It's Aaron.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.807
Oh, hi. I don't mean to imply
that your timing isn't perfect,

12:54.874 --> 12:56.342
but I am in the middle
of a slight crisis.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.343
Can I call you back?

12:57.409 --> 12:58.878
You know what? No need.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.546
I was just calling to say

13:00.613 --> 13:03.549
that I think we should
cool things down a bit.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.519
You know, maybe take a break
from each other.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.354
Take a break? From what?
We just started.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.356
Look, if this is about
the artichoke incident,

13:10.422 --> 13:11.190
I swear, I've changed.

13:11.257 --> 13:14.560
Don't worry.
That's perfectly clear.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.929
I'll see you around, Sabrina.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.063
(<i> beep</i> )

13:18.130 --> 13:21.834
How could everything go so
wrong when I am so right?!

13:21.901 --> 13:23.836
I might have been
a little ambiguous.

13:23.903 --> 13:24.537
I want you out!

13:24.603 --> 13:26.105
Okay, there's that preposition

13:26.172 --> 13:27.540
at the end of
a sentence again.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.542
All right, I'm going.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.977
Sabrina wait.
You've got to help us.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.013
I'm sorry, but you and
your new karaoke machine

13:34.079 --> 13:36.415
are just going to
have to butcher
Celine Dion without me.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.851
I just figured out there's
no way we can even come close

13:38.918 --> 13:41.453
to making all of the minimum
payments on all of these cards.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.322
And they are not giving us
any more credit.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.091
They said that we have no
visible means of support.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.827
Which at first I thought
was a huge compliment.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.196
And even if we stop
spending today,

13:50.262 --> 13:52.298
we'll be in our 50s
before it's all paid off.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.600
I'm sorry, but I have
bigger fish to fry.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.336
Ooh, And that giant fish fryer
might come in quite handy.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.071
Sabrina, you have to help us.

13:59.138 --> 14:02.541
You're the one who led us down
this path of debt and despair.

14:02.608 --> 14:06.011
And here I was, feeling guilty
about forging your name.

14:06.078 --> 14:09.114
I'm sorry, but I thought
it was a perfectly perfect idea.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.349
I want my appendix back.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.953
This spell has cost me my job,
my friends' financial future

14:14.019 --> 14:14.853
a fabulous guy...

14:14.920 --> 14:17.990
Ooh, but my hair's
never looked better.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.092
Well, I can't help you
with the appendix.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.860
I put it down the
garbage disposal.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.562
It's sleeping
with the eggshells.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.532
What?! Never put eggshells
down the garbage disposal.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.968
There's got to be some way
to undo this spell.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.103
You know, being perfect
is perfectly awful.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.072
Salem, you've been around
hundreds of years.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.307
I mean, you've got to know
a way to reverse this.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.409
Well, I might be able
to pull some strings

14:37.476 --> 14:39.078
and get you into Mistake School.

14:39.144 --> 14:40.212
Mistake School?

14:40.279 --> 14:41.347
Yeah, it's a school

with mistakes.

been over this before.

14:51.657 --> 14:57.529
Once again from the top, the
comb-over, always a mistake.

14:57.596 --> 14:59.932
Thinking it's going to
clear up on its own?

14:59.999 --> 15:02.601
Excuse me. I'm Sabrina Spellman
and I misplaced my appendix.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.903
Consequently, I've lost my job
and my boyfriend.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.106
So, I really just need
to learn to make mistakes again

15:07.172 --> 15:08.173
and, uh, then I can go.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.608
Lost your boyfriend
and your job?

15:09.675 --> 15:12.344
Sounds like you already know
how to make mistakes.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.545
That's called irony.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.547
Okay, just tell me
what I need to do.

15:15.614 --> 15:17.583
Let's start with a review
of all of your mistakes.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.685
One moment, sir.
Why is her case up?

15:19.752 --> 15:23.489
I've been here since 1876 for
a mistake I didn't even make!

by a handful of Indians.

Whoo!

15:30.229 --> 15:31.163
That was a big mistake.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.331
Yeah.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.666
Hey, who took my pencil?

15:33.732 --> 15:35.668
I'm telling ya,
They ambushed us!

15:35.734 --> 15:37.036
My horse was lame!

15:37.102 --> 15:38.537
The sun was in my eyes!

15:38.604 --> 15:41.373
(<i> sotto</i> ):
I swear, I sell that screenplay,
I am so out of here.

15:41.440 --> 15:46.011
Okay, Sabrina Spellman, let's
take a look at your mistakes.

15:48.514 --> 15:52.017
Those are all my mistakes?
I'm not even that old!

15:52.084 --> 15:53.118
This is just the A's.

15:54.586 --> 15:57.990
Now we enter
the junior high years.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.959
So, obviously, you can get
a sunburn on a cloudy day.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.597
Oh, everybody was obsessed
with Madonna that year.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.232
And people said I looked hot.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.701
(<i> click</i> )

head eventually did grow back.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.585
What, that sentence
is perfect.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.554
Except that it ends
in a preposition.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.656
Mouthy little gal, ain't she?

16:30.723 --> 16:33.192
Two words: Sitting Bull.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.593
All right, point taken.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.695
I shouldn't have
corrected my boss.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.997
Let's go to a little later,
that same day.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.603
All right, all right,
I admit it, I make mistakes.

16:44.670 --> 16:48.607
I'm the worst person, witch,
employee, roommate, girlfriend,

16:48.674 --> 16:50.709
artichoke eater
in the world!

16:50.776 --> 16:54.012
You forgot student. You're
just not getting it, are you?

16:56.081 --> 16:57.583
SABRINA:
Hey, that's me!

16:57.649 --> 17:00.119
I'm a determined
little thing and cute.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.187
You fell on your keister
eleven hundred times

17:02.254 --> 17:04.256
before you finally
walked across that room.

17:04.323 --> 17:07.025
Hey, now, that is
just being unfair.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.594
Okay, I'm a baby.
That's what babies do.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.462
That's how they learn to walk.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.097
(<i> bells and whistles go off</i> )

17:12.164 --> 17:13.599
Oh, I get it.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.634
Mistakes are important
because we learn from them.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.703
So, instead of wishing
I'd never made any

17:17.770 --> 17:20.105
I should just embrace what
they teach me and move on.

17:20.172 --> 17:21.306
Exactly.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.343
And you couldn't have given me
this platitude two hours ago?

17:24.410 --> 17:25.577
(<i> magical ping</i> )
There you go.

17:25.644 --> 17:26.512
Congratulations.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.714
You're completely
fallible, error-prone

17:28.781 --> 17:31.150
and will definitely make
many, many mistakes

17:31.216 --> 17:32.351
during your lifetime.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.520
Thanks. Can't wait
to get started.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.822
So, does this
take effect right...

17:36.889 --> 17:38.724
I guess so.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.362
Okay, I'm sorry if I contributed
to this problem.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.597
I'm sorry
if I actually made it worse.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.167
And I'm sorry that I wasn't
espousing fiscal responsibility

17:48.233 --> 17:50.702
and sage advice, but I now know
exactly what we have to do.

17:50.769 --> 17:51.570
What?

17:51.637 --> 17:53.472
This.

17:56.508 --> 17:57.609
There.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.511
One of those was
my driver's license.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.580
Oh. My mistake.

18:02.781 --> 18:06.185
Look, I just want to say
that I'm really sorry if
I caused everyone grief.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.187
I think I was just so afraid
of making a mistake

18:08.253 --> 18:09.621
that I stepped in
a couple of big ones.

18:09.688 --> 18:10.789
Oh, no kidding.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.758
I'm probably going
to regret this

18:12.825 --> 18:16.428
and it's not going
to help my reputation
for being a softy

18:16.495 --> 18:19.097
but I'm willing to give
you one last chance.

18:19.164 --> 18:20.732
Whoo-hoo! Thank you so much.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.435
Oh, one last chance
starting now?

18:23.502 --> 18:24.603
Proof this.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.571
Will do.

18:25.637 --> 18:26.705
And don't clog the margins

18:26.772 --> 18:28.440
with your little happy faces.

18:28.507 --> 18:29.308
Won't do.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.410
And don't flag
anything except typos.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.312
Nope. No flags, no happy faces,

18:33.378 --> 18:36.748
unless it's my happy face
'cause I'm so happy to be back.

18:36.815 --> 18:39.485
Never mind. I need this done
now, and I need it done right.

18:39.551 --> 18:40.652
I'm going to give it to Esme.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.387
Her English is really improving.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.856
Well, okay.
You're the boss.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.691
Whatever you want is fine.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.159
It gives me a chance
to get started

18:47.226 --> 18:48.494
on a new article
I want to write.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.661
Don't waste your time.

18:49.728 --> 18:50.562
Oh, no, it's not a waste.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.564
I'm actually really
excited about it.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.299
Here, let me pitch it
to you real quick.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.267
I mean don't
waste my time.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.369
The last thing I need
to do is slog my way

18:57.436 --> 18:59.371
through another tedious
Spellman hack piece.

18:59.438 --> 19:00.906
Okay, maybe later.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.175
No, wait, wait a minute.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.377
Did you just
call me a hack?

19:05.444 --> 19:07.479
Mm, let me think.
Yes, I did.

19:07.546 --> 19:08.480
Oh, okay.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.582
No, not okay. Not okay at all.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.618
I beg your pardon?

19:12.684 --> 19:14.786
Look, I admit it, I might
make the occasional mistake,

19:14.853 --> 19:16.522
but the biggest
mistake I made here

19:16.588 --> 19:18.190
was not standing up
to you months ago.

19:18.257 --> 19:20.292
I'm not a hack, I'm
a really good writer.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.461
I bust my butt day in
and day out for you.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.696
I do not deserve to be
treated like this, ever.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.398
You go, girl!

19:27.266 --> 19:31.169
I mean, uh, you, Sabrina-girl,
go... home,

19:31.236 --> 19:32.671
and think about
what you just said.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.706
Oh, I don't have
to think about it.

19:34.773 --> 19:37.609
I know exactly what
I just said, and I
stand by it. I quit.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.711
Oh, so you're just going
to walk out of here?

19:39.778 --> 19:43.215
Do you know how difficult it is
to find a job in journalism?

19:43.282 --> 19:45.217
You're making a huge mistake.

19:45.284 --> 19:46.685
I don't think so.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.454
But if I am, I'll learn.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.928
Someday I like
to be the kind of girl

19:55.994 --> 19:57.729
who makes a graceful exit.

19:57.796 --> 19:59.431
AARON:
I certainly hope not.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.767
Hi. What are you doing here?

20:01.833 --> 20:04.703
I just wanted to
apologize for being
such a schmuck.

20:04.770 --> 20:08.473
I mean, what kind of guy
breaks up with a girl
over the phone?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.709
You're not going to do it
now in person, are you?

20:10.776 --> 20:13.712
No. Look, I realized
you were just trying

20:13.779 --> 20:16.748
to make everything...
perfect.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.750
And well, that's sweet
and flattering.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.453
Sabrina, I love it when you're
wrestling with vegetables

20:21.520 --> 20:22.754
and always showing up late.

20:22.821 --> 20:26.425
Well, actually, that last part
<i>is</i> a little bit annoying,

20:26.491 --> 20:29.628
but the point is, I don't
want somebody who's perfect.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.797
Well, then it's your lucky day.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.740
Absolutely perfect.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.682
That's fantastic. I'll see you

20:50.749 --> 20:52.618
first thing tomorrow morning.
Bye.

20:52.684 --> 20:55.621
Whoo-hoo! Salem,
I just booked my second
freelance assignment.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.422
Apparently, I'm
quite in demand.

20:57.489 --> 20:58.357
Yeah, that's great.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.425
Do you know where the tape is?

21:00.492 --> 21:01.860
There you go.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.729
Wait a second.

21:03.795 --> 21:05.497
What is this for?

21:05.564 --> 21:07.332
Why do you
always go there?

21:07.399 --> 21:10.268
It's a roll of tape,
not C-4 plastic explosives.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.637
Maybe I got you something,

21:11.703 --> 21:14.006
and I'd like to give
it a decent wrapping

21:14.072 --> 21:16.708
instead of sticking it
in some cheesy gift-bag.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.477
All right, jeez, I'm sorry.

21:18.543 --> 21:21.413
I guess I just thought that
maybe you'd try to use this

21:21.480 --> 21:24.416
to tape these up
and use them.
