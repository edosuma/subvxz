00:22.682 --> 00:24.336
Captain Nguyen will be reopening

It's Admiral Buenamigo.

-Captain Freeman.

00:41.962 --> 00:44.139
Quite the payload
you've got us hauling.

Are you trying to inebriate
half the Gamma Quadrant?

Anything to open up
communications.

17:48.684 --> 17:50.120
It's... [coughs, clears throat]

17:50.164 --> 17:51.991
-Wait, it is a little stuffy.
-I need air!

17:52.035 --> 17:53.558
Everybody, just keep calm, okay?

17:53.602 --> 17:54.777
-What is going on?
-WENDY: Oh, my God!

17:54.820 --> 17:57.301
MARINER:
Ah, the Impulian candles.

17:57.345 --> 17:58.737
The flames eat twice the oxygen.
[blowing]

17:58.781 --> 17:59.999
-[gasps]
-Wait, wait, wait,

18:00.043 --> 18:01.088
our intentions.

18:01.131 --> 18:02.132
[sighs] Everybody, okay,

18:02.176 --> 18:03.177
let's calm down, all right?

18:03.220 --> 18:05.092
[overlapping talking]

18:05.135 --> 18:06.658
If I could have
your attention, please.

18:06.702 --> 18:08.443
Ladies.

18:08.486 --> 18:11.054
Why are you being so polite?
This doesn't sound like you.

18:11.098 --> 18:12.708
Because I've been trying
this whole time

18:12.751 --> 18:14.971
not to be bossy or mean
to your friends.

18:15.014 --> 18:17.147
-Why?
-Because if they didn't like me,

18:17.191 --> 18:19.149
you'd get mad
and this wouldn't work out.

18:19.193 --> 18:22.587
Beckett, I like that you
don't take [bleep] from anyone.

18:22.631 --> 18:24.459
-Really?
-Yes.

18:24.502 --> 18:26.156
I know my friends
can be a bit much.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.811
I've been looking forward to you
tearing them a new one.

18:28.854 --> 18:30.639
Go destroy them.

18:30.682 --> 18:32.206
[sighs] Thanks, babe.

18:32.249 --> 18:34.164
-Everyone, shut the [bleep] up!
-[others gasp]

18:34.208 --> 18:37.254
Ugh. You can't tell us
what to do. This is my salon.

18:37.298 --> 18:38.734
-MARINER: And this is my phaser.
-[gasps]

18:38.777 --> 18:40.344
Hey, did you know that,
when you're unconscious,

18:40.388 --> 18:42.085
you actually consume
way less oxygen?

18:42.129 --> 18:43.913
So? What does that
have to do... [grunts]

18:43.956 --> 18:46.350
-Oh, my God, she stunned her.
-[gasps] What are you doing?

18:46.394 --> 18:49.092
-Just actualizing my dreams.
-No!

18:49.136 --> 18:52.095
-[screaming]
-[whoops, laughs]

18:59.494 --> 19:02.061
Oh, man, we're almost
to the wormhole!

19:02.105 --> 19:03.150
[gasps] Mesk.

19:03.193 --> 19:04.890
Mesk, you can save us!

19:04.934 --> 19:07.197
-Um, I'm sorry, what?
-With all your pirating skills.

19:07.241 --> 19:09.199
You can take the ship
Orion-style.

19:09.243 --> 19:12.637
Right, totally.
Um, the, uh, thing with that is,

19:12.681 --> 19:13.856
um... I, uh...

19:13.899 --> 19:15.814
I don't know how.
I've never

19:15.858 --> 19:17.686
pirated anything
in my whole stupid life.

19:17.729 --> 19:20.689
-What? It's all you talk about!
-I'm a faker.

19:20.732 --> 19:24.345
I don't know. I've, I've
never even been to Orion.

19:24.388 --> 19:25.911
I-I'm from Cincinnati.

19:25.955 --> 19:28.262
-What? Cincinnati?
-Are you freaking serious?

19:28.305 --> 19:30.264
I got adopted by humans,

19:30.307 --> 19:31.961
and everything
I know about Orions

19:32.004 --> 19:33.658
I learned from the holonovels.

19:33.702 --> 19:36.226
Bad ones, too. The ones
with the boobs on the cover.

19:36.270 --> 19:37.706
Why would you lie?

19:37.749 --> 19:39.447
Well, people just expect Orions

19:39.490 --> 19:41.536
to act like that,
so it's always worked for me.

19:41.579 --> 19:43.146
I never knew any other Orions

19:43.190 --> 19:45.627
back in Ohio, so no one
ever checked me on it.

19:45.670 --> 19:47.281
[sighs]

19:47.324 --> 19:49.108
Yeah, I-I get that.

19:49.152 --> 19:51.328
It's hard when you feel like
people expect you to act

19:51.372 --> 19:53.939
a certain way, but you just
got to be yourself.

19:53.983 --> 19:55.724
It doesn't matter
what other people expect.

19:55.767 --> 19:58.161
I'm sorry that I put
all that on you, too.

19:58.205 --> 20:01.208
Thanks, and I'm sure
the real Mesk is great, too.

20:01.251 --> 20:02.644
The Ohio Mesk.

20:02.687 --> 20:05.734
Ugh, I just feel bad
'cause actual

20:05.777 --> 20:08.432
Orion pirating skills really
would come in handy right now.

20:08.476 --> 20:11.000
Yup, you're right about that.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.002
-[grunting]
-Whoa.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.569
What the...?

20:16.135 --> 20:18.703
Listen, if there's one thing
my father taught me,

20:18.747 --> 20:20.966
it's that every ship
has a security fail-safe.

20:21.010 --> 20:23.404
Your family's Orion pirates?

20:23.447 --> 20:25.493
Yup, Syndicate and all.

20:27.495 --> 20:29.758
-You there, stop.
-[grunting]

20:42.597 --> 20:43.685
-[gasps]
-Wait a minute, wait a minute.

20:43.728 --> 20:44.729
That thing has a tooth remover?

20:44.773 --> 20:47.123
Shh, I'm pirating. Let's go!

20:49.821 --> 20:51.954
Whoa, you just did that
with a wine opener!

20:51.997 --> 20:54.130
-[panting]
-[shouting]

20:54.173 --> 20:56.872
[screaming]

20:56.915 --> 20:58.482
Oh, no!

20:58.526 --> 20:59.875
Wormhole!

21:14.324 --> 21:15.673
You stopped us? How?

21:15.717 --> 21:17.240
I used the latinum
from the guy's tooth

21:17.284 --> 21:19.198
to magnetically decouple
the propulsion controls.

21:19.242 --> 21:21.375
You took the ship...
You took the ship!

21:21.418 --> 21:23.333
Ugh, my folks would be so proud,

21:23.377 --> 21:24.943
but this is only
a temporary fix.

21:24.987 --> 21:26.467
In a couple of hours,

21:26.510 --> 21:27.903
the Karemma are gonna
figure out what I did,

21:27.946 --> 21:28.773
-and when they do... Whoa!
-[rumbling]

21:28.817 --> 21:30.732
We're in a tractor beam.

21:30.775 --> 21:32.821
[laughs] We're saved.

21:32.864 --> 21:34.126
KIRA:
We got 'em.

21:34.170 --> 21:35.389
Good work, people.

21:35.432 --> 21:37.086
Wonder why they
just stopped and waited.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.740
I mean, they were
as good as Gamma'd.

21:38.783 --> 21:41.873
Beam 'em to the brig first,
ask questions later.

21:41.917 --> 21:44.311
[blows]
Well, I definitely didn't have

21:44.354 --> 21:46.530
"phaser all your friends"
on my bingo card.

21:46.574 --> 21:48.227
And that's what I like
about us--

21:48.271 --> 21:50.317
you keep things unexpected.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.972
Though, you know, us being
the only ones not stunned here?

21:54.016 --> 21:55.365
Kind of a bad look.

21:55.409 --> 21:56.714
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
I see that.

21:56.758 --> 21:59.282
Welp, shall we?

21:59.326 --> 22:00.588
Mwah.

22:09.423 --> 22:12.556
Let me out of here. This
imprisonment will not stand.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.602
You kidnapped
an innocent Ferengi.

22:14.645 --> 22:15.994
If I can quickly interject,

22:16.038 --> 22:18.083
this is just
a big misunderstanding,

22:18.127 --> 22:21.086
and I'm sure we can work out
some sort of resolution.

22:21.130 --> 22:24.394
A resolution for what?
You stole our technology.

22:24.438 --> 22:27.658
-Your technology?
-The Quark 2000.

22:27.702 --> 22:29.268
He stole it from us.

22:29.312 --> 22:31.445
It's filled
with Karemma components.

22:31.488 --> 22:32.707
So, you didn't kidnap him?

22:32.750 --> 22:34.883
No. We arrested him.

22:36.058 --> 22:38.756
I may have borrowed

22:38.800 --> 22:40.584
a Karemma replicator
some years ago,

22:40.628 --> 22:43.805
but it was my codes
that made it so popular.

22:43.848 --> 22:45.589
Oh, that's beside the point.

22:45.633 --> 22:48.766
I think I have a solution
that will make you both happy.

22:50.899 --> 22:52.727
FREEMAN:
Captain's log, supplemental.

22:52.770 --> 22:54.598
Our mission, though unexpected,

22:54.642 --> 22:56.774
has been a resounding success.

22:56.818 --> 22:59.298
The Karemma have agreed
to open up trade

22:59.342 --> 23:00.561
and not imprison Quark

23:00.604 --> 23:02.911
in exchange for 76%

23:02.954 --> 23:04.956
of all his franchises' profits.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.132
-Yes, yes, it's on him.
-[laughter]

23:07.176 --> 23:10.309
Th-Th-That table wants more
top-shelf Tamarian mead,

23:10.353 --> 23:12.442
a-and they're insisting
that it's on the house.

23:12.486 --> 23:14.139
Just bring them what they want.

23:14.183 --> 23:17.404
[sighs] I thought
you said your plan

23:17.447 --> 23:19.275
would make us both happy.

23:19.318 --> 23:21.582
Well, you're happier being poor
than in prison, aren't you?

23:21.625 --> 23:23.018
No!

23:23.061 --> 23:24.585
Sorry, I didn't
win over your friends.

23:24.628 --> 23:27.457
Please, even better,
now they're scared of you.

23:27.501 --> 23:28.806
-[gasps]
-Shh, shh.

23:28.850 --> 23:29.981
She's looking, she's looking,

23:30.025 --> 23:31.461
-don't look.
-[both laugh]

23:31.505 --> 23:34.638
One Risa Colada
and a Mind Meld. Mariner.

23:34.682 --> 23:37.206
You'd better have a stack
of latinum down there.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.252
Uh, nope. But I do have a copy
of that hologram

23:40.296 --> 23:41.602
with your head on Kira's body.

23:41.645 --> 23:43.473
Impossible. [stammers]
I erased that.

23:43.517 --> 23:44.866
-How about we clear my tab?
-[grunting]

23:44.909 --> 23:46.955
Unless you're not afraid
of Kira seeing this.

23:46.998 --> 23:48.347
-Mariner.
-[shrieks]

23:48.391 --> 23:49.610
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

23:49.653 --> 23:51.263
Are you guys
telling war stories?

23:51.307 --> 23:53.657
I was just clearing her tab,
for old time's sake.

23:53.701 --> 23:55.093
What is on that chip?

23:55.137 --> 23:56.138
-No!
-No, give that to me,

23:56.181 --> 23:57.182
give it to me.

23:57.226 --> 23:59.402
-[laughter]
-Quark.

23:59.446 --> 24:01.839
[screams]

24:01.883 --> 24:04.320
-CROWD: Dabo!
-Listen, you could

24:04.363 --> 24:05.974
walk out of here
with all that latinum,

24:06.017 --> 24:08.585
that germy, dirty latinum, or...

24:08.629 --> 24:12.502
a gift certificate for twice its
value at our Quark's gift store.

24:12.546 --> 24:14.591
[gasps] Quark's bucks.
I'll take it.

24:14.635 --> 24:16.854
[chuckles] We don't even use
money in Starfleet anyway.

24:16.898 --> 24:19.117
What?

24:19.161 --> 24:21.468
Oh, it was good to see you
today, old-timer.

24:21.511 --> 24:24.383
Yes. The prophets smiled
on both of us.

24:24.427 --> 24:27.038
Thanks for having my back
when the klisht hit the fan.

24:27.082 --> 24:29.476
-Just doing my job.
-Now I do owe you one.

24:29.519 --> 24:30.825
Wait, what? No.

24:30.868 --> 24:33.349
-No, no, no. Hey, come on.
-[laughs]

24:33.392 --> 24:35.177
Gotcha.

24:35.220 --> 24:38.310
But then the way you, like,
dance-flip-konked that guard,

24:38.354 --> 24:39.747
I was like, damn!

24:39.790 --> 24:41.096
I didn't know
Tendi could do that.

24:41.139 --> 24:42.184
[chuckles] Well,
so you're not embarrassed

24:42.227 --> 24:43.402
to be friends with someone

24:43.446 --> 24:45.404
whose family was into pirating?

24:45.448 --> 24:47.711
No way.
It's a part of who you are.

24:47.755 --> 24:49.017
I like hearing about it.

24:49.060 --> 24:50.888
Thanks, Rutherford. From now on,

24:50.932 --> 24:53.630
I'm going to embrace my past
and what comes with it.

24:53.674 --> 24:56.198
Uh, what are you gonna do
with the tooth?

24:56.241 --> 24:58.505
I don't know, i-it's actually
kind of gross, isn't it?

24:58.548 --> 25:00.028
I'll take that.

25:00.071 --> 25:01.682
Rule of Acquisition number nine.

25:01.725 --> 25:05.337
Opportunity plus instinct
equals profit.

26:02.656 --> 26:04.179
[man imitates weapons firing]

26:06.137 --> 26:10.137
Chirp.
