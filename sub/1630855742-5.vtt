WEBVTT

01:55.449 --> 01:57.284
- <i>We're live in two.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:57.284 --> 02:00.412
Okay. Alison's got chills.
Marshall's covering B cam,

02:00.412 --> 02:03.582
but I don't know if he can do it.
And Joel has a throat tickle.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.792
Geez. Do you have any good news?

02:07.753 --> 02:09.505
- Hey, six feet.
- I'm sorry.

02:09.505 --> 02:11.173
- Hi, Julia.
- Good morning.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.966
- Morning.
- Alex's fever broke.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.760
- That's great. When is she coming back?
- Yeah.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.596
Stella wants Alex and Chip
to keep doing their thing.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.515
- Really?
- Yeah. How are things on your end?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.225
I mean, I guess I'm fine.

02:21.225 --> 02:24.102
I'm doing my own hair and makeup.
I'm getting dressed in the green room.

02:24.102 --> 02:28.023
I've been okay for the past two weeks.
I think I'm in the clear.

02:28.023 --> 02:32.236
Okay. Stella says you're good to go.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.779
Thank you. You're my hero.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.447
Yeah. Keep saying it. Okay.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.699
You look like a dream.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.743
<i>Really? I feel pretty ragged.</i>

02:40.244 --> 02:41.161
Hi, Laura.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.454
<i>Morning, Bradley.</i>

02:43.205 --> 02:45.165
I made some changes to the Cuomo copy.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.125
There was a new executive order
last night.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.794
Got it. What else?

02:48.794 --> 02:50.128
Have a great show.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.005
- Always do.
- Five,

02:52.005 --> 02:55.926
- four, three, two.
- Marshall, is your camera even on?

02:57.970 --> 03:01.056
Good morning. It's Wednesday, March 25th,

03:01.056 --> 03:05.477
and the 2020 Summer Olympics
have officially been postponed.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.022
Okay. Bill Simpson just quit,
and he's moving to Costa Rica.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.940
Who?

03:09.940 --> 03:12.860
He's the EVP of scripted.
You know, the smart one.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.904
He's pissed 'cause I canceled
all the pilots that he just green-lit.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.072
Well, what else could you do?

03:17.072 --> 03:19.032
You know no one's gonna step foot
on a film set right now.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.701
Well, he's dead to us,
and I need your help.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.744
- Yeah, I'm a little busy.
- We're desperate for content.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.623
<i>The Donner Party</i> cast, they're stuck
on location with a food shortage.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.749
You're kidding.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.752
And Sorkin won't release
his Kissinger biopic to UBA+.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.671
- Why did you green-light that?
- Self-hate.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.007
- That tracks.
- I need you to talk to him.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.092
- You're gonna owe me.
- Okay, good. You can put it on my tab.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.845
Did you see Alex's thing
has over two million streams?

03:39.845 --> 03:43.223
- Everybody stops to watch a house on fire.
- Do you want me to put it out?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.142
Put it out? No.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.812
I want you to hit the street
with a gas can and see what lights up.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.315
We need stakes. We need spectacle.

03:51.315 --> 03:56.904
We need the undeniable essence
that is Alex fucking Levy.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.113
I'll be back.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.367
<i>The fridge is full.</i>

04:02.367 --> 04:05.579
The wine is chilled.
I'm just missing one thing.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.374
- Toilet paper?
- <i>Actually, yeah. I need that too.</i>

04:09.374 --> 04:11.001
- Hey. Look who's here.
- Hey, Brad--

04:11.001 --> 04:12.628
Oh, Laura.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.379
<i>Hi, Cory.</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:17.882
- <i>Call me later, okay?</i>
- Yeah. I'll call you back. Bye.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.012
Okay. Was the show okay?

04:22.012 --> 04:24.139
Yeah, good stuff.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.308
So what's up?

04:26.308 --> 04:29.436
I'm just checking in.
Have you got enough food?

04:29.436 --> 04:32.856
Do you want a dog, or a kitten or
some other kind of animal companion?

04:33.774 --> 04:34.775
- I'm good.
- Okay.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.195
I checked with BA, and they're happy
to put you in an apartment.

04:38.195 --> 04:42.491
Well, I really appreciate that, but
I'm actually checking out of the hotel.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.618
Okay. Good. Where you goin'?

04:45.327 --> 04:46.370
Montana.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.874
Laura and I have been talking,
and it's just much safer out there,

04:50.874 --> 04:54.127
and I'll be remote and--

04:54.127 --> 04:55.629
Unless, of course, you need me here.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.590
No. That makes sense.

04:58.590 --> 05:03.345
It'd be good for ratings, you know. Good.

05:06.348 --> 05:12.020
You know none of this
has anything to do with... you know,

05:12.020 --> 05:13.939
what happened between you and I with Hal.

05:14.439 --> 05:18.610
That was just, like--
That was a crazy night,

05:18.610 --> 05:22.447
and it was just-- We were-- We weren't--

05:22.447 --> 05:25.409
We were going a little bit
out of our minds, weren't we?

05:28.579 --> 05:31.290
Yeah, right. Were we?

05:34.877 --> 05:35.878
I was.

05:37.713 --> 05:38.922
Yeah. Okay.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.011
How is Hal?

05:45.345 --> 05:48.432
So much better. Thank you.
Yeah, he's with my mom now, you know.

05:48.432 --> 05:49.516
That's great.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.185
Thank you for asking.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.900
Hope you see a moose.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.225
How was your day?

06:31.225 --> 06:33.268
- Shitty.
- You said that yesterday.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.233
I missed you too.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.084
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:46.717 --> 07:47.968
I'm gonna go get some water.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.471
No, don't go. Too soon. Stay.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.932
I'd get you water. Do you need water?

07:54.433 --> 07:57.311
No. But can we have, like, champagne?

07:58.312 --> 07:59.980
- Well, I got that too, honey.
- Really?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.107
You came to the right house. Yes.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.692
Yeah, I knew I came to the right house.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.528
- Now, we don't have to work till tomorrow.
- Okay.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.530
So we could spend the whole day in bed
if we wanted to.

08:08.530 --> 08:09.823
Oh, my God. Can we?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.291
You know, people will speculate.
They always do.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.044
I mean, I'm in a pod with you
during the pandemic.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.921
It's a little more than that.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.256
Does it bother you?

08:29.259 --> 08:34.222
No. I don't know.
Our personal relationship is our business.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.558
Okay. So we just won't say anything
about it on air.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.519
Okay.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.187
Okay.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.731
You have a little--

08:47.778 --> 08:50.572
- Okay. Time to work.
- Okay. Time to work.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.081
- Salma?
- Cory.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.752
Are we doing masks, no masks?

09:03.752 --> 09:05.629
What's the policy today?

09:05.629 --> 09:07.256
I don't watch the news.

09:07.756 --> 09:12.010
Well, why don't we leave them on?
Till we get to know each other better.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.471
Right. Better safe than sorry, huh?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.598
Can't wait to show you this house.

09:17.808 --> 09:21.228
I love this place. I think you will too.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.856
But I've got five more to show you,
if this is not the one.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.315
Okay. Wow, big lot.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.609
UBA+ must be doing very well.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.779
You're a subscriber.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.407
I will be, if you buy through me.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.662
Okay.
Well, fair warning, I'm a little picky.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.625
Good. I've got all the time in the world.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.503
Yeah, I understand but--

09:47.921 --> 09:50.132
By the time that I get there
and I quarantine,

09:50.132 --> 09:51.383
then Mother's Day will be over.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.760
And then I have to come back here
and quarantine again.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.639
Yeah, but, Brad, we both know that if
you wanted to, you could make it work.

09:57.639 --> 09:58.765
<i>Hal, that's not fair.</i>

09:58.765 --> 10:02.311
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to
make you feel guilty. I swear to God.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.897
I'll be there as soon as
the restrictions lift, okay?

10:05.564 --> 10:08.192
Just take care of Mom and text me anytime.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.276
Okay.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.153
- <i>Are you good?</i>
- Yeah. I love you.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.113
I love you too.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.202
How's he doing?

10:19.161 --> 10:21.330
Yeah. Seems like he's doing pretty good.

10:22.581 --> 10:27.544
My mom is still going to church,
and he's not wearing a mask at Costco.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.840
Our education system is broken.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.552
You know Hal and I
went to the same schools.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.930
Yeah, but only one of you
learned about science.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.350
That's my family.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.271
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
It was a joke. Really.

10:46.980 --> 10:51.026
No, I know you don't like where I'm from,
but I have a lot of that world in me,

10:51.026 --> 10:52.194
and--

10:55.030 --> 11:00.160
I need you to understand
or attempt to understand,

11:00.744 --> 11:02.663
if you're gonna love me.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.876
I'm judgy.

11:08.877 --> 11:09.878
A little bit.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.007
Or I'm doing the mommy thing,
which is awful.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.593
It's probably about my own childhood.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.305
Or maybe I'm just an asshole.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.351
But yes, I want to try.

11:26.436 --> 11:30.524
Hold on. Is this compassionate engagement
around our traumas?

11:30.524 --> 11:32.568
Is this an adult conversation?

11:32.568 --> 11:34.361
Definitely a lesbian conversation.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.072
Followed by chocolate.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.617
- No, I want chocolate too.
- Nope. It's only for bisexuals.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.245
It's my house. I get the chocolate.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.584
I'm really happy with you.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.962
- <i>Eight seconds to you.</i>
- <i>Stand by for live feed.</i>

11:51.962 --> 11:54.631
- <i>Five, four, three...</i>
- I'm really happy with you too.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.467
- <i>...two. Start your move. Cue her.</i>
- I want people to know that.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.803
So what? Make it official?

12:00.512 --> 12:02.806
<i>Bradley. Bradley, you're on.</i>

12:04.808 --> 12:05.642
Right.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.061
- Good morning. It's May 14th.
- Fifteenth.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.813
Fifteenth. Sorry, y'all.

12:10.689 --> 12:13.567
Babe, you gotta make some stronger coffee.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.695
Oh, no. I need you at half speed
when we go for our run later.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.281
Well, tomorrow I'm gonna make the coffee.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.240
No.

12:20.866 --> 12:23.869
- I make good coffee.
- I didn't say anything.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.580
People will talk about this house.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.958
They're gonna want to know
about the man who lives inside.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.084
I love it.

12:31.627 --> 12:35.088
So picture this. You just closed
the biggest deal of your life.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.927
You've got the perfect bottle of wine,
two glasses.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.262
There's two glasses?

12:43.639 --> 12:45.349
I'm not gonna make you drink alone.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.936
I see. You're here now too.

12:50.229 --> 12:52.606
Just wanna make sure you're happy
with your purchase.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.484
You do this with all your clients?

12:56.902 --> 12:59.488
No, Cory. You're special.

13:04.034 --> 13:07.120
I've been thinking about you.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.998
What have you been thinking?

13:12.209 --> 13:13.544
That I wanna get to know you.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.342
Maybe you'd let me cook you dinner.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.597
What if I want more than dinner?

13:28.851 --> 13:29.935
Can I see you?

13:32.771 --> 13:34.815
I mean, can I really see you?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.000
Hi.

13:53.876 --> 13:54.877
Hi.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.590
<i>No justice! No peace!</i>

13:59.590 --> 14:05.554
<i>No fucking police!
No justice! No peace! No fucking police!</i>

14:06.263 --> 14:09.433
It's great, but we can't use it on <i>TMS</i>.

14:09.433 --> 14:10.767
<i>Even if we bleep it?</i>

14:11.476 --> 14:12.769
We need personal stories.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.647
Interviews with protesters talking about
why they're marching

14:15.647 --> 14:17.024
and what it means to them.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.860
<i>Okay. Well, I can be on the ground
in Minneapolis by tomorrow.</i>

14:19.860 --> 14:21.069
Eric's already on the ground.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.698
What's your take on this, Mia?
How are you feeling?

14:27.618 --> 14:29.036
I agree with Stella.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.001
- Sit tight, we'll get you some footage.
- <i>Okay.</i>

14:36.001 --> 14:38.253
<i>George Floyd! George Floyd!</i>

14:38.253 --> 14:40.506
<i>- George Floyd!
- George Floyd!</i>

14:40.506 --> 14:44.176
<i>- No justice! No peace!
- No justice! No peace!</i>

14:45.761 --> 14:46.762
Hey, Fancy Face.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.847
<i>When? Now. When? Now.</i>

14:48.847 --> 14:51.391
Was just gonna run the shower.
You wanna jump in with me?

14:54.478 --> 14:55.479
Sorry.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.066
What's wrong?

15:00.984 --> 15:05.113
André, do you think this country
will ever change?

15:07.366 --> 15:09.326
'Cause I spent my day arguing over

15:09.910 --> 15:13.455
what protest footage
our middle-class, mostly white audience

15:13.455 --> 15:15.999
would be willing to watch
without changing the channel.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.294
Then air it all. Let 'em squirm.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.047
Okay. Yeah. I can't.

15:22.047 --> 15:26.510
Why not? The only way change happens
is when people see it for themselves.

15:31.098 --> 15:34.560
I've seen him die, like, 20 times.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.565
They're killing him,
he's calling out for his mama.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.360
They're all just standing around,
letting it happen.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.160
God, I just--

15:54.580 --> 15:56.290
- Oh, God.
- Hey.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.003
Hey, I'm here.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.679
Oh, God.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.350
It's been a fucking week.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.394
No shit.

16:19.521 --> 16:22.065
People are stuck at home.
Their only friend is the TV,

16:22.065 --> 16:24.526
and we got nothing to show them
because everything is shut down.

16:24.526 --> 16:27.154
Okay. Chip has a new pitch every week,
and Eric wants to do more.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.573
- Just increase my budget and I can be--
- Hey, I can't.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.826
No one will loan to us
since the Hannah Shoenfeld suit.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.245
The vultures, they're circling right now,
and I'm telling ya,

16:35.245 --> 16:38.081
they see that stock drop, they're gonna
swoop down and eat our livers.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.375
What about, like,
more interviews with Alex?

16:40.959 --> 16:42.294
People love that. For <i>Alex Unfiltered</i>.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.754
Great. That's one show.

16:43.754 --> 16:46.757
- People love those interviews.
- We got the Mitch Kessler documentary.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.675
- What else do we have?
- I can talk to the director.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.427
She'd let us air that.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.307
That silence is deafening.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.684
You really want to give him
more airtime right now?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.853
Well, it shows him in a different light.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.648
He's regretful. He's repentant.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.026
And it would drive traffic to UBA+.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.778
In the middle of these protests?

17:07.778 --> 17:12.449
I think the American public can hold
more than one idea at a time.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.576
Cory, people are dying.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.537
They're getting shot and suffocated.

17:17.204 --> 17:21.541
Watching Mitch meditate on his sins
in some fancy Italian villa,

17:22.376 --> 17:23.460
that feels tone-deaf.

17:23.460 --> 17:27.214
Fine, then get me something else
and make it cheap.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.598
What is it?

17:36.598 --> 17:38.684
I need five billion dollars.

17:39.852 --> 17:40.811
That's all?

17:53.615 --> 17:56.159
There's money all over this shoreline.

17:56.159 --> 18:01.665
I mean, David Koch, Larry Page.
Most of 'em stay holed up in their houses.

18:01.665 --> 18:07.004
You don't even see them.
But sometimes they come out to play.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.215
Do you know Paul Marks?

18:12.676 --> 18:14.720
I thought he lived on the floor
of his factory.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.848
He bought up here a few years ago.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.436
I hear it's hard to get his attention.

18:26.940 --> 18:31.236
<i>CEO pay is 278 times higher
than the average worker.</i>

18:31.236 --> 18:33.405
<i>Did you have a question
or are you asking me to comment</i>

18:33.405 --> 18:34.990
<i>on the general state
of the American economy?</i>

18:34.990 --> 18:37.201
<i>I'm asking if you think that's ethical.</i>

18:37.201 --> 18:41.163
<i>Well, upwards of a billion people
will die in our lifetime</i>

18:41.163 --> 18:44.249
<i>due to the effects of man-made climate
destruction. Do you think that's ethical?</i>

18:44.875 --> 18:47.044
- <i>That's a separate issue.</i>
- <i>I think it's the only issue,</i>

18:47.044 --> 18:49.004
<i>and it's something
I'm actively working on.</i>

18:49.004 --> 18:52.382
<i>So, a billion people are gonna die,
but you wanna bitch about my paycheck?</i>

18:52.382 --> 18:56.845
<i>The richest 1% emit twice as much CO2
as the bottom 50% of the world.</i>

18:56.845 --> 18:59.306
<i>Well, I'd say you're missing the forest
for the trees,</i>

18:59.306 --> 19:01.642
<i>but I don't think you'd appreciate
the irony of that statement.</i>

19:01.642 --> 19:05.521
<i>But congratulations, you know a fact.</i>

19:06.522 --> 19:07.606
<i>I think we're done here.</i>

19:10.984 --> 19:13.779
<i>Have you been able to spend
any time with your families?</i>

19:13.779 --> 19:18.700
<i>It's been 41 days since I've been home
with my husband and daughter.</i>

19:19.993 --> 19:22.871
<i>We walk with death.
I've never seen anything like this.</i>

19:22.871 --> 19:24.831
- <i>My God, it's like a war zone.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

19:24.831 --> 19:27.960
<i>And yet, we provide our soldiers
with protective gear,</i>

19:27.960 --> 19:30.170
<i>and here you guys are fighting people
for masks.</i>

19:30.170 --> 19:32.172
- <i>And ventilators, and beds.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

19:32.172 --> 19:35.092
<i>Our zip code has
the highest rate of COVID in the state.</i>

19:35.092 --> 19:37.553
<i>Our patients can't afford
to stay home from work or isolate.</i>

19:37.553 --> 19:38.470
She's really good.

19:38.470 --> 19:41.640
<i>Everyone's just trying to survive.
But it's really hard.</i>

19:41.640 --> 19:44.101
<i>How can we help you?
What is it that you need?</i>

19:44.101 --> 19:47.020
Maybe they'll give her <i>Evening News</i>.
I hear Eric's leaving.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.355
It could be you.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.607
You should talk to Stella.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.277
- <i>...you are giving and sacrificing...</i>
- Okay. Yeah.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.114
<i>Jackie and Roberta,
thank you for taking this time today and--</i>

19:57.114 --> 19:58.323
Emma called.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.576
Still okay for her and Sam
to come stay with us?

20:00.576 --> 20:02.327
- Yeah, sure.
- You sure?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.915
I mean, I wish we were going out
instead of them coming in, but yeah.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.000
Okay.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.543
Your friends.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.754
- <i>...talking to us.</i>
- <i>Thank you for talking to us.</i>

20:25.893 --> 20:29.146
Thank goodness. Talk to me
while I cut a million strawberries.

20:29.688 --> 20:33.984
Hey. Listen to me. Mom has COVID.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.031
For how long?

20:40.240 --> 20:43.493
Okay. Look, I can get on a flight,
and I'll be there by tomorrow.

20:44.286 --> 20:47.706
No. Just stay where you are.
I don't need you getting sick too.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.125
Then I'll have, like, two people
with COVID in the house.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.127
I've-- I gave her Tylenol.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.795
- <i>Her fever's not that bad.</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

20:54.296 --> 20:57.049
<i>Put the little oxygen thing
on her finger. I'm watching it.</i>

20:57.674 --> 20:59.760
Okay. Can you put her on the phone?
I want to talk to her.

21:00.594 --> 21:03.347
She's asleep. Just-- It's okay.

21:03.347 --> 21:06.558
<i>Just-- I got this. Take a breath.</i>

21:07.518 --> 21:09.561
I just-- I feel like I should be there.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.396
No, you shouldn't.
'Cause she needs to rest,

21:11.396 --> 21:15.901
and you'll just get her all riled up. And
then that wouldn't be good for anybody.

21:15.901 --> 21:19.321
Okay, Hal. Just please wear gloves
and masked all the time, okay?

21:19.321 --> 21:21.949
- It's gonna be all right.
- <i>And tell her not to smoke. Okay?</i>

21:21.949 --> 21:22.991
I promise.

21:22.991 --> 21:27.204
And if anything changes, just call me,
text me anytime.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.830
- Morning or night. Do you hear me?
- I'll be right back.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.415
<i>Brad, you are always coming to the rescue.</i>

21:30.415 --> 21:32.376
No, I can be there really fast.

21:32.376 --> 21:33.710
<i>Trust me. I love you.</i>

21:33.710 --> 21:35.838
- Okay. I love you.
- <i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

21:40.551 --> 21:41.635
My mom has COVID.

21:43.762 --> 21:46.014
- Oh, my God.
- And I don't know where she got it,

21:46.014 --> 21:49.142
and I'm sure she wasn't wearing a mask,
so don't even ask me. I don't know.

21:50.519 --> 21:51.687
Do you wanna go to her?

21:51.687 --> 21:53.438
Yeah. I feel like I should.

21:53.438 --> 21:56.066
But then I talked to Hal,
and he doesn't think there's any point.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.860
And then I might get sick and then--

21:58.861 --> 22:01.697
Okay. I can call my cardiologist.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.532
She knows people at Johns Hopkins.

22:03.532 --> 22:06.660
If Hal can get your mom to Baltimore,
she can get better care.

22:06.660 --> 22:09.204
I wish she would.
I wish she would call her own doctor.

22:09.788 --> 22:13.292
You don't understand.
That's just not how my family works.

22:13.292 --> 22:16.879
He's gonna keep calling me.
If anything happens, I'm gonna go.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.214
- Of course.
- Like that, I gotta go.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.257
I understand that.

22:41.111 --> 22:45.490
Okay. Hi, hello. No. Singer. Yes. Madonna.

22:47.576 --> 22:50.871
Movie. Okay. Actress. What are you doing?

22:51.872 --> 22:53.123
What's this? What is that?

22:53.123 --> 22:54.791
<i>West Side Story</i>? I don't know.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.461
Wait. <i>Pulp Fiction</i>!

22:57.461 --> 22:58.754
Wait, time.

22:58.754 --> 23:01.590
- Liza Minnelli!
- <i>Cabaret</i>. That was amazing.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.258
It was so obvious. I knew it.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.177
I was totally transported
to Weimar Germany.

23:05.177 --> 23:06.887
- I'm sorry.
- Your turn.

23:06.887 --> 23:08.138
- It's okay, babe.
- Okay.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.473
- Okay.
- Sam, it's your turn.

23:09.473 --> 23:10.682
Take it easy on me, okay?

23:12.768 --> 23:13.769
I gotta take this.

23:15.354 --> 23:17.314
- Hey.
- <i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

23:17.314 --> 23:18.941
Yeah. I can't hear you.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.277
Hal, I can't hear you. Slow down. What?

23:22.277 --> 23:24.279
- Well, here's to you.
- What?

23:27.616 --> 23:32.955
Oh, my God.

24:00.691 --> 24:03.151
I'm not buying out points.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.696
You can offer 20 cents
on the dollar and get back to me.

24:20.836 --> 24:21.837
Kyle, what's next?

24:26.466 --> 24:28.093
Bradley Jackson's mom died.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.308
Do you want to call her?

24:37.686 --> 24:38.729
Sorry.

24:41.273 --> 24:45.194
Send her flowers,
but from the whole UBA family.

24:45.194 --> 24:46.904
- Thank you.
- Okay.

25:25.567 --> 25:29.696
There are now 102 active wildfires burning
across the West.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.406
- A federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled...
- Over four million acres...

25:31.406 --> 25:32.574
- ...that Governor Tom Wolf's...
- ...have been destroyed.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.536
...executive orders to control
the spread of the virus

25:35.536 --> 25:39.289
were unconstitutional
and a violation of individual rights.

25:49.716 --> 25:53.178
Good morning. It's Friday, September 18th.

25:53.178 --> 25:56.598
Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died. She was 87.

25:56.598 --> 26:01.436
Appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993,
she was a champion of human rights

26:01.436 --> 26:03.105
and an icon of the court.

26:03.605 --> 26:06.066
Here's a brief
retrospective of her extraordinary life.

26:21.790 --> 26:23.417
You want me to make you something else?

26:24.001 --> 26:26.003
I wanna go out to a restaurant.

26:27.004 --> 26:32.384
I wanna eat real food
and order a real drink and see people.

26:34.178 --> 26:35.262
We could sit outside.

26:36.013 --> 26:40.350
Bradley, I can't. I'm sorry.

26:51.528 --> 26:52.988
You should talk to someone.

26:54.448 --> 26:58.368
Who do you want me to talk to, Laura?
Your therapist?

26:58.368 --> 26:59.745
How about a therapist?

26:59.745 --> 27:01.997
What's a therapist
gonna fucking say to me?

27:02.497 --> 27:05.083
That it's not my fault
that my drug-addicted mother died?

27:05.083 --> 27:07.336
It's not your fault.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.713
Whatever. You hated her anyway.

27:10.422 --> 27:11.507
I never met her.

27:11.507 --> 27:12.591
You didn't have to.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.177
You hated everything she stood for.

27:15.177 --> 27:19.848
And I stopped talking to her
because I could feel it every time.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.517
That's not fair.

27:21.517 --> 27:22.809
But it's true.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.145
Oh, my God.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.818
Bradley, I am trying to support you.

27:31.818 --> 27:35.656
I'm trying to be here for you, okay?

27:35.656 --> 27:41.620
And I can't help you
if you don't try to process this.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.248
Okay, let's process it, Laura.

27:44.248 --> 27:45.707
You know what I fucking think?

27:45.707 --> 27:47.709
I think you like to dress me up,

27:47.709 --> 27:51.922
and parade me around
for your fancy fucking New York friends.

27:51.922 --> 27:54.550
- I'm like your little white trash pet.
- What?

27:54.550 --> 27:56.468
I think you don't even really like me.

27:56.468 --> 27:59.263
I think that it makes you feel better
about yourself,

27:59.263 --> 28:03.517
because you're actually an elitist snob
who hides out at the edge of the world

28:03.517 --> 28:04.935
- so she doesn't have to deal...
- Fuck you.

28:04.935 --> 28:06.937
...with real people. Fuck you.

28:06.937 --> 28:10.691
You must be so filled with spite,
it just corrodes your insides.

28:10.691 --> 28:13.402
Think you're happy
when people like my mom die,

28:13.402 --> 28:16.154
because they had-- they get COVID
'cause they're uneducated,

28:16.154 --> 28:19.449
or they're hicks, or they're just not
as fucking smart as you.

28:19.449 --> 28:20.659
You know what I think?

28:22.536 --> 28:25.873
I think there's a little part of you
that's actually relieved.

28:26.874 --> 28:28.292
You're glad she's gone.

28:29.042 --> 28:31.253
You just don't have the guts
to admit it, Bradley.

28:31.253 --> 28:33.255
And you need to grow the fuck up.

28:33.255 --> 28:36.008
You need to grow up
and stop blaming me for all your shit.

28:36.008 --> 28:39.678
You can't just dump all your stuff on me!

28:39.678 --> 28:44.099
Fucking be proactive and stop rewriting
some sort of history, Bradley.

28:44.099 --> 28:46.018
Your mother was a piece of shit.

28:46.018 --> 28:48.353
You're the first person
to tell everyone about it.

28:59.698 --> 29:00.699
Okay.

29:01.450 --> 29:05.621
It's an impossible situation,
and I don't put any of this on you.

29:05.621 --> 29:07.748
We're number two. It's on me.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.835
I should have
pulled Bradley off a month ago.

29:11.835 --> 29:13.754
She keeps asking to go on assignment.

29:13.754 --> 29:16.215
It's pretty clear that she doesn't
wanna be on <i>TMS</i>.

29:16.215 --> 29:17.299
What about Laura?

29:17.299 --> 29:19.218
At this point, they're a package deal.

29:19.718 --> 29:20.928
If Laura's on air without Bradley,

29:20.928 --> 29:22.679
that's all anyone's
gonna be thinking about.

29:22.679 --> 29:23.805
Oh, yeah.

29:24.306 --> 29:27.643
Alex is willing to come back part-time.
We can rotate guest hosts.

29:27.643 --> 29:30.020
Maybe Yanko. He's wanted this forever.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.939
We should start chasing someone now.

29:33.065 --> 29:35.484
And just so it's on the record,
I think it should be a woman of color

29:35.484 --> 29:38.445
at the teacup,
preferably someone under 40.

29:38.445 --> 29:39.738
Like Chris Hunter.

29:39.738 --> 29:43.283
Yeah, she's killing it
in her guest segments.

29:43.283 --> 29:45.744
We'll probably lose Alison
if we go that way.

29:46.578 --> 29:47.704
Yeah.

29:48.539 --> 29:52.668
Hey... there's one more thing.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.546
<i>All right, take your time.</i>

29:56.046 --> 29:58.799
<i>Anyway, you asked
what I thought I did wrong.</i>

30:01.218 --> 30:02.302
<i>I fucked up.</i>

30:02.970 --> 30:05.931
<i>Obviously.
I shouldn't have done any of it.</i>

30:08.559 --> 30:09.643
Have you seen this?

30:09.643 --> 30:13.188
- <i>I didn't want to be this person.</i>
- The Mitch Kessler interview. Wild.

30:13.814 --> 30:15.482
<i>I didn't want to hurt anyone.</i>

30:16.775 --> 30:19.528
<i>I didn't want people to think
I was the kind of person</i>

30:19.528 --> 30:21.113
<i>that could hurt someone.</i>

30:25.200 --> 30:27.953
- <i>And now one of those women is dead.</i>
- Turn it off.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.289
- Fucking douchebag.
- <i>Hannah Shoenfeld.</i>

30:31.373 --> 30:33.667
- <i>And that should have never happened--</i>
- André, turn it off.

30:33.667 --> 30:34.751
<i>That's just...</i>

30:35.794 --> 30:36.837
Sorry.

30:44.094 --> 30:45.304
Did he...

30:47.723 --> 30:48.599
No.

31:03.780 --> 31:07.618
We were together. I was in love with him.

31:09.453 --> 31:11.121
I thought he was in love with me.

31:25.719 --> 31:26.720
Say something.

31:31.475 --> 31:32.935
Why are you still there?

31:35.646 --> 31:36.813
It's my job.

31:40.776 --> 31:42.361
He's gone. I'm not.

31:43.153 --> 31:45.822
I'm still here. I'm still there.
I have people there.

31:47.199 --> 31:49.535
It may be hard to believe,
but some of us care about

31:50.035 --> 31:52.079
staying in a place,
trying to make it better.

32:05.968 --> 32:09.638
<i>Darling, you got to let me know</i>

32:11.181 --> 32:14.393
<i>Should I stay or should I go?</i>

32:16.520 --> 32:19.106
<i>If I go, there will be trouble</i>

32:24.444 --> 32:27.739
You ever tried Worcestershire sauce?
I'm gonna make a cheese toastie.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.867
- You want a cheese toastie?
- Are you drunk?

32:31.869 --> 32:32.911
Very.

32:34.079 --> 32:35.622
Did you go to a bar?

32:37.165 --> 32:39.960
No. I went to three.

33:27.049 --> 33:28.133
Asshole.

33:30.469 --> 33:31.678
Mia!

33:32.763 --> 33:34.139
If you leave this apartment--

33:34.139 --> 33:37.351
if you risk exposing anybody else
to your fucking shit,

33:37.351 --> 33:40.854
I swear to God
I will never fucking forgive you.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.064
Selfish asshole.

33:59.915 --> 34:04.211
Stella needs somebody on the ground,
right up to the certification,

34:05.254 --> 34:07.965
so I'll be in DC until January.

34:08.549 --> 34:10.259
Will you let me know that you're safe?

34:14.804 --> 34:16.431
You're not coming back, are you?

34:17.975 --> 34:19.518
Maybe it's just not our time.

34:58.515 --> 34:59.349
Hey.

34:59.349 --> 35:04.688
Hey, so AP called about an assignment.

35:05.981 --> 35:08.525
Okay. Where?

35:09.151 --> 35:12.487
Afghanistan. It could be two weeks.
It could be two months. I don't know.

35:12.487 --> 35:13.822
Are you gonna take it?

35:16.742 --> 35:18.410
I'll leave your keys with the doorman.

36:08.794 --> 36:12.256
Man. Pandemic is fucking weird.

36:13.048 --> 36:15.342
Do we dance? I think we dance.

36:15.342 --> 36:17.344
Nope. Not worth getting COVID.

36:17.344 --> 36:21.515
Fuck social distancing.
Let's go to, like, an actual club.

36:21.515 --> 36:22.975
You know, and take our chances.

36:22.975 --> 36:25.269
You don't think we're a little too old
for the underground scene?

36:25.269 --> 36:27.312
What? I am not old.

36:28.021 --> 36:30.482
- How is your dad?
- Yeah, he's actually old.

36:31.066 --> 36:33.610
You know, he still sends me
a holiday card every year?

36:33.610 --> 36:37.406
Yeah, he always liked you
because you tolerated his endless stories.

36:37.406 --> 36:40.826
He liked me because I tolerated
your intense ass for four years.

36:41.368 --> 36:43.245
Stanford was intense, not me.

36:43.245 --> 36:46.623
- I'm way less intense now. Seriously.
- I don't know.

36:46.623 --> 36:50.711
I eat real food. I sleep.
You know, sleep is my self-care.

36:50.711 --> 36:51.837
- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

36:51.837 --> 36:54.298
No more Red Bull
with Addy sprinkles for breakfast?

36:54.298 --> 36:55.382
Oh, no.

36:56.508 --> 36:59.303
You're a big, fancy newsperson now.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.388
Yeah, whatever.

37:02.806 --> 37:05.058
- How's Hyperion?
- It's okay.

37:05.559 --> 37:08.270
Kind of feels like one of those moments
where I could just pick up and leave,

37:08.270 --> 37:09.897
and no one would say shit.

37:10.606 --> 37:11.857
What would you do instead?

37:12.482 --> 37:17.529
I don't know.
Open up a café. Bomb an oil refinery.

37:18.030 --> 37:21.450
You're gonna stop programming rockets?
Come on.

37:22.034 --> 37:23.410
No, I just need a change, you know.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.204
- Any change.
- Uh-huh.

37:25.204 --> 37:26.705
Let me know if you hear of something cool.

37:26.705 --> 37:29.166
Yeah, there's nothing at UBA.
It's a hiring freeze.

37:30.125 --> 37:32.878
- I wasn't asking you for a job.
- Sorry.

37:32.878 --> 37:37.257
I'll keep my ears open.
Stuff will open up for you.

37:37.257 --> 37:38.550
Thank you.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.471
You know,
I don't blame you for what you did.

37:43.639 --> 37:46.558
Really. Leaving Paul Marks
and doing the corporate thing.

37:46.558 --> 37:47.851
I really don't.

37:48.769 --> 37:51.813
Sometimes, I wonder
what my life would have been like

37:51.813 --> 37:53.357
if I had done the same thing.

37:53.857 --> 37:54.983
Would I regret it?

37:56.109 --> 37:57.110
Yeah.

37:59.112 --> 38:00.489
My clothes would be better though.

38:04.993 --> 38:08.956
The company also examined five hours
of afternoon cable in three days.

38:08.956 --> 38:13.001
In 20-- Stella?
Stella, are you with me here? Stella?

38:13.001 --> 38:17.422
- Stella, hi. This is important. Good.
- Sorry.

38:18.924 --> 38:20.133
So how bad is it?

38:20.133 --> 38:24.263
Budgets are up 30% across the board.

38:24.263 --> 38:27.015
It is existential.

38:27.015 --> 38:28.976
- Fuck me.
- You know what?

38:28.976 --> 38:31.436
Maybe he'll refuse
to leave the White House,

38:31.436 --> 38:34.648
and the Secret Service boys will have to
drag him out by his tiny little feet,

38:34.648 --> 38:36.483
- 'cause people would watch that.
- Wait.

38:36.984 --> 38:39.653
Come on, you don't really think
that they're gonna--

38:39.653 --> 38:41.446
That there's a--

38:41.446 --> 38:45.868
an armed militia that's roving the streets
of DC ready to overturn the election?

38:45.868 --> 38:47.327
Do you have Internet?

38:48.787 --> 38:49.788
I should call Bradley.

38:51.874 --> 38:53.834
Oh, yeah. How is she doing?

38:56.170 --> 38:58.380
She says she's fine, but I don't know.

38:58.380 --> 39:01.383
And I'm starting to worry
that I shouldn't have sent her there.

39:03.010 --> 39:04.803
<i>We don't have free and fair elections.</i>

39:04.803 --> 39:08.807
<i>And you know what else?
We don't have a free and fair press.</i>

39:08.807 --> 39:11.768
<i>Our media is not free. It's not fair.</i>

39:11.768 --> 39:15.939
<i>It suppresses thought,
it suppresses speech,</i>

39:15.939 --> 39:19.026
<i>and it's become the enemy of the people.</i>

39:19.026 --> 39:21.486
<i>It's become the enemy of the people.</i>

39:22.237 --> 39:24.698
<i>It's the biggest problem we have
in this country.</i>

39:25.199 --> 39:27.034
Yeah, I'm inside.

39:27.034 --> 39:29.036
I don't know,
I got separated from my crew.

39:29.036 --> 39:32.039
I'm just gonna-- I have to go.
I'm gonna film by myself.

39:32.039 --> 39:34.499
<i>And we're gonna have to fight much harder,</i>

39:35.250 --> 39:40.756
<i>because you're sworn
to uphold our constitution.</i>

39:43.091 --> 39:48.889
<i>Now it is up to Congress to confront
this egregious assault on our democracy.</i>

39:49.389 --> 39:51.934
- <i>And after this...</i>
- Stop the steal! We're stopping the steal!

39:51.934 --> 39:54.603
- We're taking it back!
- <i>We're going to walk down--</i>

39:54.603 --> 39:57.231
- USA! USA!
- <i>We're going to walk down.</i>

39:57.231 --> 40:02.027
<i>Anyone you want, but I think right here,
we're going to walk down to the Capitol.</i>

40:04.363 --> 40:08.575
<i>And we're going to cheer on
our brave senators...</i>

40:10.035 --> 40:12.454
Fuck. Goddamn it.

40:12.454 --> 40:15.332
<i>...and we're probably not going to be
cheering so much for some of them.</i>

40:15.332 --> 40:20.003
<i>Because you'll never
take back our country with weakness.</i>

40:20.003 --> 40:22.756
<i>You have to show strength,
and you have to be strong.</i>

40:22.756 --> 40:24.466
It's a restricted area!

40:26.552 --> 40:30.472
Gonna pay now, you traitor!
What you gonna do, huh?

40:33.141 --> 40:34.309
Where you going?

40:35.519 --> 40:36.520
Let's go!

40:40.774 --> 40:41.942
Get off me!

41:24.484 --> 41:25.861
- Hey.
- Don't.

41:31.992 --> 41:33.493
What?

41:33.493 --> 41:36.079
Just say something
before I lose my mind. What, Hal?

41:36.079 --> 41:37.831
- I didn't know it was gonna be like that.
- You don't know?

41:37.831 --> 41:41.251
What the fuck are you doing here, Hal?
Why did you even come here?

41:41.251 --> 41:44.213
I had some buddies that were coming--

41:44.213 --> 41:47.257
- Those your buddies?
- I knew that you were gonna be here.

41:47.257 --> 41:48.967
I was coming to see you.

41:48.967 --> 41:51.595
We haven't seen each other in a year.

41:52.179 --> 41:56.058
You have any idea what it is like
trying to get clean on Zoom

41:56.058 --> 41:58.268
or stuck in that house
cleaning Mom's shit out?

41:58.268 --> 42:00.187
Because you weren't there.

42:00.729 --> 42:02.314
It drives you crazy.

42:02.314 --> 42:04.358
That's crazy? This is fucking crazy.

42:04.358 --> 42:07.027
I was just trying to get out of there.
All I wanted to do was leave, Brad,

42:07.027 --> 42:08.612
but then he grabbed me.

42:08.612 --> 42:11.740
You assaulted a police officer.
That is a felony, Hal.

42:11.740 --> 42:14.660
And I caught you doing it
on fucking camera.

42:19.164 --> 42:22.793
Cheryl's pregnant. I'm gonna be a dad.

42:24.044 --> 42:26.713
What? What did you say?

42:26.713 --> 42:29.091
Cheryl's pregnant. I'm gonna be a dad.
She's gonna have a baby.

42:29.091 --> 42:31.343
- I'm gonna have a baby.
- Oh, my God.

42:31.343 --> 42:33.971
What do I do? You have to help me.

42:33.971 --> 42:37.432
- What am I supposed to do?
- Oh, my God.

42:39.810 --> 42:41.144
Okay.

42:47.109 --> 42:48.110
Okay, let me think.

42:49.027 --> 42:50.863
Wait, who knows you were here?

42:51.488 --> 42:53.282
Where did you tell Cheryl you were going?

42:54.491 --> 42:55.784
She thinks I went camping.

42:55.784 --> 42:58.787
Okay. You have to get out of here.

42:58.787 --> 43:01.331
You're gonna take a bus,

43:01.331 --> 43:02.875
- and you were never here.
- Brad.

43:02.875 --> 43:04.668
- And I never fucking saw you.
- Brad.

43:04.668 --> 43:07.421
Give me your phone.
Have to get rid of your phone.

43:10.382 --> 43:13.385
And you have to go! Right now.

43:16.180 --> 43:19.057
- Thank you.
- Goddamn it, Hal, just get out of here.

43:20.559 --> 43:24.605
And, Hal, don't call me.
And don't text me.

43:25.898 --> 43:27.441
Do you understand?

44:36.218 --> 44:39.096
<i>Stop the steal! Stop the steal!</i>

44:44.893 --> 44:46.395
This is incredible.

44:51.108 --> 44:52.526
I want <i>Evening News</i>.

44:54.152 --> 44:57.781
<i>At 12:53 p.m.,
the outer perimeter is breached.</i>

44:57.781 --> 44:59.992
As the vaccine hits your system
you may experience

44:59.992 --> 45:01.618
dizziness, confusion, fever.

45:01.618 --> 45:04.037
<i>A crowd infiltrates the Capitol</i>

45:04.037 --> 45:07.749
<i>and engages in a standoff
outside the Senate Chamber.</i>

45:07.749 --> 45:10.294
Your immune system is gonna
detect the foreign mRNA,

45:10.294 --> 45:13.338
and it's going to marshal all its
resources it can to combat it.

45:13.338 --> 45:16.049
<i>Violence erupts almost immediately,</i>

45:16.049 --> 45:18.719
<i>as staffers barricade themselves
in offices.</i>

45:18.719 --> 45:22.306
You're likely to be exhausted,
dissociated even, for a few days.

45:22.306 --> 45:27.936
<i>Imagine, complete chaos within
the walls of this monument to democracy.</i>

45:29.521 --> 45:33.942
Stop the steal. Stop the steal!
Stop the steal! Stop the steal!

45:33.942 --> 45:34.985
<i>USA!</i>

45:35.736 --> 45:37.446
Stop the steal!

45:37.446 --> 45:39.615
Reach out to my office
to set up your second shot.

45:39.615 --> 45:40.741
Congratulations.

45:40.741 --> 45:44.328
No one knows where to go or what to do.

46:01.512 --> 46:03.388
You ever worry about sharks?

46:04.806 --> 46:07.059
Yeah, I don't bother them,
they don't bother me.

46:07.643 --> 46:10.479
400 million years.
That's how long they've been here.

46:11.355 --> 46:12.356
I don't know.

46:12.981 --> 46:16.026
There were sharks in that ocean
before there were rings around Saturn.

46:16.026 --> 46:18.362
Humans, we're just a blip.

46:18.362 --> 46:21.865
Showed up yesterday,
almost certainly be gone tomorrow.

46:21.865 --> 46:24.117
All we have is today. My money is on them.

46:25.035 --> 46:27.329
- You live around here?
- Yeah, I just bought a place.

46:27.329 --> 46:30.624
I figure I got 50 years
before the ocean swallows it up.

46:32.209 --> 46:33.460
Should have bought a boat.

46:33.460 --> 46:37.172
Well, you know, I tried to build an ark,
but supply chain.

46:38.173 --> 46:40.300
Paul Marks. And you are?

46:40.300 --> 46:41.677
I'm Cory Ellison.

46:42.678 --> 46:45.806
Right. UBA, right? Yeah.

46:45.806 --> 46:50.435
Exactly. Have you ever thought about
getting into media?

46:51.270 --> 46:52.437
I hate television.

46:53.438 --> 46:55.357
Boy, you'd fit right in.

46:58.110 --> 47:00.863
Nice to meet you, Cory. See you around.

47:12.541 --> 47:14.126
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

47:20.215 --> 47:21.216
Wow.

47:24.678 --> 47:27.681
- You want some water or--
- No. I'm good.

47:27.681 --> 47:31.310
I-- Wow,
is this how you spent your pandemic?

47:32.352 --> 47:33.687
Something like that.

47:34.229 --> 47:37.441
- Wow. It's beautiful.
- Thanks.

47:45.782 --> 47:47.784
This mask is driving me crazy.

47:48.410 --> 47:51.413
So, I'm assuming you got a copy of
the subpoena today?

47:51.413 --> 47:52.956
That made my week.

47:52.956 --> 47:56.251
I mean, don't you love getting mail
from the FBI?

47:56.251 --> 47:57.836
It's so polite. It's so civilized.

47:57.836 --> 48:00.797
It's a hell of a lot better than
when they kick in your door at 4:00 a.m.

48:00.797 --> 48:02.090
and drag you out by the pj's.

48:02.090 --> 48:05.511
Yeah, Cory, we have to protect
our journalistic independence.

48:07.012 --> 48:08.013
Okay, yeah.

48:08.889 --> 48:11.016
Normally I would
totally agree with you on that,

48:11.016 --> 48:13.185
- but this is a-- Not in this case.
- Cory.

48:13.185 --> 48:16.480
I spoke with the special agent in charge.

48:17.397 --> 48:19.233
There was a police officer
who was assaulted

48:19.233 --> 48:20.651
in the hallway of the Capitol.

48:21.151 --> 48:22.694
No witnesses, no video.

48:22.694 --> 48:24.530
And based upon your reporting,

48:24.530 --> 48:26.281
they think you were nearby
when it happened,

48:26.281 --> 48:29.284
and there might be something useful
on your footage.

48:29.284 --> 48:32.162
Hey, you could be a hero.
Hell, I might even be a hero,

48:32.162 --> 48:36.542
supporting the great cause of democracy,
et cetera, et cetera.

48:36.542 --> 48:41.713
I know you have principles,
but this is an extraordinary situation.

48:46.218 --> 48:47.469
I deleted the footage.

48:49.972 --> 48:53.600
And they're gonna know,
'cause the footage cuts out in the hallway

48:54.893 --> 48:58.355
right as the police officer
comes out of the door. And--

48:59.857 --> 49:01.942
Because?

49:04.319 --> 49:06.363
Hal is on it.

49:08.782 --> 49:12.703
Hal was at the Capitol?

49:13.704 --> 49:15.789
And they're gonna see the footage, Cory.

49:17.124 --> 49:18.917
And they're gonna know what I did.

49:18.917 --> 49:22.171
And they're gonna wanna talk to me.

49:31.680 --> 49:33.557
Bradley, we put you on <i>Evening News</i>.

49:34.183 --> 49:35.350
Do you understand?

49:35.976 --> 49:40.814
This jeopardizes the entire network.

49:40.814 --> 49:42.065
I know.

49:43.734 --> 49:44.735
I'm sorry.

49:46.278 --> 49:47.779
I'm really sorry. I--

49:50.908 --> 49:52.618
Hal's the only person I have left.

49:54.578 --> 49:56.413
And he says he didn't want
to hurt anybody,

49:56.413 --> 49:58.957
and I didn't know what to do.

50:15.307 --> 50:17.601
I'll have our lawyers
reach out to the FBI,

50:17.601 --> 50:19.102
and the Feds can have the--

50:22.731 --> 50:25.234
the video that was already aired
and that's it.

50:28.487 --> 50:30.656
Journalistic independence, as you say.

50:30.656 --> 50:31.949
Thank you.

50:33.492 --> 50:34.493
I just--

50:35.619 --> 50:37.287
I'd like for you to leave now.

50:45.963 --> 50:49.675
And I don't wanna hear
another fucking word about this, ever.

51:04.022 --> 51:05.274
You ready?

51:06.024 --> 51:07.150
Yeah.

51:40.517 --> 51:41.643
<i>Have a good show.</i>

51:58.702 --> 51:59.703
Thank you.

52:00.954 --> 52:02.039
Sound check.

52:04.082 --> 52:05.083
Great.

52:06.418 --> 52:10.714
Five, four, three, two...

52:15.093 --> 52:16.136
Good evening.

52:16.136 --> 52:20.140
I'm Bradley Jackson,
and this is the <i>UBA Evening News</i>.
