04:28.977 --> 04:30.020
Sequence.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.316
Well, my dear...

04:34.608 --> 04:37.569
So how are you adapting
to the world outside?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.237
Very well, I think.

04:39.404 --> 04:44.117
I've advised her to watch and learn
and be quiet except when spoken to.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.873
So we must see what we can devise
for your amusement.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.134
Valmont is here.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.637
You receive him, do you?

05:04.679 --> 05:06.139
Yes.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.891
So do you.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.397
Monsieur le Vicomte de Valmont,
my child...

05:14.522 --> 05:16.483
...whom you very probably
don't remember...

05:16.608 --> 05:19.027
...except that he is
conspicuously charming...

05:19.152 --> 05:23.198
...never opens his mouth without first
calculating what damage he can do.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.700
Then why do you receive him,
maman?

05:26.034 --> 05:28.078
Everyone receives him.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.554
Madame.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.598
What a pleasant surprise.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.976
Madame de Volanges.
How delightful to see you.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.980
You remember my daughter, Cécile?

05:56.064 --> 06:00.110
Well, indeed, but who could have
foretold she would flower so gracefully?

06:02.070 --> 06:04.906
I wanted to call on you
before leaving the city.

06:05.073 --> 06:05.949
Oh...

06:06.282 --> 06:09.285
I'm not sure we can allow that.
Why should you want to leave?

06:09.411 --> 06:11.204
Paris in August, you know...

06:11.287 --> 06:13.415
...and it's time I paid a visit on my aunt.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.625
I've neglected her disgracefully.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.293
Madame de Rosemonde
has been good enough...

06:17.419 --> 06:19.796
...to invite us to stay at the château.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.715
Won't you please give her
our warmest regards?

06:22.882 --> 06:25.135
I shall make a point of it, Madame.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.139
I think it's time we took you home.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.934
I'm used to being in bed
by nine at the convent.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.602
So I should hope.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.414
Your aunt?

06:54.664 --> 06:55.915
That's correct.

06:56.207 --> 07:00.086
I thought she'd already made
arrangements to leave you all her money.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.468
Do you know why I summoned you
here this evening?

07:07.594 --> 07:10.180
I'd hoped it might be for
the pleasure of my company.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.764
I need you...

07:11.890 --> 07:14.309
...to carry out an heroic enterprise.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.396
You remember when Bastide left me?

07:18.605 --> 07:19.355
Yes.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.483
And went off with that fat mistress
of yours whose name escapes me.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.735
Yes, yes.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.988
No one has ever done that to me before.
Or to you, I suspect.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.616
I was quite relieved to be rid of her,
frankly.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.117
No, you weren't.

07:33.995 --> 07:37.790
For some years now,
Bastide has been searching for a wife.

07:37.957 --> 07:42.587
He was always unshakably prejudiced
in favour of convent education.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.089
And now he's found the ideal candidate.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.052
Cécile Volanges.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.720
Very good.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.642
And her 60,000 a year.

07:55.767 --> 07:59.604
That must have played some small part
in Bastide's calculations.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.689
None whatsoever.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.609
Bastide's priority, you see...

08:04.734 --> 08:07.111
... is a guaranteed virtue.

08:08.154 --> 08:12.617
I wonder if I'm beginning to guess
what it is you're intending to propose.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.665
Bastide is with his regiment in Corsica
for the rest of the year.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.000
That should give you plenty of time.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.879
You mean to...?

08:26.714 --> 08:28.925
- She's a rosebud.
- You think so?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.843
And he'd get back from his honeymoon...

08:30.927 --> 08:33.388
...to find himself the laughing stock
of Paris.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.640
- Well...
- Yes.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.811
Love and revenge. Two of your favourites.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.816
No, I can't.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.693
What?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.403
Oh really, I can't.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.905
- Why not?
- Oh, it's too easy.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.492
It is.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.868
She's seen nothing.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.913
She knows nothing.
She's bound to be curious.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.415
She'd be on her back...

09:00.540 --> 09:03.543
...before you'd unwrapped
the first bunch of flowers.

09:04.836 --> 09:07.588
Any one of a dozen men could manage it.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.216
I have my reputation to think of.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.686
I can see I'm going to have
to tell you everything.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.521
- Of course you are.
- Yes.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.442
My aunt is not on her own
just at the moment.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.986
She has a young friend staying with her.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.322
Madame de Tourvel.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.202
You can't mean it.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.957
To seduce a woman famous
for strict morals...

09:43.082 --> 09:46.335
...religious fervour and the happiness
of her marriage...

09:46.461 --> 09:49.213
What could possibly be more prestigious?

09:49.380 --> 09:53.384
I think there's something degrading
about having a husband for a rival.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.263
It's humiliating if you fail,
and commonplace if you succeed.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.099
Where is Monsieur de Tourvel anyway?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.643
Presiding over some
endless case in Burgundy.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.188
I don't think you can hope
for any actual pleasure.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.439
Oh, yes.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.776
You see, I have no intention
of breaking down her prejudices.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.906
I want her to believe in God and virtue
and the sanctity of marriage...

10:14.989 --> 10:17.450
...and still not be able to stop herself.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.288
I want the excitement of watching her...

10:22.371 --> 10:25.374
...betray everything that's
most important to her.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.543
Surely you understand that.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.837
I thought "betrayal"
was your favourite word.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.589
No, no...

10:32.423 --> 10:33.883
..."cruelty. "

10:35.134 --> 10:38.221
I always think that has a nobler ring to it.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.106
- How is Belleroche?
- I'm very pleased with him.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.484
And is he your only lover?

10:53.861 --> 10:54.946
Yes.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.114
I think you should take another.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.659
I think it most unhealthy, this exclusivity.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.910
You're not jealous, are you?

11:01.035 --> 11:03.579
Of course I am.
Belleroche is completely undeserving.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.665
I thought he was one
of your closest friends.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.501
Exactly, so I know what I'm talking about.

11:12.546 --> 11:15.967
No,
I think you should organise an infidelity.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.219
With me, for example.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.226
You refuse me a simple favour...

11:25.309 --> 11:27.269
...then you expect to be indulged?

11:27.353 --> 11:31.190
It's only because it is so simple.
It wouldn't feel like a conquest.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.818
I have to follow my destiny.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.569
I have to be true...

11:36.487 --> 11:38.072
...to my profession.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.579
All right then.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.834
Come back when you've succeeded
with Madame de Tourvel.

11:51.127 --> 11:51.961
Yes.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.255
And I will offer you...

11:55.172 --> 11:56.507
...a reward.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.092
My love.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.137
But I shall require proof.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.722
Certainly.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.890
Written proof.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.812
Not negotiable.

12:16.944 --> 12:20.865
I don't suppose there's
any possibility of an advance?

12:24.618 --> 12:26.829
Goodnight, Vicomte.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.852
Where have you been?

12:53.063 --> 12:55.524
Time has no logic when I'm not with you.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.568
An hour is like a century.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.906
I've told you before,
we shall get on a great deal better...

13:01.989 --> 13:06.327
...if you make a concerted effort
not to sound like the latest novel.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.554
It's such a beautiful day,
I believe we'll walk.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.144
You didn't take the sacrament today.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.187
No.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.314
May I ask why?

14:18.857 --> 14:22.778
I have this appalling reputation,
as you may know.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.072
Yes, I have been warned about you.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.116
You have? By whom?

14:28.742 --> 14:30.285
A friend.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.751
The fact is I've spent my life
surrounded by immoral people.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.295
I've allowed myself
to be influenced by them...

14:40.379 --> 14:43.632
...and sometimes even taken pride
in outshining them.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.592
- And now?
- Now...

14:45.884 --> 14:49.138
...what I most often feel is unworthiness.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.976
But it is precisely at such moments
that you start to become worthy.

14:59.314 --> 15:04.028
I certainly believe one should
constantly strive to improve oneself.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.812
Chevalier...

16:21.939 --> 16:24.858
...I don't believe you know my cousin,
Madame de Volanges.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.485
This is Chevalier Danceny.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.946
And Madame's daughter, Cécile.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.699
Tell us what we should think of the opera.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.661
It's sublime, don't you find?

16:37.037 --> 16:39.373
Monsieur Danceny is one
of those rare eccentrics...

16:39.456 --> 16:42.042
...who come here to listen to the music.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.715
I do look forward to our next meeting.

16:57.432 --> 16:59.351
Charming young man...

16:59.434 --> 17:01.228
...penniless, regrettably.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.398
He's one of the finest
music teachers in the city.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.319
Perhaps you should employ him.

17:51.903 --> 17:54.823
How are you getting on
with Madame de Tourvel's maid?

17:54.906 --> 17:57.409
Julie, to tell you the truth, sir,
it's been a bit boring.

17:57.492 --> 17:59.786
If I wasn't so anxious to keep
Your Lordship abreast...

17:59.870 --> 18:01.288
...I think I'd have only bothered the once.

18:01.371 --> 18:04.374
Still, what else is there to do
in the country?

18:04.708 --> 18:08.545
It wasn't so much the details
of your intimacy I was after...

18:08.628 --> 18:12.799
...it's whether or not she's agreed
to bring me Madame de Tourvel's letters.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.343
- She won't steal the letters, sir.
- She won't?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.511
You know better than me, sir.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.597
It's easy enough making them do
what they want to do.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.515
It's trying to get them to do
what you want them to do...

18:20.599 --> 18:21.767
...that gives you a headache.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.393
And them, as often as not.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.520
I need to know who's
writing to her about me.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.814
I shouldn't worry if I was you, sir.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.651
She told Julie she didn't believe
you went hunting in the mornings.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.362
She said she was going
to have you followed.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.365
So I'd say it was only a matter of time.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.545
That is a terrible noise he's making.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.964
He should get the news back
to her twice as quickly.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.967
I don't think we should make it
too easy for him.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.821
What exactly do you think you're doing?

19:15.904 --> 19:18.156
I am impounding these effects, sir.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.785
Has it not been explained to you?
Monsieur Armand is not well.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.955
I don't make the laws, sir.
I just do what I'm told.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.706
Everybody has to pay his taxes.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.333
How much does he owe?

19:29.209 --> 19:30.335
How much?

19:30.710 --> 19:31.795
Fifty-six
livres.

19:31.878 --> 19:33.672
- Pay him.
- Yes, my lord.

19:42.430 --> 19:43.932
Monsieur Armand...

19:44.641 --> 19:46.226
Excuse me, you don't know me.

19:46.309 --> 19:48.728
Of course I do, Monsieur le Vicomte.

19:48.812 --> 19:49.980
Please, don't get up.

19:50.063 --> 19:53.149
- I have to. They're taking the bed.
- No, not at all.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.902
No one's taking anything.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.426
Just to tide you over. I insist.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.013
Me, sir...

20:23.471 --> 20:26.474
Fifty-six livres to save
an entire family from ruin.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.059
That seems a genuine bargain.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.228
These days, my lord,
you can find half a dozen like that...

20:30.312 --> 20:31.813
...in any village in the country.

20:31.896 --> 20:33.356
Really?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.608
I must say the family was
very well chosen.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.277
Solidly respectable...

20:37.485 --> 20:41.281
...gratifyingly tearful,
no suspiciously pretty girls. Well done.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.991
I do my best for you, sir.

20:43.074 --> 20:45.201
And all that humble gratitude.
It was most affecting.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.370
Certainly brought a tear to my eye.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.164
That's from her husband.

20:53.835 --> 20:57.839
This must be from
that officious friend of hers.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.222
Tell me, where do you and Julie meet?

21:06.306 --> 21:07.682
In my room, sir.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.894
- And is she coming tonight?
- Afraid so.

21:11.561 --> 21:14.064
I think I may be forced to burst in on you.

21:14.147 --> 21:17.233
See if blackmail will succeed
any better than bribery.

21:17.358 --> 21:18.943
About two o'clock suit you?

21:19.027 --> 21:22.197
I don't want to embarrass you.
Will that give you enough time?

21:22.280 --> 21:23.948
Ample, sir.

21:27.869 --> 21:31.372
Is this true about Monsieur Armand?

21:32.499 --> 21:34.459
I don't believe I know anyone
of that name.

21:34.542 --> 21:36.002
You may as well own up, Monsieur.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.504
My footman happened to be passing...

21:37.587 --> 21:40.006
...when you were in the village
this morning.

21:40.090 --> 21:43.593
I don't think you should pay too much
attention to servants' gossip.

21:43.676 --> 21:45.720
It is true, isn't it?

21:48.056 --> 21:49.224
Well...

21:49.808 --> 21:50.809
...yes.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.060
It is.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.980
You dear boy,
come and let me give you a hug.

22:24.175 --> 22:27.428
I can't understand how someone
whose instincts are so generous...

22:27.512 --> 22:29.764
...could lead such a dissolute life.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.226
I'm afraid you have an exaggerated idea...

22:33.351 --> 22:36.604
...both of my generosity
and of my depravity.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.024
If I knew who'd given you
such a dire account of me...

22:43.653 --> 22:45.071
Since I don't...

22:46.698 --> 22:48.825
...let me make a confession.

22:49.033 --> 22:53.204
I'm afraid the key to the paradox lies
in a certain weakness of character.

22:54.289 --> 22:58.626
I can't see how so thoughtful an act
of charity could be described as weak.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.503
Because it was simply a response...

23:00.587 --> 23:03.089
...to a strong new influence in my life.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.299
Yours.

23:13.349 --> 23:15.476
You see how weak I am?

23:15.977 --> 23:19.397
I promised myself
I was never going to tell you.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.649
It's just that looking at you...

23:21.941 --> 23:23.359
You needn't worry...

23:23.443 --> 23:25.069
...I have no illicit intentions.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.864
I would not dream of insulting you.

23:31.451 --> 23:32.952
But I do love you.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.747
I adore you.

23:37.665 --> 23:39.751
Please, help me.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.768
- I rang a number of times.
- Didn't hear, sir.

24:38.851 --> 24:41.813
- I require some hot water.
- Right away, sir.

24:42.313 --> 24:43.856
Don't move.

24:48.903 --> 24:50.196
- Azolan...
- Sir?

24:50.279 --> 24:52.198
Wait for me in my room.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.328
You know I can't condone
this sort of behaviour, Julie.

24:57.411 --> 24:58.538
I know, sir.

24:58.621 --> 25:01.499
- But, you may rely on my discretion.
- Thank you, sir.

25:01.582 --> 25:04.836
Providing, of course,
that you agree to my price.

25:16.597 --> 25:18.975
No. Nothing like that.

25:19.976 --> 25:22.270
No, all I want is to get
to see every letter...

25:22.353 --> 25:25.481
...that Madame de Tourvel
has received since her arrival here...

25:25.565 --> 25:27.692
...and every letter that she writes
from now on.

25:27.775 --> 25:28.943
But sir, I can't-

25:29.026 --> 25:31.654
Deliver them to Azolan
by midnight tomorrow.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.075
For your trouble.

26:41.932 --> 26:45.645
Would it be very wrong of me
to answer Monsieur Danceny's letters?

26:45.728 --> 26:49.023
- In the circumstances, yes.
- In what circumstances?

26:49.106 --> 26:51.734
It's not my place to
tell you this, my dear...

26:51.817 --> 26:54.153
...if I hadn't become so fond of you...

26:54.236 --> 26:55.488
Go on, please.

26:55.613 --> 26:57.698
Your marriage has been arranged.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.868
- Who is it?
- Oh, someone I know slightly.

27:00.951 --> 27:02.578
Monsieur le Comte de Bastide.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.413
- What's he like?
- Well...

27:04.538 --> 27:05.581
You don't like him?

27:05.665 --> 27:08.751
Oh, it's not that. He's a man
of somewhat erratic judgement.

27:08.834 --> 27:10.795
- And rather serious.
- How old is he?

27:10.878 --> 27:14.840
- Thirty-six.
- Thirty-six! He's an old man.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.968
Do you know when?

27:18.219 --> 27:20.596
In the new year, I believe.

27:21.972 --> 27:25.226
Maybe there's a way to let you
write to Monsieur Danceny.

27:25.309 --> 27:27.061
Oh, Madame.

27:30.481 --> 27:33.984
If you were to let me see both sides
of the correspondence...

27:34.068 --> 27:35.903
...I could reassure myself.

27:36.070 --> 27:39.365
But I can't show the letters
I've already sent him.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.850
I trust you slept well, Madame.
I wish I could say that I had.

28:05.933 --> 28:08.894
I thought the least I could hope for
was that you would respect me.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.146
But I do, of course I do!

28:10.229 --> 28:12.231
You've offended me deeply.
It's unforgivable.

28:12.314 --> 28:15.526
This confirms everything
I've been told about you.

28:16.694 --> 28:19.405
I'm beginning to think you may
have planned the whole exercise.

28:19.488 --> 28:21.740
I had no idea you were staying here.

28:21.824 --> 28:25.244
Not that it would have disturbed me
in the slightest if I had known.

28:25.327 --> 28:29.290
You see, until I met you,
I had only ever experienced desire.

28:29.373 --> 28:31.458
Love, never.

28:31.542 --> 28:33.294
- That's enough.
- No, no...

28:33.460 --> 28:34.753
...you've made an accusation.

28:34.837 --> 28:37.631
You must allow me the opportunity
to defend myself.

28:37.715 --> 28:40.426
I'm not going to deny
that I was aware of your beauty...

28:40.509 --> 28:44.013
...but the point is,
this has nothing to do with your beauty.

28:44.430 --> 28:46.515
As I got to know you, I began to realise...

28:46.599 --> 28:49.310
...that beauty was the least
of your qualities.

28:49.393 --> 28:51.687
I became fascinated by your goodness.

28:51.770 --> 28:53.147
I was drawn in by it.

28:53.230 --> 28:55.858
I didn't understand
what was happening to me.

28:55.941 --> 28:59.320
It was only when I began to feel
actual physical pain...

28:59.403 --> 29:01.071
...every time you left the room...

29:01.155 --> 29:03.908
...that it finally dawned on me.
I was in love.

29:06.619 --> 29:08.037
...but that didn't matter to me.

29:08.120 --> 29:11.749
It's not that I want to have you,
all I want is to deserve you.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.127
Tell me what to do.

29:15.210 --> 29:18.047
Show me how to behave.
I'll do anything you say.

29:19.715 --> 29:23.093
Very well, then.
I would like you to leave this house.

29:25.721 --> 29:27.848
I don't see why that should be necessary.

29:27.932 --> 29:31.268
Let's just say you've spent
your whole life making it necessary.

29:31.352 --> 29:34.438
And if you refuse,
I shall be forced to leave myself.

29:34.855 --> 29:37.566
Well then, of course, whatever you say.

29:38.025 --> 29:39.652
Thank you.

29:45.866 --> 29:49.620
Perhaps I might be so bold
as to ask a favour in return?

29:50.079 --> 29:52.289
I think it would only be
just to let me know...

29:52.373 --> 29:54.500
...which of your friends
has blackened my name.

29:54.583 --> 29:56.585
If friends of mine have warned me
against you...

29:56.669 --> 29:59.088
...I could hardly reward them
with betrayal.

29:59.171 --> 30:01.298
I must say,
you devalue your generous offer...

30:01.382 --> 30:03.175
...if you want to use it
as a bargaining point.

30:03.258 --> 30:05.135
Very well, I withdraw the request.

30:05.219 --> 30:08.722
I hope you won't think I'm bargaining
if I ask you to let me write to you.

30:08.806 --> 30:10.349
- Well-
- And pray that you will do me...

30:10.432 --> 30:12.184
...the kindness of answering my letters.

30:12.267 --> 30:14.103
I'm not sure a correspondence with you...

30:14.186 --> 30:16.063
...is something a woman of honour
could permit herself.

30:16.146 --> 30:18.816
You're determined to refuse
my suggestions, however respectable.

30:18.899 --> 30:21.276
- I didn't say that.
- And you'd rather be unjust...

30:21.360 --> 30:23.445
...than risk showing me
a touch of kindness?

30:23.529 --> 30:25.197
I would welcome the chance
to prove to you...

30:25.280 --> 30:28.992
...that what lies behind this
is not hatred or resentment but-

30:29.118 --> 30:30.619
But what?

30:59.940 --> 31:01.483
Listen to this:

31:01.775 --> 31:05.487
"He knows exactly how far
he may venture without risk...

31:05.571 --> 31:07.573
"... and guarantees his own security...

31:07.656 --> 31:11.994
"... by tormenting only the safest kind
of victim: women. "

31:18.083 --> 31:20.586
Madame de Volanges...

31:25.799 --> 31:28.760
- Goodbye, Aunt.
- Goodbye, dear boy.

31:34.474 --> 31:36.852
- Monsieur, please...
- I'll write soon.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.833
My dear Madame de Tourvel...

32:02.669 --> 32:04.338
...I have just come...

32:05.005 --> 32:07.132
Don't move, I said. -

32:09.760 --> 32:12.262
...to my desk...

32:14.973 --> 32:17.476
...in the middle of a stormy night...

32:18.894 --> 32:20.562
...during which...

32:21.605 --> 32:24.232
...I have been...

32:25.192 --> 32:26.818
...tossed...

32:27.402 --> 32:30.280
... from exultation...

32:31.406 --> 32:34.201
... to exhaustion...

32:34.576 --> 32:36.703
... and back again.

32:37.454 --> 32:40.040
Y et, despite these torments...

32:41.708 --> 32:44.086
... I guarantee that at this moment...

32:44.169 --> 32:47.172
... I am far happier than you.

32:55.681 --> 32:59.101
We'll finish it later, shall we?

33:05.857 --> 33:07.734
Your damned cousin, the Volanges bitch...

33:07.818 --> 33:09.820
...wanted me away
from Madame de Tourvel.

33:09.903 --> 33:13.240
Well, now I am and I intend
to make her suffer for it.

33:13.365 --> 33:18.328
Your plan, to ruin her daughter,
are you making any progress?

33:20.330 --> 33:22.874
Is there anything I can do to help?

33:22.958 --> 33:25.252
I'm entirely at your disposal.

33:27.379 --> 33:28.422
Well...

33:29.047 --> 33:30.048
...yes.

33:31.091 --> 33:34.678
I told Danceny you would act
as his confidant and advisor.

33:35.387 --> 33:38.849
I need you to stiffen his resolve,
if that's the phrase.

33:40.976 --> 33:42.644
I thought if anyone could help him-

33:42.728 --> 33:45.605
Help? He doesn't need help,
he needs hindrances.

33:45.689 --> 33:47.566
If he has to climb over enough of them...

33:47.649 --> 33:50.652
...he might inadvertently
fall on top of her.

33:50.861 --> 33:53.405
I take it he hasn't been a great success.

33:53.530 --> 33:55.323
He's been disastrous.

33:55.407 --> 33:58.285
Like most intellectuals,
he's intensely stupid.

34:02.038 --> 34:05.792
I often wonder how you managed
to invent yourself.

34:06.668 --> 34:09.420
I had no choice, did I? I'm a woman.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.842
Women are obliged to be
far more skillful than men.

34:14.426 --> 34:18.513
You can ruin our reputation and our life
with a few well-chosen words.

34:18.597 --> 34:21.475
So, of course,
I had to invent not only myself...

34:21.725 --> 34:25.520
...but ways of escape
no one has ever thought of before.

34:26.521 --> 34:28.773
And I've succeeded because...

34:29.190 --> 34:34.404
...I've always known I was born
to dominate your sex and avenge my own.

34:36.572 --> 34:39.284
Yes, but what I ask was, how?

34:45.540 --> 34:49.043
When I came out into society I was 15.

34:49.668 --> 34:53.130
I already knew that the role
I was condemned to...

34:53.340 --> 34:56.134
...namely, to keep quiet
and do what I was told...

34:56.217 --> 35:00.013
...gave me the perfect
opportunity to listen and observe.

35:00.472 --> 35:04.100
Not to what people told me,
which naturally was of no interest...

35:04.643 --> 35:08.063
...but to whatever it was
they were trying to hide.

35:08.647 --> 35:11.191
I practised detachment.

35:11.775 --> 35:14.069
I learnt how to look cheerful
while under the table...

35:14.152 --> 35:16.821
...I stuck a fork into the back of my hand.

35:18.490 --> 35:20.242
I became...

35:20.492 --> 35:23.328
...a virtuoso of deceit.

35:23.536 --> 35:26.623
It wasn't pleasure I was after,
it was knowledge.

35:27.415 --> 35:31.211
I consulted the strictest moralist
to learn how to appear.

35:31.419 --> 35:33.755
Philosophers, to find out what to think.

35:33.838 --> 35:37.175
And novelists,
to see what I could get away with.

35:37.509 --> 35:42.806
And in the end I distilled everything
to one wonderfully simple principle...

35:44.099 --> 35:46.643
...win or die.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.605
So, you're infallible, are you?

35:51.856 --> 35:54.067
If I want a man, I have him.

35:54.317 --> 35:57.404
If he wants to tell, he finds that he can't.

35:59.447 --> 36:01.783
That's the whole story.

36:02.158 --> 36:03.994
And was that our story?

36:08.957 --> 36:11.584
I wanted you before we'd ever met.

36:12.210 --> 36:14.546
My self-esteem demanded it.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.299
Then when you began to pursue me...

36:19.009 --> 36:21.219
...I wanted you so badly.

36:22.721 --> 36:27.642
It's the only time I have ever been
controlled by my desire.

36:29.561 --> 36:31.938
Single combat.

36:53.752 --> 36:55.962
Madame de Volanges...

37:05.597 --> 37:07.515
Your note said it was urgent.

37:07.974 --> 37:11.227
It's days now. I haven't been able
to think of anything else.

37:11.311 --> 37:15.398
Please, sit down.
I have reason to believe...

37:16.065 --> 37:19.068
...that a... how should I describe it...

37:20.111 --> 37:24.908
...that a dangerous liaison
has sprung up between your daughter...

37:25.158 --> 37:27.118
...and the Chevalier Danceny.

37:27.535 --> 37:31.080
Oh, no, that's completely absurd.

37:31.372 --> 37:35.043
Cécile is still a child.
She understands nothing of these things.

37:35.585 --> 37:39.422
And Danceny is an entirely
respectable young man.

37:40.131 --> 37:41.508
Tell me...

37:41.716 --> 37:44.552
...does Cécile have a great
many correspondents?

37:44.719 --> 37:46.012
Why do you ask?

37:46.137 --> 37:48.598
I went to her room
at the beginning of this week.

37:48.681 --> 37:50.934
I simply knocked on the door and entered.

37:51.017 --> 37:52.435
She was stuffing an envelope...

37:52.519 --> 37:55.438
...into the top right-hand drawer
of her bureau...

37:55.605 --> 37:57.398
...in which I couldn't help noticing...

37:57.482 --> 38:00.652
...there seemed to be a large number
of similar letters.

38:04.781 --> 38:07.158
I am most grateful to you.

38:11.162 --> 38:14.165
Would you think it impertinent
if I were to make another suggestion?

38:14.249 --> 38:16.000
No, no.

38:16.084 --> 38:17.919
If my recollection is correct...

38:18.002 --> 38:20.672
...I overheard you saying
to the Vicomte de Valmont...

38:20.755 --> 38:24.259
...that his aunt invited you and Cécile
to stay at her château.

38:24.342 --> 38:26.094
She has, yes, repeatedly.

38:31.099 --> 38:34.769
A spell in the country
might be the very thing.

38:40.441 --> 38:42.443
Thank you.

38:51.786 --> 38:54.122
You asked for hindrances.

38:54.372 --> 38:57.625
You are a genuinely wicked woman.

38:57.917 --> 39:00.211
And you wanted a chance
to make my cousin suffer.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.421
I can't resist you.

39:01.504 --> 39:02.964
I made it easy for you.

39:03.047 --> 39:06.634
But, all this is most inconvenient.

39:08.177 --> 39:11.889
The Comtesse de Beaulieu
has invited me to stay.

39:12.056 --> 39:14.559
Well, you will just have to put her off.

39:14.809 --> 39:18.521
Well, the Comtesse has promised me
extensive use of her gardens.

39:18.896 --> 39:22.859
It seems her husband's fingers are
not as green as they once were.

39:23.276 --> 39:24.444
Maybe not.

39:24.652 --> 39:27.739
But from what I hear,
all his friends are gardeners.

39:27.822 --> 39:29.407
Is that so?

39:29.824 --> 39:32.118
You want your revenge, I want my revenge.

39:32.201 --> 39:34.620
I'm afraid there's only
one place you can go.

39:34.704 --> 39:36.080
Back to Auntie?

39:36.622 --> 39:38.166
Back to Auntie.

39:38.249 --> 39:41.085
Where you can also pursue
that other matter.

39:42.003 --> 39:44.839
You have some evidence to procure,
have you not?

39:50.303 --> 39:52.847
Don't you think it would
be a generous gesture...

39:52.930 --> 39:55.933
...to show the proper confidence
in my abilities...

39:56.058 --> 39:58.895
...if we were to take
that evidence for granted?

39:59.103 --> 40:02.106
I need it in writing, Vicomte.

40:04.692 --> 40:07.904
- Now you must leave me.
- Must I? Why?

40:08.362 --> 40:10.490
- Because I'm hungry.
- Yes?

40:10.573 --> 40:12.700
I have quite an appetite myself.

40:14.076 --> 40:16.454
Then go home and eat.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.627
In writing.

41:57.221 --> 42:01.434
You'll be pleased to hear,
my dear that Armand is on his feet again...

42:01.559 --> 42:03.311
...and back at work.

42:09.150 --> 42:10.526
Who?

42:11.819 --> 42:13.738
Monsieur Armand!

42:13.863 --> 42:16.449
Whose family you helped so generously.

42:18.034 --> 42:19.285
Oh, yes!

42:20.161 --> 42:24.206
When my nephew was last here
we discovered, quite by chance...

42:24.331 --> 42:26.333
...that he had gone into the village-

42:26.459 --> 42:28.294
Are you feeling all right, Madame?

42:28.419 --> 42:30.337
I'm sorry to interrupt, Aunt.

42:30.463 --> 42:31.839
It seemed to me, all of a sudden...

42:31.922 --> 42:34.216
...that Madame de Tourvel
didn't look at all well.

42:34.341 --> 42:36.427
- No, I'm quite all right.
- Perhaps you need some fresh air.

42:36.552 --> 42:38.137
Do you feel constricted in any way?

42:38.262 --> 42:40.806
I feel sure Madame de Volanges is right,
as usual.

42:40.931 --> 42:42.266
A turn around the grounds, perhaps.

42:42.391 --> 42:46.896
Yes, a little walk in the garden.
It's not too cool, I think.

42:47.396 --> 42:49.523
Fresh air will do you the world of good.

42:49.648 --> 42:51.984
That meal was somewhat heavy, perhaps.

42:52.234 --> 42:54.695
I can't believe that was the cause.

42:56.864 --> 42:58.240
Come back for it.

43:11.796 --> 43:13.631
Mademoiselle!

43:14.256 --> 43:17.259
I've no wish to arouse suspicion,
so I'll be brief.

43:17.384 --> 43:19.887
The letter is from the Chevalier Danceny.

43:20.304 --> 43:23.057
- Yes, I thought-
- Now, the handing over of such letters...

43:23.140 --> 43:25.976
...is a far from easy matter to accomplish.

43:26.560 --> 43:30.356
I cannot be expected to create
a diversion every day.

43:30.481 --> 43:31.690
So...

43:33.150 --> 43:35.069
This key resembles your bedroom key.

43:35.194 --> 43:37.404
I happen to know it is kept
in your mother's room...

43:37.530 --> 43:39.156
...on the mantelpiece,
tied with a blue ribbon.

43:39.281 --> 43:41.742
Take it,
go up and attach the blue ribbon to it...

43:41.867 --> 43:43.577
...and put it in the place
of your bedroom key.

43:43.661 --> 43:47.122
Bring it to me and I will get
a copy cut within two hours.

43:47.373 --> 43:50.125
Then I can collect your letters
and deliver Danceny's...

43:50.251 --> 43:52.461
...without any complications.

43:52.837 --> 43:55.506
Now, in the cupboard by your bed...

43:55.631 --> 43:57.842
...you'll find a feather
and a small bottle of oil...

43:57.967 --> 44:01.595
...so that you may oil the lock
and hinges on the ante-room door.

44:02.596 --> 44:04.056
Are you sure, Monsieur?

44:04.139 --> 44:05.599
Trust me.

44:09.228 --> 44:11.021
Believe me, Mademoiselle...

44:11.230 --> 44:15.276
...if there's one thing I can't abide,
it's deceitfulness.

44:40.301 --> 44:43.137
I trust you are feeling a little better,
Madame.

44:52.354 --> 44:56.817
If I were ill, Monsieur, it would not be
difficult to guess who was responsible.

44:59.903 --> 45:02.114
You can't mean me, do you?

45:02.197 --> 45:04.575
- You promised to leave here.
- And I did.

45:04.867 --> 45:07.286
Would you excuse me, Madame?

45:24.511 --> 45:26.847
Quick, your mother.

45:38.442 --> 45:39.985
What are you doing?

45:40.944 --> 45:43.697
I just came in to fetch your shawl.

46:35.874 --> 46:37.751
Why are you so angry with me?

46:37.876 --> 46:41.380
All I can offer you is my friendship.
Can't you accept it?

46:41.797 --> 46:44.550
I could pretend to,
but that would be dishonest.

46:44.675 --> 46:48.178
The man I used to be would have been
content with friendship...

46:48.804 --> 46:52.057
...and then set about trying
to turn it to his advantage.

46:52.140 --> 46:53.851
But I have changed now.

46:54.476 --> 46:59.273
I can't conceal from you that
I love you tenderly, passionately...

46:59.398 --> 47:02.067
...and above all, respectfully.

47:04.319 --> 47:07.906
So how am I to demote myself
to the tepid position of friend?

47:08.031 --> 47:11.118
Not that you are even
pretending to show friendship.

47:12.119 --> 47:14.621
- What do you mean?
- Well, is this friendly?

47:16.999 --> 47:20.586
Why must you deliberately
destroy my peace of mind?

47:27.718 --> 47:30.554
You were wrong to feel threatened by me,
Madame.

47:30.887 --> 47:34.725
Your happiness is far more
important to me than my own.

47:35.225 --> 47:37.978
That is what I mean
when I say that I love you.

47:39.730 --> 47:42.190
I think we should end this conversation.

47:42.649 --> 47:45.319
I shall leave you in
possession of the field.

47:49.823 --> 47:51.074
But look...

47:51.533 --> 47:55.037
We are to be living under the same roof,
at least for a few days.

47:55.162 --> 47:57.998
Surely we don't have to try
to avoid each other?

47:59.458 --> 48:00.834
Of course not.

48:00.917 --> 48:04.004
Provided you adhere
to my few simple rules.

48:04.254 --> 48:07.591
I shall obey you in this as in everything.

48:15.515 --> 48:16.683
Monsieur...

48:19.353 --> 48:20.520
What?

48:21.897 --> 48:23.148
Nothing.

49:37.681 --> 49:39.349
Nothing to worry about.

49:40.308 --> 49:42.060
Have you brought a letter?

49:42.144 --> 49:43.061
No.

49:44.104 --> 49:45.355
Then what...?

49:53.363 --> 49:55.657
What are you going to tell your mother?

49:55.782 --> 49:58.869
How will you explain the fact
that I have your key?

49:59.327 --> 50:01.538
If I tell her I'm here at your invitation...

50:01.621 --> 50:04.457
...I have a feeling she will believe me.

50:09.087 --> 50:10.422
What do you want?

50:10.505 --> 50:12.132
Well, I don't know...

50:15.093 --> 50:16.344
What do you think?

50:16.469 --> 50:17.304
No!

50:17.429 --> 50:18.597
All right.

50:20.015 --> 50:22.225
I just want you to give me a kiss.

50:25.270 --> 50:26.897
- A kiss?
- That's all.

50:28.899 --> 50:31.109
- Then will you go?
- Then I'll go.

50:31.192 --> 50:33.403
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

50:54.049 --> 50:55.300
All right?

50:56.635 --> 50:58.053
Very nice.

50:58.386 --> 51:00.305
No, I mean, will you go now?

51:00.388 --> 51:02.349
Oh, I don't think so.

51:03.683 --> 51:05.018
But you promised.

51:05.101 --> 51:07.479
I promised to go when you gave me a kiss.

51:07.604 --> 51:10.273
You didn't give me a kiss.
I gave you a kiss.

51:10.565 --> 51:12.317
Not the same thing at all.

51:13.485 --> 51:15.445
And if I give you a kiss...?

51:15.528 --> 51:19.366
Let's just get ourselves more comfortable,
shall we?

51:49.354 --> 51:51.689
I had better go and see what's wrong,
if you will excuse me.

51:51.773 --> 51:53.608
Of course, my dear.

51:53.900 --> 51:54.984
I shouldn't worry, Madame.

51:55.110 --> 51:58.780
The young have such miraculous
powers of recuperation.

51:59.656 --> 52:02.700
I'm sure she will soon
be back in the saddle.

52:37.652 --> 52:40.655
Who else can I turn to in
my desperation,  Madame?

52:41.489 --> 52:44.367
And how can I write
the necessary words?

53:11.644 --> 53:14.439
There's something going on,
and Cécile will not tell me.

53:14.522 --> 53:16.733
You must speak to her at once.

53:17.567 --> 53:18.902
Tell me...

53:19.193 --> 53:21.154
...you resisted him, did you?

53:21.738 --> 53:23.239
Of course I did...

53:23.907 --> 53:25.533
...as much as I could.

53:25.825 --> 53:27.911
- But he forced you?
- No...

53:29.829 --> 53:31.122
...not exactly.

53:32.957 --> 53:35.543
But I found it almost
impossible to defend myself.

53:35.627 --> 53:37.795
Why was that? Did he tie you up?

53:40.381 --> 53:43.509
No, he just has a way of putting things.

53:44.552 --> 53:46.512
You can't think of an answer.

53:46.596 --> 53:48.514
Not even "no"?

53:49.140 --> 53:52.018
I kept on saying no all the time.

53:54.896 --> 53:57.523
But somehow,
that was not what I was doing.

54:01.527 --> 54:03.363
I am so ashamed.

54:09.744 --> 54:12.163
You'll find the shame is like the pain.

54:14.832 --> 54:17.168
You only feel it once.

54:25.176 --> 54:27.220
You really want my advice?

54:35.937 --> 54:36.979
Please.

54:39.232 --> 54:41.275
Allow Monsieur de Valmont...

54:41.359 --> 54:44.153
...to continue your instruction.

54:46.114 --> 54:49.409
Convince your mother
you've forgotten Danceny.

54:50.076 --> 54:52.036
And raise no objection to the marriage.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.955
With Monsieur de Bastide?

54:54.288 --> 54:57.625
When it comes to marriage,
one man is as good as the next.

54:57.709 --> 55:01.254
And even the least accommodating
is less trouble than a mother.

55:02.171 --> 55:05.466
Are you saying, I'm going to have to do...

55:05.550 --> 55:07.718
...that, with three different men?

55:07.885 --> 55:10.388
I am saying, you stupid little girl...

55:10.471 --> 55:13.349
...that provided you take
a few elementary precautions...

55:13.433 --> 55:15.268
...you can do it, or not...

55:15.351 --> 55:17.061
...with as many men as you like...

55:17.145 --> 55:18.396
...as often as you like...

55:18.479 --> 55:21.023
...in as many different ways as you like.

55:21.941 --> 55:26.612
Our sex has few enough advantages,
so make the best of those you have.

55:29.907 --> 55:31.659
Now, here comes your
maman...

55:31.742 --> 55:35.496
...so remember what I've said,
and above all, no snivelling.

55:44.046 --> 55:46.007
How are you feeling now, my dear?

55:46.090 --> 55:48.050
Much better, thank you,
maman.

55:48.551 --> 55:51.053
I think you look tired.
I think you should go to bed.

55:51.137 --> 55:51.888
No, I-

55:51.971 --> 55:53.723
I think you should do
as your mother suggests.

55:53.806 --> 55:56.601
We can arrange to have
something brought to your room.

55:56.684 --> 55:58.686
I'm sure it will do you good.

55:59.896 --> 56:02.148
Well, perhaps you are right, Madame.

56:06.027 --> 56:09.113
You have such a very good
influence on her.

56:32.929 --> 56:36.098
I don't think I have congratulated you
on your revenge.

56:36.182 --> 56:38.184
- So, you know.
- Oh, yes.

56:38.684 --> 56:42.688
And I believe from now
you will find her door unbolted.

56:53.157 --> 56:54.408
Where is she?

56:54.492 --> 56:56.494
I can't see her at the moment.

56:59.538 --> 57:03.709
Surely I have explained to you before
how much I enjoy watching the battle...

57:03.793 --> 57:05.294
...between love and virtue.

57:05.378 --> 57:08.089
What concerns me is that
you seem to enjoy watching it...

57:08.172 --> 57:10.758
...much more than you used
to enjoy winning it.

57:10.841 --> 57:12.218
All in good time.

57:13.010 --> 57:16.013
The century is drawing to its close.

57:19.684 --> 57:21.477
Isn't it a pity that our agreement...

57:21.560 --> 57:24.855
...does not relate to the task you set me...

57:25.731 --> 57:28.359
...rather than the task I set myself?

57:28.693 --> 57:30.569
I am grateful, of course.

57:31.070 --> 57:34.240
But that would have been
almost insultingly simple.

57:34.865 --> 57:38.577
One does not applaud the tenor
for clearing his throat.

59:58.759 --> 01:00:01.553
As with every other science,
the first thing you must learn...

01:00:01.637 --> 01:00:03.681
...is to call everything by its proper name.

01:00:03.764 --> 01:00:06.183
I don't see why we have to talk at all.

01:00:06.308 --> 01:00:08.310
Without the correct polite vocabulary...

01:00:08.394 --> 01:00:10.771
...how would you indicate
what you would like me to do...

01:00:10.854 --> 01:00:13.732
...or make an offer of something
I might find agreeable.

01:00:13.816 --> 01:00:14.817
Surely you just-

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.027
You see, if I do my work adequately...

01:00:17.111 --> 01:00:18.946
...I would like to think that
you will be able to...

01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:22.074
...surprise Monsieur de Bastide
on his wedding night.

01:00:22.408 --> 01:00:24.451
- Would he be pleased?
- Of course.

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:28.914
He'll merely assume your  maman
has done her duty and fully briefed you.

01:00:29.081 --> 01:00:32.209
Maman couldn't possibly
talk of anything of that sort.

01:00:32.292 --> 01:00:33.794
I can't think why.

01:00:33.919 --> 01:00:37.673
She was, after all, one of the most
notorious young women in Paris.

01:00:38.173 --> 01:00:39.633
-  Maman?
- Certainly.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.678
More noted for her enthusiasm
than her ability...

01:00:42.761 --> 01:00:44.888
...if I remember rightly.

01:00:45.264 --> 01:00:48.559
There was a famous occasion
before you were born...

01:00:48.809 --> 01:00:50.477
This would have been...

01:00:56.108 --> 01:00:59.445
...when your mother went to stay
with the Comtesse de Beaulieu...

01:00:59.528 --> 01:01:02.322
...who tactfully gave her a room
between your father's...

01:01:02.406 --> 01:01:03.782
...and that of a Monsieur de Vressac...

01:01:03.866 --> 01:01:06.577
...who was her acknowledged
lover at the time.

01:01:06.744 --> 01:01:09.788
Yet,
in spite of these careful arrangements...

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.250
...she contrived to spend
the night with a third party.

01:01:14.418 --> 01:01:15.669
I can't believe that.

01:01:15.753 --> 01:01:17.838
No, no, I assure you, it's true.

01:01:18.797 --> 01:01:20.299
How do you know?

01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:23.135
The third party was myself.

01:01:37.608 --> 01:01:40.944
You asked me if Monsieur de Bastide
would be pleased with your abilities.

01:01:41.028 --> 01:01:42.696
And the answer is...

01:01:43.697 --> 01:01:46.325
...education is never a waste.

01:01:53.665 --> 01:01:54.666
Now...

01:01:56.418 --> 01:01:58.378
...I think we might begin...

01:01:59.129 --> 01:02:01.798
...with one or two Latin terms.

01:02:37.751 --> 01:02:40.462
We go for a walk together
almost every day.

01:02:40.879 --> 01:02:43.465
A little further every
time down the path...

01:02:43.548 --> 01:02:45.259
... that has no turning.

01:02:46.551 --> 01:02:48.345
She has accepted my love...

01:02:48.428 --> 01:02:50.597
... I have accepted her friendship.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:55.811
We are both aware of how little
there is to choose between them.

01:02:55.894 --> 01:02:58.355
I wish you knew me well enough
to recognize...

01:02:58.438 --> 01:03:00.524
...how much you have changed me.

01:03:00.899 --> 01:03:04.194
My friends in Paris remarked on it at once.

01:03:04.987 --> 01:03:07.656
I have become the soul of consideration...

01:03:07.739 --> 01:03:10.200
...conscientious, charitable...

01:03:11.201 --> 01:03:13.161
...more celibate than a monk.

01:03:13.245 --> 01:03:14.288
More celibate?

01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:17.666
Well,
you know the stories one hears in Paris.

01:03:19.084 --> 01:03:22.212
I feel she is inches from surrender.

01:03:23.171 --> 01:03:24.756
Her eyes are closing.

01:03:40.897 --> 01:03:41.898
Madame.

01:03:44.276 --> 01:03:46.194
Where are you going, Monsieur?

01:03:46.278 --> 01:03:48.613
- To the salon.
- There is no one there.

01:03:48.739 --> 01:03:51.366
The others have all decided
on an early night.

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:54.536
- I very much missed our walk today.
- Yes.

01:03:57.330 --> 01:04:01.668
I fear with the weather as it is, we can
look forward to very few more of them.

01:04:01.752 --> 01:04:05.964
- This heavy rain is surely exceptional.
- Yes. May I?

01:04:08.258 --> 01:04:10.218
Of course.

01:04:15.682 --> 01:04:19.728
But, you see, within a week
I shall have concluded my business.

01:04:24.608 --> 01:04:26.318
- I see.
- Even so, I am not sure...

01:04:26.401 --> 01:04:28.528
...I will be able to bring myself to leave.

01:04:28.612 --> 01:04:29.654
Oh, please. You must.

01:04:29.738 --> 01:04:31.531
Are you still so anxious to be rid of me?

01:04:31.615 --> 01:04:33.533
You know the answer to that.

01:04:36.578 --> 01:04:39.080
I rely on your integrity and generosity.

01:04:39.915 --> 01:04:41.208
I want to able to be grateful to you.

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:43.543
Forgive me if I say
I do not want your gratitude.

01:04:43.627 --> 01:04:46.630
What I want from you
is something altogether deeper.

01:04:49.132 --> 01:04:52.928
I know God is punishing me for my pride.
I was so certain this could never happen.

01:04:53.011 --> 01:04:54.679
Nothing like what? Do you mean love?

01:04:54.763 --> 01:04:56.640
- Is love what you mean?
- You promised not to speak of it.

01:04:56.723 --> 01:04:58.642
Yes, of course, I understand,
but I must know.

01:04:58.725 --> 01:05:00.936
I can't, don't you understand?
It's impossible.

01:05:01.019 --> 01:05:04.439
You don't have to speak. Just look at me.

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:19.329
Yes...

01:05:45.021 --> 01:05:48.858
For God's sake, you must leave
me if you don't want to kill me.

01:05:49.568 --> 01:05:51.278
You must help...

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.990
Fetch Madame,
Madame de Tourvel has been taken ill.

01:07:39.385 --> 01:07:41.387
I heard something as I was passing.

01:07:41.471 --> 01:07:44.140
She seemed to be having
difficulty breathing.

01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:47.227
- Oh, my dear, whatever is it?
- I am all right now.

01:07:48.061 --> 01:07:51.105
I shall leave her
in your capable hands, Aunt.

01:07:51.272 --> 01:07:53.316
We must send for a doctor, my dear.

01:07:53.399 --> 01:07:56.402
No, no, please.
I don't need a doctor. I just...

01:07:59.239 --> 01:08:01.491
Sit with me for a moment.

01:08:42.031 --> 01:08:44.033
I must leave this house.

01:08:45.493 --> 01:08:47.996
I am most desperately in love.

01:08:49.162 --> 01:08:52.584
To leave is the last thing in the world
I want to do, but...

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:55.377
...I'd rather die than
to live with the guilt.

01:08:55.461 --> 01:08:59.131
My dear girl,
none of this is any surprise to me.

01:08:59.881 --> 01:09:04.679
The only thing that might surprise
one is how little the world changes.

01:09:04.845 --> 01:09:07.265
What should I do? What is your advice?

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.892
If I remember rightly in such matters...

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.770
...all advice is useless.

01:09:14.022 --> 01:09:16.024
I have never been so unhappy.

01:09:16.107 --> 01:09:18.276
I'm sorry to say this but...

01:09:18.693 --> 01:09:23.323
...those who are most worthy of love
are never made happy by it.

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:25.992
But why? Why should that be?

01:09:26.492 --> 01:09:30.412
Do you still think men
love the way we do?

01:09:31.288 --> 01:09:32.290
No...

01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:35.126
...men enjoy the happiness they feel.

01:09:36.586 --> 01:09:40.089
We can only enjoy the happiness we give.

01:09:42.966 --> 01:09:45.303
They are not capable...

01:09:45.553 --> 01:09:49.223
...of devoting themselves
exclusively to one person.

01:09:50.475 --> 01:09:53.810
So to hope to be made happy by love...

01:09:54.562 --> 01:09:57.690
...is a certain cause of grief.

01:09:59.859 --> 01:10:02.320
I am devoted to my nephew.

01:10:02.612 --> 01:10:04.739
But what is true of most men...

01:10:05.406 --> 01:10:07.784
...is doubly so of him.

01:10:09.494 --> 01:10:10.578
And yet...

01:10:11.329 --> 01:10:13.956
...he could have, just now...

01:10:16.626 --> 01:10:18.336
...he took pity on me.

01:10:19.504 --> 01:10:22.256
If he has released you...

01:10:23.007 --> 01:10:26.219
...my dear child, you must go.

01:10:35.002 --> 01:10:36.462
Get up, sir, quick.

01:10:37.672 --> 01:10:38.548
Sir!

01:10:43.553 --> 01:10:44.929
Over here.

01:10:48.891 --> 01:10:49.684
What is it?

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:52.228
- Madame de Tourvel.
- What?

01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:58.359
I want you to follow her, right now.
Stay close to her.

01:10:58.693 --> 01:11:00.570
I want to know everything.

01:11:01.112 --> 01:11:05.658
Where she goes. Who she sees.
What she eats. If she sleeps.

01:11:05.992 --> 01:11:07.160
Everything.

01:11:13.082 --> 01:11:15.126
That's for bribes. Yours will come later.

01:11:15.209 --> 01:11:16.711
- Yes, sir.
- Now, go.

01:11:17.003 --> 01:11:17.837
Go!

01:11:31.517 --> 01:11:33.394
Dear Father Anselme...

01:11:33.686 --> 01:11:35.605
... try as I may, I cannot see...

01:11:35.688 --> 01:11:38.441
... the necessity for the interview
you suggest.

01:11:38.774 --> 01:11:41.694
However, since you insist...

01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:43.487
... I propose you bring him to see me...

01:11:43.571 --> 01:11:46.782
... on Thursday, the
28th at six o'clock p. m.

01:11:52.788 --> 01:11:56.250
This is excellent.
Make sure Father Anselme receives it.

01:11:57.585 --> 01:11:58.711
What news?

01:12:00.087 --> 01:12:01.297
No visitors.

01:12:01.547 --> 01:12:04.842
There still has not been
a single visitor since she got back.

01:12:04.926 --> 01:12:07.511
A bite of soup last night,
didn't touch the pheasant.

01:12:07.595 --> 01:12:09.347
Afterwards, a cup of tea.

01:12:09.639 --> 01:12:11.349
Nothing else to report.

01:12:12.475 --> 01:12:14.101
Oh yes, sir, there is.

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:16.729
You wanted to know
what she was reading.

01:12:17.521 --> 01:12:20.232
The book by her bed is
"Christian Thoughts...

01:12:21.317 --> 01:12:22.693
"... Volume Two. "

01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:29.742
How is Julie?

01:12:31.285 --> 01:12:34.080
She seems a bit keener than
she was in the country.

01:12:34.163 --> 01:12:35.665
And yourself?

01:12:36.666 --> 01:12:38.751
Talk about devotion to duty.

01:12:40.086 --> 01:12:41.379
Off you go.

01:12:42.421 --> 01:12:43.673
Keep it up.

01:12:45.549 --> 01:12:47.468
- Madame...
- Vicomte...

01:12:52.515 --> 01:12:53.683
Well...

01:12:56.852 --> 01:12:59.188
...what a pleasant surprise.

01:13:02.525 --> 01:13:03.693
Danceny...

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:06.153
Thank you, Monsieur, for everything.

01:13:06.362 --> 01:13:09.657
Well, I was afraid I had been
a sad disappointment to you.

01:13:10.157 --> 01:13:11.534
On the contrary.

01:13:12.201 --> 01:13:14.578
It is you I have to thank
for keeping our love alive.

01:13:14.662 --> 01:13:17.206
Well, as to love, Cécile
thinks of little else.

01:13:17.289 --> 01:13:19.792
She and her mother are coming
back to Paris in two weeks...

01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:21.711
...and she is longing to see you.

01:13:21.794 --> 01:13:24.255
I have had the most
wonderful letter from her.

01:13:24.338 --> 01:13:24.755
Really?

01:13:24.839 --> 01:13:28.092
Not like any of her other letters,
somehow...

01:13:30.386 --> 01:13:33.055
...quite a different tone of voice.

01:13:35.015 --> 01:13:36.892
My dearest...

01:13:37.768 --> 01:13:39.061
...Danceny...

01:13:40.855 --> 01:13:42.940
...I swear to you...

01:13:43.357 --> 01:13:44.900
...on my chastity...

01:13:45.025 --> 01:13:50.531
...that even if my mother forces me
to go through with this marriage...

01:13:51.449 --> 01:13:54.410
...I shall be yours completely.

01:13:55.619 --> 01:13:58.873
Your friend, the Vicomte de Valmont...

01:13:59.373 --> 01:14:02.001
... has been very active on your behalf.

01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:04.587
I doubt if you could do more yourself.

01:14:06.672 --> 01:14:10.509
I don't know how I could bear to go
another two weeks without seeing her.

01:14:10.593 --> 01:14:14.597
We shall have to do our very best
to provide some distraction for you.

01:14:15.055 --> 01:14:16.849
If you would be so kind
as to wait in the carriage.

01:14:16.932 --> 01:14:20.394
There's a matter I must discuss
with the Vicomte in private.

01:14:21.228 --> 01:14:22.480
Of course.

01:14:22.855 --> 01:14:25.232
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:27.318
Don't give it another thought.

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:31.947
It's been delightful.

01:14:37.161 --> 01:14:39.121
Poor boy, he's quite harmless.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:42.708
Sometimes, Vicomte,
I can't help, but adore you.

01:14:42.917 --> 01:14:46.378
I have a piece of news I hope
you might find entertaining.

01:14:46.879 --> 01:14:50.758
I have reason to believe
the next head of the house of Bastide...

01:14:50.966 --> 01:14:52.384
...may be a Valmont.

01:14:52.468 --> 01:14:54.053
What can you mean?

01:14:54.261 --> 01:14:56.597
Cécile is two weeks late.

01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:00.851
Aren't you pleased?

01:15:00.976 --> 01:15:02.186
I'm not sure.

01:15:02.645 --> 01:15:05.022
Your aim was to revenge yourself
on Bastide.

01:15:05.105 --> 01:15:08.734
I have provided him with a wife trained
by me to perform, quite naturally...

01:15:08.817 --> 01:15:12.071
...services one would hesitate
to request from a professional...

01:15:12.154 --> 01:15:14.698
...and very likely pregnant as well.

01:15:16.075 --> 01:15:17.743
What more do you want?

01:15:18.285 --> 01:15:22.289
All right, Vicomte, I agree.
You have more than done your duty.

01:15:23.207 --> 01:15:26.335
Shame you let the other ones
slip through your fingers.

01:15:29.588 --> 01:15:31.048
I let her go.

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:32.383
But why?

01:15:32.967 --> 01:15:34.051
I was moved.

01:15:34.134 --> 01:15:36.637
Oh, well then, no wonder you bungled it.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.014
I have an appointment
to visit her on Thursday...

01:15:39.098 --> 01:15:41.475
...and this time I shall be merciless.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.310
I am pleased to hear it.

01:15:48.565 --> 01:15:50.651
Why do you suppose we...

01:15:50.776 --> 01:15:53.904
...only feel compelled to chase
the ones who run away?

01:15:54.446 --> 01:15:55.781
Immaturity?

01:15:55.864 --> 01:15:58.534
I shan't have a moment's peace
until its over.

01:15:59.535 --> 01:16:02.538
I love her, I hate her...

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.332
...my life is a misery.

01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:12.798
Well, I think I may have kept
our young friend waiting long enough.

01:16:12.881 --> 01:16:15.759
I shall call on you
sometime soon after Thursday.

01:16:16.051 --> 01:16:17.344
Only if you succeed, Vicomte.

01:16:17.428 --> 01:16:20.264
I am not sure I can face
another catalogue of incompetence.

01:16:20.347 --> 01:16:21.724
I shall succeed.

01:16:21.932 --> 01:16:23.016
I hope so.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.103
Once upon a time you were
a man to be reckoned with.

01:17:26.079 --> 01:17:27.873
I understand that Father Anselme...

01:17:27.956 --> 01:17:30.250
...has explained to you
the reason for my visit?

01:17:30.334 --> 01:17:32.586
Yes, he said you wished
to be reconciled with me...

01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:35.172
...before beginning instruction with him.

01:17:35.339 --> 01:17:36.715
That is correct.

01:17:37.758 --> 01:17:41.678
But I see no need for formal reconciliation,
Monsieur.

01:17:41.803 --> 01:17:42.387
No.

01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:44.765
When I have, as you said, insulted you...

01:17:44.848 --> 01:17:48.352
...and when you have treated me
with an unqualified contempt.

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:51.021
Contempt?

01:17:51.897 --> 01:17:54.191
You ran away from my aunt's house
in the middle of the night.

01:17:54.274 --> 01:17:57.110
You refuse to answer
or even receive my letters.

01:17:57.277 --> 01:17:59.655
And all this,
after I have shown a restraint...

01:17:59.738 --> 01:18:01.949
...of which I think we are both aware.

01:18:02.032 --> 01:18:04.701
I would call that,
at the very least, contempt.

01:18:04.785 --> 01:18:07.663
I am sure you understand me better
than you pretend to, Monsieur.

01:18:07.746 --> 01:18:10.123
It was me you ran away from, wasn't it?

01:18:11.458 --> 01:18:12.626
I had to leave.

01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:15.087
And do you have to keep away from me?

01:18:22.469 --> 01:18:25.973
I am as unhappy as you could
ever have wanted me to be.

01:18:27.182 --> 01:18:29.601
I have only ever wanted your happiness.

01:18:30.102 --> 01:18:32.479
How can I be happy without you?

01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:35.232
I must have you, or die.

01:18:46.326 --> 01:18:47.536
Death it is.

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:54.918
I'm sorry, Madame.

01:18:55.419 --> 01:18:58.088
All I wanted from this meeting
was your forgiveness...

01:18:58.171 --> 01:19:00.924
...for the wrongs that you think
that I have done you.

01:19:01.008 --> 01:19:03.844
So that I may end my days
in some peace of mind.

01:19:04.094 --> 01:19:08.056
I understood you approved of the choice
my duty has compelled me to make.

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:09.016
Yes.

01:19:09.349 --> 01:19:11.643
And your choice has determined mine.

01:19:11.935 --> 01:19:12.894
Which is what?

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:16.314
The only choice capable of
putting an end to my suffering.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.566
What do you mean?

01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:19.109
I love you.

01:19:19.359 --> 01:19:20.694
You have no idea how much.

01:19:20.777 --> 01:19:23.947
Just remember I have made
far more difficult sacrifices...

01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:26.658
...than the one I am about to make. Now...

01:19:30.203 --> 01:19:31.621
- ... goodbye.
- No.

01:19:31.872 --> 01:19:33.582
You must listen to me!

01:19:33.665 --> 01:19:34.791
No!

01:19:57.898 --> 01:20:01.693
Why should you be so upset
by the idea of making me happy?

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:07.240
You are right. I cannot live
either unless I make you happy.

01:20:09.785 --> 01:20:11.036
So I promise...

01:20:11.828 --> 01:20:13.413
...no more refusals...

01:20:14.706 --> 01:20:16.374
...and no more regrets.

01:20:32.224 --> 01:20:36.811
Success!

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.648
Well...

01:20:39.856 --> 01:20:41.775
...I arrived at about six.

01:20:42.234 --> 01:20:45.195
Yes, I think you may omit
the details of the seduction.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.155
They are never very enlivening.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.115
Just describe the event itself.

01:20:49.241 --> 01:20:51.201
It was, unprecedented.

01:20:51.826 --> 01:20:52.744
Really?

01:20:52.953 --> 01:20:58.291
It had a kind of charm that
I don't think I have experienced before.

01:20:59.417 --> 01:21:03.880
Once she'd surrendered,
she behaved with perfect candour.

01:21:04.464 --> 01:21:06.591
Total mutual delirium.

01:21:06.841 --> 01:21:11.054
Which, for the first time ever with me,
outlasted the pleasure itself.

01:21:11.972 --> 01:21:13.515
She was astonishing.

01:21:15.225 --> 01:21:19.771
So much so, that I ended by falling on
my knees and pledging her eternal love.

01:21:21.022 --> 01:21:23.024
And do you know that at that time...

01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:26.945
...and for several hours afterwards
I actually meant it.

01:21:30.073 --> 01:21:31.199
I see.

01:21:32.784 --> 01:21:34.744
It's extraordinary, isn't it?

01:21:35.662 --> 01:21:36.830
Is it?

01:21:36.997 --> 01:21:40.083
- It sounds to me perfectly commonplace.
- Oh, no...

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:41.584
...I assure you.

01:21:42.877 --> 01:21:45.463
But of course, the best thing about it is...

01:21:45.714 --> 01:21:50.010
...I am now in a position
to be able to claim my reward.

01:21:58.101 --> 01:22:01.354
You mean to say you persuaded her
to write a letter as well...

01:22:01.479 --> 01:22:04.024
...in the course of
this awesome encounter?

01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:08.695
I didn't necessarily think you were
going to be a stickler for formalities.

01:22:10.822 --> 01:22:15.035
In any case, I may have to declare
our arrangement null and void.

01:22:19.622 --> 01:22:21.166
What do you mean?

01:22:22.792 --> 01:22:24.878
I am not accustomed
to be taken for granted.

01:22:25.003 --> 01:22:27.047
But there is no question of that.

01:22:27.172 --> 01:22:29.049
You are misunderstanding me.

01:22:29.174 --> 01:22:32.469
And I have no wish to tear you away
from the arms of someone so astonishing.

01:22:32.594 --> 01:22:34.471
We have always been
frank with one another.

01:22:34.554 --> 01:22:36.806
And as a matter of fact,
I have also taken a new lover...

01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:39.059
...who at the moment,
is proving more than satisfactory.

01:22:39.184 --> 01:22:41.394
- Who is that?
- I am not in the mood for confidences.

01:22:41.519 --> 01:22:43.146
Don't let me keep you.

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:48.610
You can't seriously imagine
I prefer her to you?

01:22:48.735 --> 01:22:50.278
You may genuinely be unaware of this.

01:22:50.403 --> 01:22:54.032
But I can see quite plainly
that you are in love with this woman.

01:22:54.949 --> 01:22:55.742
No.

01:22:57.869 --> 01:22:59.120
Not at all.

01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:02.540
Have you forgotten what it is like
to make a woman happy?

01:23:02.665 --> 01:23:04.292
And to be made happy yourself?

01:23:04.417 --> 01:23:05.293
I?

01:23:06.085 --> 01:23:07.295
Of course not.

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.631
We loved each other once, didn't we?

01:23:10.298 --> 01:23:11.841
I think it was love.

01:23:13.092 --> 01:23:14.803
And you made me very happy.

01:23:14.886 --> 01:23:17.347
And we could again.
We just untied the knot.

01:23:17.472 --> 01:23:19.015
It was never broken.

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:21.810
lllusions of course,
are by their nature sweet.

01:23:21.935 --> 01:23:25.271
I have no illusions.
I lost them on my travels.

01:23:30.610 --> 01:23:31.653
Now...

01:23:32.403 --> 01:23:34.113
...I want to come home.

01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:47.961
As for this present infatuation,
it won't last...

01:23:48.044 --> 01:23:51.297
...but for the moment,
it is beyond my control.

01:24:35.508 --> 01:24:39.554
My dear Vicomte, I'm obliged
to go away for a couple of weeks...

01:24:39.679 --> 01:24:42.765
... but I am well aware
of our arrangement.

01:24:44.309 --> 01:24:49.105
On my return you and I will spend
a single night together.

01:24:50.231 --> 01:24:54.110
We shall enjoy it enough
to regret it is to be our last.

01:24:54.402 --> 01:25:00.158
But then we shall remember, that regret
is an essential component of happiness.

01:25:01.034 --> 01:25:02.201
All this, of course...

01:25:02.285 --> 01:25:06.247
... providing you are able
to procure this famous letter.

01:25:12.295 --> 01:25:14.422
It shall be done!

01:25:14.964 --> 01:25:18.718
But, Paris is so tedious without you.

01:25:19.302 --> 01:25:22.388
And I am living like a medieval hermit.

01:25:29.395 --> 01:25:31.105
All right, give me a moment.

01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:32.315
Drink up.

01:25:32.398 --> 01:25:33.566
What is it?

01:25:33.691 --> 01:25:36.611
Someone who may well
not appreciate your presence.

01:25:36.736 --> 01:25:40.073
- You mean a woman?
- A lady, we might even say.

01:25:40.865 --> 01:25:43.076
It is not the one we wrote that letter to?

01:25:43.159 --> 01:25:45.453
- The very one.
- I enjoyed that.

01:25:45.578 --> 01:25:48.247
You proved a most talented desk.

01:25:49.707 --> 01:25:50.958
I'd like to see what she looks like.

01:25:51.084 --> 01:25:52.960
- Well, you can't.
- Oh...

01:26:00.426 --> 01:26:04.639
On second thoughts,
I don't see why you shouldn't.

01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:14.607
Tell me,
do you have plans for this evening?

01:26:14.732 --> 01:26:16.108
A few friends round for dinner.

01:26:16.192 --> 01:26:19.278
- And after dinner?
- Nothing firm.

01:26:23.199 --> 01:26:24.200
Well...

01:26:49.976 --> 01:26:51.352
I will be there.

01:27:08.953 --> 01:27:11.872
This is an unexpected pleasure.

01:27:12.081 --> 01:27:15.167
- I know that woman.
- Are you sure? I would be surprised.

01:27:15.293 --> 01:27:17.420
She has been pointed out
to me at the opera.

01:27:17.503 --> 01:27:19.630
Yes, well, she is striking.

01:27:20.423 --> 01:27:22.383
She is a courtesan, isn't she?

01:27:26.721 --> 01:27:29.181
Yes, I suppose, in a manner of speaking.

01:27:29.724 --> 01:27:31.684
Well I am sorry to have disturbed you.

01:27:31.767 --> 01:27:34.437
Of course you have not disturbed me.
I'm overjoyed to see you.

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.397
You will never be received
at my house again.

01:27:36.522 --> 01:27:38.482
I don't want your lies and excuses.

01:27:38.608 --> 01:27:41.235
Sit down. Just hear me out.
That is all I ask.

01:27:41.319 --> 01:27:43.112
Then you can judge.

01:27:58.336 --> 01:28:01.922
Unfortunately, I cannot unlive
the years I lived before I met you...

01:28:02.006 --> 01:28:04.842
...and during those years
I had a wide acquaintance...

01:28:04.925 --> 01:28:09.096
...the majority of whom were no doubt
undesirable in one respect or another.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.097
Now...

01:28:10.181 --> 01:28:12.475
...it may surprise you
to know that Emilie...

01:28:12.558 --> 01:28:16.145
...in common with many others
of her character and profession...

01:28:16.312 --> 01:28:18.939
...is kind-hearted enough
to take an interest...

01:28:19.023 --> 01:28:21.233
...in those less fortunate than herself.

01:28:21.317 --> 01:28:22.902
In short...

01:28:23.152 --> 01:28:28.449
...she has the time and the inclination
to do a great deal of charity work.

01:28:30.242 --> 01:28:33.829
Donations to hospitals, soup for the poor...

01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:39.251
...protection for animals...

01:28:39.543 --> 01:28:42.797
...anything which touches
her sentimental heart.

01:28:43.839 --> 01:28:48.677
From time to time, I make a small
contribution to her purse. That's all.

01:28:52.348 --> 01:28:54.100
Is that true?

01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:56.102
My relations with Emilie...

01:28:56.185 --> 01:28:59.105
...have been, for some years now,
quite blameless.

01:28:59.438 --> 01:29:04.193
I mean, she has even done a little
secretarial work for me on occasion.

01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.403
Why did she laugh?

01:29:06.487 --> 01:29:08.155
I have no idea.

01:29:09.448 --> 01:29:11.158
Does she know about me?

01:29:11.742 --> 01:29:14.411
No doubt she made what,
in view of my past...

01:29:14.537 --> 01:29:17.873
...must be regarded as a fair assumption.

01:29:23.754 --> 01:29:25.589
I want to believe you.

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.842
I knew you were coming up.

01:29:28.592 --> 01:29:30.177
You were announced.

01:29:38.727 --> 01:29:39.979
I am sorry.

01:29:49.113 --> 01:29:50.656
But no...

01:29:52.783 --> 01:29:55.494
...no, it's I who must apologize.

01:29:57.037 --> 01:29:59.915
It was most insensitive of me.

01:30:05.546 --> 01:30:09.049
I didn't think it was possible
for me to love you more.

01:30:10.342 --> 01:30:12.219
But your jealousy...

01:30:16.891 --> 01:30:19.184
I love you so much.

01:30:34.491 --> 01:30:37.703
When will you start writing to me again?

01:30:50.716 --> 01:30:52.593
My dear Vicomte...

01:30:52.718 --> 01:30:57.431
... I don't believe this self-denial
can be good for you.

01:30:57.973 --> 01:31:02.269
I hope it does not mean you are
neglecting your little pupil.

01:31:06.774 --> 01:31:08.776
But where can Danceny be?

01:31:12.112 --> 01:31:15.032
I told you,
I have all my people out looking for him.

01:31:15.115 --> 01:31:16.909
There is no trace of him.

01:31:30.964 --> 01:31:32.591
It is only the wind.

01:31:37.221 --> 01:31:38.722
Where are you?

01:31:39.098 --> 01:31:41.183
There is nothing to be frightened about.

01:31:41.266 --> 01:31:42.976
Yes, there is.

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.772
I am bleeding.

01:32:52.588 --> 01:32:54.756
Your porter seems to be
under the impression...

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.009
...that you're still out of town.

01:32:57.843 --> 01:33:00.554
I have in fact only just returned.

01:33:00.929 --> 01:33:03.390
Without attracting the attention
of your porter?

01:33:03.473 --> 01:33:06.226
I think it may be time to review
your domestic arrangements.

01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:08.896
I am exhausted.
Naturally, I instructed the porter...

01:33:08.979 --> 01:33:12.441
...to inform any casual callers
that I was out.

01:33:13.859 --> 01:33:15.569
And you here as well...

01:33:15.777 --> 01:33:18.363
...my dear, young friend.

01:33:20.407 --> 01:33:24.036
The porter appears to be having
a somewhat erratic evening.

01:33:26.496 --> 01:33:28.081
Yes.

01:33:28.248 --> 01:33:31.001
As a matter of fact,
it is you that I am looking for.

01:33:31.084 --> 01:33:32.419
Is it?

01:33:33.003 --> 01:33:37.382
Mademoiselle Cécile returns to Paris
after an absence of over two months.

01:33:37.549 --> 01:33:40.260
Now what do you suppose
is uppermost in her mind?

01:33:40.344 --> 01:33:45.140
Answer, of course, the longed-for
reunion with her beloved Chevalier.

01:33:45.223 --> 01:33:47.893
Vicomte, this is no time to make mischief.

01:33:47.976 --> 01:33:50.896
Nothing could be further
from my mind, Madame.

01:33:51.188 --> 01:33:52.147
Go on.

01:33:52.522 --> 01:33:56.568
Imagine her distress and alarm when
her loved one is nowhere to be found.

01:33:57.027 --> 01:34:00.447
I have had to do more improvising
than an Italian actor.

01:34:00.572 --> 01:34:02.783
How is she? Is she all right?

01:34:02.908 --> 01:34:05.786
Oh, yes. Well, no, to be quite frank.

01:34:06.078 --> 01:34:08.205
I'm sorry to tell you she has been ill.

01:34:08.288 --> 01:34:10.374
- Ill!
- Calm yourself, my friend.

01:34:10.791 --> 01:34:13.794
The surgeon has declared her
well on the road to recovery.

01:34:13.877 --> 01:34:17.547
But you can well imagine how
desperate I have been to find you.

01:34:17.714 --> 01:34:19.383
Of course, I...

01:34:19.549 --> 01:34:22.427
My God, how could I have
been away at such a time?

01:34:22.552 --> 01:34:24.554
How can I ever forgive myself?

01:34:27.766 --> 01:34:31.103
But look, all is well now with Cécile,
I assure you.

01:34:31.186 --> 01:34:33.814
And I shan't disturb you further.

01:34:35.023 --> 01:34:38.985
It is only that I have a little
something to show the Marquise.

01:34:50.038 --> 01:34:52.040
Wait in my dressing room.

01:34:53.125 --> 01:34:55.669
- It is through there.
- I know where it is.

01:35:05.053 --> 01:35:07.597
I see she writes as badly as she dresses.

01:35:09.015 --> 01:35:11.852
Is it really true the little one's been ill?

01:35:11.977 --> 01:35:14.312
Not so much an illness,
more a refurbishment.

01:35:14.396 --> 01:35:15.480
What do you mean?

01:35:15.564 --> 01:35:16.773
Miscarriage.

01:35:18.233 --> 01:35:20.277
Vicomte, I am so sorry.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.446
Your son and Bastide's heir.

01:35:27.659 --> 01:35:30.787
Isn't there something else
that we should be discussing?

01:35:30.871 --> 01:35:33.331
I do hope you are not going
to be difficult about Danceny.

01:35:33.415 --> 01:35:35.041
I know Belleroche was pretty limp...

01:35:35.125 --> 01:35:37.836
...but I do think you could have found
a livelier replacement...

01:35:37.919 --> 01:35:39.296
...than that mawkish schoolboy.

01:35:39.379 --> 01:35:42.048
Mawkish or not,
he's completely devoted to me.

01:35:42.215 --> 01:35:45.594
And, I suspect,
better equipped to provide me with...

01:35:45.844 --> 01:35:48.471
...happiness and pleasure than you are...

01:35:48.722 --> 01:35:50.599
...in your present mood.

01:35:50.807 --> 01:35:52.475
I see.

01:35:55.103 --> 01:35:59.149
If I thought you would be
your old charming self...

01:36:00.275 --> 01:36:03.486
...I might invite you to visit me
one evening next week.

01:36:03.862 --> 01:36:04.946
Really?

01:36:05.488 --> 01:36:07.490
I still love you, you see...

01:36:09.367 --> 01:36:12.245
...in spite of all your faults
and my complaints.

01:36:22.255 --> 01:36:25.425
Are you sure you are not going
to impose some new condition...

01:36:25.508 --> 01:36:28.845
...before you agree
to honour your obligation?

01:36:38.563 --> 01:36:43.068
I have a friend who became involved
with an entirely unsuitable woman.

01:36:43.944 --> 01:36:46.613
Whenever any of us
pointed this out to him...

01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:50.784
...he invariably made the same feeble reply:

01:36:51.451 --> 01:36:54.537
"It's beyond my control," he would say.

01:36:54.829 --> 01:36:58.208
He was on the verge of
becoming a laughing stock.

01:36:58.917 --> 01:37:02.545
At which point, another friend of mine,
a woman...

01:37:02.754 --> 01:37:05.423
...decided to speak to him seriously.

01:37:05.924 --> 01:37:08.718
She explained to him
that his name was in danger...

01:37:08.802 --> 01:37:13.139
...of being ludicrously associated
with this phrase for the rest of his life.

01:37:13.264 --> 01:37:14.891
So, do you know what he did?

01:37:14.974 --> 01:37:17.477
I feel sure you are about to tell me.

01:37:19.396 --> 01:37:23.650
He went round to see his mistress and
bluntly announced he was leaving her.

01:37:23.817 --> 01:37:26.986
Well, as you can expect,
she protested vociferously.

01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:29.572
But to everything she said...

01:37:29.656 --> 01:37:32.075
...to every objection she made...

01:37:32.409 --> 01:37:34.119
...he simply replied:

01:37:34.953 --> 01:37:37.914
"It's beyond my control. "

01:37:43.086 --> 01:37:44.629
Good night.

01:38:11.514 --> 01:38:14.267
You're only five minutes late,
but I get so frightened.

01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:16.018
I become convinced I'm never
going to see you again.

01:38:16.102 --> 01:38:18.938
- My angel.
- Is it like that for you, too?

01:38:22.567 --> 01:38:23.401
Yes.

01:38:24.443 --> 01:38:27.446
At this moment, for example,
I'm quite convinced...

01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:29.866
...I am never going to see you again.

01:38:31.075 --> 01:38:32.368
What?

01:38:33.035 --> 01:38:34.620
I'm so bored, you see.

01:38:35.288 --> 01:38:37.206
It's beyond my control.

01:38:39.625 --> 01:38:41.043
What do you mean?

01:38:43.212 --> 01:38:45.381
Well, after all, it has been four months.

01:38:45.464 --> 01:38:46.883
So, what I said:

01:38:47.091 --> 01:38:49.677
It's beyond my control.

01:38:53.764 --> 01:38:55.641
Do you mean you don't love me anymore?

01:38:55.725 --> 01:38:58.936
My love had great difficulty
outlasting your virtue.

01:38:59.228 --> 01:39:01.147
It's beyond my control.

01:39:02.815 --> 01:39:05.151
- It is that woman, isn't it?
- You are quite right.

01:39:05.234 --> 01:39:08.279
I have been deceiving you with Emilie,
among others.

01:39:08.487 --> 01:39:11.490
It's beyond my control.

01:39:13.618 --> 01:39:15.328
Why are you doing this?

01:39:16.996 --> 01:39:19.999
There's a woman.
Not Emilie, another woman.

01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:22.126
A woman I adore.

01:39:23.169 --> 01:39:26.213
And I am afraid she is insisting
that I give you up.

01:39:29.925 --> 01:39:32.470
It's beyond my control.

01:39:35.014 --> 01:39:37.475
Liar! Liar!

01:39:38.142 --> 01:39:39.935
You are quite right, I am a liar.

01:39:40.019 --> 01:39:44.440
And it's like your fidelity, a fact of life.
No more nor less irritating.

01:39:44.649 --> 01:39:47.318
- Certainly beyond my control.
- Stop it!

01:39:47.443 --> 01:39:49.153
Don't keep saying that!

01:39:50.863 --> 01:39:52.823
Sorry. Beyond my control.

01:39:56.285 --> 01:39:58.454
Why don't you take another lover?

01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:03.751
Whatever you would like.

01:40:04.126 --> 01:40:06.170
It's beyond my control.

01:40:11.634 --> 01:40:13.511
Do you want to kill me?

01:40:15.221 --> 01:40:17.390
Listen. Listen to me.

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.309
You have given me great pleasure.

01:40:20.476 --> 01:40:24.188
But I simply cannot bring myself
to regret leaving you.

01:40:24.563 --> 01:40:26.399
It is the way of the world.

01:40:26.816 --> 01:40:29.485
Quite beyond my control.

01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:15.489
- Tomorrow morning, early.
- Yes, my Lord.

01:41:21.370 --> 01:41:23.539
This is not your appointed night.

01:41:24.123 --> 01:41:25.958
That story you told me, how did it end?

01:41:26.041 --> 01:41:27.710
I am not sure I know what you mean.

01:41:27.793 --> 01:41:31.839
Once this friend of yours had taken
the advice of his lady-friend...

01:41:31.922 --> 01:41:33.674
...did she take him back?

01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:35.634
Am I to understand?

01:41:35.718 --> 01:41:39.889
The day after our last meeting,
I broke with Madame de Tourvel...

01:41:40.014 --> 01:41:43.267
...on the grounds that it was
"beyond my control. "

01:41:43.893 --> 01:41:44.810
You didn't!

01:41:44.894 --> 01:41:46.353
I certainly did.

01:41:47.897 --> 01:41:49.773
But how wonderful of you.

01:41:50.107 --> 01:41:52.818
You kept telling me
my reputation was in danger...

01:41:52.902 --> 01:41:56.697
...but I think this may well turn out
to be my most famous exploit.

01:41:56.864 --> 01:41:59.742
I believe that it sets a new standard.

01:42:01.285 --> 01:42:05.247
Only one thing could possibly
bring me greater glory.

01:42:05.623 --> 01:42:07.249
What is that?

01:42:09.543 --> 01:42:10.878
To win her back.

01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:13.213
You think you could?

01:42:13.797 --> 01:42:15.382
I do not see why not.

01:42:16.008 --> 01:42:17.635
I'll tell you why not.

01:42:19.011 --> 01:42:23.140
Because when one woman strikes at
the heart of another, she seldom misses...

01:42:23.223 --> 01:42:25.559
...and the wound is invariably fatal.

01:42:25.684 --> 01:42:27.603
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

01:42:29.772 --> 01:42:32.900
I am also inclined to see this
as one of my greatest triumphs.

01:42:32.983 --> 01:42:36.862
There is nothing a woman enjoys
so much as victory over another woman.

01:42:36.945 --> 01:42:39.531
Except you see, Vicomte,
my victory wasn't over her.

01:42:39.615 --> 01:42:41.367
Of course it was, what do you mean?

01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:42.826
It was over you.

01:42:44.453 --> 01:42:46.872
You loved that woman, Vicomte.

01:42:47.456 --> 01:42:49.249
What's more, you still do.

01:42:49.375 --> 01:42:50.834
Quite desperately.

01:42:51.752 --> 01:42:53.629
If you had not been so ashamed of it...

01:42:53.712 --> 01:42:56.465
...how could you have
treated her so viciously?

01:42:57.508 --> 01:43:01.887
You could not bear even the vague
possibility of being laughed at.

01:43:03.222 --> 01:43:06.350
And this has proved something
I have always suspected.

01:43:06.934 --> 01:43:09.353
That vanity and happiness...

01:43:10.562 --> 01:43:12.481
...are incompatible.

01:43:13.774 --> 01:43:19.571
Whatever may or may not be the truth
of these philosophical speculations...

01:43:20.406 --> 01:43:24.326
...the fact remains,
it is now your turn to make a sacrifice.

01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:25.285
Is that so?

01:43:25.369 --> 01:43:27.996
- Danceny must go.
- Where?

01:43:28.539 --> 01:43:33.544
I have been more than patient with this
little whim of yours. Enough is enough.

01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:35.379
One of the reasons that I never remarried...

01:43:35.462 --> 01:43:37.714
...despite a quite bewildering
range of offers...

01:43:37.798 --> 01:43:41.135
...was the determination never
again to be ordered around.

01:43:41.385 --> 01:43:45.764
I must therefore ask you to adopt
a less "marital" tone of voice.

01:43:45.931 --> 01:43:50.352
She is ill, you know.
I have made her ill for your sake.

01:43:50.686 --> 01:43:54.231
So the least you can do is
get rid of that colourless youth!

01:43:56.692 --> 01:44:00.154
Haven't you had enough of
bullying women for the time being?

01:44:00.529 --> 01:44:03.574
I see I shall have to
make myself very plain.

01:44:03.907 --> 01:44:06.410
I have come to spend the night.

01:44:06.577 --> 01:44:09.746
I shall not take at all kindly
to being turned away.

01:44:10.873 --> 01:44:14.001
I am sorry.
I have made other arrangements.

01:44:15.711 --> 01:44:18.130
Yes, I knew there was something.

01:44:19.464 --> 01:44:20.382
What?

01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:28.307
Danceny isn't coming. Not tonight.

01:44:28.849 --> 01:44:31.059
What do you mean. How do you know?

01:44:34.479 --> 01:44:38.483
I know, because I have arranged
for him to spend the night with Cécile.

01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:46.283
Come to think of it,
he mentioned he was expected here.

01:44:46.783 --> 01:44:50.871
But, when I put it to him that he would
really have to make a choice...

01:44:50.954 --> 01:44:53.290
...I must say, he did not hesitate.

01:44:53.707 --> 01:44:57.294
He is coming to see you tomorrow,
to explain.

01:44:57.461 --> 01:44:59.880
And to offer you...

01:44:59.963 --> 01:45:02.591
- Do I have this right? Yes, I think I do. -

01:45:03.216 --> 01:45:04.968
...his eternal friendship.

01:45:05.636 --> 01:45:09.306
As you said, he is entirely devoted to you.

01:45:10.974 --> 01:45:12.684
That is enough, Vicomte.

01:45:13.143 --> 01:45:14.978
You are absolutely right.

01:45:16.813 --> 01:45:18.148
Shall we go up?

01:45:19.066 --> 01:45:21.151
Shall we, what?

01:45:21.401 --> 01:45:22.569
Go up.

01:45:22.653 --> 01:45:26.740
Unless you prefer this,
if memory serves, rather purgatorial sofa.

01:45:26.823 --> 01:45:29.743
- I think it is time you were leaving.
- No, I do not think so.

01:45:29.826 --> 01:45:32.996
We made an arrangement.
I really don't think I can allow myself...

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.041
...to be taken advantage of
for a moment longer.

01:45:36.333 --> 01:45:38.669
Remember,
I am better at this than you are.

01:45:38.752 --> 01:45:41.713
Perhaps. But it is always
the best swimmers who drown.

01:45:41.797 --> 01:45:43.757
Now, yes or no?

01:45:44.591 --> 01:45:46.259
It is up to you, of course.

01:45:46.343 --> 01:45:49.096
I will merely confine myself to remarking...

01:45:49.179 --> 01:45:52.683
...that a "no" will be regarded
as a declaration of war.

01:45:56.812 --> 01:45:59.940
A single word is all that is required.

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:04.528
All right.

01:46:08.824 --> 01:46:10.617
War!

01:46:33.974 --> 01:46:36.393
My dear Chevalier Danceny...

01:46:37.519 --> 01:46:42.190
... I understand you spent
last night with Cécile Volanges.

01:46:42.691 --> 01:46:46.403
I learnt this from her
more, regular lover...

01:46:47.195 --> 01:46:49.823
... the Vicomte de Valmont.

01:48:06.358 --> 01:48:09.027
I am dying because
I would not believe you.

01:49:56.801 --> 01:49:58.386
Fetch the surgeon.

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:00.054
No, no.

01:50:00.513 --> 01:50:01.973
Do as I say.

01:50:10.356 --> 01:50:11.983
A moment of your time.

01:50:16.321 --> 01:50:20.658
Two things: A word of advice,
which of course you may ignore, but...

01:50:21.159 --> 01:50:23.995
...it is honestly intended...

01:50:24.496 --> 01:50:26.039
...and a request...

01:50:27.248 --> 01:50:28.208
Go on.

01:50:29.667 --> 01:50:33.004
The advice is:
Be careful of the Marquise de Merteuil.

01:50:34.172 --> 01:50:36.758
You must permit me to treat
with scepticism...

01:50:36.841 --> 01:50:39.093
...anything you have to say about her.

01:50:39.177 --> 01:50:41.596
Nevertheless, I must tell you...

01:50:42.013 --> 01:50:45.350
...in this affair, we
are both her creatures...

01:50:50.688 --> 01:50:54.108
...as I believe her
letters to me will prove.

01:50:57.028 --> 01:51:00.949
When you have read them,
you may decide to circulate them.

01:51:05.370 --> 01:51:06.704
And the request?

01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:11.834
I want you somehow...

01:51:12.752 --> 01:51:14.003
...somehow...

01:51:14.587 --> 01:51:17.757
...to get to see Madame de Tourvel.

01:51:20.551 --> 01:51:22.512
I understand she is very ill.

01:51:22.637 --> 01:51:25.139
That is why this is most important to me.

01:51:28.142 --> 01:51:31.312
I want you to tell her
that I cannot explain...

01:51:31.854 --> 01:51:34.607
...why I broke with her as I did.

01:51:35.483 --> 01:51:39.737
But that since then,
my life has been worth nothing.

01:51:42.156 --> 01:51:45.785
I pushed the blade in deeper
than you just have my boy...

01:51:46.411 --> 01:51:49.163
...and now I need you
to help me withdraw it.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.336
Tell her it is lucky for her
that I have gone...

01:51:56.295 --> 01:51:59.382
...and I am glad not to have
to live without her.

01:52:01.259 --> 01:52:06.681
Tell her, her love was the only
real happiness that I have ever known.

01:52:11.728 --> 01:52:13.646
Will you do that for me?

01:52:14.731 --> 01:52:15.982
I will.

01:52:19.986 --> 01:52:22.363
It is all very well feeling sorry now.

01:52:23.197 --> 01:52:24.574
Let him be.

01:52:27.326 --> 01:52:29.203
He had good cause.

01:52:32.582 --> 01:52:38.379
I don't believe that's something anyone
has ever been able to say about me.

01:53:15.416 --> 01:53:16.584
Enough...

01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:22.423
Draw the curtains.

01:54:21.232 --> 01:54:23.526
Get out! Get out of here!
