00:01.000 --> 00:03.128
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:03.203 --> 00:05.535
All-Star catcher Jayson Turk
hit a foul ball

00:05.605 --> 00:07.971
which struck his coach
in the head, fatally.

00:08.074 --> 00:10.702
They've got his own wife
testifying against him.

00:10.777 --> 00:12.335
Thought wives couldn't
testify against husbands.

00:12.412 --> 00:14.505
Get down!
I've been seeing things lately.

00:14.581 --> 00:17.106
Starting to think they're
'cause of my aneurysm.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.310
Maybe I did the wrong thing
breaking up with her.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.616
Our client needs
a high-profile attorney.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.714
- Like it or not, Eli's profile keeps...
- Getting higher.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.021
- Taylor, stay as co-counsel.
- What?

00:27.093 --> 00:29.789
I see things now,
things that were always there,

00:29.863 --> 00:32.161
but that I just never noticed before.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.062
Today will be a good day.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.161
I can see the day being a good day.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.207
A very good day.

00:44.844 --> 00:47.904
"See it. Believe it. Achieve it. "

00:49.382 --> 00:51.646
There will be no
George Michael songs.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.278
There will be no
World War II battlefields.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.948
Fire-breathing dragons will not
take up residence in my closet.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.685
Ow!

01:05.265 --> 01:07.233
Oh, my God!

01:09.335 --> 01:10.996
Not the plasma!

01:12.672 --> 01:15.732
Earthquake! Earthquake!

01:18.545 --> 01:19.603
Nice duck.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.917
I'm not in the mood, Eli.

01:32.992 --> 01:36.860
Come on, Patti. An earthquake hits,
you only have time to save one thing.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.957
- What do you pick?
- A heavy blunt object to hit you with.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.868
I know better than to expect warm
cuddlies from you, but the past week,

01:44.938 --> 01:47.304
you've been treating me
worse than Jordan.

01:47.407 --> 01:51.173
Really? And what changed
a week ago, I wonder?

01:51.244 --> 01:53.371
Is this about Solinsky?

01:53.446 --> 01:56.609
It's about you representing
that scum-sucking lizard.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.877
If it bothers you so much,
say something.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.479
What? That you're lower than
Dick Cheney's bunion to be his lawyer?

02:02.555 --> 02:04.284
Come on, he's just a developer.

02:04.357 --> 02:07.918
Developing my friends and family
straight out of their homes. Why?

02:08.026 --> 02:09.961
So he can gentrify the neighborhood

02:10.029 --> 02:13.260
by building high-rise condos
around a retail destination.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.666
You mean malls, where
rich white people ride little trolleys

02:16.736 --> 02:20.297
from Pottery Barn to Barnes & Noble
so their rich feet don't get tired.

02:20.406 --> 02:24.103
I made a deal with Jordan. I take the
case, I get you back as my assistant.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.805
- Oh, I mean that much to you?
- Yes, you do.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.543
Then you shouldn't be helping somebody
bulldoze my old neighborhood!

02:36.289 --> 02:40.020
- Hey. What's going on?
- Uh... Let's see.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.994
Another celeb got photographed
getting out of her car

02:43.062 --> 02:45.030
without her panties on, and I think...

02:45.131 --> 02:47.691
No, with you.
You've been acting weird all week.

02:47.767 --> 02:50.031
And I mean weird for you,
which is weird.

02:50.770 --> 02:54.331
I'm fine. But thanks
for your show of gentle concern.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.068
- You've been avoiding me.
- We're talking now,

02:57.143 --> 02:59.202
so I'm not really doing
a good job of it.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.008
Maggie, you've been acting strange

03:01.080 --> 03:03.207
- ever since the kiss.
- Shh!

03:03.283 --> 03:05.444
Why don't you just put it
on a billboard?

03:05.552 --> 03:09.648
Look, first of all, I'm not acting
strange or weird since...

03:10.657 --> 03:12.591
...the thing.
- The thing?

03:12.659 --> 03:16.925
Second of all, I'm not even thinking
about the thing. I have a boyfriend.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.290
OK, great. 'Cause it seemed
like you were upset.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.868
- I'm fine. I'm just...
- Eli?

03:22.936 --> 03:25.700
I wanted to talk to you
before we met with Solinsky,

03:25.805 --> 03:26.965
but I'm interrupting.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.735
- You're interrupting nothing.
- No. Nothing.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.446
Let's go.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.544
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.883
We the jury,
in the above entitled action,

03:41.955 --> 03:44.287
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

03:44.357 --> 03:48.020
find the defendant,
Jayson Christopher Turk, not guilty.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.027
- What happens next?
- In real life?

03:51.097 --> 03:54.430
In real life, you'd be found
not guilty by temporary insanity.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.459
Diminished capacity defense
as a result of your steroid use.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.337
- And you do probation for a year.
- What about the League?

04:02.442 --> 04:04.569
Could go either way,
but you're the best catcher.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.078
- Hall of Fame, though?
- I'm sorry.

04:07.146 --> 04:11.105
- Thinking about the Hall of Fame?
- Yeah. I've dedicated my life to that,

04:11.184 --> 04:13.482
and you guys have got me
saying I'm a juicer.

04:13.553 --> 04:17.579
That's the most effective means of
winning, as these mock trials proved.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.750
I'm going on trial for murder tomorrow.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.793
Which is why I'm stepping in now.

04:21.861 --> 04:25.024
Your client's worried the cure
might be worse than the disease.

04:25.131 --> 04:28.100
Nothing worse than
maximum security for 25 to life.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.499
Nobody cares about
your Hall of Fame status

04:30.570 --> 04:32.697
when it's lights out on Cellblock B.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.771
You with them on this?

04:40.680 --> 04:46.641
Yeah. Because you
don't have any other options.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.155
- This doesn't have to be difficult.
- Of course not.

04:54.227 --> 04:57.890
We're two adults who had a relationship
now over by mutual agreement.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.728
No betrayal. No recrimination.

05:00.833 --> 05:04.325
No alienation of affection.
Just an acknowledgement...

05:04.404 --> 05:06.634
That it would be best if we were apart.

05:07.774 --> 05:11.938
Except for the fact that Solinsky and
your father are making us work together.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.275
You review the city council transcripts?

05:14.347 --> 05:17.680
They approved the taking
of Silver Terrace by eminent domain.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.218
Unanimous... Taylor, do you feel that?

05:31.431 --> 05:32.557
No, you don't.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.101
Whoa!

05:47.246 --> 05:48.736
I never did that.

06:19.011 --> 06:20.979
Do I feel what, Eli?

06:22.548 --> 06:25.915
How great us working together
is going to be.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.978
Literally.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.627
As if I don't
have enough problems,

06:35.695 --> 06:38.721
now I'm getting serenaded
by my ex and Maggie.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.961
Last time I checked, two seriously
hot women singing to you,

06:42.068 --> 06:45.037
- not really a problem.
- It is if you work with both of them.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.629
I must say, their singing
was surprisingly good.

06:47.707 --> 06:50.676
Love triangle portion,
figure out with your therapist.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.337
Let's talk about these
recurring earthquakes.

06:53.446 --> 06:56.006
For the past months,
my life's been falling apart.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.140
Now everything else is falling apart.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.583
Visions aren't
a commentary on your life.

07:00.653 --> 07:04.783
In Norse mythology, earthquakes
were the result of Loki's punishment.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.917
Have you done anything lately
you should be punished for?

07:07.994 --> 07:09.859
Back on the side of evil this week.

07:09.929 --> 07:13.057
Representing a developer
who's tearing down Silver Terrace.

07:13.132 --> 07:14.656
Solinsky? That guy's a pig.

07:14.734 --> 07:18.192
If you don't mind, I'm already
getting an earful from Patti.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.037
- Lie down.
- Is it needle time? I love needle time.

07:22.141 --> 07:25.304
You're never allowed to call it
"needle time" again.

07:25.411 --> 07:29.177
Now, I should be able to help you
relive your earthquake vision.

07:29.248 --> 07:33.014
Like under hypnosis. Maybe you
can notice some additional details.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.521
- If not, I just clear your sinuses.
- Maybe I can save the plasma.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.259
Ow!

07:42.695 --> 07:46.597
God! Oh, my God!

07:46.666 --> 07:48.634
Plasma! My plasma!

07:50.837 --> 07:53.863
- Yeah!
- Programming for this report.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.431
Bay Area is experiencing
a major earthquake

07:56.509 --> 07:59.000
measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.

07:59.078 --> 08:02.775
The epicenter of the quake
is located in Silver Terrace.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.943
- We'll have much more...
- There was a news report.

08:06.018 --> 08:08.714
Silver Terrace gets destroyed
by an earthquake.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.517
Did it say when?

08:10.590 --> 08:14.287
No, just that
it's the epicenter of a 6.5.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.987
So if you lose this case...

08:17.330 --> 08:19.298
Those people could die.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.110
Call Solinsky, I want
to meet with him right away.

08:38.183 --> 08:42.484
Get Jeffrey Powell, I want to negotiate
a settlement on the Silver Terrace case.

08:42.554 --> 08:45.991
- Going to make this right.
- Still representing Arvin Solinsky?

08:46.058 --> 08:47.218
- Yes.
- Still helping

08:47.293 --> 08:50.456
take my friends' and families' homes
and tear down my church?

08:50.563 --> 08:53.191
- Yes, but...
- So, by "make this right,"

08:53.266 --> 08:57.032
you mean you do the same exact thing
you were doing before,

08:57.103 --> 08:58.832
but with greater urgency?

08:59.839 --> 09:03.605
- Yes, but...
- Oh, make your own damn calls.

09:09.515 --> 09:10.607
We need to talk.

09:10.683 --> 09:14.210
- We've already talked.
- No. We didn't "talk" talk.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.050
We "talk" talked enough for me.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.522
Can I please go back to avoiding you
and pretending like I'm not?

09:19.625 --> 09:23.391
Look, either you're a closet Carole King
fan or you have a thing for me.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.388
Who's Carole King?

09:27.199 --> 09:28.928
So, you don't...

09:29.001 --> 09:30.559
You don't have a crush on me?

09:30.670 --> 09:33.298
Not before, but that
kind of modesty is a turn-on.

09:34.407 --> 09:39.140
Fine. I'm wrong.
Believe me, I'm glad to be wrong.

09:41.080 --> 09:45.949
Maggie, since my diagnosis,
my life's gotten really complicated.

09:46.018 --> 09:49.317
And I can't deal with
any more complications.

09:49.388 --> 09:52.949
We work together. You report to me.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.995
Nothing romantic
could ever happen between us.

09:59.365 --> 10:03.131
- You know that, right?
- Yeah. Of course, I do.

10:03.202 --> 10:06.569
Eli. You came by my office?

10:11.143 --> 10:14.010
She... Her keyboard jammed.

10:18.985 --> 10:24.321
Jayson Turk committed a crime.
Intentionally, with malice aforethought,

10:24.390 --> 10:26.255
he killed another human being.

10:26.325 --> 10:30.591
In front of 30,000 fans and hundreds
of cameras? Does that sound reasonable?

10:30.663 --> 10:35.032
Or does it sound like a man who's in
an altered state and out of his mind?

10:35.101 --> 10:37.592
He wasn't out of his mind
when he used steroids

10:37.670 --> 10:41.800
to bulk up to 245 pounds
of solid muscle.

10:41.874 --> 10:46.243
Those same steroids altered his mental
state, rendering him temporarily...

10:46.345 --> 10:49.610
Insane? Please.
Let's just call it what it is:

10:49.682 --> 10:52.048
Another excuse to let Jayson Turk

10:52.151 --> 10:54.312
- get away with criminal behavior.
- Celebrities...

10:54.387 --> 10:56.412
No more entitled to break the law...

10:56.489 --> 10:58.855
No less deserving of
presumption of innocence...

10:58.924 --> 11:01.757
- Than you or me.
- While steroid use is against the law,

11:01.827 --> 11:06.059
Jayson Turk isn't being prosecuted
for that. He's on trial for murder.

11:06.132 --> 11:09.499
And, on that charge, he is innocent.

11:09.602 --> 11:13.163
Mr. Solinsky, 20 million dollars'd
make this lawsuit disappear.

11:13.239 --> 11:17.175
Still trying to wrap my brain around
the idea the neighborhood can sue me.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.211
And now you want me to settle?

11:19.278 --> 11:22.247
Settling avoids a trial,
which could delay construction,

11:22.348 --> 11:26.079
- in this case, destruction, for months.
- City's paying for the properties.

11:26.152 --> 11:29.883
I'm suggesting you pay more so
they drop their suit and move out.

11:29.955 --> 11:33.823
It's better to weigh the pros
and cons of settlement before trial.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.760
The con would be
I pay the denizens of Silver Terrace

11:36.829 --> 11:39.297
20 million dollars out of my own pocket.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.061
- I'm not seeing the pro.
- Doing the right thing.

11:43.135 --> 11:47.629
The right thing? I'm turning an
urban blight into a clean, safe place.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.835
Citizens who live there won't
be able to afford to park there.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.207
- Eli.
- I'm sorry,

11:52.278 --> 11:55.179
but this is how Silver Terrace's lawyer
is gonna paint you.

11:55.247 --> 11:57.772
Right now, people still think
you're a good guy.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.978
Which I'm sure is true, Arv. But...

12:01.053 --> 12:04.147
This trial will be
very bad for that perception.

12:07.993 --> 12:11.861
- You don't look that happy.
- It's not an overwhelming amount.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.593
It's three times
what the city already paid.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.727
Which wasn't very much to begin with.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.237
I don't know what Mr. Powell
has promised you,

12:20.306 --> 12:22.934
but are you willing to bet
20 million he's right?

12:26.545 --> 12:29.708
We'd get this money on top of
what the city already paid us?

12:29.815 --> 12:32.750
Those checks can't compensate
for the loss of the homes

12:32.818 --> 12:35.878
you raised your children in,
your grandchildren in.

12:35.955 --> 12:38.515
The city says it can
take away your community

12:38.591 --> 12:40.456
because the neighborhood is lost.

12:40.526 --> 12:43.461
Take this money and
you're agreeing with them.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.837
I think you can tell your client
his offer is rejected.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.568
What were you doing back there?

12:55.641 --> 12:58.769
Trying to undo Powell's
"power to the people" brainwashing.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.608
- Arvin Solinsky, please.
- What are you doing now?

13:01.680 --> 13:05.844
I think I can get them to take
25 million. It's Eli Stone calling.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.853
Or it was. That was me
making a call to Arvin.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.481
To our client,
to put up another five million.

13:11.557 --> 13:14.219
- Can cover it out of petty cash.
- It's malpractice

13:14.293 --> 13:17.126
to shove a settlement down his throat?
What's going on?

13:17.196 --> 13:20.427
- We can win this at trial.
- A trial will take too long.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.434
- Solinsky can wait.
- I can't. They can't.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.299
Eli, what is happening?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.504
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.108
My visions...

13:38.250 --> 13:43.017
...they guide me. They tell me
what kinds of cases I should take.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.818
- Or what I should do.
- Eli. That's...

13:45.891 --> 13:48.985
Crazy, yeah, but it's the truth.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.364
I saw myself
take my dad's ashes to India.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.458
I saw Jake McCann
die last month before it happened.

13:56.535 --> 14:01.268
And two days ago I saw Silver Terrace
get destroyed by an earthquake.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.867
- If we don't get these people out...
- These things you're seeing

14:04.944 --> 14:08.710
- are symptoms of your aneurysm.
- I wish they were.

14:08.814 --> 14:10.782
You need to get help.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.719
That's not the kind of help
I need right now.

14:30.302 --> 14:33.066
Jayson and I have been
married for five years.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.368
Obviously, it wasn't a perfect marriage.

14:35.441 --> 14:38.501
No, there've been infidelities
on both sides.

14:38.577 --> 14:42.741
Jayson had his baseball groupies
in I don't know how many cities.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.511
And, for the past six months,

14:45.584 --> 14:50.521
I had been involved with Jon Quesada,
his third base coach.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.956
Why do you believe your husband
murdered Jon Quesada?

14:54.026 --> 14:55.960
Sidebar, Judge.

14:56.228 --> 15:00.665
Trying to elicit testimony that the
defendant threatened the victim's life.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.201
Mr. Sweren needs to be reminded
what's said between

15:03.269 --> 15:05.829
- husband and wife is privileged.
- I'm good, thanks.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.701
Mrs. Turk can speak to Mr. Turk's

15:07.773 --> 15:11.539
- character and capacity for murder.
- Agreed.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.407
Objection overruled. Step back.

15:19.752 --> 15:24.883
Mrs. Turk, can you explain to the jury
why you think he committed murder?

15:24.957 --> 15:26.925
Jayson is a jealous man.

15:27.026 --> 15:30.792
He's possessive, insecure. He won't
permit me to have male friends.

15:30.896 --> 15:34.923
- Was he this way before steroids?
- Yes. It is who the man is.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.134
Did Jayson ever raise a hand to you?

15:43.208 --> 15:45.676
- No.
- What about fights, barroom brawls?

15:45.744 --> 15:47.837
No. Jealousy is Jayson's hot button.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.746
You also had affairs with
Gerrit Wilson, Jim Wacker.

15:50.816 --> 15:55.651
- Where might those men be buried?
- They are still alive.

15:55.721 --> 15:59.282
Maybe because you had those affairs
before Jayson started steroids.

16:06.031 --> 16:09.592
For what it's worth, I'm sorry
I sprung this on you before trial.

16:09.668 --> 16:13.229
Moving forward, I insist that
any further changes in strategy

16:13.339 --> 16:16.433
- be run through me first.
- I'm not crazy, Taylor.

16:18.677 --> 16:21.942
- Patti. What are you doing here?
- My civic duty.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.244
- Powell subpoenaed you?
- Yep.

16:24.316 --> 16:28.810
He thinks I'll make a very
convincing witness, and I tend to agree.

16:31.690 --> 16:35.057
What was it like to grow up
in Silver Terrace, Miss Dellacroix?

16:35.127 --> 16:38.585
No one had a lot,
but what we had, we shared.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.963
If you were short on grocery money,
the church helped out.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.968
If your gas was going to be cut off,

16:44.036 --> 16:48.530
neighbors chipped in to pay the bills.
That spirit is still there.

16:48.607 --> 16:51.235
You just have to look past
the peeling paint.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.868
Objection. Relevance?

16:52.945 --> 16:56.972
City exercised eminent domain 'cause
it designated Silver Terrace a blight.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.677
I'm exploring the veracity
of that determination.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.721
- Objection overruled.
- Back to the peeling paint.

17:02.821 --> 17:06.257
- What did you mean by that?
- The neighborhood has its problems,

17:06.325 --> 17:09.657
but it's still a long way
from being written off for dead.

17:10.628 --> 17:13.496
Thank you, Miss Dellacroix.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.900
Pat...

17:17.970 --> 17:23.670
Miss Dellacroix, under the law,
"blighted" has a specific legal meaning.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.676
- Do you know what it is?
- Objection, condescending.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.109
It was not.

17:28.180 --> 17:32.048
I've been a legal secretary since
you were an itch in your daddy's pants.

17:32.117 --> 17:36.281
I know an objectionable question
when I hear one.

17:36.355 --> 17:40.416
Miss Dellacroix, could we leave
the objecting to Mr. Powell, please?

17:40.492 --> 17:43.359
Of course. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.931
How would you compare Silver Terrace...

17:50.002 --> 17:53.233
Objection, speculative.
I could not let that stand, Judge.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.701
Maybe it'd better if I did
the cross-examination.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.371
You think you'll have
better luck, by all means.

18:04.049 --> 18:08.611
If Silver Terrace is so alive with
community spirit, why'd you move away?

18:08.720 --> 18:12.622
I wanted a shorter commute to work,
but it is still my church home.

18:12.691 --> 18:16.457
When was the last time
you were in Silver Terrace?

18:18.163 --> 18:20.631
Time flies. I really don't remember.

18:20.699 --> 18:24.533
Do you remember getting carjacked
down the street from the church?

18:26.205 --> 18:29.174
Guess without a car,
you really did need a shorter commute.

18:37.916 --> 18:41.852
- Judge, you wanted to see me?
- Mr. Stone. Walk with me.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.981
This isn't ex parte because
it's not about the case. It's about you.

18:46.058 --> 18:49.687
Obviously, I've heard about
your recent trouble with the Bar.

18:49.761 --> 18:52.321
I guess you haven't
been living under a rock.

18:52.397 --> 18:55.764
Obviously, I'm concerned
you might use your illness

18:55.834 --> 18:59.531
as an excuse for some of that
unusual behavior I hear you're prone to.

18:59.605 --> 19:02.836
- I would never do that, Your Honor.
- Good.

19:02.908 --> 19:07.368
I admire your client, Solinsky.
He is a self-made man.

19:07.446 --> 19:10.313
My son-in-law is a
wannabe developer in San Diego.

19:10.382 --> 19:14.478
I imagine it would mean the world to him
to partner with an "Arvin Solinsky. "

19:14.553 --> 19:18.284
Unfortunately, there's only one
and he happens to be my client, so...

19:18.357 --> 19:22.623
There's a project he could get off the
ground if he had Solinsky as a partner.

19:23.328 --> 19:27.458
I can't tell you how appreciative
I'd be if you introduced my son-in-law

19:27.533 --> 19:30.468
to Mr. Solinsky.
After the case is over, of course.

19:30.536 --> 19:34.802
I'm sorry, Judge. I don't enjoy that
kind of relationship with Mr. Solinsky.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.933
- Are you sure about that?
- I am, sir.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.173
I'm also sure your request
is a serious breach of ethics.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.544
Considering your trouble with the Bar,

19:43.615 --> 19:47.073
who do you think
they're going to believe, me or you?

19:47.286 --> 19:52.383
Forget I said anything.
You have a good afternoon, Mr. Stone.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.459
You too, sir.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.098
I guess it's a question
of what I'm willing to do to win.

20:09.174 --> 20:12.200
This case isn't about
winning or losing, Eli.

20:12.277 --> 20:17.408
No, it's about "saving lives
and being a prophet, God's go-to guy. "

20:17.482 --> 20:20.042
For someone touched by divinity,
you whine a lot.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.643
Possibly touched by
a theoretical divinity.

20:22.721 --> 20:27.283
And bribing a judge doesn't really sound
like a plan God would come up with.

20:27.359 --> 20:30.487
Moses was running from the law
when he saw the burning bush.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.395
Martin Luther broke the law
by translating the Bible.

20:33.465 --> 20:36.730
Martin Luther King broke
a bunch of laws in civil disobedience.

20:36.802 --> 20:40.238
For that matter, so did Gandhi
who, by the way, was also a lawyer.

20:40.305 --> 20:44.071
- Sorry. I'm not breaking any laws.
- I'd never tell you to break the law.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.303
Aren't you?

20:49.381 --> 20:52.873
- Eli?
- We got to get out of here!

20:52.951 --> 20:55.511
No, we don't. It's all in your...

21:03.328 --> 21:06.058
Patti! Patti!

21:07.032 --> 21:09.398
Dude, you've got to calm down.

21:15.974 --> 21:19.501
You OK? I've never seen you when
you're having one of your visions.

21:19.578 --> 21:22.945
It's intense, bro.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.146
Eli.

21:26.251 --> 21:27.775
Eli!

21:29.655 --> 21:32.715
- Remember how I was hearing music?
- Think I could forget?

21:32.791 --> 21:35.658
- You might not believe this part.
- Just this part?

21:37.496 --> 21:39.987
Sometimes I have visions of the future.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.933
Am I being punk'd?

21:43.001 --> 21:45.868
Is that cute Ashton Kutcher
going to jump out here?

21:45.937 --> 21:48.030
I hear he appreciates the mature woman.

21:48.106 --> 21:51.667
Patti, ever since my aneurysm,
I've had certain gifts.

21:51.743 --> 21:54.576
This some lame attempt
to get me to stop being mad at you?

21:54.646 --> 21:56.546
No. I swear.

21:57.816 --> 22:01.775
I saw an earthquake
and it destroys Silver Terrace.

22:01.887 --> 22:05.846
That's why I'm helping Solinsky.
I have to get your former neighbors out.

22:07.459 --> 22:11.793
Eli. If you are running a
game on me, so help me God...

22:11.863 --> 22:14.229
No, actually, it's God
I'm trying to help.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.302
That's who I think
these visions are from.

22:18.603 --> 22:21.470
Even if you think I'm nuts,
it doesn't change the fact

22:21.540 --> 22:24.168
Solinsky's settlement deal
is a good one.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.839
Why would the association listen to me?

22:26.912 --> 22:31.076
You're part of the community. They trust
you. You can get them to take the deal.

22:32.484 --> 22:35.749
- Eli, I...
- I know. I could be crazy.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.789
But what if I'm not?

22:40.692 --> 22:44.059
I wasn't in my right mind.
I don't even remember it happening.

22:44.162 --> 22:47.131
- Aiming to hit Jon Quesada?
- Any of it.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.001
I remember looking down third base
where Jon was and...

22:51.970 --> 22:54.666
...and I snapped.
- When you say you "snapped"...

22:54.740 --> 22:57.231
I got angry. It started in my gut,

22:57.309 --> 23:00.244
and it spread until I could
taste the bile in my mouth.

23:00.312 --> 23:03.645
And the next thing, my head
is spinning, and after that...

23:03.715 --> 23:06.275
I honestly couldn't tell you
what happened next.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.852
I can. You hit a line drive
straight at Jon Quesada's head.

23:11.957 --> 23:14.425
I know. I saw the tape.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.961
That's hard when you're
not in your right mind.

23:17.028 --> 23:18.723
Counsel asking us or telling us?

23:18.797 --> 23:22.289
Were you taking performance enhancing
drugs at the time Jon Quesada died?

23:22.367 --> 23:24.801
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

23:24.870 --> 23:28.033
I'll ask it another way.
Let me see if I've got this straight:

23:28.140 --> 23:31.632
The steroids, which you conveniently
won't admit to taking,

23:31.710 --> 23:35.476
put you in a rage,
which conveniently killed the man

23:35.547 --> 23:39.916
who was having an affair with your wife,
which conveniently you can't recall now.

23:40.018 --> 23:44.284
I'm sitting in this chair
on trial for my life, Mr. Sweren.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.291
There isn't anything convenient
about this for me.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.725
Redirect, Your Honor.

23:52.798 --> 23:57.132
Mr. Turk, Jon Quesada was sleeping
with your wife and you knew about it.

23:57.202 --> 23:59.227
Do you expect this jury to believe

23:59.304 --> 24:02.432
that what befell him
was just an unfortunate accident?

24:03.842 --> 24:07.471
Obviously, some part of me
wanted to end the man.

24:09.915 --> 24:14.011
But, I swear to God, I never
intended to do him any harm.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.417
The defense rests, Your Honor.

24:17.489 --> 24:20.617
The people intend to call
a rebuttal witness, Your Honor.

24:20.692 --> 24:21.989
- Who?
- Carly Turk.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.527
Sidebar, Your Honor.

24:24.629 --> 24:28.725
I fail to see how Ms. Turk can elaborate
on the testimony she's already given.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.964
Unless the DA's circumventing spousal
privilege and get Mr. Turk's threat in.

24:33.038 --> 24:34.869
- Suspicious?
- Suspicious a lot.

24:34.940 --> 24:39.468
Cut it out. If Mr. Sweren wants
to recall a witness, I can't stop him.

24:39.544 --> 24:44.777
But, if Carly Turk so much as repeats
what the defendant mumbled in his sleep,

24:44.850 --> 24:47.284
I'm holding you in contempt.

24:50.121 --> 24:53.579
- What's going on?
- Powell called, he wanted a meeting.

24:54.793 --> 24:58.627
- Which one of you got to my clients?
- What are you talking about, Jeff?

24:58.697 --> 25:03.361
The residents of Silver Terrace had a
sudden and inexplicable change of heart.

25:03.435 --> 25:07.565
They'd like to accept Mr. Solinsky's
offer and dismiss the case.

25:09.441 --> 25:11.705
Could we have a moment with our client?

25:18.049 --> 25:20.210
- I don't think we should settle.
- What?

25:20.318 --> 25:23.810
This is the same offer we were
willing to make three days ago.

25:23.889 --> 25:27.450
- You said the offer was a good idea.
- When it'd avoid going to trial.

25:27.559 --> 25:29.652
But, we're here, I think we can win.

25:29.728 --> 25:32.219
Chances of winning are 50l50, at best.

25:32.297 --> 25:35.130
And I can't recommend
a 20 million dollar payout

25:35.200 --> 25:37.930
on top of attorney's fees
you're incurring with those odds.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.164
- You're right.
- Mr. Solinsky...

25:40.238 --> 25:44.402
Eli, I know you want to settle
and I respect your point of view.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.842
But, Taylor's right.
If they wanted a check,

25:46.912 --> 25:51.474
they should've taken the money while
they had the chance. Thanks, Taylor.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.754
- Taylor, what the hell?
- I know you're angry.

25:57.822 --> 26:00.655
But, I am looking out
for our client's best interest,

26:00.725 --> 26:04.252
not trying to evacuate Silver Terrace
because I can see the future.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.831
Eli!

26:08.400 --> 26:11.062
OK, now we have to win this in court.

26:11.836 --> 26:15.602
- I'm glad we're on the same page.
- You can tell Arvin I'll be closing.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.265
Not sure that's a good idea.

26:17.342 --> 26:20.038
Even if you don't believe
these people are in danger,

26:20.111 --> 26:21.806
believe that I believe it.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.508
So, between us,
who wants to win this thing more?

26:26.318 --> 26:30.152
All he ever wanted to do was win.
I think he felt like he had to compete

26:30.221 --> 26:32.189
with the other players who were juicing.

26:32.290 --> 26:37.421
To your knowledge, was he taking
steroids on the day Jon Quesada died?

26:38.396 --> 26:40.728
I saw him give himself two injections.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.768
Immediately, his mood changed.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.396
But he still seemed
in control of his actions.

26:47.472 --> 26:49.906
He was very angry.
His temper was flaring.

26:49.975 --> 26:53.741
- Were you in fear for your safety?
- No.

26:53.812 --> 26:56.713
I was afraid for Jon.
Jayson said he was going to kill him.

26:56.781 --> 26:59.841
- Mrs. Turk!
- Move for an immediate mistrial.

26:59.918 --> 27:02.648
Clear the courtroom now.

27:02.721 --> 27:06.088
A privileged conversation,
the contents are prejudicial.

27:06.191 --> 27:08.125
I told her not to break privilege!

27:08.193 --> 27:10.753
- Sure you did.
- There's no reason for a mistrial.

27:10.829 --> 27:13.696
The jury can be instructed
to ignore the statement.

27:13.765 --> 27:18.099
No instruction could persuade a jury
to ignore that statement.

27:18.169 --> 27:23.197
I hate granting mistrials
almost as much as I hate unfair trials.

27:23.274 --> 27:26.334
If you declare a mistrial,
Jayson can't be tried again.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.936
- Double jeopardy.
- Doesn't apply in a mistrial.

27:29.014 --> 27:32.381
Does when the mistrial arises
out of prosecutorial misconduct.

27:32.450 --> 27:36.409
- He's set on winning any way he can.
- Court grants immunity against slander,

27:36.488 --> 27:37.921
doesn't mean I won't file.

27:37.989 --> 27:41.152
You boys take a ruler to the men's room
and measure yourself, fine,

27:41.226 --> 27:43.990
but keep it out of my courtroom.

27:44.062 --> 27:46.223
I want to talk to Carly Turk.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.560
Then I'll make my ruling.

27:48.633 --> 27:51.602
Arvin Solinsky, pillar of the community.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.798
Just not the community
he's trying to bulldoze.

27:57.242 --> 28:00.541
Talking to yourself? Not a good sign.

28:00.612 --> 28:02.580
Neither is the fact I'm going to choke

28:02.647 --> 28:04.877
on the biggest closing
in my entire life.

28:04.949 --> 28:07.076
Don't you think that's overdramatic?

28:07.152 --> 28:11.111
- It's real estate, not life and death.
- You'd be surprised.

28:18.830 --> 28:22.129
- What is it, Eli?
- I can't tell you.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.466
If I tell you, you're going to think
I'm insane. Just like everyone else.

28:26.538 --> 28:30.235
Maybe. But I can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

28:34.145 --> 28:37.273
If I don't win this case,
the people of Silver Terrace,

28:37.348 --> 28:39.816
or at least a lot of them,

28:39.884 --> 28:44.253
- are going to die in an earthquake.
- How do you know they'll die?

28:44.355 --> 28:46.323
Don't ask me how I know, I just do.

28:48.493 --> 28:51.758
- OK.
- "OK?"

28:53.598 --> 28:57.159
- You believe me?
- Why wouldn't I?

28:59.337 --> 29:01.396
Well, I don't know.
Because someone saying

29:01.473 --> 29:04.840
they can see the future is ludicrous.

29:05.376 --> 29:08.345
Well, good thing
you didn't just tell you.

29:10.181 --> 29:12.046
You really believe me?

29:13.585 --> 29:16.418
I'm not saying you can see the future.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.520
But, since I've gotten to know you,

29:19.591 --> 29:22.560
you've been nothing
but honest and sincere.

29:23.828 --> 29:26.194
And, yeah, totally obnoxious.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.934
But, if you tell me something,
I believe it's true.

29:37.742 --> 29:39.266
I told my brother,

29:39.344 --> 29:42.245
I told Patti,

29:42.313 --> 29:43.974
Taylor...

29:44.048 --> 29:45.811
None of them believe me.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.746
You didn't even hesitate.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.117
You know, you're pretty amazing.

30:02.500 --> 30:05.060
- Eli, no.
- I'm sorry.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.695
Look, you can't have it both ways, Eli.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.706
You said nothing could happen.

30:09.774 --> 30:13.335
- I know I did. I'm sorry.
- So we agreed there's a line.

30:14.345 --> 30:17.075
Please, just stop crossing it.

30:27.826 --> 30:32.456
The rule of double jeopardy,
that a defendant cannot be tried twice,

30:32.530 --> 30:35.021
does not apply
in the case of a mistrial.

30:35.099 --> 30:39.433
Except when the mistrial is
the result of prosecutorial misconduct,

30:39.504 --> 30:44.032
as alleged by the defense here.
I've spoken privately with Mrs. Turk,

30:44.108 --> 30:46.804
and she confessed to me that

30:46.878 --> 30:50.905
her spontaneous outburst of
privileged information was, in fact,

30:50.982 --> 30:54.474
a planned statement coached
by the Assistant District Attorney.

30:54.552 --> 30:57.521
- Your Honor, she's lying!
- She's your witness, counsel.

30:57.622 --> 31:01.956
And you don't want to be ticking me off
any more than I already am.

31:04.495 --> 31:08.989
I'm finding there was prosecutorial
misconduct in this case,

31:09.067 --> 31:13.527
jeopardy attaches, and the
defendant cannot be tried again.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.540
Accordingly, this matter
is dismissed with prejudice.

31:16.608 --> 31:19.236
Mr. Turk, see probation,
then you're free to go.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.744
Mr. Turk?

31:24.849 --> 31:28.182
Bigger than the World Series,
Mr. Wethersby. Bigger.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.454
Congratulations, man.

31:33.524 --> 31:34.786
Ready for the cameras?

31:34.859 --> 31:37.419
The term "born ready" comes to mind.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.906
Going back to baseball.
I feel wonderful.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.946
Now that the evidence is closed,
if there's no objection,

31:56.014 --> 31:59.643
- I'm ready to render my decision.
- Don't want to hear final arguments?

31:59.717 --> 32:03.585
I don't believe they'll materially
affect my ruling, Mr. Powell.

32:04.055 --> 32:06.956
The Supreme Court has ruled
that expanding tax revenue

32:07.025 --> 32:08.287
is in public interest,

32:08.359 --> 32:12.728
and city officials have decided that's
what Mr. Solinsky's project will do.

32:12.797 --> 32:15.231
If this is not what
residents of the city want,

32:15.300 --> 32:17.962
they can vote their elected
representatives out.

32:18.036 --> 32:20.596
But I am bound to uphold their decision.

32:21.172 --> 32:23.140
Judgment for the defendant.

32:23.207 --> 32:27.234
The TRO is hereby lifted
and I'm issuing a minute order

32:27.312 --> 32:29.837
instructing the residents
of Silver Terrace

32:29.914 --> 32:33.782
to vacate with all deliberate speed.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.684
Where am I supposed to go?

32:44.896 --> 32:48.127
All right. Sign here and initial here.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.862
That's it.

32:50.935 --> 32:54.701
Your major league suspension's
officially lifted. Batter up.

32:55.406 --> 32:57.704
Thanks, bro.

32:57.775 --> 33:01.267
Before we're done,
I brought you a little something.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.174
A head start on the divorce pleading

33:07.251 --> 33:09.685
before Carly had time
to hide any assets.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.916
It's just another signature.

33:22.433 --> 33:26.802
Look, guys. I think we're
going to try to work it out.

33:26.871 --> 33:30.136
- There's still love there, you know?
- No, I don't.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.768
She cheated on you
and tried to stick you in prison.

33:32.877 --> 33:35.437
How much love could
we be talking about here?

33:35.546 --> 33:39.243
The DA didn't conspire with Carly
to blurt out the threat, did he?

33:39.317 --> 33:44.186
She conspired with you. You're worth
more on the outside than on the inside.

33:44.255 --> 33:45.222
Smart.

33:45.323 --> 33:49.350
All she had to do was have a spontaneous
outburst and say Sweren coached her.

33:49.427 --> 33:54.194
You get a mistrial,
jeopardy attaches, you walk clean.

33:56.501 --> 34:00.631
You know why you loved that
'roid rage defense so much?

34:00.705 --> 34:03.401
Because it fit your picture
of who I was.

34:03.474 --> 34:06.568
You thought I was stupid.
You were wrong.

34:06.644 --> 34:10.670
I should have seen it. Sweren may be
a bottom-feeder, but he's not a cheater.

34:10.748 --> 34:12.716
You are.

34:12.817 --> 34:15.842
Rules are for other people, right?

34:15.920 --> 34:20.482
I was about to lose everything.
Great players perform under pressure.

34:20.591 --> 34:23.286
I did what I had to do.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.726
- We done?
- Oh, yeah.

34:26.630 --> 34:27.757
We're done.

34:33.371 --> 34:36.806
Thanks, bro. I couldn't have
done this without you.

34:44.949 --> 34:48.248
Now would not be a good time
to say "I told you so. "

34:48.319 --> 34:52.755
Actually, it is.
You fought me this whole time.

34:52.824 --> 34:56.123
I was the bad guy for not getting
on the Jayson Turk bandwagon.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.095
If it had been any other guy,
same set of facts,

34:59.163 --> 35:02.929
- we would've been on the same page.
- I'm a jerk because I believed him.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.628
No. You're a jerk because
you didn't believe me.

35:07.538 --> 35:11.269
Makes you feel better, people'll figure
it out when they see him with Carly.

35:11.342 --> 35:14.072
I'm not the only person
who can add two plus two.

35:14.145 --> 35:17.842
No. No, he'll get away with it.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.311
That's what he does.

35:24.188 --> 35:26.418
Congratulations.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.355
To you, too.

35:29.427 --> 35:32.157
I'm not sure I had
anything to do with it.

35:33.831 --> 35:36.925
Do you have any idea why Arvin
asked me for the phone number

35:37.001 --> 35:39.231
of Judge Salese's son-in-law?

35:41.772 --> 35:42.932
No idea.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.100
That's funny, because Arvin
said you would.

35:46.177 --> 35:48.611
Something about a meeting you arranged?

35:48.679 --> 35:50.840
He was under the assumption I knew.

35:57.655 --> 36:00.715
Eli, tell me you didn't do
anything crazy to win this case.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.055
You know, now's
really not a good time.

36:03.127 --> 36:06.096
I promised Maggie I'd
proof her summary judgment motion.

36:06.197 --> 36:08.563
I suppose you'll be
catching a flight to Ohio.

36:08.633 --> 36:12.125
She sent out an office-wide e-mail.
She went home to Ohio for a week.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.933
I guess you don't know
anything about that, either.

36:23.881 --> 36:26.008
- Patti.
- I just want you to know,

36:26.083 --> 36:28.313
I'm not coming back
into the office today.

36:28.386 --> 36:30.513
- Where are you?
- My church.

36:30.588 --> 36:33.148
You know, the one
you're getting torn down.

36:33.257 --> 36:34.986
No, Patti, not the church.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.584
There's going to be
an earthquake and you...

36:38.996 --> 36:40.554
Patti.

36:44.101 --> 36:46.661
- Patti!
- What are you doing here?

36:46.771 --> 36:48.705
- You've got to get out of here.
- Why?

36:48.773 --> 36:51.674
This place isn't getting demolished
until next week.

36:51.742 --> 36:54.108
Not like anything else
is bringing it down.

36:54.212 --> 36:58.649
- No earthquake. Where is it, Eli?
- I...

36:58.716 --> 37:03.085
I don't know. It may come
tomorrow or in a few days.

37:03.154 --> 37:06.123
Or a few months.
Or a few years, maybe?

37:06.958 --> 37:10.450
The last time I came here,
I prayed for my father.

37:10.528 --> 37:13.986
He was in the hospital.
He didn't make it.

37:14.065 --> 37:19.628
I have not been able to
walk through those doors since.

37:19.737 --> 37:23.901
I just couldn't believe anymore.

37:24.475 --> 37:28.206
But you said God was talking to you.

37:28.946 --> 37:32.507
- And I thought, maybe...
- I did see you in here.

37:32.583 --> 37:36.075
You don't see anything, Eli.

37:36.153 --> 37:38.246
God doesn't talk to you.

37:40.124 --> 37:43.252
You're sick and you need to get better.

37:45.296 --> 37:48.459
You're the one
I was praying for this time.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.261
- Are you certain?
- He stopped short of admitting it.

38:17.361 --> 38:20.728
- But yeah, I'm sure.
- I see.

38:21.232 --> 38:24.292
You understand, however,
that there's nothing we can do.

38:24.368 --> 38:27.235
- Yes there is. We kick him to the curb.
- Excuse me?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.796
Drop him as a client.
Don't take another penny.

38:29.874 --> 38:32.775
You're talking about hundreds
of millions of pennies

38:32.843 --> 38:34.367
in commissions and fees.

38:34.445 --> 38:36.504
His agent sent his endorsement contract.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.241
I know.

38:38.316 --> 38:42.218
You've never demonstrated a particularly
active conscience, Mr. Dowd.

38:42.286 --> 38:46.313
This isn't finding a tax loophole so
some billionaire can save $5,000, sir.

38:46.390 --> 38:50.952
It's a human being,
killing another human being,

38:51.062 --> 38:53.826
and making this firm
an accomplice after the fact.

38:53.898 --> 38:58.028
Your firm. My firm.

38:58.102 --> 39:02.061
I really don't think that's what
you want this place to be.

39:02.139 --> 39:04.107
I know I don't.

39:08.145 --> 39:11.376
You really feel that strongly about it?

39:13.150 --> 39:14.708
I do.

39:16.921 --> 39:19.287
For some time, I've made
no secret of the fact

39:19.390 --> 39:23.326
that I saw Eli as
my heir apparent at this firm.

39:24.662 --> 39:27.631
It is also no secret
that his status has changed.

39:28.799 --> 39:31.962
And where he has fallen short,
you've risen to the occasion.

39:33.704 --> 39:38.664
But I never saw the leadership qualities
in you that I saw in him.

39:39.877 --> 39:40.935
Until now.

39:43.280 --> 39:46.408
We'll drop Mr. Turk as our client,
effective immediately.

39:49.687 --> 39:50.847
Thank you, sir.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.890
I was just closing up.

40:01.098 --> 40:04.625
Patti's at the Silver Terrace Church.

40:06.537 --> 40:09.506
You know, just like in my vision.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.734
But, while I was there, I just...

40:11.842 --> 40:15.209
I couldn't help but notice
a distinct lack of earthquake.

40:16.614 --> 40:18.775
Maybe the earthquake was metaphorical.

40:18.883 --> 40:22.512
Maybe because you got the people out,
you prevented the whole thing...

40:22.586 --> 40:23.883
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

40:23.954 --> 40:27.981
"God works in mysterious ways. "
"Ours is not to reason why. "

40:28.959 --> 40:31.689
For a God who seems
to want people to believe in him,

40:31.762 --> 40:36.028
you'd think he'd offer up some evidence,
some proof of his almighty existence!

40:36.100 --> 40:39.263
That's what faith is, Eli.
Belief in the absence of proof.

40:39.370 --> 40:43.329
I keep waiting for some small
confirmation that there is a God.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.342
That I haven't just
destroyed my life for nothing.

40:46.410 --> 40:49.675
You going to tell me there
was more meaning in your paycheck

40:49.747 --> 40:53.615
than in the people you helped?
Could you have done that without faith?

40:53.684 --> 40:58.018
I did it all without faith!
I did it with my law license!

40:58.088 --> 41:00.249
The one I pissed on yesterday!

41:00.324 --> 41:02.884
What about the things
you learned about yourself?

41:02.993 --> 41:05.928
Your father? Me?
Was that all some coincidence?

41:05.996 --> 41:09.159
If that is proof God is behind
everything that's happening,

41:09.233 --> 41:13.294
it also means that he wanted me
to hurt the people who love me the most.

41:15.339 --> 41:19.105
That he wanted me to
break their hearts, break the law.

41:19.210 --> 41:22.338
He wanted me to force people
out of their homes!

41:23.581 --> 41:28.484
I'm sorry, man! That is not any
kind of God I want to believe in.

41:28.552 --> 41:31.385
- I know how hard this is...
- Can't even begin to know!

41:37.161 --> 41:40.528
None of this is real.

41:40.598 --> 41:42.964
None of this is because of God.

41:44.902 --> 41:48.394
It's been my aneurysm the whole
damn time and it's going to stop!

41:48.472 --> 41:52.101
Going to find a surgeon and I'm
going to get this thing out of my head

41:52.176 --> 41:55.043
