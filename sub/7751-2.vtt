This is for you, ma'am.

Adrian is having
a normal emotional reaction

00:15.914 --> 00:17.782
to a devastating experience.

00:17.816 --> 00:19.617
You should consider
hiring a bodyguard.

Hi, there.

00:27.159 --> 00:28.626
I understand
you're looking for a maid?

I'm going to propose tonight.

Will she still love you
when she finds out what you did?

00:40.005 --> 00:41.272
She better not.

Ms. Falta,
you are released in good faith.

00:52.918 --> 00:56.053
- Hello, Mrs. Peri.
- I really thought you were deported.

00:56.088 --> 00:59.056
Is Mr. Spence here?
I'd like to see him, too.

00:59.091 --> 01:00.525
Well, you're in a good mood.

having sex every day.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.641

fertility drugs if you like,

for my marriage if I'm pregnant.

I'm in love with her.

around here,

- I'd love to hear it.

Since I'm beautiful,
I can't help but notice

that neither of you
is looking at me.

in years.

And we were just catching up.

07:24.142 --> 07:25.876
No. What you're doing
is flirting,

07:25.911 --> 07:28.712
and everyone at this party's
starting to notice.

07:32.150 --> 07:33.317
Maybe it's time to go.

07:33.351 --> 07:35.819
Yeah, I think so.

to each other now?

anything's going to happen.

someone shoot her!

It's 6:00 in the morning!

09:03.597 --> 09:05.698
Can we discuss this later,
please?

09:05.732 --> 09:06.966
I am exhausted.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.302
Well, I'm your fiancée.
You should have called.

09:10.337 --> 09:11.570
You know, from now on,

09:11.605 --> 09:13.506
if you want to have sex
with hot guys,

09:13.540 --> 09:15.741
you do it here, home, okay,
so I don't worry.

09:15.775 --> 09:18.811
Dario and I didn't have sex.

09:18.845 --> 09:20.646
Don't tell that
to the other gays.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.481
They'll kick you
out of the union.

09:22.516 --> 09:24.783
We hadn't seen each other
in 10 years.

09:24.818 --> 09:26.452
We had some serious
catching up to do.

09:26.486 --> 09:29.655
So... is he an ex?

09:29.689 --> 09:32.391
He was the one that got away.

09:32.425 --> 09:35.227
When he moved to Europe,
he begged me to come with him,

09:35.262 --> 09:37.263
but I couldn't
because of my career.

09:37.297 --> 09:40.733
Of course, because your career
is very important.

09:40.767 --> 09:43.435
But seeing him last night

09:43.470 --> 09:45.471
made me rethink
a lot of my choices.

09:45.505 --> 09:48.174
He said he still loves me,

09:48.208 --> 09:50.176
and he asked me
to move to Spain with him.

09:50.210 --> 09:53.412
And this time,
I'm considering it.

09:53.446 --> 09:57.583
Uh, but... but wh...
What about us?

09:57.617 --> 10:00.019
We have the engagement
party Friday.

10:00.053 --> 10:02.188
Yeah. I'm thinking
we should wait on that.

10:02.222 --> 10:03.189
Wait?

10:03.223 --> 10:04.990
We're getting married
in six weeks.

10:05.025 --> 10:06.692
Maybe not.
I don't know.

10:06.726 --> 10:09.195
Look, I need to get some rest

10:09.229 --> 10:11.630
'cause I'm seeing Dario
again tonight,

10:11.665 --> 10:15.901

10:23.743 --> 10:25.377
Are you baking a cake?

10:25.412 --> 10:27.679
[Chuckles] I'm trying to.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.481
It's daddy's birthday tomorrow.

10:29.516 --> 10:31.216
Mm.

10:31.251 --> 10:32.785
You're such a good daughter.

10:32.819 --> 10:34.987
Well, I like to think so.

10:35.021 --> 10:37.256
Have you always lived
with your father?

10:37.290 --> 10:38.824
Oh, lord, no.

10:38.858 --> 10:42.761
After I got my master's,
I lived in New York.

10:42.796 --> 10:44.062
I was a sculptor.

10:44.097 --> 10:45.330
Really?

10:45.365 --> 10:46.899
I was starting
to make a name for myself,

10:46.933 --> 10:48.634
but then mama died.

10:48.668 --> 10:51.303
And daddy was so devastated,

10:51.337 --> 10:52.938
I had to come back
and take care of him.

10:52.972 --> 10:55.374
It was really nice.

10:56.476 --> 10:59.345
Then, one night,
he goes out drinking,

10:59.379 --> 11:00.546
and he comes back

11:00.580 --> 11:03.248
with that cheap piece
of Hollywood trash.

11:03.283 --> 11:06.018
You mean Mrs. Didi?

11:06.052 --> 11:10.823
He let that slut
crawl into my mama's bed.

11:10.857 --> 11:13.125
I will never forgive him
for that.

11:13.159 --> 11:15.961
[Spatula clatters]

11:18.064 --> 11:19.164
Are you okay?

11:19.199 --> 11:22.935
I really shouldn't talk
about this.

11:22.969 --> 11:26.171
It makes me want to spit.

11:26.206 --> 11:29.942
Maybe I should finish the cake.

11:29.976 --> 11:32.978
Good idea.

11:33.012 --> 11:34.847
Miss Lucinda?

11:34.881 --> 11:38.584
I'm sure Mrs. Didi
loves your father.

11:38.618 --> 11:41.954
Rosie, do me a favor.

11:41.988 --> 11:45.824
Don't ever say anything nice
about that woman.

11:45.859 --> 11:50.496
Okay, but, uh,
I just don't want to take sides.

11:50.530 --> 11:53.432
Taking sides
is part of this job,

11:53.466 --> 11:57.436
and I'm just happy to know
you'll be on mine.

12:02.375 --> 12:05.244
Hey, pool boy!
What are you doing?

12:05.278 --> 12:08.180
If you must know,
I'm looking for a bathroom.

12:08.214 --> 12:09.648
But you're tracking in mud.

12:09.682 --> 12:11.717
Well, that's something
to remember me by.

12:11.751 --> 12:14.420
[Chuckles]

12:14.454 --> 12:16.422
[Doorbell rings]

12:16.456 --> 12:18.524
[Mop clatters]

12:21.728 --> 12:22.761
I don't want to talk to you.

12:22.796 --> 12:23.762
Good.

12:23.797 --> 12:24.897
I don't want
to talk to you, either.

12:24.931 --> 12:25.931
Where's your room?

12:25.965 --> 12:27.699
Upstairs. Why?

12:29.369 --> 12:31.403
Mom!

12:31.438 --> 12:33.405
What are you doing?

12:33.440 --> 12:36.375
Mom.

12:36.409 --> 12:37.476
That's a closet.

12:37.510 --> 12:38.777
[Door closes]

12:38.812 --> 12:40.279
I'm here to pack up all
your stuff and take you home.

12:40.313 --> 12:41.780
I don't want you working
for the Powells. Why not?

12:41.815 --> 12:44.383
Because you're only 19,
and they're dangerous.

12:44.417 --> 12:46.919
That's
the gift-wrapping room.

12:46.953 --> 12:49.655
Damn, this house is big.

12:49.689 --> 12:52.424
Look, I don't care
what you think of the Powells.

12:52.459 --> 12:54.226
They have been
nothing but nice to me.

12:54.260 --> 12:56.161
Yeah, well, the Powells
are not the only reason

12:56.196 --> 12:57.529
I want you out of here.

12:57.564 --> 12:59.431
You should be in school
making something of your life.

12:59.466 --> 13:01.266
I can't afford school
right now.

13:01.301 --> 13:03.368
Your father and I
will take care of it.

13:03.403 --> 13:05.437
I can do it on my own.
I just need a little time.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.774
Girls like you think you have
all the time in the world,

13:08.808 --> 13:10.943
but the years fly by

13:10.977 --> 13:12.411
and then one day, you wake up

13:12.445 --> 13:15.380
and you realize it's too late
to make your dreams come true.

13:15.415 --> 13:17.583
And then,
you spend the rest of your life

13:17.617 --> 13:18.984
cleaning somebody else's oven.

13:19.018 --> 13:20.953
You're doing it again.

13:21.788 --> 13:23.956
You're trying to control me.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.891
Can't you get
a different job...

13:25.925 --> 13:27.759
- Something in a mall?
- No!

13:27.794 --> 13:30.629
I work for the Powells,
and that's all there is to it.

13:30.663 --> 13:33.732
Now, please, go back to your
life, and let me have mine.

13:50.350 --> 13:52.084
Okay, guys,

13:52.118 --> 13:55.287
I'm gonna want everything
in the master bedroom.

13:55.321 --> 13:56.421
Everything?

13:56.456 --> 13:58.323
I mean, there's over 50 boxes
in the truck.

13:58.358 --> 14:01.393
Oh, I know.

14:09.335 --> 14:11.703
What's all this?

14:11.738 --> 14:13.572
The rest of my boxes
arrived today.

14:13.606 --> 14:16.675
Y-yeah,
I... I can see that.

14:16.709 --> 14:17.809
I was gonna store

14:17.844 --> 14:19.945
some of this stuff
in the hallway closet.

14:19.979 --> 14:20.946
Oh, yeah?

14:20.980 --> 14:22.481
Well, why didn't you?
[Sighs]

14:22.515 --> 14:25.017
Because it's already filled...

14:25.051 --> 14:26.718
With Dahlia's things.

14:26.753 --> 14:29.588
Oh.

14:29.622 --> 14:31.990
So, this little display,

14:32.025 --> 14:33.659
it's your way
of asking me to move them?

14:33.693 --> 14:39.164
I guess it was a little
passive-aggressive.

14:39.198 --> 14:42.334
Tell me, what part of
this is passive? [Chuckles]

14:42.368 --> 14:44.469
All right,
first thing tomorrow,

14:44.504 --> 14:46.538
I'll have Ethan move
Dahlia's things to the garage.

14:46.573 --> 14:48.907
[Sighs] Thank you.

14:48.942 --> 14:50.309
I didn't think you'd mind,

14:50.343 --> 14:54.513
but Opal said
that I needed your permission.

14:59.686 --> 15:00.919
You know, on second thought,

15:00.954 --> 15:03.922
I don't want
Dahlia's things in the garage.

15:03.957 --> 15:06.118
Call goodwill tomorrow.
Have them take everything away.

15:07.068 --> 15:08.644
Are you sure?

15:09.669 --> 15:11.223
Dahlia's gone.

15:12.265 --> 15:16.702
But you are here to stay.

15:16.736 --> 15:18.804
[Sighs] Oh, Nick.

15:18.838 --> 15:20.706
Mm.

Hello, there.

You scared me.
[Chuckles]

15:34.821 --> 15:36.221
What are you doing up?

15:36.255 --> 15:40.025
I wanted to fix Mr. Ken's robe
before he got up in the morning.

15:40.059 --> 15:42.094
Oh. [Chuckles]
Well...

15:42.128 --> 15:44.363
That's a pretty dress.

15:46.199 --> 15:49.167
I know how it looks,
me hitting the clubs

15:49.202 --> 15:52.404
while Kenny's stuck
in that chair,

15:52.438 --> 15:55.407
but every once in a while,
I need to have a good time.

15:55.441 --> 15:58.710
It must be hard on you,
having a sick husband.

15:58.745 --> 16:01.446
It is.

16:01.481 --> 16:06.418
When I first met Kenny,
I didn't think he was that old.

16:06.452 --> 16:08.086
I just thought he was adorable.

16:09.222 --> 16:10.789
And funny.

16:10.823 --> 16:14.693
And he dressed better
than any man I'd ever met...

16:14.727 --> 16:18.730
Custom-made shirts,
Italian shoes.

16:18.765 --> 16:19.998
[Chuckles]

16:20.033 --> 16:23.669
We had two wonderful years.

16:25.838 --> 16:29.908
Then, one day,
I found him lying on the floor.

16:33.246 --> 16:35.480
So, what has Lucinda
told you about me?

16:35.515 --> 16:39.785
Did she call me a gold digger
and a slut and a moron?

16:39.819 --> 16:41.653
She never said moron.

16:41.688 --> 16:42.921
[Chuckles]

16:42.955 --> 16:46.558
Well, don't you believe
a word she says.

16:46.592 --> 16:48.794
I love Kenny.

16:48.828 --> 16:50.662
She's just jealous
'cause that big old ass of hers

16:50.697 --> 16:53.098
has been on the market for years
and no one's buying.

16:53.132 --> 16:56.768
Mrs. Didi.

16:56.803 --> 16:59.171
How could you live
with someone you hate?

16:59.205 --> 17:01.606
I just try to remind myself

17:01.641 --> 17:05.444
when Kenny dies,
all this belongs to me.

17:06.813 --> 17:09.114
And you should keep that
in mind, too.

17:13.752 --> 17:15.753
[Indistinct conversations]

17:23.329 --> 17:24.329
Mrs. Powell,

17:24.363 --> 17:26.231
I really have to advise
against this.

17:26.265 --> 17:27.531
The man
at the soup kitchen said

17:27.567 --> 17:29.167
he's seen that homeless woman
around here.

17:29.202 --> 17:30.722
If any of the other bums
recognize her,

17:30.737 --> 17:32.304
I could have my necklace back
by tonight.

17:32.338 --> 17:34.740
Well,
at least let's stick together

17:34.774 --> 17:35.807
while we hand
these sketches out.

17:35.842 --> 17:36.908
Oh, that'll take hours.

17:36.943 --> 17:38.577
Relax.
Adrian and I will be fine.

17:38.611 --> 17:41.446
[Sighs]

17:43.082 --> 17:44.783
[Car door closes]

17:44.817 --> 17:48.053
Now...
You try that alley,

17:48.087 --> 17:52.157
and, uh,
we'll search over there.

17:52.191 --> 17:53.558
[Sighs]

17:53.593 --> 17:55.494
Adrian?

17:57.697 --> 17:58.830
Darling, what's wrong?

18:01.400 --> 18:02.434
We shouldn't have come here.

18:02.468 --> 18:04.736
- But you agreed to this.
- At home, in the living room.

18:04.771 --> 18:07.372
Now that we're here,
it's so dark.

18:07.406 --> 18:10.208
This adolescent cowardice of yours
is really getting on my nerves.

18:10.243 --> 18:11.443
- Get out of the car.
- No!

18:11.477 --> 18:12.577
Adrian!

18:12.612 --> 18:14.613
Hey, little mama.

18:14.647 --> 18:15.747
Oh!

18:15.782 --> 18:17.115
[Chuckling] Hello, there.
You startled me.

18:17.150 --> 18:18.917
Oh, well, that's all right.

18:18.951 --> 18:22.020
Perhaps you can help me.
I'm looking for a woman.

18:22.054 --> 18:24.289
So am I.

18:24.323 --> 18:27.125
I don't mean
to s-sound rude,

18:27.160 --> 18:28.927
but... you are terrifying.

18:28.961 --> 18:30.095
Could you stay there?

18:31.964 --> 18:35.467
I'm warning you,
my husband is in this car,

18:35.501 --> 18:37.002
and he will defend me
to the death.

18:37.036 --> 18:38.069
Isn't that right, dear?

18:39.939 --> 18:41.439
Adrian!

18:42.441 --> 18:43.708
Adrian, open this door!

18:43.743 --> 18:46.812
Don't just sit there.
Do something!

18:46.846 --> 18:49.614
Leave her alone!

18:49.649 --> 18:51.016
Oh, my...

18:51.050 --> 18:52.617
Not one more step!

18:57.290 --> 18:59.057
Are you hurt?

18:59.091 --> 19:00.992
No.

19:03.429 --> 19:04.963
I'm just angry.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.366
[Sighs]

19:10.078 --> 19:12.345
Hey, can I talk to you
about something?

19:13.383 --> 19:16.418
Oh, God.
Are you going to ask me out?

19:16.452 --> 19:21.490
[Chuckling] No, but thank you
for the enthusiasm.

19:21.524 --> 19:24.126
What, then?

19:24.160 --> 19:27.262
You know
those egg thingies upstairs?

19:27.297 --> 19:29.631
Your mom sort of took one.

19:29.666 --> 19:31.600
What?

19:31.634 --> 19:33.168
Yeah, I was coming
out of the bathroom,

19:33.202 --> 19:34.736
and I saw her
put it in her purse.

19:34.771 --> 19:36.838
[Scoffs] That's ridiculous.
My mother doesn't steal.

19:36.873 --> 19:39.608
Well, does she borrow?

19:39.642 --> 19:40.876
No.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.945
Why would mother want
an egg thingy?

19:42.979 --> 19:44.313
I don't know why anyone

19:44.347 --> 19:46.048
would want
half of the crap in this house,

19:46.082 --> 19:47.916
but if Mrs. Powell finds
that it's missing,

19:47.951 --> 19:50.586
she might think that...
You stole it.

19:51.988 --> 19:54.957
And then she'd fire me.

19:56.526 --> 19:58.794
And just so you know,
I'm gonna ask you out next week,

19:58.828 --> 20:02.331
so try to act
[Chuckling] surprised.

20:07.337 --> 20:09.271
What are you doing with that?

20:09.305 --> 20:11.907
Good morning to you, too, Opal.

20:11.941 --> 20:13.742
That belongs to Dahlia.

20:13.776 --> 20:16.144
I told you
not to touch her things.

20:16.179 --> 20:19.381
No, you said I needed
permission to move her things,

20:19.415 --> 20:21.149
so I spoke to Nicholas
last night.

20:21.184 --> 20:23.385
And what did he say?

20:23.419 --> 20:25.487
It's a bit of a surprise,
actually.

20:25.521 --> 20:27.589
I just wanted to put
Dahlia's things in the garage,

20:27.624 --> 20:30.659
but he said
to get rid of them entirely.

20:30.693 --> 20:32.394
What?

20:32.428 --> 20:34.563
The folks at goodwill
sent a truck.

20:34.597 --> 20:36.431
I guess this got left behind.

20:36.466 --> 20:39.835
[Gasps]

20:39.869 --> 20:41.536
No!

20:43.473 --> 20:46.541
[Gasps]

20:46.576 --> 20:48.118
[Sobs]

20:49.012 --> 20:50.045
Look, Opal...

20:50.080 --> 20:53.782
- You had no right!
- Oh, for God's sake...

20:53.817 --> 20:58.934
Those were not your things,
and this is not your house!

21:03.360 --> 21:07.363
And then she screams,
"this isn't your house!"

21:07.397 --> 21:09.298
- She didn't!
- Yeah.

21:09.332 --> 21:10.666
[Scoffs]

21:10.700 --> 21:12.968
I am seriously thinking
about asking Nick to fire her.

21:13.003 --> 21:14.336
Eh.

21:14.371 --> 21:15.437
What?

21:15.472 --> 21:17.206
How long has she been working
for Nicholas?

21:17.240 --> 21:18.674
About 20 years.

21:18.708 --> 21:20.409
And how long
have you been living there?

21:20.443 --> 21:22.378
I see where you're going
with this,

21:22.412 --> 21:24.046
but I'm not some houseguest.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.848
I'm the future
Mrs. Deering,

21:25.882 --> 21:30.152
and if I politely ask a maid
to clean out a closet,

21:30.186 --> 21:32.321
I think she should do it.

21:32.355 --> 21:33.188
Eh.

21:33.223 --> 21:34.456
God, that is annoying.

21:34.491 --> 21:37.559
Look, when you work
in a house for 20 years,

21:37.594 --> 21:39.461
you start to think of it
as your own.

21:39.496 --> 21:40.929
Like this place...

21:40.964 --> 21:44.099
My name may not
be on the deed, but...

21:44.134 --> 21:45.301
It's my home.

21:45.335 --> 21:49.204
I get that.
But Opal freaked out on me,

21:49.239 --> 21:51.674
and now I have to walk
on eggshells in my own home?

21:51.708 --> 21:53.776
In that case,
you should fire her.

21:53.810 --> 21:55.577
Thank you.

21:55.612 --> 21:57.880
If she's leaving eggshells
on the floor...

21:57.914 --> 22:01.216
A maid can be bitchy,
but she's still got to clean up.

22:03.887 --> 22:08.390
Anyway, I think you should
go back to Opal and apologize.

22:08.425 --> 22:09.525
Seriously?!

22:09.559 --> 22:11.160
It's a chance to clear the air,

22:11.194 --> 22:13.028
and if she doesn't start
to behave,

22:13.063 --> 22:14.196
then talk to Nicholas.

22:14.230 --> 22:15.864
I hope you're right.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.367
I don't want to be
one of these Beverly Hills divas

22:18.401 --> 22:20.536

about her maid.

22:22.172 --> 22:24.907
It's already happened,
hasn't it?

22:24.941 --> 22:27.009
Mm... mm...

read the contract?

22:30.580 --> 22:33.215

Now, give me a break.

22:33.249 --> 22:36.318

my album, my tour...

22:36.353 --> 22:38.787
I still get all that, right,
even if we're just engaged?

22:38.822 --> 22:40.322
Hold on.
I'm reading.

22:40.357 --> 22:41.924
How could Alejandro
do this to me?

22:41.958 --> 22:44.993
You know, promises were made,
hearts were crossed.

22:45.028 --> 22:46.995
I thought we really meant
something to each other.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.997
Why? It's a fake
relationship.

22:49.032 --> 22:52.167
And we were gonna live a long
fake life together, okay?

22:52.202 --> 22:53.268
Mm.

22:53.303 --> 22:55.003
Oh! Here it is.

23:01.678 --> 23:02.911
So, what does that mean?

23:02.946 --> 23:05.447
It means if you don't
get married, you get bubkes.

No, no, no!

23:28.238 --> 23:30.339
I just talked to my lawyer.

23:30.373 --> 23:31.974
I told him I don't want alimony
or the house,

23:32.008 --> 23:34.643
so there's no reason
this thing has to get ugly.

23:34.677 --> 23:36.412
[Tucker babbling]

23:36.446 --> 23:38.447
And I'm sorry I hurt you.

23:38.481 --> 23:42.117
I didn't mean to fall in love
with Rosie.

[Toy clacking]

23:45.021 --> 23:48.123
I'm a star.

23:49.926 --> 23:53.061
Men don't leave stars
for maids.

23:53.096 --> 23:57.499
Well, this one's going to,
but I won't tell anyone why.

23:57.534 --> 23:58.767
We'll just let people believe

If you continue
seeing Rosie, trust me...

You'll be the casualty.

24:13.082 --> 24:15.117
My tear-stained face

24:15.151 --> 24:17.085

of every tabloid.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.687
I'll tell anyone
who will listen

24:18.721 --> 24:20.923
my husband seduced the maid

24:20.957 --> 24:22.357
while our baby was asleep
in the next room.

24:22.392 --> 24:23.525
Once I'm done,

24:23.560 --> 24:26.094
you'll be the most hated man
in show business.

24:26.129 --> 24:29.665
Your career as daytime TV's
nicest doctor will be over.

24:29.699 --> 24:31.333
I don't care about that.

24:32.402 --> 24:33.569
Do you care about our son?

24:33.603 --> 24:35.704
Because I also plan
on moving to Europe

24:35.738 --> 24:38.440

24:38.475 --> 24:41.176
I will not allow that.
I will fight you in court.

You're the scum shacking up

A judge

I was hoping we could talk.

25:49.192 --> 25:52.694
Did you know
I'm writing a book?

25:52.729 --> 25:56.765
It's about what I went through
to get my son out of jail.

25:56.799 --> 26:00.369
I had to work as a maid
for six months,

26:00.403 --> 26:02.304
so you'd think I would remember

26:02.338 --> 26:04.406
to respect
the people who do this job.

You've taken such beautiful care
of Dahlia's things

26:17.086 --> 26:18.220
I'm sorry.

26:25.862 --> 26:28.296
I was 19 when I met Dahlia.

26:30.233 --> 26:34.903
I was single, pregnant...

26:34.937 --> 26:36.772
And terrified.

26:36.806 --> 26:42.177
She offered to take me in
and give me a job.

26:42.211 --> 26:46.915
She was more than an employer.

26:46.949 --> 26:49.518
She was my friend.

26:49.552 --> 26:52.487
It's been 15 years

it's... unacceptable.

Rosie, what are you doing here?

32:57.928 --> 33:00.063
I saw the TV.

33:00.097 --> 33:02.499
They were talking
about you and Mrs. Peri.

33:02.533 --> 33:05.402
Look, I can't talk right now.

33:05.436 --> 33:07.737
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

33:07.772 --> 33:10.240
Not really.

33:10.274 --> 33:12.642
Do you want
to go to breakfast tomorrow,

33:12.677 --> 33:14.411
tell me what happened?

33:14.445 --> 33:16.546
No, I don't.

33:16.580 --> 33:20.517
As a matter of fact, uh,
I can't see you again.

33:20.551 --> 33:22.485
Why?

33:25.823 --> 33:28.158
My family is breaking up
because of you.

33:28.192 --> 33:30.927
I'm very upset.

33:30.961 --> 33:32.929
You have to stay away.

33:33.899 --> 33:35.999
I'm sorry.

33:53.384 --> 33:55.185
You know, my meetings
are only during the days.

33:55.219 --> 33:56.820
You sure you don't
want to come with me?

33:56.854 --> 33:58.488
San Francisco sounds fun,

33:58.522 --> 34:00.857
but I have
a lot of writing to do.

34:00.891 --> 34:02.192
Okay.

34:02.226 --> 34:03.426
I guess I'm just worried

34:03.461 --> 34:05.381
about you being all alone
in the house with Opal.

34:05.396 --> 34:07.964
Well, I told you,
we're good now.

34:07.998 --> 34:10.467
By the time you get back,
we're gonna be besties.

34:10.501 --> 34:12.168
Oh, now I'm definitely worried.

34:12.203 --> 34:13.803
[Both chuckle]

34:13.838 --> 34:15.304
See you in a week.

34:15.339 --> 34:16.806
Okay.

34:20.010 --> 34:22.011
[Sighs]

34:32.858 --> 34:34.835
_

34:34.870 --> 34:36.974
_

34:37.804 --> 34:40.505
_

34:45.181 --> 34:46.652
[Speaking indistinctly]

34:46.687 --> 34:48.351
Alejandro!

34:49.284 --> 34:50.819
Where's your tie?

34:50.853 --> 34:53.255
Well,
isn't this a casual thing?

34:53.289 --> 34:55.023
No! No. [Chuckles]

34:55.056 --> 34:57.692
This is our engagement party.
We have to look nice.

34:57.727 --> 34:59.327
Ah, geez.
[Sighs]

34:59.362 --> 35:00.662
I should have called
the whole thing off.

35:00.696 --> 35:02.731
What... you know, the more
I think about Dario...

35:02.765 --> 35:04.566
- You seem tense...
- The more that I'm...

35:04.600 --> 35:06.568
While you get a tie...
I'm thinking black...

35:06.602 --> 35:08.169
I'll get you a beverage.

35:08.204 --> 35:10.238
Okay.

35:12.208 --> 35:14.209
So, that's Alejandro, huh?

35:14.243 --> 35:17.445
Keep his glass full,
make every drink a double,

35:17.480 --> 35:19.848
and if he orders water,
put vodka in it.

35:19.882 --> 35:21.349
Why do you need him drunk?

35:21.384 --> 35:24.586
You're paid to pour,
not to ask questions.

35:24.620 --> 35:28.089
When I give the cue,
this is what I need you to say.

35:30.593 --> 35:31.793
Here.

35:31.827 --> 35:34.296
I'll give you an extra $50
if you stop judging me.

35:34.330 --> 35:37.365
Oh!
You got the white flowers.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.400
Perfect.

35:41.604 --> 35:44.706
Carmen.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.775
Why did you give
the bartender money?

35:46.809 --> 35:49.577
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

35:49.612 --> 35:51.780
Why do you always think
I'm up to something?

35:51.814 --> 35:54.082
[Door opens]

35:56.018 --> 36:00.021
Father Tomas!
I'm so glad you could come.

36:11.133 --> 36:13.134
[Door opens]

36:14.937 --> 36:17.205
[Door closes]

36:20.543 --> 36:22.644
What's with the suitcase?

36:22.678 --> 36:26.815
You might want to sit down.

36:32.555 --> 36:35.123
I need some space.

36:36.826 --> 36:39.361
I found a little apartment.

36:39.395 --> 36:41.463
Not too expensive.

36:45.001 --> 36:46.501
So, you're leaving me?

36:46.535 --> 36:49.337
I'm taking a break.

36:51.741 --> 36:53.375
A break?

36:53.409 --> 36:55.977
Zoila, if I stay in this house,
the way I'm feeling about you,

36:56.012 --> 36:58.513
we're not gonna make it.

36:59.882 --> 37:01.416
Oh.

37:01.450 --> 37:05.153
So, I just need to
[Sighs] take a few months.

37:05.187 --> 37:06.855
Trust me.

37:06.889 --> 37:09.524
It's gonna be good
for both of us.

37:16.565 --> 37:20.635
I'll give you a call
when I get settled, okay?

37:30.479 --> 37:33.515
[Voice breaking]
And I promise to eat healthy.

37:37.486 --> 37:39.487
[Door closes]

37:41.590 --> 37:43.591
[Upbeat music playing,
indistinct conversations]

37:48.931 --> 37:50.532
Hey.

37:50.566 --> 37:51.733
How are you feeling?

37:51.767 --> 37:53.435
Pretty hammered.

37:53.469 --> 37:54.602
What the hell's
in these drinks?

37:54.637 --> 37:56.037
Who cares?

37:56.072 --> 37:57.105
It's time to make our toast.

37:57.139 --> 37:59.407
Mm.

37:59.442 --> 38:00.909
Okay.

38:02.044 --> 38:03.278
[Music stops] Hello, everyone!

38:03.312 --> 38:05.847
Hey! Hi!
Hi! Hi!

38:07.283 --> 38:08.283
[Exhales sharply]

38:08.317 --> 38:10.085
Alejandro and I are so happy

38:10.119 --> 38:11.719
to have you with us
on this special night.

38:11.754 --> 38:13.555
I wish you could all feel

38:13.589 --> 38:15.690
the passion we have
for each other.

38:15.724 --> 38:16.758
Aww!

38:16.792 --> 38:18.026
I don't feel so good.

38:18.060 --> 38:19.661
Neither do I.
[Chuckles]

38:19.695 --> 38:22.497
Waiting and waiting
for the big day.

38:22.531 --> 38:24.866
Are you as excited
about the wedding as we are?

38:24.900 --> 38:28.103
[Cheers and applause]

38:28.137 --> 38:30.872
But I guess we have to wait
a few more weeks.

38:30.906 --> 38:32.107
- Aw! Aw!
- Aw! Aw!

38:32.141 --> 38:33.775
What else can we do?

38:35.578 --> 38:37.278
Why don't you get married now?

38:37.313 --> 38:38.646
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

38:38.681 --> 38:42.217
Get married now?
[Chuckling] That's crazy!

38:42.251 --> 38:44.986
I mean, we don't have
anyone here to marry us, right?

38:45.020 --> 38:46.254
I could do it.

38:46.288 --> 38:48.223
Oh, my God!

38:48.257 --> 38:51.059
Father Tomas?
Who invited you?

38:51.093 --> 38:53.461
[Chuckles] Oh, dear God.

38:53.496 --> 38:55.063
Wedding!

38:55.097 --> 38:56.998
Wedding!

38:57.032 --> 38:59.667
[Chanting]
Wedding! Wedding!

38:59.702 --> 39:01.469
Wedding! Wedding!
Aah!

39:01.504 --> 39:04.506
[Cheers and applause]

39:07.276 --> 39:08.443
What the hell's going on?

39:08.477 --> 39:09.577
[Crowd murmuring]

39:09.612 --> 39:11.246
We're giving the people
what they want.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.848
[Crowd cheers]

39:13.883 --> 39:15.850
Carmen,
we need to talk about this.

39:15.885 --> 39:16.951
Yeah, we'll talk
on the honeymoon.

39:16.986 --> 39:18.086
We need to talk now.

39:19.722 --> 39:20.922
Take five, padre.

39:20.956 --> 39:24.459
Nobody leave!
[Chuckles]

39:25.995 --> 39:28.863
Let's do this.

39:35.905 --> 39:37.672
Listen. Listen.
We have to get married!

39:37.706 --> 39:39.140
Why?

39:39.175 --> 39:41.142
Because if we don't...

39:41.177 --> 39:42.610
I get nothing.

39:42.645 --> 39:43.878
What are you talking about?

39:43.913 --> 39:45.446
Read the contract, Alejandro!

39:45.481 --> 39:47.048
You know, my album, my tour...

39:47.082 --> 39:50.985
If you run off with Dario,
it... it all goes away.

39:51.020 --> 39:53.488
[Sighing] Oh...

39:53.522 --> 39:56.958
Baby, I won't let that happen.

39:56.992 --> 39:58.526
You won't?

39:58.561 --> 40:00.628
I should have been clearer.

40:00.663 --> 40:03.831
I will personally see to it
that my label honors our deal...

40:03.866 --> 40:05.833
Oh, my God.

40:05.868 --> 40:07.168
Not just because
you're an amazing friend,

40:07.203 --> 40:08.703
but because I believe
in your talent.

40:10.239 --> 40:14.676
You're a star waiting to happen,
Ms. Carmen Luna.

40:14.710 --> 40:16.044
[Inhales sharply]

40:16.078 --> 40:19.247
You are the best husband
I never married.

40:19.281 --> 40:21.649
[Chuckles] Thank you.

40:21.684 --> 40:23.184
Thank you.

40:23.219 --> 40:24.886
[Guests screaming]

40:24.920 --> 40:27.222
[Indistinct shouting]

40:27.256 --> 40:28.723
Shut up!

40:28.757 --> 40:31.059
Get down on the ground!

40:31.093 --> 40:32.160
Get down!

40:32.194 --> 40:35.029
[Shouting continues]

40:35.064 --> 40:36.531
I'm not screwing around, people!

40:36.565 --> 40:38.399
[Grunts]

40:38.434 --> 40:39.667
[Screams]

40:39.702 --> 40:42.070
What did you do?!

40:42.104 --> 40:45.173
Let's go. Let's go.
Get out of here now!

40:46.775 --> 40:48.443
[Panting]

40:48.477 --> 40:50.011
Oh.

40:50.045 --> 40:53.481
[Voice breaking]
Somebody call 911, please!

40:56.652 --> 40:58.820
Oh, my God.
You shot him!

40:58.854 --> 41:00.121
It was an accident.
I didn't see him!

41:00.155 --> 41:02.056
Well, do you think we should
go back to see if he's okay?

41:02.091 --> 41:03.942
Are you crazy? The cops are
gonna be here any minute.

41:03.943 --> 41:05.793
[Engine turns over]

41:06.829 --> 41:09.130
The ambulance is on its way.

41:09.164 --> 41:11.399
[Sobbing]
He's not saying anything,

41:11.433 --> 41:12.567
and there's so much blood.

41:12.601 --> 41:14.602
[Sobs]

41:17.940 --> 41:19.841
Why?

41:19.875 --> 41:21.876
[Sobbing loudly]
