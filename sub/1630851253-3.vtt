WEBVTT

00:51.625 --> 00:53.625
[Paul] Bless me, Lord, for I have sinned.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.375
No, that's not right.

00:57.791 --> 00:58.625
[inhales]

00:59.458 --> 01:01.458
Bless me, Lord, for I am going to sin.

01:04.416 --> 01:07.166
Tomorrow morning, I'm going
to introduce myself to the parish

01:07.250 --> 01:10.875
and lie to them
about Monsignor John Pruitt.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.708
A lie directly, not a lie by omission.

01:20.833 --> 01:24.083
I won't tell them that John Pruitt
was a lot sicker than they thought

01:24.166 --> 01:26.458
when they sent him on that trip.

01:26.541 --> 01:29.958
Monsignor? Monsignor Pruitt?
Where are you going?

01:30.041 --> 01:31.958
We're this way. The group's this way.

01:32.041 --> 01:34.250
[Paul] And he wandered
from his tour group frequently.

01:34.333 --> 01:38.000
He spent hours
lost in Jerusalem that first day,

01:38.083 --> 01:39.625
and that he was

01:41.000 --> 01:42.083
terrified.

01:46.791 --> 01:48.708
[men praying indistinctly]

02:21.333 --> 02:24.125
[Paul] This wasn't a sort of
odd senior moment.

02:24.208 --> 02:26.333
No, this was a man
in the grips of dementia,

02:26.416 --> 02:29.666
more advanced than anyone in the parish
had admitted even to themselves.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.083
A man who had…

02:33.083 --> 02:36.916
overstayed his allotted time
on this Earth.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.250
[breath trembling]

02:39.333 --> 02:41.916
[Paul] I'm not gonna tell them
any of that.

02:43.666 --> 02:46.166
I'll say he's recovering
in a hospital on the mainland.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.291
That things may still go back to normal,

02:49.375 --> 02:51.708
that he may yet be the same
as they remember.

02:51.791 --> 02:55.041
That he may yet be the man, the leader,

02:56.708 --> 03:00.291
the shepherd they have
grown to love over so many years.

03:00.791 --> 03:03.625
I am going to tell them this lie

03:05.583 --> 03:10.125
for their benefit,
so that when it starts, they'll be ready.

03:12.291 --> 03:13.708
For what's to come.

03:15.125 --> 03:16.833
For the miracles that are to come.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.375
[inaudible conversation]

03:53.291 --> 03:54.291
[coughs]

04:00.291 --> 04:02.375
[sobbing]

04:16.458 --> 04:17.458
Father?

04:24.041 --> 04:25.000
Father!

04:39.958 --> 04:41.500
[Paul coughs and retches]

04:48.333 --> 04:49.541
[groans]

04:50.541 --> 04:51.666
[breathing heavily]

04:57.166 --> 04:59.625
Father? Are you all right?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.750
Should I call Dr. Gunning?

05:21.333 --> 05:22.416
[exhales]

05:25.500 --> 05:28.041
It's a miracle. A true miracle.

05:29.125 --> 05:32.125
Isn't it? A miracle, I mean.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.916
It's amazing, of course.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.625
I mean, her reflexes are weak,
but they are there.

05:39.041 --> 05:40.166
Had you felt anything?

05:40.250 --> 05:43.041
Had you had any sensations
prior to this morning?

05:43.125 --> 05:46.333
I don't know. I mean,
even when I couldn't feel them,

05:46.416 --> 05:49.916
I could feel them.
Like we talked about, the phantom--

05:50.000 --> 05:53.791
Phantom limb syndrome, right.
But nothing new? Nothing different?

05:53.875 --> 05:55.666
-[Leeza] No.
-[Sarah] Well, I…

05:56.458 --> 06:01.583
You are standing, you are walking,
that's the most important thing.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.791
I'm very happy for you, Leeza.

06:05.791 --> 06:09.541
Your muscles are a little underdeveloped,
which is understandable. Let me…

06:10.875 --> 06:12.416
I want you to use this cane,

06:12.500 --> 06:15.041
even for short distances,
for the time being.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.875
Put your weight on it and put it
one step in front of you.

06:17.958 --> 06:20.208
-Does that make sense?
-[Wade] Have you ever…

06:20.708 --> 06:22.750
Have you ever seen anything like this?

06:22.833 --> 06:27.041
I mean, it's a miracle, isn't it?
A real one, like a gospels real one.

06:27.125 --> 06:31.166
Before today? No, I haven't seen
anything like this before today.

06:31.250 --> 06:36.625
But now I have. Spinal injuries,
they can heal themselves over time.

06:36.708 --> 06:39.041
It's exceedingly rare, but it does happen.

06:39.125 --> 06:42.750
I would love to get Leeza to the mainland
for some advanced testing.

06:42.833 --> 06:43.666
I don't know.

06:44.833 --> 06:46.250
The more we know about what's happened,

06:46.333 --> 06:47.750
the more we can help
other people suffering--

06:47.833 --> 06:50.166
No, I know, it's not that. It's just that,

06:51.166 --> 06:54.666
over the years,
all the appointments and the specialists

06:54.750 --> 06:57.000
and the experimental treatments
that we tried--

06:57.083 --> 06:59.666
[clears throat] Truth be told, Sarah, um…

07:00.500 --> 07:02.583
Well, we pay rent
on a house we used to own.

07:02.666 --> 07:03.625
[Wade exhales]

07:03.708 --> 07:06.250
Half the food we eat
is bought on SNAP benefits

07:06.333 --> 07:09.083
and the other half
is donated from the church.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.541
Oh, we are not complaining, honey. No.

07:11.625 --> 07:14.666
You are worth every penny
we'll ever have, and so much more.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.708
But without a CT scan

07:16.791 --> 07:19.708
or a spinal tap, we're in the dark
about what's happening--

07:19.791 --> 07:23.500
[Wade] She's walking and she's standing.
And we're grateful.

07:24.083 --> 07:28.500
It feels wrong, doesn't it?
To interrogate a miracle?

07:28.583 --> 07:30.458
Second guess a gift from God?

07:46.708 --> 07:48.625
[Sarah] Where did you wander off to?

07:50.750 --> 07:51.750
[muffled thudding]

07:55.083 --> 07:58.125
Mom? Mom, how did you get up here?

07:59.083 --> 08:02.375
My room is… This is my room.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.958
-[Sarah] Yeah, Mom, but not for--
-[Mildred] It's different.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.916
-You cannot do stairs. You just can't.
-My room is…

08:08.000 --> 08:10.583
Do you know my daughter, Sarah?

08:10.666 --> 08:12.541
-She's a doctor.
-I don't know how I'll get you down.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.833
[Mildred] She can tell you,
have a bad hip.

08:14.916 --> 08:16.458
If he could… My wife.

08:16.541 --> 08:19.916
-If he could pray over my wife.
-My husband, he's been so sick.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.791
Calm down, all of you.
You know that isn't how these things work.

08:24.875 --> 08:31.458
Let's not overreact.
God does not seek glory, not like that.

08:32.791 --> 08:33.666
Let's pray.

08:36.166 --> 08:39.083
"Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good."

08:39.166 --> 08:43.458
"For His steadfast love endures forever."

08:43.541 --> 08:49.250
"Give thanks to the God of gods,
for His steadfast love endures forever."

08:49.333 --> 08:54.541
"Give thanks to the Lord of Lords,
for His steadfast love endures forever."

08:54.625 --> 08:59.166
"To Him, who alone can do great wonders."

08:59.250 --> 09:02.416
"Whose steadfast love endures forever."

09:12.541 --> 09:16.750
The fourth step can be very difficult,
but I know you can do it. I really do.

09:17.791 --> 09:21.166
We really not gonna talk about it?

09:23.208 --> 09:25.000
No, we can talk about it.

09:25.583 --> 09:26.458
[scoffs]

09:27.500 --> 09:29.166
Whole town's buzzin'.

09:30.125 --> 09:33.250
A miracle at St. Patrick's.
You're gonna have every resident

09:33.333 --> 09:35.791
with a bum knee
and a head cold in the pews.

09:37.250 --> 09:40.458
Wouldn't be surprised if you get a call
from a reporter on the mainland.

09:41.333 --> 09:44.541
Might wanna do a human interest story
on little Leeza's recovery

09:44.625 --> 09:46.791
about the priest who healed her.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.083
This isn't about publicity.
I'd turn that down.

09:50.166 --> 09:54.333
As Matthew says, you know,
"If you give something to someone in need,

09:54.416 --> 09:57.541
don't let your left hand know
what your right hand is doing."

09:57.625 --> 10:00.208
And Dolly and Wade, you know,

10:00.291 --> 10:03.125
they're not looking to exploit
their daughter or sensationalize anything.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.958
I just can't actually imagine

10:05.041 --> 10:08.875
that it'll summon that much interest
outside of Crockett, and that's okay.

10:08.958 --> 10:10.166
It's for the best.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.791
The important thing is Leeza.

10:13.833 --> 10:14.833
Yeah.

10:15.791 --> 10:19.291
See, I'm a pretty rational guy,

10:19.375 --> 10:21.666
and you know that
all our myths, our religions,

10:21.750 --> 10:25.208
come from natural occurrences
that we can't explain.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.000
So I can pretty easily
see my way through that.

10:29.333 --> 10:30.583
Good for you.

10:30.666 --> 10:33.291
I can wrap my head around a misdiagnosis.

10:34.208 --> 10:37.625
I looked. It happens.
It's rare, but it does.

10:37.708 --> 10:43.416
So, like, her body could have been
slowly healing this whole time.

10:43.500 --> 10:48.166
I can explain all of it.
If I'm honest, it's all explainable.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.166
-That sounds wonderful, frankly.
-Except one thing.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.208
You had to know.

10:55.791 --> 10:58.250
You had to know that she could walk.

10:58.333 --> 11:02.666
I mean, you went back up the stairs.
You beckoned her. If she hadn't,

11:03.708 --> 11:05.083
what would've happened to you?

11:05.583 --> 11:08.666
What would this community
have thought of you if she hadn't?

11:08.750 --> 11:10.541
-Well, but she did.
-And you had to know that.

11:10.625 --> 11:14.791
-Okay. What are you asking?
-I'm asking, how did you know that?

11:19.958 --> 11:22.791
I really don't have an answer
that's gonna satisfy you.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.541
Not you.

11:27.083 --> 11:29.500
I mean, if I told somebody else
that I could just feel it

11:29.583 --> 11:32.250
as she wheeled past me on that ramp,

11:32.333 --> 11:37.791
that I could almost see it, that I could
almost hear her voice inside my head.

11:38.541 --> 11:41.041
I felt so connected to her at that moment.

11:41.125 --> 11:44.125
That might be good enough
for someone, but not for you,

11:45.375 --> 11:46.916
is it, Riley Flynn?

11:49.583 --> 11:51.083
I suppose I'd want more.

11:53.125 --> 11:57.333
Yeah, and I'll always wish
that I could give you more.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.875
-But that's all I got.
-[Riley exhales]

12:15.041 --> 12:16.166
Does it hurt?

12:17.458 --> 12:18.375
No.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.416
Do you want me
to carry your backpack or something?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.125
Sure, thanks.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.666
[indistinct chatter]

12:55.291 --> 12:57.125
-[girl 1] Does it hurt to walk?
-[girl 2] How do you feel?

12:57.708 --> 12:59.833
Come on. Leave her be.

13:01.625 --> 13:02.583
Good morning.

13:02.666 --> 13:04.541
-Morning, Miss Greene.
-Morning, Miss Greene.

13:04.625 --> 13:06.500
[indistinct chatter continues]

13:17.291 --> 13:18.625
[sighs]

13:23.500 --> 13:24.791
[Ed clears throat]

13:31.375 --> 13:32.250
[sighs]

13:43.250 --> 13:44.166
[exclaims]

14:08.000 --> 14:09.875
[song starts on record player]

14:14.666 --> 14:15.541
What are you doing?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.500
What about your back?

14:22.750 --> 14:24.125
Just dance with me.

14:25.375 --> 14:26.458
[Annie] All right.

14:33.666 --> 14:34.875
[Ed chuckles]

14:50.291 --> 14:52.541
What? [laughs]

14:54.458 --> 14:55.791
[song continues]

15:02.708 --> 15:04.250
[knocking at window]

15:49.541 --> 15:50.541

16:14.166 --> 16:15.541
[inaudible conversation]

16:35.166 --> 16:36.666
[inaudible singing]

16:58.958 --> 17:00.500
[inaudible] The body of Christ.

[song stops]

18:44.375 --> 18:45.375
[Ed chuckles]

18:52.250 --> 18:55.750
[Paul] Fill up the extra cruets this week.
There's quite a crowd out there.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.000
[Ooker] It is very crowded.

18:57.708 --> 18:59.208
[Warren] Do we have another bottle?

18:59.291 --> 19:02.125
We had some lying around,
but I haven't seen them recently.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.291
Uh, you boys line up.
I'll take care of it.

19:13.958 --> 19:16.708
-I don't think it's lit.
-Shit, my bad.

19:28.958 --> 19:29.791
Uh…

19:30.625 --> 19:31.458
Lighter.

19:34.041 --> 19:34.875
Let's go!

19:36.125 --> 19:39.875
Three weeks ago,
when we began this journey of repentance,

19:39.958 --> 19:44.125
I asked those of you who were here
that day to keep a few words in mind.

19:44.791 --> 19:48.875
Rebirth, second chances, eternal life.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.708
[chuckles] That's a lot to wrap
your head around, isn't it?

19:53.791 --> 19:57.458
I can barely visualize next week,
let alone eternity.

19:57.541 --> 20:01.583
But, I mean, for most of us,
eternity, it's an abstract.

20:01.666 --> 20:04.958
It's a metaphor, a colorful exaggeration.

20:05.041 --> 20:08.625
When we're waiting for
something we want, it takes forever.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.583
We sit in traffic for an eternity.

20:13.541 --> 20:16.500
Abstracts, metaphors,
colorful exaggerations.

20:17.250 --> 20:21.333
To us, maybe, but not to God.

20:22.041 --> 20:25.458
Not to Him.
And it shouldn't be for us, either.

20:26.083 --> 20:29.750
Communion, the transformation
of bread and wine

20:29.833 --> 20:32.458
into the body and blood of Christ.

20:32.541 --> 20:35.583
A metaphor? No. God tells us.

20:35.666 --> 20:40.166
Miracles, walking on water,
rising from the dead. Abstracts?

20:40.250 --> 20:44.958
No. God tells us.
Eternal life, a colorful exaggeration?

20:45.041 --> 20:48.291
-[Wade] No.
-No? That's right. You call it out.

20:48.375 --> 20:54.333
God's gifts are as tangible
as the ground beneath our feet.

20:54.416 --> 20:56.875
-[bangs pedestal]
-And His covenant, it's not abstract.

20:56.958 --> 21:01.750
No. It's a contract, scrawled in flesh,
inked in the blood of the martyrs.

21:01.833 --> 21:06.083
And yet, try as we might,
we cannot visualize,

21:06.166 --> 21:10.750
we cannot mentally picture
the rewards promised.

21:12.500 --> 21:16.541
Well, if you're here seeking to know
answers to the unknowable,

21:16.625 --> 21:20.666
it's incumbent upon me
to tell you that I have none.

21:21.291 --> 21:27.000
And if you want to know why
or how God's will shapes the world,

21:27.083 --> 21:32.958
brothers and sisters, so do I.
I don't have all the answers. Nobody does.

21:33.041 --> 21:37.291
What I do have though,
and what God gives us plentifully,

21:37.375 --> 21:39.416
are mysteries.

21:40.291 --> 21:44.708
God gives us miracles very rarely,
here and there, but mysteries?

21:50.875 --> 21:52.666
Sorry. Um…

21:52.750 --> 21:55.958
As… adults,

21:56.625 --> 21:59.833
we tend to dislike mysteries.

21:59.916 --> 22:02.708
We… We feel uncomfortable not knowing.

22:03.666 --> 22:06.791
[chuckles] No. To be a child.

22:08.958 --> 22:13.333
To look with awe and wonder,
and live with staggering honesty.

22:13.416 --> 22:17.750
To be guiltless, light as air.

22:18.958 --> 22:24.041
To bend softly as the word of God sweeps…

22:27.208 --> 22:28.958
I'm very sorry. I'm…

22:31.416 --> 22:34.000
Sorry, I'm just a little bit tired today.

22:35.041 --> 22:36.458
A tiny dizzy spell.

22:37.166 --> 22:40.083
It's passed. I'm fine.
Sorry. I'm very sorry.

22:40.958 --> 22:42.208
Um…

22:43.250 --> 22:45.916
The more that we know, the less we bend.

22:46.541 --> 22:49.708
The more brittle we become,
the easier to break.

22:50.666 --> 22:54.083
Like some would say
this island broke. Was broken.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.916
But I am here to tell you…

23:00.208 --> 23:06.833
the resurrection, body and soul,
the redemption, body and soul,

23:06.916 --> 23:11.791
the miracles waiting for us
here on Crockett Island.

23:11.875 --> 23:18.166
Not metaphors, not abstracts,
not colorful exaggerations, no.

23:18.250 --> 23:22.583
Rebirth, second chances.
Eter… [groans]

23:23.333 --> 23:24.916
[all gasp]

23:29.500 --> 23:30.666
[Wade] Go get Dr. Gunning!

23:33.083 --> 23:34.625
Please give him some room.

23:34.708 --> 23:38.083
[Paul] The conversion of Saul took place
on the road to Damascus.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.375
Saul was a persecutor of Christians,
an enemy of the Church,

23:42.458 --> 23:46.333
heading to Damascus
to round up believers, take them prisoner.

23:46.416 --> 23:49.666
But as you know, as he neared Damascus,

23:49.750 --> 23:53.333
he saw a light so bright
it knocked him to the ground.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.333
And he was blinded.
And then Jesus spoke to him.

23:58.375 --> 24:03.416
Days later the scales fell from his eyes
and Saul became a follower of Christ

24:03.500 --> 24:07.375
and then became the Apostle Paul.

24:08.166 --> 24:12.250
It was on the same road
outside the city that Monsignor Pruitt,

24:12.333 --> 24:16.583
bewildered and confused, wandered
from his tour group for the last time.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.250
They must not have noticed he was missing.

24:19.333 --> 24:24.583
First his failing mind didn't help him,
and out he wandered, out into that desert.

24:25.833 --> 24:27.208
No, Monsignor…

24:28.083 --> 24:32.000
Lost, confused, lost in the world,
lost in his mind,

24:32.083 --> 24:34.125
separated from his group,

24:34.208 --> 24:38.750
certain to die out there in that desert,
on the road to Damascus,

24:39.625 --> 24:44.041
when a horrible sandstorm overtook him.

24:44.125 --> 24:47.791
There had been, recently,
horrible storms in the area.

24:47.875 --> 24:52.500
He'd heard this.
These astonishing storms, seismic storms.

24:52.583 --> 24:59.541
Storms that had, he'd heard, even
unearthed ancient ruins in the desert,

24:59.625 --> 25:02.416
that churned the ground,
stirred the earth,

25:02.500 --> 25:07.875
and pulled from it the mouths
of structures and buildings from long ago.

25:07.958 --> 25:11.666
Ruins long sealed in the earth.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.041
And so as Monsignor Pruitt wandered,
lost in the storm,

25:20.875 --> 25:24.250
the sand scratching his eyes,
cutting into his face,

25:24.333 --> 25:28.083
he saw before him,
there was a darkness in the dunes.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.291
Mouth of a cave, perhaps.

25:32.458 --> 25:34.875
A door to some ancient ruin.

25:34.958 --> 25:38.041
And his failing mind
only sought shelter, so in he went,

25:38.125 --> 25:41.375
eagerly, into the darkness of the thing.

25:42.166 --> 25:47.083
The cave-like entrance
that had just opened up in front of him.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.875
Until all light went…

25:53.500 --> 25:56.583
-It's just a dizzy spell.
-Maybe so.

25:57.291 --> 25:59.458
Still, let me listen.

26:00.208 --> 26:01.166
[Paul grunts]

26:01.958 --> 26:03.041
Deep breath in.

26:03.125 --> 26:06.416
-[inhales] I promise that I'm all right.
-And out.

26:08.416 --> 26:09.250
[Paul exhales]

26:12.125 --> 26:15.083
Your heart rate's elevated,
and your body temperature is too.

26:15.166 --> 26:19.083
It's like your body is fighting a virus,
but nothing jumps out as too alarming.

26:19.708 --> 26:20.750
So he's okay then?

26:21.541 --> 26:22.541
He'll live.

26:23.250 --> 26:27.250
You are dehydrated though, Father.
So cut out all the salty foods,

26:27.333 --> 26:30.041
drink lots and lots of water,
get some rest,

26:30.125 --> 26:33.083
and let this work its way
out of your system.

26:34.541 --> 26:36.416
-Thank you.
-[tap turns]

26:37.000 --> 26:38.333
Just doing my job.

26:38.416 --> 26:42.125
No, it's more than that.
You take care of people.

26:42.208 --> 26:47.250
Me and your mother, this whole island.
You are a comfort to people.

26:48.333 --> 26:49.500
I'm proud of you.

26:51.125 --> 26:52.041
Thank you.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.291
You heard the doctor. Drink up.

26:54.791 --> 26:57.333
And I'm canceling
all your afternoon appointments.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.791
-Oh, Bev.
-You need rest and you will get it.

26:59.875 --> 27:01.250
[sighs]

27:01.333 --> 27:04.041
Not all. There are some I will not miss.

27:07.708 --> 27:09.625
-Lunch is ready.
-[Ali] Be right there!

27:29.250 --> 27:31.416
[knocking at door]

27:31.500 --> 27:33.291
[indistinct chatter on TV]

27:34.458 --> 27:35.958
[knocking continues]

27:36.041 --> 27:37.333
[Joe] Fuck off.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.958
Fuck you want from me?

27:44.041 --> 27:46.250
You won't leave a guy alone.
Fuck you want?

27:53.791 --> 27:54.958
Hello.

28:18.625 --> 28:19.666
Is that the one?

28:24.333 --> 28:26.125
-Is it?
-No.

28:27.458 --> 28:28.458
Is it here?

28:29.166 --> 28:30.583
I'd like to see it if it's here.

28:30.666 --> 28:33.875
No, that's my grandfather's gun.

28:34.791 --> 28:38.750
The other one, that one,
I threw it into the bay right after.

28:38.833 --> 28:40.791
I couldn't look at it anymore.

28:43.750 --> 28:45.500
It's just like I pictured it.

28:49.208 --> 28:50.208
So here goes.

28:53.291 --> 28:55.041
I was walking with my dad,

28:55.875 --> 28:59.250
and we weren't going anywhere special,
it's just something we did.

29:00.208 --> 29:03.333
It's when he'd talk the most to me,
so I'd ask him,

29:03.416 --> 29:05.041
since I was a little girl.

29:05.125 --> 29:07.416
And we're walking,

29:08.208 --> 29:11.750
like any other evening,
and then there it is.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.875
Like a clap of thunder,
and I was just on the ground.

29:14.958 --> 29:16.125
But I didn't feel it.

29:17.333 --> 29:20.416
And my dad is screaming, like an animal.

29:21.125 --> 29:24.333
Never heard his voice like that,
I never have since, but I didn't feel it.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.041
I didn't feel it at all.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.833
And it was when I realized
just how much I couldn't feel,

29:30.916 --> 29:32.708
that's when I got really scared.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.250
-[exclaims]
-I hate you.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.833
Honesty is important,
so we'll start there.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.875
I hate you, Joe Collie.

29:42.958 --> 29:44.500
[Joe whimpers]

29:44.583 --> 29:46.708
I've hated you for years,

29:46.791 --> 29:51.000
and the things I've imagined
doing to you… I want you to hurt.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.458
I want you to suffer.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.083
[voice breaking] I want you to make
those noises my dad made

29:56.166 --> 29:59.583
when he put his hand
over the bullet hole in my spine.

29:59.666 --> 30:03.250
I want you to beg for my forgiveness
so that I can tell you no.

30:05.541 --> 30:09.125
I want you to live
in complete, absolute misery.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.291
So when I say this place
is just like I pictured it,

30:11.375 --> 30:14.125
what I really mean is
it's just like I hoped it would be.

30:14.208 --> 30:17.166
-I'm sorry.
-Damn right, you're sorry!

30:18.208 --> 30:19.458
[sniffles]

30:20.833 --> 30:21.791
You stole from me.

30:22.541 --> 30:24.875
Not just who I was,
but who I could've been.

30:25.541 --> 30:27.791
You stole from me
things I didn't even have yet.

30:27.875 --> 30:30.791
You reached through time, Joe Collie!

30:30.875 --> 30:33.541
You reached through time and you stole…

30:35.500 --> 30:37.125
[sobs softly]

30:38.000 --> 30:39.250
All of that is true,

30:40.750 --> 30:42.208
and all that is still in here,

30:44.333 --> 30:46.041
but that's not why I came here today.

30:49.333 --> 30:50.875
I came here today…

30:55.250 --> 30:56.541
I came here today…

30:59.875 --> 31:00.916
I forgive you.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.500
[sobs]

31:04.541 --> 31:05.875
I forgive you, Joe Collie.

31:08.625 --> 31:11.500
I forgive you, and I see you now.

31:14.791 --> 31:19.500
I see you. And I'm still angry with you.

31:21.458 --> 31:24.500
But it's different.
Even now just saying it, it's different.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.708
-Do you wanna know why?
-Yeah.

31:26.791 --> 31:31.541
Because the only thing standing
between you and a better life is you.

31:32.666 --> 31:34.833
The only thing
standing in my way was hate.

31:34.916 --> 31:37.208
The only thing
standing in your way is you.

31:39.541 --> 31:43.375
"Whoever is slow to anger
is better than the mighty."

31:44.375 --> 31:48.458
"And he who rules his spirit
than he who takes the city."

31:49.166 --> 31:52.375
That's Proverbs 16:32, Joe.
Do you know what Proverbs means?

31:53.041 --> 31:54.625
What the Book of Proverbs is?

31:55.208 --> 31:56.208
It means wisdom.

31:58.375 --> 32:02.000
Wisdom and knowledge. So…

32:04.375 --> 32:06.916
if God can forgive you,
and He says He can,

32:07.416 --> 32:09.041
all over the place, He says it…

32:11.875 --> 32:12.875
then I can forgive you.

32:12.958 --> 32:14.375
[exclaims]

32:14.458 --> 32:16.375
And if I can forgive you, Joe Collie,

32:17.250 --> 32:18.458
then anyone can.

32:21.958 --> 32:23.458
[sobbing]

32:26.791 --> 32:29.291
[Bev] I understand
that a few of you are upset,

32:29.375 --> 32:32.541
but let me be the first one
to help calm you down.

32:32.625 --> 32:35.875
No one is taking a single thing away.

32:35.958 --> 32:38.708
All of the required lessons
are still being taught.

32:38.791 --> 32:43.291
We haven't touched the curriculum,
so we get that off the table right now.

32:43.375 --> 32:44.791
Respectfully, that's not the issue--

32:44.875 --> 32:47.625
I understand
given your religious affiliation,

32:47.708 --> 32:52.666
you might find the fact that your son is
interested in the Bible offensive…

32:52.750 --> 32:53.916
-Not at all.
-…I suppose.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.833
But I would say
that if he's interested in Jesus,

32:57.916 --> 33:00.416
why not allow him
to learn a little about it?

33:00.500 --> 33:05.250
That's so not the issue, and thank you
for this opportunity to clarify.

33:05.875 --> 33:07.916
Uh, he knows all about Jesus.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.333
Well, I imagine not quite all.

33:10.416 --> 33:13.458
[Hassan] Muslims believe
that Jesus is a prophet of God,

33:14.041 --> 33:15.625
and that the Injeel, the Bible,

33:15.708 --> 33:19.708
was revealed to him as the Torah
was revealed to Moses before that.

33:20.833 --> 33:24.500
See, we love Jesus. And we love
the message that was revealed to him.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.208
Well! [laughs]

33:26.291 --> 33:29.000
I suppose we learn
something new every day, don't we?

33:29.083 --> 33:32.125
[Hassan] But we also believe,
after the time of Jesus,

33:32.708 --> 33:36.500
thanks to the interference of men,
there were deviations in Christianity.

33:37.958 --> 33:41.291
People altered the message.
Priests, popes, kings.

33:42.458 --> 33:45.208
That's why there's
so, so many versions of the Bible.

33:45.291 --> 33:48.500
-People got in there, made their changes.
-I don't think this is relevant.

33:48.583 --> 33:52.250
Okay, we do though believe that the Bible
contains some of the original word of God.

33:52.333 --> 33:53.708
That's very generous of you.

33:53.791 --> 33:57.375
[Hassan] But we also believe that God
revealed the Quran as the final message.

33:58.083 --> 33:59.458
Never to be altered.

33:59.541 --> 34:02.083
To reassert the original revelations
of the previous prophets.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.875
I don't think that
this is the place to discuss

34:04.958 --> 34:07.750
where our beliefs
about scripture might diverge.

34:07.833 --> 34:08.791
Exactly.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.541
There it is. That's the issue.

34:13.166 --> 34:14.875
That's why I think
some of the people in this room,

34:14.958 --> 34:17.250
including myself, are a little concerned.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.625
See, Muslims encourage
everyone to seek knowledge,

34:19.708 --> 34:23.541
so I am more than comfortable
with my son studying a Bible.

34:23.625 --> 34:25.625
Thrilled, actually. I've done it myself.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.416
But where I think there's an issue
is that this is a public school.

34:32.166 --> 34:33.458
That's the thing.

34:33.541 --> 34:36.791
And I think what's concerning
some of us is not the Bible itself,

34:37.375 --> 34:41.458
but that it was handed out.
Distributed to the kids here.

34:41.541 --> 34:44.458
I just ask you to consider how you'd feel,

34:44.541 --> 34:47.000
if you sent your child to a public school…

34:47.083 --> 34:48.000
Sheriff.

34:48.083 --> 34:49.791
…and they came home
with a copy of the Quran,

34:49.875 --> 34:53.916
asking about the Prophet Muhammad.
You'd feel it was an issue.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.833
If I went around handing out
copies of the Quran

34:55.916 --> 34:57.500
to the children on this island,

34:57.583 --> 35:01.083
purely in the interest
of the pursuit of knowledge,

35:01.666 --> 35:03.875
I'd expect you
chase me out of town, Miss Keane.

35:03.958 --> 35:05.791
If I may, um…

35:08.541 --> 35:09.833
This is a public school.

35:10.625 --> 35:13.458
And he's absolutely right.

35:13.541 --> 35:16.041
And I belong to
the same congregation as most of you,

35:16.125 --> 35:19.041
so you know where I fall,
but reading scripture in homeroom--

35:19.125 --> 35:24.041
Why, Sheriff, of course,
I wouldn't run you out of town.

35:25.125 --> 35:28.708
And it makes me sad
that you would think that of me.

35:30.250 --> 35:35.500
People of faith, any faith,
well, we're all of the same cloth.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.000
Cousins, really.

35:37.666 --> 35:41.500
And it was never my intention
to disrespect anybody.

35:41.583 --> 35:44.250
Never, in the least. It's just…

35:45.208 --> 35:46.166
[sighs]

35:47.166 --> 35:49.583
Having a Bible present in the room,

35:50.500 --> 35:56.916
why, it's just a book in the room
like a science book or a history book--

35:57.000 --> 35:58.541
It's actually very different.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.375
Kids can take them or leave them.

36:01.166 --> 36:06.083
Sure, I may read an inspiring passage
during homeroom from time to time,

36:06.166 --> 36:08.458
but I am not evangelizing.

36:08.541 --> 36:12.333
I am simply sharing my faith
with the children

36:12.416 --> 36:15.500
in the hopes that they might be inspired.

36:15.583 --> 36:19.875
If we had a Muslim faculty member,
and they quoted the Quran to the kids,

36:19.958 --> 36:23.208
I would be fine with that
so long as the text wasn't offensive,

36:23.291 --> 36:28.000
which, forgive me for saying so,
a good deal of that text can be, at times.

36:28.083 --> 36:31.375
-[scoffs]
-That is not an attack, Sheriff.

36:31.458 --> 36:36.541
I certainly admit that the Holy Bible,
the Old Testament in particular,

36:36.625 --> 36:40.000
has passages
that are not suitable for children.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.833
Invaluable to adults, of course,

36:42.916 --> 36:47.833
but I would never read the tale of Lot
and his wife to a group of kids.

36:47.916 --> 36:51.916
Anything that I quote, I vet beforehand.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.458
That's not the point he's making--

36:53.541 --> 36:55.583
And what is education,

36:55.666 --> 36:59.625
if not providing a student
with the option to learn.

36:59.708 --> 37:02.791
Why be afraid
to let them read a particular text?

37:02.875 --> 37:07.083
What, are we gonna burn books
we find even a smidge controversial?

37:07.916 --> 37:10.500
And in this case, current events,

37:11.583 --> 37:16.208
local events, well,
they beg further study, don't they?

37:16.291 --> 37:17.333
I'm just gonna say it,

37:17.416 --> 37:20.166
there is no point in pretending
there isn't an elephant in the room.

37:20.250 --> 37:26.125
We are living in a miraculous time.
Right here, right now, on Crockett Island.

37:26.208 --> 37:29.333
There are actual bona fide miracles

37:29.416 --> 37:32.125
happening before our eyes
at St. Patrick's.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.833
And this community…
Sheriff, you should know this,

37:34.916 --> 37:37.375
you are responsible
for observing this community.

37:37.458 --> 37:41.541
This community is in the midst
of a full-blown religious revival

37:41.625 --> 37:42.625
at the moment.

37:43.291 --> 37:49.666
And if the children of this community
cannot discuss that in their local school,

37:49.750 --> 37:51.916
well, I just don't know what that is.

37:52.416 --> 37:53.458
[applauding]

38:00.458 --> 38:04.583
I couldn't stay in that room
listening to her bullshit one more minute.

38:04.666 --> 38:07.958
It's like this particular brand
of self-righteousness

38:08.041 --> 38:11.500
that is exclusive
to a certain breed of religious.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.791
I've never liked that.

38:16.833 --> 38:17.833
Never.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.833
-Sorry, that was…
-No.

38:22.916 --> 38:23.916
[sighs]

38:26.208 --> 38:28.291
How are you? How's it going?

38:30.541 --> 38:36.291
Slowly. I guess I'm having trouble

38:36.791 --> 38:40.208
approaching people directly for my amends.

38:40.291 --> 38:43.708
So Father Paul
said I should write letters,

38:43.791 --> 38:48.333
so I'm writing letters. Lots of letters.

38:48.416 --> 38:51.250
-That's difficult.
-Writing them is hard.

38:52.041 --> 38:55.125
Delivering them, that's gonna be harder.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.208
That I'm not looking forward to.

39:01.166 --> 39:07.875
I did my fearless moral inventory,
and I found out that,

39:09.375 --> 39:10.541
man, I am a coward.

39:11.416 --> 39:12.500
Don't do that.

39:13.458 --> 39:15.125
Don't talk about yourself like that.

39:15.916 --> 39:18.458
If anyone else
talked about you like that, I'd…

39:20.416 --> 39:21.375
You'd what?

39:26.041 --> 39:27.166
I'd kick their ass.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.250
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

39:29.333 --> 39:32.250
-You'd kick their ass?
-I'd kick it, just like this. [exclaims]

39:33.500 --> 39:35.416
That was actually my thigh, so…

39:35.500 --> 39:37.541
-So I'd kick their thighs.
-Yeah.

39:44.041 --> 39:45.750
All right, Mom, time for a bath before…

39:49.125 --> 39:50.083
God, Mom.

39:50.625 --> 39:54.083
We're gonna have to start tying you down
unless you want to shatter both hips.

39:54.166 --> 39:55.083
Sarah.

39:55.166 --> 39:58.541
Don't know why I bother telling you this.
It's like I'm speaking in German.

39:58.625 --> 39:59.791
Sarah, honey.

40:01.083 --> 40:01.916
Mom.

40:07.416 --> 40:08.750
I've been…

40:10.750 --> 40:15.958
Where have I been?
Somewhere… somewhere dark?

40:17.166 --> 40:22.250
But just now… it's like I woke up,

40:23.250 --> 40:26.791
and… there you are.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.291
My beautiful…

40:34.875 --> 40:35.833
Mom?

40:41.833 --> 40:43.041
[Mildred sobs softly]

40:51.458 --> 40:53.708
When did you move me into the living room?

41:10.125 --> 41:11.333
Sorry I'm late.

41:12.541 --> 41:15.458
Told you he'd catch on. We're a trio now.

41:15.958 --> 41:16.833
[exhales]

41:18.041 --> 41:18.875
Hey, Joe.

41:19.833 --> 41:23.458
So much for the anonymous part,
eh, partner? [chuckles]

41:23.541 --> 41:27.000
And after she left,
I didn't even want to drink.

41:27.083 --> 41:31.666
I mean, I did, but I didn't want to.

41:32.916 --> 41:35.500
If that makes any sense.
I mean, I don't know.

41:35.583 --> 41:40.125
I don't fucking know. I walked up
the length of the whole goddamn island,

41:40.208 --> 41:43.000
and I figured, you know,
what happened for her,

41:43.083 --> 41:45.250
it happened here, at St. Patrick's.

41:45.333 --> 41:47.500
That's what everybody's saying, right?

41:47.583 --> 41:49.041
So I figured fuck it.

41:49.125 --> 41:53.958
And I came here
and then Father Paul tells me

41:55.583 --> 41:56.833
you guys have this meetin'.

41:56.916 --> 42:00.083
So Leeza's forgiven you.

42:00.958 --> 42:04.750
And I heard your confession today,
and God forgave you.

42:05.708 --> 42:06.833
Who does that leave?

42:11.208 --> 42:13.625
I guess I'm not
as quick to forgive as they are.

42:16.208 --> 42:17.708
All right. What do you think, Riley?

42:19.208 --> 42:22.791
I think I'm not really in a position

42:22.875 --> 42:25.416
to say anything to anyone
about their drinking.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.291
That's bullshit.

42:29.333 --> 42:32.458
No, I'm sorry, it's bullshit.
That's bullshit. I'm sorry.

42:32.541 --> 42:36.625
You've been coming here once a week,
sometimes more, if we're honest, isn't it?

42:37.208 --> 42:39.458
That's all you have to say?
Remember that first time?

42:39.541 --> 42:44.083
Remember that Riley who walked in here,
arms folded, walls up? I remember him.

42:44.166 --> 42:46.833
Think about him for a minute, then talk.

42:46.916 --> 42:50.666
Because I think there's somethin'
you can say to Joe that I can't,

42:50.750 --> 42:52.416
that nobody else can.

42:52.500 --> 42:56.041
And that's what this is for.
So don't bullshit me and just do it.

42:56.833 --> 42:57.791
Okay, Riley?

43:01.083 --> 43:02.208
Um…

43:06.541 --> 43:07.916
You showed up, Joe.

43:09.416 --> 43:12.333
You're here, that's… that's enough.

43:13.666 --> 43:15.958
It won't be forever,
but for tonight it is.

43:16.041 --> 43:19.625
For tonight, it's everything.

43:27.875 --> 43:30.875
[Paul] All right, I got it
from here, gentlemen. You two go on ahead.

43:30.958 --> 43:32.333
You sure?
We can help you with the coffee--

43:32.416 --> 43:34.500
Absolutely. I'll see you both
at the next meeting?

43:34.583 --> 43:35.791
-Yeah.
-Yeah, of course.

43:35.875 --> 43:38.666
-I'll be there. Good night, Father.
-Good night.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.208
-[Riley] Good night.
-Night.

43:48.375 --> 43:49.375
[coughing]

43:54.500 --> 43:58.000
[Joe] "Pruitt Recreation Center,"
what a fucking legacy.

43:59.750 --> 44:02.666
I mean, why not just name it
"Bev Keane's Money Laundry"?

44:02.750 --> 44:05.625
That's all it really was. Hmm?

44:07.833 --> 44:10.333
"Bev Keane's Coin Laundry." [chuckles]

44:11.041 --> 44:13.666
Or "Bev Keane's Con Laundry."

44:15.541 --> 44:20.500
Or "Beverly fucking Keane's
Queen Evil Bitch Emporium,

44:20.583 --> 44:24.791
Embezzlement "R" Us Incorporated,
L-L-fuckin'-C."

44:24.875 --> 44:26.333
Well, you'd need a bigger sign.

44:26.416 --> 44:27.833
[Joe laughs]

44:28.958 --> 44:30.541
But the point is that I…

44:31.916 --> 44:34.625
I never thought
I'd step foot in that building.

44:35.666 --> 44:36.875
Never.

44:36.958 --> 44:40.000
Thought I'd die on this island
before I ever saw the inside.

44:42.875 --> 44:44.750
But then being in there with you

44:45.583 --> 44:49.583
and Father Paul, and talking like that,

44:50.250 --> 44:53.000
under this fuckin' circumstance,
where I feel like…

44:55.375 --> 44:57.291
maybe my life might be worth…

44:58.750 --> 45:02.458
I mean, after… all that…

45:05.625 --> 45:09.166
Well, it just shows to go you, don't it?

45:11.208 --> 45:12.541
Never assume.

45:14.291 --> 45:15.958
Words to live by, them.

45:17.875 --> 45:19.166
Never assume.

45:21.833 --> 45:23.083
I'm glad you were there, Joe.

45:27.250 --> 45:28.750
[Joe laughs]

45:29.958 --> 45:32.125
Wait, you really are, aren't you?

45:33.750 --> 45:35.958
It's… What a fucking trip.

45:43.708 --> 45:47.041
Only person that ever gave a damn
about me was my sister.

45:49.833 --> 45:52.083
She left Crockett ages ago.

45:52.791 --> 45:56.041
-She never understood why I stayed.
-Well, why did you?

45:56.708 --> 46:00.041
I don't know. It just seemed…

46:02.125 --> 46:07.333
It just felt too easy to leave.
Like, I shouldn't be able to just leave.

46:10.708 --> 46:12.666
I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.

46:16.208 --> 46:17.833
She died a few weeks back.

46:18.750 --> 46:19.958
I'm so sorry.

46:21.291 --> 46:23.541
Her kids buried her on the mainland.

46:24.166 --> 46:26.916
She didn't want to come back here,
not even in death.

46:27.750 --> 46:29.916
I just wish I'd gone to see her.

46:30.833 --> 46:35.291
You know, made the effort.
I just… I couldn't. I couldn't then.

46:37.125 --> 46:38.916
But I think I could now.

46:40.791 --> 46:44.666
[exclaims] And that just… Well, that's…

46:46.625 --> 46:48.125
It just fuckin' sucks.

46:51.083 --> 46:53.625
[sighs] Well, I'll let you get to it.

46:58.833 --> 47:00.708
Does it ever get any different?

47:02.041 --> 47:03.416
For people like us?

47:06.416 --> 47:07.375
I don't think so.

47:10.208 --> 47:12.041
Nothing around us changes.

47:13.500 --> 47:16.875
I mean, maybe if we work
really hard, then maybe

47:18.625 --> 47:20.875
we become different.

47:22.750 --> 47:25.041
Then maybe at least it feels different?

47:27.250 --> 47:28.125
I don't know.

47:33.416 --> 47:35.416
Here's to becoming different people.

47:37.416 --> 47:39.208
-Good night, Joe.
-Night, Riley.

47:48.916 --> 47:50.000
[praying in Arabic]

48:00.625 --> 48:01.541
[sighs]

48:01.625 --> 48:02.458
[Ali in English] Can I talk to you?

48:05.291 --> 48:06.166
Sure.

48:06.958 --> 48:12.916
I wanted to go to St. Patrick's Sunday,
just to check it out.

48:15.583 --> 48:16.541
Why?

48:17.208 --> 48:20.791
-Everyone from school goes there, so I--
-No. No, they don't.

48:22.375 --> 48:26.958
Well, a lot of them do, so I thought
it'd be cool to go see what it's about.

48:31.125 --> 48:33.375
No. No, I don't think so.

48:33.458 --> 48:36.083
There's no good reason for me not to.

48:36.166 --> 48:38.833
There's an excellent reason.
You're not a Christian.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.750
Well, that wasn't up to me, was it?

48:41.333 --> 48:43.083
None of this has been up to me.

48:44.208 --> 48:46.375
You didn't ask me
if I wanted to be a Muslim.

48:46.458 --> 48:47.750
You are a Muslim.

48:47.833 --> 48:49.500
You didn't ask me
if I wanted to move here.

48:50.083 --> 48:51.791
-I know.
-You never ask me about anything.

48:51.875 --> 48:54.125
You're the one who decided
to become Muslim for Mom,

48:54.208 --> 48:57.458
and you decided to move here because
your precinct was too fucking racist.

48:57.541 --> 48:59.208
-You couldn't take it--
-Hey!

48:59.291 --> 49:02.500
It's always been up to you, Dad.
You make the decisions. You.

49:03.458 --> 49:08.083
But now that we're here,
and these things are happening, these--

49:08.166 --> 49:10.083
-What things?
-You know what things.

49:10.750 --> 49:14.791
Son, I know Leeza Scarborough's recovery,

49:14.875 --> 49:19.458
her misdiagnosis,
okay, I know that's a compelling thing.

49:19.541 --> 49:24.041
Dad, I know Leeza,
pretty well actually, and her case is…

49:25.083 --> 49:29.250
-It's a miracle, okay? It just is.
-No, that isn't how it works, Ali.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.291
That isn't how Allah…

49:45.333 --> 49:46.666
Do you know what it does?

49:52.458 --> 49:55.458
What pancreatic cancer does to someone?

49:58.250 --> 49:59.833
Would you like me to tell you?

50:00.416 --> 50:01.666
Because I don't want to.

50:02.833 --> 50:07.000
I never, ever want you to know
what she went through.

50:09.083 --> 50:12.166
I bear that for both of us,
and that's right.

50:13.625 --> 50:18.916
She kept her faith. She honored Him
to her last moment, and if…

50:20.625 --> 50:23.916
If God really worked that way…

50:26.500 --> 50:27.791
If He decided

50:29.583 --> 50:32.875
that He was gonna heal
some people and not others,

50:32.958 --> 50:36.500
if He chose to spare some and not others,

50:37.500 --> 50:40.791
if He handed Leeza Scarborough a miracle,

50:43.041 --> 50:46.625
but let a child die of a brain tumor
across the way in the mainland…

50:47.333 --> 50:48.166
No.

50:49.750 --> 50:53.416
No, that's not
how it works, Ali. It's not.

50:55.250 --> 50:56.916
That's not how God works.

51:00.958 --> 51:04.000
No matter how exciting
the stories are at St. Patrick's.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.708
Or the Buddhists or Scientologists.
It's not magic. It's not.

51:21.625 --> 51:22.791
Kiss your mother.

51:30.750 --> 51:33.041
Tomorrow, we can
talk about it more if you'd like.

51:38.000 --> 51:38.916
Fuck!

51:43.041 --> 51:44.083
[Ali] What happened?

51:47.375 --> 51:48.875
Nothin'. Um…

51:51.125 --> 51:52.666
I'm seeing things. Oh.

51:55.541 --> 51:56.416
Good night.

52:00.458 --> 52:04.375
Will we be able to turn the water on
before the Father returns?

52:04.458 --> 52:05.625
[man] Almost done, Miss Keane.

52:07.250 --> 52:09.500
Thank you again for the dish.

52:09.583 --> 52:11.583
Gonna start putting things
in the deep freezer.

52:11.666 --> 52:15.250
-People have been so generous.
-Well, Father Paul deserves it.

52:15.333 --> 52:19.208
[Bev] Yes, he does. And that's why
I wanted you to help me plan this.

52:19.291 --> 52:23.500
I was thinking a community dinner
to show our appreciation.

52:23.583 --> 52:25.166
Nothing too extravagant.

52:25.250 --> 52:28.041
But we could
fill the rec center, no doubt.

52:28.125 --> 52:31.625
And I thought you two
could give the primary address.

52:32.166 --> 52:34.041
-Well, we'd be happy to.
-Sure.

52:34.125 --> 52:37.625
Given what he's done for your family,
and your standing in the community, Wade,

52:37.708 --> 52:40.833
it would mean a lot as a father, as a…

52:42.125 --> 52:44.291
-Hey.
-[Bev] Father?

52:45.083 --> 52:47.166
-Oh, God, not again!
-[Dolly] What's wrong with him?

52:47.250 --> 52:49.041
-[Bev screams]
-[Paul gasps]

53:01.500 --> 53:02.958
[shrieks]

53:04.166 --> 53:05.916
[gurgles]

53:11.625 --> 53:13.000
[Bev screams]

53:14.625 --> 53:15.458
[Wade] Father?

53:17.041 --> 53:18.125
He's…

53:19.166 --> 53:21.333
[Wade] Father Paul? Please…

53:37.583 --> 53:39.250
[voice trembling] I don't…

53:41.416 --> 53:44.791
I don't understand. I don't understand.

53:45.458 --> 53:46.500
[Wade gasps]

53:48.375 --> 53:49.750
I don't understand.

54:04.208 --> 54:06.791
[Paul] Darkness.
It was darkness in those ruins.

54:06.875 --> 54:10.541
No light.
Every step forward, a step into nothing.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.250
[groans softly]

54:22.041 --> 54:23.583
[breathing heavily]

54:23.666 --> 54:25.125
[wind howling]

54:37.583 --> 54:38.583
[gasps]

54:41.458 --> 54:42.666
[matches rustling]

55:00.833 --> 55:02.083
[breath trembling]

55:02.666 --> 55:03.916
[metal sliding]

55:11.958 --> 55:13.250
[breathing heavily]

55:15.375 --> 55:16.375
[gasps]

55:18.791 --> 55:19.833
[matches rustling]

55:24.333 --> 55:25.208
[growls]

55:26.416 --> 55:28.000
[Pruitt shrieks]

55:35.125 --> 55:36.583
[creature sucking]

55:39.708 --> 55:40.625
[gulping]

55:44.833 --> 55:49.000
[Paul] And the pain, pain, pain.

55:49.083 --> 55:50.416
Pain, yes.

55:51.375 --> 55:54.458
And then the fear
was drained from his body.

55:54.541 --> 55:59.208
Drained from his body
was all the fear, pain…

55:59.291 --> 56:02.958
It was just drained. Drained.

56:05.708 --> 56:07.083
[creature growls]

56:08.625 --> 56:09.666
[smacks lips]

56:10.375 --> 56:15.375
[voice trembling] Our Father, who art
in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.

56:15.958 --> 56:18.416
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

56:18.958 --> 56:23.125
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

56:23.208 --> 56:24.625
[Paul] Those eyes.

56:25.333 --> 56:29.750
Eyes and skin and hands, but also wings.

56:30.750 --> 56:35.125
A sense of great wings enfolding him,

56:35.208 --> 56:38.375
and his mind finally found the word.

56:38.458 --> 56:43.875
The word was unearthed by his fear
like the tomb was unearthed by the storm.

56:43.958 --> 56:46.250
And the word was "angel."

56:48.333 --> 56:49.291
Angel.

56:52.208 --> 56:55.000
And he was so afraid.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.750
As a hand in the dark,
a hand outstretched,

57:03.833 --> 57:06.166
stigmata, the wound of the Lord,

57:06.250 --> 57:08.083
and from the angel's wrist,

57:08.166 --> 57:13.666
the blood of life flowed,
and a new word took shape.

57:14.583 --> 57:17.708
"Drink. Drink."

57:20.000 --> 57:24.375
"Take this, all of you,
and drink from it. This is my blood."

57:24.458 --> 57:29.416
"The blood of the new
and everlasting covenant shed for you

57:29.500 --> 57:33.041
and for all so that sins may be forgiven."

57:33.125 --> 57:36.375
These words in the old man's old mind

57:36.458 --> 57:39.250
again and again and again
and again as he drank.

58:02.625 --> 58:06.041
Monsignor John Pruitt
woke the next morning.

58:07.625 --> 58:09.250
The storm had passed.

58:09.958 --> 58:12.250
The sun was coming in
through the cave's entrance,

58:12.333 --> 58:14.875
and he walked to it. He walked to it.

58:15.833 --> 58:18.833
And he raised a hand
to shield him from the sun.

58:18.916 --> 58:21.041
His hand was young again.

58:22.500 --> 58:24.291
The decades washed away.

58:26.791 --> 58:32.166
Behind him, the entrance of the church,
I thought it must've been a church.

58:32.250 --> 58:36.208
It was an ancient church
hiding an angel behind me.

58:37.208 --> 58:40.000
An angel of the Lord, afraid of the light.

58:40.083 --> 58:43.416
Hiding in shadows.
And I bowed, and I wept.

58:46.291 --> 58:47.750
I knew the journey would be long.

58:50.541 --> 58:54.333
But I knew where this angel was needed,
and so I'd travel and I'd wait,

58:54.416 --> 58:56.958
and the angel would catch up.

58:57.041 --> 59:01.291
I'd travel and wait in fear, Lord,
fear that someone would discover it

59:01.375 --> 59:04.458
or that one night it wouldn't be there,
it wouldn't fly to me.

59:06.333 --> 59:09.916
Uh, and when it did,
I knew I'd have to hide it.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.583
And so I'd hid it in earth,
and packed it with antiquities,

59:13.666 --> 59:15.625
and I'd leave the rest to God.
Leave it to God

59:15.708 --> 59:18.958
that I might bring it safely home
to the people who needed it most.

59:20.250 --> 59:21.750
And by Your grace, I did.

59:25.458 --> 59:26.625
[clears throat]

59:26.708 --> 59:28.833
And I knew all the while
that I'd have to lie…

59:29.458 --> 59:32.625
Lie to the very people I'm here to save.

59:33.375 --> 59:35.083
To the dear souls of this island,

59:35.166 --> 59:38.166
so that we may bring them
Your love and Your mercy

59:39.208 --> 59:40.458
and Your miracles.

59:42.500 --> 59:43.375
So…

59:45.333 --> 59:49.208
Forgive me, Lord, for the small lies
I must tell in Your service.

59:50.416 --> 59:53.375
Oh, my God. I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee,

59:53.458 --> 59:56.583
and I detest all my sins
because I dread the loss of Heaven

59:56.666 --> 59:59.583
and the pains of Hell.
But most of all because they offend Thee.

59:59.666 --> 1:00:03.500
Oh, my God, who are all good
and deserving of all my love.

1:00:04.583 --> 1:00:09.041
I firmly resolve with the help
of Thy grace to confess all my sins,

1:00:09.833 --> 1:00:12.875
to do penance and to amend my life. Amen.

1:00:12.958 --> 1:00:13.833
[sobs]

1:00:19.166 --> 1:00:20.833
-[Paul gasps]
-[all exclaim]

1:00:22.666 --> 1:00:25.125
Monsignor! Oh, thank God!

1:00:25.916 --> 1:00:27.291
It's a miracle!

1:00:28.541 --> 1:00:30.750
Oh, thank God! Oh, thank God!

1:00:31.791 --> 1:00:33.000
It's a miracle.

1:00:33.083 --> 1:00:34.416
[breathing heavily]

1:00:39.666 --> 1:00:42.666
Thank God. Thank God for you, Monsignor.

1:00:43.708 --> 1:00:44.875
It's a miracle.

1:00:49.375 --> 1:00:51.166
It's okay. It's okay.

1:00:58.666 --> 1:00:59.750
[Bev shushes]

1:01:01.291 --> 1:01:02.375
It's okay.
