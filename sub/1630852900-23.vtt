00:34.367 --> 00:35.301
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:35.368 --> 00:36.536
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.603 --> 00:37.904
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.239
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK, AND A LOT

00:39.305 --> 00:40.673
HAS HAPPENED.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.409
IN IRAN, THERE'VE BEEN HUGE

00:42.475 --> 00:43.143
PROTESTS OVER THE KILLING OF A

00:43.209 --> 00:44.511
YOUNG WOMAN AFTER SHE WAS

00:44.577 --> 00:46.079
ARRESTED BY THEIR MORALITY

00:46.146 --> 00:47.180
POLICE, WE ALSO LEARNED THAT

00:47.247 --> 00:48.381
ADAM LEVINE IS AS BAD AT SEXTING

00:48.448 --> 00:50.116
AS HE IS AT COMING UP WITH

00:50.183 --> 00:53.086
MEANINGFUL TATTOOS, AND JOE

00:53.153 --> 00:53.987
BIDEN DECLARED THE PANDEMIC

00:54.053 --> 00:54.754
OVER.

00:54.821 --> 00:57.757
WHICH ISN'T JUST IRRESPONSIBLE,

00:57.824 --> 00:58.892
IT'S COMPLETE BULLSHIT.

00:58.958 --> 00:59.859
YOU CAN'T JUST DECLARE SOMETHING

00:59.926 --> 01:01.227
AND MAKE IT A REALITY.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.296
IF I DECLARE THE QUEEN IS ALIVE

01:03.363 --> 01:05.598
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.033
WE ALL KNOW SHE'S IN THE

01:07.100 --> 01:08.935
AFTERLIFE NOW, LOOKING UP AT

01:09.002 --> 01:10.303
DIANA.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.838
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH

01:11.905 --> 01:15.642
RON DeSANTIS, FLORIDA GOVERNOR

01:15.708 --> 01:16.743
AND PLAYMOBIL FIGURINE INSPIRED

01:16.810 --> 01:18.077
BY A DETAILED HR COMPLAINT.

01:18.144 --> 01:18.745
DeSANTIS MADE HEADLINES

01:18.812 --> 01:21.147
RECENTLY, AFTER DOING THIS:

01:21.214 --> 01:22.949
>> THIS MORNING, A SURPRISING

01:23.016 --> 01:24.017
SCENE IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.152
TWO PLANES FILLED WITH ABOUT 50

01:26.219 --> 01:27.987
MIGRANTS LANDING ON THE ISLAND.

01:28.054 --> 01:29.689
>> 50 UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS,

01:29.756 --> 01:31.057
INCLUDING SEVERAL CHILDREN,

01:31.124 --> 01:33.193
ARRIVING IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD,

01:33.259 --> 01:34.994
FLOWN IN BY FLORIDA REPUBLICAN

01:35.061 --> 01:37.230
GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENTIAL

01:37.297 --> 01:38.498
HOPEFUL RON DeSANTIS, AN EFFORT

01:38.565 --> 01:39.899
TO TURN THE SPOTLIGHT TO

01:39.966 --> 01:41.067
IMMIGRATION JUST TWO MONTHS

01:41.134 --> 01:43.269
BEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

01:43.336 --> 01:44.704
>> John: YEAH, IT CERTAINLY WAS

01:44.771 --> 01:46.873
"A SURPRISING SCENE ON MARTHA'S

01:46.940 --> 01:47.774
VINEYARD," WHICH, TO BE HONEST,

01:47.841 --> 01:49.008
SOUNDS LIKE A ROMANCE NOVEL

01:49.075 --> 01:50.677
DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU CUM

01:50.743 --> 01:52.378
PUMPKIN SPICE.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.614
AND LOOK: OBVIOUSLY, SENDING A

01:54.681 --> 01:56.382
GROUP OF MIGRANTS THERE WAS

01:56.449 --> 01:58.017
RECKLESS, BECAUSE MARTHA'S

01:58.084 --> 01:59.385
VINEYARD ISN'T SET UP WITH ANY

01:59.452 --> 02:01.421
OF THE KEY RESOURCES MIGRANTS

02:01.488 --> 02:02.455
NEED, UNLESS FOR SOME REASON

02:02.522 --> 02:03.656
THEY'RE DESPERATE FOR A

02:03.723 --> 02:06.526
FISHMONGER TO OVER-DESCRIBE WHAT

02:06.593 --> 02:07.126
IT WAS LIKE TO SELL JACKIE O A

02:07.193 --> 02:08.394
POUND OF SCALLOPS IN 1983.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.997
AND IF THIS SEEMS LIKE A STUNT

02:11.064 --> 02:12.732
MADE FOR FOX NEWS, YOU'RE

02:12.799 --> 02:13.933
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT -- BUT IT ALSO

02:14.000 --> 02:16.069
MAY'VE BEEN MADE BY FOX NEWS.

02:16.135 --> 02:18.638
BECAUSE JUST TWO MONTHS AGO,

02:18.705 --> 02:19.572
TUCKER CARLSON DID A SEGMENT

02:19.639 --> 02:21.441
POINTING OUT THE WHITENESS OF

02:21.508 --> 02:22.876
MARTHA'S VINEYARD AND HAD THIS

02:22.942 --> 02:23.910
FUN PROPOSAL:

02:23.977 --> 02:25.178
>> THEY ARE BEGGING FOR MORE

02:25.245 --> 02:26.379
DIVERSITY.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.780
WHY NOT SEND MIGRANTS THERE, IN

02:27.847 --> 02:29.516
HUGE NUMBERS?

02:29.582 --> 02:31.351
LET'S START WITH 300,000 AND

02:31.417 --> 02:32.619
MOVE UP FROM THERE.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.254
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, MARTHA'S

02:34.320 --> 02:35.488
VINEYARD IS AN ISLAND THAT HAS A

02:35.555 --> 02:36.823
YEAR-ROUND POPULATION UNDER

02:36.890 --> 02:37.857
20,000.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.626
SUGGESTING SENDING 300,000 THERE

02:39.692 --> 02:41.995
IS A LITTLE LIKE SUGGESTING YOU

02:42.061 --> 02:43.663
LET TUCKER CARLSON BRING YOU TO

02:43.730 --> 02:45.031
SEXUAL COMPLETION -- IT ISN'T

02:45.098 --> 02:48.268
JUST A DISGUSTING IDEA, IT'S A

02:48.334 --> 02:50.670
LOGISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE ONE.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.272
BUT IT SEEMS DeSANTIS JUST TOOK

02:52.338 --> 02:53.873
THAT IDEA AND RAN WITH IT.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.009
SO I GUESS IT'S TRUE THEY SAY:

02:56.075 --> 02:57.710
GOOD ARTISTS BORROW, GREAT

02:57.777 --> 02:59.012
ARTISTS STEAL, AND RACIST

02:59.078 --> 03:00.380
GOVERNORS GET THEIR IDEAS YELLED

03:00.446 --> 03:01.681
AT THEM BY THE HUMAN EQUIVALENT

03:01.748 --> 03:03.216
OF THE BOAT SHOE FOUND AT THE

03:03.283 --> 03:06.986
SCENE OF A HAZING DEATH.

03:07.053 --> 03:08.321
THE STUNT WAS BOTH GRIM AND

03:08.388 --> 03:10.456
DEEPLY CYNICAL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN

03:10.523 --> 03:11.658
THE MIGRANTS WERE REPORTEDLY

03:11.724 --> 03:13.760
LURED THERE WITH EMPTY PROMISES

03:13.826 --> 03:15.562
OF JOBS AND HOUSING, AND EVEN

03:15.628 --> 03:17.697
HANDED BROCHURES LISTING

03:17.764 --> 03:18.965
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE THEY WERE

03:19.032 --> 03:20.500
NOT ELIGIBLE FOR.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.402
IN FACT, THAT BROCHURE WAS SO

03:22.468 --> 03:23.570
SLOPPILY DESIGNED THAT, WHILE IT

03:23.636 --> 03:25.204
FEATURED A FLAG FOR

03:25.271 --> 03:26.573
MASSACHUSETTS, THAT'S NOT THE

03:26.639 --> 03:27.607
STATE'S ACTUAL FLAG.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.676
THIS IS THE REAL FLAG.

03:29.742 --> 03:32.745
THAT IS JUST A FAKE FLAG THEY

03:32.812 --> 03:34.948
FOUND FROM THIS POST ONLINE MADE

03:35.014 --> 03:35.548
BY SOMEBODY WHO SAID, AND I

03:35.615 --> 03:37.884
QUOTE, "THE CURRENT ONE BLOWS,

03:37.951 --> 03:40.086
SO I MADE THIS ONE."

03:40.153 --> 03:41.588
THE BOSTON GLOBE ACTUALLY

03:41.654 --> 03:43.122
TRACKED DOWN THE GUY WHO MADE

03:43.189 --> 03:45.224
IT, WHO SAID, "NO ONE HAD SEEN

03:45.291 --> 03:46.859
THIS FLAG UNTIL SOME IDIOT

03:46.926 --> 03:49.829
STAFFER FOR DeSANTIS OR WHOEVER"

03:49.896 --> 03:51.698
STUMBLED ACROSS IT, "I CANNOT

03:51.764 --> 03:54.067
FATHOM WHY THEY WOULD USE THE

03:54.133 --> 03:55.201
WRONG ONE," ADDING, "THIS IS ALL

03:55.268 --> 03:56.002
HILARIOUS, ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME

03:56.069 --> 03:56.869
TIME DEEPLY SAD, BECAUSE THE

03:56.936 --> 03:58.838
REAL STORY IS ASYLUM SEEKERS

03:58.905 --> 04:00.139
BEING EXPLOITED AND HUMAN

04:00.206 --> 04:01.007
TRAFFICKED."

04:01.074 --> 04:02.909
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

04:02.976 --> 04:06.779
ALSO, HOW COULD RON DeSANTIS NOT

04:06.846 --> 04:07.513
KNOW IT WAS THE WRONG FLAG?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.749
HE SPENT THREE YEARS AT HARVARD

04:09.816 --> 04:11.317
LAW SCHOOL, WHICH IS -- CORRECT

04:11.384 --> 04:12.685
ME IF I'M WRONG -- IN FUCKING

04:12.752 --> 04:14.721
MASSACHUSETTS!

04:14.787 --> 04:16.489
I REALLY HOPE DeSANTIS PAID MORE

04:16.556 --> 04:18.057
ATTENTION TO THE LAW PART OF LAW

04:18.124 --> 04:19.425
SCHOOL, ESPECIALLY AS IT SEEMS

04:19.492 --> 04:22.629
LIKE HE MIGHT WELL NEED IT,

04:22.695 --> 04:23.229
GIVEN THAT A TEXAS SHERIFF HAS

04:23.296 --> 04:25.365
OPENED A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

04:25.431 --> 04:26.099
INTO THE MIGRANTS' TRIPS TO

04:26.165 --> 04:26.833
MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.736
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WHY A

04:29.802 --> 04:30.870
TEXAS SHERIFF AND NOT A FLORIDA

04:30.937 --> 04:33.272
ONE?," IT TURNS OUT, FOR ALL

04:33.339 --> 04:35.875
DESANTIS'S TALK ABOUT THE

04:35.942 --> 04:37.610
URGENCY OF THIS ISSUE FOR HIS

04:37.677 --> 04:39.045
VOTERS, THESE MIGRANTS DIDN'T

04:39.112 --> 04:40.480
EVEN COME FROM HIS STATE.

04:40.546 --> 04:44.350
WHY NOT?

04:44.417 --> 04:45.251
I'LL JUST LET HIM EXPLAIN.

04:45.318 --> 04:46.185
>> THE PROBLEM IS IS WE'RE NOT

04:46.252 --> 04:47.320
SEEING MASS MOVEMENTS OF THEM

04:47.387 --> 04:50.189
INTO FLORIDA, SO YOU END UP WITH

04:50.256 --> 04:51.457
A CAR WITH MAYBE TWO.

04:51.524 --> 04:53.259
AND IF WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

04:53.326 --> 04:54.560
ILLEGAL, AND THERE'S SOMEONE

04:54.627 --> 04:55.228
THAT'S KINDA SMUGGLING, THEN

04:55.294 --> 04:56.095
COMMITTING CRIME, THEN YOU CAN

04:56.162 --> 04:56.963
DO ARRESTS, THERE HAVE BEEN DRUG

04:57.030 --> 04:58.197
SEIZURES.

04:58.264 --> 04:58.865
BUT THAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH

04:58.931 --> 05:01.300
TO STOP THE MASS MIGRATION, BUT

05:01.367 --> 05:02.502
IT'S JUST COMING IN

05:02.568 --> 05:06.706
ONESIE-TWOSIES.

05:06.773 --> 05:07.240
>> John: OKAY, FIRST;

05:07.306 --> 05:10.743
"ONESIE-TWOSIES?"

05:10.810 --> 05:11.944
THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES,

05:12.011 --> 05:14.681
NOT A BABY'S FUCKING TOES.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.983
BUT SECOND, IT SEEMS, THIS HUGE

05:17.050 --> 05:18.584
PROBLEM FOR HIS STATE, MASS

05:18.651 --> 05:19.719
MIGRATION, IS ACTUALLY SO LITTLE

05:19.786 --> 05:21.888
OF A PROBLEM, HE HAD TO BORROW

05:21.954 --> 05:23.956
FIFTY MIGRANTS FROM A STATE

05:24.023 --> 05:25.324
HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.926
STILL, CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE:

05:26.993 --> 05:28.528
NOTHING SAYS "I'M AGAINST

05:28.594 --> 05:29.762
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND HUMAN

05:29.829 --> 05:30.763
TRAFFICKING" QUITE LIKE MAKING

05:30.830 --> 05:32.231
FAKE DOCUMENTS TO SMUGGLE PEOPLE

05:32.298 --> 05:34.200
ACROSS A BORDER.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.802
AND LOOK: WE COULD SPEND THE

05:35.868 --> 05:37.003
REST OF THIS SHOW TALKING ABOUT

05:37.070 --> 05:39.305
DeSANTIS, AND WHY HE ALWAYS

05:39.372 --> 05:40.473
LOOKS LIKE HE'S WEARING A SUIT

05:40.540 --> 05:41.974
"UNDER" HIS SUIT.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.243
BUT THERE'S ALSO AN URGENT

05:44.310 --> 05:46.312
CRISIS GOING ON IN PUERTO RICO:

05:46.379 --> 05:47.480
>> THIS MORNING, PUERTO RICO IN

05:47.547 --> 05:49.849
THE DARK AFTER POWERFUL WINDS

05:49.916 --> 05:51.050
FROM FIONA KNOCKED OUT POWER TO

05:51.117 --> 05:53.152
NEARLY EVERYONE ON THE ISLAND.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.454
>> IN UTUADO IN THE CENTER OF

05:54.520 --> 05:55.955
THE ISLAND, THIS NEW METAL

05:56.022 --> 05:57.657
BRIDGE, BUILT JUST FOUR YEARS

05:57.724 --> 05:58.725
AGO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA, WAS

05:58.791 --> 06:00.126
SWEPT AWAY LIKE A TWIG.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.194
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.662
THAT'S DEVASTATING.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.197
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT SOMETHING HAS

06:04.263 --> 06:05.865
BEEN "SWEPT AWAY LIKE A TWIG,"

06:05.932 --> 06:08.334
YOU EXPECT THAT SOMETHING TO BE

06:08.401 --> 06:11.070
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET IN A LIGHT

06:11.137 --> 06:12.205
BREEZE, NOT A LARGE PIECE OF

06:12.271 --> 06:13.740
INFRASTRUCTURE IN A RIVER.

06:13.806 --> 06:15.274
ONE REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THE

06:15.341 --> 06:16.609
CURRENT DEVASTATION IN

06:16.676 --> 06:17.977
PUERTO RICO IS THAT, WHILE IT'S

06:18.044 --> 06:19.112
REMINISCENT OF WHAT HAPPENED

06:19.178 --> 06:20.446
THERE FIVE YEARS AGO WITH

06:20.513 --> 06:22.582
HURRICANE MARIA, THAT MADE

06:22.648 --> 06:24.350
LANDFALL AS A CATEGORY 4 STORM,

06:24.417 --> 06:25.785
WHEREAS HURRICANE FIONA WAS JUST

06:25.852 --> 06:27.053
A CATEGORY 1.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.656
AND THAT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT

06:30.723 --> 06:31.290
THE RECOVERY FROM MARIA HAS BEEN

06:31.357 --> 06:32.592
A COMPLETE SHAMBLES, FROM THE

06:32.658 --> 06:35.128
MOMENT TRUMP FLUNG PAPER TOWELS

06:35.194 --> 06:36.696
AT PEOPLE, TO RIGHT NOW.

06:36.763 --> 06:37.797
THERE'VE BEEN UNFORGIVABLE

06:37.864 --> 06:38.998
DELAYS IN STRENGTHENING

06:39.065 --> 06:40.399
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THE POWER

06:40.466 --> 06:42.335
GRID, DESPITE BILLIONS OF

06:42.401 --> 06:43.503
FEDERAL DOLLARS BEING ALLOCATED

06:43.569 --> 06:44.036
TO IT.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.972
AND ABOUT THE POWER GRID: AFTER

06:46.038 --> 06:47.006
YEARS OF MISMANAGEMENT BY THE

06:47.073 --> 06:49.408
ISLAND'S PUBLICLY-OWNED UTILITY,

06:49.475 --> 06:50.977
IN 2021, A PRIVATE COMPANY

06:51.043 --> 06:54.013
CALLED LUMA ENERGY TOOK OVER

06:54.080 --> 06:54.313
OPERATIONS.

06:54.380 --> 06:54.881
BUT INCREDIBLY, SINCE THEN,

06:54.947 --> 06:56.816
THINGS HAVE MANAGED TO GET EVEN

06:56.883 --> 06:57.917
WORSE.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.185
NOT ONLY ARE OUTAGES NOW LONGER,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.554
AT ONE POINT A HOSPITAL LOST

07:01.621 --> 07:02.922
POWER FOR SIXTEEN HOURS.

07:02.989 --> 07:03.856
AND THAT WAS DURING NORMAL

07:03.923 --> 07:05.725
WEATHER.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.059
AS FOR THE HEAD OF LUMA, IN A

07:07.126 --> 07:08.261
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING LAST YEAR,

07:08.327 --> 07:09.595
HE DIDN'T SEEM ESPECIALLY

07:09.662 --> 07:11.297
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THINGS WERE

07:11.364 --> 07:12.799
GOING.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.433
>> HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE

07:14.500 --> 07:16.669
LUMA'S TRANSITION TO MANAGING

07:16.736 --> 07:18.738
PUERTO RICO'S ELECTRICAL GRID SO

07:18.805 --> 07:20.106
FAR, WITH 1 BEING A TOTAL

07:20.173 --> 07:24.243
DISASTER AND 10 BEING A

14:54.460 --> 14:56.061
MISOGYNISTIC HOMOPHOBE WHO

14:56.128 --> 14:57.096
GESTURES LIKE HE RUNS A TECH

14:57.162 --> 14:58.831
STARTUP.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.733
BUT NOW HE'S CAMPAIGNING AS AN

15:00.799 --> 15:02.468
INCUMBENT PRESIDENT, AND HE'S

15:02.534 --> 15:03.168
BEEN DRAWING ON ALL THE PERKS OF

15:03.235 --> 15:04.703
THE OFFICE -- INCLUDING RECENTLY

15:04.770 --> 15:07.673
TURNING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF

15:07.740 --> 15:10.409
BRAZILIAN INDEPENDENCE INTO A

15:10.476 --> 15:12.077
CAMPAIGN RALLY FOR HIMSELF.

15:12.144 --> 15:13.279
>> HIS RALLY IN BRAZIL'S CAPITAL

15:13.345 --> 15:14.647
CITY BRASILIA DREW TENS OF

15:14.713 --> 15:15.614
THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS, AND A

15:15.681 --> 15:18.150
MILITARY DISPLAY OF PLANES,

15:18.217 --> 15:21.954
PARACHUTISTS, AND TANKS.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.290
EVEN THE EMBALMED HEART OF

15:24.356 --> 15:26.859
MONARCH DOM PEDRO I, WHO

15:26.925 --> 15:28.594
DECLARED BRAZIL'S INDEPENDENCE

15:28.661 --> 15:30.095
FROM PORTUGAL 200 YEARS AGO.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.230
WAS BROUGHT OVER FROM EUROPE TO

15:31.297 --> 15:33.065
BE ON DISPLAY.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.333
>> John: WOW.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.801
FIRST, IF YOU WERE WONDERING

15:35.868 --> 15:36.969
WHAT DOM PEDRO THE FIRST DIED

15:37.036 --> 15:38.470
OF, IT WAS PROBABLY HIS HEART

15:38.537 --> 15:40.239
LOOKING LIKE THAT.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.841
BUT IT'S TRUE -- THEY PUT A

15:42.908 --> 15:45.277
TWO-CENTURY-OLD HEART ON AN AIR

15:45.344 --> 15:45.811
FORCE PLANE AND FLEW IT TO

15:45.878 --> 15:46.812
BRAZIL.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.147
IT'S ACTUALLY THE FIRST

15:48.213 --> 15:49.381
UNNATURALLY PRESERVED HUMAN BODY

15:49.448 --> 15:50.883
PART TO FLY ON A MILITARY JET

15:50.949 --> 15:54.353
SINCE ALL OF TOM CRUISE.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.521
BOLSONARO'S MAIN OPPONENT IS

15:55.587 --> 15:58.190
FORMER PRESIDENT, LUIZ INACIO

15:58.257 --> 15:59.525
LULA DA SILVA.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.493
HE WAS INCREDIBLY POPULAR IN

16:01.560 --> 16:02.227
OFFICE, BUT LATER GOT CAUGHT UP

16:02.294 --> 16:03.762
IN THE INTERNATIONAL CORRUPTION

16:03.829 --> 16:05.464
INVESTIGATION "OPERATION CAR

16:05.531 --> 16:07.032
WASH," EVEN LANDING IN PRISON

16:07.099 --> 16:10.002
DURING BRAZIL'S LAST ELECTION.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.136
BUT HIS CONVICTION'S SINCE BEEN

16:11.203 --> 16:12.771
ANNULLED, AND POLLS NOW

16:12.838 --> 16:14.840
CONSISTENTLY SHOW HIM LEADING

16:14.907 --> 16:17.376
THE RACE BY A WIDE MARGIN --

16:17.443 --> 16:18.744
ABOUT 10%.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.379
BUT THE CONCERNS IN BRAZIL ARE

16:20.446 --> 16:22.147
THAT IF, AS SEEMS LIKELY,

16:22.214 --> 16:24.350
BOLSONARO LOSES, HE WON'T GIVE

16:24.416 --> 16:26.085
UP HIS OFFICE WITHOUT A FIGHT,

16:26.151 --> 16:27.319
AND COULD EVEN "FOLLOW TRUMP'S

16:27.386 --> 16:29.888
EXAMPLE IN ENCOURAGING

16:29.955 --> 16:30.489
SUPPORTERS TO BACK A "TROPICAL

16:30.556 --> 16:31.623
VERSION" OF THE CAPITOL RIOT."

16:31.690 --> 16:32.891
WHICH ISN'T GREAT.

16:32.958 --> 16:33.892
ALTHOUGH -- FOR THE RECORD --

16:33.959 --> 16:35.194
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO USE THE

16:35.260 --> 16:36.628
WORD "TROPICAL" TO DESCRIBE AN

16:36.695 --> 16:38.163
INSURRECTION JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE

16:38.230 --> 16:40.065
TALKING ABOUT LATIN AMERICA.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.400
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE "TROPICAL

16:41.467 --> 16:44.503
RIOT" SOUNDS LIKE A MOUNTAIN DEW

16:44.570 --> 16:45.838
FLAVOR THAT WAS RECALLED FOR

16:45.904 --> 16:48.073
BLINDING SEVERAL CHILDREN.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.575
AND BOLSONARO'S VERSION OF

16:49.641 --> 16:52.711
JANUARY 6 COULD BE A LOT MORE

16:52.778 --> 16:53.512
DESTRUCTIVE THAN TRUMP'S, GIVEN

16:53.579 --> 16:55.848
THAT HE'S DONE A LOT TO

16:55.914 --> 16:56.515
CULTIVATE SUPPORT WITHIN THE

16:56.582 --> 16:57.883
MILITARY.

16:57.950 --> 16:58.984
WHICH MAKES IT MORE THAN A

16:59.051 --> 17:01.253
LITTLE CONCERNING WHEN HE STANDS

17:01.320 --> 17:01.854
IN FRONT OF HIS SUPPORTERS AND

17:01.920 --> 17:04.223
SAYS THINGS LIKE THIS:

17:04.289 --> 17:05.190
>> THERE ARE ONLY THREE

17:05.257 --> 17:08.394
ALTERNATIVES FOR ME:

17:08.460 --> 17:10.529
TO BE ARRESTED, TO BE KILLED, OR

17:10.596 --> 17:14.933
TO BE VICTORIOUS.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.668
AND I TELL THOSE SCUMBAGS, I

17:16.735 --> 17:19.705
WILL NEVER GO TO JAIL.

17:19.772 --> 17:20.873
>> John: OKAY, THAT'S NEVER A

17:20.939 --> 17:22.007
GOOD OMEN.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.242
NO ONE SAYS THAT BEFORE DOING

17:23.308 --> 17:24.610
SOMETHING PLEASANT.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.278
NO ONE SAYS THEIR OPTIONS ARE

17:26.345 --> 17:27.446
"VICTORY, PRISON OR DEATH"

17:27.513 --> 17:29.648
BEFORE THEY, SAY, MARCH INTO

17:29.715 --> 17:31.150
"THE GREAT BRITISH BAKE OFF"

17:31.216 --> 17:32.918
TENT FOR BISCUIT WEEK.

17:32.985 --> 17:33.952
NOT EVEN THE GERMAN GUY, AND

17:34.019 --> 17:35.020
HONESTLY, I WAS KIND OF

17:35.087 --> 17:36.588
EXPECTING THAT FROM HIM.

17:36.655 --> 17:38.323
THE FIRST ROUND OF THE ELECTION

17:38.390 --> 17:40.259
IS NEXT SUNDAY, AND IF NO ONE

17:40.325 --> 17:42.060
WINS MORE THAN 50% OF THE VOTE,

17:42.127 --> 17:43.495
IT'LL GO TO A SECOND ROUND ON

17:43.562 --> 17:44.963
OCTOBER 30 -- ALTHOUGH,

17:45.030 --> 17:46.698
WORRYINGLY, BOLSONARO HAS SAID

17:46.765 --> 17:49.401
THAT IF HE DOESN'T WIN OUTRIGHT

17:49.468 --> 17:52.004
NEXT SUNDAY, RECEIVING AT LEAST

17:52.070 --> 17:53.105
60% OF THE VOTES, SOMETHING

17:53.172 --> 17:56.308
QUOTE "ABNORMAL" TOOK PLACE.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.143
SO IF ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST

17:58.210 --> 17:59.278
DEMOCRACIES SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT

17:59.344 --> 18:00.379
BE BARRELING TOWARDS A CLIFF,

18:00.446 --> 18:01.847
TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT JAIR

18:01.914 --> 18:02.948
BOLSONARO, THE MAN WITH HIS FOOT

18:03.015 --> 18:04.817
PLANTED FIRMLY ON THE GAS.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.752
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

18:06.819 --> 18:07.286
THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S

18:07.352 --> 18:09.321
GOVERNED PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY HOW

18:09.388 --> 18:10.589
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.624
HE'S FOLLOWED THROUGH ON A BIG

18:12.691 --> 18:14.927
CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO MAKE GUNS

18:14.993 --> 18:15.761
MORE FREELY AVAILABLE IN BRAZIL,

18:15.828 --> 18:16.395
LOOSENING GUN LAWS TO THE POINT

18:16.462 --> 18:18.564
THAT, SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE, THE

18:18.630 --> 18:19.331
NUMBER OF GUNS IN PRIVATE HANDS

18:19.398 --> 18:22.267
HAS DOUBLED TO NEARLY 2 MILLION,

18:22.334 --> 18:23.135
DESPITE POLLS SHOWING THE

18:23.202 --> 18:26.104
MAJORITY OF BRAZILIANS ARE

18:26.171 --> 18:27.606
AGAINST MAKING THE SALE AND

18:27.673 --> 18:28.407
POSSESSION OF WEAPONS EASIER.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.210
SO HE'S GIVING PEOPLE SOMETHING

18:31.276 --> 18:33.011
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR AND DON'T

18:33.078 --> 18:33.212
WANT.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.880
WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO THE JOB

18:34.947 --> 18:36.114
DESCRIPTION FOR THE HEAD OF

18:36.181 --> 18:39.418
ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING AT NETFLIX.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.053
BUT MUCH MORE THAN THAT,

18:41.119 --> 18:42.721
BOLSONARO'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE

18:42.788 --> 18:43.388
DISASTER FOR THE AMAZON, A

18:43.455 --> 18:44.957
RAINFOREST THAT'S CRITICAL FOR

18:45.023 --> 18:48.627
BRAZIL AND, Y'KNOW, THE PLANET.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.095
HE'S LOOSENED REGULATIONS TO

18:50.162 --> 18:51.864
EXPAND LOGGING AND MINING THERE,

18:51.930 --> 18:53.265
AND MASSIVELY SCALED BACK

18:53.332 --> 18:54.600
PROTECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.502
AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE

18:56.568 --> 18:58.804
TOOK OFFICE, CONDITIONS

18:58.871 --> 18:59.371
DETERIORATED.

18:59.438 --> 19:00.639
>> UNDER BOLSONARO,

19:00.706 --> 19:02.007
DEFORESTATION IS AT ITS HIGHEST

19:02.074 --> 19:03.208
POINT IN A DECADE, WITH AN AREA

19:03.275 --> 19:04.843
10 TIMES THE SIZE OF NEW YORK

19:04.910 --> 19:06.445
CITY DESTROYED THROUGH OCTOBER

19:06.512 --> 19:08.313
THIS YEAR.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.849
AND IN AUGUST, THERE WAS AN

19:10.916 --> 19:13.418
AVERAGE OF 1,000 FIRES EVERY

19:13.485 --> 19:13.585
DAY.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.520
>> John: WOW, A THOUSAND FIRES A

19:14.586 --> 19:15.721
DAY.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.656
THAT IS SO MANY FIRES!

19:17.723 --> 19:19.558
IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT HAPPENS IN

19:19.625 --> 19:21.026
THE AMAZON A THOUSAND TIMES A

19:21.093 --> 19:22.728
DAY, MY FIRST GUESS WOULD BE

19:22.794 --> 19:25.397
CAPYBARAS FUCKING.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.198
SELF EXPLANATORY.

19:26.265 --> 19:26.832
MY SECOND WOULD BE FROG BIRTHDAY

19:26.899 --> 19:27.733
PARTIES.

19:27.799 --> 19:28.600
STATISTICALLY, THERE'S GOTTA BE

19:28.667 --> 19:29.902
AT LEAST 5000 OF THEM

19:29.968 --> 19:31.503
WITH A BIRTHDAY EVERY DAY AND WE

19:31.570 --> 19:33.105
HAVE TO ASSUME THAT SOME COMBINE

19:33.171 --> 19:34.540
PARTIES FOR CONVENIENCE AND

19:34.606 --> 19:35.173
OTHERS JUST DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE

19:35.240 --> 19:36.041
A BIG THING THIS YEAR.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.676
BUT EXACTLY ZERO OF MY GUESSES

19:37.743 --> 19:39.144
WOULD BE 'FIRES'.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.779
THESE FIRES ARE OFTEN PART OF

19:40.846 --> 19:42.948
ILLEGAL DEFORESTATION, TO CLEAR

19:43.015 --> 19:44.616
AREAS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES --

19:44.683 --> 19:45.984
DEFORESTATION, INCIDENTALLY,

19:46.051 --> 19:47.619
WHICH CAN ENCROACH ON LAND WHERE

19:47.686 --> 19:49.288
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE LIVE.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.989
AND THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO

19:51.056 --> 19:52.591
CONFRONT THESE LOGGERS,

19:52.658 --> 19:53.258
RANCHERS, AND MINERS ON THEIR

19:53.325 --> 19:55.594
OWN, WHICH CAN BE BOTH VERY

19:55.661 --> 19:57.095
DANGEROUS, AND DEEPLY

19:57.162 --> 19:59.431
DISPIRITING.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.199
>> WHEN WE CONFRONT THEM THEY

20:01.266 --> 20:05.304
SAY, "DON'T YOU WATCH THE NEWS?

20:05.370 --> 20:06.038
BOLSONARO SAID THAT WHEN HE WON

20:06.104 --> 20:08.040
WE COULD TAKE WOOD FROM

20:08.106 --> 20:09.041
INDIGENOUS LAND."

20:09.107 --> 20:10.943
THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY TO US.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.110
>> John: RIGHT.

20:12.177 --> 20:12.711
IT'S GOT TO BE TOUGH TO FIGHT

20:12.778 --> 20:14.546
SOMEONE TAKING YOUR STUFF WHEN

20:14.613 --> 20:15.047
THEY'VE ESSENTIALLY GOT

20:15.113 --> 20:16.348
PERMISSION FROM THE MOST

20:16.415 --> 20:16.982
POWERFUL PERSON IN THE COUNTRY.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.650
IF I STOLE YOUR WALLETS AND THEN

20:18.717 --> 20:22.120
PLAYED A CLIP OF BIDEN SAYING,

20:22.187 --> 20:22.854
"I ENCOURAGE YOU TO ROB YOUR

20:22.921 --> 20:23.355
AUDIENCE MEMBERS, JOHN.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.257
NOW I GOTTA GO, I NEED TO GO SAY

20:25.324 --> 20:27.092
TEN WRONG THINGS IN A ROW ON '60

20:27.159 --> 20:28.727
MINUTES,'" THERE WOULDN'T BE

20:28.794 --> 20:31.530
MUCH YOU COULD DO.

20:31.597 --> 20:32.631
THE POINT IS, THE DESTRUCTION OF

20:32.698 --> 20:34.166
THE AMAZON UNDER BOLSONARO HAS

20:34.232 --> 20:35.834
BEEN DEVASTATING.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.470
IN FACT, WHILE WORLDWIDE

20:38.537 --> 20:38.971
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

20:39.037 --> 20:40.238
PLUMMETED BY ALMOST 7% IN 2020,

20:40.305 --> 20:42.908
DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, BRAZIL'S

20:42.975 --> 20:44.409
EMISSIONS ACTUALLY GREW BY

20:44.476 --> 20:46.945
NEARLY 10%.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.080
AND BOLSONARO'S ADDED INSULT TO

20:48.146 --> 20:49.448
INJURY, CLAIMING THOSE FIRES IN

20:49.514 --> 20:51.984
THE AMAZON WERE FALSE FLAGS,

20:52.050 --> 20:53.552
ACCUSING OUTSIDERS OF BEING PART

20:53.619 --> 20:55.420
OF A NEFARIOUS PLOT TO SEIZE

20:55.487 --> 20:56.655
BRAZIL'S JUNGLES, AND DIRECTLY

20:56.722 --> 20:58.924
ACCUSING LEONARDO DICAPRIO OF

20:58.991 --> 21:01.493
FUNDING ARSON IN THE AMAZON.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.595
WHICH IS ABSURD!

21:03.662 --> 21:05.263
WHERE WOULD LEO FIND THE TIME TO

21:05.330 --> 21:05.864
DO THAT BETWEEN HIS BUSY FILM

21:05.931 --> 21:10.335
SCHEDULE, HIS DAILY YACHT FUCK,

21:10.402 --> 21:10.969
AND HAVING A BIG LAUGH AT EVERY

21:11.036 --> 21:13.171
TWEET ABOUT HIS MAY DECEMEBER

21:13.238 --> 21:13.605
LOVE LIFE.

21:13.672 --> 21:14.239
"MAN, THE INTERNET GOT ME

21:14.306 --> 21:17.042
AGAIN!"

21:17.109 --> 21:18.410
LEO SHOUTS TO THE RICHEST PEOPLE

21:18.477 --> 21:19.111
ON THE PLANET OVER A BOTTLE OF

21:19.177 --> 21:19.745
WINE THAT COSTS MORE THAN YOUR

21:19.811 --> 21:24.483
RENT.

21:24.549 --> 21:25.150
BUT PERHAPS THE DEFINING

21:25.217 --> 21:25.684
CATASTROPHE OF BOLSONARO'S

21:25.751 --> 21:26.485
PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN HIS HANDLING

21:26.551 --> 21:27.319
OF THE COVID PANDEMIC.

21:27.386 --> 21:31.757
BRAZIL HAS SUFFERED MASSIVELY --

21:31.823 --> 21:32.391
OVER 34 MILLION CASES, AND OVER

21:32.457 --> 21:32.891
685,000 DEATHS.

21:32.958 --> 21:37.162
AND RIGHT FROM THE START, HE

21:37.229 --> 21:38.764
REFUSED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY,

21:38.830 --> 21:39.398
INITIALLY DISMISSING COVID AS "A

21:39.464 --> 21:42.734
LITTLE FLU," AND THEN, ONCE THE

21:42.801 --> 21:43.301
DEATH TOLL STARTED RISING,

21:43.368 --> 21:44.403
SHRUGGING OFF RESPONSIBILITY IN

21:44.469 --> 21:49.775
THE MOST DICKISH POSSIBLE WAY.

21:49.841 --> 21:50.676
>> EVERYTHING IS ABOUT THE

21:50.742 --> 21:53.111
PANDEMIC NOWADAYS.

21:53.178 --> 21:54.446
WE HAVE GOT TO STOP WITH THIS.

21:54.513 --> 21:54.946
I'M SORRY FOR THE DEAD.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.548
I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE ALL GOING

21:56.615 --> 21:57.749
TO DIE ONE DAY.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.384
EVERYBODY HERE IS GOING TO DIE.

21:59.451 --> 22:00.285
WE HAVE TO STOP BEING A COUNTRY

22:00.352 --> 22:02.120
OF SISSIES.

22:02.187 --> 22:02.854
>> John: WOW.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.157
THAT IS MONUMENTALLY SHITTY.

22:05.223 --> 22:06.124
I GOTTA SAY -- AMERICA'S COVID

22:06.191 --> 22:09.061
RESPONSE LEFT A LOT TO BE

22:09.127 --> 22:11.063
DESIRED, BUT AT LEAST THE CDC'S

22:11.129 --> 22:12.397
SLOGAN WAS NEVER "WHAT ARE YOU

22:12.464 --> 22:13.799
COMPLAINING ABOUT, DEATH COMES

22:13.865 --> 22:15.233
FOR ALL OF US, MAN UP AND DIE IN

22:15.300 --> 22:18.136
A HOLE."

22:18.203 --> 22:19.404
BUT BOLSONARO DIDN'T JUST

22:19.471 --> 22:21.106
ABDICATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

22:21.173 --> 22:22.140
FIGHTING COVID, HE ACTIVELY MADE

22:22.207 --> 22:23.809
IT WORSE, ATTACKING GOVERNORS

22:23.875 --> 22:25.343
AND ANYONE ELSE WHO PROMOTED

22:25.410 --> 22:27.345
SHUTDOWNS OR SOCIAL DISTANCING.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.281
IN FACT, TO THE EXTENT THAT

22:29.347 --> 22:32.017
LOCKDOWN ORDERS WERE ISSUED AT

22:32.084 --> 22:33.018
ALL IN BRAZILIAN CITIES, THEY

22:33.085 --> 22:35.687
SOMETIMES CAME FROM VERY

22:35.754 --> 22:36.988
SURPRISING PLACES.

22:37.055 --> 22:39.191
>> THE SITUATION HAS BECOME SO

22:39.257 --> 22:41.126
SERIOUS THAT THE DRUG GANGS THAT

22:41.193 --> 22:43.095
RULE THIS SLUM AND OTHER SLUMS

22:43.161 --> 22:45.697
IN RIO DE JANEIRO HAVE DECREED A

22:45.764 --> 22:46.765
LOCKDOWN, AND THEY HAVE

22:46.832 --> 22:48.500
FORBIDDEN ALL CLANDESTINE

22:48.567 --> 22:49.201
PARTIES FROM HAPPENING.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.269
>> John: IT'S TRUE!

22:51.336 --> 22:52.571
DRUG GANGS ENDED UP BEING MORE

22:52.637 --> 22:53.438
RESPONSIBLE WHEN IT CAME TO

22:53.505 --> 22:54.005
COVID THAN THE BRAZILIAN

22:54.072 --> 22:56.108
GOVERNMENT!

22:56.174 --> 22:57.209
ALTHOUGH, LET'S NOT GIVE THEM

22:57.275 --> 22:58.410
TOO MUCH CREDIT FOR BANNING

22:58.477 --> 23:00.579
PARTIES -- YOU KNOW WHAT'S

23:00.645 --> 23:01.446
PRETTY APPEALING WHEN YOU'RE

23:01.513 --> 23:02.080
STUCK INSIDE WITH NOTHING TO DO

23:02.147 --> 23:02.514
AND NOWHERE TO GO?

23:02.581 --> 23:05.283
DRUGS.

23:05.350 --> 23:06.918
AND WHAT'S SO FRUSTRATING IS

23:06.985 --> 23:09.287
THAT BRAZIL WAS

23:09.354 --> 23:10.021
BETTER-POSITIONED THAN MANY

23:10.088 --> 23:11.223
OTHER COUNTRIES TO HANDLE COVID.

23:11.289 --> 23:13.492
IT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF

23:13.558 --> 23:15.060
SUCCESSFUL INOCULATION DRIVES,

23:15.127 --> 23:17.729
STARRING THEIR BELOVED VACCINE

23:17.796 --> 23:19.030
MASCOT, ZE GOTINHA, WHO, AT

23:19.097 --> 23:20.132
BEST, LOOKS LIKE A SUPER SPERM

23:20.198 --> 23:23.101
AND AT WORST, A KLAN MEMBER ALL

23:23.168 --> 23:24.569
DRESSED UP FOR JAZZERCISE.

23:24.636 --> 23:28.106
AND YET, BOLSONARO NOT ONLY

23:28.173 --> 23:28.740
SOWED DOUBTS ABOUT THE EFFICACY

23:28.807 --> 23:29.975
OF VACCINES, HE DELAYED ORDERING

23:30.041 --> 23:31.610
DOSES FOR MONTHS.

23:31.676 --> 23:33.078
IN FACT, LAST YEAR, PFIZER

23:33.145 --> 23:34.546
APPARENTLY REACHED OUT TO THE

23:34.613 --> 23:36.148
BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT 81 TIMES,

23:36.214 --> 23:37.582
TRYING TO SET UP A DEAL TO

23:37.649 --> 23:38.817
PROVIDE DOSES OF VACCINES, BUT

23:38.884 --> 23:41.219
MOST OF THE TIME GOT NO ANSWER.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.621
AND SOME OF THOSE EMAILS FROM

23:42.687 --> 23:45.590
PFIZER WERE JUST SAD.

23:45.657 --> 23:46.558
ONE READ: HOPE ALL IS WELL WITH

23:46.625 --> 23:47.359
YOU!

23:47.425 --> 23:49.594
I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT

23:49.661 --> 23:51.129
YOU RECEIVED YESTERDAY A

23:51.196 --> 23:52.297
COMMUNICATION SENT ON BEHALF OF

23:52.364 --> 23:53.231
THE PRESIDENT OF PFIZER, WITH

23:53.298 --> 23:55.233
THE UPDATED PROPOSAL OF A

23:55.300 --> 23:55.801
POSSIBLE SUPPLY OF COVID-19

23:55.867 --> 23:57.435
VACCINES.

23:57.502 --> 23:59.471
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW?"

23:59.538 --> 24:01.306
AND COME ON, PFIZER!

24:01.373 --> 24:03.208
IF YOU'RE GETTING GHOSTED, YOU

24:03.275 --> 24:05.076
GOTTA BE MORE BLUNT THAN THAT.

24:05.143 --> 24:06.511
SOMETHING LIKE "ATTENTION

24:06.578 --> 24:07.779
DICKHEADS: YOUR COUNTRY HAS

24:07.846 --> 24:09.347
COVID, WE HAVE A VACCINE, LET'S

24:09.414 --> 24:13.785
DO THIS THING."

24:13.852 --> 24:14.586
OR EVEN: "EARTH TO PRESIDENT

24:14.653 --> 24:16.121
BITCH: STOP SUBTWEETING LEONARDO

24:16.188 --> 24:16.822
DICAPRIO AND ANSWER YOUR FUCKING

24:16.888 --> 24:18.690
PHONE."

24:18.757 --> 24:20.625
AND THE THING IS, IT'S NOT LIKE

24:20.692 --> 24:22.327
BRAZILIANS DIDN'T WANT VACCINES

24:22.394 --> 24:23.361
-- PROVEN BY THE FACT THAT, ONCE

24:23.428 --> 24:25.263
THEY FINALLY BECAME AVAILABLE,

24:25.330 --> 24:27.766
VIRTUALLY 100% OF THE ADULT

24:27.833 --> 24:29.935
POPULATIONS IN RIO AND SAO PAULO

24:30.001 --> 24:31.670
GOT FULLY VACCINATED, A NUMBER

24:31.736 --> 24:35.273
NO AMERICAN CITY HAS HIT.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.375
AND THE COVID DEBACLE WOULD BE

24:37.442 --> 24:38.677
ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO BE DONE

24:38.743 --> 24:39.744
WITH BOLSONARO, BUT THERE'S SO

24:39.811 --> 24:47.452
MUCH MORE -- FROM HIS OPEN

24:47.519 --> 24:49.654
DESPITE RUNNING ON AN

24:49.721 --> 24:50.956
ANTICORRUPTION PLATFORM, THEY'VE

24:51.022 --> 24:51.590
BEEN, ENGULFED IN A GROWING

24:51.656 --> 24:57.996
NUMBER OF GRAMM CRIMINAL

24:58.063 --> 25:03.068
INVESTIGATIONS.

25:03.134 --> 25:03.702
INCLUDING, AT ONE POINT,

25:03.768 --> 25:04.769
THREATENING TO PUNCH A REPORTER

25:04.836 --> 25:07.739
IN THE FACE, TO THE FACT THAT,

25:07.806 --> 25:08.206
DESPITE RUNNING ON AN

25:08.273 --> 25:08.807
ANTI-CORRUPTION PLATFORM FOUR

25:08.874 --> 25:09.441
YEARS AGO, HE'S NOW HAD MULTIPLE

25:09.507 --> 25:10.075
ALLEGATIONS LEVELED AGAINST HIM

25:10.141 --> 25:10.442
AND HIS FAMILY.

25:10.508 --> 25:11.076
IT'S NO WONDER HE'S TRAILING IN

25:11.142 --> 25:11.343
THE POLLS.

25:11.409 --> 25:11.877
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT

25:11.943 --> 25:12.377
BOLSONARO DOESN'T HAVE

25:12.444 --> 25:12.978
SUPPORTERS -- BECAUSE HE DOES,

25:13.044 --> 25:15.080
AND THEY CAN BE INTENSE.

25:15.146 --> 25:16.548
>> THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS LINED

25:16.615 --> 25:19.084
UP IN FRONT OF THIS GYM NEXT TO

25:19.150 --> 25:21.319
RIO DE JANEIRO'S ICONIC MARACAÃA

25:21.386 --> 25:23.622
FOOTBALL STADIUM.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.556
INSIDE, CROWDS WEARING THE

25:24.623 --> 25:26.825
COLORS OF THE BRAZILIAN FLAG

25:26.892 --> 25:27.792
CHEER FOR PRESIDENT JAIR

25:27.859 --> 25:28.360
BOLSONARO, CALLING HIM THE

25:28.426 --> 25:36.668
MESSIAH AND THE MYTH.

25:36.735 --> 25:37.936
>> John: I LOVE THAT MAN.

25:38.003 --> 25:39.004
I LOVE HIS OUTFIT.

25:39.070 --> 25:40.205
I LOVE HIS FACEPAINT.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.606
I LOVE THE WAY HE KIND OF LOOKS

25:41.673 --> 25:42.307
LIKE THE HULK LOSING HIS SHIT AT

25:42.374 --> 25:44.009
A GREEN BAY PACKERS GAME.

25:44.075 --> 25:45.277
BUT WHAT I LOVE MOST OF ALL IS

25:45.343 --> 25:46.745
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SECURITY

25:46.811 --> 25:47.679
GUARD OVER HIS SHOULDER,

25:47.746 --> 25:52.684
SCANNING THE CROWD FOR THREATS,

25:52.751 --> 25:53.318
WHILE LOOKING EVERYWHERE BUT

25:53.385 --> 25:53.985
AT THE BRIGHT GREEN MAN IN FRONT

25:54.052 --> 25:54.586
OF HIM, SCREAMING SO HARD HE

25:54.653 --> 25:56.788
MIGHT EXPLODE.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.823
AND BOLSONARO'S BEEN VERY

25:58.890 --> 25:59.624
DELIBERATELY LAYING THE

25:59.691 --> 26:00.926
GROUNDWORK WITH HIS SUPPORTERS

26:00.992 --> 26:02.527
FOR AN EVENTUAL TRUMP-STYLE

26:02.594 --> 26:03.895
REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE ELECTION

26:03.962 --> 26:05.630
RESULTS -- EVEN POINTING TO OUR

26:05.697 --> 26:07.098
LAST ELECTION AS A CAUTIONARY

26:07.165 --> 26:10.902
TALE FOR BRAZILIANS.

26:10.969 --> 26:12.170
>> WHAT HAPPENED IN THE AMERICAN

26:12.237 --> 26:13.972
ELECTIONS.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.307
BASICALLY, THE PROBLEM, THE

26:15.373 --> 26:16.841
CAUSE OF THIS CRISIS WAS THE

26:16.908 --> 26:19.344
LACK OF TRUST IN THE VOTE.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.645
>> THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO VOTED

26:20.712 --> 26:21.780
3, 4 TIMES.

26:21.846 --> 26:22.681
DEAD PEOPLE VOTED.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.816
IT WAS A MESS.

26:24.883 --> 26:25.984
>> John: GREAT, SO THAT'S THE

26:26.051 --> 26:27.619
JANUARY 6TH OP-ED ABSOLUTELY NO

26:27.686 --> 26:29.087
ONE NEEDED, FROM THE MAN NO ONE

26:29.154 --> 26:30.655
WANTED TO HEAR IT FROM, AND FROM

26:30.722 --> 26:32.958
THE CAMERA ANGLE ABSOLUTELY NO

26:33.024 --> 26:34.459
ONE DESERVES.

26:34.526 --> 26:35.393
HE'S SAYING HIS STUPID OPINIONS

26:35.460 --> 26:36.895
OUT LOUD, YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE

26:36.962 --> 26:38.563
TO GO HUNTING FOR THEM RIGHT UP

26:38.630 --> 26:41.366
HIS NOSTRILS.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.500
BOLSONARO'S BEEN GOING OUT OF

26:42.567 --> 26:44.202
HIS WAY TO UNDERMINE FAITH IN

26:44.269 --> 26:46.271
BRAZIL'S ELECTION SYSTEM,

26:46.338 --> 26:47.138
SUGGESTING JUDGES AND OFFICIALS

26:47.205 --> 26:49.240
ARE TRYING TO SABOTAGE HIS

26:49.307 --> 26:50.342
REELECTION, AND FEARMONGERING

26:50.408 --> 26:51.710
ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S ELECTRONIC

26:51.776 --> 26:53.411
VOTING MACHINES -- MACHINES,

26:53.478 --> 26:55.547
INCIDENTALLY, WHICH ARE EVEN THE

26:55.613 --> 26:56.915
SUBJECT OF ASMR ELECTION PSA'S

26:56.982 --> 26:59.851
LIKE THIS ONE:

26:59.918 --> 27:02.287
>> ELECTRONIC BALLOT BOX ASMR.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.421
DO YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS

27:03.488 --> 27:05.991
ABOUT THE ELECTIONS?

27:06.057 --> 27:06.524
WE'RE HERE TO MAKE THINGS

27:06.591 --> 27:09.794
SIMPLE.

27:09.861 --> 27:10.996
AND TODAY'S QUESTION IS: WHY

27:11.062 --> 27:12.263
VOTE?

27:12.330 --> 27:13.832
>> John: HORNY.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.200
YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY THERE ARE

27:15.266 --> 27:16.568
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING

27:16.634 --> 27:18.370
THEIR OWN PERSONAL SEXUAL

27:18.436 --> 27:19.471
AWAKENINGS, AND I'M GUESSING

27:19.537 --> 27:21.306
TODAY AT LEAST ONE OF THEM

27:21.373 --> 27:23.141
DISCOVERED THAT SOFTLY FONDLING

27:23.208 --> 27:24.309
BRAZILIAN VOTING MACHINES IS

27:24.376 --> 27:30.348
APPARENTLY THEIR THING.

27:30.415 --> 27:31.149
WELCOME TO THE REST OF YOUR

27:31.216 --> 27:31.950
LIFE.

27:32.017 --> 27:32.550
BUT BRAZIL'S VOTING MACHINES

27:32.617 --> 27:33.084
AREN'T JUST QUIETLY EROTIC,

27:33.151 --> 27:34.119
THEY'RE ALSO WIDELY SEEN AS

27:34.185 --> 27:35.120
SECURE.

27:35.186 --> 27:36.087
THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE

27:36.154 --> 27:37.822
INTERNET, WHICH MAKES THEM ALL

27:37.889 --> 27:39.157
BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO HACK.

27:39.224 --> 27:40.558
AND IT'S WORTH KNOWING THAT,

27:40.625 --> 27:41.926
SINCE THEIR INTRODUCTION IN

27:41.993 --> 27:43.028
1996, AUTHORITIES HAVE NEVER

27:43.094 --> 27:45.897
FOUND ANY EVIDENCE OF WIDESPREAD

27:45.964 --> 27:47.065
FRAUD.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.566
YET BOLSANARO'S REPEATEDLY

27:48.633 --> 27:49.868
ATTACKED THE MACHINES AS

27:49.934 --> 27:51.436
CROOKED, CLAIMING HIS MARGIN OF

27:51.503 --> 27:52.971
VICTORY IN 2018 ACTUALLY SHOULD

27:53.038 --> 27:54.973
HAVE BEEN LARGER.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.242
HE EVEN SUBJECTED A ROOM FULL OF

27:57.308 --> 27:59.411
DIPLOMATS TO A 45-MINUTE

27:59.477 --> 28:00.245
POWERPOINT PRESENTATION ACCUSING

28:00.311 --> 28:01.513
BRAZIL'S ELECTIONS OF BEING

28:01.579 --> 28:03.281
RIGGED.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.151
AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS,

28:06.217 --> 28:07.118
PARTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL AGREE

28:07.185 --> 28:09.487
TO ANYTHING IF YOU THREATEN THEM

28:09.554 --> 28:10.755
WITH A 45-MINUTE POWERPOINT

28:10.822 --> 28:12.157
PRESENTATION.

28:12.223 --> 28:13.758
IN OUR OFFICE, WE HAVE AN EMAIL

28:13.825 --> 28:15.894
SECURITY SEMINAR ONCE A YEAR,

28:15.960 --> 28:16.528
AND THIS YEAR I BROKE MY LAPTOP

28:16.594 --> 28:18.463
WITH A HAMMER JUST SO I COULD

28:18.530 --> 28:19.864
CLAIM IT DIDN'T APPLY TO ME.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.767
IT WAS THE RIGHT CALL AND I'D DO

28:22.834 --> 28:23.635
IT AGAIN.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.103
AND LOOK: I DON'T WANT TO WASTE

28:25.170 --> 28:26.571
TIME KNOCKING DOWN EVERY ONE OF

28:26.638 --> 28:28.339
BOLSONARO'S COMPLAINTS, BECAUSE

28:28.406 --> 28:29.641
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IN

28:29.707 --> 28:31.509
RAISING THESE OBJECTIONS IN THE

28:31.576 --> 28:34.079
RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION, HIS

28:34.145 --> 28:35.580
INTENTION ISN'T TO MAXIMIZE THE

28:35.647 --> 28:36.614
SECURITY OF THE VOTE, BUT TO

28:36.681 --> 28:37.315
MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF DISTRUST

28:37.382 --> 28:39.250
THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN IT.

28:39.317 --> 28:40.385
AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN

28:40.452 --> 28:43.421
LISTENING TO HIS BULLSHIT.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.256
>> IF THE ELECTIONS ARE FAIR, HE

28:45.323 --> 28:46.925
WINS IN THE FIRST ROUND, ONLY IN

28:46.991 --> 28:48.827
THE FIRST ROUND.

28:48.893 --> 28:49.794
>> HE WILL ONLY LOSE THE

28:49.861 --> 28:50.995
ELECTION IF THERE IS FRAUD, AND

28:51.062 --> 28:52.397
THE PEOPLE WILL TAKE TO THE

28:52.464 --> 28:53.231
STREETS TO STOP THAT FROM

28:53.298 --> 28:54.332
HAPPENING.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.400
>> John: SEE, THAT'S

28:55.467 --> 28:56.935
INTERESTING, BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK

28:57.001 --> 28:57.869
AT THAT MAN YOU'D THINK, "HE

28:57.936 --> 29:00.004
LOVES BRAZIL."

29:00.071 --> 29:01.039
BUT IF YOU "LISTEN" TO HIM,

29:01.106 --> 29:02.073
YOU'D LEARN "HE'S WILLING TO

29:02.140 --> 29:04.042
BURN HIS COUNTRY DOWN BASED ON A

29:04.109 --> 29:04.809
FLIMSILY-LAID CONSPIRACY

29:04.876 --> 29:05.844
THEORY."

29:05.910 --> 29:07.112
BUT I GUESS THAT DUALITY IS JUST

29:07.178 --> 29:08.446
PART OF THE BOUNDLESS MYSTERY

29:08.513 --> 29:09.814
AND CONTRADICTION THAT MAKES

29:09.881 --> 29:14.385
HUMAN BEINGS THE ABSOLUTE WORST.

29:14.452 --> 29:16.221
AND GIVEN BOLSONARO'S RHETORIC,

29:16.287 --> 29:18.423
IT'S NO WONDER THERE'VE ALREADY

29:18.490 --> 29:19.324
BEEN OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.793
ONE LULA SUPPORTER WAS KILLED

29:21.860 --> 29:23.228
WHEN A BOLSONARO SUPPORTER

29:23.294 --> 29:25.130
INVADED HIS LULA-THEMED BIRTHDAY

29:25.196 --> 29:26.397
PARTY AND SHOT HIM, WHILE

29:26.464 --> 29:26.865
SHOUTING THAT "ALL PT

29:26.931 --> 29:28.533
PARTISANS" -- THAT IS,

29:28.600 --> 29:29.801
SUPPORTERS OF LULA'S POLITICAL

29:29.868 --> 29:31.369
PARTY -- "WILL DIE."

29:31.436 --> 29:33.872
SO THINGS ARE VERY TENSE RIGHT

29:33.938 --> 29:35.140
NOW IN BRAZIL -- AND THAT'S

29:35.206 --> 29:36.608
BEFORE YOU CONSIDER JUST HOW

29:36.674 --> 29:37.242
CLOSE BOLSONARO IS TO THE ARMED

29:37.308 --> 29:40.378
FORCES THERE.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.946
NOT ONLY IS HE EX-MILITARY, AND

29:42.013 --> 29:43.948
NOT ONLY HAS HE EXPRESSED

29:44.015 --> 29:44.616
ADMIRATION FOR THE MILITARY

29:44.682 --> 29:47.485
DICTATORSHIP THAT RAN THE

29:47.552 --> 29:48.119
COUNTRY UNTIL 1985, HIS

29:48.186 --> 29:49.587
GOVERNMENT IS ALSO HEAVILY

29:49.654 --> 29:52.157
STOCKED WITH MILITARY PERSONNEL.

29:52.223 --> 29:53.391
AND SOME LEADERS OF BRAZIL'S

29:53.458 --> 29:55.393
ARMED FORCES ARE NOW ECHOING HIS

29:55.460 --> 29:57.295
DOUBTS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF

29:57.362 --> 29:58.530
THE ELECTIONS.

29:58.596 --> 30:00.865
ALL OF WHICH HAS LED SOME IN

30:00.932 --> 30:02.667
BRAZIL TO UNDERSTANDABLY WORRY

30:02.734 --> 30:07.572
ABOUT WHAT LIES AHEAD.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.407
>> THIS FLIRTING OF PRESIDENT

30:09.474 --> 30:11.509
BOLSONARO WITH A COUP IS NOT A

30:11.576 --> 30:14.345
RECENT THING IT'S AN OLD THING.

30:14.412 --> 30:15.413
THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM ARE

30:15.480 --> 30:17.415
WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.384
JUST LIKE THE SUPPORTERS OF

30:19.450 --> 30:20.084
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHEN THE

30:20.151 --> 30:25.056
CAPITOL WAS INVADED.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.391
I HAVE NO DOUBT, I HAVE EVEN

30:26.457 --> 30:27.358
WRITTEN ABOUT IT, THAT HERE IN

30:27.425 --> 30:29.527
BRAZIL, WE WILL HAVE A TRAGIC,

30:29.594 --> 30:31.062
DRAMATIC REPETITION OF WHAT

30:31.129 --> 30:32.564
HAPPENED THERE.

30:32.630 --> 30:33.364
>> John: YEAH, EXCEPT,

30:33.431 --> 30:35.333
CRUCIALLY, IT COULD BE MUCH

30:35.400 --> 30:37.302
WORSE THERE -- BECAUSE LUCKILY

30:37.368 --> 30:38.570
FOR US, TRUMP'S ALLIES WERE

30:38.636 --> 30:39.904
GENERALLY LIMITED TO A SHIRTLESS

30:39.971 --> 30:41.773
MAN IN A FUR HAT, A

30:41.839 --> 30:43.808
PERPETUALLY-HOARSE PILLOW BARON,

30:43.875 --> 30:47.045
AND SOME OF HIS DUMBER CHILDREN.

30:47.111 --> 30:49.480
BUT BOLSONARO HAS SIGNIFICANT

30:49.547 --> 30:50.715
MILITARY SUPPORT, AND THERE IS

30:50.782 --> 30:51.583
SOME QUESTION OF WHAT THEY MIGHT

30:51.649 --> 30:54.586
DO IN THE EVENT OF AN UPRISING.

30:54.652 --> 30:55.086
WHICH RAISES THE STAKES

30:55.153 --> 30:56.621
SIGNIFICANTLY.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.122
GENERALLY, WHEN SOMEONE

30:58.189 --> 30:59.624
THREATENS DEMOCRACY IT'S A LOT

30:59.691 --> 31:00.525
EASIER TO SAY "YOU AND WHAT

31:00.592 --> 31:02.327
ARMY?"

31:02.393 --> 31:03.127
WHEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

31:03.194 --> 31:03.695
THAT PERSON DOESN'T HAVE AN

31:03.761 --> 31:06.664
ACTUAL ARMY BEHIND THEM.

31:06.731 --> 31:08.166
THE POINT IS, FOR BRAZIL,

31:08.233 --> 31:10.034
THERE'S A LOT ON THE LINE HERE.

31:10.101 --> 31:11.436
AND RIGHT NOW, IT SEEMS THE MOST

31:11.502 --> 31:13.071
LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT NO ONE

31:13.137 --> 31:15.206
WILL WIN OUTRIGHT NEXT SUNDAY,

31:15.273 --> 31:16.507
MEANING BOTH BOLSONARO AND LULA

31:16.574 --> 31:20.311
HEAD TO A RUN-OFF ON OCTOBER 30.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.312
BUT THE WEEKS AHEAD COULD BE

31:21.379 --> 31:23.881
EXTREMELY NERVE-RACKING.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.116
AND THE FACT IS, IF BOLSONARO

31:25.183 --> 31:26.918
EVENTUALLY LOSES AND CHOOSES TO

31:26.985 --> 31:28.519
FIGHT THE RESULTS, IT'S GOING TO

31:28.586 --> 31:31.022
TEST THE STRENGTH OF BRAZIL'S

31:31.089 --> 31:32.690
RELATIVELY YOUNG DEMOCRACY.

31:32.757 --> 31:35.126
SO TO THE PEOPLE THERE WHO ARE

31:35.193 --> 31:35.693
WORRIED RIGHT NOW, LET ME

31:35.760 --> 31:36.761
ADDRESS YOU IN THE TWO LANGUAGES

31:36.828 --> 31:38.997
THAT I KNOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND:

31:39.063 --> 31:43.635
PORTUGUESE...

31:43.701 --> 31:44.569
AND OF COURSE THE LANGUAGE OF

31:44.636 --> 31:45.169
THE CHUCK.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.873
SO PLEASE -- AND BEAR WITH ME.
