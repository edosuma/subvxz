IfI had to pick one word
to sum up this case,

11:11.470 --> 11:12.937
it would be "missing."

11:12.970 --> 11:16.633
Five girls went missing
in 2013 and two now,

11:16.670 --> 11:18.308
but other things
are missing, too.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.900
The weapon used to knock out
the girls is missing.

11:20.940 --> 11:23.943
Police tore Tobias' life apart
and never found it.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.005
The kill site is missing.

11:26.050 --> 11:28.416
Tobias lived in Manor Hall
with a roommate.

11:28.450 --> 11:29.815
It's not exactly a place

11:29.850 --> 11:31.340
he could've frozen a body
in liquid nitrogen

11:31.390 --> 11:32.755
without anyone noticing.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.519
I hate that anyone more
is being hurt,

11:34.560 --> 11:37.028
but maybe the silver lining
is the truth will finally
come out.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.482
The truth?

11:38.530 --> 11:39.622
The truth is that
Lauren Key's

11:39.660 --> 11:42.595
sexual-harassment report
against Dr. Adrian McCaffrey

11:42.630 --> 11:44.518
is the biggest missing
piece of all.

11:44.570 --> 11:45.867
We have it now, of course,

11:45.900 --> 11:47.333
but it is missing

11:47.370 --> 11:49.531
from the official case
in 2013.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.364
I was a student
at Brockton

11:52.410 --> 11:54.674
while the original murders
were happening,

11:54.710 --> 11:56.769
and everyone knew

11:56.810 --> 11:59.938
McCaffrey liked sleeping
with girls half his age.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.484
Were all of the victims
students of his that
turned him down?

12:03.520 --> 12:05.909
Both of the new victims
had him as a professor.

12:05.950 --> 12:08.111
McCaffrey is the one police
should be talking to.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.822
Jenny Marciniak was kidnapped
12 hours ago?

12:10.860 --> 12:12.589
My client has
an ironclad alibi.

12:13.330 --> 12:14.695
What's Dr. McCaffrey's?

12:14.730 --> 12:17.494
I was in my office,
grading my papers,

12:17.530 --> 12:19.361
just like I always do.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.039
Can anyone corroborate that?
This whole thing
is ridiculous.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.264
I shouldn't be a suspect.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.164
Sir, you are not
officially a suspect.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.576
Oh, sure, I'm just having
a little chat with the FBI.

12:27.610 --> 12:29.908
It's just a-a-a few
questions, like, um,

12:29.950 --> 12:32.077
about that _
sexual-harassment complaint.

12:32.110 --> 12:34.715
Ah. You're one of those,
aren't you?

12:34.750 --> 12:36.638
You've listened to
that podcast.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.581
You should know
that I am suing that woman
for defamation.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.088
I'm just curious why you think
the college didn't disclose

12:42.120 --> 12:44.657
the allegation during
the original investigation.

12:44.690 --> 12:47.557
Because it was untrue.
Okay.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.192
Hang on. So...

12:49.230 --> 12:52.859
So you deny that one of the
victims had reported that,

12:52.900 --> 12:55.061
uh, you had said,

12:55.100 --> 12:58.001
uh, "she looked good
in her skirt,

12:58.040 --> 12:59.871
"and that, if she was
interested in a better grade,

12:59.910 --> 13:02.947
"she should see you
in your office after class"?

13:03.380 --> 13:04.779
**

13:04.810 --> 13:08.769
I acknowledge
that a complaint was made.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.583
I also acknowledge

13:10.620 --> 13:13.612
that I had called her paper
on The Decameron derivative,

13:13.660 --> 13:15.457
and I graded her
accordingly.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.287
She was just
getting back at me.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.252
All of the victims
have been your students.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.929
I mean, you have to admit
that's a little weird, right?

13:21.960 --> 13:23.621
No, I don't have to admit
anything.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.297
I teach English 101.

13:25.330 --> 13:26.797
It would be harder
for you to find

13:26.840 --> 13:28.364
a student at Brockton
that I haven't taught.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.936
And the rumors you were
sleeping with students?

13:29.970 --> 13:32.234
You sound
just like my ex-wife.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.339
Do you have
my divorce agreement

13:33.380 --> 13:34.608
in that file of yours,
as well?

13:34.640 --> 13:36.733

you would know

And I got everything
I wanted in the divorce

13:43.590 --> 13:45.148

The B&B in West Virginia

26:39.760 --> 26:41.728
can provide documentation that
McCaffrey and his girlfriend

26:41.760 --> 26:43.819
were there the weekend
Lauren Key was murdered.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.168
Which corroborates the photos
his girlfriend gave us.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.895
The reason we looked at
McCaffrey in the first place

26:47.940 --> 26:49.532
_ was because of
his connection to Key.

26:49.570 --> 26:52.107

that Jenny Marciniak

he never uses.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.036

Maybe the killer knew that

26:56.080 --> 26:57.775
and put Marciniak there
so we'd blame him.

that he was grading papers
the night Marciniak was taken.

was framed after all.
