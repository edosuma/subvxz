00:01.069 --> 00:02.336
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:03.337
What's Metro doing here?

00:03.337 --> 00:04.805
Metro would be
a good fit for Tim.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.574
There's an opening
in Metro.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.077
Lieutenant Pine just called me,
and I'm going over.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.144
That's great.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.145
Monica.
What are you doing here?

00:11.145 --> 00:12.313
Elijah Stone is my client.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.481
Del Monte:
Elijah's attorney?

00:13.481 --> 00:14.548
We used to be engaged.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.250
Hi.
I'm his mother.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.318
The boxes?

00:17.318 --> 00:18.919
Your mother sold me
snake oil?

00:18.919 --> 00:20.588
This is my boss' wife.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.856
Do you have any idea what this
could do to my career?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.058
Goodbye.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.731
Alright. Turn to your left.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.866
Turn to your right.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.402
You know, the boardwalk
is a public place.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.769
I have a right to perform.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.037
Well, it does not
give you the right

00:37.037 --> 00:39.873
to pick your
audience's pockets.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.210
You know
I can get out of these, right?

00:42.210 --> 00:44.378
You can try.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.117
Voilà.
I'm a master escape artist.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.889
Cute. Let's go.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.058
You know,
no cage can hold me.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.128
Yeah?

01:00.128 --> 01:01.229
Alright.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.297
What about this cage?

01:03.297 --> 01:06.767
A magician
is always prepared.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.443
How did you think
that was gonna work?

01:15.443 --> 01:16.877
Yeah. No.
I didn't get that far.

01:16.877 --> 01:20.314
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

01:20.314 --> 01:25.353
♪ I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do ♪

01:26.920 --> 01:28.289
No. You said that already.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.524
And I already
explained it to you.

01:33.994 --> 01:37.231
That's ridiculous.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.733
No. Absolutely not.

01:39.733 --> 01:40.968
No. I'm done.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.170
No--

01:42.170 --> 01:43.637
I am done.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.006
Your mom?

01:46.006 --> 01:47.141
How'd you know?

01:47.141 --> 01:49.109
Your shoulders
are touching your ears.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.311
What's the latest?

01:50.311 --> 01:51.612
She is, uh, devastated

01:51.612 --> 01:52.980
that she hasn't been
invited to the wedding.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.682
Did you tell her we're
not doing a big thing?

01:54.682 --> 01:56.284
We literally have
two guests.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.451
Explained all that.
Doesn't matter.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.952
Still a knife
through her heart.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.088
Look, if it helps,
I don't mind inviting her.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.657
No. No way. No. It's...

02:03.657 --> 02:04.792
It's not even
about the wedding.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.662
She wants me to pay her
not to come-- $10,000.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.763
What?
I know.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.532
Don't worry.
She is not coming.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.801
I will not let her
ruin our wedding.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.169
Mm.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.814
Oh.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.650
Did I miss it?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.452
It's cute.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.786
Why are you up so early?

02:32.786 --> 02:35.356
I was gonna get a photo
of your reaction.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.057
There's a Metro
training today.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.459
As the newbie, it's my job

02:38.459 --> 02:40.561
to, uh, haul in the gear
and the ammo.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.129
Yeah, the newbie.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.564
The boot.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.399
I'm a sergeant.
Mnh-mnh.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.535
You're still a boot
in my book.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.837
Oh. Hey.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.572
Are you
just getting home?

02:51.572 --> 02:53.474
Must've been
a heck of a party.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.909
Yeah. Rager.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.478
Mm.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.879
Did I interrupt something?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.748
No. No,
I-I was just heading out.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.483
Uh, can't be late
on my first day.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.817
Mm-hmm.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.019
Bye.
Hey.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.755
You're gonna
be great today.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.723
Knock 'em dead.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.225
Bye.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.664
Good morning.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.632
Whatever.
He is!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.735
Well, of course you'd say that.
Because it's the truth.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.271
Like you've ever
cared about the truth.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.505
Okay, that's enough.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.106
I'd ask where this animosity
is coming from,

03:26.106 --> 03:27.275
but I have an idea.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.776
Okay, this has nothing
to do with our past

03:28.776 --> 03:30.177
and everything to do
with the law.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.946
Let's focus on the law,
then, shall we?

03:32.946 --> 03:34.748
You're presenting
a motion to exclude.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.783
Yes, Your Honor.

03:35.783 --> 03:36.950
You disagree.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.287
Mr. Parker is an eyewitness
to this crime.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.954
He picked the shooter
out of a lineup.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.357
His testimony is essential
to this case.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.758
Ms. Stevens.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.628
You know as well as anyone
eyewitness testimony is flawed,

03:47.628 --> 03:49.730
and this witness
had a gun pointed at him.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.301
High levels of stress
negatively impact memory.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.469
Okay, but any eyewitness
to a crime

03:55.469 --> 03:57.638
has experienced
high levels of stress.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.308
Are we throwing out
the very notion of witnesses?

04:00.308 --> 04:02.142
Do not put words
in my mouth.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.612
Okay.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.080
I'm inclined to side with Monica
on this one.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.716
I'm excluding
his testimony.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.419
Wha-- On-- On what grounds?
That's absurd.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.287
Watch yourself.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.323
I'm sorry.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.892
I meant no disrespect. Um...

04:18.892 --> 04:21.261
I'm gonna need a few minutes
to confer with my team.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.096
Good idea.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.138
Thank you.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.581
Metro Cop:
<i>Okay, you have an active
shooter still at large.</i>

04:40.581 --> 04:43.351
<i>Your job is to locate the
suspect and stop the threat.</i>

04:58.165 --> 04:59.933
Mad Dog: <i>Bang. You're dead.
You're telegraphing.</i>

04:59.933 --> 05:01.134
<i>You're dead. Bang. Dead.</i>

05:01.134 --> 05:03.136
<i>You're dead. Dead.
Bang. Dead.</i>

05:03.136 --> 05:05.939
Bradford, this isn't patrol.
This is Metro.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.709
Major crimes, terrorism,
barricades, hostages.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.277
We are an elite unit.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.613
Your form's got to be
perfect, man.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.349
Alright.
Let's take 10.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.217
What, there's only
one way to clear a room?

05:17.217 --> 05:18.786
That's news to me,

05:18.786 --> 05:20.721
'cause I've actually done this
a million times successfully.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.955
Don't worry.
Happens to everyone.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.224
Metro takes
some getting used to.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.627
You'll get it.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.862
That is the dumbest
ruling I've ever heard.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.297
Yeah, I agree.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.032
But we're gonna
have to make this case

05:32.032 --> 05:33.634
without Parker's testimony.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.136
Do you really think
the jury will convict without?

05:36.136 --> 05:37.571
No. I'm filing
for a continuance.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.972
My team needs to regroup.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.141
Well, I guess
I'm not testifying today.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.643
Oh, it's just as well.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.478
I was gonna have to
hand this one over to you.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.414
Well, there's nothing
like a baby to win over a jury.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.982
Oh, well, we're gonna need
all the help we can get

05:48.982 --> 05:50.484
without that testimony.

05:50.484 --> 05:53.253
Didn't something similar happen
in one of Lopez's cases?

05:53.253 --> 05:54.722
Just like last month.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.190
I'm never assigned to anything
she's investigated.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.692
I remember she was pissed.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.761
She handed your office
a perfect case.

06:00.761 --> 06:04.264
Practically had a bow on it,
and then it fell apart in trial.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.332
It was the same judge.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.534
Well, judges can be fickle.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.868
It's hard to predict
how they'll rule.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.505
But Rivas has been solid
until recently.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.040
True.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.008
You know, I clerked for him
back when I was starting out.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.276
Monica and I both did.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.545
Mind like a scalpel.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.212
Yeah, but he is
getting older.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.614
I mean, if he's
starting to slip,

06:20.614 --> 06:23.451
someone should talk to him
about retiring.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.119
I mean,
maybe a former clerk

06:26.119 --> 06:28.288
who knows how
to cushion the blow.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.024
Oh. Sorry.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.560
Can't stop,
not even for a second.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.127
It's okay.
I've literally been there.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.629
You go.
I'll deal with Rivas.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.030
Thank you. Yeah.

06:37.030 --> 06:40.200
Yes, well, what is going on?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.703
Hm.

06:42.703 --> 06:46.273
Oh! Hey. I just heard
of a new place to try for lunch.

06:46.273 --> 06:49.443
It's Chinese-
Ukrainian fusion.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.478
Is it cheap?

06:50.478 --> 06:52.646
No. But--
What? You're rich.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.981
No, my parents are rich, okay?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.983
And I'm not gonna take
any more of their money.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.885
Since when?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.453
Since my mom
showed me a prototype

06:59.453 --> 07:01.489
of a new Aaron Thorsen
action figure.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.324
Wha-- That sounds awesome.
No, look, I worked hard

07:04.324 --> 07:06.560
to have people
take me seriously as a cop.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.896
I'm not gonna undermine it
for a couple million dollars.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.930
Hold on. I'm sorry.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.264
A couple <i>million?</i>
Yeah.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.133
Dude, if you're
not gonna do it, I will.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.303
Lucy Chen, Fist of Justice.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.639
What are you doing?
Hi.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.141
I'm, uh-- I'm working
on my side hustle.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.976
Oh. What's on your head?

07:22.976 --> 07:25.746
You have a-- You have
a little something on your head.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.080
Uh, no.
It's-- It's nothing.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.917
I just need to get situated
into my new office.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.986
Metro-Police liaison.
Best of both worlds.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.354
That's right.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.995
Well, at least it won't
take too long to move in.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.797
No.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.300
Alright.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.644
She's your mom.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.779
I mean, how can you not have
your mom at your wedding?

07:58.779 --> 08:01.615
She's a narcissist
and a borderline con woman.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.317
She tried to fleece
Sergeant Grey.
Okay, that's not good.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.453
And not even close
to the worst thing she's done.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.721
Yeah,
but she's your mom.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.956
Look, my mom's challenging,

08:08.956 --> 08:11.124
but I can't imagine
getting married without her.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.292
Which probably means

08:12.292 --> 08:14.628
I'll have to get married
in her living room.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.397
Look,
I run into this all the time.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.133
You have
a fundamentally good mom,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.302
so of course
you can't imagine my situation.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.671
You're right.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.173
I don't know what you've
dealt with. I shouldn't judge.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.675
I will.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.409
She's your mother.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.644
She gave you life, man.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.345
We caught you trying to pawn
your mother's jewelry

08:32.345 --> 08:34.481
to buy drugs.
You don't get an opinion.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.554
Seriously, how do you
live on a cop's salary?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.756
It's not that bad.
I mean, we make good money.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.758
My paycheck just evaporates.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.094
I mean, my dry-cleaning bill
alone is $500 a week.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.729
How are we supposed
to afford that?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.063
We're not.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.766
W-What are you dry-cleaning?
Your jeans?

08:52.766 --> 08:53.834
Everything.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.235
Aaron...

08:55.235 --> 08:56.770
do you know
how to do your laundry?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.271
Laundry ruins your clothes.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.774
Dry cleaning is the most
cost-effective in the long run.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.010
What-- Who--
Where did you hear that?

09:03.010 --> 09:04.177
My mom.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.181
Hey, what's up?

09:08.181 --> 09:11.384
I'm at my babysitting job,
and things are weird.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.354
Cosmo says when he woke up,
both of his parents were gone,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.256
and now no one's
answering their phone.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.625
Okay.
We'll be right there.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.438
Thanks for coming.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.206
Yeah, of course.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.842
Cosmo's in here.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.247
These are the cops
I was telling you about.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.281
Hi.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.415
You good?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.784
How's the cereal?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.052
Mm, it's cereal.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.820
Hey, I offered you
unicorn cloud bread.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.056
You're the one
who wanted Wheetie Bran.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.490
Weirdo.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.125
Can I play on the Switch?

09:52.125 --> 09:53.593
Go ahead.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.831
How's he doing?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.566
He hasn't said much.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.069
I know he's scared. He just
doesn't want to admit it.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.305
Did you notice any signs of
forced entry when you got here?

10:05.305 --> 10:07.340
No. I-I used my key
to get in.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.677
I looked around for a little.
Everything seems normal.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.111
No broken windows
or anything.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.412
How well
do you know the family?

10:12.412 --> 10:15.282
I've been working here
for six months.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.185
The dad's a little aloof.
He works a lot.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.452
Some investment thing.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.088
The mom's around more.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.622
She runs a non-profit.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.692
Alright, well, we'll check
with their employers.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.095
Mr. Laetner.
I've been calling you.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.663
You called the police.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.164
Sorry, uh, yeah, um...

10:31.164 --> 10:32.700
I couldn't find anyone.
I was scared.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.135
I'm so sorry.
It's all been so crazy.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.705
We had a family emergency.
My wife had to fly home

10:37.705 --> 10:39.439
to deal with an aunt
who had a heart attack.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.175
I should have told you.
It... completely slipped my mind.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.111
Where did you say
your wife was?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.478
Cincinnati.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.048
Uh, she probably forgot
her phone charger. Typical.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.050
This is all
a-a big misunderstanding.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.519
And where were you?
Your son woke up alone.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.321
I...took her
to the airport.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.057
I thought I could get back
before he woke up.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.225
Is he okay?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.160
He's fine.
He's in his room.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.795
I'll go talk to him.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.731
I'm so sorry
you came out for nothing.

11:03.731 --> 11:07.134
Well, we need to talk to your
wife to, uh, verify she's okay.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.368
It's protocol.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.870
You understand, right?
Right.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.539
Um, I'll get you
her aunt's number.

11:12.539 --> 11:13.974
I know I have it somewhere.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.575
Here.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.745
Just give us her full name
and approximate age,

11:17.745 --> 11:18.912
and we'll find it.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.247
Of course.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.749
Should I take Cosmo
to school?

11:21.749 --> 11:24.317
You know what? He's missed
half the day already.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.886
Can you stay
and look after him?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.587
No problem. Great.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.758
Again, I'm so sorry
we wasted your time.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.593
I'll see you later.

11:33.593 --> 11:34.762
You buying that?

11:34.762 --> 11:36.029
Not a word.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.031
We should loop in
the detectives.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.900
Hey. I'm taking a poll.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.102
How old were you when you did
your first load of laundry?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.037
Ooh. No idea.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.273
I was living at home, though,
so...14?

11:46.273 --> 11:49.442
Okay, Aaron's answer was never.
He was never years old.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.543
What?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.945
<i>He doesn't know how.</i>

11:51.945 --> 11:54.447
I don't know
why I should be so shocked.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.615
What about you?

11:55.615 --> 11:57.751
6. I learned early
my mom wasn't gonna do it.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.119
Also not shocking.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.453
Alright, well,
I got to go, babe.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.789
I'll see you later at lunch.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.223
Yeah, wouldn't miss it.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.626
It is a good thing
you wore a helmet.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.727
I think you're gonna be fine.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.763
Aah!

12:49.636 --> 12:52.505
Hey. You hurt?

12:52.505 --> 12:55.308
I'm fine. My partner
just went into surgery.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.776
Who shoots at an ambulance?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.679
I don't know.
I saw a red sedan speeding off.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.614
I wish I could be more helpful.
I'm sorry.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.650
I mean, don't apologize.
You jumped in front

13:03.650 --> 13:05.285
and hit the brakes.
That's badass.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.586
Badass or bad luck?

13:06.586 --> 13:08.856
This is the second partner
I've sent into the hospital.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.357
Well, if you really think
you have bad luck,

13:10.357 --> 13:12.993
I know a great <i>curandera.</i>
She'll cleanse it right out.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.261
I might take you up on that.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.795
Just got word
from the hospital.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.998
Your partner and the patient
are gonna be okay.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.499
Oh, good. Thank you.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.667
They'll have
police escorts

13:20.667 --> 13:22.335
until we figure out
who the target was.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.770
Think they were shooting
at the patient?

13:23.770 --> 13:26.639
It could have just been
a random drive-by. I don't know.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.975
Well, we've got
officers canvassing,

13:27.975 --> 13:29.642
looking for
security footage.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.111
We'll know more soon.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.546
So, when you get done here,
check in with Sergeant Hadley.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.882
She'll be
coordinating the grid.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.616
On it.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.551
I don't suppose you'll be
taking the rest of the day off?

13:38.551 --> 13:39.652
Because I got shot at?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.554
Silly question.
Sorry I asked.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.722
You'll call me
if you need anything?

13:42.722 --> 13:44.091
Thank you. I will.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.465
What's so important you can't
even let me get to my office?

13:52.465 --> 13:54.467
We think Judge Rivas
is on the take.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.802
That's a big accusation.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.138
I know. But I also know him.
I know how his mind works.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.472
And his rulings
have been inconsistent

13:59.472 --> 14:02.342
over the past three months.
And it's not random.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.744
They're all tied and connected
to Monica and her firm.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.914
He overwhelmingly
rules in her favor.

14:06.914 --> 14:10.150
So you think she's bribing the
judge to protect Elijah's guys?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.851
With Elijah
writing the checks,

14:11.851 --> 14:14.587
she's under tremendous pressure
to bring results.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.157
I wouldn't put it past her
to bribe a judge.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.659
I'll try to get a warrant
to search his financial records.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.095
Be careful.
Judges look after each other.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.596
You have to approach
someone you trust.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.265
Judge Zuckerman and I
go way back.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.599
She will not warn Rivas.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.601
But will she openly
go against another judge?

14:28.601 --> 14:29.937
There's only one way
to find out.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.272
If Rivas is corrupt,

14:32.272 --> 14:35.909
it calls all his cases
into question.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.178
Even the ones
he didn't throw.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.513
No telling how many criminals
could go free.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.182
I know.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.117
Keep me posted.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.686
How much do you spend on food?

14:46.686 --> 14:48.956
I'm not sure,
but I think I still have

14:48.956 --> 14:50.857
all my takeout receipts.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.526
Okay.
How much do you order in?

14:53.526 --> 14:55.428
You know, I feel like
there's a right answer,

14:55.428 --> 14:57.064
but I don't have an idea
what it is.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.266
Cooking is a lot more
cost-effective, but--

14:59.266 --> 15:00.433
You do know
how to cook, right?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.235
Oh, yeah.
I make the perfect martini.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.736
You were right
about Sonia Laetner.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.205
She wasn't on
any flight manifest,

15:05.205 --> 15:07.374
and none of her family in Ohio
has heard from her.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.608
What about her cellphone?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.443
It last pinged near their house,
then went dead.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.612
We're gonna find her body
in Griffith Park, aren't we?

15:12.612 --> 15:15.482
Bring her husband in.
I want to talk to him. Okay.

Have a unicorn.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.964
Too kind. Thank you.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.236
They're testing you,
seeing how far you'll bend.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.404
Yeah, I saw
the same kind of thing

16:44.404 --> 16:45.972
when I was
in the military.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.975
Not about how many stripes
on your sleeves with this crew.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.977
It's all good.
Team building.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.814
If you're gonna lead this team,
they need to know who you are.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.984
Show them the Tim Bradford
that was tapped to join Metro

16:57.984 --> 16:59.686
in the first place.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.290
Thanks.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.860
Mr. Laetner,
if your wife, Sonia, is in Ohio,

17:07.860 --> 17:11.164
do you have any idea why
her car was parked in Hollywood

17:11.164 --> 17:14.201
with her phone and purse
still inside?

17:14.201 --> 17:16.103
I don't know.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.770
See, in my line of work,

17:17.770 --> 17:20.607
when a woman takes a last-minute
trip with no money,

17:20.607 --> 17:23.210
9 times out of 10, her husband's
got something to do with it.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.344
So where's Sonia?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.213
I don't know.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.215
I swear.
That's the truth.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.449
Look, you're right.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.618
I-I did lie
to your officers earlier.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.521
But he said if I involved
the police, he'd kill Sonia.

17:34.521 --> 17:38.291
Who said that?
The man who took her.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.593
Look, Sonia never
came home last night.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.196
I was about to call the police
when my phone rang,

17:43.196 --> 17:45.265
and they said if I ever wanted
to see her again,

17:45.265 --> 17:47.267
I'd have to pay him
$250,000.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.301
I need the number.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.770
It said "blocked."

17:50.770 --> 17:53.473
Listen. I know
I-I shouldn't have lied,

17:53.473 --> 17:55.542
but I'd really prefer
to handle this myself.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.710
Unfortunately, that's no longer
an option, Mr. Laetner.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.112
And you owe it to your wife

17:59.112 --> 18:01.581
to use every resource available
to bring her home safely.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.082
What do you think
I've been trying to do?!

18:07.354 --> 18:09.088
You're right.
I-I'm-- I'm sorry.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.292
It's alright.
It's a stressful situation.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.827
Now, what can you tell me
about the man's voice?

18:14.827 --> 18:18.465
To the left.
To the right.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.799
To the left.
Oh! Watch out!

18:19.799 --> 18:21.768
Mm.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.737
I thought you were gonna
get first place.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.873
You don't want
to play again?

18:29.976 --> 18:31.611
You know,
I don't like to brag,

18:31.611 --> 18:34.947
but I'm, like, really good
friends with the cops here.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.251
They're doing
everything they can

18:38.251 --> 18:40.920
to make sure
your mom comes home to you.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.491
And until she does,
you can call me.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.159
Whenever you want.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.195
Even if it's just to talk.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.596
Got it?

18:51.731 --> 18:53.800
Cosmo, let's go.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.640
He did not look happy.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.342
He's not.
What happened?

19:02.342 --> 19:03.943
Claims Sonia was kidnapped
for a ransom

19:03.943 --> 19:05.378
but doesn't want
the cops involved.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.614
Do we buy that?
He's already lied to us once.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.049
I'm not taking anything
at face value.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.618
You spend a lot of time
at the house.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.719
Do you think he'd hurt her?

19:12.719 --> 19:15.121
No. He's--
He's never been violent.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.790
I've heard them argue
maybe like twice.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.826
Why?
Do you think he killed her?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.297
I'm not ruling anything out.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.732
We need a team
to search the house.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.400
Once they're done,
I want units parked outside.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.735
If he leaves
for any reason,

19:28.735 --> 19:30.303
I want him followed.
You got it.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.572
I'm gonna get a warrant for
his phone. For whatever reason,

19:32.572 --> 19:34.807
he cannot be allowed
to make a money drop alone--

19:34.807 --> 19:36.843
if there even is
a money drop.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.012
Alright. Come on.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.758
Detectives just
got a partial plate

19:51.758 --> 19:53.993
<i>from the surveillance footage
near the ambulance shooting.</i>

19:53.993 --> 19:57.597
Shooter left driving
a 1992 red Sentra.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.731
What do you got here?

19:58.731 --> 20:00.733
New car fire.
No obvious sign of arson,

20:00.733 --> 20:02.335
but that's for the investigators
to decide.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.170
Let's call in an 11-85

20:04.170 --> 20:06.273
for impound to our location.
Copy that.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.940
So any news on that shooting
from this morning?

20:07.940 --> 20:09.442
It's got all my guys
a little on edge.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.611
Yeah. We got a lot of good
detectives working on that.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.179
We'll let you know
as soon as we learn something.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.081
Appreciate it.
Tow truck's 30 minutes out.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.283
Right.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.784
Get down. Get down.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.588
Pull him up.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.523
We got you. We got help coming.
Call it in.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.091
Control, shots fired
at our location.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.093
We have a firefighter down.
He is conscious and breathing.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.628
Send an R.A. and backup.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.100
Control,
also send an airship.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.504
Suspect fleeing location,
red sedan, east on Olympic.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.745
Captain Burke:
<i>We answer more than
1,000 calls a day.</i>

20:45.745 --> 20:46.946
<i>My people can't do their jobs</i>

20:46.946 --> 20:48.114
<i>with a bullseye
on their backs.</i>

20:48.114 --> 20:49.982
Effective immediately,
the LAPD will dispatch units

20:49.982 --> 20:52.619
to accompany
your firefighters on calls.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.121
<i>We had cops at the
burned-out car. Didn't help.</i>

20:55.121 --> 20:57.256
<i>You need to
catch this guy now!</i>

20:57.256 --> 20:59.792
Yeah.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.763
You wanted to see me, sir?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.932
Yes.
Your mother called.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.067
Sir?
As in me.

21:08.067 --> 21:11.304
As in asking why
her son is dodging her calls.

21:11.304 --> 21:14.073
She even called Dispatch.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.108
I am so sorry.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.244
Save your apologies.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.680
I don't want to hear
from your crazy mother again.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.749
I'll get-- If you--
I'll--

21:22.749 --> 21:23.950
Go.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.690
You okay?

21:30.690 --> 21:32.525
I'll be better
once there's not some psycho

21:32.525 --> 21:34.461
gunning for every fire crew
in the city.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.862
We'll find him.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.797
It's only a matter of time.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.666
Yeah.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.934
Mom?
Well, it's from
a different number.

21:41.934 --> 21:43.803
Hello.
Dr. Schnitzel:
<i>Hello. I'm Dr. Schnitzel.</i>

21:43.803 --> 21:45.037
<i>Your mother was just admitted,</i>

21:45.037 --> 21:47.039
<i>and we need to verify
her insurance.</i>

21:47.039 --> 21:48.475
Really? Dr. Schnitzel?

21:48.475 --> 21:50.477
You-- You-- You really think
I'm gonna buy that?

21:50.477 --> 21:52.845
<i>I don't--</i>
Look. You tell my mom

21:52.845 --> 21:54.347
it's not happening.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.015
Alright?
A-And word of advice--

21:56.015 --> 21:58.485
Don't let her pull you
into any of her schemes.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.353
What was that?
Ah, vintage Mom.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.188
She's moved on to number 5
in her playbook--

22:02.188 --> 22:03.556
pretend to be sick
for sympathy,

22:03.556 --> 22:06.158
get me to give my credit card
number to an accomplice.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.796
Cosmo would love this.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.298
I've never seen a kid
who was such a health nut.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.969
You've been putting in
a lot of hours at their house.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.237
Not that many.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.640
And you're working
the night shift somewhere.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.810
This morning, you were
<i>not</i> coming home from a party.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.746
Not dressed like that.
You were coming home from a job.

22:26.746 --> 22:27.980
What's going on with you?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.148
You need money

Why would you say that?
Of course you can.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.397
How's that gonna work?

22:44.397 --> 22:46.198
You, me, and Tim?

22:46.198 --> 22:49.368
And that's assuming you wouldn't
want to get your own place.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.604
Either way,
there's no room for me.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.775
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.276
Ready for the movie?
I found out

22:57.276 --> 22:59.378
that "Time After Time"
is on a streaming platform.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.616
I think I'm gonna crash.

Yeah, sure.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.699
Any chance your judge signed off
on the warrant?

23:19.699 --> 23:22.769
Uh, short answer, no.
"Insufficient probable cause."

23:22.769 --> 23:24.303
No judge wants to imply

23:24.303 --> 23:26.305
that a fellow member of the
bench is guilty of malfeasance.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.940
Well, no warrant,
no evidence.

Maybe he'll open up.

Reminiscing.
You know, a lot's changed.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.508
We split up.
You got all sanctimonious.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.809
You sold your soul
to the devil.

24:06.846 --> 24:07.947

24:28.968 --> 24:30.336
I'll be brief.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.539
I know you're
throwing cases.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.507
I beg your pardon?

24:34.507 --> 24:36.809
I don't have any evidence.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.678
Monica's too smart for that.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.813

You didn't know, did you?

24:45.685 --> 24:47.353
He is her biggest client.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.355
Every time she asks you
to rule in her favor,

it's for one of his guys.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.292
You're helping
rebuild his empire.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.562
I'm helping? The whole reason
he's back on the streets

24:55.562 --> 24:57.496
is because of you!
I know!

24:57.496 --> 24:59.465
I am well aware
of my part in all this.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.668
Which is why I know that
you haven't slept in months,

25:01.668 --> 25:02.969
you can't concentrate,

25:02.969 --> 25:04.336
and sometimes your heart
races so fast,

25:04.336 --> 25:05.672
you think you're having
a heart attack.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.474
A life lived
in the service of justice.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.409
I always wanted that
to be my legacy.

25:10.409 --> 25:12.912
It still can be.

Help me put Elijah

25:14.681 --> 25:17.016
He goes after
anyone who crosses him.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.686
I'm sure you could cut a deal
for witness protection.

25:21.287 --> 25:24.490
And I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.225
Please leave.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.730
You know how to reach me
if you change your mind.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.282
Hey.
Any updates on Cosmo's mom?

25:50.282 --> 25:52.852
Uh, no. We had units
parked outside all night.

25:52.852 --> 25:53.953
There was no movement.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.122
But, you know, they have
his phones tapped,

25:56.122 --> 25:58.124
so if the kidnappers call,
we'll know.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.426
Do you think
she's still alive?

26:00.426 --> 26:02.795
Listen.
If it's about money,

26:02.795 --> 26:04.731
they have every incentive
to keep her alive

26:04.731 --> 26:05.798
until they get
what they want.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.238
Cosmo?
<i>Dad says
I'm not going to school,</i>

26:12.238 --> 26:14.040
<i>and he won't
come out of his office.</i>

26:14.040 --> 26:15.307
<i>Can you come over?</i>

26:15.307 --> 26:17.309
I'll be right there.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.578
Hey. I don't think
that's a good idea.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.481
I have to.

26:22.481 --> 26:26.085
Tamara? Um, I'll be
parked outside, okay?

26:28.454 --> 26:29.956
You got here early.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.625
I did.
I had a thought this morning.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.762
Our shooter is specifically
targeting firefighters.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.129
You don't just
get up one morning

26:37.129 --> 26:40.066
and decide to start
shooting at LAFD.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.600
This is what
it escalated to.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.269
Okay, so you thought
it may have started somewhere.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.804
Exactly. So I started
looking into

26:44.804 --> 26:46.673
any case that involves
the fire department--

26:46.673 --> 26:48.741
complaints, lawsuits,
patrol calls--

26:48.741 --> 26:49.809
anything and everything.

26:49.809 --> 26:50.977
I can help.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.478
No need.

26:52.478 --> 26:54.146
I got him.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.783
His name is Anthony Pickett.
He's a firefighter--

26:56.783 --> 26:59.085
ex-firefighter,
to be specific.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.486
Got cut
and didn't take it well?

27:00.486 --> 27:01.788
Yeah, he made it
through the academy

27:01.788 --> 27:03.289
but washed out
during probation.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.758
Other firefighters found him
to be difficult and aggressive.

27:05.758 --> 27:08.961
He actually picked a fight with
an old-timer who later found

27:08.961 --> 27:11.363
the hose had been cut
on his breathing apparatus.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.800
Mm. Short fuse.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.302
Few days after that, he showed
up at the station that cut him

27:16.302 --> 27:18.137
looking to get his job back.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.640
Unit was called out, but
he seemed to accept his fate.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.275
But apparently,
he couldn't let it go.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.543
Okay,
how do we know it's him?

27:24.543 --> 27:26.112
Cross-referenced
his registered vehicle

27:26.112 --> 27:28.280
with our description
and partial plate.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.882
It's a match.
I already put out a BOLO.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.450
I'll send units
to sit on the house.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.952
Maybe we'll get lucky.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.954
Good work.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.956
Thank you.
I know I volunteered us

27:36.956 --> 27:38.691
for the most boring
detail ever.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.292
Of course.
You're worried about Tamara.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.460
I get it. Yeah.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.062
Plus, it gives me time
to apartment-hunt.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.363
Mm.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.132
It's hard to find a place
with a pool.

27:47.633 --> 27:48.968
Yeah. I mean,
you might need

27:48.968 --> 27:50.870
to be a little flexible
with that one.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.873
Well, I used your "rent should
be 30% of your salary" rule...

27:53.873 --> 27:56.542
Oh.
...and-- and there's like
nothing in my price range.

27:56.542 --> 27:57.710
Well...

27:57.710 --> 27:59.812
hold on.
That place is cute.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.647
Yeah.
This place is trash.

28:01.647 --> 28:04.183
Uh, that place
looks like my apartment.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.429
I'm gonna go
check on your dad.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.367
No. You listen to me.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.336

I swear--

28:24.336 --> 28:25.872
That's not possible.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.941
You're not giving me
enough time. I need more time.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.277
I can't!

28:31.277 --> 28:34.613
No. She's got
nothing to do with this.

28:34.613 --> 28:35.782
And how do I know that?

28:35.782 --> 28:37.683
Please...

28:37.683 --> 28:39.451
let me talk to her.
Put her on.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.355
Hey.
I think Deon's on the phone

28:43.355 --> 28:44.791
with the kidnappers now.
I don't have your money!

28:44.791 --> 28:45.958
I can hear him shouting.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.927
What's he saying?
<i>I can't make it out.</i>

28:47.927 --> 28:49.128
He's emotional.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.462
I'm sorry. Please put her on.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.931
It has to be them. Please.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.532
Tamara, the detectives
are listening

28:53.532 --> 28:55.935
to all of his known phones,
okay? He's under surveillance.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.937
Just let the investigators
do their job.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.639
All you got to do is make sure
that kid is safe. That's it.

29:00.639 --> 29:02.308

29:02.308 --> 29:03.542
What if he's on a burner?

29:03.542 --> 29:04.743
Tamara...

29:04.743 --> 29:07.579
No. She's got
nothing to do with this!

29:07.579 --> 29:10.282
How do I know that? Huh?

29:10.282 --> 29:13.719
Please... let me talk to her.
Put her on.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.455

talk to her. Put her on."

29:19.125 --> 29:21.260
<i>"I don't have your money.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.997

"I didn't think you'd miss it."

29:24.997 --> 29:26.465

"I'm sorry."

29:26.465 --> 29:27.599
Please. Don't hurt her.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.802
"Please don't hurt her."

Uh, Tamara, don't let him know
that you heard him, okay?

29:33.605 --> 29:36.642
Just get as far away as you can.
We're heading in right now.

29:36.642 --> 29:39.578
That bastard.
This happened because of him.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.316
He hung up.
I got to go.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.355
What are you doing?
Listening in?

29:49.355 --> 29:51.323
Yeah.
I heard everything.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.791
You did this for money?

29:52.791 --> 29:53.826
You don't understand.

29:53.826 --> 29:56.295
You're right.
I don't understand.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.997
Police are on their way.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.366
Let them help you.
No. These guys will kill her!

30:01.367 --> 30:02.601
Police!

30:03.635 --> 30:05.537
Mr. Laetner, you need
to come with us.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.379
Time to come clean. Which one of
your clients did you steal from?

30:13.379 --> 30:14.780
Are you sure Cosmo's okay?

30:14.780 --> 30:16.448
Tamara is with him.
He's fine.

30:16.448 --> 30:17.549
You need to focus.

30:17.549 --> 30:18.851
We know you were
skimming money,

30:18.851 --> 30:20.819
and we know someone took
your wife in retaliation.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.688
Who was it?

30:22.688 --> 30:24.123
Reed Butler.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.292
That wasn't very smart.
He's killed for a lot less.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.560
I know.
But I figured he's a criminal.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.829
I'm stealing back
the money he stole.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.498
It's justice, kind of.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.699
How noble of you.

30:33.699 --> 30:36.635
Look, I know I'm not innocent
in all this,

30:36.635 --> 30:38.637
but my wife is.

30:38.637 --> 30:39.972
Please help.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.740
I need you to call
the people who have your wife

30:41.740 --> 30:43.009
and tell them
you've got the money.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.376
Set up a place
for the exchange.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.512
He knows I don't have the money.
He'll know I'm lying.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.014
Tell them a family member
came through,

30:48.014 --> 30:49.515
wired it to you
this morning.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.717
Okay. A-And then?

30:51.717 --> 30:53.185
Then you're gonna
write down a confession

30:53.185 --> 30:55.787
detailing how you embezzled
money from a client.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.525
I'm going to jail,
aren't I?

30:59.525 --> 31:02.561
Probably.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.330
I'm such an idiot.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.498
No argument
from this side of the table.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.267
Rivas texted
early this morning.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.768
Was it a full
admission of guilt?

31:09.768 --> 31:11.938
"Can we talk?" He's been careful
not to admit anything,

31:11.938 --> 31:13.172
but I can tell he wants to.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.709

31:29.355 --> 31:32.058
He's cold.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.393
It looks like there's
no injury, no blood.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.962
It looks like
maybe a heart attack.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.396
Elijah did this.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.298
We don't know that for sure.
At his age--

31:39.298 --> 31:40.599
But Monica
saw me last night.

31:40.599 --> 31:44.470
She knew I could
get through to him.

one with
as little morality as him.

40:43.675 --> 40:44.976
What I can't decide

40:44.976 --> 40:47.278
is if the woman that I
fell in love with in law school,

40:47.278 --> 40:49.781
who was kind and loving,

40:49.781 --> 40:52.984
is just gone
or if she never really existed.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.823
Were you always just a sociopath
putting on an act?

41:01.527 --> 41:03.495
He'll kill you, too,
you know.

41:03.495 --> 41:04.963
Eventually.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.932
♪ Better days are coming fast

41:06.932 --> 41:08.867
Another text.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.637
You are a hero
to firefighters everywhere.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.104
So they admit

41:13.104 --> 41:15.774
that police officers
aren't entirely useless.

41:15.774 --> 41:18.710
Today.
Tomorrow, the rivalry resumes.

41:18.710 --> 41:19.845
I'll take it.

41:23.448 --> 41:24.616
Is that your mom again?

41:24.616 --> 41:26.284
Foxburg Memorial Hospital.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.886
Hello?

41:27.886 --> 41:29.721
Yes, this is he.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.825
I don't understand.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.030
Oh.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.732
Alright, thank you.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.636
What?

41:46.071 --> 41:48.206
My mom died.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.718
