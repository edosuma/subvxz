00:05.760 --> 00:07.240
You're supposed to be in charge, Perkins.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.400
- l am in charge.
- These men want answers.

00:09.480 --> 00:13.040
What's your plan? This thing could kill us all.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.880
We should've been gone two days ago.
No one would listen to me.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.920
Nobody knew what it was then.
Nobody knows now.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.880
- Somebody has to go for help.
- What about the rest of us? What do we do?

00:22.960 --> 00:26.720
- Just wait here till help arrives?
- One of us has to hike out!

00:26.800 --> 00:30.800
That person might not make it
down to the road before nightfall!

00:30.880 --> 00:33.440
Then what? l say we make a run for it.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.400
- Split up. Take our chances.
- lt's suicide, Dyer.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.840
Fine.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.240
You stay here, tell us how it turns out.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.880
You're going the wrong way!

01:34.280 --> 01:37.400
- l think it's broken.
- Come on, you gotta get up!

01:37.480 --> 01:39.880
l don't think l can make it.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.120
We gotta keep moving!

01:47.520 --> 01:49.520
We're not gonna make it!

02:50.920 --> 02:54.080
- Take a good look, Scully.
- What am l looking at?

02:54.160 --> 02:58.400
30 loggers working a clear-cutting
contract in Washington State.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.360
Rugged, manly men
in the full bloom of manhood.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.360
But what am l looking for?

03:03.440 --> 03:07.120
Anything strange, unexplainable,
unlikely... boyfriend?

03:07.200 --> 03:09.880
l don't know. l give up, Mulder.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.920
You give up? That's what
the Federal Forest Service has done.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.840
- What happened to them?
- They vanished.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.920
Or so it would appear.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.880
This is Doug Spinney and Steven Teague.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.960
They're monkey-wrenchers, the guys
who sabotage logging equipment

03:27.040 --> 03:29.840
and make life miserable for lumberjacks.

03:29.920 --> 03:34.160
Eco-terrorists
or militant environmentalists.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.240
Two weeks ago,
the loggers radioed a message

03:37.320 --> 03:40.080
that Spinney and Teague
had gone on a spree,

03:40.160 --> 03:43.320
sabotaging equipment,
causing general mischief.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.480
One week later,
radio communication was cut off.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.720
- Do they know why?
- No.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.880
The lumber company asked
the Federal Forest Service to look into it.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.200
Two officials were sent in.
No one's heard from them.

03:56.280 --> 03:59.760
The monkey-wrenchers are doing
more than mischief-making.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.720
That's what the Federal Forest Service think.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.440
They've asked the FBl to investigate.
l had to pull strings to get the case.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.520
For an eco-terrorism case?
Do l dare ask why?

04:10.600 --> 04:13.040
ln 1934, long before anyone knew

04:13.120 --> 04:15.880
what an eco-terrorist was, a WPA crew

04:15.960 --> 04:18.880
working that area vanished without a trace.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.160
Not one of those men was ever found
or heard from again.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.560
And you suspect - what? - Bigfoot?

04:24.640 --> 04:28.800
Not likely. That's a lot of flannel
to choke down even for Bigfoot!

04:30.480 --> 04:34.600
Come on, Scully,
it'll be a nice trip to the forest.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.400
Hi.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.040
Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.
We're with the FBl.

05:04.520 --> 05:09.000
Larry Moore, Federal Forest Service.
You can put your gear in the back.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.640
Must be pretty rugged where we're going.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.120
Yeah.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.480
ls that a bullet hole in your windshield?

05:15.560 --> 05:18.560
- .22 calibre.
- Somebody take a shot at you?

05:18.640 --> 05:21.080
That's what it would appear.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.880
- Not much to hunt here, except Freddies.
- Freddies?

05:23.960 --> 05:27.800
The Federal Forest Service.
lt's what eco-terrorists call us.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.320
ls that who you think took a shot at you?

05:30.400 --> 05:32.360
Let me get this outta the way.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.680
l have no quarrel with eco-terrorists
in principle.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.840
l'm as concerned for this forest
and the environment as anybody.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.040
lt's their methods l can't condone.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.480
Would they go so far as to kill a man?

05:44.560 --> 05:49.120
There's 30 men up there unaccounted for,
each with survival experience.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.200
Something happened to 'em.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.400
Sorry l'm late.
l was talking to Bob Perkins' wife.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.480
He's one of our missing loggers.
Hello, Larry.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.400
Steve Humphreys, head of security
for Schiff-lmmergut Lumber.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.560
Mulder, Scully.

06:04.640 --> 06:08.800
We've got a four-hour drive.
Plenty of time to get to know each other.

06:09.800 --> 06:14.120
Get the impression we've walked into
the middle of a war that's already started?

06:23.880 --> 06:26.560
Why do these men work
so far up in the wilderness?

06:26.640 --> 06:29.040
- That's where the trees are.
- You're kidding, right?

06:29.120 --> 06:33.120
No, environmentalists have made sure
the land is untouchable.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.440
Force us to take timber where we can.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.080
We plant saplings for every tree we take.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.480
So why do the eco-terrorists target you?

06:40.560 --> 06:43.520
These tree-huggers are the same kinda boys

06:43.600 --> 06:47.920
who went up to Canada during
the Vietnam war. They're cowardly.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.280
Dammit!

06:50.360 --> 06:54.560
Homemade tyre spike -
clear through the sidewall. lt's unfixable.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.000
- You got a spare, don't you?
- Right tyre's history, too.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.080
The monkey-wrenchers call it a caltrop.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.360
The roads are littered with them.

07:03.440 --> 07:08.880
lndiscriminate. lmagine somebody
spiking Washington DC's roads.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.520
Like to see how much sympathy
they'd get then!

07:10.600 --> 07:12.840
So how are we gonna get up to the camp?

07:12.920 --> 07:14.920
We're gonna have to hike.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.120
Anybody here?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.320
Someone forgot to clean their plate.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.440
lt looks like they left in a hurry, too.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.600
They forgot to pack.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.280
- Find anything?
- Party favours.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.000
Vehicles have been monkey-wrenched.
Generator's busted.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.360
Somebody turned this place upside down.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.080
And they didn't want the fact broadcast.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.320
The radiators are all full of rice.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.280
Sugar or sand in all the crankcases.
They really did a number here.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.920
The sun's going down in an hour and a half.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Better look around before dark.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.880
l'll see if l can get that generator working.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.760
- You were right about one thing.
- What's that?

09:14.840 --> 09:16.840
lt definitely wasn't Bigfoot.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.040
Look at that!

09:39.040 --> 09:41.040
What is it?

09:43.040 --> 09:44.920
lt looks like a hive.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.240
- Maybe a cocoon of some kind.
- Made by what?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.520
l don't know. l've never seen anything like it.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.440
Got it.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.320
- Can you cut it down?
- Yeah, l think so.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.120
You all right, Scully?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.080
Oh, God!

10:52.560 --> 10:56.120
lt feels... it feels desiccated, hard and dry,

10:56.200 --> 10:58.040
almost preserved.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.360
Like it's been embalmed.

11:00.440 --> 11:04.560
No, more like all the fluids
have been bled from its body.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.840
Almost like it's been cured.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.680
l think...

11:08.760 --> 11:10.680
it's a male.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.200
Barely.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.360
l'd say it's some kind of spider's nest

11:15.440 --> 11:17.560
or insect cocoon.

11:17.640 --> 11:22.280
What kind of insect could have gotten
a man all the way up into that tree?

11:22.360 --> 11:24.760
ltsy-bitsy spider.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.760
Don't move!

12:24.640 --> 12:25.640
Who are you?

12:29.840 --> 12:32.360
Doug Spinney.
l ought to shoot you where you stand.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.240
Might as well shoot yourself.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.240
You're in a helluva spot to test me.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.000
- What happened to my men?
- What men?

12:39.080 --> 12:41.320
The men who were working this camp.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.800
l don't know. The same thing that'll
happen to us when the sun goes down.

12:46.880 --> 12:50.040
- What are you doing?
- This animal's Doug Spinney.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.720
He's responsible for the monkey-wrenching.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.160
- Probably a murderer.
- l'm no murderer.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.760
- Liar!
- Let's hear what he has to say.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.400
lf we stand around here talking,
there'll be nothing left to say.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.600
l'd get that generator started.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.440
Darkness is our enemy.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.480
What's he talking about?

13:07.560 --> 13:09.760
Someone wanna give me a hand?

13:09.840 --> 13:12.120
He's giving orders? l fixed the damn thing!

13:12.200 --> 13:14.200
Hey, it's all right.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.320
Why did you say
the darkness was our enemy?

13:26.440 --> 13:28.400
That's when they come.

13:28.480 --> 13:32.440
- When who comes?
- l don't know what it is.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.480
They come from the sky.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.520
They take a man off his feet
and devour him alive.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.480
- l saw it happen.
- Happen to who?

13:44.120 --> 13:47.120
l need to eat. l haven't eaten in three days.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.200
What kinda BS story is that, huh?
You believe that?

13:55.400 --> 13:58.160
- We found something in the forest.
- What?

13:59.080 --> 14:01.400
A man caught in some kind of insect cocoon.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.040
- What happened here?
- We're camped two valleys over.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.720
- Four of us, three now.
- More rats in the woodpile.

14:16.640 --> 14:17.960
Our truck has a dead battery,

14:18.040 --> 14:20.880
so we drew straws to see who'd hike here
to steal one from the loggers.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.240
- Why notjust hike out?
- lt's more than a day's hike.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.800
No way we'd want to be caught out after dark.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.040
Not after what happened to Teague.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.360
The man you said was devoured alive?

14:31.440 --> 14:32.800
Yeah.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.440
- What are you guys doing out here?
- Camping.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.240
The kind of camping you do
is a federal offence.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.440
- Hold off a second.
- He's right.

14:42.760 --> 14:46.000
This man's a felon.
He could be placed under arrest.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.040
What about your offence, my friend?

14:49.120 --> 14:51.080
The offence against nature!

14:51.160 --> 14:55.440
We operate within the law.
We pay for the right to take those trees.

14:55.520 --> 15:00.440
Oh, yeah? Your logging crew is taking trees
that nobody has a right to.

15:00.520 --> 15:04.920
Trees that are marked! So don't talk
to me about breaking the law, sir!

15:05.000 --> 15:08.120
- They've been taking marked trees?
- Yes, sir. Marked in orange.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.560
Old-growth trees?
Know anything about that, Steve?

15:12.760 --> 15:14.560
No.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.320
Gonna take this man's word over mine?

15:22.600 --> 15:26.840
You don't wanna go out in the night.
Take my word on that.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.760
lt's out there.

15:29.840 --> 15:34.840
lf l go out, somebody will attack me,
eat me alive and spin me in its web?

15:34.920 --> 15:36.800
Yes.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.240
lt's too polite to come in here and get me?

15:40.320 --> 15:43.080
For some reason, it's afraid of the light.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.560
- lt's afraid of the light!
- There may be something to it.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.240
He's a murderer and just clever enough
to make up that story.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.200
Even to whip up that cocoon
to save a few trees.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.720
And l'm gonna prove l'm right.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.160
This is ridiculous!

16:08.040 --> 16:10.000
Where is it, Spinney?

16:10.080 --> 16:12.960
l thought it was gonna come

16:13.040 --> 16:15.440
and devour me!

16:16.360 --> 16:17.680
Hey, here l am!

16:20.640 --> 16:22.920
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

16:25.200 --> 16:27.160
Don't be shy.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.240
Come on!

16:31.480 --> 16:35.920
lt's just like l told you.
There's nothing out here but a bunch of trees.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.720
Trees this man values more than human life.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.480
l'm gonna see him tried on murder charges.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.000
What do you think?

16:47.080 --> 16:50.760
l think l'm gonna suggest
that we sleep with the lights on.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.880
See this Douglas fir?

17:15.960 --> 17:19.400
lt's been here since before time
and your men cut it down.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.119
- Who marks these trees?
- Federal Forest Service.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.520
You're only supposed to cut trees
marked with a blue X.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.960
This tree must be hundreds of years old.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.600
You must get a lot of lumber from a big tree.

17:30.680 --> 17:35.000
Thousands of board feet.
Helluva lot easier than taking smaller trees.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.880
Monkey-wrenchers like Spinney
are not above marking trees.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.600
This tree's 500 years old if it's a day, Steve.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.480
Look at this.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.640
What would this represent?

17:49.200 --> 17:52.640
l don't know.
l've never seen a ring like that before.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.120
Those centre rings are the older rings?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.840
Every ring represents a season of growth.

17:57.920 --> 18:01.440
You see these? These are 500, 600 years old.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.840
They're a recorded history
of rainfall and climate.

18:04.920 --> 18:08.720
But this one l don't know.
l should take a core sample.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.920
We finished this nature walk?
l wanna know what happened to the loggers.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.560
- We're determining that, sir.
- Looking at a tree stump?

18:16.640 --> 18:19.640
- lnterrogate this man.
- l don't think he did it.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.360
- l want him arrested.
- He's not going anywhere.

18:22.440 --> 18:26.480
Not with a gun on him.
What happens if his three buddies show up

18:26.560 --> 18:28.520
and do to you what they did

18:28.600 --> 18:31.000
to those Federal Forest officials?

18:31.080 --> 18:33.280
l just wanna take a core sample.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.880
l got families who want answers
about loved ones and so do you!

18:36.960 --> 18:39.200
Answers that won't be found in that tree!

18:39.280 --> 18:41.840
The only crime is the death of that tree.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.040
We'll see about that.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.120
- Where are you going?
- Down to your truck.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.960
l'll get on the horn and get people
up here who'll take some action.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.000
- Steve!
- Let him go.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.240
Let him find out for himself.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.360
This is odd.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.840
This yellow ring's got something living in it.
Some kind of...

19:10.000 --> 19:11.640
tiny bug.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.640
lt doesn't make sense.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.160
Why not?

19:15.240 --> 19:18.520
Well, parasites attack a tree
in a variety of ways,

19:18.600 --> 19:21.320
but they always attack the living parts.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.200
The leaves, the roots, the new growth rings.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.240
Even if they're borers of some kind,

19:27.320 --> 19:29.280
they wouldn't work so deep.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.640
They seem to be feeding on this ring's wood.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.640
Can you identify them?

19:33.720 --> 19:36.840
lt's a wood mite of some kind.
Nothing l've ever seen.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.960
Can they have been there centuries?

19:39.040 --> 19:43.120
l don't see how.
These inner rings are essentially dead wood.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.240
The tree's vascular system
is limited to the outer few rings.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.280
They need water to survive.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.080
They appear to be hatching
out of the porous wood.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.360
Maybe when you drilled this core,
you tapped into a larger nest.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.040
Can they build a cocoon?

20:00.480 --> 20:03.680
Right after that tree was cut down
was when Teague died.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.240
lt's about the same time
when the loggers disappeared.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.160
You think these mites killed them?

20:09.240 --> 20:13.560
Maybe they were dormant for hundreds
of years. Maybe they woke up hungry.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.800
Dammit!

21:27.320 --> 21:29.880
All right, you monkey-wrenchers,
come on out!

21:34.560 --> 21:36.840
l know what you're up to!

23:16.160 --> 23:18.720
Humphreys should've been back by now.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.960
These bugs aren't moving any more.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.600
They're either dead or they're asleep.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.720
They don't like the light.

23:25.800 --> 23:29.680
That's weird.
Usually bugs are attracted to light.

23:29.760 --> 23:33.080
These obviously are not your ordinary bugs.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.200
To say the least.

23:35.280 --> 23:40.680
- What do you know about insects?
- Just what l learned in biology courses.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.720
That they're the foundation
of our ecosystem,

23:43.800 --> 23:45.760
that there are lots of them:

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
200 million per person on Earth.

23:47.920 --> 23:51.880
- And they've been around a long time, right?
- About 600 million years.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.960
Even before the dinosaurs. Why?

23:54.040 --> 23:56.800
And this tree is what? 5, 6, 700 years old?

23:56.880 --> 23:58.160
Yeah.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.840
And these rings represent climatic changes.

24:00.920 --> 24:04.480
So in this year or season
in the life of the tree,

24:04.560 --> 24:07.440
a strange event produced an abnormal ring.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.280
- Like what, exactly?
- A volcanic eruption.

24:10.360 --> 24:15.080
This chain of mountains running from
Washington to Oregon is still active.

24:15.160 --> 24:19.120
- Remember Mount St Helens?
- How does that explain the bugs?

24:19.200 --> 24:22.680
After Mount St Helens erupted,
radiation was unleashed

24:22.760 --> 24:24.680
from inside the Earth.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.920
Strange things started to grow.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.360
They discovered an amoeba
that can suck a man's brains out.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.400
A brain-sucking amoeba!

24:32.480 --> 24:36.960
lt's true. ln Spirit Lake,
there's cases of swimmers being infected.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.120
A single-celled amoeba can be mutated.

24:39.200 --> 24:44.760
But an insect is complex. A mutation
would take years and years to evolve.

24:44.840 --> 24:48.240
Maybe what we're dealing with
isn't a mutation at all.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.640
What if it's some kind of
extinct insect larvae in that ring,

24:52.720 --> 24:57.120
deposited during volcanic activity,
brought up through the root system?

24:57.200 --> 24:59.160
Ancient insect eggs,

24:59.240 --> 25:03.320
thousands, maybe millions of years old,
lying dormant until...

25:03.400 --> 25:06.200
Until those loggers cut down that tree.

25:06.280 --> 25:09.240
That would be poetic justice, don't you think?

25:09.320 --> 25:12.320
Unleashing the thing
that would end up killing them.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.400
And your friend Humphreys.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.440
And, who knows... maybe us.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.040
Sweet dreams.

25:25.920 --> 25:29.880
Humphreys might've just hiked outta here.
We don't know he didn't.

25:29.960 --> 25:34.320
Maybe we're letting ourselves get
carried away with this bug story.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
Yeah, maybe.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.080
Going somewhere?

26:28.160 --> 26:30.360
- No, l was...
- Doing an auto repair.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.160
Looks like you're planning on cutting out.

26:33.240 --> 26:38.040
l got to save my friends. They could only
keep their generator going 15, 20 hours max.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.040
- They're gonna die.
- So why are you sneaking around?

26:41.120 --> 26:45.040
The Forest Service guy wouldn't go for it.
He'd never trust me.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.520
He's got no reason to. Neither do l.

26:47.600 --> 26:51.160
l can save us all, man.
We've got ajeep just two valleys over.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.560
All it needs is a battery.
l could be back in the morning.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.640
We can all drive out tomorrow.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.760
You gotta trust me, man.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.160
Radio's back up.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.800
lt's working?

27:18.880 --> 27:22.080
l'm not getting any reception,
so the receiver could be trashed.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.640
And transmissions?
Can you send a message?

27:24.720 --> 27:26.680
We could try.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.560
This is a call for help.
ls there anyone at this frequency?

27:36.040 --> 27:38.200
This is Special Agent Mulder, FBl.

27:38.280 --> 27:43.840
We have an emergency and a possible
quarantine situation. Our position is...

27:51.800 --> 27:54.080
- What happened to the generator?
- l turned it off.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.600
Turn it back on. l got the radio working.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.760
- What happened to the gas can?
- Spinney took it.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.320
He took it? You mean he's gone?

28:03.400 --> 28:07.120
He took a battery and some gas.
He'll come back in the morning.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.440
He gave you his personal guarantee?

28:09.520 --> 28:11.640
He gave me his word, yeah.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.880
The man who gave you his word

28:13.960 --> 28:17.240
has made an art out of sabotage
and defying authority.

28:17.320 --> 28:21.040
He's probably the same man
who put a bullet through my windshield.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.200
At least now we've got one chance
of getting out alive.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.440
One more chance than we had before.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.640
- Or one less.
- What do you mean?

28:28.720 --> 28:31.520
Mulder let him leave with the last of the gas.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.560
This generator's got a quarter tank left.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.480
What about the trucks?

28:36.560 --> 28:39.440
Their tanks were ruptured or filled with sugar.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.760
By the same man we are now trusting
to keep his word.

28:42.840 --> 28:45.960
Then we gotta get back on the radio,
send out a Mayday.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.840
Every drop of fuel we waste is fuel
that'll keep this genny powered tonight.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.800
l don't wanna be waiting around,
hoping somebody heard that transmission

28:53.880 --> 28:57.240
when this thing quits running
about two in the morning.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.320
Do you?

29:24.560 --> 29:26.520
- Mulder,...
- Look, it's done.

29:26.600 --> 29:30.120
l shouldn't have let him go.
Let's just move past it, OK?

29:30.920 --> 29:32.280
Fine.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.360
What do you suggest?

29:35.320 --> 29:38.080
l don't know. We'll think of something.

29:39.720 --> 29:42.600
l think we have a pretty good idea
what happened to those loggers

29:42.680 --> 29:45.240
and what happened to the group in 1934.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.520
- They only found one cocoon.
- lt's a very big forest.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.360
What would you have done?

29:50.440 --> 29:53.920
Would l have made a decision alone
that affected the group?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.840
Cut the sanctimonious crap!

29:55.920 --> 29:59.720
What do you want me to say?
Let's face it, we might die up here.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.520
They may find our bodies spun up in a tree,

30:02.600 --> 30:04.600
or they may not find us at all!

30:05.680 --> 30:09.480
You're right.
And we're wasting time arguing about it.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.080
- What are you gonna do?
- Button this place up.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.560
lf we gotta spend the night in here,

30:29.640 --> 30:33.000
we gotta do everything we can
to make sure the bugs stay out there.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.080
Be careful with that.
lt's the only bulb that works.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.120
l can see them.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.280
You guys, look at this.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.720
They're coming through the wall,

31:48.800 --> 31:51.200
down where it's dark, you see them?

31:57.760 --> 32:00.320
- They're on me!
- lt's all right, Scully.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.720
- Scully, Scully...
- Get them off me!

32:02.800 --> 32:04.960
- Get them off me!
- Stand still!

32:05.040 --> 32:07.640
- Stop it, stop it!
- Can you see them?

32:07.720 --> 32:10.520
- Get them off me!
- They're notjust on you.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.960
That's what that greasy residue is.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.520
We were supposed to be safe in the light!

32:15.600 --> 32:18.760
We are! l think the light
keeps them from swarming.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.560
We'll be safe as long as we stay in the light.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.120
How are you feeling?

32:52.160 --> 32:53.960
l'm OK.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.160
They're oxidising enzymes.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.240
Just like fireflies.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.360
Maybe that's why they cocoon their prey.

33:09.440 --> 33:13.840
So they can oxidise the proteins
taken from the fluids in the body.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.800
What if the generator goes?

33:21.880 --> 33:25.040
Are they gonna swarm in
and drain the life out of us?

33:25.120 --> 33:27.240
We got an hour and a half till sunrise.

33:27.320 --> 33:29.880
Then what? lt's over a day's hike out of here.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.160
We won't make it on foot by nightfall.

33:32.240 --> 33:36.120
Maybe somebody heard our transmission.
Help could be on the way.

33:36.200 --> 33:41.240
You sent that call hours ago.
l mean, help would've been here by now.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.200
Well, l'm not gonna give up on Spinney.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.640
He gave me his word
he'd come back to get us.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.680
And if he doesn't?

33:51.680 --> 33:53.680
We'll think of something.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.760
You got a patch kit
or an extra tube in your truck?

34:45.840 --> 34:47.080
Yeah.

34:47.159 --> 34:50.679
Maybe we can patch this.
And with the spare in your truck,

34:50.760 --> 34:53.199
maybe we can limp down the mountain.

34:55.239 --> 34:59.160
lf not, we can get on the radio
and warn them what's out there.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.720
- You see it?
- Yeah.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.280
Listen.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.320
You hear that?

35:53.400 --> 35:55.400
lt's a car.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.840
No, it's ajeep!

36:05.400 --> 36:08.160
- We gotta move! Let's go, let's go!
- Wait!

36:08.240 --> 36:10.360
What about Humphreys' body?

36:11.160 --> 36:13.120
Leave it. l've radioed for help.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.720
- What happened to your friends?
- They didn't make it.

36:16.800 --> 36:21.640
We're not gonna make it either
unless we haul ass! Let's go!

36:58.720 --> 37:00.520
Dammit!

37:08.440 --> 37:10.440
l don't believe it!

37:11.400 --> 37:14.880
And you talk about
shooting yourself in the foot!

37:21.400 --> 37:23.760
Get outta there!
Get back in the car!

38:47.240 --> 38:49.320
Emergency evacuation situation.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.720
Requesting quarantine facility

38:51.800 --> 38:56.480
for two, possibly three victims
with undiagnosed infection

38:56.560 --> 38:59.520
or exposure to unknown biological vectors.

38:59.600 --> 39:03.600
Repeat, emergency evacuation situation:
two, possibly...

39:08.280 --> 39:10.080
Attention all personnel.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.960
High-level bio-clearance
required on third floor.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.840
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.880
How did the tests come back?

39:56.960 --> 39:59.160
Your respiratory charts were good.

39:59.240 --> 40:03.080
We were concerned about
the extent of damage through inhalation.

40:03.160 --> 40:06.640
There were large concentrations
of the chemical luciferin.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.080
Which is?

40:08.160 --> 40:11.960
The enzyme found in fireflies
and bioluminescent insects.

40:12.040 --> 40:15.760
Our entomologists
are trying to determine the specific epithet

40:15.840 --> 40:18.640
of the insects you encountered.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.560
Scully?

40:27.640 --> 40:28.800
How's she doing?

40:28.880 --> 40:32.800
She's still not out of the woods, so to speak.
She lost a lot of fluids.

40:32.880 --> 40:37.040
Two or three more hours of exposure,
she might not have made it.

40:37.120 --> 40:40.240
l told her it was gonna be
a nice trip to the forest.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.840
How are you gonna contain it to the forest?

40:48.400 --> 40:50.120
What if the swarm migrates?

40:50.200 --> 40:53.680
The government has initiated
eradication procedures.

40:53.760 --> 40:57.720
By using a combination of
controlled burns and pesticides,

40:57.800 --> 40:59.920
they will be successful.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.240
And if they're not?

41:04.920 --> 41:07.320
That is not an option, Mr Mulder.
