WEBVTT

00:07.574 --> 00:09.509
ROZ: I'm sorry
I brought Alice today,

00:09.509 --> 00:11.077
when we have
so much work to do.

00:11.077 --> 00:12.512
FRASIER:
Oh, that's all right, Roz.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.581
You know what? You'll find
another nanny soon.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.582
I'd better.
Yeah.

00:15.582 --> 00:16.583
I have a date tomorrow.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.917
It's my first one
in a month.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.020
A month.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.287
Between spending

00:21.287 --> 00:23.289
my days with you
and my nights with Alice,

00:23.289 --> 00:25.792
I've forgotten what
a real conversation is like.

00:25.792 --> 00:26.593
Well...

00:26.593 --> 00:27.927
don't tell Alice that.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.429
It might hurt her feelings.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.798
(baby crying)

00:31.798 --> 00:33.166
Whoop, there we go again.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.069
Okay. Thanks.
Mm-hmm!

00:36.069 --> 00:37.070
Hello.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.071
Hello.
Hello, boys.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.572
Just look at
the dapper gent

00:39.572 --> 00:40.573
I ran into
on the elevator.

00:40.573 --> 00:41.975
All right, Niles,
that's enough.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.877
Yes, I like the
suit you got me.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.379
All right, well,
tell me about the comments.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.881
Did everybody there
ooh and ahh?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.383
No. People were
pretty much looking

00:50.383 --> 00:52.152
at the guy in the casket.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.121
So, Dad,
how was the funeral?

00:55.622 --> 00:56.623
Oh, it was terrible.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.625
It's not at all the way
Stan would've wanted it.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.527
They did everything
on the cheap.

01:00.527 --> 01:01.928
And that daughter of his--

01:01.928 --> 01:03.430
she didn't even get
the good priest.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.931
She got some rookie
from the seminary

01:04.931 --> 01:06.433
who stumbled
all through the eulogy

01:06.433 --> 01:09.769
and couldn't even pronounce
"Wojadubakowski."

01:09.769 --> 01:12.072
Well, I can commiserate
with you, Dad.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.574
I had rather a bad day
on the death front, myself.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.542
Uh, sherry?

01:15.542 --> 01:16.810
Yes, please, Niles.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.111
I received
a letter today

01:18.111 --> 01:21.114
informing me that,
thanks to my divorce,

01:21.114 --> 01:25.085
I've lost my plot at
Seattle's toniest cemetery.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.021
You mean
you're out of Verdant Hills?

01:28.021 --> 01:29.522
Oh, I am sorry, Niles.

01:29.522 --> 01:32.459
I know how much you were looking
forward to being dead there.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.395
They've wait-listed me,

01:35.395 --> 01:36.896
but I don't
like my odds.

01:36.896 --> 01:37.797
Mm.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.532
FRASIER:
I don't blame you.

01:39.532 --> 01:40.834
One country club fire,

01:40.834 --> 01:42.602
you can kiss
your chances good-bye.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.838
I went to all sorts of funerals
as a child.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.339
My uncle's a mortician.

01:46.873 --> 01:47.740
Lovely man.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.543
He's offered to do my makeup
for the wedding.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.115
I can just hear
the whispers now.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.484
"Did you see the bride?
Very lifelike."

01:59.152 --> 02:00.787
Dad, you know, I'm sorry

02:00.787 --> 02:03.156
about your friend's funeral
not going so well.

02:03.156 --> 02:04.591
Rest assured,
when the time comes--

02:04.591 --> 02:05.492
years from now--

02:05.992 --> 02:08.328
Niles and I will follow
your wishes to the letter.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.195
Thank you.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.498
By the way, Dad,
what are your wishes?

02:11.498 --> 02:13.266
Never mind. I'm not gonna
go planning

02:13.266 --> 02:14.601
my own funeral.
It's bad luck.

02:14.601 --> 02:15.835
But, Dad...
Nuh-uh-uh.

02:15.835 --> 02:17.170
You don't pull
the cord on the bus

02:17.170 --> 02:18.705
until you're ready to get off.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.444
Pull the what on
the what? I don't...

02:27.113 --> 02:29.582
I'm surprised-- I didn't know
Dad had such a bugaboo

02:29.582 --> 02:30.583
about his funeral
arrangements.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.485
Yeah, I know,
it's a painful subject,

02:32.485 --> 02:33.887
but we've got to plan for it.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.388
We all must be prepared

02:35.388 --> 02:37.891
when the cold hand of death
comes knocking on our door.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.727
(hard knocking)

02:43.963 --> 02:45.798
Would you get that?

02:45.798 --> 02:47.734
I most certainly will not.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.476
Pizza. Oh, thank you
very much.

02:58.311 --> 02:59.612
Bulldog.

02:59.612 --> 03:00.380
Good Lord.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.848
Oh, come in, come in.

03:01.848 --> 03:02.849
Oh, heavens.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.317
Oh, you remember
my brother, Niles.

03:04.317 --> 03:05.318
Niles,
you remember Bulldog.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.719
Yes, of course.
Hello, Bulldog.

03:06.719 --> 03:08.988
So, you're delivering pizzas
for a living?

03:08.988 --> 03:10.823
Uh, no,
I'm an eccentric millionaire.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.325
This has always been my dream.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.095
Bulldog, I can't tell you how
sorry I am... Hey, no, no, no, no.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.497
Can the sad face, okay?

03:17.497 --> 03:19.799
I'm just making some extra cash
between radio gigs.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.467
Well... Oh, it's
18 bucks, by the way.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.002
Oh, right. You know,
I-I just stopped by

03:23.002 --> 03:24.504
to leave off
these opera tickets.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.005
I'll be on my way.
Oh, thank you, Niles.

03:26.005 --> 03:27.373
By the way, I'm a little
short of cash.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.008
Do you mind, uh...?

03:29.008 --> 03:31.511
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.313
(whispers): Let's see...
(muttering)

03:33.313 --> 03:35.815
There you are.
And, uh...

03:35.815 --> 03:37.650
a little something
extra for you.

03:37.650 --> 03:40.019
Wow. That's a pretty
generous tip.

03:40.019 --> 03:42.522
Oh, I'll say--
wrong bill.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.597
Hey, good luck, Doc.
I'll see ya.

03:50.597 --> 03:51.598
Thanks, Bulldog.
Take care.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.599
All right.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.567
Bulldog.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.302
Oh, Roz.

03:56.302 --> 03:59.105
Are you delivering pizzas?

03:59.105 --> 04:01.107
Yeah, yeah.

04:01.107 --> 04:03.109
This is kind
of awkward, huh?

04:03.109 --> 04:05.612
Oh, no, don't
be embarrassed.

04:05.612 --> 04:06.913
A job's a job.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.114
No, I mean awkward for you.

04:08.114 --> 04:10.416
This is the first time
you've seen me since, uh,

04:10.416 --> 04:11.651
we had that fling
and I dumped you.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.920
I dumped you, pizza boy.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.188
Yeah, whatever.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.625
Hey, look
who's here.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.628
Hey, sweet pea,
you are getting so big.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.730
Hey, look at that smile;
she likes me.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.131
She's relieved not to be

04:25.131 --> 04:27.066
the least-mature person
in the room anymore.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.535
Who's got a mean old mommy?

04:29.535 --> 04:30.970
(softly):
Roz?

04:32.338 --> 04:33.840
Listen, I think
you may have solved

04:33.840 --> 04:35.408
your baby-sitting
problem.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.409
Bulldog? Are you nuts?

04:36.409 --> 04:37.910
Yes, well, look.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.412
Alice is obviously
crazy about him.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.247
He could use the money.

04:41.247 --> 04:42.849
(coos)

04:42.849 --> 04:43.583
I don't know.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.151
Oh, okay, fine.

04:45.151 --> 04:47.153
Fine, Roz, you just
cancel your date.

04:47.153 --> 04:49.155
I mean, you've been
this long without a man.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.657
What's a few days more?

04:50.657 --> 04:52.091
Bulldog, do you want a job?

04:58.264 --> 05:01.334
BULLDOG:
Okay, come on, one more bite...

05:01.334 --> 05:03.836
and we can watch
Sportscenter.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.206
Have you seen my purse?

05:07.206 --> 05:08.508
Yeah, it's on the chair.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.443
Oh.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.445
Steve is going to
be here any minute.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.447
So, you been dating
for a while?

05:14.447 --> 05:15.348
Actually, no.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.716
Tonight's our first date.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.018
In fact, it's my first date
in a month.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.687
Whoa, you injured?
You pull something?

05:20.687 --> 05:22.021
No.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.490
I guess, uh, no one
quite measured up

05:24.490 --> 05:26.359
to that week you spent
in the doghouse, huh?

05:26.359 --> 05:27.727
Let's get one thing straight.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.262
That little fling we had
is way over.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.763
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.765
I was joking.
Okay.

05:32.765 --> 05:35.234
Well, okay, if you're not going
to have some peaches

05:35.234 --> 05:37.270
we got some Jell-O
in the fridge, huh?

05:37.270 --> 05:38.771
You know, some
naughty ladies

05:38.771 --> 05:40.573
like to wrestle
in that stuff.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.141
(knock at door)

05:42.141 --> 05:44.610
Oh, who's that?
Who's that?

05:44.610 --> 05:46.045
Let's go see...

05:46.045 --> 05:48.047
let's go see who it is.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.050
Hey.
Oh!

05:51.050 --> 05:52.919
Excuse me. Is this
Roz Doyle's apartment?

05:52.919 --> 05:54.454
Yeah, yeah. You her date?

05:54.454 --> 05:55.955
Yeah.
Listen up.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.490
You go out with Roz tonight,

05:57.490 --> 05:59.492
I will rip off your arm,
ram it down your throat,

05:59.492 --> 06:01.961
and use it to squeeze your heart
until it stops beating.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.963
Hey, who's my pretty girl?

06:03.963 --> 06:06.966
Huh? Hmm?

06:06.966 --> 06:08.368
Okay, dirtball,

06:08.368 --> 06:09.769
as soon as you get out of here

06:09.769 --> 06:11.771
you call Roz, and you cancel
like a gentleman.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.272
And, as far as she's concerned,

06:13.272 --> 06:14.774
this conversation
never took place. Got it?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.043
Uh... who are you?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.278
I'm your worst nightmare:
The baby-sitter.

06:21.247 --> 06:24.751
Okay, time to brush
your toothies.

06:24.751 --> 06:25.752
Whoa!

06:25.752 --> 06:26.753
Do I look slutty?

06:26.753 --> 06:28.521
All right, if you're

06:28.521 --> 06:31.057
fishing for compliments,
yeah, you look slutty.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.258
(phone ringing)

06:34.827 --> 06:36.329
Hello?

06:36.329 --> 06:38.564
Hey, Stephen.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.166
Oh, really.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.603
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.
I mean, you won't have to...

06:43.603 --> 06:45.071
(sighs)

06:45.071 --> 06:47.573
No, it's okay.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.875
Yeah, bye.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.677
I don't believe it.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.679
My first date in a month,

06:53.679 --> 06:55.181
and he blows me off.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.183
At the last minute?

06:57.183 --> 06:58.518
What a jerk.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.186
He does not deserve you.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.121
Thanks, Bulldog.

07:02.121 --> 07:03.456
Yeah...

07:03.456 --> 07:05.324
Well, I guess I can go.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.161
Oh!

07:08.161 --> 07:09.662
I ordered a pizza.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.165
Uh, just, uh, have him
drop it by my place.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.166
Oh.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.500
Oh, I'm at the YMCA.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.868
Oh, have him, uh...

07:15.868 --> 07:17.437
well, have him knock hard.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.206
I turn up the radio
to drown out the sirens.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.476
Why don't you just stay
and have your pizza?

07:23.476 --> 07:24.777
Well, are you sure?

07:24.777 --> 07:27.146
Yeah, it's not like
I'm doing anything tonight.

07:27.146 --> 07:28.614
Okay.
Come and tell us

07:28.614 --> 07:30.116
what you guys did
at the park today.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.617
Ah!

07:32.118 --> 07:33.619
We fed the ducks.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.621
We went on a pony ride

07:35.621 --> 07:38.524
and came back for
a whole jar of peas.

07:38.524 --> 07:41.194
Peas? How'd you get her
to eat those?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.962
Oh, there's a trick to it--
you got to pretend

07:42.962 --> 07:44.330
to sneeze them
out of your nose.

07:44.330 --> 07:47.099
How'd you come up with that?

07:47.099 --> 07:48.501
It's an
interesting story.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.503
Actually, don't tell me.

07:54.006 --> 07:54.941
(murmuring voices)

07:54.941 --> 07:56.008
NILES:
Frasier.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.510
FRASIER:
Oh. Good afternoon, Niles.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.478
NILES:
Coffee's on me.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.946
I'm back in
Verdant Hills Cemetery.

08:00.513 --> 08:02.281
Oh, well, congratulations.

08:02.281 --> 08:04.050
Nothing left now
but all that pesky waiting.

08:04.050 --> 08:04.984
(both chuckling)

08:04.984 --> 08:06.919
I haven't gotten
the official word yet,

08:06.919 --> 08:08.187
but, uh, I've
called in a favor.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.989
Bruce Mcguirk is
on the board of directors.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.492
I gave him grief counseling
when his uncle was lost at sea.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.461
And it occurred to me--
there's a plot gone begging.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.932
Tell me something.
Do I have the word

08:19.932 --> 08:21.701
"loser" tattooed
across my forehead?

08:21.701 --> 08:22.568
No, Roz.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.036
But there is a rumor

08:24.036 --> 08:26.372
about a Tweety Bird
on your upper thigh.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.408
(chuckles)

08:29.408 --> 08:30.910
I had two dates this
week, and both of them

08:30.910 --> 08:32.845
have bailed out on me
at the last second.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.647
What's wrong with me?
Oh, don't count

08:34.647 --> 08:35.914
yourself out just yet, Roz.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.283
Yeah, right.
No, no. There's

08:37.283 --> 08:39.184
a young man over there
who can't take his eyes off you.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.020
He's been staring at you
ever since you came in.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.591
(gasps) That's Ted
from the ad department.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.527
We've been making eye contact
for months.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.995
Oh, yes, Ted.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.998
Well, his gaze is so steamy,
it's re-foaming my latte.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.499
(both laugh)

08:53.499 --> 08:55.434
Why don't you go over there
and talk with him?

08:55.434 --> 08:57.436
I can't.
I don't know what to say.

08:57.436 --> 08:58.905
I'll tell you what,
ask him to dinner.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.373
I'm going to Chez Henri myself
this evening.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.707
I'll call and get you a table.

09:01.707 --> 09:02.542
Oh, I don't know;
I'm feeling

09:03.042 --> 09:04.410
a little gun-shy.
Roz, you'd better hurry.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.279
If he sees you talking to me
another minute longer,

09:06.279 --> 09:08.281
he'll think he's got
some serious competition.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.248
(laughs)

09:09.248 --> 09:11.183
Thank you, Frasier.
I needed a good laugh

09:11.183 --> 09:12.685
to loosen me up.
Go.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.254
Yes, hello, Henri.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.255
It's Frasier Crane.

09:16.822 --> 09:17.823
(phone rings)

09:17.823 --> 09:19.325
Yes, I was just wondering--

09:19.325 --> 09:20.326
I'd like to get a table

09:20.326 --> 09:22.328
for a dear friend
of mine tonight, as well.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.329
Niles Crane here.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.830
Hello, Bruce. I hope
you're calling

09:24.830 --> 09:26.332
with good news
about Verdant Hills.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.333
Table for two.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.335
Yes, a plot for one.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.337
By the kitchen?

09:31.337 --> 09:32.338
Oh, Lord, I was hoping

09:32.338 --> 09:33.839
for something
near the fireplace.

09:33.839 --> 09:34.840
Near the parking lot?

09:35.341 --> 09:36.842
I'd prefer the
Serenity Garden.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.344
Oh, the back room
would be fine.

09:38.344 --> 09:39.845
Uh, who's at the next table?

09:39.845 --> 09:41.814
The hilltop is divine.

09:41.814 --> 09:42.848
Who's in the
adjacent plot?

09:42.848 --> 09:44.350
The Ashby's? Wonderful.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.252
The Ashby's? Delightful.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.553
Thank you very much.

09:47.553 --> 09:48.955
I'm so grateful.
Ahh...

09:48.955 --> 09:52.258
Mcguirk got me a shady
spot on the high hill.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.359
You mean...?
Yes.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.561
I'll spend eternity
looking down on Maris.

09:55.561 --> 09:56.295
Oh, Niles.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.563
Checkmate!

09:57.563 --> 09:58.731
(laughing)

09:58.731 --> 10:00.066
He said yes.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.068
Well, of course, he did,
Roz. Congratulations.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.569
And you're all set
at Chez Henri.

10:03.569 --> 10:04.870
Great.
BULLDOG: Okay!

10:04.870 --> 10:08.174
What sorry bastard would steal
a pacifier from a kid?

10:08.174 --> 10:10.676
This stinks!
This is total b.s.!

10:10.676 --> 10:12.478
This... Oh...
found it, found it.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.182
Listen, Bulldog,
I hate to do this to you.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.216
Hey, Alice.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.718
Can you baby-sit
tonight?

10:18.718 --> 10:19.685
I just got a date

10:19.685 --> 10:21.120
with Ted over there.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.121
Really?
Yeah.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.623
Yeah, sure, I can stay.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.358
Hey, way to go, slugger.
Thanks. I'd better

10:25.358 --> 10:27.526
go home and get ready.
Hey, you go ahead. I'll, uh...

10:27.526 --> 10:29.362
I'll catch up with you
after I hit the can.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.830
Oh. Lovely.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.268
Hey, Ted. Right?

10:36.268 --> 10:38.037
Bulldog.
Long time no see. Yeah.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.872
Hey, I hear you're going out
with Roz tonight.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.841
Yeah.
Listen up.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.609
You have her home
45 minutes

10:43.609 --> 10:45.444
after you pick her up,
or you'll be sorry.

10:45.444 --> 10:46.779
(chuckles): Yeah?
Hmm.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.981
What are you going
to do about it?

10:50.816 --> 10:51.651
(snapping)

10:51.651 --> 10:53.386
Oh, my God!

10:53.386 --> 10:54.654
If I'm willing
to do that to me,

10:54.654 --> 10:55.621
just think
what I'll do to you.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.890
Okay, 45 minutes.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.225
Or else.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.165
Hey, boys, feel
like taking a ride?

11:06.165 --> 11:08.000
Uh...
Well, sure, Dad.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.168
Where to?
Well, I got thinking

11:09.168 --> 11:11.103
about what we were talking
the other night,

11:11.103 --> 11:12.605
you know, about me
not having made

11:12.605 --> 11:15.107
any arrangements for myself,
and so I just went out,

11:15.107 --> 11:16.475
and I bought myself
a burial plot.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.411
(chuckling)

11:18.411 --> 11:18.911
Wow.
All right.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.413
Let's go have
a look, Dad. Yeah.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.914
You know, I'm glad to see

11:21.914 --> 11:23.416
you finally realized
there's no point

11:23.416 --> 11:25.418
in being superstitious
about the whole thing.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.354
No, I realized, if I let you
plan my funeral,

11:28.354 --> 11:29.855
that it'd be all
harps, white wine,

11:29.855 --> 11:31.857
and, frankly, a lot of very
pissed-off cops.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.861
Right up here on the left.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.930
Got the whole service
mapped out.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.933
It'll start with a bagpipe
a-marching down the aisle.

11:40.933 --> 11:41.934
Bagpipes?

11:41.934 --> 11:43.436
I'm having bagpipes
at my wedding.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.437
You knew that.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.906
And none of that dainty
finger food either--

11:46.906 --> 11:47.940
big slabs of beef, prime rib.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.408
You can't have
prime rib.

11:49.408 --> 11:50.910
I'm having prime rib.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.445
Oh, for Pete's sake.
No, no, this is lovely.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.447
If you kick off
before I get married,

11:54.447 --> 11:55.448
you'll ruin
everything.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.449
All right,
I'll drop the bagpipes.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.950
No, no, have
the bagpipes.

11:57.950 --> 11:58.951
What else are
you gonna have?

11:58.951 --> 12:00.953
A big cake with a little white
coffin on the top?

12:00.953 --> 12:02.955
Oh, just put a sock
in it, will ya?

12:02.955 --> 12:04.457
Wouldn't surprise me
if you had a hearse

12:04.457 --> 12:06.959
with "Just buried"
on the side of it. Don't start!

12:06.959 --> 12:08.961
I'm warning you!

12:14.700 --> 12:16.202
Pretty great, huh?

12:16.202 --> 12:17.703
Mm-hmm.
Mmm! Yeah.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.205
And I'll put
your mom's ashes

12:19.205 --> 12:20.506
over there on the left,

12:20.506 --> 12:22.708
because that was her side
of the bed and, um...

12:22.708 --> 12:25.111
Oh! See how close we are
to the maintenance shed?

12:25.111 --> 12:26.011
Mmm.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.413
And that's good
because...

12:27.413 --> 12:29.749
You're the first one
to get mowed.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.052
Yeah.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.054
So, do you really
like this place?

12:35.054 --> 12:36.889
Yes, Dad.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.724
Oh... uh, Fras, take about
three steps

12:38.724 --> 12:40.025
over to your left, will you?

12:41.827 --> 12:43.329
Keep going,
keep going.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.330
Oh.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.831
There you are.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.833
Niles, stand
right next to him.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.735
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

12:49.735 --> 12:53.072
Congratulations, you're standing
on your very own graves.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.607
What?!

12:54.607 --> 12:56.375
(laughs):
Yes!

12:56.375 --> 12:58.677
Well, they were for sale,
so I went ahead and bought them.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.679
And, after seeing how much
you like it out here,

13:00.679 --> 13:01.680
I'm glad I did.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.182
Oh...
Oh, but, Dad...

13:03.182 --> 13:04.583
Aw, I know what
you're going to say--

13:04.583 --> 13:06.986
the expense,
but don't worry about it.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.854
Merry Christmas.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.699
(door opening)

13:20.699 --> 13:22.134
(sighs heavily)

13:22.134 --> 13:24.136
Sorry we had to rush
out like that.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.071
Me, too. Is your stomach
feeling any better?

13:26.071 --> 13:29.408
Um... not really.

13:29.408 --> 13:32.111
Can I get you
some ginger ale or...

13:32.111 --> 13:32.845
(cracking)

13:32.845 --> 13:34.180
I really better go now.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.681
Wait.

13:44.056 --> 13:45.391
She's asleep, Roz.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.892
Don't worry,
I won't disturb you and...

13:46.892 --> 13:48.194
Where's Ted?

13:48.194 --> 13:50.329
He ditched me.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.564
What?!

13:51.564 --> 13:53.499
He kept saying his stomach
was bothering him,

13:53.499 --> 13:54.934
but he was looking
at his watch

13:54.934 --> 13:56.001
the whole time.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.504
What is wrong with men?

14:00.272 --> 14:02.575
It's not him. It's me. This
has been happening all week.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.442
No, no, no, no.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.810
Trust me. It is not you.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.212
Those guys are jerks.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.447
Thanks, Bulldog.

14:09.815 --> 14:12.785
Hey, oh, look, if
you're hungry, I...

14:12.785 --> 14:14.787
I was just whipping up
a little something.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.722
There's probably enough for two.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.624
Great.

14:19.124 --> 14:20.626
I'm just going to
go change, okay?

14:20.626 --> 14:22.628
Okay.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.610
(knock at door)

14:39.545 --> 14:40.946
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:40.946 --> 14:42.181
I know. I'm sorry.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.549
You are supposed to be gone.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.551
How many of my own fingers
do I have to dislocate

14:45.551 --> 14:46.886
before you take me
seriously?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.487
TED: I got her home in
45 minutes, okay?

14:48.487 --> 14:50.789
She left this
in the car... (barks)

14:56.295 --> 14:58.063
(sighs)

14:58.063 --> 15:00.900
This smells delicious.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.401
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

15:03.903 --> 15:05.404
Thank you.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.407
Ow.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.409
I guess I'm a little tense
from that date.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.878
Well, allow me.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.813
Ow, ow, ow!

15:17.383 --> 15:18.884
You're tight.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.954
Oh.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.456
I forgot how good
you were at this.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.459
Come to think of it...

15:27.459 --> 15:30.262
you were good
at a lot of things.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.333
Whoa.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.102
Victoria's Secret,
page 39.

15:38.570 --> 15:42.007
Why don't we just skip dinner
and go straight for dessert?

15:42.007 --> 15:42.908
Oh, whoa.

15:42.908 --> 15:45.911
Penthouse Forum,
 page 23.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.913
(Roz laughing)

15:47.913 --> 15:49.915
Are you the new pizza man?

15:49.915 --> 15:52.384
I hope you're not double-parked.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.886
I promise you, ma'am,

15:53.886 --> 15:55.888
I will deliver
in 30 minutes...

15:55.888 --> 15:57.856
or more.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.292
Wait. There's a scented candle
out on the balcony.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.061
Would you get that for me?

16:02.061 --> 16:03.862
I'm kind of naked here.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.831
It's cedarwood.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.267
It promotes stamina
and sexual creativity.

16:08.267 --> 16:09.335
I'll be right back.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.372
Roz, open the door.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.274
Oh, I get it.

16:15.274 --> 16:17.176
Pizza man!

16:18.510 --> 16:19.845
You slimebag!

16:19.845 --> 16:22.147
You've been scaring
off my dates all week!

16:22.147 --> 16:23.382
I don't know what you're
talking about. Cut the crap!

16:23.382 --> 16:25.184
I just saw you
talking to Ted!

16:25.184 --> 16:27.286
This is the lowest
thing you've ever done.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.554
After the way I've
trusted you, this is

16:28.554 --> 16:30.322
the way you treat me? Look,
will you let me in, please?

16:30.322 --> 16:32.124
No!
Come on, it's freezing

16:32.124 --> 16:34.626
out here, as you
can plainly see.

16:34.626 --> 16:37.596
Good. I want
you to suffer.

16:37.596 --> 16:39.031
(sighs)

16:39.031 --> 16:40.599
Oh, don't sit there.

16:40.599 --> 16:43.002
I eat off that table,
for God's sake.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.370
Roz?
Get dressed!

16:44.370 --> 16:45.371
Roz, come on.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.372
No!
Roz, wait!

16:46.372 --> 16:47.873
Wait. Will you
let me explain?

16:47.873 --> 16:49.375
I don't want to hear it.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.876
You make me sick.
Just get out!

16:50.876 --> 16:53.379
Roz, I wasn't just trying
to get you in bed.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.247
Just give me
a second, please?

16:57.616 --> 16:59.118
All right, last spring

16:59.118 --> 17:01.487
when we were together,
it was great.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.722
And...

17:03.722 --> 17:07.593
I didn't know how to handle it,
so I ran away...

17:07.593 --> 17:10.429
But, when I saw you again,
it was...

17:12.097 --> 17:13.965
I figured if I could keep
the competition

17:13.965 --> 17:16.969
out of the way, then maybe...

17:16.969 --> 17:18.470
you and I, I don't know...

17:18.470 --> 17:20.239
we could be a couple.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.307
Us?

17:22.307 --> 17:25.511
I think I'm in love with you.

17:32.618 --> 17:36.021
You're not saying anything, Roz.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.267
Wait a minute.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.202
I know what you're doing.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.071
What?

17:52.071 --> 17:55.441
All this love stuff is just
another way to get me into bed.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.209
No, Roz, no.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.944
God, it's the oldest
trick in the book.

17:58.944 --> 17:59.978
Wait a minute, Roz...

17:59.978 --> 18:01.980
And you're still at it;
you're still at it.

18:01.980 --> 18:05.217
No, listen, listen, Roz. Give up,
Bulldog. Give up, Bulldog.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.222
You can't blame a guy
for trying, huh?

18:10.222 --> 18:11.223
No!

18:11.223 --> 18:12.558
I had you going, huh?
Yes!

18:12.558 --> 18:16.328
With all the dishes
and the laundry... ah!

18:16.328 --> 18:17.563
You're the master.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.132
Yeah. Oh, I even put child-proof
latches on the, uh,

18:20.132 --> 18:21.433
on the cabinets-- you know,

18:21.433 --> 18:22.668
part of my plan
to get you in the sack.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.570
You are such a pig!

18:28.173 --> 18:30.509
Well...

18:30.509 --> 18:32.277
I better be going.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.545
Okay.

18:36.014 --> 18:38.517
Thank you for all
of your help with Alice.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.018
Oh...

18:40.018 --> 18:42.688
I'll see you, Bob.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.059
See you, Roz.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.429
(sighs heavily)

18:59.271 --> 19:01.206
(knock at door)

19:01.206 --> 19:03.175
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wozniak.

19:03.175 --> 19:06.678
I know the balcony
is not for sex play.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.316
FRASIER:
It's Frasier.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.652
And by the way,
charming.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.923
It's open.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.892
Well, I just saw you dash
out of the restaurant with Ted.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.727
I thought,
"My God, what's wrong?"

19:21.727 --> 19:25.030
You are not going to believe
what just happened.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.366
Bulldog just told me
he loved me.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.233
What?

19:28.233 --> 19:29.201
Yeah, he made Ted

19:29.201 --> 19:30.702
bring me home early.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.971
It turns out he's been
scaring my dates off all week.

19:32.971 --> 19:34.706
Well, what did you say to him?

19:36.208 --> 19:38.977
I tried
to let him down easy.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.812
I felt sorry for the guy.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.781
Bulldog. Wow.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.216
He's full
of surprises, isn't he?

19:44.216 --> 19:46.185
Who'd have thought?

19:46.185 --> 19:49.221
(both chuckle)

19:49.221 --> 19:51.490
You know what's
really weird?

19:51.490 --> 19:52.991
I'm going to miss him.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.893
Look at this.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.328
I never had to worry
about Alice.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.330
He kept this place so neat.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.833
And it was really nice
to have someone to...

20:01.833 --> 20:04.136
someone to come home to.

20:05.404 --> 20:08.440
Well, maybe Bulldog--
in his own clumsy way--

20:08.440 --> 20:10.209
gave you a taste of a

20:10.209 --> 20:12.411
more traditional
lifestyle.

20:12.411 --> 20:13.812
Yes, I suppose so.
Mmm.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.581
Who knows, Roz?

20:15.581 --> 20:16.348
Maybe the time has come.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.717
You might be willing
to start looking for a...

20:18.717 --> 20:20.452
What? A husband?

20:20.452 --> 20:22.588
No, I wasn't going to say that. I...
Just because I'm gonna

20:22.588 --> 20:23.388
miss certain things
about Bulldog

20:23.889 --> 20:25.290
doesn't mean I need
to rush out and get married.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.593
Fine. I mean, look at
this week I've had.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.461
Three guys interested in me,

20:29.461 --> 20:30.829
not to mention Bulldog.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.999
I mean,
I'm liking this.

20:33.999 --> 20:37.069
Single life's pretty good.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.771
All right, Roz.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.708
As long as you're okay.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.710
I really appreciate
you coming by.

20:44.710 --> 20:45.711
It's okay.

20:46.211 --> 20:47.479
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:47.479 --> 20:48.747
Of course.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.082
Good night.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.450
