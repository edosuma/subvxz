WEBVTT

04:25.133 --> 04:26.100
Hey.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.641
I know I should've called.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.947
Hey, Michael, I'm really...
I... I'm sorry. I...

04:52.593 --> 04:55.730
- Thirsty?
- Uh, no, I'm okay.

05:10.011 --> 05:10.878
So...

05:13.147 --> 05:15.049
- I just...
- Thought I didn't give a shit?

05:16.050 --> 05:18.083
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you didn't know.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.752
You sure didn't care.
You just took off.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.989
- Okay, I had no choice, okay.
- Right.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.661
- You know what, maybe I should just...
- Again?

05:28.696 --> 05:29.764
Really?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.669
I'm really sorry, Michael.

05:43.211 --> 05:44.245
Do you hate me?

05:45.713 --> 05:47.215
A little.

05:55.690 --> 05:58.358
- You look, um...
- Like shit.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.026
- Just tired.
- Yeah.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.729
Oh, well, you look really good.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.665
God, you got all grown up
and manly.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.366
And you're a spitting image
of dad.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.668
<i>You took after Mom,
thank God.</i>

06:09.670 --> 06:11.839
<i>Yeah,
I guess I did.</i>

06:14.208 --> 06:15.406
How long has it been?

06:15.408 --> 06:16.277
Way too long.

06:17.011 --> 06:17.912
Yeah.

06:39.901 --> 06:41.335
<i>Can I try?</i>

06:46.307 --> 06:47.808
I saved all your stuff.

06:48.376 --> 06:49.442
That was my favorite.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.631
Okay. So, wait.
How do you eat then?

07:12.633 --> 07:13.699
Food carts.

07:13.701 --> 07:16.602
- You don't cook like anything?
- Nope.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.671
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.074
Wow.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.374
Okay.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.543
I'm gonna
help you organize.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.445
This I gotta see.

07:28.249 --> 07:29.317
So...

07:31.519 --> 07:33.252
Where'd you go when Dad, um...

07:33.254 --> 07:36.088
Threw your abomination
lesbian sister out?

07:36.090 --> 07:38.958
- God, what an asshole.
- Yeah.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.094
So after I left,
I went down to San Francisco.

07:42.096 --> 07:45.731
I actually lived on the streets
for almost like two years.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.599
On the streets?
Like you were homeless?

07:47.601 --> 07:48.801
Yeah, I guess.

07:48.803 --> 07:50.171
- Whatever.
- Jesus.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.474
I called home
a whole bunch of times.

07:55.276 --> 07:56.410
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.611
I called and Dad picked up,

07:59.613 --> 08:02.083
and he just hung up
every single time.

08:03.017 --> 08:04.717
I didn't know.

08:04.719 --> 08:06.087
What kind of parent does that?

08:08.122 --> 08:11.991
So anyway, I started
selling my art on the street,

08:11.993 --> 08:14.660
and after a few months,
I actually got into a gallery

08:14.662 --> 08:16.061
and started making some money.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.629
San Francisco, that ain't easy.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.333
Yeah, go figure.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.902
And then,

08:22.703 --> 08:24.837
one day, I met someone

08:24.839 --> 08:26.073
in the gallery.

08:27.108 --> 08:29.775
She was just visiting
from Salt Lake.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.311
But we hooked up.

08:32.313 --> 08:35.179
And I went back with her
to Salt Lake,

08:35.182 --> 08:36.884
and that's when I called you.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.184
I remember.

08:40.187 --> 08:44.188
It was so good to hear your voice that day.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.927
I'm so sorry you had to deal with
all shit with Dad by yourself.

08:51.165 --> 08:52.233
So...

08:53.367 --> 08:54.268
What's her name?

08:54.635 --> 08:55.636
Luisa.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.704
Nice.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.573
And we're happy, you know.

09:01.575 --> 09:05.411
And we live in a house
that we actually own.

09:05.413 --> 09:08.347
And I don't steal shit anymore.

09:08.349 --> 09:10.017
Ta-da!

09:26.700 --> 09:29.403
Why, Michael? Why?

09:30.805 --> 09:32.073
Just be here.

09:37.411 --> 09:41.182
Yeah, already. It's supposed to
be right here. It's always here.

09:42.551 --> 09:45.651
Like a puzzle every time.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.321
Does it have to be?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.428
<i>Just...</i>

10:10.678 --> 10:12.411
Who are you?

10:12.413 --> 10:14.913
Better question. Who are you and what
are you doing in my brother's kitchen?

10:14.915 --> 10:16.350
Gary. Next door.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.950
Evans.

10:17.952 --> 10:19.751
Michael's trusted technical advisor.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.687
Okay. Cool. What are you
looking for?

10:21.689 --> 10:22.621
Sugar.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.089
Sugar?

10:24.091 --> 10:25.693
- Yes.
- Why are you looking for sugar?

10:28.362 --> 10:30.062
Michael keeps moving it around.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.763
Oh. Why does he keep
moving it around?

10:31.765 --> 10:32.967
That...

11:43.103 --> 11:44.805
<i>Michael,</i>

11:45.906 --> 11:46.807
<i>what happened?</i>

11:48.275 --> 11:49.410
Tommy?

11:58.219 --> 12:00.052
What?

12:00.054 --> 12:01.787
- Mrs. Johnson?
- Yeah.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.156
My name is Anna Miller and this
is my little brother Michael,

12:04.158 --> 12:06.124
and your son, Tommy,
has been bullying him.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.160
He beats him up
for no reason at all.

12:08.162 --> 12:12.030
Get your kid
under control, got it?

12:12.032 --> 12:15.269
He touches you again, I'm gonna beat
the crap out of that little shit.

12:23.344 --> 12:25.346
Come on, come on, come on.

12:41.730 --> 12:42.631
Hey.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.400
Yeah, I'm okay.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.269
I am. Sort of.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.773
Yeah, yeah, I just got back.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.545
Same thing as the doc said
in Salt Lake.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.146
Yeah. Yeah.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.115
I'm gonna tell him
when he, uh, gets home.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.187
I miss you.

13:07.756 --> 13:08.789
When are you gonna come?

13:11.760 --> 13:13.127
No, that's great.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.798
Oh, no, no, no. That's fine.
We can just talk about it later.

13:21.001 --> 13:21.869
I love you.

13:23.705 --> 13:24.771
Okay, bye.

13:46.761 --> 13:47.629
Hey.

13:50.598 --> 13:51.666
You okay?

13:52.701 --> 13:54.232
Um...

13:54.234 --> 13:56.203
Not really.

13:57.772 --> 13:58.872
What's the matter?

14:00.207 --> 14:01.710
Can I talk to you?

14:12.486 --> 14:13.487
What's up?

14:15.189 --> 14:16.390
Um...

14:18.292 --> 14:19.694
Do you... Do you want a drink?

14:20.194 --> 14:21.428
No, thanks.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.337
I'm...

14:31.639 --> 14:32.841
I'm sick.

14:36.811 --> 14:38.212
It's something serious?

14:42.684 --> 14:44.318
I... I have cancer.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.023
It, um...

14:52.025 --> 14:54.627
It started last year.

14:54.629 --> 14:57.963
And then it just spread
all over the place.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.198
My... My liver,

15:00.200 --> 15:03.538
my lungs,
and inside of my belly.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.241
So did you have surgery
or chemo?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.709
It's inoperable.

15:09.711 --> 15:13.378
But yeah, I did. I had a few
rounds of chemo hell.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.884
It just, uh, it got a lot worse.

15:22.857 --> 15:24.358
I'm so sorry, Michael.

15:28.696 --> 15:31.265
I've been a useless big sister.

15:33.835 --> 15:35.402
I know.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.608
What am I supposed to say?

15:43.912 --> 15:45.747
I mean,

15:47.615 --> 15:50.518
if this wasn't happening,
would you even be here?

16:03.197 --> 16:04.064
So...

16:05.399 --> 16:08.368
- Dad?
- He died last year.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.738
63, early Alzheimer's.

16:12.740 --> 16:15.808
Too much booze
and bad genes, I guess.

16:15.810 --> 16:17.877
He almost burned the house down
a couple times.

16:17.879 --> 16:20.813
So I got him into a place,
a memory care.

16:20.815 --> 16:23.518
Couldn't even recognize me
for the last year.

16:24.786 --> 16:26.987
Sounds like you've had
a rough few years yourself.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.022
At times.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.396
- So where is he?
- Oh, yeah, this way.

16:59.654 --> 17:02.422
What a sorry mess he was.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.797
Oh, hey. What is all that?

17:10.665 --> 17:12.967
- Just stuff from house.
- Really?

17:13.367 --> 17:14.700
Oh, wow.

17:14.702 --> 17:17.638
- Can I, uh...
- Sure. Knock yourself out.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.839
Yeah, maybe tomorrow.

17:20.842 --> 17:23.709
Yeah. Let me know if you find
any treasure I might've missed.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.257
- Anna?
- Yeah.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.029
I'm okay. I'll be out in a bit.

17:54.909 --> 17:57.810
- You're going in the bedroom.
- No, Michael. I'm fine on the couch.

17:57.812 --> 18:00.447
No, you're not. End of story.

18:02.684 --> 18:03.415
Sips.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.183
Cola?

18:05.185 --> 18:06.852
It's good for nausea.

18:06.854 --> 18:09.156
Gary's aunt told me.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.494
Okay, where is it this time?

18:16.496 --> 18:17.930
And where is Michael?

18:17.932 --> 18:21.199
Uh, which question would you
like for me to answer first?

18:21.201 --> 18:24.003
Why are you being so complicated?

18:24.005 --> 18:28.373
So, Anna, it appears you've now met
Gary for the second time, I guess.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.643
Yes, Gary-next door-Evans.

18:30.645 --> 18:33.613
- You've met my sister, Anna.
- Yes, also, for the second time.

18:33.615 --> 18:35.781
And she obviously
is quite the smarty pants.

18:35.783 --> 18:38.416
Gary, nobody says
smarty pants any more.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.786
- My aunt does.
- Oh, right, your aunt.

18:40.788 --> 18:42.655
Of course,
she's bringing it back.

18:42.657 --> 18:44.557
Hey, Gary, wait up.

18:44.559 --> 18:46.928
So, uh, what do you do?

18:49.196 --> 18:50.730
I work on AI at Face Check.

18:50.732 --> 18:52.999
- AI?
- Artificial Intelligence.

18:53.001 --> 18:56.434
Really? As opposed to, like,
real intelligence.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.938
Facial feature
recognition analysis.

18:58.940 --> 19:02.975
Your face can reveal some very
interesting information about you.

19:02.977 --> 19:04.979
Really? Like what?

19:07.314 --> 19:10.281
- You want to see a demo?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.917
No, come on. Why not?

19:11.919 --> 19:14.254
Okay. Okay.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.454
Okay, don't move.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.690
Okay.

19:17.692 --> 19:19.125
Okay, just hold still.

19:19.127 --> 19:20.793
Okay.

19:20.795 --> 19:22.595
- Okay, ready?
- Mm-hmm.

19:22.597 --> 19:24.030
- Right there. Don't move.
- Oh, my God.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.032
- Okay, there's two more coming.
- OK, thank you.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.967
- Okay, there's one more coming.
- Okay.

19:27.969 --> 19:29.267
No moving.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.571
Very good.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.541
You're a lesbian.

19:35.543 --> 19:37.576
What?

19:37.578 --> 19:39.545
AI Facial Feature algorithms.

19:39.547 --> 19:41.914
Oh, okay, awesome, algorithms.

19:41.916 --> 19:43.348
Oh, there's more.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.550
There's some kind of problem.

19:44.552 --> 19:46.819
Oh, um, so being a lesbian
isn't enough?

19:46.821 --> 19:48.854
No, I mean
another kind of problem.

19:48.856 --> 19:50.455
Not that being a lesbian
is a problem,

19:50.457 --> 19:53.226
because, you know, sexual orientation
is something you're born with.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.732
Program has glitches.
I should get going.

19:58.833 --> 20:00.166
Okay.

20:00.168 --> 20:03.368
Well, it was really nice to see you
again, Gary-next door-Evans.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.039
Goodbye Anna smarty pants.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.846
Does he come over often?

20:12.814 --> 20:14.479
Two or three times a day.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.381
I kind of look out for him.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.451
In a way. He's had
the Asperger's, OCD,

20:19.453 --> 20:21.219
agoraphobia,
and some other stuff.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.791
Oh, no shit. Agoraphobia?

20:24.491 --> 20:26.994
Okay, so what's up with like,

20:27.360 --> 20:28.493
that thing?

20:28.495 --> 20:32.297
It's a ritual behavior.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.900
He's afraid if he doesn't
do that before he leaves,

20:34.902 --> 20:37.705
someone would die or something
horrible would happen to them.

20:38.573 --> 20:39.774
Hmm.

20:40.541 --> 20:42.074
And... And the sugar thing?

20:42.076 --> 20:44.143
I worked it out with his aunt,
not to buy him sugar.

20:44.145 --> 20:46.846
That way he comes over,
I make sure he's okay,

20:46.848 --> 20:48.114
he's taking his meds.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.182
You know, like with Dad,
I always made sure he took his meds,

20:50.184 --> 20:51.318
and, you know.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.921
Wow.

20:55.056 --> 20:56.157
You're...

20:57.925 --> 20:58.826
Hey.

20:59.660 --> 21:00.828
What's up?

21:02.864 --> 21:05.066
I just wish
that I could have been there.

21:07.668 --> 21:10.270
You were there for me early on.

21:11.105 --> 21:13.172
And I remember it all.

21:13.174 --> 21:15.209
<i>Because that's why it hurt,
when you left.</i>

21:16.611 --> 21:17.979
But look,

21:18.713 --> 21:19.947
here you are.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.382
Yeah.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.317
Here we are.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.629
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

21:35.196 --> 21:36.898
Oh, come on.

21:38.232 --> 21:39.667
Come on, babe.

21:41.569 --> 21:44.071
Work with me, babe.
Work with me.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.309
What's this?

22:22.710 --> 22:24.577
"Death with dignity."

22:24.579 --> 22:27.748
- When were you planning to share this?
- Let me explain.

22:28.516 --> 22:29.684
Okay.

22:30.551 --> 22:31.984
So,

22:31.986 --> 22:34.887
given my situation
and what's up ahead,

22:34.889 --> 22:37.225
I wanna go on my own terms,
you know.

22:38.292 --> 22:39.359
You understand, right?

22:40.393 --> 22:41.996
No. I don't.

22:43.264 --> 22:45.998
So what does this mean?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.535
Like it says, I have to have
a written request,

22:49.537 --> 22:51.971
signed by me and two witnesses.

22:51.973 --> 22:54.840
And then I have to have two
doctors confirm that request

22:54.842 --> 22:57.276
on two separate occasions,
15 days apart.

22:57.278 --> 23:00.246
And one of the doctors
knows my clinical situation,

23:00.248 --> 23:03.115
and is the prescriber
of the special medicine.

23:03.117 --> 23:07.253
And then the other doctor has
to agree based on my situation.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.889
You don't even have
a doctor here.

23:09.891 --> 23:11.590
Actually, I do.

23:11.592 --> 23:14.827
I saw her yesterday and she's sending
me to a specialist in a few days.

23:14.829 --> 23:18.766
- It says that you have to be a resident of Oregon.
- I got that yesterday.

23:22.370 --> 23:24.171
You can't do this, Anna.

23:27.675 --> 23:29.476
This is really hard for me.

23:30.544 --> 23:32.544
And I need your support.

23:32.546 --> 23:36.849
You want to commit suicide in my
house, and you need my support?

23:36.851 --> 23:38.517
- Really? Wasn't Mom enough?
- Okay.

23:38.519 --> 23:41.287
- Now, that's not fair.
- No, you don't lay down. You fight this.

23:41.289 --> 23:44.455
- Are you kidding me?
- You don't get the show up, make nice,

23:44.457 --> 23:47.393
smooth it all over with me
and then just off yourself.

23:47.395 --> 23:49.762
So, so like what? You...
You're planning on dying here?

23:49.764 --> 23:53.167
You maybe wanna die in my room,
on my bed. Is that your plan?

23:53.567 --> 23:54.502
I...

24:09.850 --> 24:10.918
Hey, Gary.

24:11.252 --> 24:12.119
Hi.

24:29.770 --> 24:31.572
- Do you need anything else?
- No.

24:34.008 --> 24:36.444
About the other day,
when I revealed your secret.

24:36.811 --> 24:38.110
Secret?

24:38.112 --> 24:40.448
Being a lesbian.

24:41.716 --> 24:43.515
That's not actually a secret.

24:43.517 --> 24:44.819
But there's something else.

24:46.220 --> 24:48.488
It's not a program glitch,
like I said before.

24:48.789 --> 24:49.890
Okay.

24:56.397 --> 24:57.431
Are you ill?

24:59.834 --> 25:00.901
Uh...

25:03.170 --> 25:04.105
Yeah.

25:04.438 --> 25:05.373
I knew it.

25:08.709 --> 25:10.142
So, what is it?

25:10.144 --> 25:12.313
I think you have
a pretty serious health issue.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.546
I see.

25:14.548 --> 25:17.451
- And you can tell this from your algorithms.
- Yes.

25:19.253 --> 25:21.255
You should probably
go see a doctor.

25:22.723 --> 25:23.858
Okay.

25:26.427 --> 25:29.430
You may even have something bad.
You could even have cancer.

25:31.866 --> 25:33.999
You know, Gary.

25:34.001 --> 25:37.204
I actually do have cancer.

25:40.408 --> 25:41.442
See, I knew it.

25:42.009 --> 25:43.644
Yeah, I have, um...

25:44.645 --> 25:46.011
I have seen the doctors,

25:46.013 --> 25:47.813
and I've had all tests.

25:47.815 --> 25:50.349
So you're getting chemo,
radiation,

25:50.351 --> 25:52.651
- all the cancer stuff?
- I did.

25:52.653 --> 25:55.322
But now it's just too far gone.

26:00.027 --> 26:03.130
A friend had a dog
who had cancer, and he died.

26:04.765 --> 26:06.434
- Hi, Michael.
- Hey.

26:08.035 --> 26:09.668
Anna told me.

26:09.670 --> 26:11.403
What?

26:11.405 --> 26:13.374
She has cancer. Too far gone.
Cancer.

26:13.874 --> 26:15.107
Okay.

26:15.109 --> 26:17.743
- Did you get your sugar?
- Yes, I did. Thank you.

26:17.745 --> 26:19.280
So we'll be seeing you
later then.

26:21.649 --> 26:24.216
I'm pretty sure that means
you want me to leave?

26:24.218 --> 26:25.784
You're getting better at this,
Gary.

26:25.786 --> 26:27.922
Thank you. Good bye, Anna.

26:28.589 --> 26:29.990
Sorry about your cancer.

26:30.891 --> 26:32.424
Thanks, Gary.

26:32.426 --> 26:34.693
I'd do all the thoughts and prayers
thing, but I'm an atheist.

26:34.695 --> 26:36.230
So, you know,

26:36.730 --> 26:38.165
just good luck.

26:45.706 --> 26:47.439
What's this?

26:47.441 --> 26:49.542
Called a friend of mine last night
who works at the university hospital.

26:49.544 --> 26:52.111
He helped me find these.
Three clinical trials

26:52.113 --> 26:53.979
for inoperable,
metastatic colon cancer.

26:53.981 --> 26:57.483
Now, I don't understand all the
details, but at least there's a chance.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.017
You know, one of them
could work.

26:59.019 --> 27:01.655
These are from
clinicaltrials. gov, right?

27:02.189 --> 27:03.355
Yeah.

27:03.357 --> 27:04.258
Okay.

27:05.159 --> 27:07.826
These two are phase one trials,

27:07.828 --> 27:11.930
and a phase one trial tests the
safety and dosage of the new drug,

27:11.932 --> 27:16.569
and bottom line is you feel like
shit and you still die quickly.

27:16.571 --> 27:19.671
This is a phase three trial.

27:19.673 --> 27:21.707
And phase three trials tests

27:21.709 --> 27:24.243
how the new drug works
compared to standard treatment.

27:24.245 --> 27:27.045
And people who got
the new drug lived about

27:27.047 --> 27:28.515
two and a half months longer,

27:28.517 --> 27:31.316
and they still have
pretty awful side effects.

27:31.318 --> 27:32.985
Well, there's gotta be
something else.

27:32.987 --> 27:36.989
Yeah, there are clinical trials that
aren't actually documented online.

27:36.991 --> 27:38.924
- Okay, So...
- So,

27:38.926 --> 27:43.530
Luisa and I contacted all of the
major cancer centers in the country,

27:43.532 --> 27:45.697
and we sent over
my clinical records,

27:45.699 --> 27:48.834
and we actually ended up talking to
some of the docs at these places.

27:48.836 --> 27:51.937
And that was a small miracle
in itself.

27:51.939 --> 27:56.110
Us little mortals actually speaking
with the Gods in their world.

27:57.211 --> 27:58.312
So,

27:59.113 --> 28:00.314
do understand now?

28:01.916 --> 28:03.248
This is a chance, right?

28:03.250 --> 28:05.317
- At least you could live longer.
- It's not living.

28:05.319 --> 28:07.286
You don't get to decide that.

28:07.288 --> 28:09.788
Crazy shit miracles happen
all the time.

28:09.790 --> 28:11.690
There is no miracle coming.

28:11.692 --> 28:12.561
Okay.

28:14.428 --> 28:15.630
This is my life,

28:16.531 --> 28:17.930
what's left of it.

28:17.932 --> 28:20.669
And I got one move left,
and I am making it.

28:21.670 --> 28:24.703
And I need your support on this.
Can you do that?

28:24.705 --> 28:26.707
- It's just can't.
- Fuck.

30:08.876 --> 30:10.411
Hey there, buddy.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.516
Long time no see.

30:16.417 --> 30:18.319
<i>You are a princess.</i>

30:18.986 --> 30:20.852
And I'm a frog.

30:20.854 --> 30:25.593
- Now you gotta kiss the frog.
- No, no, no, no.

30:57.358 --> 30:59.925
- It's just not right.
- Says who?

30:59.927 --> 31:02.427
She won't even
consider the clinical trial.

31:02.429 --> 31:03.730
I don't blame her.

31:03.732 --> 31:05.531
I wouldn't wanna be a guinea pig
in her state either.

31:05.533 --> 31:08.133
Okay, how about this,
after she commits suicide...

31:08.135 --> 31:09.868
Oh, my God.
You can't call it that.

31:09.870 --> 31:11.403
Okay.

31:11.405 --> 31:16.274
After she does the death with dignity
thing of ending her life in my bed,

31:16.276 --> 31:17.876
how am I supposed to even sleep
in that bed?

31:17.878 --> 31:20.178
Michael, I know that this is
really hard for you...

31:20.180 --> 31:22.114
I don't think I can even
stay in this house.

31:22.116 --> 31:24.182
Well, you know,
you could always, um,

31:24.184 --> 31:26.286
moving with Gary.

31:27.856 --> 31:32.057
- Not funny, Shonda.
- Yeah, and you're not making any sense. So...

31:32.059 --> 31:34.627
Hey, you're awake. How're you feeling?

31:34.629 --> 31:35.795
Okay.

31:35.797 --> 31:37.062
Hi, I'm Shonda.

31:37.064 --> 31:39.565
Michael has told me a lot of
really good things about you,

31:39.567 --> 31:42.504
and also some really sad things.

31:43.605 --> 31:45.203
Anyways,

31:45.205 --> 31:46.905
I wanted the two of you guys
to meet.

31:46.907 --> 31:48.106
- Okay.
- I gotta get to work.

31:48.108 --> 31:49.343
Okay.

31:53.380 --> 31:55.347
So, I, uh... I guess

31:55.349 --> 31:57.449
Michael told you everything.

31:57.451 --> 31:59.587
Yeah, pretty much.

32:01.790 --> 32:03.589
I know, I'm late.

32:03.591 --> 32:06.291
Working on a very
special project.

32:06.293 --> 32:07.693
Got a bit complicated.

32:07.695 --> 32:09.564
All righty, then.

32:11.999 --> 32:12.867
Yeah.

32:13.668 --> 32:14.636
Right.

32:15.703 --> 32:16.571
Almost.

32:16.970 --> 32:18.472
Mm. Later.

32:19.507 --> 32:20.374
Bye.

32:20.742 --> 32:22.107
Damn, Gary.

32:22.109 --> 32:23.375
So chatty this morning.

32:23.377 --> 32:24.943
No, I'm not.

32:24.945 --> 32:27.281
- That's what I meant.
- But that's not what you...

32:28.148 --> 32:29.214
Oh, I get it.

32:29.216 --> 32:30.552
I'll take one of those.

32:31.218 --> 32:32.419
I gotta go.

32:32.986 --> 32:34.219
- Yeah.
- Sarcasm.

32:34.221 --> 32:35.621
Bye, Gary.

32:35.623 --> 32:37.122
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye, Gary.

32:37.124 --> 32:39.090
- You have a great day now.
- Bye Anna smarty pants.

32:39.092 --> 32:40.626
I'm gonna miss you,
Gar-bear.

32:40.628 --> 32:43.161
- Ha-ha.
- Don't be gone too long.

32:43.163 --> 32:44.463
- See you later.
- Bye.

32:44.465 --> 32:46.899
- Don't forget about me, Gar-bear.
- Bye.

32:46.901 --> 32:47.867
- We love you.
- Bye.

32:47.869 --> 32:49.571
See you soon.

32:51.606 --> 32:52.872
Gary.

32:52.874 --> 32:56.909
He's so sweet in this like,
awkward sort of way.

32:56.911 --> 33:00.680
The sweetest, most awkwardest
way possible.

33:02.282 --> 33:04.619
- Oh, before I forget.
- Mm-hmm.

33:05.219 --> 33:06.886
Lemon haze.

33:06.888 --> 33:09.120
- Nice.
- Yeah.

33:09.122 --> 33:12.959
Helps with the nausea and pain,
and dealing with fabulous stuff like that.

33:12.961 --> 33:14.594
Yeah, I was actually gonna
pick some up.

33:14.596 --> 33:16.261
- But how much do I?
- Duh-uh.

33:16.263 --> 33:18.564
Nothing.

33:18.566 --> 33:20.533
And Michael has my number,

33:20.535 --> 33:24.035
so, if you need anything,
just call, okay?

33:24.037 --> 33:26.037
Hmm.

33:26.039 --> 33:30.843
And, hey, I know that he's
struggling with, you know.

33:30.845 --> 33:33.882
Uh, but I'm gonna keep
working with him.

33:34.883 --> 33:35.917
Thank you.

34:22.129 --> 34:23.598
Oh, man.

35:08.610 --> 35:11.276
Okay.

35:11.278 --> 35:12.914
Let's see what you can do.

35:16.483 --> 35:17.850
What's up?

35:17.852 --> 35:20.153
- Just a little...
- Can I get you something?

35:20.922 --> 35:22.054
Oh.

35:22.056 --> 35:23.190
Good, she remembered.

35:23.958 --> 35:25.891
She's really nice.

35:25.893 --> 35:30.031
I'm glad you guys are,
you know... Whatever.

35:37.404 --> 35:39.040
Oh, wow.

35:42.442 --> 35:43.976
<i>You were nine months old.</i>

35:45.580 --> 35:47.747
She looks happy.

35:47.749 --> 35:51.586
Probably 'cause you didn't poop
your pants during the photo.

35:55.023 --> 35:56.122
"Dear Mom.

35:56.124 --> 35:59.827
"We're so happy you're home
from the hospital."

36:04.732 --> 36:06.632
Do you remember
when we put this

36:06.634 --> 36:09.737
- next to her on the bed when she got home?
- Yeah.

36:10.705 --> 36:12.940
She just camped out in that bed.

36:13.608 --> 36:15.043
Crying all the time.

36:16.044 --> 36:18.878
Gosh. She must have been
hurting so bad.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.647
I actually remember thinking,
I must've done something really bad

36:21.649 --> 36:24.650
to make her feel so awful.

36:24.652 --> 36:28.921
Do you remember
that book we made?

36:28.923 --> 36:33.458
With all of the wonderful things
in the world worth living for.

36:33.460 --> 36:37.799
I think I used up two boxes of
crayons as the official illustrator.

36:40.668 --> 36:43.236
She was never the same
after that first time.

36:44.072 --> 36:46.206
I guess she got it right
the second time.

36:49.309 --> 36:51.577
I'm just so confused, you know.

36:51.579 --> 36:53.715
I was like, what, ten or eleven.
You were...

36:54.414 --> 36:56.115
15.

36:56.117 --> 36:57.719
She was just...

36:59.486 --> 37:00.922
So selfish.

37:03.558 --> 37:05.693
So, do you think
I'm being selfish?

37:09.864 --> 37:13.167
We all have some pain
we have to live with, don't we?

37:15.703 --> 37:17.972
You haven't been
in my shoes, Michael.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.974
And, don't worry.

37:21.976 --> 37:24.746
Luisa and I will find another
place, so we don't bother you.

37:42.830 --> 37:43.763
Wow.

37:43.765 --> 37:45.231
What's all this stuff?

37:45.233 --> 37:48.901
Oh, uh, just some stuff that
Michael saved from the house.

37:51.239 --> 37:53.906
Oh, shit. That hurts.

37:53.908 --> 37:56.776
- That the cancer stuff?
- Yeah.

37:56.778 --> 37:58.646
That's the cancer stuff.

38:37.985 --> 38:41.923
Webster Online Dictionary
defines death as the end of life.

38:42.957 --> 38:46.694
Dignity as a formal reserve
or respect,

38:47.394 --> 38:49.128
and reserve can mean

38:49.130 --> 38:51.933
forbearance from making
a full explanation.

38:54.302 --> 38:56.971
I think the end of your life
deserves respect.

38:58.272 --> 39:00.675
Even if it's an answer
I don't understand.

39:16.057 --> 39:18.425
You're an angel, Gary.

39:20.828 --> 39:23.231
I don't actually believe
angels exist.

39:24.899 --> 39:26.767
Well, I do.

39:29.036 --> 39:30.004
Hmm.

39:31.606 --> 39:34.208
Who is it?

39:35.076 --> 39:36.809
Oh.

39:36.811 --> 39:39.078
Oh, my God.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.780
- Oh, I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

39:41.782 --> 39:43.851
How are you?

39:44.785 --> 39:46.352
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

39:46.354 --> 39:47.822
I'm better now.

39:48.656 --> 39:50.423
It's so, so good to see you.

39:51.659 --> 39:52.727
Hi, Luisa.

39:53.961 --> 39:55.426
Michael.

39:55.428 --> 39:56.364
Nice to meet you.

39:56.664 --> 39:58.063
You too.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.464
- I'm good. I'm good. Come on in.
- Yeah?

39:59.466 --> 40:01.068
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

40:13.446 --> 40:15.249
Anna tells me you work in IT.

40:17.685 --> 40:19.353
I do network security stuff.

40:20.420 --> 40:21.488
Ah.

40:29.297 --> 40:31.866
You know, Michael's actually
a manager.

40:32.800 --> 40:33.935
Hmm.

40:41.008 --> 40:42.910
We should be out of here
in a couple of days.

40:43.577 --> 40:45.878
Yeah, we, uh, found a place.

40:45.880 --> 40:49.014
- You... You can stay longer.
- Oh, really?

40:49.016 --> 40:50.616
And just how long
would that be?

40:50.618 --> 40:53.988
Oh, you know what, thanks,
Michael, but we're gonna be okay.

41:02.863 --> 41:04.163
What's all that?

41:04.165 --> 41:07.066
Oh, that's just some stuff,
uh, from the house

41:07.068 --> 41:09.036
that Michael saved
after our dad died.

41:09.603 --> 41:10.805
Anna's poems.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.042
Our work, teddy bears.

41:15.743 --> 41:16.877
Yep.

41:17.745 --> 41:19.814
You did save Buddy.

41:22.216 --> 41:23.250
Sure did.

41:59.420 --> 42:00.819
Hey.

42:00.821 --> 42:02.289
I have an idea.

43:46.727 --> 43:48.295
- You're doing great.
- Yeah.

43:49.930 --> 43:51.029
Yes.

43:51.031 --> 43:53.031
Better?

43:53.033 --> 43:54.633
Yes. Getting better.

43:54.635 --> 43:57.069
Hey, Gary?

43:57.071 --> 43:58.737
What's your preference?

43:58.739 --> 44:02.241
Computer Networks Security,
or advanced C++ programming?

44:02.243 --> 44:04.278
Advanced C++ programming.

44:05.379 --> 44:08.215
Hey, do we really need
all that video equipment?

44:09.116 --> 44:12.151
A few small essentials,
that's all.

44:12.153 --> 44:14.920
So we get a couple of shots
with a cell phone.

44:14.922 --> 44:16.556
That would not be appropriate.

44:16.558 --> 44:18.924
You may think your dad
as a waste of protoplasm,

44:18.926 --> 44:20.159
- but...
- Wait.

44:20.161 --> 44:21.395
Did I actually say that?

44:21.996 --> 44:23.697
- Yes,
- Protoplasm?

44:24.798 --> 44:26.265
Well, sort of.

44:26.267 --> 44:28.867
I have never said protoplasm
in my life.

44:28.869 --> 44:30.269
I drew a conclusion.

44:30.271 --> 44:31.937
You often get stuck
in an infinite loop

44:31.939 --> 44:34.208
- of disparaging comments about him.
- Oh.

44:34.909 --> 44:36.310
Right. You're right.

44:38.245 --> 44:40.145
Why are we doing this?

44:40.147 --> 44:42.014
I heard that, Michael.

44:42.016 --> 44:43.849
And you know why?

44:43.851 --> 44:45.386
Go on. Say it.

44:46.921 --> 44:49.154
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

44:49.156 --> 44:51.790
Resolution and forgiveness.

44:51.792 --> 44:53.192
Very good.

45:18.953 --> 45:21.088
- How are we doing, buddy?
- Almost.

45:21.556 --> 45:22.555
Almost.

45:22.557 --> 45:24.089
We're not shooting
a feature.

45:24.091 --> 45:26.058
You can't scrimp
on memories.

45:26.060 --> 45:28.329
Yeah, you can't scrimp
on memories.

45:29.296 --> 45:30.798
Do you remember what to say?

45:31.365 --> 45:32.233
Yes.

45:33.067 --> 45:36.770
Okay. Five, four,

45:37.505 --> 45:40.709
three, two, one, go.

45:43.377 --> 45:46.378
We are gathered here
in this beautiful place

45:46.380 --> 45:51.252
to say farewell to our father,
Theodore Samuel Miller.

45:52.386 --> 45:53.555
He tried.

45:57.791 --> 45:59.324
That's it.

45:59.326 --> 46:02.194
We want to memorialize
his parting in this

46:02.196 --> 46:03.764
great place of nature.

46:04.999 --> 46:07.232
Dear lovely death,

46:07.234 --> 46:09.671
that taketh all things
under wing,

46:10.605 --> 46:11.970
never to kill,

46:11.972 --> 46:14.643
only to change
into some other thing.

46:15.677 --> 46:17.211
This suffering flesh,

46:18.145 --> 46:20.946
to make it either more or less.

46:20.948 --> 46:22.717
Yet not again the same.

46:24.018 --> 46:25.419
Dear lovely death,

46:26.120 --> 46:28.122
change is thy other name.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.179
Cut.

46:57.619 --> 46:58.485
We got it.

46:59.453 --> 47:03.756
Gary, that was above
and beyond. Really.

47:03.758 --> 47:06.759
I just never get a chance.

47:06.761 --> 47:08.126
You're so damn good at it.

47:08.128 --> 47:09.662
Hey, guys,

47:09.664 --> 47:10.896
I have another idea.

47:10.898 --> 47:12.264
Uh-oh.

47:12.266 --> 47:15.167
Why don't we all go
to the beach tomorrow, you know.

47:15.169 --> 47:19.137
The weather is supposed to be beautiful,
and Gary can take some more videos.

47:19.139 --> 47:20.305
It's a great idea.

47:20.307 --> 47:21.708
Gary, does that work for you?

47:21.710 --> 47:23.175
Um, wow.

47:23.177 --> 47:25.511
There's a lot of people

47:25.513 --> 47:27.946
walking and looking
and breathing.

47:27.948 --> 47:30.482
- Mostly breathing.
- Well, the ones walking and looking,

47:30.484 --> 47:33.085
would most likely
be breathing as well.

47:35.389 --> 47:37.826
I'm pretty sure
you want me to say okay.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.525
Okay.

47:39.527 --> 47:41.728
But I'll bring
the smaller camera,

47:41.730 --> 47:45.063
and maybe we could use
the Lavaliers,

47:45.065 --> 47:48.100
but I don't think
we need the reflectors.

47:48.102 --> 47:49.502
Oh, Gary,

47:49.504 --> 47:51.738
I thought I did a pretty
good job with the reflector.

47:51.740 --> 47:55.207
Mm, in that setting,
we should be okay.

47:55.209 --> 47:57.746
No amazing reflectors
needed, Luisa.

47:59.313 --> 48:02.682
Sarcasm.

48:02.684 --> 48:05.551
Wow. What a collection.

48:05.553 --> 48:07.854
If only they did some magic.

48:07.856 --> 48:12.658
So did the doc say anything about
chemo, clinical trials, anything?

48:12.660 --> 48:14.428
Yeah, the same.

48:15.262 --> 48:17.331
Babe.

48:19.567 --> 48:23.437
Cannabidiol.

48:24.672 --> 48:27.807
This is a, uh...
a cannabis derivative,

48:27.809 --> 48:31.744
and it treats the nausea,
anxiety and paranoia.

48:31.746 --> 48:33.145
- Paranoia?
- Yeah.

48:33.147 --> 48:35.782
That's right. Paranoia.
You got a problem with paranoia, huh?

48:35.784 --> 48:39.754
- Stop. You're freaking me out.
- Oh, I guess it's not working.

48:40.588 --> 48:41.654
And...

48:41.656 --> 48:45.123
Fucoidan. Fuck a... Fuck a Dan?

48:45.125 --> 48:46.592
What the hell?

48:46.594 --> 48:48.594
- No. It's pronounced as...
- What the hell? Who is Dan?

48:48.596 --> 48:50.095
Fucoidan.

48:50.097 --> 48:53.265
And it is
a brown seaweed derivative.

48:53.267 --> 48:56.101
And it is something
that kills cancer cells.

48:56.103 --> 48:58.203
Oh, so that's a good thing,
right?

48:58.205 --> 49:02.140
That's a good thing. We got little
dancing Dans in there dancing around

49:02.142 --> 49:04.378
killing cancer cells.

49:04.779 --> 49:06.581
Oh, God.

49:07.649 --> 49:10.449
Oh, I'm gonna
shit myself to death.

49:10.451 --> 49:13.084
- What do you need?
- A new gut.

49:13.086 --> 49:16.356
A new life with you
from the start.

49:16.691 --> 49:18.089
Hmm.

49:18.091 --> 49:18.959
Whoa. (SNIFFS)

49:19.661 --> 49:20.695
Sorry.

49:21.028 --> 49:22.294
Lavender.

49:22.296 --> 49:25.733
- I'm... I'm thinking lavender.
- Liar.

49:30.471 --> 49:31.806
How you feeling now?

49:33.340 --> 49:35.373
A little better.

49:35.375 --> 49:37.512
You're seeing the doctor again
next week?

49:39.881 --> 49:42.615
Yeah, we're gonna finalize
everything and then,

49:42.617 --> 49:44.519
we're gonna get the medicine.

49:49.089 --> 49:50.357
Hey.

49:50.859 --> 49:52.694
I'm okay. Okay.

50:33.768 --> 50:35.267
<i>Will Rachael be there?</i>

50:35.269 --> 50:37.739
Please stop talking
about that.

50:41.509 --> 50:43.341
<i>What's wrong, buddy?</i>

50:43.343 --> 50:45.477
Well, like I just
don't know if...

50:45.479 --> 50:49.114
<i>if like she wants me to kiss her
or like if we should hold hands.</i>

50:51.184 --> 50:53.184
<i>Michael, don't worry.</i>

50:53.186 --> 50:54.954
<i>It'll all work out.</i>

50:54.956 --> 50:58.189
It'll be a little clumsy
when it first happens,

50:58.191 --> 50:59.892
but, it'll work out.

50:59.894 --> 51:02.427
Just be a gentleman.

51:02.429 --> 51:04.362
And the most important part

51:04.364 --> 51:06.264
about being a gentleman,

51:06.266 --> 51:07.900
<i>is being gentle.</i>

51:58.086 --> 52:02.722
Trees, grass, shrubs,
trouts, mushrooms.

52:02.724 --> 52:06.424
Shrubs, grass, shrubs, shrubs.

52:06.426 --> 52:08.694
- Bunch of shrubs.
- You good, Gar?

52:08.696 --> 52:12.698
Yes, I am. Shrubs, more shrubs.

52:12.700 --> 52:14.734
So it's not the open air
that bothers you?

52:14.736 --> 52:16.502
No, it's just people.

52:16.504 --> 52:19.972
Bodies and eyes, smells.

52:19.974 --> 52:23.509
- But you're breaking my concentration.
- Oh, sorry.

52:23.511 --> 52:25.778
Shrubs, shrubs.

52:25.780 --> 52:27.647
Ladies, okay?
Anyone need a pit stop?

52:27.649 --> 52:29.050
I'm good.

52:45.033 --> 52:46.734
- It's amazing.
- Yes.

52:57.612 --> 52:59.779
Okay. Okay.

52:59.781 --> 53:01.681
I'm gonna put music
in this, Michael.

53:01.683 --> 53:04.717
- Sure. That'd be great.
- Okay.

53:04.719 --> 53:07.722
Really, Gary. Thanks for doing this.
It means a lot.

53:08.589 --> 53:10.091
It means a lot.

53:11.059 --> 53:12.625
A lot of what?

53:12.627 --> 53:15.262
- You're good, bud.
- I think so.

53:15.630 --> 53:17.098
I feel okay.

55:17.484 --> 55:18.449
Wow.

55:18.451 --> 55:20.385
Oh, Gary.

55:20.387 --> 55:22.221
That was beautiful.

55:22.223 --> 55:23.925
Thanks. Thanks.

56:24.886 --> 56:28.287
I was, uh, 11 or 12,

56:28.289 --> 56:30.589
and, uh, 6:00 a.m.

56:30.591 --> 56:33.792
And I'm in the kitchen, and I'm
like, sketching or something.

56:33.794 --> 56:35.327
And I look up,

56:35.329 --> 56:37.897
and I'm all like, "Michael."

56:37.899 --> 56:39.198
Don't tell this story.

56:39.200 --> 56:42.801
He is sleep-peeing
into a garbage can.

56:45.339 --> 56:46.805
Michael.

56:46.807 --> 56:48.207
What is that?

56:48.209 --> 56:51.210
This is a fidget cube.
It helps dissipate anxiety.

56:51.212 --> 56:54.179
I have a condition called
obsessive compulsive disorder.

56:54.181 --> 56:56.715
And I have to do things
in sets of prime numbers.

56:56.717 --> 56:58.517
- Oh.
- Yes, when it's really bad,

56:58.519 --> 57:00.786
I'll flip the light switch
23 times,

57:00.788 --> 57:03.923
or wash my hands 17 times.

57:03.925 --> 57:06.992
- Damn.
- But when my medication is right,

57:06.994 --> 57:08.994
I can get it down to three.

57:10.531 --> 57:11.897
Usually.

57:11.899 --> 57:14.800
But what, what about one?
One's prime, right?

57:14.802 --> 57:16.568
No, I don't like one.

57:16.570 --> 57:17.872
One is no good.

57:25.746 --> 57:27.882
What do you think happens
when we die?

57:30.785 --> 57:32.119
I don't know.

57:33.854 --> 57:37.325
You can't even look to religion.
They all have different explanations too.

57:38.192 --> 57:39.925
I'm sure that religions evolved

57:39.927 --> 57:43.762
because they were critical to humans
addressing the rapidly growing anxiety

57:43.764 --> 57:47.099
we were developing as part of
our psyche over the millennia.

57:47.101 --> 57:50.736
- Yeah.
- Yeah. All animals have anxiety

57:50.738 --> 57:56.243
essential to brain function as alerting
mechanisms for potential danger...

57:57.611 --> 58:00.579
hunger, pain.

58:00.581 --> 58:03.282
So basically, we take drugs

58:03.284 --> 58:06.518
for anxiety to quell our fear
of saber toothed tigers.

58:06.520 --> 58:08.220
Yes, yes.

58:08.222 --> 58:10.923
Or any other number
of horrible things,

58:10.925 --> 58:13.092
like, meeting deadlines,

58:13.094 --> 58:16.228
or a boss
that is an absolute idiot,

58:16.230 --> 58:19.598
or a bad review at work,
or being around people,

58:19.600 --> 58:24.937
all breathing and sweating,
and talking all at the same time.

58:24.939 --> 58:28.374
That's a whole shitload of insight
I've never heard for you before.

58:28.376 --> 58:32.444
Well, perhaps these challenging
couple of weeks

58:32.446 --> 58:34.780
have been more therapeutic
for me than

58:34.782 --> 58:38.517
all the chemicals I've been ingesting
at the recommendation of doctors.

58:38.519 --> 58:40.786
Perhaps I should just
throw them all away,

58:40.788 --> 58:42.855
and be free.

58:42.857 --> 58:45.157
The free concept is great.

58:45.159 --> 58:47.760
But I don't think you should
get off your meds for now.

58:47.762 --> 58:50.629
We can work in stages.

58:50.631 --> 58:52.066
That'd be better, right?

58:52.533 --> 58:53.434
Yes.

58:54.702 --> 58:56.237
That would be smarter.

58:57.104 --> 58:59.972
I think we go somewhere,

58:59.974 --> 59:03.077
where our loved ones are waiting
for us to join them.

59:03.444 --> 59:04.676
Pets too?

59:04.678 --> 59:06.247
Definitely pets.

59:07.348 --> 59:08.213
I like that.

59:08.215 --> 59:10.949
But what if you don't like them?

59:10.951 --> 59:14.219
My Uncle Geoffrey was a jerk.

59:14.221 --> 59:17.456
So I die, I walk through
the white light or wherever,

59:17.458 --> 59:20.225
and then I'm around Patches
and Ruff Ruff,

59:20.227 --> 59:23.397
and Uncle Geoffrey for eternity?

59:27.168 --> 59:29.701
I honestly don't know
what's gonna happen.

59:32.339 --> 59:34.942
But I don't think
that this is it.

59:39.647 --> 59:40.648
I wonder...

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.787
...high school.
Yeah, my senior.

01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:58.957
- Your poems are like really good.
- Right?

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.560
Thank you.

01:01:00.562 --> 01:01:01.994
- Ah!
- Ah-ha!

01:01:01.996 --> 01:01:04.231
- We all have to make a toast.
- Hmm.

01:01:04.665 --> 01:01:06.165
All right.

01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:08.667
- Wow, babe.
- That's good for me.

01:01:12.139 --> 01:01:14.173
Here's to life,

01:01:14.175 --> 01:01:17.009
and all of its
messy complications.

01:01:17.011 --> 01:01:19.046
Cheers.

01:01:19.947 --> 01:01:21.182
Okay.

01:01:22.416 --> 01:01:25.884
Here's to finding
the love of your life

01:01:25.886 --> 01:01:27.656
when you least expect it.

01:01:28.455 --> 01:01:31.023
And when you think

01:01:31.025 --> 01:01:32.758
you didn't deserve it.

01:01:38.065 --> 01:01:40.299
And to my sister.

01:01:40.301 --> 01:01:44.238
Who ran away, and built
the beautiful life she deserved.

01:01:45.574 --> 01:01:47.241
So happy you came back.

01:01:52.647 --> 01:01:55.180
I would have come back sooner,
if you had just showered more.

01:01:57.017 --> 01:02:00.653
I'll have you know that his shower
situation has greatly improved.

01:02:00.655 --> 01:02:03.989
- Hmm.
- He gets his back washed every now and then.

01:02:03.991 --> 01:02:06.458
None of that talk
around my sister.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.696
You just smell really good.

01:02:09.698 --> 01:02:11.964
- Sugar man is back.
- Gary to the rescue.

01:02:11.966 --> 01:02:15.336
- Hey, Gary.
- Gary, just in time for your toast.

01:02:16.003 --> 01:02:17.071
What toast?

01:02:17.672 --> 01:02:19.738
Vodka or vodka.

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.939
Oh, I...

01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.107
- My...
- Vodka it is.

01:02:22.109 --> 01:02:24.311
Okay.

01:02:25.246 --> 01:02:26.715
- Oh, my God.
- Mm-hm.

01:02:29.584 --> 01:02:31.283
Wow. Very strong.

01:02:31.285 --> 01:02:32.951
You don't have to take it
all in one shot.

01:02:32.953 --> 01:02:35.555
You just have to make a toast about
something you really care about.

01:02:35.557 --> 01:02:39.458
Yeah. Come on, Gar-bear, you got this.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:42.564
Maybe I'll take a little sip
just to help me think.

01:02:44.699 --> 01:02:46.832
Oh. Oh!

01:02:46.834 --> 01:02:47.899
Oh!

01:02:47.901 --> 01:02:49.502
Why do people drink this?

01:02:49.504 --> 01:02:51.236
Just think of it
as like antiseptic.

01:02:51.238 --> 01:02:52.739
- Hmm.
- Kill all the nasty germs in your mouth.

01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:55.642
- I don't think I have nasty germs.
- Anytime, Gar, anytime.

01:02:55.644 --> 01:02:56.611
Okay.

01:02:57.411 --> 01:02:58.345
Okay.

01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:00.412
I got one.

01:03:00.414 --> 01:03:03.915
- Here's to my Acer Predator...
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:03:03.917 --> 01:03:05.250
Cheers!

01:03:05.252 --> 01:03:07.419
It can't be about
any inanimate stuff.

01:03:07.421 --> 01:03:09.722
It's a very good picture,
and its vivid.

01:03:09.724 --> 01:03:12.190
Something that...
Something that involves humans.

01:03:12.192 --> 01:03:14.126
Actual humans...

01:03:16.731 --> 01:03:17.599
Okay.

01:03:21.168 --> 01:03:23.137
Here's to...

01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:24.903
family.

01:03:24.905 --> 01:03:26.405
- Nice.
- Yes.

01:03:26.407 --> 01:03:27.973
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:29.676
I love that.

01:03:29.678 --> 01:03:31.912
Oh, cheers, cheers,
cheers! Cheers.

01:03:33.447 --> 01:03:35.883
Ow and wow. Ow and wow.

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:37.916
Ow and wow.

01:03:37.918 --> 01:03:39.418
Oh.

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.688
Oh, I'm glad there's no
open flames,

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:45.090
because I'm pretty sure my face
would catch on fire right now.

01:03:45.092 --> 01:03:47.292
Okay, so you gonna,
you gonna pass on this?

01:03:47.294 --> 01:03:49.828
Oh, keep that
a million miles away.

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:51.531
For now.

01:03:51.533 --> 01:03:53.899
Forever, Anna smarty pants.

01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:35.369
Come in.

01:05:37.204 --> 01:05:38.270
How are you doing?

01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:40.205
- I've been better.
- You need anything?

01:05:40.207 --> 01:05:41.975
A new body.

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.411
What's that?

01:05:45.446 --> 01:05:47.580
Oh, my God, your poems.

01:05:47.582 --> 01:05:49.715
I guess the old man
didn't toss them.

01:05:49.717 --> 01:05:51.517
- They're beautiful.
- No, they're not.

01:05:51.519 --> 01:05:53.952
It's just a bunch
of stupid teenage staff.

01:05:53.954 --> 01:05:55.555
Stop it.

01:05:55.557 --> 01:05:58.891
"I don't wanna be
the last bad thought recalled

01:05:58.893 --> 01:06:02.862
<i>"Nor some dredge of circumstance
at which to be appalled</i>

01:06:02.864 --> 01:06:04.463
"Let me be a free spirit

01:06:04.465 --> 01:06:07.365
<i>"A breeze of life
in your weary mind</i>

01:06:07.367 --> 01:06:09.234
"Something that once lost

01:06:09.236 --> 01:06:11.069
"You may again be pleased to..."

01:06:11.071 --> 01:06:12.339
Oh, God, I don't feel good.

01:06:22.182 --> 01:06:23.050
Here she is.

01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:25.520
Your sis.

01:06:26.019 --> 01:06:27.454
Anna, the artist.

01:06:30.825 --> 01:06:32.190
Wow.

01:06:32.192 --> 01:06:34.727
Anna's showing
in two galleries in Utah,

01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:38.332
and still a couple
in San Francisco.

01:06:40.367 --> 01:06:42.102
These are amazing.

01:06:44.104 --> 01:06:45.038
Thanks.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:46.908
It's fun while it lasted.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.355
So, Dr. Davis,

01:07:03.357 --> 01:07:05.390
this is my brother Michael.

01:07:05.392 --> 01:07:07.627
- Hi.
- And his friend Shonda.

01:07:07.629 --> 01:07:11.196
- Hi.
- And this is my girlfriend, Luisa.

01:07:11.198 --> 01:07:12.967
It's very good to meet you all.

01:07:13.868 --> 01:07:16.334
So do we need
to sign something again?

01:07:16.336 --> 01:07:17.837
Uh, no.

01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:20.540
Uh, your documentation
is all in order.

01:07:20.542 --> 01:07:22.875
I do need to ask you, um...

01:07:22.877 --> 01:07:25.110
I need to verify
one more time

01:07:25.112 --> 01:07:27.747
whether or not this is
really something you wanna do.

01:07:27.749 --> 01:07:28.750
It is.

01:07:29.617 --> 01:07:31.517
And you've spoken
to your specialists,

01:07:31.519 --> 01:07:34.488
and they have talked to you
about clinical trials?

01:07:34.822 --> 01:07:35.690
He did.

01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:38.626
And you're not interested?

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:41.861
Interested?

01:07:41.863 --> 01:07:43.831
Sometimes we see
surprising results.

01:07:45.432 --> 01:07:47.001
Yes.

01:07:47.467 --> 01:07:48.836
I have heard that.

01:07:49.904 --> 01:07:54.040
Uh, I have also heard
about the side effects.

01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:58.343
And I don't wanna die in a hospital
with IVs and tubes and monitors.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.885
I wanna be able to say goodbye with a
clear head to the people that I love.

01:08:05.152 --> 01:08:07.185
And I want them there with me,

01:08:07.187 --> 01:08:08.155
when I...

01:08:10.324 --> 01:08:11.659
Wherever.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:15.763
Yeah.

01:08:18.032 --> 01:08:18.899
Okay.

01:08:21.468 --> 01:08:23.435
So there are a couple of pills

01:08:23.437 --> 01:08:26.505
that you're going to need to take
before you take the main medicine,

01:08:26.506 --> 01:08:27.974
so you don't throw that up.

01:08:27.975 --> 01:08:30.175
And you'll need to empty
the contents

01:08:30.176 --> 01:08:34.947
of 100 capsules into a glass
and mix it with water or juice.

01:08:34.948 --> 01:08:36.782
And you're gonna
wanna drink that down,

01:08:36.783 --> 01:08:39.886
fairly quickly, and you're gonna
wanna keep that down. Okay?

01:08:42.356 --> 01:08:44.055
Um, there, uh,

01:08:44.058 --> 01:08:48.359
there's a lot of people who...
who never fill the prescriptions.

01:08:48.362 --> 01:08:49.629
And there's some who do,

01:08:49.631 --> 01:08:52.800
and they never...
They never take the medicines.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.433
You need to know that

01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:57.572
you can change your mind
at any time.

01:08:57.939 --> 01:08:58.805
Okay?

01:09:00.173 --> 01:09:01.241
I know.

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:03.944
Okay.

01:09:06.313 --> 01:09:07.615
Thank you.

01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:18.158
So I just, uh, I wanna say
thank you so much for

01:09:18.792 --> 01:09:21.993
coming to my office on time.

01:09:23.898 --> 01:09:25.430
Uh, so,

01:09:25.432 --> 01:09:28.670
Dr. Davis said that
I have to empty

01:09:29.435 --> 01:09:32.138
all of these 100 capsules,

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.776
and mix it with that.

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:38.778
And I have to just
knock it back really fast,

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:40.412
and then keep it down.

01:09:40.413 --> 01:09:43.017
So, no problemo.

01:10:14.214 --> 01:10:15.183
Oh.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:16.818
Gary.

01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:21.689
Hey.

01:10:27.895 --> 01:10:29.229
It's okay.

01:10:32.533 --> 01:10:33.768
Will you stay?

01:10:36.637 --> 01:10:38.005
I want you to.

01:10:38.673 --> 01:10:40.108
If you want to.

01:10:42.476 --> 01:10:44.045
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.648
I can't believe
I just said that.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.927
That was some
disgusting shit.

01:11:34.929 --> 01:11:36.296
You wanna go lie down?

01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:39.299
Not quite yet.

01:11:40.268 --> 01:11:41.600
I, uh...

01:11:41.602 --> 01:11:44.005
I wanna say a few things first.

01:11:47.508 --> 01:11:48.810
Michael...

01:11:51.145 --> 01:11:52.312
I'm so sorry...

01:11:53.548 --> 01:11:54.680
that I didn't have
the courage

01:11:54.682 --> 01:11:57.785
to reconnect with you
after so long.

01:11:59.687 --> 01:12:01.889
But I'm really glad that I did.

01:12:03.257 --> 01:12:06.759
Thank you for being
so loving,

01:12:06.761 --> 01:12:08.863
and so forgiving.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.168
Shonda.

01:12:15.102 --> 01:12:18.336
Thank you for being
like a sister to me

01:12:18.338 --> 01:12:21.073
in the short time
that I've known you.

01:12:21.075 --> 01:12:23.108
And I, I really hope

01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:26.411
that you can share your warm
heart with my little brother

01:12:26.413 --> 01:12:29.317
for very a long time.

01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:34.222
Gary.

01:12:35.957 --> 01:12:39.658
You might be the smartest,

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:43.831
kindest, funniest guy
that I've ever known.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.236
And thank you
for letting me in.

01:13:02.415 --> 01:13:04.252
And Luisa,

01:13:05.519 --> 01:13:07.889
the love of my life...

01:13:08.656 --> 01:13:09.688
Oh.

01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:12.260
I will always
be with you.

01:13:14.494 --> 01:13:16.964
Thank you for saving me.

01:13:18.165 --> 01:13:19.934
And for loving me.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.814
Oh, God. Okay. Oh.

01:13:35.816 --> 01:13:38.150
I just, I wanna...

01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:40.988
I just wanna share
a little poem...

01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:44.258
from Mary Lee Hall.

01:13:49.664 --> 01:13:52.166
It's called <i>Turn Again To Life.</i>
