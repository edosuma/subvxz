10:39.239 --> 10:40.438
In my defense,

10:40.474 --> 10:42.941
I'm actually considered to be
quite funny in some circles.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.175
Okay?

10:45.479 --> 10:48.446
Looks like
this is your first time here?

10:48.482 --> 10:50.315
Caught me on that one.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.650
I'm mark north.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.817
This is kyra,

10:52.853 --> 10:55.220
my sidekick
and also my daughter.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.721
Hi.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.090
Amy atwater.
Nice to meet you.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.626
So what do you think?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.596
It's awesome.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.798
I read up on it a little bit
before I got here,

11:06.833 --> 11:10.335
but, uh, the photos
don't do it justice.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.003
Not yet, anyway.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.304
Suzie falls...

11:13.340 --> 11:15.807
One of our most popular spots.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.575
She is a bit temperamental.

11:17.611 --> 11:18.743
Temperamental?

11:18.779 --> 11:19.978
Oh, yeah.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.113
Waterfalls have
distinct personalities

11:22.149 --> 11:23.281
once you get to know them.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.949
Just like people.

11:24.985 --> 11:28.486
Huh. I'm guessing
you're a park ranger?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.855
Tour guide.
At the lodge.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.157
Oh, that's where I'm staying.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.358
Oh, cool.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.660
I need to get back
to send an email.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.762
Can you tell me
the fastest way?

11:37.798 --> 11:40.699
I somehow took the long cut
to get here.

11:40.734 --> 11:41.666
Yeah, sure.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.636
So, you just follow
the main trail there.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.172
Keep going until
you get to number three.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.206
Go left,

11:48.241 --> 11:49.374
and stay left,

11:49.409 --> 11:51.443
follow the signs
back to the lodge.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.778
It's a bit up-and-down,
but it's pretty easy.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.781
I think I can handle that.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.050
Well... Thank you.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.020
No problem.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.456
So, uh,
maybe I'll see you around?

12:04.491 --> 12:05.990
Well, if you're staying
at the lodge,

12:06.026 --> 12:06.858
then for sure.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.359
Bye.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.161
Bye!

12:12.232 --> 12:13.565
Well, she's really nice.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.467
Yeah, she is.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.634
And pretty.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.670
Is she?

12:18.705 --> 12:19.804
Didn't notice.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.139
[kyra snickers]

12:21.174 --> 12:23.007
[♪♪♪]

12:29.449 --> 12:31.216
yes that way.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.356
Yeah.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.097
Wow! I make
some really good sandwiches.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.332
You really do.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.239
Hey!

12:54.274 --> 12:55.140
Hey.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.077
"long cut"?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.946
What? No. No, no, no.
I, uh...

13:01.982 --> 13:03.548
I've just been taking
a lot of pictures

13:03.583 --> 13:05.450
with different lighting,
you know,

13:05.485 --> 13:06.951
and I wanna make sure
I didn't miss anything,

13:06.987 --> 13:08.753
but I'm all done now.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.221
Oh, so you walked a mile
out of your way

13:10.257 --> 13:12.090
to get that perfect shot?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.793
Yeah! Yeah, I was, uh...

13:14.828 --> 13:17.495
Exploring
and stuff like that.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.599
Would you like us to show you
the way back to the lodge?

13:21.635 --> 13:25.236
Well... If you guys
are on your way there,

13:25.272 --> 13:26.971
might as well walk together.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.139
Sure.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.541
Uh, I do have

13:29.576 --> 13:32.310
a flat rate of $500
for guided tours, though.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.878
-Oh!
-Yeah.

13:33.914 --> 13:34.879
Um, uh...

13:34.915 --> 13:35.814
Well--

13:35.849 --> 13:37.482
it's one of his bad dad jokes.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.551
[laughs]

13:39.586 --> 13:40.652
she's laughing.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.654
It was kinda funny.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.621
Okay, come on.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.123
I'll show you the way.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.224
Oh, great.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.092
[mark] all right, everyone,
pack up your sandwiches.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.961
We got a new person
joining the group.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.832
[amy] I-- I mean, I already
know how to get there.

13:53.867 --> 13:54.833
[kyra and mark, overlapping]"
yeah, of course.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.568
[mark] so, uh, up we go.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.403
It's just nice to have
company sometimes, you know?

13:58.438 --> 13:59.437
That's the thing.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.371
[mark] oh, absolutely.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.011
I know
this is none of my business,

14:07.047 --> 14:08.613
but if you're serious
about hiking this area,

14:08.648 --> 14:10.815
you're gonna need
better shoes than those.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.016
These are really comfortable!

14:12.052 --> 14:13.051
And dangerous.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.019
A lot of these trails
to the other waterfalls

14:15.055 --> 14:16.087
are pretty steep.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.123
Well, I'll keep that in mind,

14:19.159 --> 14:21.960
especially if I'm gonna
find my way to redwood falls.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.328
Redwood falls?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.495
Have you heard of it?

14:24.531 --> 14:26.030
Of course, I've heard of it.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.166
One of the great myths
of our time.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.701
Doesn't exist, though.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.202
I'm told that's what

14:31.238 --> 14:33.805
the locals tell people
so they don't go looking for it.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.473
-Mm.
-Have you seen it?

14:35.508 --> 14:36.774
No one has.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.444
Is that the sp-1?

14:39.479 --> 14:40.678
It is.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.780
Wow. You know your cameras.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.616
I love photography.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.885
I saw that one on
an instagram account I follow.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.887
It looks awesome.

14:48.922 --> 14:49.821
My dad says
it's too expensive.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.289
Because it is.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.626
Do want to try it?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.294
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.229
Okay.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.633
Neck strap--
always keep it around your neck.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.234
That's kind of a rule of thumb

15:03.270 --> 15:04.969
when you shoot
outside the studio.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.905
'kay, you got
the shutter button right there,

15:06.940 --> 15:08.506
and if you want
to zoom in or out,

15:08.541 --> 15:09.841
just gently...

15:09.876 --> 15:11.910
Twist the lens.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.912
'kay.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.480
[shutter snapping]

15:18.118 --> 15:18.983
oh, wow.

15:19.019 --> 15:19.918
Oh!

15:19.953 --> 15:21.819
A hummingbird!

15:21.855 --> 15:24.656
Wow.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.424
Oh, that's a really good shot.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.425
Really?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.427
She is good.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.863
Seriously... Kyra.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.598
The way you framed that,

15:33.633 --> 15:34.766
those are
some great instincts.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.100
Thanks.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.569
I wish I had
a better camera, though.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.438
Your phone will do for now.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.539
He's right.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.741
It's the singer,
not the song.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.244
It's an old saying.
The point is--

15:46.279 --> 15:47.512
if you have an eye
for capturing a moment,

15:47.547 --> 15:51.950
it doesn't matter if you have
$1 camera or a $1,000 camera.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.385
Then why do you have
a $1,000 camera?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.621
It's a little bit more
than that.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.122
But it's got
some really cool stuff,

15:58.158 --> 15:59.624
like dynamic range

15:59.659 --> 16:01.359
and geotagging,
which helps you remember

16:01.394 --> 16:02.794
where you were
when you took the picture.

16:02.829 --> 16:03.962
See?

16:03.997 --> 16:05.229
Keep walking.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.464
[kyra sighs dramatically]

16:06.499 --> 16:08.066
[amy chuckles]

16:10.003 --> 16:12.537
you can get
some proper shoes in there.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.871
I got a tour group
leaving in a few minutes,

16:13.907 --> 16:15.039
or I'd help you out.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.107
I think I can manage.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.942
Sure you can find your way?

16:17.978 --> 16:20.411
Might be a challenge,
but I hope so.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.813
However, I might need
some suggestions

16:21.848 --> 16:24.382
on how to find a few
of the other waterfalls?

16:24.417 --> 16:25.416
What's this for anyway?

16:25.452 --> 16:26.918
You're on
some kind of assignment?

16:26.953 --> 16:29.587
Yeah.
<i> Explorer global magazine.</i>

16:29.622 --> 16:31.956
We're doing a piece
on waterfalls.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.624
Well, you've come
to the right place.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.594
Well, thanks
for walking me out.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.563
Next time,
stick with a tour group.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.430
I will.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.499
Thanks for letting me
use your camera.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.534
-You're welcome.
-Good luck.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.271
[mark] that's a really good
photo you took.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.742
[♪♪♪]

17:16.002 --> 17:17.869
so I was singing
since I was, like, five,

17:17.904 --> 17:19.937
so make sure you come
to the open mic this week.

17:19.973 --> 17:20.972
It's gonna be lovely.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.273
I could put your name
on the list, if you want.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.308
Room 112. Okay?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.045
Good morning, leo.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.146
Morning, amy.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.348
Hey, leo, quick question.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.082
Yeah.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.318
If I was looking
for waterfalls

17:34.354 --> 17:36.954
that have never been found,
or rare,

17:36.990 --> 17:39.157
who would be my go-to person?

17:39.192 --> 17:41.125
Rare, never-seen waterfalls?

17:41.161 --> 17:42.093
Yeah.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.730
You didn't hear it from me...

17:45.765 --> 17:47.832
But that would be
mark north.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.567
Mark north?

17:49.602 --> 17:50.735
Yeah, but "never to be found"

17:50.770 --> 17:52.804
is the way that mark
likes to keep it,

17:52.839 --> 17:54.205
if you know what I'm saying.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.239
I think?

17:55.275 --> 17:56.974
Let's just say,

17:57.010 --> 17:59.644
don't say that you're after
never-to-be-found waterfalls.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.079
Got it.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.346
You pickin' up
what I'm puttin' down?

18:02.382 --> 18:03.548
-Oh, yeah.
-All right.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.516
-Thank you, leo!
-No problem.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.289
[♪♪♪]

18:16.262 --> 18:17.929
hmm.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.564
Even more obvious?

18:19.599 --> 18:20.932
It screams

18:20.967 --> 18:22.567
"help."

18:22.602 --> 18:24.235
maybe that's a good thing.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.269
Let me turn in this paperwork,

18:25.305 --> 18:27.271
then I'll give you
some of my recommendations.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.807
I would love that.
Thanks.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.881
Hey! There you are.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.717
I never heard back from you.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.253
Sorry. It feels like
it's been dawn-till-dusk lately.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.421
Oh, tell me about it.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.022
I'm booked up
through next week.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.357
Did you cut your hair?

18:46.392 --> 18:47.391
My hair?

18:47.427 --> 18:49.060
Looks different.
It's nice.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.428
Nope, not recently.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.796
Your beard?
Something different there?

18:51.831 --> 18:52.730
Mm...

18:52.765 --> 18:54.932
Feels the same.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.634
Oh, yeah?
Little-- little more color?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.302
I mean, I do work outside,
so it's possible.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.804
Right.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.405
Hey, I'm just
helping someone out,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.741
so I'll catch up with you
later, okay?

19:03.776 --> 19:05.076
All right.
I can't wait.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.078
I'll just check my schedule.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.380
All right.

19:09.415 --> 19:12.016
Let's see whatcha got there.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.921
So, these boots look nice.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.123
They're expensive
and worthless.

19:19.159 --> 19:19.891
[astonished chuckle]

19:19.926 --> 19:21.058
then why are
they so expensive?

19:21.094 --> 19:23.661
Because a lot of people
just care about how they look.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.996
What size are you?

19:25.031 --> 19:26.998
Uh, eight and a half.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.032
Bobby,

19:28.067 --> 19:29.567
can I get an eight-and-a-half
in the farrell?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.335
Mark, yeah, absolutely.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.870
So, uh...

19:34.040 --> 19:37.241
...How do the hiking tours
work, exactly?

19:37.277 --> 19:38.442
Pretty complicated.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.178
You sign up over there.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.480
This is
the most important part--

19:42.515 --> 19:44.482
you pick a tour you want...

19:44.517 --> 19:47.151
<i> Then</i> you follow the tour
on the tour

19:47.187 --> 19:48.920
on the selected day and time
of the tour.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.254
Ha, ha.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.490
I mean...

19:52.525 --> 19:55.693
Is there one specific
for the waterfalls?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.295
Several.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.530
Redwood falls?

19:59.566 --> 20:01.365
Right after the unicorn tour.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.201
Sounds fun.

20:03.236 --> 20:06.370
So, uh, how much
for private tours?

20:06.406 --> 20:08.839
We actually don't do
private tours.

20:08.875 --> 20:09.840
And unfortunately,
there's a wait list

20:09.876 --> 20:10.808
for most of our group tours.

20:10.843 --> 20:14.679
Well, my company will pay you,
handsomely--

20:14.714 --> 20:17.648
maybe even your flat rate
to help lost people

20:17.684 --> 20:19.317
find their way
back to the lodge.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.185
[chuckles]
I'm booked every day.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.520
You don't have one day off?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.889
Well, tomorrow is my day off.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.524
Except that
when it is my day off,

20:26.559 --> 20:28.226
I always spend it
with my daughter.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.460
No exceptions.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.163
That's a pretty great answer.

20:32.198 --> 20:35.499
But begs the question...

20:35.535 --> 20:37.468
What do you two do together

20:37.503 --> 20:39.136
on these days off?

20:39.172 --> 20:40.338
Believe it or not,

20:40.373 --> 20:42.006
sometimes...

20:42.041 --> 20:43.841
We go hiking.

20:43.876 --> 20:47.211
Ah, I had a hunch.

20:47.247 --> 20:51.349
Um, I will take these boots
and a pair of socks, please.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.217
Right. Socks, yeah.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.520
Okay, here's the deal.

20:56.556 --> 21:00.024
I have to photograph
at least four of the waterfalls

21:00.059 --> 21:01.392
by the end of the week.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.027
And not the simple ones--

21:03.062 --> 21:05.529
I need to capture the ones
that people don't see.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.366
Like, uh, little bessie.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.568
"betsy." little betsy.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.570
See? That's the point.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.105
I'm going to get it wrong
in the article.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.173
And, to top it off,

21:16.209 --> 21:18.009
there's a high probability
that I'll get lost

21:18.044 --> 21:20.878
or eaten by a grizzly bear,

21:20.913 --> 21:22.513
never seen again.

21:22.548 --> 21:23.681
Ooh, in this neck of the woods,

21:23.716 --> 21:25.683
grizzlies are no joking matter.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.084
Seriously?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.719
Bob, you better put
some bear spray in there.

21:28.755 --> 21:29.687
Good idea.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.025
Even more reason
why I need help.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.527
[snorts] you're not very good
with rejection, are you?

21:36.562 --> 21:37.528
Mm.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.096
Uh, how much?

21:39.132 --> 21:42.199
All right, then.
That'll be 189.95.

21:42.235 --> 21:43.434
Perfect.

21:43.469 --> 21:47.038
So, listen, I've been chasing
waterfalls my entire life--

21:47.073 --> 21:48.739
in a manner of speaking--

21:48.775 --> 21:51.442
so I just don't want
to come up short on this one.

21:51.477 --> 21:54.645
And I didn't
tell you this before,

21:54.681 --> 21:58.082
but this assignment
is my big break,

21:58.117 --> 22:01.052
and I've been waiting
for my big break my whole life,

22:01.087 --> 22:02.887
so it's important.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.256
All right.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.124
On one condition.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.392
Kyra comes with us.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.994
Even better.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.264
So... Does that mean
you're hired?

22:13.299 --> 22:14.498
On my day off.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.733
Duly noted.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.435
-8:00 a.M.
-I'll be early.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.838
And here.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.373
Perfect.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.283
[♪♪♪]

22:34.454 --> 22:36.120
thanks for doing this.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.322
Well, we'll see
how appreciative you are later.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.824
This is a tough hike.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.293
I'm a lot tougher than I look.

22:42.328 --> 22:44.261
Somehow, I don't doubt that.

22:44.297 --> 22:45.963
[kyra claps loudly]

22:45.998 --> 22:47.832
what's with the clapping?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.835
Lets the bears
know we are coming.

22:50.870 --> 22:51.702
When out in the woods,

22:51.738 --> 22:53.671
one needs to let themselves
be known.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.705
[clap-clap]

22:54.741 --> 22:56.173
good to know.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.709
Dad, I'm gonna go
further ahead.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.678
But don't worry,
I'll meet you before I go down.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.149
Is kyra okay?

23:05.184 --> 23:07.485
She's a lot less chatty
than she was the other day.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.286
Not entirely sure,

23:09.322 --> 23:11.355
but I think
it's because she likes a boy.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.623
A boy?

23:12.658 --> 23:13.958
Too young, right?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.526
Well, how old is she?

23:15.561 --> 23:18.195
Eleven. And a half.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.231
Ahh...

23:20.266 --> 23:21.565
A tween.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.001
And, no.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.837
That's when boys
get on a girl's radar.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.973
Well, the way
she's explained it,

23:29.008 --> 23:32.009
it seems said boy
doesn't even know she exists,

23:32.044 --> 23:34.745
and she thinks it's because
she's not pretty enough.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.580
Not pretty enough?

23:36.616 --> 23:37.548
Yeah.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.383
I'm afraid I'm not much help.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.185
I've told her otherwise,
but...

23:41.220 --> 23:44.555
Tend to just embarrass her
more than anything.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.424
It's definitely
her mom's department.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.759
And her mom is--?

23:48.795 --> 23:50.828
We split up
when she was little.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.229
Amicable.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.231
We get along great.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.366
But she travels a lot,

23:55.401 --> 23:58.903
so kyra comes and stays with me
for long stretches.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.604
The principal at her school

24:00.640 --> 24:02.173
has worked with her mom and I
on the arrangement,

24:02.208 --> 24:05.109
so she does all her school work
via email and zoom.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.410
And of course,

24:06.446 --> 24:09.947
I give her an education up here
with our outdoor kids program.

24:09.982 --> 24:10.848
That sounds like

24:10.883 --> 24:13.217
an extraordinarily
awesome arrangement.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.418
Don't I know it.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.353
But this year
has been different,

24:16.389 --> 24:18.355
leaning on tough.

24:18.391 --> 24:19.390
[inhales sharply]

24:19.425 --> 24:20.424
like you said--

24:20.460 --> 24:23.427
she's entered
the twilight 'tween zone and...

24:23.463 --> 24:26.030
I'm a little lost with it.

24:26.065 --> 24:29.266
My advice, for what it's worth,

24:29.302 --> 24:31.135
just be there for her

24:31.170 --> 24:33.070
and listen.

24:35.441 --> 24:37.007
Hmm.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.744
[♪♪♪]

24:43.015 --> 24:45.783
[amy] whoo!
Careful up there, kyra.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.452
[amy grunts]

24:51.524 --> 24:52.556
wow.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.757
[♪♪♪]

24:53.793 --> 24:55.993
[mark] amy atwater,
meet little betsy.

24:56.028 --> 24:56.861
[amy chuckles]

24:56.896 --> 24:59.964
it's nice to meet you,
little betsy.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.567
So what can you tell me
about her?

25:03.603 --> 25:05.402
You're the tour guide.

25:05.438 --> 25:09.707
And you're the photographer
who captures personalities.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.077
Well, I'm gonna need a moment.

25:13.112 --> 25:16.146
It's all about the angle,
the right lighting...

25:16.182 --> 25:19.617
And it's all here,
so, there we go.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.785
Now we're talkin'.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.855
Hey, uh, kyra,
do you want to take some?

25:24.891 --> 25:26.590
No, it's okay.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.591
Oh.

25:27.627 --> 25:30.261
Okay.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.932
[♪♪♪]

25:39.005 --> 25:40.871
little betsy is proud,

25:40.907 --> 25:43.807
but sometimes
she feels resentful.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.343
She thinks

25:46.379 --> 25:47.344
that other people think

25:47.380 --> 25:51.615
that the larger waterfalls
are more majestic,

25:51.651 --> 25:54.218
but she doesn't know
how beautiful she is...

25:54.253 --> 25:56.921
Unique,
unlike any others.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.025
She's simply one of a kind.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.730
Hey, kyra,

26:06.766 --> 26:09.233
you know that picture you took
of the hummingbird?

26:09.268 --> 26:13.137
I submitted it with my photos
to the magazine.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.305
Really?

26:14.340 --> 26:16.874
Yep. I thought
it was the perfect match

26:16.909 --> 26:18.542
to go with
my waterfall pictures.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.778
Cool!

26:22.582 --> 26:23.847
So when did you know

26:23.883 --> 26:24.982
that you wanted to be
a photographer?

26:25.017 --> 26:27.651
Well, kind of started
as more of a hobby, you know,

26:27.687 --> 26:29.186
my grandparents, really,
just introduced me--

26:29.221 --> 26:30.521
dad, bear.

26:30.556 --> 26:33.190
Kyra, you know what to do.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.491
[♪♪♪]

26:34.527 --> 26:36.060
[overlapping]
get outta here, bear!

26:36.095 --> 26:37.761
-[mark] get outta here!
-[kyra] go away!

26:37.797 --> 26:40.197
-[amy screaming]
-take a hike! Go!

26:40.232 --> 26:41.832
[mark] get out!

26:41.867 --> 26:43.033
Ahh!

26:43.069 --> 26:44.234
Ahh-hh-hh!

26:44.270 --> 26:45.836
[shrieking]

26:45.871 --> 26:46.904
[bear grunts]

26:46.939 --> 26:48.606
[mark] ahh!

26:48.641 --> 26:49.740
Ahh!

26:51.310 --> 26:52.343
[normal voice] yeah.

26:52.378 --> 26:55.713
That is so awesome.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.582
I think I just peed my pants.

26:58.618 --> 27:01.619
Happens to the best of everyone
first time you see a bear.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.554
So, no bear spray?
That's all?

27:03.589 --> 27:04.421
You just scream

27:04.457 --> 27:06.590
and you throw your hands
up in the air?

27:06.626 --> 27:08.025
Well, it worked with that guy

27:08.060 --> 27:09.693
'cause there's three of us
and one of him,

27:09.729 --> 27:11.061
but if that was
a sow with her cubs,

27:11.097 --> 27:13.364
or a grizzly...

27:13.399 --> 27:16.066
Today, quite possibly,
would've been

27:16.102 --> 27:18.035
an entirely different
experience.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.903
To say the least.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.775
Hey, I didn't really
pee my pants.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.910
Yeah. Sure.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.379
[kyra]
one of his bad dad jokes.

27:32.018 --> 27:35.085
Well, I just wanna make sure
that you know...

27:37.256 --> 27:41.091
Oh! Finally! We made it.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.460
So, how much do I owe you?

27:43.496 --> 27:45.095
Consider it a favor.

27:45.131 --> 27:48.766
I can't do that.
This is your day off, remember?

27:48.801 --> 27:51.602
This is what I like to do
on my day off, remember?

27:53.305 --> 27:54.938
So, where are you
going to take me next?

27:54.974 --> 27:57.241
Redwood falls?

27:57.276 --> 27:59.610
[chuckles]
right after the unicorn hunt.

27:59.645 --> 28:01.945
Okay, sign me up.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.348
Honestly, though,
thank you.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.416
Again.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.417
You're welcome.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.852
Again.

28:08.888 --> 28:09.753
Hey.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.089
There's a social tonight
at the bonfire.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.158
You should come.
It's fun.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.292
Usually some interesting people.

28:15.327 --> 28:18.595
Well, I'm-I'm not very good
with people I don't know,

28:18.631 --> 28:20.130
even interesting ones.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.501
Well, you know us,

28:24.537 --> 28:26.203
and we're interesting.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.806
Very true.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.841
And we'll go if you go.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.478
Well, then it's a done deal.

28:34.513 --> 28:35.446
I'll see you then?

28:35.481 --> 28:37.381
See you then.
[laughs]

28:37.416 --> 28:38.716
okay.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.451
See, I told you
she would come.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.352
Yeah, yeah, okay.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.857
-It could work.
-I think so, yeah.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.460
[indistinct chatter]

28:49.495 --> 28:52.062
whoa, who is that?

28:52.098 --> 28:53.430
[mark, reproachfully] easy!

28:53.466 --> 28:56.033
Why do I get a feeling
you already know her?

28:56.068 --> 28:57.067
Who is she?

28:57.103 --> 28:58.135
Damsel in distress.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.104
Helped her out,
lost on a trail.

29:00.139 --> 29:03.307
Well, she certainly
doesn't look distressed now.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.408
All right, all right,
pipe down.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.409
Hi.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.543
Hey there.

29:06.579 --> 29:08.545
You look, uh...

29:08.581 --> 29:09.646
Really nice.

29:09.682 --> 29:11.548
Oh, thank you.

29:12.685 --> 29:13.817
Hi. I'm peter.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.552
-Hi!
-My apologies.

29:15.588 --> 29:16.987
This is my friend, peter.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.322
Peter, amy atwater.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.157
Charmed.

29:20.192 --> 29:20.924
[smooch]

29:20.960 --> 29:23.894
kiss of the hand--
old-school.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.963
Oh, I also still like
to open a door for a lady,

29:25.998 --> 29:27.765
walk on the outside
of the sidewalk,

29:27.800 --> 29:30.167
and like to offer to pick up
the check on the first date.

29:30.202 --> 29:33.937
Well, as female-forward
as I consider myself to be,

29:33.973 --> 29:36.006
I quite enjoy
all three gestures.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.107
I hope you are taking
notes, mark.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.909
[chuckles awkwardly]

29:38.944 --> 29:40.944
-very nice to meet you, amy.
-Nice to meet you, too.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.747
Our resident charming
mr. Debonair.

29:43.783 --> 29:44.748
[laughing]

29:44.784 --> 29:46.283
beer delivery!

29:46.318 --> 29:47.651
Get 'em
while they are cold.

29:47.686 --> 29:48.952
You didn't have to do that.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.954
Except that I wanted to.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.358
Oh, amy, this is tara.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.692
Tara, amy.

29:55.728 --> 29:56.660
Hi.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.028
Tara's also a tour guide here.

29:58.063 --> 30:00.364
Right. I, uh,
remember hearing the name.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.231
You were fully booked.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.801
What can I say?
I'm in high demand.

30:03.836 --> 30:06.336
So, uh, is kyra here?

30:06.372 --> 30:08.472
Yeah, she's over there,

30:08.507 --> 30:11.141
doing her best impression
of a wall mural.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.544
Well, I'm, uh, gonna go say hi,

30:13.579 --> 30:15.546
but it was nice
to meet you, tara.

30:15.581 --> 30:16.980
And so nice to meet you, too.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.016
I'll come find you
in a bit.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.951
Uh, sounds good. Yeah.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.323
[♪♪♪]

30:26.358 --> 30:27.891
hey, kyra.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.226
Amy.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.727
Hi.

30:30.763 --> 30:32.796
So... Is he here?

30:32.832 --> 30:34.198
Who?

30:34.233 --> 30:36.300
I was once an 11-year-old girl,

30:36.335 --> 30:37.701
and it seems to me

30:37.736 --> 30:40.237
like you're looking
for someone in particular.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.606
Just this boy
I've met here.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.375
Hey, kyra.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.377
Hi, hunter.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.249
Taking that's him?

30:52.284 --> 30:53.550
Yeah.

30:53.586 --> 30:55.886
That was pretty nice of him
to say hi.

30:55.921 --> 30:57.754
But he didn't come over
and talk.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.256
True.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.991
Took a lot of courage for him
to say hello to you,

31:01.026 --> 31:01.925
don't you think?

31:01.961 --> 31:03.994
I guess.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.496
Why don't you go
talk to him?

31:06.532 --> 31:08.065
[kyra] uh, no way.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.401
Ask him if he wants, like,
a soda or a lemonade.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.836
I can't.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.938
Do you like him?

31:14.974 --> 31:16.073
Sort of.

31:17.576 --> 31:18.742
Okay, yes.

31:18.777 --> 31:21.111
Then you need to go over there

31:21.146 --> 31:22.846
and tell him you wanna
be friends with him.

31:22.882 --> 31:23.981
Hang out.

31:24.016 --> 31:28.585
And the only way to do that
is to go on over there.

31:28.621 --> 31:31.188
It might not seem like it
at your age,

31:31.223 --> 31:32.256
but life is too short

31:32.291 --> 31:34.758
to let these moments
pass you by.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.693
Will you come with me?

31:36.729 --> 31:38.862
Sure, I will.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.497
[nervously] okay.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.669
[♪♪♪]

31:46.906 --> 31:49.273
[kyra] hey, um... Hunter?

31:49.308 --> 31:50.374
Yes?

31:50.409 --> 31:52.910
Well, um, I was wondering

31:52.945 --> 31:55.279
if you wanted to go, um, maybe--

31:55.314 --> 31:56.747
hey, hunter! Are you coming?

31:56.782 --> 31:59.216
We're gonna go check out
the new dock.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.550
Want to come?

32:00.586 --> 32:01.919
[girl] hunter, come on!

32:01.954 --> 32:04.421
Um, no thanks.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.623
Okay. Well, bye.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.526
[softly] bye.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.999
He asked you to go with him
to see the dock.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.134
Means nothing.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.235
[amy] hey...

32:18.270 --> 32:21.004
I know a few things about boys,

32:21.040 --> 32:23.907
and he seems
to be pretty interested.

32:26.211 --> 32:29.012
I'm gonna go get some lemonade.
Do you want any?

32:29.048 --> 32:30.447
Sure. Thanks.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.581
-Hi, dad.
-Hey.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.619
-She okay?
-I think so.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.921
I rarely trust
my own instincts,

32:37.957 --> 32:39.690
and I'm asking her
to take my advice.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.191
At this stage,

32:41.226 --> 32:43.226
I'm guessing
it's better than mine.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.430
I'm sure
you get told this a lot,

32:46.465 --> 32:48.832
but she's a pretty awesome kid.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.034
Looks like
the feeling's mutual.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.703
I can tell
she likes you a lot, too.

32:52.738 --> 32:53.971
You can?

32:54.006 --> 32:56.239
Yeah. I mean,
what's not to like?

32:57.743 --> 32:58.775
Hey, uh...

32:58.811 --> 33:00.010
I have a group hitting up

33:00.045 --> 33:02.212
one of the more difficult-to-
get-to waterfalls tomorrow.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.213
Interested?

33:03.248 --> 33:04.781
Of course.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.383
Do you like heights?

33:06.418 --> 33:09.353
Only if I'm attached
to something.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.656
[♪♪♪]

33:15.861 --> 33:17.394
I don't think I can do this.

33:17.429 --> 33:18.695
Yes, you can.

33:18.731 --> 33:20.630
-It's easy.
-You're 11!

33:20.666 --> 33:23.633
"I know it doesn't seem like it
at your age, but...

33:23.669 --> 33:26.136
Life's too short to let
these moments pass you by."

33:26.171 --> 33:26.970
whoo-hoo!

33:27.006 --> 33:29.072
Holy cow...

33:29.108 --> 33:30.173
See? It's easy!

33:30.209 --> 33:31.541
[mark] you don't have to jump

33:31.577 --> 33:33.210
like supergirl there--
just take it slow.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.845
One little bounce at a time.

33:34.880 --> 33:35.812
You'll be totally secure.

33:35.848 --> 33:39.082
What if I accidentally
let go of the rope?

33:39.118 --> 33:40.484
-Definitely don't do that.
-Okay.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.419
[exhales deeply]

33:42.454 --> 33:44.421
hi. Rest of my group
get down safe?

33:44.456 --> 33:46.423
Yep. All safe.

33:46.458 --> 33:47.424
How's it going?

33:47.459 --> 33:48.725
Great.

33:48.761 --> 33:49.760
You nervous?

33:49.795 --> 33:50.627
Yeah!

33:50.662 --> 33:52.729
Yeah, well,
that's what makes it fun.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.865
See you at the bottom.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.166
Oh!

33:56.201 --> 33:58.702
Ohh... [panicking]

34:00.439 --> 34:01.738
okay, just ignore them.

34:01.774 --> 34:03.840
Go at your own pace.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.475
Push out. Legs out.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.679
I-I can't do this.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.416
Hey! You said as long as
you were attached to something.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.351
I meant like a building.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.887
Come on, conquer your fears.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.288
That's what I watch
horror movies for.

34:18.323 --> 34:20.457
Do you want to see
falcon falls or not?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.592
[exhales darkly]

34:22.628 --> 34:24.294
right.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.430
Okay.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.066
Yeah.

34:32.171 --> 34:33.804
[carabiner rattling]

34:33.839 --> 34:35.038
you'll be fine.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.907
-[chuckles dubiously]
-okay?

34:36.942 --> 34:38.542
All right.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.544
[kyra] you got this, amy!

34:44.750 --> 34:45.982
[amy exhales with resolve]

34:46.018 --> 34:47.384
on the count of three.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.618
One...

34:48.654 --> 34:50.287
Two...

34:50.322 --> 34:51.988
...Three!

34:52.024 --> 34:54.057
[♪♪♪]

34:54.093 --> 34:55.926
[yelling] I'm doing it!

34:57.696 --> 35:01.465
Whoo! Yeah!

35:02.868 --> 35:05.669
Whoo! Go, amy!
You got this! Come on, amy!

35:05.704 --> 35:08.738
Whoo!

35:10.876 --> 35:12.576
Whoo!

35:14.313 --> 35:15.212
Great job!

35:15.247 --> 35:16.346
Are you sure you've never
done that before?

35:16.381 --> 35:17.614
I swear!

35:17.649 --> 35:18.648
[amy pants]

35:18.684 --> 35:20.684
that was incredible!

35:20.719 --> 35:21.818
I couldn't have
done it on my own.

35:21.854 --> 35:24.421
There are a lot a people
who never go through with it.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.689
-I'm proud of you.
-Yeah?

35:25.724 --> 35:27.657
Thanks.
I'm proud of me, too.

35:29.394 --> 35:31.027
Uh, so we should probably
keep moving.

35:31.063 --> 35:32.762
We've still a big hike
ahead of us.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.499
[amy, quietly]
that was so exhilarating.

35:35.534 --> 35:36.967
That feeling doesn't go away,

35:37.002 --> 35:38.435
no matter how many times
I do it.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.704
I feel like I just conquered
the grim reaper.

35:40.739 --> 35:43.807
You conquered
the climb to falcon falls.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.942
Welcome
to the rest of your life.

35:47.679 --> 35:48.778
Yes!

35:48.814 --> 35:50.981
[♪♪♪]

35:58.824 --> 36:01.458
[amy] every one
seems to make me awestruck.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.226
It's like the harder
they are to get to,

36:03.262 --> 36:04.728
the more they preen.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.796
Yeah.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.333
So what's your take
on mr. Falcon here?

36:10.369 --> 36:14.504
[amy] the water cascades
differently than the other ones.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.641
And the rocks
are a lot smoother,

36:17.676 --> 36:21.978
and it feels like a cave
among an enchanted forest

36:22.014 --> 36:24.181
with a waterfall.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.348
[chuckles]

36:25.384 --> 36:27.017
he's smooth talker, this one.

36:27.052 --> 36:30.053
Maybe even a little bit cocky.

36:30.088 --> 36:31.655
All that from a photograph?

36:31.690 --> 36:32.789
Oh, well,

36:32.824 --> 36:36.092
the right photograph
can reveal a lot about someone.

36:36.128 --> 36:38.562
Remind me never to let you
take photos of me.

36:39.798 --> 36:40.730
[snap]

36:43.635 --> 36:45.001
what?

36:45.037 --> 36:46.403
Oh, nothing.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.837
Hey, come on.
Let me see it.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.406
That's not fair.

36:49.441 --> 36:53.043
Okay, fine. Here you go.

36:53.078 --> 36:55.045
Do you think
I need to shave?

36:55.080 --> 36:57.347
[laughs]
no, I like the scruff.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.020
We better
catch up with the others.

37:04.056 --> 37:04.854
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.756
Mm-hmm.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.026
Okay.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.565
[♪♪♪]

37:24.042 --> 37:25.508
[camilla]
<i> it's excellent work, amy.</i>

37:25.544 --> 37:26.776
<i> I told you</i>
<i> I'm not easily pleased,</i>

37:26.812 --> 37:28.778
<i> but you're doing</i>
<i> a fantastic job.</i>

37:28.814 --> 37:30.146
Thank you.

37:30.182 --> 37:32.582
<i> However, these waterfalls</i>
<i> have been published before.</i>

37:32.618 --> 37:34.184
You know
what I'm looking for.

37:34.219 --> 37:36.052
I'm working on it.

37:36.088 --> 37:39.189
<i> Good, because we are expanding</i>
<i> this into a much bigger story.</i>

37:39.224 --> 37:41.458
"mythical waterfalls revealed."

37:41.493 --> 37:44.961
well, I have good source
that says they don't exist.

37:44.997 --> 37:46.863
<i> That's because</i>
<i> they think they own them.</i>

37:46.898 --> 37:48.298
But they don't.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.400
Once you prove
that they do exist,

37:50.435 --> 37:51.901
<i> you'll share in the rewards.</i>

37:51.937 --> 37:54.571
I like the sounds of that.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.406
<i> I'm also setting up</i>
<i> a new assignment for you.</i>

37:56.441 --> 37:57.407
<i> Santa fe.</i>

37:57.442 --> 37:59.709
Seriously?

37:59.745 --> 38:01.411
You've got three days
to get this one done.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.546
Count on it.

38:04.816 --> 38:07.884
Camilla, one of the photographs
I sent you--

38:07.919 --> 38:09.219
the one of the hummingbird--

38:09.254 --> 38:10.253
<i> yes. Love it.</i>

38:10.289 --> 38:12.055
I always like
a few complementary photographs

38:12.090 --> 38:13.923
to go with the main subject.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.225
I didn't actually take that one

38:15.260 --> 38:16.760
and I want to make sure

38:46.291 --> 38:48.958
So, angel and redwood falls,

38:48.994 --> 38:51.461
I've been trying
to get the scoop,

38:51.496 --> 38:52.962
but it's been tough.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.964
Okay, so here's the deal--

38:55.000 --> 38:57.667
redwood falls is, like,
top-notch secret up here.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.302
It's like no one talks about it,

38:59.338 --> 39:00.770
so it's a little difficult
to gauge

39:00.806 --> 39:02.272
who has actually seen it.

39:02.307 --> 39:03.473
Really?

39:03.508 --> 39:05.041
Yeah, but if I was
a betting man,

39:05.077 --> 39:06.309
which I'm not,

39:06.345 --> 39:08.044
but if I was,

39:08.080 --> 39:09.979
I'd say there's only one person
who works here

39:10.015 --> 39:11.348

39:35.507 --> 39:36.706
You don't seem very impressed.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.009
I am. In fact...

39:40.045 --> 39:42.312
It's inspiring.

Actually... Not really.

Oh.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.221
I'm just being honest, sorry.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.356
No, no. I-I like honest.

39:53.392 --> 39:56.659
How is that "inspiring"?

39:56.695 --> 39:58.862
Well, this one,

39:58.897 --> 40:01.831
I haven't seen
this waterfall before.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.169
Protecting
our treasures around here

40:06.204 --> 40:08.538
is not something
we joke about.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.340
I'll be sure to remember that
when you take me there.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.510

about the photographs.

in these portraits.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.290
Hmm.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.959
Yeah, I kind of agree.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.529
Angel falls is unlike
any of the others.

<i> This</i> is angel falls?

40:34.800 --> 40:35.732

I've heard it's as elusive
as redwood falls.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.804
Not quite.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.973
As you can see, it does exist.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.875
It is rare.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.877
And spectacular.

40:47.913 --> 40:50.280
And very hard to get to.

Can you take me there?

Please.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.058
Well...

41:02.093 --> 41:05.495
I do think she deserves
a better portrait than that.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.764
And you are
a much better photographer,

41:07.799 --> 41:09.332

to our local artist.

All right.

41:12.471 --> 41:13.336
Under one condition.

41:13.371 --> 41:15.672
That I don't tell anyone
how I found it?

41:15.707 --> 41:17.240
That too.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.642
There's a crescent moon
this evening,

41:19.678 --> 41:21.978

41:22.013 --> 41:24.848
Shines an awesome hue of orange,
like you've never seen before.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.616
Another tradition around here--

41:26.651 --> 41:28.351
you have to swear
the oath of honor.

that effect on people.

a little longer.

Actually, I don't know
how I feel about it.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.679
Why?

42:29.714 --> 42:32.081
I'm getting paid
to take photos,

42:32.117 --> 42:33.683
and that's my passion,

42:33.718 --> 42:37.186
and I'm grateful for that.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.088
But?

42:39.124 --> 42:42.692
Being at that gallery,
if I'm gonna be honest,

42:42.727 --> 42:44.827
that is what I would love to do.

42:44.863 --> 42:47.196
I know I wouldn't
make a lot of money,

42:47.232 --> 42:49.198
but I could be my own artist,

42:49.234 --> 42:51.100
and that's what inspired me.

42:51.136 --> 42:52.769
Then you should do it.

And I'm not kidding--
you are way better.

42:55.540 --> 42:57.607
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

42:57.642 --> 42:59.442
Start by taking
a leap of faith.

Just like going down
the face of that rock.

43:02.714 --> 43:04.781

you were my safety net.

than I could spend.

to ask you this, mark.

I've gotta know.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.256
It does.

44:20.291 --> 44:23.593
Redwood falls exists?

44:23.628 --> 44:26.429
I'm one of the few people
to have ever found it.

44:26.464 --> 44:27.997
It was by accident,

44:28.033 --> 44:31.200
I was just out
exploring south of angel falls,

44:31.236 --> 44:33.670
actually thought I was lost
for a little while.

44:33.705 --> 44:35.938
And then I saw
this strange rock--

44:35.974 --> 44:37.774
well...

44:37.809 --> 44:40.943
It was more like two of them,
twisted together.

44:40.979 --> 44:43.212
One of the old-timers
calls it "twisted sister".

44:43.248 --> 44:45.148
[laughs]

44:45.183 --> 44:47.817
so, I had heard from a friend,

44:47.852 --> 44:49.886
who had heard
from his grandfather,

44:49.921 --> 44:52.488
who had heard
from his grandmother,

44:52.524 --> 44:57.293
that if you follow your compass
at 212 degrees from that rock,

44:57.328 --> 44:59.128
redwood falls
isn't far from there.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.732
That number always
stuck in my mind

45:02.767 --> 45:05.368
because
it's the exact temperature--

45:05.403 --> 45:06.736
...That water boils.

45:06.771 --> 45:07.804
Exactly.

45:09.607 --> 45:11.574
I've found that nature
has a funny sense of humor.

45:11.609 --> 45:13.476
Anyway,
I followed that direction,

45:13.511 --> 45:15.011
and there it was.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.579
Along with the unicorns.

45:16.614 --> 45:18.347
That's right.

45:18.383 --> 45:21.884
I didn't mean to pretend
I hadn't been there, but...

45:23.121 --> 45:26.255
A place like that
is just legendary.

45:26.291 --> 45:27.724
Legendary?

45:27.759 --> 45:29.559
Yeah, it's hard to explain.

45:29.594 --> 45:31.728
Both angel and redwood are.

45:31.763 --> 45:33.863
Words don't do justice

45:33.898 --> 45:35.031
to describe
either of those falls.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.899
Are you gonna take me there?

45:36.935 --> 45:38.901
To angel falls, as agreed.

45:38.937 --> 45:41.537
Redwood
is a whole other exploration,

45:41.573 --> 45:43.206

45:43.241 --> 45:46.876
I don't even know
if I'd be able to find it again.

45:46.911 --> 45:50.012
I don't know whether
you're telling me the truth,

45:50.048 --> 45:53.049
but I'm gonna go with it,

45:53.084 --> 45:55.251
so, angel falls.

And only after
you've sworn an oath.

1:09:03.773 --> 1:09:05.006
I like it.

1:09:05.041 --> 1:09:06.474
The photos are amazing.

1:09:06.510 --> 1:09:08.042
She's very talented.

1:09:08.078 --> 1:09:10.145
She didn't geotag this image,
though.

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:11.713
What do you mean?

1:09:11.748 --> 1:09:14.215
Well, I want our readers
to know the location.

1:09:14.251 --> 1:09:15.984
That's one of the main reasons
they come to our magazine,

1:09:16.019 --> 1:09:18.419
is that they can explore
what they read about.

1:09:18.455 --> 1:09:20.021
Unless she didn't turn
the satellite off on her camera,

1:09:20.056 --> 1:09:21.523
it's still imbedded in the file.

1:09:21.558 --> 1:09:22.724
So you can find it?

1:09:22.759 --> 1:09:24.225
Sure.

1:09:24.261 --> 1:09:25.760
Good. I want that
in the article.

1:09:25.795 --> 1:09:26.861
But the whole point
of the article

1:09:26.897 --> 1:09:29.097
is that only a few people
know where angel falls is.

1:09:29.132 --> 1:09:30.698
They swear an oath
not to reveal its location.

1:09:30.734 --> 1:09:32.100
She told us that.

1:09:32.135 --> 1:09:35.203
She did,
but I never swore an oath.

1:09:35.238 --> 1:09:36.905
So, do it.

1:09:36.940 --> 1:09:39.440
Camilla.
Amy gave her word.

1:09:39.476 --> 1:09:41.209
I really don't think
you should do this

1:09:41.244 --> 1:09:42.911
without talking to her first.

1:09:42.946 --> 1:09:44.946
Those waterfalls don't belong

1:09:44.981 --> 1:09:46.347
to just the people
that live there, penny.

1:09:46.383 --> 1:09:48.016
They belong to the world.

1:09:48.051 --> 1:09:50.518
But isn't the mystery
of this particular waterfall--

1:09:50.554 --> 1:09:53.254
the fact that this is one of
the few photographs ever taken?

1:09:53.290 --> 1:09:54.155
Isn't that what's gonna

1:09:54.191 --> 1:09:56.257
keep people coming back
to this article?

1:09:56.293 --> 1:09:57.926
Isn't that more valuable?

1:09:59.796 --> 1:10:02.130
Okay, uh, maybe you're right.

1:10:02.165 --> 1:10:04.299
Leave it.
Let's create a buzz.

1:10:04.334 --> 1:10:06.434
Maybe that will
draw in more clicks.

I've gotten to know her.

1:10:35.365 --> 1:10:36.664
It must be a mistake.

1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:38.233
She wouldn't
do it intentionally.

1:10:38.268 --> 1:10:41.603
Yeah, well, I'm gonna agree
to disagree, okay?

1:10:44.007 --> 1:10:45.807
Hey!

1:10:45.842 --> 1:10:48.042
Tara. Is, uh, mark here yet?

1:10:48.078 --> 1:10:50.311
How could you do that?

1:10:50.347 --> 1:10:51.813
-Do what?
-Oh, come on.

1:10:51.848 --> 1:10:53.748
You were playing him
the whole time.

1:10:53.783 --> 1:10:55.650
"playing him"?

1:10:55.685 --> 1:10:57.986
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:10:58.021 --> 1:10:59.487
No? Did you read the article?

1:10:59.522 --> 1:11:00.989
Yeah...

1:11:01.024 --> 1:11:03.024
It was sacred ground, amy.

1:11:03.059 --> 1:11:04.525
You swore an oath!

I-I'm totally lost.

read the whole thing?

Hey, I had no idea!

1:11:41.898 --> 1:11:44.198
Your camera has geotagging,
I heard you tell kyra.

1:11:44.234 --> 1:11:45.066
Yeah, but I--

1:11:45.101 --> 1:11:46.701
it never occurred to me
at the time.

1:11:46.736 --> 1:11:48.236
Yeah, but I--
I turned it off.

1:11:48.271 --> 1:11:49.771
Apparently not.

1:11:49.806 --> 1:11:50.938
Do you understand
what you've done?

1:11:50.974 --> 1:11:53.541
This isn't like someone pointing
in the general direction.

1:11:53.576 --> 1:11:55.543
It's the exact
latitude and longitude.

1:11:55.578 --> 1:11:57.812

1:12:04.087 --> 1:12:05.153

1:12:05.188 --> 1:12:06.821
Because,
from where I'm standing,

1:12:06.856 --> 1:12:08.656
it seems like this is what
you intended all along.

1:12:08.692 --> 1:12:10.825
That's not true.

1:12:10.860 --> 1:12:12.293
You need to understand
something.

1:12:12.329 --> 1:12:15.596
Okay? This isn't about us
keeping it to ourselves.
