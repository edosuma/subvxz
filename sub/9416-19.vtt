00:08.700 --> 00:11.903
- These pancakes taste funny.
- What do you mean?

00:11.954 --> 00:12.987
They're good.

00:15.207 --> 00:16.824
- Hey.
- Oh!

00:16.858 --> 00:19.043
Mom made good pancakes!

00:20.295 --> 00:24.048
Is up down? Is black white? Is Dad smart?

00:26.135 --> 00:28.920
How do you go from
"Mom made good pancakes"

00:28.971 --> 00:32.055
- to making fun of me?
- 14 years of practice.

00:33.225 --> 00:35.927
- Mom, what happened?
- Well, I got tired

00:35.978 --> 00:38.062
of you guys making fun of my pancakes.

00:38.096 --> 00:40.898
So I got up early,
made them from scratch.

00:40.933 --> 00:43.901
And now I expect the jokes to stop.

00:45.053 --> 00:46.270
All right, guys, see you later.

00:46.321 --> 00:48.990
I'm heading over to Ivy's
to help her pack for college.

00:49.024 --> 00:51.993
Oh, that's nice. Why don't you
have some breakfast before you go?

00:52.027 --> 00:55.947
Mom made delicious pancakes.

00:55.998 --> 00:56.998
No, seriously.

00:59.168 --> 01:01.035
These are amazing.

01:02.287 --> 01:05.906
So you learn how to cook just
as I'm heading off to college?

01:05.924 --> 01:10.011
Okay, Teddy, we agreed, we're not
making any more of those jokes.

01:10.045 --> 01:11.879
Oh, we didn't agree on anything.

01:11.913 --> 01:14.081
We're taking the jokes
one meal at a time.

01:14.099 --> 01:17.051
- P.J., could you help me in the living room for a sec?
- Sure.

01:22.191 --> 01:24.925
- Thanks for making the pancakes.
- Mm-hmm.

02:22.648 --> 02:26.368
- Come in.
- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Wentz.

02:26.419 --> 02:29.788
Welcome to our happy home.

02:29.822 --> 02:31.456
What's wrong?

02:31.490 --> 02:33.759
Our baby girl's going off to college.

02:33.793 --> 02:37.379
- Yeah, we're all heartbroken.
- Hey hey hey!

02:39.498 --> 02:41.550
Well, one heart looks intact.

02:43.502 --> 02:46.688
Ivy, I can't believe you'll
soon be 800 Miles away.

02:46.722 --> 02:49.474
Mmm, 854.

02:49.508 --> 02:51.676
Which is a long way to go for a visit.

02:51.694 --> 02:55.530
- But only two hours by plane.
- Yeah, but Mom gets airsick.

02:56.682 --> 02:59.350
Ivy, cheer down.

02:59.368 --> 03:02.821
I'm gonna go get more boxes
out of the garage.

03:05.458 --> 03:08.326
You know, my parents are sad
I'm going off to college too.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.661
But it's not the same.

03:09.695 --> 03:12.497
You've got so many kids
at home, when one leaves,

03:12.531 --> 03:14.633
it barely makes a dent.

03:17.369 --> 03:19.421
I just don't know what
I'm going to do without her.

03:19.472 --> 03:22.757
Well, you'll have more time
to follow the weather!

03:22.809 --> 03:25.343
Oh, Teddy, how can I enjoy the weather

03:25.377 --> 03:28.346
when there's a dark cloud
over my heart?

03:28.380 --> 03:31.733
Oh, Harry, even in distress, you're poetic.

03:33.436 --> 03:36.738
Come on, guys,
where's that ol' wentz fire?

03:36.772 --> 03:38.773
Hey, I know.

03:38.825 --> 03:41.726
How about a couple verses
of "row row row your boat"?

03:41.744 --> 03:46.414
- That always lifts your spirits.
- Well, it's worth a try.

03:46.449 --> 03:47.499
Okay.

03:50.419 --> 03:53.538
♪ Row row row your boat

03:53.572 --> 03:56.708
♪ gently down the stream...

03:59.578 --> 04:01.630
It's not as jaunty as I remembered it.

04:01.681 --> 04:05.583
Guys, look, I know that it's hard,

04:05.601 --> 04:08.603
but what choice do you have? I
mean, what are you going to do,

04:08.638 --> 04:12.423
- move to Arizona with her?
- I guess you're right.

04:12.441 --> 04:15.477
Now just try to cheer up,
for Ivy's sake.

04:15.528 --> 04:18.762
Believe me, she is a lot
more upset than she seems.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.616
Ha ha! Great news!

04:21.651 --> 04:23.485
I just checked with the airline,

04:23.536 --> 04:26.705
and I can fly
stand-by tonight!

04:26.739 --> 04:28.323
Whoo!

04:33.612 --> 04:36.298
Charlie, honey, you ready
for your playdate?

04:36.332 --> 04:38.449
- Yay!
- Who's coming over?

04:38.467 --> 04:40.719
Taylor.
I invited her parents too.

04:40.753 --> 04:42.620
So we're all having a playdate?

04:42.638 --> 04:44.673
Bob, honey, this one is
actually going to be fun.

04:44.724 --> 04:46.758
I met the Mom, Susan,
she's really nice.

04:46.792 --> 04:50.345
Oh, I met her.
I thought her name was Cheryl.

04:50.396 --> 04:52.397
- No, it's Susan.
- Are you sure?

04:52.431 --> 04:54.349
Am I sure that I'm right
and you're wrong?

04:54.400 --> 04:56.801
<i>Always.</i>

04:56.819 --> 04:58.570
Okay, that must be them.

05:02.474 --> 05:04.326
Hi!

05:04.360 --> 05:05.410
Taylor!

05:08.531 --> 05:10.648
- Hi, Susan!
- Hi!

05:10.666 --> 05:13.285
Amy, this is Taylor's
other Mom Cheryl.

05:13.319 --> 05:14.336
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

05:14.370 --> 05:16.371
- This is my husband Bob.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

05:16.422 --> 05:17.756
Come on in.
Come on in.

05:22.345 --> 05:24.462
Taylor has two Moms.

05:24.496 --> 05:27.498
Wow, nothing gets past you, Bob.

05:33.689 --> 05:36.507
I'll tell you why you don't
have a girlfriend, Jake.

05:36.525 --> 05:41.479
It's because you say things like, "look
how silky and manageable my hair is."

05:44.350 --> 05:47.535
That's weird. A banana
peel just fell on me.

05:47.570 --> 05:50.622
No, we don't have a monkey.

05:50.656 --> 05:52.574
I'll call you later.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.709
Hello?

05:54.744 --> 05:57.579
Is someone in the tree house?

06:17.683 --> 06:21.569
Whoever you are, I have a plastic bat!

06:21.604 --> 06:23.571
Ahh, I shouldn't have said plastic.

06:26.776 --> 06:28.393
P.J.?

06:28.411 --> 06:30.561
Hey!

06:30.579 --> 06:32.664
How'd you know it was me?

06:32.698 --> 06:34.699
Who else would break
into our tree house

06:34.733 --> 06:37.535
and put up a gurgles poster?

06:37.569 --> 06:39.737
The fan club has over 38,000 members.

06:39.755 --> 06:42.740
- If you factor in international...
- Don't need to know that.

06:42.758 --> 06:45.410
What are you doing here?

06:45.428 --> 06:46.744
I'm living here.

06:46.762 --> 06:48.713
- What, why?
- Because...

06:48.747 --> 06:52.300
Emmett and I couldn't pay our rent
so we got kicked out of our apartment.

06:52.351 --> 06:54.519
- Man.
- This is just temporary.

06:54.553 --> 06:56.438
Okay? Please don't tell Mom and Dad.

06:56.472 --> 06:58.723
Well, normally I'd blackmail you,

06:58.757 --> 07:02.310
but what I'm hearing is you're
out of money, so I'm at a loss.

07:03.396 --> 07:05.430
Sorry to put you in that position.

07:05.448 --> 07:07.615
Well, since you're living here,

07:07.650 --> 07:10.452
why don't you fix
this place up a little bit?

07:10.486 --> 07:13.271
I don't know, I'd hate to
steal focus from the poster.

07:15.624 --> 07:18.543
Come on, there's a house
down there full of stuff.

07:18.577 --> 07:20.745
A couple of chairs, a throw pillow,

07:20.779 --> 07:23.331
we'll really make this place
feel like home.

07:23.382 --> 07:26.451
- You're a good brother.
- I just want to see you get back on your feet again.

07:26.469 --> 07:28.503
And then I'll blackmail you.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.728
- So, Bob, what do you do?
- I'm an exterminator.

07:40.632 --> 07:44.402
Yeah, that usually ends
the conversation.

07:45.738 --> 07:48.656
- What do you two do?
- I'm a lawyer.

07:48.691 --> 07:51.526
Yeah, that's killed
its share of conversations too.

07:52.578 --> 07:54.496
I work from home
so I can be with Taylor.

07:54.530 --> 07:57.449
- I'm a graphic designer.
- Graphic design!

07:57.483 --> 07:59.367
I love that stuff.

08:00.619 --> 08:02.704
Yeah, the designs can be very...

08:04.757 --> 08:07.325
Graphic.

08:07.343 --> 08:09.511
Okay, the girls are upstairs,
having a blast.

08:09.545 --> 08:12.263
- Bob, you want to help me in the kitchen?
- Yeah, sure thing.

08:14.717 --> 08:16.667
- They seem nice.
- I know, right?

08:16.685 --> 08:19.387
- Great couple.
- Um...

08:19.438 --> 08:20.688
- Just one question.
- Hmm?

08:20.723 --> 08:22.673
Usually on these playdates

08:22.691 --> 08:25.527
I go downstairs with the Dad
to watch the game.

08:25.561 --> 08:29.697
So who... who am I going
to watch the game with now?

08:31.517 --> 08:33.518
I don't want to make any assumptions.

08:33.535 --> 08:35.736
- Do you want me to ask them?
- No no no.

08:35.788 --> 08:38.456
You know what?
I'll figure it out.

08:38.491 --> 08:40.741
I can be pretty smooth.

08:45.381 --> 08:47.582
This isn't going
to be pretty or smooth.

08:49.418 --> 08:51.586
Okay, here we go.

08:51.637 --> 08:55.723
Uh, so I was thinking
about heading downstairs

08:55.758 --> 08:58.476
and watching the rookies
game, if anyone's interested.

08:58.511 --> 09:00.428
Okay if you are, okay if you're not.

09:02.815 --> 09:05.383
Well, I'm not a huge baseball fan,

09:05.401 --> 09:07.685
- but I'll watch it with you.
- Fantastic.

09:07.719 --> 09:09.354
Susan's gonna watch the game!

09:09.388 --> 09:12.390
I'm gonna watch the game.
No assumptions were made

09:12.408 --> 09:14.725
and it all went very smoothly.

09:16.495 --> 09:18.496
Susan, shall we?

09:18.531 --> 09:20.281
Okay.

09:24.370 --> 09:26.371
His first time with
two Moms? - Uh-huh.

09:40.469 --> 09:43.521
Boy, things sure
have changed down here.

09:43.556 --> 09:46.441
Oh, yeah.
We're in a good mood now.

09:46.475 --> 09:50.278
And no language says
happy like German.

09:50.312 --> 09:52.480
So why the big turnaround?

09:52.531 --> 09:54.616
We have some exciting news.

09:54.650 --> 09:58.369
We decided that if our little
girl is going to Arizona,

09:58.404 --> 10:01.656
- we're going with her.
- What?!

10:03.576 --> 10:05.493
And it was all Teddy's idea.

10:05.544 --> 10:06.494
What?!

10:15.000 --> 10:17.919
So then we realized there's
nothing holding us here.

10:17.953 --> 10:20.788
So why not sell the house,
pack up the r. V.

10:20.822 --> 10:22.990
And move to Arizona to be
with our little girl?

10:23.008 --> 10:25.710
Mm-hmm. And we never
would've thought of it

10:25.761 --> 10:28.880
if Teddy hadn't said, "why
don't you just move to Arizona?"

10:30.966 --> 10:32.884
C'mon, honey, it's our turn to get boxes.

10:32.935 --> 10:33.885
Woo-hoo!

10:39.141 --> 10:41.943
What did you do?

10:41.977 --> 10:44.946
Not what I was trying to do,
I'll tell you that.

10:46.215 --> 10:48.733
T, do you know

10:48.784 --> 10:51.069
why I worked so hard in high school?

10:51.120 --> 10:53.854
So I could realize my dream.

10:53.872 --> 10:56.908
- To go to college?
- Without my parents!

10:58.210 --> 11:00.128
Ivy, relax,

11:00.162 --> 11:03.164
I'm sure once they think this
through, they'll come to their senses.

11:03.198 --> 11:06.033
Hey, Ivy, when weget down there,

11:06.051 --> 11:08.869
we can move the r. V.
Right next to your dorm,

11:08.887 --> 11:11.889
that way you can have
breakfast with us every morning.

11:11.924 --> 11:15.143
Or we can all get
a meal plan together.

11:15.177 --> 11:17.711
Doesn't that sound fun?

11:18.981 --> 11:22.016
I don't know, T., does it?

11:28.857 --> 11:30.908
- I love your house.
- Oh, thank you.

11:30.943 --> 11:32.860
I'm so glad we
could get together because...

11:32.894 --> 11:35.947
you've been wanting
to get to know us better?

11:35.998 --> 11:37.898
'Cause we feel the same way.

11:37.916 --> 11:40.751
That's so sweet. I actually
wasn't going to say that.

11:40.786 --> 11:43.737
But I'm very glad
to get to know you too.

11:45.073 --> 11:47.041
So where do you and Susan...

11:47.075 --> 11:50.044
come from.
Well, I...

11:50.078 --> 11:51.912
I actually grew up in Florida.

11:51.930 --> 11:53.714
But Susan is from Colorado.

11:53.748 --> 11:55.883
Okay, I was going to say "live,"

11:55.917 --> 11:59.770
but that's good information.
Yeah.

11:59.805 --> 12:02.140
- How long have you and Susan...
- Had a boat?

12:02.191 --> 12:05.026
Well, I grew up waterskiing,

12:05.060 --> 12:07.778
and then I got Susan into it. So I'd say

12:07.813 --> 12:09.763
it's been about eight years.

12:09.781 --> 12:11.866
Okay.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.952
Okay, um, actually, I was going to ask

12:14.987 --> 12:17.738
how long have you
and Susan been together?

12:17.772 --> 12:19.707
Oh. Well, let's see,

12:19.741 --> 12:21.108
we adopted Taylor four years ago,

12:21.126 --> 12:23.044
so we've been together 10 years now.

12:23.078 --> 12:24.962
<i>Oh, that's wonderful.</i>

12:24.997 --> 12:27.081
- Hi.
- Oh hi, Mom.

12:27.115 --> 12:29.884
Hey, guys. Cheryl, I
want you to meet my sons

12:29.918 --> 12:31.752
- Gabe and...
- Fred!

12:34.840 --> 12:36.757
No!

12:36.791 --> 12:39.093
- No no, it's P.J.
- Really?

12:39.127 --> 12:41.896
Yes, really!

12:41.930 --> 12:44.131
- He looks like a Fred.
- That's so funny.

12:44.149 --> 12:47.068
I've always felt more like a Fred.

12:47.102 --> 12:50.021
- Hey, Gabe, will you call me Fred from now on?
- No.

12:50.072 --> 12:52.023
Oh.

12:52.074 --> 12:53.991
What are you two doing
with that stuff?

12:54.026 --> 12:56.694
Oh, uh, they're broken,

12:56.745 --> 12:58.946
so we're taking them
to the fix-it shop.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.865
The one near my apartment.

13:00.916 --> 13:02.983
- Where I still live.
- Yeah.

13:04.169 --> 13:06.704
- See ya!
- Yeah.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.958
- P.J. Takes after...
- His father.

13:10.992 --> 13:12.993
Wow, you got that one right.

13:17.999 --> 13:20.718
Hey, I really appreciate you
helping me fix this place up, man.

13:20.769 --> 13:22.937
No problem. Like I always
say, if you can't do something

13:22.971 --> 13:25.106
behind Mom and Dad's back,
why do it at all?

13:26.174 --> 13:28.142
There's only one problem
with this place:

13:28.176 --> 13:29.977
I can't get wi-fi
from the house.

13:30.011 --> 13:32.680
Oh, try Mrs. Dabney's.
The password is "kaboodle."

13:34.700 --> 13:36.117
No. She must have changed it.

13:36.151 --> 13:38.703
Try "Gabe-Duncan-is-evil."

13:39.955 --> 13:42.856
- Nope.
- Did you use an exclamation point?

13:42.874 --> 13:44.709
We're in.

13:50.165 --> 13:53.033
- Hey, guys.
- There she is,

13:53.051 --> 13:55.002
our inspiration!

13:55.036 --> 13:59.090
Yeah, about that, can
we talk for a second?

13:59.141 --> 14:01.008
Sure, what's on your mind?

14:01.042 --> 14:05.146
Um... I think Ivy

14:05.180 --> 14:07.098
should go to college by herself.

14:08.883 --> 14:10.718
Without you.

14:11.820 --> 14:13.053
It's a part of growing up.

14:14.072 --> 14:16.023
But if you felt this way,

14:16.057 --> 14:18.693
why did you try to talk us
into going with her?

14:18.727 --> 14:21.729
Mm-hmm. We never would have
come up with that on our own.

14:22.998 --> 14:25.065
Okay, yes, that one's on me.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.900
I have some crazy ideas.

14:26.918 --> 14:29.704
Sometimes I get a little carried away.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.872
In that sense, you're a
little like your mother.

14:33.709 --> 14:37.011
Look, I know that you're
going to miss her a lot,

14:37.045 --> 14:39.747
but Ivy's ready to be on her own.

14:39.765 --> 14:41.766
What about us?

14:41.800 --> 14:44.101
We're not ready to be on our own.

14:45.771 --> 14:47.688
Maybe you don't have to be.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.141
Ivy!

14:52.144 --> 14:54.061
I got you a little
going-away present.

14:54.095 --> 14:56.731
Oh my goodness!
A doggy!

14:56.765 --> 14:58.699
Oh, look at the little guy!

14:58.734 --> 15:00.701
Harry, can you believe it?

15:00.736 --> 15:03.704
Just as our baby is going
away, we get a new baby.

15:03.739 --> 15:05.873
- Ooh, let's call him "baby"!
- Mm-hmm!

15:07.209 --> 15:10.628
Well, I think someone

15:10.662 --> 15:11.962
owes somebody a thank you.

15:11.997 --> 15:13.947
You want me to thank you
for solving a problem

15:13.965 --> 15:17.752
- that you created?
- It was a pretty bad problem.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.757
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.759
Hey, where's baby gonna sleep?

15:24.793 --> 15:27.011
On Ivy's bed.

15:27.062 --> 15:30.014
Uh, guys, I'm still
gonna be here tonight.

15:30.065 --> 15:32.767
You can sleep on the couch.

15:37.989 --> 15:40.658
Midges are like tiny flies.

15:40.692 --> 15:43.911
And after they hatch, they
swarm in this enormous cloud.

15:43.945 --> 15:46.980
Uh-huh. How did we get on midges again?

15:46.998 --> 15:49.817
Oh, we were watching the game.
Then I was telling you about

15:49.835 --> 15:51.952
that playoff game a few
years back, remember that?

15:51.986 --> 15:54.705
- When all the midges swarmed?
- Right right.

15:54.756 --> 15:57.041
We were watching the game.

15:57.092 --> 16:00.678
Hi there. Just wanted to check
and see how you guys were doing.

16:00.712 --> 16:02.830
- Doing great.
- How's the game?

16:02.848 --> 16:05.165
Don't know. We've been
so busy talking...

16:05.183 --> 16:08.719
About midges and stinkbugs.

16:08.770 --> 16:11.689
Bob, honey, can I see you in
the other room for just a sec?

16:11.723 --> 16:12.940
Excuse me.

16:19.981 --> 16:22.733
I want to trade Moms.

16:22.784 --> 16:25.035
- What do you mean?
- I don't like mine.

16:25.070 --> 16:27.855
- She's a sentence finisher.
- Ooh, that can be real...

16:27.873 --> 16:30.040
really really annoying.
Yeah, I know.

16:31.910 --> 16:34.795
But I like my Mom.
She loves my bug stories.

16:34.830 --> 16:37.081
- She's a great listener...
- She's a great listener?

16:37.132 --> 16:39.133
I want that one!

16:40.752 --> 16:43.036
I am not trading.
I like the Mom.

16:43.054 --> 16:46.039
But the Dad won't
stop talking... about bugs.

16:47.142 --> 16:49.810
The Mom and I were
hitting on all cylinders.

16:49.845 --> 16:51.846
We're even finishing
each other's sentences.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.047
You finish everyone's sentences!

16:55.984 --> 16:58.152
If you won't trade, I'm gonna
play the headache card.

16:58.186 --> 17:01.021
Oh come on. That's the
lamest trick in the world.

17:01.055 --> 17:02.723
I don't care.
I've had it.

17:02.741 --> 17:04.692
I want to finish a sentence!

17:09.079 --> 17:11.832
- Hey, guys.
- Amy, Bob,

17:11.867 --> 17:14.734
we are so sorry.
We have to go.

17:15.753 --> 17:18.622
I have a pounding headache.

17:20.090 --> 17:21.925
Oh no, can I get you something?

17:21.960 --> 17:24.011
No, mm-mm, no.
I just need to lie down...

17:24.045 --> 17:26.096
at home.

17:27.715 --> 17:28.933
So we'll just get Taylor and go.

17:28.967 --> 17:31.802
- But we will set up another playdate soon.
- Yes!

17:31.853 --> 17:33.771
Well, let me walk you out.

17:33.805 --> 17:35.890
No no, no need.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.776
- Bye now.
- Feel better.

17:38.810 --> 17:41.929
Yeah, feel better.

17:41.947 --> 17:45.699
How do you like that? She
played the headache card on you.

17:45.734 --> 17:47.768
No, she did not!

17:47.786 --> 17:50.788
- Yes, she did!
- No no, I was very interesting.

17:50.822 --> 17:53.774
That...
that was a real headache.

17:53.792 --> 17:56.076
Right, that was a real headache.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.745
Bob, honey, let's face it:

17:57.779 --> 17:59.780
Whether it's a Mom and a Dad

17:59.798 --> 18:01.966
or two Moms or two Dads,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.952
nobody likes your bug stories.

18:14.012 --> 18:16.063
<i>What?</i>

18:16.097 --> 18:18.933
- What happened?
- Maybe we overloaded the circuit.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.851
I'll go check.

18:21.987 --> 18:24.021
Oh!
Think I found the problem.

18:25.907 --> 18:28.108
So what's going on here?

18:28.142 --> 18:30.694
Before we tell you,
promise you won't tell Mom?

18:30.745 --> 18:32.780
Won't tell Mom what?

18:33.832 --> 18:36.116
Well, I guess we should
just come clean.

18:36.150 --> 18:37.785
Whoa whoa whoa.
Already?

18:37.819 --> 18:40.037
Traditionally we try
a couple lies first.

18:42.674 --> 18:45.042
Emmett and I got kicked out
of our apartment.

18:45.093 --> 18:46.677
- Oh!
- What?!

18:46.711 --> 18:48.963
Turns out not paying
the rent is a deal-breaker.

18:50.164 --> 18:52.099
Honey, why didn't you tell us?

18:52.133 --> 18:55.002
- We would have let you move back home.
- I was too embarrassed to ask.

18:55.020 --> 18:58.055
You guys are already putting me through cooking school.
You do enough for me already.

18:58.106 --> 19:00.024
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, that's true.

19:01.860 --> 19:04.111
P.J., you're following
your dream.

19:04.145 --> 19:07.014
And if you need help along
the way, we're here for you.

19:07.032 --> 19:08.866
Thanks. And I promise

19:08.900 --> 19:11.619
once I graduate cooking school,
I'll get a job and move out.

19:11.653 --> 19:14.955
Son, take as long as
you two-months need.

19:17.959 --> 19:19.994
What's going on up here?

19:20.028 --> 19:21.795
It's a progressive party

19:21.830 --> 19:23.797
and we're starting in the tree house.

19:23.832 --> 19:25.866
Are those my throw pillows?

19:25.884 --> 19:27.751
Yeah, they really tied
the room together.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.888
When was the last time
we were all in the tree house?

19:30.922 --> 19:33.641
Right before it fell down.

19:35.093 --> 19:36.927
Why does that sound familiar?

19:44.903 --> 19:46.654
Is everyone okay?

19:46.688 --> 19:47.688
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:47.722 --> 19:49.073
Wait a minute!

19:49.107 --> 19:50.908
Nobody move!

19:50.942 --> 19:52.826
Where is the gurgles poster?

19:59.117 --> 20:01.785
Okay, Ivy, have a great
first semester.

20:01.836 --> 20:03.837
And we'll see you at Christmas, right?

20:03.872 --> 20:05.956
You guys are like my second family.

20:07.709 --> 20:09.710
And if that dog has
really taken over my room,

20:09.744 --> 20:12.012
you might be my first family.

20:12.047 --> 20:13.931
Get over here.

20:14.966 --> 20:16.850
Now get out of here before I lose it.

20:16.885 --> 20:17.918
Okay.

20:24.092 --> 20:26.760
Well, I guess this is it.

20:29.731 --> 20:31.865
Thanks for being my best friend.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.984
And thank you.

20:34.035 --> 20:35.819
Thank you for being mine.

20:36.938 --> 20:39.773
- I love you, T.
- I love you too.

20:52.954 --> 20:54.888
Well, Charlie,

20:54.923 --> 20:57.124
there's a lot of changes
going on around here.

20:57.142 --> 21:00.010
Ivy's gone.
The tree house is gone...

21:00.061 --> 21:02.763
again.

21:02.797 --> 21:04.131
I'll be leaving for Yale soon

21:04.149 --> 21:06.850
and P.J. is moving back in.

21:06.901 --> 21:10.020
Yeah, I thought we'd get the number
of kids in the house down to three,

21:10.071 --> 21:12.806
but I guess we're holding at four!

21:14.142 --> 21:17.027
Dad, I told you once
I graduate cooking school,

21:17.078 --> 21:18.862
I'm gonna get a job
and I'll be out of here.

21:18.913 --> 21:21.031
And thanks for letting me
stay here, Mr. Duncan.

21:21.082 --> 21:23.117
Hey, what... what's
Emmett doing here?

21:23.151 --> 21:26.153
Just because we don't have an apartment
doesn't mean we're not roommates.

21:26.171 --> 21:28.122
Wait!

21:29.958 --> 21:33.794
The Wentzes get a puppy
and I get Emmett?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.835
Better wish Dad
some good luck, Charlie.

21:48.789 --> 21:50.674
No no no no.

21:50.725 --> 21:52.809
No no no! And I don't
want you using that take

21:52.844 --> 21:54.728
and that's why I'm stopping now.

21:54.762 --> 21:57.848
Boy, something's been
going on down here.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.734
- Oh yes!
- What is my line?

22:00.768 --> 22:02.936
Great news!

22:02.970 --> 22:06.490
I just checked...
