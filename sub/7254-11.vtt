00:00.648 --> 00:02.267
Previously on
"Gilmore Girls"...

00:02.277 --> 00:04.273
- Hey.
- Look, it's Liz's new baby.

00:04.283 --> 00:07.017
I've decided that April and I
are gonna move to New Mexico.

00:07.027 --> 00:07.664
Really?

00:07.674 --> 00:09.101
They've known each other
since freshman year.

00:09.131 --> 00:11.886
I don't understand. You guys are
friends? You know each other?

00:11.896 --> 00:14.358
She's my kid, all right?
She's our kid.

00:14.368 --> 00:15.828
She's not just yours.

00:15.838 --> 00:17.479
What is your problem
with a wedding?

00:17.487 --> 00:19.090
- We're already married.
- So what's the big deal?

00:19.122 --> 00:21.184
You planned a whole huge
wedding with that diner guy.

00:21.214 --> 00:22.594
"That diner guy"?

00:22.604 --> 00:24.664
The court only cares
what's best for April.

00:24.679 --> 00:26.590
In these types of cases,

00:26.605 --> 00:28.651
they almost always
side with the mother.

00:28.667 --> 00:31.972
- She doesn't want to see you right now.
- Let me explain. Please.

01:00.707 --> 01:02.961
The redcoats are coming!
The redcoats are coming!

01:02.978 --> 01:04.413
The redcoats are coming!

01:04.425 --> 01:06.750
Whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, missy.

01:06.765 --> 01:08.891
Got to put on your
jacket first, okay?

01:10.618 --> 01:12.133
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:12.148 --> 01:14.452
- I'm so mad at you!
- What kind of greeting is that?

01:14.466 --> 01:16.310
What kind of daughter doesn't let her
mother pick her up at the airport?

01:16.347 --> 01:18.443
The kind of daughter who parks
her car at the airport car park.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.631
But I'm the kind of mother who picks
her daughter up from the airport.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.833
You know, with flowers and coffee
and a fake chauffeur's sign.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.330
Why would you mess
with my sense of self?

01:24.366 --> 01:26.252
But my car was parked at
the airport car park.

01:26.268 --> 01:29.251
So what? I could have driven to the
airport, picked you up, brought you back.

01:29.287 --> 01:31.580
Then we both could have driven to
pick up your car and come back here.

01:31.618 --> 01:33.533
Yeah, 'cause that wouldn't be
a waste of gas or anything.

01:33.565 --> 01:36.433
Oh. Oh, God.
Did you pack Big Ben?

01:36.447 --> 01:37.930
I still think it
was kind of risky.

01:37.945 --> 01:38.663
What's risky?

01:38.677 --> 01:40.212
You've spent a lot of
time across the pond.

01:40.247 --> 01:43.290
You might get confused and forget
which side of the road to drive on.

01:43.307 --> 01:45.013
Yes, it was a near escape.

01:45.025 --> 01:46.821
Hey! Welcome home!

01:46.835 --> 01:48.392
The redcoat is here!

01:48.406 --> 01:49.800
Hi, dad!

01:49.815 --> 01:51.450
- How are you doing?
- Good.

01:51.465 --> 01:52.920
Hi, little sister.

01:52.937 --> 01:55.232
Oh, hello. Okay. Oh.

01:55.298 --> 01:57.103
Oh. Well, all right.

01:57.988 --> 01:59.753
- So, you made it here okay?
- Yeah.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.491
I was thinking --
all that time in England,

02:01.508 --> 02:03.592
you might forget which side
of the road to drive on.

02:03.608 --> 02:05.012
Hey, don't steal my material.

02:05.027 --> 02:05.922
What do you mean,
your material?

02:05.955 --> 02:06.902
I just made that joke.

02:06.915 --> 02:08.791
The drive-on-the-other-side-
of-the-road thing? That's my joke.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.413
If you just made it,
you ripped me off.

02:10.426 --> 02:12.192
- I ripped you off?
- Guys.

02:12.208 --> 02:15.390
That's like saying Lenny
Bruce rips off Carrot Top

02:15.405 --> 02:17.513
or Woody Allen gets his material
from what's his name --

02:17.546 --> 02:18.702
the guy with the watermelons.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.832
I did not rip you off --
no way, no how, sister.

02:21.848 --> 02:24.093
I made that joke this morning at
breakfast. We were sitting there.

02:24.127 --> 02:25.222
- We were drinking coffee.
- Guys...

02:25.256 --> 02:27.392
not that that's not
a hilarious joke,

02:27.406 --> 02:29.001
but the guy at the car
park made the same one.

02:29.037 --> 02:32.111
Hey, G.G., would you want
to take this inside for me?

02:32.127 --> 02:33.600
Come on, Geege.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.480
- Ohh!
- What?

02:36.496 --> 02:38.040
You took the
Christmas lights down.

02:38.055 --> 02:39.441
I didn't take them down.
I haven't put them up yet.

02:39.477 --> 02:40.800
I saved Christmas for you.

02:40.815 --> 02:43.290
Before you left, we said we were
gonna wait and do Christmas together.

02:43.326 --> 02:44.862
Okay, yeah, but --

02:44.877 --> 02:46.173
What are those?

02:46.517 --> 02:47.611
What are what?

02:47.625 --> 02:49.402
Are those a Christmas
present from Logan?

02:49.418 --> 02:51.220
No, I mean -- well, yeah,

02:51.236 --> 02:53.911
but it's more like a late
birthday/new year's present.

02:53.927 --> 02:54.902
Stop sniffing me.

02:54.916 --> 02:56.262
I smell Christmas cookies.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.662
There's no way you can smell
cookies from six days ago.

02:58.676 --> 02:59.880
So there were
Christmas cookies.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.182
There may have been
a little Christmas.

03:01.217 --> 03:02.323
Unbelievable!

03:02.338 --> 03:04.822
London, as a city,
is very Christmas-obsessed, okay?

03:04.836 --> 03:06.912
I couldn't help what
was going on around me.

03:06.927 --> 03:08.352
But inside, I assure you,

03:08.366 --> 03:10.550
I was devoid of the Christmas spirit --
a complete scrooge.

03:10.587 --> 03:12.221
I didn't let any
Christmas happen.

03:12.237 --> 03:14.830
I  grinched it up so hard,
I didn't let it snow.

03:14.848 --> 03:16.202
What? It hasn't snowed yet?

03:16.215 --> 03:18.651
Thanks to me thinking of you and
our agreement, our pledge, our oath.

03:18.685 --> 03:19.720
You stopped the snow?

03:19.736 --> 03:21.821
Yes, sheer force of will.

03:21.838 --> 03:24.550
We said we would have no Christmas,
so I had no Christmas.

03:24.566 --> 03:26.052
You must have had
a little Christmas.

03:26.067 --> 03:26.893
None.

03:26.905 --> 03:28.260
- No presents?
- No presents.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.211
- No tree?
- No tree.

03:29.226 --> 03:31.140
- No eggnog?
- No egg, no nog.

03:31.157 --> 03:33.543
I sat in the dark with the
lights off and ate gruel.

03:33.556 --> 03:36.592
Okay, mom, I hereby apologize

03:36.606 --> 03:39.010
for any accidental Christmas
celebrating I may have done.

03:39.025 --> 03:40.643
I'm now ready to celebrate
Christmas for real.

03:40.676 --> 03:41.682
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:41.698 --> 03:42.752
Okay!

03:43.558 --> 03:44.970
So, you stopped the snow?

03:44.986 --> 03:46.460
Yeah. I did an anti-snow dance.

03:46.477 --> 03:49.281
It was humiliating and arduous,
but I had made a promise to my daughter.

03:49.298 --> 03:51.580
- Humiliating?
- Two words -- coconut bra.

04:46.695 --> 04:48.452
- Where am I taking this?
- Living room.

04:48.465 --> 04:50.452
- I love our trees!
- Me too!

04:50.468 --> 04:52.261
- You don't think our trees are...
- What?

04:52.275 --> 04:54.441
- Maybe a little homely?
- Homely?!

04:54.457 --> 04:55.841
- I'm just saying.
- What?

04:55.858 --> 04:56.662
What are you saying?

04:56.677 --> 04:59.312
That our trees are not classically
good-looking. If you were to look up "tree"

04:59.348 --> 05:01.450
in the dictionary, 
you would not find one of these fellas.

05:01.487 --> 05:03.023
Why would you look up
"tree" in the dictionary?

05:03.056 --> 05:04.763
So we don't have classically
good-looking trees.

05:04.796 --> 05:05.910
You don't know what a tree is?

05:05.946 --> 05:07.751
- Come on, look at that tree.
- I'm looking.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.260
- That tree has character.
- It does.

05:09.278 --> 05:11.632
That tree has earned
character by persevering

05:11.648 --> 05:15.361
through freezing winters
and forest fires and floods.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.280
This tree's a fighter.

05:16.295 --> 05:18.863
Woodpeckers. Maniacal woodpeckers
just pecking at its trunk.

05:18.875 --> 05:19.662
S urvivor.

05:19.676 --> 05:20.981
Peck, peck, peck,
day in and day out.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.572
That tree's a champion.

05:22.605 --> 05:24.471
It smells so good in
here with all our trees.

05:24.486 --> 05:26.372
It's like a dozen
car air fresheners.

05:26.387 --> 05:29.311
Just imagine how good it's gonna be
once all of our trees are in here.

05:29.326 --> 05:30.422
This is crazy!

05:30.437 --> 05:32.483
- Seven trees.
- Which was crazy.

05:32.496 --> 05:33.933
What? Buck a tree.

05:33.948 --> 05:36.572
Dad, we have to have at least
one tree in the kitchen.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.882
Yeah, dad.

05:37.897 --> 05:40.163
I'm in a forest of crazy.

05:40.705 --> 05:42.431
- Buck a tree.
- Genius.

05:42.447 --> 05:45.231
So genius. We better be careful,
or word will get out

05:45.247 --> 05:47.383
and everyone will start celebrating
Christmas after Christmas,

05:47.415 --> 05:50.342
which will really drive up the
post-Christmas Christmas-tree prices.

05:50.358 --> 05:52.272
Then we'll have to keep
celebrating later and later.

05:52.306 --> 05:55.283
Yeah, before we know it,
we'll be having figgy pudding in july.

05:55.296 --> 05:57.381
Look! G.G.!

05:57.507 --> 05:59.850
You know who made this? Rory.

05:59.862 --> 06:01.954
Rory made this when she
was right about your age.

06:01.964 --> 06:03.194
That's nice.

06:03.204 --> 06:04.284
Someone's not impressed.

06:04.299 --> 06:06.292
She doesn't understand
abstract art.

06:06.308 --> 06:07.150
Philistine.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.523
Hey, look at this.
Here's Santa's costume.

06:10.535 --> 06:11.831
Wow. That's seen better days.

06:11.847 --> 06:13.872
Why do you have
Santa's clothes?

06:13.887 --> 06:17.080
Because... I...
used to do Santa's dry cleaning.

06:17.096 --> 06:18.583
- You did?
- Yeah.

06:18.596 --> 06:20.170
- Wow.
- I know.

06:20.186 --> 06:22.020
Okay, everybody can relax.

06:22.037 --> 06:24.543
There's  now a Christmas
tree in the kitchen.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.393
Thank you.

06:25.408 --> 06:27.523
Oh! My antlers!
I love my antlers!

06:27.535 --> 06:28.922
Oh, neat!

06:28.938 --> 06:30.761
Let me try!

06:31.377 --> 06:33.571
On Vixen! On Blinxen !

06:33.588 --> 06:36.173
Kid took my antlers. She took my
antlers and she galloped away.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.052
All right,
now tell me more about London.

06:38.068 --> 06:39.842
Did everything work out
with Logan after the whole

06:39.877 --> 06:41.582
Marty/Lucy/dinner debacle?

06:41.597 --> 06:43.542
Well, I was pretty
angry for a while,

06:43.555 --> 06:46.172
especially after he blurted out
all that stuff the way he did,

06:46.185 --> 06:48.640
but he apologized a lot

06:48.658 --> 06:51.602
and even admitted that he was a
little jealous, so I forgave him.

06:51.616 --> 06:52.712
Well, that's good.

06:52.727 --> 06:55.133
Yeah. Well, plus I realized
a lot of it was my fault.

06:55.145 --> 06:56.410
You know, I was Lucy's friend.

06:56.427 --> 06:58.631
I should have been straight
with her about knowing Marty.

06:58.665 --> 07:02.661
I just can't believe I got suckered
into that whole thing for so long.

07:02.677 --> 07:04.313
I don't blame her
for hating me.

07:04.328 --> 07:05.952
So have you talked to her now?

07:05.966 --> 07:07.221
I've left messages.

07:07.236 --> 07:08.332
Oh, hon.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.323
Wow! Look at all this!

07:10.335 --> 07:12.443
Yeah, we have a lot
of Christmas stuff.

07:13.087 --> 07:15.063
Cool. Mistletoe.

07:15.075 --> 07:16.140
Where are you going with that?

07:16.176 --> 07:17.263
I'm gonna hang it
up in the doorway.

07:17.298 --> 07:18.663
Oh, that's not where it goes.

07:18.678 --> 07:19.451
Where does it go?

07:19.468 --> 07:21.941
We tape it to one of the blades
of the ceiling fan upstairs.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.791
That way,
the kissing is more like a sport.

07:23.808 --> 07:24.723
One of our traditions.

07:24.735 --> 07:25.841
That's a tradition?

07:25.856 --> 07:27.473
Our traditions are
very important to us.

07:27.486 --> 07:29.463
What other traditions
am I in for?

07:29.478 --> 07:32.503
On Christmas morning, we put red
and green M&M's in our cereal.

07:32.518 --> 07:33.481
Down with that.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.491
We string up our
stockings on the banister.

07:35.506 --> 07:38.931
Yes, we used to string them up on the
traditional place of the fireplace,

07:38.948 --> 07:42.083
but then there was that fire incident,
and they nearly burned to bits.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.713
So now we put them on little
nails on the banister.

07:44.728 --> 07:47.800
Oh, we always go to Weston's for a
cup of holiday candy-cane coffee,

07:47.817 --> 07:49.131
which is so delicious.

07:49.148 --> 07:51.482
Delicious. And we bake cookies.

07:51.495 --> 07:52.561
You bake?

07:52.578 --> 07:54.841
Well, we put on some Christmas music,
drink eggnog,

07:54.857 --> 07:57.292
and pretend to bake the cookies
we actually bought from Weston's.

07:57.325 --> 07:59.191
We do, however,
make our own frosting.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.832
We use a handheld electric
mixer from the dark ages

08:01.848 --> 08:04.571
so that Rory can continue the
tradition of licking the beaters.

08:04.588 --> 08:06.811
Yes, a skill which I have
perfected over the years.

08:06.828 --> 08:09.972
And then on Christmas Eve, we leave
the cookies out for Santa's reindeer.

08:09.986 --> 08:11.123
Santa prefers gum.

08:11.135 --> 08:13.150
Well, I am very excited
about these traditions,

08:13.166 --> 08:16.153
but, you know, because it's our
first Christmas together as a family,

08:16.166 --> 08:18.613
I thought maybe it was time
to start some new traditions.

08:18.628 --> 08:19.831
Like what?

08:19.847 --> 08:21.482
Well, for starters...

08:22.637 --> 08:23.910
I got us these.

08:23.925 --> 08:24.790
Wow.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.672
Oh, they're so big and flashy.

08:26.685 --> 08:27.911
I got one for each of us.

08:27.928 --> 08:30.703
But we have stockings already.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.413
I mean,
they're a little singed from the fire,

08:33.428 --> 08:34.751
but they're still usable.

08:34.767 --> 08:36.732
But not stockings like these.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.023
That's true.

08:38.038 --> 08:40.253
All right, this will be a new tradition.
I'm gonna hang them up.

08:40.288 --> 08:42.513
You know what else we should do?
We should go caroling.

08:42.525 --> 08:43.900
- No.
- Are you kidding?

08:43.914 --> 08:45.280
Come on, it'll be fun.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.323
It wouldn't be fun for
strangers to hear us sing.

08:48.336 --> 08:50.210
- It'd be cruel, that's what it would be.
- And embarrassing.

08:50.247 --> 08:52.203
Guys, carols are beautiful.

08:52.215 --> 08:55.171
# Glo-o-o-o-o-o #

08:55.185 --> 08:57.443
# o-o-o-o-o #

08:57.455 --> 09:01.153
# o-o-o-o-oria #

09:01.376 --> 09:06.353
# In excelsis deo #

09:11.675 --> 09:13.853
Yes, sir. Thank you. 

09:14.216 --> 09:16.423
Oh. You.

09:16.436 --> 09:18.150
I thought we were
done with you.

09:18.167 --> 09:20.240
Hi, Michel. Is Lorelai here?

09:22.598 --> 09:25.040
Hey. Can you tell
Lorelai that...

09:25.055 --> 09:27.701
someone is here to see her?

09:32.545 --> 09:35.621
Well, this is awfully awkward.

09:35.636 --> 09:38.390
We should make some
sort of conversation.

09:40.057 --> 09:43.023
I see your sense of
style has not changed.

09:43.038 --> 09:43.773
N ope.

09:43.785 --> 09:48.433
I've often wondered, does someone in
your family own a flannel company?

09:48.446 --> 09:49.832
Uh, no.

09:52.407 --> 09:54.060
You know what?
I cannot do this.

09:54.108 --> 09:57.391
Let us just stand here and let
the awkwardness wash over us.

09:57.408 --> 09:58.701
Fine by me.

10:02.706 --> 10:04.531
- Hi.
- Ahh, here she is.

10:04.545 --> 10:06.691
It's been a delight
chatting with you.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.333
- I'm sorry to just barge in like this.
- That's okay.

10:09.345 --> 10:10.792
Can we talk somewhere?

10:10.806 --> 10:12.290
Um, sure.

10:17.078 --> 10:19.803
Anna wants to move to
New Mexico with April.

10:19.816 --> 10:20.800
New  Mexico?

10:20.816 --> 10:24.803
Anna's mother just had major surgery,
and she's not doing so well.

10:24.816 --> 10:26.982
And Anna wants to be near her,
which I get.

10:26.995 --> 10:31.621
It's just I'd like to see April
on some weekends and vacations.

10:31.637 --> 10:33.340
- Of course.
- But Anna says no.

10:33.355 --> 10:37.003
In fact, right now,
she's not letting me see April at all,

10:37.018 --> 10:39.721
so I have to fight for custody,

10:39.735 --> 10:41.640
and I'm going to court.

10:41.656 --> 10:43.802
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's the whole thing.

10:43.816 --> 10:46.731
I got to get a lawyer and wear a tie.
It's not a whole lot of fun.

10:46.748 --> 10:48.182
It's good you're
doing it, though.

10:48.198 --> 10:51.793
Well, I can't not.
You know, I mean, I can't not do it.

10:51.807 --> 10:52.760
Right.

10:52.777 --> 10:57.480
So, anyway, um,
the court date is coming up.

10:57.495 --> 11:00.390
And I need a
character reference.

11:00.407 --> 11:03.723
And Liz wrote one, but my lawyer
read it, and he said it was sweet,

11:03.738 --> 11:07.180
but it was filled with all
these weird childhood anecdotes

11:07.198 --> 11:11.290
that I probably don't want to share
with anyone, much less a court of law.

11:11.308 --> 11:14.080
And I need another one,
and I just don't know who to go to.

11:14.095 --> 11:16.910
And I know it's an
awful lot to ask.

11:16.928 --> 11:19.391
And if it's weird or whatever,
I mean, I totally understand.

11:19.408 --> 11:20.402
Yes.

11:20.416 --> 11:22.431
But if you could, uh...

11:22.456 --> 11:24.100
Yes, I'll do it.

11:24.135 --> 11:25.533
Yeah?

11:25.928 --> 11:29.751
Okay. All right, well,
this is my lawyer's address,

11:29.765 --> 11:32.671
and you can just mail the
letter directly to him.

11:32.688 --> 11:33.560
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:33.578 --> 11:37.101
And, look, if you don't mind, if you
could do it as soon as possible...

11:37.115 --> 11:38.953
The court date's right
around the corner.

11:38.968 --> 11:40.750
- Definitely.
- Thanks. Thank you.

11:40.766 --> 11:43.132
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

11:43.165 --> 11:46.612
Okay, well... I'll just...

11:46.626 --> 11:48.793
- Thanks.
- Sure. I'll get right on it.

11:48.807 --> 11:51.083
- I send it to here. Okay.
- All right.

11:51.095 --> 11:52.222
Thanks.

11:52.238 --> 11:53.783
Okay.

12:07.366 --> 12:09.003
No, that should do it. Thanks.

12:09.015 --> 12:10.650
- Ugh!
- It's hard, huh?

12:10.666 --> 12:13.073
Yeah, the pressure is a lot,
you know?

12:13.086 --> 12:14.080
Yeah, of course.

12:14.095 --> 12:16.571
I mean, I just keep thinking that
whatever I write might help save

12:16.608 --> 12:19.090
Luke's relationship with his kid,
which is huge and important,

12:19.108 --> 12:22.483
so the pressure's really getting to me
-- that and a lack of sufficient caffeine.

12:22.497 --> 12:25.140
Of course. Totally.
Plus, it's Luke,

12:25.156 --> 12:27.613
and after all you've been through,
it's got to be hard.

12:27.628 --> 12:28.723
Well, yeah.

12:28.735 --> 12:31.741
You're having to dig up
all those feelings for him.

12:31.758 --> 12:34.360
That can't be fun.
You must be feeling overwhelmed.

12:34.375 --> 12:37.111
I don't think it's about
digging up my feelings for Luke.

12:37.126 --> 12:37.730
Okay.

12:37.745 --> 12:39.782
I think it's really about
writing an amazing letter.

12:39.815 --> 12:41.422
I mean, the stakes
are really high for him,

12:41.456 --> 12:45.362
and I want it to be something
amazing and powerful,

12:45.378 --> 12:47.602
you know,
like Gettysburg address powerful

12:47.616 --> 12:49.660
or "I have a dream" powerful.

12:49.675 --> 12:52.210
So, I'm thinking I'll look
a couple of those up online

12:52.226 --> 12:55.232
and just pop the name "Luke"
in there and be done with it.

12:55.248 --> 12:56.763
Sure. I don't think
anyone will notice.

12:56.795 --> 12:57.920
All right, back to work.

12:57.937 --> 12:59.212
Good luck.

13:35.035 --> 13:37.500
Is it twins?
It's got to be twins.

13:37.518 --> 13:39.122
- Is what twins?
- Are you...

13:39.138 --> 13:40.881
Pregnant? You
think I'm pregnant?

13:40.897 --> 13:43.803
Oh yeah, because it's not acceptable in
this society to be a plus-sized woman

13:43.838 --> 13:45.530
who happens to carry
her weight in her belly.

13:45.565 --> 13:47.471
So you're not -- oh, gee.

13:47.485 --> 13:50.390
Well, I need new glasses.
I'm sorry.

13:50.408 --> 13:52.781
Of course I'm pregnant.
Turkey with swiss.

13:55.528 --> 13:57.981
Hey! Hey!
What's up with this tip?

13:57.995 --> 13:59.160
Oh, I'm... sorry.

13:59.177 --> 14:01.610
This is 50%.
I don't need your pity tips.

14:01.628 --> 14:04.383
Okay, I'm pregnant,
not homeless.

14:05.205 --> 14:07.731
April! Hey!

14:07.745 --> 14:09.200
Wow. What are you doing?

14:09.216 --> 14:12.082
Well, I biked over because --
oh, my gosh. Lane is gigantic.

14:12.097 --> 14:13.500
I wouldn't mention
that to Lane.

14:13.518 --> 14:16.500
Hey, did you know the gestation
period for an elephant is 22 months?

14:16.516 --> 14:18.860
I wouldn't mention that to Lane, either.
So what do you doing here?

14:18.896 --> 14:20.250
Does your mother
know you're here?

14:20.266 --> 14:21.703
She doesn't have a clue. 

14:21.716 --> 14:24.093
You see, I told her I was
gonna spend the whole day

14:24.107 --> 14:27.002
at the Boston museum of science
with my friend Melissa and her dad.

14:27.018 --> 14:30.181
And it's perfect because mom confirmed
things with Melissa's dad two days ago.

14:30.198 --> 14:33.552
But, then yesterday, I told
Melissa's dad that I couldn't come

14:33.565 --> 14:35.221
because I had gotten the curse,

14:35.338 --> 14:38.740
which is perfect, 'cause you know how
awkward men get about menstruation.

14:38.756 --> 14:41.811
Yeah, look, it's really great to
see you, but this isn't gonna work.

14:41.827 --> 14:43.500
There's  no way mom will
ever figure it out.

14:43.536 --> 14:46.153
I even read all about cotton-topped
tamarin monkeys they have there

14:46.185 --> 14:49.651
and the Van de Graaff generator, so I'll
have plenty to tell her when I get back.

14:49.666 --> 14:51.191
I'm gonna have to
take you home.

14:51.207 --> 14:52.453
- No!
- I'm sorry.

14:52.505 --> 14:54.690
Dad, no. Please, no.
I've missed you so much.

14:54.708 --> 14:56.002
I missed you, too.

14:56.018 --> 14:57.620
I haven't seen you
in ages and ages.

14:57.636 --> 15:00.702
Plus, if you take me home now,
mom will know that I lied,

15:00.716 --> 15:02.762
and I'll get into
so much trouble.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.781
- Please?
- I don't know.

15:05.055 --> 15:06.550
Here. This is for you.

15:06.568 --> 15:08.573
Merry belated Christmas.
Sorry it looks like this.

15:08.586 --> 15:10.500
I couldn't exactly wrap
it in wrapping paper

15:10.517 --> 15:12.573
without arousing
maternal suspicions,

15:12.588 --> 15:13.823
if you know what I mean.

15:13.836 --> 15:16.463
Thanks. I actually got
you something, too.

15:16.478 --> 15:17.383
You did?

15:17.398 --> 15:18.581
Yeah.

15:19.136 --> 15:21.672
So, are you hungry or what?

15:21.687 --> 15:22.832
Tuna-fish sandwiches?

15:22.847 --> 15:24.283
That's what I was
thinking, too.

15:24.296 --> 15:26.510
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

15:27.918 --> 15:29.843
Be very careful
with your needle.

15:29.858 --> 15:30.662
I know.

15:30.676 --> 15:32.772
Okay, because it's really,
really pointy.

15:32.787 --> 15:33.803
I know.

15:33.816 --> 15:35.580
Okay, so what guidelines
did he give you?

15:35.596 --> 15:37.792
None. No guidelines.
No guidelines whatsoever.

15:37.807 --> 15:39.341
I'm supposed to write
a character reference,

15:39.377 --> 15:41.470
so I thought I'd
reference his character.

15:41.486 --> 15:42.632
Sounds like you're
on the right track.

15:42.665 --> 15:44.920
No, I'm not,
because it turns out I can't write.

15:44.938 --> 15:46.863
- Oh, sure, you can.
- No, I can't.

15:46.877 --> 15:50.431
I stare at the blank page,
and I just keep staring and staring.

15:50.446 --> 15:52.682
And eventually I have to get
up and lubricate my eyeballs.

15:52.716 --> 15:55.012
Otherwise, they would fall
out of my head, like raisins.

15:55.028 --> 15:57.472
Well, are you using a pen?
You can't just stare at the paper.

15:57.487 --> 15:59.512
You have to have a writing
implement of some kind.

15:59.527 --> 16:00.573
Look.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.771
- Very pretty, honey.
- What a good job.

16:02.786 --> 16:05.183
You know what I really like?
Your cranberry-to-popcorn ratio.

16:05.216 --> 16:07.801
Rory's more of a one-to-one kind of gal,
but I'm like you.

16:07.818 --> 16:10.213
I like a lot of cranberry,
little popcorn for flair.

16:10.228 --> 16:11.731
- Yours is pretty, too.
- Thank you.

16:11.745 --> 16:13.532
I have a writing implement.
The problem is

16:13.547 --> 16:15.771
that everything I write
sounds so schmucky.

16:15.786 --> 16:17.951
I'm sure that's not true.
We're running low on cranberries.

16:17.987 --> 16:22.220
"Luke Danes is a highly regarded
member of this community.

16:22.318 --> 16:25.693
Not an ill word can be
spoken of Mr. Danes."

16:25.707 --> 16:29.132
It's like I'm some documentary
narrator from the history channel.

16:29.145 --> 16:31.583
And you know what phrase
I keep using? "Stand-up."

16:31.598 --> 16:33.931
"Luke Danes is a stand-up guy.

16:33.946 --> 16:36.672
He's an upstanding
member of Stars Hollow,

16:36.687 --> 16:38.502
a real stand-up citizen."

16:38.516 --> 16:40.171
People are gonna think he's
turned into a comedian.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.712
Sounds like you're
overthinking this.

16:41.726 --> 16:43.261
Maybe if you just
put pen to paper.

16:43.278 --> 16:46.452
I tried that. I thought, "I'll just
sit down and write whatever comes --

16:46.468 --> 16:48.190
no judgment, no inner critic."

16:48.205 --> 16:50.062
- Was that a bad idea.
- Really? Why?

16:50.078 --> 16:53.953
Because my brain is a wild
jungle full of scary gibberish.

16:53.968 --> 16:55.271
"I'm writing a letter.
I can't write a letter.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.343
Why can't I write a letter?
I'm wearing a green dress.

16:57.377 --> 16:59.960
I wish I was wearing my blue dress.
My blue dress is at the cleaners.

16:59.995 --> 17:03.532
'The germans wore gray. You wore blue.'
'Casablanca' is such a good movie.

17:03.545 --> 17:05.131
'Casablanca.' The
white house. Bush.

17:05.146 --> 17:07.650
Why don't I drive a hybrid car?
I should drive a hybrid car.

17:07.666 --> 17:10.531
I should really take my bicycle to work.
Bicycle. Unicycle. Unitard.

17:10.547 --> 17:13.531
Hockey puck. Rattlesnake.
Monkey, monkey, underpants."

17:13.545 --> 17:15.883
"Hockey puck, rattlesnake,
monkey, monkey, underpants"?

17:15.897 --> 17:17.609
Exactly. That's
what I'm saying.

17:17.625 --> 17:19.142
It's a big bag of
weird in there.

17:19.156 --> 17:21.303
So, I think I need inspiration.

17:21.318 --> 17:23.871
I need a muse.
Perhaps I need "the muse."

17:23.885 --> 17:26.153
Maybe it would help if Sharon
Stone would appear to me

17:26.166 --> 17:28.750
in an alarming caftan and coo
inspirational words in my ear.

17:28.766 --> 17:30.723
Just write what you feel.
That's all writing is.

17:30.736 --> 17:32.382
Hey, do you think there
might be some reason

17:32.415 --> 17:33.653
why you're having
trouble with this?

17:33.685 --> 17:36.391
I would imagine that writing
about Luke wouldn't be easy.

17:36.408 --> 17:38.363
- I know. You should write it.
- What? No.

17:38.377 --> 17:41.943
Yes. You are a wonderful writer.
Everything you write is so good.

17:41.956 --> 17:44.382
Your grocery lists are
like shimmering haikus.

17:44.395 --> 17:46.093
You write a pretty mean
grocery list yourself.

17:46.128 --> 17:48.683
And it doesn't have to shimmer.
It just has to be authentic and real.

17:48.715 --> 17:49.891
Oh! You know what I'm gonna do?

17:49.927 --> 17:50.901
Write my thing for me.

17:50.916 --> 17:53.271
No, I'm going to
write a letter to Lucy

17:53.287 --> 17:55.992
explaining how sorry I am.
That way, she doesn't have to see me,

17:56.007 --> 17:57.891
and she can just read it
and she'll still know.

17:57.905 --> 18:01.090
That's great. And after you do that,
you can write my letter for me.

18:01.106 --> 18:03.372
No. This is something you
have to write for yourself.

18:03.387 --> 18:05.632
- What letter?
- Uh... to Santa.

18:05.646 --> 18:06.603
Wow.

18:06.615 --> 18:07.952
You know what my problem is?

18:07.967 --> 18:10.552
It's the whole
writing-by-hand thing.

18:10.566 --> 18:14.252
You know? I think what would help is if
I got my old electric typewriter out.

18:14.268 --> 18:16.460
The soothing sound of
that irritating buzzing,

18:16.478 --> 18:18.323
- that's what would help me.
- I'm home!

18:18.337 --> 18:22.620
So, cranberries really stay on the
string, and popcorn falls right off.

18:22.637 --> 18:24.103
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, everybody.

18:24.118 --> 18:25.240
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, dad.

18:25.258 --> 18:26.621
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:27.586 --> 18:29.351
Wow. Look at those.

18:29.368 --> 18:30.733
They're for the trees.

18:30.748 --> 18:31.770
So, what do you
have in the bag?

18:31.807 --> 18:34.172
No snooping.
This is Santa's secret stuff.

18:34.185 --> 18:36.401
- Lorelai knows Santa.
- Oh, yeah?

18:36.418 --> 18:38.412
She does Santa's dry cleaning.

18:38.428 --> 18:41.700
Well, Lorelai is a
remarkable woman.

18:58.688 --> 19:01.393
- The yellow squash?
- Yes, they're a delicacy.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.061
We're going to steam them
along with the broccoli.

19:03.096 --> 19:05.113
Is that adult broccoli?
Can you do that with baby squash?

19:05.146 --> 19:06.920
Yes, it's very
high in oxidants.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.191
- Welcome home, babe.
- Welcome home, Lane.

19:08.228 --> 19:10.591
So we went to the nature mart,
and guess what we got you.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.350
Turnip greens -- turns out they
got a sick amount of folic acid.

19:13.366 --> 19:16.180
What else did we get?
Squash, zucchini, tofu.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.892
Special calcium fortified tofu.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.750
And the calcium's real important
because you're not eating

19:19.785 --> 19:22.810
some of your previous calcium sources,
like soft cheese.

19:22.825 --> 19:24.311
You're not eating soft cheese,
are you?

19:24.347 --> 19:26.812
No. I'm not having
any soft cheese.

19:26.828 --> 19:28.570
- And no sushi?
- And no duck.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.090
We don't want the babies
to have webbed feet.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.242
So the duck sushi I had for lunch
was probably a mistake, huh?

19:33.256 --> 19:35.221
I'm kidding, mama.

19:35.588 --> 19:36.850
I am beat.

19:36.865 --> 19:39.470
Today at work,
it was absolutely ridiculous.

19:39.488 --> 19:42.580
Every other customer was "baby" crazy!
I'm gonna tell Luke tomorrow.

19:42.595 --> 19:44.330
- You should put your feet up.
- I'm fine.

19:44.347 --> 19:46.253
- How are your ankles?
- They're fine.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.552
You know what I was reading about?
Compression pantyhose.

19:48.566 --> 19:51.033
A lot of pregnant women wear
them to help with circulation.

19:51.045 --> 19:53.701
How are your bladder? Are the babies
putting a lot of pressure on your bladder?

19:53.735 --> 19:54.780
What? I don't know.

19:54.798 --> 19:56.743
How many times did
you urinate today?

19:56.758 --> 19:59.203
Oh, my god, Zach!
I am so not answering that question!

19:59.218 --> 20:01.383
Here are some new prenatal
vitamins we bought you.

20:01.396 --> 20:03.731
I'm going to put them
on your bedside table.

20:03.746 --> 20:06.583
You have to take two every
morning the moment you wake up.

20:06.597 --> 20:08.370
Maybe I need to
make you a chart.

20:08.387 --> 20:10.040
I don't need a chart.

20:10.068 --> 20:13.000
I happen to know that you forgot
to take your calcium tablets

20:13.016 --> 20:14.321
for two mornings.

20:14.335 --> 20:15.813
That is not right, Lane.

20:15.828 --> 20:17.080
Mama, you're counting my pills?

20:17.098 --> 20:18.632
Yes, of course.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.120
I'm serious about the whole
compression-pantyhose thing.

20:28.138 --> 20:29.881
I could totally
pick you up a pair.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.352
I mean, do I relish the prospect of being
seen skulking around the pantyhose aisle?

20:33.368 --> 20:35.791
No. But I'm sure you
don't want varicose veins.

20:35.807 --> 20:38.553
- I don't want pantyhose!
- Oh. Okay.

20:38.567 --> 20:41.573
I have decided I will make a chart.
I need a piece of paper,

20:41.585 --> 20:43.401
a ruler,
and some magic markers.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.340
I'm serious, mama.
I don't need --

20:46.186 --> 20:48.430
- What is that?
- Oh, it's the crib we ordered.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.452
Isn't it cool?
It'll be big enough for both of them.

20:50.487 --> 20:51.663
Where are my drums?

20:51.678 --> 20:53.833
They're good, they're safe.
We put them in the closet.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.521
The closet?
You put my drum kit in the closet?

20:56.535 --> 21:00.580
Yeah, we needed the space, and, Lane,
we haven't had band practice for months.

21:06.578 --> 21:08.411
We need to have band practice!

21:08.427 --> 21:10.080
Sure. And we will.

21:10.098 --> 21:10.721
Now.

21:10.735 --> 21:13.152
Well, if you want,
we can call Gil and Brian,

21:13.168 --> 21:15.442
but I mean, can you even play?

21:15.458 --> 21:17.933
What do you mean, can I play?

21:17.946 --> 21:20.163
I mean, in your condition.

21:20.178 --> 21:21.610
I can play.

21:21.627 --> 21:22.880
Okay.

21:22.898 --> 21:24.333
Cool.

21:29.197 --> 21:32.530
I melted three entire candy canes into
this not-very-large cup of coffee,

21:32.546 --> 21:34.653
- and still I can barely taste it.
- I know.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.740
It's just the vaguest
whisper of peppermint.

21:36.757 --> 21:37.602
Peppermint.

21:37.616 --> 21:40.910
I swear, I could get the same
effect if I put vaporub on my chest

21:40.926 --> 21:42.130
and drank coffee
at the same time.

21:42.167 --> 21:42.922
Peppermint.

21:42.935 --> 21:46.702
I mean, how arbitrary is it to decide
to stop serving candy-cane coffee

21:46.717 --> 21:48.473
the day after Christmas?

21:48.488 --> 21:50.903
Christmas spirit is not
something that can be turned off

21:50.916 --> 21:53.101
like a faucet on december 26th.

21:53.116 --> 21:54.191
Yeah, it stinks.

21:54.206 --> 21:57.502
On the plus side, any chest congestion
I had is now totally cleared up.

21:57.518 --> 21:58.291
Well, that's good.

21:58.308 --> 21:59.812
Well, let's
go Christmas-shopping.

21:59.826 --> 22:01.901
- Write your letter.
- I can't. I need a treat.

22:01.916 --> 22:04.550
This was your treat. Coming to Weston's
was supposed to buck up your spirits.

22:04.586 --> 22:05.803
and inspire your writing.

22:05.818 --> 22:08.760
No, candy-cane coffee was
supposed to be my treat.

22:08.777 --> 22:10.473
This coffee is no treat.

22:10.486 --> 22:12.941
Let's face it --
this is un-candy-cane-coffee coffee,

22:12.956 --> 22:14.552
and it's totally
un-bucking up my spirits.

22:14.587 --> 22:15.893
So it's decided --
let's go shopping.

22:15.927 --> 22:17.111
Write.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.000
Rory, I can't.

22:19.018 --> 22:21.192
Ooh. I have an idea. Excuse me.

22:21.217 --> 22:23.073
Hi. Merry Christmas.

22:23.088 --> 22:24.133
Christmas is over.

22:24.148 --> 22:25.553
Okay. Sue -- pretty name.

22:25.567 --> 22:29.272
I have a hunch that there's some of
the secret candy-cane-coffee mix

22:29.286 --> 22:30.931
just sitting in the back there,

22:30.945 --> 22:33.032
and I wonder if I could
make it worth your while

22:33.046 --> 22:35.172
if you and I could come to
some sort of arrangement.

22:35.186 --> 22:38.820
Like I said before, we stop selling
candy-cane coffee when Christmas is over.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.940
Right. I'm not talking
about selling it.

22:40.957 --> 22:44.161
I'm talking about maybe if you
misplaced a canister or two.

22:44.177 --> 22:46.701
- Misplaced?
- Misplaced.

22:46.987 --> 22:48.352
- Honey.
- Yes?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.560
- Christmas is over.
- Okay.

22:52.586 --> 22:54.613
- Are we gonna talk about this?
- About what?

22:54.628 --> 22:56.983
- Why are you lying to dad?
- I'm not lying.

22:56.998 --> 22:59.443
He walked into the kitchen earlier,
and you all of a sudden

22:59.457 --> 23:02.283
started prattling on about
popcorn and cranberries.

23:02.297 --> 23:05.592
I wasn't prattling.
Come on, let's blow this popsicle stand.

23:07.567 --> 23:10.332
But you're not telling him about this
character-reference thing, are you?

23:10.367 --> 23:12.173
- I haven't yet.
- And you're not planning to.

23:12.185 --> 23:15.620
You're intentionally not telling him.
That's kind of a lie of omission.

23:15.638 --> 23:18.223
A Lie of Omission ? Isn't that an
Ashley Judd/Morgan Freeman movie?

23:18.258 --> 23:21.103
Look mom, if there's anything to be
learned from this whole thing with Lucy,

23:21.135 --> 23:22.981
it's that honesty
is the best policy.

23:22.998 --> 23:24.621
It's an okay policy.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.310
But how do you expect to have
any kind of relationship

23:26.346 --> 23:27.711
if you're not honest with him?

23:27.725 --> 23:30.371
Honey, look,
I have been around a long time, okay?

23:30.385 --> 23:32.141
I wore leggings the last
time they were trendy.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.742
I knew Tom Hanks when he was a bosom
buddy. I have lived, and I have learned.

23:34.778 --> 23:35.373
I know.

23:35.388 --> 23:38.461
And I understand that you value honesty,
and I applaud that value.

23:38.475 --> 23:41.262
But sometimes the truth is
a little more complicated.

23:41.276 --> 23:42.551
More complicated how?

23:42.565 --> 23:45.101
More complicated.
We don't have to talk about this.

23:45.118 --> 23:47.950
I know, but I want you to
tell me what's going on.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.141
Things with dad are great.
They're better than great.

23:51.158 --> 23:52.872
It's just that...

23:52.888 --> 23:53.723
What?

23:53.738 --> 23:56.143
He's been a bit on
edge about Luke.

23:56.156 --> 23:58.311
You know, I ran into Luke
outside Doose's the other day,

23:58.348 --> 24:00.990
and dad saw me
holding Liz's baby.

24:01.005 --> 24:03.223
And it just wasn't great.
It wasn't great timing.

24:03.378 --> 24:08.293
And this whole mom having the
not-a-wedding-party thing caused tension,

24:08.307 --> 24:09.560
and we argued.

24:09.576 --> 24:11.901
So I just want to be
sensitive and not worry him

24:11.918 --> 24:13.693
about something he doesn't
need to worry about.

24:13.727 --> 24:15.041
Well, that makes sense.

24:15.058 --> 24:18.032
But everything is
gonna be fine.

24:18.048 --> 24:19.642
Better than fine --
it's gonna be great.

24:19.795 --> 24:20.692
Okay.

24:20.798 --> 24:23.650
Well, you know, mom,
I've been around for a while, too.

24:23.668 --> 24:26.211
I remember Tom Hanks from his
"Joe versus the volcano" days.

24:26.226 --> 24:27.393
Yeah, you were like 5.

24:27.408 --> 24:29.323
Yeah, but the point is,
I'm not a kid anymore.

24:29.338 --> 24:31.951
You don't have to create this
whole Christmas illusion

24:31.968 --> 24:34.530
where everything in the
world is magical and fine.

24:34.548 --> 24:36.061
It's okay if it's not.

24:36.078 --> 24:37.900
You still believe in Santa,
though, right?

24:37.915 --> 24:40.161
Your best dry-cleaning client?
Of course.

24:41.757 --> 24:45.823
A little to the right. Okay. Too far.
A little to the left. There.

24:45.838 --> 24:46.861
- How's that?
- Good.

24:46.878 --> 24:48.113
It really livens
up your apartment.

24:48.145 --> 24:50.743
It's a very lively mask.
Thanks again, April.

24:50.758 --> 24:52.222
I love it. I really do.

24:52.237 --> 24:53.761
It's based on my real face.

24:53.775 --> 24:54.633
Oh, yeah?

24:54.646 --> 24:56.451
Not the outside,
but the inside.

24:56.467 --> 24:59.272
I made it in art class, and I had
to lie still with straws up my nose

24:59.287 --> 25:01.080
while a partner put
plaster strips on my face.

25:01.116 --> 25:03.560
- Straws on your nose, huh?
- I suffer for my art.

25:03.578 --> 25:06.480
Anyway, this kid Evan,
he got Liz Alderman as a partner,

25:06.496 --> 25:09.881
who's a total wild child. And she laid
the plaster strips all willy-nilly

25:09.898 --> 25:12.090
and ended up pulling
off half his eyebrows.

25:12.107 --> 25:13.532
Oh, that's not good.

25:13.548 --> 25:15.762
Actually, Liz Alderman's
on my swim team now.

25:15.778 --> 25:16.733
Oh yeah?

25:16.746 --> 25:19.232
She's got these really huge feet,
which coach Bennett finds promising.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.150
- Like built-in flippers.
- Exactly.

25:21.166 --> 25:24.133
Hopefully they kick in -- no pun intended
-- before our big swim meet in may.

25:24.165 --> 25:26.301
- May, huh?
- May 15th.

25:26.315 --> 25:29.062
10 different clubs are sending teams.
It's gonna be amazing.

25:29.077 --> 25:31.672
I hear they have really great
swim teams in New Mexico.

25:31.686 --> 25:35.240
Yeah, right.
New Mexico is a barren, dusty desert,

25:35.256 --> 25:37.491
and they probably don't
even have water to swim in.

25:37.508 --> 25:40.322
In hot climates,
they actually have more swimming pools.

25:40.335 --> 25:42.650
I bet you a lot of kids there
will be really into swimming.

25:42.686 --> 25:44.122
Then they're probably
too good for me.

25:44.157 --> 25:45.942
I mean, the only reason I
get to do so many events

25:45.978 --> 25:48.030
is 'cause everyone on my
team stinks worse than I do.

25:48.067 --> 25:49.591
- April!
- It's true.

25:49.608 --> 25:50.990
Go on.

25:51.107 --> 25:54.262
All right, go ahead and open
up your Christmas present.

25:54.275 --> 25:57.552
Are you trying to bribe me out of a bad
mood with the offer of material goods?

25:57.566 --> 25:59.291
'Cause I'm amenable to that.

26:04.066 --> 26:07.242
Wow! A rock polisher!

26:07.255 --> 26:09.112
- Thanks so much.
- You like it?

26:09.128 --> 26:11.742
- It's the perfect present.
- You hinted at it pretty hard,

26:11.757 --> 26:13.213
so I figured it might
be the right thing.

26:13.246 --> 26:14.972
It is. It is.

26:15.455 --> 26:19.192
But, dad, I kind of already got
a rock polisher from grandma.

26:19.207 --> 26:21.391
Oh. Well,
then it's not the perfect present.

26:21.408 --> 26:22.583
No, it is. It is.

26:22.595 --> 26:24.923
This one looks more powerful
than the one I already have.

26:24.937 --> 26:27.061
Plus, I mean,
who couldn't use two rock polishers?

26:27.075 --> 26:28.211
- Yeah?
- Sure.

26:28.226 --> 26:29.762
You should see my rock
collection right now.

04:26:29.790 --> 26:32.575
It's insane. I've practically
got a quarry in my bedroom --

26:32.585 --> 26:36.722
granite, of course, but also feldspar,
quartz, mica, limestone.

26:36.737 --> 26:38.112
- Cool.
- I know.

26:38.125 --> 26:41.190
I've been biking over to Beacon Falls and
going rock-hunting around Naugatuck River.

26:41.228 --> 26:42.392
It's amazing.

26:42.405 --> 26:44.910
The other day, I found an arrowhead
in almost perfect condition.

26:44.947 --> 26:47.790
It's so sharp, I think I'd get in
trouble if I brought it to school.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.342
You know, if you're interested
in arrowheads, New Mexico has

26:50.357 --> 26:52.160
- some incredible places --
- Dad.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.192
Okay. Okay.

26:55.296 --> 26:56.833
Let's open this thing.

26:58.567 --> 27:00.390
Hey! I'm done with the lights.

27:00.406 --> 27:02.550
Do you want to see them now,
or you want to wait till after dark?

27:02.588 --> 27:05.913
Uh, I will wait --
to get the full effect.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.213
What you got there?

27:07.228 --> 27:10.242
Uh, nothing.
Just some of Santa's secret stuff.

27:10.256 --> 27:11.812
Oh, yeah? What did you get me?

27:11.825 --> 27:13.960
- A Maserati.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

27:13.977 --> 27:16.320
It's amazing how a Maserati can
fit behind the bed like that.

27:16.355 --> 27:18.220
I haven't put it together yet,
which reminds me --

27:18.255 --> 27:19.691
do you have any masking
tape I can borrow?

27:19.728 --> 27:21.843
You're gonna assemble the
Maserati with masking tape?

27:21.855 --> 27:24.661
Don't ask questions! Get out of here.
It's Santa's workshop!

27:27.705 --> 27:28.991
Rory!

27:29.387 --> 27:30.973
We have to go shopping,

27:30.986 --> 27:32.961
get your dad a Maserati!

27:36.928 --> 27:39.752
So of course I spun the record
for like a week straight,

27:39.766 --> 27:42.021
because who wouldn't want to listen
to art brut for a week straight?

27:42.055 --> 27:43.413
Pass me your lyrics.

27:43.425 --> 27:45.510
Yeah. Here they are.

27:45.556 --> 27:48.881
As far as I'm concerned, "formed a
band" could be the new national anthem.

27:48.898 --> 27:52.412
I swear I could literally stand
and cover my heart if asked.

27:53.397 --> 27:54.591
Brian?

27:54.877 --> 27:56.122
Brian?

27:57.807 --> 27:59.022
Whoa!

27:59.165 --> 28:00.872
What's going on here, babe?
Everything okay?

04:28:00.908 --> 28:02.509
You got to watch
the loud noises.

28:02.516 --> 28:05.672
Loud noises?
We're about to play rock music, Zach.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.390
Oh, check out the mandolin.

28:08.406 --> 28:10.081
Yeah, right.
She's a beaut, huh?

28:10.097 --> 28:12.273
Yeah. Cool.
What kind of stuff you been working on?

28:12.287 --> 28:13.862
Mostly I've just
been messing around.

28:13.875 --> 28:16.243
I wrote one song that was kind
of White Stripes' "Little Ghost"

28:16.278 --> 28:18.772
meets The Decemberists
meets Gulag Orkestar

28:18.786 --> 28:20.482
meets, like,
"Losing my religion"

28:20.495 --> 28:22.572
meets Jethro Burns on
that Steve Goodman album

28:22.588 --> 28:24.573
meets "Battle of
Evermore" meets the Smiths

28:24.587 --> 28:27.282
meets... some other stuff.

28:27.298 --> 28:29.812
- That's lot of meeting.
- Exactly.

28:30.046 --> 28:33.270
Whoa. Okay, this is eerie.

28:33.288 --> 28:35.642
You see the way I'm
holding my mandolin.

28:35.656 --> 28:37.540
It's exactly one of the
baby holds I've learned.

28:37.578 --> 28:40.553
See how I have it in the crook of
my arm with its head supported?

28:40.626 --> 28:41.921
That's how you're
supposed to hold a baby?

28:41.958 --> 28:44.431
One of the ways.
Man, Lane, I wish your mom was here.

28:44.447 --> 28:46.863
This is so totally
"rock-a-bye, baby."

28:46.877 --> 28:47.841
Fascinating.

28:47.857 --> 28:50.893
So wait, there are different
ways to officially hold a baby?

28:50.906 --> 28:53.383
Yeah, sure --
you got your "hello, world,"

28:53.395 --> 28:55.213
where you put the baby's
back to your stomach

28:55.225 --> 28:57.192
and put your hand
under here for support.

28:57.207 --> 28:58.550
You got your belly hold,

28:58.565 --> 29:01.883
where you put the baby's chest
down along one of your forearms.

29:01.896 --> 29:03.862
This is really great
for gassy babies.

29:03.878 --> 29:06.121
Then you got your fruit basket,
which is --

29:06.137 --> 29:07.422
Finally.

29:10.486 --> 29:13.522
Hey, hey, hey! How we doing?

29:13.538 --> 29:14.811
Long time no see.

29:14.826 --> 29:17.352
- Gil, how's it hangin'?
- It's hangin' great, my friend.

29:17.366 --> 29:21.411
So, check it out. This is the
youngest of my brood -- Macon.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.523
Macon, this is the band.

29:23.537 --> 29:24.472
What up?

29:24.488 --> 29:27.450
The sitter flaked,
and I got Macon the bacon under my wing.

29:27.466 --> 29:28.133
That's cool.

29:28.146 --> 29:30.160
Sorry for the short notice,
but I figured you guys would be

29:30.197 --> 29:33.952
a little more understanding being
that you're in the family way.

29:34.256 --> 29:36.151
Speaking of which...

29:36.168 --> 29:37.860
Whoa! Check you out, Lane.

29:37.876 --> 29:40.961
You are some kind of
serious fertility goddess.

29:40.976 --> 29:41.871
Thanks.

29:41.885 --> 29:43.722
Zach, nice work, man.

29:43.735 --> 29:47.070
So, I thought we should warm up by
practicing some of our old songs.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.920
And then maybe Zach could show us what
he's been doing with the mandolin.

29:49.957 --> 29:51.370
The mandolin.

29:53.235 --> 29:54.450
Right on.

29:54.466 --> 29:57.053
Oh, man!
You got the Alcmere 3000!

29:57.067 --> 29:59.162
- The what?
- The breast pump.

29:59.178 --> 30:02.283
I'm psyched you guys picked this one.
It's really gentle.

30:02.295 --> 30:04.302
I mean,
my wife's got sensitive nipples.

30:04.317 --> 30:06.302
This one didn't
bum her out at all.

30:06.316 --> 30:09.102
- You use that to pump...
- Milk. Sure.

30:09.115 --> 30:11.391
That's if you choose to go
the breast-feeding route.

30:11.406 --> 30:13.973
You guys, I'm sure Brian
is not interested in this.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.120
Breast-feeding, huh?

30:15.138 --> 30:17.521
Yeah. I mean,
some people go with the formula deal,

30:17.537 --> 30:18.923
which is cool, too.

30:18.937 --> 30:21.323
Actually, for baby number two,
we did use formula.

30:21.335 --> 30:22.052
Yeah?

30:22.067 --> 30:25.763
I mean, if you use formula,
the old lady can smoke, drink,

30:25.775 --> 30:29.221
eat as many tacos as she wants --
no problemo.

30:29.237 --> 30:30.440
You hear that, babe?

30:30.456 --> 30:32.833
Yeah. Tacos. Thrilling.

30:32.847 --> 30:35.030
Why can't they make books
out of something lighter?

30:35.045 --> 30:35.973
Lighter than paper?

30:35.987 --> 30:37.501
I'm being punished
for being generous.

30:37.515 --> 30:39.471
That's what you get for
having so many smart friends.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.141
So I think we're doing well.

30:41.156 --> 30:42.173
Yeah, I think we're done.

30:42.186 --> 30:43.883
Oh wait, Babette.
Do we have something for Babette?

30:43.918 --> 30:45.721
The needlepoint pillow
with the sassy saying.

30:45.736 --> 30:48.801
Oh yeah.
Hey, you know, it's kind of impressive

30:48.816 --> 30:50.921
when people curse
in needlepoint.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.271
There's something
laborious about it.

30:52.305 --> 30:55.083
And I got cologne for Michel and
the same cologne for my mother.

30:55.095 --> 30:55.713
Weird.

30:55.725 --> 30:57.002
Well, they'll both hate
whatever I give them,

30:57.036 --> 30:59.382
so I figured,
why spend time picking out doomed gifts?

30:59.395 --> 31:02.550
Then I have whatever Williams-Sonoma
sold me for Sookie --

31:02.566 --> 31:05.901
a butter slicer,
a bread warmer/wine maker.

31:05.918 --> 31:07.682
Well, I'm sure she'll
love her butter slicer.

31:07.716 --> 31:11.030
If that's even what it is. I swear, they
could attach a stone to a piece of string

31:11.048 --> 31:13.322
and call it a poultry pounder,
and I'd shell out 35 bucks.

31:13.356 --> 31:15.140
So I guess all we need is dad.

31:15.156 --> 31:17.012
I really want to get
him something great.

31:17.026 --> 31:18.053
We have the sweater.

31:18.067 --> 31:19.441
And the really heavy book.

31:19.458 --> 31:22.633
But I want to get him something
that he'll really love.

31:22.645 --> 31:24.690
Well, we will.
I mean, we'll find something.

31:24.705 --> 31:27.861
We have a whole mall here full of
post-Christmas prices. We'll find something.

31:27.876 --> 31:29.853
Guys are tricky,
but your dad's really tricky.

31:29.867 --> 31:31.921
What does he need?
What does he want?

31:31.937 --> 31:33.271
Perhaps a poultry pounder.

31:33.286 --> 31:34.883
Plus, he is my husband now.

31:34.897 --> 31:36.400
I've never bought
something for a husband.

31:36.437 --> 31:38.712
I wish they had a special
store for husband stuff.

31:38.728 --> 31:40.010
Hey!

31:41.307 --> 31:42.380
What do you think?

31:42.395 --> 31:43.353
Maybe.

31:43.365 --> 31:44.923
I think he'd love it. Come on.

31:45.766 --> 31:48.212
Oh, look at this one.

31:49.398 --> 31:51.403
Doesn't work so good
inside, though.

31:51.416 --> 31:53.211
Solar systems, 50% off!

31:53.228 --> 31:55.712
That's not just a post-Christmas sale.
That's a post-Pluto sale.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.980
- Poor Pluto.
- Oh, poor Pluto.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.610
Hey, um, it's Luke.

32:04.397 --> 32:05.431
Hi.

32:06.075 --> 32:08.431
- I guess we should...
- Yeah.

32:10.457 --> 32:11.923
- Oh! Hey!
- Hey.

32:11.936 --> 32:14.170
- Hey, Rory.
- Hey, Luke. Hey, April.

32:14.186 --> 32:15.222
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.591
- Hi.
- Hi, April.

32:16.605 --> 32:17.772
Hi.

32:17.815 --> 32:21.500
April showed up at the
diner today out of the blue.

32:21.516 --> 32:23.353
You make it sound like
Pearl Harbor or something.

32:23.385 --> 32:26.752
No, I mean, it was a surprise --
a nice surprise.

32:26.766 --> 32:28.202
So, how's it going?

32:28.218 --> 32:30.782
- It's -- I'm almost done.
- Done?

32:30.875 --> 32:32.733
You're not talking
about the letter.

32:32.746 --> 32:34.242
You're just asking in general.

32:34.255 --> 32:35.332
I meant, how's it going?

32:35.347 --> 32:37.442
Good. I'm good. We're good.

32:37.487 --> 32:39.801
Hey, I like your sweaters.
They're very festive.

32:39.815 --> 32:41.613
Thank you.
It's Christmas for us.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.022
Rory was in London at
the end of december,

32:43.057 --> 32:44.681
so we waited to do
Christmas together.

32:44.696 --> 32:45.771
Of course you did.

32:45.788 --> 32:48.203
- Sir, do you have a return?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.322
So, April,
how was your Christmas?

32:51.337 --> 32:54.832
Well, I'm 60% atheist
and 40% agnostic,

32:54.847 --> 32:56.862
so Christmas isn't really
a big deal for me.

32:56.878 --> 32:58.532
Oh, really? 60/40, huh?

32:58.547 --> 33:00.661
- More of a winter solstice gal?
- Exactly.

33:00.678 --> 33:02.731
You went to London by
yourself over Christmas?

33:02.746 --> 33:05.100
Oh, I wasn't exactly by myself.
I met my boyfriend there.

33:05.117 --> 33:08.360
Oh. Meeting a lover in a foreign city --
how glamorous.

33:08.378 --> 33:10.033
I can't wait to be
grown up and glamorous

33:10.048 --> 33:13.123
and be able to make my own
decisions about where I go and when.

33:13.136 --> 33:14.650
Being a kid is the
pits sometimes.

33:14.666 --> 33:15.983
It sure is.

33:16.266 --> 33:17.580
Oh, thanks.

33:17.975 --> 33:19.301
What'd you get?

33:19.318 --> 33:22.542
Well, my dad got me the greatest
present ever -- a rock-polishing kit --

33:22.557 --> 33:25.211
but I had already gotten
it from my grandma,

33:25.227 --> 33:27.200
who's very into Christmas.

33:27.215 --> 33:30.141
So we exchanged it
for this microscope,

33:30.158 --> 33:31.753
which is also the
greatest present.

33:31.768 --> 33:33.363
- Good.
- Wow. That's great.

33:33.378 --> 33:35.030
My dad's always been
a great gift giver.

33:35.045 --> 33:37.251
I guess I don't know if I
was always considered so good

33:37.266 --> 33:39.380
at picking out presents,
right, Rory?

33:39.395 --> 33:41.443
Oh, no,
you've always been great.

33:41.455 --> 33:43.091
- Towels?
- What towels.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.353
- You meant well.
- You gave her towels?

33:45.365 --> 33:46.312
For my birthday.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.442
I had them monogrammed.
I thought it was cool.

33:48.457 --> 33:50.620
Yes, you went through quite
the monogramming phase.

33:50.638 --> 33:53.791
I believe you received monogrammed
pencils, a monogrammed mug,

33:53.806 --> 33:56.230
a monogrammed backpack,
and a monogrammed belt.

33:56.246 --> 33:58.861
No one ever tried to steal that belt.
Those were my favorite towels.

33:58.896 --> 34:00.031
I still have the washcloth.

34:00.047 --> 34:01.270
That's hilarious.

34:01.285 --> 34:03.730
Remember the year you got me the
unicorn marionette with the purple horn?

34:03.765 --> 34:05.340
You didn't like the
unicorn marionette?

34:05.356 --> 34:07.342
I've never really been
that into unicorns.

34:07.358 --> 34:08.543
I thought you loved that.

34:08.556 --> 34:10.010
I know,
because I was being polite.

34:10.025 --> 34:11.389
Being polite can be dangerous.

34:11.406 --> 34:13.150
Yes, it totally backfired,

34:13.167 --> 34:16.203
because for the next five years,
I only got unicorn items --

34:16.216 --> 34:18.822
unicorn sweatshirt,
unicorn pencil case,

34:18.838 --> 34:21.090
bumper sticker --
"I brake for unicorns."

34:21.107 --> 34:23.533
You were always so nice.
You never forgot my birthday.

34:23.545 --> 34:26.013
And every holiday,
there was a monogrammed unicorn item.

34:26.025 --> 34:28.460
Dad, for the record,
I'm not really into unicorns, either.

34:28.475 --> 34:30.610
Well, I'm glad to know it.
Anyway, we should get going.

34:30.647 --> 34:32.040
I got to get you home, kiddo.

34:32.056 --> 34:34.429
Well, we have to buy up
all the Pluto stuff.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.800
It's really gonna be
a collector's item.

34:35.837 --> 34:36.723
Sure.

34:36.737 --> 34:38.830
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye. Have a merry Christmas.

34:38.848 --> 34:40.152
Merry Christmas.

34:47.514 --> 34:48.710
Honey, let me carry that.

34:48.728 --> 34:50.050
- No, thank you.
- Lane, come on.

34:50.067 --> 34:51.873
I'm perfectly capable of
carrying a bag of groceries.

34:51.906 --> 34:54.513
Nutter butters? I put those
nutter butters back on the shelf.

34:54.527 --> 34:55.801
I took them off of the shelf.

34:55.818 --> 34:57.890
Your mom doesn't think you
should be eating many cookies.

34:57.925 --> 35:00.592
Enough about my mom, okay?
Enough. I'm so sick of her.

35:00.607 --> 35:03.310
She's been pretty great, Lane.
She cooks for us, cleans for us.

35:03.327 --> 35:05.082
She's a total fount
of baby information.

35:05.098 --> 35:07.103
You know what? Maybe you should
have married my mom, then, okay?

35:07.138 --> 35:09.120
Well, I'm sure when
your mom was younger...

35:09.135 --> 35:11.760
Hey, I'm just saying,
she's a handsome woman.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.720
What? I'm just saying that
I bet when she was younger,

35:13.758 --> 35:15.260
she used to look a
little like you --

35:15.277 --> 35:18.111
shorter hair, no glasses,
maybe a bit more crabby. Maybe.

35:18.128 --> 35:19.523
Well, I'm sick of her.

35:19.535 --> 35:21.321
- That's kind of harsh.
- I am. I'm sick oh her.

35:21.356 --> 35:23.811
I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of
being treated like I'm not a person,

35:23.846 --> 35:26.852
like I'm some incubator whose
puffy ankles and varicose veins

35:26.865 --> 35:28.781
and bathroom habits
are up for discussion.

35:28.796 --> 35:30.893
On what planet is it
appropriate to ask a person

35:30.908 --> 35:32.470
how many times a
day she urinates?

35:32.485 --> 35:34.340
- You can ask me.
- I don't want to ask you.

35:34.355 --> 35:36.780
Six times today so far.
I had a lot of coffee.

35:36.796 --> 35:39.290
I'm sick of being told what
to eat and what I shouldn't

35:39.307 --> 35:41.431
and what side I should
sleep on when I lie down.

35:41.447 --> 35:43.440
I'm a person, Zach.
I'm an adult.

35:43.455 --> 35:45.190
I don't want to be hiding
things under the floorboards

35:45.228 --> 35:46.450
and behind cushions again.

35:46.467 --> 35:48.910
Yeah, that's no good. Plus,
we're starting to get ants and mites.

35:48.946 --> 35:50.510
I don't want
everything to change

35:50.526 --> 35:51.930
just because we're
having these babies.

35:51.967 --> 35:54.431
But things are going to change.
There's no getting around it.

35:54.445 --> 35:57.250
Really, really soon,
we're gonna have two babies --

35:57.265 --> 35:58.693
two alive human sons.

35:58.705 --> 36:00.412
It was such a small window --

36:00.427 --> 36:02.360
a peephole, really.

36:02.376 --> 36:04.211
For years,
I was this repressed kid,

36:04.226 --> 36:07.402
and then there was the
briefest of windows.

36:07.416 --> 36:09.062
And then -- slam.

36:09.076 --> 36:12.042
All of a sudden,
I'm this overburdened mother.

36:12.057 --> 36:13.920
I barely got to do it, Zach.

36:13.945 --> 36:15.810
I barely got the
chance to be a person.

36:15.825 --> 36:18.662
No, no, you can still be a person
and still be rock 'n' roll.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.762
Having babies doesn't mean
you can't be rock 'n' roll.

36:20.798 --> 36:21.780
I don't know.

36:21.797 --> 36:24.471
Give me a break. Sonic Youth has a kid,
and they're still way cool.

36:24.478 --> 36:25.270
Yeah.

36:25.286 --> 36:27.341
And Mick Jagger --
that cat has like 15 kids,

36:27.355 --> 36:28.730
and he still goes
out and rocks.

36:28.746 --> 36:29.651
Yeah, I guess.

36:29.668 --> 36:32.820
For sure, the man rocks hard,
and then he makes another kid.

36:32.836 --> 36:34.862
I don't want to make
any other kids ever.

36:34.878 --> 36:37.293
All I'm saying is,
we can still go out and play.

36:37.558 --> 36:40.572
That's one of the cool things
about having your mother around --

36:40.587 --> 36:42.753
- built-in babysitter.
- Yeah.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.281
I just don't think I can bear
having her around all the time.

36:45.317 --> 36:47.940
What about weekends? What if she
hung out with us on the weekends

36:47.956 --> 36:49.713
and spent the week
back at her pad?

36:49.728 --> 36:51.941
Yeah, I guess that'd
be all right.

36:52.385 --> 36:54.483
Let me carry that bag for you.

37:04.728 --> 37:06.901
I had such a good
time with you today.

37:06.917 --> 37:09.173
I was thinking that
tuesdays after school,

37:09.187 --> 37:10.751
I could tell mom that
I have chess club.

37:10.788 --> 37:12.793
And I really only have
chess club once a week,

37:12.805 --> 37:14.421
but I could pretend
it's twice a week.

37:14.437 --> 37:17.240
And so as soon as school's over,
I could bike halfway to Stars Hollow,

37:17.255 --> 37:18.841
and you could meet me.
I could hide in the bushes

37:18.878 --> 37:22.120
and do prearranged bird calls,
like a mourning dove or something --

37:22.335 --> 37:27.122
A "coo-roo coo-roo
coo-roo" as a signal.

37:27.137 --> 37:29.211
Yeah, I don't think so.

37:29.225 --> 37:30.700
I don't need to do
the bird calls.

37:30.717 --> 37:33.050
It wouldn't be right, April.
It woudn't.

37:33.066 --> 37:34.693
We can't lie to your mother.

37:34.705 --> 37:38.891
Your mother and I are not totally
seeing eye to eye on certain things,

37:38.905 --> 37:41.562
and so we're sort
of in negotiations

37:41.576 --> 37:45.932
to figure out how to share our
parenting responsibilities.

37:45.948 --> 37:47.520
Do you have a good lawyer?

37:47.627 --> 37:50.531
You better have a good one,
'cause mom hired a shark.

37:50.545 --> 37:53.181
We're gonna figure that out.
Don't worry about it, okay?

37:53.195 --> 37:55.753
But the court case is the reason
that it's really important

37:55.765 --> 37:58.921
that we do everything
honestly and aboveboard.

37:58.937 --> 38:00.912
Yeah. I guess that makes sense.

38:00.928 --> 38:05.130
Okay. So...
what should we do with the microscope?

38:05.147 --> 38:06.020
Keep it.

38:06.035 --> 38:08.260
I'll use it the next
time I'm over -- soon.

38:08.277 --> 38:09.301
Okay.

38:09.318 --> 38:10.800
You can set it up if you want.

38:10.816 --> 38:13.820
Just make sure that you
always remove the slide

38:13.838 --> 38:16.473
before you rotate the lenses,
or you can grind things up.

38:16.488 --> 38:18.671
And always carry it with
a hand under the base.

38:18.687 --> 38:20.241
I'll be very careful.

38:25.568 --> 38:27.080
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:33.938 --> 38:36.040
Don't forget to
put your helmet on.

38:51.778 --> 38:57.233
# I'll be home for Christmas #

38:58.437 --> 39:04.242
# You can plan on me #

39:05.496 --> 39:12.393
# Please have snow and mistletoe #

39:12.407 --> 39:20.290
# And presents on the tree #

39:21.905 --> 39:23.522
Look at this -- liquid sugar.

39:23.538 --> 39:25.381
It's good for you, this stuff.

39:25.425 --> 39:27.002
You think?

39:27.018 --> 39:29.011
You like the red or the green?

39:29.478 --> 39:32.763
Red? Red the best?
I like red, too.

39:33.715 --> 39:35.833
Little. Little.

39:35.846 --> 39:38.070
- That's dripping.
- That's dripping.

39:38.128 --> 39:39.503
You're making a mess, dad.

39:39.517 --> 39:42.550
I'm not very good
with the cookies.

39:42.568 --> 39:44.710
And what do we say
if anyone asks?

39:44.727 --> 39:48.372
We made cookies by scratching.

39:48.385 --> 39:50.102
"From scratch."

39:50.115 --> 39:51.591
From scratching.

39:51.607 --> 39:53.491
Well, let's hope nobody asks.

39:53.506 --> 39:55.100
Hey, G.G.,
you want to lick the beater?

39:55.115 --> 39:56.981
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

39:57.676 --> 39:59.033
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:59.045 --> 40:01.321
We're making some
cookies by scratching.

40:01.337 --> 40:03.961
That sounds appetizing. I'm gonna run
out for a sec. I'll be right back.

40:03.996 --> 40:06.591
Okay, hurry back. "Christmas in
july" screening in 30 minutes.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.861
Thought we'd start
a new tradition.

40:07.898 --> 40:09.242
Sounds good.

40:11.045 --> 40:12.861
G.G., I think we need
some of the colors.

40:12.877 --> 40:14.530
Can you put some
sprinkles on that one?

40:14.545 --> 40:16.233
You want to decorate that one?

40:22.856 --> 40:28.450
# Please have snow #

40:29.616 --> 40:33.531
# And mistletoe #

40:33.795 --> 40:44.010
# And presents on the tree #

40:45.396 --> 40:55.760
# Christmas Eve will find me #

40:56.188 --> 41:02.181
