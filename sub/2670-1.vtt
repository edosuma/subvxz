<I>COMMENTATOR 1: Welcome to Barcelona.</I>

01:07.464 --> 01:11.926
<I>Almost 100,000 people here
in the Nou Camp this evening.</I>

01:12.886 --> 01:15.846
<I>It really is an extraordinary atmosphere.</I>

01:21.019 --> 01:23.437
<I>COMMENTATOR 2: But you do wonder
is fate now taking a hand</I>

01:23.438 --> 01:25.481
<I>in Manchester United's destiny.</I>

01:25.482 --> 01:29.694
<I>They have made their own luck
with their boldness and their adventure,</I>

01:29.695 --> 01:35.116
<I>but they have had just enough luck
to stand here on the brink of history.</I>

01:36.159 --> 01:37.868
<I>It's the chance of a lifetime.</I>

01:38.787 --> 01:40.788
<I>A treble chance,</I>

01:40.789 --> 01:45.418
<I>the likes of which no English team
has had before, or may ever get again.</I>

QUEEN ELIZABETH III 1992

01:59.766 --> 02:05.980
<I>is not a year on which I shall look back
with undiluted pleasure.</I>

02:05.981 --> 02:08.065
<I>MALE REPORTER: One of
Manchester's busiest shopping streets,</I>

02:08.066 --> 02:10.067
<I>suddenly a living hell.</I>

02:10.068 --> 02:12.945
<I>A bomb planted in bushes
behind Kendals department store</I>

02:12.946 --> 02:15.823
<I>showered office workers with flying glass.</I>

02:15.824 --> 02:18.409
(CLAMOURING)

02:19.619 --> 02:22.121
FEMALE <I>PROTESTER: Smash the poll tax
and smash the Tories</I>

02:22.122 --> 02:26.167
<I>and in the end put an end
to this Tory government itself.</I>

02:36.928 --> 02:40.389
I've only got one thing to say,
it's nice to be back.

03:18.011 --> 03:19.136
<I>NEWS REPORTER: ll' is clear tonight</I>

03:19.137 --> 03:22.390
<I>that it is no longer a matter of whether,
but when there is a royal divorce.</I>

03:35.821 --> 03:38.614
NEWS <I>REPORTER: England's shattered
players arrived back at the hotel.</I>

03:38.615 --> 03:43.494
<I>A few hours later we once again saw
the dark face of English football.</I>

03:43.495 --> 03:47.832
<I>It has turned out to be
an annus horribilis.</I>

03:49.459 --> 03:51.085
ALEX FERGUSON: A club of this size,

03:51.086 --> 03:58.175
one would expect at the platform, the stage,
everything is geared to doing very, very well.

03:59.219 --> 04:02.531
And that very, very well
means winning the league.

04:02.532 --> 04:03.907
ERIC HARRISON:
I was a Man United supporter,

04:03.908 --> 04:07.161
<I>and it's extra special
when you get the coaching job there.</I>

04:07.162 --> 04:11.790
<I>When Sir Alex took over, everybody realised
that he wanted a vibrant youth system.</I>

04:11.791 --> 04:15.794
And he said to me straight out,
as typically Sir Alex does,

04:15.795 --> 04:19.589
he says, "I'm not entirely satisfied
with the youth system," you know.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.968
He'd only been there
probably a few weeks, or a month.

04:22.969 --> 04:25.262
<I>I said, "Well, you know, we've had
Norman Whiteside through,</I>

04:25.263 --> 04:26.722
<I>"and Mark Hughes through."</I>

04:26.723 --> 04:30.976
<I>And he looked at me with those steely eyes
and he said, "That's not enough."</I>

04:30.977 --> 04:35.105
I said, "Do you know how many local scouts
Manchester City have got,

04:35.106 --> 04:36.940
"and how many
Manchester United have got?"

04:36.941 --> 04:42.877
When I told him, he was staggered,
he was absolutely staggered.

04:42.878 --> 04:44.421
And I'm not exaggerating,

04:44.422 --> 04:48.925
within a month he trebled
the scouting system at Manchester United,

04:48.926 --> 05:29.215
and that's when we started
getting the players.

05:29.216 --> 05:33.386
<I>Nicky Butt, what an absolute warrior.
What a great player Nicky Butt was.</I>

05:33.387 --> 05:36.222
Another Bryan Robson. Without question.

05:36.223 --> 05:38.641
I think he nicknamed himself One Nut Butt.

05:38.642 --> 05:41.478
He used to just head-butt people
and knock 'em out, he said.

05:41.479 --> 05:44.314
<I>GARY</I> NEVILLE: <I>I think the lads were always a
bit nervous about giving Butty a nickname,</I>

05:44.315 --> 05:47.442
<I>'cause you didn't how he was going to
react, he might just give you a dig.</I>

05:47.443 --> 05:48.651
You just don't mess with him.

05:49.904 --> 05:52.489
RYAN GIGGS: <I>Scholesy was like the joker
that got away with it all the time.</I>

05:52.490 --> 05:54.324
<I>DAVID BECKHAM:
We kind of nicknamed him The Ghost.</I>

05:54.325 --> 05:56.659
<I>You know, he'd just disappear
at some point.</I>

05:56.660 --> 05:59.287
I know what Scholesy was like,
he was a little rascal.

05:59.288 --> 06:04.000
<I>And if somebody's underpants were missing,
I knew who it'd be. Paul Scholes.</I>

06:04.001 --> 06:07.003
<I>GARY:
You've got a kid who's smaller than most.</I>

06:07.004 --> 06:10.173
<I>He's got asthma. He's not the quickest,</I>

06:11.300 --> 06:14.344
but the best player I've ever played with.
Work that out.

06:18.390 --> 06:22.852
<I>BECKHAM: When I first saw Giggsy,
I just saw this really skinny kid.</I>

06:22.853 --> 06:24.437
PHIL NEVILLE: <I>There's no flashness to him.</I>

06:24.438 --> 06:28.566
He's probably the most down-to-earth
superstar I've ever met.

06:28.567 --> 06:31.069
NICKY BUTT: One minute he can be
the most serious man in the world,

06:31.070 --> 06:35.782
where he can be eye-balling somebody
and really deep-eye staring at somebody,

06:35.783 --> 06:38.535
and then next minute he can be
dancing on the table doing Elvis, so...

06:39.787 --> 06:43.081
GARY: <I>The thing that struck me early on
about Becks was his appearance.</I>

06:43.082 --> 06:45.625
<I>You thought,
"He's too pretty to be a football player."</I>

06:45.626 --> 06:47.043
<I>That was his nickname, "Pretty Boy".</I>

06:47.044 --> 06:49.379
<I>PAUL SCHOLES: You just think
he's a flash cockney.</I>

06:49.380 --> 06:51.756
<I>GIG-GS: I used to call him "Treacle".</I>

06:51.757 --> 06:54.884
"All right, Treacle." You know, and just...
That was his nickname.

06:54.885 --> 07:00.306
We still all know him,
I still see him in his red Escort Mexico.

07:00.307 --> 07:01.891
That's how I look at him.

07:03.435 --> 07:06.020
<I>GIGGS: "Busy Brothers",
"Busy One and Two",</I>

07:06.021 --> 07:07.730
<I>"Nervous Nevilles".</I>

07:07.731 --> 07:11.151
<I>SCHOLES: "Nervous Nevilles", yeah.
He was a bit jittery on the ball at times.</I>

07:11.152 --> 07:13.736
Gary and Phil could be. Not always, though.

07:14.822 --> 07:16.698
GARY: I think Freddie Flintoff
on interviews has said

07:16.699 --> 07:19.409
that the best day of his cricket career
was when Phil Neville retired,

07:19.410 --> 07:22.495
because he then became
the best all-rounder in Lancashire.

07:22.496 --> 07:25.456
He's just bubbly, he's always happy.

07:25.457 --> 07:27.625
Another difference from him and Gaz.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.130
<I>SCHOLES: Gary was the geek, wasn't he?</I>

07:32.131 --> 07:36.426
He was always sorting things out and everyone
just started calling him Busy and...

07:36.427 --> 07:39.345
Actually, Busy (BLEEP)
we always used to call him.

07:39.346 --> 07:40.930
(BUZZING)

07:40.931 --> 07:43.641
Everybody, the lads used to
walk past me going... (BUZZING)

07:47.730 --> 07:52.275
GARY: <I>I grew up in Bury.
Lived in</I> a <I>terraced house opposite</I> a <I>park.</I>

07:52.276 --> 07:54.360
All I remember about being a kid

07:54.361 --> 07:57.614
is playing football,
playing cricket at the cricket club.

07:57.615 --> 08:00.783
<I>And massively about
my dad taking me to United as a kid.</I>

08:00.784 --> 08:05.205
<I>I always remember the first time I went
and I was absolutely mesmerised.</I>

08:05.206 --> 08:07.332
You always thought
next year will be our year.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.959
"We'll win the league. We'll
win the league." We never did.

08:10.586 --> 08:12.962
<I>All I ever wanted to be was
a football player.</I>

08:12.963 --> 08:15.423
<I>And the only club I ever wanted
to play at was United.</I>

08:15.424 --> 08:19.135
And Gary was one of them lads that
when you know him, you love him to death,

08:19.136 --> 08:21.471
he's a great lad, everyone likes him.

08:21.472 --> 08:25.058
And when you don't know him he has
this persona of not being a nice person.

08:25.059 --> 08:26.809
I couldn't stand his
guts when I was younger.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.896
<I>And all I wanted to do was kick him
whenever I played against his local team.</I>

08:29.897 --> 08:34.734
Gary Neville was nowhere near as talented
technically as the other boys.

08:34.735 --> 08:35.860
And he won't mind me saying that.

08:35.861 --> 08:38.571
I always felt as though I had to work

08:39.198 --> 08:41.282
extra all the time.

08:41.283 --> 08:43.826
And just live and eat better
than anybody else.

08:43.827 --> 08:46.454
I've given up on it a little bit now.

08:47.331 --> 08:50.541
I made a conscious decision at 16,
when I left school,

08:50.542 --> 08:54.587
that I couldn't continue to see the friends
that I had been friends at school with,

08:54.588 --> 08:58.841
because I knew full well
I would get drawn into doing things

08:58.842 --> 09:01.803
that 16 to 18-year-old lads did,
and I couldn't do it.

09:01.804 --> 09:03.846
I couldn't do it. I
couldn't have any regrets.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.932
And he wanted to make himself a player.

09:05.933 --> 09:08.059
I didn't make him a player,
he made himself a player.

09:10.354 --> 09:14.607
<I>Eric Harrison was a massive influence
on me. He was just what I needed.</I>

09:14.608 --> 09:17.805
Took absolutely no (BLEEP).

09:17.806 --> 09:20.891
I remember my wife watching me one day,
because we were going to...

09:20.892 --> 09:24.019
She wanted to go to the Trafford Centre
after a training session.

09:24.020 --> 09:27.523
I got in the car, and she was sat in the
car, she said, "You're a disgrace."

09:27.524 --> 09:28.899
I said, "What do you mean?"

09:28.900 --> 09:31.902
She said, "You wouldn't do that
to your children, would you?"

09:31.903 --> 09:36.865
Eric has grounded them people, and he's put
into 'em morals and "treat people right".

09:36.866 --> 09:38.784
I think that if you're looking at Becks,

09:38.785 --> 09:41.453
probably one of the biggest
sports stars in the world,

09:41.454 --> 09:44.665
you know, and he's still grounded.
You know, we can thank Eric for that.

09:44.666 --> 09:48.126
You've got to make those demands
to be successful out there.

09:48.127 --> 09:52.089
Those who could cope with those demands
played, those who didn't...

09:52.090 --> 09:53.215
<I>And that's football.</I>

09:53.216 --> 09:56.093
<I>HARRISON: The one I was most disappointed
in was Raphael Burke.</I>

09:56.094 --> 09:59.179
Supremely talented player.
I wish he had have had that right attitude

09:59.180 --> 10:00.597
because he would have been
a first-team player.

10:01.391 --> 10:04.935
<I>BURKE: For me, I thought I was talented,
but I didn't dedicate like these guys.</I>

10:04.936 --> 10:08.230
When people say, "What was Becks like?"
Or, "What was Giggs like?"

10:08.231 --> 10:10.482
I say, "Well, the first
thing is they sacrificed."

10:10.483 --> 10:13.902
If you're gonna even have
a tiny chance of being like them,

10:13.903 --> 10:17.698
<I>if you don't practise or you don't
sacrifice, you haven't got a chance.</I>

10:17.699 --> 10:21.201
<I>HARRISON: I made Gary my youth-team
captain of the Class of '92.</I>

10:21.202 --> 10:23.453
And he was a fantastic captain.

10:23.454 --> 10:24.788
Gary was the leader,

10:24.789 --> 10:30.377
because if you saw Gary doing something
different on the pitch, after training,

10:30.378 --> 10:35.007
it had me thinking, "Well, if he's doing
it, I need to be doing something."

10:35.008 --> 10:36.633
You know, he was the captain of the team.

10:36.634 --> 10:39.970
<I>So he always took on the mantle
of looking after everyone.</I>

10:39.971 --> 10:43.307
I thought he was the glue
that held them lads together.

10:43.308 --> 10:46.935
Like our, I don't know, Uncle Gary, he is.
He does everything for us.

10:48.146 --> 10:49.563
It's just the way it is.

10:49.564 --> 10:53.984
We phone each other up now and again,
and I just go like that...

10:53.985 --> 10:55.611
"Have you finished yet?"

10:55.612 --> 10:59.990
Oh, dear me, he talks for England, he does,
you know. And Phil's not bad as well.

11:00.491 --> 11:03.285
Gaz and Phil would be, like,
throwing balls up at each other.

11:03.286 --> 11:06.246
<I>They'd be like, you know,
jogging on the spot.</I>

11:06.247 --> 11:09.416
<I>"Lads, relax, there's an hour to go
till kick-off yet. Relax."</I>

11:09.417 --> 11:12.419
<I>If you laid back, then you just sat there,
just looking at them,</I>

11:12.420 --> 11:14.504
<I>and just, "What you doing?"
"What are you doing?"</I>

11:14.505 --> 11:15.714
<I>And they were probably doing the same.</I>

11:15.715 --> 11:17.841
You can probably just imagine them
speaking to each other.

11:17.842 --> 11:20.344
"Phil, have you seen these?
It's cup final. Look at them.

11:20.345 --> 11:22.679
"They're not even prepared right.
We're prepared.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.681
"Are you prepared? Yeah, I'm prepared.

11:24.682 --> 11:27.100
"Yeah. Right. Well, we're prepared.
Never mind these."

11:27.101 --> 11:31.271
You know, you can just imagine it, that's
what they were like from an early age.

11:31.272 --> 11:34.775
They were just all about the focus,
and it worked.

11:39.989 --> 11:42.908
GIGGS: <I>I'd had two really bad experiences
in the Youth Cup.</I>

11:42.909 --> 11:45.369
I played as a schoolboy,
we got beat in the semi-final.

11:45.370 --> 11:49.206
<I>Played as a first-year apprentice,
and got knocked out in the semi-final.</I>

11:49.207 --> 11:51.249
So I was desperate to win it,
absolutely desperate,

11:51.250 --> 11:53.293
even though I'd played a few games
in the first team.

11:55.213 --> 11:59.549
The football was so good, I think.
It was just so enjoyable to play in that.

11:59.550 --> 12:02.052
We'd be winning four, five, six-nil
most weeks.

12:02.637 --> 12:05.138
<I>COMMENTATOR: And here's Ben Thornley.
Could go it all alone!</I>

12:05.890 --> 12:07.224
<I>He's scored!</I>

12:09.143 --> 12:12.229
<I>Switzer trying to get in behind
and there are people in the middle...</I>

12:12.230 --> 12:14.064
<I>And it could come to... It's Giggs!</I>

12:14.565 --> 12:17.776
One of the things that I remember
is Butty's overhead kick, you know.

12:20.863 --> 12:24.366
<I>Didn't go in, but he got
so excited about it.</I>

12:24.367 --> 12:27.661
There was only going to be one result
for this team, it was just...

12:27.662 --> 12:28.912
You just knew.

12:28.913 --> 12:31.248
(CHEERING)

12:36.421 --> 12:38.255
<I>HARRISON: And that was a really tough game.</I>

12:38.256 --> 12:41.258
But I mean, that was the biggest relief
I've ever had in my life,

12:41.259 --> 12:43.593
to come off that field
winners of the Youth Cup, you know,

12:43.594 --> 12:45.721
and see them lifting the Youth Cup.

12:45.722 --> 12:47.180
<I>It was sensational.</I>

12:47.181 --> 12:50.517
<I>COMMENTATOR: How many of these faces
will we ever see</I>

12:50.518 --> 12:52.352
<I>in a Manchester United first team?</I>

12:53.104 --> 12:54.354
<I>They hadn't won it for such a long time.</I>

12:54.355 --> 13:01.035
I think it was the Busby Babes
who won it last time, I think.

13:01.036 --> 13:02.953
BUTT: Went in the changing rooms
and the manager was there,

13:02.954 --> 13:05.622
the players were there,
the first-team players were there.

13:05.623 --> 13:07.041
All the staff was there.
Directors were there.

13:07.042 --> 13:09.626
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

13:09.627 --> 13:11.003
<I>BUTT: It was massive. It was huge.</I>

13:11.004 --> 13:14.840
And I put that medal alongside
every other medal that I've made.

13:14.841 --> 13:16.800
I wouldn't put it any higher,
I wouldn't put it any lower,

13:16.801 --> 13:19.386
it's on a par with every single medal
that I've ever won,

13:19.387 --> 13:22.473
because at the time, at 16, 17, 18,
it's the biggest medal you can win.

13:23.099 --> 13:26.643
<I>We had a great team spirit.
Great bunch of lads. Great coaches.</I>

13:26.644 --> 13:27.978
<I>We hadn't won it for a long time,</I>

13:27.979 --> 13:31.023
<I>and we lifted the cup at Old Trafford,
we couldn't ask for much more really.</I>

13:31.024 --> 13:34.568
It was an achievement, but it's never
enough to just win one trophy.

13:35.528 --> 13:39.198
<I>"Okay, next year we're
going to do it again."</I>

13:45.288 --> 13:47.456
BUTT: <I>Best time of my career
was my apprenticeship.</I>

13:47.457 --> 13:49.208
<I>You go to work every day
together with your mates,</I>

13:49.209 --> 13:51.126
<I>you've got no cares in the world,
it's just fun.</I>

13:51.127 --> 13:52.252
<I>You knew you was good,</I>

13:52.253 --> 13:54.338
<I>you knew you was better than most teams
you played against.</I>

13:54.339 --> 13:57.257
But they were the best times in my career,
I can still say that now.

13:57.258 --> 13:59.843
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

14:10.897 --> 14:14.358
What happened at The Cliff
when we was kids was the old apprentices,

14:14.359 --> 14:17.694
or the first-year pro,
would always, you know...

14:17.695 --> 14:18.737
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:19.239 --> 14:23.534
get hold of the first-year apprentices,
which was us, do all sorts.

14:23.535 --> 14:25.327
Most of the things are unspeakable.

14:25.328 --> 14:28.789
It was the end of that era
where it was just the done thing.

14:28.790 --> 14:32.126
Where part of your initiation,
part of your growing-up process,

14:32.127 --> 14:36.046
your toughening-up process, was to put
you in situations that you didn't like.

14:36.047 --> 14:40.175
They put me in a kit bag and
padlocked it up once and put me on a bus.

14:40.176 --> 14:42.511
And then did the same with Scholesy
the week later.

14:43.012 --> 14:46.390
Nicky wasn't small,
but I was tiny, so I'd fit in quite easily.

14:46.391 --> 14:48.934
And you'd end up smacking
the bag like this,

14:48.935 --> 14:52.396
and you'd be in the middle of Old Trafford
in the laundry getting plucked out.

14:52.397 --> 14:54.731
So it were unlocked and sent back.

14:54.732 --> 14:58.819
At dinner times, you just knew
when you've had your dinner, that's it,

14:58.820 --> 15:01.321
the second-years were gonna
absolutely try and abuse you.

15:01.322 --> 15:03.282
And we just all used
to go and hide somewhere.

15:03.283 --> 15:04.908
I think we used to hide in the big gym.

15:04.909 --> 15:11.081
When it comes to initiations, a lot of people,
it would be over in 20 seconds, 15 seconds.

15:12.083 --> 15:15.794
They would just do something stupid,
you'd get a round of, "That was brilliant",

15:15.795 --> 15:19.965
you get a round of applause,
right, you don't have to do anything again.

15:19.966 --> 15:22.718
There would be the odd player
who wouldn't do it,

15:22.719 --> 15:25.721
or didn't want to do it,
or would do it rubbish,

15:25.722 --> 15:28.140
and then you would be on 'em.

15:28.766 --> 15:31.935
There's one time they put Scholesy
in the dryer and...

15:31.936 --> 15:33.520
I don't know whether they turned it on,

15:33.521 --> 15:36.899
but they shut the door and they might've
just turned it on and off like that, quick.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.775
I think he had a panic attack.

15:38.776 --> 15:40.777
But it was a big old
industrial dryer, as well.

15:40.778 --> 15:42.237
I think that's what brought his asthma on.

15:44.199 --> 15:47.284
The nightclub scene was the best.
You had to chat someone up.

15:47.285 --> 15:48.827
I had to do that with you once.

15:48.828 --> 15:50.120
- Chat them up?
- Yeah.

15:50.121 --> 15:54.791
It wasn't my greatest skill
when I was a young kid, chatting girls up.

15:56.044 --> 15:59.838
I had to perform sexual actions
to Clayton Blackmore's calendar.

15:59.839 --> 16:01.423
No!

16:01.424 --> 16:03.717
- On the bed?
- Yeah, on the bed.

16:03.718 --> 16:05.761
Yeah, that was my worst one.

16:05.762 --> 16:07.888
Boot polish, as well, on the...

16:07.889 --> 16:10.349
I had a boot-polish number
put on the back of my...

16:10.350 --> 16:12.059
- The bongs on your back?
- What about the spoon in your mouth?

16:12.060 --> 16:13.268
What, did they draw the kit on you?

16:13.269 --> 16:14.978
I'm not sure about that.
I'm not sure who did it, but...

16:14.979 --> 16:16.146
Giggsy used to draw the kit on him.

16:16.147 --> 16:17.314
- Do you not think...
- it was you!

16:17.315 --> 16:19.733
- It was part of his initiation.
- Don't even know why you're here.

16:19.734 --> 16:22.319
Right, and look how you turned out.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.488
- No, I didn't enjoy it.
- You're welcome.

16:24.489 --> 16:25.656
(LAUGHING)

16:25.657 --> 16:28.659
- You was horrible, Giggsy.
- BUTT: I hated him.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.535
It made you solid, it made you hard,
it made you tough.

16:30.536 --> 16:34.790
It made you not be soared
of looking a fool in front of your friends.

16:34.791 --> 16:39.253
Not be scared of, you know, saying things
out loud in front of older players.

16:39.254 --> 16:42.881
So, although it probably,
nowadays, could be classed as bullying,

16:42.882 --> 16:46.551
it was a massive part
of becoming a player at the club.

16:46.552 --> 16:49.888
Because if you're a 20-year-old lad
and something's wrong on the pitch,

16:49.889 --> 16:52.516
if you've not got the bollocks
and go and say it to the older players,

16:52.517 --> 16:54.518
then you've got no chance of making it
at Man United.

16:54.519 --> 16:58.146
Even though I hated it,
and it used to make me ill,

16:58.147 --> 17:02.526
I still think there's part of that old-school
values and that toughening-up process

17:02.527 --> 17:05.194
that the kids nowadays miss out on.

17:05.195 --> 17:09.491
I'm happy that us lot came through
at that time,

17:09.492 --> 17:13.036
because when we came
into being reserve-team players,

17:13.037 --> 17:15.038
we were the players that stopped it.

17:15.039 --> 17:20.711
<I>We were the players that kind of knew it
wasn't right to do these kinds of things.</I>

17:21.546 --> 17:36.845
And it stopped.

17:36.846 --> 17:40.932
GARY: <I>Got to remember that
in the, sort of, '60s, '70s and '80s,</I>

17:40.933 --> 17:45.061
<I>that Liverpool had an incredible time,
you know, in music, football,</I>

17:45.062 --> 17:46.396
<I>and I suppose in some ways,</I>

17:46.397 --> 17:48.356
<I>this last 20 years
has been Manchester's time.</I>

17:48.357 --> 17:52.360
<I>The Stone Roses, Oasis.
United winning the league.</I>

17:52.361 --> 17:55.238
<I>But the two cities
have got a lot of similarities.</I>

17:55.239 --> 17:58.825
<I>The spirit and fight, the honesty,
the integrity of the people.</I>

17:58.826 --> 18:01.203
<I>There's tribalness to it.
Why shouldn't there be?</I>

18:22.767 --> 18:24.226
<I>GARY: When was your first goal here?</I>

18:24.227 --> 18:25.519
BECKHAM: Galatasaray.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.937
<I>GARY: Was it?
BECKHAM: Oh, yeah.</I>

18:26.938 --> 18:29.105
<I>- Was it that scuff into the corner?
- Yeah.</I>

18:29.106 --> 18:30.565
<I>Proper scuff.</I>

18:30.566 --> 18:32.692
- When was yours, Scholesy?
- Trying to think.

18:35.947 --> 18:39.214
Do you remember you used to play at all?
Have you just completely forgotten already?

18:39.215 --> 18:43.594
I remember, '99 season, January, Liverpool.

18:43.595 --> 18:45.095
- The FA Cup?
- In the FA Cup.

18:45.889 --> 18:47.598
- One-nil down, weren't we, with what...
- Yeah...

18:47.599 --> 18:49.725
- Five minutes to go.
- Michael scored for them, didn't he?

18:49.726 --> 18:51.894
- Michael Owen?
- Yeah.

18:51.895 --> 18:53.437
That's was my fault, as well.

18:53.438 --> 18:55.230
(LAUGHING)

18:55.231 --> 18:57.733
They just got a cross in,
I just couldn't get my head there in time.

18:57.734 --> 18:59.234
- You remember?
- You left your runner.

18:59.235 --> 19:01.570
I think you blamed me, as well.
Again.

19:01.571 --> 19:03.405
I always remember the
goals I give away, me.

19:04.866 --> 19:06.867
There's that many of them, though,
aren't there?

19:07.577 --> 19:09.912
I thought that was the best atmosphere
of the season.

19:09.913 --> 19:11.372
- To be fair.
- Yeah.

19:11.373 --> 19:15.376
Yeah. That last couple of minutes here.
That's where it all started, I think.

19:23.176 --> 19:25.260
BUTT: I think the beginning
of the season, '98/'99,

19:25.261 --> 19:27.513
I don't think it was any different
to any other season.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.807
We knew we had a good team,
a good squad.

19:29.808 --> 19:31.225
We expected to go and do well.

19:31.226 --> 19:33.769
Our form was inconsistent
in the early parts of the season.

19:33.770 --> 19:35.396
We were conceding goals.

19:35.397 --> 19:37.564
We were exciting,
the attacking football was brilliant,

19:37.565 --> 19:39.483
but we were still conceding goals
in the league.

19:40.777 --> 19:43.862
But at the turn at Christmas,
the FA Cup against Liverpool...

19:43.863 --> 19:44.988
(GARY EXHALES IN RELIEF)

19:44.989 --> 19:46.448
<I>What</I> a <I>game that</I> was.

19:47.784 --> 19:50.327
<I>And then it just seemed
to snowball from there.</I>

19:52.706 --> 19:53.872
<I>COMMENTATOR:
You know, the season hasn't been</I>

19:53.873 --> 19:55.666
<I>all Manchester United had hoped for.</I>

19:55.667 --> 19:57.167
<I>Not so far.</I>

19:57.168 --> 20:00.629
<I>But an FA Cup tie against
what is a young Liverpool team,</I>

20:00.630 --> 20:02.381
<I>at this stage, could change that.</I>

20:02.382 --> 20:04.091
One-nil down.

20:04.092 --> 20:10.815
Four minutes, five minutes to go.

20:10.816 --> 20:13.151
<I>COMMENTATOR:
Beckham may just take this on.</I>

20:14.153 --> 20:17.029
<I>Lifted towards the head of Cole...
And Yorke!</I>

20:17.030 --> 20:20.199
When you're one-nil down
and you score that equaliser,

20:20.200 --> 20:22.326
you know it's coming.

20:22.327 --> 20:25.455
<I>COMMENTATOR: Into Cole again...
May break for Scholes.</I>

20:25.456 --> 20:27.979
<I>Solskjaer!</I>

20:27.980 --> 20:30.982
You know, for us to come back
and score two late goals,

20:30.983 --> 20:33.818
sort of set the tone of the season,
and it was, for me,

20:33.819 --> 20:35.945
it was the turning point that...

20:35.946 --> 20:38.698
Teams knew that,
no matter what the score was,

20:38.699 --> 20:40.575
we would still come back at them.

20:40.576 --> 20:46.036
It's at the back of their mind that,
"They always come back, these."

20:46.037 --> 20:48.663
The story of Manchester United was great.

20:51.834 --> 20:57.381
Us great players...
Now we could feel...

20:59.050 --> 21:00.467
like the ghosts.

21:06.974 --> 21:11.395
I remember walking the corridors
up to the manager's office at Old Trafford.

21:11.396 --> 21:14.314
And the smell of Sir Matt Busby's pipe.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.983
You just knew there was a big...

21:16.984 --> 21:20.028
Just a big presence about him
still there and...

21:20.029 --> 21:23.657
You just walked past and, you know,
you might see him now and again.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.700
The door would always be open.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.412
I look back now and think, you know,
we should have gone in more

21:28.413 --> 21:30.163
and talked to him more,
but you were scared.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.998
This was like a god.

21:34.585 --> 21:37.212
DANNY <I>BOYLE: And there were two, like,
big important books in our family.</I>

21:37.213 --> 21:39.005
<I>One was a massive Bible.</I>

21:39.006 --> 21:40.882
And the other book was the photo album,

21:40.883 --> 21:43.510
you know, like black-and-white photos
of us as little kids.

21:44.137 --> 21:49.391
And with a, you know, big extended family
around the area and all that kind of stuff.

21:49.392 --> 21:53.645
Biggest picture in that book, at the back,
was the Busby Babes.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.565
<I>NEWS REPORTER:
On the fringe of</I> a <I>Munich Airport</I>

21:56.566 --> 21:58.275
<I>lies the wreckage of an airliner</I>

21:58.276 --> 22:02.195
<I>still smouldering from a crash,
in which 21 people were killed.</I>

22:03.239 --> 22:06.032
HARRISON: (SIGHS SADLY)
<I>I</I> heard <I>it</I> at <I>school.</I>

22:06.033 --> 22:09.661
I heard that news at school,
and I was crying my eyes out at school.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.122
You know, and I mean the teacher
took me to another room,

22:12.123 --> 22:14.416
I was that emotional about it, you know.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.960
<I>And I thought, they can't be dead.</I>

22:16.961 --> 22:20.797
<I>The teacher said to me,
"Sorry, Eric, I'm sorry, they are."</I>

22:23.176 --> 22:25.886
GARY: <I>I think probably 17, 18,
we'd won the Youth Cup,</I>

22:25.887 --> 22:28.680
<I>the Busby Babe comparison
started to come out.</I>

22:29.515 --> 22:31.433
<I>You've got big footsteps to follow here.</I>

22:31.434 --> 22:36.313
<I>You've got lads who were young men,
just wanting to play football,</I>

22:36.314 --> 22:38.273
<I>wanting to dream like we're dreaming.</I>

22:39.817 --> 22:42.319
<I>Their legacy is enormous.</I>

22:42.320 --> 22:46.198
Everything you see there at that club today
was built out of that tragedy

22:46.199 --> 22:48.909
and Sir Matt Busby's determination
to grow another team.

22:49.535 --> 22:53.953
To rebound. To go again.

22:53.954 --> 22:56.372
<I>BECKHAM: Obviously what he created
at Manchester United</I>

22:56.373 --> 23:00.877
<I>led to what the boss had created
at Manchester United and what,</I>

23:00.878 --> 23:03.755
<I>you know, we were part of.</I>

23:03.756 --> 23:22.784
<I>And you feel that.</I>

23:22.785 --> 23:24.953
I was born in Cardiff.
My dad played rugby,

23:24.954 --> 23:26.913
so he signed professionally
for Swinton,

23:26.914 --> 23:29.916
so I moved to Manchester when I was seven.

23:29.917 --> 23:32.836
Everyone on my street was United fans,

23:32.837 --> 23:35.630
and I used to go watch them, Stretford End,
United <I>Road.</I>

23:35.631 --> 23:39.134
<I>Go with my mates,
catch the match bus, the 26.</I>

23:39.135 --> 23:41.178
Try and climb over the fence
and get in for nothing.

23:41.179 --> 23:45.307
You know, all that sort of stuff,
as a United fan, I used to do.

23:45.308 --> 23:47.976
GARY: <I>First time I seen him play,
I was like, "Oh, my God,</I>

23:47.977 --> 23:49.811
"What have I just seen?"

23:49.812 --> 23:52.731
If that's the standard
that we have to get to, I'm done.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.733
I'm finished. What's the point?

23:54.734 --> 23:57.778
You know what I mean? Go back to Bury.

23:57.779 --> 24:00.072
Kick your little ball against a wall.

24:00.073 --> 24:03.283
Just get off this pitch away from him,
because honestly he was unbelievable.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.369
COMMENTATOR: Ryan <I>Wilson</I> again.

24:06.370 --> 24:08.914
<I>He is Salford's star man.</I>

24:08.915 --> 24:12.292
<I>That's a terrific pass for Winwood.
Oh, that's a marvellous goal.</I>

24:12.293 --> 24:13.835
We were nowhere near him,
do you know what I mean?

24:13.836 --> 24:55.301
We weren't even in the same bracket as him.

24:55.302 --> 24:58.847
Yes, when I arrived, Giggs was playing.
Yeah.

25:00.224 --> 25:04.978
Yeah, and now I retired, what,
15 years ago and he still plays.

25:07.148 --> 25:08.940
It's crazy.

25:08.941 --> 25:12.694
I'll never forget the manager, sort of,
naming the team

25:12.695 --> 25:15.238
in the old dressing rooms at Old Trafford.

25:15.239 --> 25:18.533
And I'm just sat there
and I'm not not listening to him,

25:18.534 --> 25:22.579
but sort of half not interested,
because I didn't think I was playing.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.622
So left wing is last.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.374
And he...
And I'll never forget it.

25:26.375 --> 25:29.127
It was like, "And Ryan,
you'll play on the left today."

25:29.962 --> 25:35.175
I was like, "Did you say my name there?"
And like...

25:35.176 --> 25:38.052
started... I don't like flying.

25:38.053 --> 25:39.470
So when we're taking off,

25:39.471 --> 25:41.723
I've got, like, sweaty palms
like you wouldn't believe.

25:41.724 --> 25:44.434
And it was like...
It was exactly the same feeling.

25:44.435 --> 25:47.896
<I>COMMENTATOR:
Number 14 is 17-year-old Ryan Giggs.</I>

25:48.772 --> 25:51.608
We looked at him and thought,
"That's our motivation."

25:51.609 --> 25:54.611
"You know, if the manager's
giving him a chance,

25:54.612 --> 25:56.863
"then surely he's going to give us
a chance at some point."

25:57.573 --> 25:59.282
<I>COMMENTATOR: And this is Giggs!</I>

25:59.283 --> 26:01.618
<I>Oh, he's just getting better and better!</I>

26:03.662 --> 26:06.956
GIGGS: The manager used to always say,
if I'd ever I had a shave,

26:06.957 --> 26:09.959
then the next day in training
he'd just look at me,

26:09.960 --> 26:13.630
"You was out last night, weren't you?"
And I'd go, "No."

26:13.631 --> 26:16.257
He'd go, "Yes, you was.
You always have a shave.

26:16.258 --> 26:17.550
"When you've gone out,
you always have a shave,

26:17.551 --> 26:19.427
"you're always clean-shaven."

26:19.428 --> 26:22.597
So from then on, I just learned,
if I went out, I just wouldn't shave.

26:22.598 --> 26:23.640
(LAUGHS)

26:26.644 --> 26:28.269
I think growing up in Manchester,
in the '90s,

26:28.270 --> 26:31.105
obviously it was brilliant,
it was massive.

26:31.106 --> 26:35.026
GIGGS: <I>It was the time of The Stone Roses,
Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets,</I>

26:35.027 --> 26:36.694
<I>all the house music,</I>

26:36.695 --> 26:38.655
<I>and it was the place to be.</I>

26:38.656 --> 26:41.366
- I mean, it was a ridiculous place.
- BUTT: The Hacienda. The Boardwalk.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.368
We were going to concerts, Spike Island,

26:43.369 --> 26:45.078
<I>and it was a real special time really.</I>

26:45.079 --> 26:48.289
<I>I remember once the whole
Man United team went to the Hacienda.</I>

26:48.290 --> 26:51.376
Wouldn't happen nowadays
with the press everywhere, but...

26:51.377 --> 26:55.505
You'd have what's called a player's pass,
a Man United player's pass.

26:55.506 --> 26:57.632
So every, like...

26:57.633 --> 26:59.342
professional had one.

26:59.343 --> 27:01.427
And certain clubs, you'd
get in free with it.

27:02.263 --> 27:06.766
So you'd go out with your player's pass,
show it the bouncer, you know, "Let me in."

27:06.767 --> 27:09.519
BUTT: That was a good thing that I liked
about my upbringing in Manchester,

27:09.520 --> 27:13.690
was everyone looked after each other.
If you was a good-enough guy,

27:13.691 --> 27:15.858
you didn't show off too much
and you weren't big-headed,

27:15.859 --> 27:16.985
the bouncer looked after you.

27:16.986 --> 27:20.822
It just seemed like the magic dust literally
had been sprayed all over the city.

27:20.823 --> 27:23.491
<I>So it was good to see the football
and the music thing.</I>

27:23.492 --> 27:26.953
You know, what else is there?
What else is there?

27:27.871 --> 27:29.539
<I>BOYLE: Manchester reinvented itself.</I>

27:29.540 --> 27:35.378
It didn't wait for a leader to do that
for it. In fact, it took the disinterest

27:35.379 --> 27:40.883
that was clearly shown to it
by Margaret Thatcher's premiership,

27:40.884 --> 27:45.054
and it took that as actually
a signal to do it itself.

27:45.055 --> 27:48.683
WOMAN: We can't even get out,
we're walking on cockroaches, beetles.

27:48.684 --> 27:51.227
In flats in this block?

27:51.228 --> 27:52.895
In these flats over here.

27:52.896 --> 27:57.066
We've got people coming up using the place as
brothels and everything all over the place.

27:57.067 --> 27:58.401
It's disgusting.

27:58.944 --> 28:02.196
We all grew up as
Thatcher's children and...

28:02.197 --> 28:06.075
You know, hand on my heart,
that bitch gave me my start in music, man,

28:06.076 --> 28:08.369
because she put me on the dole
straight out of school.

28:08.370 --> 28:10.913
<I>And where else would I have got the chance
to learn an instrument?</I>

28:10.914 --> 28:14.584
BOYLE: There are some great northern cities
that actually aren't beholden to anyone,

28:14.585 --> 28:18.004
you know, and no matter how bad it gets,
they will regenerate themselves.

28:18.005 --> 28:22.675
Now, the football teams, of course,
especially United, is a symbol of that.

28:23.761 --> 28:29.015
GIGGS: <I>Sharpey loved to go out,
loved to party and have</I> a <I>good time.</I>

28:29.016 --> 28:32.935
For me, he was the one who I had, probably,
the most in common with because of the age.

28:32.936 --> 28:37.273
I've seen Giggsy and Lee Sharpe
and a few of the guys out and about in town

28:37.274 --> 28:40.610
and in the clubs at the time
and what have you.

28:40.611 --> 28:44.072
I suppose we should have took it
on ourselves to tell them to naff off home

28:44.073 --> 28:48.034
and get an early night, before there's
a Liverpool game coming up or summat.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.913
But it's not our place to do that, is it?

28:51.914 --> 28:54.791
Fergie had his little network
of guys out there doing just that,

28:54.792 --> 28:56.709
didn't he, I suppose, so...

28:57.419 --> 29:02.924
The gaffer had been tipped off
that me and Sharpey were going out.

29:03.425 --> 29:27.544
So he's just totally surprised us,
and we're at Sharpey's house...

29:27.545 --> 29:30.672
He threw my mate out.
He threw the girls out.

29:30.673 --> 29:33.967
He's going, "Where's that...
Where's Sharpey?"

29:33.968 --> 29:36.636
So one of my other mates has ran upstairs,

29:36.637 --> 29:39.180
said, "Sharpey!"
Sharpey's in the mirror, just...

29:39.181 --> 29:40.598
He's getting dressed.

29:40.599 --> 29:43.017
He's in his bedroom just, you know,
putting his jacket on.

29:44.103 --> 29:45.895
"Your gaffer's here, your gaffer's here."

29:45.896 --> 29:48.982
Sharpey's gone, "Yeah, all right, yeah.
Of course he is, yeah."

29:48.983 --> 29:51.860
Carried on sort of like getting ready.

29:51.861 --> 29:54.612
And in the mirror, he seen the gaffer
walking up the stairs.

29:55.698 --> 29:58.324
At this time, the apprentices
can hear his voice,

29:58.325 --> 30:00.160
because there was a few
of the apprentices out.

30:00.161 --> 30:03.663
They've hid in the wardrobe,
they've hid under the bed,

30:03.664 --> 30:05.373
one of them jumped out the window.

30:06.584 --> 30:09.377
And he didn't know about them.
They didn't get caught.

30:09.378 --> 30:12.213
So anyway, he's caught me
and Sharpey red-handed.

30:12.214 --> 30:15.476
And he's just sat us down
and he's absolutely battered us.

30:15.477 --> 30:18.020
<I>"Sharpey, you're going back in digs,
you're not having your own house.</I>

30:18.021 --> 30:19.438
"You've had too many chances."

30:19.439 --> 30:23.609
And he said to me, he's gone,
"Do you want to end up like him?"

30:23.610 --> 30:27.738
<I>From that day on, really,
I was a little bit more focused,</I>

30:27.739 --> 30:35.988
<I>and obviously I'd seen the gaffer
snap before, but not like that.</I>

30:35.989 --> 30:39.033
<I>COMMENTATOR: The last thing that
either club needed was a replay,</I>

30:39.034 --> 30:40.826
<I>but here we are.</I>

30:40.827 --> 30:45.247
<I>United already committed to two games
a week between now and the end of May,</I>

30:45.248 --> 30:47.875
<I>or they are if they're to keep thinking
about a treble.</I>

30:48.543 --> 30:51.462
<I>And let's not forget
the double's still on for Arsenal.</I>

30:51.463 --> 30:53.672
<I>Something's got to give here.</I>

30:58.804 --> 31:00.930
GIGGS: <I>We'd played, I think,
about three or four days before.</I>

31:00.931 --> 31:03.849
We had Juventus coming up,
we were doing well in the league.

31:03.850 --> 31:07.645
So the manager decided to change things.
I'd played in the first game.

31:07.646 --> 31:09.897
<I>We'd had a goal disallowed,
and we felt that we should have won it.</I>

31:10.524 --> 31:14.026
<I>And I just wanted to play in that game.
And I was subbed.</I>

31:15.529 --> 31:20.241
At that point in our careers,
Arsenal was the rivals.

31:20.242 --> 31:23.577
It was such a great Arsenal team,
it was the best team

31:23.578 --> 31:25.704
that, probably,
we played against domestically.

31:25.705 --> 31:29.750
<I>Power, pace, aggression, experience, skill.</I>

31:29.751 --> 31:32.336
They had everything. And...

31:33.755 --> 31:35.589
They were such a tough
team to play against.

31:35.590 --> 31:38.884
I mean, Martin Keown from England,
and they were all...

31:38.885 --> 31:41.053
And David Seaman, they were all great lads,
I really like them.

31:41.054 --> 31:43.055
But on the pitch, there
was just a real hatred.

31:43.056 --> 31:45.641
And it had been such a tiring game.

31:45.642 --> 31:50.020
<I>You know, going 1-nil up,
then 1-1, and then...</I>

31:50.021 --> 31:53.357
<I>Keaney got sent off, so we're playing,
obviously, a man down.</I>

31:53.358 --> 31:54.984
There were so many emotions as well.

31:56.611 --> 31:58.320
I probably should have came off.

31:58.321 --> 32:01.157
I was physically and mentally exhausted.

32:01.158 --> 32:05.327
It was such an emotionally charged evening
that I just hit a brick wall.

32:05.328 --> 32:08.247
The ball came across to Ray Parlour
and he was taking me on.

32:08.248 --> 32:11.458
And I remember feeling shattered.

32:11.459 --> 32:15.838
I actually remember him running at me,
to this day, thinking, "I'm dead here."

32:16.381 --> 32:19.967
So I just collapsed on the floor,
thinking I've got to make a tackle.

32:19.968 --> 32:23.304
And it was a tired...
I made the wrong decision.

32:24.556 --> 32:30.895
And when I give the penalty away,
I remember thinking, "Life's over.

32:30.896 --> 32:32.104
I'm dead-

32:32.105 --> 32:34.023
<I>"I'd rather die than this penalty go in."</I>

32:34.024 --> 32:38.110
And it was one of those moments
when I honestly thought,

32:38.111 --> 32:39.945
if Dennis Bergkamp would have scored,

32:39.946 --> 32:42.781
my Man United career
would have probably been finished.

32:42.782 --> 32:44.658
(FANS CHEERING)

32:51.541 --> 32:53.500
(CHEERING WILDLY)

32:55.754 --> 32:58.631
Me and Phil go to celebrate
with Peter Schmeichel,

32:58.632 --> 33:01.967
he literally shoves us
the other side of the box.

33:01.968 --> 33:05.054
He literally clothes-lined me away.
And I was back on it.

33:05.055 --> 33:06.639
The game was getting a bit stretched.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.642
So I think the manager thought
it would be perfect for me to come on now,

33:09.643 --> 33:14.772
fresh legs, and the managerjust says,
"I think the right back's tiring.

33:16.316 --> 33:20.444
"Whenever you get a chance, run at him.
Make something happen."

33:20.445 --> 33:23.197
You're 10 men, you're thinking
it's going to penalties.

33:23.198 --> 33:24.657
You're hanging on.

33:25.325 --> 33:28.410
Arsenal have sort of
wave after wave of attack.

33:28.411 --> 33:30.246
And then Giggsy picks the ball up.

33:30.247 --> 33:32.957
<I>PHIL: Patrick Vieira plays the ball square.</I>

33:32.958 --> 33:35.292
<I>And I just remember Giggsy setting off.</I>

33:35.293 --> 33:39.338
When I sprint, you can tell I'm sprinting.
Everything is moving.

33:39.339 --> 33:42.466
With Giggsy it's almost slow motion,

33:42.467 --> 33:47.012
he glides on the top of the surface,
his feet don't touch the ground.

33:47.013 --> 33:50.099
He picked the ball up.
And I was at left back behind him,

33:50.100 --> 33:53.978
and I was shouting,
"Giggsy, Giggsy, I'm on my way."

33:53.979 --> 33:55.854
Thinking I was going to overlap him.

33:58.733 --> 34:02.319
And Giggsy just went further
and further and further away from me.

34:03.029 --> 34:06.615
He starts running at players,
and I've seen Giggsy do this

34:06.616 --> 34:10.286
since I was 15 years old.

34:10.286 --> 34:13.330
I stood still and it was like slow motion.

34:13.331 --> 34:16.125
In and out, gliding in and out.
He was like a gazelle.

34:16.126 --> 34:18.710
<I>He had this grace about him.</I>

34:18.712 --> 34:22.755
<I>And he was making body movements
without even touching the ball.</I>

34:22.757 --> 34:26.051
<I>And Lee Dixon went for one,
Martin Keown went for one.</I>

34:27.178 --> 34:30.597
<I>BECKHAM: I just saw him going through,
going through, keeping on going.</I>

34:30.598 --> 34:32.683
I'm thinking Scholes is
coming in back post.

34:32.684 --> 34:34.351
Look at Scholesy, look at Scholesy.

34:34.893 --> 34:37.730
And all he had to do
was square it to me

34:37.731 --> 34:39.940
and I'd make a big run

34:39.940 --> 34:42.275
and I tell you, I think
I was still 20 yards behind him,

34:42.277 --> 34:43.944
and I was sprinting as fast as I could.

34:43.945 --> 34:47.989
That was Ryan Giggs, whether
he was playing on Lower Broughton Road,

34:47.991 --> 34:51.452
Littleton Road,
The Cliff training ground, Carrington...

34:51.453 --> 34:54.413
<I>That was what Ryan Giggs was all about.</I>

34:54.414 --> 34:56.331
This was Giggsy's moment.

35:05.759 --> 35:07.426
COMMENTATOR: <I>What</I> a <I>goal!</I>

35:08.386 --> 35:12.264
<I>You have seen a magician wave a wand!</I>

35:14.225 --> 35:16.643
<I>And conjure up a trick</I>

35:16.644 --> 35:22.775
<I>which the FA Cup
and all its glorious past can revel in.</I>

35:22.776 --> 35:25.611
You just lose yourself
and don't know what you're doing.

35:25.612 --> 35:27.404
And everything...

35:28.656 --> 35:30.824
Sanity just goes out of your head.

35:30.825 --> 35:34.453
And I just decided
to take my shirt off and just...

35:35.246 --> 35:36.455
start swinging it.

35:37.874 --> 35:40.459
<I>The team were coming over.
Fans were coming over.</I>

35:40.460 --> 35:42.336
They were on top of me and it's just...

35:42.337 --> 35:43.962
unbelievable.

35:44.756 --> 35:48.592
How many times are you going to see
a goal like that in your lifetime?

35:48.593 --> 35:51.136
Especially scored
by one of your lads as well.

35:51.137 --> 35:52.805
<I>SCHOLES: It is the best
goal I've ever seen.</I>

35:52.806 --> 35:56.141
Just for everything,
how important it was,

35:56.142 --> 35:57.851
and the way he did it,
who he went past.

35:57.852 --> 36:01.522
As a defender,
you look at those lads differently,

36:01.523 --> 36:04.650
and they're the heroes for you,
they produce the biggest moments,

36:04.651 --> 36:07.361
at the best times, when you need them.

36:07.362 --> 36:09.780
And throughout that season
they all delivered.

36:09.781 --> 36:10.864
Every single one of them.

36:10.865 --> 36:14.079
But Giggsy's moment
is the stand-out moment.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.330
I mean, I think if they'd have won,

36:15.331 --> 36:17.666
they might have gone on
and won the double, but...

36:17.667 --> 36:18.959
Have you ever seen the footage when,

36:18.960 --> 36:21.211
you know, when he scores the goal
and goes like this...

36:21.212 --> 36:23.672
- Watch the footage of Scholesy...
- I got into the goal.

36:23.673 --> 36:27.550
He goes in the goal and goes like this...
He's probably thinking, what am I doing?

36:27.551 --> 36:28.802
- I've never seen it.
- Have you seen it?

36:28.803 --> 36:30.845
Because I was running
waiting for you to square it.

36:30.846 --> 36:33.223
And you ran away celebrating,
and you take your top off,

36:33.224 --> 36:34.557
and I go like that...

36:34.558 --> 36:36.184
(LAUGHS)

36:38.187 --> 36:40.397
That'd had have got me out jail,
Scholesy, that one.

36:40.398 --> 37:48.661
- Right next to me.
- Yeah, it would have done, yeah.

37:48.662 --> 37:50.789
<I>I used to play
two or three years above myself.</I>

37:50.790 --> 37:54.542
I wasn't-just in my own age group playing
at centre back or fullback or in midfield,

37:54.543 --> 37:57.378
so I was playing with men
when I was only a boy.

37:57.379 --> 38:00.423
<I>So I realised early on
that to get forward in the game,</I>

38:00.424 --> 38:02.842
<I>I needed many strings to my bow.</I>

38:03.886 --> 38:07.097
The England manager used to say to me,
you need to nail down one position.

38:07.098 --> 38:08.306
You need to nail down one position,

38:08.307 --> 38:11.267
if you do that, you'll have
a bigger, better, longer career.

38:11.268 --> 38:13.061
And I used to come away thinking,

38:13.062 --> 38:16.314
that is the biggest load of rubbish
that I've ever heard in my life.

38:16.315 --> 38:18.399
I'm 19, I'm 20,

38:18.400 --> 38:21.694
<I>I'm a regular in Man United's
first-team squad.</I>

38:21.695 --> 38:23.571
And I think it was
probably one of the times

38:23.572 --> 38:25.907
when I probably did have to be
strong with myself,

38:25.908 --> 38:28.552
that what I was doing
and what I believed in was right.

38:28.553 --> 38:31.430
<I>Phil was always popular, because he was...</I>

38:31.431 --> 38:33.474
<I>He was comfortable
around anyone's company.</I>

38:33.475 --> 38:36.894
He was one of them people
who were good in the dressing room,

38:36.895 --> 38:40.856
and good to have around, because
he would just make people feel at ease.

38:44.319 --> 38:48.864
<I>As a fullback, you need to develop a trick,
and mine was a step-over.</I>

38:51.242 --> 38:53.202
<I>And I worked on it every day.</I>

38:53.203 --> 38:56.080
<I>And I did it in a game
once at Old Trafford.</I>

38:56.081 --> 39:00.668
I did a step-over, got to the by-line,
crossed it, and... we nearly scored.

39:00.669 --> 39:05.172
And as I was running back,
Butty, Becks, Keano,

39:05.715 --> 39:08.592
they were laughing their heads off.
Just laughing their heads off,

39:08.593 --> 39:12.388
and I could not understand for the
life of me why they were laughing.

39:12.389 --> 39:16.266
I'd just done the best step-over
that this club has ever seen,

39:16.267 --> 39:19.937
and they're absolutely
wetting themselves laughing.

39:19.938 --> 39:24.358
So the next time I get the ball,
I threw in a double step-over,

39:24.359 --> 39:26.902
and the crowd, you know,
they were cheering,

39:26.903 --> 39:28.529
and I think they thought
I was taking the mickey.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.614
But this is something
that I was serious about

39:30.615 --> 39:33.075
and I've worked on for six months.

39:33.076 --> 39:35.577
And I'd just produced it at Old Trafford
against Southampton.

39:35.578 --> 39:38.080
So I turned round after
the double step-over,

39:38.081 --> 39:42.126
and Roy Keane looked at me
and just said, "Stop f'ing about."

39:42.127 --> 39:44.294
I wasn't too happy when...

39:45.380 --> 39:47.756
I'm playing in a game, and I'm thinking,

39:47.757 --> 39:51.719
"They're singing my song, you know,
for the first few seconds, and then..."

39:51.720 --> 39:53.804
# <I>Phil, Phil Will tear you a...</I> #

39:53.805 --> 39:54.972
Whoa! Whoa!

39:54.973 --> 39:56.765
"That's not right. Phil?

39:56.766 --> 39:58.308
"No, it's my song."

39:58.309 --> 40:03.313
it must have not been that good, because
everyone used to slaughter me about it.

40:06.317 --> 40:08.569
For Ferguson, it was important.

40:08.570 --> 40:11.947
The academy,
young players was very important.

40:13.074 --> 40:16.285
Then we could see
that it was a great generation,

40:16.286 --> 40:19.246
and we could hear
the coaches and everybody.

40:20.415 --> 40:21.707
It was a great generation.

40:21.708 --> 40:24.001
And then you have to have the...

40:24.961 --> 40:28.414
It's simple, then to have the manager
who gives them the chance to play.

40:28.415 --> 40:31.292
I remember I was on holiday,
I think I was in Cyprus,

40:31.293 --> 40:33.502
and I pick up the paper
and you see all these players are going,

40:33.503 --> 40:35.838
and you're thinking,
"Wow, what's going on here?"

40:35.839 --> 40:39.342
<I>They must be going to go and buy
some proper big players to replace them.</I>

40:39.343 --> 40:42.678
Obviously the manager
was looking at where we could improve,

40:42.679 --> 40:46.474
but I don't think anyone could foresee
what he was going to do.

40:46.475 --> 40:49.310
<I>You know Mark Hughes,
Andrei Kanchelskis and Paul Ince.</I>

40:49.311 --> 40:52.188
<I>You know, three massive players for United.</I>

40:52.189 --> 40:55.024
To be fair to the gaffer,
he stood by us, didn't he?

40:55.025 --> 40:58.402
He could have bought any player he wanted.

40:58.403 --> 41:01.197
He was under pressure around that time,
the gaffer, wasn't he?

41:01.782 --> 41:03.741
The three players that went...

41:03.742 --> 41:04.992
- Massive.
- Massive.

41:04.993 --> 41:06.744
- Fan player. You know.
- The fans loved them.

41:06.745 --> 41:09.997
- Fans loved them.
- Scholes, I suppose, came in for Sparky.

41:09.998 --> 41:12.124
You came in for Incey, you for Andrei.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.876
Me for Paul Parker. Because we were, like,

41:13.877 --> 41:18.693
we were all replacing brilliant players,
weren't we, do you know what I mean?

41:18.694 --> 41:20.486
It's a great risk.

41:23.866 --> 41:25.575
But...

41:25.576 --> 41:27.160
he knew it.

41:27.161 --> 41:28.620
And he was right.

41:28.621 --> 41:30.705
<I>And for me, of course, it was great to play</I>

41:30.706 --> 41:33.541
<I>with a generation of players,
win things with them.</I>

41:34.293 --> 41:37.086
Be a bit in the middle of that, you know?

41:37.087 --> 41:40.673
And help the new players,
and young players.

41:41.467 --> 41:43.593
And then we'd go back to training
and he'd still not bought any,

41:43.594 --> 41:45.178
he's still not bought any.
And before you know it,

41:45.179 --> 41:48.389
we were playing Aston Villa the first clay
of the year, and we was all in the team.

41:48.390 --> 41:52.060
After the first half an hour or something,
we were 3-nil down.

41:52.061 --> 41:53.394
It was a disaster, really...

41:53.395 --> 41:54.562
<I>COMMENTATOR: And Taylor's made it three!</I>

41:54.563 --> 41:55.772
<I>SCHOLES: at Aston Villa.</I>

41:55.773 --> 41:57.523
<I>COMMENT AT OR:
It's going from bad to worse.</I>

41:57.524 --> 41:58.775
BUTT: After the game we were thinking,

41:58.776 --> 42:01.027
"We've let the manager down,
he's put his faith in us,

42:01.028 --> 42:02.612
"we're only young,
the fans are going to hate us,

42:02.613 --> 42:05.323
"everyone's going to hate us
because we're wrecking the club."

42:05.324 --> 42:08.409
I think they've got problems.
I wouldn't say they've got major problems.

42:08.410 --> 42:13.331
Obviously, three players have departed.
The trick is always buy when you're strong.

42:13.332 --> 42:16.376
So he needs to buy players.
You can't win anything with kids.

42:16.377 --> 42:18.378
You look at that line-up
Manchester United had today,

42:18.379 --> 42:20.880
and Aston Villa, at quarter past two
when they get the team sheet,

42:20.881 --> 42:21.965
it's just going to give them a lift,

42:21.966 --> 42:24.926
and it'll happen every time he plays
the kids. He's got to buy players.

42:24.927 --> 42:27.553
In truth, that night,
watching <I>Match</I> Of The Day,

42:27.554 --> 42:32.016
I felt exactly the same as what
Alan Hansen said, we wasn't good enough.

42:32.559 --> 42:36.104
We wanted to believe in it.
And we tried everything to win it.

42:37.356 --> 42:39.065
But to be realistic...

42:40.818 --> 42:43.528
With five new players

42:45.906 --> 42:47.740
coming from the academy,

42:49.368 --> 42:50.743
19 years old,

42:51.286 --> 42:54.914
it's not very realistic
to think that you can win things.

42:55.749 --> 43:00.920
I wasn't probably at that stage of my
career where I felt comfortable to sort of,

43:01.755 --> 43:04.257
you know, "Don't worry about it,
it'll be all right."

43:04.258 --> 43:05.425
You know, I wasn't at that...

43:05.426 --> 43:08.261
'Cause I didn't know whether it was
going to be all right or not, you know?

43:08.262 --> 43:12.056
They have got star names to come in.
They've got Cole and Giggs.

43:12.057 --> 43:13.433
- Cantona, in due course.
- Cantona.

43:13.434 --> 43:14.684
- And Steve Bruce.
- Bruce.

43:14.685 --> 43:17.020
Still not enough.
The trick of winning the championship

43:17.021 --> 43:19.188
is having strength in depth.
They just haven't got it.

43:20.441 --> 43:24.986
But we tried so hard
and they were so exceptional,

43:25.738 --> 43:29.657
and Ferguson helped them
to learn things so quickly...

43:31.035 --> 43:32.660
that we won it.

43:35.456 --> 43:36.998
And we won the double.

43:37.583 --> 43:38.916
<I>Premier League and the Cup.</I>

43:38.917 --> 43:40.501
Eric, when he come back
from his suspension,

43:40.502 --> 43:46.382
he was phenomenal really and really
did carry the team quite a lot of the time.

43:46.383 --> 43:48.426
You don't win anything
with kids, he's right.

43:48.427 --> 43:49.510
You don't win anything with kids.

43:49.511 --> 43:54.307
We won because we were part of a team
that had Roy Keane in it,

43:54.850 --> 43:56.642
and we had Bruce, Palliate,

43:56.643 --> 43:59.687
we had all these top experienced players

44:00.564 --> 44:02.815
who got the young lads through it, really.

44:31.303 --> 44:34.722
We didn't realise how special it was,
to be honest, I think, at the time.

44:34.723 --> 44:38.309
Because, you know, we're all in the team.

44:38.310 --> 44:42.563
There was not one piece of jealousy
between any of us

44:42.564 --> 44:46.767
and all we were worried about
was staying in the team and doing well.

44:46.768 --> 44:48.811
I didn't play in the '96 final.

44:48.812 --> 44:50.145
In the final, we played Arsenal.

44:50.146 --> 44:51.689
He came round to my room in the morning,

44:51.690 --> 44:53.816
I could hear him coughing outside,
you know, that...

44:53.817 --> 44:55.526
Came in and said he wasn't playing,
you know,

44:55.527 --> 44:58.320
but you hear his cough outside the door
down the corridor.

44:58.321 --> 45:01.240
If you knew you were getting dropped,
I just didn't answer the door.

45:01.241 --> 45:04.410
If he can't find you, he can't drop you.
Can he?

45:04.411 --> 45:05.577
- Go missing.
- Yeah.

45:05.578 --> 45:07.371
SCHOLES: You did used to wait
for that knock though, didn't you?

45:07.372 --> 45:08.998
- Yeah, used to wait for the knock.
- About 11-ish.

45:09.916 --> 45:11.917
GARY: I remember once
him coming up to me,

45:12.961 --> 45:16.714
I think it was Thursday,
before a game on a Saturday.

45:16.715 --> 45:19.091
And he said, "I'm not playing you
on Saturday, son."

45:19.092 --> 45:24.263
He said, "I've got a game for you,
two weeks on Saturday,

45:24.264 --> 45:26.724
"it's just the game for you." I was like,

45:28.727 --> 45:32.396
"So I'm not playing for four games?"
"You make sure you prepare for that one.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.148
"I need you in that game."

45:35.191 --> 45:38.402
And I was like,
"Right, he needs me in that game."

45:38.403 --> 45:41.405
I'm thinking, "Have I been dropped
for four games,

45:41.406 --> 45:43.574
"or have I been told that I'm brilliant
and I'm needed for that?"

45:43.575 --> 45:45.305
I couldn't work it out.

45:45.306 --> 45:48.141
What's the best excuse he gave you
for leaving you out?

45:48.142 --> 45:49.642
- Too hot.
- Too hot?

45:49.643 --> 45:51.394
- "Really, Scholesy, it's too hot."
- "Too hot for you."

45:51.395 --> 45:53.146
"Sharpey always does well at Villa Park.

45:53.147 --> 45:55.231
"He always does well,
so I'm not going to play you."

45:55.232 --> 45:57.984
He said he was leaving me out
of Chelsea once because

45:57.985 --> 46:03.323
they had some Combat 18
fanatics in the crowd,

46:03.324 --> 46:06.076
and he thought I was a
bit too young for it.

46:06.077 --> 46:07.202
Best one he gave me was,

46:07.203 --> 46:10.121
"it's a nice ground, and
you come into your own on a heavy pitch,

46:10.122 --> 46:12.832
"so in November you'll be my player."

46:12.833 --> 46:16.795
So I only played one month a year, me,
one month a season.

46:18.047 --> 46:23.051
Thing about Nicky is, regardless
of his age, he always had that...

46:24.178 --> 46:30.183
schoolboy, 9, 10, 11-year-old look
on his face, of up to no good.

46:30.184 --> 46:33.269
Sir Alex used to say,
"Butt, you're up to no good."

46:33.270 --> 46:34.395
All the time.

46:35.731 --> 46:36.981
Silly little childish things.

46:36.982 --> 46:40.360
I did one once
with a teapot and Peter Schmeichel.

46:40.361 --> 46:43.196
You know, big 6'8" man, giant.

46:43.197 --> 46:46.366
SCHOLES: You'd come in the dressing room
and there was a tray of sandwiches

46:46.367 --> 46:51.412
and, you know, the big hot silver pots
with tea in or coffee.

46:52.164 --> 46:56.334
Obviously we were just sat
in the dressing room, a freezing cold day.

46:56.877 --> 47:00.713
Peter Schmeichel, obviously, he walks up
to get a sandwich and a cup of tea,

47:00.714 --> 47:02.924
absolutely bollocks.

47:03.467 --> 47:09.139
I put a steaming-hot kettle on the bed,
and I put it behind his arse, like that,

47:09.140 --> 47:11.057
so I was sort of like that,
looking at the lads, laughing,

47:11.058 --> 47:13.977
thinking he's just going to touch it there.

47:13.978 --> 47:17.063
And I've looked round like that,
he's turned round, full pirouette

47:17.064 --> 47:19.357
and caught his manhood right on the pot.

47:19.358 --> 47:21.901
And you heard a little... (MIMICS SIZZLE)
like that as well.

47:21.902 --> 47:25.947
And we're just looking in absolute
disbelief, and can't believe what he's done.

47:25.948 --> 47:28.491
And all I hear is... (GROANS)

47:29.451 --> 47:30.535
(IN AN ACCENT) "What are you doing?"

47:31.328 --> 47:33.746
<I>BUTT: Screamed as loud as he could.</I>

47:33.747 --> 47:36.207
<I>He's just going to kill me.
So I literally dropped the kettle</I>

47:36.208 --> 47:39.752
and I was just legging it right round,
all round The Cliff, and he's chasing me.

47:39.753 --> 47:41.754
Ended up having a big
blister on the end of it.

47:41.755 --> 47:46.384
I don't what he was thinking.
It was just a naughty school kid in him.

47:46.385 --> 47:47.927
"Right, I've got a pot here, he's...

47:47.928 --> 47:50.305
"Right, I think I'll have to do that,
there's nothing else I can...

47:50.306 --> 47:51.598
"Right, I'll do it."

47:51.599 --> 47:53.183
And I don't...

47:53.184 --> 47:55.685
I think he just lost himself.

47:55.686 --> 47:57.937
It is one of the funniest
things I've ever seen.

47:57.938 --> 47:59.105
Brilliant.

47:59.106 --> 48:00.565
<I>GARY: Manchester was absolutely brilliant.</I>

48:00.566 --> 48:03.985
<I>We were young lads playing for United.
What couldn't we be happy about?</I>

48:03.986 --> 48:05.445
We were doing
everything that you wanted to do,

48:05.446 --> 48:08.406
with the badge that you wanted to wear,
winning.

48:08.407 --> 48:10.950
GIGGS: <I>At the time
there was</I> a <I>lot of optimism.</I>

48:10.951 --> 48:13.161
You know, six lads from the youth team
have gone through

48:13.162 --> 48:15.121
and are regulars now in the United team.

48:15.122 --> 48:17.790
It was becoming a young person's world,
you know?

48:17.791 --> 48:21.002
Music was changing. Politics was changing.
Football was changing.

48:21.003 --> 48:26.257
You had a young band from Burnage,
Oasis, just ruling the world.

48:26.258 --> 48:29.886
And it gave a lot of optimism.
You could feel it within the country.

48:29.887 --> 48:32.597
<I>PHIL: Life in England
was just going along nicely.</I>

48:32.598 --> 48:34.807
And then all of a sudden
there was this razzmatazz.

48:38.812 --> 48:44.984
There was this surge, this tidal wave
of culture that suddenly dominated.

48:44.985 --> 48:48.238
<I>Suddenly, luck sparkled
in front of the world.</I>

48:51.909 --> 48:55.411
GARY: <I>I got</I> a <I>Union Jack guitar,
and I sent it to him to sign,</I>

48:55.412 --> 48:57.455
and I really should have known better,
to be fair.

48:57.456 --> 49:02.460
He sent it back with, "To Gary,
how many England caps do you deserve?

49:02.461 --> 49:05.630
"I'll tell you, none.
Lots of love, Noel Gallagher."

49:05.631 --> 49:07.215
And put "MCFC" all over it.

49:11.679 --> 49:15.014
<I>BOYLE: There was that feeling
in that few years preceding that,</I>

49:15.015 --> 49:17.725
<I>the public spirit had disappeared.</I>

49:17.726 --> 49:22.146
This long period of individuality,
of selfishness,

49:22.147 --> 49:23.731
there's no such thing as society.

49:23.732 --> 49:29.195
<I>That led inexorably to us wanting to
re-establish a sense of idealism.</I>

49:31.198 --> 49:35.243
<I>Seventeen years of hurt
never stopped us dreaming.</I>

49:35.244 --> 49:36.744
<I>Labour is coming home!</I>

49:39.999 --> 49:43.626
<I>TONY</I> BLAIR: <I>I was constantly aware
of the fact that I was young, very young.</I>

49:43.627 --> 49:46.379
And I remember the very first day
I came into Downing Street,

49:46.380 --> 49:48.756
going down to meet
the head of the Civil Service,

49:48.757 --> 49:52.885
who was much more senior figure
from the British establishment,

49:52.886 --> 49:58.224
and he looked at me and said,
"Well done. What now?"

49:58.225 --> 50:01.311
You don't realise until you look back
how important a time that was,

50:01.312 --> 50:04.272
and how fortunate you was
to be around the place in them days.

50:04.898 --> 50:09.110
<I>What those young players felt
was possible for them as players,</I>

50:09.111 --> 50:12.905
<I>there was a curious kind of echo
in culture, in art and in politics.</I>

50:13.657 --> 50:18.244
I mean, when I look back now and think of
the changes we made to the House of Lords,

50:18.245 --> 50:19.412
getting rid of the Hereditary Peers,

50:19.413 --> 50:21.622
<I>Scottish Devolution,
giving Scotland</I>

50:21.623 --> 50:23.374
<I>its first parliament,
and then peace in Northern Ireland,</I>

50:23.375 --> 50:24.751
sometimes I think

50:24.752 --> 50:28.588
what was great about the spirit
of that time was that

50:29.757 --> 50:33.593
what, on rational analysis was impossible,

50:34.094 --> 50:38.431
became imbued by a spirit of possibility
and was actually done.

50:38.432 --> 50:41.559
There was a kind of hope
crept back into everything

50:41.560 --> 50:45.438
and it was a great time of change,
and it's party time, you know.

50:45.439 --> 50:47.148
<I>It was good times.</I>

50:49.610 --> 50:51.069
The Stretford End gets knocked down

50:51.070 --> 50:54.572
and all of a sudden you've got this
massive big new stadium at Old Trafford.

50:54.573 --> 50:58.910
You've got stadiums going out
around the world, bigger and better.

50:58.911 --> 51:00.745
<I>Everything was getting bigger and better.</I>

51:00.746 --> 51:02.330
GARY: <I>The game became
completely different.</I>

51:02.331 --> 51:04.957
<I>The way in which it was viewed.
The way in which it was televised.</I>

51:04.958 --> 51:07.710
The money that came into the game.
The wages going up.

51:08.796 --> 51:12.965
BLAIR: <I>English soccer
became</I> a <I>major pan' of our identity.</I>

51:12.966 --> 51:16.886
Suddenly it went from something
that was politically kind of irrelevant

51:16.887 --> 51:20.473
to something that was
politically important.

51:20.474 --> 51:23.810
We were part, probably,
of a revolution, in a way.

51:23.811 --> 51:28.147
I suppose if you had to pick a footballer
to epitomise that, more than any,

51:28.148 --> 51:29.232
it would be David Beckham.

51:44.123 --> 51:48.167
I grew up in East London.
Born in Leytonstone.

51:48.168 --> 51:53.965
Lived in Leytonstone, right near
the dog track for about 10 years,

51:53.966 --> 51:56.843
and then we moved to Chingford,
posh part of East London.

51:56.844 --> 52:04.225
<I>We stayed there up until I left for Manchester,
which was when I was 15 years old.</I>

52:04.226 --> 52:08.479
My dad was a huge Man United fan,
all he talked about was United.

52:08.480 --> 52:10.523
His favourite player was Bobby Charlton.

52:10.524 --> 52:12.859
My middle name is Robert Joseph.

52:12.860 --> 52:17.530
"Robert" because of Bobby Charlton,
and "Joseph" because of my granddad.

52:18.073 --> 52:23.453
My granddad was a Tottenham fan. He'd
been a season ticket holder for 50 years.

52:23.454 --> 52:28.916
So at Christmas, my dad always used to buy
me a Man United kit, the new Man United kit.

52:28.917 --> 52:32.295
<I>And my granddad
always used to buy me the Tottenham kit.</I>

52:32.296 --> 52:35.173
What was it like when you signed?
How did you feel when you...

52:35.174 --> 52:38.593
it was brilliant.
Straight from when we left here.

52:39.303 --> 52:42.555
When we got there, it was just brilliant.

52:42.556 --> 52:44.724
Signing the paper and that.

52:45.309 --> 52:47.393
Just couldn't believe it was happening.

52:47.394 --> 52:49.896
Becks turned up to United,
and he looked like a Man United mascot.

52:49.897 --> 52:53.316
He had all the tracksuits, scarves, caps,
Bobby Charlton badges.

52:53.317 --> 52:55.651
But he was just a fanatic Man United fan.

52:56.236 --> 52:59.906
It was a weird experience
for us local lads to see

53:00.741 --> 53:04.744
a cockney lad knowing more
about United than we did.

53:05.579 --> 53:07.079
A bit embarrassing.

53:07.080 --> 53:10.416
<I>BECKHAM: Sir Alex Ferguson
would just call my mum and dad's house,</I>

53:10.417 --> 53:14.962
<I>and my mum would answer
and it would be this strong Scottish accent</I>

53:14.963 --> 53:19.425
saying, "Mrs Beckham, it's Alex Ferguson,"
and my mum would be like...

53:21.261 --> 53:24.805
To my dad, you know.
And my dad would be like, "No way".

53:24.806 --> 53:27.767
So my dad would come on the phone
and he'd just have a chat,

53:27.768 --> 53:31.604
say, "How's David doing?
How did he do last weekend?"

53:31.605 --> 53:35.191
And most of the time my dad would say,
"He did all right, but he can do better".

53:35.192 --> 53:36.667
Because that's what my dad did.

53:36.668 --> 53:40.296
And Brucey and Robbo
would just take the Mick out of him.

53:40.297 --> 53:42.298
<I>"Flipping heck, he must be some player.</I>

53:42.299 --> 53:44.133
<I>"What's he doing
in Man United's dressing room?"</I>

53:44.134 --> 53:46.594
I'd go in the changing room
and I'd help Norman

53:46.595 --> 53:50.139
pick up the dirty pants, the dirty socks,
the dirty shorts from the...

53:50.140 --> 53:51.557
I was loving it.

53:51.558 --> 53:53.642
It was Man United, Man United players

53:53.643 --> 53:56.979
just kind of dropping their underwear
on the floor,

53:56.980 --> 54:25.549
and I was grabbing it,
putting it in the box.

54:25.550 --> 54:27.176
MAN: And won't you miss home?

54:27.177 --> 54:32.598
I probably will miss it a little bit,
but I'll be doing what I want to do, so...

54:32.599 --> 54:36.143
What I've always admired about David
is his mental toughness is phenomenal.

54:36.144 --> 54:39.188
I mean, people can say whatever they want
about him who don't know him,

54:39.189 --> 54:47.770
but mental toughness, he's as tough
as anybody you'll ever, ever, ever meet.

54:47.771 --> 54:50.773
We all got given car deals with Honda.

54:51.358 --> 54:53.526
So we all had these Honda Preludes.

54:53.527 --> 54:57.363
I'd waited for so many months for that car,
so many years.

54:57.364 --> 55:01.242
You know, all the players had
had their car before me.

55:01.243 --> 55:05.747
I was literally...
I think you had to play 21 games,

55:05.748 --> 55:11.211
and I was on 18 or 19 for, like,
six or eight months, which was killing me.

55:11.212 --> 55:12.295
Because I was so close.

55:15.466 --> 55:20.720
I went down to Honda, ordered my car,
you know, came out with my Prelude.

55:20.721 --> 55:21.971
I was so happy with it.

55:21.972 --> 55:23.890
Becks had a black one.

55:24.433 --> 55:26.226
He paid extra for leather seats.

55:26.227 --> 55:27.644
I used my FA Cup bonus.

55:27.645 --> 55:30.939
I used every penny that I had.

55:30.940 --> 55:33.524
He paid extra for these special alloys.

55:33.525 --> 55:35.860
And the dealer, he said to me,

55:35.861 --> 55:39.614
he said, "You know that you have
to give this car back after a year?"

55:39.615 --> 55:40.907
And I was saying, "Yeah,
yeah, it'll be fine."

55:40.908 --> 55:42.992
We'd just use each other's cars.

55:42.993 --> 55:46.829
Every day we would use Becks',
'cause he had these leather seats.

55:46.830 --> 55:48.331
And he would go mad.

55:48.332 --> 55:51.125
Because we'd got our football boots on,
so we're dirtying his car.

55:51.126 --> 55:54.420
And he's, "Lads, lads,
don't scuff the leather, whatever you do."

55:54.421 --> 55:56.839
I can't actually remember saying it.

55:56.840 --> 56:00.009
But it sounds like something
that I would say.

56:00.010 --> 56:01.344
As soon as he said that,

56:01.345 --> 56:04.347
every day, we would stand outside his car,
"Are you ready, Becks?"

56:04.348 --> 56:05.765
"We're ready to go over."

56:05.766 --> 56:08.726
And he would have to drive over,
and we would just ruin his seats...

56:08.727 --> 56:12.647
Just ruin, you know,
put our studs over the seats.

56:12.648 --> 56:15.024
It got nicked in the end, the car.

56:15.025 --> 56:17.110
But it looked great while I had it.

56:19.863 --> 56:23.992
The goal he scored against Wimbledon, he
practised that in training every single day.

56:23.993 --> 56:26.035
Every single day he'd do that.

56:26.036 --> 56:27.537
Just booting balls from the halfway line.

56:27.538 --> 56:31.541
I call it booting, he was striking them,
from the halfway line, towards the goal.

56:31.542 --> 56:34.043
<I>Striking the ball, he was incredible.</I>

56:39.258 --> 56:41.759
<I>GIGGS: I was injured that game.</I>

56:41.760 --> 56:44.429
One of my mates said,
"Becks just scored from the halfway line."

56:44.430 --> 56:47.515
So I'm thinking, "Slight exaggeration.

56:47.516 --> 56:51.728
"Probably scored like, maybe on the angle
from 40 yards or something like that."

56:58.902 --> 57:02.155
I remember Eric Cantona just shaking
his head and I'm thinking,

57:02.156 --> 57:05.575
"That's Eric Cantona, and he obviously
thinks the goal was pretty good."

57:05.576 --> 57:09.329
The manager turned round to me and said,
"Lucky that went in."

57:09.330 --> 57:11.956
'Cause I think I would
have been pulled off.

57:11.957 --> 57:14.584
Even if he hadn't scored this goal,

57:16.170 --> 57:17.837
it was good idea.

57:19.631 --> 57:23.176
That was when I really all went like that
and the publicity went like that.

57:23.177 --> 57:26.554
It must have been zoomed
all around the world, that goal.

57:26.555 --> 57:28.681
The last person to do it
would have been Pele, I think.

57:28.682 --> 57:30.433
And even he didn't score it.

57:30.434 --> 57:33.394
And do you know something,
he wanted to be a star.

57:33.395 --> 57:37.065
He wanted to have leather in his car
when we had cloth.

57:37.608 --> 57:40.693
He wanted to have the best speakers
in his boot for the best music.

57:40.694 --> 57:42.779
He wanted to propel
himself beyond football.

57:42.780 --> 57:46.491
<I>Fashion was important to him.
Music was important to him.</I>

57:47.159 --> 57:50.078
Doing things more than just becoming
a football player were important to him.

57:53.290 --> 57:56.125
<I>GIGGS: I mean, Becks
was obviously a huge star</I>

57:56.126 --> 57:58.669
<I>and just got bigger and bigger and bigger.</I>

57:58.670 --> 58:04.258
But in regards to, in the dressing room,
not a lot changed. Becks was Becks.

58:04.259 --> 58:06.511
He had a lot going on.
You know, a lot of attention.

58:06.512 --> 58:10.348
He'd scored the goal against Wimbledon,
he was now going out with Victoria.

58:10.349 --> 58:15.061
They were a massive story, so everything
that they did, there was pressure on him.

58:15.062 --> 58:18.773
<I>You know, what he's achieved is incredible
in terms of his global appeal.</I>

58:18.774 --> 58:20.274
I mean, it's phenomenal.

58:20.275 --> 58:23.736
To think that that's a football player,
who can kick a football well.

58:23.737 --> 58:29.367
So I went to visit this obscure little
Japanese school in the middle of nowhere,

58:29.368 --> 58:33.121
and I went in and was introduced
to the school assembly.

58:35.165 --> 58:39.752
And I could see they hadn't
the faintest idea, frankly, who I was,

58:39.753 --> 58:45.007
I'm not really sure they could have pointed
to where Britain was on the map.

58:45.008 --> 58:48.594
And so finally, in desperation,
I uttered the words "David Beckham",

58:48.595 --> 58:52.974
and then there was immediate ripple
of recognition, and then you were away.

58:52.975 --> 58:55.268
A point of connection was established.

58:55.269 --> 58:58.521
Becks had always been
comfortable with that.

58:58.522 --> 59:03.693
Right from the start really,
where I wasn't as comfortable with it.

59:03.694 --> 59:06.362
<I>And I felt that it was
affecting my football.</I>

59:06.363 --> 59:11.075
<I>Becks did it in a way
that it didn't affect his football.</I>

59:11.076 --> 59:14.537
<I>And luckily for me, sort
of they left me alone,</I>

59:14.538 --> 59:18.416
and then Becks sort of
took it on to the next level.

59:18.417 --> 59:20.751
<I>GARY: I thought,
"How could he cope with this?"</I>

59:20.752 --> 59:23.004
<I>And he always did. He always did.</I>

59:23.005 --> 59:26.466
And you were always worried as a friend,
that... when would this have an impact?

59:30.304 --> 59:32.722
<I>We played really well. We
were playing great.</I>

59:36.059 --> 59:39.437
<I>And then I remember
being absolutely hit from behind.</I>

59:40.939 --> 59:42.565
I over-reacted,

59:44.526 --> 59:46.736
just kind of swung my leg up

59:48.655 --> 59:51.073
in a stupid way.

59:52.242 --> 59:55.578
As soon as I'd done that,
I knew that I was off.

59:55.579 --> 59:58.831
I knew that I'd made a huge mistake.

01:00:02.586 --> 01:00:03.920
<I>COMMENTATOR: Oh, it's red!</I>

01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:05.796
<I>Oh, no!</I>

01:00:07.925 --> 01:00:12.136
At the time I didn't realise
what would come after that.

01:00:12.137 --> 01:00:14.722
I never thought that I would have
to go through what I went through.

01:00:16.642 --> 01:00:20.728
<I>I remember being sat in the changing room,
no one was obviously in there.</I>

01:00:20.729 --> 01:00:24.857
<I>All the players came in
and I realised that we were knocked out.</I>

01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:27.693
None of the players said a word to me.

01:00:27.694 --> 01:00:32.865
The only people that spoke to me was Gary,
Scholesy, you know, the United players.

01:00:35.619 --> 01:00:39.580
And then Tony Adams came up to me
and put his arm round me.

01:00:39.581 --> 01:00:44.210
He said, "Do you know what, son?
Everyone makes mistakes. Forget it."

01:00:45.587 --> 01:00:48.381
I remember walking out
and seeing my mum and dad stood there.

01:00:48.382 --> 01:00:52.468
And I was 21, I think, at the time, 21, 22.

01:00:53.178 --> 01:00:57.473
And I remember literally falling
into my dad's arms, just... And I...

01:00:57.474 --> 01:01:01.519
I haven't sobbed like that

01:01:02.646 --> 01:01:04.105
for years.

01:01:04.106 --> 01:01:13.034
But I don't know,
my emotions just got the best of me.

01:01:13.035 --> 01:01:16.621
The boss called me and he said,
"Don't worry, son,

01:01:16.622 --> 01:01:21.001
"it's over, you'll come back,
you're a Manchester United player,

01:01:21.002 --> 01:01:24.087
"we'll look after you,
everyone's supporting you,

01:01:24.088 --> 01:01:25.839
"don't even worry about anything.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.676
"Go away, have a few weeks holiday,
get some rest,

01:01:29.677 --> 01:01:31.219
"but when you come back
to Manchester United,

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.179
"you know you've got the support
of everyone."

01:01:35.683 --> 01:01:40.937
David was the first England player
to receive that level of abuse

01:01:40.938 --> 01:01:44.399
for a mistake that someone had made
on a football field.

01:01:45.443 --> 01:01:48.778
<I>It was sickening, it was vile,
it was bordering on criminal,</I>

01:01:48.779 --> 01:01:50.530
<I>some of the things
that he had to put up with.</I>

01:01:51.657 --> 01:01:54.326
I had quite a few death threats.

01:01:54.327 --> 01:01:56.870
I had bullets through the post...

01:01:56.871 --> 01:02:03.418
Delivered, no address on them,
just hand-delivered through my letterbox.

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:06.379
It happened to my brother in 2000,
two years later.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.965
My brother gives away the penalty
against Romania...

01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:11.176
I got absolutely abused.

01:02:11.177 --> 01:02:15.096
Abused publicly, abused in the media.

01:02:16.098 --> 01:02:18.391
And I found it really difficult.

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.519
<I>My wife came home from work one day,</I>

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.522
<I>the gates were on fire
with an England flag on the gates.</I>

01:02:24.523 --> 01:02:26.399
You take your wife out for a romantic meal,

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.029
and you go to the toilet before the meal,
and you get threatened

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:32.238
to have your lights punched out,

01:02:32.239 --> 01:02:34.115
and then you go out
and you have to take your wife home.

01:02:34.116 --> 01:02:37.327
I had journalists turning round to
my granddad, turning round and saying,

01:02:37.328 --> 01:02:41.247
"Do you realise
what your grandson has done?"

01:02:41.749 --> 01:02:45.210
You know, for me
to have heard that,

01:02:46.003 --> 01:02:51.257
that made me feel worse than anything else.

01:02:51.258 --> 01:02:56.846
<I>PHIL: To be honest with you, what I suffered
was 10% of what he went through.</I>

01:02:56.847 --> 01:02:59.432
It affected me so much,
it knocked my confidence,

01:02:59.433 --> 01:03:03.436
<I>I needed to get some kind of
happiness for football back in my life.</I>

01:03:03.979 --> 01:03:05.772
<I>So I started to pray before matches.</I>

01:03:06.399 --> 01:03:08.942
I prayed that I'd make
my wife, my children,

01:03:08.943 --> 01:03:12.612
my mum and my dad, my sister, my brother
proud of what they were seeing

01:03:12.613 --> 01:03:15.532
from me out on the pitch,
and that's all I did.

01:03:15.533 --> 01:03:19.577
I said the same prayer every week
for the rest of my career.

01:03:20.705 --> 01:03:23.331
And he had the same attitude with Beckham,

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:26.084
when he was sent off with England,
with me when I was...

01:03:26.085 --> 01:03:30.630
sent off in Crystal Palace,
and the club had the same attitude.

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:34.759
I played for France this time.

01:03:35.302 --> 01:03:37.846
<I>Manchester United asked me
to sign a contract.</I>

01:03:38.556 --> 01:03:40.098
And I was banned for nine months.

01:03:40.891 --> 01:03:57.665
In France, completely opposite attitude.

01:03:57.666 --> 01:04:02.628
When things happen outside the club,
it's like everything just closes.

01:04:02.629 --> 01:04:05.089
You know, nothing gets
in, nothing gets out.

01:04:05.632 --> 01:04:06.924
The manager protects you.

01:04:06.925 --> 01:04:08.217
REPORTER: When will you allow Mr Beckham

01:04:08.218 --> 01:04:10.803
to talk about the incident
during the World Cup?

01:04:12.597 --> 01:04:16.183
Well, he doesn't need to talk about
anything. He's a Manchester United player.

01:04:17.185 --> 01:04:18.602
He can talk about Manchester United.

01:04:20.313 --> 01:04:22.022
<I>In French we say "merveilleux malheur".</I>

01:04:26.903 --> 01:04:30.406
Sometimes it happens,
something bad to you, but you use it.

01:04:31.324 --> 01:04:32.866
And the way you will take,

01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:36.662
it will be even better
than the way you will have taken

01:04:36.663 --> 01:04:38.497
if it didn't happen.

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:44.378
(SCATTING)

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.548
Oh, the new kit's out.

01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:48.841
Sad day.

01:04:49.551 --> 01:04:51.427
Not a sad day.

01:04:51.428 --> 01:04:53.429
Is that the new kit? Oh, Scholesy.

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:55.931
First time you've not been in here
for how long?

01:04:55.932 --> 01:04:57.599
20 years.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.560
Giggs is still there, though.

01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:01.353
Ashley Young's.

01:05:01.354 --> 01:05:03.731
Should I sit where I used to sit?

01:05:04.357 --> 01:05:05.566
Are you sat in your seats?

01:05:05.567 --> 01:05:06.942
- Yeah.
- Sat in my seat, yeah.

01:05:06.943 --> 01:05:08.319
They're sat in their seats,
they've done me over.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.862
You're sat next to the keeper,
aren't you, Gaz?

01:05:09.863 --> 01:05:10.904
Here.

01:05:23.001 --> 01:05:25.377
BOBBY CHARLTON: What's going to happen
over the next two weeks,

01:05:25.378 --> 01:05:31.759
if we're successful,
could be the most momentous 10 days,

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.344
you know, in the club's history.

01:05:33.345 --> 01:05:36.263
Maybe in any English team's
history as well, you know,

01:05:36.264 --> 01:05:40.392
because the Champions League,
the FA Cup, the Championship.

01:05:40.393 --> 01:05:42.353
It's there for us.

01:05:42.354 --> 01:05:43.812
Yeah, with the Tottenham game

01:05:43.813 --> 01:05:47.858
it was the first game of three cup finals,
that's how we...

01:05:47.859 --> 01:05:52.112
It's 10 days, three games.
You win them, history. It's...

01:05:52.113 --> 01:05:55.282
You know, sounds simple,
but that's what it was really.

01:05:55.283 --> 01:06:00.371
The fact that we had to beat Tottenham
kind of meant more to me

01:06:00.372 --> 01:06:01.830
than probably most of the other lads.

01:06:02.957 --> 01:06:07.294
<I>COMMENTATOR: The league title,
their starter for three, is within reach.</I>

01:06:07.295 --> 01:06:10.506
<I>Manchester United have put themselves
within touching distance,</I>

01:06:10.507 --> 01:06:14.968
<I>can Tottenham Hotspur, of all people,
open the door for Arsenal?</I>

01:06:16.137 --> 01:06:18.680
<I>SCHOLES: Up to half time I could have
scored three, four, five goals,</I>

01:06:18.681 --> 01:06:20.849
<I>I had that many chances
and, you know, blew it.</I>

01:06:22.143 --> 01:06:24.853
GIGGS: <I>Of course, United being United,
you have to do it the hard way.</I>

01:06:24.854 --> 01:06:26.772
Go 1-nil down.

01:06:26.773 --> 01:06:29.316
You know, that's not in the script,
you know, what's going on?

01:06:29.984 --> 01:06:33.278
<I>I had a great chance with my head
and skied it.</I>

01:06:33.279 --> 01:06:37.116
And all of a sudden you kind of think,
"it's not going to be our day,

01:06:37.117 --> 01:06:39.535
"we're going to blow it
on the last game of the season."

01:06:39.536 --> 01:06:41.161
And then you just look for heroes.

01:06:41.162 --> 01:06:43.622
Tottenham seemed to bring out
the best in Becks.

01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:45.082
He used to always score great goals.

01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:48.669
Whatever stadium you are in the world,
when the ball comes to him,

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.839
you know because he's practised so hard
throughout his career,

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.926
he's going to produce that same technique,
same quality.

01:06:55.927 --> 01:06:57.636
<I>COMMENTATOR: Giggs to Scholes.</I>

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.139
<I>Scholes to Beckham.</I>

01:07:01.558 --> 01:07:03.767
<I>It's in! It's 1-1!</I>

01:07:03.768 --> 01:07:05.644
<I>It's David Beckham!</I>

01:07:07.188 --> 01:07:11.442
It was a great goal, great technique,
everything what David was about, really.

01:07:11.443 --> 01:07:15.237
Becks doesn't get the credit
for some of the goals he scored.

01:07:15.238 --> 01:07:19.741
He got robbed in the FA Cup semi-final,
because I scored the goal,

01:07:19.742 --> 01:07:24.079
everyone forgets about his goal,
his 25-yard bending it past David Seaman.

01:07:24.873 --> 01:07:28.083
The Tottenham goal was just...
(BLOWING RASPBERRY)

01:07:29.127 --> 01:07:30.377
Only Becks can score it.

01:07:30.378 --> 01:07:34.715
It's like a whip-ping,
it's just a ridiculous goal.

01:07:34.716 --> 01:07:36.341
- Then you scored.
- Yeah.

01:07:36.342 --> 01:07:39.636
Just before half time.
And then it just sort of lifted everything.

01:07:39.637 --> 01:07:42.181
- I missed a load of chances as well.
- We had so many chances, didn't we?

01:07:42.182 --> 01:07:43.765
- I had about four or five chances.
- Did you?

01:07:43.766 --> 01:07:45.225
Great chances, yeah.

01:07:45.226 --> 01:07:48.687
I got a bit of a roasting at half time,
I remember, for that game.

01:07:49.522 --> 01:07:51.440
"How many chances
do you want to score here?"

01:07:51.441 --> 01:07:53.233
Nothing was going right for us.

01:07:53.234 --> 01:07:55.402
Scholesy obviously had a few chances.

01:07:55.403 --> 01:07:57.529
It'd never happened before,

01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:59.281
that we'd actually won it here,
at Old Trafford.

01:07:59.282 --> 01:08:01.074
Did you set the goal up, Gaz?

01:08:01.075 --> 01:08:04.745
Yeah. A left-foot hoik.
It was a wonderful hoik.

01:08:04.746 --> 01:08:07.247
It was a cultured pass
into his path, I thought.

01:08:07.248 --> 01:08:09.875
My left-foot hoik down the channel
to Coley, that he scored from.

01:08:09.876 --> 01:08:11.752
Yeah, it was a big long ball, wasn't it?

01:08:11.753 --> 01:08:13.170
A fluke.

01:08:13.171 --> 01:08:14.588
If Scholes or Beckham had done that pass,

01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:16.965
honestly, it would have been
talked about forever more.

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:19.676
SCHOLES: You leave a big divot, though.

01:08:20.636 --> 01:08:21.803
SCHOLES: A big nine-iron.

01:08:21.804 --> 01:08:23.971
And the fact I hadn't looked
before I played it.

01:08:25.183 --> 01:08:28.100
It was a wonderful pass. it was Platini.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:33.273
It was just a hoof down the channel,
and Coley just dinked it over.

01:08:34.192 --> 01:08:36.944
<I>And then it's 2-1, and you're thinking,
"Right, we're at it."</I>

01:08:36.944 --> 01:08:39.446
But then we were hanging on
towards the end because we just...

01:08:39.447 --> 01:08:40.906
We still needed to win.

01:08:40.907 --> 01:08:44.451
And I remember being in the centre circle
when the whistle went, I fell to my knees

01:08:44.452 --> 01:08:47.828
and kind of held my hands in the air,
and I turned around

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:51.542
and Butty, literally, comes along, lifts...

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:54.252
Grabs me by the shirt, lifts me up,
and we celebrate.

01:08:54.254 --> 01:08:57.171
Those are the special moments
that I know my granddad

01:08:57.173 --> 01:08:59.299
would have been kind of swearing at me,

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.345
but then also kind of really happy at the
fact that I was going to win a league.

01:09:04.346 --> 01:09:06.473
And I think he'd have been
even more happier,

01:09:06.474 --> 01:09:09.268
just because it'd have either meant
us winning the league

01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:10.978
or Arsenal winning the league.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.604
And as a Tottenham fan,

01:09:12.604 --> 01:09:14.898
he was happy that Man United
was winning the league.

01:09:15.733 --> 01:09:19.861
I mean, with Becks scoring that goal,
it was the full turn-around really

01:09:19.862 --> 01:09:24.157
from the start of the season,
all the World Cup carry-on,

01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:25.533
the backlash from that,

01:09:25.535 --> 01:09:27.202
to having a brilliant season

01:09:27.203 --> 01:09:31.331
and finishing it with such an
important goal in the league decider.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:34.334
And, you know, one ticked off the list,
two to go.

01:10:00.194 --> 01:10:04.406
<I>I grew up on a place called Langley
in Middleton,</I>

01:10:04.407 --> 01:10:07.242
<I>it's just</I> a <I>council estate
really,</I> a <I>rough</I> area.

01:10:07.243 --> 01:10:08.619
I didn't think it was a rough area.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.497
People from outside probably do,
but it wasn't the nicest of places,

01:10:12.498 --> 01:10:16.501
I don't suppose,
but it's where I grew up and I...

01:10:16.502 --> 01:10:17.878
I enjoyed it.

01:10:17.879 --> 01:10:21.965
We had like a square
at the end of our street, and a big fence,

01:10:21.966 --> 01:10:24.551
I would just boot a ball
against that all day and...

01:10:25.511 --> 01:10:28.722
Then the neighbours tried to ban me.
Tried to stop me playing and...

01:10:28.723 --> 01:10:31.433
I think there was always arguments
with my dad and the next-door neighbour

01:10:31.434 --> 01:10:33.060
about stopping me from playing.

01:10:33.895 --> 01:10:37.064
Then you get the "No ball games" sign,
don%you?

01:10:37.065 --> 01:10:39.358
You're not allowed to play any more,
you have to go off,

01:10:39.359 --> 01:10:41.068
try and play football wherever you can.

01:10:42.236 --> 01:10:44.905
He's hard to explain, Scholesy,

01:10:44.906 --> 01:10:47.115
because there's probably
three or four different sides to him.

01:10:47.116 --> 01:10:49.826
As a character he was always quiet,

01:10:49.827 --> 01:10:53.830
but, you know, with this dry
sense of humour, and one-liners.

01:10:53.831 --> 01:10:56.583
<I>Finished training, straight off home.</I>

01:10:56.584 --> 01:10:58.752
<I>You know, we would joke,
"Where's Scholesy gone?"</I>

01:10:58.753 --> 01:11:00.462
<I>Didn't even see him leave.</I>

01:11:00.463 --> 01:11:05.425
Goes back in his Bat Cave, in his room,
his packet of Wine Gums, his Minstrels,

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:09.388
his M&Ms, whatever he has,
watches his telly.

01:11:09.389 --> 01:11:11.973
And the next time you'd see him
is if you go round to his room,

01:11:11.974 --> 01:11:14.101
and you'd go in his room, and it was funny

01:11:14.102 --> 01:11:17.020
because whatever time of day
you'd go into Paul Scholes' room,

01:11:17.021 --> 01:11:20.399
it'd be pitch black.
The curtains would be closed.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.106
He'd be in bed, with his shorts on,
pitch black with the telly on.

01:11:36.624 --> 01:11:40.252
But I suppose for me, Scholesy,
I love that. It's just very romantic,

01:11:40.253 --> 01:11:44.214
that idea of a guy who doesn't really care
about all this, not so much.

01:11:44.215 --> 01:11:46.049
Not really bothered about all that, really.

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:50.011
Just wants to play the game,
get on with it and live a normal life.

01:11:50.012 --> 01:11:53.014
I think a lot of us
relate to that, you know.

01:11:53.015 --> 01:11:55.559
People ask me to do interviews

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.020
and I don't have to do them,
to me it's just not necessary.

01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:03.358
All I wanted to do was play football

01:12:03.359 --> 01:12:07.147
and I never realised
that all that side came with it, really.

01:12:07.148 --> 01:12:11.735
There is nothing more beautiful
than seeing him arrive in that hole,

01:12:11.736 --> 01:12:14.696
everybody is faffing about
in the penalty area,

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:17.365
there's a big hole outside
the penalty area,

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:20.076
outside the penalty box,
and there he is arriving.

01:12:21.078 --> 01:12:22.746
<I>COMMENTATOR: Back for Scholes. Oh!</I>

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:26.583
That's one of the kind of great moments
in life, I think,

01:12:26.584 --> 01:12:29.085
seeing Paul Scholes arise for a screamer.

01:12:29.086 --> 01:12:33.423
The best way that I found it
was to try and keep things as simple as...

01:12:33.424 --> 01:12:35.842
as they possibly could be.

01:12:35.843 --> 01:12:38.511
I think the minute you start trying to do
things you can't...

01:12:38.512 --> 01:12:40.221
you're not good at, like,

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:44.267
say if I went started trying dribbling, trying
to beat people, it'd be a waste of time.

01:12:44.268 --> 01:12:46.936
I mean, if you know Scholesy,
you just don't turn your back on him.

01:12:48.356 --> 01:12:50.940
You know, you go out and train,
we'd be on a field

01:12:50.941 --> 01:12:54.944
and if you needed a piss or something,
you'd go over in the bushes.

01:12:54.945 --> 01:12:56.237
But you'd never turn your back.

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:59.908
I mean, you learnt that as a young player,
you never turn your back, so you'd be...

01:13:00.493 --> 01:13:01.785
You know, you'd be...

01:13:01.786 --> 01:13:04.954
I always try and hit someone
on the back of the head.

01:13:04.955 --> 01:13:06.206
Not intentionally...

01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:07.374
Well, a little bit intentionally,

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:09.417
just aim for them
if they weren't quite watching.

01:13:10.628 --> 01:13:15.048
GIGGS: <I>You'd go over and Scholesy
would just be peppering balls at them.</I>

01:13:15.049 --> 01:13:18.927
<I>And now and again he'd obviously hit you.
More often than not, actually.</I>

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:21.971
So, if you were new,
or if you were a foreign player,

01:13:21.972 --> 01:13:26.309
and you didn't know Scholesy,
you soon got to know,

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.437
if you're going to have a piss,
then don't turn your back.

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:32.482
One day I did catch Phil Neville
with a beauty, actually.

01:13:32.483 --> 01:13:35.485
It was about 60 yards away,
right on the other side of the pitch,

01:13:35.486 --> 01:13:38.530
and I think he was doing
a bit of extra running after training.

01:13:38.531 --> 01:13:39.823
<I>A few of the lads were sat down.</I>

01:13:39.824 --> 01:13:43.660
I've smacked a ball
and it's just hit him full on the head

01:13:43.661 --> 01:13:45.995
and he's gone down eating grass
and everything.

01:13:45.996 --> 01:13:49.332
We're just on the floor pissing ourselves,

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:52.127
and he didn't have a clue
which one of us it was.

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:53.795
It was one of them perfect moments.

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:58.842
But like I say, I just saw that
as a bit of passing practice, really.

01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:10.687
The FA Cup final to me,
and probably to you lot as well,

01:14:10.688 --> 01:14:12.439
growing up as a kid it's...

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:17.569
It's something you look forward to.
The twin towers at Wembley, the...

01:14:18.571 --> 01:14:21.448
Just the full day, I think,
getting up from 9:00 in the morning,

01:14:21.449 --> 01:14:22.866
whoever is playing in it,

01:14:22.867 --> 01:14:25.368
it was just the biggest day
of the football year for me.

01:14:26.287 --> 01:14:30.665
It was the biggest thing in my eyes
as a kid, was the FA Cup final,

01:14:31.876 --> 01:14:37.088
and trying to think about being able
to be involved in one, or a couple of them,

01:14:37.089 --> 01:14:39.048
was just something
you'd laugh about as a kid.

01:14:39.049 --> 01:14:41.217
If you told your teacher
you were going to do that,

01:14:41.218 --> 01:14:44.608
he'd probably piss himself laughing at you.

01:14:44.609 --> 01:14:46.902
<I>COMMENTATOR: The FA Cup final is the
time-honoured finale to the domestic season.</I>

01:14:50.782 --> 01:14:54.242
<I>But if Manchester United can complete
the English double here today,</I>

01:14:54.243 --> 01:14:58.872
a <I>European treble,</I> a <I>unique treble,
falls within their compass...</I>

01:14:58.873 --> 01:15:04.002
<I>GARY: So the FA Cup final comes on
the Saturday, and we just want peace.</I>

01:15:04.003 --> 01:15:07.839
<I>We were playing against Newcastle,
and you just want a comfortable game.</I>

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.594
You never get that in an FA Cup final,
it's always nervy, it's always tense.

01:15:12.595 --> 01:15:14.596
<I>But we got a comfortable game.</I>

01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:16.348
<I>We played really well in the first half.</I>

01:15:16.349 --> 01:15:19.893
<I>We lost Keaney after about 20 minutes,
which was</I> a <I>blow.</I>

01:15:19.894 --> 01:15:21.228
<I>Then Teddy came on.</I>

01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:23.939
<I>Even in adversity,
things that went wrong for us</I>

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:26.274
<I>ended up being a positive,
because the lad that came on scored.</I>

01:15:27.735 --> 01:15:31.196
<I>COMMENTATOR: Scholes...
That's perfect for Sheringham!</I>

01:15:31.197 --> 01:15:33.740
<I>The substitute scores instantly!</I>

01:15:33.741 --> 01:15:38.286
<I>And Paul Scholes, who won't
have any part to play in Barcelona sadly,</I>

01:15:38.287 --> 01:15:41.456
<I>played a big part in that goal!</I>

01:15:41.457 --> 01:15:44.209
And Scholesy manages to do
what he normally does,

01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:46.128
scores big goals on big occasions.

01:15:48.589 --> 01:15:52.884
Not just to play in one,
but to score in an FA Cup final was...

01:15:52.885 --> 01:15:54.928
To me, it's the best thing I've done.

01:15:55.805 --> 01:15:59.141
<I>COMMENTATOR: Sheringham... Scholes!
It's two.</I>

01:15:59.142 --> 01:16:03.895
GIGGS: <I>I think, again, like Scholesy,
it sort of goes under the radar, that goal.</I>

01:16:03.896 --> 01:16:07.107
<I>PHIL: Pan' of me thinks that he was happy
that it was sandwiched in between</I>

01:16:07.108 --> 01:16:09.609
<I>two of the biggest games.
He scored the winning goal.</I>

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:11.736
<I>Normally, if you score
the winning goal in the cup final,</I>

01:16:11.737 --> 01:16:13.989
<I>your face is on the front page
of the newspapers</I>

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.574
<I>and you're shown all summer.</I>

01:16:15.575 --> 01:16:19.452
And it just got lost in the euphoria
of the previous seven days

01:16:19.453 --> 01:16:21.496
and the next three days.

01:16:21.497 --> 01:16:25.750
And it sums up Scholesy's character
in a way, because he wasn't bothered,

01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:30.505
and this was a lad that just scored
the winning goal, FA Cup final. Go home.

01:16:30.506 --> 01:16:33.675
Play with his kids. Have a beer.
End of story.

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:42.350
One thing that the times did represent,
and in a way those individuals represented,

01:16:43.102 --> 01:16:47.731
was an understanding that although
we lived in more individualistic times,

01:16:47.732 --> 01:16:51.943
yet there was still a unique capacity

01:16:51.944 --> 01:16:54.779
to be greater together than you were alone.

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:59.284
I think in our eyes we were just playing
a game of football with our mates.

01:16:59.285 --> 01:17:01.077
I know it sounds a bit...

01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:05.081
Sounds a bit stupid when you think,
"God, you're playing for Man United,"

01:17:05.082 --> 01:17:07.959
but we were lucky enough
to play well together,

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.837
and at the same time are playing
for the biggest club in the world.

01:17:10.838 --> 01:17:12.088
<I>We bounced off each other.</I>

01:17:12.089 --> 01:17:14.549
We were all pals, we all went out,
socialised together.

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:17.260
We'd even go out
with our girlfriends in groups.

01:17:17.261 --> 01:17:18.637
We was just

01:17:18.638 --> 01:17:22.974
six young lads who were enjoying life
like you couldn't believe, really.

01:17:22.975 --> 01:17:24.851
It was just one of them...
It was like a dream.

01:17:24.852 --> 01:17:28.480
<I>BECKHAM: No matter where we were from,
no matter how we were brought up,</I>

01:17:28.481 --> 01:17:32.525
no matter what we'd been through,
through our B-Team, A-Team,

01:17:32.526 --> 01:17:36.655
reserve-team years,
we all had each other's back.

01:17:36.656 --> 01:17:38.782
When you talk about brothers,
me and my brother,

01:17:38.783 --> 01:17:41.451
it wasn't just that,
everyone was like a brother.

01:17:41.452 --> 01:17:43.578
You know, whether you'd grown up
through the ranks,

01:17:43.579 --> 01:17:45.956
or it was a team-mate
that had been bought in,

01:17:45.957 --> 01:17:47.165
you really looked after one.

01:17:47.166 --> 01:17:51.753
If someone got hurt, we always tried
to make sure we got the person back,

01:17:52.755 --> 01:17:54.839
and it was usually Nicky that did.

01:18:05.977 --> 01:18:08.979
<I>Yeah, growing up in Gorton
was just a joy, really.</I>

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.232
I was always with all my mates,
it was a real working-class place.

01:18:12.858 --> 01:18:14.526
You know, everyone looked after each other.

01:18:14.527 --> 01:18:17.028
<I>No matter where you went,
the doors were always open.</I>

01:18:17.029 --> 01:18:21.283
Butty's from Gorton, and I think
it's where they filmed Shameless,

01:18:21.284 --> 01:18:22.951
so it gives you a bit
of an idea of the area.

01:18:22.952 --> 01:18:25.912
<I>But obviously Butty is proud
of where he comes from.</I>

01:18:25.913 --> 01:18:29.916
<I>I think one of his first cars was an Orion.</I>

01:18:29.917 --> 01:18:32.043
I remember getting in it once,

01:18:32.044 --> 01:18:35.714
and I looked down,
and there's a chain about that thick.

01:18:36.882 --> 01:18:38.550
"Butty, what is that?"

01:18:38.551 --> 01:18:42.262
He went, "No, no, where I live,
you've got to have one of these."

01:18:42.263 --> 01:18:45.724
And he used to wrap it round the gearstick,
wrap it round the steering wheel,

01:18:45.725 --> 01:18:48.893
and it was the thickest chain...
I'm surprised that the car could even move.

01:18:48.894 --> 01:18:52.897
It was like an anchor,
and it was just purely for security.

01:18:53.482 --> 01:18:57.277
<I>SCHOLES: He was a tough lad,
he was streetwise.</I>

01:18:57.278 --> 01:19:02.407
If there was ever any trouble, then you knew
you could just look to your right or left

01:19:02.408 --> 01:19:04.826
and Nicky would be there to sort it out.

01:19:04.827 --> 01:19:07.245
I think he looked after Gary
a few times as well, actually.

01:19:07.246 --> 01:19:11.249
Down tunnels, it's always nice to have
a couple of lads alongside you, isn't it?

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:12.625
<I>He wasn't the biggest, Butty.</I>

01:19:12.626 --> 01:19:15.962
<I>But he had good technique of how
to get into people, you know what I mean?</I>

01:19:15.963 --> 01:19:17.856
<I>You know, people know how to hit people.</I>

01:19:17.857 --> 01:19:22.110
Nicky, at youth level,
was the best player in the team.

01:19:22.111 --> 01:19:23.820
<I>He had an unbelievable temperament,</I>

01:19:23.821 --> 01:19:26.615
<I>he could play on any stage,
at any level, and not be phased.</I>

01:19:30.953 --> 01:19:33.246
BUTT: We started thinking
this is going to be magical,

01:19:33.247 --> 01:19:38.001
probably after the FA Cup,
'cause all the hype was about the treble,

01:19:38.002 --> 01:19:39.544
but we never really mentioned it.

01:19:39.545 --> 01:19:41.129
Everyone must have
thought about it deep down,

01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:43.632
but it never got...
it never come out vocally.

01:19:44.133 --> 01:19:46.635
We had a big problem,

01:19:46.636 --> 01:19:51.556
because Keane and Scholes were banned
for the final of the European Cup.

01:19:51.557 --> 01:19:53.100
<I>COMMENTATOR: Scholes tackle.</I>

01:19:53.101 --> 01:19:54.226
<I>Well, he won the ball.</I>

01:19:55.728 --> 01:20:00.232
<I>But the ref... Oh, it's a yellow card! And
he'll miss the final if United get there.</I>

01:20:00.233 --> 01:20:03.819
I knew from that point
I wasn't going to be available

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.196
for the Champions League final,
and that was that.

01:20:06.197 --> 01:20:08.198
Nothing I could do about it.

01:20:08.199 --> 01:20:10.575
Do you know what I mean?
Obviously you're disappointed at the time,

01:20:10.576 --> 01:20:12.994
a little bit disappointed
in the dressing room,

01:20:12.995 --> 01:20:15.038
but the most important thing
was that we'd got there.

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:19.167
I think the biggest disappointment
was Roy missing it,

01:20:19.168 --> 01:20:21.795
'cause he had been so
good in that semi-final

01:20:21.796 --> 01:20:25.966
that it was going to be major problem
for us really, not having Roy.

01:20:40.314 --> 01:20:41.982
<I>PHIL: We needed someone...</I>

01:20:41.983 --> 01:20:45.277
<I>We needed someone that was willing
to take the fight to Bayern Munich,</I>

01:20:45.278 --> 01:20:49.322
<I>and in Nicky Butt we had the
perfect person. He's fearless.</I>

01:20:49.323 --> 01:20:52.200
You know, you go to war,
you take Nicky Butt with you.

01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:57.289
You know, the manager told him,
"Forget the FA Cup final. Forget it.

01:20:57.290 --> 01:21:00.208
"You're playing in the Champions League
final. You know, I can't risk it."

01:21:00.209 --> 01:21:02.878
BUTT: <I>I was distraught, I was thinking...
I was devastated.</I>

01:21:02.879 --> 01:21:05.630
<I>I was thinking, I was just saying to
the manager, "Well, it's the FA Cup."</I>

01:21:05.631 --> 01:21:07.841
<I>But I knew, ultimately, the end,</I>

01:21:07.842 --> 01:21:11.511
<I>the reward at the end was massive
for myself. And the club.</I>

01:21:12.472 --> 01:21:17.267
GIGGS: <I>He's the, you know, the only
real proper centre midfielder in the team.</I>

01:21:17.268 --> 01:21:20.520
<I>So there was a big of pressure on him as well,
and it was against a very good team.</I>

01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:24.691
<I>FERGUSON: They're showing
their character now.</I>

01:21:24.692 --> 01:21:29.946
The team spirit has been fantastic
since beating Liverpool in the cup tie.

01:21:29.947 --> 01:21:32.699
<I>Sort of a focus on the essential</I>

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.577
<I>of never giving in,
and team spirit, and determination.</I>

01:21:36.621 --> 01:21:39.664
I was completely on my arse,
and I had to sell my Lambretta.

01:21:39.665 --> 01:21:43.460
My most prized possession
is my Lambretta scooter,

01:21:43.461 --> 01:21:46.588
and I sold it on the Monday,
the game was on the Wednesday.

01:21:46.589 --> 01:21:49.758
And then booked us
on a week's holiday to Salou,

01:21:49.759 --> 01:21:53.720
and then get 400 quid each for a ticket.
I was like, the crowd we were in...

01:21:53.721 --> 01:21:56.264
It was any means necessary, you know.

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:04.606
<I>PHIL: The Nou Camp is one
of the iconic venues.</I>

01:22:04.607 --> 01:22:07.442
It wasn't plush, it was pretty old, really.

01:22:07.443 --> 01:22:10.904
You go down the tunnel,
it was bare concrete walls.

01:22:10.905 --> 01:22:13.114
<I>On the right-hand side
there's a little room,</I>

01:22:13.115 --> 01:22:17.077
<I>it's like a little chapel
where you go in and pray.</I>

01:22:17.078 --> 01:22:18.870
Before you're going out to get killed,

01:22:18.871 --> 01:22:20.664
you've got to go in
and say a prayer first type thing,

01:22:20.665 --> 01:22:23.416
and then you come
to the bottom of the tunnel,

01:22:23.417 --> 01:22:25.627
and at the Nou Camp the steps go up.

01:22:25.628 --> 01:22:30.131
And as you're coming up the steps,
all you can see is the stadium above you.

01:22:30.132 --> 01:22:33.885
<I>COMMENTATOR: Manchester United were the first
English club to lift the European Cup,</I>

01:22:33.886 --> 01:22:38.723
<I>but no Manchester United team,
no English team, has ever won this treble.</I>

01:22:38.724 --> 01:22:41.142
<I>History beckons tonight.</I>

01:22:41.143 --> 01:22:43.270
<I>The amount of Man United fans
that were there was phenomenal</I>

01:22:43.271 --> 01:22:46.314
<I>compared to Munich.
We took up three-quarters of the ground.</I>

01:22:46.315 --> 01:22:49.484
You knew you were in a massive game then,
and then you just look for your family,

01:22:49.485 --> 01:22:52.571
give them a little wave
and then it's just game on then.

01:22:52.572 --> 01:22:53.822
This is it for us.

01:22:53.823 --> 01:22:58.868
This is the moment where we either become
Manchester United legends,

01:22:58.869 --> 01:23:02.289
or we just win the league and the FA Cup.

01:23:03.291 --> 01:23:07.085
GIGGS: <I>The game didn't go great,
obviously, with the start.</I>

01:23:07.086 --> 01:23:10.338
<I>And they were such a powerful team,
such an experienced team,</I>

01:23:10.339 --> 01:23:12.132
that you thought, back of your mind,

01:23:12.133 --> 01:23:15.093
"Is it one too many
to come back in this game?

01:23:15.094 --> 01:23:18.346
<I>"We'd done it so much,
have we run out of luck?</I>

01:23:18.347 --> 01:23:20.390
<I>"Have we run out of something,</I>

01:23:20.975 --> 01:23:22.934
<I>"um, at the crucial point?"</I>

01:23:22.935 --> 01:23:25.186
<I>COMMENTATOR: And Manchester United,
as they've done</I>

01:23:25.187 --> 01:23:27.897
<I>time and time again on this European run,</I>

01:23:27.898 --> 01:23:29.649
<I>have made it hard for themselves.</I>

01:23:31.027 --> 01:23:34.571
At half-time, I remember
the manager sitting down with us,

01:23:34.572 --> 01:23:38.700
and I could tell, you know, there was a few
nerves throughout the team and players.

01:23:39.285 --> 01:23:43.038
He told us, "Just think how you would feel

01:23:43.039 --> 01:23:46.124
"if you had to walk past
that Champions League trophy

01:23:46.125 --> 01:23:49.085
"and you couldn't touch it,
you couldn't pick it up.

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.379
"You know, you hadn't won it.

01:23:51.881 --> 01:23:57.385
"So, if you're feeling tired,
or if you feel like you can't run any more,

01:23:57.386 --> 01:23:58.511
"just think Of that."

01:23:58.512 --> 01:24:01.765
<I>"Just think of having to walk past it
and you can't pick it up,</I>

01:24:01.766 --> 01:24:03.850
<I>"you can't touch it, you can't kiss it."</I>

01:24:05.144 --> 01:24:07.187
<I>GARY: The only doubts that I ever had</I>

01:24:07.188 --> 01:24:10.231
<I>were probably in the last half an hour
of the Champions League final.</I>

01:24:10.733 --> 01:24:12.859
Because Bayern Munich
were still getting chances.

01:24:13.402 --> 01:24:15.737
They were hitting the bar,
they were hitting the post.

01:24:16.614 --> 01:24:20.367
And we weren't playing well.
Things weren't happening for us.

01:24:20.368 --> 01:24:23.578
We weren't getting our crosses in.
I wasn't overlapping.

01:24:23.579 --> 01:24:25.830
Giggsy wasn't getting his dribbles in.

01:24:25.831 --> 01:24:28.750
We didn't have the combinations
between Yorke and Cole.

01:24:28.751 --> 01:24:31.586
Things that we'd done all year...
The moment...

01:24:31.587 --> 01:24:33.755
There was no momentum in the game.

01:24:33.756 --> 01:24:35.590
<I>And all of a sudden,
with about 15 minutes to go,</I>

01:24:35.591 --> 01:24:37.676
<I>Becks came out to the right-hand side.</I>

01:24:37.677 --> 01:24:39.761
<I>We made a couple of changes.</I>

01:24:39.762 --> 01:24:41.805
<I>Teddy came on. Ole came on.</I>

01:24:41.806 --> 01:24:45.433
And all of a sudden I
thought, "Here we go."

01:24:47.436 --> 01:24:49.521
<I>It was disaster for the club,
Roy Keane missing it.</I>

01:24:49.522 --> 01:24:51.523
Disaster for Roy Keane.

01:24:51.524 --> 01:24:55.110
But maybe that was God's way of saying
this is Nicky Butt's moment.

01:24:56.737 --> 01:25:00.365
If people ever sort of doubted,
how good a player Butty was,

01:25:00.366 --> 01:25:03.535
then that shows everything
about the player,

01:25:03.536 --> 01:25:06.287
because he was just a rock that night.

01:25:07.456 --> 01:25:09.124
<I>MANI: He was immense. I was there.</I>

01:25:09.125 --> 01:25:10.375
What a guy.

01:25:10.376 --> 01:25:12.377
Gorton, there you go.

01:25:12.378 --> 01:25:15.004
He's from Manchester.
He knows what it meant.

01:25:15.005 --> 01:25:16.172
You know what I mean?

01:25:16.173 --> 01:25:18.258
But if it goes back
to fundamentally what it was about,

01:25:18.259 --> 01:25:20.385
it was about us keeping driving forward,
keep attacking.

01:25:20.386 --> 01:25:22.887
We got corner after corner
after corner and...

01:25:23.472 --> 01:25:27.475
And with people like Becks on the pitch
to put balls in like that,

01:25:27.476 --> 01:25:31.229
and the attacking power we had,
and the aerial power we had,

01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:33.148
you know, it should only
be a matter of time.

01:25:33.774 --> 01:25:37.819
<I>GARY: Manchester United teams under
Sir Alex Ferguson always went to the end.</I>

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:41.322
<I>Always. Because we always felt,
"Get one goal, we'll always get another.</I>

01:25:41.323 --> 01:25:42.699
<I>"We'll always get a chance."</I>

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:46.453
Three minutes to go,
"Don't panic, we always get a chance."

01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:50.248
<I>COMMENTATOR: Three added minutes.
David Beckham.</I>

01:25:51.417 --> 01:25:52.959
<I>Now Gary Neville.</I>

01:25:54.336 --> 01:25:57.172
<I>Cross deflected.
Effenberg. Out for a corner.</I>

01:25:57.173 --> 01:25:59.007
<I>Can Manchester United score?</I>

01:25:59.008 --> 01:26:00.675
<I>They always score.</I>

01:26:00.676 --> 01:26:02.427
And I remember sprinting
over to the corner,

01:26:02.428 --> 01:26:05.013
and I had a good feeling
because I knew that

01:26:05.014 --> 01:26:07.849
I'd been kind of playing
pretty well in the game.

01:26:09.477 --> 01:26:13.104
<I>And I remember putting the ball down,
and it's really tight in the corners.</I>

01:26:13.105 --> 01:26:14.689
<I>I could hear the United fans.</I>

01:26:15.858 --> 01:26:18.359
But I was just concentrating more

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.697
on watching Peter Schmeichel
run up from his goal,

01:26:22.698 --> 01:26:27.202
and knowing that, as a kid,
if I put a bad cross in

01:26:27.203 --> 01:26:30.580
while we're warming the goalkeepers up,

01:26:30.581 --> 01:26:32.791
Pete would absolutely kill us.

01:26:32.792 --> 01:26:35.627
I think those moments,
when I was a youth-team player,

01:26:35.628 --> 01:26:38.797
prepared me for moments like this.

01:26:39.465 --> 01:26:41.883
<I>COMMENTATOR: Schmeichel is forward.
Can he score another in Europe?</I>

01:26:41.884 --> 01:26:44.010
<I>- He's got one in Europe already.
- COMMENTATOR 2: Beckham.</I>

01:26:44.011 --> 01:26:47.472
<I>In towards Schmeichel.
It's come for Dwight Yorke.</I>

01:26:47.473 --> 01:26:48.890
<I>Cleared. Giggs with a shot!</I>

01:26:48.891 --> 01:26:50.099
<I>Sheringham!</I>

01:26:53.687 --> 01:26:56.648
<I>BECKHAM: So then we were back in the game.
Everyone was celebrating.</I>

01:26:56.649 --> 01:27:00.193
<I>Everyone was like, you know,
we've got it to extra time.</I>

01:27:00.194 --> 01:27:05.240
I looked at the players that I'd grown
up with on the pitch at that time,

01:27:05.241 --> 01:27:10.078
and I knew that they knew
that it wasn't over.

01:27:13.582 --> 01:27:16.793
I'm thinking, shit, we've got extra time
now, I better get my legs going again.

01:27:16.794 --> 01:27:19.754
So I've sprinted right back,
for, like, about 50 yards,

01:27:19.755 --> 01:27:21.172
trying to get some blood
going through my legs.

01:27:21.173 --> 01:27:24.926
As soon as we equalised,

01:27:26.387 --> 01:27:27.887
my mindset just switched.

01:27:27.888 --> 01:27:29.806
<I>"Get this to extra time,
we're going to beat them."</I>

01:27:29.807 --> 01:27:31.266
<I>That was my mindset straight</I> away.

01:27:31.267 --> 01:27:32.600
"We're going to beat them in extra time."

01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:37.605
And the next minute and a half,
I couldn't even tell you what happened.

01:27:37.606 --> 01:27:39.732
<I>That's an out-of-body experience, that.</I>

01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:43.945
<I>BECKHAM: We won the ball back again.
We broke forward.</I>

01:27:43.946 --> 01:27:45.446
<I>We got another corner.</I>

01:27:45.948 --> 01:27:48.449
I'm getting goosebumps just...
I can feel it.

01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:52.537
I remember the feeling
of getting that ball in the corner,

01:27:53.455 --> 01:27:56.291
knowing that I'm going
to put a good corner in again.

01:28:01.005 --> 01:28:04.173
And then everything just literally erupted.

01:28:05.092 --> 01:28:07.969
<I>COMMENTATOR 2: In to Sheringham...
And Solskjaer has got it!</I>

01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:11.014
(CHEERING WILDLY)

01:28:16.645 --> 01:28:19.230
This was what was meant to happen.

01:28:19.815 --> 01:28:23.359
PHIL: <I>There's no greater feeling than scoring
in the last minute to win</I> a <I>game.</I>

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.486
You know, I've had kids.

01:28:25.487 --> 01:28:26.905
I've had kids and I've got married,

01:28:26.906 --> 01:28:29.324
but it's the greatest feeling
in the whole wide world.

01:28:29.325 --> 01:28:31.618
BUTT: <I>I don't remember the final whistle,
to be honest with you.</I>

01:28:31.619 --> 01:28:32.952
It was like the game was over then.

01:28:35.831 --> 01:28:36.915
<I>COMMENTATOR 2: History is made.</I>

01:28:36.916 --> 01:28:38.666
GIGGS: As soon as the final whistle went,

01:28:38.667 --> 01:28:42.921
it was relief, it was excitement,
it was joy, it was everything.

01:28:42.922 --> 01:28:46.174
And I just went to my knees
and just started sobbing.

01:28:46.842 --> 01:28:49.344
GARY: I just remember lying on the floor,
looking up, thinking,

01:28:49.345 --> 01:28:52.263
almost nearly crying on the pitch,
thinking, "Oh, my God.

01:28:52.264 --> 01:28:54.182
"What has just happened here?"

01:28:54.183 --> 01:28:56.809
I went up to Gary, the lights were on,
nobody was in.

01:28:56.810 --> 01:29:00.396
His eyes were glazed.
His eyeballs were rolling.

01:29:00.397 --> 01:29:04.651
I looked up and the first person
coming towards me was the gaffer.

01:29:05.194 --> 01:29:07.445
<I>And just got up and just hugged him.</I>

01:29:07.446 --> 01:29:10.907
<I>GARY: But that night you felt you were hugging
and you just never wanted to let go.</I>

01:29:10.908 --> 01:29:14.369
The best feeling I've ever had
on a football pitch. The best...

01:29:15.454 --> 01:29:16.788
Best I've ever felt.

01:29:16.789 --> 01:29:19.540
It's the greatest day of my life,

01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:21.751
and it's hard for me to comprehend it.

01:29:22.378 --> 01:29:25.171
<I>COMMENTATOR: Gary Neville, 24.
Phil Neville, 22.</I>

01:29:25.172 --> 01:29:30.426
<I>David Beckham, 24.
Nicky Butt, 24. Giggs, 25.</I>

01:29:30.427 --> 01:29:36.599
<I>Whatever they achieve in their futures,
I doubt that they will ever, ever cap this.</I>

01:29:38.102 --> 01:29:42.480
<I>Manchester United
are Champions of Europe again.</I>

01:29:42.481 --> 01:29:46.150
I remember feeling Scholesy
should have been out there with us.

01:29:46.151 --> 01:29:50.822
The image that I like most is when we all
make a tunnel for Scholesy and Keaney

01:29:50.823 --> 01:29:52.782
and they come through
and carry the European Cup,

01:29:52.783 --> 01:29:57.120
because they were absolutely critical
to everything that we achieved that season.

01:29:57.121 --> 01:29:59.872
SCHOLES: I'd rather have just gone
in the dressing room

01:29:59.873 --> 01:30:03.418
and waited for everyone, really,
and congratulated people that way,

01:30:03.419 --> 01:30:08.923
but, you know, I suppose the players
made a big deal out of it,

01:30:08.924 --> 01:30:12.885
and me and Roy embarrassingly
were on the pitch.

01:30:23.355 --> 01:30:24.689
I'll never ever forget that.

01:30:24.690 --> 01:30:27.650
After all them years of waiting
and then to see it,

01:30:27.651 --> 01:30:32.780
your team win the Champions League
in your lifetime, in such amazing fashion.

01:30:32.781 --> 01:30:36.034
In fact, I missed the winning goal,
I was crying like a baby.

01:30:36.035 --> 01:30:37.952
Once that first goal went in.

01:30:38.787 --> 01:30:41.914
I missed the winning goal.
I was just slumped on my seat.

01:30:42.458 --> 01:30:44.959
I was just out of it emotionally,
gone, you know?

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.128
I've always been...

01:30:48.464 --> 01:30:50.965
Never got carried away,
never ever got carried away.

01:30:50.966 --> 01:30:53.468
I nearly got carried away that night,
you know, but...

01:30:53.469 --> 01:30:56.137
So excited, but it made me immensely proud.

01:30:59.892 --> 01:31:04.937
<I>BOYLE: The romance of the last-minute
never-say-die moment, of them winning</I>

01:31:04.938 --> 01:31:06.939
<I>I suppose was very special.</I>

01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.318
That continuity between

01:31:11.612 --> 01:31:14.238
the Busby Babes being lost as a team,

01:31:14.239 --> 01:31:20.495
you know, that potential, that wonder,
that was so tragically interrupted,

01:31:20.496 --> 01:31:23.331
<I>and then being renewed
by that manager again,</I>

01:31:23.332 --> 01:31:27.085
<I>ten years later to win the European Cup,
and then 30 years later,</I>

01:31:27.086 --> 01:31:30.505
<I>to have to wait 30 years
just to see them do it again, was...</I>

01:31:31.006 --> 01:31:33.216
Yeah, it was very, very
special, I think, really.

01:31:35.886 --> 01:31:37.804
GARY: You were massively aware that night

01:31:37.805 --> 01:31:40.598
of what you were representing
in the history of the club,

01:31:40.599 --> 01:31:45.186
because that's where the club,
and all its tradition,

01:31:46.271 --> 01:31:50.525
all its history that it's got, comes back
and just comes all into one moment.

01:31:50.526 --> 01:31:52.568
And that night seemed to be
just one of those moments.

01:31:57.074 --> 01:31:59.826
I think winning the European Cup
is massive for anybody,

01:31:59.827 --> 01:32:04.372
but when you've won it with lads
that you've grew up with all your life,

01:32:04.373 --> 01:32:07.333
and we've got good pictures now
of the six of us

01:32:07.334 --> 01:32:11.337
with the European Cup, and it's, like,
some of us knew each other from 12.

01:32:13.173 --> 01:32:16.342
I never look back. I don't like to look
back, I always like to look forward.

01:32:16.343 --> 01:32:18.219
But if you said to me,
"Could you live 10 days again?",

01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.846
it would be those 10 days.

01:32:19.847 --> 01:32:21.514
It's unbelievable.

01:32:24.476 --> 01:32:26.769
It's perfect script.

01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:28.312
(CHUCKLES)

01:32:28.897 --> 01:32:30.106
Yeah.

01:32:30.107 --> 01:32:31.524
It's romantic.

01:32:31.525 --> 01:32:35.631
Only sports can give you
this kind of emotion.

01:32:35.632 --> 01:32:41.345
But the one thing, when you look back,
in 100 years, the treble of '99 will be...

01:32:42.139 --> 01:32:44.015
That will never be forgotten, that.

01:32:44.016 --> 01:32:50.313
I think there are special moments in time
when a whole series of things come together,

01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:55.484
when you had those young people from,
you know, very ordinary backgrounds,

01:32:55.485 --> 01:32:58.529
who suddenly symbolised,
represented something new

01:32:58.530 --> 01:33:02.742
and had that extraordinary
ability to achieve.

01:33:03.243 --> 01:33:06.245
And to achieve in a way

01:33:07.247 --> 01:33:08.581
that people hadn't done before.

01:33:08.582 --> 01:33:12.877
You always hope and think
that things will happen again.

01:33:12.878 --> 01:33:16.297
But will there ever be
a time where six lads

01:33:16.298 --> 01:33:21.385
who grew up from the age of 12, 13,
come through and win a treble,

01:33:21.386 --> 01:33:24.639
having supported the club? I'm not sure.

01:33:25.265 --> 01:33:26.974
<I>I'm not sure it can happen again.</I>

01:33:26.975 --> 01:33:29.518
<I>I'm not sure football,
the way in which it's going to go,</I>

01:33:29.519 --> 01:33:31.896
<I>I'm not sure football, in the way,
in the immediacy of life now,</I>

01:33:31.897 --> 01:33:33.522
<I>where everything's got to be instant,</I>

01:33:33.523 --> 01:33:39.820
I don't think you'll ever see six, seven players
coming through in British football again.

01:33:39.821 --> 01:33:44.408
Well, you probably dream about playing
for Man United, don't you, but...

01:33:44.409 --> 01:33:48.204
The reality for most people,
it's not going to happen.

01:33:48.205 --> 01:33:51.832
And we were just the lucky ones
that it did happen to.

01:33:51.833 --> 01:33:55.503
We managed to all play with each other
right through the youth team,

01:33:55.504 --> 01:33:59.840
straight through to the first team. It
doesn't really happen at that many places,

01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:03.886
and will anything like that happen again?
I'm not too sure.

01:34:06.723 --> 01:34:12.853
Until recently, where I sat back and looked
at old videos, looked at old pictures,

01:34:12.854 --> 01:34:16.440
and really kind of thought
about what it was like

01:34:16.441 --> 01:34:20.653
with these players that I'd grown up with,
to win what we'd won,

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:24.532
<I>to turn round and see,
you know, Gary behind me...</I>

01:34:24.533 --> 01:34:27.201
<I>We'd grown up in those positions.</I>

01:34:27.202 --> 01:34:31.038
<I>You know, to look to the side
and see Scholesy and Butty and Giggsy.</I>

01:34:31.039 --> 01:34:35.876
<I>You know, to look back to see Phil.
You know, this was...</I>

01:34:37.546 --> 01:34:41.215
<I>This was more special
than anything I've been involved in</I>

01:34:41.216 --> 01:34:44.016
<I>through my whole life and my whole career.</I>
