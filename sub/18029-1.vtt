- All right, cut it!
- All right, hold it!

03:29.400 --> 03:31.994
What is that idiot doin'?

03:37.120 --> 03:39.395
- What's that idiot doing?
- I just asked that.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.789
- What's the answer?
- I don't know.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.678
You're the director.
You brought him over from India.

03:44.760 --> 03:49.550
You'd better start telling him what to do
or we'll be out of business. Now go ahead.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.395
Come on.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.471
- Charlie...
- Yes?

04:14.440 --> 04:16.077
Ready? Action!

04:37.960 --> 04:39.837
Cut, dammit! Cut!

04:48.040 --> 04:50.031
- Mr Bakshi.
- Yes, sir?

04:50.840 --> 04:55.118
Has it occurred to you that
the period of our picture is 1878?

04:55.200 --> 04:59.273
Oh, yes indeed, sir. I am well aware that
that is the period of the film. 1878.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.875
Mr Bakshi, are you
also aware that in 1878

05:02.960 --> 05:05.394
...they weren't wearing
underwater watches?

05:05.480 --> 05:08.711
Yes, sir. I know that.
They had not even been invented.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.995
- Got the time?
- Yes, it's...

05:11.480 --> 05:14.517
- Oh, my God.
- All right. Lunch, everybody.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.832
<i>That's 42 for the crew.
One hour for the cast.</i>

05:25.880 --> 05:29.873
OK, guys. The cue for the demolition
is when I lower my hand like this.

05:29.960 --> 05:34.954
- We got one shot at this. Let's get it right.
- All right. Places, everybody!

05:35.040 --> 05:40.160
Marty! Clutterbuck says if we don't wrap
this location today, it's your neck.

05:40.240 --> 05:44.791
- All we have left is to blow up the fort.
- OK, OK. Great. Great.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.718
OK, Ken, let's go.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.031
- Carl? Earl?
- All right. Stand by.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.351
You.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.551
Yes, you.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.110
You get off of my set
and get out of my picture.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.078
Off. Out! You're through!
You're washed up! You're finished!

06:36.160 --> 06:39.675
I'll see to it you never
make another movie again!

06:40.680 --> 06:45.754
- Does that include television, sir?
- I'll kill him. I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

06:59.640 --> 07:02.632
<i>- Yeah?
- Mr Divot calling from location, on six.</i>

07:02.720 --> 07:04.711
All right.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.151
Yeah, Charlie?

07:09.640 --> 07:11.153
What?

07:11.440 --> 07:13.237
What?

07:13.320 --> 07:15.311
The whole damn thing?

07:15.400 --> 07:18.119
How the hell could
a thing like that happen?

07:18.200 --> 07:20.236
What's his name?

07:20.320 --> 07:22.311
Spell it.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.515
Hrundi... V...

07:27.160 --> 07:30.835
B-a-k-s-h-i.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.992
I'll see to it he never
works again in this town.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.117
- Your wife wants the party guest list.
- On the desk.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.191
You know where to reach me.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.877
I need an address for Hrundi V Bakshi.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.954
B-a-k-s-h-i.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.479
<i>(# pianist plays "Nothing to Lose")</i>

14:30.080 --> 14:31.957
Vodka and Scotch, sir?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.391
No. I...

14:43.160 --> 14:45.151
I never touch it. Thank you.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.551
No, thank you.

15:08.760 --> 15:13.231
- Hors d'oeuvre, sir?
- Well, I'm on a diet, but to hell with it.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.838
...the mother says to the father
"We got the wrong baby. "

15:55.920 --> 15:58.832
And the father says
"Shh! It's a better buggy. "

15:59.400 --> 16:01.709
I never heard that. It's marvellous!

16:05.440 --> 16:09.035
Oh, ho, ho! Oh, yes!

16:10.400 --> 16:14.552
I missed the middle part, but I can tell
from the way that you are enjoying it...

16:14.640 --> 16:17.029
...it must have been
a very humorous anecdote.

16:17.120 --> 16:20.715
Because the way you are laughing
just shows how much you enjoyed it.

16:20.800 --> 16:24.270
I love a good laugh. Don't you?
Makes the world go round.

16:24.360 --> 16:28.433
It's good to have a laugh.
Wonderful, wonderful.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.311
Very good.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.351
I must remember that one.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.917
...bound and gagged for six hours.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.754
They took everything.
Even the gold watch my daddy left me.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.272
They took the gold watch
that your father left you?

17:02.960 --> 17:05.113
I'm sorry.
It's absolutely fantastic.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.752
What a wonderful thing to do. Take
everything including your father's watch.

17:10.839 --> 17:15.516
I tell you, tonight is one big round
of laughter. All fun and laughter.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.869
The congressman was just telling us
about the time he was robbed.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.317
- Who's the foreigner?
- I don't know.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.676
Someone my mixed-up wife invited.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.629
Hello, dog. What do you want, eh?
You like my feet, do you?

17:44.720 --> 17:47.109
Have your fill and away you go.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.398
Feet are considered a delicacy
among certain animals, you know.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.597
<i>Go on. You've had enough now.
Off. Ciao, dog.</i>

17:55.240 --> 18:00.951
In fact, there are man-eating animals who
will eat only the feet, not one other thing.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.671
<i>Get away. Ciao, now. Ciao, dog.</i>

18:05.000 --> 18:07.992
Get away. Get away from me, dog.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.197
- Vodka or Scotch, sir?
- No, I... No, thank you.

18:26.120 --> 18:29.192
- Good evening, Mr Divot. How are you?
- Uh, how are you?

18:29.280 --> 18:31.271
Smile at 'em.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.831
Good evening, General.
I'd like you to meet Miss Michele Monet.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.469
Mr Clutterbuck. Mrs Clutterbuck.
How are ya, Alice?

18:42.560 --> 18:45.279
I'll introduce my guests, if I may.
Mrs Dunphy...

18:50.400 --> 18:53.517
I've heard some wonderful
things about you.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.433
Well, sir, you seem to have
a wonderful party going.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.235
- How do you like it so far?
- Fine.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.470
Have a drink. Go ahead.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.158
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.752
- Hello. Good evening.
- Good evening.

19:28.840 --> 19:32.355
What a beautiful evening it is, to be sure.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.555
What's in there?

19:41.640 --> 19:43.631
What, in here?

19:45.480 --> 19:47.471
Well, there is nothing in there.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.791
Yes, there is.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.518
Oh, I don't know. I don't think so.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.797
- No.
- Can't you see it?

19:58.880 --> 20:01.838
No, no, no. There is
definitely nothing in there.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.595
If there was something,
it's gone away now anyway.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.671
Well, I can see it.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.560
What is it?

20:13.640 --> 20:16.234
I don't know, but I don't like it.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.231
<i>Hare ram ram.</i>

20:28.320 --> 20:29.469
Hey.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.677
- Oh. Pardon me, sir.
- That's quite all right, feller.

20:32.760 --> 20:37.470
- I'm so sorry, sir. I beg your pardon.
- Honey, we'll play it over here.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.997
Right here. This is an easy shot.

20:40.080 --> 20:43.516
First get in the saddle,
just like I taught you. That's it.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.672
- No, I feel silly.
- Oh, no, hon. You can do it this way.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.070
I was doin' it the other day.
Just relax and you can...

20:50.880 --> 20:52.791
Just relax. Just...

20:52.880 --> 20:55.553
Pay no attention to me, sir.
I'm merely spectating.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.676
Fine. Fine.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.513
I can see that you are
an experienced player.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.955
One of the best, feller. One of the best.

21:03.040 --> 21:08.433
Sir, what is the name of a game that has
a multitude of coloured balls like that?

21:08.520 --> 21:11.114
- Pool.
- Poo?

21:11.200 --> 21:16.115
- No, not poo. Pool.
- Pool! Oh, like swimming pool.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.078
- I never heard of a game called pool.
- Fine game.

21:19.160 --> 21:23.551
And what is the object of it? To disperse
these balls strategically around the table?

21:23.640 --> 21:26.234
Get the balls in the holes,
except the white one.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.232
That is the art? The art is
not to have the white one in?

21:29.320 --> 21:31.072
- Right.
- Good.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.310
And how many people can play?

21:33.400 --> 21:36.915
- Oh, whole bunches, or twos and threes.
- Groups of people can play?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.992
- By yourself.
- Thank goodness. How wonderful.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.793
Keep your eye on
the white ball, and you can...

21:48.360 --> 21:50.351
Oh...

21:52.040 --> 21:54.031
Oh, excuse me, sir.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.789
Excuse me, sir, but...

21:56.880 --> 22:01.795
...you are, are you not, "Wyoming Bill"
Kelso, the famous film star?

22:01.880 --> 22:05.395
- That's me, in the flesh.
- Oh, God. What a moment in my life!

22:05.480 --> 22:07.471
I've seen every one of your films.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.518
Oh, that's wonderful! Wonderful!

22:10.600 --> 22:13.592
- What a wonderful strong grip you've got!
- Yes, I do.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.878
I would have been disappointed
if you hadn't crushed my hand.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.068
Would you do me the honour
to sign me an autograph?

22:21.160 --> 22:23.799
Oh, sure. Here, hold this. I'll be glad to.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.269
- I'm also in the acting profession.
- You are?

22:26.360 --> 22:30.319
<i>Yes, indeed. I'm not in your quality,
but I am also an actor.</i>

22:30.400 --> 22:33.631
- What's your name?
- Hrundi. H-r-u-n-d-i.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.712
Wait till I tell them
at home that I've met him.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.439
- Where are you from?
- I am from India.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.750
- Got you covered, Injun.
- Oh!

22:42.760 --> 22:45.991
- Bang! Howdy, partner!
- Pretty quick on the draw there.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.514
Never I believed in my whole life
I would meet him...

22:48.600 --> 22:50.909
...and he would go "Bang, partner. "

22:51.280 --> 22:55.831
Listen to me: White man
speak with forked tongue.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.110
You old horned toad, buddy.

23:02.600 --> 23:06.593
- Cute little feller, ain't he?
- I know all your sayings. All of them.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.955
The one where you walk along and go...

23:11.080 --> 23:14.152
- Hrundi, say hello to the signorina here.
- Hello, partener.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.708
- Piacere.
- Bakshi.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.791
- There you go.
- Ah, thank you.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.599
- This is a wonderful thing for me.
- My pleasure.

23:21.680 --> 23:27.835
Thank you, and I would love to say that it
has been the greatest moment in my life.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.031
Bang! I got you!

23:30.120 --> 23:34.352
- I was quick on the draw.
- You beat me that time, pal. That's right.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.916
- Lots of luck to you.
- Yes, and the same to you, sir.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.711
Howdy, partener!

25:32.560 --> 25:34.679
Oh, that was a short dance.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.638
- That's right.
- They don't go on for long, do they?

25:37.720 --> 25:39.517
We just started and...

25:39.600 --> 25:43.309
Well, anyway, thank you very much.
Perhaps we can dance again later.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.073
<i>- Oh, OK.
- If your carnet de bal is not full up.</i>

26:03.200 --> 26:05.191
Hello, Polly.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.597
Hello, Polly. Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.111
Hello.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.914
Would you like some food, Polly?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.797
Pretty Polly.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.155
- Birdie num num.
- Hello.

26:27.240 --> 26:31.028
Birdie num num. Birdie num num.
Have birdie num num.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.351
Go on.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.438
I'll give you a last one.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.798
She's... Having... The birdie num nums.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.872
Look. She's waiting for more num num.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.951
All gone. Num num is gone.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.753
Pretty bird. Pretty Polly.

28:02.840 --> 28:03.829
Num num.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.798
<i>Num num. Birdie num num.</i>

28:11.960 --> 28:14.235
- What in the world is that?
- I can't imagine.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.559
Howdy, partener. Howdy, partener.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.914
Howdy, par... Te... Ner... Partener!

28:30.000 --> 28:31.991
Howdy, partener.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.520
Look at that! Oh!

29:02.240 --> 29:04.549
What was that?

29:08.880 --> 29:10.757
Would you mind getting...

29:23.080 --> 29:26.595
This is 469-6151.

29:27.720 --> 29:31.508
Please remain connected
to the telephone.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.831
There is a call for you, sir.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.909
Please, hold on to the connection.
Please, one second.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.391
I wonder if you could...

29:43.320 --> 29:45.834
- Can you... Hold here?
- Yes.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.397
Would you just let my hand go?
You've got my hand. Thank you.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.074
Now I'll take this from you.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.276
Hold on one moment.

29:57.080 --> 30:01.596
Excuse the mess up here. It is birdie
num nums. I've got them under my feet.

30:07.440 --> 30:10.557
Just one second. If you can
take this around you...

30:15.120 --> 30:17.509
Just lift the ashtray, please.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.955
Yes. Thank you.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.593
Yes, yes.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.477
Oh, Benny.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.552
Yeah, well, I'm having a few people in.

30:33.240 --> 30:38.155
The picture, yeah. It was going fine
until some idiot blew up the set.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.791
- Scotch?
- No, no.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.950
This picture's a very good one,
you know. It's gonna be great.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.837
- Caviar?
- No, thank you.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.673
- Sir?
- I don't think so, thanks.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.432
Eat!

31:48.520 --> 31:52.433
Oh, sure, honey. We're gonna eat.
But they gotta ring the little bell first.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.511
Bell?

31:54.640 --> 31:58.315
- Bell. Ding-ding.
- Ding-ding?

31:58.400 --> 32:01.198
But first let's have
a little tiddly at the bar.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.510
- Hello.
- Oh, howdy, little buddy!

32:07.080 --> 32:10.231
That's my old cowboy crusher. Injun grip.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.357
Oh, you really crushed
my old Indian hand!

32:13.440 --> 32:15.715
It sort of smarts, don't it?

32:15.800 --> 32:18.234
Friendliest little critter I ever met.

32:19.120 --> 32:23.716
It's an honour to have had my hand
crushed by "Wyoming Bill" Kelso.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.234
Wait till I tell them back home.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.591
Ooh.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.751
Pooh!

32:59.040 --> 33:00.519
- Oh.
- OK.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.591
- Pardon me.
- It's OK.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.591
- Hello.
- Hello.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.913
Oh, um... it was occupied.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.230
- Oh.
- Yes.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.311
Hrundi V Bakshi.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.836
- Pardon?
- That is what my name is called.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.036
- Oh. Michele Monet.
- How do you do?

33:32.120 --> 33:34.111
How do you do?

33:34.200 --> 33:36.350
Are you... Having a good time?

33:36.440 --> 33:38.431
- Mm-hm.
- Good, good.

33:38.520 --> 33:42.559
- Are you having a good time?
- Oh, yes. I am having a good time.

33:42.640 --> 33:47.475
- Good.
- It's... Good to be having a good time.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.551
- Yes.
- Yes.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.077
- Are you an actress?
- Yes.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.720
- Oh, yes. I can tell.
- Oh?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.791
- Because I am an actor.
- Oh, I see.

33:56.880 --> 34:00.555
Actors can tell when actresses are
actresses, and actresses can tell...

34:00.640 --> 34:03.916
- It is a thing that we have together.
- Ah.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.116
- You are also French.
- How do you know?

34:06.200 --> 34:08.315
Your name, and the way
you speak English.

34:08.400 --> 34:13.235
- Oh, that's right. Do you speak French?
- Just enough to get myself into trouble.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.311
I'll tell you what I can say.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.391
<i>Où est la direction
de la tour Eiffel, s'il vous plaît?</i>

34:18.480 --> 34:20.710
That's pretty good. You do speak French.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.552
- Do you speak Hindustani?
- No.

34:22.639 --> 34:26.428
Well, you are not missing anything.
Oh, dear.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.636
I am here at the moment taking part...

34:28.719 --> 34:32.349
...in Mr General Clutterbuck's
latest motion-picture extravaganza.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.034
- Oh. That's wonderful.
- It is a main feature role...

34:35.120 --> 34:37.714
...and I am very glad to have
the opportunity to do it.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.791
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.440
Are you... Doing something in a movie?

34:42.520 --> 34:45.034
- Are you working in a movie?
- No. No.

34:45.120 --> 34:48.556
But next week I'm doing
a test for Mr Divot.

34:48.639 --> 34:51.154
Oh, Mr Divot!

34:51.239 --> 34:53.629
- What?
- Oh, listen. I...

34:54.840 --> 34:56.319
- Oh!
- Let's get to the bar.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.279
- Mr Divot, how do you do?
- Yeah. Yeah, right, fella. All right?

35:00.720 --> 35:04.030
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.233
- Who is that guy?
- A very nice man...

35:07.320 --> 35:10.710
- with an unpronounceable name.
- I know him from someplace.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.598
How are you, General?
Remember Miss Michele Monet here?

35:13.680 --> 35:17.719
Have you heard her sing? We're giving
her a test. She sings like a nightingale.

35:17.800 --> 35:21.839
- I'll look forward to that.
- Excuse us, sir. We're going to the bar.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.671
- Dinner is served.
- Good.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.669
Dinner is served.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.433
Dinner is served, darling.

36:10.520 --> 36:14.513
- Alice, where is Miss Monet sitting?
- Right around here, dear.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.110
Bernie, give Miss Monet a hand, please.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.839
Excuse me for a minute, sweetheart.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.558
Dear... I believe you're down here, dear.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.471
Right down here.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.592
- Bakshi, right?
- Oh, yes. Mr Bakshi.

36:50.680 --> 36:55.037
- Oh, there's no chair.
- Everybody needs to move over.

36:55.120 --> 36:59.716
Oh. Darling, would you mind moving up
just one? I'm terribly sorry.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.913
I'm sorry, darling. You're going to
have to move back. It was a mistake.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.994
I'm awfully sorry. Levinson, will you
get the gentleman a chair, please?

37:42.080 --> 37:46.790
No, it was a mistake. But he's going to
bring you a chair and you'll be all right.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.870
What happened to your little face?

37:58.960 --> 38:02.839
Nothing, except that it is
somewhat nearer to the table now.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.354
My chair is lower than your chair.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.876
- Do you like your strawberry soup?
- Oh, strawberry soup.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.315
I haven't had it lately.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.073
- Lovely in summer, don't you think?
- Yes.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.556
Oh, yes, it's... Oh! It's lovely right now.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.631
Good. I'm so glad.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.829
Hey, gimme some of that, will ya, pal?

39:22.560 --> 39:25.552
How's the chow? Looks pretty good.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.911
No wine, thank you.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.471
No wine, please. No, no.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.197
Please, no wine.

39:55.280 --> 39:58.556
I know you would like me
to have it, but I don't want it.

39:58.920 --> 40:02.913
All right. I don't drink.
I don't smoke. No wine.

40:25.960 --> 40:29.669
Are you all right? Oh, I'm so sorry.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.876
I dropped my roll.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.708
If I can sit here,
I won't be in anybody's way.

40:35.800 --> 40:40.510
- You're sure you're comfortable?
- Here the door won't bang me.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.989
All right. Excuse me.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.718
They should be finished
with the soup. Get the plates.

41:37.200 --> 41:40.317
- Mrs Clutterbuck, shall I serve the salad?
- Yes.

41:58.880 --> 42:01.269
What are you doing? What are you doing?

42:37.680 --> 42:39.671
Get into the kitchen.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.556
That is just outside Bombay.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.950
- And Bombay is in India.
- Oh, that is very much in India.

42:48.040 --> 42:51.032
And that is indeed the gateway to India...

42:57.880 --> 43:01.589
I think that one of these bearers
does not like the other one.

43:02.360 --> 43:06.114
You have a very hard time
finding good help these days.

43:06.200 --> 43:08.191
Yes, you certainly do.

45:23.040 --> 45:28.034
Did you hear about the trapeze artist who
got divorced? Caught his wife in the act.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.151
That's terribly funny.

45:34.240 --> 45:36.993
Yeah, it's been terribly funny
for about 20 years.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.359
Oh!

47:50.280 --> 47:54.671
- Gore, are you sure it's all right?
- It's not "all right". It's divine.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.791
You've got to start with education.
That's where you need to spend...

48:14.120 --> 48:17.396
Mrs Clutterbuck, please
can I take this opportunity...

48:17.480 --> 48:20.552
...to apologise to you formally
for what happened at the table?

48:20.640 --> 48:23.632
Oh, my dear, just forget it.
It wasn't your fault.

48:23.720 --> 48:25.711
- What embarrassment for you.
- Why, no.

48:25.800 --> 48:28.792
It was that ridiculous
little chair they put you on.

48:28.880 --> 48:32.839
It was awful, but at the same time I feel
it is my duty to say this to you now.

48:32.920 --> 48:36.435
- I just think we should forget all about it.
- Indeed, you are right.

48:36.520 --> 48:40.433
But before then I will also go to your
husband and say to him that I am sorry.

48:40.520 --> 48:43.830
- That's not necessary, really.
- It is on my conscience.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.593
- Well, if you want to, go ahead.
- Thank you.

49:06.080 --> 49:09.675
- General, excellent aroma.
- I'm glad you like it.

49:09.760 --> 49:12.832
Still have a few left over
from the pre-Castro days.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.475
General Clutterbuck, sir.

49:16.560 --> 49:20.792
Please, I would like to formally apologise
to you for any inconvenience...

49:20.880 --> 49:24.395
...that I may have caused you
or your guests at the table tonight.

49:24.480 --> 49:27.950
- It's understandable.
- It will never happen again...

49:28.040 --> 49:32.272
...should you wish to have me on your list
of guests on some other occasion.

49:32.360 --> 49:36.273
When I saw what havoc that I wrought,
my poor old knees turned to water.

49:36.360 --> 49:38.351
- God, what a state I was.
- I can imagine.

49:38.440 --> 49:42.797
But now that I have apologised to you...
Also, I have spoken to your good lady...

49:42.880 --> 49:46.509
...and I told her, sir, that it is
a terrible thing to have happened...

49:46.600 --> 49:48.830
...and I am sorry deep down inside of me.

49:48.920 --> 49:50.956
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thank you, sir.

49:51.040 --> 49:54.032
- Thank you for listening to me.
- It's all right.

49:54.120 --> 49:58.511
General, about this Wac.
I asked her to go out with me one night...

50:30.720 --> 50:33.951
Brandy or...
crème de cacao, sir?

50:34.040 --> 50:35.758
Yes.

50:55.480 --> 50:58.517
Clutterbuck's a big man.
He could make a star out of me.

50:58.600 --> 51:00.750
Put the drink down and listen to me.

52:15.520 --> 52:18.592
- Oh. I beg your pardon.
- That's all right.

52:30.520 --> 52:33.080
- It is occupied.
- Oh.

52:38.400 --> 52:40.960
Do you speak Hindustani?

52:41.040 --> 52:43.031
No.

52:52.240 --> 52:54.231
Oh, excuse me, please.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.951
Hey, close the door, man!

54:34.720 --> 54:38.952
- Look, I told the General you'd sing.
- Well, I'd rather not do it tonight.

54:39.040 --> 54:41.349
Why not?

54:41.440 --> 54:44.989
- The orchestra is gone.
- There's a guitar. You play the guitar?

54:45.080 --> 54:47.799
- Yes.
- Then you play the guitar and you sing.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.950
Hey, waiter, come over here.

54:50.040 --> 54:54.272
You're gonna be a smash.
Don't worry about a thing.

54:54.360 --> 54:56.635
See that guitar? Go get it.

54:56.720 --> 54:58.711
Get the guitar.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.758
<i># Nothing to lose...</i>

55:49.840 --> 55:53.992
<i># If we are wise...</i>

55:54.080 --> 55:59.996

<i># We'll only hurt ourselves...</i>

56:38.160 --> 56:43.678
<i># If we build dreams that don't come true...</i>

56:45.600 --> 56:48.273
<i># What can we lose?</i>

56:48.360 --> 56:52.399
<i># We know the score...</i>

56:52.480 --> 56:55.597
<i># Let's wait before we talk...</i>

58:10.520 --> 58:13.318
<i># Nothing to lose...</i>

58:31.080 --> 58:33.799
- Well, how do you like her, General?
- Great.

58:33.880 --> 58:37.270
- How about you, Bernie? She's great!
- I think she's really great.

58:57.040 --> 59:01.272
All right, you win, partener. You win.

59:02.120 --> 59:07.956
I'm tellin' you, he thought
you were terrific. He was very impressed.

59:08.040 --> 59:12.830
So tomorrow's test will be just a formality.
We wanna see what you look like on film.

59:12.920 --> 59:16.310
Trust me. Here, we can talk.
It's a little quieter in here.

59:16.400 --> 59:19.915
- Oh, Charlie, this is the bedroom.
- Ah, it is the bedroom!

59:20.000 --> 59:22.434
- Come on, baby.
- Why don't we go back downstairs?

59:22.520 --> 59:26.513
Too much noise. Let's sit on the bed.

59:26.600 --> 59:29.319
Let's sit down. That's it.
That's a good girl.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.272
- Charlie! Please, don't do that.
- Just one little kiss.

59:35.360 --> 59:37.351
Charlie!

59:39.680 --> 59:41.910
- Gimme my gun!
- Thank you, partner.

59:42.960 --> 59:46.157
- Where are you goin'?
- Attention!

59:48.160 --> 59:50.151
Just forget it. Just forget it.

59:51.720 --> 59:53.711
Charlie...

59:56.440 --> 59:59.000
Knock it off and hit the sack!

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.591
Cookie!

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.072
Who's in the head?

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.391
Help!

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.871
Please! Come and help.
There's someone in the pool.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.030
- What can I do for you?
- Hurry up.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:42.157
- Oh, hey, little buddy!
- American aid, partener!

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.437
Great night for a dip!
That feller has a heap of jollies...

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.829
- He's drowning!
- He's drownin'?

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.195
Hrundi, are you drownin'?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.477
Great leapin' pollywogs!
That little gal's got spunk!

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.473
Get him, gal! Grab him by the wigwam!
I'll wait right here for ya!

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.358
Come on, honey. Bring him over here.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.431
Get ahold of him.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:26.276
Bartender, we been fishin'.
Caught ourselves a little Injun.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.954
- Oh, no, I don't drink.
- Come on.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.749
- It'll do you good, partner.
- Right down the old hatch.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:37.516
There you go. That'll straighten you
right out. You'll feel better.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.116
- Just a little bit more.
- There you go. How about a little more?

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.192
- No, I'm perfectly all right.
- Good.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.829
Looks like little buddy went bye-bye.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.315
Poor darling. You stay there and...

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.712
Well, I don't know what we can do, but
perhaps we can at least dry it out for you.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.791
Oh, dear. Honestly!

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.192
Come in! Your tie looks like a
salamander's tongue that got stepped on.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.077
- Hiya, honey.
- Is he all right?

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.594
He's just a little wet.
You got some dry duds?

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:17.071
Surely. I'll get something of Fred's.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.876
Here, darling. Put this on him.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.555
- Now you get out of those wet clothes.
- I love the wet clothes!

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.279
Thank you for a marvellous party! Whoa!

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:32.911
Fred, darling, I had to loan him your terry.
He's soaking wet. This is hers, not his.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.629
Oh, darling, do hurry because
the Russians will be here any minute.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.030
- The Russians?
- The dancers, darling. The ballet!

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.269
- Come on, sidekick.
- No, no.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.351
Kelso, would you mind...

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.749
- What are you doing?
- I am not doing anything.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.593
- You're wetting the bed.
- I am not wetting the bed.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.035
My clothes are wetting the bed.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:04.318
- This is the big chief here.
- Oh! Big chief speak with forked tongue.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.551
Partener, he's a... He's a TV partener.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.872
- I'll hold him. You get his pants down.
- All right.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.078
- Come here, lovely man. I love you.
- I got something dry over here.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.113
Here, Wild Bill, you take off your coat...

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.591
No, no, no, no!

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.274
Oh, no, Wild Bill! No, no!

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:41.273
- Get up off the floor.
- I got him. Slippery little critter, ain't he?

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.714
- Oh, you naughty man!
- Here, put this on.

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:48.390
- Put these on.
- Why? Why?

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.631
Can you handle him? I have to
go downstairs. Take care of it.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.188
- I'll handle it.
- Wild Bill, why do you want...

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:58.876
- Little sidekick, put these dry clothes on.
- All right. I will put them on.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.397
Good idea. I gotta get downstairs
before Conchita cools off.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:07.837
You come down with wet clothes on, I'll
stomp you and the horse you ride in on.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.229
- Got that?
- Buddy... Partner buddy.

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:12.993
I'll see you, little buddy.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:16.755
Oh! You got me right in
the pantaloons, partener!

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.116
Adios! Hold on, Conchita! I'm comin'!

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.191
Adios, partener.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.031
Oh, no...

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.911
Hello.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.031
Hello.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.475
You are having some difficulty?

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.231
No.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.631
Are you sure?

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.951
Well...

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.671
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.039
You know that I don't think you are
being entirely honest with me?

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.951
No.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.511
Ah.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.391
We have a saying in India.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.551
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.677
- Well?
- Well what?

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.314
You were saying something
about a saying?

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.473
Oh, yes.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.034
What is it?

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.030
"Wisdom... is the province of the aged...

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.475
...but the heart of a child is pure. "

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.153
That's very pretty.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.032
I'm not sure I know what it means.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.229
Neither do I.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.075
What does it have to do with me?

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.878
Well, it has everything to do with you.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:06.475
- For one thing, it stopped you crying.
- It's true.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.869
I feel better. Thank you very much.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.953
- Don't thank me. Thank my saying.
- Thank you, saying.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.270
- Do you want to hear another saying?
- Yes.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.318
This is a good one because
it will help you to remember...

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.994
...how many days there are in each month.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.358
It goes like this: "30 days have
September, October, June and February. "

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.514
"All the rest got 29
except my brother, who got six months. "

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.756
Aha. Just what I thought.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.831
I've been lookin' all over for you.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.037
- Get your clothes. We're gonna leave.
- I don't think so.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.272
Look, you came with me. You're gonna
leave with me. Now get your clothes.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.079
- No.
- Don't say no to me! Now get your stuff.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.116
- Go on!
- Mr Divot, please...

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.159
- Just stay out of this, buddy.
- If she wishes to remain, that is her right.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:01.518
<i>- Just who do you think you are?
- In India, we know who we are.</i>

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.433
- You're meshuga!
- I am not your sugar.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.877
Baby, you decide. You wanna come
with me or stay with this guy?

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.032
- I want to stay.
- You're gonna stay with him, huh?

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.758
OK.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.718
Nobody ever does this
to me. You hear that?

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:21.954
And forget about that test. You're finished
in this business before you even start!

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.116
Well, that was a short career, wasn't it?

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.229
Oh, don't worry about that.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.709
I'd better find something
to put on and call a cab.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.234
No, don't call a cab. Stay at the party.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.437
And after, I'll take you home
in my three-wheeler Morgan.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.318
- No. That would be nice, but I can't stay.
- Why not?

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.916
Well, I... I got myself
into a funny situation.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.514
- What, with old Divot?
- Yes.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.716
Is that why you were crying?

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:00.156
- Yes. It's not really his fault.
- He's a terrible man.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.879
Please, stay. Let's have a wonderful time.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.554
I'd love to, really,
but I have nothing to wear.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:11.033
That's no problem. They have millions of
clothes here. Anyway, I've got an idea.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.795
- Who goes there?
- Shh! Mr Bakshi and a damsel in distress.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.674
- What do you want?
- Well, you look like a man of the world.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.558
This poor lady is urgently
in need of some dry clothing...

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.359
...and I perceive that you are
both about the same size.

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.958
Marvellous! Just marvellous!

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.713
Everyone, let's toast
our wonderful friends!

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.435
- We need to move the bar.
- What?

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.637
- We have to move the bar!
- Oh, I know how to do that! I'll do it.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.870
Oh, no. I'd rather...

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.632
Fred, stop him.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.591
Oh! Fred!

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.754
- Come on.
- Molly, are you sure it's all right?

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.230
- Yes! Will you please come?
- But your mother is havin' a party!

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.916
- What better time to shake 'em up?
- You've done some stupid things but...

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.470
Hi.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.716
- Hello, Mom.
- Darling! Weren't you out protesting?

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.950
It's a love-in. Meet some of my friends.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.032
I can't now, darling.
I've got all these wet Russians.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.555
But I'll come back and meet your friends.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.756
Oh, there they are, over there.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.868
- General, your wife just fell in the pool.
- Get her jewellery.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.797
- Molly, what was that?
- An elephant.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.236
- An ele...
- Yes. You don't have to be so shook up.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.194
Molly, how could you do
such a dreadful thing?

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.272
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Now listen here, young lady.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.272
You get that elephant
out of this house at once!

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.078
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.469
- How are you?
- Fine. Is this your elephant?

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.155
- Yes. This is Jongo.
- You've done a proper paint job on this!

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.390
- You should be ashamed of yourself!
- Why?

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.357
This is a symbol of my country.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.877
- Don't you paint them in India?
- Yes, but we don't paint slogans on them.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.235
He's got "The world is flat"
on his forehead...

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.313
"Socrates eats hemlock" on the side,
and "Go naked" all over his bum!

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:34.791
- We didn't mean to be disrespectful.
- But it's humiliating. They know.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.633
How would you like it
if an Indian person came along...

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.429
...and drew a moustache on your ladybirds?
It's the same thing, isn't it?

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.433
- I'm awfully sorry. What should we do?
- Get some water and wash it off.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.159
Wash it, scrub it, get it off, hose it off...

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.232
Hey, gang!
We're gonna wash the elephant!

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.151
How many times I gotta tell you?

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.199
You ain't never gonna find anything
in here half as sweet as I am.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.870
Take it outside! Come on, let's go!

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.520
No! You fainted. Come on!

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.550
All right, all right! Everybody out!

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.234
Wash it off! Take it all off!

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.871
Bakshi!

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.869
I knew I knew that guy!
I knew it. I knew it.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.594
Hello. Uh... Buckercult...

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.433
I wanna talk to the General.
This is CS Divot.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.870
No, no! You can't just...

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.157
What's goin' on there?

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.031
A bit on the ear!

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.436
Do you believe that child of mine,
bringing home an elephant?

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.192
- They're dirty.
- Oh, really!

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.438
All right! Enough! Enough!

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.911
We take him outside now
and wash all the soap off!

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.157
What do you suppose
that awful racket is? I'll be right back.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.356
- I'm not finished.
- I've got to see.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.510
God only knows what's happening now!

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.271
Mom! What are you doing?

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.432
You and I have gotta
find someplace to be alone!

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.791
Get up!

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.992
Save the paintings!

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.831
Mom! Are you all right?

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.439
Get the paintings. Don't just stand there!

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.632
We're certainly having a lot of trouble.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.191
I just never, ever,
in all my life... I just never...

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.236
Not that one, you idiot!
Just the good stuff! Put it back!

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.119
We gotta get rid of it.
Turn on the air conditioning.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:28.478
- I'll never make it.
- There's a control in the master bedroom.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.071
<i>(# "The Party")</i>

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:43.198
<i># The party gets groovy
and everyone here loses control, yeah...</i>

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:50.156
<i># Our minds fly away, as the band
starts to play we rock and roll...</i>

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.151
<i># Come on, baby, listen to me here now...</i>

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.676
<i># No time for meditations...</i>

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:59.476
<i># Just feel the wild vibrations...</i>

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:03.071
<i># We'll learn some new sensations...</i>

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.958

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.111
<i># All night long...</i>

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.428
<i># Yeah!</i>

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:33.557
<i># The party goes crazy
as we see the night turn into day, yeah...</i>

<i># And that's when you find
your inhibited mind is blown away...</i>

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.037
<i># Come on, baby, listen to me here now...</i>

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.908
<i># We'll swing till we're insane here...</i>

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.709
<i># Easy to blow your brain here...</i>

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.110
<i># That's why we'll all remain here...</i>

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.839
<i># Tonight...</i>

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.510
<i># All night long...</i>

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.470
<i># All night long...</i>

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.190
<i># All night long...</i>

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.712
<i># All night long...</i>

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.518
- Just a minute, sir.
- I'm CS Divot, the producer.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:30.071
I'm a friend of Mr Clutterbuck's.
I gotta tell him something right away.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:35.191
Hey, what's with the ambulance?

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.874
Hey, let's go struggle in the straw, huh?

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.515
What the hell is goin' on around here?

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.670
Argh!

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.958
- Do you believe it? The party isn't over!
- Hey, General!

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.031
I don't even know how it got started.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.839
- We've got to do a report.
- I'll talk to the governor.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:58.230
- I gotta tell you something!
- It was crazy! You should've seen it!

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.756
- Alice, baby, do you feel better?
- Oh, I'm fine!

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:05.992
- I'm going to be in the aquacade!
- That's nice. Don't drop her.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.709
Congressman and Mrs Dunphy,
I don't know how to tell you...

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.349
It's quite all right.
Call me if there's anything I can do.

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.151
Mr Clutterbuck...

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:27.193
...may I apologise to you
for the discomfort...

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.794
- It's all right.
- General, it's him!

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.677
- Who?
- Bakshi!

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.070
He's the idiot who blew up the location!

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.551
You got the wrong guy!

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:49.470
Hey, little buddy! Hold on! Here's
one of my old Stetsons. It just fits.

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:53.189
And here's an autographed picture
of me and my horse Fang.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.240
<i># Nothing to lose...</i>

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:10.752
<i># If we are wise...</i>

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:17.439
<i># We're not expecting
rainbow-coloured skies...</i>

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.512
<i># Not right away...</i>

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:27.593
<i># Nothing to lose...</i>

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:31.798
<i># It might be fun...</i>

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:37.477
<i># No talk of spending lifetimes in the sun...</i>

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.319
Well, this is where I live.

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.391
A beautiful home.

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.430
I would ask you to come up but...
it's a little late.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.511
Or early. I don't know.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.997
Anyway, I have to get back to feed Apu.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:58.032
- Apu?
- Yes. My monkey.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.712
Oh.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:03.231
It's a lovely name - For a monkey, anyway.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.117
- He's used to it by now, anyway.
- Good.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:14.351
I would like to say that
I enjoyed myself very much last night.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.317
I did too. Very much.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.198
Especially I thought
your song was very beautiful.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.271
- You did?
- Yes.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.351
Thank you.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.031
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:31.031
Oh. Here's your hat.

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:34.112
Oh, look... You keep it.

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.313
But you may need it.

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:40.278
No, I'd like you to keep it.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.191
All right.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.078
If you should want it
or need it sometimes...

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.870
Well... if I need it, I could always
come perhaps and pick it up.

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.438
That would be very nice.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.069
When would you be available
for me to pick up my hat?

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.789
Well... Maybe next week.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.989
- I'll come and get it then.
- OK.

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:07.119
- I would love to have my hat back.
- Goodbye.
