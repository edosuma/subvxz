<i>And you're listening</i>
<i>to WZPZ 720 on your A.M. dial.</i>

00:24.116 --> 00:26.470
<i>The lines are open now,</i>
<i>so now's your chance.</i>

00:27.558 --> 00:28.570
<i>There's still no information</i>

00:28.621 --> 00:31.031
<i>on the disappearance of
six Lansdale residents.</i>

00:31.066 --> 00:31.952
Forgot my gear.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.426
- Hurry, I don't want to miss kickoff.
- <i>If you see anything</i>

00:33.497 --> 00:34.834
<i>or anyone suspicious,</i>

00:34.835 --> 00:37.060
<i>please contact</i>
<i>Sheriff Golightly's office.</i>

00:37.061 --> 00:38.826
<i>All calls are anonymous.</i>

00:38.947 --> 00:40.613
<i>Well, that's it for me.</i>
<i>Cheryl Clark is up next</i>

00:40.655 --> 00:42.123
<i>to keep you company</i>
<i>all the way home.</i>

00:56.563 --> 00:58.131
<i>Let's go, Raymond.</i>

00:58.132 --> 01:00.392
- <i>What's the holdup?</i>
- <i>Just a second.</i>

01:48.312 --> 01:49.808
Aah!

01:57.918 --> 01:58.933
<i>Raymond!</i>

02:04.691 --> 02:05.882
Raymond!

02:18.854 --> 02:22.576
"Night of Desirable Objects"

02:36.754 --> 02:37.415
There you go.

02:37.756 --> 02:38.826
Thank you.

02:39.157 --> 02:40.392
You take care,
Agent Dunham.

02:40.424 --> 02:41.258
I will.

02:49.200 --> 02:49.731
Let me get that.

02:49.987 --> 02:51.144
Peter, I'm fine.

02:52.436 --> 02:53.703
I know you are.

02:54.839 --> 02:55.771
What?

02:56.123 --> 02:57.127
Well...

02:59.076 --> 03:00.723
Just looking
for the hidden ninja sword.

03:00.878 --> 03:04.013
Well, that one
wasn't covered by insurance.

03:06.819 --> 03:07.641
Thank you.

03:08.552 --> 03:09.818
Did you check
the drawers?

03:10.287 --> 03:13.268
No. Anything I've forgotten,
they can keep.

03:13.303 --> 03:14.857
I don't want to spend
another minute here.

03:14.858 --> 03:17.537
I'm, uh, no good
at sitting around.

03:18.061 --> 03:19.717
You're also no good
at letting people help you.

03:20.363 --> 03:22.457
Oh, I'll let you carry
my suitcase.

04:52.157 --> 04:53.987
Aah!

04:59.980 --> 05:01.526
Did you get me
everything on my list?

05:01.935 --> 05:03.701
The FBI signed off
on everything you asked for,

05:03.721 --> 05:05.532
including new housing
for you and your father.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.808
But the C-130
transport plane

05:07.843 --> 05:09.544
is proving a bit tough
to requisition.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.892
We're not gonna need it
for this one.

05:16.150 --> 05:16.929
Pennsylvania?

05:17.156 --> 05:18.892
I was trolling
the FBI databases,

05:18.927 --> 05:20.760
looking for any cases
that were similar to Olivia's.

05:20.761 --> 05:22.228
Sudden disappearances.

05:22.229 --> 05:23.948
This town has had
six missing people

05:23.983 --> 05:25.404
in the last two months,
four of which

05:25.433 --> 05:28.207
eyewitnesses say just
disappeared into thin air.

05:28.770 --> 05:30.060
Thought it was worth
checking out.

05:32.407 --> 05:34.625
- How is she?
- Olivia?

05:36.011 --> 05:37.055
She'll be fine.

05:40.989 --> 05:41.914
Do it.

05:43.053 --> 05:45.024
And keep a close eye
on Dunham.

05:46.007 --> 05:48.419
All right, Walter,
the cameras are ready.

05:49.252 --> 05:50.418
Here we go.

05:50.453 --> 05:53.149
Agent Dunham,
you're just in time.

05:53.184 --> 05:54.674
Just in time for what?

05:54.709 --> 05:56.464
We're re-creating
your car accident.

05:56.499 --> 05:58.021
Okay, Astrid, ready.

05:58.056 --> 06:00.190
3... 2... 1.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.101
- The photographs, quickly.
- I know, Walter.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.700
<i>Y-your accident--</i>

06:11.735 --> 06:13.348
I'm--I'm testing
a theory.

06:13.728 --> 06:14.658
Oh.

06:15.789 --> 06:17.658
Thank you.
Excuse me.

06:18.292 --> 06:19.135
Uh...

06:21.701 --> 06:22.859
No matter what I try,

06:22.894 --> 06:25.443
I can't make
the frog disappear.

06:25.601 --> 06:27.586
We've been at this
for five hours.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.017
Science is patience!

06:29.052 --> 06:30.604
It's also slimy.

06:30.707 --> 06:31.959
From all the evidence,

06:32.576 --> 06:35.545
you were missing from your car
for at least an hour

06:35.546 --> 06:38.072
before you came crashing
back through the windshield.

06:40.352 --> 06:42.407
You simply disappeared.

06:43.456 --> 06:46.298
He thinks you traveled
to another universe.

06:47.744 --> 06:49.972
You see, Agent Dunham,

06:51.145 --> 06:55.253
we assume that our universe
is the only universe.

06:55.288 --> 06:56.386
But that's not true.

06:56.605 --> 06:58.993
There is an infinite
number of universes.

06:59.028 --> 07:01.867
And in each of them,
there is a version of us--

07:01.902 --> 07:04.437
<i>You, me,</i>
<i>and Agent Farnsworth--</i>

07:04.647 --> 07:07.293
But each one
slightly different...

07:08.093 --> 07:09.518
Changed over time

07:09.519 --> 07:13.202
based on the accumulation
of our choices.

07:13.693 --> 07:14.316
So...

07:14.351 --> 07:15.766
in this reality--

07:15.801 --> 07:16.578
<i>Walter.</i>

07:19.922 --> 07:22.542
We've had this conversation
before, haven't we?

07:25.237 --> 07:27.004
I know that I went
somewhere.

07:27.340 --> 07:29.835
I think
I met with someone.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.196
<i>But the rest is like</i>

07:33.231 --> 07:34.595
a dream that I...

07:35.598 --> 07:37.693
I just can't
quite remember.

07:38.355 --> 07:39.829
Perhaps you will...

07:40.052 --> 07:41.299
in time.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.032
When they said
you were dead...

07:51.497 --> 07:53.864
When I saw you
lying there...

08:00.372 --> 08:02.556
I don't know
what I would have done.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.828
Walter...

08:10.050 --> 08:13.333
But you're here now,
and apart from the obvious, you...

08:13.921 --> 08:15.159
You appear to be fine.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.222
I appear to be?

08:17.547 --> 08:18.164
No.

08:18.794 --> 08:21.695
Traveling
to an alternate reality

08:21.696 --> 08:23.013
<i>has its consequences.</i>

08:24.717 --> 08:26.896
No. No,
you'll be fine.

08:28.838 --> 08:29.772
<i>Hey.</i>

08:31.306 --> 08:33.484
You feel up to going
for a drive?

08:48.565 --> 08:49.873
<i>Put it in back there.</i>

08:51.328 --> 08:53.440
Hello. Hello.

08:53.747 --> 08:55.478
Hello.
I'm Walter Bishop.

08:57.202 --> 08:58.170
<i>Hello.</i>

08:58.841 --> 09:00.076
Uh, Sheriff Golightly?

09:00.305 --> 09:02.507
Special Agent
Olivia Dunham.

09:02.508 --> 09:05.308
This is Peter
and Walter Bishop.

09:05.311 --> 09:07.199
Don't remember calling
the FBI.

09:07.234 --> 09:10.230
Well, your office has filed
six Missing-Persons reports.

09:11.492 --> 09:12.402
Seven now.

09:13.405 --> 09:14.271
Seven.

09:14.355 --> 09:16.222
All under the same
circumstances?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.358
Same as the others.
Just disappear.

09:19.066 --> 09:20.760
Be damned if I know
what to make of it.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.263
Well, we're all victims
of our own gene pool.

09:23.298 --> 09:24.977
Someone must have peed
in yours.

09:26.434 --> 09:28.616
I-I'm sorry, you'll have
to excuse my father.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.263
<i>Yes. Excuse me.</i>

09:30.298 --> 09:31.338
Sheriff.

09:31.339 --> 09:34.863
These two men are both special
investigators with the FBI.

09:34.898 --> 09:36.177
<i>And when the good</i>
<i>men and women</i>

09:36.212 --> 09:38.043
who have come here
from three separate counties

09:38.078 --> 09:39.517
have finished
collecting evidence,

09:39.552 --> 09:40.840
then you can see it.

09:46.956 --> 09:48.380
Let me see
what you got.

09:50.393 --> 09:51.431
<i>May I?</i>

09:54.831 --> 09:56.033
Wonderful!

09:56.068 --> 09:58.160
Have you run across
something like this before?

09:58.195 --> 10:00.027
Absolutely not.

10:00.537 --> 10:03.629
The air here
is quite auspicious!

10:06.087 --> 10:08.999
Makes the hair stand up
on the back of your neck.

10:09.621 --> 10:10.529
The air.

10:10.815 --> 10:11.934
This!

10:13.084 --> 10:16.380
It's a fresh mystery,
pregnant with possibilities.

10:16.421 --> 10:18.256
Who knows where
it may lead?

10:24.199 --> 10:25.506
I bet you he knows.

10:33.223 --> 10:35.452
<i>Here are</i>
<i>the investigation files.</i>

10:35.453 --> 10:37.831
Everything we have so far
from the first disappearance,

10:37.944 --> 10:39.747
which is not a hell
of a lot.

10:40.312 --> 10:41.907
Possible suspect
interviews,

10:41.942 --> 10:43.362
case leads,

10:43.717 --> 10:45.631
dead ends
from the disappearances.

10:45.666 --> 10:46.594
Okay.
Thank you.

10:46.629 --> 10:47.519
Agent Dunham...

10:48.240 --> 10:51.240
The FBI
has very specific laws

10:51.275 --> 10:53.930
that govern what
their jurisdiction involves.

10:53.965 --> 10:56.577
None of these disappearances
occurred on a military base.

10:56.612 --> 10:57.850
<i>None of them happened</i>
<i>across state lines.</i>

10:57.885 --> 10:59.625
You've already given us
evidence to analyze.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.410
- There's information in these files--
- I understand.

11:01.445 --> 11:03.515
But I can get a special
procedural order to--

11:03.550 --> 11:05.122
Why are you so interested
in this case?

11:14.714 --> 11:15.979
Excuse me?

11:16.014 --> 11:17.926
Why are you so interested
in this case?

11:17.961 --> 11:19.019
I, um...

11:21.026 --> 11:22.740
I-I'm sorry, I-I--

11:22.775 --> 11:24.658
The night
of desirable objects?

11:26.085 --> 11:27.861
I have one
just like this.

11:29.695 --> 11:31.528
You know yourself a little bit
about night fishing, do you?

11:31.529 --> 11:33.542
I've used hair jigs
and pork rind,

11:33.577 --> 11:35.556
<i>rubber jigs
for largemouth.</i>

11:35.591 --> 11:37.016
<i>You ever try using</i>
<i>spinnerbaits at night?</i>

11:37.051 --> 11:37.608
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

11:37.643 --> 11:39.429
<i>You can use pork rind</i>
<i>with those too, you know.</i>

11:39.464 --> 11:40.444
- <i>Can you really?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:40.505 --> 11:41.706
<i>I like</i>
<i>the topwater...</i>

11:48.035 --> 11:49.376
<i>Agent Francis.</i>

11:49.411 --> 11:50.988
- Hey, it's me.
- <i>Hey.</i>

11:51.023 --> 11:52.829
Look, I'm sending you
a victim sheet

11:52.864 --> 11:54.731
from a multiple
Missing-Persons case

11:54.766 --> 11:55.716
in Pennsylvania.

11:56.021 --> 11:58.089
Can you run the names and, um...

11:58.090 --> 12:00.825
And notify me
if any red flags come up?

12:00.826 --> 12:02.694
<i>Sure. I just have to run</i>
<i>an errand.</i>

12:02.695 --> 12:05.163
Okay. Thanks, Charlie.
Bye.

12:18.168 --> 12:20.305
<i>I'll be with you in, uh--</i>
<i>in just a minute.</i>

12:22.548 --> 12:25.530
<i>I need the back room.</i>

12:28.654 --> 12:30.709
<i>Now!</i>

13:20.305 --> 13:21.871
Oh, this is
wildly helpful.

13:22.703 --> 13:23.723
According to the sheriff,

13:23.758 --> 13:25.127
the second person
who disappeared--

13:25.158 --> 13:27.146
His mom makes
a mean apple pie.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.160
In case
you were wondering,

13:28.161 --> 13:30.477
Andre Hughes
is partial to flannel.

13:30.512 --> 13:31.797
He likes to wear
flannel shirts,

13:31.798 --> 13:34.045
except, of course,
in the summer.

13:37.971 --> 13:39.565
I'm gonna go
get a soda.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.612
- <i>You want something?</i>
- <i>No, thank you.</i>

13:42.527 --> 13:43.125
Hmm.

13:45.147 --> 13:46.297
How's it going,
Walter?

13:46.415 --> 13:48.867
I plan to urinate
in 23 minutes.

13:49.073 --> 13:49.890
Good to know.

13:50.284 --> 13:50.919
<i>I'm telling you</i>

13:50.920 --> 13:53.398
because I'm going to need
help unzipping my fly.

13:53.650 --> 13:55.454
<i>I can't feel my hand.</i>

13:55.489 --> 13:59.128
It seems the substance from
Pennsylvania is a paralytic.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.843
Which means that whoever
took those people

14:01.878 --> 14:03.200
paralyzed them first,

14:03.235 --> 14:04.364
so they couldn't fight back.

14:04.399 --> 14:07.451
Interesting theory.
Very devious.

14:08.384 --> 14:10.134
Do you think we can trace it,
where it's from?

14:10.809 --> 14:13.873
The base solution
contains human DNA,

14:13.908 --> 14:14.806
male, I think.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.687
Of course,
it's a mutation.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.359
Perhaps a whole new stage
of human evolution.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.225
Wouldn't that be fantastic?

14:24.055 --> 14:26.001
If we've stumbled
upon a mutant?

14:26.692 --> 14:29.563
No. Fantastic's not the first
word that pops into my mind.

14:29.598 --> 14:31.019
We're all mutants.

14:31.492 --> 14:32.997
What's more remarkable...

14:33.832 --> 14:35.970
is how many of us
appear to be normal.

14:38.361 --> 14:39.170
Find anything?

14:39.205 --> 14:40.948
Hey, you remember
Andre Hughes?

14:40.983 --> 14:44.148
Uh, yeah, Hughes.
He was the flannel guy, right?

14:44.183 --> 14:46.245
Yeah, well, he's a neighbor
of the Shanes,

14:46.280 --> 14:47.602
and he was
at their house

14:47.637 --> 14:48.779
when the sheriff went
to follow up

14:48.814 --> 14:49.917
on their son's disappearance.

14:49.918 --> 14:52.019
He was also
at the Thomasons'

14:52.020 --> 14:54.215
just after Jennifer Thomason
disappeared.

14:55.090 --> 14:58.118
Sheriff Golightly arrived
just as Hughes was leaving.

14:58.525 --> 14:59.466
What are you thinking?

14:59.501 --> 15:00.687
I'm thinking you drive.

15:25.256 --> 15:27.552
No! No!

15:31.931 --> 15:33.635
Aw, hell.

16:18.953 --> 16:20.067
Aw, hell.

16:22.204 --> 16:23.239
<i>Who are you?</i>

16:23.246 --> 16:24.644
Ah, Mr. Hughes.

16:25.439 --> 16:28.073
<i>Olivia Dunham,</i>
<i>and this is Peter Bishop.</i>

16:28.108 --> 16:30.512
We're wanting to ask you
a few questions.

16:33.188 --> 16:35.378
FBI. Oh.

16:37.659 --> 16:38.630
Uh...

16:39.427 --> 16:40.227
I assume you've heard

16:40.228 --> 16:42.894
about the people that have
recently gone missing.

16:44.008 --> 16:44.671
Uh, yeah.

16:46.001 --> 16:47.333
I know about it.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.688
<i>I'd love to help</i>
<i>if I can.</i>

16:50.024 --> 16:50.838
Please...

16:54.241 --> 16:54.982
After you.

16:56.344 --> 16:58.779
<i>Either of you have any</i>
<i>experience with water wells?</i>

16:58.780 --> 16:59.461
No.

16:59.781 --> 17:01.067
No. Ah.

17:01.364 --> 17:03.472
This time of year
I spend most of my time

17:03.718 --> 17:05.292
<i>maintaining and...</i>

17:05.954 --> 17:06.969
digging 'em out.

17:08.457 --> 17:10.590
I wouldn't wish it
on either of you.

17:12.811 --> 17:13.406
Eh.

17:15.229 --> 17:16.830
It's like
to drive me crazy.

17:20.694 --> 17:22.952
<i>This is my fifth well</i>
<i>in two months.</i>

17:22.987 --> 17:25.030
<i>Can't seem to find</i>
<i>that switch button.</i>

17:25.571 --> 17:26.837
<i>I'm just gonna go</i>
<i>in the other room</i>

17:26.872 --> 17:28.281
<i>and wash this dirt off.</i>

17:29.085 --> 17:30.669
Make yourself
comfortable.

17:33.539 --> 17:34.320
Excuse me.

17:35.985 --> 17:38.082
Is there someone else
in this house?

17:40.223 --> 17:41.433
No.

17:50.866 --> 17:52.718
There's someone else
in this house.

17:53.751 --> 17:55.037
Did you hear that?

17:58.007 --> 17:59.301
Keep him busy.

19:08.757 --> 19:09.853
Come out of there.

19:24.492 --> 19:26.705
Oh! Peter!
Oh, my God.

19:26.740 --> 19:29.206
<i>Oh, Peter, oh, my God,</i>
<i>I-I--I'm so sorry!</i>

19:29.241 --> 19:30.279
I thought
I heard something.

19:30.365 --> 19:32.848
I thought I--
I thought I heard someone.

19:37.205 --> 19:38.971
You fired
a gun in my house,

19:39.241 --> 19:40.865
and now you're
bringing me down here?

19:41.044 --> 19:42.552
I don't understand.

19:44.496 --> 19:46.226
You don't think
I had anything to do

19:46.261 --> 19:47.898
with these missing people,
do you?

19:49.272 --> 19:51.284
Well, at the moment,
Mr. Hughes,

19:51.319 --> 19:53.382
we're just trying
to gather information.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.732
So I understand
that you're a doctor.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.121
Yes.

20:01.230 --> 20:02.915
But you retired

20:02.950 --> 20:05.235
<i>nearly 20 years ago.</i>

20:05.270 --> 20:06.105
<i>That's right.</i>

20:07.870 --> 20:10.402
- Anything?
- Not yet.

20:10.437 --> 20:11.615
<i>What have you done</i>
<i>since then?</i>

20:11.650 --> 20:12.506
We scoured the house.

20:13.272 --> 20:13.975
There's no evidence

20:14.010 --> 20:15.665
that links him
to the disappearances.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.190
Just a bunch
of old lab equipment.

20:17.245 --> 20:19.508
We had it packed up,
sent over to Harvard.

20:19.543 --> 20:21.295
Walter's taking a look
at it now.

20:21.330 --> 20:23.005
<i>According</i>
<i>to our records,</i>

20:23.040 --> 20:24.447
<i>in the wake</i>
<i>of the disappearances,</i>

20:24.482 --> 20:26.765
<i>you visited with some</i>
<i>of the victims' relatives.</i>

20:27.556 --> 20:30.851
<i>With, uh,</i>
<i>Martin Shane's mother</i>

20:30.886 --> 20:32.460
<i>and, uh...</i>

20:32.461 --> 20:34.787
Jennifer Thomason's
husband.

20:35.298 --> 20:36.365
Yes.

20:37.024 --> 20:38.368
Were they former patients?

20:39.525 --> 20:40.872
No.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.568
Just friends?

20:43.307 --> 20:46.297
I hardly knew
either of them.

20:48.224 --> 20:50.517
But I thought
I could help them.

20:52.650 --> 20:56.854
<i>I... I thought</i>
<i>I could comfort them.</i>

21:01.221 --> 21:04.702
I lost my wife and my son
17 years ago.

21:05.431 --> 21:09.345
<i>She died,</i>
<i>giving birth to him.</i>

21:12.840 --> 21:14.442
He was mine.

21:16.389 --> 21:18.111
For five minutes,
I had a son.

21:25.054 --> 21:29.400
I could never hurt
these people.

21:33.129 --> 21:36.247
<i>Mr. Hughes, we'd like to take</i>
<i>a sample of your blood.</i>

21:36.333 --> 21:40.333
We'd like to compare it
to some evidence that we found

21:40.368 --> 21:43.150
at the scene
of the last disappearance.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.622
Do we, uh, have
your permission to do that?

21:51.818 --> 21:53.746
Am I under arrest?

21:53.781 --> 21:55.192
Not presently.

21:55.789 --> 21:56.923
Then, no.

21:58.069 --> 21:59.362
<i>No.</i>

22:02.230 --> 22:04.875
You don't have
my permission.

22:07.167 --> 22:08.943
I'll get a warrant
to take his blood.

22:08.978 --> 22:11.339
Have Olivia hold him
for 24 hours.

22:12.942 --> 22:15.821
It says in her report
Dunham's gun went off?

22:16.847 --> 22:19.424
Yeah. Misfire.

22:26.626 --> 22:29.060
<i>I'll send Agent Jessup</i>
<i>to the Hughes' house.</i>

22:32.592 --> 22:33.366
<i>Dizziness?</i>

22:33.995 --> 22:34.530
No.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.604
How's your
short-term memory?

22:38.639 --> 22:39.948
Uh, what's your name?

22:40.676 --> 22:42.177
<i>Good.</i>

22:42.178 --> 22:43.512
<i>You seem to be</i>
<i>doing well.</i>

22:43.513 --> 22:45.260
<i>You can go ahead</i>
<i>and get dressed.</i>

22:56.202 --> 22:57.238
Hello, Agent Dunham.

22:59.971 --> 23:03.805
I haven't had a chance to visit
since your... accident,

23:03.840 --> 23:05.927
but Agent Broyles
has been keeping me apprised.

23:06.495 --> 23:07.705
I was concerned.

23:07.740 --> 23:10.023
Well, thanks.
I-I'm doing okay.

23:10.436 --> 23:11.512
I'm glad to hear that...

23:12.327 --> 23:14.602
Though sometimes
the physical injury

23:14.637 --> 23:16.107
is the easiest
to get over.

23:16.986 --> 23:21.239
I remember when I was
first diagnosed with cancer.

23:22.133 --> 23:23.231
Beside the fear,

23:23.266 --> 23:26.044
my most overwhelming
sensation

23:26.079 --> 23:27.341
<i>was one of betrayal...</i>

23:28.807 --> 23:30.497
The realization
that my own body

23:30.532 --> 23:32.259
was fundamentally
foreign to me,

23:32.294 --> 23:33.473
that it was a threat.

23:36.072 --> 23:38.591
You've been through
quite an ordeal, Olivia--

23:39.004 --> 23:40.166
One of many lately.

23:40.579 --> 23:42.878
To overlook it
would be a mistake.

23:47.184 --> 23:48.044
What's this?

23:48.079 --> 23:51.166
Sam Weiss, the man who helped
put me back together.

23:53.123 --> 23:55.940
You know,
the FBI has psychologists.

23:56.562 --> 23:57.479
If I thought
that I needed--

23:57.514 --> 23:59.972
Well, he's not
a psychologist.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.139
When you're ready,
I believe he can help you.

25:04.795 --> 25:05.923
Okay. Thanks.

25:08.444 --> 25:11.218
<i>That was Olivia--</i>
<i>Agent Jessup told her</i>

25:11.253 --> 25:14.049
Hughes may have killed
his wife and child 17 years ago.

25:14.277 --> 25:16.505
Oh, finally
some good news.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.333
I assume
we can dig them up.

25:19.298 --> 25:21.390
I haven't had
any bodies to examine.

25:21.425 --> 25:23.997
Seven missing persons,

25:24.032 --> 25:25.362
no bodies.

25:25.397 --> 25:27.921
All right.
I'll get an exhumation order.

25:41.137 --> 25:42.502
Put his wife's
coffin is down here.

25:49.983 --> 26:00.906
If Hughes
is hiding something,

26:00.941 --> 26:02.156
we're gonna find out
what it is.

26:13.068 --> 26:14.523
Okay, let's open it up.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.362
<i>Let's open</i>
<i>the baby boy's.</i>

26:38.927 --> 26:40.030
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

26:40.362 --> 26:41.526
There's no body.

26:44.666 --> 26:46.919
Looks like something
dug its way in.

26:48.437 --> 26:49.964
Or dug its way out.

27:03.084 --> 27:04.456
<i>I think</i>
<i>we have some questions</i>

27:04.536 --> 27:05.752
<i>for Mr. Hughes.</i>

28:00.090 --> 28:01.426
<i>That's curious.</i>

28:01.937 --> 28:02.805
<i>What?</i>

28:03.478 --> 28:04.599
<i>What's curious?</i>

28:05.974 --> 28:07.661
Mrs. Hughes has...

28:07.843 --> 28:09.437
scarring to the joints,

28:10.812 --> 28:12.944
butterfly lesions
to the face.

28:13.482 --> 28:15.896
Systemic lupus
erythematosus,

28:15.984 --> 28:18.296
a very advanced case.

28:18.787 --> 28:20.173
Lupus?

28:20.208 --> 28:21.756
Which means what?

28:22.058 --> 28:25.624
Notably, she was incapable
of producing offspring.

28:26.128 --> 28:28.359
Except she did.
She had a baby boy.

28:28.698 --> 28:29.382
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:31.000 --> 28:32.260
A baby boy?

28:34.103 --> 28:35.393
<i>That's impossible.</i>

28:36.105 --> 28:38.949
Lupus results
in an overactive immune system.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.204
Her own body
would have destroyed the fetus

28:41.239 --> 28:42.878
- long before--
- Yes, and yet despite that,

28:42.913 --> 28:44.865
she was somehow able
to give birth to a son.

28:45.414 --> 28:46.758
<i>Who,</i>
<i>from all appearances,</i>

28:46.759 --> 28:48.717
then burrowed his way
out of his casket.

28:50.352 --> 28:52.398
The grave of a boy...

28:54.476 --> 28:56.829
who was not
in his grave.

29:31.602 --> 29:32.568
<i>How the hell</i>
<i>did this happen?</i>

29:32.603 --> 29:34.183
<i>Why wasn't anyone</i>
<i>watching him?</i>

29:34.218 --> 29:35.588
<i>We're looking into it
right now.</i>

29:36.198 --> 29:38.067
We need to have
Andre Hughes' body

29:38.102 --> 29:40.787
taken back to Walter Bishop's
lab as soon as possible.

29:40.870 --> 29:41.932
Already on its way.

29:41.933 --> 29:44.122
<i>Hey, Jim, it's Alex.</i>
<i>Yeah, I know I'm late.</i>

29:44.339 --> 29:46.031
<i>Yeah, I'm leaving
right now, alright?</i>

29:46.066 --> 29:46.774
<i>Yeah, I understand.</i>

29:46.775 --> 29:49.409
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>
<i>I'll call him right now.</i>

29:53.649 --> 29:54.544
Agent Dunham?

30:03.658 --> 30:04.495
Agent Dunham?

30:09.130 --> 30:10.184
Peter, I've got it.

30:11.366 --> 30:12.766
Mrs. Hughes' womb.

30:12.767 --> 30:15.714
You were right.
She did give birth.

30:15.961 --> 30:17.283
I'm glad
we got that settled.

30:17.527 --> 30:19.202
The afterbirth
is still inside her.

30:19.237 --> 30:21.343
<i>Look. Look at the tissue</i>
<i>composition.</i>

30:23.144 --> 30:23.998
Walter.

30:24.679 --> 30:27.124
According to this, Hughes'
baby wasn't entirely human.

30:27.481 --> 30:29.134
It explains his research--

30:29.717 --> 30:32.153
Reproductive biology
and gene replacement.

30:32.188 --> 30:34.512
<i>I hypothesize</i>
<i>that he may have used</i>

30:34.513 --> 30:36.156
some scorpion DNA--

30:36.157 --> 30:38.353
It's an incredibly
resilient creature--

30:38.354 --> 30:40.945
And also possibly something
that lives underground,

30:41.162 --> 30:42.464
a-a mole rat.

30:42.499 --> 30:44.332
Scorpions do paralyze
their prey with toxin.

30:44.333 --> 30:45.601
It could explain
the blue liquid.

30:45.636 --> 30:46.666
Hey, what did I miss?

30:46.969 --> 30:48.806
Hughes' baby--
he altered it inside the womb

30:48.846 --> 30:50.560
so that it could survive
its mother's lupus.

30:50.740 --> 30:53.242
- Okay. That is sick.
- <i>That is brilliant!</i>

30:53.443 --> 30:55.085
He's created
a super-baby--

30:55.879 --> 30:57.846
one capable of surviving

30:57.847 --> 31:00.202
in the most inhospitable
environment.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.473
Oh, Agent Dunham.
We've had a breakthrough.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.236
I heard.
Hughes' son.

31:08.659 --> 31:10.228
I think I might
know where he is.

31:10.528 --> 31:12.322
<i>When we were</i>
<i>at the Hughes' house,</i>

31:12.362 --> 31:15.132
I heard a noise,
like something breathing.

31:15.602 --> 31:17.335
I thought
that I had imagined it, but...

31:17.902 --> 31:18.806
I didn't.

31:21.039 --> 31:22.456
So if Hughes' son
is still alive,

31:22.508 --> 31:24.769
I think that he is
somewhere in that house...

31:24.843 --> 31:26.117
<i>Or near that house.</i>

31:26.118 --> 31:27.161
Or under it.

32:27.314 --> 32:28.276
Hello?

32:34.538 --> 32:36.026
Sheriff Golightly?

33:26.831 --> 33:27.587
<i>Peter.</i>

33:46.818 --> 33:47.604
Hey.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.601
<i>I think</i>
<i>it's a canine tooth.</i>

34:30.342 --> 34:31.466
Ugh.

34:31.576 --> 34:33.944
Confirmed. Dog.

34:45.766 --> 34:47.284
Gonna grab
a shovel.

35:25.316 --> 35:26.341
Peter?

35:27.204 --> 35:27.770
Yeah.

35:27.805 --> 35:30.017
Aah! Oh! Peter!

35:30.767 --> 35:32.101
Olivia!

35:32.102 --> 35:34.099
Oh! Oh!

35:34.780 --> 35:35.699
Olivia!

35:42.779 --> 35:44.569
Aah!

35:47.651 --> 35:49.885
Oh! Oh!

35:51.711 --> 35:52.845
Peter!

36:40.539 --> 36:43.007
He must have realized
that it was his son,

36:43.008 --> 36:46.320
because
we found traps set

36:46.355 --> 36:48.498
in all of these holes
that he'd dug

36:48.533 --> 36:49.647
all over his property.

36:51.850 --> 36:54.652
Could you imagine living
with a burden like that...

36:55.172 --> 36:56.854
when all you wanted
was a son?

37:01.108 --> 37:03.328
Charlie, what if
I don't want to remember?

37:04.980 --> 37:06.083
You mean your accident?

37:06.118 --> 37:07.347
All of it--

37:07.382 --> 37:08.500
Where I went,

37:09.191 --> 37:11.003
<i>who I met with,</i>
<i>what he told me.</i>

37:11.004 --> 37:13.626
I mean, what if there's
a part of my brain

37:13.661 --> 37:15.394
that's trying
to protect me?

37:16.610 --> 37:19.988
I'm just not sure you have
much of a choice here, Olivia.

37:20.023 --> 37:21.113
If Walter was correct

37:21.114 --> 37:23.550
about you going
to that other universe,

37:23.684 --> 37:25.578
<i>then whatever secrets</i>
<i>you learned</i>

37:25.613 --> 37:27.617
<i>might be worth</i>
<i>remembering.</i>

37:28.021 --> 37:30.026
Another universe.

37:33.972 --> 37:37.203
I never thought
that I would ever hear you

37:37.238 --> 37:39.966
utter those words
with a straight face.

37:41.386 --> 37:44.103
<i>You've come a long way,</i>
<i>Charlie Francis.</i>

37:45.740 --> 37:48.712
Well, you know,
whatever it is...

37:49.671 --> 37:51.172
We'll deal
with it together.

37:53.415 --> 37:54.751
<i>I'll help you remember.</i>

37:56.116 --> 37:57.199
I know you will.

38:07.395 --> 38:10.345
- Are you going fishing, son?
- Yes.

38:10.380 --> 38:11.490
But not alone.

38:11.533 --> 38:13.303
Oh, no?
Who with?

38:13.768 --> 38:17.277
Well, once upon a time,
there was a young man...

38:18.160 --> 38:20.677
probably around 10 or 11,

38:20.712 --> 38:21.875
who got it in his head

38:21.876 --> 38:23.644
that he wanted to take
his father fishing.

38:23.645 --> 38:27.012
So he saved up all the money
from his paper route

38:27.047 --> 38:30.593
and bought
a very special lure.

38:32.423 --> 38:33.584
Oh!

38:34.779 --> 38:37.627
It's called the Night
of Desirable Objects.

38:44.008 --> 38:45.422
Sadly, his father

38:45.457 --> 38:47.313
was never really
all that available to him,

38:47.348 --> 38:47.902
so...

38:49.177 --> 38:51.454
What started out
as a would-be bonding experience

38:51.489 --> 38:53.752
ended up with a young man
fishing alone in a boat.

38:54.689 --> 38:57.789
A-and this young man...

38:57.824 --> 38:59.246
gave this to you?

39:05.425 --> 39:06.413
Yes, Walter.

39:07.601 --> 39:08.695
Can I come...

39:09.628 --> 39:11.297
with you
and your friend?

39:12.902 --> 39:14.467
You know what, Walter?

39:15.079 --> 39:17.284
I think that
would make the trip.

39:19.004 --> 39:20.789
Good.

39:22.998 --> 39:23.738
Good.

41:03.699 --> 41:06.850
If you want to bowl,
we close in 15 minutes.

41:09.186 --> 41:11.224
No. Um...

41:12.402 --> 41:15.101
I'm looking for Sam Weiss.

41:15.745 --> 41:16.575
Is he here?

41:16.610 --> 41:17.971
Sam? No.

41:21.046 --> 41:22.738
Well, do you know
where I can find him?

41:22.773 --> 41:23.760
Atlanta, Georgia.

41:23.795 --> 41:26.605
He met a girl...
moved away.

41:29.423 --> 41:30.346
Oh.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.575
Thank you.

41:39.399 --> 41:40.654
That's it?

41:41.515 --> 41:42.686
Excuse me?

41:42.757 --> 41:44.391
You're giving up?

41:46.266 --> 41:47.808
I tell you he met a girl
and moved away,

41:47.843 --> 41:49.035
and you're just gonna
give up?

41:52.508 --> 41:53.939
You're Sam.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.985
<i>Nina Sharp</i>
<i>said you'd be coming by.</i>

42:02.311 --> 42:04.225
Have the headaches
started yet?

42:06.163 --> 42:06.936
No.

42:07.951 --> 42:09.432
They will.

42:12.089 --> 42:13.816
What are you,
a size 8?

42:44.444 --> 42:49.571
