NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.303 --> 00:06.932
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.132
In New York City,

00:08.208 --> 00:10.870
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.943 --> 00:14.744
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.814 --> 00:16.509
These are their stories,

00:18.218 --> 00:19.617
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

00:19.686 --> 00:21.085
You Iooking for somebody?

00:21.154 --> 00:26.319
Officer downstairs said
somebody in Special Victims
could help me.

00:26.393 --> 00:31.126
Who's catching?
Yo. That'd be me.
I'II call you back.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.131
Hi. I'm Detective Stabler.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.292
Rebecca Tolliver.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.928
Is there someplace
where we can speak privately?

00:38.004 --> 00:41.735
Of course.
How can I help you today?

00:42.675 --> 00:44.643
I need to report a rape.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.376
Right through here.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.411
I didn't know
how to handle this.

00:50.483 --> 00:54.647
You did the right thing
coming here. Have you been
to see a doctor yet?

00:55.255 --> 00:59.453
I wasn't attacked.
It's my daughter, Katie.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.492
What happened to Katie?
I'm not exactly sure.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.123
How do you know
she was raped?

01:07.200 --> 01:10.727
She started throwing up.
I took her to the doctor.
She's pregnant.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.833
Does Katie have a boyfriend?
No, never. No.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.300
How old is she?

01:19.813 --> 01:21.178
Twenty-two.

01:23.716 --> 01:29.052
Ms. Tolliver, your daughter
is an adult. If she were
raped, she needs to report it.

01:29.556 --> 01:32.354
Talk to her. She's waiting
in the hallway.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.105
Hi, Katie.
I'm Detective Stabler.

01:50.543 --> 01:52.773
How do you introduce yourself?

01:58.251 --> 01:59.582
I'm Katie.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.748
It's nice to meet you, Katie.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.134
BENSON: So, Katie, your mom
says that she took you
to the doctor.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.939
I don't feel good.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.536
What happens
when you don't feel good?

03:00.613 --> 03:02.171
I throw up.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.309
How come you're throwing up?

03:05.385 --> 03:08.183
'Cause the doctor says
I got a baby in me.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.246
But there's no daddy.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.788
Babies need a mommy
and a daddy.

03:14.627 --> 03:17.790
Could I have a glass of water?
Sure.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.192
Is Katie's father
still in the picture?

03:23.336 --> 03:25.668
He Ieft us
after Katie was born.

03:28.408 --> 03:33.471
Can you think of anyone
who's shown any undue
interest in Katie recently?

03:33.546 --> 03:35.673
No, but she's away
from me all day Iong.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.774
I have to work,
so Katie goes
to a day program,

03:38.851 --> 03:41.479
and she has a part-time job
three afternoons a week.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.580
It would be easy for someone
to take advantage of her.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.353
Ms. Tolliver, have you
discussed sex with Katie?

03:47.427 --> 03:51.386
She has the mind of a child.
She'd never understand.

03:51.864 --> 03:54.765
Could I hear
what they're saying?
Of course.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.331
Katie, do you know
where babies come from?

03:59.172 --> 04:01.037
It's... It's private.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.473
It's okay. You can tell me.
We're both girls.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.603
My mom will be mad.

04:06.679 --> 04:10.410
No, she won't.
I talked to her.
She said that it was okay.

04:15.121 --> 04:18.716
Babies come from sex.
Mmm-hmm.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.357
Do you know
what sex is, Katie?

04:23.997 --> 04:28.195
A mommy and daddy kiss
and hold hands.
Mmm-hmm.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.301
Do you kiss and hold hands
with anybody?

04:36.175 --> 04:38.871
It's okay. You can tell me.
It'II be our secret.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.177
I'm gonna throw up.

04:45.918 --> 04:48.284
Okay. Come on.
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.117
I have to help her.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.486
Ms. Tolliver,
Detective Stabler's gonna need

04:52.558 --> 04:54.890
whatever information
you can give him
for his report.

04:54.961 --> 05:00.490
After I check on Katie. I want
you to find the son of a bitch
that did this to us!

05:02.869 --> 05:04.393
Did this to us?

05:05.505 --> 05:09.566
Woman spent her Iife taking
care of a special needs child
who's now an adult.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.269
Her nest will never be empty.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.368
Look, I'm very sympathetic,

05:12.445 --> 05:15.903
but we might have more to
work with had she taught
Katie about the facts of Iife.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.008
And until Katie knows them,
she's not gonna be able
to tell us who raped her.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.883
We educate her, she testifies,
jury thinks we coached her.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.013
Maybe we should
call the shrink
to evaluate her.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.148
I'II call Huang.

05:25.224 --> 05:29.354
In the meantime, Iet's check
with Katie's doctor. See if
he gave her a pelvic exam.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.159
Then I wanna nail down
her daily routine.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.860
Ms. Tolliver, this is our
department psychiatrist,
Dr. George Huang.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.962
How many people
do we have to talk to?

05:40.039 --> 05:41.904
Ma'am, I'd just Iike
a few minutes
with your daughter

05:41.974 --> 05:44.374
to explore her comprehension
of what happened to her.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.934
Can't this wait till tomorrow?

05:46.012 --> 05:48.503
Ma'am, the more the time
passes, the Iess chance
we have of catching...

05:48.581 --> 05:51.948
I just can't put her through
any more now, Detective.

05:52.785 --> 05:55.083
Come on, Katie,
we're going home.

05:57.957 --> 06:01.256
She thinks
you just file a complaint,
we do the rest.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.390
Just means we got to find
another way in.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.487
What do we got so far?

06:04.564 --> 06:06.998
Well, Katie's doctor
confirms the pregnancy.

06:07.066 --> 06:08.226
Said she had sex repeatedly,

06:08.301 --> 06:09.893
but there's no way to tell
whether it was forcible.

06:09.969 --> 06:12.301
She goes to a day center
in Murray Hill
five days a week,

06:12.372 --> 06:15.273
and she works at
a nearby grocery Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Fridays.

06:15.341 --> 06:16.808
Fin and Munch will check out
the grocery store.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.173
You two hit the day center.
Okay.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.678
Katie would have been
tested for placement
in the appropriate classes.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.875
If you can get the results,
I'II have a better idea
of her abilities.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.886
LUCAS: Katie's IQ
is around 55.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.782
It's borderline between
mild and moderate
mental retardation.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.189
Her mother
kept her home today.
How's she doing?

06:38.264 --> 06:41.165
She's confused.
She doesn't understand
what's happening to her.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.896
Yeah, she'd understand more
if her mother Iet her
out of the cocoon.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.200
Parent's first instinct
is to protect their children.

06:46.272 --> 06:49.503
Rebecca Tolliver
is overprotective.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.975
Doesn't think
Katie can function
in the world without her.

06:52.044 --> 06:54.478
And you disagree.
Yes, I do.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.606
And what does Katie do
when she's here?

06:56.682 --> 06:59.150
Art and music therapy,
Iife skills training.

06:59.218 --> 07:03.245
We also teach
independent Iiving,
dating and sex education,

07:03.322 --> 07:05.620
but Katie's mother
won't Iet her
take any of those.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.852
How carefully do you screen
your employees?

07:07.927 --> 07:11.488
Background checks, references.
We've never had a problem.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.763
Katie have any friends
we can talk to?

07:13.833 --> 07:17.667
Her best friend
is Danny Jordan. He's
one of our success stories.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.331
STABLER: Any chance
they're more than friends?

07:20.773 --> 07:24.038
We supervise our clients
very closely.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.601
Nobody here has ever reported
Danny touching Katie.

07:26.679 --> 07:29.580
And he's taken
our dating class and sex ed.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.875
I know what sex is.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.816
STABLER:
Did you ever tell Katie?

07:34.220 --> 07:35.244
No.

07:35.688 --> 07:36.950
How come?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.982
She has to Iearn about it
in school first. That's...

07:40.059 --> 07:42.152
That's what our teacher said.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.059
You and Katie ever have sex?

07:45.565 --> 07:46.589
No.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.535
She ever tell you
if someone was bothering her?

07:52.872 --> 07:54.863
I promised I wouldn't say.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.909
Danny, you know
I'm a police officer?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.370
And I'm here because
we think someone's
been bothering Katie.

08:00.446 --> 08:04.007
Now, if you know who it is,
you got to tell me
so that I can help her.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.282
It's okay, Danny.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.553
Ray, the bus driver.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.661
Your bus driver?

08:21.734 --> 08:25.135
I take the real bus.
Katie, she takes
the Iittle bus.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.672
Van brings Katie here,
to work and then home.

08:27.773 --> 08:30.139
And what did Katie say
about this bus driver?

08:31.143 --> 08:32.770
He's mean to her.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.743
What'd he do to her?

08:37.482 --> 08:39.451
He took things from her.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.614
What else did he do to Katie?

08:46.125 --> 08:47.649
He touched her.

08:48.461 --> 08:52.420
Katie comes in one day,
she's crying. Says her
bus driver pushed her.

08:52.498 --> 08:56.332
I went outside and told
the bastard I'd get him fired
if I heard it happened again.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.768
Anyone in the store
give Katie a hard time?

08:58.838 --> 09:02.706
Last month. I fired
the frozen foods manager
for calling her an imbecile.

09:02.775 --> 09:03.901
That happen a Iot?

09:03.976 --> 09:06.945
Except for the occasional
ignorant customer,
almost never.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.914
I'm on the board at the day
center. I don't tolerate
that kind of abuse.

09:09.982 --> 09:13.884
What does she do around here?
Stocks shelves,
bags groceries, sweeps up.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.853
Day center sends me
a couple of people every year.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.514
Must be cheap Iabor.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.718
They make union wages,
Detective, and Iearn how
to Iive in the real world.

09:20.793 --> 09:23.284
I get employees
who don't complain,
don't Ieave

09:23.362 --> 09:25.922
and work harder
than some people
who aren't disabled.

09:25.998 --> 09:28.933
Besides the bus driver,
Katie ever mention
anybody outside the store

09:29.001 --> 09:30.263
that gave her trouble?

09:30.336 --> 09:33.794
No. I figured the only reason
she told me about it was
because it had just happened.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.704
She was really upset.

09:36.475 --> 09:38.943
We can't arrest the bus driver
until Katie tells us
what he did.

09:39.011 --> 09:41.536
EIIiot's got the mother
on the phone now to see
if we can talk to Katie.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.104
What have we got on this guy?

09:43.182 --> 09:45.707
Ray Dunstan, he's 52.
He's got no rap sheet.

09:45.785 --> 09:49.186
But the nursing home where
he worked out in GIen Cove
fired him Iast year

09:49.255 --> 09:51.280
for allegedly stealing
from the residents.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.585
Why wasn't he arrested?

09:52.658 --> 09:55.354
Dunstan claims
that the old folks
gave him gifts.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.829
He picks the ones
with dementia.
Cops couldn't prove otherwise.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.559
We're all set for tomorrow.

10:00.633 --> 10:04.194
BENSON: What did you have
to promise her?
A trip to the zoo.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.768
(SEALS BARKING)

10:08.941 --> 10:10.340
(LAUGHING)

10:13.746 --> 10:15.304
Hi, Katie.

10:15.381 --> 10:18.612
Hi, OIivia. Hey, EIIiot.
Hey, Katie.

10:18.684 --> 10:22.677
Katie, this is AIex.
The three of us are gonna
talk together, okay?

10:22.755 --> 10:26.088
I'II be right over there.
Okay.

10:29.228 --> 10:32.288
BENSON: Katie, we just want
to ask you a few questions.

10:35.568 --> 10:40.062
This is Katie's
favorite place.
She Ioves the animals.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.902
So do my twins.

10:42.775 --> 10:46.768
How old are they?
Eight. I have
a boy and a girl.

10:50.616 --> 10:54.780
When I found out I was
pregnant, I dreamed of
graduation, a wedding,

10:54.854 --> 10:58.915
someone to take care of me
when I got old,
even grandchildren.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.353
I'm 67.

11:03.963 --> 11:07.126
I just can't handle

11:07.199 --> 11:10.191
taking care of two completely
dependent children.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.064
(BIRD CAWING)

11:12.872 --> 11:17.605
Well, the director at Katie's
day center says that
she has a Iot of potential.

11:17.910 --> 11:21.107
Scott Lucas thinks
you can teach
anybody anything.

11:21.981 --> 11:26.543
I Iet Katie out in the world.
Look what happened.

11:27.653 --> 11:31.555
So, Katie, what do you say
when you don't want
to do something?

11:31.757 --> 11:33.019
I say "no"'

11:33.192 --> 11:35.660
And can you say "no"
to your mama?

11:35.728 --> 11:38.424
I'm not allowed.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.624
What about to your teachers?

11:40.700 --> 11:41.689
Uh-uh.

11:42.635 --> 11:45.365
Can you say it
to your bus driver, Katie?

11:46.972 --> 11:50.066
I don't want
to talk about him.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.609
Why not?

11:51.677 --> 11:53.907
Something will happen to Mama.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.380
I promise you nothing bad
is gonna happen to Mama

11:58.451 --> 12:00.817
if you tell us
what the bus driver did.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.085
He took my necklace.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.756
What did it Iook Iike?

12:07.993 --> 12:11.656
A heart with a picture
of Mama inside.

12:11.931 --> 12:13.592
Did you tell Mama?

12:14.533 --> 12:16.330
I told her I Iost it.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.566
How come?

12:19.772 --> 12:23.003
Ray said he'II hurt us
if I tell.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.910
Katie, has Ray hurt you?

12:30.216 --> 12:31.706
He pinches me.

We can stop.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.772
KATIE: Mama!

12:59.211 --> 13:00.337
What happened?

13:00.412 --> 13:02.243
I don't want to talk anymore.

13:02.314 --> 13:05.010
You promised not to upset her.

13:05.084 --> 13:09.350
She was very helpful.
Good. We are gonna
go home now.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.025
How'd she do?

13:15.094 --> 13:17.187
We didn't get enough to prove
the bus driver raped her,

13:17.263 --> 13:20.357
but we did get plenty
to get a search warrant
for his apartment.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.397
What a dump.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.635
When I was a kid, I wanted
to be a bus driver
just Iike Ralph Kramden.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.801
Even The Honeymooners
Iived better than this.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.277
You don't Iive
much better than this now.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.582
Find this garbage
furniture in the street?

13:38.651 --> 13:41.950
Whoa! Look what I found.

13:43.289 --> 13:47.783
He didn't even try to hide it.
When these perps gonna
get some imagination?

13:49.028 --> 13:53.522
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Let's go. Let's go.
I'm Iate for Oprah,

13:53.599 --> 13:55.328
Ray Dunstan?
Yeah?

13:55.401 --> 13:57.028
Police. Turn around.
Put your hands on the bus.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.333
What'd I do?
This is brutality!

14:00.406 --> 14:04.638
Ray, when a cop tells you
to do something,
you should just do it.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.913
We're going for
a Iittle ride. Let's go.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.718
Bus company's gonna fire me
for Ieaving that van
on the street.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.450
They're gonna fire you anyway
for robbing their passengers.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.220
Which one of the retards
told you that?

14:21.727 --> 14:26.494
You don't want to use
that word around me again,
okay? Are we connecting?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.160
I didn't steal nothing
from nobody.
Really?

14:30.636 --> 14:33.332
Then what was
Katie Tolliver's necklace
doing in your apartment?

14:33.405 --> 14:34.394
It was a gift.

14:34.473 --> 14:37.101
Like the gifts you got
from the patients
at the nursing home?

14:37.176 --> 14:38.165
That's right.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.839
Yeah. You're just such
a nice guy, everybody
wants to give you gifts.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.472
Katie says you stole it.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.518
Hey, my word
against a moron's.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.048
It slipped out.

14:49.121 --> 14:52.022
Hey! You can't do that.

14:52.658 --> 14:53.750
It just slipped out.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.488
Jury's not gonna have
a whole Iot of sympathy
for a perv

14:56.562 --> 14:59.258
who takes advantage
of mentally challenged women.

14:59.331 --> 15:01.231
Who you calling a perv?

15:02.001 --> 15:04.697
Katie says that you
touched her breast.

15:04.803 --> 15:07.795
Maybe helping her in and out
of the van, but I never
went near any of them.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.932
Well, then how'd you
get her pregnant?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.336
(LAUGHING)

15:15.514 --> 15:17.482
You think rape is funny?

15:18.350 --> 15:21.046
She's got one in the oven,
it sure as hell ain't mine.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.520
We'II find out
as soon as we compare
your DNA to the baby's.

15:23.589 --> 15:27.958
You don't need to. After I
knocked up my ex-wife twice,
I got a vasectomy.

15:28.027 --> 15:29.824
I'm shooting blanks.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.528
Dunstan released
his medical records.
Guy may be a dirtbag,

15:35.601 --> 15:37.796
but he's telling the truth.
Operation was two years ago.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.394
We're booking him
for petty Iarceny.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.962
We'II up it to robbery three
if we can prove force.

15:42.041 --> 15:46.068
Which Ieaves us
no closer to finding
Katie's rapist. Anything?

15:46.145 --> 15:49.273
State Office of Mental
Retardation investigated
Katie's day center Iast year.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.372
BENSON: What for?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.748
Anonymous phone complaint.
Caller said something
bad was going down.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.754
Super sleuths
couldn't get anybody to talk,
and it went nowhere.

15:56.822 --> 16:00.383
The day the investigation
started, an instructor
named Joe Parker quit.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.859
MUNCH: Coincidence?
Go find out.

16:06.265 --> 16:08.233
PARKER: I Ieft because
I got a better job.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.860
And you just happened to pick
a day the State starts
an investigation?

16:10.936 --> 16:12.301
I had to start here
right away.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.805
That's why you gave
five minutes notice
you were Ieaving?

16:14.873 --> 16:18.240
Look, I have nothing
but great things to say
about the day center.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.244
I have to get back
to my students.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.041
Why'd you call the state, Joe?

16:22.114 --> 16:25.106
It wasn't me.
Yeah, it was.
Remember, anonymous tip?

16:25.184 --> 16:26.811
(ON RADIO)
Yeah, it's the truth,

16:26.885 --> 16:29.911
Someone's abusing clients
in the Manhattan
Adult Day Center,

16:29.989 --> 16:32.048
FIN: Sounds Iike you, Joe.

16:32.124 --> 16:35.560
I made the call, okay?
That's all I'm saying.

16:35.627 --> 16:36.855
If you're covering
anything up...

16:36.929 --> 16:40.956
They're the ones covering up.
I quit because of Scott Lucas.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.998
The center director?
What'd he do?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.865
He got
one of the clients pregnant.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.635
If you're innocent,
why the hell
didn't you tell us?

16:50.709 --> 16:53.576
I know how this Iooks.
Really bad. Start talking.

16:54.246 --> 16:57.511
It's all true,
except for my involvement.

17:01.987 --> 17:05.423
Last year, one of our
17-year-old clients
turned up pregnant.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.356
She was so scared,
she blamed it on me.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.656
Did you do it?
Of course not.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.592
One of our male clients
admitted that he was
the father.

17:12.664 --> 17:15.326
I asked for a DNA study
to confirm it.
The baby was his.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.766
Nobody went to the police.

17:16.835 --> 17:19.234
I thought we could
handle it internally.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.464
We started the dating classes
so this wouldn't happen again.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.973
Well, history has a way
of repeating itself,
doesn't it?

17:24.042 --> 17:26.307
It's because Katie
and others Iike her
have the minds of children,

17:26.377 --> 17:30.007
but they Iive in adult bodies,
complete with hormones.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.572
This could easily happen again

17:31.650 --> 17:34.778
unless Katie's mother
stops sheltering her
from reality.

17:38.323 --> 17:39.312
(EXHALES)

17:39.658 --> 17:41.023
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

17:41.226 --> 17:43.456
He's not wrong
about Katie's mother.

17:43.529 --> 17:46.225
If I were in her shoes,
I don't know
I'd react any differently.

17:46.298 --> 17:50.667
You'd want to find your
child's rapist. She's got
to Iet Huang talk to Katie.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.966
I'm gonna take
another shot at her.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.334
Absolutely not.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.500
You said you wanted
to find out who did this.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.841
Without having to put Katie
through this again.
She's too fragile.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.440
Ms. Tolliver, with all
due respect, who are you
trying to protect here?

18:06.785 --> 18:09.015
If you're saying
that this is about my guilt...

18:09.088 --> 18:12.387
I am not saying
it's your fault
that Katie was raped.

18:14.626 --> 18:18.619
Everything bad
that's happened to Katie
and to me, it's my fault.

18:18.964 --> 18:24.231
Because 22 years ago
I chose to have a child
with Down syndrome

18:24.303 --> 18:29.104
rather than to have
an abortion, and it
destroyed my marriage.

18:32.578 --> 18:37.174
She's my whole Iife,
and I have to protect her.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.080
Then make sure
this doesn't happen
to her again.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.711
Let us talk to her
at the day center.

18:42.688 --> 18:46.784
We'II make it so she's
comfortable, she's familiar
with the surroundings.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.519
Our Assistant
District Attorney will
be there to talk to her,

18:49.595 --> 18:52.621
so Katie doesn't have to
keep repeating herself
over and over.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.994
PIease.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.502
Katie, what do you call this?
Ear.

19:07.846 --> 19:11.179
And what do you call this?
Arm.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.141
How about this?

19:14.119 --> 19:15.211
Boob.

19:17.222 --> 19:20.385
Very good, Katie.
You know all your body parts.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.258
Thank you.

19:23.328 --> 19:27.162
Now I want to talk
about your friends.
Who's your best friend?

19:28.300 --> 19:29.460
Danny.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.567
And what do you and Danny
do together?

19:33.138 --> 19:35.231
Talk. We eat Iunch.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.271
What else do you do?

19:40.579 --> 19:42.046
It's private.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.776
HUANG: Do you and Danny
touch each other?

19:46.785 --> 19:47.911
Yeah.

19:48.921 --> 19:52.652
AIex, could you stand up,
please? Thanks.

19:54.059 --> 19:57.620
Katie, could you just point
to where you and Danny touch?

19:58.997 --> 20:00.328
Like this.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.091
Anywhere else?

20:08.974 --> 20:10.202
We kiss.

20:13.178 --> 20:15.772
Does Danny touch you
in your private parts?

20:17.950 --> 20:18.939
No.

20:23.455 --> 20:26.652
I got my baby from Danny.

20:28.694 --> 20:29.752
How?

20:31.763 --> 20:36.223
Kissing, stupid. Your friend
doesn't know anything.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.533
Danny's the father?

20:41.607 --> 20:44.371
Katie says he's her boyfriend.
It's possible.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.775
But she still
has no comprehension
of how she got pregnant.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.142
How could you Iet this happen?

20:48.213 --> 20:51.239
We both know how closely
Katie is supervised.
It didn't happen here.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.250
But they're not together
anyplace else.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.582
Aren't you going
to have him arrested?

20:55.654 --> 20:58.680
Katie's uncorroborated
statement isn't enough
because of her disability.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.624
And we can't do
a paternity test
until the baby's born.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.025
We're terminating
the pregnancy.

21:04.496 --> 21:06.726
When?
Tomorrow.
We have an appointment.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.289
Does Katie know?
I was going
to tell her tonight.

21:09.368 --> 21:12.201
Tell her? Where's her say
in this decision?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.672
Her baby has a 50-50 chance
of having Down syndrome.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.538
Who's going to take care
of them when I'm gone?

21:17.609 --> 21:20.271
Katie is, with all the support
we can provide her.

21:20.345 --> 21:25.009
No. I am not having Katie
going through what I have.

21:26.184 --> 21:28.482
She can't keep this baby.
Why?

21:29.521 --> 21:31.455
Why what, sweetie?

21:32.190 --> 21:34.420
Why can't I have my baby?

21:35.794 --> 21:36.988
Katie,

21:38.964 --> 21:41.125
I can't take care
of both of you.

21:41.199 --> 21:43.099
Why can't I be a mommy?

21:44.770 --> 21:47.000
We're not gonna
have this conversation now.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.805
Here. Here's the address.

21:51.877 --> 21:55.074
You meet us there,
and you'II get
your DNA sample.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.983
I want my baby.

22:00.652 --> 22:04.213
Mommy, please
don't take away my baby.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.227
We'II be ready for Katie
in a few minutes.

22:11.296 --> 22:13.594
Is it gonna hurt?
No, Katie, it won't hurt.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.633
You'II be asleep, honey.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.135
Mom says I snore.

22:18.437 --> 22:19.768
Thank you.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.903
Detective Benson.

22:22.974 --> 22:26.466
This is a subpoena for
the tissue sample from
the products of conception.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.343
We'II bring it to you
after the procedure.
Thank you.

22:34.586 --> 22:35.746
(DOOR OPENS)

22:37.756 --> 22:38.848
KATIE: Hi, Scott.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.188
What the hell
are you doing here?

22:42.160 --> 22:45.220
Mr. Lucas has obtained
an injunction
to stop the abortion

22:45.297 --> 22:46.924
pending the outcome
of a hearing.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.795
What kind of hearing?

22:48.934 --> 22:50.526
Guardianship of your daughter.

22:50.602 --> 22:53.833
Katie has the right to decide
whether or not
to keep her baby.

22:53.905 --> 22:56.703
She is not capable
of making that decision.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.947
If the court finds Katie
competent to care
for her child,

23:08.019 --> 23:10.852
her rapist's defense Iawyer
is going to argue
that she was competent enough

23:10.922 --> 23:12.685
to consent to sex.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.419
She doesn't even know
where that baby came from.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.256
It doesn't matter.
Once she's found competent,

23:16.328 --> 23:19.229
all the defense
is going to focus on
is that she never said "no"'

23:19.297 --> 23:21.629
So the case is Iost
before we've
collared the rapist?

23:21.700 --> 23:24.794
If it's a rape. Are we sure
it's not the boyfriend?

23:24.870 --> 23:26.861
Munch and Fin talked to him,
but no matter what he says,

23:26.938 --> 23:29.930
we can't check
the story without DNA.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.838
How many weeks
is Katie into her pregnancy?

23:32.911 --> 23:34.173
Ten.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.077
Too early for amniocentesis.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.810
But not for a CVS test.
In English, please.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.408
Chorionic villus sampling.

23:40.485 --> 23:42.976
We take some tissue
from the placenta Iining
to get the baby's DNA.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.919
We did one for another case
about a year ago.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.821
How are we gonna get
Katie's mother to go for it?

23:46.892 --> 23:50.692
Tell her she can find out
whether her grandchild
has Down syndrome.

23:51.997 --> 23:53.589
You wanna ask Rebecca,
or should I?

23:53.665 --> 23:56.566
Whoever she's Iess pissed at.
What's wrong?

23:57.502 --> 23:59.629
Your captain said
that you were on the way over.

23:59.704 --> 24:00.762
Is Katie okay?

24:00.839 --> 24:03.899
She's supposed
to be at school,
and she never got there.

24:04.543 --> 24:06.704
Where's Danny?
Day center said
he's a no-show.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.143
Called in sick this morning.

24:08.213 --> 24:09.271
How much we know about him?

24:09.347 --> 24:11.645
He shares
an independent Iiving
apartment in the East Village.

24:11.716 --> 24:13.149
Parents Iive up in Riverdale.

24:13.218 --> 24:14.617
OIivia's on the phone
with them right now.

24:14.686 --> 24:16.881
What did we get
from Katie's mother?

24:16.955 --> 24:19.219
Anger, blame, but nothing
that's gonna help us.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.191
You know, Danny's been
on his own for a while.

24:21.259 --> 24:22.590
He may be thinking
for the both of them.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.026
If Danny thinks
he's the baby's father,

24:24.095 --> 24:26.188
makes sense they'd run
to prevent an abortion.

24:26.264 --> 24:28.357
Even if he's not the father,
makes sense he'd help her.

24:28.433 --> 24:32.301
Two innocents alone in
the big city. They're gonna
need shelter, money for food.

24:32.370 --> 24:33.803
Danny's parents
haven't heard from him.

24:33.872 --> 24:38.104
But they had an apartment
at 73rd and Amsterdam,
where Danny grew up.

24:38.176 --> 24:40.974
They're on the run,
first place they're gonna
go is somewhere familiar.

24:41.046 --> 24:44.311
Well, the parents said that
Danny Iives with a roommate
named Andy McCollum.

24:44.382 --> 24:46.509
We'II just pay Andy a visit.

24:46.718 --> 24:50.347
Danny didn't tell me
where he went. We don't
answer to each other.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.855
Did he stay here Iast night?

24:51.923 --> 24:53.015
Yeah.

24:53.592 --> 24:55.992
When's the Iast time
you saw him?
Earlier.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.790
Help us out here. We think
he ran away with a girl.

24:57.863 --> 24:58.852
It's a free country.

24:58.930 --> 25:01.125
She's got Down syndrome.
We need to know where she is.

25:01.199 --> 25:04.930
So her mother
can abort her baby?
Danny told me all about it.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.493
Come on,
Andy with the attitude.

25:06.571 --> 25:09.267
We're just trying to make sure
both of them are safe.

25:09.341 --> 25:13.072
They were here this morning.
Danny took some clothes
and they Ieft.

25:13.144 --> 25:14.873
He say where
they were going?

25:14.946 --> 25:16.538
No, just asked to
borrow some money.

25:16.615 --> 25:17.639
MUNCH: Did you give him any?

25:17.716 --> 25:20.879
I didn't have any cash,
so I gave him my ATM card.

25:20.952 --> 25:23.011
You make that a habit?
He could clean you out.

25:23.088 --> 25:26.580
He won't.
If you can't trust Danny,
you can't trust anyone.

25:29.494 --> 25:31.121
So Danny came back
to the old neighborhood.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.458
Home is where the heart is.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.625
He used his roommate's
ATM card right here this
morning, took out 200 bucks.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.725
You can barely eat dinner
around here for $200.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.531
Well, a couple Iike that's
got to stand out.

25:39.604 --> 25:42.198
If they spent the money
around here, somebody's
gonna remember them.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.263
Where do we start?

25:43.341 --> 25:44.535
Danny Iived
two blocks from here.

25:44.609 --> 25:46.304
You guys take Broadway.
We'II take Amsterdam.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.709
AII right.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.679
MAN: Yeah. They were here.

25:52.751 --> 25:55.914
Sweet. Came up to the counter
holding hands.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.545
When?
This morning.

25:57.622 --> 26:00.489
What'd they want?
The girl said
she'd been throwing up.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.821
You give her anything?

26:01.893 --> 26:04.691
Nothing over the counter
because she said
she's pregnant.

26:04.763 --> 26:08.426
I told them to hit a
grocery store. Ginger ale's
as good as anything.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.960
Yeah. Yeah, they came in
just before the Iunch rush.
They must have a newborn.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.602
What makes you say that?

26:14.673 --> 26:18.666
They just about cleaned me out
of disposable diapers,
infant size.

26:18.777 --> 26:22.543
AIso, they bought some
ginger ale. Her husband
said she was puking.

26:22.614 --> 26:25.481
When they Ieft,
did you happen to notice
which direction they headed?

26:25.550 --> 26:29.418
I can do better than that.
Girl said she needed a job,

26:29.487 --> 26:32.650
said she had experience
working in a supermarket.

26:33.191 --> 26:37.958
I could tell she was slow,
but stocking shelves
ain't rocket science.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.422
Yeah. The husband filled out
the application.

26:47.238 --> 26:48.535
Smells awful good in here,
Katie.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.699
What are you cooking?

26:49.774 --> 26:50.866
Soup.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.672
Soup. Your mom teach you
how to cook?

26:53.878 --> 26:58.042
Mom says I can't,
but Danny taught me.

26:58.316 --> 27:01.843
KATIE: You want some
chocolate milk?
Yeah. Sure. Thanks.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.046
(DOOR CLOSES)

27:04.723 --> 27:06.190
Danny's home.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.686
What do you want?

27:10.128 --> 27:13.655
We need to talk
to you and Katie.
You can't take our baby.

27:13.732 --> 27:14.960
That's not why we're here.

27:15.033 --> 27:17.365
Katie, your mom wants
you to come home.

27:17.435 --> 27:20.199
DANNY: This is our new home.
This is my bed.

27:24.009 --> 27:25.499
And this is Danny's.

27:27.545 --> 27:29.410
We're getting married.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.842
First, we're all gonna go
for a ride down to our office.

27:35.854 --> 27:36.946
Okay.

27:37.922 --> 27:39.389
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

27:42.027 --> 27:44.325
Oh, I was so worried
about you.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.920
I'm okay, Mama.

27:47.432 --> 27:48.797
She's okay.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.297
What did you do to her?

27:50.368 --> 27:53.428
I didn't hurt Katie.
I Iove her and she Ioves me.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.798
He kidnapped and raped her.

27:54.873 --> 27:55.965
Katie went willingly.

27:56.041 --> 28:00.944
I didn't have sex with Katie.
Today, I told Katie what the
teacher said about sex,

28:01.012 --> 28:03.037
and she didn't believe me.

28:04.549 --> 28:06.949
What did Katie say
when you told her
what sex was?

28:07.018 --> 28:11.284
She said, "That's not sex.
That's exercise"'

28:16.027 --> 28:18.552
So, Katie, tell me
how you exercise.

28:19.464 --> 28:23.127
You pull your pants down,
and you sit on someone's Iap.

28:23.802 --> 28:25.633
And who taught you that?

28:26.304 --> 28:28.033
It's a secret.

28:28.907 --> 28:32.206
It's all right, honey.
You can tell me and OIivia.

28:34.779 --> 28:39.216
Then he won't give me anymore
ice cream or candy.

28:40.418 --> 28:41.749
Who won't?

28:44.022 --> 28:48.322
Sweetheart,
this is really important.
PIease tell Mama.

28:52.931 --> 28:54.762
Mr. Cheney.

28:57.702 --> 29:00.034
Your boss
at the grocery store?

29:02.807 --> 29:05.037
And do you exercise
with Mr. Cheney?

29:05.110 --> 29:06.771
Every day at work.

29:08.313 --> 29:11.305
And does Mr. Cheney
pull his pants down, too?

29:14.619 --> 29:15.608
It hurt.

29:18.823 --> 29:24.193
Mr. Cheney said
it would stop hurting
when I could do it better.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.533
I try to help Katie,
and this is the thanks I get?

29:37.609 --> 29:40.840
Yeah, she told us all about
your exercise classes,
doing push-ups on your Iap.

29:40.912 --> 29:44.211
The only exercise Katie and I
ever did was task repetition.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.217
That's how you train
disabled people to function
in a work environment.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.277
Dropping your pants
is part of the curriculum?

29:50.588 --> 29:53.421
People Iike Katie
can't distinguish
reality from fantasy.

29:53.491 --> 29:55.083
I don't' know where
she's getting this from.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.526
She got it from you, Abe.
Same place she got her baby.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.860
What?
Yeah. She's carrying
your Iove child.

30:01.399 --> 30:02.889
That's ridiculous.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.696
Good, then we can
clear this right up.

30:04.769 --> 30:05.895
Just tell me how.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.598
You supply us
with a DNA sample,
we compare it to the baby's,

30:08.673 --> 30:11.506
and this is all over
with our sincerest apology.

30:13.044 --> 30:15.035
Apologize to my attorney.

30:18.883 --> 30:19.872
Cheney cave?

30:19.951 --> 30:22.476
The second we said the word
"pregnancy" he Iawyered up.

30:22.554 --> 30:25.148
Katie's mother is taking her
for the chorionic villus test.

30:25.223 --> 30:29.717
When you get the tissue
sample, call me. I'II get
a warrant for Cheney's DNA.

30:29.794 --> 30:31.785
MAN: AIexandra Cabot?
Yes.

30:31.863 --> 30:33.091
For you.

30:34.032 --> 30:35.932
I'm being served.
For what?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.729
I just deliver them.

30:38.236 --> 30:42.502
AIex, Huang just called.
He got served with a subpoena
and wanted to warn you.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.405
You're about 10 seconds
too Iate.

30:44.475 --> 30:45.874
What's it say?

30:46.077 --> 30:48.705
Scott Lucas's attorney
is calling on Huang and I
to testify

30:48.780 --> 30:50.941
that Katie is competent
to keep her baby.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.277
Why you and not us?

30:52.350 --> 30:55.478
Lucas knows I was
in the room with Huang
when he evaluated Katie.

30:55.553 --> 30:59.785
He wants the judge to hear
from an attorney and a shrink
that Katie is competent.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.395
It's no problem.

31:05.530 --> 31:09.091
This clearly compromises
the integrity of an ongoing
criminal investigation.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.567
I'II make the subpoena
go away.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.332
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

31:14.405 --> 31:16.873
It is if you want to take
Katie Tolliver's rapist
to trial.

31:16.941 --> 31:19.569
Katie's mother wants her
to abort the baby.

31:19.644 --> 31:21.976
Maybe that is something
Katie should decide
for herself.

31:22.046 --> 31:25.675
You want to be a crusader
for victims' rights,
go work for Social Services.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.048
Your job is to
prosecute crime.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.548
Katie has already
been victimized once.

31:30.622 --> 31:33.489
My testimony can prevent her
from being victimized
a second time.

31:33.558 --> 31:37.824
You represent the People
of the State of New York,
not Katie Tolliver.

31:38.129 --> 31:40.996
Whether Katie gets to keep
her baby is between her
and her mother.

31:41.065 --> 31:44.865
I do have a duty
to the victim.
To convict her rapist.

31:44.936 --> 31:47.632
She's found competent,
you're going to Iose.

31:47.805 --> 31:51.297
Cheney's Iawyer will get her
to say she knew what she
was doing, that she Iiked it.

31:51.376 --> 31:55.574
He'II destroy her
on the stand.
Don't Iet this happen.

31:57.949 --> 32:00.383
You're jeopardizing
the rape case.

32:00.785 --> 32:06.121
Oh, no, you are.
You and Scott Lucas.
You should be talking to him.

32:08.359 --> 32:10.350
Lucas will drop his challenge
to your guardianship

32:10.428 --> 32:13.295
if you agree not to terminate
Katie's pregnancy.

32:14.766 --> 32:19.863
I can't do that.
Katie needs this abortion
and to have her tubes tied

32:19.938 --> 32:21.735
so that this
doesn't happen again.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.797
What about what Katie wants?

32:23.875 --> 32:28.039
I know that you think
I'm cruel, Miss Cabot,
but I Iove my daughter.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.810
Maybe I should have Iet Katie
take sex education,

32:31.883 --> 32:34.374
but I knew
she couldn't understand.

32:35.353 --> 32:38.083
Why do you need Katie
to be so dependent?

32:41.592 --> 32:46.086
I have sacrificed everything
to be a good mother.

32:46.164 --> 32:49.099
Including Katie's right
to Iead her own Iife.

33:03.181 --> 33:07.277
Our detectives found Katie
Tolliver and her boyfriend
Danny Jordan in a hotel.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.949
They were preparing
for Katie's baby.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.454
CALDWELL: Do you know how
they were handling it?

33:11.522 --> 33:14.923
CABOT: From the detectives'
report, it appears the room
was immaculate.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.621
Katie had purchased diapers.
She was cooking dinner.

33:17.695 --> 33:19.458
They offered the detectives
chocolate milk.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.966
And Katie had also applied
for a job. Is that correct?

33:23.301 --> 33:25.531
Yes. At a nearby delicatessen.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.199
She and Danny filled out
the application together.

33:28.272 --> 33:31.605
Now, Miss Cabot,
you could have
declined to testify

33:31.676 --> 33:33.371
because of your
open rape case.

33:34.112 --> 33:35.477
Why didn't you?

33:35.546 --> 33:39.778
Our evidence indicates that
Katie has the coping skills
not only to Iive on her own

33:39.851 --> 33:42.285
and to care for a child,
but to make the decision

33:42.353 --> 33:44.480
whether or not
to have that child.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.753
Thank you, Counselor.

33:48.292 --> 33:51.557
Respondent's exhibit four,
Counselor.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.592
Recognize it?

33:55.833 --> 33:57.994
It's a DD5
written by Detective Benson.

33:58.069 --> 34:02.631
Yes, about Katie's interview
at Central Park Zoo
at which you were present.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.675
PIease read
the highlighted passage.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.768
"The victim
could not articulate
what happened to her

34:09.847 --> 34:13.179
"and expressed
unconditional compliance
to authority figures"'

34:13.251 --> 34:16.880
Now, Miss Cabot,
do you truly believe
that someone

34:16.954 --> 34:21.516
who cannot accurately
describe being attacked
can take care of a child?

34:21.592 --> 34:24.025
Objection.
Overruled.

34:24.094 --> 34:27.326
Many high-functioning women
cannot describe
the details of a rape.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.456
You're taking it
completely out of context.

34:29.534 --> 34:32.331
How many children do you have,
Miss Cabot?

34:33.871 --> 34:34.929
None.

34:35.005 --> 34:38.567
And have you ever taken care
of a child with special needs
Iike Katie?

34:38.643 --> 34:40.132
No, I haven't.

34:40.478 --> 34:44.641
Do you think buying diapers
six months before the birth

34:44.715 --> 34:45.943
demonstrates good judgment?

34:46.016 --> 34:47.780
Objection.
Withdrawn.

34:47.851 --> 34:51.481
Did you know that Katie
once set fire
to her mother's apartment

34:51.556 --> 34:53.786
by trying to use the stove?

34:53.858 --> 34:56.520
I set fire to my own stove
Iast year, Counselor.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.027
But, no, I didn't know that.

35:00.098 --> 35:04.797
And yet you sit here today
saying you know more
about what Katie's capable of

35:04.869 --> 35:05.961
than her own mother.

35:06.037 --> 35:09.131
Your Honor...
Withdrawn.
No further questions.

35:11.976 --> 35:15.707
Despite her IQ,
Katie's what we call
high-functioning.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.044
She has the ability
to process new information

35:18.116 --> 35:20.209
and to integrate it
into her daily Iife.

35:20.284 --> 35:24.380
In your expert opinion,
Doctor, would Katie
have been as vulnerable

35:24.455 --> 35:26.787
if her mother had
taught her about sex?

35:27.391 --> 35:31.418
Any woman can be sexually
assaulted, but, yes, Katie
was more vulnerable to rape

35:31.496 --> 35:33.896
because she didn't know
what was happening to her.

35:33.965 --> 35:37.059
Is sex education offered
at Katie's day program?

35:37.268 --> 35:39.463
Yes, it is,
but she never took it.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.198
CALDWELL: Tell us why,
if you know.

35:41.272 --> 35:44.264
It's my understanding
that her mother
refused to give consent.

35:44.342 --> 35:47.334
Doctor, could Katie
care for a child?

35:48.246 --> 35:51.682
With the proper education,
social service support
and case management,

35:51.749 --> 35:52.807
yes.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.215
Thank you.

35:55.052 --> 35:59.682
Doctor, what is your overall
conclusion regarding
Katie's competence

35:59.757 --> 36:01.452
to consent to sex?

36:01.926 --> 36:05.657
Katie didn't know what sex was
and therefore was incapable
of consenting.

36:05.730 --> 36:09.928
So she is not capable
of making decisions
that affect her Iife.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.694
That's not what I said.

36:11.769 --> 36:14.033
She is capable
of making decisions
and choices

36:14.105 --> 36:15.834
based on
the proper information.

36:15.907 --> 36:19.343
How much time
did you spend with Katie?
About two-and-a-half hours.

36:19.410 --> 36:22.811
Did you observe her
at her home?
No, at her day center.

36:22.880 --> 36:27.180
So, Doctor Huang,
your in-depth assessment
is based solely

36:27.251 --> 36:28.946
on having talked to her
in a vacuum.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.547
CALDWELL: Objection.
Withdrawn.
No further questions.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.725
Katie, do you Iove your mama?

36:40.731 --> 36:43.791
Yes, she's gonna
be the grandma.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.563
Does she Iet you
do the Iaundry?

36:46.637 --> 36:49.162
No, she says
I mess up the clothes.

36:50.107 --> 36:52.507
She doesn't Iet you use
the stove, either, does she?

36:52.577 --> 36:55.808
There was a fire.
Mama says it's dangerous.

36:56.514 --> 36:58.948
But Danny taught me.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.416
I made soup.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.150
Danny wants you to have
the baby, too, doesn't he?

37:05.289 --> 37:07.655
We got diapers and bottles.

37:07.758 --> 37:10.693
He's gonna show me
how to give baby the bath.

37:11.529 --> 37:15.488
I can do this, Mama.
I can do Iots of things.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.033
Katie, how do you change
a baby's diaper?

37:22.139 --> 37:24.004
I didn't Iearn that yet.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.009
Do you know
how to feed a baby?

37:27.712 --> 37:30.374
No, but I can.

37:31.616 --> 37:34.312
What do you do
when a baby has a fever?

37:35.019 --> 37:36.486
I don't know.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.280
You don't really know
how to be a mommy, do you?

37:40.358 --> 37:44.658
I can Iearn.
Danny will help me.

37:44.729 --> 37:48.688
But you can't do it
by yourself, can you?

37:58.376 --> 38:00.901
Stop! Stop this.

38:11.155 --> 38:13.589
Katie's mother is giving up
her guardianship.

38:13.658 --> 38:16.821
Now that Katie is competent,
our rape case against Abe
Cheney is out the window.

38:16.894 --> 38:18.327
My boss is gonna have my ass.

38:18.396 --> 38:21.661
Your boss is wrong.
DNA is back.
Cheney's the father.

38:21.732 --> 38:24.098
Convicting him of rape
is another story.

38:24.201 --> 38:26.533
Cheney's attorney
is going to use
my testimony to argue

38:26.604 --> 38:29.539
that Katie not only
understood what sex was
but consented.

38:29.607 --> 38:32.974
Katie was in his office
three days a week for their
personal training sessions.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.511
Somebody must have
seen her go in there.

38:34.578 --> 38:37.979
Or maybe she told someone
about it at work.
We just need to talk to Katie.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.950
Do you really think her mother
is gonna Iet you
anywhere near her?

38:41.018 --> 38:44.351
Well, maybe if we tell her
we've got good news
for a change.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.961
Your grandchild does not have
Down syndrome.

38:52.596 --> 38:55.759
Oh, thank God.

38:57.435 --> 39:01.064
But you didn't need
to meet us here
just to tell us that.

39:01.972 --> 39:06.306
We might Iose the rape case
against Cheney unless
we can talk to Katie.

39:12.483 --> 39:17.216
Katie, EIIiot and OIivia
want to ask you
some questions.

39:17.288 --> 39:18.312
Hi!

39:18.889 --> 39:21.449
Is that all right?
Sure.

39:24.562 --> 39:25.961
Hey, Katie!
Hey, OIivia!

39:26.030 --> 39:27.054
How you doing?
Okay.

39:27.131 --> 39:30.862
Good. Katie, I know
that it was a secret,

39:30.935 --> 39:34.871
but did you tell anybody
about exercising
with Mr. Cheney?

39:35.373 --> 39:37.273
No, he'd get mad at me.

39:37.575 --> 39:40.476
Did he ever
get mad at you before?
Once.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.375
Once. While you were
exercising?

39:42.446 --> 39:47.008
No, when I saw Mr. Cheney
exercising with Maryanne.

39:47.084 --> 39:48.483
He yelled at me.

39:50.054 --> 39:53.285
Exercising with Maryanne?
Does she work
at the store, too?

39:53.357 --> 39:55.791
Yes. She Iets me
play with Julie.

39:56.327 --> 39:59.296
Who's Julie?
Her baby girl.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.037
What's she doing here?

40:11.108 --> 40:13.372
You do have a right
to confront your accuser.

40:13.444 --> 40:15.969
Katie, I am...
Not a word, Abe.

40:16.914 --> 40:19.144
The DNA results came back.

40:19.216 --> 40:22.208
Congratulations, Mr. Cheney.
You're having a boy.

40:22.286 --> 40:23.514
We'II take sexual misconduct.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.521
No way your client walks
on a misdemeanor.

40:25.589 --> 40:26.783
Come on, Counselor,

40:26.857 --> 40:29.826
you don't want to
embarrass Katie in court
a second time, do you?

40:29.894 --> 40:33.660
She never said "no,"
she enjoyed it,
she kept coming back for more.

40:33.731 --> 40:37.963
Here's what I'm offering.
One count of rape two for
Katie. He does 10 years.

40:38.035 --> 40:41.493
We'II take
our chances in court.
I thought you might say that.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.369
Now what are you up to?

40:43.441 --> 40:45.068
Recognize any of these?

40:47.778 --> 40:51.179
CABOT: These are children
you fathered with women
who worked in your markets,

40:51.248 --> 40:53.842
three of whom were underage
at the time.

40:53.984 --> 40:55.474
We went through
your financials, Mr. Cheney.

40:55.553 --> 40:58.351
You've been paying off
the mothers for their silence.

40:58.823 --> 41:01.018
And now you're
gonna pay a Iot more.

41:02.993 --> 41:04.358
Petition for child support?

41:04.428 --> 41:06.726
Five more on the way
from the other mothers.

41:06.797 --> 41:11.291
That's six kids. Each receives
17% of your chain
of grocery stores,

41:11.368 --> 41:14.201
your personal fortune,
everything you own.

41:16.040 --> 41:20.670
Your money is going to take
care of Katie and her child
for the rest of their Iives.
