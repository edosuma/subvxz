WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:04.378
Here we go.
Peter.

00:04.380 --> 00:05.813
That's Sam's favorite
male nurse.

00:05.815 --> 00:07.248
He's gotten him
two years in a row

00:07.250 --> 00:10.384
for secret Santa,
and last year, he got him $500,

00:10.386 --> 00:11.919
and this year,
he got him crayons.

00:11.921 --> 00:13.721
All over the map,
that Peter.

00:13.723 --> 00:16.223
So, when you get to Sam's
birthday party, is the goal

00:16.225 --> 00:19.226
to impress his friends with
how much you know about them

00:19.228 --> 00:20.261
or to terrify them?

00:20.263 --> 00:21.729
I just want them to like me.

00:21.731 --> 00:22.596
Finally,

00:22.598 --> 00:23.931
I feel like I'm in

00:23.933 --> 00:25.833
an adult relationship.
He's a grown-up.

00:25.835 --> 00:27.501
Hey, Jess, heads up,
I borrowed your towel.

00:27.503 --> 00:28.836
Use your own towel
if you're gonna shower.

00:28.838 --> 00:30.738
No, I didn't shower,
I just sponged off.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.940
Ew.
Ugh! That's even worse.

00:32.942 --> 00:35.709
You didn't even get clean
before you used the towel.

00:35.711 --> 00:37.344
It's called a
French whore's bath.

00:37.346 --> 00:39.046
You wouldn't make a dime
as a French whore.

00:39.048 --> 00:40.181
You would make zero dollars.

00:40.183 --> 00:42.349
I'd make millions,
millions.

00:42.351 --> 00:44.785
Bonjour. Croissant.
Millions.

00:44.787 --> 00:46.454
Definitely not.
No.

00:46.456 --> 00:47.588
That's disrespectful. Here.

00:47.590 --> 00:48.722
(Jess and Cece scream)

00:48.724 --> 00:51.192
Happy Bird Day, Dr. Sam.

00:51.194 --> 00:53.627
Wow, you didn't
have to do that.

00:53.629 --> 00:55.062
Did you say, "Bird Day"?

00:55.064 --> 00:56.730
You heard me.
Well, you know, I figured

00:56.732 --> 00:58.732
Jess likes you,
so I like you, too, man.

00:58.734 --> 00:59.967
Welcome to the family.

00:59.969 --> 01:01.735
H-Hey, look at that.

01:01.737 --> 01:04.205
It's a shirt with
a whole lot of birds on it.

01:04.207 --> 01:05.906
That's a bird shirt.
Bird shirt.

01:05.908 --> 01:07.608
What? Why? What-what's the...?

01:07.610 --> 01:09.210
Ah, you know why.

01:09.212 --> 01:10.978
Cool shirt, dude.

01:13.916 --> 01:15.549
(chuckles)

01:15.551 --> 01:17.251
We're bird bros now.

01:17.253 --> 01:19.253
And check it out, you
can wear it to the party.

01:19.255 --> 01:21.722
You know, nothing says,
"This dude is dope,"

01:21.724 --> 01:23.991
like a motherflippin' finch,
am I right?

01:23.993 --> 01:25.092
(laughs)

01:25.094 --> 01:26.093
SCHMIDT:
Sam, I'm so sorry

01:26.095 --> 01:28.162
I won't be able
to attend your party.

01:28.164 --> 01:29.263
I have wedding stuff.

01:29.265 --> 01:30.264
"Stuff"?

01:30.266 --> 01:31.599
Define "stuff."

01:31.601 --> 01:32.600
Things.

01:32.602 --> 01:34.235
Thank you.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.138
I'm so excited
to meet your friends,

01:37.140 --> 01:39.507
including Dr. Garfinkel...

01:39.509 --> 01:40.774
(laughs)

01:40.776 --> 01:42.476
Sam, I love
the way you laugh.

01:42.478 --> 01:43.911
You never open your mouth.

01:43.913 --> 01:44.979
You're always like...

01:44.981 --> 01:46.514
(mimics Sam's laugh)

01:46.516 --> 01:47.948
I don't sound like that.
(laughs)

01:47.950 --> 01:49.350
No, you do. You just did it.

01:49.352 --> 01:50.618
(phone chimes)

01:50.620 --> 01:52.987
Hey, you got to add
a flash card.

01:52.989 --> 01:54.522
My friend Diane's coming.

01:54.524 --> 01:56.457
She's in town
for a podiatry conference.

01:56.459 --> 01:58.025
She's a friend
from med school.

01:58.027 --> 01:59.527
Oh, I've never
heard you mention her.

01:59.529 --> 02:00.861
You guys close?

02:00.863 --> 02:02.530
Diane!
Hi.

02:02.532 --> 02:04.131
(both laugh)

02:04.133 --> 02:05.966
They look... close.

02:05.968 --> 02:08.135
Hi!
It's so good to see you.

02:08.137 --> 02:09.937
So good to see you.

02:09.939 --> 02:11.972
Way too close.

02:11.974 --> 02:14.275
(both laughing)

02:16.179 --> 02:18.245
♪ ♪

02:20.149 --> 02:22.783
Hey, Schmidt, how many
robots are too many robots?

02:22.785 --> 02:23.717
Hi, Nick.

02:23.719 --> 02:25.452
Gavin.

02:25.454 --> 02:27.521
What are you doing here?

02:27.523 --> 02:28.989
I thought you'd be
at Sam's party.

02:28.991 --> 02:29.990
What's he doing here?

02:29.992 --> 02:31.225
Well, after the incident

02:31.227 --> 02:33.060
where my dad kissed...
(heaving)

02:33.062 --> 02:34.995
If you're gonna barf, just barf.
It's not healthy to hold it in.

02:34.997 --> 02:37.998
...where my dad kissed Jess,

02:38.000 --> 02:39.833
there was
an accidental pocket dial

02:39.835 --> 02:41.468
that actually
went pretty well.

02:41.470 --> 02:42.469
He suggested

02:42.471 --> 02:44.038
some wine tasting
for the wedding,

02:44.040 --> 02:45.739
and I said, "Why not?"

02:45.741 --> 02:47.841
You're just gonna drink
alone with your dad?

02:47.843 --> 02:49.977
Join us, Nick,
the Pinot from my vineyard

02:49.979 --> 02:51.178
is dynamite this year.

02:51.180 --> 02:52.513
It's gonna taste fantastic

02:52.515 --> 02:54.248
at my son's wedding
in a factory.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.584
Gavin, it's actually
a slaughterhouse,

02:56.586 --> 02:59.153
and you would know that
if you were around more.

02:59.155 --> 03:00.521
(pounds table)
Can I see you in my room

03:00.523 --> 03:01.589
for a second, please?

03:03.226 --> 03:04.391
Look, I know you
don't trust my dad,

03:04.393 --> 03:05.526
but I'm happy
that he's here.

03:05.528 --> 03:06.727
We're working
through stuff.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.095
Wait, Schmidt,
I want you to have

03:08.097 --> 03:09.263
a relationship with your father.

03:09.265 --> 03:10.564
I really do,
but I've been

03:10.566 --> 03:14.034
down this road so many times.

03:14.036 --> 03:16.403
He just shows up out of the boo,

03:16.405 --> 03:17.571
and then all of
a sudden expects...

03:17.573 --> 03:18.672
It's "blue," it's "blue."

03:18.674 --> 03:20.374
Well, thanks, Eye-stein.

03:20.376 --> 03:24.578
He shows you a great time,
you get sucked in,

03:24.580 --> 03:26.880
then he disappears
and breaks your heart,

03:26.882 --> 03:29.116
and I'm left to pick up
the pieces.

03:29.118 --> 03:31.518
My dad's taking me to...

03:31.520 --> 03:33.520
<i> Miss Saigon</i> tonight!

03:34.390 --> 03:35.589
And I'm not gonna get hurt.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.291
My dad never showed up.

03:37.293 --> 03:38.225
He didn't?

03:38.227 --> 03:39.927
It hurts so bad!

03:39.929 --> 03:41.362
You want a milkshake, cowboy?

03:42.965 --> 03:44.265
It's different now.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.532
I've heard that before.

03:45.534 --> 03:47.067
We're seeing<i> Jersey Boys!</i>

03:47.069 --> 03:48.802
Wait, this is your dad
we're talking about!

03:48.804 --> 03:50.271
And he's different now, Nick.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.906
(crying):
He's the same!

03:52.908 --> 03:54.041
I didn't have ice cream,

03:54.043 --> 03:55.576
so I just really
shook up some milk.

03:55.578 --> 03:59.146
I'm older and I'm wiser,
and I'm not gonna get sucked in.

03:59.148 --> 04:00.281
We're gonna
taste some wine,

04:00.283 --> 04:01.749
and then I'm gonna
send him on his way.

04:01.751 --> 04:04.785
But, Nick, I'm plead--
I'm asking you...

04:04.787 --> 04:07.588
just be nice to him.

04:07.590 --> 04:10.291
All right, man. I will.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.993
If it means that much to you,
of course, I'll do it.

04:12.995 --> 04:13.927
Thank you.

04:13.929 --> 04:15.496
But if it goes poorly,

04:15.498 --> 04:17.164
I'm not putting Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.232
Am I Humpty Dumpty?

04:18.234 --> 04:19.767
Yeah. I'm just not

04:19.769 --> 04:21.468
doing it again.
You won't have to.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.171
Also, nowhere in that rhyme
does it say he's an egg.

04:24.173 --> 04:26.073
He's most definitely
an egg, Nick.

04:26.075 --> 04:29.777
So, what kind of king
uses all those resources

04:29.779 --> 04:32.446
to put together one egg?

04:32.448 --> 04:33.447
It's a parable.

04:33.449 --> 04:34.848
Humpty Dumpty is the king.

04:38.854 --> 04:41.522
Who told you that?

04:42.325 --> 04:43.757
(laughing)

04:43.759 --> 04:45.292
I've never seen him
laugh like that.

04:45.294 --> 04:46.527
(both laughing)
What do I do?

04:46.529 --> 04:48.295
Think of it this way:
you're a dog,

04:48.297 --> 04:50.931
he's a fire hydrant,
you pee on him, girl.

04:50.933 --> 04:52.299
Yeah.
There you go.

04:52.301 --> 04:53.801
I'm gonna go lift a leg on him.

04:53.803 --> 04:55.102
There you go!

04:55.104 --> 04:57.137
Hey.
Oh, hey.

04:57.139 --> 04:59.106
So, Sam said he spilled
on the bird shirt

04:59.108 --> 05:00.541
and he had to take it off.

05:00.543 --> 05:02.276
He's putting on
a brave face,

05:02.278 --> 05:05.446
but, poor thing, I know
he is just crushed.

05:05.448 --> 05:06.347
Babe.
What, babe?

05:06.349 --> 05:07.648
He doesn't like the shirt.

05:07.650 --> 05:08.816
No, babe.
Yeah, babe.

05:08.818 --> 05:09.983
No, babe. Yeah, babe.

05:09.985 --> 05:11.985
No... babe.

05:11.987 --> 05:12.986
Yeah... babe.

05:12.988 --> 05:14.121
No, babe.
Yeah, babe.

05:14.123 --> 05:15.556
No... babe.

05:15.558 --> 05:17.124
Yeah... babe.

05:17.126 --> 05:18.459
No.

05:18.461 --> 05:19.626
Yeah.

05:19.628 --> 05:21.161
Babe.

05:21.163 --> 05:22.496
Sam, do you remember
in med school

05:22.498 --> 05:24.231
when we got drunk and
sewed fins on that dead guy?

05:24.233 --> 05:25.666
(both laugh)

05:25.668 --> 05:26.734
We made a merman!

05:26.736 --> 05:27.634
(laughs)

05:27.636 --> 05:29.470
Hey, Sam, remember
the other night

05:29.472 --> 05:32.740
when you ate all that
bad crab and, uh, you said,

05:32.742 --> 05:35.509
"Not tonight," and I said,
"Yeah, tonight,"

05:35.511 --> 05:37.644
and then you said,
"No, not tonight,"

05:37.646 --> 05:40.381
and then the next night,
when you were feeling better,

05:40.383 --> 05:42.182
remember what we did?

05:42.184 --> 05:44.651
We... we had sex?

05:44.653 --> 05:45.719
Had sex!

05:45.721 --> 05:46.920
(Jess laughs)

05:46.922 --> 05:48.589
The kind where
you need a snack after.

05:48.591 --> 05:49.723
Hey-o!

05:52.061 --> 05:53.727
(clears throat)

05:56.866 --> 05:58.565
Whoa.

06:01.003 --> 06:02.770
So, Jess,

06:02.772 --> 06:04.371
you're from Portland.
Do you, do you miss it?

06:04.373 --> 06:05.672
(coughing)
Do you miss Portland?

06:05.674 --> 06:07.107
I mean, I feel like
you never really...

06:07.109 --> 06:08.375
(Jess coughing)

06:08.377 --> 06:09.910
You... are you okay? Oh,
my God, are you choking?

06:09.912 --> 06:11.278
Is that what this is?
Oh, my God, stand up!

06:11.280 --> 06:12.279
Stand up, stand up!

06:12.281 --> 06:13.747
Get up, come here.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.015
Oh!

06:15.017 --> 06:16.049
(coughs)

06:16.051 --> 06:17.384
Here, sit down.

06:17.386 --> 06:18.952
(coughing)

06:20.055 --> 06:21.522
Thank you, Diane.

06:21.524 --> 06:22.956
You saved me.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.291
Any time.

06:24.293 --> 06:26.593
(sighs)

06:26.595 --> 06:28.862
Um, hey, Diane, um,

06:28.864 --> 06:33.200
would you like to go to
the ladies' room and freshen up?

06:33.202 --> 06:36.804
Yes, Jess, I would love to.

06:39.408 --> 06:40.741
I am so sorry.

06:40.743 --> 06:43.076
I'm really...
I'm-I'm embarrassed.

06:43.078 --> 06:44.578
Please, for what?
No, I am.

06:44.580 --> 06:45.913
For marking your territory?
Look, I get it.

06:45.915 --> 06:48.582
But I was acting childish
and dumb and jealous,

06:48.584 --> 06:49.716
and-and I...

06:49.718 --> 06:51.552
I see why Sam likes you.

06:51.554 --> 06:53.420
Well, I see why
he likes you, too.

06:53.422 --> 06:54.822
Will you forgive me?

06:54.824 --> 06:56.957
I have guy friends,
and I don't know why

06:56.959 --> 07:00.427
I would just assume that
you're wildly in love with him.

07:00.429 --> 07:01.762
Oh, no, I am.

07:01.764 --> 07:03.831
(laughs)

07:03.833 --> 07:05.065
No, really, I am.

07:05.067 --> 07:07.267
(laughs)

07:07.269 --> 07:08.268
Seriously, I am.

07:08.270 --> 07:10.304
(laughs)

07:10.306 --> 07:12.506
Jess, I'm-I'm in love with Sam.

07:13.576 --> 07:15.142
(whispers):
Oh, balls.

07:19.615 --> 07:20.747
Now this varietal
gained prominence

07:20.749 --> 07:22.950
in the '30s
as an Italian driving wine.

07:22.952 --> 07:25.018
Now they call it
a picnic wine,

07:25.020 --> 07:26.954
but we know what they're up to.

07:26.956 --> 07:28.088
But as they say,

07:28.090 --> 07:29.690
"Wine is fine,

07:29.692 --> 07:31.525
but bourbon is schwervin'."

07:33.796 --> 07:35.262
I think I got a buzz.

07:35.264 --> 07:36.063
Yeah, me too.

07:36.799 --> 07:37.865
Hang on.

07:37.867 --> 07:39.933
Uh, you're gonna like this.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.040
How much hooch do you have
stored in this place,

07:47.042 --> 07:48.509
you mountain person?

07:48.511 --> 07:49.810
Prohibition happened once.

07:49.812 --> 07:50.944
NICK and GAVIN:
It can happen again.

07:50.946 --> 07:52.012
Yeah.

07:53.349 --> 07:55.148
It was pretty easy to see
where you were going with that.

07:55.150 --> 07:56.650
Look at
the two of you.

07:56.652 --> 07:59.486
Bonding over the thing
that numbs you.

07:59.488 --> 08:01.321
(Nick and Gavin laugh)

08:01.323 --> 08:03.557
Smell this. Smell this.

08:03.559 --> 08:05.626
Oh! Let me get a whiff.
Let me get a whiff.

08:05.628 --> 08:06.660
Oh!

08:06.662 --> 08:07.728
Hurts so good.

08:10.332 --> 08:11.532
Sam.

08:11.534 --> 08:12.666
Guess who

08:12.668 --> 08:14.034
the luckiest boy
in the world is?

08:14.036 --> 08:15.202
It's you.

08:16.071 --> 08:18.338
It's an extra bird shirt, huh?

08:18.340 --> 08:19.973
I keep an extra one in my car,

08:19.975 --> 08:22.042
just in case I get
interviewed on television.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.810
Oh. Thank you.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.885
Put on the bird shirt, Sam.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.186
I will.

08:33.188 --> 08:34.354
When?

08:34.356 --> 08:36.323
When I don't have to

08:36.325 --> 08:40.160
take my other shirt off
in a bar full of people.

09:03.118 --> 09:04.718
Ten years?!
Yeah.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.019
You didn't tell him
for ten years?

09:06.021 --> 09:07.020
I did.

09:07.022 --> 09:08.221
Well, I tried to.

09:08.223 --> 09:10.223
Um, our second year
of med school,

09:10.225 --> 09:12.092
he went to work
with Doctors Without Borders.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.061
Well, so I didn't,
I didn't know when I was gonna

09:14.063 --> 09:15.729
see him again, and, um,

09:15.731 --> 09:17.798
one night, I-I just sat down
and wrote him a letter.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.232
(gasps) And everything
came out, you know,

09:19.234 --> 09:20.968
everything that I was
feeling, everything that

09:20.970 --> 09:22.202
I had been holding back.

09:22.204 --> 09:24.071
Yeah. I love letters.

09:24.073 --> 09:24.905
I know, me too.

09:24.907 --> 09:26.306
We have so much in common.

09:26.308 --> 09:28.075
Arguably too much.

09:28.077 --> 09:29.443
Mm.
But keep going.

09:29.445 --> 09:32.746
Well... Sam never responded.

09:32.748 --> 09:34.815
(scoffs)

09:34.817 --> 09:37.117
I just figured he didn't
want to embarrass me, you know?

09:37.119 --> 09:39.786
I mean, i-it's hard when
you're friends with a guy first.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.921
So...

09:40.923 --> 09:42.456
he came home, and we just

09:42.458 --> 09:44.992
kept on like normal,
and it was really painful,

09:44.994 --> 09:47.227
but I-I couldn't lose him
as a friend.

09:47.229 --> 09:49.630
Of course you couldn't.

09:49.632 --> 09:53.934
Then... last week,
this came in the mail.

09:53.936 --> 09:54.801
(gasps)

09:54.803 --> 09:57.704
"Return to sender."

09:58.841 --> 10:00.807
He never got it.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.943
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

10:02.945 --> 10:04.811
He never knew how you felt.

10:04.813 --> 10:09.249
No, and I-I came here tonight to
give him this letter and then...

10:09.251 --> 10:11.084
What happened?

10:11.086 --> 10:12.619
...I met you.

10:12.621 --> 10:13.787
Oh, right.

10:13.789 --> 10:14.955
Me.
Mm.

10:14.957 --> 10:16.757
Here.

10:16.759 --> 10:19.493
I can't throw it away,
but I can't give it to him.

10:19.495 --> 10:23.296
Don't worry, Jess, you...
you didn't do anything wrong.

10:23.298 --> 10:25.799
I'm not the one for Sam.

10:25.801 --> 10:27.134
You are.

10:27.136 --> 10:29.670
I'm gonna be really honest.

10:29.672 --> 10:33.874
Um, I'm having
a-a very hard time

10:33.876 --> 10:36.276
rooting for myself right now.

10:40.816 --> 10:43.016
JESS: Ugh! Ugh! (laughing)

10:43.018 --> 10:46.787
That was the most romantic story
I've ever heard.

10:46.789 --> 10:48.288
And I don't want
to get between them.

10:48.290 --> 10:49.489
Or do I?

10:49.491 --> 10:50.724
I love Sam,

10:50.726 --> 10:52.292
and I don't want
to throw it all away

10:52.294 --> 10:56.563
because she couldn't figure out
how to buy a Forever stamp.

10:56.565 --> 10:58.832
Just because you give Sam
this letter, it does not mean

10:58.834 --> 11:01.001
that he's automatically
gonna choose Diane.

11:01.003 --> 11:02.669
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

11:02.671 --> 11:06.239
(scoffs) Damn it.

11:06.241 --> 11:07.474
Look at them.

11:08.577 --> 11:12.713
♪ Moon river ♪

11:12.715 --> 11:15.248
♪ Wider than a mile ♪

11:15.250 --> 11:17.818
♪ I'm crossing you in style... ♪

11:17.820 --> 11:20.187
This song isn't even
on our jukebox.

11:20.189 --> 11:21.688
You know what, that's it.

11:21.690 --> 11:25.358
I'm-I'm not losing Sam
because I'm some dumb romantic.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.994
Cece, get rid of this letter.

11:27.996 --> 11:29.029
Lett'r done.

11:29.031 --> 11:30.430
Good-bye, Diane.

11:30.432 --> 11:34.034
Go back to fixing feet,
you sweet saint of a woman.

11:34.036 --> 11:35.202
You must be
so proud of me.

11:35.204 --> 11:38.338
I'm finally being practical
and realistic,

11:38.340 --> 11:40.741
and not some moony-eyed freak

11:40.743 --> 11:42.509
who's seen too many
romantic comedies.

11:42.511 --> 11:43.777
I'm basically being you.

11:43.779 --> 11:45.712
Not anymore, pal.

11:45.714 --> 11:48.548
Schmidt's made me
weak in my stupid knees.

11:48.550 --> 11:50.016
I don't know.

11:50.018 --> 11:52.552
This past year
with Schmidt's changed me.

11:52.554 --> 11:55.222
It's made me believe
in love stories.

11:55.224 --> 11:57.457
Is that why you were crying
during the bank commercial

11:57.459 --> 11:59.226
where the two old people
were texting each other?

11:59.228 --> 12:00.727
Jessica...
I know.

12:00.729 --> 12:02.963
They now have the money
that they need...

12:02.965 --> 12:05.298
No, I know.
...to be buried together.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.200
(laughs)

12:07.202 --> 12:09.369
We both know that
you're not gonna be able

12:09.371 --> 12:12.072
to live with yourself if you
don't give this letter to Sam.

12:12.074 --> 12:13.974
Yeah.

12:15.744 --> 12:17.277
What if I lose him?

12:17.279 --> 12:19.412
Well, then you'll
at least know, babe.

12:19.414 --> 12:21.014
It's not your love story.

12:22.551 --> 12:24.151
Oh.

12:24.153 --> 12:26.253
I have something to tell you.

12:26.255 --> 12:28.321
The old man
in the bank commercial,

12:28.323 --> 12:31.825
um, played a Nazi
in<i> Schindler's List.</i>

12:31.827 --> 12:33.560
Does that change anything?

12:36.598 --> 12:38.231
SCHMIDT: I made a model
of our wedding venue.

12:38.233 --> 12:39.432
NICK:
Wow.

12:39.434 --> 12:42.235
Your wine is so good,
I really want to showcase it

12:42.237 --> 12:43.937
and-and put the bar here.

12:43.939 --> 12:46.740
It's where they store
the drums of wild chemicals,

12:46.742 --> 12:48.608
but I'm pretty sure
they're empty now.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.777
Yeah, it's empty except for
the big puddle that never dries.

12:50.779 --> 12:51.778
GAVIN:
Oh, it'll be fine.

12:51.780 --> 12:52.946
With your mother there,

12:52.948 --> 12:54.781
that puddle will get drunk.

12:54.783 --> 12:56.449
How about we grab some dinner?

12:56.451 --> 12:58.785
(chuckles) Together?

12:58.787 --> 13:00.654
You...

13:00.656 --> 13:02.322
Yeah, no, I'd like that
very much.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.623
I'm gonna run home.

13:03.625 --> 13:05.492
Obviously, I can't wear
these shoes to dinner.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.793
Ha, can you imagine?

13:06.795 --> 13:09.529
I'll see you.

13:11.633 --> 13:13.967
I'm going to dinner with my dad.

13:13.969 --> 13:14.835
(door closes)

13:14.837 --> 13:15.936
This is so great, man.

13:15.938 --> 13:16.970
Yeah, it's great.

13:16.972 --> 13:18.471
You guys are finally
getting along.

13:18.473 --> 13:19.840
You were like,
"We've been down this road."

13:19.842 --> 13:21.842
It's great.
I just want to check in.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.276
Y-You said you weren't
gonna get sucked in,

13:23.278 --> 13:24.978
and it seems like
you're getting sucked in.

13:24.980 --> 13:26.046
Sucked in?
I'm not getting sucked in.

13:26.048 --> 13:27.147
If anybody's getting sucked,

13:27.149 --> 13:28.748
it's just me sucking myself in.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.384
No, I know how that sounded.
Yeah.

13:31.386 --> 13:32.619
But you, I mean you...
You good?

13:32.621 --> 13:33.954
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.390
(door closes)

13:37.392 --> 13:39.226
Hey, uh, Gavin, hold up.

13:39.228 --> 13:43.330
Um... I feel like I can say this
to you because, well,

13:43.332 --> 13:45.298
you know, we shared a cup.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.500
You really live
by a specific code.

13:47.502 --> 13:48.835
Look, we both know

13:48.837 --> 13:50.637
how this is gonna
go down, Gavin.

13:50.639 --> 13:52.505
You're gonna get
Schmidt's expectations up,

13:52.507 --> 13:54.241
and then you're gonna bail.

13:56.979 --> 13:58.311
I know.

13:58.313 --> 14:00.046
Just be better.

14:01.183 --> 14:02.916
Be his dad.

14:02.918 --> 14:05.719
Just be there for him,
even when it's not fun,

14:05.721 --> 14:08.021
and sometimes
it's really not fun.

14:08.023 --> 14:09.656
I know.

14:09.658 --> 14:12.993
I've been doing it for 15 years.

14:12.995 --> 14:14.928
Thank you.
Don't thank me.

14:14.930 --> 14:17.230
Just promise me if you show up
for dinner tonight,

14:17.232 --> 14:20.533
you'll show up tomorrow and the
day after and the week after,

14:20.535 --> 14:22.669
and basically forever.

14:23.605 --> 14:25.438
I will be there.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.907
Will you, Gavin?

14:26.909 --> 14:28.942
Will you?

14:28.944 --> 14:30.176
Will you, Gavin?

14:30.178 --> 14:32.245
I will.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.680
Will you?

14:35.617 --> 14:37.117
Will you, Gavin?

14:37.119 --> 14:38.852
You're really dragging this out.

14:38.854 --> 14:40.720
No, I've already gone through
everything I had rehearsed.

14:40.722 --> 14:42.756
I really thought the elevator
would be here by now.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.524
We could talk about other stuff.

14:46.061 --> 14:47.427
Can we, Gavin?

14:47.429 --> 14:48.461
Can we?

14:48.463 --> 14:50.096
Yeah.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.831
(elevator bell dings)
Can we, Gavin? Oh, thank God.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.371
I'm getting my birthday
present at an airport hotel?

14:58.373 --> 15:01.574
Oh, my God, are you taking me

15:01.576 --> 15:03.977
on a trip to meet my birth mother?
Oh.

15:03.979 --> 15:05.111
No, wait. (laughs)

15:05.113 --> 15:06.613
Um, no.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.416
Uh, it's, uh...
I have a surprise for you,

15:09.418 --> 15:11.551
but it's not exactly a present.

15:11.553 --> 15:13.253
Um, just wait here.

15:13.255 --> 15:14.587
Okay.

15:14.589 --> 15:17.390
Look, I want you to know
that no matter what happens,

15:17.392 --> 15:19.559
no-no matter
how this turns out--

15:19.561 --> 15:23.096
and by "this," you'll-you'll
see what I'm talking about--

15:23.098 --> 15:26.433
I want you to be happy.

15:26.435 --> 15:29.836
And I want you to be happy.

15:29.838 --> 15:33.006
But what did you want me to be
before this moment?

15:33.008 --> 15:35.141
Don't let me get a ticket, okay?

15:40.749 --> 15:42.048
Jess?

15:42.951 --> 15:44.184
Tell Sam.

15:45.854 --> 15:48.922
He-he deserves
to know how you feel.

15:50.993 --> 15:55.362
Wow, you are either really cool
or really cocky.

15:55.364 --> 15:58.631
<i> You</i> are either
really cool or really cocky.

15:58.633 --> 16:00.100
Thank you.

16:12.714 --> 16:15.915
I should've been more clear.
He's downstairs.

16:19.521 --> 16:22.489
I just want to let you know,
my shift is up, so Jason will

16:22.491 --> 16:24.791
be getting bummed out by you
for the rest of the night.

16:29.131 --> 16:31.097
Somebody order
a milkshake, cowboy?

16:33.035 --> 16:34.667
Well, Nick, you were right.

16:34.669 --> 16:36.569
I got sucked in.

16:36.571 --> 16:38.338
He was a car wash vacuum,

16:38.340 --> 16:40.673
and I was just
a stray pistachio.

16:40.675 --> 16:43.043
Listen, Schmidt, it's my fault.

16:43.912 --> 16:46.246
I got real with him
and he split.

16:46.248 --> 16:48.748
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.

16:48.750 --> 16:49.983
And, Nick?

16:49.985 --> 16:50.817
Yeah?

16:52.754 --> 16:54.721
Thank you.

16:54.723 --> 16:55.989
Thanks for what?

16:55.991 --> 16:57.757
For being there.

17:00.162 --> 17:02.495
What are you doing right now?

17:04.399 --> 17:06.099
(groans loudly)

17:06.101 --> 17:07.500
Yeah, man.
I like red meat.

17:07.502 --> 17:08.835
Yeah, yeah, no, beef.

17:08.837 --> 17:10.236
Sexy ladies.
Boobs.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.538
Moobs.
B-Boobs.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.106
Big boobs.
Yeah.

17:13.108 --> 17:14.541
Let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here.

17:14.543 --> 17:16.076
Oh, don't, don't, don't!

17:16.078 --> 17:18.545
Wait! Wait, guys, wait.

17:18.547 --> 17:20.447
I know I should have
been here an hour ago,

17:20.449 --> 17:21.714
but I was at the warehouse

17:21.716 --> 17:23.583
getting your
security deposit back.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.551
Why would you...

17:24.553 --> 17:25.785
Let me finish, trust me.

17:25.787 --> 17:27.754
That slumlord
wouldn't give it to me

17:27.756 --> 17:31.391
unless I cleaned the place,
and once I started...

17:31.393 --> 17:33.460
I don't know if you know,
but I'm a little OCD.

17:33.462 --> 17:35.195
Me, too. Yeah, it
runs in the family.

17:35.197 --> 17:37.597
Your grandfather had to touch
every lamppost he passed.

17:37.599 --> 17:38.565
He couldn't hold a job.

17:38.567 --> 17:39.732
Until he got a job

17:39.734 --> 17:40.934
as a lamppost repair man.

17:40.936 --> 17:41.968
Why wouldn't you just call?

17:41.970 --> 17:43.770
Oh, I got kicked in
the back of the head

17:43.772 --> 17:45.738
by some kids who were
using that dump as a place

17:45.740 --> 17:47.107
to practice
their urban dancing.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.975
They-they were honestly
pretty good,

17:48.977 --> 17:51.811
until they beat me
and took my phone.

17:51.813 --> 17:54.247
And my wallet and my watch.

17:54.249 --> 17:56.583
I had to run over here--
well, actually

17:56.585 --> 17:59.719
it was... it was more of a...
a walk-jog.

17:59.721 --> 18:00.854
I threw up once.

18:04.092 --> 18:06.726
I'm not very good
at doing the right thing

18:06.728 --> 18:08.628
when it comes to you.

18:10.098 --> 18:13.333
But I wanted to start tonight.

18:14.269 --> 18:16.569
You are not getting married

18:16.571 --> 18:18.138
at that slaughterhouse.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.940
Okay, well, then where am I
getting married?

18:20.942 --> 18:22.041
At my vineyard.

18:23.945 --> 18:26.146
If you want.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.615
It'll be beautiful.

18:28.617 --> 18:29.949
I talked to Cece.

18:29.951 --> 18:31.317
She said it's up to you.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.653
I just want you to know,
either way,

18:33.655 --> 18:36.856
I'm all in from here on out.

18:43.765 --> 18:46.666
We're getting married
at a vineyard.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.636
Yes! Yes.

18:49.638 --> 18:50.537
Getting married at a vineyard.

18:50.539 --> 18:51.471
GAVIN:
Yes.

18:51.473 --> 18:53.573
Yes, yes.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.010
So, you just left him
there to talk?

18:57.012 --> 19:00.346
Yep, I abandoned my own car,

19:00.348 --> 19:04.184
and now, for all I know,
Sam and Diane are tearing apart

19:04.186 --> 19:06.352
a business-friendly
hotel room together.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.787
Well, I'm really
proud of you.

19:07.789 --> 19:09.722
I know that it was hard,
but it's the only way

19:09.724 --> 19:11.457
you're gonna find out
what you need to know.

19:12.394 --> 19:14.227
Thanks.

19:14.229 --> 19:15.895
This might sound like
a cry for help,

19:15.897 --> 19:17.664
but I promise you it's not.

19:17.666 --> 19:19.966
Um, I'm gonna go to my room
and I'm gonna watch videos

19:19.968 --> 19:22.468
of dogs waiting for their
dead owners to come back.

19:22.470 --> 19:23.870
Mm-hmm.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.207
Cece, you want to
know what I think?

19:27.209 --> 19:28.675
Mm, not really.

19:28.677 --> 19:30.510
I think there are people
who get bird shirts,

19:30.512 --> 19:32.845
and there are people who don't.

19:32.847 --> 19:36.416
Jessica Day needs to be
with a bird shirt person.

19:36.418 --> 19:39.219
Am I a bird shirt person?

19:39.221 --> 19:42.722
Oh, Cece, why do you always
have to make things about you?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.791
(knocking at door)

19:48.063 --> 19:50.663
Sam, hello.

19:53.168 --> 19:54.667
(kisses)

19:54.669 --> 19:56.669
I forgive you.

19:56.671 --> 19:59.005
Okay. Okay.

19:59.007 --> 20:00.240
Is Jess here?

20:01.176 --> 20:02.775
She is.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.784
(dog whining over laptop)

20:14.022 --> 20:14.854
Hey.

20:14.856 --> 20:16.456
Hey. (chuckles)
Hey.

20:17.225 --> 20:19.859
I'm just, uh...

20:19.861 --> 20:21.527
Yeah, I'm really nervous,

20:21.529 --> 20:23.763
so I'm just gonna ask you
an innocuous question.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.532
Um... did you bring my car back?

20:26.534 --> 20:29.402
Yes, I have got
your keys right here.

20:29.404 --> 20:30.837
Thanks.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.376
Look, what you did
for me today was...

20:36.378 --> 20:40.380
the most selfless thing
anyone has ever done for me.

20:43.251 --> 20:45.551
Whatever...

20:45.553 --> 20:49.989
if there was ever a time
for me and Diane, it's passed.

20:49.991 --> 20:52.625
And when I read the letter,
it just reminded me

20:52.627 --> 20:55.561
how much that's true.

21:02.103 --> 21:03.736
(chuckles)

21:03.738 --> 21:06.306
Now that I know
you like letters, watch out.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.175
I have to say, that was
the strangest birthday surprise

21:09.177 --> 21:10.777
I have ever been given.

21:10.779 --> 21:12.945
Well, Winston took
my bird shirt idea, so...

21:12.947 --> 21:14.347
(laughs)

21:14.349 --> 21:15.815
You know what,
one of these days,

21:15.817 --> 21:17.283
I'm gonna get you to laugh
with your mouth open.

21:17.285 --> 21:18.851
I know you will.
That's what she said.

21:18.853 --> 21:20.286
No, that's not gonna do it.

21:20.288 --> 21:21.254
That's what she said.

21:21.256 --> 21:22.455
You just said the same thing.

21:22.457 --> 21:24.157
(Italian accent):
Now that's what she said.

21:24.159 --> 21:25.191
That's... What accent is that?

21:25.193 --> 21:26.526
It's Italian.
Oh, really?

21:26.528 --> 21:28.795
That's what she said!
Nope, that didn't

21:28.797 --> 21:29.762
do it, either.
That's<i> what</i> she said.

21:29.764 --> 21:31.297
Now you're just
changing the stress.

21:31.299 --> 21:32.699
That's what she said?

21:32.701 --> 21:34.400
Maybe you should stop.
(laughs)

21:36.137 --> 21:38.438
JESS: That's<i> what she said. Ooh.</i>
SAM:<i> Ooh. That was closer.</i>
