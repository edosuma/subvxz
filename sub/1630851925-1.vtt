00:46.838 --> 00:47.838
Sorry I'm late.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.803
Happy birthday.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.136
Aw.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.849
Oh, I have something for you, too.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.183
What is it?

00:59.268 --> 00:59.851
You'll see later.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.185
I'll be home for dinner.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.107
Wait! — what?

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
I love you.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.448
I have something to tell
you and it can't wait.

01:13.782 --> 01:14.782
What is it?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.202
I'm pregnant.

01:17.536 --> 01:20.247
Really? Seriously?

01:20.581 --> 01:21.707
We're gonna have a baby.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.793
Oh my god, I'm gonna be a daddy!

01:25.127 --> 01:27.045
Are you happy? — yes.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.340
I love you. Very much. —good.

01:30.674 --> 01:33.010
Listen, I have to go now,
so I'll see you tonight.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.343
Okay. — okay.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.597
I'm gonna be a daddy!

01:38.223 --> 01:40.350
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

02:05.917 --> 02:06.543
Good, good, good.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.396
All right, get her over here, come on.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.132
Help me, help me, help!

02:12.466 --> 02:15.886
All right, bring her in.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.219
Help! — hey!

02:17.387 --> 02:18.513
Help!

02:21.433 --> 02:23.143
Come here. — no, help me!

03:36.925 --> 03:39.845
I can't believe that
John's wife was murdered.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.178
That's terrible.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.014
It's such a tragedy.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.641
I know that I should help him,

03:44.975 --> 03:46.095
but I'm not sure that I can.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.354
Now, randi, I'm the
boss here, that's my job.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.441
But you, you're one of
the best damn reporters,

03:52.774 --> 03:54.276
and this city needs you.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.110
It's important.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.444
Yeah. — we have to stop

03:56.486 --> 03:58.071
these abductions.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.157
Now, you focus on your job, okay?

04:00.490 --> 04:04.411
Absolutely, it's my job, I know, I know.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.954
But what about John?

04:06.288 --> 04:07.288
Let's go talk to him.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.330
He's probably home.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.666
Let's go.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.111
It's not fair.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.490
It's not fair.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.201
Why?

05:29.412 --> 05:31.248
Why?!

05:32.415 --> 05:34.459
Why?!

05:58.775 --> 06:01.903
John, I'm here for you.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.738
I just heard what happened to you.

06:05.657 --> 06:09.077
Please, John, you have to try
and pull yourself together.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.411
Just go away.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.915
I'm sure you feel lonely.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.045
You have to be strong.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.672
Do it for yourself.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.719
Plus, you have to be strong for nita.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.137
It's what she'd want.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.974
I'm always here for you.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.309
Leave me alone.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.854
It's okay, I'm here for you.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.566
Just leave me alone.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.192
John, you mean the world to me.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.403
I love you so much.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.736
Nita.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.423
I'm sorry.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.097
I'm sorry.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.150
These are the ones I want.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.741
I'll arrange it.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.076
Any more available?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.578
I'm willing to pay extra.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.539
My clients have very large appetites.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.797
I'll take them, all of them.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.929
I need some time.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.890
It's not that simple to arrange.

09:59.891 --> 10:03.561
I understand, but my
clientele is very hungry now.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.316
Trust me when I say that your clientele

10:08.650 --> 10:11.694
will be so pleased.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.077
That's so exciting. — indeed.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.287
I will contact you when the shipment

10:21.621 --> 10:24.374
is ready to send overseas.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.461
Wonderful doing business with you.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.174
We're finished here.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.389
Let go of me. — whoa.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.892
Got you, punk.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.068
Get off of me, let me go!

11:34.402 --> 11:36.279
Wait, I'll give the money.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.952
You'll never catch me!

11:48.291 --> 11:49.834
What's the problem?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.879
I was just on my way home.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.213
Bullshit.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.635
Now, you be a nice boy

12:01.804 --> 12:05.183
and pay me what you owe, now.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.314
But I don't have any.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.900
Man, you messing with the wrong guy.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.278
I know you street kids make money

12:17.612 --> 12:19.530
and I want my cut.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.492
Why don't we shake you
and see what falls out?

12:25.870 --> 12:28.498
Put me down,
I don't have any money.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.832
Put him down.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.379
Okay, okay, I'll get you money soon.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.089
You better.

12:41.970 --> 12:42.970
Let's go.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.561
Check this out!

14:28.451 --> 14:29.931
What the hell?

14:33.456 --> 14:34.456
Where's my money?

14:35.917 --> 14:36.917
Relax.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.045
Pay this guy.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.635
Whoa, whoa.

14:45.968 --> 14:46.968
Oh, shit.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.610
Man, get the fuck off of me.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.704
Hey, what's he doing there?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.038
What you got there, huh?

15:24.132 --> 15:26.050
Hey, China town, what you offering?

15:35.518 --> 15:37.311
Say, let me hold on to this.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.439
Give it to me.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.026
Man, hand it over.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.037
Damn it!

17:08.109 --> 17:09.237
Hey

17:09.569 --> 17:12.490
man,
don't sneak up on me like that.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.157
I need to talk to you.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.954
Make it quick, I'm very busy.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.414
My name is John liu.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.626
My wife, she was murdered
a few days ago —...

17:23.960 --> 17:25.561
Yea h, of course, right.
—that's why I'm here.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.045
I want to know: What

17:26.378 --> 17:27.647
are you doing about it?
— "what are you doing

17:27.672 --> 17:28.672
about it."

17:28.714 --> 17:30.591
I get it, believe me.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.718
But these things take time, Mr. Liu.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.929
We're doing everything we can, okay?

17:35.263 --> 17:36.263
Just be patient.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.557
Be patient?

17:37.890 --> 17:42.061
Listen, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry about your wife.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.230
Hey, this is a big city.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.924
You've seen what's it like, right?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.191
We're doing what we can.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.860
That's it? That's all you can tell me?

17:50.194 --> 17:53.322
My wife is dead, and
you're telling me to wait?

17:53.656 --> 17:56.826
These men murdered her
because of what she saw.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.439
It's linked to these abductions.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.162
Why aren't you doing something about it?

18:00.496 --> 18:04.625
Believe me, I am,
but this isn't helping.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.086
Just go home and I'll
call you with anything.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.880
Wait.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.214
What?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.507
This city owes me.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.011
Well, what's that?

18:15.344 --> 18:16.344
Justice.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.265
Good luck, Mr. Liu.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.393
Thanks for nothing.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.950
Why? Why is this happening?

18:38.284 --> 18:39.910
Why won't anyone do anything?

18:40.244 --> 18:42.204
I don't understand, why?

18:44.165 --> 18:45.165
Why?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.167
Why?!

19:53.859 --> 19:56.237
Hey, pretty lady,
why don't you ditch this loser

19:56.570 --> 19:57.970
and I'll show you a good time, huh?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.282
How about a kiss?

20:14.338 --> 20:15.840
Let's get 'em, boys, come on.

20:24.014 --> 20:27.143
Let's get 'em, come on, guys!

21:19.153 --> 21:21.363
Hey, mama, where you going, huh?

21:22.531 --> 21:24.617
Hey, hey, I just wanna
talk, come back here.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.634
Watch while I cut off her dress.

21:58.776 --> 21:59.776
No!

22:01.445 --> 22:02.696
No!

22:09.411 --> 22:11.163
What the hell was that?

22:11.497 --> 22:12.164
Vvhatthe?

22:12.498 --> 22:13.498
What the fuck?

22:15.501 --> 22:16.501
Dude.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.462
Dude, what happened?

22:18.796 --> 22:19.796
Is he okay?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.550
What, shit?

22:22.883 --> 22:24.385
Where'd that come from?

22:53.163 --> 22:56.083
Wow, look how big the buildings are.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.961
I think we got off on the wrong stop.

23:00.796 --> 23:01.422
It should be right here.

23:01.755 --> 23:02.955
Well, let's look at the map.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.132
Help! — hey!

23:06.218 --> 23:07.761
Someone stop them!

23:08.095 --> 23:09.722
Hey, over there! — I see it.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.243
Do you see that?

23:13.267 --> 23:14.267
Oh, my god.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.483
Come on.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.738
Hey, hey, hey, you did it.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.490
We pulled it off!
— yeah, I know!

23:28.824 --> 23:30.385
Yeah, look what I got.
— look what I got.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.609
Yeah, what'd you get?

23:31.660 --> 23:32.244
Vvhatthe? —huh?

23:32.578 --> 23:34.663
Who the fuck are you?

23:36.290 --> 23:38.667
Oh my god, thank you, thanks so much.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.629
I can't believe he got it back.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.424
That was amazing.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.752
There he goes!

23:54.892 --> 23:55.892
Get his ass!

24:02.733 --> 24:04.151
Let's go, come on.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.488
Aw, shit, get up, go!

24:07.821 --> 24:08.981
Let's get him, let's get him!

24:13.452 --> 24:15.871
Don't move, asshole!

24:26.799 --> 24:30.135
There he goes! Come on, get him.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.437
We got him now.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.198
Oh my god, they got him.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.833
Take it easy, don't kill me.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.127
Tell the others

25:05.212 --> 25:06.588
I'm coming for them.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.472
She kissed me down there.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.365
Yo, this chick was totally rad, man.

25:33.699 --> 25:37.745
Panties off and everything,
man, it was crazy!

25:45.044 --> 25:46.962
So interesting.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.179
Hey, what about these guys?

25:57.222 --> 25:58.502
They look like trouble.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.599
We should follow them.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.310
Slow down.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.145
Huh?

26:05.773 --> 26:06.833
Let's keep following them

26:06.857 --> 26:07.857
and see where they go.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.381
Man, what a night.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.384
I can't believe we did all that.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.305
All over the city.

28:02.848 --> 28:06.185
Hey, I'm hungry, I'll be right back.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.603
Stay here.

28:07.936 --> 28:08.437
I don't know.
— do you think he's cute?

28:08.770 --> 28:09.770
I guess.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.356
I think you should talk to him.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.439
I never really
thought about him that way.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.406
I, for one, think you
should give him a chance.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.741
I think you two would
make a really cute couple.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.078
I'm serious, I think you'd be cute.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.541
Hey!

28:31.084 --> 28:32.419
Get off of me!

28:32.753 --> 28:35.130
Oh my god, those guys are crazy.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.389
Quick, run!

28:45.974 --> 28:48.810
Come on, come here.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.144
Get off!

28:53.857 --> 28:55.859
Come on, come on!

28:56.193 --> 28:57.986
Get off of me!

28:59.029 --> 29:00.280
Come on, sweetie.

29:03.033 --> 29:04.868
Help, help!

29:14.503 --> 29:16.380
Oh no, somebody help!

29:25.305 --> 29:26.932
This is awful. — come on!

29:27.266 --> 29:29.309
Aw, come on. — get off of me!

29:29.643 --> 29:31.561
Let's show this bitch who's boss.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.273
Who's that?

29:35.357 --> 29:37.943
Where did that come from?

29:38.277 --> 29:39.444
I can't believe it.

29:39.778 --> 29:40.778
Keep filming.

29:41.947 --> 29:45.367
Looks like we got
ourselves a hero.

29:45.701 --> 29:48.453
Oh my god,
let's get out of here.

29:49.997 --> 29:51.957
Let's teach this guy a lesson.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.584
Yeah, let's get him.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.538
He's real, see? — he saved us!

30:57.356 --> 30:59.358
Ah!

31:02.527 --> 31:03.527
Who is that?

31:38.939 --> 31:39.940
Huh?

31:58.834 --> 32:00.752
Did you see that?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.295
Incredible!

32:02.629 --> 32:04.005
Where'd he come from?

32:04.339 --> 32:05.424
Where did he go?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.844
Hey, did I miss anything?

32:11.263 --> 32:13.890
Yes, you did. — yes, you did.

32:15.142 --> 32:19.563
Oh... uh...

32:28.113 --> 32:30.240
Look at you, you're trash.

32:32.617 --> 32:36.997
Shut up.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.963
Look at you, already on
your back where you belong.

32:45.297 --> 32:49.593
And you! What do you think
you're looking at, huh?

32:49.926 --> 32:52.637
Look at the ground!

32:54.514 --> 32:57.058
Yeah.

33:03.732 --> 33:04.732
Yeah.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.951
Oh, look at this piece of shit.

33:18.622 --> 33:19.998
What are you doing, man?

33:20.332 --> 33:21.332
No way.

33:29.716 --> 33:30.800
You need a hand?

33:31.134 --> 33:32.361
Oh, the guy needs a bat.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.443
Hey, randi, look at that.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.612
Oh my god, look what they're doing.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.026
Shit, hang on, get ready.

33:52.280 --> 33:52.864
They're destroying

33:53.198 --> 33:54.558
thatcar
— I gotta get this on film.

33:55.784 --> 33:56.785
These guys are

33:57.118 --> 33:58.411
probably on drugs. —jack.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.622
Man, they're— — uh, Jack.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.418
Jack, that's your car.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.427
Hey, that's my car!

34:14.761 --> 34:16.721
Yeah, let's go. — push, push!

34:19.683 --> 34:20.683
Take that!

34:22.686 --> 34:23.311
What the hell?

34:23.645 --> 34:24.145
Get away from my car!

34:24.478 --> 34:26.273
What's wrong with you?

34:26.606 --> 34:27.606
Get away from it!

34:27.649 --> 34:29.359
Flhugsshouu

34:29.693 --> 34:31.277
get off me, stop it!

34:31.610 --> 34:33.487
Get off me, I told you!

34:33.822 --> 34:35.114
Don't hurt him!

34:35.447 --> 34:37.242
Oh my god, get away from me!

34:39.411 --> 34:40.491
Just keep the car!

34:42.871 --> 34:45.292
Yeah, come here.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.085
Take that!

34:49.629 --> 34:50.748
Hey, get back here!

34:50.839 --> 34:52.507
Get 'em. — help, help!

34:52.841 --> 34:56.219
Help, help! — surprise, bitch!

34:59.681 --> 35:01.266
Come here.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.600
Gotcha!

35:07.188 --> 35:09.482
Come back here!

35:09.816 --> 35:10.816
Come back, baby!

35:16.364 --> 35:18.033
Police, the police!

35:19.576 --> 35:21.578
Hey, hey, get back here!

35:29.294 --> 35:33.089
Shit.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.258
Stop it, get away from me!

35:35.592 --> 35:36.760
_ wh no! Ere you going?

35:39.888 --> 35:41.640
No, no, no!

35:41.973 --> 35:42.973
There we go.

35:48.688 --> 35:49.688
Shh!

35:50.523 --> 35:51.523
Stupid!

35:54.235 --> 35:55.235
Help me!

36:02.160 --> 36:05.372
Come on, over
here, come over here.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.025
Get him, grab him!
— stop running!

36:07.832 --> 36:08.832
Got him. — got you.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.627
Yeah, get him, get him.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.188
"New York ninja"?

36:32.399 --> 36:33.900
Hey, who threw that?

36:34.234 --> 36:36.277
Come out, punk! Let's go!

36:39.322 --> 36:41.408
Should we slit his throat?

36:41.741 --> 36:42.741
Let's gut him.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.663
Wait, let's throw his ass
off the fucking building

36:46.996 --> 36:49.958
and see if he can fly.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.752
Hey!

36:59.467 --> 37:01.136
Let's get him!

37:01.469 --> 37:03.221
Come on, after him, after him!

37:15.024 --> 37:16.276
Son of a bitch!

37:52.479 --> 37:54.564
Drop it, asshole. Now.

38:01.237 --> 38:02.237
Get up.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.754
Get him over to the edge.

38:21.549 --> 38:24.052
Ready for round two, asshole?

38:34.145 --> 38:35.605
The knife! Catch!

38:37.524 --> 38:38.524
Shit!

39:15.937 --> 39:18.481
Whoa, whoa, wait, hey,

39:18.815 --> 39:21.526
I got more footage of the ninja here.

39:21.860 --> 39:22.860
You gotta see it.

39:22.902 --> 39:23.945
I got something better.

39:26.114 --> 39:28.491
"New York ninja"?

39:28.825 --> 39:29.825
Where'd you get this?

39:35.123 --> 39:37.750
Randi, thank god you're all right.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.962
Look at this.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.463
We're going live with this.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.425
You can have that one for yourself.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.760
Hey, where you going?

39:48.845 --> 39:49.971
Home.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.289
Shit!

40:29.469 --> 40:30.469
Yeah!

40:36.851 --> 40:38.645
Where are you going?

40:38.978 --> 40:39.978
To see you.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.068
Don't you lie to me, kid.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.990
Where you going, kid?

40:51.324 --> 40:51.991
Show this kid we

40:52.325 --> 40:53.925
mean business.
— don't mess with us, kid.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.721
You're in trouble now, buddy.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.963
Please, someone help me!

41:05.296 --> 41:06.296
Help me!

41:11.052 --> 41:13.096
Well, if it isn't the ninja.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.328
He got 'em.

41:40.248 --> 41:41.624
Shit, let's go! — let's roll!

41:41.958 --> 41:43.209
Come on, fuck!

43:03.122 --> 43:06.042
Hey, you're okay.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.258
Hey, are you really the ninja?

43:15.301 --> 43:16.301
Shh.

43:18.513 --> 43:19.597
Will you be my friend?

43:22.225 --> 43:23.476
Mm—hmm.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.111
Here.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.570
It's yours now.

43:45.581 --> 43:46.874
Get some rest.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.208
You'll be better soon.

43:58.928 --> 43:59.554
It's been several weeks

43:59.887 --> 44:00.429
now since any sightings

44:00.763 --> 44:02.403
of the New York ninja have been reported.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.523
However, crime has
remained at an all—time low

44:04.642 --> 44:07.395
thanks to ninja fever,
which continues to spread

44:07.728 --> 44:08.729
throughout the city.

44:09.063 --> 44:11.315
Abductions of young women
are still being reported,

44:11.649 --> 44:12.809
and the body of another woman

44:12.859 --> 44:15.695
with mysterious radiation
burns has been discovered.

44:16.028 --> 44:17.589
The police are now labeling these murders

44:17.613 --> 44:19.448
as the work of the plutonium killer.

44:19.782 --> 44:20.283
What are you doing?

44:20.616 --> 44:22.243
Going fishing.

44:22.577 --> 44:23.077
Now back to the music.

44:23.411 --> 44:24.704
You call that fishing?

44:25.663 --> 44:26.663
Of course!

44:43.764 --> 44:45.099
Huh?

44:45.433 --> 44:46.433
Igotone!

44:57.653 --> 45:00.364
Yes, I got one!

45:00.698 --> 45:03.534
I told you.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.454
Look, I got one.

45:06.787 --> 45:07.787
Hey

45:17.548 --> 45:18.674
Beginner's luck.

45:47.954 --> 45:48.996
I want that one.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.330
What one?

45:50.373 --> 45:51.373
That mask over there.

45:51.540 --> 45:52.041
Huh?

45:52.375 --> 45:53.751
Oh, you don't wanna be a clown.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.795
Please, I want to get that one.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.338
Come on, please?

45:57.672 --> 45:58.881
Okay, let's go.

46:09.225 --> 46:10.225
I'm sorry.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.188
Did you drop this?

46:14.522 --> 46:16.107
No, I don't think so.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.651
Look very closely at it.

46:25.825 --> 46:29.287
I like your
mask. Happy Halloween!

46:31.789 --> 46:33.833
Huh?

46:34.166 --> 46:37.420
Look closely, watch it
swing back and forth.

46:40.756 --> 46:45.094
Listen to my voice and
go to sleep.

47:47.573 --> 47:51.243
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yea h, yea h, yeah.

48:01.921 --> 48:05.132
Oh, yeah.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.960
Gimme that necklace.

48:44.171 --> 48:46.674
She's sleeping.

48:47.007 --> 48:48.467
Shut the fuck up, old man!

48:48.801 --> 48:49.801
Give me all your money!

48:50.845 --> 48:52.054
Pardon me, sir.

48:52.388 --> 48:53.389
What the?

49:39.268 --> 49:42.438
That's it, you son of a bitch.

50:09.173 --> 50:10.716
Is it another one?

50:11.634 --> 50:13.636
Mm—hmm, looks that way.

50:15.054 --> 50:16.054
What do we got?

50:18.390 --> 50:20.392
Well, looks like she was strangled.

50:20.726 --> 50:21.886
Any burn marks?

50:22.186 --> 50:23.521
It's possible.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.624
Let's get
the body to the morgue.

50:25.648 --> 50:27.191
So, what do you want from me?

50:27.525 --> 50:29.485
Call me with the autopsy report.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.195
You know what it's going to be.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.571
Yeah, I do.

51:08.649 --> 51:10.651
Oh, Christ.

51:21.161 --> 51:22.161
You're late.

51:23.038 --> 51:25.082
You said five.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.335
Well, I have 5:30.

51:36.594 --> 51:38.429
This is all you have?

51:38.762 --> 51:41.223
I'm worried about all this exposure.

51:41.557 --> 51:43.767
I think we need to move this along.

51:44.101 --> 51:47.229
Forcing us any faster
will only end badly for you.

51:48.230 --> 51:50.024
For your sake, I hope not.

51:52.943 --> 51:55.613
I have to do it my way.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.990
This is my problem.

51:58.324 --> 51:59.964
Well, if you can't get it done in time,

52:00.242 --> 52:02.620
we will just have to do it my way.

52:05.914 --> 52:07.374
You just wait.

52:27.686 --> 52:29.647
I had a meeting with our buyer.

52:30.689 --> 52:31.940
Okay.

52:32.274 --> 52:34.354
He wants to move rather quickly.

52:34.485 --> 52:37.279
We need to arrange transport.

52:37.613 --> 52:38.781
I'll have things ready.

52:39.114 --> 52:40.741
Also, that reporter

52:41.075 --> 52:43.786
is starting to get too close.

52:44.119 --> 52:46.664
You and your men have been sloppy!

52:46.997 --> 52:50.376
Bring her to me and no mistakes!

52:50.709 --> 52:51.709
Do you understand me?

52:51.960 --> 52:53.962
Yes, yes!

52:54.296 --> 52:55.982
I will contact you soon.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.299
Shit!

52:57.633 --> 52:58.926
What does he think I am, huh?

52:59.927 --> 53:02.471
I bust my ass all over
this whole fucking city.

53:03.931 --> 53:04.556
Hey. — fuck this!

53:04.890 --> 53:06.141
We're still getting paid.

53:06.475 --> 53:08.560
Besides, who cares?

53:08.894 --> 53:10.104
Shit, I care!

53:11.188 --> 53:12.856
Fuck this shit, I'm done!

53:14.191 --> 53:15.192
Forget it.

53:15.526 --> 53:19.071
We get this job done, then we
show that guy who the boss is.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.448
Let's go. — all right.

53:23.534 --> 53:26.245
Okay, could be anyone.

53:30.124 --> 53:35.045
Huh, it's gotta be! The ninja!

53:35.587 --> 53:36.672
It's gotta be!

53:39.091 --> 53:40.091
Janet.

53:43.011 --> 53:44.221
What are you doing?

53:44.555 --> 53:46.056
I'm undercover.

53:46.390 --> 53:48.475
I've never seen you
look like this before.

53:48.809 --> 53:49.809
That's the point.

53:52.312 --> 53:54.273
New York ninja.

53:54.606 --> 53:55.606
Really?

53:55.774 --> 53:56.774
Not this.

53:56.942 --> 53:57.942
What's the problem?

53:58.193 --> 53:59.278
Are you jealous?

54:04.158 --> 54:05.798
Mayor Lewis, can you talk about

54:05.826 --> 54:08.537
how the city is handling
the New York ninja?

54:08.871 --> 54:10.581
As you know, randi, the public opinion

54:10.914 --> 54:12.332
on the New York ninja is split.

54:12.666 --> 54:14.626
Some see him as a hero, while others,

54:14.960 --> 54:17.463
such as the police, see
him merely as a vigilante.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.276
We can't just let a masked individual

54:19.590 --> 54:20.750
roam the streets of our city,

54:20.924 --> 54:22.484
even if he is trying to protect people.

54:22.801 --> 54:24.237
And what do
you have to say about

54:24.261 --> 54:27.055
the recent murders and
abductions of young women?

54:27.389 --> 54:29.558
My office has been working
diligently with the police

54:29.892 --> 54:31.132
to solve these horrific crimes,

54:31.435 --> 54:32.755
and I'd like to remind the people

54:32.853 --> 54:35.522
that we are strong on crime, and together,

54:35.856 --> 54:37.232
we have the power.

54:37.566 --> 54:38.901
That gives us all hope.

54:39.234 --> 54:42.237
This is randi Rydell reporting
for channel six news.

54:44.198 --> 54:44.865
Thank you.

54:45.157 --> 54:46.867
This has been a pleasure.
— any time.

54:47.201 --> 54:48.869
I'm glad the weather held out.

54:49.203 --> 54:49.787
It turned out to be a nice day.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.622
The kids are playing on the swings,

54:51.955 --> 54:54.041
and no one is causing any

54:54.374 --> 54:55.614
hey! — hey, what are you doing?

54:57.419 --> 54:57.961
Hey!

54:58.295 --> 54:59.895
Don't move, don't fucking move.

55:02.257 --> 55:03.257
I said, don't move.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.304
Hey.

55:09.223 --> 55:10.641
Hey!

55:10.974 --> 55:13.519
What you gonna do, you fat bitch?

55:13.852 --> 55:15.979
Sit your ass down.

55:16.313 --> 55:17.356
Relax.

55:20.484 --> 55:21.777
Marcus.

55:22.110 --> 55:24.613
I got a plan, let's get
some of the other kids.

55:26.657 --> 55:27.825
Let go of me!

55:28.867 --> 55:30.410
Let her go!

55:34.373 --> 55:37.167
Shut the fuck up or
I'll slit your throat.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.336
Let's go, let's go.

55:41.380 --> 55:42.548
My eyes!

55:46.969 --> 55:48.011
What the?

55:59.398 --> 56:00.398
Oh, right.

56:03.068 --> 56:04.152
Let's get 'em! — get 'em!

56:04.486 --> 56:05.529
Get outta here!

56:08.323 --> 56:09.323
Get out!

56:11.618 --> 56:12.618
Yeah!

56:14.580 --> 56:16.874
Oh, ow.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.834
Here, get 'em!

56:20.711 --> 56:22.296
Get off me!

56:28.510 --> 56:29.136
Come on.

56:29.469 --> 56:30.637
Yeah, we did it!

56:30.971 --> 56:32.723
Get out of here and don't come back!

56:33.056 --> 56:35.934
Thank you. — yea h, we're great!

56:36.268 --> 56:38.604
Yeah, yeah!

56:40.606 --> 56:42.149
Are you all right? — I'm okay.

56:43.609 --> 56:45.277
I'm glad you're all right.

56:45.611 --> 56:47.112
Are you all right, John?

56:47.446 --> 56:49.656
We did it. — that was crazy.

56:55.621 --> 56:57.181
Channel six's own randi Rydell

56:57.205 --> 56:58.332
was attacked earlier today.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.001
A group of armed assailants
assaulted miss Rydell

57:01.335 --> 57:03.045
while she was interviewing the mayor.

57:03.378 --> 57:04.880
Luckily, a group of children dressed

57:05.213 --> 57:07.424
like the New York ninja
spoiled the attempt.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.278
There's no word on whether this attack

57:09.384 --> 57:11.345
has any connection to
the recent kidnappings,

57:11.678 --> 57:13.680
but it's safe to say that ninja fever

57:14.014 --> 57:15.614
continues to spread throughout the city.

57:15.807 --> 57:18.143
Stay tuned for the weather,
followed by sports.

57:27.110 --> 57:27.611
See, you made it.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.405
Good work, Jack. I knew you could. Yay!

57:30.739 --> 57:31.899
Thank you for coming with me.

57:32.032 --> 57:33.241
I really do appreciate it.

57:33.575 --> 57:34.695
At your service. — oh, wow.

57:34.868 --> 57:36.453
Just look at you.

57:36.787 --> 57:37.947
Listen, I gotta run. — okay.

57:38.246 --> 57:39.566
I'll see ya back at the office,

57:39.831 --> 57:41.792
unless you want to take a shower together.

57:43.293 --> 57:44.878
Get outta here!

58:02.104 --> 58:03.104
Are you ready?

58:04.356 --> 58:06.108
Get close to him.

58:34.886 --> 58:38.515
Well done, sir.

58:59.244 --> 59:01.329
Surprise!

59:08.587 --> 59:10.172
Where do you think you're going?

59:13.300 --> 59:14.801
Get in there.

59:17.012 --> 59:19.890
Sit there, be a good girl,
and you won't get hurt.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.101
Ah, bitch.

59:26.021 --> 59:28.315
She's a cop, she's a cop!

59:28.648 --> 59:29.648
So what?

59:35.363 --> 59:37.616
Honey, you're so fucked.

59:44.706 --> 59:46.059
Thank you for meeting with me.

59:46.083 --> 59:47.667
What's this about?

59:48.001 --> 59:48.668
The man that you're after,

59:49.002 --> 59:50.879
the so—called plutonium killer,

59:51.213 --> 59:52.839
he's connected to the abductions

59:53.173 --> 59:54.853
that are taking place throughout the city.

59:55.008 --> 59:56.218
And how do you know this?

59:56.551 --> 59:58.345
Are you an informant?

59:58.678 --> 59:59.678
Interpol, actually.

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:02.009
I'm undercover, infiltrating

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:03.975
an international prostitution ring.

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:06.645
This plutonium killer you're
after is the ringleader.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:09.564
He's ex—cia, who became
an international criminal

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:11.709
after falling victim to
a government experiment

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:12.733
involving radiation.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.444
His only weakness is light.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:19.741
Why are you helping me?

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.160
Helping you?

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:24.454
Have you forgot about the women?

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:25.788
I'm helping them.

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.417
Have you seen today's paper?

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:33.630
Then you know this is
a much bigger problem.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:53.559
How long are we gonna wait?

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.694
Relax, just wait.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:58.738
We get that reporter first,
and then we can make our move.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:12.169
What the fuck you looking at?

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:22.053
Hey, isn't that
the guy from the park?

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.387
Let's follow him.

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:39.779
Hello?

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.574
Randi, listen, you have to meet me

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:44.910
in the park as soon as you can.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:46.369
It's important.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:00.842
Come on, John, this is so strange.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.637
Where could he be?

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:13.355
Hey, sweetheart, you
waiting for someone?

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:14.773
A friend, I suppose.

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:16.149
A friend?

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:18.068
That's real nice.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:22.239
Surprise, we're here.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:23.865
Switchblade.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:28.827
Come on, let's go.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.583
Come on! — get her, get her.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:37.253
Fuck!

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:39.046
Get me down!

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:47.055
Don't fucking move, ninja.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.418
You come any closer and I'll blow

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:50.474
her pretty face off.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:57.500
Come on, let's get outta here.

01:02:57.524 --> 01:02:58.566
Come on, move!

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:02.612
Get away! — come on.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.155
No, no!

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:09.952
Move it.

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.122
Let's go,
ladies, come on, inside.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.208
Come on, move it, ho! Inside.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:16.918
Come on, keep it moving.

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:18.252
Thh.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:22.132
Let go of me!

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.465
Shut up.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.600
Look at this pretty face.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:36.146
I'm gonna have fun with this one.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.859
See ya soon, baby.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.988
Come on, keep walking here.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:20.481
Well.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.527
What are you gonna do, now?

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:32.952
Can we talk?

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:34.286
Talk.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:45.172
What do you want?

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.470
It's about the missing women.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:51.804
I need your help.

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:56.351
I know who you are and
I think you can help me.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:00.271
I've got a problem.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:05.944
Well, remember when you first came to me?

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.572
I wanted to tell you that I found the guys

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:10.907
that killed your wife.

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:15.078
So, what's the problem?

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.079
It's the job.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.417
There are rules for me.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:24.087
The other day, I met with
this guy from Interpol.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:25.839
He wanted me to back off the case

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.257
and let them handle it.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.551
The problem is, they've got my partner.

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:32.719
That's your job.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:35.557
I wantjustice.

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:38.308
What?

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.564
But I need you to help me.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:43.897
Come on.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:49.154
I would, but my problem
is, you want them alive,

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.323
but I want them dead.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:05.961
It's for you.

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:16.014
We got the reporter.

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:18.725
I know, you really want her for yourself,

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:23.521
so you're gonna have to
pay extra. In person.

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:25.815
You know I don't show my face.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.484
I'll send my driver to meet you

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.819
under the bridge in an hour, understand?

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.863
You, in person,

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:33.357
or we keep her for ourselves.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:38.369
Fine, I'll meet you in an hour.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.308
Where's your boss?

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:45.979
I don't know.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.381
What do you mean you don't know?

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:50.210
He sent me alone.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.027
Don't fuck with me, asshole.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:57.573
Talk.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.995
I'll pistol whip you 'til you talk.

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:12.130
Put your
hands where I can see them.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.424
You asshole.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.886
Man, you are fucked.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.930
I think you may be
the ones that fucked up.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.225
Throw your guns in the back.

01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:29.731
I want the reporter.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.443
Now go!

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:34.902
Move it!

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:37.613
Hey, the ninjal — huh?

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:46.662
Huh?

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.542
What the hell?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:54.171
Don't you move or I will
blow your head off, asshole!

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:56.674
Get him.

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:15.193
Come on.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:22.492
Hey, asshole!

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:23.993
Get out of the car!

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:27.162
Get out of the fucking car!

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:28.581
Move it, asshole.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.296
You morons, you let him get away.

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.642
Don't just stand there! Go find him!

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.037
All right, we're going.
—you! Get the women

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.188
ready for transport.
— no problem.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.463
Let's go, ladies, keep moving.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:21.676
Come on, move it.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:46.743
Huh?

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:45.968
Don't move.

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.180
Back away from the women

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:51.182
and put your weapons on the ground.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.686
You're outgunned, asshole.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:58.814
Drop it.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:20.252
Drop it.

01:12:25.383 --> 01:12:26.634
I said, drop it.

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:29.469
I mean it.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.267
Pull a gun on me, asshole?

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.600
I should kill you!

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.106
Hey, he's a cop!

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:41.439
Shit!

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.693
Move it.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:54.078
Drunken sword style.

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:55.412
Bring it.

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.435
Huh?

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.411
What the hell?

01:14:58.744 --> 01:14:59.744
Hey, what happened?

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:48.377
Thank you.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:51.297
Detective, get the
other girls out of here.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.965
I'm gonna go free your partner.

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:05.519
Go, get outta here.

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:13.652
You're all free now! Get to safety!

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:16.614
Don't move, ninja.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:21.494
What the fuck?

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:22.870
Where the fuck did he go?

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:25.581
Find him, let's go!

01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:58.447
Hey, motherfucker.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.160
Keep going, come on.

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:05.746
Let's get out of here.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.456
Get up, don't stop.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:11.168
Go! Run!

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.676
Not so fast, baby.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:20.261
I'm not done playing yet.

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.974
Not so tough now, huh?

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.350
Get up!

01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.894
How about some head?

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.860
Ow, my eye!

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:37.820
Now I'm gonna cut you, bitch!

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:44.535
Are you okay?

01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:45.869
Come on.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:16.817
Is everyone okay?

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.151
Yea h, we're good.

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:19.402
Let's go.

01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:23.157
Everyone in the Van, let's move it.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.046
Where are the bad guys?

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:39.757
Am I the only one who found you?

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:41.175
Thank god, Jack.

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:44.094
Are you okay?

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:45.428
Come with me.

01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:47.640
Oh, look, it's the ninja.

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:52.436
Yea h, so what?

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:56.857
I don't have time for
that. Let's go, randi.

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:58.231
You're not Jack.

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:32.685
Get away, get away!

01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:48.909
You follow us and she's dead.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:58.794
Get in the car!

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:00.837
Get!

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.415
Come on, get out, come on!

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:21.168
Knock it off, let's go!

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:22.502
No, no!

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.423
Jesus, son of a bitch!

01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:27.757
Come on, let's go!

01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:34.765
What?

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:37.642
Huh?

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:54.511
We gotta get outta here.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.245
We got a pilot. —good.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.330
Let's move, come on.

01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:00.457
Yeah, faster, buddy. Let's go.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:05.855
Stay here
and take care of the ninja.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:07.548
The rest of you, let's move.

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:09.361
Come on, buddy.
— let's go, asshole.

01:22:10.634 --> 01:22:11.861
Come on, come on, move it!

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:13.387
Down the steps, now!

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.900
Get in, everyone in.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:29.945
Get us outta here. — inside.

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:31.572
Don't move, ninja.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:32.905
Put your hands up.

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:36.910
I said hands up!

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.664
Now, what are you gonna do?

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:45.794
A fan? You really think a
fan can stop these bullets?

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.351
Come on, get
this thing in the air.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:03.812
Let's go, come on, hurry, let's go.

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:06.272
What is it?

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.151
The gas tanks aren't full.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:12.196
Goddamn it!

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:20.412
Don't move.

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:28.085
Don't move.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:32.257
That's it, ninja.

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:18.428
What the hell?

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:56.967
You think you can stop me?

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:58.301
Just try it.

01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:11.523
You can't beat me, I'm immortal.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:13.650
I will defeat you.

01:25:13.984 --> 01:25:14.984
Drop it.

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:18.196
Huh?

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:19.698
Come on, let's go.

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:41.845
Get this thing in the air!

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:49.686
Come on, what's the hold up?

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.939
There's
something weighing us down.

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:55.251
It's that damn ninja!

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:56.275
Just fly!

01:25:58.445 --> 01:25:59.905
It'll kill him. —good!

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:03.158
Let's make a deal: You kill that ninja,

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:05.994
and I'll make you a rich man.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:07.328
Yes, sir.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:40.570
Ah, my face!

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:49.996
Get him out of here, toss him out!

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:53.166
Now get us out of here!

01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:57.921
What's that sound?

01:26:58.255 --> 01:26:59.255
Is that a bomb?

01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:17.274
Hey, don't move!

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:20.757
What took you guys so long?

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:23.447
Don't move, ninja.

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:32.831
Come on down, ninja.

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:36.001
I don't wanna have to shoot you.

01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:48.138
Slowly, no tricks.

01:28:15.415 --> 01:28:17.834
Let's find out who this guy is.

01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:19.294
Not just yet.

01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:23.632
We'll see his face soon
enough, if he has one.

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:30.263
Come on, guys!

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:48.573
Kid, come on.

01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:50.784
This is an active crime scene, all right?

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:53.245
Yeah, all right!

01:28:57.123 --> 01:29:00.794
Hey, wait. Wait! Where'd he go?

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.843
Well, that's it. We lost him.

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:19.104
You should head home.

01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:20.797
I'll take care of everything here.

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:22.983
Thanks, guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:38.832
Hey, John, did you hear?

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:39.666
Huh?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.480
They got the guys that killed nita.

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:44.504
I'm guessing this was because of you?

01:29:44.838 --> 01:29:48.425
It wasn't me, it was the New York ninja.

01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:49.758
Oh, yeah?

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:52.304

ninja's a real hero.
