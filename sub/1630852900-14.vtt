THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:38.566 --> 00:38.966
US.

00:39.033 --> 00:39.833
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER BUSY WEEK.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.366
BORIS JOHNSON NARROWLY SURVIVED

00:41.433 --> 00:42.433
A NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE, THE U.S.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.600
POSTAL SERVICE UNVEILED A NANCY

00:51.666 --> 00:52.166
ITS FIRST PRIME-TIME HEARING,

00:52.233 --> 00:52.633
PROMPTING A CRISIS FOR

00:52.700 --> 00:54.500
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA.

00:54.566 --> 01:01.833
FOX NEWS OPTED NOT TO AIR IT AT

01:01.900 --> 01:05.633
ALL, AND OAN WENT ONE BETTER,

01:05.700 --> 01:08.400
AIRING A TRIBUTE TO TRUMP

01:08.466 --> 01:10.000
INSTEAD, FEATURING THIS

01:10.066 --> 01:10.500
EXQUISITE TRANSITION TO

01:10.566 --> 01:11.233
COMMERCIALS.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.633

01:12.700 --> 01:13.300
MILLIONS AND SHOWN OUR NATION

01:13.366 --> 01:14.633
WHAT IT TRULY MEANS TO MAKE

01:14.700 --> 01:16.166
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

01:16.233 --> 01:17.100
FOR ONE AMERICA NEWS, I'M

01:17.166 --> 01:18.500
PEARSON SHARP.

01:18.566 --> 01:20.166
>> GENERIC VIAGRA DELIVERED

01:20.233 --> 01:21.166
WITHIN 48 HOURS IN DISCREET

01:21.233 --> 01:23.200
PACKAGING ON APPROVAL.

01:23.266 --> 01:26.166
NO ONE WILL KNOW BUT YOU.

01:26.233 --> 01:28.833
OH, AND YOUR MAILBOX.

01:30.100 --> 01:30.833
PERFECT.

01:30.900 --> 01:31.733
ABSOLUTELY NO NOTES.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.866
WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF,

01:34.933 --> 01:36.800
MAYBE SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THE

01:36.866 --> 01:37.766
MAILBOX THERE.

01:37.833 --> 01:38.733
IT JUST GOT GIVEN A RAGING FLAG

01:38.800 --> 01:39.433
BONER BY DISCREETLY PACKAGED

01:39.500 --> 01:40.366
PILLS, AND NOW IT JUST NEEDS TO

01:40.433 --> 01:41.133
SIT THERE FRUSTRATED AND HOPE

01:41.200 --> 01:43.666
FOR A PIGEON TO LAND JUST RIGHT.

01:45.100 --> 01:45.966
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START BY

01:46.033 --> 01:46.466
CHECKING IN ON THE

01:46.533 --> 01:47.700
MIDTERM ELECTIONS AGAIN.

01:47.766 --> 01:48.533
THIS TIME, IN ARIZONA, CURRENTLY

01:48.600 --> 01:49.166
REPRESENTED BY TWO DEMOCRATS IN

01:49.233 --> 01:50.133
THE SENATE.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.433
KYRSTEN SINEMA, THE ONLY

01:51.500 --> 01:52.400
SENATOR WHO SEEMS TO BUY ALL HER

01:52.466 --> 01:53.433
CLOTHES EXCLUSIVELY FROM

01:53.500 --> 01:56.833
GIRLBOSS PYRAMID SCHEMES.

01:57.833 --> 01:58.766
AND MARK KELLY, WHO'S UP FOR

01:58.833 --> 01:59.600
REELECTION.

01:59.666 --> 02:00.333
REPUBLICANS THINK THEY HAVE A

02:00.400 --> 02:01.400
REAL CHANCE OF UNSEATING HIM,

02:01.466 --> 02:02.166
WHICH HAS LED TO A COMPETITIVE

02:02.233 --> 02:03.433
PRIMARY.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.666
THE BEST-KNOWN CONTENDER IS

02:04.733 --> 02:05.933
PROBABLY MARK BRNOVICH,

02:06.000 --> 02:07.500
ARIZONA'S CURRENT AG, WHOSE

02:07.566 --> 02:08.466
WHOLE VIBE CAN PROBABLY BEST BE

02:08.533 --> 02:10.266
SUMMED UP BY THIS VIDEO HE

02:10.333 --> 02:11.733
RELEASED TO CELEBRATE THE END OF

02:11.800 --> 02:13.500
THE STATE'S BAN ON NUNCHUCKS,

02:13.566 --> 02:14.600
WHICH PROVED SO POPULAR, HE

02:17.033 --> 02:17.466
>> PEOPLE, YOU WANT MORE

02:17.533 --> 02:24.566
CHUCKS?

02:29.533 --> 02:30.733
I KNOW THAT'S

02:30.800 --> 02:31.900
RIDICULOUS, BUT I'M PERSONALLY

02:31.966 --> 02:32.866
ENJOYING DANNY McBRIDE'S NEWEST

02:32.933 --> 02:33.800
CHARACTER AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE

02:33.866 --> 02:38.466
WHERE HE GOES WITH IT.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.333
BUT BURNOVICH FACES RESISTANCE

02:39.400 --> 02:40.333
FROM DIE-HARD TRUMP SUPPORTERS,

02:40.400 --> 02:40.966
WHO FEEL HE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO

02:41.033 --> 02:41.833
TRY AND OVERTURN THE 2020

02:41.900 --> 02:42.433
ELECTION.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.333
WHICH HAS OPENED UP SPACE FOR

02:45.400 --> 02:49.000
CANDIDATES LIKE JIM LAMON,

02:49.066 --> 02:51.766
A RETIRED ENERGY EXECUTIVE WHO

02:51.833 --> 02:52.533
HAS MADE WAVES WITH THIS TV

02:53.700 --> 02:54.500
>> THE GOOD PEOPLE OF ARIZONA

02:54.566 --> 02:56.100
HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU.

02:56.166 --> 02:59.466
IT'S TIME FOR A SHOWDOWN.

03:04.166 --> 03:04.933
I'M JIM LAMON AND I APPROVE THIS

03:05.000 --> 03:07.233
MESSAGE.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.300
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T

03:08.366 --> 03:09.966
HAVE APPROVED IT, JIM, BECAUSE

03:10.033 --> 03:12.466
YOUR AD IS TERRIBLE.

03:12.533 --> 03:16.233
"SHIFTY KELLY" IS SUPPOSED TO BE

03:16.300 --> 03:17.266
MARK KELLY, WHO'S MARRIED TO

03:17.333 --> 03:17.966
GABBY GIFFORDS, WHO SURVIVED

03:18.033 --> 03:18.800
BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD IN 2011.

03:18.866 --> 03:19.833
SO SHOOTING AT HER HUSBAND IS,

03:19.900 --> 03:22.233
AT BEST, INSENSITIVE.

03:22.300 --> 03:23.400
IT'S FRANKLY AMAZING A GROWN MAN

03:23.466 --> 03:24.566
DRESSED IN A SHERIFF COSTUME

03:24.633 --> 03:25.633
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS

03:25.700 --> 03:27.566
DISCONTINUED BY PARTY CITY IS

03:27.633 --> 03:28.433
SOMEHOW JUST THE SECOND MOST

03:28.500 --> 03:30.700
DISTASTEFUL PART OF THAT AD.

03:30.766 --> 03:32.066
BUT SURPRISINGLY, TRUMP DIDN'T

03:32.133 --> 03:33.000
ENDORSE LAMON, EITHER.

03:33.066 --> 03:33.833
INSTEAD, HE'S ENDORSED

03:33.900 --> 03:35.766
BLAKE MASTERS.

03:35.833 --> 03:37.133
AND IF YOU THINK HIS NAME ALONE

03:37.200 --> 03:38.533
MAKES HIM SOUND LIKE A THIRD

03:38.600 --> 03:41.800
TIER BOND VILLAIN WAIT UNTIL YOU

03:41.866 --> 03:43.000
HEAR ABOUT HIS EVERYTHING

03:43.066 --> 03:44.100
ELSE.

03:44.166 --> 03:44.933
BECAUSE MASTERS IS A PETER

03:45.000 --> 03:45.900
THIEL-BACKED, SELF-DESCRIBED

03:45.966 --> 03:47.066
"CONSERVATIVE NATIONALIST."

03:47.133 --> 03:48.233
AND SINCE TRUMP'S ENDORSEMENT,

03:48.300 --> 03:49.700
THINGS HAVE STARTED TO SURFACE

03:49.766 --> 03:52.866
ABOUT HIM, LIKE THIS AUDIO, FROM

03:52.933 --> 03:55.266
A PODCAST THAT HE APPEARED ON

03:55.333 --> 03:56.066
BACK IN APRIL.

03:56.133 --> 03:56.700
>> WE DO HAVE A GUN VIOLENCE IN

03:56.766 --> 03:58.433
THIS COUNTRY AND IT'S GANG

03:58.500 --> 03:58.766
VIOLENCE.

03:58.833 --> 03:59.733
RIGHT?

03:59.800 --> 04:01.266
IT'S GANGS, IT'S PEOPLE IN

04:01.333 --> 04:06.433
CHICAGO, ST. LOUIS, SHOOTING

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
EACH OTHER.

04:08.566 --> 04:09.533
VERY OFTEN, YOU KNOW, BLACK

04:09.600 --> 04:10.533
PEOPLE, FRANKLY.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.100
OKAY, BLAMING BLACK

04:11.166 --> 04:12.266
PEOPLE FOR GUN VIOLENCE IN

04:12.333 --> 04:12.866
AMERICA IS JUST OUTRAGEOUSLY,

04:12.933 --> 04:14.333
UNCREATIVELY RACIST.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.266
BUT ALSO UNSURPRISING FROM

04:15.333 --> 04:16.100
SOMEONE WHO -- AND THIS IS

04:16.166 --> 04:17.466
TRUE -- WAS CALLED AN

04:17.533 --> 04:18.500
"IMMIGRATION PATRIOT" BY THE

04:18.566 --> 04:20.533
WHITE NATIONALIST WEBSITE

04:20.600 --> 04:21.666
V-DARE, WHICH PRAISED HIM,

04:21.733 --> 04:22.300
SAYING HE "CHECKS ALL THE RIGHT

04:22.366 --> 04:23.833
BOXES."

04:23.900 --> 04:25.066
AND "HE'S AN IMMIGRATION PATRIOT

04:25.133 --> 04:26.600
WHO CHECKS ALL THE WHITE

04:26.666 --> 04:27.966
SUPREMACIST BOXES" JUST ISN'T

04:28.033 --> 04:28.733
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT A

04:28.800 --> 04:30.566
MAN RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

04:30.633 --> 04:31.300
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR IT

04:31.366 --> 04:31.866
IN A "SEX AND THE CITY"

04:31.933 --> 04:33.333
VOICEOVER.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.433
THAT NIGHT, CHARLOTTE MET

04:35.500 --> 04:36.600
BLAKE, WHO WAS AN IMMIGRATION

04:36.666 --> 04:37.766
PATRIOT WHO CHECKED ALL THE

04:37.833 --> 04:39.533
BOXES, AND I COULDN'T HELP BUT

04:39.600 --> 04:40.233
WERE WE ALL JUST

04:40.300 --> 04:41.533
SEARCHING FOR OUR WHITE KNIGHT?

04:43.833 --> 04:46.033
MASTERS ALSO EMBRACES A NATIONAL

04:46.100 --> 04:49.100
ABORTION BAN, HAS QUESTIONED

04:49.166 --> 04:51.366
- WHETHER JANUARY 6
- TH WAS SET UP

04:51.433 --> 04:52.533
BY THE FBI.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.166
AND THEN THERE'S THIS INTERVIEW,

04:53.233 --> 04:54.100
IN WHICH HE CHOOSES THE EXACT

04:54.166 --> 04:55.766
WRONG ANSWER TO THE SOFTBALL

04:55.833 --> 04:56.566
QUESTION, "WHO'S A SUBVERSIVE

04:56.633 --> 04:57.700
THINKER WHO'S UNDERRATED?"

04:57.766 --> 04:59.733
>> SUBVERSIVE THINKER THAT'S

04:59.800 --> 05:00.033
UNDERRATED?

05:00.100 --> 05:04.033
>> YEAH.

05:04.100 --> 05:04.800
>> I'LL PROBABLY GET IN TROUBLE

05:04.866 --> 05:06.600
FOR SAYING THIS.

05:06.666 --> 05:08.566
I MEAN, I'D SAY, HOW ABOUT,

05:08.633 --> 05:09.200
LIKE, THEODORE KACZYNSKI?

05:09.266 --> 05:10.866
>> GOOD!

05:10.933 --> 05:13.900
GOOD ONE, ACTUALLY, YEAH.

05:13.966 --> 05:16.400
>> UH, PROBABLY NOT GREAT TO BE

05:16.466 --> 05:17.933
TALKING ABOUT THE UNABOMBER

05:18.000 --> 05:19.166
WHILE CAMPAIGNING.

05:20.266 --> 05:22.166
YEAH, PROBABLY NOT!

05:22.233 --> 05:23.100
ALSO, I'M SORRY, "THEODORE

05:23.166 --> 05:24.633
KACZYNSKI?"

05:24.700 --> 05:25.266
WHAT ARE YOU, HIS MOM WHEN HE'S

05:25.333 --> 05:27.433
IN TROUBLE?

05:27.500 --> 05:28.600
THEODORE JOHN KACZYNSKI, HAVE

05:28.666 --> 05:29.433
YOU BEEN SENDING MAIL BOMBS TO

05:29.500 --> 05:30.533
AIRLINES AND UNIVERSITIES AROUND

05:30.600 --> 05:31.433
THE COUNTRY FROM A REMOTE CABIN

05:31.500 --> 05:34.433
IN THE MONTANA WILDERNESS?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.633
YOU ARE SO GROUNDED, MISTER!

05:35.700 --> 05:38.000
NAUGHTY THEODORE!

05:39.466 --> 05:41.400
NOW, MASTERS INSISTS HE DOESN'T

05:41.466 --> 05:42.833
ENDORSE THE "BOMB" ASPECT OF THE

05:42.900 --> 05:44.533
UNABOMBER, WHICH WAS A PRETTY

05:44.600 --> 05:45.100
KEY PART OF HIS WHOLE DEAL.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.766
BUT UNSURPRISINGLY, JIM LAMON

05:46.833 --> 05:49.533
HAS NOW PRODUCED AN ATTACK AD

05:49.600 --> 05:50.733
FEATURING THAT AND MANY OTHER

05:50.800 --> 05:51.900
TERRIBLE THINGS MASTERS HAS

05:51.966 --> 05:52.600
SAID, AND HIS PUSHBACK TO THAT

05:52.666 --> 05:53.966
WAS FULL OF EVEN MORE RED FLAGS.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.666
>> LOOK, AS MY COMPETITORS

05:55.733 --> 05:56.900
SELF-DESTRUCT, I'M SURE THESE

05:56.966 --> 05:57.433
ATTACKS ARE ONLY GOING TO

05:57.500 --> 05:58.700
INCREASE.

05:58.766 --> 06:00.233
RIGHT, THEY'LL INTERVIEW MY

06:00.300 --> 06:00.833
CLASSMATES FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.700
THEY'LL PORE OVER WHATEVER I MAY

06:02.766 --> 06:03.600
HAVE WRITTEN AS A TEENAGER, TRY

06:03.666 --> 06:04.066
TO TWIST IT ALL OUT OF

06:04.133 --> 06:05.533
PROPORTION.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.500
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GET SUCKED

06:07.566 --> 06:08.266
INTO THAT KIND OF PETTY, DIRTY

06:08.333 --> 06:09.766
POLITICS.

06:09.833 --> 06:12.566
HOLY SHIT.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.300
"THEY'LL PORE OVER WHAT I MAY

06:14.366 --> 06:14.900
HAVE WRITTEN AS A TEENAGER" IS

06:14.966 --> 06:15.566
JUST NOT A NORMAL THING TO WORRY

06:15.633 --> 06:17.666
ABOUT.

06:18.466 --> 06:19.400
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "MY PETTY

06:19.466 --> 06:20.433
OPPONENTS WILL GO FROM DOG POUND

06:20.500 --> 06:21.366
TO DOG POUND, ASKING THE STAFF

06:21.433 --> 06:23.966
WHAT I MAY HAVE DONE WITH ALL

06:24.033 --> 06:24.366
THOSE STRAY DOGS.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.200
CLASSIC PETTY, DIRTY POLITICS."

06:26.266 --> 06:28.200
EXCEPT, NO, IT ISN'T, BLAKE!

06:28.266 --> 06:32.733
IT'S WEIRD, SPECIFIC POLITICS

06:32.800 --> 06:33.466
THAT WE NOW NEED TO KNOW A LOT

06:33.533 --> 06:34.900
MORE ABOUT.

06:34.966 --> 06:35.533
LOOK, THIS PRIMARY IS VERY MUCH

06:35.600 --> 06:36.433
UP IN THE AIR.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.400
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'LL

06:38.466 --> 06:38.866
GO TO NUNCHUCKS McGEE,

06:38.933 --> 06:39.766
THE WORLD'S MOST PATHETIC

06:39.833 --> 06:40.633
COWBOY, OR A GUY WHO LIKED THE

06:40.700 --> 06:41.300
UNABOMBER'S EARLIER, FUNNIER

06:41.366 --> 06:43.700
STUFF.

06:44.833 --> 06:45.666
WHAT WE DO KNOW, THOUGH, IS

06:45.733 --> 06:46.966
THINGS ARE GOING TO INTENSIFY IN

06:47.033 --> 06:47.933
ARIZONA OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF

06:48.000 --> 06:48.566
MONTHS, THAT THESE RESULTS COULD

06:48.633 --> 06:50.166
WELL SHIFT THE BALANCE OF POWER

06:50.233 --> 06:50.766
IN THE SENATE, AND THAT,

06:50.833 --> 06:52.000
CRUCIALLY, SOMEONE PROBABLY

06:52.066 --> 06:53.133
NEEDS TO INTERVIEW BLAKE MASTERS

06:53.200 --> 06:54.600
MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSMATES AS SOON

06:54.666 --> 06:55.566
AS POSSIBLE.

06:56.566 --> 07:01.133
AND NOW, THIS.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.633
AND NOW, SEAN

07:02.700 --> 07:05.233
HANNITY'S FAVORITE JOKE.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.333
>> TO COIN A PHRASE, WAS A TOTAL

07:08.400 --> 07:10.500
SCHIFF SHOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT I

07:10.566 --> 07:12.300
MEAN.

07:12.366 --> 07:16.766
>> WE CALL IT THE 2022 ADAM

07:16.833 --> 07:17.200
SCHIFF SHOW.

07:17.266 --> 07:18.266
>> CAPITOL HILL HAS DESCENDED

07:18.333 --> 07:21.666
INTO A ADAM SCHIFF SHOW.

07:21.733 --> 07:22.100
>> ADAM SCHIFF SHOW.

07:22.166 --> 07:26.300
>> THIS LATEST SCHIFF SHOW.

07:26.366 --> 07:33.100
>> A MOSCOW DOESN'T GIVE A ADAM

07:33.166 --> 07:34.966
SCHIFF ABOUT SANCTIONS.

07:35.033 --> 07:37.633
>> SPEAKING OF THEIR ADAM SCHIFF

07:37.700 --> 07:40.200
HOLE.

07:40.266 --> 07:43.333
>> BOMBED THE LIVING SCHIFF OUT

07:43.400 --> 07:43.633
OF ISIS.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.900
>> OF THAT IS TOTAL BULL-SCHIFF.

07:46.966 --> 07:51.133
>> TOTAL B.S., OR TOTAL B

07:51.200 --> 07:52.366
SCHIFF, ADAM SCHIFF.

07:52.433 --> 07:54.566
GUESS WHAT, SPOTIFY IS IN DEEP

07:54.633 --> 07:58.433
TROUBLE, OR ADAM SCHIFF, AS

07:58.500 --> 08:00.666
I CALL IT.

08:01.633 --> 08:02.633
MOVING ON.

08:02.700 --> 08:03.766
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:03.833 --> 08:04.400
THE INTERNET, A WORLD-CHANGING

08:04.466 --> 08:05.233
RESOURCE THAT WAS INITIALLY SOLD

08:06.266 --> 08:06.933
>> WE INSTALLED THE INTERNET ON

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
OUR COMPUTER JUST A SHORT TIME

08:08.066 --> 08:09.033
AGO AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

08:09.100 --> 08:10.433
GET THE KIDS OFF IT EVER SINCE.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.533
>> NOT ONLY DO THEY PLAY THE

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600
TYPICAL COMPUTER GAMES THAT ALL

08:12.666 --> 08:13.466
THE KIDS ENJOY, BUT THEIR

08:13.533 --> 08:14.800
CURIOSITY FOR LEARNING HAS

08:14.866 --> 08:16.166
SKYROCKETED.

08:16.233 --> 08:18.833
PETER IS CONSTANTLY QUOTING

08:18.900 --> 08:19.866
SPORTS STATISTICS, AND HE CAN

08:19.933 --> 08:20.766
TELL YOU THE BEST SURFING SPOTS

08:20.833 --> 08:22.166
AROUND THE GLOBE.

08:22.233 --> 08:22.933
>> NOT TO MENTION THE

08:23.000 --> 08:24.766
IMPROVEMENT IN PETER'S GRADES.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.933
AND DASHA'S, TOO.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
OKAY, FIRST, PETER WAS

08:28.066 --> 08:28.833
NOT CHECKING SURFING SPOTS OR

08:28.900 --> 08:31.800
SPORTS STATISTICS.

08:31.866 --> 08:34.766
PETER WAS MASTURBATING.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.200
THAT IS WHAT PETER WAS DOING.

08:38.266 --> 08:39.133
BUT SPARE A THOUGHT FOR DASHA

08:39.200 --> 08:40.333
THERE, WHO JUST GETS "ALSO GOOD

08:40.400 --> 08:40.566
GRADES."

08:40.633 --> 08:41.433
YOU DESERVE BETTER, DASHA.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.233
I HOPE YOU GREW UP TO BE AN

08:42.300 --> 08:43.000
EARLY INVESTOR IN CELLPHONES,

08:43.066 --> 08:43.900
MADE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND

08:43.966 --> 08:44.966
NEVER SPOKE TO YOUR WEIRD FAMILY

08:45.033 --> 08:45.766
EVER AGAIN.

08:45.833 --> 08:46.766
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

08:46.833 --> 08:47.933
TALK ABOUT THE FACT OUR

08:48.000 --> 08:48.733
EXPERIENCES ON THE INTERNET ARE

08:48.800 --> 08:50.066
NOW DOMINATED BY A VERY SMALL

08:50.133 --> 08:51.333
HANDFUL OF COMPANIES, WHO ARE

08:51.400 --> 08:52.233
GETTING PRETTY USED TO THROWING

08:52.300 --> 08:53.900
THEIR WEIGHT AROUND.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.933
IN 2020, THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

08:55.000 --> 08:56.300
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ANTITRUST

08:56.366 --> 08:57.933
RELEASED A MASSIVE

08:58.000 --> 08:59.466
450-PAGE REPORT DETAILING

08:59.533 --> 09:01.366
ANTICOMPETITIVE CONDUCT BY

09:01.433 --> 09:03.533
APPLE, AMAZON, FACEBOOK, AND

09:03.600 --> 09:04.466
ALPHABET -- THAT'S THE PARENT

09:04.533 --> 09:05.833
COMPANY OF GOOGLE.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.333
AND THE FINDINGS COULDN'T HAVE

09:07.400 --> 09:09.500
EACH PLATFORM

09:09.566 --> 09:10.566
SERVES AS A GATEKEEPER OVER A

09:10.633 --> 09:11.700
KEY CHANNEL OF DISTRIBUTION,

09:11.766 --> 09:13.166
ALLOWING THESE GIANTS TO PICK

09:13.233 --> 09:13.800
WINNERS AND LOSERS THROUGHOUT

09:13.866 --> 09:15.833
OUR ECONOMY.

09:15.900 --> 09:16.733
AND I KNOW, FOR SOME, THAT'S

09:16.800 --> 09:18.800
PART OF THE APPEAL.

09:18.866 --> 09:20.400
>> APPLE'S THE EMPIRE OF THE

09:20.466 --> 09:21.066
SMARTPHONE WITH ALL ITS

09:21.133 --> 09:22.333
ATTENDANT SERVICES.

09:22.400 --> 09:22.966
FACEBOOK IS THE REPOSITORY OF

09:23.033 --> 09:24.400
YOUR IDENTITY.

09:24.466 --> 09:25.333
AMAZON'S THE ONLINE WORLD

09:25.400 --> 09:27.066
BACKED BY CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE.

09:27.133 --> 09:27.633
AND ALPHABET IS ALL THINGS

09:27.700 --> 09:29.100
SEARCH.

09:29.166 --> 09:30.100
NOW, THESE COMPANIES HAVE ALL

09:30.166 --> 09:31.366
CREATED INCREDIBLE PRODUCTS THAT

09:31.433 --> 09:32.900
WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT.

09:32.966 --> 09:34.366
THEY ARE GARGANTUAN BUSINESSES

09:34.433 --> 09:35.466
THAT ARE, FOR THE MOST PART,

09:35.533 --> 09:38.066
LOVED AND RESPECTED BY THE MOST

09:38.133 --> 09:38.833
IMPORTANT PEOPLE, THEIR

09:38.900 --> 09:39.500
CUSTOMERS.

09:39.566 --> 09:40.566
ARE THEY MONOPOLISTS?

09:40.633 --> 09:41.733
I HONESTLY DON'T CARE!

09:41.800 --> 09:42.933
I DON'T!

09:43.000 --> 09:43.700
WAKE ME UP WHEN SOMEONE ELSE CAN

09:43.766 --> 09:46.333
DO IT BETTER!

09:46.400 --> 09:46.933
OKAY, THERE ARE A FEW

09:47.000 --> 09:47.766
PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

09:47.833 --> 09:51.300
FIRST, IN ORDER TO BE WOKEN UP,

09:51.366 --> 09:53.300
AT SOME POINT YOU DO NEED TO GO

09:53.366 --> 09:54.333
TO SLEEP, SOMETHING I FEEL LIKE

09:54.400 --> 09:55.100
JIM CRAMER -- A MAN WHO

09:55.166 --> 09:56.533
CONSTANTLY EXUDES BIG "RUNNING

09:56.600 --> 09:57.433
LATE TO MY CHILD'S THING"

09:57.500 --> 09:58.300
ENERGY -- HASN'T DONE IN THE

09:58.366 --> 10:00.133
LAST DECADE.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.066
BUT SECOND, A BIG THING THESE

10:01.133 --> 10:02.466
COMPANIES ARE ACCUSED OF DOING

10:02.533 --> 10:04.800
IS SUPPRESSING THEIR COMPETITION

10:04.866 --> 10:05.933
SO COMPLETELY THAT WE'D NEVER

10:06.000 --> 10:06.700
ACTUALLY KNOW IF SOMEONE ELSE

10:06.766 --> 10:07.866
COULD DO IT BETTER, BECAUSE

10:07.933 --> 10:08.866
THEY'LL NEVER GET A FAIR CHANCE

10:08.933 --> 10:10.033
TO TRY.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.000
THAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE.

10:12.066 --> 10:13.000
IT'S NOT THAT TECH COMPANIES ARE

10:13.066 --> 10:14.466
INHERENTLY BAD BECAUSE THEY ARE

10:14.533 --> 10:15.366
BIG -- IT'S THAT THEY'RE

10:15.433 --> 10:16.400
ENGAGING IN ANTICOMPETITIVE

10:16.466 --> 10:17.466
BEHAVIOR.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.800
AND HERE'S WHERE, UNUSUALLY, I

10:19.866 --> 10:20.800
MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE SOME GOOD

10:20.866 --> 10:21.466
NEWS.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.866
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO BILLS

10:24.933 --> 10:27.833
BEFORE CONGRESS RIGHT NOW WITH

10:27.900 --> 10:28.433
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THAT COULD

10:28.500 --> 10:29.033
CURTAIL AT LEAST SOME OF BIG

10:29.100 --> 10:29.966
TECH'S EXCESSES.

10:30.033 --> 10:30.866
BUT FOR REASONS WE'LL GET INTO

10:30.933 --> 10:32.133
LATER, IF THEY DON'T PASS IN THE

10:32.200 --> 10:32.866
NEXT MONTH OR SO, THEY'RE NOT

10:32.933 --> 10:35.300
LIKELY TO PASS AT ALL.

10:35.366 --> 10:36.800
SO, TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

10:36.866 --> 10:37.900
TECH MONOPOLIES, THE HIDDEN HARM

10:37.966 --> 10:38.733
THEY CAN DO, AND HOW BEST TO

10:38.800 --> 10:39.966
ADDRESS THAT.

10:40.033 --> 10:40.600
AND LET'S START WITH A TINY BIT

10:40.666 --> 10:42.933
OF HISTORY.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.766
BECAUSE IN THE PAST, THE U.S.

10:44.833 --> 10:45.600
HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN STRONG ACTION

10:45.666 --> 10:47.666
TO BREAK UP HARMFUL MONOPOLIES.

10:47.733 --> 10:48.400
- IN THE EARLY 20
- TH CENTURY, WE

10:48.466 --> 10:49.833
BROKE UP STANDARD OIL.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.100
AND AS RECENTLY AS 40 YEARS

10:51.166 --> 10:53.100
AGO, THE GOVERNMENT TOOK ACTION

10:53.166 --> 10:54.833
AGAINST, WHO ELSE, BUT AT&T, OUR

10:54.900 --> 10:56.333
BUSINESS DADDY WHO LEFT FOR

10:56.400 --> 10:58.733
CIGARETTES AND NEVER CAME HOME.

11:03.500 --> 11:08.866
THEY WERE ACTUALLY THE LARGEST

11:08.933 --> 11:13.400
FIRM ON THE PLANET, BACK THEN,

11:13.466 --> 11:14.000
AND BROADLY WELL-RESPECTED AND

11:14.066 --> 11:15.133
CONSIDERED GOOD.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.633
WHICH IS TO SAY, COMPLETELY

11:16.700 --> 11:17.266
UNRECOGNIZABLE FROM THE AT&T OF

11:17.333 --> 11:17.633
TODAY.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.800
BUT CRUCIALLY, THAT POPULARITY

11:18.866 --> 11:19.500
MAY WELL HAVE BEEN BECAUSE

11:19.566 --> 11:20.300
PEOPLE HAD NO ALTERNATIVES.

11:20.366 --> 11:21.333
YOU HAD TO RENT YOUR PHONE FROM

11:21.400 --> 11:22.400
AT&T, AND THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF

11:22.466 --> 11:23.533
BOTH LOCAL AND LONG-DISTANCE

11:23.600 --> 11:24.533
SERVICES, WHICH, AS WE NOW KNOW,

11:24.600 --> 11:25.900
WERE WILDLY OVERPRICED.

11:25.966 --> 11:27.433
AND WHEN MCI -- A MUCH SMALLER

11:27.500 --> 11:28.766
COMPANY -- TRIED TO OFFER

11:28.833 --> 11:29.766
LONG-DISTANCE PHONE SERVICE AT A

11:29.833 --> 11:30.966
LOWER RATE, AT&T WAS NOT HAVING

11:31.033 --> 11:32.533
IT.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.933
>> MCI, WHICH CHARGES UP TO 50%

11:35.000 --> 11:36.733
LESS THAN BELL, ARGUED THAT AT&T

11:36.800 --> 11:37.866
TRIED TO PUT IT OUT OF BUSINESS

11:37.933 --> 11:39.666
BY REFUSING TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT

11:39.733 --> 11:40.466
NEEDED FOR LONG-DISTANCE

11:40.533 --> 11:42.666
TRANSMISSION.

11:42.733 --> 11:45.166
AT&T'S OWN NOTES

11:45.233 --> 11:46.766
OF A 1972 FLORIDA MEETING BY

11:46.833 --> 11:48.733
COMPANY EXECUTIVES IN WHICH ONE

11:48.800 --> 11:50.066
SAID, "LET'S CHOKE THEM OFF

11:50.133 --> 11:54.366
BEFORE THEY GET STARTED."

11:54.433 --> 11:55.533
FUCK

11:55.600 --> 11:57.200
AT&T NOW AND FOREVER.

11:57.266 --> 11:59.766
BUT IS THAT WHAT THAT SAID?

11:59.833 --> 12:00.566
THE ONLY BITS OF SQUIGGLE I CAN

12:00.633 --> 12:03.433
DECODE THERE ARE THE WORDS,

12:03.500 --> 12:04.533
"DANGEROUS TO SAMANTHAS,"

12:04.600 --> 12:05.966
A DOLLAR SIGN, SOMETHING THAT

12:06.033 --> 12:06.766
WEIRDLY MIGHT BE COVID, AND

12:06.833 --> 12:07.800
THEN SOMETHING THAT'S

12:07.866 --> 12:08.666
DEFINITELY, NO QUESTION,

12:08.733 --> 12:11.566
CAPITAL-B "BALLS."

12:12.833 --> 12:16.533
THE DOJ THEN ACTUALLY FILED AN

12:16.600 --> 12:17.733
ANTITRUST LAWSUIT, WHICH AT&T

12:17.800 --> 12:18.666
FOUGHT VIGOROUSLY FOR A DECADE.

12:18.733 --> 12:19.200
AND WHEN, IN 1984, IT WAS

12:19.266 --> 12:20.466
FORMALLY BROKEN UP BY THE

12:20.533 --> 12:21.133
GOVERNMENT, AT&T'S CHAIRMAN

12:21.200 --> 12:22.433
WARNED THE PUBLIC THAT WE'D COME

12:22.500 --> 12:24.366
TO REGRET WHAT HAD JUST

12:24.433 --> 12:25.466
HAPPENED.

12:25.533 --> 12:28.366
>> OH, I'VE HAD THE CONVICTION

12:28.433 --> 12:30.900
AND TAKEN THE POSITION IN MORE

12:30.966 --> 12:32.100
THAN ONE FORUM THAT THE COUNTRY

12:32.166 --> 12:33.866
IN THE LONG RUN WILL BE SORRY.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.733
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO

12:35.800 --> 12:36.866
BELIEVE -- DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE

12:36.933 --> 12:39.033
THAT THINGS WILL WORK AS WELL IN

12:39.100 --> 12:40.566
THE FUTURE AS THEY HAVE IN

12:40.633 --> 12:49.600
THE PAST.

12:49.666 --> 12:51.800
YEAH, BUT HE WAS WRONG.

12:51.866 --> 12:53.066
THINGS ACTUALLY WORKED BETTER.

12:53.133 --> 12:53.866
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT, ENDING A

12:53.933 --> 12:55.033
MONOPOLY IS ALMOST ALWAYS A GOOD

12:55.100 --> 12:55.766
THING, WHETHER IT'S AT&T OR

12:55.833 --> 12:56.900
STANDARD OIL, OR LITERALLY ANY

12:56.966 --> 12:58.133
GAME OF MONOPOLY.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.133
WE DIDN'T KNOW IT AT THE TIME,

12:59.200 --> 13:00.066
BUT AT&T'S DOMINANCE WAS

13:00.133 --> 13:00.733
SERIOUSLY HOLDING BACK

13:00.800 --> 13:01.966
INNOVATION.

13:02.033 --> 13:03.166
BUT AS SOON AS IT WASN'T

13:03.233 --> 13:04.533
CONTROLLING THE PHONE LINES AND

13:04.600 --> 13:05.400
WHAT YOU COULD ATTACH TO ITS

13:05.466 --> 13:06.533
NETWORK, MANY NEW PRODUCTS

13:06.600 --> 13:07.233
STARTED PROLIFERATING, FROM THE

13:07.300 --> 13:08.900
ANSWERING MACHINE TO THE MODEM.

13:08.966 --> 13:10.333
THE BREAKUP OF AT&T WAS ACTUALLY

13:10.400 --> 13:12.466
A KEY STEP IN PRODUCING THE

13:12.533 --> 13:13.866
INTERNET REVOLUTION, GIVING US

13:13.933 --> 13:16.200
THE WEB AS WE NOW KNOW IT, AND

13:16.266 --> 13:17.566
PETER THE ABILITY TO LOOK UP

13:17.633 --> 13:23.000
SPORTS STATS, SURFING SPOTS,

13:23.066 --> 13:25.400
AND WHAT WE ALL KNOW HE WAS

13:25.466 --> 13:27.566
REALLY DOING THERE.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.666
THE POINT IS, WHEN HARMFUL

13:29.733 --> 13:30.666
MONOPOLIES END, INNOVATION

13:30.733 --> 13:31.266
FLOURISHES.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.333
AND I WANT YOU TO BEAR THAT IN

13:33.400 --> 13:33.866
MIND AS WE TALK ABOUT THE

13:33.933 --> 13:34.600
TECH

13:34.666 --> 13:35.766
COMPANIES.

13:35.833 --> 13:36.766
AND TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS

13:36.833 --> 13:37.866
ON JUST ONE WAY THEY USE THEIR

13:37.933 --> 13:39.600
MONOPOLY POWER, SOMETHING CALLED

13:39.666 --> 13:40.733
"SELF-PREFERENCING."

13:40.800 --> 13:41.466
IT'S WHERE COMPANIES UNFAIRLY

13:41.533 --> 13:42.833
FAVOR THEIR OWN PRODUCTS ON

13:42.900 --> 13:44.166
THEIR OWN PLATFORMS, WHICH HAVE

13:44.233 --> 13:44.900
BECOME SO BIG MOST OF US HAVE NO

13:44.966 --> 13:46.366
CHOICE BUT TO USE THEM.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.833
THIS IS A PARTICULARLY BIG

13:47.900 --> 13:48.900
PROBLEM WITH THESE THREE

13:48.966 --> 13:49.966
COMPANIES, AND WE'RE GOING TO

13:50.033 --> 13:52.000
START WITH APPLE.

13:52.066 --> 13:53.200
SPECIFICALLY, ITS APP STORE,

13:53.266 --> 13:54.133
WHICH IS BASICALLY THE ONLY

13:54.200 --> 13:54.933
PLACE TO DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE FOR

13:55.033 --> 13:56.666
YOUR iPHONE.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.933
WHICH IS ALREADY A LITTLE WEIRD

13:59.000 --> 14:00.366
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

14:00.433 --> 14:01.400
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ANY SOFTWARE

14:01.466 --> 14:02.733
YOU LIKE TO YOUR DESKTOP

14:02.800 --> 14:04.266
COMPUTER, BUT IF YOU HAVE AN

14:04.333 --> 14:06.000
iPHONE, APPLE HAS SET IT UP SO

14:06.066 --> 14:06.933
THAT ITS APP STORE IS THE ONLY

14:07.000 --> 14:09.266
GAME IN TOWN.

14:09.333 --> 14:11.933
AND APPLE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF

14:12.000 --> 14:12.566
UNFAIRLY PUSHING ITS OWN APPS TO

14:12.633 --> 14:13.500
THE TOP OF SEARCH RESULTS.

14:13.566 --> 14:15.066
THE COMPANY DENIES DOING THIS,

14:15.133 --> 14:16.633
BUT "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

14:16.700 --> 14:18.000
FOUND APPLE APPS THAT GENERATE

14:18.066 --> 14:19.100
REVENUE THROUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS OR

14:19.166 --> 14:20.966
SALES, LIKE MUSIC OR BOOKS,

14:21.033 --> 14:23.166
SHOWED UP FIRST IN 95% OF

14:23.233 --> 14:25.900
SEARCHES RELATED TO THOSE APPS.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.033
BUT REGARDLESS, PERHAPS MORE

14:28.100 --> 14:29.733
IMPORTANT IS THE STRANGLEHOLD

14:29.800 --> 14:31.033
APPLE HAS ON DEVELOPERS WHO WANT

14:31.100 --> 14:31.733
TO GET THEIR APPS ONTO YOUR

14:31.800 --> 14:33.400
PHONE.

14:33.466 --> 14:35.333
BECAUSE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO USE

14:35.400 --> 14:37.133
APPLE'S PAYMENT PROCESSOR, WHICH

14:37.200 --> 14:38.000
TAKES A HUGE PIECE OF EVERY

14:38.066 --> 14:39.733
DOLLAR THAT CUSTOMERS SPEND ON

14:39.800 --> 14:41.400
THOSE APPS AND ANY DIGITAL

14:41.466 --> 14:43.600
PURCHASES WITHIN THEM.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.900
>> APPLE TAKES A 30% COMMISSION

14:45.966 --> 14:46.633
ON SALES OF APPS AND IN-APP

14:46.700 --> 14:48.733
PURCHASES.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.566
SO, IF AN APP COSTS $4.99

14:51.633 --> 14:54.566
UPFRONT, APPLE COLLECTS $1.50.

14:54.633 --> 14:55.266
SAME GOES FOR IF YOU USE AN

14:55.333 --> 14:57.233
APP TO BUY DIGITAL GOODS, LIKE

14:57.300 --> 14:58.266
VIRTUAL WEAPONS, OR SIGN UP FOR

14:58.333 --> 14:58.833
A SUBSCRIPTION TO A MONTHLY

14:58.900 --> 14:59.933
SERVICE.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.233
IT'S TRUE.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.133
AND THAT WAS PRETTY SHOCKING TO

15:02.200 --> 15:03.533
ME.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.900
IT MEANS EVERY TIME SOMEONE

15:04.966 --> 15:06.500
SPENT MONEY ON THE JEREMY RENNER

15:06.566 --> 15:09.133
APP, SOMETHING REAL PEOPLE

15:09.200 --> 15:10.300
ACTUALLY DID, TO BOOST THEIR

15:10.366 --> 15:12.033
POSTS ABOUT HIM SO THEY COULD

15:13.333 --> 15:16.366
AGAIN, SOMETHING HUMANS

15:16.433 --> 15:16.933
WANTED -- IN AMOUNTS RANGING

15:17.000 --> 15:18.800
FROM $1.99 TO NEARLY 100 ACTUAL

15:18.866 --> 15:23.700
DOLLARS, APPLE GOT A CUT.

15:23.766 --> 15:24.733
AND THAT IS BLOOD MONEY RIGHT

15:24.800 --> 15:26.533
THERE.

15:30.066 --> 15:31.000
APPLE MAKES LITERALLY BILLIONS

15:31.066 --> 15:32.266
EVERY YEAR, JUST ON COMMISSIONS

15:32.333 --> 15:33.100
ON APP STORE PURCHASES.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.066
AND SOME APP DEVELOPERS HAVE

15:34.133 --> 15:35.233
TRIED TO FIND WAYS AROUND THIS.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.400
TINDER, FOR INSTANCE, CHARGES A

15:36.466 --> 15:37.000
HIGHER PRICE IF YOU SUBSCRIBE

15:37.066 --> 15:37.766
THROUGH THE APP THAN IF YOU DO

15:37.833 --> 15:38.900
IT ON THEIR WEBSITE.

15:38.966 --> 15:40.066
AND IF YOU OPEN NETFLIX ON YOUR

15:40.133 --> 15:41.033
iPHONE AND DON'T HAVE AN

15:41.100 --> 15:42.100
ACCOUNT, YOU GET A MESSAGE

15:42.166 --> 15:42.766
READING, "TRYING TO JOIN

15:42.833 --> 15:43.566
NETFLIX?

15:43.633 --> 15:44.900
YOU CAN'T SIGN UP FOR NETFLIX IN

15:44.966 --> 15:45.533
THE APP.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.066
WE KNOW IT'S A HASSLE.

15:47.133 --> 15:48.166
AFTER YOU'RE A MEMBER, YOU CAN

15:48.233 --> 15:50.000
START WATCHING IN THE APP."

15:50.066 --> 15:52.500
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY NETFLIX

15:52.566 --> 15:52.833
WOULD DO THAT.

15:52.900 --> 15:53.600
IT DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE A

15:53.666 --> 15:54.900
THIRD OF ITS SUBSCRIPTION

15:54.966 --> 15:56.166
REVENUE TO APPLE.

15:56.233 --> 15:57.466
IT NEEDS THAT MONEY TO PROMOTE

15:57.533 --> 15:59.266
ITS NETFLIX PRIDE MONTH

15:59.333 --> 16:05.566
COLLECTION!

16:05.633 --> 16:10.200
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT --

16:10.266 --> 16:10.866
SIMPLY SCROLL BY THE DOZEN

16:10.933 --> 16:11.866
STANDUP SPECIALS

16:11.933 --> 16:13.233
MOCKING THE TRANS COMMUNITY AND

16:13.300 --> 16:14.266
IT'S RIGHT THERE!

16:14.333 --> 16:15.166
SHINE WITH PRIDE, GUYS!

16:15.233 --> 16:16.200
AND WHILE APPLE WILL SAY IT'S

16:16.266 --> 16:17.166
LOWERED ITS COMMISSIONS FOR

16:17.233 --> 16:18.200
CERTAIN SMALL APP DEVELOPERS,

16:18.266 --> 16:19.366
AND NOW EVEN ALLOWS SOME APPS TO

16:19.433 --> 16:20.933
LINK TO AN EXTERNAL WEBSITE AND

16:21.000 --> 16:24.066
BYPASS COMMISSIONS, A KEY REASON

16:24.133 --> 16:25.866
THAT HAPPENED IS THAT THEY WERE

16:25.933 --> 16:27.466
PUT UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE, FROM

16:27.533 --> 16:28.166
LAWSUITS AND FROM REGULATORS

16:28.233 --> 16:29.333
OVERSEAS.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.933
AND IF YOU ARE THINKING,

16:31.000 --> 16:31.500
APPLE'S NOT THE ONLY GAME IN

16:31.566 --> 16:32.700
TOWN, WHAT ABOUT GOOGLE'S APP

16:32.766 --> 16:34.000
STORE?

16:34.066 --> 16:34.966
THEY CHARGE SIMILARLY HIGH

16:35.033 --> 16:36.333
COMMISSIONS TO DEVELOPERS.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.166
AND THE FACT IS, OVER 99% OF

16:37.233 --> 16:38.100
SMARTPHONES ARE PART OF EITHER

16:38.166 --> 16:39.766
GOOGLE'S OR APPLE'S APP

16:39.833 --> 16:43.600
ECOSYSTEM.

16:43.666 --> 16:44.433
LET'S ACTUALLY TALK A BIT ABOUT

16:44.500 --> 16:46.266
GOOGLE NOW.

16:46.333 --> 16:46.800
BECAUSE THEIR APP STORE IS

16:46.866 --> 16:47.366
CLEARLY ONLY A SMALL PART OF

16:47.433 --> 16:49.166
THEIR STORY.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.600
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW, THEY

16:50.666 --> 16:51.533
ABSOLUTELY DOMINATE ONLINE

16:51.600 --> 16:52.533
SEARCHES.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.766
>> LAST YEAR, GOOGLE

16:53.833 --> 16:54.833
CONDUCTED 90% OF THE WORLD'S

16:54.900 --> 16:55.733
INTERNET SEARCHES.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.466
WHEN BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ASKED

16:57.533 --> 17:00.333
TRILLIONS OF QUESTIONS, IT WAS

17:00.400 --> 17:00.833
GOOGLE THAT PROVIDED THE

17:00.900 --> 17:02.866
ANSWERS, USING COMPUTER

17:02.933 --> 17:04.933
ALGORITHMS KNOWN ONLY TO GOOGLE.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.500
>> THEY HAVE THIS PHRASE THEY

17:06.566 --> 17:07.466
USE, "COMPETITION IS JUST A

17:07.533 --> 17:09.800
CLICK AWAY."

17:09.866 --> 17:13.000
THEY HAVE NO COMPETITION.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.200
BING, THEIR COMPETITION, HAS 2%

17:14.266 --> 17:16.200
OF THE MARKET.

17:16.266 --> 17:21.400
THEY HAVE 90%.

17:21.466 --> 17:23.333
EXACTLY, PEOPLE USE

17:23.400 --> 17:24.500
GOOGLE TO THE EXTENT "GOOGLING"

17:24.566 --> 17:25.266
SOMETHING IS NOW A VERB.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.333
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT FOR ANY OTHER

17:26.400 --> 17:27.500
SEARCH ENGINE.

17:27.566 --> 17:29.000
NO ONE HAS EVER SAID "I'M GOING

17:29.066 --> 17:30.900
TO BING IT," EXCEPT FOR MAYBE

17:30.966 --> 17:31.933
BING CROSBY ANNOUNCING HE'S

17:32.000 --> 17:34.700
ABOUT TO MASTURBATE.

17:35.633 --> 17:37.233
BUT THAT'S IT!

17:37.300 --> 17:38.500
AND GOOGLE HAS EXPLOITED THEIR

17:38.566 --> 17:39.466
MARKET DOMINANCE IN SUBTLE WAYS,

17:39.533 --> 17:41.900
HAVING TO DO WITH THE SEARCH

17:41.966 --> 17:42.600
RESULTS THAT IT SHOWS YOU.

17:42.666 --> 17:43.233
BECAUSE IT USED TO BE, WHEN YOU

17:43.300 --> 17:44.100
GOOGLED SOMETHING, YOU GOT

17:45.366 --> 17:46.266
A SERIES OF BLUE LINKS TO

17:46.333 --> 17:47.433
VARIOUS PAGES ACROSS THE

17:47.500 --> 17:48.533
INTERNET THAT GOOGLE'S ALGORITHM

17:48.600 --> 17:49.166
HAD DETERMINED TO BE THE MOST

17:49.233 --> 17:50.233
RELEVANT.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.466
AND THAT WAS THE COMPANY'S GOAL

17:51.533 --> 17:52.233
AT THE TIME.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.800
AS ITS CO-FOUNDER LARRY PAGE

17:53.866 --> 17:56.166
SAID IN 2004, "MOST PORTALS SHOW

17:56.233 --> 17:57.033
THEIR OWN CONTENT ABOVE CONTENT

17:57.100 --> 17:58.300
ELSEWHERE ON THE WEB.

17:58.366 --> 17:59.333
WE FEEL THAT'S A CONFLICT OF

17:59.400 --> 18:00.700
INTEREST.

18:00.766 --> 18:02.466
WE WANT TO GET YOU OUT OF

18:02.533 --> 18:04.266
GOOGLE AND TO THE RIGHT PLACE AS

18:04.333 --> 18:06.500
FAST AS POSSIBLE."

18:06.566 --> 18:07.766
BUT WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR

18:07.833 --> 18:10.000
SOMETHING TODAY, YOU GET A LOT

18:10.066 --> 18:10.600
OF GOOGLE CONTENT BEFORE

18:10.666 --> 18:16.166
ANYTHING ELSE APPEARS.

18:16.233 --> 18:18.100
IN FACT, "THE MARKUP" FOUND

18:18.166 --> 18:20.433
GOOGLE DEVOTES 41% OF THE FIRST

18:20.500 --> 18:23.100
PAGE OF SEARCH RESULTS ON MOBILE

18:23.166 --> 18:25.333
DEVICES TO ITS OWN PROPERTIES

18:25.400 --> 18:28.500
AND WHAT IT CALLS "DIRECT

18:28.566 --> 18:29.933
ANSWERS" MEANING A USER WOULD

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
HAVE TO SCROLL NEARLY HALFWAY

18:32.066 --> 18:36.766
DOWN THE PAGE BEFORE REACHING

18:36.833 --> 18:37.400
THE FIRST ORGANIC RESULT IN THAT

18:37.466 --> 18:38.600
SEARCH.

18:38.666 --> 18:40.333
NOW, GOOGLE DISPUTES THEIR

18:40.400 --> 18:40.900
METHODOLOGY, BUT THINK ABOUT

18:40.966 --> 18:42.000
WHAT IT IS LIKE WHEN YOU SEARCH

18:42.066 --> 18:42.933
FOR SOMETHING.

18:43.000 --> 18:43.633
LET'S SAY YOU WANT TO LOOK UP

18:43.700 --> 18:44.566
DOLPHINS.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.200
SO YOU GOOGLE "DOLPHIN ANIMAL",

18:46.266 --> 18:46.800
AND YOU GET THIS, A BUNCH OF

18:46.866 --> 18:47.500
PICTURES OF DOLPHINS ON GOOGLE

18:47.566 --> 18:48.533
IMAGES.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.433
A BUNCH OF BUTTONS UP TOP LIKE

18:49.500 --> 18:50.600
"SOUNDS" THAT MOSTLY LEAD YOU

18:50.666 --> 18:51.933
TO VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE -- ALSO

18:52.000 --> 18:53.533
OWNED BY GOOGLE, BY THE WAY --

18:53.600 --> 18:55.066
A SECTION ON THE RIGHT SIDE

18:55.133 --> 18:55.800
THAT'S MOSTLY LINKS TO RELATED

18:55.866 --> 18:56.800
GOOGLE SEARCHES, LIKE "ORCA" OR

18:56.866 --> 18:57.733
"AMAZON RIVER DOLPHIN" AND

18:57.800 --> 18:58.633
A BOX OF DIRECT ANSWERS TO

18:58.700 --> 18:59.800
QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE ASKED

18:59.866 --> 19:00.700
ABOUT DOLPHINS, LIKE

19:00.766 --> 19:01.600
"WHAT ARE FIVE INTERESTING FACTS

19:01.666 --> 19:02.700
ABOUT DOLPHINS?" OR

19:02.766 --> 19:04.100
"IS DOLPHIN A FRIENDLY ANIMAL?"

19:04.166 --> 19:04.866
OR "CAN A DOLPHIN LOVE YOU?"

19:04.933 --> 19:06.033
AND WHILE YOU'VE NEVER EVEN

19:06.100 --> 19:07.000
THOUGHT OF THAT AS POSSIBILITY,

19:07.066 --> 19:08.400
SUDDENLY, YOU'RE CURIOUS.

19:08.466 --> 19:09.133
SO YOU CLICK ON IT, AND IT SAYS

19:09.200 --> 19:10.400
"DOLPHINS HAVE ALSO SHOWN LOVING

19:10.466 --> 19:11.566
EMOTIONS TOWARDS HUMANS."

19:11.633 --> 19:12.600
AND YOUR HEART KIND OF FLUTTERS

19:12.666 --> 19:13.400
FOR A MOMENT, WHO KNEW THAT

19:13.466 --> 19:14.600
THERE WAS ROOM IN A DOLPHIN'S

19:14.666 --> 19:17.000
HEART FOR LOVE?

19:17.066 --> 19:17.600
MAYBE THERE IS ROOM IN ONE FOR

19:17.666 --> 19:19.233
YOU?

19:19.300 --> 19:20.400
THEN YOU SEE MORE QUESTIONS LIKE

19:20.466 --> 19:21.000
"DO DOLPHINS PROTECT HUMANS?"

19:21.066 --> 19:22.066
WHICH THEY MUST, RIGHT?

19:22.133 --> 19:22.700
AFTER ALL, WE JUST LEARNED THEY

19:22.766 --> 19:25.366
CAN LOVE US.

19:25.433 --> 19:26.066
BUT THE ANSWER IS "THERE JUST

19:26.133 --> 19:27.666
ISN'T ANY RELIABLE EVIDENCE THAT

19:27.733 --> 19:28.766
IT'S TRUE."

19:28.833 --> 19:29.733
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:29.800 --> 19:30.400
THEY'RE WILLING TO LOVE, BUT NOT

19:30.466 --> 19:31.566
PROTECT US?

19:31.633 --> 19:32.400
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO THROW OUR

19:32.466 --> 19:35.966
LOVE AWAY?

19:36.033 --> 19:36.933
AND AS THE FEELING OF

19:37.000 --> 19:41.366
BETRAYAL CREEPS IN, YOU SEE THAT

19:41.433 --> 19:42.500
OTHERS HAVE SEARCHED "ARE

19:42.566 --> 19:43.300
DOLPHINS EVIL?"

19:43.366 --> 19:44.833
AND THE ANSWER IS, "DOLPHINS

19:44.900 --> 19:45.666
HAVE A HUGE CAPACITY FOR EVIL."

19:45.733 --> 19:47.466
WHICH, OF COURSE THEY DO.

19:47.533 --> 19:47.966
THEY'RE MONSTERS WITH NO

19:48.033 --> 19:48.600
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU MIGHT'VE

19:48.666 --> 19:49.266
OPENED UP TO THEM, FOR THE FIRST

19:49.333 --> 19:49.900
TIME IN A LONG TIME, AND THEY'D

19:49.966 --> 19:51.033
ABANDON YOU LIKE YOU'RE NOTHING?

19:51.100 --> 19:51.833
AND THEN YOU SEE "WHAT DO

19:51.900 --> 19:52.666
DOLPHINS THINK OF HUMANS?"

19:52.733 --> 19:53.700
AND YOU CAN BARELY EVEN BREATHE

19:53.766 --> 19:54.633
AS YOU OPEN THIS ONE, BUT YOU

19:54.700 --> 19:55.233
KNOW THE TRUTH BEFORE IT EVEN

19:55.300 --> 19:56.166
"DOLPHINS ARE

19:56.233 --> 19:57.333
ESSENTIALLY BRIBED WITH FISH TO

19:57.400 --> 19:59.600
INTERACT WITH HUMANS."

19:59.666 --> 20:00.766
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE HURT, AT

20:00.833 --> 20:01.400
LEAST YOU CAN ACCEPT THAT IT'S

20:01.466 --> 20:02.266
NOT ACTUALLY YOU, IT WAS NEVER

20:02.333 --> 20:04.466
YOU, IT WAS THE FUCKING DOLPHIN!

20:05.900 --> 20:07.466
AND THE POINT IS, THROUGHOUT

20:07.533 --> 20:08.200
THAT WHOLE EMOTIONAL

20:08.266 --> 20:09.966
ROLLERCOASTER, YOU NEVER EVEN

20:10.033 --> 20:12.033
LEFT GOOGLE!

20:12.100 --> 20:13.000
IN FACT, ONE ANALYSIS FOUND THAT

20:13.066 --> 20:14.200
TWO-THIRDS OF SEARCHES ON GOOGLE

20:14.266 --> 20:15.066
ENDED WITHOUT EVER CLICKING TO

20:15.133 --> 20:18.800
ANOTHER WEB PROPERTY.

20:18.866 --> 20:19.833
AND THE THING IS, INFORMATION

20:19.900 --> 20:22.300
THAT GOOGLE FEEDS YOU IN

20:22.366 --> 20:23.066
SEARCHES LIKE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

20:23.133 --> 20:24.100
COPIED FROM OTHER SOURCES,

20:24.166 --> 20:24.766
SOMETIMES WITHOUT THEIR

20:24.833 --> 20:25.600
KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT.

20:25.666 --> 20:26.700
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, WELL,

20:26.766 --> 20:29.000
IT'S FREE INFORMATION, WHY DOES

20:29.066 --> 20:29.900
IT MATTER IF I READ IT ON GOOGLE

20:29.966 --> 20:30.500
OR ON THE SITE THEY TOOK IT

20:30.566 --> 20:31.400
FROM?

20:31.466 --> 20:32.466
SITE TRAFFIC IS ONE OF THE MAJOR

20:32.533 --> 20:34.033
TOOLS THAT MANY WEBSITES,

20:34.100 --> 20:35.800
ESPECIALLY FREE ONES, USE TO

20:35.866 --> 20:37.366
SELL AD SPACE, SO TAKING AWAY

20:37.433 --> 20:38.566
VISITORS TO THEIR SITE IS

20:38.633 --> 20:39.833
ESSENTIALLY TAKING MONEY OUT OF

20:39.900 --> 20:41.666
THEIR POCKET.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.400
AND WHEN YELP EXPLICITLY REFUSED

20:43.466 --> 20:45.266
TO HAVE THEIR DATA SCRAPED,

20:45.333 --> 20:46.566
GOOGLE TOLD THEM THE ONLY WAY TO

20:46.633 --> 20:48.533
HAVE THEIR SITE'S CONTENT

20:48.600 --> 20:49.400
REMOVED WAS FOR IT TO BE REMOVED

20:49.466 --> 20:50.533
FROM GOOGLE'S GENERAL RESULTS

20:50.600 --> 20:52.033
ENTIRELY.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.700
AND AS THE CEO OF YELP EXPLAINS,

20:54.766 --> 20:55.766
THAT IS BASICALLY A DEATH

20:55.833 --> 20:56.933
SENTENCE.

20:57.000 --> 20:57.633
>> HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT FIRST

20:57.700 --> 20:59.133
PAGE?

20:59.200 --> 20:59.800
>> IT'S NOT EVEN JUST THE FIRST

20:59.866 --> 21:00.733
PAGE.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.100
IT'S THE FIRST FEW LINKS ON THE

21:03.166 --> 21:06.233
PAGE IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF

21:06.300 --> 21:07.100
WHERE USER ATTENTION GOES, AND

21:07.166 --> 21:08.700
WHERE THE TRAFFIC FLOWS.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.133
>> SO, IF YOU'RE NOT AT THE

21:10.200 --> 21:10.900
TOP OF THE PAGE, OR AT THE

21:10.966 --> 21:12.866
BOTTOM OF THE FIRST PAGE, OR ON

21:12.933 --> 21:13.766
THE SECOND PAGE, THAT'S GOING TO

21:13.833 --> 21:15.266
AFFECT YOUR BUSINESS?

21:15.333 --> 21:16.000
>> YEAH, IF YOU'RE ON THE SECOND

21:16.066 --> 21:16.866
PAGE, FORGET IT, YOU'RE NOT A

21:16.933 --> 21:20.100
REAL BUSINESS.

21:20.166 --> 21:21.133
EXACTLY.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.933
AND PUTTING THE MERITS OF YELP

21:23.000 --> 21:24.066
ASIDE, GOOGLE'S ALGORITHM

21:24.133 --> 21:24.900
SHOULDN'T DETERMINE WHETHER OR

21:24.966 --> 21:26.266
NOT SOMEONE'S BUSINESS IS REAL.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.800
FRANKLY, THAT DISTINCTION SHOULD

21:27.866 --> 21:28.733
ONLY BE WITHHELD IF SOMEONE'S

21:28.800 --> 21:30.000
BUSINESS INCLUDES THE WORDS

21:30.066 --> 21:31.133
"INSTAGRAM INFLUENCER."

21:31.200 --> 21:32.933
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT A JOB,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.366
YOU'RE NOT A BUSINESS, YOU'RE

21:34.433 --> 21:35.166
JUST ATTRACTIVE, INDEPENDENTLY

21:35.233 --> 21:36.900
WEALTHY, AND IT'S SUNNY OUTSIDE.

21:36.966 --> 21:37.500
THAT IS ALL THAT IS HAPPENING

21:37.566 --> 21:39.800
THERE.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.833
AND BEFORE JIM CRAMER SAYS "WHO

21:42.900 --> 21:43.466
CARES, BUILD A BETTER PRODUCT

21:43.533 --> 21:45.000
AND YOU'LL LAND ON THE FRONT

21:45.066 --> 21:49.500
PAGE," THE TOP RESULTS

21:49.566 --> 21:50.133
GOOGLE FEEDS YOU MAY NOT

21:50.200 --> 21:51.533
BE THE BEST ONES.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.266
TAKE GOOGLE FLIGHTS.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.500
IT USED TO BE, IF YOU GOOGLED

21:54.566 --> 21:55.333
"NYC TO BOISE," YOUR TOP RESULTS

21:55.400 --> 21:56.300
WOULD BE LINKS TO SITES LIKE

21:56.366 --> 21:57.200
THESE.

21:57.266 --> 21:58.566
BUT NOW, YOU'LL ALMOST ALWAYS

21:58.633 --> 22:00.533
GET THIS GOOGLE FLIGHTS WIDGET

22:00.600 --> 22:01.533
AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE, ALREADY

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
SET UP SO THAT YOU CAN CAN STAY

22:02.666 --> 22:04.333
ON GOOGLE AND FIND A FLIGHT

22:04.400 --> 22:06.333
WITHOUT CLICKING ANYWHERE ELSE.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.033
AND WHILE YOU, PERSONALLY, MIGHT

22:08.100 --> 22:08.666
SCROLL DOWN PAST THAT, MANY

22:08.733 --> 22:10.766
DON'T.

22:10.833 --> 22:12.600
AND THE INDUSTRY HAS FELT THIS.

22:12.666 --> 22:13.533
AS ONE TRAVEL ANALYST WROTE,

22:13.600 --> 22:15.066
"THE FACT THAT GOOGLE IS

22:15.133 --> 22:16.566
LEVERAGING ITS DOMINANCE AS A

22:16.633 --> 22:18.066
SEARCH ENGINE INTO TAKING MARKET

22:18.133 --> 22:18.833
SHARE AWAY FROM TRAVEL

22:18.900 --> 22:20.166
COMPETITORS IS NO LONGER EVEN

22:20.233 --> 22:22.633
DEBATABLE."

22:22.700 --> 22:23.633
AND GOOGLE MIGHT SAY THAT IT'S

22:23.700 --> 22:24.366
AT THE TOP BECAUSE IT'S THE

22:24.433 --> 22:28.433
BEST.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.000
BUT "THE MARKUP" FOUND GOOGLE

22:30.066 --> 22:31.633
FLIGHTS DID NOT ALWAYS DISPLAY

22:31.700 --> 22:32.633
THE CHEAPEST FARES, OR ALL

22:32.700 --> 22:33.633
AVAILABLE FLIGHTS.

22:33.700 --> 22:34.600
THOUGH I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS WHY

22:34.666 --> 22:36.066
GOOGLE FLIGHTS' BANNER IMAGE IS

22:36.133 --> 22:36.700
A WOMAN AND A CHILD HIKING

22:36.766 --> 22:38.766
SOMEWHERE WHILE POINTING AT AN

22:38.833 --> 22:40.400
AIRPLANE THAT THEY ARE NOT ON,

22:40.466 --> 22:41.300
SEEMINGLY SAYING, "WHAT THE

22:41.366 --> 22:42.200
FUCK?

22:42.266 --> 22:44.800
THERE ARE FLIGHTS HERE?

22:45.866 --> 22:46.600
GOOGLE TOLD US OUR BEST OPTION

22:46.666 --> 22:49.666
WAS TO WALK TO DENVER!"

22:49.733 --> 22:51.800
NOW, GOOGLE, LIKE APPLE, WILL

22:51.866 --> 22:53.933
QUIBBLE WITH A LOT OF WHAT I'VE

22:54.000 --> 22:54.200
JUST SAID.

22:54.266 --> 22:55.433
THEY'LL TELL YOU THEY SEND

22:55.500 --> 22:56.800
BILLIONS OF CLICKS OUTSIDE OF

22:56.866 --> 22:58.400
GOOGLE EVERY DAY, AND THAT THEY

22:58.466 --> 22:59.400
DON'T PREFERENCE GOOGLE FLIGHTS

22:59.466 --> 23:01.666
IN SEARCHES, WHICH...

23:01.733 --> 23:04.066
OKAY!

23:04.133 --> 23:05.733
OKAY, GOOGLE!

23:05.800 --> 23:10.066
THEY'LL ALSO TELL YOU

23:10.133 --> 23:12.000
YELP AND OTHER COMPANIES CAN NOW

23:12.066 --> 23:12.733
SELECT WHICH OF THEIR

23:12.800 --> 23:13.566
INFORMATION GETS SCRAPED, THOUGH

23:13.633 --> 23:14.800
THAT ONLY HAPPENED UNDER SERIOUS

23:14.866 --> 23:16.133
PRESSURE FROM THE FTC.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.233
AND IF YOU'RE NOTICING A THEME

23:17.300 --> 23:18.466
HERE THAT THESE COMPANIES ONLY

23:18.533 --> 23:19.333
DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN THEY'RE

23:19.400 --> 23:19.900
PUSHED UP AGAINST THE WALL,

23:19.966 --> 23:22.666
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT THE POINT.

23:22.733 --> 23:24.466
BUT ARGUABLY THE COMPANY MOST

23:24.533 --> 23:25.100
GUILTY OF SELF-PREFERENCING IS

23:25.166 --> 23:26.300
AMAZON, FOUNDED, OF COURSE, BY

23:26.366 --> 23:28.133
A MAN RICH ENOUGH TO BUY

23:28.200 --> 23:29.533
ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING, INCLUDING,

23:29.600 --> 23:30.066
SEEMINGLY, THE RIGHTS TO

23:30.133 --> 23:33.433
PITBULL'S IDENTITY.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.600
AMAZON REPORTEDLY CONTROLS

23:36.666 --> 23:37.766
65% TO 70% OF ALL U.S. ONLINE

23:37.833 --> 23:40.100
MARKETPLACE SALES.

23:40.166 --> 23:41.600
IT HOSTS ABOUT 2.3 MILLION

23:41.666 --> 23:45.233
ACTIVE THIRD-PARTY SELLERS FROM

23:45.300 --> 23:47.100
ALL AROUND THE WORLD, AND TO

23:47.166 --> 23:53.300
THOSE SELLERS, LIKE THIS MAN,

23:53.366 --> 23:55.633
WHO SOLD SPORTING GOODS, IT'S

23:55.700 --> 23:56.900
CLOSE TO THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN.

23:56.966 --> 23:58.266
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE ON AMAZON.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.466
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE, BECAUSE

23:59.533 --> 24:00.800
THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE IS.

24:00.866 --> 24:08.533
100 MILLION PRIME SUBSCRIBERS.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.800
>> THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE

24:11.866 --> 24:12.100
ARE OPTIONS.

24:12.166 --> 24:14.766
THERE IS WALMART, THERE IS ALLIE

24:14.833 --> 24:14.966
BABA.

24:15.033 --> 24:16.700
>> I'VE HEARD THAT RESPONSE FROM

24:16.766 --> 24:20.633
AMAZON EXECUTIVES BEFORE.

24:20.700 --> 24:23.300
AND WE DID THAT.

24:23.366 --> 24:24.466
>> WE LISTED ALL

24:24.533 --> 24:25.066
OF OUR PRODUCTS ON EVERY OTHER

24:25.133 --> 24:25.966
ONLINE MARKETPLACE.

24:26.033 --> 24:26.966
ALL OF THE OTHERS THAT WERE

24:27.033 --> 24:27.833
NON-AMAZON, COMBINED, DID ABOUT

24:27.900 --> 24:28.733
10% OF WHAT WE WERE DOING ON

24:28.800 --> 24:31.466
AMAZON.

24:31.533 --> 24:33.400
EXACTLY, AMAZON IS

24:33.466 --> 24:34.500
ESSENTIALLY THE ONLY PLACE TO

24:34.566 --> 24:35.366
SELL ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET,

24:35.433 --> 24:36.000
UNLESS, THAT IS, YOU'RE LOOKING

24:36.066 --> 24:36.866
TO OFFLOAD SOME HUMAN TEETH.

24:36.933 --> 24:37.433
THEN IT'S CRAIGSLIST ALL THE

24:37.500 --> 24:39.600
WAY, BABY!

24:40.666 --> 24:42.133
AND FOR A THIRD-PARTY SELLER,

24:42.200 --> 24:42.766
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE

24:42.833 --> 24:43.366
WORLD IS SOMETHING CALLED THE

24:43.433 --> 24:44.700
"BUY BOX."

24:44.766 --> 24:46.000
IT'S THAT LITTLE BOX THAT SHOWS

24:46.066 --> 24:46.800
UP ON ANY AMAZON PRODUCT PAGE,

24:46.866 --> 24:47.800
WHERE YOU CAN INSTANTLY CLICK TO

24:47.866 --> 24:48.800
BUY.

24:48.866 --> 24:49.766
SO WHEN WE SEARCHED FOR DURACELL

24:49.833 --> 24:51.766
AAA BATTERIES, WE GOT

24:51.833 --> 24:53.066
THIS PAGE, AND HERE'S THE BUY

24:53.133 --> 24:54.000
BOX, RIGHT HERE, WHERE WITH ONE

24:54.066 --> 24:54.633
CLICK, WE COULD BUY A PACK FOR

24:54.700 --> 24:56.500
$14.

24:56.566 --> 24:57.666
AND YOU MIGHT ASSUME THAT'S THE

24:57.733 --> 24:59.433
BEST DEAL, BUT IF YOU CLICK

24:59.500 --> 25:00.700
ON THIS LITTLE BOX BELOW, YOU

25:00.766 --> 25:01.700
CAN SEE MULTIPLE OTHER SELLERS

25:01.766 --> 25:03.566
WHO ARE OFFERING THE SAME

25:03.633 --> 25:06.900
PRODUCT, MANY AT A LOWER PRICE.

25:06.966 --> 25:07.766
THE PROBLEM IS, MOST PEOPLE

25:07.833 --> 25:09.533
AREN'T GOING TO SEE THAT,

25:09.600 --> 25:11.033
BECAUSE AN ESTIMATED 80% OF

25:11.100 --> 25:12.633
AMAZON SALES GO THROUGH THAT

25:12.700 --> 25:13.800
FIRST BUY BOX, AND IT'S EVEN

25:13.866 --> 25:15.766
MORE FOR MOBILE PURCHASES.

25:15.833 --> 25:19.966
BECAUSE IF WE'VE LEARNED

25:20.033 --> 25:22.766
ANYTHING SO FAR TONIGHT IT'S

25:22.833 --> 25:24.000
THAT NOBODY EVER, EVER WANTS TO

25:24.066 --> 25:25.433
SCROLL DOWN.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.700
SO OUT OF ALL THOSE SELLERS,

25:26.766 --> 25:27.466
ONLY ONE OF THEM GETS TO BE IN

25:27.533 --> 25:28.066
THAT BOX.

25:28.133 --> 25:28.800
AND NOBODY EXCEPT AMAZON KNOWS

25:28.866 --> 25:30.033
HOW ITS ALGORITHM PICKS THE

25:30.100 --> 25:33.866
WINNER.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.133
BUT IT SURE SEEMS TO

25:36.200 --> 25:36.766
CONSISTENTLY FAVOR AMAZON, WITH

25:36.833 --> 25:37.400
ONE ANALYSIS FINDING THE COMPANY

25:37.466 --> 25:38.466
CHOSE ITSELF FOR THE BUY BOX FOR

25:38.533 --> 25:39.366
ABOUT 40% OF PRODUCTS, WHILE THE

25:39.433 --> 25:40.666
NEXT HIGHEST SELLER GOT IT IN

25:40.733 --> 25:41.933
JUST HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF

25:42.000 --> 25:47.333
POPULAR PRODUCTS.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.433
AND EVEN WHEN THE BUY BOX DID

25:48.500 --> 25:53.033
GO TO A THIRD-PARTY SELLER,

25:53.100 --> 25:54.133
NINE OUT OF TEN TIMES, IT WENT

25:54.200 --> 25:55.333
TO THOSE THAT USED AMAZON'S

25:55.400 --> 25:56.000
SHIPPING SERVICE, FULFILLED BY

25:56.066 --> 25:58.600
AMAZON.

25:58.666 --> 25:59.500
BASICALLY, IT IS AMAZON'S

25:59.566 --> 26:00.833
PLAYGROUND, THEY MAKE THE RULES,

26:00.900 --> 26:01.500
AND THEY DO SEEM TO WIN A LOT OF

26:01.566 --> 26:02.433
THE TIME.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.466
AND AS THIS EXPERT POINTS OUT,

26:03.533 --> 26:04.333
IF THEY'RE COMPETING WITH YOU,

26:04.400 --> 26:04.966
YOU'RE BASICALLY DEAD.

26:05.033 --> 26:06.100
>> THIRD-PARTY SELLERS HAVE TOLD

26:06.166 --> 26:07.100
ME THAT ONCE THEY SEE THAT

26:07.166 --> 26:08.833
AMAZON IS SELLING THE SAME GOOD

26:08.900 --> 26:09.666
THAT THEY'RE SELLING, THEY

26:09.733 --> 26:11.766
LIQUIDATE THEIR INVENTORY.

26:11.833 --> 26:12.700
THEY KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

26:12.766 --> 26:13.433
COMPETE AGAINST AMAZON ON

26:13.500 --> 26:15.100
AMAZON'S OWN PLATFORM.

26:15.166 --> 26:17.466
OF COURSE.

26:17.533 --> 26:18.633
THINK ABOUT IT, OF COURSE IT IS.

26:18.700 --> 26:19.266
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

26:19.333 --> 26:20.533
AMAZON IS TO RETAILERS WHAT

26:20.600 --> 26:23.366
DOLPHINS ARE TO THE HUMAN HEART.

26:24.300 --> 26:27.000
IF THEY TAKE AN INTEREST IN YOU,

26:27.066 --> 26:27.566
YOU ARE GOING TO WIND UP

26:27.633 --> 26:28.566
DEVASTATED.

26:28.633 --> 26:31.133
FUCK YOU, FLIPPER!

26:32.200 --> 26:34.100
AND THE THING IS, AMAZON ISN'T

26:34.166 --> 26:34.800
JUST A MARKETPLACE OR INDEED A

26:34.866 --> 26:36.166
SHIPPING COMPANY, IT ALSO

26:36.233 --> 26:36.866
STARTED COMING UP WITH ITS OWN

26:36.933 --> 26:37.833
PRODUCTS NOW.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.700
BECAUSE IT CURRENTLY HAS

26:39.766 --> 26:45.800
APPROXIMATELY 158,000

26:45.866 --> 26:47.033
PRIVATE LABEL PRODUCTS ACROSS 45

26:47.100 --> 26:48.133
IN-HOUSE BRANDS.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.300
AND IT'S BEEN ACCUSED OF

26:50.366 --> 26:51.366
PREFERENCING THEM OVER ITS

26:51.433 --> 26:52.666
COMPETITORS -- OR EVEN WORSE,

26:52.733 --> 26:53.200
MAKING CLEAR KNOCKOFFS OF

26:53.266 --> 26:54.233
PRODUCTS THAT'VE BEEN

26:54.300 --> 26:54.833
SUCCESSFULLY SOLD ON ITS

26:54.900 --> 26:55.500
WEBSITE.

26:55.566 --> 26:56.633
TAKE A SMALL COMPANY CALLED

26:56.700 --> 26:58.000
PEAK DESIGN.

26:58.066 --> 26:59.133
IT MADE THIS CAMERA BAG, AND

26:59.200 --> 27:00.200
WHEN IT NOTICED A SUSPICIOUSLY

27:00.266 --> 27:01.233
SIMILAR BAG BEING SOLD BY

27:01.300 --> 27:04.400
AMAZON, IT MADE THIS PRETTY

27:04.466 --> 27:05.066
DECENT, SNARKY VIDEO IN

27:05.133 --> 27:07.066
RESPONSE.

27:07.133 --> 27:07.866
>> THIS IS THE EVERYDAY SLING BY

27:07.933 --> 27:09.500
PEAK DESIGN.

27:09.566 --> 27:10.533
AND THIS IS THE EVERYDAY SLING

27:10.600 --> 27:12.266
BY AMAZON BASICS.

27:12.333 --> 27:13.600
IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE

27:13.666 --> 27:15.533
THE PEAK DESIGN EVERYDAY SLING,

27:15.600 --> 27:16.833
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR

27:16.900 --> 27:18.566
ALL THOSE NEEDLESS BELLS AND

27:18.633 --> 27:19.833
WHISTLES, LIKE YEARS OF RESEARCH

27:19.900 --> 27:21.300
AND DEVELOPMENT, RECYCLED

27:21.366 --> 27:23.833
BLUESIGN-APPROVED MATERIALS, A

27:23.900 --> 27:25.633
LIFETIME WARRANTY, FAIRLY PAID

27:25.700 --> 27:27.133
FACTORY WORKERS, AND TOTAL

27:27.200 --> 27:28.900
CARBON NEUTRALITY.

27:28.966 --> 27:31.100
INSTEAD, YOU JUST GET A BAG

27:31.166 --> 27:32.300
DESIGNED BY THE CRACK TEAM AT

27:32.366 --> 27:34.866
THE AMAZON BASICS DEPARTMENT.

27:37.166 --> 27:39.833
YEAH, IT SURE SEEMS

27:39.900 --> 27:40.433
AMAZON IS PUTTING OUT A CHEAP

27:40.500 --> 27:41.066
COPY WITH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

27:41.133 --> 27:42.266
NAME AND DESIGN.

27:42.333 --> 27:43.533
AND IT'S PRETTY WEIRD THAT ONE

27:43.600 --> 27:44.833
OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE

27:44.900 --> 27:46.566
WORLD SEEMS TO BE USING THE SAME

27:46.633 --> 27:48.266
STRATEGY AS KNOCKOFF DVDs

27:48.333 --> 27:50.133
DESIGNED TO CONFUSE PARENTS.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.700
"HEY KIDS, WE GOT YOU THE MOVIES

27:51.766 --> 27:54.100
RATATOUILLE,

27:54.166 --> 27:55.133
TRANSMORPHERS, AND CHOP KICK

27:55.200 --> 27:58.466
PANDA!

27:58.533 --> 28:02.066
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

28:02.133 --> 28:04.366
IT'S WHAT YOU WANTED"

28:04.433 --> 28:05.233
AND AMAZON HAS A HUGE ADVANTAGE

28:05.300 --> 28:05.966
OVER ITS COMPETITORS, BECAUSE IT

28:06.033 --> 28:07.200
RUNS THE MARKETPLACE, AND HAS

28:07.266 --> 28:07.800
ACCESS TO ALL THE INDEPENDENT

28:07.866 --> 28:09.033
SELLER DATA -- LIKE,

28:09.100 --> 28:09.800
HYPOTHETICALLY, WHAT BAG IS

28:09.866 --> 28:11.333
PROVING POPULAR.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.800
AND LOOK, AMAZON DENIES THAT

28:12.866 --> 28:13.900
THEY PREFERENCE THEMSELVES,

28:13.966 --> 28:15.566
THEIR OWN PRODUCTS, OR SELLERS

28:15.633 --> 28:16.933
THAT PAY FOR THEIR LOGISTICS

28:17.000 --> 28:20.133
SERVICES.

28:20.200 --> 28:20.733
AND THEY ALSO DENY RIPPING OFF

28:20.800 --> 28:25.900
PRODUCTS BASED ON INTERNAL DATA,

28:25.966 --> 28:27.200
THOUGH WHEN JEFF BEZOS WAS ASKED

28:27.266 --> 28:28.033
ABOUT THAT DIRECTLY, HIS ANSWER

28:28.100 --> 28:30.066
WASN'T GREAT.

28:30.133 --> 28:31.133
>> LET ME ASK YOU, MR. BEZOS,

28:31.200 --> 28:32.233
DOES AMAZON EVER ACCESS AND USE

28:32.300 --> 28:33.200
THIRD-PARTY SELLER DATA WHEN

28:33.266 --> 28:34.333
MAKING BUSINESS DECISIONS?

28:34.400 --> 28:35.366
AND JUST A "YES" OR "NO" WILL

28:35.433 --> 28:36.366
SUFFICE, SIR.

28:36.433 --> 28:37.033
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION

28:37.100 --> 28:38.400
"YES" OR "NO."

28:38.466 --> 28:40.633
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS WE HAVE A

28:40.700 --> 28:41.800
POLICY AGAINST USING

28:41.866 --> 28:43.366
SELLER-SPECIFIC DATA TO AID OUR

28:43.433 --> 28:46.033
PRIVATE LABEL BUSINESS.

28:46.100 --> 28:46.866
BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU THAT

28:46.933 --> 28:47.966
THAT POLICY HAS NEVER BEEN

28:48.033 --> 28:49.900
VIOLATED.

28:49.966 --> 28:52.833
NOT GREAT, JEFF!

28:52.900 --> 28:53.666
"WE HAVE A POLICY BUT I CAN'T

28:53.733 --> 28:54.700
GUARANTEE YOU IT HASN'T BEEN

28:54.766 --> 28:56.600
VIOLATED" HAS GOTTA BE ONE OF

28:56.666 --> 28:57.300
THE MOST INCRIMINATING WAYS TO

28:57.366 --> 29:04.933
ANSWER A QUESTION.

29:05.000 --> 29:05.866
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH

29:05.933 --> 29:09.666
ANSWERING "DID YOU BREAK THE

29:09.733 --> 29:11.233
LAW?" WITH "WHICH LAW?"

29:12.500 --> 29:13.033
SELF-PREFERENCING STIFLES

29:13.100 --> 29:13.966
COMPETITION, HURTS SMALL

29:14.033 --> 29:14.866
BUSINESS AND OFTEN RESULTS IN

29:14.933 --> 29:16.600
SERVING CONSUMERS AN INFERIOR

29:16.666 --> 29:17.300
PRODUCT.

29:17.366 --> 29:18.466
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

29:18.533 --> 29:19.400
WELL, THAT BRINGS ME TO THE GOOD

29:19.466 --> 29:20.666
NEWS I MENTIONED EARLIER.

29:20.733 --> 29:21.733
BECAUSE THESE TWO BILLS ARE

29:21.800 --> 29:22.900
CURRENTLY BEFORE CONGRESS, AND

29:22.966 --> 29:23.433
WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE

29:23.500 --> 29:24.766
PROBLEMS YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT.

29:24.833 --> 29:25.400
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEY'D STOP

29:25.466 --> 29:27.066
MASSIVE COMPANIES THAT OPERATE

29:27.133 --> 29:28.866
APP STORES, LIKE APPLE AND

29:28.933 --> 29:30.300
GOOGLE, FROM REQUIRING

29:30.366 --> 29:31.533
DEVELOPERS TO USE THE COMPANY'S

29:31.600 --> 29:32.133
OWN IN-APP PAYMENT PROCESSOR,

29:32.200 --> 29:33.033
AND THEY'D BAN ADVANTAGING A

29:33.100 --> 29:34.100
PLATFORM'S OWN PRODUCTS,

29:34.166 --> 29:35.300
SERVICES, OR LINES OF BUSINESS

29:35.366 --> 29:36.466
OVER THOSE OF A RIVAL.

29:36.533 --> 29:37.300
AND UNSURPRISINGLY, TECH

29:37.366 --> 29:38.966
COMPANIES ARE FIGHTING THESE

29:39.033 --> 29:41.100
BILLS HARD, MAKING THE SAME

29:41.166 --> 29:42.666
ARGUMENTS THAT AT&T MADE 40

29:42.733 --> 29:44.400
YEARS AGO -- THAT IF YOU TAMPER

29:44.466 --> 29:45.733
WITH THEM, THINGS WON'T WORK AS

29:45.800 --> 29:46.333
WELL IN THE FUTURE AS THEY DID

29:46.400 --> 29:47.800
IN THE PAST.

29:47.866 --> 29:49.100
ALTHOUGH THIS TIME, THEY ALSO

29:49.166 --> 29:50.133
HAVE TRADE GROUPS RUNNING

29:52.766 --> 29:54.066
>> WASHINGTON IS FULL OF

29:54.133 --> 29:57.500
PROBLEMS, NOT SOLUTIONS.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.933
EVERY TIME THEY GET INVOLVED IN

30:00.000 --> 30:00.833
A NEW AREA OF OUR LIVES, THEY

30:00.900 --> 30:02.600
JUST SEEM TO MAKE THINGS WORSE.

30:02.666 --> 30:03.966
AND NOW, POLITICIANS ARE

30:04.033 --> 30:05.600
BOASTING ABOUT A PLAN TO CONTROL

30:05.666 --> 30:10.233
MY DEVICES AND HOW I USE THEM?

30:11.466 --> 30:12.733
THEIR SILLY IDEAS COULD RUIN

30:12.800 --> 30:13.633
SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT I RELY

30:13.700 --> 30:14.900
ON.

30:14.966 --> 30:16.133
IF I NEED DIRECTIONS, I SIMPLY

30:16.200 --> 30:17.166
CLICK ONE BUTTON AND IT GETS ME

30:17.233 --> 30:18.633
STRAIGHT TO WHERE I NEED TO GO.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.333
IN THEIR SEARCH FOR POPULARITY

30:20.400 --> 30:21.733
AND POWER, D.C. DOESN'T CARE

30:21.800 --> 30:22.366
WHETHER THEY MESS UP WHAT I NEED

30:22.433 --> 30:25.700
FROM THE INTERNET.

30:25.766 --> 30:27.566
FOCUS

30:27.633 --> 30:28.133
ON FIXING AMERICA'S REAL

30:28.200 --> 30:32.300
PROBLEMS.

30:32.366 --> 30:36.733
AND LEAVE MY PHONE ALONE.

30:37.733 --> 30:38.633
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH

30:38.700 --> 30:39.666
THAT UNSETTLING MAN?

30:39.733 --> 30:40.633
"FOCUS ON AMERICA'S REAL

30:40.700 --> 30:42.733
PROBLEMS, LIKE ME, AND WHATEVER

30:42.800 --> 30:43.333
MY DEAL IS, BECAUSE WHAT IS

30:43.400 --> 30:47.100
GOING ON WITH ME?

30:47.166 --> 30:51.733
WHAT'S THAT THING IN MY TRUCK?

30:51.800 --> 30:52.500
IS IT A TRASHCAN TAPED TO A

30:52.566 --> 30:53.466
DESK?

30:53.533 --> 30:54.333
A JABBA THE HUTT BARGE TAPED TO

30:54.400 --> 30:55.300
A CHIMNEY?

30:55.366 --> 30:56.333
ALSO, WHAT DID I JUST DO TO IT,

30:56.400 --> 30:56.700
AND WHY?

30:56.766 --> 30:58.266
MY BROADER POINT SEEMS TO BE I'D

30:58.333 --> 30:58.833
LIKE GOVERNMENT TO PAY LESS

30:58.900 --> 30:59.933
ATTENTION TO WHATEVER WEIRD SHIT

31:00.000 --> 31:00.566
THAT I'M DEFINITELY UP TO.

31:00.633 --> 31:01.200
BASICALLY, TO LEAVE MY PHONE AND

31:01.266 --> 31:02.333
WHATEVER OBVIOUSLY INCRIMINATING

31:02.400 --> 31:03.833
SHIT IS ON THERE ALONE, OR I

31:03.900 --> 31:04.233
WILL LUNGE AT YOU.

31:04.300 --> 31:04.800
I WILL LUNGE RIGHT AT YOU,

31:04.866 --> 31:07.066
WASHINGTON!

31:08.100 --> 31:09.733
THESE COMPANIES HAVE PUSHED SOME

31:09.800 --> 31:11.133
WILD ARGUMENTS, FROM CLAIMING

31:11.200 --> 31:12.066
THE BILLS WILL HELP CHINA, TO

31:12.133 --> 31:12.633
SAYING THEY'LL SOMEHOW HURT

31:12.700 --> 31:13.966
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

31:14.033 --> 31:17.000
AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO

31:17.066 --> 31:18.666
THROUGH EVERY BULLSHIT BOOGEYMAN

31:18.733 --> 31:19.433
THEY'VE COME UP WITH, BUT NONE

31:19.500 --> 31:20.066
OF THEM REALLY STAND UP, AND

31:20.133 --> 31:21.300
SOME HAVE FALLEN APART

31:21.366 --> 31:22.700
SPECTACULARLY.

31:22.766 --> 31:30.633
APPLE, FOR INSTANCE, CLAIMS THEY

31:30.700 --> 31:31.733
HAVE TO CONTROL THE APPS YOU

31:31.800 --> 31:32.866
CAN DOWNLOAD, OTHERWISE IT

31:32.933 --> 31:33.866
WOULD EXPOSE USERS TO SERIOUS

31:33.933 --> 31:34.733
SECURITY RISKS.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.466
IGNORING THE FACT THAT THESE

31:38.533 --> 31:39.800
BILLS HAVE EXPLICIT CARVEOUTS

31:39.866 --> 31:43.233
FOR THAT, IF APPLE COULD PROVE

31:43.300 --> 31:44.366
THOSE RISKS GENUINELY EXIST.

31:44.433 --> 31:45.733
AS FOR AMAZON AND GOOGLE,

31:45.800 --> 31:46.733
THEY'VE BEEN ARGUING SMALL

31:46.800 --> 31:47.566
BUSINESSES WOULD BE HARMED BY

31:47.633 --> 31:48.866
THESE BILLS, FUNDING LOBBYING

31:48.933 --> 31:49.633
GROUPS LIKE THIS ONE, THE

31:49.700 --> 31:50.300
CONNECTED COMMERCE COUNCIL,

31:50.366 --> 31:51.833
WHICH SUPPOSEDLY REPRESENTS

31:51.900 --> 31:52.900
5,000 SMALL BUSINESSES WHO

31:52.966 --> 31:54.800
ALL OPPOSE ANTITRUST REGULATION.

31:54.866 --> 31:55.433
BUT WHEN POLITICO REACHED OUT TO

31:55.500 --> 31:56.900
ITS MEMBERS, NEARLY ALL OF THE

31:56.966 --> 31:58.366
BUSINESSES IT CONTACTED SAID

31:58.433 --> 31:59.233
THEY'D NEVER HEARD OF THE

31:59.300 --> 32:01.533
CONNECTED COMMERCE COUNCIL.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.666
AND I DO GET WHY AMAZON, IN

32:04.733 --> 32:09.033
PARTICULAR, WOULDN'T HAVE FILLED

32:09.100 --> 32:11.200
THEM IN ABOUT IT, BECAUSE WHEN

32:11.266 --> 32:13.466
IT DIRECTLY ASKED ITS

32:13.533 --> 32:16.133
THIRD-PARTY SELLERS TO OPPOSE

32:16.200 --> 32:17.800
THESE BILLS, ONE OF THEM WROTE

32:17.866 --> 32:20.133
BACK, "ANY INFORMED SELLER IS

32:20.200 --> 32:21.966
GOING TO SUPPORT MASSIVE ACTION

32:22.033 --> 32:25.166
TAKEN AGAINST AMAZON IN THE

32:25.233 --> 32:25.566
ANTITRUST ARENA.

32:25.633 --> 32:26.333
WE ARE NOT MORONS AND KNOW

32:26.400 --> 32:27.766
HOW TO READ AND THINK FOR

32:27.833 --> 32:29.433
FOR OURSELVES."

32:29.500 --> 32:30.300
WHICH IS BASICALLY A POLITE WAY

32:30.366 --> 32:31.600
OF SAYING, "FUCK YOU AND

32:31.666 --> 32:32.400
THE SPACESHIP YOU RODE IN ON."

32:32.466 --> 32:33.266
THE TRUTH IS, THESE BILLS ARE

32:33.333 --> 32:34.633
NARROW -- ARGUABLY, TOO NARROW.

32:34.700 --> 32:35.333
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY

32:35.400 --> 32:36.800
HAVE BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

32:36.866 --> 32:43.666
BOTH BERNIE SANDERS AND JOSH

32:43.733 --> 32:44.966
HAWLEY WANT TO PASS THESE BILLS.

32:45.033 --> 32:46.700
THAT'S BASICALLY THE ONLY THING

32:46.766 --> 32:47.666
THEY HAVE IN COMMON.

32:47.733 --> 32:48.733
APART FROM THE FACT BOTH THEIR

32:48.800 --> 32:49.333
SMILES ARE EXCLUSIVELY UPPER

32:49.400 --> 32:51.466
TEETH, NO LIP.

32:51.533 --> 32:52.133
SO WHY HAVEN'T THE BILLS MOVED

32:52.200 --> 32:53.000
FORWARD?

32:53.066 --> 32:54.466
WELL, SOME BELIEVE IT DOESN'T

32:54.533 --> 32:55.400
HELP THAT AT LEAST 17 MEMBERS OF

32:55.466 --> 32:56.233
CONGRESS CURRENTLY HAVE CHILDREN

32:56.300 --> 32:57.466
WHO WORK OR HAVE RECENTLY WORKED

32:57.533 --> 32:58.700
FOR FOUR OF THE BIGGEST TECH

32:58.766 --> 32:59.800
COMPANIES, INCLUDING, CRUCIALLY,

32:59.866 --> 33:00.766
CHUCK SCHUMER'S DAUGHTERS, ONE

33:00.833 --> 33:01.833
OF WHOM WORKS AS A MARKETING

33:01.900 --> 33:03.533
MANAGER AT META, AND ONE OF WHOM

33:03.600 --> 33:04.700
IS A LITERAL REGISTERED LOBBYIST

33:04.766 --> 33:07.266
FOR AMAZON.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.100
AND THE REASON THAT IS

33:08.166 --> 33:15.133
INTERESTING IS BECAUSE

33:15.200 --> 33:17.800
CHUCK SCHUMER IS THE PERSON WHO

33:17.866 --> 33:18.933
NEEDS TO CALL THESE BILLS TO A

33:19.000 --> 33:19.733
VOTE.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.866
AND WHILE HE HAS CERTAINLY SAID

33:20.933 --> 33:21.966
HE'LL DO THAT, HE HASN'T DONE IT

33:22.033 --> 33:22.700
YET, AND IF HE DOESN'T DO IT

33:22.766 --> 33:23.666
BEFORE CONGRESS LEAVES FOR ITS

33:23.733 --> 33:24.700
AUGUST RECESS, THE BILLS ARE

33:24.766 --> 33:25.300
PROBABLY DEAD, BECAUSE IN THE

33:25.366 --> 33:25.966
FALL, EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE

33:26.033 --> 33:27.266
MOVED ON TO FOCUSING ON THE

33:27.333 --> 33:28.933
MIDTERM ELECTIONS, WHERE AS WELL

33:29.000 --> 33:31.466
ALL KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS WILL BE

33:31.533 --> 33:32.333
ABSOLUTELY ANNIHILATED.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.166
SO WE HAVE A VERY SMALL WINDOW,

33:33.233 --> 33:35.866
RIGHT NOW, TO ACTUALLY DO

33:35.933 --> 33:37.033
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.933
AND IF ANY PART OF YOU IS

33:39.000 --> 33:40.566
THINKING, WHO CARES?

33:40.633 --> 33:42.533
THINGS BASICALLY WORK FINE FOR

33:42.600 --> 33:43.800
ME RIGHT NOW.

33:43.866 --> 33:44.733
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING, PEOPLE

33:44.800 --> 33:45.766
THOUGHT THINGS WORKED FINE WITH

33:45.833 --> 33:47.300
AT&T BEFORE THEY WERE BROKEN UP,

33:47.366 --> 33:48.200
BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY DIDN'T

33:48.266 --> 33:49.166
KNOW WHAT THEY WERE MISSING.

33:49.233 --> 33:50.133
THE PROBLEM WITH LETTING A FEW

33:50.200 --> 33:56.333
COMPANIES CONTROL WHOLE SECTORS

33:56.400 --> 33:57.633
OF THE ECONOMY IS THAT IT LIMITS

33:57.700 --> 33:58.266
WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR STARTUPS BY,

33:58.333 --> 33:59.100
IF I MAY QUOTE AT&T'S

33:59.166 --> 34:00.300
INCOHERENT MEMO, "CHOKING THEM

34:00.366 --> 34:00.866
BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN GET

34:00.933 --> 34:02.600
STARTED."

34:02.666 --> 34:04.133
AN INNOVATIVE APP, OR WEBSITE,

34:04.200 --> 34:05.433
OR PRODUCT, MIGHT NEVER GET OFF

34:05.500 --> 34:06.900
THE GROUND, BECAUSE IT COULD BE

34:06.966 --> 34:08.100
SURCHARGED TO DEATH, BURIED IN

34:08.166 --> 34:09.333
SEARCH RESULTS, OR RIPPED OFF

34:09.400 --> 34:11.433
COMPLETELY.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.066
THESE BILLS WOULD CRACK THE DOOR

34:13.133 --> 34:14.700
BACK OPEN FOR INNOVATION, AND

34:14.766 --> 34:16.733
NUDGE THE INTERNET BACK TOWARD

34:16.800 --> 34:18.866
WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FROM

34:18.933 --> 34:20.266
A REVOLUTIONARY TOOL

34:20.333 --> 34:21.400
THAT EXPANDS GLOBAL ACCESS TO

34:21.466 --> 34:23.733
INFORMATION, AND THE ABSOLUTE

34:23.800 --> 34:24.733
BEST PLACE TO RESEARCH SURFING

34:24.800 --> 34:26.533
SPOTS.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.866
GET YOURS, PETER.

34:27.933 --> 34:30.100
GET YOURS.

34:31.200 --> 34:36.200
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

34:36.266 --> 34:37.266
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

34:37.333 --> 34:37.966
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

34:38.033 --> 34:40.700
GOOD NIGHT!
