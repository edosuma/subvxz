00:01.306 --> 00:02.838
You know what?
I think I'm getting the hang

00:02.913 --> 00:05.296
of this whole traveling
between realities thing.

00:05.371 --> 00:07.518
- Old hat.
- That makes one of us!

00:11.530 --> 00:14.645
It's just like swimming, Miles.
Let the current guide you.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.120
Oh, yeah, 'cause I love swimming,

00:17.195 --> 00:20.055
except through the very
fabric of reality.

00:20.623 --> 00:23.354
See that? It's a shard
from the Siege Perilous.

00:23.429 --> 00:26.018
It lets us travel through
dimensions. Problem?

00:26.093 --> 00:30.012
<i>The other shards like it scattered into
who knows how many other realities.</i>

00:30.087 --> 00:33.828
<i>But if we don't reassemble them soon,
every world will collapse in on itself.</i>

00:33.903 --> 00:37.304
Which is a fancy way of saying, "Boom!
End of the universe."

00:37.379 --> 00:39.255
Oh, but there's one more problem.

00:39.337 --> 00:43.938
So, any clue who that Wolf Spider
was that wants this shard so badly?

00:44.013 --> 00:45.598
Never seen him in my life,

00:45.673 --> 00:47.757
but he did know my secret identity.

00:47.832 --> 00:49.502
Let's just hope we don't
cross his path again.

00:49.577 --> 00:53.586
At the rate we're going, who knows what
kind of apocalyptic nightmare reality

00:53.661 --> 00:55.083
we're about to be dumped into.

the crystal blue ocean.

01:28.024 --> 01:32.585

No. Wait. I mean, there's only
one way off of this island.

02:16.104 --> 02:19.083
The hard way!
And Coco here agrees.

02:19.158 --> 02:22.467
It's not a deserted island
if you're here, Coco.

02:24.219 --> 02:26.607
Is he talking to a coconut?

02:27.139 --> 02:31.018

You look just as cool as I imagined.

Look, I can explain everything.

03:05.502 --> 03:09.272
We're from another dimension and, well,
we need to get a shard of a special gem

03:09.347 --> 03:12.301
before all the different

that was the king's English,

03:17.037 --> 03:19.331

"Blah, blah, blah, gem!"

03:37.010 --> 03:38.680
Okay.

we don't want your treasure.

Were you trying to keep all
the treasure for yourself?

04:01.660 --> 04:04.730
That's not the point!
They betrayed me!

04:04.805 --> 04:07.780
If you were hoarding the
treasure, you betrayed them too.

Who's telling this story, me or you?
I be the victim here! Ha!

04:11.954 --> 04:15.254
Eh, doesn't matter. I escaped

we're gonna be forced to take it.

than Web Beard here.

you build a boat

but that doesn't sound right.

11:27.260 --> 11:29.560
If it's a fight
you're looking for, stranger,

11:29.690 --> 11:31.320
you take it up with my deputy...

11:33.630 --> 11:35.901
The Phantom Rider.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.425
Boys, time for a strategic retreat.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.600
- (WHISTLES)

11:46.680 --> 11:48.410
Come on, now! Hightail it!

11:49.340 --> 11:50.480
(BOTH GRUNT)

11:52.310 --> 11:53.610
THE WEB-SLINGER: Hurry up and move.

11:53.685 --> 11:56.450
He catches up with you, you're
gonna have a very bad day.

11:59.690 --> 12:02.660
There's three of us and one of him.
I think we could take him.

12:02.735 --> 12:06.385
Think again. No one ever
stopped the Phantom Rider.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.560
Best we can do is make for the desert.

12:08.635 --> 12:11.430
So, uh, what did you do
to cause all this?

12:11.505 --> 12:12.870
Me?

12:12.945 --> 12:17.240
Doc Ock Holiday seized control of the
whole town by taking out the last sheriff.

12:17.315 --> 12:19.365
Since then he rules with an iron fist.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.410
Then someone needs to stand up to him.

12:21.485 --> 12:23.175
Easier said than done.

12:23.250 --> 12:27.275
With the Phantom Rider by his
side, Doc's untouchable.

12:27.350 --> 12:28.580
I think we lost him.

12:28.655 --> 12:30.145

12:58.140 --> 13:01.692
How about we talk this
one through, civilized-like?

13:02.450 --> 13:05.334
This game of cowboys
and Spiders is over.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.505
Eat Arachno-Blast!

13:12.330 --> 13:15.507
Nothing? But that move
took down the Goblin!

13:15.630 --> 13:19.425
(GROANS)

13:19.500 --> 13:23.495
The shard! Glowing?
This makes no sense.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.105

13:25.684 --> 13:26.564
Whoa.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.305
(GASPING)

13:29.380 --> 13:31.945

Come on, guys!

(GROANS)

13:43.630 --> 13:44.744
(GROANS)

13:44.880 --> 13:48.150
I had the weirdest dream, where... Oh.

13:49.260 --> 13:52.020
Miles, wake up. I think
we're in the hoosegow.

13:52.393 --> 13:53.600
Did I use that word right?

13:53.675 --> 13:54.824
(GROANS)

13:55.213 --> 13:57.500
Hey! My web-shooters are gone!

13:57.575 --> 13:59.310
Mine too. Look.

14:00.580 --> 14:03.210
Our fragment of the Siege
Perilous is in my shooter,

14:03.285 --> 14:06.273
and it glowed when I was close
to the Phantom Rider.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.210
What's the story with that?

14:08.285 --> 14:10.915
Let's find out.
Old-timey jail? Heh.

14:10.990 --> 14:14.190
No problem for Spider Strength...
Ah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

14:14.420 --> 14:17.297
- Ha!
- Electrified bars.

14:17.372 --> 14:18.780
My own invention.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.225
You don't get to be sheriff
by being no fool.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.931
Can't say the same for whatever
you two are supposed to be.

14:26.270 --> 14:28.169
Circus performers, maybe?

14:28.370 --> 14:30.075
Here comes the gloating.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.435
Different universe, same Ock.

14:32.510 --> 14:35.102
And that ain't my only
invention, neither.

14:35.210 --> 14:39.002
I have yet to unveil the fruits
of my latest experiments.

14:39.077 --> 14:42.420
- (EXPLOSION)
- Huh? Honestly. This infernal town.

14:42.495 --> 14:45.350
It's always something.
You boys stay put.

14:45.425 --> 14:48.048
Ha! As if y'all could go anywhere.

14:51.330 --> 14:53.430
I've seen enough Westerns
to know, that explosion?

14:53.505 --> 14:56.330
- Just a distraction for...
- THE WEB-SLINGER: A jailbreak.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.430
(GRUNTS)

15:02.300 --> 15:03.588
You abandoned us.

15:04.140 --> 15:07.170
Whoa, whoa, settle down,
Arachnid the Kid.

15:07.245 --> 15:09.105
That's "Kid Arachnid."

15:09.180 --> 15:09.695
(CHUCKLES)

15:09.770 --> 15:11.505
I didn't abandon anyone.

15:11.580 --> 15:15.505
I made a strategic retreat
so I could rescue you later.

15:15.580 --> 15:18.480
It didn't make a lick of sense
for all three of us get caught.

15:18.555 --> 15:21.419
Time for round two with Ock
and his talkative goon.

15:23.490 --> 15:27.185
I didn't bust you out to watch
you get thrown back in.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.988
But someone needs to stand up to Ock.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.600
I don't know what it's like
where you're from,

15:30.675 --> 15:33.804
but around here,
an honest man can't win.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.265
My Old Uncle Ben was the last sheriff.
Real good guy.

15:38.340 --> 15:41.270
He went up against Ock
and was never seen again.

15:41.345 --> 15:44.185
If Ben couldn't lick him, no one can.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.210
- DOC OCK HOLIDAY: He's right, you know.
- (GASPS)

15:48.220 --> 15:51.215
I know what y'all came for.

15:51.290 --> 15:53.245
The piece of
the Siege Perilous we need!

15:53.320 --> 15:55.460
Oh, that what it's called?
I didn't rightly know.

15:55.535 --> 15:58.155
But you ain't the first ones
to come after it.

15:58.230 --> 16:00.490
A masked man calling himself
the Wolf Spider

16:00.565 --> 16:04.260
come 'round not too long ago,
but I run him out of town.

16:04.335 --> 16:08.275
You, however, I'll simply destroy.

16:10.610 --> 16:13.319
Now I do regret breaking you out.

16:13.510 --> 16:15.525
You are the worst Spider-Man.

16:19.835 --> 16:21.265
(GRUNTING)

16:23.135 --> 16:26.523
Ah! Not my shooting hand!

16:26.974 --> 16:30.714
Being a hero, boys...
Not for me. I'm gone.

16:30.873 --> 16:32.539
You can't run away from a battle!

16:34.783 --> 16:37.008
Is running away what Uncle Ben
would've wanted you to do?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.077
Well, he ain't here to ask, is he?

17:32.825 --> 17:34.790
We thought you abandoned us again.

17:34.865 --> 17:36.930
What you said about
Old Uncle Ben was right.

17:37.005 --> 17:40.264
He'd want me to fight
to the end. So here I am.

17:40.479 --> 17:41.999
Don't matter none.

17:42.074 --> 17:44.728
Just another Spider to squash.

Ock, this ain't how we do things
around here, and you know it.

17:48.213 --> 17:50.588
I demand a shoot-out.

17:50.843 --> 17:54.907
If I win, the strangers go,
and you free the town.

17:54.982 --> 17:57.807
Ha. And if I win?

I have you at my mercy already?

I got a Doc Ock of my own.

backs down from a fight!
