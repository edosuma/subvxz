02:47.349 --> 02:49.181
<i>The most common electron donor</i>

02:49.183 --> 02:51.450
<i>along the vents is
hydrogen sulfide,</i>

02:51.452 --> 02:54.420
<i>making oxidation

02:54.422 --> 02:57.193
<i>the base of the food

02:57.392 --> 03:00.160
<i>The microorganisms

03:00.162 --> 03:02.294
<i>or reducing sulfur compounds</i>

03:02.296 --> 03:04.264
<i>show amazing diversity.</i>

03:04.266 --> 03:09.703
<i>Over 161 gram-negative
sulfur-oxidizing bacteria species</i>

03:09.705 --> 03:13.096
<i>have been found to inhabit
the hydrothermal vents.</i>

03:13.098 --> 03:17.577
<i>Bacteria in this environment are often
thought of as all being autotrophs,</i>

03:17.579 --> 03:20.614
<i>but of these 161 species,</i>

03:20.616 --> 03:24.420
<i>over 97% are also capable
of heterotrophic growth.</i>

03:24.686 --> 03:28.221
<i>In addition, 37% perform
fermentation.</i>

03:28.223 --> 03:31.490
<i>Furthermore, the sulfate
reducers known to be present,</i>

03:31.492 --> 03:36.031
<i>include at least nine different
genera, including gram-negative...</i>

03:36.297 --> 03:37.766
Yeah, I see.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.535
I understand why.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.772
No, to us it'd make
a huge difference.

03:45.273 --> 03:46.475
She'll be out soon.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.074
You had enough?

03:49.076 --> 03:51.514
<i>While most are rod shaped...</i>

03:53.648 --> 03:56.952
They want us on the boat
now for a team debriefing.

03:57.218 --> 03:59.020
Can I get
in the tank next time?

03:59.254 --> 04:00.223
That's dangerous.

04:00.421 --> 04:02.055
Each suit is designed
specifically

04:02.057 --> 04:02.992
for each aquanaut, so...

04:03.219 --> 04:05.327
Thank you, Paul, but you don't
have to indulge her every whim.

04:05.593 --> 04:06.995
Thank you, Paul.

04:08.563 --> 04:09.998
Why do you torture
him like that?

04:11.332 --> 04:13.068
He's too young
to defend himself.

04:18.106 --> 04:19.108
I'll race you.

04:19.940 --> 04:21.575
- No.
- Come on now.

04:21.577 --> 04:23.146
No, I... I...

04:24.947 --> 04:26.048
I don't like you!

04:28.183 --> 04:32.518
Okay, I just want to
go over the order of the dives,

04:32.520 --> 04:34.453
so that you can
communicate with each other

04:34.455 --> 04:35.924
about who can help log,

04:36.224 --> 04:39.162
as some of you will be prepping
and not available to log.

04:39.394 --> 04:40.296
All right?

04:40.462 --> 04:45.301
We start from here,
so Jonas and René are up first,

04:45.500 --> 04:47.534
- Lucky you.
- with Étienne as the pilot,

04:47.536 --> 04:49.839
for the first dive
in the Cadiz Gulf.

04:50.037 --> 04:53.006
Then we're going to
hug the coastline,

04:53.008 --> 04:56.075
going west of Ireland
and Britain

04:56.077 --> 04:57.679
into the Norwegian Sea.

04:58.212 --> 05:00.650
There, Gustavo and
Maria are next,

05:01.015 --> 05:04.953
with Frank piloting
around the Faroe Island.

05:05.453 --> 05:09.722
Frank, who is also taking
Annie and Mark down,

05:09.724 --> 05:14.029
here near Iceland where
we'll spend the most time,

05:14.229 --> 05:16.328
and do several dives, okay?

05:16.330 --> 05:17.797
It's a complete reversal,
I'm sorry.

05:17.799 --> 05:19.698
And then, our deepest dive,

05:19.700 --> 05:23.806
Thumbs and Dani,
are last, around Jan Mayen,

05:24.171 --> 05:26.508
with Étienne as a pilot, okay?

05:33.614 --> 05:36.618
There are definite
advantages in going last.

05:37.719 --> 05:40.490
They're gonna be logging
and not prepping,

05:41.423 --> 05:42.992
and the sub will be tested.

05:43.592 --> 05:45.260
I'm not thinking about that.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.630
Then what's up?

05:48.664 --> 05:50.967
I realized I've never
been lonely before.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.039
Welcome to the planet.

05:59.741 --> 06:01.840
It's possible there's
no service where he is.

06:01.842 --> 06:03.979
He's working in
Northern Kenya, right?

06:04.546 --> 06:06.182
Or he just stopped calling,

06:07.849 --> 06:09.381
stopped being interested.

06:09.383 --> 06:10.452
Impossible.

06:10.719 --> 06:12.518
He's just stuck somewhere
without reception.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.755
For a month.

06:14.155 --> 06:15.156
Yes.

06:16.024 --> 06:17.159
Why not?

06:51.292 --> 06:53.728
Don't go near him, boy!

08:41.434 --> 08:42.671
Next.

08:43.538 --> 08:46.375
<i>The Monk by the Sea is not...</i>

08:55.750 --> 08:58.386
<i>...The Berlin Academy
exhibition of 1810.</i>

09:07.763 --> 09:08.998
What do you got for us?

09:10.799 --> 09:12.498
I have a bona fide source,

09:12.500 --> 09:15.270
willing to give up an
operational bomb unit in Europe.

09:16.538 --> 09:17.870
They want to hit train stations.

09:17.872 --> 09:18.937
Where's the link?

09:18.939 --> 09:20.540
In Southern Somalia.

09:20.542 --> 09:21.874
What's on the
table for the source?

09:21.876 --> 09:23.710
British passport,
we want him.

09:23.712 --> 09:25.110
We found him,
we'll get him.

09:25.112 --> 09:26.779
He's my source,
so I'm going in alone.

09:26.781 --> 09:28.748
Somalia is not a good idea, J.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.052
I know.

09:30.684 --> 09:31.886
Check this out.

09:42.063 --> 09:44.766
We are talking about
bombs all over Europe.

09:45.033 --> 09:48.368
<i>If there's even a chance we can get out
in front of that, we have to take it.</i>

09:48.370 --> 09:50.405
We don't know who they are,
where they are.

09:51.005 --> 09:52.906
Their whole pipeline
of intelligence

09:52.908 --> 09:54.810
and soldiers waiting
to stream in.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.080
You don't even know what faction
is in charge in Kismayo right now.

09:58.313 --> 10:01.250
Well, I was hoping you could help
me out with who's in charge there.

10:02.683 --> 10:06.054
Oh, come on, James,
this isn't Afghanistan.

10:06.688 --> 10:08.223
<i>So, how are you getting in?</i>

10:08.756 --> 10:10.159
Small plane.

10:10.925 --> 10:13.395
I'll use my water
engineer alias.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.466
I'll meet my contact
at Kismayo airport.

10:17.665 --> 10:21.069
So, you're mister water expert
and you're gonna dig up some wells?

10:23.471 --> 10:26.004
<i>In the tooth again,
that's the safest.</i>

10:26.006 --> 10:28.240
Yeah, I'll activate it
once I'm there.

10:28.242 --> 10:29.377
Same as last time.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.419
Don't let them
know you speak Arabic, J.

10:37.619 --> 10:38.687
Guys, do me a favor,

10:38.953 --> 10:40.955
just tell me something
that's gonna help me, would you?

10:42.023 --> 10:43.092
Fuck.

10:47.962 --> 10:50.165
Yeah? Okay.

10:52.167 --> 10:54.466
<i>Wait, we've got
something for you.</i>

10:54.468 --> 10:55.503
<i>Look at the picture.</i>

10:56.871 --> 10:59.308
<i>You must remember this guy,
Yusef Mohamud al-Afghani.</i>

11:01.275 --> 11:02.377
Yeah.

11:03.645 --> 11:06.081
He was with Osama in 2001,
wasn't he?

11:06.313 --> 11:08.614
<i>Yeah,
apparently he's in Somalia now.</i>

11:08.616 --> 11:11.452
<i>We'll get you intel on him,
whatever we dig up.</i>

11:12.120 --> 11:15.524
<i>Give us a few days, J, we'll
contact you on a safe line.</i>

11:59.266 --> 12:00.365
Hey!

12:00.367 --> 12:03.371
Hi. You came yourself.

12:03.571 --> 12:05.975
For you,
Madame Flinders, of course.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.510
Oh, so good to be back.

14:03.357 --> 14:04.559
Evening.

14:04.925 --> 14:06.160
What kind of whiskey
do you have?

14:06.428 --> 14:08.027
I've got a good Japanese one.

14:08.029 --> 14:10.099
<i>Konnichiwa,</i> let's go Japanese.

14:13.201 --> 14:15.437
- You play rugby?
- I used to.

14:15.636 --> 14:17.573
- What's your name?
- Marcel.

14:17.938 --> 14:19.238
Why did you stop, Marcel?

14:19.240 --> 14:21.273
Oh, you know,
I just broke my neck.

14:21.275 --> 14:23.676
Stick that on room 12, please.

14:23.678 --> 14:25.179
- Okay.
- See you later.

14:36.757 --> 14:38.426
Your white wine, Madame.

14:39.693 --> 14:41.429
Thank you, Marcel.

15:18.533 --> 15:19.568
Hey.

15:20.834 --> 15:22.336
Good Morning.

15:26.174 --> 15:27.443
Good Morning.

15:28.076 --> 15:31.246
- You're English?
- British. Scottish British.

15:31.612 --> 15:33.912
Dani, Dani Flinders.

15:33.914 --> 15:35.284
James More.

15:37.684 --> 15:40.521
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah, I'd like that!

15:58.939 --> 16:00.275
Oh.

16:07.582 --> 16:09.617
I think you're following me.

16:12.486 --> 16:15.223
Or you're following
me in advance.

16:16.024 --> 16:17.926
Tricky.

16:18.358 --> 16:20.292
Mr. More,
the newspaper you wanted.

16:20.294 --> 16:21.796
Thank you, Beatrice.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.667
You're definitely following me.

16:27.669 --> 16:29.704
I haven't even had a
chance to shower yet.

16:29.904 --> 16:31.807
I love the smell of sweat.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.778
- I have to do some work.
- Is this your room?

16:37.946 --> 16:41.080
- Lunch?
- Would 1:30 be too late?

16:41.082 --> 16:42.351
No.

17:11.778 --> 17:13.678
<i>Free-living chemoautotrophic</i>

17:13.680 --> 17:15.982
<i>microorganisms at
hydrothermal vents.</i>

17:15.983 --> 17:20.618
<i>We integrated the analyses of IPL
diversity and delta13C values,</i>

17:20.621 --> 17:24.223
<i>delta13C lipid with
16S RNA gene-based...</i>

17:34.435 --> 17:36.171
Yes?

17:36.771 --> 17:38.473
<i>I've come
to take you to lunch.</i>

17:39.607 --> 17:40.939
It's open.

17:55.089 --> 17:56.592
Carry on, Professor.

17:58.258 --> 18:00.261
How did you know
I was a professor?

18:00.861 --> 18:03.564
I looked at your name on the
letter you picked up this morning.

18:07.101 --> 18:08.736
What are you a professor of?

18:09.903 --> 18:11.272
Take a guess.

18:13.006 --> 18:14.173
Um...

18:14.175 --> 18:15.777
Music?

18:16.009 --> 18:17.642
Nope.

18:17.644 --> 18:19.844
Do you mind turning
it down a little bit?

18:19.846 --> 18:21.082
It's awfully loud in here.

18:21.349 --> 18:23.882
I mean, you couldn't
really hear me...

18:23.884 --> 18:25.553
knock on the door even, so...

18:27.721 --> 18:30.791
- Thank you, Law?
- Please.

18:31.225 --> 18:33.762
- Uh, anthropology?
- Wrong again.

18:34.128 --> 18:35.961
Well, just... tell me then.

18:35.963 --> 18:38.800
I apply mathematics to the
study of life in the ocean.

18:39.199 --> 18:40.901
You're an oceanographer?

18:42.169 --> 18:44.505
There's no such
discipline as oceanography.

18:44.971 --> 18:46.705
I'm a bio-mathematician.

18:46.707 --> 18:50.344
It's the working of the science
to whatever is in the sea.

18:51.245 --> 18:52.781
Or at the bottom of it.

18:55.216 --> 18:56.651
Precisely.

18:58.753 --> 19:00.820
It's quite rude,
just sitting there, watching me.

19:00.822 --> 19:02.687
Insisting that
we eat something?

19:02.689 --> 19:04.525
I know, it's entirely
unreasonable.

19:07.661 --> 19:10.097
So, what ocean is your favorite?

19:10.430 --> 19:13.601
It has to be that one,
the Atlantic.

19:15.169 --> 19:16.571
Okay...

19:17.671 --> 19:18.640
Carry on.

19:18.906 --> 19:20.309
- About?
- The sea.

19:20.874 --> 19:23.377
I feel certain it's going
to tell me all about you.

19:28.216 --> 19:29.685
All right, then, um...

19:31.151 --> 19:33.051
close your eyes.

19:33.053 --> 19:35.721
You're determined not
to let me eat, aren't you?

19:35.723 --> 19:36.892
Close them.

19:41.161 --> 19:43.998
The ocean has five layers.

19:44.332 --> 19:47.332
- Five.
- Are you going to cooperate?

19:47.334 --> 19:48.367
Mm-hm.

19:48.369 --> 19:51.039
- I want you to picture this.
- Okay.

19:53.874 --> 19:59.747
Yes, it has five layers
and the first one is epipelagic.

20:00.948 --> 20:05.986
It contains all the plant
life and coral reefs.

20:07.688 --> 20:10.121
Whatever memory
you have of baptism,

20:10.123 --> 20:16.097
or any other form of submersion,
is there in the blue water.

20:17.331 --> 20:19.101
The next layer,

20:19.734 --> 20:21.803
is mesopelagic.

20:24.438 --> 20:26.608
This is the twilight zone...

20:27.742 --> 20:28.976
into which...

20:29.509 --> 20:33.814
blue and all other
colors and light vanish.

20:41.022 --> 20:44.159
Everything under the
mesopelagic is night.

20:44.592 --> 20:48.028
If you were with me
in a submersible,

20:49.429 --> 20:53.965
that's like
a deep-sea submarine...

20:53.967 --> 20:55.437
Is it yellow?

20:56.871 --> 20:58.707
- Of course it is.
- Excellent.

20:58.906 --> 21:00.705
If you were with me
in one of those,

21:00.707 --> 21:02.944
you would have spent
two hours at least,

21:03.578 --> 21:07.849
in the blackness you're
in now, to get down to...

21:12.186 --> 21:13.855
You can open your eyes.

21:14.956 --> 21:16.625
The hadopelagic,

21:17.358 --> 21:19.628
which is what interests me.

21:22.630 --> 21:27.065
Hadal from the Greek "Hades",
meaning unseen.

21:27.067 --> 21:28.569
Doesn't it mean hell?

21:31.005 --> 21:32.207
To some.

21:33.274 --> 21:37.379
This is the other world
in our world.

21:37.844 --> 21:39.978
It's just miles and
miles of blackness?

21:39.980 --> 21:41.982
No one knows much
about the mantle.

21:42.350 --> 21:43.749
They think it has no life,

21:43.751 --> 21:46.584
and therefore no
possibility of reanimation,

21:46.586 --> 21:48.956
and is so without
scientific interest.

21:49.990 --> 21:51.492
I disagree.

21:52.459 --> 21:53.826
It needs to be explored.

21:53.828 --> 21:57.232
What? Excuse me,
what exactly is it that you do?

21:57.430 --> 22:01.533
I... I study...
I collect samples,

22:01.535 --> 22:03.535
from what I think is...

22:03.537 --> 22:06.173
the living bit
of the mantle.

22:06.740 --> 22:10.878
The first few kilometers
underlying the Hadal deep.

22:11.445 --> 22:14.381
I believe that all life and...

22:14.649 --> 22:17.151
regeneration in our world
belongs to it.

22:17.985 --> 22:21.490
We refuse to value what's
down there because it's dark.

22:21.889 --> 22:25.092
We want to forget there
is darkness in our world, and...

22:26.593 --> 22:28.796
and to be on a beach
is to be lucky.

22:29.162 --> 22:31.665
We don't educate ourselves.

22:32.832 --> 22:34.433
Our world is
firstly about power,

22:34.435 --> 22:36.104
it's only secondly
about education.

22:50.317 --> 22:52.751
What?

22:52.753 --> 22:55.053
No, don't worry about me,
just you carry on.

22:55.055 --> 22:57.723
No, I'm just writing down
what you just said

22:57.725 --> 23:00.462
- about power and education.
- Mm-hmm.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.663
- Oh, wow, okay.
- I like it.

23:03.598 --> 23:07.569
I'm actually going down on one of those
submersibles in a couple of weeks.

23:07.767 --> 23:10.871
I've waited years
for this opportunity.

23:11.138 --> 23:13.842
Come on, congratulations.

23:15.575 --> 23:16.911
Thank you.

23:26.586 --> 23:28.355
What do you do?

23:28.855 --> 23:33.725
I consult on water
projects in Africa, actually.

23:33.727 --> 23:35.994
Hey, we've got water in common.

23:35.996 --> 23:39.601
- You work for charity?
- The British government.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.702
You live in Africa?

23:42.335 --> 23:43.637
Nairobi.

23:44.338 --> 23:45.571
Do you like it?

23:45.573 --> 23:47.309
I do, most of the time.

23:48.842 --> 23:50.943
Nairobi gets a bit
treacherous sometimes.

23:50.945 --> 23:52.781
People say it's like
an African river,

23:53.246 --> 23:54.480
you can't see into it,

23:54.482 --> 23:55.917
you don't know where
the crocodiles are,

23:56.117 --> 23:58.117
and you can't see the
rapids coming at you.

23:58.119 --> 24:01.590
But, I tell you,
it's got its own...

24:01.988 --> 24:03.091
luster.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.594
I kinda miss it,
when I'm away too long.

24:07.061 --> 24:07.996
Wonderful place.

24:09.729 --> 24:11.298
I have a pool.

24:15.035 --> 24:16.601
<i>So, you're saying that...</i>

24:16.603 --> 24:18.436
descending to
the bottom of the ocean,

24:18.438 --> 24:22.177
makes us challenge our sense
of self and where we came from?

24:22.642 --> 24:25.343
And that we are not
interested in your work,

24:25.345 --> 24:29.083
because we don't want to have
come from the scum in the ocean?

24:31.552 --> 24:33.321
It kind of makes sense to me.

24:35.156 --> 24:36.858
- Does it?
- Yeah.

24:37.591 --> 24:39.628
It's caused people
to fight over...

24:43.330 --> 24:45.400
When I drop everything...

24:46.233 --> 24:49.638
I wanna make a case for my
theory on life down there.

24:50.236 --> 24:53.807
And having been down there
it gets more complicated.

24:55.042 --> 24:59.246
What counts the most is
being published in <i>Nature.</i>

24:59.813 --> 25:01.515
So, you're going
to go down there

25:01.815 --> 25:03.884
and you're going to be
surrounded by water,

25:04.185 --> 25:08.323
and infinite blackness
in what, a month?

25:10.056 --> 25:10.857
Yeah.

25:11.124 --> 25:12.960
Are you afraid
something might happen?

25:14.894 --> 25:17.231
I try not to think about that.

25:19.365 --> 25:20.734
Why?

25:21.802 --> 25:23.138
What would happen?

25:24.438 --> 25:26.107
If the submersible
would crack?

25:26.306 --> 25:27.374
Mm-hmm.

25:28.842 --> 25:32.211
Water would come in and
my lungs would seal off,

25:32.213 --> 25:35.813
and I would die a dry drowning
by acidosis and hypoxia.

25:35.815 --> 25:37.384
What would that feel like?

25:47.428 --> 25:50.462
Well, if anything
were to happen,

25:50.464 --> 25:55.937
it would probably just be us
getting stuck down there,

25:56.669 --> 25:58.406
unable to move.

26:00.707 --> 26:04.709
And there's only five days
of oxygen in the sub,

26:04.711 --> 26:06.578
and no one can reach
you down there.

26:06.580 --> 26:07.682
Why?

26:07.684 --> 26:12.053
There's only one of those
deep sea submersibles in Europe.

26:15.755 --> 26:19.627
So, I wouldn't drown,
I'd suffocate.

26:20.393 --> 26:23.397
I'd have a lot of time
to think about things.

26:34.041 --> 26:36.144
What's that
tattoo on your arm?

26:36.442 --> 26:37.778
A mistake.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.083
- You were a paratrooper?
- Yeah, I was.

26:42.315 --> 26:45.919
I was very young, though. It was
just a short service commission.

26:47.121 --> 26:49.290
This is what
I wanted to show you.

26:55.028 --> 26:57.064
Now this is what
I came here for.

27:06.673 --> 27:08.709
There was 5,000
Canadian soldiers,

27:09.509 --> 27:12.446
and a thousand British soldiers
tried to take this beach.

27:14.380 --> 27:17.418
The guns inside that bunker
killed every one of them.

27:17.751 --> 27:19.287
It was an incredible sacrifice.

28:12.605 --> 28:14.342
Hey, hey, hey!

28:28.755 --> 28:30.057
Ah!

28:37.765 --> 28:38.867
Here.

28:39.934 --> 28:41.369
That was cold!

28:44.737 --> 28:46.874
What's got into you,
Mr. More?

28:47.173 --> 28:50.242
You've been talking to me now
for a long time about the world,

28:50.244 --> 28:53.177
and whales and the ocean,

28:53.179 --> 28:57.718
and, Dani, you have barely
used the words I or me.

28:58.686 --> 29:01.522
You've learned to listen
awfully well, haven't you?

29:04.858 --> 29:07.262
Why did you have to
acquire that skill?

29:09.129 --> 29:12.433
Why would you say that
I had to acquire it?

29:13.100 --> 29:15.367
'Cause no one is an
expert at anything,

29:15.369 --> 29:19.307
if there is not a burning need somewhere
to have that particular skill.

29:21.641 --> 29:22.976
I have sisters.

29:23.276 --> 29:25.313
Would you like
another drink?

29:26.447 --> 29:28.149
- No.
- Okay.

29:33.253 --> 29:38.126
So, what's your favorite
water body, since you asked me?

29:38.691 --> 29:40.193
The human body.

29:40.460 --> 29:43.294
It's my favorite body,
It's mainly water.

29:43.296 --> 29:46.133
- So much cleverer than me.
- I doubt that.

29:46.699 --> 29:47.701
Africa?

29:48.067 --> 29:49.900
Not really, I...

29:57.977 --> 29:59.546
You're still wet.

30:01.482 --> 30:03.151
And you're not...

30:04.384 --> 30:05.719
wet.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.057
You're chicken.

30:14.828 --> 30:16.364
Chicken.

30:46.025 --> 30:48.028
Are you cold?

30:48.795 --> 30:50.465
Yeah.

33:51.078 --> 33:54.982
<i>The mobile
subscriber cannot be reached.</i>

34:08.928 --> 34:10.630
- Ready?
- All right.

34:17.371 --> 34:19.806
<i>Today is the...
the 20th of May.</i>

34:20.273 --> 34:23.908
It's the 21st of May, and...

34:26.911 --> 34:28.112
Will you go and get the fuck...

34:28.114 --> 34:31.114
I will not be quiet!

34:32.485 --> 34:33.753
No! No!

34:38.190 --> 34:39.360
Are you spy?

34:48.601 --> 34:49.904
Fuck.

35:00.747 --> 35:02.550
I am myself still...

35:07.086 --> 35:09.422
I'm still James More.

35:10.289 --> 35:12.025
There's no moon.

35:13.193 --> 35:14.794
There's...

35:16.630 --> 35:18.265
only blackness,

35:19.700 --> 35:20.768
like...

35:22.369 --> 35:24.639
like the one that you know,

35:26.173 --> 35:27.707
my Dani.

36:18.157 --> 36:20.225
<i>This is what
we found for you, J.</i>

36:20.227 --> 36:21.526
<i>Yusef Mohamud al-Afghani</i>

36:21.528 --> 36:23.160
<i>is now indeed
a forward commander</i>

36:23.162 --> 36:24.164
<i>of al-Qaeda in Somalia.</i>

36:24.497 --> 36:26.231
<i>He seems to be running
the show there.</i>

36:26.233 --> 36:27.968
<i>If ever you see him,
you're close.</i>

36:28.367 --> 36:31.604
<i>There's another guy,
James, Saif Al-Husni.</i>

36:32.072 --> 36:33.537
<i>Was a suicide bomber.</i>

36:33.539 --> 36:35.707
<i>Pulled the ring, but the
vest didn't detonate.</i>

36:35.709 --> 36:39.744
<i>PTSD big time,
extremely violent, apparently.</i>

36:39.746 --> 36:41.245
<i>He probably thinks
he'll never die.</i>

36:41.247 --> 36:42.749
<i>He probably wants to die.</i>

36:43.015 --> 36:45.985
<i>Good luck, J,
if you're really going.</i>

36:48.722 --> 36:52.657
Out there in the deep,
there's salp and jellyfish,

36:52.659 --> 36:56.530
whose vertical migrations
are equivalent in scale to...

36:58.197 --> 37:02.367
to us, as if these birds were
just to fly up from the trees,

37:02.369 --> 37:04.704
and go straight up into space.

37:06.740 --> 37:09.477
On a planetary scale,
the birds crawl.

37:11.378 --> 37:12.912
What?

37:13.646 --> 37:16.314
We go to sleep and you're
nervous to meet me over again,

37:16.316 --> 37:17.785
is that what's happening here?

37:21.086 --> 37:24.425
I usually don't see
the person the day after.

37:26.059 --> 37:27.495
I work.

37:31.164 --> 37:35.102
Don't you think I should at
least know something about you?

37:35.434 --> 37:37.637
Oh, I get it,
you want to pry.

37:39.104 --> 37:41.205
- I don't want to pry.
- What do you want to know?

37:41.207 --> 37:43.144
I want to know about you.

37:47.314 --> 37:49.650
About being a soldier,
for instance.

37:52.184 --> 37:54.654
You're going to ask me what
it's like to kill somebody?

37:54.954 --> 37:56.689
- No.
- Good.

38:01.093 --> 38:02.963
Tell me,
tell me anything.

38:03.829 --> 38:06.032
Anything that will
tell me about you.

38:11.037 --> 38:12.939
Then you're going
to go into the sea?

38:13.539 --> 38:17.675
It's getting awfully cold, and I
really think you should go in soon.

38:17.677 --> 38:20.113
What's the most essential
thing about being a soldier?

38:20.347 --> 38:21.649
Obedience.

38:23.316 --> 38:24.885
Okay.

38:26.887 --> 38:27.921
Death.

38:29.389 --> 38:31.391
It gets very real when you're watching
somebody die in front of you.

38:31.590 --> 38:33.193
You're thinking,
is this all I am?

38:33.392 --> 38:34.861
Is this all I added up to?

38:35.061 --> 38:37.898
And all the clichés are true.
You're thinking, why now?

38:38.298 --> 38:39.863
Why did it have to be...

38:39.865 --> 38:43.236
this happen before I realize
what life truly is?

38:44.604 --> 38:46.573
It's direct, it's immediate,

38:46.773 --> 38:49.642
and it's their whole
life exposed to you.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.580
Did you think about
your own death a lot?

38:54.881 --> 38:56.450
I did, and I do.

38:57.082 --> 39:00.517
I've heard people telling me that
they've had those exact same thoughts

39:00.519 --> 39:01.653
when they fell in love.

39:01.655 --> 39:03.791
No, you don't die
when you fall in love.

39:06.526 --> 39:08.262
Have you fallen in love?

39:14.767 --> 39:16.704
I think you should go in
for your swim now.

39:16.936 --> 39:18.505
Time's up, eh?

39:23.642 --> 39:25.175
No, no don't!

39:25.177 --> 39:28.546
No, no, not in my clothes,
not in my clothes!

39:31.383 --> 39:33.017
- It's cold.
- No, don't throw me in!

39:33.019 --> 39:35.089
No!

39:46.532 --> 39:50.537
You are not going
to win me over.

39:50.970 --> 39:52.206
Yes, I am.

39:54.407 --> 39:57.244
That's exactly what
I'm going to do.

40:01.213 --> 40:03.182
Congratulations.

40:04.351 --> 40:05.753
Where did you guys grow up?

40:06.653 --> 40:09.122
Sydney, London, Stockholm,

40:09.488 --> 40:11.758
depending on
Daddy's work, really.

40:12.124 --> 40:15.295
My parents were the ones
who used to take me here.

40:18.097 --> 40:22.135
Dani, do you even
know a poor person?

40:25.472 --> 40:28.008
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah?

40:31.477 --> 40:33.479
Oh.

40:33.713 --> 40:35.548
- You.
- Me?

40:35.749 --> 40:39.453
No, no, no, no, no,
I am not poor.

40:39.785 --> 40:42.856
I can afford to come to a
place like this once a year.

40:45.892 --> 40:47.557
Is it true that
there's oxygen stored

40:47.559 --> 40:49.160
in the micro life at
the bottom of the ocean,

40:49.162 --> 40:51.329
and that one day
it's going to run out?

40:51.331 --> 40:52.800
We shouldn't run out...

40:53.532 --> 40:56.336
if we take the right steps.

40:56.702 --> 41:01.104
I mean, we are entering an age where
everything will be quantified.

41:01.106 --> 41:03.707
What we see as abundant,
will be limited.

41:03.709 --> 41:08.445
So, oxygen will be like
water and minerals and fuels.

41:08.447 --> 41:09.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:09.615 --> 41:11.951
Like oxygen, like...

41:12.418 --> 41:14.218
like air-oxygen?

41:14.220 --> 41:15.255
Like oxygen?

41:16.822 --> 41:20.059
Yeah, if we keep going
the way we're going.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.591
Wow.

41:21.593 --> 41:24.130
That's why I need to
get to the bottom of it.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.536
Was that a science
person's joke?

41:30.736 --> 41:33.273
Not everyone can be
as witty as you.

41:33.472 --> 41:36.442
I know, but...

41:36.642 --> 41:38.678
it was rubbish.

41:38.945 --> 41:43.150
Oh, I think I'm slightly
less attracted to you now.

42:04.403 --> 42:06.139
Just look at you.

42:08.006 --> 42:09.742
You mongrel.

42:11.410 --> 42:12.979
Half Australian,

42:13.747 --> 42:15.115
some Swedish,

42:17.450 --> 42:19.319
a touch of English.

42:27.059 --> 42:31.064
Those lines,
are here to stay.

42:36.068 --> 42:38.171
I'm going to remember this.

42:52.952 --> 42:56.390
What if I come and
visit you in Nairobi?

43:00.626 --> 43:02.962
I want to swim in your pool.

43:21.814 --> 43:24.985
Don't, I have 58 minutes.

43:38.097 --> 43:39.432
Read that.

43:59.318 --> 44:00.521
Did you read it?

44:02.021 --> 44:04.158
Just feels like I'm...

44:04.691 --> 44:07.261
reading the same news
all over again.

44:08.927 --> 44:11.931
- It's not interesting enough?
- It's tough 'cause I...

44:12.532 --> 44:15.068
feel like there's nothing
we can do about it.

44:15.434 --> 44:17.434
We could read about it,
we could get interested.

44:17.436 --> 44:20.872
We could educate ourselves and
get involved in a solution.

44:20.874 --> 44:24.444
How is there a solution
to a problem that has roots

44:24.843 --> 44:28.445
in ancient conflicts,
where religious...

44:28.447 --> 44:31.050
What are you saying, you don't
think there's a solution?

44:31.818 --> 44:32.983
I don't know.

44:32.985 --> 44:34.785
This is the same
as your work, Dani.

44:34.787 --> 44:36.187
Trying to get people interested

44:36.189 --> 44:38.388
in potentially
life-saving information,

44:38.390 --> 44:39.990
that lies at the bottom
of the sea, in the dark,

44:39.992 --> 44:41.825
so nobody wants
to know about it.

44:41.827 --> 44:43.093
It's the exact same thing.

44:43.095 --> 44:44.528
Get them interested,
educate them,

44:44.530 --> 44:47.698
get them involved in a solution,
and that is amazing.

44:47.700 --> 44:51.104
But this is our world,
too, isn't it?

44:55.742 --> 44:57.410
I don't know if
that's our world.

44:57.644 --> 44:59.111
Oh.

45:01.546 --> 45:03.983
So, you can be stupid, as well.

45:07.854 --> 45:09.489
I'm sorry.

45:10.189 --> 45:11.592
I'm sorry.

45:38.184 --> 45:39.716
Do you
want your backpack in...

45:39.718 --> 45:41.218
In with me, please.

45:56.269 --> 45:57.537
Okay.

45:59.838 --> 46:01.440
I'm in.

46:07.981 --> 46:10.050
I'm in, too.

47:18.851 --> 47:20.387
Hey.

47:21.887 --> 47:25.189
I just wanted to say
that I miss you already.

47:25.191 --> 47:27.323
I'm going to turn
the car around.

47:27.325 --> 47:30.593
Arretez, can you please
pull over, <i>merci.</i>

47:32.664 --> 47:34.131
<i>No.</i>

47:34.133 --> 47:36.533
- I've stopped the car.
- <i>No. Don't.</i>

47:36.535 --> 47:37.801
I've stopped it, I can...

47:37.803 --> 47:40.704
No, I'm gonna go
for my swim now.

47:40.706 --> 47:41.742
Okay.

47:43.809 --> 47:45.277
<i>See you soon.</i>

48:26.452 --> 48:28.287
Nabad, Sharif?

48:28.588 --> 48:30.791
Come with me.

48:39.465 --> 48:40.700
Nabad.

48:41.400 --> 48:42.635
Nabad.

48:44.137 --> 48:45.604
Uh, Sharif?

48:48.941 --> 48:50.510
I came here to meet Sharif.

48:53.146 --> 48:54.711
Can you take me to him, please?

49:50.570 --> 49:52.738
Because of
charity and love,

49:53.271 --> 49:55.842
you should never allow death
to rule your thoughts.

49:58.311 --> 49:59.746
Because of charity and love,

50:00.246 --> 50:02.782
you should never allow death
to rule your thoughts.

50:04.115 --> 50:05.718
Because of charity and love,

50:05.952 --> 50:09.156
you should never allow death
to rule your thoughts.

50:10.389 --> 50:12.092
Because of charity and love,

50:12.592 --> 50:15.595
you should never allow death
to rule your thoughts.

50:17.630 --> 50:19.363
Well, I'm just
used to seeing her

50:19.365 --> 50:22.099
careen between work
and relief from work,

50:22.101 --> 50:23.533
not unlike the rest of us.

50:23.535 --> 50:25.104
Well, as long
as she can focus.

50:25.303 --> 50:27.870
Yes, I mean,
this expedition is...

50:27.872 --> 50:30.240
The one, definitely.

50:30.242 --> 50:32.508
We all feel you are close
to a breakthrough,

50:32.510 --> 50:34.245
that would forever
change the understanding

50:34.247 --> 50:36.349
of the dimensions
of the life on Earth.

50:36.548 --> 50:39.718
Absolutely, we've been
speaking about this.

50:40.318 --> 50:42.621
We're jealous.

50:42.854 --> 50:43.756
Good.

50:44.155 --> 50:46.492
Pressure is up.

50:47.293 --> 50:48.794
I know.

50:49.427 --> 50:51.597
<i>The mailbox is full.</i>

50:52.064 --> 50:54.231
<i>Please try to call later...</i>

51:03.376 --> 51:07.347
<i>Dani, what do you think the
biggest obstacle to a solution is?</i>

51:07.947 --> 51:12.349
<i>I think it's history,
how it left them behind.</i>

51:12.351 --> 51:13.320
<i>But "them,"</i>

51:14.486 --> 51:15.021
<i>that's just us
in a different form, isn't it?</i>

51:16.155 --> 51:18.225
So, what do you
think the biggest obstacle is?

51:18.590 --> 51:21.560
It's the most beautiful
thing about them,

51:24.463 --> 51:26.332
their ability to believe.

51:37.209 --> 51:38.945
You're no troubled man.

51:39.211 --> 51:40.811
Your mind is not troubled.

51:40.813 --> 51:43.249
Your mind
isn't troubled.

51:45.217 --> 51:46.686
You know...

51:51.990 --> 51:53.927
you know where you are from.

52:15.648 --> 52:18.617
There she is!

52:19.050 --> 52:20.753
Let me have a look.

52:32.064 --> 52:33.863
Up, fool!

52:35.300 --> 52:37.403
Let's go!

52:38.738 --> 52:41.073
Move!
Move! Move from here!

53:06.331 --> 53:10.133
<i>Megafaunal abundances
also showed significant variations,</i>

53:10.135 --> 53:13.236
<i>chi squared equals 273.42,</i>

53:13.238 --> 53:14.937
<i>df equals 5.</i>

53:19.445 --> 53:22.414
<i>with an overall increasing
trend over the course of...</i>

54:12.898 --> 54:16.403
I'm on the
ocean floor now, Dani.

56:11.282 --> 56:12.885
We will kill you now.

56:18.990 --> 56:20.090
Our Father,

56:20.092 --> 56:24.130
who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

56:26.398 --> 56:28.200
Thy Kingdom come,

56:30.135 --> 56:31.704
Thy will be done...

56:32.371 --> 56:34.006
Get ready!

57:15.581 --> 57:17.316
Oh, God, James.

57:20.352 --> 57:22.922
Oh, man, you shit yourself.

59:10.829 --> 59:12.896
<i>So, you're
going to go down there</i>

59:12.898 --> 59:14.898
<i>and you're going to be
surrounded by water,</i>

59:14.900 --> 59:17.302
<i>and infinite blackness.</i>

59:17.836 --> 59:19.738
Are you afraid
something might happen?

01:00:55.968 --> 01:00:59.172
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:01:06.979 --> 01:01:08.410
<i>There were
also significant differences</i>

01:01:08.412 --> 01:01:11.046
<i>in the numbers of
predators, scavengers...</i>

01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:26.264
Open your eyes.

01:01:27.298 --> 01:01:28.467
Open them!

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:32.605
You're alive.

01:01:33.771 --> 01:01:34.974
Good.

01:01:37.342 --> 01:01:38.311
Drink this.

01:01:55.559 --> 01:01:56.661
Why are you here?

01:01:56.994 --> 01:01:59.731
I've told your men,
I'm a water engineer.

01:02:00.331 --> 01:02:03.468
I wanted...
I still want to build...

01:02:04.035 --> 01:02:06.938
a water system in Kismayo,
I was invited.

01:02:07.872 --> 01:02:09.673
Not to do something else?

01:02:09.675 --> 01:02:12.345
No, I'm just...

01:02:21.019 --> 01:02:22.889
What's your
business with Sharif?

01:02:24.923 --> 01:02:27.490
He was the tribal leader
in Kismayo,

01:02:27.492 --> 01:02:30.492
and I was going to teach the
water recognition system to him.

01:02:30.494 --> 01:02:31.593
How do you know him?

01:02:31.595 --> 01:02:33.762
I didn't, he contacted me.

01:02:33.764 --> 01:02:36.434
He did? How?

01:02:37.068 --> 01:02:39.202
He got in touch with the
charity that I work for

01:02:39.204 --> 01:02:42.171
that installs wells
in refugee camps.

01:02:42.173 --> 01:02:45.977
They asked me to
meet him, so I did.

01:02:48.613 --> 01:02:51.481
Do you understand that
we are fighting a war here?

01:02:51.483 --> 01:02:52.385
I understand.

01:02:53.651 --> 01:02:54.850
Then what is this?

01:02:54.852 --> 01:02:56.553
It was a mistake,
I was a young man.

01:02:56.555 --> 01:02:59.959
- I needed a job!
- Coming here was a mistake!

01:03:00.325 --> 01:03:02.591
Do you have children,
a wife?

01:03:02.593 --> 01:03:03.662
I'm not married.

01:03:04.496 --> 01:03:06.999
Your people rely on me
for clean water.

01:03:07.331 --> 01:03:11.436
We shall call you Biyole.
That means water boy.

01:03:13.671 --> 01:03:15.340
My name is James.

01:03:23.948 --> 01:03:26.452
Do you drink alcohol, Biyole?

01:03:27.251 --> 01:03:28.019
Yeah.

01:03:28.919 --> 01:03:31.456
Alcohol separates you
from your creator.

01:03:32.858 --> 01:03:34.293
Yeah, no doubt.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.965
It is important to me
that you are being treated...

01:03:39.331 --> 01:03:41.599
generously. It is Allah's wish.

01:03:42.534 --> 01:03:43.568
Thank you.

01:05:14.593 --> 01:05:18.431
We also need a
urine sample from you.

01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:22.834
Doctor Shadid.

01:05:25.736 --> 01:05:27.338
Open, please.

01:05:28.039 --> 01:05:29.742
No hemorrhage.

01:05:34.778 --> 01:05:36.445
How does it look, doctor?

01:05:36.447 --> 01:05:37.847
Not too bad.

01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:39.184
For an infidel.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.021
Breathe, deeper.

01:05:48.927 --> 01:05:50.563
- You have a fracture.
- Oh.

01:05:50.762 --> 01:05:54.733
It's a primitive diagnosis,
but we have limited x-ray.

01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:02.104
This is more serious,
Mr. Water.

01:06:02.106 --> 01:06:03.575
My name is James More.

01:06:03.807 --> 01:06:04.876
More?

01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:09.347
I was told to
call you Mr. Water.

01:06:13.318 --> 01:06:15.184
Doctor, I haven't
spoken to my family.

01:06:15.186 --> 01:06:16.553
They don't know that I'm okay.

01:06:16.555 --> 01:06:18.357
Can you please
help me with that?

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:19.358
No.

01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:22.158
<i>...across the years.
In particular,</i>

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.861
<i>deposit feeders were at
their lowest density in 2007.</i>

01:06:24.863 --> 01:06:27.997
<i>2.50 plus or minus 0.11...</i>

01:06:34.372 --> 01:06:35.508
Don't.

01:06:39.211 --> 01:06:42.381
I've prepared a dozen samples
for you, minus one.

01:06:43.215 --> 01:06:44.749
I'll be all right,
I can handle it.

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:47.185
You sure?

01:06:47.818 --> 01:06:49.387
Wouldn't say it if I couldn't.

01:06:51.423 --> 01:06:52.689
I looked over the work.

01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:54.260
We'll be fine, as long
as you do your part.

01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:57.829
I'd be fine if I had
signal at some point.

01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:00.562
I mean, we've been out now
in the middle of the ocean,

01:07:00.564 --> 01:07:02.966
with no signal,
multiple dives,

01:07:02.968 --> 01:07:05.004
and it just...
frustrates me, okay?

01:07:05.202 --> 01:07:06.405
Okay.

01:07:08.706 --> 01:07:09.941
So, you can't reach him.

01:07:10.941 --> 01:07:14.611
Why don't you focus on your work
and put him out of your mind.

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:17.883
Cover of <i>Nature.</i>

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:22.387
Isn't that what we
promised each other?

01:07:23.153 --> 01:07:24.722
Why don't you look at me,
Dani?

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.398
I know all about self-sabotage.

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:35.233
I'm the expert on it.

01:07:38.102 --> 01:07:42.204
I want you to tell me now that
this is not you doubting yourself.

01:07:42.206 --> 01:07:44.342
- This is not what this is.
- It's not doubt.

01:07:44.608 --> 01:07:48.213
'Cause it deserves the cover,
not just to be published.

01:07:49.581 --> 01:07:52.814
Searching for life that may
share the same way of life,

01:07:52.816 --> 01:07:55.153
that we may eventually
find in water on Mars?

01:07:55.552 --> 01:07:57.854
Possibly proving that
a billion years ago,

01:07:57.856 --> 01:08:00.426
the same ecosystems
existed here and there?

01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:03.795
You've touched
the limits of life.

01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:06.232
You've touched it.

01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:08.398
And now we have to wrap
our whole hands around it,

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.369
and bring it to the world...

01:08:11.635 --> 01:08:12.904
and finish this.

01:08:13.771 --> 01:08:15.872
Ifremer, they've partnered
with us, there's a lot at stake,

01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:17.738
- a lot of money has been spent.
- I know, I know.

01:08:17.741 --> 01:08:19.743
Now is not the time to
doubt yourself, Dani.

01:08:20.111 --> 01:08:21.380
I know.

01:08:24.581 --> 01:08:25.617
Good.

01:08:29.353 --> 01:08:30.388
Morning, Ms. Flinders.

01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:32.290
- Captain.
- Mr. Darren.

01:08:32.523 --> 01:08:34.660
Thank you for
coming down, um...

01:08:36.227 --> 01:08:37.859
Do you think it would
be possible for me

01:08:37.862 --> 01:08:39.928
to go ashore after
the next two dives?

01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:44.600
I'm having some difficulties
finalizing my calculations.

01:08:44.602 --> 01:08:46.703
You mean go ashore
and stay ashore?

01:08:46.705 --> 01:08:48.470
The other teams
don't need you to log?

01:08:48.473 --> 01:08:50.707
- I can handle that work.
- And where would you...

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:53.443
We would be in reach
of the Faroe Islands,

01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:55.845
after Mark and Annie,
I think.

01:08:55.846 --> 01:08:57.078
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:08:57.081 --> 01:08:59.684
I could fly to Iceland from
there and then on to Jan Mayen.

01:09:00.018 --> 01:09:03.185
I don't see why not,
if your program sanctions it.

01:09:03.187 --> 01:09:05.488
- It does.
- All right, then.

01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:07.992
We'll arrange a boat
to come and pick you up.

01:09:10.127 --> 01:09:11.462
Thank you.

01:09:20.871 --> 01:09:22.941
- Good?
- Mm.

01:09:29.413 --> 01:09:32.515
There should be a ban on
injecting the suicide bombers

01:09:32.517 --> 01:09:34.883
with drugs to limit
their ability to think.

01:09:34.885 --> 01:09:35.920
They do that?

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.991
I saw it, in Mogadishu.

01:09:40.023 --> 01:09:41.559
I was really ashamed.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.095
They also do it in Pakistan.

01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:47.633
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you talking to me?

01:09:48.031 --> 01:09:50.134
You will be gone soon,
one way or the other.

01:09:50.567 --> 01:09:52.537
What do you mean by that?

01:09:56.073 --> 01:09:57.776
They will not kill you.

01:09:58.076 --> 01:10:00.309
Emir Yusef has promised.

01:10:00.311 --> 01:10:01.380
Oh, that's good to know.

01:10:01.646 --> 01:10:03.812
And there is
no one else here

01:10:03.814 --> 01:10:05.651
to talk to
with an education.

01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:23.869
So, what should we
do about the wells in Kismayo?

01:10:24.402 --> 01:10:26.872
Well, that's what
I came here to find out.

01:10:27.205 --> 01:10:29.942
The water is
too expensive for the poor.

01:10:31.009 --> 01:10:34.012
Do the local authorities have
control over all the water sources?

01:10:34.478 --> 01:10:37.014
- I do not know.
- You need to find out.

01:10:37.648 --> 01:10:39.916
You need to drive out
the water profiteers

01:10:39.918 --> 01:10:42.017
by any means necessary.

01:10:42.019 --> 01:10:43.054
Wait.

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:49.994
Well, you need to
ascertain the depth of each well,

01:10:50.394 --> 01:10:52.196
and the quality of
the water in it.

01:10:52.664 --> 01:10:56.532
So, for example, the closer
a well is to the sea,

01:10:56.534 --> 01:10:59.838
the more likely that
water is to be brackish.

01:11:00.472 --> 01:11:04.610
<i>You have to find out how many people
are using it, plot this all on a map.</i>

01:11:05.442 --> 01:11:07.275
I can help you with this.

01:11:07.277 --> 01:11:08.910
This is what I do,
this is my job.

01:11:08.912 --> 01:11:10.014
Already you are.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.418
Here, only the air is free.

01:11:13.017 --> 01:11:15.584
Not a day goes by
without a child in my care

01:11:15.586 --> 01:11:17.822
dying of some
curable illness.

01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:20.957
The people have no work.
They have not enough food.

01:11:20.959 --> 01:11:23.729
They have no school and this is
something we intend to correct.

01:11:24.094 --> 01:11:27.598
When it rains, the mud mixes with
the waste from the latrines.

01:11:27.999 --> 01:11:31.066
I do believe with so many people
packed in such conditions,

01:11:31.068 --> 01:11:34.270
Somalia will generate a plague
that will spread around the world.

01:11:34.272 --> 01:11:35.441
Cholera?

01:11:35.839 --> 01:11:37.041
A new plague.

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:41.479
You going to
turn it into a weapon?

01:11:55.159 --> 01:11:56.161
I am a doctor.

01:11:56.361 --> 01:11:58.197
Who keeps company
with killers.

01:11:59.664 --> 01:12:02.099
We have cholera here already.

01:12:03.268 --> 01:12:05.838
- Report it.
- Here?

01:12:06.237 --> 01:12:08.540
- To the United Nations.
- Never.

01:12:09.907 --> 01:12:12.477
- Even UNICEF?
- Especially UNICEF.

01:12:12.876 --> 01:12:14.843
Such an organization
that promises so much

01:12:14.845 --> 01:12:16.945
yet delivers so little
to the children?

01:12:16.947 --> 01:12:19.481
What is necessary is
to turn the Crusaders

01:12:19.483 --> 01:12:21.719
back from the Muslim
lands of Somalia,

01:12:22.085 --> 01:12:25.421
so that the people here can
live in a pure Islamic state.

01:12:25.423 --> 01:12:26.888
What's more important to you,

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:28.858
treating the women and children
that come to your clinic

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.964
and looking for your help,
or... Or... Or following jihad?

01:12:32.196 --> 01:12:34.066
I see both as one treatment.

01:12:34.432 --> 01:12:36.635
Medicine is mercy,

01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:39.304
jihad is duty.

01:12:39.603 --> 01:12:42.039
What about me,
am I a Crusader?

01:12:42.307 --> 01:12:44.276
I came here
to bring clean water.

01:12:44.576 --> 01:12:46.678
Allah will ask payment of you.

01:12:49.647 --> 01:12:51.850
You said I was
going to be spared.

01:12:54.318 --> 01:12:55.954
I need to go home.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.823
I need to go back to her.

01:13:05.796 --> 01:13:08.567
Who am I to know
the will of God?

01:13:09.334 --> 01:13:11.836
You may die tomorrow.

01:13:13.771 --> 01:13:17.543
Or... you may become
a blessed one.

01:14:02.219 --> 01:14:03.886
So, how long are
you going to stay with us

01:14:03.888 --> 01:14:05.890
on the Faroes,
Professor Flinders?

01:14:06.323 --> 01:14:07.625
At least a week,

01:14:07.991 --> 01:14:08.960
maybe more.

01:14:09.893 --> 01:14:11.593
We found a quiet
place for you,

01:14:11.595 --> 01:14:13.264
where you can
get your work done.

01:14:13.964 --> 01:14:14.932
Thank you.

01:14:15.265 --> 01:14:16.701
Captain's orders.

01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:20.171
Is it possible to dock
by any of those rocks?

01:14:20.537 --> 01:14:22.441
- Just for a few minutes?
- Sure.

01:14:34.485 --> 01:14:36.021
What are you doing?

01:14:36.987 --> 01:14:38.055
I'm counting.

01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:40.025
Lichens.

01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:42.694
Some of the species
here are very rare.

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.828
You think they're shells,
but if you come closer,

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:49.568
they're like tiny trees,
little forests.

01:14:49.767 --> 01:14:52.970
And this one here is
the marriage between a...

01:14:53.336 --> 01:14:55.640
a fungus and a cyan-bacteria.

01:14:56.374 --> 01:14:59.544
If you would magnify the edges,
you wouldn't be able to see,

01:14:59.777 --> 01:15:01.580
where life begins
and where it ends.

01:15:01.778 --> 01:15:03.648
It just dissolves from...

01:15:04.415 --> 01:15:07.319
from life into non-life.

01:18:02.425 --> 01:18:06.130
<i>"No man is an island,
entire of itself.</i>

01:18:06.429 --> 01:18:09.066
<i>Every man is a piece
of the continent,</i>

01:18:09.866 --> 01:18:11.402
<i>a part of the main.</i>

01:18:12.937 --> 01:18:16.308
Any man's death diminishes me,

01:18:16.874 --> 01:18:19.510
because I am
involved in mankind,

01:18:19.809 --> 01:18:24.982
<i>and therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls,</i>

01:18:25.515 --> 01:18:27.052
it tolls for thee."

01:18:27.518 --> 01:18:30.255
Do you keep John Donne
with you wherever you go?

01:18:30.888 --> 01:18:32.624
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:18:52.576 --> 01:18:54.079
Let me go.

01:18:55.312 --> 01:18:56.647
Let me go, please.

01:19:13.196 --> 01:19:17.167
I will be killed soon,
I welcome it.

01:19:19.804 --> 01:19:23.275
I believe you will
die too, Mr. Water.

01:20:26.771 --> 01:20:29.974
Biyole, we will
videotape you soon.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.610
Do you know <i>Bambi,</i> water boy?

01:20:33.677 --> 01:20:35.213
I saw it when I was young.

01:20:35.845 --> 01:20:38.316
You see, Bambi is
the innocent one.

01:20:38.549 --> 01:20:41.050
When you watch the
forest fire again,

01:20:41.052 --> 01:20:43.552
then you will see his
father protecting him,

01:20:43.554 --> 01:20:45.156
giving up his own life.

01:20:46.557 --> 01:20:49.561
It is like the Crusaders who
are burning the Islamic state.

01:22:27.892 --> 01:22:30.528
Abdul... go.

01:22:37.168 --> 01:22:39.771
I want to convert
you to Islam.

01:22:41.237 --> 01:22:44.342
And I want you to be
merciful and let me go.

01:22:50.481 --> 01:22:52.916
I won't make
a video for you.

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:55.117
I won't sit in
front of a camera

01:22:55.119 --> 01:22:56.717
and say the things
that you want me to say...

01:22:56.719 --> 01:22:58.021
You're of use to us.

01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:03.193
Shadid told me you can
clean water, stop diseases.

01:23:05.295 --> 01:23:07.097
You will do important
work for us.

01:23:07.531 --> 01:23:10.101
But you are a non-believer.

01:23:10.668 --> 01:23:13.237
I want you to meet
with your Creator.

01:23:13.603 --> 01:23:15.339
- No.
- No?

01:23:19.843 --> 01:23:21.278
No.

01:23:22.146 --> 01:23:24.948
Allah sees you,

01:23:25.415 --> 01:23:27.615
and he's waiting for you
to take the straight path.

01:23:27.617 --> 01:23:30.988
We've got Allah
in common, you and I.

01:23:31.187 --> 01:23:34.791
The Allah of our
common father, Abraham.

01:23:35.826 --> 01:23:37.695
I love Abraham.

01:23:38.128 --> 01:23:41.064
And I love his love
for all his children.

01:23:41.598 --> 01:23:46.637
And yes, I do believe
that Allah sees me.

01:23:47.237 --> 01:23:49.240
Sees us, but...

01:23:50.808 --> 01:23:51.809
no.

01:23:53.009 --> 01:23:55.245
Who are you to know this,

01:23:56.347 --> 01:23:58.383
and reject the Koran?

01:24:39.188 --> 01:24:40.924
Hey, stop!

01:25:04.113 --> 01:25:05.383
No!

01:25:05.715 --> 01:25:06.817
Fuck!

01:25:30.406 --> 01:25:31.842
Let's go.

01:26:45.915 --> 01:26:50.354
<i>Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.</i>

01:27:01.231 --> 01:27:04.900
<i>Recent geology
research from the University of Cincinnati,</i>

01:27:04.902 --> 01:27:07.569
<i>presents new evidence
for bacteria</i>

01:27:07.571 --> 01:27:10.504
<i>found fossilized in
two separate locations.</i>

01:27:10.506 --> 01:27:14.543
<i>The 2.52-billion-year-old
sulfur-oxidizing bacteria,</i>

01:27:14.545 --> 01:27:18.346
<i>are described as exceptionally
large, spherical-shaped,</i>

01:27:18.348 --> 01:27:20.782
<i>smooth-walled
microscopic structures,</i>

01:27:20.784 --> 01:27:22.383
<i>much larger than most modern...</i>

01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:20.978
You like working
for the MI6, Water?

01:28:23.112 --> 01:28:24.147
You have fun?

01:28:24.647 --> 01:28:28.149
I mean not now, but in
general, you have fun?

01:28:28.552 --> 01:28:30.017
You like the CIA?

01:28:30.019 --> 01:28:31.755
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:28:31.955 --> 01:28:32.990
Jihad is life.

01:28:33.823 --> 01:28:35.992
Your friends,
they don't care about you.

01:28:42.331 --> 01:28:44.168
Jihad is life after death.

01:28:56.479 --> 01:29:00.748
So, you're not sorry for
being a Donne-loving Brit

01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:02.484
who loves his God and country?

01:29:02.486 --> 01:29:05.055
No. No, I'm not.

01:29:05.522 --> 01:29:07.258
God save the Queen,
and all that.

01:29:07.991 --> 01:29:10.261
<i>I'm not sorry
for that, either.</i>

01:30:22.633 --> 01:30:25.303
She'll be ready to go
down tomorrow, professor.

01:30:25.802 --> 01:30:27.804
Wonderful, thank you.

01:33:19.576 --> 01:33:22.046
Come on!

01:33:32.488 --> 01:33:33.790
Let's go.

01:34:20.336 --> 01:34:21.871
Be safe, Dani.

01:34:56.673 --> 01:34:59.175
I don't want death, Dani.

01:34:59.442 --> 01:35:01.078
Not in this place.

01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:04.982
And not for any cause.

01:35:05.915 --> 01:35:07.217
I wanna...

01:35:11.388 --> 01:35:13.023
I want to be beside you.

01:35:33.977 --> 01:35:35.776
<i>We're listening, Nautile.</i>

01:35:35.778 --> 01:35:38.645
Nautile to Atalante, Nautile to Atalante.
Do you read me?

01:35:38.647 --> 01:35:41.184
Immersion one, zero, zero, zero.

01:35:41.418 --> 01:35:44.552
<i>Understood, Nautile,
1,000 meters deep. Over.</i>

01:35:44.554 --> 01:35:48.021
What have you been writing,
if you don't mind me asking?

01:35:48.023 --> 01:35:49.556
Oh, it's nothing.

01:35:49.558 --> 01:35:50.658
It's just something...

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.026
I felt like I needed to write.

01:35:53.028 --> 01:35:54.665
Can you read it to me?

01:35:59.436 --> 01:36:01.138
"You will be in Hades...

01:36:02.906 --> 01:36:04.975
drowned in oblivion,

01:36:05.642 --> 01:36:07.344
swallowing water,

01:36:08.978 --> 01:36:11.080
erasing all memory.

01:36:12.915 --> 01:36:16.619
You will take your place
among the teeming hordes,

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.689
of nameless micro-organisms."

01:36:20.255 --> 01:36:23.259
Must be bad luck, talking
like this at this depth.

01:37:00.196 --> 01:37:03.300
Thank you, Abdul,
thank you.

01:37:15.111 --> 01:37:17.147
In 20 minutes,
we'll be landing.

01:37:18.313 --> 01:37:20.985
So, I'm just switching
on the main propeller.

01:37:21.718 --> 01:37:22.987
Yeah.

01:37:24.387 --> 01:37:25.485
And the sonar.

01:37:25.487 --> 01:37:27.890
There's a reason
hell is down here.

01:37:28.357 --> 01:37:31.461
There's a reason heaven is up
there, I remember that now.

01:37:43.339 --> 01:37:45.342
Can we turn up
the lights now?

01:37:45.775 --> 01:37:47.210
Certainly.

01:37:54.017 --> 01:37:55.853
<i>Okay,
I dropped the second weight.</i>

01:37:56.452 --> 01:37:58.054
<i>We're listening, Nautile.</i>

01:37:58.321 --> 01:38:02.326
We're about to arrive,
give us our new coordinates.

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:07.227
<i>Navigation reset,
71 degrees north, 45 minutes,</i>

01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:09.133
<i>two degrees west, 28 minutes.</i>

01:38:09.499 --> 01:38:13.066
<i>You're almost at 3,400
meters now. Over.</i>

01:38:13.068 --> 01:38:14.670
Thanks, guys, we got that.

01:38:15.604 --> 01:38:17.607
We're close now.

01:38:22.144 --> 01:38:24.147
- Careful now.
- Yeah.

01:38:26.014 --> 01:38:28.449
Unbelievable.

01:38:28.451 --> 01:38:29.653
Amazing.

01:38:38.094 --> 01:38:40.761
There's a hydrothermal vent
straight ahead,

01:38:40.763 --> 01:38:41.665
just to the right.

01:38:42.932 --> 01:38:44.635
Shall we, Étienne?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.803
Yeah, sure.

01:38:55.344 --> 01:38:57.347
I'm opening the basket.

01:39:01.416 --> 01:39:06.322
And I'll start operating
the arm and collect.

01:39:10.125 --> 01:39:13.560
You can help me, Dani,
direct the camera to it.

01:39:13.562 --> 01:39:15.398
Oh, right, sorry.

01:39:16.299 --> 01:39:20.204
Can you get the arm to grab
a piece of that chimney?

01:39:20.769 --> 01:39:22.505
Yeah, sure.

01:39:25.008 --> 01:39:27.778
Okay, here comes Godzilla.

01:39:32.781 --> 01:39:34.117
Okay.

01:39:35.684 --> 01:39:38.187
We got it.

01:39:46.995 --> 01:39:49.599
Here it is,
mission accomplished.

01:39:51.968 --> 01:39:53.370
Fabulous.

01:39:54.836 --> 01:39:57.707
I so wish I could have
shared this with him.

01:39:58.073 --> 01:40:00.143
What would you
have told him now?

01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:03.147
I would have told him that...

01:40:03.946 --> 01:40:06.449
down here,
it's not photosynthetic,

01:40:06.648 --> 01:40:09.952
like everything on the surface,
but chemosynthetic.

01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:14.154
I would have told him
that life down here

01:40:14.156 --> 01:40:17.760
exists without light,
and that it grows,

01:40:19.228 --> 01:40:22.762
because of the
chemical energy just

01:40:22.764 --> 01:40:26.667
pouring out of those cracks,
from the core of our Earth.

01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:28.872
And he would have
understood that?

01:40:29.805 --> 01:40:31.174
Yes.

01:40:33.076 --> 01:40:35.042
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

01:40:35.044 --> 01:40:36.546
Are we all right?

01:40:42.986 --> 01:40:44.318
Okay, we need to reboot.

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.456
- You want some light?
- Yeah, please.

01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:49.927
Switch off all the instruments.

01:40:50.994 --> 01:40:51.929
Okay.

01:40:52.161 --> 01:40:55.265
I turn on the emergency
battery, switch on.

01:40:59.168 --> 01:41:00.603
Are there any other solutions?

01:41:01.237 --> 01:41:03.738
Do we need to drop the remaining
weight and go to the surface?

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:05.576
No, no, no,
we're still drifting.

01:41:05.907 --> 01:41:07.173
We can't see anything.

01:41:07.175 --> 01:41:10.112
We could float up, hit a chimney
that could fall on us, trap us.

01:41:10.446 --> 01:41:11.881
We can't move at all anymore.

01:41:12.714 --> 01:41:15.585
Right, let's go through
the sequence again.

01:41:22.592 --> 01:41:26.429
We will take our place
among the teeming hordes.

01:41:28.497 --> 01:41:31.101
We will be the foundation
for all forms.

01:41:31.634 --> 01:41:35.606
We will be in Hades,
drowned in oblivion,

01:41:37.072 --> 01:41:40.643
swallowing water,
erasing all memory.

01:41:41.978 --> 01:41:43.914
It will be a submergence.

01:41:51.353 --> 01:41:54.691
<i>I've thought about
bodies buried at sea.</i>

01:41:56.625 --> 01:41:59.495
<i>It's not dust to dust,
that's for sure.</i>

01:42:00.929 --> 01:42:02.499
It's water to water.

01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:10.840
We are all being made of water.

01:42:13.308 --> 01:42:15.044
<i>Like you said.</i>

01:42:31.094 --> 01:42:32.760
Because you're a wanderer

01:42:32.762 --> 01:42:34.798
who strayed from
the straight path,

01:42:35.397 --> 01:42:37.066
the only path to God...

01:42:38.334 --> 01:42:40.403
you're not going
to see Paradise.

01:42:53.849 --> 01:42:55.485
You know Arabic, Water.

01:42:57.553 --> 01:42:59.488
And you read the Koran.

01:43:01.557 --> 01:43:03.660
Okay, once more.

01:43:06.595 --> 01:43:07.964
On.

01:43:17.506 --> 01:43:20.074
Dani, we're on
emergency battery.

01:43:20.076 --> 01:43:21.478
We can't stay.

01:43:21.677 --> 01:43:23.410
Yes, we...

01:43:23.412 --> 01:43:25.014
we have all the samples.

01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:28.852
Let's take her up.

01:43:29.251 --> 01:43:31.120
Yeah, good.

01:44:14.196 --> 01:44:15.431
I'll see you again.

01:44:21.137 --> 01:44:22.037
<i>How much threat?</i>

01:44:23.304 --> 01:44:24.840
- <i>Multiple targets.</i>
- PILOT. <i>Copy that. Fire.</i>
