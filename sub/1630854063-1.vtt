WEBVTT

00:57.458 --> 00:58.759
- Calm down.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.161
- I'm not the one
who can't hold down a job.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.795
- I haven't asked you
for money in forever.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.231
- What the hell do you think
room and board is?

01:03.297 --> 01:07.201
- Okay,
let's take the temperature down

01:07.268 --> 01:08.569
just a little bit.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.474
- Tell her.
- Janet.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.577
- Tell her.
- Tell me what?

01:16.644 --> 01:18.312
- We sold the house.
- Janet.

01:19.613 --> 01:23.351
Your mother and I
are moving to Paris

01:23.417 --> 01:24.985
to kick off our retirement.

01:25.052 --> 01:29.190
It's a year
of croissants and brie.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.259
- But we don't know that
it'll only be for a year.

01:31.325 --> 01:34.195
- Yeah, we do not.
We do not know that.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.029
- So essentially,
you'll be on your own.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.198
- That's fine.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.899
I can be on my own.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.668
- Well,
we would love to see that.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.370
- We would.
- And look,

01:42.436 --> 01:45.005
we will always be there for you
if you need us.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.808
- But see, the point is,
Missy Moo, we won't.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.944
- That's not the point.

01:51.011 --> 01:56.950
- Just to clarify, you will
or will not be there for me?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.922
- Not.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.795
- Oh.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.587
Let's get this job.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.323
Okay.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.658
Here's the thing, Eliza.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.728
You are going to get this job.
Probably.

02:40.794 --> 02:44.665
You know?
'Cause you're very charming.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.367
Thank you.

02:46.434 --> 02:50.604
We're also going to lose the
job, because you're gonna

02:50.671 --> 02:52.740
want to say
what's in your head,

02:52.806 --> 02:57.811
and we have to watch
what we say and do.

03:01.249 --> 03:04.485
Oh, shit!

03:04.552 --> 03:06.354
Hi.
- Hello.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.589
Uh, Eliza, right?

03:08.656 --> 03:10.491
- Yes. Hey.
Nice to meet you.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.894
- We had said00, right?

03:13.961 --> 03:16.397
- We said16, actually.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.766
-16?

03:22.102 --> 03:25.673
So I'm Kyle,
and you are in very good hands,

03:25.739 --> 03:28.676
'cause I did extremely well
in personnel intake

03:28.742 --> 03:29.710
at business school.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.144
- "At business school."

03:31.279 --> 03:33.547
Way to fit that in
in the first ten seconds, Kyle.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.748
- Are you lost?

03:34.815 --> 03:36.950
Because you wandered
into my work.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.186
- I am definitely lost,
'cause I'm with you.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.789
- Okay, maybe I can draw you
a map...

03:41.855 --> 03:43.291
- Could you?
- Of our house.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.293
- Could you?
Could you highlight the exits

03:45.359 --> 03:46.894
so I can get out
of this house?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.297
- As you wish, Buttercup!

03:49.330 --> 03:51.765
- Kyle. Kyle.
We agreed we'd mute

03:51.832 --> 03:53.066
when talking to others.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.102
I swear, if one more person
forgets to mute,

03:55.168 --> 03:57.070
I am going to shoot myself
in the leg.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.507
- Why the leg?
- I got kids, man.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.643
Can't just go around shooting
myself in the face, can I?

04:02.710 --> 04:04.412
- The leg is more deadly
than the face.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.646
Femoral artery.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.780
Runs right down
the upper thighs.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.148
It's a great way to drop a man.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.318
He sees you going
for that area,

04:10.351 --> 04:13.887
his instinct will be
to protect the balls,

04:13.954 --> 04:16.023
leaving the thighs vulnerable.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.859
What he should do
is protect the thighs

04:18.926 --> 04:19.993
and give up the balls.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.696
- Question.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.798
This is my interview, right?

04:24.865 --> 04:28.101
- Yes, but business doesn't
stop for an interview.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.637
We gotta move
at the speed of money.

04:29.703 --> 04:33.006
- Oh, Mona thought
she heard her name.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.609
He said "money," not "Mona."

04:35.676 --> 04:37.177
Mona is our cat's name.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.346
- It's her middle name,
actually.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.847
We just call her Mona.
- Mm-hmm.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.081
- Except when she claws
at the curtains.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.249
- Yeah.
- Then it's...

04:42.350 --> 04:44.051
both:
Elizabeth Mona Morningsted.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.854
all: Think your actions
through, please.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.722
- But she's a good kitty.

04:48.789 --> 04:52.125
- We got her after we
found out that I'm infertile.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.361
I guess I have a lot of semen,

04:53.427 --> 04:55.729
but there's no actual sperms
in there.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.130
All milk, no cereal.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.866
- Do you have a lot
of work to do today?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.200
- Yeah, I got some stuff
I could be doing.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.536
- Okay, Eliza,
a lot of short-term jobs here.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.204
- Yes, thank you.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.507
- Oh. You went to
the same college as Neal.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.042
- What?

05:09.109 --> 05:11.144
That's very cool
to meet a fellow alumna.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.446
What are the odds?

05:12.513 --> 05:15.516
Those were good years
of my life.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.420
Yeah.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.722
We probably ran across
each other

05:21.789 --> 05:23.724
so many times,
and we didn't even know it.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.226
- That's wild.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.228
- You have to remember
Professor Clowning, right?

05:28.295 --> 05:30.230
- He was my favorite.
Super funny.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.899
- You'll be happy to know
that he finally decided

05:31.965 --> 05:33.200
to go through
with that surgery

05:33.266 --> 05:34.735
getting that growth
removed from his nose.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.537
Wasn't it crazy
how he just used to

05:36.604 --> 05:38.472
pile up the other professors
in his car with him,

05:38.539 --> 05:41.809
be, like,
20 of them in that car?

05:43.611 --> 05:46.614
- Okay, maybe you two can
reminisce some other time.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.416
Um...

05:48.416 --> 05:49.683
Oh, here's something.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.420
It looks like you stayed
at Mitchell and Edward

05:52.486 --> 05:54.622
for the better part
of the year.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.689
- Mm. Mm-hmm, yes.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.957
- What kind of company
was this?

05:57.024 --> 06:00.794
- It's two names.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.597
- Okay. Well, what kind
of business were they in?

06:03.664 --> 06:08.335
- You know,
I think Mitchell was a lawyer.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.103
- Were you a paralegal?

06:10.170 --> 06:12.339
- What? No. No.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.941
I couldn't. I don't.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.043
- You're kind of, like,
not answering his questions.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.445
Wouldn't you say
that's true, Boss?

06:17.478 --> 06:22.315
- Eliza, if I were to ask
Mitchell or Edward

06:22.450 --> 06:24.184
what it was you did,
what would they say?

06:24.251 --> 06:27.688
- Oh, well,
they would say, you know,

06:27.755 --> 06:32.760
probably that
my main responsibility

06:32.826 --> 06:35.162
was as a surrogate.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.500
- Surrogate.
Like...

06:39.567 --> 06:41.602
Like, a baby in you?

06:41.669 --> 06:43.904
- Yes.
- Okay. Interesting.

06:43.971 --> 06:47.508
I don't have any follow-up
questions at this moment.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.342
I mean, the ones I have,
I'm not allowed to ask.

06:49.477 --> 06:52.713
Is there anything
on here that would

06:52.780 --> 06:55.483
qualify you for this job?
- I'm certain.

06:55.483 --> 06:58.085
Could you just real quick
remind me

06:58.151 --> 07:00.821
what it is this company does?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.189
- Seriously?

07:02.255 --> 07:05.192
Wenner Platforms is the
third-largest outsourcing

07:05.258 --> 07:06.827
company for
in-website help chats.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.128
Really?
You haven't heard of us?

07:08.195 --> 07:09.930
- Of course.
Right.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.732
- I...

07:11.799 --> 07:12.933
Yeah.
I think that's probably it.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.035
- Oh.
That's it?

07:15.102 --> 07:17.070
- Thank you very much.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.039
We'll get back to you.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.641
- I'm not gonna spend
the rest of my days

07:20.708 --> 07:22.643
cleaning up after your crap.

07:22.710 --> 07:27.247
- Okay, excuse me; I have to go
offline for just an emergency.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.049
Okay.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.283
- You're a dirty bastard!

07:30.350 --> 07:31.985
- Don't talk like that!

07:32.052 --> 07:34.287
You know I love you!
- Go fuck yourself, buddy!

07:34.354 --> 07:35.989
- You're a fucking
horrible person!

07:36.056 --> 07:38.992
- I will knock you the fuck
out, you little motherfucker!

07:39.059 --> 07:40.961
- I am in a meeting!

07:42.996 --> 07:44.965
I'm sorry. There was
a brief garbage fire,

07:45.032 --> 07:48.536
and I was just violently
coughing, but I'm okay.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.403
- Kyle,
thanks for muting, dude.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.072
Oh, no problem.
Yeah.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.542
Can I get my wife committed
to an asylum for a few days

07:54.575 --> 07:55.576
just to give me a break.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.110
Is that something people do?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.112
- You know, Boss,
if you're serious about this,

07:59.179 --> 08:00.981
you can get yourself committed.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.683
And I can walk you through
how to get

08:02.750 --> 08:04.151
insurance to pay for it.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.318
- No.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.386
It wouldn't be accurate.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.955
I mean, she's the batshit one.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.657
I mean,
doctors would know instantly.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.959
- Would you consider an option

08:12.025 --> 08:13.561
where you put it
in the dishwasher?

08:13.627 --> 08:15.796
Although I'm the first to say
that hand-washing dishes

08:15.863 --> 08:17.965
is wonderfully satisfying.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.933
- He makes his own soaps
that he washes the dishes with.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.570
- I reduce solid soaps
to liquid soaps.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.138
- No way!
That wasn't even my dish!

08:25.205 --> 08:26.574
No, see?

08:26.574 --> 08:30.343
The cream cheese
has poppy seeds on it.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.980
Wasn't my bagel, okay?

08:33.046 --> 08:34.447
Mark, what would you do?

08:34.582 --> 08:36.483
- The dishes.
- Do the dishes.

08:36.584 --> 08:39.252
- This is not about dishes.
It's about power!

08:39.319 --> 08:40.721
I do the dishes, she wins.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.255
I'm surprised
you can't see that.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.924
- Kyle, nobody here is gonna
put themselves in the middle

08:43.991 --> 08:45.092
of your marriage.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.359
- Why don't you take
the dirty dish

08:46.426 --> 08:48.028
and put it with her stuff?

08:48.095 --> 08:49.997
- Yes.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.800
Yes.
This woman gets it.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.735
- Kyle, I think she's kidding.

08:54.802 --> 08:55.703
- I'm not.
You should go do it.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.337
- Ask yourself this:

08:57.404 --> 09:01.441
will putting the dish with her
stuff escalate unnecessarily...

09:01.508 --> 09:03.010
- Yes.
- Into a bigger fight?

09:03.076 --> 09:06.079
Or will it calm things down so
you two can talk through it?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.047
- No, no.
- Yes.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.281
- Eliza?

09:08.348 --> 09:09.516
- Okay.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.652
Play this out in my head.

09:11.719 --> 09:16.189
So you could wash the dish.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.191
Do it Neal's way,
which I don't know,

09:18.258 --> 09:19.760
it just kind of feels wrong.

09:19.827 --> 09:23.330
- Feels very wrong.
Be right back.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.932
See?

09:24.998 --> 09:26.266
Now I finally
have someone here

09:26.333 --> 09:27.935
who understands
relationships and seems

09:28.001 --> 09:29.202
to care about my marriage.

09:29.269 --> 09:33.006
Is that so hard?
Is that really so hard?

09:50.357 --> 09:51.925
- What you eating there, Mark?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.994
- Made it a couple nights ago.
Coq au vin.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.330
- Did someone say coq au vin?
- Uh-oh.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.933
Mark, you just pressed
Winston's starter button.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.635
- Coq au vin happens to be
my signature dish.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.270
Mark, I got a tip for you.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.437
Next time you prepare it,

10:04.504 --> 10:05.839
soak the chicken
in the red wine

10:05.906 --> 10:08.575
for a full 24 hours
before you cook it.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.609
It's a game-changer.

10:09.677 --> 10:10.577
- I use Riesling.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.112
- Oh, what?

10:12.179 --> 10:13.613
- What's it supposed to be?
- Red.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.882
Always red.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.218
- Riesling lifts out
the other flavors.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.920
Heightens them.

10:19.987 --> 10:20.788
You dig?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.155
- I do not dig.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.324
Your loss, brother.
- It's my loss, brother?

10:24.391 --> 10:25.693
Oh, I'm your brother now,
Mark, am I?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.227
Really?
I'm your brother now?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.729
I'm not your brother,
'cause you're somebody who

10:28.796 --> 10:30.263
goes out there and breaks
rules like some kind of

10:30.330 --> 10:32.032
goddamn vigilante,
and that's no brother of mine.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.801
I don't even talk
to my real brother.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.704
And for reasons
much less severe than this.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.368
- You stole
a neighbor's flower?

11:08.435 --> 11:10.237
- Dr. Martin gave it to me.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.372
- Why?
- Because he's nice to me.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.474
He doesn't need
a reason to be nice.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.010
- He's senile.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.779
- You clean that dish?

11:19.913 --> 11:22.415
- I took care of it.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.896
- Hey.
How'd it go?

11:35.963 --> 11:37.164
- It was okay.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.366
- Well, you'll find something.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.903
- No, they offered me the job.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.938
- They offered it to you?
- Yeah.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.373
- They said you have the job?

11:46.439 --> 11:47.574
- That's what they said.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.542
- They said those words?

11:49.609 --> 11:51.611
- Yeah.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.114
- Janet.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.849
- What?
- Come here.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.284
- Jesus, what?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.452
- Come here!

12:00.520 --> 12:01.889
- What the fuck is it?

12:01.955 --> 12:07.660
Eliza got the new job.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.429
- Congratulations.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.298
She never had trouble
getting the job.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.601
It was keeping the job
that was the Rubik's Cube.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.574
You know what?
Call me crazy,

12:21.641 --> 12:23.811
I think you're gonna do great
on your own.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.846
- Why would that be crazy?

12:25.913 --> 12:28.215
- I left some money for you
with your sister, all right?

12:28.281 --> 12:30.717
And it's not much, but it'll be
there for you if you need it.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.586
- Shouldn't you be
leaving money with me for her

12:33.653 --> 12:36.089
since I'm the older one?

12:36.156 --> 12:37.457
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

12:37.524 --> 12:41.061
But, you know, she's good
with money and budgets.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.296
You're the creative one.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.633
Although she's
very creative too.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.104
- What's wrong?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.472
- Why does something
have to be wrong?

12:52.539 --> 12:54.141
- Because you called me
three times in a row.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.009
- Pick up the first time
and that won't happen.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.611
- Okay, Liza, I cannot talk.
I am at work.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.147
- But this is an emergency.

13:02.749 --> 13:05.185
- Just give me one sec.

13:06.686 --> 13:07.720
Okay.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.490
- Our childhood is over.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.592
- Okay.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.375
How dare he?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.643
- It's just his opinion, dear.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.180
Get some sleep.

13:33.246 --> 13:37.050
- If you want to make
coq au vin with a Riesling,

13:37.117 --> 13:40.753
okay, I guess.

13:40.888 --> 13:44.557
But you do not get to call
it coq au vin at that point.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.927
It's white wine chicken.

13:46.994 --> 13:51.899
- Please, Winston. Okay?

14:21.661 --> 14:23.163
- Hi. Good morning.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.397
- Good morning.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.632
- Good morning.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.467
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.702
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.438
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.672
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.174
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.375
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.343
- Good--
- Hey, guys,

14:36.409 --> 14:38.211
I have a crazy idea.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.779
I know it's my first day.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.349
But how about we only say
"good morning," like,

14:42.415 --> 14:43.650
once a month,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.119
you know, and then we
can spare ourselves

14:46.186 --> 14:48.355
from this whole thing
every day,

14:48.421 --> 14:52.159
'cause that's just, like...

14:52.225 --> 14:54.962
Yeah?

14:55.028 --> 14:58.865
And then, you know,
we'd have lots of free time.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.368
- What is she talking about?

15:03.370 --> 15:04.337
- Good morning.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.838
all: Good morning.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.107
- Good morning.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.808
- In my underwear drawer,
Kyle?

15:10.110 --> 15:12.012
You think it's funny?

15:12.079 --> 15:14.581
- Oh!
What the hell?

15:14.647 --> 15:16.549
- If one of those shards
of glass

15:16.616 --> 15:18.818
end back up in
my underwear drawer,

15:18.885 --> 15:22.089
I'm gonna take it
and cut off your dick.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.991
- Ooh.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.692
- That might be difficult

15:25.758 --> 15:29.196
given your newfound allergy
to dick.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.998
- Your dick, Kyle.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.499
Your dick.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.135
I'm having an affair,
and I'm loving it.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.369
- No, you're not.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.471
We both work from home.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.773
How is that even possible?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.909
- I take walks.
- With who?

15:43.010 --> 15:44.777
- Our neighbor.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.179
- Dr. Martin?

15:46.246 --> 15:48.015
He's 78.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.749
Have fun.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.651
- He has longer balls than you.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.853
- That's not even a thing.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.789
Guys don't care
how long their balls are.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.191
- They're huge.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.093
His scrotum is huge.

16:00.160 --> 16:04.031
- It's not like it's a sign
of virility or anything.

16:04.064 --> 16:08.301
It's just--it sounds
more like a disease.

16:08.368 --> 16:12.539
- Yeah, if the disease
is having your own slack line.

16:12.605 --> 16:16.609
- It stretches with age.

16:16.676 --> 16:20.813
It's not a fair comparison.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.351
- He has a bigger scrotum.
- Stop.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.054
Stop it.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.064
I'm sorry about all that, guys.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.531
It's just my wife.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.833
She's going through
a tough time with her career,

16:40.900 --> 16:44.837
and she's also the worst
person who ever lived.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.275
The dish thing was a bad idea.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.943
- The boys literally
told you what to do, honey.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.845
- Yeah, it was hard to see
at the time.

16:52.912 --> 16:55.648
Eliza, I'm beginning
to question your judgment.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.118
Let's call this strike one.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.289
- Oh.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.532
Wow.
You're wasting no time.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.567
- They asked us
for a short escrow.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.170
And I said, "Yes, please."

17:17.237 --> 17:18.238
You were fired, weren't you?

17:20.340 --> 17:21.408
Were you terminated?

17:21.474 --> 17:22.809
- Uh-uh.
- Are you gonna be spending

17:22.875 --> 17:24.711
- 00 to- 00
at Panda Express again

17:24.777 --> 17:27.114
and pretending to go to work
like you did last time?

17:27.114 --> 17:28.315
What happened?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.749
- It's not my fault, okay?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.119
My boss just
entangled me in his marriage.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.154
- Did you sleep with him?

17:34.221 --> 17:36.256
No judgment.
- No!

17:36.323 --> 17:39.892
He just has a bad marriage
and needs my help.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.128
No judgment?

17:41.194 --> 17:43.830
- If he needs your help,
then you make sure

17:43.896 --> 17:46.533
that his marriage is the best
marriage that exists

17:46.599 --> 17:50.036
on the planet,
because now his marriage

17:50.137 --> 17:52.172
is your biggest problem.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.506
Now, what's your problem?

17:53.573 --> 17:54.507
I said, what's your problem?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.842
- Mom.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.611
- His marriage.
That's your problem.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.959
- And what do we have here?

18:13.025 --> 18:14.394
Oh!
- What is this?

18:14.461 --> 18:17.264
- Two perfectly cooked plates
of coq au vin for lunch.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.665
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.267
- Everybody,
take a look at it.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.269
That's a feast
for the eyes right there.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.304
- Awfully dark.
- That's because it's been

18:24.371 --> 18:27.807
properly soaked in a Bordeaux,
Mark.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.177
- Man, business-class meal
right in your own home.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.546
- This is really the best
coq au vin I've ever tasted.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.683
- You hear that, Mark?
I'm the best she's ever had.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.817
- I was just talking
about the chicken.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.319
- You hear that, Mark?

18:39.386 --> 18:41.821
I'm the best chicken
she's ever had.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.457
- So what does
everybody here do?

18:44.524 --> 18:45.458
- Same as you.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.659
Answer help chats.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.229
- So we're all
in a meeting forever?

18:49.296 --> 18:51.498
Well, right,
if I'm not watching,

18:51.564 --> 18:53.400
you'll just wank all day.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.668
- Well, that's unlikely.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.669
I mean, Mark might do that.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.671
- I--
- Not Margie.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.808
- You don't think that I...
myself?

19:01.874 --> 19:04.977
- Sometimes she has to, 'cause
I can't always get her there.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.646
Not due to a lack of trying.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.848
- But sometimes the trying
is what doesn't get me there.

19:08.915 --> 19:09.816
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you always say,

19:09.882 --> 19:11.418
"I'm trying. I'm trying."

19:11.484 --> 19:15.988
- Sorry, I have, like, a full
life with, like, women in it.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.490
I've known all kinds of women.
- No, I was just--

19:17.557 --> 19:18.825
- Along with a lack of semen,
I also have

19:18.891 --> 19:20.227
a lot of blood flow issues.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.228
Sometimes
when I get an erection

19:21.228 --> 19:22.862
my fingertips get very cold.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.231
- Yeah.
No, I was just trying to

19:24.231 --> 19:25.498
save you all
from an endless meeting, but--

19:25.565 --> 19:27.600
- I'm sorry,
did you say endless meeting?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.269
Wow.
This is where we work.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.138
- Yeah. Sure. But--
- This is our office.

19:32.239 --> 19:36.843
And I'm sorry, with all due
respect, you're stuck in 2018.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.912
Who don't you go back in your
time machine and go to a land

19:39.979 --> 19:43.049
where everybody went
to the physical office?

19:43.115 --> 19:45.252
Enjoy Meghan Markle's wedding.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.921
Spoiler alert: she thinks
being a princess sucks.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.924
Oh.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.726
Just got an email
from Mr. Donahue.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.363
He is gonna join us for
our video conference later.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.864
- Oh, I miss him.
- Oh, okay.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.899
- Something up?
- Nah, it's just an update

19:59.966 --> 20:01.534
on the sale of our company.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.737
- The what?
- Oh, haven't I mentioned it?

20:04.804 --> 20:08.207
Yeah, we've been bought
by a Mexican technology company

20:08.275 --> 20:09.542
with an active investment arm.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.177
Yeah, I'm sure I told
you guys about that.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.712
- Our jobs,
are they in danger?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.846
- Why would they be?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.715
- My sister-in-law
lost her job

20:15.782 --> 20:17.384
when Exxon-Mobil
bought The Gap.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.951
- Not sure that happened,
Margie.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.119
- No, it really did.

20:20.186 --> 20:23.923
We even loaned her
a lot of money.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.992
Winston, she got us again.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.027
- God,
I don't want to stereotype,

20:28.094 --> 20:31.564
because lord knows I hate
when that's being done to me.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.400
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- But if we're being bought

20:33.466 --> 20:38.271
by a German company, half of us
would go, absolutely.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.672
But the Mexicans?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.842
In terms of efficiency,
they have a different--

20:42.909 --> 20:45.378
wait for it...
- Nope.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.580
Oh, no.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.648
Nope.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.317
- Culture.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.751
- Huh.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.753
- Just try and give us
some warning, okay?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.355
I've got bills,
and to find a job

20:55.422 --> 20:56.756
that pays as much
as this one

20:56.823 --> 20:58.491
is gonna take me
at least a week.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.596
Huh-duh, duh-dee-ba-duh.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.598
You know what?
It's your choice

21:05.665 --> 21:07.567
to be unskilled workers.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.970
You know, really, you should
appreciate what you got, okay?

21:11.037 --> 21:13.005
Because there's
not a lot of jobs

21:13.072 --> 21:16.142
like this in which
absolutely anybody can do.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.345
- How about a "Babe" break?

21:18.345 --> 21:21.047
- Oh, yeah.
- A what?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.181
- All right, let's do it.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.983
- Oh, good!
- Where are we now?

21:24.050 --> 21:26.218
- Farmer Hogget
can't get Babe to eat.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.187
- Okay, shh-shh.
Okay, here we go.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.686
- Man, it's like serotonin,
you know?

21:59.752 --> 22:01.954
- Oh,
I'm so glad Babe's eating.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.390
- So glad.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.824
- Your head is very heavy.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.197
- Ah!

22:11.263 --> 22:13.733
- Whoo!
- Presto!

22:13.800 --> 22:15.402
- Paris!
- Paris!

22:15.468 --> 22:17.203
Mmm, that's not good.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.237
I think that went bad.
- No.

22:18.304 --> 22:19.406
- I wouldn't drink it.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.742
- I feel like
I've brought up, like,

22:22.809 --> 22:24.444
our official insemination
a couple times.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.712
- Mm-hmm.
- And we've kind of

22:25.778 --> 22:27.079
maybe glossed that over.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.115
- Oh, I don't want to spend
the money on that.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.216
I'll say it again.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.752
Maybe your friend Bill.

22:32.819 --> 22:33.853
- Bill?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.422
- Mm-hmm.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.989
- I'd like to find
a guy who's exactly like me,

22:37.056 --> 22:41.093
except with a full-functioning
reproductive system.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.062
- I know, but we don't talk
to your brother anymore.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.897
- Yeah, after 8 1/2 years
of radio silence,

22:44.964 --> 22:47.133
I feel like I gotta take
my brother out to a dinner

22:47.199 --> 22:48.968
first or something.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.169
- I can't.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.004
I can't deal
with the family stuff.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.574
- No, I know.

22:54.641 --> 22:57.243
We also haven't fully
discussed the methodology

22:57.309 --> 22:59.278
by which we would procure
the genetic material

22:59.345 --> 23:00.447
from Bill if it was Bill.

23:00.447 --> 23:01.848
- Well,
we would sleep together.

23:01.914 --> 23:06.619
- Okay, can we just work
like a normal working work?

23:06.686 --> 23:08.988
- You...
you okay over there, Kyle?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.022
- Fine.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.559
- You got to pee, Boss?

23:12.625 --> 23:13.693
- Why don't you go
and do that then?

23:13.760 --> 23:15.227
- I can't.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.763
- Why can't you pee, sweetie?

23:16.829 --> 23:18.164
- I have that.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.166
Eventually it feels like
I'm hanging on to so little

23:20.232 --> 23:21.468
that I don't want
to let anything go.

23:21.501 --> 23:24.837
- Look,
Ally and I had a fight,

23:24.904 --> 23:27.874
and I said I'm not coming out
until she apologies,

23:27.940 --> 23:29.375
which she hasn't.

23:29.476 --> 23:32.645
So she can't see me
leave this room.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.213
- That's so stupid.
Just go pee.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.215
- Just go talk to your wife.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.884
I mean,
you see that, don't you?

23:37.950 --> 23:40.219
Like,
how incredibly obvious it is?

23:40.286 --> 23:43.590
- No, Neal.
I see nothing.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.291
Eliza?

23:45.357 --> 23:47.259
- You leave the room, she wins.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.295
- God, you get it!

23:49.361 --> 23:50.797
Yes!
- No, dear,

23:50.863 --> 23:53.299
that is not exactly
practical advice now, is it?

23:53.365 --> 23:56.536
- I hear you, Margie, but this
feels like, if Kyle gives in,

23:56.603 --> 23:58.805
Ally will just pull
the same shit next week.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.508
- Right. Right.
That is my concern as well.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.842
- Can you crawl out
under her view?

24:02.909 --> 24:04.911
- Like a coward?
- Yeah, like a coward.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.513
- I can try.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.648
- Nothing cowardly
about crawling on your belly.

24:08.715 --> 24:11.283
If you were a snake, you'd
think walking was cowardly.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.446
- It's a no-go.
- Maybe a window?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.181
- Use the toilet, Kyle.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.551
- Use a window, Kyle.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.285
- Hello?
Is this the meeting?

24:46.352 --> 24:47.954
Did I get the right place?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.321
- Oh, fuck.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.091
It's me, Mr. Donahue.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.727
- Hey, Mr. Donahue.
- Have you guys all met Ernie?

24:54.794 --> 24:56.262
Huh?
Say hi, Ernie.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.830
Say hi, Ernie.
- Hi, Ernie.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.866
- Ah, there we go.

24:59.932 --> 25:03.135
That's Ernie for, "Hi, there."

25:03.202 --> 25:04.470
Did everybody say hi?

25:04.571 --> 25:05.705
I didn't know
if anyone was on mute.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.339
- What can we do for you?
- Oh, right.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.208
As you have no doubt
all heard by now,

25:09.275 --> 25:12.912
our little gem of a company
has been acquired

25:12.979 --> 25:16.783
by Quintana Sistemas
de Información.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.385
based in Quintanas, Mexico.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.853
I had to look up
where that is.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.989
It's kind of
the New Mexico of Mexico.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.592
- Cool, cool, cool.
Anything else?

25:25.625 --> 25:26.593
- Ernie, you need to go out?

25:26.626 --> 25:28.227
You do, don't you?

25:28.294 --> 25:31.463
I can feel the tremors from his
bladder when he has to go out.

25:31.598 --> 25:32.398
What? Okay. Okay.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.500
Hold your horses there.

25:34.601 --> 25:35.968
Okay.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.837
There you go.
You just do your business.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.273
Look at it all coming out.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.609
Wow.

25:42.675 --> 25:45.477
Good, strong stream.
Good, strong stream.

25:45.612 --> 25:46.946
- Oh...
- Fuck.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.047
- You're gonna be like
a deflated beach ball.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.649
Oh, I'm proud of you.
- Fuck.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.350
- Okay. Now it's just drips.
- Fuck.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.452
- You did it again.
Come on, Ernie. Here we go.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.955
After he pees,
he likes to stare at the wall.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.390
There's one wall
that he just loves.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.826
Where was I?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.695
Yes, so the Sistemas
folks are gonna

26:02.762 --> 26:04.063
be arriving here next month.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.866
I thought we should throw
them a welcoming party.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.468
Good chance for everyone
to meet.

26:09.535 --> 26:12.672
And I hope that each one
of you will be in attendance.

26:12.739 --> 26:17.009
- Do you think you could
just email us the rest?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.411
I'm sorry,
we're very--we're very busy.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.313
- Okay, well,
the last thing on my agenda,

26:21.380 --> 26:25.484
I want to do a presentation
for everyone

26:25.551 --> 26:28.520
so they know what
to expect in the new merger.

26:28.655 --> 26:31.858
I think do it in person, you
know, get everyone together.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.126
Kyle, if you were
to have it at your place,

26:34.193 --> 26:36.863
there would be an extra $15
to cover whatever

26:36.929 --> 26:41.768
electricity is used, water.

26:41.834 --> 26:45.104
If that sounds good to you,
then I say snap it up.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.072
There you go.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.674
It was great to see everyone.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.108
- Bye.

26:49.175 --> 26:53.579
- And I will end
the call on my end...

26:53.680 --> 26:55.381
- Goodbye.
- Now.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.483
- Goodbye.

26:57.549 --> 26:58.584
- Oh,
it's right there.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.352
- Okay, I'm looking for End.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.922
- It's the bottom left.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.090
- Oh, I see Leave Meeting.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.357
Okay.
- Yep.

27:05.424 --> 27:10.296
- And Leave Meeting
in three, two, one.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.363
Nope.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.733
- Do I say it?

27:13.800 --> 27:15.802
Leave meeting.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.336
Leave meeting.

27:17.403 --> 27:22.975
I'll tell you what, I'm
gonna unplug it at the wall.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.711
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.813
Oh, God.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.387
- You okay, Boss?

27:35.454 --> 27:36.388
- I just need a minute.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.890
- Oh, dear God.

27:37.957 --> 27:41.527
- Did you not just hear
me say use the toilet?

27:41.593 --> 27:43.229
- Can't stop now.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.238
Ahh.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.413
Ahh.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.582
The window was
the winning idea, Eliza.

28:03.649 --> 28:04.884
Good work.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.786
I didn't know you had
that much ambition.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.755
Coming after my job.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.892
- Kyle. Open up.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.527
- You have your apology ready?

28:15.594 --> 28:17.897
- Dr. Martin is here.

28:17.964 --> 28:20.299
- Tell him I'm working,
and if he needs help

28:20.366 --> 28:22.634
starting his heart,
he should call 911.

28:22.769 --> 28:26.873
- Kyle, I'd appreciate
a minute of your time.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.157
- Oh, hey, guys.
What a pleasant surprise.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.094
- What is in here?
What's going on?

28:48.160 --> 28:52.899
- My wife said you defecated
on your own shrubbery

28:52.965 --> 28:54.133
from high up.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.802
- That's ridiculous.
- I told him that.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.036
I told him that.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.939
- Look,
what you're saying is absurd.

29:00.006 --> 29:02.708
Why would anyone do that when
they have a toilet available?

29:02.809 --> 29:06.678
- She says you tried
to aim a turd right on her.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.280
- That's not even possible.

29:08.347 --> 29:11.283
Like, the anus can't throw.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.823
No. Hey, please,
the window is stuck.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.057
It hasn't opened in years.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.191
You're gonna throw
out your back.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.392
- Oh--
- Oh, are you okay?

29:20.459 --> 29:21.928
Oh, sir, sir.
- I got it. I got it.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.530
I got it. Let me get it.
Let me get it.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.366
- Oh, no, Kyle.
- Oh, God, what?

29:27.433 --> 29:31.737
- God, Kyle!
- Oh, just tell me why.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.940
- I don't smell anything.

29:34.006 --> 29:37.043
- What paths
have you chosen as a man?

29:37.109 --> 29:39.211
- You still owe me an apology.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.859
- I am so sorry, Dr. Martin.

29:52.859 --> 29:56.328
- I just don't understand how
something like this happens.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.630
- I just don't understand
our marriage right now.

29:58.697 --> 30:01.600
All we do is fight
all the time.

30:01.667 --> 30:02.935
I don't know what to do
with this guy.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.104
- Oh, honey,
it's gonna be okay.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.406
Marriage is a long
and winding path.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.507
Sometimes it's all muddy
for a while.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.876
- Fuck you.

30:09.942 --> 30:12.611
- Woods are unpredictable.

30:12.678 --> 30:16.448
Sometimes you go
in the woods and poop.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.918
And maybe that's
what happened today.

30:18.985 --> 30:23.755
Oh.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.292
Nice. Uh...

30:33.132 --> 30:36.602
Eliza, the window
was an atrocious idea.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.737
Really, just awful.

30:38.804 --> 30:43.442
Strike two.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.711
- I feel like
we're forgetting something.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.013
- You're not. There's--
- All right, don't--

30:47.079 --> 30:48.680
what are you throwing?

30:48.747 --> 30:50.049
She doesn't know
what's in that bag.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.717
All right, give me a hug.
I feel--

30:51.783 --> 30:54.086
I have mixed emotions
about this.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.354
You all right?
You okay?

30:55.421 --> 30:56.889
- No.
- I want to check in.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.891
- If you want to go to Jamba
Juice get in the car first.

31:13.305 --> 31:16.308
- Oh, nightstand.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.411
- Do you need help?
- No, I got it.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.717
- Well, it's your place, so...

31:25.784 --> 31:27.954
- Here's the thing, I give my
boss the kind of relationship

31:28.020 --> 31:31.423
advice he wants to hear,
and then when things go wrong,

31:31.490 --> 31:33.092
he punishes me.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.527
I think I have, like, two
strikes against me already.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.264
But the second one
I can't argue with.

31:50.977 --> 31:55.982
- I think my running shoes
are older than you are.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.049
I thought we might--

31:57.116 --> 32:00.652
- Give me that.

32:02.654 --> 32:06.358
We gonna do this.
- We gonna do this.

32:13.032 --> 32:16.102
- Long run?

32:21.007 --> 32:25.411
I'll allow it.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.817
- Hmm.

32:31.883 --> 32:34.320
- Hey.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.523
- Hi.
You have legs.

32:37.589 --> 32:38.757
- Yeah, you do too.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.792
- Shall we?
- Yeah, yeah, we should.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.767
What?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.141
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

32:55.207 --> 32:56.875
Nothing. Nothing.

33:00.179 --> 33:03.182
I just--I thought you
were gonna ask me out.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.250
- What's up, winners?

33:04.316 --> 33:06.352
- Hey!
- Hi. Come on in.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.054
Fashionably late.
- Hey.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.421
- Come on in.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.523
Okay.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.159
I think that should do it.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.493
Okay, yeah.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.529
Sorry for the delay,
but this presentation

33:17.596 --> 33:19.598
was prepared
by Mr. Donahue and myself

33:19.665 --> 33:22.768
just to walk everyone
through what to expect

33:22.834 --> 33:26.072
when Wenner Platforms
transforms

33:26.105 --> 33:30.509
into Wenner Platforms,
A division of...

33:30.576 --> 33:31.877
- So that's
our new company name?

33:31.943 --> 33:33.945
Wenner Platforms,
A division of?

33:34.080 --> 33:35.414
- It is.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.116
- Maybe the next slide, Kyle.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.684
- Shut up, Mark.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.752
Okay.
That's the full name.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.155
Quintana Sistemas
de Información.

33:43.222 --> 33:47.226
So that is all the
información you need.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.996
Okay. Wow.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.331
Any questions?

33:52.398 --> 33:54.833
This is what the dilemma is.

33:54.900 --> 33:58.003
Like, you're saying,
"Hey, dog,

33:58.104 --> 34:00.606
how are we gonna
combine these companies, bro?"

34:00.672 --> 34:03.309
Well, I'll answer it, bro.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.676
Vertical integration.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.212
Put companies
on top of each other.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.979
Make a big building.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.282
Practical integration, email--

34:10.349 --> 34:12.584
- Uh-oh.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.754
Does that mean that we all have
to get new email addresses?

34:16.822 --> 34:19.125
- Been looking at this all day.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.426
- Yeah, I mean...
- Can smell the cinnamon.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.727
- Perhaps, you know--

34:21.793 --> 34:23.462
- Tennessee,
that is for everyone.

34:23.529 --> 34:24.796
- Yeah, I'll share it.
- That's an absurd amount.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.598
- I really just want the fruit.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.335
- Then have an apple.
- Ally!

34:29.401 --> 34:32.804
Ally! Ally!

34:32.871 --> 34:34.373
- What does she...

34:34.440 --> 34:38.177
- Ally! Ally!

34:39.778 --> 34:41.413
- Hey, Mrs. Martin.
How are you?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.714
- How could you?

34:42.781 --> 34:44.883
- Mrs. Martin?
- Oh, don't.

34:44.950 --> 34:48.154
Why would you do that?

34:48.187 --> 34:49.955
- Mrs. Martin,
can we talk about this

34:50.021 --> 34:51.190
another time, please?
- No.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.759
Now.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.894
- When two people
are in a relationship,

34:55.961 --> 34:57.963
and one of them
is in a wheelchair,

34:58.029 --> 35:01.900
the other person is allowed
to have his needs satisfied.

35:01.967 --> 35:04.570
- I satisfy his needs.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.773
- How?

35:07.839 --> 35:08.840
How did you even find out?

35:08.907 --> 35:10.176
- He told me.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.843
- Well, why are you not yelling
at him?

35:11.910 --> 35:13.579
- I did.
But an 80-year-old man

35:13.645 --> 35:15.681
doesn't exactly have
a lot of defenses

35:15.747 --> 35:18.016
against a young seductress.

35:18.083 --> 35:21.187
You know, someday you'll
care about your marriage,

35:21.187 --> 35:24.022
and then you'll know what
it means to respect the ring.

35:24.089 --> 35:27.058
I do not have time for this.

35:27.193 --> 35:29.261
- Ally.
Open the door.

35:29.328 --> 35:32.198
- What have you done, Ally?
- He loves my art!

35:32.198 --> 35:36.235
- Oh, he's the one?
Open the door and face her.

35:36.302 --> 35:37.269
- No.
- Yes.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.370
- No. No.
- Open.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.371
- No. No.
- Open the door.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.372
- No.
- Open the door.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.307
- No.
- Open the door.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.108
- No.

35:43.209 --> 35:46.378
No. No.

35:46.445 --> 35:49.281
- Strong! Fuck.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.850
Ow. Ow! My rib!

35:51.917 --> 35:54.085
- Go do your meeting, Kyle.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.521
No. No.

35:55.587 --> 35:56.688
- Open the door.
- No.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.490
- I need to get the mail.
- The mail?

35:58.557 --> 35:59.791
- Yes.
- I'll get the mail.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.026
- I'll get the mail,
but I promise not to--

36:01.092 --> 36:02.394
- I'll get the mail.
I'll get the mail.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.530
- No, I'll get the mail.
No, I'll get the mail.

36:04.596 --> 36:08.767
- You can't look me in the eye,
but you can take a scrotum

36:08.834 --> 36:10.536
that's three quarters
of a century old

36:10.602 --> 36:12.938
and stick it in your mouth?

36:17.676 --> 36:18.777
Hey!

36:18.844 --> 36:21.513
Wait till NextDoor
hears about this.

36:21.580 --> 36:26.418
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Ha.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.934
- Uh...so let's see.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.503
Where were we?

36:45.837 --> 36:48.740
Email. Ooh.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.942
And payroll.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.344
- Maybe we should stop.
- Yeah.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.612
- Yeah?
- What a good idea.

36:53.679 --> 36:54.746
- Why don't we take
a little break, huh?

36:54.813 --> 36:55.914
- I'd like to--
I'd like to stop.

36:55.981 --> 36:58.183
- Dude, I'm sorry, man.
Like, oof.

36:58.284 --> 37:00.519
- Maybe you'd like to listen
to a certain piece of music

37:00.586 --> 37:02.621
that makes you feel
a certain way.

37:02.688 --> 37:09.060
- I have an acoustic playlist
that I love.

37:09.127 --> 37:13.365
Um...it's got Sam Smith
and--

37:13.432 --> 37:16.502
and Indigo Girls.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.340
- Let me...

37:21.407 --> 37:24.009
- Uh, I need--
- Let me just help you.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.313
Great.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.694
Great.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.764
- What do we do?

37:45.831 --> 37:46.932
- I don't see you two together.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.200
- Oh...we're not.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.902
But thank you so much
for sensing

37:50.969 --> 37:52.103
how much I wanted your input.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.505
- Sure.
- Yeah.

37:53.572 --> 37:56.375
- It's just, when
a surrogate carries a baby...

37:56.442 --> 37:58.744
- Uh-huh.
- Stray DNA seeps out

37:58.810 --> 38:02.614
of the baby and goes straight
up to the mother's brain.

38:02.681 --> 38:06.685
I mean, damages
can't be known for years.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.388
- I'm just being
results-oriented here.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.222
You could have an affair
of your own.

38:11.357 --> 38:13.625
- Oh. Okay.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.894
Well, I didn't expect you
to go in that direction.

38:15.961 --> 38:19.731
- Like, that would really
balance out the seesaw.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.734
- Balance out the seesaw.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.803
Seesaw of revenge.

38:24.870 --> 38:25.971
- I don't think it's revenge.

38:26.037 --> 38:29.207
I think it's more justice,
you know?

38:29.274 --> 38:34.145
- The scales of vengeance.

38:34.212 --> 38:36.882
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:36.948 --> 38:37.816
Good work.
Good work, Eliza.

38:52.731 --> 38:55.534
- So I don't think
I should ask you out.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.102
- Oh.
- I mean, you know,

38:57.168 --> 38:58.770
mixing work and dating,

38:58.837 --> 39:03.609
especially in today's
climate, is kind of dangerous.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.011
- Will you give me a ride to
the company party next week?

39:06.077 --> 39:07.846
- Sure.
- Great.

39:07.913 --> 39:10.582
It's a date.
- I didn't say it was a date.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.918
- Yeah, I know.
I--I said that.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.152
- No. It's not a date.

39:14.219 --> 39:15.854
- No, totally not a date.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.128
- Excuse me, everybody.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.763
Sorry to bother you, okay?

39:24.830 --> 39:27.232
Wanted to invite you
to a special gathering

39:27.298 --> 39:28.967
for Margie's birthday.

39:29.034 --> 39:29.968
- Oh!
Dope. Phenomenal.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.603
- Okay.
- Nice.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.639
- Yeah, we're gonna do
it Tuesday night.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.274
- Tuesday is the company party.
- Exactly.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.477
We're gonna do this party
inside that party.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.711
- What does that mean?

39:39.778 --> 39:41.447
- We'll have a table
set aside.

39:41.513 --> 39:42.714
We'll do gifts for her there.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.450
We'll stick a candle
in the dessert.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.617
She's gonna love it.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.719
- Okay, but can we agree
to cap the gift?

39:47.786 --> 39:49.755
I don't want to be the
a-hole who spent the most.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.122
- I just don't think
I understand

39:51.189 --> 39:52.658
what you're planning.
- She's coming back.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.860
Don't say another
word about it, okay?

39:54.926 --> 39:58.329
Shut--Mark, shut up.

39:58.464 --> 39:59.831
- Oh, you know what?

39:59.898 --> 40:02.734
While I have everyone,
my birthday's coming up,

40:02.801 --> 40:05.771
and I was thinking in three
Saturdays from this Saturday

40:05.837 --> 40:07.606
if everyone wanted
to come over.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.278
Are you pointing at me?

40:14.212 --> 40:17.015
I just want to do something
special for my birthday,

40:17.082 --> 40:18.216
and I...

40:25.857 --> 40:28.326
- Yo!

40:28.393 --> 40:30.596
The door is right there.

40:30.662 --> 40:31.863
- That's not obvious.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.364
- Mailman finds it.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.601
- I think he's got it
memorized.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.936
You know, it is so weird
to walk into a room

40:38.003 --> 40:41.807
I'm extremely familiar with
from this angle only.

40:41.873 --> 40:45.410
Um, uh, our folks.
- Don't--

40:45.477 --> 40:47.045
- Should I get this for you?
- No.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.014
Leave it.
Just leave it.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.216
They moved to Paris,
and they're calling to gloat.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.784
- I think you should take it.

40:52.851 --> 40:53.819
- Why?

40:53.885 --> 40:56.522
- Out of respect
for your parents?

40:56.588 --> 40:58.824
- I don't follow.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.827
No. Neal.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.529
No.

41:03.529 --> 41:05.363
- Bonjour, sweetie.

41:05.430 --> 41:08.667
Je FaceTime-ing de Paris.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.336
- Did you find an apartment?

41:11.402 --> 41:12.538
- Better.

41:12.604 --> 41:16.074
We found a foot on the ground.

41:16.141 --> 41:19.410
That's the literal
translation for pied-a-terre.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.412
- Wow.
- "Pied" is "foot."

41:21.547 --> 41:22.914
"Terre" is "ground."

41:22.981 --> 41:24.883
- Honey, she doesn't care.
- I find it interesting.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.218
- So do you still
have the job?

41:27.285 --> 41:28.286
- Yeah.
Why wouldn't I?

41:28.353 --> 41:29.655
- Okay.

41:29.721 --> 41:30.922
We're just gonna
pretend that the last

41:30.989 --> 41:31.790
28 years never happened.
That's okay.

41:31.857 --> 41:32.791
See what I'm up against?

41:32.858 --> 41:34.626
Did Ro give you the number?

41:34.693 --> 41:35.994
- What number?
- Our old lawyer.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.896
She can help you
with that surrogacy money.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.698
- Janet, stop.
- Who gets pregnant for free?

41:39.765 --> 41:41.767
- She made a decision.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.334
- Well,
I want you to call her.

41:43.401 --> 41:44.936
She might be dead now,
but still, give her a call.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.205
Okay? Bye-bye.
Bonjour.

41:47.272 --> 41:49.708
- You know what? I actually
have to go too, so...

41:49.775 --> 41:51.843
- Are you eating well?

41:51.910 --> 41:53.244
- Yeah.

41:53.311 --> 41:55.714
- Hey, good for you
not accepting the money.

41:55.781 --> 41:57.983
You were a crappy surrogate.
That's integrity.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.585
- Okay.
- Guess what the first

41:59.651 --> 42:01.587
French stethoscope was.

42:01.587 --> 42:03.755
A wooden flute.

42:03.822 --> 42:06.091
This whole country is a song.

42:23.341 --> 42:25.043
- Ah! Augh, dang it.

42:25.110 --> 42:26.612
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah,

42:26.612 --> 42:29.247
I think my leg's
messing with me.

42:29.314 --> 42:30.481
Hey, look what's over here.

42:30.616 --> 42:32.718
It's an invisible cane
over here.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.085
And I think
that's gonna help me walk.

42:34.152 --> 42:35.621
We can keep walking.
Come on, now.

42:35.621 --> 42:38.423
Keep up, now.
Come on.

42:38.489 --> 42:41.092
Wait a second.
My other leg's messing with me.

42:41.159 --> 42:43.662
- Oh, both legs.
- Both of them are messed up.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.631
And look over here.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.032
It's an invisible walker.

42:47.098 --> 42:48.700
My luck has changed.
Look at that.

42:48.767 --> 42:50.802
- Oh, my God.
- I'll take that.

42:50.869 --> 42:52.337
Put it right here.

42:52.403 --> 42:56.642
Ooh, I'm way too young to be
feeling like this, you know.

42:56.642 --> 42:58.476
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, wait a second.

42:58.543 --> 43:01.246
My wrists are hurting me.
They're hurting me really bad.

43:01.312 --> 43:04.449
Can you please just take this
invisible walker from me?

43:04.515 --> 43:05.851
- You want me to take it?

43:05.917 --> 43:08.319
- Yeah.
There you go.

43:08.386 --> 43:09.655
Yeah.
There it is.

43:09.655 --> 43:11.422
Okay.
All right.

43:11.489 --> 43:12.691
All right.

43:12.758 --> 43:14.125
You look good walking
with that walker.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.361
Oh.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.665
Ma'am, I can't move
if I don't have my walker,

43:19.665 --> 43:21.466
so could you please help me?

43:21.532 --> 43:23.201
Just lift me up a little?

43:23.268 --> 43:25.871
- Yeah, I got you.
- Just help me, please.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.005
Yeah, you get it.

43:27.072 --> 43:28.807
All right.
All right.

43:28.874 --> 43:30.141
You know, you are way
smarter than your parents

43:30.208 --> 43:32.778
give you credit for, you know?

43:52.263 --> 43:53.732
- Hey.

43:57.936 --> 44:01.539
- I can't believe
my father is retiring.

44:01.606 --> 44:03.474
When he started
Frames & More

44:03.541 --> 44:07.879
before I was born,
it was just a single store.

44:07.946 --> 44:11.082
He never even dreamed
it would be two stores.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.819
And now look at us.
Two stores!

44:14.920 --> 44:16.187
- Hello, everyone.
Hello.

44:16.254 --> 44:18.356
Oh, so good to see everyone.

44:18.423 --> 44:20.591
Good evening,
and hola evening.

44:20.726 --> 44:21.960
- Excuse me.

44:22.027 --> 44:24.262
You obviously heard me
giving a toast.

44:24.329 --> 44:26.031
- So good to see you all here,

44:26.097 --> 44:27.165
and I'm glad
that no one got caught

44:27.232 --> 44:29.500
in that accident on Route 15.

44:29.567 --> 44:31.737
From what I saw,
it was pretty rough stuff,

44:31.803 --> 44:34.439
and I hope no children
were badly hurt.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.541
Okay.
It gives me great pleasure

44:36.607 --> 44:38.409
to introduce our new owner.

44:38.476 --> 44:41.847
He is a man from another
culture, the Mexican culture,

44:41.913 --> 44:44.115
which they've been
in the news a lot lately,

44:44.182 --> 44:46.451
as you know,
viz-a-viz the border.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.920
Wherever you stand politically,
I think we can all agree

44:48.987 --> 44:51.923
that the separating
of families,

44:51.990 --> 44:55.126
however well-intentioned,
was clearly ineffective.

44:55.193 --> 45:00.799
And for that,
on behalf of our country,

45:00.866 --> 45:05.103
I hereby formally apologize.

45:05.170 --> 45:09.775
And now please welcome
Senor X Fernandez!

45:09.841 --> 45:11.442
- Thank you.

45:11.509 --> 45:13.478
I had no idea
any of that was going on.

45:13.544 --> 45:14.679
The only American news
I watch is tennis.

45:14.780 --> 45:15.914
- Oh.

45:27.125 --> 45:30.628
- My name is Sergio Fernandez.

45:30.695 --> 45:32.463
I buy good companies,

45:32.530 --> 45:36.434
and I make them
fantastic companies.

45:36.501 --> 45:40.906
My father lets me buy
one company every two years.

45:40.972 --> 45:42.440
I pick it.

45:42.507 --> 45:43.875
I buy it.

45:43.942 --> 45:45.643
I turn it around.

45:45.710 --> 45:48.613
Let's see what I can do.
Three companies so far.

45:48.679 --> 45:52.818
First and third, big successes.
Big.

45:52.851 --> 45:55.453
Middle one was difficult,
because

45:55.520 --> 45:58.689
I started to build a house,
right,

45:58.824 --> 46:02.493
and a lot of little details.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.529
A lot of tiny decisions
to make.

46:04.595 --> 46:09.667
In the middle of it,
my contractor went bankrupt.

46:09.734 --> 46:12.070
It's a crazy story.

46:12.137 --> 46:14.272
The house came out great,
two swimming pools.

46:14.339 --> 46:15.974
Wonderful. In Montecito.
Gorgeous.

46:16.041 --> 46:18.376
- It sounds like it's stunning.

46:18.443 --> 46:21.246
- I know, and I couldn't
enjoy it for a while,

46:21.312 --> 46:24.015
because the company...

46:24.082 --> 46:25.851
and a lot of people
lost their jobs.

46:25.917 --> 46:29.587
It was a family owned company,
not unlike--and--

46:29.654 --> 46:30.856
but you know what?
You live and learn.

46:30.856 --> 46:32.390
And I'll never touch
textiles again.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.325
Anyway, look, that's done.

46:34.392 --> 46:38.563
My vision for this company
is big.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.566
I ask you,
how big is your vision?

46:41.632 --> 46:43.401
Triple it!

46:43.468 --> 46:47.305
You folks make so many sales
a year, like, X sales.

46:47.372 --> 46:52.210
Well, imagine 3X sales!

46:52.277 --> 46:54.012
There's nothing we can't do!

46:54.079 --> 46:55.981
We work hard.

46:56.047 --> 46:57.448
We work harder.

46:57.515 --> 47:01.252
Till we are as hard as a rock.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.721
Tonight we celebrate
our new strength.

47:03.788 --> 47:05.756
Tonight is champagne.
Tonight is caviar.

47:05.891 --> 47:08.559
Tonight is coke
off each other's tits.

47:08.626 --> 47:10.361
Questions.

47:10.428 --> 47:13.064
Sir.
- Are we gonna have new emails?

47:13.131 --> 47:15.500
- We are.

47:15.566 --> 47:16.902
Yes.

47:16.902 --> 47:18.904
- Are we gonna have access
to the old emails?

47:18.937 --> 47:21.572
'Cause, you know,
I reference those with clients.

47:21.639 --> 47:22.908
- That's wonderful.
That's a follow-up,

47:22.974 --> 47:24.609
and we thank you for that.

47:24.675 --> 47:27.112
That's a question for IT.
- Okay.

47:27.178 --> 47:30.548
- But if that functionality is
available, you will have it.

47:30.615 --> 47:32.017
Yes.

47:32.083 --> 47:34.119
Yellow dress.
- Oh, thank you.

47:34.185 --> 47:36.521
I've had it since college.

47:36.587 --> 47:38.789
With the email address,
will we be able

47:38.924 --> 47:42.460
to forward from our old
email address

47:42.527 --> 47:44.495
to our new email address or...

47:45.964 --> 47:47.232
- Attention, everybody.

47:47.298 --> 47:49.434
This is not just
a simple work function.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.436
It's also a birthday party.

47:51.502 --> 47:55.640
all: Happy birthday!

47:55.706 --> 47:56.975
- What are you--what are
you--what are you doing?

47:57.042 --> 47:58.643
- I wanted to have a
little surprise for you.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.545
Party inside a party.
Are you surprised?

48:00.611 --> 48:02.380
- Yes, dear,
I am very surprised.

48:02.447 --> 48:04.682
- Good.
- Thank you.

48:04.749 --> 48:05.984
- I didn't get her anything.

48:06.051 --> 48:07.552
- All that matters
is that you're here.

48:07.618 --> 48:08.786
- Got you that.

48:08.853 --> 48:10.021
- Winston,
we said no gifts this year.

48:10.088 --> 48:12.357
- I'm sorry.
My passion for you, it's--

48:12.423 --> 48:14.525
- Come here for a second.
- I had to.

48:14.592 --> 48:17.362
- She's meeting me here.

48:17.428 --> 48:18.829
- She's gorgeous.

48:18.964 --> 48:20.765
- Yes.
- Oh, it's magnificent.

48:20.831 --> 48:24.769
- You said I'm up or down
for anything or anyone.

48:24.835 --> 48:27.105
- Yeah, I needed results, so...

48:27.172 --> 48:28.506
- Why up or down?

48:28.573 --> 48:30.441
- Well, I forgot
which way was more fun.

48:30.508 --> 48:32.677
- Thank you.
- I guess they both work.

48:32.743 --> 48:34.345
- I hope you like it.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.114
- Oh. Oh.

48:36.181 --> 48:37.983
- Oh, my God.

48:38.049 --> 48:39.584
- Hopefully, this spices
things up for you guys.

48:39.650 --> 48:41.219
- Wow.
- I have a cousin

48:41.286 --> 48:43.221
in the nightgown business,

48:43.288 --> 48:46.424
and this is a typical lattice.

48:46.491 --> 48:48.093
Do you mind displaying it
on your body?

48:48.159 --> 48:49.360
- On my body?
- Yeah.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.361
- You don't have to--
you don't have to.

48:50.428 --> 48:52.130
Absolutely.
Don't worry.

48:52.197 --> 48:54.365
I'm happily married,
so just--

48:54.432 --> 48:56.401
- It looks so breathable.

48:56.467 --> 48:58.269
And red is Bill's
favorite color.

48:58.336 --> 49:01.139
That's wonderful.

49:02.840 --> 49:06.011
Bill's the man she hopes will
contribute semen to our quest

49:06.044 --> 49:08.846
for a child,
because I have a lot of semen,

49:08.913 --> 49:10.348
but it doesn't...
- We know.

49:10.415 --> 49:11.816
- Retain much sperm.
- We know.

49:11.882 --> 49:14.019
- Wow. What's next?
- I just need you for a second.

49:14.052 --> 49:15.620
Thanks so much.
- Just--just--just give us--

49:15.686 --> 49:17.122
give us a second.
- Real quick.

49:17.188 --> 49:19.624
- What--wait.
What are you doing?

49:19.690 --> 49:22.827
- I'm going shopping.
- No.

49:22.893 --> 49:25.263
- Hi.

49:25.330 --> 49:26.797
Sorry to interrupt.

49:26.864 --> 49:29.800
We're your neighbors
from next door.

49:29.867 --> 49:32.370
And this is my friend Neal.

49:32.437 --> 49:34.939
We met at Princeton,
where he was

49:35.040 --> 49:39.810
the valedictorian
and an incredible poet

49:39.877 --> 49:43.614
and perhaps has something
beautiful to share

49:43.681 --> 49:46.284
on the topic of retirement.

49:46.351 --> 49:47.485
- Yeah.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.164
So happy you're retiring.

49:59.230 --> 50:02.233
You know, I hope you find
a new passion.

50:02.300 --> 50:05.303
Painting. You know?

50:05.370 --> 50:07.472
Go to a rec center.

50:07.538 --> 50:08.673
Look at me.
Look at my hands.

50:08.739 --> 50:12.410
Look at my hands.

50:12.477 --> 50:14.412
Like a bird.

50:14.479 --> 50:15.880
- Ohh.

50:15.946 --> 50:18.683
Oh, my gosh, a massage?

50:18.749 --> 50:21.286
- Yes.
Yes, yes, I certainly will.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.720
Thank you.

50:22.787 --> 50:25.490
- Chuck brings his table
right to your bouse.

50:25.556 --> 50:26.924
- Really?
He'll bring it to my house?

50:26.991 --> 50:28.359
- Yes.
- That's so nice.

50:28.426 --> 50:30.361
- Chuck just goes up and down.

50:30.428 --> 50:31.529
You'll feel relaxed.

50:31.596 --> 50:33.498
You'll escape your reality.

50:33.564 --> 50:35.133
- Oh, my--and how
do you know Chuck?

50:35.200 --> 50:38.269
- I'm Chuck.

50:38.336 --> 50:39.437
Right?
- Oh, my gosh.

50:39.504 --> 50:41.172
- Yeah.
That's my masseuse name.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.573
- Thank you, Kyle.
- You're welcome.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.209
- Thank you very much.

50:44.275 --> 50:45.443
- I'd be happy
to give you a massage

50:45.510 --> 50:46.977
if you want a massage.

50:49.114 --> 50:50.948
- Happy birthday.

50:51.015 --> 50:53.251
- Oh, Eliza. Really?
- Thank you.

50:53.318 --> 50:54.785
- I did feel like I had to.

50:54.852 --> 50:56.087
- This paper's so pretty.
Thank you.

50:56.154 --> 50:58.556
- I know you the like
the color, so...

50:58.623 --> 51:00.358
- You didn't have to
get me anything.

51:00.425 --> 51:02.160
This is--

51:02.227 --> 51:04.262
- Oh, tea kettle.
- Oh, my gosh, a tea kettle.

51:04.329 --> 51:07.398
Eliza!

51:07.465 --> 51:08.866
- That's perfect for you.

51:08.933 --> 51:11.602
- That is very thoughtful,
Eliza.

51:11.669 --> 51:12.903
Thank you.

51:12.970 --> 51:14.872
- Yep, I thought it out,
and I realized

51:14.939 --> 51:16.174
that's what you need most,
right?

51:16.241 --> 51:17.575
- Yeah.
You did not have to

51:17.642 --> 51:19.844
get me a thing, truly.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.812
- Ding-dong. Final gift.
Best for last.

51:21.879 --> 51:23.714
Happy birthday, Margie.
- Oh.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.750
- Here you go.
- Oh!

51:25.816 --> 51:29.420
What a lovely pot, Mark.

51:29.487 --> 51:32.190
- Open it.

51:32.257 --> 51:34.159
- Okay.

51:34.225 --> 51:35.860
Uh-oh.
- It's coq au vin.

51:35.926 --> 51:36.927
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:36.994 --> 51:38.429
It's my recipe right there.

51:38.496 --> 51:40.030
- Pretty rude, actually,

51:40.165 --> 51:41.499
to bring dinner
to a dinner party.

51:41.566 --> 51:42.700
That's rude, Mark.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.034
- We talked so much about it.

51:44.169 --> 51:47.071
I just wanted to show
you my recipe, and--

51:47.172 --> 51:48.873
- It smells great.
- Wow.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.841
- Happy birthday.
- That is very thoughtful.

51:50.908 --> 51:53.944
- Absolutely.

51:54.011 --> 51:57.548
- You should eat it.

51:57.615 --> 51:59.217
- I certainly couldn't.

51:59.284 --> 52:00.651
No.

52:00.718 --> 52:02.820
- Give it a taste.

52:02.887 --> 52:06.324
- Dear...
- Hmm?

52:06.391 --> 52:08.025
- Please try it, Margie.

52:08.092 --> 52:09.860
It'll never be as good
as it is right now.

52:11.462 --> 52:13.331
- Hmm.

52:13.398 --> 52:15.200
I'll just--you know,
I'll just--

52:15.200 --> 52:18.303
I'll just try a little bit,
a little taste of it.

52:18.369 --> 52:19.470
- Yeah.

52:19.537 --> 52:21.206
- Margie,
you don't have to eat that.

52:21.206 --> 52:23.274
- I know.
Well, it's a gift,

52:23.341 --> 52:24.942
and I feel bad.

52:25.009 --> 52:28.213
I'll just take a single bite.
Okay.

52:28.246 --> 52:31.549
Mmm. Mmm.

52:37.355 --> 52:38.823
That is very nice.

52:38.889 --> 52:40.758
It is very nice, Mark.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.327
- Very nice, Mark.
- Oh, man.

52:42.393 --> 52:47.298
- So whose would you say
is better?

52:50.801 --> 52:54.305
Between Mark and Winston?
- Thank you.

52:54.372 --> 52:57.275
They are--they are
both excellent.

52:57.342 --> 53:00.345
Both excellent.
- God.

53:00.411 --> 53:01.612
Feel like 50 bucks.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.848
- Winston.

53:03.914 --> 53:05.450
Hey, this is silly, okay?

53:05.516 --> 53:07.785
This is silly. Why don't you
just try a bite, okay?

53:07.852 --> 53:09.019
You can have two great dishes.

53:09.086 --> 53:11.956
Come on. Just try it.
- Try it, Winnie.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.157
Give it a whirl.
- Try it.

53:13.258 --> 53:14.859
- Try a bite of what?
- The coq au vin.

53:14.925 --> 53:15.960
- Oh, I would love to.
- Okay.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.027
- It's my favorite dish.

53:17.094 --> 53:18.296
I'd love to try
some coq au vin.

53:18.363 --> 53:19.630
Okay, and where should
I point the fork?

53:19.697 --> 53:22.467
'Cause it's not into this
big dish of dog shit.

53:22.533 --> 53:25.035
This chicken has no evidence
of red wine's involvement

53:25.102 --> 53:26.837
at all,
so I can't even possibly

53:26.904 --> 53:28.639
imagine how that's coq au vin,
so someone please tell me,

53:28.706 --> 53:30.641
where's the coq au vin?
'Cause I'd love to try some.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.277
Oh, is it hiding under here?

53:32.310 --> 53:35.079
Is it hiding under this wet,
undercooked, rubbery chicken

53:35.145 --> 53:37.848
that's clearly overly
salted and under-peppered,

53:37.915 --> 53:39.317
by the way, Mark?

53:39.384 --> 53:41.286
It's not--it's not under there.

53:41.286 --> 53:42.787
So has anybody
seen any coq au vin?

53:42.853 --> 53:44.389
'Cause I'd love to try it.

53:44.455 --> 53:47.091
I don't see any evidence
of red wine in here.

53:47.157 --> 53:50.295
I don't see any evidence
of red wine in here.

53:50.328 --> 53:51.962
Let's just get down--
should we just get down

53:52.029 --> 53:53.764
to the depths of it?
Yeah, no,

53:53.831 --> 53:55.300
even at the bottom of the dish
I don't see an ounce

53:55.366 --> 53:56.734
of coq au vin,
so I'm sorry,

53:56.801 --> 53:58.336
it's not in there, all right?

53:58.403 --> 53:59.870
So I don't know what this game
is that you're playing, Mark.

53:59.937 --> 54:01.472
Oh, you just keep taking bites
calmly

54:01.539 --> 54:02.907
like none of this
is happening?

54:02.973 --> 54:05.310
Keep playing the game, Mark.

54:05.376 --> 54:10.315
I just want to apologize
for everything.

54:10.348 --> 54:12.082
Enjoy the party without me.

54:12.149 --> 54:14.051
And happy birthday, baby.
I love you.

54:14.118 --> 54:15.386
We'll talk about it at home.
- I don't want--

54:15.453 --> 54:17.322
- I'll go wait in the car!

54:17.322 --> 54:20.090
I'm not cut out for this!

54:20.157 --> 54:22.427
- Beat it.

54:57.795 --> 55:00.164
- Hi.
- Oh.

55:00.230 --> 55:02.567
Oh.

55:10.040 --> 55:14.111
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, you're good.

55:14.178 --> 55:16.013
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

55:16.080 --> 55:18.549
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

55:18.616 --> 55:20.150
Pardon me.

55:26.290 --> 55:28.225
- Mitchell and Edward.
- Yeah.

55:28.292 --> 55:30.528
- Those are the two that you
were a surrogate for, right?

55:30.595 --> 55:31.762
- Mm-hmm.

55:31.829 --> 55:33.197
- It may be important.

55:33.263 --> 55:35.633
- It's okay.

55:35.700 --> 55:41.238
There might be, like,
a breach of contract issue.

55:41.305 --> 55:44.942
They make surrogates sign this
thing that says that you're

55:45.009 --> 55:47.812
not gonna drink or smoke while
you're pregnant, obviously,

55:47.878 --> 55:49.414
and I wouldn't do that.

55:49.480 --> 55:51.416
But you're also
supposed to, like,

55:51.416 --> 55:53.150
take vitamins and go
on all these walks

55:53.217 --> 55:55.019
and go to bed
by a certain time.

55:55.085 --> 55:59.023
And I didn't always do that.

55:59.089 --> 56:03.461
So, like, you know,
if there's a problem,

56:03.528 --> 56:07.565
guess who they go after?

56:07.632 --> 56:09.967
- So--so there's a problem?

56:12.437 --> 56:14.138
- We should dance.

56:14.204 --> 56:15.139
- Oh.
- It's a party.

56:15.205 --> 56:16.140
Do it.
- I'm not--

56:16.206 --> 56:18.943
- Let's do it.

56:23.481 --> 56:24.449
You're a very good dancer.

56:24.515 --> 56:25.950
- Oh, thank you.

56:26.016 --> 56:28.553
Took fencing lessons, so some
of the same skills apply.

56:28.619 --> 56:29.920
- Oh, good,
so you can protect us?

56:29.987 --> 56:31.622
- Yeah. Well, if we get
attacked by a fencer,

56:31.689 --> 56:33.724
then yeah.
- Can you defend against this?

56:33.791 --> 56:35.860
- Oh, wow.

56:35.926 --> 56:36.994
- I'm so sorry.

56:37.061 --> 56:38.729
I thought you were
gonna block that.

56:38.796 --> 56:41.999
- Yeah. Well, that's not
part of the skill set.

56:42.066 --> 56:44.969
You know, if we get any closer,
they might start to talk.

56:45.035 --> 56:48.338
- I don't think they're
gonna be talking about us.

56:48.473 --> 56:50.475
- I said,
are you ready to rock?

56:50.475 --> 56:51.876
- Yeah, baby.
- Yes!

56:51.942 --> 56:54.311
- Yes!

56:54.378 --> 56:57.047
- It tickles.
It tickles.

56:57.114 --> 56:58.248
It tickles.

56:58.315 --> 56:59.650
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hey, look at me.

56:59.717 --> 57:02.820
Tom Selleck.

57:07.091 --> 57:09.494
- Yee-haw!

57:16.501 --> 57:18.636
- Okay.

57:18.703 --> 57:22.206
I'm so sorry.
I don't know who this guy is.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.809
I...

57:24.875 --> 57:27.878
Oh.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.080
- Do you...

57:30.147 --> 57:32.550
- Uh...

57:43.594 --> 57:46.363
- What?

57:54.404 --> 57:55.806
- Yeah?

57:57.575 --> 57:58.876
- Oh, my gosh.

58:06.116 --> 58:07.785
- Thank you.

58:07.852 --> 58:10.054
Yes.
- Oh, my God.

58:10.120 --> 58:12.189
- You ready?
- Yes. Ready.

58:14.859 --> 58:16.961
There you go.
- Thank you.

58:17.027 --> 58:19.096
- After you.
- Oh my gosh, so gentlemanly.

58:19.163 --> 58:21.231
- Thank you.

58:31.576 --> 58:35.145
Hi.

58:35.212 --> 58:37.948
- Uh, look, I just--I just
want you to know

58:38.015 --> 58:40.484
this isn't going anywhere.

58:40.585 --> 58:42.152
- Yeah, that's okay.

58:42.219 --> 58:45.590
- Look, I don't have
the bandwidth for anything

58:45.623 --> 58:48.392
emotional right now.

58:48.458 --> 58:49.727
- Fine with me.

58:49.794 --> 58:50.995
- I guess what
I really wanted to say is,

58:51.061 --> 58:55.866
just don't fall in love
with me.

58:55.933 --> 58:59.069
- Not a problem.
- Just let me finish.

58:59.136 --> 59:04.041
My wife, she cheated on me
with an octogenarian.

59:04.108 --> 59:05.710
- Oh.

59:05.776 --> 59:07.945
both: I'm sorry.

59:08.012 --> 59:10.414
- It's okay.
I mean, I'm coping.

59:10.480 --> 59:14.451
But maybe she's truly
happy with someone

59:14.518 --> 59:17.054
older and more feeble.

59:17.121 --> 59:19.256
Maybe that makes
her feel strong.

59:19.323 --> 59:26.396
But what I do know
is that I look ridiculous.

59:26.463 --> 59:28.733
- You want to put this on?

59:33.671 --> 59:35.205
- I got you something.

59:35.272 --> 59:37.708
- Oh?

59:39.276 --> 59:45.315
- It's just a few notions
about how I feel about us.

59:45.382 --> 59:46.283
I hope it's not too soon.

59:48.418 --> 59:49.887
- Steven.

59:49.954 --> 59:53.057
"Steven, I want you to know
that I'm sorry about making

59:53.123 --> 59:55.860
"such a fuss about your store
not attracting the right kind

59:55.926 --> 59:58.362
"of clientele for the area.

59:58.428 --> 1:00:01.799
"Frames & More has been
nothing but a great neighbor.

1:00:01.866 --> 1:00:05.535
"I wish you the very
best in your retirement.

1:00:05.602 --> 1:00:08.839
Truly yours, Jonas Jewelers."

1:00:08.906 --> 1:00:12.076
- I meant every word.
- Mm.

1:00:18.883 --> 1:00:23.754
- For when you replace
the tea kettle.

1:00:23.821 --> 1:00:26.691
- Yeah.

1:00:26.757 --> 1:00:30.594
- And therefore,
I deduced the diamonds

1:00:30.661 --> 1:00:33.530
must be in some crevice
of the countess's body,

1:00:33.597 --> 1:00:34.899
- Ridiculous!

1:00:34.965 --> 1:00:38.769
I have been searched.

1:00:38.836 --> 1:00:41.571
- Yes, but thoroughly?

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:44.574
I have brought in a specialist.

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:45.843
- Good evening, madame.

1:00:45.910 --> 1:00:47.411
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, sir.

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:48.412
- Hi.

1:00:50.547 --> 1:00:53.050
- We should go somewhere.

1:00:53.117 --> 1:00:57.521
- Yeah. You sure Kyle's
gonna be all right?

1:00:57.587 --> 1:00:59.623
- Yeah.
He's a grown man.

1:00:59.690 --> 1:01:02.659
You've read and reread that
dating profile many times,

1:01:02.727 --> 1:01:05.095
so if he missed something,
that's kind of a choice.

1:01:05.162 --> 1:01:06.731
- He met that girl
on a dating app?

1:01:06.764 --> 1:01:09.166
- Yeah.
- And you knew?

1:01:09.233 --> 1:01:12.402
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you stop him?

1:01:12.469 --> 1:01:14.739
- Why would I do that?
He didn't want me to do that.

1:01:14.739 --> 1:01:16.306
- Were you helping him?

1:01:16.373 --> 1:01:17.742
- Yeah, a little.

1:01:17.742 --> 1:01:19.409
- You might have put
the nail in the coffin

1:01:19.476 --> 1:01:20.577
of their marriage.

1:01:20.644 --> 1:01:21.779
- Well, the builder
of the coffin

1:01:21.846 --> 1:01:23.380
is not the killer
of the person.

1:01:23.447 --> 1:01:26.483
Coffin builder actually serves
a very essential service.

1:01:26.550 --> 1:01:29.920
- Yeah, but the coffin builder
is not the hero.

1:01:29.987 --> 1:01:32.156
Like, he's the weird guy
with the long face

1:01:32.222 --> 1:01:33.323
and the creepy music.

1:01:33.390 --> 1:01:36.626
Nobody ever says,
"Oh, thank goodness

1:01:36.761 --> 1:01:37.661
for the coffin builder."

1:01:37.762 --> 1:01:38.863
Nobody's looking
forward to that.

1:01:38.929 --> 1:01:40.297
- That's just a casting issue.

1:01:40.364 --> 1:01:42.666
Like, imagine Ryan Reynolds
in that role.

1:01:42.767 --> 1:01:43.768
- Mm-hmm.

1:01:43.801 --> 1:01:46.103
- That's cash money.

1:01:46.170 --> 1:01:49.639
- The stuff you do
has consequences.

1:01:53.410 --> 1:01:54.879
- The stuff?

1:01:54.945 --> 1:01:56.613
- Yeah, with Kyle.

1:01:56.680 --> 1:01:59.049
And you egged Margie
into trying the coq au vin

1:01:59.116 --> 1:02:00.184
in front of Winston.

1:02:00.250 --> 1:02:03.954
- Margie wanted the coq au vin.

1:02:04.021 --> 1:02:05.022
Did you see the look
on her face?

1:02:05.089 --> 1:02:06.323
She was waiting for permission.

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:08.826
- You stole a sweet,
old man's tea kettle.

1:02:08.893 --> 1:02:11.528
- What makes him sweet?

1:02:11.595 --> 1:02:12.629
'Cause he's old?

1:02:12.696 --> 1:02:13.798
Have you talked
to an old person?

1:02:13.864 --> 1:02:16.500
- Eliza.

1:02:16.566 --> 1:02:17.835
- Okay.

1:02:17.902 --> 1:02:20.805
I know that tone.

1:02:20.871 --> 1:02:22.907
And I know that look.

1:02:22.973 --> 1:02:25.209
- Where are you going?
- You're boring.

1:02:25.275 --> 1:02:27.711
- You're reckless.
- You're a bystander.

1:02:27.812 --> 1:02:29.113
- Well, you're an agitator.

1:02:29.179 --> 1:02:31.015
- I'm an alligator?

1:02:31.081 --> 1:02:32.149
That's a compliment.

1:02:32.216 --> 1:02:34.718
Alligator is a very
powerful animal.

1:02:38.255 --> 1:02:39.723
- Where are the diamonds?
- I don't know.

1:02:39.824 --> 1:02:41.591
You cand find them, can you?
- Oh, God, you're the queen.

1:02:41.658 --> 1:02:43.427
- I am the queen.
Tell me again.

1:02:43.493 --> 1:02:44.661
- You're not the queen.
I know the queen.

1:02:44.728 --> 1:02:45.863
She's old.

1:02:45.930 --> 1:02:46.997
- Do you want these diamonds
or not?

1:02:47.064 --> 1:02:48.365
- I've got to find
the diamonds.

1:02:48.432 --> 1:02:50.667
- Well, I don't want you
to find the diamonds.

1:02:50.734 --> 1:02:52.569
- Okay, but--
- You know what I'll give you?

1:02:52.636 --> 1:02:54.839
- What's that?
- I'll give you maybe a ruby.

1:02:54.872 --> 1:02:56.273
- Oh, no.
- Maybe a ruby.

1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:57.641
- Oh, no.
- That's all you fuckin'--

1:02:57.707 --> 1:02:59.643
that's all you fuckin' get.
- Oh, it's my job.

1:02:59.709 --> 1:03:01.211
I gotta do my job.
- Do your job then.

1:03:01.278 --> 1:03:02.546
It's not working.

1:03:02.612 --> 1:03:04.849
And that's why
it's not working.

1:03:04.882 --> 1:03:06.316
Good thing I don't know.

1:03:06.383 --> 1:03:08.485
Good thing I don't know.
Try harder.

1:03:08.552 --> 1:03:10.187
Try harder.
- Oh, please.

1:03:10.254 --> 1:03:11.521
- Nope. That's not it.

1:03:11.588 --> 1:03:12.957
Nope.
That's not it.

1:03:13.023 --> 1:03:14.391
Nope.
That's not it.

1:03:14.458 --> 1:03:15.926
Still not finding them.

1:03:15.993 --> 1:03:17.862
Still not finding them.

1:04:01.005 --> 1:04:03.908
- Hi.

1:04:03.974 --> 1:04:05.809
- Okay.

1:04:14.484 --> 1:04:16.353
- Oh, fuck.

1:04:18.788 --> 1:04:20.457
No. Fuck.

1:04:20.524 --> 1:04:22.326
Hey.
Buddy, can you get up?

1:04:22.392 --> 1:04:23.660
- Wake up.

1:04:23.727 --> 1:04:27.397
Seriously, can you please
just get the fuck out?

1:04:28.933 --> 1:04:30.167
- Hey, dude,
I really need you to go.

1:04:30.234 --> 1:04:31.535
I work from home.

1:04:31.601 --> 1:04:33.837
I'm about to get on
a video conference, so...

1:04:33.938 --> 1:04:36.273
- I'm up.

1:04:36.340 --> 1:04:37.741
- Okay, guy, come on.

1:04:37.807 --> 1:04:40.377
You gotta go.
Let's go.

1:04:42.546 --> 1:04:45.449
- Okay.
Never mind.

1:04:45.515 --> 1:04:47.151
You just stay here.

1:04:47.217 --> 1:04:49.686
Please don't move.

1:04:54.091 --> 1:04:56.760
- Uh...

1:04:56.826 --> 1:04:58.128
Wow.
What a night.

1:04:58.195 --> 1:05:00.330
I woke up with pictures
of people in my phone

1:05:00.397 --> 1:05:02.599
that I don't even know.

1:05:02.666 --> 1:05:04.434
And it's not even
an iPhone anymore.

1:05:04.501 --> 1:05:07.037
- Thank you all for coming
to my birthday celebration.

1:05:07.104 --> 1:05:10.840
Winston is out at
the grocery store shopping.

1:05:10.975 --> 1:05:12.576
- I am not.

1:05:12.642 --> 1:05:14.278
I'm specifically not there.

1:05:16.046 --> 1:05:17.614
- Please go
to the grocery store.

1:05:17.681 --> 1:05:19.616
- So, Kyle, how was she?

1:05:19.683 --> 1:05:21.818
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

1:05:21.885 --> 1:05:23.687
- Well, you two seemed
to be hitting it off.

1:05:23.753 --> 1:05:25.855
- You know, somewhat.

1:05:25.990 --> 1:05:27.191
- Come on, dude.
Spill.

1:05:27.257 --> 1:05:29.659
- Look,
this isn't a locker room.

1:05:29.726 --> 1:05:31.728
I'm not here to tell you
who grabbed who,

1:05:31.795 --> 1:05:34.198
how long it was grabbed,
or what historical character

1:05:34.264 --> 1:05:35.699
did the grabbing.

1:05:35.765 --> 1:05:37.667
No, they're called
private parts for a reason.

1:05:37.734 --> 1:05:38.868
Done with conversation.

1:05:39.003 --> 1:05:40.704
- Okay.

1:05:40.770 --> 1:05:44.108
- Uh, you get home okay, Eliza?

1:05:44.174 --> 1:05:45.175
- I did.

1:05:45.242 --> 1:05:46.876
- I'm gonna throw up.

1:05:47.011 --> 1:05:49.013
- Whoa.

1:05:55.619 --> 1:05:56.886
- Wow.

1:06:00.024 --> 1:06:02.526
Oh,
I'm never gonna drink again.

1:07:13.297 --> 1:07:14.431
- Thank you.

1:07:14.498 --> 1:07:15.899
- It's for the cat.

1:07:15.965 --> 1:07:17.467
It's not for you.

1:07:17.534 --> 1:07:18.935
It's for the cat.

1:07:19.002 --> 1:07:20.870
The cat still loves you.

1:07:20.937 --> 1:07:22.005
- I know the difference.

1:07:22.106 --> 1:07:24.108
I wouldn't eat
out of a cat bowl.

1:07:24.108 --> 1:07:26.276
I was saying it to be nice.

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:38.955
- I miss the army.

1:07:40.857 --> 1:07:42.692
- No, electricity is optional.

1:07:42.759 --> 1:07:44.728
- No,
electricity is not optional.

1:07:44.794 --> 1:07:46.296
- Have you heard
of cave people?

1:07:46.363 --> 1:07:47.431
- Oh, my God.

1:07:47.497 --> 1:07:50.200
Okay, just, like,
act professionally

1:07:50.267 --> 1:07:53.237
and you'll have electricity
and a job, like a normal adult.

1:07:57.841 --> 1:07:59.609
- Did Mom tell you to say that?

1:07:59.676 --> 1:08:00.810
Did she?

1:08:00.877 --> 1:08:02.011
Dad?
- No.

1:08:02.146 --> 1:08:03.580
- Was it Dad?
- Might have been Dad.

1:08:03.647 --> 1:08:05.749
- Who literally gave you money
to make sure I never forget

1:08:05.815 --> 1:08:06.816
that I'm the fuckup?

1:08:06.883 --> 1:08:07.817
- Liza.

1:08:07.884 --> 1:08:09.153
- Hmm?

1:08:09.219 --> 1:08:11.054
- Look, I believe
in reprogramming our brains.

1:08:11.155 --> 1:08:12.822
What?
I do it for myself.

1:08:12.889 --> 1:08:15.492
You take a decision you've made
that was impulsive and, like,

1:08:15.559 --> 1:08:18.928
not at all good, and you, like,
imagine being in that moment

1:08:18.995 --> 1:08:20.330
and making
a different decision.

1:08:20.397 --> 1:08:22.566
Follow it through
to a better outcome.

1:08:22.632 --> 1:08:23.933
Hold this in your hand.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.235
Close your eyes.

1:08:25.302 --> 1:08:26.803
It'll create a sense
memory and help

1:08:26.870 --> 1:08:29.339
activate the new brain pathways
that we're about to build.

1:08:29.406 --> 1:08:32.176
Let's go to an early
memory, a bad decision,

1:08:32.209 --> 1:08:34.811
when these pathways
were first formed.

1:08:34.878 --> 1:08:36.613
- I can't think of anything.

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:38.448
- When you mailed in
a resignation letter for Dad.

1:08:38.515 --> 1:08:40.384
- Why does no one in our
family let me forget that?

1:08:40.450 --> 1:08:42.719
- When you almost drowned
trying to save a penguin.

1:08:42.786 --> 1:08:43.887
- Oh, that one.
- When you--

1:08:43.953 --> 1:08:45.255
- Do the penguin.
Do the penguin one.

1:08:45.322 --> 1:08:46.856
- Okay.

1:08:46.923 --> 1:08:48.758
You were six, right?
- Yeah.

1:08:48.825 --> 1:08:51.528
- Imagine you're there again,
okay, as a six-year-old.

1:08:51.595 --> 1:08:55.599
What do you see?
- I see her looking at me.

1:08:55.665 --> 1:08:57.967
- Where are you?
- I'm climbing the railing.

1:08:58.034 --> 1:08:59.469
- Is that a good idea?

1:08:59.536 --> 1:09:02.606
- Yeah, 'cause I'm little,
and I need to see better.

1:09:02.672 --> 1:09:04.541
- Okay, then what happens?

1:09:04.608 --> 1:09:07.744
- She tilts her head,
and I tilt my head,

1:09:07.811 --> 1:09:09.446
and we're, like, communicating.

1:09:09.513 --> 1:09:10.947
- Are you really,
or did you both just

1:09:11.014 --> 1:09:12.249
tilt your heads, Liza?

1:09:12.316 --> 1:09:14.518
Because tilted heads
doesn't mean anything.

1:09:14.584 --> 1:09:16.119
- I feel you don't get
how penguins think.

1:09:16.220 --> 1:09:17.987
- Okay, Liza, stop fighting it.

1:09:18.054 --> 1:09:19.856
Close your eyes.

1:09:19.923 --> 1:09:21.225
Then what happens?

1:09:21.225 --> 1:09:24.628
- She looks up
and takes a step and slips.

1:09:24.694 --> 1:09:26.330
- And then what happens?

1:09:26.396 --> 1:09:28.398
- And she falls in the water,
and I think she's drowning.

1:09:28.465 --> 1:09:29.499
- And then?

1:09:29.566 --> 1:09:31.335
- And then
I jump in after her,

1:09:31.401 --> 1:09:33.069
'cause I have to save her.
- Okay.

1:09:33.136 --> 1:09:34.504
Wait, wait, wait.
Now back up.

1:09:34.571 --> 1:09:36.606
You're there.
You see the penguin fall in.

1:09:36.673 --> 1:09:39.609
Now, Liza, instead of
jumping in, stop and think.

1:09:39.676 --> 1:09:41.878
- No, there's no time.
- Okay, you stop and think.

1:09:41.945 --> 1:09:44.614
You think, "The penguin
can swim, and I can't swim.

1:09:44.681 --> 1:09:45.982
The penguin will be okay."
- No.

1:09:46.049 --> 1:09:47.384
- "Yeah.
And I might not."

1:09:47.451 --> 1:09:48.518
You think...
- But--

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:49.986
- "No. No.
The best course of action

1:09:50.053 --> 1:09:52.256
is not to follow my instincts."
- But the penguin--

1:09:52.322 --> 1:09:54.591
- No. Fuck the penguin.

1:09:54.658 --> 1:09:56.593
- Fuck the penguin.

1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:58.362
- Fuck the penguin.

1:10:00.264 --> 1:10:03.800
- Fuck the penguin.

1:10:19.749 --> 1:10:22.519
Hello?

1:10:22.586 --> 1:10:24.788
Hey.

1:10:51.915 --> 1:10:54.451
- Eliza, you are right on time.

1:10:54.518 --> 1:10:56.653
You look rested.

1:11:07.230 --> 1:11:09.566
- Wow.
- Shh!

1:11:09.633 --> 1:11:13.803
- Hey.
No negative energy.

1:11:15.138 --> 1:11:18.342
- So we both wanted
you to hear this.

1:11:18.408 --> 1:11:20.977
We wanted to see you...

1:11:21.044 --> 1:11:23.347
.

1:11:27.150 --> 1:11:29.185
- Also...

1:11:29.252 --> 1:11:30.420
.

1:11:38.027 --> 1:11:39.228
- I can't hear you.

1:11:57.914 --> 1:11:59.716
- We just wanted to
make sure...

1:11:59.783 --> 1:12:02.952
.

1:12:07.290 --> 1:12:08.625
- This is for me?

1:12:14.030 --> 1:12:16.165
- Oh. Hello.

1:12:16.232 --> 1:12:18.702
Look whose beautiful eyes
are open.

1:12:18.768 --> 1:12:22.739
- Oh, are they open?
- They're open.

1:12:22.806 --> 1:12:23.907
- Let me see.

1:12:23.973 --> 1:12:25.141
- Come here and see
those beautiful--

1:12:25.208 --> 1:12:26.242
- Oh, they're--too late,
closed.

1:12:26.309 --> 1:12:27.611
- I haven't seen her eyes yet.

1:12:27.677 --> 1:12:29.679
She falls asleep immediately.

1:12:29.746 --> 1:12:31.615
- You know what they look like.
We should let her sleep.

1:12:31.681 --> 1:12:33.082
- No, no, no, no.
We're gonna stay on a schedule.

1:12:33.149 --> 1:12:34.183
We said we would.

1:12:34.250 --> 1:12:35.819
We just wanted to thank you.

1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:38.488
- For what?

1:12:38.555 --> 1:12:42.426
- Wh...for everything
I just said.

1:12:42.459 --> 1:12:43.927
For making us a family.

1:12:43.993 --> 1:12:45.529
- I honestly never thought
we'd get here.

1:12:45.595 --> 1:12:47.230
- Yeah.
- Really?

1:12:47.296 --> 1:12:50.600
- Mm-hmm.

1:12:50.667 --> 1:12:52.502
Ohh.

1:12:52.569 --> 1:12:53.637
It's her birthday.

1:12:53.703 --> 1:12:55.739
- We each have one.

1:12:58.775 --> 1:13:01.344
I wasn't expecting a gift.

1:13:01.445 --> 1:13:03.279
- Well,
what were you expecting?

1:13:03.346 --> 1:13:05.181
- It's just, at the end,
I wasn't

1:13:05.248 --> 1:13:07.751
really doing a lot
of walking, and I couldn't

1:13:07.817 --> 1:13:09.953
keep my vitamins down.

1:13:10.019 --> 1:13:12.622
And I did a lot of things
on the do-not-do list.

1:13:12.689 --> 1:13:17.260
Actually, I had McDonald's.

1:13:17.326 --> 1:13:18.895
All the time.

1:13:18.962 --> 1:13:21.531
I thought the baby might come
out looking like a hamburger.

1:13:23.500 --> 1:13:25.569
I did have a few sips of wine.

1:13:25.635 --> 1:13:26.736
- Oh, well.

1:13:26.803 --> 1:13:28.472
- A little bit.
- Yeah, sips.

1:13:28.472 --> 1:13:30.707
- I had a lot of sips of wine.

1:13:30.774 --> 1:13:32.842
- Okay, stop.

1:13:32.909 --> 1:13:34.177
It's okay.
- And when you sent me

1:13:34.243 --> 1:13:37.914
to that wellness spa,

1:13:37.981 --> 1:13:39.916
I actually just went to Vegas.

1:13:39.983 --> 1:13:42.151
It was really hard at the end.
- Well...

1:13:42.218 --> 1:13:49.025
- You know, I hated
being pregnant, and I...

1:13:49.092 --> 1:13:52.328
I acted out,
and I'm really sorry.

1:13:52.395 --> 1:13:53.830
- Hmm.

1:13:55.932 --> 1:13:58.735
- Hey, if we were to do this
all over again,

1:13:58.802 --> 1:14:00.937
whatever you did,
I would want you to do it

1:14:01.004 --> 1:14:04.240
precisely the same way,
because she is perfect.

1:14:04.307 --> 1:14:06.910
- Really?

1:14:06.976 --> 1:14:08.111
- She is.

1:14:09.913 --> 1:14:15.018
Eliza,
meet Jennifer Eliza Michaels.

1:14:15.084 --> 1:14:16.520
- What?

1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:17.687
- Yeah.

1:14:24.260 --> 1:14:25.929
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:14:25.995 --> 1:14:28.097
I...

1:14:53.723 --> 1:14:55.559
Okay.

1:15:15.779 --> 1:15:17.847
What is this?

1:15:17.914 --> 1:15:20.584
There is just
so much wrong here.

1:15:20.617 --> 1:15:23.286
And then you do this.

1:15:23.352 --> 1:15:26.489
- After we part,
I wanted you to remember

1:15:26.590 --> 1:15:29.125
that we weren't always awful.

1:15:35.364 --> 1:15:37.801
- Winston, can you be
a dear and get me some more

1:15:37.867 --> 1:15:39.435
chamomile tea, please?

1:15:41.638 --> 1:15:43.172
Winston.

1:15:43.239 --> 1:15:44.473
Dear.

1:15:44.608 --> 1:15:45.975
The chamomile?

1:15:46.042 --> 1:15:49.278
Whatever point
you're trying to make...

1:15:49.979 --> 1:15:52.481
Excuse me.

1:15:58.054 --> 1:16:01.725
- Hey, what's that white
on Margie's screen?

1:16:01.791 --> 1:16:04.227
- What are you talking about?

1:16:04.293 --> 1:16:05.662
- Is that smoke?

1:16:05.729 --> 1:16:07.864
- Oh, maybe that's just
steam from the kettle?

1:16:07.931 --> 1:16:09.532
- That's some
awfully dark steam.

1:16:10.700 --> 1:16:11.735
- Oh!
- Oh, no.

1:16:11.801 --> 1:16:13.637
- Oh, my God.
- Stay calm.

1:16:13.637 --> 1:16:14.938
It will probably
shut itself off.

1:16:15.004 --> 1:16:17.540
These things are made
to turn themselves off.

1:16:19.342 --> 1:16:20.944
- Shit.
- Margie?

1:16:21.010 --> 1:16:23.512
Hey.
Margie!

1:16:23.647 --> 1:16:24.748
- Stop yelling.

1:16:24.814 --> 1:16:26.215
They can't hear us.
Call the house.

1:16:26.282 --> 1:16:28.484
- Right. Right.
She's not in my contacts.

1:16:28.551 --> 1:16:30.954
- You don't have her number?
- We all just log on.

1:16:31.020 --> 1:16:32.722
I mean, does anybody have it?

1:16:32.789 --> 1:16:35.224
- The only number
we need is 911.

1:16:35.291 --> 1:16:36.760
- 911.
- Hi.

1:16:36.826 --> 1:16:38.094
Yes, there's a fire.

1:16:38.161 --> 1:16:39.863
It's not at my house.
It's at my coworker's,

1:16:39.929 --> 1:16:42.666
and I see her
on our video conference.

1:16:42.666 --> 1:16:44.868
- Ma'am, ma'am, do you
have an address for me?

1:16:44.934 --> 1:16:46.002
- Her address.

1:16:46.069 --> 1:16:48.004
What--does anyone
have her address?

1:16:49.105 --> 1:16:51.307
No--nobody?
- I don't know it.

1:16:51.374 --> 1:16:53.076
- You should be writing
these things down!

1:16:53.142 --> 1:16:55.444
- I'll start doing that!
- What's her last name?

1:16:55.511 --> 1:16:58.514
- What's her last name?

1:16:58.581 --> 1:17:00.717
Really?

1:17:00.784 --> 1:17:02.118
- Relk.
- Roark?

1:17:02.185 --> 1:17:03.386
Rock.
- Relk.

1:17:03.452 --> 1:17:05.689
- Revel.
- Reep?

1:17:05.755 --> 1:17:07.090
Ripe?
- Revolver.

1:17:07.156 --> 1:17:08.491
- We just going in Google
and typing in R

1:17:08.557 --> 1:17:09.959
and seeing what comes up
afterward?

1:17:10.026 --> 1:17:11.394
- Ma'am,
we're gonna need a name.

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:12.528
- Okay, they're gonna need an
address or a name.

1:17:12.595 --> 1:17:13.997
She's kind of being
a dick about it.

1:17:14.063 --> 1:17:16.733
- I'm calling HR.

1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:20.203
One.

1:17:20.269 --> 1:17:21.404
Two.
- I don't know.

1:17:21.470 --> 1:17:23.707
I think it's by
a Starbucks, maybe.

1:17:23.740 --> 1:17:25.574
They have the cups a lot.

1:17:25.709 --> 1:17:27.110
- Repeat options.

1:17:27.176 --> 1:17:29.312
- Or maybe she just had
lots of Starbucks cups

1:17:29.378 --> 1:17:32.148
that she, like, saves.
You know how people do that?

1:17:32.215 --> 1:17:33.850
She could be hoarding the cups.

1:17:33.917 --> 1:17:35.284
- Representative.

1:17:35.351 --> 1:17:37.553
- Look, how many Margie
and Winstons can there be?

1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:39.422
- Tell them they were
thinking of adding a pool.

1:17:39.488 --> 1:17:42.625
So look for a backyard that's
big enough to have a pool.

1:17:42.726 --> 1:17:43.893
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:45.128
It's starting to go out
on its own.

1:17:46.595 --> 1:17:48.297
- Don't. Don't.
- Whoa. Whoa.

1:17:48.364 --> 1:17:49.999
- Don't. Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't, don't!

1:17:50.066 --> 1:17:52.268
- Oh!

1:17:52.335 --> 1:17:53.903
- They could get trapped
in there

1:17:53.970 --> 1:17:56.272
and totally die from the smoke.

1:17:56.339 --> 1:17:59.042
No one's gonna
tell me I'm wrong?

1:17:59.108 --> 1:18:00.143
Okay, I gotta go over there.

1:18:00.209 --> 1:18:01.244
- What? Where?

1:18:01.310 --> 1:18:02.645
- I don't know where.

1:18:02.746 --> 1:18:04.513
- You're just gonna
look everywhere?

1:18:04.580 --> 1:18:07.050
- It's stupid to just run
around the neighborhood.

1:18:07.116 --> 1:18:09.418
Make a grid.
Search it methodically.

1:18:09.485 --> 1:18:11.420
Even then, you're probably not
gonna find the girl's body.

1:18:11.487 --> 1:18:13.089
- Okay, someone from HR
will get back to me.

1:18:13.156 --> 1:18:14.123
Just stay put.

1:18:14.190 --> 1:18:15.524
- I can't just do nothing.

1:18:15.591 --> 1:18:16.993
- What do you think
you can really do?

1:18:17.060 --> 1:18:18.762
- Eliza, you cannot go.

1:18:18.795 --> 1:18:19.963
You are not a fireman.

1:18:20.029 --> 1:18:22.598
It will be a liability
to the company.

1:18:22.665 --> 1:18:28.104
No, Eliza, you go,
and that's strike three.

1:18:34.878 --> 1:18:37.313
Eliza!

1:19:18.121 --> 1:19:22.191
- Come on.

1:19:22.258 --> 1:19:25.895
- Oh, what the hell?

1:19:34.137 --> 1:19:35.404
- Oh!
- Fire truck! Fire truck!

1:19:35.471 --> 1:19:36.405
- Fire truck! Fire truck!
- Fire truck! Fire truck!

1:19:36.472 --> 1:19:37.606
- Fire truck!
- Yeah!

1:19:37.673 --> 1:19:40.209
Signal. Signal. Signal. Signal.

1:19:40.276 --> 1:19:42.378
Okay.
- I can't believe this.

1:19:47.016 --> 1:19:48.451
- You're okay.

1:19:48.517 --> 1:19:50.719
Hey, we were so worried.
- Oh, my gosh.

1:19:50.854 --> 1:19:53.857
- Looks like the fire's
contained to the office.

1:19:53.857 --> 1:19:56.192
- My curtains. I...

1:19:56.259 --> 1:19:58.027
- We'll steal
the neighbor's curtains.

1:19:58.094 --> 1:19:59.328
- Okay.

1:19:59.395 --> 1:20:01.865
- What on Earth
could have caused this?

1:20:01.865 --> 1:20:02.999
- We'll never know.

1:20:03.066 --> 1:20:05.301
- Hey, guys,
HR just got back to me.

1:20:05.368 --> 1:20:08.637
You would not believe how close
we all live to each other.

1:20:08.704 --> 1:20:10.006
- Sir.
- Oh, shit.

1:20:10.073 --> 1:20:11.307
A real fire.

1:20:11.374 --> 1:20:12.675
- I think I saw kitty litter.

1:20:12.741 --> 1:20:14.844
Should I go and look for a cat?

1:20:18.314 --> 1:20:20.884
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1:20:20.950 --> 1:20:22.451
Cursory glance couldn't hurt,
but the cat

1:20:22.518 --> 1:20:24.954
can die before a human
even stubs his toe.

1:20:25.021 --> 1:20:28.057
- Copy that.
- Yeah.

1:20:33.997 --> 1:20:36.565
- You're totally burning
your house, dude.

1:20:36.632 --> 1:20:39.936
You want to let it simmer
on a low heat.

1:20:40.003 --> 1:20:41.304
This is too much.

1:20:41.370 --> 1:20:42.838
- No, a house like this
you want to get,

1:20:42.906 --> 1:20:44.874
like, a nice char
the around the edges,

1:20:44.941 --> 1:20:46.910
just like that.

1:20:46.976 --> 1:20:49.145
Cocky hot piece of shit.

1:20:49.212 --> 1:20:53.349
- Appreciate that.

1:20:53.416 --> 1:20:55.184
- Hey, would you--

1:20:55.251 --> 1:21:00.423
would you ever consider
impregnating my wife?

1:21:00.990 --> 1:21:04.160
- Winston, sweetie,
Kyle was offering

1:21:04.227 --> 1:21:06.695
for us to stay at his house;
isn't that so nice?

1:21:06.762 --> 1:21:08.297
- No, we should not.
- Yeah.

1:21:08.364 --> 1:21:09.465
Yeah.
- Why would we do that?

1:21:09.532 --> 1:21:10.399
- Because--
- He's a crazy person.

1:21:10.466 --> 1:21:12.001
- Not clinically, no.

1:21:12.068 --> 1:21:13.169
So I mean, I said yes.

1:21:13.236 --> 1:21:14.470
Look how sad he is.
He's gonna do it.

1:21:14.537 --> 1:21:16.239
- He's a broken man.
- We're gonna do it.

1:21:16.305 --> 1:21:18.174
- Oh, my God. Actually,
you all can come over.

1:21:18.241 --> 1:21:20.543
You know, we can watch "Babe."
You know, it's been a while.

1:21:20.609 --> 1:21:22.545
- The original "Babe"
or the German "Babe"?

1:21:22.611 --> 1:21:23.846
- No, thank you.

1:21:23.947 --> 1:21:26.950
Do you know how
the fire got started?

1:21:27.016 --> 1:21:28.784
- Cheap electric kettle.

1:21:32.421 --> 1:21:34.290
Why is everyone looking at her?

1:21:34.357 --> 1:21:36.125
Oh, she didn't give you
that kettle, did she?

1:21:36.192 --> 1:21:37.293
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:38.427
- Yes.

1:21:38.494 --> 1:21:39.562
- Sorry.

1:21:43.432 --> 1:21:45.201
Sorry for being me.

1:21:45.268 --> 1:21:46.970
I'm gonna go.

1:21:46.970 --> 1:21:48.604
Thanks so much
for the opportunity.

1:21:48.671 --> 1:21:52.976
I no longer work at Wenner
Platforms, A division of

1:21:53.009 --> 1:21:55.311
Quintana Sistemas
de Información, anymore.

1:21:55.378 --> 1:21:57.813
You can think of that, and
it'll make you feel better.

1:21:57.880 --> 1:21:59.148
- Hey.

1:22:01.017 --> 1:22:03.752
You're not fired.

1:22:03.819 --> 1:22:05.321
- Yeah, okay, well,
three strikes, right?

1:22:05.388 --> 1:22:06.355
So...

1:22:06.422 --> 1:22:10.259
- You get 1,000.

1:22:10.326 --> 1:22:12.095
- Really?

1:22:12.161 --> 1:22:14.197
I get 1,000.

1:22:15.398 --> 1:22:17.000
- Yes.

1:22:29.778 --> 1:22:31.480
- Wait, is that...

1:23:01.577 --> 1:23:04.447
- Hey.
Let's go inside.

1:23:04.513 --> 1:23:07.416
Come on.

1:23:14.457 --> 1:23:16.859
- Okay.

1:23:16.925 --> 1:23:18.361
- Hey, Kyle,
you have any popcorn?

1:23:18.427 --> 1:23:20.296
- Oh, I don't know.

1:23:22.365 --> 1:23:24.333
Hmm.

1:23:27.370 --> 1:23:29.372
- That's some very
large popcorn.

1:23:29.438 --> 1:23:32.208
- Yeah, well,
it's all I could find, so...

1:23:32.275 --> 1:23:34.477
- Thanks for the ride
on your scooter.

1:23:34.543 --> 1:23:35.544
It was very impressive.

1:23:35.611 --> 1:23:36.679
- Well, you know,
it actually takes

1:23:36.745 --> 1:23:37.880
no skill to ride a scooter.

1:23:37.946 --> 1:23:41.684
Like, none whatsoever.

1:23:41.750 --> 1:23:44.120
- Sorry about the hairy ass
running across your screen

1:23:44.187 --> 1:23:45.788
the other day.

1:23:45.854 --> 1:23:48.424
Trying to make sure
that never happens again.

1:23:48.491 --> 1:23:50.226
You know, if this is, like,
weird for you

1:23:50.293 --> 1:23:52.295
and you don't want me
to be here, that's fine.

1:23:52.361 --> 1:23:53.896
You can just tell me, and,
I mean,

1:23:53.962 --> 1:23:56.332
I won't quit,
'cause I really need this,

1:23:56.399 --> 1:23:58.101
but I can, you know--

1:23:58.167 --> 1:24:02.205
- Wait, what, you think I don't
want you to work here anymore?

1:24:02.271 --> 1:24:04.573
- I don't know.

1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:09.312
- You know, my whole life, I've
had this voice on my shoulder

1:24:09.378 --> 1:24:11.114
telling me to make
sensible decisions,

1:24:11.147 --> 1:24:13.416
and, you know, it's loud.

1:24:13.482 --> 1:24:14.717
It hurts me ear.

1:24:14.783 --> 1:24:17.720
You know,
shoulder to ear is very short.

1:24:17.786 --> 1:24:21.023
And you, you're, like, the
woman that comes in and flicks

1:24:21.124 --> 1:24:23.392
my little shoulder man away.

1:24:23.459 --> 1:24:29.365
And I'm starting
to hear my own thoughts.

1:24:31.134 --> 1:24:33.136
And I can deal with
a hairy butt in your face,

1:24:33.136 --> 1:24:38.641
but I was just hoping
that it'd be mine.

1:24:42.878 --> 1:24:45.148
- Well, go on then.

1:24:45.181 --> 1:24:46.515
Kiss the girl.
- Okay.

1:24:46.582 --> 1:24:47.883
Okay.
No.

1:24:47.950 --> 1:24:50.486
My voice does not sound
like Boris Johnson.

1:24:50.553 --> 1:24:51.687
- It's not Boris Johnson.

1:24:51.754 --> 1:24:53.456
It's more of a humble
chimney sweep.

1:25:07.536 --> 1:25:10.839
- Okay.
I know I need one remote

1:25:10.906 --> 1:25:14.076
to start the other remote.

1:25:14.177 --> 1:25:16.179
Oh, dear, what did I do?

1:25:16.212 --> 1:25:17.880
- Maybe try Netflix.

1:25:17.946 --> 1:25:19.215
- Oh, no,
it was Ally's account.

1:25:19.282 --> 1:25:21.684
She logged out.
Scorched earth on that one.

1:25:21.750 --> 1:25:22.851
- Check Amazon.

1:25:22.918 --> 1:25:24.353
- Oh, what,
and make Bezos richer?

1:25:24.420 --> 1:25:26.455
No, he should pay me
to watch his crap.

1:25:26.522 --> 1:25:28.023
- Very thoughtful.
- Thank you, dear.

1:25:28.090 --> 1:25:29.192
- Egg?
- Oh, yeah.

1:25:29.225 --> 1:25:32.228
Put it in my pocket.

1:25:39.802 --> 1:25:41.904
- Egg?

1:25:41.970 --> 1:25:45.007
- Absolutely.

1:25:45.073 --> 1:25:48.777
- And now, "Babe."

1:25:48.844 --> 1:25:50.045
- Oh, okay. All right.

1:25:50.112 --> 1:25:52.215
- All right.

1:25:55.584 --> 1:25:58.454
- This is a tale about
an unprejudiced heart

1:25:58.521 --> 1:26:02.225
and how it changed
our valley forever.

1:26:02.291 --> 1:26:04.593
There was a time
not so long ago

1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:08.997
when pigs were afforded no
respect, except by other pigs.

1:26:09.064 --> 1:26:14.603
They lived their whole lives
in a cruel and sunless world.
