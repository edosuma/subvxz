Would there be someone who could help them

00:07.902 --> 00:09.091
with that kind of a thing?

00:09.091 --> 00:11.078
Ruth: There is one man
a very powerful wizard.

Want to find who wrote
this book and ask them

00:14.131 --> 00:15.265

It'll be our own secret mission.

03:52.509 --> 03:54.244
Then why are you here?

03:54.278 --> 03:55.377
Well, I thought about

03:55.412 --> 03:57.713
what you said last night
about being a survivor,

03:57.748 --> 04:00.883
and you're right. It's like I said,
love, you don't have to worry about me.

about your precious dagger.

what I'm here about.

Can you reattach it?

05:37.156 --> 05:41.894
Indeed. But the question is, why?

05:41.928 --> 05:44.496
I've got a date with Emma.

Should things go well and
she wants me to hold her,

Oh, I see blackmail
brings out the romantic in you.

stay in for the night.

07:44.237 --> 07:46.037
My sister put her wedding
on hold because of me.

07:46.072 --> 07:47.272
I don't want anyone else

You look stunning, Swan.

08:05.123 --> 08:06.957

I know.

08:08.126 --> 08:09.260
[Sighs]

08:09.294 --> 08:10.594
Now that I'm settling into this world,

08:10.628 --> 08:13.097
I finally thought it was
time to dress the part.

08:13.131 --> 08:14.965
[Chuckling] Wow, you really went all out.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.467
Uh, Emma...

08:18.937 --> 08:20.004
Is that...

08:20.038 --> 08:22.272
Mine? Yeah.

08:22.307 --> 08:26.943
The dark one kindly restored
what he once took from me.

08:26.977 --> 08:29.846
It seems he has indeed changed his ways.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.282
So, what do I call you
now... "captain hand"?

08:32.317 --> 08:34.318
- "Killian" will do.
- Okay, Killian.

08:34.352 --> 08:36.352
We should get out of here before David

08:36.386 --> 08:38.421
decides to give you his
overprotective-dad speech.

08:38.455 --> 08:39.989
Well, you can spare
yourself the trouble, mate.

08:40.024 --> 08:42.192
I assure you, your daughter
couldn't be in better hands.

08:42.226 --> 08:43.592
That's exactly what worries me,

08:43.626 --> 08:45.328
especially now that
you have two of them.

08:45.362 --> 08:46.529
I can take care of myself.

08:46.563 --> 08:49.398
- You sure you don't want me to drive?
- Goodbye.

08:51.802 --> 08:54.269
I wasn't too hard on him, was I?

08:54.304 --> 08:57.440
You should have seen me when
Kristoff started dating Anna.

08:57.474 --> 08:59.074

My name is Joan.

09:23.532 --> 09:25.133
I was hoping you could help me.

09:26.236 --> 09:28.370
Is there something wrong with your skin?

09:29.171 --> 09:30.638
Not that it looks like
anything's wrong with your skin.

09:30.673 --> 09:31.639
[Chuckles]

09:31.674 --> 09:32.807
You know, I have a cream...

09:32.842 --> 09:35.577
your name isn't Joan.

You see, uh, names are
my stock and trade, dearie,

09:39.948 --> 09:43.684
and yours is... Anna of Arendelle.

09:43.718 --> 09:46.520
No need to keep secrets from me.

09:46.554 --> 09:50.858
I know more about you... than you think.

09:50.893 --> 09:53.861
So [Chuckles] you know why I'm here?

09:53.896 --> 09:55.363
You want to know

09:55.397 --> 09:59.100
why your parents ventured
into this strange land.

09:59.134 --> 10:01.101
My sister thinks it was because of her,

10:01.135 --> 10:02.603
but I know she's wrong.

10:02.637 --> 10:04.070
Can you help me?

10:04.105 --> 10:06.072
As it happens,

10:06.107 --> 10:09.410
your parents paid me a
visit on their journey.

10:09.444 --> 10:11.712
It would seem when one needs answers,

10:11.746 --> 10:13.747
I'm the place to go.

10:13.782 --> 10:15.616
What answers did they seek?

10:15.650 --> 10:17.750
Well, I can't just tell you, dearie.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.752
You see, aside from names,

10:19.787 --> 10:23.423
I also have a penchant for making deals.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.259
A deal? Sure, I'll make a deal.

10:26.294 --> 10:28.428
I'll do whatever it
takes to help my sister.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.930
[Laughing] Whatever it takes?

10:29.964 --> 10:31.764
Oh, I love it when they say that.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.534
At the foot of the dark mountains

10:34.568 --> 10:37.537
lives a very old
man... prickly sort,

10:37.571 --> 10:39.605
probably eats children for breakfast.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.275
I want you to put this in his tea.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.744
What will it do to him?

10:44.778 --> 10:47.580
Sorry, dearie. That's
not part of our agreement.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.514
Oh, speaking of which...

10:51.084 --> 10:52.651
our contract.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.920
Sign here,

10:54.955 --> 10:57.823
and I shall tell you why
your parents came to see me.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.359
Do we have a deal?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.337
[Sighs]

11:20.613 --> 11:22.246
Can I help you?

11:22.281 --> 11:25.783
Yes... uh, maybe. I-I-I mean...

11:27.119 --> 11:29.920
Can I come in?

11:29.955 --> 11:33.257
I just put a kettle on the fire.

11:33.292 --> 11:35.426
Join me for tea and biscuits.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.267
Biscuits.

11:44.302 --> 11:45.936
You mean you don't eat children?

11:45.971 --> 11:48.772
[Chuckles]

11:48.807 --> 11:52.442
Is that what they're
saying about me these days?

11:52.477 --> 11:53.611
Yes.

11:53.645 --> 11:56.346
No! Well...

11:56.381 --> 11:59.516
Sorry.

11:59.550 --> 12:01.851
So, what brings you so deep into the woods

12:01.886 --> 12:05.722
to the home of an alleged
devourer of children?

12:05.756 --> 12:08.691
I'm on a quest to help my sister,

12:08.726 --> 12:11.628
but I seem to have gotten myself
a little bit turned around.

12:11.662 --> 12:13.563
Well, you're welcome to
stay as long as you wish.

12:13.597 --> 12:15.798
I assure you, the biscuits are delicious,

12:15.833 --> 12:18.401
and they are made with flour.

12:18.435 --> 12:19.769
[Chuckles]

12:22.239 --> 12:24.974
[Teakettle whistling]

[Indistinct conversations]

13:08.384 --> 13:10.185
Well, Swan, what do you think?

13:10.219 --> 13:12.520
I like that it's not granny's.

13:17.426 --> 13:19.727
I've only seen you go on one date,

13:19.761 --> 13:21.562
and that was with a flying monkey.

13:21.597 --> 13:23.598
Thought I had to top that.

13:23.632 --> 13:25.432
He set the bar pretty high.
He proposed that night.

13:25.467 --> 13:26.701
He also tried to kill you.

13:26.735 --> 13:28.235
Right. There's that.

13:31.106 --> 13:32.139
[Clears throat]

13:32.173 --> 13:33.808
Shall I order us some drinks?

13:33.842 --> 13:35.142
Not tonight.

13:35.176 --> 13:36.443
Why, love?

13:36.478 --> 13:38.112
You a bit worried you'll
find me even more irresistible

13:38.146 --> 13:40.547
- after a few libations?
- No.

13:40.582 --> 13:42.249
I want to stay sober tonight

13:42.283 --> 13:45.219
just in case the snow queen
decides to crash our date.

13:46.887 --> 13:48.054
You still think

13:48.089 --> 13:50.724
her being here has
something to do with you.

13:50.758 --> 13:51.925
I don't think it. I know it.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.760
There was a puddle
next to my car this afternoon.

13:53.794 --> 13:55.795
A puddle? What does that prove?

13:55.830 --> 13:58.231
Look, Swan.

13:58.265 --> 14:00.900
I didn't bring you here to
worry about the snow queen.

14:00.935 --> 14:03.436
I brought you here to show you a good time.

14:10.444 --> 14:13.112
Oh, bloody hell. What's
the sheriff doing here?

14:15.382 --> 14:16.882
[Exhales sharply]

14:18.218 --> 14:19.619
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

14:19.653 --> 14:21.216
- Oh!
- Oh, my God. Are you all right, mate?

14:21.308 --> 14:23.356
- Really? There you go.
- Take your glass there, mate.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.190
- [Grunts]
- [Breathing heavily]

14:25.224 --> 14:28.360
Apologize to the lady, mate.

14:28.394 --> 14:31.229
Killian, look, it's okay.

14:33.199 --> 14:34.933
You.

14:34.968 --> 14:36.635
You're the thief that took
off from the ice-cream shop.

14:41.040 --> 14:44.342
[Sighs] Nope.

14:44.377 --> 14:48.346
Not gonna do it. We are on a date.

14:48.381 --> 14:51.616
And I am not gonna let some
petty fairy-tale thief ruin it.

14:51.651 --> 14:53.117
And there's an ice
wall around the town...

14:53.152 --> 14:54.486
He can't get away.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.655
I'll find him, but he is
not gonna ruin this night.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.557
Killian?

14:59.591 --> 15:02.226
Hey. Look.

15:02.260 --> 15:04.095
It's okay. It was
just a glass of wine.

15:04.129 --> 15:05.163
Sorry, love.

15:05.197 --> 15:08.900
I, uh, don't know what got into me.

15:18.555 --> 15:21.089
<i>Henry: Eye of newt? Dragon scale?</i>

15:21.123 --> 15:23.357
<i>Adder's fork? Lizard's maw?</i>

15:24.224 --> 15:25.161
Careful, Henry,

15:25.571 --> 15:28.106
unless you want to spend
your teenage years as a toad.

15:28.140 --> 15:30.575
So, which one of these
is gonna unfreeze Marian?

15:32.544 --> 15:34.846
None of them.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.514
I don't think I have
anything powerful enough

15:36.548 --> 15:38.549
to counteract the snow queen's magic.

15:38.584 --> 15:40.184
Is it because Robin Hood still loves you?

15:42.087 --> 15:43.387
Who told you that?

15:43.422 --> 15:44.722
No one.

15:44.756 --> 15:46.890
But I know how this stuff works.

15:46.925 --> 15:49.260
I know that true love's
kiss didn't work on Marian

15:49.294 --> 15:50.728
<i>because he still loves you.</i>

15:50.762 --> 15:53.397
But isn't that a good thing?

15:53.432 --> 15:55.365
Shouldn't you be happy?

15:57.669 --> 16:00.971
In this case, Henry,

16:01.006 --> 16:02.640
I'm afraid this may be something

16:02.674 --> 16:05.676
you're just too young to understand.

16:11.382 --> 16:13.517
[Sighs]

16:13.551 --> 16:15.519
Well...

16:15.553 --> 16:18.021
Not bad.

16:18.055 --> 16:20.257
You actually managed to make me forget

16:20.291 --> 16:23.426
that Storybrooke was under
siege from an evil snow queen.

16:23.461 --> 16:24.761
I was worried

16:24.795 --> 16:26.796
that our run-in with that
thief might have cast a pall.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.364
I apologize for overreacting.

16:28.398 --> 16:29.398
Hey.

16:31.201 --> 16:34.003
It's okay.

16:34.038 --> 16:37.674
You want to come in and have coffee

16:37.708 --> 16:40.342
with my parents, a newborn,
and a human ice maker?

16:40.377 --> 16:41.610
[Both laugh]

16:41.645 --> 16:44.180
I really need my own place.

16:44.214 --> 16:45.847
I suppose we'll just
have to wait till next time.

16:45.882 --> 16:48.884
Next time? I don't remember asking.

16:48.918 --> 16:51.887
That's 'cause it's my turn.

16:51.921 --> 16:54.690
Will you go out with me again?

17:20.281 --> 17:23.284
Okay. [Sighs]

17:25.354 --> 17:27.154
Good night, Killian.

17:27.189 --> 17:30.391
Good night.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.128
[Door closes]

17:41.525 --> 17:42.399
<i>Mary: So, how was it?</i>

17:44.139 --> 17:45.485
You guys are still awake. [Chuckling]

17:45.485 --> 17:46.873
We want to hear everything about the date.

17:46.875 --> 17:47.908
Just for the record,

17:47.943 --> 17:50.410
some of us don't want to hear everything.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.778
How was the restaurant?
Did you go anywhere after?

17:51.812 --> 17:53.347
Was there a good-night
kiss? That, for instance,

17:53.381 --> 17:55.349
is one of the things I
don't want to know about.

17:55.383 --> 17:57.150
I really need to get my own place.

17:57.184 --> 17:58.852
Good night, guys. [Sighs]

17:58.886 --> 18:01.521
She seems happy.

18:01.556 --> 18:03.357
I guess he really has changed.

18:03.391 --> 18:05.859
I can hear you guys.

18:05.893 --> 18:07.894
[Insects chirping]

18:14.034 --> 18:18.171
Oh. We'll see about that, won't we?

18:18.205 --> 18:20.673
Hook: Bloody hell.

18:20.707 --> 18:22.742
That's what I say.

18:24.878 --> 18:27.647
- You.
- I've been a pirate long enough

18:27.681 --> 18:29.106
to know there's nothing
worth stealing in there.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.616
That's what you think.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.617
You're drunk, mate. Go home.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.786
- Get off me, man.
- [Grunts]

18:37.157 --> 18:38.624
What the hell, mate?

18:46.332 --> 18:49.168
You tell anyone about
this, you're a dead man.

18:59.578 --> 19:01.879
Bloody crocodile was right.

19:05.117 --> 19:08.219
So, you poured it in the tea?

19:08.253 --> 19:10.087
Just as you asked.

19:10.122 --> 19:12.190
- And he drank it?
- Every last drop.

19:12.224 --> 19:14.058
Good! Then he'll live!

19:14.092 --> 19:15.492
So, now can you tell me
why my parents came...

19:15.527 --> 19:18.696
wait, what?

19:18.730 --> 19:20.064
What do you mean, "live"?

19:20.098 --> 19:23.567
He'll live because he drank
the antidote you gave him.

19:23.601 --> 19:25.703
Antidote? To what?

19:25.737 --> 19:27.338
Uh, poison.

19:27.372 --> 19:29.406
I thought it was poison.

19:29.441 --> 19:32.209
[Laughs] No! The poison's
what he drank yesterday!

19:32.243 --> 19:35.546
What you had was the cure for that.

19:35.580 --> 19:37.247
I didn't give it to him.

19:37.281 --> 19:38.716
Well, why not?

19:39.584 --> 19:40.751
We had a deal.

19:40.785 --> 19:41.785
We need more antidote.

19:41.820 --> 19:42.953
We have to go back to the cottage.

19:42.987 --> 19:44.187
- We have to help him.
- Well...

19:44.222 --> 19:48.091
I'm afraid it's far too
late for that, dearie.

19:48.125 --> 19:51.261
<i>[Grunts]</i>

19:52.496 --> 19:54.831
<i>[Groans]</i>

19:57.969 --> 20:00.703
You should have listened to
me when you had the chance.

20:14.668 --> 20:16.301
He's got to be here somewhere.

20:16.336 --> 20:18.437
Careful you don't step on it!

20:18.471 --> 20:21.206
[Sighs] We have to find him.
You have to change him back.

20:21.241 --> 20:22.441
Oh, but I can't, dearie.

20:22.475 --> 20:23.642
Why?

20:23.676 --> 20:25.477
Because I don't want to.

20:25.512 --> 20:29.148
He was protecting something that I need.

20:29.182 --> 20:31.417
You were the one who poisoned him.

20:31.451 --> 20:31.958
[Giggles]

20:31.958 --> 20:33.790
[Sighs] Then why did you
send me there with an antidote

20:33.790 --> 20:35.651
if you wanted to turn him into a mouse?

20:35.651 --> 20:38.499
It was never about him.
It was always about you.

20:39.359 --> 20:40.992
It was all a test?

20:41.340 --> 20:43.874
And one you performed admirably.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.479
You see, he's but the
first line of defense.

20:47.513 --> 20:50.982
And what he protects is also
guarded by an enchantment...

20:51.016 --> 20:52.984
a spell that can only be broken

20:53.018 --> 20:55.987
by someone who has been
tempted by their inner darkness

20:56.021 --> 21:00.390
and turned away from it,
someone just like you.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.493
I knew you wouldn't do it.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.495
I knew you'd see the best in the old man.

21:04.529 --> 21:07.042
I never faced my inner darkness.

21:07.248 --> 21:09.144
- What?
- As soon as I met the old man,

21:09.144 --> 21:10.334
I knew what I had to do.

21:10.368 --> 21:12.536
I could never hurt
someone to get what I want.

21:12.570 --> 21:13.837
Elsa wouldn't want me to.

21:13.871 --> 21:15.506
So I was never even tempted

21:15.540 --> 21:19.075
by that inner darkness you speak of.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.744
In fact, I don't even think I have one.

21:20.778 --> 21:24.581
I'm, unlike you, nice.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.751
Well, then, dearie, I
hope you're gonna enjoy

21:27.785 --> 21:30.386
spending the rest of your
life locked up in my tower.

21:32.189 --> 21:33.657
It was part of our deal.

21:34.925 --> 21:37.827
But I have to get back to Elsa.

21:37.862 --> 21:41.230
Then you should never have
left home in the first place.

21:41.265 --> 21:43.733
Imagine the guilt she will feel

21:43.768 --> 21:46.235
when you don't return
home from your journey...

21:46.270 --> 21:48.604
a journey you only took because of her.

21:48.639 --> 21:52.041
She will finally become that monster

21:52.075 --> 21:53.876
everyone fears she is.

21:53.910 --> 21:55.077
[Gasps mockingly]

21:55.111 --> 21:57.980
I suppose the wedding's off.

21:59.983 --> 22:01.551
- No!
- [Gasps]

22:01.585 --> 22:02.584
Rip it up.

22:02.618 --> 22:04.352
Rip up the contract now!

22:04.387 --> 22:06.055
Well, I can't do that, dearie.

22:06.089 --> 22:09.958
No, I'm afraid the only way
for you to escape your fate

22:09.993 --> 22:12.928
is by killing... Me.

22:12.962 --> 22:15.230
And we both know...

22:15.264 --> 22:18.567
You're just... Too...

22:18.601 --> 22:19.934
Nice.

22:24.307 --> 22:27.676
Do it.

22:29.078 --> 22:30.745
Go on.

22:32.682 --> 22:35.083
Right through me.

22:35.117 --> 22:36.117
Do it.

22:37.252 --> 22:38.652
Do it.

22:38.687 --> 22:39.887
[Breathing heavily]

22:39.922 --> 22:41.422
Do it!

22:41.456 --> 22:42.423
Do it!

22:42.457 --> 22:43.891
- Do it!
- [Whimpers]

22:44.292 --> 22:45.860
[Sword clatters]

22:47.696 --> 22:51.932
You may never have considered
dosing the old man...

22:54.302 --> 22:58.472
but you just thought about killing me.

23:02.977 --> 23:04.578
[Giggles]

23:04.613 --> 23:08.581
And now I have
exactly what I need...

23:08.616 --> 23:12.585
the tear of someone who has
faced their inner darkness

23:12.620 --> 23:15.155
and turned away.

23:16.690 --> 23:20.460
The love for your sister was all I needed.

23:20.494 --> 23:23.130
I should have known.

23:23.164 --> 23:24.797
I should have known
the moment I met you...

23:24.831 --> 23:26.499
you're a monster.

23:26.533 --> 23:30.169
You take the most precious
thing in this world...

23:30.203 --> 23:32.672
Love...

23:32.706 --> 23:36.609
and turn it into a weapon.

23:36.644 --> 23:40.980
Love is a weapon, dearie.

23:41.014 --> 23:43.182
Always has been.

23:43.216 --> 23:44.516
It's just...

23:44.550 --> 23:47.352
[Whoosh]

23:47.387 --> 23:49.955
So few people know how to wield it.

23:49.990 --> 23:53.659
[Giggles]

24:04.437 --> 24:06.338
[Whoosh]

24:14.013 --> 24:16.848
[Warbling]

24:38.370 --> 24:40.404
[Keys jingle]

24:43.542 --> 24:45.676
- You were right.
- Get out.

24:45.711 --> 24:47.211
I don't want this infernal hand anymore.

24:47.245 --> 24:48.545
It's taken possession of me.

24:48.579 --> 24:50.881
You should have heeded my
warning when I offered it.

24:50.915 --> 24:52.883
I can't control it. Remove the damned thing

24:52.917 --> 24:55.418
before it makes me do
something you'll regret.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.354
- Was that a threat?
- Aye, mate.

24:57.388 --> 25:00.023
Take it back, or Belle
learns that the dagger she has

25:00.058 --> 25:01.591
is as fake as your new disposition.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.460
Oh, is it?

25:03.494 --> 25:06.363
- Is it what?
- Fake.

25:06.397 --> 25:08.965
Well, you wouldn't have given
me the hand if it weren't.

25:08.999 --> 25:11.300
After you extracted that price,

25:11.335 --> 25:13.903
I switched the real dagger back.

25:15.506 --> 25:16.473
No, you're lying.

25:16.507 --> 25:17.940
Am I?

25:17.975 --> 25:21.944
Seems you've lost
that leverage you once had.

25:23.747 --> 25:26.715
So if you want to part ways with that hand

25:26.750 --> 25:30.219
and get this back,

25:30.254 --> 25:32.421
there's only one way I'll help.

25:34.124 --> 25:36.925
Damn.

25:36.959 --> 25:38.594
What do you want?

25:38.628 --> 25:39.828
All in due time.

25:39.863 --> 25:40.929
And you think I'm daft enough

25:40.963 --> 25:42.931
to agree to that
without knowing the terms?

25:42.965 --> 25:45.768
I'll find another way to rid
myself of this damned hand.

25:45.802 --> 25:47.503
I'm afraid that's easier said than done.

25:47.537 --> 25:50.672
You see, my magic put that hand on,

25:50.707 --> 25:53.808
and only my magic can take it off.

25:57.213 --> 25:58.780
- [Grunts]
- Aah!

25:58.814 --> 25:59.948
[Breathing shakily]

26:01.550 --> 26:03.851
You'd think you'd have learned

26:03.886 --> 26:07.522
the first time you
buried that hook in me...

26:07.556 --> 26:11.358
it never sticks.

26:11.393 --> 26:14.261
That wasn't me.

26:14.296 --> 26:17.698
You're losing control, dearie.

26:17.733 --> 26:20.701
Next time, you might do something

26:20.736 --> 26:25.005
to someone who can't be so easily fixed.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.875
You have a deal. I'll
do whatever it takes.

26:28.910 --> 26:31.011
Oh, I do love it when they say that.

26:31.046 --> 26:34.848
Meet me at the docks
tomorrow morning, captain.

26:36.318 --> 26:39.553
We have work to do.

26:43.938 --> 26:44.956
<i>Man on the radio: That was "left
of the dial" by the replacements</i>

26:44.956 --> 26:46.702
<i>coming to you here on w-o-l-f 98,</i>

26:47.075 --> 26:48.863
<i>home of the original party animals.</i>

26:49.211 --> 26:51.045
<i>Current temps in the Storybrooke Metro area</i>

26:51.079 --> 26:54.882
<i>are 70s in midtown, dropping
to low 30s out by the ice wall.</i>

26:54.916 --> 26:56.851
<i>- Ain't it always something at the town line?</i>
- [Tires screech]

26:56.885 --> 26:58.985
<i>But don't sweat it, not that you can.</i>

26:59.019 --> 27:00.520
<i>- Wherever you are, chill out with us...
- [Breathing heavily]</i>

27:00.555 --> 27:02.556
<i>as we head into another five in a row,</i>

27:02.590 --> 27:04.725
<i>brought to you by granny's diner.</i>

27:04.759 --> 27:07.894
<i>Granny's diner... it's
better than you remember.</i>

27:07.928 --> 27:10.230
<i>All right, we've got a request
here from Mr. rip van winkle,</i>

27:10.265 --> 27:12.566
<i>who is looking for something
classic to wake up to.</i>

27:12.600 --> 27:14.756
<i>- Well, the doctor is in.</i>
- I knew it.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.814
Why the hell are you following me?!

27:21.600 --> 27:24.201
Hey! Stop!

27:37.582 --> 27:39.383
What the hell?

27:39.417 --> 27:41.385
[Cellphone ringing]

27:41.419 --> 27:42.445
[Beep]

27:42.629 --> 27:44.063
Now's not a great time.

27:44.098 --> 27:46.932
Emma, I need you to
come down to the library.

27:46.967 --> 27:49.301
We have a situation.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.259
Good morning, captain.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.263
Well...

28:18.297 --> 28:20.399
I trust you're ready.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.935
I'm ready to pay the price
and get this over with.

28:25.270 --> 28:26.270
Good.

28:27.773 --> 28:28.773
[Whoosh]

28:30.142 --> 28:32.443
What are we gonna do with that?

28:32.477 --> 28:34.779
This is gonna help me find an old friend.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.251
After you.

28:54.933 --> 28:55.933
[Whoosh]

28:59.370 --> 29:01.137
I helped you get what you want,

29:01.172 --> 29:03.506
so give me what you promised.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.876
Tell me about my parents.

29:05.910 --> 29:09.212
Well, dearie, the king
and queen of Arendelle

29:09.246 --> 29:13.116
landed on my doorstep
with an itsy-bitsy problem...

29:13.150 --> 29:15.651
your sister.

29:15.686 --> 29:19.355
They wanted something to
take away her powers...

29:19.390 --> 29:21.691
Forever.

29:21.725 --> 29:24.694
My parents loved Elsa.

29:24.728 --> 29:27.897
Sounded more to me like they feared her.

29:27.931 --> 29:31.033
It's a thin line and, oh, so easy to cross.

29:31.068 --> 29:34.369
You must have known.

29:34.404 --> 29:37.873
They always wished she had
been born a little bit more...

29:37.908 --> 29:39.208
Normal.

29:39.242 --> 29:42.812
Did they find what
they were looking for?

29:42.846 --> 29:44.679
I'm afraid not.

29:44.714 --> 29:47.048
<i>No one could lay their hands
on that kind of magic...</i>

29:47.083 --> 29:49.384
Until now.

29:49.419 --> 29:51.653
So, that's what the box does.

29:51.687 --> 29:54.323
Not the box, what's inside...

29:54.357 --> 29:56.425
a hat,

29:56.459 --> 30:01.763
crafted thousands of years ago
by a sorcerer for one purpose...

30:01.797 --> 30:04.933
to steal magical power...

30:04.967 --> 30:09.270
and guarded all these
years by his apprentice.

30:09.304 --> 30:12.741
What are you going to do with it?

30:12.775 --> 30:15.243
When the hat has collected
all its ill-gotten power

30:15.277 --> 30:20.414
and is fully charged,
I will be unstoppable.

30:20.449 --> 30:23.484
I thought the dark one
was already unstoppable.

30:23.519 --> 30:26.187
There are limits, however small.

30:26.221 --> 30:28.689
No. You can't.

30:28.723 --> 30:31.659
That mouse... that apprentice...

30:31.693 --> 30:33.527
he dedicated his life

30:33.561 --> 30:36.363
to keeping it out of the
hands of people like you.

30:36.397 --> 30:40.968
Too bad he's not here to stop me.

30:41.002 --> 30:44.772
What if he is?

30:50.010 --> 30:51.110
Aah!

30:52.180 --> 30:53.446
Aah!

30:54.649 --> 30:55.848
Don't come any closer!

30:57.851 --> 31:00.153
Wait...

31:00.188 --> 31:02.855
You're not coming any closer
just because I told you not to?

31:05.759 --> 31:08.061
I get it.

31:08.095 --> 31:12.065
As long as I have this wavy knife,

31:12.099 --> 31:15.001
you have to do as I say, don't you?

31:15.035 --> 31:17.170
Yes.

31:17.204 --> 31:18.938
That's how it works.

31:18.972 --> 31:21.307
Is that one of the limits you spoke of?

31:21.341 --> 31:23.275
Is that why you want the hat...

31:23.310 --> 31:26.612
to free yourself from
the control of this dagger?

31:26.646 --> 31:29.315
Answer me. To be free of the
control and to keep my power.

31:29.349 --> 31:30.616
Yes.

31:30.650 --> 31:33.285
Yeah, I can't let you
walk out of here with that.

31:33.320 --> 31:37.723
So, please, give me the box.

31:45.331 --> 31:47.298
Remember, dearie,

31:47.333 --> 31:50.969
you can't keep hold of that dagger forever,

31:51.003 --> 31:52.070
and you don't want to be

31:52.105 --> 31:55.340
on the other end of it when I get it back.

31:55.374 --> 32:01.546
Then I command you send me
and this box home to Arendelle.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.449
If I must.

32:04.483 --> 32:07.151
Wait. And, also, you can never hurt me.

32:07.185 --> 32:08.620
Or my sister.

32:08.654 --> 32:11.656
And you have to turn the
mouse back into a man.

32:13.491 --> 32:17.128
Okay.

32:17.162 --> 32:19.163
Now I'm ready.

32:20.832 --> 32:23.033
[Whoosh]

32:28.839 --> 32:31.007
[Screams]

32:37.515 --> 32:40.651
To whom is our
bristled guide leading us?

32:40.685 --> 32:43.487
Someone who wronged me long ago.

32:43.521 --> 32:47.556
And today, he's
going to pay the price.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.168
Hello, old friend.

32:59.303 --> 33:01.171
Captain, please see our host a seat.

33:06.410 --> 33:07.576
[Man grunts]

33:22.558 --> 33:24.893
[Warbling]

33:30.099 --> 33:32.935
[Whoosh]

33:35.771 --> 33:38.306
You have it.

33:38.341 --> 33:40.141
Don't tell me you doubted me.

33:40.175 --> 33:44.713
Every dark one tries. Every one fails.

33:44.747 --> 33:47.114
Might be time to update the motto.

33:47.149 --> 33:51.385
You may have the hat, but we both know

33:51.419 --> 33:54.121
you will never collect enough
power to do what you want.

33:54.156 --> 33:55.622
Oh, I will.

33:55.657 --> 34:01.329
But, alas, you won't
be there to see it.

34:05.433 --> 34:06.767
[Whoosh]

34:06.801 --> 34:07.968
No!

34:08.002 --> 34:09.436
[Groaning]

34:23.217 --> 34:25.252
Where the hell did he go?

34:25.286 --> 34:27.120
[Sighs]

34:27.154 --> 34:30.891
Exactly where I need him.

34:37.931 --> 34:39.712
[Grunts]

34:39.987 --> 34:41.788
Come on.

34:41.822 --> 34:43.090
Just one?

34:43.123 --> 34:44.123
[Grunts]

34:44.158 --> 34:45.192
[Scoffs]

34:45.226 --> 34:46.760
Sven, stop pouting.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.862
You love carrots. What is wrong with you?

34:49.896 --> 34:51.931
Think maybe he missed me?

34:54.268 --> 34:55.967
Hmm?

34:56.002 --> 34:57.136
[Chuckles]

34:57.170 --> 34:59.138
- [Neighs]
- [Sighs]

34:59.172 --> 35:00.640
Oh!

35:00.674 --> 35:03.008
Not nearly as much as I did.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.715
[Grunting]

35:09.750 --> 35:10.983
Not now, Sven.

35:11.017 --> 35:12.317
[Slurps]

35:12.352 --> 35:15.087
[Groans]

35:16.656 --> 35:17.686
What is it?

35:18.009 --> 35:19.877
I took a bath this morning, I swear.

35:19.911 --> 35:22.046
No. No, you smell wonderful.

35:23.448 --> 35:24.749
It's just...

35:25.851 --> 35:27.752
my mission didn't go as planned.

35:27.786 --> 35:30.821
So they did leave because of Elsa?

35:30.856 --> 35:33.590
They got on that ship
because they were afraid of her.

35:33.625 --> 35:35.159
They wanted to change her.

35:35.193 --> 35:37.927
They were looking for a way
to take away her powers...

35:37.962 --> 35:39.296
With this.

35:39.330 --> 35:40.631
That is...

35:40.665 --> 35:42.165
Horrible? Terrible?

35:42.199 --> 35:43.336
The worst news you've ever heard,

35:43.336 --> 35:45.168
and the world might as well end right now?

35:45.202 --> 35:46.976
I was gonna say "bad,"

35:47.173 --> 35:48.672
but, yeah, what... what you said.

35:48.706 --> 35:50.874
What are you gonna tell her?

35:52.443 --> 35:56.246
I...

35:56.280 --> 35:58.581
I don't know.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.950
[Sighs]

36:02.719 --> 36:05.688
Okay. We're done.

36:05.722 --> 36:07.924
I've fulfilled our deal. Now take it off.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.962
[Whoosh]

36:17.161 --> 36:20.436
Our deal actually isn't complete.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.104
I say it is.

36:22.138 --> 36:24.674
You can no longer control me, mate.

36:24.708 --> 36:26.008
I just saw you use the real dagger,

36:26.042 --> 36:27.776
so I know you're lying to Belle.

36:29.512 --> 36:32.681
You've got nothing on me.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.955
Security tape...

36:41.057 --> 36:43.024
from the house we just left.

36:44.059 --> 36:45.860
How do you think miss Swan is gonna react

36:45.894 --> 36:50.732
when she finds out what you
did to that kindly old man?

36:50.766 --> 36:55.470
I know how that device works.
And if I'm on there, so are you.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.840
[Whoosh]

36:58.874 --> 37:00.507
And now I'm not.

37:00.542 --> 37:02.076
But you are.

37:02.110 --> 37:05.079
I only did what you asked

37:05.113 --> 37:07.514
so I could rid myself of that cursed hand

37:07.549 --> 37:09.217
so I could become a better man.

37:09.251 --> 37:10.718
Emma will understand that.

37:10.752 --> 37:12.519
Even when she finds out the truth?

37:12.554 --> 37:13.888
What truth?

37:13.922 --> 37:18.024
This hand isn't cursed.

37:20.061 --> 37:21.194
No, you said...

37:21.229 --> 37:23.530
[chuckles] You were right.

37:23.565 --> 37:28.168
Dark one lies. Dark one tricks.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.838
This hand is nothing but a lump of flesh.

37:30.872 --> 37:34.407
The only thing it did
was give you permission,

37:34.441 --> 37:36.943
permission to be the
man you really are...

37:36.978 --> 37:39.779
not some puppy dog chasing after

37:39.813 --> 37:43.449
the object of his affection,
but a ruthless pirate

37:43.484 --> 37:46.686
who will stop at nothing
to get what he wants.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.355
I did you a favor.

37:48.389 --> 37:52.425
I helped you remember the
darkness that lies beneath.

37:52.459 --> 37:54.927
Then you know that that darkness

37:54.961 --> 37:57.563
will have no problem
crushing Belle's heart.

37:57.598 --> 38:01.066
If you go after my love...

38:01.101 --> 38:04.804
You will surely lose yours.

38:04.838 --> 38:07.472
You threatened my marriage,

38:07.507 --> 38:10.475
tried to destroy the
only light in my life,

38:10.510 --> 38:12.477
and for that,

38:12.512 --> 38:15.781
you will owe me as long as you live.

38:17.284 --> 38:19.785
What if I'm willing to
take you down with me?

38:21.388 --> 38:23.187
I think...

38:23.222 --> 38:27.225
I know you better than
you know yourself, dearie.

38:32.998 --> 38:37.636
So here we are, captain,
still in business together.

38:37.670 --> 38:39.103
I think...

38:39.138 --> 38:43.308
You and I are gonna have some fun.

38:46.312 --> 38:50.214
[Groans]

38:51.650 --> 38:53.151
Oh, bloody hell.

38:53.185 --> 38:54.585
Good morning, sunshine.

38:54.619 --> 38:56.420
Want to tell me why you broke
into the library last night?

38:56.455 --> 38:57.521
The what?

38:57.556 --> 39:00.190
Oh, that's what that place was?

39:00.224 --> 39:02.426
I just thought it was a poorly stocked pub.

39:02.461 --> 39:04.695
Okay, I get it... every
town needs a village idiot,

39:04.729 --> 39:06.497
but your little stunt pulled me away from

39:06.531 --> 39:08.933
an important investigation
and interrupted my night off.

39:08.967 --> 39:10.133
Start talking.

39:10.168 --> 39:12.135
The last thing I remember
is running away from you,

39:12.170 --> 39:15.272
and then I celebrated my escape
with a nice bottle of whiskey.

39:15.306 --> 39:17.274
Did you celebrate
with all your friends...

39:17.308 --> 39:19.242
Alice and the white rabbit?

39:23.314 --> 39:25.382
This was on you in the library.

39:25.416 --> 39:28.250
This was in your pocket.

39:30.988 --> 39:32.655
Mean anything to you?

39:32.690 --> 39:37.193
Nope. Doesn't mean a thing.

39:37.227 --> 39:39.863
How about your eye?

39:39.897 --> 39:42.999
You get a look at whoever
gave you that shiner?

39:43.033 --> 39:44.633
Now, that is an interesting
question, isn't it?

39:44.667 --> 39:46.135
Where were you?

39:46.169 --> 39:48.637
Sorry, love. I just
got your message. I...

39:48.671 --> 39:51.640
it's okay. I just need another minute here.

39:51.674 --> 39:53.709
You were about to tell me
who did that to your face.

39:55.212 --> 39:57.179
It's a bloody mystery to me.

39:57.214 --> 39:59.081
Your guess is as good as mine.

39:59.116 --> 40:00.883
Must have been some party, eh?

40:00.917 --> 40:02.818
[Sniffs]

40:02.852 --> 40:05.220
Well, if you remember anything,

40:05.254 --> 40:07.556
I'll know where to find you.

40:07.590 --> 40:09.691
You're just gonna keep me in here

40:09.726 --> 40:11.527
because I broke into a bloody library?

40:11.561 --> 40:12.628
Because you crashed my date.

40:14.864 --> 40:15.998
Which turned out pretty good,

40:16.032 --> 40:17.899
despite the rude interruption.

40:17.933 --> 40:19.567
What the hell happened to your hand?

40:19.601 --> 40:20.902
It appears the dark one's magic

40:20.936 --> 40:23.038
wasn't all I'd hoped it would be.

40:23.072 --> 40:24.705
Emma, there's something I
need to talk to you about.

40:24.740 --> 40:25.706
Well, make it fast.

40:25.741 --> 40:27.042
I want to go after the snow queen

40:27.076 --> 40:29.344
before the trail gets... cold.

40:29.378 --> 40:30.478
The name the snow queen's

40:30.513 --> 40:31.846
been using in Storybrooke, Sarah Fisher,

40:31.880 --> 40:33.915
that name doesn't appear
anywhere in the census records.

40:33.949 --> 40:36.083
- What does that mean?
- You're right...

40:36.117 --> 40:38.586
She didn't come here by any curse.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.588
Then how did she get here?

40:42.257 --> 40:46.561
What the hell does she want with me?

40:46.595 --> 40:49.096
Henry: Mom.

40:49.130 --> 40:50.630
How's it going?

40:50.665 --> 40:52.966
No progress yet.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.369
Look, I know I might not understand

40:55.403 --> 40:57.771
everything that's going
on with you and Robin Hood,

40:57.805 --> 40:59.106
but there is one thing I understand

40:59.140 --> 41:02.609
better than anyone else...
operation mongoose.

41:02.643 --> 41:03.643
The storybook?

41:03.678 --> 41:05.312
We're gonna find the author,

41:05.346 --> 41:06.646
make him change it.

41:06.681 --> 41:07.981
I think I figured out

41:08.015 --> 41:09.816
who has all the answers we're looking for.

41:09.850 --> 41:10.817
Who?

41:10.851 --> 41:12.752
- My grandpa.
- David?

41:12.787 --> 41:14.654
My other grandpa, Mr. Gold.

41:14.689 --> 41:17.323
Everyone knows Rumplestiltskin
doesn't get a happy ending,

41:17.357 --> 41:18.758
but look at him now.

41:18.793 --> 41:20.226
He just married Belle.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.896
He must have figured out
how to change his story,

41:22.930 --> 41:25.098
which means he might
know who wrote the book.

41:25.132 --> 41:28.267
And I'm the last person
he'd ever share that with.

41:28.302 --> 41:30.136
That's why I'm gonna find out for you.

41:30.170 --> 41:32.105
How?

41:32.139 --> 41:34.474
By going undercover.

41:36.276 --> 41:38.311
A job?

41:38.345 --> 41:40.112
You know, after school and weekends.

41:40.146 --> 41:42.114
Now that my father's gone,

41:42.148 --> 41:44.650
I realized that you're the
closest thing I've got to him,

41:46.352 --> 41:47.987
but I-if you don't want me around...

41:48.021 --> 41:50.990
No, well...

41:51.024 --> 41:52.091
All right.

41:52.125 --> 41:54.994
A few days a week. But, uh...

41:56.329 --> 41:58.296
stay out of the back room,

41:58.331 --> 42:00.132
and don't touch anything without asking.

42:01.534 --> 42:03.267
You can be my apprentice.

42:03.301 --> 42:05.336
What does an apprentice do?

42:05.370 --> 42:07.838
Many, many things.

42:07.872 --> 42:10.608
First, you can start by sweeping the floor.
