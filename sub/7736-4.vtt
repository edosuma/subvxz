<i>Breakfast any time.</i>

00:27.770 --> 00:31.482
- [yelling] Yes!
- Can you please keep it down in there?

00:31.566 --> 00:33.026
<i>- [Bill] Sorry, Mom.
- [Kevin] All right.</i>

[crunching noise on TV]
[kids scream]

00:35.028 --> 00:38.948
- [sighs] Sorry about that.
- Jesus, Sue, ever hear of a diaphragm?

00:39.032 --> 00:41.159
Anyway, congratulations.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.087
You're the top Plast-A-Ware
neighborhood sales

00:43.110 --> 00:48.083
- liaison for September!
- [gasps] Gee, this is so special.

00:48.166 --> 00:51.251
I haven't won anything since my high
school softball team went to State.

00:51.335 --> 00:55.423
Oh, my goodness. Look at this.

00:55.506 --> 00:56.507
What is it?

00:56.591 --> 01:00.011
- It's a telephone answering machine.
- A what?

01:00.095 --> 01:03.223
When you're not home, the
machine will answer the phone

01:03.305 --> 01:06.059
and let the caller leave
a message on cassette tape.

01:06.142 --> 01:08.144
It helps me keep track of my orders.

01:08.228 --> 01:11.106
And it's the official
answering machine of NASA.

01:11.189 --> 01:14.567
- Oh, this must've cost a fortune.
- Well, you earned it.

01:14.650 --> 01:17.237
- This is so cool.
- Oh, man, it's like we're rich now!

01:17.319 --> 01:20.823
Well, you're all set.
Now you'll never miss a sales call,

01:20.907 --> 01:24.264
which could come in handy
because we might have an

01:24.265 --> 01:27.622
opening soon for a part-time,
level two sales manager.

01:27.705 --> 01:29.498
[gasps] Level two?

01:29.582 --> 01:31.209
Wow. Really?

01:31.291 --> 01:34.754
It's not definite yet, but it
would be a couple days a week,

01:34.837 --> 01:37.132
and we'd pay you... with money.

01:37.215 --> 01:39.634
[gasps] That would be wonderful.

01:39.717 --> 01:43.387
But, oh, of course, I'd
have to ask Frank about it.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.406
Of course you would. I'll keep my ear

01:45.407 --> 01:48.309
to the ground and let you
know if the job opens up.

01:48.392 --> 01:51.545

you might drive your own

Oh, your husband seems to like mine.</i>

01:55.441 --> 01:59.279
Hey, Vic, did you park this
pimpmobile in front of my house?

01:59.361 --> 02:02.907
Not me, kemo sabe, but that color rocks!

02:02.991 --> 02:05.285
It's mine, Frank, and
I was just leaving.

02:05.910 --> 02:09.788
[gasps] Victor?
Look at you, all grown up.

02:09.872 --> 02:13.584
Oh, my sweet Jesus, it's Miss Saunders.

02:13.668 --> 02:15.295
I can't believe my eyes.

02:15.377 --> 02:18.089
- You two know each other?
- Oh, yeah.

02:18.714 --> 02:21.801
Miss Saunders was my lunch
lady at Eisenhower High.

02:21.884 --> 02:25.096
And he was my special
after-school helper.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.765
Remember how we "cleaned the kitchen"?

02:27.849 --> 02:30.392
Yeah, you "fucked the shit outta me."

02:30.476 --> 02:33.021
Jesus Christ, Vic, show some respect!

02:33.104 --> 02:36.357
Sorry, neighbor, it's not
me speaking, it's my Chi.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.818

02:38.901 --> 02:40.320

Bye, Sue.

02:43.198 --> 02:46.117
Honey, I got some big news for you. Big!

02:46.909 --> 02:48.077
Gather around, kids!

02:48.161 --> 02:51.122
Mr. Dunbarton, the
CEO of Mohican Airways,

02:51.206 --> 02:55.877
awarded your father the "Tie Tack
of Excellence," given only to...

02:55.960 --> 02:58.087
- Mommy won an answering machine.
- A what?

02:58.171 --> 02:59.922
Um... [nervous chuckle]

03:00.006 --> 03:02.550
It's like a robot that answers
your phone. It's nothing, really.

03:02.633 --> 03:05.761
- It cost 180 bucks.
- Jesus.

03:05.845 --> 03:07.680
Mm, I'm sure they buy them in bulk.

03:07.763 --> 03:10.683
So what were you saying? I want
to hear all about your tie clip.

03:10.766 --> 03:15.063
Tie tack. It's the highest
award given to only a select f...

03:15.146 --> 03:18.066
- Wow, this thing has two tapes!
- How do they do that?

03:18.149 --> 03:21.027
Christ, you people don't even
give a shit, do ya? Let's eat.

03:22.362 --> 03:24.509
I'm a mockery in my own goddamn house.

03:24.510 --> 03:26.657
I might as well go
sleep in the basement.

03:26.741 --> 03:29.285
Well, before you do, I
have a little bit of news.

03:29.369 --> 03:30.953
Vivian...
[phone ringing]

03:31.037 --> 03:33.373
Ah, shit, every time we go to sit down!

03:33.455 --> 03:35.124
I'll tell you right now
I'm not answering it!

03:35.208 --> 03:36.876
You don't have to! The machine will.

03:37.919 --> 03:41.005
<i>[robotic voice] Leave

04:08.657 --> 04:11.452
- Hooray for us.
- You tell him to get here now!

04:11.535 --> 04:14.414

- Man, this is nothing.

05:16.142 --> 05:19.020
Did I ever tell you about
the Slow-Down of '63?

05:19.103 --> 05:21.105
We didn't start it till '64.

Bob, my union brothers
are working just as fast

05:38.247 --> 05:42.210
as Mohican Airways has responded
to our request for a new contract.

05:42.293 --> 05:46.047
And to think I once gave
you one of my old suits.

05:46.130 --> 05:47.673
And I appreciated that.

05:47.756 --> 05:51.093
I used it to upholster my couch.
And two chairs.

05:51.177 --> 05:54.638
And with the leftover material,
I made a cover for my pool.

OK, Bob, I'm here.

this illegal slow-down...

06:26.421 --> 06:28.993
It's just gonna make the company
dig their heels in harder.

06:29.028 --> 06:31.300
Oh. Well, did Dunbarton tell
you that at the country club

06:31.384 --> 06:32.843
when you were gargling on his nuts?

06:32.927 --> 06:35.054
Jesus Christ, it was one football game.

06:35.137 --> 06:36.514
Come on, I want to help you guys out.

06:36.556 --> 06:39.434
You want to help?
Tell your buddy Dunbarton this:

06:39.517 --> 06:42.728
if we don't have a fair contract
by midnight on Christmas Eve,

06:42.811 --> 06:45.523
the entire membership of
this union will go on strike.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.150
Christmas is our busiest time,
that'll kill the airline.

06:48.234 --> 06:49.609
You've got some work to do.

06:49.693 --> 06:53.197
And you? You just sit on
your ass and do nothing.

06:53.281 --> 06:56.742
This is good. We can work on
our screenplay for Fuck School.

According to this book I read,

07:51.839 --> 07:54.425
Then I have to go get some
shitty job at the airport

07:54.509 --> 07:56.885

- You leave them with me.
- Yeah, but that's our deal.

into when you let me get into you.

OK, uh, yeah.

09:46.036 --> 09:51.083
Uh, she-she did mention that to me,
and it, uh, breaks my heart to tell you,

but, uh... she decided to turn it down.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.547
- Really?
- Afraid so.

09:56.631 --> 09:58.132
She said there's no job more important

than being a mother to
three beautiful miracles.

seemed real excited about it.

10:09.602 --> 10:13.564
Yeah, she was just being polite to
an older lady. Her words, not mine.

10:13.648 --> 10:17.276
Hm. So sorry to hear that.
I'll move on to the next candidate.

10:17.359 --> 10:19.413

I like your costume.

They're from the Johnny
Carson collection!

11:22.341 --> 11:24.719

your pelts into a comforter

11:30.850 --> 11:33.143

11:33.227 --> 11:38.858

best pelt-fucking I ever got, Jimmy."

11:38.940 --> 11:42.653

- I will gut you! [boys gasp]

- [scoffs] Pogo.

use a garden hose and

12:02.123 --> 12:03.424

in the executive bathroom,

12:10.097 --> 12:13.225

comes out one square at a time.

Those are all legitimate grievances.
And I hear you,

12:24.661 --> 12:26.822
but the industry is changing
whether we like it or not,

12:26.906 --> 12:29.408

compromises on both sides.

12:29.491 --> 12:30.950
I'm dealing with change in my own life.

12:31.034 --> 12:33.287
For instance, my wife just
got this new answering machine,

12:33.370 --> 12:34.830
and at first I was
afraid of it, but now...

12:34.914 --> 12:37.625
- She got a who?
- It's called an answering machine.

12:37.708 --> 12:40.281
It answers the phone for
you and records messages.

12:40.332 --> 12:42.913
- But my point is...
- You mean there's like a little robot

12:42.948 --> 12:43.881

the phone and goes...

12:43.963 --> 12:45.758

- Do it yourself. I'm not going out tonight.

- I don't feel well.
- Mm, your forehead's cool.

13:05.736 --> 13:08.489
Take a little nap. After that,
you'll feel like trick-or-treating.

Ow! Stop it! Ow! 
[grunting]

21:09.761 --> 21:11.012
[Bill] That hurts!

21:11.596 --> 21:13.348
[kids clamoring]
[Bill grunts]

21:15.058 --> 21:16.559
[yells]
[Bill groans]

21:16.643 --> 21:18.603
[kids clamoring]

21:19.938 --> 21:22.107
<i>- [Bill] Ah! [grunts]
- [kid] Whoo-hoo!</i>

21:22.190 --> 21:24.276
[groans]
[kids cheering]

21:25.068 --> 21:29.572
Look at me, I'm Haystacks
Calhoun! [grunts, laughing]

21:30.573 --> 21:34.704
Oh, man, he's flat.
I think I killed him!

21:35.162 --> 21:38.165
<i>- [boy] There's no blood.
- Must've killed that, too.</i>

21:38.248 --> 21:39.666
[panting]

21:40.292 --> 21:41.918
He got away!

21:43.503 --> 21:47.048
You better stay in your
house forever, Murphy!

21:47.132 --> 21:51.511
<i>[panting]
If you ever set foot outside again,</i>

21:51.594 --> 21:55.664
<i>I will fucking mutilate you!
[sobbing]</i>

21:55.890 --> 21:57.684
Fucking asshole!

21:57.767 --> 21:59.560
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

21:59.644 --> 22:03.482
- You're the man, Jimmy.
- Oh, I know. It's a lot of pressure.

22:03.564 --> 22:07.068
Daddy, where is this great
trick-or-treat neighborhood?

22:07.152 --> 22:08.903
Ah, it's around here somewhere.

22:09.654 --> 22:10.989
<i>[Frank] Goddamn it!</i>

22:11.072 --> 22:14.993
Whoa!
Shit, Murph, that was your dad's car!

22:15.076 --> 22:18.079
[slurring] I know! 
I threw it, and then it hit it.

22:18.163 --> 22:19.498
[all laughing]

22:19.580 --> 22:23.995
Whoever ruined my paint job is
lucky my wife just left me or I'd...

22:24.543 --> 22:28.047
Has anybody seen her?! Huh?

22:29.716 --> 22:30.717
[car door slams shut]

22:30.800 --> 22:33.470
I gotta get to the stupid
library before it closes.

22:33.552 --> 22:36.597
I still have to answer that
fucking history question.

22:36.681 --> 22:39.726
I know history. History of drugs.

22:39.809 --> 22:41.978
[all laughing]
Uh, what's the question?

22:42.062 --> 22:44.772
What president served the shortest term?

22:44.856 --> 22:49.361
- William Henry Harrison, 31 days.
- How the hell do you know that?

22:49.444 --> 22:51.279
It's presidential trivia.

22:51.363 --> 22:55.405
It's on the label of every
bottle of White House beer.

22:56.868 --> 22:59.829
Homework done. I'm a fucking genius.

22:59.913 --> 23:02.581
<i>[Frank] It's around here somewhere.</i>

23:02.665 --> 23:05.419
<i>[Maureen] This is where
Mommy buys macramé yarn.</i>

23:05.502 --> 23:06.961
<i>[Frank] Exactly.</i>

23:07.045 --> 23:11.174
- Shit.
- You're not taking me trick-or-treating!

23:11.258 --> 23:14.177
- You're looking for Mommy!
- OK, sweetheart.

23:14.261 --> 23:16.637
Uh, when we find Mommy and
you tell her to forgive me,

23:16.721 --> 23:18.432
then you can go trick-or-treat.

23:18.515 --> 23:20.934
And if it's too late, I'll
go by the grocery store

23:21.017 --> 23:22.727
and I'll get you all
the candy you want, OK?

23:22.810 --> 23:24.521
[voice breaking] It's not the same.

23:24.603 --> 23:28.567
You're right, you're right, I know.
Let's just find Mom first.

23:28.568 --> 23:33.554
[sad music plays]

23:39.244 --> 23:43.323
[bat cracks] Well, that's either
your mother or Boog Powell.

23:51.465 --> 23:55.035
Hey. Still mad at me?
[grunts]

23:56.261 --> 23:59.889
OK. Look, I just want you
to know that I know this is,

23:59.973 --> 24:02.142
this is definitely the worst
thing I ever did to you.

24:02.225 --> 24:03.768
<i>Except for that thing in Harrisburg,</i>

24:03.851 --> 24:06.512
<i>which I'm now realizing
I never told you about.</i>

24:06.547 --> 24:09.524
But I'm not apologizing for that,
I'm talking about this.

24:09.608 --> 24:12.715
Look, I got upset. Maybe
I overreacted a little bit

24:12.716 --> 24:16.658
to things changing. And I
just want to say I'm sorry.

24:17.282 --> 24:18.866
[grunts]
[fence clanging]

24:19.409 --> 24:21.021
Nice rip.

24:22.496 --> 24:25.248
I'm just really, really sorry.

24:26.124 --> 24:29.877
OK?
Does, uh, does that make it better?

24:29.961 --> 24:31.338
We, uh, we good now?

24:31.421 --> 24:33.590
No, Frank. Those are just words.

24:33.672 --> 24:36.510
They don't mean anything
unless you back 'em up. [grunts]

24:36.593 --> 24:40.013
Look... I love you, and I love the kids,

24:40.096 --> 24:43.475
but I need more... for myself.

24:43.558 --> 24:45.435
- Oh, Jesus.
- What was that?

24:45.519 --> 24:48.229
- Nothing, nothing.
- When Vivian mentioned that job,

24:48.313 --> 24:52.192
my first thought was what
your reaction would be.

24:52.275 --> 24:54.277
I didn't consider what I wanted.

24:54.361 --> 24:59.649
It made me think, "How did I
become this person?" [sighs]

24:59.684 --> 25:01.284
So I called her tonight
and I took that job.

25:01.368 --> 25:05.500
I start next week, and you
need to be OK with that.

25:05.580 --> 25:08.082
Wow. OK, uh...

25:08.166 --> 25:11.752
- Yes. I'm OK with it.
- Good.

25:12.146 --> 25:14.607
<i>Hi, Bill. I'm glad
you're feeling better.</i>

25:14.691 --> 25:19.792
- [Maureen] It's me, Mommy!
- Maureen? Hi, sweetie.

25:19.827 --> 25:21.489
You let her be Mr. Coconut?

25:21.572 --> 25:24.908
It won't be an easy life for her, 
but it's the choice she made.

25:24.943 --> 25:26.649
[chuckling]

25:26.684 --> 25:29.037
So, uh... what do you say?
You ready to come home?

25:29.121 --> 25:33.041
Uh, I'll be home soon.
I paid for 300 pitches.

25:33.225 --> 25:37.145
- I was pretty mad at you.
- OK. Sure. I'll see you at home later.

25:37.229 --> 25:38.280
Just keep that elbow up.

25:38.281 --> 25:39.857
You're not getting through
the zone fast enough.

25:39.983 --> 25:41.275
[ball flying, hits fence]

25:41.358 --> 25:44.512
- Just do what you want!
- Thanks, honey.

25:46.363 --> 25:47.364
[grunts]

25:47.448 --> 25:51.953
- Let's go trick-or-treat now.
- I don't want to anymore. I'm hungry.

25:52.036 --> 25:55.957
- Didn't you eat? I made ziti.
- You poured it on everybody's candy.

25:56.040 --> 25:59.209
That's right, I did.
I'll make you some cereal.

26:01.004 --> 26:02.170

[car starts]
