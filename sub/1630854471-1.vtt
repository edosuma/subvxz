01:55.282 --> 01:56.950
Hey! Hey!

01:57.951 --> 01:59.578
What the fuck...?

01:59.578 --> 02:02.164
Put those back. You’re shoplifting.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.415

You are shoplifting."

- Somen.
- Let's get out of here, man.

- Good, good. Glad to hear.

03:14.403 --> 03:18.991
- Revenue is up 15% over last month.
- In no small part thanks to you.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.410

Oh, don't be modest.</i>

03:21.410 --> 03:23.954

03:23.954 --> 03:25.372

Listen, I want you to come
over for lunch this weekend.

03:38.135 --> 03:41.221
- Sir?
- Mrs. Singh is making
her famous mutton saag.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.696
Thank you, sir.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.115
Hard-working, reliable, clever.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.367
So, is everything to your liking?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.786
Yes, the mutton saag is divine.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.747
Good, good, good.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.582
Thank you so much for this.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.083
My pleasure.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.377
Which is why
I want to promote you.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.299
Promote me?
To general manager.

04:17.299 --> 04:20.886
I want you to oversee operations
to all of my seven gas stations.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.600
I greatly appreciate your offer.

04:30.354 --> 04:33.440
But I'm afraid I can't accept.
- What?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.734
I've been meaning
to speak with you about this

04:35.734 --> 04:37.110
for some time now, sir.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.404
I have made the decision to leave.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.281
But what will you do?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.116
How much money have you saved?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.536
As of Monday, $44,000.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.205
$44,000? How is that possible?

04:48.205 --> 04:51.208
Actually, it's $44,155.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.418
I rounded down because
I didn't want to brag,

04:53.418 --> 04:56.046
but you pay me $2.60 an hour.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.216
Multiply that by 70 hours a week,
52 weeks a year, by five years.

04:59.216 --> 05:03.262
That comes to $52,000, of which
I have managed to save 90%.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.222
Ninety?

05:05.222 --> 05:07.391
I have no social life to speak of, sir.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.853
<i>All I do is sleep and work.</i>

05:10.853 --> 05:14.940
<i>For food, I eat expired
sandwiches from the station.</i>

05:14.940 --> 05:16.733
<i>If you have $44,000,</i>

05:16.733 --> 05:19.194
<i>that's nearly enough
to own your own gas station.</i>

05:19.194 --> 05:21.238
<i>That's true.</i>

05:21.238 --> 05:23.574
<i>So why not just work with me
for a few more years--</i>

05:23.574 --> 05:25.868
Sir, I do not want a gas station.

05:25.868 --> 05:28.412
What do you mean
you don't want a gas station?

05:28.412 --> 05:30.998

06:33.352 --> 06:35.020
Is this some sort of joke?

06:35.020 --> 06:37.022
Now, imagine if
there were an establishment

06:37.022 --> 06:39.066
where people could gather together to play

06:39.066 --> 06:40.943

06:54.790 --> 06:56.834
So, what are you going
to do with the place?

06:56.834 --> 06:59.878
It's going to be a backgammon club.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.506

07:05.509 --> 07:07.678

I'll tell you what's fuckin' goin' on.

36:19.596 --> 36:22.349
Peter fuckin' Bogdanovich,

36:22.349 --> 36:24.017
I don't know what that means.

36:24.017 --> 36:26.270
Oh, he's a major fuckin'
Hollywood director, Steve,

36:26.270 --> 36:28.939
and he just asked Dorothy
to read for his new film.

36:28.939 --> 36:30.816
- Isn't that good?
- No.

36:30.816 --> 36:33.777
It's not fuckin' good, Steve,
it's fuckin' horrible.

36:33.777 --> 36:35.863
- Why is it horrible?
- Aw, jeez.

36:35.863 --> 36:38.574
Do I have to explain
every fuckin' thing to you?

36:38.574 --> 36:40.951
What it means, Steve,

36:40.951 --> 36:43.579
is that he is going to fuck her.

36:43.579 --> 36:45.163
And when he fucks her,

36:45.163 --> 36:46.665
he's going to steal her away from me.

36:46.665 --> 36:48.584

- Where are you getting this from?

36:48.584 --> 36:51.295

this shit works, Steve!

36:51.295 --> 36:53.630

36:53.630 --> 36:55.883
