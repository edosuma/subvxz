Wow.

00:16.768 --> 00:18.019
Yeah.

00:20.814 --> 00:24.651
Oh, it's like a flashback
to, uh, senior year.

00:24.734 --> 00:28.697
Except, you don't taste like
strawberries anymore. [Chuckles]

00:28.780 --> 00:30.990
Spice Girls discontinued
their lip gloss.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.158
Oh.

00:33.952 --> 00:36.204
We should probably talk about this.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.707
- [Colt chuckles]
- Hmm.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.709
Are you gonna tell me what you want?

00:40.792 --> 00:42.512
- What you really, really want?
- [chuckles]

00:43.753 --> 00:45.296
I'm serious.

00:46.339 --> 00:48.257
Well, okay.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.559
- [Abby breathes heavily] Okay...
- Mmm...

00:57.642 --> 00:59.185
I'm going to, um...

01:00.103 --> 01:01.663
I'm gonna talk to you from back here...

01:01.730 --> 01:02.897
Okay.

01:02.981 --> 01:04.649
So I can get through this.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.776
Okay, look. I know
what you're gonna say,

01:07.318 --> 01:08.987
but this is not a mistake.

01:11.155 --> 01:14.200
Actually, I was gonna
say I want this, too.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.244
Fuck, yeah!

01:17.954 --> 01:20.373
It's just... Kenny.

01:20.456 --> 01:21.625
I mean, we just got engaged.

01:21.708 --> 01:22.959
Kenny. Right.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.836
[sighs] This is gonna kill him.

01:25.712 --> 01:28.214
Yeah... I'm sorry.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.675
[stammers] It's really gonna suck.

01:30.759 --> 01:32.510
[Abby sighs]

01:32.593 --> 01:33.637
So...

01:35.722 --> 01:37.348
you wanna go to a movie or somethin'?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.892
[chuckles]

01:40.309 --> 01:41.477
Colt, before we do anything,

01:41.560 --> 01:43.772
I need to break things off with Kenny.

01:43.855 --> 01:45.148
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:45.231 --> 01:47.483
And you can't say
anything to anybody, okay?

01:47.566 --> 01:51.237
I don't want him hearing
anything until I can talk to him.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.823
All right? [Stammers] And
you are terrible with secrets.

01:53.907 --> 01:55.116
[chuckles] No, I'm not.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.493
You told me Rooster peed
the bed until he was 14.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.203
That's a funny secret!

02:02.581 --> 02:03.934
I can't believe this is happening.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.334
Yeah.

02:05.418 --> 02:06.460
[both chuckle]

02:06.544 --> 02:08.378
I mean, it's great. It's great...

02:08.461 --> 02:10.089
- Yeah.
- It's just...

02:11.090 --> 02:13.384
Okay, look, maybe I
should... maybe I should go.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.320
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Yeah. So I'll just...

02:15.344 --> 02:17.263
- [softly] Okay...
- I'll just do that.

02:21.726 --> 02:23.621
Okay, seriously, you need
to leave now. [Chuckles]

02:23.645 --> 02:24.747
- Yep, I'm going.
- You can... You go.

02:24.771 --> 02:27.231
- That's what I'm doing.
- But I'm serious.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.650
You have to keep this quiet.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.069
Yes. I'm not gonna say anything.

02:32.403 --> 02:33.529
Bye.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.369
Fuck, yeah!

02:45.124 --> 02:47.794

03:48.229 --> 03:49.331
[Rooster] Hey, check it out.

03:49.355 --> 03:52.901
I discovered if you run out of milk,
you can use beer to make pancakes.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.236
We out of milk?

03:55.319 --> 03:57.321
Nope, but once you figure
out you can use beer,

03:57.405 --> 03:58.614
why would you go back to milk?

04:00.116 --> 04:01.951
Hey, hey, check this out.

04:02.035 --> 04:03.077
Boom.

04:03.161 --> 04:04.429
Oh, what's the Southern Comfort for?

04:04.453 --> 04:05.914
Syrup.

04:05.997 --> 04:07.916
Hey, hey, hey.

04:07.999 --> 04:10.501
You are not gonna believe
what happened last night.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.744
Oh, what happened last night?

04:12.921 --> 04:15.298
You know what? Actually,
uh, can't tell you.

04:15.381 --> 04:16.800
Okay.

04:16.882 --> 04:21.137
Yeah, I... I promised this, uh, person
that I wouldn't say anything. So...

04:21.220 --> 04:22.263
No problem.

04:23.222 --> 04:27.143
But, uh, you know, I can say
there was a kiss. [Chuckles]

04:28.895 --> 04:31.355
And it was not too shabby. [Chuckles]

04:32.523 --> 04:34.901
As in, "Shh... Abby." [chuckles]

04:36.444 --> 04:37.486
I'm talking about Abby.

04:37.570 --> 04:39.155
Yeah, I get it.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.908
Your ability to keep
secrets is shh... itty.

04:43.201 --> 04:45.787
Whatever, man. Just don't
say anything to anyone.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.456
I don't know, Colt. I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to resist.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.835
[mocking] OMG! Did you hear?

04:51.918 --> 04:54.420
Colt and Abby is totes going out!

04:54.503 --> 04:55.797
[chuckling]

04:56.297 --> 04:58.424
- Hashtag, don't give a shit.
- [chuckles]

04:59.592 --> 05:01.094
[Colt] Mornin', Dad!

05:01.177 --> 05:02.720
Hey, Dad. Want some of these pancakes?

05:02.804 --> 05:04.097
Oh, you're not gonna be driving

05:04.180 --> 05:06.099
or operating heavy
machinery in a bit, are you?

05:06.850 --> 05:09.393
No, but I got somethin'
I wanna say to you two.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.563
All right, well, it's Colt's
fault. I'll hold him. You hit him.

05:13.815 --> 05:16.442
As surprised as I am to
hear myself saying this...

05:17.068 --> 05:18.694
you didn't do anything wrong.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.990
Okay, this is weird. I don't like this.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.827
I can't remember a time
we've worked so hard

05:25.910 --> 05:27.954
and things looked so bleak around here.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.750
Between your mom leavin'
and... tight money,

05:32.834 --> 05:34.418
sick cattle...

05:36.462 --> 05:37.505
the drought...

05:38.506 --> 05:40.591
Hell, just being old and tired.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.136
I couldn't have done it without you two.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.264
Well, I'll drink to that.

05:48.641 --> 05:49.808
That means a lot, Daddy.

05:49.893 --> 05:51.519
Sit down. Don't make this weird.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.233
It's not a lot, but
it's better than nothing.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.359
Whoa!

05:59.068 --> 06:01.779
Whoa! I ain't seen an
envelope of money like this

06:01.862 --> 06:03.447
since I got recruited to USC.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.718
I would have been touched
without the money, Dad.

06:06.742 --> 06:09.954
But if you think I deserve it,
then I accept your generous gift.

06:10.038 --> 06:14.542
And I promise to dedicate this money
to locally sourced females and alcohol.

06:16.252 --> 06:17.711
Do what you want with it.

06:17.795 --> 06:21.090
Just don't get any diseases
you're gonna pass on to the cattle.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.384
Gotcha.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.013
You earned it.

06:27.096 --> 06:29.182
I'm proud to be partner with you boys.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.978
Did he just call us partners?

06:35.063 --> 06:37.663
I don't know. I think I blacked
out when he said, "You earned it."

06:39.150 --> 06:41.586
Man, looks like he finally recognized
all the work we do around here.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.737
[sighs] Man, he's really recognizing it.

06:43.821 --> 06:46.407
- How much did you get?
- I don't know. How much did you get?

06:46.490 --> 06:48.760
- Well, it better be more than you.
- Why? We're partners.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.245
Yeah, but dude, I'm a 15-year partner.

06:51.329 --> 06:54.707
You're like a, you know, Aquaman with
the Justice League kind of partner.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.435
Like when the shit goes
down and they're like,

06:56.459 --> 06:59.545
"Whoa, somebody's gotta stay back here
and watch the headquarters, Aquaman."

07:01.297 --> 07:03.091
Oh, I guess Daddy disagrees. [Scoffs]

07:03.174 --> 07:04.717
There's no way you got as much as me.

07:05.343 --> 07:07.023
All right, tell you
what. Give me that pen.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.887
We'll write down how much we got...

07:08.972 --> 07:11.015
and on the count of three,
we show it to each other.

07:11.099 --> 07:12.141
Fine.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.065
Ready?

07:19.148 --> 07:21.650
[both] One, two, three.

07:21.734 --> 07:23.819
[both] "Fuck you." Fuck you!

07:28.491 --> 07:29.575
[Colt] Whoa!

07:31.119 --> 07:33.787
- Look at this bad boy, F-350.
- Yeah.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.707
Man, I haven't seen a truck like
this since you got recruited by USC.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.335
Man, if this truck was mine,

07:39.418 --> 07:41.629
the first thing I'd do is
drive to the top of a mountain

07:41.712 --> 07:44.007
and let an eagle land on my hand.

07:45.133 --> 07:46.259
That'd be badass.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.595
- Guess this is Ed's rig.
- Ed?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.847
Oh, Ed Bishop? How do you know that?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.641
License plate says, "Ed's Rig."

07:56.144 --> 07:58.396
If that was my license
plate, it'd say "'Merica."

07:58.479 --> 07:59.522
With a capital M.

07:59.605 --> 08:02.483
[Rooster chuckles]
That'd be badass, too.

08:04.110 --> 08:07.030
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Whoa-ho! Ed's here! Hide the beer!

08:07.738 --> 08:10.449
- Hey, Rooster's here! Hide the sheep!
- [Rooster laughs]

08:11.284 --> 08:12.886
- Good to see you.
- What's up man? You good?

08:12.910 --> 08:14.888
- All right. Good to see you, Colt.
- Hey. How are you, Ed?

08:14.912 --> 08:16.306
Hey, your brother still screwing sheep?

08:16.330 --> 08:18.791
- [all laughing]
- What's new, Ed?

08:18.874 --> 08:21.544
His truck, his hip and his wife.

08:23.046 --> 08:25.423
Sorry to hear that.
You and Jocelyn split?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.675
Yeah, it was real dark
there for a lot of years.

08:27.758 --> 08:30.886
Then I met my new 38-year-old wife.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.638
Did I mention that she's 38?

08:32.721 --> 08:33.806
- [Rooster] Yeah.
- Yeah?

08:33.889 --> 08:36.350
Hear that, Rooster? His wife's
younger than your girlfriend.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.062
[chuckles] Yeah, well, your
girlfriend's engaged to Kenny.

08:39.145 --> 08:42.565
Dude! He's not supposed to say anything.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.275
She's not my girlfriend.

08:45.276 --> 08:48.154
We did kiss. I mean, she's pretty
into me. I can't tell you who, though.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.947
It's Abby. We're back.

08:51.282 --> 08:53.201
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.453
So, your dad and I were just talking

08:55.536 --> 08:57.913
about that fishing trip we
all took up to Diamond Lake.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.349
- [laughs]
- [Ed] Hey, you remember

08:59.373 --> 09:02.335
when Rooster was trying to help
us guide the boat into the lake?

09:02.418 --> 09:04.002
"Back up! Back up!"

09:04.087 --> 09:06.464
- [both] "Too far!"
- [all chuckling]

09:06.547 --> 09:09.508
The only thing we fished out of
the water that day was my truck.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.676
[Colt] Yeah.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.696
Remember Mom was trying
to take a nap in the back?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.180
She almost drowned. [Chuckles]

09:14.263 --> 09:15.639
That part wasn't funny, though.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.767
Say, where is Maggie anyway?

09:19.685 --> 09:22.020
We separated a while back.

09:22.105 --> 09:23.231
Then she left me.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.944
Well, glad I brought that up.

09:31.322 --> 09:33.116
Well, look at that truck, Ed.

09:33.199 --> 09:35.076
What's that, a 6.7 liter power stroke?

09:35.159 --> 09:36.952
That's a beast.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.580
Man, Ed. New truck,
new wife... killing it!

09:39.663 --> 09:40.873
You're an assassin.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.041
You wanna take her for a spin?

09:43.126 --> 09:44.543
What? The truck or your wife?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.545
[laughs] That's funny.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.132
You know I was a sniper
in the Marines, right?

09:51.134 --> 09:54.220
You are an assassin. A literal assassin.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.348
Oh, I call shotgun! [Chuckles]

09:57.431 --> 09:58.724
Could've called driver, dummy.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.935
Yeah, well, if I'm drivin', how am
I gonna moon the Chevy dealership?

10:03.896 --> 10:05.231
It's good to see them.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.815
That'll wear off quick.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.067
Want another beer?

10:09.152 --> 10:11.445
What do you say we break this out, hmm?

10:13.531 --> 10:15.866
Damn, Ed, that's some fancy whiskey.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.619
What else you hiding
in that purse of yours?

10:19.412 --> 10:21.830
Well, you still enjoy
a good cigar, right?

10:22.498 --> 10:24.750
Does Dolly Parton sleep on her back?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.377
[laughs]

10:26.460 --> 10:27.711
Let's go out on the porch.

10:28.546 --> 10:30.464
I feel a sales pitch coming on.

10:30.548 --> 10:31.799
Sounds good.

10:31.882 --> 10:35.261
Say, did I mention to you
that my wife's only 38?

10:35.344 --> 10:36.887
Yeah, you did. Twice.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.097
Oh, that's 'cause my memory's slippin'.

10:39.182 --> 10:42.518
But hers is still sharp
'cause she's only 38.

10:42.601 --> 10:43.644
[laughs]

10:49.192 --> 10:52.069
You gonna go right to
convincing me to sell my ranch?

10:52.153 --> 10:55.030
Or we got time for a
couple of drinks first?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.713
Does Neumann's Hill want me to come back

10:56.782 --> 10:59.743
and tell them the great Beau
Bennett wants to partner up with us?

10:59.827 --> 11:03.872
Of course. But we both know
you're never gonna go for that.

11:03.956 --> 11:08.169
So let me get through my pitch,
go back and tell 'em I did my job,

11:08.252 --> 11:10.921
and we can get back to
drinking on their dime.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.592
You're almost as smooth
as this whiskey, Ed.

11:15.218 --> 11:17.845
Well, Neumann's Hill
didn't pick me for my looks.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.263
Neither did your new wife.

11:19.347 --> 11:20.473
[chuckles]

11:24.810 --> 11:27.104
You know, Beau, when I was a rancher...

11:27.187 --> 11:29.690
I never would have let anybody
take over my place, either.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.442
That's not what we do.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.569
You still own your land.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.947
We just pay you a guaranteed
price to raise the cattle for us.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.868
And you'll never have to worry about
having another bad year in your life.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.953
I'll never have a great year, either.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.830
I'm not here to sell you anything.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.164
I'll drink to that.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.460
Why does my napkin say, "Fuck you"?

11:51.795 --> 11:53.672
I knew you were coming by, Ed.

11:54.423 --> 11:55.508
[chuckles]

11:56.634 --> 11:58.927
- [guitars strumming]
- [musicians singing]

12:00.596 --> 12:02.491
- Oh, look at these guys. What's up, Bills?
- Hey.

12:02.515 --> 12:05.726
- Oh, hey, Nikki. Hey, Beer Pong.
- What's up Nikki? What you guys doin'?

12:05.809 --> 12:08.812
Three month anniversary.
We just finished dinner.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.064
We're gonna catch a movie
at 8:20 in Telluride.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.817
Oh, 8:20? Cuttin' that one close.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.486
That's what the sirens are for.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.654
[laughing]

12:17.237 --> 12:19.615
Okay, I'm gonna pee before we go.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.368
I can't let anyone see me
get up during the movie.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.036
We reserved the handicapped seats.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.162
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

12:25.245 --> 12:27.456
What's awesome about it is
if someone calls you on it,

12:27.540 --> 12:28.582
you just act deaf.

12:28.666 --> 12:30.751
[laughs] I like that.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.711
Hey, Bucky. Two.

12:32.795 --> 12:33.879
Make it three.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.758
Hey, you guys know
anybody who needs a truck?

12:37.841 --> 12:38.967
Talking about the Bronco?

12:39.968 --> 12:42.930
Oh, man! I boned Melissa
Richards in that truck.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.056
[chuckles]

12:44.139 --> 12:46.451
- I boned Melissa Richards in that truck.
- [Rooster laughs]

12:46.475 --> 12:49.269
I was dating Melissa Richards
when I bought that truck.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.321
Seriously, man. Why you
wanna sell that truck?

12:52.356 --> 12:53.899
The Bronco is awesome.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.067
I need some cash.

12:55.150 --> 12:58.195
Dude, you're a cop. Just
break into the evidence room.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.199
I'm thinking about making
an honest woman of her.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.576
I'm gonna buy a ring.

13:03.659 --> 13:05.911
Whoa! Mrs. Beer Pong!

13:05.994 --> 13:07.287
After only three months?

13:07.371 --> 13:08.914
Man, you see that girl?

13:08.997 --> 13:10.916
Ain't no way I'm doing any better.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.043
Besides, her dad is Dave.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.503
Of Dave's Donuts.

13:14.587 --> 13:16.213
I gotta lock it down.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.607
You know, I might be interested in her.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.844
Man, I just said I was gonna propose.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.221
No, interested in the truck.

13:25.598 --> 13:27.838
I'll bring it by here tomorrow
if you wanna check it out.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.685
Yeah, sweet.

13:29.768 --> 13:33.689
Hey, Billy... tomorrow,
Dave's donuts are on me.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.023
I get 'em for free.

13:35.107 --> 13:36.609
Not anymore.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.876
[chewing] Oh, yeah, that works.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.170
What's up, man? You making beercakes?

13:57.254 --> 13:59.382
[continues chewing] Nope. Beer cereal.

13:59.465 --> 14:01.634
[chuckles] Beerios.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.765
Hey, what did you
think of Billy's truck?

14:07.848 --> 14:09.099
Piece of crap.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.685
I know, right? We should buy it.

14:12.936 --> 14:13.979
You kidding me?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.939
I'm not wasting my bonus
money on that thing.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.441
Plus, he's asking too much for it.

14:17.525 --> 14:20.211
Billy's one of our best friends. We
can totally take advantage of him.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.070
Dude, forget it.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.448
All right, come on, man.
You gotta go in on this.

14:24.532 --> 14:26.343
Remember how much we loved
that truck in high school?

14:26.367 --> 14:28.619
Remember how much people
loved you in high school?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.328
Some things don't age well.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.724
Dude, come on. We... we
can use it on the ranch.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.667
Plus... [stammers] we're grown-ass men.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.990
We need a truck so we're free
to come and go as we please

14:37.044 --> 14:39.422
from Daddy's house when he's mean to us.

14:40.506 --> 14:43.300
Look, dude, I don't need a
truck, all right? I got my bike.

14:43.384 --> 14:44.677
All right, fine.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.304
Guess I'll be riding on the
back of your bike forever.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.265
Would you get off my butt?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.577
No, I can't. I'm gonna be
touching your butt all the time

14:52.601 --> 14:54.269
I'm ridin' on the back of your bike.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.039
All right, it's not funny,
dude. Get off my butt.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.290
[sing-song] No, I'm touching your butt.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.356
Jesus, man.

14:58.441 --> 14:59.876
- [sing-song] I'm touching your butt!
- Come on, Colt!

14:59.900 --> 15:01.234
Get off my butt.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.074
Dad, we... we were just, uh...

15:07.157 --> 15:08.557
What you got there? [Clears throat]

15:09.785 --> 15:12.705
It's not your brother's ass.
You sure you're still interested?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.584
Broncos tickets.

15:16.667 --> 15:20.087
Ed left 'em on my windshield last night.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.798
Holy shit. Row 15?

15:22.881 --> 15:26.427
Only time I've been that close is when
I got hammered and fell from row 50.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.136
We're not goin'.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.638
What?

15:29.722 --> 15:32.641
Yeah, yeah, of course
not. Hmm, that'd be...

15:32.725 --> 15:36.103
Father and sons going football games
together, that's... that's awful.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.065
They're just a bribe to get
us to sell to Neumann's Hill.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.399
Ed wants us to sell?

15:41.484 --> 15:44.404
[laughs] He can make Colt the starting
quarterback for the Denver Broncos,

15:44.445 --> 15:45.547
we wouldn't sell this place.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.072
Damn right. [Clears throat]

15:47.155 --> 15:50.075
Does he know someone
on the coaching staff?

15:50.158 --> 15:52.327
All I need is a tryout...

15:52.410 --> 15:53.954
and a cup of someone else's urine.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.290
I appreciate your support.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.544
- I'm giving 'em back.
- Yeah, tell him we don't want 'em.

16:01.504 --> 16:02.546
[door closes]

16:02.630 --> 16:05.298
Man, Ed must be crazy if he
thinks Dad's gonna sell this place.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.550
[scoffs] Hell, yeah.

16:06.634 --> 16:09.553
[chewing] You know what? If
I was the quarterback, though,

16:09.637 --> 16:11.514
you could be my center. You know why?

16:11.597 --> 16:12.640
- Hmm?
- 'Cause I'd be...

16:12.723 --> 16:13.783
- [sing-song] touchin' your butt!
- Oh, God.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.809
- Touchin' your butt!
- Jesus, man!

16:18.562 --> 16:19.855
Dear God.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.862
Hey, Maria. Two Buds, on me.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.340
Man, how much do you
think our bar tab would be

16:29.364 --> 16:30.991
if Mom didn't own this place?

16:31.074 --> 16:33.702
$12,842.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.414
That's just for the beer.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.877
Whiskey, $8,684.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.923
You, my good man, are delightful.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.217
Thanks, Maria. Hey, there you go.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.720
- It's weird not having Mom in here.
- Yeah.

16:52.638 --> 16:53.948
Every time I walk through that door,

16:53.972 --> 16:56.433
I keep expecting to
see her behind the bar.

16:56.517 --> 16:59.394
Yeah, you know, smile when I
walk in. Hand me a free beer.

17:00.979 --> 17:04.316
I'm sure there's some other stuff,
but bottom line is I miss her.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.358
- [cell phone chimes]
- Oh. [Sighs]

17:07.277 --> 17:09.445
Oh, hey. It's a text from Billy.

17:09.530 --> 17:11.990
He's out back with the
truck. Let's go check it out.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.452
Oh, hey, Ab.

17:15.536 --> 17:16.869
Hey, Colt.

17:19.790 --> 17:21.959
Sure, I'd love to play
a song on the jukebox.

17:26.547 --> 17:30.968
What would you like to listen to?
Old Dominion's "Break Up with Him"?

17:31.051 --> 17:33.929
[chuckles] Or, Sam Hunt,
"Breaking Up in a Small Town"?

17:34.012 --> 17:35.472
- [chuckles]
- Maybe, Garth Brooks,

17:35.556 --> 17:37.349
"Did You Break Up With
Kenny Yet?" [chuckles]

17:37.432 --> 17:40.644
[scoffs] It's barely been a day.

17:40.728 --> 17:41.937
Oh, sorry.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.481
No pressure.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.109
So, uh, you wanna make out?

17:47.651 --> 17:48.902
No!

17:48.986 --> 17:50.904
Don't like Taylor Swift.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.157
Okay, now that's suspicious.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.533
Everybody likes T-Swizzle.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.871
Listen, I'm gonna talk to
Kenny. I just need some time.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.623
You haven't told anyone, have you?

18:00.706 --> 18:02.457
- No, of course not.
- All right, good.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.084
Hey, Rooster.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.754
- Oh, hey, Abby. So...
- Hey.

18:08.839 --> 18:09.965
What's new?

18:10.048 --> 18:11.174
Damn it, Colt!

18:11.258 --> 18:13.719
I didn't tell him. He
just figured it out.

18:14.595 --> 18:16.114
You say anything, I'm
telling the whole town

18:16.138 --> 18:17.448
you peed your bed until you were 14.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.307
Damn it, Colt!

18:19.391 --> 18:21.351
I didn't tell her. She
just figured it out.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.645
Damn, man.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.359
Oh, shit, you got a CB radio?

18:29.442 --> 18:32.613
Breaker one-nine, Breaker one-nine,
anybody got eyes on Smokey?

18:32.696 --> 18:34.489
This is Colt 45.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.366
[Rooster] Plug wires are all cracked.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.869
Headers look about
rusted straight through.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.328
Needs a new fan belt.

18:40.412 --> 18:41.914
- [horn blares]
- [grunts]

18:43.749 --> 18:44.750
We'll take it.

18:45.751 --> 18:48.545
Colt, if you want this junker so
bad, you have to buy her by yourself.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.588
- What?
- [sighs]

18:50.673 --> 18:51.715
All right, look, Billy...

18:51.799 --> 18:53.550
you know I love this truck.

18:53.634 --> 18:55.218
My brother here is not too fond of it,

18:55.302 --> 18:56.780
so you're gonna have to
cut a little off the price.

18:56.804 --> 18:59.723
Dude, you give it away for
free, I still don't want it.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.183
- Four thousand.
- Zero.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.426
- Thirty-five hundred.
- Zero.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.601
- Three grand.
- Zero.

19:03.686 --> 19:05.454
Guys! I need at least
five grand for the ring!

19:05.478 --> 19:06.521
Damn it.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.899
Ring? Are you serious?

19:08.982 --> 19:11.902
Are you... proposing?

19:13.028 --> 19:15.572
I guess. In the worst way ever.

19:15.656 --> 19:17.449
Oh, my God, yes!

19:17.532 --> 19:18.867
[sighs] I love you!

19:18.951 --> 19:20.344
- [Rooster laughs]
- [Colt] Whoa-ho!

19:20.368 --> 19:22.370
Congratulations, man.

19:22.454 --> 19:25.457
Hey, hey, let's take her out for a
celebratory test drive, huh? Keys.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.168
Hang on, Colt. First blow in this.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.921
[blowing]

19:32.715 --> 19:34.007
Rooster, you're driving.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.345
[Latin music playing on stereo]

19:40.055 --> 19:41.639
Hey, what are we listening to?

19:41.724 --> 19:43.641
I got this stereo at a garage sale.

19:43.726 --> 19:45.728
The CD is just stuck in there.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.022
It kinda grows on you.

19:49.106 --> 19:50.440
<i>Me gusta.</i>

19:52.234 --> 19:54.695
[singing in Spanish]

20:07.958 --> 20:09.752
So, what do you guys think?

20:10.668 --> 20:13.421
Plus, we could throw in a
siren that you can put on top.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.423
Oh, hell, yeah!

20:16.591 --> 20:20.678
Breaker, Breaker, this is Colt
45. They just threw in a gumball.

20:20.763 --> 20:22.848
See? This car is awesome.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.017
All the warning lights are on.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.476
And, dude, we're out of gas.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.897
Oh, the... the fuel gauge is
broken. Don't worry about that.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.151
So how do you know
when you're out of gas?

20:35.068 --> 20:36.486
It stops.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.366
Oh... oh, think about how much fun

20:41.449 --> 20:42.802
- we could have in this truck.
- [Rooster sighs]

20:42.826 --> 20:44.536
It's like high school
all over again, man.

20:44.619 --> 20:47.372
We can go to the drive-in. We
can go back to the Four Corners.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.458
Oh, hey, hey. Let's take her down
to the lake bed and go muddin'.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.878
Hell, no, dude. Lake
bed's like 30 miles away.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.797
[scoffs] No problem.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.317
- Rooster, put the hammer down.
- [siren wailing]

20:58.341 --> 21:00.969
[laughs] Billy, give me your gun.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.474
[indistinct cheering]

21:12.689 --> 21:15.400
[laughing] This is awesome!

21:15.483 --> 21:17.027
We are so buying this truck!

21:17.110 --> 21:18.695
Yeah, boy! Get some! Get some!

21:19.654 --> 21:22.282
Yeah, make it dirty! Make it dirty!

21:26.161 --> 21:29.289
Dude, that muddin' was badass.
I'm not even pissed we got stuck.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.415
Yeah.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.544
It's funny how you suddenly got unstuck
as soon as I got behind that back tire.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.130
- [chuckles]
- Oh, hey, hey.

21:37.214 --> 21:38.548
Hey, what's goin' on, Ed?

21:38.631 --> 21:39.757
Hey, Rooster.

21:41.259 --> 21:44.512
- Wow, you are a mess.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.764
[chuckles] But still better
looking than your brother.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.851
Oh, that's debatable.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.854
Hey, Maria. Uh, can we get
two of what Ed's drinkin'?

21:51.937 --> 21:53.146
That's $23.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.233
$23 of money?

21:57.234 --> 21:59.194
Yeah, we'll just take two Buds.

21:59.277 --> 22:01.029
No, no, no, no. Get two more.

22:01.113 --> 22:02.906
Maria, put it on my tab, please.

22:02.990 --> 22:05.200
Maria, but... [stammers]
still get the two Buds.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.162
Put a rush on it. That's for you.

22:09.246 --> 22:10.538
[chuckles]

22:11.623 --> 22:14.792
Hey, did you really think
my dad was gonna sell to you?

22:14.877 --> 22:17.146
I tell you, I considered it a
win when I walked out of there

22:17.170 --> 22:19.422
without an ass full
of buckshot. [Chuckles]

22:19.506 --> 22:20.507
[chuckles]

22:20.590 --> 22:21.734
You guys can't keep coming around here

22:21.758 --> 22:23.903
trying to push people out of
their family business, you know?

22:23.927 --> 22:26.846
You really think I would walk
into the home of an old friend

22:26.930 --> 22:28.306
and take advantage of him?

22:28.390 --> 22:30.225
That's not what we do.

22:30.308 --> 22:33.061
You know what? I appreciate that.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.063
This is for you.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.734
Uh... thank you for the dollar.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.365
Yeah, I'm, uh, running
a little low. [Chuckles]

22:48.326 --> 22:50.787
So... what does Neumann's Hill do?

22:50.870 --> 22:54.541
Neumann's Hill offers a fair
and equitable partnership

22:54.624 --> 22:57.377
with emphasis on a sustainable...

22:59.922 --> 23:01.506
Uh, let me explain it with beer.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.052
How much did this beer cost you?

23:05.135 --> 23:07.304
Well, it used to be free.
Now it's like three bucks.

23:08.096 --> 23:09.514
Miss you, Mom.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.891
Let's say you sell beer.

23:11.975 --> 23:14.019
You buy it for two and
you sell it for three.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.521
Boom. Just doubled my money.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.987
Yeah, well, sometimes

23:24.071 --> 23:26.448
everybody wants a beer, and
you can sell it for four.

23:26.531 --> 23:27.991
Yeah, well, that's good.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.326
But then there's times

23:29.409 --> 23:31.954
when nobody wants a beer, and
you can only sell it for a buck.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.331
So?

23:34.414 --> 23:36.791
We got a shit-ton of
beer. We just drink it all.

23:38.335 --> 23:40.045
The beers are cows.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.505
- [Colt and Rooster] Oh.
- Ooh.

23:43.506 --> 23:47.885
Our company buys your beer cows every
year for three bucks, no matter what.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.263
You never have to
worry about ups or downs

23:50.347 --> 23:53.266
and you're guaranteed a good
living for the rest of the year.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.312
Well, that doesn't sound half bad.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.773
I don't know, whatever. It's Dad's call.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.359
Yeah, but someday, fellas...

24:03.151 --> 24:05.778
and I hope it ain't no time
soon, it's gonna be your call.

24:07.322 --> 24:08.924
Ed, I cannot tell you
how refreshing it is

24:08.948 --> 24:10.468
to be talked to like an
adult once in a while.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.701
- [chuckles]
- [Colt] Yeah.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.579
I'mma go out back and hose
the mud out of my ass crack.

24:14.662 --> 24:15.982
Then we're gonna talk about this.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.085
[siren wailing]

24:24.339 --> 24:27.050
- [Colt in sing-song] Ah-ha! Ah-ha!
- [tapping on truck]

24:27.134 --> 24:29.302
- [chuckles]
- Check it out, Dad. Bought a truck.

24:29.386 --> 24:30.720
- [door slams]
- Great.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.348
Now you don't need the
one I was gonna get you.

24:34.682 --> 24:35.808
You serious?

24:35.892 --> 24:38.603
- Ah, he's kiddin', right?
- Yeah, he's kiddin'.

24:38.686 --> 24:39.729
You kiddin'?

24:41.606 --> 24:44.401
Yeah, you know me. I'm a real jokester.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.570
- Damn it, Colt!
- Hey, Dad. [Clears throat]

24:47.654 --> 24:48.988
Listen, we, uh...

24:49.906 --> 24:51.699
ran into Ed down at the bar.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.661
He told us about that
deal he offered you.

24:54.744 --> 24:57.080
And we're thinkin'...
it kind of makes sense.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.206
Stop.

24:58.873 --> 25:02.169
We're not selling the
ranch. End of discussion.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.729
Yeah, well, that's the
thing. It's not selling...

25:03.753 --> 25:04.796
Stop.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.132
Let me simplify this a little bit.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.343
Imagine we've got a herd of beer cows...

25:12.095 --> 25:13.305
Stop.

25:14.264 --> 25:16.266
Look, Dad...

25:16.349 --> 25:18.143
it actually makes a lot of sense, right?

25:18.226 --> 25:21.771
Like, if we partner with Neumann's
Hill, we never have to struggle again.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.856
We never have to turn off the power.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.275
I mean, we didn't have TV.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.045
Remember that night we were
all playing <i>Battleship</i>

25:27.069 --> 25:28.653
and Colt was sharing his feelings?

25:29.571 --> 25:31.739
That was the worst
fucking night of my life.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.160
I remember that.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.744
You sunk my self-esteem.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.458
This way, we get to keep
doin' what we love doin'

25:40.498 --> 25:42.084
and make a good livin' while doin' it.

25:42.167 --> 25:43.727
Yeah, like you said...
[stammers] we're partners,

25:43.751 --> 25:46.088
so maybe we ought to be
a part of this decision.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.799
When I said partner, I
meant silent partners.

25:51.301 --> 25:54.262
As in... the next time
you have an opinion,

25:54.346 --> 25:58.225
you can shove it up your brother's
ass you seem to be so fond of.

26:01.353 --> 26:04.522
Dad, whether you like it or not,
this is gonna be our ranch someday.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.608
Yeah, and hopefully that
day is a long way away.

26:06.691 --> 26:08.091
But you know, you're getting old...

26:08.860 --> 26:10.778
ah than you were last week, you know.

26:13.115 --> 26:16.534
So the day after I call you partners,
you're telling me to sell the ranch?

26:16.618 --> 26:18.495
- No, it's not selling, Dad!
- [Rooster sighs]

26:18.578 --> 26:20.389
If you weren't so stubborn,
maybe you could see that.

26:20.413 --> 26:24.167
Look, Dad, I've been working side
by side with you for 15 years,

26:24.251 --> 26:25.728
you still treat me like a hired hand.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.044
So here's what we're doin'.

26:27.129 --> 26:29.631
Ed's gonna come up here, he's
gonna pitch us all the deal,

26:29.714 --> 26:31.007
and then we'll decide together.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.468
Really?

26:33.551 --> 26:34.886
Is that what we're gonna do?

26:40.057 --> 26:41.100
Whoa.

26:41.184 --> 26:43.784
I always thought Dad was gonna
die first, but now it might be you.

26:45.313 --> 26:47.583
I don't care. About time I
told him he's not always right.

26:47.607 --> 26:48.650
Hell, yeah.

26:49.609 --> 26:50.902
We're adults.

26:50.985 --> 26:52.612
It's about time he starts respecting us.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.365
Oh, shit, here he comes,
and he's got a weapon.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.246
I've busted my ass for 50
years as an independent rancher.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.873
There are good years
and there are lean years.

27:03.956 --> 27:08.085
But the one thing you can always hang
your hat on is you work for yourself.

27:08.170 --> 27:11.088
Dad, we don't work for
ourselves. We work for you.

27:11.173 --> 27:12.215
That's right.

27:12.299 --> 27:14.217
And one day this place will be yours.

27:14.301 --> 27:16.093
And that's what this is all about.

27:17.387 --> 27:21.057
If we sell out to Neumann's Hill,
they'll put their brand on our cows.

27:21.140 --> 27:25.395
And this, which my dad gave
to me, and I will give to you,

27:25.478 --> 27:28.565
will be nothing but a
useless piece of fuckin' iron.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.444
If you can't see the problem with that,

27:32.527 --> 27:35.905
then I did an even worse job
raising you two than I thought.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.455
Dad, we barely made
it through this time.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.458
What if we have another bad year?

27:51.296 --> 27:54.466
Screw this. I'm gonna go see
if Abby broke up with Kenny yet.

27:55.758 --> 27:58.386
All right. Drop me off at
Mary's on the way, would you?

28:00.680 --> 28:02.765
I mean, just 'cause we
don't agree with him,

28:02.849 --> 28:05.602
doesn't mean we don't give
a shit about this ranch.

28:08.813 --> 28:10.064
I don't even know why we care.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.649
He don't listen to us anyway.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.043
When's he gonna take us seriously?

28:13.067 --> 28:16.363
We are mature adults, and we're
capable of making good decisions.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.114
[engine sputtering]

28:22.201 --> 28:24.036
[sputtering continues]

28:29.876 --> 28:31.544
Can't let Dad find out.

28:31.628 --> 28:34.046
Help me push this piece
of shit into a lake.

28:35.632 --> 28:36.674
Damn it!

28:51.105 --> 28:53.107
