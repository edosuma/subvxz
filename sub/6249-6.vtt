<i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>

00:04.904 --> 00:07.839
<i>[Man] Smoke comes out of the vent</i>
<i>into the first-floor break room.</i>

00:07.941 --> 00:10.102
You're sure you turned
the flame down last night?

00:10.210 --> 00:13.043
Totally, 100% guaranteed,
positively sure.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.943
Alarm's gone off before,
but the smoke was always gray.

00:16.049 --> 00:19.712
Well, one time, a possum got caught in the shaft.
Smoke came out like this.

00:19.819 --> 00:23.220
Dr. Addy was conducting
an experiment on a pig yesterday.

00:23.323 --> 00:27.851
I told all them eggheads not to toss
dead animals down the incinerator shaft.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.929
Since when do they listen to us?

00:31.965 --> 00:35.332
- <i>[Flames Roaring]</i>
- Holy crap. [Coughs]

00:35.435 --> 00:37.733
Definitely not pork.

<i>At 400 degrees, bone chars in six hours</i>
<i>and turns to ash in eight.</i>

00:52.619 --> 00:56.612
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>Charring, no ash. Six to eight hours?</i>

00:56.723 --> 01:01.023
- Dumped into the incinerator
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.
- [Groans]

01:01.127 --> 01:03.687
<i>Was that alive or dead before</i>
<i>he or she went into the incinerator?</i>

01:03.797 --> 01:06.265
- Can't tell yet.
- What's that?

01:06.366 --> 01:10.826
Guest log. No visitors checked out
after 9:36 last night.

01:10.937 --> 01:14.270
No one checked in
before 8:02 this morning.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.467
Meaning the victim probably works here.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.272
Meaning the killer does too.

01:22.315 --> 01:24.283
Pubic bone. Female.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.978
There's no carbon in the trachea.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.113
She was dead before
she was thrown down the chute.

01:30.223 --> 01:33.556
Extensive fissures, fractures
and breaks to the entire skeleton.

01:33.660 --> 01:37.756
I'll have Zack determine which were
caused by heat and which by trauma.

01:37.864 --> 01:42.324
Heads up. They called Bancroft in
from a hearing on the Hill.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.632
- Who's Bancroft again?
- God.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.899
The supreme honcho of theJeffersonian.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.975
I think I met him once.

01:50.076 --> 01:53.068
Okay. I am ready to start
the facial reconstruction.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.909
I haven't put on
tissue depth markers yet.

01:56.015 --> 01:58.745
I haven't finished removing
all the carbonized brain matter.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.616
<i>[Brennan] Once you've done that,</i>
<i>Zack can clean the skull.</i>

02:10.562 --> 02:13.191
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Angela? Angela?</i>

02:13.299 --> 02:15.699
- Angela.
- Yeah.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.362
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong?

02:19.873 --> 02:22.637
Um-

02:22.742 --> 02:25.870
Um, I'm fine.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.107
Uh, I'll- I'll start after
the tissue markers are-

02:31.718 --> 02:34.084
Let me know.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.350
What the hell was that about?

03:17.297 --> 03:20.289
- You won't like it.
- Like what?

03:20.400 --> 03:23.995
- I've I.D.'d the victim.
- That's impossible.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.196
I told you you wouldn't like it.

03:26.306 --> 03:29.332
There are no tissue markers. You can't
just look at a skull and see the person.

03:29.442 --> 03:34.243
Sweetie, I've done hundreds
of these reconstructions.

03:34.347 --> 03:38.841
The depressed glabella, the narrow nasal
aperture, the chipped lateral incisor.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.113
You can see a face from that?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.884
The chipped tooth was from
a skiing accident when she was 16.

03:44.991 --> 03:48.688
Ange.
You know the victim personally?

03:48.795 --> 03:51.025
[Sighs]

03:52.131 --> 03:54.964
Kristen Reardon.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.560
She's an intern.
We had coffee a couple of times.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.798
<i>She didn't want to be a scientist.</i>

04:00.907 --> 04:04.638
She wanted to go into design.
She was just here to make her father happy.

04:04.744 --> 04:09.579
She was young and eager and keen and-

04:11.050 --> 04:13.814
She was just really, really young.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.387
<i>Wait. Reardon?</i>

04:16.488 --> 04:18.548
As in Dr. Ted Reardon?

04:18.658 --> 04:22.116
- Yeah. He used to work here.
- I took a course from him
in Ancient Pharmacology.

04:22.228 --> 04:25.493
<i>Look, I know that we can't say anything</i>
<i>until you do the tissue markers...</i>

04:25.598 --> 04:28.931
and we go through channels, but I'm
telling you I know that this is Kristen.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.162
Poor Ted.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.330
You want to know something else?

04:33.439 --> 04:37.273
- She was seeing somebody who worked here.
- Is that relevant?

04:37.377 --> 04:41.245
Well, Booth will think so,
especially since it was a married man.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.781
Well, did she tell you who?

04:43.883 --> 04:48.320
No. Just that they had had their first kiss
at the opening of that Egyptian exhibit...

04:48.421 --> 04:50.787
<i>and that it had been</i>
<i>hot and heavy ever since.</i>

04:50.890 --> 04:54.382
- I'm sorry, Ange.
- No, I'm- I'm sorry.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.860
I'm just really freaked out by this one.

04:56.963 --> 05:01.491
- Because you know the victim.
- Well, and the killer. I mean, look around.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.866
<i>Do you like thinking</i>
<i>that somebody we see every day...</i>

05:04.971 --> 05:07.701
could've thrown Kristen
into the incinerator?

05:12.111 --> 05:14.136
Now, how can I aid your investigation?

05:14.247 --> 05:17.842
<i>Well, Dr. Bancroft, I'd like printouts</i>
<i>from theJeffersonian Security...</i>

05:17.950 --> 05:21.716
detailing who was and was not
in the building.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.550
Done.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.784
I'd also appreciate it if you would tell
your people to cooperate with the F.B.I.

05:26.893 --> 05:29.088
Yes, of course, Agent Booth.

05:29.195 --> 05:32.460
I don't know if you've had much cause
to work with scientists.

05:32.565 --> 05:35.363
Difficult people by nature.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.834
Combative, skeptical, resistant.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.529
I've noticed.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.903
Have you identified the victim yet?

05:42.008 --> 05:45.205
Unofficially, an intern
by the name of Kristen Reardon.

05:45.311 --> 05:48.803
- No relation to Ted Reardon?
- His daughter.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.742
Dr. Reardon left theJeffersonian
for Georgetown University?

05:53.853 --> 05:57.050
In the interest of full disclosure,
I was instrumental in that move.

05:57.156 --> 06:00.489
- You fired him?
- I facilitated a necessary change.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.584
Necessary change?

06:02.695 --> 06:05.163
Excellent scientist, poor administrator.
Does Reardon know about his daughter?

06:05.264 --> 06:07.061
Dr. Brennan is informing him now.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.259
I'd like to be kept in the loop on this.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.497
- Within the constraint of the law, of course.
- [Chuckles]

06:12.605 --> 06:14.505
Sure.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.235
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>Ted Reardon? Victim's father?</i>

06:17.343 --> 06:21.109
<i>Yep. Bones is telling him</i>
<i>his daughter's dead.</i>

06:21.214 --> 06:24.047
<i>[Saroyan] Rumor has it Bancroft</i>
<i>banished Reardon from theJeffersonian...</i>

06:24.150 --> 06:26.277
<i>'cause he felt threatened politically.</i>

06:26.386 --> 06:29.082
<i>I know. Let's leave Bones to it.</i>

06:31.624 --> 06:35.993
Would it be insensitive to mention that
my father's 60th birthday's coming up?

06:36.095 --> 06:38.063
- Sixty already? Wow.
- Uh-huh.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.462
We're having a big birthday dinner
for him on Thursday night.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.466
You give him my best.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.662
- You do it yourself. You have to come with me.
- What? No. Not your family.

06:45.772 --> 06:49.208
No. I can't spend the night defending the fact
that I still live alone to my family.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.276
You never told them we broke up?

06:51.377 --> 06:53.572
You want to make a man miserable
on his 60th birthday?

06:53.679 --> 06:55.772
You want me to pretend
that I'm your boyfriend?

06:55.882 --> 06:58.316
- Yes. Between 6:30 and 10:00 on Thursday.
- <i>[Groans]</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:02.479
Camille, you're an adult. You can't live your life
afraid of what your family thinks.

07:02.588 --> 07:06.285
Seeley, it's not gonna be like this forever.
One day he'll die.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.559
Tough going in there?

07:10.663 --> 07:13.223
I've never had to tell someone
his child is dead.

07:13.332 --> 07:16.995
I mean, I've been there when you did it,
but to actually-

07:17.103 --> 07:19.833
It's extremely unpleasant.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.464
Yeah.

07:22.575 --> 07:26.773
Listen, did you get a chance to, uh,
ask him about his daughter's love life?

07:26.879 --> 07:29.848
Yes. He said as far as he knew,
she wasrt seeing anyone.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.144
Kristen was lying to her father.

07:32.251 --> 07:34.446
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Dr. Brennan, is it true?</i>

07:34.554 --> 07:36.579
Kristen Reardon is dead?

07:36.689 --> 07:40.352
Evan, Special Agent Booth.
He's in charge of the murder investigation.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.224
Dr. Evan Klimkew,
Kristen Reardors supervisor.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.388
Murder? Kristen was murdered?

07:45.498 --> 07:49.195
- What does Kristen Reardon do?
- Authentications.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.931
Other museums and high-end collectors use us
to authenticate their acquisitions.

07:53.039 --> 07:56.031
- Is that a big department?
- Three to five interns, all doctoral candidates.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.110
My assistant and myself. That's it.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.612
- Hmm. That's a competitive environment, right?
- Of course.

08:01.714 --> 08:05.377
You put a bunch of neurotic,
type "A" overachievers together,
dangle a prize over their head-

08:05.485 --> 08:08.318
Dr. Klimkew is referring
to the Bates Fellowship.

08:08.421 --> 08:12.551
The top intern receives $75,000 and a gold star
on their rÃ©sumÃ©. Kristen was the front-runner.

08:12.658 --> 08:17.095
- I had heard that her heart wasrt in it.
- Didrt show in her work.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.824
God, this is terrible.
Do- Does her father know?

08:19.932 --> 08:22.457
<i>Who's the main rival</i>
<i>for the Bates money?</i>

08:22.568 --> 08:24.126
Uh, that would be Neil Tyler.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.364
Neil Tyler. Where can I find him?

08:26.472 --> 08:30.636
We're authenticating the artifacts
in your serial killer vault.

08:30.743 --> 08:34.110
So, what does your wife think of these,
you know- these late hours?

08:34.212 --> 08:36.340
I'm separated. That's your answer.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.714
- You seeing anyone now?
- Are you serious?

08:39.818 --> 08:41.480
It's a murder investigation, Evan.

08:41.587 --> 08:44.351
No. I'm not seeing anyone.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.017
Thank you, Dr. Klimkew.

08:52.198 --> 08:56.498
This spinner appears to be Masonic in origin.
Bloodstone gold.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.264
But what's interesting is, in the center...

08:59.372 --> 09:03.672
instead of the traditional "G" for God,
there's a skull.

09:06.012 --> 09:08.310
- Gormogon iconography.
- Strange, huh?

09:08.414 --> 09:10.609
We've been seeing a lot of that in here.

09:10.716 --> 09:14.174
- Gormogon? Okay, what's that?
- It's an 18th-century-

09:14.287 --> 09:17.552
<i>It's an extinct group dedicated</i>
<i>to eradicating the influence...</i>

09:17.657 --> 09:22.026
of the Freemasons and Illuminati
in Europe in the 18th century.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.722
<i>That could be the largest collection</i>
<i>of Gormogon artifacts in the world.</i>

09:24.830 --> 09:27.298
That's great. You and Kristen Reardon
were here last night?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.369
That's right. Kristen worked there.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.562
I signed out around midnight.

09:32.672 --> 09:35.038
Kristen stayed longer, like always.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.109
Okay. Little resentful there?

09:38.177 --> 09:40.145
I worked my way through state college.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.010
I've got a second job,
which is why I had to leave early.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.743
Kristen went to an Ivy League school.
Her dad's got connections.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.785
Who do you think needed
that Bates Fellowship more?

09:47.887 --> 09:51.721
Well, the way I hear it, you're next
in line for the big payday, pal.

09:51.824 --> 09:53.985
[Scoffs]
I liked Kristen. She liked me.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.221
Check the logs. I wasrt here.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.298
Do you know who Kristen was seeing?

09:59.398 --> 10:02.856
You mean, like, romantically?
No. Only that it was an older guy.

10:02.969 --> 10:06.166
And she said I was gonna be really surprised
when I found out who it was.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.900
- How 'bout you? You married?
- [Laughs]

10:09.008 --> 10:10.942
I'm gay, Agent Booth.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.943
Excuse me.

10:17.016 --> 10:20.508
- What do you got?
- Kristen Reardors bag.

10:21.587 --> 10:24.147
<i>Ah, cell phone.</i>

10:25.391 --> 10:27.450
Logs.

10:29.795 --> 10:33.754
<i>The bag tells us that Kristen wasrt leaving</i>
<i>the museum when she met with her killer.</i>

10:33.866 --> 10:36.334
- Look at that. A lot of calls to the same number.
- Booth.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.403
Let's hope it's our cheating husband.

10:38.504 --> 10:40.802
Kristen was authenticating artifacts
from the Gormogon vault.

10:40.906 --> 10:44.273
- Let's not go there.
- If Gormogon killed her,
then Gormogon is one of us.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.107
- Somebody who works at theJeffersonian.
- Oh. You went there.

10:47.213 --> 10:50.979
- What?
- You went there, and you gave him a nickname.

10:51.083 --> 10:55.179
- <i>[Crash]</i>
- That just happened, right? You saw that?

10:56.088 --> 10:58.056
[Siren Wails]

11:00.459 --> 11:02.689
- Who is it?
- Is he dead?

11:02.795 --> 11:06.094
- Yes, but only because he was never alive.
- You gotta be kidding me.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.599
[Hodgins] Look at this. The Gestapo
is interfering with free inquiry.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.569
Guys, just let 'em go.
And if they try to escape, shoot 'em!

11:12.672 --> 11:15.038
- What's with the dummy, dummies?
- Not a dummy.

11:15.141 --> 11:18.110
It's an ersatz skeleton
made from glass and reinforced nylon...

11:18.210 --> 11:20.235
which breaks exactly like human bones.

11:20.346 --> 11:24.339
- We threw it from the top floor.
- Explicate your process, please.

11:24.450 --> 11:28.181
Using bone density tables, we duplicated
Kristers exact height and weight.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.187
For God's sake, why?

11:30.289 --> 11:34.055
To prove Kristen was dead before her skull
fractured from falling down the incinerator shaft.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.492
- We already know that.
- We recreated her bone density...

11:36.595 --> 11:39.462
and found that her skull would not
have fractured in the way it did...

11:39.565 --> 11:41.692
from a fall less than 25 meters.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.395
- Oh.
- "Oh" what? English, please!

11:44.503 --> 11:48.405
That tells us the body was put in the trash chute
on the top floor of our building.

11:48.507 --> 11:51.237
The office suites.
It's always the suits, baby.

11:51.343 --> 11:55.370
- Hey, I wear suits.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

11:55.481 --> 11:58.245
All right. That's it.
No shooting of the squints tonight. Sorry.

11:58.350 --> 12:01.376
All right. Good work. Let's go, Bones.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.614
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>Kristen Reardon was stabbed to death.</i>

12:04.724 --> 12:08.182
- Aorta and left lung both punctured.
- Whoa. She bleed a lot?

12:08.294 --> 12:12.094
Through the wounds. Through her mouth.
Copious amounts.

12:12.198 --> 12:15.429
Booth, everyone's coming around to
the opinion that Kristen Reardors death...

12:15.534 --> 12:17.502
had something to do
with the Gormogon vault.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.833
Oh, no, no, no.
See, we gotta squelch that one...

12:19.939 --> 12:22.464
'cause that will totally shift
the focus of this investigation.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.442
You might have noticed,
but these people are tough to squelch.

12:25.544 --> 12:28.308
You know what? They're always
telling us not to jump to conclusions.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.440
- But when they do, it's called a quantum leap.
- <i>Jump, leap.</i>

12:31.550 --> 12:33.450
Tomato, to-mah-to.
What's the difference?

12:33.552 --> 12:36.487
Look, um, does the name Aldridge
mean anything to you?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.250
It rings a bell, yeah. Why?

12:38.357 --> 12:41.884
Because there was no blood near
the incinerator chute on the top floor.

12:41.994 --> 12:44.724
The body could've been wrapped in plastic
or transported in a tub.

12:44.830 --> 12:48.163
<i>There's a Dr. Kyle Aldridge.</i>
<i>Heads up the Middle East department. Why?</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:50.394
Hmm.
Do they have offices in this building?

12:50.503 --> 12:52.801
Middle East department
is in Building "S"...

12:52.905 --> 12:55.237
but it joins up to this building
by a skyway. Why?

12:55.341 --> 12:58.071
- What floor does the skyway connect with?
- Top floor.

12:58.177 --> 13:00.441
I'm gonna ask why again,
and this time you're gonna tell me.

13:00.546 --> 13:03.242
This guy Aldridge's number's
all over Kristers cell phone.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.613
- <i>[Cell Phone Beeping]</i>
- Just hold on. Yeah, it's Booth.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.448
Check out all the offices
in the adjoining building on the top floor.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.988
Start with a Dr. K. Aldridge.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.451
- Cam, this case-
- Yes. You still have to come to
my father's birthday dinner.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.758
I didn't even bring that up.
I'm just saying-

13:19.865 --> 13:21.355
- Nice try.
- "Nice try" what?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.957
- Zip.
- I didn't even-

13:23.068 --> 13:25.866
Zoop!

13:25.971 --> 13:28.303
Ah, the good life.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.773
Dr. Kyle Aldridge.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.344
Mansion next to Teddy Kennedy
on Dupont Circle?

13:33.445 --> 13:38.849
A 60-foot yacht and a vacation home
in the Hamptons. Wow.

13:40.786 --> 13:44.483
I wish I'd paid more attention
during science class.

13:44.590 --> 13:47.559
Intelligence is not
a matter of will, Agent Booth.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.686
So it's not a character flaw to be
less intelligent than someone else.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.855
Yeah. Listen.
I appreciate the pep talk.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.399
Listen. Our first suspect
would usually be your wife.

13:55.501 --> 13:59.835
But since she's been in Venice
for a month-Venice?

13:59.939 --> 14:04.069
So how is it that somebody
who makes 80 grand a year...

14:04.176 --> 14:06.406
can lend Ted Kennedy his lawn mower...

14:06.512 --> 14:09.310
and afford to send his wife
off to Venice?

14:09.415 --> 14:11.679
My wife's family is very generous.

14:11.784 --> 14:15.220
How generous do you think they would be
if they found out that you were, uh...

14:15.321 --> 14:17.687
boinking an intern?

14:17.790 --> 14:20.258
They teach you that technique
at Quantico?

14:20.359 --> 14:25.058
Spring vulgarities on the unsuspecting suspect
and he will confess all?

14:25.164 --> 14:27.496
Are you confessing all?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.501
To the affair or to murder?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.161
<i>Excuse me, Agent Booth.</i>

14:32.271 --> 14:36.401
There's something you're gonna
want to see in Dr. Aldridge's workroom.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.408
[Man]
Lights, please.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.183
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Wow. Look at all that blood.</i>

14:45.284 --> 14:49.118
<i>This can't explains how the body was</i>
<i>transported over to the incinerator chute.</i>

14:58.464 --> 15:01.433
<i>This must be where Kristen Reardon</i>
<i>was actually murdered.</i>

15:01.533 --> 15:03.592
All right. Put the lights on.

15:03.702 --> 15:09.038
Okay, Dr. Aldridge. I'd like to ask you a few
questions about the murder of Kristen Reardon.

15:09.141 --> 15:11.837
We gonna go willingly?

15:20.019 --> 15:22.453
I never liked Kyle Aldridge.

15:22.554 --> 15:26.217
He told me once that having a high I.Q.
Was no excuse not to bathe.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.987
- I don't believe it.
- No. Those were his exact words.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.062
"No excuse not to bathe."

15:31.163 --> 15:35.759
- What do you got?
- Consistent with the trauma
to the left lung and aorta.

15:35.868 --> 15:40.066
The C7 vertebrae and the fifth rib
were both nicked at a 67-degree angle...

15:40.172 --> 15:42.538
suggesting a single point of entry.

15:42.641 --> 15:46.577
- Through the back?
- The serial killer eats human flesh.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.944
- Kyle Aldridge is a vegetarian.
- So was Hitler.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.812
We're calling him Gormogon now.

15:51.917 --> 15:54.750
Excellent name.
And historically accurate.

15:54.853 --> 15:58.687
People, you have to stop assuming that
Gormogon was involved in Kristers death.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.158
Why? It's somewhere between
a possibility and a probability.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.456
Kyle Aldridge is not a cannibal.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.929
But he may have killed his girlfriend.
Do you see the difference?

16:07.032 --> 16:09.125
- Mmm.
- So eyes on the evidence, okay?

16:09.234 --> 16:11.134
[Claps Hands]
Go.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.636
Zack provided me with the fragments.

16:13.739 --> 16:16.207
Retrieved from the fifth rib.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.209
- <i>[Hodgins] Running it through the G.C. Mass spec.</i>
- What about the incinerator?

16:19.311 --> 16:23.941
I analyzed the ashes in the incinerator and
found carbonized traces of <i>Cedrus libani.</i>

16:24.049 --> 16:26.483
It's a species of cedar fir from Lebanon.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.917
<i>The Middle East</i>
<i>is Aldridge's area of study.</i>

16:29.021 --> 16:33.287
<i>And the Mesopotamians used cedar</i>
<i>as an odor neutralizer during funerals...</i>

16:33.392 --> 16:35.860
to mask the smell of burning flesh.

16:35.961 --> 16:39.089
Can you see Aldridge
committing a crime of passion...

16:39.198 --> 16:41.166
and using his knowledge to cover it up?

16:41.266 --> 16:44.497
I guess. He's kind of-

16:45.671 --> 16:49.163
[Grumbling, Growling]

16:49.274 --> 16:52.004
Exactly how well do you know Aldridge?

16:52.111 --> 16:54.477
We had drinks.
I don't sleep with married men.

16:54.580 --> 16:58.038
<i>You're married. And you sleep</i>
<i>with men besides your husband.</i>

16:58.150 --> 17:00.050
What's the difference?

17:00.152 --> 17:01.983
Ow!

17:04.455 --> 17:07.185
Why do you want me
to interrogate Aldridge?

17:07.291 --> 17:09.521
- Because he thinks I'm stupid.
- You're not.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.596
Thanks, Bones. I know.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.325
During the interrogation,
always refer to the victim by her first name.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.958
Well, you're the one that told me
that personalizing the victim...

17:17.069 --> 17:19.037
doesn't work
with sociopathic serial killers.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.106
They lack all empathy.
You told me that.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.571
Look, we are not looking
for Gorgonzola today.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.405
Gormogon. Gor-mo-gon.

17:26.512 --> 17:29.970
We're looking for someone who murdered one girl
and tossed her down an incinerator chute.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.209
Entirely different kind of a guy.
So inside.

17:32.317 --> 17:35.753
Don't tell me- Don't-
You're not bossing me. Stop it.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.360
Kyle Aldridge seduced my daughter?

17:42.461 --> 17:44.952
That's what we hope to find out, Doc.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.294
<i>It was definitely Kristers blood</i>
<i>on your worktable.</i>

17:47.399 --> 17:51.392
That proves only she was killed in my workroom.
Why am I talking to you?

17:51.503 --> 17:54.370
What time did you leave
theJeffersonian that night?

17:54.473 --> 17:56.703
Shortly after 11:00.

17:56.809 --> 18:00.905
Dr. Brennan, surely I merit
someone higher up the food chain...

18:01.013 --> 18:03.277
than an F.B.I. Consultant.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.651
Kyle, I know
you get everything you want...

18:07.753 --> 18:09.983
by flaunting your superior intellect...

18:10.089 --> 18:12.057
but that won't work with me.

18:12.157 --> 18:16.787
- Why is that?
- Because I'm smarter than you are.

18:16.895 --> 18:21.195
<i>So why don't we do the rational thing</i>
<i>and cut to the chase?</i>

18:21.300 --> 18:23.928
Were you having an affair with Kristen?

18:24.970 --> 18:26.835
I'm not willing to comment on that.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.964
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Again, I know you were.</i>

18:29.074 --> 18:32.271
You first kissed at the opening
of the Egyptian exhibit.

18:35.347 --> 18:38.316
Obviously Kristen was indiscreet.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.352
<i>[Brennan] If your wife knew</i>
<i>about Kristen, she'd leave you, correct?</i>

18:41.453 --> 18:43.421
And you'd no longer be rich.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.460
See, the F.B.I., they call that a motive.

18:49.561 --> 18:52.029
<i>They think you did this, Dr. Aldridge.</i>

18:52.131 --> 18:55.259
And so far the evidence is on their side.

18:56.602 --> 19:00.197
<i>Can you tell me anything</i>
<i>that would suggest otherwise?</i>

19:02.207 --> 19:04.368
Yes.

19:04.476 --> 19:08.037
But first I need to speak with a lawyer and
make arrangements with a federal prosecutor.

19:08.147 --> 19:12.379
- Sounds like you want to cut a deal.
- I've told you what I need.

19:12.484 --> 19:17.319
So either have me arrested,
or let me make those arrangements.

19:25.931 --> 19:26.920
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.157
Cam. Cam.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.394
Wow! You look great.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.699
I mean that objectively,
not as your fake boyfriend.

19:33.805 --> 19:37.571
- Thank you.
- Hey, got your dad a universal remote.

19:37.676 --> 19:41.168
- Even bought the batteries.
- Oh, he'll never let us break up.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.010
- So, am I driving?
- No. My sister's picking us up.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.085
- But, of course, she's late.
- Okay, maybe she's late because there was traffic.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.154
Maybe she's late 'cause there was a sale.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.552
Oh, great.
It's gonna be one of those nights.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.182
Hey, it's not me.
She's the jealous, competitive one.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.193
- [Chuckles] Okay.
- You don't think so?

19:56.295 --> 19:58.263
Look, I'm thinking it's your family.

19:58.363 --> 20:02.459
I am an innocent bystander
with a universal remote and batteries...

20:02.568 --> 20:04.536
trying not to get hit by shrapnel.

20:04.636 --> 20:08.333
- That's all.
- Ready. Sorry. Dad is in the car.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.932
- [Both] Mwah. Mwah.
- Okay. Let me get my things.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.172
[Sighs] There was traffic.
Not that she'd believe me.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.842
No. Traffic. That's exactly what she said.
This is gonna be fun.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.080
Yeah. Everyone talking about
how perfect Cam's life is.

20:23.188 --> 20:26.180
No. Cam's life is not so perfect.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.953
You got a lot going for you.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.461
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.896
What's not so great?
Are you and Cam-

20:35.000 --> 20:37.059
What?

20:37.169 --> 20:41.367
- No. No. I should never have said anything.
- Oh, you poor baby.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.907
[Moans]

20:44.009 --> 20:45.909
Okay, Felicia.

20:46.011 --> 20:49.970
You don't have to say anything.
I'm here. That's all you need to know.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.852
Okay. Let's go.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.547
Let's go! Yeah, okay. You look great.

20:57.656 --> 21:00.124
Doesrt she look beautiful?
She looks beautiful! God!

21:00.225 --> 21:02.250
I am so lucky to have you
as my girlfriend.

21:02.361 --> 21:06.422
- Go easy, big guy. It's gonna be all night.
- Oh, tell me about it.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.502
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>You know, Jack.</i>

21:12.604 --> 21:15.903
You are actually a better candidate
to be Gormogon...

21:16.008 --> 21:17.908
than Kyle Aldridge.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.137
- Really?
- Mmm.

21:20.245 --> 21:25.012
You're brilliant, paranoid about conspiracies.
I say that lovingly.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.551
With limitless resources.

21:27.653 --> 21:32.113
I'm not Gormogon.
I don't kill people and eat their faces.

21:32.224 --> 21:35.955
- Mm-hmm.
- I am not waging a secret war against anybody.

21:39.998 --> 21:43.832
Great. Now if I can only get the other thousand
or so people who work here to convince me...

21:43.935 --> 21:45.869
maybe I can sleep tonight.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.166
Oh, I'll help you get to sleep tonight.

21:48.273 --> 21:51.674
[Laughs]
What's in your file?

21:51.777 --> 21:56.180
G.C. Mass spec analysis of the fragment
we pulled from Kristers rib.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.408
It's, uh, 800-year-old copper.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.883
Wait, wait.
The murder weapon is an artifact?

22:00.986 --> 22:05.787
Well, I thought we'd see if we can match any of
the weapons in theJeffersonian to the sample.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.792
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>Well, there is one item.</i>

22:08.894 --> 22:12.455
An 800-year-old copper spear tip.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.725
The Authentication department
checked it out two weeks ago...

22:14.833 --> 22:17.301
<i>to a... Dr. Kyle Aldridge...</i>

22:17.402 --> 22:19.666
in the Middle Eastern department.

22:19.771 --> 22:21.739
Checked it out from where?

22:24.176 --> 22:26.144
The Gormogon vault.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.584
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Tell us about this piece, Dr. Klimkew.</i>

22:33.685 --> 22:36.483
<i>The spearhead is genuine, decorative.</i>

22:36.588 --> 22:39.056
Probably brought back
as a souvenir of the Crusades...

22:39.157 --> 22:42.092
by a Templar Knight
in 1200 or 1300 A.D.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.822
- Go ahead, Hodgins.
- What are you doing?

22:44.930 --> 22:48.593
Did you see Kyle Aldridge the night
that Kristen Reardon was murdered?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.668
Yes. What is he doing
with the spearhead?

22:50.769 --> 22:53.704
It's phenolphthalein.
It won't affect the copper.

22:53.805 --> 22:56.831
But if blood is present, it'll turn pink.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.773
So what time did you see the doctor?

22:58.877 --> 23:02.836
- Uh, 11:00, in the parking lot.
- Did you talk?

23:02.948 --> 23:07.544
Kyle Aldridge doesn't really talk to anyone
beneath him, which is everyone.

23:12.190 --> 23:14.249
It's not the weapon we're looking for.

23:14.359 --> 23:16.327
I'll put it back.

23:17.529 --> 23:19.554
Did you know about Aldridge and Kristen?

23:19.664 --> 23:21.757
As a couple? Yes.

23:21.867 --> 23:24.961
- Kristen told you?
- No. I caught them making out.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.970
Frankly,
I've been surprised ever since...

23:27.072 --> 23:29.404
that Aldridge didn't use his friendship
with Bancroft to have me transferred...

23:29.508 --> 23:31.408
to some dig in Darfur.

23:31.510 --> 23:34.308
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>Helpl I need some help back herel</i>

23:34.413 --> 23:37.109
- What? Oh, oh, oh, oh. All right. Hold on.
- <i>Booth.</i>

23:37.215 --> 23:39.115
- Hold on. Hold on.
- [Grunts]

23:41.086 --> 23:43.054
Hold on.
[Grunts]

23:46.191 --> 23:47.783
<i>Easy. Easy, easy, easy.</i>

23:49.895 --> 23:52.455
- All right. I'll call an ambulance.
- We don't need an ambulance.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.998
He's already dead.

24:06.578 --> 24:08.876
That concludes the autopsy
of Dr. Kyle Aldridge.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.948
Written report to follow.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.949
<i>Booth saw Aldridge's widow.</i>

24:13.051 --> 24:15.576
He sent her a suicide note by e-mail...

24:15.687 --> 24:18.019
apologizing for the affair with Kristen...

24:18.123 --> 24:20.091
and confessing to the killing.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.524
Aldridge did not kill himself.

24:22.627 --> 24:26.529
The ligature, which was a silk cord
from the vault, didn't break his hyoid.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.690
- What was the cause of death?
- <i>I'm stumped.</i>

24:28.800 --> 24:33.032
No significant trauma, no cardiac arrest,
aneurysm or hematoma.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.106
<i>Plus, I did a full tox screen.</i>

24:35.207 --> 24:39.507
Organics, inorganics, heavy metals,
even cardiac glycosides- all negative.

24:39.611 --> 24:41.636
Well, he was hung up in the vault.

24:41.746 --> 24:44.044
It all circles back to the vault.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.242
It all circles back to
the Authentications department...

24:46.351 --> 24:48.319
who happened to be working in the vault.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.787
Why don't you and Booth think
that Gormogon is behind these murders?

24:51.890 --> 24:55.621
Because as far as we know,
he only kills males and snacks on them.

24:55.727 --> 24:59.527
- Plus, there are far too many
other reasonable suspects.
- Like who?

24:59.631 --> 25:02.122
- The victim's father.
- Ted Reardon?

25:02.234 --> 25:05.226
He saw you question Aldridge.
Booth said he went pale with anger.

25:05.337 --> 25:10.741
- When did he say that?
- We had dinner the other night
when we... had dinner.

25:10.842 --> 25:14.209
<i>This cord is actually</i>
<i>a hanging rope from England...</i>

25:14.312 --> 25:16.712
circa 1650.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.783
In those days,
when sentenced to death...

25:18.884 --> 25:22.047
nobles often chose a silk cord
rather than rough hemp and rope.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.678
It'd be cool to know who else
might've died on this cord.

25:24.789 --> 25:28.486
If it came from the vault, the cord
probably can't lead us to the murderer.

25:28.593 --> 25:31.687
Au contraire <i>. The killer left D.N.A.</i>

25:31.796 --> 25:37.564
In order to hoist Aldridge, the killer wrapped
the cord around his forearm and pulled.

25:37.669 --> 25:40.433
Ouch.
He left some skin behind?

25:40.539 --> 25:43.406
- Yeah. And hair.
- <i>Nice job, Hodgins.</i>

25:43.508 --> 25:45.874
We find the guy,
we can do a D.N.A. Match.

25:45.977 --> 25:47.945
King of the lab.

25:48.046 --> 25:53.450
The skeletal muscles are pulling away
from the bone. What's his potassium level?

25:53.552 --> 25:56.783
Uh, blood serum contains...

25:56.888 --> 25:59.049
<i>10 milligrams per 100 milliliters.</i>

25:59.157 --> 26:01.057
Elevated, but nonfatal.

26:01.159 --> 26:03.423
<i>It's odd though,</i>
<i>because his kidneys were healthy.</i>

26:03.528 --> 26:05.962
No signs of Addisors or any medication.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.362
- Succinylcholine.
- A muscle relaxant?

26:08.466 --> 26:10.730
<i>In high doses,</i>
<i>it stops the heart and lungs.</i>

26:10.835 --> 26:14.965
Right. The body turns
succinylcholine into potassium...

26:15.073 --> 26:18.941
which occurs naturally in the body,
so it's not detected as a toxin.

26:19.044 --> 26:23.174
Succinylcholine is one of
the earliest anesthetics known to man.

26:23.281 --> 26:26.910
- Guess how I know that.
- I read Dr. Reardors book too.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.961
Why are you here?

26:40.131 --> 26:42.929
I'm just waiting for Cam
to finish cutting up Aldridge.

26:43.034 --> 26:46.800
She's done.
Why are you here in my area?

26:46.905 --> 26:48.930
Cam's sister kissed me.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.907
- Dude.
- Don't call me dude. All right, listen.

26:52.010 --> 26:55.707
I was supposed to be Cam's boyfriend,
but only between the hours of 6:30 and 10:00.

26:55.814 --> 26:59.272
She kissed me at 6:20,
so technically that doesn't even count.

26:59.384 --> 27:02.012
- [Scoffs]
- Cam went to her office to get something.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.748
Felicia, she just grabbed me
and planted one on me.

27:04.856 --> 27:07.654
I didn't even see it coming.
I didn't even have a defense maneuver planned.

27:07.759 --> 27:10.023
Oh, wow. All right, all right.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.427
Uh, how are you, uh-
How are you gonna break it to Cam?

27:13.531 --> 27:16.864
- What? Why would I do that?
- You want her to find out from her sister?

27:18.436 --> 27:20.836
Wow. This is worse
than when we were a couple.

27:20.939 --> 27:23.703
[Laughing]
Sorry.

27:23.808 --> 27:27.972
- [Laughing Continues]
- I really should take my gun out
and shoot you now.

27:28.079 --> 27:30.274
I'm sorry, man. No, it's... serious.

27:30.382 --> 27:33.818
- [Giggling]
- You're not helping.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.685
Look, I have a son. If I thought someone
hurt him, I'd want to hang him.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.691
I didn't kill Kyle Aldridge.

27:41.793 --> 27:44.091
He was a political enemy
who slept with your daughter...

27:44.195 --> 27:47.722
then killed her
after she threatened to tell his wife.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.823
Juries understand situations like that.

27:49.934 --> 27:53.062
- There's no proof
Kyle Aldridge killed my daughter.
- Do you need proof?

27:53.171 --> 27:56.470
Yes. And for a jury to be sympathetic to me,
they'd need proof as well.

27:56.574 --> 27:58.906
Do you have that proof, Agent Booth?

27:59.010 --> 28:01.205
Aldridge didn't die from hanging.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.714
Succinylcholine poisoning
can't be proven.

28:05.817 --> 28:09.378
Right.
Nobody knows that better than you.

28:09.487 --> 28:11.978
You literally wrote the book on it, Doc.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.058
So...

28:15.093 --> 28:17.527
can you roll up your sleeves, please?

28:30.275 --> 28:32.869
<i>This is a sample of 800-year-old bronze.</i>

28:32.977 --> 28:34.911
Why am I interested in that?

28:35.013 --> 28:37.948
Because we found a fragment
of 800-year-old copper in Kristen Reardon.

28:38.049 --> 28:41.177
- Different metals. Right.
- Copper is an ingredient in bronze.

28:41.286 --> 28:44.881
And when Angela accused me
of being Gormogon, it started me thinking.

28:44.989 --> 28:46.957
Angela accused you of being Gormogon?

28:47.058 --> 28:51.017
It started me thinking
that you and Booth could be right.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.861
I am not Gormogon.

28:55.967 --> 28:58.367
Booth and I could be right about what?

28:58.470 --> 29:01.234
I put the serial killer in the vault
out of my mind...

29:01.339 --> 29:04.706
and started considering Kristers murder
as its own singular occurrence.

29:04.809 --> 29:06.436
What?

29:06.544 --> 29:09.809
From the outside, you are a pretty good
candidate to be Gormogon.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.541
It's possible...

29:11.649 --> 29:13.617
that the copper in Kristers wound...

29:13.718 --> 29:16.243
was an unalloyed chip
from a larger piece of bronze...

29:16.354 --> 29:18.822
like a chocolate chip
that didn't melt in the cake mix.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.982
And theJeffersoniars
full of bronze weapons.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.788
None of which are in Gormogors vault.

29:23.895 --> 29:27.023
Are you able to match a bronze weapon
to a copper fragment?

29:27.132 --> 29:29.157
Theoretically, but it would
take about 200 years...

29:29.267 --> 29:31.235
to test every bronze weapon
in theJeffersonian.

29:31.336 --> 29:33.770
I might be able to help with that.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.897
<i>I worked up a 3-D model of Kristers murder,</i>
<i>and I noticed something.</i>

29:38.009 --> 29:39.909
This is Kristen.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.311
The angle of attack
was exactly 67 degrees.

29:45.416 --> 29:48.852
- As you can see,
the weapon went right through her.
- Which is weird.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.513
- Why?
- We've been assuming that Kristen was stabbed.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.683
Someone would have to be awfully tall
to stab downward at that angle.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.593
And incredibly strong.
6'8" and 300 pounds.

29:58.696 --> 30:01.358
<i>No one at theJeffersonian</i>
<i>looks like that.</i>

30:01.466 --> 30:05.129
- It'd be pretty tough
for someone like that to sneak in.
- Alternative explanations?

30:05.236 --> 30:07.431
Projectile?

30:07.539 --> 30:10.804
Blood stain analysis indicates Kristen
was killed on Aldridge's worktable.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.309
And there's no evidence on the surface
suggesting that a projectile...

30:13.411 --> 30:15.845
exited Kristers body
and struck the table.

30:15.947 --> 30:18.381
But-

30:22.787 --> 30:26.689
Kristen was impaled?
Like a piece of paper on a message spike.

30:26.791 --> 30:30.022
<i>Visualize a sharp object on the table...</i>

30:30.128 --> 30:32.221
at a fixed 67-degree angle.

30:32.330 --> 30:36.027
The object impales Kristen
through the posterior thorax.

30:36.134 --> 30:39.968
- Exits her anterior thorax.
- Still at a 67-degree angle.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.869
The only rational conclusion
is the death itself was accidental.

30:45.376 --> 30:48.140
Dr. Aldridge gets in a tiff
with his young girlfriend.

30:48.246 --> 30:51.374
She pulls out her phone,
threatens to call his wife.

30:51.482 --> 30:53.973
<i>They argue.</i>
<i>Aldridge reaches for the phone.</i>

30:54.085 --> 30:56.519
The girl falls back onto the table.

30:56.621 --> 31:00.523
If you call Aldridge by his name,
you really should call "the girl" by her name.

31:00.625 --> 31:05.528
At which point, he panics and throws
Ms. Reardon down the incinerator chute.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.758
Overcome with remorse, he arranges
to meet with the federal attorney to confess.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.098
<i>But before he can do that,</i>
<i>guilt destroys him.</i>

31:12.203 --> 31:16.162
<i>He hangs himself in the vault, symbolically</i>
<i>aligning himself with the serial killer.</i>

31:16.274 --> 31:19.835
Whoa, Dr. Bancroft. Aldridge arranged
to meet the federal attorney?

31:19.944 --> 31:23.345
Through theJeffersonian in-house counsel.
Most likely to confess.

31:23.448 --> 31:26.781
Why didn't he just confess
during Dr. Brennars interrogation?

31:26.885 --> 31:30.616
"The guilt being great,
the fear doth still exceed.

31:30.722 --> 31:34.021
"And extreme fear
can neither fight nor fly...

31:34.125 --> 31:36.685
but coward-like
with trembling terror, die."

31:36.794 --> 31:38.625
Unfortunately for Mr. Shakespeare...

31:38.730 --> 31:41.324
Dr. Aldridge
didn't actually commit suicide.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.627
He died of succinylcholine poison.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.899
It's my understanding that that can't be proven,
at least not to court standards.

31:48.006 --> 31:52.705
No, I think you'll find that my explanation
will satisfy any inquest inquiry.

31:52.810 --> 31:56.405
Dr. Bancroft, it's our professional opinion
here in the forensics lab...

31:56.514 --> 31:58.414
that Dr. Aldridge was murdered.

31:58.516 --> 32:00.450
Fine. Prove it.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.246
But watch your backs...

32:02.353 --> 32:04.651
<i>because if I'm wrong</i>
<i>and you're right...</i>

32:04.756 --> 32:07.054
that means there's still
a serial killer out there.

32:07.158 --> 32:10.252
And if I were the killer, you'd be next,
Miss Montenegro.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.090
Why me?

32:12.196 --> 32:14.426
Well, you identified the Reardon girl.

32:14.532 --> 32:18.161
You figured out this hologramatic
impalement scenario.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.237
Well, be careful.

32:25.910 --> 32:27.844
I feel like I was just threatened.

32:39.590 --> 32:43.583
I've checked every bronze weapon in the
Jeffersonian that matches Angela's criteria.

32:43.695 --> 32:47.426
None are consistent with the fragment
removed from Kristen.

32:47.532 --> 32:50.296
Well, obviously we're looking
for a weapon that was smuggled in.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.926
- [Scoffs]
- Yeah? Well, hey. What were those noises?

32:53.037 --> 32:57.303
There is no way to smuggle an 800-year-old
bronze weapon into theJeffersonian.

32:57.408 --> 33:00.809
No. No. We have X-rays,
guards, metal detectors.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.779
You come in with anything bigger
than a watch, they search you.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.849
You two are geniuses.
How would you do it?

33:05.950 --> 33:08.680
- It's absolutely impossible.
- Unless you mail it.

33:08.786 --> 33:11.550
Oh. Yeah, right. There's that.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.250
- What?
- If you mail something to theJeffersonian...

33:14.359 --> 33:16.657
it doesn't need to be cleared
by Customs or Security.

33:16.761 --> 33:20.629
Okay. You're saying if I want to get
a stolen artifact into the United States...

33:20.732 --> 33:23.701
all I have to do
is mail it to theJeffersonian?

33:23.801 --> 33:27.794
Technically, yes, but the fact is we check
and report all items to the government.

33:27.905 --> 33:31.170
- Okay. Who's "we?"
- The Authentications department.

33:31.275 --> 33:35.974
Oh, okay. You mean a bunch of starving interns
who work here during the summer.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.811
Interns keep detailed records
of every item they authenticate.

33:39.917 --> 33:41.908
Access Kristen Reardors log.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.217
I suppose Gormogon could've
mailed himself to theJeffersonian...

33:45.323 --> 33:47.450
stole an I.D. And simply walked out.

33:47.558 --> 33:49.753
- This has got nothing to do with "Goobagon."
- Gormogon!

33:49.861 --> 33:53.490
- Whatever. How many times do I have to say that?
- [Beeping]

33:53.598 --> 33:56.328
I don't have the necessary clearance.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.334
Let me try.

34:00.138 --> 34:02.629
- [Beeping]
- Neither do I.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.867
Excuse me.

34:04.976 --> 34:07.444
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Wait. You have a password?</i>

34:07.545 --> 34:09.775
Yeah. Cam's.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.940
- What? She won't mind.
- [Laughs]

34:12.050 --> 34:13.949
[Beeping]

34:14.052 --> 34:18.181
Kristen Reardon worked on a lot
of 16th-century baroque wood carvings.

34:19.891 --> 34:23.382
I know your password too.
It's "daffodil."

34:23.494 --> 34:25.962
- I never told you that.
- What? I got eyes.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.054
I mean, you guys
aren't exactly C.I.A. Material.

34:28.166 --> 34:31.431
- Daffodil?
- What? They're pretty.

34:31.536 --> 34:35.199
<i>It looks like Kristen might have worked</i>
<i>on some Luristan Bronzes.</i>

34:35.306 --> 34:38.070
Any from the 13th century?

34:38.176 --> 34:40.974
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>Yeah. Tools, utensils, sculptures.</i>

34:41.079 --> 34:43.411
- What's Luristan?
- Persia.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.608
You mean Iran or Iraq. Since
the war, Iraqi museums have been looted...

34:46.717 --> 34:50.083
and their pieces are being sold
on the black market.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.588
This murder has nothing to do
with the vault or a serial killer.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.658
So Kristen Reardon was a smuggler?

34:54.759 --> 34:56.556
More than likely killed by a smuggler.

34:56.661 --> 35:00.392
- She goes to report something,
and the smuggler kills her.
- Yeah.

35:00.498 --> 35:03.763
<i>I'll have Zack check all of these</i>
<i>as possible murder weapons...</i>

35:03.868 --> 35:06.063
and I'm changing my password.

35:08.372 --> 35:11.273
- Daisy?
- How did you know?

35:11.375 --> 35:14.742
It's your second-favorite flower.
I know you, Bones. Try a planet.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.682
[Snaps Fingers]
Jupiter!

35:26.624 --> 35:28.524
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.526
- I owe you.
- No, you don't.

35:30.628 --> 35:33.256
I do. Took the pressure off.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.389
I even reconnected with Felicia.

35:37.435 --> 35:39.369
- She kissed me.
- What?

35:39.470 --> 35:42.837
I swear I didn't see it coming.
She just planted it on me.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.807
Like a peck on the cheek
or a full meal?

35:45.910 --> 35:48.208
Why does that even matter?

35:48.312 --> 35:51.145
Full meal.

35:51.249 --> 35:53.217
- I don't believe it.
- What's the big deal?

35:53.317 --> 35:55.547
I mean, you and I aren't actually,
you know, going out.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.850
She thought she stole you away from me.
That's why she was so nice.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.319
- You.
- What?

36:02.426 --> 36:05.327
- You kissed back.
- No, no.

36:05.429 --> 36:08.990
No, there was no kiss back.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.467
You know, my lips, they may
have parted for a second-

36:12.570 --> 36:15.004
- <i>Hi. Ready for lunch?</i>
- Hi.

36:15.106 --> 36:18.872
Don't say hello to her. How could you
make a move on my boyfriend?

36:18.976 --> 36:21.410
He said things werert so great
between you guys.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.537
You didn't think
you should ask me first?

36:23.648 --> 36:25.741
Sorry. Didrt seem like
he was all that into you.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.842
Time out.
Let's get real here, okay?

36:28.953 --> 36:32.650
- You are fighting over something
that does not even exist.
- What?

36:32.757 --> 36:35.590
We don't go out anymore.
We broke up a long time ago.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.923
And you brought him for Dad
so he'd still think-

36:38.029 --> 36:42.159
You know Dad. I'd never hear the end of it.
You saw how he lit up when he got that remote.

36:42.266 --> 36:44.666
- It can handle up to eight different devices.
- <i>We know, Booth.</i>

36:44.769 --> 36:46.760
Why didn't you tell me you guys split up?

36:46.871 --> 36:48.736
You want him? Take him. I don't care.

36:48.839 --> 36:51.330
- I don't want him.
- You don't?

36:51.442 --> 36:54.673
I was just trying to get back at you
for being so perfect all the time.

36:54.779 --> 36:57.077
- So you admit it?
- Like you're a saint?

36:57.181 --> 36:59.274
She used to go into my closet
with all my dolls...

36:59.383 --> 37:01.578
and say they were having a party,
but I wasrt invited.

37:01.686 --> 37:03.779
You were five,
and they did not like you.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.856
Typical!
Start a fight so we miss lunch.

37:05.957 --> 37:09.950
<i>You made reservations? I thought we'd</i>
<i>have to eat from a can't in the street.</i>

37:10.061 --> 37:13.895
- Wow. You two can have lunch after all this?
- Like you can ruin a meal?

37:13.998 --> 37:16.466
- [Felicia Scoffs]
- Okay, that's it. I don't know who you think-

37:16.567 --> 37:18.694
Don't raise your voice to her, Seeley.

37:20.538 --> 37:22.062
What?

37:22.173 --> 37:24.733
Let's go. Let him calm down.

37:24.842 --> 37:28.710
- Wow.
- Why did you guys break up? What did he do?

37:29.914 --> 37:32.144
It wasrt me. L-

37:32.316 --> 37:35.945
- [Beeping]
- This is the most likely murder weapon.

37:36.053 --> 37:38.613
- It's an antelope.
- Actually, it's an oryx.

37:38.723 --> 37:41.590
- That's a type of antelope.
- I was being precise.

37:41.692 --> 37:44.286
You used to appreciate that.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.897
- <i>Sixty-seven degrees.</i>
- <i>Exactly.</i>

37:49.000 --> 37:51.992
Oryx on table, struggle,
Kristen Reardon is impaled on the oryx.

37:52.103 --> 37:56.665
Good work, Zack! Let's swab the sculpture,
see if there's any D.N.A. Evidence.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.401
It's not here.

37:58.509 --> 38:01.000
<i>[Bancroft]</i>
<i>What do you mean it's not here anymore?</i>

38:01.112 --> 38:03.012
According toJeffersonian records...

38:03.114 --> 38:07.414
the oryx was mailed to Box 99,
Poplar Street Post Office in Arlington.

38:07.518 --> 38:12.319
What? TheJeffersoniars being used
to smuggle Iraqi artifacts?

38:12.423 --> 38:15.415
- Has the F.B.I. Been informed about this?
- Yes, Dr. Bancroft.

38:15.526 --> 38:19.462
Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan are trying to arrange
to have the post office staked out tomorrow.

38:19.563 --> 38:23.021
Good. Good. That's good.

38:26.504 --> 38:29.871
- <i>[Cell Phone Beeping]</i>
- It's Cam.

38:29.974 --> 38:35.002
<i>I told him. You were right. He wasrt happy</i>
<i>when I said the F.B.I. Already knew.</i>

38:35.112 --> 38:39.776
Thanks. Now we'll see if he's a part of it
or just another ass-covering bureaucrat.

38:39.884 --> 38:41.681
Good hunting.

38:41.786 --> 38:45.813
Hmm. Little game there, Bones.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.891
Who shows up for the Iraqi Bambi?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.983
There are a number of possible candidates.

38:50.094 --> 38:53.291
Come on. I mean, it's a stakeout.
Play with me. Speculate.

38:56.967 --> 39:00.130
- My money's on Bancroft.
- What? The head of theJeffersonian? Why?

39:00.237 --> 39:02.398
- He's a dill weed.
- [Scoffs]

39:02.506 --> 39:06.465
- You think he's a murderer
just because you don't like him?
- Bones, it's a game.

39:08.512 --> 39:12.209
Well, there's no way it's Bancroft.
He has a doctorate.

39:12.316 --> 39:14.784
Dr. Kevorkian has a doctorate.

39:18.823 --> 39:22.350
<i>Whoa. So does that guy.</i>

39:22.460 --> 39:24.519
Dr. Klimkew.

39:26.964 --> 39:30.866
During a murder investigation,
you uncovered my smuggling operation?

39:30.968 --> 39:34.233
- Yep.
- Man, that is bad, bad luck.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.772
What about the murders, Evan?

39:36.874 --> 39:39.001
Kristen Reardon and Kyle Aldridge?

39:39.110 --> 39:41.442
No, I'm afraid
that their deaths are on your hands.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.570
How do you figure?

39:43.681 --> 39:47.447
Well, this silver skeleton Gormogon
serial killer is obviously involved.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.416
<i>You brought him into our house.</i>

39:49.520 --> 39:53.047
No. I can only take responsibility for
smuggling this oryx into the country.

39:53.157 --> 39:55.887
Get your hands off the murder weapon.

39:58.662 --> 40:01.597
We know what happened.

40:04.468 --> 40:08.234
I was there, but it wasrt me
who pushed Kristen onto that table.

40:08.339 --> 40:12.139
- It was Aldridge.
- Now, why would he do that?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.143
<i>Uh, love gone wrong? I don't know.</i>

40:14.245 --> 40:17.510
But Aldridge said that if I didn't
help him dispose of the body...

40:17.615 --> 40:20.243
he'd expose my smuggling deal
and I would go to prison.

40:20.351 --> 40:22.979
Well, I guess that's it then, huh, Bones?
Case closed.

40:23.087 --> 40:27.581
<i>Right. Well, except somebody</i>
<i>killed Kyle Aldridge.</i>

40:27.691 --> 40:30.489
No, he hanged himself. Ow!

40:30.594 --> 40:33.791
Yeah. Rope burns. Look at that.

40:33.898 --> 40:37.231
Well, we think you killed Kristen Reardon
probably by accident.

40:37.334 --> 40:40.735
- We know you killed Kyle Aldridge.
- Premeditated.

40:40.838 --> 40:44.433
<i>And I'm confident we can prove it</i>
<i>beyond reasonable doubt to a jury.</i>

40:44.542 --> 40:47.375
- Ow!
- It's over, Evan.

40:47.478 --> 40:49.378
[Slaps Arm]

40:52.249 --> 40:54.274
Do either of you know a good lawyer?

41:01.325 --> 41:03.293
Okay, don't take it so hard.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.760
I'm not taking anything hard.
What are we? Russian?

41:05.863 --> 41:08.661
Ah! <i>Na Zdorov'yel</i> Yeah.

41:08.766 --> 41:11.496
Mmm.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.263
I'll tell you what else I know.

41:13.370 --> 41:15.634
What you're taking hard...

41:15.739 --> 41:19.004
is, uh, the fact
that it happened in your house.

41:19.109 --> 41:22.545
- It's not my house.
- Not where you sleep.

41:22.646 --> 41:27.481
The-Your favorite place.
The house of reason. TheJeffersonian.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.985
Oh. It's not my favorite place.

41:30.087 --> 41:33.716
- Yes, it is.
- What? No, it's not- How do you know?

41:33.824 --> 41:36.486
Daffodil, daisy...

41:36.594 --> 41:38.391
<i>Jupiter.</i>

41:38.496 --> 41:41.124
Okay, I'll tell you what else I know.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.365
You were hoping that it was Gorgonzola.

41:49.573 --> 41:52.508
- Gormogon.
- Ah! So you admit it!

41:52.610 --> 41:55.101
Uh- [Sighs] Accidentally.

41:55.212 --> 41:58.579
- Does- Does that count?
- Yes.

41:58.682 --> 42:01.150
<i>Look, all the scientists</i>
<i>and the squints and the eggheads...</i>

42:01.252 --> 42:04.915
they wanted it to be a serial killer
so it wouldn't be one of them.

42:05.022 --> 42:06.683
- "Them"?
- You.

42:06.790 --> 42:09.350
- Me?
- <i>One of you.</i>

42:09.460 --> 42:11.519
You were all offended
that it was one of you.

42:14.765 --> 42:17.757
You know what?

42:17.868 --> 42:20.234
- I am offended.
- I just said that.

42:20.337 --> 42:24.000
I'm offended because-

42:27.177 --> 42:29.077
because-

42:29.179 --> 42:31.875
Because you were betrayed
by one of your own.

42:33.317 --> 42:35.751
Yes.

42:35.853 --> 42:38.287
Are you going to betray me?

42:42.526 --> 42:44.517
No.

42:47.131 --> 42:49.759
Nonetheless, I shall be vigilant.

42:53.203 --> 42:57.333
"Nonetheless"?
[Laughing]

42:57.441 --> 43:00.069
I'm not gonna have
a headache tomorrow, am I?

43:00.177 --> 43:02.077
Well, we're gonna find out.

43:02.179 --> 43:06.240
Hodgins and Zack, they do their experiments.
We do ours.

43:06.350 --> 43:08.250
To Gorgonzola!

43:08.352 --> 43:10.252
Gormogon.

43:12.156 --> 43:14.522
You missed.
[Laughing]

43:48.192 --> 43:49.523
What's that mean?
