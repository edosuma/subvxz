What happened to your face?

24:27.978 --> 24:29.458
Dark butter.

24:32.690 --> 24:36.140
She always listening?
Too damn smart for her own good.

24:36.340 --> 24:39.189
The preschool said we should think about
starting her in school early.

24:39.389 --> 24:40.389
Phina tell you that?

24:42.576 --> 24:44.408
Yeah, we're gonna put her in private school.

24:47.264 --> 24:48.825
Uniforms...

24:49.025 --> 24:53.236
I was lookin at St. Bede the other day.
It's this other school that starts them off learning Spanish,

24:53.436 --> 24:56.340
and they back going on English -
- I'm not coming to see you anymore.

24:56.540 --> 24:57.540
What?

24:59.430 --> 25:03.533
I'm not coming here, to these visits anymore.
This is the last time.

25:04.373 --> 25:06.101
I know I know I know. This is my last time too.
I told you that.

25:06.301 --> 25:08.835
I ain't goin down no more.
- You want to keep putting Sophina through this...

25:08.930 --> 25:11.340

25:11.540 --> 25:12.623
But Tatiana,

25:13.533 --> 25:14.800
that baby doesn't deserve this, Oscar.

25:14.883 --> 25:16.938
She don't know what's going on.

25:17.138 --> 25:21.894
So, I guess that's why she asked me
why you love taking your vacations more than being with her.

25:22.094 --> 25:23.094
She aint say that.

25:23.294 --> 25:25.342
Oh, So I'm the liar now.

25:29.576 --> 25:30.944
Ma you gotta tell her that I love her.

25:32.963 --> 25:35.741
Tell her, I ain't gonna leave her.
- Tell her yourself!

25:35.941 --> 25:37.608
The Next time you call home you tell her yourself.

25:37.730 --> 25:39.628
Or better yet, let her come visit you here.

25:46.466 --> 25:49.108
She don't need to be exposed.
- You've already exposed--!

25:49.963 --> 25:52.373
You've already exposed her to this.
- So, you gonna leave me?

25:53.203 --> 25:54.804
You gonna leave me again, What kinda mom is you?

25:55.293 --> 25:56.727
You wanna fuck around and leave me in here?

25:57.723 --> 25:59.190
You ain't never have my fuckin' back anyway.

26:04.893 --> 26:06.433
I'm being here by myself.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.197
I love you Oscar..
I do.

26:14.397 --> 26:16.629
And, I'm praying for you.

26:19.593 --> 26:20.713

26:23.023 --> 26:24.403

27:50.823 --> 27:53.840

27:54.040 --> 27:57.035

29:19.853 --> 29:21.463
Why you didn't get ice cream?

29:21.963 --> 29:25.303
Cause it aint your birthday.

29:26.453 --> 29:29.425
You know it would be hella easier
if you just had your stuff at my spot right.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.573
When you gonna move in.

29:32.963 --> 29:35.433
Maybe, when you stop having trees
in the car before we pick up T.

29:46.214 --> 29:48.502
Can you roll down the window, please?

30:32.811 --> 30:35.172
Hey T. T, come here.

30:44.783 --> 30:47.624

32:09.168 --> 32:13.455
But what's the difference between watching
six kids or watching seven kids?

32:23.509 --> 32:26.076
<i>Quieres pasar la noche con sus primos?
- Si, si.</i>

32:31.147 --> 32:34.003
Daddy, what's that on your shirt?

32:36.956 --> 32:38.931

32:41.155 --> 32:42.801
How's work? By the way.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.656
Being late.

34:08.382 --> 34:10.327
Missed a couple days when I had to get some money.

34:10.527 --> 34:13.121
They told you today?

34:13.322 --> 34:14.322

34:15.243 --> 34:17.723

35:29.766 --> 35:34.159
Thought I could start fresh.
But that shit aint working like that.

35:46.039 --> 35:50.160
You threw a whole zip of weed.
And you don't got a job.

35:55.955 --> 35:57.979
I could slap you right now.

36:05.771 --> 36:07.259
What are you gonna do?

36:10.354 --> 36:11.809
Something legal.

36:14.512 --> 36:17.248
Maybe if I can just not fuck up, for 30 days..

36:21.696 --> 36:24.992

My boyfriend is up there, okay.
You don't understand.

01:07:57.723 --> 01:07:59.773
You need to let me up there.

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:08.737
Wanda. I'm trying to get up,
but they are not letting me up.

01:08:08.937 --> 01:08:09.937
Oh my God!

01:08:10.137 --> 01:08:11.137
Oh my God!

01:08:11.973 --> 01:08:14.893
What did you do to him?
Did you fucking killed him?

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:16.903
What did you do to him?

01:08:24.707 --> 01:08:28.883
I need to check he's okay.

01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:32.983
Where are they taking him?

01:08:33.548 --> 01:08:35.979
Where are they taking him?

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:36.563
What's blood pressure?

01:09:36.662 --> 01:09:39.198
Was he moving his limbs?
- Yes, moving arms and legs.

01:09:39.703 --> 01:09:41.002
I'm gonna need a chest tube.

01:09:43.243 --> 01:09:45.385
We gotta get him upstairs, right away.

01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:56.024
Excuse me.

01:09:56.224 --> 01:09:59.090
My son is Oscar Julius Grant III.
He's been shot, and they told me to come here-

01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:00.223
- G-R-A..?
- -N-T. Yes.

01:10:00.423 --> 01:10:04.445
Okay, he's in surgery. Go to the ICU
and someone will be out soon.

01:10:04.645 --> 01:10:05.645
And then, where?
- Right there.

01:10:11.283 --> 01:10:12.193
Is that blood in?

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:15.947
Scissors.

01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:19.492
Suction.

01:10:53.293 --> 01:10:55.495
Hey, listen.
None of that.

01:10:55.695 --> 01:10:56.695
None of that.

01:10:56.895 --> 01:10:58.713
It's not the time or the place.

01:11:10.303 --> 01:11:11.803
Hey, we gotta keep him positive.

01:11:13.413 --> 01:11:16.252
We gotta.we gotta let these
people do their job.

01:11:16.452 --> 01:11:17.452
He's gonna be fine.

01:11:17.652 --> 01:11:20.562
Let's put all our energy toward Oscar right now.

01:11:20.762 --> 01:11:21.762
I know y'all are upset.

01:11:21.962 --> 01:11:25.715
We gotta lift him up.
Let's keep him lifted up.

01:11:27.248 --> 01:11:28.776
Let's keep him lifted up.

01:11:40.599 --> 01:11:41.585
Mrs.Johnson?
- Yes.

01:11:43.539 --> 01:11:44.731
How is he?
How is he?

01:11:44.931 --> 01:11:47.237
Mrs.Johnson, as you know..

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:48.437
Your son has been shot.

01:11:48.753 --> 01:11:50.567
We've stabilized him,

01:11:50.767 --> 01:11:51.767
but he's critical.

01:11:54.065 --> 01:11:55.161
Critical. What is that?

01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:58.999
Well, he has massive internal bleeding
and we had to remove the right lung.

01:11:59.199 --> 01:12:03.664
His lung? How is he...
How is he going to be able to breathe?

01:12:04.103 --> 01:12:06.558
He's on a breathing machine, right now.

01:12:06.758 --> 01:12:07.758
His breathing is stable.

01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:11.343
The main problem is the internal bleeding.

01:12:12.563 --> 01:12:15.978
We've had some difficulty stopping the bleeding..

01:12:16.178 --> 01:12:17.279
That's getting his blood to clot.

01:12:17.953 --> 01:12:21.050
He hasn't fully responded to the transfusions, yet.

01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.953
But he's going to make it right?

01:12:23.153 --> 01:12:24.153
But he's going to make it.

01:12:24.353 --> 01:12:26.581
I promise you, we're gonna do everything we can okay?

01:12:33.513 --> 01:12:36.522
Please do whatever you can, please.

01:12:44.343 --> 01:12:45.506
We gotta lift him up, you all.

01:12:45.706 --> 01:12:48.123
We gotta lift Oscar up.

01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:32.495
You all, let's pray.

01:13:42.103 --> 01:13:43.343
<i>Heavenly father...</i>

01:13:43.543 --> 01:13:47.922
<i>We kneel before you..
And ask you..</i>

01:13:48.122 --> 01:13:51.220
<i>To put your healing hands around your child.</i>

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:54.458
<i>We ask you dear Lord...</i>

01:13:54.658 --> 01:13:57.263
<i>to operate through these doctors;</i>

01:14:00.154 --> 01:14:04.113
<i>Breathe strength into their hands Lord,
as they work on him.</i>

01:14:06.251 --> 01:14:08.795
<i>We are asking you right now, to heal him.</i>

01:14:10.563 --> 01:14:15.929
<i>Oh, Heal him lord,
so we can hold him and see his smile again.</i>

01:14:16.129 --> 01:14:20.106
<i>In your name, we pray. Amen.</i>

01:15:12.024 --> 01:15:13.185
He didn't make it.

01:15:19.997 --> 01:15:22.022
I need to see him.

01:15:24.081 --> 01:15:25.375
Okay, you can see him.

01:15:25.575 --> 01:15:28.264
But they don't want you go into the room and detach him.

01:15:28.464 --> 01:15:30.476
Cos they ruled it a homicide.

01:15:30.676 --> 01:15:33.011
I need to see him.

01:15:35.024 --> 01:15:37.024
I need to see him.

01:15:37.224 --> 01:15:38.224
I can take her.
- Okay.

01:16:21.204 --> 01:16:23.116
I told him to catch the train.

01:16:24.755 --> 01:16:27.354
I told him to catch BART!

01:16:27.554 --> 01:16:30.449
I didn't know they were gonna hurt him.

01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.665
I should have just let him drive.

01:16:34.865 --> 01:16:38.245
I should have let him drive.
I wanted him to be safe.

01:16:44.026 --> 01:16:45.544
You gotta let me hug him.

01:16:45.744 --> 01:16:48.697
Please, let me hug him.
Please.

01:16:50.379 --> 01:16:52.970
He didn't like to be alone!!

01:17:12.173 --> 01:17:13.619
Come on, T.

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.772
Where's Daddy?

01:17:38.305 --> 01:17:44.301
