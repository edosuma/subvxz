on the phone about the...

09:24.480 --> 09:26.630
...about the party decorations.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.992

09:31.200 --> 09:34.715
(PHONE RINGS) Shouldn't you be after
him or looking for fingerprints?

09:34.920 --> 09:36.876

your stepdaughter, sir,

09:48.120 --> 09:51.874

a name, a face,

10:01.960 --> 10:06.351
someone with a reason to do this,
please call me, Mr and Mrs McManus.

- Downstairs, asleep in our bed.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.919

12:23.880 --> 12:26.440
Why did we sleep at Dolly's house?

12:28.240 --> 12:31.755
Where's Julie?
Did Julie sleep here, too?

12:35.320 --> 12:36.753
Julie, ah...

12:39.080 --> 12:41.719
Where? Where is she?

12:45.360 --> 12:48.557
Megan, sometimes things happen.

12:49.920 --> 12:55.074
Bad things. Even to the people
we love the most in the whole world.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.511
- What happened?
- Well, Julie...

12:57.720 --> 12:59.438
Morning, everyone.

- Hello, little pumpkin.
- Morning.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.354

- I don't like eggs.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.869
- How about English muffins?
- No.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.596
- I'm so sorry.
- Hang in there.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.358
I'm fine.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.433
- Sharon.
- I don't know how to...

13:20.640 --> 13:23.677
- Thanks for coming.
- My deepest sympathy.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.192
- Sorry.
- My fault.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.755
Karen, let me clear this up. Really.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.400
- Karen, I'm so sorry.
- Aunt Flo.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.750
She was our special girl, wasn't she?

13:44.960 --> 13:48.430
You've got to move on,
to be strong for Megan.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.837
Thank you, Aunt Flo.
I must see to the coffee.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.112

- Fine.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.869

- Yes.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.911
Mack finally reached him.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.190
He was in Switzerland.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.273
So he's on his way back?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.311
No.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.033
Oh, Karen, I'm sorry.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.071
Talk about deadbeat dads.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.513
He never bothered much
with her, anyway.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.280
All those people out there... I gotta go.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.113
- Mrs McCann?
- Yes.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.993

Oh, yes, Gene. I remember you.

14:34.680 --> 14:38.798

- Her name's Flo.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.471
Aunt Flo, are you...?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.989
- Back to the chair.
- Is my hip.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.839
Les get her some water
or something.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.519
Are you OK, Flo?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.199
(SOBBING)

16:39.080 --> 16:40.479
Megan?

16:44.280 --> 16:47.033
I hate it when she runs off.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.551
Mommy.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.954
Mommy, Daddy.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.878
Mommy.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.799
- Wait for us.
- We'll be right down.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.679
Megan.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.555
Megan. Megan, come back.

17:44.880 --> 17:48.555
Don't ever run off
so far ahead, do you hear?

17:48.760 --> 17:52.196
Hey, are you OK?

17:53.000 --> 17:58.233
Mommy just wants you to wait for us.
We want to see the skeletons, too.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.555
- There you go.
- I... I thought...

18:03.760 --> 18:06.593
- He was right behind her.
- OK.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.154
- I'm not a neurotic.
- Don't act like one.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.397
She's all I've got left.

18:13.600 --> 18:17.115
- You've got me, too.
- I know I do.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.356
Mrs McCann. How are you?

18:29.560 --> 18:34.190
I'm all right. I was just wondering
how the investigation was coming.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.597
The investigation
is coming along very well.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.270
Good. What does that mean?

18:41.480 --> 18:44.995
- Well, why don't you take a seat?
- Thanks.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.315
You don't want all the details.
Ill just make it harder.

18:54.520 --> 18:58.479
There's nothing you can tell me
thas worse than what I imagine.

19:00.480 --> 19:05.952

guys who were at your house that day.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.991

19:09.040 --> 19:13.079
And we've got some samples
of his skin from under her fingernails.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.794
Maybe not enough for DNA testing.

19:16.680 --> 19:20.116
Do you want me to stop?

19:20.320 --> 19:25.314
We also have a medium sperm sample
mixed with your daughter's blood.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.511

Thas good evidence of forced...

19:30.160 --> 19:34.915
Well, anyway, thas about it for now.

19:35.520 --> 19:40.116
Thas good, right?
You're gonna catch this guy.

19:40.320 --> 19:44.836
Mrs McCann. I feel real good
about it. Real confident.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.158
Sweet tooth?

19:51.520 --> 19:54.557
Poor man's truth serum.
Caffeine and sugar.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.316
- You want one?
- All right.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.590
- Truth serum?
- Sure, you know,

20:00.800 --> 20:06.033
"I confess, I did it, but please...
don't tell my mother."

20:19.440 --> 20:24.468
This is a support group for parents
who've lost their children to violence.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.432
Maybe ill help.

20:28.680 --> 20:32.912
You show me your heartbreak,
I'll show you mine?

20:33.120 --> 20:35.554
What fun.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.592
- Are you ready for this?
- We're late, les skip it.

20:39.800 --> 20:43.270
No, no. Come on, les go.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.675
And this guy that killed her
got out on bail.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.189
He's free to hang out with his friends.

20:53.400 --> 20:57.791
My baby sister's gone for ever
and I don't know how to deal with it.

20:59.560 --> 21:03.519
How are you supposed
to process this?

21:03.720 --> 21:08.714
- How do you forgive someone like him?
- You can't let it fester in you, Tony.

21:08.920 --> 21:13.232
- There is another kind of justice.
- Oh, no, don't say that.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.432
- It won't solve anything.
- Look...

21:16.640 --> 21:20.519
I'm Irish Catholic
and I know killing is a mortal sin.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.553
And I know my little sister's in heaven.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.479
And I want to see her again.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.149
Albert, do you want to go next?

21:44.080 --> 21:46.116
Tim was twelve

21:46.320 --> 21:50.916
when a man named
Dexter Winter shot him in the head.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.680
Winter was robbing
a convenience store.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.916
Tim just happened to be there.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.112
His lawyer claimed
he'd suffered child abuse.

21:59.320 --> 22:03.313
Got his conviction reduced
from murder to manslaughter.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.592
- Jesus!
- Manslaughter.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.956
Do they know
what life is like without my son?

22:14.200 --> 22:18.716
Winter got paroled last week.
He'll be on the street in two weeks.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.195
Here he is.

22:28.240 --> 22:32.074
Francesca, dear.
Why don't you say something now?

22:32.280 --> 22:36.558
When my son's killer got paroled,
I planted a tree because I needed...

22:36.760 --> 22:39.115
- Come on.
- I'm talking about healing.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.436
But the killer is walking.

22:41.640 --> 22:45.519
- He's walking.
- I needed to sleep at night.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.234
- Les not do this.
- Let it go.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.839
All right.

22:50.040 --> 22:54.033
All right, everybody. Take it easy.

22:54.240 --> 22:58.995
Come on, calm down. All right?
Everybody just take a deep breath.

23:00.680 --> 23:06.789
Whas this? Oh, no.
Is my arch-enemy, Moby Duck.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.279
Oh, no.

23:16.120 --> 23:20.193
Megan!
Five more minutes before bedtime.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.028
We've got some new petitions here.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.596

so after you get your coffee,

23:29.800 --> 23:33.349
please bring it over and sign these.
We need your help.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.028
Nothing's going to go wrong.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.151
Why do you keep saying that?

23:38.360 --> 23:40.476
You're not making it any easier.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.035
- Nothing will go wrong.
- But...

23:43.240 --> 23:46.471
Sorry. I was just looking
for the ladies' room.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.911
Go back
and turn left at the exit sign.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.590
The bathrooms
are at the end of the hall.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.631
Thanks.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.908
- Do you think she heard anything?
- I'm scared.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.350
Our club hates to see new members.

24:04.560 --> 24:07.120
- But I'm glad to see you.
- Thanks a lot.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.918
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.635
- So this is your first meeting?
- Yeah.

24:12.840 --> 24:16.469
- What do you think?
- Pretty grim.

24:16.680 --> 24:20.673
- I'm Angel Kosinsky.
- Karen McCann.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.998
- My grandfather was Polish.
- So was mine.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.070
Why are you here?

24:29.280 --> 24:31.077
My son was killed.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.231
So was my daughter.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.998
I'm sorry.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.396
- Is he up here?
- No.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.351
Thas him.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.074
Thas Sean.

25:09.400 --> 25:13.473
Daddy. Daddy.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.195
I need to show you something.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.678
Come on, Daddy.

25:20.880 --> 25:25.829
- Can I get a cup of coffee?
- No. I need to show you something.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.116
Daddy, look what I did.

25:31.320 --> 25:35.518
- I ruined Julie's pillow.
- You didn't ruin it.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.790
We can get that stain out.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.393
Mama's gonna be very, very angry.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.477
Is good for you.
Is got potassium in it.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.910
- I don't like bananas.
- You want an apple?

25:57.120 --> 26:00.590
Oh, God! Mack.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.878
What?

26:04.280 --> 26:07.431
I'll kill her.
Maria washed Julie's pillow.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.712
- Karen, I washed it.
- You washed it?

26:10.920 --> 26:15.038
Mack, you ruined it. The smell's gone,
you can't get it back.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.708
Stop it.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.514
Megan dropped her
ice cream bar and stained it.

26:20.720 --> 26:25.475
It was an accident. She didn't
want to upset you, so we washed it.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.716
(PHONE RINGS)
Megan, I...

26:27.920 --> 26:31.276
- I'm sorry, Mack.
- Take it easy.

26:33.040 --> 26:36.874
You OK? I'm going to go
upstairs with her, OK?

26:38.640 --> 26:42.315
Hello? Mr and Mrs McCann?
This is Sergeant Denillo.

26:42.520 --> 26:46.718
- Hello? Please call me...
- Sergeant, don't hang up, I'm here.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.230
I just wanted to tell you
we've arrested a suspect.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.510
- Who?
- His name's Robert Doob.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.518
- He's from Jon's Market.
- I use them.

26:55.720 --> 26:59.076
He's a delivery man.
His blood is a positive DNA match.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.157
- You got him?
- Yes.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.351
I'm filing with the DA.
Is a dead-bang case.

27:03.560 --> 27:06.518
- I'll call you on the hearing.
- Thanks.

27:06.720 --> 27:10.076
- Mack. Mack.
- Yeah.

27:10.280 --> 27:15.593
- They got him. Mack, they got him.
- Thank God.

27:17.320 --> 27:21.233
A suspect in the Palisades murder
was apprehended today

27:21.440 --> 27:22.953
at Jon's Market in Santa Monica.

27:23.160 --> 27:27.790
- Look at him. Do you recognise him?
- No. I didn't the first time, either.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.275
I never saw him delivering here.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.392
Denillo says he's been in and out of jail
his whole life.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.068
Thas him. He's the one.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.513
- He did it.
- Honey, turn it off.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.598
- Just a minute.
- Not again.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.998
- Just a minute, OK?
- Is not a good thing.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.078
I just want to watch him
one more time.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.513
- There he is.
- All right.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.112
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Sergeant Denillo.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.880
I'm Howard Bolinger,
from the DA's office.

28:09.080 --> 28:11.958
- He's trying the case.
- What about Mr Randall?

28:12.160 --> 28:13.673
- Yes...
- He's been transferred.

28:13.880 --> 28:18.032
- I'm handling the case now.
- Transferred? Why weren't we told?

28:18.240 --> 28:19.514
Is all right.

28:19.720 --> 28:24.999
- It happens all the time.
- Don't worry. I've reviewed the case.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.158
This is just a little pre-trial motion
by the defence.

28:28.360 --> 28:33.115
The sergeans done an excellent job,
our evidence is conclusive.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.710
All rise.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.878
The Honourable
Judge Arthur Younger presiding.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.911
- Morning.
- Morning, Your Honour.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.394
Please sit.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.115
I'd like to request that my cliens
handcuffs be removed.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.869
- That would be fine.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

29:23.040 --> 29:27.033
All right, Counsel,
proceed with your motion.

29:27.240 --> 29:32.519
The prosecution collected sperm
samples from the victim for DNA tests.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.075
There is no problem
with this procedure,

29:35.280 --> 29:38.829
if the defence is allowed
to perform their own tests.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.873
The prosecution agreed
to supply the defence

29:42.080 --> 29:46.039
with at least 25% of the evidence
for counter-examination.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.037
We never received it.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.915
We never promised
a percentage of the evidence.

29:52.120 --> 29:58.389
Ms Juke was asked to participate in
an examination at the time, but declined.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.434
I have a letter from the DA's office,
promising the defence 25%...

30:02.640 --> 30:04.835
Quit looking at him so much.

30:05.040 --> 30:09.636
- I'd like to present it to the court.
- Objection. I know of no such letter.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.913
It was prepared by Mr Randall.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.032
May I see the document,
Your Honour?

30:17.760 --> 30:19.512
What?

30:19.720 --> 30:20.994
Wait a second.

30:21.200 --> 30:25.193
Mr Bolinger,
where's the rest of that sample?

30:25.400 --> 30:30.269
By the time we got a clean sample,
the 25% had already been utilised.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.392
But we gave her
the chance to be present...

30:33.600 --> 30:37.593
I request that the evidence
in this case be found inadmissible,

30:37.800 --> 30:42.999
since the prosecution failed to supply
the evidence promised us in writing.

30:43.200 --> 30:47.113
- Your Honour...
- This is an unfair attack on my client,

30:47.320 --> 30:50.471
and a breach of the promise
to release evidence.

30:50.680 --> 30:54.309
The evidence conclusively
identifies that man as the killer.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.556
All right.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.911
Counsel, can I talk to you,
off the record?

31:04.560 --> 31:10.271
- Is this your only physical evidence?
- The defence didn't get their sample.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.199
Randall promised it.
This guy didn't know.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.353
What is this?

31:17.320 --> 31:18.594
Is all right.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.074
All right, Counsel.
Please return to your seats.

31:27.800 --> 31:32.157
The law requires that the defence
be allowed their own DNA testing

31:32.360 --> 31:35.352
on all evidence
presented to this court.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.317
Therefore, in the interest of justice,

31:40.520 --> 31:43.512
the court reluctantly agrees
to suppress the evidence.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.711
I can submit the tests to you.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.596
Do the People have other evidence
that might meet their burden of proof?

31:52.520 --> 31:54.476
No, Your Honour.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.559
Your Honour, the defence request
that the charges be dismissed.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.035
Motion granted, case dismissed.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.794
- What now?
- How could you let this happen?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.560
You'll let him just walk out of here?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.116
- Sorry.
- Les go.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.071
No, Mr McCann, please.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.671
All right, come on.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.519

32:43.280 --> 32:46.795
- Are you saying she didn't come in?
- Yes.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.549
- Can you speak up?
- Karen's not here, I'm worried.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.593
- She didn't call?
- No. Do you want to leave a message?

- What, was my desk depressed?

38:51.760 --> 38:54.718
I watched him.
I found out where he lives.

38:54.920 --> 38:58.071
And he never even knew I was there.

- Did you tell Mack?
- No.

What are you doing? This is insane.

I shouldn't have said anything.

- Making sure you're not wired.

my daughter is free.

This is my son.

till he pays for what he did to her.

57:41.960 --> 57:44.428
I need you to help me.

57:49.080 --> 57:52.470
Do you know how
to defend yourself, physically?

57:52.680 --> 57:55.911
- Other than running like hell?
- This is no joke.

57:56.120 --> 58:00.272
We're not here for kicks.
We have things we'd rather be doing.

58:00.480 --> 58:05.110
But we're sticklers for justice,
since you can't count on the system.

58:05.320 --> 58:07.231
Justice.

58:07.440 --> 58:09.317
Can you go through with this?

58:09.520 --> 58:13.638
- Can you handle the consequences?
- Look, guys, I'm here, all right?

58:18.960 --> 58:22.794
OK. We can help you get a weapon.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.516
We can show you where to train.
We'll help you plan the hit.

58:27.720 --> 58:30.757
But you'll have to pull the trigger yourself.

58:32.760 --> 58:35.718
- I see.
- Do you?

58:36.280 --> 58:40.273
Desperately wanting someone dead
is not the same as killing them.

58:40.480 --> 58:42.710
Shooting paper
isn't like shooting flesh.

58:42.920 --> 58:44.194
Think it over.

58:44.400 --> 58:48.154
- You don't have to commit tonight.
- I'm in.

58:49.840 --> 58:52.559
One, two. Good. Keep going.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.320
Palm pulled back, aim into the face.

58:55.520 --> 58:58.557
Break it. One, two.

58:58.760 --> 59:01.877
Nice and strong.
Hit, hard as you can.

59:03.880 --> 59:06.110
Pay attention, everybody.
Here we go.

59:06.320 --> 59:07.833
Is OK to be scared.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.349
You relax, grab the gun.

59:10.560 --> 59:11.993
There's your target.

59:12.200 --> 59:16.159
Extend your arm,
bring the other one underneath it.

59:16.360 --> 59:19.591
Good. Relax.
Spread your feet out just a little.

59:19.800 --> 59:21.438
Good. There's your target.

59:21.640 --> 59:25.792
Now breathe and hold it in.
Hold it and squeeze, come on.

59:47.240 --> 59:48.832
Mama.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.390
- Mama.
- Oh, damn it!

59:54.680 --> 59:55.999
Never mind.

59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.273
Megan wants to show you something.
Could you pay her a little attention?

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.232
- I've a lot on my mind.
- So do I.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.034
Is different,
she wasn't your daughter.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.071
What did you just say?

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.509
You're not the only one who lost Julie.
I lost her, too, so did Megan.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.793
Don't you ever say that to me again.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.033
Mack?

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.153
She was my daughter, Karen.
I raised her with you.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.958
I loved her.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.914
And I miss her,
just as much as you do.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.999
I can take him anywhere I want.
From this position he's open.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.035
You can kick into the body or the front
kick into the groin that we learned...

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.871
He lives in this building.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.677
He usually comes down this street,
and parks in this parking lot here.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.872
There's a little alleyway right here.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.231
- Thas where you stand.
- OK.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.513
When you hear his jeep pull up,
wait till he turns the ignition off.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.599
When you hear the jeep door open,
you step out and...

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.398
- See you guys.
- Bye.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.550
I don't know, if we could just get
inside his head, just get him to speak.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.594
He's been depressed
as long as I've been here.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.518
I'm parked over here.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.597
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.791
- See you next Tuesday.
- Goodnight.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.070
Here, take my wallet.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.397
I don't want money.
I thought you were following me.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.391
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm not following you, I'm parked there.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.593
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.509
- I hope I didn't hurt you too bad.
- Well, you did.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.636
Hey, hey, hey.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.510
Relax, hey.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:52.752
Daddy. No, no! Daddy.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.958
- Daddy.
- No.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.835
- I'll go.
- Let me go.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.150
Daddy. Daddy.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.476
No! Daddy.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.638
Megan, honey.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.673
- Where's Daddy?
- He's sleeping.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.116
Did you have a bad dream?

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.469
Do you want to tell me about it?

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.958
Mama?

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.230
Are you still mad?

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.477
Mad at who? At you?

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.951
Sweetie, I was never mad at you.
Is that what you think?

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.469
It was my birthday.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.999
You think because it was
your birthday Julie died?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.151
Oh, Megan.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.837
Sit up, honey.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.873
Listen to me. It was not your fault.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.310
Sometimes when
terrible things happen,

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.353
we act in ways
others can't understand.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.835
I've just been so sad, Megan.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.358
- Mama?
- Yes.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.916
Will you sleep with me tonight?

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.112
I would like that. Will you let me?

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.273
So you trust her?

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.199
Yes. I trust her completely.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.710
She doesn't seem like a killer to me.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.831
I am not worried.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.510
I don't like her type.
Her hands are too clean.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.190
You need to relax. You were like this
with the Gratzes, too.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.838
Well, gotta go.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.794

- On my way.

- Michael's Garage.
- This is Mrs Benedetti.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.789
Hi, Mrs Benedetti. Your car's ready.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.629
- When can I pick it up?
- Ill cost a little more.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.833
- You said $350.
- Yes, but I had to replace the brakes.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.079
- Martin, you do this every time.
- Is normal wear and tear.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.840
You said that about the battery,
we changed three times.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.429
I don't have $250 more.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.039
- More tea?
- No, thanks.

The meeting ran late.
Do you want some tea?

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:26.557
I called today. Dolly said
you were having lunch with me.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.707
- Dolly's confused.
- Where were you?

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.194
I had lunch alone, why?

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.269
You go there most afternoons,
from 12 to 1.30.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:44.438
You've been going for three weeks.
And you've been lying to me.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.595
- You called there?
- What are you doing?

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.756
- I'm learning to shoot.
- What for?

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.872
- To defend myself.
- Why not tell me?

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.868
I'm learning other things,
too, exercise class, defence class.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.719
- Those cards are in my wallet, too.
- Don't say that!

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.435
- I've a right to defend myself.
- So why not tell me?

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.428
- It helps me get it all out.
- Do it with me. Do what you like.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.952
Scream, break everything in the house.
Just stop lying to me.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.436
All right. OK.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.389
OK.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.196
Did you buy one?

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.596

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.832
No.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.589
Jeez, I don't know, Karen.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.393
I don't know.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.354
- Maybe we should get outta here.
- Where'd we go?

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.838
Somewhere nobody knows us,
where we could be ourselves.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:55.637
- Could you take a few weeks off?
- Yes. Whatever it takes.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.234

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.950

Is your name Sean?

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.038
- Is your mommy here?
- Which one?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.556
Karen.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.512

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.551
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.470
- Sean, will you help me with something?
- Can I have money for a snow cone?

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:13.558
- OK.
- Why don't we sit down?

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.232
I don't want to sit down.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.070

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.034

being killed. I'm sorry.

I don't understand, I...

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.513
I thought you were like me.
Why the hell would you lie about that?

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.269
I was in those meetings
investigating vigilante activity.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.109
I work undercover. I'm with the FBI.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.237
Oh, my God.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.956
Walk away now and you'll be OK.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.879
- How could you pretend...?
- Just walk away.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.711
- I can't let him go.
- Let the law deal with this.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.195
I tried that.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.153
OK, let me spell it out for you.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.035
Is against the law to kill a person,
except in self-defence.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.034

spend the rest of your life in prison.

Besides, what legacy
are you leaving your little girl?

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.394
You've got to ask yourself, Karen...
What are you trying to teach Megan?

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.238
- Where are the other candles, Dolly?
- With your Christmas bonus.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.317
You deserved that.

- I can't. Sorry.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.157
Try giving him some candy.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.194
- We're doing our best.
- He knows exactly what he's doing.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.753
Unlike you.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.676
You wanna play this game?
What makes you so special?

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.317
Know how many bodies I see in a week?
I walk through blood every day.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.275
And you can't catch him, punish him,
or protect anyone. You're useless.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.349
I don't need this. I hear it every day, from
the lawyers, the media, and the crooks.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.790
Right now,
you sound the same as them.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.719
Yeah? How's this? Fuck you.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.714
One dollar fifty-six.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.438
Thanks very much.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:08.071
Tony, is me, Karen.
I left something in the office.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.830
- What do you mean, they're gone?
- They're gone.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.793
Hang on. Is Dolly,
she's hysterical about something.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.479
All right, keep going.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.069
Dolly?

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.953
They were in the boxes in my office.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:54.233
You saw them there yesterday.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.351
Dolly, slow down.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:01.394
I know we need them for the press
conference. They're there.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:05.479
Well, look again. I'm going away,
what am I supposed to do?

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.153
Please, you two go on.
I'll come tomorrow.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.557
- I have to help Dolly.
- Why can't she do it?

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:16.036
- You heard her.
- We'll wait. Whas another day?

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.631
- I want to go now.
- The idea was to all go together.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.311
This is my responsibility,
I can't just walk out on them.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.350
You don't trust me.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.312
Not particularly.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.636
Thas not fair.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.674
Maybe I'll be there tonight.
Is just a few hours.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.199
OK. We'll meet you up there.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.951
- OK.
- All right.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.916
Sweetie,
you're going ahead with Dad.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:57.148
I'll be there as soon as I can. You get
the house set up. Give me kisses.

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.511
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye, honey.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.758
Drive carefully.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.359
You too.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.759
Bye.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.998
OK, you're the navigator, so here.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.190
Come here, you piece of shit.
No, kiss my ass.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.356
- Go to hell.
- Come here.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.393
I work for the power
and water department.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:56.513
- My boss says we're cutting you off.
- What?

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.713
Ill only be off till tomorrow
morning, is that all right?

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.914
You bitch.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.428
# Old MacDonald had a farm
E-I-E-I-O

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.952
# And on this farm he had a... cow
E-I-E-I-O

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.071
# With a moo-moo here
And a moo-moo there

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.794
# Here a moo, there a moo
Everywhere a moo-moo... #

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.155
(MOZART CONCERTO)

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.150
"Tough titty," said the kitty,
"but the milk's still good."

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.511
- Where'd you hear that?
- The man at the school playground.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.030
- What man?
- The man Mommy watches on video.

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.914
- Did you tell Mommy?
- Yes, she talked to him.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.834
Shit.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.754
Les call Mom.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.554
Damn.

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.313
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.637
- You gonna shoot me?
- You broke into my house,

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.914
with intent to harm me. The law says
I have the right to protect myself.

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:57.240
What, do you want me to say I'm
sorry? It coulďve been anybody.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.590
I don't even remember
what she looked like.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.434
Is nothing personal.

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.552
She was seventeen years old.
Five foot two, she had brown eyes.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.428
Her name was Julie.
She was my daughter.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.711
She was a great fuck.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.113
Like I said, nothing personal.

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.429
Is very personal.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.516
At what time did you realise
he was in the house?

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:50.871
Was he alone? Could he
have followed you home?

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.116
How can we reach your husband?

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.436
- Is it your gun?
- Anyone else here?

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.996
- Les get you to the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.031
- You sure?
- Yes.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.996
- I know what you've done here.
- What?

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.079
I've been doing this a long time.
You haven't fooled me.

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.359
Prove it.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.075
- Daddy?
- Whas going on?

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.716
- What happened?
- Stay in the car.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.673
So what do you think?

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:36.317
Armed suspect, forced entry through
the back door, assault with intent.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.670
Clear case of self-defence.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.110
- Sir, you can't go in there.
- Stay there.

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.550
- Sir, sir!
- Officer, listen.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.117
Is my house. Thas my daughter
in the car. Stay with her.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.231
Whoa, whoa.

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:11.117
