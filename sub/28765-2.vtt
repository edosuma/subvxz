<i>Previously, on</i>
"Good Witch"...

00:02.689 --> 00:04.458
There's nothing I wouldn't
do for you.

00:04.546 --> 00:06.553
You keep talking like that
and I might have to marry you.

00:06.641 --> 00:07.653
How's tomorrow?

00:07.741 --> 00:09.467
I happen to have
some time on my schedule.

00:09.624 --> 00:11.362
The mayor of Blairsville
never complains.

00:11.450 --> 00:13.427
- You're the mayor.
- Donovan Davenport.

00:13.518 --> 00:16.253
- Sam, this is Vincent.
- The foster brother.

00:16.341 --> 00:18.872
A lot of things
keep going wrong.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.190
It's been eaten by moths.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.644
Catherine Merriwick
and her husband Douglas

00:22.732 --> 00:24.279
got married
under the Forever Tree.

00:24.367 --> 00:26.536
- Where is it?
- The tree has been lost to the ages.

00:26.624 --> 00:28.616
- It's out there, I'll find it.
- When the time is right,

00:28.703 --> 00:30.857
the Forever Tree
will reveal itself.

You caught me.

00:45.101 --> 00:46.716
And I'm glad I did.

00:47.982 --> 00:50.436
I just have one more thing
I need to work out

00:50.523 --> 00:53.047
- for the wedding.
- I'd be happy to help.

00:53.443 --> 00:56.099
You have always been there
for Grace and me.

00:56.763 --> 00:58.427
I don't know
what we would do without you.

00:58.515 --> 01:01.318
- We're family.
- Yeah, we are.

01:02.583 --> 01:04.162
And...

01:04.528 --> 01:06.232
I'd be honoured

01:06.482 --> 01:08.646
if you'd walk me down the aisle.

01:09.951 --> 01:11.372
Cassie...

01:11.810 --> 01:13.676
that means a lot to me.

01:13.935 --> 01:16.375
Is that a yes?

01:16.513 --> 01:18.639
It sure is.

01:19.359 --> 01:21.240
Aww.

01:21.909 --> 01:25.271
- Go, go, go! Go, go!
- Run!

01:25.428 --> 01:27.038
- Nice!
- Come on, you got it!

01:27.125 --> 01:30.287
Watch the ball all the way
until it hits your bat.

01:30.756 --> 01:32.435
OK? You can do it, buddy.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.465
- Oh... oh.
- Hey, good swing! Good swing.

01:37.553 --> 01:39.615
Nice try!
I'm never gonna hit it!

01:39.998 --> 01:42.756
Hey... buddy. Buddy, buddy.

01:44.016 --> 01:47.600
I know it's frustrating.
The more you practice,

01:47.857 --> 01:49.178
the better you're gonna get.

01:49.289 --> 01:51.084
- OK.
- OK?

01:52.645 --> 01:55.209
Come on, buddy.
Let's make that ball scared of you.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.575
<i>Come on, you can do this one!</i>

02:00.224 --> 02:02.927
- Yeah!
- Way to go, Michael! Yeah!

02:03.015 --> 02:04.122
<i>Run, run, run!</i>

02:04.210 --> 02:06.169
<i>- Good one!
- Good job!</i>

02:06.257 --> 02:08.461
<i>That's a home run
if I've ever seen one!</i>

02:11.234 --> 02:12.695
He did it!

02:12.997 --> 02:14.955
Oh.

02:15.042 --> 02:18.176
[exhaling heavily]
Ahem.

02:19.679 --> 02:22.290
<i>OK, let's keep going!</i>

02:25.087 --> 02:27.599
[soft music]

02:36.857 --> 02:38.685
The flowers look great.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.721
Clearly, this mayor
slash florist

02:41.808 --> 02:44.419
multi-tasking thing
isn't a problem.

02:44.724 --> 02:47.779
I guess you could say
that I am formidable.

02:48.458 --> 02:50.420
I suppose.

02:52.115 --> 02:53.842
- Stephanie.
- Hi.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.951
I've tried my hand, now,

02:56.039 --> 02:57.287
at the Bell, Book & Candle

02:57.375 --> 02:59.959
and at the flower shop,
but neither has

03:00.047 --> 03:02.912
really suited Martha 2.0.
[chuckling]

03:03.000 --> 03:06.005
So, while I'm waiting
to be reinstated as mayor,

03:06.178 --> 03:09.009
perhaps I could help you
at the Bistro.

03:09.146 --> 03:10.968
Oh... uh, you know,

03:11.055 --> 03:12.217
I would love that...

03:12.305 --> 03:15.459
- Oh!
- But we are all staffed up.

03:15.668 --> 03:16.959
Oh.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.487
Well... pity, really.

03:19.755 --> 03:22.370
I do know my way
around a kitchen.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.158
Bless you.

03:27.331 --> 03:28.768
Ah, ah.

03:28.927 --> 03:30.751
Well, finding the forever tree

03:30.839 --> 03:33.058
for Cassie is a lovely gesture.

03:33.145 --> 03:35.073
I wish I knew where it was.

03:35.161 --> 03:37.917
I wish you did too, Reverend.
I'm sure Cassie would have loved

03:38.005 --> 03:39.573
to carry on
the Merriwick tradition...

03:39.661 --> 03:41.737
of carving our initials
in the trunk.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.407
Bless you.

03:44.495 --> 03:47.440
Ahem. There's an awful lot
of hay around here.

03:47.931 --> 03:50.167
I'm gonna prescribe you
an antihistamine.

03:51.435 --> 03:53.885
Perhaps I'll step outside
to get some air

03:53.973 --> 03:56.698
before we start the rehearsal.
OK.

03:57.893 --> 03:59.842
[sighing]

04:02.815 --> 04:04.010
Still no word from Vincent?

04:04.098 --> 04:06.840
- Nothing. I called and texted.
- Hmm. Well,

04:06.958 --> 04:08.838
hopefully he'll get here
in time for the dinner.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.268
- We should get started.
- The barbecue

04:11.356 --> 04:13.183
smells great. Can we hurry up
with the rehearsal?

04:13.270 --> 04:15.206
You don't hurry a bride.

04:15.294 --> 04:17.470
Fine. I'm gonna go
grab a drumstick.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.603
No, wait. We're just about
to get started.

04:21.642 --> 04:24.690
Oh... Reverend,
you don't look so good.

04:25.038 --> 04:28.274
I'm really sorry.
Hopefully, I'll be fine

04:28.462 --> 04:31.485
by tomorrow.
You know,

04:31.573 --> 04:34.267
let's just get you home,
on that antihistamine.

04:34.355 --> 04:35.917
Oh, all right.

04:36.005 --> 04:37.746
You're good.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.589
So much for the rehearsal.

04:39.839 --> 04:42.711
- Then let's eat!
- Rehearsal or not,

04:42.846 --> 04:44.589
it's going to be
a beautiful wedding.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.221
Thanks, George.

04:46.385 --> 04:48.543
- Come on. Let's go.
- OK.

04:48.630 --> 04:50.089
Barbecue.

04:56.294 --> 04:58.917
Attention! Yoo-hoo!

04:59.643 --> 05:01.042
I just wanted to say

05:01.130 --> 05:02.958
a few words about Sam

05:03.046 --> 05:05.174
- and our beloved Cassie.
- Aw.

05:05.528 --> 05:08.705
I am just so thrilled...

05:09.706 --> 05:10.964
I'm sorry.

05:11.052 --> 05:13.881
I'm going to need
just a few moments.

05:15.703 --> 05:17.400
Aw...

05:18.503 --> 05:19.979
Cassie and Sam.

05:20.096 --> 05:21.635
Laurie sends her love

05:21.723 --> 05:23.003
and wishes she could be here,

05:23.091 --> 05:25.159
and I'm so happy
for both of you.

05:26.003 --> 05:28.721
But really, Nick is
the luckiest person here,

05:28.886 --> 05:31.846
because he gets to have Cassie
as a step-mom,

05:31.934 --> 05:36.120
and she is the best step-mom
a kid could ever ask for.

05:36.823 --> 05:39.495
I never thought
I'd see my dad smile so much.

05:39.583 --> 05:43.190
[chuckling]
It's a little annoying...

05:43.784 --> 05:46.034
but also pretty great.

05:46.237 --> 05:47.559
Thanks, Cassie.

05:47.706 --> 05:49.760
Cassie is...

05:50.136 --> 05:52.181
Well, she's just the...

05:53.867 --> 05:56.261
I wasn't sure about Sam
when he first arrived.

05:57.198 --> 05:58.483
And now...

05:59.307 --> 06:00.674
I'm still not sure of him.

06:02.119 --> 06:03.251
Just kiddin', Doc.

06:03.339 --> 06:06.026
You're a lucky guy.
So is Cassie.

06:06.114 --> 06:08.292
I wish you both
nothing but the best.

06:08.380 --> 06:11.383
Cassie, you always find
the joy in everything.

06:11.568 --> 06:14.049
And I'm really happy
that now you and Sam

06:14.137 --> 06:16.339
will find that joy together.

06:16.534 --> 06:20.016
Well, tomorrow wouldn't be
the same if we couldn't share it

06:20.120 --> 06:22.331
- with all of you.
- But no matter how much

06:22.419 --> 06:24.768
we love you, we're going
on the honeymoon alone.

06:24.856 --> 06:26.823

06:53.464 --> 06:55.760
Cassie, I've been thinking
about your dress problem.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.721
Now, I know a seamstress
who can work magic

06:57.809 --> 07:00.246
- with a sewing machine.
- And I appreciate that, Martha,

07:00.334 --> 07:02.554
but it would take magic to fix

07:02.642 --> 07:04.731
a moth-eaten dress over night,

07:04.819 --> 07:07.604
so... yeah, I've actually found
a dress in my closet

07:07.692 --> 07:09.667
that I can wear.
Cassie, you could

07:09.755 --> 07:12.453
wear a potato sack
and you would look beautiful.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.721
She's not wrong.

07:20.031 --> 07:22.338
[neighing]

07:35.027 --> 07:37.117
[neighing]

07:45.534 --> 07:48.159
It's OK. Easy, boy.

07:48.288 --> 07:49.964
I know.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.495
I know. I'm on edge too.

07:52.627 --> 07:54.604
Shh. Shh.

07:56.346 --> 07:58.706
Hey! I wouldn't get
too close if I were you.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.214
[neighing]

08:03.608 --> 08:04.608
[neighing]

08:08.163 --> 08:11.035
[sighing]

08:15.640 --> 08:17.106
Are you OK?

08:17.405 --> 08:20.593
[sighing]
I'm not sure.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.782
All the wedding hiccups:

08:25.987 --> 08:28.788
the cake topper melting,
the dress getting eaten

08:28.876 --> 08:30.944
by moths, the reverend
getting sick, I...

08:32.131 --> 08:34.986
I think that I'm the one
making those things happen.

08:35.335 --> 08:37.304
And why would you think that?

08:39.405 --> 08:41.482
You know I like Sam, right?

08:41.791 --> 08:44.822
I think that he's great,
and I think that you two

08:44.910 --> 08:47.304
are amazing together. I do.

08:47.507 --> 08:49.393
But...

08:50.844 --> 08:53.460
But... I, um...

08:54.615 --> 08:57.655
I've been thinking
about Dad a lot lately...

08:58.163 --> 09:00.252
and it just sort of hit me

09:00.340 --> 09:02.492
that you're about to be married

09:02.787 --> 09:04.952
to someone that isn't him.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.694
Oh, Grace...

09:07.999 --> 09:10.272
Look, I didn't...
I didn't mean for it to happen.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.788
Mom, I didn't. I just think
that all of this negative energy

09:13.876 --> 09:17.022
that I've been putting out
has affected the wedding.

09:17.335 --> 09:19.069
Honey, thinking about your dad

09:19.157 --> 09:21.343
is the very opposite
of negative.

09:21.879 --> 09:25.163
It's about the most wonderful
thing you could do.

09:25.968 --> 09:27.358
Believe me,

09:27.446 --> 09:30.460
you are not causing
anything bad to happen.

09:31.459 --> 09:32.518
Are you sure?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.241
I'm positive.

09:36.754 --> 09:40.108
So, why don't I go
make us some tea,

09:40.304 --> 09:42.085
and we can sit
and talk about this?

09:42.297 --> 09:43.952
Yeah, I'd like that.

09:47.862 --> 09:50.444
[soft music]
Vincent cleared

09:50.532 --> 09:52.708
out his room.
He's definitely gone.

09:52.796 --> 09:53.999
Hmm. I had a feeling.

09:54.087 --> 09:56.770
Yeah, I did too. I overheard
him on the phone earlier,

09:56.858 --> 09:58.766
sounded like he may have
lost the contract to sail

09:58.853 --> 10:01.567
- Jonathan Gardiner's boats.
- That's not a reason to leave.

10:01.655 --> 10:05.413
Yeah, for Vincent,
I think it's the only reason.

10:05.516 --> 10:06.523
- Hmm.
- I'm gonna try

10:06.611 --> 10:08.657
to track him down, see if I can
convince him to come back.

10:08.744 --> 10:11.617
- Thanks, Sam.
- You never have to thank me.

10:11.705 --> 10:14.577
- I should get this up to Grace.
- How is she?

10:15.515 --> 10:17.976
Uh... she misses her dad.

10:18.405 --> 10:20.811
Well, I hope she knows
I'd never try to replace him.

10:20.899 --> 10:22.770
Yeah, she knows that.
She thinks

10:22.858 --> 10:24.608
you're wonderful.
We both do.

10:25.483 --> 10:27.428
Anything else I can do for you
before I head out?

10:27.531 --> 10:30.921
Uh... just keep being there
for both of us.

10:31.601 --> 10:32.727
Always.

10:32.931 --> 10:35.542
[soft music]

10:39.381 --> 10:41.608
Hi, Dad.
You guys are still here?

10:41.696 --> 10:43.568
You're gonna miss the flight
of the fireflies.

10:43.656 --> 10:47.268
OK. I think we're ready.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.228
I've got the mini champagnes,

10:49.373 --> 10:51.505
the blanket
and the snakebite kit.

10:51.802 --> 10:54.460
- Snakebite kit?!
- It's outside in the woods.

10:54.548 --> 10:56.633
Never hurts to be prepared.
And I've got two sweatshirts,

10:56.720 --> 11:00.827
temperature's supposed to drop.
Cold, snakefilled woods.

11:00.915 --> 11:04.223
Are we sure we wanna do this?
I saw some hot chocolate

11:04.311 --> 11:05.773
with the little marshmallows
in the kitchen.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.593
Dad, it's five minutes
to the woods.

11:07.739 --> 11:10.265
It's something Mom was really
looking forward to, right?

11:11.926 --> 11:14.858
- Well...
- You know... oh, gosh.

11:15.088 --> 11:18.526
I just remembered
that I have to steam my dress.

11:18.918 --> 11:21.608
And it's a big day
for everyone tomorrow,

11:21.696 --> 11:23.257
especially you.
Yeah.

11:23.721 --> 11:25.757
Don't you worry about me, Sam.

11:26.201 --> 11:28.124
I'm fine.

11:29.867 --> 11:32.913
What? You heard her,
she's fine.

11:33.413 --> 11:35.015
Want some hot chocolate?

11:51.538 --> 11:53.561
You went to Mayor Davenport's
office?

11:53.710 --> 11:54.780
No!

11:54.868 --> 11:56.460
No, no, no, no, no, no!

11:56.619 --> 12:00.061
Meetings such as these
require neutral ground.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.390
Walk me through what happened,
step by step.

12:03.478 --> 12:05.567
I'd love to, Martha, but...

12:05.659 --> 12:07.722
it's confidential information
between mayors.

12:07.910 --> 12:09.581
[sighing]
At this rate, my house is

12:09.669 --> 12:12.367
gonna stay
in Blairsville forever.

12:12.813 --> 12:15.605
For future reference,
tact and diplomacy

12:15.693 --> 12:18.987
should be your cornerstones.
Remember, meeting on a neutral

12:19.075 --> 12:21.456
playing field is the only way
to keep your opponent

12:21.544 --> 12:23.214
from automatically gaining

12:23.319 --> 12:25.792
the upper hand.
Oh, and whatever you do,

12:25.880 --> 12:28.187
do not escalate the situation.

12:29.386 --> 12:31.142
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you done?

12:31.268 --> 12:32.994
Apparently.

[video game sound effects]

12:40.243 --> 12:42.150
Yes! We did it!

12:43.064 --> 12:44.337
You wanna play another round?

12:44.425 --> 12:46.541
- Of course.
- Cool.

12:46.806 --> 12:49.041
I'll get us some refills.

12:52.553 --> 12:54.127
You two look like
you're having fun.

12:54.215 --> 12:57.523
Oh, Lindsay's great.
I like her a lot.

13:00.089 --> 13:03.179
- Spill.
- I was supposed to tell

13:03.267 --> 13:05.027
her something, but I ended up
asking her out.

13:05.171 --> 13:07.213
- What didn't you tell her?
- I said I was waiting for

13:07.300 --> 13:09.440
my college acceptance letters,
but I didn't even send in

13:09.527 --> 13:11.048
my applications.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.320
You told me you applied
for early decision.

13:14.415 --> 13:18.033
- But you didn't apply at all?
- Lindsay, I...

13:18.183 --> 13:19.877
You know what?
It's getting late.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.345
[sighing]
Wait! I...

13:22.596 --> 13:24.946
It's OK, Nick. I gotta go.

I...

[soft music]

13:34.247 --> 13:35.857
Cassie's worried about you.

13:36.852 --> 13:38.611
There's nothing
to worry about.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.931
You're... sitting in
an empty baseball field.

13:42.315 --> 13:44.796
At night.
Hmph.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.604
How'd you know I was here?

13:47.837 --> 13:50.650
You said baseball
was your thing. Took a shot.

13:54.098 --> 13:55.839
[Sam sighing]

13:56.482 --> 13:58.283
Why'd you disappear?

14:00.246 --> 14:02.267
That's something the old Vincent
would have done.

14:02.666 --> 14:05.587
Jonathan Gardiner found
someone else to sail his yachts.

14:05.752 --> 14:07.564
You think not having a job

14:07.652 --> 14:09.087
changes how people look at you?

14:09.175 --> 14:10.806
I know it does.

14:12.337 --> 14:14.509
Not the ones
that care about you.

14:18.213 --> 14:20.869
I just wanted
to prove myself to Cassie.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.861
Cassie's the one person

14:22.949 --> 14:25.056
you don't have
to prove yourself to.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.228
You don't think
she'll be disappointed?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.455
Only if you're
not at the wedding.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.796
[♪♪♪]

14:43.458 --> 14:44.828

Yes, I am.

Let me guess: 12 orange juices.

14:52.198 --> 14:53.564
[chuckling]

14:53.739 --> 14:56.837
Actually, a coffee
and a maple bacon donut.

15:00.862 --> 15:04.681
You know, I, uh... saw you
coaching this morning.

15:05.283 --> 15:06.814
You're really great
with those kids.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.852
Thanks. You know,
they're great too,

15:10.077 --> 15:12.002
when they're not dancing
in the outfield.

15:12.252 --> 15:14.681
Isn't that what baseball
needs, more dancing?

15:14.769 --> 15:17.814
How are you not
the commissioner?

15:21.138 --> 15:22.783
So how come
you didn't come say hi?

15:22.909 --> 15:24.759
Oh! Uh,

15:25.024 --> 15:26.556
well...

15:27.318 --> 15:29.166
I actually saw you
hugging your girlfriend,

15:29.254 --> 15:31.430
- and I didn't want to interrupt.
- What?!

15:32.658 --> 15:34.064
That's Michael's mom.

15:34.152 --> 15:38.228
She was actually just thanking
me for helping him hit the ball.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.716
So, not your girlfriend?

15:40.804 --> 15:42.022
No.

15:42.298 --> 15:45.205
'Cause, uh, I actually
was going to ask you

15:45.293 --> 15:47.469
if you wanted to get
some coffee sometime.

15:49.822 --> 15:51.369
I'd love to,

15:52.229 --> 15:54.710
but I'm just kind of dealing
with some things

15:54.798 --> 15:56.298
- right now.
- Oh!

15:56.438 --> 15:58.548
- Yeah.
- Then we never have to mention

15:58.636 --> 16:01.697
this again, and I will see you
on game day for orange juice.

16:02.937 --> 16:04.112
Thanks.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.072
- I'll see you then.
- Yeah.

See you.

Hey. I forget how
beautiful this is.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.259
Yeah.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.416
I miss coming out here.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.065
Used to be yours
and Daddy's favourite place.

16:32.723 --> 16:34.812
You guys would sit out here
for hours and look up

16:34.900 --> 16:36.689

Do you remember
when you fell in?

He splashed us, right?

16:41.871 --> 16:43.482
Yeah, and then
you started crying.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.939
I did?

16:45.400 --> 16:48.189
Ten seconds later,
you were laughing your head off.

16:48.802 --> 16:49.978
Hmm...

16:52.593 --> 16:55.134
Daddy had the best laugh.

16:55.574 --> 16:58.814
Mhm. And it always
made you laugh.

to notice it.

It wants you
to notice it.

No matter where you are
in your life,

you can always

17:35.064 --> 17:36.712
look up at that star

17:37.280 --> 17:40.265
and know that your dad
is watching over you.

17:42.443 --> 17:44.601
And you.

Your dad will always be
with both of us.

was for us to be happy.

You should try it
with Mom sometime.

- I heard my name.
- Ah, could you make me a bagel?

for the past 30 years.

Well, this is great.
Now, the handle is stripped.

of antique hardware

Well, I like to be prepared
for any emergency. Shall we?

19:29.318 --> 19:30.886
Yeah, as soon
as I get my bagel.

19:30.974 --> 19:32.472
Don't keep
the bride out too long.

Alright.

Actually,
Dad's doing me a favour.

last look for the Forever Tree.

maybe I can fix Mom's dress.

part of your waterline
in Middleton.

You shut off my water.

I guess I'm more formidable
than you thought.

You're so proud of yourself.

- It's extortion.

to see you again.
I just came to bring

Cassie her phone.
She left it at the ranch.

about the whole college thing.

you had to.

So does Jennifer.
It was our wedding song.

It's a surprise.

What's wrong?

Lindsay thinks
I play videogames too much.

- You do.
- 'Cause I'm good at them.

that kind of time

into planning your future.
Well, maybe videogames

22:33.941 --> 22:36.283
are in my future.
It's the maybe part

I'm renting
Mayor Davenport back

22:52.673 --> 22:54.092
the use of his town's waterline.

22:54.180 --> 22:56.366
I'll use the money to improve
Middleton's playgrounds.

22:56.454 --> 22:58.412
Oh! Very noble.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.683
And of course, I applaud
you putting the children first,

23:00.770 --> 23:03.381
but what about my situation?

23:04.256 --> 23:05.405
I suggest you keep

23:05.493 --> 23:07.577
looking for Martha 2.0.

Now, if you don't mind,
that is my chair.

Fine.

as far as I can tell,

23:34.074 --> 23:35.946
I should be looking

23:36.424 --> 23:37.835
right here.

23:37.983 --> 23:40.762
Oh, well, that would
put you in the middle

which is now a swimming hole.

I've been staring
at these maps for two days!

23:49.944 --> 23:52.006
I wish the Forever Tree
would pop out at me.

23:52.115 --> 23:53.768
Kind of like
it would for Cassie?

23:53.856 --> 23:55.597
Exactly like that.

23:55.831 --> 23:57.877
But even Cassie doesn't know
where it is.

23:57.996 --> 24:00.788
- Hide and seek.
- Yeah. A vicious game of it,

24:00.884 --> 24:03.543
- and the tree's winning.
- No, no, no. When I was a kid,

24:03.631 --> 24:05.951
my friends and I used to play
hide and seek in these woods.

24:06.038 --> 24:09.715
I would always hide behind
this pile of rocks in the corner

24:09.825 --> 24:11.445
of the picture. I remember
'cause I thought it looked

24:11.532 --> 24:13.967
- like a wolf.
- Can you tell how to get there?

24:14.055 --> 24:16.186
I could mark it on the map.

24:19.741 --> 24:22.628
