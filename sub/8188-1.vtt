00:41.741 --> 00:43.641
<i>Everyone has their path in life,</i>

00:43.743 --> 00:46.337
<i>and this is more or less</i>
<i>where mine started.</i>

00:46.446 --> 00:50.849
<i>My name is Norbit Albert Rice,</i>
<i>and I was an orphan.</i>

00:56.256 --> 00:58.247
<i>I like to think my parents</i>
<i>loved me very much,</i>

00:58.358 --> 01:00.986
<i>but just didn't have the means</i>
<i>to properly care for me.</i>

01:01.094 --> 01:04.221
<i>I can see them researching</i>
<i>all of the orphanages in the area,</i>

01:04.330 --> 01:06.230
<i>agonizing over their choices,</i>

01:06.332 --> 01:08.596
<i>trying to make sure</i>
<i>their precious little boy</i>

01:08.701 --> 01:11.602
<i>was raised in the perfect environment.</i>

01:27.287 --> 01:30.120
Ling Ling! Someone left another one!

01:31.391 --> 01:33.882
Coyotes, go! Get! Back! Back, coyotes!

01:34.794 --> 01:37.922
Get out here! You not eat another baby.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.798
Oh, crap. Another black one.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.474
Can't give these away.

01:53.813 --> 01:57.214
You ugly black one, too.
You be here long time.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.783
Nobody ever come and say,
"Give me the ugly, black one."

02:00.987 --> 02:04.081
You very ugly baby.
The ugliest baby I ever seen.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.221
<i>A lot of people think</i>
<i>that orphanages are cold and scary,</i>

02:07.327 --> 02:10.056
<i>but the Golden Wonton</i>
<i>was a great place to grow up.</i>

02:10.163 --> 02:13.860
<i>We had everything</i>
<i>normaI children had. Pets...</i>

02:14.400 --> 02:17.062
Here. Play with that.

02:19.305 --> 02:23.571
<i>...a big backyard,</i>
<i>and lots of kids to play with.</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:27.276
Ling Ling!
The children got in MSG barrel.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.348
Now all their hair gonna fall out again.

02:29.449 --> 02:32.680
You stupid orphan!
Nobody want a bald orphan!

02:32.785 --> 02:35.310
Norbit, how you find family with no hair?

02:35.922 --> 02:37.389
Nobody want a bald Norbit!

02:37.490 --> 02:39.788
What the hell wrong
with the children here?

02:39.893 --> 02:42.259
<i>Mr. Wong was a very interesting man.</i>

02:42.362 --> 02:46.492
<i>ln addition to his love for children</i>
<i>and preparation of fine Asian cuisine,</i>

02:46.599 --> 02:49.591
<i>he had a real passion</i>
<i>for old-time whallng.</i>

02:49.702 --> 02:51.670
It's a whale, ho!

02:54.908 --> 02:56.739
Die, you son-of-a!

02:58.878 --> 03:01.438
Bingo! Right in the blow hole!

03:04.784 --> 03:08.550
Norbit, where you go?
Why you run off like little bitch?

03:09.856 --> 03:13.087
<i>After Marvin Browning got lost</i>
<i>downtown for a couple of weeks,</i>

03:13.193 --> 03:15.354
<i>the orphanage started using</i>
<i>a buddy system.</i>

03:15.461 --> 03:16.485
Go, Norbit!

03:16.596 --> 03:18.530
<i>My buddy was little Kate.</i>

03:18.631 --> 03:21.998
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

03:24.671 --> 03:27.196
That's okay. You're doing good.

03:31.911 --> 03:35.904
<i>Kate and I were always together.</i>
<i>Playing checkers...</i>

03:36.115 --> 03:38.583
-Oh, man.
-Yes!

03:41.020 --> 03:43.147
<i>...watching scary movies.</i>

03:45.592 --> 03:48.686
<i>Why, we even pooped together.</i>

03:49.829 --> 03:54.232
<i>And then one day, Kate and I decided</i>
<i>that we should tie the knot.</i>

03:54.334 --> 03:57.167
<i>We got married</i>
<i>under the great big oak tree.</i>

03:57.270 --> 03:59.704
I now pronounce you my wife.

04:01.774 --> 04:04.402
And I pronounce you my husband.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.210
It's watermelon.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.378
Yours is green apple.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.221
I think it's time for us to kiss now.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.189
<i>And we lived happily ever after</i>

04:25.732 --> 04:29.498
<i>for about two weeks</i>
<i>untiI she got adopted.</i>

04:33.740 --> 04:35.435
Bye, Norbit.

04:36.342 --> 04:39.470
<i>I didn't do too much bike riding</i>
<i>after that.</i>

04:42.081 --> 04:44.948
<i>When Kate left, there was an</i>
<i>odd number of kids at the orphanage,</i>

04:45.051 --> 04:47.986
<i>so I was buddyless for a while.</i>

04:48.221 --> 04:51.952
<i>And sometimes I'd get a little sad,</i>

04:57.397 --> 04:59.262
<i>but I never lost hope.</i>

04:59.365 --> 05:03.631
<i>I knew that someday I'd find</i>
<i>another somebody to share my life with.</i>

05:03.736 --> 05:07.035
<i>all I had to do was just be patient.</i>

05:10.209 --> 05:13.007
-What'd you do that for?
-Because we feIt like it.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.512
-What are you gonna do about it?
-What are you gonna do about it?

05:15.615 --> 05:16.582
Loser.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.380
Stop it.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.793
Leave him alone.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.829
-Says who?
-Says who?

05:33.733 --> 05:37.635
-Who are you?
-Rasputia. What's your name?

05:37.937 --> 05:42.465
-Norbit.
-Norbit? That's a stupid name.

05:42.775 --> 05:46.040
-Why'd you beat those boys up?
-To protect you.

05:46.145 --> 05:49.945
-You got a girlfriend, Nesbit?
-Norbit.

05:50.650 --> 05:51.912
No.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.977
Well, you do now.
Get your ass up and hold my hand.

05:56.255 --> 05:59.122
-Okay.
-How you doing?

06:00.326 --> 06:03.989
<i>Everything changed</i>
<i>once I had Rasputia as my girlfriend.</i>

06:05.131 --> 06:07.224
<i>We took care of each other,</i>

06:08.801 --> 06:10.860
<i>and the other kids</i>
<i>started to respect me.</i>

06:10.970 --> 06:12.528
I'll take...

06:21.080 --> 06:23.514
-Norbit.
-Come on.

06:23.816 --> 06:27.752
<i>And because of Rasputia,</i>
<i>for the first time in my life,</i>

06:27.854 --> 06:30.914
<i>I had a real family.</i>

06:31.023 --> 06:33.218
<i>Rasputia had three brothers.</i>

06:33.326 --> 06:35.817
<i>Big Black Jack. He was the oldest.</i>

06:35.928 --> 06:37.088
Leg.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.465
<i>Then, there was Blue.</i>

06:42.468 --> 06:43.958
Breasts.

06:45.204 --> 06:47.968
<i>And Earl. He was the baby.</i>

06:48.074 --> 06:49.336
Wing.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.641
<i>They sure loved their little sister,</i>

06:52.745 --> 06:55.043
<i>and so they treated me</i>
<i>like one of their own.</i>

06:55.148 --> 06:58.015
Here you go, Norbit.
Saved the best piece for you.

06:58.317 --> 07:02.117
-What's that?
-Turkey ass. Eat up, sucker.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.017
Bon appetitty.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.283
Bon appetitty.

07:09.629 --> 07:10.926
<i>The Latimores had a reputation</i>

07:11.063 --> 07:13.964
<i>for being the meanest,</i>
<i>nastiest people in town,</i>

07:14.066 --> 07:16.728
<i>but that's just because</i>
<i>folks didn't know them.</i>

07:16.836 --> 07:19.498
<i>They were actually</i>
<i>very nice, hard-working people.</i>

07:20.473 --> 07:22.805
<i>They ran</i>
<i>the local construction company,</i>

07:23.376 --> 07:25.936
<i>and recently, responding to the needs</i>
<i>of the community...</i>

07:26.045 --> 07:27.034
Yo, Morris.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.944
<i>...had opened a little security business.</i>

07:30.583 --> 07:33.916
<i>It was a surprisingly popular service</i>
<i>among the local vendors.</i>

07:34.020 --> 07:37.751
Hey, you don't shake me down.
I'm Italian. I shake you down.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.381
-Is that right?
-Yes.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.221
Get his ass in here.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.659
I'm in.

07:50.970 --> 07:56.272
<i>As time passed,</i>
<i>Rasputia and I got closer and closer,</i>

07:56.809 --> 08:01.109
<i>in high school and as adults.</i>

08:02.482 --> 08:05.918
<i>I started working as a bookkeeper</i>
<i>in her family's business.</i>

08:06.652 --> 08:09.587
I'm expecting
some important calIs today, Norbit,

08:09.689 --> 08:11.324
so when you answer the phone,
try and sound white.

08:11.324 --> 08:11.915
so when you answer the phone,
try and sound white.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.652
<i>It was like everything was</i>
<i>finally coming together.</i>

08:14.760 --> 08:15.727
Yes.

08:16.395 --> 08:19.626
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it was only naturaI that Rasputia and l</i>

08:19.732 --> 08:22.326
<i>would take the next step</i>
<i>in our relationship.</i>

08:22.435 --> 08:25.962
I now pronounce you man and wife.

08:28.207 --> 08:30.232
You may kiss the bride.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.095
Open your mouth.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.771
Go, Rasputia!

09:08.814 --> 09:11.806
<i>It was a storybook wedding,</i>

09:11.918 --> 09:14.648
<i>the beginning of a brand-new chapter.</i>

09:15.688 --> 09:21.092
<i>I knew I would never be lonely again.</i>
<i>I had found my place in the world.</i>

09:22.128 --> 09:24.187
Poor Norbit. Man.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.766
Back when I was in the game,
I used to tell my hos,

09:27.867 --> 09:32.566
"Hos, ain't no man gonna pay for
the cow if he can get the milk for free."

09:32.672 --> 09:35.106
You ain't got to worry
about this brother buying the milk,

09:35.207 --> 09:38.005
'cause he just bought
the whole damn cow.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.943
That's a speciaI cow, too.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.843
That must be
where buttermilk come from.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.506
Sing that shit, girl.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.481
Them are not dimples.
Them are potholes in her ass.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.884
Look like an Escalade
in a wedding dress.

09:53.659 --> 09:55.593
It a horror show.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.994
Norbit. What a woman you got.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.032
-Hi, fellows.
-We're all jealous, right, boys?

10:01.133 --> 10:04.625
-Oh, yeah. Way jealous.
-Wish I had one like that.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.672
Norbit, let me talk to you for a second.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.134
Look, just so we clear.

10:12.311 --> 10:16.680
lf you ever hurt my sister in any way,

10:16.782 --> 10:21.515
make her cry,
even make her sad one time,

10:22.722 --> 10:26.249
I'm coming at you
with razor blades and lemon juice.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.455
-You hear me?
-Yes.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.620
I'm talking pain, boy.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.893
Searing, mind-numbing pain.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.467
I understand.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.763
-You understand me?
-Yes, yes, yes.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.167
all right.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.604
-Welcome to the family.
-Thank you.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.707
Somebody is take
a big hunk out of my cake!

10:55.421 --> 10:58.584
What y'all looking at?
I ain't had no cake.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.285
You better mind your damn business.

11:06.399 --> 11:10.631
Hey, hey! Everyone!

11:10.736 --> 11:13.364
I am Mr. Wong.
I am best man in wedding.

11:13.472 --> 11:18.842
I feel it my place to say something,
make a toast to bride and groom,

11:18.944 --> 11:21.845
tell story about Norbit.
I like Norbit father.

11:21.947 --> 11:24.575
I raise Norbit. He like my own child.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.085
And I want to say that
I very, very confused, Norbit,

11:28.187 --> 11:30.485
that you... You marry Latimore.

11:30.589 --> 11:34.389
I don't understand it, because
when you was a little boy, you say,

11:34.493 --> 11:39.829
"One day I find the girI of my dreams."
And then you marry a gorilla.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.559
I joke, I joke, I joke.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.603
Why you not know joke
when you hear joke?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.265
Why you wanna make fight at wedding?

11:48.374 --> 11:52.743
CooI off, before I have to
bust somebody ass in here. Okay.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.642
When Norbit just little boy,

11:55.748 --> 12:01.050
he like to always
run all over place naked. Always naked.

12:01.620 --> 12:05.818
And Norbit, when he was just little boy,
had a pee-pee the size of an egg roll.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.189
-You know, Norbit.
-That's true.

12:10.396 --> 12:14.093
And one day, down by creek,
Norbit run around naked

12:14.200 --> 12:18.102
and poisonous snake jump up
and bite Norbit right on ass.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.940
Very close to hole.

12:24.076 --> 12:27.068
Norbit pass out. I think Norbit is dead.

12:27.179 --> 12:31.309
I go to check the boy puIse.
He still allve. He still allve!

12:31.417 --> 12:35.080
"Okay," I say,
"I must do something to save child."

12:35.187 --> 12:37.212
So, I start to think,

12:37.323 --> 12:43.284
"Do I suck poison out of Norbit's ass
or do I let him die?"

12:44.730 --> 12:47.858
I do the most responsible thing.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.959
I say, "Hell to the no!

12:52.071 --> 12:53.971
"Norbit is out of here,

12:54.073 --> 12:55.973
"because it is long time in hell

12:56.075 --> 12:59.442
"before Wong suck poison
out of another man's ass."

13:03.082 --> 13:06.415
But strange, mystical thing
happen, Norbit.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.613
Even though poison is in Norbit,
he not die.

13:09.722 --> 13:13.180
Norbit get stronger and stronger.

13:13.292 --> 13:17.695
That why I know, Norbit,
deep down inside, you very, very strong.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.890
You strong like warrior.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.230
That's why I say to you, Norbit,
you can survive anything.

13:23.602 --> 13:24.899
Even...

13:27.306 --> 13:30.002
So I say to everyone here, and to Norbit,

13:30.109 --> 13:34.739
I wish you much happiness and peace
and love,

13:34.847 --> 13:39.477
and lots of bananas for your new gorilla.

13:39.585 --> 13:42.520
I only kidding. To Norbit and Rasputia.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.086
Norbit, you know
what would be so romantic?

13:46.192 --> 13:50.253
lf you'd carry me over the threshold
like a little chocolate drop.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.396
Be delicate, now.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.937
Put your back into it.

14:03.242 --> 14:06.473
Come on, now. Be a man.
You ain't no man.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.610
Pathetic.

14:12.284 --> 14:16.186
Rasputia, I know we're both nervous
because we've never done this before,

14:16.288 --> 14:19.815
but we can take our time, darling.
ln sweet time.

14:26.098 --> 14:29.499
<i>Rasputia was so fulI of love.</i>

14:32.137 --> 14:33.502
Merry Christmas!

14:35.641 --> 14:37.404
Ho, ho, ho!

14:37.509 --> 14:40.034
<i>It was a love that sustained us</i>
<i>through the years.</i>

14:40.145 --> 14:41.237
HaIt!

14:44.283 --> 14:46.843
187. Officer down.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.147
<i>And it's still going strong.</i>

14:50.089 --> 14:51.647
Happy Presidents' Day!

14:54.260 --> 14:56.490
God bless America.

14:57.796 --> 15:02.631
<i>And so, we began our life together,</i>
<i>like any other happily married couple.</i>

15:02.835 --> 15:04.462
Morning, Rasputia.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.060
"Morning, Rasputia," my ass.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.298
I tell you what. You better do something
about that goddamn dog,

15:08.407 --> 15:09.567
because I ain't gonna be
getting terrorized

15:09.675 --> 15:10.972
by no dog on my own property.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.271
I'm sick of it! I'm gonna go out
and purchase me a pellet rifle!

15:13.379 --> 15:14.846
And then I'm gonna give him
something to bark about

15:14.947 --> 15:18.508
when I start popping pellets
in his little bug-eyed bastard's ass.

15:19.618 --> 15:23.076
Messing around with you,
now I'm gonna be late for dance class.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.353
God damn it, Norbit.

15:30.462 --> 15:33.454
How many times I got to tell you, when
you drive my car, don't adjust my seat!

15:33.565 --> 15:36.966
-I haven't touched your seat.
-Then why is it up so damn far?

15:37.069 --> 15:40.266
It looks like it's back
as far as it goes, Rasputia.

15:40.472 --> 15:41.905
No, you moved it. I can tell, 'cause look,

15:42.007 --> 15:44.942
when I inhale,
my titty make the horn honk. Listen.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.306
You see that?

15:47.813 --> 15:50.145
-That ain't right.
-I hear it.

15:50.249 --> 15:53.343
That scientifically prove
that you was adjusting my seat.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.545
-That's not science.
-It is. Now just let it go.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.054
-It's not science.
-I said let it go.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.853
-I'm just...
-I said it was science, God damn it.

16:05.397 --> 16:10.357
Why you think I want to sell

I make a lot of money here.

16:14.406 --> 16:20.675
Every man got a price.
We think this might be yours.

And stretch it out.
Work your whole bicuspids area,

18:20.732 --> 18:24.600

Very good.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.068
Excuse me, Buster?

18:26.171 --> 18:27.798
I think I need
a little adjustment over here.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.033
Look at you,
looking like the Great Pumpkin, girl.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.939
Trick or treat. What's going on?

18:32.044 --> 18:35.275
Well, see, I was born with a trick hip
and it made me real bendy.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.871
See, I'm just like licorice. Look.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.309
Goddamn, girl,
that look like the harvest moon.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.651
-Turn a brother to a werewolf.
-You just need to stop.

18:44.756 --> 18:48.021
You know what?
Do you do any private lessons?

18:48.927 --> 18:52.158
I could do private lessons
if you could do me a little favor.

18:52.264 --> 18:53.322
What's that?

18:53.432 --> 18:58.062
Just need you talk to your little brothers
about funding my little video tape.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.933
I'm trying to make power-tap
more international.

19:00.038 --> 19:01.596
I'm trying to be like Billy Blanks,

19:01.707 --> 19:03.299
but double the money
and half the Blank.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.103
That's a good idea.

19:05.210 --> 19:09.340
Maybe I will, maybe I will.
But, first, I got to get that private lesson.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.541
Okay. Call me, girl.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.619
-I'll call you.
-I'll be your private dancer.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.287
-Must be Saturday.
-Why is that?

19:20.592 --> 19:23.186
Because here come Norbit,
right on schedule.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.190
Almost set your watch to him.

19:27.533 --> 19:30.661
Hey, Pope Sweet Jesus
and Lord Have Mercy.

19:30.769 --> 19:31.963

19:32.070 --> 19:33.094
Business is good.

19:33.205 --> 19:35.730
Business is good.
It's almost like the good old days.

19:35.841 --> 19:36.808
Yes, indeedy.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.171
What do you mean,
"the good old days"?

19:38.277 --> 19:40.837
The good old days, man,
back when we was pimping, Norbit.

19:40.946 --> 19:41.935
You know.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.342
-You guys used to pimp?
-"Used to"?

19:43.448 --> 19:46.747
That's a violation. still pimping.
Once a pimp, always a pimp.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.013
-Always. Forever.
-Boss player.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.322
Rasputia sent me down here
to get the usual.

19:51.423 --> 19:52.447
You guys are open, right?

19:52.591 --> 19:54.582
We always open.
Go on and take yourself in there, Norbit.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.887
We'll stack that up for you.

19:59.298 --> 20:00.993
-Moniqua!
-Yes, Daddy.

20:01.099 --> 20:04.557
Can you get King Kong
three large buckets, extra sauce?

20:04.670 --> 20:06.160
-Please don't trim the fat.
-Yes, Daddy.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.466
Please don't trim that fat.
She wilI kilI me.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.098
Norbit, while I got your attention,

20:10.209 --> 20:13.440
can I interest you in some new shoes,
maybe a haircut?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.513
How about a bath or a sink?

20:15.614 --> 20:18.276
Hey, don't tell me

20:18.383 --> 20:20.715

20:23.388 --> 20:26.585

20:27.826 --> 20:30.021
I got to go do a puppet show
for the kids at the orphanage.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.095
At the orphanage?

20:31.196 --> 20:33.460
That's a nice thing you do
for them little kids over there.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.089

20:35.200 --> 20:36.462

Man, your wife was
just talking about you.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.935
Man, she love you.

21:50.042 --> 21:55.207
-You're Rasputia's tap dance teacher.
-Man, actually, I'm her power-tap guru.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.942
I was just here
giving her a little tap lesson.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.745
But you're naked.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.384
That's just so she could see
the various muscle groups

22:02.487 --> 22:03.818
as I go through the various routines.

22:03.922 --> 22:07.517
You see that there?
You can't see that with a turtleneck.

22:09.127 --> 22:10.651
And you have an...

22:10.762 --> 22:13.822
Oh, man,
I'm just real passionate about dance.

22:13.932 --> 22:16.594
You can say the word "dance"
and he just jump up. Dance!

22:16.702 --> 22:18.431
See that? See that there?

22:18.704 --> 22:19.796
'Sputia?

22:19.905 --> 22:21.896
Norbit, Buster's a guest in our home.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.668
How dare you insinuate
something like that?

22:23.775 --> 22:25.333
Yeah, Orbit!

22:25.444 --> 22:28.709
How dare you insinuate
something such like that!

22:28.814 --> 22:33.547
You know, I am actually offended
by your accusization, you understand?

22:33.652 --> 22:37.019
And rather than sit here and have
a belligerent confrontation with you,

22:37.122 --> 22:39.590
'cause I am a God-fearing man,

22:39.691 --> 22:44.060
I'm'a do like Jesus H. Christ
would do in a situation such as such

22:44.162 --> 22:46.960
and I'm gonna turn the other cheek.

22:47.065 --> 22:48.362
Amen.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.995
You happy now?

22:55.107 --> 22:57.075
Rasputia, you cheated on me!

22:57.175 --> 22:58.802
Look, I told your ass
ain't nothing happened,

22:58.910 --> 22:59.968
and the next time you say
it happened again,

23:00.078 --> 23:02.512
I'm gonna knock your teeth
out your mouth.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.675
Rasputia, we took vows.
I'm your husband.

23:06.451 --> 23:10.182
Rasputia, we took vows,
and you cheated on me!

23:10.522 --> 23:12.387
It never happened!

23:13.959 --> 23:15.551
Yes, it did!

23:15.660 --> 23:19.721
And that makes you
the queen of whores!

23:25.203 --> 23:26.670
Hey, Norbit!

23:34.179 --> 23:35.737
Run for your lives!

23:38.850 --> 23:40.112
Bastard! Come here!

23:42.721 --> 23:45.019
Oh, sweet Moses! Oh, my God!

23:45.123 --> 23:47.489
Come here! Come here!
Come here to me!

23:47.592 --> 23:48.752
No! Leave me alone!

23:48.860 --> 23:50.487
You ain't nothing
but a goddamn coward!

23:50.595 --> 23:51.960
Saddle tramp!

23:57.803 --> 24:00.067
That's what your stupid black ass get!

24:00.172 --> 24:02.265
I hope you broke your ass!

24:03.975 --> 24:05.533
Since you feel like running, Norbit,

24:05.644 --> 24:08.477
why don't you run your ass
down to the Rib Shak

24:08.580 --> 24:10.982
and get me a short stack of ribs?

24:10.982 --> 24:11.812
and get me a short stack of ribs?

24:11.917 --> 24:14.477
Extra hot sauce.

24:14.586 --> 24:17.987
all this setting you straight
done got me famished.

24:25.931 --> 24:27.990
I'm Little Red Riding Goose,

24:28.099 --> 24:30.727
walking through the forest,
minding my own business,

24:30.836 --> 24:32.701
when all at once...

24:32.804 --> 24:33.930
Hello.

24:34.039 --> 24:37.702
-Who are you?
-I'm the big, bad pig of the forest.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.573
My, what big eyes you have, Pig.

24:40.679 --> 24:42.670
The better to see you with, Goose.

24:42.781 --> 24:46.046
And my, what a big nose you have, Pig.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.780
The better to smelI them scrumptious
goodies you got in your basket.

24:49.888 --> 24:52.516
Hey, let me take a look in there.

24:52.624 --> 24:56.788
Oh, no, you don't.
You're gonna try to steaI my food.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.328
No, I won't steaI your food.

24:58.430 --> 25:01.228
Don't let that pig
push you around, Goose.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.461
Yeah, I'm tired of
you pushing me around.

25:04.569 --> 25:06.628
Look, I'm tired of
playing with your ass, bitch.

25:06.738 --> 25:08.330
I know you got ribs in that basket.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.805
You better give them up smooth

25:09.908 --> 25:12.342
or I'm gonna break my hoof off
in your goose ass.

25:12.444 --> 25:15.208
Oh, really? Well, why don't you get up
off of your lazy behind

25:15.313 --> 25:17.440
and go down to the Rib Shak
and get your own ribs?

25:17.549 --> 25:20.177
Or better still,
why don't you just call Buster

25:20.285 --> 25:22.378
and tell him to come over
and power-tap you,

25:22.487 --> 25:24.614
because in addition to being
the pig of the forest,

25:24.723 --> 25:27.521
you're aIso a saddle tramp,
whore, bitch pig...

25:27.626 --> 25:31.756
Norbit! What you doing?
This supposed to be a children's show.

25:31.863 --> 25:35.890
This remind me
of Chinese snuff film I once co-star in.

25:36.001 --> 25:39.437
I'm sorry. I got a little carried away.

25:39.638 --> 25:42.607
Wow, Norbit,
that was some puppet show.

25:44.843 --> 25:48.176
Oh, come on. You don't remember me?

25:50.382 --> 25:53.408
-Kate. Kate.
-Come here!

25:53.518 --> 25:56.976
Kate! Kate! Oh, God!
I can't believe it! Kate!

25:57.289 --> 25:59.348
Well, can I have a hug?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.717
Norbit.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.491
It just like old times.

26:07.599 --> 26:10.295
Maybe you two go take poop together.

26:16.942 --> 26:19.103
This place has not changed at all.

26:19.210 --> 26:22.976
Oh, yeah. Some of this furniture's
even come back in style.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.345
So, how long are
you gonna be visiting for?

26:25.450 --> 26:27.680
No, I'm not visiting. I'm moving back.

26:27.786 --> 26:30.619
Really? Wow.

26:30.722 --> 26:33.418
I sold my clothing business in Atlanta,

26:33.525 --> 26:36.722
and I'm going to use the money
to buy the orphanage.

26:36.828 --> 26:38.261
What?

26:38.897 --> 26:43.334
Mr. Wong's getting older.
He wants to go whallng, so...

26:43.802 --> 26:47.829
You know, it's always been my dream
to come back here and take over.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.937
That's great.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.110
Norbit, look.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.676
That's the tree we got married under.

26:59.918 --> 27:02.443
You know, I've still got my ring.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.218
I ate mine.

27:06.891 --> 27:09.485
I missed you so much when you left.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.592
I missed you, too.

27:15.066 --> 27:16.658
That's my car.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.967
We didn't really get a chance
to catch up much.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.508
I'll be back in town on Tuesday.
You wanna have lunch?

27:26.044 --> 27:28.638
Yeah, I would love to
have lunch on Tuesday.

27:28.747 --> 27:29.975
-I love lunch.
-Okay.

27:30.081 --> 27:33.812
Lunch, yes. For sure.
I love lunch. Tuesday.

27:34.285 --> 27:35.343
I'll see you Tuesday.

27:35.453 --> 27:39.048
I'll see you on Tuesday.
We'll have lunch on Tuesday.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.549
Tuesday.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.689
Tuesday. Tuesday.

27:44.796 --> 27:48.459
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday.

27:48.733 --> 27:52.499
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday...

27:52.604 --> 27:56.404
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday...

28:01.713 --> 28:04.238
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

28:04.349 --> 28:07.512
<i>Tuesday, Tuesday...</i>

28:07.619 --> 28:11.555
Say "Tuesday" again
and you ain't gonna see Wednesday!

28:11.656 --> 28:13.783
I got it. I'll get it. Tuesday.

28:14.459 --> 28:17.223
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

28:18.163 --> 28:19.960
-Buster. How you doing? You look great.
-Hey.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.226
-Oh, thank you, man.
-Good to see you. Good to see you.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.324
Thank you.
I thought you were gonna be at work.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.698
Yeah, I'm on my way out now.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.965
But hey, look,
there's cold beer in the refrigerator

28:28.073 --> 28:30.200
and there's fresh sheets on the bed.
Go have a great dance lesson.

28:30.308 --> 28:31.468
-all right.
-all right.

28:31.576 --> 28:32.804
Power-tap.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.709
Very good, very good.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.183
Tuesday.

28:42.353 --> 28:44.878
What's wrong with your boy?
He real cooI all of a sudden.

28:44.989 --> 28:48.823
Yeah, I don't know what the hell got
into him, but I know I got dance fever.

28:48.927 --> 28:51.395
Ready for a little power-tap, huh?

28:52.831 --> 28:54.628
Lord, give me strength.

28:55.366 --> 28:56.958
Hey, Sam, happy Tuesday.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.228
Norbit.

28:58.336 --> 28:59.462
Norbit.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.438
-Hey, Kate. Hi.
-Come on, I got us a table.

29:02.540 --> 29:04.235
Great. I've been looking forward to this
all week.

29:04.342 --> 29:05.809
Good.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.537
Hey.

29:08.179 --> 29:09.237
Hey. Who's he?

29:09.347 --> 29:11.406
Norbit, this is my fiancé, Deion Hughes.

29:11.516 --> 29:14.508
How you doing, my man?
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.746
-This is your fiancé?
-Yes, sir.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.688
I was just telling Deion that you and l
were buddy partners at the orphanage.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.725
Now she and I are buddy partners.

29:21.826 --> 29:25.762
Shame on you, man,
letting a girI go like this. I feel for you.

29:25.864 --> 29:28.332
And so Deion's got all this experience
in real estate,

29:28.433 --> 29:31.368
so he's going to help me buy
the orphanage, Norbit. It's so exciting!

29:31.469 --> 29:33.198
No, wait, wait. No, no.
Slow down, slow down.

29:33.304 --> 29:35.966
I mean, you know,
we're just out here just scouting it out.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.133
all right? This is her nest egg,
you know.

29:38.243 --> 29:39.904
I don't want her
making any hasty decisions

29:40.011 --> 29:41.808
that she might regret later, you know?

29:41.913 --> 29:44.438
She worked too hard for this money,
man, you know what I mean?

29:44.549 --> 29:47.074
Deion, you take
such good care of me, baby.

29:47.185 --> 29:49.847
It's my job. Stop it.

29:50.588 --> 29:51.987
Okay?

29:56.761 --> 29:59.286
Don't you just love Tuesdays?

30:04.335 --> 30:08.362
Lloyd, just tell me why it has to hurt
so GD much.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.401
What's the matter, boy?

30:14.512 --> 30:18.573
You sensing an earthquake
or some other sort of naturaI disaster?

30:24.055 --> 30:25.886
That's just my...

30:26.524 --> 30:27.821
My wife.

30:38.069 --> 30:40.230
A man needs his own space.

30:49.948 --> 30:53.611
Finally! For the love of Cain.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.058
Moses!

31:02.427 --> 31:05.328
I'll see you suckers
tomorrow at the picnic!

31:20.511 --> 31:22.479
Damn it, Norbit!
How many times I got to tell you,

31:22.580 --> 31:23.911
don't be messing with my car seat!

31:24.015 --> 31:25.880
Nobody touched your old, stupid seat.

31:25.984 --> 31:29.351
Then how come
it's all mushed up like this, then?

31:29.454 --> 31:31.422
Well, you know, Rasputia,
you've been eating so much lately

31:31.522 --> 31:36.118
there's a very strong possibility that...
The car is shrinking.

31:36.227 --> 31:39.219
Might be shrinking.
The car is being smaller.

31:39.330 --> 31:44.029
Yeah, you might be right. Been raining
a lot lately. all this moist weather.

31:44.135 --> 31:47.662
-Oh, yeah? That'll make it shrink.
-This weather's so moist.

31:54.045 --> 31:55.706
How you doing?

32:00.118 --> 32:03.485
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was hot like me</i>

32:03.588 --> 32:06.386
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was a freak like me</i>

32:06.891 --> 32:08.188
<i>Don't cha</i>

32:09.394 --> 32:12.329
Look at that dog over there,
eyeballing me.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.126
Rasputia, what are you doing?

32:15.233 --> 32:16.495
Shut up!

32:17.068 --> 32:20.799
-Hey, slow down! You're gonna hit him!
-I got you now. I got you now!

32:23.741 --> 32:25.800
-Stop it! No!
-I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

32:25.910 --> 32:29.073
Rasputia, don't! No! No! No!

32:35.620 --> 32:36.955
I know what that sound means!

32:36.955 --> 32:37.387
I know what that sound means!

32:37.488 --> 32:39.718
Bark! How you doing!

32:39.824 --> 32:41.018
Lloyd!

32:42.093 --> 32:44.220
Enough is enough.

32:44.329 --> 32:47.355
Now, where in the hell
do you think you're going?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.326
Lloyd's in the hospitaI because of you!

32:49.434 --> 32:51.459
Yeah, that's right.
I put his little dog ass in the hospital.

32:51.569 --> 32:54.163
And I'd have put it in the morgue, too,
if you didn't mess with my car seat.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.671
It threw off my driving skilIs.

32:55.773 --> 33:02.303
Rasputia, you are a mean, selfish, cold,
heartless woman, and I am leaving you!

33:02.480 --> 33:04.505
-You leaving me?
-Yes!

33:05.283 --> 33:07.012
Well, where the hell
you think you're going, big shot?

33:07.118 --> 33:08.847
You ain't got no money.
You ain't got no family.

33:08.953 --> 33:10.545
Everything is in my name, the car,
the house...

33:10.655 --> 33:13.146
You ain't nothing and you ain't gonna
never be nothing without me, Norbit!

33:13.257 --> 33:17.193
Norbit, you just can't leave!
Norbit, please, I'm with child!

33:19.630 --> 33:21.257
With child?

33:21.366 --> 33:25.803
Oh, yes, Norbit, can't you tell?
I'm getting a little belly.

33:26.871 --> 33:29.897
And my titties is all achy and itchy-like.

33:30.041 --> 33:33.340
Oh, Norbit, we gonna be a family.

33:34.512 --> 33:40.178
Oh, Norbit, come hug me,
Daddy, please.

33:42.086 --> 33:44.919
Please, Norbit.

34:03.808 --> 34:05.867
I understand, little pony.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.668
I know your pain.

34:10.014 --> 34:11.914
Oh, yes, I know.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.076
Excuse me, snow bunny.

34:16.187 --> 34:19.588
I don't come in your jurisdiction,
throwing town picnics.

34:19.690 --> 34:23.626
Yet here you is all up in mines,
pimping hos.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.360
It's just a kissing booth.

34:25.463 --> 34:29.194
Call it what you will,
but Pope Sweet Jesus

34:29.300 --> 34:30.960
is taking half.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.563
You work for me now, ho.

34:35.940 --> 34:36.929
Sure.

34:37.041 --> 34:38.440
Let me taste the goods.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.976
Put it on me.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.974
-Greasy.
-Greasy.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.911
We back in business.

34:47.284 --> 34:50.344
I wanna be a ho. How do I apply?

34:50.588 --> 34:54.684
Please, Lord Jesus, help me!
Look, look, tickets! Hey, tickets, tickets.

34:54.792 --> 34:56.384
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Line up with your buddy.

34:56.494 --> 34:57.654
Line up with your buddy.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.195
-You got one, sweetie.
-Can we go on the jumper?

34:59.297 --> 35:00.286
Yeah, yeah, you go.

35:00.398 --> 35:03.367
Baby, you know I love you.
I love these kids.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.493
It's just that
I don't think buying an orphanage

35:05.603 --> 35:08.697
is the right move financially right now.
That's all.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.865
Hey, this is not
a financiaI decision, Deion.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.341
-I thought you understood that, baby.
-No. No, I do. I do, baby.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.174
But this the call I was telling you...
The business call, it's very important.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.145
Let's talk about it
when I get back to the house, okay?

35:18.249 --> 35:19.477
You're not going to stay?

35:19.584 --> 35:21.916
No, very important. Here.

35:23.321 --> 35:27.052
Hello? It's never a bad time for you.

35:29.694 --> 35:30.683
Stop it! Stop!

35:30.795 --> 35:32.092
Norbit!

35:32.530 --> 35:34.293
-Hey.
-Hi.

35:36.033 --> 35:37.000
Hey.

35:37.101 --> 35:39.797
-I didn't know you were gonna be here.
-Oh, yeah.

35:39.904 --> 35:42.236
Hey, you know, I just saw Deion leaving.

35:42.740 --> 35:45.641
He had some business to take care of.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.771
So, who are you here with?

35:49.480 --> 35:51.038
My wife.

35:54.385 --> 35:58.082
-Norbit, I didn't know you were married.
-Yeah.

35:58.189 --> 36:02.216
-Well, that's wonderful. Really.
-Thank you so much.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.987
So, where is she?

36:05.763 --> 36:08.163
Right over there in the print outfit.

36:08.266 --> 36:11.201
The one talking to the girI by the bench?

36:11.802 --> 36:15.033
No, the one sucking the jelly
out of them donuts.

36:18.876 --> 36:21.811
Oh, yeah. She's pretty.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.944
That's cherry.
Is that cherry or strawberry?

36:25.049 --> 36:27.574
What are my kids doing? Peter! Theo!

36:27.685 --> 36:30.051
I don't want you bothering anyone.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.890
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Rice.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.185
Mrs. Rice?
My name ain't no damn Mrs. Rice.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.693
Oh, I just thought
'cause you're married to Norbit...

36:37.795 --> 36:38.921
Who the hell are you?

36:39.030 --> 36:42.090
Kate, this is my wife,
Rasputia Latimore,

36:42.200 --> 36:43.599
and, Rasputia, this is Kate.

36:44.168 --> 36:46.398
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

36:46.504 --> 36:48.734
Kate's an old friend of mine
from the orphanage.

36:48.839 --> 36:51.569
Latimore, as in Latimore Construction?

36:51.676 --> 36:53.507
Yes, that's right,
as in Latimore Construction.

36:53.611 --> 36:54.873
That's right. Why?

36:54.979 --> 36:56.344
Well, just that this is perfect,

36:56.447 --> 36:59.939
'cause I was going to come see
you guys about a renovation of...

37:00.218 --> 37:01.651
I ain't come out here for that.

37:01.752 --> 37:04.084
I'm out here to enjoy these festivities,
not to be talking no business.

37:04.188 --> 37:05.678
You wanna talk business,
my brother is Big Black Jack

37:05.790 --> 37:06.757
over there by the BB guns.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.586
Go over there and talk to him.
I ain't got no time for this.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.456
Oh, sure, okay.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.290
Well, go on, get.

37:13.431 --> 37:15.126
-Okay.
-Okay.

37:19.470 --> 37:22.166
-Come here.
-What, Rasputia?

37:22.273 --> 37:24.741
You thinking about creeping, ain't you?

37:24.842 --> 37:25.934
We're just friends.

37:26.043 --> 37:28.739
What'd I tell you about having friends?

37:28.846 --> 37:30.370
Go over there
and get me another wine cooler.

37:30.481 --> 37:32.745
It's hot as hell out here.
Don't you see I'm sweItering?

37:32.850 --> 37:36.445
-Rasputia, you can't drink wine.
-Why the hell not?

37:37.788 --> 37:41.224
-You're with child.
-With child? I ain't with no...

37:42.927 --> 37:46.328
Oh, that was... I had gas. I still got it.

37:48.065 --> 37:51.557
There's your child.
Now, go get me something to drink.

37:59.977 --> 38:01.308
Twins!

38:02.513 --> 38:03.673
Hey! You come back here!

38:05.650 --> 38:07.811
-Oh, my God!
-Move your fat ass, boy.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.150
Look, you got one!

38:14.225 --> 38:15.692
Get him. Get him, Big Black.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.829
Are you Big Black Jack?

38:20.197 --> 38:21.824
What it look like?

38:21.932 --> 38:24.298
Oh, well.

38:24.402 --> 38:27.530
Me and my fiancé
are buying the Golden Wonton...

38:27.638 --> 38:30.971
Wong's place? He's selling it to you?

38:31.075 --> 38:33.600
Yeah. Why is that surprising?

38:33.711 --> 38:35.872
Miss Thomas, Miss Thomas, let's go.
They're starting the music.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.447
-Oh, great!
-Come on. Let's go.

38:37.548 --> 38:40.039
Can we finish this up later?
Apparently I have to go dance now.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.642
all right, baby. You go dance now.

38:43.921 --> 38:46.287
The orphanage is in play.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.121
Y'all better give me my hat.
Give me the hat!

38:52.229 --> 38:53.662
Here, take her hat.

38:53.864 --> 38:57.493
You think I won't come up in here?
I'm gonna come up in here.

39:06.744 --> 39:07.733
You think I'm playing?

39:07.845 --> 39:09.574
Give me the hat right now,
or I'm gonna tear your leg off.

39:10.748 --> 39:12.409
Hey, Norbit, come on!

39:12.550 --> 39:15.485
Oh, no. No, I can't.
Rasputia's waiting for me.

39:15.586 --> 39:17.918
-Come on, dance with us.
-No, really, I shouldn't...

39:18.022 --> 39:21.617
Don't think I won't kilI a child.
I'll kilI a child in front of everybody.

39:21.726 --> 39:23.626
Little street urchins.

39:25.629 --> 39:29.087
Okay. That's it.
Now it's time to bring the pain.

39:36.173 --> 39:38.664
Dance, Norbit, dance! Come on!

39:43.447 --> 39:44.573
My hat!

39:49.320 --> 39:50.878
It's raining little white women.

39:50.988 --> 39:52.888
My prayers have been answered!

39:52.990 --> 39:56.050
She'd better move,
'cause my prayer is for a Cadillac.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.534
You little bastards.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.540
Where the hell is Norbit
with that wine cooler?

40:14.645 --> 40:16.442
I'm thirsty as hell.

40:25.956 --> 40:27.446
Oh, hell, no.

40:29.527 --> 40:31.119
Oh, he's lost his mind.

40:33.731 --> 40:35.221
Bitch, that's my wine cooler!

40:35.332 --> 40:38.529
It's my birthday! It's my birthday!

40:38.636 --> 40:40.831
It's your birthday?
You think it's your birthday, huh?

40:40.938 --> 40:43.372
Norbit's got moves, everybody! Yeah!

40:43.507 --> 40:45.873
You got him loose, don't you,
you little skinny bitch?

40:45.976 --> 40:49.139
I see what you trying to do.
I see just what you trying to do.

40:49.246 --> 40:53.012
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

41:22.179 --> 41:23.441
Hey, buddy partner.

41:23.547 --> 41:27.449
Hi, Kate. Hi, nice to see you.
How you doing?

41:27.952 --> 41:30.614
I'm good, but how about you
and your head?

41:30.721 --> 41:32.484
Oh, I'm doing better.

41:32.590 --> 41:37.084
The doctor said if it weren't for
my hard Afro, it could have killed me.

41:41.665 --> 41:45.226
Are you sure you're okay, Norbit?
That sounds kind of fast.

41:45.336 --> 41:49.602
Oh, well, they're doing some tests.
They're kind of monitoring me.

41:51.575 --> 41:54.203
Well, I don't know about this stuff,
but 1 10 beats per minute,

41:54.311 --> 41:57.280
that's kind of high. 120...

41:57.681 --> 41:59.808
Oh, my goodness, 130!

41:59.917 --> 42:03.353
Yeah, maybe the machine's broke.
I'm just gonna take these off.

42:15.733 --> 42:16.791
You Deion Hughes?

42:16.901 --> 42:18.266
Who's asking?

42:18.869 --> 42:20.359
We the Latimores.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.632
Yeah. Latimore Construction.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.401
And we run this town.

42:24.508 --> 42:27.807
Your woman was telling us how y'all
was planning on buying the orphanage.

42:27.912 --> 42:29.709
Kate has her plans and I have mine.

42:29.813 --> 42:32.247
Well, it looks like the only plans you got,
my man, is leaving.

42:32.349 --> 42:34.180
I ain't sticking around
raising no damn orphans.

42:34.285 --> 42:36.617
I got kids of my own
I ain't even bringing up.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.415
So, you was just hustling her?

42:38.522 --> 42:41.753
Break it to her gentle for me,
would you? I'm out!

42:42.526 --> 42:45.893
Hold up, player.
I think you missing the flow here.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.865
That orphanage she buying,
that's a huge property,

42:48.966 --> 42:51.025
outside of town, zoned commercial.

42:51.135 --> 42:52.602
Even got a liquor license.

42:52.703 --> 42:54.136
lnteresting.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.433
It's a perfect place for a titty bar.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.106
-Did you say "titty bar"?
-Titties.

42:59.209 --> 43:00.642
We got it all worked out.

43:00.744 --> 43:03.304
We gonna call it Nipplopolis.

43:03.614 --> 43:04.979
Nipplopolis.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.575
Shit got a ring to it, don't it?

43:07.785 --> 43:10.515
We talking about overpriced,
watered-down alcohol

43:10.621 --> 43:13.522
and fake tig old bitties in abundance.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.316
Ain't gonna be nothing but tax-free,

43:15.426 --> 43:17.417
under-the-table, pure cash money.
Big time!

43:17.528 --> 43:18.495
That's right.

43:18.596 --> 43:22.896
all you got to do is swing us the deal
and we make you partner.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.262
And what about Kate?

43:24.368 --> 43:27.895
lf you marry her,
it's as much yours as hers.

43:28.806 --> 43:33.436
Norbit, I really want you
to be a part of the orphanage.

43:33.544 --> 43:35.808
The kids are crazy about you.

43:35.913 --> 43:37.938
-They're good kids.
-Yeah.

43:38.048 --> 43:41.609
You know, I'm gonna take them
bike riding tomorrow, down by the lake.

43:41.719 --> 43:43.653
Why don't you come?

43:43.854 --> 43:46.846
I don't know if I could go for a bike ride.

43:47.057 --> 43:50.083
I never... I didn't really know how, the...

43:50.194 --> 43:53.459
I can't ride a bike still.

43:54.164 --> 43:56.394
You never learned? What?

43:56.500 --> 43:58.525
Well, you left, you know,

43:58.636 --> 44:00.160
and there was nobody
there to teach me.

44:00.270 --> 44:02.204
And Wong don't ride.

44:02.740 --> 44:05.766
Okay, we'll do something eIse.
The water park.

44:05.876 --> 44:07.639
The kids have been begging me
to take them there.

44:07.745 --> 44:09.440
Oh, I don't know about the water park.

44:09.546 --> 44:11.776
Come on, it's a Saturday.
You don't have to work.

44:11.882 --> 44:15.283
Yeah, I know, but it's the park
and it's watery,

44:15.386 --> 44:21.018
and there's a potentiaI hell to pay
if I were to be there maybe...

44:21.892 --> 44:24.520
Hey, what are you doing
with those things, Kate?

44:24.628 --> 44:27.722
Well, I'm just going to have to shock you
tilI you say yes.

44:27.831 --> 44:29.696
Hey, come on, Kate.
Don't play with those.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.462
-Those things are plugged in. It's hot.
-Clear.

44:32.569 --> 44:34.935
No, no clear. No clear. Stop, Kate.
Stop, Kate.

44:35.039 --> 44:36.734
Come on. Yes.

44:36.840 --> 44:40.105
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes! Okay, stop. Nurse!

44:52.723 --> 44:57.524
Oh, my God, Deion. This is beautiful.
I didn't even know you could cook.

44:57.728 --> 45:00.856
I just wanted to do something special
for you, you know, from the heart.

45:00.964 --> 45:02.898
Well, I am feeling it.

45:04.902 --> 45:08.895
Let's do it. Let's get married, right away.
I don't wanna wait.

45:10.474 --> 45:13.068
-Deion.
-Church is free on Saturday.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.804
You're serious?

45:16.914 --> 45:20.042
-Baby, we belong together.
-Yeah.

45:20.517 --> 45:23.384
-I want to. Saturday.
-Yeah. Yes!

45:24.988 --> 45:28.219
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, thank you.

45:47.778 --> 45:48.802
Norbit!

45:48.912 --> 45:51.813
Hi. Hey. Good morning, Rasputia.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.611
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

45:54.718 --> 45:56.413
Where the hell you going?

45:58.422 --> 46:01.653
Nowhere special.
I was just gonna go out to...

46:01.759 --> 46:05.195
-I was just going over to Raging Waters.
-Raging Waters?

46:05.295 --> 46:09.322
Yes. It's this thing
I got roped into, darling.

46:09.433 --> 46:12.925
You know, I was at this orphanage
when I was raised, and...

46:13.036 --> 46:14.162
And the people from the orphanage

46:14.271 --> 46:16.296
and now they're taking other orphans
to Raging Waters

46:16.406 --> 46:18.499
so they asked me to come
and give back to the community,

46:18.609 --> 46:21.134
so I'm trying to, you know, do my part.

46:21.245 --> 46:24.009
Little Miss Skinny Bitch gonna be there?

46:24.515 --> 46:26.278
You mean Miss Ling Ling?

46:26.383 --> 46:28.476
You know damn well
I ain't talking about no Miss Ling Ling.

46:28.585 --> 46:30.883
I'm talking about Miss Thing Thing
from that picnic.

46:30.988 --> 46:32.478
Miss Thing Thing from the picnic?

46:32.589 --> 46:34.682
Who are you talking about, sweetheart?
I don't even...

46:34.792 --> 46:39.024
Wait, I think I remember now.
A girl, she had the foreign name.

46:44.001 --> 46:46.697
-Something Russian.
-Kate, bitch!

46:46.804 --> 46:49.932
Kate! Of course it's Kate. Yes,
I don't know if Kate's gonna be there.

46:50.040 --> 46:52.804
I hadn't even thought about it.
It didn't even cross my mind.

46:52.910 --> 46:56.175
I wonder, wilI Kate be there?
Damn good question.

46:56.747 --> 46:58.180
Well, I'm going.

46:58.282 --> 46:59.442
No!

47:00.150 --> 47:00.984
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

47:00.984 --> 47:02.781
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

47:02.886 --> 47:05.878
Who don't like water parks? I love them.
They're just like amusement parks,

47:05.989 --> 47:08.116
except you ain't got to get off the ride
to go to the bathroom.

47:08.225 --> 47:09.522
How you doing?

47:12.429 --> 47:13.453
Great.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.895
There you go. Have fun.

47:18.001 --> 47:20.936
There you go, Brian.
Nick, there's one for you.

47:22.673 --> 47:26.165
all right, kids, everybody please be nice
to Mrs. Latimore, okay?

47:26.276 --> 47:28.676
-Okay.
-Okay.

47:29.046 --> 47:32.880
Kate, I hope you don't mind.
I asked Rasputia to join us.

47:32.983 --> 47:36.146
Of course not.
I'm really glad you could come.

47:36.787 --> 47:40.052
Well, are we gonna stand around here
all day or we gonna go inside?

47:40.157 --> 47:41.317
Excuse me.

47:43.227 --> 47:45.024
Excuse me, ma'am.

47:45.662 --> 47:46.993
What?

47:48.565 --> 47:50.624
Are you wearing bottoms?

47:50.734 --> 47:53.134
Of course I'm wearing bottoms!

47:54.404 --> 47:56.429
Okay. Come on in.

47:56.540 --> 47:58.599
How dare you?

48:04.214 --> 48:06.182
Oh, hell, no.

48:14.358 --> 48:16.952
How you doing!

48:22.366 --> 48:23.492
This ain't like no real beach,

48:23.600 --> 48:26.569
'cause on a real beach you got people
walking around with ice chests

48:26.670 --> 48:30.071
and you can get all kinds of treats
like sandwiches and potato chips

48:30.173 --> 48:33.836
and Mentos and Skittles
and all sorts of delectables.

48:33.944 --> 48:35.673
You can't get shit here!

48:35.779 --> 48:38.805
Well, you know,
there's a concession stand.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.213
You going?

48:40.918 --> 48:42.408
No, I already ate.

48:42.519 --> 48:44.714
Well, you could have fooled me.

48:44.821 --> 48:45.879
I'm sorry?

48:45.989 --> 48:49.015
I'm just trying to say
you too damn skinny. Look at you.

48:49.126 --> 48:52.118
See, most men like a woman
that got a little... Or a little...

48:52.229 --> 48:53.992
You ain't got nothing.
You just skin and bones,

48:54.097 --> 48:56.463
just sitting in that chair
all bones and skin.

48:56.566 --> 48:58.124
I feel sorry for you.

48:58.235 --> 49:01.671
Well, I just feel that we're all made
exactly the way we're supposed to be.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.137
Oh, no. Hell, no. I'm a Christian,

49:03.240 --> 49:06.698
and you ain't gonna sit there
and blame God for how you look, okay?

49:06.810 --> 49:08.641
You the one that
pushed that plate away.

49:08.745 --> 49:10.940
My Norbit is always telling me
there's two kinds of women,

49:11.048 --> 49:13.676
big old good ones
and good old big ones.

49:14.284 --> 49:15.273
Really?

49:15.385 --> 49:17.683
That's right. And, sister, let me tell you,
just between the two of us,

49:17.788 --> 49:18.880
I can't keep Norbit off me.

49:18.989 --> 49:20.752
He is the biggest freak
you ever wanna meet

49:20.857 --> 49:22.381
and he be blowing my back out,

49:22.492 --> 49:24.756
trying to put me
through the headboard every night.

49:24.861 --> 49:26.453
I'm thinking about
going on a little diet or something

49:26.563 --> 49:28.258
so I can get
all emaciated-looking like you,

49:28.365 --> 49:29.696
then he'll think I look disgusting

49:29.800 --> 49:31.768
and I can get a rest
or some sleep for a little while,

49:31.868 --> 49:35.326
because he want it all the time.
Just boom, bam, boom, boom, boom.

49:35.439 --> 49:37.873
But I ain't mad at him, hey.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.840
I'm gonna go on a diet for sure,
next week.

49:39.943 --> 49:42.605
Right now I'm gonna get me
a lamb kabob and a wine cooler.

49:42.713 --> 49:45.978
How you doing?
Where is that wine cooler section?

49:46.917 --> 49:50.409
Miss Thomas, we're all going off
the Leap of Doom. Come on.

49:50.587 --> 49:52.953
Slowly. Slowly.
Someone's gonna fall down.

49:53.056 --> 49:55.684
You're gonna break your head in half
in a second. Slow down!

49:55.792 --> 49:57.020
Wait for me!

49:57.127 --> 50:01.757
I tell you, it sure is tiring chasing these
kids all around the water park, isn't it?

50:01.865 --> 50:04.163
Especially for us skinny folk.

50:04.267 --> 50:05.757
What?

50:05.869 --> 50:07.632
Never mind.

50:09.306 --> 50:12.469
So, Norbit, I have some news.

50:13.477 --> 50:16.105
Deion and l
decided to move up the wedding.

50:16.713 --> 50:17.873
What wedding?

50:17.981 --> 50:19.608
Our wedding.

50:19.916 --> 50:22.680
We're going to get married on Saturday.

50:24.388 --> 50:25.912
You're getting married on Saturday?

50:26.023 --> 50:29.390
Yeah, we just figured, "Why wait?"
You know?

50:33.497 --> 50:37.763
Well... Congratulations, then.

50:38.468 --> 50:39.492
Thanks.

50:39.603 --> 50:41.195
-Yeah.
-I'm really happy.

50:41.304 --> 50:43.670
Oh, so am l. It's wonderful.

50:45.976 --> 50:48.171
So, there it is, the Leap of Doom.

50:48.278 --> 50:50.473
Yeah, go and have fun.
I'll wait for you at the bottom.

50:50.580 --> 50:51.547
You go have some fun.

50:51.648 --> 50:53.309
-Okay.
-Okay.

50:56.853 --> 50:59.185
Okay, kids, one at a time.

51:02.893 --> 51:04.724
I guess this is me.

51:08.198 --> 51:10.530
What are you looking at, Norbit?

51:11.368 --> 51:16.328
I was just watching the... Some kids.
They're about to come down the slide.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.772
I wanted to watch
the kids come down safely.

51:19.042 --> 51:20.634
-Kids, huh?
-Yeah.

51:20.977 --> 51:23.537
So, you wanna watch a bitch
come down a slide?

51:23.647 --> 51:26.081
Well, I'm gonna show you
how a bitch come down a slide.

51:26.183 --> 51:27.741
Oh, no...

51:33.957 --> 51:38.223
Excuse me, ma'am?
We have a 300-pound weight limit.

51:42.132 --> 51:46.796
I don't weigh no damn 300 pounds.
I weigh 165. How you doing?

51:48.738 --> 51:50.603
That was awesome.

51:55.545 --> 51:57.137
What's that?

52:00.584 --> 52:02.108
It's Rasputia.

52:02.719 --> 52:06.018
I'm gonna show you
how a bitch go down a slide.

52:20.203 --> 52:22.103
I'm sliding, bitches!

52:27.244 --> 52:28.939
Mary, Mother of God.

52:29.513 --> 52:31.276
Slow down! Stop! Stop!

52:48.331 --> 52:50.356
How you doing?

52:57.641 --> 52:59.700
Why does she have to go
and get married, Lloyd?

52:59.809 --> 53:01.800
Things were going so well.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.482
There it is.

53:07.884 --> 53:11.183
Hey. Sorry about the concussion.

53:12.222 --> 53:13.553
-It's okay.
-And the whiplash.

53:13.657 --> 53:16.319
-It's okay.
-And the bruised stomach.

53:17.127 --> 53:18.594
And the blood clot.

53:21.164 --> 53:22.529
Nothing.

53:26.236 --> 53:28.397
You know damn welI that's your baby.

53:28.505 --> 53:32.532
You know it's yours. Got the same chin.
The same lip.

53:32.642 --> 53:35.509
That baby got the same head as you
and the same eye...

53:35.612 --> 53:37.978
Go take the test. Take the test.

53:38.081 --> 53:39.605
<i>You want to hear the test resuIts?</i>

53:39.716 --> 53:41.183
ln the case of the little baby...

53:41.284 --> 53:43.309
<i>Well, the test says that is your baby.</i>

53:43.420 --> 53:44.751
How you doing?

53:47.257 --> 53:49.122
Latimore Construction, Norbit speaking.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.818
<i>Hey, Norbit, it's Kate.</i>

53:50.927 --> 53:53.327
<i>Is there any way you can meet me</i>
<i>in town right now?</i>

53:53.430 --> 53:54.590
Yeah, sure.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.028
<i>Great. I'm at McCormick's.</i>

53:56.132 --> 53:57.759
Okay. Fine.

54:03.607 --> 54:07.441
Rasputia, I'm just loaded up
with paperwork up to my ear.

54:07.544 --> 54:10.707
I was wondering, could you run
these permits downtown for me?

54:10.814 --> 54:13.044
Now you tell me
what in the hell I look like,

54:13.149 --> 54:16.414
running some goddamn permits
down to City Hall for your ass.

54:16.519 --> 54:17.621
You do it.

54:17.621 --> 54:17.916
You do it.

54:18.755 --> 54:19.915
Okay.

54:21.324 --> 54:23.189
-What's the surprise?
-No, I'm not telling you.

54:23.293 --> 54:25.921
TelI me. Hey, no, what are you doing?

54:26.029 --> 54:27.724
-Not tilI the last second.
-What? What?

54:27.831 --> 54:30.425
-You ready?
-Yeah, what is it?

54:31.801 --> 54:33.962
I know you don't think
I'm gonna get on that thing.

54:34.070 --> 54:36.300
-I think you're gonna get on that.
-Hey, no way. Hey.

54:36.406 --> 54:39.102
Come on! Look where you wanna go.
You're doing great.

54:39.209 --> 54:43.009
You got it? You got it? You got it?

54:43.113 --> 54:45.206
Watch out for the fence!

54:47.350 --> 54:48.681
And the mailbox.

54:50.353 --> 54:53.379
Rasputia, the painters from
the Crestview site got food poisoning.

54:53.490 --> 54:55.390
There's vomit everywhere!

54:55.492 --> 54:58.290
You know damn well
you clean up all the vomit. You do it!

54:58.395 --> 55:01.421
-I don't feel safe.
-Yeah! You're doing great!

55:04.534 --> 55:05.762
Yeah.

55:08.438 --> 55:11.532
The Portosans at Drummond's
tipped over!

55:11.641 --> 55:13.541
Well, go clean the shit up!

55:25.155 --> 55:26.520
Rasputia?

55:41.071 --> 55:42.402
You do it!

55:43.873 --> 55:45.534
-I got it!
-Go!

55:45.642 --> 55:48.770
I'm getting it! I'm doing it!

55:48.878 --> 55:50.277
You're doing it! Yeah, but slow down!

55:50.380 --> 55:53.372
-How?
-With the brakes! The brakes!

55:58.888 --> 56:00.378
Oh, no. Are you okay?

56:00.490 --> 56:03.584
Yeah. Actually, that was kind of fun.

56:04.961 --> 56:07.623
-Come on.
-Okay, help me.

56:07.731 --> 56:09.858
-Okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

56:12.702 --> 56:16.536
So, I'm going to Giovanni's tonight
to choose the food for the reception.

56:16.639 --> 56:19.608
You wanna come? Help me decide?

56:19.709 --> 56:21.506
What about Deion?

56:22.679 --> 56:25.113
I just don't trust him with food.

56:25.215 --> 56:27.615
You know,
he made dinner for us the other night.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.912
It tasted like cheap take-out.

56:34.391 --> 56:35.688
-Well, I'll go.
-Good.

56:35.792 --> 56:39.694
Well, I just have to go get my dress,
and then we can meet, say, at 7:00?

56:39.829 --> 56:41.057
Okay, that's great.

56:41.164 --> 56:43.962
-Perfect, Norbit.
-Okay, see you at 7:00.

56:45.635 --> 56:46.659
Norbit!

56:46.770 --> 56:48.260
all right. Yeah, Norby.

56:48.371 --> 56:50.305
7:00, don't be late.

56:50.974 --> 56:53.238
You guys are all pervs.

56:55.445 --> 56:56.810
I love it.

56:58.815 --> 57:00.112
What's wrong?

57:00.617 --> 57:02.744
Are you sure we're not rushing things?

57:02.852 --> 57:07.050
I know we're not. I know we're not.
I couldn't be happier.

57:09.192 --> 57:10.853
Norbit, that's a date.

57:10.960 --> 57:13.292
No, it's not. She just wants someone...

57:13.396 --> 57:16.194
Are you paying for this encounter
this evening?

57:16.299 --> 57:17.288
Of course not!

57:17.400 --> 57:21.131
Then that's a date.
Don't be trying to tell a pimp his game.

57:22.172 --> 57:23.764
Come on, baby.

57:26.509 --> 57:28.136
-Thank you.
-Carmen, honey!

57:28.244 --> 57:29.711
all right.

57:32.081 --> 57:34.242
Well, who are you getting all fine for?

57:34.350 --> 57:37.217
Hello, Rasputia. Well, that's nice.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.254
Oh, yeah, right.
Why you trying to look all extra today?

57:39.355 --> 57:42.882
Oh, I'm just, you know, being a girl.

57:45.662 --> 57:48.688
My fiancé likes it
when I take care of myself.

57:48.798 --> 57:50.823
Look to me like
that fish already in his net.

57:50.934 --> 57:53.164
You look like
you fixing to catch you a new fish.

57:53.269 --> 57:57.103
What? No. God. Don't be silly.

57:58.041 --> 58:00.271
You're married. You're here.

58:00.376 --> 58:01.934
I don't do this for my husband.

58:02.045 --> 58:04.707
Girl, I do this
because I have a reputation to uphold.

58:04.814 --> 58:08.841
Everybody in this town know that
Rasputia Latimore is fine. Ain't I fine?

58:08.952 --> 58:10.886
-You fine, girl! You are fine.
-Sister!

58:10.987 --> 58:12.181
Everybody knows.

58:12.288 --> 58:15.223
But even a delicate flower like me
need a little water from time to time.

58:15.325 --> 58:17.691
Or a little lye in her kitchen
to help straighten out them petaIs.

58:17.794 --> 58:19.022
How you doing?

58:19.128 --> 58:20.356
Rasputia.

58:20.463 --> 58:22.431
Helga waiting on you, girl,
to do your bikini wax.

58:22.532 --> 58:23.760
Here I come, girl.

58:23.867 --> 58:27.132
I got to go, girl. Every now and then
I got to mow the lawn.

58:27.270 --> 58:31.036
You just make sure
all that sprucing up is for your fiancé.

58:33.510 --> 58:36.206
Helga, here I come, girl.
It's a fulI moon, too.

58:40.083 --> 58:41.880
Here we go, dear.

58:48.858 --> 58:51.418
I was looking for Norbit's police whistle.

58:51.794 --> 58:52.886
Go fish.

58:53.663 --> 58:54.630
What's up?

58:54.731 --> 58:56.665
Everything on schedule
with the wedding?

58:56.766 --> 58:58.757
I got my own problems, but I'll handle it.

58:58.868 --> 59:00.563
What's this situation
you're talking about?

59:00.670 --> 59:02.638
The liquor license on the orphanage.

59:02.739 --> 59:05.606
It won't rolI over
when the property changes hands,

59:05.708 --> 59:08.040
not without one of
these transfer requests upfront.

59:08.144 --> 59:10.476
Yeah, and getting a new license
could take years.

59:10.580 --> 59:13.276
Yeah, we'd be out of business
before we get started.

59:13.383 --> 59:15.044
You think you can get Kate to sign that?

59:15.151 --> 59:17.813
Hell, no. She's planning on
closing the restaurant.

59:17.921 --> 59:19.548
It'd raise too many suspicions.

59:19.656 --> 59:21.851
all right, smart-ass,
then what we gonna do now?

59:21.958 --> 59:24.392
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

59:27.897 --> 59:28.886
Norbit.

59:31.167 --> 59:33.567
-Where you going, Norbit?
-Sit your punk ass down.

59:33.670 --> 59:37.766
Guys, I told Rasputia
the toilet needed to be reinforced

59:37.874 --> 59:39.466
and she said
that I should take care of it,

59:39.576 --> 59:40.770
so I'm gonna go take care of that.

59:40.877 --> 59:41.935
Forget that.

59:42.045 --> 59:43.706
I can't. No, guys,
it's an accident waiting to happen.

59:43.813 --> 59:45.781
-I have to deaI with it.
-I said forget that.

59:45.882 --> 59:47.474
We need you to
get these papers signed tonight.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.573
Oh, no. I can't do it tonight, guys.

59:48.685 --> 59:50.744
There's an accident waiting to happen.
I have to deaI with this...

59:50.853 --> 59:53.481
Norbit, if you don't
get these papers signed tonight,

59:53.590 --> 59:55.353
we can't start
the remodeI on the orphanage.

59:55.458 --> 59:56.482
That's right, punk ass.

59:56.593 --> 59:59.153
BulIshit. I'm going for mine tonight.
I got things to do!

59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.321
Norbit, you better find that Kate Thomas

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.796
and get her to sign.

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.059
Yeah.

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.160
Kate Thomas?

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.965
You want me to get these papers
to Kate Thomas?

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.266
Yeah.

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:11.662
Okay, that's more important.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.969
I'll take care of this for you guys.
I'll get these to Kate Thomas.

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:16.602
-That's what I told you to do.
-Get your punk ass up.

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.975
Okay, I'm gonna go take these to Kate

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:20.106
and take my punk ass to Kate Thomas
right now.

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:22.081
Excuse me, pardon me.
Let me get through here. Thank you.

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.676
-Excuse me. Going through. Hi.
-Bitch ass.

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.381
Yes, I am a bitch ass. Excuse me.
Kate Thomas.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.026
Hey, sorry I'm late.

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.695
Man, it's time for
a pimpallcious makeover. Let's do this.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:37.288
all right. But nothing too flashy now.
I wanna be flashy, but not...

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.391
Class. I don't want no....

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.609
Now, that's pimping.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.208
all right, hair's bigger.

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:19.700
Okay. Well, I guess this is it, guys.
Thanks a lot for all your help.

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.634
Thanks for making me fly.

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.939
You fly like a flock of birds, baby.

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:26.645
-You look good.
-Thanks, guys.

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:30.446
-Handle this business for us, brother.
-I'm gonna handle it. Gonna handle it.

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.416
-Do the walk, Norbit.
-I got you.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.513
Yeah. Norbit!

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.389
Wow, Norbit!

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.165
I just picked these
on the side of the road,

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:50.899
'cause this is just a casuaI get-together.

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:54.943
Sure. And you put the wires
up the stems, too. That's a nice touch.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.610
-Norbit!
-Hey, Sam.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.382
You dressed to kill, huh?

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:05.454
Katerina, you look beautiful.
Come sit, please.

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.715
I'm making my speciaIty just for you.

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:13.091
Hey. Did you make my favorite?

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.993
What do you think, huh?

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:18.893
I'm gonna take the flowers,
put them into water, okay?

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.926
He's a nice man.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.331
Your favorite?

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.806
I guess you and Rasputia
come here a lot, huh?

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.605
Oh, no. We used to,
but she got banned for life

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.771
because Sam had
an all-you-can-eat buffet once

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:35.874
and she took it as a personaI challenge,
and it got pretty ugly.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.519
I wanna make a toast.

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:39.918
Oh, sure.

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.657
To old friends.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.729
To old friends.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:52.025
We were buddy partners, all right,
Norbit. We were.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:57.038
I tell you, you know,

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:01.440
sometimes I think
I should've never married Rasputia.

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.708
What do you mean, Norbit?

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:07.078
I was just really young, you know,
and she latched on to me

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:11.449
and kind of helped me fit in
and gave me a family, so...

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:15.054
We had nobody, Norbit.

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:18.616
I mean, who can blame us
for wanting to feel safe, you know?

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.627
Yeah, safe.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.928
Like you and Deion?

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:26.527
Yeah.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:33.440
I mean,
it's different with Deion, obviously.

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:38.608
So, what have you got here?

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:41.410
Those are just construction papers,

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:44.042
permits and stuff that you have to sign.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.780
Kate, can I ask you
a personaI question?

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:50.483
Sure, what?

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.860
Do you love Deion?

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:01.897
Of course. Yeah.

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:07.865
Otherwise,
why would I be marrying him, right?

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:10.703
Right?

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:17.244
-Got your pizza.
-It is about time.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.687
I'm about to disappear up in here
I'm so hungry.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.621
Norbit out draining a swamp
or something.

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:27.992
Yeah, he's definitely draining a swamp.
He's draining a swamp like he would be.

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:35.566
-Why you looking at me like that?
-Where's Norbit?

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:39.801
Draining a swamp.
And why are you looking at me like that?

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:44.510
He's out there in the woods,
draining a swamp. I told you before.

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:48.642
I don't know nothing.

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:52.247
I don't know nothing, okay?

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:01.723
He's on a date with that fine skinny girl!

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.602
It's pain time here! I ain't having this!

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:18.611
Oh, hell, no. And on top of that
he been messing with my seat again?

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.375
Damn it, Norbit!

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.819
He got me destroying my shit.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.597
This is it.

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.760
It's always so beautifuI in here.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:42.828
Peaceful.

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:45.371
-Hello, Kate, Norbit.
-Hey.

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:48.875
Didn't know anybody was here.
I was getting ready to close up shop.

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:52.709
You know, Kate,
this all happened so fast,

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:56.080
I reallzed we never had
a chance to rehearse.

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:57.914
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.112
So, come on up here.

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:01.689
Let me at least show you
where you're gonna stand.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.383
-Come on.
-all right.

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:09.563
Rasputia. You know
you no allowed in here.

01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:11.860
The hell with that. Where's Norbit?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:15.233
I don't see Norbit.
Anybody is a see Norbit?

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.771
-No.
-He hasn't been here.

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:21.673
Then who was eating a turkey ass?

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:25.273
Run! Run! Run!

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.679
At which point
you'll give your vows to Deion.

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:32.649
You want to practice those?

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:37.688
Well, I hadn't actually gotten to that
quite yet.

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:40.020
You don't even know
what you're gonna say yet?

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:44.123
Well, what would you say, Norbit?
I don't know.

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.066
What would I say?

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.430
Norbit!

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.812
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was hot like me</i>

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:03.010
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was a freak like me</i>

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.086
<i>Don't cha</i>

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.015
What would I say if I was saying vows?

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:09.021
I guess...

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.218
Kate,

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:14.853
I think about you all day long.

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:19.495
And when I'm not near you,

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.435
all I think about is being near you.

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:24.233
And when you are near me,

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.002
I feel like I'm at peace
with the whole world.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.111
I know that...

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.611
I know I'll never have to
ask God for anything

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:37.015
'cause, as long as I have you in my life,

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:40.520
I got everything I ever wanted.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.723
And the only thing
I really wanna do is just

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:51.698
spend the rest of my life making you
as happy as you've made me.

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:55.570
Because I love you, Kate.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.432
I love you.

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:03.878
I don't know. Something like that.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.008
And after the vows you would then...

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:10.007
Okay.

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.185
Oh, my God.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.917
I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:48.051
I'm sorry.

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:58.866
-Awkward.
-Yeah.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.837
Give me that crowbar.
I got some killing to do.

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:22.917
Damn it!

01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:27.322
I'm a Christian. You got me
up in this church cursing, Norbit.

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:31.827
Death do us part, huh? Okay, Norbit.

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.060
Look like you done moved up
the goddamn schedule.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.728
I'm cursing again.

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:36.995
Pray, bitch, pray.

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.733
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:42.332
Thy kingdom come, thy wilI be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:45.970
Kate, please. Kate, please, I'm sorry.

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:47.274
Kate, please, stop and talk to me.

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.247
Please, please, Kate.
Talk to me, please.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.113
I can't, Norbit.

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.283
I'm just too confused right now.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:56.847
I'm sorry. It was all my fauIt.
I never should have kissed you.

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:58.960
No.

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.424
I wanted you to.

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:08.228
That's why I'm so confused.

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.297
Good night.

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:25.180
She wanted me to.

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:37.460
-Where the papers at, Norbit?
-Got them for you right here.

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:46.273
I'd hate to be you right now.

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:47.776
Why?

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.674
Go on in the house.

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:52.678
Go on in.

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:58.615
Go ahead, fool. What you waiting for?

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.348
Get on in.

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.259
Hello?

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:20.103
Chocolate drop, I'm home.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.976
Lollipop?

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:27.041
Mail.

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.520
Expecting a letter, Norbit?

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:40.319
You frightened me.
No, I was just looking through.

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.726
How was your date?

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:44.594
Date?

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:49.135
That was no date. That was just...

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:53.868
I just was over at
what's-her-name's wedding rehearsal.

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:58.576
That's all. It wasn't a date, though.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.382
Oh, really?

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.865
Lloyd. Is that you, Lloyd?

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:26.000
Lloyd, what am I gonna do?

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.202
KilI the bitch.

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:30.669
Excuse me? What'd you say?

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:35.443
You heard me. Rub her out.
Take her down. lce the bitch.

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:39.345
Hey. Lloyd, you're talking.

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:43.186
She took my legs, Norbit.
She took my legs.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:46.261
You know what it's like to be a dog
with no legs?

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.159
I can't raise one up to pee.

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:53.166
Hell, I can't even hump no more, Norbit.
Humping was my thing.

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:55.498
What is this, Norbit?

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:01.776
Some kind of weird, satanic potato art?

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:04.774
What's this?

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.440
It looks like the acid
that we use down at the quarry.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:08.675
Right!

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:11.480
But this is
Miss Pretty Little Thang's little face.

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:15.751
And, Norbit, if you ever see her again,
if you ever talk to her again,

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:18.190
if you ever so much
as think about the bitch again,

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:20.853
this is what's gonna happen to her.

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.561
How you doing?

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:31.666
You get the picture, Norbit?

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:36.409
Deion, I just think that
we need to take a beat.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.742
It's not you, it's me.

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:41.577
Just if we slow down, l...

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:43.514
Oh, good, you're up.

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:46.417
-Deion, we need to talk.
-Yes, we do.

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:49.582
I was just at Latimore Construction,
you know, with the renovation plans,

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:52.125
and I found this on Big Black's desk.

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:53.786
What is it?

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:56.228
It's a request to renew
the Golden Wonton's liquor license

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.925
and put it in the Latimores' name.

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:00.726
What?

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:03.304
Baby, you signed it yesterday.
Look at the date.

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:05.805
No. No, I didn't sign anything.

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:10.409
Just some permits
that Norbit gave me, but...

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.776
Well, did you read them?

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.708
-No.
-No. Great.

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:17.285
I don't get it, though, Deion.

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:19.411
Why would the Latimores
want me to renew the liquor license

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.749
at the orphanage?

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:22.585
Baby, people say
they've been trying to get their hands on

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.921
that orphanage for years.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.928
Apparently they want to turn it
into a strip joint.

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:29.491
Disgusting.

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:32.698
First you gonna clean the basement,
then you gonna clean the garage,

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.769
then you gonna go upstairs
and clean the attic.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.997
We don't even have an attic.

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:40.632
Well, then you build a damn attic, then,
Norbit! And then clean it!

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:43.609
I'm going upstairs to take a bubble bath.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:51.684
Bitch! You bitch!

01:14:53.917 --> 01:14:55.544
Finally.

01:14:55.652 --> 01:14:59.952
I needed this.
Let me submerge this ass.

01:15:00.057 --> 01:15:01.922
How you doing?

01:15:05.262 --> 01:15:06.889
Good and hot.

01:15:07.431 --> 01:15:09.899
Sounds like it's raining outside.

01:15:20.544 --> 01:15:21.670
Oh, no.

01:15:22.479 --> 01:15:23.673
Kate!

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.747
Norbit.

01:15:24.848 --> 01:15:27.043
Over here. Over here.

01:15:28.218 --> 01:15:29.776
I need to talk to you.

01:15:29.886 --> 01:15:33.049
Do you know what was in those papers
you had me sign last night?

01:15:33.156 --> 01:15:35.021
Yeah, the construction permits.

01:15:35.125 --> 01:15:37.252
No, that's not all.

01:15:40.897 --> 01:15:42.125
Norbit.

01:15:42.432 --> 01:15:46.095
Hey, just... Just go away, Kate!
Get out of here!

01:15:46.203 --> 01:15:47.363
What?

01:15:49.573 --> 01:15:52.167
You heard what I said!
Just get out of here! Scram!

01:15:52.275 --> 01:15:55.972
The Latimores are trying to
take controI of the orphanage, Norbit.

01:15:56.079 --> 01:16:00.140
Well, why don't you go and find
somebody who gives a rat's ass,

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:02.810
because I sure as hell don't!

01:16:03.386 --> 01:16:06.480
-You don't care?
-No, I don't care.

01:16:08.058 --> 01:16:10.925
-And I don't care about you, either!
-Norbit.

01:16:11.027 --> 01:16:14.758
The only woman I have ever,
ever loved and ever cared about

01:16:14.865 --> 01:16:18.392
was my darling wife, Rasputia!

01:16:20.604 --> 01:16:21.628
But last night...

01:16:21.738 --> 01:16:26.266
Last night I was just trying to naiI you,
you know, score?

01:16:26.743 --> 01:16:28.904
But now I reallze I don't have to do that!

01:16:29.012 --> 01:16:34.575
all I need is my beautiful,
precious wife Rasputia!

01:16:35.519 --> 01:16:39.956
She's all the woman I need, so
you can just go on and get out of here,

01:16:40.056 --> 01:16:42.547
you screwy dame! Who needs you?

01:16:43.593 --> 01:16:45.493
Damn, Norbit.

01:16:45.595 --> 01:16:48.792
Did that skinny little thing
figure out your plan?

01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:52.460
Girl, you just don't get it, do you?
Norbit played you.

01:16:52.569 --> 01:16:54.867
You got her to sign those papers,
didn't you?

01:16:54.971 --> 01:16:56.666
Yes, darling.

01:16:57.574 --> 01:16:59.235
He been setting you up
from that moment

01:16:59.342 --> 01:17:01.435
from the very first day you got here.

01:17:01.545 --> 01:17:02.910
How you doing?

01:17:03.847 --> 01:17:06.714
Don't you ever talk to me again!

01:17:08.151 --> 01:17:09.209
Kate.

01:17:09.319 --> 01:17:12.015
Damn, Norbit,
you pissing off everybody today.

01:17:12.122 --> 01:17:17.355
Don't you ever talk to me again!
Don't you ever talk to me again!

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.058
Never again!

01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:54.761
Hey, Norbit.

01:17:56.299 --> 01:17:58.563
Mr. Wong,
what are you doing around here?

01:17:58.668 --> 01:18:02.399
I just going for a walk, Norbit.
Just going for a walk.

01:18:02.505 --> 01:18:06.134
I live in this neighborhood long time.
Long time.

01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:09.103
Soon I be moving on.

01:18:09.212 --> 01:18:11.737
Yes, as I look around this neighborhood,

01:18:11.848 --> 01:18:15.375
I reallze there
no good dry cleaners here.

01:18:15.485 --> 01:18:17.180
I could make killing.

01:18:17.287 --> 01:18:18.652
Why you got suitcase?

01:18:18.755 --> 01:18:21.815
I'm getting the H out of here.
I'm leaving town for good.

01:18:21.925 --> 01:18:23.051
What? Leaving town?

01:18:23.159 --> 01:18:26.424
I thought you stick around,
help Kate run orphanage.

01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:28.555
She's getting married
to Deion tomorrow,

01:18:28.665 --> 01:18:31.156
so there's no reason
for me to stay around here.

01:18:31.268 --> 01:18:32.758
No reason?

01:18:32.936 --> 01:18:34.597
No, she won't even see me.

01:18:34.704 --> 01:18:37.002
And besides,
I'll just wind up getting hurt again.

01:18:37.107 --> 01:18:40.440
Norbit, you listen to me.
You very speciaI to me.

01:18:41.244 --> 01:18:45.408
I love you like my own child,
like boy child, not girI child.

01:18:45.515 --> 01:18:47.881
Wong once have girI child
back in Shanghai.

01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:50.509
When she two years old,
I trade her for yak.

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.180
That sort of thing happen in China
from time to time.

01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:54.951
Yak very hard to come by.

01:18:55.058 --> 01:18:57.788
Oh, yeah, sure. I appreciate that.

01:18:57.894 --> 01:19:00.761
You can't run
from your problems, Norbit.

01:19:00.864 --> 01:19:04.800
Black people run fast,
but problem even faster.

01:19:05.435 --> 01:19:07.027
That's kind of racist.

01:19:07.137 --> 01:19:11.267
Yes. Wong very racist. I no like black.
I no like Jew either.

01:19:11.374 --> 01:19:14.138
But black and Jew love Chinese food.
Go figure.

01:19:15.045 --> 01:19:17.479
Always remember two things, Norbit.

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:22.040
One, even though you're very ugly,

01:19:22.152 --> 01:19:24.985
you're very strong inside, like warrior.

01:19:25.088 --> 01:19:29.388
And two, maiI come late on Friday.

01:19:31.227 --> 01:19:33.388
Wong Dry Cleaning.

01:19:34.197 --> 01:19:35.960
It could have been huge.

01:19:36.066 --> 01:19:39.729
You don't even have to clean nothing,
you just spray with starch.

01:20:00.123 --> 01:20:01.283
Mr...

01:20:06.363 --> 01:20:08.228
I gotta warn Kate.

01:20:16.906 --> 01:20:17.930
<i>Hello?</i>

01:20:18.041 --> 01:20:20.134
Hello, Kate. Kate, it's Norbit.
I have to talk to you.

01:20:20.243 --> 01:20:23.644
<i>-Please don't call me anymore.</i>
-No, Kate, it's very important.

01:20:25.248 --> 01:20:26.579
Kate?

01:20:39.696 --> 01:20:40.924
Going somewhere, Norbit?

01:20:41.031 --> 01:20:43.363
No, I was... No.

01:20:43.466 --> 01:20:45.127
What did I tell you
about leaving this house?

01:20:45.235 --> 01:20:47.703
I was just going to get some fresh air.

01:20:47.804 --> 01:20:50.398
Boy, you ain't going nowhere
tilI after that wedding's done.

01:20:50.507 --> 01:20:52.134
We got too much riding on that.

01:20:52.242 --> 01:20:54.210
What do you have
riding on the wedding?

01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:56.505
Soon as your little friend says, "I do,"

01:20:56.613 --> 01:20:59.878
Deion and us is gonna
turn the orphanage into a titty bar.

01:21:00.216 --> 01:21:02.446
But what about the little orphans?

01:21:02.552 --> 01:21:05.612
Hell, they can come too,
if they pay the cover.

01:21:07.857 --> 01:21:10.690
John the Baptist, stop their eviI plan.

01:21:11.494 --> 01:21:13.519
Get your ass down in the basement.

01:21:14.064 --> 01:21:15.588
Get down there!

01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:26.204
It's a madhouse! A madhouse!

01:21:42.392 --> 01:21:45.020
-Come on, Rasputia! We gonna be late.
-Yeah.

01:21:45.128 --> 01:21:47.062
I know y'all better stop rushing me.

01:21:47.163 --> 01:21:49.631
Beauty takes time.
This don't just happen.

01:21:49.732 --> 01:21:50.994
Oh, no.

01:21:51.301 --> 01:21:52.268
You get out the car.

01:21:52.368 --> 01:21:52.735
You gonna stay here
and make sure Norbit don't go no place.

01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:54.168
You gonna stay here
and make sure Norbit don't go no place.

01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:56.795
What? Why I gotta stay?

01:21:56.906 --> 01:21:59.374
Because everybody know
you the smartest.

01:22:16.292 --> 01:22:19.887
Three minutes to show time.
Not too late to chicken out.

01:22:20.563 --> 01:22:22.360
No, I'm ready.

01:22:22.665 --> 01:22:24.929
Okay. You look beautiful.

01:22:43.453 --> 01:22:45.853
<i>P-O-W-E-R.</i>

01:22:45.955 --> 01:22:50.153
<i>T to the A to the mother-stanking P.</i>
<i>Power-tap the fat, move back.</i>

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.057
<i>Power-tap the fat, move back.</i>

01:23:11.514 --> 01:23:13.072
What are the Latimores doing here?

01:23:13.183 --> 01:23:16.482
Don't worry. It's your day.
You look beautiful.

01:23:25.962 --> 01:23:27.224
Nuts.

01:23:27.797 --> 01:23:30.391
<i>-Tap, tap, tap. Tap it off.</i>
-Tap, tap. Tap...

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.328
Norbit!

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:36.734
Norbit? Norbit?

01:23:38.708 --> 01:23:40.608
Oh, damn. He escaped.

01:23:41.444 --> 01:23:43.275
Norbit! Norbit!

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.339
Your ass is mine, Norbit!

01:23:55.925 --> 01:23:57.222
Yeah.

01:24:01.831 --> 01:24:03.856
-Just now? Shit.
-Is he all right?

01:24:04.267 --> 01:24:06.497
Norbit escaped. He gonna be
headed this way. Come on.

01:24:06.603 --> 01:24:08.070
Hell, no.

01:24:11.808 --> 01:24:14.242
-Norbit is coming.
-For shizzle?

01:24:14.344 --> 01:24:16.505
We have to figure out way
to stall wedding.

01:24:16.613 --> 01:24:17.944
Just calm down, Mr. Wong.

01:24:18.047 --> 01:24:21.278
I've ruined plenty of weddings
back in the day. I got this.

01:24:21.884 --> 01:24:23.715
Dearly beloved,

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.916
we are gathered here today
to join these two in holy matrimony.

01:24:28.024 --> 01:24:30.720
Your Honor, I object!

01:24:31.394 --> 01:24:34.886
Object? Sir, we've not gotten to
that part yet.

01:24:34.998 --> 01:24:38.866
Then I'm objeculating prematurely,
Reverend.

01:24:40.403 --> 01:24:43.770
No offense, my brother, but we're just
trying to keep the train rolling here.

01:24:43.873 --> 01:24:47.206
Oh, well, if you want to
get the train rolling, you know...

01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:49.471
You got to use the big "L".

01:24:50.813 --> 01:24:51.837
Lesbians.

01:24:51.948 --> 01:24:54.109
No, man.
I ain't talking about no lesbians.

01:24:54.217 --> 01:24:55.775
-AIthough, late at night.
-Yes.

01:24:55.885 --> 01:24:57.409
-Right?
-Yes.

01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:00.521
-No, brother, we talking about love.
-Love.

01:25:00.623 --> 01:25:06.255
Love is the engine
that drives the train forward, backwards,

01:25:06.362 --> 01:25:11.129
side to side,
round and round love does go.

01:25:11.234 --> 01:25:13.794
You understand me? I got this, brother.

01:25:13.903 --> 01:25:18.340
I'm not talking about no $20 up in here,
back seat of the car,

01:25:18.441 --> 01:25:20.409
stanky-stanky, hanky-panky.

01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:21.477
-No.
-No.

01:25:21.577 --> 01:25:23.977
I'm talking about good, wholesome,

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.072
fortified with
eight essentiaI vitamins love.

01:25:27.183 --> 01:25:28.616
That cost anywhere...

01:25:28.718 --> 01:25:29.707
How much it cost?

01:25:29.819 --> 01:25:33.880
About $136, Monday through Fridays.
$212 on the weekends.

01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:36.823
Because of inflation.
Can I get an "Amen"?

01:25:36.926 --> 01:25:38.018
Amen!

01:25:48.338 --> 01:25:50.238
Where the hell you going, Norbit?

01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:53.366
None of your GD beeswax, Rasputia!

01:25:53.476 --> 01:25:55.467
Look at you, you old stupid fool.
You can't even ride a bike.

01:25:55.578 --> 01:25:58.570
Oh, yes, I can, because Kate taught me!

01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:12.222
Brothers and sisters.
This particular one's for the brothers.

01:26:12.328 --> 01:26:16.025
When you buy the ones that say,
"Ribbed for her pleasure,"

01:26:16.132 --> 01:26:20.728
turn them inside out
and they ribbed for your pleasure.

01:26:20.837 --> 01:26:23.067
-Can I get an "Amen"?
-Amen!

01:26:23.172 --> 01:26:25.663
Now, speaking of ribs and pleasure.

01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:30.578
Yes. For a limited time only,
we are proud to present to you

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.877
our barbeque, baby back, horseradish,

01:26:33.983 --> 01:26:36.918
mustard and
peanut butter-encrusted ribs

01:26:37.019 --> 01:26:41.718
with a slight Jagermeister infusion
sprinkled with chamomile leaves

01:26:41.824 --> 01:26:46.523
with a horseradish
and dandelion salad on a bed of rice.

01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:49.723
Buy one Pimp Platter,
get the whole bones free.

01:26:49.866 --> 01:26:52.858
No, no, no! That's enough talking.

01:26:52.969 --> 01:26:54.903
It's time to get back to the wedding.

01:26:55.004 --> 01:26:59.634
It ain't never enough talking
when you talking about love, brother.

01:26:59.742 --> 01:27:01.937
-Ain't that right?
-Yeah!

01:27:02.044 --> 01:27:03.602
Let me hear you say it, people!

01:27:03.713 --> 01:27:04.737
Love!

01:27:04.847 --> 01:27:06.872
Let me hear you sing it, choir!

01:27:06.983 --> 01:27:09.076
<i>Love!</i>

01:27:21.664 --> 01:27:23.188
-I'm gonna rip your head off.
-Rasputia.

01:27:23.299 --> 01:27:24.698
-What?
-Car!

01:27:24.801 --> 01:27:26.496
I don't give a damn about no car.
I'm ready to die.

01:27:26.602 --> 01:27:27.967
Car!

01:27:29.939 --> 01:27:31.964
I'm ready to die!

01:27:33.443 --> 01:27:34.467
I'm ready to die.

01:27:34.577 --> 01:27:37.375
I ain't gonna let you ruin Nipplopolis
for me, boy! Damn!

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.471
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die up in here.

01:27:39.916 --> 01:27:41.508
Drive the car, God damn it!

01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:51.786
What's up, white man?
Pay for your sins. Pay for your sins.

01:27:52.061 --> 01:27:54.359
We gonna change your name to Leroy.

01:28:50.887 --> 01:28:52.752
Amen!

01:28:57.126 --> 01:28:58.252
That's enough!

01:28:58.361 --> 01:29:01.660
That's enough! Enough! Enough!
Enough! Enough!

01:29:01.931 --> 01:29:03.694
-Stop the music!
-Hold on.

01:29:03.833 --> 01:29:06.165
Shut up! You two, shut up!

01:29:06.269 --> 01:29:08.100
That's it. This is husband-and-wife time.

01:29:08.204 --> 01:29:11.833
Now, let's go. Let's go.
Husband-and-wife stuff.

01:29:13.943 --> 01:29:14.910
Dearly beloved,

01:29:15.912 --> 01:29:17.140
we are gathered here today...

01:29:17.246 --> 01:29:18.543
I object!

01:29:18.648 --> 01:29:20.013
Oh, for Christ's sake!

01:29:20.449 --> 01:29:21.939
-Norbit.
-Norbit.

01:29:22.051 --> 01:29:23.040
Norbit.

01:29:23.152 --> 01:29:25.950
<i>Norbit</i>

01:29:26.722 --> 01:29:29.418
This wedding is a sham
and I'm here to stop it.

01:29:29.525 --> 01:29:31.493
Norbit, what are you doing?

01:29:31.594 --> 01:29:35.257
I'm being a man
for the first time in my life. Kate...

01:29:36.098 --> 01:29:38.032
Kate, I love you.

01:29:39.602 --> 01:29:41.934
What the hell did you just say?

01:29:43.339 --> 01:29:46.069
You heard what I said, strumpet.
I love Kate!

01:29:46.175 --> 01:29:48.473
That's right. I love you, Kate.

01:29:48.578 --> 01:29:51.911
And the last two weeks I spent with you
have meant more to me

01:29:52.014 --> 01:29:54.847
than my whole entire miserable life
with you, Rasputia!

01:29:54.951 --> 01:30:00.082
It's over! Norbit Albert Rice
is no longer your bitch!

01:30:05.161 --> 01:30:06.526
You're dead! Get off me!

01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:08.221
Get your hands off me, Black.
Don't go hitting me.

01:30:08.331 --> 01:30:10.561
What's wrong with you, girl?
What's wrong with you? Get off of me.

01:30:10.666 --> 01:30:11.826
You don't talk like that with me.

01:30:11.934 --> 01:30:12.901
No, wait!

01:30:13.002 --> 01:30:14.264
No, no, wait, baby girl,
he's ruining our wedding.

01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:15.667
Let's just get back to the nuptiaIs.

01:30:15.771 --> 01:30:18.467
We just heard condom advice
from an ex-pimp.

01:30:18.574 --> 01:30:21.168
I think we can survive
a few words from Norbit.

01:30:21.277 --> 01:30:24.269
Deion is a fake. He's marrying you
just to get your money.

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.369
What?

01:30:25.481 --> 01:30:28.575
Him and the Latimores.
They thought this whole scheme up.

01:30:28.684 --> 01:30:31.847
He's been married four times in the
last six years to four different women,

01:30:31.954 --> 01:30:34.980
and he cheated the women
out of $300,000 in divorce settlements.

01:30:35.091 --> 01:30:36.854
Yeah, I heard all about it!
And something eIse.

01:30:36.959 --> 01:30:39.154
They were gonna try to steal
the orphanage from you.

01:30:39.261 --> 01:30:40.489
That's what this whole thing is about!

01:30:40.596 --> 01:30:43.759
You crazy! He's got a big crush on you.
He's making this stuff up.

01:30:43.866 --> 01:30:45.663
Oh, yeah? I'm crazy?
I'm making it all up?

01:30:45.768 --> 01:30:47.998
-Yes, you making it up.
-Then what about this, then?

01:30:48.104 --> 01:30:50.800
This evidence that I have.
Look at this!

01:30:52.208 --> 01:30:54.142
This, well...

01:30:54.343 --> 01:30:57.938
This used to, before it felI in the pond,
it had numbers

01:30:58.047 --> 01:30:59.514
and there was information.

01:30:59.615 --> 01:31:02.709
There was people's names
and dates and addresses

01:31:02.818 --> 01:31:05.412
and all kinds of incriminating things.

01:31:05.521 --> 01:31:09.821
I felI in the pond, but you can't read it.
But, boy, did I have your ass!

01:31:10.059 --> 01:31:13.426
That's nice, Norbit. Really nice.
Did you write that yourself? Pathetic.

01:31:13.529 --> 01:31:15.087
Kate, you have to believe me.

01:31:15.197 --> 01:31:16.425
Yeah, yeah, believe him, Kate.

01:31:16.532 --> 01:31:18.966
Remember the one that got you to sign
the papers to steaI the orphanage?

01:31:19.068 --> 01:31:21.298
Remember that?
Believe him. Go ahead.

01:31:21.804 --> 01:31:26.241
I'm so sorry, Norbit.
I just don't trust you anymore.

01:31:31.313 --> 01:31:34.339
Well, well, well, Norbit. You lose again.

01:31:34.450 --> 01:31:38.318
Once a loser, always a loser, huh?
Now, come on! Let's go!

01:31:39.822 --> 01:31:43.519
Yeah, I thought you'd feel
that way about it, Kate.

01:31:45.027 --> 01:31:47.018
And that's why I took the liberty

01:31:47.129 --> 01:31:50.724
of inviting some of
Deion's ex-wives down

01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:53.199
so maybe they could tell you
for themselves.

01:31:53.302 --> 01:31:54.929
Ladies!

01:31:55.037 --> 01:31:56.561
Hello, Antoine.

01:31:56.706 --> 01:31:59.641
-I've been looking for you.
-Daddy!

01:31:59.742 --> 01:32:02.233
Antoine? He told me
his name was Luther!

01:32:02.344 --> 01:32:03.311
Who is that ho?

01:32:03.412 --> 01:32:05.039
He told me he was gay.

01:32:05.147 --> 01:32:09.140
No, no, no. Y'all got me confused with
my gay twin brother, Antoine Luther.

01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:11.742
-You dead, gold digger!
-Get your butt back here!

01:32:11.854 --> 01:32:12.912
I'm out!

01:32:13.022 --> 01:32:15.081
Looks like the wedding's off, bro.

01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:16.556
Church!

01:32:18.227 --> 01:32:19.922
-God damn it, Norbit!
-Oh, snap!

01:32:20.029 --> 01:32:20.996
Get him!

01:32:21.097 --> 01:32:22.291
Norbit!

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:27.167
Mother Mary! Jesus! Noah! Christ!

01:32:28.304 --> 01:32:29.328
Good.

01:32:44.553 --> 01:32:46.350
You going somewhere, Norbit?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.093
-You messed up, boy.
-That's right.

01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:03.561
Now you gonna pay. Big time!

01:33:03.672 --> 01:33:07.039
Latimore! Keep your fakakta hands
off him!

01:33:07.143 --> 01:33:09.634
Go back to your shop, Abe,
before I kilI you, too!

01:33:09.745 --> 01:33:12.942
Hey! You gonna have to kilI me, as well!

01:33:13.048 --> 01:33:14.845

01:33:35.204 --> 01:33:36.330
Mind your goddamn business.

01:33:36.438 --> 01:33:38.929
Mind your business. Get out of here.
Move it.

01:33:39.942 --> 01:33:41.705
No, you didn't!

01:33:41.811 --> 01:33:43.779
Bye-bye.

01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:50.577
Bring it, bitches!

01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:55.589
Oh, hell to the no.

01:33:55.691 --> 01:33:58.182

01:34:20.282 --> 01:34:22.409

01:34:22.518 --> 01:34:23.644

01:34:25.354 --> 01:34:27.379
Whale, ho!

01:34:28.724 --> 01:34:30.589
Did somebody just call me a whale?

01:34:30.693 --> 01:34:32.820
Yeah, and a ho!

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.662
