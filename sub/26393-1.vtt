WEBVTT

00:03.307 --> 00:04.787
Hey, Grover,
we'’re almost there.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.484
Check out our
new neighborhood.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.312
I guess it looks cool.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.314
I'’ll tell Grammy how nice it is

00:10.358 --> 00:12.229
so she won'’t be worried
we moved.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.840
Aw, did Grammy tell you
she was worried?

00:14.884 --> 00:17.756
She said she wishes we didn'’t
have to live so far away.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.802
Aw.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.064
She also wishes
we weren'’t moving

00:21.108 --> 00:22.196
to a black neighborhood.

00:24.981 --> 00:28.202
I am really
gonna miss your mom.Okay.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.726
Buddy, I-I wouldn'’t call it
a black neighborhood.

00:30.769 --> 00:34.164
Really? He'’s black. He's black.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.905
She'’s black.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.994
Would you look at over there?
That'’s a palm tree.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.735
Oh, yeah, right next
to that black guy.

00:41.476 --> 00:42.999
All right, son.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.088
It'’s time to set up
for Yardecue Day.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.743
Got to get the tables, fire up
the smoker, and prep the meats.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.962
Yeah, that sounds
like a whole lot.

00:50.006 --> 00:50.963
You'’d better get busy.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.532
What is so important
on this phone?

00:54.576 --> 00:56.534
I know it'’s not looking
for a job.

00:56.578 --> 00:59.363
It'’s a video
talking about evolution.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.148
It says the number one key
to survival

01:01.191 --> 01:03.106
is being able
to adapt to change.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.543
Hmm. You know, the number
one key to yoursurvival

01:05.587 --> 01:07.980
is getting your butt up and
helping me stack some wood.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.505
Hey, hey, Pop, look.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.334
I hate stacking that wood, man.
There'’s always spiders.

01:13.377 --> 01:15.771
[laughs]: Exactly. That'’s
why you'’re stacking the wood.

01:16.989 --> 01:20.515
Six, seven, eight...

01:20.558 --> 01:22.604
Sweetie, please stop
counting black people.

01:24.649 --> 01:27.739
Okay, just because there'’s
more diversity here

01:27.783 --> 01:29.567
doesn'’t mean we won't get along
with everyone.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.308
Inside of all these homes

01:31.352 --> 01:33.354
are people and families
that are just like us.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.877
Plus, my new school
where you'’re gonna go

01:34.920 --> 01:36.618
is super close by.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.055
Yes, and that'’s another reason
why we chose this house.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.145
Mm-hmm.Grammy says that it was the only
house that we could afford.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.581
[sighs]
Wow, it'’s like she's still here.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.809
[screams] A spider is on me!

01:53.852 --> 01:55.332
It got me![laughs]

01:55.376 --> 01:57.552
It'’s not funny, man.

01:57.595 --> 02:00.294
You know, you are extra
annoying on Yardecue Day.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.123
Son, how can you have
such a bad attitude

02:03.166 --> 02:04.689
on a day like today?

02:04.733 --> 02:07.649
Yardecue Day is about bringing
our community together

02:07.692 --> 02:10.391
to celebrate what makes
this neighborhood special.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.393
Which is?Me.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.701
Seriously, son,

02:16.745 --> 02:18.616
our family'’s been in this
neighborhood for generations,

02:18.660 --> 02:20.401
and the culture
that we helped to create

02:20.444 --> 02:22.490
is worthy of respect.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.841
Now you watch the firebox while
I go in and season the meat.

02:25.884 --> 02:29.105
Oh, boy, you mean I actually
get to touch the smoker?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.802
No, you don'’t get
to touch the smoker.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.717
I said watch the smoker.
Don'’t touch the smoker.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.287
I'’m the only one
touches the smoker.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.811
Man, I hate Yardecue Day.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.335
[tires screech]

02:44.338 --> 02:46.209
Hey, we'’re your new neighbors,
the Johnsons.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.863
Dave, hurry. He needs to pee.

02:47.906 --> 02:51.083
I'’m sorry. Long
drive, big soda.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.259
I'’m coming, hold on.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.480
Hey, look,
our neighbor'’s diverse, too.

03:00.963 --> 03:05.141
Although maybe today'’s gonna be
more fun than I thought.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.056
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

03:07.099 --> 03:08.057
♪ Welcome to the hood.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.890
Hey, Ma.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.718
Hey. I heard tires screech.

03:16.761 --> 03:19.851
I hate it when those gangbangers
tear up the street.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.505
You know, I saw them.

03:21.549 --> 03:24.421
Uh, I'’m not too sure what gang
they would be a part of.

03:24.465 --> 03:25.901
Oh, really?
Well, who was it, then?

03:25.944 --> 03:27.250
Oh, it'’s the new neighbors.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.121
Says their names
are the Johnsons.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.122
Johnsons?Hmm.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.647
Well, all right.Yeah.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.997
It is good to hear another
successful black family

03:35.040 --> 03:36.738
moving into that nice house.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.000
You know,
keeping the neighborhood

03:38.043 --> 03:39.697
headed in a positive direction.

03:39.741 --> 03:42.700
[laughs]: I'’m so glad
to hear you say that.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.180
Calvin,
how about we go over there

03:44.224 --> 03:46.313
and invite them
to Yardecue Day.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.053
You know what,
that'’s a good idea.Mm-hmm.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.186
I think that is a great idea.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.625
How I look, baby?

03:54.669 --> 03:56.627
Mmm, as handsome as ever, baby.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.150
[both chuckle]Hey there.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.065
[chuckles]Hello.

04:02.677 --> 04:05.332
Uh, we'’re-we're looking
for the Johnsons.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.160
Well, you found '’em.
Dave Johnson. Nice to meet you.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.293
Take a step back

04:10.337 --> 04:12.208
so I can see the handshake.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.949
Uh, nice to meet you, too.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.778
I'’m Tina. This is my husband
Calvin. We'’re the Butlers.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.388
Oh, great,
'’cause I rang for some tea

04:18.432 --> 04:19.520
about a half hour ago.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.696
[laughs]

04:21.739 --> 04:23.306
What the...?Actually, we'’re
your new neighbors.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.483
And we live right next door.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.180
Oh, no way.
This is you guys right here?Uh-huh.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.052
It'’s so nice to meet you.[stammers]

04:30.095 --> 04:31.183
So, your name is Johnson?

04:32.184 --> 04:34.535
Like-like Magic Johnson,
Dwayne Johnson?

04:34.578 --> 04:36.493
All the other black Johnsons?

04:36.537 --> 04:38.278
Oh, yeah.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.801
And like Magic Johnson,
I'’m from Michigan,

04:39.844 --> 04:42.586
and like Dwayne Johnson,
I rock. [laughs]

04:42.630 --> 04:45.110
[laughing]:
That'’s pretty f...

04:47.112 --> 04:49.898
That'’s a pretty serious smoker
you got there.Oh, yeah.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.291
Calvin built it himself.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.075
We own an auto repair shop.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.598
Calvin'’s really
good with tools.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.208
Oh, that'’s so cool.
I love to barbecue.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.645
What kind of wood do you use?

04:57.688 --> 05:00.604
Hickory. Little mixture
of oak and pecan.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.780
Wow. I'’d love
to try that someday.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.695
I bet you would.Why don'’t you, uh...

05:04.739 --> 05:06.567
come by later.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.743
A bunch of people from the
neighborhood are gonna stop by.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.484
Ooh. You know,
I don'’t know that we can.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.137
The movers should
be here any minute.

05:12.181 --> 05:14.096
Aw, just come by for a bit.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.359
In this neighborhood,
we believe in hospitality.

05:16.403 --> 05:19.188
Right?But we also believe
in privacy,

05:19.231 --> 05:22.147
so, you know, do what you
got to do. You know. Hey.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.019
Okay, well, we'’ll try
to make it over for a plate.Well, all right.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.325
Okay.It was so nice
to meet you guys.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.630
Yeah, okay.Nice to meet you.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.719
We'’ll see you later.
All right.
All right.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.286
All right, okay--
I'’m gonna kill you.Yeah.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.247
I just got off the phone
with the movers.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.597
They won'’t be here
until tomorrow.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.034
There was a huge accident
on the highway.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.296
Oh, that'’s great!

05:41.645 --> 05:43.430
I mean,
I-I hope no one was hurt.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.520
But now we can go
to the barbecue.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.783
What barbecue?Next door. Our neighbors
just invited us.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.524
Oh, that'’s nice.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.526
But where are we supposed
to sleep tonight?

05:52.569 --> 05:54.919
Ooh, the camping
gear'’s in the car.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.399
I could set it up in here.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.793
Okay. But I guess that means

05:58.836 --> 06:02.057
you'’re gonna have
to pitch a tent for me.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.495
I can pitch a tent
if you chop my wood.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.065
Sweetie, we really need
to work on our sexy talk.Yeah, that was...

06:10.108 --> 06:12.023
That was bad. That was bad.[knock at door]

06:12.067 --> 06:13.721
MARTY:
Hello! Uh, hi.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.897
I'’m Marty Butler. My parents
told me you just moved in and...

06:15.940 --> 06:18.421
[laughs]

06:18.465 --> 06:20.423
Ah.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.555
I had to come
and see for myself.

06:23.644 --> 06:24.906
Well, hi. I'’m Dave Johnson.
Come on in.

06:24.949 --> 06:25.863
Hi.This is my wife Gemma.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.430
Hi, Gemma.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.737
Hi.[laughs]

06:29.780 --> 06:31.347
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
they weren'’t kidding

06:31.391 --> 06:32.609
when they said
you guys were-were...

06:32.653 --> 06:34.872
were not from around here.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.439
Oh, no.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.310
We just moved here
from a small town in Michigan.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.704
Right into this neighborhood.
I love it.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.097
And why wouldn'’t you?

06:42.140 --> 06:43.446
Look at these built-ins.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.708
Oh, I know.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.101
Aren'’t they to die for?

06:46.144 --> 06:47.885
They might just be.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.887
I'’m sorry, what?

06:49.931 --> 06:52.455
No, it'’s just that there aren't
a lot of other people

06:52.499 --> 06:53.978
like you around here.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.589
I'’m sorry,
are-are you saying

06:55.632 --> 06:57.373
it'’s gonna be a problem
that we live here?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.767
No, not at all. No, not for me.
You know, I'’m an engineer,

06:59.810 --> 07:01.421
so all the science
says it'’s good

07:01.464 --> 07:02.770
for people to live
in diverse communities.

07:02.813 --> 07:05.555
Oh. Well, good. We
couldn'’t agree more.

07:05.599 --> 07:08.602
Yeah, it'’s too bad
my dad hates science.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.605
Calvin? But he just
invited us to a barbecue.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.042
Oh, no.
No, actually, my mom did.

07:14.085 --> 07:16.174
At least, that'’s how
it'’s being discussed very loudly

07:16.218 --> 07:17.437
at my house right now.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.090
Oh. Well, Gem,

07:19.134 --> 07:21.310
if that'’s how he feels,
we shouldn'’t go.Ooh.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.616
Uh, I'’m afraid
it'’s not that easy.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.227
You see, my mom invited you
into her home.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.185
If you don'’t come,
she will be offended.

07:27.229 --> 07:28.404
Won'’t she understand?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.449
Seriously?

07:31.059 --> 07:32.974
What is it like
where you come from?

07:34.845 --> 07:37.282
Besides, you got to come
or you'’ll seem racist.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.501
Is that the original hardware

07:38.545 --> 07:40.460
on this door?

07:40.503 --> 07:42.897
What? We are not racist.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.856
If-if anyone'’s being racist,
it sounds like it'’s your dad.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.076
Ooh, no, no, no,
no, no. See, uh,

07:48.119 --> 07:50.034
black people can'’t be racist.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.210
We can be racial.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.908
Not "cist."

07:55.083 --> 07:57.781
"Cial." "Cist."

07:57.825 --> 08:00.218
Well, we'’re not "cist"
or "cial" or...

08:00.262 --> 08:01.785
Whatever we are, we'’re not.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.136
Your mom was nice
enough to invite us,

08:05.180 --> 08:08.531
and where we come from, that
means something. We'’re going.

08:08.575 --> 08:09.880
Okay, but, Gem, we'’re...I said we'’re going.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.841
And we are gonna have fun!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.453
Oh, I know
I'’m gonna have some fun.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.768
Hey, Pop,
Mom wants to know how...

08:27.811 --> 08:30.510
[coughing]

08:30.553 --> 08:32.860
Mm-hmm.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.340
That'’s what you get for
pulling that little stunt

08:35.384 --> 08:37.255
you did with the
neighbors earlier.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.475
You lucky it'’s the smoke the
only thing that'’s choking you.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.305
Okay, man.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.829
Look, why are you so mad that
that guy'’s coming over here?

08:45.873 --> 08:49.050
Because it'’s Yardecue Day,
and this is my house,

08:49.093 --> 08:51.618
and I don'’t like that guy.Oh, yeah? Why?

08:51.661 --> 08:53.141
Because he'’s too familiar.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.143
He acts like he knows
you when he doesn'’t,

08:55.186 --> 08:56.927
and I can'’t stand that.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.277
It sounds like he'’s
just being friendly, Pop.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.671
Exactly. It'’s weird, man.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.152
A-And I'’m pretty sure

09:04.195 --> 09:05.588
it'’s racist, too.[scoffs]

09:05.632 --> 09:08.069
Oh, man, he'’s cool.

09:08.112 --> 09:10.811
The first thing he did when
he got here was shake my hand.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.813
Son, look,
you'’re only saying that

09:12.856 --> 09:15.598
because you don'’t know
there are two types of racists:

09:15.642 --> 09:17.339
there'’s ones
who hate black people

09:17.382 --> 09:18.862
and ones who love black people.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.344
A white guy trying
to shake your hand?

09:22.387 --> 09:25.173
[chuckles] Stay woke, son.

09:25.216 --> 09:29.786
Is this meat the only thing
you been smoking all day?

09:29.830 --> 09:33.268
Son, look,
there are some white people

09:33.311 --> 09:36.140
that love black people
just because they'’re black.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.229
Makes them feel all good
on the inside.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.754
You know,
like they'’re doing us a favor.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.538
"Hey, I have lots
of black friends.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.149
"I'’m a good person.

09:45.193 --> 09:48.109
I find Rihanna
very attractive."

09:48.152 --> 09:50.851
So, basically, you think
this guy is racist

09:50.894 --> 09:53.114
because he'’s too nice to you?

09:53.157 --> 09:55.725
Think about it. Would you
be nice to me if we just met?

09:58.075 --> 10:00.600
Well, damn, that'’s
a good point.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.211
Besides, man,
this is a black neighborhood,

10:03.254 --> 10:05.866
something built
for us by us.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.650
You let one family
like that move in,

10:07.694 --> 10:10.218
and next thing you know,
it'’s gonna be a bunch of dudes

10:10.261 --> 10:12.655
jogging around
in their little short shorts,

10:12.699 --> 10:14.570
walking their
vegan labradoodles.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.530
Dad, do we have to go
to the barbecue?

10:18.574 --> 10:20.532
Why? Did Mommy say
we didn'’t have to go?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.014
No.

10:24.058 --> 10:26.495
Oh. Well, why don'’t
you want to go, buddy?

10:26.538 --> 10:28.845
I think there'’s gonna be a
bunch of kids over there.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.413
I know, but what if no one
wants to play with me?

10:31.456 --> 10:33.241
Oh, come here.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.852
Look... [sighs]

10:35.896 --> 10:38.942
I know you'’re scared,
and that'’s okay.

10:38.986 --> 10:43.164
I-I'’m surprisingly
worried, too.

10:43.207 --> 10:46.036
But trust me, we'’re both
gonna go over there.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.864
We'’re gonna make
some friends today.

10:47.908 --> 10:50.693
All right, Johnsons, let'’s go
make that jerk love us.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.392
Is Mommy why
you'’re worried?

10:54.436 --> 10:56.307
She is now.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.353
Hey, baby.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.224
Any sign of
the new neighbors yet?

11:00.268 --> 11:01.704
Nope.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.227
Well, ain'’t that something?Hmm.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.881
I invite them
into my home,

11:04.925 --> 11:06.796
laugh at his
corny jokes.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.625
You know, he has the
audacity not to show up.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.932
Tina!Hi, Dave.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.717
So glad you could make it.

11:14.761 --> 11:15.936
Calvin.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.025
Hey, Dave.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.462
Hi, I'’m Tina.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.899
I'’m Gemma.
This is our son, Grover.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.118
Grover?

11:26.207 --> 11:28.644
Grover Johnson?

11:28.688 --> 11:31.821
We brought this. We got it to
celebrate our first night

11:31.865 --> 11:33.562
in the house, but we thought
it'’d be fun to share it

11:33.605 --> 11:34.519
with our new neighbors.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.391
Oh, how thoughtful.

11:36.434 --> 11:37.784
Isn'’t that thoughtful, baby?

11:37.827 --> 11:40.177
I'’m more of a beer man, myself.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.353
I'’m more of a
beer man, too.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.442
I just love a good IPA.
How about you?

11:44.486 --> 11:47.271
Dude, I just like beer.

11:47.315 --> 11:50.274
Well, how about we go inside
and pop this baby open?

11:50.318 --> 11:53.756
And show all these freeloaders
how to bring a gift!

11:56.324 --> 11:58.805
So aren'’t you gonna go in
and have some champagne?

11:58.848 --> 12:01.938
No, like I said,
I'’m-I'm a beer man, too.

12:05.507 --> 12:06.813
So, let'’s take a
look at your meat.

12:09.598 --> 12:10.512
I'’m gonna go inside.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.786
You guys playing chess?

12:25.614 --> 12:26.789
Who'’s winning?

12:26.833 --> 12:29.096
Malcolm always beats me,

12:29.139 --> 12:31.098
but today I got him...Checkmate. [laughs]

12:31.141 --> 12:33.317
Oh, you-- I'’m-I'm-I'’m sorry.

12:33.361 --> 12:34.971
That'’s-that's my fault,
I distracted you.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.495
Yeah. You heard him,
he distracted me.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.106
He owes you five dollars,
not me.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.978
[laughs]

12:42.022 --> 12:43.893
We started to meet earlier;
I'’m Dave.

12:43.937 --> 12:44.764
Hey, Dave. I'’m Malcolm.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.678
May I?Yeah, go ahead, man.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.812
I'’m white.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.947
Yes, you are.

12:53.990 --> 12:57.385
[laughs]

12:57.428 --> 12:59.779
So, you and Marty
both live here?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.998
Oh, no, I do.
When Marty got a job,

13:02.042 --> 13:03.957
he moved to a
different neighborhood.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.349
Oh, how come?

13:05.393 --> 13:06.829
Because my dad said,

13:06.873 --> 13:08.396
"You got a job,
now get out."

13:08.439 --> 13:10.311
[laughs]

13:10.354 --> 13:12.182
So tell me about
the other neighbors.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.836
Okay. Well, um,

13:13.880 --> 13:15.620
that'’s Rudy and Teresa's
place over there.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.013
They'’re really nice.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.928
Miss Kim, she'’s
an elderly lady,

13:18.972 --> 13:22.062
she lives over there, and
that is where Victor lives.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.106
Oh, what'’s Victor like?

13:23.150 --> 13:24.716
Oh, he'’s cool, man.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.675
You know, for a crackhead.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.505
Wow. I mean,
that'’s-that's crazy...

13:30.548 --> 13:32.681
that we live across the street
from a-a crackhead.

13:32.724 --> 13:35.466
Hey, man.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.904
You can'’t be calling
Crackhead Victor a crackhead.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.863
I'’m-I'm sorry,
but you just did.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.865
I know I did, because
I know him like that.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.867
You don'’t, all right?

13:44.911 --> 13:47.565
That dude used to be the
coolest guy on this block.

13:47.609 --> 13:50.090
We used to ride our bikes up
and down the street together.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.093
Wow, so you guys were friends?
What happened?

13:53.136 --> 13:54.268
The dude started
smoking crack.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.228
Man, you know, I used to think
that guys like him

13:58.272 --> 14:00.535
were the problem, but now,
seeing everything

14:00.578 --> 14:03.755
that'’s going on with the opioid
epidemic, starting to think

14:03.799 --> 14:06.367
that it'’s the addicts who are
the real victims.
Absolutely.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.151
Who'’re the real victims?The addicts.

14:08.195 --> 14:11.546
Like our neighbor, Crack...
[clears throat]

14:11.589 --> 14:13.461
Like Victor.

14:13.504 --> 14:16.377
[chuckles]
You see, son?

14:16.420 --> 14:17.900
See? This is what
I'’m talking about.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.771
This guy likes
black people so much,

14:19.815 --> 14:21.382
he thinks he likes Victor.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.688
Okay.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.212
We'’ll see how much you
like him once he steals

14:25.255 --> 14:27.083
all the airbags
out your car.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.569
Hi.

14:34.612 --> 14:37.006
Hey, everybody'’s almost gone;
maybe we should go, too.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.269
No way. Tina and I
are having fun.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.532
Did you know she was
a Laker girl for one game?

14:43.534 --> 14:45.058
But, you know, I don'’t think
Calvin wants us here.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.189
I keep trying to
connect with him

14:46.233 --> 14:48.191
and nothing seems
to be working.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.454
Oh, sweetie, relax.
You'’re trying too hard.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.542
You'’re coming off thirsty.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.371
Tina just taught me that.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.025
Oh.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.984
Girl, I realized we have been
talking all day,

14:58.027 --> 15:00.029
and I still haven'’t asked you
why you moved here.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.857
Oh, I got a job as a principal

15:01.901 --> 15:04.468
at a little progressive school
nearby.
Oh, wow.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.470
Wait a minute now.
What'’s a "progressive school"?

15:06.514 --> 15:09.604
Oh, it means they don'’t
teach the kids anything.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.954
That'’s not true.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.913
We just believe children learn
better when they'’re motivated

15:13.956 --> 15:16.698
by a feeling of personal
satisfaction instead of grades.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.788
Okay. Yeah. Th-That'’s the
progressive way of saying

15:19.831 --> 15:21.921
what I just said.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.835
Don'’t talk to my
new friend like that.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.012
It'’s not her fault that her
school sounds stupid.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.972
I'’m sorry. I didn't
mean it that way.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.279
It'’s cool. I know you
weren'’t throwing shade.Ah.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.976
I learned that, too.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.198
Oh, baby, there you are.
Come on in, join us.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.156
Oh, actually,
I was gonna eat outside.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.723
But there'’s nobody out there.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.551
Exactly.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.118
Please.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.294
[sighs]

15:47.337 --> 15:49.644
Oh. Oh.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.649
Th-There'’s a button
right next to you, on the side.

15:54.692 --> 15:57.957
It'’s all you.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.221
So, Dave, what do you do?

16:01.264 --> 16:03.614
I'’m a professional
conflict mediator.

16:03.658 --> 16:04.746
What'’s that?

16:04.789 --> 16:06.139
Well, you know,
when two people

16:06.182 --> 16:07.662
have a problem
they can'’t solve,

16:07.705 --> 16:10.926
they hire me to come in
and help them fix it.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.189
So it'’s like when I fix a car,
but what I do is real,

16:13.233 --> 16:16.149
and... what you do

16:16.192 --> 16:18.455
is some touchy-feely
fairy-tale-type crap.

16:18.499 --> 16:21.067
Well, I wouldn'’t call it
a fairy tale.

16:21.110 --> 16:24.026
Yeah, it'’s a real job,
and he'’s good at it.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.680
It sounds like to me, you think

16:25.723 --> 16:27.943
you just know better
than everybody else.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.379
MALCOLM: Oh, please.
You are the only one here

16:29.423 --> 16:31.991
who thinks he knows better
than everybody else.

16:32.034 --> 16:35.124
Okay, you know, I'’ve had about
enough of your disrespect today.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.039
Pop, you'’re always talking to me
about respect,

16:37.083 --> 16:39.346
and you never show me any.Well, that'’s because

16:39.389 --> 16:43.176
when I get up, I go to work;
when you get up, you go pee.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.529
You know what, man?
I don'’t need this.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.313
You don'’t need what?I don'’t need you telling me

16:50.357 --> 16:52.794
to get a job all the time like
I don'’t have plans of my own.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.883
Plans of your own? [laughs]
Boy, you can'’t even afford

16:54.926 --> 16:57.712
your own data plan.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.409
Well, that'’s funny, right?
Embarrassing me in front

16:59.453 --> 17:00.802
of these people I don'’t know?You-you started it.

17:00.845 --> 17:05.285
[overlapping arguing]

17:05.328 --> 17:06.721
Hey, uh, guys.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.766
Guys.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.986
Maybe I can help.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.207
Oh, God, Dave, please don'’t.No, no, no, it'’s okay.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.731
Look, this-this is what I do.

17:16.774 --> 17:21.475
Now, it seems to me like neither
one of you is feeling respected.

17:21.518 --> 17:22.824
Wow.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.395
Dave, you are really good
at your job.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.571
Thanks.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.616
Malcolm, tell your dad

17:32.660 --> 17:34.488
why you feel like
he doesn'’t respect you.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.577
Come on, come on.
I'’m not doing this.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.231
See, no.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.406
This is just another white guy

17:39.449 --> 17:41.103
trying to fix
a black man'’s problem

17:41.147 --> 17:42.974
so he can feel good
about himself.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.715
Calvin, that'’s not fair.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.587
Really? Okay.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.111
Tell me how you feel
about Rihanna.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.112
I find her very attractive.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.722
Oh, God.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.463
You see? This is what
I'’m talking about.

17:53.507 --> 17:55.813
I'’ve been giving this guy
a hard time all day,

17:55.857 --> 17:57.424
yet he'’s still being nice to me.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.687
Why? Because I'’m a black man.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.385
It'’s like affirmative action
for friends.

18:02.429 --> 18:05.693
Okay, look. Uh, Calvin,
that'’s not true.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.912
Look, I-I just want to be
friends with my neighbors.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.958
And yeah, maybe I'’m trying
a little extra hard

18:10.001 --> 18:11.394
because I'’m the only
white guy around.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.266
If that makes me seem racist,

18:13.309 --> 18:16.704
then... [sighs] I'’m-I'm sorry.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.360
In fact... Hey, look, I'’m...

18:21.796 --> 18:22.840
I'’m sorry...

18:22.884 --> 18:25.974
if-if I seem racist.

18:29.586 --> 18:30.805
[stammers]
I'’m-- Hey, hey, man,

18:30.848 --> 18:32.111
I'’m-I'm sorry if I seem racist.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.333
All right.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.207
Thank you.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.301
Look, if I give you a hug,
would you leave my house?

18:51.782 --> 18:55.308
All right. Okay.
All right.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.356
Cool, Dad, you made
the jerk like you.

19:02.053 --> 19:05.056
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.711
Thank you, thank you, thank you
so much for having us.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.104
Yeah, uh, you'’ll have to come
over to our house next.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.497
Okay.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.238
And it'’s because
we want you there,

19:12.281 --> 19:13.326
not just because you'’re black.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.893
Dave!
Okay.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.982
[door closes]

19:18.026 --> 19:19.462
Can you believe it?

19:19.506 --> 19:21.682
I mean,
can you believe it?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.988
That little boy'’s name
is Grover Johnson.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.346
♪

19:36.827 --> 19:37.698
Hey, what'’s up, man?

19:37.741 --> 19:40.222
Oh, hey.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.963
Wait.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.182
You'’re not gonna jump over here

19:43.225 --> 19:44.226
and try to hug me again,
are you?

19:44.270 --> 19:47.795
[laughs] No, no.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.450
Hey, thanks for having my back
in there with your dad.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.103
Oh, that'’s cool.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.670
But, you know,
if he kicks me out,

19:53.714 --> 19:55.194
I'’m coming to move in
with y'’all.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.504
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

20:01.548 --> 20:03.767
Do you think it was a mistake
to move here?

20:03.811 --> 20:05.552
Why would that be a mistake?

20:05.595 --> 20:07.206
Well, I-I don'’t know.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.164
You know,
maybe you'’re dad's right;

20:09.208 --> 20:10.905
I don'’t fit in here.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.776
I kept trying to be
a good guy today,

20:12.820 --> 20:15.823
but no one seemed
to see me that way.

20:15.866 --> 20:19.261
Yeah, well, you know, it'’s hard
when you see yourself one way,

20:19.305 --> 20:22.830
and the rest of the world,
they... see you another.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.704
Doesn'’t feel very good, does it?

20:27.748 --> 20:30.229
Nope. Not at all.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.494
Look, you know... [sighs]

20:34.537 --> 20:37.192
this is gonna sound corny,

20:37.236 --> 20:39.063
but I-I really believe

20:39.107 --> 20:41.283
that if people would just focus
on what we have in common

20:41.327 --> 20:43.503
instead of how we'’re different,

20:43.546 --> 20:46.593
w-we could solve
so many of our problems.

20:46.636 --> 20:49.987
You know what?
That may be true.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.642
But I also think it'’s a lot
easier for someone like you

20:52.686 --> 20:54.992
to believe that, than it is
for someone like me.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.040
Okay.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.130
I better get to bed.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.045
Uh, good night.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.917
Good night, man.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.136
Hey, Dave.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.920
Yeah?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.922
Welcome to the neighborhood.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.017
"I have lots
of black friends."
