cups, but I think she's right.

22:48.323 --> 22:51.195
- Chief Boden was telling me
about a meeting he had today,

22:51.239 --> 22:53.894
one of those CFD gatherings
for the brass that goes

22:53.937 --> 22:57.027
on all day, you know, where
the HR pencil pushers lecture

22:57.071 --> 23:00.335
about how you can't make jokes
anymore about women or race

23:00.379 --> 23:01.641
or old people like me?

23:01.684 --> 23:03.382
- Uh, old people
are still funny.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.687
- Agreed.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.341
Anyway, my point
is, Hawkins probably

23:06.385 --> 23:07.908
had to be at the same meeting.

23:07.951 --> 23:11.302
Maybe that's why you
haven't heard from him.

23:11.346 --> 23:14.871
- Mouch, I love you.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.656
- I like the vibe
of this place.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.440
Thanks for the invite.

23:18.484 --> 23:23.053
- I just wanted to clear the
air before you started at 51.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.272
- How do you mean?

23:24.315 --> 23:25.708
- Let's be honest, Carver.

23:25.752 --> 23:28.885
We were not exactly best
friends at the Academy.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.192
- We're two competitive,
driven people.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.585
That's all.

23:32.628 --> 23:33.716
Probably more what
we had in common that

23:33.760 --> 23:36.415
kept us battling back then.

23:36.458 --> 23:40.462
- That and your cocky attitude.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.117
- [chuckles] I hear that.

23:43.160 --> 23:47.034
But I was a newbie.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.689
It's one of the reasons
I'm so stoked to be at 51,

23:49.732 --> 23:54.345
is to show you the kind
of firefighter I am now.

23:54.389 --> 23:58.698
Well, tell me about you and
this fast track to lieutenant.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.700
How'd it all come about?

24:00.743 --> 24:03.877
- A hell of a lot
of work, studying,

24:03.920 --> 24:06.706
training sessions,
leadership seminars.

24:06.749 --> 24:09.448
- I'm sure Chief Boden
was a big supporter.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.536
- He was.

24:10.579 --> 24:13.974
And DC Hill gave me a boost.

24:14.017 --> 24:21.024
- Ah, DC Hill, [chuckles]
that makes sense.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.897
- What do you mean?

24:23.940 --> 24:27.727
- Just that I can
see her being a fan.

24:27.770 --> 24:34.951
Let me get the next round.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.958
- Good chat with Carver?

24:42.002 --> 24:43.351
- Ha.

24:43.394 --> 24:46.572
I mention getting a little
support from DC Hill,

24:46.615 --> 24:48.965
and he says that makes sense.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.967
What the hell do you
think he meant by that?

24:51.011 --> 24:52.752
- You're asking me?
Or you already have--

24:52.795 --> 24:54.405
- He thinks that only
reason I got promoted is

24:54.449 --> 24:59.062
because I'm a woman of color.

24:59.106 --> 25:04.633
- [sighs] Or he's
trying to get to you,

25:04.677 --> 25:07.506
but either way, not cool.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.683
What are you going to do?

25:10.726 --> 25:15.992
- For some reason, Boden
loves this guy, so I--

25:16.036 --> 25:20.954
I just--I--I got to do
my best to make it work.

25:20.997 --> 25:25.785
Mm.

25:25.828 --> 25:29.615
You connect with Upton?

25:29.658 --> 25:31.530
Can she help?

25:31.573 --> 25:33.140
- Some things cops
and firefighters

25:33.183 --> 25:36.273
don't see eye to eye on.

25:36.317 --> 25:39.668
I mean, just--inside
man needs to be outed.

25:39.712 --> 25:43.150
I just don't know how
to force the issue.

25:43.193 --> 25:47.981
- You could go a little
further up the chain.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.417
Listen, maybe it's
time you checked

25:49.460 --> 25:51.593
in with Commander Pearce.

25:51.637 --> 25:52.899
- You kidding?

25:52.942 --> 25:53.900
Forget it.

25:53.943 --> 26:00.950
No.

26:08.871 --> 26:15.748
- Uh, I--I left
you a voicemail.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.099
- In the meeting, I
had a million messages.

26:19.142 --> 26:21.884
I--

26:21.928 --> 26:23.190
[scoffs]

26:23.233 --> 26:26.846
--never thought one
would be from you.

26:26.889 --> 26:29.892
- [exhales heavily]

26:29.936 --> 26:37.117
- I thought you
were done with me.

26:41.425 --> 26:44.298
- [sighing]

26:44.341 --> 26:48.607
- Are you really here?

26:48.650 --> 26:50.652
- I am here.

26:50.696 --> 26:57.920
Yes, completely and totally.

27:14.937 --> 27:18.637
- Knock, knock.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.639
- Kelly.

27:20.682 --> 27:24.947
I don't think I've seen you
since your father's funeral.

27:24.991 --> 27:25.948
How are you?

27:25.992 --> 27:27.689
- Eh, pretty good.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.952
Yeah, just got married.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.737
- Congratulations.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.738
- Yeah.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.174
It's a good thing.

27:34.217 --> 27:35.958
Hey, uh, do you have
a minute, Commander?

27:36.002 --> 27:38.787
I need some help with,
uh, a little situation

27:38.831 --> 27:41.790
I got roped into.

27:41.834 --> 27:44.488
- You did him wrong.

27:44.532 --> 27:47.100
Your father loved
you above all else.

27:47.143 --> 27:50.320
He'd've done anything for you.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.495
- I know that.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.062
- Then why toward
the end of his life

27:53.106 --> 27:54.150
did he have to lean
on friends like me

27:54.194 --> 27:55.717
instead of his only son?

27:55.761 --> 27:58.981
- I think you know that
Benny was a complicated man.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.331
- He was your father,
and he deserved

28:01.375 --> 28:04.683
better than what you gave him.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.510
So what makes you think
I'm inclined to do

28:06.554 --> 28:13.517
any favors for you?

28:21.656 --> 28:25.181
- When I was 16, uh, I
came home late one night,

28:25.225 --> 28:30.143
and I saw Benny
sitting in the dark,

28:30.186 --> 28:34.495
halfway through a bottle
of rye, tears on his face.

28:34.538 --> 28:37.324
I asked him what was
wrong, and he just

28:37.367 --> 28:40.370
kept muttering on and on
about some big mistake

28:40.414 --> 28:45.724
he almost made, the kind
of thing you can't undo,

28:45.767 --> 28:50.729
that he'd be rotting in jail
right now if Marty Pearce

28:50.772 --> 28:54.384
hadn't set him straight.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.735
Yeah, the next day
when he sobered up,

28:56.778 --> 28:58.432
I asked him about it.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.216
He just acted like he didn't
know what I was talking about.

29:00.260 --> 29:07.267
But from then on, one
thing I knew for sure,

29:08.094 --> 29:10.313
you are a man of honor.

29:10.357 --> 29:14.317
Benny was not an easy man to
steer in the right direction.

29:14.361 --> 29:18.408
I'm not here because I think
you'll do me any favors.

29:18.452 --> 29:25.589
I'm here because I know
you'll do what's right.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.331
[sighs]

29:28.375 --> 29:31.421
- OK, I'd like you all
to meet Sam Carver.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.206
Carver was assigned
to rig rescue

29:33.249 --> 29:35.730
when Ray Salazar
took a ride down

29:35.774 --> 29:38.080
that collapsing stairway
a few months back, in

29:38.124 --> 29:40.256
that two-flat fire in Austin.

29:40.300 --> 29:43.259
Carver was the first
to locate Salazar,

29:43.303 --> 29:47.350
and he managed to reach
through the wreckage,

29:47.394 --> 29:49.918
get a grip on him before he
slid into the basement, which

29:49.962 --> 29:51.485
was fully aflame.

29:51.528 --> 29:55.532
And he held onto him and
worked to dig Salazar out,

29:55.576 --> 29:58.797
even when the building
started shifting.

29:58.840 --> 30:05.629
35 minutes to extricate,
Carver never wavered.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.285
And it's because of him
that Salazar got to go home

30:09.329 --> 30:12.419
to his four-year-old
twins, and that's when

30:12.462 --> 30:19.513
I knew he was 51 material.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.777
- I just did what I had
to do to make the save.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.648
It helps when you're born
without the fear gene.

30:24.692 --> 30:30.829
[chuckling]

30:30.872 --> 30:32.047
- Welcome to 51, Carver.

30:32.091 --> 30:33.744
- Thank you.

30:33.788 --> 30:37.400
- OK, get to work.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.359
- New guy's bringing
that attitude.

30:39.402 --> 30:41.840
- Yeah, well, you came in with
plenty of swagger yourself.

30:41.883 --> 30:42.884
- Well, yeah.

30:42.928 --> 30:43.885
That's because I'm awesome.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.060
- Good to see s Carver.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.193
Hope you can live
up to the hype.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.325
- Just the kind of
challenge I like.

30:49.369 --> 30:56.550
Heard a lot about you,
Lieutenant Severide.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.036
- Violet, you are
literally glowing.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.124
[laughter]

31:05.167 --> 31:06.952
What happened with Hawkins?

31:06.995 --> 31:10.303
- Well, we worked it all out.

31:10.346 --> 31:11.913
- Well, is there any way
to stop the transfer?

31:11.957 --> 31:13.306
- He doesn't want to.

31:13.349 --> 31:14.960
He is actually happy
about it since it

31:15.003 --> 31:17.571
means we don't have to hide
our relationship anymore.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.965
We can be like a real
couple out in the world.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.009
Can you believe it?

31:21.053 --> 31:22.489
- That's amazing, Vi.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.707
- I know.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.013
And so was the night
we spent together.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.406
- Mm.

31:26.449 --> 31:27.407
Spill.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.321
- OK--

31:28.364 --> 31:31.715
[indistinct pa announcement]

31:31.759 --> 31:32.716
I will tell you later.

31:32.760 --> 31:39.680
[sirens]

31:48.254 --> 31:51.561
[coughing]

31:51.605 --> 31:52.823
- You have to
help them, please!

31:52.867 --> 31:54.303
- What happened?

31:54.347 --> 31:56.218
- The idiot DJ set off
pyros inside the tent,

31:56.262 --> 32:02.137
and half the wedding
party's still in there.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.489
Squad, search and
rescue under the canopy.

32:06.533 --> 32:07.490
Truck, search the other half.

32:07.534 --> 32:08.491
- Got it.

32:08.535 --> 32:09.840
- Medics, set up triage!

32:09.884 --> 32:11.320
- Hey, squad, let's go!
Let's move!

32:11.364 --> 32:12.843
Watch your step!

32:12.887 --> 32:15.846
- Gallo, Mouch, you're
coming inside with me!

32:15.890 --> 32:16.847
- I'm good to go, Lieutenant.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.066
- Negative, Carver!

32:18.110 --> 32:19.285
You stay here.

32:19.328 --> 32:22.636
Figure out a way to
kill that PA system.

32:22.679 --> 32:25.508
- Copy that.

32:25.552 --> 32:26.509
- Right here, buddy.

32:26.553 --> 32:27.423
I got you.

32:27.467 --> 32:30.165
- Let's go!

32:30.209 --> 32:31.340
- Come on.
Come on.

32:31.384 --> 32:32.733
Come on.
- Fire department!

32:32.776 --> 32:33.995
Call out if you can hear me!
- Careful.

32:34.039 --> 32:34.996
Watch your feet.

32:35.040 --> 32:35.997
- Over here!

32:36.041 --> 32:37.259
- You hear that, Lieutenant?

32:37.303 --> 32:38.260
- Where are they?

32:38.304 --> 32:45.267
[indistinct shouting]

32:46.268 --> 32:47.356
- Help us!

32:47.400 --> 32:48.357
- Lieutenant!

32:48.401 --> 32:49.532
That way, I think!

32:49.576 --> 32:52.709
Ah!

32:52.753 --> 32:53.754
- Over here!

32:53.797 --> 32:55.147
Got a victim!

32:55.190 --> 32:57.540
- Gallo, keep looking
for those kids!

32:57.584 --> 33:00.543
- I'm on it.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.937
[grunting]

33:02.981 --> 33:04.939
- It's melted to his skin!

33:04.983 --> 33:06.593
- Ah!

33:06.636 --> 33:08.290
- Cut him free!
Get him out of here.

33:08.334 --> 33:09.248
- Where are you?

33:09.291 --> 33:10.292
Call out!

33:10.336 --> 33:13.252
- We're under here!

33:13.295 --> 33:14.644
[sobbing, gasping]

33:14.688 --> 33:15.732
[coughing]

33:15.776 --> 33:17.604
- All right, come on, guys.

33:17.647 --> 33:18.648
I got you.

33:18.692 --> 33:23.175
I got you.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.524
All right, come on.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.961
- Garrett, my husband,
he was right next to me

33:27.005 --> 33:28.571
when the tent came down.
- All right.

33:28.615 --> 33:29.790
We'll get him out.
We'll get him out.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.052
Cruz.
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.227
- Watch out.
- I got you.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.228
I got you.

33:33.272 --> 33:34.229
- Ready?

33:34.273 --> 33:35.230
- Uh-huh.

33:35.274 --> 33:40.105
- And they're going.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.976
- Gary!

33:42.020 --> 33:43.673
Gary, can you hear me?

33:43.717 --> 33:45.414
Hey, Cap!

33:45.458 --> 33:48.504
Cap, give me a hand!

33:48.548 --> 33:50.724
All right.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.421
OK, 1, 2, 3.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.294
[grunting]

33:55.337 --> 33:58.514
- Garrett, oh god.

33:58.558 --> 33:59.646
Garrett.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.909
- All right, just stay back.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.519
- His pulse is weak.
- Garrett.

34:03.563 --> 34:04.564
- Step back.
Let her work.

34:04.607 --> 34:05.826
Let her work.

34:05.869 --> 34:06.827
- He's breathing.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.089
Let's get oxygen on him.

34:08.133 --> 34:11.440
- On it.

34:11.484 --> 34:15.401
[groaning]

34:15.444 --> 34:16.619
- Garrett, I'm right here.

34:16.663 --> 34:17.664
You're OK.

34:17.707 --> 34:20.101
[groaning]

34:20.145 --> 34:23.148
- We got a victim coming
out, pretty bad shape!

34:23.191 --> 34:30.155
- Hey, Michelle, get
this smoke inhalation.

34:31.156 --> 34:31.982
- All right.

34:32.026 --> 34:33.549
We need to intubate.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.421
Violet, give me an opening.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.292
- I'll try my best.

34:37.336 --> 34:40.687
[sighing]

34:40.730 --> 34:47.911
OK.

34:48.956 --> 34:56.137
OK, I think I got it.

35:05.799 --> 35:08.410
- I'm in.

35:08.454 --> 35:15.461
- Let's get him to Med.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.768
- Kylie said you
wanted to see me.

35:18.812 --> 35:21.989
- Come on in.

35:22.032 --> 35:23.686
- Something wrong?

35:23.730 --> 35:24.992
- Saw the assignment
that you gave

35:25.035 --> 35:26.689
to Carver during the call.

35:26.733 --> 35:29.736
He is capable of
much more than that.

35:29.779 --> 35:32.695
I hope you're not gonna let
your personal feelings for

35:32.739 --> 35:35.916
the man get in the way here.

35:35.959 --> 35:40.747
- I am not, I assure you.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.183
- Good.

35:42.227 --> 35:48.885
- So you know, Chief, I
was not sidelining him.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.628
He needs to know
his place on my rig.

35:52.672 --> 35:54.804
He has not proven
himself to me yet.

35:54.848 --> 35:56.197
Mouch and Gallo have.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.373
And I needed to see
if he would handle

35:58.417 --> 36:01.376
that well, which he did.

36:01.420 --> 36:05.119
You told me to take him
on board, and I did that.

36:05.163 --> 36:09.079
But now I respectfully ask
that you take a step back

36:09.123 --> 36:16.261
and let me lead him my way.

36:19.264 --> 36:26.532
- I can do that, but
just a small step.

36:27.968 --> 36:35.149
- Thank you, Chief.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.243
- Now, it was insane.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.940
The vinyl was melting
off the tent like cheese

36:43.984 --> 36:45.246
off a cooking pizza.
You know, just--

36:45.290 --> 36:46.334
[chuckling]

36:46.378 --> 36:48.293
- Yeah I'm yanking
out power cables,

36:48.336 --> 36:49.903
and suddenly Gallo busts out of
the tent, kid under each arm,

36:49.946 --> 36:51.252
like something out of a movie.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.123
- What do you think
of the new guy?

36:53.167 --> 36:55.561
- I haven't got
him figured yet.

36:55.604 --> 36:58.520
- Lieutenant, can we
get another round on me?

36:58.564 --> 37:00.000
- I like him so far.

37:00.043 --> 37:02.307
- Include this lovely
stranger over here.

37:02.350 --> 37:05.527
[chuckling]

37:05.571 --> 37:06.833
- Hey, Brett.

37:06.876 --> 37:08.226
- Hey.

37:08.269 --> 37:09.575
- How did it turn
out with the victim

37:09.618 --> 37:10.619
you and Violet brought to Med?

37:10.663 --> 37:17.278
- Um, he didn't make it.

37:17.322 --> 37:22.283
[chuckling]

37:22.327 --> 37:24.242
- This feels a little strange.

37:24.285 --> 37:30.987
- Mm, well, if by "strange"
you mean amazing, then yeah.

37:32.902 --> 37:33.903
- That's exactly what I meant.

37:33.947 --> 37:37.777
- Mm-hmm.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.039
- I got to go.

37:39.082 --> 37:40.083
- Well, you--you
just got here.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.302
- Yeah, and I--

37:41.346 --> 37:42.303
I got to--

37:42.347 --> 37:49.267
I got to take
care of something.

37:58.406 --> 38:01.191
- Pryma.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.541
- Look, I don't
know how you have

38:02.584 --> 38:04.934
so much pull inside
the department,

38:04.978 --> 38:07.589
but you just cost
me a useful CI.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.199
- Campbell's mole.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.637
- Danny Cavanaugh, everybody
knows his name now,

38:11.680 --> 38:13.203
so you may as well, too.

38:13.247 --> 38:14.901
He's been stripped of his
badge, facing charges.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.337
- Good.
- Like hell.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.557
He wasn't just
connected to Campbell.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.690
He could've helped us shut
down a major heroin pipeline,

38:21.734 --> 38:25.259
but he's burned now.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.695
- Got what he deserves.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.610
- He did.

38:28.654 --> 38:35.922
And you just lost yourself
a valuable friend.

38:36.749 --> 38:37.837
- You lost a friend?

38:37.880 --> 38:39.229
What is that?

38:39.273 --> 38:40.796
Is that--is that
some kind of threat?

38:40.840 --> 38:44.234
- Pfft, I doubt it.

38:44.278 --> 38:47.890
Pryma's a good man, but I--

38:47.934 --> 38:51.198
I couldn't back down
from this battle.

38:51.241 --> 38:55.898
- Yeah, I noticed.

38:55.942 --> 38:59.337
Is everything OK?

38:59.380 --> 39:06.213
- When I agreed to testify
and take Campbell down,

39:06.256 --> 39:10.739
I was only thinking
of the risk to myself.

39:10.783 --> 39:18.051
But we're married now, a team,
and after everything happened

39:19.400 --> 39:23.143
at the cabin, it hit me
hard that the moves I

39:23.186 --> 39:30.368
make affect you just as much.

39:31.325 --> 39:32.979
I could've gotten you killed.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.894
- Hey.

39:34.937 --> 39:37.418
Don't do that.

39:37.462 --> 39:41.030
I was with you every
step of the way.

39:41.074 --> 39:48.255
I always will be.

39:49.778 --> 39:52.564
- You sure about that?

39:52.607 --> 39:56.872
I mean, I did give you
the worst honeymoon ever.

39:56.916 --> 40:01.007
[laughs]

40:01.050 --> 40:04.445
- [sighing, clicking tongue]

40:04.489 --> 40:11.670
Every day I spend with
you is a honeymoon.

40:21.680 --> 40:28.643
- [sighing]

40:30.602 --> 40:35.433
- I know.

40:35.476 --> 40:39.654
Our stars just didn't align.

40:39.698 --> 40:43.441
That's all.

40:43.484 --> 40:50.622
The timing just wasn't right.

40:51.753 --> 40:57.542
But, Matt, maybe someday--

40:57.585 --> 41:04.549
[music playing]

41:38.104 --> 41:41.586
[wolf howling]
