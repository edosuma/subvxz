HEY STAN, WHERE'D YOU
GET THAT BLACK EYE?

00:38.132 --> 00:40.031
NOTHING,
I MEAN<i> NOWHERE.</i>

00:40.033 --> 00:42.234
YOUR SISTER
BEAT YOU UP AGAIN?

00:42.236 --> 00:42.801
NO!

00:42.803 --> 00:45.103
YOUR SISTER
KICKED YOUR ASS!

00:45.105 --> 00:47.739
SHE'S PISSED OFF 'CAUSE SHE GOT
HEADGEAR AT THE DENTIST.

00:47.741 --> 00:48.773
SHE'S TAKING IT
OUT ON<i> ME.</i>

00:48.775 --> 00:51.510
BUT THAT SUCKS YOU GET YOUR
BUTT KICKED BY A GIRL, STAN.

00:51.512 --> 00:53.979
I WOULD NEVER
LET A WOMAN KICK MY ASS.

00:53.981 --> 00:56.047
IF SHE TRIED ANYTHING,
I'D BE LIKE,

00:56.049 --> 00:59.217
"YOU GET YOUR BITCH-ASS
BACK IN THE KITCHEN

00:59.219 --> 01:00.652
AND MAKE ME
SOME PIE!"

01:00.654 --> 01:02.621
MY PARENTS DON'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT SHE BEATS ME UP.

01:02.623 --> 01:04.656
THEY THINK SHE'S ALL
INNOCENT AND SWEET.

01:04.658 --> 01:06.258
BUT I KNOW THAT
SHE'S AN EVIL BITCH.

01:06.260 --> 01:09.094
BE A MAN, STAN,
JUST SAY, "HEY WOMAN

01:09.096 --> 01:12.230
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH
AND MAKE BABIES!"

01:12.232 --> 01:15.200
HEY KYLE, WHAT'S THAT
ELEPHANT DOING?

01:15.202 --> 01:16.168
YOU MEAN
THIS ONE?

01:16.170 --> 01:17.636
HE'S MY NEW
PET ELEPHANT.

01:17.638 --> 01:19.871
WHERE'D YOU GET
A PET ELEPHANT?

01:19.873 --> 01:21.439
I GOT IT MAIL ORDER
FROM AFRICA.

01:21.441 --> 01:23.542
THE AD SAID IT WOULD
TAKE FOUR TO SIX WEEKS,

01:23.544 --> 01:25.043
BUT IT ONLY
TOOK THREE!

01:25.045 --> 01:26.178
WOW,
THAT'S COOL!

01:26.180 --> 01:26.912
NO, IT'S NOT COOL!

01:26.914 --> 01:28.613
MY MOM WON'T LET ME
KEEP HIM IN THE HOUSE!

01:28.615 --> 01:29.447
SHE SAYS
HE'S TOO BIG

01:29.449 --> 01:31.049
AND THAT HIS POOP
IS BIGGER THAN OUR COUCH.

01:31.051 --> 01:33.585
THAT'S WHY MY MOM GOT ME
A POT-BELLIED PIG,

01:33.587 --> 01:35.754
'CAUSE ITS
POOP IS<i> SMALL.</i>

01:35.756 --> 01:37.556
( mumbling )

01:37.558 --> 01:41.092
YEAH, BUT PIGS AREN'T
SMART LIKE ELEPHANTS.

01:42.129 --> 01:42.627
HEY!

01:42.629 --> 01:45.664
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT IS<i> THAT</i> THING?!

01:45.666 --> 01:49.201
THIS IS THE NEW
RETARDED KID.

01:49.870 --> 01:51.836
OH, I'M SORRY
LITTLE GIRL.

01:51.838 --> 01:53.939
BUT YOU STILL
CAN'T GET ON!

01:53.941 --> 01:57.475
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE SPECIAL-ED BUS!

01:57.477 --> 01:58.977
DUH!
DUH!

01:58.979 --> 02:01.813
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE NOT
WELCOME ANYWHERE, ELEPHANT.

02:01.815 --> 02:02.948
SEE YA!

02:02.950 --> 02:05.150
IF A WOMAN
GAVE ME CRAP,

02:05.152 --> 02:08.119
I'D SAY,
"YOU GO DO MY LAUNDRY!"

02:08.121 --> 02:10.021
SIT DOWN, KID!

02:10.023 --> 02:11.223
YES, MA'AM.

02:11.225 --> 02:13.592
AND NOW CHILDREN,
OUR FRIEND MR. HAT,

02:13.594 --> 02:17.195
IS GOING TO TELL US ALL ABOUT
GENETIC ENGINEERING.

02:17.197 --> 02:18.663
THAT'S RIGHT,
MR. GARRISON.

02:18.665 --> 02:22.033
GENETIC ENGINEERING IS
AN EXCITING NEW SCIENCE.

02:22.035 --> 02:24.903
YOU CAN SPLICE THE DNA
FROM SOME ANIMALS

02:24.905 --> 02:26.571
AND MAKE
THEM BETTER.

02:26.573 --> 02:27.606
MR. GARRISON?

02:27.608 --> 02:28.406
YES, KYLE.

02:28.408 --> 02:29.541
WITH GENETIC
ENGINEERING,

02:29.543 --> 02:31.042
CAN YOU MAKE
AN ELEPHANT SMALLER?

02:31.044 --> 02:33.945
WELL, YES,
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD.

02:33.947 --> 02:37.415
YOU COULD SPLICE ELEPHANT GENES
WITH A DOG OR CAT

02:37.417 --> 02:39.317
OR POT-BELLIED PIG GENES.

02:39.319 --> 02:39.884
THAT'S IT!

02:39.886 --> 02:42.187
I'M GONNA COMBINE MY ELEPHANT
WITH A POT-BELLIED PIG

02:42.189 --> 02:43.588
AND MAKE POT-BELLIED
ELEPHANTS.

02:43.590 --> 02:46.024
THEY'D BE SMART
LIKE ELEPHANTS,

02:46.026 --> 02:47.492
BUT SMALL LIKE PIGS.

02:47.494 --> 02:48.460
THAT'D BE COOL!

02:48.462 --> 02:49.527
I'D WANT A
POT-BELLIED ELEPHANT.

02:49.529 --> 02:51.663
YES, I'LL PAY
$50 FOR ONE.

02:51.665 --> 02:52.831
THAT'S STUPID.

02:52.833 --> 02:53.365
SHUT UP!

02:53.367 --> 02:55.367
WE COULD GENETICAL ENGINEER
ANYTHING WE WANT.

02:55.369 --> 02:57.636
I BET I COULD CLONE
A HUMAN BEING

02:57.638 --> 03:00.472
BEFORE YOU CROSSBREED
AN ELEPHANT AND A PIG.

03:00.474 --> 03:01.606
I'LL BET
YOU CAN'T!

03:01.608 --> 03:02.440
WATCH ME,
PLEBEIAN.

03:02.442 --> 03:04.743
WELL, SPANK MY ASS
AND CALL ME CHARLIE.

03:04.745 --> 03:05.944
ISN'T THIS EXCITING?

03:05.946 --> 03:08.079
TWO "A+" STUDENTS
IN A CLONING WAR.

03:08.081 --> 03:09.147
YES, MR. GARRISON.

03:09.149 --> 03:11.082
GENETIC ENGINEERING
LET'S US CORRECT

03:11.084 --> 03:13.184
GOD'S HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE MISTAKES,

03:13.186 --> 03:13.952
LIKE GERMAN PEOPLE.

03:13.954 --> 03:16.888
YOU BOYS MIGHT WANNA VISIT
THE GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH

03:16.890 --> 03:19.024
OUTSIDE OF TOWN
FOR SOME HELP.

03:19.026 --> 03:20.158
AND YOU COULD
BOTH USE THIS

03:20.160 --> 03:23.328
FOR YOUR SCIENCE FAIR
PROJECTS NEXT MONTH.

03:24.598 --> 03:26.298
GENETIC
ENGINEERING RANCH?

03:26.300 --> 03:26.765
SWEET!

03:26.767 --> 03:28.099
WAIT, WAIT,
WE STILL NEED A PIG.

03:28.101 --> 03:29.267
WE COULD USE
CARTMAN'S PIGS.

03:29.269 --> 03:31.503
YOU LEAVE FLUFFY
OUT OF THIS!

03:31.505 --> 03:32.637
WE'RE NOT GONNA
HURT HER.

03:32.639 --> 03:33.672
WE JUST NEED
SOME OF HER BLOOD.

03:33.674 --> 03:35.640
YOU'RE NOT USING
ANY OF FLUFFY'S BLOOD!

03:35.642 --> 03:37.542
I'LL KICK YOU
IN THE NUTS!

03:37.544 --> 03:39.044
KYLE, KYLE, NO!

03:39.046 --> 03:41.646
STANLEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

03:41.648 --> 03:42.047
OKAY.

03:42.049 --> 03:43.915
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICE
THAT BLACK EYE.

03:43.917 --> 03:46.484
ARE THERE
PROBLEMS AT HOME?

03:46.486 --> 03:47.686
YES.

03:47.688 --> 03:48.720
OH, DEAR.

03:48.722 --> 03:50.789
HERE STANLEY,
SIT DOWN,

03:50.791 --> 03:51.623
HAVE SOME COCOA,

03:51.625 --> 03:53.992
AND TELL YOUR FRIEND
MR. HAT ALL ABOUT IT.

03:53.994 --> 03:55.927
I'M YOUR FRIEND,
MR. HAT, STAN,

03:55.929 --> 03:57.929
YOU CAN
TELL ME ANYTHING.

03:57.931 --> 03:59.364
NOW WHO HIT YOU?

03:59.366 --> 04:01.666
IS IT YOUR FATHER
OR YOUR MOTHER?

04:01.668 --> 04:04.002
NEITHER,
IT'S MY SISTER.

04:04.004 --> 04:04.803
YOUR SISTER?!

04:04.805 --> 04:06.571
OH FOR PETE'S SAKE,
DON'T BE SUCH A LITTLE WUS!

04:06.573 --> 04:10.308
STOP WASTING MR. HAT'S TIME
WITH PANSY LITTLE FU-FU PROBLEMS

04:10.310 --> 04:12.911
AND GIVE ME BACK
MY COCOA!

04:20.387 --> 04:22.020
HEY!

04:24.791 --> 04:25.357
HI, SHELLY.

04:25.359 --> 04:26.825
ARE YOU LOOKING
AT MY HEADGEAR?

04:26.827 --> 04:28.126
HEADGEAR,
WHAT HEADGEAR?

04:28.128 --> 04:29.861
ARE YOU LOOKING
AT MY HEADGEAR?!

04:29.863 --> 04:32.163
GOSH, I DIDN'T
REALLY NOTICE.

04:32.165 --> 04:33.531
YOU LITTLE LIAR!

04:33.533 --> 04:35.567
NO, I THINK
IT LOOKS TERRIFIC!

04:35.569 --> 04:37.802
IT MATCHES YOUR--
AAH...!

04:39.373 --> 04:41.339
AAH...!

04:52.886 --> 04:54.419
READY TO GO,
STAN?

04:54.421 --> 04:54.953
GO WHERE?

04:54.955 --> 04:56.654
TO THE GENETICAL
ENGINEERING RANCH.

04:56.656 --> 04:57.489
WE GOT
CARTMAN'S PIG,

04:57.491 --> 04:59.190
SO WE CAN SPLICE ITS GENES
WITH MY ELEPHANT.

04:59.192 --> 05:01.426
NOBODY'S SPLICING
NOTHING FROM FLUFFY!

05:01.428 --> 05:04.295
( Shelly )
I SWEAR I'M GONNA
KILL YOU, STAN!

05:04.297 --> 05:05.897
WHY IS YOUR SISTER
SO MEAN TO YOU, DUDE?

05:05.899 --> 05:08.967
YEAH, IF SOME SISSY CHICK
TRIED TO KICK MY ASS,

05:08.969 --> 05:11.970
I BE LIKE,
HEY, LISTEN MISSY,

05:11.972 --> 05:14.506
WHY DON'T YOU GO
KNIT ME A SWEATER

05:14.508 --> 05:16.741
BEFORE I SLAP YOU
IN THE FACE?!

05:16.743 --> 05:18.576
WHO SAID THAT?

05:24.484 --> 05:25.417
THIS MUST BE IT.

05:25.419 --> 05:27.519
LOOKS LIKE
NOBODY'S HOME.

05:27.521 --> 05:29.554
GUESS WE SHOULD COME BACK
SOME OTHER TIME.

05:29.556 --> 05:30.989
NO, CARTMAN,
WE'RE GOING IN THERE

05:30.991 --> 05:32.690
AND SPLICING FLUFFY
AND MY ELEPHANT TOGETHER.

05:32.692 --> 05:35.560
IT'S OKAY, FLUFFY,
I WON'T LET THEM HURT YOU.

05:35.562 --> 05:36.961
IT'S JUST
A STUPID PIG.

05:36.963 --> 05:37.796
QUIT BEING
SUCH A BABY.

05:37.798 --> 05:40.999
WELL AT LEAST I DON'T GET
MY ASS KICKED BY A GIRL!

05:41.001 --> 05:42.534
AT LEAST I'M NOT
A LITTLE PIG--

05:42.536 --> 05:45.970
I'M TAKING MY PIG,
AND SCREW YOU GUYS!

05:45.972 --> 05:46.805
I'M GOING HOME!

05:46.807 --> 05:48.406
THIS WHOLE IDEA
IS STUPID ANYWAY!

05:48.408 --> 05:50.809
WHAT THE HELL WOULD YOU KNOW?
YOU FAT SWEATY MONGOLOID.

05:50.811 --> 05:52.377
YOU NEVER GET
HIGHER THAN A "D"!

05:52.379 --> 05:54.612
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO SAN FRANCISCO

05:54.614 --> 05:55.914
WITH THE REST
OF THE JEWS!

05:55.916 --> 05:59.017
THERE'S NO JEWS IN
SAN FRANCISCO YOU RETARD!

05:59.019 --> 06:01.886
I'LL KICK YOU
IN THE NUTS!

06:01.888 --> 06:03.922
CAN I HELP YOU?

06:06.193 --> 06:07.192
UH, YEAH.

06:07.194 --> 06:09.561
WE WANNA CROSSBREED
AN ELEPHANT WITH A PIG.

06:09.563 --> 06:10.962
BRILLIANT IDEA.

06:10.964 --> 06:12.464
HUGE ELEPHANT-SIZED PIGS.

06:12.466 --> 06:15.033
NO, WE WANNA MAKE LITTLE
POT-BELLIED ELEPHANTS

06:15.035 --> 06:17.101
THAT PEOPLE CAN KEEP
IN THEIR HOUSES AS PETS.

06:17.103 --> 06:19.270
THAT'S AN EVEN
BETTER IDEA.

06:19.272 --> 06:20.104
COME ON IN.

06:20.106 --> 06:22.841
I'M SO PLEASED THAT
YOU CHILDREN ARE INTERESTED

06:22.843 --> 06:23.942
IN GENETIC ENGINEERING.

06:23.944 --> 06:26.744
IT'S OKAY, FLUFFY,
NOBODY'S GONNA HURT YOU.

06:26.746 --> 06:29.214
IT'S THANKS TO THE WONDERS
OF GENETIC ENGINEERING

06:29.216 --> 06:31.449
THAT SOON THERE WILL BE
AN END TO HUNGER,

06:31.451 --> 06:34.052
DISEASE, POLLUTION,
EVEN WAR.

06:34.054 --> 06:35.153
I'VE CREATED THINGS

06:35.155 --> 06:37.388
THAT WILL CHANGE
THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER.

06:37.390 --> 06:38.356
FOR INSTANCE,

06:38.358 --> 06:40.959
HERE'S A MONKEY
WITH FOUR ASSES.

06:41.728 --> 06:42.961
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE THE WORLD BETTER?

06:42.963 --> 06:45.897
AND HERE OF COURSE,
IS MY FOUR-ASSED OSTRICH,

06:45.899 --> 06:47.365
AND MY FOUR-ASSED
MONGOOSE.

06:47.367 --> 06:50.268
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING BESIDES
ANIMALS WITH FOUR ASSES?

06:50.270 --> 06:52.537
OH, WELL,
I SUPPOSE SO.

06:52.539 --> 06:54.172
OH, YES,
OVER HERE.

06:54.174 --> 06:56.774
HERE I HAVE RATS
SPLICED WITH DUCKS.

06:56.776 --> 06:58.810
AND GORILLAS SPLICED
WITH MOSQUITOES.

06:58.812 --> 07:01.913
AND HERE I HAVE RABBITS
SPLICED WITH FISH

07:01.915 --> 07:03.147
TO MAKE
LITTLE BUNNY FISH.

07:03.149 --> 07:06.217
THESE BUNNY EARS ARE TIED ON
WITH LITTLE STRINGS!

07:06.219 --> 07:09.888
AND OVER HERE SWISS CHEESE
SPLICED WITH CHALK

07:09.890 --> 07:10.788
AND A BEARD.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.257
WHAT ABOUT OUR
POT-BELLIED ELEPHANT?

07:12.259 --> 07:14.425
OH, WELL,
I'M SORRY, CHILDREN.

07:14.427 --> 07:17.562
BUT PIG AND ELEPHANT DNA
JUST WON'T SPLICE.

07:17.564 --> 07:20.398
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD
THAT SONG BY LOVERBOY?

07:20.400 --> 07:21.232
WHICH SONG
IS THAT?

07:21.234 --> 07:25.637
♪ PIG AND ELEPHANT DNA
JUST WON'T SPLICE ♪

07:25.639 --> 07:28.806
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU
ADD A FEW ASSES
TO THAT SWINE OF YOURS.

07:28.808 --> 07:31.509
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF
OF<i> FLUFFY'S</i> ASS!

07:31.511 --> 07:33.211
IT'S AMAZING
WHAT WE CAN DO

07:33.213 --> 07:35.613
WITH A LITTLE
BLOOD SAMPLE THESE DAYS.

07:35.615 --> 07:36.981
OW!

07:36.983 --> 07:38.049
WHAT?
EXCUSE ME.

07:38.051 --> 07:40.118
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU TAKING
STAN'S BLOOD FOR?

07:40.120 --> 07:41.753
OH, PARDON ME,
I TRIPPED.

07:41.755 --> 07:43.087
COULD I HAVE SOME
HAIR, PLEASE?

07:43.089 --> 07:45.423
WATCH OUT, STAN,
GENETIC ENGINEERS ARE CRAZY!

07:45.425 --> 07:47.892
C'MON, FLUFFY!

07:50.897 --> 07:53.298
THIS QUICHE IS JUST
??

07:53.300 --> 07:54.499
THAT'S
PRETTY FRESH.

07:54.501 --> 07:56.768
OH, I SURE AM
HUNGRY.

07:56.770 --> 07:57.468
'ELLO, GENTLEMEN.

07:57.470 --> 08:00.104
ANY OF YOU BLOKES
KNOW WHAT'S FOR LUNCH?

08:01.641 --> 08:03.675
LUNCHY MUNCHIES, HMM?

08:03.677 --> 08:05.543
GO AWAY, PIP,
NOBODY LIKES YOU!

08:05.545 --> 08:07.445
YEAH, WHAT KIND OF NAME
IS "PIP" ANYWAY?

08:07.447 --> 08:09.581
MY FATHER'S FAMILY NAME
BEING "PHILLIP"

08:09.583 --> 08:11.449
AND MY CHRISTIAN NAME
"PHILLIP"--

08:11.451 --> 08:13.551
WOULD YOU
SHUT THE HELL UP?!

08:13.553 --> 08:15.286
NOBODY GIVES
A RAT'S ASS!

08:15.288 --> 08:16.654
YEAH,
GO AWAY PIP.

08:16.656 --> 08:18.089
RIGHT-O.

08:18.625 --> 08:20.525
FRENCH PEOPLE
PISS ME OFF.

08:20.527 --> 08:21.326
HEY, DUMB ASSES!

08:21.328 --> 08:24.295
YOU MORONS GIVE UP ON YOUR
STUPID SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT?

08:24.297 --> 08:26.164
NO, WE'RE ALREADY
HALFWAY DONE.

08:26.166 --> 08:29.634
THEN ALL<i> YOU'VE</i> GOT
IS A STUPID PIG.

08:29.636 --> 08:32.136
PROBABLY
A GAY PIG, TOO.

08:32.138 --> 08:33.638
IT'S MORE THAN
<i>YOU'VE</i> GOT!

08:33.640 --> 08:34.205
WRONG!

08:34.207 --> 08:37.275
WE ALREADY GOT
OUR CLONE UNDER WAY.

08:37.711 --> 08:39.978
OH, MY GOD,
THEY CLONED A FOOT!

08:39.980 --> 08:43.114
HEY, I'LL
KICK YOUR ASS!

08:44.551 --> 08:47.051
BY FRIDAY WE'RE GONNA CLONE
A WHOLE HUMAN BEING.

08:47.053 --> 08:49.454
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR
STUPID LITTLE PIG.

08:49.456 --> 08:50.722
HELLO THERE,
CHILDREN.

08:50.724 --> 08:51.255
HEY, CHEF.

08:51.257 --> 08:52.490
HOW YOU DOING?

08:52.492 --> 08:53.291
BAD.
BAD.

08:53.293 --> 08:53.891
WHY?

08:53.893 --> 08:56.060
WE NEED TO GENETICALLY ENGINEER
A PIG AND AN ELEPHANT,

08:56.062 --> 08:57.228
BUT THEIR GENES
WON'T SPLICE.

08:57.230 --> 08:59.397
OF COURSE THEY
WON'T SPLICE, CHILDREN.

08:59.399 --> 09:02.233
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
THAT SONG BY LOVERBOY?

09:02.235 --> 09:06.237
♪ PIG AND AN ELEPHANT DNA
JUST WON'T-- ♪

09:06.239 --> 09:07.138
A PIG-ELEPHANT?

09:07.140 --> 09:10.742
SAY, THAT'S NOT
A BAD IDEA.

09:10.744 --> 09:11.676
I TOLD YOU GUYS.

09:11.678 --> 09:14.112
IMAGINE A PINT-SIZED
ELEPHANT

09:14.114 --> 09:15.947
THAT YOU COULD
KEEP IN THE HOUSE.

09:15.949 --> 09:19.117
CHILDREN, WE COULD MAKE
A<i> FORTUNE</i> WITH THIS.

09:19.119 --> 09:20.818
YOU HEAR THAT, DUDES?
WE'LL BE RICH!

09:20.820 --> 09:23.621
FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT
GENETIC ENGINEERING<i> HOOSAFUDGE.</i>

09:23.623 --> 09:26.090
IF YOU WANT TO COMBINE
A PIG AND AN ELEPHANT

09:26.092 --> 09:29.093
JUST GET THEM
TO MAKE SWEET LOVE.

09:29.095 --> 09:32.030
I DON'T THINK AN ELEPHANT
WOULD MAKE LOVE TO A PIG.

09:32.032 --> 09:32.997
I DON'T THINK
MY PIG

09:32.999 --> 09:35.533
WOULD WANNA MAKE LOVE
TO THAT STUPID ELEPHANT!

09:35.535 --> 09:36.367
SURE,
THEY WOULD.

09:36.369 --> 09:38.503
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET 'EM IN THE MOOD.

09:38.505 --> 09:39.771
HOW DO WE
DO THAT?

09:39.773 --> 09:43.007
DO WHAT I DO,
GET 'EM GOOD AND DRUNK.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.376
YOU GUYS WANNA COME OVER
TO MY HOUSE?

09:45.378 --> 09:46.277
WE GOT WORK
TO DO, STAN.

09:46.279 --> 09:48.146
I THINK IT TAKES A WHILE
FOR AN ELEPHANT TO GET DRUNK.

09:48.148 --> 09:50.782
YOU DON'T WANNA COME OVER
FOR A LITTLE BIT?

09:50.784 --> 09:53.384
WHY, YOUR SISTER GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS AGAIN?

09:53.386 --> 09:54.652
SHUT UP,
CARTMAN!

09:54.654 --> 09:55.553
( mumbling )

09:55.555 --> 09:57.188
YEAH, STAN,
SHE'S JUST A<i> GIRL.</i>

09:57.190 --> 09:59.857
YEAH, IF SOME GIRL
TRIED TO KICK MY ASS

09:59.859 --> 10:01.025
I'D BE LIKE, HEY!

10:01.027 --> 10:04.462
WHY DON'T YOU STOP
DRESSING ME UP LIKE A MAILMAN

10:04.464 --> 10:06.330
AND MAKING ME
DANCE FOR YOU

10:06.332 --> 10:08.833
WHILE YOU GO AND SMOKE CRACK
IN YOUR BEDROOM

10:08.835 --> 10:11.969
AND HAVE SEX WITH SOME GUY
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

10:11.971 --> 10:13.938
ON MY DAD'S BED?!

10:16.342 --> 10:18.576
CARTMAN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

10:18.578 --> 10:21.145
I'M JUST SAYING YOU'RE
A LITTLE WUS, THAT'S ALL.

10:21.147 --> 10:24.515
STAN, YOU CAN USE FAMILY LOVE
AS A WEAPON AGAINST SHELLY.

10:24.517 --> 10:25.783
THE NEXT TIME SHE'S GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS,

10:25.785 --> 10:28.753
JUST TELL HER,
"SHELLY, YOU'RE MY SISTER
AND I LOVE YOU."

10:28.755 --> 10:31.823
SICK, DUDE,
SHE'S MY SISTER!

10:31.825 --> 10:32.490
TRY IT.

10:32.492 --> 10:33.991
WE GOTTA GO
GET CARTMAN'S PIG.

10:33.993 --> 10:36.194
NO YOU DON'T GOTTA GET
CARTMAN'S PIG!

10:36.196 --> 10:37.895
YOU LEAVE FLUFFY
OUT OF THIS!

10:37.897 --> 10:38.796
C'MON, KENNY!

10:38.798 --> 10:39.497
KYLE, NO!

10:39.499 --> 10:41.999
NO ELEPHANT IS GONNA
MAKE LOVE TO FLUFFY!

10:42.001 --> 10:45.269
I WILL KICK YOU
IN THE NUTS!

10:45.705 --> 10:47.171
CRAP!

10:47.173 --> 10:49.874
( television )
And now back to
Jesus and pals...

10:49.876 --> 10:52.643
ARE YOU STARING
AT MY NECK BRACE?

10:52.645 --> 10:53.978
NO, I MEAN YES?

10:53.980 --> 10:56.147
I MEAN,
WHAT NECK BRACE?

10:56.483 --> 10:59.751
SHELLY, BEFORE YOU BEAT MY FACE
INTO A BLOODY PULP AGAIN,

10:59.753 --> 11:01.119
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW

11:01.121 --> 11:04.122
THAT YOU'RE MY SISTER
AND I LOVE YOU.

11:07.093 --> 11:08.126
OW!

11:08.128 --> 11:10.595
SOMEDAY I'M GONNA
BE BIGGER THAN YOU

11:10.597 --> 11:13.798
AND YOU'RE GONNA WISH YOU'D
NEVER DONE ANY OF THIS.

11:13.800 --> 11:17.602
YOU'LL NEVER BE BIGGER
THAN ME, STAN.

11:17.604 --> 11:19.537
NEVER!

11:19.939 --> 11:23.007
BEAUTIFUL,
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

11:23.009 --> 11:26.144
MY SON, I THINK
WE'VE FINALLY DONE IT.

11:26.146 --> 11:27.478
YES, WE HAVE, DAD.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.647
MY VERY OWN
HUMAN CLONE.

11:29.649 --> 11:31.582
HOPE IT'S NOT
A GAY CLONE.

11:31.584 --> 11:33.351
YEAH.

11:33.353 --> 11:34.685
THIS SHOW'S
STUPID.

11:34.687 --> 11:36.053
C'MON, ELEPHANT,
KEEP DRINKING.

11:36.055 --> 11:37.755
I WONDER HOW DRUNK
HE NEEDS TO BE

11:37.757 --> 11:40.691
TO MAKE SWEET LOVE
TO THE PIG.

11:43.329 --> 11:45.263
DAMNIT, THIS IS
NEVER GONNA WORK!

11:45.265 --> 11:46.264
HELLO, CHILDREN.

11:46.266 --> 11:47.198
I THOUGHT
I'D CHECK AND SEE

11:47.200 --> 11:51.068
HOW OUR LITTLE ENTREPRENEURIAL
ADVENTURE IS GOING.

11:51.070 --> 11:51.569
ROTTEN!

11:51.571 --> 11:53.704
THEY'RE BOTH DRUNK
BUT WON'T HAVE SEX!

11:53.706 --> 11:54.705
OH, CHILDREN,

11:54.707 --> 11:57.708
YOU CAN'T STICK A DRUNK PIG
WITH A DRUNK ELEPHANT

11:57.710 --> 12:01.112
AND EXPECT THEM
TO DO THE MATTRESS MAMBO.

12:01.114 --> 12:02.446
YOU NEED TO
SET THE MOOD.

HAS ONE ASS!

13:29.936 --> 13:33.204
HE'S OF NO USE TO ME,
I'LL HAVE TO BURN THE ROOM!

13:34.574 --> 13:35.606
OH, NO.

13:35.608 --> 13:39.143
THIS ENTIRE EXPERIMENT
IS TURNING OUT VERY BAD.

13:39.145 --> 13:40.912
ME BAD?

13:42.582 --> 13:44.782
<i>EGATS,</i> HE'S
OUT OF CONTROL.

13:44.784 --> 13:45.917
WE'LL HAVE
TO DESTROY HIM!

13:45.919 --> 13:48.119
BUT HE'S OUR
SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT!

13:48.121 --> 13:51.055
( jibberish )

13:51.057 --> 13:52.356
HE'S TOO
DANGEROUS, SON.

13:52.358 --> 13:55.526
BUT, DAD,
I WANT A HUMAN CLONE!

13:55.528 --> 13:57.061
SON, NO!

13:59.732 --> 14:02.199

A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

14:02.201 --> 14:05.102
YOU'VE PUT ALL THE PEOPLE
OF SOUTH PARK IN JEOPARDY!

14:05.104 --> 14:06.837
THEY'RE ALL

14:06.839 --> 14:08.773

LET'S GO.

14:08.775 --> 14:11.008
THEY'RE ALL GAY.

14:11.444 --> 14:13.411
AREN'T THEY EVER
GONNA WAKE UP?

14:13.413 --> 14:14.545
OH, THEY WILL.

14:14.547 --> 14:16.747
IT'S GONNA BE
ONE UGLY SIGHT.

14:16.749 --> 14:18.983
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THE WONDER OF MOTHER NATURE

14:18.985 --> 14:19.750
WAS A
BEAUTIFUL THING.

14:19.752 --> 14:22.086
WHEN DOES MOTHER NATURE
GO FROM BEAUTIFUL TO UGLY?

14:22.088 --> 14:25.756
USUALLY ABOUT 9:30
IN THE MORNING, CHILDREN.

14:26.893 --> 14:29.193
UH-OH,
HERE WE GO.

14:32.465 --> 14:35.132
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN
GETTING ALL DRUNK

14:35.134 --> 14:38.135
AND WAKING UP THE NEXT MORNING
NEXT TO A PIG!

14:40.440 --> 14:41.572
OR A BIG FAT
ELEPHANT.

14:41.574 --> 14:43.307
HEY, HOW DO WE KNOW
IF SHE'S PREGNANT?

14:43.309 --> 14:46.577
WE MIGHT NOT KNOW
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

14:46.579 --> 14:47.278
COUPLE OF DAYS?

14:47.280 --> 14:50.381
BUT TERRANCE IS GOING TO HAVE
HIS HUMAN CLONE BY TOMORROW.

14:50.383 --> 14:51.449
GOOD JOB,
EINSTEIN!

14:51.451 --> 14:53.551
WHY DON'T WE JUST BUILD

14:53.553 --> 14:55.252
THANK BUDDHA
I FOUND YOU BOYS.

14:55.254 --> 14:58.155

SEEN ANYTHING ODD LATELY?

14:58.157 --> 15:01.425
WE SAW AN ELEPHANT
HAVE SEX WITH A PIG.

15:01.427 --> 15:02.593
NO, I SAID<i> ODD.</i>

15:02.595 --> 15:05.329
YOU'RE THAT CRAZY CRACKER
FROM UP ON THE HILL.

15:05.331 --> 15:09.367
SIR, IF MAKING MUTANT ANIMALS
SPLICED WITH HUMANS

15:09.369 --> 15:11.969
IS CRAZY THAN--

15:11.971 --> 15:13.704
UH...

15:14.240 --> 15:15.740
HMM...

15:15.742 --> 15:16.807
NEVERMIND.

15:16.809 --> 15:19.343
THERE'S BEEN A BIT
OF AN INCIDENT AT THE RANCH.

15:19.345 --> 15:21.979
YOU SEE, I'VE CREATED
A LARGE MUTANT CLONE

15:21.981 --> 15:23.581
OF THAT
LITTLE BOY THERE

15:23.583 --> 15:25.182
AND HE'S BROKEN FREE.

15:25.184 --> 15:27.018
( mumbling )

15:27.020 --> 15:28.519
A BIG MUTANT
VERSION OF<i> ME</i>?

15:28.521 --> 15:30.054
IS HE BIGGER
THAN A REGULAR CLONE?

15:30.056 --> 15:31.789
HE'S TERRIBLY
DANGEROUS.

15:31.791 --> 15:33.891
HIS BRAIN
IS IDENTICAL TO YOURS.

15:33.893 --> 15:36.227
I NEED<i> YOU</i>
TO HELP ME FIND HIM.

15:36.229 --> 15:38.763
( crowd screaming )

15:40.233 --> 15:43.768
STAN, ARE YOU WEARING
A DIFFERENT HAT?

15:45.271 --> 15:45.770
HEY!

15:45.772 --> 15:49.907
I KNOW A CERTAIN YOUNG MAN
WHO'S ITCHING FOR DETENTION!

15:52.612 --> 15:54.078
HOW BIG DO YOU
THINK HE IS?

15:54.080 --> 15:55.079
I BET HE WEIGHS
400 POUNDS!

15:55.081 --> 15:58.149
C'MON, STAN, DON'T YOU EVEN KNOW
WHERE YOU WOULD GO?

15:58.151 --> 16:00.684
OH, MY GOD!

16:01.821 --> 16:04.422
It appears that the horrible
destructive creature

16:04.424 --> 16:07.525
is actually eight-year-old
Stan Marsh of South Park.

16:07.527 --> 16:11.362
When asked why he was wreaking
such havoc on his hometown

16:11.364 --> 16:15.166
The little boy replied simply,
"Me Stan...

16:15.168 --> 16:17.301
( jibberish )

16:17.303 --> 16:18.869
Back to you
in the studio.

16:18.871 --> 16:20.504
THANKS, TOM,
POLICE ARE REQUESTING

16:20.506 --> 16:22.206
THAT IF YOU SEE THIS
LITTLE 8-YEAR-OLD BOY

16:22.208 --> 16:24.542
YOU IMMEDIATELY KILL HIM
AND BURN HIS BODY.

16:24.544 --> 16:25.342
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

16:25.344 --> 16:27.411
AND NOW BACK TO
"JESUS AND PALS".

16:27.413 --> 16:31.515
THE WAY IS PAVED WITH GOLD
FOR YE WHO SEEK TRUTH.

16:32.318 --> 16:34.752
( jibberish )

16:34.754 --> 16:36.487
JESUS!

16:37.790 --> 16:40.991
OFFICER, MY EVIL GENETIC CLONE
IS DESTROYING THE TOWN!

16:40.993 --> 16:41.826
WE HAVE
TO FIND HIM!

16:41.828 --> 16:44.695
YOU BOYS HAVE BEEN WATCHING
"THE X-FILES" TOO MUCH.

16:44.697 --> 16:47.398
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS GENETIC CLONE--!

16:48.901 --> 16:51.335
( gargled speech )

16:52.538 --> 16:54.305
C'MON,
LET'S GO!

16:54.307 --> 16:55.072
THERE YOU ARE!

16:55.074 --> 16:57.908
STANLEY, YOU TORE UP
MY ENTIRE GUN SHOP!

16:57.910 --> 16:59.944
YOU BETTER HAVE
A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THIS!

16:59.946 --> 17:03.414
IT WASN'T ME UNCLE JIMBO,
IT WAS MY EVIL GENETIC CLONE.

17:03.416 --> 17:05.983
STANLEY, WHAT THE HELL
HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?!

17:05.985 --> 17:08.385
YOU HAVE GOT SEVERE
LUNCHROOM DUTY, MISTER!

17:08.387 --> 17:11.255
I'M GONNA GO HAVE A WORD
WITH YOUR FATHER, STANLEY!

17:11.257 --> 17:14.258
YOU WAIT 'TILL YOUR FATHER
HEARS ABOUT THIS.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.293
WAIT, STAN,
THERE HE GOES.

17:16.996 --> 17:18.596
STOP!

17:18.965 --> 17:20.631
( jibberish )

17:20.633 --> 17:22.099
HE RECOGNIZES YOU, DUDE.

SHELLY'S THE ONE WITH THE
BIG WIRE COMING OUT OF HER MOUTH

17:42.822 --> 17:44.221
AND A METAL PLATE

SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

20:00.326 --> 20:02.559
TODAY YOU'VE TAUGHT ME
THE MEANING OF FAMILY.

20:02.561 --> 20:04.428
SURE, FAMILIES
DON'T ALWAYS GET ALONG

20:04.430 --> 20:06.497
BUT WHEN THE FORCES OF EVIL
DESCEND UPON US

20:06.499 --> 20:09.199
WE CONQUER THEM
BY STICKING TOGETHER.

20:24.550 --> 20:25.149
OKAY, KYLE,

20:25.151 --> 20:27.151
WE'RE READY TO SEE
YOUR SCIENCE PROJECT.

20:27.153 --> 20:29.219
WELL, OUR PIG HASN'T
GIVEN BIRTH YET,

20:29.221 --> 20:30.621
BUT SHE SHOULD
