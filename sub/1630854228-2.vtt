Or I could stick
to your system.

07:39.127 --> 07:41.071
- Good. Now I'm going
to take these down

07:41.171 --> 07:43.314
before Connor gets tangled up
in your sports bras.

07:43.414 --> 07:46.118
- Well, let me do that.
I can throw it into the dryer.

07:46.218 --> 07:47.360
- Do you know
where the laundry room is?

07:47.460 --> 07:48.883
- Of course I do.

07:48.983 --> 07:51.607
It's... upstairs or downstairs?

07:51.707 --> 07:52.889
Is this downstairs?

07:52.989 --> 07:54.652
- Goodbye.

07:54.752 --> 07:56.214
- Okay.

07:56.314 --> 07:58.818
I have a few ideas to show you
in my portfolio,

07:58.918 --> 08:00.981
including the portfolio.
It's new.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.786
- Ooh, that is quite
a strong folio.

08:03.886 --> 08:05.669
- Okay.
Let's talk color palette.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.311
There's too much pink
and purple.

08:07.411 --> 08:10.156
I'm thinking cool neutrals
like this dove gray.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.000
- Hmm.
- Modern with clean lines,

08:13.100 --> 08:15.324
but still playful and inviting.

08:15.424 --> 08:17.427
- Hmm.

08:18.148 --> 08:21.814
- My overall goal
is to make the room feel fun

08:21.914 --> 08:23.817
and perfect
for the modern pre-teen.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.920
- Hmm.

08:27.242 --> 08:30.787
- Any additional feedback?

08:30.887 --> 08:33.351
- I like it.
I definitely like it.

08:33.451 --> 08:36.156
But do I like it?

08:36.256 --> 08:38.600
- Oh. Okay.

08:38.700 --> 08:41.564
Um, well, it's important
that you do like it.

08:41.664 --> 08:44.208
Yeah, you're my client,
and I wanna make you happy.

08:44.308 --> 08:45.851
- Perfect.
I love how easy this is.

08:45.951 --> 08:47.413
- Yeah.
Let me give it a rethink,

08:47.513 --> 08:49.256
and I'll show you
some new ideas.

08:49.356 --> 08:50.979
- Cool.
- Is there anything

08:51.079 --> 08:53.062
from this first pass
that you would like to keep?

08:53.162 --> 08:55.025
- From this first pass?
- Mm-hmm.

08:55.125 --> 08:57.349
- Hmm.

08:57.449 --> 08:58.871
I did say I like the folio,
right?

08:58.971 --> 08:59.872
- You did.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.154
- And I meant it.

09:01.254 --> 09:02.917
- Sour Takes!

09:03.017 --> 09:04.880
- What up?
It's your boy, Derek Chen,

09:04.980 --> 09:06.843
and you are watching
"Sour Takes."

09:06.943 --> 09:08.205
Today we're with Tom.

09:08.305 --> 09:09.527
He's the author
of a new novel,

09:09.627 --> 09:10.929
"Home Economics."

09:11.029 --> 09:12.492
Tom, tell us about your book.

09:12.592 --> 09:14.695
- Well, it's a story inspired
by my own family

09:14.795 --> 09:16.418
and how we navigate
the three distinct economic--

09:16.518 --> 09:17.980
- Tom. Tom.
You gotta do that over again.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.663
You gotta eat the lemon, man.

09:19.763 --> 09:22.307
- Right. The... lemon.

09:22.407 --> 09:24.030
- Yeah, that's why we sent you
all the food.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.672
It's called "Sour Takes"
for a reason, dude.

09:25.772 --> 09:27.775
- Ah.

09:29.418 --> 09:31.041
Whoa. Whoa!

09:31.141 --> 09:33.484
All right.
Um, well, it's a story--

09:33.584 --> 09:35.287
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

09:35.387 --> 09:37.050
- It's a story that's
inspired--hmm, wow.

09:37.150 --> 09:38.372
- Spit it out, Tom.

09:42.077 --> 09:43.740
I swear I'm sweating mezcal.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.543

in a downtown loft

09:45.643 --> 09:47.646
in a unitard
and a feather boa.

09:49.529 --> 09:51.352
- Sorry, are we recording?

09:51.452 --> 09:52.874
- This is our intro.
We just talk about our nights.

09:52.974 --> 09:53.956
What'd you do?
- Oh, me?

09:54.056 --> 09:55.478
Uh, same, you know?

09:55.578 --> 09:57.481
Ragin', crashin'.
- Nice.

09:57.581 --> 09:59.004
[baby crying]
- Yeah, mostly raging.

09:59.104 --> 10:00.927
- What the hell?
Is that a baby?

10:01.027 --> 10:02.609
- Nope, that's two babies.

10:02.709 --> 10:04.693
We got twins. Twins.

10:04.793 --> 10:06.095
- Whoa.
- Ew.

10:06.195 --> 10:07.457
- Please stop.
- I'm gonna vom.

10:07.557 --> 10:08.539
- Yeah, I get that.
I get that.

10:08.639 --> 10:10.061
So at the end of the day,

10:10.161 --> 10:11.543
this book is about
finding common ground...

10:11.643 --> 10:13.646
- [squawk] Common ground.

10:14.528 --> 10:17.913
- Between siblings who struggle
with unique challenges.

10:18.013 --> 10:19.636
- Unique challenges.
- Yup.

10:19.736 --> 10:21.238
It's not just about
the siblings, right?

10:21.338 --> 10:22.801
It's about--

10:22.901 --> 10:24.724
- Don't--slow down, Tom.
Don't choke.

10:24.824 --> 10:26.446
- You were up at 3:00 a.m.?

10:26.546 --> 10:28.209
[chuckles]
I was up at 3:00 a.m. too.

10:28.309 --> 10:30.492
Yeah, major blowout.
- That's kinda cool.

10:30.592 --> 10:32.856
- And then 5:00 a.m. again
popping bottles with the twins.

10:32.956 --> 10:34.539
It was sick.
- So sick.

10:34.639 --> 10:35.981
- No, I'm saying
I actually think

10:36.081 --> 10:36.602
they were coming down
with something.

10:36.682 --> 10:38.305
- Gross.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.747
- Ultimately, each
of the siblings are grappling

10:39.847 --> 10:41.550
with the concept
of what's fair.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.072
Cookie? Cookie.

10:43.172 --> 10:44.835
Cookie, over here. Good.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.317
The parents also play
a pivotal role in the piece.

10:46.417 --> 10:47.959
Whoo!

10:48.059 --> 10:49.562
- Tommy, boy,
are you still with us?

10:49.662 --> 10:51.485
- I'm good. Yeah.
My tongue's a little numb.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.087
Has anyone ever died from this?

10:53.187 --> 10:55.050
- You wanna take a break?
- Nah, I'm fine.

10:55.150 --> 10:56.513
What's the next question?
- When does the book come out?

10:56.593 --> 10:57.775
- Pass. Pass.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.878
- [wheezes]
- Whoo!

11:02.722 --> 11:03.804
- Connor, these interviews
are pointless

11:03.884 --> 11:05.907
and incredibly demeaning.

11:06.007 --> 11:07.430
- I know, they've been great.

11:07.530 --> 11:10.234
But we still don't have
anything TikTok worthy.

11:10.334 --> 11:11.796
We need to give you
a blast of buzz.

11:11.896 --> 11:13.960

what a blast of buzz is

11:14.060 --> 11:15.722
or, honestly,
what else I could even do.

11:15.822 --> 11:17.165
- Well, that's why you have me.

11:17.265 --> 11:19.268
I got you an interview
with Ninja.

11:21.631 --> 11:23.054

- Tom.

11:23.154 --> 11:24.656
He's the number-one gamer
on Twitch.

11:24.756 --> 11:26.900
- Ah.
- He has 17 million followers.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.103
This is a huge get.
- No, no, no, no, no. Come on.

11:29.203 --> 11:31.066
I suck at video games.
- I know.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.149
It's like a weird
nerd blind spot for you.

11:33.249 --> 11:36.034
But don't worry,
I've hired you a consultant.

11:36.134 --> 11:39.038
- What's up, Uncle T?

11:39.138 --> 11:41.001
- Were you just waiting outside
this whole time?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.764
- Uncle Connor wanted
to make it a surprise.

11:42.864 --> 11:44.166
- I love a good reveal.

11:44.266 --> 11:45.729
Calvin's gonna help you out

11:45.829 --> 11:47.171
so you don't
completely humiliate yourself.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.493

right?

11:48.593 --> 11:49.775
- Yeah, yeah. For sure.
- Come on.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.858
- All right, you guys have fun.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.220
I got an 11:00 a.m.
with your wife.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.063
- What?
- Love you, Tom. Bye.

11:55.163 --> 11:56.185
- What time are
you gonna be back?

11:56.285 --> 12:00.592
- Okay, first of all...

12:00.692 --> 12:02.555
what is
your energy drink situation?

12:02.655 --> 12:04.237
- Oh, boy.

12:04.337 --> 12:06.361
- So I wanted to show you
my new ideas

12:06.461 --> 12:09.485
in the space,
and I put away some old things.

12:09.585 --> 12:12.650
That way,
you could really visualize it.

12:12.750 --> 12:16.496
I love these muted greens
and blues together.

12:16.596 --> 12:18.099
- Mm, wow.

12:18.199 --> 12:20.462
- And I got
this mid-century lamp.

12:20.562 --> 12:21.825
It's one of a kind,

12:21.925 --> 12:22.946
and I think
it's gonna give the room

12:23.046 --> 12:24.509
a touch of sophistication.

12:24.609 --> 12:25.791
- Sophistication.

12:25.891 --> 12:27.313
- Oh, and for the accent wall,

12:27.413 --> 12:31.039
do you prefer brushed sage
or ancient jade?

12:31.139 --> 12:32.801

12:32.901 --> 12:34.324
- What?
- Sorry.

12:34.424 --> 12:36.647

was, um...

Everything just feels wrong.

12:40.633 --> 12:43.378

12:43.478 --> 12:45.221

12:45.321 --> 12:47.023
- Yeah, maybe
this was just a mistake.

12:47.123 --> 12:49.307
I mean, Gretchen's only gone
for a few days.

12:49.407 --> 12:52.111
That's not enough time
for this much change.

12:52.211 --> 12:53.674
- Hmm.
- It's my fault.

12:53.774 --> 12:54.836
I'll still pay you
for your time.

12:54.936 --> 12:56.478
- No, please, don't.

12:56.578 --> 12:58.722
I didn't do the job.

12:58.822 --> 13:00.725
Maybe I'm not really cut out
for this, you know?

13:00.825 --> 13:01.886
- Marina, that's not true.

13:01.986 --> 13:04.090
- No, it's fine.
I get it.

- Oh.

that it's not refundable.

"Home Economics,"

There's no going back.

15:36.746 --> 15:37.767
- Look, if I had to be--
- One sec.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.810
Just gimme one second.

15:39.910 --> 15:41.373
I didn't know you were
gonna be here so early.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.897
- I think my approach just--
okay.

15:43.997 --> 15:46.000
I just---okay.
- Just give me one second.

15:47.562 --> 15:49.065
All right, I'm ready.
Let's talk buzz.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.549
- No. No more buzz.

15:51.649 --> 15:53.752
Twitch was a disaster.
Teenagers can be really cruel.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.116
They said
I look like Kerri Strug.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.718
- I see it.
- That's not the point.

15:57.818 --> 15:59.721
- Look, Tom, the point is,
it did numbers.

15:59.821 --> 16:01.484
I mean, you're all over TikTok.

16:01.584 --> 16:02.966
Why don't you just trust
that you know what I'm doing?

16:03.066 --> 16:05.530
- Oh, well,
I don't because you don't.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.533
I can't believe I agreed
to all these cheap stunts.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.097
This was a stupid plan.

16:10.197 --> 16:12.541
- You think the plan is stupid,
or you think I'm stupid?

16:12.641 --> 16:14.584
- I don't know, bro.
If the buzz blitz fits.

16:14.684 --> 16:17.449
[phone ringing]

16:18.891 --> 16:20.073
- Go for Connor.

16:20.173 --> 16:21.996
- Hi, this is Becca.

16:22.096 --> 16:24.359
I'm a producer with
"Live with Kelly and Ryan,"

16:24.459 --> 16:26.402
calling about one
of your authors, Tom Hayward.

16:26.502 --> 16:28.045
- That's a TV show.
- I know it's a TV show.

16:28.145 --> 16:29.688
Are you calling
from the TV show?

16:29.788 --> 16:31.490
- I am.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.694
We'd love Tom to come on
and talk about his book.

16:33.794 --> 16:35.216
Kelly read
the first few chapters

16:35.316 --> 16:37.019
and really took to it.

16:37.119 --> 16:38.782
- See? We just had to let
the book speak for itself.

16:38.882 --> 16:41.185
- Kelly's son
saw Tom's freakout on Twitch

16:41.285 --> 16:42.668
and told his mum
that he was "cringe

16:42.768 --> 16:44.591
in a funny way."

16:44.691 --> 16:46.834
- She only read the book
'cause I got you on Twitch.

16:46.934 --> 16:48.356
- Yeah, but come on.

16:48.456 --> 16:50.079
That means nothing
without the writing.

16:50.179 --> 16:51.642
- Well, no one's reading
the writing without the buzz.

16:51.742 --> 16:53.745
- Um, do you guys think
you're on mute?

16:54.666 --> 16:56.048
- No. No, we don't.
- No.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.771
But if I could just say,
nice to meet you.

16:57.871 --> 16:59.333
- Nice to meet you.

16:59.433 --> 17:00.816
- Hopefully we'll see you
in the future.

17:00.916 --> 17:01.977
- And why don't you shoot
over the deets,

17:02.077 --> 17:03.660
and we'll take it from there?

17:03.760 --> 17:04.782
- We'll take it from there.
- Sounds good.

17:04.882 --> 17:06.184
Talk soon--
- Perf.

17:06.284 --> 17:07.346
- I'm gonna be
on "Kelly and Ryan"!

17:07.446 --> 17:08.828
- "Kelly and Ryan."

17:08.928 --> 17:10.190
- I can't believe
your stupid plan worked.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.592
- Well,
the stupid plan only worked

17:11.692 --> 17:13.235
'cause you're stupid book's
so good.

17:13.335 --> 17:16.199
- Look, man, I appreciate
everything you've done.

17:16.299 --> 17:18.443
I guess working with family
can be complicated.

17:18.543 --> 17:20.126
- Tell me about it.

17:20.226 --> 17:21.848
I think I might have crossed
some serious boundaries

17:21.948 --> 17:24.492
with your wife.
- [chuckles]

17:24.592 --> 17:25.654
Wait, what?

17:25.754 --> 17:26.976
- I just gave it to her.

17:27.076 --> 17:28.498
I mean,
I really let her have it.

17:28.598 --> 17:30.221
- You're talking
about the redesign, right?

17:30.321 --> 17:33.506
- Oh, in my daughter's room,
of all places.

17:33.606 --> 17:35.469
I should go upstairs
and talk to her.

17:35.569 --> 17:38.153
She's probably still hurting.
- Wait, she's here right now?

17:38.253 --> 17:40.256
Connor,
what the hell is going on?

17:41.579 --> 17:42.881
[knocking]

17:42.981 --> 17:44.603
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:44.703 --> 17:46.907
Thought I would put the room
back the way it was.

17:48.669 --> 17:50.292
- Hey, um...

17:50.392 --> 17:52.175
Sorry I was so harsh
the other day.

17:52.275 --> 17:56.021
- It's fine.
You were just being honest.

17:56.121 --> 17:57.704
- For a while,
Gretchen couldn't choose

17:57.804 --> 18:00.628
between pink and purple
as her favorite.

18:00.728 --> 18:03.192
She insisted that everything
be both colors.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.295
- That's cute.

18:06.257 --> 18:08.320
- Oh, that's Carrots.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.325
Gretch wouldn't go to preschool
without Carrots.

18:11.425 --> 18:13.428
I guess she doesn't need him
anymore.

18:16.272 --> 18:19.497
- Connor,
do you think that maybe

18:19.597 --> 18:21.661
you didn't want
to change Gretchen's room

18:21.761 --> 18:25.867
because it reminds you
she's growing up?

18:25.967 --> 18:28.271
- I don't know, I just--

18:28.371 --> 18:29.953
when I saw the room
you designed,

18:30.053 --> 18:33.519
it looked like a room
for someone older.

18:33.619 --> 18:35.362
But she is older.

18:35.462 --> 18:36.804
She told me last week

18:36.904 --> 18:37.966
she doesn't even like
purple anymore.

18:38.066 --> 18:39.608
- Yeah, it goes by so fast.

18:39.708 --> 18:42.533
Camilla used to call me Mami,
and then Mum,

18:42.633 --> 18:45.097
and now it's Mother,
which feels like an attack.

18:45.197 --> 18:46.619
- Oof.

18:46.719 --> 18:48.742
At least your twins
are still little.

18:48.842 --> 18:51.907
I always imagined
having more kids.

18:52.007 --> 18:55.112
- Connor, you know,
Gretchen may be growing up,

18:55.212 --> 18:57.215
but she's still
your little girl.

18:59.459 --> 19:01.402
- You know,
now that I think about it,

19:01.502 --> 19:04.367
I'm feeling the ancient jade.
- What?

19:04.467 --> 19:07.812
- For the accent wall.
Still want the job?

19:07.912 --> 19:09.995
- I would really like that.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.381
I was just wondering
if I could--

19:13.481 --> 19:14.743
- You can keep the lamp.

19:14.843 --> 19:16.846
- Thank you.
I love it so much.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.989
- Hey, Lupe.

19:19.089 --> 19:21.834
About earlier, I just wanted
to apologize for what I said.

19:21.934 --> 19:24.237
I think I got caught up
in trying to help

19:24.337 --> 19:27.883
because
I just didn't want to...

19:27.983 --> 19:30.046
exploit you.
- Exploit me?

19:30.146 --> 19:32.089
I'm pretty sure
I make more money than you.

19:32.189 --> 19:34.453
- Well, we don't have to get
into numbers.

19:34.553 --> 19:36.216
- Yeah, I wouldn't want
to make you feel bad.

19:36.316 --> 19:38.379
Connor even set me up
with a 401k

19:38.479 --> 19:40.783
and a SEP IRA
with matching benefits.

19:40.883 --> 19:42.666
- Wow. And those
are two different things?

19:42.766 --> 19:45.310
- Look, Denise,
my job is not glamorous,

19:45.410 --> 19:48.996
but I enjoy making
Connor and Gretchen

19:49.096 --> 19:52.220
and the whole family feel
at home.

19:54.544 --> 19:56.207
- Thank you, Lupe.

19:56.307 --> 19:58.130
- So you'll stop trying
to help?

19:58.230 --> 20:00.654
- Yes. For the next few weeks,
I will literally do nothing.

20:00.754 --> 20:02.176
- Good.

20:02.276 --> 20:03.738
How about I make you
a cocktail?

20:03.838 --> 20:06.943
- Yes--and I will not help
with that.

20:07.043 --> 20:08.946
- Hang on a second.

20:09.046 --> 20:10.869
Did you say you're staying
a few weeks?

20:10.969 --> 20:12.972
- Yeah, landlord said
up to a month.

20:14.335 --> 20:16.518
- I'll make two.

20:16.618 --> 20:17.920
- Okay, Lupe, hit record.

20:18.020 --> 20:19.443
I wanna get the big reveal.

20:19.543 --> 20:21.546
You ready?

20:22.307 --> 20:23.449
- [gasps]

20:23.549 --> 20:25.732
Wow.

20:25.832 --> 20:27.455
I love it. [gasps]

20:27.555 --> 20:30.420
The bed and the painting
and the wallpaper.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.862
Oh, my gosh. I love it.

20:31.962 --> 20:33.585
Thank you so much, Aunt Marina.
- Oh.

20:33.685 --> 20:35.868
- Thank you.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.672
- Aw, you kept Carrots.

20:38.772 --> 20:41.056
- Well, you know, just trying
to keep my clients happy.

20:42.819 --> 20:44.822
I friggin' nailed this!

20:46.625 --> 20:48.528
- To your first
satisfied clients.

20:48.628 --> 20:50.891
- To your upcoming
TV appearance.

20:50.991 --> 20:52.213
[glasses clink]

20:52.313 --> 20:54.337
[romantic music]

20:54.437 --> 20:56.860
- Well, I don't think either
of us have taken any melatonin.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.184
- Not a milligram.

20:59.284 --> 21:00.867
[clatter]

21:00.967 --> 21:03.911
Oh, good ambience, honey.

21:04.011 --> 21:06.455
Did the twins help you do it?
- Shh, you're ruining this.

21:11.263 --> 21:13.166
- You're getting me so hot.

21:13.266 --> 21:14.608
[fire alarm beeping]

21:14.708 --> 21:16.491
[doorbell rings]

21:16.591 --> 21:18.173
all: Hi!

21:18.273 --> 21:19.576
[baby screaming]

21:19.676 --> 21:21.879
- Uh-oh.
They are not great houseguests.
