WEBVTT

00:06.120 --> 00:07.680
[Abby] I don't think the killer
used two knives.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.520
I think he used one knife
with two blades.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.000
[Claire] That's Jimmy Cook!

00:11.000 --> 00:13.360
- [screaming]
- Up! Put it up!

00:13.360 --> 00:14.640
Put it back up!

00:14.640 --> 00:17.840
It's not bad, Connell.
It's a code-black disaster.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.240
Just bring me a fucking suspect
or you're done!

00:20.240 --> 00:22.280
Number 27 on the list.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.560
The night Sam died,
Mike gave her a speeding ticket.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.680
MAN: Killer dyke!

00:26.680 --> 00:28.120
- [crash]
- [screams]

00:28.120 --> 00:29.880
Skye.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.400
We need to talk to you.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.000
It is possible to hate someone
and want them dead

00:34.000 --> 00:36.040
and not fucking murder them!

00:36.040 --> 00:39.240
Then why did you come back to
Deadloch the night your Dad died?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.400
No comment.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.880
Maybe you'd have
remembered the date earlier, Dulcie,

00:42.880 --> 00:45.000
if you were at home with me that weekend

00:45.000 --> 00:50.320
instead of fucking some other woman
in a work shower!

00:50.320 --> 00:53.040
It's just a job, Dulcie.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.680
Right now, my job's more important
than us, Cath.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.440
It's more important than you.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.320
Cease the Feast!

01:03.320 --> 01:05.560
...back there, Gez.
Get me back there right now.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.440
[screams]

01:07.440 --> 01:09.240
There's dead bodies!

01:16.520 --> 01:19.920
- [respirator hisses]
- [water gurgles]

01:32.520 --> 01:33.960
That's the fifth body.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.960
- Sixth.
- Ah, sixth.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.400
- Mmm.
- Even better.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.360
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:49.880 --> 01:53.600
So... how'd it go last night,
with your missus?

01:53.600 --> 01:56.600
Did you work it out?
You want to talk about it more or...?

01:56.600 --> 01:59.479
Yeah, let's go get a wine
and nut out my imploding marriage.

01:59.479 --> 02:01.760
- Really? Oh.
- No, not really.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.440
There's a serial killer targeting men.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.400
We now have male six corpses
lined out in front of us like...

02:05.400 --> 02:07.280
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
- ...Christmas stockings.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.600
So let's get that sorted first,
shall we?

02:08.600 --> 02:10.600
[Eddie] Alright,
that was my instinct, too.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.720
It's just I'm not the one who
broke up with the missus last night.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.079
Well, I don't know if we
'broke up', broke up.

02:16.079 --> 02:17.320
Look, it doesn't matter.

02:17.320 --> 02:21.160
Let's just confirm that these bodies
are in our column, shall we?

02:21.160 --> 02:23.160
- Fuck me up.
- Yeah, I hear you.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.600
Look, I know it is unpleasant...

02:25.600 --> 02:29.440
But it is our job
and he is our colleague.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.320
James!

02:33.320 --> 02:34.400
Hola!

02:34.400 --> 02:36.120
- Oh, God.
- Fucking wanker.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.880
[sniffs] Oh, fuck, Collins,
you fucking stink.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.160
[Dulcie] Yes, that is because
I was in a dead man soup last night.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.520
- You do the talking.
- Yep.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.680
- Hi.
- Gidday, Big Eyes.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.680
[James] 'Sup!

02:47.680 --> 02:49.440
Hey, babe. Take that for me?

02:54.480 --> 02:55.800
[James murmurs]

02:55.800 --> 02:57.240
Right.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.280
Any IDs on these floaters yet?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.800
Ah, negative,
because that is not my job.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.080
OK. [clears throat]

03:05.800 --> 03:07.360
OK.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.440
Right, they all have
these strangulation marks,

03:09.440 --> 03:12.400
cut out tongue, injection site,
etc, etc.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.920
Yeah, how long's
this one been dead, James?

03:13.920 --> 03:16.880
Lack of decomp suggests no more than
48 hours. The same with the rest.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.040
- What? That can't be...
- No. Six men whacked in 48 hours?

03:19.040 --> 03:21.720
- That's not possible. It's bullshit.
- No, sorry, actually, that is right.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.640
Because as I said, this body is not in
an advanced state of decomposition.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.120
And neither are the other five,
even the one that's missing an arm.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.840
I mean, his glenoid cavity is...

03:28.840 --> 03:31.480
James, I think that we would know if
six men had just vanished into thin air,

03:31.480 --> 03:33.079
so there must be another explanation.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.320
OK, well, there's not.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.840
So I'm sorry if this means a little more
work for you, but that's the job.

03:37.840 --> 03:41.520
Now I have autopsies to prepare for
and a police report to file

03:41.520 --> 03:44.880
because the forensic lock-up was
broken into when I was at TEDx Perth.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.320
- What?
- What was broken into?

03:46.320 --> 03:47.320
Yeah, that's right.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.280
The mast from the Loch Nessie
was stolen from the lock-up.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.079
James, how the hell did that happen?

03:51.079 --> 03:54.000
Well, what matters actually, Dulcie,
is what I did afterwards.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.400
I tested Jimmy Cook's crucifix
and confirmed that

03:56.400 --> 03:59.720
it actually has a waterproofing agent
on it that's used on boats.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.840
Now, here's my theory.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.840
I think the killer stole the mast

04:02.840 --> 04:05.040
and used it to make
Jimmy Cook's crucifix.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.760
Sorry, I'm so sorry, what was that?

04:06.760 --> 04:08.000
Oh, thank you so much, James.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.760
This investigation
would be nothing without you.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.720
[laughs]

04:11.720 --> 04:13.840
That is a funny joke.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.320
As if you'd ever thank me.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.120
- Ma'am, that was my theory.
- Yeah, that was your theory, Abby.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.000
We all know that that was
your theory and he just stole it.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.120
Oh! So squishy.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.920
- Stop!
- Ooh!

04:26.920 --> 04:29.440
- It's like fingering a mushroom.
- Just get your fingering out of it.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.560
- I've got gloves on.
- Hang on, hang on.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.159
Fingering a mushroom.

04:35.159 --> 04:37.800
[Eddie] Oh...
Oh, bringing back memories, is it?

04:37.800 --> 04:41.120
Abby, is there anyone from forensics
who can assist us who isn't James?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.800
Um...

04:42.800 --> 04:45.200
- It's so nice to put names to faces.
- Likewise, Kate.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.640
OK, so these bodies...

04:46.640 --> 04:50.240
Yes, so the cellular membranes
are comprehensively ruptured.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.200
The inter-cellular liquid is leaking.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.240
Cool. Cool.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.440
So, interstellar leaking,
which obviously means...

04:56.440 --> 04:57.720
- They were frozen.
- Yeah.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.000
Correct, and then they've been
steadily thawed over the last two days.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.480
Sorry, ma'ams, perhaps they were
submerged somehow.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.120
The water would have provided
a very consistent temperature

05:07.120 --> 05:08.240
to defrost them.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.600
Yeah, I think that's spot-on, Abby.

05:09.600 --> 05:15.080
OK, Kate, so, theoretically our murderer
could have killed any of these men

05:15.080 --> 05:16.760
any time in the last five years.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.520
Absolutely. And shortly after death,
they were each frozen.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.200
I assume IDs are
a matter of urgency, Detectives?

05:22.200 --> 05:24.240
- Yes, thank you Kate. Thank you.
- Great.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.560
- Constable?
- Oh, for me? No, I couldn't.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.320
- She'd love to, Kate.
- Put the gloves on, Big Eyes, go on.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.320
OK.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.480
[mouths]

05:35.440 --> 05:37.640
If the killer's been stockpiling
these bodies for years

05:37.640 --> 05:40.000
then why's she suddenly decided to
offer them up now?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.440
I don't know, but the timing
will be important.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.480
Whatever she has planned next

05:45.480 --> 05:49.120
will make this pile of dead men
look like A Muppet's Christmas Carol.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.920
We can't keep this to ourselves.
People need to be aware of the threat.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.040
Yeah.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.760
Well, we've got Skye O'Dwyer
behind bars,

[Dulcie] Last night, six bodies were
recovered from Deadloch Lake.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.520
They are in the process of
being formally identified.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.440
Now, this is a very complex development

06:40.440 --> 06:42.360
and until the police have a full picture

06:42.360 --> 06:46.720
we are encouraging the community
to operate with an abundance of caution.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.320
Are these deaths
the work of the Deadloch Ripper?

06:49.320 --> 06:51.800
Uh, well, Megan, that is a new nickname

06:51.800 --> 06:53.600
that you've come up with
and I won't be adopting,

06:53.600 --> 06:55.800
but, yes, there is compelling evidence

06:55.800 --> 06:57.760
to suggest that
the individuals in the lake

06:57.760 --> 07:00.560
are connected to both the recent
and historical murders in Deadloch.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.680
Is it true that you're holding
Skye O'Dwyer as a suspect?

07:03.680 --> 07:05.240
She remains a person of interest, yes.

We are still building a picture,

07:12.520 --> 07:14.560
and I won't be using
either of those names, OK?

07:14.560 --> 07:17.400
Does anything else connect these men?
Aside from their gender?

07:19.320 --> 07:22.040
Ah, we are... Like I said,
we're still building a picture.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.960

are police taking

07:23.960 --> 07:27.120
to stop Deadloch men from
being hunted down like human game?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.240
We are doing everything that we can
to ensure their safety

07:29.240 --> 07:31.720
but like I said, Megan,
in the short term,

07:31.720 --> 07:35.360
we are encouraging everyone to exercise
an abundance of caution...

07:35.360 --> 07:37.360
No, no, no, us men don't
need to be exercising caution.

- Us men are not the problem.

Yes, Detective, we saw six corpses
bobbing around like gnocchis in a pot

08:31.280 --> 08:32.480

08:32.480 --> 08:36.120

Of course there were no bodies
when we were setting up.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.120
I'd do it myself, but we've docked
at Macquarie Island

09:45.120 --> 09:48.960
with Princess Mary looking at
some smelly fucking seabirds.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.720
Smells like fucking hot garbage
out here.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.880
- [Hastings continues]
- [whispers] What? I can't read that.
That font size is for cobbler elves.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.520
- [whispers] Look harder!
- Sorry, Commissioner.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.280
- [Hastings continues]
- Can you just tell me?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.280
Alright, fuck it!
[regular volume] Geoffrey Haddick.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.960
...got your suspect in custody,
don't you Connell?

10:00.960 --> 10:02.360
[whispers] Geoffrey Had-dick.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.200
You've got her in custody, yeah?

10:04.200 --> 10:06.760
Ah, yes. Yes we do, sir.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.840
We... We do.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.880
Yeah, so just keep that
killer bitch O'Dwyer

10:09.880 --> 10:12.160
where she is and no more blokes
are gonna die, are they?

10:14.480 --> 10:16.240
Skye couldn't have killed
Geoff Haddick.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.240
Why not?

10:17.240 --> 10:18.640
Because Geoff Haddick died
three years ago

10:18.640 --> 10:20.960
and Skye was living in London
three years ago.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.200
So? Skye said she wasn't in Deadloch
the night of Sam's murder

10:23.200 --> 10:24.240
but she actually was.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.280
Yes, but I can verify that
Skye was in London

10:26.280 --> 10:28.360
because Cath and I visited on holiday.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.200
And when Geoff, supposedly,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.760
reversed his car off a cliff
along Settler Highway

10:32.760 --> 10:34.640
I was with Skye at Madam Tussauds

10:34.640 --> 10:37.200
staring at a wax version
of Victoria Beckham.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.480
Well, that's fucked, isn't it?

10:40.120 --> 10:41.320
Yeah.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.720
In more ways than one.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.720
[woman on radio]
You're listening to Pink Flag.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.400
I'm Marie, I'm filling in for Hamish,

10:47.400 --> 10:49.880
who's left town
on account of the serial killer.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.240
Um, yes. And, in related news,
all further Feastival events

10:53.240 --> 10:54.520
have been officially cancelled,

10:54.520 --> 10:57.160
including tonight's
Pottery and Pinot event with Gez

10:57.160 --> 10:59.000
in the Town Hall pottery studio.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.520
So you're sure
you want to stay open, Vic?

11:01.520 --> 11:04.920
Things are bad enough without
depriving people of neenish tarts, Ray.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.880
- Yeah, but with Skye in custody and...
- Ray.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.400
- Yeah. Righto.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.000
[Hunter] O'Dwyer!

11:26.320 --> 11:27.880
Where's the fucking Tammy vid at?

11:27.880 --> 11:30.360
Um, I fucking haven't taken it yet.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.880
[woman] Ronnie!

11:31.880 --> 11:34.480
Get in the car! You and Dad
are going to Launceston.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.920
See youse all later.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.360
Can we go to McDonald's on the way?

11:37.360 --> 11:40.200
Yes, just get in the car! Christ!

11:40.200 --> 11:43.240
Get the footage, 'cause we're gonna
fucking fuck that Tammy bitch up.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.200
I'll send the video
to fucking Luke Caddy

11:45.200 --> 11:46.520
and fuck up her footy career.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.120
[Callum] Fuck, Hunter, just chill out.
There's a serial killer, dude.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.240
So?

12:01.160 --> 12:04.160
Adele's Dad has taken her
and her six brothers to Strahan.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.600
This is cooked.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.360
I know, everyone's pissing off.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.080
Luke Caddy said he's not
gonna come see me

12:09.080 --> 12:10.880
until all the murdering's stopped.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.680
- It's bullshit.
- [phone chimes]

12:12.680 --> 12:16.080
Bet you wish you'd taken Margaret's
scholarship to Hobart now, eh?

12:16.080 --> 12:17.840
Yeah, nah,
I'd still take the serial killer.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.240
Dulce says the killer is targeting men.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.960
Do 17-year-olds count as men?

12:24.960 --> 12:26.280
No clue.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.200
Yeah, and 17-year-olds, like,

12:28.200 --> 12:30.280
their mums still write their names
in their clothes,

12:30.280 --> 12:33.000
but, also, Hunter
spoofed in Amber's schoolbag last term,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.280
so it's, like, a real line-ball, yeah?

12:35.280 --> 12:37.040
"I left knives at your place.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.240
"If you get attacked,
stab the thigh artery."

12:41.240 --> 12:43.640
Fucking hell, Adele!

12:43.640 --> 12:46.320
[Dulcie] OK, Abby and Kate
have identified four more men.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.320
Their families
never reported them missing.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.400
They are Gunnar Jorgensen,
Hamish Ferguson,

12:50.400 --> 12:52.480
Richard Lowan and Kieran Butcher.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.840
Any news on the missing arm?

12:53.840 --> 12:56.920
Still missing, although presumably
it belongs to Richard Lowan's body

12:56.920 --> 12:58.760
because Richard Lowan's body
doesn't have an arm.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.320
Right, OK, so these four men
went missing

13:01.320 --> 13:06.200
between early 2018 and late 2019,
according to next-of-kin.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.840
Yes, and in related news
Denise from Immigration,

13:08.840 --> 13:11.040
whose daughter
just had her first baby, FYI,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.440
she confirmed that Skye
didn't return to Australia

13:13.440 --> 13:16.240
between September of 2017
and May of 2021.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.120
So not only did Skye not know these men,

13:20.120 --> 13:22.120
we've been advised that
they had absolutely nothing to do

13:22.120 --> 13:23.160
with the football club.

13:23.160 --> 13:27.080
So aside from being male,
white and dead,

13:27.080 --> 13:29.600
we have no idea what they have in common
with the other victims.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.440
So, to summarise,

13:31.440 --> 13:33.000
we have six new victims

13:33.000 --> 13:36.760
and now we need a new suspect
and a new MO.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.000
- Can you knife me in the eye?
- Not easily, no.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.480
- Uh, so can I release Skye, then?
- Oh, I don't...

13:41.480 --> 13:44.440
It's just that Nadiyah and Cath have
been texting me very aggressively

13:44.440 --> 13:45.760
since 6am.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.480
As far as we know,
Sam O'Dwyer was still the first victim.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.360
He meant something to the killer.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.760
Skye came back that night for a reason.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.280
I think whatever happened that night
holds the key to who our killer is.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.040
So, what am I doing with Skye?

14:09.040 --> 14:11.440
Oh, just hold her
for a little bit longer.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.840
[sighs] OK, well, any help
with the messaging surrounding that

14:14.840 --> 14:16.000
would be appreciated.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.240
Just don't talk to the press, Sven, OK?

14:18.240 --> 14:19.840
[Sven] No, I meant with Cath.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Well, I... I can't help you with that.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.720
Oh, 'cause you broke up?

14:26.880 --> 14:29.160
I mean, well...

14:29.160 --> 14:32.280
Yeah, I don't know if we broke up,
specifically, or...

14:32.280 --> 14:34.680
- No?
- OK, no, no, no, let's just move on.

14:34.680 --> 14:35.840
We move on.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.720
OK, so who else
are we looking at then, hey?

14:38.720 --> 14:39.960
Who else?

14:39.960 --> 14:42.440
Madam Chutney? Old fucking... Vic?

14:42.440 --> 14:43.960
- Vic?
- No, we've been through this.

14:43.960 --> 14:47.120
Margaret was in Riomaggiore,
Vic has a dodgy hip.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.600
Sven, what is this poster?
Is that a ringworm?

14:50.600 --> 14:53.040
Oh, sorry, it's the pube
from Sam O'Dwyer's mouth.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.800
I printed it A0 size at Officeworks

14:55.800 --> 14:58.120
'cause I thought A0
meant the smallest size.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.640
But it doesn't.
It actually means the biggest size.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.360
Which is, like, crazy, 'cause it's zero.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.760
Forget about pube lady.
What about your strange wife?

15:04.760 --> 15:06.560
You mean my es-tranged wife?

15:06.560 --> 15:08.760
- Whatever. You get the gist.
- Yeah, Cath's not a night murderer.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.640
She falls asleep at 9pm
with her hand on my boob.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.200
You know, or, she did do that
until recently.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.640
It's not a thing. Let's...
It doesn't matter.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.320
[bell dings]

15:20.320 --> 15:21.640
[Sven whispers] Cath.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.040
Ooh, do you want me to...

15:23.040 --> 15:24.480
- Do you want us to turn the lights...?
- No.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.560
- Do you wanna get under the desk?
- No, I don't want you to do that, no.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.680
- I can do it.
- OK.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.240
- I'm an adult. I can do it.
- [faintly] Thank God.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.800
We'll be here if you want to debrief
or anything, Dulce, won't we?

15:32.800 --> 15:33.800
Nup.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.880
Hey, Sven, recheck the alibis
for all the women the night Sam died.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.240
One of them's sitting on a secret.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.280
I'm gonna squeeze it out of her
like an ingrown hair.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.240
Oh, God.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.640
- Cath.
- Hi.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.440
Oh, love, thanks for
bringing that in for me.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.360
No, it's for Skye.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.760
I've seen Oz.
I know how bad prison food is.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.560
That's for you. Your stuff.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.840
Right, OK. Yep, um...

15:55.840 --> 15:57.320
Yeah, some time might be good.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.640
We need to draw up
a custody agreement for the dogs.

15:59.640 --> 16:00.640
[door closes]

16:01.440 --> 16:02.680
Hi, Cath!

16:02.680 --> 16:04.840
No? OK.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.480
Is everything OK, ma'am?

16:08.480 --> 16:11.480
Yeah, yep. Everything is just perfect.
It's all perfect.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.080
- OK.
- So, what's that?

16:13.080 --> 16:17.000
Oh, we've identified the last body.
It's Daniel Tate.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.680
- Danny Tate?
- Yep.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.040
- Sexual assault Danny Tate?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.880
Sven!

16:38.160 --> 16:40.960
Hey, Tombo, you know
we can see you out here, right?

16:40.960 --> 16:43.240
What are you doing?
There's a killer on the loose, dude.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.320
Tammy, um, I need to tell you something.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.520
Fuck, I knew it.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.160
- You're in love with me, aren't you?
- Oh, shit.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.080
Explains why he started hanging out
with the footy boys.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.080
Heartbreak.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.520
- Exactly.
- No, I filmed you pulling a bong.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.280
Yeah, I know. It was fucking funny.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.480
No...

16:56.480 --> 16:59.840
Hunter told me to film you
so he could sent it to Luke Caddy

16:59.840 --> 17:02.120
so Luke Caddy wouldn't recruit you.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.200
I'm sorry.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.800
You tried to stitch me up
to get in with Hunter?

17:09.800 --> 17:11.440
Oh, that's shameful.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.440
I'm not gonna give him the video,

17:13.440 --> 17:15.560
and it probably
wouldn't have worked anyway.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.640
Nah, dude. Maybe if I was you,
it wouldn't have worked.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.240
If I was a white dude like you

17:20.240 --> 17:24.520
I could stab a swan and eat it
and I would suffer zero consequences.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.079
- Maybe gastro.
- Maybe gastro, yeah, true.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.319
But I'm a black woman.

17:28.319 --> 17:32.160
I don't get the hundreds of chances
to make mistakes that you get.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.760
Did you ever think about that?

17:33.760 --> 17:34.880
No, I didn't.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.320
Yeah, no shit. You were just
thinking about yourself.

17:37.320 --> 17:41.480
You were gonna use me to
get what you want, like I don't matter.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.200
Fuck.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.080
I'm sorry. I wanna be your mate.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.320
I don't need you! I have mates.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.080
- One mate.
- One mate. Miranda.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.640
And unlike you,
I've never had to explain to her

17:52.640 --> 17:54.320
that just because she's a white dude

17:54.320 --> 17:56.640
that doesn't mean that
she's important than me.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.000
- I'm not a white dude, though.
- I'm making a point, M. Fuck!

17:59.000 --> 18:01.320
Unlike you, Miranda's a good dude.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.720
Let's go.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.560
This is our place. Just...

18:08.560 --> 18:10.080
Yeah, this is our place. You go.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.960
I can't help you with this one, dude.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.240
Danny Tate, arrested for rape.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.280
Richard Lowans,
stalking, domestic abuse.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.960
Kieran Butcher, DV.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.880
Hamish Ferguson, sexual assault.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.400
Gunnar Jorgensen, DV and sexual assault.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.160
Geoffrey Haddick,
attempted to murder his wife.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.760
Gavin Latham, domestic abuse.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.560
Trent Latham, domestic abuse.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.080
Jimmy Cook, stalking,
indecent public masturbation.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.760
Rod Dixon,
evidence of sexual harassment...

18:42.760 --> 18:44.800
- Yeah, yeah. OK, I get it. Collins!
- ...and emotional abuse.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.800
11 men are dead.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.080
And we are looking for a pattern
in our victims, aren't we?

18:48.080 --> 18:49.200
Yes, so, what is it?

18:49.200 --> 18:52.160
They're white, they're men,
they all look like varieties of potato.

18:53.720 --> 18:54.800
Hold the fucking phone.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.640
Our killer isn't just targeting
any white man out there.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
She is targeting...

18:57.640 --> 18:58.760
- Cunts.
- ...abusers.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.800
Your term works too.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.040
Fucking hell, Collins.
You fucking cracked it!

19:02.040 --> 19:03.080
Oh.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.160
- Sorry, try it again.
- No, no.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.560
- Let me try it once more.
- I can't even look you in the eye.
No, you fucked it.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.800
But hang on, Collins.
What about Sam O'Dwyer, hey?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.160
He kicked off the cunt cull, didn't he?

19:12.160 --> 19:13.880
But dicking around on his missus

19:13.880 --> 19:16.520
hardly ranks up with
what these fucking turds got up to.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.560
OK. Ah...

19:18.560 --> 19:20.400
His... His...

19:20.400 --> 19:22.320
philandering had consequences,

19:22.320 --> 19:24.960
at least for Vic and Skye?

19:24.960 --> 19:26.640
Mmm... That's not enough.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.920
Ma'ams, this victim profile
kind of reminds me

19:28.920 --> 19:30.880
of the Angel Makers of Nagyrev.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.720
Have you heard that podcast about them?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.200
I'll link it to you. It's on eCast.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.800
- Who?
- I don't have that.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.320
Basically, in Hungary in the 1920s,

19:38.320 --> 19:40.640
one woman gave arsenic
to another woman

19:40.640 --> 19:42.320
so she could poison her abusive husband.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.520
And then it all just
kind of grew from there.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.760
Grew from there?
What do you mean, "grew from there"?

19:46.760 --> 19:49.320
Well, this woman realised that
actually heaps of women in the town

19:49.320 --> 19:51.160
were being abused by crappy men,

19:51.160 --> 19:54.920
and so she decided to
solve their problems by killing them.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.000
But then other women
got wind of the situation

19:57.000 --> 19:58.720
and they decided to kill their...

19:58.720 --> 20:00.680
Their dog-shit men too.

20:00.680 --> 20:01.680
[Abby] Yeah.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.800
They managed to keep it a secret
for about 15 years

20:03.800 --> 20:05.080
before they got caught,

20:05.080 --> 20:08.480
which checks out,
because women kill to solve a problem

20:08.480 --> 20:10.000
not to get attention.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.440
Isn't that right, ma'am?

20:11.440 --> 20:15.040
Ah, yes, yes.
Female killers don't want notoriety.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.560
They work very hard
to camouflage their actions.

20:17.560 --> 20:21.040
So, what about the lady who started
the killing in this Nodule place?

20:21.040 --> 20:23.320
How'd she know what
all these dog-shit men were doing?

20:23.320 --> 20:25.400
Was she the town flap-waxer?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.520
No, ma'am, she was the town midwife.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.280
She was the closest thing Nagyrev
had to a doctor.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.200
All the women were her patients.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.160
[Eddie] Doctor Mayor.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.160
Big Eyes, what about the women
connected to our men?

20:37.160 --> 20:38.560
The victims of the victims?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.560
Were any of them Aleyna's patients?

20:41.560 --> 20:43.480
Probably all of them, ma'am.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.720
The next closest doctor
is in Carnage Bay

20:45.720 --> 20:48.960
and he's not allowed to see
female patients without supervision.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.320
[Eddie] Mm, crook.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.320
Sven, check Doctor Mayor's alibis.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.720
Ooh, I already did that.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.160
On the night that Sam died,

20:55.160 --> 20:57.800
Aleyna said that she was working
in Glenvalleyglen.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.240
[Eddie] What's that, a whisky joint?

20:59.240 --> 21:00.720
She working part-time
at a whisky joint?

21:00.720 --> 21:03.200
- No, it's a hospital.
- Oh.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.800
Doctor Mayor was working
at the hospital. Fuck-a-duck-a-do.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.760
Well, no, actually,
I called the hospital,

21:07.760 --> 21:09.440
and, no, Aleyna wasn't working.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.800
But, actually, she was working.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.080
- What?
- But even though she wasn't working.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.160
Yeah, g'day, Ray Pies. It's me, Eddie.

21:23.160 --> 21:24.800
Yeah, just on the down-low,

21:24.800 --> 21:29.320
the killer's targeting shit men
and she's really ramping up,

21:29.320 --> 21:32.080
and there's every chance
that she'll relax her brief.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.440
And, well...

21:33.440 --> 21:38.480
You cried when your dickie
was in me last night and, uh...

21:38.480 --> 21:40.080
while that doesn't compare
to some of the shit

21:40.080 --> 21:42.400
these other blokes have been up to,
it might put a target on your back

21:42.400 --> 21:44.280
because that shit was off.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.920
It was very off. Said it at the time.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.320
Even though I knew
they were happy tears,

21:48.320 --> 21:50.080
it was still, you know...
kind of ruined the mood.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.720
So... Watch yourself and, um...

21:53.720 --> 21:56.000
I'd better get on the blower to Phil now
and give him the same warning.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.720
Not about the dickie stuff,
just, you know...

21:58.720 --> 22:01.200
Ah, yeah. Anyway, toorah.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.280
- I'm fucking Ray.
- Oh, are you, ma'am?

22:10.320 --> 22:11.320
- OK.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.920
- Yeah, I reckon I might like him, hey?

22:13.920 --> 22:15.680
Yeah, that's really nice.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.360
So how far to Glenvalleyglenross
General Hospital, then?

22:20.360 --> 22:23.680
- Um, about 10 minutes, ma'am.
- Oh, OK.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.040
Oh, look, a cow.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.880
Cath think I'm at daycare?

22:35.880 --> 22:38.600
I don't know, she's not talking to me.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.160
Least your family don't think
you're a serial killer.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.400
Imagine how bad that would be, mate.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.520
[crunch]

22:44.520 --> 22:47.360
Skye, a few days ago forensics
discovered a foreign hair sample

22:47.360 --> 22:48.680
on your father's body.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.880
- [laughs]
- Does she do this for you every day?

22:52.200 --> 22:53.880
It was a pubic hair.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.760
I heard you and Cath fight last night.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.960
Really giving your life
the nuclear treatment, aren't you, mate?

22:59.960 --> 23:01.280
The hair was in his mouth, Skye.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.440
There was also a head wound

23:02.440 --> 23:04.320
and high levels of alcohol
in his system.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.240
We think that he was
sexually intimate with someone

23:06.240 --> 23:08.040
the night he was murdered.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.920
Do you know who that person might be?

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
[bang]

23:14.560 --> 23:15.560
Skye...

23:16.560 --> 23:18.720
- If it was you...
- Oh, fuck up, Dulce!

23:18.720 --> 23:21.320
Well, then can you just tell me
what is going on?

23:21.320 --> 23:25.120
Because I have played bloody Clue
against you before, Skye,

23:25.120 --> 23:27.240
and I can tell when
you're keeping a secret.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.680
[inhales] Can't talk right now,
Detective Collins.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.640
Eating a very happy egg.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.000
Mmm.

23:40.440 --> 23:43.040
[♪ dogs bark tune of "Happy Birthday"]

23:50.880 --> 23:52.280
It's my birthday today.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.640
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.720
OK, so 10th of June 2017.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.280
Like I told your colleague,

23:59.280 --> 24:02.000
Mayor Rahme definitely wasn't
rostered on to work that night,

24:02.000 --> 24:06.120
but she did admit and personally treat
a female patient.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.920
A patient came in for infertility.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.200
Nope, sorry, had a champagne with lunch.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.560
Injuries. It says injuries.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.880
- What sort of injuries?
- I'll just check now.

24:15.880 --> 24:20.080
Ma'am, Sam O'Dwyer sustained
a head injury the night he was murdered.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.000
What if it was from a fight?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.320
With pube lady?

24:24.320 --> 24:26.320
You reckon Aleyna's patient
could be pube lady?

24:26.320 --> 24:27.320
Maybe.

24:27.320 --> 24:31.040
OK, so the patient came in with
injuries consistent with DV.

24:31.040 --> 24:34.120
Uh, she was admitted
under the name "Anna Spanner".

24:34.120 --> 24:35.960
What sort of
animated carpenter name is that?

24:35.960 --> 24:38.520
- Sounds like a fake name, doesn't it?
- Are there any photos?

24:38.520 --> 24:39.560
- There are.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.200
[Dulcie] Thanks for
putting a rush on this, Kate.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.400
[Kate] No problem.

24:43.400 --> 24:47.400
OK, so Skye O'Dwyer's DNA
is not a match for the pubic hair.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.560
Thank you, Kate. Thank you.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.400
Of the two possible outcomes
of that test,

24:51.400 --> 24:53.920
- that one is by far my favourite.
- [ding]

24:53.920 --> 24:56.120
Agreed. Oh, funny.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.160
Funny?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.480
Skye's DNA matches
one of the samples on the system.

24:59.480 --> 25:00.960
One of the victims?

25:00.960 --> 25:03.320
No, looking at the dates...

25:03.320 --> 25:06.640
this sample was taken on
the mass DNA testing day of all the men.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.920
Has no name on it.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.800
Ah, right. Well, Skye's son
was accidentally tested that day,

25:10.800 --> 25:12.240
so it's probably just him.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.720
No, it's not mitochondrial DNA.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.640
Sorry, Skye's not the mother?
So, hang on, what's the connection?

25:18.640 --> 25:21.600
Skye and the sample
share the same father.

25:23.840 --> 25:27.200
So Sam fathered another child?

25:27.200 --> 25:28.760
Yeah, looks like it.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.000
Can you tell who it is?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.080
No, samples are just numbers.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.320
Kate, do me a favour.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.200
The hair that was found
in Sam O'Dwyer's mouth,

25:37.200 --> 25:38.840
- can you run it against that sample?
- [buzzing]

25:38.840 --> 25:40.480
- Yeah, good idea.
- Thank you.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.040
Detective, I'm sorry
I'm not at the hospital...

25:42.040 --> 25:43.680
Collins.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.240
I know why Sam O'Dwyer was the first.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.520
He was a proper cunt after all.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.720
[Eddie] Photos of your injuries.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.520
Cracked pelvis,

26:00.520 --> 26:02.520
fractured wrist,

26:02.520 --> 26:04.000
broken elbow.

26:05.760 --> 26:10.360
This is a terrible, bloody assault.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.120
Did Sam do this to you?

26:19.360 --> 26:21.240
Had he been violent with you before?

26:21.240 --> 26:23.400
Sorry, is this really relevant
to your investigation?

26:23.400 --> 26:25.760
Someone knew what Sam did to Victoria,

26:25.760 --> 26:27.200
and they murdered him because of it.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.000
Yeah, and they've continued to
knock off men since then.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.640
So, yeah, Cath, it is kind of relevant.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.320
Vic, after Aleyna
admitted you to the hospital

26:35.320 --> 26:37.800
did she go back to the shack
and kill Sam?

26:40.280 --> 26:41.880
No.

26:41.880 --> 26:42.880
I did it.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.440
I killed Sam.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.920
- Vic, I advise...
- No, Cath, I've had enough.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.560
No-one else is getting caught up
in this. It's gone far enough.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.120
Vic, what happened that night?

26:57.040 --> 26:58.880
Sam and I got into a row.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.560
Um...

27:01.560 --> 27:03.600
And he started getting rough with me,

27:03.600 --> 27:06.040
and I fought back, and I killed him.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.240
Mm-hm.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.480
How?

27:10.480 --> 27:12.800
I hit him on the back of the head,

27:12.800 --> 27:15.360
with a poker from the fireplace.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.720
And then what happened?

27:18.680 --> 27:22.200
And then he stumbled back
onto the balcony...

27:22.200 --> 27:23.840
and fell into the lake.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.720
And you didn't do anything else to him?

27:27.720 --> 27:28.840
No.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.120
That's how I killed him.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.600
What was Sam wearing that night?

27:40.760 --> 27:42.640
He was in his jocks.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.240
And what was
the disagreement about, Vic?

27:51.440 --> 27:53.400
I can't remember now.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.280
- Hmm?
- Didn't take much to get him going.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.480
Was there anyone else in the shack
with you and Sam that night?

28:00.480 --> 28:02.200
- No.
- Anyone else that might have seen...

28:02.200 --> 28:04.640
- Skye wasn't there, Dulcie.
- I'm not asking about Skye, Vic.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.800
It was just me.
I killed him, with a poker and a lake.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.120
Did you plan on killing him?

28:11.120 --> 28:13.000
[Vic] No, of course not.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.400
Even in my darkest moments,
I never wanted Sam dead.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.440
I wanted him to be a better man.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.920
I wanted him to say out loud

28:21.920 --> 28:25.480
that he was sorry for what he did
to me and Skye and our family.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.120
I wanted him to...
to say sorry and mean it.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.920
Not just for us, but for Sam, too,
because...

28:33.240 --> 28:35.920
...what a waste of a life he was.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.160
So, no, I didn't want him dead.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.440
And trust me...

28:42.880 --> 28:45.120
...death doesn't bring the peace
you expect, Detective.

28:54.920 --> 28:59.160
So Sam fell in the water.
You left the shack.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.360
What happened next?

29:01.360 --> 29:04.120
I opened the door
and Vic was on my doorstep.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.920
Mm-hm.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.320
- How did she get there?
- I don't know.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.560
Her legs were all scratched up
and she was only wearing one shoe.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.400
I assume she walked.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.000
To your surgery? That's 6 Ks.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.560
Yeah, I didn't ask her to draw me a map,
I just helped.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.120
What happened after
you drove her to the hospital?

29:21.120 --> 29:22.360
I went home.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.480
Must be hard seeing a patient
getting beaten up like that.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.800
Yeah.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.120
Unfortunately, it's not rare.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.480
You know, this is domestic violence.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.880
It's not that Amazonian fish
that swims up your penis.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.040
Is there anyone who can

29:35.040 --> 29:36.800
confirm your version
of the events of that night?

29:37.880 --> 29:40.800
Yes, I was there that night, darling.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.360
Aleyna and I were
brainstorming the Feastival.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.720
But once the three of us
got Victoria inside, I left.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.400
You left?

29:48.400 --> 29:51.640
Yes, well, you know,
Vic and I were never close.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.440
Sam was Rod's friend.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.400
It was better that I didn't get involved
in Sam and Vic's private affairs.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.640
Better for who?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.520
For you?

30:00.520 --> 30:03.960
Sorry, Margaret.
Did you say "the three of us"?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.040
Yep.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.760
I was cleaning the surgery
and Vic rocked up.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.840
Sam had beaten her black and blue,
the cunt.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.120
So, then what happened?

30:13.400 --> 30:15.760
You went out and killed him as payback?

30:15.760 --> 30:19.760
Fuck, no. I got Vic inside
and helped Aleyna patch her up.

30:19.760 --> 30:22.240
Got 'em both into Aleyna's car.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.080
When they left I just went
and finished the floors and...

30:26.120 --> 30:27.400
Sharelle, you what?

30:28.440 --> 30:31.240
I went home. To bed.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.080
Can anyone colloborate that?

30:33.080 --> 30:34.840
Co... Am I saying that right?

30:34.840 --> 30:36.800
No, no, you're not.
You're not saying that right.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.080
Yeah, Gavin. Gavin can corroborate that.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.480
I was with him at the time.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.720
Want his number? I can give it to you.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.960
I don't think it's gonna answer, but.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.200
Did you see anyone else that night?

30:48.640 --> 30:51.200
Mum had rang me to tell me
she was leaving Dad.

30:51.200 --> 30:54.360
I told her to wait
for me to fly down, but...

30:54.360 --> 30:55.880
that was a decision
40 years in the making.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.240
There was no stopping her.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.520
Mum went to the Doorbell,
searching for Dad.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.960
Jimmy told her he was at the shack
with one of his girls.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.400
Mum was livid.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.760
She told Jimmy she was gonna kill him.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.600
So that's why Jimmy
was blackmailing you.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.680
You paid him to protect your mum.

31:14.680 --> 31:18.040
Well, I wasn't rewarding him
for his service to public wanking.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.760
[Eddie] So, then,
what happened that night?

31:20.760 --> 31:22.000
Soon as the plane landed,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.240
I had, like, 50 missed calls
from Aleyna and Sharelle.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.600
Once I knew Mum was safe,

31:26.600 --> 31:29.640
I fanged it to the shack
to confront that piece of shit.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.600
And that's when Mike
gave you the speeding ticket?

31:32.600 --> 31:33.840
Yep.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.800
But when I got there, Dad...

31:35.800 --> 31:37.760
was gone.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.400
First we thought
he'd gotten the shits up,

31:39.400 --> 31:41.920
but when he didn't come back
after a few days,

31:41.920 --> 31:44.760
Mum began to think
she'd killed him, accidentally.

31:44.760 --> 31:47.480
So that's why she waited to
file his missing person's report.

31:47.480 --> 31:50.640
Yeah, well, everyone assumed
he'd gone, so...

31:50.640 --> 31:52.640
we didn't correct the record.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.520
- Mm-hm.
- Do you think she killed him?

31:54.520 --> 31:55.680
I don't know.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.200
But even if she did, you saw the photos.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.160
The bruises. The busted hip.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.920
Aleyna, Margaret, Sharelle and I,

32:03.920 --> 32:07.320
we knew she didn't deserve to be
punished for defending herself

32:07.320 --> 32:10.520
so we made a pact to
keep our traps shut.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.360
What, you made a pact?

32:12.360 --> 32:14.560
Why didn't you tell me?

32:14.560 --> 32:16.400
'Cause it was a secret.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.360
[Eddie] You said there was
a girl at the shack.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.480
- Any idea who that was?
- Nuh.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.720
I've told you enough.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.680
[phone vibrates]

32:34.600 --> 32:36.400
Go ahead, Kate.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.680
You were right, Detective.

32:37.680 --> 32:41.280
The pubic hair belongs to
the mother of Sam's other child.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.480
Who's the other child?

32:42.480 --> 32:43.520
Ah, we don't know.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.760
It was an unmarked sample
from the DNA testing day.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.800
Thanks, Kate.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.680
It must have been
one of the teenagers, ma'ams.

32:48.680 --> 32:50.320
We didn't have permission
to take their samples,

32:50.320 --> 32:51.760
so none of them were labelled.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.600
Well, what boys were there?
They all look like big thumbs to me.

32:54.600 --> 32:58.120
[Abby] Um, there was
Callum, Hunter, Dolph, Tom.

32:58.120 --> 33:00.840
Callum's little brother, Jasper.

33:00.840 --> 33:04.200
Although, Sam would have been really
dead by the time Jasper was...

33:04.200 --> 33:07.720
[Abby and Sven continue indistinctly]

33:23.120 --> 33:26.120
Holy shit gods.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.400
He's the dead fucking spit.

33:31.520 --> 33:33.400
Loch Nessie.

33:43.880 --> 33:47.080
Vanessa, do you recognise this boat?

33:48.520 --> 33:50.840
Mm-hm, that's Sam's boat.

33:50.840 --> 33:53.480
- Mm-hm. What's its name?
- The Loch Nessie.

33:53.480 --> 33:55.000
The Nessie.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.240
That's the nickname that
Phil called you yesterday

33:57.240 --> 33:58.760
when he was talking to the press.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.640
Did Sam O'Dwyer name his boat after you?

34:01.640 --> 34:05.000
I don't know, maybe.
It was 20 years ago. I can't remember.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.360
- 20 years ago?
- Mm-hm.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.400
20, 24 years.
Something like that.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.280
Vanessa, you were 15 then.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.120
Was that when you started seeing Sam?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.560
That's statutory rape.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.679
Like, you wouldn't understand this,

34:17.679 --> 34:19.400
because you're a lesbian...

34:20.480 --> 34:22.960
...and you're not anything.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.400
Sam was a red-blooded man
in an unhappy marriage.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.159
He said we had a connection
that wasn't about our ages.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.960
He said I was the only person
who really got him.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.520
Vanessa, he groomed you.

34:33.520 --> 34:34.920
My hair?

34:34.920 --> 34:37.440
Mate, he was in his 40s.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.920
You were Year 10.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.199
You should have been in home ec class,
fucking up an omelette.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.400
I was in Year 9, actually,

34:42.400 --> 34:44.800
and everyone said
I was really mature for my age.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.199
- Who's everyone?
- Sam. Rod Dixon.

34:47.199 --> 34:51.040
Look, I already told you this.
Men have always been obsessed with me.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.040
This is why I can't have female friends.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.840
Women can't hack
the attention I get from men.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.639
You're both just jealous of me.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.320
Vanessa, we know that Dolph
is Sam O'Dwyer's son.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.560
Were you still seeing Sam
when he disappeared?

35:11.160 --> 35:13.360
Not often.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.280
Every time I tried to end it completely,

35:15.280 --> 35:16.640
Sam would threaten to tell Trent,

35:16.640 --> 35:20.480
and I was scared about
Trent would react.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.840
He had a bit of a temper.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.200
Were you with Sam
the night he disappeared?

35:27.440 --> 35:30.800
Vanessa, Sam O'Dwyer
sexually assaulted you as a minor.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.000
He blackmailed you into a relationship.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.400
By the sounds of it,
Rod Dixon knew about all that

35:35.400 --> 35:37.040
and did nothing to help you.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.640
Trent abused you, Gavin and Jimmy
sexually harassed you...

35:39.640 --> 35:42.840
Oh, my God, you're blowing this all
way out of proportion.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.600
It was fine.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.040
It's just... men being men, you know?

35:49.080 --> 35:51.520
Yeah. We do know.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.040
It's just far from fucking fine, mate.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.440
Vanessa, your pubic hair
was found in Sam O'Dwyer's mouth

35:55.440 --> 35:56.640
the night he disappeared,

35:56.640 --> 35:58.480
the night that we believe
he was murdered.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.440
- So?
- So it places you at the crime scene.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.920
You think I killed Sam?

36:06.640 --> 36:08.120
No...

36:08.120 --> 36:09.800
I was there that night, sure,

36:09.800 --> 36:11.640
but I went out a window
as soon as Vic showed up.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.920
Ask Sharelle. She picked me up.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.560
I swear, I didn't kill him!

36:16.560 --> 36:18.480
I'm in the business
of keeping people alive,

36:18.480 --> 36:20.360
no matter who they are.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.640
I didn't kill him.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.760
No, I had absolutely
no reason to, darling.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.000
I didn't kill him.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.160
We've been through this.
I didn't kill him.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.320
He was fucking monster.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.520
But I didn't kill him.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.160
Yes. That's how I killed him.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.200
- Vic didn't kill him.
- Hard agree.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.880
If Sam O'Dwyer's head wound
was the cause of death,

36:42.880 --> 36:44.160
then, sure, charge Vic.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.800
Charge them all as accessories,
but that's not what fucking happened.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.040
None of them knew anything
about the strangling,

36:49.040 --> 36:50.160
the tongues,

36:50.160 --> 36:52.400
what Sam was wearing.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.360
Someone else knew
what Sam was doing to Vic.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.320
The police divers
have found the arm in the lake.

36:56.320 --> 36:59.160
[Eddie] Great, but we don't have time to
reunite long-lost body parts right now.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.680
- We can head out there, ma'ams.
- Yes, we can go.

37:01.680 --> 37:04.320
- Charge the women, or release them.
- Cath...

37:04.320 --> 37:06.840
That holding cell has
a maximum capacity of three people.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.960
They'll be up
under each other's armpits.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.640
Either charge them, release them,
or I'll be applying for a court order,

37:12.640 --> 37:14.280
Detective.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.760
But I confessed. I don't understand.

37:22.760 --> 37:26.040
You've been through a lot tonight, Vic.
You need to come with me.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.920
You told them about
me and your Dad, didn't you?

37:27.920 --> 37:30.560
No. Unlike you, I don't out people.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.920
[Cath] Ladies, we need to debrief
about this. Where can we go?

37:32.920 --> 37:35.160
[Aleyna] Well, Gez gave me the keys
to the pottery studio.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.560
- Skye...
- Na, I can't.

37:36.560 --> 37:38.160
- [Nadiyah] Skye!
- [men chant indistinctly]

37:38.160 --> 37:39.840
- [McGangus] When do we want it?
- [men] Tonight!

37:39.840 --> 37:41.360
- What do we want?
- Reclaim the night!

37:41.360 --> 37:42.960
- When do we want it?
- Tonight!

37:42.960 --> 37:44.800
What are those dick nuggets doing?

37:44.800 --> 37:46.160
- When do we want it?
- Tonight!

37:46.160 --> 37:48.160
- I said, what do we want?
- Reclaim the night!

37:48.160 --> 37:49.680
- When do we want it?
- Tonight!

37:49.680 --> 37:51.520
- What do we want?
- Reclaim the night!

37:51.520 --> 37:52.680
- When do we want it?
- Tonight!

37:52.680 --> 37:53.920
What's going on, Phil?

37:53.920 --> 37:56.640
We heard you she-cops
were letting O'Dwyer go.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.440
So if you're not gonna protect us,

37:58.440 --> 38:00.520
then we're gonna take matters
into our own hands.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.840
[Eddie laugh] Oh, yeah?

38:01.840 --> 38:05.160
And how exactly do you plan on
defending yourself, Phil, eh?

38:05.160 --> 38:08.360
We'll be using any means necessary,
sweetheart.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.960
And we're gonna make sure
that man-killer O'Dwyer

38:10.960 --> 38:12.640
doesn't try anything else, OK?

38:12.640 --> 38:17.000
No, no, Phil, you are not.
I order everyone to drop their...

38:17.000 --> 38:19.320
their gardening trowels...

38:19.320 --> 38:21.320
- and go home.
- No.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.560
No, no, no, we're gonna
reclaim the night.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.160
We're not gonna sit in silence.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.840
We're not gonna live with fear.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa

38:30.600 --> 38:32.200
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

38:46.880 --> 38:49.480
Hey! Hey get off the fucking road!

38:49.480 --> 38:53.040
- Get off the road!
- Move! Move, move, move, move!

38:55.040 --> 38:56.400
[indistinct shouting]

38:56.400 --> 38:58.600
[Dulcie] Get up!
[McGangus shouts indistinctly]

38:59.600 --> 39:01.760
- [McGangus] What the fuck?!
- [Eddie] That was the Pro-Bro ute.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.000
- [Dulcie] Did you see their face?
- No. Let's go. Come on.

the Carnage Bay cops.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.160
[Eddie] Yeah, give me
that fucking radio.

39:15.160 --> 39:17.080
Attention, all units.
Every fucker in Tasmania.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.920
We are in pursuit of a green ute.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.760
A real aggressive, lolly-frog green ute
heading out of town.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.160
We require back up.
I repeat, we need back up.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.600
Drive faster, Collins, drive!

39:25.600 --> 39:28.800
There's pademelons everywhere
and I am trying not to hit them!

39:28.800 --> 39:30.160
[Eddie] Get up the dirt road!

39:30.160 --> 39:32.080
[Dulcie] Yes, I am.
That is exactly what I'm doing!

39:32.080 --> 39:33.680
[Eddie] Where'd she fucking go?
Can you see?

39:33.680 --> 39:36.160
[Dulcie] I can't see anything
because you are talking too loud!

39:36.160 --> 39:38.160
[Eddie] Oh, there's no fucking sense!

39:38.160 --> 39:40.160
There it is. There it is, Collins.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.640
This is Redcliffe. We've located
the vehicle on Chapel's Lane.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.160
We request urgent back up.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.840
Agh...

39:59.840 --> 40:01.120

a tree root, did you say?

40:17.800 --> 40:20.760
- Yeah, it was.
- Wow, that's crazy, you know?

40:20.760 --> 40:22.320
What's the visibility like down there?

40:22.320 --> 40:23.800
I used to dive, that's all.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.560
Um, I'm actually thinking of
getting back into it.

- [whispers] I'm in love with him.
- OK.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.800
He found, like, a car in there.
A full car.

perfect condition, apparently.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.800
Phil called an emergency
men's-only town hall meeting,

41:12.800 --> 41:14.880
where they voted him in
as caretaker mayor

41:14.880 --> 41:16.200

a cop over there?
- [Aleyna] Where is the lie there, Gez?

41:18.760 --> 41:20.680
Oi, oi, oi, oi, guys, guys.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.000
Why is there a fucking bus?

41:22.000 --> 41:25.600
Someone at the meeting suggested
bussing all of the men out of town.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.880
[Aleyna] They're taking every remaining
Deadloch man over the age of 17

41:28.880 --> 41:31.200
to some secure, undisclosed location

41:31.200 --> 41:33.400

41:33.400 --> 41:35.280
is apprehended or gunned down.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.800
Are you getting on the bus, Tom?

41:36.800 --> 41:38.440
I kinda don't wanna die, Dulcie.

41:38.440 --> 41:42.280
Yeah, yeah. And Vic and I think
that's a really good instinct, Dulce.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.840
[Gez] Oh, I can stay, sweetpea.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.760
[Aleyna] No, I won't cope if
something happens to you, Gez.

41:46.760 --> 41:49.160
For one thing, I don't know
the passwords to anything,

41:49.160 --> 41:50.640
but more than that,

41:50.640 --> 41:52.520

- Commissioner Hastings.

You've set all the killers free.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.560
Skye O'Dwyer wasn't in the country.

I mean the whole bloody lot of them.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.680

little fucking murder board

44:02.680 --> 44:05.320

in 10 minutes flat, ladies.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.880
It's been staring you in the face
this whole time.

44:07.880 --> 44:10.760
- This town is full of
man-hating lesbians...
- [phone buzzes]

44:10.760 --> 44:12.520
...with a taste for man murder.

44:12.520 --> 44:15.040
Sir, we don't believe that
the women are involved, sir.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.640
These Carnage Bay boys told me
that they were all in here

44:17.640 --> 44:19.560
and that you even got a confession
out of one of them.

44:19.560 --> 44:20.880
And what do you girls do?

44:20.880 --> 44:22.640
You let them go and one of them
tries to run the men over

44:22.640 --> 44:24.280
like they're skittles
in a fucking bowling alley.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.960
- Sir, if you could please
just listen...
- Nuh!

44:25.960 --> 44:27.800
Effective immediately, I'm taking over.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.480
You and your little pocket mate here
are no longer calling the shots.

44:30.480 --> 44:33.160
- What'd you call me?
You can't do that!
- The women don't add up, sir!

44:33.160 --> 44:35.160
You know what doesn't add up, Collins?

44:35.160 --> 44:37.520
Your wife is the local vet.

44:37.520 --> 44:41.000
She has access to Pentobarbital.
Had she been investigated?

44:41.000 --> 44:43.200
No! She's representing the women!

44:43.200 --> 44:46.240
And then we've got
this lady Mayor Rahme, doctor, swimmer.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.640
Why isn't she behind bars?

44:47.640 --> 44:49.520
'Cause they've all got
fucking alibis, mate!

44:49.520 --> 44:51.720
So if one can't do it,
another one will step in.

44:51.720 --> 44:53.080
- No...
- They're sharing the load?

44:53.080 --> 44:56.240
We are not talking about a group of
women in a school carpool here, sir.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.920
Then who do you think is doing it, then?

44:57.920 --> 45:00.320

- At present we don't have a...

We don't have enough evidence
to arrest them, sir.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.400
I know you don't.
That's why you're not running the case.

and raiding those women's houses.

out of the lake.

46:14.240 --> 46:18.560
I think that the killer submerged
the bodies inside the car two days ago.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.280

and released the bodies

46:21.280 --> 46:23.120
