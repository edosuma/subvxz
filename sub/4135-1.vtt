08:42.623 --> 08:44.063

WITH THAT YOURSELF?

08:44.057 --> 08:46.657

GOT THE DATE WRONG.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.552
MAYBE HE THOUGHT
THE PARTY WAS TOMORROW.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.507
AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET IT
GO

13:02.516 --> 13:04.876

13:06.920 --> 13:08.490
WHICH, FOR THE RECORD,
I AM NOT--

13:08.488 --> 13:10.488

-FIRST OF ALL--

13:11.992 --> 13:13.292
...HE'S A LAWYER,

13:13.293 --> 13:15.093

THAT HE IS ALL LEFT-BRAIN--

13:15.095 --> 13:17.955

13:17.964 --> 13:19.904

BECAUSE YOU'RE ILLOGICAL!

13:25.105 --> 13:26.365
NO.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.273
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
IT'S THE ONLY SHOE

13:28.275 --> 13:30.175
THAT WORKS FOR THE OUTFIT.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.437
AND SECOND OF ALL,
I'M NOT HIS TYPE.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.275
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.081
I-I DON'T KNOW,
I CAN JUST TELL.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.122
HE PROBABLY DATES WOMEN
WHO ARE THOROUGHBREDS,

13:38.118 --> 13:41.118
WHERE I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
AM A MIXED-BREED RESCUE.

LATE.

GO TO THE TIBETAN PLACE.

WHAT'S "HUH"?

15:54.921 --> 15:56.391
I DON'T KNOW...

15:56.389 --> 15:57.489
YOU JUST DIDN'T
STRIKE ME

15:57.490 --> 15:58.790
AS A "VINTAGE"
KIND OF GUY.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.432
HA, WELL,
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,

16:00.427 --> 16:01.787
BUT IT'S NOT VINTAGE,
IT'S CLASSIC.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.455
WHICH IS ANOTHER WORD
FOR VINTAGE.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.733
NOT EXACTLY.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.761
WHEN I THINK "VINTAGE,"
I THINK OLD AND DUSTY,

16:06.766 --> 16:08.396
PAST ITS PRIME--

16:08.401 --> 16:09.901
YOU KNOW,
THAT KIND OF THING.

16:09.903 --> 16:10.973

TO LOVE VINTAGE.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.901
IT'S KIND OF
MY WHOLE THING.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.866
OH. CAN WE
CHANGE THE TOPIC

16:14.874 --> 16:15.914
SO I DON'T PUT MY FOOT

16:15.909 --> 16:17.409
EVEN FARTHER
INTO MY MOUTH?

16:17.410 --> 16:18.440
YES. YES.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.679
THAT YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO TOUCH

16:20.680 --> 16:22.310
THE TOP OF
A TIBETAN PERSON'S HEAD?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.975
THAT IT'S CONSIDERED
A SACRED PART OF THEIR BODY?

16:24.985 --> 16:26.345
IS THAT EVEN MORE
ELEVATOR TRIVIA?

16:26.353 --> 16:28.523
NO. I SAW IT
IN A DOCUMENTARY.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.591
I WATCH A LOT OF THEM.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.689
NOT THAT I, LIKE,

16:30.690 --> 16:32.420
STAY HOME EVERY NIGHT
WATCHING THEM.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.655
I TOTALLY HAVE
A SOCIAL LIFE.

I REALLY ENJOY THEM.

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:20.542
THEY LIED.

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:22.313
NO, RAIN ON
YOUR WEDDING DAY

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:23.611
IS GOOD LUCK.

01:21:23.613 --> 01:21:24.913
-WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?
-FROM YOU.

01:21:24.914 --> 01:21:25.984
AT LEAST YOU HAVE

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:27.622
THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY
FOR YOUR RECEPTION.

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:29.317
IT'S A REALLY
BEAUTIFUL BUILDING.

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:30.518
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS.

01:21:30.519 --> 01:21:32.249
I MEAN,
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

01:21:32.255 --> 01:21:33.485
SAYING MY VOWS

01:21:33.489 --> 01:21:34.819
ON THE PUTTING GREEN
AT THE GOLF COURSE,

01:21:34.824 --> 01:21:36.594
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
WE HAD OUR FIRST KISS,

01:21:36.592 --> 01:21:37.892
BUT, YOU KNOW,

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.594
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE THE CEREMONY IS--

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:41.255
I JUST WANT TO MARRY SAM.

01:21:41.264 --> 01:21:42.564
AND CLAIRE THOUGHT AHEAD
AND INSISTED

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:44.265
THEY SET UP THE TABLES
AND CHAIRS

01:21:44.267 --> 01:21:46.627
AT THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY,
IN CASE WE HAD AN EMERGENCY.

01:21:46.636 --> 01:21:47.736
AND THEY DID...

01:21:47.737 --> 01:21:49.197
BUT THERE'S A SLIGHT
PROBLEM.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:51.105
HOW SLIGHT?

01:21:51.107 --> 01:21:53.467
ABOUT A FOOT'S WORTH OF
WATER.

01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:55.236
THERE WAS A FLOOD.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:57.384
WITH ALL THIS RAIN,
THE CEILING CAVED IN.

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:00.880
SO UNLESS WE WANT TO HAND
OUT
RUBBER RAIN BOOTS AT THE
DOOR,

01:22:00.883 --> 01:22:02.383
THAT ISN'T GOING TO WORK
EITHER.

01:22:02.385 --> 01:22:04.845
IT WAS ALL
GOING SO WELL,

01:22:04.854 --> 01:22:06.354
AND NOW EVERYTHING'S
FALLING APART.

01:22:06.355 --> 01:22:08.515
OH, NO, DARLING,
IT ISN'T.

01:22:08.524 --> 01:22:09.564
DON'T WORRY.

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:10.958
[THUNDER CRASHING]

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.490
WE'LL MOVE THE RECEPTION
TO MY HOUSE.

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:15.526
WHAT ABOUT THE CEREMONY?

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:19.201
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA
FOR THAT.

01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:21.641
[♪♪♪]

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.938

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.813
YOU TWO
ARE IN A HURRY.

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:35.646
...SAM TAYLOR

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:36.981
