Wait a minute! Now, just where
do you think you're going?

01:00.633 --> 01:03.433
Over to Mildred's to watch
the adult movie channel.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.867
She has a wide-screen TV.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.600
You are not going anywhere.
Dr. Clayton is coming.

01:09.667 --> 01:13.266
-Dr. Silvano is my doctor!
-Dr. Silvano is dead.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.934
Trust me, I'm in better shape
than he is. Goodbye.

01:16.433 --> 01:18.867
Ma, you have to have
an examination!

01:18.934 --> 01:20.467
Now, your blood
pressure is up,

01:20.533 --> 01:22.567
you're tired,
you have absolutely no color.

01:22.633 --> 01:25.233
I'm an old white woman.
I'm not supposed to have color.

01:26.233 --> 01:28.333
You want color?
Talk to Lena Horne.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.100
Here we are, Sophia.
Homemade chicken soup.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.700
I used to make it for my husband
when he wasn't feeling well.

01:35.767 --> 01:38.567
Did you make it for him the last
time he wasn't feeling well?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.266
-Oh, hello, everyone.
-(Dorothy) Hi, Blanche.

01:41.333 --> 01:44.266
Oh, I just happened upon
the most divine dress sale.

01:44.333 --> 01:47.200
I would've called you girls,
but all they had left were petites.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.400
So what did you buy, shoes?

01:54.300 --> 01:55.967
I'm a petite.
I'd better get over there.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.467
I need a black dress for
Dr. Silvano's funeral.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.533
Dr. Silvano died
two months ago.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.433
You went to his funeral.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.834
Right, I can't let him
see me in the same dress.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.066
Ma, you're not going anywhere
until the doctor comes!

02:11.133 --> 02:12.900
Sophia, you can't
go anywhere now.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.400
I want you to see how good
I look in my new dress!

02:16.300 --> 02:17.867
You know something?
We are really lucky

02:17.934 --> 02:20.200
that we found a doctor
who makes house calls.

02:20.266 --> 02:23.433
I know. When I was
growing up in Minnesota,

02:23.500 --> 02:27.433
the doctor made house calls all
the time, for us and the livestock.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.734
You and the animals
had the same doctor?

02:31.800 --> 02:33.633
Sure. Worked out fine...

02:34.367 --> 02:36.967
until the doctor started
drinking hog liniment

02:37.033 --> 02:39.166
and tried to neuter
the Swensen brothers.

02:40.266 --> 02:41.767
(doorbell rings)

02:42.834 --> 02:46.033
If that's the doctor, tell him
I have no insurance and no money!

02:46.100 --> 02:48.967
If he still wants to come in,
he just wants to see me naked.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.467
Hello, I'm Dr. Clayton.
I'm here to see Sophia Petrillo.

02:55.533 --> 02:57.900
Oh, please, please, come right in.

02:57.967 --> 02:59.767
I'm Dorothy,
Sophia's daughter,

02:59.834 --> 03:01.834
and I usually look much better.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.600
This is my friend, Rose.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.133
-Hello, doctor.
-Rose.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.767
And this is Sophia.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.100
What seems to be her problem?

03:10.166 --> 03:11.900
Well, her blood pressure is up

03:11.967 --> 03:13.900
and she's a little pale
and a little tired.

03:13.967 --> 03:15.200
She presently on any medication?

03:15.266 --> 03:16.767
Yes, to control her blood pressure.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.133
How long's she been
on that medication?

03:18.200 --> 03:20.633
What am I, two years old?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.233
I don't know my own symptoms?

03:22.300 --> 03:24.600
I've lived in this
body since I was born.

03:24.667 --> 03:27.333
If something goes wrong,
I'm the first one to hear about it!

03:28.266 --> 03:31.266
I'm sorry, Sophia.
What seems to be the problem?

03:31.333 --> 03:32.734
What am I, a doctor?

03:34.333 --> 03:36.867
Why don't we start by taking
your temperature, huh?

03:36.934 --> 03:38.233
Temperature, hmm.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.967
He must have graduated
at the top of his class.

03:41.567 --> 03:42.767
Under your tongue.

03:43.266 --> 03:47.166
Tell me, are you new
to this area, Dr. Clayton?

03:47.233 --> 03:51.000
-Yes. I recently moved here.
-Oh, Miami's a beautiful city.

03:51.066 --> 03:52.800
I'm sure you'll enjoy living here.

03:52.867 --> 03:57.533
Yes, and I'm sure your wife,
Mrs. Clayton, will enjoy it too.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.700
Mrs. Clayton
and I are no longer together.

03:59.767 --> 04:01.133
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:04.467 --> 04:07.967
So, tell me, have you had a chance
to see much of the city?

04:08.033 --> 04:09.400
No, not really.

04:09.467 --> 04:12.867
Well, perhaps I could show you
some of the highlights sometime.

04:12.934 --> 04:15.233
That sounds great.
I'd love it!

04:15.300 --> 04:16.967
I'd love to go too.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.500
Except, I have
to wash my hair...

04:22.000 --> 04:23.433
every day...

04:24.934 --> 04:26.400
for the rest of my life.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.300
It's very oily.

04:30.567 --> 04:32.834
What about dinner tomorrow night,
Dorothy?

04:32.900 --> 04:34.633
-Say, about eight?
-Perfect!

04:34.700 --> 04:37.133
We'll go to Jack's crab house.
It's wonderful.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.133
Well, girls, is this dress
gonna stop traffic or what?

04:41.667 --> 04:44.266
Oh... hello there.

04:45.467 --> 04:47.633
I don't believe we've
been introduced.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.667
My name is Blanche Deveraux.

04:49.734 --> 04:51.233
That's French for...

04:52.166 --> 04:53.333
"Blanche Deveraux."

04:56.233 --> 04:57.433
I'm pleased to meet you.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.266
Forgive me for staring,
but I do declare,

05:00.333 --> 05:02.600
you're just about the most
attractive man I've seen in Florida

05:02.667 --> 05:04.767
since Mr. John Forsythe
performed <i>Hamlet</i>

05:04.834 --> 05:06.467
at the Burt Reynolds dinner theater.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.100
Blanche,
might I see you a moment?

05:10.166 --> 05:12.266
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>
Oh!

05:12.333 --> 05:14.867
Listen, you keep your
bloomers on, Scarlett.

05:14.934 --> 05:17.133
He's taking me out
tomorrow night.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.767
But he wants me.
I can feel it.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.900
Let somebody else feel it.

05:24.567 --> 05:28.000
-I saw him first.
-But we were meant for each other.

05:28.066 --> 05:31.200
-I'm a woman, he's a man.
-And what am I, little Richard?

05:34.266 --> 05:36.200
Oh, all right, fair's fair.

05:36.266 --> 05:38.800
But if he has a friend
who makes house calls,

05:38.867 --> 05:42.266
I can be ill any night
this week except Thursday.

05:43.133 --> 05:44.867
Well, doctor, how is she?

05:44.934 --> 05:46.800
Her temperature
seems to be normal.

05:46.867 --> 05:50.233
Tell me, Sophia, are you taking
your medication as directed?

05:50.300 --> 05:53.433
I take my medication
every day, if I remember.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.600
You have to remember
to take it every day.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.734
Oh, I'll see that she does,
Dr. Clayton.

05:58.834 --> 05:59.967
Elliot.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.767
Well, ladies, it's been
a great pleasure meeting you.

06:02.834 --> 06:03.834
Dorothy...

06:04.500 --> 06:06.567
it's been especially
nice meeting you.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.800
I'm sure she's all right,

06:08.867 --> 06:11.200
but you call me if you need me,
and I'll see you tomorrow night.

06:12.433 --> 06:15.600
-Goodbye, Elliot.
-Goodbye, Dorothy.

06:18.500 --> 06:22.100
Oh, thank you for being
a kind and generous God.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.967
Ok, what do you
think of this one?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.800
Oh, Dorothy.

06:32.867 --> 06:35.166
You and Elliot have been out
almost every night this week.

06:35.233 --> 06:37.133
He's obviously hooked.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.767
You don't have to look good anymore.
What you have on is fine.

06:45.734 --> 06:47.834
I'll change.
Oh, come on.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.033
I'll help you pick out something.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.033
There's nothing left to pick!

06:50.100 --> 06:52.433
The only thing I haven't
tried on is the bedspread.

06:53.633 --> 06:54.600
(doorbell rings)

07:00.166 --> 07:03.633
-Oh, hello, Elliot. Come in.
-Hello, Blanche. Dorothy ready?

07:03.700 --> 07:05.600
Oh, I'm afraid
she's gonna be a little while.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.233
May I offer you a drink?

07:07.300 --> 07:09.166
Why, sure, if you'll join me.

07:09.233 --> 07:12.266
I don't mind if I do.
What would you like?

07:12.333 --> 07:15.500
Something smooth and sweet
with a little kick to it.

07:15.567 --> 07:18.000
Hmm.
How about a sloe gin fizz?

07:18.066 --> 07:19.233
Now, you're talking
about the drink

07:19.300 --> 07:21.667
and I'm talking
about the bartender.

07:23.533 --> 07:25.433
-Oh.
-Blanche, you feel all right?

07:25.500 --> 07:27.200
-You feel a little flushed to me.
-I do?

07:27.266 --> 07:28.967
Yeah, let me check your pulse.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.000
Ooh, it's racing.
You know what?

07:32.700 --> 07:35.166
-So is mine.
-I beg your pardon?

07:36.100 --> 07:38.867
You are a very
attractive woman, Blanche.

07:38.934 --> 07:40.633
-I know.
-Very...

07:43.333 --> 07:44.967
very attractive.
Now, wait a minute.

07:45.033 --> 07:46.266
What are you doing?
How dare you?

07:46.333 --> 07:47.934
What kind of a woman
do you think I am?

07:48.033 --> 07:48.834
Come on. Relax.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.700
Relax?
Don't you tell me to relax!

07:54.266 --> 07:56.834
I am not accustomed
to being manhandled.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.400
-I thought you'd be flattered.
-Well, I'm not.

07:59.467 --> 08:02.967
Pardon my strong language,
but you, sir, are no gentleman.

08:04.433 --> 08:05.400
I'm sorry.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.066
You ought to be.
What about Dorothy?

08:07.133 --> 08:08.400
She happens to be my friend.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.300
There's no reason to bring
Dorothy into this.

08:10.367 --> 08:12.033
-Hmm.
-Hi, Elliot.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.567
Hello, Rose.

08:14.734 --> 08:17.400
My, what is that marvelous
scent you're wearing?

08:17.900 --> 08:19.633
Fancy albacore tuna.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.533
I made a casserole for dinner.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.300
Well, you certainly wear it well.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.066
I think it's the pimento
that really sets it off.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.600
Hello, Elliot.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.367
It's all right,
but we should be going.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.000
Girls, if I'm not
back by Christmas,

08:37.066 --> 08:39.800
someone take my mother
to midnight mass.

08:42.967 --> 08:46.467
There is something about
that man I don't trust.

08:46.533 --> 08:48.367
I can't put my finger on it.

08:48.433 --> 08:50.500
I can. He's a letch.

08:52.467 --> 08:53.867
No, that isn't it.

08:56.233 --> 08:58.900
Oh, yes it is, Rose.
He made a pass at me.

09:00.433 --> 09:04.000
Oh, my Lord!
That's terrible!

09:04.066 --> 09:05.867
Dorothy'll be heartbroken
when you tell her.

09:05.934 --> 09:08.800
-Oh, I'm not telling her anything.
-Well, she's your friend.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.000
-You've got to tell her!
-Oh, no, I don't.

09:11.066 --> 09:13.300
The last time a friend's sweetheart
made a pass at me,

09:13.367 --> 09:15.100
I lost my friend and her beau.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.300
And her beau?

09:16.367 --> 09:18.000
That's right.
Anderbeau Johnson.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.633
Clyde Whitehead,
Anderbeau's Beau,

09:21.700 --> 09:23.633
decided he wanted to see
my cheerleader's sweater

09:23.700 --> 09:25.500
from the inside.

09:25.567 --> 09:28.400
So when I told Anderbeau,
she blamed the whole thing on me,

09:28.467 --> 09:31.066
and then Clyde would never
speak to me again for telling!

09:31.133 --> 09:33.000
I lost Anderbeau and her beau!

09:34.533 --> 09:36.400
Now you understand
why I can't tell Dorothy?

09:36.467 --> 09:39.633
I don't even understand
who Anderbobo is.

09:42.367 --> 09:45.367
All I know is that
Dorothy should find out

09:45.433 --> 09:48.033
what kind of a man
Elliot really is.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.066
Now, if you're her friend,
you'll tell her.

09:50.133 --> 09:51.767
But, honey, she'd be devastated!

09:51.834 --> 09:53.734
What kind of a friend
would I be to hurt her like that?

09:53.800 --> 09:57.033
What kind of a friend would you be
if you let Elliot ruin her life?

09:57.100 --> 09:59.133
She could marry that man!

09:59.200 --> 10:00.867
They could have a child!

10:03.100 --> 10:04.867
They could adopt a child!

10:06.533 --> 10:09.100
And then one night
at the country club,

10:09.166 --> 10:12.567
possibly during little
Mei-Ling's coming-out party...

10:16.734 --> 10:18.700
Dorothy's having
the time of her life

10:18.767 --> 10:20.467
when she goes to the powder room

10:20.533 --> 10:23.834
and she overhears the towel lady
telling Mrs. Steinbeck

10:23.900 --> 10:27.066
that Dorothy's husband,
Dr. Elliot Clayton,

10:27.133 --> 10:30.266
has bonged every female
member of the country club.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.300
Can you let that happen to Dorothy?

10:33.367 --> 10:35.533
Can you let that happen
to little Mei-Ling?

10:35.600 --> 10:37.767
Hasn't she suffered enough?

10:40.300 --> 10:42.533
Not as much as I have
listening to that story.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.266
Oh.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.633
Forget the story.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.066
You have to tell Dorothy.
She's your friend.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.266
You're right.
She is my best friend.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.266
I thought I was your best friend.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.066
You were till you told
me that story.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.934
-Thank you.
-Good night, Dorothy.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.300
Good night, Elliot.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.533
Oh, Dorothy. Dorothy,
I thought you'd never come home.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.767
I have to talk to you.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.400
-Is something wrong? Is it ma?
-Oh, no, no. She's fine.

11:11.467 --> 11:14.533
It's just that you're out
so late on a school night.

11:16.934 --> 11:17.800
What?

11:18.300 --> 11:21.100
I mean,
how was your date with Elliot?

11:21.166 --> 11:23.100
Wonderful, as usual.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.300
Dorothy,
I have to tell you something.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.266
It's just so hard.
I don't know how to tell you,

11:30.333 --> 11:33.266
except, I guess, just straight out.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.367
What?

11:35.300 --> 11:37.367
(gulps) Well...

11:40.066 --> 11:41.100
Elliot made...

11:43.233 --> 11:44.066
Elliot made...

11:47.133 --> 11:47.967
What?

11:49.133 --> 11:50.166
Elliot made a...

11:51.166 --> 11:54.200
what? What did Elliot make,
a ship in a bottle? What?

11:56.667 --> 11:58.066
Elliot made a pass at me.

11:59.533 --> 12:01.266
Elliot made a pass at you?

12:02.367 --> 12:04.600
You mean, he winked at you.
He winks at everyone.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.533
He's a very big winker.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.233
No. It was more than a wink.

12:09.700 --> 12:12.000
He came up to me,
and he put his big,

12:12.066 --> 12:15.600
masculine arms around
my tiny, little waist.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.867
-I don't believe you.
-What?

12:20.934 --> 12:24.400
I don't believe that he put his big,
masculine arms

12:24.467 --> 12:26.867
around your alleged tiny,
little waist.

12:27.967 --> 12:29.734
Dorothy, why would
I make up such a thing?

12:29.800 --> 12:31.767
-Because you're jealous.
-Jealous?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.834
You are used to getting
all the attention around here,

12:33.900 --> 12:36.433
and suddenly someone comes along
and wants me and not you

12:36.500 --> 12:38.166
and it is eating your guts out.

12:38.233 --> 12:41.133
-Eating my guts out?
-You know something?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.834
You could never be a real friend
to another woman,

12:43.900 --> 12:45.133
-and you know why?
-Why?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.934
-Because you're a slut!
-A slut?

12:48.033 --> 12:49.567
Don't repeat everything I say.

12:49.633 --> 12:52.100
Don't repeat everything you say? I'm
not repeating everything you say.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.400
-You just did.
-I did not.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.000
Nothing you say is worth repeating.

12:55.066 --> 13:01.300
You, Blanche, are an amoral,
backstabbing, self-centered jezebel,

13:01.367 --> 13:02.900
and I am very glad
that this happened

13:02.967 --> 13:05.767
because now I know really
what kind of person you are.

13:05.834 --> 13:09.000
The hell with you and your oversexed
boyfriend, Dorothy Zbornak!

13:09.066 --> 13:12.033
I'm just glad that little mei-ling's
coming-out party was ruined.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.533
Who?

13:20.600 --> 13:24.266
And, I'm glad that Elliot is bonging
every woman at your country club!

13:26.500 --> 13:28.533
What the hell are
you talking about?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.500
Ask the towel lady!

13:45.367 --> 13:48.000
Morning, Blanche.
Can I get you some coffee?

13:49.667 --> 13:52.700
"Dorothy deserves to know what kind
of a person Elliot really is.

13:52.767 --> 13:54.667
If you're her friend,
you'll tell her."

13:54.734 --> 13:56.367
Thanks for the advice, Rose.

13:56.433 --> 13:59.200
Now Dorothy's not speaking to me,
and I'm not speaking to you.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.500
Now you can get me that coffee.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.266
Blanche, I know it doesn't
feel like it right now,

14:05.333 --> 14:08.166
but you did the right thing
by telling Dorothy about Elliot.

14:08.233 --> 14:10.967
-What about Elliot?
-He made a pass at me.

14:11.033 --> 14:13.834
-While he's seeing my Dorothy?
-Yes.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.867
I can't believe it!

14:15.934 --> 14:18.000
My daughter is finally
dating a doctor,

14:18.066 --> 14:20.100
he turns out to be
a scuzz bucket!

14:22.233 --> 14:24.433
Why does everything
happen to me?

14:25.500 --> 14:26.867
Dorothy hates me.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.767
Oh, Blanche,
that's not true!

14:28.834 --> 14:31.266
Oh, yes, it is, and I hate
her right back double.

14:32.633 --> 14:34.033
Now get me some cream.

14:37.834 --> 14:40.600
Morning, Dorothy. Blanche and
I were just having some coffee.

14:40.667 --> 14:41.967
Would you care to join us?

14:42.033 --> 14:45.667
Frankly, Rose, I would rather
use Willie Nelson's hairbrush.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.367
Must you attack everything southern?

14:52.133 --> 14:55.467
Come on, now, girls.
This is no way to behave.

14:55.533 --> 14:59.133
Isn't there some way we can
settle this like rational adults?

14:59.200 --> 15:01.967
We can, once Dorothy
stops acting like a child.

15:02.033 --> 15:04.967
I am acting like a child?
Do you know what your problem is?

15:05.033 --> 15:06.900
-(doorbell rings)
-That's Elliot. I have to leave.

15:06.967 --> 15:10.433
How dare you leave in the middle
of a fight? You come back here!

15:10.500 --> 15:13.000
I have a few things
I want to say to you, missy!

15:13.066 --> 15:16.533
All right, girls, now hold it right
there, and I'm not fooling around!

15:19.100 --> 15:21.500
Dorothy, I think you have
to confront Elliot

15:21.567 --> 15:22.900
with Blanche's accusation.

15:22.967 --> 15:25.467
Absolutely not!
Now, I have to go.

15:28.033 --> 15:29.734
Morning, Dorothy.
Ready to go?

15:30.567 --> 15:31.633
Not quite.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.900
Elliot, Blanche says that you
made a pass at her.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.600
-What?
-You heard her.

15:40.834 --> 15:41.734
I don't know what to say.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.467
Well, you sure knew
what to say last night.

15:44.533 --> 15:47.233
Elliot, did you make
a pass at Blanche or not?

15:47.300 --> 15:49.900
-Absolutely not.
-He's lying.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.500
Look at him, he's twitching...

15:53.333 --> 15:54.700
and blinking.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.567
He's lying and twitching
and blinking.

15:58.066 --> 16:00.166
He is blinking, Dorothy.

16:01.767 --> 16:04.133
Maybe I had better
wait for you in the car.

16:05.433 --> 16:07.633
Dorothy, you just
have to believe me.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.000
It's not enough

16:09.066 --> 16:11.967
that you have had half the men
in Dade County.

16:12.667 --> 16:16.000
You have to have everyone
else's men. It is pathetic.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.266
I have just never felt
so betrayed in all my life.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.900
I haven't been a good friend
to a lot of people,

16:21.967 --> 16:24.033
but I have been a very good
friend to you, Dorothy.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.367
And you take some
stranger's word over mine?

16:27.633 --> 16:28.967
I'm not gonna stand for this,

16:29.033 --> 16:30.867
not in my own house.
I want you out of here.

16:30.934 --> 16:33.300
Blanche, you don't mean that.
Dorothy, she doesn't mean it.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.867
I do so mean it!

16:34.934 --> 16:37.633
I'll be out as soon
as I can find a place.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.133
Blanche, you can't just throw
Dorothy out on the street!

16:43.200 --> 16:44.667
You just watch me.

16:47.133 --> 16:49.367
(yelps)

16:58.467 --> 17:00.734
What's the matter, Sophia?
You couldn't sleep, either?

17:00.800 --> 17:02.400
No, I was sleeping great, Rose.

17:02.467 --> 17:04.867
I just wanted to show off
my pajamas.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.333
I'm upset about Dorothy
and Blanche.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.667
Oh, me too.

17:17.734 --> 17:20.967
Who would believe that they'd break
up their friendship over a man?

17:21.033 --> 17:22.133
It happens.

17:23.100 --> 17:24.300
What can we do?

17:24.367 --> 17:26.900
-Nothing. Just stay out of it.
-I can't do that.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.367
Let me tell you a story.

17:31.033 --> 17:33.767
Sicily, 1912. Picture this...

17:34.800 --> 17:38.734
two young girls, best friends
who shared three things,

17:38.800 --> 17:41.533
a pizza recipe,
some dough, and a dream.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.066
Everything is going great,
until one day,

17:45.133 --> 17:49.066
a fast-talking pepperoni salesman
gallops into town.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.934
Of course, both girls
are impressed.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.400
He dates one, one night,
the other, the next night.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.400
Pretty soon, he drives
a wedge between them.

18:00.367 --> 18:02.600
Before you know it,
the pizza suffers,

18:02.667 --> 18:05.300
the business suffers,
the friendship suffers.

18:05.367 --> 18:08.333
The girls part company
and head for America,

18:08.400 --> 18:10.433
never to see one another again.

18:11.567 --> 18:15.266
Rose,
one of those girls was me.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.800
The other one you probably
know as mama Celeste.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.533
Sophia, what's the point?

18:34.033 --> 18:37.066
The point is, I lost a fortune!

18:39.100 --> 18:40.467
Well, what does that
have to do with

18:40.533 --> 18:42.600
getting Dorothy and Blanche
back together?

18:42.667 --> 18:44.633
Nothing!
I told you, stay out of it!

18:44.700 --> 18:46.066
I can't!

18:46.133 --> 18:49.066
I can't just stand by
and watch this happen.

18:49.133 --> 18:51.033
I've got to do something.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.667
That might work too.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.633
<i>Abbondanza!</i>

19:10.567 --> 19:12.567
Rose, honey,
can I borrow your golf gloves?

19:12.633 --> 19:13.900
I already packed mine.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.834
Only if you promise
not to move out.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.500
I cannot promise that!

19:18.567 --> 19:20.300
Then putt with bare hands.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.734
(doorbell rings)

19:26.000 --> 19:27.600
Hi. Ready to go?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.867
Soon as Rose lends
me some gloves.

19:29.934 --> 19:33.033
They're in the bottom drawer
on the left, under my clarinet.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.367
Be right back.

19:51.633 --> 19:55.934
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like Jerry Vale?

19:57.333 --> 19:59.500
-No.
-They should.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.233
He's the only man in the world

20:02.300 --> 20:05.233
that can make the hair
on my arms stand up.

20:07.734 --> 20:09.166
Can I fix you a drink?

20:10.467 --> 20:11.533
No, thanks.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.000
Is something wrong with your leg?

20:14.133 --> 20:18.066
Nothing you can't fix,
doctor man.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.467
I beg your pardon?

20:19.533 --> 20:23.133
I know I look square,
but I'm like my father's tractor.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.700
I take a while to warm up,
but once I get going,

20:26.767 --> 20:29.567
I can turn your topsoil
till the cows come home.

20:33.367 --> 20:34.433
Rose, please.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.867
Wanna see some Polaroids
of me in my tennis skirt?

20:37.934 --> 20:41.433
Look, Rose, I'm flattered,
and please, no offense,

20:41.500 --> 20:43.266
but you're just not my type.

20:43.767 --> 20:46.633
-But Blanche was.
-That never happened.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.800
Oh, yes, it did. Blanche
told me all about it.

20:48.867 --> 20:51.233
-She made it up.
-I don't think so.

20:51.300 --> 20:55.333
Look, nothing came of it.
I did apologize to her.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.266
-And you lied to me.
-Dorothy!

20:58.333 --> 21:00.500
You lied to me about Blanche!

21:00.567 --> 21:03.400
Dorothy, sweetheart,
please try to understand.

21:03.467 --> 21:04.633
It was no big deal.

21:04.700 --> 21:05.633
Oh, you think so?

21:05.700 --> 21:08.867
I probably lost one of
my best friends because of you.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.834
To me, that's a very big deal.

21:11.333 --> 21:12.967
I take it we're not playing golf.

21:13.033 --> 21:15.633
We are not playing
anything anymore.

21:17.100 --> 21:20.100
Well, I call you in a few days
when you've cooled down.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.767
Don't bother.
I really have nothing to say to you.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.967
-I'm so sorry, Dorothy.
-No, I'm the one who's sorry.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.734
I have to go talk to Blanche.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.567
I've been an idiot
through this whole thing!

21:36.667 --> 21:38.367
Darn right you have.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.700
(gasps)

21:46.900 --> 21:48.800
-(knock on door)
-Come in.

21:50.834 --> 21:51.967
Oh, it's you.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.500
Look, Blanche, we have to talk.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.600
I don't believe I have anything
to say to you, Dorothy.

22:00.667 --> 22:03.033
Then let me do the talking.

22:03.100 --> 22:06.600
Elliot was just here and he told me
the truth about what happened.

22:08.233 --> 22:11.066
Well, I hate to say, "I told
you so," but I did. I told you so!

22:14.100 --> 22:18.166
Honey,
I'm sorry for not believing you.

22:18.233 --> 22:21.700
-There's no excuse for my behavior.
-There most certainly isn't.

22:21.767 --> 22:23.734
I guess when it came down to it,
I didn't believe you

22:23.800 --> 22:25.834
because I didn't want to.

22:25.900 --> 22:28.600
Nobody ever believes me
when I'm telling the truth.

22:29.367 --> 22:31.734
I guess it's the curse of being
a devastatingly beautiful woman.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.367
Oh, please!

22:36.367 --> 22:38.300
The only other woman
who could possibly understand

22:38.367 --> 22:40.467
what I've been through
is Priscilla Presley...

22:43.233 --> 22:44.600
and Susan Anton.

22:45.734 --> 22:47.567
No, not Susan Anton.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.834
Even my husband didn't believe me
on my wedding night

22:49.900 --> 22:51.333
when I told him he was the first.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.166
But George wasn't your first.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.967
Well, he didn't know that!

22:57.767 --> 22:59.600
The point is,
he didn't believe me.

23:00.533 --> 23:04.567
Look, Blanche...
Blanche, I'm sorry.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.767
Now, do you think you
can ever forgive me?

23:06.834 --> 23:08.400
I don't know.
I have to think about it.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.700
I understand.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.033
Ok, I've thought about it.
I forgive you!

23:17.133 --> 23:19.467
Oh, Blanche,
Blanche, thank you!

23:19.533 --> 23:20.934
Oh, what the heck!

23:21.000 --> 23:23.100
That's what friendship's
all about.

23:24.266 --> 23:28.400
Oh, Blanche, Dorothy!
Oh, I'm so glad you made up.

23:28.467 --> 23:30.266
I knew you couldn't
stay mad for long.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.834
Of course, we couldn't.

23:31.900 --> 23:35.667
Oh, it takes a big woman to forgive
somebody calling her a slut.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.500
You!

23:42.934 --> 23:46.066
Fight over? Good.
Here, taste these.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.300
I'm conducting a pizza challenge.

23:48.367 --> 23:51.700
One of these is mine,
one is mama you-know-who's.

23:51.767 --> 23:53.767
Taste them and tell me
which you like better.

23:53.834 --> 23:57.133
If I'm right,
this could be worth millions.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.266
My face could be in
every freezer in America.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.500
A, definitely.

24:02.567 --> 24:05.000
-Yep, A.
-A. A, without a doubt.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.133
You can't pick men
and you can't pick pizza!
