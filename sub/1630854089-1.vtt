<i>In high school, they say</i>
<i>the best measure of success</i>

00:26.625 --> 00:29.958
<i>is, like, the clique you run with</i>
<i>or the accolades you receive.</i>

00:30.541 --> 00:32.750
<i>But my metric is a little different.</i>

00:32.833 --> 00:35.916
<i>You wanna you know how you can tell</i>
<i>when you've really reached the top?</i>

00:36.625 --> 00:38.916
<i>When someone wants to destroy you.</i>

00:41.833 --> 00:43.375
Who wants a bite of me?

00:43.458 --> 00:45.750
<i>Trick question.</i>
<i>Everyone wanted a bite of me.</i>

00:45.833 --> 00:47.375
<i>I know. So ominous.</i>

00:47.458 --> 00:50.958
<i>You're probably like, "Why is she talking</i>
<i>in riddles when her life looks perfect?"</i>

00:51.041 --> 00:53.916
<i>Listen, babe, in this story,</i>
<i>nothing is as it seems.</i>

00:54.000 --> 00:54.833
Bitch!

00:54.916 --> 00:56.458
<i>What's up</i>, Teen Vogue?

00:56.541 --> 00:59.416
I'd give my left and right tit
to be Drea Torres.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.000
Of course she's the Rosehill student

01:01.083 --> 01:02.875
that made it
onto the <i>Teen Vogue </i>Next Gen list.

01:02.958 --> 01:03.916
And she's only a junior.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.666
God, Arianna,
you sound like you wanna wear her skin.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.708
She has amazing skin.

01:08.791 --> 01:11.416
She think
we don't know Tara paid for this party?

01:11.500 --> 01:13.166
I bet she only got on that list

01:13.250 --> 01:15.208
because she goes to Rosehill
on scholarship.

01:15.291 --> 01:18.125
Sage. You're not trying
to diminish the hard work

01:18.208 --> 01:20.416
of a fellow woman of color, are you?

01:21.333 --> 01:22.500
Cupcake?

01:25.500 --> 01:28.291
<i>-My girls and I are all about positivity…</i>
-Ooh!

01:28.375 --> 01:31.625
Oh my God. You are at peak powers tonight.

01:31.708 --> 01:33.458
I love you. I'm gagged.

01:33.541 --> 01:35.833
I love you, and I love this party.

01:35.916 --> 01:37.583
Do you think I did too much?

01:41.083 --> 01:43.958
No. It's all really understated.

01:44.041 --> 01:44.916
You're right.

01:46.125 --> 01:49.333
We have a slight problem.
Allegra the Instagram witch is saying

01:49.416 --> 01:51.208
she saw you buy your dress
at Salvation Army.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.791
-What?
-She knows you can't afford anything else.

01:54.875 --> 01:56.083
And listen, we love you,

01:56.166 --> 01:58.500
and we think
it's chic and eco that you thrift.

01:58.583 --> 02:01.291
-We don't care that your mom is a--
-Stop talking.

02:01.375 --> 02:02.416
Yep. All right.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.916
Do you want me to push her in the pool,
light her hair on fire?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.750
Oh my God, Meghan!
Why is it always your first instinct

02:07.833 --> 02:09.166
to light someone's hair on fire?

02:09.250 --> 02:11.416
-Why isn't it yours?
-No. Okay?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.875
No, Meghan.
We're gonna deal with this elegantly

02:13.958 --> 02:17.166
and tell her to pack up her Ouija board
and go. Okay?

02:17.833 --> 02:18.666
We need Elliot.

02:18.750 --> 02:19.875
Elliot!

02:21.833 --> 02:22.833
Who summons me?

02:22.916 --> 02:24.333
Tell Allegra to leave.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.916
Why do I always gotta be the vibe killer?
Let Meghan do it.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.333
-She likes choosing violence.
-No. No one is choosing violence.

02:33.833 --> 02:36.750
I think it's time I make a toast.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.041
-Yeah. Tara, gather everyone.
-Mm-hmm.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.291
I'm gonna freshen up.

02:40.375 --> 02:41.416
Come on, ladies.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.541
You're getting crumbs all over me.

02:43.625 --> 02:44.458
Damn it!

02:47.541 --> 02:51.166
<i>If you haven't already gleaned,</i>
<i>my friends were born into this life,</i>

02:51.250 --> 02:53.500
<i>but I was more DIY.</i>

02:53.583 --> 02:56.500
<i>And before you judge me</i>
<i>for caring about status,</i>

02:56.583 --> 02:58.541
<i>everyone cares about status.</i>

02:58.625 --> 03:01.333
<i>I just knew</i>
<i>how to turn the dream into reality.</i>

03:01.416 --> 03:04.041
<i>In this moment,</i>
<i>I finally felt like I belonged.</i>

03:04.125 --> 03:08.500
<i>I spent 17 years</i>
<i>meticulously curating the perfect life.</i>

03:08.583 --> 03:11.583
<i>And now that I had it,</i>
<i>no one was going to take it away from me.</i>

03:19.000 --> 03:20.583
Clap more. Clap more.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.041
Stop!

03:23.458 --> 03:26.208
Thank you so much to everyone
for being here.

03:26.291 --> 03:30.666
And thank you to Tara
for throwing me this gorgeous party.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.000
-You're welcome.
-Yes, yes.

03:33.083 --> 03:36.500
And Meghan, Miss Editor Extraordinaire,

03:36.583 --> 03:40.041
this <i>Thorn </i>piece means
so much to me. Really.

03:42.833 --> 03:46.375
So, I actually wanted
to take this opportunity to, um…

03:47.166 --> 03:49.541
Actually, Allegra? Where's Allegra?

03:52.500 --> 03:53.500
Over here.

03:55.125 --> 03:59.583
Hey, babe.
You look incredible tonight, really.

03:59.666 --> 04:04.291
I love your little spider hat thing.
It's so… big.

04:04.375 --> 04:08.458
So, Allegra and I have been working
on this really cool project.

04:08.541 --> 04:10.958
Oh my God. No. Wait.
Don't film me. Film Allegra.

04:11.041 --> 04:14.458
So, after telling her
about my church's clothing drive,

04:14.541 --> 04:16.125
she generously pledged

04:16.208 --> 04:21.916
to donate her entire wardrobe
to low-income women in need.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.125
-Tomorrow, at the Salvation Army.

04:26.208 --> 04:29.791
But everybody give it up
for Allegra. Right?

04:29.875 --> 04:32.125
-Yeah!
-Mmm. Oh, stop.

04:32.208 --> 04:34.750
Love you, boo. So proud to know you.

04:36.666 --> 04:37.916
I love you, Drea!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.125
So do I.

04:41.541 --> 04:42.416
Hey, Dre.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.833
Apologies for my lateness, everybody.

04:45.916 --> 04:49.333
I was just putting the finishing touches
on my surprise. We good, Elliot?

04:49.416 --> 04:50.791
-Oh, absolutely, man.
-Oh?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.375
In three, two…

05:05.625 --> 05:07.500
-Everybody…

05:09.208 --> 05:14.041
…let's all raise our glasses
to Drea Torres and to her bright future.

05:14.125 --> 05:16.291
Yeah, Drea!

05:22.458 --> 05:23.458
Thank you.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.250
Thank you, guys.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.208
Tonight was fun.

05:30.291 --> 05:33.125
Yeah. I'm just bummed
we're gonna be apart all summer.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.000
Who am I gonna play with?

05:35.583 --> 05:37.250
You could play with yourself.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.708
-Oh.

05:41.791 --> 05:45.666
<i>Teen Vogue's</i> got some jokes, huh?
You've got some jokes.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.000
-Babe.
-Hmm?

05:50.875 --> 05:52.708
Tonight was really cute and everything,

05:52.791 --> 05:56.916
but you know I think
that<i> Teen Vogue </i>video is stupid, right?

05:57.916 --> 06:02.500
Like, I'm just trying to get into Yale,
and I need all the help I can get.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.000
Yeah, of course. 

06:05.083 --> 06:07.583
Yeah, those lists are definitely bullshit,

06:07.666 --> 06:10.791
but you looked
very, very hot in that video.

06:10.875 --> 06:11.958
-Yeah?
-Oh my God.

06:12.041 --> 06:15.916
-You think so?
-Yes. You were so hot.

06:16.666 --> 06:20.083
You know, maybe you could send me
something to keep me company this summer.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.416
What do you mean?

06:21.500 --> 06:23.250
Well, just like a little something.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.666
-Yeah?
-A little video.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.291
-A little video?
-Yeah.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.583
-You really want me to?
-Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.375
I love you.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.250
I love you too.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.583
Can you kiss me?

06:40.166 --> 06:41.083
Yeah.

07:08.666 --> 07:09.708
<i>I'm Drea Torres,</i>

07:09.791 --> 07:12.708
<i>and I am so stoked to be part</i>
<i>of the Next Gen 100,</i>

07:12.791 --> 07:14.875
<i>-a list that celebrates the brightest--</i>

07:27.041 --> 07:29.791
I don't believe
that Montana's actually celiac.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.416
I won't choose some random restaurant
for my birthday dinner

07:32.500 --> 07:35.583
just because another restaurant
has a better gluten-free menu.

07:35.666 --> 07:38.583
Makes no sense.
Like, she's so selfish sometimes.

07:38.666 --> 07:43.000
I'm sorry. Am I being paranoid,
or is everyone staring at me right now?

07:43.083 --> 07:44.666
And, like, not in a good way.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.208
She has to be like…

07:46.291 --> 07:48.166
- Loved your video, Drea.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.875
Drea.

07:53.583 --> 07:54.416
What?

07:54.500 --> 07:55.375
What?

07:55.458 --> 07:58.750
-<i>Max.</i>
-Drea the cam girl.

07:58.833 --> 07:59.708
Oh my God.

08:01.875 --> 08:02.916
Max.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I'm already on the phone
talking to my dad's lawyer.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.750
Um, I gotta go. Thank you, Derek.

08:06.833 --> 08:08.625
Hey.

08:08.708 --> 08:10.250
How could you do this to me?

08:11.916 --> 08:12.791
What?

08:13.833 --> 08:15.708
I didn't do this. I got hacked.

08:16.541 --> 08:19.333
-Baby, come on. I would never do this.

08:21.416 --> 08:22.500
I love you.

08:26.833 --> 08:27.708
Easy, Mayweather.

08:27.791 --> 08:29.208
This is bullshit.

08:31.875 --> 08:33.333
I'm sorry you feel that way.

08:34.416 --> 08:36.583
-Will your mother be joining us?
-No.

08:37.166 --> 08:40.041
She works nights, so she's asleep.

08:40.125 --> 08:43.500
Drea, I want you to know
this brings me absolutely no pleasure.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.291
If you had just come to me
when you saw the video, we--

08:46.375 --> 08:47.791
Oh, so this is my fault?

08:48.583 --> 08:50.333
The video? Of course not.

08:51.166 --> 08:54.625
The way you handled it,
that leaves much to be desired.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.916
Drea, we all have hard truths
to contend with.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.291
Yours is that your peers
have the luxury of operating on impulse.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.791
You don't.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.958
The only way for you to get ahead
is to be smarter.

09:08.625 --> 09:11.333
And I thought you were a girl
who was smarter.

09:11.833 --> 09:12.958
I am smarter.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.833
That being said…

09:15.916 --> 09:18.458
…you did sucker punch
Rosehill's golden boy.

09:18.541 --> 09:20.208
Impressive, by the way.

09:21.625 --> 09:25.000
So, I am putting you
on behavioral probation,

09:25.083 --> 09:27.500
along with mandatory community service.

09:27.583 --> 09:30.875
And if you have any altercations with Max,

09:30.958 --> 09:35.250
as your headmaster, I will have no choice
but to revoke your scholarship.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.458
Today, you let your anger control you.

09:39.458 --> 09:42.875
From now on, I want you to control it.

09:43.458 --> 09:47.083
Channel that anger
into getting what you want.

09:49.208 --> 09:52.625
<i>So obviously, that video's fucked,</i>
<i>but Max didn't leak it.</i>

09:52.708 --> 09:54.875
<i>He wouldn't do that, Drea.</i>

09:54.958 --> 09:59.000
<i>Punching him has really put us all</i>
<i>in a weird spot. He's like our family.</i>

09:59.083 --> 10:02.208
<i>I think we all just need the summer</i>
<i>to process. See you next year.</i>

10:02.291 --> 10:04.625
<i>So much for believing women.</i>

10:04.708 --> 10:08.750
<i>That day, my life went up in flames,</i>
<i>and there was nothing I could do</i>

10:08.833 --> 10:10.791
<i>If I went after Max</i>
<i>and lost my scholarship,</i>

10:10.875 --> 10:12.875
<i>I'd have to kiss my future goodbye.</i>

10:12.958 --> 10:17.041
<i>I kept asking myself the same question.</i>
<i>Why would he do this to me?</i>

10:17.125 --> 10:19.416
<i>Looking back,</i>
<i>it was a classic Icarus story.</i>

10:19.500 --> 10:22.875
<i>I flew too close to the sun,</i>
<i>so my boyfriend leaked my sex tape.</i>

10:22.958 --> 10:24.583
<i>I hated Max,</i>

10:24.666 --> 10:28.833
<i>but even more than that, I hated myself</i>
<i>for letting my guard down.</i>

10:33.500 --> 10:35.166
<i>The headmaster was right.</i>

10:35.250 --> 10:39.750
<i>I needed to channel my anger,</i>
<i>and that is exactly what I did.</i>

10:45.125 --> 10:47.458
<i>Peaking in high school is cringe anyway.</i>

11:17.208 --> 11:18.541
<i> Eleanor, I am so delighted</i>

11:18.625 --> 11:20.291
<i>you wanted to go</i>
<i>to tennis camp this summer.</i>

11:20.375 --> 11:22.916
<i>Dare I say you might finally make</i>
<i>some real friends?</i>

11:23.000 --> 11:26.666
Oh, Mama, that's very rude.
What about Oscar Winner Olivia Colman?

11:26.750 --> 11:29.125
<i>Your pet lizard is not a friend.</i>

11:29.208 --> 11:31.000
<i>Remember what Dr. Gratch said.</i>

11:31.083 --> 11:32.625
<i>-To move forward…</i>
Mom-- I can't--

11:32.708 --> 11:35.333
<i>-…you must open up to new experiences.</i>
-Bridge--

11:35.416 --> 11:37.958
-Hear--
-<i>Eleanor? Eleanor, can you hear me?</i>

11:47.833 --> 11:50.750
<i>Well, it took me</i>
<i>all of 45 minutes to realize</i>

11:50.833 --> 11:52.416
<i>this was a huge mistake.</i>

11:52.500 --> 11:55.708
<i>I was a Billie Jean King</i>
<i>in a sea of Maria Sharapovas,</i>

11:55.791 --> 11:58.416
<i>but my pilgrimage wasn't for nothing.</i>

11:58.958 --> 12:03.583
<i>My entire life was about to change,</i>
<i>and it all started with her.</i>

12:03.666 --> 12:06.166
-Is that Drea the tennis pro?
-<i>No, not her.</i>

12:08.250 --> 12:09.250
<i>Her.</i>

12:09.333 --> 12:10.208
Sorry.

12:10.291 --> 12:11.416
<i> Drea Torres.</i>

12:11.500 --> 12:14.958
<i>She doesn't know it yet,</i>
<i>but we're about to become besties.</i>

12:15.041 --> 12:16.583
Are you okay?

12:17.708 --> 12:19.708
How did you even get the video?

12:19.791 --> 12:21.875
I'm not revealing my sources.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.416
Just feels kind of messed-up.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.750
It's embarrassing enough
that she's our age and works here,

12:26.833 --> 12:29.250
but now everyone has seen her sex tape.

12:34.166 --> 12:35.291
Are you listening to us?

12:36.833 --> 12:37.666
No.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.666
You just have, like, a really…
…weird energy.

12:41.750 --> 12:44.625
-I don't quite know what to do with it.
-We don't know what to do with it.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.916
<i> My therapist,</i>
<i>the beloved Dr. Gratch,</i>

12:47.000 --> 12:48.875
<i>says that hurt people hurt people,</i>

12:48.958 --> 12:51.125
<i>but I just don't think</i>
<i>that applies to teenage girls.</i>

12:51.208 --> 12:53.750
<i>I think sometimes they're just evil.</i>

12:59.833 --> 13:00.916
It was Erica.

13:02.375 --> 13:06.000
The one who showed everyone
that video of you. Erica Norman.

13:08.041 --> 13:08.916
She sucks.

13:09.541 --> 13:11.750
She's mean in a way
I didn't know existed anymore.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.708
She's like a Bitchasaurus rex.

13:14.916 --> 13:16.375
I'm sorry. Who are you?

13:16.458 --> 13:17.375
Eleanor.

13:18.041 --> 13:20.458
I don't need your pity, Eleanor.

13:31.625 --> 13:35.333
This is insane! I don't even do cocaine!

13:35.416 --> 13:38.125
Don't you think I would know
if she was doing cocaine?

13:38.208 --> 13:39.500
Just awful.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.166
-Drea!
-What's up?

13:41.250 --> 13:44.375
You insufferable cunt,
I know you did this.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.333
-You fra-- She framed me!
-You framed her!

13:48.166 --> 13:49.458
Oh, sweetie.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.333
Are you listening to yourself right now?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.416
You think I framed you?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.541
You framed her.

13:56.583 --> 13:57.625
Babe…

14:00.208 --> 14:01.750
are you on drugs right now?

14:02.458 --> 14:05.666
I don't do cocaine!

14:05.750 --> 14:09.583
-She doesn't even know what it looks like.
-I don't know what it looks like!

14:09.666 --> 14:12.291
I swear to God. I don't even do coke!

14:12.375 --> 14:14.666
I'm telling you, she's innocent!

14:14.750 --> 14:17.125
Take care, hon. We'll miss you.

14:17.208 --> 14:18.958
Jessica! Do something!

14:19.041 --> 14:22.500
So sad. I really hope
she gets the help she needs.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.708
Pray for Erica.

14:23.791 --> 14:25.291
-Pray for Erica.
-Yeah.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.666
-Bye.
-Bye. See you next summer.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.333
-Bye.
-Bye.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.166
Come on.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.500
Hey.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.666
I know that sound. You're bricked.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.250
My dad restores classic cars.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.291
Do you want a ride, or…

14:47.625 --> 14:49.125
do you still not want my pity?

14:58.125 --> 15:00.750
I didn't watch the video, by the way.

15:02.791 --> 15:03.708
Congrats.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.875
You're the only one.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.041
Is that your ex who leaked it?

15:12.333 --> 15:15.333
-Is that why you punched him?
-Are you gonna talk this entire ride?

15:21.041 --> 15:22.291
How do you even know about that?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.958
I'm actually transferring to Rosehill.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.708
I, um… I saw a post about it.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.416
Moving before senior year?

15:30.208 --> 15:31.625
Ooph. Brutal.

15:32.458 --> 15:33.708
What happened to him?

15:34.458 --> 15:35.500
Your ex?

15:36.750 --> 15:39.583
Oh, you know, what happens to every guy.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.333
Nothing.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.041
I'm the slut on probation,

15:44.125 --> 15:47.208
and he and his tiny little dick
get away scot-free.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.208
They always get away scot-free.

15:49.291 --> 15:50.208
Mm-hmm.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.291
I know what it's like
to get screwed over

15:52.375 --> 15:54.166
by someone you thought you could trust.

15:54.666 --> 15:58.125
When I was 13, uh,
I went to day camp with this girl,

15:58.208 --> 16:00.250
and she existed on this like…

16:02.250 --> 16:04.416
untouchable plane. She glowed.

16:06.375 --> 16:09.000
I pretty much already knew
that I liked girls,

16:09.083 --> 16:10.333
but I hadn't told anyone yet.

16:12.250 --> 16:15.000
But this girl,
I guess I thought that if she liked me,

16:15.083 --> 16:17.458
it would validate
my entire existence or something,

16:17.541 --> 16:19.166
and I finally talked to her,

16:19.250 --> 16:22.208
and… it was great.

16:22.708 --> 16:27.791
Like, she made me feel
so free and confident and safe.

16:29.458 --> 16:32.166
And before I knew it,
I told her that I was queer.

16:33.375 --> 16:36.375
And it felt…. amazing.

16:36.458 --> 16:40.875
I mean, like, it was
the single greatest moment of my life.

16:41.791 --> 16:45.625
But I guess I wasn't as safe as I thought
because she told everyone

16:45.708 --> 16:47.958
that I tried to hold her down
and kiss her.

16:48.041 --> 16:48.875
What?

16:50.166 --> 16:51.250
Uh…

16:52.791 --> 16:53.625
Damn.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.583
Yeah. Um…

16:57.583 --> 17:00.083
It wasn't that she outed me.
I… I don't care.

17:00.875 --> 17:03.375
Everybody's fucking gay. I just…

17:04.791 --> 17:06.750
She turned me into this predator.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.458
No one would come near me.

17:11.666 --> 17:12.833
She destroyed me.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.708
No consequences for her, I assume.

17:16.791 --> 17:18.333
-Nope.

17:18.416 --> 17:20.291
She actually goes to Rosehill.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.833
Really? Who?

17:23.416 --> 17:24.541
It's Carissa Jones.

17:26.416 --> 17:27.416
Carissa…

17:28.708 --> 17:30.791
Wait. That crunchy granola lesbi--

17:32.625 --> 17:33.458
Yeah. I've seen her.

17:34.916 --> 17:35.750
Damn.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.708
Outed by your own team?

17:41.083 --> 17:42.250
What the fuck was that?

17:42.333 --> 17:43.291
Sorry.

17:43.375 --> 17:44.875
-Oh my God.
-Um…

17:45.708 --> 17:47.458
It just really helps sometimes.

17:47.541 --> 17:50.250
You should try it.
It… it'll really help with the Max stuff.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.125
I'm fine.
I don't even think about Max anymore.

17:52.208 --> 17:55.958
-Just do it.
-No. Absolutely not. Thank you, no.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.958
It's recommended by medical professionals.

17:58.041 --> 18:00.375
It's called a primal scream.
It helps you access parts--

18:05.791 --> 18:06.708
Fuck.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.208
You really had that pent-up, huh?

18:15.125 --> 18:17.500
You look like you want a grilled cheese.

18:18.458 --> 18:19.541
That sounds nice.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.250
Let's get you a grilled cheese.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.083
Why don't you transfer?

18:28.791 --> 18:30.208
Transfer where?

18:30.291 --> 18:32.708
-Anywhere.
-I'm not like you, Eleanor.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.333
My mom is a nurse

18:34.416 --> 18:38.750
who spent her whole life working
to ensure I can have a better future.

18:39.333 --> 18:43.625
I can't mess this up,
and Rosehill is my only path to Yale, so…

18:44.125 --> 18:46.125
What about your friends?

18:46.708 --> 18:48.250
You mean Max's friends?

18:48.875 --> 18:51.666
I didn't realize
how much power he wielded.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.666
You know, he makes you feel
so safe and protected,

18:55.750 --> 18:59.625
but it's all conditional on you
playing the role he wants you to play,

19:00.333 --> 19:02.916
which I thought I was doing,
but I guess not.

19:03.416 --> 19:05.208
We all love an emotional terrorist.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.958
Yeah, they're so fun.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.083
What about you?

19:09.166 --> 19:12.166
Why would you wanna go to school
with some bitch who ruined your life?

19:12.666 --> 19:13.500
I don't.

19:14.250 --> 19:17.791
I begged go to Dalton or Spence,

19:18.500 --> 19:21.375
but as much as I like to believe
I'm the arbiter of my own social calendar,

19:21.458 --> 19:22.958
my parents still call the shots,

19:23.041 --> 19:26.500
and they think that Rosehill
is the best path into an Ivy.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.083
They're not wrong.

19:28.666 --> 19:29.583
I'm dreading it.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.666
Same.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.416
Climate change is not a lie!
Please don't let our planet die!

19:40.500 --> 19:43.583
Climate change is not a lie!
Please don't let our planet die!

19:43.666 --> 19:47.416
Climate change is not a lie!
Please don't let our planet die!

19:48.833 --> 19:52.333
Yeah. The Greta Thunberg brigade
can be pretty intense.

19:52.416 --> 19:55.125
It's all smoke and mirrors.
I've seen all of them use a plastic straw.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.375
-Fuck you, Gabbi!
-The horror.

19:57.458 --> 19:58.416
I'm Gabbi.

19:59.166 --> 20:00.000
Are you new?

20:00.083 --> 20:00.958
I'm Eleanor.

20:01.666 --> 20:02.583
And kinda.

20:02.666 --> 20:03.750
You want a tour?

20:03.833 --> 20:06.416
I mean, as a disciple
of the '90s teen movie,

20:06.500 --> 20:08.333
I would be offended if I didn't get one.

20:08.416 --> 20:12.041
If you get offended, Rosehill does have
a designated safe space for that.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.666
All right, so over here,
we have our Instagram witches.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.875
Allegra, their leader,

20:18.958 --> 20:21.958
apparently made a girl levitate
at a sleepover playing Light as a Feather.

20:22.041 --> 20:25.666
Now she's queen of the zodiac thots,
and she's a Scorpio.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.583
Hot.

20:26.666 --> 20:27.958
The horny theater kids.

20:28.041 --> 20:31.708
Last year, they tried to mount
a mostly white production of <i>Hamilton</i>.

20:31.791 --> 20:34.375
Lin-Manuel Miranda
sent a cease and desist.

20:34.458 --> 20:40.625
Um, coming up, we have our farm kids.
They run the school farm led by Carissa.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.958
When her request
to make Rosehill go vegan was denied,

20:44.041 --> 20:46.875
she left her DivaCup
in the middle of the cafeteria in protest.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.416
It was full.

20:49.916 --> 20:50.791
Um…

20:51.458 --> 20:52.916
Who are they?

20:53.750 --> 20:59.166
Uh, Rosehill's royal court,
the cream of the incredibly entitled crop.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.208
Be careful with them.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.500
They're all as calculated
as they are beautiful.

21:07.375 --> 21:08.625
-Oh shit.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.250
Drea Torres, their fallen queen.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.166
Stop. Stop.

21:13.916 --> 21:15.458
-Drea.
-Hey.

21:15.541 --> 21:16.625
Hey, ladies.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.375
I meant to text you.

21:20.958 --> 21:21.958
Obviously,

21:22.750 --> 21:25.125
the way last year ended was so…

21:27.041 --> 21:28.750
pretty sticky, you know,

21:28.833 --> 21:32.916
with Max's dad funding
my dad's reelection campaign.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.583
-I know, yeah.
-It's just so complicated.

21:34.666 --> 21:36.458
-I know. I know.
-Good. Oh my God.

21:36.541 --> 21:38.750
I thought you were gonna put out
a hit on me or something.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.625
No, why would I do that?

21:42.750 --> 21:44.208
Hey, Max.

21:44.791 --> 21:47.166
-How was your summer?
-Restorative.

21:47.250 --> 21:50.583
I'm glad to see you. I wasn't sure
you'd be back after, you know,

21:51.708 --> 21:52.541
last year.

21:52.625 --> 21:56.125
Oh, no, no. I'm not gonna let
a silly video stand between me and Yale.

21:56.208 --> 21:59.083
I just wanna say I hope
we can move on and be civil this year.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.000
Especially now that Tara and I are dating.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.708
Oh. You didn't know?

22:08.791 --> 22:10.500
No. No, I knew. Yeah.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.458
Good. Yeah,
our families summered together in Capri.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.666
That's great.
I mean, what a couple, right?

22:17.750 --> 22:19.416
Your fathers must be elated.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.416
-Oh. Stop, you two. Seriously, stop.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.750
All right, guys, so fun catching up.

22:25.833 --> 22:28.083
Um… Nice to see you ladies.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.375
Montana, you have grapes
in your teeth, babe. All right.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.041
-Enjoy senior year!
-Why didn't you tell me?

22:33.125 --> 22:35.916
<i>Feeling alone is</i>
<i>a specific type of pain,</i>

22:36.000 --> 22:39.708
<i>with distinct recognizable signs</i>
<i>to the trained eye.</i>

22:39.791 --> 22:43.666
<i>Drea and I, we were two wounded soldiers</i>
<i>on the battlefield of adolescence.</i>

22:44.250 --> 22:48.666
Hello, hello. Uh, if everyone
can please take their seats.

22:48.750 --> 22:51.916
Do you guys know, are the seats assigned,
or do we just sit anywhere?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.666
Cell phones away.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.750
Okay, I'll just go fuck myself.

22:57.541 --> 22:58.416
Nora.

22:59.750 --> 23:00.750
It's Eleanor now.

23:01.541 --> 23:04.791
-Wow. I… I almost didn't recognize you.
-Yeah.

23:04.875 --> 23:07.791
-I didn't know that you go here now.
-I do. I, um…

23:08.666 --> 23:09.875
I'm gonna find my seat. Okay?

23:09.958 --> 23:10.791
-Okay.
-Okay.

23:10.875 --> 23:14.708
Hello, hello, hello.
If everyone can please take their seats.

23:14.791 --> 23:18.750
-Who was that?
-Uh, some girl I used to go to camp with.

23:19.583 --> 23:22.208
You guys, I can't believe
she actually came back.

23:22.291 --> 23:25.000
I know.
She looks really cute, though.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.375
Montana, shut up.

23:26.458 --> 23:28.166
-She does. Sorry.
-What's wrong with you?

23:28.250 --> 23:31.708
I think it's pretty sick.
I had no idea she was that twisted.

23:31.791 --> 23:35.958
We have an announcement
from your senior class president,

23:36.041 --> 23:37.083
Max Broussard.

23:45.875 --> 23:46.875
Rosehill!

23:50.750 --> 23:51.958
Yeah!

23:52.041 --> 23:54.416
Thank you! Thank you!

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
Oh, it feels so good to be back.

23:56.583 --> 23:57.708
We love you, Max!

23:57.791 --> 23:59.541
Oh come on. Stop, stop.

23:59.625 --> 24:02.166
Thank you, though.
Thank you. I appreciate you.

24:02.250 --> 24:03.375
Um…

24:03.458 --> 24:08.416
Now, this… this year, uh,
this is gonna be such a great year.

24:08.500 --> 24:12.708
But before we get started, I was hoping
maybe I could get personal for a minute.

24:12.791 --> 24:14.541
-Get personal, man.

24:14.625 --> 24:19.166
Last year, my intimate exchanges made
their way into the world.

24:20.916 --> 24:23.083
It was a violation of my privacy.

24:23.166 --> 24:25.250
To be honest, I'm still recovering,

24:25.333 --> 24:28.875
but it really made me get in touch
with myself, and I realized that…

24:34.125 --> 24:35.041
Actually…

24:37.125 --> 24:39.375
Actually, Drea Torres,
could you stand, please?

24:40.583 --> 24:41.416
Please.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.375
Could you stand? Please?

24:46.458 --> 24:47.333
What?

24:47.416 --> 24:48.583
Where are you?

24:52.375 --> 24:55.208
-Dre?

24:56.958 --> 25:02.083
Dre, I just want to say how sorry I am
for what happened to you last year.

25:04.416 --> 25:07.791
And to anyone of you who watched,
or you shared that video,

25:07.875 --> 25:10.541
I sincerely hope you take the time
to examine why you did that.

25:11.875 --> 25:12.750
So, Dre,

25:13.750 --> 25:16.541
it's in your honor
that I'm founding a new club,

25:17.041 --> 25:22.958
the Cis Hetero Men Championing
Female-Identifying Students League.

25:23.041 --> 25:27.333
Now, it is for all the men at Rosehill
who want to do better.

25:27.416 --> 25:29.750
-Be allies.

25:29.833 --> 25:32.000
-Thank you.

25:32.083 --> 25:33.708
I want to be an ally!

25:47.416 --> 25:48.291
Fuck!

25:49.833 --> 25:51.750
-Drea?

25:53.750 --> 25:54.666
Hi.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.416
Just checking on you.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.708
Are you all right?

26:03.625 --> 26:06.666
He's, like, way worse than you described.

26:07.250 --> 26:10.208
I don't know how I'm gonna spend
an entire year at this school.

26:10.875 --> 26:11.708
I feel you.

26:13.083 --> 26:15.625
I talked to Carissa for, like, one minute,

26:15.708 --> 26:19.500
and it felt like dipping my toe
in Dante's eighth circle of hell.

26:19.583 --> 26:22.083
It was… awful.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.958
This sucks shit!

26:27.791 --> 26:28.625
Yeah.

26:42.291 --> 26:45.500
I wish that we could, like, hire people
to take them down.

26:47.416 --> 26:50.416
What? Like a fucked-up TaskRabbit?

26:50.500 --> 26:51.583
Yeah.

26:52.208 --> 26:54.583
Someone completely unconnected to us.

26:56.166 --> 26:59.916
A high school hit man… or woman or NB.

27:04.833 --> 27:05.750
Oh my God.

27:09.791 --> 27:10.625
You're right.

27:11.958 --> 27:13.416
You're absolutely right.

27:14.541 --> 27:16.708
They deserve to go down
for what they did to us,

27:16.791 --> 27:19.250
but we can't go after them ourselves.

27:21.750 --> 27:24.875
We should team up
and do each other's revenge.

27:30.291 --> 27:31.375
Oh, you're serious.

27:31.875 --> 27:32.791
Absolutely not.

27:32.875 --> 27:33.875
Why?

27:33.958 --> 27:36.458
Uh, because I'm not capable?

27:37.666 --> 27:41.250
I can't do revenge.

27:41.750 --> 27:46.541
I mean, is "do revenge" even,
like, correct grammar?

27:46.625 --> 27:48.333
Oh, I'm sorry, <i>Schoolhouse Rock!</i>

27:48.416 --> 27:50.708
Are you dragging
my sentence structure right now?

27:50.791 --> 27:52.541
Uh, we could get caught.

27:52.625 --> 27:54.500
We could not graduate.
We could get expelled.

27:54.583 --> 27:57.125
We won't get caught.
That's the whole point.

27:57.708 --> 27:59.875
No one knows we know each other, right?

27:59.958 --> 28:03.083
So no one will connect us to them,
to each other.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.416
It's literally perfect.

28:06.791 --> 28:11.625
With my brains and your… blank slate,

28:12.541 --> 28:14.083
we can get away with this.

28:14.166 --> 28:15.958
Don't you wanna make her pay?

28:16.833 --> 28:20.125
I don't want to make her pay.

28:21.375 --> 28:25.208
I want to burn her to the ground.

28:26.791 --> 28:28.250
Whoa.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.416
That gave me chills.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.416
Do you see this? My arm hair's up.

28:33.000 --> 28:33.833
Look at that.

28:34.458 --> 28:39.208
You're giving off some serious, like,
Glenn Close in <i>Fatal Attraction</i> energy.

28:40.625 --> 28:41.541
Glennergy.

28:41.625 --> 28:44.875
Yes. You're radiating Glennergy
right now.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.875
But if we're gonna make this work…

28:55.375 --> 28:56.541
we have to fix…

28:56.625 --> 28:57.583
No.

28:57.666 --> 28:58.500
…this.

28:58.583 --> 28:59.833
I really don't want to.

28:59.916 --> 29:00.833
We have to do…

29:00.916 --> 29:02.208
Oh, please don't say a makeover.

29:02.291 --> 29:04.375
-…a makeover!

29:04.458 --> 29:05.708
-Yay!
-It feels so problematic.

29:05.791 --> 29:07.708
It is, but it's fun!

29:07.791 --> 29:09.125
Let's start with Carissa.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.958
She'll be a cinch.
I can ruin her in my sleep.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.041
-Moving on to Max.
-Wait, go back. Why will Carissa be easy?

29:14.125 --> 29:16.750
Oh, honey, it is much easier
to destroy a girl.

29:16.833 --> 29:19.583
Take your pick. Slut-shame her,
turn her friends against her,

29:19.666 --> 29:23.958
prey on her vanity, turn her into a troll,
exploit her darkest secrets.

29:24.041 --> 29:26.875
Make her radioactive,
and no one will help her.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.166
Um, I actually really like this.

29:31.750 --> 29:32.583
Absolutely not.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.333
Ooh.

29:36.541 --> 29:40.333
It just so happens that I have to do
mandatory community service this year

29:40.416 --> 29:41.958
as penance for punching Max.

29:42.041 --> 29:44.916
I already emailed the headmaster
and requested the school farm,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.250
which is run by Carissa.

29:47.791 --> 29:49.625
Now, dudes, that's another story.

29:49.708 --> 29:54.416
For girls, our bodies, our choices,
our thoughts are all policed by shame.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.958
Our weaknesses are their strengths.

29:56.041 --> 29:57.875
If they have a lot of sex,
they're crushing it.

29:57.958 --> 30:00.708
If we do it, we're sluts.
If they're angry, they're powerful,

30:00.791 --> 30:02.208
but if we show any emotion…

30:02.291 --> 30:03.541
…we're hysterical!

30:03.625 --> 30:06.291
Ladies! Indoor voices please.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.750
Wait. How much are we cutting?

30:12.625 --> 30:16.875
If men in general are hard to take down,
Max is patriarchy incarnate.

30:16.958 --> 30:23.125
The ultimate manic pixie dream boy,
Max has a meticulously curated persona.

30:23.208 --> 30:26.541
Rosehill is an orchestra,
and Max is its conductor.

30:27.208 --> 30:30.291
Everyone loves him, which means
he can get away with anything.

30:30.875 --> 30:32.666
-I want to expose him.

30:33.166 --> 30:37.250
And to do that, we need undeniable proof
that he's a hypocrite,

30:38.125 --> 30:40.916
a fake-woke, misogynist motherfucker.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.583
If we can accomplish that,

30:44.708 --> 30:45.708
he's done.

30:45.791 --> 30:46.625
Blot.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.958
<i>You are now and forevermore</i>

30:51.041 --> 30:54.791
<i>the coolest, most mysterious student</i>
<i>at Rosehill Country Day.</i>

30:54.875 --> 30:57.958
<i>I'm Frankenstein,</i>
<i>and you're Frankenstein's bad bitch.</i>

31:00.250 --> 31:03.833
-Your new vibe is high-status cunt.

31:05.958 --> 31:07.708
You ready to be my woman on the inside?

31:07.791 --> 31:10.125
-No. For sure no.
-Eleanor.

31:10.708 --> 31:14.333
It's gonna be fine.
My entire life I've been a chameleon.

31:14.416 --> 31:18.083
Sometimes you have to pretend
to be someone else to get what you want.

31:18.166 --> 31:19.916
Do you ever worry
that you'll lose yourself?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.875
Oh my God! Don't be so dramatic.
All I'm asking you to do

31:22.958 --> 31:25.291
is disassociate from your body
and be someone you're not

31:25.375 --> 31:27.625
so these popular kids will invite you
to be in their group.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.541
-Are you in therapy?
-God, no. Why?

31:30.333 --> 31:31.208
Cool.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.875
And we're not concerned that Max
is gonna realize we're manipulating him?

31:37.791 --> 31:41.500
Narcissists are too busy
thinking about themselves

31:41.583 --> 31:43.333
to realize they're being played.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.333
<i>Getting a girl's attention</i>
<i>requires weeks if not months of work.</i>

31:49.416 --> 31:51.583
<i>But according to Drea,</i>
<i>getting a guy's attention</i>

31:51.666 --> 31:54.708
<i>requires you walking past them once</i>
<i>looking vaguely slutty.</i>

31:54.791 --> 31:56.791
Who's that? Is she new?

31:56.875 --> 31:59.916
I don't know,
but she is making that uniform work.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.875
Yeesh.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.125
Oh shit.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.166
<i>Dodos.</i>

32:06.166 --> 32:07.208
<i>Working at the farm</i>

32:07.291 --> 32:09.208
<i>was certainly not</i>
<i>on my senior year bucket list</i>

32:09.291 --> 32:11.375
<i>but neither was being a social pariah.</i>

32:11.458 --> 32:14.375
<i>Carissa was an easy target.</i>
<i>I'm incredible with new people.</i>

32:14.458 --> 32:15.583
Carissa, right?

32:17.916 --> 32:19.250
Yeah, we've met before.

32:19.333 --> 32:21.625
You called me a human Birkenstock.

32:21.708 --> 32:22.541
Cool.

32:22.625 --> 32:25.750
I just want to say, I'm so excited
to be working at the farm.

32:25.833 --> 32:28.458
I've always been very intrigued
by what you do here.

32:28.541 --> 32:32.000
You should talk to Russ.
He's in charge of the, uh, volunteers.

32:32.708 --> 32:34.291
Oh. Um,

32:34.375 --> 32:38.291
actually, I was hoping I could learn
from you, you know, farm queen.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.666
Yeah, I'm busy planning the menu
for the ring ceremony.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.791
And, you know, for the record,

32:44.875 --> 32:48.875
ass-kissing is not gonna get you anywhere
on this farm. It's honest work.

32:49.958 --> 32:52.041
Hey, Russ? Show Drea the ropes?

32:53.708 --> 32:55.500
<i>Shoe-faced veggie fucker.</i>

33:11.666 --> 33:12.500
I love Saunders.

33:14.416 --> 33:16.583
-Cool.
-I studied him at Yale.

33:16.666 --> 33:19.333
I just did
their literary arts summer program.

33:20.458 --> 33:21.333
Cool.

33:23.583 --> 33:25.500
Do you say anything other than "cool"?

33:25.583 --> 33:26.750
So cool.

33:30.541 --> 33:33.833
So, Carissa's cooking
the ring ceremony dinner?

33:33.916 --> 33:36.500
Yeah. It's gonna be her big break
in the culinary world.

33:37.666 --> 33:38.708
What's that?

33:38.791 --> 33:42.208
That's a greenhouse, clearly.

33:42.291 --> 33:43.916
It's where Carissa
grows her special crops.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.750
Flies them in from all over the world.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.500
-Who are you texting?

34:04.583 --> 34:07.958
My ex-girlfriend is mad that I hooked up
with my ex-boyfriend.

34:11.208 --> 34:12.541
Can I see your hand, please?

34:12.625 --> 34:14.291
-This okay?
-Mm-hmm.

34:16.541 --> 34:19.666
I'm having a, um… party this weekend.

34:20.708 --> 34:23.125
It's a little pre-homecoming celebration.

34:23.625 --> 34:24.583
You should come.

34:27.041 --> 34:28.250
Make your exes jealous.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.166
I'll think about it.

34:32.041 --> 34:32.875
Cool.

34:34.250 --> 34:35.958
Just, uh, don't think too hard.

34:36.791 --> 34:39.208
Bring your swimsuit, floaty.
It's gonna be lit.

34:41.916 --> 34:43.875
Yes!

34:49.666 --> 34:51.458
Your little dress I made you
looks great.

34:52.041 --> 34:54.208
Do you love it? You love it.

34:55.750 --> 34:58.708
So, what's the deal
with this little dinosaur thing?

34:58.791 --> 35:02.416
Oscar Winner Olivia Colman
is my emotional support bearded dragon.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.750
My therapist told me to get a puppy,

35:04.833 --> 35:08.333
but I prefer to keep my companions
thick-skinned and cold-blooded.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.208
Oh my fucking God.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.333
Do I really have to wear this?

35:16.958 --> 35:17.791
Yes.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.000
You have to look impossibly hot

35:20.083 --> 35:23.750
but also like you spent exactly one minute
putting yourself together.

35:23.833 --> 35:25.958
It's important
that the girls covet your look.

35:31.208 --> 35:33.833
Why are you wiggling around
like your tampon's sliding out?

35:35.041 --> 35:38.791
I haven't worn a bathing suit
in public, like, ever.

35:39.916 --> 35:42.125
Carissa really did a number on you, huh?

35:47.208 --> 35:48.041
Forget her.

35:49.166 --> 35:52.208
You are so much cooler than any
of those dodos going to Max's party.

35:52.833 --> 35:55.083
I just want to eat my lunch
on her shattered ego.

35:56.916 --> 36:00.291
I love that for you.
We're gonna take care of her soon.

36:00.375 --> 36:03.416
There's a greenhouse
with this massive padlock on it

36:03.500 --> 36:05.083
that only she can access,

36:05.166 --> 36:09.166
and my Spidey senses tell me
she's not just growing sunchokes in there.

36:11.291 --> 36:13.041
I need to get her keys.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.916
-Perfect.
-Hmm.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.791
Now, go get the dirt on Max
and make revenge mommy proud.

36:25.625 --> 36:29.250
<i>I know I looked confident,</i>
<i>but I was profusely sweating everywhere.</i>

36:29.333 --> 36:30.166
There she is.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.333
<i>I tried to bring</i>
<i>my emotional support lizard,</i>

36:32.416 --> 36:33.750
<i>but Drea said no.</i>

36:33.833 --> 36:35.708
-Champagne?
-Uh, yes.

36:40.375 --> 36:41.208
Over here!

36:41.291 --> 36:44.750
I'll introduce you to some friends,
all right? These are good people. Yo.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.333
Kids, this is Eleanor.

36:46.416 --> 36:48.250
-Hey. Hey.
-Eleanor, this is my family.

36:48.333 --> 36:49.625
-Hi.
-Hello.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.000
Hi, cutie.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.541
-Yo, you made it.
-Hi.

36:52.625 --> 36:53.875
And you brought a bathing suit.

36:53.958 --> 36:55.250
Sit down, Elliot.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.458
Appreciate you.

36:56.541 --> 37:00.083
Hi. I'm Tara. This is Meghan, Montana.

37:00.708 --> 37:03.416
I love your hat.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.541
-Oh.
-Where did you get it? Can I have it?

37:05.625 --> 37:07.583
-Meghan, don't scare her.

37:07.666 --> 37:09.041
Eleanor, come join us.

37:09.750 --> 37:10.625
Come on.

37:10.708 --> 37:12.583
Shit. Get cozy.

37:15.416 --> 37:17.958
This is so cute.

37:18.041 --> 37:19.166
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.625
Why don't I know you?

37:21.708 --> 37:22.791
She's new.

37:23.833 --> 37:25.375
But Ellie's one of us now.

37:26.541 --> 37:28.500
Aw, I love it.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.625
Look who it is.

37:46.666 --> 37:47.833
Are you stalking me?

37:47.916 --> 37:48.750
Yes.

37:49.458 --> 37:50.833
And later I was gonna murder you.

37:50.916 --> 37:51.875
Cute.

37:51.958 --> 37:52.916
I like your shirt.

37:54.041 --> 37:57.000
Did it come with a bag of granola
and a matching pair of Tevas?

37:57.083 --> 37:58.708
Wow. I didn't realize

37:58.791 --> 38:01.208
that you also did
the Peace Corps summer program.

38:01.291 --> 38:04.416
I should've guessed it because your vibe
is definitely all about helping others.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.166
Ooh. Solid burn.

38:08.458 --> 38:10.583
Are you catching
a lot of waves in Miami?

38:10.666 --> 38:12.458
It's, uh… it's actually Carissa's board.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.583
Oh. I didn't know she was over there.

38:16.666 --> 38:17.833
Hey, girl.

38:21.791 --> 38:22.708
She hates me.

38:22.791 --> 38:25.833
No. She thinks you
just don't actually care about the farm.

38:25.916 --> 38:26.750
What?

38:27.416 --> 38:30.208
How could she think that, Russ?
I love the farm.

38:30.291 --> 38:33.000
Okay? Those root veggies
are like my children now.

38:33.083 --> 38:34.166
Shit, um…

38:35.166 --> 38:38.083
-I ate some of your kids yesterday.
-No.

38:38.166 --> 38:39.583
But they were delicious.

38:39.666 --> 38:41.500
-Even the carrots?
-Every last one of them.

38:41.583 --> 38:43.750
How dare you? Heartbreaking.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.375
So nice seeing you outside the farm.

38:49.791 --> 38:50.708
Bye, Drea.

38:51.625 --> 38:53.875
<i>Our chemistry</i>
<i>was kind of incredible.</i>

38:53.958 --> 38:55.958
<i>Thank God I was sitting on a towel.</i>

38:56.041 --> 38:57.416
<i>But I had a job to do.</i>

39:00.166 --> 39:01.041
Hey.

39:05.708 --> 39:07.500
Bingo.

39:14.916 --> 39:17.208
-What are you doing here?
-Oh no.

39:20.083 --> 39:20.958
I live here.

39:21.583 --> 39:23.041
So, Max is…

39:23.666 --> 39:24.750
My brother.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.375
Unfortunately.

39:27.916 --> 39:30.083
You neglected to mention that
on your tour.

39:30.166 --> 39:31.875
Oh, I prefer "playfully omitted."

39:35.958 --> 39:39.708
Hmm. Three weeks at Rosehill,
and you got a whole new look now, huh?

39:39.791 --> 39:40.833
Yeah.

39:43.375 --> 39:44.416
You not a fan?

39:44.500 --> 39:45.833
No, I think it's hot.

39:47.250 --> 39:50.291
As long as you did it for you
and not them.

39:51.625 --> 39:52.708
Do I seem like that?

39:53.208 --> 39:54.166
I don't know.

39:55.333 --> 39:57.666
That's the exciting part
of getting to know someone.

39:59.333 --> 40:00.791
You're a mystery until you're not.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.750
Hmm. I was gonna hole up in
the screening room

40:04.833 --> 40:08.666
and catch a Godard flick
if you want to… ditch the suck-fest.

40:08.750 --> 40:09.583
Maybe?

40:10.666 --> 40:12.041
I do.

40:13.125 --> 40:15.083
But I… shouldn't.

40:16.291 --> 40:17.208
Suit yourself.

40:17.875 --> 40:20.583
Oh. The orgy usually starts
around sundown.

40:20.666 --> 40:21.750
Really?

40:21.833 --> 40:23.000
No.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.666
What? My brother is not that fun.

40:26.166 --> 40:29.500
Good to know you're down, though.
Enjoy the cool kids.

40:31.166 --> 40:32.125
Fuck.

40:36.250 --> 40:37.625
Nice view, Max.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.666
Oh my God.
He's hooking up with the Instagram witch.

41:16.625 --> 41:17.500
Hey.

41:18.333 --> 41:23.666
Do you think it's weird
how we're having this party without her?

41:25.333 --> 41:26.166
Who?

41:26.250 --> 41:28.041
Drea. What do you mean, "who"?

41:29.083 --> 41:29.958
No.

41:30.458 --> 41:34.791
-Hey. Max. Can we talk about it, please?

41:37.875 --> 41:39.416
Just feels weird, you know?

41:40.000 --> 41:43.458
To me, it feels weird
that you're talking about my ex right now.

41:43.541 --> 41:45.333
She was my best friend too.

41:45.416 --> 41:48.041
But we're about to have sex,
and you're talking about Drea.

41:48.875 --> 41:52.250
Feels, like… very weird.

41:53.916 --> 41:57.583
Well, we're not having sex.
You can go fuck yourself. Have fun.

42:01.750 --> 42:02.708
That's fine.

42:16.750 --> 42:17.625
Hello?

42:19.458 --> 42:20.333
Hello?

42:34.083 --> 42:35.750
-Eleanor.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.666
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:42.208 --> 42:43.166
Hi.

42:44.250 --> 42:45.125
Sorry.

42:46.958 --> 42:48.458
Were you watching us?

42:49.000 --> 42:51.541
No. Um, I was in here,

42:51.625 --> 42:53.750
and then you guys came in here,
so I went in there.

42:55.708 --> 42:57.125
I know what you were doing.

43:01.166 --> 43:03.333
I'd hide from my party too if I could.

43:05.000 --> 43:05.958
It's all right.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.875
Come on. I got a cool spot.

43:12.458 --> 43:13.500
You'll like this.

43:17.125 --> 43:19.208
Tell me something nobody knows about you.

43:19.291 --> 43:21.458
-Why would I do that?

43:22.291 --> 43:23.666
Because…

43:25.708 --> 43:26.708
I'm interesting,

43:28.041 --> 43:29.333
and you wanna impress me.

43:31.041 --> 43:32.958
You wanna know my deepest, darkest secret?

43:33.541 --> 43:34.458
Yes.

43:37.125 --> 43:38.625
I don't want any of this.

43:39.500 --> 43:42.541
I would love to backpack across Europe
with my camera.

43:43.666 --> 43:45.291
Just blow up my whole life.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.833
I would. 'Cause all this shit,
it's so performative.

43:51.583 --> 43:54.458
And for what? So I can be
the most popular guy in high school?

43:55.750 --> 43:58.000
Yikes.

44:00.666 --> 44:02.166
Then what do you wanna be?

44:03.833 --> 44:05.625
The real answer is I don't know.

44:07.750 --> 44:09.791
Which is about the worst answer
I could give.

44:10.791 --> 44:11.666
Yeah.

44:14.375 --> 44:15.375
But it's true.

44:16.458 --> 44:18.958
You're right. We're all just performing.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.250
This feels illegal.

44:48.833 --> 44:50.541
It's not illegal. We go here.

44:50.625 --> 44:51.583
On weekdays.

44:54.541 --> 44:55.458
Whoops.

44:56.666 --> 44:58.166
So, how was Max's party?

44:59.750 --> 45:01.666
You know what? It was actually really fun.

45:01.750 --> 45:04.166
They got this hilarious boomerang
of me jumping into the pool.

45:04.250 --> 45:06.791
Oh my God. A boomerang
of you jumping in the pool. Can I see it?

45:06.875 --> 45:07.791
Sure.

45:08.458 --> 45:11.750
You weren't there to bank social content.
You were there to get dirt on Max.

45:15.208 --> 45:18.583
Max is cheating on Tara with Allegra.
I saw his texts.

45:18.666 --> 45:19.583
The Instagram witch?

45:19.666 --> 45:20.583
Yeah.

45:21.166 --> 45:22.000
Oh my God.

45:22.583 --> 45:26.791
Eleanor, this is amazing.
Girl, you crushed it. Great work.

45:26.875 --> 45:28.708
Two seconds ago,
you threw my phone in the dirt.

45:28.791 --> 45:31.000
Yeah, and now I'm happy
with you again. Keep up.

45:31.083 --> 45:32.708
Wait. Did you get screenshots
of the texts?

45:32.791 --> 45:33.666
Not yet.

45:33.750 --> 45:34.583
Mad at you.

45:34.666 --> 45:37.625
Do you really think
Carissa's growing drugs?

45:37.708 --> 45:40.916
Because I want to get her,
but I don't want to send her to jail.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.166
First of all, Carissa's rich, white ass
is never going to jail.

45:44.250 --> 45:47.791
Second of all, the headmaster
would rather Rosehill burned to the ground

45:47.875 --> 45:51.625
than have a public drug scandal
on her hands. She is truly that bitch.

45:51.708 --> 45:55.125
I want her to hit me with her Tesla
and then reverse back over me.

45:55.208 --> 45:57.416
I want her to stuff me
like a taxidermy doll

45:57.500 --> 45:59.583
and then mount me on her wall
like a prize.

45:59.666 --> 46:01.500
I want her to hide my body in the woods

46:01.583 --> 46:03.833
and then start the search party
trying to find me.

46:03.916 --> 46:05.208
Ooh. Good one.

46:09.416 --> 46:12.500
Oh my fucking God.

46:12.583 --> 46:15.083
Carissa, you bad girl.

46:16.250 --> 46:18.708
So, um, what now?

46:19.333 --> 46:21.083
I think it's pretty obvious.

46:21.750 --> 46:24.500
We put these mushrooms
in whatever bougie foodie bullshit

46:24.583 --> 46:26.875
Carissa's cooking
for the senior class ring dinner,

46:26.958 --> 46:28.166
dosing the entire class

46:28.250 --> 46:30.208
and exposing her
for the fraud that she is.

46:30.291 --> 46:32.166
Then, while everyone's tripping balls,

46:32.250 --> 46:34.666
you steal Max's phone
and get us those texts.

46:36.041 --> 46:38.666
That was not obvious.

46:39.375 --> 46:40.500
Really?

46:46.708 --> 46:49.000
It's fine. I'm sure it's fine.
All right, guys…

46:49.083 --> 46:50.166
Smile!

46:50.750 --> 46:52.083
Eleanor!

46:56.916 --> 46:58.791
Let's take a picture!

47:00.625 --> 47:02.708
You better be smiling.

47:04.083 --> 47:05.625
We have an announcement

47:05.708 --> 47:09.875
from your senior class president,
Max Broussard.

47:09.958 --> 47:11.125
-Hey!

47:11.208 --> 47:12.708
We love you, Max!

47:14.041 --> 47:15.458
There we go!

47:16.833 --> 47:19.375
Thank you. Welcome. Welcome, seniors.

47:19.875 --> 47:22.125
You one handsome-looking son of a bitch,
Broussard!

47:22.208 --> 47:24.458
Elliot Tanners, ladies and gentlemen.

47:24.541 --> 47:25.541
Love you, buddy!

47:26.291 --> 47:27.166
More than friends.

47:27.250 --> 47:28.333
Now,

47:29.041 --> 47:30.750
when you wear these rings,

47:31.750 --> 47:34.583
I want you to remember
all the lessons that you learned here.

47:35.083 --> 47:37.541
I want you to remember
the friendships that you made,

47:38.833 --> 47:40.541
your memories of this place.

47:43.291 --> 47:48.000
When you wear these rings,
I want you to remember that you are,

47:48.875 --> 47:50.666
and you always will be…

47:53.083 --> 47:54.083
a Rosehill Tiger.

47:54.166 --> 47:57.333
-Let's go, Tigers!

47:57.416 --> 48:01.000
Hope you have a sick winter break.
Wonderful, wonderful holidays.

48:01.083 --> 48:03.500
Happy New Year's. But first,

48:04.916 --> 48:08.291
I'm gonna turn the stage over
to our resident Ina Garten.

48:09.916 --> 48:11.416
Carissa Jones, everyone.

48:18.041 --> 48:18.916
Hi, everyone.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.541
Uh, I am so honored
to have made this feast

48:22.625 --> 48:24.791
for you all tonight.
I really hope you enjoy it.

48:24.875 --> 48:29.208
And, uh, with that,
let me take you on a journey of umami.

48:29.291 --> 48:33.000
-Ooh.

48:33.083 --> 48:34.625
-Hey.
-Hey.

48:36.541 --> 48:37.500
You look great.

48:38.208 --> 48:39.375
Thanks.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.125
You, uh, clean up well yourself.

48:41.208 --> 48:42.958
Oh. I know.

48:43.750 --> 48:47.416
I am so proud of you.
This is gonna be the best night ever.

48:51.958 --> 48:54.333
-Who wants dessert?
-I'm ready for dessert.

49:01.833 --> 49:02.791
Hmm.

49:04.083 --> 49:05.375
Is everything okay?

49:05.458 --> 49:06.625
Yeah, no. I'm fine.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.958
-Uh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
-Mm-hmm.

49:22.583 --> 49:23.458
Eleanor?

49:25.083 --> 49:26.458
It's not working!

49:26.541 --> 49:30.458
It'll be fine, okay? Everyone devoured
their cassoulet. It's gonna work.

49:31.541 --> 49:32.666
Shit. Shit. Shit.

49:34.333 --> 49:36.458
Oh my God! Bitch, get up.

49:36.541 --> 49:39.458
What is wrong with you?
Get off the floor. It's so gross.

49:39.541 --> 49:41.333
Is anyone else feeling weird?

49:41.416 --> 49:44.375
I feel floaty.
I feel like a… like a little butterfly.

49:44.458 --> 49:47.041
Oh no.

49:47.125 --> 49:50.250
-Please!
-My pupils are fucking massive.

49:50.333 --> 49:52.333
-Please!
-My pupils are huge.

49:52.416 --> 49:53.708
Can someone open up, please?

49:53.791 --> 49:55.208
Uh, I'm sorry.

49:55.291 --> 49:57.458
Someone's in here.
I don't feel well either.

50:01.125 --> 50:03.083
Something's happening.

50:05.458 --> 50:06.625
Ew.

50:07.208 --> 50:09.083
Do you go to school with us?

50:09.166 --> 50:11.083
Oh my God. We're at school.

50:15.375 --> 50:17.583
Oh my God. Let's get in the water.

50:17.666 --> 50:18.791
Yeah!

50:34.916 --> 50:36.000
It's levitating!

50:40.541 --> 50:42.500
Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

50:42.583 --> 50:45.583
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

50:45.666 --> 50:47.541
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

50:59.791 --> 51:01.791
Russ, I think we've been drugged.

51:02.333 --> 51:04.208
-Nah.
-No, we vibin', 'Rissa.

51:04.291 --> 51:06.208
Why can't you just come get me?

51:06.291 --> 51:09.708
Mom, please just come get me!
I don't want to be here!

51:09.791 --> 51:14.083
No, no, no, they can't get Max.
They can't. Don't.

51:14.166 --> 51:16.500
-Max?
-No. You're a beautiful boy.

51:16.583 --> 51:17.541
Hey, Max.

51:17.625 --> 51:20.000
No. No, no, no.
Don't let in the spiders.

51:20.083 --> 51:22.583
Oh my God.
There are spiders all over your phone.

51:39.291 --> 51:42.083
-Hello there, my little tech whiz.

51:43.041 --> 51:46.333
I see you have Max's phone.
Is the download complete?

51:46.416 --> 51:48.166
It's processing, revenge mommy.

51:48.833 --> 51:50.500
Very good.

51:55.708 --> 51:56.625
There she is.

51:57.958 --> 51:59.250
My hero.

52:03.708 --> 52:08.500
Oh my God.
Is the headmaster going to the greenhouse?

52:09.916 --> 52:11.833
I anonymously tipped her off.

52:12.833 --> 52:14.916
It's called double assurance, sweetie.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.291
Look it up.

52:21.916 --> 52:23.583
Are you on mushrooms?

52:29.208 --> 52:30.291
Maybe.

52:31.416 --> 52:32.375
Are you?

52:33.875 --> 52:34.708
Yeah.

52:52.166 --> 52:53.583
One down.

52:55.083 --> 52:56.083
One to go.

53:00.291 --> 53:01.291
Do you feel amazing?

53:01.875 --> 53:02.916
Incredible.

53:04.208 --> 53:05.333
I know it's bad,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.791
but watching them
escort Carissa away was, like,

53:10.375 --> 53:12.041
one of the best moments of my life.

53:13.541 --> 53:15.833
Yeah, the Glennergy really leapt out.

53:20.000 --> 53:20.875
Thank you.

53:25.375 --> 53:26.541
Your house is, like…

53:26.625 --> 53:29.000
…really cozy.

53:29.083 --> 53:31.666
"Cozy" is just a nice way
of saying "small."

53:32.833 --> 53:34.666
No, I… I really didn't mean it like that.

53:34.750 --> 53:36.458
No, I know. I'm sorry.

53:37.291 --> 53:38.541
I know you didn't.

53:38.625 --> 53:40.333
I just used to be so afraid

53:40.416 --> 53:43.041
of Tara and them finding out
this is where I lived.

53:44.708 --> 53:47.583
Isn't that twisted?
They were my best friends.

53:47.666 --> 53:50.708
Yeah, but your instincts were right.

53:50.791 --> 53:51.666
I guess.

53:52.166 --> 53:55.666
Speaking of, I'm ready to see those texts.

53:55.750 --> 53:56.875
You sure?

53:58.208 --> 53:59.125
Okay.

54:00.625 --> 54:01.625
Let's go.

54:08.625 --> 54:10.541
All right. Come over here.

54:18.125 --> 54:21.291
Oh my God. He's cheating
with half the girls at Rosehill.

54:22.791 --> 54:25.791
There are messages here
from a girl in every clique.

54:27.208 --> 54:28.541
Goes back years.

54:33.583 --> 54:34.875
-Sorry.

54:36.541 --> 54:37.958
Are you okay?

54:38.041 --> 54:38.875
Yeah.

54:39.666 --> 54:41.125
Yeah. No, I mean…

54:42.875 --> 54:47.041
…Max is a lying garbage rat,
so no surprise he was a cheater too.

54:49.791 --> 54:54.541
If we expose those texts,
everyone will know he did this to you.

54:55.041 --> 54:56.416
Good. He'll look even worse.

54:57.250 --> 55:00.875
We should do it on Valentine's Day.
Really go for the drama.

55:13.916 --> 55:15.666
You know you don't have to be brave
with me.

55:17.875 --> 55:18.916
This sucks.

55:20.083 --> 55:21.333
It's allowed to suck.

55:29.625 --> 55:30.500
Yeah.

55:32.666 --> 55:33.916
Fine.

55:37.333 --> 55:38.250
It sucks.

55:42.208 --> 55:43.541
It really sucks.

55:52.333 --> 55:54.166
Do you think I'll feel better?

55:56.041 --> 55:57.041
What do you mean?

55:58.333 --> 56:00.666
I'm just so angry all the time.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.375
There's this knot in my chest…

56:10.458 --> 56:15.250
and the Max stuff made it worse,
but… it's always been there.

56:17.875 --> 56:20.958
And every day,
I feel it getting tighter and stronger.

56:23.250 --> 56:25.541
And I feel like it's choking me.

56:27.958 --> 56:31.000
Sometimes it just hurts to exist,
you know?

56:33.750 --> 56:35.958
I just wanna feel normal again.

56:37.250 --> 56:38.083
Yeah.

56:39.375 --> 56:41.083
I know exactly what you mean.

56:44.666 --> 56:45.541
Come here.

56:59.833 --> 57:02.250
I like you, Eleanor.

57:04.750 --> 57:06.125
You're just like me.

57:09.833 --> 57:10.791
Yeah.

57:12.208 --> 57:13.083
I am.

57:21.791 --> 57:22.666
<i>Move.</i>

57:23.875 --> 57:24.750
<i>Further.</i>

57:25.416 --> 57:26.250
<i>Further.</i>

57:27.333 --> 57:29.083
<i>-Thank you.</i>
-<i>Okay, ready?</i>

57:29.166 --> 57:30.125
<i>Go, go.</i>

57:32.916 --> 57:36.916
<i>Good morning, Rosehill students.</i>

57:37.000 --> 57:38.541
<i>Love is certainly in the air</i>

57:38.625 --> 57:40.833
<i>with Valentine's Day</i>
<i>right around the corner.</i>

57:40.916 --> 57:43.750
<i>Today, I'm joined by Meghan Perez,</i>

57:43.833 --> 57:48.416
<i>two-time National Scholastic</i>
<i>Press Association Award winner</i>

57:48.500 --> 57:50.333
<i>and editor of </i>The Thorn.

57:50.416 --> 57:53.208
<i>Thank you so much, Meghan,</i>
<i>for joining us today.</i>

57:53.291 --> 57:55.041
<i>The pleasure is all mine, Tara.</i>

57:56.375 --> 57:59.750
<i>I am so happy we get to talk</i>
<i>about the profile you're running</i>

57:59.833 --> 58:00.916
<i>in today's </i>Thorn.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.041
<i>Last year's public assault sent</i>
<i>a shockwave through the campus.</i>

58:04.125 --> 58:08.416
<i>And as a journalist, it felt like</i>
<i>such a ripe space for closer exploration.</i>

58:08.500 --> 58:13.708
<i>When I approached Max about this piece,</i>
<i>I wasn't sure how he would feel about it.</i>

58:13.791 --> 58:16.875
<i>But he was so game</i>
<i>to get his side of the story out there.</i>

58:17.458 --> 58:20.125
<i>I am constantly blown away</i>
<i>by his strength.</i>

58:20.208 --> 58:23.208
<i>I know.</i>
<i>He was so vulnerable, so honest.</i>

58:23.291 --> 58:26.583
<i>Well, I can't wait for everyone</i>
<i>to read this thought-provoking piece.</i>

58:33.375 --> 58:34.791
Hey. Hey, hey.

58:36.875 --> 58:37.875
What's up?

58:38.625 --> 58:39.541
You okay?

58:41.541 --> 58:43.166
No, not really.

58:43.666 --> 58:46.375
Uh, look, I'm having
a pretty shit morning myself,

58:46.458 --> 58:48.833
and I was contemplating ditching.

58:49.750 --> 58:51.583
Would be a lot more fun if I had a mate.

58:53.500 --> 58:54.541
A mate?

58:54.625 --> 58:57.000
Yeah. Was gonna go for a joyride.

59:02.583 --> 59:03.416
Let's roll.

59:23.083 --> 59:24.916
What?

59:25.708 --> 59:26.541
Russ.

59:27.375 --> 59:28.625
What is this place?

59:29.208 --> 59:31.625
My dad bought this warehouse
a couple of years ago

59:31.708 --> 59:34.875
and then decided he didn't want it,
so he just left it with me.

59:36.583 --> 59:40.458
Wait. So, this entire warehouse
belongs to you?

59:41.666 --> 59:43.291
It's an artist collective.

59:43.375 --> 59:44.291
Artist?

59:45.958 --> 59:47.291
I didn't know you were an artist.

59:47.375 --> 59:51.708
Sure, well, you don't tend to ask
many people questions about themselves.

59:51.791 --> 59:52.875
Okay, rude.

59:54.666 --> 59:55.916
But fair.

1:00:05.333 --> 1:00:08.000
So, what are we doing here?

1:00:09.041 --> 1:00:13.208
So a couple of years ago,
when my parents were getting divorced,

1:00:13.291 --> 1:00:17.291
I… felt like I was caught
in between the whole thing,

1:00:17.375 --> 1:00:20.250
and… I was just really angry.

1:00:20.333 --> 1:00:24.750
But I found that throwing paint
at these canvases

1:00:24.833 --> 1:00:26.750
really helped me channel my rage.

1:00:27.250 --> 1:00:30.958
I've been coming here a lot
since… Carissa got expelled.

1:00:31.041 --> 1:00:33.208
It's been really tough for me without her.

1:00:33.291 --> 1:00:37.208
And I thought,
with everything you've been through,

1:00:37.291 --> 1:00:38.625
maybe it could help you too.

1:00:38.708 --> 1:00:40.958
I know this year hasn't been easy
for you either.

1:00:48.541 --> 1:00:49.375
Oh, you're dead.

1:00:51.291 --> 1:00:53.708
-Oh! Murder you!
-No, no, no.

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.125
Russ!

1:01:08.875 --> 1:01:10.666
Okay, okay. Let's make…

1:02:00.750 --> 1:02:02.166
How're you feeling?

1:02:02.250 --> 1:02:04.041
Much better. Thank you.

1:02:04.750 --> 1:02:07.458
High school is stupid,
and I look forward to being done with it.

1:02:07.541 --> 1:02:09.625
Yeah, I feel you.

1:02:10.583 --> 1:02:13.125
So, what are your plans?

1:02:14.208 --> 1:02:15.916
Yale then Harvard Law.

1:02:18.250 --> 1:02:19.541
That's a rough combo.

1:02:20.166 --> 1:02:21.500
Oh, so you're a socialist?

1:02:21.583 --> 1:02:23.791
All I'm saying is, don't equate your worth

1:02:23.875 --> 1:02:26.041
to some archaic idea
of what the best means.

1:02:27.375 --> 1:02:31.916
Hey, um, can I say something
that might make you very uncomfortable?

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:34.833
I guess you have to now.

1:02:37.416 --> 1:02:38.958
I just want to say I'm sorry.

1:02:39.833 --> 1:02:41.416
About what happened with Max.

1:02:43.041 --> 1:02:43.916
Thank you.

1:02:46.625 --> 1:02:48.041
It really means a lot.

1:02:57.416 --> 1:02:58.541
You good?

1:02:59.125 --> 1:03:00.041
Yeah.

1:03:07.416 --> 1:03:10.666
And now,
the founder of the Cis Hetero Men

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:15.375
Championing Female-Identifying Students
League, Max Broussard.

1:03:25.333 --> 1:03:26.958
Thank you. Thank you.

1:03:27.041 --> 1:03:28.416
-Love you!
-Yeah, baby.

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:29.500
Thank you, guys.

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:36.041
So, we in the League, we've been trying
to put our heads together

1:03:36.125 --> 1:03:38.750
to figure out a way
to show all of you ladies at the school

1:03:39.458 --> 1:03:40.625
how much you mean to us

1:03:40.708 --> 1:03:43.333
and, more importantly,
how much we respect you.

1:03:44.333 --> 1:03:46.791
Come on. Let's give it
for respecting women!

1:03:48.791 --> 1:03:50.458
Sorry.

1:03:51.291 --> 1:03:56.500
Now, as we all know,
Valentine's Day is inherently patriarchal.

1:03:56.583 --> 1:04:01.458
It is heteronormative,
and, honestly, it's kind of isolating,

1:04:01.541 --> 1:04:04.458
because you shouldn't have to have
a special someone in your life

1:04:04.541 --> 1:04:05.375
to feel included.

1:04:05.458 --> 1:04:09.791
In fact, the most special someone
in your life is you.

1:04:09.875 --> 1:04:10.916
Aw.

1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.166
-Gag me!
-So…

1:04:12.958 --> 1:04:14.208
We thought,

1:04:14.916 --> 1:04:20.666
"Why not take back this day
and make it all about loving ourselves?"

1:04:21.750 --> 1:04:24.666
-And… and, uh…

1:04:24.750 --> 1:04:26.000
So, we have…

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.333
-And, uh…

1:04:30.416 --> 1:04:31.875
Oh my God, his texts!

1:04:31.958 --> 1:04:33.208
Are you kidding me?

1:04:33.291 --> 1:04:34.458
What's going on?

1:04:34.541 --> 1:04:35.833
You're terrible.

1:04:37.583 --> 1:04:38.875
Did you see this?

1:04:39.375 --> 1:04:42.458
I'm shocked! This is shocking news!

1:04:45.708 --> 1:04:46.583
What's going on?

1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:50.166
What an asshole, right?

1:04:50.250 --> 1:04:51.333
Oh my God.

1:04:53.166 --> 1:04:54.375
Oh my God. Cover me.

1:04:54.458 --> 1:04:56.208
Shocking! I'm shocked!

1:04:56.291 --> 1:04:57.500
Cover me now.

1:04:57.583 --> 1:04:59.333
Feminist, my ass, you know?

1:04:59.916 --> 1:05:01.041
-Higher.
-Let's go.

1:05:01.125 --> 1:05:01.958
Higher.

1:05:04.250 --> 1:05:05.708
It's gonna be okay.

1:05:06.333 --> 1:05:08.375
Cover me. Go! Go faster!

1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:17.750
We're casting spells tonight, bitches.

1:05:17.833 --> 1:05:20.791
Here's what I heard went down.
One of his side pieces blasted him.

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:23.750
She found out he wasn't just keeping
her a secret. Mm-mm.

1:05:23.833 --> 1:05:25.500
He's banging a girl in every clique.

1:05:25.583 --> 1:05:27.250
Guess Max's allyship was an act.

1:05:27.333 --> 1:05:28.333
Ban men!

1:05:28.416 --> 1:05:29.708
Hey, rip 'em up, ladies.

1:05:29.791 --> 1:05:31.375
Get out of the way!

1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:46.333
No, we're in the library.

1:05:46.416 --> 1:05:48.500
This is bad for us both.
How do we spin this?

1:05:48.583 --> 1:05:50.958
No, no, no, no.
Max is in his safe space. Yeah.

1:05:51.041 --> 1:05:52.541
Please make this go away.

1:05:52.625 --> 1:05:54.458
Baby,
I'm on with my dad's strategist.

1:05:54.541 --> 1:05:56.833
Maximus, you okay?

1:05:56.916 --> 1:05:58.375
Fix it, please.

1:05:59.125 --> 1:06:02.916
Oh my God. Yes, that's genius.
Thank you so much.

1:06:03.583 --> 1:06:05.625
Okay, guys, here's the plan.

1:06:05.708 --> 1:06:08.208
Tara and Max are ethically nonmonogamous.

1:06:09.208 --> 1:06:10.125
They're poly.

1:06:10.625 --> 1:06:14.041
Honestly, y'all, it's kind of wack
to bind yourself to some old-school ideas

1:06:14.125 --> 1:06:16.625
of what we think
relationships should look like.

1:06:16.708 --> 1:06:18.958
Y'all, we're young. We're fluid.

1:06:19.041 --> 1:06:22.083
-We should be out there eating ass, dawg.
-Yeah.

1:06:22.166 --> 1:06:24.083
It's actually super progressive of them

1:06:24.166 --> 1:06:26.500
to transcend heteronormative structures,
you know?

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:29.000
This is America.
We finna eat any ass we want, y'all.

1:06:29.083 --> 1:06:31.000
Get in there and eat that ass
is what I'm saying.

1:06:31.083 --> 1:06:35.333
Also, if they're open, then that means…

1:06:36.208 --> 1:06:38.458
…I have a shot with Max!

1:06:38.541 --> 1:06:40.791
-I have a shot with Max!
-I have a shot with Max?

1:06:40.875 --> 1:06:42.083
I have a shot with Max.

1:06:42.166 --> 1:06:43.541
I have a shot with Max.

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:45.208
Bitch.

1:06:45.291 --> 1:06:46.708
I have a shot with Max!

1:06:49.708 --> 1:06:51.750
He's actually more progressive
than I thought.

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:53.750
I never doubted him,
not for a second.

1:06:54.916 --> 1:06:55.916
Drea.

1:06:56.583 --> 1:06:59.000
The headmaster wants to see you
in her office.

1:07:00.708 --> 1:07:02.541
Okay, I'll be right there.

1:07:06.541 --> 1:07:08.666
-Fuck.

1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:26.333
It's been
quite an interesting day.

1:07:27.958 --> 1:07:31.208
You know, I pride myself
on having this uncanny ability

1:07:31.291 --> 1:07:33.583
to spot and nurture talent.

1:07:34.250 --> 1:07:39.041
Well, maybe not directly nurture,
but you know, I can see it,

1:07:39.875 --> 1:07:41.791
and then I delegate the nurturing.

1:07:42.958 --> 1:07:47.458
When I read your application essay,
I thought, "This girl is the future."

1:07:48.583 --> 1:07:50.000
"This girl is special."

1:07:52.041 --> 1:07:53.208
I hate being wrong.

1:07:54.666 --> 1:07:55.750
You weren't wrong.

1:08:00.125 --> 1:08:03.625
I only trim my bonsai
when I'm especially vexed.

1:08:04.875 --> 1:08:07.083
Poor thing has seen
a lot of action this year

1:08:07.166 --> 1:08:09.166
due, in large part, to you.

1:08:10.250 --> 1:08:11.791
She's gonna be bald soon.

1:08:13.666 --> 1:08:16.750
I just got off a rather distressing call
with Jessica Cron,

1:08:16.833 --> 1:08:18.166
head of admissions for Yale.

1:08:18.250 --> 1:08:19.750
Oh, this is about Yale?

1:08:20.833 --> 1:08:22.208
What else would it be about?

1:08:23.083 --> 1:08:24.458
Nothing. I…

1:08:26.291 --> 1:08:27.166
Wait.

1:08:29.458 --> 1:08:30.625
Did Yale reject me?

1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:32.916
I tried to turn her.

1:08:33.791 --> 1:08:37.833
But your grades have slipped,
your extracurricular is nonexistent,

1:08:37.916 --> 1:08:40.166
and the icing on this unsavory cake,

1:08:40.250 --> 1:08:43.875
someone sent her the <i>Thorn </i>piece
detailing your assault on Mr. Broussard.

1:08:44.458 --> 1:08:45.708
It's quite the trifecta.

1:08:45.791 --> 1:08:48.708
No, no, no.
It's not even April yet. Like, I…

1:08:49.666 --> 1:08:53.416
I can turn this around. I just…
This year is… I've been distracted--

1:08:53.500 --> 1:08:57.041
Whatever you've been distracted with,
I hope it's worth your future.

1:08:57.541 --> 1:08:59.000
Because that's what it cost you.

1:09:02.125 --> 1:09:03.375
Can I please be excused?

1:09:03.458 --> 1:09:04.708
Yup.

1:09:09.125 --> 1:09:11.500
<i>I felt violated all over again.</i>

1:09:12.208 --> 1:09:15.875
<i>There was only one person sadistic enough</i>
<i>to send that article.</i>

1:09:16.375 --> 1:09:19.583
<i>It was clear.</i>
<i>Max was hunting me for sport.</i>

1:09:21.541 --> 1:09:24.833
<i>Yale was the only thing keeping me</i>
<i>from going for his throat,</i>

1:09:24.916 --> 1:09:26.541
<i>but it was open season now.</i>

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.916
<i>I had nothing holding me back,</i>

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.541
<i>and I was prepared</i>
<i>to burn it all to the ground.</i>

1:09:40.333 --> 1:09:42.791
Oh my God.
I'm so sorry. We can try again.

1:09:42.875 --> 1:09:43.958
Yale rejected me.

1:09:45.833 --> 1:09:48.708
-No, no, no. Don't do that. Don't pity me.

1:09:48.791 --> 1:09:50.458
And definitely don't touch me.

1:09:51.458 --> 1:09:52.916
-God.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.791
It's not just Max. It's all of them,

1:09:54.875 --> 1:09:57.458
Tara, Meghan, Montana, Elliot.

1:09:57.541 --> 1:10:00.500
Every one of those trust-fund fucks
who I used to be friends with,

1:10:00.583 --> 1:10:03.666
they just stood by
while Max ruined my life.

1:10:03.750 --> 1:10:05.625
I've lost everything, Eleanor.

1:10:06.750 --> 1:10:07.958
Fucking everything!

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.750
What are you saying?
You want to go after all of them?

1:10:15.208 --> 1:10:17.208
Yes.

1:10:17.708 --> 1:10:19.875
Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.

1:10:20.541 --> 1:10:23.250
They need to feel the consequences
of what they did to me.

1:10:23.333 --> 1:10:25.416
Taking away my social status,
that's one thing.

1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:26.875
But taking away Yale?

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.500
Oh. They have to pay.

1:10:32.041 --> 1:10:34.875
All of them.

1:10:34.958 --> 1:10:36.333
-Fuck.
-So, um…

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.291
What do you wanna do?

1:10:40.125 --> 1:10:42.375
Please tell me
you got into at least one Ivy.

1:10:44.583 --> 1:10:46.541
Brown and Columbia, bitches.

1:10:47.125 --> 1:10:48.000
Should we tell her?

1:10:48.083 --> 1:10:48.916
Tell me what?

1:10:49.750 --> 1:10:51.875
Every year, there's this epic party.

1:10:51.958 --> 1:10:53.375
It's called the Admissions Party.

1:10:53.458 --> 1:10:55.125
A night of pure debauchery.

1:10:55.208 --> 1:10:57.291
No social media. No phones.

1:10:57.375 --> 1:11:01.000
Cell phones are surrendered
at the entrance from sundown to sunup.

1:11:01.083 --> 1:11:03.333
It's all-out madness.

1:11:03.416 --> 1:11:05.041
It's a Rosehill senior tradition.

1:11:05.125 --> 1:11:08.875
And the only way in
is your Ivy acceptance letter.

1:11:08.958 --> 1:11:12.625
You're going to expose
each one of those duplicitous assholes

1:11:13.125 --> 1:11:14.666
and destroy their futures.

1:11:14.750 --> 1:11:16.666
-What about Max?

1:11:19.458 --> 1:11:22.166
-We're gonna kill him.

1:11:22.250 --> 1:11:23.125
You're not serious?

1:11:23.708 --> 1:11:25.416
-No, I'm not fucking serious.

1:11:26.333 --> 1:11:27.458
But Max is mine.

1:11:28.083 --> 1:11:30.291
I'm gonna get him
to admit once and for all

1:11:30.375 --> 1:11:31.833
that he leaked that video.

1:11:31.916 --> 1:11:34.041
Something he can't spin his way out of.

1:11:35.250 --> 1:11:37.291
What do you say, pal? Hmm?

1:11:37.791 --> 1:11:39.041
Ready to take them down?

1:11:40.791 --> 1:11:41.625
I'm in.

1:11:43.375 --> 1:11:46.000
<i>Spoiler alert, Drea snapped.</i>

1:11:46.625 --> 1:11:50.166
<i>When she lost Yale,</i>
<i>a dark cloud settled over our friendship.</i>

1:11:50.666 --> 1:11:54.000
<i>She only cared about one thing, revenge.</i>

1:11:56.958 --> 1:11:58.416
-Where's the party happening?

1:11:58.500 --> 1:11:59.625
Max rented a house.

1:11:59.708 --> 1:12:01.250
-I don't have the address yet.
-Bro.

1:12:01.333 --> 1:12:04.375
My birthday is tomorrow.
Do you wanna maybe do something together?

1:12:04.458 --> 1:12:06.000
Yeah, sure. Get the address.

1:12:10.416 --> 1:12:12.541
I'm really glad you were down to hang.

1:12:13.208 --> 1:12:16.416
-You have quite the social calendar.
-Yeah, it's been a weird year.

1:12:20.333 --> 1:12:22.750
Hey, are you okay? What's going on?

1:12:22.833 --> 1:12:25.750
I feel like I'm being eaten alive
from the inside, actually.

1:12:27.833 --> 1:12:31.208
You ever look around
and just think, "How did I get here?"

1:12:31.791 --> 1:12:33.583
Yeah. All the time.

1:12:34.166 --> 1:12:36.208
You run with
a pretty intense crowd these days.

1:12:36.291 --> 1:12:39.000
It's as surprising to me
as it is to you.

1:12:40.458 --> 1:12:42.958
You've also had
quite the change this year.

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.166
-The new fits, blond hair.
-Hmm.

1:12:47.625 --> 1:12:49.375
It's rad. Don't get me wrong.

1:12:50.375 --> 1:12:53.458
But I'm still here for the Eleanor
I met on the first day of school.

1:12:54.708 --> 1:12:56.541
I think she's really something.

1:12:56.625 --> 1:13:00.125
I'm sorry. The old Eleanor
can't come to the phone right now.

1:13:00.208 --> 1:13:01.041
Why?

1:13:01.583 --> 1:13:04.125
<i>-'Cause she's dead.
</i>

1:13:06.458 --> 1:13:09.708
Nah, but all this shit, it's just armor.

1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:11.541
You know?

1:13:11.625 --> 1:13:15.291
Like, here, mine is seeming
incredibly secure of myself,

1:13:15.375 --> 1:13:18.083
when, in reality,
my whole I-don't-give-a-shit thing

1:13:18.166 --> 1:13:21.291
is just a front so no one can tell
I actually care so much.

1:13:21.375 --> 1:13:22.375
Seriously.

1:13:24.750 --> 1:13:25.875
I really like you.

1:13:30.791 --> 1:13:32.458
I wanna tell you everything.

1:13:35.666 --> 1:13:37.000
I really like you too.

1:13:55.291 --> 1:13:57.041
-Shh.

1:14:00.958 --> 1:14:02.875
-Drea?

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.416
Is there someone there?

1:14:16.708 --> 1:14:19.125
Surprise!

1:14:19.208 --> 1:14:21.791
-Oh my fucking God!
-Hey!

1:14:21.875 --> 1:14:23.958
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

1:14:24.041 --> 1:14:25.625
-You scared me.
-You all right?

1:14:25.708 --> 1:14:27.583
-You gonna shank us?
-Oh no. I wouldn't--

1:14:27.666 --> 1:14:29.041
This is my birthday party?

1:14:29.125 --> 1:14:30.125
Happy birthday.

1:14:30.208 --> 1:14:32.083
-Here you go.
-I can't believe you did this.

1:14:32.166 --> 1:14:34.833
-You did this for me?
-Of course. You're our friend.

1:14:35.625 --> 1:14:37.416
<i>In a shocking twist of events,</i>

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:41.375
<i>it turns out everything I thought I hated</i>
<i>was exactly what I always wanted.</i>

1:14:41.458 --> 1:14:44.333
<i>Sure, this started as me infiltrating</i>
<i>Max's group to help Drea.</i>

1:14:44.416 --> 1:14:47.416
<i>But at this moment, I just felt like</i>
<i>I was surrounded by my friends,</i>

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:51.500
<i>and all it took to get them</i>
<i>was me trying to ruin their lives.</i>

1:14:52.166 --> 1:14:54.458
-Oh! Okay.
-Show what you got. Pose it up!

1:14:54.541 --> 1:14:56.583
-Yeah!
-Come on.

1:15:00.083 --> 1:15:02.750
<i>Eleanor was really pissing me off.</i>

1:15:02.833 --> 1:15:05.916
<i>We made this plan.</i>
<i>I helped her get what she wanted,</i>

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.583
<i>and now when it was my turn,</i>
<i>she ghosted me?</i>

1:15:09.375 --> 1:15:11.666
-What's going on in that head of yours?
-Hmm?

1:15:11.750 --> 1:15:13.041
-Hmm?
-Nothing.

1:15:13.666 --> 1:15:14.666
Come here.

1:15:16.875 --> 1:15:20.291
I just need a little distraction
from all the stress.

1:15:21.916 --> 1:15:22.791
Okay.

1:15:23.666 --> 1:15:24.625
I can do that.

1:15:34.166 --> 1:15:35.291
Fuck.

1:15:36.083 --> 1:15:37.666
So good.

1:15:43.458 --> 1:15:47.125
<i>It's the birthday girl.</i>
<i>We all having a good time.</i>

1:15:50.208 --> 1:15:53.000
-I came. Let's go to a party.

1:15:53.083 --> 1:15:56.291
Never have I ever had a threesome.

1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:02.000
Happy birthday, Eleanor.

1:16:02.083 --> 1:16:04.458
Drea's here.

1:16:06.791 --> 1:16:07.791
Oh my God.

1:16:08.750 --> 1:16:11.000
What is she doing here?

1:16:11.083 --> 1:16:12.750
I didn't know you knew Drea.

1:16:12.833 --> 1:16:14.666
We have a couple classes together.

1:16:21.916 --> 1:16:23.583
-What are you doing here?
-What do you mean?

1:16:23.666 --> 1:16:26.500
I saw the party on Montana's Story.
She still has me on Close Friends.

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:29.208
Well, I'm sure that's by mistake.

1:16:29.291 --> 1:16:33.166
So hostile.
I'm waving the white flag, Max.

1:16:33.250 --> 1:16:36.208
Look, can't we just put
all this ugliness aside?

1:16:36.291 --> 1:16:38.208
I mean, you said
you didn't leak the video,

1:16:38.291 --> 1:16:42.250
and I believe it.
So, why are we still fighting, right?

1:16:44.625 --> 1:16:45.500
Yeah.

1:16:46.666 --> 1:16:48.333
-Yeah, you're right.
-Great.

1:16:48.416 --> 1:16:50.750
I'm glad you're here, Dre.
Have a good time.

1:16:51.791 --> 1:16:52.916
Max.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:54.875
Russ.

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:57.875
Hmm.

1:16:59.375 --> 1:17:00.500
Okay.

1:17:02.625 --> 1:17:05.083
Ooh. Such a fun vibe.

1:17:05.166 --> 1:17:08.083
Um, can I just steal the birthday girl
for a sec?

1:17:08.166 --> 1:17:09.833
-Mm-hmm.
-Your house is so cute.

1:17:09.916 --> 1:17:13.125
Come on. Show me around.
I feel like I don't even know you.

1:17:17.416 --> 1:17:20.083
Well, I think you handled that very well.

1:17:21.083 --> 1:17:23.250
How does she even have this address?

1:17:25.291 --> 1:17:26.250
Good question.

1:17:26.833 --> 1:17:27.666
Nice entrance.

1:17:28.875 --> 1:17:30.500
Yeah? Nice jacket.

1:17:30.583 --> 1:17:31.416
It was a gift.

1:17:32.166 --> 1:17:34.583
I can't believe you.
What do you think you're doing?

1:17:34.666 --> 1:17:36.000
You don't answer my texts.

1:17:36.083 --> 1:17:39.791
What do you think you're doing?
You come to my house. Are you okay?

1:17:39.875 --> 1:17:41.166
Are you?

1:17:41.250 --> 1:17:43.541
Because it's you
I'm worried about, Eleanor.

1:17:43.625 --> 1:17:46.958
Those people do not care
about you. They're not your friends.

1:17:47.041 --> 1:17:50.375
Oh, is that what this is about?
You're jealous I'm with your old friends?

1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:53.791
Did you even remember
that it was my birthday?

1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:00.166
No. Okay? I didn't.
But, fuck, why would I know that?

1:18:00.250 --> 1:18:03.458
Because I told you yesterday.
Because we spent an entire year together.

1:18:03.541 --> 1:18:07.125
Oh my God, you're pathetic.
Can't you see what he's doing?

1:18:07.208 --> 1:18:11.708
None of this is real.
This party? He's controlling you, dude.

1:18:12.541 --> 1:18:16.333
Every person in there will drop you
the minute you do not serve them anymore.

1:18:16.416 --> 1:18:17.750
Are you any different?

1:18:18.625 --> 1:18:20.958
At least with Max,
I got a birthday party out of it.

1:18:22.750 --> 1:18:26.041
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't like him, do you?

1:18:26.125 --> 1:18:28.708
Because he leaked that video, Eleanor.

1:18:28.791 --> 1:18:30.625
He leaked that video.

1:18:31.125 --> 1:18:32.291
Are you sure?

1:18:34.333 --> 1:18:36.041
There's never been any evidence.

1:18:40.500 --> 1:18:41.416
Take that back.

1:18:44.375 --> 1:18:45.208
No.

1:18:50.208 --> 1:18:52.625
I mean this from the bottom of my heart.

1:18:55.250 --> 1:18:57.208
Fuck you, Eleanor!

1:18:57.291 --> 1:18:58.625
Go home, Drea.

1:19:10.750 --> 1:19:11.791
Gabbi.

1:19:13.041 --> 1:19:14.291
Did you overhear that?

1:19:15.166 --> 1:19:16.333
I'm sorry. Drea is--

1:19:16.416 --> 1:19:17.500
Yeah, I know Drea.

1:19:17.583 --> 1:19:18.541
And…

1:19:19.583 --> 1:19:20.583
I love my brother.

1:19:20.666 --> 1:19:23.333
But… you know he leaked that video.

1:19:23.916 --> 1:19:26.041
You said some pretty messed-up stuff
out there.

1:19:26.625 --> 1:19:28.083
It's complicated.

1:19:29.416 --> 1:19:32.625
Hey, I guess we solved the mystery
of Eleanor, though, right?

1:19:34.333 --> 1:19:36.666
This isn't your armor anymore.
It's just you.

1:19:38.625 --> 1:19:40.625
Fuck, I can't believe I was wrong.

1:19:42.250 --> 1:19:44.875
Happy birthday, though.
I'll see you around.

1:19:57.458 --> 1:19:59.583
-<i>Paul's Auto.</i>

1:19:59.666 --> 1:20:03.125
Hi. Oh my God.
I'm so happy you're still open.

1:20:03.208 --> 1:20:08.000
Um, this is Drea Torres. You fixed
my teal Mitsubishi earlier this year.

1:20:08.500 --> 1:20:11.833
I'm late to pick up my mom from work,
and my car is not starting up,

1:20:11.916 --> 1:20:13.916
and I'm worried it's the same issue.

1:20:14.416 --> 1:20:17.166
<i>Yeah, last time,</i>
<i>someone removed your spark plug.</i>

1:20:17.250 --> 1:20:18.708
<i>That's why it wouldn't start.</i>

1:20:19.666 --> 1:20:20.541
Wait. What?

1:20:21.458 --> 1:20:24.083
Why would someone do that?
Are they worth something?

1:20:24.166 --> 1:20:27.583
<i>They're worth about 20 bucks.</i>
<i>Someone was probably messing with you.</i>

1:20:28.083 --> 1:20:31.375
<i>You got a jealous ex-boyfriend</i>
<i>who can fix cars? </i>

1:20:36.583 --> 1:20:37.791
Something like that.

1:20:39.208 --> 1:20:41.541
<i>There was only one way</i>
<i>to get to the bottom of this.</i>

1:20:41.625 --> 1:20:44.375
<i>I needed information</i>
<i>only one girl would have.</i>

1:20:44.958 --> 1:20:46.500
<i>And it wasn't Erica Norman,</i>

1:20:46.583 --> 1:20:49.458
<i>the girl I </i>allegedly<i> framed</i>
<i>at tennis camp.</i>

1:20:49.541 --> 1:20:51.208
<i>This was just a fun surprise.</i>

1:20:51.291 --> 1:20:52.250
Drea.

1:20:53.833 --> 1:20:55.458
<i>I hate surprises.</i>

1:20:56.250 --> 1:20:57.333
Erica.

1:20:57.416 --> 1:20:58.916
Wow, hi.

1:20:59.875 --> 1:21:01.625
How are you, girl?

1:21:02.208 --> 1:21:05.833
You know,
got kicked out of tennis camp.

1:21:05.916 --> 1:21:06.750
Yeah.

1:21:06.833 --> 1:21:11.583
Lost my scholarship to Stanford,
and I developed an actual coke problem.

1:21:11.666 --> 1:21:13.375
Oh no.

1:21:13.875 --> 1:21:16.875
-So what are you doing here?
-I came to see a friend.

1:21:16.958 --> 1:21:21.250
You know, I'm really glad
that I get to see you,

1:21:21.333 --> 1:21:22.875
'cause…

1:21:23.791 --> 1:21:26.375
…one of the steps in my recovery program

1:21:26.458 --> 1:21:29.750
is to make amends
with the people who I've hurt.

1:21:29.833 --> 1:21:31.833
So…

1:21:31.916 --> 1:21:34.083
…Drea…

1:21:35.041 --> 1:21:35.875
Yeah.

1:21:36.625 --> 1:21:37.458
Okay.

1:21:37.541 --> 1:21:39.208
Drea, Drea, Drea.

1:21:39.291 --> 1:21:40.125
Yep.

1:21:40.916 --> 1:21:42.708
From the bottom of my heart…

1:21:44.916 --> 1:21:46.500
I wish you nothing

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.166
but the worst

1:21:49.125 --> 1:21:52.666
for the rest
of your miserable fucking existence.

1:21:53.375 --> 1:21:54.583
And…

1:21:56.708 --> 1:21:59.458
I love your ear balls.

1:22:01.375 --> 1:22:02.375
I love them.

1:22:05.250 --> 1:22:07.583
-Thank you.

1:22:07.666 --> 1:22:10.000
She's waiting for you on the lower level.

1:22:11.541 --> 1:22:12.666
Great.

1:22:14.083 --> 1:22:15.458
Erica…

1:22:16.500 --> 1:22:18.416
So good to see you.

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.208
-Hmm.
-Hang in there, okay?

1:22:25.458 --> 1:22:27.500
Sleep with one eye open, bitch.

1:22:27.583 --> 1:22:30.916
-Erica, return to craft time.
-I'm fucking coming!

1:22:41.750 --> 1:22:42.666
Drea.

1:22:43.333 --> 1:22:45.583
I wanna talk to you about Eleanor Levetan.

1:23:04.958 --> 1:23:08.083
She's been ignoring me all year.
I almost didn't recognize her.

1:23:08.666 --> 1:23:10.458
She certainly remembers you.

1:23:10.541 --> 1:23:12.666
It's kind of hard
to forget your first crush.

1:23:12.750 --> 1:23:16.208
She was sort of my first girlfriend
back when she went by Nora.

1:23:16.791 --> 1:23:17.791
Nora?

1:23:17.875 --> 1:23:19.208
Yeah, Nora.

1:23:19.791 --> 1:23:21.666
She had the nose job and the name change,

1:23:21.750 --> 1:23:24.000
but hey, I think
they're both working for her.

1:23:24.083 --> 1:23:25.000
Nose job?

1:23:25.083 --> 1:23:29.083
Wait. She told me that you started
some fucked-up rumor about her

1:23:29.166 --> 1:23:32.250
that she kissed you
and that you literally destroyed her life.

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.958
-She told you that <i>I</i> did that?
-Mm-hmm.

1:23:35.041 --> 1:23:37.750
That is so weird.
First, that she told you it was me,

1:23:37.833 --> 1:23:40.250
and second,
that you didn't immediately call bullshit.

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.625
Why would I call bullshit?

1:23:44.625 --> 1:23:46.291
You seriously don't remember?

1:23:46.375 --> 1:23:48.416
Drea, you were the one
who started that rumor.

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:49.833
What?

1:23:49.916 --> 1:23:53.125
Yeah, Eleanor is Nora Cutler,
from day camp.

1:23:53.916 --> 1:23:55.500
Nosy Nora Cutler.

1:23:58.791 --> 1:24:02.375
Oh my God! Nosy Nora.

1:24:02.958 --> 1:24:05.208
Yeah, she came out to me,

1:24:06.041 --> 1:24:06.916
and I…

1:24:09.333 --> 1:24:10.166
I…

1:24:10.250 --> 1:24:13.000
She told everyone that I tried
to hold her down and kiss her.

1:24:13.083 --> 1:24:14.666
She turned me into this predator.

1:24:17.250 --> 1:24:20.541
I don't wanna make her pay.

1:24:22.166 --> 1:24:24.541
I wanna burn her to the ground.

1:24:25.125 --> 1:24:26.833
Oh fuck.

1:24:28.750 --> 1:24:31.958
You can't sit around like this
all summer. Not again.

1:24:39.333 --> 1:24:40.333
Mom?

1:24:42.916 --> 1:24:44.125
What about tennis camp?

1:24:46.708 --> 1:24:47.833
In Palm Beach?

1:24:53.833 --> 1:24:54.708
Next up.

1:24:56.083 --> 1:24:56.958
I'll go.

1:25:10.291 --> 1:25:13.208
I wish we could, like, hire people
to take them down.

1:25:13.708 --> 1:25:15.291
What, like a fucked-up TaskRabbit?

1:25:15.875 --> 1:25:16.791
Exactly.

1:25:17.916 --> 1:25:21.250
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>was all this a little crazy? Sure.</i>

1:25:21.333 --> 1:25:24.375
<i>But I'm a teenage girl. We're psychopaths.</i>

1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.541
<i>After the ring dinner,</i>
<i>I decided to call it all off.</i>

1:25:27.625 --> 1:25:30.666
<i>Drea really seemed like she'd changed,</i>
<i>and I didn't wanna hurt her.</i>

1:25:30.750 --> 1:25:32.958
<i>She was becoming my friend.</i>

1:25:33.041 --> 1:25:36.375
<i>But after she kamikazed</i>
<i>into my birthday party,</i>

1:25:36.458 --> 1:25:38.958
<i>I realized Drea hadn't changed.</i>

1:25:39.041 --> 1:25:41.791
<i>She was the same mean girl</i>
<i>I met when I was 13,</i>

1:25:41.875 --> 1:25:45.250
<i>and she deserved everything</i>
<i>that was coming for her.</i>

1:25:53.041 --> 1:25:53.916
Mom.

1:25:54.875 --> 1:25:56.125
Hi, friend.

1:25:56.791 --> 1:26:00.958
Oh. I'm sorry. Did you have a tough day?
Your mom had an emergency shift,

1:26:01.041 --> 1:26:04.000
and she told me
you were gonna be alone for dinner.

1:26:04.083 --> 1:26:07.083
And that felt sad, so I made you dinner.

1:26:08.416 --> 1:26:11.375
You probably poisoned it, Nora.

1:26:11.458 --> 1:26:12.458
Hmm.

1:26:12.541 --> 1:26:14.583
So, do you remember Erica Norman?

1:26:15.166 --> 1:26:17.291
Of course you do.
Well, I follow her on Instagram,

1:26:17.375 --> 1:26:19.708
and she posted the funniest story
from rehab today.

1:26:19.791 --> 1:26:21.833
I know that Erica is in rehab
with Carissa,

1:26:21.916 --> 1:26:23.541
and you're calling me Nora.

1:26:24.416 --> 1:26:26.500
So, is the cat out of the bag?

1:26:26.583 --> 1:26:27.875
Get out of my house.

1:26:28.625 --> 1:26:30.083
Thought so!

1:26:31.625 --> 1:26:33.916
Oh, sorry. Burned one's for you.

1:26:35.666 --> 1:26:38.166
So, I have some really exciting news.

1:26:38.750 --> 1:26:42.333
This whole thing,
everything that we've been doing,

1:26:42.416 --> 1:26:44.250
I've had the upper hand the entire time.

1:26:45.166 --> 1:26:47.333
You made this pretty easy, I gotta say.

1:26:47.416 --> 1:26:48.750
But that's the thing.

1:26:50.083 --> 1:26:52.625
Narcissists are too focused on themselves…

1:26:52.708 --> 1:26:54.416
…to realize they're being played.

1:26:56.875 --> 1:26:58.833
You'll never get away with this.

1:26:59.833 --> 1:27:00.708
Nora.

1:27:01.958 --> 1:27:03.166
Coming after me,

1:27:04.083 --> 1:27:06.125
the optics of that aren't great.

1:27:06.875 --> 1:27:10.291
Rich white girl ruins life
of scholarship student of color.

1:27:10.375 --> 1:27:12.125
Oh, you're so dramatic.

1:27:12.208 --> 1:27:13.333
Sit down.

1:27:16.666 --> 1:27:17.833
I'm in charge now.

1:27:25.041 --> 1:27:28.333
You had me destroy Carissa for no reason.

1:27:31.041 --> 1:27:33.333
And she said
you guys actually liked each other.

1:27:33.416 --> 1:27:35.416
I did like Carissa.

1:27:36.666 --> 1:27:41.625
She was so freaked out
when <i>you </i>turned me into a lesbian leper

1:27:41.708 --> 1:27:46.458
that she jumped back into the closet
when I needed her most.

1:27:48.750 --> 1:27:52.791
As you well know,
rumors are not harmless little comments.

1:27:53.583 --> 1:27:56.000
Somebody says something in person,
someone repeats it online,

1:27:56.083 --> 1:27:59.583
and then it just grows and grows and grows
until it follows you wherever you are.

1:28:00.791 --> 1:28:01.708
I didn't eat.

1:28:02.916 --> 1:28:04.541
I didn't sleep anymore.

1:28:04.625 --> 1:28:06.458
My parents had to send me
to a treatment center.

1:28:06.541 --> 1:28:07.750
It was embarrassing.

1:28:09.166 --> 1:28:10.291
And the worst part

1:28:11.625 --> 1:28:14.791
is you don't even remember
doing this to me.

1:28:15.916 --> 1:28:17.416
I told you the entire story,

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:19.916
and you didn't know
I was talking about you.

1:28:22.708 --> 1:28:24.583
What if I had remembered?

1:28:26.291 --> 1:28:28.208
"What if? What if? What if? What if?"

1:28:28.708 --> 1:28:31.416
I wish more than anything that you had,
but you didn't.

1:28:32.250 --> 1:28:33.750
And I knew you wouldn't.

1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:38.958
Where does this game end, Nora?

1:28:40.833 --> 1:28:44.666
I lost Yale. There's literally
nothing else you could take away from me.

1:28:44.750 --> 1:28:47.416
I mean, that's simply not true.

1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:50.083
I'm sure you'll get into
a perfectly good college.

1:28:50.583 --> 1:28:53.958
I'm gonna make sure that you are stuck
with your pain forever

1:28:54.041 --> 1:28:56.500
because I know that I'm stuck with mine.

1:28:57.500 --> 1:29:00.541
It'll be like our very own version
of friendship tattoos.

1:29:01.041 --> 1:29:04.708
Except, you know, with trauma.

1:29:07.250 --> 1:29:08.083
Okay.

1:29:08.583 --> 1:29:09.916
So, here's the plan.

1:29:11.916 --> 1:29:14.458
You're gonna get back in
with your little friends,

1:29:15.041 --> 1:29:17.000
and you're gonna go
to the Admissions Party,

1:29:17.083 --> 1:29:21.041
and you are gonna push them to do
the craziest shit they have ever done.

1:29:21.750 --> 1:29:23.333
And when it all gets leaked,

1:29:23.416 --> 1:29:26.208
it'll be traced back
to an IP address on your computer.

1:29:26.833 --> 1:29:29.208
They go down. You go down.

1:29:29.958 --> 1:29:31.333
So simple, so fun.

1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:38.583
Except I can't go to the Admissions Party
because I didn't get into Yale, remember?

1:29:38.666 --> 1:29:40.791
Give me a break, Drea.

1:29:42.125 --> 1:29:45.875
I mean, I just executed
an elaborate revenge plan.

1:29:45.958 --> 1:29:48.916
You think that I can't doctor
an admissions email?

1:29:50.083 --> 1:29:51.958
If you want to ruin me, Nora,

1:29:53.208 --> 1:29:54.041
go ahead.

1:29:55.625 --> 1:29:56.958
I'm not helping you.

1:29:57.958 --> 1:30:01.416
I was worried
that you might be stubborn about this,

1:30:01.500 --> 1:30:04.500
and got me thinking about your mom.

1:30:05.666 --> 1:30:07.791
I've recently learned
that it's incredibly easy

1:30:07.875 --> 1:30:09.833
to frame people for having drugs on them.

1:30:09.916 --> 1:30:11.625
Thanks for that, by the way.

1:30:12.666 --> 1:30:14.000
So, what do you think?

1:30:14.708 --> 1:30:18.041
Aside from the fact
that this is all, like, targeting you,

1:30:18.125 --> 1:30:20.041
did I make revenge mommy proud?

1:30:27.666 --> 1:30:28.958
Oh, by the way,

1:30:29.541 --> 1:30:31.916
I, uh, told Russ what you did to Carissa.

1:30:32.958 --> 1:30:34.250
Bye.

1:30:37.250 --> 1:30:38.416
Russ?

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:42.500
Look, I don't know what Eleanor told you,
but I promise I can explain. Okay?

1:30:42.583 --> 1:30:43.833
I had no choice.

1:30:43.916 --> 1:30:46.625
The only reason I put drugs
in Carissa's dinner

1:30:46.708 --> 1:30:48.041
is because I genuinely thought--

1:30:48.125 --> 1:30:50.208
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Drea, slow down.</i>

1:30:50.291 --> 1:30:53.208
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>I haven't talked to Eleanor.</i>

1:30:54.541 --> 1:30:55.500
What?

1:30:57.500 --> 1:30:58.500
<i>Drea?</i>

1:31:00.125 --> 1:31:01.250
<i>Drea!</i>

1:31:06.291 --> 1:31:07.791
<i>Hello?</i>

1:31:38.250 --> 1:31:39.083
Hi.

1:31:40.875 --> 1:31:41.875
Hi.

1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:44.375
How are you feeling?

1:31:45.625 --> 1:31:46.500
Uh…

1:31:49.083 --> 1:31:49.958
I'm okay.

1:31:55.708 --> 1:31:57.750
Did you talk to Eleanor?

1:32:04.625 --> 1:32:06.833
Look, I don't know what she told you,

1:32:07.625 --> 1:32:10.416
but the revenge thing
was just as much her as it was me.

1:32:12.375 --> 1:32:17.125
And I'm sorry about Carissa.
I… I thought she hurt Eleanor.

1:32:20.041 --> 1:32:21.375
Turn yourself in.

1:32:29.208 --> 1:32:30.041
Right.

1:32:34.041 --> 1:32:35.875
You don't understand.

1:32:37.375 --> 1:32:40.291
Do you know what would happen to me
if I turn myself in?

1:32:40.375 --> 1:32:42.416
I'm not Carissa, Russ.

1:32:42.500 --> 1:32:46.083
I'm not just gonna get sent
to some glorified spa.

1:32:46.166 --> 1:32:49.291
I am very aware of the differences
between you and Carissa,

1:32:49.375 --> 1:32:52.416
but you decided to drug the entire class.

1:32:53.333 --> 1:32:55.791
And those texts on Max's phone…
You more than anyone should know

1:32:55.875 --> 1:32:58.458
how violating it is
to have your information leaked like that.

1:32:58.958 --> 1:33:00.875
-He deserved it.
-No, not him.

1:33:00.958 --> 1:33:03.500
All those poor girls you exposed
that ended up collateral damage.

1:33:03.583 --> 1:33:05.875
Do you ever think
about anyone other than yourself?

1:33:09.333 --> 1:33:10.833
I really wanted this to work,

1:33:11.416 --> 1:33:13.041
but it just doesn't.

1:33:17.750 --> 1:33:19.250
Did he just break up with you?

1:33:19.875 --> 1:33:21.583
I'm sorry. That's sad.

1:33:23.666 --> 1:33:25.166
Do you like this balloon?

1:33:25.250 --> 1:33:27.166
I was deciding between this and Elsa,

1:33:27.250 --> 1:33:29.708
but I kind of thought
you weren't an Elsa person.

1:33:30.250 --> 1:33:32.083
Although, you are a frigid bitch.

1:33:32.166 --> 1:33:33.333
You're a psycho.

1:33:33.416 --> 1:33:35.166
It takes one to know one.

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.291
I'm sorry that I hit you with my car.

1:33:40.375 --> 1:33:43.541
I was barely going 20 miles per hour.
It was a love tap.

1:33:44.125 --> 1:33:46.000
It was just the last piece of the puzzle.

1:33:46.083 --> 1:33:46.916
Max and them,

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.583
they were never just gonna let you
back into their group.

1:33:49.666 --> 1:33:51.708
I needed to give them a reason to.

1:33:54.583 --> 1:33:56.083
And you know…

1:33:56.958 --> 1:33:58.500
…there's nothing vapid people love more

1:33:58.583 --> 1:34:00.958
than making other people's tragedies
about them.

1:34:05.958 --> 1:34:07.500
Oh, don't cry.

1:34:07.583 --> 1:34:08.500
It's all right.

1:34:12.458 --> 1:34:13.333
Sorry.

1:34:15.875 --> 1:34:17.708
I wish it could have been different.

1:34:20.750 --> 1:34:21.666
Truly.

1:34:51.208 --> 1:34:52.458
<i>I did it.</i>

1:34:52.541 --> 1:34:54.458
<i>Soon, Drea would be annihilated.</i>

1:34:55.083 --> 1:34:58.250
<i>What should have felt exhilarating</i>
<i>just felt rotten. I… I was so lost.</i>

1:34:58.333 --> 1:35:01.708
<i>I barely recognized myself.</i>
<i>I mean, look at me.</i>

1:35:02.416 --> 1:35:05.791
<i>I did a costume change</i>
after<i> I hit Drea with my car,</i>

1:35:05.875 --> 1:35:08.250
<i>but it was just too late now.</i>

1:35:09.208 --> 1:35:11.500
<i>The only way out was through.</i>

1:35:32.833 --> 1:35:33.875
Shut up.

1:36:50.750 --> 1:36:52.250
How did you know I'd be here?

1:36:53.291 --> 1:36:54.750
This was our spot.

1:36:54.833 --> 1:36:58.083
I just figured
that you should have it this year.

1:36:58.833 --> 1:37:00.041
You needed it more.

1:37:00.625 --> 1:37:01.750
Thank you for that.

1:37:04.333 --> 1:37:05.458
How are you doing?

1:37:06.041 --> 1:37:06.958
I'm great.

1:37:09.083 --> 1:37:10.750
Yeah, I'm having a blast.

1:37:13.208 --> 1:37:14.208
I miss you.

1:37:16.791 --> 1:37:20.250
I made some really bad choices this year.

1:37:21.416 --> 1:37:25.083
I let social politics
overcomplicate things

1:37:25.166 --> 1:37:27.333
that should have been extremely simple.

1:37:27.916 --> 1:37:32.166
It shouldn't have taken an accident
for me to realize that, and I'm sorry.

1:37:38.666 --> 1:37:41.916
I know you're gonna tell me
to get lost when I say this, but…

1:37:46.083 --> 1:37:47.375
I think you're lucky.

1:37:49.875 --> 1:37:50.833
What?

1:37:51.791 --> 1:37:52.875
You got out.

1:37:55.833 --> 1:37:57.125
You're free, Drea.

1:38:01.625 --> 1:38:03.958
I don't feel free.

1:38:06.875 --> 1:38:08.708
I feel like I got hit by a car.

1:38:10.208 --> 1:38:11.708
Oh, wait. I did.

1:38:15.750 --> 1:38:16.708
I give up.

1:38:17.333 --> 1:38:18.208
I'm done.

1:38:22.333 --> 1:38:24.958
I'm sorry, but no. Nope.

1:38:25.708 --> 1:38:28.791
You're Drea fucking Torres.

1:38:28.875 --> 1:38:32.541
You're the girl who taught me
what it means to be an indomitable force.

1:38:32.625 --> 1:38:35.541
I refuse to believe that girl's dead!

1:38:35.625 --> 1:38:36.833
She's not dead.

1:38:38.375 --> 1:38:40.458
Come to the Admissions Party

1:38:40.541 --> 1:38:44.583
and show everybody at Rosehill
what a bad bitch looks like.

1:39:13.291 --> 1:39:14.875
I have a present for you.

1:39:17.083 --> 1:39:18.958
Is there a camera on that brooch?

1:39:19.041 --> 1:39:19.916
Yeah.

1:39:20.458 --> 1:39:22.750
But it matches your dress, so…

1:39:23.333 --> 1:39:24.583
You're welcome.

1:39:25.125 --> 1:39:26.416
Don't forget, Nora.

1:39:28.291 --> 1:39:29.375
I created you,

1:39:30.458 --> 1:39:33.166
and I can just as easily destroy you.

1:39:38.750 --> 1:39:41.666
Yeah!

1:39:42.708 --> 1:39:46.541
Yo, we got Mayweather…

1:39:46.625 --> 1:39:49.000
Yo, we got Mayweather-Logan part 2.0.

1:39:49.083 --> 1:39:51.416
I'd be very mad if this ends like that.

1:40:28.458 --> 1:40:29.875
Does anybody want to do some K?

1:40:29.958 --> 1:40:31.791
-Oh yes.
-Gimme.

1:40:31.875 --> 1:40:34.250
Please. Gimme, gimme.

1:40:34.333 --> 1:40:35.583
-Drea?
-I'm good.

1:40:36.291 --> 1:40:38.375
-Come on. Have some.
-No, I'm good.

1:40:38.458 --> 1:40:39.833
Come on, Dre.

1:40:40.458 --> 1:40:42.333
Do some K. Don't be a narc.

1:40:46.041 --> 1:40:48.833
You guys, can we all just look
at Eleanor right now?

1:40:48.916 --> 1:40:50.958
-You are so pretty.

1:40:51.041 --> 1:40:52.625
Isn't Eleanor so pretty?

1:40:52.708 --> 1:40:54.208
-Yes.
-So pretty.

1:40:54.291 --> 1:40:55.583
I love Eleanor.

1:40:55.666 --> 1:40:57.083
You're so pretty.

1:40:57.166 --> 1:40:58.458
So do I.

1:41:00.291 --> 1:41:03.166
-Eleanor, you're so bad.
-Yeah.

1:41:03.250 --> 1:41:05.750
You're gonna hook up with both Broussards?

1:41:06.666 --> 1:41:08.250
I thought you were into Gabbi.

1:41:08.333 --> 1:41:09.208
What?

1:41:09.291 --> 1:41:10.875
Do you like my sister?

1:41:10.958 --> 1:41:12.083
No. I…

1:41:13.333 --> 1:41:14.958
-Yeah.
-Yes!

1:41:15.041 --> 1:41:18.291
-Oh my God!
-Classic Eleanor. So full of surprises.

1:41:18.375 --> 1:41:22.666
Did you guys know
that Eleanor used to go by Nora,

1:41:22.750 --> 1:41:25.500
and she went to Big Beach Day Camp
with Tara and I?

1:41:25.583 --> 1:41:27.208
-Do you remember?
-What?

1:41:27.291 --> 1:41:28.875
No? You don't remember?

1:41:30.291 --> 1:41:32.458
Well, I guess
she looked a little different.

1:41:33.291 --> 1:41:34.458
Here.

1:41:38.916 --> 1:41:41.000
How about now? Look familiar?

1:41:41.083 --> 1:41:42.041
Oh my God!

1:41:42.125 --> 1:41:44.666
-Oh my God.
-We used to call her Nosy Nora?

1:41:44.750 --> 1:41:48.208
-Yes!
-Oh my God! Yes! Yes! Nosy Nora!

1:41:48.291 --> 1:41:51.000
-Fuck! That's Nosy Nora?
-That's Nosy Nora.

1:41:51.083 --> 1:41:53.291
Guys, we shouldn't--
No, we're not--

1:41:54.625 --> 1:41:56.833
-Eleanor, come back!
-Nosy fucking Nora.

1:41:56.916 --> 1:41:58.583
No way! I wanna touch it!

1:41:58.666 --> 1:42:01.166
Oh man. Nosy fucking Nora.

1:42:01.250 --> 1:42:04.291
I got a boob job.
It's fine, babe. It's all good.

1:42:09.666 --> 1:42:10.625
Eleanor.

1:42:11.958 --> 1:42:14.000
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

1:42:14.500 --> 1:42:16.708
I really thought
I was different than them.

1:42:18.333 --> 1:42:22.500
Every time I did something mean,
I told myself, "This isn't me."

1:42:22.583 --> 1:42:24.708
"This is just
who I have to be to survive."

1:42:25.791 --> 1:42:27.250
But that was a fucking lie.

1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.708
It was just a story I told myself
to make myself feel better

1:42:30.791 --> 1:42:32.875
about the fact
that I was just a toxic bitch.

1:42:35.125 --> 1:42:38.041
Does any of this make you feel better?
Because I'm fucking miserable.

1:42:38.125 --> 1:42:41.291
No, of course I don't feel better.
I feel like shit.

1:42:41.375 --> 1:42:42.416
So do I!

1:42:43.916 --> 1:42:44.750
Fuck.

1:42:44.833 --> 1:42:48.666
What are you doing?
No, no. Stop it, Drea. Drea, don't!

1:42:49.416 --> 1:42:52.166
None of this
is gonna make us feel better, okay?

1:42:52.250 --> 1:42:56.000
We can't erase what we did to each other,
but I don't wanna hurt you anymore,

1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:58.125
and I don't think
you wanna hurt me either.

1:42:59.416 --> 1:43:02.208
The only times
I ever felt happy this year…

1:43:05.166 --> 1:43:06.333
were when I was with you.

1:43:14.708 --> 1:43:17.000
You might be
the only real friend I've ever had.

1:43:17.708 --> 1:43:21.375
And I know
this probably means nothing now, but…

1:43:23.375 --> 1:43:26.625
if I could go back in time
to when we were kids…

1:43:28.875 --> 1:43:31.458
I would tell you,
"You're the coolest person I've ever met."

1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:34.291
Because you are.

1:43:35.333 --> 1:43:38.208
And I will regret
what I did to you forever.

1:43:39.416 --> 1:43:42.083
So, I'm sorry, Eleanor…

1:43:44.083 --> 1:43:45.041
for everything.

1:43:49.833 --> 1:43:50.833
Whoo!

1:43:50.916 --> 1:43:53.541
Wow.

1:43:54.708 --> 1:43:58.125
What a heartwarming display
of female friendship. I'm kvelling.

1:43:58.208 --> 1:44:02.333
Did you just enter doing a slow clap,
you cliché piece of shit?

1:44:02.416 --> 1:44:03.791
Oh, I'm a piece of shit?

1:44:04.291 --> 1:44:06.791
Okay. I think
you should look in the mirror, Dre.

1:44:06.875 --> 1:44:11.375
'Cause you ladies have been
very, very busy this year, haven't you?

1:44:13.541 --> 1:44:14.500
How did you get that?

1:44:14.583 --> 1:44:16.416
You put your phone
in a locked bag at my party.

1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:18.250
You didn't think
I was gonna look through it?

1:44:18.750 --> 1:44:20.333
You really are the devil.

1:44:21.166 --> 1:44:22.041
Mean.

1:44:23.791 --> 1:44:25.791
It's upsetting
that my entrepreneurial spirit

1:44:25.875 --> 1:44:28.791
has to be reduced
to such petty name-calling.

1:44:31.083 --> 1:44:33.583
But back to you two.

1:44:33.666 --> 1:44:34.625
The texts.

1:44:35.291 --> 1:44:38.333
They're a great read.
That was compelling shit.

1:44:38.416 --> 1:44:40.458
So, you two meet,

1:44:41.125 --> 1:44:43.958
and then Drea hatches this plan,
but then you come to find out

1:44:44.041 --> 1:44:46.916
that Eleanor's been playing you
the entire time? Like…

1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.000
…I did not see that coming at all.

1:44:49.083 --> 1:44:51.333
Also, I gotta--

1:44:51.416 --> 1:44:52.666
Eleanor, I thought we had

1:44:52.750 --> 1:44:54.666
a whole will-they-won't-they thing
going on.

1:44:54.750 --> 1:44:56.291
Now I find out you were pretending?

1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:57.833
Sad.

1:44:57.916 --> 1:44:59.916
Where are you going with this, Max?

1:45:00.416 --> 1:45:01.791
What's your plan?

1:45:01.875 --> 1:45:02.833
Well…

1:45:04.875 --> 1:45:07.416
I put you through enough.
I was just gonna let it all go.

1:45:07.500 --> 1:45:08.416
Really?

1:45:09.875 --> 1:45:11.500
No, not really.

1:45:12.208 --> 1:45:13.666
Why would I do that? I hate you.

1:45:13.750 --> 1:45:16.333
No, I know all your secrets now,

1:45:16.416 --> 1:45:19.250
so I'm gonna use
all the resources at my discretion

1:45:19.333 --> 1:45:22.333
to absolutely annihilate the both of you.

1:45:23.541 --> 1:45:24.833
You know how Drea and I met?

1:45:24.916 --> 1:45:27.125
It was on the first day of freshman year.

1:45:27.833 --> 1:45:28.875
I was in the library,

1:45:28.958 --> 1:45:31.416
and I overheard someone
just verbally eviscerating a teacher,

1:45:31.500 --> 1:45:33.375
and I just thought, "Who is that?"

1:45:35.083 --> 1:45:36.041
You were no one.

1:45:36.875 --> 1:45:39.041
You were
just some transplant scholarship girl

1:45:39.125 --> 1:45:42.416
who looked completely out of place,
and I welcomed you into my world.

1:45:42.500 --> 1:45:45.125
And then what did you do? You used me.

1:45:45.708 --> 1:45:48.416
Because no one would've given a shit
about you if it wasn't for me,

1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:50.041
and there was no gratitude from you.

1:45:50.125 --> 1:45:52.750
There was no, "Thank you, Max,
for making me matter."

1:45:54.125 --> 1:45:56.625
Honestly, that <i>Teen Vogue</i> video
was my breaking point.

1:45:58.083 --> 1:46:01.583
Drea, you're a conniving,
selfish sociopath

1:46:01.666 --> 1:46:05.291
who just uses everyone around you
to get exactly what you want.

1:46:08.208 --> 1:46:09.250
And so am I.

1:46:10.208 --> 1:46:11.958
Which is the source of the problem,

1:46:12.458 --> 1:46:16.666
because… most people,
if they met a clone of themselves,

1:46:16.750 --> 1:46:20.250
they would just be elated.
But you and I, we would bury it alive.

1:46:23.083 --> 1:46:24.833
Which is what I had to do to you.

1:46:27.125 --> 1:46:28.750
So I told you I loved you.

1:46:30.250 --> 1:46:32.041
I got you to make that video.

1:46:34.333 --> 1:46:37.875
And then I sent it to the entire school.

1:46:46.583 --> 1:46:47.916
Was any of it real?

1:46:50.500 --> 1:46:52.166
I don't know. Was it?

1:46:57.750 --> 1:46:58.833
Okay.

1:46:59.458 --> 1:47:02.083
I'm gonna go back to my party now
and do fucking coke

1:47:02.166 --> 1:47:05.458
off a girl's butthole…
or her belly or something. I don't know.

1:47:06.583 --> 1:47:07.458
All right.

1:47:07.541 --> 1:47:08.958
Well, bye, Dre.

1:47:10.583 --> 1:47:11.750
I really will miss you.

1:47:21.583 --> 1:47:23.125
Why the fuck are you laughing?

1:47:24.291 --> 1:47:27.208
It's called double assurance, sweetie.
Look it up.

1:47:28.166 --> 1:47:29.083
We got him.

1:47:31.041 --> 1:47:33.125
Goddamn, do I love you right now.

1:47:33.208 --> 1:47:34.875
-Oh my God.

1:47:34.958 --> 1:47:36.458
-Oh.

1:47:36.541 --> 1:47:38.083
So, we're okay?

1:47:38.166 --> 1:47:40.416
Yeah. I think so.

1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:42.083
Drea, I'm so sorry.

1:47:42.166 --> 1:47:45.375
No. It's okay.
I think we might be fucked-up soulmates.

1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.916
I know I said taking him down
wouldn't make us feel better, but…

1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:49.875
Oh.

1:47:50.541 --> 1:47:51.708
Let's do revenge.

1:47:51.791 --> 1:47:53.166
-Let's do revenge.
-Yeah.

1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:58.125
Ooh, baby.

1:47:58.666 --> 1:48:00.041
Lay down, baby.

1:48:00.666 --> 1:48:03.500
It's been a long night, but you know what?

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:08.500
You are a very lucky girl.

1:48:12.250 --> 1:48:15.041
-Who touched the aux?
-What happened to the music?

1:48:17.333 --> 1:48:18.875
Stay here, baby.

1:48:21.125 --> 1:48:22.708
I'll be back, okay?

1:48:22.791 --> 1:48:26.291
You stay there. You lay down, all right?
You can have some of that special stuff.

1:48:27.541 --> 1:48:28.375
Yo, Max!

1:48:28.458 --> 1:48:31.041
Hey, you guys stay there, okay?
I'll be back.

1:48:31.125 --> 1:48:34.208
Elliot, you better not be putting on
your goddamn music again, man.

1:48:39.416 --> 1:48:41.500
<i>Do you know how Drea</i>
<i>and I first met?</i>

1:48:41.583 --> 1:48:43.083
Are you seeing this?

1:48:44.416 --> 1:48:46.791
-<i>The first day of freshman year.</i>
What is this?

1:48:46.875 --> 1:48:50.166
-<i>I was in the library.</i>
What is that? Anyone know what this is?

1:48:50.250 --> 1:48:51.375
<i>…eviscerating a teacher.</i>

1:48:51.458 --> 1:48:54.166
-What's happening?
-<i> …a conniving, selfish sociopath…</i>

1:48:54.250 --> 1:48:55.208
What's going on?

1:48:55.291 --> 1:48:58.083
<i>…uses everyone around you</i>
<i>to get exactly what you want.</i>

1:48:58.166 --> 1:49:01.291
Hey, guys, this is… this is a joke.
I don't know what this is.

1:49:01.375 --> 1:49:03.875
But, hey, come on.
Get the party going, huh?

1:49:03.958 --> 1:49:06.666
Get a drink, man. Get a drink.
Get the music back up.

1:49:06.750 --> 1:49:09.416
-Elliot, where's the remote, man?
-I don't know.

1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:11.083
Fucking help me find it!

1:49:11.166 --> 1:49:14.041
Max, baby! Babe, hey, hey!
You looking for this?

1:49:14.125 --> 1:49:17.625
Oh my God, baby. Thank you so much.
Oh my God. I love you so much.

1:49:17.708 --> 1:49:20.000
-You love me?
-Oh my God. Yes, I love you so much.

1:49:20.083 --> 1:49:23.083
-Fuck you, Max. We're over.
-Goddamn it.

1:49:23.166 --> 1:49:24.041
Fuck!

1:49:25.791 --> 1:49:26.791
Fuck!

1:49:27.333 --> 1:49:29.250
Say goodbye to your daddy's Senate career.

1:49:29.333 --> 1:49:31.125
-Are you threatening her?
-Fucker!

1:49:31.208 --> 1:49:33.875
-Aw!
-What are you doing, you stupid bitch?

1:49:33.958 --> 1:49:35.625
Ooh, I'm just enjoying the show.

1:49:36.250 --> 1:49:39.166
Guys, this isn't real.
This is a joke.

1:49:39.250 --> 1:49:42.083
You guys, you know me.
Elliot, tell them. Tell them.

1:49:42.666 --> 1:49:44.166
I think you should leave, man.

1:49:45.291 --> 1:49:47.458
Oh, wow. Fuck you, dude!

1:49:47.541 --> 1:49:49.500
-Step the fuck back.
-Fuck you.

1:49:49.583 --> 1:49:52.666
You're fucking nothing without me.
You'd all be fucking nothing!

1:49:52.750 --> 1:49:54.833
Guys, you're turning on the wrong person.

1:49:54.916 --> 1:49:57.375
You know, this was Drea and Eleanor.
They did this.

1:49:57.458 --> 1:50:00.375
And they also drugged us all
at the ring ceremony. It was them.

1:50:00.458 --> 1:50:03.500
They also leaked all my texts
on Valentine's Day! It was them!

1:50:03.583 --> 1:50:06.583
It was fucking--
They're psychos!

1:50:06.666 --> 1:50:09.083
You know, I'm fucking glad
I leaked that video.

1:50:11.791 --> 1:50:13.041
Careful, Max.

1:50:20.666 --> 1:50:22.458
-Bye, loser.
-Move.

1:50:22.541 --> 1:50:25.166
Don't let the patriarchy hit you
on the way out.

1:51:07.083 --> 1:51:08.416
I thought you might like to know

1:51:08.500 --> 1:51:12.166
that Max Broussard has been expelled
from Rosehill effective immediately.

1:51:12.250 --> 1:51:13.375
How thrilling.

1:51:14.291 --> 1:51:15.125
Thank you.

1:51:15.208 --> 1:51:19.833
As a result, unsurprisingly,
there is a spot open at Yale.

1:51:19.916 --> 1:51:21.625
I can't promise anything,

1:51:21.708 --> 1:51:23.916
but I'd love to make a call
on your behalf.

1:51:24.791 --> 1:51:26.333
Wow.

1:51:28.416 --> 1:51:29.375
Huh.

1:51:30.791 --> 1:51:35.333
You know, all I ever wanted for as long
as I can remember was to get into Yale.

1:51:37.291 --> 1:51:39.083
But right now, in this moment,

1:51:40.583 --> 1:51:42.250
all I can think is…

1:51:44.666 --> 1:51:46.875
who cares?

1:51:46.958 --> 1:51:49.208
I don't wanna be that person anymore.

1:51:49.791 --> 1:51:51.500
May I let you in on a little secret?

1:51:51.583 --> 1:51:53.500
Your whole life, you've been cocooned.

1:51:55.041 --> 1:51:57.916
Everything you've done,
everything that's happened to you,

1:51:58.708 --> 1:52:00.416
it's brought you to this moment.

1:52:01.875 --> 1:52:04.416
And now you're a butterfly…

1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:08.125
…a beautiful kaleidoscope
of trauma and resilience.

1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.791
I know it feels like hell, but…

1:52:11.875 --> 1:52:15.083
…you are never more alive
than when you're 17 years old.

1:52:16.708 --> 1:52:18.958
Fuck figuring out who you're meant to be.

1:52:19.791 --> 1:52:21.250
Stay lost as long as you can.

1:52:23.291 --> 1:52:25.291
Let's go!

1:52:25.375 --> 1:52:26.791
Let's get out of here.

1:52:26.875 --> 1:52:31.041
Do you think it's, like, totally bonkers
that we're missing graduation?

1:52:31.125 --> 1:52:33.333
If by "bonkers," you mean "amazing."

1:52:35.250 --> 1:52:36.833
That is what I mean.

1:52:36.916 --> 1:52:38.791
Also, who says "bonkers" these days?

1:52:39.375 --> 1:52:41.333
Hmm. Cool kids.

1:52:43.791 --> 1:52:45.541
Oh my God. Turn this shit up.

1:53:41.625 --> 1:53:42.750
Hey, spot thief.

1:53:45.291 --> 1:53:46.541
What's going on here?

1:53:47.125 --> 1:53:48.000
Um,

1:53:48.708 --> 1:53:52.833
I wanted to do something cute,
like a grand gesture.

1:53:53.333 --> 1:53:57.500
But, um, I was waiting for you to walk by,
and you… you didn't.

1:53:57.583 --> 1:54:00.666
So, I guess I fell asleep.

1:54:00.750 --> 1:54:06.000
So, I told Vice Principal Norris
what I did to Carissa.

1:54:07.583 --> 1:54:12.000
Unfortunately, she's still expelled,
as she was, you know, growing drugs.

1:54:12.083 --> 1:54:14.791
-But I did tell him the truth.

1:54:15.833 --> 1:54:17.458
I talked to Drea.

1:54:18.458 --> 1:54:19.416
You did?

1:54:20.125 --> 1:54:22.000
Yeah, she told me everything.

1:54:22.958 --> 1:54:24.250
She did?

1:54:25.708 --> 1:54:26.583
Yeah.

1:54:29.791 --> 1:54:32.750
And… I dig it.

1:54:35.458 --> 1:54:36.875
What are you gonna do now?

1:54:37.833 --> 1:54:41.250
I think… I'm gonna join the Peace Corps.

1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:43.333
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:54:43.416 --> 1:54:44.666
Wow. What do they do?

1:54:44.750 --> 1:54:48.250
-Um, you know, they… restore peace.
-Mm-hmm.

1:54:48.333 --> 1:54:51.083
And lots of core work,
you know, Pilates, yoga.

1:54:51.166 --> 1:54:52.000
Awful.

1:55:08.583 --> 1:55:10.833
Wait. How did you get in--

1:55:10.916 --> 1:55:12.583
Shh. Don't worry about it.

1:55:31.500 --> 1:55:32.791
And before I start my share,

1:55:32.875 --> 1:55:35.416
I just wanna thank everyone
for this safe space.

1:55:36.875 --> 1:55:38.041
After all I've been through,

1:55:38.125 --> 1:55:42.166
it feels so nice to be part of a community
that… really sees me.

1:55:44.833 --> 1:55:46.000
I love you guys.
