00:28.558 --> 00:30.350
(investigator clears throat)

00:30.350 --> 00:31.473
- So, Mr. Hartman,

00:32.530 --> 00:34.280
maybe you can explain
to us your relationship

00:34.280 --> 00:35.623
with one Darren Mitchell.

00:39.030 --> 00:41.430
Mr. Hartman, it's imperative
that you cooperate.

00:49.750 --> 00:54.750
- It all started with
Professor Zardonicus.

00:56.070 --> 00:58.589
- [Investigator] With Professor who?

00:58.589 --> 00:59.672
- Zardonicus.

01:00.559 --> 01:03.559
(soft guitar music)

01:31.747 --> 01:33.247
- All right, just.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.249
Go. Go, please.

01:36.249 --> 01:38.760
Go, go, go. Thank you.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.593
Okay.

01:41.700 --> 01:46.700
Hello, this is Greg Hartman of comm three.

01:46.790 --> 01:50.623
Hello, this is Greg Hartman of comm 4328--

01:53.040 --> 01:53.873
- [Neighbor] Well maybe if you weren't

01:53.873 --> 01:55.130
cheating on my with my fucking brother

01:55.130 --> 01:56.600
we wouldn't be in this fucking mess!

01:56.600 --> 02:00.607
- Hi, this is Greg Hartman of comm 4328

02:02.430 --> 02:04.920
and this is my thesis video

02:04.920 --> 02:06.837
on how to be an asshole.

02:06.837 --> 02:07.670
Fuckin'.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.820
Hello, this is...

02:11.820 --> 02:12.653
That was weird.

02:13.690 --> 02:15.653
Hello, this is Greg Hartman.

02:18.460 --> 02:22.800
Hello, this is Greg Hartman of comm 4328

02:23.680 --> 02:25.260
presenting my thesis video for--

02:25.260 --> 02:27.380
- [Rachel] Hey babe,
where'd you put my computer?

02:27.380 --> 02:28.410
- I gave it back to you.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.710
- [Rachel] No, you didn't.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.148
- I'm still doing the video.

02:33.148 --> 02:34.640
- [Rachel] I have a paper due tonight.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.790
- Okay, well I, I, um...

02:38.790 --> 02:39.657
- [Rachel] I need to find it

02:39.657 --> 02:41.970
and I'm pretty sure you
didn't give it back to me.

02:41.970 --> 02:44.580
- If I told you that it
was right next to me,

02:44.580 --> 02:46.810
how would that,

02:46.810 --> 02:47.803
how would that be?

02:52.060 --> 02:53.080
It was, um...

02:53.080 --> 02:54.527
Actually, can I borrow it again tonight?

02:54.527 --> 02:55.453
- No.
- Okay.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.690
Hello, this is Greg Hartman of comm 4328

03:01.690 --> 03:05.680
with my thesis video
for our final project.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.770
Since the assignment was
to make a documentary

03:08.770 --> 03:10.840
about one of our fellow students,

03:10.840 --> 03:15.840
I made a post on the university's
official social media page

03:15.930 --> 03:17.840
and I got a variety of responses.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.180
Some with more compelling
stories than others, obviously.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.310
But then I was personally messaged

03:23.310 --> 03:26.210
by a student named Darren Mitchell

03:26.210 --> 03:29.780
and this is what he had to say.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.660
Hello, my name is Darren Mitchell.

03:31.660 --> 03:33.850
I'm responding to your Facebook post.

03:33.850 --> 03:35.090
Cutting right to the chase,

03:35.090 --> 03:37.859
I am the survivor of a violent assault

03:37.859 --> 03:40.100
that took place here on campus.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.770
After struggling to cope with this,

03:41.770 --> 03:44.813
I am finally ready to share my story.

03:45.890 --> 03:48.220
Intrigued as I was by that message,

03:48.220 --> 03:51.040
I met with Darren personally,

03:51.040 --> 03:54.070
a meeting that changed
the basis of the project

03:55.090 --> 03:56.040
quite dramatically.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.610
So, here we are now.

03:59.610 --> 04:01.500
This is the game plan, all right.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.900
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna be polite,

04:03.900 --> 04:07.180
I'm gonna be courteous, and yeah.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.623
I'll get his trust and he'll get me an A.

04:12.890 --> 04:15.730
Yeah, maybe just cut that out.

04:15.730 --> 04:17.390
So Darren has just asked me

04:17.390 --> 04:19.680
to go back and refilm our introduction.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.340
So I have to walk back up there

04:21.340 --> 04:23.120
and pretend like I didn't meet him

04:23.120 --> 04:24.633
just like five seconds ago.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.110
Okay.

04:28.110 --> 04:30.226
Second time's the charm.

04:30.226 --> 04:31.610
(knocking on door)

04:31.610 --> 04:32.443
Hello?

04:36.620 --> 04:38.037
Hello?

04:38.037 --> 04:41.630
(knocking on door)

04:41.630 --> 04:42.463
Um.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.140
Okay, I'm not really sure

04:45.140 --> 04:46.490
what I'm supposed to do right now.

04:46.490 --> 04:48.270
Maybe I should--
- Hey man, hey!

04:48.270 --> 04:49.103
How's it going?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.239
Greg, right?

04:51.239 --> 04:52.290
(Darren chuckles)

04:52.290 --> 04:53.123
- [Greg] Yeah.

04:53.123 --> 04:55.640
- Oh, pleasure to meet
you, man. I'm Darren.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.520
- [Greg] Yeah.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.290
- I didn't keep you waiting
for too long, did I?

04:59.290 --> 05:00.670
- [Greg] No, actually I just got here.

05:00.670 --> 05:03.260
- Perfect. Would you like to come inside?

05:03.260 --> 05:04.380
- Sure.
- Great.

05:04.380 --> 05:05.366
Sorry I kept you waiting.

05:05.366 --> 05:07.240
I was volunteering at
the homeless shelter.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.650
Things went overtime.

05:08.650 --> 05:09.483
- [Greg] Okay.

05:09.483 --> 05:10.316
- Was that good?

05:11.259 --> 05:12.594
- [Greg] Was what good?

05:12.594 --> 05:14.080
- Was that take good?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.480
Like me coming up there

05:15.480 --> 05:18.110
and saying the thing about
the homeless shelter?

05:18.110 --> 05:20.650
Make me look good?
- Yeah that was perfect.

05:20.650 --> 05:21.483
- Cool, you don't wanna
do it again in case or?

05:21.483 --> 05:23.480
- [Greg] No, we can just go inside.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.030
- [Darren] Hey, so this
thing is on, right?

05:25.030 --> 05:26.490
Like it's recording?

05:26.490 --> 05:27.500
- [Greg] Oh, the mic? Yeah.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.810
- Yeah. Okay.

05:28.810 --> 05:29.840
Well, here you go.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.260
Welcome to my home. (chuckles)

05:32.260 --> 05:34.720
Sorry I didn't have much
of a chance to clean up.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.400
- [Greg] Oh, it's all good.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.570
Yeah, do you live here with a roommate?

05:38.570 --> 05:40.683
- No, just me and the voices in my head.

05:41.990 --> 05:44.220
Oh, (chuckles) that was a joke.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.377
It's completely a joke.

05:45.377 --> 05:46.210
- [Greg] Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:46.210 --> 05:47.090
Yeah, no. I could tell.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.530
- Okay, good 'cause sometimes I say it

05:49.530 --> 05:51.460
and people think I'm serious.

05:51.460 --> 05:53.350
They can't tell when I'm joking.

05:53.350 --> 05:55.580
It causes some awkward interactions.

05:55.580 --> 05:56.413
- [Greg] Oh, that's weird

05:56.413 --> 05:57.830
'cause I could definitely
tell you were joking.

05:57.830 --> 05:58.663
- Oh, well good.

05:58.663 --> 06:00.663
I'm glad you could tell.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.330
Do you want anything to drink?

06:03.330 --> 06:04.820
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

06:04.820 --> 06:06.640
- [Greg] Yeah, so how do
you wanna approach this?

06:06.640 --> 06:07.660
- [Darren] Hmm?

06:07.660 --> 06:09.580
- [Greg] You know, the
interview and stuff.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.160
- [Darren] Oh, um, I don't know.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.800
What'd you have in mind?

06:12.800 --> 06:13.810
- [Greg] Well, we could sit down

06:13.810 --> 06:17.197
and you could talk to
me about the incident,

06:17.197 --> 06:18.190
how it's affected you,

06:18.190 --> 06:20.499
and we can just go from there.

06:20.499 --> 06:21.332
(Darren sighs)

06:21.332 --> 06:24.020
- Actually, there's
something I should tell you.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.360
Now, I don't want you to think

06:25.360 --> 06:28.170
I'm a bad guy or a liar or anything.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.240
- [Greg] Wait, did you lie
about getting assaulted?

06:30.240 --> 06:31.410
- Oh, no, no, no.

06:31.410 --> 06:32.980
I got assaulted. See?

06:32.980 --> 06:33.813
- [Greg] Oh my God!

06:33.813 --> 06:35.360
- [Darren] I know, it's nasty, right?

06:35.360 --> 06:36.750
- [Greg] Jesus, that looks like

06:36.750 --> 06:38.520
an animal attack or something.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.133
- See, that's the complicated part.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.533
Have you ever heard of
Professor Zardonicus?

06:47.990 --> 06:49.250
- [Greg] No.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.243
What class does he teach?

06:53.531 --> 06:54.364
Darren?

06:55.770 --> 06:57.530
Hey, what's going on?

06:57.530 --> 06:58.390
- Just...

06:59.330 --> 07:00.250
Before you come in here,

07:00.250 --> 07:01.083
I need you to,

07:02.250 --> 07:03.700
I need you to be ready, okay?

07:04.910 --> 07:05.743
- [Greg] Okay.

07:12.370 --> 07:15.370
(soft guitar music)

07:18.416 --> 07:19.249
Dude.

07:23.525 --> 07:25.520
What is this?

07:25.520 --> 07:28.120
Like, what am I looking at?

07:28.120 --> 07:29.210
- [Darren] The kids on campus

07:29.210 --> 07:30.783
thought he was an urban legend.

07:33.317 --> 07:34.473
Honestly, so did I.

07:36.850 --> 07:38.203
That is, until that night.

07:39.870 --> 07:40.880
- [Greg] Wait, hold on.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.177
You're saying this thing attacked you?

07:46.960 --> 07:49.820
- I was on campus late one night.

07:49.820 --> 07:52.573
I was working an
all-nighter for a midterm.

07:55.172 --> 07:56.470
As I was walking to my car

07:56.470 --> 08:01.143
I heard this rustling in the bushes.

08:02.635 --> 08:04.483
I thought maybe it was a squirrel.

08:06.671 --> 08:07.588
But then...

08:10.761 --> 08:12.844
Then it started growling.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.757
I tried to run.

08:16.953 --> 08:19.963
But I barely got two
steps before he attacked.

08:23.464 --> 08:25.583
But then I came home.

08:25.583 --> 08:28.233
I came home and I started drawing.

08:29.420 --> 08:33.193
I drew and I drew until I
finally got the right one.

08:34.406 --> 08:36.559
And now, (laughs),

08:36.559 --> 08:37.593
now that I have the right one

08:37.593 --> 08:40.180
and now that I have you, Greg,

08:40.180 --> 08:44.100
I can do this.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.870
- [Greg] Do what exactly?

08:46.870 --> 08:49.310
- I can prove that I wasn't lying.

08:49.310 --> 08:51.930
That Professor Zardonicus is real.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.623
But I can only do this with you, Greg.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.843
- [Greg] I'm going to help you prove this?

09:00.843 --> 09:01.676
- Mm-hmm.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.480
- [Greg] That's why I'm here?

09:04.480 --> 09:06.000
- Absolutely. I mean, it's so simple.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.074
If we just follow my plan exactly

09:08.074 --> 09:10.070
we can prove that he was--
- Can I go to the bathroom?

09:10.070 --> 09:11.270
Please, just real quick?

09:12.810 --> 09:13.643
- Um...

09:14.490 --> 09:15.873
Sure, yeah.

09:17.074 --> 09:18.174
It's down the hallway.

09:19.070 --> 09:19.903
- Thanks!

09:20.850 --> 09:22.310
Holy shit, holy shit.

09:26.704 --> 09:27.537
Okay.

09:30.460 --> 09:33.423
So clearly we've shifted
gears a little bit.

09:34.350 --> 09:37.300
My subject appears to be under the belief

09:37.300 --> 09:40.860
that he encountered an urban legend

09:40.860 --> 09:44.700
named Professor something.

09:44.700 --> 09:48.190
Now, obviously, given
the scratches on his arm,

09:48.190 --> 09:50.420
he must've been attacked
by some kind of animal.

09:50.420 --> 09:53.200
Now whether he believes that animal

09:53.200 --> 09:56.920
to actually be his mystical professor,

09:56.920 --> 09:58.253
that remains to be seen.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.410
But what doesn't remain to be seen

10:01.410 --> 10:03.330
is that this is going to make

10:03.330 --> 10:06.570
for a much more interesting
project than I anticipated.

10:06.570 --> 10:08.100
So, yes.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.173
This is what I'm going with.

10:11.270 --> 10:12.190
Hey, Darren?

10:12.190 --> 10:13.190
- Oh, hey.

10:13.190 --> 10:14.940
I hope I didn't scare you off.

10:14.940 --> 10:15.980
- [Greg] No, no, not at all.

10:15.980 --> 10:18.580
Actually, I've come to
the decision that, yes,

10:18.580 --> 10:22.123
I will absolutely make
this documentary with you.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.180
- You will?

10:24.180 --> 10:25.070
- [Greg] Yeah, man.

10:25.070 --> 10:28.490
Somebody's gotta shed the
light on the truth, right?

10:28.490 --> 10:30.157
- Oh my God.

10:30.157 --> 10:31.700
That's amazing. Thank you!

10:31.700 --> 10:33.230
- [Greg] Oh, no, no. You're good.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.480
- Thank you, man.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.350
I really, really thank you.

10:36.350 --> 10:37.183
- [Greg] Yeah, okay.

10:37.183 --> 10:38.350
- You know what?

10:38.350 --> 10:40.015
I'm gonna pour us a drink, hmm?

10:40.015 --> 10:41.160
You wanna drink?
- Yeah, go for it.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.470
Yeah, sure.

10:42.470 --> 10:45.820
- First and foremost,
that camera you got there,

10:45.820 --> 10:47.170
that should not be turned off.

10:47.170 --> 10:48.840
That should be constantly rolling.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.570
In an investigation like this,

10:50.570 --> 10:52.240
you can't afford to miss a thing, right?

10:52.240 --> 10:53.930
Next thing, we're on the search

10:53.930 --> 10:55.023
for truth here, Greg, all right?

10:55.023 --> 10:57.260
You know what that means?

10:57.260 --> 11:00.880
That means we're gonna face
trials and tribulations.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.060
All sorts of nasty things,
lots of tough stuff.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.080
There's gonna be critics and cynics

11:06.080 --> 11:07.270
that tell us we're wrong

11:07.270 --> 11:09.650
and that what we believe isn't true.

11:09.650 --> 11:12.420
Well you know what I say to them, Greg?

11:12.420 --> 11:15.960
I say the truth will show
them what's really going on.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.720
And you know who's gonna
find the truth, Greg?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.150
Us.

11:20.150 --> 11:21.610
- [Greg] All right.

11:21.610 --> 11:22.730
Okay.

11:22.730 --> 11:24.655
To Professor Zadromatis.

11:24.655 --> 11:26.910
- Zardonicus.
- Zardonicus, sorry.

11:26.910 --> 11:28.880
- There you go.
(glasses clink)

11:28.880 --> 11:30.290
- Once I accepted Darren's offer,

11:30.290 --> 11:32.430
I decided to become more acquainted

11:32.430 --> 11:34.760
with the legend of Professor Zardonicus

11:34.760 --> 11:37.030
and I did some research.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.190
Hey, babe?
- Yep?

11:39.190 --> 11:42.540
- [Greg] Have you ever heard
of Professor Zardonicus?

11:42.540 --> 11:44.303
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

11:44.303 --> 11:46.330
Why are you asking about this?

11:46.330 --> 11:47.440
- [Greg] Oh, it's for a project.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.150
So, he's like an urban legend right?

11:51.150 --> 11:52.120
- Yes.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.860
Yeah, around campus I think.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.290
We were at orientation

11:55.290 --> 11:57.244
and they made this joke about,

11:57.244 --> 11:59.493
remember to watch out
for Professor Zardonicus

11:59.493 --> 12:01.870
when you're walking out at night

12:01.870 --> 12:02.703
or something like that.

12:02.703 --> 12:03.690
- [Greg] Okay, um.

12:03.690 --> 12:08.223
Is he like something that
you would take seriously?

12:09.086 --> 12:10.605
(Rachel chuckles)

12:10.605 --> 12:12.680
- Do you want me to
ask him out for coffee,

12:12.680 --> 12:15.820
to get a feel for who he is?

12:15.820 --> 12:17.950
- [Greg] I mean, like, if I told you

12:17.950 --> 12:19.770
that I think there might be something

12:19.770 --> 12:21.930
to this whole Zardonicus thing,

12:21.930 --> 12:23.898
how would you react to that?

12:23.898 --> 12:26.586
- (laughs) You're joking right?

12:26.586 --> 12:29.170
- [Greg] No, it's for a project.

12:29.170 --> 12:30.700
- On a scale--
- This is worth

12:30.700 --> 12:32.960
like a fourth of my total grade, Rachel.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.600
So please take this seriously.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.480
- I didn't realize that
we were being serious.

12:38.610 --> 12:40.454
- [Greg] Okay, yeah. You're, yeah.

12:40.454 --> 12:41.287
- What?
- Fuck, whatever.

12:41.287 --> 12:42.860
- I'm participating!
- Okay.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.760
From this interaction it became clear

12:44.760 --> 12:47.270
that in order to uncover
any kind of real truth

12:47.270 --> 12:49.050
behind the Zardonicus legend,

12:49.050 --> 12:50.810
I would really have to dig.

12:50.810 --> 12:53.060
So I decided to go straight to the source

12:53.060 --> 12:54.930
and ask the student body directly

12:54.930 --> 12:56.470
what they know, if anything,

12:56.470 --> 12:58.103
about this mysterious legend.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.160
Mysterious fucking legend.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.410
Jesus Christ.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.010
Hey, guys. Hey.

13:03.010 --> 13:05.072
Hey, hi. Excuse me?

13:05.072 --> 13:06.239
- Yeah?
- What?

13:07.140 --> 13:08.180
- [Greg] Could you tell me what you know

13:08.180 --> 13:10.830
about Professor Zardonicus?

13:10.830 --> 13:13.187
- Well, I know he was a
professor here in the '50s.

13:13.187 --> 13:15.320
He was a chemistry professor.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.710
- None of his students really liked him.

13:16.710 --> 13:19.390
They thought he was mean
and terrible or whatever.

13:19.390 --> 13:22.223
- [Greg] Do you have any
idea of where he comes from?

13:23.340 --> 13:24.173
- Uh.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.180
Texas?

13:26.180 --> 13:27.860
- He worked in the old science building

13:27.860 --> 13:30.901
and there was like something with a fire?

13:30.901 --> 13:33.310
- [Greg] Hey, could you tell
me about Professor Zardonicus?

13:33.310 --> 13:35.203
- Man, fuck off, man.

13:36.130 --> 13:36.963
- [Greg] Okay.

13:36.963 --> 13:39.850
This is kind of an expensive camera.

13:39.850 --> 13:42.050
- A senior of class, I
don't remember which one.

13:42.050 --> 13:44.357
- Decided to play a prank on him.

13:44.357 --> 13:49.280
- And that prank set the fire
in that old science building.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.880
- Apparently, a lot of people
got out and everything,

13:51.880 --> 13:53.491
if not everybody.

13:53.491 --> 13:54.360
- [Greg] Did he get out?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.560
- No, except for Zardonicus

13:55.560 --> 13:57.120
and there goes the legend.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.980
- [Greg] So what happened with that?

13:58.980 --> 14:02.820
- Oh well, like, people say
that his body was never found.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.680
- If you go in the building or something,

14:04.680 --> 14:08.434
he's supposed to attack
you or, I don't know.

14:08.434 --> 14:09.330
I don't know. (chuckles)

14:09.330 --> 14:12.290
- [Greg] Do you think
you've ever seen him?

14:12.290 --> 14:13.803
- Uh.

14:13.803 --> 14:16.180
I think I ran into him
at Walmart the other day.

14:16.180 --> 14:19.740
- He's like this weird like monster thing.

14:19.740 --> 14:21.690
The fucking ears of a bear,

14:21.690 --> 14:22.950
the snout of a wolf.

14:22.950 --> 14:24.100
- Sounds like a--
- He's got fucking

14:24.100 --> 14:25.280
scales on his arms.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.660
- Dude, there's like multiple people

14:26.660 --> 14:28.080
in my lab that look like that.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.830
- It's just turned into this big thing

14:29.830 --> 14:32.980
that's lasted for, since 1950, Jesus.

14:32.980 --> 14:34.810
- [Greg] Yeah, so if somebody were

14:34.810 --> 14:38.400
to try to prove that he were real,

14:38.400 --> 14:39.860
what would it take, I guess,

14:39.860 --> 14:41.470
to convince you of that?

14:41.470 --> 14:42.583
- Just footage, man.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.250
Just footage. Like anything else.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.540
- [Greg] With my research
providing no results,

14:47.540 --> 14:50.520
I had to imagine that there
was no Professor Zardonicus

14:50.520 --> 14:52.530
and that the only connection to reality

14:52.530 --> 14:54.010
that this story has,

14:54.010 --> 14:57.130
is the fire that took place
in the old science building.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.730
However, I also discovered

14:58.730 --> 15:03.400
a 1961 film titled "Mr. Sardonicus".

15:03.400 --> 15:05.570
The timing being too coincidental,

15:05.570 --> 15:09.550
it became clear how this
legend began and spread.

15:09.550 --> 15:11.100
That being said, I do not know

15:11.100 --> 15:13.990
how Darren plans to prove
himself or this legend

15:13.990 --> 15:16.436
but I cannot wait to find out.

15:16.436 --> 15:17.353
- Hey, man.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.450
- [Greg] Hey, how's it going?

15:19.450 --> 15:21.210
- Going good. You ready for this?

15:21.210 --> 15:22.153
- [Greg] Yeah, yeah I think so.

15:22.153 --> 15:23.820
What about you?

15:23.820 --> 15:25.340
- I mean, honestly I'm a little nervous,

15:25.340 --> 15:27.680
but yeah I think I'm ready.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.810
- [Greg] Why are you nervous?

15:28.810 --> 15:30.470
- I mean, we're hunting
down the truth, Greg,

15:30.470 --> 15:32.370
and that doesn't come easy to anybody.

15:33.290 --> 15:35.120
- [Greg] Well, uh...

15:35.120 --> 15:36.430
Well, that's a cool jacket.

15:36.430 --> 15:37.263
- Oh, really?

15:37.263 --> 15:38.096
Thanks, man.

15:38.096 --> 15:38.929
It was my dad's.

15:38.929 --> 15:40.820
He fought in Vietnam.

15:40.820 --> 15:41.900
- [Greg] Oh, seriously?

15:41.900 --> 15:42.733
- Yeah.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.400
I guess I have warrior's blood
running through my veins.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.000
Anyway, I don't know
what kind of equipment

15:47.000 --> 15:48.020
we were planning on working with,

15:48.020 --> 15:51.060
but I went ahead and got us a
couple of those just in case.

15:51.060 --> 15:52.050
- [Greg] Wait, GoPros?

15:52.050 --> 15:52.883
You got GoPros?

15:52.883 --> 15:53.940
- You heard of them?

15:53.940 --> 15:54.830
- [Greg] Well, yeah, Darren.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.420
They're really expensive.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.400
- You know what comes cheap, Greg?

15:58.400 --> 15:59.651
Denial.

15:59.651 --> 16:01.890
But the truth doesn't come cheap.

16:01.890 --> 16:02.903
That's priceless.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.260
- [Greg] Okay, so uh,

16:07.260 --> 16:08.500
what are we gonna be doing today?

16:08.500 --> 16:11.823
- Ah, we're actually gonna be doing this.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.593
- [Greg] Whoa.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.910
We better get started then.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.580
- Yeah. Come on, hop in.

16:19.580 --> 16:20.413
- [Greg] Jesus.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.120
- Oh, hey man, you want some coffee?

16:23.120 --> 16:24.610
- [Greg] No, thanks. I'm good.

16:24.610 --> 16:25.880
- I envy you.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.020
I can't function without at least

16:27.020 --> 16:28.320
three cups in the morning.

16:30.140 --> 16:32.750
- [Greg] So, Darren, what's
your intention for today?

16:32.750 --> 16:34.170
- Well, my intention for today

16:34.170 --> 16:36.100
is to spread awareness, you know?

16:36.100 --> 16:38.240
Lay the groundwork for the whole project.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.420
Now, I'm not naive.

16:39.420 --> 16:40.580
I don't think that I'm gonna be able

16:40.580 --> 16:43.480
to find this fantastic creature on my own.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.840
This is gonna be a whole student affair.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.470
We're gonna need the entire
student body on our side.

16:47.470 --> 16:48.770
We have attended this campus

16:48.770 --> 16:52.030
completely blind to reality for years

16:52.030 --> 16:53.510
and the reality we do receive

16:53.510 --> 16:57.230
we mock and sneer at with
this postmodern cynicism.

16:57.230 --> 16:59.750
But we're gonna break through that, Greg.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.880
That camera you got there?

17:01.880 --> 17:03.480
That's the battering ram.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.803
You have the argument being made

17:04.803 --> 17:07.970
that in a more scientifically
advanced society

17:07.970 --> 17:09.150
such as our own,

17:09.150 --> 17:10.750
something like Professor Zardonicus

17:10.750 --> 17:13.230
would've been disproved by now.

17:13.230 --> 17:14.530
The fallacy in that statement

17:14.530 --> 17:17.730
is that, as we grow as
a scientific society,

17:17.730 --> 17:19.640
we become more knowledgeable.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.610
When, in fact, I believe the opposite.

17:21.610 --> 17:23.020
- [Greg] Wait, you're saying that science

17:23.020 --> 17:24.740
makes us more ignorant?

17:24.740 --> 17:26.251
- Well, not exactly.

17:26.251 --> 17:28.292
Let me rephrase it for you.

17:28.292 --> 17:30.560
Before the scientific advancements,

17:30.560 --> 17:32.670
we were far more inclined as a society

17:32.670 --> 17:34.910
to believe the highly fanciful.

17:34.910 --> 17:36.940
We would use these fantastic ideas

17:36.940 --> 17:40.970
to justify expressions beyond our grasp.

17:40.970 --> 17:45.823
Now, science has devolved into
this confirmation bias game.

17:46.770 --> 17:49.800
We try to disprove theories
that differ from our own.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.900
When our realities don't coincide,

17:51.900 --> 17:54.800
we tend to believe the one that
we're most comfortable with.

17:54.800 --> 17:59.540
We, as a society, have turned
into these snide cynics

17:59.540 --> 18:02.080
of ideas that differ from our own.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.670
We are inclined to only believe

18:03.670 --> 18:06.050
what is directly in front of our eyes.

18:06.050 --> 18:08.170
For example, if I were to tell you

18:08.170 --> 18:12.090
that at one point the world
was overrun by giant lizards,

18:12.090 --> 18:14.350
now that'd be a hard
pill to swallow, right?

18:14.350 --> 18:15.560
It doesn't matter that it's true

18:15.560 --> 18:17.210
or that I'm right.

18:17.210 --> 18:18.380
The fact of the matter is

18:18.380 --> 18:21.080
that because it's not directly
in front of your eyes,

18:21.080 --> 18:23.673
you're gonna have a hard
time believing it to be true.

18:24.810 --> 18:27.260
- [Greg] Hey, so when Professor
Zardonicus attacked you,

18:27.260 --> 18:28.160
how did you escape?

18:28.160 --> 18:29.830
It seemed, you know, pretty vicious.

18:29.830 --> 18:31.500
- Well, see, I've been
thinking about that a lot

18:31.500 --> 18:33.640
and from what I can figure,

18:33.640 --> 18:35.570
I must've just ran away quick enough

18:35.570 --> 18:38.290
before he really got his claws into me.

18:38.290 --> 18:39.123
But when he came out,

18:39.123 --> 18:41.610
his huge claws were
just swinging everywhere

18:41.610 --> 18:43.710
like some kind of beast, you know?

18:43.710 --> 18:45.570
But it's weird

18:46.850 --> 18:50.223
because it didn't seem
like he wanted to kill me.

18:51.420 --> 18:54.290
- [Greg] Like he just wanted to scare you?

18:54.290 --> 18:55.830
- I don't know. It's hard to explain.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.260
Maybe in his warped mind,

18:58.260 --> 19:00.450
this campus is like his home.

19:00.450 --> 19:02.370
You know, his territory.

19:02.370 --> 19:05.163
- [Greg] So, do you think
there's humanity left in him?

19:06.430 --> 19:07.660
- I don't know. It's hard to say.

19:07.660 --> 19:09.320
How do you define humanity?

19:09.320 --> 19:10.730
Is it more of a--
- Yo!

19:10.730 --> 19:13.503
The fuck is this?
- What?

19:13.503 --> 19:15.180
- This shit serious?

19:15.180 --> 19:16.550
- No, I'm just going around

19:16.550 --> 19:18.240
hanging up these posters ironically.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.240
What do you think?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.500
- Y'all got some off the wall
shit going on right here.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.490
I don't really know
what it is but thank you

19:23.490 --> 19:24.650
'cause you made my fucking day.

19:24.650 --> 19:25.500
- Oh, well that's great,

19:25.500 --> 19:28.380
'cause it's not hard to
make an imbecile's day, huh?

19:28.380 --> 19:29.790
- Uh, Darren?
- Imbecile?

19:29.790 --> 19:31.330
What the fuck does that mean?

19:31.330 --> 19:32.880
- [Greg] Uh, okay guys.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.280
- No, no, no, no, I get it!

19:34.280 --> 19:35.740
This is some kind of
fucking joke, isn't it?

19:35.740 --> 19:37.190
- What? A joke?

19:37.190 --> 19:38.190
Oh, that's great, you know,

19:38.190 --> 19:40.050
because I'm sure Christianity seemed

19:40.050 --> 19:41.470
like a joke at the time too, right?

19:41.470 --> 19:42.376
- Hey bro, what the fuck!

19:42.376 --> 19:43.209
- [Greg] Hey, hey, hey.

19:43.209 --> 19:44.233
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

19:44.233 --> 19:45.270
He's just messing...

19:45.270 --> 19:46.800
We're just messing around.

19:46.800 --> 19:47.790
Yeah, it's just a joke.

19:47.790 --> 19:50.280
And actually, we're done.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.113
We're done for the day.

19:51.113 --> 19:52.523
- Man, fuck y'all.

19:54.134 --> 19:55.723
- [Greg] Darren, what.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.360
- I'm sorry things had to get so ugly

19:59.360 --> 20:00.690
so quickly back there, Greg,

20:00.690 --> 20:04.110
but I guess that's people for ya.

20:04.110 --> 20:06.510
- [Greg] Well, you didn't
really seem fazed by it.

20:06.510 --> 20:07.670
- Well, yeah, I mean that kinda stuff

20:07.670 --> 20:08.740
happens to you enough times,

20:08.740 --> 20:09.990
you kinda get used to it.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.340
- [Greg] That happens to you a lot?

20:12.340 --> 20:13.440
- Well, yeah, Greg.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.850
I mean, when I went to the police

20:14.850 --> 20:17.850
and told them about Professor Zardonicus,

20:17.850 --> 20:19.550
they laughed in my face.

20:19.550 --> 20:22.160
- [Greg] But what'd they say
about the wounds on your arm?

20:22.160 --> 20:24.650
- Thought they were self-inflicted.

20:24.650 --> 20:25.483
They thought I was trying

20:25.483 --> 20:27.053
to get a lawsuit out of the school.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.020
- [Greg] A lawsuit?

20:29.020 --> 20:30.100
I don't get it.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.800
- Well, think about it this way, Greg.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.550
There's a 50 year old monster

20:33.550 --> 20:36.590
roaming around campus
attacking college students.

20:36.590 --> 20:38.253
How's that look for campus PR?

20:39.796 --> 20:41.159
- [Greg] What do your
friends think about this?

20:41.159 --> 20:43.180
(Darren coughs)

20:43.180 --> 20:45.520
- Sorry, that's really watered down.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.910
What were you saying?

20:46.910 --> 20:47.980
- [Greg] I was just
wondering what your friends

20:47.980 --> 20:48.850
think about all this.

20:48.850 --> 20:50.820
- Oh, you know, I don't burden myself

20:50.820 --> 20:52.350
with the issue of companionship.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.883
So it's not really a
problem what they think.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.944
- [Greg] Oh, okay.

20:56.944 --> 20:58.240
- What about you?

20:58.240 --> 20:59.420
What do your friends think?

20:59.420 --> 21:01.270
- [Greg] Well, I've
only told my girlfriend.

21:01.270 --> 21:03.480
- Oh, well what did she say?

21:03.480 --> 21:04.870
- [Greg] Well, she's uh...

21:04.870 --> 21:08.159
She's skeptical by nature, I'd say, so.

21:08.159 --> 21:10.290
- Does she go to school here?

21:10.290 --> 21:11.123
- [Greg] Yeah, yeah.

21:11.123 --> 21:12.590
She's a civil engineering major.

21:12.590 --> 21:14.370
- Oh, that must be interesting,

21:14.370 --> 21:15.963
engineering civility and all.

21:16.970 --> 21:17.803
- [Greg] Right.

21:17.803 --> 21:19.010
Well, I mean, it pays a lot.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.570
It's like one of the highest
paying degrees out there.

21:21.570 --> 21:22.980
It's a lot more lucrative than film,

21:22.980 --> 21:24.730
I can tell you that much.

21:24.730 --> 21:29.140
- Yeah, well she does support
your film making, right?

21:29.140 --> 21:29.973
- [Greg] Yeah.

21:29.973 --> 21:32.070
Well, there's not a whole
lot to support right now

21:32.070 --> 21:34.620
just 'cause I'm mostly
focused on my vlogs.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.100
- Oh.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.630
Wait, vlogs or?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.563
- I know guys are really into twins.

21:39.563 --> 21:41.140
I don't really get that whole thing.

21:41.140 --> 21:42.940
I mean, yeah, there are two of them.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.100
Yeah, I have like 500
subscribers, actually.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.030
So it's pretty cool.

21:47.030 --> 21:49.560
- That's good. You do that by yourself?

21:49.560 --> 21:50.542
- [Greg] For the most parts,

21:50.542 --> 21:53.973
just 'cause everybody's
busy with school and stuff.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.060
- You see, Greg, that's...

21:58.170 --> 22:01.400
That right there's the
problem with school, okay?

22:01.400 --> 22:02.570
There's people like you and me

22:02.570 --> 22:04.910
who are out here trying
to achieve our dreams,

22:04.910 --> 22:07.210
trying to show the world our truths,

22:07.210 --> 22:09.190
and what are our friends doing, hmm?

22:09.190 --> 22:10.700
They're getting degrees,

22:10.700 --> 22:13.020
they're getting careers, making money.

22:13.020 --> 22:16.223
It makes me sick to my stomach, Greg.

22:19.752 --> 22:21.230
(Darren laughs)

22:21.230 --> 22:23.760
But that's why you and I gotta
stick together, right, Greg?

22:23.760 --> 22:24.653
Just you and me.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.410
And that is just as
disgusting as it was before.

22:28.410 --> 22:29.890
I'm gonna go get another drink.

22:29.890 --> 22:30.990
Do you want something?

22:30.990 --> 22:31.823
- [Greg] No, I'm good. Thanks.

22:31.823 --> 22:33.130
- Okay, I'll be right back.

22:36.902 --> 22:38.000
(Greg sighs)

22:38.000 --> 22:40.150
- [Greg] So I think that was
a pretty solid first day.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.640
We got some good stuff.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.060
Yeah, let's just figure
out when we're gonna--

22:43.060 --> 22:45.623
- No, no, no. We're not done, Greg.

22:46.787 --> 22:48.020
- [Greg] Uh, okay.

22:48.020 --> 22:49.550
Well, what are we gonna do?

22:49.550 --> 22:51.126
- We're gonna find him.

22:51.126 --> 22:52.640
(Greg laughs)

22:52.640 --> 22:53.473
- [Greg] What?

22:54.604 --> 22:56.810
How are we gonna find him?

22:56.810 --> 22:58.190
- From up there.

22:58.190 --> 22:59.023
- [Greg] Wait.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.860
Um...

23:01.820 --> 23:03.686
I'm sorry. Are we allowed
to go up there right now?

23:03.686 --> 23:04.980
- (chuckles) That's funny.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.620
I think that's what the
Washington Post asked

23:06.620 --> 23:08.497
before they published the
Pentagon papers, Greg.

23:08.497 --> 23:10.220
- What?
- Come on.

23:10.220 --> 23:12.450
If anything else, it'll
make for good footage.

23:12.450 --> 23:14.223
- [Greg] That was in like 1972.

23:20.010 --> 23:20.843
See anything?

23:22.220 --> 23:23.053
- No.

23:24.449 --> 23:25.282
Do you?

23:26.880 --> 23:29.233
- [Greg] Nah, just some
illegally parked cars.

23:30.290 --> 23:31.420
- Of course.

23:31.420 --> 23:32.820
I come out here in search for the truth

23:32.820 --> 23:35.413
and find a bunch of misdemeanors instead.

23:38.120 --> 23:38.953
Hey, you...

23:40.030 --> 23:42.253
You believe me, don't you, Greg?

23:43.490 --> 23:46.240
- [Greg] What, about Professor Zardonicus?

23:46.240 --> 23:47.623
Well yeah, of course I believe you.

23:47.623 --> 23:50.520
I wouldn't be doing this
project if I didn't.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.353
- Good.

23:52.550 --> 23:54.170
That's good.

23:54.170 --> 23:55.360
The only thing worse than monsters

23:55.360 --> 23:56.960
are the people who exploit them.

23:58.150 --> 23:59.690
- [Greg] Well, couldn't some people say

23:59.690 --> 24:01.160
that you're exploiting him,

24:01.160 --> 24:03.430
you know, for publicity maybe?

24:03.430 --> 24:05.640
- See, I've thought about that, Greg.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.473
I really have.

24:06.473 --> 24:09.223
But I can't let that cloud my judgment.

24:10.330 --> 24:13.500
I can't let it get in the
way of our investigation.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.560
We're on the search for truth.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.143
The people of this campus,

24:17.980 --> 24:20.240
they deserve to know the truth

24:20.240 --> 24:21.890
even if they choose to reject it.

24:24.635 --> 24:25.468
- [Greg] I don't know, man.

24:25.468 --> 24:28.280
You just seem so righteous
about the whole thing.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.640
- Only the discontent would see that

24:29.640 --> 24:31.060
as a criticism, Greg.

24:31.060 --> 24:33.110
Some people might say it's harsh.

24:33.110 --> 24:36.040
But you know what I
would say is harsh, Greg?

24:36.040 --> 24:38.200
I would say turning
your chemistry professor

24:38.200 --> 24:41.090
into a mythological
beast is a little harsh,

24:41.090 --> 24:41.940
wouldn't you say?

24:44.020 --> 24:46.130
- [Greg] I would call that overkill, yeah.

24:46.130 --> 24:47.630
- Yeah, it's overkill.

24:47.630 --> 24:48.600
It's really overkill

24:48.600 --> 24:51.180
especially when you kill a man's humanity

24:51.180 --> 24:53.130
by turning him into some beast.

24:53.130 --> 24:55.070
Have you seen those lifeless eyes?

24:55.070 --> 24:59.130
- [Greg] So you actually
know his intrinsic character

24:59.130 --> 25:00.110
after one encounter?

25:00.110 --> 25:01.830
- I'm not talking about
his intrinsic character.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.820
I'm talking about his spirituality.

25:03.820 --> 25:07.160
The essence around him in that moment.

25:07.160 --> 25:10.210
I saw him. I looked him
dead in the eyes, Greg.

25:10.210 --> 25:12.490
And you know what I saw in there?

25:12.490 --> 25:14.380
Nothing that resembled a human

25:14.380 --> 25:16.750
except for the torn lab coat

25:16.750 --> 25:19.023
and once pinkish skin.

25:20.490 --> 25:21.323
- [Greg] Once.

25:21.323 --> 25:22.870
What does it look like now?

25:22.870 --> 25:26.340
- It's disfigured and torn.

25:26.340 --> 25:27.173
Like he was trying to

25:27.173 --> 25:29.290
claw his way out.
- So anybody who's not

25:29.290 --> 25:31.335
the same color as you
doesn't have humanity?

25:31.335 --> 25:32.168
- No, Greg.

25:32.168 --> 25:33.320
Don't make this about race.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.770
Don't make this about race.

25:34.770 --> 25:35.960
He is not a race.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.662
He is a creature, okay?

25:37.662 --> 25:40.026
- [Greg] It just sounds
kinda like you're saying

25:40.026 --> 25:42.760
people without my skin
color are like a creature.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.313
- Oh Jesus Christ, Greg.

25:45.359 --> 25:46.851
I don't wanna sound like one of those

25:46.851 --> 25:47.684
discontent people but--
- You have to be prepared

25:47.684 --> 25:49.857
for these kinda things, right?

25:49.857 --> 25:52.290
- I'm not racist, all right?

25:52.290 --> 25:54.050
I mean, eventually
we're gonna have to move

25:54.050 --> 25:55.850
beyond just posters, right?

25:55.850 --> 25:57.070
- [Greg] Sure.

25:57.070 --> 25:58.990
- I don't know much about
this whole documentary thing

25:58.990 --> 26:01.530
but do you think that Sundance might be...

26:01.530 --> 26:03.130
Wait, wait, wait.

26:03.130 --> 26:04.480
Wait, did you see that?

26:04.480 --> 26:05.682
- [Greg] See what?

26:05.682 --> 26:06.980
- [Darren] I mean, it was just a blur

26:06.980 --> 26:08.470
but it definitely looked like him.

26:08.470 --> 26:09.543
- [Greg] I can't see anything

26:09.543 --> 26:10.630
back there, man.
- It looked like

26:10.630 --> 26:12.920
Professor Zardonicus, Greg.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.010
- [Greg] What are you talking about?

26:14.010 --> 26:15.710
- I saw him go around that corner.

26:16.830 --> 26:17.663
- [Greg] Darren, you're not thinking

26:17.663 --> 26:18.496
about going back there?

26:18.496 --> 26:19.410
- Well yes, I'm thinking
about going back there.

26:19.410 --> 26:20.680
I just saw him!

26:20.680 --> 26:21.513
Plus, he's not gonna attack

26:21.513 --> 26:22.346
if there's two of us.
- Dude, look how sketchy

26:22.346 --> 26:23.611
that place is, man.

26:23.611 --> 26:24.460
What?

26:24.460 --> 26:26.690
- He won't attack if
there's two of us, Greg.

26:26.690 --> 26:28.350
- [Greg] Yeah, a guy with a gun might.

26:28.350 --> 26:30.600
So, maybe just call it a day.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.433
- Fine. Yeah.

26:31.433 --> 26:32.900
Let's call it a day, that'd be great,

26:32.900 --> 26:34.143
when we saw him just around the corner.

26:34.143 --> 26:35.118
I'm just...

26:35.118 --> 26:36.560
- [Greg] Darren?

26:36.560 --> 26:37.544
No fucking way.

26:37.544 --> 26:39.070
Darren!

26:39.070 --> 26:39.903
Darren!

26:40.770 --> 26:41.603
Fuck.

26:42.760 --> 26:43.593
Darren?

26:44.660 --> 26:45.940
Darren?

26:45.940 --> 26:46.773
Okay.

26:48.260 --> 26:49.630
Good.

26:49.630 --> 26:50.463
Calm down, calm down.

26:50.463 --> 26:52.079
He's gotta be here somewhere.

26:52.079 --> 26:53.218
Fuck.

26:53.218 --> 26:55.155
Just put the fucking switch on.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.317
- Hey.
- Darren, oh!

26:56.317 --> 26:57.467
- Did you see anything?

26:59.400 --> 27:00.400
- [Greg] What?

27:00.400 --> 27:01.563
- Did you see anything?

27:02.960 --> 27:03.880
- [Greg] No!

27:03.880 --> 27:05.400
- Shit.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.850
I didn't see anything either.

27:08.170 --> 27:09.749
It was definitely worth
a try though, right?

27:09.749 --> 27:11.430
(Darren chuckles)

27:11.430 --> 27:12.940
Right?

27:12.940 --> 27:14.130
- [Greg] Just...

27:14.130 --> 27:14.963
Can we go?

27:15.912 --> 27:17.665
- Well, yeah. I mean, sure.

27:17.665 --> 27:19.415
It's kinda creepy back here anyway.

27:22.539 --> 27:24.090
Are you coming or are you
just gonna stand there?

27:24.090 --> 27:24.923
- [Greg] Yeah, I'm coming.

27:24.923 --> 27:25.810
- Come on, let's go.

27:27.190 --> 27:28.470
Honestly, today was a little slow

27:28.470 --> 27:31.170
but tomorrow we're gonna
hit the ground running.

27:31.170 --> 27:34.240
The whole flyer thing, big waste of time.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.520
I say we go straight to the press.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.390
Go to the campus media outlets,

27:38.390 --> 27:39.694
see if we can't get some good--

27:39.694 --> 27:40.940
- Wait, Darren! I think I saw something!

27:40.940 --> 27:41.773
- What?

27:41.773 --> 27:44.190
- I don't know but I think
it went into the fountain.

27:44.190 --> 27:45.410
- The fountain, of course.

27:45.410 --> 27:46.736
That's the last place I'd think to look.

27:46.736 --> 27:47.710
- Exactly.
- Of course he'd go there.

27:47.710 --> 27:48.543
All right, come on.

27:48.543 --> 27:49.500
Start recording now.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.370
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Start recording, Greg!

27:51.370 --> 27:52.354
Come on!

27:52.354 --> 27:53.530
(soft music)

27:53.530 --> 27:54.363
- [Greg] Wait, wait.

27:54.363 --> 27:55.500
Sorry, I forgot my light.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.370
- You said he went in there?

27:56.370 --> 27:58.430
- [Greg] What? The fountain?

27:58.430 --> 27:59.600
Uh, yeah, yeah.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.490
- So Professor Zardonicus
might be aquatic.

28:02.490 --> 28:04.530
- [Greg] Uh, you know,
I'm not really too sure.

28:04.530 --> 28:05.993
- You know what? I am.

28:07.770 --> 28:08.770
- [Greg] Wait, Darren.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.541
You're not thinking of going in there.

28:10.541 --> 28:11.530
- No.

28:11.530 --> 28:13.100
I'm gonna lose Professor Zardonicus

28:13.100 --> 28:14.740
because I'm scared of a little water.

28:14.740 --> 28:15.990
What do you think, Greg?

28:15.990 --> 28:16.823
- [Greg] But wait, wait.

28:16.823 --> 28:17.656
We can't do that.

28:17.656 --> 28:18.748
No, no, wait, Darren, Darren!

28:18.748 --> 28:20.116
No, come back here. Darren!

28:20.116 --> 28:23.199
(tense guitar music)

28:52.590 --> 28:53.860
- So, I mean, at least tonight

28:53.860 --> 28:55.200
wasn't a complete waste, right?

28:55.200 --> 28:56.400
- [Greg] No, not at all.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.204
- Now we know Professor
Zardonicus is at least buoyant!

29:00.204 --> 29:02.785
- [Greg] He's extremely buoyant!

29:02.785 --> 29:03.618
- [Security] Come back here!

29:03.618 --> 29:04.451
- Oh shit!

29:04.451 --> 29:05.290
See?

29:05.290 --> 29:08.100
The campus doesn't wanna know the truth.

29:08.100 --> 29:08.933
Fuck you!

29:08.933 --> 29:10.660
(Greg laughs)

29:10.660 --> 29:12.142
- [Rachel] Wait, you made him do what?

29:12.142 --> 29:13.910
- Oh, I had to.

29:13.910 --> 29:15.140
I had to call his bluff, man,

29:15.140 --> 29:16.770
and he did it.

29:16.770 --> 29:18.040
- [Rachel] Wait, Greg,
you could've been caught,

29:18.040 --> 29:18.873
both of you.

29:18.873 --> 29:19.854
- Ah, but we weren't.

29:19.854 --> 29:21.450
- [Rachel] That's not...

29:21.450 --> 29:22.283
Whatever.

29:22.283 --> 29:23.170
- Fuck, this is cool.

29:23.170 --> 29:24.003
- [Rachel] Okay, wait.

29:24.003 --> 29:26.710
I'm having a really hard
time focusing on your face.

29:26.710 --> 29:28.589
- Well, just press the button.

29:28.589 --> 29:29.895
- [Rachel] Okay, yeah.

29:29.895 --> 29:31.047
- No, that button right there.

29:31.047 --> 29:31.880
No that's--

29:31.880 --> 29:34.480
- [Rachel] So, what's
the course of action?

29:34.480 --> 29:35.313
Like?

29:36.393 --> 29:39.043
Do you think he's dangerous?
- And he's in my movie.

29:40.455 --> 29:41.781
What'd you say?

29:41.781 --> 29:43.440
- [Rachel] I said do you
think he's dangerous?

29:43.440 --> 29:44.273
- Well, no.

29:44.273 --> 29:45.720
He's like...

29:45.720 --> 29:46.740
He's a littler pretentious

29:46.740 --> 29:48.393
but he's not gonna hurt anybody.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.187
- [Rachel] How long do you
think you can keep this up?

29:53.320 --> 29:55.210
- As long as he wants to.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.420
Could I get him to go on like public news?

29:58.420 --> 30:01.040
Could we set something
up like we're gonna--

30:01.040 --> 30:02.156
- [Rachel] Come back down to earth.

30:02.156 --> 30:03.130
Come over here. Sit down.

30:03.130 --> 30:04.396
- Why? It's cool.

30:04.396 --> 30:08.280
- [Rachel] Okay, real question, Greg.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.823
Do you actually know what you're doing?

30:14.130 --> 30:15.313
- Yeah, I'd say so.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.630
After confirming Darren's sincerity

30:18.630 --> 30:20.490
with the fountain incident,

30:20.490 --> 30:21.900
I began to wonder

30:21.900 --> 30:24.490
could he persuade people to his beliefs

30:24.490 --> 30:26.330
on conviction alone?

30:26.330 --> 30:28.000
Stranger things have happened

30:28.000 --> 30:29.850
and stranger beliefs have spread.

30:29.850 --> 30:32.280
Could Darren be sitting
on a potential cult

30:32.280 --> 30:33.850
akin to Heaven's Gate?

30:33.850 --> 30:35.740
However, our second day of activities

30:35.740 --> 30:37.350
proved that Darren's beliefs

30:37.350 --> 30:39.653
were not so contagious.

30:40.510 --> 30:41.343
- Let me tell you!

30:41.343 --> 30:43.363
Do not be afraid of those who can kill

30:43.363 --> 30:45.280
both the body and the soul!

30:45.280 --> 30:47.685
Matthew 10:28.

30:47.685 --> 30:50.580
Do not be afraid of those
who can kill the body

30:50.580 --> 30:52.704
but cannot kill the soul.
- Jesus.

30:52.704 --> 30:54.380
- [Greg] Literally.

30:54.380 --> 30:57.180
- [Darren] I mean, you have to
admire his tenacity, really.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.810
- [Greg] I don't know if I'd
call it tenacity, Darren.

30:59.810 --> 31:01.750
- He's out here defending his beliefs,

31:01.750 --> 31:03.638
no matter how controversial.

31:03.638 --> 31:04.800
What would you call it?

31:04.800 --> 31:07.840
I mean, he really reminds
me a little bit of...

31:07.840 --> 31:09.108
Wait.
- What?

31:09.108 --> 31:10.040
- Wait, wait.

31:10.040 --> 31:10.873
Follow my lead.

31:10.873 --> 31:11.706
- [Greg] Wait, Darren, no.

31:11.706 --> 31:12.830
Come on, don't do this.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.440
- Do you believe what I'm saying?

31:14.440 --> 31:16.600
Do you--
- Hold on. Hi.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.780
How's it going?

31:17.780 --> 31:18.613
- What is this?

31:18.613 --> 31:20.370
Are you trying to humiliate
me for my beliefs?

31:20.370 --> 31:21.203
- Well, no.

31:21.203 --> 31:22.170
No, no, no. Not at all.

31:22.170 --> 31:23.610
I respect what you're doing out here,

31:23.610 --> 31:25.140
standing up for your beliefs like that.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.700
- Don't patronize me.

31:26.700 --> 31:27.533
- No, no, no.

31:27.533 --> 31:28.500
I would not patronize you.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.683
I'm a fellow believer.

31:30.550 --> 31:32.060
- You're a fellow believer?

31:32.060 --> 31:33.913
- Well, yes. I do believe.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.600
- A college student

31:36.600 --> 31:38.459
who isn't a radical atheist.

31:38.459 --> 31:40.330
(laughs) All the proof of God that I need.

31:40.330 --> 31:42.435
(Darren laughs)

31:42.435 --> 31:43.780
(Darren clears throat)

31:43.780 --> 31:45.520
So what's with the camera?

31:45.520 --> 31:48.670
- Well, actually I was gonna get to that.

31:48.670 --> 31:49.503
I actually came over here

31:49.503 --> 31:50.973
to give you one of these.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.610
- I'm confused.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.120
Is this...

31:57.120 --> 31:58.650
Did your little brother draw this?

31:58.650 --> 31:59.741
- Well, no, that is...

31:59.741 --> 32:02.320
That's Professor Zardonicus, see?

32:02.320 --> 32:03.400
- Professor what?

32:03.400 --> 32:04.270
- Zardonicus.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.590
I think it might be a Hungarian name.

32:06.590 --> 32:08.060
My friend and I are actually out here

32:08.060 --> 32:09.400
trying to prove his existence.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.860
I was just wondering if you could,

32:10.860 --> 32:12.000
I don't know, keep an eye out,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.430
let us know if you see him.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.590
- I mean, this looks like a monster.

32:15.590 --> 32:16.930
- Well, he is.

32:16.930 --> 32:19.470
Not to put too fine a
point on it or anything,

32:19.470 --> 32:20.980
maybe a creature.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.577
Whatever the more
politically correct term is.

32:22.577 --> 32:23.760
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.410
You're trying to get me to believe

32:25.410 --> 32:26.710
in a damn monster?

32:26.710 --> 32:27.543
- Well, yeah.

32:27.543 --> 32:29.170
You're a believe, so believe.

32:29.170 --> 32:31.160
- I believe in the Lord!

32:31.160 --> 32:31.993
- Okay.

32:31.993 --> 32:32.900
So do I.

32:32.900 --> 32:33.733
Congratulations!

32:33.733 --> 32:35.440
I've scratched your
back. Now scratch mine.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.990
I think that's what
Christ would've wanted.

32:36.990 --> 32:38.580
- I'm not gonna support this insanity!

32:38.580 --> 32:40.292
Do I look like a lunatic to you?

32:40.292 --> 32:43.180
- No, you look like an
open-minded individual

32:43.180 --> 32:44.483
which is why I approached you

32:44.483 --> 32:45.316
in the first place.
- Will you just

32:45.316 --> 32:46.530
leave me alone?

32:46.530 --> 32:47.730
Just go!
- Why?

32:47.730 --> 32:48.563
- Go!

32:48.563 --> 32:49.800
Just leave me alone!
- You don't believe!

32:49.800 --> 32:51.132
- Darren, let's go.

32:51.132 --> 32:52.030
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

32:52.030 --> 32:53.470
- You believe in nothing.

32:53.470 --> 32:56.420
- [Greg] So, Darren, what
do you think went wrong?

32:56.420 --> 32:58.310
- Um, I don't know.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.550
It seemed like all the cards

33:00.550 --> 33:02.350
were stacked in our favor, you know?

33:03.610 --> 33:05.510
I approached a like-minded individual

33:05.510 --> 33:08.193
and I guess he didn't believe me.

33:09.716 --> 33:12.970
I thought he might relate
to what I was going through

33:12.970 --> 33:16.480
but even if he doesn't believe me,

33:16.480 --> 33:17.840
then who the hell will?

33:17.840 --> 33:19.250
- [Greg] Darren, you don't wanna relate

33:19.250 --> 33:20.270
to guys like him, right?

33:20.270 --> 33:22.743
I mean, nobody takes him seriously.

33:23.780 --> 33:26.077
- Greg, there's an old saying

33:26.077 --> 33:28.823
that goes beggars can't be choosers.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.550
You know who the beggar
is in this situation?

33:33.700 --> 33:35.313
'Cause it sure as hell isn't him.

33:41.700 --> 33:42.950
- [Greg] Hey, Darren,

33:42.950 --> 33:45.600
do you think it might be your approach?

33:45.600 --> 33:48.120
- Do I think what might be my approach?

33:48.120 --> 33:51.023
- [Greg] Why people might
not be resonating with you?

33:52.040 --> 33:54.200
- This is just how I am, Greg.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.040
- [Greg] Well, think of it this way.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.010
So you have regular Christians

33:57.010 --> 34:00.110
and then you have fundamentalist
Christians like that guy.

34:00.110 --> 34:02.520
Now, even though these people

34:02.520 --> 34:04.840
basically believe the same kinda stuff,

34:04.840 --> 34:06.940
one is accepted by society

34:06.940 --> 34:08.530
and the other isn't.

34:08.530 --> 34:10.706
So why do you think that is?

34:10.706 --> 34:12.450
- I mean, it could have something to do

34:12.450 --> 34:14.250
with the whole your mom's a whore

34:14.250 --> 34:15.860
and the church knows it signs.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.250
- [Greg] Well, the signs are indicative

34:17.250 --> 34:18.770
of a bigger problem though, right?

34:18.770 --> 34:20.090
They're too blunt.

34:20.090 --> 34:21.923
And I think you're kinda too blunt.

34:23.590 --> 34:24.583
- I'm too blunt?

34:25.810 --> 34:27.040
- [Greg] Well...

34:27.040 --> 34:29.400
So the priests that I had growing up,

34:29.400 --> 34:31.350
they had a certain way
of talking about things.

34:31.350 --> 34:33.200
Like they eased you into it.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.540
They didn't beat you over the head

34:34.540 --> 34:37.400
with this apocalyptic stuff.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.233
- Okay.

34:38.233 --> 34:41.120
So, I mean, what do I do?

34:41.120 --> 34:42.690
- [Greg] Well, you know,

34:42.690 --> 34:44.833
we could try a PR touch up.

34:45.990 --> 34:48.660
- But I wouldn't even know where to begin.

34:48.660 --> 34:49.493
- I would.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.270
While this wouldn't get us any closer

34:52.270 --> 34:54.380
to proving the existence
of Darren's monster,

34:54.380 --> 34:56.070
my curiosity compelled me

34:56.070 --> 34:59.470
to suggest something rather unorthodox

34:59.470 --> 35:02.005
which he thankfully accepted.

35:02.005 --> 35:04.320
- First, just let me say thank you so much

35:04.320 --> 35:05.610
for meeting with me, Father.

35:05.610 --> 35:06.443
- Absolutely.

35:06.443 --> 35:08.120
I'm always happy to talk.

35:08.120 --> 35:11.280
Especially when it's about
something urgent, as you put it.

35:11.280 --> 35:14.020
- Yes, I would say it's urgent.

35:14.020 --> 35:16.920
I was actually hoping to get some advice.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.980
- You know, it's not often
that someone your age

35:19.980 --> 35:22.200
comes to me for spiritual advice.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.670
It's...

35:23.670 --> 35:25.920
Honestly, it's quite touching for me.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.100
- Well, you know, it is spiritual

35:29.100 --> 35:31.810
but at the same time it isn't.

35:31.810 --> 35:33.640
You know what I mean?

35:33.640 --> 35:36.660
- No, I'm sorry. I don't follow.

35:36.660 --> 35:37.713
- Let me rephrase.

35:39.060 --> 35:42.740
I'm actually thinking of
becoming an ordained minister.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.270
- Oh.

35:44.270 --> 35:45.290
Well, that's wonderful.

35:45.290 --> 35:48.050
- Yeah, but I was hoping you could help me

35:48.050 --> 35:51.560
with the approach to the more
personable side of priesthood.

35:51.560 --> 35:52.393
- Personable?

35:53.600 --> 35:56.140
- Well, maybe I phrased it weird.

35:56.140 --> 35:57.770
What I meant was,

35:57.770 --> 36:00.040
when I preach the word,

36:00.040 --> 36:02.630
I'm met with scorn and mockery.

36:02.630 --> 36:04.290
- Oh, speak no more.

36:04.290 --> 36:07.480
Everybody in the church
is in the exact same boat.

36:07.480 --> 36:08.840
- Well, yeah, that's the thing though.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.770
You guys have a boat.

36:10.770 --> 36:12.840
I'm kind of floundering at sea here.

36:12.840 --> 36:16.533
I mean, how do you get your
word to resonate with people?

36:18.250 --> 36:21.243
- Well, that's a difficult
question because--

36:21.243 --> 36:22.670
- Oh, just a second.

36:22.670 --> 36:23.720
I brought a notebook.

36:25.204 --> 36:27.400
I'm gonna take some notes, you know.

36:27.400 --> 36:31.510
- Faith means different
things to different people.

36:31.510 --> 36:34.950
But I think it's also
important to keep in mind

36:34.950 --> 36:37.880
that you're asking people to take a leap

36:38.760 --> 36:41.230
and people don't leap out of fear.

36:41.230 --> 36:42.763
It only paralyzes them.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.560
It has to be for love.

36:46.560 --> 36:50.320
And you have to make people understand

36:50.320 --> 36:52.730
or to guide them to the understanding

36:52.730 --> 36:57.550
that to worship God and to accept Him,

36:57.550 --> 36:59.410
is to be loved.

36:59.410 --> 37:00.960
- That's amazing.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.960
That, really, that's fantastic.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.220
- Thank you.

37:04.220 --> 37:05.960
But it's also important to keep in mind

37:05.960 --> 37:07.690
that it's not just about faith--

37:07.690 --> 37:09.610
- How do you make people believe

37:09.610 --> 37:12.040
in the whole resurrection thing?

37:12.040 --> 37:14.340
That seems like kind of
a big pill to swallow.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.483
- Um. (stutters)

37:20.760 --> 37:22.680
- Wow. They really knew their stuff, huh?

37:22.680 --> 37:24.130
- What'd I tell you?

37:24.130 --> 37:26.160
- Look, I don't know what
to do with this information,

37:26.160 --> 37:27.740
but when I find out it's gonna be like,

37:27.740 --> 37:30.220
look out Professor, here I come!

37:30.220 --> 37:31.680
- Well, just follow the model, right?

37:31.680 --> 37:35.090
- Yeah but, I mean, where
am I gonna find my crowd?

37:35.090 --> 37:36.390
- [Greg] Wherever you can.

37:37.400 --> 37:41.261
The resulting solution was drastic

37:41.261 --> 37:42.883
to say the least.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.410
- That it does not cast their sunlight

37:46.410 --> 37:48.023
in the Garden of Eden.

37:49.859 --> 37:51.120
- [Greg] You nervous, Darren?

37:51.120 --> 37:52.380
- What?

37:52.380 --> 37:54.000
- [Greg] Just asking if you're nervous.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.310
- I mean, a little bit but, you know,

37:57.310 --> 37:59.800
I did theater in high school, so.

37:59.800 --> 38:00.633
- [Greg] Like what?

38:00.633 --> 38:03.201
- You know, "King Lear",
"Hamlet", "Macbeth", all the--

38:03.201 --> 38:04.034
- Shh!

38:06.690 --> 38:08.190
- What the fuck?

38:08.190 --> 38:09.980
- [Greg] You're not supposed to say

38:09.980 --> 38:11.367
the name of the play.

38:11.367 --> 38:12.390
- Superstitious much?

38:12.390 --> 38:13.223
All I said was "Macbeth".

38:13.223 --> 38:15.720
- [Greg] But there's a
curse around "Macbeth".

38:15.720 --> 38:16.553
That's the idea.

38:16.553 --> 38:17.960
That's why people get upset.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.478
- So, what? I shouldn't
say "Macbeth" anymore?

38:19.478 --> 38:20.395
- No.
- Shh!

38:21.416 --> 38:22.698
- Fine, I'll stop saying "Macbeth".

38:22.698 --> 38:23.740
Is that what you want?

38:23.740 --> 38:25.340
- [Greg] Just say the
Scottish play instead.

38:25.340 --> 38:26.371
- What?

38:26.371 --> 38:27.204
- [Greg] The Scottish play.

38:27.204 --> 38:28.680
Say that instead.
- I'm talking about "Macbeth".

38:28.680 --> 38:29.920
I'm not talking about a Scottish play.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.000
What are you talking about?

38:31.000 --> 38:35.890
- I say hate is the
ancient theme run afoul

38:35.890 --> 38:37.533
in mankind's passage.

38:38.510 --> 38:43.163
- [Greg] Darren, I'm having
second thoughts about this.

38:44.170 --> 38:45.500
- I'm the one that's
going out there on stage.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.749
You're just filming it.

38:46.749 --> 38:48.585
- [Greg] Yeah, I just...

38:48.585 --> 38:51.780
It seemed like an
interesting idea at the time

38:51.780 --> 38:54.990
but being here, I don't know
how you're gonna come across.

38:54.990 --> 38:56.791
- Come across?

38:56.791 --> 38:58.663
This audience right here?

38:59.940 --> 39:02.470
They're built around acceptance

39:02.470 --> 39:04.463
and never ending love.

39:05.340 --> 39:06.870
They want the truth to come out, right?

39:06.870 --> 39:07.830
I mean, that's what they're--

39:07.830 --> 39:08.820
- [Greg] When they're saying coming out

39:08.820 --> 39:10.180
they're talking about something different.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.013
- Listen, Greg.

39:11.013 --> 39:12.330
I think you're over analyzing this.

39:12.330 --> 39:14.697
These people are very
accepting, all right?

39:14.697 --> 39:17.670
They embrace everyone with open arms.

39:17.670 --> 39:19.430
They're gonna embrace a creature

39:19.430 --> 39:21.380
who's been locked away by society,

39:21.380 --> 39:23.190
who's been put in a corner,

39:23.190 --> 39:25.880
who's been seen as a monster.

39:25.880 --> 39:29.107
- Yet you force me to look away from you.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.277
(audience applauding)

39:32.277 --> 39:35.527
(Darren clears throat)

39:43.380 --> 39:45.300
- Hi, everyone.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.890
Thank you so much for coming out.

39:46.890 --> 39:49.260
My name is Darren.

39:49.260 --> 39:52.890
And I wanna share something
with you guys tonight.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.160
You see, because there's someone

39:55.160 --> 39:56.970
very near and dear to my heart

39:56.970 --> 39:59.190
that needs to come out to the world,

39:59.190 --> 40:02.644
that needs accepting people such as you.

40:02.644 --> 40:07.644
And of course, I'm talking
about Professor Zardonicus.

40:07.870 --> 40:09.100
Yes, that's right.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.090
Professor Zardonicus.

40:11.090 --> 40:16.090
The secret of this university
for the past 50 years.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.880
He has been the subject

40:17.880 --> 40:22.880
of cynicism and skepticism,
mockery, and scorn,

40:24.130 --> 40:26.180
because we've been misunderstanding him.

40:26.180 --> 40:28.160
Oh, we've been all wrong.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.120
You see, because Professor Zardonicus

40:30.120 --> 40:33.470
is not a creature who's driven by fear.

40:33.470 --> 40:36.460
But instead, driven by love.

40:36.460 --> 40:39.360
He needs us to find him

40:39.360 --> 40:42.180
because only by finding
Professor Zardonicus

40:42.180 --> 40:44.630
can we truly find ourselves.

40:44.630 --> 40:46.170
I'm here today to tell you

40:46.170 --> 40:49.670
that Professor Zardonicus has
only remained in the shadows

40:49.670 --> 40:52.270
because we have not made a space for him

40:52.270 --> 40:55.340
in our heart and souls.

40:55.340 --> 40:57.952
For the begotten are not the beloved.

40:57.952 --> 40:59.860
- Shut up!
- Because the beloved

40:59.860 --> 41:01.360
are those who believe

41:01.360 --> 41:03.108
in Professor Zardonicus.
- Boo!

41:03.108 --> 41:04.870
(audience jeering)
- Would you stop?

41:04.870 --> 41:06.210
I'm not done!

41:06.210 --> 41:07.453
I'm not done yet!

41:08.361 --> 41:09.680
I'm not done yet!

41:09.680 --> 41:11.186
I wasn't done!

41:11.186 --> 41:13.417
You're supposed to be accepting people!

41:13.417 --> 41:14.796
I wasn't done yet!

41:14.796 --> 41:16.530
I wasn't done yet.

41:16.530 --> 41:18.540
See, Greg? That's what happens!

41:18.540 --> 41:20.647
That's what happens when you
try to put yourself out there

41:20.647 --> 41:22.450
and get people to believe in something

41:22.450 --> 41:23.790
that hasn't been fucking programmed

41:23.790 --> 41:24.874
into their minds since birth!

41:24.874 --> 41:25.917
- [Greg] Darren, it's okay.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.750
- No, it's not okay, Greg!

41:27.750 --> 41:28.583
It's not okay!

41:28.583 --> 41:29.770
They kicked me off the stage.

41:29.770 --> 41:31.310
I had five fucking pages left

41:31.310 --> 41:32.330
and they kicked me off the stage

41:32.330 --> 41:33.620
like my opinion didn't matter!

41:33.620 --> 41:36.100
- [Greg] Maybe that's
because an LGBT poetry slam

41:36.100 --> 41:37.110
isn't the best platform--

41:37.110 --> 41:38.910
- That was your idea, Greg!

41:38.910 --> 41:40.470
That was your fucking idea!

41:40.470 --> 41:42.315
- [Greg] It was a joke.

41:42.315 --> 41:43.396
It was a joke!

41:43.396 --> 41:46.146
(Darren sobbing)

41:55.327 --> 41:57.177
- [Darren] I just don't get it, Greg.

41:58.718 --> 42:00.223
- [Greg] You don't get what?

42:08.166 --> 42:10.257
- Has it ever occurred to you

42:10.257 --> 42:12.836
that the right place and time

42:12.836 --> 42:15.586
is the only difference between
a mad man and a prophet?

42:19.820 --> 42:21.473
- [Greg] I don't know about that.

42:27.110 --> 42:29.060
- Professor Zardonicus deserves better.

42:32.990 --> 42:35.240
He deserves better than
these fucking people.

42:38.310 --> 42:39.143
- Okay.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.810
Upset as he was about
the poetry night debacle,

42:46.810 --> 42:48.480
Darren found that the event had in fact

42:48.480 --> 42:50.350
succeeded in raising his profile.

42:50.350 --> 42:51.500
So he was invited...

42:52.730 --> 42:55.590
Um, kinda doing something.

42:55.590 --> 42:57.030
- [Rachel] Are you ready to go?

42:57.030 --> 42:57.863
- To what?

42:58.830 --> 43:01.017
- [Rachel] To Mark's birthday party.

43:01.017 --> 43:02.430
Greg, you said we were gonna go.

43:02.430 --> 43:03.263
- Okay.

43:03.263 --> 43:04.100
I mean, you said you were gonna go.

43:04.100 --> 43:05.173
I said I was thinking about going.

43:05.173 --> 43:07.240
- [Rachel] Greg, I asked
you about this last week

43:07.240 --> 43:08.580
and you said yes.

43:08.580 --> 43:11.070
- Okay, I don't remember saying that, so.

43:11.070 --> 43:13.070
- [Rachel] God, what
is with you right now?

43:13.070 --> 43:13.903
It's happened three

43:13.903 --> 43:14.963
times this week.
- What's with me right now?

43:14.963 --> 43:16.660
Like, can you not see
what's with me right now?

43:16.660 --> 43:18.990
- [Rachel] Yes, and I can't
depend on you anymore.

43:18.990 --> 43:20.460
- You can't depend on me

43:20.460 --> 43:22.640
to go to a birthday party

43:22.640 --> 43:25.106
to a guy that I barely fucking know.

43:25.106 --> 43:25.939
- You're making commitments

43:25.939 --> 43:27.527
and then you're dropping
them and it makes me

43:27.527 --> 43:28.966
feel like shit.
- That's my commitment.

43:28.966 --> 43:30.510
That's my commitment.

43:30.510 --> 43:31.343
- Okay.

43:31.343 --> 43:32.176
- [Greg] Do you want
me to get an A or not?

43:32.176 --> 43:33.009
That's worth 25%

43:33.009 --> 43:34.595
of my final grade.
- So, what is this?

43:34.595 --> 43:35.428
- [Greg] What?

43:35.428 --> 43:37.170
- Is this not a commitment?

43:37.170 --> 43:38.580
This is your grade, okay, I get it.

43:38.580 --> 43:40.420
But what else, is it really helping you,

43:40.420 --> 43:43.540
this documentary, this
Professor Zardonicus bullshit?

43:43.540 --> 43:45.430
You're chasing a monster. It's not real.

43:45.430 --> 43:46.940
- Before I didn't work hard enough

43:46.940 --> 43:49.330
and now I word too hard.

43:49.330 --> 43:51.080
You can either complain about me--

43:51.080 --> 43:52.370
- Greg, that's work.
- Watching movies and

43:52.370 --> 43:53.750
playing video games all day

43:53.750 --> 43:54.759
or you can complain about me going

43:54.759 --> 43:55.592
not going to parties.
- This isn't work.

43:55.592 --> 43:56.425
What is this?

43:56.425 --> 43:57.422
You're talking about a monster

43:57.422 --> 43:58.903
that doesn't exist, Greg.
- You gotta choose one.

43:59.830 --> 44:02.760
This project exists.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.040
That should be good enough for you.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.090
It's good enough for me.

44:06.090 --> 44:07.893
So just go to the party.

44:09.410 --> 44:10.243
- Great.

44:11.987 --> 44:14.522
All right, it would be great
if you were there but--

44:14.522 --> 44:16.318
- Yeah, whatever.

44:16.318 --> 44:18.493
- [Rachel] All right.

44:18.493 --> 44:20.010
- Tell Mark I said hi.

44:20.010 --> 44:20.843
- [Rachel] Sure.

44:24.603 --> 44:25.436
- Fuck.

44:34.507 --> 44:37.590
(Greg clears throat)

44:40.110 --> 44:42.140
After Darren's video went viral,

44:42.140 --> 44:45.130
he was invited to an interview

44:45.130 --> 44:47.950
at the official university radio station

44:47.950 --> 44:51.250
and the results were to be expected.

44:51.250 --> 44:52.083
- All right, everybody.

44:52.083 --> 44:53.100
Welcome back to the show.

44:53.100 --> 44:54.570
You know what station you're at.

44:54.570 --> 44:56.280
It's your host, Keegan Michaels,

44:56.280 --> 44:58.250
bringing you the latest campus news.

44:58.250 --> 45:01.621
Joining me is a very special guest.

45:01.621 --> 45:03.560
You know that one weird dude

45:03.560 --> 45:05.410
who crashed the poetry slam?

45:05.410 --> 45:09.360
It's our university's
very own Darren Mitchell.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.300
Darren, how are you doing today?

45:11.300 --> 45:12.600
- Well, I'm doing all right, Keegan.

45:12.600 --> 45:13.540
Thank you for asking.

45:13.540 --> 45:14.940
- It's customary.

45:14.940 --> 45:16.810
What I really wanted to know and get to

45:16.810 --> 45:18.830
was more along the lines of

45:18.830 --> 45:21.110
what the hell were you
thinking that night?

45:21.110 --> 45:23.610
- Um, well. (clears throat)

45:23.610 --> 45:26.170
You see, that was a night of expression

45:27.020 --> 45:29.670
and I got up on that
stage to express myself.

45:29.670 --> 45:32.350
- No, everybody else was
expressing themselves.

45:32.350 --> 45:34.480
What you did was you stole the spotlight

45:34.480 --> 45:37.110
away from people who were
sharing their experiences

45:37.110 --> 45:40.570
as members of the LGBT community

45:40.570 --> 45:42.470
to talk some bullshit about a monster.

45:42.470 --> 45:46.570
- Well, okay, Professor
Zardonicus is not a monster.

45:46.570 --> 45:48.440
Hitler was a monster.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.110
Would you compare the victim

45:50.110 --> 45:53.056
of a horrific prank to Adolf Hitler?

45:53.056 --> 45:53.889
(Keegan sighs)

45:53.889 --> 45:54.810
- Okay.

45:54.810 --> 45:57.030
You are a grown ass man.
- I am.

45:57.030 --> 45:58.890
- A student of this university

45:58.890 --> 46:01.950
who would rather choose to spend his time

46:01.950 --> 46:03.840
talking about the Boogie Man.

46:03.840 --> 46:06.700
- Yes, because there are
just so many similarities

46:06.700 --> 46:09.670
between the Boogie Man and
Professor Zardonicus, right?

46:09.670 --> 46:12.890
- Which are figments of
your imagination, so.

46:12.890 --> 46:14.290
- Tell me something, Keegan.

46:15.420 --> 46:18.620
Have you ever met your
great great grandfather?

46:18.620 --> 46:19.880
- Um--
- Let me stop you right there.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.320
You haven't.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.860
Does that make him a
figment of your imagination?

46:23.860 --> 46:25.570
Does that make him not real?

46:25.570 --> 46:27.870
- Darren, the fact that
we have a cameraman

46:27.870 --> 46:30.840
recording this whole thing
clearly makes it obvious

46:30.840 --> 46:32.500
that you're just looking for attention.

46:32.500 --> 46:35.640
- Well, you're the one with
a radio station, Keegan.

46:35.640 --> 46:37.430
Are you just looking for attention?

46:37.430 --> 46:39.530
- No, I'm looking for a story.

46:39.530 --> 46:40.890
- So am I.

46:40.890 --> 46:43.200
Just because my story doesn't align

46:43.200 --> 46:45.050
with societal norms,

46:45.050 --> 46:47.080
doesn't mean that it's not worth telling

46:47.080 --> 46:48.393
or that it's not true.

46:50.488 --> 46:52.810
- Let's go to our student body.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.980
Everyone, I want you to call in

46:54.980 --> 46:57.030
and tell me what you think on the matter.

46:57.960 --> 46:59.680
You're on the air with Keegan.

46:59.680 --> 47:01.010
To whom am I speaking?

47:01.010 --> 47:03.440
- [Casey] Hi, Keegan. My name is Casey.

47:03.440 --> 47:04.770
I'm a junior.

47:04.770 --> 47:06.780
- Nice to be talking to you, Casey.

47:06.780 --> 47:09.590
Tell me, what are your thoughts
about this whole thing?

47:09.590 --> 47:11.560
- [Casey] Well, let's give
the benefit of the doubt

47:11.560 --> 47:15.000
and say this guy really believes
in Professor Zardonicus.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.940
What I have to ask is
how is what you're doing

47:17.940 --> 47:19.680
even getting closer to proving that?

47:19.680 --> 47:22.120
- You don't think I'm
doing a good job, Casey?

47:22.120 --> 47:24.740
- [Casey] I don't even think
you're trying, honestly.

47:24.740 --> 47:26.480
All you do is harass people

47:26.480 --> 47:29.280
and you expect us to
take you on your word?

47:29.280 --> 47:31.140
- How am I harassing people?

47:31.140 --> 47:33.240
I am out there spreading the word

47:33.240 --> 47:35.020
about Professor Zardonicus.

47:35.020 --> 47:37.930
I am making people aware of a creature

47:37.930 --> 47:40.220
that stalks this campus.

47:40.220 --> 47:41.750
If people are aware,

47:41.750 --> 47:43.443
they can find him.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.730
I don't know how else to
explain this to you, Casey.

47:46.730 --> 47:48.170
How am I not coming across?

47:48.170 --> 47:50.170
- [Casey] Honestly, I
think you're just dodging.

47:50.170 --> 47:51.458
I think you're not going after him

47:51.458 --> 47:53.150
because, like the guy said,

47:53.150 --> 47:56.220
you want attention more
than you want this truth.

47:56.220 --> 47:57.490
Why aren't you going out there

47:57.490 --> 47:59.227
and really trying to find this thing?

47:59.227 --> 48:01.440
And why don't you find other witnesses?

48:01.440 --> 48:04.300
There has to be somebody
else who's seen this thing.

48:04.300 --> 48:06.670
Can you say that you have actually gotten

48:06.670 --> 48:08.683
any closer to proving that he's real?

48:11.350 --> 48:13.360
- [Keegan] Got anything to say, Darren?

48:13.360 --> 48:14.995
- I mean, um,

48:14.995 --> 48:19.800
there's just the fact that he's, uh...

48:21.207 --> 48:22.040
(Keegan laughs)

48:22.040 --> 48:23.940
- [Keegan] I think you got him, Casey.

48:27.850 --> 48:29.460
- So, update.

48:29.460 --> 48:31.280
Darren has asked me to come out here

48:31.280 --> 48:34.090
and meet him the middle of the woods.

48:34.090 --> 48:37.400
Which will surely not
end in my violent murder.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.150
Yeah, so my car broke down

48:39.150 --> 48:40.500
and now I'm being driven by

48:40.500 --> 48:43.025
the lovely and beautiful Rachel Patten.

48:43.025 --> 48:44.183
- Shut up.

48:44.183 --> 48:45.747
- Okay.

48:45.747 --> 48:46.580
Anyways.

48:46.580 --> 48:48.450
- This is a really bad idea, by the way.

48:48.450 --> 48:49.460
- You said that part.

48:49.460 --> 48:51.110
Since the radio interview

48:51.110 --> 48:52.770
Darren has not been doing so well.

48:52.770 --> 48:54.770
He has withdrawn even from me

48:54.770 --> 48:58.253
and I don't think he talks
to anybody else, honestly.

48:59.970 --> 49:01.340
He only invites me over now

49:01.340 --> 49:02.980
so I can record random footage

49:02.980 --> 49:04.990
of him researching stuff on his laptop

49:04.990 --> 49:06.800
and, I don't know,

49:06.800 --> 49:08.395
like staring out the window.

49:08.395 --> 49:10.420
- [Rachel] That's a lot of progress.

49:10.420 --> 49:12.760
- Well, at least today he said

49:12.760 --> 49:14.880
that something big was gonna go down.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.128
And I don't think he would hype it up

49:16.128 --> 49:18.067
without something to show for it.

49:18.067 --> 49:22.320
- Something to show for
it as in your death?

49:22.320 --> 49:23.290
From what you've talked about, Greg,

49:23.290 --> 49:26.370
it sounds like he has issues.

49:26.370 --> 49:29.163
Like real, real issues.

49:30.470 --> 49:32.590
- He's kind of out there

49:32.590 --> 49:34.020
and he's a little forward.

49:34.020 --> 49:35.457
- He's kind of out there?

49:35.457 --> 49:36.760
- He's, okay--
- Greg.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.157
- I don't know if he's insane,

49:38.157 --> 49:38.990
if that's what you're getting at.

49:38.990 --> 49:42.010
- You don't know anything about him, Greg.

49:42.010 --> 49:43.720
You don't know where he came from,

49:43.720 --> 49:44.890
about his parents.

49:44.890 --> 49:48.580
You have no idea about anything.

49:48.580 --> 49:51.390
- I know he's not dangerous, okay?

49:51.390 --> 49:52.573
And that's like the
important thing, right?

49:52.573 --> 49:54.773
- I'm not talking about
him being dangerous.

49:55.950 --> 49:57.163
- Then what are you talking about?

49:57.163 --> 49:57.996
- I...

49:59.000 --> 50:01.571
It sounds like you're
taking advantage of him.

50:01.571 --> 50:02.871
- Taking advantage of him?

50:04.620 --> 50:06.738
What, like he's not
taking advantage of me?

50:06.738 --> 50:08.073
- Shut up, Greg.

50:09.138 --> 50:09.971
- Okay.

50:11.370 --> 50:12.393
- If I were you,

50:13.260 --> 50:16.090
I would at least try to figure out

50:17.140 --> 50:18.540
what it is I'm dealing with.

50:20.430 --> 50:22.770
- How would you approach that?

50:22.770 --> 50:24.314
- I don't know, Greg.

50:24.314 --> 50:26.243
You're the one making a documentary.

50:31.593 --> 50:34.392
(Greg sighs)

50:34.392 --> 50:35.946
This is it.

50:35.946 --> 50:37.696
- [Greg] There he is.

50:39.263 --> 50:40.750
- Hey, hey, guys.

50:40.750 --> 50:42.100
Glad you could make it
all the way out here.

50:42.100 --> 50:43.604
- Yeah.
- Absolutely, man.

50:43.604 --> 50:44.810
- [Rachel] We haven't actually met.

50:44.810 --> 50:46.270
I'm Rachel, Greg's girlfriend.

50:46.270 --> 50:47.883
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.790
Thank you for letting
me steal him away again.

50:50.790 --> 50:53.280
- Yeah, just make sure
you bring him home alive.

50:53.280 --> 50:54.745
It's his turn to do the dishes tonight.

50:54.745 --> 50:55.874
(Darren laughs)
- Oh, come on.

50:55.874 --> 50:57.663
You know I'm not gonna do the dishes.

50:58.580 --> 50:59.670
- Yeah, we're just,

50:59.670 --> 51:00.503
we're just gonna hang out.

51:00.503 --> 51:02.750
You know, maybe uncover the existence

51:02.750 --> 51:05.650
of some humanoid type create, right, Greg?

51:05.650 --> 51:06.483
- [Greg] Yeah!

51:07.900 --> 51:09.040
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.201
- [Greg] Well, yeah,
thanks for the ride, babe.

51:10.201 --> 51:11.800
- Get to it. Of course.
- Yeah, thanks, babe.

51:11.800 --> 51:12.680
Thank you.

51:12.680 --> 51:13.513
Thank you.

51:13.513 --> 51:15.360
(Darren and Rachel laugh nervously)

51:15.360 --> 51:16.713
She was pretty nice.

51:17.898 --> 51:19.083
Rachel, I mean.

51:20.180 --> 51:21.610
- [Greg] Yeah, I would say so.

51:21.610 --> 51:23.783
- How long have you two been going out?

51:25.260 --> 51:26.630
- [Greg] I guess it's
been about three years.

51:26.630 --> 51:29.340
We started dating back
when we were freshmen, so.

51:29.340 --> 51:30.470
- Nice.

51:30.470 --> 51:31.303
Nice.

51:31.303 --> 51:33.540
You know, I didn't wanna
say anything back there

51:33.540 --> 51:37.133
but uh, my last girlfriend
was actually named Rachel.

51:38.650 --> 51:39.730
- [Greg] Oh yeah?

51:39.730 --> 51:40.563
- Yeah.

51:40.563 --> 51:41.740
I wish I had more to say about her

51:41.740 --> 51:43.913
but, uh, that's about it.

51:44.972 --> 51:46.670
- [Greg] Why? It didn't end very well?

51:46.670 --> 51:49.100
- I mean, relatively to what?
The Hindenburg disaster?

51:49.100 --> 51:49.933
(chuckles)

51:49.933 --> 51:52.023
No, I think it was okay compared to that.

51:53.018 --> 51:54.412
- [Greg] Well, if you
don't mind my asking,

51:54.412 --> 51:55.323
what happened?

51:57.190 --> 51:59.320
- You know, the normal relationship stuff.

51:59.320 --> 52:02.650
She says she wants honesty and openness,

52:02.650 --> 52:04.723
that she wants to know the truth.

52:04.723 --> 52:06.800
But when I try to tell her the truth...

52:10.452 --> 52:13.333
It's not always easy
getting what you want, Greg.

52:16.190 --> 52:19.937
- [Greg] Was this truth
Professor Zardonicus related?

52:19.937 --> 52:22.540
(Darren sighs)

52:22.540 --> 52:23.892
- Yeah.

52:23.892 --> 52:24.725
It was.

52:25.660 --> 52:26.493
- [Greg] Oh.

52:27.530 --> 52:29.020
Uh, Darren?

52:29.020 --> 52:30.190
How much further do we got?

52:30.190 --> 52:31.977
- [Darren] Not much further, honestly.

52:31.977 --> 52:33.560
- [Greg] You said that last time though.

52:33.560 --> 52:36.010
- [Darren] Okay, well time
is a subjective thing, Greg.

52:36.010 --> 52:37.170
I don't know what you want me to say.

52:37.170 --> 52:38.003
- [Greg] That's your answer?

52:38.003 --> 52:39.080
That time is subjective?

52:39.080 --> 52:39.913
- Yes.

52:39.913 --> 52:41.250
- [Greg] No, we have clocks, Darren.

52:41.250 --> 52:42.420
They measure time.

52:42.420 --> 52:45.260
- Okay, look, it's just a
little bit further, I promise.

52:45.260 --> 52:46.730
Now, please, can we just keep moving?

52:46.730 --> 52:48.120
There's thorns in this part.

52:48.120 --> 52:49.540
- [Greg] Yeah, uh, look.

52:49.540 --> 52:50.797
I didn't really sign up for this

52:50.797 --> 52:52.210
"Blair Witch" shit, all right?

52:52.210 --> 52:53.480
- [Darren] I don't know what that is.

52:53.480 --> 52:54.313
- [Greg] What?

52:54.313 --> 52:55.907
- You watched in like
film class or something?

52:55.907 --> 52:57.487
- [Greg] No, it's iconic, Darren.

52:57.487 --> 52:59.730
What are you talking about?

52:59.730 --> 53:00.980
- Well, it's not that iconic.

53:00.980 --> 53:02.390
I haven't heard of it.

53:02.390 --> 53:04.410
- [Greg] Oh, what? You're a connoisseur?

53:04.410 --> 53:06.450
You're the fucking arbiter of culture?

53:06.450 --> 53:08.180
- [Darren] I don't know what
you're trying to say, Greg,

53:08.180 --> 53:09.490
but I haven't seen that movie

53:09.490 --> 53:11.424
so it must not be very good.

53:11.424 --> 53:13.270
(Darren grunts)

53:13.270 --> 53:14.260
- [Greg] You good?

53:14.260 --> 53:15.520
- Yeah, come on.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.353
- [Greg] Okay.

53:17.481 --> 53:18.314
Goddammit.

53:18.314 --> 53:19.620
Do you even know where we're going?

53:19.620 --> 53:20.810
- Of course I know where we're going.

53:20.810 --> 53:22.980
We gotta take a right up here.

53:22.980 --> 53:24.287
Take a right.

53:24.287 --> 53:26.100
- [Greg] That's going straight.

53:26.100 --> 53:27.520
You're going straight.

53:27.520 --> 53:29.129
- Straight to the right.

53:29.129 --> 53:31.795
You gotta climb--
- The fuck are you doing?

53:31.795 --> 53:33.593
Whoa, are you okay?
- Don't fall.

53:33.593 --> 53:34.930
Don't fall like me, Greg.

53:34.930 --> 53:35.763
There's thorns everywhere.

53:35.763 --> 53:37.350
- [Greg] Why are you climbing a tree?

53:37.350 --> 53:39.750
Okay, Darren, can we
just stop for a second?

53:39.750 --> 53:41.750
- Stop? We can't stop, Greg.

53:41.750 --> 53:43.960
It's gonna get dark if we don't hurry up.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.969
- [Greg] I'm just getting
a little overwhelmed.

53:45.969 --> 53:47.967
There's a lot of mosquitoes.
- It's fine.

53:47.967 --> 53:50.170
Just follow me.
- A lot of branches.

53:50.170 --> 53:52.210
A lot of shit around.
- Greg.

53:52.210 --> 53:53.260
Follow me.

53:53.260 --> 53:54.640
We're gonna take a right up ahead

53:54.640 --> 53:56.510
and everything's gonna be fine.

53:56.510 --> 53:57.343
Just come on.

53:59.390 --> 54:00.683
- [Greg] Fuck. Okay.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.320
- Watch out.

54:03.320 --> 54:04.710
Bear hole.

54:04.710 --> 54:05.630
- [Greg] What?

54:05.630 --> 54:07.000
- Bears dig holes like that.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.150
They keep their young in them.

54:09.150 --> 54:10.440
- [Greg] Darren, how
much do you actually know

54:10.440 --> 54:11.350
about wildlife?

54:11.350 --> 54:12.710
- I know quite a bit.

54:12.710 --> 54:14.770
I've read quite a few books on bears.

54:14.770 --> 54:15.640
- [Greg] Did you say you've written

54:15.640 --> 54:16.960
quite a few books on bears?

54:16.960 --> 54:17.793
- Read.

54:17.793 --> 54:20.390
- [Greg] You totally
fucking said you wrote them.

54:20.390 --> 54:21.830
- I said I've written, Greg?

54:21.830 --> 54:22.698
Learn to speak before you--
- You said you written--

54:22.698 --> 54:24.698
- Accuse me.
- Shut the fuck up and go.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.893
- [Darren] Hey, why'd you stop recording?

54:29.890 --> 54:31.490
- Because I'm tired.

54:31.490 --> 54:32.980
- [Darren] Well, yeah,
I'm tired too, Greg.

54:32.980 --> 54:35.020
But that doesn't mean you stop recording.

54:35.020 --> 54:37.310
We're on the search for the truth here.

54:37.310 --> 54:38.820
Of course it's gonna be tiring work.

54:38.820 --> 54:39.687
I mean, we've been walking around for--

54:39.687 --> 54:41.743
- You know, I have a test coming up

54:41.743 --> 54:43.290
that I could be studying for?

54:43.290 --> 54:45.440
- [Darren] Oh, I'm sorry. You have a test.

54:45.440 --> 54:46.770
I didn't realize that was more important

54:46.770 --> 54:48.228
than the life and safety

54:48.228 --> 54:49.540
of people on our campus.
- Yeah instead of studying

54:49.540 --> 54:51.920
I'm out here lost in the
middle of the woods with you.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.600
- [Darren] Okay, we're not lost, Greg.

54:53.600 --> 54:54.490
I told you that.
- Yes, we are.

54:54.490 --> 54:56.260
- We are not lost.
- Yes, we are!

54:56.260 --> 54:57.280
- [Darren] We took a right

54:57.280 --> 54:58.760
when we should've taken a left.

54:58.760 --> 54:59.909
- What the fuck does that mean?

54:59.909 --> 55:00.742
We're in the woods!
- That means that

55:00.742 --> 55:01.840
we're not lost.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.710
Do you know who's really lost, Greg?

55:03.710 --> 55:04.543
- Don't say it.

55:04.543 --> 55:05.590
Don't fucking. No.
- The real lost people--

55:05.590 --> 55:06.878
- No, not this shit.
- Are the people

55:06.878 --> 55:09.240
that don't believe in
Professor Zardonicus.

55:09.240 --> 55:11.350
The truth that's right
there in front of them.

55:11.350 --> 55:13.970
The monster that's been
living on their campus

55:13.970 --> 55:14.890
right under their noses

55:14.890 --> 55:17.327
and they can't see it.
- Rachel was right.

55:17.327 --> 55:18.851
How about that?

55:18.851 --> 55:19.684
- [Darren] What does that even...

55:19.684 --> 55:20.517
What do you mean

55:20.517 --> 55:22.480
Rachel was right?
- Figure it out, smart guy.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.160
- [Darren] What'd she say about me, Greg?

55:24.160 --> 55:25.573
What are you doing? Stop!

55:25.573 --> 55:26.406
- What?

55:27.390 --> 55:28.223
- [Darren] Why are you doing that?

55:28.223 --> 55:29.110
You don't need your phone right now.

55:29.110 --> 55:30.997
You need your camera so we can film.

55:30.997 --> 55:33.140
- No, I need my phone
to call my girlfriend

55:33.140 --> 55:35.090
so she can pick me up
and get me out of here.

55:35.090 --> 55:36.570
- [Darren] We're not done, Greg.

55:36.570 --> 55:38.177
- I am. Yeah.
- You're done?

55:38.177 --> 55:39.682
- I'm done with this whole
fucking thing actually.

55:39.682 --> 55:40.710
- [Darren] Oh, so you're
just, you're leaving?

55:40.710 --> 55:41.760
Is that what this is?
- Yes, I am.

55:41.760 --> 55:43.370
Yeah.
- Fine, you can leave

55:43.370 --> 55:44.758
but I'm keeping this, all right?

55:44.758 --> 55:45.591
- [Greg] What?

55:45.591 --> 55:46.485
- I'm keeping this camera.
- Wait, hold on.

55:46.485 --> 55:47.318
Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

55:47.318 --> 55:48.250
- Give me back my fucking camera!

55:48.250 --> 55:50.063
- This is my truth. Get back!

55:50.960 --> 55:52.353
Get back or I will drop it.

55:54.770 --> 55:56.733
This is my truth, Greg.

55:57.590 --> 55:59.140
You wanna leave? Fine.

55:59.140 --> 56:00.370
- Fuck.
- You leave,

56:00.370 --> 56:02.150
you go find another subject,

56:02.150 --> 56:04.780
and then you can go
back to your little life

56:04.780 --> 56:06.230
making little videos

56:06.230 --> 56:08.133
while everyone you know passes you by.

56:11.710 --> 56:12.543
- That was...

56:13.810 --> 56:14.643
Fuck.

56:14.643 --> 56:16.870
- [Darren] That was,
what, the truth, Greg?

56:16.870 --> 56:18.663
But you're not gonna do that, hmm?

56:19.586 --> 56:21.010
You're not gonna give up

56:21.010 --> 56:24.200
because we are this close
to finding something

56:24.200 --> 56:28.410
that no one else has
even come close to, Greg.

56:28.410 --> 56:30.374
We're this close to discovering the truth

56:30.374 --> 56:32.490
and you wanna give up 'cause you're tired,

56:32.490 --> 56:33.883
because your feet hurt?

56:35.320 --> 56:36.153
Guess what, Greg?

56:36.153 --> 56:37.150
The truth doesn't come easy

56:37.150 --> 56:38.360
and you could have all the glory

56:38.360 --> 56:40.410
if you would just walk five more minutes!

56:47.700 --> 56:48.533
- Okay.

56:49.630 --> 56:50.790
- [Darren] Okay?

56:50.790 --> 56:52.970
- That's what I said, yes.

56:52.970 --> 56:53.803
Fuck.

56:53.803 --> 56:54.760
- [Darren] Well, stop moping around

56:54.760 --> 56:56.177
and take your camera.
- I'm not moping.

56:56.177 --> 56:57.415
Give me my camera.

56:57.415 --> 56:58.680
Do you even know how to use a camera?

56:58.680 --> 57:00.130
- Watch your step.
- I know.

57:01.380 --> 57:02.790
- There it is.
- What?

57:02.790 --> 57:04.791
- It's actually here. (laughs)

57:04.791 --> 57:06.060
- [Greg] What?

57:06.060 --> 57:08.100
That's what we were looking for?

57:08.100 --> 57:09.451
A fucking truck in the
middle of the woods?

57:09.451 --> 57:10.284
- No, no, no, no.

57:10.284 --> 57:11.870
That's what we found.

57:11.870 --> 57:14.120
We found a truck in the
middle of the woods, Greg.

57:14.120 --> 57:15.290
Come on.

57:15.290 --> 57:16.960
Mr. Kint!

57:16.960 --> 57:17.923
Mr. Kint!

57:20.190 --> 57:21.800
Um, Mr. Kint?

57:21.800 --> 57:23.060
- [Greg] Uh, Darren, does he--

57:23.060 --> 57:23.950
- Hey! Hey!

57:23.950 --> 57:25.730
What the hell are you--
- Oh no, Mr. Kint.

57:25.730 --> 57:26.563
Mr. Kint!

57:27.420 --> 57:28.947
I'm Darren. We spoke.

57:28.947 --> 57:32.160
- Wait, you're that kid?

57:32.160 --> 57:35.680
- [Darren] Yeah, you said I
could come out to your house.

57:35.680 --> 57:38.030
- Well, I didn't expect
for you to actually show.

57:38.030 --> 57:39.130
Jesus, kid.

57:39.130 --> 57:40.000
What the hell is this?

57:40.000 --> 57:41.840
What, you making a movie or something?

57:41.840 --> 57:42.673
- Oh, no, no.

57:42.673 --> 57:44.160
This is a documentary.

57:44.160 --> 57:46.020
I thought I mentioned it to you.

57:46.020 --> 57:47.890
- A documentary?

57:47.890 --> 57:49.580
Well, I don't know what
sorry son of a bitch

57:49.580 --> 57:51.070
would sign up for this.

57:51.070 --> 57:51.903
- [Greg] It's okay, sir.

57:51.903 --> 57:53.723
I'm getting school credit for this.

57:54.640 --> 57:56.483
- Jesus fucking Christ.

57:58.430 --> 57:59.900
Kids would suck their own dicks

57:59.900 --> 58:02.470
for school credit these days.

58:02.470 --> 58:03.700
All right, don't just stand there

58:03.700 --> 58:04.800
with your thumbs up your ass.

58:04.800 --> 58:06.733
Come on. Let's do this thing.

58:07.870 --> 58:08.703
- [Greg] Darren.

58:08.703 --> 58:09.536
- What?

58:09.536 --> 58:11.220
- [Greg] What the fuck
have you gotten us into?

58:11.220 --> 58:12.100
- What I've gotten us into?

58:12.100 --> 58:13.370
I've gotten us Herb.

58:13.370 --> 58:14.203
What do you mean what have I

58:14.203 --> 58:15.036
gotten us into?
- Who is Herb?

58:15.036 --> 58:16.190
How did you even find him?

58:16.190 --> 58:18.130
- Um, it's called the internet, Greg.

58:18.130 --> 58:18.963
Have you heard of it?

58:18.963 --> 58:22.720
- So, what did you have in mind, kid?

58:22.720 --> 58:26.420
- Oh, just a typical interview.

58:26.420 --> 58:29.370
Maybe those two chairs
over there somewhere.

58:29.370 --> 58:30.220
- All right.

58:30.220 --> 58:31.783
- [Darren] Yeah, that'd
be great. Thank you.

58:33.690 --> 58:34.810
- Darren?
- Yeah?

58:34.810 --> 58:36.390
- [Greg] I know you're not a film student,

58:36.390 --> 58:38.150
but how are you gonna do an interview

58:38.150 --> 58:39.710
with only one camera?

58:39.710 --> 58:41.040
- Oh, that's the thing, Greg.

58:41.040 --> 58:43.650
We don't just have one camera. (laughs)

58:43.650 --> 58:45.110
- Dude.

58:45.110 --> 58:46.210
You had a camera this whole fucking...

58:46.210 --> 58:47.400
You were gonna steal mine.

58:47.400 --> 58:49.120
- [Darren] Well yeah, you
can't do a proper interview

58:49.120 --> 58:50.120
with only one camera.

58:50.120 --> 58:53.110
You have to get my reaction
and Herb's reaction.

58:53.110 --> 58:54.170
You're a film student, Greg.

58:54.170 --> 58:55.270
You should know this.

58:55.270 --> 58:56.740
- Just tell me who this guy is.

58:56.740 --> 58:58.410
- Oh, that guy, Herb?
- Yes.

58:58.410 --> 58:59.650
- Oh, no.

58:59.650 --> 59:00.483
He's no one big.

59:00.483 --> 59:02.770
I mean, (chuckles), not a big deal really.

59:02.770 --> 59:04.220
He's just, you know,

59:04.220 --> 59:09.220
the only other documented
witness of Professor Zardonicus.

59:09.230 --> 59:11.620
- [Greg] Whoa. That guy?

59:11.620 --> 59:13.133
- [Darren] Yeah. That guy.

59:14.250 --> 59:15.083
- Really?

59:18.470 --> 59:19.660
Okay, let's do it then.

59:21.400 --> 59:22.780
- How's it going, Greg?

59:22.780 --> 59:24.510
- We're good. Okay.
- Good.

59:24.510 --> 59:25.343
All right. Good.

59:25.343 --> 59:26.540
And the cameras are already rolling?

59:26.540 --> 59:29.040
- Yeah.
- All right, Herb,

59:29.040 --> 59:30.510
how are you doing?

59:30.510 --> 59:33.383
- Well, um, I'm all right.

59:34.737 --> 59:36.880
(chuckles) It's just I
haven't talked about this

59:36.880 --> 59:38.980
in, what, 30 years.

59:38.980 --> 59:40.179
- That's all right. You're gonna do fine.

59:40.179 --> 59:44.130
Just let's start by having
you introduce yourself.

59:44.130 --> 59:45.133
- Uh, okay.

59:46.150 --> 59:47.863
Well, I'm Herbert Kint.

59:49.270 --> 59:51.420
I'm a freelance musician.

59:51.420 --> 59:52.253
- Oh.

59:53.120 --> 59:53.953
That's great.

59:53.953 --> 59:55.930
I didn't know you were
a freelance musician.

59:55.930 --> 59:57.580
Maybe you could play something for us.

59:57.580 --> 59:59.330
That'd be good for B
roll or something, right?

59:59.330 --> 1:00:00.163
- Oh.

1:00:00.163 --> 1:00:03.190
Um, sure. Well, uh...

1:00:03.190 --> 1:00:07.010
I would but my guitar is um...

1:00:07.010 --> 1:00:08.090
Well it got, you know,

1:00:08.090 --> 1:00:09.470
it got very cold last night

1:00:09.470 --> 1:00:12.430
and I needed fuel for the fire.

1:00:12.430 --> 1:00:14.300
So, my guitar--
- Oh. Oh.

1:00:14.300 --> 1:00:17.052
- I had to use it for--
- Yeah.

1:00:17.052 --> 1:00:18.560
- I'm gonna get another one.

1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:20.580
- Yeah, yeah, I mean.
- Maybe even a few.

1:00:20.580 --> 1:00:21.934
- You know what they say,

1:00:21.934 --> 1:00:24.858
music warms the soul, right?

1:00:24.858 --> 1:00:26.747
- (chuckles) Yeah, it, yeah.

1:00:26.747 --> 1:00:28.060
- But yeah, enough about that.

1:00:28.060 --> 1:00:29.870
Let's just get into the questions.

1:00:29.870 --> 1:00:31.370
- Okay. Okay.
(soft guitar music)

1:00:31.370 --> 1:00:34.500
- You didn't graduate, correct?

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:36.220
- Well, no.

1:00:36.220 --> 1:00:37.103
No, I didn't.

1:00:38.210 --> 1:00:39.290
Well, at the time

1:00:42.230 --> 1:00:43.830
I said it was because of stress

1:00:43.830 --> 1:00:46.000
because I um--

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:47.850
- But what was the real reason, Herb?

1:00:48.950 --> 1:00:53.413
- The real reason was
that I saw something.

1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:57.860
Something that I couldn't unsee.

1:00:57.860 --> 1:01:00.053
- Now was this something,

1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:03.283
was it Professor Zardonicus?

1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:06.623
- I guess.

1:01:08.770 --> 1:01:10.033
Look, whatever it was,

1:01:10.940 --> 1:01:12.390
there's nothing else like it.

1:01:13.270 --> 1:01:18.100
- And you saw this creature
on campus, correct?

1:01:18.100 --> 1:01:19.360
- Yes.

1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:20.193
Yes, I did.

1:01:21.330 --> 1:01:22.858
It was uh...

1:01:22.858 --> 1:01:26.640
It was in the spring semester of '89.

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:27.756
Yes, I remember.

1:01:27.756 --> 1:01:30.670
I just finished my midterms.

1:01:30.670 --> 1:01:33.280
- But you didn't tell
anyone about the incident?

1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:34.113
- Well, no.

1:01:34.113 --> 1:01:35.550
I didn't tell the newspapers

1:01:35.550 --> 1:01:38.950
because I didn't want
to be a laughing stock.

1:01:38.950 --> 1:01:41.250
And I didn't tell the campus officials

1:01:41.250 --> 1:01:43.260
because, well, I was in a place

1:01:43.260 --> 1:01:44.840
that I wasn't supposed to be.

1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:46.010
- Oh, really?

1:01:46.010 --> 1:01:47.710
Where was this place?

1:01:47.710 --> 1:01:49.763
- The old abandoned science building.

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.390
Yeah.

1:01:52.390 --> 1:01:57.390
It had been shut down and
abandoned for decades.

1:01:57.460 --> 1:01:59.313
But one night we were out there.

1:02:02.037 --> 1:02:03.940
Well, it was all a part of this initiation

1:02:03.940 --> 1:02:06.450
in this fraternity I
was trying to get into.

1:02:06.450 --> 1:02:10.270
They wanted the pledges to spend the night

1:02:10.270 --> 1:02:12.730
in the old abandoned science building.

1:02:12.730 --> 1:02:13.563
And, you know,

1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:16.610
there were rumors that it was haunted

1:02:16.610 --> 1:02:19.650
and people had gone and disappeared and...

1:02:19.650 --> 1:02:22.833
So I was, you know,
thought I was big shit.

1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:27.340
I stumbled in and started
going down the halls

1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:31.873
and then there was just nothing.

1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:36.310
Just all of a sudden there was nothing.

1:02:36.310 --> 1:02:37.420
And um...

1:02:38.810 --> 1:02:41.633
But then I heard the noise.

1:02:44.340 --> 1:02:48.110
You know, I was drunk
off my ass that night

1:02:49.230 --> 1:02:52.423
but I have never ever
heard a sound like that.

1:02:55.580 --> 1:02:58.810
Then I turned around and

1:03:01.350 --> 1:03:05.680
it was on me, this creature.

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:08.590
And it was coming at me

1:03:08.590 --> 1:03:12.030
and it was, he was swinging his claws,

1:03:12.030 --> 1:03:13.585
these giant claws.

1:03:13.585 --> 1:03:15.752
(sobbing)

1:03:16.857 --> 1:03:18.207
- What else happened, Herb?

1:03:19.878 --> 1:03:21.033
- What happened?

1:03:22.610 --> 1:03:24.480
What happened was I ran.

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:26.227
I ran and I ran and I ran

1:03:26.227 --> 1:03:27.901
and I ran for my life

1:03:27.901 --> 1:03:32.630
and I just ran until I was
out of the goddamn building

1:03:32.630 --> 1:03:35.113
and I just kept running and running.

1:03:36.270 --> 1:03:38.727
Anyways, the next thing I
know I'm (clears throat),

1:03:41.531 --> 1:03:43.060
well I'm back at my place

1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:45.250
and my friends are all around me

1:03:46.314 --> 1:03:48.023
and they're, you know,

1:03:49.409 --> 1:03:50.840
telling me something happened

1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:52.020
or wondering what happened

1:03:52.020 --> 1:03:54.070
and I don't know what happened and it's--

1:03:55.380 --> 1:03:57.260
- Why didn't you tell anyone, Herb?

1:03:57.260 --> 1:04:00.750
- Well, I wish I had told someone.

1:04:00.750 --> 1:04:03.183
I mean, I wish I had the
guts to tell somebody.

1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:10.030
Listen, you can't do the same, all right.

1:04:10.030 --> 1:04:11.700
If that creature is still out there,

1:04:11.700 --> 1:04:13.440
you can't do the same.

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:15.970
Do you understand me, son?

1:04:15.970 --> 1:04:18.343
- I understand you completely, Herb.

1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:23.870
Now, not that I'm keeping
track or anything, Greg,

1:04:23.870 --> 1:04:27.320
but I think that's
Darren one, society zero.

1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:28.153
- [Greg] You know, Darren,

1:04:28.153 --> 1:04:29.880
you could've told me what
we were doing out here.

1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:33.260
- I don't know, it didn't
seem relevant at the time.

1:04:33.260 --> 1:04:35.020
- [Greg] It didn't seem relevant?

1:04:35.020 --> 1:04:37.690
Darren, this guy could've been dangerous.

1:04:37.690 --> 1:04:39.850
- Yeah, dangerously woke.

1:04:39.850 --> 1:04:43.010
- [Greg] Darren, that's
such fucking horse shit.

1:04:43.010 --> 1:04:44.000
- What do you mean?

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.360
- [Greg] What do you think
we even did out here?

1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:46.340
What do you think we proved?

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:48.060
- We just found the tide turner.

1:04:48.060 --> 1:04:51.220
We have another witness
of Professor Zardonicus.

1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:52.053
I'm not alone.

1:04:52.053 --> 1:04:53.330
It proves that I wasn't lying.

1:04:53.330 --> 1:04:55.252
- [Greg] But that can't be--

1:04:55.252 --> 1:04:58.080
- Say, you boys want a drink for the road?

1:04:58.080 --> 1:04:59.230
- Oh, no thanks.

1:04:59.230 --> 1:05:01.040
We're just about to head out.

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:01.910
You ready, Greg?

1:05:01.910 --> 1:05:03.933
Thank you again, Mr. Kint.

1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:05.873
- Sure.

1:05:07.380 --> 1:05:08.213
No problem.

1:05:09.460 --> 1:05:10.370
- We got a long walk back.

1:05:10.370 --> 1:05:11.700
- [Greg] Let's just go, Darren.

1:05:11.700 --> 1:05:12.533
- All right.
- Fuck.

1:05:12.533 --> 1:05:13.960
- [Darren] I love your place.

1:05:18.300 --> 1:05:21.210
- After today's journey into the woods

1:05:21.210 --> 1:05:23.663
to meet Herbert Kint,

1:05:25.479 --> 1:05:27.723
some developments were made.

1:05:30.230 --> 1:05:35.040
We learned that Darren
might actually be...

1:05:38.028 --> 1:05:39.460
What am I saying?

1:05:39.460 --> 1:05:41.500
We learned that there

1:05:43.774 --> 1:05:46.480
might be more credence...

1:05:53.010 --> 1:05:56.100
So I was thinking about what
Rachel said the other day

1:05:56.100 --> 1:05:56.933
and she's right.

1:05:56.933 --> 1:05:58.600
I don't know anything about Darren.

1:05:58.600 --> 1:05:59.850
I don't know his history.

1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:02.670
Like nothing.

1:06:02.670 --> 1:06:06.733
And with his behavior
becoming even more erratic,

1:06:07.670 --> 1:06:09.220
I thought it would help
to do some research

1:06:09.220 --> 1:06:13.200
and I found out some
pretty interesting things.

1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:17.070
So Darren Mitchell was
born to Ryan Mitchell.

1:06:17.070 --> 1:06:19.170
Ryan Mitchell is an oil and gas guy.

1:06:19.170 --> 1:06:20.003
He's been around forever.

1:06:20.003 --> 1:06:23.840
He's worked with ExxonMobil,
Shell, and Enron.

1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:26.880
Now, there's an unfortunate thing here.

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:30.000
Darren was not born to
Ryan Mitchell's wife.

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.260
Darren was born to Ryan
Mitchell's secretary.

1:06:33.260 --> 1:06:34.850
So we can probably see where

1:06:34.850 --> 1:06:38.600
some developmental issues start occurring.

1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:40.820
So Darren seemingly
had a normal childhood.

1:06:40.820 --> 1:06:42.140
He was just going to different

1:06:42.140 --> 1:06:44.210
private schools around the country

1:06:44.210 --> 1:06:48.750
until one gap where he just
stopped going to school

1:06:48.750 --> 1:06:49.730
for about two years

1:06:49.730 --> 1:06:52.000
when he was maybe 11 or 12.

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:55.460
There's no real way to find out why.

1:06:55.460 --> 1:06:57.440
All of this is confidential, of course.

1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:00.330
So, there's only one person I can talk to.

1:07:00.330 --> 1:07:01.900
And if I'm right,

1:07:01.900 --> 1:07:05.703
that person will be getting
out of work right now.

1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:10.463
Hi, Mr. Mitchell?

1:07:11.340 --> 1:07:12.173
Hi, Mr. Mitchell. I need to talk to you.

1:07:12.173 --> 1:07:13.460
- What the hell is this?

1:07:13.460 --> 1:07:15.160
- [Greg] No, I need to talk to you, sir.

1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:16.590
- You can't just accost me like this.

1:07:16.590 --> 1:07:17.780
- [Greg] I'm not accosting you, sir.

1:07:17.780 --> 1:07:19.140
Sir, this is important.

1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:20.253
This is about Darren.

1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:23.370
This is about your son, Mr. Mitchell.

1:07:26.410 --> 1:07:27.243
- Who are you?

1:07:27.243 --> 1:07:30.420
- [Greg] I'm a friend of Darren's and I--

1:07:30.420 --> 1:07:31.253
- Friend?

1:07:31.253 --> 1:07:32.480
- [Greg] Yes.

1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:34.440
And, look, just give me a couple minutes,

1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:37.420
I'll explain, but I do
need to talk to you.

1:07:37.420 --> 1:07:40.640
- You're making a documentary about this?

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:41.580
- [Greg] Yeah.

1:07:41.580 --> 1:07:43.030
It's for a school assignment.

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:45.163
- About what again?

1:07:47.170 --> 1:07:48.833
- [Greg] Professor Zardonicus.

1:07:50.380 --> 1:07:52.259
- Ah.
- Yeah, I know.

1:07:52.259 --> 1:07:53.343
- That's a new one.

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:55.660
- [Greg] I'm sorry. New one?

1:07:55.660 --> 1:07:57.290
What do you mean by that?

1:07:57.290 --> 1:07:58.513
- When my son was a boy,

1:07:59.450 --> 1:08:02.780
he had an overactive imagination.

1:08:02.780 --> 1:08:04.920
Most children are
steadfast in their beliefs

1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:09.920
but Darren was unusually convicted.

1:08:13.540 --> 1:08:16.130
Unfortunately, I indulged his beliefs,

1:08:16.130 --> 1:08:17.483
even the ridiculous ones.

1:08:18.321 --> 1:08:20.571
It was the only thing
that would satisfy him.

1:08:22.330 --> 1:08:23.750
Then I hear from his teachers

1:08:23.750 --> 1:08:27.590
that he has started taking
his stories to school,

1:08:27.590 --> 1:08:30.760
scaring his fellow classmates.

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:35.210
One year he told us that Santa Claus

1:08:35.210 --> 1:08:36.783
had tried to kidnap him.

1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:39.803
That was a rough Christmas.

1:08:40.990 --> 1:08:43.500
Then I hear that he has started

1:08:43.500 --> 1:08:46.640
luring other children out into the woods.

1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:49.070
I didn't think he would do anything but

1:08:51.610 --> 1:08:54.480
it was time to get him some help.

1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:55.613
So I,

1:08:57.910 --> 1:09:00.900
I sent him to a child psychiatrist

1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:03.030
recommended by my colleagues and...

1:09:06.370 --> 1:09:08.020
- [Greg] And what? What happened?

1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:14.770
- They couldn't find
anything wrong with him.

1:09:14.770 --> 1:09:16.870
Couldn't diagnose him with a single thing.

1:09:21.140 --> 1:09:23.600
I don't know what Darren thinks he saw

1:09:24.980 --> 1:09:26.433
but he wasn't lying.

1:09:27.610 --> 1:09:28.600
Anyway, I...

1:09:30.180 --> 1:09:31.272
I gotta get going.

1:09:31.272 --> 1:09:33.020
I gotta beat the traffic.

1:09:33.020 --> 1:09:35.300
- [Greg] Oh, sure. I understand.

1:09:35.300 --> 1:09:37.430
Look, if you could just not tell Darren

1:09:37.430 --> 1:09:38.580
that we had this conversation,

1:09:38.580 --> 1:09:39.693
I'd appreciate it.

1:09:41.850 --> 1:09:43.700
- You don't have to worry about that.

1:09:46.170 --> 1:09:48.083
My son doesn't speak to me anymore.

1:09:54.030 --> 1:09:55.130
- So that did nothing.

1:09:56.390 --> 1:10:00.290
I learned that Darren has
been to an institution,

1:10:00.290 --> 1:10:02.433
though they couldn't
diagnose him with anything.

1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:04.530
So that doesn't really comfort me

1:10:04.530 --> 1:10:06.140
when he has a long history

1:10:06.140 --> 1:10:08.930
of luring people out into the woods.

1:10:08.930 --> 1:10:11.530
And I don't know how I'm
gonna talk to Darren about it.

1:10:11.530 --> 1:10:13.350
What, am I gonna tell him that I thought

1:10:13.350 --> 1:10:16.170
I ran into his estranged
father at the grocery store

1:10:16.170 --> 1:10:17.710
and we just got to talking

1:10:17.710 --> 1:10:20.530
about his history with delusions?

1:10:20.530 --> 1:10:23.383
I mean, no matter what,
this is a lose lose for me.

1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:25.233
Either Darren's fine

1:10:25.233 --> 1:10:28.870
and I've been just sneaking into his past

1:10:28.870 --> 1:10:30.860
or he's actually unstable

1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:32.780
and I've been exploiting
a mentally ill person

1:10:32.780 --> 1:10:36.923
for a fucking class assignment.

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.500
There is a distinct possibility

1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:43.690
that I don't know what I'm doing

1:10:44.830 --> 1:10:49.830
and that I've really hurt this guy.

1:10:50.630 --> 1:10:52.420
'Cause this, this right here,

1:10:52.420 --> 1:10:54.343
cannot be healthy for him.

1:10:54.343 --> 1:10:56.080
I've just created an atmosphere

1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:57.040
where I make him think

1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:58.543
that this behavior is okay.

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:04.503
I've indulged him and for what?

1:11:05.430 --> 1:11:07.260
I don't know if I should
tell him that he needs help,

1:11:07.260 --> 1:11:09.940
but I can't keep indulging this, right?

1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:11.850
I can't keep pretending that thing...

1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:14.513
What the fuck?

1:11:16.450 --> 1:11:17.283
Shit.

1:11:22.670 --> 1:11:23.503
Darren?

1:11:23.503 --> 1:11:25.030
- Hello, Gregory.

1:11:25.030 --> 1:11:27.052
- [Greg] What are you doing here?

1:11:27.052 --> 1:11:29.902
- I have some very important
information to relay to you.

1:11:30.940 --> 1:11:32.350
- [Greg] Okay.

1:11:32.350 --> 1:11:33.860
This couldn't have been over the phone?

1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:35.240
- I'm sure it could've been over the phone

1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:37.050
if you want the NSA to eavesdrop on us

1:11:37.050 --> 1:11:39.700
and have us murdered and
covered up as a suicide, yeah.

1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:41.480
But I don't think that's
what either of us wants.

1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:43.390
So the more important question is

1:11:43.390 --> 1:11:46.003
thank you for saving my life, Darren.

1:11:46.003 --> 1:11:47.250
- [Greg] That's not even a question.

1:11:47.250 --> 1:11:48.780
- Keep the camera up here.

1:11:48.780 --> 1:11:49.930
- [Greg] Can we keep this short?

1:11:49.930 --> 1:11:54.090
- I mean, as short as
uncovering and verbally sharing

1:11:54.090 --> 1:11:55.460
a piece of crucial information

1:11:55.460 --> 1:11:56.570
to our investigation can be.

1:11:56.570 --> 1:11:57.790
Sure, I'll keep it short.

1:11:57.790 --> 1:12:02.160
- [Greg] Okay, and this is
not technically my apartment.

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:04.490
So if you could just
be careful around shit.

1:12:04.490 --> 1:12:06.780
- You have a key, right?

1:12:06.780 --> 1:12:09.493
- What?
- You have a key?

1:12:09.493 --> 1:12:10.326
You have a key

1:12:10.326 --> 1:12:11.159
to the apartment?
- My girlfriend gave me a key

1:12:11.159 --> 1:12:12.330
but this--
- Perfect. Then let me in.

1:12:12.330 --> 1:12:13.500
I've been waiting.

1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:14.333
Is she not here?

1:12:14.333 --> 1:12:15.280
- Fuck.
- Keep the camera up here.

1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:16.630
- Okay, goddammit.

1:12:16.630 --> 1:12:17.630
Darren, what are you doing here?

1:12:17.630 --> 1:12:19.860
- How much does this thing cost exactly?

1:12:19.860 --> 1:12:21.260
- [Greg] The coffee maker? I don't know.

1:12:21.260 --> 1:12:23.240
- Yeah, I mean, the only reason I asked

1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:24.820
is because I have one just like it

1:12:24.820 --> 1:12:26.440
and I think it's starting
to break down on me

1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:28.600
'cause this morning I made
myself a cup of coffee

1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:30.350
and it was just, it was mostly grain.

1:12:30.350 --> 1:12:32.400
There was hardly any liquid in it at all.

1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:33.640
And it's hard to start the morning

1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:34.687
with a mouthful of grain,
you know what I mean?

1:12:34.687 --> 1:12:37.840
- [Greg] Did you come to
talk about coffee grains?

1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:39.420
Why are you here, Darren?

1:12:39.420 --> 1:12:40.810
Just tell me why you're here.

1:12:40.810 --> 1:12:43.200
- No reason, nothing big except...

1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:44.310
Oh, oh yeah, I remember now.

1:12:44.310 --> 1:12:46.560
I know where to find Professor Zardonicus.

1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:49.190
- [Greg] What?

1:12:49.190 --> 1:12:50.570
- Don't tell me you already forgot

1:12:50.570 --> 1:12:51.803
who Professor Zardonicus is, Greg.

1:12:51.803 --> 1:12:53.140
- [Greg] I didn't forget who he was.

1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:54.548
I just...

1:12:54.548 --> 1:12:55.381
Okay.

1:12:56.290 --> 1:12:58.050
How? Was, where?

1:12:58.050 --> 1:12:59.590
- I don't know how I can explain it

1:12:59.590 --> 1:13:00.850
any simpler than that, Greg.

1:13:00.850 --> 1:13:02.670
I know where he is, where he lives,

1:13:02.670 --> 1:13:04.630
the place he rests his head at night,

1:13:04.630 --> 1:13:06.440
where he keeps all of
his magazines, you know.

1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:07.690
The place--
- Hey, Greg?

1:13:08.885 --> 1:13:10.821
Are we still going to the movie?

1:13:10.821 --> 1:13:11.654
It's about to start.
- How long have you

1:13:11.654 --> 1:13:13.993
been standing there?

1:13:13.993 --> 1:13:15.080
- A second.

1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:17.320
- Greg, did you see her walk in?

1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:18.740
- [Greg] Yeah, I mean, she lives here

1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:19.850
so I didn't think it was a big deal.

1:13:19.850 --> 1:13:22.040
- This is a private conversation, Greg.

1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:24.020
Two ears only. No third parties.

1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:25.483
- I can just go.

1:13:27.330 --> 1:13:28.190
- No.

1:13:28.190 --> 1:13:29.720
No, she already fucking ruined it.

1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:31.727
The whole ambience is just...

1:13:32.888 --> 1:13:34.110
- Greg, what's going on?
- I don't know.

1:13:34.110 --> 1:13:35.195
I don't...

1:13:35.195 --> 1:13:36.833
We're just having like
a production meeting.

1:13:36.833 --> 1:13:38.330
- I would be much more comfortable

1:13:38.330 --> 1:13:39.380
if we talked in here.

1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:41.480
- [Greg] The closet?

1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:42.420
- Yeah.
- The fucking closet?

1:13:42.420 --> 1:13:43.253
- The closet.

1:13:43.253 --> 1:13:44.210
I would be much more comfortable

1:13:44.210 --> 1:13:45.500
if we had this conversation in here

1:13:45.500 --> 1:13:47.300
and I assume my comfort matters to you.

1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:48.870
- Like I said, I can just go.

1:13:48.870 --> 1:13:50.860
- Oh, I'm so glad you can do something.

1:13:50.860 --> 1:13:52.370
I didn't hear you the first time.

1:13:52.370 --> 1:13:56.450
Greg, will you say something?
- Hey!

1:13:56.450 --> 1:13:58.540
I'm not going in the closet.

1:13:58.540 --> 1:14:00.540
I'm not.
- If you're not

1:14:00.540 --> 1:14:01.423
going in the closet,

1:14:01.423 --> 1:14:03.290
then I'm gonna stop speaking entirely.

1:14:03.290 --> 1:14:04.890
- Greg, don't go into the closet.

1:14:04.890 --> 1:14:06.033
- [Greg] I'm not going in the closet.

1:14:06.033 --> 1:14:08.030
- Then I'm gonna stop
speaking starting now.

1:14:08.030 --> 1:14:10.258
- Oh, so if I said that
Professor Zardonicus

1:14:10.258 --> 1:14:11.580
is a little horseshit--

1:14:11.580 --> 1:14:12.413
- I would!

1:14:12.413 --> 1:14:14.770
I would say you're full of shit.

1:14:14.770 --> 1:14:17.470
But I'm not speaking, so there's that.

1:14:17.470 --> 1:14:19.220
- [Greg] We can go anywhere else, okay?

1:14:19.220 --> 1:14:20.550
We can go to a cafe.

1:14:20.550 --> 1:14:21.580
We can go to a library.

1:14:21.580 --> 1:14:23.540
Just not the fucking closet.

1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:26.110
- If I was speaking I would
say that's a great idea.

1:14:26.110 --> 1:14:26.943
But I'm not speaking, so there's that.

1:14:26.943 --> 1:14:28.940
- Greg, you're not actually
humoring this, are you?

1:14:28.940 --> 1:14:32.320
- There's nothing humorous about this.

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:34.823
Now, Greg, go in the closet with me.

1:14:35.980 --> 1:14:36.830
- [Greg] I can't go in the closet.

1:14:36.830 --> 1:14:37.668
- Please, Greg.

1:14:37.668 --> 1:14:38.868
You and me in the closet together now.

1:14:38.868 --> 1:14:40.050
- Fucking stop it!

1:14:40.050 --> 1:14:41.718
- You'd better not follow
us in there either!

1:14:41.718 --> 1:14:42.960
- I don't plan on following

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:44.032
you into the closet.
- I see it in your eyes.

1:14:44.032 --> 1:14:44.865
- What's even going on here?
You're gonna follow

1:14:44.865 --> 1:14:45.710
us in there.

1:14:45.710 --> 1:14:46.840
Are you gonna stand out here with a cup

1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:47.741
to the door and listen?
- I am not going into

1:14:47.741 --> 1:14:48.574
the closet with you.

1:14:48.574 --> 1:14:49.407
What are you doing?
- Is that what you want?

1:14:49.407 --> 1:14:51.269
(all shouting)

1:14:51.269 --> 1:14:52.240
This whole fucking time!

1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:53.790
- [Greg] Jesus fucking Christ, Darren.

1:14:53.790 --> 1:14:57.030
I mean you have been an idiot for most--

1:14:57.030 --> 1:14:58.750
- The science building.

1:14:58.750 --> 1:14:59.583
- [Greg] What?

1:14:59.583 --> 1:15:00.416
- The old science building.

1:15:00.416 --> 1:15:01.249
That's where we find him.

1:15:01.249 --> 1:15:02.460
There's where Herb ran into him.

1:15:02.460 --> 1:15:03.540
That's where he was created,

1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:05.580
where Professor Zardonicus was born.

1:15:05.580 --> 1:15:07.750
It's been right in front of
our face this entire time.

1:15:07.750 --> 1:15:08.920
We're going down there tonight

1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:10.833
and we're proving to the
world once and for all

1:15:10.833 --> 1:15:13.158
that Professor Zardonicus is real.

1:15:13.158 --> 1:15:13.991
(soft guitar music)

1:15:13.991 --> 1:15:15.290
- [Greg] Okay, you are asking me

1:15:15.290 --> 1:15:18.723
to do something very very stupid, Darren.

1:15:19.900 --> 1:15:21.300
If we go there, if we're caught--

1:15:21.300 --> 1:15:24.090
- If he's not there, I'll quit.

1:15:24.090 --> 1:15:25.350
There's nowhere else to look, Greg.

1:15:25.350 --> 1:15:26.360
This is it.

1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:27.970
Our last chance.

1:15:27.970 --> 1:15:29.320
- [Greg] Do you actually mean that?

1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:31.350
- [Darren] I wouldn't say
it if I didn't mean it.

1:15:31.350 --> 1:15:33.190
- [Greg] If he's not
down there, we're done.

1:15:33.190 --> 1:15:34.360
Completely done.

1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:35.193
- That's what I'm saying.

1:15:35.193 --> 1:15:36.260
- [Greg] I have your word on that?

1:15:36.260 --> 1:15:37.093
- Yes.

1:15:39.290 --> 1:15:40.123
- [Greg] Okay.

1:15:45.470 --> 1:15:47.730
Hey, look, I got something I gotta do.

1:15:47.730 --> 1:15:48.830
Just give me a minute.

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:50.760
Uh, hey.

1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:53.440
So, I know that was weird
and that I've been weird

1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:57.570
but I can promise you that
tonight is the last night.

1:15:57.570 --> 1:15:58.620
- [Rachel] Where are you going?

1:15:58.620 --> 1:15:59.670
- [Greg] It doesn't matter.

1:15:59.670 --> 1:16:01.220
He said he's gonna quit.

1:16:01.220 --> 1:16:02.640
That means we can put
everything behind us.

1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:04.170
It means you never have to hear

1:16:04.170 --> 1:16:06.233
the name Professor Zardonicus ever again.

1:16:07.196 --> 1:16:08.840
- [Rachel] Okay.

1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:09.673
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:12.483
- [Greg] Thank you.

1:16:13.330 --> 1:16:14.413
I will be back.

1:16:15.890 --> 1:16:17.550
Soon, I hope.

1:16:17.550 --> 1:16:19.360
Okay, love you. Bye.

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:22.990
- Today is November 5th, 2019.

1:16:22.990 --> 1:16:24.590
I, Darren James Mitchell,

1:16:24.590 --> 1:16:26.990
am standing in front of
the old science building

1:16:26.990 --> 1:16:29.150
which also serves as the resting place

1:16:29.150 --> 1:16:30.573
for Professor Zardonicus.

1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:34.050
As we reach the end of my journey,

1:16:34.050 --> 1:16:35.370
I look back on all the times

1:16:35.370 --> 1:16:38.703
my partner and I were met
with mockery and scorn.

1:16:40.290 --> 1:16:41.680
I think back on my life

1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:44.390
and how at times it seemed like

1:16:44.390 --> 1:16:45.883
nothing more than a sad joke.

1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:51.120
In many ways I have much more
in common with the Professor

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:53.710
than I do with, say, regular people.

1:16:53.710 --> 1:16:58.620
He was the subject of a
horrific and cruel prank

1:16:58.620 --> 1:17:00.470
which transformed him into something,

1:17:01.390 --> 1:17:03.663
something less than he was before.

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:08.693
I do not wish to harm the
Professor or judge him in any way.

1:17:09.830 --> 1:17:11.280
My allegiance is to the truth

1:17:12.288 --> 1:17:13.588
and the truth I shall have

1:17:14.525 --> 1:17:15.833
at all costs.

1:17:17.208 --> 1:17:18.430
(loud clattering)

1:17:18.430 --> 1:17:19.592
- What?
- Did you hear that?

1:17:19.592 --> 1:17:20.920
- [Greg] What?

1:17:20.920 --> 1:17:22.572
- Come on.
- What?

1:17:22.572 --> 1:17:23.553
The fuck are we going?

1:17:23.553 --> 1:17:24.845
Where are we...

1:17:24.845 --> 1:17:26.020
Darren!

1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:26.853
Darren, slow down, slow down.
- Shit.

1:17:26.853 --> 1:17:29.520
Holy fuck. Where are we?
- He's in here somewhere.

1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.113
- [Greg] Okay, let's just
make this quick, all right?

1:17:32.113 --> 1:17:32.946
- There it is.

1:17:32.946 --> 1:17:34.723
I thought I forgot it.
- What the fuck?

1:17:34.723 --> 1:17:35.733
- [Darren] What?

1:17:35.733 --> 1:17:37.870
- [Greg] Is that a gun? A real gun?

1:17:37.870 --> 1:17:39.530
- No, Greg, I brought a fake gun

1:17:39.530 --> 1:17:41.270
to fight a very real monster.

1:17:41.270 --> 1:17:42.870
What do you think?

1:17:42.870 --> 1:17:44.270
- [Greg] I think you're gonna go to jail

1:17:44.270 --> 1:17:45.103
when somebody finds you with that.

1:17:45.103 --> 1:17:47.580
- Oh, I'm sorry I wanted to
be at least a little prepared

1:17:47.580 --> 1:17:49.410
if we're hunting down a monster.

1:17:49.410 --> 1:17:51.320
- [Greg] You can't keep doing
this shit to me, Darren.

1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:52.153
- Doing what?

1:17:53.313 --> 1:17:55.930
- [Greg] All the fucking mystery stuff

1:17:55.930 --> 1:17:57.600
where you put me through a heart attack.

1:17:57.600 --> 1:17:58.820
I thought we were partners!

1:17:58.820 --> 1:18:00.770
- We are partners, Greg.

1:18:00.770 --> 1:18:02.373
- [Greg] Then why don't you
console me about anything?

1:18:02.373 --> 1:18:04.760
- Because I don't wanna
make things more complicated

1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:05.593
than they have to be.

1:18:05.593 --> 1:18:07.050
- [Greg] Oh, like they're
not complicated right now?

1:18:07.050 --> 1:18:08.580
Doesn't this feel complicated?

1:18:08.580 --> 1:18:10.300
- Because I don't wanna
get into a little fight

1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:12.030
over every single thing, all right?

1:18:12.030 --> 1:18:13.080
This is not a big deal.

1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:14.830
Everything's worked out so far.

1:18:14.830 --> 1:18:16.407
- [Greg] Says the man
with lipstick on his face.

1:18:16.407 --> 1:18:18.404
- That's not the point.

1:18:18.404 --> 1:18:19.735
- [Greg] Okay, Darren, stop.

1:18:19.735 --> 1:18:21.083
We need to talk.

1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:23.493
Darren, I said stop.

1:18:24.790 --> 1:18:25.623
Fuck.

1:18:25.623 --> 1:18:27.463
Darren, stop or I turn off the camera!

1:18:29.190 --> 1:18:30.420
- What?

1:18:30.420 --> 1:18:31.600
- [Greg] Yeah.

1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:33.050
Well, that did it, didn't it?

1:18:34.350 --> 1:18:35.183
That's all this is,

1:18:35.183 --> 1:18:37.540
is just showing off
for the fucking camera.

1:18:37.540 --> 1:18:39.270
- What are you saying, Greg?

1:18:39.270 --> 1:18:43.220
- [Greg] I'm saying that the only reason

1:18:43.220 --> 1:18:45.530
you pretend to need me,

1:18:45.530 --> 1:18:47.620
like when you obviously have enough money

1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:48.930
to buy your own equipment,

1:18:48.930 --> 1:18:50.370
to buy whatever you need,

1:18:50.370 --> 1:18:54.660
it's just to satisfy your own ego.

1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:55.783
- I never said that.

1:18:56.830 --> 1:18:58.180
- [Greg] You don't have to.

1:18:59.410 --> 1:19:01.520
You need the one thing
that money can't buy you

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:03.000
and that's the validation.

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:04.390
- You're making stuff up now.

1:19:04.390 --> 1:19:06.300
- [Greg] Am I? Am I really?

1:19:06.300 --> 1:19:09.107
Dude, okay, that is the
only reason we're down here.

1:19:09.107 --> 1:19:10.140
That's the only reason

1:19:10.140 --> 1:19:12.550
I'm walking around a
fucking basement with you

1:19:12.550 --> 1:19:15.203
looking for something
that doesn't even exist!

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:18.080
- Wait, you don't...

1:19:19.178 --> 1:19:20.629
You don't believe in Professor Zardonicus?

1:19:20.629 --> 1:19:22.223
- [Greg] Of course I don't!

1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:24.650
Jesus Christ.

1:19:24.650 --> 1:19:26.300
- [Darren] So you've been
lying to me this whole time.

1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:28.100
- [Greg] Okay, don't
turn this on me, dude.

1:19:28.100 --> 1:19:30.390
- No, what about that night
at the fountain, Greg?

1:19:30.390 --> 1:19:31.223
- What?
- Did you see

1:19:31.223 --> 1:19:32.140
Professor Zardonicus then

1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:35.227
or were you just lying for
some sort of sick joke?

1:19:35.227 --> 1:19:36.610
- Do not--
- Is that all this whole

1:19:36.610 --> 1:19:37.888
experience has been?
- Do not pretend

1:19:37.888 --> 1:19:40.280
that you don't have some serous issues.

1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:42.840
- Oh, I'm sorry that
I'm able to comprehend

1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:45.280
something beyond your
limited scope of imagination.

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.070
- [Greg] And I'm sorry that
you're fucking delusional

1:19:47.070 --> 1:19:48.570
just like when you were a kid.

1:19:50.057 --> 1:19:50.950
(Greg sighs)

1:19:50.950 --> 1:19:52.030
Okay, I'm sorry.

1:19:52.030 --> 1:19:52.910
- What'd you just say?

1:19:52.910 --> 1:19:53.743
- [Greg] I shouldn't have said that.

1:19:53.743 --> 1:19:55.750
I'm sorry.
- When I was a kid?

1:19:55.750 --> 1:19:57.490
- Yes, I, look--
- Have you been snooping

1:19:57.490 --> 1:19:58.590
around my past, Greg?
- No, I've been

1:19:58.590 --> 1:19:59.423
doing research.

1:19:59.423 --> 1:20:00.890
I've been doing research.

1:20:00.890 --> 1:20:02.353
I'm making a documentary.
- You talk about trust.

1:20:02.353 --> 1:20:04.068
- I had to do research.
- You talk about understanding

1:20:04.068 --> 1:20:06.017
having each other's back?
- Hey, hey! Put the gun down!

1:20:06.017 --> 1:20:06.850
Put the fucking gun down.
- Then you pull

1:20:06.850 --> 1:20:08.082
this shit, Greg.

1:20:08.082 --> 1:20:09.520
- [Greg] Put the gun down, Darren.

1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:10.353
- I'm not gonna put the gun down

1:20:10.353 --> 1:20:12.060
because you're a fucking liar

1:20:12.060 --> 1:20:13.430
and you're going behind my back.

1:20:13.430 --> 1:20:14.266
- [Greg] You're not
gonna put the gun down?

1:20:14.266 --> 1:20:15.734
- You're supposed to be my partner, Greg!

1:20:15.734 --> 1:20:17.600
- Okay, fuck you.
- What?

1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:18.710
- I'm out.
- No.

1:20:18.710 --> 1:20:19.906
- I'm really out, man.
- You're not being...

1:20:19.906 --> 1:20:20.750
- [Greg] You crossed the fucking line.

1:20:20.750 --> 1:20:21.870
- Stop it! Greg!
- No, no!

1:20:21.870 --> 1:20:26.107
Let go of the fucking
camera, you son of a...

1:20:26.107 --> 1:20:26.953
Ah, fuck.

1:20:27.823 --> 1:20:29.530
Are you okay?
- Get away from me.

1:20:29.530 --> 1:20:30.834
- What?
- Get away from me, Greg.

1:20:30.834 --> 1:20:31.667
- [Greg] What happened? What?

1:20:31.667 --> 1:20:32.850
Did you get hurt?
- Just go away!

1:20:32.850 --> 1:20:35.806
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Please.

1:20:35.806 --> 1:20:36.910
Stop, Greg.

1:20:36.910 --> 1:20:38.610
- [Greg] Where are the scars?

1:20:38.610 --> 1:20:39.983
- Please, Greg, stop.

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:42.627
- [Greg] Where are the scars, Darren?

1:20:42.627 --> 1:20:44.130
(Darren sobbing)

1:20:44.130 --> 1:20:45.173
Show them to me.

1:20:52.760 --> 1:20:53.669
It was all a lie?

1:20:53.669 --> 1:20:55.233
- No.

1:20:55.233 --> 1:20:57.078
- [Greg] You're just a fucking liar.

1:20:57.078 --> 1:20:58.443
- No, it wasn't a lie.
- You're such a fucking liar.

1:20:58.443 --> 1:21:01.730
- Please, Greg, I just
needed someone to believe me.

1:21:01.730 --> 1:21:04.530
- [Greg] All of your
pretentious bullshit about truth

1:21:04.530 --> 1:21:05.363
and you're just a fucking liar!

1:21:05.363 --> 1:21:07.963
- I just needed you to
believe in me, please.

1:21:08.883 --> 1:21:10.732
I didn't know what else to do.

1:21:10.732 --> 1:21:13.687
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to hurt you, Greg.

1:21:13.687 --> 1:21:15.010
Where are you going?
- Truth my fucking ass.

1:21:15.010 --> 1:21:16.690
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving, Darren.

1:21:16.690 --> 1:21:19.180
What does it look like?
- Please don't leave me.

1:21:19.180 --> 1:21:20.240
You can't leave me down here with him.

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.183
He'll kill me.

1:21:22.183 --> 1:21:23.940
Please, Greg.
- Yeah?

1:21:23.940 --> 1:21:26.200
- Please.
- Good luck.

1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:27.750
- Greg.
- Bye, Darren.

1:21:27.750 --> 1:21:28.583
- [Darren] Greg, no.

1:21:28.583 --> 1:21:30.228
No, Greg, please!

1:21:30.228 --> 1:21:32.811
(Greg panting)

1:21:41.020 --> 1:21:45.564
- This is Greg Hartman of comm 43...

1:21:45.564 --> 1:21:47.113
I can't remember the name.

1:21:49.577 --> 1:21:50.950
I have to announce that

1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:54.710
the Zardonicus project, my final project,

1:21:54.710 --> 1:21:58.090
is officially canceled.

1:21:58.090 --> 1:21:59.450
I just can't...

1:22:01.590 --> 1:22:03.280
I just can't...

1:22:04.260 --> 1:22:05.280
I'm sorry, Professor,

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:06.653
and I hope you understand.

1:22:07.868 --> 1:22:10.375
(creature roaring)
(Greg screams)

1:22:10.375 --> 1:22:11.605
What the fuck?

1:22:11.605 --> 1:22:12.438
What the?

1:22:18.850 --> 1:22:20.935
(tense music)

1:22:20.935 --> 1:22:23.024
- Oh God, please.
- Darren?

1:22:23.024 --> 1:22:25.590
- [Darren] Please, go away.

1:22:25.590 --> 1:22:26.998
- [Greg] Darren, that's you, right?

1:22:26.998 --> 1:22:29.070
- Please, Greg, help me.

1:22:29.070 --> 1:22:31.737
Help me, Greg, help me!
- Darren!

1:22:34.798 --> 1:22:35.812
- Greg, are you still there?
- Darren?

1:22:35.812 --> 1:22:37.945
- Help me, Greg, please.

1:22:37.945 --> 1:22:39.412
- Darren!

1:22:39.412 --> 1:22:40.795
Don't kill him!

1:22:40.795 --> 1:22:43.878
(tense guitar music)

1:23:00.689 --> 1:23:02.142
(creature roars)

1:23:02.142 --> 1:23:04.017
Darren! What the.

1:23:04.017 --> 1:23:04.850
Darren?

1:23:06.580 --> 1:23:08.364
What the fuck.

1:23:08.364 --> 1:23:12.550
(creature roars)
(Greg screams)

1:23:12.550 --> 1:23:13.383
Darren?

1:23:15.190 --> 1:23:16.023
Oh.

1:23:16.938 --> 1:23:19.250
Oh.

1:23:19.250 --> 1:23:20.083
Darren.

1:23:21.610 --> 1:23:23.720
You don't have to do this, Darren.

1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:24.670
You really don't.

1:23:24.670 --> 1:23:25.830
I believe you now.

1:23:25.830 --> 1:23:26.813
No, I believe you.

1:23:26.813 --> 1:23:29.170
Darren, I believe you.

1:23:29.170 --> 1:23:31.299
I believe you, Darren.

1:23:31.299 --> 1:23:32.782
You were right.

1:23:32.782 --> 1:23:37.782
(creature roars)
(Greg screaming)

1:23:47.689 --> 1:23:50.689
(soft guitar music)

1:24:02.140 --> 1:24:03.880
- [Police Officer] This is the police.

1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:06.190
Wherever you are, come out with your...

1:24:06.190 --> 1:24:07.073
Shit.

1:24:12.801 --> 1:24:13.968
What the hell?

1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:23.180
- [Investigator] So you have
no idea what happened to him?

1:24:23.180 --> 1:24:24.330
- No.

1:24:24.330 --> 1:24:25.163
I don't think he made it.

1:24:25.163 --> 1:24:27.100
- [Investigator 2] You
don't think he made it?

1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:29.153
So what, do you think he was injured?

1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:34.622
- I think he got exactly what he wanted.

1:24:34.622 --> 1:24:36.900
- [Investigator] And what was that?

1:24:36.900 --> 1:24:39.015
- To meet Professor Zardonicus.

1:24:39.015 --> 1:24:40.310
- [Investigator] Wait, wait,
wait, so now you're saying

1:24:40.310 --> 1:24:42.483
you believe in this Professor Zardonicus?

1:24:44.078 --> 1:24:45.083
- I know what I saw.

1:24:47.228 --> 1:24:48.573
I know what I saw.

1:24:54.446 --> 1:24:56.863
(Greg sighs)

1:25:14.992 --> 1:25:17.010
- Do you need help with that?

1:25:17.010 --> 1:25:17.879
- No, that's okay.

1:25:17.879 --> 1:25:19.580
It hasn't been too long

1:25:19.580 --> 1:25:22.413
since I was on the other
end of this operation.

1:25:23.309 --> 1:25:25.150
- Okay, well, first of all,

1:25:25.150 --> 1:25:28.150
I just wanna say thank you for doing this.

1:25:28.150 --> 1:25:28.983
- Oh yeah, sure.

1:25:28.983 --> 1:25:31.723
- I know it's been a lot for you.

1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:34.700
- It is what it is, right?

1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:36.130
- Mm-hmm.

1:25:36.130 --> 1:25:38.880
So, I just wanna start off,

1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:43.100
just how are you now after everything?

1:25:43.100 --> 1:25:43.933
- Sure.

1:25:46.570 --> 1:25:50.710
Well, since Darren's disappearance,

1:25:50.710 --> 1:25:53.343
things have changed for me a lot.

1:25:55.150 --> 1:25:56.460
So, I'm sure you guys know this,

1:25:56.460 --> 1:25:58.490
but after everything came out

1:25:58.490 --> 1:26:01.230
about what Darren and I were up to,

1:26:01.230 --> 1:26:03.980
a huge scandal came out of it

1:26:03.980 --> 1:26:07.430
and the film department decided

1:26:07.430 --> 1:26:09.403
to put me under academic probation.

1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:11.190
And on top of that,

1:26:12.270 --> 1:26:15.160
the footage that I had
been shooting leaked

1:26:16.244 --> 1:26:17.740
and everybody saw it

1:26:19.090 --> 1:26:20.600
and all these intimate moments

1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:21.903
that Darren and I had.

1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:27.960
Seeing those from a
stranger's eyes, I guess,

1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:32.340
puts a different perspective
on the whole thing

1:26:33.205 --> 1:26:35.873
and I just couldn't be on that campus

1:26:35.873 --> 1:26:38.023
without thinking about him, honestly.

1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:41.396
I decided to cut the cord.

1:26:41.396 --> 1:26:42.229
Fuck.

1:26:42.229 --> 1:26:44.653
I decided to cut the cord
and drop out of school.

1:26:47.230 --> 1:26:51.483
Which sounds like a pretty
dumb idea right now.

1:26:54.470 --> 1:26:56.400
My girlfriend at the time was a very,

1:26:56.400 --> 1:26:58.310
she still is, a very ambitious person

1:26:58.310 --> 1:27:01.380
and I think we both realized

1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:02.980
that I was just dead weight to her

1:27:02.980 --> 1:27:06.783
and that I probably had
been for a very long time.

1:27:07.670 --> 1:27:10.337
And yeah, that was the end of that.

1:27:10.337 --> 1:27:12.763
So I'm kinda on my own these days.

1:27:14.070 --> 1:27:14.903
- Okay.

1:27:16.570 --> 1:27:17.573
I'm sorry.

1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:23.460
I kinda wanna focus more on Darren now,

1:27:23.460 --> 1:27:24.463
if you don't mind.

1:27:24.463 --> 1:27:25.563
I just wanna know,

1:27:27.450 --> 1:27:30.260
'cause I know you've been looking for him.

1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:32.420
- Well, I mean, looking for him,

1:27:32.420 --> 1:27:33.830
I don't expect to find him.

1:27:33.830 --> 1:27:37.040
What I've done is I've
created a movement of sorts

1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:40.227
to try to reach out to him, you know.

1:27:40.227 --> 1:27:42.713
I want him to come back to me.

1:27:43.580 --> 1:27:45.250
I want it to be a mutual thing

1:27:46.658 --> 1:27:49.200
'cause I don't blame him for feeling

1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:51.140
that I took advantage of him

1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:52.960
and that I exploited him.

1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:56.480
So I want him to know
that I do care about him

1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:58.620
and that I am sorry

1:27:58.620 --> 1:28:02.580
and I've just been putting up
these flyers and everything

1:28:02.580 --> 1:28:06.490
hoping to hear back from him.

1:28:06.490 --> 1:28:08.980
Obviously, nothing's come from that but

1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:11.870
it does feel good knowing

1:28:11.870 --> 1:28:14.170
that I am doing what I'm
supposed to be doing.

1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:17.520
That's not something I've ever

1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:20.640
really been able to say
before but I can say it now

1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:24.050
and that's at least one positive thing

1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:28.100
I can say about this whole mess.

1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:29.510
- Okay.

1:28:29.510 --> 1:28:31.090
Does this involve anything

1:28:31.090 --> 1:28:34.420
with Professor Zardonicus by any means?

1:28:34.420 --> 1:28:39.050
I mean, you did say that
you believe you saw him.

1:28:39.050 --> 1:28:40.003
- Well, okay.

1:28:41.260 --> 1:28:42.750
This is gonna be a little complicated

1:28:42.750 --> 1:28:43.823
so just bear with me.

1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:49.920
I saw him and I saw
Darren Mitchell that night

1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:51.473
together.
- You saw, okay.

1:28:52.490 --> 1:28:54.520
Both of them in the basement, right?

1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:55.353
In the old science building.

1:28:55.353 --> 1:28:58.120
- I saw them both at the same time.

1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:00.750
- So you believe that Zardonicus took him?

1:29:00.750 --> 1:29:01.583
- No.

1:29:03.470 --> 1:29:04.450
- I'm sorry, I'm just,

1:29:04.450 --> 1:29:05.283
I'm having a hard time following.

1:29:05.283 --> 1:29:08.270
- No, I'm not good at explaining this.

1:29:08.270 --> 1:29:11.133
You know these guys.

1:29:13.115 --> 1:29:15.705
Professor Zardonicus is a good example.

1:29:15.705 --> 1:29:18.100
- Like Big Foot?
- Big Foot, Loch Ness Monster.

1:29:18.100 --> 1:29:18.933
- Okay.

1:29:18.933 --> 1:29:20.814
- We have all of these guys

1:29:20.814 --> 1:29:23.720
and they're not creatures
and monsters to us.

1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:25.600
That's not why we care.

1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:28.523
It's that they're Rorschach tests, really.

1:29:29.690 --> 1:29:32.780
It's that they are what
we need them to be.

1:29:32.780 --> 1:29:34.843
And Professor Zardonicus,

1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:39.670
Darren needed him to be real.

1:29:39.670 --> 1:29:41.280
He needed that.

1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:44.762
And so what he did was he made him real.

1:29:44.762 --> 1:29:46.610
- I mean, to me it just sounds like

1:29:46.610 --> 1:29:50.350
you think that Darren had
just dressed up as a monster.

1:29:50.350 --> 1:29:52.590
- I mean, I'm dressed up right now.

1:29:52.590 --> 1:29:54.440
You guys all here, you're dressed up.

1:29:55.750 --> 1:29:58.313
Right? Like--
- Yes.

1:29:59.670 --> 1:30:01.710
- It's all about appearances

1:30:01.710 --> 1:30:03.710
and it's all about becoming

1:30:03.710 --> 1:30:05.383
that thing you were meant to be.

1:30:07.132 --> 1:30:07.965
I mean,

1:30:09.550 --> 1:30:12.650
what I saw that night, it
was Professor Zardonicus.

1:30:12.650 --> 1:30:14.130
You may not wanna call him that,

1:30:14.130 --> 1:30:16.720
but that's what he was to me.

1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:18.340
- So you're essentially saying

1:30:18.340 --> 1:30:21.393
that Darren became Professor Zardonicus?

1:30:22.300 --> 1:30:26.580
- I'm saying that Darren realized

1:30:26.580 --> 1:30:29.063
to make something real
you have to believe.

1:30:30.370 --> 1:30:34.283
But to get people to
believe, it has to be real.

1:30:35.170 --> 1:30:37.350
- I do not wish to harm the Professor

1:30:37.350 --> 1:30:39.313
or judge him in any way.

1:30:40.220 --> 1:30:41.890
But my allegiance is to the truth

1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:44.060
and the truth I shall have

1:30:45.037 --> 1:30:46.663
at all costs.

1:30:51.290 --> 1:30:52.700
Was that good or...

1:30:53.657 --> 1:30:57.530
I mean, I felt like it
was pretty good overall.

1:30:57.530 --> 1:30:59.443
I don't think it was too rehearsed.

1:31:01.347 --> 1:31:02.240
Yeah.

1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:03.386
All right.

1:31:03.386 --> 1:31:04.614
You wanna just?
