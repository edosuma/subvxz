(mellow music playing)

01:05.133 --> 01:07.333
Girls, I'm so sorry to be late.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.066
I ran out of gas coming home.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.367
It was just horrible.

01:11.433 --> 01:13.867
Nobody would stop to help.

01:13.934 --> 01:16.533
This couldn't have happened
in the old south.

01:17.033 --> 01:21.400
What's become of chivalry,
when men used to open doors for you,

01:21.467 --> 01:24.533
pull out your chair,
tip their hat, kiss your hand,

01:24.600 --> 01:29.667
help you out of carriages,
leave calling cards on silver salvers?

01:30.266 --> 01:33.900
How far back do you want to go?
You still want to be able to vote?

01:35.667 --> 01:39.867
It's unbelievable it's empty.
Yesterday, the tank was half full.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.867
Maybe the gauge is broken.

01:41.934 --> 01:45.100
It's all those foreign cars,
they're unreliable.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.100
(chuckles)
Ma, Blanche drives a Buick.

01:48.166 --> 01:51.066
So? I'm from Sicily.
To me a Buick is a foreign car.

01:53.066 --> 01:55.967
Oh, but I haven't told you
my wonderful news.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.934
My mother-in-law died.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.300
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:02.367 --> 02:03.800
Well, I'm not.

02:03.867 --> 02:08.166
I loathed Mama Devereaux,
and the feeling was entirely mutual.

02:08.233 --> 02:13.100
Till the day George died, she always
introduced me as his first wife.

02:14.734 --> 02:16.900
I just hope the old witch went slowly.

02:18.567 --> 02:21.633
I sense the period of mourning is over.

02:21.700 --> 02:22.900
(laughs)

02:22.967 --> 02:25.900
I didn't tell you my really good news.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.867
Better than the dead mother-in-law?

02:28.700 --> 02:33.300
George's younger brother Jamie
is flying in tomorrow from Charleston

02:33.367 --> 02:35.633
to help settle my part of the estate.

02:35.700 --> 02:36.934
You're close?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.033
We were high-school classmates.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.200
I thought he was cute.

02:40.266 --> 02:43.934
Of course, I couldn't date
someone from my own class.

02:44.300 --> 02:47.100
I'd been dating seniors since I was 12.

02:48.633 --> 02:51.266
I had my reputation to consider.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.333
Shut up, Ma.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.567
After George and I were married,

02:58.633 --> 03:02.000
I began to realize
Jamie had this yen for me.

03:02.066 --> 03:07.066
Poor boy, trapped in a seething cauldron
of forbidden passion

03:07.133 --> 03:09.000
for his gorgeous sister-in-law.

03:10.367 --> 03:13.700
There were nights
when he actually bayed at the moon.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.166
(scoffs)

03:19.266 --> 03:23.166
But he finally realized
I was totally committed to George,

03:23.233 --> 03:26.600
so he threw himself into a marriage
that was doomed to failure.

03:26.667 --> 03:30.233
After 20 years,
they realized they had nothing in common.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.633
Can't wait for him to see how good I look.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.500
Jamie may not see this as a happy reunion.

03:38.567 --> 03:41.066
After all, he just lost his mother.

03:41.533 --> 03:44.133
And I ran out of gas. Life goes on.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.867
In my Sicilian village we had a custom.

03:48.934 --> 03:52.266
If your mother-in-law died,
you were forced to wear a hair shirt,

03:52.333 --> 03:55.233
eat dirt, and pound your head on a rock,

03:56.467 --> 03:58.200
anything to keep you from laughing.

04:00.266 --> 04:00.934
Mmm.

04:01.934 --> 04:04.934
(mellow music playing)

04:09.033 --> 04:11.834
I can't believe
I'm going to see Jamie again.

04:12.233 --> 04:15.100
The last time I saw him
was at George's funeral.

04:15.166 --> 04:19.166
I didn't look all that good.
Red is such a bad color on me.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.633
You wore red to George's funeral?

04:23.700 --> 04:25.367
George liked red.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.767
I thought I looked terrible,
but the pictures were fine.

04:30.567 --> 04:33.433
-(doorbell rings)
-That must be him.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.834
How do I look?

04:34.900 --> 04:35.767
Nervous.

04:35.834 --> 04:38.767
I am. My heart's pounding away.

04:38.834 --> 04:40.633
Take a deep breath.

04:40.700 --> 04:45.367
I always do before I greet a man.
It thrusts my breasts forward.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.266
Blanche...

04:53.166 --> 04:56.300
Honey, you always did look pretty
when you held your breath.

04:56.367 --> 04:57.200
(laughs)

04:58.934 --> 04:59.834
Jamie.

04:59.900 --> 05:00.667
(sighs)

05:00.734 --> 05:02.734
Why do you look so stricken?

05:02.800 --> 05:06.400
Not because mother's dead?
You two couldn't stand each other.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.200
I'd forgotten how much you look
like George and sound like him.

05:11.266 --> 05:13.066
I can't help it. I'm his brother.

05:13.133 --> 05:15.467
-(laughs)
-Introduce me.

05:15.533 --> 05:16.200
To who?

05:18.100 --> 05:18.800
Oh!

05:18.867 --> 05:20.400
Where are my manners?

05:20.467 --> 05:23.066
Jamie, these are my friends
Dorothy and Rose.

05:23.133 --> 05:24.433
-How do you do, ladies?
-Hello, Jamie.

05:24.500 --> 05:28.633
In her infrequent letters, Blanche has
spoken of you both in glowing terms.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.633
I'm lucky to get to know you personally.

05:31.700 --> 05:34.000
Well, thank you, kind sir.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.900
You'll have to excuse Rose.

05:36.967 --> 05:41.233
Every time a man speaks southern at her,
she goes all... stupid.

05:44.767 --> 05:48.133
Oh, Jamie, so good to see you again.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.433
Glad to see you,
even if it is only for the weekend.

05:51.767 --> 05:54.600
The business with the will
shouldn't take long.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.400
I shouldn't think so.

05:56.467 --> 05:59.867
I'd hardly expect mama Devereaux
to leave me the family silver.

05:59.934 --> 06:00.600
Oh!

06:00.667 --> 06:03.700
As her executor,
I went over her will with her,

06:03.767 --> 06:06.000
the list of beneficiaries.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.834
She was pretty far gone then.

06:07.900 --> 06:12.934
When we got to your name, she kept
repeating in this weak little voice,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.033
"I want her to have it."

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Well, I am surprised.

06:20.066 --> 06:22.266
She was talking about her disease.

06:28.100 --> 06:31.333
I've got to get going.

06:31.867 --> 06:34.000
Blanche has consented
to have lunch with me.

06:34.066 --> 06:35.633
Would you ladies care to join us?

06:36.500 --> 06:38.500
Oh, no. That's okay.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.900
You two probably have
a great deal to talk over.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.333
Pleasure meeting you. See y'all later.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.100
It was our pleasure.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.200
See y'all.

06:48.967 --> 06:53.266
I love the girls,
but they don't seem as old as you said.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.467
It's the lighting.

06:55.033 --> 06:56.033
(chuckles)

06:57.734 --> 06:59.300
What a charming man.

06:59.367 --> 07:01.533
And so handsome.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.033
As they say in St. Olaf, va-va-va-voom!

07:07.333 --> 07:08.867
Is that where that comes from?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.734
It's my day to get groceries.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.700
God, I hate going to the supermarket.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.567
If you'd stop playing
express line detective,

07:17.633 --> 07:19.200
people would stop yelling at you.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.367
So, when you're in line reading TV guide

07:24.433 --> 07:27.867
and toss it on top of 10 items,
I'm supposed to look the other way?

07:27.934 --> 07:29.533
I think not, Dorothy.

07:31.867 --> 07:32.533
(door closes)

07:36.133 --> 07:38.133
Dorothy, my car is gone!

07:38.200 --> 07:40.300
-What?
-My car's been stolen.

07:40.367 --> 07:42.367
Slow down.

07:42.433 --> 07:44.433
You probably just forgot
where you parked it.

07:44.500 --> 07:49.300
-It's stolen. I'm calling the cops.
-Don't call the police.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.834
-How come?
-They told you don't call again.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.133
Call the neighborhood patrol.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.800
If it actually was stolen,
one of their cars will probably spot it.

08:00.266 --> 08:01.533
The phone book is missing.

08:02.033 --> 08:04.133
Car's missing. Phone book's missing.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.934
If you had a car phone,
this would come together.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.934
You might show a little compassion.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.567
Catch me on a day
when the story's about me.

08:15.734 --> 08:17.333
What's with Rose?

08:17.400 --> 08:19.333
Rose thinks her car's been stolen.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.834
It hasn't. It's parked right outside.

08:21.900 --> 08:22.734
(door closes)

08:28.867 --> 08:29.967
Ma's right.

08:30.033 --> 08:33.266
It wasn't there a minute ago. I swear.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.867
How can it be gone one minute
and back the next?

08:39.266 --> 08:40.633
I think I know.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.834
Ma, why are you carrying that phone book?

08:43.900 --> 08:46.200
I can carry a book. It's a free country.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.133
The Statue of Liberty carries one.

08:49.867 --> 08:51.967
-You were driving again.
-Who says?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.033
This phone book's warm.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.100
You sat on it
to see over the steering wheel.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.600
You know me, safety first.

09:00.934 --> 09:03.033
You stole my car?

09:03.100 --> 09:04.333
Only for two hours.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.066
If I'd asked, would you have said yes?

09:06.133 --> 09:07.100
No.

09:07.166 --> 09:08.100
There you go.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.900
That's why Blanche ran out of gas.

09:11.967 --> 09:14.300
You've been driving her car.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.467
Know how embarrassing it is driving a car

09:16.533 --> 09:20.066
with a bumper sticker that says,
"So many men, so little time"?

09:22.967 --> 09:25.000
But, Ma, you don't have a license.

09:25.066 --> 09:26.266
I have a license.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.300
It expired years ago.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.166
I had it renewed.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.467
I forbid you to do this.

09:32.533 --> 09:35.166
-Why?
-Because you drive like Mr. Magoo.

09:37.533 --> 09:42.200
I don't understand why suddenly
you decided to start driving again.

09:42.266 --> 09:43.867
I had a blind date.

09:44.567 --> 09:46.533
Actually, he's just legally blind.

09:47.667 --> 09:51.700
Mr. Pignoli, good-looking, funny,

09:51.767 --> 09:53.900
and he can't see his hand
in front of his face.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.800
He's happy if I just brush my teeth.

09:58.633 --> 10:02.000
If you needed a ride,
we'd be happy to give you lifts.

10:02.066 --> 10:04.400
Make me happy.
Toss the Bobby Vinton tapes.

10:04.467 --> 10:06.500
I have enough trouble staying awake
when driving.

10:08.433 --> 10:11.000
I didn't want to say this
but I'm going to.

10:11.467 --> 10:15.400
Your eyesight is not what it used to be
and neither are your reflexes,

10:15.467 --> 10:17.433
and I want you to make me a promise.

10:17.500 --> 10:22.400
If you want to drive, let me know,
and I'll go with you.

10:22.467 --> 10:23.266
You promise?

10:23.734 --> 10:26.467
Promise!
Why not ask me to sign it in blood?

10:28.100 --> 10:29.600
What happened to trust?

10:29.667 --> 10:31.767
You don't want me driving, fine.

10:31.834 --> 10:33.567
But don't ask me to promise.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.467
Don't humiliate me.

10:35.934 --> 10:38.533
Leave me with what little dignity
I have left.

10:38.600 --> 10:42.200
Mom, I'm sorry.
Honey, of course I trust you.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.100
What a pigeon.

10:48.333 --> 10:51.333
(quirky music playing)

10:59.867 --> 11:02.667
My God. If they want to make spies talk,

11:02.734 --> 11:05.834
they should force them
to grade Junior High English essays.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.533
Kids today
can't write the English language.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.066
"The characters in <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>
are so real that it's interesting."

11:17.200 --> 11:17.934
Weren't they?

11:21.100 --> 11:22.100
(footsteps approaching)

11:22.800 --> 11:24.100
Afternoon, all.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.500
How was lunch with Jamie?

11:25.567 --> 11:27.300
It was magical.

11:27.367 --> 11:30.000
We talked for hours, all about George.

11:30.066 --> 11:33.734
How George loved me,

11:33.800 --> 11:35.734
how George used to have to save his money

11:35.800 --> 11:38.200
so he could buy presents
good enough for me.

11:38.266 --> 11:40.934
Oh, it felt so good talking about George.

11:42.867 --> 11:45.200
Almost seemed to bring him back to life.

11:45.266 --> 11:48.100
It made me realize why,

11:48.166 --> 11:51.600
from the time I saw him
till the day he died,

11:51.667 --> 11:54.266
there was never, never another man.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.667
Oh, Blanche, you?

11:55.734 --> 11:57.066
You were never tempted?

11:57.767 --> 11:58.667
Never.

11:59.667 --> 12:01.166
Didn't you have your milk delivered?

12:09.767 --> 12:13.433
The uncanny thing
is how much like George Jamie is.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.266
It's not just looking
and talking like him,

12:16.333 --> 12:19.734
he's gentle like George,
and he's thoughtful like George.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.433
He's smart and funny like George.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.834
Sometimes I get this eerie feeling

12:24.900 --> 12:28.033
that George has actually walked back
into my life.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.033
Oh, Rose, Dorothy.

12:30.433 --> 12:31.900
I'm falling in love.

12:32.367 --> 12:33.934
Novelty night.

12:36.934 --> 12:41.734
My female instincts tell me
Jamie feels the same about me.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.400
It wouldn't surprise me if one day soon,

12:44.467 --> 12:49.300
Mrs. Blanche Devereaux
were to become Mrs. Blanche Devereaux.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.400
I'll alert the mailman.

12:55.934 --> 12:59.533
(mellow music playing)

13:00.000 --> 13:03.800
(lively music playing)

13:03.867 --> 13:07.600
Don't you think it's crazy
that Blanche is gonna marry him?

13:07.667 --> 13:08.500
Why?

13:08.567 --> 13:10.867
They grew up together.

13:10.934 --> 13:13.266
They've known each other
most of their lives.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.967
It's comfortable.

13:15.033 --> 13:16.266
He's like an old friend.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.900
But he's her late husband's brother.

13:18.967 --> 13:24.433
I remember in St. Olaf when Inga Ingstrom
married her late husband's brother Lars.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.967
The whole town was shocked.

13:26.633 --> 13:28.400
Of course,
that could have been because at the time,

13:28.467 --> 13:31.500
Inga was on trial for her late husband's
dismemberment.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.867
It was probably a factor.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.000
The trial went on for months.

13:39.066 --> 13:41.433
Fees cost her an arm and a leg.

13:48.467 --> 13:51.467
Rose, get to the part
where they steal the brain

13:51.533 --> 13:52.734
and sew it into your head.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.934
So anyway, she got a suspended sentence.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.400
They let her go?

14:00.467 --> 14:02.200
-No, they hanged her.
-(grunts)

14:08.800 --> 14:10.133
I'm going to sleep.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.000
I don't know how long I've got,

14:12.066 --> 14:14.967
but I deserve better company
in my final years.

14:17.000 --> 14:17.967
Good night, Ma.

14:19.433 --> 14:22.300
You know, Rose,
Blanche has the right idea,

14:22.367 --> 14:24.300
marrying someone she knows.

14:24.367 --> 14:28.000
It's makes it easier,
sharing a history together.

14:28.066 --> 14:31.166
It helps knowing each other's
idiosyncrasies.

14:31.467 --> 14:34.133
I don't think stan and I
would ever have gotten together

14:34.200 --> 14:38.033
had I known his entire family
smells their fingers all day

14:38.100 --> 14:39.433
after they eat chicken.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.300
Well, I still think
Blanche is making a terrible mistake.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.533
What mistake?

14:56.600 --> 15:00.166
Trusting that her two best friends
won't badmouth her behind her back?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.166
Honey, that's not it.

15:02.233 --> 15:03.567
We're a family.

15:03.633 --> 15:07.367
When a member of the family
thinks she might move out,

15:07.433 --> 15:12.133
we might be happy for her,
but it's a little upsetting.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.000
If you're worried about the house,
don't be.

15:16.066 --> 15:21.400
If I move to Charleston,
you can stay here as long as you like.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.600
Blanche, that's so sweet of you.

15:23.667 --> 15:26.367
Blanche, that's not what concerns us.

15:26.433 --> 15:27.233
It's not?

15:30.367 --> 15:32.700
We're concerned about losing you.

15:32.767 --> 15:34.100
Oh, right.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.333
I don't want to lose you, either.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.734
I have a wonderful idea.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.433
Why don't you come to Charleston
and live with me?

15:46.033 --> 15:48.233
I... No, we couldn't do that.

15:48.834 --> 15:50.433
Of course, you can.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.967
It's settled. I won't hear another word.

15:53.767 --> 15:56.166
Why,
you know it's an old southern tradition

15:56.233 --> 16:01.266
for the beautiful married daughter
to take in her pathetic spinster sisters.

16:05.333 --> 16:09.000
When she puts it that way,
it's hard to resist.

16:09.633 --> 16:12.667
(mellow music playing)

16:17.300 --> 16:18.567
Finished.

16:18.967 --> 16:21.600
I have graded the last paper.

16:21.934 --> 16:24.400
D-minus? You're giving a D-minus?

16:24.467 --> 16:28.433
That's because substitute teachers
can't impose the death penalty.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.567
(laughs)

16:31.033 --> 16:34.000
Well, since Blanche is having dinner
with Jamie,

16:34.066 --> 16:36.333
we have a very important decision to make.

16:37.367 --> 16:38.133
How about pizza?

16:38.200 --> 16:39.900
-Sounds great.
-(laughs)

16:40.700 --> 16:43.734
Shall we go healthy
and get low-fat cheese?

16:43.800 --> 16:47.567
Let's go high fiber
and spread ketchup on cardboard.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.567
Pizza, damn it, get pizza!

16:53.166 --> 16:55.500
The phone book is missing again.

16:55.567 --> 16:58.633
-Where's Ma?
-Is my car gone?

17:00.600 --> 17:03.567
Your car's fine. My car's gone.

17:03.633 --> 17:05.767
(telephone rings)

17:06.467 --> 17:07.166
Yes?

17:08.100 --> 17:09.400
Yes, she does.

17:11.934 --> 17:13.734
There's been an accident.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.834
(somber music playing)

17:21.233 --> 17:23.367
You promised you wouldn't drive alone.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.667
I can't believe you lied.

17:25.734 --> 17:30.400
I've always lied to you.
Did you ever get the pony I promised?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.533
You're not taking this accident seriously.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.633
It was his fault. I have a witness.

17:37.700 --> 17:41.300
Your witness is Mr. Pignoli.
He's legally blind.

17:41.834 --> 17:43.433
He'll say what I tell him.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.700
What's the big deal?

17:44.767 --> 17:47.166
You should not be driving.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.600
You're revoking my license?

17:48.667 --> 17:50.333
And your telephone book.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.767
It's for your own good, Ma.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.100
You're ruining my life.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.700
We can drive you anywhere.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.300
I'll really want you along on dates.

17:59.767 --> 18:01.900
Ma, try to be reasonable.

18:01.967 --> 18:04.300
Sheila Patterson's daughter
lets her drive.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.900
I'm not Sheila Patterson's daughter.

18:06.967 --> 18:09.200
I'm going to my room.

18:09.266 --> 18:11.200
Oh, Ma.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.333
(groans)

18:13.400 --> 18:17.166
I have a sense of Deja Vu
from when I was 14,

18:17.233 --> 18:19.433
except I'm Ma and she's me.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.300
What will you do?

18:22.367 --> 18:25.567
I've got to be firm.
I won't let her go to the prom.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
(mellow music playing)

18:33.667 --> 18:34.800
(both laugh)

18:34.867 --> 18:38.767
I'll never forget
High School Biology class

18:38.834 --> 18:40.367
when we were studying the octopus.

18:40.433 --> 18:41.266
(gasps)

18:41.333 --> 18:44.433
I swear I meant to say eight tentacles.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.033
You didn't.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.467
(laughing)

18:49.033 --> 18:53.033
Any girl who says that
and doesn't blush knows what she's saying.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.000
(laughs)

18:54.066 --> 18:56.934
You were the only thing
that kept me awake.

18:57.734 --> 18:59.633
To old friends.

18:59.967 --> 19:00.767
(chuckles)

19:00.834 --> 19:02.867
I wish you weren't leaving tomorrow.

19:02.934 --> 19:03.967
So do I.

19:04.033 --> 19:06.567
Stay on a few days.

19:06.633 --> 19:09.567
I'm meeting a client
first thing Monday morning.

19:09.633 --> 19:12.166
Then I'll go back with you.

19:12.233 --> 19:13.300
Say again?

19:13.367 --> 19:14.033
(chuckles)

19:14.834 --> 19:17.834
I know how I feel about you.

19:17.900 --> 19:22.133
I flatter myself to think
you feel the same way about me.

19:22.200 --> 19:27.734
I could be coy,
I could drop hints, but I'm past that.

19:29.066 --> 19:33.633
Jamie, when George died,
I began to feel...

19:34.166 --> 19:35.467
incomplete.

19:36.567 --> 19:41.133
I tried to find what was missing.
I tried to find it in another man...

19:41.767 --> 19:42.834
Men.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.100
Many, many men.

19:51.467 --> 19:53.600
But it wasn't there.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.300
Then you happened,

19:55.367 --> 20:00.367
and it was as if George had just stepped
right back into my life again.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.066
I don't want to feel
that incompleteness again.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.633
(laughs)
Oh, listen to me.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.633
Am I carrying on? Wonder what got into me.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.934
I said I wouldn't be coy, and I won't.

20:14.433 --> 20:17.467
I'm going to say what I mean, what I feel.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.266
I'm in love with you, Jamie.

20:22.734 --> 20:25.333
Well, Blanche, darling.

20:26.567 --> 20:28.467
I do feel something for you.

20:28.533 --> 20:30.133
I guess I always have.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.500
I knew it.

20:32.133 --> 20:35.900
But I don't believe it's love,
not the way you mean it.

20:37.333 --> 20:41.667
All we've talked about tonight
and ever since I got here is George.

20:42.633 --> 20:43.633
I loved him, too.

20:43.700 --> 20:48.000
I tried to be just like him,
but I couldn't.

20:48.867 --> 20:51.533
I couldn't then, and I can't be him now.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.934
You're in love with a memory
I brought back.

20:55.767 --> 20:57.367
I certainly am not.

20:57.433 --> 21:02.066
I'm well in touch with my feelings,
and I know my mind, George.

21:02.133 --> 21:05.300
You're talking nonsense. Take it back now.

21:05.367 --> 21:06.166
Jamie.

21:07.166 --> 21:07.834
What?

21:08.333 --> 21:10.100
You called me George.

21:11.567 --> 21:15.433
Don't you think I'd know
if I'd called you Jamie, George?

21:15.500 --> 21:18.633
I mean, George, Jamie.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.367
Oh, Jamie, George, what's the difference?

21:21.433 --> 21:23.500
There is a difference, Blanche.

21:24.633 --> 21:26.100
You're just so much like him.

21:26.567 --> 21:28.100
But I'm not him.

21:29.433 --> 21:30.100
(chuckles)

21:30.800 --> 21:32.066
I feel like a fool.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.433
Oh, Blanche, honey.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.667
It's never foolish to hold on to a memory.

21:38.533 --> 21:40.533
Sometimes, it's all we're left with.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.633
I miss him so much.

21:44.367 --> 21:45.066
I know.

21:46.133 --> 21:47.200
I miss him, too.

21:48.467 --> 21:51.467
(somber music playing)

21:57.800 --> 21:59.333
Morning, everybody.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.800
You okay?

22:00.867 --> 22:05.166
I stopped crying a couple hours ago.
I waited for the puffiness to disappear.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.133
You had us worried.

22:08.200 --> 22:13.066
I cried and cried, then I realized
what I'd been crying about.

22:13.133 --> 22:15.633
It wasn't about me or Jamie.

22:16.166 --> 22:17.800
It was about George.

22:18.367 --> 22:20.300
And I cried enough for George
when he died.

22:20.367 --> 22:23.033
I decided to rejoin the living.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.900
That's our Blanche.

22:25.367 --> 22:28.834
I'm strolling past that mini-mall
they're building.

22:28.900 --> 22:29.567
Why?

22:29.633 --> 22:33.066
Passing construction sites
is good for your morale.

22:36.066 --> 22:37.967
The sound of guys in hard hats

22:38.033 --> 22:40.500
making that sucking noise
through their teeth...

22:42.867 --> 22:44.834
It makes me feel like a lady again.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.567
(lively music playing)

22:54.600 --> 22:57.633
(closing theme music playing)
