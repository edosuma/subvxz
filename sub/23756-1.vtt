00:17.583 --> 00:20.540
Soon after its premiere,
the film Metropolis

00:20.666 --> 00:23.749
was severely truncated
and alterations were made.

00:23.875 --> 00:26.915
From that time onward,
more than a quarter of the film

00:27.041 --> 00:30.124
was assumed to have been lost.

00:30.250 --> 00:33.332
Then, in 2008, a virtually complete
version of the film

00:33.458 --> 00:36.540
was discovered in Buenos Aires.
What had been preserved

00:36.666 --> 00:39.749
was, however, a heavily damaged
copy of the film

00:39.875 --> 00:42.915
that had been printed to 16mm
film stock,

00:43.041 --> 00:47.207
lacking the full frame
of the picture's original aspect ratio.

00:47.791 --> 00:51.707
A considerable amount of the film
reconstruction was able to be completed

00:51.833 --> 00:54.207
and the correct sequence
of its editing

00:54.333 --> 00:57.124
established by means
of this Argentinian material.

00:57.250 --> 01:00.249
Spanish intertitles have been translated
into German

01:00.375 --> 01:02.374
with the aid of the censor-cards.

01:02.500 --> 01:06.415
In order to display in their correct
position on the image

01:06.541 --> 01:09.332
the cropped elements taken
from the 16mm negative,

01:09.458 --> 01:12.290
the missing portion of the frame
has been marked by black.

01:13.083 --> 01:16.832
The intertitles appear
with their original graphic treatment.

01:16.958 --> 01:20.790
Those titles which appear in a different
typeface (like the one used here)

01:20.916 --> 01:24.374
have been added to summarise
the content of still-missing scenes

01:24.500 --> 01:26.332
as far as is necessary
to facilitate

01:26.458 --> 01:28.707
an adequate understanding
of the storyline.

01:28.833 --> 01:31.957
Shorter gaps are indicated
by small segments of black leader.

01:32.250 --> 01:39.290

and is distributed courtesy of Parufamet.

and in book form

Epigraph:

02:45.333 --> 02:50.915
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

03:58.000 --> 04:01.290
Shift change.

05:19.208 --> 05:22.332
Deep beneath

05:22.458 --> 05:25.999
the earth lay the

05:26.125 --> 05:30.207
City of the Workers.

06:39.916 --> 06:45.499
As deep beneath the earth
as the City of the Workers lay,

06:45.625 --> 06:51.249
so high above it towered the complex
known as the "Sons' Club",

06:51.375 --> 06:56.957
with its lecture halls and libraries,
its theatres and stadiums.

07:30.041 --> 07:34.374
Fathers, for whom every revolution
of a mechanical wheel meant gold,

07:34.500 --> 07:39.249
had bestowed upon their sons
the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.

07:58.833 --> 08:02.165
Which of you ladies shall today

08:02.291 --> 08:07.124
have the honour of entertaining Master Freder,
Joh Fredersen's son?

10:46.291 --> 10:50.415
Look! These are your brothers!

10:53.000 --> 10:55.832
Look - !

11:03.083 --> 11:06.374
These are your brothers!

12:35.875 --> 12:39.165
Who - was that?

13:28.333 --> 13:30.749
But this was what happened to Freder -

13:30.875 --> 13:34.332
the son of Joh Fredersen,
the master of Metropolis -

13:34.458 --> 13:37.124
as he sought out the girl:

17:43.833 --> 17:47.957
To the new Tower of Babel -
to my father - !

21:38.083 --> 21:43.499
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion
from my son, and not from you - !

21:51.458 --> 21:54.749
Details - !

23:07.083 --> 23:12.457
What were you looking for
in the Machine-Halls, Freder?

23:15.166 --> 23:21.790
I wanted to look into the faces of the people
whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...

23:48.500 --> 23:50.832
Your magnificent city, Father -

23:50.958 --> 23:55.124
and you the brain of this city -
and all of us within the light of this city... -

24:22.416 --> 24:26.540
...and where are the people, Father,
whose hands built your city - ?

24:32.416 --> 24:36.540
Off where they belong...

24:43.416 --> 24:46.374
...off where they belong...?

24:51.416 --> 24:54.957
...in the Depths...?

25:30.291 --> 25:35.249
And if those in the Depths
one day rise against you?

26:07.250 --> 26:12.207
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, -
with an important message...

26:33.166 --> 26:38.124
There were two more copies
of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen...

27:19.125 --> 27:24.082
...in the pockets of two men who met
with an accident today at the M-Machine...

27:38.208 --> 27:44.832
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans
were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?

28:09.166 --> 28:14.124
Apply to the G-Bank
for your remaining wages...

29:19.125 --> 29:23.165
Father, do you know what it means
to be dismissed by you? -

29:23.291 --> 29:27.415
It means: To be sent below! -
Father - below! Into the Depths - !

30:40.125 --> 30:46.749
Do you know what it means to be dismissed
like that by Joh Fredersen?

31:05.166 --> 31:09.290
Would you like to come with me,
Josaphat?

31:49.833 --> 31:58.124
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight...

32:09.416 --> 32:14.374
Into the Depths, -
to my brothers...

32:22.750 --> 32:29.374
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed
of my son's every move...

33:44.750 --> 33:46.790
Brother...

33:57.166 --> 34:02.165
...the Machine! There needs
to be someone at the Machine!

34:07.666 --> 34:12.623
There will be someone at the machine...

34:12.750 --> 34:14.706
ME.

34:26.458 --> 34:31.415
Listen to me...
I want to trade my life with you...

35:03.208 --> 35:08.124
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

35:13.583 --> 35:17.707
Wait for me -
both of you...

35:48.541 --> 36:08.957
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

38:01.375 --> 38:03.874
In the middle of Metropolis,

38:04.000 --> 38:08.499
there stands a strange house
that the centuries had overlooked.

38:15.041 --> 38:20.415
The man who dwelled within
was Rotwang, the inventor.

39:38.916 --> 39:40.915
Hel

39:41.041 --> 39:45.499
Born to bring me happiness
and a benediction to all mankind.

39:45.625 --> 39:50.124
Lost to Joh Fredersen.
Died giving life to Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.

40:16.375 --> 40:21.040
A mind like yours, Rotwang,
should be able to forget...

40:26.083 --> 40:32.707
Only one time in life did I forget something:
that Hel was a woman - and you a man...

40:38.708 --> 40:43.665
Let the dead lie, Rotwang...
She's dead for you as she is for me...

40:51.375 --> 40:56.332
For me she isn't dead, Joh Fredersen -
for me she lives - !

41:06.083 --> 41:14.374
Do you think the loss of a hand
is too high a price for recreating Hel - ?!

41:20.958 --> 41:24.249
Do you wish to see her - ?!

43:26.041 --> 43:28.832
Now, Joh Fredersen - ?!

43:28.958 --> 43:32.915
Isn't it worth losing a hand
to have created the man of the future -

43:33.041 --> 43:35.124
the Machine-Man - ?!

43:42.708 --> 43:46.540
24 more hours of work -

43:46.666 --> 43:51.832
and no man, Joh Fredersen, will be able
to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal - !

44:11.875 --> 44:17.374
The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen!
Hel's son was yours!

44:44.541 --> 44:49.499
And what brings you my way,
Joh Fredersen?

45:00.208 --> 45:06.832
I need your advice -
as usual, when all my experts fail me...

45:20.166 --> 45:23.082
Can you decipher for me these plans

45:23.208 --> 45:28.457
that for months have been getting discovered
in the pockets of my workers?

46:03.875 --> 46:08.832
...at two... once my shift ends!
She has summoned us again...

47:35.291 --> 47:41.915
Father - ! Father - !
Will ten hours never come to an end - ??! !

48:12.500 --> 48:16.540
- it's a blueprint
of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs

48:16.666 --> 48:20.790
deep below the lowest levels
of your Metropolis...

48:56.041 --> 49:04.207
I should like to glean what my workers
are doing exactly in those catacombs...

52:28.208 --> 52:30.624
Today I shall tell you

52:30.750 --> 52:34.915
the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...

52:35.041 --> 52:40.707
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL

52:50.708 --> 52:56.915
Come! Let us build a tower
whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!

53:00.166 --> 53:03.749
And at the tower's zenith we shall write:

53:03.875 --> 53:08.457
Great is the world and its Maker!
And great is Man!

53:28.541 --> 53:31.665
...but those who had conceived
of the Tower of Babel

53:31.791 --> 53:34.082
could not build the Tower of Babel.

53:34.208 --> 53:38.874
The task was too great.
So they paid wages to outside hands...

53:56.166 --> 54:01.249
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel
knew nothing of the dream

54:01.375 --> 54:06.540
of which the head that had conceived it
had been fantasising.

54:34.750 --> 54:39.374
The hymns of praise of one man
became the curses of others.

54:52.625 --> 54:58.832
The same language was spoken,
but these men did not understand one another...

55:06.666 --> 55:14.499
Great is the world and its Maker
and great is Man

55:30.166 --> 55:34.290
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.

55:36.750 --> 55:42.957
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

56:12.041 --> 56:16.999
And where is our Mediator,
Maria - ?

56:37.250 --> 56:42.207
Wait for him!
He will surely come!

56:57.583 --> 57:02.540
We will wait, Maria...!
But not for much longer - !

58:51.500 --> 58:56.457
Oh Mediator,
have you finally come...

58:59.250 --> 59:04.207
You summoned me -
here I am!

59:35.041 --> 59:41.665
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man
the likeness of this woman...

59:50.791 --> 59:54.832
I shall sow discord
between them and her!

59:54.958 --> 59:59.082
I shall destroy their belief
in this woman -

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:32.999
Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen...
You'll find the way back without me...

01:00:58.958 --> 01:01:03.624
You fool! Now you shall also lose
the last remaining thing you still had from Hel...

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:07.249
your son...

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:34.332
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:10.290
END OF THE PRELUDE

01:06:14.833 --> 01:06:18.624
INTERMEZZO

01:06:56.208 --> 01:07:00.040
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit
who preaches:

01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:05.040
"Verily, I say unto you: the days
of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!"

01:07:05.416 --> 01:07:09.457
The monk's hand points to the Bible,
in which it is written:

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:13.415
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured
beast, full of names of blasphemy,

01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:15.707
having seven heads and ten horns.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:19.499
And the woman was arrayed
in purple and scarlet colour,

01:07:19.625 --> 01:07:21.790
having a golden cup in her hand.

01:07:21.916 --> 01:07:25.582
And upon her forehead was a name
written, a mystery:

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:29.207
BABYLON THE GREAT, the Mother
of Abominations ofthe Earth.

01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:32.665
And I saw the woman drunken
with the blood ofthe Saints."

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:54.332
You will annihilate Joh Fredersen -
him and his city and his son - !

Had you come earlier,
you wouldn't have frightened me...

01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:14.749
I now beg of you: stay away from me
and my beloved...!

01:10:19.666 --> 01:10:24.082
Where is the one whose clothes
you are wearing?

01:10:38.208 --> 01:10:44.040
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:21.415
Would you please wake Georgy up?

01:11:21.541 --> 01:11:25.415
He must lead me
to the Workers' City at once...

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:52.124
No. 11811, get back to the Machine
and forget that you ever left it - understood?

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:16.790
I have to have someone
who's faithful to me, Josaphat, -

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:20.749
otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal
of my path - ?!

01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:51.124
I must go on, Josaphat, -
must now, on my own,

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:55.040
seek out the person to whom Georgy
was supposed to lead me...

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:03.624
Tonight, Josaphat -
tonight when I come back...

01:14:51.083 --> 01:14:56.624
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:41.707
So, what price are you demanding
for leaving this residence tonight?

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:33.040
You still don't seem to have grasped
who sent me here...

This man doesn't want his son

01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:43.707
In three hours' time
I shall be calling for you!

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:46.332
Come! It is time to give the Man-Machine
your face!

01:26:30.916 --> 01:26:34.999
Where is Maria - ?!

01:26:43.375 --> 01:26:48.290
She's with your father...

01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:10.040
I'm telling you,
she is with your father - !

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:15.790
"She is the most perfect and most obedient tool
that a man has ever possessed!

01:27:15.916 --> 01:27:19.915
Tonight you shall see how she holds up
before the eyes ofthe upper hundred.

01:27:20.041 --> 01:27:24.165
You shall see her dance, and if only one single
person recognises the machine in her,

01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:28.290
I will call myself a bungler
who never succeeded at anything!

01:27:28.416 --> 01:27:31.457

I want you to go to those in the Depths
in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!

"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen
to be his guest this evening."

01:32:03.958 --> 01:32:11.290
Verily, I say unto you: the days
of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh...!

01:33:22.125 --> 01:33:27.040
All Seven Deadly Sins,
on her behalf - !

01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:17.707

But for ten days your father's bloodhound
has been making the Workers' City unsafe...

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.082
The only thing keeping the workers in check

01:35:38.208 --> 01:35:42.415
is their expectation for the Mediator
promised unto them...

01:36:07.416 --> 01:36:12.707
Even stranger things
have been happening, Freder...

01:36:23.208 --> 01:36:27.790
On that evening when you fell ill...

01:36:38.458 --> 01:36:43.415
...once the best of friends...
because of that woman...

01:36:49.125 --> 01:36:54.040
...the other man...
on that same evening...

01:37:02.041 --> 01:37:08.624
...the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned...
but night after night in Yoshiwara...

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:51.082
And this woman,
at whose feet all sins are heaped...

01:37:51.416 --> 01:37:56.124
...is also called Maria...

01:38:04.416 --> 01:38:10.999
That same woman that those in the Depths
regard as a saint - ?!

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:28.832
Many now go to the City of the Dead,

01:38:28.958 --> 01:38:33.790
to a woman they have judged
to be as true as gold.

01:38:39.583 --> 01:38:43.999
The Mediator is not likely
to miss that occasion...

01:39:06.833 --> 01:39:10.165
Whatever happens tonight:

01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:14.415
it is my express order to allow the workers
to do as they please...

01:39:25.416 --> 01:39:30.707
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths
use force and do wrong

01:39:30.833 --> 01:39:36.165
so that he can claim the right
to use force against them...

01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:58.999
When you spoke to your poor brothers,
you talked about peace, Maria...

01:39:59.125 --> 01:40:04.499
today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen
incites them to rebel against him...

01:40:27.916 --> 01:40:32.832
She will destroy their belief
in the Mediator!

01:41:11.125 --> 01:41:17.707
You know I've always talked about peace...
but your Mediator hasn't come...

01:41:29.666 --> 01:41:34.582
You've waited long enough!
Your time has come - !

01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:45.040
...but I've tricked Joh Fredersen!

01:41:45.166 --> 01:41:49.540
Your clone does not obey his will -
only mine alone!

01:41:58.625 --> 01:42:05.249
Who is the living fodder
for the machines for Metropolis - ?!

01:42:09.833 --> 01:42:16.415
Who smears the machine-joints
with their own marrow - ?!

01:42:31.333 --> 01:42:36.249
Who feeds the machines
with their own flesh - ?!

01:42:43.041 --> 01:42:49.624
Let the machines starve, you fools - !
Finish them off - ! !

01:42:52.958 --> 01:42:57.874
Do them in -
these machines - ! !

01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:17.082
You aren't Maria - ! ! !

01:43:20.708 --> 01:43:23.040
YOU ARE NOT MARIA - !

01:43:37.583 --> 01:43:42.499
Maria talks of peace, not murder - !
This is not Maria - ! !

01:43:46.375 --> 01:43:51.332
Joh Fredersen's son - ! !

01:43:53.833 --> 01:44:00.415
Do him in, the dog,
in his white silken hide - ! ! !

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:35.540
Get your women, your sons,
out of the Workers' City!

01:44:35.666 --> 01:44:39.749
Let no-one stay behind!
Death to the machines - ! ! !

01:44:50.291 --> 01:44:52.457
In the attic of his home,

01:44:52.583 --> 01:44:56.165
Rotwang displays
for Maria his ever-growing intoxication

01:44:56.291 --> 01:44:58.374
with his triumph over Fredersen:

01:44:58.666 --> 01:45:00.874
" - and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen - !

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.915
For I concealed from him that his son
wants to be the Mediator of your brothers -

01:45:05.041 --> 01:45:06.915
and is in love with you - !"

01:45:07.208 --> 01:45:09.707
Maria isn't the only one listening to Rotwang.

01:45:09.833 --> 01:45:13.832
On the other side of the attic's window,
Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping...

01:45:14.291 --> 01:45:19.124
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him.

01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:22.582
Maria is free.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.082
...faithful after all...

01:46:12.125 --> 01:46:15.332
Come, Freder!
We still have to go through the Workers' City.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.665
Women and men,
let no-one miss out on today - !

01:46:52.791 --> 01:46:54.915
Death to the machines - ! !

01:49:03.708 --> 01:49:08.624
Not one man -
not one woman has stayed behind - !

01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:56.540
Leave the machines - !
Let them race to their death - !

01:50:05.041 --> 01:50:07.874
To the Heart-Machine - !

01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:20.957
DANGER

01:51:42.333 --> 01:51:44.624
Open the gates!

01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:55.624
You have to open the gates!

01:51:58.166 --> 01:52:00.874
If the Heart-Machine perishes,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.749
nothing in the Machine-District
will be left standing - ! !

01:52:52.875 --> 01:52:56.415
Have you lost your minds - ??

01:52:56.541 --> 01:53:01.999
If the Heart-Machine perishes,
the entire Workers' City will be laid to waste - ! !

01:58:52.583 --> 01:58:57.165
Where are your fathers,
your mothers?

01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:54.665
Do you have any idea that your son
is amongst the workers?!

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:37.415
Yes - you! You're Maria - !

02:01:48.250 --> 02:01:54.832
To the air shafts - quickly! Quickly!
The reservoirs have burst! The city is drowning - !

02:06:29.791 --> 02:06:34.707
We'll take the children
to the Sons' Club!

02:06:46.083 --> 02:06:51.040
Why are all the lights out?

02:07:13.875 --> 02:07:18.790
I need to know - !
Where is my son?! ! !

02:07:21.958 --> 02:07:25.665
Tomorrow thousands
will ask in fury and desperation:

02:07:25.791 --> 02:07:28.540
Joh Fredersen,
where is my son - ?!

02:08:13.375 --> 02:08:17.457
Where are your children??!

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.582
The city is drowned,
the shafts are totally flooded - ! !

02:08:39.416 --> 02:08:48.499
Who bade you attack the machines,
without which you're finished, you idiots - ??!

02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:58.332
It's the witch's fault - !

02:09:08.375 --> 02:09:12.707
We'll be looking on
as the world goes to the devil - !

02:09:53.875 --> 02:10:00.457
Find the witch; this is all her fault - !
Strike her dead - ! !

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:19.749
Now I'm going to take you home,
my Hel - !

02:12:33.125 --> 02:12:39.707
The witch - ! the witch - !
There she is - ! there she is - !

02:12:42.916 --> 02:12:49.499
Where are our children,
you witch, you - ??!

02:12:55.083 --> 02:13:01.665
Burn the witch. -
To the stake with her! ! !

02:14:55.875 --> 02:14:59.124
To the stake with her - ! !

02:17:24.958 --> 02:17:29.915
Hel - ! My Hel - ! !

02:21:18.416 --> 02:21:23.332
Your children... saved - ! ! !

02:25:25.708 --> 02:25:30.749
Head and hands want to join together,
but they don't have the heart to do it...

02:25:30.916 --> 02:25:34.790
Oh Mediator,
show them the way to one another...

02:26:14.541 --> 02:26:23.624
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
