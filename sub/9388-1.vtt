<i>We now return to Sunday Golf on CBS.</i>

00:07.110 --> 00:09.572
<i>And Mickelson here, trying to save par.</i>

00:09.600 --> 00:12.071
<i>And there's Mickelson's wife.
God, is she hot.</i>

00:12.097 --> 00:14.909
<i>Look at that rack.
There's a downhill lie for you.</i>

00:14.934 --> 00:18.081
<i>Oh, and they're just out there,
begging to be touched. Pleading.</i>

00:18.104 --> 00:20.427
<i>How many golf balls do you think
she can fit in her mouth?</i>

00:20.441 --> 00:22.702
<i>I'd hit that one in the rough,
if you know what I'm saying.</i>

00:22.723 --> 00:23.831
<i>Who are you kidding, Greg?</i>

00:23.858 --> 00:25.910
<i>You'd **** her for a week,
and then get tired her.</i>

00:25.925 --> 00:28.590
<i>Yeah, you're right. That's what I do.
That's my thing.</i>

00:28.634 --> 00:30.903
<i>- But a hell of a week though.
- Hell of a week.</i>

00:32.362 --> 00:34.436
Oh, my God! The power's out!

00:34.455 --> 00:36.091
What are we gonna do now?

00:36.119 --> 00:38.390
Well, we could light
some candles and read.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.093
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, that would be great

00:43.105 --> 00:44.853
Yeah. Read the inside of my butt.

00:44.886 --> 00:46.200
We could tell stories.

00:46.225 --> 00:48.691
Hey, Dad, why don't you tell
the story about when I was born?

00:48.705 --> 00:50.473
Yeah, we got halfway home
with the afterbirth

00:50.488 --> 00:52.912
before we had to go back to the hospital
and swap it out for Meg.

00:52.925 --> 00:53.562
The end.

00:53.576 --> 00:54.721
Now, I got a better one.

00:54.778 --> 00:57.221
This is a story of love and loss,

00:57.256 --> 00:58.590
fathers and sons,

00:58.617 --> 01:02.023
and a foresight to retain
international merchandising rights.

01:02.147 --> 01:03.871
This is the story

01:03.927 --> 01:05.453
of Star Wars.

03:25.017 --> 03:26.010
You hear that?

03:26.046 --> 03:27.880
Sounds like we're being boarded
from the rear.

03:27.896 --> 03:29.802
And not the, "Hey, take a deep breath,
let's experiment"

03:29.826 --> 03:30.911
kind of boarded from the rear.

03:30.927 --> 03:31.743
Beep boop.

03:32.118 --> 03:34.040
Could you hold on to this bag?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.702
What if they come in a different door?

04:06.908 --> 04:09.863
Damn! I was two days from retirement.

04:13.388 --> 04:14.592
R-2?

04:16.274 --> 04:19.452
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

04:19.487 --> 04:22.481
- All right, now what do I click?
- Click "preferences."

04:22.548 --> 04:26.652
- Okay, I clicked preferences.
- Now go to "default media browser".

04:26.696 --> 04:30.952
Okay, there's a little hourglass,
and it's not letting me do anything.

04:30.976 --> 04:33.830
- It says "buffering." What is that?
- Just give it a minute.

04:33.858 --> 04:35.840
All I'm trying to do is make an mpeg.

04:35.867 --> 04:38.171
All I'm trying to do
is tell you to wait a minute.

04:38.198 --> 04:39.352
Okay, relax.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.501
Now click "import video file."

04:41.516 --> 04:42.430
All right.

04:42.487 --> 04:45.313
It's telling me I have
to download RealPlayer 7.

04:45.336 --> 04:47.912
You know what?
I'll just bring it to him myself.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.031
There she is!

04:55.536 --> 04:57.881
Do you still got that bag I gave you?

04:57.895 --> 05:00.141
It's gonna be a long ride.

05:05.298 --> 05:07.750
Hold your fire.
There's no life-forms aboard.

05:07.787 --> 05:10.541
"Hold your fire"?
What, are we paying by the laser now?

05:10.556 --> 05:12.742
You don't do the budget, Terry. I do.

05:14.368 --> 05:16.401
Hey, I'm gonna do some crosswords, but...

05:16.415 --> 05:19.212
- that doesn't mean I don't want to talk.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:33.236 --> 05:35.513
My God! Look at this mess!

05:35.525 --> 05:38.041
"Hey, Darth Vader's gonna be here.
Should we maybe clean the place up?"

05:38.067 --> 05:39.673
"Nah. It's okay. He won't mind."

05:40.597 --> 05:42.903
Well, well! Princess Leia.

05:42.935 --> 05:46.540
Are you prepared to tell me what you've
done with the stolen Death Star plans?

05:46.575 --> 05:48.650
All right, Lord Vader. You win.

05:48.686 --> 05:51.882
I've hidden the plans
in one of these 26 briefcases.

05:53.448 --> 05:54.803
Ooh! Ooh! Okay, okay!

05:54.827 --> 05:57.713
Uh... uh... I'm feeling number 14!
Let's go with number 14!

06:00.576 --> 06:03.032
Oh, it's okay.
I'm just happy to be on TV.

06:03.097 --> 06:04.561
All right. Take her away.

06:09.126 --> 06:11.322
Okay, here's another one.
Who would you rather do :

06:11.355 --> 06:14.593
Jabba the Hutt right after a shower
or a service droid?

06:14.615 --> 06:17.223
My father was a service droid!

06:17.277 --> 06:18.401
Hey, where ya going?

06:18.436 --> 06:23.000
You can kiss the lower part of the back
of the canister that is my body.

06:33.428 --> 06:36.822
Oh, man! This looks like
the wrong neighborhood.

06:37.768 --> 06:38.802
Oh, boy.

06:38.858 --> 06:42.313
It's okay, R-2. Calm down. Be cool.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.212
I ain't done nothing
to antagonize nobody.

06:46.258 --> 06:49.222
What? A droid can't walk down
the desert no more?

06:49.247 --> 06:50.591
I got rights, too.

06:50.615 --> 06:51.490
Who's there?!

07:29.498 --> 07:33.443
Any attack made by the rebels against
this station would be a useless gesture

07:33.458 --> 07:35.762
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

07:35.795 --> 07:38.910
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

07:38.947 --> 07:41.293
That is fantastic. Terrific work.

07:41.308 --> 07:43.272
- So, no weaknesses at all, huh?
- Nuh...

07:43.507 --> 07:44.351
No.

07:44.596 --> 07:47.800
You, uh... you hesitated there.
Is there something I should know?

07:47.826 --> 07:51.162
No. It's virtually indestructible.
Like, 99.9%.

07:51.225 --> 07:52.621
Uh... okay.

07:52.657 --> 07:56.001
Wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't ask. What's the .01?

07:56.036 --> 07:58.481
Well, I... I mean,
there's this little hole...

07:58.515 --> 08:01.293
It was kind of an aesthetic choice
by the architect.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.552
And, if you shoot
a laser into this hole...

08:04.598 --> 08:06.392
the station blows up.

08:07.658 --> 08:09.880
That sounds like
a pretty big design flaw there.

08:09.908 --> 08:12.202
No, no, no.
The hole's only two meters across.

08:12.216 --> 08:14.320
Well, that's no bigger
than a womprat.

08:14.345 --> 08:15.410
Exactly.

08:15.438 --> 08:18.252
And even to get within range of it,
you have to skim along this whole trench.

08:18.257 --> 08:19.071
It's not a big deal.

08:19.336 --> 08:22.742
Can't we board it up? Or, you know,
put some plywood over it or something?

08:22.775 --> 08:24.020
Well, that would look terrible.

08:24.048 --> 08:25.530
I mean, we gotta think about resale.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.722
Resale? What are you talking about?

08:26.746 --> 08:29.891
This property is right above Sunset.
The value is only gonna go up.

08:29.906 --> 08:33.830
Lord Vader, your inside references
to the Los Angeles real estate market

08:33.845 --> 08:37.503
haven't given you the clairvoyance to
turn a profit on that condo in Glendale,

08:37.534 --> 08:38.592
nor has it...

08:38.626 --> 08:40.950
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

08:40.965 --> 08:43.010
That property is in a prime location.

08:43.027 --> 08:45.503
20 minutes to the beach,
20 minutes to downtown...

08:45.536 --> 08:47.980
There's nothing to do downtown.

08:48.026 --> 08:49.070
Enough of this!

08:49.107 --> 08:50.620
Vader, release him!

08:50.666 --> 08:51.952
As you wish.

08:54.016 --> 08:55.702
All right, so we gonna plug up that hole?

08:55.737 --> 08:58.602
Yeah. We can get it done tomorrow
if price is no object.

09:00.355 --> 09:02.772
- We'll get estimates.
- Get estimates. Yeah.

09:07.906 --> 09:11.023
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

09:11.058 --> 09:13.771
- Look, sir. Droids!
- Look! A penny!

09:16.567 --> 09:19.100
Hey, thanks for the sex,
early '90s printer.

09:26.457 --> 09:27.902
All right, bring 'em on out.

09:28.707 --> 09:31.603
Oh, God, it's a hundred degrees out here!

09:31.638 --> 09:35.263
If I pass out, please note
that I'm wearing a Life Call bracelet

09:35.276 --> 09:37.401
with all my insurance information.

09:38.126 --> 09:39.212
Luke?

09:39.467 --> 09:40.651
Luke!

09:41.076 --> 09:42.200
Luke!

09:42.237 --> 09:43.070
What?!

09:43.206 --> 09:47.333
Tell Uncle Owen not to tell you
that your father is Darth Vader.

09:47.386 --> 09:49.882
Aunt Beru, when are you guys
gonna let me join

09:49.897 --> 09:51.712
the rebellion like all my friends?

09:51.857 --> 09:55.430
Oh, pff! Stop whining, Luke,
and come have some blue milk.

09:55.476 --> 09:56.730
One of these days,

09:56.757 --> 10:00.870
I'm just gonna take off and join the
rebellion whether you like it or not!

10:00.908 --> 10:03.181
Over my burned carcass!

10:03.338 --> 10:05.022
Hey, shut up with-a da nois-a!

10:05.047 --> 10:06.790
Hey, shut-up-a with-a da shut-up-a!

10:06.806 --> 10:08.291
You shut-up-a with-a da shut- up-a!

10:08.326 --> 10:11.040
Shut-up-a yo face!
Now-a my dog-a won't-a shut-up-a!

10:11.044 --> 10:12.923
- Why you no-a shut up-a?
- I make-a you-a shut-up-a!

10:12.952 --> 10:15.466
- You two-a shut-up-a!
- Hey, I poke out-a my head!

10:26.505 --> 10:27.671
Someday

10:27.719 --> 10:30.833
I'll get off this rock
and fight the empire.

10:34.397 --> 10:37.952
John Williams and the
London Symphony Orchestra, everybody!

10:54.175 --> 10:56.611
Now do the theme to The People's Court.

11:12.518 --> 11:15.632
Oh, this oil bath is going
to feel so good.

11:15.788 --> 11:18.713
Hey, you guys think that '90s printer
looked clean, right?

11:18.748 --> 11:21.273
Hey, there's something stuck
in this R-2 unit.

11:22.186 --> 11:25.150
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

11:25.387 --> 11:28.492
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

11:28.636 --> 11:31.453
Whoever she is,
she sounds like she's in trouble.

11:31.477 --> 11:33.371
Is there any more to this message?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.942
Intergalactic proton-powered

11:36.965 --> 11:40.203

11:51.396 --> 11:54.060
I am currently overstocked

11:56.016 --> 11:58.362
and I am passing the savings on to you!

11:59.467 --> 12:01.263
She said, "Obi-Wan Kenobi."

12:01.288 --> 12:03.830
I wonder if she means
old Obi-Wan Kenobi.

12:04.086 --> 12:07.321
Well, I guess I'll go bull's-eye
some womprats in my T-16.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.931
My God, you shoot small animals for fun?

12:09.948 --> 12:12.550
That's the first indicator
of a serial killer, you freak.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.531
There's two suns and no women!

12:14.555 --> 12:16.603
What the hell am I supposed to do?!

12:17.605 --> 12:19.782
Master Luke, he's gone, he's gone!

12:19.798 --> 12:20.453
What?

12:20.477 --> 12:23.372
R-2, he took off in the middle
of the night! We got to find him!

12:23.405 --> 12:26.561
Oh, what the phantom menace
is that guy's problem?

12:29.015 --> 12:31.042
Hey, mind if I turn on the radio?

12:31.065 --> 12:34.521
<i>WTAT, Tatooine's all-talk radio.</i>

12:34.556 --> 12:39.042
<i>My good friends, the liberal galactic
media is at it again. They never stop.</i>

12:39.068 --> 12:41.490
<i>Now they're trying to convince us
that Hoth is melting.</i>

12:41.518 --> 12:43.400
<i>Well, that's crazy.
Just trying to scare us.</i>

12:43.435 --> 12:45.782
<i>And if that weren't enough
to get you mad,</i>

12:45.796 --> 12:49.823
<i>we now have news that Lando Calrissian
has been made the chief administrator</i>

12:49.838 --> 12:52.122
<i>of the Bespin Mining Facility.</i>

12:52.147 --> 12:53.913
<i>Gee, I wonder how he got that job.</i>

12:53.918 --> 12:55.772
<i>Well, let me tell you
how he got that job.</i>

12:55.796 --> 12:58.100
<i>Affirmative action strikes again.</i>

12:58.125 --> 12:59.400
<i>The time is 8:50.</i>

13:01.968 --> 13:05.332
- R-2, what are you doing out here?
- Beep-boop-beep.

13:05.347 --> 13:08.413
He says, "There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast."

13:08.446 --> 13:09.842
That's not what I said.

13:09.855 --> 13:12.921
I said there ain't a pack
of menthols on this planet.

13:14.457 --> 13:17.643
Well, I see some Bantha tracks,
but I don't see any...

13:17.767 --> 13:21.543
Wait a minute. There's Sand People,
all right. I can see one of them now.

13:39.278 --> 13:40.882
Who the hell are you?

13:42.926 --> 13:45.812
One lucky sumbitch.

13:48.688 --> 13:52.470
So, Luke, what brings
your muscley arms out this way?

13:52.485 --> 13:54.181
I'll show you, Mr. Obi-Wan.

13:54.197 --> 13:56.090
R-2, play him the message.

13:57.207 --> 14:01.892
General Kenobi, many years ago,
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

14:01.956 --> 14:03.802
We need your help again.

14:03.847 --> 14:06.053
And not to get too personal, but...

14:06.077 --> 14:09.282
you owe us after that mess
you got into back on Alderaan.

14:10.496 --> 14:14.251
...and we pay to keep the families
of those children quiet, so...

14:14.286 --> 14:17.103
Oh, this is just...
just like logistical stuff.

14:17.127 --> 14:18.513
I'll check that later.

14:18.528 --> 14:20.290
...Joey Lawrence haircut,

14:20.318 --> 14:22.602
so I'll assume we can count on your help

14:22.638 --> 14:25.842
to get the Death Star plans
to my father on Alderaan.

14:25.956 --> 14:28.943
The plans are stored inside this R-2 unit.

14:29.177 --> 14:32.011
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

14:32.396 --> 14:34.352
All right now, what do I click?

14:34.866 --> 14:39.581
Luke, you must learn the ways of
the Force and come with meto Alderaan.

14:39.616 --> 14:41.062
What's the Force?

14:41.087 --> 14:44.333
The Force is what gives
a Jedi knight his power.

14:44.575 --> 14:47.693
It surrounds us. It penetrates us.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.480
Here, check this out.

14:52.296 --> 14:54.350
Wow! This is cool!

14:54.377 --> 14:56.881
Yeah, everyone in
the neighborhood has one.

15:01.355 --> 15:05.121
Hey, why would you hang that up?
It looks so tantalizing.

15:07.435 --> 15:10.762
You know, the Empire's gonna come
looking for these droids.

15:10.795 --> 15:14.561
But if they find out who the Jewas sold
them to, that could lead them back...

15:14.857 --> 15:16.013
home.

15:16.047 --> 15:18.843
Luke, wait! It's too dangerous!

15:18.975 --> 15:22.121
Get your fat space ass back here.

15:32.857 --> 15:34.262
Uncle Owen?

15:34.636 --> 15:36.252
Aunt Beru?

15:37.466 --> 15:39.070
Oh, my God!

15:41.937 --> 15:43.863
John Williams!

15:46.207 --> 15:49.963
Great, now we got to do the rest
of this thing with Danny Elfman.

16:11.598 --> 16:13.930
Mos Eisley Space Port.

16:13.988 --> 16:18.010
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

16:18.066 --> 16:20.761
My sister Regina D2 lives here.

16:20.797 --> 16:23.192
- Is she single?
- She's a lezbot.

16:39.336 --> 16:41.893
- He doesn't like you.
- Sorry.

16:42.596 --> 16:46.232
- I don't like you either.
- You don't even know me.

16:46.265 --> 16:48.013
You know what? That's fair.

16:48.055 --> 16:50.843
I'm Pignose and this is
my brother-in-law Scott.

16:50.868 --> 16:53.993
- He's visiting from Hoth.
- I don't know why they call it Hoth.

16:54.005 --> 16:56.573
- They should call it "Coldth."
- Okay, settle down.

16:56.607 --> 16:58.063
I'm up after the band.

16:58.235 --> 17:01.920
Thank you. We're the Cantina Band.
If you have any requests, shout them out.

17:01.977 --> 17:05.800
<i>Play that same song.</i>
All right, same song. Here we go.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.551
Hi. My sexy friend and I

17:11.575 --> 17:14.151
are looking for a ship
to take us to Alderaan,

17:14.194 --> 17:16.593
and I'm willing to pay big money.

17:16.656 --> 17:18.640
Well, you've come to the right place.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.210
I'm Han Solo, captain
of the Millennium Falcon

17:21.224 --> 17:24.442
and the only actor whose career
isn't destroyed by this movie.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.690
- Is it a fast ship?
- Are you kidding?

17:26.728 --> 17:29.711
It's the ship that made the Kessel Run
in less than 12 parsecs.

17:29.787 --> 17:30.561
Um...

17:30.595 --> 17:33.491
Isn't a parsec a unit of distance,
not time?

17:33.508 --> 17:34.642
No, no, no, no.

17:34.775 --> 17:37.213
Chewie, take these guys
to the ship and get her ready.

17:40.438 --> 17:43.831
Always gargle before a takeoff.
Waka-waka. All right, let's go.

17:49.278 --> 17:53.182
Greedo, as a matter of fact, I was
just going to see Jaba and tell him...

18:18.756 --> 18:21.810
- Well, what do you think?
- What a piece of junk.

18:21.887 --> 18:25.501
Thank you. This was my brother's. He
died of leukemia. How do you feel now?

18:25.518 --> 18:27.860
You got any strawberry milkin there?

18:27.876 --> 18:30.153
No, but she'll make .5 past lightspeed.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.481
If you want, I'll show you around

18:31.508 --> 18:33.903
since no one's trying
to stop the ship or blast us.

18:33.936 --> 18:35.593
Stop that ship! Blast them!

18:36.088 --> 18:38.670
Oh, now I can't show you around.
Quick, get in the ship.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.240
Looks like we got
Imperial cruisers on our tail.

18:57.318 --> 19:01.803
Oh, look at that one on the left.
Get off your cell phone. You are driving.

19:10.007 --> 19:11.763
They're gaining on us!

19:11.775 --> 19:14.211
We'll be safe enough once
we make the jump to hyperspace.

19:14.226 --> 19:16.553
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose them.

19:21.938 --> 19:24.631
Uh, that, thatwas your maneuver,

19:24.666 --> 19:26.543
moving slightly to the left?

19:26.575 --> 19:29.263
Well, I mean, we're not in
the same place we were, huh?

19:29.306 --> 19:32.780
- That ought to confuse them.
- Yeah, but you hardly did anything.

19:32.826 --> 19:35.951
You just started listinglazily
to the left.

19:35.987 --> 19:37.651
I'm pretty sure they can keep up.

19:37.688 --> 19:39.093
- Where did they go?!
- There they are.

19:39.127 --> 19:41.541
They're listinglazily to the left.
Go left! Left!

19:41.568 --> 19:43.542
Boy, this guy knows some maneuvers.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.320
All right, strap yourselves in.
I'm about to make the jump to lightspeed.

19:46.356 --> 19:49.041
Did he say "strap in" or "strap on"?

19:55.635 --> 19:58.313
Man, hyperspace always looks so freaky.

20:19.596 --> 20:20.960
Governor Tarkin,

20:20.986 --> 20:24.252
I recognized your foul stench
as soon as I was brought on board.

20:24.288 --> 20:26.232
Um, actually, that's me.

20:26.258 --> 20:27.912
I made a Darth doody.

20:27.998 --> 20:32.681
Princess Leia, we've chosen to test
our Death Star planet blower-upper gun

20:32.706 --> 20:35.122
on your home planet of Alderaan.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.083
No!

20:36.387 --> 20:38.793
She said, "No."
Should we still do it?

20:39.608 --> 20:40.341
Yeah.

20:55.845 --> 20:58.170
So anyway, I says,
"Forget the dental plan."

20:58.196 --> 21:01.222
"Forget sick leave.
I just want a railing," you know?

21:01.246 --> 21:02.653
"One railing right here."

21:02.677 --> 21:05.660
Yeah, I know. I've almost
fallen over that thing so many times.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.562
- So what did they say?
- Oh, get this.

21:07.578 --> 21:10.060
They said they're worried
we'd be leaning all day.

21:10.107 --> 21:11.773
- They said that?
- Yeah.

21:12.346 --> 21:15.002
Well, none of this will matter
when we're famous singers.

21:21.608 --> 21:24.441
- How am I doing?
- Just keep your knees bent.

21:24.486 --> 21:28.212
Imagine you're spreading butter
on a big piece of bread.

21:28.265 --> 21:30.923
That's it.
Spread that butter...

21:30.968 --> 21:32.452
with the Force.

21:32.496 --> 21:35.493
Ha! You guys seem like
crazy morons to me.

21:35.947 --> 21:38.080
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

21:38.106 --> 21:40.173
Oh, you mean that thing
you just found out about, like,

21:40.197 --> 21:42.981
three hours ago and are now
judging me for not believing in it?

21:43.007 --> 21:44.532
Do you believe in anything?

21:44.565 --> 21:46.930
Uh, yeah. Didn't you see
my Kabbalah bracelet?

21:46.958 --> 21:49.102
- What's Kabbalah?
- About a buck seventy-five.

21:50.106 --> 21:52.902
Honestly, I have no idea.
I'm just a slave to trends.

21:55.978 --> 21:57.012
What the hell?

21:57.078 --> 22:00.422
Oh, my God, we came out of hyperspace
into an asteroid field.

22:06.278 --> 22:08.843
Alderaan's been destroyed by the Empire.

22:08.876 --> 22:10.720
Maybe we should head for that small moon

22:10.735 --> 22:13.463
that's clearly a small moon
and not anything else.

22:16.565 --> 22:18.112
That's no moon.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.151
It's a space station.

22:22.898 --> 22:25.140
Oh, crap, that got us in a tractor beam.

22:25.188 --> 22:27.251
Well, they're not gonna get me
without a fight.

22:29.658 --> 22:31.022
You can't win.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.563
But there are alternatives to fighting.

22:33.576 --> 22:34.453
Like what?

22:34.478 --> 22:37.012
Like getting the hell out of here!

22:38.627 --> 22:41.683
No, just kidding.
Can you imagine if I was like that?

23:22.238 --> 23:25.172
All right, just follow my lead
and act real cool.

23:47.308 --> 23:50.041
All right, I'm gonna go knock out
that tractor beam.

23:50.058 --> 23:52.041
And we'll go rescue the princess.

23:52.098 --> 23:55.830
You know Luke, this may be the last time
we see each other.

23:55.856 --> 23:58.171
So there's something I want you to know.

23:58.408 --> 24:00.140
<i>Now I've</i>

24:00.928 --> 24:04.460
<i>had the time of my life</i>

24:04.568 --> 24:08.853
<i>And I owe it all to you...</i>

24:11.416 --> 24:13.480
<i>I've been waiting for so long</i>

24:13.526 --> 24:17.662
<i>Now I've finally found someone
to stand by me</i>

24:20.256 --> 24:22.640
<i>So we take each other's hand</i>

24:22.695 --> 24:27.420
<i>Cause we seem to understand the urgency</i>

24:27.897 --> 24:29.923
<i>Just remember</i>

24:30.605 --> 24:33.701
<i>You're the one thing</i>

24:34.025 --> 24:37.842
<i>I can't get enough of</i>

24:39.066 --> 24:42.603
<i>So I'll tell you something</i>

24:44.075 --> 24:47.853
<i>This could be love
Because</i>

24:48.236 --> 24:53.092
<i>I've had the time of my life</i>

24:53.147 --> 24:57.543
<i>No I never felt this way before</i>

24:57.626 --> 25:02.130
<i>Yes, I swear, it's the truth</i>

25:02.188 --> 25:06.491
<i>And I owe it all to you...</i>

25:15.047 --> 25:16.621
Holly smoke!

25:21.827 --> 25:23.380
So, whate **** we are
on the first floor?

25:23.415 --> 25:25.053
Uh, we are on the second floor.

25:25.075 --> 25:27.860
No, no, no, **** here's the
Banana republic and we just pass that.

25:27.898 --> 25:28.631
Uh...

25:28.878 --> 25:30.650
... it's right back there.
We, we, uh...

25:30.705 --> 25:32.370
we park on Macy's side, ****

25:32.386 --> 25:34.851
So now we must be other here
by the JCPenney.

25:34.878 --> 25:37.513
It looks that the first floor
is mostly main stuff, ****

25:37.606 --> 25:39.561
and there's a lady Foot Locker
right other there. ****

25:39.568 --> 25:41.111
All right, so we are on the third floor.

25:41.137 --> 25:42.420
All right, let's get in the elevator.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.510
And hurry up, 'cause the smell of
that Mrs. Fields is killing me.

26:01.637 --> 26:04.043
Where are you taking this... thing?

26:04.088 --> 26:06.620
Prisoner transfer from cell block 1138.

26:06.638 --> 26:08.671
You think you could get me
a room by the pool?

26:09.718 --> 26:12.203
Is funny because you are prisoner.

26:12.236 --> 26:15.142
And there is no pool
because is Death Star.

26:17.475 --> 26:20.251
We got to find out what cell
this princess of yours is in.

26:20.265 --> 26:22.613
- There it is, 2187.
- I'm on it.

26:22.696 --> 26:25.890
Uh, everything's under control here.
Situation normal.

26:25.906 --> 26:26.842
<i>What happened?</i>

26:26.868 --> 26:29.503
We, uh, had a slight weapons
malfunction, but

26:29.518 --> 26:31.483
everything's perfectly all right.
We're fine.

26:31.526 --> 26:33.961
We're all fine... here... now...

26:34.086 --> 26:35.050
thank you.

26:35.425 --> 26:36.423
How are you?

26:36.555 --> 26:38.750
<i>Uh... I've been better.</i>

26:38.796 --> 26:40.602
- Well, tell me what's up.
<i>- Well,</i>

26:40.625 --> 26:43.863
<i>I'm in this relationship and
it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.</i>

26:43.897 --> 26:46.653
<i>I like her, but...
we're not really connecting.</i>

26:46.665 --> 26:48.673
- How long's it been?
<i>- About ten months.</i>

26:48.708 --> 26:51.120
- And how often do you see each other?
<i>- Couple of times a week.</i>

26:51.146 --> 26:53.630
Well, why don't you try seeing
each other a little more often

26:53.647 --> 26:55.210
and see if you connect a little more.

26:55.228 --> 26:57.253
And if not, it may be time to move on.

26:57.277 --> 26:58.221
Thanks for calling.

26:58.237 --> 26:59.373
This is Han Solo,

26:59.386 --> 27:01.660
and I'm going to be keeping you
company for the next few hours,

27:01.687 --> 27:03.610
right here on the midnight shift.

27:03.647 --> 27:07.903
<i>Something's telling me it might be you...</i>

27:09.236 --> 27:13.032
<i>It's telling me it might be you...</i>

27:15.207 --> 27:17.682
Aren't you a little fat
to be a storm trooper?

27:17.706 --> 27:20.012
Well, stay here and rot,
you stuck-up bitch.

27:20.048 --> 27:21.571
Wait. Who are you?

27:21.588 --> 27:22.903
I'm Luke Skywalker.

27:22.927 --> 27:25.493
Me and Han Solo and Obi-Wan
are here to rescue you.

27:25.508 --> 27:28.060
- Wait, Obi-Wan Kenobi?
- Yeah.

27:28.096 --> 27:30.303
Suddenly I'm not so fat, huh?

27:40.325 --> 27:42.440
Come on, into the garbage chute.

27:44.707 --> 27:46.650
She's right. Come on, Chewbacca.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.540
Are you kidding? It's probably full
of disease. I'm not jumping in there.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.692
Not even if I throw this pig's ear?

27:51.716 --> 27:53.910
- Oh, come on, that's not fair.
- Go get it!

27:57.227 --> 28:00.483
Oh, boy, great idea, Princess,
diving into a pile of garbage.

28:00.496 --> 28:02.480
When we get out of here,
maybe you can show me around

28:02.495 --> 28:03.800
your home planet of Alderaan.

28:03.825 --> 28:05.050
Aw...!

28:05.097 --> 28:06.231
Too soon?

28:06.256 --> 28:07.780
Hey, it could be worse.

28:09.417 --> 28:10.571
It's worse.

28:13.805 --> 28:15.921
The walls are closing!

28:19.538 --> 28:22.212
Listen to them, R-2. They're dying.
What do we do?

28:22.247 --> 28:24.530
Only one thing to do, man.

28:24.556 --> 28:26.821
You still got that bag I gave you?

28:30.878 --> 28:35.680
Man, I wish I could listen to some
Tattooine, Wind and Fire right now.

28:35.845 --> 28:36.743
Mm...

28:36.777 --> 28:39.643
So you think
the Empire's gonna fall, man?

28:39.758 --> 28:41.632
I-I-I don't...I don't know, man.

28:42.485 --> 28:45.293
H-How you, how you, how you,
how you doing right now?

28:45.325 --> 28:46.793
Good. Why?

28:46.885 --> 28:47.551
I think,

28:47.596 --> 28:51.052
I think, I think I... I think I may be
having sort of... a mini freak-out here.

28:51.078 --> 28:52.560
- Oh.
- Just-Just...

28:52.875 --> 28:54.990
Just tell me I don't have
to stay in this room.

28:55.006 --> 28:55.642
What?

28:55.665 --> 28:58.491
Just tell me right now that I...
that I don't have to stay in this room.

28:58.507 --> 29:00.600
You don't have to stay in this room.

29:00.615 --> 29:01.782
Oh, thank God.

29:07.796 --> 29:09.673
Thank God we're saved.

29:10.448 --> 29:13.630
Look at this.
Who throws out half a pizza?

29:13.646 --> 29:15.031
And look at this couch.

29:15.055 --> 29:18.243
Somebody threw out a whole couch
and it's in great shape.

29:18.256 --> 29:19.972
Yeah, you put a little Febreze on that,

29:19.986 --> 29:22.263
scrub it out a little bit,
it'll look great in your apartment.

29:22.287 --> 29:23.131
You know what?

29:23.156 --> 29:26.020
I know we have a dangerous job
to do here, but

29:26.048 --> 29:27.220
I'm taking this.

29:27.247 --> 29:28.672
I'm taking this couch.

29:28.988 --> 29:30.120
All right, you ready?

29:30.158 --> 29:32.760
All right, one... two... three.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.420
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Okay.

29:36.668 --> 29:38.580
- Stop, stop, stop, stop...
- What? What...?

29:39.016 --> 29:40.802
- No, no, no, no... Twist it.
- I am.

29:41.925 --> 29:44.170
No, no, no, no, no, other way.
You're twisting the wrong way.

29:44.178 --> 29:46.163
- What do you want me to do?
- Just look down, all right.

29:46.175 --> 29:47.883
Just look at me, look what I'm doing.

29:47.898 --> 29:49.192
- You see the way I'm twisting it?
- Yeah.

29:49.218 --> 29:51.193
- Turn it that way from your end.
- Okay.

29:51.828 --> 29:52.851
No, no, no, no, no.

29:54.537 --> 29:56.320
Put it down. Put it down. Just drop it.

29:56.346 --> 29:57.430
All right. All right.

29:57.457 --> 29:58.301
All right, let's...

29:58.865 --> 30:00.570
Just hang on and figure this out.

30:00.598 --> 30:02.931
Han, there are storm troopers
all over the place.

30:02.946 --> 30:04.532
Shouldn't we be getting out of here?

30:04.876 --> 30:06.480
All right, okay, all right, okay.

30:06.508 --> 30:07.992
I got it, I know... okay, okay...

30:08.515 --> 30:10.740
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna take the cushions off,

30:10.755 --> 30:12.083
unscrew the legs,

30:12.115 --> 30:15.110
take the mattress out and this
whole thing is gonna be a lot simpler.

30:15.136 --> 30:16.961
It's easier than we're making it.

30:38.365 --> 30:39.891
Hey, did you hear something?

30:39.918 --> 30:42.252
Probably just another drill.

30:42.297 --> 30:44.591
You know that last drill we had?

30:44.626 --> 30:47.550
I was about to finally
bone my girlfriend,

30:47.567 --> 30:50.171
and then we heard
that there was this drill

30:50.198 --> 30:52.863
and she told me there was no way.

30:58.795 --> 31:00.463
So, Obi-Wan...

31:00.637 --> 31:02.042
we meet again.

31:02.216 --> 31:06.510
What part of "stay 50 yards away
at all times" don't you understand?

31:08.848 --> 31:10.012
Uh-oh.

31:10.065 --> 31:12.513
Your powers are weak, old man.

31:15.465 --> 31:16.813
Obi-Wan!

31:18.485 --> 31:20.793
Boy, you got here just in time.

31:22.468 --> 31:23.810
No...!

31:32.716 --> 31:35.112
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

31:38.127 --> 31:39.621
All right, twist it counter-clockwise.

31:39.627 --> 31:41.353
I am twisting it.
You're twisting it the other way.

31:41.355 --> 31:43.531
I mean counter-clockwise
from where I'm standing

31:43.557 --> 31:44.912
so... so th... so then you...

31:44.926 --> 31:45.853
so clockwise.

31:46.826 --> 31:48.322
You twist it clockwise.

31:48.528 --> 31:49.690
Okay... okay, go.

31:50.335 --> 31:52.320
You know what? Put it down,
put it down for a second.

31:52.338 --> 31:54.562
- My fingers are killing me.
- Han, they're shooting at us!

31:54.595 --> 31:56.342
You know what? Lift it up tall ways.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.710
Aw, for cr...
oh, it's wedged. It's wedged.

32:01.137 --> 32:03.421
You know what? It's not going anywhere.
Let's just take off,

32:03.438 --> 32:04.460
we'll deal with it later.

32:04.477 --> 32:06.350
You get in the cockpit and I'll just...

32:06.376 --> 32:08.110
I'll hang on to this thing as we go.

32:19.688 --> 32:20.962
Easy.

32:33.155 --> 32:35.320
I can't believe he's gone.

32:35.357 --> 32:37.463
I know, Luke, but it's true.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.621
He's gone.

32:38.776 --> 32:41.091
I mean, you saw him get beheaded.

32:41.116 --> 32:44.502
Nobody lives through that...
Not for long, anyway.

32:44.515 --> 32:47.561
I mean, sometimes the brain
is still active for a few minutes

32:47.567 --> 32:49.181
after the beheading, but...

32:49.216 --> 32:52.341
to be honest, I can't imagine
a worse kind of hell.

32:52.355 --> 32:53.751
And unfortunately,

32:53.768 --> 32:55.840
hell is probably where he'll end up,

32:55.867 --> 32:59.453
because the Christians don't look
too kindly on the whole Force thing.

32:59.515 --> 33:01.670
Come on, kid,
we're not out of the woods yet.

33:05.516 --> 33:06.812
Here they come!

33:23.526 --> 33:25.023
- Hey, Han!
- What?!

33:25.038 --> 33:27.971
- Why do they call them "Tie Fighters"?
- - No idea!

33:40.406 --> 33:42.161
They're coming too fast!

33:42.188 --> 33:44.172
Oh, boy. Nickel for every time
that's happened.

33:44.186 --> 33:45.422
Just keep shooting, Luke!

33:53.946 --> 33:56.441
That's how we do it
in my neighborhood, bitch!

34:00.748 --> 34:02.640
I got him! I got him!

34:02.656 --> 34:04.471
Great, kid! Don't get penis-y!

34:09.878 --> 34:11.300
I just want to tell you both...

34:11.346 --> 34:13.371
Good luck.
We're all counting on you.

34:39.846 --> 34:40.791
Mom?

34:40.996 --> 34:42.331
Yeah. Yeah we won.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.060
Yeah, we won the battle.

34:44.906 --> 34:46.650
Yeah, I'm calling like you asked.

34:46.887 --> 34:47.701
Okay.

34:47.885 --> 34:48.583
Okay.

34:48.828 --> 34:50.433
Okay, but...
okay, but I gotta go...

34:50.797 --> 34:52.112
I got other stuff to do.

34:52.476 --> 34:53.310
O-Okay

34:53.456 --> 34:54.949
Okay, okay, but I gotta go.

34:55.585 --> 34:56.351
Okay.

34:56.695 --> 34:57.991
Okay, yes.

34:58.438 --> 34:59.263
Yes.

34:59.787 --> 35:01.182
Yes, yes, Mom.

35:01.207 --> 35:03.483
I-I love you too, Mom.
Okay, all right, good-bye.

35:26.996 --> 35:28.510
P-choo. P-choo.

35:28.537 --> 35:29.743
Gotcha.

35:32.456 --> 35:36.261
Thanks to the information in this
R-2 unit provided by Princess Leia,

35:36.305 --> 35:39.781
we should be able to mount a
successful offensive on the Death Star.

35:39.805 --> 35:40.660
But first,

35:40.676 --> 35:43.493
please take a moment to watch
this instructional video.

35:48.965 --> 35:50.531
Nothing but net.

35:50.688 --> 35:51.422
Hi,

35:51.447 --> 35:55.813
I'm Magic Johnson with a few tips
on blowing up the Death Star.

35:55.997 --> 35:59.171
First off, never forget your objective.

35:59.206 --> 36:03.180
There gonna be so many folks
coming at you to slow you down,

36:03.225 --> 36:06.823
you might feel like you got
a bull's-eye on your head.

36:07.025 --> 36:09.942
No, but they will be trying to kill you.

36:10.238 --> 36:14.322
Also, don't forget you have teammates
out there watching your back.

36:14.378 --> 36:18.381
Unless you been messing around
with their wife or girlfriend.

36:18.546 --> 36:21.380
No, but they will be there to help you.

36:21.646 --> 36:22.733
Lastly,

36:22.767 --> 36:26.931
you wanna make sure you step back and
take cover after you sink that bucket,

36:26.957 --> 36:30.703
'cause that sky gonna light up
like the Fourth of July.

36:31.025 --> 36:34.800
No, but there will be a large explosion.

36:46.096 --> 36:48.322
Well, kid, I guess this is good-bye.

36:48.335 --> 36:51.140
So, you got your reward
and you're leaving. Is that it?

36:51.155 --> 36:52.972
When you say it that way,
I sound like a douche,

36:52.987 --> 36:54.123
but, yeah, that's what I'm doing.

36:54.135 --> 36:56.161
What'd you get for a reward anyway?

36:56.387 --> 36:59.620
Uh, let's see,
I got 10% off a Netflix membership,

36:59.715 --> 37:00.761
uh...

37:00.828 --> 37:02.923
some nice Cracker Barrel Cheddar,

37:03.287 --> 37:08.340
assorted lotions, and a little plastic
champagne bottle full of jelly beans...

37:08.395 --> 37:10.002
and a little bear.

37:10.206 --> 37:11.882
See? Little bear?

37:12.166 --> 37:15.022
"Hey, Luke. We had fun
on the Death Star."

37:15.046 --> 37:16.941
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

37:16.957 --> 37:18.971
I guess that's what you're best at.

37:19.335 --> 37:21.760
Oh, look, a light saber cheese knife.

37:26.016 --> 37:26.962
Yuck.

37:41.487 --> 37:42.741
All wings. Check in.

37:42.758 --> 37:45.353
- Red three standing by.
- Red six standing by.

37:45.365 --> 37:48.123
- Red five standing by.
- Red Buttons standing by.

37:48.147 --> 37:50.620
- Redd Foxx standin' by!
- Big Red standing by.

37:50.645 --> 37:53.823
<i>- Red October standing by.</i>
- Helen Reddy standing by.

37:53.835 --> 37:55.651
Simply Red standing by.

38:25.777 --> 38:28.211
I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins!

38:28.278 --> 38:30.512
Uh, having a little trouble here.

38:42.095 --> 38:45.193
Careful, Redd Foxx,
there's one right on your tail!

38:49.826 --> 38:52.062
Ahh! I'm comin', Elizabeth!

39:00.666 --> 39:02.792
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

39:02.825 --> 39:05.581
- Obi-Wan?
<i>- Yeah, it's me.</i>

39:05.705 --> 39:07.733
<i>Use the Force.</i>

39:07.755 --> 39:09.391
<i>Force that thing in there.</i>

39:09.405 --> 39:11.540
<i>Just like I showed you
with those puppets.</i>

39:11.556 --> 39:14.480
<i>but don't tell anybody
 'cause you'll get in trouble.</i>

39:22.416 --> 39:25.033
Clark, I don't like the look
of this neighborhood.

39:25.045 --> 39:26.713
Come on, Ellen,
it's important for the kids

39:26.726 --> 39:28.370
to witness the plight of the rebellion.

39:28.395 --> 39:30.133
Kids, you noticing all this plight?

39:30.977 --> 39:32.001
Roll 'em up!

39:38.277 --> 39:40.332
The Force is strong with this one.

39:44.487 --> 39:46.571
**** you, you son of a bitch!

39:46.598 --> 39:48.400
What am I, R2-Pac?!

39:48.428 --> 39:50.501
<i>The Death Star is getting closer.</i>

39:50.578 --> 39:53.281
And Leia's getting larger!

40:04.846 --> 40:07.120
I have you now, young Skywalker!

40:07.158 --> 40:10.401
And with today's gas prices,
not a minute too soon.

40:12.605 --> 40:13.533
What the deuce?!

40:16.076 --> 40:16.910
Look at this.

40:16.925 --> 40:19.541
Look how much more comfortable
we are now shooting stuff.

40:47.426 --> 40:51.521
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you always.</i>

40:51.966 --> 40:53.510
<i>And so will I.</i>

40:53.525 --> 40:54.993
<i>Always.</i>

40:55.025 --> 40:58.261
<i>'Course, when you get older
and get some crow's feet,</i>

40:58.295 --> 41:00.303
<i>I might lose interest.</i>

41:09.296 --> 41:10.752
The end.

41:13.705 --> 41:14.681
Well, Dad,

41:14.698 --> 41:16.323
thanks for keeping us entertained.

41:16.335 --> 41:17.992
That was a great story.

41:18.008 --> 41:19.242
Yeah, but

41:19.268 --> 41:22.493
didn't Robot Chicken already
do this three months ago?

41:22.525 --> 41:24.031
Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Chris.

41:24.055 --> 41:26.822
I don't think people are even aware
of that show's existence.

41:26.857 --> 41:29.701
Well, I don't know, Dad. I think
a decent number of people watch it.

41:29.736 --> 41:31.061
Oh really? Define "decent."

41:31.078 --> 41:33.670
I think it's the highest-rated show
on Cartoon Network

41:33.708 --> 41:36.072
and the Star Wars episode
doubled that audience.

41:36.096 --> 41:38.900
Well, yeah, but double ten people
is like 20 people,

41:38.917 --> 41:41.283
so, I mean, what kind of numbers
are we talking about here, you know?

41:41.296 --> 41:42.791
Don't be glib about this stuff, Dad.

41:42.807 --> 41:45.492
It's a legitimate show
and they beat you to the punch.

41:45.566 --> 41:47.352
Uh... I don't know about that, Chris.

41:47.365 --> 41:51.212
I mean, to me, a legitimate show
is on ABC, CBS, NBC...

41:51.227 --> 41:52.942
You know, one of the real networks.

41:53.338 --> 41:54.950
I don't know about that, Dad.

41:54.968 --> 41:57.420
And besides, what's up
with that 15-minute runtime?

41:57.436 --> 42:01.040
What is that? It's like 15 minutes
of guys playing with Star Wars dolls?

42:01.056 --> 42:04.340
- Oh, yay, yay, tune me into that.
- Oh, so you do know the show.

42:04.356 --> 42:07.341
I read part of a review online.
I am not a fan.

42:07.847 --> 42:10.193
You know, Dad, you're a real jerk!
