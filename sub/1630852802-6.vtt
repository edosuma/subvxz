WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.202
[screams]

00:03.204 --> 00:04.269
- The sand's hot?
- It's hot!

00:04.271 --> 00:06.038
- Are you dying?
- Oh, my God.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.906
- Are your feet on fire?
- My feet are on fire!

00:07.908 --> 00:09.308
[laughs] It's good exercise.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.277
I actually see some similarities

00:12.279 --> 00:14.146
between Georgi
and your ex-husband.

00:14.148 --> 00:18.984
My ex-husband lacked the
motivation, financially, to get ahead.

00:18.986 --> 00:22.588
Do you think that what didn't
work out in your first marriage

00:22.590 --> 00:25.657
is maybe, like,
a trigger for you?

00:25.659 --> 00:28.394
You see us getting
married here, by the ocean?

00:33.768 --> 00:36.368
It be a great transition
for us to move here.

00:40.941 --> 00:43.342
Some [bleep] I've been hearing
about you, bro, is not really cool.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.778
Money in the socks,
credit card debt...

00:45.780 --> 00:47.212
[Georgi speaking]

00:47.214 --> 00:49.715
Back the [bleep] off, bro.
Now you're getting out of line.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.250
[Georgi speaking]

01:00.895 --> 01:03.796
I'm sorry for
not having your back.

01:03.798 --> 01:08.000
But sometimes I feel like if I fall or
lean back, are you gonna catch me?

01:09.870 --> 01:11.303
You gonna catch me?

01:15.209 --> 01:16.809
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:16.811 --> 01:19.611
Welcome to the House of Eleven
casting call.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.214
<i>[Darcey] This fashion show
is a huge deal.</i>

01:22.216 --> 01:24.616
<i>I'm starting to feel nervous
about what's to come.</i>

01:24.618 --> 01:25.984
You guys can go in there
and get changed

01:25.986 --> 01:27.986
and we'll keep
in contact with you.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.956
If our show fails,
that can ruin our company.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.226
[theme music]

01:56.250 --> 01:58.784
- Okay, we're here.
- So excited.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.019
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.355
Oh, yeah. Catch me.
Catch me if I fall.

02:03.757 --> 02:06.358
Thank you. Okay

02:06.360 --> 02:08.227
[Aniko] It's like a clown car.

02:08.863 --> 02:10.262
All right, ready? Let's go.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.930
We've been in Miami
for a few days now

02:11.932 --> 02:14.967
and we are gearing up
for our fashion show tomorrow,

02:14.969 --> 02:16.201
because we're ready to...

02:16.203 --> 02:19.304
[together] ...debut our new
swimwear line!

02:19.306 --> 02:21.173
A new swimwear men's line.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.142
Yes, for House of Eleven.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.844
[Darcey] You guys ready
to meet the team?

02:25.846 --> 02:27.379
[Aspen] I'm so excited.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.014
[everyone] Hey!

02:29.016 --> 02:31.450
- Cherry!
- Hi, guys!

02:31.452 --> 02:32.851
- Hi, guys!
- Oh, my God!

02:32.853 --> 02:34.552
- It's been forever.
- Hey, Cherry.

02:34.554 --> 02:37.789
<i>[Darcey] We're so excited that the
team is finally here, they arrived from LA.</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:39.791
<i>And there's still so much to do.</i>

02:39.793 --> 02:43.896
Definitely have to organize all the
clothes and the looks for the models.

02:43.898 --> 02:48.167
And actually, we still have to get Aniko
and Aspen and Georgi and Florian...

02:48.169 --> 02:50.269
Fitted for the clothes they're
wearing for the runway show.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.475
Florian.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.280
Cherrie and Conrad,
the dream team

03:01.282 --> 03:02.748
<i>Cherry is the best.</i>

03:02.750 --> 03:04.716
<i>She knows the business
inside and out,</i>

03:04.718 --> 03:05.984
so she runs
the day-to-day operations.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.687
And Conrad, he helps
with the designs.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.856
With, you know, the
pattern makers, the sewers...

03:10.858 --> 03:15.427
It's our vision, and they
implement the vision to fruition.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.269
Oh, Darcey,
you know, you gotta...

03:24.271 --> 03:25.470
[Darcey] I am tiny.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.975
Let me see. It's fine.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.343
Let me see. Baby.

03:45.159 --> 03:48.160
[Darcey] How about this one?
How about this one?

03:49.997 --> 03:52.331
That one looks I guess a
little bit more stretched, though.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.099
[Conrad speaking]

04:02.009 --> 04:03.442
[Cherry speaking]

04:12.019 --> 04:13.919
[Darcey] Okay.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.153
[Conrad speaking]

04:15.155 --> 04:17.055
Can we alter it real quick?

04:17.057 --> 04:18.357
[Georgi] No, this part is small.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.026
[Florian] Try again.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.461
[Conrad speaking]

04:23.597 --> 04:25.197
[Georgi speaking]

04:25.199 --> 04:27.466
- That's not a look...
- And tuck, suck and tuck!

04:28.068 --> 04:30.335
Georgi is usually a medium size,

04:30.337 --> 04:32.137
so I don't know
why he can't fit in it.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.312
[whispering] Okay. Well...

04:45.419 --> 04:46.818
[Conrad speaking]

04:46.820 --> 04:47.786
He can't wear this.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.054
[Conrad speaking]

04:49.590 --> 04:51.923
I hope there's no other issues

04:51.925 --> 04:55.027
because we're cutting it
short on time.

04:55.029 --> 04:58.363
<i>[Darcey] I'm really concerned,
because we need Georgi in the show.</i>

04:58.365 --> 05:00.599
We have 20 looks
for our fashion show

05:00.601 --> 05:03.101
<i>and if he can't fit
into anything that we brought,</i>

05:03.103 --> 05:04.770
he's not gonna be able
to walk in the show

05:04.772 --> 05:08.073
and we're gonna be,
like, out a model.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.309
This is the Aniko look,
look at it!

05:10.311 --> 05:13.345
The black and white with
the little ruffled sleeves.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.780
Here, go ahead and try that on.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.415
Aspen...

05:16.417 --> 05:18.283
- you got this amazing...
- I like the bright colors.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.118
So colorful!

05:20.120 --> 05:21.486
- I love it!
- Yes. Yay!

05:21.922 --> 05:23.955
Here, you guys change.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.593
I feel pretty confident
walking on that runway

05:28.595 --> 05:30.495
'cause I do have
my pageant experience.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.031
Oh, wow!

05:33.033 --> 05:35.867
- Yes!
- You guys look so beautiful!

05:35.869 --> 05:37.068
Very angelic.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.037
<i>[Aniko] Even though runway's
a little bit different,</i>

05:39.039 --> 05:40.839
I know what it's like
putting myself out there

05:40.841 --> 05:42.307
in front of a group of people.

05:43.277 --> 05:44.543
[photographer speaking]

05:46.714 --> 05:49.181
I don't know what to do. Okay.

05:49.183 --> 05:54.319
I'm so excited, but also
super, super, super nervous.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.321
If I do something wrong,

05:56.323 --> 05:58.390
everything will just
be messed up.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.859
Do I smile? Do I what?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.594
Yeah, however you want.
There you go.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.296
- Yes!
- Ooh!

06:04.932 --> 06:06.164
I'm the youngest one there,

06:06.166 --> 06:08.200
the least experienced,

06:08.202 --> 06:10.736
and I wanna show them,
like, I can do this.

06:10.738 --> 06:14.506
And I wanna do a good job
and I wanna impress everybody.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.441
And especially,
I wanna impress my mom.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.576
Aw.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.311
I know you will.

06:19.313 --> 06:21.313
She'll be happy
no matter what happens.

06:23.951 --> 06:27.219
[gasps] Cherry,
it looks amazing!

06:27.221 --> 06:28.153
Oh, wow.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.788
Mmm-hmm!

06:29.790 --> 06:31.323
The stitching is great, too.

06:31.325 --> 06:33.325
Thank you. We really...

06:33.327 --> 06:35.127
[Cherry speaking]

06:35.996 --> 06:37.295
- Yeah.
- I know!

06:37.297 --> 06:39.030
[Cherry speaking]

06:52.446 --> 06:55.080
[Darcey] Look at the sparkles,
our bikinis look good.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.848
[Cherry speaking]

06:56.850 --> 06:58.417
On video chat, it looks amazing,

06:58.419 --> 07:00.919
but in person... wow.

07:00.921 --> 07:01.887
It's stunning.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.121
[Cherry speaking]

07:10.063 --> 07:11.329
[Darcey] You did an
amazing job. Look at that, sis.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.131
[Stacey] It's got our name
on it, Silva, like...

07:13.133 --> 07:15.367
[Darcey] I know.
Our collection.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.302
[Conrad speaking]

07:34.054 --> 07:35.487
[Georgi speaking]

07:37.124 --> 07:38.523
[Darcey]
Just try it on, Georgi.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.327
[Stacey] You guys don't wear
those in Europe?

07:46.333 --> 07:47.999
[Darcey] Yeah.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.035
Yeah. Walk, walk.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.838
You gotta fix it right,
you got camel toe!

07:52.840 --> 07:53.972
Thake this serious, Georgi.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.575
That's a nice cut
and a nice bit you're packing,

07:56.577 --> 07:58.376
- You'll... you'll...
- Put a sock.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.145
You'll make that
the number one seller.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.047
[Georgi speaking]

08:02.049 --> 08:04.216
Okay, Georgi, why don't you
wanna wear it?

08:04.218 --> 08:06.184
- You're walking our show.
- You need to wear the stretchy...

08:07.421 --> 08:08.954
[laughs]

08:13.126 --> 08:14.593
[imitates snake]

08:14.595 --> 08:15.961
What's [imitates snake]?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.296
[imitates snake]

08:39.319 --> 08:41.152
Well, you're not gonna
be jumping, honey.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.192
[Conrad speaking]

09:05.913 --> 09:08.513
It's a bikini brief and you wear
those in Europe all the time.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.952
Yeah, you have.
On the beach in Albania.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.054
So you can get a tan,
you don't get tan lines.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.325
I swear I thought you did.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.599
[Georgi speaking]

09:27.601 --> 09:30.001
- This is our collection.
- It's a big deal.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.605
We're launching our men's
swimwear collection.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.144
I mean, the whole irony
behind it all

09:39.146 --> 09:41.513
is that they're
professional models.

09:41.515 --> 09:42.981
- They've done this before.
- They've done this before.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.081
And they weren't...

09:44.083 --> 09:46.785
They've never denied...
many things in the past.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.821
Wearing anything, on a
shoot or on a runway show.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.823
They should be
our biggest supporter.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.192
And... I don't know
if they realize

09:54.194 --> 09:56.728
that they're causing
more difficulties

09:56.730 --> 09:59.097
and more stress
the day before the show.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.934
Guys, we've always
been there for you,

10:02.936 --> 10:04.202
can you just be there for us?

10:04.204 --> 10:06.004
We shouldn't have to beg you.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.761
- [Darcey] We're here!
- [Aniko] Yes! Woo!

10:29.763 --> 10:32.597
Fashion show time,
let's do this!

10:33.867 --> 10:36.101
Come on, walk the runway.
Go, come on.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.004
Today is the day
of the fashion show.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.071
I am so excited.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.974
But I can't help but feel
a little nervous

10:42.976 --> 10:45.877
<i>because we are debuting
our new swimwear collection,</i>

10:45.879 --> 10:49.381
so this has to go off
without a hitch.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.419
Runway show waiting to happen!
House Eleven in the house!

10:54.421 --> 10:56.154
Yeah, we got... Ooh!

11:02.996 --> 11:04.062
[woman speaking]

11:04.831 --> 11:06.965
[Darcey] Cherry. Conrad.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.935
- Mwah.
- You guys excited? You guys ready?

11:13.106 --> 11:15.407
Yeah. Girls, we gotta go
to hair and make-up.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.211
[Darcey] Okay.
Well, we'll see.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.780
Go start stuffing
your pants, let's go.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.214
[Conrad speaking]

11:23.216 --> 11:25.583
We worked with Conrad to rush
some pieces from our LA office

11:25.585 --> 11:26.885
for Georgi and Florian.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.822
And, hopefully, they fit
and they work.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.058
Or we're still gonna be
down two models.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.593
You're gonna have that hat on,

11:35.595 --> 11:37.595
but I think you should
still do, like, like a tan...

11:37.597 --> 11:40.065
[Florian speaking]

11:40.067 --> 11:41.933
[Stacey] We'll be right back.
You got the hair?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.935
- The hair?
- We got the hair, I have it over there.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.103
- Okay, great.
- Let's go.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.142
I... I'm, like...

11:51.144 --> 11:54.779
need to focus
and just breathe...

11:54.781 --> 11:56.014
[inhales deeply]

11:56.850 --> 11:58.516
But I'm freaking out.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.086
[woman]
So, who's wearing these?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.219
Cherry has the other one.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.955
This one's a brassiere,
you got the better one.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.824
<i>There's still so many things
that we need to do</i>

12:05.826 --> 12:07.358
<i>before the actual fashion show.</i>

12:07.360 --> 12:09.060
We gotta put our looks together,

12:09.062 --> 12:09.894
on the right model...

12:09.896 --> 12:11.362
[woman speaking loudly]

12:15.035 --> 12:17.135
<i>[Stacey] If the fashion show
is a hit,</i>

12:17.137 --> 12:20.839
people will be asking
to take our company global,

12:20.841 --> 12:23.742
so we can't have any mishaps.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.210
[woman continues speaking]

12:27.247 --> 12:29.380
<i>[Stacey] The fear is so thick.</i>

12:29.382 --> 12:31.082
I'm feeling it all over
my body right now.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.019
- This is the building?
- This is the building.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.955
I contacted a broker

12:36.957 --> 12:38.923
<i>and Florian and I are gonna
go look at an apartment</i>

12:38.925 --> 12:40.325
<i>here in Miami.</i>

12:40.327 --> 12:43.394
[realtor] Full bath, walk-in
closet... It's around 5,000.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.296
[Florian speaking]

12:45.298 --> 12:47.065
But I could see us here.

- Ah. [whistles]
- Wow.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.301
- You're on real form this morning, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.236
You had a good night
last night, huh?

25:42.008 --> 25:44.975
[Stacey] <i>We had the most
amazing, successful fashion show.</i>

25:44.977 --> 25:47.545
Your first professional
runway show in America.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.280
It's a big deal.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.096
Thank you.

26:06.098 --> 26:10.034
- Yeah. [whistles]
- Yeah, baby.

26:10.036 --> 26:14.305
- All right, then.
- Oh, I like this, Chef Florian.

26:14.307 --> 26:18.375
- Oh, smell of eggs.
- [Stacey] Hey. Good morning.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.210
[Florian] Wow.

26:20.212 --> 26:23.914
Good morning. You guys
ready for your new little vacay?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.215
- [Aniko and Aspen] Yeah, excited.
- Wow.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.384
So, you guys are
heading out today, right?

26:27.386 --> 26:30.921
Yeah, we're heading out. Do
you want to make 'em some eggs?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.256
[Georgi]

26:34.594 --> 26:37.027
- You guys have fun. Have fun.
- Bye, Auntie Stacey. Bye.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.096
[Florian]

26:39.098 --> 26:42.232
[Stacey] <i>Miami has really
been [sighs] an amazing journey,</i>

26:42.234 --> 26:45.703
and I want to keep the
momentum going for my family,

26:45.705 --> 26:48.939
for my business, for myself.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.909
So, before we head to the
airport and go back to Connecticut,

26:51.911 --> 26:55.012
<i>I have something
I want to show Florian</i>

26:55.014 --> 26:57.615
that could, potentially,
change our lives.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.584
- Bye, guys. Love you. Have fun.
- Bye, have fun.

27:01.887 --> 27:02.720
And I hope he likes it.

27:02.722 --> 27:06.624
[puffs]

27:11.197 --> 27:13.197
[Stacey] Right, this is it.
This is the building.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.132
- It's by the water.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.101
<i>[Stacey] I contacted a broker,</i>

27:17.103 --> 27:21.105
and Florian and I are going to go
look at an apartment near Miami.

27:21.107 --> 27:26.076
We got a nail salon over here. I
love this neighborhood Very clean.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.512
I've been thinking about
moving to Miami for a long time,

27:28.514 --> 27:31.015
and this trip
definitely solidified that.

27:31.017 --> 27:38.088
<i>Miami just makes you really want to
work harder and go for your dreams.</i>

27:38.090 --> 27:42.760
And I really hope that Florian
could see himself here too.

27:42.762 --> 27:46.530
- Welcome. Hi, how are you?
- Hey. Hello.

27:46.532 --> 27:47.965
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Good to see you.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.234
- You too.
- A pleasure. Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.070
- You want to see it?
- [Stacey] Yeah, let's do it.

27:53.072 --> 27:58.042
You have a full two bedroom,
three bath, one half bath.

27:58.044 --> 28:02.946
- Wow. Yes.
- This is one of the rooms. Full bath, walk-in closet.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.549
Tile. Very clean.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.852
[Broker] Towards the left here
you're gonna have a full kitchen,

28:08.854 --> 28:11.889
-all stainless steel appliances,
top of the line, -Yes, okay.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.858
- Which is gorgeous, yes.
- [Stacey] Mmm-hmm.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.262
- I can see myself cooking in here. Yes.
- There you go. Exactly.

28:19.098 --> 28:22.032
[Florian]

28:40.653 --> 28:42.953
- [Broker] Sub-zero refrigerator.
- [Stacey] Love it.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.089
- [Broker] How amazing are these views?
- [Stacey gasps]

28:45.091 --> 28:46.623
- Yeah.
- This view...

28:46.625 --> 28:49.359
- is unbelievable.
- [laughs]

28:49.361 --> 28:53.263
- Babe, hello? This is a dream come true.
- It is.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.166
To wake up to water views?

28:56.936 --> 28:59.470
I mean, that's kind of
what I want in life.

29:01.907 --> 29:05.342
But I feel, like, for what
you're getting it's worth it.

29:08.714 --> 29:13.016
- It's around 5,000.
- [Florian whistles]

29:13.018 --> 29:16.487
- This is the best of the best. This is, like, a dream pad.
- [sighs] It is.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.260
[sighs]

29:24.597 --> 29:26.029
[sighs]

29:42.281 --> 29:45.949
I know, but there's
opportunity here for you, too.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.988
But I can see us here.
I worked hard,

29:50.990 --> 29:53.357
and I feel like I've manifested

29:53.359 --> 29:55.959
things on my dream board,
and I feel like this is part of it.

29:55.961 --> 29:56.593
This is...

30:03.102 --> 30:05.169
So this is too fast for you?

30:12.211 --> 30:13.577
I mean, we can wait,

30:13.579 --> 30:17.447
but I see us definitely having
our dream wedding in Miami,

30:17.449 --> 30:19.349
a few weeks
at the end of the summer.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.890
I'm not joking.

30:26.892 --> 30:29.259
Yeah, you have.
We have to compromise.

30:32.198 --> 30:35.032
Yeah.

30:35.034 --> 30:39.336
I would love for us to have our dream
wedding in Miami at the end of the summer.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.470
[gulps]

30:43.809 --> 30:45.108
I love you too.

30:47.246 --> 30:50.147
I really appreciate that
Georgi wants to spend

30:50.149 --> 30:51.849
more time with me and the kids,

30:51.851 --> 30:55.419
but I'm worried
about his finances.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.192
<i>[Darcey] I feel like
I have to say something.</i>

31:10.302 --> 31:14.171
- [Georgi]
- [all cheering]

31:17.076 --> 31:19.476
- Okay.
- Oh, help.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.746
Today, we are going snorkeling

31:22.748 --> 31:24.281
which is also on my bucket list,

31:24.283 --> 31:26.183
so I can finally check that off.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.785
I honestly wonder
if Georgi's been,

31:28.787 --> 31:31.622
like, writing mental notes
of things I want to do.

31:31.624 --> 31:34.558
So far he got deep sea
fishing, he got snorkeling.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.593
I don't know what's next.
Like, shark cage diving?

31:36.595 --> 31:38.595
- That's one of my number one things.
- Hopefully he has

31:38.597 --> 31:41.598
something on my bucket list
because those definitely aren't, like,

31:41.600 --> 31:43.267
- the top of mine.
- What, like shopping?

31:43.269 --> 31:47.604
- Uh... [laughs]
- Shopping. Hello.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.275
[all] Yes.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.578
- No, I think we're okay.
- Maybe my mom needs one.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.313
[all laughing]

31:56.315 --> 31:58.148
I'm not a big swimmer
when it comes to

31:58.150 --> 31:59.249
swimming in the ocean.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.085
I don't mind a pool,
but I don't like open water.

32:02.087 --> 32:05.088
It's a bit of a fear
that I have.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.759
It's not the water itself,
it's just the depth of it

32:08.761 --> 32:13.630
and knowing that there's animals
down there that can, you know, bite you.

32:15.734 --> 32:20.070
- You'll be able to see sharks. Yeah, a lot of sharks.
- Oh.

32:20.072 --> 32:24.074
- [Darcey] Oh, boy.
- [Driver] And they're not going to do anything to you.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.055
- [screams]
- [Aniko and Aspen laugh]

32:40.025 --> 32:41.992
[Georgi]

32:55.874 --> 32:56.907
- [Driver] We're here.
- [all cheering]

32:56.909 --> 32:59.843
We're in a perfect
spot for snorkeling.

32:59.845 --> 33:02.079
This is your mask.
Make sure they're tight

33:02.081 --> 33:04.281
and they're sucked
into your face, okay?

33:04.283 --> 33:06.350
- They'll be fine.
- Oh, I just had a nose job.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.653
- Is that gonna be okay?
- Yeah, that's fine.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.189
- How do you breathe?
- You cannot breathe through your mouth

33:12.191 --> 33:14.791
or you'll get water into
the mask. [breathes in]

33:14.793 --> 33:17.194
But can you try
with the mouth piece on?

33:17.863 --> 33:20.063
I'm having
a panic attack, I think.

33:20.065 --> 33:22.132
- You shouldn't be. You're gonna be fine.
- How do you breathe out?

33:22.134 --> 33:24.434
Which way do I breathe out this?

33:24.436 --> 33:25.902
<i>[Darcey] You never know
what's down there.</i>

33:25.904 --> 33:27.104
I don't know.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.840
I don't know.
Me and Stacey had a dream,

33:29.842 --> 33:33.176
when we were younger, that
we were chased by a shark,

33:33.178 --> 33:37.381
and my dad had to, like, swim out
in the middle of the ocean to save us.

33:37.383 --> 33:43.020
Maybe that's a warning sign. Maybe
that's an omen. Maybe that's, you know...

33:43.789 --> 33:45.956
Don't go in too deep.

33:45.958 --> 33:49.126
- Be careful.
- I know, Mom.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.162
- Sit on the edge of the boat.
- Ready?

33:52.164 --> 33:53.764
- One, two, three.
- Woo!

33:53.766 --> 33:55.365
[Darcey] Oh, my God, Aniko.

33:56.001 --> 33:58.135
Mom needs to live a little.
Come on.

33:58.137 --> 34:01.605
Do something spontaneous.
Like, come on, girl.

34:02.941 --> 34:04.841
Oh, my God.

34:04.843 --> 34:10.047
Okay. Oh, no, no,
I can't do it.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.182
- Mom, we're drowning.
- No, no. I'm going to sink to the bottom.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.885
- Mom, we're drowning. Save your children.
- No. Oh, my God, Aniko.

34:14.887 --> 34:18.221
- Hold on.
- We're drowning. Help.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.257
- Don't say that. You're freaking me out.
- Help, we're drowning.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.925
Stop, don't say that.
Take it back.

34:21.927 --> 34:25.395
Aniko, Aspen, oh, my God.
Mommy's coming.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.130
[screams]

34:32.137 --> 34:33.170
Help.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.472
[coughs]

34:36.608 --> 34:37.941
[Aniko] Oh, I'm losing my...

34:39.411 --> 34:42.245
- Wait, wait, that's me, that's me.
- [screeching]

34:42.247 --> 34:44.481
- Wait.
- Help me.

34:44.483 --> 34:50.020
- [Darcey] Getting in that water I felt lost.
- [laughs]

34:50.022 --> 34:55.092
Like, I felt like it was, like, the
never-ending saga of deep ocean water,

34:55.094 --> 34:59.396
and it felt like hours went
by, and that [bleep] was scary.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.199
Oh, it was a freakin' nightmare.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.241
[Georgi sighs]

35:13.879 --> 35:16.680
<i>[Darcey] This snorkeling trip
was a great idea,</i>

35:16.682 --> 35:18.815
and I really appreciate
that Georgi wants to

35:18.817 --> 35:19.983
spend more time
with me and the kids,

35:19.985 --> 35:22.319
but I'm not 100%
comfortable with it

35:22.321 --> 35:24.421
because I know
he's not working right now,

35:25.190 --> 35:29.326
and I'm worried
about his finances.

35:32.064 --> 35:35.332
Thank you for today.
Appreciate it.

35:48.547 --> 35:53.717
It's hard because I feel, like, after
the Michael thing and us trying to be

35:53.719 --> 35:57.220
in a better place in our
relationship, I just don't really know

35:57.222 --> 35:59.856
how to approach it with Georgi
because I don't want to start a fight,

35:59.858 --> 36:02.626
<i>but I feel like
I have to say something.</i>

36:05.330 --> 36:08.632
You paid for the deep sea
fishing, and then this, I mean...

36:10.202 --> 36:12.302
I know these
boat rentals aren't cheap,

36:12.304 --> 36:15.338
and I know it's hard
right now for you.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.541
Just a little worried about
the money you're spending.

36:28.987 --> 36:32.289
Thank you for today.
Appreciate it.

36:34.760 --> 36:38.061
And you paid for the deep sea
fishing and then this. I mean...

36:38.063 --> 36:40.597
Just a little worried about
the money you're spending.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.166
I mean, I know these
boat rentals aren't cheap,

36:43.168 --> 36:46.469
and I know it's hard
right now for you.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.506
How much is it costing you?

36:57.950 --> 37:01.952
I mean, I can help
pay for this, if you want.

37:06.225 --> 37:09.960
Yeah, and I love that.
I feel like, you know,

37:09.962 --> 37:13.763
the deep sea fishing
and this has really helped,

37:13.765 --> 37:16.633
you know, us
and the kids all bond, and...

37:20.005 --> 37:21.404
Yeah, but you have to
have a plan of action.

37:21.406 --> 37:24.007
You know, bills add up.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.283
I think that's great.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.485
I understand that.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.720
I see that you're
being proactive,

38:10.722 --> 38:13.123
and that makes me
feel rest assured

38:13.125 --> 38:15.892
that you're able to
help financially

38:15.894 --> 38:18.028
at some point in time
in the near future.

38:18.030 --> 38:22.866
I just want us to be transparent and
honest with each other about money.

38:22.868 --> 38:27.504
It's a tough topic to have in a
relationship but it needs to be discussed.

38:31.109 --> 38:34.311
I'm glad that you're going to be
able to sit down and map that out,

38:34.313 --> 38:37.280
plan it out, because
I want us to raise the,

38:37.282 --> 38:40.050
you know,
raise the bar together.

38:47.326 --> 38:50.527
- Yeah. I love you for that. Thank you.
- I love you too.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.128
I love you, baby.

38:52.130 --> 38:55.198
<i>[Darcey] I really hope Georgi's
serious about this rose oil business.</i>

38:55.200 --> 38:58.601
He says he has some investors,
and I think it could be a great success.

38:59.738 --> 39:03.940
All right, are you guys ready?
Come on over.

39:03.942 --> 39:07.744
<i>[Darcey] I want to see him truly
succeed in the things that he desires,</i>

39:07.746 --> 39:11.247
and I want to be able to support
him with that dream that he has.

39:11.249 --> 39:14.751
<i>But I'm a little nervous because
I feel, like, starting a company,</i>

39:14.753 --> 39:16.119
<i>it's hard work, you know?</i>

39:16.121 --> 39:19.456
And he's not gonna be able
to make money right away,

39:19.458 --> 39:23.126
but I just have to trust what he says,
for now, and hope it all works out.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.364
Yeah, thank you.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.167
- Yeah, I had fun. Thank you.
- Yeah, it was really fun.

39:31.169 --> 39:34.204
We should do it again
sometime. Not. [laughs]

39:34.206 --> 39:37.540
-[all laughing] -[laughs]
You guys can. I'll watch.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.360
- What?
- All right, let's hurry.

39:57.362 --> 39:59.162
We'll go get ready
and get dolled up.

39:59.164 --> 40:00.330
Bye.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.286
- All right, Mom.
- Yes, baby?

40:56.288 --> 40:58.121
- We need to cover your eyes.
- Oh.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.089
- And we do the...
- I have glasses on.

41:00.091 --> 41:02.492
All right. Put them up. Come
on, we've got to cover your eyes.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.538
- [Aniko] Oh, my God.
- [gasps]

41:22.080 --> 41:24.881
Okay, ready
to tighten that tush.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.316
- It's going to 100%.
- All right.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.951
- Oh.
- [woman laughs]

41:27.953 --> 41:29.319
Oh.

41:29.321 --> 41:33.323
We're gonna celebrate America.

41:33.325 --> 41:35.258
<i>[Stacey] Florian just got
his green card.</i>

41:36.928 --> 41:37.861
Woo!

41:37.929 --> 41:40.964
Congratulations, baby.

41:40.966 --> 41:45.068
He has an opportunity in the furniture
business and in the modeling industry.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.171
- Show me the money, baby.
- [both laugh]

41:48.173 --> 41:49.939
I can't believe
this is gonna be the last time

41:49.941 --> 41:51.674
we're all gonna
be here together.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.344
- There's a lot of memories in that house.
- True.

41:54.346 --> 41:56.946
<i>[Darcey] Our dad finally sold
his house, and we're all going</i>

41:56.948 --> 41:58.982
<i>to say our final goodbyes.</i>

41:58.984 --> 42:03.086
And we're ready to embark on a
new life, a new future, and a new home.

42:03.088 --> 42:06.656
- One, two, three...
- [all] Super!

42:06.658 --> 42:08.992
[Mike] This is [bleep] up.

42:08.994 --> 42:11.294
Every [bleep] time you girls
want to do something

42:11.296 --> 42:13.129
you disrupt everybody's life.

42:13.131 --> 42:15.164
It's a shock.
Can't understand it.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.033
It just does not
make sense to me.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.835
You're putting your [bleep] life

42:18.837 --> 42:20.603
into a situation.

42:20.605 --> 42:23.206
- No.
- You are. You are.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.276
Train wreck coming
down the tracks.
