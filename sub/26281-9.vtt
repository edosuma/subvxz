12:05.993 --> 12:07.160
which is causing him
to move,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.062
which is affecting
our imagery.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.597
He's scared.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.899
I'm talking to him
to calm him down

12:11.965 --> 12:13.500
which is improving
our imagery.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.668
The fact that I like him
is beside the point.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.271
You grow up in San Jose?

12:18.338 --> 12:21.809
East Paly, but I got out
of there as soon as I could...

12:21.875 --> 12:22.943
I was 15.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.244
Your parents still there?

12:25.012 --> 12:26.379
Mom's gone,

12:26.446 --> 12:29.549
dear old Dad is terrible.

12:29.616 --> 12:30.851
Siblings?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.152
Little brother...

12:32.219 --> 12:33.420
He's gone too.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.993
Crappy dad.
Lost his brother...

12:40.060 --> 12:42.162
I mean,
you really don't ha...
He's not scared.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.665
He's short of breath
because his diaphragm
is lacerated.

12:45.732 --> 12:50.337
His stomach has passed
through that tear
and is now in his chest.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.773
Billy needs emergency surgery
on his diaphragm.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.544
DR. PARK: The defect
reaches all the way

12:57.610 --> 13:00.147
from the center
to the anterior costal margin.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.849
DR. LIM:
So what do we need to do?

13:01.915 --> 13:04.051
Divide the inferior
pulmonary ligament
to bring the lung upwards.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.753
Uh-huh.
Mesh.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.292
Whoever kicked him was
wearing some serious footwear.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.495
And they'll be waiting for him
when he goes back.
Unless we help him.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.797
Dr. Park wants
to fix his forehead.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.601
The constitution
guarantees prisoners

13:21.668 --> 13:23.303
get the same care
as everyone else.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.739
Most non-prisoners
can't afford
cosmetic surgery.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.242
He would be getting
better care
than everyone else.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.013
Kid is smart and personable
and puts up a great front.
But he's scared to death.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.015
And he got 36 months
for selling weed,

13:35.082 --> 13:36.749
a crime that doesn't
even exist anymore.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.485
You think his life
would be anything like this

13:38.551 --> 13:40.387
if he didn't grow up
with a massive dent
in his head?

13:41.955 --> 13:44.624
Sorry,
I'm not convinced.

13:44.691 --> 13:48.128
Is that because you don't have
any empathy for Billy?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.731
No. It's because
I agree with you.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.167
It's expensive, risky
and unnecessary.

13:54.234 --> 13:57.504
But empathy can be
an invaluable motivator,

13:57.570 --> 14:00.941
Dr. Murphy, that truly
connects the physician
with their patient.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.747
(WHISPERS)
Is he still up there?

14:07.814 --> 14:10.417
**

14:14.587 --> 14:16.656
(WHISPERS) Yes he is.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.128
We can't do the castration,
George.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.830
Not without the proper
psychiatric clearance.

14:23.897 --> 14:24.965
That'll take forever.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.733
Just a few months.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.335
A few months is forever.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.304
Binge watch
your favorite shows,
catch up on your reading.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.006
You attracted to men,
Dr. Reznick?

14:34.074 --> 14:36.609
Yes. Adult men.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.812
And if that
were reprehensible,

14:39.879 --> 14:41.214
do you think
you could stop?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.953
You have no idea
what it's like

14:46.019 --> 14:47.754
to live
with these thoughts.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.024
I hate them,

14:51.091 --> 14:53.060
and I hate myself
for having them.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.496
But I can't stop them.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.433
And I'm afraid
of what I could do.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.936
**

15:05.238 --> 15:07.440
We will start the process
immediately.

15:07.507 --> 15:11.044
In the meantime,
we'll transfuse you,
get you on antibiotics...

15:11.111 --> 15:14.347
No.
I'm refusing treatment.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.285
No transfusion.
No antibiotics.
No repair.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.852
Let 'em rot.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.058
We have something
in common.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.662
Neither of us has
a driver's license.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.902
How do you feel about
not having a driver's license?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.606
I'm pissed, Shaun.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.374
You feel pissed.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.343
Yes, I feel pissed.
I feel very pissed

15:43.410 --> 15:46.013
because something important
was taken away from me.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.547
And by a friend.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.616
You feel very pissed

15:49.682 --> 15:52.352
because something important
was taken away from you,

15:52.419 --> 15:53.653
and by a friend.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.688
And parroting everything
I say isn't helping.

15:56.889 --> 16:00.027
I'm finding commonality,
Dr. Glassman,

16:00.093 --> 16:02.729
and inquiring
about your emotional state,

16:02.795 --> 16:05.798
and actively listening
by restating your responses.

16:05.865 --> 16:09.636
"External corroboration
enhances our sense
of self-worth."

16:10.870 --> 16:12.905
Okay.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.075
The day after I got
my driver's license,

16:15.142 --> 16:16.776
you want to know
what I did?

16:16.843 --> 16:21.581
I went out and bought
a 1963 Galaxie, Midnight Blue.
1,255 bucks,

16:21.648 --> 16:26.486
every penny I earned
for the past three years
working in a gas station.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.954
How do you think
that made me feel?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.123
You liked it?

16:30.190 --> 16:32.392
No, Shaun.
I loved it.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.926
You want to know why?

16:33.993 --> 16:37.030
Because a car
to a 16-year-old kid
means independence,

16:37.097 --> 16:38.931
which means he can go
wherever he wants

16:38.998 --> 16:40.767
whenever he wants.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.670
And that doesn't change
with age, Shaun,

16:45.472 --> 16:46.906
in fact,
it means even more.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.046
When you took my license,
that's what you took from me.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.684
I don't expect you
to understand.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.186
So you don't have
to pretend.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.632
Hey.
Is Andrews stalking you?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.
It's annoying.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.002
We need to stand together
and tell him to back off.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.170
(LAUGHS)

17:17.237 --> 17:18.971
I'm not telling the president
he's annoying.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.707
He's infringing
on our autonomy

17:20.773 --> 17:22.642
and inhibiting
the free flow of ideas,

17:22.709 --> 17:24.177
both of which affect
our ability

17:24.244 --> 17:26.045
to deliver
the best patient care.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.450
That sounds
slightly better.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.219
Okay. I'm in.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.259
Are you?
No. Of course not.

17:39.326 --> 17:42.162
The last thing I'm gonna do
right now is confront him.
I'm the front-runner.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.464
Not according to Vegas.
I'm 3 to 2.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.633
(LAUGHS)

17:46.699 --> 17:49.202
Guess they don't know that you
have double my mortality rate.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.839
I'm a trauma surgeon,

17:52.905 --> 17:54.874
you're comparing apples
to asshats.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.077
I resent
being called an apple.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.149
The diaphragm repair
went very well.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.517
And we've scheduled
your orbital fracture repair.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.754
We'll get you some stronger
pain meds for the recovery.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.689
When are you gonna
fix my forehead,

18:09.756 --> 18:11.090
make me all John Legend?

18:13.760 --> 18:16.529
I tried, Billy.
I'm sorry.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.832
I wasn't really getting
my hopes up anyway.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.202
My dad taught me that.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.471
He'd say,
"You know what, Billy?"

18:24.537 --> 18:27.106
And he'd just punch me
in the face.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.676
At least, I think
that was the lesson
he was trying to impart.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.278
That's what happened
to your forehead?

18:34.714 --> 18:36.549
He was a big A's fan.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.651
Watched every game
with a bat in his hand.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.590

I got every answer correct
on the written test.

19:33.973 --> 19:37.109
Except one,
but that was because
it was improperly worded.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.280
I told the DMV
they need to rewrite it

19:40.347 --> 19:43.750
and they said they'd
take it under advisement.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.084

the yellow steel thingy
at the entrance
of the parking lot

a lot of damage...

that is 15 feet
from the corner

with the stop sign that
someone put a "Hate"
sticker on

20:38.838 --> 20:41.073
so it says "Stop Hate,"

20:41.140 --> 20:43.776

of the Jiff-E Mart,

20:43.843 --> 20:46.646

of visualization.

And now that
we're feeling comfortable
about our surroundings,

20:54.854 --> 20:56.689
we can put the car
into drive,

off the brake...

I'll note his scrotum
is already beyond repair

23:35.181 --> 23:37.717
and surgical castration
is our only option.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.219

No.

23:40.286 --> 23:42.822
I'm not gonna let anyone
falsify medical records.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.525
Not for pain.
Not for a pedophile.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.960
Once his testes
are actually beyond repair,

23:48.027 --> 23:49.496
we will castrate him.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.031
So we're just gonna
leave him there screaming,

23:52.098 --> 23:53.733
keeping his entire unit
awake?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.235
Move him.

24:04.043 --> 24:07.614
DR. LIM: I'd like a clean
dissection through
the periosteal planes

24:07.680 --> 24:10.082
so I can slip the MEDPOR mesh
over the fracture.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.485
Why do I prefer
MEDPOR mesh?

24:12.552 --> 24:14.721
It allows
fibrovascular ingrowth

24:14.787 --> 24:16.689
and integration
of the patient's tissue.

we could justify dental work
as needed

24:37.109 --> 24:39.045
You feel guilty.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.080
Think that's maybe clouding
your judgment?

24:42.414 --> 24:43.716
Maybe.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.089
You're afraid
of ruffling Andrews' feathers
this close to decision day.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.591
Think that's maybe
clouding yours?

24:52.725 --> 24:55.261
We could give Billy
a breast implant.

24:58.030 --> 25:02.134
We could insert it
over his split thickness
frontal bone defect.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.738
It would only require
a tiny incision
at his eyebrow.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.506
Now you're in favor
of this?

25:07.574 --> 25:11.778
I was against it
because it was too expensive
and unnecessary and risky,

25:11.844 --> 25:13.379
but if we do it now,

25:13.445 --> 25:15.715
it won't require
any additional surgery,

25:15.782 --> 25:17.684
and it'd be
very economical.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.486
He did give us verbal consent
when he was first admitted.

he's backing off.
