00:01.293 --> 00:02.499
CARTER: It wasjust
a normal day in Eureka.

00:02.878 --> 00:03.867
Day's not over yet.

00:04.254 --> 00:05.835
Yeah. Like that was
going to last.

00:06.215 --> 00:09.002
Hello, 1947.
Confused? Let me clarify.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.250
The five of us got
transported back in time

00:11.386 --> 00:13.593
through some wormhole thingy
thanks to the Bridge Device.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.174
We eventually found
our way back home,

00:15.307 --> 00:17.764
but, surprise, home wasn't
exactly the way we left it.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.345
Henry? Married.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.268
Zane and Jo? Never dated.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.932
But Jo's in charge
of G.D. Security.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.768
Kevin? Different,
much to Allison's surprise.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.891
And Fargo?
Head of Global Dynamics,

00:28.028 --> 00:29.359
much to everyone's surprise.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.982
Oh, and Dr. Old Spice
hitched a ride with us
back to the present,

00:32.241 --> 00:33.981
but there's one crappy rule.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.108
We can't tell anyone.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.031
If people ever found out
about our trip,
there'd be trouble.

00:39.998 --> 00:43.081
And I finally kissed Allison,
and then she kissed me.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.127
But that's Eureka for you.
Same town, big changes.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.629
HENRY: Previously on Eureka...

00:50.050 --> 00:51.039
Trevor Grant?

00:51.468 --> 00:52.708
How do you know my name?

00:52.844 --> 00:55.802
I believe you knew my
father, Adam, back in 1947.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.003
Who are you?

00:58.725 --> 01:01.967
My name is Beverly Barlowe

01:02.104 --> 01:05.471
and we've been waiting
a very long time for you.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.988
BEVERLY: You don't believe me.
GRANT: What? That you're
Adam Barlowe's daughter?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.862
Seems improbable.

01:14.116 --> 01:17.108
As improbable as
taking a trip 60 years
into the future?

01:17.244 --> 01:18.450
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.786
We hoped the bottle of wine
would be convincing.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.454
My father said
it was your favorite.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.125
Hey, no more games.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.076
Barlowe's been dead
for 10 years, I checked.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.581
So, who are we?

01:28.714 --> 01:30.295
The group you
and my father created,

01:30.424 --> 01:32.085
the philosophy
you established.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.208
We were a handful of people,
we had an ideal then.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.171
And now there
are thousands of us.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.264
Scientists,
politicians, thinkers.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.302
We're the watchdogs
working to control
scientific developments.

01:44.688 --> 01:48.180
Anything to prevent
another tragedy like
we saw in 1945.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.938
Nuclear weapons.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.357
Technology's most
regrettable achievement.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.355
And not the last.

01:58.201 --> 02:02.661
This is our latest concern.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.415
DED?
Directed EMP device.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.877
Satel l ite—based
electromagnetic
pulse array.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.623
Eradicates all electronics
in a 1000—mile radius,

02:14.760 --> 02:17.092
sending an entire country
back to the Stone Age.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.085
It's a weapon of domination.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.548
And it's being tested
at Global Dynamics.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.141
| find that hard to believe.
I know these people.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.511
Then check it out
for yourself, Dr. Grant.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.483
Because we need
your help to stop them.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.486
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

02:45.540 --> 02:46.825
(JO LAUGHS)

02:48.418 --> 02:51.000
What? What?
Got something on me?

02:51.880 --> 02:54.997
Wow, the rhythm has
definitely got you. Yeah.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.676
Yeah.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.088
Hey, everybody.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.674
Listen, Grace and I
would just like to
thank you all for coming.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.050
We hit a...
Bit of a...

03:06.186 --> 03:08.017
Well, tough time.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.647
For a while.
But it made us
appreciate...

03:14.319 --> 03:16.605
To new beginnings.
ALL: To new beginnings.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.325
Oh, you guys are
so junior high prom.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.619
What?
I'll see you later, Dad.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.034
CARTER: Where are you going?
Um, people are
swimming at the lake,

03:29.167 --> 03:31.078
and Zane said he might
try to stop by.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.951
Okay, have fun.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.036
Whatever, judge—y.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.418
I didn't even say anything!
Are you kidding?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.714
Well, look, crushes are
complicated, you know?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.344
Don't even say it.
Oh, you know what
she's thinking about?

03:43.515 --> 03:45.631
She's thinking about
this guy named Mike
that went to Caltech,

03:45.767 --> 03:49.931
and you let him
cheat off your paper
during midterms. You did.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.183
He had the most
beautiful...
Eyelashes, really?

03:52.816 --> 03:54.397
Seriously?
What's going on
with you guys?

03:54.526 --> 03:57.142
They've been finishing
each other's sentences
all day.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.444
You know that PTSD therapy
I've been working on?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.064
Well, I adapted
the interface to use
with Henry.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.992
So, we've been sharing
memories across timelines.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.865
Oh, you've been cheating.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.909
Yes.
Oh, that's great.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.286
Dr. Monroe. Henry.
Hey.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.876
Sorry I'm late. I was
having coffee with a friend,
lost track of time.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.211
That's quite all right,
glad you could make it.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.877
You got a Scotch?
Uh, no, but we got some
beer and champagne.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.960
Hey Douglas, I hear you're
testing the DED today.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.838
Mind ifl come along as part
of my continuing education?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.384
Yeah, sure.
It'll be a laugh a minute.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.553
General Mansfield's
coming by to yell
at me in person

04:29.686 --> 04:30.892

04:31.396 --> 04:32.897
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

04:33.190 --> 04:34.145
Like that.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.684
Oh, man. What's that,
some kind of power surge?

04:35.817 --> 04:39.230
No. I put an interrupted
emissions loop to stop
that kind of feedback.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.523
I'm sorry. You okay?
Yeah, yeah, no. I'm fine.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.735
(SIGHS)
New beginnings!

04:44.993 --> 04:46.949
ALL: New beginnings.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.874
I thought you went
to the lake.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.412
Yeah? Who told you that?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.412
Someone who's totally
inappropriate for you
to even think of.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.418
Admit it, you're
just doing it to
mess with her dad.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.298
It's just a crush.
lt's harmless.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.588
And, yeah, maybe I'm
milking it to mess
with Carter a little bit.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.258
What do you care?
Any time now, gentlemen.

05:07.849 --> 05:11.091
Easy. When you're
building a doomsday machine,
details matter.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.307
DED is not a weapon.
It's a defensive
countermeasure

05:14.439 --> 05:15.940
in case of
electronic attack.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.483
Whatever helps you
sleep at night.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.942
And we're ready.
Grab some popcorn
and take a seat, General.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.854
GRANT: I don't usually
agree with Dr. Donovan,

05:23.990 --> 05:25.981
but I do share
his concern on this one.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.950
What, you don't think
we should be able
to defend ourselves?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.114
I didn't say that.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.120
We build weapons
to defend ourselves,

05:32.249 --> 05:34.581
forces our enemies
to create newer weapons
to defend themselves.

05:34.709 --> 05:35.960
Where does it stop?

05:36.086 --> 05:40.079
Here we go.
For this test, we'll be
using 0.4% power potential.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.260
FARGO: Shutting down.

05:58.942 --> 05:59.931
(GROANS)

06:06.575 --> 06:07.690
Are you okay?
You okay, buddy?

06:07.826 --> 06:10.568
It must have been some kind
of transient anomaly from
one of the couplings.

06:10.704 --> 06:14.242
An anomaly I trust
will be fixed before
next week's field test.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.411
Good as done.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.158
Good.

Hi.

Headache, no concussion.
Actually he just left
if you want to catch him.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.969
Um, I could do that.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.177
Or I could

06:38.148 --> 06:39.979
stay here
and ask you out.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.144
Hmm. I'll have to
think about that.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.266
Okay.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.816

the Da Vinci bridge.
I got to...

07:00.462 --> 07:02.043
See you later.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.625
Yes, you will.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.134
Well, that explains a lot.

07:10.347 --> 07:14.636
Oh, Tess, um, I had
no idea that you were here.

peaks tomorrow night.

the best view.

I did not expect
to see that, though.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.188
It's not what you think.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.979
Oh, yeah, making
bedroom eyes with my ex?

07:25.487 --> 07:26.727
It's not exactly
what you think.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.229
I should have
seen this coming.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.527

Listen, I have to go
help my team set up.

catching up with you, Al.

staring at me.

a mistake, Jo,

Zoe thing.

nothing in common.

not a criminal?

08:15.578 --> 08:16.567
No.

before some idiot's experiment
failed miserably

pathway home.

know the difference.

the look on your face.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.378
No.
I'm going to go find Allie.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.716
What? You...

12:06.226 --> 12:09.218
And this is the rotunda
of Global Dynamics.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.933
As you can see it's
very big and rotund.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.306
Do you guys have
a Tesla coil?

12:14.776 --> 12:16.186
Yeah, we have
lots of coils.

12:16.319 --> 12:20.062
Hey, and look who
finally decided to join us.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.689
Welcome future scientists,
and congratulations

12:22.825 --> 12:24.736
on winning such
a prestigious internship.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.568
You enjoying
the tour so far?

12:26.704 --> 12:29.241
She put us
in a security cell while
she went to the bathroom.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.539
What?
Okay, I had to go.

12:33.044 --> 12:36.457
Well, I'm Dr. Douglas Fargo,
and I'm the director here.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.288
You see that
big office up there?

12:38.424 --> 12:39.539
That's mine.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.383
This entire facility
is mine.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.004
And when my employees
ignore important deadlines,

12:46.224 --> 12:48.590
it's my job to whip
them into shape.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.687
(CLEARS THROAT)
Tesla coils in section two.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.020
All right, everyone,
right this way.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.945
You're just going to
let him talk to you like that?

13:06.077 --> 13:06.987
Excuse me?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.657
Hard to be
the lead dog with your
tail between your legs.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.088
Hi, what are
you working on?

13:21.551 --> 13:25.214
Hey. Well, you remember
the nanobots that helped
you quit smoking?

13:25.555 --> 13:27.546
You decided to deprive
more people of the pleasure?

13:27.682 --> 13:33.348
(LAUGHS) No. But I may have
found a way to adapt it
to target cancer cells.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.312
Wow, that's amazing.
That's really amazing.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.525
Something bothering you?

13:42.196 --> 13:44.232
Yes. Yes, there is actually.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.528
What do you know about
this weapon they're
testing in Section Five?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.827
The DED device?
Well, you see, you're
doing it as well now.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.996
Doing what?
You're avoiding calling
it a weapon.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.709
It's a Department
of Defense project.

13:55.877 --> 13:56.912
This is a DOD facility.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.627
Yeah, but it shouldn't be.
It's not what I...

14:01.758 --> 14:03.794
It's not how we
envisioned the place to be.

14:06.554 --> 14:11.890
l distinctly remember
being in 1947 and seeing
more soldiers than scientists.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.641
That was right
after the war.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.055
We were trying to get
this place off the ground.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.974
So, you think we should
just scrap the whole project?

14:17.106 --> 14:21.019
I think science should be
about discovery, not about
who can build the biggest gun.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.564
This nanobot research
that I'm working on,

14:23.696 --> 14:25.903
the research that
| used to save your life,

14:27.033 --> 14:28.944
they don't give you funding
for this kind of thing

14:29.077 --> 14:31.693
if you don't also work
on projects for the military.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.283
| see I'm not going
to win this argument.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.330
I didn't realize
we were arguing.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.079
I'll let you get
back to your work.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.839
Seriously?
You haven't hit that?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.586
Okay, Tess. Listen.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.966
Um, I may have been
a little abrupt earlier.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.520
Have you spoken
with Carter?

14:56.646 --> 14:59.979
Oh, oh, I don't have
anything to say to him that
hasn't already been said,

15:00.108 --> 15:03.100
except maybe don't
date my best friend.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.522
But I assumed
that was a given.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.566
Listen, Tess,
I'm really sorry.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.529
Al, we need to talk.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.323
HENRY: Oh, my gosh,
astonishing.
CARTER: Yeah.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.115
Listen, I'm going to have
to run some molecular scans

15:18.459 --> 15:22.293
to check for
structural weaknesses.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.753
Yeah, that's, um...

15:27.051 --> 15:29.292
Henry, I got to
talk to you for a sec.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.463
Stark's back.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.175
(LAUGHING)

15:39.188 --> 15:41.179
Okay.
It's a bit
like that.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.304
What?

15:42.900 --> 15:43.889
Uh...

15:44.861 --> 15:47.853
Nathan. He was
in my office
about an hour ago.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.446
Bane of my existence,
he's... He's back.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.903
That's impossible.
I mean, you saw him...

15:53.035 --> 15:54.650
Vaporize. Yeah.
De—materialize.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.993
That's right.
Yeah, well,

15:56.122 --> 15:57.783
I wonder what
pulled him back.

15:58.583 --> 16:02.417
I'd put my money
on that electro—pulse
gun thing, the...

16:02.753 --> 16:05.210
No, the DED works
on completely
different principles.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.079
I mean, it affects
electronics,

16:08.801 --> 16:12.293
not structures or people,
or at least not theoretically.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

16:12.763 --> 16:14.594
Well, there's
that word again.

lt's Allison.

16:20.271 --> 16:21.260
Hi.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.978
Yeah, I got to
talk to you too.

Uh—huh.

You're doing that thing
you do when you're nervous.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.238
NATHAN: Hey, Carter.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.452
You all done playing
doctor with your robot?
(GROANS)

16:45.880 --> 16:48.542
So, we thought that
it would be a good idea

16:48.674 --> 16:50.960
if we all sat down
and cleared the air.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.051
Agood... Um...

16:54.847 --> 16:56.963
You know, you guys
have a lot to talk about.
I'm gonna go.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.715
No, you're the person
that we need to talk to.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.689
This should be fun.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.271
(CARTER SlGHS)

get you two?

17:17.954 --> 17:18.943

17:23.834 --> 17:25.210
Do you see
anyone sitting there?

| see Tess sitting there.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.048
What do you see?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.265
Well, this is awkward.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.310
So, you're seeing Nathan?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.729
Well, notjust seeing him.
He smacked me in the head.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.694
How can you do that
if you're not real?

17:55.074 --> 17:57.406
Hallucinations can
be incredibly vivid,

17:57.952 --> 18:01.069
even creating
the illusion of the touch.

What is he saying?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.071
(MOUTHING)
Um...

18:05.251 --> 18:08.163
Um, not so much
talking. Sniffing.

18:10.881 --> 18:11.836
So, what about Tess?

Oh, I'm here,

her regards.

this wasn't a date.

about this with these?

anything about me?

misses me.

that destroyed my jeep
and the bridge, huh?

20:02.743 --> 20:05.906
No, the DED is
an electro—magnetic flux
compression generator.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.575
It only works
on electronics.
He's getting good.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.073
It can't be
a coincidence, though,

20:10.209 --> 20:12.541
that all the things
started happening
right after the test.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.082

detecting an anomalous
energy reading, Douglas.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.167

in the power coupling.

Well, then the whole
place could come down
over our heads.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.438
Okay, we got to shut this
thing down so we can
figure out what's going on.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.100
That's the thing,
it is shut down.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.021
I say we destroy it,

20:35.276 --> 20:36.937
and that way, we scuttle
the project completely.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.818

for your opinion.

would be hallucinating?

hallucinating Zane?

23:25.487 --> 23:27.023
HENRY: Well, the power surge
during the barbecue

23:27.156 --> 23:29.772
could have amplified
the signal from our

23:38.918 --> 23:40.783
and maybe that
somehow protected us.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.956
And since I adapted
the technology
to work with you

23:43.088 --> 23:45.295
in the absence of
another person to
share the experience,

23:45.424 --> 23:47.255
their mind must have
created one from their
own memories.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.376
This is great,
really, but can't
we just shut it off?

23:50.512 --> 23:52.639
I mean, I'm tired of
hearing about the
shoes l have to fill.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.172

23:55.059 --> 23:55.798
Just saying.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.266
GRACE: It isn't that easy.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.727
Hallucinations are
manifestations of our
fears and insecurities.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.977
And since the technology
was designed for
therapeutic purposes...

24:04.109 --> 24:06.691
If we have unresolved
issues with the people
that we're seeing,

24:06.820 --> 24:09.402
we have to work
past them before
they will go away.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.817
Oh, that sounds like fun.
I'll start.

24:13.911 --> 24:14.866
What is that?

24:14.995 --> 24:16.951
Well, this is what
I was trying to talk
to you about earlier.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.662
The bridge and your Jeep

24:18.791 --> 24:22.204
gradually exposed to
their own resonant
frequencies.

24:22.336 --> 24:25.999
They literally
shook themselves apart.

24:35.975 --> 24:36.930
You all right?

24:37.059 --> 24:39.675
Yeah. You?
Yeah.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.138
That was a little
too close to home.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.353
CARTER: Yeah, what's
the frequency, Kenneth?

24:43.649 --> 24:45.856
Or resonance, whatever.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.852
Every object has
its own natural mode
at which it vibrates,

24:48.988 --> 24:51.650
and if it's exposed
to sound waves that
match its frequency,

24:51.782 --> 24:53.864
then it oscillates
at an increasing
magnitude until...

24:53.993 --> 24:56.075
Until it shakes
itself apart, got it.
Exactly.

24:56.537 --> 24:57.822
But the frequency
that caused this

24:57.955 --> 24:59.991
is different than
whatever destroyed
your car at the bridge.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.791
Well, what's
causing it then?

25:01.917 --> 25:03.908
Some kind of
acoustic oscillator.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.535
I mean, more powerful
than anything I've ever seen.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.830
Well, Fargo said the DED
weapon was building an energy.

25:08.966 --> 25:12.584
Could that be
activating or interacting
with another experiment?

25:12.970 --> 25:14.835
It's possible. I'll tell you
what, we'll check it out.

25:14.972 --> 25:15.961

25:17.933 --> 25:19.434
Ah, oh, hey,
are you okay?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.516
Yeah, it'sjust
an abrasion. I'm fine.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.634
Yeah, you are.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.192
it's good to see him.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.869
But it would make sense
that you would be
seeing him given,

25:41.290 --> 25:43.076

the fact that
you and l are...

25:45.002 --> 25:46.788

you're seeing Tess?

25:47.087 --> 25:48.327
Oh, go ahead

25:48.922 --> 25:51.299

both times you lost
the man that you loved

25:51.425 --> 25:53.837

that same thing's
going to happen to him.

Afternoon, Doc.

26:31.215 --> 26:32.705

but G.D. needs someone
who can stand up to them.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.026
If the DED weapon was
the source of the problems,

29:04.076 --> 29:06.943
then why was the
bridge affected first?

29:07.704 --> 29:08.910
It does seem backwards.

it from the outside.

Well, ifthey're
using an oscillator
to excite the weapon

30:05.012 --> 30:06.798

why there's an
energy buildup.

30:06.930 --> 30:07.885

it goes critical?

33:46.024 --> 33:46.979
I "likey" to barf.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.097
Okay.

33:48.944 --> 33:49.854
Go over there.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.440
SOLDIER:
A little bit further.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.655
This is a mistake.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.248
And you told him that.
What else could
you have done?

34:02.624 --> 34:05.957
How about grow a pair
and actually stop this?

34:06.419 --> 34:08.410
Sorry. Did I use
my outside voice?

34:08.630 --> 34:11.337
lfl don't stand up to
General Mansfield,
I don't deserve this job.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.298
JESSICA: When did you
ever deserve it?

34:13.843 --> 34:14.832
The job was handed to you.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.801
Hey, whatever that
little brat's saying,

34:16.930 --> 34:17.885
she's wrong.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.505
Carter, Allison, Henry
and me, if we didn't
think you could do this,

34:20.642 --> 34:21.631
you wouldn't be here.

34:22.686 --> 34:23.641
Really?

34:23.770 --> 34:25.761
Yes, Fargo.
Now, suck it up.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.563
You're so intelligent
and intuitive.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.019
People don't give
you enough credit.

34:31.278 --> 34:32.984
What are you talking about?

34:33.113 --> 34:35.900
You never made me
forget how much smarter
you were than me.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.399
Shh. No. I love you
just the way you are.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.661
If you say,
"I complete you",
I may hurl.

34:42.872 --> 34:45.909
Jo, if he's a hallucination,
whatever he's saying
is coming from you.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.826
From me? Okay,
this stuff is straight
out of a romance novel.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.044
This is nothing like
how he really was.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.372
How we really were.

34:55.468 --> 34:57.424
Well, he's not
going anywhere until
you figure it out.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.169
So, I hope you do.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.718
CARTER: How is that possible,
it's all around us?

35:06.855 --> 35:08.516
Quartz. lt's amplifying
the signal.

35:08.648 --> 35:09.683
It could be coming
from anywhere.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.556
Oh, fantastic.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.979
I think it's time to
talk about our feelings.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.353
I'll go first.
Please don't.

35:17.907 --> 35:18.862
Carter, he's not
really there.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.189
Yeah.
(CHUCKLING)

35:21.703 --> 35:23.819
I'm just going to
go over here.

35:24.873 --> 35:25.988
Come on, Carter,
come take a load off.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.874
He knows you're scared,
so why can't you
admit it to yourself?

35:30.420 --> 35:31.751
STARK: Don't worry.
We'll figure it.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.040
Just another
day in Eureka.

35:36.009 --> 35:36.794
(EXCLAIMS)

35:36.926 --> 35:37.881
(GROANING)

35:38.887 --> 35:39.876
Whoopsie.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.085
That was unexpected.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.387
They camouflaged it with
holographic projection.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.677
Whoever is doing this
has thought of everything.

35:48.021 --> 35:48.976
Carter, what are
you doing?

35:49.230 --> 35:50.219
Turning it off.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.225
Did I scare it?

35:56.529 --> 35:57.518
Yeah, Carter,
you scared it.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.898
It must be remote—activated,
but ifthe goal is to
take out G.D.,

36:01.034 --> 36:03.070
why turn it off before
the thing does its job?

36:03.787 --> 36:04.742
Maybe it's done its job.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.736
No, ifthe DED device
went off, we'd know it.

36:06.873 --> 36:07.988
No, no, no, maybe it
wasn't intended to go off.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.034
Maybe that was the plan.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.532
Oh, I had
a plan once.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.000
We're in the
middle of nowhere.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.494
Bridge...

36:16.216 --> 36:17.205
This was all a
distraction.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.966
Somebody wanted us
to move the DED
out of Global.

36:26.893 --> 36:27.882
CARTER: (ON PHONE)
Jo, where's the weapon?

36:28.019 --> 36:29.930
Carter, there was an ambush.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.230
The weapon's gone.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.610
Yeah, well, destroying G.D.
was never the plan.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.992
They wanted us to
get the weapon out of here
so they could steal it.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.706
But the big question
is who are they?

36:52.001 --> 36:53.502
CARTER: Whoever they are,
they had help.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.662
I mean, they've been
10 steps ahead of us
the entire time.

36:57.632 --> 36:58.792
They have an
inside man.

36:59.134 --> 37:01.045
Wait a minute,
I recognize these
design specs.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.718
l was going through
old funding requests
from other Fargo's tenure,

37:03.847 --> 37:05.963
and I could swear
I remember seeing
something like this.

37:06.766 --> 37:07.755
That could be our guy.

37:07.892 --> 37:08.881
Find him.
Okay.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.640
Come on.
Where are you?

37:20.947 --> 37:23.609
If you're looking for
a back door out of here,
you're not going to find one.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.159
You're responsible for this.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.650
You ignored my advice...

37:27.579 --> 37:29.285
You put the DED
on that truck.

37:29.414 --> 37:30.369
Booya.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.908
Watch your tone,
Director,

37:32.167 --> 37:34.032
I gave you this job
and I can take it away.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.038
VVeH,lguess
it's a good thing I
already filed my report

37:36.171 --> 37:38.002
with the Department of
Defense, isn't it?

37:39.424 --> 37:40.539
Is there anything else,
General?

37:43.845 --> 37:45.961
(LAUGHING)
Who's looking for the
back door now?

37:46.389 --> 37:47.378
(SCOFFING)

37:48.767 --> 37:49.756
How do you feel?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.057
Considering I'm
about to lose my job?

37:52.729 --> 37:53.718
Not too bad.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.349
Then my work
here is done.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.485
Oh, this isn't good.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.862
Okay, things don'tjust
disappear into thin air.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.778
Extend the perimeter
and keep me updated.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.536
Will you stop doing that?

38:12.665 --> 38:15.407
Doing what?
I just need to talk
to you about something.

38:15.543 --> 38:16.703
Oh, what is it now?
You want to tell me

38:16.836 --> 38:18.747
how nice my ass looks
when I'm holding a gun?

38:19.214 --> 38:21.079
Well, I mean, you
do have a nice ass.
Okay.

38:22.842 --> 38:23.831
You want to have it out?

38:24.803 --> 38:25.792
Okay.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.347
The truth is l have been

38:28.640 --> 38:32.224
romanticizing
our relationship
this entire time.

38:32.352 --> 38:36.595
You know, there
was a reason I hesitated,
and now I know what it is.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.720
What are you talking about?

38:37.941 --> 38:39.932
You and l,
we don't fit.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.308
So, I'm over it.

38:43.071 --> 38:44.060
I'm over us.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.072
If you want to
hang out with Zoe,

38:49.744 --> 38:51.780
go ahead.
I'm done.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.994
What are you doing with
my grandmother's ring, Jo?

39:00.004 --> 39:04.043
What's going on?
Hey, Jo, sorry
for interrupting.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.166
Zane, I'm going
to have to take
you in for questioning.

39:06.845 --> 39:07.800
For what?

39:07.929 --> 39:11.467
Potential collusion in the
theft of the DED
Sorry, Jo. You done?

39:12.100 --> 39:14.887
No, I did...
Okay, you need
to look at this.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.509
Come on.
Fine.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.522
I'm telling you, Carter,
it wasn't me.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.860
ZOE: Zane would never
do something like that.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.198
Honey, they were
his designs.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.828
Between that and
the security code,

39:32.954 --> 39:34.660
the evidence was
ovenNhelming.

39:34.789 --> 39:35.778
I don't care.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.866
Congratulations,
you got what you wanted.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.867
(STAMMERING)
I... Get what I...
What? Zane?

39:41.170 --> 39:42.546
Honey, just give her
herspace.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.334
I've been interrogating
Zane for an hour,
I think she has a point.

39:45.925 --> 39:49.133
I mean, he's a hacker,
but black market weapons,
that's not his thing.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.010
Well, what, do you
think he was set up?

39:51.973 --> 39:53.713
If I was going to choose
a fall guy, I can't think
of one better.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.841
Should I get her?
No, just...

39:57.979 --> 40:00.015
Hey, we'll figure it out.
Come on. Sit down.

40:02.859 --> 40:05.191
Okay.
It's all right.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.644
STARK: What are we doing?
Dinner? Movie?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.862
Maybe a quiet night in?
No.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.363
Is that a no
to the movie?

40:11.492 --> 40:12.481
We're not doing this
right now.

40:12.827 --> 40:16.035
You've been not
doing it for four years.
Isn't that why we're here?

40:17.123 --> 40:18.909
I think we need
to talk about something.

40:19.792 --> 40:20.781
That a girl.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.283
Okay.

40:22.629 --> 40:23.618
I'm scared.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.248
I'm just really scared.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.873
You're scared...

40:28.509 --> 40:29.794
What? About us?

40:29.928 --> 40:30.917
About...

40:31.387 --> 40:34.595
I'm not afraid about
us starting something,
I'm just...

40:35.767 --> 40:37.428
I'm afraid of how it'll end.

40:39.854 --> 40:40.843
Like with Nathan.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.136
Oh. You mean...

40:43.441 --> 40:44.396
End.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.514
Yeah, she said "end."

40:45.693 --> 40:47.274
Well, I'm going
to live forever.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.356
Just so you know.

40:49.822 --> 40:50.811
It's, uh...

40:51.366 --> 40:52.355
But I get it.

40:54.661 --> 40:55.650
I do.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.444
lguess
the question is

40:58.665 --> 41:01.657
are you too scared
to miss out on us?

41:04.754 --> 41:06.870
Well said. Your turn.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.966
I'm good.

41:09.384 --> 41:10.749
Is there something else
you wanted to say?

41:12.512 --> 41:15.094
No. I...
Yes, there's...

41:17.350 --> 41:19.215
As long as
we're sharing,

41:20.645 --> 41:21.885
I'm head over heels
in love with you

41:24.315 --> 41:25.930
and l have been
since the day we met.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.182
About time.

41:29.529 --> 41:30.518
No kidding.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.229
Okay?

41:33.992 --> 41:34.981
Okay.

41:51.926 --> 41:52.915
She's gone.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.084
He's gone too.

41:55.847 --> 41:56.836
You want to grab
some dinner?

41:58.016 --> 41:59.005
Hmm.

42:02.270 --> 42:03.259
No.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.642
lwas, um, thinking...

42:10.737 --> 42:11.726
Maybe breakfast?

42:16.284 --> 42:17.319
Okay.

42:18.661 --> 42:19.650
Wow.

42:20.246 --> 42:21.235
Nice.

42:26.586 --> 42:27.826
You used me.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.668
Almost blew me to
kingdom come in the process.

42:29.839 --> 42:32.125
Why didn't you tell me
taking the weapon was
part of the plan all along?

42:32.258 --> 42:33.998
You had no intention
of destroying it.

42:34.135 --> 42:37.298
There are some aspects
of the plan we didn't share.

42:37.430 --> 42:40.342
Plausible deniability,
Dr. Grant,
that was your mantra.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.800
Why did you do it?
What, for the money?

42:43.936 --> 42:47.394
We have no interest in the
weapon or its monetary value.

42:48.191 --> 42:50.182
We needed it
for its power source.

42:50.610 --> 42:51.599
I don't understand.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.810
There's something
I need to show you.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.155
What is all this?

42:58.284 --> 43:00.149
We've rebuilt
the bridge device.

43:00.578 --> 43:04.821
This is a chance for you
to do what you intended
to do 63 years ago.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.532
Change the world.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.918
We're sending you home.
