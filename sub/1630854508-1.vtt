WEBVTT

00:16.080 --> 00:20.160
We were a 100% focused
to win a gold medal.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.760
We’ve been working as a team
for four years for this.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.360
We were at the best
level that we’ve ever had.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.480
I was getting a good rhythm
going you know, doing what I loved.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.040
We were in it to fight for a medal.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.200
It was kind of a big shock.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.600
We had no idea what was coming at us.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.160
Everyone was just
grabbing hurdles and twist balls,

00:58.320 --> 01:00.920
weights, everything
to try and do it at home.

01:01.080 --> 01:06.040
We have to suddenly go back
to Argentina and start this lockdown.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.680
That moment
was life changing for all of us.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.480
We cannot plan a year ahead.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.680
All of a sudden
you’re like I’m useless.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.840
I think everyone thought:
"Okay, 15 days".

01:24.680 --> 01:27.960
<i>...case numbers
continue to rise.</i>

01:34.000 --> 01:35.520
It is a long way to Tokyo.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.760
Covid changed everything,
suddenly the calendar just dropped,

02:03.920 --> 02:07.000
all the competitions
completely stopped.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.080
It was scary,

02:10.040 --> 02:15.120
but actually it gave me this time
that I hadn’t had.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.440
An extra year
for me to fully be at a 100%.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.520
I just have to be super super
careful now, you can’t rush that.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.360
I tore my tendon in 2019.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.160
I can’t pull my leg up on to bed.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.200
They put it back together,
put loads of metal stuff around it,

02:38.360 --> 02:40.200
put some nails in my knee.

02:40.360 --> 02:44.840
I couldn’t walk for 6 weeks,
then I couldn’t run for 6 months.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.120
I had the whole of 2019 out,
so I hadn’t competed in 2 years.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.000
So this is a really
significant year for me.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.496
We'll figure how you’re gonna
start the run to begin with.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.360
Think about your setup for
when you start, okay?

03:05.960 --> 03:08.120
We want everything
to be out in front, okay.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.520
Ok, Niamh, in your own time.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.536
I couldn’t run properly
I don’t know why.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.760
You’ve spent so much time riding on a
bike and being on an elliptical.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.160
When you’re ready

03:39.440 --> 03:42.200
I was 8 years old
when I got into athletics.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.520
Come on, Niamh.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.640
I started jogging, doing 800
meters, then did heptathlon.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.600
Heptathlon is the ultimate sport,

03:54.760 --> 03:58.320
you’ve got to be fast, you’ve got to
be able to run distance,

03:58.480 --> 04:00.760
you’ve got to throw, jump,
you’ve got to do everything.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.880
<i>The World Junior
Champion in the Heptathlon outdoors.</i>

04:04.040 --> 04:05.880
<i>The Commonwealth Bronze Medalist.</i>

04:06.040 --> 04:08.000
Ultimately,
what I'm thriving to achieve

04:08.160 --> 04:09.680
is to be the best in the world.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.240
It's everybody's goal, really,
in sports, I think.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.160
I could keep running all day
but not technically well.

04:23.320 --> 04:27.240
So, on the last one I found it really
hard to actually run properly,

04:27.400 --> 04:29.456
You just try and push your hips
a little bit further forward.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.200
I still think
I’m running quite like this.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.240
You are a little bit...

04:33.400 --> 04:34.816
But I wouldn’t
get too worried about that,

04:34.840 --> 04:37.040
again, you’ve got plenty of
time to tweak these things

04:37.200 --> 04:40.000
The last time I properly
competed was 2018.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.160
I was just quite young
compared to now,

04:42.320 --> 04:45.000
I think in every sense,
in everything I was doing,

04:45.160 --> 04:48.840
and I feel a lot more...
I know what I’m doing a bit more now.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.360
I just have to do it.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.440
Had your timeline,
gone ahead last year.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.280
- It's been hard.
- It was a blessing in disguise.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.920
Massive, massive blessing.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.480
<i>...professional athletes
across the globe are having to adapt</i>

05:13.640 --> 05:16.520
<i>their training schedules
in the most unprecedented ways...</i>

05:16.680 --> 05:19.560
<i>Sports stars like most of us
are adjusting</i>

05:19.720 --> 05:21.560
<i>to a very different way of life.</i>

05:21.720 --> 05:23.256
When I read the news for
the first time on Twitter,

05:23.280 --> 05:25.280
that’s when it actually became real.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.840
Crazy, crazy, crazy...

05:28.000 --> 05:29.200
It was pretty tough.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.600
I am complete at home,

05:32.520 --> 05:36.320
which is, I mean, in a way, nice.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.920
It's hard to figure out what to do,
what's the next step.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.560
That's your job, that's your life,
that's your livelihood.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.040
So, I just basically train here,
in the backyard.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.640
Welcome to training session,
courtyard edition.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.480
This is the time you learn
a lot about who you are

06:00.640 --> 06:02.720
and what you’re capable of doing.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.480
Don’t get down, get up,
and keep it moving.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.280
I’m out of here,

06:21.440 --> 06:24.880
my only session here on the track,
warming up a little bit.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.720
It's just me out here.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.520
And I love it, it's like meditation.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.720
The moment the pandemic hit
was life changing.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.736
Everything that’s normal for you
is out the window, right?

06:55.760 --> 06:59.080
No gym, no fencing, no coaches,
no nothing. That’s scary, right?

06:59.240 --> 07:02.080
Not being able to control
what you normally can control.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.160
So it's like you’ve gotta
take a deep breath and do like...

07:05.800 --> 07:07.336
Everybody’s dealing with this too,
all right?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.400
We’re all trying to
figure this shit out on our own.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.000
When I put on a mask, right,
I feel like a super hero.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.000
It's just the best feeling ever.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.760
I can have the worst day

07:20.480 --> 07:22.960
and I just put the mask on
and that’s the best day in my life.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.320
This is what I wake up
in the morning to do

07:26.480 --> 07:28.680
and when it's taken away from you,
it's tough.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.120
I am two-time World Champion.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.360
<i>First American to have won</i>

07:36.520 --> 07:38.080
<i>the Individual World Championships.</i>

07:38.240 --> 07:39.240
Doing what I love

07:39.400 --> 07:40.896
is probably one of the greatest
feelings in the world.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.880
<i>Yes, he is
a very successful model.</i>

07:43.040 --> 07:44.240
Thank you.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.920
Wonderful attack.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.960
Being the first ever
world champion for the USA,

07:50.120 --> 07:51.320
that was when my life changed.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.880
There it is, beautiful.

07:54.040 --> 07:59.480
<i>America has its first ever
Men’s Foil World Champion.</i>

08:00.640 --> 08:03.320
I literally cannot wait 'cause
I haven’t touched my potential,

08:03.920 --> 08:07.080
and I know that, and I feel that,
I can picture myself on the podium.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.736
Wait, what are you doing today?
It's so nice out, what you doing?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.200
I know you’re doing something,
you’re so cool.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.600
I don’t know.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.120
Yo, where you at?

08:34.400 --> 08:35.400
All right.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.320
He’s in the valley.
He’s just there and I’m just here.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.800
I can’t sit still, that’s my problem,
I should be able to chill,

08:47.960 --> 08:49.320
but I can’t do that.

08:49.480 --> 08:52.480
I just wanna fence.
I am just getting started,

08:52.640 --> 08:54.176
I’m just touching
the surface of what I can do.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.320
It just feels so ready
to just get out there and fence,

08:58.480 --> 09:00.800
and that’s really what I wanna do,

09:00.960 --> 09:02.840
just compete,
that’s what I love to do the most.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.360
But obviously we can’t do anything
so...

09:08.280 --> 09:11.080
It's kind of madness
because nobody knows anything.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.200
So all you can really do is
stay positive, or you’ll go nuts.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.720
What a view.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.040
Peaceful up here.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.040
I'm just trying to call my coach.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.680
See if he’s up.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.200
Come on, Jay.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.480
Pick up.

10:17.840 --> 10:22.120
You realise how much you miss
something when you can’t have it,

10:24.600 --> 10:29.520
It's really odd.
Time, not having a schedule.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.760
Not knowing when
the next competition’s gonna be.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.320
You know, the uncertain
is terrifying, right?

10:39.320 --> 10:41.800
<i>Well, sports
competitions are now being cancelled,</i>

10:41.920 --> 10:44.960
<i>rather than simply postponed.</i>

10:45.120 --> 10:46.760
<i>With the crisis escalating,</i>

10:46.920 --> 10:49.640
<i>there are fears about the safety
of stadium events.</i>

10:49.800 --> 10:51.560
<i>No one knows
how long it will be</i>

10:51.640 --> 10:54.840
<i>before sports venues
can welcome fans back in again.</i>

11:13.040 --> 11:14.760
So Malaysia is gonna be cancelled.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.960
That means Singapore is gonna be
cancelled.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.680
Strange, confusing, upsetting.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.320
It's insane.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.360
A lot of people are not...

11:32.560 --> 11:36.920
Don’t know how to move or know how
to be when things are uncertain.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.880
Covid cancelling so much
and postponing so much,

11:42.040 --> 11:44.520
I guess you can’t
think about that every day,

11:44.680 --> 11:47.160
you know, the what ifs, you’ve gotta
stay in the present moment

11:47.280 --> 11:50.000
and just,
you know, stay focused on your goals.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.520
You're only allowed to ride
within 5 miles of your house,

12:13.680 --> 12:19.240
but luckily, that includes
some pretty incredible places

12:31.000 --> 12:33.520
I thought we were married.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.400
I think we have like
this special connection.

12:40.120 --> 12:44.840
You know, when we play volleyball
we’re forced to marry each other.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.840
We...

12:48.000 --> 12:52.240
We travel around so much that I think
we have more time with each other

12:52.400 --> 12:56.160
than we will ever have
with our girlfriends.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.840
So, that's the way it is.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.440
- Don't you feel the same?
- Yeah.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.200
Chris is my best friend, my partner.

13:30.160 --> 13:35.480
He’s like ice-cold, super sharp.
I have more the physique.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.000
The chemistry that we have together.
I think that’s really special

13:45.920 --> 13:48.880
When I was in the third grade here,
he was in his first.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.640
It's hard to think that that’s
the same guy I’m playing with now,

13:52.800 --> 13:55.720
because he was
such a skinny little boy.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.360
He liked volleyball,
that was for sure.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.760
I didn’t think that he would be
as good as he is today.

14:07.960 --> 14:12.920
<i>And there it is,
Norway with a spectacular victory.</i>

14:13.080 --> 14:16.160
<i>Anders Bernstein Mol,
arguably the best blocker</i>

14:16.320 --> 14:19.080
<i>that beach volleyball has ever seen.</i>

14:19.240 --> 14:21.680
<i>Christian Soren
the best defender on tour.</i>

14:21.840 --> 14:25.880
<i>Mission accomplished.
The world’s number one team.</i>

14:26.040 --> 14:27.400
We won!

14:28.160 --> 14:29.800
We want more.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.520
<i>Can anybody stop Norway?</i>

14:33.080 --> 14:37.080
We were at the best level
that we’ve ever had.

14:37.240 --> 14:41.760
We won the 2018 season,
we won the 2019 season

14:54.440 --> 14:57.960
I moved back home.
This is where I’ve been staying

14:58.120 --> 15:00.120
since this corona pandemic.

15:00.280 --> 15:04.800
Normally we’re out and about and
travelling and living in a suitcase.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.560
Now I’ve actually been spending
a lot more time here in this room

15:08.720 --> 15:12.000
than I would ever want to.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.800
It's been a little difficult to
actually be forced to slow down.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.600
I can’t enjoy it because
I feel like I’m wasting my time.

15:34.320 --> 15:38.000
We were ready to play,
fighting for some medals

15:38.600 --> 15:41.880
We have a lot of confidence.
We were really on a good flow.

15:42.520 --> 15:46.880
The plan is to walk up here
to the top,

15:47.920 --> 15:51.040
- bring these boards and...
- Race.

15:51.200 --> 15:57.200
We were so excited to like finally do
it in 2020 but now we have to reset.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.520
It's boring just to sit around
and not do anything,

16:00.680 --> 16:02.760
so we try to always
try some stuff to do.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.000
We like to compete,
so it's important to win.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.840
What's the meaning of doing this
without competing?

16:21.240 --> 16:22.360
Oh, no.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.360
We were 100% focused in all respects

16:51.040 --> 16:54.000
and suddenly 1 more year to go.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.520
It's hard but...

16:59.600 --> 17:00.920
my fight is on.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.720
Quitting was not on the table.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.160
We, as a team, started thinking:

17:09.320 --> 17:13.480
"From now on, we just have to
keep going, doing our best,

17:14.480 --> 17:15.720
until the end."

17:16.760 --> 17:18.800
<i>Legendary duo
Santiago Lange</i>

17:18.960 --> 17:22.440
<i>and Cecilia Saroli
current reigning gold medalists</i>

17:22.600 --> 17:26.240
<i>with an impressive
8 Olympic campaigns between them.</i>

17:26.400 --> 17:29.120
We go together.
It's the coolest thing ever.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.160
<i>All the money is
to be made on the Argentinians.</i>

17:32.320 --> 17:34.920
Santi is the one steering
and driving

17:35.080 --> 17:37.440
and I am the one accelerating.

17:38.560 --> 17:42.080
It's really important,
the coordination between us.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.320
2016 wouldn’t
have happened without Ceci.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.560
I know that very well.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.960
Ah, very strange,
we all know about this lake,

17:59.120 --> 18:00.240
anything could happen,

18:00.400 --> 18:02.920
so we have to be open minded
for everything.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.920
I'm just hoping we can race.

18:06.760 --> 18:10.360
Since the pandemic started,
we've been training alone.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.960
Now finally coming here,
getting to race, it feels great.

18:28.200 --> 18:34.000
Racing is a special thing.
You just have to dance.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.920
<i>Argentina leading
the Nacras</i>

18:38.080 --> 18:40.040
<i>as the reigning Olympic Champions.</i>

18:40.760 --> 18:42.320
<i>Now it's getting busy round the bar.</i>

18:44.480 --> 18:46.040
<i>There's the Swiss boat.</i>

18:49.400 --> 18:52.040
<i>Argentina are going to capsize.</i>

18:52.200 --> 18:55.360
<i>Are they going to save it?
They just about saved it.</i>

19:01.200 --> 19:04.800
We didn't have the speed,
so not very happy.

19:06.680 --> 19:10.400
You always want to sail
in the level that you think you are

19:10.560 --> 19:14.520
and when you can't, it's horrible

19:14.680 --> 19:16.960
but it's part of the game.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.520
Problems.

19:22.200 --> 19:28.120
<i>And winner of the Europeans 2020,</i>

19:28.880 --> 19:30.680
<i>Italy 26.</i>

19:47.440 --> 19:50.000
I think I need to work on
a lot in my tiredness,

19:50.160 --> 19:55.240
maybe it's not that conscious
that we perform worse

19:55.400 --> 19:57.000
at the end of the regatta,

19:57.160 --> 20:00.480
some mistakes that I shouldn't
have done

20:00.640 --> 20:02.280
and maybe I was tired.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.760
Now we have one year. One more year

20:05.920 --> 20:11.320
to prepare ourselves
and try to choose the best option

20:12.320 --> 20:15.640
between the little options
that the covid give us.

20:15.800 --> 20:20.080
It's a lot of work to be done and now
it's time to keep pushing hard.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.280
The extra year is a big deal.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.920
It's like you're running a marathon

20:29.520 --> 20:31.880
and when you are about to finish,

20:32.760 --> 20:37.160
they suddenly tell you: "OK, you have
to run 20 more kilometers".

20:42.640 --> 20:44.120
I'm talking with my lady.

20:45.840 --> 20:51.680
She sometime stays at night
watching my racing.

21:15.880 --> 21:20.800
I normally can go back home
frequently, but now with Covid,

21:22.800 --> 21:24.280
that's not an option, so...

21:25.800 --> 21:27.240
Will you wait for me?

21:41.360 --> 21:43.400
I have to go.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.120
We need to pack.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.880
<i>In what was turning out
to be a year like no other,</i>

21:54.040 --> 21:56.160
<i>millions are now working from home.</i>

21:58.800 --> 21:59.960
Come on, papa.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.456
<i>While some people
are spending</i>

22:01.480 --> 22:03.200
<i>more time together than ever
before...</i>

22:03.360 --> 22:05.600
<i>What impact is
this new work life balance</i>

22:05.760 --> 22:07.120
<i>having on elite athletes?</i>

22:11.680 --> 22:14.120
I'm riding my bike again

22:14.280 --> 22:16.400
- How was the practice today?
- I won.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.480
You won? I tell you how was the
practice not the match.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.320
My butt?

22:48.400 --> 22:51.160
I feel like having that
positive support,

22:51.320 --> 22:53.520
having someone who believes in you,

22:53.680 --> 22:56.760
that you can learn and get better.
That's important.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.360
Yes, yes, yes.
Man, that's the family y'all.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.760
- That's my mum.
- Hi!

23:03.920 --> 23:05.960
- What's up, man?
- What is going on there?

23:06.120 --> 23:09.000
Yeah, it's gonna be a good day today,
I can already feel it.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.560
You know, I love my parents
and they're my coaches also,

23:12.720 --> 23:17.480
so, you know, it's a good way
of staying on top of the training.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.880
Living in lockdown with mum and dad,

23:20.040 --> 23:22.680
is not something
I'd expect to be doing again.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.360
It feels like I'm in high school
again.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.280
I'm gonna get ready for training.

24:04.440 --> 24:07.680
It's been a while since I've been
able to fence so it feels so good,

24:07.840 --> 24:09.440
this is a smile you can't buy.

24:09.600 --> 24:14.000
When you walk into the gym,
and this is the best.

24:14.560 --> 24:19.080
Just gonna pack my bag,
gonna look for my shoes, oh shoot.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.080
I better have shoes here.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.800
Got a mask,
please let me have shoes in here.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.040
Wow, well here's fencing stuff.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.880
Yes!

24:35.880 --> 24:38.320
We're going to go blue today, yes.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.720
I'm very lucky I have a lot of foils.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.360
The other part is picking which ones
I wanna destroy people with today.

24:46.640 --> 24:49.040
I normally fence
six times a week at least,

24:49.200 --> 24:52.080
so it's really been weird not
waking up with a regime.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.480
I don’t like that.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.080
People who know me
know I'm the most ADHD, like,

24:56.240 --> 25:00.320
constant sort of person,
so my mind is races like anything.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.760
Having ADHD is like you just have
a different way of thinking, right?

25:06.920 --> 25:09.960
But if I wasn't ADHD,
I would never have become who I am.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.600
There we go.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.160
Game time.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.160
Wow!

25:43.280 --> 25:44.640
Wow!

25:45.720 --> 25:48.760
Being ADHD is like
everything under the sun.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.960
Finding fencing
is what changed my life.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.400
Woah!

25:53.720 --> 25:58.520
And it was an after school,
kind of help out kids

25:58.680 --> 26:02.640
who needed extra time,
and I was like: "I love this."

26:03.760 --> 26:05.040
Wow!

26:06.600 --> 26:08.520
That moment I was like "this is it,"

26:08.680 --> 26:10.680
I'm not doing anything else
with my life.

26:13.680 --> 26:14.680
It's good.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.120
Lot of things to work on,
well done, very happy.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.000
See you, my man.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.921
I was a little bit nervous to see how
my endurance will be considering

26:23.040 --> 26:24.440
we went into it full force today,

26:25.120 --> 26:26.880
but heart still beating,
feeling fantastic,

26:27.040 --> 26:30.280
so it was a great first day,
I'm very pleased with myself, so.

26:30.920 --> 26:31.920
Success.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.760
Wow! What a day!

26:45.080 --> 26:46.080
<i>As of today,</i>

26:46.240 --> 26:49.040
<i>several countries are reopening
their borders.</i>

26:49.200 --> 26:51.320
<i>Some countries are
relaxing regulations</i>

26:51.480 --> 26:52.880
<i>after months of being in lockdown.</i>

26:53.040 --> 26:55.200
<i>For many athletes
this is a welcome return</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:56.880
<i>to their regular training programs.</i>

27:05.840 --> 27:08.160
I'm at the airport
about to fly to Sydney.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.760
We're doing a test run,
so it should be interesting.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.360
to finally get on the water.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.080
It's been an interesting
couple of months.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.080
I've had some big time
with my family,

27:18.240 --> 27:20.960
but at the same time,
I'm eagerly looking forward

27:21.120 --> 27:22.560
to getting back on court.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.880
Let's go.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.480
So I'm back.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.680
I've missed a lot of training.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.520
Yeah, back to work, man.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.040
Good, keep pushing.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.880
Hey, hey.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.280
- There's the tension, feel it?
- Yes.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.560
- Good, how does that feel?
- Good.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.040
Yeah, you feel that little bit?

28:23.200 --> 28:26.280
So we're just gonna feel that joint
and just override it.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.120
Good. You okay?

28:30.480 --> 28:31.520
Sorry about this.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.320
That's good then.

28:40.520 --> 28:44.680
I'll use that phrase, I am cautiously
optimistic, non-committal.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.200
No, I mean, her body is in a much
better place

28:47.360 --> 28:49.160
always round,
but there's still a ways to go.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.000
This next couple of weeks she's gonna
step up her training again

28:52.160 --> 28:54.200
and she has to step up
to the next level.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.720
Once she's transitioned through
to the level,

28:56.880 --> 29:00.680
then the chance of injury reduces
massively unless she's an idiot.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.440
So for Dubai,
now the training's moved up,

29:06.600 --> 29:08.560
staying ahead of the game
is critical,

29:08.720 --> 29:10.800
'cause we can't afford to
go backwards.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.720
So we've just checked in our bags,
and we're way over,

29:16.560 --> 29:18.960
but we managed to get through.
Woo-hoo!

29:32.080 --> 29:33.680
Landed in Dubai.

29:38.120 --> 29:41.040
Dubai is just so extra.
I think it's just madness,

29:41.200 --> 29:42.520
the skyline is crazy.

29:46.200 --> 29:50.080
We're training at NAS
which is a sporting center,

29:50.240 --> 29:52.360
and British Athletics
have rented it out.

29:53.120 --> 29:56.640
It's great to be in a really warm
climate, your muscles are warmer,

29:56.800 --> 29:59.320
you will recover quicker,
it benefits training a lot.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.000
I can't run. I can't do anything,

30:27.160 --> 30:31.560
because I strained my hamstring.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.920
It's quite frustrating
because I just keep getting injured.

30:50.440 --> 30:56.320
I was doing the hurdles session
and I felt my hamstring a tiny bit,

30:56.480 --> 30:59.200
like the tiniest little stretch
and I was like

31:00.160 --> 31:01.360
that feels weird,

31:01.520 --> 31:04.640
but I carried on hurdling and, like,
running and didn't tell David.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.680
I had my scan and
it was a 15 centimeter tear.

31:09.640 --> 31:13.560
And 15 centimeters is a lot like,
nearly my whole hamstring.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.080
I didn't stop when I first felt it
which is so annoying

31:18.240 --> 31:19.696
because it could have been
a 3-day thing.

31:19.720 --> 31:25.320
It's just because I'm so desperate
to get 3 weeks of training done.

32:18.840 --> 32:22.480
It's easy to have the role
as a coach than a father.

32:23.200 --> 32:28.720
You are always a coach
so to have time to be a father is,

32:28.880 --> 32:32.640
is not the first ah, or not so easy

32:32.800 --> 32:37.120
to prioritize this, so...

32:38.880 --> 32:42.880
That's why we have mum,
so she can be the mum for us.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.320
Yeah, yeah.

32:44.480 --> 32:47.720
She can bring some female values.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.760
I think it's important.

32:49.920 --> 32:55.120
So what you say that
ah, I'm a bad dad and an okay coach,

32:55.280 --> 32:58.280
but to coach your kids is hard

32:58.440 --> 33:01.360
because your kids,
if they don't perform,

33:01.520 --> 33:04.160
then you have to...

33:07.120 --> 33:08.760
I don't look forward to

33:08.920 --> 33:12.280
when I'm gonna kick them out of the
team for instance.

33:26.960 --> 33:30.560
So, I have a problem with my hip.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.400
I have small, like, micro fractures
in both my legs.

33:39.640 --> 33:44.200
It's like overuse injury so it's...
it's gotten worse over time.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.840
My bone is kind of eating itself up

33:50.320 --> 33:53.200
and the doctor is, like,
scratching their head,

33:53.360 --> 33:56.560
because they didn't know what it was
and they've never seen

33:57.600 --> 33:59.080
a stretcher like this before.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.320
I'm not in the group anymore,
it's not so cool.

34:18.720 --> 34:21.360
The future looks like
kind of unknown.

34:22.800 --> 34:27.640
The worse-case scenario, we will not
be able to qualify for the Games.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.400
That will be really sad,

34:30.560 --> 34:34.920
it's been our goal
since we were small kids.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.800
It's really difficult to
be trouble

34:37.960 --> 34:40.760
because you are depending so much
on the other guy.

34:41.640 --> 34:44.320
It's like the worst nightmare
I think.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.920
We have decided not to have Anders
in the tournament.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.600
We just want to...

36:40.320 --> 36:45.160
have him a 100% without injuries,
and...

36:47.200 --> 36:48.560
Svein is coming in,

36:49.080 --> 36:52.040
Christian will play this tournament
without Anders.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.760
It was a big disappointment.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.440
It's hard for me to sit here
and see this game

37:04.920 --> 37:07.000
because I'm, I'm going crazy.

37:20.600 --> 37:24.880
Of course it will not be the same
not having Anders on the court.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.160
Me and Svein we will do our best

37:28.320 --> 37:31.400
but we will not be able
to play on the same level

37:31.560 --> 37:34.440
and it's kind of sad.

37:36.800 --> 37:39.800
We just have to do
the best we can right now.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.816
<i>As more and more travel
corridors continue to open up</i>

38:13.840 --> 38:16.120
<i>people are realizing that
moving around the world</i>

38:16.280 --> 38:19.800
<i>is not what it used to be.</i>

38:19.960 --> 38:23.320
<i>Long periods of quarantine and
regular Covid tests are now the norm</i>

38:25.600 --> 38:30.560
Strange, it's so strange,
oh my God.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.280
Look at these infectious linen.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.360
Biohazard waste.

38:37.200 --> 38:42.040
I just got done with my
Covid antigen test.

38:43.200 --> 38:47.480
I'm supposed to be in the room
for the next 2 days at least,

38:47.640 --> 38:50.000
minimum, until we get the results.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.360
At the end of the day,

38:52.520 --> 38:55.120
I guess this is how things are gonna
be for a while.

39:01.600 --> 39:05.160
As far as this new norm,
I feel like I'm adapting to it.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.920
I feel like, you know,
we have no choice.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.200
We just cannot fly back
to our country.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.360
If it hadn't been for the
pandemic,

39:54.520 --> 39:58.520
I would have gone back to Argentina,
but now we just can't.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.120
We have to do our quarantine there
and then a quarantine here in Europe

40:03.280 --> 40:07.480
and that means that,
30 days without sailing.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.320
We cannot stop sailing for a month.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.160
This is typical Ceci, you know,

40:34.320 --> 40:37.160
she brings stuff that I always load

40:38.080 --> 40:40.440
and she never puts everything
together, you know.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.840
There's always things coming late
that should be at the beginning.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.360
That's typical Ceci.

40:45.520 --> 40:49.160
You know, when you work with a person
that is really anxious

40:50.000 --> 40:53.880
and he wants to start loading
before everything is ready...

40:54.040 --> 40:56.200
No, no, no, I, no, that's not true.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.920
I ask
bring me all the stuff that I load.

40:59.640 --> 41:03.240
Everything is ready,
then when I am finishing loading

41:03.400 --> 41:05.640
they bring 3 bags and a bicycle.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.240
For example.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.640
Every time the same, not a single.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.480
It's impossible to work
with these little kids.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.280
We are not going through
an easy moment now,

41:25.440 --> 41:29.160
relationship, communication,
everything is difficult.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.640
It's hard, yes.

41:51.640 --> 41:55.120
We were expecting
the container from Japan

41:55.800 --> 41:58.520
and our next training block
is in Sicily

41:58.680 --> 42:04.120
and unfortunately in the Customs,
the container got on hold.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.120
It's all related to the Covid,

42:06.280 --> 42:10.720
this all, this equipment was in Japan
for nothing, for 4 months there.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.320
Facing this

42:13.480 --> 42:15.680
problem and this big thing,

42:17.880 --> 42:19.520
it will make us stronger,

42:19.680 --> 42:24.160
I feel we are coming back in a better
shape

42:24.320 --> 42:26.920
than we were before the Covid.

42:27.880 --> 42:33.360
I heard that answer from you before,
but I disagree, well, personally,

42:34.680 --> 42:39.080
in my case, I agree with Ceci,
we are getting better which is a...

42:39.240 --> 42:41.800
As a team, you know,
I feel as a team.

42:41.960 --> 42:47.520
100% we are getting better
but I was so confident about our plan

42:47.680 --> 42:50.920
that I would have picked the games to
be in time.

43:05.480 --> 43:08.960
Now I have been away from home
for many months,

43:09.840 --> 43:12.720
you have a little bit of time
to think

43:12.880 --> 43:18.040
and you realize you miss a little bit
your house, your home, your people.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.560
Let's talk

43:26.960 --> 43:31.600
There are some days of the campaign
that you feel a little bit...

43:32.600 --> 43:34.800
that you need your family, yeah.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.960
Like, we are here right now talking
because...

43:42.160 --> 43:44.000
of this one extra year

43:44.160 --> 43:46.680
and if it was not

43:48.720 --> 43:50.800
because of this one extra year

43:52.360 --> 43:57.400
Mica and I had beautiful
personal plans together.

43:58.720 --> 44:03.640
Suddenly, I disappear for 6 months

44:04.720 --> 44:07.480
so it's a little bit hard, but...

44:09.040 --> 44:10.920
I think we are doing a great job.

44:11.960 --> 44:13.640
We are trying to...

44:15.000 --> 44:18.880
yeah, to accept the reality and...

44:20.800 --> 44:23.720
we are trying to do our best
to be okay.

44:27.360 --> 44:30.800
Of course an athlete I will always
be, I love doing sports,

44:30.960 --> 44:33.640
like I would love to continue,
I would love to.

44:35.040 --> 44:38.680
But we will also love to be mothers.

44:40.840 --> 44:44.200
Our sport takes a lot of time

44:46.640 --> 44:50.840
I'm always trying to think
I should find a way of doing it

44:51.360 --> 44:54.320
but still have time

44:54.480 --> 44:58.200
to be a mum and to have a family.

45:00.360 --> 45:04.720
I don't know if I am going to
find that, that way.

45:06.400 --> 45:10.680
I say you that I sometimes think
after this I will just

45:12.040 --> 45:16.120
put a coffee bar
and sleep in my house

45:16.280 --> 45:18.640
every day, I don't care,

45:18.800 --> 45:24.080
I will do whatever, but I want to be
with my family every day.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.640
And then I think,
what I am thinking is stupid.

45:37.480 --> 45:41.360
The idea of pushing hard
for one more year

45:41.520 --> 45:45.680
is unbelievable, difficult and hard.

45:47.280 --> 45:50.320
To not be with my sons more often.

45:51.720 --> 45:54.360
It's not that I want
to have my family apart,

45:54.520 --> 45:56.800
I wish I could do
both things together,

45:57.560 --> 46:01.720
but if we want to achieve our dream,
this is what it takes at this stage.

46:03.280 --> 46:08.360
You have to pay a price
if your dreams are to win a medal.

46:53.160 --> 46:56.080
Watching Christian and Svein
getting knocked out of the tournament

46:56.240 --> 46:58.920
was of course frustrating, and also

47:00.160 --> 47:02.360
disappointment, I was really hoping

47:02.520 --> 47:05.560
that my injury was gonna be over
and it's not.

47:08.440 --> 47:10.080
Injuries are shit always.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.360
You never want to have an injury,

47:12.520 --> 47:14.240
especially not the one that I have

47:14.400 --> 47:16.200
where you don't really know
when you get back.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.560
It's really, really frustrating.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.280
<i>Covid-19 continues
to impact sports</i>

47:23.440 --> 47:25.280
<i>in ways that you might not think.</i>

47:25.440 --> 47:28.080
<i>Doctors have seen a rise
in athletes getting injured.</i>

47:28.240 --> 47:30.120
<i>So many athletes
lost conditioning</i>

47:30.280 --> 47:31.880
<i>when Spring sports were cancelled,</i>

47:32.040 --> 47:34.080
<i>leaving them more or less sedentary
in lockdown,</i>

47:34.240 --> 47:37.840
<i>while others had been overtraining
suffering from...</i>

47:38.000 --> 47:41.120
<i>The Pandemic is
certainly a contributing factor...</i>

47:41.680 --> 47:43.520
I hurt my calf, mum.

47:44.880 --> 47:47.600
I just can't believe
it's happened again.

47:48.440 --> 47:51.000
Day 2 of concussion recovery,

47:51.160 --> 47:55.280
a little bit of a walk and
bought myself a sunflower.

47:55.440 --> 47:59.960
You have a bad ab.

48:01.120 --> 48:04.040
- Yep.
- Looks good from here though.

48:08.280 --> 48:12.320
I had an Achilles injury,
it's a serious situation.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.960
This extra year, it's not easy.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.880
You must always remember
the objective.

48:25.440 --> 48:30.040
I know the mind, so many emotions
can stop you, hinder you,

48:30.520 --> 48:34.320
deter you, I can't afford that,
I just can't.

48:43.840 --> 48:47.720
It takes a lot of mental strength
to be a great athlete.

48:50.600 --> 48:56.160
You're constantly torn between
crazy highs of competing

48:56.800 --> 49:01.400
and then super low lows of
when you're injured.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.520
You don't realize
how tough it actually is

49:04.680 --> 49:06.400
until you actually go through it.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.560
Sport can just be really
cruel sometimes.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.840
Ten seconds, yeah.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.680
I'll just have to do millions,
it's so big.

49:36.280 --> 49:38.840
If I didn't do this, obviously
I'd lose my muscle really quickly.

49:39.280 --> 49:42.120
So ah, it is a setback definitely,

49:42.280 --> 49:44.720
having gone backwards,
I will not go backwards.

49:45.200 --> 49:48.200
But I'm also
not necessarily going forwards.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.696
At this point in time,
yeah, we are little bit limited

49:52.720 --> 49:54.960
we can still throw to some degree,

49:55.120 --> 49:57.960
but anything involving running,
we are a little bit restricted.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.240
In terms of where we start
this summer season,

50:00.400 --> 50:04.240
we just have to knock that back
another 5 or 5 or 6 weeks or so.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.200
All right, physio.

50:14.280 --> 50:15.920
Relax.

50:22.400 --> 50:27.400
So we have to reign Niamh like

50:27.560 --> 50:30.160
in a really good way,
not a bad way, in a very good way,

50:30.320 --> 50:33.600
like she's the epitome of what
you want like she's eager to,

50:33.760 --> 50:35.336
to do the session,
she really wants to do it

50:35.360 --> 50:36.536
and she'll put all her effort
into it.

50:36.560 --> 50:40.120
It's the real fine balances of like
managing that,

50:40.280 --> 50:43.000
that will kind of make you the
champion that you're gonna be.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.440
Take up speed, final run.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.840
Giving up
is not an option for me.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.320
If you turn up fit on the day, great.

51:37.480 --> 51:39.560
- How long?
- 15 to go.

51:40.720 --> 51:44.520
If you turn up injured,
game over.

52:15.080 --> 52:17.160
I've come to Canada because

52:17.320 --> 52:19.520
America isn't
the best place right now.

52:20.120 --> 52:23.360
All the clubs have been closed,
the gyms been closed for a while

52:23.520 --> 52:27.400
and I figured I'd come out here
and train and kind of refocus.

52:28.920 --> 52:30.880
To be like mentally
and physically ready

52:31.040 --> 52:32.760
is the most important thing

52:33.520 --> 52:35.480
and when the time's ready,
I'll be ready.

52:41.440 --> 52:43.400
Hit the floor now.

52:45.120 --> 52:50.040
A year ago today, all these guys
were gearing up to go to a World Cup

52:50.200 --> 52:54.120
and a week before the World Cup,
they all get a letter or call saying

52:54.280 --> 52:57.240
cancel your trip,
we're all going into quarantine,

52:57.400 --> 52:59.040
the whole world shuts down.

52:59.200 --> 53:04.400
Athletes love routine, athletes hate
when there's a bump in the road,

53:04.960 --> 53:10.040
but if you can't handle here,
you're not gonna go very far.

53:26.280 --> 53:30.680
Miles, he's always 110%.

53:32.080 --> 53:35.120
Just look at him, like,
he's like, this is it.

53:35.280 --> 53:39.920
So everything that Miles does
is a coach's nightmare for kids,

53:40.080 --> 53:42.840
he's like, kids look up to him.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.680
He is like a, an idol,

53:44.840 --> 53:50.120
but everything he is doing,
you yell at your kids don't do that

53:54.600 --> 53:56.920
His strength and his weakness
is the same thing.

53:57.080 --> 53:58.440
It's his passion.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.080
And when you're way too crazy,

54:01.240 --> 54:04.960
it sometimes bites him
in the <i>derrière</i>,

54:05.120 --> 54:07.360
however, that's what makes him

54:07.520 --> 54:10.480
and once he knows when to turn it on
at the right time

54:10.640 --> 54:14.360
and usually that is every time,
he is unstoppable.

54:24.960 --> 54:28.240
I feel really good, I give him...
I attacked him a lot,

54:28.920 --> 54:30.640
some pointers.

54:31.600 --> 54:34.080
It's good sorting the kids out,
I love it.

54:34.760 --> 54:38.680
You can see how he is with kids,
he fancies a match,

54:38.840 --> 54:41.960
he's working on whatever
he needs to work on

54:42.120 --> 54:44.680
and right away
giving pointers to the kids.

54:44.840 --> 54:50.040
That is a testament to Miles,
he will give back to our community.

54:59.520 --> 55:03.800
I was mad little baby hooligan
as a kid.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.880
I got kicked out of
like every school.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.360
I was a pain in the ass.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.080
I was a cunt at school,
I didn't wanna learn what X was.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.880
I mean,
that's why fencing made me sit,

55:16.040 --> 55:17.576
if it wasn't,
if I didn't get in trouble

55:17.600 --> 55:20.680
I would never have found the sport
that got me out of trouble.

55:21.440 --> 55:24.360
So if I see a kid that wants,
you know, a picture

55:24.520 --> 55:26.376
or wants to talk to me about fencing
or whatever it might be,

55:26.400 --> 55:27.960
I always do my best

55:28.640 --> 55:32.160
to be a role model to them, 'cause
I never had anybody growing up so...

55:34.600 --> 55:37.640
Honestly my dad, I don't really have
that many memories of him,

55:37.800 --> 55:39.840
like, maybe I was like 4
he was around.

55:41.640 --> 55:45.520
My mum had like 4 jobs, I know
it was stressful for her for sure,

55:45.680 --> 55:47.120
but she never showed us that.

55:48.360 --> 55:50.400
I haven't talked to my dad
in 15 years, right,

55:50.560 --> 55:53.800
but that's great
because I know exactly...

55:53.960 --> 55:58.680
I know exactly the dad I won't be,
right, so everything's for a reason.

55:59.680 --> 56:02.760
If I had a father who was there,
I probably wouldn't be this driven,

56:03.440 --> 56:06.400
so it's a blessing and a curse.
Double sided sword as they say.

56:08.320 --> 56:11.160
I see my plan in front of me,
he's got the perfect life,

56:11.320 --> 56:13.800
he's got nothing to fight for really.

56:13.960 --> 56:16.400
I've got everything you know,
people to prove,

56:16.560 --> 56:19.560
I've got so much more in my tank
than them.

56:24.680 --> 56:27.360
Good. Fastly, fastly, fastly.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.680
Good. Along... Good.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.200
Other direction, fast feet,
stay balanced...

56:33.360 --> 56:38.040
As you get tired. Quick feet,
stay balanced. Good.

56:43.080 --> 56:44.080
Nice.

56:44.240 --> 56:45.840
Competition coming up in Qatar

56:46.000 --> 56:49.200
is our first competition
since the pandemic happened.

56:49.360 --> 56:51.880
Good. And back up. Good.

56:52.040 --> 56:56.240
I'm taking this as a massive life
jacket

56:56.880 --> 57:00.400
and I just wanna compete,
get to do what I love.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.496
It's been a long time coming and
it's going to be a little bit weird

57:06.520 --> 57:08.376
because most people haven't been
training as much

57:08.400 --> 57:10.120
or having competitions but

57:10.840 --> 57:12.560
I think we're going to see
who's been ready,

57:12.600 --> 57:14.720
who hasn't been ready,
it's going to be interesting.

57:14.880 --> 57:19.040
Drive, drive, drive...
Chest up. Drive.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.600
My goal is obviously to put it all,

57:20.760 --> 57:22.536
things I've done to the test
you know, I've been training

57:22.560 --> 57:25.720
and working, I really hope that
things that I'm doing

57:25.880 --> 57:28.440
are going to surprise people.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.000
And ultimately
get the result that I want.

57:31.680 --> 57:32.800
I want to smash everybody,

57:32.960 --> 57:35.280
I don't just want to win,
I want to smash everybody.

57:50.760 --> 57:52.920
I've started training in Sheffield,

57:54.440 --> 57:56.280
I've changed my set up,

57:57.360 --> 57:59.920
changed like physios,
changed everything really.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.760
In Dubai,
when I kind of tore my hamstring

58:02.920 --> 58:04.120
it was like a bit of a moment

58:04.280 --> 58:05.920
where I kind of like reflected
and thought

58:06.040 --> 58:08.760
well, I don't think
things are quite right.

58:16.600 --> 58:20.640
It's super tough getting back up
when you keep getting caught,

58:21.120 --> 58:25.280
but every single day we're trying
to progress and move forward.

58:26.040 --> 58:29.360
So now I need to train super hard.

58:48.560 --> 58:50.080
I feel so sick.

58:51.680 --> 58:54.080
I haven't felt like this
in a long long time,

58:54.240 --> 59:00.040
I haven't done that fast
and that long in ages.

59:00.480 --> 59:03.120
So I feel a bit, yeah.

59:03.680 --> 59:05.600
Forgot how painful it is.

59:15.560 --> 59:18.960
It's not glamorous one bit,
it's literally blood sweat and tears.

59:19.440 --> 59:25.280
You have to have focus points
in the most mundane tedious things

59:25.440 --> 59:28.000
because otherwise
you won't do anything.

59:30.200 --> 59:33.040
There's no emotions,
you just have to be very robotic,

59:33.200 --> 59:35.160
and I think I'm quite good at that.

1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:47.520
This training camp is

1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:49.880
the preparation for
tournaments in Mexico.

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:55.280
We're here with 2 really big teams to
practice with Switzerland and Czech.

1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:00.720
I'm not sure if my hip
is gonna get better or worse,

1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:05.920
just want to have that feeling that
"okay, it's going to be fine".

1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:09.160
I want to have some more confidence
than what we have right now.

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:12.640
Good to see you, man!

1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:16.760
So hot!

1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:23.680
First of all is to test
Anders hip to see if he can jump

1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:25.560
as much as we need him to do.

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.400
It's really important for us
to find a rhythm

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:31.760
and find the confidence
that we know that we had before.

1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:35.240
Of course, I'm a little bit anxious.

1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:38.400
I'm crossing my fingers
that he will be ready.

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:08.920
Working on defense

1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:11.800
the things that we are normally
good at

1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:15.200
is still there
and that's good to feel.

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:22.320
The hip is also feeling good and
that's the most important thing.

1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:28.440
It felt like we were back on track.

1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:30.400
The chemistry is on point,

1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:33.480
You can see it in his eyes
that he is really hungry

1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:35.880
to play beach volleyball
and that's, that's a great sign.

1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:43.040
We only get one week so,

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:45.800
I'm really not sure
how we're gonna go.

1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:49.720
I don't know where our level is at,

1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:52.400
and where the level
of the rest of the world is.

1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:55.360
I want to see
if we can have the level

1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:58.040
that we still had
before the pandemic hit.

1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:00.560
It's a really important event.

1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:07.136
<i>In many parts
of the world</i>

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.200
<i>some sports competitions
are finally able to resume</i>

1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:15.480
Time to go to World Championships.

1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:19.360
Off to the stadium we go

1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:24.400
<i>In New South Wales,
project restart is go</i>

1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:27.880
<i>as the Sprint Kayak season resumes.</i>

1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:31.040
To think that we haven't raced for
a whole 12 months

1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:33.560
until now is pretty crazy

1:03:57.960 --> 1:03:59.640
Being injured sucks.

1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:02.680
I feel a lot of guilt and punishment.

1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:09.480
Really weird to be back.

1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:14.640
Got hit directly in the knee caps,

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:18.200
I got severe blunt trauma knee cap.
Somebody hit a foil to my knee,

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:25.120
which ultimately is
a one month to two month recovery.

1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:27.600
I didn't break the knee cap
but it's pretty close.

1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:34.160
So put things into perspective right
and now I'm here just chilling

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.680
and just gonna do my best
to get better every day.

1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:47.840
It teaches you a lot of patience,
this sport,

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.600
so I just keep getting stronger.

1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:56.400
I'll see my coach, my friends,
my girl, I'll be good.

1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:58.440
It's all mental.

1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:02.120
And if you realize that
it's something you can't control

1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:03.840
then it's easier to process, so.

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:08.721
Something good's going to happen,
you've got to just stay,

1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:11.280
stay focused, that's all.

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:37.400
- Hiya. I'm alright.
- Are you OK?

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:49.880
It was Sunday morning training,
I was running round the track

1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:52.960
and I finished my rep
and I just couldn't walk.

1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:56.400
It got stiffer and stiffer
and stiffer

1:05:56.560 --> 1:05:58.040
and it was kind of like super sore,

1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:00.480
so it was just one
little training session

1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:03.000
and it just dawned on me, I was
like my whole season's done.

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:08.440
I couldn't quite believe it,

1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:11.880
suddenly the calendar just drops,

1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:15.440
there's no competitions,
there was nothing.

1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:18.920
It's crazy how different life is
than I had planned.

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:30.120
Now I need to get back on track
to have a long career.

1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:39.400
The positive that does come out of it

1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:43.440
is I will be stronger
mentally physically,

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:45.480
I will be a stronger athlete.

1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:49.960
I know that when I finish my career,

1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:53.720
when I'm at 30 and look back,
I'll think thank god that happened

1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:58.840
because I had 3 years out
but then I could just restart

1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.600
and then the year 2022
was so much better.

1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:36.200
I made it.
Was a long trip but I'm here.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:42.880
After almost,
what four months, right?

1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:46.360
When you always dream
you're in the airport

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:48.160
and you're like "hi" and music sounds

1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:51.400
and the camera
swerves around you, well, no.

1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:57.320
It was just like "hi" wait, alcohol,
"hi" and we shook hands.

1:07:57.480 --> 1:07:59.920
It was kind of strange
in this new world

1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:01.120
that we are living,

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:04.560
but still it was beautiful

1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:17.600
Within our philosophies, it's not
allowed to be someone else here.

1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:24.920
I know it would be hard for Ceci
to keep the two balls in the air.

1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:26.880
But...

1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:34.320
Santi will have his point of view
about it

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:36.160
and I will have my point of view.

1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:41.200
For me, getting to have Mica here
will help me now

1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:45.640
to be a better sailor
in this last part of the year

1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:48.600
and it's helping me to push harder.

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:54.040
For him, there's no excuses,
there are no excuses.

1:08:57.160 --> 1:08:59.280
But I feel I am human

1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:03.320
and I want to be a human,
more human every day.

1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:17.040
Obsessive

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.280
like Santi the best example.

1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:27.320
It is a big challenge to work
with someone like that because

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:35.200
I am one that wants to
balance a little bit her life,

1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:38.400
of course I understand that

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:45.200
to achieve what we want to achieve,
you need to be obsessive, obsessive

1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:49.120
but he's in another level
of obsession.

1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:52.600
We have a friendship relationship

1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:58.240
but a very clear cut
and then professional relationship

1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:03.200
and that relationship
sometimes is not easy.

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:11.520
And, yeah, that's like
any other team.

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:17.160
You are working to improve
that relationship and you get better.

1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:19.400
It's my job to understand

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:23.840
I am going to be a better sailor
tomorrow

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.840
if today I go for one hour

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.360
and do whatever I want to do
for an hour

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:32.040
or not

1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:34.960
and I have to do what is better
for me

1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:37.160
to be able to sailor
tomorrow in a boat.

1:11:56.400 --> 1:11:58.160
I'm finally gonna meet Ramala

1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:00.320
to finally get
the foundation stuff off the ground.

1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:03.920
She's in charge of my foundation,
she's incredible,

1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:05.456
she's the one that puts everything
together

1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:06.960
and kind of creates this deck for me.

1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:10.120
- Ramala.
- What's up?

1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:11.640
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:13.200
It's been a bloody year.

1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:15.320
Where are we at?

1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:19.160
This time has given me
real clarity on my vision.

1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:21.640
I had one of those,
not existential crisis.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:24.920
I was like sitting in quarantine,
I was like what's my purpose.

1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:27.560
And then I was like,

1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:30.120
my purpose is to give kids
opportunity that I never had right

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.096
'cause I was lucky enough
to slip through the cracks

1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:35.120
and be successful,
but it wasn't easy.

1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:37.360
And I want to
create a full on institution

1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:41.080
where kids from all walks of life
can feel comfortable.

1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:44.000
I love that... I think
that's very compelling,

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:46.560
I think you have
a very clear vision with it.

1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:51.320
I think it was 2 years ago
I was like reading my DMs

1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:54.160
and this mother messaged me,
a mixed-race kid,

1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:57.176
she was like my son was getting
bullied at school for fencing,

1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:58.656
people were making fun of him
and then he showed them

1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:00.760
a picture of you
and that changed the next day.

1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:03.360
And I cried I'm not going to lie.

1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:08.760
I was like, woah, this is bigger
than any medal you could win.

1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:13.400
You're literally giving a kid
hope right

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:18.000
and I was like that's it and then
that's what we're going to do.

1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:19.640
We're going to give these kids hope.

1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:22.400
I think this could be something
that's going to change kid's lives

1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:25.960
and that's what I think
is bigger than just me.

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:31.120
<i>In some parts of the
world professional sport</i>

1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:33.680
<i>is finally on its way back</i>

1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:36.360
<i>A few lucky fans returning to
stadiums,</i>

1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:39.760
<i>a chink of light
after an extraordinary year.</i>

1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:44.080
<i>Something to lift our
spirits, something to rally round,</i>

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:47.360
<i>sports is what does that
for millions of people...</i>

1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:53.640
Right now I'm excited
and energetic and looking forward.

1:13:57.120 --> 1:13:59.960
Right now were about 3 months
out from the Games,

1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:02.400
honestly I'm
not trying to do anything too crazy

1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:05.960
you know I know what I am
I know what I'm capable of

1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:08.680
I'm just gonna go out there
and seize the moment and

1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:10.720
try to put on a show.

1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:14.560
I feel like this is one of the most
amazing summers.

1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:17.240
I think it doesn't get
any better than being able

1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:20.760
to inspire people
and just go out there and shine.

1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:26.056
<i>It comes down to the
final two</i>

1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:29.040
<i>to see who will take the gold medal.</i>

1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:31.600
<i>Competitors from Norway.</i>

1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:37.560
<i>This is the first outing
on the world tour</i>

1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:40.440
<i>since the tour finals in Rome, 2019.</i>

1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:44.080
We went there and didn't
expect too much,

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:49.240
just hoping that our level was okay
and honestly it was good.

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:53.560
Standing there together with him,
it's a really good feeling.

1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:59.680
I was watching his face if something
is okay or is he in some pain.

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:10.880
We play really good from the
beginning.

1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:16.400
We won match after match,
we were on fire and we were ready

1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:23.520
It's just really amazing to be back
on the court with Anders.

1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:28.360
<i>And finally after an
epic battle,</i>

1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:34.200
<i>it's Norway that take
win Number 11 here in Cancun.</i>

1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:40.720
<i>This off season through the pandemic
has been so tough.</i>

1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:45.040
<i>Hip injury to Anders Mol, it's been
a battle through recovery,</i>

1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:49.160
<i>they really are
at the top of this sport.</i>

1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:52.440
We are leaving Mexico with two wins.

1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:55.200
<i>It's a straight sets win
for Norway,</i>

1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:59.000
<i>another gold medal
for this remarkable duo.</i>

1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:03.480
The Vikings are back playing our best
volleyball that we have ever played.

1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:08.000
I've had this dream of being
the best player of the world

1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:11.600
for so long now,
and now I'm living the dream.

1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:15.440
It's been
a really difficult year

1:16:15.600 --> 1:16:18.960
to be back on the level
we are today in Mexico,

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:22.600
it was just like a fairy tale
with a happy ending.

1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:24.840
- Congrats, guys!
- Thank you, thank you.

1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:52.440
Whenever you decide
you want to be on a campaign,

1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:59.360
there's no opportunities to doubt,
if you doubt, you're out of the game

1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:06.000
I don't think there
would be many women out there

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:11.680
that can be from June to December
without seeing her girlfriend

1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:14.120
when they were dreaming
about having a baby.

1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:17.280
I don't think I could find
any other partner

1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:19.160
that are willing to do that

1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:22.200
and I know I am special

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.440
and to find another crazy one

1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:28.760
to to understand what we are playing

1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:30.720
is just amazing.

1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:35.400
Always in life
when you make a decision,

1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:38.200
you gain and you lose.

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:41.880
But after making the decision,

1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:46.320
the important thing is to
stop thinking about what you lose

1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:48.680
and start thinking
about what you gain.

1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:55.520
Sailing is a very special sport.

1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:59.320
When the water hits the hull,

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.560
when you feel the wind in your face,

1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:05.000
when you have to adapt yourself,

1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:09.040
face those big storms out there,

1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:13.440
it's like
when you have to adapt yourself

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.200
to what's happening in life.

1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:22.480
And at the end of the storm,
we feel stronger.

1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:31.360
I am optimistic for what comes ahead

1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:35.240
because I believe in us.

1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:05.560
You have your ups and
downs, you know.

1:20:06.520 --> 1:20:09.360
But it's a learning experience.

1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:13.680
You have different feelings
about different things.

1:20:14.600 --> 1:20:18.080
I don't know, she may be mad.

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:22.680
There are many ways to win a medal,

1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:26.880
there is no one way,
there are lots of ways.

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:34.800
We are dreaming for the highest
we can get in our sport

1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:41.680
and I really believe in our team
and I really believe in Ceci.

1:20:54.680 --> 1:20:56.120
So my summer season is over

1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:58.760
but this year has made me
stronger than I've ever been.

1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:04.920
Lockdown has brought back the passion
that I have for the game.

1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:08.360
I think I appreciate there's other
things in life,

1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:10.640
not only standing on top of the
podium

1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:14.440
with the trophy above your head
but also like the small things.

1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:18.360
I put the work in, I'm ready.

1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:29.280
You know this year has taught me
in a lot of ways

1:21:29.440 --> 1:21:31.000
of how resilient I am.

1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:33.240
I'm completely rebuilding,
completely restarting

1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:34.840
and obviously that's super exciting.

1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:45.080
Didn't realize how lucky we were
just to be out there competing.

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:50.000
To have some negative experiences
then you for sure appreciate

1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:51.720
the positive things a lot more.

1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:55.560
It's been a long road, the biggest
thing I've taken from this

1:21:55.720 --> 1:21:57.200
is that nothing can break me.

1:21:57.360 --> 1:21:59.080
Today I feel very privileged

1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:03.000
to do what I'm doing and I'm sure
the next step will be great as well

1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:09.280
We will never know if it was
good for us or not this postponement.

1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:13.400
I think personally
that it made us stronger.
