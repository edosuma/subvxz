WEBVTT

00:02.635 --> 00:04.804
[Andrea]
Oh, yeah.

00:04.871 --> 00:06.373
[Mike]
You want me to wash right here?

00:06.439 --> 00:09.743
Mmm... yeah,
that feels good.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.845
Oh, ow, ow, ow! Ah!

00:11.911 --> 00:14.047
I can't lift my arm
any higher,

00:14.114 --> 00:17.083
but there's, like,
conditioner still in my hair.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.618
How did you do this again?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.721
Uh, I did it yawning?

00:21.788 --> 00:23.923
You pulled a muscle
in your neck from yawning.

00:23.990 --> 00:26.192
Yeah, I am not
a young person.

00:26.259 --> 00:28.194
It wasn't even, like,
with a stretch.

00:28.261 --> 00:31.164
It was, like, all jaw.

00:31.231 --> 00:35.235
Thank you for helping me
in my time of need.

00:35.301 --> 00:37.036
Can I wash your boobs?

00:37.103 --> 00:38.772
Is that why
you're helping me?

00:38.838 --> 00:40.340
No.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.776
Can I wash my boobs?

00:40.407 --> 00:42.776
No.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.310
Fine. Turn around
so I can rinse your back.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.945
Come on. [whistles]

00:46.012 --> 00:49.516
Don't whistle at me
like I'm some sort of dog.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.651
A dog would let me
wash his boobs.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.254
I will say,
I can get used to this.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.724
I see where Stephen Hawking
fell for his nurse.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.093
You're comparing yourself
to Stephen Hawking now?

01:00.160 --> 01:02.562
[imitating robot voice]
Yes, Mike, thank you very much

01:02.629 --> 01:04.664
for all of your help today.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.099
No, I'm getting out.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.234
[continues in robot voice]
No, Mike, wash my boobs.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.404
Now I'm torn.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.404
You have to choose between

01:11.471 --> 01:17.944
my boobs and nothing, even
though they are paralyzed boobs.

01:18.011 --> 01:21.581
[laughing]
Stop!

01:21.648 --> 01:24.851
â™ª

01:38.131 --> 01:39.466
Hey, dad, what's happening?

01:38.131 --> 01:39.466
<i>Hey!</i>

01:39.532 --> 01:41.034
You know how I'm thinking

01:41.100 --> 01:43.269
of turning the front room
of the house into a club?

01:43.336 --> 01:48.842
No, uh, but you got my
attention, I am listening.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.143
<i>As a decor thing.</i>

01:50.210 --> 01:52.111
I want to put some
sensual photography

01:52.178 --> 01:53.980
up on the walls,
you know.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.782
I wondered if you have
any boudoir photos

01:55.849 --> 01:57.851
you'd be comfortable
sending to me.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.219
<i>What is happening</i>
<i>right now?</i>

01:59.285 --> 02:00.720
Why do you think
this is an okay thing

02:00.787 --> 02:03.490
to be asking
your daughter for?

02:03.556 --> 02:05.859
Oh, come on, I just want
to celebrate the beauty

02:05.925 --> 02:07.327
of the women
in our family.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.128
Bonnie's doing it,
so are her nieces,

02:09.195 --> 02:11.731
and I also want my own family
to be represented.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.800
On your sensual wall?

02:13.867 --> 02:15.034
Okay, you know,
even it's something

02:15.101 --> 02:16.769
that doesn't show
your face.

02:16.836 --> 02:20.840
If not my face, what of me
do you want to show?

02:20.907 --> 02:22.842
Dad, what is
happening right now?

02:22.909 --> 02:26.312
Well, what?

02:22.909 --> 02:26.312
<i>You know what, Dad,</i>
<i>I'm going to take a pass</i>

02:26.379 --> 02:29.682
on this one-- I guess
I appreciate the ask.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.284
Will you at least
think about it?

02:31.351 --> 02:33.720
There is literally not a world
where I will not be thinking

02:33.786 --> 02:36.489
about this for
the rest of my life.

02:36.556 --> 02:39.259
Great, thanks, good-bye.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.060
Bye!

02:41.127 --> 02:45.198
Well, your eyes look good.

02:41.127 --> 02:45.198
Great.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.334
I am surprised you don't
need reading glasses.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.770
Well, I'm just trying
to keep it all together.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.238
[chuckles]

02:50.837 --> 02:52.238
If it makes you feel any better,

02:52.305 --> 02:56.709
I did throw my neck out from
yawning last week, so...

02:56.776 --> 02:59.979
That does happen
to people at our age.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.714
Mm-hmm.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.714
You got a little girl,
don't you?

03:01.781 --> 03:04.484
Yeah, Amelia, she's heading
to kindergarten next year.

03:04.551 --> 03:05.685
I cannot believe it.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.520
You guys thinking about
having another one?

03:07.587 --> 03:10.023
Uh, maybe, you know,
we haven't totally decided yet.

03:10.089 --> 03:14.894
Biological child, you gotta
just, just jump on it.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.763
Oh, yeah, okay, yeah.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.798
Yeah, I know that these days
people seem to be having kids

03:18.865 --> 03:23.269
in their 40's but, if you want
to know, most of them aren't--

03:23.336 --> 03:26.573
it's not their sperm,
not their egg.

03:26.639 --> 03:30.510
Oh, okay, great, great, um...

03:30.577 --> 03:34.681
So, do I need a new
contact prescription or...

03:34.747 --> 03:36.215
No, you are good.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.585
Great, so it's
just the eggs.

03:38.651 --> 03:40.119
Just the eggs.

03:40.186 --> 03:45.325
Oh... you're high-fiving
me now, okay.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.863
Hey, does our optometrist
ever high-five you?

03:50.930 --> 03:52.999
I wouldn't know,
I haven't been in years.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.701
Seriously? Why?

03:54.767 --> 03:56.469
I have perfect vision.

03:56.536 --> 03:59.005
Okay, you don't have
to act like you earned

03:59.072 --> 04:00.473
your 20/20 vision, okay?

04:00.540 --> 04:02.241
It's genetic,
you've done nothing.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.110
Maybe you kept them
from being, like,

04:04.177 --> 04:06.179
gouged out by
a bird or something.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.147
I never look directly
in the sun.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.083
Brag!

04:08.214 --> 04:10.083
How are your eyes?

04:10.149 --> 04:11.651
Actually, my eyes
are good, but apparently

04:11.718 --> 04:13.820
my eggs are turning
into ova-dust.

04:13.886 --> 04:17.824
What?

04:13.886 --> 04:17.824
Yeah, my optometrist was giving
me fertility advice, you know,

04:17.890 --> 04:19.092
as optometrists do.

04:19.158 --> 04:20.960
I think you should
switch optometrists.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.663
Or I just shift them
into the OBGYN spot.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.531
I feel like Dr. Sapkin
would be comfortable

04:25.598 --> 04:27.834
with only getting
in my eyes for a while.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.903
I really hate to say it,
but maybe he did have a point.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.706
I mean, we have talked about
possibly having an other child,

04:33.773 --> 04:35.441
and we are not young people.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.343
But apparently I look
the same age as him.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.545
What?

04:37.410 --> 04:39.545
Yeah, and he is a solid 60.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.247
So at least another
highlight of the appointment,

04:41.314 --> 04:42.849
the hits just kept coming.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.552
But I do think that maybe we
should get our friends checked.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.254
Yeah.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.254
Don't you think we'd feel better

04:48.321 --> 04:50.790
knowing that everything
was kosher down there?

04:50.857 --> 04:52.291
Not loving the
kosher-genital connection.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.893
You know in all
the medical journals

04:53.960 --> 04:57.096
where they're like,
"This looks kosher, tit out,"

04:57.163 --> 04:59.132
or "This looks kosher,
keep it in."

04:59.198 --> 05:01.034
I think it's a great idea, I
think you're right, let's do it.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.468
All right, let's do it.

05:02.535 --> 05:05.438
The good news is,
even if my eggs are dead,

05:05.505 --> 05:09.375
my Dad still thinks I'm hot
enough to get on his sex wall,

05:09.442 --> 05:12.645
so everybody wins
except me.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.480
Have you gotten back
to him about that yet?

05:14.547 --> 05:18.351
Ugh, well, first I told him
no f-ing way, but then I,

05:18.418 --> 05:20.420
you know what, there's one photo
that I'd thought I'd show him.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.689
I was thinking
about sending this.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.657
No!

05:22.755 --> 05:24.657
[laughing] This?

05:24.724 --> 05:26.159
I thought you were
gonna get rid of that.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.327
I'm not gonna get rid of it.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.430
You don't get rid of a piece
of art like this.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.831
I hid it in one of
the folders.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.600
If you need it,
it's under "Taxes 2013".

05:34.667 --> 05:36.703
In what circumstance would
I ever need to find that?

05:36.769 --> 05:40.373
Uh, if the North Koreans
were bombing Los Angeles

05:40.440 --> 05:41.874
and they said the only
thing that would stop us

05:41.941 --> 05:43.910
is we'd love to see
a photo of a woman

05:43.976 --> 05:45.978
aggressively biting a dick
and clearly loving it.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.648
Yeah.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.648
If I have cancer
and my only dying wish

05:48.715 --> 05:51.317
is to see a photo
of a woman biting a dick.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.721
Or if Amelia's life depended
on it and it was like,

05:54.787 --> 05:57.590
the only way that a kidnapper
would give her back.

05:57.657 --> 06:01.160
Right, those are legit.

05:57.657 --> 06:01.160
Do you remember the name
of the folder?

06:01.227 --> 06:04.697
"Taxes 2013".

06:04.764 --> 06:07.600
I'm not saying that we
are having another baby.

06:07.667 --> 06:08.968
We just want to have
our stuff checked out

06:09.035 --> 06:10.670
to keep our options open.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.539
So Mike has to get
his stuff checked too?

06:13.606 --> 06:16.275
Mom, why are you smirking?

06:16.342 --> 06:19.011
I just think it's funny
he has to go to an office

06:19.078 --> 06:20.480
to do his business.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.682
You are ridiculous.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.682
Have a sense of humor.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.550
Oh, have a sense of humor?
Okay.

06:24.617 --> 06:27.320
Oh, I like that, Bubsy!

06:24.617 --> 06:27.320
Nice work, honey.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.222
It's hula hoop time!

06:29.288 --> 06:33.159
Hula hoop time? Okay.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.828
Let's see if I still got this.
You want to be impressed?

06:35.895 --> 06:39.532
Look at you!

06:35.895 --> 06:39.532
Oh, I'm sorry, like this?

06:39.599 --> 06:40.867
By the way, shouldn't
you be hearing something

06:40.933 --> 06:42.802
about Amelia getting
into kindergarten?

06:42.869 --> 06:43.903
This week.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.838
Apparently all schools
contact every family

06:45.905 --> 06:47.306
at the exact same time--

06:47.373 --> 06:48.875
Friday at two.

06:48.941 --> 06:50.543
What? Why do they do it that
way? That's terrible.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.478
It must just be like,
just better be safe,

06:52.545 --> 06:53.980
tell everyone at once.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.649
Hi, Daddy!

06:54.046 --> 06:56.649
Hey, baby.

06:56.716 --> 06:58.751
Hey, Sharon.

06:56.716 --> 06:58.751
Hi, Mike.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.419
I heard about your
upcoming check-up.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.522
Are you sure you're "up"
for the part?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.924
Sharon, are you joking
about my semen?

07:04.991 --> 07:07.160
[chuckling]
Yeah!

07:07.226 --> 07:09.996
I am!

07:07.226 --> 07:09.996
I'm sorry, honey.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.735
Stop giggling.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.237
Oh, it's funny, come on.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.237
I know, did you see his face?

07:18.304 --> 07:19.739
[both laughing]

07:22.441 --> 07:25.745
[phone ringtone]

07:25.812 --> 07:28.447
Hi, Dad.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.447
Hi, pumpkin, what you doing?

07:28.514 --> 07:29.916
<i>I'm on my way to pick up</i>
<i>Amelia from school.</i>

07:29.982 --> 07:31.284
What are you doing?

07:31.350 --> 07:35.488
Are you like, nude
in a jacuzzi, smoking peyote?

07:35.555 --> 07:36.556
Am I close?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.157
No, that was last night.

07:38.224 --> 07:41.127
Oh... [mock laughs]
We have fun!

07:41.194 --> 07:43.196
Now, listen, have you
given any more thought

07:43.262 --> 07:45.898
to those boudoir photos
I asked about?

07:45.965 --> 07:48.067
Uh, I've definitely
given it more thought,

07:48.134 --> 07:50.036
probably not in the way
you're hoping.

07:50.102 --> 07:52.271
Dad, I honestly, I really,

07:52.338 --> 07:54.540
I don't know how else to say
this-- it's not gonna happen.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.442
I will have it printed
and pay for the framing,

07:56.509 --> 07:57.844
I know that
can be expensive.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.179
Dad, it could not be
less about the cost.

08:00.246 --> 08:02.081
Well, I'd just like to
get the photo wall up

08:02.148 --> 08:03.749
before the barbeque
this weekend.

08:03.816 --> 08:07.019
Yeah, everyone wants
to look at sensual photography

08:07.086 --> 08:08.654
of the family
while eating ribs.

08:08.721 --> 08:12.058
[text alerts bleeping]

08:08.721 --> 08:12.058
Oh, my God, I am blowing up.

08:12.124 --> 08:15.194
Oh, it must be two.

08:12.124 --> 08:15.194
Wh-what happened?

08:15.261 --> 08:19.365
Yay! Amelia got into Weston!
That was the school we wanted.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.501
<i>And even the back-up!</i>

08:19.432 --> 08:22.501
Yes! I knew she would!

08:22.568 --> 08:25.204
Dad, do you even know
how old Amelia is?

08:25.271 --> 08:27.974
Of course I do, she's seven.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.974
She's five.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.976
Right, she's five.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.976
<i>Oh, my God,</i>

08:30.042 --> 08:31.444
I gotta go.

08:34.413 --> 08:39.719
[indistinct conversation]

08:43.956 --> 08:45.458
Hey.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.458
Hey, we didn't get into our

08:45.524 --> 08:46.959
first choice, we didn't
get our second choice.

08:47.026 --> 08:50.396
How'd it go for you?

08:47.026 --> 08:50.396
I forgot my phone.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.265
Are you joking?

08:50.463 --> 08:52.265
No, you know what-- [stammers]

08:52.331 --> 08:55.868
Right after this, I'm gonna
run home and, and, you know,

08:55.935 --> 08:57.136
see what happened.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.905
You should borrow my phone.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.905
Yeah.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.339
Oh, you know, that's okay.

09:00.406 --> 09:03.809
I should probably be alone
when I check that.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.213
I heard Weston only took four
kids that weren't siblings.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.282
Really?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.282
Yeah.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.317
God, that's crazy,
oh, my God.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.085
A lot of parents
are coming over tonight,

09:13.152 --> 09:14.587
we're gonna drink wine
and commiserate.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.056
Okay, yeah, no, if I can,
I will 100% be there.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.524
You know, I gotta go
grab Amelia,

09:18.591 --> 09:22.361
but I'll let you know
what happens.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.767
All right, Amelia,
we gotta go, come on.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.136
But I want to play.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.136
No, no, no, we gotta go.

09:30.202 --> 09:32.605
Come on, come on, come on.

09:30.202 --> 09:32.605
Why do we have to go right now?

09:32.672 --> 09:34.340
Well, because Mommy's
gotta take some photos

09:34.407 --> 09:36.375
for Grampy's barbeque.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.444
You know what, that's a lie,
I can't even hear that out loud.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.913
We're late for the toy store,
come on, it's windy.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.315
Do we got to go?

09:42.381 --> 09:44.383
Yeah, we got to go--
run, run, run run!

09:46.886 --> 09:48.654
Bubs, you remember
Weston, the school

09:48.721 --> 09:50.356
with the spinny thing
that you liked?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.991
Guess what? That's where
you're going to go

09:52.058 --> 09:53.159
to kindergarten
next year.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.860
Really?

09:53.225 --> 09:54.860
Yes.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.696
Yep, you're a lucky girl,
that's a really good school.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.197
I know.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.333
You know, I think I'll
email all these schools,

10:00.399 --> 10:02.168
just to thank them for making
the process so pleasant.

10:02.234 --> 10:03.936
I liked all those people,
they were great.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.238
And also, you know,
I'm gonna email Weston,

10:06.305 --> 10:08.374
say we're very excited to be
part of their community,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.242
because that's how I'm
going to be talking now.

10:10.309 --> 10:14.046
Okay.

10:10.309 --> 10:14.046
You know how involved I like
to be with Amelia's school.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.448
God, we don't have to
volunteer, do we?

10:15.514 --> 10:17.984
Um, I want to get
a beer, do you want one?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.752
Oh, no, no beer for you.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.420
You're up first thing tomorrow
morning, doctor's office.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.322
Oh, right, forgot about that.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.091
We need your sperm with
their eye on the prize,

10:25.157 --> 10:27.960
but also want them to have
a kind of a calm confidence

10:28.027 --> 10:31.397
that says, "I got this."

10:31.464 --> 10:33.933
That's a lot of
nuance for sperm.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.068
You guys, you got this.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.470
[whispers]
I believe in you.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.872
Hey, hey, Andrea,
what you doing?

10:39.939 --> 10:42.341
Hey, hi.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.944
So, how'd you guys
make out today, huh?

10:45.011 --> 10:49.015
Uh, it was-- has been
a crazy day, crazy.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.417
How did you guys end up?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.786
Rough.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.786
I'm sorry.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.389
Still don't know where Izzy's
going to go to school next year.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.758
I'm going to Weston.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.726
We got into Weston too!
Yeah!

11:00.793 --> 11:03.129
Why didn't you say anything?

11:00.793 --> 11:03.129
You guys didn't say anything.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.031
I wasn't going to say
anything when you're like,

11:05.097 --> 11:06.899
"I don't know where Izzy's
going to go next year."

11:06.966 --> 11:10.436
Okay, spot-on impersonation.

11:06.966 --> 11:10.436
I have a gift, I have an ear.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.839
But honestly, it has been
crazy tough, so...

11:13.906 --> 11:16.675
I know, I know, a lot of
people are upset.

11:16.742 --> 11:19.111
Actually,
we also got into Waverly.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.280
Oh, my God, so did we.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.516
All right, you know what,
this actually feels gross.

11:23.582 --> 11:24.950
This is nasty, yeah.

11:23.582 --> 11:24.950
All right, please go.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.152
Right on, bye-bye.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.253
Hey, good to see you guys.

11:27.319 --> 11:30.022
Oh, hold on--
good to see you!

11:30.089 --> 11:32.324
See?

11:32.391 --> 11:35.061
I think he was
saying bye to your balls.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.395
Yeah.

11:38.397 --> 11:42.201
Oh, my God,
it's early, Jesus.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.171
I feel sorry for you.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.171
It's okay.

11:45.237 --> 11:48.641
Hi.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.943
Do you think maybe we shouldn't
have brought Amelia with us?

11:51.010 --> 11:53.813
Why?

11:51.010 --> 11:53.813
Well, we're going to
a fertility clinic.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.347
Don't you think we
look like we're bragging,

11:55.414 --> 11:57.249
like, "We already got one.

11:57.316 --> 11:58.884
Now we're just
looking for back-up."

11:58.951 --> 12:01.353
It's fine, and besides,
it's seven a.m. on Saturday.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.956
What else were we
gonna do with her?

12:04.023 --> 12:06.525
Oh, excuse us, sorry.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.525
Oops, sorry.

12:06.592 --> 12:08.227
Thank you.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.096
All right, Bubs,
sit over here, okay?

12:10.162 --> 12:13.566
Mommy, look at Walter
and me dance.

12:13.632 --> 12:16.969
Okay, let's not dance,
let's, um...

12:17.036 --> 12:19.772
Okay, you know what, let's
color, let's do a little...

12:19.839 --> 12:23.509
coloring-- that's better.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.311
She's so sweet.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.113
Oh, thank you.

12:27.179 --> 12:31.050
But, you know, it also can be
a lot sometimes, you know,

12:31.117 --> 12:32.418
a lot of work.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.320
Yeah, but I'm sure
it's worth it.

12:34.386 --> 12:37.790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:37.857 --> 12:40.626
But also, there's a lot
of things in life

12:40.693 --> 12:42.761
that are worth it too.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.664
There's just--
there's so many fun things.

12:45.731 --> 12:49.568
Mm-hmm.

12:45.731 --> 12:49.568
We're just, um...

12:49.635 --> 12:51.470
We're probably just
gonna stick with the one,

12:51.537 --> 12:55.107
we're very appreciative
of what we have.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.143
Yeah.

12:57.209 --> 12:58.878
Anyway.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.479
How long did they say?

13:00.546 --> 13:02.081
You-- they're gonna
see you right away.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.783
Oh, good.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.783
But I've got a couple
of guys ahead of me.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.919
There's only one
masturbatorium?

13:06.986 --> 13:09.455
Yeah, they call it
a "deposit" room, actually.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.723
Really?

13:09.522 --> 13:10.723
Yeah.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.091
I don't like that.

13:12.158 --> 13:15.628
Todd?

13:15.694 --> 13:17.663
Right this way.

13:18.664 --> 13:19.999
Pull it together.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.168
We know what Todd's
doing back there.

13:22.234 --> 13:25.171
Yes, we do.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.273
[chuckles softly]

13:29.675 --> 13:33.612
Do you think he'll look
like he lost weight?

13:38.417 --> 13:39.852
Thanks.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.254
Did you notice that
everyone walks in exhausted

13:42.321 --> 13:45.591
and then leaves with a real
spring in their step?

13:45.658 --> 13:46.959
He had a good time
back there.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.394
How long do you
think this is gonna be?

13:48.460 --> 13:50.663
Well, you got two guys
still ahead of you,

13:50.729 --> 13:52.198
average time has
been 14 minutes--

13:52.264 --> 13:53.933
the bald guy took
a little longer,

13:53.999 --> 13:55.534
but I think that's
because he's older.

13:55.601 --> 13:59.505
My money's on blue shirt
over here to... [clicks tongue]

13:59.572 --> 14:00.940
hit the record.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.675
There's a record?

14:01.006 --> 14:02.675
Eleven minutes.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.643
You gotta stop
timing people.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.346
I know, I'm sorry, I can't help
it-- I'm glancing at the clock

14:07.413 --> 14:09.682
and then I get invested.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.383
By the way...

14:11.450 --> 14:13.352
You got a "plan of attack"
for back there?

14:13.419 --> 14:14.820
What are we working with?

14:14.887 --> 14:16.622
I got some images
I'm gonna work off of.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.657
Do I make a cameo
in any of them?

14:18.724 --> 14:20.259
You pop in and out.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.594
Really?

14:20.326 --> 14:21.594
Mm-hmm.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.229
Brett?

14:27.433 --> 14:29.401
Kind of like the reverse
walk of shame.

14:29.468 --> 14:32.671
[all chuckling softly]

14:29.468 --> 14:32.671
Please don't engage the room.

14:35.674 --> 14:36.909
All right, I think
we're safe, though,

14:36.976 --> 14:38.510
as long as it's daylight.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.946
We don't stay past sundown
with the erotic wall

14:41.013 --> 14:42.448
and newfound love of edibles.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.216
By the way, Bubs,
don't eat any chocolate

14:44.283 --> 14:45.217
you see lying
around Grampy's.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.386
Why?

14:47.453 --> 14:50.322
Grampy's chocolate makes
tummies hurt.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.657
You made it.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.657
Hi, Grampy!

14:51.724 --> 14:54.159
Hey, sweetie!

14:51.724 --> 14:54.159
Of course we made it-- hi!

14:54.226 --> 14:55.227
Hi, how are you, mwah!

14:54.226 --> 14:55.227
Mwah!

14:55.294 --> 14:57.029
Hey, there.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.029
Michael.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.131
All right, Dad, just let's get
it done-- where's the "club"

14:59.198 --> 15:00.899
you've been going on about?

15:00.966 --> 15:03.869
Well, it can't be a club,
I mean, obviously it's my home,

15:03.936 --> 15:05.004
but it feels like a club.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.572
I've got--

15:05.070 --> 15:06.572
This?

15:06.639 --> 15:08.641
Yeah, I got the deep seating,
the comfy chairs.

15:08.707 --> 15:12.244
And look at this-- I got
little wine bar over there.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.613
This is-- I like this,
actually.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.916
And this is the, uh,
sensual wall here.

15:20.386 --> 15:21.887
So we just don't look
at that one wall.

15:21.954 --> 15:22.955
Right.

15:21.954 --> 15:22.955
Great.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.457
Let me get you something
to eat, come on.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.559
Hey, you made it,
you're there.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.695
Oh, well, oh, he took
that off his phone.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.631
That's me, right to the left
of Bonnie in her underwear

15:32.698 --> 15:36.402
and underneath short snow top.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.872
Okay, so this is happening.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.872
Yeah.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.945
[general conversations]

15:48.414 --> 15:51.317
I have to say, this is
actually a very nice barbeque.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.752
Very nice barbeque, right?

15:53.819 --> 15:55.688
I didn't know what we
were going to be coming into.

15:55.754 --> 15:56.889
I didn't know if I was
going to have to wear

15:56.955 --> 15:59.658
a full body condom
or something.

15:59.725 --> 16:02.995
It's a lovely party,
and we made the wall.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.596
Is that a goal of yours?

16:04.663 --> 16:07.132
Well, no, but it's nice
to be included.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.101
By the way, how did it go
at the doctor's this morning?

16:09.168 --> 16:12.604
Oh, good news--
I got follicles for days.

16:12.671 --> 16:14.340
We're just waiting
on Mike's results.

16:14.406 --> 16:15.674
[chuckling]

16:14.406 --> 16:15.674
Mom...

16:15.741 --> 16:17.309
Why are you smirking now?

16:17.376 --> 16:20.412
By the way, when he was in the
deposit room doing his business,

16:20.479 --> 16:22.614
your face popped up
when you texted,

16:22.681 --> 16:24.683
"How's it going?"
with the rain emoji.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.618
Well, they didn't have a sperm
emoji, did you know that?

16:26.685 --> 16:28.520
I'm sure there is
a sperm emoji somewhere,

16:28.587 --> 16:30.122
you just have to go
to the right--

16:28.587 --> 16:30.122
Well, I couldn't find one.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.724
But anyway, he had to
start over from scratch,

16:31.790 --> 16:34.360
and it really affected his time.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.360
His time?

16:34.426 --> 16:35.994
Oh, you'll appreciate this.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.464
So, I was timing
all the guys to see

16:38.530 --> 16:40.332
how fast they came in
and out of the room.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.735
[both chuckling]

16:42.801 --> 16:45.637
Thanks to you, though,
Mike came in last.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.673
What was the record?

16:45.704 --> 16:47.673
Eleven minutes.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.308
Oh, I've done six.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.511
Well, listen, I've done four,
so... tough times.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.980
[clanking bottle]

16:55.047 --> 16:58.384
Yeah, um, I just wanted to take
a minute to thank you all

16:58.450 --> 16:59.818
for being here, you know,

16:59.885 --> 17:03.088
it's not every day
that I get everyone

17:03.155 --> 17:08.227
in one place,
people that I...

17:08.293 --> 17:11.029
Um, I love all of you.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.464
Enjoy the ribs.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.465
Cheers.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.000
[all]
Cheers.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.505
Wow, that was actually
very nice.

17:19.571 --> 17:22.541
I'm telling you, as guys get
older they get more sentimental.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.909
Remember my dad?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.644
He started crying
at every sunset.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.346
Oh, that was an
uncomfortable trip to Hawaii.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.948
I'm just happy that
he's appreciating his family,

17:30.015 --> 17:32.785
other than a, you know,
put out your nipples

17:32.851 --> 17:34.520
and hang 'em on a wall
kind of way.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.822
I'm insulted that he hasn't
asked for my picture.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.090
I'm sure if you got
yourself naked on a beach

17:38.157 --> 17:40.058
he'd throw you up there.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.058
He better.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.761
You don't make his,
I'll hang you up on mine.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.997
Oh, I wouldn't automatically
go up on your wall?

17:45.063 --> 17:46.665
Oh, no, no, it's a
very tough screening process.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.200
There's a lot of applicants.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.200
Oh.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.602
Can you, like, stand on a beach,
like, with your back to it,

17:50.669 --> 17:54.206
and, like, just hold one breast
and just look over your shoulder

17:54.273 --> 17:57.476
like you didn't know
I was standing there?

17:57.543 --> 17:58.544
What are you doing here?

17:58.610 --> 17:59.778
Oh, that's good.

17:58.610 --> 17:59.778
Yeah.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.580
Are you covering your nipples?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.580
Yeah.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.450
'Cause I'm going to need you
to show those.

18:04.516 --> 18:05.551
So...

18:04.516 --> 18:05.551
[sighs]

18:05.617 --> 18:07.386
Bye, Martin.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.386
Bye, thanks.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.288
Bye, Grampy.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.288
Bye, sweetheart.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.123
Bye, Dad.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.123
Thank you.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.091
Thank you so much for coming.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.091
Oh, of course.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.927
It means so much
that you made the effort.

18:14.993 --> 18:18.230
This was so fun, and by the way,
this was very nice.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.466
I'm not sure I've
ever seen you this happy.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.468
Well, that's the point
of the drug.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.102
What do you mean?

18:24.169 --> 18:25.804
I'm on Ecstasy.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.144
Okay.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.112
Bye.

18:38.684 --> 18:42.688
He's doing Ecstasy at
a daytime family barbeque?

18:42.754 --> 18:44.056
What is happening?

18:44.122 --> 18:46.525
This is insane, right?

18:44.122 --> 18:46.525
Yes, this is insane.

18:46.592 --> 18:48.794
I don't even know how to
process this at this point.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.662
It's just-- is this a phase?

18:50.729 --> 18:51.930
I don't know
if this is a phase.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.665
If it is, when are we gonna
end the phase?

18:53.732 --> 18:55.901
I just assumed that he
really thought my pants

18:55.968 --> 18:57.269
were made out of
a cool material.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.705
Because he wanted to
get in your pants

18:59.771 --> 19:02.674
because he was on
Ecstasy, Mike.

19:02.741 --> 19:05.344
This is a man who's doing this
in front of his granddaughter,

19:05.410 --> 19:06.612
I mean...

19:06.678 --> 19:08.547
I don't want to have to
cut off all ties with him,

19:08.614 --> 19:11.016
but he needs to know that this
behavior's not okay with me.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.718
You're not gonna change him.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.718
I know.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.319
But you should tell him
that it pissed you off.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.755
He needs to know.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.755
Oh, I am going to.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.192
Hopefully he won't be, like,
on meth or something at the time

19:20.259 --> 19:22.895
because it's just
like those mouth sores

19:22.961 --> 19:24.496
can be very distracting.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.532
I have something that's
gonna make you feel better.

19:26.598 --> 19:30.168
All right, yeah?

19:26.598 --> 19:30.168
It's a little something
I call "Off The Charts".

19:30.235 --> 19:32.671
I'm not enjoying it
so far, but, okay.

19:32.738 --> 19:36.475
I got my results back today
and my sperm is off the charts.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.111
Oh! Yay, yay, yay!

19:39.177 --> 19:42.414
Okay, see? Maybe we're not
as old as we thought we were.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.816
I'm still clinging on
by my fingertips.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.585
Well, the only thing
I'm clinging onto

19:46.652 --> 19:48.887
is the edge of the charts.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.422
Really?

19:50.489 --> 19:53.992
But don't take
my word for it, here.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.627
Oh, this very official
medical document

19:55.694 --> 19:58.597
that just weirdly happened
to be on your nightstand?

19:58.664 --> 20:00.165
Yep.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.901
Mobility off the charts,
consistency off the charts.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.470
Oh!

20:02.968 --> 20:05.470
Cytoplasmic droplets.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.040
Two? Two doesn't seem
off the charts.

20:08.106 --> 20:10.542
Tail length, OTC.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.011
"Tail length"? Like that's
the sexy part of your sperm,

20:13.078 --> 20:15.280
the tail length?

20:13.078 --> 20:15.280
Did I over-play the tail length?

20:15.347 --> 20:17.849
Look, is this going to be
something that you just,

20:17.916 --> 20:19.284
like, brag about a lot?

20:19.351 --> 20:21.219
Because, as your friend,
I need you to know that this

20:21.286 --> 20:23.422
is not a great color on you,
just so you know.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.856
Oh, you know what
does have good color?

20:24.923 --> 20:26.124
[imitating robot voice]
Your sperm?

20:26.191 --> 20:27.960
Is that the thing
that has good color?

20:28.026 --> 20:29.895
Remember me from the shower?

20:29.962 --> 20:31.196
Yeah, my penis hates you.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.999
I don't think
that's the case.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.368
Just keep working on it.

20:36.435 --> 20:39.271
Oh, God, why are you doing that?

20:36.435 --> 20:39.271
You will learn to love my bite.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.674
Stop, no.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.674
You will learn to love it.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.076
You will love me.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.150
Oh, what a surprise.

20:52.217 --> 20:54.519
I didn't expect you--
what are you doing here?

20:52.217 --> 20:54.519
Hi!

20:54.586 --> 20:56.388
Dad, can we have
a conversation?

20:56.455 --> 20:59.524
Sure, absolu-- what--
is everything okay?

20:59.591 --> 21:01.660
Listen, I know that
you've been exploring

21:01.727 --> 21:05.764
some new sides of yourself
recently, but I--

21:05.831 --> 21:09.468
I'm sorry, is there a way
we cannot have this talk

21:09.534 --> 21:10.636
next to the wall?

21:10.702 --> 21:14.806
Oh...

21:10.702 --> 21:14.806
Thank you.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.875
All right,
I've tried being supportive

21:16.942 --> 21:18.543
when you said you
were now clubbing,

21:18.610 --> 21:22.881
and then also the implying
that you have sex with people

21:22.948 --> 21:24.449
outside of your relationship.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.618
Well...

21:24.516 --> 21:26.618
I have tried not to be judgey.

21:26.685 --> 21:29.254
Thank you.

21:26.685 --> 21:29.254
But yesterday,

21:29.321 --> 21:30.889
that was not great for me.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.724
I thought the barbeque
was wonderful.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.028
Yeah, it was, until you
told me you were on Ecstasy.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.729
Obviously,
you are a grown man,

21:37.796 --> 21:39.598
I am not gonna
tell you what to do,

21:39.665 --> 21:43.235
but in front of my child?

21:43.301 --> 21:45.470
That was not, not fun.

21:45.537 --> 21:47.072
You know what?

21:45.537 --> 21:47.072
What?

21:47.139 --> 21:51.643
You're right, it was a step
too far, even for me.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.311
Yes, it was.

21:53.378 --> 21:59.284
I appreciate you... taking
responsibility, though, for it.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.586
And I'm feeling really
badly about it today,

22:01.653 --> 22:03.355
but you know,
being old is hard.

22:03.422 --> 22:07.259
I know, but the alternative
is death, so...

22:07.325 --> 22:10.662
I don't want you to feel badly
about it-- well, a little bit--

22:10.729 --> 22:12.698
I just needed you
to know how I feel.

22:12.764 --> 22:14.299
It's impossible not to
feel that way...

22:14.366 --> 22:17.135
Well...

22:14.366 --> 22:17.135
...with Ecstasy, I mean,
Ecstasy itself is great,

22:17.202 --> 22:20.205
but it's the coming down,
oh, my Lord.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.640
That's your takeaway?

22:21.707 --> 22:23.241
They should put
a warning on that sucker.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.711
Yeah, I think the government
making it illegal

22:25.777 --> 22:27.245
was the warning.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.281
Yeah.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.281
Yeah, so...

22:29.347 --> 22:31.183
Are we agreeing no more
mind-altering drugs

22:31.249 --> 22:32.617
in front of your
granddaughter?

22:32.684 --> 22:35.120
Yeah, I promise.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.120
Thank you.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.155
Now, can you stay
for breakfast?

22:37.222 --> 22:40.125
No, I gotta go, um,
do some emails

22:40.192 --> 22:42.761
for Amelia's
kindergarten stuff.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.464
Oh, did you hear
where she got in?

22:45.530 --> 22:49.000
Yeah, Dad, you were on the phone
with me when it happened.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.602
I was?
Oh, that's scary.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.071
Okay, again, I really
can't stress this enough--

22:53.138 --> 22:55.741
we need to not be
doing Ecstasy.

22:57.008 --> 22:58.410
He did admit that
he went to far,

22:58.477 --> 23:00.579
which I'm not sure
I ever heard him saying.

23:00.645 --> 23:03.315
I think he was maybe still just
coming down from the Mollies,

23:03.381 --> 23:05.283
there was still
a touch of it in him.

23:05.350 --> 23:08.253
Ugh, I just can't wait
for this to be over.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.490
His life?

23:08.320 --> 23:11.490
Oh, Jesus, this phase!

23:11.556 --> 23:13.158
What is wrong with you?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.226
[phone ringtone]

23:14.292 --> 23:16.261
Oh, it's Brian.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.261
Oh, pick it up.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.597
You know what, I just
emailed him about Weston.

23:18.663 --> 23:19.865
Brian, you're on speaker.

23:19.931 --> 23:21.333
<i>Hey, Mike.</i>

23:19.931 --> 23:21.333
Hey.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.001
Hi!

23:21.399 --> 23:23.001
<i>Hi!</i>

23:23.068 --> 23:26.004
<i>Got your email, and I love</i>
<i>that idea about the kids</i>

23:26.071 --> 23:27.572
<i>doing the summer camp</i>
<i>together.</i>

23:27.639 --> 23:29.074
I know, I'm so excited.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.143
<i>Oh, by the way,</i>
<i>that picture is killing me.</i>

23:31.209 --> 23:33.678
What picture?

23:31.209 --> 23:33.678
<i>Stop, you're joking, right?</i>

23:33.745 --> 23:36.515
You stop, are you joking me?
What are you talking about?

23:36.581 --> 23:38.049
<i>The picture on the email?</i>

23:38.116 --> 23:40.152
<i>The picture that you put</i>
<i>as your signature?</i>

23:40.218 --> 23:41.987
[Mike]
Where is the last
email you sent?

23:42.053 --> 23:45.991
I only sent emails to Brian
and the kindergartens.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.894
Holy shit!

23:48.960 --> 23:51.563
[Mike]
Oh... oh, my God.

23:51.630 --> 23:52.964
<i>Oh, this is fun.</i>

23:53.031 --> 23:55.333
Brian, we'll call you back.

23:58.003 --> 24:01.306
Again, I'm so sorry.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.308
I, I do comedy
and I think somebody

24:03.375 --> 24:05.944
may have hacked
into my computer...

24:06.011 --> 24:08.914
thinking it as a joke,

24:08.980 --> 24:13.852
but we are still so excited to
be a part of the Weston family.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.588
Uh-huh.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.588
And clearly, the contents

24:16.655 --> 24:21.092
of that... particular photo
is by no means reflective

24:21.159 --> 24:25.497
of who we are, and we are
actively searching

24:25.564 --> 24:28.900
for the person who did this
because we are just as mad,

24:28.967 --> 24:32.270
if not more mad,
than you are.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.842
I am so sorry.
