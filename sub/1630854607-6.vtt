WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.627
<i>I solved the clue.</i>

00:02.627 --> 00:06.131
Sacagawea hid the clue to the treasure
in one of the expedition's journals.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.717
-<i>It says here the journal is on display--</i>
- <i>Is on display</i>

00:08.717 --> 00:11.011
at the Governor's mansion.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.888
<i>The bearded guy was here,
just across the street.</i>

00:13.888 --> 00:15.181
<i>Maybe it was that Salazar guy.</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:16.933
Billie really is still keeping tabs on us.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.810
Zoom in on her necklace.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.062
This changes everything.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.690
So, uh, you got any suspects yet?

00:23.690 --> 00:26.776
There's the grandson's girlfriend
who was the last person to see him alive.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.362
The last person to see a victim alive
is always a prime suspect.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.240
<i>Jess is going to that ball
to take a look at that journal.</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:33.366
Liam!

00:33.908 --> 00:34.993
Freeze!

00:35.285 --> 00:36.369
You stole the journal.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.788
Shame on all of y'all.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.914
- Ho, ho!
- Y'all need to leave.

00:43.877 --> 00:44.878
Get in.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.641
Did you have fun at the gala?

01:00.351 --> 01:03.104
It's never really a party
until the cops show up, is it?

01:03.104 --> 01:07.108
- How? Why did you--
- Why did I rescue you? Well...

01:07.108 --> 01:11.613
I was just arriving
and I saw you running out barefoot

01:11.613 --> 01:15.283
looking like a street urchin,
and I thought, huh,

01:15.283 --> 01:18.453
this is a good opportunity to tell you
that we got off on the wrong foot.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.996
On the wrong foot?

01:19.996 --> 01:22.248
Yeah, kidnapping someone's friend tends
to do that.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.501
Not my finest hour,

01:24.501 --> 01:26.669
but I did what I thought I had to do.

01:27.712 --> 01:31.174
Just like Rafael and I did

01:31.174 --> 01:34.636
when we embarked on this treasure hunt
20 years ago.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.637
Wait.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.473
You knew my father?

01:38.473 --> 01:39.516
Yes.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.185
And your mother, Manuela.

01:43.269 --> 01:46.064
And if I'd known they were your parents,

01:46.064 --> 01:47.607
I would have shown you this.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.571
You're a Daughter of the Plumed Serpent?

01:56.199 --> 01:57.117
Yes.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.123
We're on the same side, Jess.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.043
May I buy you dinner?

02:08.795 --> 02:10.672
Of course, we have
to get out of these gowns,

02:10.672 --> 02:12.507
put on some cocktail attire.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.388
I know this is a lot.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.767
I can take you home if you like.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.105
Or I can tell you everything I know.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.230
There's mad chatter everywhere

03:50.230 --> 03:52.607
about a priceless historical journal
being stolen.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.568
But zero arrests so far.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.695
That's good news, right?

03:57.695 --> 03:59.030
It means she outran everybody?

03:59.030 --> 04:00.490
Why isn't she picking up?

04:05.203 --> 04:06.454
See, she's fine.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.002
Oh, Ms. Pearce. Good evening.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.381
I have your usual table. Right this way.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.762
We have a wonderful meal prepared
for you tonight.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.721
Oh.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.439
Enjoy your evening.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.823
Last time I was here,
he tried to make me leave.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.783
Oh, that will never happen again.

04:46.744 --> 04:47.620
No, thank you.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.955
I don't really drink.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.832
It's a mojito mocktail.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.041
No alcohol.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.877
Isn't that your usual?

04:58.548 --> 04:59.882
So you know my drink order...

05:00.967 --> 05:02.719
my shoe and dress size...

05:03.636 --> 05:04.762
my birthstone.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.265
What can I say, when I dig, I dig deep.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.351
Can I see the medallion?

05:11.352 --> 05:12.603
Yes.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.404
I know what you're thinking.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.780
It's a fake.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.074
She bought it on the black market.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.035
You are an antiquities dealer.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.496
Ah, a fellow deep-digger.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.750
You're so much like your father.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.760
That's my dad.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.513
With my brother, Sebastian.

05:47.513 --> 05:51.559
Sebastian and I first met your father
just outside of Mexico City.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.186
We thought he was a treasure hunter,

05:53.186 --> 05:55.438
and he thought the same of us.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.149
But soon after,

05:58.691 --> 06:03.196
we realized that we were both looking
for the treasure to protect it.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.160
So... where's your brother now?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.622
He was murdered.

06:15.833 --> 06:16.834
Oh.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.130
We've both suffered loss.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.719
The same man who killed my brother
killed your father.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.972
A treasure hunter named Salazar.

06:30.973 --> 06:31.891
Salazar?

06:32.642 --> 06:35.395
I found a note warning me about Salazar.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.022
Oh, he's still out there
looking for this treasure.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.778
This medallion we both wear...

06:44.904 --> 06:46.114
is a promise.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.826
A duty to keep the treasure safe
from men like him.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.538
We can do this together, Jess.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.165
Not to mention

06:56.165 --> 06:59.001
validating your mother's life's work.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.588
What don't you know?

07:02.588 --> 07:07.427
Your mother was brilliant,
unjustly laughed out of academia.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.305
This can be your chance
to have the last laugh, Jess.

07:12.014 --> 07:16.269
Otherwise, your father
and my brother died for nothing.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.604
That's exactly what I was trying to do.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.277
But then Liam double-crossed me
and ran off with that journal.

07:25.403 --> 07:30.158
Liam has been working against you
for quite some time.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.079
He doesn't care about the treasure.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.831
He's only in it for the money.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.251
That's why he offered
to steal the journal for me.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.836
If I hadn't taken him up on his offer,

07:41.836 --> 07:43.963
he would have just sold it
to someone else.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.340
You have the journal?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.509
I have the journal.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.721
I have the resources.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.598
And with your skills,

07:53.598 --> 07:55.516
we can find the third relic

07:55.516 --> 07:58.478
and beat Salazar to the treasure.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.649
So...

08:05.026 --> 08:06.110
where's the journal?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.617
Thank you.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.329
I take it you travel a lot?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.831
I practically live on this.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.917
Hi, Jess. I'm Kacey.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.628
Not a real fed. I got that.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.670
Yeah, sorry about that.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.005
We were just trying to scare you guys.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.924
I'm really glad
that we're on the same team now.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.634
Yeah, me too.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.469
And this is Dario.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.388
Any hidden messages yet?

08:34.388 --> 08:35.556
So far no.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.934
Just a bunch of drawings and...

08:38.601 --> 08:39.560
a lot of tedious description

08:39.560 --> 08:42.522
on how Lewis's dog
liked to chase squirrels.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.232
Care to take a crack at it, Jess?

08:49.195 --> 08:52.823
So Lewis liked to draw
a lot of portraits of his dog.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.034
Oh, these weren't all drawn by Lewis.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.245
I thought you said it was Lewis's journal.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.705
Yes, but he didn't make every entry.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.500
Halfway through his expedition,

09:03.251 --> 09:05.211
he got shot in the butt
and couldn't sit and write anymore.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.128
Ouch.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.297
So what, he handed it off to Clark?

09:08.297 --> 09:09.298
Who hated journaling,

09:09.298 --> 09:12.134
which is why he passed the ball
to other members

09:12.134 --> 09:15.388
of the expedition like Sacagawea and York.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.727
This is the only entry written in French.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.104
Sacagawea spoke French.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.064
Maybe she taught herself how to write.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.697
"The twin-tongued serpent's tale
is revealed in fair weather...

09:35.324 --> 09:37.034
by the bend."

09:38.619 --> 09:41.539
Maybe it's not a bend in a river.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.001
- It's a bend in the strap.
- It's a bend in the strap.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.671
It's a broken word puzzle.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.799
Of course it's a broken word puzzle.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.385
The question is, um...

09:54.385 --> 09:56.178
...what is a broken word puzzle?

09:56.804 --> 09:58.389
Something puzzle geeks know.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.268
See these colored strings
around the strap?

10:03.227 --> 10:07.189
Blue, green, and white were
commonly used by Sacagawea's tribe.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.441
The Shoshone.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.405
If we line up the colors of the string...

10:14.405 --> 10:16.240
to the letters,

10:18.242 --> 10:20.119
we spell out...

10:22.330 --> 10:27.918
A, L, A, M, O, W, E, L, L.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.129
Alamo Well.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.799
That's where the third box is hidden.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.469
The well at the Alamo.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.888
Oh, tell me the Alamo has a well.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.848
It sure does.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.767
Oh, wait.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.685
The Alamo Mission was built
by the Spanish,

10:44.685 --> 10:46.937
which are the very people
that the Daughters of the Plumed Serpent

10:46.937 --> 10:48.230
were trying to hide the treasure from.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.315
That doesn't make any sense.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.651
It makes perfect sense.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.487
The indigenous people helped
build the Alamo, right?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.990
It eventually became one of the most
heavily guarded forts in the territory.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.285
It would be the last place the enemy knew
to look for the box...

11:01.744 --> 11:03.079
right under their own noses.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.121
I love it.

11:04.121 --> 11:08.042
I mean, the Spanish unknowingly
protecting the box

11:08.042 --> 11:09.502
for the Daughters of the Plumed Serpent.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.587
I mean, it's just genius.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.883
Okay, but nowadays,
the Alamo is a giant tourist trap.

11:15.883 --> 11:19.095
They're gonna frown on a few visitors
spelunking in their well.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.847
And how are we gonna find it
unless we remove every brick?

11:21.847 --> 11:23.057
With these.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.855
The Jade box.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.732
You have it.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.983
Yes, I do.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.986
Liam sold it to me.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.322
What?

11:38.322 --> 11:40.908
He told me it disappeared
when his dad died.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.076
Oh.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.161
I'm sorry.

11:45.621 --> 11:48.582
So, we have the Aztec
and the Mayan pieces of the map,

11:48.582 --> 11:52.628
and they are going to lead us
to the Incan piece.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.088
Because...

11:54.755 --> 11:58.551
if I turn these boxes
to face each other...

12:01.303 --> 12:02.346
They're magnets.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.807
Yes, magnetized lodestone.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.600
When we take these boxes to the Alamo,

12:06.600 --> 12:10.479
they're gonna be magnetically drawn
to where the third box is hidden.

12:10.479 --> 12:13.399
All we have to do now
is find our way into that well.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.484
We'll scout it tomorrow.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.946
And thank y'all for all your vibes.

12:19.405 --> 12:23.617
Your feedback on my gala protest
has reminded me exactly why I do this.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.829
I represent you, the people,

12:26.829 --> 12:29.039
and we're here to make change.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.916
If you see something, say something.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.293
It's what I live by.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.294
It...

12:34.211 --> 12:35.379
And I gotta go.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.882
Thank God.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.925
You're back. Jess, where have you been?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.260
Sorry, my phone died.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.434
I can't believe Liam stole that journal.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.437
Should've listened to you the first time.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.065
Well, listen to me now.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.401
Forget Liam. We don't need him.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.487
Forget him, forget his Clue Room,
forget the journal.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.696
We don't need any of that.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.448
Let's just plot our next move.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.408
We cannot let him beat us to the treasure.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.580
The same man who killed my brother
killed your father.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.625
A treasure hunter named Salazar.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.252
<i>He's still out there
looking for this treasure.</i>

13:17.004 --> 13:18.214
I think...

13:19.799 --> 13:20.966
from now on...

13:22.760 --> 13:24.345
I need to do this on my own.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.765
Excuse me.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.268
You would have been worse than arrested...

13:32.269 --> 13:33.354
if it weren't for me.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.438
I know.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.943
But I thought you were gonna get arrested
because of me.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.821
You took it way too far.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.949
Jess, you asked me for a diversion,

13:44.949 --> 13:46.867
and now you're criticizing me for it.

13:46.867 --> 13:51.580
I asked you to make a scene,
not cause a revolution.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.166
You didn't have to go full
Occupy Wall Street.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.584
You could have knocked over
a tray of food,

13:55.584 --> 13:57.294
but you chose to make it
about your agenda.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.671
Are you being serious right now?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.632
This is exactly why I didn't want you
to go to the ball in the first place.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.221
I am so done bailing you out.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.598
Jess, from now on, you're on your own.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.104
- Tasha.
- No.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.251
Good timing.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.086
I was just stalking social media
for signs of Jess.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.880
Jess is home and she is fine.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.548
Oh.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.300
Cool.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.844
What about Liam?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.846
I'm not here for you or treasure drama, Oren.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.474
I'd like to spend some quality time
with my girl Buffy.

14:54.935 --> 14:55.895
Wait.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.773
You're in a fight with someone
who isn't me.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.988
You're fighting with Jess,
and you did not come here at midnight

15:05.988 --> 15:07.990
to be with Buffy. Mm-mm.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.992
You came to talk to me.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.119
I'll be right back.

15:21.211 --> 15:24.590
You hate dark chocolate and peanut butter.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.176
But you love them,

15:28.093 --> 15:31.472
so... I keep them handy
in case you ever come over.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.477
Hm.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.386
I love you.

16:17.768 --> 16:21.355
<i>The same man who killed my brother
killed your father.</i>

16:21.355 --> 16:24.149
<i>A treasure hunter named Salazar.</i>

16:31.448 --> 16:32.950
<i>I'm not gonna fight you.</i>

16:36.954 --> 16:38.539
<i>You're my friend.</i>

16:45.254 --> 16:47.214
<i>You're my mission.</i>

16:47.673 --> 16:48.841
See?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.300
I mean, that's you and Jess.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.430
I'm afraid to ask
am I Cap or Bucky?

16:54.430 --> 16:55.764
Doesn't matter.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.307
It kind of does.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.310
Uh, Bucky just spent the last two hours
trying to kill Cap.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.647
That's my point, right?

17:03.647 --> 17:06.692
Steve and Bucky were BFFs.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.818
Right?

17:07.818 --> 17:12.031
Bucky dies and comes back
as a brainwashed murder machine

17:12.031 --> 17:14.658
who teams up with Hydra
to bring about the fall of democracy.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.327
Oh, don't forget the brutal slaying
of Tony Stark's parents.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.537
Right.

17:18.537 --> 17:22.750
But Steve... always has Bucky's back.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.171
"Till the end of the line."

17:28.005 --> 17:29.089
Exactly.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.218
Best friends don't give up on each other.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.180
You and Jess are gonna get through this.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.391
Just like Cap and Bucky.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.237

18:26.313 --> 18:27.981
Yeah, sorry, buddy.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.283
- Are you guys...
- Nope.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.409
Yes.

18:41.703 --> 18:42.746
Um...

18:43.455 --> 18:45.791
Yeah, uh, Tasha and Jess...

18:47.000 --> 18:48.377
they got into it last night.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.753
Wait, what?

18:49.753 --> 18:51.505
- Like they had a fight?
- Yeah.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.923
It was epic.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.341
Like Buck and Cap.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.288
I was just about to text
if you wanted coffee.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.207
- Great minds think alike.
- Thank you.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.127
What a night, huh?
Heard about you and Tasha.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.004
Yeah. Long list of crazy.

19:32.546 --> 19:36.008
Where do we start?
How about Liam stealing the journal?

19:36.008 --> 19:38.594
Tasha and Oren almost getting arrested.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.054
Your first DTR girlfriend
running out of the dance?

19:42.097 --> 19:44.600
Yeah, the dance.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.770
How's Meena?

19:50.731 --> 19:52.357
It's complicated.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.405
We should have never danced.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.409
We were there for the journal
and I got distracted.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.871
Tasha and Oren could have gotten arrested.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.374
I almost got arrested.

20:12.002 --> 20:15.172
I got caught up
in this Cinderella fairy tale

20:15.172 --> 20:16.924
and it turned out to be a nightmare.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.346
I'm such an idiot.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.223
Come on. No, you're not.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.225
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.976
You wanted to believe him.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.687
We all did.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.400
Have you talked to him yet?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.694
I've called and I've texted.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.571
He's not responding.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.742
Well, the Jess I know wouldn't take that.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.378
Liam?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.306
Come on. I know you're in here.

21:19.027 --> 21:19.945
Liam?

21:31.331 --> 21:32.499
Who would do this?

21:39.589 --> 21:43.051
I won't let you find the treasure.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.054
Let her go!

21:57.858 --> 21:58.942
Are you okay?

22:00.068 --> 22:01.236
I think so.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.831
Of course, Peter Sadusky
has a secret Clue Room.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.083
He took everything.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.628
Was that guy Salazar?

22:19.546 --> 22:20.464
No.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.549
But he works for him.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.886
He's been following us for a while now.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.516
Wait, why are you here?

22:32.351 --> 22:33.643
Were you following me?

22:33.643 --> 22:34.853
Billie was worried about you.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.897
She wanted me to watch your back.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.693
Look, I get it.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.946
You still have your doubts about Billie,
but she is not the bad guy.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.407
Jess, she never was.

22:47.991 --> 22:51.620
She's just very hard to get to know.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.914
And she has had a very hard life.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.166
Doesn't seem like it.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.834
Her and her brother...

22:58.919 --> 23:01.213
were orphaned when they were kids.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.591
Their parents were killed by a car bomb.

23:05.092 --> 23:10.389
And after her brother was murdered,
she lost everyone that she loved.

23:11.848 --> 23:15.227
Now her only family are her employees.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.773
I was on the streets,

23:20.357 --> 23:21.858
stealing purses.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.736
And Billie took me in.

23:25.862 --> 23:29.408
She paid for my education,
she gave me a job.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.370
This woman saved my life.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.250
And you just saved mine.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.836
Thank you.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.012
Are you sure it was him?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.140
He grew a beard
and looked a little worse for wear,

23:53.140 --> 23:54.433
but it was definitely Maddox.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.352
Well, if Maddox is around,
that means Salazar is not far behind.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.813
- We have to move fast.
- Yeah, on it.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.318
You think Sadusky was murdered
for a clue to a treasure?

24:05.318 --> 24:07.070
I know it sounds crazy, but...

24:07.070 --> 24:11.199
Okay, look, these are screenshots from
the security footage from the USS Kidd.

24:11.908 --> 24:15.579
I mean, I... I think Jess Valenzuela
was telling the truth.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.080
I mean, she said she was talking
to a woman,

24:17.080 --> 24:18.498
she said her name was Billie.

24:18.498 --> 24:19.875
Yeah. I can't make out
any of those faces.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.668
Yeah, I'm having OTD enhance
all the footage.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.463
I've got to figure out
who the Billie person is.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.300
And, uh... Elvis?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.760
Oh, uh, yeah.
There was a break-in at Graceland.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.597
The perps sounded a lot
like Valenzuela and her friends.

24:33.597 --> 24:37.184
Also get this, Sadusky and Elvis,
both Masons.

24:39.227 --> 24:43.315
Is this, uh, some sort of a, a weird
first coffee date test thing?

24:48.695 --> 24:49.946
No.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.364
Good.

24:51.364 --> 24:54.242
'Cause you're not gonna chase me off
with that crazy Elvis story.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.286
'Cause I love the King.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.584
Uh, the orange dye you found
on Sadusky's hand.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.002
What'd you find out about this?

25:06.505 --> 25:08.965
Nothing in Sadusky's
medicine cabinet matched.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.967
I asked the FDA
for a list of all food and drugs

25:10.967 --> 25:12.552
that match orange dye number 47.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.346
But I mean, it would go a lot quicker

25:14.346 --> 25:16.431
if you called some
of your old DC contacts.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.309
That's not really an option.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.064
Look...

25:25.190 --> 25:26.441
I know what went down.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.026
You made a bad arrest,

25:28.026 --> 25:30.487
but that happens, right?

25:30.487 --> 25:33.365
What matters is they eventually caught
the right guy.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.825
But not before he killed again.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.580
Sorry, I didn't, I didn't know that.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.791
They left that part out
with the official report.

25:43.458 --> 25:46.086
Made the whole division look bad,
but, yeah...

25:47.379 --> 25:48.463
that was all me.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.925
Well, uh...

25:51.925 --> 25:53.843
...since we're opening up on this...

25:54.719 --> 25:56.221
Yeah, well, coffee date...

25:58.473 --> 26:01.434
There's a reason why I'm a coroner
and not a surgeon.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.145
All right, well, unless you've killed
someone on the table,

26:04.145 --> 26:05.647
it's not gonna make me feel better.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.029
I'm sorry.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.157
Do you feel better now?

26:19.160 --> 26:20.245
No.

26:21.830 --> 26:22.914
Me neither.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.844
Welcome to the Alamo.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.596
<i>South station, clear.</i>

26:38.930 --> 26:40.307
Those Rangers have guns.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.809
And these tourists have phones.
We gotta watch out for both.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.519
<i>A couple more war bodies
in the plaza.</i>

26:44.519 --> 26:45.937
Okay, so,

26:45.937 --> 26:49.399
we have an iron grate
that looks pretty unliftable.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.484
Mm. A rope pulley should do the job.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.487
We're also gonna need tools
to chisel out the bricks.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.364
We have a handheld jackhammer we can use.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.949
A jackhammer?

26:57.949 --> 27:00.160
These bricks are over 200 years old.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.369
We don't want to damage them.

27:01.369 --> 27:04.331
Please bring something more delicate, Kacey.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.666
All right. If we do this after hours,

27:06.666 --> 27:09.502
we're still gonna have these
armed rangers to deal with.

27:12.339 --> 27:15.967
Don't worry. Davy Crockett will get us in.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.598
Who doesn't like playing dress-up?

27:21.598 --> 27:23.016
I'm not following.

27:23.808 --> 27:27.312
They do reenactments of The Battle
of the Alamo every Tuesday and Friday.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.855
If my history is correct,

27:28.855 --> 27:31.191
the battle starts outside
and the courtyard will be empty.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.109
Okay.

27:33.693 --> 27:34.819
Let me check.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.530
Oh, thank you. Right there.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.407
You're right.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.160
It says here the first phase
of the reenactment starts outside

27:42.160 --> 27:43.495
and lasts 10 minutes.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.831
That should be more than enough time
to get in and out of the well.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.541
I'm gonna get us reenactor costumes.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.752
We're not gonna need this anymore.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.212
She's right. You know,
you should make sure

27:52.212 --> 27:54.297
that makes its way back
to the governor's mansion.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.840
Absolutely.

27:59.594 --> 28:00.804

29:13.501 --> 29:14.502
You know what hurt?

29:15.336 --> 29:17.464
Thinking you actually liked golf.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.050
I want someone who...

29:21.509 --> 29:23.344
who plays golf with me and loves it.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.015
Or at the very least tells me he hates it.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.728
I hate golf.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.441
Actually, golf hates me.

29:37.734 --> 29:38.651
Good.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.111
Tell that to the next girl.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.032
Or not, um...

29:44.866 --> 29:46.075
Jess already knows.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.996
Meena, I swear I wasn't lying to you, I...

29:53.500 --> 29:54.834
I was lying to myself.

29:58.254 --> 30:00.715
I'm glad I found out now
and not on our Hawaiian honeymoon.

30:04.427 --> 30:05.929
I hate the beach.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.515
I'm gonna say it.
I... There's, there's too much sand.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.434
- It's everywhere.
- Yes. Honesty. Progress.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.853
But hating on the beach?
Total dealbreaker.

30:14.687 --> 30:15.772
Mm.

30:15.772 --> 30:17.315
No.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.994
I'm sorry.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.164
Where is the patient who was wearing this?

30:54.185 --> 30:55.937
First time flying private?

30:56.771 --> 30:58.398
First time flying.

31:03.027 --> 31:05.196
That looks like
it should probably be in a museum.

31:05.905 --> 31:06.990
Me or the sword?

31:09.158 --> 31:10.827
No, it's a replica.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.957
A replica of the sword of Hernán Cortés.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.210
That's like having
Darth Vader's lightsaber.

31:19.210 --> 31:22.255
Just a reminder
of all the atrocities

31:22.255 --> 31:26.467
he and his conquistadors made against
the Daughters of the Plumed Serpent...

31:26.467 --> 31:28.469
and all their people.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.558
I wish my mom were here to see this.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.393
Yeah.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.478
Me too.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.731
We were good friends.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.359
She was...

31:44.903 --> 31:46.029
so smart.

31:48.489 --> 31:49.574
She was just kind.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.700
Yeah.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.203
Unless you rooted against
the Mexican National Soccer Team.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.331
Yes.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.334
She was passionate about her soccer.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.585
If by "passionate,"

32:00.585 --> 32:02.962
you mean painting her face
for every World Cup match.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.590
Okay.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.592
- Are you ready to go over the plan?
- Yes.

32:08.134 --> 32:11.179
Okay, I have watched dozens
of these reenactments.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.057
Phase one we know lasts ten minutes.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.142
That's when we go into the well
and we get the box.

32:16.142 --> 32:19.520
When phase two starts,
the battle is gonna move inside

32:19.520 --> 32:21.731
and we're gonna use this to our advantage.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.107
We're gonna blend in

32:23.107 --> 32:24.734
and then we're gonna slip out.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.945
Do we have a backup plan
in case something goes wrong?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.905
I never leave home without one.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.699
We land in less than 20 minutes.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.369
Let's step back in time.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.037

33:19.372 --> 33:20.623
Sorry, ladies,

33:20.623 --> 33:23.668
the reenactment starts outside
in the corner of Alamo and Houston Street.

33:23.668 --> 33:24.752
The battle doesn't breach the wall--

33:25.503 --> 33:27.588
Don't worry, it's only a tranq gun.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.465
Bad dreams at worst. He's not dead.

33:29.465 --> 33:30.717
And wait.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.510
Now.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.180
- Attack!
- Get them, boys!

33:40.768 --> 33:42.520
Right on time.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.647
Okay.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.859
This place is the beginning of when
Mexico lost Texas to the United States.

33:47.859 --> 33:48.776
I know.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.069
And when we find that treasure,

33:50.069 --> 33:53.239
we will restore glory
to all indigenous people.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.657
Kacey, why don't you get out there

33:54.657 --> 33:56.784
and make sure none of those tourists
goes off-script?

34:15.470 --> 34:16.387
Hey.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.643
- Ethan.
- Yeah.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.188
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.439
Take it easy.

34:26.439 --> 34:29.150
You have a couple of bruised ribs
and signs of a concussion.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.447
I, I need to call Jess.

34:35.656 --> 34:36.783
Where's my phone?

34:36.783 --> 34:39.952
I, I don't know, but you're probably
not gonna get through.

34:39.952 --> 34:43.289
I've been calling her all morning
and it's just going straight to voicemail.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.874
Her battery's probably dead.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.086
Her battery's not dead.

34:50.296 --> 34:51.380
It's Billie.

34:52.048 --> 34:52.965
What?

34:52.965 --> 34:54.634
Billie came to the ball.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.386
I saw her arriving.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.722
Look, I had no choice.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.434
You guys were dancing.

35:04.727 --> 35:07.772
I had to get that journal out of there
so Billie couldn't see it.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.149
So I took it.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.486
Oh, when...

35:13.486 --> 35:16.114
Oh, when I got outside...

35:21.285 --> 35:22.453
Somebody jumped me.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.165
He...

35:28.918 --> 35:31.170
She kicked my ass.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.675
And dumped me in the river.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.389
Last thing I remember was sinking
to the bottom.

35:44.892 --> 35:46.060
I should be dead.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.193
We need to find Jess.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.157
It's not there.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.410
- What do you mean?
- I checked every square inch.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.370
The boxes didn't point to anything.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.247
The battle will be coming in here soon.
We gotta get out.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.165
No, no.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.291
No, no, no, wait.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.168
It has to be down there.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.512
This is like Comic-Con for history nerds.

36:21.512 --> 36:25.766
Except everyone looks the same
and I can't find Jess.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.562
Yeah, maybe she's not here?

36:30.313 --> 36:32.148
No, she's gotta be here.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.274
Someone must've beat us to it.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.152
- Give me the satchel.
- We don't have time.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.362
I said give me the satchel,
I want to see it for myself!

36:38.362 --> 36:39.822
I want the boxes.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.534
I'm telling you, it's not there.

36:43.659 --> 36:45.077
I need to see for myself.

36:45.077 --> 36:45.995
Fire!

37:00.760 --> 37:01.802
Jess!

37:04.305 --> 37:06.974
We breached the wall. Go!

37:22.949 --> 37:24.659
- <i>Yeah, boss.</i>
- She's got the boxes!

37:24.659 --> 37:25.826
On it.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.126
<i>Rabbit on the run.</i>

37:40.549 --> 37:41.801
Sorry, sorry.

37:41.801 --> 37:42.760
Hey.

37:46.889 --> 37:47.765
There she is!

37:50.476 --> 37:51.352
- Jess!
- Wait...

37:51.352 --> 37:53.145
You cannot beat those... Tasha!

37:53.145 --> 37:54.605
Get that satchel!

38:02.154 --> 38:03.406
Long live Mexico!

38:04.365 --> 38:05.992
Long live Mexico!

38:07.076 --> 38:09.453
Long live Mexico!

38:23.467 --> 38:25.303
Jess. It's this way.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.554
Let's go!

38:29.432 --> 38:31.309
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.

38:37.815 --> 38:38.983
Get in! Get in! Get in!

38:38.983 --> 38:40.693
Drive! Drive! Drive!

38:40.693 --> 38:42.153
There's a horse!

38:42.153 --> 38:44.488
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

38:44.488 --> 38:45.865
No!

38:48.993 --> 38:51.954
Go, go, go, go, go.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.332
Go! Let's go!

38:56.459 --> 38:59.587
I, for one, will never forget the Alamo.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.339
Okay, everyone. Here. Phones in the bag.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.551
It's a Faraday bag.

39:05.551 --> 39:08.054
Blocks our cell signals
so Billie can't track us.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.808
- How did you track me?
- I got your letter.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.894
The one that said not to follow me.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.979
You should have cleared
your browser history

39:16.979 --> 39:18.647
'cause, boy, did it remember the Alamo.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.983
Jess, what were you thinking trying to do
this without me?

39:21.817 --> 39:23.652
I don't wanna keep
dragging you down with me.

39:24.278 --> 39:27.239
So that's why you started the argument.
It was on purpose.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.408
I didn't mean a word I said.

39:30.409 --> 39:31.327
I know.

39:33.954 --> 39:34.872
So, what's in the bag?

39:43.506 --> 39:44.882
So let me get this straight.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.968
You got to fly in Billie's private jet?

39:51.597 --> 39:53.724
Jess is living out my dream life.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.060
Billie pulling that family pic out
was low.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.104
Actually, that's how I knew she was lying.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.898
The buttons on my dad's shirt
were on the wrong side.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.528
<i>I noticed my dad's shirt buttons
were flipped,</i>

40:05.528 --> 40:09.073
<i>so that's how I knew
the image was photoshopped.</i>

40:09.073 --> 40:11.200
<i>Men's shirts all have buttons
on the right.</i>

40:11.867 --> 40:13.452
<i>Women's shirt buttons are all on the left.</i>

40:13.452 --> 40:14.537
What?

40:15.121 --> 40:16.080
Why?

40:16.080 --> 40:17.915
Because, um, fashion?

40:17.915 --> 40:20.126
Actually, it's because most people
are right-handed.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.711
So getting dressed is even easier for men.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.171
Seriously?

40:24.755 --> 40:28.467
Okay, what about Billie's secret
society necklace that matched yours?

40:28.801 --> 40:30.177
Could have been a fake.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.887
Either way, it's all pretty thin.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.974
Yeah. That's why I had to test the theory.

40:35.599 --> 40:36.600
Science.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.562
On the plane, I brought up
how much my mom loved soccer.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.522
Your mom hated soccer.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.649
Billie didn't know that.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.986
Oh. Ah. You sneaky B.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.573
Wait, so the entire time
Billie was trying to catfish you,

40:50.573 --> 40:52.158
you were catfishing her.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.202
Okay.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.370
We just poked the bear.

40:56.370 --> 40:58.497
We have to watch our backs.
Billie will show no mercy.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.040
I know.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.043
That's exactly why I didn't want you guys
to get involved.

41:03.043 --> 41:03.961
Hey.

41:04.587 --> 41:05.629
We're in.

41:09.091 --> 41:11.844
So if that third box isn't at the Alamo,
where is it?

41:11.844 --> 41:13.762
Oh, it's at the Alamo.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.389
Alamo, Mexico.

41:15.389 --> 41:19.226
There's this Mexican town called Viesca
that used to be called "Alamo".

41:19.226 --> 41:21.020
There must have also been a well.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.021
Yeah.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.440
Well, then let's figure out
if it's still there.

41:27.693 --> 41:28.861
That guy?

41:29.653 --> 41:32.031
He's clearly drunk.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.659
So you'll take his word over mine?
I can't believe this.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.301
Have you got the package?

41:53.010 --> 41:53.844
Yeah.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.055
It's ready.

41:56.931 --> 41:58.849
<i>It's time to deliver it.</i>

41:58.849 --> 41:59.934
Will do.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.273
<i>On the surveillance footage,
there was a woman.</i>

42:06.273 --> 42:09.276
Blonde hair, about 5'8", well-dressed.

42:09.276 --> 42:10.694
She was stopped by an MP.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.279
Did that man by chance get her name?

42:14.782 --> 42:15.908
Thanks.

42:16.742 --> 42:18.077
For nothing?

42:18.077 --> 42:19.495
Agent Ross.

42:19.495 --> 42:21.830
Hi, I'm Myles. We met at, uh...

42:21.830 --> 42:23.707
Peter Sadusky's wake, right.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.334
Um, I remember you were his nurse.

42:25.334 --> 42:26.418
Yeah.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.504
That is actually what I need
to talk to you about.

42:28.921 --> 42:29.838
Um...

42:29.838 --> 42:32.466
Mr. Sadusky's grandson is paying me
to clean out his study.

42:32.466 --> 42:33.717
- Mm.
- And...

42:35.052 --> 42:37.388
Well, I found this.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.306
What is it?

42:39.306 --> 42:40.683
It's a recording.

42:41.433 --> 42:45.229
Mr. Sadusky was a paranoid man
and he recorded everything.

42:47.773 --> 42:50.025
I think Jess Valenzuela murdered him.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.535
So y'all want the good news
or the terrible news?

42:59.535 --> 43:02.454
We're just skipping past bad
and going straight to terrible?

43:02.454 --> 43:05.040
Well, the good news is Viesca
does check out right down to a well,

43:05.040 --> 43:06.458
in the center of town.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.294
And the terrible news?

43:08.919 --> 43:12.172
Well, in the 1920s, the area was developed

43:12.172 --> 43:14.717
and a bank was built over the land.

43:15.801 --> 43:19.471
So we'd have to rob a bank
to get to the well.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.182
I have very mixed feelings about that.

43:23.767 --> 43:25.436
That is pretty terrible.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.271
Well, actually, that's just the bad news.

43:27.855 --> 43:30.524
Twenty years ago,
someone broke into the bank vault

43:30.524 --> 43:32.109
and blew a hole into the floor,

43:32.109 --> 43:34.445
- which revealed--
- The well.

43:36.155 --> 43:38.198
The bank robber
was on the treasure hunt too.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.034
Which finally brings us to more news,

43:40.034 --> 43:42.953
and I don't know if it's good
or bad or what,

43:42.953 --> 43:46.582
but they caught the guy
and he's still in prison.

43:47.207 --> 43:50.586
And his name is Diego Salazar.

43:52.838 --> 43:56.216
As in "Beware of Salazar" Salazar?

43:58.594 --> 43:59.803
I have to go talk to him.

44:01.013 --> 44:04.308
Well, maybe you missed the part
where he's in jail.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.809
In Mexico.

44:06.393 --> 44:09.104
Salazar is the only one that knows
what happened to that box.

44:09.104 --> 44:10.314
You don't know that for sure, Jess.

44:10.314 --> 44:13.025
And why would you risk going to Mexico
for that?

44:13.025 --> 44:15.069
Salazar killed my dad.

44:18.947 --> 44:21.367
Why is this the first I'm hearing of this?

44:23.619 --> 44:25.704
I just found out from Billie.

44:27.247 --> 44:28.290
Billie?

44:28.707 --> 44:30.250
Catfish Queen?

44:30.834 --> 44:32.795
- She told you and you believed her?
- Yeah.

44:33.921 --> 44:34.922
No.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.884
It makes sense.
Why else would my mom have that note?

44:40.344 --> 44:42.554
Okay, right now,
I don't know what to believe.

44:43.263 --> 44:46.100
But all I know is that Salazar is the key
to figuring it all out.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.351
Jess.

44:47.351 --> 44:51.730
Um, as previously stated,
that would require going to Mexico.

44:52.314 --> 44:54.566
And you can never come back.

44:56.235 --> 44:57.653
My bag's already packed.
