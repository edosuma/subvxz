02:25.240 --> 02:28.391
Bad news, Mr. D'Arcy.
l'm afraid we're gonna have to operate.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.636
-You do have insurance, don't you?
-Yes.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.195
Well, then we will be
using anaesthesia.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.030
And how are we today, Mr. O'Malley?

02:38.080 --> 02:39.479
My heart hurts.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.551
Good, good.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.632
Tack on another grand
for the consultation.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.478
Thank you.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.798
Hey!

02:54.520 --> 02:56.112
They can get away with anything...

02:56.320 --> 02:59.517
...just because they changed
their first name to ''doctor.''

03:01.040 --> 03:03.713
Man, when you lose your looks....

03:06.000 --> 03:08.309
Hi, Mr. D'Arcy.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.718
Wow, you look.... You look great.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.756
Remind me on the way home
to pick up a black dress, okay?

03:22.400 --> 03:24.152
Kelly.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.951
Hey, Mr. D'Arcy. You look great.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.794
Well, compared to that guy.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.869
Hey, you guys.
Thanks for coming by.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.680
Where's your dad
and the rest of my buddies?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.350
They wanted to come,
but there was an emergency.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.034
l thought they said
there was a game on.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.314
There was an emergency game.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.715
lt just broke out.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.391
But they did send some candy.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.158
Oh, where is it?

03:57.320 --> 04:00.118
lt melted on the way over here.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.271
Yeah, in our stomachs.

04:02.520 --> 04:03.748
-Later, man.
-See you.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.997
Hey, don't you guys
wanna know how l got here?

04:07.840 --> 04:10.354
You promised we wouldn't
have to talk to him.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.919
lt all started on the day
of my anniversary.

04:15.160 --> 04:19.153
Al and the guys were having a
special NO MA'AM breakfast meeting.

04:19.360 --> 04:24.798
Oh, Froot Loops and beer,
the breakfast of champions.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.956
Don't you know that breakfast is
the most important meal of the day?

04:29.160 --> 04:31.355
So just Fruit Loops for you?

04:32.080 --> 04:35.356
No. Just beer.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.715
Focus! Focus, gentlemen, focus.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.838
We are here
on an important mission.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.196
To save our brother, D'Arcy...

04:46.440 --> 04:50.115
...from the fire-breathing,
lipless beak of his wife...

04:51.040 --> 04:53.998
...on the day when all married men
need their friends the most:

04:54.240 --> 04:56.310
Their wedding anniversary.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.870
Brother Dan, has code name
KFC flown the coop yet?

05:03.600 --> 05:06.068
No, but she's headed
for the living room.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.630
Let's hope there's a man left to
rescue after Marcie's done with him.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.317
Don't be ridiculous. Jefferson may look
like a pretty boy, but he's all man.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.077
Oh, Lance, how I've longed for you.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.675
Don't do it, Lance.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.154
She's really your sister.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.791
Jefferson, did you make me coffee?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.470
Yes, dear.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.988
Oh, a 3:00 job interview?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.037
Fine.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.230
Could you hold on?
l got another call.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.590
Give me that.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.959
You know what day it is today?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.478
Today?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.272
Of course, it's your--

06:06.080 --> 06:07.911
lt's my--

06:08.720 --> 06:10.551
lt's our?

06:10.960 --> 06:13.030
lt's our....

06:13.280 --> 06:16.670
What could we possibly
have in common?

06:18.600 --> 06:22.195
lt's our anniversary,
you soap-addicted wastrel.

06:22.440 --> 06:27.036
Oh, Marcie, l was gonna surprise you,
but now you've ruined it. l--

06:28.320 --> 06:31.198
Don't talk. Just listen.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.799
l'll go to work.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.996
Then l'll come home.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.239
l'll set the table...

06:38.480 --> 06:40.436
...l'll cook the dinner...

06:40.720 --> 06:44.759
...and tonight in bed,
l'll even do all the work.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.793
All you have to do is look pretty...

06:51.640 --> 06:55.428
...smell nice and stay away from Al...

06:55.640 --> 06:58.313
...and those NO MA'AM idiots.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.076
Marcie, why can't l play with Al?

07:05.760 --> 07:07.830
lt's my anniversary too.

07:08.080 --> 07:13.552
Look, l am tired of spending my
anniversary bailing you out of jail.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.712
Now, you just shower and shave...

07:16.960 --> 07:20.839
...and be here when l get home at 7.

07:25.160 --> 07:29.358
-Jefferson.
-Hey, hey, hey.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.551
Look, no, l know why
you guys are here...

07:31.800 --> 07:34.439
...and whatever it is,
l just can't do it, okay?

07:34.680 --> 07:36.398
l promised Marcie
l would stay home...

07:36.640 --> 07:39.791
...and there's nothing you can say
to make me go back on that promise.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.999
But it's foreign-exchange day
at the Jiggly Room.

07:45.440 --> 07:50.389
Featuring hooters from our sister city,
Chihuahua, Mexico.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.950
-Hey, why aren't you guys at work?
-We're sick.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.988
Except for me, l'm working.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.038
The mayor has been tak en hostage.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.555
All available units--

08:06.360 --> 08:08.157
Come on, let's go to the nudie bar.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.871
No, no, no. Look, l just--
l can't do it, it's my anniversary.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.190
Well, we know that.
That's our gift to you.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.519
Yeah. And guess who
the featured dancer is.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.069
Miss Sierra Madre.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.835
Sixty-three triple-K.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.392
Come on, Jefferson.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.359
lt's just us, some liquor
and a bunch of Mexican strippers.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.073
What could happen?

08:34.120 --> 08:39.477
Well, you put it that way, okay.
Hey, but l have to be back by 7.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.155
Well, that only gives us nine hours.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.277
Arriba!

08:46.720 --> 08:48.995
So the point is,
they practically forced me to go.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.879
Hey, where are you guys going?

08:55.760 --> 08:58.832
That was such a good ending,
we thought you were finished.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.234
Heck, no. l was just getting started.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.392
Nurse, l need a Q-Tip and a hammer.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.878
Just pinch that tube,
he'll fall right asleep.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.398
Cool.

09:23.440 --> 09:27.319
So l went with Al and the guys
to the nudie bar with...

09:27.560 --> 09:29.152
...only the best of intentions.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.631
Each and every one of us
was a perfect gentleman.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.193
Oh, baby.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.477
Hey, l'm a village person.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.313
Mr. D'Arcy...

09:58.600 --> 10:02.718
...should l continue to charge the lap
dances on your wife's credit card?

10:03.600 --> 10:06.717
Sure, it's her anniversary too.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.514
Oh, and have one yourself, lqbal.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.719
One thousand thank-yous.
And dollars.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.913
Jefferson, you told me
to tell you when it's 6:00.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.515
Thanks, Al. When is it?

10:19.760 --> 10:22.672
About a half-hour ago.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.999
-l gotta get home.
-l was about to take you there.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.471
Oh, yeah, right. l gotta get
to my home away from here.

10:39.080 --> 10:43.392
l still have to get a present for....
What day is it?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.750
All chicken's eve?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.991
Yeah. No.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.078
Marcie's birth-a-versary.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.073
Oh, man, what am l gonna do?

10:55.600 --> 10:59.070
Everybody, huddle up, huddle up.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.197
All right, fellas, when one of us
is in need, what do we do?

11:04.440 --> 11:07.796
Try to help him out and in so doing
we make things worse.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.150
Exactly. But now we need to think of
an anniversary present.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.998
Any ideas?

11:14.240 --> 11:19.109
Hey, you know,
lingerie is always nice.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.715
This is for Jefferson's wife?

11:22.480 --> 11:24.152
Yeah....

11:25.200 --> 11:27.714
Al, what did you get Peggy
for your anniversary?

11:27.960 --> 11:29.279
Well, it depends on the year.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.069
The first year is paper,
so l put a big bag over her head.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.520
l can't wait for the
plastic anniversary.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.077
-l just had a thought!
-What?

11:42.640 --> 11:44.870
Why don't you get a tattoo?

11:45.080 --> 11:48.436
l had my boyfriend's name
tattooed on me...

11:48.680 --> 11:50.511
...for his birthday.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.194
-l don't see no tattoo.
-Oh, no?

11:55.440 --> 11:57.590
lt's right here.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.752
Oh, man, l'd love
to be her boyfriend.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.757
l'd love to be her boyfriend's name.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.999
All right, fellas, break. Break it up.

12:12.240 --> 12:15.152
-Jefferson, you gotta get one of those.
-Oh, l don't know, Al.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.555
lt's hard enough that Marcie
has to support me.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.952
-Having another mouth to feed....
-Not the girl, you beer nut!

12:22.160 --> 12:23.798
l'm talking about a tattoo.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.279
Yeah. Yeah, l mean,
what could be more romantic...

12:27.520 --> 12:30.830
...than having a woman's name etched
into your arm by an accomplished...

12:31.040 --> 12:34.476
-...body illustrator?
-ls there a tattoo artist in the house?

12:38.480 --> 12:40.948
Harris, of course.
This is your lucky day, Jefferson.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.156
Harris can do this for you.

12:47.080 --> 12:50.231
Shake it, baby, shake it!

12:59.120 --> 13:01.315
Well, Jefferson, how'd it go?

13:01.560 --> 13:03.118
Great. l got my tattoo...

13:03.320 --> 13:07.393
...and Harris passed out right after,
so l didn't even have to pay him.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.716
-Yeah, let's see it.
-Let's see it, come on.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.632
-Wanna see it?
-Let's see it, come on.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.751
-Nothing there.
-Okay.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.837
That's blank, man.

13:18.600 --> 13:22.434
-Maybe l didn't get a tattoo.
-Oh, man.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.918
l got one.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.037
All right, Jefferson, drop trou.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.232
-Hang two.
-Here we go, come on.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.433
Marcie's gonna love this.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.395
l don't know, Jefferson.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.394
l think he left out the C.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.760
What are you talking about?

13:48.240 --> 13:50.435
l hate to tell you this, buddy...

13:51.960 --> 13:53.712
...but you might be married
to Marcie...

13:53.920 --> 13:58.232
...but your ass says '' l love Mary.''

14:22.840 --> 14:28.278
So the tattoo on my butt said
'' l love M-A-R-Y.''

14:28.720 --> 14:32.030
So, what's the problem?
M-A-R-Y, Marcy.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.271
There's a C in Marcie.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.513
M-A-R-Y-C?

14:40.800 --> 14:45.476
Oh, oh, yeah, the C is silent, right.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.838
That's it. l'm gone.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.549
-Shouldn't we do something?
-Yeah, you're absolutely right.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.197
So there l was with '' Mary''
tattooed on my rump...

15:09.400 --> 15:11.994
...and Harris was too drunk
to repair the damage.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.151
And l had to get home to Marcie.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.830
Then Al said if l could
stall Marcie for a while...

15:18.040 --> 15:20.474
...maybe he could come up
with a good plan.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.756
And he almost did.

15:31.040 --> 15:35.636
Honey, come on. Dinner is served.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.358
Jefferson...

15:46.600 --> 15:50.718
...sweetheart, exactly how many
pairs of pants are you wearing?

15:52.520 --> 15:54.511
Exactly three.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.315
-Why?
-Well, because...

15:57.520 --> 16:02.548
...the third anniversary
is the pants anniversary.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.191
lt's our fifth.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.196
Well, l'm also wearing
two pairs of underwear.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.109
What is going on?

16:14.440 --> 16:18.353
All right, Marcie,
l'll be honest with you.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.516
l was looking forward
to a little game of...

16:20.800 --> 16:23.633
...strip poker later...

16:25.360 --> 16:27.715
...and l intend to win.

16:29.280 --> 16:34.115
ln that case, let's just skip dinner
and shuffle the cards.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.430
Baby, you're trembling.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.350
Come on, take me on the
veal scaloppine right now.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.028
Hang on. No. No.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.759
No, not after you've...

16:50.000 --> 16:52.798
...gone to all this trouble.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.630
There you go, Mary.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.150
What'd you call me?

17:03.760 --> 17:04.875
Mary.

17:05.079 --> 17:08.435
lt's my secret little pet name for you.

17:08.680 --> 17:14.232
l mean, Marcie's gotta be
long for something like Mary.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.869
l hate the name Mary.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.111
Now sit down and eat.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.877
l think l'll eat standing.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.231
Why?

17:28.560 --> 17:29.879
Because...

17:30.160 --> 17:33.755
...l find the top
of your head so beautiful.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.830
That and the name Mary are my
two favourite things about you.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.750
Jefferson, sit.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.872
Yes, dear.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.558
Honey, why are you down there?

17:53.040 --> 17:54.598
Because...

17:54.800 --> 17:56.950
...l worship you.

17:58.640 --> 18:03.316
Jefferson, eat your dinner now.
Save your knees for later.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.071
Yes, dear.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.709
This looks great.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.359
Hurry up and eat your dinner...

18:20.560 --> 18:22.915
...because afterwards we can
go upstairs and have...

18:23.120 --> 18:24.951
...dessert.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.236
Oh, boy.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.310
Jefferson, enough.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.158
Bed, now.

18:56.560 --> 19:03.113
Marcie, it's healthy to chew
every bite of food 2500 times.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.589
-One. Two.
-Look...

19:06.840 --> 19:09.354
-Three.
-...l am going upstairs to get ready.

19:09.600 --> 19:14.594
When l come back down, l want you
out of food and out of your pants.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.876
All of them.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.671
Al, how's it coming?

19:28.920 --> 19:33.038
Fine, fine. We're almost ready.
Call back in a few minutes.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.750
No.
That doesn't look like a C either.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.598
Hey, he's been trying for three hours.
There isn't much room left.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.193
We're gonna have to shave
that other cheek.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.550
Come on, Harris. For God's sake,
just make a C. How tough can it be?

19:50.760 --> 19:53.911
-l need a shot.
-l'll give you a shot.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.514
Al, is that you?

20:01.360 --> 20:03.112
Al, I'm in Paris.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.079
Everyone here
is so rude and smelly...

20:06.320 --> 20:09.437
...l'm just thinking
about you all the time.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.956
Oh, Al, l know you
think about me too.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.475
l wish l could see
your face right now.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.876
Oh, stop barking at me.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.908
l know you're upset about the cost
of me taking the Concorde over here...

20:27.160 --> 20:29.151
...but l'm hot on Dad's trail.

20:29.400 --> 20:33.279
Yeah, he was spotted at
a Jerry Lewis film festival.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.317
Bad dog.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.232
That doesn't look like a C.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.118
Lay off, will you?

20:41.360 --> 20:43.999
C is a tough letter.

20:44.880 --> 20:49.158
When your blood has more alcohol
than plasma, they're all tough letters.

20:52.200 --> 20:56.512
Hello. Yeah, Jefferson, come on over.
He's as ready as he's gonna be.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.191
Hold it, partner.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.950
Going somewhere?

21:09.400 --> 21:10.958
Me?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.631
No, ma'am.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.436
Say, l got an idea.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.279
To enhance the pleasure...

21:20.520 --> 21:25.389
...why don't you go up
and hide somewhere real sexy...

21:26.040 --> 21:31.717
...and l'll count while you hide,
and when l find you, oh, baby....

21:37.760 --> 21:39.671
One.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.034
So then what happened?

21:48.440 --> 21:51.512
Well, l made it over
to your dad's house.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.199
Harris repaired the tattoo...

21:53.400 --> 21:57.279
...and Marcie finally got her
anniversary present.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.998
Well, so if the tattoo was fixed,
then why do you need surgery now?

22:03.720 --> 22:05.438
Take a look.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.556
Old-guy butt.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.388
'' l love Marty''?

22:31.840 --> 22:34.308
So l guess you're here
to have that thing removed, huh?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.714
Well, yeah, that...

22:35.920 --> 22:39.549
...and the other thing.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.956
What other thing?

22:44.305 --> 22:50.710
