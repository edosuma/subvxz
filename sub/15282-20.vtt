00:22.000 --> 00:23.467
Taxi!

01:23.200 --> 01:26.000
Spring Street,
Spring Street Station.

01:26.067 --> 01:28.167
Spring Street...

01:30.701 --> 01:32.400
Excuse me.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.067

Hotchner.

02:01.501 --> 02:02.601
Hey.

02:02.667 --> 02:04.601
No, i'm actually
Still at the office.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.400
I'm just getting
Some things-

02:06.467 --> 02:08.434
Oh-whoa. Hold on,
Hold on, hold on.

02:08.501 --> 02:10.934
Start from the beginning.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.934
No, we're all familiar
With the case.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.267
When was the latest murder?

02:16.334 --> 02:18.033
Has anything in the m. o.
Changed?

02:21.334 --> 02:24.367
So, uh, what's
Your flight number?

02:24.434 --> 02:27.434
No, i'm gonna
Come pick you up.

02:27.501 --> 02:29.434
Yeah, exactly.
I can't have you

02:29.501 --> 02:31.968
Free to pick out a crib
Without me.

02:32.033 --> 02:35.100
Jj, can you get The team
together? We have a case.

02:35.167 --> 02:37.501
Nothing's come across
My desk.

02:37.567 --> 02:39.901
This one came
Directly to me.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.634
Uh, just-don't head
To the airport just yet.

02:45.701 --> 02:48.634
I'll call you as soon as i can.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.634
Bye.

02:57.234 --> 02:59.467
Don't get comfortable. There'll
be time to debrief On the plane.

02:59.534 --> 03:00.968
Reid: where are we headed?

03:01.033 --> 03:02.400
New york.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.934
5 shootings in 2 weeks. It's
about time We got the call.

03:04.033 --> 03:05.601
I want to take garcia
With us.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.634
Hopefully they'll give us Access
to their Surveillance systems.

03:07.701 --> 03:08.734
What do we know?

03:08.801 --> 03:10.267
All the killings
Are mid-day.

03:10.334 --> 03:11.901
Single gunshot to the head
With a.22.

03:11.968 --> 03:13.434
No.
Any witnesses?

03:13.501 --> 03:15.100
.22-caliber pistol's
Only 152 decibels.

03:15.167 --> 03:17.701
New york streets and subways
Are routinely well over 100.

03:17.767 --> 03:19.534
It could be people aren't
Even registering the gunshot

03:19.601 --> 03:21.534
Until the unsub's
Already leaving the scene.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.701
They sound like
Mob hits.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.067
Except none of them have ties
To organized crime.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.200
Do they have any
Connection to each other?

03:26.267 --> 03:27.300
None they've found.

03:27.367 --> 03:28.834
How about communication
With the police?

03:28.901 --> 03:30.234
Has the unsub
Tried to make contact?

03:30.300 --> 03:32.834
Surveillance cameras Have
captured video Of 3 of the murders.

03:32.901 --> 03:34.334
This is the latest.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.467
That's the best
Image they have?

03:36.534 --> 03:37.501
They're all the same.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.067
He wears a hood
And keeps his head down.

03:39.133 --> 03:42.400
This guy's bold. Crowded
areas, Broad daylight.

03:42.467 --> 03:43.567
So they're
Completely random?

03:43.634 --> 03:45.000
It seems that way.

03:45.067 --> 03:48.167
Son of sam all over again.

04:26.501 --> 04:27.601
Voltaire said,

04:27.667 --> 04:29.467
"the man visited
By ecstasies and visions

04:29.534 --> 04:32.467
"who takes dreams for realities
Is an enthusiast.

04:32.534 --> 04:35.834
The man who supports His madness
with murder Is a fanatic. "

04:35.901 --> 04:37.601
How come i only get to
Travel with you guys

04:37.667 --> 04:39.400
Like once every 2 years?

04:39.467 --> 04:41.367
Trust me, mama,
It can get old.

04:41.434 --> 04:44.133
Oh, right, like the way that
Spa treatments in 5-star hotels

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200
Can get old.

04:45.267 --> 04:46.634
Remember the time
We got on board

04:46.701 --> 04:47.968
And they hadn't chilled
The cristal?

04:48.033 --> 04:49.567
Ooh. I almost quit
The b. a.u. That day.

04:49.634 --> 04:51.334
Ok, you know what? You
guys can joke All you want,

04:51.400 --> 04:54.334
'Cause i am never
Leaving this plane.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.000
The victims?

04:58.067 --> 05:00.234
Each killed in a completely
Different neighborhood.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.234
Hell's kitchen, murray hill,
Lower east side,

05:02.300 --> 05:03.567
Chinatown, east harlem.

05:03.634 --> 05:04.901
It doesn't make
Any sense.

05:04.968 --> 05:07.434
There's no common Victimology,
No sexual component,

05:07.501 --> 05:09.267
No robbery,
No geographical connection.

05:09.334 --> 05:10.701
Do the police
Have any leads?

05:10.767 --> 05:12.234
He's killing roughly
Every 2 days.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.767
The press is having
A field day,

05:13.834 --> 05:15.701
And it sounds like The mood on
the street's Getting pretty edgy.

05:15.767 --> 05:18.701
It's a joint FBI-NYPD
Taskforce?

05:18.767 --> 05:20.801
Kate Joyner heads up
The new york field office.

05:20.868 --> 05:23.467
She's running point on the case
And called me directly.

05:23.534 --> 05:25.000
Jj, would you tell them
We're ready to go?

05:25.067 --> 05:26.300
Right.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.968
Kate's starting to butt heads
With the lead detectives

05:29.033 --> 05:30.033
And wanted
A fresh set of eyes.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.033
Joyner, i know her.
She's a brit, right?

05:32.100 --> 05:34.601
Well, dual citizenship. Her father's
british, Her mother's american.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.601
She was a big deal At scotland
yard Before coming to the bureau.

05:37.667 --> 05:41.434
I heard she can be A little
bit of a pain In the ass.

05:41.501 --> 05:42.501
I didn't think so.

05:42.567 --> 05:43.767
You know her?

05:43.834 --> 05:45.367
We liaised when she was
Still at scotland yard.

05:45.434 --> 05:46.367
And she's good?

05:46.434 --> 05:47.701
I think we're lucky
To have her.

05:47.767 --> 05:50.400
Pilot: and we're cleared
For takeoff.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.000
Please take your seats.

05:58.968 --> 06:01.167
Can you have someone
Run to my flat,

06:01.234 --> 06:02.667
Get me an extra set
Of clothes?

06:02.734 --> 06:04.834
And tell forensics
I don't want to just

06:04.901 --> 06:06.334
Cross-check with
Connecticut And new jersey.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.834
I want interpol as well.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.334
Has the b. a.u.
Arrived yet?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.200
They should be here soon.

06:11.267 --> 06:14.200
Shelly, can you get me
The commissioner?

06:19.033 --> 06:21.868
Never mind. Hold the call.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.300
Is it just me

06:28.367 --> 06:30.667
Or does she look
Exactly like haley?

06:32.067 --> 06:33.300
Kate.

06:33.367 --> 06:35.634
Aaron.
How have you been?

06:35.701 --> 06:37.601
Well, thank you.
This is my team.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.467
Kate joyner,
This is david rossi,

06:39.534 --> 06:41.200
Emily prentiss,
Jennifer jareau,

06:41.267 --> 06:43.667
Penelope garcia, derek morgan,
And spencer reid.

06:43.734 --> 06:46.868
Thanks for being here. Anything
that you need, Just tell me.

06:46.934 --> 06:48.868
Please don't stand
On protocol.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.968
What can you tell us About
the city's Surveillance system?

06:51.033 --> 06:52.200
Um, it's run by
The nypd.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.200
It's still
In the infant stages.

06:54.267 --> 06:55.868
It's been rather
Controversial.

06:55.934 --> 06:57.367
American privacy laws.

06:57.434 --> 06:59.300
Um, but they've had
Some success.

06:59.367 --> 07:01.234
And i'll have complete access?

07:01.300 --> 07:02.701
They're already
Expecting you.

07:02.767 --> 07:03.834
Shelly?

07:03.901 --> 07:05.334
I'd like to get
A map of the borough.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.100
I want to do a comprehensive
Geographical profile of the area

07:08.167 --> 07:09.367
In order to ascertain
The unsub's mental map

07:09.434 --> 07:11.100
Before it's clouded by
Our own linkage blindness.

07:11.167 --> 07:13.767
I see you brought
Your own computer.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.767
Detectives brustin
And cooper.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.300
I'll let you do
The introductions.

07:18.367 --> 07:19.667
You caught
The first shooting?

07:19.734 --> 07:21.334
They've all been
In different precincts.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.501
It wasn't until
The third murder

07:22.567 --> 07:24.701
That anyone even made
The connection.

07:24.767 --> 07:27.000
I guess this is where We play
nice and ask you What you need.

07:27.067 --> 07:29.467
I'll let you all
Figure out what that is.

07:29.534 --> 07:32.567
I just ask that you run
Everything back through me.

07:32.634 --> 07:33.934
It's been my experience

07:34.000 --> 07:36.133
That having one butt
On the line is enough.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.968
Yes, ma'am.

07:39.267 --> 07:40.300
Can i have a word
With you in private?

07:40.367 --> 07:42.067
Sure.

07:42.133 --> 07:43.167
Excuse me.

07:45.234 --> 07:46.400
They, um...

07:46.467 --> 07:49.868
Liaised when she was
At scotland yard.

07:49.934 --> 07:50.901
Of course.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.901
So you're getting resistance
From nypd?

07:59.968 --> 08:01.100
It's nothing
I wasn't expecting.

08:01.167 --> 08:03.167
They're good detectives,

08:03.234 --> 08:05.868
Just no self-respecting cop
Wants to have his ass kicked

08:05.934 --> 08:07.968
By some broad with a posh
British accent.

08:08.033 --> 08:10.434
So what's going on?

08:10.501 --> 08:13.767
What can you tell me
About derek morgan?

08:19.367 --> 08:23.734
Hey, so, uh, what's
Your partner's problem?

08:23.801 --> 08:26.300
Uh, well...

08:26.367 --> 08:29.501
Well, by the fourth murder
The fbi was brought in.

08:29.567 --> 08:32.601
Good. We can use
All the help we can get.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.833
But, uh, all of a sudden She's
taking meetings With the mayor

08:34.900 --> 08:37.333
And calling in you all Without
us knowing Anything about it.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.200
We're only here to help.
Think of us as a resource.

08:40.267 --> 08:41.701
Ok.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.100
Profile me.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.067
What am i thinking?

08:47.701 --> 08:49.467
It's never gonna happen.

08:51.868 --> 08:54.367
No offense,
But we've had 5 murders.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.868
Hope it gets better
Than that.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.501
You must be fbi.
Lisa bartleby.

09:30.567 --> 09:32.601
Penelope garcia.
May i?

09:35.901 --> 09:39.701
I hardly ever
Get visitors.

09:39.767 --> 09:43.200
You'll hardly know i'm here.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.133
What's your operating system?

09:45.200 --> 09:48.534
Um, linux os
With 6 gigs of ram.

09:48.601 --> 09:51.234
And a dual quad core
3- gigahertz processor

09:51.300 --> 09:53.167
With a geforce 8800
Ultra extreme vid card

09:53.234 --> 09:56.701
And a cisco asa 5500 firewall.

09:56.767 --> 09:57.701
Yeah.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.234
Bitchin'. How many cameras?

09:59.300 --> 10:00.834
Uh, 4,468,

10:00.901 --> 10:03.801
Not including the ones That
only run In the housing projects.

10:03.868 --> 10:05.200
And all the footage
Is stored?

10:05.267 --> 10:06.667
Catalogued and digitized.

10:06.734 --> 10:09.300
Beautiful. 'Cause my boss man
Wants me to send him a file

10:09.367 --> 10:10.868
So he can run facial
Recognition software

10:10.934 --> 10:12.868
On each of the crime scenes.

10:12.934 --> 10:15.534
Um, i've already enhanced All
of the photos As much as i can.

10:15.601 --> 10:19.467
No, i'm talking about using it On the
crowd immediately After the shootings.

10:19.534 --> 10:22.067
This is icky, but these creeps,
They sometimes like to come back

10:22.133 --> 10:23.901
And watch the police
Deal with their handiwork.

10:23.968 --> 10:25.567
And... voila.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.734
14th street...

11:27.367 --> 11:29.067
Can i ask you a question? When
was the last time You went home

11:29.133 --> 11:30.234
And got some sleep?

11:30.300 --> 11:32.434
None of us are going to
Sleep until this is over.

11:49.801 --> 11:51.901
Who in the hell thinks they
Can get away with murder

11:51.968 --> 11:53.901
In the middle of the day
In new york city?

11:53.968 --> 11:55.234
Someone patient

11:55.300 --> 11:56.400
Who waits for the one

11:56.467 --> 11:59.467
Who gets separated
From the flock.

11:59.534 --> 12:01.267
Bang.

12:01.334 --> 12:02.434
Is that the spot?

12:03.767 --> 12:05.133
Yeah. Thereabouts.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.000
Are we boring you?

12:14.367 --> 12:17.334
Look, i know you don't
Like ssa joyner.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.000
Fine. I get it.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.667
But we're here
To do a job.

12:20.734 --> 12:23.767
Have any of your people
Ever been cops?

12:23.834 --> 12:25.067
Chicago.

12:25.133 --> 12:26.467
Then you'll understand.

12:26.534 --> 12:28.734
I take it real personal
If something like this

12:28.801 --> 12:31.234
Happens in my city. I was a
beat cop During the son of sam.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.467
This is worse.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.033
He's not just going after
One type.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.734
He's going after everybody.

12:36.801 --> 12:39.067
And i need everybody
Working on this case,

12:39.133 --> 12:40.801
Taking it personally.

12:40.868 --> 12:42.133
You have that.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.934
We'll see.

12:50.868 --> 12:53.400
How long have you
Been doing this?

12:53.467 --> 12:55.367
Uh, about 6 months.

12:55.434 --> 12:58.334
I wish i could tell you
It gets easier.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.667
Yeah, well, i'm used to
Pulling footage up

13:00.734 --> 13:03.000
For muggings,
Maybe robberies.

13:03.067 --> 13:06.000
Watching someone
Get shot in the head...

13:06.067 --> 13:08.534
You know what helps me?

13:08.601 --> 13:11.868
You make it your own.
You know? You...

13:11.934 --> 13:14.434
Separate yourself
From what you see on the screen.

13:16.234 --> 13:18.033
This isn't exactly,
Uh...

13:18.100 --> 13:20.033
Regulation.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.601
Well, then thank god
It's only us in here.

13:25.501 --> 13:27.367
Do you want to see a superfox?

13:28.901 --> 13:31.067
What camera's on
The last crime scene?

13:33.934 --> 13:35.868
Derek morgan...

13:35.934 --> 13:36.868
Lisa bartleby.

13:36.934 --> 13:38.234
Lisa bartleby,

13:38.300 --> 13:40.033
Derek morgan.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.400
This guy's definitely Not afraid
to get up close And personal.

13:42.467 --> 13:43.734
Or be visible.

13:43.801 --> 13:44.934
If you watch the tape,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.067
He ducks his head the second
He steps off the train.

13:47.133 --> 13:48.334
So he knows when
He's being filmed.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.434
Well, we've had
Glimpses, but the...

13:51.501 --> 13:52.901
Descriptions
Have been sketchy.

13:52.968 --> 13:54.400
Some people said
He's a light-skinned black man,

13:54.467 --> 13:58.100
Asian, puerto rican, Basically
every homeboy In the city.

13:58.167 --> 13:59.434
Ballistics were the same
For every shooting?

13:59.501 --> 14:01.334
We checked the records
Back 10 years.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.767
The gun's never been
Recycled.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.901
.22s aren't exactly
The weapon of choice these days.

14:04.968 --> 14:06.501
Unless you're israeli
Intelligence.

14:06.567 --> 14:10.501
That's what the mossad Uses for
all their Political assassinations.

14:10.567 --> 14:12.300
All i know
Is this guy's organized.

14:12.367 --> 14:13.634
He studies the cameras,

14:13.701 --> 14:16.200
Carries a gun
That's easy to conceal.

14:16.267 --> 14:18.067
He knows what he's doing.

14:35.634 --> 14:38.167
We're gonna need records
Over the last 6 months

14:38.234 --> 14:40.300
For any arrests on gun
Violence or gun possession

14:40.367 --> 14:43.701
In every borough except The ones
where the shootings Have taken place.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.467
Uh... i don't get it.

14:45.534 --> 14:48.200
He won't strike
Near where he lives.

14:48.267 --> 14:49.567
What makes you so sure?

14:49.634 --> 14:51.868
It's anti-geographical
Profiling.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.033
Now it's anti-geographical
Profiling?

14:54.100 --> 14:55.501
Yeah, come on.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.801
You wonder why
We're so skeptical?

14:57.868 --> 14:59.000
This unsub's organized.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.501
He strikes
At the same time of day.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.000
He knows where
The cameras are placed.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.534
That means he's doing
His own pre-surveillance.

15:03.601 --> 15:05.000
A need-motivated killer

15:05.067 --> 15:06.868
Operates within his own
Comfort zone.

15:06.934 --> 15:08.834
An organized killer
With some other motivation

15:08.901 --> 15:11.367
Will make sure to strike
Outside that zone.

15:11.434 --> 15:13.267
Exactly.
Not where he lives.

15:13.334 --> 15:15.868
Unfortunately, that means That
every other Neighborhood in the city

15:15.934 --> 15:17.968
Has a reason
To be terrified.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.133
Excuse me.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.868
Pretzel, no mustard.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.801
Uniforms are rounding up
Witnesses.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.901
It doesn't seem like anyone
Got a clean look.

15:53.968 --> 15:55.534
It's over in a flash.

15:55.601 --> 15:58.000
He's probably gone before Anyone
even realizes What's happening.

15:58.067 --> 16:00.734
Is this what it felt like
During the son of sam?

16:00.801 --> 16:02.934
First we realized That if
the violence Was truly random,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.801
There was almost no way
Of stopping it.

16:04.868 --> 16:07.234
It seems like these people
Have figured that out.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.667
From the placement
Of that camera,

16:08.734 --> 16:09.934
Odds are the only view
They're gonna get

16:10.000 --> 16:11.100
Is the back of his head.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.601
Let's not be too quick
To decide

16:12.667 --> 16:14.100
What we do or don't have.

16:18.334 --> 16:21.367
Whoo! The duchess
Of work has spoken.

16:22.767 --> 16:25.234
You mind telling me why
I'm catching attitude from her?

16:26.701 --> 16:28.467
Fbi brass
Has made it clear to her

16:28.534 --> 16:31.868
That if she doesn't Bring this case
home, She's gonna be reassigned.

16:31.934 --> 16:34.167
And you are at the top
Of the list to replace her.

16:35.267 --> 16:36.300
You're kidding me.

16:36.367 --> 16:37.701
Why should you be surprised?

16:37.767 --> 16:40.834
You're good at your job.
People notice that.

16:40.901 --> 16:43.300
What happened to the bureau
Patting itself on the back

16:43.367 --> 16:44.901
For stealing her away
From scotland yard?

16:44.968 --> 16:46.467
I don't know.

16:46.534 --> 16:48.133
Politics here
Are different.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.300
And you can see she
Doesn't pull punches.

16:55.234 --> 16:58.734
6 murders and he's finally
Communicating with us.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.167
Cooper: what's that?

17:00.234 --> 17:01.901
That's a tarot card.

17:01.968 --> 17:03.067
Death.

17:03.133 --> 17:04.233
Isn't that a little
On the nose,

17:04.300 --> 17:05.867
Even for a psycho?

17:05.934 --> 17:08.800
So we think this guy's
Into spiritual garbage?

17:08.867 --> 17:10.666
If he is, he certainly
Doesn't know tarot.

17:10.733 --> 17:13.400
The death card doesn't
Actually signify Physical death.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.901
It's more of a transformation
From one place to another-

17:15.968 --> 17:17.133
A job promotion
Or a marriage.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.000
So if he's not telling us

17:19.067 --> 17:20.800
He's into fortune-telling,
What's with the card?

17:20.867 --> 17:23.901
The d. c. Sniper left The exact
same card At one of his scenes.

17:23.968 --> 17:25.400
So this unsub

17:25.467 --> 17:26.901
Must see himself
In that role.

17:26.968 --> 17:29.033
He's thriving
Off creating a panic.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.601
More important,
He studies other cases.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.868
He's telling us...
He knows we're here.

18:11.634 --> 18:13.267
What have we got?

18:13.334 --> 18:14.734
The latest shooting.

18:20.501 --> 18:22.100
This was the previous
Murder.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.734
Ok, do you see
Anything weird here?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.434
He sprints off in one
And walks calmly in the other.

18:28.501 --> 18:29.968
It's two entirely
Different demeanors.

18:30.033 --> 18:31.601
6 kills in, his behavior
Should be set.

18:31.667 --> 18:32.734
Look at this.

18:32.801 --> 18:34.400
Garcia,
Are you still there?

18:34.467 --> 18:36.901
Would i ever leave you?
Ok, check it out.

18:36.968 --> 18:38.634
I did a digital perspective
Analysis rendering

18:38.701 --> 18:40.534
On the shootings
Where we have footage.

18:40.601 --> 18:41.734
Now, the first two
Are inconclusive,

18:41.801 --> 18:44.701
But the last two
I found something tres weird.

18:44.767 --> 18:46.868
Your calm walking type,

18:46.934 --> 18:50.200
He is about 6'1".

18:50.267 --> 18:51.234
But your sprinter,

18:51.300 --> 18:54.767
He's like 5'9", 5'10", tops.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.634
We've got more
Than one unsub.

19:08.133 --> 19:10.267
So, we have
More than one unsub.

19:10.334 --> 19:11.667
What does that tell us?

19:11.734 --> 19:13.100
Most teams stick together.

19:13.167 --> 19:14.534
Uh, ng and lake,
The krays.

19:14.601 --> 19:15.534
Bittaker and norris.

19:15.601 --> 19:16.701
They don't usually
Kill separately.

19:16.767 --> 19:19.300
Could be some kind
Of gang initiation.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.467
Gangs will kill you If they
encroach On your territory,

19:21.534 --> 19:24.234
Not random people
All over the city.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.367
I'll coordinate
With the gang taskforce,

19:25.434 --> 19:26.801
Make sure we have
An overview by morning.

19:26.868 --> 19:29.234
Do you think We have enough
For a working profile?

19:29.300 --> 19:30.601
Broad strokes.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.834
Dave, you and reid
Talk to the agents here.

19:32.901 --> 19:34.868
Morgan and prentiss,
Brief the police

19:34.934 --> 19:36.400
When each shift
Comes on duty tomorrow.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.000
I think we should
Get out on the streets.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.100
I brought you here
To create a profile.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.367
Which we can give
In the morning,

19:41.434 --> 19:43.234
And then they can share it
With the afternoon shift.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.834
We've allocated every
Extra man we have.

19:45.901 --> 19:48.033
This is new york city. It's
not like a few More people

19:48.100 --> 19:50.033
Is going to blanket
The city.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.868
I understand it's a long shot,

19:51.934 --> 19:53.934
But these guys,
They hit at mid-day.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.767
We could target ingress And
egress to particular Neighborhoods.

19:56.834 --> 19:58.534
Position us near
Express stops-

19:58.601 --> 20:00.267
14th, 42nd, 59th-

20:00.334 --> 20:01.767
Morgan,
It's not your call.

20:05.267 --> 20:06.567
I'd like to join you
In the profile

20:06.634 --> 20:08.901
If that's not
Stepping on your toes.

20:08.968 --> 20:10.067
No problem.

20:13.567 --> 20:14.601
Let's see it again.

20:20.234 --> 20:21.968
Look at this.

20:22.033 --> 20:24.000
Late edition doesn't
Miss a beat.

20:26.868 --> 20:28.767
Jj.

20:32.334 --> 20:34.701
Will.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.033
Took a shot and flew to d. c.,

20:37.100 --> 20:38.434
But that didn't work out.

20:38.501 --> 20:40.534
I figured a train ride To new
york was only A few more hours.

20:40.601 --> 20:41.767
Detective.

20:41.834 --> 20:43.100
I'm sorry for
Showing up like this.

20:43.167 --> 20:44.200
I know you're working.

20:44.267 --> 20:46.934
But, um...

20:47.000 --> 20:49.701
i can't stand you
Being on this case

20:49.767 --> 20:53.534
And me not being there.
Not with what's going on.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.234
Is there a problem?

21:04.534 --> 21:06.334
I'm pregnant.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.701
Oh, my god! Jj!

21:10.767 --> 21:12.400
Congratulations!

21:12.467 --> 21:13.667
I've asked jj to marry me.

21:13.734 --> 21:15.033
Will.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.734
We're working out
Some kinks.

21:16.801 --> 21:19.901
We'll, uh, give you
Both some privacy.

21:21.968 --> 21:23.801
Hotch.

21:23.868 --> 21:26.367
Jj, you could have
Told me.

21:26.434 --> 21:27.868
I know.

21:27.934 --> 21:29.400
I understand if you
Need to take some time.

21:29.467 --> 21:33.000
No, i-i want to be here.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.934
Ok.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.767
7 a. m.

21:43.901 --> 21:46.000
Are you crazy?

21:46.067 --> 21:49.901
I told you i couldn't
Get any personal time.

21:49.968 --> 21:51.701
Come back to d. c.
With me tomorrow.

21:51.767 --> 21:53.434
Oh, you're not serious.

21:53.501 --> 21:55.868
They know now.

21:55.934 --> 21:57.267
They'd understand.

21:57.334 --> 22:00.467
Will, w-we're covering
A case with 6 murders.

22:00.534 --> 22:02.467
Exactly.

22:02.534 --> 22:03.901
Your job is too dangerous now.

22:03.968 --> 22:05.400
Yeah, exactly like yours.

22:05.467 --> 22:07.801
What, are you gonna
Give up your shield?

22:09.801 --> 22:12.100
Look, i love the gesture,

22:12.167 --> 22:13.634
And i love the romance,

22:13.701 --> 22:15.067
But...

22:15.133 --> 22:17.534
We're both gonna be
Parents, will.

22:17.601 --> 22:19.434
Neither one of us has,

22:19.501 --> 22:21.467
You know, exactly
A typical job.

22:21.534 --> 22:24.367
The first thing a cop does
When she gets pregnant

22:24.434 --> 22:26.200
Is she takes herself
Out of the field.

22:26.267 --> 22:28.234
Ok, you know what?

22:28.300 --> 22:30.234
We only have until 7:00.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.901
So can we just argue
About names and cribs?

22:32.968 --> 22:35.901
Only if you let me win.

22:37.467 --> 22:39.801
Not a chance.

22:42.133 --> 22:43.801
Ok, let's start
With what we know.

22:43.868 --> 22:46.934
With these unsubs,
It's not personal.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.601
It's not about sex,
It's not about greed.

22:49.667 --> 22:52.033
Which is why we think There's
something bigger At play here.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.267
This isn't random.

22:53.334 --> 22:55.033
There has to be a motive.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.501
Now, our first theory Is that
we're dealing With a team.

22:57.567 --> 22:59.300
In the case
Of the d. c. Snipers,

22:59.367 --> 23:01.601
There was actually
One intended victim.

23:01.667 --> 23:03.801
John muhammad wanted
To kill his ex-wife,

23:03.868 --> 23:06.234
But he knew if he did,
He'd be the prime suspect,

23:06.300 --> 23:08.834
So he created a spree In order
to mask His primary motivation.

23:08.901 --> 23:11.567
Muhammad and malvo Also left a
death card At one of their scenes,

23:11.634 --> 23:12.868
Just like this unsub.

23:12.934 --> 23:15.000
We believe our unsubs
Have studied that case.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.701
They're opening
A line of communication.

23:16.767 --> 23:19.067
Hold on. So now We got
these guys Playing games

23:19.133 --> 23:20.601
Just 'cause you're here?

23:20.667 --> 23:24.000
We're just saying the unsubs
Are sophisticated enough

23:24.067 --> 23:25.200
To study other crimes.

23:25.267 --> 23:26.868
That doesn't answer
The question.

23:26.934 --> 23:28.734
Joe. Easy.
Hear 'em out.

23:28.801 --> 23:30.834
Hey, i got requests
For gun permits up 200%

23:30.901 --> 23:33.868
In my precinct. This whole
city's About to go off,

23:33.934 --> 23:36.300
And we all need
To deal with that.

23:36.367 --> 23:37.400
Hey, listen. You're right.

23:37.467 --> 23:39.033
If the card was left
Because of us, then yes,

23:39.100 --> 23:40.367
They are playing games.

23:40.434 --> 23:42.667
But what that tells us
Is at least one of them

23:42.734 --> 23:43.934
Has some intelligence.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.267
And like i said,
They know about other cases.

23:46.334 --> 23:48.167
He's also studied the placement

23:48.234 --> 23:51.200
Of the surveillance systems
Well enough to avoid detection.

23:51.267 --> 23:53.868
Most teams have a dominant
And submissive member.

23:53.934 --> 23:55.901
Because of the relative
Intelligence of these unsubs

23:55.968 --> 23:58.300
And the fact they stick
To a set time pattern,

23:58.367 --> 24:00.367
We believe at least one
Of them has a steady job.

24:00.434 --> 24:03.167
We've asked the police
To canvass their precincts,

24:03.234 --> 24:06.968
Check businesses that open And close
around the time Of the shootings.

24:07.033 --> 24:08.667
We're hoping someone
Will be able to identify

24:08.734 --> 24:11.133
A father-son or coworkers

24:11.200 --> 24:13.534
That fit the
Dominant-submissive profile.

24:13.601 --> 24:15.601
And what's
The other theory?

24:15.667 --> 24:19.067
It's less likely, But it could
be some sort Of gang initiation.

24:19.133 --> 24:22.701
We've asked the police To put every
available Undercover on the streets.

24:22.767 --> 24:24.934
These are all known
Gang members in manhattan.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.400
Most of them are out of
Chinatown and clinton.

24:26.467 --> 24:27.734
We'd like you to study these

24:27.801 --> 24:30.234
And keep an eye out For
anyone Who looks suspicious.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.400
Joyner: i'll also be detailing
A number of you as well.

24:32.467 --> 24:35.868
Stay behind when the agents Have finished
and i'll Give you your assignments.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.634
Like they said, We think there's
something Bigger at play here.

24:38.701 --> 24:40.367
So talk to the people
On your beats,

24:40.434 --> 24:42.133
See if something sparks,

24:42.200 --> 24:44.968
And pray this thing
Ain't random.

25:03.901 --> 25:05.767
How many undercovers
Do we have?

25:05.834 --> 25:08.200
Over 80, but it
Barely makes a blip.

25:08.267 --> 25:10.200
Surveillance cameras Aren't
designed To prevent crime,

25:10.267 --> 25:13.734
They're supposed to Help us
catch the perp After the fact.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.133
I got one.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.300
Is there anyone nearby?

25:18.367 --> 25:20.634
Negative.

25:20.701 --> 25:22.467
This is the surveillance
Command center.

25:22.534 --> 25:24.267
We have a possible
Murder suspect

25:24.334 --> 25:26.400
At the subway platform
On 59th and lex.

25:26.467 --> 25:27.901
Ok.

25:28.968 --> 25:30.000
Hotchner.

25:30.067 --> 25:32.601
Does it look like he could
Be one of our guys?

25:32.667 --> 25:34.801
What's going on? We've
got eyes On one of them.

25:34.868 --> 25:36.734
He's on the subway
Platform at 59th and lex.

25:36.801 --> 25:39.400
59th? We could have
Been right there.

25:39.467 --> 25:41.601
He's got a gun.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.267
Oh, my god.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.601
He shot her.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.234
Where the hell
Are the police?

25:46.300 --> 25:48.267
This is kate joyner
With the fbi.

25:48.334 --> 25:50.968
We have a murder suspect,
Subway platform, 59th and lex.

25:51.033 --> 25:52.267
He's getting away.

25:52.334 --> 25:54.434
Garcia, can you get eyes
On him aboveground?

25:55.501 --> 25:57.968
He's heading west
On 59th street.

25:58.033 --> 25:59.801
If he makes it to the park,
We've lost him.

26:01.334 --> 26:02.634
We've lost the visual.

26:02.701 --> 26:05.200
Are the police
On the scene?

26:05.267 --> 26:06.868
Negative.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.801
We could've had that guy.

26:11.868 --> 26:13.400
Even if we were
On that platform,

26:13.467 --> 26:15.067
Odds are he would have Moved
on to somewhere More isolated.

26:15.133 --> 26:17.834
Maybe, but it was worth
Taking a shot.

26:17.901 --> 26:19.868
We had every available man
On the street.

26:19.934 --> 26:22.334
And i suggested to you
That you use this team.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.968
Second-guessing doesn't
Do us any good right now.

26:24.033 --> 26:25.501
Hotch, how am i supposed
To look these cops in the eye

26:25.567 --> 26:27.033
And tell them that we're
Actually here to help them?

26:27.100 --> 26:28.400
We're here
To present a profile.

26:28.467 --> 26:29.400
That's what we need to do.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.334
I said to put us
At express stops-

26:31.400 --> 26:34.400
14th, 42nd, 59th
- And that's exactly Where they hit.

26:34.467 --> 26:35.934
It's not your place
To have this discussion.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.200
You need to back off.
My place?

26:38.267 --> 26:39.901
We got 7 bodies, man.

26:39.968 --> 26:42.400
Which is exactly why
We need to stay focused.

26:42.467 --> 26:43.667
Focused.

26:45.234 --> 26:46.334
From where i'm standing,

26:46.400 --> 26:48.400
All your focus is on her.

26:50.167 --> 26:52.167
Take a walk, now.

27:10.133 --> 27:11.601
I know.

27:13.934 --> 27:16.200
I was out of line.

27:16.267 --> 27:18.033
You get too emotionally
Involved sometimes.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.200
I know the feeling.

27:19.267 --> 27:21.901
I just felt like hotch
Was taking her side.

27:21.968 --> 27:23.033
There are no sides here.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.501
I know.

27:26.567 --> 27:29.200
The word is, they have
An eye on you

27:29.267 --> 27:31.234
If ssa joyner gets canned.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.834
People talk.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.400
But if
She were to get fired,

27:34.467 --> 27:36.334
It would be because
We didn't solve this case.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.567
Rossi,
I hope you're not saying

27:38.634 --> 27:39.868
You think i want her to fail.

27:39.934 --> 27:41.334
Of course not.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.033
But i've never seen you Push
a superior Like that before.

27:46.801 --> 27:48.767
So would you take the job?

27:51.634 --> 27:54.100
I don't know.

27:54.167 --> 27:57.067
It might be nice To finally
be the one Making the calls.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.033
And dealing With the politics
of Running a field office?

27:59.100 --> 28:01.033
That doesn't seem like you.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.634
B.a. u. Wears people out, man.

28:07.701 --> 28:09.167
Look at gideon.

28:09.234 --> 28:11.667
That man was the best,
And in the end,

28:11.734 --> 28:13.067
He simply ran away.

28:14.501 --> 28:16.501
I mean, hotch hasn't even
Thought about cracking a smile

28:16.567 --> 28:17.667
In over a year.

28:17.734 --> 28:19.167
That man has to take
A personal day

28:19.234 --> 28:22.968
Just so he can have A
conversation With his own kid.

28:23.033 --> 28:24.434
What about you?

28:26.133 --> 28:27.934
How many times
You been married?

28:29.901 --> 28:31.734
I get it.

28:31.801 --> 28:33.501
But i'll make you
A deal.

28:33.567 --> 28:36.100
If i think you're losing it,
I'll pull you out myself.

28:36.167 --> 28:41.701
But right now, I see someone
who wants To get back on the job.

28:41.767 --> 28:46.501
Or is there another reason Why
you haven't even Touched that beer?

29:10.901 --> 29:13.200
Listen, um...

29:13.267 --> 29:14.200
About before...

29:14.267 --> 29:16.801
You spoke your mind.
I respect that.

29:16.868 --> 29:21.133
Jj, reid, and prentiss Went to the
crime scene With the detectives.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.367
This is the first time They've killed
2 days in a row. They're speeding up.

29:23.434 --> 29:26.167
Your analyst went over
The latest footage.

29:26.234 --> 29:28.701
This is a different shooter
From the last two.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.400
There's 3 of them now?

29:31.634 --> 29:33.534
Who the hell are these guys?

29:33.601 --> 29:37.133
I want you all out
On the street tomorrow.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.234
What are we missing?

29:39.300 --> 29:40.667
When we first saw this case,
What did it remind us of?

29:40.734 --> 29:42.167
Son of sam.

29:42.234 --> 29:44.501
Same kind of unsub. Random
shootings, Not need-driven,

29:44.567 --> 29:46.434
No sexual component.

29:46.501 --> 29:47.868
Except that berkowitz
Admitted that he would return

29:47.934 --> 29:49.534
To the scenes of his crimes
Days later to masturbate.

29:49.601 --> 29:51.267
Exactly.

29:51.334 --> 29:52.501
So you're thinking
If the dominant unsub

29:52.567 --> 29:53.534
Has a similar m. o...

29:53.601 --> 29:55.534
We get garcia to study
The footage and see

29:55.601 --> 29:57.701
If the same person Keeps
returning To the crime scene

29:57.767 --> 29:59.033
In the days
Following the shootings.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.234
All we've been
Looking at right now

30:00.300 --> 30:02.434
Are the immediate
Aftermaths of the crimes.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.868
It's worth a shot.

30:03.934 --> 30:05.434
We'll hit the street
Tomorrow.

30:05.501 --> 30:06.868
Dave, will you grab reid
And go over the profile

30:06.934 --> 30:09.033
And make sure we didn't
Leave anything out? Thanks.

30:19.133 --> 30:20.567
Ok, people, talk to me.

30:20.634 --> 30:22.701
Mousketeer roll call-
59th street?

30:23.868 --> 30:25.601
Check.

30:25.667 --> 30:26.601
Herald square.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.067
Check.

30:28.133 --> 30:29.067
Chambers street?

30:29.133 --> 30:30.467
Check.

30:30.534 --> 30:31.868
72nd street?

30:31.934 --> 30:32.901
Check.

30:34.467 --> 30:36.901
Detective...

30:36.968 --> 30:38.234
The son of sam-

30:38.300 --> 30:41.667
This case still Pisses you
off Like it was yesterday.

30:41.734 --> 30:42.901
Yeah, it does.

30:42.968 --> 30:44.367
There have been a lot
Of killers in this city.

30:44.434 --> 30:45.567
Why him?

30:45.634 --> 30:47.901
He was laughing at us
And we couldn't catch him.

30:47.968 --> 30:48.901
The only way
We grabbed him

30:48.968 --> 30:50.534
Was through
A parking ticket.

30:50.601 --> 30:52.400
What are you thinking?

30:52.467 --> 30:54.734
He hasn't contacted us again.

30:54.801 --> 30:56.300
So?

30:56.367 --> 30:57.467
This doesn't fit.

30:57.534 --> 30:59.367
These unsubs are organized.

30:59.434 --> 31:00.701
They use pre-surveillance.

31:00.767 --> 31:02.367
They strike in the heart
Of the day

31:02.434 --> 31:04.367
And yet they haven't done
Anything

31:04.434 --> 31:06.367
To seek out media attention.

31:06.434 --> 31:07.834
And then this.

31:07.901 --> 31:11.334
You said it was To tell
you they knew You were here.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.968
We profiled that he was Trying
to open a line Of communication,

31:14.033 --> 31:15.901
Create panic,
But if that was the case,

31:15.968 --> 31:17.834
His correspondence
Should escalate.

31:17.901 --> 31:19.234
After they left
Their death card,

31:19.300 --> 31:21.467
Muhammad and malvo
Demanded an atm card

31:21.534 --> 31:23.734
With a million dollars In a bank
account Just to taunt the police.

31:23.801 --> 31:26.167
Berkowitz wrote rambling
Letters about hunting The city,

31:26.234 --> 31:27.968
Describing himself
As a monster.

31:28.033 --> 31:30.601
These unsubs are more
Disciplined than that.

31:30.667 --> 31:32.834
The fact that they haven't
Contacted the press

31:32.901 --> 31:36.567
Tells me...
That this was private.

31:36.634 --> 31:38.200
It's only for us.

31:38.267 --> 31:40.634
So what does that mean?

31:40.701 --> 31:42.234
They're ramping up
To something,

31:42.300 --> 31:46.067
And they want us to know
That they're watching us.

31:46.133 --> 31:48.701
If you saw All of these traits
Completely out of context,

31:48.767 --> 31:52.601
What would be The first
profile To pop into your head?

31:52.667 --> 31:55.901
Who do we have
Out on the streets?

31:58.501 --> 32:00.200
Talk.

32:00.267 --> 32:01.267
Garcia, do you have eyes
On everyone on the team?

32:01.334 --> 32:02.934
I can get them.

32:05.033 --> 32:06.534
So, uh...

32:06.601 --> 32:08.868
If we're undercover,
Maybe we should, uh,

32:08.934 --> 32:10.767
You know,
Act like a couple.

32:10.834 --> 32:12.934
Are you still working

32:13.000 --> 32:15.467
This tired
Sexual tension angle?

32:15.534 --> 32:17.834
I don't know. You're the
fortune-teller. You tell me.

32:17.901 --> 32:20.200
You want to know
What profiling is, really?

32:20.267 --> 32:22.767
Why do i have a feeling I'm
gonna hear No matter what i say?

32:22.834 --> 32:24.434
It's just noticing
Behavior.

32:24.501 --> 32:26.434
I'm about to hear
About mine.

32:26.501 --> 32:27.767
Is that the deal?

32:27.834 --> 32:29.801
Ok. When we first met,

32:29.868 --> 32:32.801
When your partner was sarcastic
And said, "yes, ma'am,"

32:32.868 --> 32:35.167
You instinctively reached
For your detective shield,

32:35.234 --> 32:37.634
As if you were
Protecting it.

32:37.701 --> 32:40.133
That tells me you don't Like him
disrespecting The chain of command.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.067
But you're also loyal, So you
didn't say Something to him.

32:43.133 --> 32:44.601
I'd say you were military,

32:44.667 --> 32:46.400
Probably an officer.

32:46.467 --> 32:50.167
Praise in public,
Censure in private, right?

32:50.234 --> 32:52.834
You're right-handed, But you
have two Different color pen marks

32:52.901 --> 32:54.000
On your left hand.

32:54.067 --> 32:55.434
I'd guess you have
A toddler at home

32:55.501 --> 32:57.167
Just learning how to draw.

32:57.234 --> 32:58.701
You don't wear a ring.

32:58.767 --> 33:00.834
And you were quick
To flirt with me.

33:00.901 --> 33:03.901
So you're happy To let
people think You are a player.

33:03.968 --> 33:07.133
But if i took you up on it,
You would run for the hills,

33:07.200 --> 33:10.400
Because you love your wife And you
would never Actually cheat on her.

33:13.267 --> 33:17.267
Wow. You might just
Solve this case yet.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.901
Ok, this is not good.

33:26.968 --> 33:28.734
What's going on?
I'm doing what you asked.

33:28.801 --> 33:31.000
I'm looking at the footage To
see if i see The same person

33:31.067 --> 33:33.767
Coming back to the crime Scene
in the days After the shootings.

33:33.834 --> 33:36.567
So i find the camera With
the widest angle On the scene.

33:36.634 --> 33:38.234
So you don't have to sift
Through hundreds.

33:38.300 --> 33:39.534
Exactly, but-

33:40.634 --> 33:42.601
Someone's hacked in.

34:31.934 --> 34:32.868
Garcia.

34:32.934 --> 34:34.167
I'm on it, i'm on it.

34:34.234 --> 34:36.667
16th and broadway.
He's running east on 16th.

34:36.734 --> 34:38.900
He's headed our way.

34:50.266 --> 34:52.000
Move! Move!

34:53.900 --> 34:55.467
Get out of the way!

35:23.300 --> 35:24.567
Cooper?

35:24.634 --> 35:27.400
Garcia! We've got
An officer down.

35:27.467 --> 35:28.801
16th west of union square.

35:28.868 --> 35:30.567
Let me see.

35:30.634 --> 35:33.200
You're gonna be ok.
Garcia, can you see us?

35:33.267 --> 35:34.968
We have an officer down.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.901
Cooper, stay with me.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.701
Ok, you're gonna be ok.

35:38.767 --> 35:40.901
Cooper, stay with me.

35:54.801 --> 35:55.934
Are you ok?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.234
Is he gonna make it?

35:57.300 --> 35:58.601
I don't know.

35:58.667 --> 36:00.033
He lost
A lot of blood.

36:02.234 --> 36:04.334
He's not gonna live
To tell us anything.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.801
Any i. d. On him?

36:05.868 --> 36:06.968
Nothing.

36:07.033 --> 36:08.200
This is not good.

36:12.167 --> 36:14.133
I shouldn't have
Had to shoot him.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.200
Emily, he shot a cop.
You did what you had to do.

36:17.267 --> 36:20.033
No, no, not that. I mean, he
- He was ahead of us.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.601
He would have
Gotten away,

36:21.667 --> 36:23.133
But he stopped
And waited.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.834
So he felt trapped,
Figured he'd shoot his way out.

36:25.901 --> 36:27.000
I don't know.

36:27.067 --> 36:28.734
Tell me about
His behavior.

36:28.801 --> 36:30.834
Was he acting panicked?
Was he winded?

36:30.901 --> 36:32.434
His hands were steady.

36:32.501 --> 36:34.534
His eyes were dead calm.

36:34.601 --> 36:37.334
I mean, these guys Have
been Hyper-vigilant,

36:37.400 --> 36:39.000
Organized.

36:39.067 --> 36:40.501
They do
Pre-surveillance.

36:40.567 --> 36:43.434
I mean, what are the odds
They would shoot somebody

36:43.501 --> 36:46.100
2 blocks from where
Me and cooper are standing?

36:46.167 --> 36:48.434
You think he deliberately Shot
someone Where he could be caught?

36:48.501 --> 36:50.067
What if he did?

36:50.133 --> 36:52.033
What if they chose
This spot

36:52.100 --> 36:53.734
Because we were here?

36:53.801 --> 36:55.434
What are you thinking?

36:55.501 --> 36:57.767
He had no i. d. On him.

36:57.834 --> 37:00.300
He waited until
We caught up to him.

37:00.367 --> 37:01.968
He was strangely calm-

37:02.033 --> 37:04.234
It's almost like
Suicide by cop.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.234
Why? Why would he do that?

37:06.300 --> 37:08.267
Oh... i don't know.

37:08.334 --> 37:10.601
Maybe to make us think
Everything was finished.

37:10.667 --> 37:12.033
We need to walk back
Through this profile.

37:19.701 --> 37:22.434
We think we might have
A serious problem.

37:22.501 --> 37:23.601
What is it?

37:23.667 --> 37:24.801
We have multiple unsubs.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.234
They're disciplined.

37:26.300 --> 37:27.534
They're using
Counter-surveillance.

37:27.601 --> 37:28.934
They know the fbi
Movements.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.267
There's a hierarchy.

37:30.334 --> 37:31.868
What does that
Usually equal?

37:31.934 --> 37:33.767
Terrorism.

37:43.567 --> 37:44.834
So how does this work?

37:44.901 --> 37:46.467
The murderers simulate
A bombing.

37:46.534 --> 37:49.634
From there they station Someone to
watch and gauge Police response time.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.167
At which point they know When
to bring in A second bomb.

37:51.234 --> 37:53.501
The goal is always To take out
the first Round of civilians,

37:53.567 --> 37:55.767
Followed by a second wave
Of emergency responders.

37:55.834 --> 37:58.033
It's crazy, but it's ingenious.
They get a practice run,

37:58.100 --> 37:59.267
And if someone
Catches the shooter,

37:59.334 --> 38:00.601
They think
They just have a murderer.

38:00.667 --> 38:01.701
The cell isn't compromised.

38:01.767 --> 38:02.767
It's lo-fi.

38:02.834 --> 38:04.767
Smartest way to plan
For a terrorist event.

38:04.834 --> 38:07.634
Creating panic ensures That they
see the most Urgent response times

38:07.701 --> 38:08.901
Short of a bombing.

38:08.968 --> 38:10.367
So there's been
7 different shooters?

38:10.434 --> 38:11.868
Having followers
Do the shootings

38:11.934 --> 38:14.968
Would ensure they're willing To
kill or be killed For the cause.

38:15.033 --> 38:16.133
It fits the profile.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.067
There is something larger
At play.

38:18.133 --> 38:19.801
It's similar
To gang initiation.

38:19.868 --> 38:20.968
Especially if they're
Home-grown.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.567
They haven't had a chance
To prove themselves.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.334
I think they're targeting
Points of entry.

38:24.400 --> 38:27.234
All the murders Have taken
place near A bridge or a tunnel.

38:27.300 --> 38:30.100
Holland tunnel, midtown tunnel,
Manhattan bridge.

38:30.167 --> 38:32.133
If bombs went off, Emergency
response Would shut down

38:32.200 --> 38:34.033
Any ability to get
In or out of the city.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.767
It's like people would be
Trapped on the island.

38:35.834 --> 38:38.267
Keep in mind it's still
A theory, just like any profile.

38:41.667 --> 38:43.000
Talk to us, garcia.

38:43.067 --> 38:44.300
We got a problem.

38:44.367 --> 38:46.667
I went through and checked
All 4,468 cameras.

38:46.734 --> 38:49.167
They hacked into
The surveillance system.

38:49.234 --> 38:50.434
They've got footage
Of every crime scene.

38:50.501 --> 38:51.467
They've been watching
Since the beginning.

38:51.534 --> 38:53.000
How could we
Not have caught that?

38:53.067 --> 38:54.667
They were smart.
It wasn't system-wide.

38:54.734 --> 38:56.167
You had to check
Each camera individually.

38:56.234 --> 38:57.767
And this is from
Every crime scene?

38:57.834 --> 38:58.868
I'm afraid so.

38:58.934 --> 39:02.133
They hacked into
One camera at every scene.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.567
Thanks, garcia.

39:03.634 --> 39:04.868
So much for theory.

39:06.267 --> 39:07.534
We need to hit
The ground running.

39:07.601 --> 39:09.033
I'm gonna head
To the hospital.

39:09.100 --> 39:10.634
I'll check on cooper
And brief detective brustin.

39:10.701 --> 39:12.400
Good. Dave, will you
Go talk to the commissioner,

39:12.467 --> 39:14.367
And, morgan, you brief
Homeland security.

39:14.434 --> 39:15.934
Jj and i will talk to
The port authority police.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.234
Kate and i will go talk
To the mayor

39:17.300 --> 39:18.634
And we'll meet back here
As soon as possible.

39:18.701 --> 39:20.133
One advantage
That we have right now

39:20.200 --> 39:22.634
Is that they don't know
We know they're watching.

39:38.033 --> 39:39.234
Agent jareau.

39:40.534 --> 39:42.267
Thank you.

39:46.334 --> 39:47.567
From will?

39:49.234 --> 39:52.567
He's going home
To new orleans tonight.

39:52.634 --> 39:54.334
You ok?

39:56.567 --> 39:58.834
He doesn't want
To be in the way.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.934
He's quitting his job?

40:08.400 --> 40:11.234
Do you need everyone
In the field?

40:11.300 --> 40:14.601
Reid, you can go brief Port
authority police By yourself.

40:14.667 --> 40:16.434
Jj, you run point
From the office.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.801
Why don't you go back To the
hotel, Tell will what's going on,

40:18.868 --> 40:19.934
And then get back here
Straight away.

40:20.033 --> 40:23.267
And jj...
Yes, sir.

40:23.334 --> 40:25.234
Congratulations.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.400
How's cooper doing?

40:42.467 --> 40:43.834
He's still in surgery.

40:43.901 --> 40:45.400
It doesn't look good.

40:47.567 --> 40:50.601
We think we know
What this is about.
