01:16.323 --> 01:18.457
All right, everybody,
give me your attention.

01:18.459 --> 01:20.126
If you should happen
to come across

01:20.128 --> 01:21.761
a distinctive
gold locket...

01:24.198 --> 01:26.165
Engraved with the letters
e and c on its face.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.567
It might have pictures
of a man

01:28.569 --> 01:31.337
and a little girl
on the inside.

01:31.339 --> 01:36.008
Is anyone acquainted
with a sailor named.

01:36.010 --> 01:38.778
McClaugherty?

01:38.780 --> 01:40.880
Tungus McClaugherty.

01:40.882 --> 01:43.482
Used to live
on Mulberry Bend.

01:43.484 --> 01:46.986
Tungus McClaugherty.

01:51.525 --> 01:53.526
Ah, Julius.

01:53.528 --> 01:54.860
Seeing you,

01:54.862 --> 01:56.929
my morning
is complete.

01:56.931 --> 01:58.564
Your presence is
requested, detective.

02:12.013 --> 02:14.213
Most of the irishmen
in the New York regiments

02:14.215 --> 02:17.149
were bloodthirsty street
criminals before the war

02:17.151 --> 02:18.884
and they've returned to
our great city even worse.

02:18.886 --> 02:20.386
Cheer up, Winnie.

02:20.388 --> 02:22.321
A lot of the Irish
got killed.

02:22.323 --> 02:24.156
Oh, and just think about
the emancipated negroes

02:24.158 --> 02:25.658
who will flock here.

02:25.660 --> 02:27.159
The Irish
and the heinies

02:27.161 --> 02:29.628
will slaughter
the poor creatures.

02:29.630 --> 02:31.130
New York will burn.
Again.

02:31.132 --> 02:32.665
We're not going to let
that happen, are we?

02:32.667 --> 02:35.001
Thoughtful men believe
that urban growth

02:35.003 --> 02:36.502
can be controlled

02:36.504 --> 02:38.270
by scientific method
and careful planning,

02:38.272 --> 02:40.740
though there are
those who hold that

02:40.742 --> 02:43.109
the plight of the poor
is their own doing.

02:43.111 --> 02:45.277
Your father,
for one.

02:45.279 --> 02:47.079
Yes, my father.

02:54.255 --> 02:56.789
Detective Corcoran,
sir.

02:56.791 --> 02:59.492
What brings you
here, Corky?

02:59.494 --> 03:02.128
I sent for him.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.430
I didn't think
he'd come to my home,

03:04.432 --> 03:06.799
if summoned.

03:06.801 --> 03:09.135
I inquired at St. Brenda's
about the girl, Annie?

03:09.137 --> 03:11.971
And the nuns
there told me

03:11.973 --> 03:14.507
she wasn't there.

03:14.509 --> 03:17.276
Never been there.

03:17.278 --> 03:20.112
My mistake.

03:20.114 --> 03:22.548
Why do you care about
that little tramp so much?

03:22.550 --> 03:24.316
Why do you?

03:24.318 --> 03:26.352
Corky, may I apologize,
for Winnie?

03:26.354 --> 03:29.288
Of course you may.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.790
Winnie still hasn't
forgiven you

03:30.792 --> 03:32.291
for accusing him
of the murder

03:32.293 --> 03:34.193
of Annie Reilly's
sister.

03:34.195 --> 03:36.295
Julius will take you
wherever you need to go.

03:36.297 --> 03:38.798
Thank you, major.
Good day.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.200
I'm not done
with you, Corcoran.

03:41.202 --> 03:43.736
Oh, we're done,
"Winnie."

04:01.985 --> 04:04.156
Francis will stay here
and keep guard until I

04:04.158 --> 04:06.425
can figure out another
place to hide you.

04:06.427 --> 04:07.859
Are you sure
Mr. Haverford

04:07.861 --> 04:09.328
is coming for me?

04:09.330 --> 04:10.596
Yes, darlin'.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.097
Don't you worry
about the child.

04:12.099 --> 04:13.599
Molly and me
will protect her.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.067
"Molly and me"?
Any word from Eva?

04:16.070 --> 04:17.702
She made the trip
to New Orleans

04:17.704 --> 04:21.106
without incident. Should
be back by week's end.

04:21.108 --> 04:22.441
Now, Francis!

04:22.443 --> 04:24.943
I will reward you
later.

04:24.945 --> 04:28.347
Once we have completed
our solemn trust...

04:28.349 --> 04:32.718
the safety
of dear Annie.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.219
But several men have
already been here

04:34.221 --> 04:35.721
in search of
your Annie Reilly.

04:35.723 --> 04:37.222
Which is why
this is now

04:37.224 --> 04:38.724
the perfect place
to hide the girl...

04:38.726 --> 04:40.225
they'd never think
to come back.

04:40.227 --> 04:41.727
Kevin Corcoran, you were
a troublesome child

04:41.729 --> 04:43.228
and you've become
a troublesome adult.

04:43.230 --> 04:44.730
I won't put
my charges in peril.

04:44.732 --> 04:47.232
But, sister
Agnes clare...

04:47.234 --> 04:50.102
what do I
always say?

04:50.104 --> 04:52.738
"A no is a no
is a no."

04:52.740 --> 04:54.172
But Annie's
in real danger.

04:54.174 --> 04:55.607
Well, you're
a copper.

04:55.609 --> 04:57.009
Shield her
from the danger.

04:57.011 --> 04:59.444
I'm trying.

04:59.446 --> 05:01.680
Have you been
to mass lately,

05:01.682 --> 05:03.248
prayed to the almighty
for help?

05:12.625 --> 05:15.560
News from the
Shenandoah valley!

05:15.562 --> 05:18.063
General Sheridan has allowed
Jubal Early's confederates

05:18.065 --> 05:19.765
to escape annihilation.

05:19.767 --> 05:22.067
You have an informant
in the white house?

05:22.069 --> 05:24.469
We've informants in
Grant's headquarters.

05:24.471 --> 05:27.339
We learn the goings-on
before Mr. Lincoln.

05:27.341 --> 05:28.840
Buy gold at 1.60.

05:28.842 --> 05:30.342
Well, the graycoats
may have escaped, but,

05:30.344 --> 05:31.843
on Monday, they
suffered heavy losses

05:31.845 --> 05:33.478
at Opequon creek,
and that can only help

05:33.480 --> 05:34.980
Lincoln's chances
for reelection.

05:34.982 --> 05:36.682
There are many battles
to be fought

05:36.684 --> 05:38.617
between now
and November.

05:38.619 --> 05:40.786
If there is
another antietam...

05:40.788 --> 05:45.691
father, general Early's
still on the move.

05:45.693 --> 05:48.026
You bought gold
at 1.55?

05:48.028 --> 05:49.661
1.60.

05:49.663 --> 05:52.698
How often
must I remind you?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.733
When the union suffers
a loss, northerners

05:54.735 --> 05:56.535
get insecure and buy
precious metals.

05:56.537 --> 05:59.104
Tomorrow, gold will be
1.80, at least.

05:59.106 --> 06:01.707
You've cut my profit
by a third.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.208
Thank you for coming,
Haverford.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.710
An invitation
to discuss business

06:04.712 --> 06:07.379
with the Morehouse
family is...

06:07.381 --> 06:08.880
The sixth ward.

06:08.882 --> 06:10.549
I want to buy
Five Points,

06:10.551 --> 06:12.751
from Chatham
to Canal to Elm,

06:12.753 --> 06:14.252
all 20 blocks,

06:14.254 --> 06:15.754
including
Paradise Square.

06:15.756 --> 06:18.724
Buy Five Points?
Why?

06:18.726 --> 06:20.492
That...
that neighborhood

06:20.494 --> 06:21.993
is filled with
horrible slums and...

06:21.995 --> 06:24.329
clearly, your friend
lacks vision.

06:26.532 --> 06:28.200
Good day, sir.

06:34.907 --> 06:36.408
H-how did I
offend him?

06:36.410 --> 06:37.909
Father believes
all that acreage,

06:37.911 --> 06:40.579
so close to Wall Street,
cannot be left fallow.

06:40.581 --> 06:42.214
But the Irish,
Bavarians, Italians...

06:42.216 --> 06:43.715
they're all packed in
to Five Points.

06:43.717 --> 06:45.183
Father also believes

06:45.185 --> 06:46.618
that displacing
the foreign element

06:46.620 --> 06:48.053
will help to decrease
vice and disorder.

06:48.055 --> 06:50.455
Well, my wife and I have
donated to the rebuilding

06:50.457 --> 06:52.290
of the colored
orphan asylum,

06:52.292 --> 06:53.792
in hopes of improving
the lives

06:53.794 --> 06:55.293
of freed slaves
and immigrants.

06:55.295 --> 06:57.329
Father doesn't want to
eradicate the immigrants,

06:57.331 --> 06:59.364
he simply wants them
to move to Hoboken.

06:59.366 --> 07:01.133
I see.

07:01.135 --> 07:02.667
And he wants me
to...?

07:02.669 --> 07:04.603
If it becomes known
that we Morehouses

07:04.605 --> 07:06.538
are buying large
parcels of land,

07:06.540 --> 07:08.273
prices will soar.

07:08.275 --> 07:09.841
We are asking certain
trusted friends

07:09.843 --> 07:11.376
to make
the acquisitions,

07:11.378 --> 07:13.044
with our money,

07:13.046 --> 07:16.214
in a joint venture.

07:16.216 --> 07:18.784
Well I'm honored
to be included.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.218
I don't think honor

07:20.220 --> 07:21.653
has anything
to do with this.

07:35.067 --> 07:36.735
The air
is beautiful!

07:36.737 --> 07:38.303
It's fresh.

07:38.305 --> 07:39.838
Much better
than Five Points.

07:42.241 --> 07:44.576
Maybe later,
we can go for a walk.

07:49.615 --> 07:53.118
Sara.

08:00.660 --> 08:02.761
We left Five Points

08:02.763 --> 08:05.063
so you wouldn't be
afraid to go outside.

08:10.236 --> 08:12.637
I saw white men
outside on horses.

08:12.639 --> 08:14.272
Well, white men
have a right

08:14.274 --> 08:20.412
to ride on that road,
same as we do.

08:20.414 --> 08:22.614
You can protect me
with your pistol.

08:22.616 --> 08:25.183
You're
an excellent shot.

08:36.828 --> 08:38.330
When the orphanage

08:38.332 --> 08:40.298
was destroyed
by that vicious mob.

08:40.299 --> 08:43.969
We thank Winfred
and Elizabeth Haverford

08:43.971 --> 08:47.038
for financing
the renovation

08:47.040 --> 08:50.275
of this old mansion
into a safe, new shelter

08:50.277 --> 08:54.379
for the many
children in need.

08:55.581 --> 09:01.453
♪ Wade in the water

09:01.455 --> 09:02.954
♪ wade in the water,
children ♪

09:02.956 --> 09:04.689
Oh!

09:04.691 --> 09:06.791
Thank you
so much!

09:06.793 --> 09:09.761
Thank you.

09:09.763 --> 09:11.596
With so many of our
young men down South,

09:11.598 --> 09:13.098
fighting for
the negroes' freedom,

09:13.100 --> 09:14.933
I feel
a sacred duty

09:14.935 --> 09:16.635
to help
the less fortunate.

09:16.637 --> 09:18.136
Well, may God
bless you

09:18.138 --> 09:19.671
and your good deeds,
Mr. Haverford.

09:19.673 --> 09:21.640
Yes,

09:21.642 --> 09:24.075
may God repay Winfred
for all his deeds.

09:24.077 --> 09:25.410
Thank you.

09:30.399 --> 09:33.601
Corky!

09:33.603 --> 09:35.102
We had a visitor.

09:35.104 --> 09:36.704
Who, Haverford?

09:36.706 --> 09:38.839
Tungus McClaugherty. He came
here looking for pleasure

09:38.841 --> 09:40.208
after all that time at sea,
but, when he saw Maguire,

09:40.210 --> 09:41.576
he ran like
the devil himself

09:41.578 --> 09:43.578
reared up
out of nowhere.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.079
Tell Francis I'm off
to track down McClaugherty.

09:45.081 --> 09:47.548
Where will you look?

09:47.550 --> 09:49.817
A rat always returns
to where there's cheese.

10:12.075 --> 10:14.208
What the hell are you
doing back here, McClaugherty?!

10:14.210 --> 10:15.743
Oh, move aside
! What are you doing back here?!

10:15.745 --> 10:17.745
Move aside, or I'll
kick your head in!

10:17.747 --> 10:19.880
- Get off!
- Ah!

10:22.150 --> 10:23.651
Ooh!

10:23.653 --> 10:26.220
Welcome back, McClaugherty.
Hit him again, Corky!

10:26.222 --> 10:28.256
I see you're back to steal.
I didn't steal!

10:28.258 --> 10:30.424
Sneaking into a poor
widow's home,

10:30.426 --> 10:32.460
taking
her belongings!

10:32.462 --> 10:33.661
I only took <i>my</i>
<i>belongings, you old...</i>

10:33.663 --> 10:35.596
ow! Stop it.
You're lying!

10:35.598 --> 10:38.833
Let 'er rip,
Corky.

10:38.835 --> 10:41.135
Whip the bootlicking
bastard Tungus McClaugherty

10:41.137 --> 10:43.471
until he's deader
than a...!

10:43.473 --> 10:45.273
Scallywag comes
into my home,

10:45.275 --> 10:47.108
turns it into
a goddamn hair pit!

10:47.110 --> 10:49.677
You give me that gun, Kevin!
Get out!

10:49.679 --> 10:51.579
And I'll throw a whole mess
of hornets into the prick!

10:51.581 --> 10:53.447
He deserves a hanging!
Where's my wife?

10:53.449 --> 10:55.783
I don't know.

10:55.785 --> 10:56.951
You didn't run off
with her?

10:56.953 --> 10:58.853
No! No!
You didn't bed her?

10:58.855 --> 11:00.921
No! Oh!

11:00.923 --> 11:02.423
But you killed my little
girl, didn't you?

11:02.425 --> 11:04.458
No, no! I swear to you,
I never did anything

11:04.460 --> 11:06.060
to your wife,
or your daughter!

11:08.530 --> 11:10.564
But you were there
that night, right?

11:10.566 --> 11:13.100
I didn't come in
until after Ellen left

11:13.102 --> 11:14.468
with some fella.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.304
Who?
Which fella?

11:16.306 --> 11:17.605
I didn't see a face!
It was dark!

11:17.607 --> 11:19.940
I waited 'til they were
gone before I broke in.

11:21.610 --> 11:24.845
I saw your daughter
laying on the floor,

11:24.847 --> 11:26.180
already dead.

11:26.182 --> 11:28.616
Sir, I couldn't get out
of here fast enough.

11:28.618 --> 11:30.484
I shipped out on the first
boat I could find.

11:30.486 --> 11:32.820
The locket. Did you
steal Ellen's locket?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.522
I saw no locket.

11:34.524 --> 11:36.190
Well, when you saw Maggie, why
didn't you go to the police?

11:36.192 --> 11:37.692
I was afraid
they'd think

11:37.694 --> 11:39.527
I had something to do
with Maggie's murder.

11:39.529 --> 11:40.761
Wait! Wait!

11:40.763 --> 11:42.196
I swear, I never
touched your daughter!

11:42.198 --> 11:44.565
If I killed her,
why wouldn't I

11:44.567 --> 11:46.067
have killed
your wife, too?

11:51.341 --> 11:54.075
Ah, tare an'ouns, you
let McClaugherty go free?

11:54.077 --> 11:55.609
He told me every
scrap he knows,

11:55.611 --> 11:57.144
which wasn't much.

11:57.146 --> 11:58.512
He swears he had
nothing to do with.

11:58.514 --> 12:00.081
Maggie's death or Ellen's
disappearance, so.

12:00.083 --> 12:01.816
Man's a lying sack
of manure.

12:01.818 --> 12:03.317
No, I believe him.

12:03.319 --> 12:04.885
Jesus Christ,
why?

12:04.887 --> 12:07.521
Because, when he
told me what he did,

12:07.523 --> 12:09.390
his eyes relaxed.

12:09.392 --> 12:10.925
Confession
refreshes the soul.

12:10.927 --> 12:13.027
Does it?

12:13.029 --> 12:15.096
Time for you to go
back to Eva's,

12:15.098 --> 12:16.597
relieve O'Brien
in guarding Annie.

12:16.599 --> 12:18.099
Can you do that?
I can.

12:18.101 --> 12:20.201
We don't want O'Brien's
wife beating on him again.

12:26.541 --> 12:28.042
Where are you
with the purchase

12:28.044 --> 12:29.577
of the Mother Ame
zion church?

12:29.579 --> 12:31.379
Well, I've spoken with
the reverend Garland.

12:31.381 --> 12:32.813
He seems amenable
to a sale

12:32.815 --> 12:34.315
and he needs only
discuss it with

12:34.317 --> 12:35.816
the church elders
and then, I think

12:35.818 --> 12:38.853
I can get it
for $100,000...

12:38.855 --> 12:44.024
father, I see you have
a new clerk.

12:45.595 --> 12:47.161
Tell me, Winnie,

12:47.163 --> 12:49.697
how goes the search
for little Annie?

12:49.699 --> 12:51.365
Have you persuaded
Corcoran

12:51.367 --> 12:53.734
to help you
find her?

12:53.736 --> 12:55.603
Your friend Corcoran
is beneath contempt.

12:55.605 --> 12:57.738
Which puts him
one level

12:57.740 --> 13:00.107
above you.

13:00.109 --> 13:01.742
If you weren't
Norbert's son,

13:01.744 --> 13:03.844
I would give you
a good thrashing.

13:03.846 --> 13:06.046
But you would, if I
was his <i>daughter.</i>

13:06.048 --> 13:07.815
We're doing
business, Robert.

13:07.817 --> 13:10.317
Why don't you lay down
and sleep off your drunk?

13:10.319 --> 13:14.388
An excellent idea.

13:14.390 --> 13:16.390
I always do
what father tells me.

13:25.568 --> 13:27.401
Do you drink,
Haverford?

13:27.403 --> 13:30.204
Not a drop.

13:30.206 --> 13:31.705
Robert's mother
drank spirits,

13:31.707 --> 13:35.209
until she
became one.

13:35.211 --> 13:37.845
I fear he will follow
her example.

13:37.847 --> 13:39.346
I hooked a big one
last night.

13:39.348 --> 13:41.916
He gave me 5 extra
dollars, 5 extra.

13:41.918 --> 13:43.617
Excuse me.

13:43.619 --> 13:45.019
I'm looking
for a detective

13:45.021 --> 13:46.420
by the name of
Corcoran.

13:46.422 --> 13:49.056
Tch, information
like that's expensive.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.901
I don't know
where he is.

14:00.903 --> 14:02.403
But, I'm sure
he'll show up here,

14:02.405 --> 14:03.904
sooner or later.

14:03.906 --> 14:06.407
Meanwhile,
you want a kiss?

14:06.409 --> 14:09.410
I do not have a taste
for harlots, ma'am.

14:09.412 --> 14:11.212
I'm a godfearing
christian.

14:19.087 --> 14:20.588
I find
that the Irish...

14:20.590 --> 14:22.890
at least,
the women...

14:22.892 --> 14:25.726
to be <i>deeply</i> committed
to their faith

14:25.728 --> 14:28.462
and yet, despite
our efforts,

14:28.464 --> 14:31.966
the men remain
to be uneducated,

14:31.968 --> 14:33.801
superstitious,
violent.

14:33.803 --> 14:35.169
There are people
of our class

14:35.171 --> 14:36.537
who are far worse.

14:36.539 --> 14:42.443
My husband,
for example.

14:42.445 --> 14:45.446
Tell me about
Kevin Corcoran.

14:45.448 --> 14:47.314
Is he prone
to violence?

14:47.316 --> 14:49.717
Yes, but he has

14:49.719 --> 14:51.285
an inherent nobility
inside him.

14:51.287 --> 14:52.419
Oh.

14:52.421 --> 14:54.355
Corky came from Ireland
when he was just a boy,

14:54.357 --> 14:55.789
learned to be
a boxer,

14:55.791 --> 14:57.691
and was quite a fierce
force in the ring.

14:57.693 --> 14:59.793
Yes, I can see that
from his physique.

14:59.795 --> 15:01.362
When the rebellion
broke out,

15:01.364 --> 15:02.863
he volunteered
to fight

15:02.865 --> 15:05.332
and did so bravely for
over four brutal years.

15:05.334 --> 15:07.801
Then, he found out
his wife had disappeared

15:07.803 --> 15:09.637
and his daughter
had been murdered.

15:09.639 --> 15:11.171
Oh, my lord.

15:11.173 --> 15:12.673
The union army
forced Corky

15:12.675 --> 15:14.174
to continue
his service,

15:14.176 --> 15:15.676
until
two months ago,

15:15.678 --> 15:17.177
when he and I
were mustered out.

15:17.179 --> 15:18.779
Since then,
he's been obsessed

15:18.781 --> 15:21.515
with finding
the girl's killer.

15:21.517 --> 15:23.017
Then I'm certain
that he will.

15:23.019 --> 15:24.518
Dear lady, I didn't
ask you for this stroll

15:24.520 --> 15:26.654
to talk about
Kevin Corcoran.

15:26.656 --> 15:28.923
I know it,
discussing business

15:28.925 --> 15:30.424
with a woman
is unseemly, but...

15:30.426 --> 15:31.926
oh. Robert, I hope
you're aware, by now,

15:31.928 --> 15:34.962
that I am not some
dullwitted debutante.

15:34.964 --> 15:36.230
No.

15:36.232 --> 15:37.731
You are
quite unique.

15:37.733 --> 15:38.732
Hmm.

15:38.734 --> 15:40.601
Your husband has asked
reverend Garland

15:40.603 --> 15:42.102
to sell him
the acreage on which

15:42.104 --> 15:43.604
the Mother Ame
zion church stands.

15:43.606 --> 15:44.605
Yes.

15:44.607 --> 15:46.106
This is part
of my father's

15:46.108 --> 15:47.641
grand scheme to buy
all of Five Points.

15:47.643 --> 15:49.343
And?

15:49.345 --> 15:50.844
I wish
to thwart him.

15:50.846 --> 15:52.179
I see.

15:52.181 --> 15:53.781
And how may I be
of assistance?

15:53.783 --> 15:55.950
I would like you
to buy the property.

15:55.952 --> 15:57.318
With my money.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.955
And in doing so,
you thwart you father

16:00.957 --> 16:04.725
and I thwart
Winfred.

16:04.727 --> 16:06.060
I agree.

16:45.834 --> 16:49.737
Goodnight, ladies.

17:02.851 --> 17:04.385
Where's the girl,
copper?

17:07.088 --> 17:09.289
St. Brenda's convent.

17:16.698 --> 17:17.931
Ah! Oh!

17:17.933 --> 17:19.333
Ohh!

17:26.473 --> 17:28.509
Tell us
where Annie is.

17:30.445 --> 17:33.147
Now.

17:33.149 --> 17:34.915
Come on,

17:34.917 --> 17:37.051
we both know
a Pinkerton detective

17:37.053 --> 17:38.552
ain't gonna shoot
a cop.

17:42.457 --> 17:44.725
Oh! Uh!

17:46.728 --> 17:49.063
Ohh!

17:49.065 --> 17:51.398
Get off!

17:51.400 --> 17:52.900
No! No!

17:53.968 --> 17:55.169
No!

17:55.171 --> 17:58.472
Aaaaaah!

18:01.243 --> 18:04.111
Now,

18:04.113 --> 18:07.414
either you tell us
where you hid the girl,

18:07.416 --> 18:08.749
or your arms
are next.

18:10.185 --> 18:12.119
Aah!

18:12.121 --> 18:14.021
You have 5 seconds
to get out,

18:14.023 --> 18:16.356
or I start firing.

18:16.358 --> 18:19.793
And I'm
a quick shot.

18:19.795 --> 18:21.361
Easy.

18:21.363 --> 18:23.931
Ahh!

18:23.933 --> 18:25.632
Ahhh! Ah.

18:27.035 --> 18:28.569
Agh.

18:35.401 --> 18:36.968
First thing in the morning.
Kevin!

18:36.970 --> 18:39.003
Can you hear me?
Kevin.

18:39.005 --> 18:40.271
Oh!

18:40.273 --> 18:42.473
Who did this to you?!
Who did this to you?

18:42.475 --> 18:44.409
Oh, Haverford.
Haverford.

18:44.411 --> 18:45.610
He must've hired
some Pinkertons.

18:45.612 --> 18:47.645
Are they still here?
No, I don't think so.

18:47.647 --> 18:49.147
They broke my leg!
They broke my leg.

18:49.149 --> 18:50.448
Watch over him
while I'm gone.

18:50.450 --> 18:51.849
I'll get a doctor.

18:51.851 --> 18:54.552
Get Freeman.
Get Freeman.

18:54.554 --> 18:56.454
Hurry!

19:00.626 --> 19:04.195
Wait here.

19:56.148 --> 19:58.382
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

19:58.384 --> 20:00.251
I mean you
no harm!

20:00.253 --> 20:01.786
Sara?

20:05.157 --> 20:07.658
Sara,
all is well.

20:11.196 --> 20:14.398
Phew.
Mother of Christ!

20:14.400 --> 20:16.267
It's all right.
You can come out now.

20:16.269 --> 20:18.269
Your arms are going to
hurt for about a day,

20:18.271 --> 20:19.770
but a little pain
now is better

20:19.772 --> 20:22.173
than getting
the smallpox, hmm?

20:22.175 --> 20:24.842
You're all right.
Hang in there.

20:24.844 --> 20:25.843
Agh!

20:25.845 --> 20:28.513
You're all right.

20:28.515 --> 20:29.780
Uhrr!

20:29.782 --> 20:31.449
All right.

20:31.451 --> 20:33.351
Ahhh!

20:33.353 --> 20:35.920
Shh.

20:35.922 --> 20:37.922
Here we go.
You're all right.

20:37.924 --> 20:39.390
Okay, just hold him.

20:39.392 --> 20:41.359
Hold him. Hold him.
Don't... hold him.

20:41.361 --> 20:42.393
Oh!

20:42.395 --> 20:44.695
Agh!

20:44.697 --> 20:45.696
Uhrr!

20:45.698 --> 20:47.031
You're okay.

20:47.033 --> 20:48.633
All right. Okay.

20:48.635 --> 20:52.236
You're all right.

20:52.238 --> 20:54.772
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

20:54.774 --> 20:55.773
Freeman!

20:55.775 --> 20:57.308
Give me something,
Freeman!

20:57.310 --> 20:59.076
Come on.
Hang in there.

20:59.078 --> 21:02.713
All right.
Come on.

21:02.715 --> 21:04.916
Come on, Kevin.
There you go.

21:04.918 --> 21:06.117
Ah.

21:06.119 --> 21:07.952
Nice and easy.
There we are.

21:07.954 --> 21:10.755
There we are.

21:10.757 --> 21:12.890
The pain should go away
soon, all right?

21:12.892 --> 21:14.392
Just take it easy.

21:14.394 --> 21:17.929
Okay? Nice and easy.
You're okay.

21:22.968 --> 21:24.936
No pain.

21:24.938 --> 21:26.270
No shit.

21:30.108 --> 21:31.609
I'll watch
the other door.

21:31.611 --> 21:34.612
Aye.

21:39.618 --> 21:42.019
Who are ya?
Hmm?

21:42.021 --> 21:44.655
John Reilly, sir.

21:44.657 --> 21:47.458
I was told det
Corcoran might know

21:47.460 --> 21:48.793
the whereabouts of
my daughter Annie.

21:51.029 --> 21:52.263
After you.

22:00.205 --> 22:01.839
At the 6th precinct,

22:01.841 --> 22:04.175
they told me that
my daughter Kate

22:04.177 --> 22:05.876
was murdered
in a cathouse.

22:05.878 --> 22:07.778
My condolences,

22:07.780 --> 22:09.146
Mr. Reilly.

22:09.148 --> 22:10.815
A sip of whiskey?

22:10.817 --> 22:12.249
I don't usually
imbibe, but,

22:12.251 --> 22:14.118
given the
circumstances...

22:25.764 --> 22:28.966
Did the bastard
who killed Kate

22:28.968 --> 22:30.434
violate her?

22:30.436 --> 22:32.103
The doctor said
she died a virgin.

22:32.105 --> 22:34.338
The almighty
is merciful.

22:34.340 --> 22:36.207
The almighty

22:36.209 --> 22:38.142
could've showed Kate
a touch more mercy.

22:40.579 --> 22:42.947
I have a farm
up in Westchester

22:42.949 --> 22:45.116
and, just...
it keeps me busy

22:45.118 --> 22:47.718
so after
my wife died,

22:47.720 --> 22:50.154
the girls, Kate
and Annie, well...

22:50.156 --> 22:51.656
I didn't know how

22:51.658 --> 22:53.624
to raise
two young girls.

22:53.626 --> 22:55.893
Last year,
Annie told me

22:55.895 --> 22:58.062
she wanted to go
to New York

22:58.064 --> 22:59.563
to become a whore.

22:59.565 --> 23:00.898
Your daughter
told you

23:00.900 --> 23:02.233
that she wanted
to become a whore?

23:02.235 --> 23:04.168
As Annie's father,
it's my duty

23:04.170 --> 23:05.670
to bring her back
to the righteous path.

23:05.672 --> 23:07.838
And why didn't you
do that sooner?

23:07.840 --> 23:09.640
I was grieving
the death of my wife.

23:09.642 --> 23:11.142
I'm sure
you can understand

23:11.144 --> 23:12.643
what a man
goes through.

23:18.050 --> 23:20.151
I went to St. Brenda's
convent to find her,

23:20.153 --> 23:21.919
but she wasn't there.

23:21.921 --> 23:23.421
My superiors
are keeping

23:23.423 --> 23:25.389
your daughter's
whereabouts a secret.

23:25.391 --> 23:27.358
They're afraid that
the men who killed Kate

23:27.360 --> 23:28.859
might be looking
for Annie.

23:28.861 --> 23:30.127
I'm her father.

23:30.129 --> 23:32.496
P-please, just tell me
where she is.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.865
I don't know where.

23:34.867 --> 23:36.434
They're keeping it
a secret from me as well.

23:36.436 --> 23:39.570
For her
own protection.

23:39.572 --> 23:41.806
Take Mr. Reilly
to Kate's grave.

23:41.808 --> 23:43.374
So you can, uh,

23:43.376 --> 23:46.410
show your respects.

23:46.412 --> 23:48.846
Thank you, detective.

23:48.848 --> 23:50.981
Oh, wait out front
a moment, will you?

23:58.623 --> 24:02.426
Hey, did you see him when
I tossed him the bottle,

24:02.428 --> 24:03.928
how he caught it and
the long sip he took?

24:03.930 --> 24:05.262
Mm-hmm.

24:05.264 --> 24:07.465
Man's bellied up
to many a bar before.

24:07.467 --> 24:09.900
Oh, Reilly's
a liar.

24:09.902 --> 24:11.602
Get him out of town
on the next ferry.

24:17.309 --> 24:19.543
Oh, Andrew,

24:19.545 --> 24:21.645
bring Molly
and Annie to me.

24:21.647 --> 24:23.147
And, on the way
back,

24:23.149 --> 24:24.648
make sure no one
recognizes the girl.

24:34.426 --> 24:36.827
Having heard that
our congregation

24:36.829 --> 24:38.329
is soon
to move uptown,

24:38.331 --> 24:39.830
your husband <i>has</i>
<i>made overtures</i>

24:39.832 --> 24:41.398
about buying
our current church.

24:41.400 --> 24:45.836
He says he wants to
tear down the building

24:45.838 --> 24:47.671
and replace it
with a park.

24:47.673 --> 24:49.573
Yes, winfred
is ever-thoughtful,

24:49.575 --> 24:51.308
but what I
would like to do

24:51.310 --> 24:53.477
is surprise him...
buy the land myself

24:53.479 --> 24:55.346
and build a park
in his name.

24:55.348 --> 24:57.047
I see. Oh.

24:57.049 --> 24:58.749
Please,

24:58.751 --> 25:00.251
help me give
my husband

25:00.253 --> 25:02.453
the surprise
of his life.

25:02.455 --> 25:05.689
Anything for you,
dear lady.

25:08.994 --> 25:11.695
Your father's
not dead.

25:11.697 --> 25:14.965
He was here today,
looking for you.

25:14.967 --> 25:16.467
Mr. Reilly
was here?

25:16.469 --> 25:19.537
Mm-hmm.

25:19.539 --> 25:22.106
So why'd you lie
and say he was dead?

25:22.108 --> 25:26.110
Mr. Reilly's
not my father.

25:27.813 --> 25:30.481
He's my husband.

25:41.626 --> 25:43.127
My mum left me
and Kate

25:43.129 --> 25:45.696
with Mr. Reilly
when I was nine.

25:45.698 --> 25:48.165
When I turned 10,
he married me.

25:48.167 --> 25:49.767
Claimed it was
the law of the land

25:49.769 --> 25:51.268
and I had to.

25:51.270 --> 25:55.372
The law says
a girl <i>can</i> consent

25:55.374 --> 25:56.874
to marry a man when
she's 10 years old.

25:56.876 --> 25:59.543
The law doesn't <i>force</i>
<i>a girl to marry.</i>

25:59.545 --> 26:02.413
That's what
the Contessa said.

26:02.415 --> 26:04.014
She said, instead,
I could have

26:04.016 --> 26:07.518
a warm room at her
house and chocolates,

26:07.520 --> 26:09.019
for doing
the same things.

26:09.021 --> 26:11.355
Mr. Reilly
made me do.

26:11.357 --> 26:15.092
She swore to me that
the man would be nice,

26:15.094 --> 26:19.163
but he wasn't.

26:19.165 --> 26:20.965
Please
don't send me back

26:20.967 --> 26:23.000
to Mr. Reilly.

26:23.002 --> 26:27.538
Oh.
Shh! Shh!

26:33.511 --> 26:36.280
Look,

26:36.282 --> 26:38.883
I promise
to never do that,

26:38.885 --> 26:41.886
all right?

26:41.888 --> 26:44.688
I'd like to give that
bastard a good wumping.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.957
Hand me a shillelagh.
I'll help.

26:46.959 --> 26:48.826
Andrew, take
Annie upstairs

26:48.828 --> 26:50.461
and tell her a story,
will you?

26:54.699 --> 26:56.233
I'm going to
tell you

26:56.235 --> 26:58.135
about "the dream
of Aengus"

26:58.137 --> 26:59.637
and "the wooing
of Etain."

27:05.443 --> 27:08.312
Get
some rest, honey.

27:17.756 --> 27:19.256
That poor waif.

27:19.258 --> 27:21.959
First, forced to marry;
Then, to sell herself.

27:21.961 --> 27:24.328
Listen, Molly,
we need to move Annie.

27:24.330 --> 27:25.829
Haverford's hired
Pinkertons and they

27:25.831 --> 27:27.331
should be showing up
at eva's soon.

27:31.036 --> 27:34.004
I'll take the girl
anywhere you say.

27:34.006 --> 27:35.506
I'll help you
any way I can,

27:35.508 --> 27:38.642
but it seems to me,
the solution is

27:38.644 --> 27:40.711
you need to stop
Haverford

27:40.713 --> 27:42.313
from hurting Annie,
or any other children!

27:42.315 --> 27:45.215
Oh, yeah, yeah? How am I
supposed to do that,

27:45.217 --> 27:47.051
shoot him dead in
the middle of Broadway?

27:50.855 --> 27:56.460
You're a clever
one, Corky.

27:56.462 --> 27:58.629
You'll figure
something out.

27:58.631 --> 27:59.830
Don't do that.

27:59.832 --> 28:01.799
What do you mean,
don't?

28:01.801 --> 28:04.268
Feels like this is
exactly what you need.

28:04.270 --> 28:06.437
Mmm.

28:06.439 --> 28:08.806
Do you want me
to stop?

28:12.210 --> 28:13.877
No.

28:21.109 --> 28:24.412
My sweet Kate,
gone forever.

28:24.414 --> 28:26.013
She's with
the angels now.

28:30.052 --> 28:33.254
I'll take you
to the dock,

28:33.256 --> 28:35.556
get you on
the 7:00 ferry.

28:35.558 --> 28:38.492
Oh, I can't leave.

28:38.494 --> 28:40.027
I have to find
my sweet Annie.

28:40.029 --> 28:41.629
Not gonna happen,
Reilly.

28:41.631 --> 28:43.197
But I'm
her father.

28:43.199 --> 28:44.732
You mean
her husband?

28:44.734 --> 28:45.833
Ooh!

28:45.835 --> 28:48.035
Annie told us

28:48.037 --> 28:49.403
how you forced her
to be your wife!

28:49.405 --> 28:50.938
I never!

28:50.940 --> 28:52.373
Calm yourself, Andrew!
What do you mean, "wife"?

28:52.375 --> 28:54.108
You can't believe
a word that whore says!

28:56.078 --> 28:58.079
If you're not
on that 7:00 ferry,

28:58.081 --> 29:00.348
I will put a slug
in your head

29:00.350 --> 29:01.749
and let Chang
the chinaman

29:01.751 --> 29:03.084
cut off your privates
for chop suey, huh?

29:03.086 --> 29:04.418
You understand?
You understand?

29:04.420 --> 29:05.620
Yeah.

29:05.622 --> 29:06.854
Get up.

29:12.261 --> 29:13.494
Get!

29:13.496 --> 29:16.330
Look at you!

29:16.332 --> 29:19.467
You're
quite the beauty

29:19.469 --> 29:22.069
and I'm quite
the jealous bitch.

29:22.071 --> 29:24.472
Now, you're
going to stay away

29:24.474 --> 29:28.175
from that pipe and do
as you're told.

29:28.177 --> 29:30.111
Did detective Corcoran

29:30.113 --> 29:32.380
really tell you
to bring me here?

29:32.382 --> 29:34.849
Yes, he did,
child,

29:34.851 --> 29:36.717
and he's very sick,
so he couldn't

29:36.719 --> 29:38.219
tell you himself,
but he promises

29:38.221 --> 29:39.720
to come visit
when he recovers.

29:39.722 --> 29:42.790
Forget about
detective Corcoran, hmm?

29:42.792 --> 29:44.292
I know a gentleman

29:44.294 --> 29:46.027
who's very anxious
to see you again.

29:46.029 --> 29:47.795
Priscilla!

29:47.797 --> 29:50.498
Yes, madame.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.266
Take this urchin
to the second floor

29:52.268 --> 29:55.403
and give her
a bath.

29:55.405 --> 29:57.571
Go with
Priscilla.

29:57.573 --> 30:00.408
Come on, cherie.

30:08.317 --> 30:11.052
$100.

30:11.054 --> 30:13.921
Pleasure doing
business with you.

30:13.923 --> 30:14.922
Sold it?

30:19.761 --> 30:22.463
Did Garland say to whom
he sold the church?

30:22.465 --> 30:25.199
No.
No, sir, but,

30:25.201 --> 30:28.736
whoever it was
paid him $90,000.

30:31.507 --> 30:33.007
I have asked you
to accomplish

30:33.009 --> 30:34.809
one thing, Haverford,
and you've failed.

30:34.811 --> 30:36.077
Get out.

30:38.146 --> 30:39.580
Mr. morehouse...

30:39.582 --> 30:41.415
must I ring
for the Butler?

30:52.994 --> 30:55.896
Having a bad
night, Winnie?

31:10.011 --> 31:13.581
I have a present
for you, father.

31:16.585 --> 31:19.253
The Mother Ame
zion church.

31:26.228 --> 31:30.398
And you only paid
$90,000, eh?

32:31.726 --> 32:34.528
Drink this. It will
help you relax.

32:34.530 --> 32:37.298
It's for
your own good.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.967
If you bite that
gentleman again,

32:39.969 --> 32:43.471
you'll get yourself
another whipping.

32:47.375 --> 32:50.578
That's right,
we do the dying,

32:50.580 --> 32:52.580
while the uptown
bigwigs do the crying,

32:52.582 --> 32:54.081
all the way
to the bank.

32:54.083 --> 32:56.283
You're right,
sergeant.

32:56.285 --> 32:57.885
Maguire! Have a beer,
on the house.

32:57.887 --> 32:59.487
Can't, sergeant.

32:59.489 --> 33:00.988
Been a death over
at the Earle house.

33:00.990 --> 33:02.490
One of the batty
old ladies

33:02.492 --> 33:03.991
who lived there
has passed on.

33:03.993 --> 33:05.326
Natural causes.

33:05.328 --> 33:07.394
Evidently, she was rich
and has no heirs.

33:07.396 --> 33:09.263
No heirs, you say?

33:09.265 --> 33:11.398
Detective Corcoran says
you should have

33:11.400 --> 33:12.733
first pickings.

33:12.735 --> 33:14.235
Come on, boys.

33:14.237 --> 33:15.736
Yeah, we're right
behind you, sergeant.

34:22.938 --> 34:24.505
Monsieur H,

34:24.507 --> 34:26.940
she is waiting for you
with breath bated.

34:26.943 --> 34:28.576
Ah, Contessa,

34:28.578 --> 34:31.145
you always fulfill
a promise.

35:23.587 --> 35:25.355
Ahh!

35:31.395 --> 35:33.263
Annie.

35:34.498 --> 35:35.798
Annie.

35:37.268 --> 35:38.468
Do it.

35:50.614 --> 35:52.148
This is
for my sister.

35:53.550 --> 35:54.717
Aah!

35:59.423 --> 36:00.590
Agh.

36:02.726 --> 36:05.295
Ah.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.702
Agh.

36:20.210 --> 36:21.711
What are you talking
about? What happened?

36:25.015 --> 36:27.617
Ohh!
Oh oh oh!

36:27.619 --> 36:28.618
Oh!

36:28.620 --> 36:29.986
Oh! Ohh!

36:40.899 --> 36:42.999
You know what
to do.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.768
Yes.

36:50.608 --> 36:54.544
Soon, this will all be
in the past.

36:57.314 --> 37:00.616
Anh.

37:00.618 --> 37:03.086
Come on.
Come on, come on.

37:06.890 --> 37:08.524
Aah!

37:08.526 --> 37:11.661
Aah!
I'm in hell.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.096
Morphine's
wearing off.

37:13.098 --> 37:14.697
Oh!

37:14.699 --> 37:16.799
Ohh!

37:16.801 --> 37:19.736
Ah! Ahh!

37:28.245 --> 37:30.213
Aaaaah!

37:30.215 --> 37:32.482
Aah! Aah!

37:32.484 --> 37:34.183
Aaaah!

37:34.185 --> 37:35.818
Aah!

37:45.730 --> 37:48.698
There's
blood here.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.932
Be careful.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.467
Right foot.
Right, look there.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.170
Watch where you
step, lass.

37:54.172 --> 37:57.006
Would you step outside
for us, please, ma'am.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.574
Right, yeah,
come on in.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.910
Body here.
Check on her.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.082
What's this?

38:06.084 --> 38:07.817
Straight opium
and Brandy.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.318
Back when you
were boxing,

38:09.320 --> 38:10.820
you ever get
knocked out?

38:10.822 --> 38:11.921
Yeah, sure.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.357
Well, this'll feel
about the same.

38:24.568 --> 38:29.238
<i>Daddy.</i>

38:29.240 --> 38:32.909
<i>Daddy!</i>

38:32.911 --> 38:35.211
Maggie.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.683
<i>Daddy.</i>

38:52.796 --> 38:54.297
Sergeant's
here, boys.

39:01.738 --> 39:05.475
Morning,
sergeant.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.710
Corky,
Corky, Corky.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.379
Sorry about your
misfortunes, and all,

39:10.381 --> 39:12.081
but cap'n Sullivan
wanted me

39:12.083 --> 39:16.619
to have a doctor
check out your leg.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.554
The captain
is concerned

39:18.556 --> 39:20.056
that some
of his own men

39:20.058 --> 39:21.557
may have had something
to do with the deaths

39:21.559 --> 39:25.461
of Winfred Haverford
and Contessa Pompadou.

39:26.631 --> 39:29.532
Aaaagh!

39:29.534 --> 39:31.734
The leg is definitely
fractured.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.605
You're a smart
one, Corky.

39:37.307 --> 39:39.809
You really do remind me
of my dead brother.

39:51.855 --> 39:54.090
♪ One, two, three,
four, five ♪

39:54.092 --> 39:57.093
♪ hunt the hare and turn
her down the rocky road ♪

39:57.095 --> 40:00.429
♪ all the way to dublin,

40:16.280 --> 40:17.780
The news
about Winfred Haverford

40:17.782 --> 40:20.416
is absolutely
stunning.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.618
He was killed, rescuing
that unfortunate child,

40:22.620 --> 40:24.453
Annie, from the claws
of Contessa Pompadou.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.955
I never
thought of Winnie

40:25.957 --> 40:27.857
as the heroic type.

40:27.859 --> 40:31.294
Proving that every man
is capable of change.

40:35.699 --> 40:37.867
My, my.

40:39.836 --> 40:43.773
We're all in need
of a calming drink.

40:51.448 --> 40:54.717
And Elizabeth Haverford,
now a widow,

40:54.719 --> 40:57.186
is going to adopt
sweet Annie.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.388
Elizabeth believes
that duty calls,

40:59.390 --> 41:02.024
that she should
continue

41:02.026 --> 41:03.526
her late husband's
philanthropic work

41:03.528 --> 41:06.028
and give Annie a place
in proper society.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.530
The widow may find it
in her heart

41:07.532 --> 41:09.865
to give <i>me</i> a proper
place in society.

41:13.071 --> 41:16.405
Mmm.

41:16.407 --> 41:19.108
Very good
whiskey, sir.

41:21.912 --> 41:23.412
Wards off the cold.

41:23.414 --> 41:27.717
I need a word alone
with Kevin.

41:37.327 --> 41:39.028
I hear you've been
gallivanting

41:39.030 --> 41:41.264
around the town
with Dr. Freeman.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.932
An amazing surgeon.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.433
It's too bad
he's a negro.

41:44.435 --> 41:46.469
Father hates
the fact that

41:46.471 --> 41:48.037
a negro cut off
his son's leg.

41:48.039 --> 41:50.172
Father's worried
that his friends

41:50.174 --> 41:52.408
at the union league club
will discover the truth.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.677
I, on the contrary,

41:54.679 --> 41:57.346
will in perpetuity be
grateful to Freeman.

42:01.019 --> 42:04.854
Father says he's quite
impressed with you.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.622
He thinks you can be
quite useful.

42:06.624 --> 42:10.726
Father uses "quite"
quite a lot.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.662
But I warn you,
though...

42:12.664 --> 42:14.630
father also thinks
that you may be

42:14.632 --> 42:16.132
too smart
for your own good.

42:22.706 --> 42:27.877
The war will be
over soon

42:27.879 --> 42:30.212
and the world will be
full of bright promises

42:30.214 --> 42:32.948
and the city
of New York

42:32.950 --> 42:37.153
will lead the way
in promises,

42:37.155 --> 42:39.455
as well as dangers,

42:39.457 --> 42:40.956
dangers
far worse than

42:40.958 --> 42:42.858
what we experienced
in Gettysburg.

42:44.961 --> 42:46.429
You,

42:46.431 --> 42:49.965
me, and our good friend
Matthew Freeman,

42:49.967 --> 42:52.468
we three must tread
carefully.

42:54.338 --> 42:57.740
Our lives depend
on our finesse.

43:04.948 --> 43:07.650
Tread carefully,
Corky.

43:38.715 --> 43:40.249
What do you think?
I'm no critic.

43:40.251 --> 43:41.517
You're no
gentleman, either.

43:41.519 --> 43:43.619
We burned down your last
orphanage, Garland.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.321
We'll burn this one
down, too.

43:45.323 --> 43:46.989
Sweet mother Malone.

43:46.991 --> 43:49.091
Reverend, you seem awfully
calm for a guilty man.

43:49.093 --> 43:50.826
A good way to start
another riot is

43:50.828 --> 43:52.661
to blame a negro man
for the crime.

43:52.663 --> 43:54.230
I say lynch him!

43:54.232 --> 43:56.365
I can't sleep.
I keep hearing voices.

43:56.367 --> 43:57.566
Men's voices.

43:57.568 --> 43:59.235
This transaction
remains between us.

43:59.237 --> 44:00.436
You will tell
no one.

44:00.438 --> 44:02.571
If you should happen
to come across

44:02.573 --> 44:04.073
a distinctive
gold locket...

44:04.075 --> 44:06.242
I find the locket,
I'll find Ellen.
