00:38.374 --> 00:40.957
Bear witness, Zeus...

00:41.085 --> 00:44.044
...and all you gods of high Olympus!

00:44.587 --> 00:46.921
I condemn my daughter, Danae...

00:47.590 --> 00:50.592
...and her son, Perseus, to the sea!

00:51.302 --> 00:52.927
Her guilt and sin...

00:53.763 --> 00:56.222
...have brought shame to Argos.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.892
I, Acrisius, the king...

00:59.310 --> 01:03.271
...now purge her crime
and restore my honor!

01:04.065 --> 01:07.734
Their blood is not on my hands!

01:11.614 --> 01:14.824
- Now!
- Ah!

05:04.013 --> 05:05.513
It is done.

05:05.681 --> 05:10.018
As we feared, King Acrisius of Argos has
abandoned his daughter and her child...

05:10.227 --> 05:11.686
...to the sea.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.689
Then he will be punished.

05:15.024 --> 05:18.901
Cruel and ruthless crime! Blasphemy!

05:19.570 --> 05:24.866
How dare the tyrant pray to me
to forgive his savage jealousy...

05:25.034 --> 05:26.576
...and cowardly revenge!

05:26.869 --> 05:31.164
Acrisius has always shown devotion
to the gods of Olympus!

05:31.373 --> 05:35.376
He has built many temples
and dedicated them to you...

05:35.586 --> 05:38.338
...great Zeus, father of the gods.

05:38.547 --> 05:42.258
A hundred good deeds cannot atone
for one murder.

05:43.177 --> 05:49.307
A thousand temples or statues or
sanctuaries, whether dedicated to me...

05:49.516 --> 05:52.101
...or to you, Hera, my wife...

05:52.728 --> 05:56.564
...or to Thetis, lovely goddess
of the sea.

05:56.732 --> 06:02.320
Or to you, Athena,
ever wise and full of care.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.573
Or to Aphrodite, goddess of love.

06:06.450 --> 06:10.328
Nothing can wipe out or forgive...

06:10.537 --> 06:13.289
...this one contemptible act of blood!

06:13.582 --> 06:15.249
Does it matter?

06:15.417 --> 06:17.960
The death of a girl and her child?

06:18.128 --> 06:21.297
Girl? His daughter!

06:21.840 --> 06:27.303
- After a lifetime's respect and devotion...
- Enough! I've decided.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.099
Acrisius must be punished...

06:31.308 --> 06:33.935
...and his people with him.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.104
My lord, Poseidon...

06:36.271 --> 06:39.982
...I command you to raise
the wind and the sea.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.485
Destroy Argos!

06:42.653 --> 06:46.864
And to make certain no stone stands,
that no creature crawls...

06:47.074 --> 06:50.827
...I command you to let loose
the last of the Titans.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.496
Let loose the Kraken!

06:53.747 --> 06:56.791
The kingdom of Acrisius
must be destroyed!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.252
As you command.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.171
Yet, be certain...

07:02.423 --> 07:06.175
...no harm befalls
young Danae or her son.

07:06.385 --> 07:12.098
Bring them safe to some remote
and peaceful shore. Go now, swiftly.

07:18.272 --> 07:22.191
No pity, no mercy. Why?

07:22.443 --> 07:25.486
Zeus, your husband, loved the girl.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.614
- Danae?
- She is very beautiful.

07:28.782 --> 07:33.327
So beautiful that Acrisius grew
jealous and guarded her from men...

07:33.495 --> 07:35.329
...locked behind iron doors.

07:35.497 --> 07:39.375
But Zeus transformed himself
into a shower of gold and visited her...

07:39.668 --> 07:41.544
...visited her and loved her.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.629
Then why should I show compassion?

07:43.839 --> 07:48.801
- Let her drown! With her child!
- The child, Perseus, is Zeus' son.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.346
That is why he is to be saved...

07:53.140 --> 07:57.393
...and why Argos is doomed.

11:29.898 --> 11:35.403
Danae and her child have been brought
safely to the island of Seriphos.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.863
Seriphos.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.577
There let Danae and her child live,
safe...

11:43.745 --> 11:45.746
...and happy.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.952
Perseus, grown to a young man.

13:07.662 --> 13:12.333
He's had a happy childhood. With
a strong body and a handsome face...

13:12.542 --> 13:15.669
...what more could any mortal
desire or deserve?

13:15.962 --> 13:18.839
And what of my son Calibos?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.175
His crimes are unforgivable.

13:21.843 --> 13:27.181
- Be merciful to him. Show pity.
- Impossible!

13:27.474 --> 13:29.225
Calibos...

13:29.392 --> 13:31.852
...had every advantage!

13:32.062 --> 13:36.023
You, as patron goddess
of the city of Joppa, have spoiled...

13:36.233 --> 13:37.566
...and indulged him since birth.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.446
You gave him the Wells of the Moon to rule,
and what has he done?

13:42.614 --> 13:45.032
Hunted and destroyed
every living creature!

13:45.534 --> 13:49.870
He's trapped and killed
my sacred herd of flying horses...

13:50.080 --> 13:54.792
...and now only the stallion,
Pegasus, remains.

13:55.210 --> 14:00.548
- Your son must therefore be punished.
- No, I beg you. Be merciful.

14:02.592 --> 14:06.053
He will become abhorrent
to human sight.

14:07.430 --> 14:12.810
He'll be shunned and forced to live as an
outcast in the swamps and marshes.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.730
He'll be transformed
to a mortal mockery.

14:16.898 --> 14:21.902
The shameful mark of his vile cruelty.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.334
This is my final judgement.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.295
No, I implore you.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.298
He is to marry Princess Andromeda.

14:42.966 --> 14:46.260
He would rule all Joppa and Phoenicia.

14:46.428 --> 14:49.471
Let the princess look upon him now!

14:52.809 --> 14:56.770
Be comforted. He may change his mind.

14:57.063 --> 15:01.775
Had it been his own child Perseus,
he would have forgiven him.

15:01.985 --> 15:06.822
But for my son Calibos,
there is to be no mercy, no hope.

15:06.990 --> 15:12.620
- And no marriage with Andromeda.
- How can there be now?

15:15.790 --> 15:18.626
Yet if my son...

15:18.793 --> 15:21.503
...is not to marry her...

15:25.008 --> 15:27.885
...then no man will.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.805
My priests of Joppa are loyal.

15:32.307 --> 15:37.478
I will speak to them
in dreams and omens.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.981
As my Calibos suffers...

15:41.483 --> 15:44.151
...so will Andromeda.

15:45.820 --> 15:46.904
I promise you.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.658
The son of Zeus...

15:50.825 --> 15:54.536
...is to be left
to the whim of chance...

15:54.704 --> 15:58.874
...while mine is punished
with deformity.

15:59.209 --> 16:04.171
It is time for chance to intervene.

16:04.714 --> 16:08.008
Time you saw something
of the world, Perseus.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.512
Time you came face to face with fear.

16:11.721 --> 16:16.517
Time to know the terrors of the dark
and look on death.

16:16.935 --> 16:21.522
Time your eyes were opened
to grim reality.

16:21.731 --> 16:25.317
Far to the east, across the sea...

16:25.527 --> 16:27.528
...in Joppa...

16:27.696 --> 16:31.323
...in the kingdom of Phoenicia.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.400
Who are you?

17:11.489 --> 17:13.240
Who are you?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.575
Show yourself!

17:20.290 --> 17:22.415
Who are you?

17:25.753 --> 17:28.922
- First tell me where I am!
- "Where"?

17:30.008 --> 17:31.425
Where am I?

17:31.634 --> 17:34.887
What, you don't know where you are?

17:35.096 --> 17:36.138
I don't know.

17:36.389 --> 17:40.309
Now let's be patient for a moment.
My name is Ammon.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.270
I am a poet and a playwright.
And you?

17:43.438 --> 17:45.481
My name is Perseus.

17:45.648 --> 17:49.276
- I am heir to the kingdom of Argos.
- By the gods!

17:49.444 --> 17:50.986
How did you get here?

17:51.613 --> 17:53.989
I'm not sure I know where "here" is.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.785
Well, this is the amphitheater
of Joppa.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.788
- Where?
- The great city of Joppa.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.917
But how?

18:06.628 --> 18:10.297
I was lying on the seashore,
looking up at the moon.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.299
Oh, the moon!

18:12.634 --> 18:15.844
That might explain things.
You see, the moon...

18:16.054 --> 18:17.679
...affects the brain.

18:17.931 --> 18:23.268
I think we'd be safer inside,
out of the night air.

18:24.521 --> 18:29.691
I must apologize for this dramatic
finery and the theatrical effects.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.861
I put them on to frighten away
the curious.

18:33.071 --> 18:36.156
It makes them think
the amphitheater is haunted.

18:36.324 --> 18:40.202
- Why is everything so neglected?
- It's a sign of the times.

18:40.370 --> 18:44.331
This kingdom is under a curse,
and the city is in despair.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.708
Everyone goes around muttering:

18:46.876 --> 18:51.797
"Call no man happy who is not dead!"

18:53.174 --> 18:55.217
Now then, my young friend.

18:55.385 --> 19:00.180
You say your name is Perseus,
heir to the kingdom of Argos?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.558
Yes.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.562
But up to now I've lived
all my life in Seriphos.

19:07.105 --> 19:10.816
Someday I will return
to reclaim Argos.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.195
- After I was born, my mother and I...
- I know!

19:15.905 --> 19:18.073
- You do?
- Certainly.

19:18.241 --> 19:22.035
The beautiful princess
and the jealous tyrant...

19:22.203 --> 19:25.372
...you and your mother
thrown into the sea...

19:25.582 --> 19:27.708
...and the destruction of Argos.

19:27.876 --> 19:31.628
It's been a popular story here
for the past 20 years.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.131
I, myself, wrote a poem about it.

19:34.340 --> 19:38.385
- Rather moving, as I recall.
- Then...

19:38.928 --> 19:42.723
...can you explain
what happened to me tonight?

19:42.932 --> 19:47.436
The gods of Olympus are mysterious,
and their motives are erratic.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.146
My advice to you:

19:49.355 --> 19:54.276
Return to the calm of Seriphos
as quickly as you can.

19:55.028 --> 19:59.406
But my mother's last wish was
that I would restore her homeland.

20:02.619 --> 20:07.456
Joppa would be a better starting place
than some remote little island.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.249
Well, in that case...

20:09.459 --> 20:13.212
...you ought to get something
more becoming to wear.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.756
I mean, something more fitting...

20:15.924 --> 20:20.761
...something more appropriate
for a prince, so to speak. Get out!

20:20.970 --> 20:23.222
And look at this!

20:25.892 --> 20:28.727
Ah, that looks well.

20:28.937 --> 20:33.148
That will do very well.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.984
Your sword.

20:36.778 --> 20:41.657
Welcome to Joppa, Prince Perseus.

20:46.287 --> 20:51.792
You set him down half-naked
in a strange, despairing city?

20:52.001 --> 20:55.504
- Chance?
- Nothing to do with chance and you know it!

20:55.755 --> 21:00.634
A deliberate and malicious act
unworthy of a goddess!

21:00.802 --> 21:05.514
- You accuse me?
- Well, one thing is certain.

21:05.723 --> 21:09.810
My son needs more than an actor's
cloak and a wooden sword!

21:09.978 --> 21:14.982
Provide him with suitable weapons.
Weapons of divine temper.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.483
A helmet!

21:16.985 --> 21:18.151
A sword!

21:19.320 --> 21:20.946
A shield!

21:21.155 --> 21:24.157
And he must have them with all speed!

21:27.537 --> 21:30.539
- All for love of Danae.
- No!

21:30.707 --> 21:34.543
So many women have attracted him,
he couldn't remember her.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.713
It's his foolish pride
in a handsome son.

21:37.880 --> 21:43.010
As you say, so many women. And all
these transformations he invents...

21:43.177 --> 21:46.555
...to seduce them.
Sometimes a shower of gold...

21:46.806 --> 21:51.518
...a bull or a swan. He tried
to ravish me disguised as a cuttlefish.

21:51.686 --> 21:55.230
- Did he succeed?
- Certainly not.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.650
- What did you do?
- Beat him at his own game.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.153
I turned myself into a shark.

22:56.834 --> 23:01.963
Mm. Why, you're up with the sun.
Beautiful morning!

23:02.131 --> 23:04.091
Magical!

23:04.258 --> 23:06.426
I found this here by the statue.

23:06.636 --> 23:11.139
That is the likeness of the goddess
of love. It's remarkable.

23:11.349 --> 23:14.309
- A sword, eh?
- Yes.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.771
- This is no ordinary sword.
- It's a strange metal.

23:17.980 --> 23:22.943
It's neither brass nor iron.
It's like no metal I have ever seen.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.783
By the gods!

23:30.451 --> 23:31.660
There's a shield!

23:32.412 --> 23:34.621
And over there's a helmet!

23:34.831 --> 23:37.374
I was right to say, "By the gods!"

23:37.583 --> 23:39.668
Who else could make a sword...

23:39.877 --> 23:42.796
...that slices through solid marble...

23:42.964 --> 23:47.134
...without leaving the slightest
blemish on the blade?

23:48.511 --> 23:51.513
If the sword can do that...

23:51.681 --> 23:54.641
...what about the helmet
and the shield?

23:54.851 --> 23:58.186
We'd better...
That is, you'd better find out.

23:59.397 --> 24:03.483
- I'll try the helmet.
- No! Try me first.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.611
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

24:06.821 --> 24:11.992
The sound came from over by
that statue of Hera. From that shield!

24:21.002 --> 24:23.670
Turn me around!

24:28.718 --> 24:30.552
Oh.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.221
Perseus!

24:33.431 --> 24:36.183
Perseus, Perseus.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.312
Mark me, Perseus.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.023
These weapons are gifts from the gods.

24:43.357 --> 24:47.402
Guard well this shield...

24:47.570 --> 24:52.240
...for one day it will
guard your life.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.910
Guard my life?

24:55.578 --> 24:58.497
- When?
- You will know...

24:58.706 --> 25:01.249
...when the day comes.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.754
- What about the helmet?
- It has the power...

25:06.005 --> 25:08.590
...to render its wearer...

25:09.258 --> 25:11.426
...invisible.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.762
Invisible?

25:14.180 --> 25:16.765
Invisible.

25:18.226 --> 25:19.601
Wait!

25:19.769 --> 25:22.270
Wait. Who are you?

25:23.689 --> 25:28.401
Find and fulfill your destiny.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.114
Destiny?

25:36.994 --> 25:40.539
A divine gift should never
be questioned...

25:41.040 --> 25:43.583
...simply accepted.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.715
Invisible.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.077
Can you see me?

26:19.287 --> 26:21.413
Nothing.

26:21.622 --> 26:25.250
Nothing of you at all!
Where are you?

26:25.418 --> 26:29.337
- I'm invisible! Can't you see that?
- All I can see are your footsteps.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.800
The gods are truly remarkable.

26:35.136 --> 26:37.304
Perseus...

26:37.847 --> 26:39.472
...where are you going?

26:39.640 --> 26:40.807
To Joppa!

26:42.143 --> 26:43.977
Your sword!

26:44.145 --> 26:47.480
Oh, impetuous...

26:47.690 --> 26:49.691
...foolish...

26:49.942 --> 26:53.695
Ah, dear, the young.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.324
Why do they never listen?

26:59.201 --> 27:02.203
When will they ever learn?

28:29.875 --> 28:31.042
A stranger here?

28:31.252 --> 28:34.254
A stranger to sights like these.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.173
- Was he a criminal?
- No.

28:37.383 --> 28:40.135
He was a suitor
for the Princess Andromeda.

28:40.302 --> 28:45.098
That woman over there is her mother,
Queen Cassiopeia.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.892
A royal suitor? Burned?

28:48.310 --> 28:50.770
A suitor, yes, but not royal.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.774
- I don't understand.
- These are strange times, my friend.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.947
Andromeda was destined
to marry Prince Calibos.

29:01.115 --> 29:05.243
Then he was struck down, deformed,
punished by the gods.

29:05.453 --> 29:09.998
Andromeda refused to marry him.
The priests prayed, read the signs...

29:10.207 --> 29:13.251
...and declared that Thetis was angry.

29:13.461 --> 29:17.797
Since then, any man may present
himself as a suitor.

29:18.299 --> 29:23.428
- I wonder that any man would even try.
- Andromeda is very beautiful.

29:23.637 --> 29:27.766
Besides, whoever marries her
will rule the city and the kingdom.

29:27.975 --> 29:30.310
For such a prize,
men are willing to risk their lives.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.813
- They have only to solve a riddle.
- A riddle?

29:34.023 --> 29:37.650
- Is that all?
- The riddle changes for each suitor.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.487
And those who fail...

29:41.155 --> 29:43.865
...do not tell what they were asked.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.367
And this Calibos...

29:47.203 --> 29:50.205
- ...what of him?
- We live in fear of him.

29:50.372 --> 29:54.042
Fear of what he may do in vengeance
against Andromeda.

29:54.335 --> 29:57.003
- Where is she?
- In the highest tower...

29:57.213 --> 30:00.548
...above this smoke and stench.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.469
She will not speak or eat
in protest of this ritual.

30:04.637 --> 30:09.682
She remains alone, away from these
accursed, hell-sent swarms...

30:09.892 --> 30:12.894
...of blood-gutted marsh flies.

30:13.354 --> 30:15.522
Thank you, friend.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.086
Andromeda.

34:10.049 --> 34:13.051
I've found my destiny.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.987
Calibos.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.409
The vulture flew toward the east.

34:39.620 --> 34:44.831
Toward the swamps! Toward the lair
of the Lord of the Marsh.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.418
We must find a way to follow the bird.

34:48.629 --> 34:53.424
If and when it appears
to the princess again.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.552
Yes.

34:57.179 --> 35:02.475
But how are we going to follow
a creature that flies through the air?

35:03.602 --> 35:08.606
There just might be a chance,
you see.

35:09.483 --> 35:13.194
Remote, I grant you.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.488
Tonight!

35:29.128 --> 35:32.547
When the full moon shines
on the water, they say...

35:32.714 --> 35:36.384
...Pegasus, the last of the winged
horses, comes to drink.

35:38.095 --> 35:39.470
Listen!

35:40.889 --> 35:42.014
Look there!

35:42.516 --> 35:45.184
- I see nothing.
- Over there!

35:50.107 --> 35:52.191
Pegasus!

37:08.894 --> 37:11.729
That's it, that's it. Easy, easy.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.281
Whoa, easy.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.158
Easy!

37:37.923 --> 37:38.965
That's it.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.272
Steady, steady.

39:42.881 --> 39:46.217
That's it, that's it, that's it!

39:46.426 --> 39:48.302
Good boy, good boy.

40:00.107 --> 40:04.443
The most beautiful stallion
in the world. But thirsty.

40:04.611 --> 40:09.156
I'm not surprised.
I could do with something myself.

40:09.408 --> 40:12.618
- Here. Stay with him.
- Oh.

40:12.828 --> 40:14.412
Pegasus.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.997
You're beautiful. Now don't you fret.

40:17.165 --> 40:20.459
Your friend will be back in a moment.

40:21.336 --> 40:25.131
- Slow, slow.
- Pegasus.

40:28.927 --> 40:34.014
- We did it!
- No, you did it. You did it!

43:40.493 --> 43:43.787
A gift for you.

44:12.734 --> 44:16.195
Calibos, why have you summoned
me here again?

44:16.613 --> 44:20.491
Because if I cannot look upon
your true beauty...

44:20.992 --> 44:26.121
...I can see its mirror,
and remember how you once...

44:26.331 --> 44:27.915
...loved me.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.710
Remember me how I was.

44:32.087 --> 44:36.340
I remember, but now...

44:36.716 --> 44:41.178
Then it is time for you to learn a new
mystery, a new question!

44:41.429 --> 44:46.392
No, I beg you. No more bonfires.

44:56.111 --> 45:00.781
Mark well, Andromeda.
A new question...

45:00.949 --> 45:04.743
...for a would-be hero.

45:11.418 --> 45:15.421
Mark, and remember.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.729
When the time comes...

45:31.938 --> 45:35.899
...when the next suitor
presents himself...

45:36.109 --> 45:39.570
...you will remember.

45:40.780 --> 45:44.408
Calibos, I implore you...

45:44.617 --> 45:48.120
...lift your curse from Joppa
and release my soul.

45:48.747 --> 45:50.748
Show pity, Calibos.

45:51.750 --> 45:54.418
As you loved me once...

45:55.420 --> 45:58.338
...be merciful now.

46:12.812 --> 46:14.730
Go.

47:11.579 --> 47:19.579
Pegasus!

48:46.633 --> 48:51.470
Once again I, Cassiopeia, the queen...

48:51.804 --> 48:54.973
...present to you my daughter,
Andromeda.

48:55.683 --> 49:01.146
If there is any man here worthy
to seek her hand in marriage...

49:01.314 --> 49:04.983
...let him make himself known!

49:07.487 --> 49:09.696
Is there no one?

49:09.948 --> 49:14.701
No man worthy in my whole
wide kingdom of Phoenicia?

49:14.911 --> 49:18.830
No man of courage in the whole world?

49:38.726 --> 49:40.185
Who are you?

49:40.353 --> 49:45.357
Perseus, prince and heir
to the kingdom of Argos.

49:54.575 --> 49:56.326
You!

49:57.203 --> 49:58.870
You know him?

50:00.873 --> 50:02.457
Only...

50:03.334 --> 50:05.919
...from a dream.

50:06.546 --> 50:10.048
I beg you, abandon me.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.718
Ask your riddle.

50:18.099 --> 50:20.392
In my mind's eyes I see...

50:20.601 --> 50:25.731
...three circles joined in priceless,
graceful harmony.

50:25.858 --> 50:30.110
Two full as the moon.
One hollow as a crown.

50:30.571 --> 50:34.072
Two from the sea, five fathoms down.

50:34.701 --> 50:38.243
One from the earth,
deep under the ground.

50:38.413 --> 50:42.039
The whole, a mark of high renown.

50:42.208 --> 50:46.543
Tell me, what can it be?

50:48.880 --> 50:51.757
Have courage, princess.

50:51.966 --> 50:53.800
What can it be?

50:54.052 --> 50:56.136
Three circles joined.

50:56.429 --> 50:59.222
Two moons and a crown.

50:59.932 --> 51:03.810
- Tell me!
- The answer is a ring!

51:04.312 --> 51:06.772
Two pearls in a circle of gold!

51:07.273 --> 51:11.943
The ring of the Lord of the Marsh.
The pearl ring of Calibos.

51:12.153 --> 51:17.324
Here, on the claw hand
of Calibos himself!

51:17.575 --> 51:21.453
The ring. A gift from his mother...

51:21.621 --> 51:23.663
...the goddess Thetis.

51:23.831 --> 51:26.166
Is that the answer?

51:26.626 --> 51:30.337
Is that the answer? Tell me!

51:30.588 --> 51:32.506
Yes.

51:35.176 --> 51:40.263
We fought in the swamp!
I spared his life on one condition.

51:41.599 --> 51:44.351
That he renounce his curse.

51:45.144 --> 51:47.521
There will be no more bonfires.

51:47.855 --> 51:50.524
No more nightmares.

51:51.067 --> 51:54.319
Light has conquered darkness.

51:54.654 --> 51:56.822
You're free.

52:31.816 --> 52:36.111
Thetis, divine goddess of the sea.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.239
Hear the prayer of your son Calibos.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.159
Show me the way to justice.

52:43.244 --> 52:47.831
Show me how to punish Perseus
for this blasphemy!

52:50.209 --> 52:52.544
Look on this!

52:52.712 --> 52:54.254
In wounding me...

52:54.422 --> 52:57.215
...he has insulted you!

52:57.425 --> 53:01.678
Then surely he must be punished.

53:02.138 --> 53:04.139
Show me.

53:04.557 --> 53:06.892
Help me.

53:10.563 --> 53:14.232
Perseus is protected by Zeus himself.

53:14.609 --> 53:16.234
There is nothing I can do.

53:16.736 --> 53:19.404
Then punish those that Perseus loves!

53:20.364 --> 53:22.908
The queen, Andromeda...

53:23.075 --> 53:25.285
...the people of Joppa!

53:25.745 --> 53:29.039
Persuade your devoted Lord Poseidon...

53:29.415 --> 53:31.958
...to let loose the Kraken
on the city.

53:32.210 --> 53:34.794
Let the Kraken destroy Joppa...

53:35.213 --> 53:38.965
...as it destroyed Argos!

53:39.217 --> 53:41.760
I demand justice!

53:42.261 --> 53:46.473
Justice, or revenge?

53:58.486 --> 54:02.280
- Did you love Calibos?
- Before he was punished?

54:03.241 --> 54:06.201
No, it was never love.

54:06.410 --> 54:10.497
He was handsome and fascinating.
I was very young.

54:10.748 --> 54:15.835
- And now?
- Now I feel pity for him.

54:16.712 --> 54:20.674
When you fought in the swamp,
why didn't you kill him?

54:23.302 --> 54:27.180
Perhaps because I too felt pity.

54:27.348 --> 54:29.599
I still don't understand.

54:29.809 --> 54:34.604
We met today and yet you say
you've loved me for much longer.

54:35.523 --> 54:40.652
I did see you once. I saw you asleep.

54:40.987 --> 54:44.155
- From that moment I was hopelessly lost.
- Asleep?

54:44.490 --> 54:47.367
Just believe me when I say...

54:47.618 --> 54:50.370
...that I did see you.

54:50.538 --> 54:54.833
And the sight of you passed
straight through me like an arrow.

54:55.543 --> 54:58.545
It astonished me.

54:58.796 --> 55:03.008
From that moment, I knew
that I would do anything for you.

55:03.467 --> 55:06.177
From that moment...

55:06.345 --> 55:08.972
...I knew that I loved you.

55:26.032 --> 55:29.784
As I bind their hands
with this silken thread...

55:30.369 --> 55:34.039
...bear witness that as she
is my heiress...

55:34.582 --> 55:38.043
...so Perseus becomes my heir.

55:38.210 --> 55:40.045
As she is my daughter...

55:40.212 --> 55:45.091
...so Perseus becomes my son.

55:49.263 --> 55:54.726
I give her to the man
who has saved us from despair.

55:55.061 --> 55:57.395
I give Andromeda...

55:57.605 --> 56:00.857
...the most beautiful of all prizes...

56:01.067 --> 56:04.444
...more beautiful
than anything on earth...

56:04.695 --> 56:07.906
...or in heaven. Even more lovely...

56:08.115 --> 56:10.450
...than the goddess Thetis herself.

56:41.649 --> 56:44.442
Hear me, vain and foolish
mortal woman.

56:44.777 --> 56:49.406
You dare compare your daughter's
beauty to mine in my own sanctuary?

56:49.824 --> 56:53.159
You will repent your boast
and the cruel injury...

56:53.369 --> 56:56.329
...you have inflicted
on my son Calibos.

56:56.497 --> 57:00.250
Forgive! Forgive...

57:00.501 --> 57:04.504
In 30 days, on the eve
of the longest day of the year...

57:04.755 --> 57:09.467
...Andromeda must be taken to
the Sacrificial Rock by the sea...

57:09.635 --> 57:12.679
...there bound and chained
to the stone...

57:12.930 --> 57:16.641
...she must be unknown to man,
a virgin.

57:17.309 --> 57:20.145
A sacrifice suitable for the Kraken.

57:20.479 --> 57:23.606
She must be delivered to the Kraken
at sunset...

57:23.816 --> 57:28.278
...or else the Kraken will destroy
Joppa and everyone within the city.

57:28.487 --> 57:32.449
For the insult to me
and the injury inflicted on my son...

57:32.658 --> 57:36.202
...I demand the life of Andromeda.

57:36.662 --> 57:39.706
In 30 days.

58:07.193 --> 58:09.861
There must be a way
to kill the Kraken.

58:10.029 --> 58:11.863
No.

58:12.031 --> 58:14.741
No way known to man.

58:14.950 --> 58:18.036
- You claim to be an optimist.
- Yes, I am.

58:18.204 --> 58:21.414
I believe that man can
overcome most obstacles.

58:21.582 --> 58:25.460
I've had enough of your philosophy.
It's time for action, not words!

58:25.669 --> 58:28.213
Now wait one moment.

58:28.380 --> 58:31.549
I said there was no way known to man.

58:31.759 --> 58:36.095
There might be a way known to woman.

58:38.724 --> 58:40.767
To woman?

58:41.018 --> 58:42.769
Three women.

58:42.978 --> 58:45.396
Three old, blind women...

58:46.106 --> 58:49.108
...gifted beyond all others
in prophecy and knowledge.

58:49.360 --> 58:53.696
They are wise, these old women!
Wise as they are ancient.

58:53.906 --> 58:56.574
- Who are they?
- The Stygian Witches.

58:56.784 --> 59:00.912
They live far away, beyond the desert
frontiers of Joppa...

59:01.121 --> 59:05.250
- ...in the mountains of the North.
- Even if you find them...

59:05.626 --> 59:09.587
...even if they show you a way
to defeat the Kraken...

59:09.755 --> 59:12.924
...you may not live
to exploit their advice.

59:13.217 --> 59:17.387
- Why not?
- They have a craving for human flesh.

59:17.805 --> 59:21.099
When the plague of Calibos
infested the city...

59:21.267 --> 59:26.771
...the queen sent ambassadors to visit
the blind witches. None ever returned.

59:26.981 --> 59:29.816
Their shrine lies
many days' journey from here.

59:30.484 --> 59:33.778
We have only 30 days left to us.

59:33.988 --> 59:36.155
But we have...

59:37.032 --> 59:39.325
We have a flying horse.

59:39.535 --> 59:41.953
Three days will take three hours.

59:42.162 --> 59:47.000
Take me with you! If only to the Wells
of the Moon. Just to be with you.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:32.397
- We've searched the lakeshore.
- No sign?

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:36.859
A few hoofprints by the water's edge,
but no tracks to follow.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:41.948
We cannot wait for Pegasus. I'll search
for the Stygian Witches on my own.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:46.160
No. We will ride with you
as far as their shrine.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.162
It is a perilous journey.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:53.084
- Too perilous for a princess.
- You are not yet my lord and husband.

01:01:54.086 --> 01:01:57.130
In the queen's absence,
it is I who command.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.090
- Herald?
- Your Highness.

01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:04.387
Return to the city. Inform the queen we are
riding as escort to Prince Perseus.

01:02:08.434 --> 01:02:10.601
We follow the North Star.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.123
Perseus is moving into danger.

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:37.128
He will find the Kraken somewhat
more formidable than Calibos.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:41.507
- Your helmet is gone?
- Deep in a swamp.

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:44.844
- Lost forever.
- Replace it with some other gift.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:50.308
- But what?
- Your friend. Bubo, the owl.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:55.146
Give Perseus your owl.
It is all-knowing, all-seeing.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:59.984
Give it to him. It is my wish.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:07.116
- My command.
- Never!

01:03:15.334 --> 01:03:17.335
Hephaestus will do what he can.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:21.214
Brass and iron
are no substitute for feathers...

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:24.967
...but he's very skilled
and ingenious.

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:30.473
Let great Zeus rage
till even Olympus shakes.

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:37.355
But I will never part with you,
my beloved Bubo. Bubo.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.693
Nothing. Nothing.

01:04:25.863 --> 01:04:29.365
- We could be lost for days in this.
- Look!

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.126
It's heading this way!

01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:44.338
It's flying straight for us.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:52.054
Is it a hawk? Is it going to attack?

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:58.603
By the gods! An owl!

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:01.147
A golden owl!

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:28.674
Too heavy for the dead branch, eh?

01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:31.177
How do you know that?

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:34.805
- He told me.
- Told you?

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:43.856
- His name is Bubo.
- Do you understand all those noises?

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.983
Perfectly clear to me.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:51.530
It's another gift from the gods.
Like the sword and the helmet.

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.326
He can lead us to the shrine.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.897
Come on!

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:38.215
Don't worry, my little friend.
Thallo will take you.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.895
Someone coming.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:56.233
Sounds like a man. A young man.

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:57.860
- Who has the eye?
- I do!

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:02.114
- Then give it to me.
- No! I want to be the first to see him.

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:05.284
What do you see, sister?
What do you see?

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:10.372
Yes! A young man, not plump
but well-made.

01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:14.293
Have no fear. I come in peace.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:21.467
Come a little closer so that we
can get a better look at you.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:26.472
- We are honored by your visit.
- What can we do to help you?

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.140
Uh...

01:10:28.475 --> 01:10:31.936
- I need your advice.
- Then you must come a little closer.

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:35.648
You see, my two sisters here
are somewhat deaf.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:39.652
- I still can't hear him.
- Suppose we were to move...

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.196
...a little closer to him.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.175
Now!

01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:07.680
- Noise, what's that noise?
- What, what? Where is it?

01:11:08.223 --> 01:11:12.101
Bubo! The eye! Go for the eye!

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.311
Where is it? What is it?

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:19.692
- What's wrong?
- It's gone! The eye!

01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:24.530
- Don't drop the eye!
- Oh, no! Where's the eye?

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:28.158
- You have it!
- Never fear. It is safe.

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:30.619
Give it to us. Give it back.

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:32.663
- On one condition.
- Anything!

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:35.457
- We must have it now!
- You will have it.

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:38.502
- After you have answered my question.
- Ask, then.

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:46.176
How may a mortal man
face and defeat the Kraken?

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:50.389
The Kraken is invulnerable.
100 men could not fight him.

01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:52.558
An army could not kill him.

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:56.979
Nothing is invulnerable.
There must be a way.

01:11:57.188 --> 01:12:01.233
Perhaps, one way.

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:05.404
But a way even more dangerous
than the Kraken itself.

01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:09.366
- Tell me.
- Give me the eye and I'll tell you.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.994
First, tell me.

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:15.039
The head of Medusa. The Gorgon!

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:20.753
One look from the head of Medusa
can turn all creatures into stone.

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:26.342
- No matter how huge and powerful.
- And her blood is a deadly venom.

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:29.178
A Titan against a Titan!

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:33.599
- You must win Medusa's head.
- She's not going to give it to you.

01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:36.435
- As a present.
- As difficult and dangerous...

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.438
...as to vanquish 1000 Krakens.

01:12:39.606 --> 01:12:41.523
Your only chance against the Kraken.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:45.110
Give us the eye.
We have answered your question.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.947
One more question.
If the eyes of Medusa...

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:53.452
...even after her death can turn
all living creatures into stone...

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:58.374
- ...what about the blood?
- Deadly and poisonous.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:03.712
But you have touched the eye.
As it has the power to give sight...

01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:09.635
...so it can make your red cloak
proof against the blood.

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:15.891
The eye is all powerful. We can
tell you no more. Give us the eye.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.477
- You have told me the truth?
- We swear it.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:24.483
- The rest is for you. Seek Medusa.
- On the Isle of the Dead.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:30.114
- At the very edge of the underworld.
- Give us back the eye!

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:31.990
Give us the eye! We must have it!

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:35.327
Here, catch.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.162
Oh!

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:41.333
- Where is it? I want it!
- It's my turn!

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:44.336
Where'd it go? Give it to me!

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:46.672
One of you has it! Give it to me!

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.843
The sands of time
run like quicksilver.

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:56.515
We'll be across these mountains
tomorrow, near the Isle of the Dead.

01:13:57.684 --> 01:13:59.476
And then, Medusa.

01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:03.480
I wrote a play about her long ago.

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:07.526
I was partial to tragedy in my youth.

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:12.656
Before experience taught me
that life is quite tragic enough...

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:16.201
- ...without my writing about it.
- Medusa.

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:22.541
- She was priestess to Aphrodite.
- Yes, and a most beautiful woman...

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:24.710
...by all accounts.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:32.384
She was seduced by Poseidon. They
made love in the temple of Aphrodite.

01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:38.056
And that goddess was so jealous
that she punished Medusa.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:44.188
She transformed her into
an apparition so horrible...

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:49.568
...that one look from her
will turn any living creature...

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:51.487
...into stone.

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.920
I'm so afraid for you.

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:11.089
It must be done.
We've no other choice.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:15.511
- Tomorrow you return to the city.
- No, I'm coming with you.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.431
Then sleep now. We ride at dawn.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:26.271
So little time together.
So little time.

01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:27.606
Shh.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:33.612
Sleep now. Sleep.

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:03.827
The river Styx.

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:06.288
The River of Death...

01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:08.332
...has strange powers.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:10.876
So I've heard.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:16.214
Time to see if the legend is true.

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:20.010
Here. You'll need this.

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:24.723
For Charon. The ferryman.

01:21:04.569 --> 01:21:09.406
Remember, one look from her
is enough.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:14.452
If you must see her, use the inside
of your shield as a mirror.

01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:17.956
Her reflection cannot harm you.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:21.293
Never look her in the face.

01:24:51.796 --> 01:24:54.506
Remember, now it's three against one.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:27.028
Guard well this shield...

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:32.116
...for one day it will
guard your life.

01:32:59.116 --> 01:33:03.661
Find and fulfill your destiny.

01:36:03.759 --> 01:36:09.805
Ah!

01:36:28.742 --> 01:36:30.367
Perseus!

01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:06.130
Thallo!

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.880
Huh?

01:39:38.139 --> 01:39:40.683
Hello, my wet friend.

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:42.685
No.

01:39:43.812 --> 01:39:46.063
No, our task is not complete.

01:39:49.526 --> 01:39:51.527
If you can fly...

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:00.869
Good.

01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:05.582
And if he's still alive...

01:40:05.834 --> 01:40:10.004
...you must try to find Pegasus.

01:43:21.279 --> 01:43:25.449
Great Zeus, below on Earth
it is now the eve...

01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:29.203
...of the longest day.

01:43:30.121 --> 01:43:31.788
Very well.

01:43:34.459 --> 01:43:35.959
Release the Kraken.

01:53:03.194 --> 01:53:05.862
Perseus has won.

01:53:06.113 --> 01:53:07.655
My son...

01:53:08.199 --> 01:53:09.783
...has triumphed.

01:53:10.034 --> 01:53:14.204
- A fortunate young man.
- Fortune is ally to the brave.

01:53:14.371 --> 01:53:16.623
What a dangerous precedent.

01:53:16.832 --> 01:53:19.375
What if one day there were other
heroes like him?

01:53:19.543 --> 01:53:24.506
What if courage and imagination
became everyday mortal qualities?

01:53:24.715 --> 01:53:26.841
We would no longer be needed.

01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:30.762
But for the moment, there is sufficient
cowardice, sloth...

01:53:30.971 --> 01:53:35.141
...and mendacity down there on Earth
to last forever.

01:53:35.351 --> 01:53:38.728
I forbid any revenge
against Perseus.

01:53:38.896 --> 01:53:41.731
He has done well.

01:53:42.858 --> 01:53:46.903
He will be rewarded.

01:53:56.914 --> 01:54:00.291
This will make a fine heroic poem,
you know.

01:54:00.501 --> 01:54:02.919
Or perhaps a play.

01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:09.551
Oh, don't worry.
I won't leave you out.

01:54:12.054 --> 01:54:16.057
Perseus and Andromeda
will be happy together.

01:54:16.267 --> 01:54:18.601
Have fine sons...

01:54:18.853 --> 01:54:21.521
...rule wisely...

01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:24.566
...and to perpetuate the story
of his courage...

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:27.527
...I command that from henceforth...

01:54:27.736 --> 01:54:31.281
...he will be set among the stars
and constellations.

01:54:31.448 --> 01:54:36.452
He, Perseus, the lovely Andromeda...

01:54:36.704 --> 01:54:41.791
...the noble Pegasus
and even the vain Cassiopeia.

01:54:41.959 --> 01:54:46.337
Let the stars be named
after them forever.

01:54:46.547 --> 01:54:51.759
As long as man shall walk the Earth
and search the night sky in wonder...

01:54:51.969 --> 01:54:55.805
...they will remember the courage
of Perseus...

01:54:55.973 --> 01:54:57.891
...forever.

01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:02.770
Even if we, the gods,
are abandoned or forgotten...

01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:07.108
...the stars will never fade.

01:55:07.277 --> 01:55:08.985
Never.

01:55:09.196 --> 01:55:13.072
They will burn till the end of time.
