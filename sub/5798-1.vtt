00:02.949 --> 00:04.849
Marcus Hooks
and the Real Deal, take 6.

00:04.918 --> 00:06.886
- That's three names.
- You want me to sing the main line?

00:06.953 --> 00:09.513
Oh, yeah, here we go, here we go.

00:09.589 --> 00:12.023
<i>Tonight we take a musical journey south,</i>

00:12.092 --> 00:15.061
<i>where the legendary soul band
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal</i>

00:15.128 --> 00:17.062
<i>developed their signature sound.</i>

00:17.130 --> 00:18.529
1, 2!

00:23.937 --> 00:25.598
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

00:25.672 --> 00:29.403
<i>They started out singing for pennies
on the street corners of Memphis.</i>

00:30.711 --> 00:32.110
Pull the string

00:32.179 --> 00:34.670
And I'll wink at you

00:34.748 --> 00:36.340
I'm your puppet

00:38.151 --> 00:40.449
Mm-hmm, yeah

00:40.520 --> 00:42.454
I'll do funny things

00:42.522 --> 00:44.990
If you want me to

00:45.058 --> 00:46.787
I'm your puppet

00:51.498 --> 00:52.829
I'm yours

00:52.899 --> 00:56.630
To have and to hold

00:56.703 --> 00:58.261
Darling, you've got

00:58.338 --> 01:00.169
Full control

01:00.240 --> 01:02.003
Of your puppet

01:03.009 --> 01:04.476
<i>But by 1972,</i>

01:04.544 --> 01:06.034
<i>Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal</i>

01:06.113 --> 01:09.344
<i>had become one
of the biggest R&B acts in the world.</i>

01:09.416 --> 01:12.510
Nothin' like sweet soul music

01:12.586 --> 01:14.520
To bring us together

01:14.588 --> 01:17.182
<i>They played to sellout houses
all over the world.</i>

01:17.257 --> 01:18.952
<i>They'd sold 6 million records</i>

01:19.025 --> 01:21.687
<i>and influenced a generation
of American musicians.</i>

01:21.762 --> 01:24.595
Dance to the sweet soul music

01:24.664 --> 01:25.596
Yahh

01:25.665 --> 01:28.634
<i>But that all ended on July 24, 1977,</i>

01:28.702 --> 01:30.670
<i>when Marcus Hooks
began his solo career</i>

01:30.737 --> 01:33.706
<i>with a dramatic concert
at New York's Madison Square Garden.</i>

01:33.774 --> 01:35.401
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:35.475 --> 01:38.273
<i>Marcus Hooks.</i>

01:46.753 --> 01:47.777
Marcus.

01:47.854 --> 01:48.878
Ooh-ooh-ooh

01:48.955 --> 01:51.150
Hey, boy, hi.

01:51.224 --> 01:52.657
Hey, boy, dance.

01:52.726 --> 01:53.818
Yeah.

01:53.894 --> 01:55.885
<i>But while Hooks
became a music legend,</i>

01:55.962 --> 01:58.692
<i>the journey took
a decidedly different direction</i>

01:58.765 --> 02:01.461
<i>for former band mates
Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds.</i>

02:03.136 --> 02:05.331
<i>Renowned for their
signature dance stylings</i>

02:05.405 --> 02:08.101
<i>from their one
breakout hit, "Walk in the Park,"</i>

02:08.175 --> 02:10.666
<i>the duo broke up in 1979.</i>

02:10.744 --> 02:12.234
<i>Citing creative differences</i>

02:12.312 --> 02:15.179
<i>and a desire to pursue separate projects.</i>

02:16.249 --> 02:17.341
Back off! Freeze!

02:17.417 --> 02:18.679
Get your hands up! Let me see them!

02:18.752 --> 02:20.879
Oh. Wait. Wait, wait.
It ain't... Ohh!

02:20.954 --> 02:23.752
The gun ain't real! Ow! It ain't real! Ow!

02:23.824 --> 02:25.519
I'm just broke, God it!

02:25.592 --> 02:27.116
I ain't tryin' to hurt no!

02:27.194 --> 02:28.661
Watch your damn hands!

02:28.728 --> 02:30.195
Police mother brutality!

02:30.263 --> 02:31.628
<i>While Floyd Henderson...</i>

02:33.600 --> 02:35.795
Come on down to Floyd's Car Wash,

02:35.869 --> 02:37.928
where everything is done by hand.

02:38.004 --> 02:39.767
<i>...combined his showmanship</i>

02:39.840 --> 02:42.035
<i>with an entrepreneur spirit.</i>

02:42.108 --> 02:44.235
And don't forget about
Super Soul Sundays,

02:44.311 --> 02:46.404
with a full body wash

02:46.480 --> 02:48.539
to guarantee a free rimjob.

02:51.184 --> 02:53.277
Come on. Get your rimjob.

02:53.353 --> 02:54.445
Come get your rimjob.

02:54.521 --> 02:56.785
Come and get your rimjob!

02:56.857 --> 02:59.883
<i>Whatever happened
to the forgotten duo...</i>

02:59.960 --> 03:01.359
<i>The Real Deal?</i>

03:05.098 --> 03:06.895
Baby, turn the navigation on.

03:06.967 --> 03:09.629
I hope we can find this place
sometime tonight.

03:09.703 --> 03:11.295
He gonna love it there.

03:11.371 --> 03:13.396
They got Craftmatic adjustable beds,

03:13.473 --> 03:15.498
clap-on lamps.

03:15.575 --> 03:17.406
Y'all better shut up back there,
I'm tellin' you.

03:17.477 --> 03:18.671
I'm gonna reach back there

03:18.745 --> 03:21.213
and pop one of them little boys
upside the head so bad.

03:22.749 --> 03:24.444
I think that's it, Uncle Floyd.

03:25.585 --> 03:27.280
Whoo!

03:27.354 --> 03:30.187
Now, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this bullshit.

03:30.257 --> 03:33.249
What you talking about?
It's beautiful. You don't like this?

03:33.326 --> 03:34.418
It's a death camp.

03:34.494 --> 03:36.826
Oh, how is it a death camp, Unc?

03:36.897 --> 03:39.024
We got 36 holes of golf.

03:39.099 --> 03:40.726
Three swimming pools.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.700
You know the ratio
of women to men here

03:42.769 --> 03:45.363
is 5 to 1, Unc? 5 to 1.

03:45.438 --> 03:46.735
That mean you got 'em everywhere.

03:46.806 --> 03:48.068
You can't even move.
There's women...

03:48.141 --> 03:49.608
Every time you look around,

03:49.676 --> 03:51.735
women crawling between your legs,
arms, anything.

03:51.811 --> 03:54.644
I mean, damn, Unc.
And if you're worried about the business,

03:54.714 --> 03:55.738
I got that.

03:55.815 --> 03:57.544
You taught me everything you know.

03:57.617 --> 03:59.209
Yeah.

03:59.286 --> 04:01.254
Yeah. You know something, son?

04:01.321 --> 04:02.288
You're real crafty.

04:02.355 --> 04:03.287
Appreciate that.

04:03.356 --> 04:04.846
See, first you move into my house.

04:04.925 --> 04:06.620
Then you take over my business.

04:06.693 --> 04:08.217
- Aw, man, I ain't taking...
- Oh, yeah.

04:08.295 --> 04:09.956
Then you move me
all the way out to the Valley, man,

04:10.030 --> 04:11.554
so can't nobody hear me scream. Right?

04:11.631 --> 04:13.997
Actually, that's why
we're moving you here.

04:14.067 --> 04:16.058
So the nurses can hear your ass scream.

04:16.136 --> 04:17.500
You remember you fell on that floor
for three days

04:17.571 --> 04:19.539
- and couldn't nobody hear you.
- I remember.

04:19.606 --> 04:23.940
Yeah. Now, stop being bitter, man.
Enjoy yourself, Unc.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.774
There are your golden years, player.

04:27.881 --> 04:29.473
Now, come on
in the house and say bye

04:29.549 --> 04:31.210
to Charlene and the kids.

04:32.218 --> 04:33.742
Fuck them kids.

04:33.820 --> 04:35.845
Fuck the kids?

04:35.922 --> 04:37.014
Yeah.

- Ohh! Ohh!

05:21.267 --> 05:24.361
Ohh! Oh, give it to me.
Give it to me nice and hard.

Uhh! Ohh!

Ooh. Don't stop, baby.

05:34.180 --> 05:36.341
No.

05:36.416 --> 05:37.849
No, you're not getting away.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.179
Hoo hoo! Hoo hoo!

05:39.252 --> 05:40.184
Yummy!

05:40.253 --> 05:42.118
Uhh! Uhh! Yeah.

05:45.592 --> 05:46.581
Aah!

05:58.104 --> 05:59.162
Mmm...

06:03.543 --> 06:04.703
How's the hip?

06:05.879 --> 06:06.903
Fine.

06:06.980 --> 06:08.004
Okay.

06:16.056 --> 06:18.217
Okay, Mr. Henderson.
I'm gonna need you

06:18.291 --> 06:20.885
to, uh, stands up, face the window,

06:20.960 --> 06:22.655
and bend over the table.

06:22.729 --> 06:24.526
My problem ain't back
in that area, doctor.

06:24.597 --> 06:26.792
Look, Mr. Henderson,
your sleep problem

06:26.866 --> 06:29.334
can be a symptom of a myriad
of different conditions,

06:29.402 --> 06:30.630
some of which, you know, are...

06:30.704 --> 06:32.899
well, you know, back in that area.

06:36.476 --> 06:38.444
I don't like nobody
behind me like that, Huds.

06:38.511 --> 06:40.274
I'm telling you, I just don't like
nobody playing

06:40.346 --> 06:42.007
- with my penny.
- I'll be very gentle.

06:42.082 --> 06:43.572
I'll be in and out before you know it.

06:46.586 --> 06:48.679
Just bend over. There you go.

06:48.755 --> 06:51.383
Hold on, now. Get a good grip.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.390
Ohh...

06:52.459 --> 06:53.858
Just relax.

06:53.927 --> 06:54.859
Relax.

06:54.928 --> 06:55.986
Sittin' on

06:56.062 --> 06:58.326
The dock of the bay

06:58.398 --> 06:59.330
Watching the

06:59.399 --> 07:02.425
Tiiiiiide

07:02.502 --> 07:04.595
Roll away

07:04.671 --> 07:05.899
Ooh ooh

07:06.906 --> 07:08.066
All right, again, Mr. Henderson,

07:08.141 --> 07:09.972
there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

07:10.043 --> 07:11.305
So take those for insomnia.

07:11.377 --> 07:13.368
Give me a call if anything changes.
All right?

07:13.446 --> 07:14.970
- All right.
- Do me a favor.

07:15.048 --> 07:17.710
Stop being so hard
on yourself, Mr. Henderson.

07:17.784 --> 07:19.411
Retirement can be a tough transition.

07:19.486 --> 07:20.475
All right?

07:30.697 --> 07:33.564
Okay. Oh, yeah. Hey, listen.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.601
Don't mix those sleeping pills with alcohol

07:35.668 --> 07:37.659
unless you want to kill yourself.

07:40.406 --> 07:41.964
Okay. Who's next?

07:42.041 --> 07:44.305
<i>And for those of you in the Southland,</i>

07:44.377 --> 07:47.642
<i>tomorrow's gonna be
another beautiful day with</i>

07:47.714 --> 07:49.272
<i>bright, sunny skies</i>

07:49.349 --> 07:51.613
<i>and temperatures into the mid-80s.</i>

07:51.684 --> 07:53.549
<i>A perfect day for some golf.</i>

07:53.620 --> 07:56.817
<i>And that's gonna continue
right into next week.</i>

07:56.890 --> 07:59.791
<i>Gorgeous blue skies
and sensationally warm.</i>

07:59.859 --> 08:02.020
<i>It doesn't get any better than that.</i>

08:03.062 --> 08:04.188
<i>This just in.</i>

08:04.264 --> 08:05.993
<i>Soul music fans around the globe</i>

08:06.065 --> 08:09.432
<i>are mourning the loss
of Marcus Hooks.</i>

08:09.502 --> 08:11.333
<i>The legendary singer and songwriter</i>

08:11.404 --> 08:13.770
<i>apparently suffered
a massive heart attack</i>

08:13.840 --> 08:16.468
<i>while performing last night
in front of a capacity crowd</i>

08:16.543 --> 08:19.444
<i>at Kungstrardgarden Park
in Stockholm, Sweden.</i>

08:19.512 --> 08:22.037
<i>His body's being
flown home to New York,</i>

08:22.115 --> 08:24.208
<i>where a memorial service
will be held next week.</i>

08:24.284 --> 08:26.616
<i>The seven-time Grammy Award winner</i>

08:26.686 --> 08:28.813

<i>I'll do anything for you</i>

08:31.624 --> 08:32.921
<i>We're back in just a moment.</i>

08:33.927 --> 08:35.655
Humh!

08:37.397 --> 08:39.159
Kezian Motors. Can I help you?

08:40.500 --> 08:41.489
Who?

08:44.070 --> 08:45.435
Hinds, telephone!

08:50.743 --> 08:52.176
Dealing drugs out of my garage?

08:52.245 --> 08:55.373
Listen, you doing something illegal,

08:55.448 --> 08:58.281
I'll find out and send your ass
back to prison

08:58.351 --> 09:01.684
so fucking fast, it will make
your black monkey head spin.

09:05.692 --> 09:06.886
You know, there was a time

09:06.960 --> 09:08.587
I would've knocked your teeth
down your throat

09:08.661 --> 09:10.060
for saying some shit like that to me.

09:10.129 --> 09:11.460
But I'm a changed man.

09:11.531 --> 09:13.556
I'm trying to be
all centered and shit.

09:13.633 --> 09:16.625
Now, I could'a called you
a unibrow-shaving, pilaf-eating,

09:16.703 --> 09:18.500
greasy-ass goat fucker,
but I didn't, did I?

09:18.571 --> 09:20.766
- Uh-uh.
- 'Cause I didn't want to hurt your feelings,

09:20.840 --> 09:22.432
and I didn't want to piss you off,

09:22.508 --> 09:24.738
just like I know
deep, deep down inside,

09:24.811 --> 09:26.745
you don't want to piss me off, either.

09:26.813 --> 09:27.745
- Now, do you?
- Uh-uh.

09:27.814 --> 09:29.179
Uh-uh. No. Uh-uh.

09:29.249 --> 09:30.375
All right.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.145
Peace.

09:34.554 --> 09:35.816
Scruffy, Kibbles...

09:35.889 --> 09:37.447
Yeah, this is Louis.

09:37.523 --> 09:39.320
Hey. Mr. Hinds.

09:39.392 --> 09:41.690
It's Danny Epstein
calling from New York. How are you today?

09:41.761 --> 09:43.058
<i>Who?</i>

09:43.129 --> 09:44.061
Marty's son.

09:44.130 --> 09:45.392
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

09:45.465 --> 09:47.092
Shit,

09:47.166 --> 09:48.963
I ain't seen you since you were in diapers.

09:49.035 --> 09:49.967
<i>Yeah. Well,</i>

09:50.036 --> 09:50.968
I assume you heard

09:51.037 --> 09:52.368
about Marcus' passing, yeah?

09:52.438 --> 09:55.874
Oh, yeah. I'm crying the tears
of a motherfucking clown.

09:55.942 --> 09:58.308
Okay. Here's the thing.
VH1 is putting together

09:58.378 --> 10:00.141
a farewell tribute at the Apollo,

10:00.213 --> 10:02.306
<i>and they got a lot of big names lined up.</i>

10:02.382 --> 10:04.373
And they want Henderson and Hinds
to perform, right?

10:04.450 --> 10:06.918
That's right! The Real Deal
back together again.

10:06.986 --> 10:08.283
<i>It's a great opportunity.</i>

10:08.354 --> 10:09.878
You talk to Floyd?

10:09.956 --> 10:11.423
<i>I did.</i>

10:11.491 --> 10:12.981
Mr. Henderson is in.

10:13.059 --> 10:13.991
<i>Good.</i>

10:14.060 --> 10:15.459
Then I'm out.

10:24.270 --> 10:27.797
<i>Born under a bad sign</i>

10:29.575 --> 10:32.840
<i>Been down since I began to crawl</i>

10:34.180 --> 10:37.013
<i>If it wasn't for bad luck</i>

10:37.083 --> 10:40.280
<i>You know I wouldn't have
no luck at all</i>

10:45.024 --> 10:46.423
<i>Hard luck and trouble...</i>

11:10.783 --> 11:12.580
That is disgusting.

11:12.652 --> 11:14.085
Ooh!

11:15.989 --> 11:19.015
I don't believe this. Hmm.

11:19.092 --> 11:20.457
Hey!

11:20.526 --> 11:21.515
Uhh!

11:33.272 --> 11:35.399
Ohh. Damn!

11:36.943 --> 11:38.808
Ooh. Fuck happened, man?

11:38.878 --> 11:42.041
Hell if I know. I came in,
found your ass laying there.

11:42.115 --> 11:44.276
Bullshit.
You looked me dead in my eyes.

11:44.350 --> 11:45.408
Man, you recognized me.

11:45.485 --> 11:47.009
I didn't recognize you.
You done changed.

11:48.154 --> 11:49.348
I come all the way down here,

11:49.422 --> 11:50.855
and, man, you gonna
look me in my face

11:50.923 --> 11:52.891
- and knock me the fuck out?
- Should've called first.

11:52.959 --> 11:54.017
How the hell I'm gonna call

11:54.093 --> 11:55.185
and you ain't got no phone?

11:55.261 --> 11:57.229
What kind of person
ain't got no land phone?

11:57.296 --> 11:59.093
Kind of person don't want to get no calls.

11:59.165 --> 12:00.655
You don't even know
why I came down

12:00.733 --> 12:02.997
to this old fucked-up-the-ass
neighborhood.

12:03.069 --> 12:05.560
I talked to little Ep.
I know why you're here.

12:05.638 --> 12:08.004
And the answer is no.

12:08.074 --> 12:11.066
Did he tell you we're at the Apollo
and they sold out?

12:11.144 --> 12:13.078
Did he also tell you
who gonna be there?

12:13.146 --> 12:16.172
Booker T. Jones. Isaac Hayes.
Bootsy Collins.

12:16.249 --> 12:17.181
Shakira.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.239
I don't care.

12:18.317 --> 12:19.944
Do it for Marcus.

12:20.019 --> 12:21.281
Fuck Marcus.

12:21.354 --> 12:22.582
Well, do it for me.

12:22.655 --> 12:24.555
- Fuck you!
- Come on, man.

12:24.624 --> 12:26.216
- This is our shot.
- At what?

12:26.292 --> 12:28.783
At a comeback, fool.
If we do this shit right,

12:28.861 --> 12:31.091
we can get a record deal
and get back on the road

12:31.164 --> 12:32.688
like we was 30 years ago.

12:32.765 --> 12:34.494
I ain't trying to be like 30 years ago!

12:34.567 --> 12:36.034
I ain't trying to make no comeback.

12:36.102 --> 12:38.297
I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.

12:39.472 --> 12:41.337
Don't make me beg you, man.

12:42.875 --> 12:48.336
Lao-Tzu says, "Free from desire,
"you realize the mystery.

12:48.414 --> 12:51.781
"Caught in desire,
you see only the manifestations. "

12:52.952 --> 12:54.442
What the fuck
that even mean, man?

12:54.520 --> 12:56.147
That means...

12:58.624 --> 13:01.457
get the fuck out.

13:06.899 --> 13:09.060
Well, I guess you don't give a fuck
about the money, then, huh?

13:09.135 --> 13:11.000
What money? It's a funeral!

13:11.070 --> 13:13.334
Nobody get paid to sing
at no damn funeral!

13:14.874 --> 13:15.806
How much?

13:15.875 --> 13:17.240
40 grand.

13:17.310 --> 13:18.971
Apiece?

13:19.045 --> 13:20.239
No, down the middle.

13:20.313 --> 13:23.339
No, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no!

13:23.416 --> 13:24.644
That ain't even enough.

13:24.717 --> 13:26.582
What the fuck you mean
that's not enough, man?

13:26.652 --> 13:29.780
I got a lifestyle to maintain here.

13:29.856 --> 13:31.448
What kind of lifestyle, man,

13:31.524 --> 13:33.048
you filthy motherfucker?

13:33.126 --> 13:35.822
You got a pantry full of dog food.
I don't see no dog.

13:35.895 --> 13:37.419
Dog under the bed,
nigger! You lucky

13:37.497 --> 13:39.260
he ain't attacked your ass
when you came in.

13:39.332 --> 13:41.323
You're the dog, motherfucker!

13:44.003 --> 13:46.403
Look, man, what happened to all
that fucking money you done saved, man?

13:46.472 --> 13:48.702
Saved? Shit.

13:48.774 --> 13:51.242
I don't remember shit from Watergate

13:51.310 --> 13:52.834
to when the space shuttle blew up.

13:52.912 --> 13:54.072
Hmm. Money I saved.

13:54.147 --> 13:55.671
Okay, what about the royalties?
I used to get

13:55.748 --> 13:57.511
over $30,000 a year off that shit.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.347
I lost my royalties in a poker game.
All right?

14:00.419 --> 14:02.649
- Poker?
- Listen here, man.

14:02.722 --> 14:04.883
If you serious about un-assing me

14:04.957 --> 14:06.925
from my lavish surroundings here,

14:06.993 --> 14:08.893
man, you gonna have to be
a little more flexible

14:08.961 --> 14:12.055
in your thinking. Say, oh...

14:12.131 --> 14:13.155
60/40.

14:13.232 --> 14:15.325
Man, you must be higher
than a motherfucker.

14:15.401 --> 14:17.835
We always split shit
straight down the middle.

14:17.904 --> 14:19.531
Ain't gonna be nothing to split

14:19.605 --> 14:20.867
if I don't show up, now, is there?

14:20.940 --> 14:24.239
And I ain't showing up
unless I get 60%% % of the proceeds.

14:24.310 --> 14:25.538
You rich anyway, motherfucker.

14:25.611 --> 14:28.409
I seen your little car wash
commercials on the TV.

14:28.481 --> 14:31.279
I transferred all my business affairs
over to my nephew.

14:31.350 --> 14:33.375
- I'm on a fixed income, man.
- So what?

14:33.452 --> 14:35.352
So your drawers!

14:35.421 --> 14:37.082
That's why that 20 damn
thousand dollars

14:37.156 --> 14:39.090
- look good to me right now.
- 16!

14:39.158 --> 14:42.059
That's your cut of a 60/40 split.

14:42.128 --> 14:43.618
And those are my terms.

14:43.696 --> 14:45.664
And they're non-negotiable.

14:49.468 --> 14:51.493
55/45.

14:57.777 --> 14:59.540
Fatherfuck you, man.

14:59.612 --> 15:02.342
You're gonna tell me 60/40.

15:02.415 --> 15:04.212
You don't dictate to me!

15:04.283 --> 15:06.717
I'm Floyd motherfucking Henderson.

15:06.786 --> 15:08.310
You and Marc, I made you

15:08.387 --> 15:09.911
and that motherfucker!

15:09.989 --> 15:13.186
You can't sing, hum,
or motherfucking skip.

15:13.259 --> 15:14.590
Ain't that a bitch?

15:14.660 --> 15:16.457
Skip on these motherfucking nuts!

15:17.630 --> 15:20.064
You and Marcus, may you rest in shit.

15:20.132 --> 15:21.827
Motherfucker.
I'm Floyd fucking Henderson,

15:21.901 --> 15:24.096
you Apostle-faced motherfucker!

15:25.238 --> 15:27.729
This motherfucker slams this door
in my face one more time...

15:27.807 --> 15:29.399
I'm tired of this motherfucker!

15:31.043 --> 15:32.840
Always had a problem with this bitch.

15:34.247 --> 15:35.839
He ain't nothing. He's ignorant!

15:35.915 --> 15:38.076
Motherfucker's just a idiot.

15:38.150 --> 15:40.618
Chihuahua-head motherfucker, man,
sitting up there,

15:40.686 --> 15:42.779
always want to tell
somebody what to damn do.

15:42.855 --> 15:45.289
He gonna sit there and talk the fool?

15:45.358 --> 15:48.191
Ooh, my blood pressure's
high, motherfucker.

15:48.261 --> 15:49.353
Huh!

15:55.134 --> 15:57.568
Don't let this motherfucker
get you like this.

15:59.405 --> 16:00.394
Huhh!

16:03.809 --> 16:04.935
What!

16:05.011 --> 16:06.000
Stay!

16:11.717 --> 16:14.618
First of all, I clearly want
to state this for the record.

16:14.687 --> 16:17.815
And I find this arrangement we got,
man, despicable.

16:17.890 --> 16:20.484
But I'm Floyd Henderson.
I'm a trouper.

16:20.559 --> 16:22.959
And you know I'd do
any doggone thing, man,

16:23.029 --> 16:24.860
to see this group get back on its feet,

16:24.930 --> 16:26.795
'cause you know
that's the type of motherfucker I am.

16:26.866 --> 16:28.333
But in the meantime,

16:28.401 --> 16:32.030
I'm going back
to my $600-a-night hotel room,

16:32.104 --> 16:34.868
and I'm gonna have me
a nice hot bubble bath

16:34.940 --> 16:37.465
to wash some of this
filth and dirt and grime

16:37.543 --> 16:40.603
from this black
fucking hole you live in.

16:40.680 --> 16:44.116
Then I'm having me
a nice, juicy-ass steak, oh, yeah,

16:44.183 --> 16:46.947
the size of your
motherfucking back.

16:47.019 --> 16:50.113
Then I'm gonna take me
a shit shower and shave.

16:50.189 --> 16:52.157
And I'll be here at 6 a. m.

16:52.224 --> 16:53.691
To take you to the motherfucking
airport.

16:53.759 --> 16:54.953
You got me? I don't fly.

16:55.027 --> 16:56.255
And I get up at 8.

16:59.332 --> 17:00.697
My cousin out the penitentiary,

17:00.766 --> 17:02.597
I'm gonna have him kill
this motherfucker!

17:04.103 --> 17:06.263
Man talk to me like
I'm a motherfucking kid.

17:06.339 --> 17:07.464
I ain't no motherfucking kid.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.872
Every time we... we start on the road,

17:09.942 --> 17:12.705
he starts in saying the same shit.

17:12.912 --> 17:15.175
Hey! Who's got my lunch?

17:15.247 --> 17:16.179
Who are you?

17:16.248 --> 17:17.306
I'm Phillip Newman, sir,

17:17.383 --> 17:18.714
the new intern. You hired me,

17:18.784 --> 17:19.978
like, 20 minutes ago.

17:20.051 --> 17:21.519
Chuckles Newman's my uncle.

17:21.587 --> 17:22.917
- He's the one that told you...
- Stop talking.

17:22.988 --> 17:24.648
Very good. I already got a job for you.

17:24.723 --> 17:26.281
Okay? Bing, bang, boom.
Look at that.

17:26.358 --> 17:28.850
Yeah. Henderson and Hinds,
Marcus' old backup singers,

17:28.928 --> 17:30.759
are being real dickheads
about this tribute thing...

17:30.830 --> 17:33.025
Oh, my God! Henderson and Hinds!
The Real Deal.

17:33.099 --> 17:34.691
They're the only band
that got to play three songs

17:34.767 --> 17:36.166
<i>on a sing episode of Soul Train.</i>

17:36.235 --> 17:38.897
Don Cornelius was there as a witness,
and I got it on VHS.

17:38.971 --> 17:40.495
They don't do that here. All right?

17:40.573 --> 17:42.234
- Yes, sir.
- This is a record label,

17:42.308 --> 17:43.366
not a fan club.

17:43.442 --> 17:45.410
I want those two old fucks
there on Saturday,

17:45.478 --> 17:47.105
and I want you to make that happen.

17:47.179 --> 17:48.111
Got it?

18:14.807 --> 18:17.708
The Real Deal is back,
and they not gonna stop us now.

18:17.777 --> 18:19.142
Uh-huh.

18:19.211 --> 18:20.803
Ohh! Shit.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.869
Ohh...

18:22.882 --> 18:24.315
What the fuck is that, man?

18:24.383 --> 18:25.782
This is a gun.

18:25.851 --> 18:28.081
I never travel through Klan country
without one.

18:28.154 --> 18:29.644
- You got a problem with that, pops?
- Yeah,

18:29.722 --> 18:30.882
I got a problem with that, man.

18:30.956 --> 18:32.355
The last time I saw that gun,

18:32.425 --> 18:33.949
you were pointing at me,
and you were shooting it.

18:34.026 --> 18:36.256
Listen here, Floyd.
We ain't two old friends

18:36.328 --> 18:37.386
out for some Sunday drive

18:37.463 --> 18:38.760
down Memory Lane. All right?

18:38.831 --> 18:41.732
Fact is, I can hardly stand
the sight of your ass,

18:41.801 --> 18:44.167
so you best not to provoke me.

18:44.236 --> 18:45.362
Or what's gonna happen?

18:45.438 --> 18:47.099
There's a lot of empty road

18:47.173 --> 18:49.368
between here and where we trying to go.

18:49.442 --> 18:50.568
Where a nigger could disappear

18:50.643 --> 18:52.406
and where nobody'd
miss his black ass.

18:54.246 --> 18:56.146
Well, let me see that gun.

18:57.383 --> 18:58.941
Let me see it!

18:59.018 --> 19:00.280
Be careful, fool.

19:00.352 --> 19:02.320
You don't think I know
how to hold a gun, man?

19:02.388 --> 19:03.980
I'm a member of the NRA, man.

19:04.056 --> 19:05.683
Ohh!

19:05.758 --> 19:07.851
Where's... Now, what's... God damn it!

19:07.927 --> 19:08.859
Oh! Shit!

19:09.995 --> 19:11.257
- Damn!
- Ohh!

19:12.765 --> 19:14.630
Drive! Drive!
God damn it it, drive!

19:14.700 --> 19:15.667
- Ohh!
- Help me!

19:15.734 --> 19:16.860
Aaahh!

19:16.936 --> 19:18.164
Grab the wheel, fool!

19:18.237 --> 19:21.365
- Look out!
- Now, turn! Turn!

19:23.442 --> 19:24.374
Ohh!

19:24.443 --> 19:26.240
What the hell is wrong with you!

19:26.312 --> 19:28.143
Don't shoot no gun in a car!

19:28.214 --> 19:30.978
You said... The safety
wasn't on there.

19:31.050 --> 19:32.847
Safety, my ass!

19:32.918 --> 19:34.317
Safety wasn't...

19:34.386 --> 19:35.375
Ohh...

19:36.689 --> 19:38.156
NRA!

19:38.224 --> 19:40.158
Negro Retards' Association!

19:40.226 --> 19:42.160
Dumb motherfucker.

20:11.490 --> 20:13.287
What the fuck is that?

20:14.326 --> 20:16.089
R- E-S-P-E-C-T.

20:17.530 --> 20:20.226
Been a long time
since we saw our name in lights.

20:20.299 --> 20:22.961
What our name doing up in lights?

20:24.069 --> 20:26.128
We're at the Apollo Theater
this weekend.

20:26.205 --> 20:28.469
We ain't been on stage
in over 30 years.

20:28.541 --> 20:30.133
Now, the last thing you want to do

20:30.209 --> 20:31.836
is stink up the joint. Am I right?

20:31.911 --> 20:33.572
And I got us free dinner to boot.

20:41.620 --> 20:44.555
Man, we sure are lucky
I kept these threads.

20:44.623 --> 20:46.147
Do we look good!

20:46.225 --> 20:48.420
Better hope that button
don't pop off and kill nobody.

20:49.862 --> 20:52.888
God damn, I wish these pants
weren't squeezing my nuts so tight.

20:52.965 --> 20:54.796
Maybe it'll help you
hit those high notes.

20:54.867 --> 20:57.427
I don't need help
hitting the high notes.

20:57.503 --> 20:59.801
Yeah, right. We'll see. We'll see.

21:01.473 --> 21:04.271
Ha ha! Busting out.

21:05.277 --> 21:06.301
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:06.378 --> 21:08.369
tonight, the Flagstaff Motor Inn

21:08.447 --> 21:11.109
is proud to present
to you back onstage

21:11.183 --> 21:13.344
for the first time
in nearly three decades

21:13.419 --> 21:16.388
the unforgettable
sweet soul sounds of...

21:21.060 --> 21:23.620
The Real Deal!

21:23.696 --> 21:24.924
Whoo!

21:33.606 --> 21:34.937
Don't you ever

21:35.941 --> 21:37.636
Be sad

21:37.710 --> 21:39.837
Lean on me

21:39.912 --> 21:41.573
When times are bad

21:41.647 --> 21:44.582
When the day comes

21:44.650 --> 21:46.550
And you are down

21:46.619 --> 21:48.746
In a river of trouble

21:48.821 --> 21:50.789
And are about to drown

21:50.856 --> 21:52.687
Just hold on

21:52.758 --> 21:55.659
I'm coming

21:55.728 --> 21:57.889
Hold on

21:57.963 --> 21:59.157
I'm coming

22:00.165 --> 22:02.497
On my way

22:02.568 --> 22:04.502
Your lover

22:04.570 --> 22:06.561
When you be cold

22:06.639 --> 22:07.731
I'll be your cover

22:09.274 --> 22:11.071
Don't have to worry

22:11.143 --> 22:13.338
- 'Cause I'm here
- Yeah.

22:13.412 --> 22:15.539
No need to summon me there

22:15.614 --> 22:16.979
'Cause I'm here

22:17.049 --> 22:18.209
Yea-ah

22:18.283 --> 22:20.012
Hold on

22:20.085 --> 22:21.609
I'm coming

22:21.687 --> 22:24.349
Yipes!

22:24.423 --> 22:26.516
I'm coming

22:26.592 --> 22:28.389
Just hold on

22:29.395 --> 22:31.192
I'm coming

22:31.263 --> 22:33.458
Just hold on

22:33.532 --> 22:34.590
I'm coming

22:35.668 --> 22:39.536
Look here. Reach out to me

22:39.605 --> 22:41.971
for some satisfaction.

22:43.642 --> 22:45.234
You know, Floyd, all she got to do

22:45.310 --> 22:48.074
Is call my name

22:48.147 --> 22:50.672
For quick reaction

22:50.749 --> 22:52.341
Yeah, yeah, yeah

22:52.418 --> 22:54.384
Yeah

22:54.453 --> 22:55.385
Ooh! Aah!

22:55.454 --> 22:56.716
Ooh!

22:56.789 --> 22:58.916
Ooh! Ooh, ooh! Ooh!

22:58.991 --> 23:00.322
Aaah!

23:03.062 --> 23:04.552
Lou, Lou, you all right?
You all right?

23:04.630 --> 23:07.360
I can't breathe!

23:07.433 --> 23:08.661
Louis.

23:08.734 --> 23:10.429
Ohh!
Keep going. Keep going.

23:10.502 --> 23:11.434
I can't breathe.

23:17.409 --> 23:19.070
Ladies and gentlemen,
please forgive us

23:19.144 --> 23:20.202
for this technical difficulty.

23:20.279 --> 23:21.678
Ow!

23:21.747 --> 23:23.044
Aah!

23:23.115 --> 23:24.946
Fucking eye, man!

23:25.017 --> 23:27.042
I'm sorry, man.
I got on these tight slacks!

23:27.119 --> 23:28.848
Well, then, I'll sue your fat ass!

23:28.921 --> 23:29.888
You sue these nuts.

23:29.955 --> 23:31.718
- Go on, get on outta here.
- Jesus!

23:31.790 --> 23:32.950
Take it from the top.

23:33.025 --> 23:34.424
How are we gonna
take it from the top?

23:34.493 --> 23:35.858
- I'm rewed up to go, man,
- You can't hardly breathe.

23:35.928 --> 23:37.122
- You may need a chest X-ray.
- I'm good!

23:37.196 --> 23:38.390
Is there a doctor in the house?

23:38.464 --> 23:40.364
I love you, Debbie.

23:40.432 --> 23:42.593
Get off me, Ernest T!

23:42.668 --> 23:44.397
Lou. Lou. Lou. Calm down, man.

23:44.470 --> 23:46.097
Ain't but 12 motherfuckers out here, man.

23:46.171 --> 23:47.695
It's still a audience!

23:47.773 --> 23:49.934
I don't care if it's two or three.
It's a audience.

23:50.008 --> 23:51.100
That's what I'm talking about.

23:51.176 --> 23:52.575
Your attitude is fd up.

23:52.644 --> 23:54.908
Same thing that messed us up
back in the day.

23:54.980 --> 23:57.107
No. You know what fucked our shit up
back in the day?

23:57.182 --> 23:58.114
No. I don't know.

23:58.183 --> 23:59.548
Oh, you know goddamn well

23:59.618 --> 24:00.880
what fucked our shit up back in the day.

24:00.953 --> 24:02.614
- Oh, I do, huh?
- Yes, you do!

24:02.688 --> 24:04.553
What fucked our shit up
back in the day

24:04.623 --> 24:08.320
was you sticking your johnson
in my woman!

24:08.393 --> 24:10.122
Ooh.

24:21.740 --> 24:23.640
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:23.709 --> 24:24.937
I'm Floyd Henderson.

24:25.010 --> 24:26.637
This fool is Louis Hinds.

24:26.712 --> 24:29.306
We are The Real Deal,
and that's for real.

24:29.381 --> 24:33.750
I want to thank you for being
a super audience here tonight.

24:33.819 --> 24:35.684
Motherfucker.

24:35.754 --> 24:37.984
I'm sorry I hit you, Debbie. Come back.

24:38.056 --> 24:40.581
Shut the fuck up,
or I'll knock your dick in the dirt.

24:41.660 --> 24:42.991
Drunk son of a bitch.

24:43.061 --> 24:44.221
Ohh...

24:47.866 --> 24:49.800
<i>Happy</i>

24:49.868 --> 24:51.768
Hey, Louis, are we gonna talk
about last night,

24:51.837 --> 24:53.327
or we just gonna let it fester?

24:55.440 --> 24:58.773
All right. Well, I was
a little rusty, okay?

24:58.844 --> 25:00.436
That's a insult to rust, ain't it?

25:00.512 --> 25:02.104
Well, what about you,
motherfucker?

25:02.181 --> 25:04.911
Last night, look like you were
stuck in cement.

25:04.983 --> 25:06.177
I had a hip replacement, Louis.

25:06.251 --> 25:07.878
Well, you should've paid
a hundred more dollars

25:07.953 --> 25:09.978
and got the deluxe model
with some rhythm in it.

25:10.055 --> 25:11.886
'Cause that motherfucker you got,

25:11.957 --> 25:14.050
- it ain't working.
- Oh, that's fine, man.

25:14.126 --> 25:15.184
But that's not what we talking about.

25:15.260 --> 25:16.818
I'm talking about Odetta.

25:17.830 --> 25:18.888
Oh.

25:18.964 --> 25:20.158
Louis, if I thought there was still

25:20.232 --> 25:21.699
- gonna be a problem between us...
- You went

25:21.767 --> 25:23.667
where you shouldn't have gone,

25:23.735 --> 25:25.134
period!

25:25.204 --> 25:26.330
Now, there's some shit

25:26.405 --> 25:28.236
that's just etched in stone.

25:28.307 --> 25:30.207
First and foremost is

25:30.275 --> 25:34.678
thou shall not dig for diamonds
in another brother's mine!

25:34.746 --> 25:37.476
Bullshit, man. You gotta take
some responsibility here.

25:37.549 --> 25:38.641
You think she didn't know, man,

25:38.717 --> 25:39.843
about all of your smoking

25:39.918 --> 25:41.146
and drinking and drugs

25:41.220 --> 25:42.687
and other women? She knew.

25:42.754 --> 25:44.745
She came running to me
telling, "My man

25:44.823 --> 25:47.815
Louis did this. Louis did that.
Hold me, Floyd. "

25:47.893 --> 25:49.224
All right, well, getting the pussy
is one thing.

25:49.294 --> 25:50.727
- You ain't had to marry her.
- What?

25:50.796 --> 25:52.195
You'd have to be a zip-down fool

25:52.264 --> 25:53.925
to let her slide
through your fingers, man.

25:53.999 --> 25:55.728
All right, well, if I'm a fool,
then you are, too.

25:55.801 --> 25:58.565
You think I don't know that?
She hurt my heart, too.

25:58.637 --> 26:02.198
Good!
That's a poor motherfucking comfort.

26:02.274 --> 26:05.539
But it's comfort, nonetheless.

26:05.611 --> 26:06.839
<i>Every night I'm telling</i>

26:06.912 --> 26:08.436
<i>Whoopie</i>

26:08.513 --> 26:10.572
<i>Every time you're here, you're making</i>

26:10.649 --> 26:12.514
<i>- Whoopie
- Whool</i>

26:12.584 --> 26:14.074
<i>Whoopie</i>

26:23.395 --> 26:26.387
Well, how many times did you say
you was married after Odetta?

26:28.233 --> 26:29.894
Four.

26:29.968 --> 26:31.026
Ohh!

26:31.103 --> 26:34.038
I married this girl named Estelle
to get over Odetta.

26:34.106 --> 26:35.573
Then I married Henrietta.

26:35.641 --> 26:37.836
She wasn't no good for me.

26:37.910 --> 26:39.207
Then I married Josephine.

26:39.278 --> 26:42.247
She definitely wasn't no good for me
because she met Carl.

26:42.314 --> 26:44.305
All right. That's three.

26:44.383 --> 26:46.078
Who was lucky number four?

26:46.151 --> 26:47.982
Her name was Consuelo.

26:49.054 --> 26:50.681
She left me and went back to Cuba.

26:50.756 --> 26:53.748
Ha ha ha!
People actually go back to Cuba?

26:53.825 --> 26:55.918
She said she'd rather
spend the rest of her life

26:55.994 --> 26:58.326
under that dictatorship
than spend another night with me.

27:00.866 --> 27:02.993
How 'bout you?
How come you never got married?

27:03.068 --> 27:05.901
I almost hooked up
with this girl down in the Philippines,

27:05.971 --> 27:06.960
in Manila.

27:08.373 --> 27:11.171
- Wow.
- But, uh, I couldn't learn to speak

27:11.243 --> 27:13.336
Tagalog, and only English she knew

27:13.412 --> 27:15.403
was, "Me love you
long time for two dollar. "

27:17.683 --> 27:20.675
Yeah, I wasn't no good
at relationships after Odetta.

27:20.752 --> 27:22.049
You ever hear from her?

27:22.120 --> 27:23.348
Who, Mai Mai?

27:23.422 --> 27:24.354
No. Odetta.

27:24.423 --> 27:26.414
Oh. No, man.

27:27.726 --> 27:28.886
I heard from her, man.

27:28.961 --> 27:30.428
It was sometime around Christmas.

27:30.495 --> 27:33.362
You know, in that place
she was living in Tulsa. You know?

27:34.733 --> 27:36.667
Fuck it.
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

27:36.735 --> 27:38.362
What you doing?

27:38.437 --> 27:40.166
- I saw a coyote.
- Whyn't you put that thing up

27:40.238 --> 27:41.535
before somebody get hurt, man?

27:41.606 --> 27:42.971
How come you think
I don't know how to handle

27:43.041 --> 27:44.406
- no damn piece, man?
- Think?

27:45.444 --> 27:46.968
I know.

27:47.045 --> 27:49.013
Yeah?

27:49.081 --> 27:51.413
Yeah, come fuck with me now, Louis.

27:51.483 --> 27:52.950
Come on. You think I'm soft, huh?

27:53.018 --> 27:56.010
Yeah.
I'll bust one in your ass.

27:56.088 --> 27:57.680
Floyd, you keep fucking around,

27:57.756 --> 27:59.587
I'm gonna stick that gun
so far up your ass,

27:59.658 --> 28:01.489
you gonna taste gunpowder
every time you talk.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.391
- Well, let me...
- Shit!

28:08.734 --> 28:10.031
God damn it!

28:10.102 --> 28:11.660
Louis, that was a accident. I swear.

28:11.737 --> 28:13.830
I'm sweating. My hand's wet.

28:13.905 --> 28:15.338
You all right?

28:15.407 --> 28:16.874
You warm? You hot?

28:16.942 --> 28:18.807
You dizzy? You light-headed?

28:18.877 --> 28:21.175
Louis, I swear I would never want
to hurt you, man.

28:21.246 --> 28:23.476
I thought about killing you,
but I'd never want to hurt you.

28:23.548 --> 28:26.016
<i>All right.
In our continuing tribute to Marcus Hooks,</i>

28:26.084 --> 28:28.746
<i>we're reaching all the way back
in this next song.</i>

28:28.820 --> 28:31.721
Lou. That's us, man.

28:31.790 --> 28:33.781

29:03.588 --> 29:06.250

that motherfucker could sing.

29:06.324 --> 29:08.724
No doubt. No doubt.
Come on, help me... help me out.

29:08.794 --> 29:09.886

- Drop step.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.746
Drop step?
You know I can't do that right now.

29:38.824 --> 29:39.756
Go, Lou.

29:39.825 --> 29:41.156
- Owww!
- Man.

Oh, sweet. Do it, Louie.

30:53.031 --> 30:54.259
Louis Hinds

30:54.332 --> 30:57.062
Boogie on down

30:57.135 --> 30:58.193
Listen to the band

30:58.270 --> 31:00.363
We'll make it through

31:00.438 --> 31:02.998
All we got

31:03.074 --> 31:05.440
Is the boogie, too

31:05.510 --> 31:13.777
I got to boogie for you

31:13.852 --> 31:16.013
Whoo

31:16.087 --> 31:19.352
Hey, you, what you got, baby?
You got to boogie for me?

31:19.424 --> 31:22.825
Come on, now.
Oh, yeah

31:22.894 --> 31:24.862
Come on.

31:24.930 --> 31:26.864
Yeehaw!

31:26.932 --> 31:29.162
Come on, fiddler.

31:29.234 --> 31:31.327
I knew you were
gonna try to take over.

31:32.604 --> 31:35.004
Look at him.

31:35.073 --> 31:37.473
Go on, Lou.

31:37.542 --> 31:39.510
- Come on.
- Oww!

31:39.578 --> 31:41.239
Boogie ain't nothing

31:41.313 --> 31:43.406
But gettin' down

31:43.481 --> 31:45.642
Boogie ain't nothing

31:45.717 --> 31:48.083
But gettin' down

31:48.153 --> 31:50.815
Boogie ain't nothing
but getting down

31:50.889 --> 31:51.981
Ow!

31:52.057 --> 31:53.888
Boogie ain't nothing

31:53.959 --> 31:55.722
But getting down

31:55.794 --> 31:58.228
Come on.
I got to boogie for you

31:58.296 --> 32:04.894
I got to boogie for you

32:04.970 --> 32:07.404
I got nothing but boogie

32:07.472 --> 32:09.599
- Nothing but boogie for you
- Ooh

32:09.674 --> 32:11.335
- I got nothing but boogie
- Yeah

32:11.409 --> 32:12.842
Nothing but boogie for you

32:12.911 --> 32:15.573
- Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
- Oh, yeah

32:15.647 --> 32:17.945
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

32:18.016 --> 32:19.711
- Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
- Oh, yeah

32:19.784 --> 32:21.615
I got to boogie for you

32:21.686 --> 32:24.883
Aah!

32:30.795 --> 32:32.820
Share the love, baby.

32:32.897 --> 32:35.092
All right, all right.

32:35.166 --> 32:36.929
You know you pulled
the Al Green up there, right?

32:37.002 --> 32:38.697
No, I didn't, Lou. Don't start that...

32:38.770 --> 32:39.896
We barely got offstage

32:39.971 --> 32:41.632
when you ran your ass
back out there.

32:41.706 --> 32:44.300
Look, an encore
is at the audience's discretion.

32:44.376 --> 32:45.934
You're supposed to wait
till they ask for it.

32:46.011 --> 32:47.706
- You know they wanted it.
- I don't care what they wanted.

32:47.779 --> 32:49.542
That shit was unprofessional.

32:49.614 --> 32:50.945
Man...

32:54.919 --> 32:56.216
Say,

32:56.288 --> 32:59.587
I'm starting to remember
why I love the road so much.

32:59.658 --> 33:02.092
Yeah.

33:04.929 --> 33:08.160
Mmm.

33:08.233 --> 33:10.292
If my instincts serve me right,

33:10.368 --> 33:12.427
you're about to find
yourself another room tonight.

33:12.504 --> 33:15.337
You know those little blue pills
make you go blind, right?

33:15.407 --> 33:17.375
Mmm, mmm.

33:18.877 --> 33:21.368
Don't call me when you get
that four-hour erection.

33:21.446 --> 33:22.970
Hey, now, baby girl.

33:27.452 --> 33:28.578
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

33:28.653 --> 33:30.518
Oh. Aah!

33:30.588 --> 33:31.680
Yeah, give it to me.

33:33.191 --> 33:34.749
Those little pills, give me strength.

33:34.826 --> 33:35.986
A little strength.

33:36.061 --> 33:37.961
Ugh!

33:38.029 --> 33:39.291
I'm going to fuck your brains out.

33:39.364 --> 33:42.128
Oh! Oh, you're heavy.

33:44.602 --> 33:45.967
Uh,

33:46.037 --> 33:48.164
what's wrong, baby?

33:48.239 --> 33:49.501
Nothing.

33:49.574 --> 33:52.873
I just, uh, you know, I...

33:52.944 --> 33:55.139
I just never been with
someone like you before.

33:55.213 --> 33:57.875
It's true what they say.
But let me tell you something.

33:57.949 --> 34:00.315
Floyd Henderson gonna be
nice and gentle.

34:00.385 --> 34:02.080
Your first taste of dark meat

34:02.153 --> 34:03.984
gonna be smooth and sweet, trust me.

34:04.055 --> 34:05.215
No, I didn't mean that.

34:05.290 --> 34:07.588
It's just, uh, you know,

34:07.659 --> 34:10.992
I've never been with someone so old.

34:11.062 --> 34:12.222
Old?

34:12.297 --> 34:14.891
You ain't no teen queen
your damn self.

34:14.966 --> 34:16.831
Huh.

34:16.900 --> 34:18.163
Come on, come on, come on.

34:18.235 --> 34:19.828
Come on, mama. Come here, baby.

34:19.904 --> 34:21.132
Baby, baby. Look here.

34:21.206 --> 34:24.402
Let's take our decades
of sexual experience

34:24.476 --> 34:26.170
and combine them for one night

34:26.244 --> 34:28.041
of exploration and bliss,
can we do that?

34:28.112 --> 34:32.179
I won't disappoint you.

34:32.250 --> 34:34.514
All right.

34:34.585 --> 34:36.645
That's what I'm talking about.

34:36.721 --> 34:38.052
I want to suck one of them titties.

34:38.123 --> 34:40.591
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
something to show you.

34:40.658 --> 34:41.750
- Ooh.
- Ooh, hoo.

34:41.826 --> 34:44.021
I'm so hot, I'm about to fuck myself.

34:45.263 --> 34:46.286
Bite my lip off.

34:46.364 --> 34:48.228
Oh. Look!

34:48.299 --> 34:49.732
Oh, shoot, I'm leaking, girl.

34:49.801 --> 34:51.393
Tonight I ain't got no
control like that no more.

34:51.469 --> 34:55.199
Now, I hope you don't
mind a little hair.

34:55.273 --> 34:59.004
Baby, I found
my sexual awakening in the '60s.

34:59.077 --> 35:02.604
Nothing I like better
than a big old fluffy...

35:04.883 --> 35:06.043
Damn, girl.

35:06.117 --> 35:08.051
That's a whole bunch of hair
you got down there.

35:08.119 --> 35:10.087
Yeah, I call it the natural look.

35:11.122 --> 35:12.453
You sick?

35:12.524 --> 35:14.321
I know it's big.

35:14.392 --> 35:15.984
You need a pick.

35:16.060 --> 35:17.357
You want me to shave it?

35:17.429 --> 35:20.592
We ain't got the time or
apparatus for that type of job.

35:20.665 --> 35:22.394
Okay, disregard.

35:22.467 --> 35:23.593
Oh!

35:23.668 --> 35:24.828
- Oh!
- Oh!

35:24.903 --> 35:27.428
Look who's coming to dinner.

35:27.505 --> 35:29.336
Right on time, ain't it?

35:29.407 --> 35:30.840
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

35:30.909 --> 35:32.570
Oh.

35:32.644 --> 35:33.702
You know what I'm
gonna do for you?

35:33.778 --> 35:35.177
What you fixing to do?

35:35.246 --> 35:37.111
You ever had a velveteen rub?

35:37.182 --> 35:39.548
A velveteen rub.

35:39.617 --> 35:42.017
Ain't... Ain't no cheese involved, is there?

35:42.086 --> 35:43.986
Because I'm lactose intolerant.

35:50.762 --> 35:52.389
Oh, yeah.

36:01.072 --> 36:02.334
Ooh!

36:02.407 --> 36:03.965
You're choking my chicken!

36:16.221 --> 36:17.313
Ugh!

36:18.356 --> 36:19.721
Ugh.

36:19.791 --> 36:21.759
That's quite a show you got going

36:21.826 --> 36:23.794
under the big top there, Sparky.

36:23.862 --> 36:25.329
I had to take another
one of them damn pills

36:25.396 --> 36:26.624
in the middle of the night, man.

36:26.698 --> 36:28.666
This woman insatiable, man.
I'm shooting dust.

36:30.702 --> 36:31.634
Oh, Floyd.

36:31.703 --> 36:32.829
I'm right here, baby.

36:32.904 --> 36:34.064
You ready for some more?

36:34.138 --> 36:35.162
Yeah, come here.

36:36.875 --> 36:39.938
Come here.

36:40.011 --> 36:41.035
Hi.

36:41.112 --> 36:43.808
Think about that, boy.

36:43.882 --> 36:45.941
There's my stallion.

36:46.017 --> 36:47.279
Huh?

36:47.352 --> 36:49.013
- I missed you.
- Oh, you missed me?

36:49.087 --> 36:50.179
Mmm-hmm.

36:50.255 --> 36:52.223
Mmm. You need a little air
on this thing.

36:52.290 --> 36:54.383
Yeah.

36:54.459 --> 36:56.654
Oh, you bad boy.

36:56.728 --> 36:58.355
God damn.

36:58.429 --> 36:59.987
You like that, huh?

37:00.064 --> 37:01.656
I'm your little kitty cat.

37:04.569 --> 37:06.036
Chastity?

37:07.038 --> 37:09.266
Mama?

37:09.340 --> 37:10.568
You little whore.

37:10.642 --> 37:12.109
You're one to talk.

37:12.176 --> 37:14.576
Oh, did you take out
your teeth for him?

37:14.646 --> 37:16.637
You watch how you talk to your mama.

37:16.714 --> 37:18.306
Please, you can't
talk to me like that.

37:18.383 --> 37:19.441
You're not my daddy.

37:19.517 --> 37:20.541
That's right, who's your daddy?

37:20.618 --> 37:21.744
- You're my daddy.
- Your big daddy.

37:23.121 --> 37:24.611
Rosalee, are you in there?

37:24.689 --> 37:27.214
Actually, that's my daddy.

37:27.292 --> 37:28.486
Oh.

37:30.828 --> 37:31.920
What are you thinking, Mama?

37:31.996 --> 37:33.020
You ruined everything.

37:33.097 --> 37:35.156
- I hate you.
- You little brat.

37:35.233 --> 37:37.326
You're a dirty... all right, I love you.

37:37.402 --> 37:38.926
- Mmm.
- Call me a lot of times.

37:39.003 --> 37:41.301
Mama, what is wrong with you?

37:41.372 --> 37:43.602
- I renounce you. You're a whore.
- Aah!

37:43.675 --> 37:45.438
- I'm a whore?
- Yeah.

37:45.510 --> 37:48.035
You just shamed the whole family,
you and the black man.

37:51.449 --> 37:52.746
Whoa!

37:52.817 --> 37:54.682
Whoo! That was fun.

38:01.526 --> 38:04.586
<i>So come, take me by the hand</i>

38:04.662 --> 38:06.596
<i>We'll leave this troubled land</i>

38:06.664 --> 38:08.222
<i>- Yeah.
- I know we can</i>

38:08.299 --> 38:09.527
<i>I know we can</i>

38:09.601 --> 38:10.795
I'll be damned, man.

38:10.868 --> 38:12.631
Them broads stole our money, man.

38:12.704 --> 38:14.194
Whoo, yeah,

38:14.272 --> 38:16.672
but they earned it.

38:18.076 --> 38:19.304
Hello.

38:19.377 --> 38:20.844
<i>Yeah, man.
It's Floyd Henderson, man.</i>

38:20.912 --> 38:22.072
<i>We got a situation.</i>

38:22.146 --> 38:23.238
What's the problem?

38:23.314 --> 38:24.906
Well, my ex-partner,

38:24.983 --> 38:26.450
the degenerate that he is, man,

38:26.517 --> 38:29.577
got some trailer trash hos,
man, rip us off.

38:29.654 --> 38:31.315
<i>Oh, wow, I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

38:31.389 --> 38:32.686
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

38:32.757 --> 38:34.748
Yeah, there's something
you can do. We need money.

38:34.826 --> 38:35.918
<i>If we don't get no money,</i>

38:35.994 --> 38:37.461
<i>we ain't gonna make it to the Apollo.</i>

38:37.528 --> 38:39.826
I'm not sure what the procedure
for that would be.

38:39.897 --> 38:42.024
I mean, there's just
a lot of red tape here.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.533
You know, uh...

38:43.601 --> 38:45.626
I'm going to have to get back to you.

38:45.703 --> 38:48.297
<i>- You do that. Get back with me now.
- Mr. Henderson...</i>

38:48.373 --> 38:51.342
We ain't gonna get very far
on ten gallons of gas,

38:51.409 --> 38:53.775
I can tell you that.

38:53.845 --> 38:55.608
I know where we can
get some money.

38:55.680 --> 38:56.942
I know how to get some money.

39:02.854 --> 39:07.348
<i>Ain't no love, ain't no love</i>

39:07.425 --> 39:12.627
<i>Like my baby's love</i>

39:12.697 --> 39:15.894
<i>Ain't no lonely days</i>

39:16.901 --> 39:18.926
<i>Ain't no lonely</i>

39:19.003 --> 39:21.335
Ooh, shit. What the hell is...

39:21.406 --> 39:26.810
<i>'Cause I ain't never,
never found me a girl</i>

39:26.878 --> 39:29.210
Oh, hell, no. You didn't.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.009
Yes, I did.

39:31.082 --> 39:33.073
<i>- To love me like
- I do</i>

39:33.151 --> 39:35.483
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

39:35.553 --> 39:36.611
Hey.

39:36.688 --> 39:38.417
Hey, hey, you're...
What is wrong with you?

39:38.489 --> 39:40.218
Don't be grabbing on me like that now.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.725
I will knock your ass out
before I let you go ring that doorbell.

39:42.794 --> 39:44.227
Come on, get up
on me, man. Come on.

39:44.295 --> 39:46.024
You really want this? Huh?

39:46.097 --> 39:47.826
- Huh?
- Come on... Oh! God damn.

39:47.899 --> 39:48.991
- Oh, man. Come on...
- What?

39:49.067 --> 39:50.466
- Oh!
- What's wrong, what?

39:50.535 --> 39:51.661
I got a pain in my chest, man.

39:51.736 --> 39:53.260
Come on, man.
Stop fucking with me.

39:53.337 --> 39:54.361
Look like I'm fucking with you, man?

39:54.439 --> 39:55.531
Come on, man, do me a favor.

39:55.606 --> 39:57.096
Get my heart medicine
out of my bag.

39:57.175 --> 39:59.268
- You got some heart med...
- Oh! Come on, look.

39:59.343 --> 40:01.607
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

40:03.614 --> 40:04.876
Hold on, man!

40:06.284 --> 40:08.775
God damn, you got enough stuff in here
to start a drug store!

40:08.853 --> 40:10.252
What it say on the bottle?

40:10.321 --> 40:12.619
Sucker, motherfucker.

40:17.161 --> 40:19.527
I'm gonna get your ass for this.

40:19.597 --> 40:21.758
I'll leave the light on for you.

40:24.602 --> 40:26.229
What up, dawg?

40:27.271 --> 40:29.102
Um...

40:29.173 --> 40:31.198
We're friends of, uh, Odetta's.

40:31.275 --> 40:33.766
- Odetta?
- Yeah, is she in?

40:33.845 --> 40:35.540
No, she ain't here, man.

40:35.613 --> 40:37.877
Is she coming back?

40:37.949 --> 40:39.143
Seriously doubt it.

40:39.217 --> 40:42.380
Not unless we fitting to have
a zombie attack or some shit.

40:42.453 --> 40:44.387
Eee!

40:44.455 --> 40:45.649
What's up, Fu Manchu?

40:45.723 --> 40:47.588
- Cleo!
- Yeah?

40:47.658 --> 40:48.920
Get your ass out here!

40:48.993 --> 40:51.325
Two old niggers
looking for your mama.

40:52.630 --> 40:56.088
Come on in, man.
You're letting the heat out.

40:56.167 --> 40:57.293
Mama?

40:57.368 --> 40:58.426
Cold outside.

40:58.503 --> 41:00.164
Your arthritis gonna kick up.

41:03.708 --> 41:05.471
Who's that?

41:05.543 --> 41:07.033
I don't know.

41:12.183 --> 41:13.275
Yeah?

41:13.351 --> 41:14.978
Uh, how you doing, ma'am?

41:15.052 --> 41:16.417
My name is Floyd Henderson.
This is my...

41:16.487 --> 41:18.352
I know who you are.

41:18.422 --> 41:20.083
Guess you didn't hear
about the funeral.

41:20.158 --> 41:22.922
Funeral? Odetta...

41:22.994 --> 41:24.086
When did she pass?

41:24.162 --> 41:26.289
Well, she got sick right after Christmas.

41:26.364 --> 41:29.299
After that, it went pretty fast.

41:29.367 --> 41:31.460
So why'd you come to see her?

41:31.536 --> 41:32.696
What, she owe you
money or something?

41:32.770 --> 41:35.000
- Oh, no.
- We just in the neighborhood.

41:35.072 --> 41:37.540
Cleo, I can't find the bologna!

41:37.608 --> 41:39.371
I'll be there in a minute!

41:39.443 --> 41:41.172
Hurry up!

41:41.245 --> 41:45.705
Well, if my mama wasn't dead,
I'd tell her you stopped by.

41:45.783 --> 41:47.045
Cleo!

41:47.118 --> 41:50.144
- Just hold on a second.
- C-L-E-O!

41:50.221 --> 41:51.245
- What the hell you want?
- I'm sorry...

41:51.322 --> 41:52.584
I told you this was
a bad idea to come here.

41:52.657 --> 41:53.954
Come on, man. Don't go there.

41:54.025 --> 41:55.049
Let's just go, okay?

41:55.126 --> 41:56.150
How old you think she is?

41:56.227 --> 41:57.626
27, 28?

41:57.695 --> 41:59.526
I don't know how old she is,
and I don't care. Let's go.

41:59.597 --> 42:00.757
Chillax, let me see something.

42:00.832 --> 42:02.197
What are you doing?

42:02.266 --> 42:04.461
Floyd, what the hell
are you looking for?

42:04.535 --> 42:05.661
Damn it.

42:05.736 --> 42:07.033
I'm just confirming a suspicion.

42:07.104 --> 42:08.662
That's all I'm doing.

42:08.739 --> 42:11.867
September 14, 1981. Bingo.

42:11.943 --> 42:14.173
It kind of works itself out, don't it?

42:14.245 --> 42:15.439
Put it back.

42:17.148 --> 42:18.308
Listen.

42:18.382 --> 42:19.781
Odetta left me, man,

42:19.851 --> 42:22.479
Thanksgiving Day, man, 1980.

42:22.553 --> 42:24.544
- So?
- So you do the math, motherfucker.

42:24.622 --> 42:27.182
Do the math? Nigga, please...

42:27.258 --> 42:28.691
<i>Oh, shit. You hear that?</i>

42:28.759 --> 42:29.953
Hear what?

42:30.027 --> 42:32.689
Listen, that bass line, right there.

42:32.763 --> 42:34.924
Hmm?

42:34.999 --> 42:36.728
Son of a bitch.

42:36.934 --> 42:40.165
Oh, my name is Lester,
the Court Jester

42:40.238 --> 42:42.206
All you other rap niggas
done messed up

42:42.273 --> 42:43.763
I take you to school a semester

42:43.841 --> 42:45.331
Take you to court and sequester

42:45.409 --> 42:47.343
- Yeah!
- I'm judge and the jury

42:47.411 --> 42:49.106
<i>Bruce Lee, Fists of Fury.</i>

42:49.180 --> 42:51.375
You want to whip me,
the L-E-S-T-E-R

42:53.184 --> 42:54.082
Grab my girl by the waist

42:54.151 --> 42:55.448
Slap my girl in the face

42:55.519 --> 42:57.714
When my mama died,
I moved inside her crib

42:57.788 --> 43:00.586
Hey, hey. Les, Les.

43:00.658 --> 43:02.558
Hey, man, what you doing in here?

43:02.627 --> 43:04.788
We're here trying to make some music.

43:04.862 --> 43:07.353
That what y'all doing?

43:07.431 --> 43:08.625
I don't see no musicians.

43:08.699 --> 43:11.065
Listen, you know who played the base line

43:11.135 --> 43:13.797
on that stuff you got running
under those so-called lyrics?

43:13.871 --> 43:16.499
My man, right there.

43:17.975 --> 43:19.272
Yeah, right, man.

43:19.343 --> 43:22.870
He ain't no damn instrumentator.

43:22.947 --> 43:24.574
Hey, yo, Big L, check it out, man.
It's them, man.

43:24.649 --> 43:25.843
They ain't bullshitting.

43:25.917 --> 43:27.179
Let me see this here.

43:27.251 --> 43:29.549
The Real Deal, huh?

43:29.620 --> 43:32.316
Hey, I mean, so what if we
jacked your shit, man? Huh?

43:32.390 --> 43:34.824
Good artists borrow,

43:34.892 --> 43:36.723
great artists steal, man.

43:36.794 --> 43:39.262
- You know who said that?
- Pablo Picasso.

43:39.330 --> 43:42.458
But literary scholars sometimes
like to attribute it to T.S. Eliot.

43:42.533 --> 43:45.934
Hell, no. It wasn't no damn
Missy Elliot, man.

43:46.003 --> 43:48.233
No, man, it was Bay Bay and them.

43:48.306 --> 43:49.432
Bay Bay, yup.

43:49.507 --> 43:51.805
That was Bay Bay,
for sure, hey, Bay Bay.

43:51.876 --> 43:52.900
Look, man.

43:52.977 --> 43:54.638
You know what? I'm sorry.

43:54.712 --> 43:56.771
I shouldn't have sampled
your music without permission.

43:56.847 --> 43:59.111
Why don't we all do a song together?

43:59.183 --> 44:01.651
A song called "Fuck You
and Your Bass Line. "

44:01.719 --> 44:03.482
That's what I feel about it.

44:03.554 --> 44:05.488
Here what I think
about your damn bassline.

44:05.556 --> 44:08.150
Henderson and Hinds!

44:08.225 --> 44:09.249
Take that shit with you.

44:09.327 --> 44:10.919
Gold-faced motherfucker.

44:10.995 --> 44:12.121
I made that shit gangster,
that's what I did.

44:12.196 --> 44:13.595
Let me tell you something,
man, you...

44:13.664 --> 44:15.791
Hey! Stop it!

44:18.436 --> 44:19.664
Stop it!

44:19.737 --> 44:21.432
Hey! This is my house.
You hear me?

44:21.505 --> 44:22.870
I don't need this shit right now.

44:22.940 --> 44:24.999
You gonna talk to me crazy
in front of my boys?

44:25.076 --> 44:27.306
Why you still talking?
Shut the fuck up!

44:27.378 --> 44:29.778
Pay-Pay and Zig-Zig,

44:29.847 --> 44:31.872
let's dip, man.

44:34.418 --> 44:35.749
Bye, old niggers.

44:35.820 --> 44:39.312
Feel free to utilize
my facilities while you're here

44:39.390 --> 44:40.687
to make yourself another hit.

44:40.758 --> 44:44.194
I know you ain't had a hit
since Ike hit Tina.

44:44.261 --> 44:45.228
Get out of here.

44:45.296 --> 44:48.356
Get the fuck

44:48.432 --> 44:50.696
Out my grill

44:50.768 --> 44:53.168
'Fore you get killed

44:53.237 --> 44:55.933
My name is Lester the Court Jester.

44:56.007 --> 44:58.874
What a disrespectful son of a bitch.

44:58.943 --> 45:01.343
- Just lay off.
- Just lay off?

45:01.412 --> 45:03.039
I know your mama taught you better.

45:03.114 --> 45:04.581
Odetta would've
whooped his damn ass.

45:04.648 --> 45:06.980
The fuck you know about
what my mama would've done.

45:07.051 --> 45:09.383
Were you here when she was
dying of that cancer?

45:09.453 --> 45:11.887
I don't think so. I think Lester was.
The hell you know.

45:11.956 --> 45:13.218
You're right. I don't know nothing.

45:13.290 --> 45:14.689
That's right, he don't know shit.

45:14.759 --> 45:16.522
No, he don't.

45:16.594 --> 45:19.392
Now I'm going to go change
and get dinner started

45:19.463 --> 45:21.055
because you guys
are staying, right?

45:21.132 --> 45:22.258
Oh, no. We need to hit the road.

45:22.333 --> 45:24.392
Yes, ma'am. We are staying.

45:26.470 --> 45:27.732
Okay, then.

45:29.073 --> 45:31.371
Hell, it's what Mama would've wanted.

45:31.442 --> 45:34.536
Oh, yeah. That's Odetta's
child, all right.

45:41.085 --> 45:45.385
Okay, I put some sheets on the bed
in the guest room for you guys.

45:45.456 --> 45:47.686
Thank you.

45:47.758 --> 45:49.885
That's Carla Thomas, right?

45:49.960 --> 45:52.554
Sure is. Your mother's favorite.

45:54.265 --> 45:57.325
So how come you guys only
put out that one album?

45:59.336 --> 46:01.270
Well, when we wasn't
fighting over your mother,

46:01.338 --> 46:02.600
we had a problem
in our record sales.

46:02.673 --> 46:04.641
Yeah, as in we didn't sell any.

46:04.708 --> 46:05.868
Okay.

46:07.611 --> 46:10.808
Well, you'd never know it wasn't a hit,

46:10.881 --> 46:12.906
as much as Mama played it.

46:17.988 --> 46:20.821
About 100 degrees, and you
got a leather jacket on.

46:20.891 --> 46:22.153
Appreciate it, Sam.

46:23.727 --> 46:25.888
She said,

46:25.963 --> 46:27.624
being on the road with y'all

46:27.698 --> 46:30.963
was some of the best times of her life.

46:31.035 --> 46:34.664
Oh, good days. Good days.

46:34.738 --> 46:37.332
I wish I could've seen that.

46:37.408 --> 46:41.640
Say, why don't you
come to Memphis with us?

46:41.712 --> 46:43.839
- Memphis?
- Yeah.

46:43.914 --> 46:45.848
- What?
- We got a gig.

46:45.916 --> 46:47.008
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Floyd, Floyd.

46:47.084 --> 46:48.176
The girl got a life.

46:48.252 --> 46:49.344
She ain't got time to be ripping,

46:49.420 --> 46:50.853
running up and down the road
with two old niggers.

46:50.921 --> 46:52.388
Why not?

46:52.456 --> 46:55.016
Memphis is fun.
We always have fun in Memphis.

46:55.092 --> 46:56.184
You'll enjoy it. Trust me.

46:56.260 --> 46:59.889
Fun? Look like I got time for fun?

47:01.065 --> 47:02.225
Nah.

47:10.508 --> 47:11.975
Hey, Louis.

47:12.042 --> 47:15.102
You know, Cleo was telling me

47:15.179 --> 47:17.204
that Odetta never told her nothing
about her father,

47:17.281 --> 47:19.545
not even his name.

47:19.617 --> 47:21.380
But she did say
he was a musician.

47:21.452 --> 47:22.976
You ain't said nothing stupid
to the girl, have you?

47:23.053 --> 47:24.145
Like what?

47:24.221 --> 47:27.019
Oh, like, uh,

47:27.091 --> 47:28.319
Cleo, you know, I'm your daddy.

47:28.392 --> 47:31.054
Well, I'm still
feeling out the situation.

47:31.128 --> 47:32.390
What the fuck was that

47:32.463 --> 47:34.090
that "You ought to come
to Memphis with us" shit?

47:34.165 --> 47:37.498
Now that, right there,
that's a recipe for disaster.

47:37.568 --> 47:40.833
Louis, Louis, I know
this ain't easy for you.

47:40.905 --> 47:43.373
But I never thought I'd have a child.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.237
Now I'm part of this big
old circle called life.

47:45.309 --> 47:50.303
A piece of Floyd Henderson,
man, might be here to live on,

47:50.381 --> 47:51.814
and maybe forever.

47:51.882 --> 47:53.747
If you don't shut up
and go to sleep,

47:53.817 --> 47:57.184
a big piece of Floyd Henderson ass
might not wake up in the morning.

47:57.254 --> 47:59.017
Oh, Louis, Louis.

47:59.089 --> 48:00.647
I respect the fact that you want

48:00.724 --> 48:03.124
to cloak your pain with your anger.

48:08.232 --> 48:12.025
Good night.

48:18.943 --> 48:20.843
Oh, hey! What the fuck is that?

48:20.911 --> 48:21.969
What's wrong?

48:22.046 --> 48:23.638
You been taking
them dick pills again?

48:23.714 --> 48:26.080
I though it was my cholesterol meds,
I swear I did.

48:26.150 --> 48:28.414
You can't be spooning
with a motherfucker with that!

48:28.485 --> 48:29.645
What's wrong with you?

48:29.720 --> 48:32.245
- Uh, I...
- Nasty son of a bitch!

48:32.323 --> 48:33.813
Give me some covers.
I'm gonna sleep on the floor.

48:33.891 --> 48:34.949
Shit.

48:35.025 --> 48:36.549
Go on, then. Sleep on the floor.

48:36.627 --> 48:37.685
Nobody wants you, Louis.

48:37.761 --> 48:39.661
I don't like boy pussy no way.

48:39.730 --> 48:41.197
I hope your back hurt
like a motherfucker.

48:41.265 --> 48:43.699
Better my back than my asshole.

48:43.767 --> 48:45.860
Nasty... I'll beat
your motherfucking...

48:45.936 --> 48:47.836
All them years I spent in prison,

48:47.905 --> 48:49.839
ain't nobody roll up on me like that.

48:49.907 --> 48:51.499
I was going to ask you about that.

48:51.575 --> 48:53.873
You ought to be ashamed
of your goddamn self,

48:53.944 --> 48:55.377
nasty son of a bitch.

49:13.130 --> 49:16.122
Like I never had

49:22.906 --> 49:25.875
When I'm feeling bad

49:25.943 --> 49:29.572
Come on and comfort me

49:29.647 --> 49:33.378
Oh, baby, you know the way

49:33.450 --> 49:36.214
I showed you how to love me right

49:36.287 --> 49:41.987
So comfort me tonight

49:42.059 --> 49:46.462
Come on and comfort me, honey

49:48.399 --> 49:53.837
You know the way, baby

49:53.904 --> 49:56.896
'Cause I showed you right

49:59.410 --> 50:03.710
I want it, I want it

50:03.781 --> 50:07.046
Why don't you

50:09.653 --> 50:13.180
Comfort me?

50:28.572 --> 50:29.903
Floyd!

50:36.513 --> 50:37.673
Yo.

50:37.748 --> 50:39.010
<i>Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson?</i>

50:39.083 --> 50:40.243
No, this is Louis.

50:40.317 --> 50:41.978
Mr. Hinds.

50:42.052 --> 50:43.781
It's Phillip Newman
of FC Management.

50:43.854 --> 50:45.515
How are you, man? I'm a huge fan.

50:45.589 --> 50:47.022
So?

50:47.091 --> 50:49.286
So...

50:49.360 --> 50:53.387
I think I've solved your
cash flow problems, my man.

50:53.464 --> 50:55.932
I've withdrawn $10,000

50:55.999 --> 50:57.489
from my old parents' savings account

50:57.568 --> 50:59.729
to tide you over until
things get sorted out.

50:59.803 --> 51:01.031
Who'd you say you was again?

51:01.105 --> 51:02.197
<i>Phillip.</i>

51:02.272 --> 51:03.796
I wrote you letters
when the man had you

51:03.874 --> 51:05.671
locked down in the pen, you know?

51:05.743 --> 51:08.109
I know you're innocent.
Shit ain't right.

51:09.113 --> 51:12.082
Okay, Phillip, um, look here.

51:12.149 --> 51:13.173
We're on our way to Memphis.

51:13.250 --> 51:15.309
Um, why don't you meet us

51:15.386 --> 51:18.617
at, um, the fountain at Peabody Hotel,

51:18.689 --> 51:20.987
<i>5:00?</i>

51:21.058 --> 51:23.925
Memphis. All right!

51:25.095 --> 51:26.653
I'm hungrier than a mo...

51:26.730 --> 51:29.164
There you are, girl.
You make up your mind?

51:29.233 --> 51:30.723
You want to go to Memphis
with us, or not?

51:30.801 --> 51:32.359
What you gonna do?

51:35.038 --> 51:36.630
What happened?

51:37.641 --> 51:39.973
Nothing. Nothing happened.

51:41.311 --> 51:43.211
Nothing happened.

51:45.215 --> 51:46.546
- No.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

51:46.617 --> 51:48.107
Let him get his whupping.

51:59.129 --> 52:00.619
Why you hit her?

52:00.697 --> 52:04.098
The hell you gonna
do about it, man?

52:04.168 --> 52:05.965
I'm the nigger with the gun, man.

52:06.036 --> 52:07.128
Oh, shit.

52:07.204 --> 52:09.968
Damn! Ugh!

52:10.040 --> 52:11.132
- Aah!
- Come on.

52:11.208 --> 52:14.939
Get your albino
Ike Turner ass up, uh-huh.

52:15.012 --> 52:16.274
Come on.

52:16.346 --> 52:19.440
Aah! Okay! Oh, shit! Aah!

52:19.516 --> 52:21.040
My follicles, man!

52:21.118 --> 52:24.087
Look her in the eye and say
"I'm sorry I hit you,

52:24.154 --> 52:25.644
and I'm never gonna put
my hands on you again. "

52:25.722 --> 52:28.350
- My bad, baby. I ain't...
- Say what I told you to say!

52:28.425 --> 52:30.757
I'm sorry I hit you.
I ain't never gonna do it again.

52:30.828 --> 52:33.388
Now, say you're sorry
for sampling my bass line

52:33.464 --> 52:35.659
and for stomping
on my partner's record.

52:35.732 --> 52:38.326
I'm sorry for sampling your bass line

52:38.402 --> 52:41.064
- and stomping on your Real Deal record.
- Okay.

52:41.138 --> 52:42.969
Now, we taking a road trip,
and we need some gas money.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.803
I ain't got no money, man!

52:44.875 --> 52:47.309
Can you help us?
I saw you out there selling that shit.

52:47.377 --> 52:49.004
It's weed, it ain't crack man!
I ain't got...

52:49.079 --> 52:50.910
- Give me the money!
- Okay, okay.

52:50.981 --> 52:52.243
There's money in my shorts...

52:52.316 --> 52:53.806
Ain't nobody reaching
in your drawers, get it out!

52:53.884 --> 52:55.511
Okay, okay.

52:55.586 --> 52:58.953
I got to reach around my meat, man.

53:00.324 --> 53:02.258
- Here.
- Take it.

53:02.326 --> 53:04.021
Take it.

53:05.062 --> 53:07.223
Oh, damn. My hair hurts.

53:07.297 --> 53:08.889
Take it, man! Aah!

53:08.966 --> 53:09.898
Ow! You're breaking my arm!

53:09.967 --> 53:11.264
Oh, hush.

53:11.335 --> 53:13.360
That's just a little
Chinese submission hold.

53:13.437 --> 53:15.735
This is what it feels like
when I break your arm.

53:17.140 --> 53:19.040
- Shit!
- Break his arm.

53:19.109 --> 53:21.600
Oh, bastard!

53:21.678 --> 53:23.771
I know motherfuckers like you, Lester.

53:23.847 --> 53:26.077
Used to see them
in the yard every day.

53:26.149 --> 53:29.312
You'd better hope
you don't never go inside

53:29.386 --> 53:32.844
because you,
you straight up bitch material.

53:32.923 --> 53:34.322
What about my car, man?

53:34.391 --> 53:35.517
What about your car?

53:35.592 --> 53:37.560
Oh, shit.

53:37.628 --> 53:38.754
I ain't got no clothes on.

53:38.829 --> 53:40.194
This is bullshit.

53:40.264 --> 53:41.993
So what? You run around
with your drawers

53:42.065 --> 53:43.430
hanging off your ass anyway.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.627
I wasn't really gonna shoot you!

53:45.702 --> 53:46.794
Get the fuck out of here.

53:46.870 --> 53:48.861
See, I'm the nigger
with the gun now.

53:48.939 --> 53:50.930
You better hope my arm
don't get better.

53:51.008 --> 53:53.203
I'm gonna learn karate
and kick your ass!

53:53.277 --> 53:54.744
Fuck you!

53:57.180 --> 53:58.613
It was a good thing you stepped in

53:58.682 --> 54:00.240
when you did what you did, partner,

54:00.317 --> 54:01.750
because if I'd have
got a piece of him,

54:01.818 --> 54:04.514
I'd have fucked his shit up
entirely, and you know that.

54:04.588 --> 54:05.850
Come on.

54:05.923 --> 54:07.720
I'm too old to be tussling
with the motherf...

54:07.791 --> 54:09.816
I'd have shot him. I'd have popped...

54:09.893 --> 54:12.418
I'm six, seven years older.
I'd have, like, tussled...

54:15.532 --> 54:16.794
<i>Whoo</i>

54:16.867 --> 54:18.630
<i>Welcome back to the Soul Patrol.</i>

54:18.702 --> 54:19.862

54:36.353 --> 54:39.754
<i>Train number 3 is been gone</i>

54:39.823 --> 54:43.054
How long must I wait for you

54:46.463 --> 54:49.762
<i>It's the Memphis train</i>

54:49.833 --> 54:52.267

54:55.772 --> 54:58.639
<i>How long must I wait for you?</i>

54:58.709 --> 55:01.803
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

55:11.121 --> 55:13.612
Oh, my God.

55:13.690 --> 55:15.453
Mr. Henderson, Mr. Hinds,

55:15.525 --> 55:16.753
let me just start off by saying...

55:16.827 --> 55:18.124
Thank you.

55:22.165 --> 55:23.427
What's up?

55:23.500 --> 55:26.230
Phillip, tonight we're
playing at the House of Soul.

55:26.303 --> 55:27.634
Make sure you be there, baby.

55:27.704 --> 55:30.639
Right on.

55:30.707 --> 55:33.403
Hello. Welcome to the Peabody.
How can I help you?

55:33.477 --> 55:35.911
You can help me by giving me

55:35.979 --> 55:37.640
three of your best
doggone suites, baby.

55:37.714 --> 55:40.649
Well, it'll be my pleasure
to assist you today.

55:40.717 --> 55:41.843
May I see some identification, please?

55:41.918 --> 55:43.078
Okay.

55:43.153 --> 55:44.586
Right there.

55:44.655 --> 55:46.145
Go to hell, Louis.

55:46.223 --> 55:49.192
Mr. Henderson?

55:49.259 --> 55:50.726
It is I.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.093
Will you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

55:59.169 --> 56:00.329
Okay.

56:01.672 --> 56:03.765
Henderson.

56:03.840 --> 56:07.003
Ahh, I-I'm sorry,
Mr. Henderson, Henderson.

56:07.077 --> 56:08.874
We're unable to accommodate you.

56:08.945 --> 56:10.970
Perhaps we could
recommend another hotel.

56:11.048 --> 56:12.640
For what, man? I'm in Memphis.

56:12.716 --> 56:14.047
I want to stay at the Peabody.

56:14.117 --> 56:16.677
Yes, sir, I understand
you've stayed with us before,

56:16.753 --> 56:18.152
and apparently,
that's the problem.

56:18.221 --> 56:20.485
It seems that the last time
you stayed here...

56:20.557 --> 56:23.720
March 12, 1978, to be exact...

56:23.794 --> 56:26.763
you hosted a party,
during which the room

56:26.830 --> 56:28.695
and several other areas of the hotel

56:28.765 --> 56:31.097
- sustained extensive damage.
- Uh-oh.

56:31.168 --> 56:33.329
I don't recollect nothing like that.

56:33.403 --> 56:35.268
I think that's the night
Sly and Bootsy

56:35.338 --> 56:36.896
came by with the fire-eater.

56:36.973 --> 56:39.305
Is that the one with the snake?

56:39.376 --> 56:41.310
- That's the one.
- Hmm.

56:41.378 --> 56:45.041
Perhaps you could put those rooms
in the name of Louis Hinds.

56:45.115 --> 56:46.377
Yeah, perhaps.

56:46.450 --> 56:48.475
Louis Hinds, we'll try that.

56:55.959 --> 56:57.893
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Linda.

56:57.961 --> 56:59.690
What's on there?
Let me see that shit.

56:59.763 --> 57:01.890
I want to see what's on there.

57:01.965 --> 57:04.763
I need four rooms, Don.

57:04.835 --> 57:06.769
Your best available.

57:22.853 --> 57:24.343
Oh, hey, guys.

57:24.421 --> 57:26.514
Your tailor gave me
several choices for tonight.

57:26.590 --> 57:28.558
He said he's going
to stop by around 7:30.

57:28.625 --> 57:29.683
What the fuck?

57:29.760 --> 57:31.455
Did you catch the sale
over at the Build-A-Pimp?

57:31.528 --> 57:33.689
You like that? It's fly, huh?

57:33.764 --> 57:36.392
It's a get-down, get-down.
It's live. It's funky.

57:36.466 --> 57:38.058
And I think I'm going
to get some poonanny.

57:38.135 --> 57:39.625
To be honest with you,

57:39.703 --> 57:42.069
<i>I haven't been laid
since Friends was on television.</i>

57:42.139 --> 57:43.401
So this is my night.

57:43.473 --> 57:46.033
You sure that ain't
one of your children?

57:48.812 --> 57:50.074
You gonna sing real nice tonight.

57:50.147 --> 57:51.307
Who's the girl singer?

57:54.785 --> 57:58.243
Oh, my goodness!
Look at here! Oh, man.

57:58.321 --> 57:59.447
Hello, Louis. Good to see you.

57:59.523 --> 58:00.615
You good, man?

58:07.798 --> 58:08.890
Hey, good-looking.

58:08.965 --> 58:11.456
Claudette.
How you doing, girl?

58:11.535 --> 58:13.093
I know you still ain't upset

58:13.170 --> 58:14.467
about what happened
in Baltimore that...

58:14.538 --> 58:16.563
Oh! What's wrong
with you, woman?

58:16.640 --> 58:19.040
You going straight to hell, Floyd Henderson.

58:20.577 --> 58:21.839
What you laughing at?

58:21.912 --> 58:24.779
- You want some, too?
- No.

58:24.848 --> 58:25.815
Fuck you.

58:25.882 --> 58:27.440
Eee.

58:27.517 --> 58:29.178
Fuck you, fuck you

58:29.252 --> 58:30.913
Now we have no girl singer.

58:30.987 --> 58:32.921
We just got to find
a replacement, that's all.

58:32.989 --> 58:34.149
It's too late.

58:35.192 --> 58:36.454
Cleo.

58:36.526 --> 58:38.323
You know all our songs, right?

58:38.395 --> 58:41.296
Ho ho ho. No offense, man,

58:41.364 --> 58:43.025
but I'm not playing
with no rank amateur.

58:43.099 --> 58:45.431
Come on, Wolfman,
this ain't no rank amateur, man.

58:45.502 --> 58:47.163
This Odetta Whitfield's daughter, man.

58:47.237 --> 58:48.363
Ain't got to recognize.

58:48.438 --> 58:50.929
Shit. Let's roll, then, baby.

58:51.007 --> 58:52.599
Yeah.

58:52.676 --> 58:55.474
She can sing, can't she?

58:57.247 --> 58:58.236
Ow!

59:00.550 --> 59:01.915
Ow!

59:03.720 --> 59:06.587
Oh, oh!

59:08.225 --> 59:09.715
Here we go.

59:09.793 --> 59:12.489
Oh, yeah.

59:15.799 --> 59:19.200
If music makes you move

59:19.269 --> 59:21.635
You can really groove

59:21.705 --> 59:28.174
Groove on

59:28.245 --> 59:31.476
If you feel like
you want to make love

59:31.548 --> 59:34.278
Under the stars above

59:34.351 --> 59:36.285
Love on

59:38.188 --> 59:39.849
Love on

59:41.491 --> 59:43.857
If there's something
that you wanna say

59:43.927 --> 59:46.953
And talking is the hard way

59:47.030 --> 59:53.895
Rap on

59:53.970 --> 59:57.201
'Cause whatever

59:57.274 --> 59:58.969
You want to do

59:59.042 --> 01:00:02.478
- Ow
- You got to do your thing

01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:09.443
If you feel like
you want to scream

01:00:10.687 --> 01:00:12.621
If that's your way you let off steam

01:00:12.689 --> 01:00:14.179
Scream on

01:00:15.859 --> 01:00:18.293
Scream on

01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:22.554
If you feel like you want to sing

01:00:22.632 --> 01:00:25.465
'Cause singing is your thing

01:00:25.535 --> 01:00:27.503
Sing on

01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:32.500
Sing on

01:00:32.575 --> 01:00:35.203
If you want to make love all night

01:00:35.278 --> 01:00:38.975
'Cause you feel it's right

01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:40.880
- Right on
- Oh, yeah, girl.

01:00:40.951 --> 01:00:44.079
Right on

01:00:44.154 --> 01:00:48.090
'Cause whatever

01:00:48.158 --> 01:00:51.093
You want to do

01:00:51.161 --> 01:00:53.152
You got to do your thing

01:01:03.506 --> 01:01:05.667
I'm with the band.
Yeah, it's a dream.

01:01:05.742 --> 01:01:07.733
Yeah, it's a... it's a total dream.

01:01:07.811 --> 01:01:08.903
Yeah.

01:01:08.979 --> 01:01:11.345
I play the harmuffica.

01:01:11.414 --> 01:01:15.510
Wa, wa

01:01:15.585 --> 01:01:16.847
I'll save you a seat.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.151
'Cause whatever

01:01:20.223 --> 01:01:23.420
You want to do

01:01:23.493 --> 01:01:27.862
Yeah, baby, oh

01:01:29.899 --> 01:01:33.596
You got to do your thing

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:35.865
Yeah

01:01:42.078 --> 01:01:44.876
Yeah.

01:01:52.956 --> 01:01:56.483
This is the most insane
night of my life.

01:01:56.559 --> 01:01:58.356
You know Isaac wants
to put me in his studio?

01:01:58.428 --> 01:02:01.761
He says he's got a song
that'd be perfect for me.

01:02:01.831 --> 01:02:03.799
Oh, he does, does he?

01:02:03.867 --> 01:02:07.166
Uh... Come on, now. It ain't like that.

01:02:07.237 --> 01:02:09.000
Oh, it's always like that,

01:02:09.072 --> 01:02:10.562
like movies.

01:02:12.075 --> 01:02:14.509
Well, I'll be careful.

01:02:14.577 --> 01:02:17.307
Just trying to look out
for you, that's all.

01:02:18.314 --> 01:02:22.512
Thanks, guys, for everything.

01:02:24.854 --> 01:02:28.688
You got to do your thing, hey

01:02:28.758 --> 01:02:31.226
See you later.

01:02:37.133 --> 01:02:39.624
If you feel like making love

01:02:39.702 --> 01:02:42.193
'Cause that's your thing

01:02:42.272 --> 01:02:44.968
Right on

01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:47.441
Man, ain't that the Real Deal car?

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:49.637
Sure is, homie. You a fan?

01:02:51.848 --> 01:02:55.249
Hell, yeah. I'm a big fan.

01:02:55.318 --> 01:02:56.842
You know where they at?

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.353
'Cause I need to holler at 'em.

01:02:58.421 --> 01:03:01.857
Actually, I'm their manager.

01:03:01.925 --> 01:03:05.190
Really? Their manager?

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.765
Hold on a minute.

01:03:15.138 --> 01:03:17.163
- Oh, hi, Floyd.
- Hey.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.299
Come on in.
Check this place out.

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:20.603
I could get used to this.

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:22.042
I'll bet you could.

01:03:22.112 --> 01:03:23.272
Let me get you a drink.

01:03:23.346 --> 01:03:24.472
Yeah, I'll take one.

01:03:24.547 --> 01:03:25.809
But hold on, before you do that,

01:03:25.882 --> 01:03:27.474
there's something
I want to say to you.

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:29.450
It's been a blast connecting with you.

01:03:29.519 --> 01:03:30.781
I want you to know that.

01:03:30.854 --> 01:03:32.287
That's sweet of you.

01:03:32.355 --> 01:03:33.617
And if you need anything,

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:34.884
like money or something like that,

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:37.722
don't you hesitate to call me now.

01:03:37.794 --> 01:03:39.853
Not that money gonna make up
for the lost time between us

01:03:39.929 --> 01:03:41.396
or nothing like that.

01:03:41.464 --> 01:03:42.726
Lost time?

01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:43.823
You have to understand,

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.994
Odetta never told me
nothing about you.

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.833
Had I known about you
from the beginning,

01:03:48.905 --> 01:03:50.167
- I'd have been here from the start.
- Whoa, whoa.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.502
- Floyd...
- She never said nothing to me about you.

01:03:51.574 --> 01:03:52.836
You're not my father, Floyd.

01:03:52.909 --> 01:03:54.342
You're not listening.

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:56.002
See, the thing you...
what's that? Say what?

01:03:56.079 --> 01:03:57.637
You're not my father.

01:03:57.714 --> 01:03:59.443
I- I'm not?

01:03:59.516 --> 01:04:00.813
No.

01:04:00.884 --> 01:04:02.476
How do you know?

01:04:02.552 --> 01:04:04.850
Because he knows who I am

01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:06.411
Or he did.

01:04:06.489 --> 01:04:07.751
I mean, for all I know,

01:04:07.824 --> 01:04:09.052
he could be dead.

01:04:10.493 --> 01:04:13.462
I get a little money from him
every once in a while.

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:16.260
It's a blind trust he set up years ago.

01:04:16.332 --> 01:04:18.459
Something to do
with his music royalties.

01:04:18.535 --> 01:04:21.265
Music royalties?

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.037
Oh!

01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:28.009
You knocked up my wife, motherfucker.

01:04:28.077 --> 01:04:31.205
Ooh. You stole her from me first.

01:04:31.281 --> 01:04:33.146
What is wrong with you?

01:04:33.216 --> 01:04:34.740
Whoo!

01:04:34.817 --> 01:04:36.148
You lost your...

01:04:36.219 --> 01:04:37.652
You didn't tell Cleo, did you?

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.153
No, I didn't tell her.

01:04:39.222 --> 01:04:40.553
I should've told her, though.

01:04:40.623 --> 01:04:42.887
I'll bet you laughing
your ass off, wasn't you?

01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:44.426
Going around, talking
about I'm the girl's daddy

01:04:44.494 --> 01:04:47.327
and big round circle of life,
all that bullshit.

01:04:47.397 --> 01:04:48.830
Giggle, giggle, motherfucker.

01:04:48.898 --> 01:04:50.559
Well, just a little bit.

01:04:52.502 --> 01:04:53.833
Floyd...

01:04:53.903 --> 01:04:55.666
Look, Floyd...

01:04:55.738 --> 01:04:56.932
Floyd, put it down. Put it down!

01:04:57.006 --> 01:04:59.600
Dawg, come on!

01:04:59.676 --> 01:05:01.268
You need to quit before you get hurt.

01:05:01.344 --> 01:05:04.336
Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

01:05:04.414 --> 01:05:05.438
Ugh!

01:05:05.515 --> 01:05:06.948
Look, Floyd,

01:05:07.016 --> 01:05:08.950
I didn't mean for it
to happen, all right?

01:05:09.018 --> 01:05:10.315
You know how she was.

01:05:10.386 --> 01:05:13.716
Come here.

01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.348
Come on, man. Stop acting a fool.

01:05:16.759 --> 01:05:17.817
You all right?

01:05:17.894 --> 01:05:19.828
Aw, shit. Quit acting a fool!

01:05:22.665 --> 01:05:26.226
Fucking dad!

01:05:26.302 --> 01:05:28.862
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:05:49.659 --> 01:05:53.257
Time out.

01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:55.923
Oh.

01:05:57.133 --> 01:05:59.465
Still got a little pop
in your punch there, partner.

01:05:59.535 --> 01:06:01.662
Pop this, motherfucker!

01:06:01.738 --> 01:06:03.501
Oh!

01:06:03.573 --> 01:06:04.904
Ooh.

01:06:04.974 --> 01:06:06.908
Shit. Ugh.

01:06:06.976 --> 01:06:08.238
You dirty motherfucker,

01:06:08.311 --> 01:06:10.211
hitting me in the nuts.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.578
Ooh! Shit.

01:06:12.649 --> 01:06:16.517
Louis, you just can't
keep whooping on my ass.

01:06:16.586 --> 01:06:18.679
I'm a motherfucking man, baby.

01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:20.279
I'm a motherfucking man.

01:06:23.393 --> 01:06:26.487
Louis, how come you won't
see your own daughter?

01:06:26.562 --> 01:06:28.553
Oh, motherfucker,
I wanted to see her,

01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:31.122
but, you know...

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.101
It's time... After a while,

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:37.196
you know, it's just...
it's just too much.

01:06:37.273 --> 01:06:39.036
Why didn't O tell her?

01:06:39.108 --> 01:06:40.700
Why didn't Odetta tell her, man?

01:06:40.777 --> 01:06:42.711
What was she going to tell her, huh?

01:06:42.779 --> 01:06:46.476
That her daddy was
a alcoholic dopehead convict

01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:48.881
that fucked up everything
he touched, hmm?

01:06:48.951 --> 01:06:50.043
No, no.

01:06:50.119 --> 01:06:51.950
She was better off without me.

01:06:52.021 --> 01:06:53.488
Oh, shit.

01:06:53.556 --> 01:06:54.614
Anyhow, it's too late now.

01:06:54.691 --> 01:06:55.715
Uh-uh.

01:06:55.792 --> 01:06:58.283
It was a mistake
getting to know her.

01:06:58.361 --> 01:07:00.022
- Lou...
- What?

01:07:00.096 --> 01:07:01.461
What is wrong with you?
You having a seizure?

01:07:01.531 --> 01:07:03.829
What? What?

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.663
Oh.

01:07:05.735 --> 01:07:07.669
Oh. Cleo.

01:07:07.737 --> 01:07:09.534
- Cleo, wait. Ow!
- Excuse me.

01:07:09.605 --> 01:07:11.573
God damn it. Wait!

01:07:11.641 --> 01:07:13.131
Let me talk to... ow!

01:07:13.209 --> 01:07:14.506
Move, God damn it!

01:07:14.577 --> 01:07:16.204
Come here, Cleo!

01:07:16.279 --> 01:07:18.144
Call the police.

01:07:20.283 --> 01:07:21.477
Hey, yo, white boy.

01:07:21.551 --> 01:07:23.576
You really
in the music business?

01:07:23.653 --> 01:07:24.745
Why, do you have a mix tape?

01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:26.311
Shut the fuck up, white boy!

01:07:26.389 --> 01:07:28.721
And stop sweating
so goddamn much.

01:07:28.791 --> 01:07:30.315
You smell like bacon.

01:07:30.393 --> 01:07:32.327
And I'm a Muslim on Saturdays.

01:07:32.395 --> 01:07:34.386
Fucking wrong with you, huh?

01:07:34.464 --> 01:07:36.591
How you white and got a afro?

01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:38.691
That ain't cool.

01:07:38.768 --> 01:07:40.030
Damn, my head hurt!

01:07:40.103 --> 01:07:42.435
Hey, there go Cleo.
There go Cleo.

01:07:42.505 --> 01:07:44.302
Taxi.

01:07:44.374 --> 01:07:45.898
There go my baby, right there.

01:07:45.975 --> 01:07:47.408
Where she going?

01:07:47.477 --> 01:07:48.739
Where to, honey?

01:07:48.811 --> 01:07:50.108
Cleo!

01:07:50.179 --> 01:07:51.441
Oh, hell, yeah.

01:07:51.514 --> 01:07:54.950
There go that old
Snoop Dogg-looking motherfucker.

01:07:55.017 --> 01:07:56.075
Real Deal,

01:07:56.152 --> 01:07:58.620
they fitting to be real dead!

01:07:58.688 --> 01:08:00.315
I'm coming for you, old man!

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.483
Hey, yo, Les, let them old
motherfuckers have it, man.

01:08:02.558 --> 01:08:03.889
- I'm going for it.
- Go for it, nigger.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.019
Get them motherfuckers.

01:08:06.095 --> 01:08:07.790
Hey, hey, hey.

01:08:07.864 --> 01:08:10.025
Come on, now. You know
I'm the only who drive the Mothership, man.

01:08:10.099 --> 01:08:11.566
Watch this shit with Lester

01:08:11.634 --> 01:08:12.896
about to kill
on these motherfuckers.

01:08:12.969 --> 01:08:14.561
That's how we live,
we do it like that.

01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:17.837
Louis!

01:08:17.907 --> 01:08:19.932
I'm back!

01:08:20.009 --> 01:08:22.203
Gun!

01:08:22.278 --> 01:08:23.370
Yeah!

01:08:26.948 --> 01:08:30.112
Oh, shit! Motherfucking
Lester got fucked up!

01:08:30.185 --> 01:08:31.243
God damn!

01:08:32.921 --> 01:08:34.856
I'm out of this motherfucker...

01:08:34.924 --> 01:08:36.185
- What about Lester, man?
- Fuck Lester.

01:08:36.259 --> 01:08:38.955
Yeah, fuck Lester!

01:08:39.028 --> 01:08:42.589
You don't even know Lester, man.

01:08:45.468 --> 01:08:47.060
Why you run over me, man!

01:08:47.136 --> 01:08:51.129
You old dirty bastard!

01:08:52.642 --> 01:08:55.475
Old Jim Brown, Fred Williamson,

01:08:55.545 --> 01:08:58.207
two-the-hard-way motherfuckers!

01:08:58.281 --> 01:09:00.408
I'll kill you, I swear...

01:09:00.483 --> 01:09:03.008
Aah! Shit!

01:09:03.085 --> 01:09:06.577
Let me kill you one time at least, man!

01:09:06.656 --> 01:09:08.020
You done fucked up the Mothership.

01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:09.216
I ought to stab you in your throat.

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:10.417
Fuck you! Aah!

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:12.256
You hear that?

01:09:12.328 --> 01:09:14.694
Shoot that motherfucker, Louis.

01:09:17.332 --> 01:09:19.062
Get your hands up!

01:09:19.135 --> 01:09:21.933
I can't, nigger. My arm's in a brace.

01:09:22.004 --> 01:09:24.768
Drop the weapon now!
Come on!

01:09:30.412 --> 01:09:32.176
This is my first time ever being in here.

01:09:32.247 --> 01:09:33.647
Quiet, please.

01:09:39.589 --> 01:09:41.318
This filthy-ass motherfucking place,

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:42.948
man, got me itching.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.591
Yo, turnkey!

01:09:46.662 --> 01:09:48.357
Come on and let me out
of this motherfucker!

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:50.694
You might want to wrap
your mind around the fact

01:09:50.765 --> 01:09:51.892
that we're gonna miss that show.

01:09:51.968 --> 01:09:53.697
Fuck you talking about, man?

01:09:53.769 --> 01:09:56.397
We gotta be in New York
tomorrow night.

01:09:56.472 --> 01:09:58.235
Uh-uh. Not me.

01:09:58.307 --> 01:09:59.535
I've had enough. I'm done.

01:09:59.609 --> 01:10:01.634
What, you're walking
out on me, Louis?

01:10:01.711 --> 01:10:04.009
Look, Floyd,
I was doing just fine

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.377
before you showed up at my door.

01:10:05.448 --> 01:10:06.745
That's the thanks I get

01:10:06.816 --> 01:10:08.283
for pulling you out
of that fucking rat hole.

01:10:08.351 --> 01:10:09.613
You was just sitting up in there,

01:10:09.685 --> 01:10:10.879
just sitting there waiting to die.

01:10:10.953 --> 01:10:12.079
Negro, please.

01:10:12.154 --> 01:10:13.746
You ain't no different from me,

01:10:13.823 --> 01:10:16.451
Especially since your nephew
put your senile ass out to pasture

01:10:16.526 --> 01:10:17.686
and stole your business.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.591
Fuck you, Louis.

01:10:19.662 --> 01:10:22.722
Crawl back under that damn rock
you've been living.

01:10:22.798 --> 01:10:24.322
I don't need you.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.425
I'll do this shit by my damn self.

01:10:26.502 --> 01:10:29.994
Yo! Turnkey!

01:10:30.072 --> 01:10:31.835
Come on and let me
out of this motherfucker.

01:10:31.908 --> 01:10:33.671
I've had enough, man.
I want my lawyer.

01:10:33.743 --> 01:10:34.767
Relax, relax.

01:10:34.844 --> 01:10:36.778
You ain't gonna need no lawyer.

01:10:36.846 --> 01:10:38.973
Witnesses say
your story checks out,

01:10:39.048 --> 01:10:41.778
so you, sir, are good to go.

01:10:42.818 --> 01:10:45.252
Yeah.

01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:47.789
Whoa. Hold on there, Chuck Berry.

01:10:47.857 --> 01:10:50.087
You're gonna need a lawyer.

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:53.890
Seems crossing state lines
is in violation of his parole,

01:10:53.963 --> 01:10:55.931
Not to mention
possession of firearms

01:10:55.998 --> 01:10:57.295
and driving without a license.

01:10:57.366 --> 01:10:58.424
No license?

01:10:59.669 --> 01:11:00.931
Step back for a minute.

01:11:02.705 --> 01:11:05.105
I hope your ass rot up in here,

01:11:05.174 --> 01:11:07.142
you criminal-bound
motherfucker, you.

01:11:07.209 --> 01:11:12.374
As Lao-Tzu says,
"Let things flow forward as they may. "

01:11:12.448 --> 01:11:14.780
And I'm gonna let it flow, too, baby.

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:19.048
And I got some Blackanese
philosophical shit for your ass, pal.

01:11:19.121 --> 01:11:21.612
You get by, Lou,
but you don't get away.

01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:23.955
You sit in shit,
you start to smell like it,

01:11:24.026 --> 01:11:25.584
so check the crack of your ass.

01:11:25.661 --> 01:11:27.822
Here's something else for you.

01:11:27.897 --> 01:11:30.024
Here go her number.

01:11:31.067 --> 01:11:33.592
Call her... Daddy.

01:11:35.271 --> 01:11:36.499
Fuck him, man!

01:11:36.572 --> 01:11:38.335
Let's get on
out of this motherfucker.

01:11:38.407 --> 01:11:40.739
He ain't worth
two damn flies smashed.

01:11:43.045 --> 01:11:44.137
Nigger.

01:11:51.587 --> 01:11:52.679
Hmph!

01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:03.130
Hey. Yo!

01:12:05.968 --> 01:12:07.902
Can I make a phone call?

01:12:23.653 --> 01:12:25.848
<i>You walking out on me, Louis?</i>

01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:27.286
<i>I've had enough. I'm done.</i>

01:12:27.356 --> 01:12:28.823
<i>You all right, man?</i>

01:12:28.891 --> 01:12:30.381
<i>Um, yeah, yeah. I'm all right.</i>

01:12:30.459 --> 01:12:32.017
<i>You're not all right.
You can't hardly breathe.</i>

01:12:32.094 --> 01:12:33.994
<i>You need a chest X-ray.</i>

01:12:34.063 --> 01:12:36.258
<i>I ain't trying to make no comeback.</i>

01:12:36.332 --> 01:12:37.924
<i>I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.</i>

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.297
<i>That's the thanks I get</i>

01:12:39.368 --> 01:12:40.630
<i>for pulling you out of that rat hole,</i>

01:12:40.703 --> 01:12:41.829
<i>just sitting there waiting to die...</i>

01:12:41.904 --> 01:12:43.496
<i>sitting there waiting to die...</i>

01:12:43.572 --> 01:12:45.130
<i>- die, die...
- It's too late.</i>

01:12:45.207 --> 01:12:46.868
<i>Is there a doctor in the house?</i>

01:12:48.878 --> 01:12:51.244
<i>Keep it short.</i>

01:12:51.313 --> 01:12:52.746
<i>- Hey...
- Hello.</i>

01:12:52.815 --> 01:12:55.545
<i>It's Cleo. Please leave a message.</i>

01:12:58.688 --> 01:13:03.022
Cleo... um, this is, uh, Louis.

01:13:03.092 --> 01:13:04.992
Louis Hinds.

01:13:05.061 --> 01:13:06.426
Your father.

01:13:07.697 --> 01:13:10.564
Wow, um,
feels funny saying that.

01:13:10.633 --> 01:13:12.794
I've, um, I've never said it before.

01:13:12.868 --> 01:13:14.597
Um...

01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:16.137
Listen.

01:13:18.174 --> 01:13:20.369
I didn't mean what I said.

01:13:20.443 --> 01:13:21.808
I was...

01:13:24.814 --> 01:13:28.250
Odetta was the love of my life.

01:13:28.317 --> 01:13:30.114
The worst thing
that ever happened to me

01:13:30.186 --> 01:13:33.917
was losing her and you.

01:13:33.989 --> 01:13:35.320
But you turned out great.

01:13:35.391 --> 01:13:38.656
She did a wonderful job with you.

01:13:38.728 --> 01:13:41.492
You know your mother
was an amazing woman.

01:13:41.564 --> 01:13:43.088
And I just want you to know

01:13:43.165 --> 01:13:48.228
I'm really, really glad I met you.

01:13:48.304 --> 01:13:49.396
And I wish I...

01:13:54.877 --> 01:13:56.037
Yo.

01:13:59.582 --> 01:14:00.981
All right.

01:14:09.492 --> 01:14:12.222
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

01:14:12.294 --> 01:14:13.226
Hmm?

01:14:13.295 --> 01:14:14.785
Busting your ass out of jail.

01:14:14.864 --> 01:14:17.094
What the fuck does it
look like I'm doing?

01:14:17.166 --> 01:14:18.497
Back up, Red. Get your keys out.

01:14:18.567 --> 01:14:19.556
Open that cell, okay?

01:14:19.635 --> 01:14:20.761
Deputy, don't listen to him.

01:14:20.836 --> 01:14:23.202
He will not shoot you.
Not on purpose anyway.

01:14:23.272 --> 01:14:25.740
Don't let him get you fucked up, Red.

01:14:25.808 --> 01:14:27.241
I'll kill you disco-dead.

01:14:27.309 --> 01:14:29.539
Now open that doggone cell, man.

01:14:29.612 --> 01:14:31.842
Stop shaking. If you shake,
I'm gonna start shaking.

01:14:31.914 --> 01:14:33.211
Next thing you know, kapow!

01:14:33.282 --> 01:14:34.510
Go on in.

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:35.641
Now hand him the keys.

01:14:35.718 --> 01:14:37.413
Hand them to him.

01:14:37.486 --> 01:14:38.919
- Okay?
- Floyd.

01:14:38.988 --> 01:14:40.649
You sure you want to do this?

01:14:40.723 --> 01:14:43.191
Does everything gotta be
a fucking argument with you?

01:14:43.259 --> 01:14:44.624
God damn! Come on out of there!

01:14:44.693 --> 01:14:46.593
Close the door, Lou. Lock it up.

01:14:46.662 --> 01:14:48.994
I'm a hostage.

01:14:49.064 --> 01:14:50.463
You're gonna be a dead hostage

01:14:50.533 --> 01:14:51.659
if you don't shut the fuck up.

01:14:53.169 --> 01:14:54.830
Now look here, Red.

01:14:54.904 --> 01:14:56.462
I like you, almost.

01:14:56.539 --> 01:14:59.440
You call anybody outside
your mama, kapow.

01:14:59.508 --> 01:15:00.998
Okay?

01:15:01.844 --> 01:15:03.175
Let's get out of here.

01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:07.046
Anybody following us, man?

01:15:07.116 --> 01:15:08.174
Not yet.

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:10.684
But you can bet your ass they will be.

01:15:10.753 --> 01:15:11.947
Lou, we gotta dump
the Mothership, man.

01:15:12.021 --> 01:15:13.181
We gotta dump it.

01:15:13.255 --> 01:15:14.722
You'd abandon the Mothership?

01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:16.155
We're fugitives from the law.

01:15:16.225 --> 01:15:18.159
We gotta start thinking like it.

01:15:18.227 --> 01:15:20.525
We're not fugitives, O.J.

01:15:20.596 --> 01:15:22.860
You're a fugitive. I'm a hostage.

01:15:22.932 --> 01:15:24.729
That's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

01:15:29.572 --> 01:15:30.630
Wait, wait, wait.

01:15:30.706 --> 01:15:32.230
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

01:15:32.308 --> 01:15:34.333
Look at that right there, man.

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:36.674
Ain't that Lester's car?

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:38.679
Motherfuckers.

01:15:43.719 --> 01:15:47.416
We're hungry, man. Come up with some
baked chicken or something.

01:15:53.395 --> 01:15:54.362
They're at it again.

01:15:58.601 --> 01:16:01.092
Oh, shit! Lester's car!

01:16:11.146 --> 01:16:13.046
- You hear that?
- What?

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:16.342
That.

01:16:16.418 --> 01:16:20.582
Oh, my God!
Oh, God, no! Oh, God...

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:23.951
Mr. Hinds. Mr. Henderson.

01:16:24.026 --> 01:16:25.186
It's so good to see you.

01:16:25.261 --> 01:16:26.728
Oh, my God.

01:16:26.795 --> 01:16:30.231
Oh, it was so hot in there.
You have no idea.

01:16:30.299 --> 01:16:32.290
If there's anything
I can get you,

01:16:32.368 --> 01:16:34.427
like a latte, I'm here for you guys.

01:16:34.503 --> 01:16:35.834
But first I really have to pee,

01:16:35.905 --> 01:16:37.270
so I'm just gonna hop on out.

01:16:37.339 --> 01:16:39.239
If you could give me
a hand out of here.

01:16:39.308 --> 01:16:40.468
I've been locked in there,

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:42.339
and they've had the woofers going all day.

01:16:42.411 --> 01:16:43.969
Oh, my God.

01:16:44.046 --> 01:16:46.412
I just have to pee real bad,
so if you don't mind.

01:16:46.482 --> 01:16:47.540
It's so good to see you.

01:16:47.616 --> 01:16:49.447
Oh, Mr. Hinds...

01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:58.991
Ahh...

01:17:01.964 --> 01:17:03.192
<i>The body of Marcus Hooks</i>

Uh, that's my other line.

01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:40.592
I'll call you back. This is Danny.

01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:41.761
Hello, Mr. Epstein.

01:17:41.837 --> 01:17:44.499
<i>Phillip Newman.
I broke your stapler last week.</i>

01:17:44.573 --> 01:17:45.972
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- Hello?</i>

01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:47.269
Where the hell are you?

01:17:47.343 --> 01:17:49.140
Listen, I called
because I just wanted to let you know

01:17:49.211 --> 01:17:51.679
that everything's cool,
and we're still on target.

01:17:51.747 --> 01:17:52.975
We?

01:17:53.048 --> 01:17:54.709
You're with Henderson and Hinds?

01:17:54.783 --> 01:17:55.807
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:17:55.884 --> 01:17:57.374
They say "motherfucker" a lot,

01:17:57.453 --> 01:17:58.715
but they're really good guys.

01:17:58.787 --> 01:18:00.277
All right, well, good.

01:18:00.356 --> 01:18:01.687
You can give them this message.

01:18:01.757 --> 01:18:03.486
The network just called,
and they're off the show.

01:18:03.559 --> 01:18:05.186
But they can't do that!

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.989
Oh, really? It's VH1.

01:18:07.062 --> 01:18:08.495
<i>Have you seen Flava of Love?</i>

01:18:08.564 --> 01:18:10.464
They can pretty much do
whatever they want.

01:18:10.532 --> 01:18:12.727
And another thing, you're fired.

01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:15.827
Motherfucker! What the fuck?

01:18:24.513 --> 01:18:25.343
What'd he say?

01:18:26.782 --> 01:18:29.512
Uh, he said I'm fired,

01:18:29.585 --> 01:18:34.045
and... and, uh,
and you're off the show.

01:18:41.063 --> 01:18:42.792
Are... Are you serious, man?

01:18:44.133 --> 01:18:45.725
I'm so sorry.

01:19:02.951 --> 01:19:06.011
Nnn! Nnn! Nnn!

01:19:30.012 --> 01:19:32.640
You know, uh,
according to the map,

01:19:32.714 --> 01:19:35.911
that road leads to the turnpike.

01:19:35.984 --> 01:19:37.611
I think we've still got time to make it.

01:19:37.686 --> 01:19:40.246
Make what, Louis?

01:19:40.322 --> 01:19:42.187
You heard what the motherfucker said!

01:19:42.257 --> 01:19:43.315
It's over!

01:19:43.392 --> 01:19:44.825
Fuck that.

01:19:48.964 --> 01:19:53.264
This shit ain't over till we
say it's over, all right?

01:19:55.537 --> 01:19:56.936
Things have changed,

01:19:57.005 --> 01:20:01.066
and I have achieved
a state of mental clarity.

01:20:01.143 --> 01:20:02.371
Ain't that a bitch?

01:20:02.444 --> 01:20:03.672
You hear what this motherfucker said?

01:20:03.745 --> 01:20:06.543
Ever since I knocked
on your door, man,

01:20:06.615 --> 01:20:08.810
you've been beating my balls
at every fucking turn.

01:20:08.884 --> 01:20:12.547
Now all of a sudden, you've
got a state of clarity.

01:20:12.621 --> 01:20:14.350
Where was your clarity in L.A., Lou?

01:20:14.423 --> 01:20:15.913
You can't just dial that shit up

01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:18.255
like you calling for a pizza, motherfucker.

01:20:18.327 --> 01:20:21.160
You got to go inside, do the work.

01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:23.824
Consequently,
I have a confession.

01:20:25.267 --> 01:20:29.601
Floyd, you were right about me.

01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:33.664
I have given up on a lot
of things in my life.

01:20:33.742 --> 01:20:36.210
But I ain't giving up on this. All right?

01:20:36.278 --> 01:20:40.078
Come on, man, we've been through
enough shit the last few days.

01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:41.548
We can do this.

01:20:41.617 --> 01:20:44.347
And I dare anybody
to try to stop us.

01:20:44.419 --> 01:20:46.387
Let's go, motherfucker.

01:20:46.455 --> 01:20:47.581
Shotgun.

01:20:48.924 --> 01:20:50.448
Get your ass in the backseat.

01:20:50.692 --> 01:20:53.525
<i>Ain't no stoppin' us now</i>

01:20:53.595 --> 01:20:55.392
<i>We're on the move</i>

01:20:59.201 --> 01:21:02.637
<i>There's been so many
things that's held us down</i>

01:21:02.704 --> 01:21:04.535
<i>But now it looks</i>

01:21:04.606 --> 01:21:07.439
<i>Like things are finally coming around</i>

01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:12.746
<i>Don't you let nothing, nothing</i>

01:21:12.814 --> 01:21:16.807
<i>Stand in your way</i>

01:21:16.885 --> 01:21:20.685
<i>I want y'all to listen, listen</i>

01:21:20.756 --> 01:21:24.283
<i>To every word I say,
every word I say</i>

01:21:24.359 --> 01:21:26.827
<i>Ain't no stopping us now</i>

01:21:26.895 --> 01:21:28.260
<i>No, no, no</i>

01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:29.797
<i>We're on the move</i>

01:21:29.865 --> 01:21:33.130
<i>The movin' groovin'</i>

01:21:33.202 --> 01:21:35.568
<i>Ain't no stopping us now</i>

01:21:35.637 --> 01:21:37.571
Full sound and switch on all
the floor monitors, all right?

01:21:37.639 --> 01:21:39.800
Look at that.
That's nice and subtle.

01:21:39.875 --> 01:21:41.001
I'm on it, then. Sound check.

01:21:41.076 --> 01:21:42.043
Okay. Thanks.

01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:43.042
- Mr. Epstein.
- Yeah?

01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:44.408
Hey, thank God you're here.

01:21:44.479 --> 01:21:45.639
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

01:21:45.714 --> 01:21:47.545
What are you doing here?
I thought I fired you.

01:21:47.616 --> 01:21:49.777
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not alone.

01:21:56.024 --> 01:21:57.389
You guys are insane!

01:21:57.459 --> 01:21:59.086
Good to see you, too, Little Ep.

01:21:59.161 --> 01:22:01.254
Yeah, this is never going to happen.

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:04.026
You'll be arrested
the moment the cops spot you.

01:22:04.099 --> 01:22:05.896
We don't care anything about that.

01:22:05.968 --> 01:22:07.902
We just want to do our song.

01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:10.200
Oh, one other thing.
You got a few minutes?

01:22:10.272 --> 01:22:11.739
Yeah, I got all the time
in the world.

01:22:11.807 --> 01:22:13.434
I'm just producing a television show

01:22:13.508 --> 01:22:15.135
with dozens of huge musical acts

01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:17.337
that goes live in 171/2 minutes,

01:22:17.412 --> 01:22:19.346
but you know, let's grab some coffee
and have a little chit-chat.

01:22:25.087 --> 01:22:27.453
Wow. How long's he got?

01:22:29.324 --> 01:22:30.416
We don't know.

01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:33.450
All right.

01:22:33.528 --> 01:22:35.587
I'll see what I can do. Okay?

01:22:35.664 --> 01:22:37.256
Thank you.

01:22:40.535 --> 01:22:43.595
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and
gentlemen,</i>

01:22:43.672 --> 01:22:45.663
<i>please take your seats.</i>

01:22:45.741 --> 01:22:48.005
<i>The ceremony will begin shortly.</i>

01:22:52.714 --> 01:22:54.181
I'll get it.

01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.512
Wow!

01:22:59.588 --> 01:23:01.055
The Black Moses.

01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:03.157
How's it going, man?

01:23:03.225 --> 01:23:04.317
Hey, what's happening?

01:23:04.393 --> 01:23:05.325
What's up, baby?

01:23:05.394 --> 01:23:06.326
Hey, fellas.

01:23:06.395 --> 01:23:07.726
Hey, what's happening?

01:23:07.796 --> 01:23:09.229
- The man.
- My man.

01:23:09.298 --> 01:23:10.424
Okay, all right.

01:23:10.499 --> 01:23:12.694
Heard you were here.
Just wanted to wish you luck.

01:23:13.835 --> 01:23:14.824
Oh, by the way,

01:23:14.903 --> 01:23:16.495
brought somebody by to see you.

01:23:16.571 --> 01:23:17.629
Oh, is that right?

01:23:17.706 --> 01:23:19.003
Yeah.

01:23:26.748 --> 01:23:28.306
Okay, everybody,
let's move on out of here.

01:23:28.383 --> 01:23:29.611
Come on.

01:23:29.685 --> 01:23:31.550
All right, you heard what Mr. Henderson said.

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:32.552
After you, young man.

01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:34.350
Okay.

01:23:53.942 --> 01:23:57.002
I'm sorry I ran out the way I did.

01:23:58.213 --> 01:24:00.545
I'm the one who ran out.

01:24:00.615 --> 01:24:02.742
There's no need for you to apologize.

01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:10.487
Can I help you with your tie?

01:24:10.559 --> 01:24:11.856
Yeah, sure.

01:24:11.927 --> 01:24:13.952
You know what you're doing?

01:24:14.029 --> 01:24:15.860
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

01:24:17.399 --> 01:24:19.026
Here you go.

01:24:21.136 --> 01:24:22.967
Mm! Ohh!

01:24:24.606 --> 01:24:25.834
You all right?

01:24:25.907 --> 01:24:27.704
Yeah. Just some water, please.

01:24:27.776 --> 01:24:28.743
Damn!

01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:30.107
All cameras are on point.

01:24:30.178 --> 01:24:31.372
We just added two mics.

01:24:31.446 --> 01:24:33.107
Mr. Epstein!
You better come quick.

01:24:33.181 --> 01:24:34.773
Come on, I'm serious.
Come on! It's important!

01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:36.010
All right. Take care of those.

01:24:36.084 --> 01:24:37.108
15 minutes, Danny.

01:24:39.955 --> 01:24:41.047
He just collapsed.

01:24:41.123 --> 01:24:42.852
I think he's in a lot of pain.

01:24:42.924 --> 01:24:44.391
Open your hand.
Open your hand.

01:24:44.459 --> 01:24:45.517
Right there, right there.

01:24:45.594 --> 01:24:47.960
Okay, okay.

01:24:49.131 --> 01:24:51.463
Be strong, brother.
Hang on in there.

01:24:51.533 --> 01:24:53.398
It ain't time for you to check out now.

01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:54.730
Check out? What?

01:24:54.803 --> 01:24:57.135
Come on, man.
Everybody knows, man.

01:24:57.205 --> 01:24:59.537
My aunt was taking the same
doggone pills, man.

01:24:59.608 --> 01:25:02.270
Took her about a week
before she wasted away to nothing,

01:25:02.344 --> 01:25:03.538
just kicking and screaming.

01:25:03.612 --> 01:25:04.977
I don't know what killed her ass,

01:25:05.046 --> 01:25:08.345
but if she was taking those,
she had a bladder infection.

01:25:08.417 --> 01:25:09.543
Say what?

01:25:09.618 --> 01:25:12.781
Look, Doctor Dumbshit,
I got a kidney stone.

01:25:12.854 --> 01:25:14.344
Hurts like a motherfucker
when I pee,

01:25:14.423 --> 01:25:15.685
but it ain't gonna kill me.

01:25:15.757 --> 01:25:16.951
So you're not dying?

01:25:17.025 --> 01:25:20.392
From the first slap and cry,
we all start to die.

01:25:20.462 --> 01:25:23.124
But I ain't on no accelerated program,
hell, no.

01:25:23.198 --> 01:25:25.393
Ain't that about a bitch?

01:25:25.467 --> 01:25:28.334
All that damn hard work,
busting your ass out of jail,

01:25:28.403 --> 01:25:29.563
and you ain't even dying.

01:25:29.638 --> 01:25:31.003
I was kinda looking forward
to seeing you go.

01:25:31.072 --> 01:25:33.267
Excuse me, Danny.
They're on in two.

01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:34.933
All right. Where we at, guys?

01:25:36.144 --> 01:25:37.839
Okay, I'm good.

01:25:41.249 --> 01:25:43.308
The Apollo, the mecca.

01:25:43.385 --> 01:25:44.784
This brings back memories, man.

01:25:44.853 --> 01:25:46.480
How many times you think
we've performed here?

01:25:46.555 --> 01:25:47.749
Ooh, uh...

01:25:47.823 --> 01:25:49.120
ooh, five-oh.

01:25:49.191 --> 01:25:50.158
50, really?

01:25:50.225 --> 01:25:51.590
- Five-oh.
- Oh!

01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.820
Come on. Move, move.

01:25:52.894 --> 01:25:54.657
That's them! Hold it! Hold it!

01:25:54.729 --> 01:25:56.993
<i>All units report, all units report.</i>

01:25:57.065 --> 01:25:58.464
<i>Suspects have been spotted.</i>

01:25:58.533 --> 01:26:01.502
<i>All units, apprehend them quietly
and by the book.</i>

01:26:02.871 --> 01:26:04.839
Hey, Lou, do you think
they're gone, man?

01:26:04.906 --> 01:26:06.430
I don't have X-ray vision, motherfucker!

01:26:06.508 --> 01:26:07.532
How would I know?

01:26:07.609 --> 01:26:09.839
Lower your voice, Lou.
Doggone it, man.

01:26:09.911 --> 01:26:11.742
It's so dark in here you can't see shit.

01:26:11.813 --> 01:26:13.041
Hold up.

01:26:13.114 --> 01:26:14.547
Let me see if I can reach my lighter.

01:26:14.616 --> 01:26:15.742
Don't light no lighter
up in here, man.

01:26:15.817 --> 01:26:17.307
We'll blow up like a barbecue.

01:26:17.385 --> 01:26:18.977
Hold on one minute.

01:26:19.054 --> 01:26:20.749
Shit.

01:26:24.493 --> 01:26:27.519
Marcus motherfucking Hooks.

01:26:27.596 --> 01:26:29.996
Long way from Linwood Street, huh,
motherfucker?

01:26:30.065 --> 01:26:32.397
Fuck Linwood Street and him.

01:26:32.467 --> 01:26:34.401
He used both of us, and you know it.

01:26:34.469 --> 01:26:37.063
Come on, man. He just thought
he'd be a bigger star going solo.

01:26:37.138 --> 01:26:38.127
He was right.

01:26:38.206 --> 01:26:39.468
No he wasn't.

01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:41.202
He didn't want to split
the money three ways.

01:26:41.276 --> 01:26:42.402
Just look at him, sitting there

01:26:42.477 --> 01:26:44.536
with that old shit-eating
grin on his face.

01:26:44.613 --> 01:26:47.104
You think you're all that, motherfucker,
don't you?

01:26:47.182 --> 01:26:49.013
I have to admit, every time
I think about you,

01:26:49.084 --> 01:26:51.348
I could just choke the shit out of you!

01:26:51.419 --> 01:26:52.545
Stop it, stop it!

01:26:52.621 --> 01:26:54.452
Floyd, he ain't
thinking shit. He's dead.

01:26:57.092 --> 01:27:00.152
Say, ain't that my watch?

01:27:00.228 --> 01:27:02.219
See? You thought
I stole that mother...

01:27:02.297 --> 01:27:04.322
I told you this motherfucker
was a klepto!

01:27:04.399 --> 01:27:05.764
Shit, look at that.

01:27:05.834 --> 01:27:07.199
That's nice.

01:27:07.269 --> 01:27:08.361
Probably stole that, too.

01:27:08.436 --> 01:27:10.700
Motherfucker always had
good taste, though.

01:27:10.772 --> 01:27:12.103
I'm gonna keep this.

01:27:16.745 --> 01:27:18.576
Hey, Louis.

01:27:18.647 --> 01:27:20.842
You think if, you know...

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:22.884
if he wouldn't have, you know, died,

01:27:22.951 --> 01:27:24.248
you think we would have
got back together?

01:27:24.319 --> 01:27:25.911
Oh, hell, no.

01:27:25.987 --> 01:27:27.818
But you know what?

01:27:27.889 --> 01:27:28.947
We are together,

01:27:29.024 --> 01:27:31.083
and I've been thinking
about our little arrangement.

01:27:31.159 --> 01:27:32.148
I'm gonna go ahead

01:27:32.227 --> 01:27:35.355
and break you off 50/50, all right?

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:37.022
Wow, Lou, that's...

01:27:37.098 --> 01:27:39.760
that's real black of you, man.

01:27:39.834 --> 01:27:41.461
Because there ain't no money.

01:27:41.536 --> 01:27:42.560
Say what?

01:27:42.637 --> 01:27:44.605
Well, you said it yourself.

01:27:44.673 --> 01:27:45.662
It's a funeral.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.900
Nobody pays you to sing, man.

01:27:46.975 --> 01:27:48.374
You lied about the money?

01:27:48.443 --> 01:27:50.377
- Yeah.
- You motherfucker.

01:27:50.445 --> 01:27:52.310
Hey, you can't say
it wasn't worth it.

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.245
Well, I could say it.

01:27:56.117 --> 01:27:57.914
But I'd be lying.

01:27:57.986 --> 01:27:59.647
I love you, Lou.

01:27:59.721 --> 01:28:01.814
My nigger.

01:28:01.890 --> 01:28:03.915
But this motherfucker,
you know, I can't help it.

01:28:03.992 --> 01:28:06.085
Every time,
I could just kill this motherfucker!

01:28:06.161 --> 01:28:08.129
That's why he left, because
you was always picking on him.

01:28:08.196 --> 01:28:09.254
Stop fucking with him.

01:28:09.331 --> 01:28:11.231
He fucked with my happiness.

01:28:20.141 --> 01:28:21.870
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:28:21.943 --> 01:28:24.411
I'm Isaac Hayes.

01:28:26.247 --> 01:28:28.238
Where the fuck are they, Danny?

01:28:28.316 --> 01:28:31.342
My good friends, please join me

01:28:31.419 --> 01:28:35.185
in saying farewell
to brother Marcus Hooks.

01:28:41.196 --> 01:28:42.561
It's Louis and Floyd!

01:28:42.631 --> 01:28:43.757
It's the Real Deal!

01:28:43.832 --> 01:28:46.824
Oh!

01:28:46.901 --> 01:28:49.699
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal,

01:28:49.771 --> 01:28:51.500
back together again.

01:28:51.573 --> 01:28:54.502
Give them a hand.

01:28:54.576 --> 01:28:57.477
Reunited, y'all.

01:28:57.545 --> 01:28:58.944
They got their shit together.

01:28:59.014 --> 01:29:01.847
Yes! Let's go!

01:29:01.916 --> 01:29:03.747
Stand by.
Move in on my command.

01:29:03.818 --> 01:29:05.285
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:29:05.353 --> 01:29:07.014
Come on, Officer
detective person.

01:29:07.088 --> 01:29:08.350
Please, just, you know, come on.

01:29:08.423 --> 01:29:10.288
Let them sing one song.
One little song.

01:29:10.358 --> 01:29:12.019
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

01:29:12.093 --> 01:29:13.720
The Real Deal!

01:29:15.997 --> 01:29:19.057
All right. One song.

01:29:19.134 --> 01:29:21.034
But it better be good.

01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:25.062
One song. The good one.

01:29:29.678 --> 01:29:30.804
How's that hip?

01:29:30.879 --> 01:29:31.971
Locked and loaded, baby.

01:29:32.047 --> 01:29:33.309
Let's do this.

01:29:34.749 --> 01:29:36.444
Band!

01:29:36.518 --> 01:29:38.509
Let's take a walk in the park.

01:29:38.586 --> 01:29:40.884
1, 2, 3, 4!

01:29:52.434 --> 01:29:54.595
Oh, yeah

01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:57.035
When the river gets to rollin'

01:29:57.105 --> 01:30:00.734
And then you add
a bowlful of soul in

01:30:00.809 --> 01:30:04.074
And then I tried
to let it all go then

01:30:04.145 --> 01:30:05.806
Oh, yeah

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.007
Oh, it's easy to me

01:30:08.083 --> 01:30:11.450
You see, the way
I ride the rhythm

01:30:11.519 --> 01:30:15.080
You see, the truth
is all I can give 'em

01:30:15.156 --> 01:30:17.852
And the lyrics can
come from livin'

01:30:17.926 --> 01:30:21.623
Oh, yeah, oh, it's easy to me

01:30:21.696 --> 01:30:23.391
Oh, yeah

01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:27.424
Music comes out of my heart

01:30:27.502 --> 01:30:31.461
Something like a walking the park

01:30:31.539 --> 01:30:34.599
It's just a walk in the park

01:30:34.676 --> 01:30:36.473
Oh, yeah

01:30:36.544 --> 01:30:39.274
And no one else in here, I heard it

01:30:39.347 --> 01:30:42.976
I don't know what I've
done to deserve it

01:30:43.051 --> 01:30:46.646
You don't question it
while you serve it

01:30:46.721 --> 01:30:47.983
Oh, yeah

01:30:48.056 --> 01:30:50.047
Oh, it was given to me

01:30:50.125 --> 01:30:53.652
I got something you inherit

01:30:53.728 --> 01:30:56.754
I don't know that you
was born to share it

01:30:56.831 --> 01:31:00.767
And if you shoot,
be sure you wear it

01:31:00.835 --> 01:31:02.769
Oh, yeah

01:31:02.837 --> 01:31:04.168
Oh, it comes naturally to me

01:31:04.239 --> 01:31:06.469
Uh-huh-uh

01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:08.634
Music comes out of my heart

01:31:08.710 --> 01:31:10.177
Yeah

01:31:10.245 --> 01:31:13.840
Something like a walk in the park

01:31:13.915 --> 01:31:15.906
It's just a walk in the park

01:31:15.984 --> 01:31:18.849
Oh, yeah

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:21.650
Oh, yeah!

01:31:21.723 --> 01:31:23.782
Y'all having a good time
out here tonight?

01:31:23.858 --> 01:31:25.883
This is what I'm talking about!

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.121
You know about that
walk in the park, man?

01:31:28.196 --> 01:31:29.686
Sure I know about
that walk in the park.

01:31:29.764 --> 01:31:31.254
You do? I'll tell you what.

01:31:31.332 --> 01:31:33.095
- Show them.
- Got to get down.

01:31:40.909 --> 01:31:42.103
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:31:42.177 --> 01:31:44.168
let's give a big Apollo welcome

01:31:44.245 --> 01:31:46.145
to the stage for the first time,

01:31:46.214 --> 01:31:50.344
my daughter, Miss Cleo Whitfield!

01:31:50.418 --> 01:31:54.013
To make something out of nothin'

01:31:54.088 --> 01:31:57.524
That's what we all
got in common

01:31:57.592 --> 01:32:01.119
So just hold on tight, I'm comin'

01:32:01.196 --> 01:32:03.130
Oh, yeah, yeah

01:32:03.198 --> 01:32:04.631
Said to me

01:32:04.699 --> 01:32:07.862
I'll give you something
you can believe in

01:32:07.936 --> 01:32:11.702
And then enjoy yourself
this evenin'

01:32:11.773 --> 01:32:15.004
And don't you dare
think about leavin'

01:32:15.076 --> 01:32:16.873
Oh, yeah

01:32:16.945 --> 01:32:20.779
Sing along with me

01:32:20.849 --> 01:32:24.376
Music comes out of my heart

01:32:24.452 --> 01:32:26.852
Something like a walk
in the park

01:32:26.921 --> 01:32:30.181
It's just a walk in the park

01:32:30.258 --> 01:32:31.850
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

01:32:31.926 --> 01:32:33.518
Oh, yeah

01:32:35.029 --> 01:32:37.862
Music comes out of my heart

01:32:37.932 --> 01:32:42.301
Something like a walk
in the park

01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:45.168
It's just a walk in the park

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:47.504
Oh, yeah

01:32:49.277 --> 01:32:51.973
Music comes out of my heart

01:32:52.046 --> 01:32:53.479
One song.

01:32:53.548 --> 01:32:55.641
Something like a walk in the park

01:32:55.717 --> 01:32:57.014
A walk in the park

01:32:57.085 --> 01:32:59.053
It's just a walk in the park

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.382
A walk in the park

01:33:00.455 --> 01:33:02.423
Oh, yeah

01:33:02.490 --> 01:33:05.015
Music comes out of my heart

01:33:05.093 --> 01:33:07.152
I'm their manager!

01:33:07.228 --> 01:33:09.321
Something like a walk in the park

01:33:09.397 --> 01:33:11.160
Walk in the park

01:33:11.232 --> 01:33:12.426
It's just a walk in the park

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:18.564
Just like a walk in the park

01:33:20.808 --> 01:33:24.039
Oh, yeah

01:33:38.459 --> 01:33:39.721
Whoo!

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.403
<i>Yeah, ooh, yeah</i>

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.128
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo

01:34:14.195 --> 01:34:15.253
Haah

01:34:15.330 --> 01:34:17.025
You're gonna sing real nice tonight.

01:34:19.133 --> 01:34:20.191
<i>All right, y'all.</i>

01:34:20.268 --> 01:34:22.964
<i>Got that funky time</i>

01:34:23.037 --> 01:34:31.642
<i>I can feel it</i>

01:34:33.281 --> 01:34:35.647
Any time the camera
or the mic comes on,

01:34:35.717 --> 01:34:37.150
I don't cheat myself.

01:34:37.218 --> 01:34:39.618
That was rule number 1
I was taught as a kid.

01:34:39.687 --> 01:34:41.484
And I definitely can't
cheat the audience.

01:34:41.556 --> 01:34:43.353
So I give 150%% %

01:34:43.424 --> 01:34:46.518
every single time that I do anything.

01:34:46.594 --> 01:34:48.357
Even the way I live my life.

01:34:48.429 --> 01:34:51.296
I just cherish
each doggone moment.

01:34:51.366 --> 01:34:53.891
A black preacher's
something else, ain't it?

01:34:53.968 --> 01:34:56.994
You can't pay your rent
after you come from church.

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.974
And if you ask the preacher
for the $5.00,

01:35:01.042 --> 01:35:04.034
he'll be like, "Fuck you
in the name of Jesus. "

01:35:04.112 --> 01:35:06.876
My comedy is not fictitious.

01:35:06.948 --> 01:35:10.213
My comedy has
to come from my heart.

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:15.616
- Charlie Chan was a hell of a man.
- All right, let's rehearse.

01:35:15.690 --> 01:35:18.215
He went through China
with his shit in his hand.

01:35:18.292 --> 01:35:20.783
Had five women against the wall.

01:35:20.862 --> 01:35:23.592
I betcha five dollars
that he fucked them all.

01:35:23.664 --> 01:35:24.961
He fucked them hard.

01:35:25.033 --> 01:35:26.159
He fucked them long.

01:35:26.234 --> 01:35:28.794
He fucked them till his shit got sore.

01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:31.338
He went to the doctor,
and the doctor said,

01:35:31.406 --> 01:35:33.738
"Sorry, Charlie, your dick is dead. "

01:35:33.808 --> 01:35:36.641
He said, "Doctor, Doctor,
that can't be true. "

01:35:36.711 --> 01:35:39.339
"Yes, sir, Charlie,
your balls are too!"

01:35:41.182 --> 01:35:42.945
I've been performing all my life.

01:35:43.017 --> 01:35:44.678
So being in front of an audience

01:35:44.752 --> 01:35:46.379
has never been a problem for me.

01:35:46.454 --> 01:35:48.285
It's time to go?

01:35:49.223 --> 01:35:50.588
Well, go on, then.

01:35:53.494 --> 01:35:56.258
You want to leave a lasting impression
on your audience.

01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:58.890
You know, and that's something
I was taught, too,

01:35:58.966 --> 01:36:00.263
when I first started.

01:36:00.334 --> 01:36:01.562
Always make them remember you,

01:36:01.636 --> 01:36:04.434
or remember something
about you and the film.

01:36:04.505 --> 01:36:08.134
I'm going back to my
$600-a-night hotel room,

01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:13.146
have me a nice-ass, uh,
piece of pussy and shit.

01:36:13.214 --> 01:36:14.272
Okay?

01:36:14.348 --> 01:36:16.407
Cut it.

01:36:18.186 --> 01:36:19.278
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.

01:36:19.353 --> 01:36:21.378
I'm not even in yet.

01:36:21.456 --> 01:36:25.592
I got to boogie for you

01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:27.924
I got nothin' but boogie

01:36:27.995 --> 01:36:30.293
Nothin' but boogie for you

01:36:30.364 --> 01:36:32.264
I got nothin' but boogie

01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:33.960
Nothin' but boogie for you

01:36:34.035 --> 01:36:41.574
Boogie, boogie

01:36:44.745 --> 01:36:47.475
I want to say thanks to you all

01:36:47.548 --> 01:36:51.279
because you all made me... yeah.

01:36:55.456 --> 01:36:58.254
I wouldn't have
no TV show or movies.

01:36:58.326 --> 01:37:00.191
You all was coming to see me,

01:37:00.261 --> 01:37:01.922
and you all made me...

01:37:01.996 --> 01:37:04.931
Chattanooga, Louisiana, Mississippi.

01:37:06.134 --> 01:37:08.125
So thank you.

01:37:08.202 --> 01:37:10.762
I think if I had a few free passes

01:37:10.838 --> 01:37:12.135
like a lot of people,

01:37:12.206 --> 01:37:14.697
I don't think I would be
as successful as I have.

01:37:14.775 --> 01:37:16.436
My task here on Earth

01:37:16.511 --> 01:37:19.639
is I have to work harder
than the average bear.

01:37:19.714 --> 01:37:20.646
It look easy, don't it?

01:37:20.715 --> 01:37:23.513
But it's not.

01:37:23.584 --> 01:37:26.109
Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you.

01:37:30.158 --> 01:37:34.822
<i>I never can say goodbye</i>

01:37:34.896 --> 01:37:37.228
<i>No, no, no, I</i>

01:37:37.298 --> 01:37:40.859
<i>I never can say goodbye</i>

01:37:40.935 --> 01:37:42.869
<i>No, no, no,</i>

<i>Even though the pain
and heartaches</i>

01:37:46.474 --> 01:37:49.739
<i>Seem to follow me wherever I go</i>

01:37:49.810 --> 01:37:53.769
<i>Though I try and try
to hide my feelings</i>

01:37:53.848 --> 01:37:56.544
<i>They always seem to show</i>

01:37:56.617 --> 01:38:00.246
<i>Then you try to say
you're leaving me</i>

01:38:00.321 --> 01:38:03.722
<i>And I always have to say no</i>

01:38:03.791 --> 01:38:06.589
<i>Tell me why</i>

01:38:06.661 --> 01:38:09.255

<i>Soon are gonna all work out</i>

01:38:30.918 --> 01:38:34.046
<i>But there's that same unhappy feeling</i>

01:38:34.121 --> 01:38:37.613
<i>That makes that anguish
twist that doubt</i>

01:38:37.692 --> 01:38:41.093
<i>It's that same old dizzy hangup</i>

01:38:41.162 --> 01:38:44.825
<i>Can't live with you or without</i>

01:38:44.899 --> 01:38:47.766
<i>Tell me why</i>

01:38:47.835 --> 01:38:50.099

<i>I won't try</i>

01:39:07.188 --> 01:39:09.053
<i>I won't let you go</i>

01:39:18.132 --> 01:39:19.064
