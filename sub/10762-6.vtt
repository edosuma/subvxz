WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:10.076
Here we are.

00:10.076 --> 00:13.079
File A, slide sheet one,
image one

00:13.079 --> 00:15.081
of subject
Frederick G. Crane.

00:15.081 --> 00:16.082
Mom...

00:16.583 --> 00:18.918
Here you are just
an hour after being

00:19.219 --> 00:21.788
wrestled from
my grudging womb.

00:21.788 --> 00:22.789
Gross.

00:22.789 --> 00:24.791
You know, if you like

00:24.791 --> 00:26.793
there's still time
to include this

00:27.293 --> 00:29.062
in your Bar Mitzvah video.
Thanks.

00:29.262 --> 00:31.331
But I just want to get
through this thing

00:31.331 --> 00:32.631
with as little
humiliation as possible.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.000
Oh, look at this.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.502
Your hospital cap.

00:35.502 --> 00:39.506
The very combed cotton
that swaddled your little...

00:39.506 --> 00:42.442
(voice breaking):
...head.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.244
Are you okay?

00:44.544 --> 00:46.112
Of course I am.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.114
It's only natural that
there should be

00:48.548 --> 00:51.117
some emotional upheaval caused
by the impending shift

00:51.618 --> 00:52.619
in our relationship.

00:52.619 --> 00:53.620
I knew it would come--

00:53.620 --> 00:57.123
I just wasn't expecting
such a roller coaster.

00:57.123 --> 00:58.324
All done.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.661
Is this your guest list?

01:01.661 --> 01:03.163
Oh, I didn't realize

01:03.163 --> 01:05.165
you wanted to invite
so many friends.

01:05.165 --> 01:08.968
I don't even know
some of these people.

01:08.968 --> 01:10.837
And why are you inviting
Jeremy Berman?

01:10.837 --> 01:13.640
I thought you told me he's the biggest nerd in your class.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.475
He's not so bad.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.477
Besides, the more people you invite

01:17.477 --> 01:19.479
the more presents you get.

01:19.479 --> 01:20.413
Frederick...

01:20.413 --> 01:22.348
A Bar Mitzvah is
a rite of passage,

01:22.348 --> 01:25.251
not an opportunity
for you to collect presents.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.687
I'm sorry. You're right.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.557
I'll try to trim it down.

01:30.824 --> 01:31.858
KENNY:
Hey, Doc.

01:31.858 --> 01:32.692
Kenny.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.527
I can't tell you
how touched I am

01:34.527 --> 01:36.463
that Freddie invited me
to his Bar Mitzvah.

01:36.863 --> 01:37.897
He did?
Yeah.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.365
What a great kid.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.367
That's your son, right?

01:41.367 --> 01:42.268
Yes.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.070
I wasn't aware that you two had met.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.405
We haven't.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.907
I guess he's probably heard
his share of Kenny stories.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.242
(chuckling)

01:49.509 --> 01:51.544
From whom?

01:51.978 --> 01:53.546
You sly kidder.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.549
It sounds like a hoot,
but if I don't find someone

01:56.549 --> 01:59.052
to drive with me to Boston
and share a tent on the way

01:59.052 --> 02:00.553
I probably won't
be able to afford to go.

02:00.987 --> 02:02.422
Hmm.

02:02.689 --> 02:04.157
Fun drive, I bet.

02:04.491 --> 02:05.492
Hmm.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.227
I guess I can just
send him something.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.062
I think he'd like that.
Thanks, Kenny.

02:10.062 --> 02:13.066
Hey, Dr. Crane,
Mazel Tov.

02:19.706 --> 02:20.707
Hey, Frasier.
Hi, Roz.

02:20.707 --> 02:21.708
Freddie's so sweet.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.577
He sent me an invitation
to his Bar Mitzvah.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.312
Yes.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.248
apparently the people
of Washington State

02:28.248 --> 02:31.084
have made
quite an impression on him.

02:31.351 --> 02:34.888
Can you believe Freddie
is 13 years old already?

02:35.255 --> 02:38.825
I can hardly think about it
without choking up.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.227
This is my son, Roz.

02:41.594 --> 02:45.131
The little bald candy man
that used to fit right here

02:45.131 --> 02:46.636
in the crook of my arm

02:47.367 --> 02:50.436
Little bald candy man.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.438
That's adorable.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.941
I had a boyfriend
who called hi...

03:02.949 --> 03:04.450
Is it weird to have a son

03:04.450 --> 03:07.754
brought up in a different
religion from yours?

03:07.954 --> 03:10.523
Not at all, Roz.
It's a faith that espouses

03:10.523 --> 03:13.526
love, compassion, duty,
education and art.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.894
All values which I cherish.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.797
And though I have played
a relatively small role

03:17.797 --> 03:20.266
in his spiritual developme
nt, he has honored me

03:20.700 --> 03:22.602
by asking that I say
a few words.

03:22.869 --> 03:23.937
And in the spirit
of the occasion

03:23.937 --> 03:25.371
I'm going to try
to learn it in Hebrew.

03:25.738 --> 03:26.806
Oh...
Hi, Dr. Crane.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.808
Hi, No
Hi, Roz.

03:29.242 --> 03:32.645
You've never worn that sweater
on a Tuesday before.

03:32.946 --> 03:36.015
I've asked you to take your hands
out of your pockets

03:36.516 --> 03:37.450
when you talk to me.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.325
So, I don't think I can make the Bar Mitzvah.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.626
Great.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.562
I mean that sarcastically,
of course, Noel.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.498
Great! You're not coming! Terrific!

03:52.932 --> 03:55.501
Yeah, sorry. Did I
overhear you say you
want to learn Hebrew?

03:55.501 --> 03:56.436
...
Uh

03:56.803 --> 03:57.870
Not learn it.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.373
I'm saving that pleasure
for retirement.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.342
But I have composed a speech

04:02.342 --> 04:04.310
and I'd like to say it
in Hebrew.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.146
Well, I can translate and teach
you how to say it if you want.

04:07.513 --> 04:08.581
You can? Really?

04:08.581 --> 04:10.049
Oh, Noel, thank you.

04:10.416 --> 04:14.254
Of course, I'll expect a little
something quid pro quo.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.055
Certainly.
Whatever you'd like.
Great.

04:16.488 --> 04:19.058
The Seattle Star Trek
convention is this weekend

04:19.058 --> 04:22.060
and all the Enterprise captains
are making an appearance.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.964
I need Scott Bakula's autograph
to make my collection complete.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.200
Noel, isn'’t this something you could do yourself?

04:27.467 --> 04:29.535
Oh, I would, but
William Shatner's

04:29.535 --> 04:32.839
restraining order against me
is still in effect.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.041
It's so stupid.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.911
It wasn't even a real phaser

04:39.312 --> 04:40.880
Noel, don't you have any friends

04:40.880 --> 04:42.382
that could
do this for you?

04:42.782 --> 04:44.350
Trust me, there are no friends

04:44.851 --> 04:47.120
in the world
of Star Trek autography.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.888
I see.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.890
Well then, consider it done.

04:50.890 --> 04:51.724
Oh!

04:51.958 --> 04:54.427
Thank you
so much. Now...

04:54.727 --> 04:57.764
be sure to keep it
in this acid-free covering

04:57.764 --> 04:59.232
until the actual signing.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.467
And if you must handle it,

05:01.701 --> 05:04.237
use these cotton gloves.

05:05.738 --> 05:06.739
Okay.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.641
You'll be the hit
of the Bar Mitzvah,

05:09.008 --> 05:10.076
I promise.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.078
And don't be surprised
if you get caught up

05:12.078 --> 05:13.913
in all the fun
of the convention, too.

05:14.213 --> 05:16.282
I'll try to pace myself.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.751
Thanks again,
Dr. Crane.

05:18.751 --> 05:19.652
Noel..

05:19.986 --> 05:21.387
how did you know I would do it?

05:21.688 --> 05:22.588
What do you mean?

05:22.855 --> 05:24.924
Well, you must have known
I would do this for you,

05:24.924 --> 05:26.426
or you wouldn't be
carrying around

05:26.426 --> 05:27.760
a picture of Scott Bakula,
right?

05:28.027 --> 05:29.595
Right.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.737
Hey, Niles, think fast

05:38.237 --> 05:38.971
(flashbulb pops)

05:38.971 --> 05:40.773
Oh!

05:40.773 --> 05:42.709
Dad!

05:43.042 --> 05:44.110
What is that?

05:44.544 --> 05:47.914
My good old Scheerblad-7XK.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.249
The blindingest, noisiest,
15-pound camera

05:50.249 --> 05:52.719
every produced
in the former Soviet Union.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.454
MARTIN:
Can you believe it?!

05:54.687 --> 05:56.622
Somehow it got buried
deep down in storage.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.257
But Eddie and
I found it

05:58.458 --> 06:00.526
just in time
for the Bar Mitzvah.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.528
What smells like
burning plastic?

06:02.528 --> 06:04.931
Oh, that means
the flash unit's working

06:05.264 --> 06:06.833
I thought
the retinue-scorching flash

06:07.333 --> 06:08.801
meant that the flash unit
was working.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.536
Not always.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.573
I still remember the night
of my junior prom.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.842
Ooh... Dad wanted to get
a nice close-up

06:15.842 --> 06:17.810
of me and Margaret Coover.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.246
Unfortunately, he got
a little too close and the

06:20.580 --> 06:22.148
heat from the flash
seared the gold plating

06:22.648 --> 06:25.485
off Margaret's necklace
onto her skin.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.820
You never mentioned
Margaret Coover before.

06:27.820 --> 06:28.654
I didn't?

06:28.654 --> 06:29.989
Margaret Coover.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.959
Petite, brunette...
gilded.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.330
(flashbulb pops)

06:42.835 --> 06:45.405
Dear God,
the old flash-and-wind.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.339
NILES: Yes.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.807
Dad found it.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.308
Yeah, good thing, too.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.043
Hasn't failed me yet.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.845
Oh, well, except for that one
Thanksgiving

06:53.346 --> 06:55.348
when the flash washed Lilith out
so bad

06:55.348 --> 06:57.683
all you could see
were her hair and eyes.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.952
That wasn't the camera's
fault, Dad.

07:00.319 --> 07:04.290
That bloodless skin has
confounded even the most
experienced photographer.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.192
Hey, Daph, do you know
where the tripod is?

07:06.192 --> 07:07.527
I might need it
for group shots.

07:07.827 --> 07:09.395
Yeah, I think it's in
the back of your closet.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.364
Come on, I'll help
you look for it.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.272
Sherry, Frasier?
Please, Niles.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.139
I have good news.

07:20.473 --> 07:21.541
Hmm?
I have two tickets

07:21.974 --> 07:24.043
to the Udo Fritzenheim show
at the museum tomorrow.

07:24.477 --> 07:25.478
(gasps)
Not to mention

07:25.812 --> 07:28.381
an invitation for lunch
with the artist afterwards.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.315
Oh!

07:29.649 --> 07:31.217
Are you serious?!

07:31.217 --> 07:33.719
Niles, lunch
with a Dada master.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.721
Oh, I'd love to come...

07:35.721 --> 07:36.556
but I can't.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.191
I have other plans.

07:38.491 --> 07:41.561
m,
I promised Noel Shempsky
that I'd do a favor for him

07:41.561 --> 07:43.563
and I've got to remain
true to my word.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.065
Although, perhaps,
I could go to the show

07:46.065 --> 07:49.435
leave the luncheon early and...
and still fulfill my commitment.

07:49.735 --> 07:50.736
Oh, yes, of course you could.

07:50.736 --> 07:51.737
Yeah, you're
right, Niles.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.239
There...

07:54.774 --> 07:56.709
You know...

07:57.009 --> 07:59.579
it was at a Fritzenheim show
in Boston

08:00.079 --> 08:03.082
where Freddie first said
the word "Dada."

08:03.516 --> 08:05.585
I remember swelling
with pride

08:05.585 --> 08:08.588
thinking that perhaps
he was an art history savant.

08:08.588 --> 08:11.557
But, of course, Lilith
deflated my enthusiasm

08:11.557 --> 08:14.727
by pointing out that he was
probably just referring to me.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.264
Fras, good news--
found the tripod.

08:18.698 --> 08:22.168
Oh. Splendid.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.504
It's tough to watch your kids grow up.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.940
Well, he's... he's
still just a boy.

08:27.940 --> 08:28.941
He's only 13.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.444
It goes fast.

08:33.946 --> 08:34.947
How's Lilith taking it?

08:35.448 --> 08:36.448
Well, I

08:36.448 --> 08:39.519
suppose it's a bittersweet experience for her.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.520
I can't really say for sure,
you know.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.523
She's always been rather guard
ed with her emotions.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.024
Not always, Frasier.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.926
I've seen her get
quite emotional.

08:48.794 --> 08:51.297
I'm sure you have,
Mr. Been-There-Done-That.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.436
What does that mean?

08:59.872 --> 09:03.309
Nothing.
Nothing.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.178
What are you hiding?

09:06.178 --> 09:07.680
Oh...

09:11.684 --> 09:14.687
Um... some years ago..

09:17.657 --> 09:20.192
In a complete drunken stupor.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.627
Totally stinko.

09:21.627 --> 09:22.495
NILES:
Yes.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.298
I had an unplanned

09:25.631 --> 09:30.703
and instantly regretted night
ofamore...

09:33.706 --> 09:35.007
...with Lilith.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.742
A one-nighter?

09:37.109 --> 09:38.578
Ofamore.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.315
Lilith?

09:42.815 --> 09:44.317
Well, it w...
it was after Maris

09:44.317 --> 09:45.818
And it was long before you.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.320
In fact, it's pretty funny

09:47.320 --> 09:48.688
when you think about it.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.357
(nervous laughter)

09:51.624 --> 09:52.625
And remember, I was drunk.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.595
You'd have to be,
wouldn't you?

09:55.595 --> 09:56.996
Sorry, Frasier.

09:57.296 --> 10:01.300
No, no, drinking definitely
took the edge off.

10:03.803 --> 10:04.870
Um, when were you planning

10:05.371 --> 10:08.207
on sharing this interesting bit
of information with me?

10:08.474 --> 10:09.542
Soon.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.043
Very soon.

10:11.043 --> 10:13.312
Never.

10:14.580 --> 10:18.084
Well, what's
done is done.

10:18.084 --> 10:21.487
I suppose we've all had
our romantic missteps.

10:21.821 --> 10:22.888
But just to be clear--

10:22.888 --> 10:24.890
are there any more
secret sweethearts

10:24.890 --> 10:26.726
who I see on a regular basis?

10:27.026 --> 10:28.594
No. Nobody.

10:28.594 --> 10:29.595
Nobody?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.999
Nobody

10:33.399 --> 10:34.967
I certainly wouldn't count Anamari Hanratty

10:35.468 --> 10:38.037
at the Natural History Museum.

10:38.537 --> 10:39.805
Frasier?!

10:40.039 --> 10:42.608
I said I wouldn't count her.

10:43.109 --> 10:45.578
I mean... they just made out.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.883
It was for charity.

10:50.883 --> 10:51.884
It doesn't really matter.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.387
I mean, the woman
makes out with everyone.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.922
She's not really the kind
of person that you'd...

10:56.922 --> 10:58.791
(yelling)

11:05.264 --> 11:05.765
Hi, Dr. Crane.

11:06.265 --> 11:07.266
Oh, hi, Noel.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.268
Ready for Yeshiva tomorrow?
That means school.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.302
Yes, indeed I am.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.871
I'm looking forward to it.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.440
Uh, listen, Noel,
I'm afraid I have some, uh..

11:14.440 --> 11:17.777
very bad news about
the science fiction convention.

11:18.044 --> 11:18.611
Uh-oh.

11:19.111 --> 11:19.945
Long story short,

11:20.246 --> 11:21.313
you see, I attended an art opening

11:21.313 --> 11:22.815
and a luncheon on Saturday

11:22.815 --> 11:24.316
and even though I left the luncheon early

11:24.316 --> 11:26.719
the traffic on the way to
the convention was just awful

11:27.053 --> 11:28.120
and by the time I got there

11:28.621 --> 11:30.523
Mr. Bakula and all the others
had gone.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.426
No...!

11:33.426 --> 11:36.929
You made a promise
and you welshed on it.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.432
Why'd you do it, Dr. Crane?

11:39.865 --> 11:42.368
It's not really such a big deal,
is it, Noel?

11:42.735 --> 11:43.803
It's a huge deal.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.806
Who knows when I'll get to see Scott Bakula again?

11:46.806 --> 11:48.774
I'll be the laughing stock of my clan.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.544
Noel, try to rem...clan?

11:51.777 --> 11:55.114
No, never mind,
never mind. Noel..

11:55.314 --> 11:59.685
surely you realize that
Star Trek is just a TV show.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.488
So was Brideshead Revisited.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.491
You're angry.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.760
So I'm going to ignore that

12:07.993 --> 12:10.529
But with all due respect, Noel,

12:10.930 --> 12:14.500
perhaps weaning yourself
off science fiction

12:14.500 --> 12:18.504
might be the first step
toward achieving a genuine,

12:18.504 --> 12:21.373
meaningful, grown-up person's life.

12:23.142 --> 12:25.678
Just a friendly suggestion.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.646
You're right.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.950
You did your best
and that's good enough for me.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.319
Thank you, Noel.

12:33.819 --> 12:36.322
So, you'll still be my tutor?

12:36.322 --> 12:37.323
Sure.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.824
Good man.
Thanks, Noel.

12:38.824 --> 12:39.825
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.931
Oh, yes, you will
see me tomorrow.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.934
And by the rings
of Septaurus Five

12:48.934 --> 12:51.737
you will pay, Dr. Crane.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.507
You-- Oh, hi, Kenny--

12:54.507 --> 12:56.008
will pay.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.648
Okay, Eddie,
hit the talk button.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.786
And you're listening
to the Best of Crane on KACL.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.788
We'll be back
after these messages.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.624
(station ID theme music plays)
(door opens)

13:11.957 --> 13:16.028
Well, well, the fox and the hound working together.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.029
How ironic

13:17.530 --> 13:18.531
I'm just taking care of him

13:18.531 --> 13:20.032
until Frasier gets back
from Boston.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.468
By the way,
he left you something.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.536
He did?

13:23.536 --> 13:24.503
Yeah.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.446
Whoa. A wig?

13:34.713 --> 13:37.283
That's cruel,
even for Frasier.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.220
Cruel? It's only the wig Joan Collins wore

13:41.720 --> 13:42.721
in Star Trek 28.

13:42.721 --> 13:45.124
"City on the Edge of Forever."

13:45.491 --> 13:48.561
It's probably still got her DNA in it.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.530
"Dear Noel, I hope
this begins to repay you

13:51.530 --> 13:54.033
"for your great kindness to me,

13:54.033 --> 13:56.535
"especially in light
of my negligence.

13:56.535 --> 13:58.304
Your friend, Frasier Crane."

13:58.504 --> 14:02.041
He called me "friend"?

14:02.041 --> 14:04.009
That's really sweet of him

14:04.009 --> 14:07.012
I've got to call him
before he delivers his speech.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.350
You taught him dirty words
in Hebrew, didn't you?

14:11.350 --> 14:12.852
Uh, not quite.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.188
They're the same words,
but they're in Klingon.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.557
From Star Trek?

14:18.557 --> 14:20.559
That's not even real.

14:20.559 --> 14:23.562
It's the fastest-growi
ng language on the planet.

14:23.562 --> 14:26.632
This is what you people don't understand.

14:26.632 --> 14:30.035
A man named Gene Roddenberry
had a vision...

14:30.035 --> 14:31.537
Call him!

Yasher Koach,Frederick

14:52.558 --> 14:54.560
That was a beautiful passage

14:54.560 --> 14:55.995
and a wonderful reading.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.364
You honor us all by including..

14:58.364 --> 14:59.765
(cell phone rings)

15:00.132 --> 15:02.201
Oh.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.407
You honor us all

15:08.407 --> 15:11.410
by including us in
this important occasion,

15:11.911 --> 15:15.381
but you have chosen to especially honor your parents

15:15.748 --> 15:16.815
Lilith and Frasier

15:16.815 --> 15:19.151
by asking them
to conclude this ceremony.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.486
Lilith?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.794
Thank you. Uh...
(flashbulb pops)

15:33.399 --> 15:35.401
Excuse me.
Would the photographer

15:35.834 --> 15:37.903
please refrain from
taking any more pictures

15:38.404 --> 15:40.406
until after the ceremony is over?

15:40.406 --> 15:42.341
MARTIN:
Sorry, Rabbi.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.743
LILITH:
Thank you.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.246
I am very proud to participate

15:47.246 --> 15:49.248
in the coming-of-age ritual

15:49.248 --> 15:52.251
of my son Frederic
k Gaylord Crane.

15:52.751 --> 15:53.686
(snickering)

15:54.253 --> 15:55.621
Oh.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.493
Frederick, on this momentous occasion

16:01.493 --> 16:03.495
I can only look at you

16:03.495 --> 16:08.000
and see that innocent, chubby-legged toddler

16:08.000 --> 16:12.004
who once danced naked at the Boston Pops

16:12.004 --> 16:16.909
The little boy whose
favorite meal was
"buh-sghetti."

16:17.276 --> 16:19.311
I can't count the number of bedtimes

16:19.745 --> 16:24.083
we spent cuddled together
reading The Cat in the Hat.

16:25.884 --> 16:29.888
"The sun did not shine,
it was too wet to play,

16:30.222 --> 16:32.558
"so we sat in the house

16:32.758 --> 16:36.829
"
on that cold,
cold, wet day.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.831
(crying)

16:38.831 --> 16:40.332
Don'’’t grow up!

16:40.332 --> 16:41.200
Not yet!

16:41.467 --> 16:43.535
Nice girlfriend
you've got there.

16:44.903 --> 16:47.339
Not yet! Not yet!

16:47.806 --> 16:49.875
If you're trying to embarrass me

16:49.875 --> 16:51.343
it's not going to work.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.879
(choked up):
Come here, Daddy's little peanut man.

16:58.017 --> 16:58.917
It'll be all right.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.320
We will conclude with a blessing

17:01.820 --> 17:03.789
from Frederick's father Frasier,

17:04.189 --> 17:05.190
who, though not of our faith,

17:05.190 --> 17:07.693
has chosen to follow
his son's fine example

17:07.693 --> 17:09.060
and deliver it in Hebrew.

17:09.294 --> 17:10.863
Thank you.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.032
I'll keep this short.

17:14.465 --> 17:15.367
Thanks, Dad.

Well, it's-it's

18:06.518 --> 18:08.587
That means nothing.

It's gibberish.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.323
What?

18:11.323 --> 18:12.891
That's not gibberish,
it's Klingon.

18:15.894 --> 18:17.963
What?

18:17.963 --> 18:19.298
Oh, dear God.

18:19.565 --> 18:23.102
Freddie's dad
just blessed him in Klingon.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.572
sorry.
I'm... I'm terribly

18:26.572 --> 18:28.407
...
I... I

18:28.674 --> 18:30.175
Will you excuse me, please?

18:30.509 --> 18:32.878
RABBI:
Okay, everybody...

18:33.112 --> 18:36.148
it's better to end with laughter than tears.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.550
I don't know how they say it
in outer space,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.954
but here we say

18:41.954 --> 18:45.524
"ahavaandshalom."

18:45.524 --> 18:49.528
Love and peace

18:49.528 --> 18:52.030
Dinner will be served in
the multi-purpose room

18:52.531 --> 18:53.465
in 20 minutes.

18:59.771 --> 19:03.308
Hey, that was awesome, Gaylord.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.810
Shut up, Berman.

19:05.244 --> 19:08.747
Seriously, your dad's Klingon is really good.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.449
What did he say?

19:10.649 --> 19:13.685
Well, roughly translated, it says

19:14.052 --> 19:17.556
"My dearest son,
each day you redeem me.

19:17.923 --> 19:21.493
"May your journey be
filled with the same joy

19:21.493 --> 19:24.429
wisdom and purpose
you have given mine."

19:24.763 --> 19:29.635
It's a lot more beautiful in the original Klingon.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.838
But it's still really cool.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.108
Which one of us do you suppose
humiliated him more?

19:36.408 --> 19:37.476
Oh, I think I did.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.479
I've been trying to console myself with the idea

19:40.979 --> 19:42.981
that without embarrassing parents

19:42.981 --> 19:44.483
there'd be no psychology.

19:44.983 --> 19:46.752
Poor kid.

19:46.952 --> 19:50.856
Actually, today he is a man.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.158
He is, isn't he?

19:53.158 --> 19:54.693
Mazel Tov.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.696
You must be very proud--

19:57.696 --> 20:00.199
of your son, not yourselves.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.702
We are, thank you, Rabbi.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.705
Frederick, uh, listen,
I-I'm... I want to apologize

20:06.705 --> 20:08.707
Uh, there was this guy
at the radio station

20:08.707 --> 20:10.209
he was going to teach me
Hebrew...

20:10.609 --> 20:12.177
You don't have to
explain it, Dad.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.478
Really?

20:13.478 --> 20:16.048
I just wanted
to tell you how sorry I am.

20:16.481 --> 20:19.051
Berman translated your speech
for me.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.519
It was pretty good.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.421
So, you liked it?
Yeah.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.890
I don't want to get
all mushy or anything--

20:24.890 --> 20:26.892
-
I'm a little old for that now-

20:26.892 --> 20:29.228
but, you know...

20:29.528 --> 20:31.563
Yeah... I know.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.464
(chuckles)

20:32.731 --> 20:35.300
Can you forgive me?

20:35.300 --> 20:36.268

Yeah..

20:36.635 --> 20:39.204

but naming me Gaylord.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.743
