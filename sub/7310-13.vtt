WEBVTT

00:09.800 --> 00:11.400
Take the back, McGee.

00:17.700 --> 00:18.700
McGee?

00:19.700 --> 00:22.300
In position, boss. Back door's open.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.900
Federal agents! We have a warrant!

00:38.600 --> 00:39.600
Clear!

00:39.900 --> 00:40.900
Clear!

00:43.500 --> 00:45.900
We've got to stop serving
warrants after lunch.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.800
Ten bucks says McGee
spills it on this one.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.200
Where is McGee?

01:35.700 --> 01:37.600
Looks like a
through-and-through flesh wound.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.900
Well, it's a good thing
McGee's not a better shot.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.600
When did you last have a tetanus shot?

01:43.300 --> 01:44.400
Probably after

01:44.700 --> 01:46.165
that time Dicky Newsome and I were

01:46.200 --> 01:48.900
fighting over the Galactic
Hunt Obi-Wan Kenobi.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.500
So last year sometime?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.765
It was a while ago, Ducky.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.700
Yeah, well, a trip to
the infirmary is in order.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.400
Should we take him to the vet?

01:57.600 --> 02:00.900
The dog is going nowhere but back to
the lab. It's covered with evidence.

02:00.935 --> 02:01.935
Great.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.700
Abby'll have a field day
combing that for evidence.

02:04.900 --> 02:08.300
It is not an "it" or "that."
It is a "he". And he is in pain.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.600
Yes, well, this should alleviate that.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.100
Actually, Dr. Mallard, it would be
more effective in the back of the neck.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.300
Really?

02:23.700 --> 02:25.665
Actually, you should pinch the skin up,

02:25.700 --> 02:27.900
so the needle doesn't
hit the muscle mass.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.700
Where did you learn that, Mr. Palmer?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.900
I spent two summers as a
veterinary assistant during college.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.400
Wonderful.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.700
I should have no
problem patching him up.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.500
- Unless you would rather...
- No, no, carry on.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.000
I have a body with
which to acquaint myself.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.800
Not the only one.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.000
DiNozzo, Ziva, come on.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.800
Boss,

02:52.200 --> 02:53.400
what about me?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.800
Take the evidence back to Abby.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.300
Petty Officer Kyle Hanson,
military working dog handler

03:02.335 --> 03:04.700
with the Pax River
Master-at-Arms Force.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.700
- Drug Enforcement Unit.
- Enforcing everyone but himself.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.500
Given the prevalence of
bite marks, torn flesh,

03:12.800 --> 03:15.400
puncture wounds, I'd postulate that.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.400
Petty Officer Hanson was
the victim of a dog attack.

03:18.435 --> 03:20.400
Really going out on a limb there, Duck.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.300
That assumption is further substantiated

03:23.400 --> 03:26.700
by the presence of a dog
at the scene of the crime.

03:27.100 --> 03:30.600
By cracky, Dr. Mallard, I
believe you've solved the case!

03:31.400 --> 03:33.800
Did you wake up in the
wrong bed this morning?

03:33.900 --> 03:37.200
If your question is: "did I wake
up on the wrong side of the bed?",

03:37.300 --> 03:39.865
the answer is no, but
my mood did sour somewhat

03:39.900 --> 03:42.700
when I walked in and found
that our chief suspect was dead.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.200
And it appears he's been
dead for at least 36 hours.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.000
That explains his disappearance

03:48.100 --> 03:50.600
and why he did not show up
for his dog-handling duties.

03:50.635 --> 03:52.465
Doesn't explain why
his dog turned on him.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.800
It's just too bad, you know.
If we had a little more time,

03:54.835 --> 03:57.111
we would've been able to bust
this guy, turn him and find out

03:57.135 --> 03:59.100
who was shipping drugs
through this base.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.600
Unfortunately,

04:01.000 --> 04:02.400
thanks to Semper Fido,

04:02.700 --> 04:04.300
he's never going to roll over.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.900
Sorry, boss.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.100
- Play dead.
- Gibbs!

04:09.800 --> 04:11.800
I can help. Sorry, sorry, boss.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.600
Room with a view.

04:15.700 --> 04:16.700
Hey!

04:21.800 --> 04:22.800
Cocaine?

04:23.800 --> 04:25.200
Well, you tell me.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.600
Looks like someone was
in a hurry to rip into it.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.000
Or bite into it.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.700
Would explain why the dog
went all Hannibal Lecter.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.200
Sorry, I know. Movie reference.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.600
Cocaine.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.500
And a generous allowance.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.200
If Hanson wasn't dead, we'd
have enough to arrest him.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.600
Hey, McGee.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.400
Oh, my God!

04:53.100 --> 04:54.500
What happened to you?

04:54.700 --> 04:56.700
I was attacked by a vicious dog.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.500
Are you okay?

04:58.700 --> 05:00.500
- Careful, careful.
- Sorry.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.000
Did you provoke it?

05:02.100 --> 05:04.500
If you consider serving
a warrant provoking.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.300
What happened to the dog?

05:06.700 --> 05:08.000
He was shot.

05:08.900 --> 05:09.900
What?!

05:12.500 --> 05:13.600
McGee!

05:14.500 --> 05:16.000
- Poor thing.
- Abby.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.300
Abby, careful, that is one vicious dog.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.000
Yeah, McGee.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.600
It's really vicious.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.900
Well, Ducky and Jimmy sedated him.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.000
We're hoping you can get
some evidence off of him.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.900
There, that's better.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.300
Who would shoot this cute little dog?

05:34.700 --> 05:36.300
Look at you.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.400
It was self-defense.
It... it was self-defense!

05:45.600 --> 05:48.300
You shot that cute little dog?!

05:48.400 --> 05:50.200
He's not cute and little.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.800
He's... he's vicious and large.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.200
How could you shoot an
innocent animal, McGee?

05:55.235 --> 05:57.500
Abby, that dog is not
innocent, he killed someone.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.400
Dogs don't kill people.
People kill people.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.700
People with dogs that
kill people kill people.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.900
You didn't kill anybody, did you?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.300
No.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.100
That's my Hugo Boss.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.000
Don't you think that you're compromising
the evidence with my $500 jacket?

06:20.100 --> 06:21.400
If you think

06:21.900 --> 06:23.400
that I can't distinguish

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
the fibers on your stupid jacket

06:25.700 --> 06:28.800
from the evidence on the
dog, you don't know me, McGee.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.800
And right now? I don't want to know you.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.400
Good dog.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.400
Bad McGee!

06:50.145 --> 06:51.945
I just got a call from Pax River.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.745
The Base Commander's talking
like the case is closed.

06:54.945 --> 06:57.445
That's a dead end. It's still open.

06:58.145 --> 06:59.945
He claims we got our man.

07:00.145 --> 07:03.145
Got one link in a bigger
chain. Still got five suspects.

07:03.345 --> 07:05.410
From his point of view, both the cocaine

07:05.445 --> 07:07.545
and the trafficker were
found. Problem solved.

07:09.845 --> 07:11.210
Is that your point of view?

07:11.245 --> 07:15.245
I can... sympathize with
the Commander's impatience.

07:15.545 --> 07:18.645
Well, you "sympathize".
I'll keep investigating.

07:18.745 --> 07:20.345
Suspect's dead.

07:20.745 --> 07:22.045
You played your hand.

07:22.545 --> 07:24.845
Rest of the team closed up shop.

07:26.545 --> 07:29.745
I can't afford to waste resources
if the trail's gone cold.

07:29.845 --> 07:33.445
Director, the only thing that's
cold is that body in autopsy.

07:34.345 --> 07:35.745
Clock's ticking.

07:36.245 --> 07:39.445
I will inform the Base Commander
that you will be prudent

07:39.645 --> 07:42.045
in your disruption of his operations.

07:51.645 --> 07:52.845
Something else?

07:58.245 --> 08:00.445
- Hey, they check you for rabies?
- No.

08:02.745 --> 08:03.745
What?

08:04.145 --> 08:05.145
Cujo.

08:05.245 --> 08:07.945
You know, the movie? Based
on the novel by Stephen King?

08:08.145 --> 08:09.945
Perfectly friendly Saint Bernard.

08:10.345 --> 08:11.645
Contracts rabies,

08:11.845 --> 08:13.645
bites up everyone in this town.

08:13.845 --> 08:16.645
I mean, people's brains
start swelling up,

08:16.745 --> 08:19.645
leaking out of their ears.
People are foaming at the mouth.

08:21.445 --> 08:22.645
Define foaming.

08:22.845 --> 08:24.410
You do not have rabies.

08:24.445 --> 08:26.645
You're getting him all
worried for no good reason.

08:26.745 --> 08:27.810
She's right, McGruff.

08:27.845 --> 08:30.285
What you should worry about is
whether our dead petty officer,

08:30.345 --> 08:31.710
whose blood was all over the dog,

08:31.745 --> 08:33.909
cause he might have had some
transmittable disease like

08:33.945 --> 08:36.945
- like herpes or hepatitis or Malaria.
- I hadn't thought about that.

08:37.145 --> 08:40.445
Have any of you thought about how
to pick up the pieces to this case?

08:40.544 --> 08:42.110
The one piece that we did have,

08:42.145 --> 08:44.345
Petty Officer Hanson,
is now lying in pieces...

08:44.445 --> 08:46.010
thanks to a possibly rabid dog.

08:46.045 --> 08:49.445
- Bad timing for us and for him.
- What do we know, McGee?

08:49.545 --> 08:52.845
We know that Hanson recently
called a known cocaine trafficker,

08:52.945 --> 08:56.545
Diego Galante, in Panama, and that
Galante has recently disappeared.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.045
- Hiding.
- Or dead.

08:58.345 --> 09:01.310
We also know Galante claimed
he had bribed a flight crew,

09:01.345 --> 09:04.645
and that he had access to Coco
Solo Naval Air Station in Panama,

09:04.845 --> 09:06.710
where C-130s make regular

09:06.745 --> 09:09.845
supply flights from
Pax River every week.

09:09.945 --> 09:13.145
When we cross-check which flights
match that pattern, we come up with...

09:13.180 --> 09:15.245
- Suspects.
- One or more of them?

09:16.345 --> 09:19.645
- Any of them called Galante?
- No, just Hanson.

09:19.745 --> 09:21.810
Galante would have
ditched his cell by now.

09:21.845 --> 09:24.145
I think it's time we go in
and lean on those guys, boss.

09:24.180 --> 09:25.180
Not yet.

09:26.045 --> 09:28.045
- McGee.
- I know, boss.

09:28.945 --> 09:31.845
Boss, we've already been through
all this. I mean, I got no leads.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.245
Ziva's flirted with every
seaman on the base, and McGee's

09:34.280 --> 09:36.545
watched a hundred hours
of Petty Officer Junction.

09:36.645 --> 09:37.845
150, actually.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.645
Go back to Pax River and talk
to the other dog handlers.

09:40.845 --> 09:42.745
See if one of them barks. I know.

09:43.645 --> 09:44.745
Hey, McGee?

09:45.245 --> 09:46.245
Yeah?

09:46.545 --> 09:47.545
You okay?

09:48.645 --> 09:50.245
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, boss.

09:52.245 --> 09:55.545
You're a clean boy. Okay.

09:55.645 --> 09:59.645
Be a good boy while Abby scrubs
the inside of your mouth for DNA.

10:02.045 --> 10:04.345
Who's a good Jethro?

10:04.445 --> 10:06.345
I'm a good Jethro.

10:06.945 --> 10:08.845
Don't be mad. Be flattered.

10:09.145 --> 10:12.845
He's just so strong and handsome
and quiet, so I named him "Jethro".

10:13.045 --> 10:13.910
Abby?

10:13.945 --> 10:15.745
Well, "Butch" was just too...

10:15.945 --> 10:18.445
you know, butch. And don't
worry 'cause I got enough

10:18.545 --> 10:21.445
blood and hair and fiber
samples before I cleaned him.

10:21.545 --> 10:25.345
I don't have results for you yet,
and I know how much you love results.

10:26.045 --> 10:26.810
Abs.

10:26.845 --> 10:28.745
That's not what you're here to tell me.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.245
You're here to tell me

10:30.445 --> 10:33.945
Abby, don't get too attached to the
dog because he doesn't belong to us,

10:34.045 --> 10:36.156
we don't know where the
evidence is going to lead us yet.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.045
- OK good, I won't have to tell you.
- No.

10:38.245 --> 10:39.345
You don't.

10:39.945 --> 10:40.945
Abs.

10:41.345 --> 10:43.145
The dog belongs in the kennel.

10:43.545 --> 10:45.445
No, he doesn't, Gibbs.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.745
He shouldn't be behind
bars. He's innocent.

10:50.045 --> 10:51.545
Okay, come on.

10:52.645 --> 10:54.045
Get inside.

10:55.345 --> 10:56.845
I'm going to prove it to you.

10:56.945 --> 10:59.845
I took a swab from Jethro and I
took a swab from the victim's neck.

11:00.045 --> 11:03.645
When I get the results back, I'm going
to show you that they don't match.

11:03.745 --> 11:05.045
We'll see.

11:09.145 --> 11:11.345
The dog stays in the kennel, Abs.

11:16.145 --> 11:18.845
- Do you know him?
- Lieutenant Commander, flight crew.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.845
Don't know them all. Don't know him.

11:21.145 --> 11:22.545
His name is Warfield.

11:24.045 --> 11:25.645
Do you know Lieutenant Bowen?

11:25.845 --> 11:27.045
No, ma'am.

11:28.545 --> 11:31.545
Can you tell me what kind of
people Hanson was associating with?

11:31.845 --> 11:34.145
Did he say anything to
you before he went UA?

11:35.345 --> 11:37.845
Your shoulders work much
better than your mouth.

11:37.945 --> 11:40.045
I work with dogs, ma'am, not people.

11:40.145 --> 11:41.645
You worked with Hanson.

11:42.045 --> 11:45.445
Did anything about his behavior or
activities seem suspicious to you?

11:46.945 --> 11:48.945
You don't like us being here, do you?

11:49.145 --> 11:51.310
Is it because we are cops
interviewing other cops,

11:51.345 --> 11:54.245
or is it because you guys could not
sniff out who was smuggling drugs,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.345
and we have to do your job for you?

11:56.945 --> 12:00.045
Sorry, ma'am. I just didn't get to
know Petty Officer Hanson all that well.

12:00.545 --> 12:03.345
Obviously, you did not converse
with him on a regular basis,

12:03.445 --> 12:06.545
but, surely, you must have
noticed something about the man.

12:06.945 --> 12:08.445
Hanson was a showboat.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.045
He liked to flaunt the cash.

12:10.945 --> 12:12.445
Draw your own conclusions.

12:12.645 --> 12:15.145
- Dogs you work with ever bite?
- Not mine.

12:15.645 --> 12:18.345
- What about Hanson's?
- Kyle was a friend.

12:18.545 --> 12:20.110
I don't like to speak ill of anybody,

12:20.145 --> 12:22.505
especially not somebody who
died a horrible death like that.

12:22.530 --> 12:24.810
So you're covering cause you
know he guilty of something?

12:24.845 --> 12:28.645
No, sir. Just couldn't keep
complete control of his dog is all.

12:29.345 --> 12:31.245
Got aggressive on me
and others on occasion.

12:31.345 --> 12:34.745
What would happen if a dog
got a taste of some cocaine?

12:35.045 --> 12:36.345
Is that what happened?

12:36.545 --> 12:37.745
It would be bad, sir.

12:37.845 --> 12:39.045
Dog-handling.

12:39.445 --> 12:42.245
Must be a pretty "ruff" job.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.745
I don't want to dog you
with a lot more questions,

12:45.845 --> 12:49.145
but if I need to sniff around more,
is there a number I can call, or...?

12:49.645 --> 12:51.645
Folks inside keep
track of me pretty good.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.045
You can call them.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.745
What about this one, Dr. Mallard?

13:00.245 --> 13:02.245
Those wounds are glancing.

13:02.545 --> 13:04.645
Too much tearing, I'm afraid.

13:05.145 --> 13:08.345
Now, what we're looking
for is a representational

13:08.445 --> 13:10.045
bite-hold.

13:11.745 --> 13:13.345
This one will do.

13:14.945 --> 13:16.345
You know, Mr. Palmer,

13:16.845 --> 13:18.245
a number of these

13:18.345 --> 13:21.145
puncture wounds are exceedingly sharp.

13:21.545 --> 13:25.145
Certain breeds, especially
shepherds, can have needle-sharp teeth

13:25.345 --> 13:27.745
capable of inflicting
severe puncture wounds.

13:28.145 --> 13:30.145
As on the clavicle here.

13:31.145 --> 13:33.445
Did you get your shots, Timothy?

13:34.245 --> 13:35.645
I feel like a dartboard.

13:35.745 --> 13:37.745
Guess that's better
than being a chew toy.

13:38.045 --> 13:42.045
If you're looking for my
findings, I'll be done momentarily.

13:42.245 --> 13:44.245
Actually, Ducky, I was...

13:44.345 --> 13:47.545
I was wondering if you could tell
me what the symptoms of rabies are?

13:48.645 --> 13:51.345
Yes, well, I will yield the
floor to young Palmer here,

13:51.380 --> 13:54.445
and allow our resident dog expert

13:54.645 --> 13:57.645
to explain to you why
you do not have rabies.

13:59.545 --> 14:00.745
You got it?

14:01.345 --> 14:03.445
- Well, I've got enough.
- No, no.

14:03.845 --> 14:05.445
We need to do this one together.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.745
Duck.

14:14.945 --> 14:16.845
Hey, Gibbs. Hey, Ducky.

14:20.845 --> 14:22.145
Did you meet Jethro?

14:22.645 --> 14:24.245
Yeah, quite a number of years ago.

14:24.545 --> 14:27.445
No, not Gibbs. Jethro.

14:27.645 --> 14:30.145
- Say hi to him.
- Hello, Jethro.

14:30.345 --> 14:31.345
Say hi to Ducky.

14:32.745 --> 14:33.610
Abs.

14:33.645 --> 14:34.845
Good boy.

14:34.945 --> 14:36.545
Ducky has his initial findings.

14:38.245 --> 14:42.245
Yes, well, Petty Officer
Hanson was mauled.

14:42.745 --> 14:45.845
He had a neck wound that
severed his carotid artery,

14:45.945 --> 14:47.845
and that made him bleed to death.

14:49.045 --> 14:51.045
You understand what
he's saying to you, Abs?

14:51.145 --> 14:53.445
Well, yeah. Hanson was killed by a dog.

14:53.845 --> 14:55.745
It doesn't say this dog.

14:55.845 --> 14:57.345
Abby, c-come on.

14:57.445 --> 14:59.045
Jethro is innocent.

14:59.345 --> 15:02.545
I found pieces of Hanson's
flesh in Jethro's teeth.

15:02.645 --> 15:04.345
Well, that sounds innocent.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.645
Flesh that had hair follicles on it

15:06.845 --> 15:10.445
- from Hanson's arm, not his neck.
- Well, that's hardly surprising.

15:10.545 --> 15:13.345
We found multiple
perforating injuries on

15:13.445 --> 15:15.645
most of Hanson's extremities.

15:15.845 --> 15:17.945
Well, that hardly suggests
the dog was innocent.

15:18.045 --> 15:20.245
It shows that Jethro

15:20.345 --> 15:22.095
was trying to drag his owner.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.845
He was trying to save Hanson.

15:23.945 --> 15:25.645
Or Hanson was putting up his arms

15:25.745 --> 15:28.445
to protect himself from a
dog that was killing him.

15:28.545 --> 15:30.845
We don't know that. And
there's still a lot of evidence

15:30.880 --> 15:33.045
that has to be processed.
There's the castings.

15:33.145 --> 15:36.945
I haven't gotten a DNA match
yet on the dog's saliva.

15:39.345 --> 15:40.345
Butch?

15:42.445 --> 15:43.445
Butch.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.816
Wait. Go back.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.851
Tolliver just handed
something to Sanchez.

15:56.051 --> 15:57.251
Small package.

15:58.051 --> 15:59.151
Could be drugs.

15:59.651 --> 16:01.051
What's he doing?

16:02.351 --> 16:03.851
He's opening it.

16:05.651 --> 16:07.051
He's examining it.

16:08.951 --> 16:11.551
- He's eating it.
- Looks like Funyuns.

16:12.351 --> 16:13.451
What do we got?

16:13.751 --> 16:16.051
A sudden urge to hit
the vending machines.

16:16.151 --> 16:16.951
McGee?

16:17.051 --> 16:19.816
- Besides eye strain, not much, boss.
- No pressure, boss,

16:19.851 --> 16:23.751
but I just got word the Pax River Five
are shipping out to Panama in 36 hours.

16:23.851 --> 16:26.451
We'll lose access to them for
at least a week, maybe two.

16:26.551 --> 16:27.916
- Bring 'em in?
- No.

16:27.951 --> 16:29.651
We go to them. Catch 'em off guard.

16:29.851 --> 16:32.651
- Shake the tree, see what falls.
- Ziva, DiNozzo.

16:32.751 --> 16:33.751
Let's go.

16:34.951 --> 16:35.951
Boss?

16:36.151 --> 16:38.451
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Gibbs, I've got something.

16:40.351 --> 16:41.651
I'll meet you in the car.

16:45.251 --> 16:47.551
Gibbs. Look in the microscope.

16:49.751 --> 16:51.251
Found cocaine in the dog.

16:51.451 --> 16:53.851
Just look in the
microscope, Gibbs. Do it.

16:56.251 --> 16:57.751
It looks like a bug.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.951
It's not just a bug, Gibbs.

17:00.451 --> 17:01.951
It's a flea!

17:02.551 --> 17:03.651
Okay.

17:04.351 --> 17:05.351
Look.

17:07.251 --> 17:10.651
Ducky found that flea on the deceased.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.451
I went over every inch of Jethro.

17:14.550 --> 17:15.651
Not one flea.

17:15.851 --> 17:18.151
Which means he is totally clean,

17:18.251 --> 17:20.316
which means he's totally innocent.

17:20.351 --> 17:23.151
Flea could've jumped off the dog
and landed on the dead guy, Abs.

17:23.351 --> 17:25.951
That kind of wild conjecture
would never stand up in court.

17:26.151 --> 17:28.251
Did you read the rest of Ducky's report?

17:28.651 --> 17:30.451
Well, sometimes Ducky's wrong.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.251
I mean, not... not often.

17:33.751 --> 17:35.951
Maybe, one time.

17:37.951 --> 17:38.951
Abs,

17:40.051 --> 17:41.551
we have to give the dog back.

17:43.051 --> 17:44.051
Gibbs...

17:45.051 --> 17:46.551
you know what that means.

17:46.851 --> 17:48.451
You can't keep the dog, Abs.

17:51.351 --> 17:52.351
But...

17:55.351 --> 17:56.351
Okay.

17:58.751 --> 18:00.051
Okay.

18:01.251 --> 18:04.551
I'll give him back after I finished
getting all the evidence off of him.

18:05.151 --> 18:08.051
How much more do you need, Abby?

18:08.551 --> 18:10.451
You found cocaine in the dog.

18:11.151 --> 18:13.551
You got the victim's
flesh on the dog's teeth,

18:14.351 --> 18:16.051
dog's Saliva on the victim.

18:16.551 --> 18:18.051
He attacked McGee.

18:18.551 --> 18:19.551
Gibbs.

18:21.051 --> 18:22.851
Look at his eyes.

18:23.251 --> 18:25.151
Does he look like a killer?

18:26.551 --> 18:29.051
You are just making this
rougher on yourself, Abs.

18:34.751 --> 18:36.251
If you have a moment...

18:36.551 --> 18:38.051
up to the office.

18:46.751 --> 18:47.751
Can I help you?

18:47.951 --> 18:50.851
Petty Officer Erica Perelli,
dog handler, Pax River.

18:54.451 --> 18:56.251
You the one shot Hanson's dog?

18:58.751 --> 19:00.551
Looks like he bit you pretty bad.

19:00.751 --> 19:02.851
I've been bitten harder.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.351
By dogs. I love dogs.

19:05.451 --> 19:07.551
I'm a... I'm a dog person, really.

19:07.651 --> 19:09.151
What kind of dog do you have?

19:10.051 --> 19:12.951
I don't yet, but-but I might...

19:13.451 --> 19:15.451
will soon, very soon.

19:15.551 --> 19:18.151
I just need to find
the right girl... dog.

19:18.451 --> 19:20.151
Girl dog. I want a girl dog.

19:20.651 --> 19:24.251
- I do like, boys, though, of course.
- Don't ask, don't tell, McGee.

19:24.851 --> 19:28.351
Hey, boss. This is Petty Officer
Perelli. She is here to...

19:28.651 --> 19:29.951
To collect the dog, sir.

19:30.551 --> 19:32.551
Sorry to say he has to be put down.

19:36.851 --> 19:39.151
I wish there can be another
way, but it's Navy policy

19:39.251 --> 19:40.851
in fatal dog-mauling cases.

19:42.851 --> 19:45.451
Boss, I can take Petty Officer
Perelli down, if you'd like.

19:52.751 --> 19:54.251
You can call me Erica.

19:55.351 --> 19:56.351
Timothy.

19:56.451 --> 19:59.351
There have been a lot of tough
assignments over the years, but...

19:59.851 --> 20:01.351
this is one of the toughest.

20:02.651 --> 20:04.851
It's probably not
going to get any easier.

20:05.051 --> 20:07.051
Abby, our forensic scientist,

20:07.151 --> 20:09.251
has become a bit attached to the dog.

20:10.151 --> 20:11.351
How attached?

20:16.851 --> 20:17.851
Abby?

20:20.151 --> 20:21.151
Abby?

20:34.951 --> 20:36.351
NCIS!

20:38.051 --> 20:40.851
Gather around, kids. We're
gonna have a little chat.

20:41.551 --> 20:43.051
We have a training mission.

20:44.651 --> 20:45.751
Not anymore.

20:47.251 --> 20:49.216
We know without a doubt
that a major cocaine

20:49.251 --> 20:51.751
smuggling operation was
run out of this aircraft.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.751
The name Diego Galante ring any bells?

20:53.851 --> 20:55.451
Major drug trafficker in Panama.

20:55.651 --> 20:57.251
Supplying to someone on this aircraft.

20:57.351 --> 20:58.751
- This is bullcrap.
- Sir,

20:58.851 --> 21:01.851
if by bullcrap, you mean your
worst freakin' nightmare, then,

21:02.451 --> 21:03.651
yeah, this is bullcrap.

21:03.751 --> 21:06.351
Those contrabandistas down
there will say anything.

21:06.751 --> 21:08.051
Doesn't make it true.

21:08.651 --> 21:10.051
Doesn't make it false.

21:10.451 --> 21:11.751
So I heard some rumors.

21:11.851 --> 21:13.916
Some local guy bragging
he bribed the flight crew.

21:13.951 --> 21:16.751
- You didn't believe him.
- Nobody can bribe a whole flight crew.

21:16.851 --> 21:18.551
He only had to bribe one.

21:18.751 --> 21:20.216
As loadmaster, you're in charge

21:20.251 --> 21:22.251
of everything that's
brought aboard the aircraft?

21:22.351 --> 21:23.316
Yes, sir.

21:23.351 --> 21:26.551
So you could sneak aboard
whatever you wanted?

21:27.251 --> 21:28.351
You seem nervous.

21:28.551 --> 21:31.251
- Don't like being questioned by cops.
- Because you did something.

21:31.286 --> 21:33.951
Because it can cause me trouble,
even when I didn't do something.

21:34.051 --> 21:37.851
As flight engineer, I'm in charge of
every moving part of this aircraft, sir.

21:37.951 --> 21:39.751
Gives you access to
every nook and cranny.

21:39.851 --> 21:42.051
Lot of hiding places on a C-130?

21:42.251 --> 21:45.651
If I was smuggling drugs, I'd
be living it up in Georgetown,

21:45.751 --> 21:47.951
not slumming it in the barracks, sir.

21:48.051 --> 21:50.551
I don't believe any of my
men are involved in this,

21:50.951 --> 21:54.551
but even the best aircraft commanders
have a limited field of vision.

21:54.951 --> 21:57.151
Well, it's your crew.
Your responsibility.

21:57.351 --> 21:59.551
You know how long a prison
sentence you'd be facing?

21:59.751 --> 22:01.151
- Life.
- Life.

22:01.251 --> 22:04.951
If you're not involved, you don't
want to go down with the person who is.

22:05.051 --> 22:08.451
If you are involved, and you talk,
you will get a reduced sentence.

22:08.651 --> 22:10.551
A limited-time offer. Otherwise...

22:10.751 --> 22:12.551
We're like a locked-on missile.

22:12.851 --> 22:14.301
The only question is

22:14.336 --> 22:15.751
who we take down.

22:17.551 --> 22:18.851
Think they're all involved?

22:19.351 --> 22:20.151
No.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.451
Think we rattled them?

22:22.551 --> 22:23.651
We'll see.

22:40.951 --> 22:42.351
Can I help you, ma'am?

22:42.451 --> 22:44.251
I'm looking for fleas.

22:45.951 --> 22:46.951
Fleas?

22:47.651 --> 22:48.651
Yeah.

22:50.251 --> 22:51.551
Yes, ma'am.

23:02.583 --> 23:03.783
All right, Jethro.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.783
We're just gathering evidence.

23:06.683 --> 23:08.083
It's for your own defense.

23:09.483 --> 23:10.683
Jethro!

23:11.183 --> 23:12.283
Jethro!

23:12.483 --> 23:14.383
Jethro!

23:14.783 --> 23:16.183
I'm Jethro.

23:16.483 --> 23:17.983
Jethro!

23:18.483 --> 23:20.383
Jethro, come here.

23:21.283 --> 23:22.283
Jeth...

23:22.583 --> 23:23.883
Jethro!

23:24.383 --> 23:26.583
Don't ever do that again!

23:34.683 --> 23:36.983
- Hey, McGee.
- Where'd you take the dog?

23:37.683 --> 23:41.583
- Abby?
- I'm at the naval base, McGee.

23:41.983 --> 23:45.383
You better get down here. I
think we have another body.

23:56.118 --> 23:57.818
Careful, Mr. Palmer.

23:58.118 --> 24:00.818
We're trying to take bones out
of the ground, not put mine in.

24:00.918 --> 24:01.918
Of course.

24:03.218 --> 24:05.018
That dog should have
a muzzle on it, Abby.

24:05.053 --> 24:06.918
Put a muzzle on yourself, McGee.

24:07.418 --> 24:08.918
It's not like he shot you.

24:11.218 --> 24:13.718
I know I shouldn't have taken
him out without authorization,

24:13.753 --> 24:15.083
but time was of the essence.

24:15.118 --> 24:18.018
And besides, Jethro might have
uncovered an important clue.

24:18.118 --> 24:20.518
Or maybe it's another one of
his victims and he's confessing.

24:20.718 --> 24:22.018
Or maybe it's his lunch.

24:22.318 --> 24:24.618
Only if he was a cannibal, Jethro.

24:26.218 --> 24:28.018
I wasn't talking to you.

24:28.118 --> 24:30.518
And, you may want to cover your eyes.

24:30.818 --> 24:32.618
What's here is not human.

24:34.618 --> 24:36.118
It's canine.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.818
Criminal investigation is really an art.

24:41.618 --> 24:44.118
It involves creativity and inspiration.

24:44.518 --> 24:45.618
Don't you think?

24:46.418 --> 24:48.218
You found a clue, Tony.

24:48.418 --> 24:50.018
It does not make you Picasso.

24:51.418 --> 24:53.318
I'm sensing a little frustration here.

24:53.718 --> 24:56.318
Envy. Let it go. It's counterproductive.

24:56.618 --> 24:58.818
Boss, I got something.

24:59.418 --> 25:01.718
The pilot we talked to,
Lieutenant Commander Warfield,

25:02.018 --> 25:03.918
has a cousin stationed at Pax River.

25:04.518 --> 25:06.118
Petty Officer Phillip Granger.

25:06.218 --> 25:08.283
Warfield listed him as
his emergency contact.

25:08.318 --> 25:10.618
Granger was busted for cocaine
possession two months ago.

25:10.653 --> 25:13.018
Failed to appear to face
charges. He has fled.

25:13.318 --> 25:15.518
Family business. Warfield
supplies to his cousin.

25:15.553 --> 25:16.553
Maybe.

25:16.718 --> 25:19.018
- Certainly worth another chat with him.
- Keep digging.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.618
I have more on Lieutenant
Commander Warfield.

25:21.918 --> 25:23.118
You do?

25:27.618 --> 25:28.618
Fetch.

25:31.518 --> 25:32.518
What'd you find?

25:32.618 --> 25:33.968
A little inspiration.

25:34.003 --> 25:35.318
- Hey.
- Hey, Timothy!

25:35.818 --> 25:36.783
Timothy?

25:36.818 --> 25:38.618
I guess she prefers McGee's scent.

25:40.018 --> 25:41.418
She'll eat him alive.

25:43.218 --> 25:44.718
Let it go, Tony.

25:47.018 --> 25:48.918
I'm sorry you had to
make two trips out here.

25:49.018 --> 25:50.118
I don't mind.

25:51.018 --> 25:53.918
Besides the last thing I
want to do is put down a dog.

26:13.518 --> 26:15.418
Pay no attention to him, Jethro.

26:17.818 --> 26:19.518
Abby, open the door.

26:22.318 --> 26:24.318
Jethro has to go now.

26:25.618 --> 26:26.618
Abby.

26:26.818 --> 26:28.818
I can't hear you, McGee.

26:29.518 --> 26:32.018
If you can't hear me,
why did you answer?

26:40.418 --> 26:43.918
I am not opening the door
until Jethro is proven innocent.

26:44.018 --> 26:45.618
Abby, do not make a scene.

26:45.918 --> 26:49.718
Too late, McGee, I
am in full scene mode.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.418
You can't stay in there forever.

26:51.518 --> 26:54.818
I'm fully stocked on
both Caf-Pow! And kibble.

26:55.018 --> 26:56.618
I'm good for at least a few days.

27:04.318 --> 27:07.118
So now you're trying to
pick us off one at a time?

27:07.618 --> 27:09.818
Right now it is not
about us, it is about you.

27:09.918 --> 27:12.318
You are the one with a
cousin busted with cocaine.

27:12.818 --> 27:14.418
Is that what this is all about?

27:14.718 --> 27:16.118
My loser cousin?

27:16.918 --> 27:18.118
We're not even close.

27:18.318 --> 27:20.818
Close enough to give him some
of the blow you smuggled in.

27:20.918 --> 27:22.818
I didn't smuggle anything.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.983
We know that your plane brought it in

27:25.018 --> 27:27.818
every three weeks for
the past three months.

27:28.118 --> 27:29.218
Like clockwork.

27:29.418 --> 27:31.418
Two months ago I was
in a sick bay in Panama

27:32.018 --> 27:33.818
and I didn't fly the aircraft back.

27:34.018 --> 27:36.018
I hopped on a transport a week later.

27:36.418 --> 27:39.718
If you had checked properly, your
own records would prove me innocent.

27:41.718 --> 27:44.818
Records can't prove one's
guilt or one's innocence.

27:44.918 --> 27:47.518
- Damn straight.
- Like this record

27:47.818 --> 27:49.718
from that sick bay in Panama.

27:52.518 --> 27:54.318
For three consecutive days,

27:54.418 --> 27:56.018
you signed out from 2:00

27:56.218 --> 27:58.118
to 5:00 in the afternoon.

27:58.718 --> 28:01.518
Guess you were not too sick
to meet with your supplier.

28:03.318 --> 28:04.418
You got it all wrong.

28:07.618 --> 28:10.718
One phone call and I can get
every record out of Panama,

28:10.753 --> 28:12.718
every single person on
that base interviewed,

28:12.753 --> 28:15.018
every single step you took retraced.

28:15.118 --> 28:17.618
You don't want me making
that phone call, do you?

28:19.118 --> 28:20.118
Where were you?

28:22.618 --> 28:24.118
I will make that call.

28:24.918 --> 28:26.618
I was seeing a woman.

28:29.118 --> 28:30.818
Rosa, a translator.

28:31.518 --> 28:32.818
I was helping her out.

28:33.018 --> 28:34.218
By sleeping with her?

28:34.518 --> 28:35.818
I care about her.

28:36.418 --> 28:38.218
She's a single mom
with a six-year-old.

28:38.718 --> 28:42.318
Her boy had a respiratory infection
real bad, drowning in his own lungs.

28:43.818 --> 28:45.018
That's sad.

28:45.818 --> 28:47.218
No, that's leverage.

28:47.318 --> 28:50.118
So you went to sick bay complaining
of a respiratory infection.

28:50.518 --> 28:52.318
You did it to get drugs for the boy.

28:52.718 --> 28:53.918
He could have died.

28:54.218 --> 28:57.018
Illegal transfer of
prescription medication,

28:57.118 --> 28:59.618
dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming.

29:01.018 --> 29:04.118
I smell a dishonorable
discharge in your future.

29:04.218 --> 29:05.318
Question:

29:06.418 --> 29:08.018
Do you like being a pilot?

29:09.618 --> 29:13.418
I will forget everything you've
just told me if you "remember"

29:13.718 --> 29:14.718
who

29:14.918 --> 29:17.118
in your crew has been
acting suspiciously.

29:21.318 --> 29:24.718
You are willing to give up your entire
career for somebody else's crime?

29:24.818 --> 29:26.518
- No.
- Then give me a name.

29:26.618 --> 29:27.983
I don't have a name.

29:28.018 --> 29:30.618
- You are lying.
- I'm not. I don't know.

29:42.818 --> 29:44.218
He is telling the truth.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.618
Any way you translate it.

30:00.618 --> 30:01.918
Your investigation?

30:03.418 --> 30:04.518
Moving along.

30:13.918 --> 30:17.318
You've been looking at me all week
like you want to ask me something.

30:19.718 --> 30:21.518
Any health issues?

30:22.618 --> 30:23.718
I'm fine.

30:26.318 --> 30:27.618
Are you sick?

30:31.918 --> 30:33.518
My health is fine.

30:34.418 --> 30:36.718
Yours, however, could
take a turn for the worse

30:36.753 --> 30:39.118
if you don't wrap up this investigation.

30:48.818 --> 30:50.918
Go away, McGee.

30:51.618 --> 30:52.818
Abby!

30:54.118 --> 30:55.118
Director.

31:00.518 --> 31:02.418
- Do we have a problem?
- Nope.

31:03.618 --> 31:04.618
No problem.

31:05.218 --> 31:06.218
Good.

31:07.118 --> 31:08.818
Then could you open the door?

31:15.918 --> 31:16.918
Thank you.

31:20.418 --> 31:22.318
He doesn't look very good, does he?

31:22.818 --> 31:25.518
I think it's because he
knows he's on death row.

31:26.118 --> 31:29.218
That would put a damper
on anybody's spirits.

31:30.318 --> 31:33.118
I suppose you're going to
order me to give him up, huh?

31:34.118 --> 31:35.818
Is that what it's going to take?

31:37.518 --> 31:40.818
If I had more time, I could
prove that he didn't do it.

31:42.418 --> 31:44.818
You seem to be the only one
around here who thinks so.

31:44.918 --> 31:47.318
So what? So what if I am?

31:47.518 --> 31:49.818
You have to stand up
for what you believe in.

31:50.118 --> 31:53.918
You have to stick to your guns
until you can make a wrong right.

31:57.318 --> 32:00.118
Sometimes things aren't so simple, Abby.

32:01.018 --> 32:04.318
Sometimes you can't control the outcome.

32:05.118 --> 32:07.218
Sometimes you have to...

32:07.418 --> 32:09.518
look at the reality in front of you...

32:11.118 --> 32:12.318
and accept it.

32:14.018 --> 32:15.018
I can't.

32:18.418 --> 32:19.418
And I won't.

32:24.918 --> 32:26.918
He really doesn't look good, does he?

32:36.218 --> 32:37.818
Finding inspiration?

32:38.018 --> 32:39.418
Whenever I can.

32:41.818 --> 32:43.318
He's my personal McMuse.

32:47.318 --> 32:49.118
"When Dogs Attack!" It's very funny.

32:49.918 --> 32:53.418
All bark, no bite, like
the rest of my team.

32:54.318 --> 32:55.118
Hey.

32:55.318 --> 32:57.418
I just got an e-mail
from Abby with teeth.

32:57.718 --> 33:00.618
Lab results from the cocaine
we found in Hanson's house.

33:00.718 --> 33:03.918
Wrappings contained minute
trace of hydraulic fluid.

33:04.018 --> 33:06.318
The crew member who comes
into contact most often

33:06.353 --> 33:08.918
with hydraulic fluid
is the flight engineer.

33:09.118 --> 33:10.618
Petty Officer Bidwell.

33:13.418 --> 33:14.518
Boss?

33:16.818 --> 33:17.918
Come on.

33:26.318 --> 33:29.518
Flight Operations said
Bidwell was working on a plane.

33:29.718 --> 33:30.718
Check inside.

33:36.318 --> 33:37.818
NCIS.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.118
Petty Officer Bidwell?

34:10.629 --> 34:11.629
Accident?

34:12.929 --> 34:13.893
Not.

34:13.929 --> 34:15.429
Looks like that's the lever

34:15.464 --> 34:16.893
it unlocks all the pallets.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.029
Standard ops is lock as you load.

34:19.429 --> 34:20.429
Jittery partner.

34:20.929 --> 34:23.228
So we know that Bidwell
brought in the drugs

34:24.129 --> 34:26.529
and Hanson helped get
them through the base.

34:27.129 --> 34:29.829
We don't know anything until we
know everything. You keep looking.

34:32.728 --> 34:34.029
Probie-Wan Kenobi.

34:35.829 --> 34:37.228
Wait a second.

34:38.329 --> 34:40.529
What, do you want me to dust
the whole plane by myself?

34:41.929 --> 34:44.629
Just the flat surfaces
where you can lift a print.

34:44.664 --> 34:46.228
Yeah, the whole plane.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.629
Ducky, I need help!

34:50.228 --> 34:51.694
- What happened?
- I don't know!

34:51.728 --> 34:54.129
He was acting funny and then
he started coughing up blood.

34:54.164 --> 34:55.896
Get the X-ray machine, Mr. Palmer.

34:55.931 --> 34:57.629
- Is he dying?
- I don't know.

34:57.664 --> 34:58.929
That's not a good answer!

34:58.964 --> 35:00.929
You must calm down.

35:19.929 --> 35:21.529
In his stomach, right there.

35:21.729 --> 35:22.794
What is it?

35:22.829 --> 35:24.279
Something that doesn't belong.

35:24.314 --> 35:25.694
Prepare to sedate, Mr. Palmer.

35:25.729 --> 35:27.529
You'll find everything
you need in my bag.

35:27.564 --> 35:28.594
Right away, doctor.

35:28.629 --> 35:30.229
We're going to have to operate.

35:31.929 --> 35:33.194
Is he going to be okay?

35:33.229 --> 35:34.629
The inside of a dog's stomach

35:34.829 --> 35:36.029
is like a sewer.

35:36.529 --> 35:38.129
Survival rates are not good.

35:38.629 --> 35:42.129
Well, then both our expertise
are going to be challenged.

35:42.629 --> 35:44.429
Ducky, you know what
you're doing, right?

35:44.464 --> 35:46.229
Well, the fact that he's breathing does

35:46.264 --> 35:48.629
put me somewhat out of my element.

35:49.229 --> 35:52.529
But we don't have a choice, now, do we?

35:53.229 --> 35:54.329
What do we need?

35:55.029 --> 35:57.929
Suture materials, Metzenbaum scissors...

35:58.129 --> 35:59.429
Hemostats.

36:00.129 --> 36:01.929
And scalpels, number ten blade.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.129
All right, thank you.

36:07.729 --> 36:09.629
You may want to leave now.

36:10.329 --> 36:11.694
- No.
- All right.

36:11.729 --> 36:14.129
I need to make an incision

36:14.429 --> 36:17.529
posterior to the xiphoid cartilage.

36:18.129 --> 36:20.429
Retracting the peritoneal fat.

36:20.529 --> 36:22.029
Oh, clip that bleeder, Mr. Palmer.

36:22.329 --> 36:23.529
Here. Hurry, hurry.

36:23.564 --> 36:24.729
All right.

36:25.129 --> 36:26.129
All right.

36:26.929 --> 36:28.129
- Got it.
- Good, good.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.429
Now, pull up the inner mucosal layer.

36:30.729 --> 36:31.929
There you go.

36:32.129 --> 36:33.829
All right, let's see what we got.

36:35.629 --> 36:37.129
Got the little rascal.

36:41.929 --> 36:43.529
Is that what I think it is?

36:44.029 --> 36:45.429
Your Jethro

36:45.629 --> 36:46.594
may be the first...

36:46.629 --> 36:49.729
- Autopsy?
- To survive a trip to the autopsy.

36:50.829 --> 36:51.794
Wait.

36:51.829 --> 36:54.329
- Yes, sir, he's right here.
- We're not out of the woods yet.

36:54.729 --> 36:56.579
Hold on. Dr. Mallard, it's Agent Gibbs.

36:56.614 --> 36:58.429
- Clean this off for me.
- Yeah.

36:59.229 --> 37:00.929
Can you sew him up?

37:00.964 --> 37:01.964
Absolutely.

37:02.829 --> 37:03.829
Jethro.

37:04.229 --> 37:06.929
Duck, need you at Pax River Air Station.

37:06.964 --> 37:08.229
I got a dead petty officer.

37:08.929 --> 37:12.529
Certainly, but we have an
interesting development here,

37:12.564 --> 37:16.029
Jethro, that you will,
you will find fascinating.

37:16.064 --> 37:18.429
The dog from Petty
Officer Hanson's house...

37:19.029 --> 37:20.629
You'll never guess what he swallowed.

37:20.664 --> 37:22.094
It's the tip of a knife, Gibbs!

37:22.129 --> 37:25.029
Yes, well, while Hanson
was definitely mauled,

37:25.229 --> 37:28.029
there was a puncture mark on
his collarbone that troubled me.

37:28.129 --> 37:30.829
I now know that that
puncture mark was made by

37:30.864 --> 37:33.029
this knife, not a dog bite.

37:33.129 --> 37:34.829
It's a perfect match.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.829
Wasn't just the dog that killed him.

37:36.929 --> 37:40.829
No, no, no, no, he had
a human co-conspirator.

37:42.329 --> 37:43.729
Just a minute, Jethro.

37:43.764 --> 37:44.764
Mr. Palmer?

37:45.029 --> 37:49.029
The cervical vertebra from the John
Doe, the one I cleaned off, where is it?

37:49.229 --> 37:50.229
John Doe?

37:50.429 --> 37:51.829
The dead dog, Mr. Palmer.

37:52.929 --> 37:53.729
206.

37:53.929 --> 37:55.729
Stay with me, Jethro.

37:58.329 --> 38:00.029
Yes, as I thought.

38:00.229 --> 38:02.594
The knife point fits
perfectly into the wound

38:02.629 --> 38:05.729
on the cervical vertebrae of
the dog we unearthed yesterday.

38:05.829 --> 38:09.629
If I were a betting man, I'd say
the two crimes were related, Jethro.

38:10.029 --> 38:11.329
Yeah, Duck.

38:11.529 --> 38:13.729
Yeah, that's a bet I'd take, too.

38:18.529 --> 38:19.729
We're going back?

38:20.229 --> 38:21.229
Whoa, boss.

38:21.529 --> 38:24.029
Two people, one mother ship...
this will take all night.

38:24.129 --> 38:26.529
Hope you brought a warm coat, DiNozzo.

38:28.829 --> 38:31.829
Just the flat surfaces where
you can lift the prints, Tony.

38:36.629 --> 38:37.729
Jethro...

38:38.129 --> 38:39.229
is fine.

38:39.929 --> 38:42.129
I'm taking up a collection for flowers.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.529
Why would I give flowers
to a dog that attacked me?

38:47.229 --> 38:49.729
Maybe because dog is man's best friend.

38:49.764 --> 38:52.194
Or maybe because I am a forensic

38:52.229 --> 38:56.029
scientist, and I could boil you from
the inside out and never leave a trace.

39:03.529 --> 39:04.529
Thanks.

39:04.629 --> 39:06.529
Boss, surveillance is a wash.

39:07.129 --> 39:08.729
I've watched all the footage.

39:09.029 --> 39:11.029
That is Bidwell's killer right there.

39:11.829 --> 39:13.529
The other angle's even worse.

39:13.929 --> 39:15.929
Killer knew the plane
was under surveillance.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.029
Gibbs, I've been thinking.

39:18.829 --> 39:21.829
We don't know for certain
that Jethro attacked Hanson.

39:21.929 --> 39:23.679
I mean, he could've
swallowed the knife tip

39:23.714 --> 39:25.394
when as he was licking Hanson's wounds,

39:25.429 --> 39:29.029
which would also account for
the blood that was all over him.

39:29.529 --> 39:30.929
You've already thought of that.

39:33.229 --> 39:35.629
That dog tried to rip me limb from limb.

39:35.929 --> 39:37.529
You do have that effect, McGee.

39:37.729 --> 39:40.829
Especially when you bail on
our biggest crime scene ever.

39:42.629 --> 39:43.729
Got a match.

39:45.029 --> 39:49.029
The knife tip found in Jethro came
from a Navy-issue tactical boot knife.

39:49.329 --> 39:52.429
Find out who ordered a new boot knife
from Pax River in the past 72 hours.

39:52.529 --> 39:53.729
Already on it, boss.

39:54.429 --> 39:55.629
Three people.

39:55.829 --> 39:56.929
One stands out.

39:57.629 --> 39:58.829
Evidence locker, McGee.

39:59.529 --> 40:01.229
Get log 421.

40:05.329 --> 40:06.629
Petty Officer Perelli.

40:06.829 --> 40:07.929
Yes, sir.

40:09.529 --> 40:10.629
What's this about?

40:11.129 --> 40:13.829
Have you received the tactical
boot knife you requisitioned?

40:13.929 --> 40:15.429
How did you know about...?

40:16.429 --> 40:17.529
Not yet, ma'am.

40:17.829 --> 40:20.229
What happened to the knife
you got issued three years ago?

40:20.329 --> 40:21.429
I lost it.

40:21.929 --> 40:23.029
In Hanson's body.

40:23.829 --> 40:25.394
You knew about our investigation.

40:25.429 --> 40:27.329
You and Bidwell need
to pin it on somebody.

40:27.629 --> 40:30.329
You picked Hanson. Was it
because he was suspicious of you?

40:30.429 --> 40:32.494
You killed Hanson and
tried to frame him for it.

40:32.529 --> 40:35.429
You set him up by using his
phone to call Galante in Panama,

40:35.464 --> 40:38.294
then you planted cocaine and
cash in his house for us to find.

40:38.329 --> 40:41.629
Tried to cover your tracks by making it
look like he was killed by his own dog.

40:42.029 --> 40:43.429
Then you killed Bidwell.

40:43.529 --> 40:44.929
'Cause you thought he might crack.

40:45.229 --> 40:46.829
I'm no lawyer,

40:47.429 --> 40:50.029
but this sounds like an
awful lot of conjecture to me,

40:50.329 --> 40:51.329
sir.

40:52.029 --> 40:54.629
Your whole case is me
requisitioning a boot knife.

40:55.029 --> 40:57.129
You really think that's
going to hold up in court?

40:57.929 --> 40:59.029
Nah.

40:59.929 --> 41:00.929
Neither do I.

41:02.429 --> 41:03.729
You got a warrant?

41:03.764 --> 41:04.829
In my pocket.

41:05.229 --> 41:06.229
Seek!

41:06.264 --> 41:07.264
Seek.

41:10.629 --> 41:12.629
You still got that magic, McGee.

41:12.829 --> 41:14.529
Heel. Good dog.

41:19.329 --> 41:21.729
Evidence log number 421, cocaine.

41:30.329 --> 41:32.029
Your dog don't hunt.

41:34.029 --> 41:35.129
Up, boy.

41:35.329 --> 41:38.529
You killed the drug-sniffing dog
and replaced him with an attack dog.

41:38.564 --> 41:40.829
'Cause you needed a dog that
wouldn't react to cocaine.

41:41.229 --> 41:42.394
You're under arrest

41:42.429 --> 41:45.329
for the murders of Petty Officer
Hanson and Petty Officer Bidwell.

41:52.429 --> 41:55.229
You just seem to attract all
the sick puppies, Timothy.

42:00.529 --> 42:01.729
Hey, Abs.

42:03.029 --> 42:04.029
Hey.

42:04.829 --> 42:05.929
What's wrong?

42:06.729 --> 42:09.729
Gibbs asked the base commander
if I could keep Jethro.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.629
He said no?

42:13.129 --> 42:14.329
He said yes.

42:15.029 --> 42:16.729
Then... why are you...?

42:16.764 --> 42:18.429
My landlord said no.

42:21.129 --> 42:22.329
Well, that's too bad.

42:23.029 --> 42:25.229
I have to find Jethro a good home.

42:26.629 --> 42:28.529
He's a distinguished veteran.

42:36.129 --> 42:37.929
He deserves to be happy, McGee.

42:39.429 --> 42:40.729
Abby, no, no.

42:40.829 --> 42:42.929
- No.
- You have been looking for a dog.

42:43.629 --> 42:46.329
That dog tasted my blood
and I think he liked it.

42:46.929 --> 42:47.729
Okay.

42:47.829 --> 42:51.229
Sometimes you have to look at
the reality in front of you,

42:51.329 --> 42:52.829
and just accept it.

42:53.429 --> 42:54.429
You...

42:54.629 --> 42:56.929
are taking Jethro.

42:57.829 --> 42:59.129
Accept it.

43:01.029 --> 43:03.129
McGee, Jethro,

43:03.729 --> 43:05.329
shake.

43:05.829 --> 43:08.229
All right, Jethro, you're
gonna have to be the bigger man.
