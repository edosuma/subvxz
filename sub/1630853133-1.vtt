WEBVTT

01:41.968 --> 01:44.338
How'd you know I was alone?

01:44.472 --> 01:46.806
Well, he could have
been with me so...

01:49.043 --> 01:50.677
I know, but maybe
try not to completely

01:50.810 --> 01:53.247
destroy my life
the next time you're lonely.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.183
I mean...

01:57.717 --> 02:01.088
Yeah.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.758
Yeah, I set a really
high standard for.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.339
Excuse me.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.540
Ma'am.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.809
Excuse me.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.180
I know you can hear me.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.786
Ah, shit.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.488
I knew you saw me
in the parking lot.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.599
Okay, so we're just walking
into somebody else's...

05:56.623 --> 05:58.525
This is exactly
as I pictured it.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.892
What the hell does that mean?

06:00.094 --> 06:01.729
Not the specifics, but the tone,

06:01.861 --> 06:04.598
the tone fits.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.034
Erica Shaw, I googled you.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.535
That's not less unsettling.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.305
When I hired you to do
my sister's funeral,

06:11.438 --> 06:13.507
I looked up a few
business reviews online,

06:13.640 --> 06:16.943
but I had no idea my sister
was getting a video send-off

06:17.077 --> 06:19.979
from one of the most
promising new voices

06:20.114 --> 06:22.882
in American documentary. Wow.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.386
What happened?

06:28.622 --> 06:30.090
You googled me.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.202
For the record, there was no
way you could've known that

06:32.226 --> 06:33.960
- that kid was...
- Lotta work.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.462
Excuse me?

06:35.662 --> 06:36.972
I have a lot of work
I have a deadline...

06:36.996 --> 06:38.532
- How did you know?
- What?

06:38.665 --> 06:40.701
The house, red, a frame?

06:40.834 --> 06:43.203
You give me the photos,
I cut everything together

06:43.337 --> 06:44.904
according to aesthetic
continuity...

06:45.105 --> 06:46.973
I was the only one
she told about the affair.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.009
How did you know?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.447
I saw it.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.580
So what?

06:54.648 --> 06:59.086
I saw the... truth,

06:59.219 --> 07:02.356
the thing behind
what everybody else sees.

07:02.489 --> 07:07.761
It just happens sometimes...
Certain people, pictures,

07:07.895 --> 07:10.664
places, I have an instinct or...

07:10.798 --> 07:12.399
A gift.

07:12.533 --> 07:16.804
Isn't that what you used
to call it in interviews.

07:16.936 --> 07:20.474
Yeah. I thought that sounded
real cool when I was 20.

07:20.607 --> 07:24.578
- Until of course...
- Can I point you toward a grief counselor or a therapist

07:24.711 --> 07:28.248
or someone who, I don't know,
isn't in my apartment?

07:28.382 --> 07:31.452
I didn't come here to
talk about my sister.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.922
I have another job for you.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.956
Another dead relative?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.928
I'm sorry, that was...
I was out of line.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.030
A different kind of job,

07:43.163 --> 07:45.599
more in line with
what you used to do.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.135
Not a real documentary,
not yet at least.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.670
But my father,
Campbell Bradford,

07:49.870 --> 07:52.473
has led quite a life,
what I know about it.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.476
He comes from this small
town in Indiana, west baden...

07:55.609 --> 07:57.244
Midwestern,
forgettable, whatever...

07:57.377 --> 07:59.313
I just make funeral
videos now and weddings,

07:59.446 --> 08:01.048
if it's a light month,
that's all.

08:01.248 --> 08:05.252
I figured someone with
your unique skill set

08:05.385 --> 08:09.523
might be able to uncover
a little bit about

08:09.656 --> 08:12.459
- who he was there, his history.
- I'm not the right person.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.562
The advance will cover
as much as you'd make

08:15.696 --> 08:18.632
if you worked every single
day for the next two months.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.568
You should go see him before
you leave for Indiana.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.103
I didn't say
I was gonna do this.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.806
It would be good to
meet the inspiration

08:25.939 --> 08:27.107
for your next film.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.510
I've already booked
a room for you.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.012
Just wait till you see
the hotel down there.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.614
Oh, I almost forgot.

08:33.747 --> 08:38.151
My sister found this
in my father's safe

08:38.285 --> 08:41.221
when she was going
through his things

08:41.355 --> 08:42.756
and getting them in order.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.491
It's a relic from west baden.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.545
I thought you might find
it useful or interesting

08:46.593 --> 08:48.295
or whatever.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.098
It's the only thing
that survived the crash.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.541
Jesus.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.211
Okay.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.646
Mr. Bradford?

09:41.448 --> 09:44.818
Campbell, my name is Erica Shaw,

09:44.952 --> 09:47.220
your daughter hired me to...

09:49.189 --> 09:50.791
Well, I don't know exactly,

09:50.924 --> 09:53.827
but she's used to getting
what she wants, isn't she?

09:53.961 --> 09:56.997
Level with me Campbell,
she's part witch, right?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.633
I knew it.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.012
I've got to say most people
looked pretty nervous on camera,

10:02.036 --> 10:05.238
but you look totally unfazed.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.314
I like your taste in music.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.684
It's haunting. Nice.

10:17.818 --> 10:22.856
Okay, well, whenever you're
ready, let it all out.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.658
Hopes, dreams, regrets.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.366
Okay.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.134
She can't say I didn't try.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.342
Hello.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.388
You messing with me, Campbell?

11:01.228 --> 11:02.663
Oh, come on.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.000
All right, okay.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.344
That's good. That's a good one.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.870
You got me.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.740
Well, you feel like talking?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.012
Yes.

11:18.146 --> 11:20.247
Holy shit, he speaks.

11:21.149 --> 11:22.416
Pardon my...

11:22.549 --> 11:24.184
It's all right, it's fine.

11:29.723 --> 11:33.727
Okay. So this job I'm supposed
to find out about your past

11:33.860 --> 11:37.898
before Chicago.
Feel like saying anything?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.935
There's not much to say.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.197
And whatever you do
say is only gonna be

11:45.238 --> 11:47.507
when I'm looking through
the camera, is that right?

11:52.779 --> 11:56.283
Okay, gotta admire your
commitment to the bit.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.286
Tell me about the town.
West baden, is it?

12:00.088 --> 12:03.590
Nice place... to hide.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.360
Hide?

12:09.329 --> 12:10.697
Disappear.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.869
- Why would you wanna disap...
- It's the river.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.338
It runs deep
under the whole town.

12:21.109 --> 12:22.743
Never find you in there...

12:24.377 --> 12:26.214
Who wouldn't? Can we go back?

12:26.346 --> 12:27.346
Why would you be hiding?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.648
I'm confused.

12:35.156 --> 12:36.690
Tell me about the river.

12:39.227 --> 12:40.694
Look, I don't wanna press you,

12:40.894 --> 12:42.996
but this might be your only
chance to tell your story

12:43.131 --> 12:44.431
in your words.

12:47.168 --> 12:48.602
No?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.838
Okay.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.141
What about this?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.009
You know anything about this?

12:56.777 --> 12:58.512
Does this mean anything to you?

13:10.258 --> 13:11.491
His blood.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.830
His name.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.032
Who's name.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.667
You should not have this.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.704
- Your daughter gave it to me.
- It's evil. It's broken.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.678
What have you done?

13:33.613 --> 13:36.083
I'm sorry, I thought
it was just...

13:37.285 --> 13:39.452
What have you done?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.560
Why is the bottle so
important, Campbell?

13:49.197 --> 13:51.531
Why is the bottle so important?

13:52.499 --> 13:53.733
Mister...

13:56.536 --> 13:57.871
Campbell?

14:17.624 --> 14:21.528
<i>♪ The guy she looks up to ♪</i>

14:25.333 --> 14:29.303
<i>♪ did you tell me
for a reason? ♪</i>

16:46.073 --> 16:47.707
Wait till you see the inside.

17:19.507 --> 17:21.175
Never gets old, does it?

17:21.308 --> 17:24.278
Are you here on business
or for the rebirth festival?

17:24.412 --> 17:26.080
No, no, definitely business.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.616
I can tell. I can always
tell, but if I may be so,

17:29.749 --> 17:32.053
I hope you'll be joining
us for the big event.

17:32.186 --> 17:34.522
You might be thinking you know,
but trust me, you don't.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.023
It is fun for the whole...

17:36.157 --> 17:37.991
Are you here alone?
Doesn't matter.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.361
You're gonna love it. I'm Dylan.

17:40.494 --> 17:41.895
I run all
the special events here.

17:42.096 --> 17:44.098
None more special than
our yearly festival,

17:44.231 --> 17:47.101
which I truly hope
you'll be able to attend.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.035
I don't think I...

17:48.169 --> 17:50.104
I'll put you down as a maybe.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.871
Leaning yes.

17:52.006 --> 17:54.075
Don't underestimate
the charm of this place.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.975
We'll get you one
way or another.

17:57.378 --> 17:58.711
Business or rebirth.

20:31.465 --> 20:33.267
What have you done?

20:58.626 --> 20:59.959
You try the water?

21:02.162 --> 21:04.098
Famous for our water down here.

21:04.231 --> 21:05.332
Springs.

21:05.466 --> 21:07.334
People used to say
it cured everything

21:07.468 --> 21:09.203
from cavities to cancer.

21:09.336 --> 21:10.696
Figure whatever
you're dealing with

21:10.803 --> 21:12.805
might fit somewhere in there.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.209
Is it that obvious?

21:15.409 --> 21:16.819
You're too young to be
asking the bartender

21:16.843 --> 21:18.379
to turn down the music.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.348
It's just a headache.

21:21.482 --> 21:23.250
Where are you from?

21:24.151 --> 21:25.852
You know, I'm not really in...

21:25.985 --> 21:27.554
Message received.

21:33.594 --> 21:38.265
Sometimes a woman just needs
to drink alone all by herself,

21:38.399 --> 21:40.200
an island.

21:40.334 --> 21:42.436
Even in a world where
we've already lost

21:42.569 --> 21:43.803
all sense of community

21:44.004 --> 21:46.140
and the only real
contact we have anymore

21:46.273 --> 21:48.609
is through
the Internet and email...

21:48.742 --> 21:51.779
- Chicago.
- I love Chicago.

21:51.911 --> 21:55.815
I mean, it's been
years, decades.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.685
Used to take the train
there all the time

21:57.817 --> 22:00.154
with my husband before the kids.

22:01.188 --> 22:03.223
Trains haven't run in years,

22:03.357 --> 22:07.695
but the tracks are still out
back just off the property.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.330
Used to be
the only way in or out

22:09.463 --> 22:12.032
if you were coming
from out of town.

22:12.166 --> 22:16.570
Now, well, it's almost
too easy to get here, isn't it?

22:20.541 --> 22:21.642
Ann mckinney.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.078
Erica Shaw.

22:24.211 --> 22:26.946
What brings you to
west baden, Ms. Shaw?

22:27.914 --> 22:30.250
- I'm a filmmaker.
- Fancy.

22:30.384 --> 22:33.220
Not really that kind of, um...
It's a documentary...

22:33.354 --> 22:35.855
You're making a documentary
about the hotel.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.224
I don't know exactly.

22:37.358 --> 22:39.560
Actually iu's
sending me an intern.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.438
She's gonna be here
any minute, so I should...

22:41.462 --> 22:46.767
Rebuilt in 1902 after it burned
down for the second time.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.469
Forget about death and taxes.

22:48.602 --> 22:51.705
This hotel is the one true
certainty in west baden.

22:51.839 --> 22:52.939
Yeah?

22:53.140 --> 22:57.578
I mean, look at it. Really look.

22:57.711 --> 23:01.648
Like one of those churches
you hear about in Italy

23:01.782 --> 23:03.617
or somewhere like that.

23:03.751 --> 23:06.687
Sure is something, isn't it?

23:06.820 --> 23:09.256
You probably already heard
about the festival of...

23:09.390 --> 23:12.659
Rebirth. Yeah, I met Dylan.

23:14.961 --> 23:18.098
Sounds corny. Maybe it is.

23:18.232 --> 23:23.003
But ever since I was old
enough to have memories,

23:23.137 --> 23:27.307
I've never missed
the festival, not once.

23:27.441 --> 23:30.277
Hard not to celebrate
something this special.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.214
From the ashes.

23:38.886 --> 23:40.354
From the ashes.

23:43.290 --> 23:46.059
So what's it about?

23:46.193 --> 23:48.662
- What?
- Your documentary.

23:48.796 --> 23:50.636
I wouldn't really use
that word to describe it.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.977
It's more of
a character profile.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.434
Look...

23:53.634 --> 23:55.274
I don't wanna stick
my nose into anything,

23:55.402 --> 23:59.939
but I am sort of known as
the unofficial historian

24:00.073 --> 24:02.242
of the Springs valley.

24:02.376 --> 24:06.180
I got a world of knowledge
about a speck of land.

24:06.313 --> 24:08.682
So if there's anyone you
wanna know something about

24:08.816 --> 24:10.784
from around here,
I am definitely one...

24:10.918 --> 24:12.985
Campbell Bradford.

24:20.194 --> 24:21.595
You know him?

24:21.795 --> 24:24.665
It's getting late, and you got
that intern coming in,

24:24.798 --> 24:28.335
so good luck, Ms. Shaw.

27:04.858 --> 27:06.560
We actually met,
like, five years ago,

27:06.693 --> 27:09.763
I was at this line
for a movie panel thing,

27:09.896 --> 27:12.132
and, um, I was actually
wearing this cardigan,

27:12.265 --> 27:14.267
and, uh, we locked eyes,
but you left

27:14.401 --> 27:17.105
before I got the chance
to... it wasn't 'cause...

27:17.237 --> 27:20.807
Sorry that I didn't mention
anything about the fandom

27:20.941 --> 27:22.342
when I applied to
be your intern.

27:22.542 --> 27:23.686
I just... I didn't
want to creep you out

27:23.710 --> 27:25.579
or make things super weird.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.115
You were cool with lying though.

27:27.247 --> 27:29.349
Omission lies,
they're like so not.

27:30.183 --> 27:32.285
I'm sorry, but come on.

27:32.419 --> 27:34.221
Come on, "song of the sick."

27:34.354 --> 27:35.555
- "Dead special."
- Okay.

27:35.689 --> 27:37.491
"Dead special:
Behind the scenes."

27:37.624 --> 27:39.093
Congrats, you're aware of imdb.

27:39.226 --> 27:40.293
"All the little breaks."

27:40.427 --> 27:42.229
And you hacked my vimeo account.

27:43.497 --> 27:45.766
- Jesus.
- Recognize it?

27:45.899 --> 27:47.410
- Why would I recognize...
- Milt staley.

27:47.434 --> 27:48.769
"Asleep at the wheel."

27:50.437 --> 27:51.605
How did you get this?

27:51.738 --> 27:53.340
Uh, soon as it
started streaming,

27:53.540 --> 27:55.085
that kid was on eBay
selling practically

27:55.109 --> 27:56.386
anything that showed up
in the doc.

27:56.410 --> 27:58.178
I tried to buy
his mustang, but...

27:58.311 --> 28:00.981
- That's a pretty cool consolation prize.
- It's probably a fake.

28:01.115 --> 28:04.951
But it looks real,
and it's sharp as fuck, so...

28:06.154 --> 28:07.921
I don't mean that...

28:08.056 --> 28:11.825
I'm... I am your biggest fan.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.528
No, really, I have read
every old interview of yours.

28:14.661 --> 28:18.598
The way that you talk about
process, how projects found you,

28:18.732 --> 28:22.536
how they haunted you,
how you would channel certain...

28:22.669 --> 28:24.048
I mean, people they always
get so precious about

28:24.072 --> 28:25.581
having some sort
of psychic connection-

28:25.605 --> 28:26.907
that's not a word I would use.

28:27.041 --> 28:29.676
Right, I wasn't...
It's always fate.

28:31.611 --> 28:32.679
It's always fate.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.024
- Oh, god.
- Those are your words.

28:34.048 --> 28:35.315
You said that shit.

28:35.449 --> 28:37.751
I don't even believe
in fate or whatever,

28:37.884 --> 28:43.924
but us in this moment
in a place like this...

28:44.058 --> 28:46.393
It kind of makes you believe
that everything happens for...

28:46.526 --> 28:48.595
- Okay, just get to it.
- What?

28:48.729 --> 28:51.231
Just get to the part where
you asked me what happened.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.570
I know what happened.

28:56.703 --> 29:00.307
<i>Lonnie wilkes,
"some kind of hell."</i>

29:04.845 --> 29:07.514
<i>And there's no way
you could've known.</i>

29:07.647 --> 29:08.982
<i>No one could've
seen that coming.</i>

29:09.117 --> 29:10.617
<i>Not even you.</i>

29:10.751 --> 29:13.054
<i>After your film got
his case overturned,</i>

29:13.187 --> 29:16.523
<i>what he did to his family
the day he got out.</i>

29:16.656 --> 29:19.926
<i>It's not your fault he ended up
being a total monster.</i>

29:20.061 --> 29:22.429
You chased down that film
with everything that you had,

29:22.562 --> 29:25.499
and you made
something beautiful.

29:27.768 --> 29:29.503
You made something beautiful.

29:31.471 --> 29:34.708
That was the first thing
of yours I'd ever seen.

29:34.841 --> 29:40.313
I was 16, and it changed me.

29:41.882 --> 29:43.050
It did.

29:44.118 --> 29:47.121
Now, anyone can ask,
"what happened?"

29:47.255 --> 29:51.825
And the real question is,
"was it worth it?"

29:51.958 --> 29:53.227
What?

29:53.360 --> 29:54.928
Putting yourself
out there like that

29:55.062 --> 29:57.464
and creating real
beauty only to...

29:57.597 --> 29:59.366
Lose it all?

30:01.001 --> 30:02.769
I still see him.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.173
Just him.

30:05.305 --> 30:06.740
Sometimes the family.

30:08.708 --> 30:10.677
It wakes me up
out of a dead sleep.

30:13.014 --> 30:14.048
It keeps me up.

30:21.421 --> 30:23.690
You almost got an Oscar, though.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.427
So?

30:30.330 --> 30:31.965
So, what?

30:32.099 --> 30:35.569
- So what do you see, like, here?
- What do I see?

30:35.702 --> 30:38.672
I mean, are you picking up
on, like, a certain vibe?

30:38.805 --> 30:40.640
Are you getting a certain...

30:40.774 --> 30:42.286
A place like this
for someone like you,

30:42.310 --> 30:44.470
- there's got to be all kind of...
- Campbell Bradford.

30:45.612 --> 30:47.547
- Who?
- I don't know what the story is

30:47.681 --> 30:49.041
or the angle,
if there even is one,

30:49.083 --> 30:51.018
but we definitely don't
have anything

30:51.152 --> 30:52.152
until we find out

30:52.220 --> 30:54.255
who Campbell Bradford is

30:54.421 --> 30:56.090
or was when he was...

30:57.524 --> 30:58.524
Here.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.228
That's the job.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.928
How hard can that be?

31:06.967 --> 31:08.069
Erica?

32:38.092 --> 32:39.160
You okay?

32:41.661 --> 32:42.929
Erica.

32:46.067 --> 32:48.635
Let's go somewhere less here.

32:56.344 --> 32:57.345
Really?

32:57.477 --> 32:59.679
Google west baden nightlife.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.515
There's like a bar area.

33:02.649 --> 33:04.085
Sold.

33:04.218 --> 33:06.553
So, we doin' roulette
with the old couple

33:06.686 --> 33:08.755
or penny slots
with the... oh, yeah,

33:08.888 --> 33:10.991
that guy is actually dead.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.560
Look, I don't wanna to
be weird about things,

33:13.693 --> 33:14.961
obviously.

33:15.162 --> 33:16.472
Now that we're working
together, you know,

33:16.496 --> 33:18.232
this is a really
big deal for me,

33:18.366 --> 33:19.799
collaborating with Erica Shaw.

33:19.933 --> 33:21.610
Are you cool with me calling
this a collaboration?

33:21.634 --> 33:23.246
'Cause this really feels
like a collaboration.

33:23.270 --> 33:26.940
I'm definitely getting, like,
a collaborative vibe happening.

33:27.074 --> 33:28.074
Do you know him?

33:28.242 --> 33:30.011
- Who?
- The guy you're staring at.

33:30.144 --> 33:32.846
- What guy?
- But he's walking this way right now.

33:32.979 --> 33:36.050
Just so you know, tomorrow, when you
regret this, I had no part in any of it.

33:36.183 --> 33:39.619
- It's you.
- Oh, so this is, like, an established thing?

33:39.753 --> 33:40.920
I work at the hotel.

33:41.055 --> 33:42.789
I stay at hotel.

33:43.723 --> 33:45.892
- Josiah.
- Erica.

33:47.560 --> 33:48.795
Kellyn.

33:49.763 --> 33:51.098
I'm kellyn, hi.

33:51.232 --> 33:53.300
You play Blackjack?

33:53.434 --> 33:55.702
Saved a spot for you over here.

33:55.835 --> 33:59.106
Cool. That's cool, thanks.

34:00.274 --> 34:01.574
Oh wait. So, I don't understand,

34:01.708 --> 34:03.210
it's like a movie movie or...

34:03.411 --> 34:06.213
It's like a home movie
for somebody else's family.

34:06.347 --> 34:07.491
And they pay you for that shit?

34:07.515 --> 34:09.283
Yeah, it's honest work, sort of.

34:09.417 --> 34:13.120
No work is honest if you're
doing it for someone else.

34:13.254 --> 34:14.854
Cool, so you actually
own the hotel.

34:14.988 --> 34:18.092
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

34:18.225 --> 34:20.894
Yeah, see, you're welcome,
set you up perfectly for that.

34:21.928 --> 34:23.930
Be something though wouldn't it?

34:24.065 --> 34:24.731
What?

34:24.864 --> 34:26.100
Owning that place?

34:27.268 --> 34:29.669
I don't know. It seems
like a lot of work.

34:29.803 --> 34:31.638
Can't even keep
my apartment clean.

34:34.075 --> 34:36.843
- What?
- You don't fool me, Erica from Chicago.

34:36.976 --> 34:39.080
- Oh, no?
- No, you do not.

34:39.213 --> 34:41.881
You can sit there, you know,
act like you're cool,

34:42.016 --> 34:45.152
laid back, but you got it too.

34:45.286 --> 34:49.356
The sickness.
I can see it in your eyes.

34:49.490 --> 34:51.325
What do you mean by that?

34:51.459 --> 34:53.394
You want more than you got.

34:53.527 --> 34:57.031
I know because I have it too.

34:57.164 --> 34:59.233
'Cause this maintenance
thing, I mean,

34:59.366 --> 35:01.135
this is, like,
a temporary kind of...

35:01.268 --> 35:02.979
Look, I've done it all here.
I was a bartender.

35:03.003 --> 35:05.172
I was a mechanic's apprentice.

35:05.306 --> 35:06.866
Blasted limestone
for a couple of years.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.476
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah?

35:08.608 --> 35:10.211
Yep, that is a job. Yes, indeed.

35:10.344 --> 35:12.222
I... actually, I still got
all my gear in the car.

35:12.246 --> 35:13.926
You need me to blow up
a wall or something.

35:13.980 --> 35:16.584
Hey, I might take you up
on that one day.

35:16.716 --> 35:19.220
You know, it is what it is.

35:19.353 --> 35:20.963
Be honest with you,
it's the best job I ever had.

35:20.987 --> 35:22.467
The world's designed
to kick your ass,

35:22.590 --> 35:25.226
but you get yourself
a drill, a little dynamite...

35:25.359 --> 35:26.759
You can be your own
force of nature.

35:26.893 --> 35:28.895
Yeah. Why'd you give it up?

35:30.431 --> 35:32.500
Boss was dick, pay sucked.

35:32.632 --> 35:35.169
Besides I always knew that
I was meant for bigger shit.

35:36.437 --> 35:37.770
World dominance?

35:39.540 --> 35:42.076
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

35:42.209 --> 35:43.987
I mean, that's right up there
on my list of shit to do.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.645
I mean, you know,
I might start with

35:45.778 --> 35:47.548
running a business first, maybe.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.983
"Josiah Bradford, incorporated."

35:50.584 --> 35:51.985
Bradford?

35:52.119 --> 35:53.563
Well, yeah, I mean, maybe
my name goes on there,

35:53.587 --> 35:56.423
maybe I make some shit up
like Microsoft.

35:56.557 --> 35:58.658
Point is, I got plans, okay?

35:58.791 --> 36:00.027
A lot bigger than this valley,

36:00.161 --> 36:02.662
sure as hell bigger
than that hotel.

36:03.696 --> 36:05.832
To "Josiah Bradford,
incorporated."

36:19.580 --> 36:21.215
So you grew up in west baden?

36:22.016 --> 36:25.718
- What?
- You... nothing.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.226
What about your family?

36:32.426 --> 36:34.061
You guys been here
the whole time?

36:34.195 --> 36:35.329
My family?

36:35.529 --> 36:37.464
Wait, what are we...
What are we talking about?

36:37.598 --> 36:39.567
Nothing, just...

36:39.699 --> 36:41.901
Look, I didn't mean to...

36:42.036 --> 36:43.736
Some fuckin' room, right?

36:43.870 --> 36:47.675
Yeah. Yeah, everything here's...

36:47.807 --> 36:49.876
You know,
I've lived here forever.

36:50.010 --> 36:51.378
I work at this goddamn place,

36:51.579 --> 36:53.947
I've never actually been
in one of these rooms.

36:56.450 --> 36:58.085
Must be nice.

36:58.219 --> 36:59.453
Josiah.

36:59.653 --> 37:02.489
I... you know what? I think
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

37:02.623 --> 37:03.623
No, c'mon, stay.

37:03.657 --> 37:05.159
Let's have a drink.

37:05.292 --> 37:06.826
What's that?

37:07.827 --> 37:09.363
Nothing, it's just this thing.

37:09.496 --> 37:11.764
Come on, let's have
a real drink.

37:15.102 --> 37:19.473
Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

37:19.607 --> 37:23.377
Maybe it's just because you've
lived here your whole life,

37:23.510 --> 37:27.947
but this town...
And maybe it's the hotel...

37:29.816 --> 37:31.218
It really puts you
in a weird place.

37:31.352 --> 37:32.952
And anyway, it's nice
to talk to somebody

37:33.053 --> 37:34.664
who knows what it's like
to grow up in a place...

37:34.688 --> 37:36.257
Ugh, tastes like shit.

37:38.791 --> 37:39.859
Did you just...

37:39.993 --> 37:41.228
Cold as fuck, too.

37:43.863 --> 37:45.999
You know, you really
shouldn't just...

37:51.138 --> 37:53.098
Sorry, I didn't mean...
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

37:53.173 --> 37:55.175
Yeah, maybe you're right.

37:55.309 --> 37:57.278
- What?
- Maybe you should go.

38:06.953 --> 38:09.490
Hey. Hey look, I'm sorry
I didn't mean to do...

38:09.623 --> 38:10.957
- It's fine.
- No, seriously.

38:11.091 --> 38:12.526
I said it's fine.

38:17.964 --> 38:19.433
What? What is it?

38:21.035 --> 38:22.603
Nothing. You should go.

38:22.736 --> 38:24.971
- Erica.
- Go!

38:50.164 --> 38:51.444
Look, Campbell,
you're just gonna

38:51.532 --> 38:53.833
- have to accept the realities.
- Quiet.

39:05.079 --> 39:06.447
Excuse me?

39:06.580 --> 39:08.048
Excuse me, miss?

39:08.182 --> 39:10.417
Wondering if you
could help me out.

39:10.551 --> 39:11.984
Have you seen him?

39:12.119 --> 39:14.188
Wanted for murder,
possible kidnap.

39:14.321 --> 39:15.988
Still might have
that boy with him.

39:16.123 --> 39:18.092
Perhaps a closer look
will help you.

40:16.283 --> 40:17.785
And the thing no one tells you

40:17.917 --> 40:21.088
about being detail orientated
is that you have to see

40:21.221 --> 40:24.158
the big picture first
in order to see anything,

40:24.291 --> 40:25.893
in order to get
anything accomplished.

40:26.026 --> 40:27.327
Oh, look who it is.

40:27.528 --> 40:29.996
Are we a definite yes
on the festival, yet?

40:30.130 --> 40:31.832
Oh, I just have to
check my schedule.

40:31.964 --> 40:33.200
Long night?

40:35.935 --> 40:37.137
Excuse me?

40:37.337 --> 40:40.607
No, it's just
you seem a little...

40:40.741 --> 40:43.043
I guess I better
get back to my work.

40:43.177 --> 40:45.078
It looks like someone
needs the water.

40:49.116 --> 40:50.851
Sorry?

40:51.118 --> 40:54.288
First time guests get a complimentary
session in our mineral baths.

40:54.421 --> 40:57.524
Now they say the water here is
magical for a number of reasons.

40:57.658 --> 41:02.229
But first and foremost,
it's the perfect hangover cure.

41:10.970 --> 41:15.709
Yeah, that sulfur smell lets
you know it's the real deal.

41:15.843 --> 41:17.144
I mean, the pluto water company

41:17.344 --> 41:19.379
started pasteurizing
this stuff in the '30s

41:19.513 --> 41:21.048
to give it more of a shelf life.

41:21.181 --> 41:22.883
Some say that killed
the waters magic,

41:23.016 --> 41:26.553
but not this stuff, it is
straight from the spring.

41:34.695 --> 41:35.963
So what do you say?

41:36.096 --> 41:38.232
Ready for a rebirth of your own?

41:39.833 --> 41:41.368
Maybe some other time.

41:42.035 --> 41:44.505
Sure. Sure.

41:44.638 --> 41:46.773
The water's certainly
not going anywhere.

42:14.301 --> 42:17.437
What the fuck, man?
Still down here!

42:56.910 --> 42:58.245
Something nice about it.

42:58.845 --> 43:01.081
The past.

43:01.214 --> 43:02.983
Stick around long
enough you lose

43:03.116 --> 43:05.152
everything you ever loved...

43:06.820 --> 43:12.392
But the past is always
there fully intact.

43:13.061 --> 43:14.394
Perfect.

43:14.528 --> 43:18.066
Just waiting for
you to come home.

43:18.198 --> 43:20.200
Sorry, okay.

43:23.870 --> 43:25.990
Yeah, don't suppose I could
get you to say that again.

43:26.074 --> 43:28.241
- Could I?
- Why?

43:28.375 --> 43:30.410
I just want to separate
you from the wall.

43:30.544 --> 43:32.646
- Oh, um, I think we can make it work...
- No!

43:32.779 --> 43:34.881
And I wanted to make
sure I'm getting...

43:35.016 --> 43:37.784
I'm old, but I'm not stupid.

43:37.918 --> 43:40.587
You didn't come here
for local color.

43:40.721 --> 43:43.490
You wanna know about
Campbell Bradford.

43:46.526 --> 43:47.828
If you're not comfortable...

43:47.961 --> 43:49.396
That's fine.

43:49.596 --> 43:51.865
But you better get the lighting
exactly how you want it

43:51.999 --> 43:55.302
because I'm sure as hell
not say in any of this again.

43:56.269 --> 43:57.838
Fair enough.

43:58.039 --> 44:03.111
Campbell Bradford, hadn't
heard that name for a while.

44:03.243 --> 44:05.679
Doesn't seem to
fade away though.

44:05.812 --> 44:06.880
You knew him?

44:07.081 --> 44:09.916
Well, not personally.
My daddy did though.

44:10.051 --> 44:15.989
Talked about him like the
boogeyman or something worse.

44:16.124 --> 44:17.557
'Cause he was real.

44:17.691 --> 44:21.161
Why can't I find any info
about him or his family?

44:21.294 --> 44:23.997
The bradfords... the ones
around here anyway...

44:24.132 --> 44:29.137
Never could catch much luck
in the longevity department.

44:29.269 --> 44:33.874
Only one I can even think of
is his great-grandson...

44:34.008 --> 44:35.008
Josiah.

44:35.043 --> 44:36.043
We've met.

44:36.144 --> 44:37.411
Yeah.

44:38.712 --> 44:41.281
Kid's been a mess
his whole life,

44:41.415 --> 44:42.983
can't blame him, I guess.

44:43.117 --> 44:44.117
Considering...

44:44.184 --> 44:45.619
Considering what?

44:45.819 --> 44:48.622
Well, having a man like
Campbell in your line...

44:49.256 --> 44:50.490
Can't imagine.

44:50.624 --> 44:53.493
He made his name in blood.

44:53.627 --> 44:56.064
My daddy wouldn't even
look me in the eye

44:56.196 --> 44:57.397
when he'd talk about him.

44:57.531 --> 44:59.700
But he still talked about him.

45:00.734 --> 45:02.235
Why?

45:03.303 --> 45:08.275
Certain stories,
they just refuse to die.

45:09.342 --> 45:10.811
No one could touch him.

45:11.978 --> 45:14.848
Not the law, not anyone.

45:15.782 --> 45:17.751
He thought the town was his.

45:19.519 --> 45:21.722
Couldn't get the hotel though.

45:22.856 --> 45:25.559
The owner refused
to sell it to him.

45:27.694 --> 45:31.531
Didn't think Campbell was
worthy of a place so perfect.

45:31.665 --> 45:33.167
Special.

45:33.300 --> 45:35.169
So Campbell killed him,

45:35.302 --> 45:37.804
beat the owner to death

45:37.938 --> 45:40.640
right in front of
the man's only child.

45:40.774 --> 45:43.643
Then he just took the boy.

45:43.777 --> 45:46.080
Sheriff went looking
for him after that,

45:46.214 --> 45:48.749
but Campbell killed him too.

45:48.882 --> 45:53.820
Even had someone from the FBI
come down from Chicago.

45:53.954 --> 45:56.823
So Campbell finally
skipped town for good,

45:58.291 --> 46:01.028
right after burning him alive.

46:01.162 --> 46:04.865
Found that fed's body in a pile
of ash along the river bank,

46:04.998 --> 46:07.434
but all they ever
found of that child...

46:08.202 --> 46:09.803
Was his violin.

46:12.106 --> 46:13.774
You okay, dear?

46:14.741 --> 46:15.742
Mm-hmm.

46:17.844 --> 46:22.049
Suppose that's Campbell
Bradford in a nutshell.

46:22.183 --> 46:27.420
Kind of person so evil,
you get them in your head,

46:27.554 --> 46:30.258
you start seeing him everywhere.

46:30.423 --> 46:37.064
It's a miracle this hotel...
This town survived him at all.

46:37.964 --> 46:39.666
Maybe they didn't.

46:41.235 --> 46:42.569
What?

46:44.172 --> 46:48.742
Campbell's alive.
Barely, but I've met him.

46:50.111 --> 46:52.779
But that's not possible.

46:55.448 --> 46:59.953
The years and his age,
and it's not...

47:00.087 --> 47:02.789
- Okay, maybe we should take a little break.
- I've met him, Anne.

47:03.690 --> 47:06.693
He's with us for now.

47:13.967 --> 47:15.468
I really don't
mean to press here.

47:15.602 --> 47:18.272
I'd be careful, I were you.

47:18.405 --> 47:19.806
What do you mean by that?

47:19.940 --> 47:23.044
If you don't know
by now, you will.

47:24.045 --> 47:25.846
Maybe he's changed.

47:25.979 --> 47:30.218
- Changed?
- Maybe he found love for god, or...

47:30.350 --> 47:33.020
At my age, one of the only
things I know for sure

47:33.154 --> 47:37.191
is that people,
they don't change.

47:37.325 --> 47:40.660
Just become more of
what they really are.

47:48.269 --> 47:50.604
I get that, I do.

47:50.737 --> 47:53.406
I'm just asking you
to keep an open mind.

47:53.540 --> 47:55.109
Yeah, and I know that
it's your father,

47:55.309 --> 47:58.045
but you're the one who wanted to
know the truth about the story.

47:58.179 --> 48:00.348
You're the one who
wanted to know...

48:00.480 --> 48:03.284
No I understand, I'm not stupid.

48:03.416 --> 48:05.219
Of course.

48:05.353 --> 48:06.920
It's just... okay, all right.

48:07.054 --> 48:08.555
The people around here,

48:08.755 --> 48:11.858
when you mentioned the name
Campbell Bradford, they...

48:11.992 --> 48:13.872
I'm sure you were hoping
for a different version

48:13.927 --> 48:16.063
of this story, but this is it.
This is the...

48:16.197 --> 48:17.673
I'm telling you,
this is so much bigger

48:17.697 --> 48:19.633
than anything you can imagine.

48:21.302 --> 48:22.769
No, you're not hearing me.

48:22.969 --> 48:25.605
The most important thing is for
everybody to know the truth.

48:25.739 --> 48:27.841
That's the most important thing.

48:27.974 --> 48:29.576
And you could have
hired anybody.

48:29.709 --> 48:31.288
You could have hired some hack,
but you called me

48:31.312 --> 48:33.914
because you wanted...
You wanted to know...

48:35.182 --> 48:36.850
What?

48:37.118 --> 48:39.363
This woman. Okay, yeah.
So you're gonna come down here and what?

48:39.387 --> 48:41.322
You're going to rip
the camera out of my hands?

48:41.588 --> 48:44.392
No, I don't... honey, I don't give
a shit about the rest of the money.

48:44.524 --> 48:46.004
This is my story now, too.
And nobody,

48:46.060 --> 48:47.694
especially not some
north shore bitch,

48:47.827 --> 48:49.829
is gonna stop me from getting...

48:52.266 --> 48:54.567
Fucking entitled...

49:05.512 --> 49:08.049
That fuck has a
family in Chicago?

49:08.182 --> 49:09.462
I'm sorry, I should
have told you

49:09.616 --> 49:10.826
as soon as I knew who you were.

49:10.850 --> 49:13.720
- And he's still alive?
- Yeah.

49:13.853 --> 49:18.558
Yeah, he's got days left,
if that, but he's still...

49:19.759 --> 49:21.995
- Josiah...
- What's he like?

49:24.065 --> 49:25.632
He's...

49:25.765 --> 49:28.868
Old and frail and...

49:30.704 --> 49:32.539
Honestly, it's hard
to imagine him as...

49:32.672 --> 49:33.907
Pure evil?

49:34.808 --> 49:37.445
Yeah.

49:37.577 --> 49:41.449
This guy,
this piece of shit monster,

49:41.581 --> 49:43.550
he terrorizes this place
long before my time

49:43.683 --> 49:45.719
then he just bails.

49:45.852 --> 49:49.556
Starts over.
Pretends it didn't happen.

49:51.359 --> 49:53.893
Well, he fucked up
the whole lot of us

49:54.028 --> 49:55.738
like every branch of
the goddamn family tree

49:55.762 --> 49:57.931
was just snapped in half.

49:59.566 --> 50:01.801
And I'm the only one still here.

50:03.304 --> 50:04.871
Yeah. Why?

50:07.208 --> 50:09.010
The Campbell curse.

50:10.277 --> 50:13.014
They said that shit
like it was a joke.

50:14.415 --> 50:16.117
You know?

50:17.684 --> 50:19.762
Definitely wouldn't mind a few
minutes alone with the guy.

50:19.786 --> 50:23.391
Hop a bus to Chicago.
Tell him to fuck off.

50:23.556 --> 50:25.026
Maybe worse.

50:29.463 --> 50:33.367
At least he made a name
for himself though, right?

50:33.501 --> 50:35.461
Heard he almost bought
this place back in the day,

50:35.535 --> 50:39.773
and here I am fixin' it up
for ten bucks an hour.

50:41.308 --> 50:44.011
You don't think you're
worth more than that?

50:45.612 --> 50:47.181
Do you?

51:05.299 --> 51:07.401
Maybe you can.

51:07.535 --> 51:08.768
What?

51:09.537 --> 51:11.671
Tell him to fuck off.

51:20.214 --> 51:21.815
- You alright?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:21.948 --> 51:23.950
- You got this.
- Yeah.

51:25.852 --> 51:26.886
Be ready.

51:27.021 --> 51:28.588
You got somethin' prepared, or...

51:28.721 --> 51:30.291
Just be ready.

51:31.358 --> 51:32.460
Okay.

51:32.592 --> 51:34.295
Let's start with your name

51:34.428 --> 51:36.796
and how you're related
to Campbell Bradford.

51:36.930 --> 51:39.567
Uh, my name is, uh...

51:39.699 --> 51:41.135
Do... am I lookin' at the camera?

51:41.368 --> 51:45.805
Just look at me.
Just a conversation. Easy. Relax.

51:48.175 --> 51:50.743
My name is Josiah Bradford.

51:50.877 --> 51:55.182
Campbell was...
Is my great-grandfather.

51:55.316 --> 51:56.316
And how, would you say,

51:56.417 --> 51:58.486
is your relationship
with Campbell?

51:58.618 --> 52:00.564
Well, I've never... I mean, no, I never...
We already talked about...

52:00.588 --> 52:02.748
- I know. I just need it for context.
- Oh sorry, uh...

52:02.822 --> 52:05.368
- It's alright. How would you say
is your relationship with Campbell?

52:05.392 --> 52:07.061
Never met him.

52:07.194 --> 52:08.862
I mean, ran off
and left his wife

52:08.995 --> 52:10.964
and daughter
long before I was even...

52:13.666 --> 52:15.001
Is this even, I mean...

52:15.202 --> 52:17.002
They're not gonna wanna
hear me say this shit.

52:17.071 --> 52:18.281
Doesn't matter what they want.
What do you want to say?

52:18.305 --> 52:19.540
Why I... this doesn't really...

52:19.672 --> 52:20.940
- Say it.
- What are you...

52:21.075 --> 52:22.842
- Say it.
- Fuck him!

52:23.910 --> 52:27.248
Fuck Campbell Bradford.
How's that?

52:27.381 --> 52:28.382
- Why?
- Why?

52:28.516 --> 52:29.849
- Are you alright?
- What?

52:30.050 --> 52:32.553
- You seem a little...
- No, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

52:32.685 --> 52:34.321
I'm just, uh...

52:34.455 --> 52:37.558
- You know, a little weird with the camera.
- Is that it?

52:37.724 --> 52:39.926
Wha... what do you want?
I mean, I don't...

52:40.060 --> 52:41.937
I just... I do this for a living
so I can tell the difference

52:41.961 --> 52:43.140
between somebody
who's camera shy

52:43.164 --> 52:45.065
and somebody that's scared.

52:45.199 --> 52:46.966
The hell's that
supposed to mean?

52:47.101 --> 52:48.768
It means I think you're
scared of this man

52:49.036 --> 52:51.014
that you've never met,
and I'm curious as to why that would be.

52:51.038 --> 52:53.040
- I ain't scared of shit.
- Your hands are shaking.

52:53.174 --> 52:55.751
- Your voice has an unsettled quality about it.
- Erica, maybe we could keep...

52:55.775 --> 52:56.952
I don't know why
your body tenses up

52:56.976 --> 52:58.212
every time I say the words.

52:58.412 --> 53:00.847
- "Campbell Brad..."
- Because he killed them.

53:02.283 --> 53:04.951
- Killed who?
- Everyone.

53:08.088 --> 53:12.992
My mom, she od'd when I was
in high school. Sophomore year.

53:13.127 --> 53:14.827
Spring.

53:16.030 --> 53:18.765
It rained that day,
I remember that.

53:19.933 --> 53:22.303
Her mom, my grandma,
died that summer.

53:22.436 --> 53:23.637
It was an accident.

53:23.836 --> 53:25.972
Accidentally stepped
in front of a train.

53:26.106 --> 53:27.441
Who does that shit?

53:28.775 --> 53:30.477
Ugh, goddamn bradfords.

53:30.611 --> 53:31.844
An aunt I never met

53:32.046 --> 53:33.647
stole grandma's car
when she was like 12.

53:33.780 --> 53:34.914
Drove it off a bridge.

53:35.049 --> 53:37.418
You know, by mistake, of course.

53:37.551 --> 53:39.520
My mom's brother,
uncle Ross, funny as shit.

53:39.653 --> 53:42.323
Drunk as shit, too, choked
on his own vomit one night

53:42.456 --> 53:44.425
'bout 10 years ago.

53:44.558 --> 53:48.895
Yep, that shit really happens
not just to famous people.

53:49.029 --> 53:50.464
His two kids, both my cousins,

53:50.664 --> 53:52.375
got caught up in some shit
with the wrong people...

53:52.399 --> 53:54.319
Not that they were
the right people, necessarily,

53:54.401 --> 53:56.470
but never murdered
anyone as far as I know.

53:56.604 --> 53:59.906
Found one of 'em shot
dead in his living room.

54:00.040 --> 54:02.042
Other got his in prison.

54:05.579 --> 54:07.780
Alright, uh...

54:08.549 --> 54:09.717
Anyone else wanna smoke?

54:09.916 --> 54:11.652
I thought you said
Campbell killed 'em.

54:11.784 --> 54:13.187
Just me?

54:13.320 --> 54:16.390
Sounds like bad decisions
or bad luck maybe,

54:16.523 --> 54:18.325
but I don't know
if I would call it...

54:18.459 --> 54:20.227
I'm pretty sure you
can't smoke in here.

54:20.361 --> 54:21.695
Yeah, right.

54:21.894 --> 54:22.730
Um, right, I'm just
gonna step out...

54:22.862 --> 54:23.863
Does that comfort you?

54:23.997 --> 54:25.898
Excuse me?

54:26.033 --> 54:28.001
Putting your family's
mistakes and problems

54:28.135 --> 54:29.703
on a man you've never met,

54:29.836 --> 54:31.938
- is that fair?
- What the fuck is this?

54:32.072 --> 54:34.351
- No, no. I'm sorry...
- You know, this isn't what you said we were gonna be doing,

54:34.375 --> 54:36.176
acting like all
this shit is on me.

54:36.443 --> 54:37.920
- Turn the camera off.
- Let's just talk. No, we just wanna...

54:37.944 --> 54:40.114
- Turn that shit off.
- Alright. Yep.

54:41.081 --> 54:44.551
Okay, it's off. It's off.

54:46.020 --> 54:47.954
Shit, sorry. Um...

54:48.088 --> 54:49.408
Can we just talk,
just you and me?

54:49.590 --> 54:50.923
What the fuck
just happened here?

54:51.258 --> 54:54.994
I'm sorry. It... can you
please sit down so we...

54:55.129 --> 54:57.264
- You just want to talk?
- Yeah. Okay, so...

54:58.132 --> 55:00.367
These things can get heated,

55:00.501 --> 55:04.071
and it's easy to get
caught up in moments.

55:04.204 --> 55:07.074
And... but can I just tell you?

55:07.207 --> 55:10.044
Can I tell you how
brave I think you are?

55:10.177 --> 55:12.546
What you're doing right now.

55:12.680 --> 55:15.015
Listen, it's easy to
make me the bad guy

55:15.149 --> 55:17.084
and feel like i'm
pushing you in directions

55:17.217 --> 55:20.087
that you don't want to go,
but think... think about it.

55:20.220 --> 55:25.359
Think about where you were
going before I got here,

55:25.492 --> 55:28.928
before you were willing
to deal with this monster...

55:33.567 --> 55:35.803
And what he's done
to your family.

55:35.935 --> 55:37.438
Family's dead.

55:37.571 --> 55:41.175
But you're not.
You're still here.

55:43.344 --> 55:45.945
And you're gonna be alright.

55:47.047 --> 55:50.284
You're gonna fuckin'
survive this.

55:52.653 --> 55:54.764
Unless, of course, you keep
selling yourself this story

55:54.788 --> 55:56.523
that your family's cursed

55:56.657 --> 55:59.493
instead of taking
responsibility for your actions.

55:59.626 --> 56:01.395
"Campbell curse," is that
what you called it?

56:01.595 --> 56:04.231
I mean, it sounds more like
a Bradford problem to me.

56:10.137 --> 56:12.239
Bradford problems.

56:13.040 --> 56:15.209
- Yeah.
- I like that.

56:17.244 --> 56:18.788
It's like the whole
nature nurture thing.

56:18.812 --> 56:20.180
Are we born pieces of shit

56:20.381 --> 56:22.349
or do we pick that up
from our surroundings?

56:22.483 --> 56:24.017
I'm not trying to imply that...

56:24.218 --> 56:26.886
You're tryin' to say
I'm stuck here because of...

56:28.789 --> 56:30.691
Shit town,

56:30.824 --> 56:34.461
shit job... I ain't tryin'
to put that on Campbell.

56:36.929 --> 56:39.066
I fuck up.

56:39.199 --> 56:42.269
Yeah, secret's out.

56:44.004 --> 56:46.540
I could've found a girl.

56:46.673 --> 56:50.244
Had some good ones, but I always wanted
the others, the ones just out of reach.

56:50.377 --> 56:52.856
Could've learned a real trade,
make five times what I'm makin' now,

56:52.880 --> 56:55.358
but there's no way that I am gonna
look in the mirror every day,

56:55.382 --> 56:58.552
come to terms with
the fact that I'm just a...

56:58.685 --> 57:00.020
Plumber...

57:00.888 --> 57:02.156
Mechanic.

57:04.825 --> 57:07.194
I didn't quit that blastin' job.
They fired my ass.

57:07.327 --> 57:11.465
Real professional discourtesy,
if you ask me.

57:11.598 --> 57:13.998
You see, I kept stealin' materials,
takin' 'em home at night.

57:14.034 --> 57:15.836
I wanted to try out some
more innovative ways

57:15.968 --> 57:20.073
of turnin' walls into rubble,
force of god damn nature.

57:21.008 --> 57:23.677
You rig that shit just right,

57:23.811 --> 57:25.712
one call from one of these,

57:25.846 --> 57:28.816
that's all you need to take
down an entire building.

57:28.948 --> 57:30.950
That's right.

57:31.084 --> 57:32.395
I can do more damage
with this phone

57:32.419 --> 57:34.054
than a full demolition crew.

57:34.188 --> 57:36.256
So how am I supposed
to sit there

57:36.390 --> 57:38.926
with some old ass detonator,
goggles, hard hat and shit,

57:39.059 --> 57:43.130
some goddamn grunt when I know
there's a better way?

57:44.898 --> 57:47.701
You know what that's like?

57:47.835 --> 57:52.706
Feelin' greatness in your
bones, getting so close...

57:54.508 --> 57:57.010
Knowin' it's right there...

57:58.412 --> 58:00.747
Knowin' damn well
you deserve it.

58:09.690 --> 58:11.592
So, yeah...

58:11.725 --> 58:14.161
Ain't tryin' to blame
my "Bradford problems"

58:14.294 --> 58:16.129
on anyone but me.

58:20.701 --> 58:22.102
But the curse...

58:24.538 --> 58:27.941
Campbell's only real
gift to the family,

58:28.075 --> 58:29.676
well that's in the blood.

58:30.444 --> 58:32.279
What?

58:32.846 --> 58:34.548
Death.

58:36.083 --> 58:41.054
When you have it runnin'
through you, you just know.

58:49.863 --> 58:51.398
What the fuck?

58:51.532 --> 58:52.766
Josiah.

58:55.202 --> 58:56.803
Josiah.

58:58.872 --> 59:00.641
Josiah.

59:06.813 --> 59:07.848
What, uh...

59:07.981 --> 59:09.221
If you need a moment, we can...

59:09.349 --> 59:10.984
Uh.

59:11.118 --> 59:12.352
Josiah.

59:14.087 --> 59:15.389
Uh, what...

59:16.189 --> 59:17.925
What just happened?

59:18.091 --> 59:19.793
Put that on the laptop.

59:19.927 --> 59:21.662
Uh. Okay, but didn't
that seem a little...

59:21.795 --> 59:23.597
You wanted to know
how this was done.

59:23.730 --> 59:26.433
You wanted to know how
I make something beautiful.

59:26.567 --> 59:30.370
You want in on the process?
This is how it's done.

59:30.504 --> 59:32.306
Let me know when
you're finished.

1:00:30.664 --> 1:00:32.833
His daddy should have
sold me that hotel

1:00:32.966 --> 1:00:34.935
when he had the chance.

1:00:35.069 --> 1:00:38.905
They say if you ain't
built for greatness...

1:00:40.574 --> 1:00:43.176
You best not mess with it.

1:01:33.627 --> 1:01:35.262
Hello?

1:01:41.401 --> 1:01:42.969
Someone in here?

1:02:13.134 --> 1:02:15.335
Ain't no curse.

1:02:16.104 --> 1:02:17.504
That's a gift.

1:02:20.074 --> 1:02:21.942
Who the fuck are you?

1:02:23.443 --> 1:02:25.946
Oh, you know...

1:02:35.989 --> 1:02:37.657
My blood.

1:02:38.792 --> 1:02:39.993
My name.

1:02:42.662 --> 1:02:44.765
Only good things you have.

1:02:47.135 --> 1:02:49.836
You can't run from what you are.

1:02:52.472 --> 1:02:55.809
You sure as hell
can't run from me.

1:02:58.478 --> 1:02:59.946
Campbell?

1:03:03.517 --> 1:03:04.818
Who are you?

1:03:45.425 --> 1:03:46.726
We need to talk.

1:03:49.896 --> 1:03:52.766
<i>Holy shit. He speaks.</i>

1:03:52.899 --> 1:03:54.501
<i>Pardon my a...</i>

1:03:54.634 --> 1:03:56.170
<i>Why don't you tell
me about the town?</i>

1:03:56.304 --> 1:03:58.438
<i>West baden, is it?</i>

1:03:58.572 --> 1:04:02.109
<i>Hmm, why would you
want to disappear?</i>

1:04:04.078 --> 1:04:06.047
<i>Can we go back?
I'm a little confused,</i>

1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:08.682
<i>why would you be hiding?</i>

1:04:09.983 --> 1:04:13.353
- I don't understand what...
- Oh, it gets better.

1:04:15.488 --> 1:04:17.024
<i>What about this?</i>

1:04:18.425 --> 1:04:20.360
<i>Does this mean anything to you?</i>

1:04:23.463 --> 1:04:25.166
<i>Whose name?</i>

1:04:25.299 --> 1:04:27.868
<i>Well, your daughter
gave it to me, she...</i>

1:04:28.001 --> 1:04:31.705
I can't tell if you're
crazy or full of shit.

1:04:33.241 --> 1:04:34.474
Kellyn.

1:04:34.674 --> 1:04:36.810
I kinda have my money
on both right now.

1:04:38.145 --> 1:04:40.881
Yeah.

1:04:42.749 --> 1:04:44.618
Ever since I started
drinking the water...

1:04:44.751 --> 1:04:46.453
- The what?
- The water in that bottle

1:04:46.586 --> 1:04:47.998
that I got from
the woman who hired me.

1:04:48.022 --> 1:04:50.057
- Jesus Christ.
- It's been strange.

1:04:50.191 --> 1:04:52.293
It's different than
the usual glimpse

1:04:52.459 --> 1:04:53.760
from the past that I get.

1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:55.205
It's like every
time I take a drink,

1:04:55.229 --> 1:04:57.464
the past comes here to me.

1:04:57.597 --> 1:04:59.233
- It's...
- It's probably giardia.

1:04:59.367 --> 1:05:03.271
No, it's not. This is what
we've been working toward.

1:05:03.403 --> 1:05:06.073
No. No.

1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:09.110
God, look at you.

1:05:09.243 --> 1:05:11.778
We are so close to finding out
about Campbell.

1:05:11.912 --> 1:05:13.713
All we need is one last piece,

1:05:13.914 --> 1:05:15.892
that perfect image is just
gonna tie everything together.

1:05:15.916 --> 1:05:17.627
That's what we need. We just
need a little more time.

1:05:17.651 --> 1:05:19.853
Hey, this is real. This is...

1:05:19.986 --> 1:05:22.923
If I'm crazy right now then
everything I've ever done,

1:05:23.057 --> 1:05:24.925
all the work that...
That changed your life,

1:05:25.059 --> 1:05:28.828
all the work that you love
then that's all bullshit too.

1:05:28.962 --> 1:05:31.299
- Never meet your heroes.
- Oh, come on! Come on!

1:05:32.599 --> 1:05:33.799
Okay, people always talk about

1:05:33.967 --> 1:05:36.103
the darkness
in your films, Erica.

1:05:36.237 --> 1:05:39.340
This bleak, violent horror shit.

1:05:39.472 --> 1:05:43.110
It was never the darkness
that drew me in, though.

1:05:43.244 --> 1:05:45.413
God, I had enough of that
in my day to day already.

1:05:45.545 --> 1:05:49.417
The shit I'd seen, I probably
could've been one of your subjects...

1:05:49.549 --> 1:05:51.152
No.

1:05:51.285 --> 1:05:52.652
No, it wasn't the darkness,

1:05:52.852 --> 1:05:56.390
it was how you made
your way through it.

1:05:56.523 --> 1:05:58.092
You stood in the middle

1:05:58.225 --> 1:05:59.926
of some of the most
fucked up lives,

1:06:00.061 --> 1:06:03.897
and you refused to
look away, to even blink.

1:06:05.032 --> 1:06:06.499
You showed me
something that I knew,

1:06:06.633 --> 1:06:09.236
but I couldn't see myself.

1:06:10.770 --> 1:06:12.206
Your work...

1:06:13.407 --> 1:06:15.709
It didn't change my life...

1:06:17.477 --> 1:06:19.879
- It saved it.
- Well good...

1:06:20.014 --> 1:06:23.026
Okay, with all due respect to your process
or whatever, I think you need to go

1:06:23.050 --> 1:06:24.627
- find someone to talk...
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

1:06:24.651 --> 1:06:26.029
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't!

1:06:26.053 --> 1:06:27.613
Something horrible
is gonna happen here.

1:06:27.921 --> 1:06:29.565
- How can you possibly know that?
- Lonnie wilkes.

1:06:29.589 --> 1:06:31.269
What? What the hell are
you even talking...

1:06:31.359 --> 1:06:33.569
The whole time I was working with
him, I knew people were gonna die,

1:06:33.593 --> 1:06:35.372
- and I never did anything...
- Okay, you got played by a sociopath.

1:06:35.396 --> 1:06:37.564
- You cannot carry that...
- I knew that he was guilty.

1:06:42.769 --> 1:06:44.047
I mean, face to face,
I bought it

1:06:44.071 --> 1:06:46.506
like everybody else did, but...

1:06:46.639 --> 1:06:48.942
But every so often,
I would see it.

1:06:50.510 --> 1:06:52.346
He played the part.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:53.780
But I knew.

1:06:55.483 --> 1:06:57.751
I knew exactly what he was.

1:07:00.221 --> 1:07:01.788
And, um...

1:07:03.623 --> 1:07:04.891
It...

1:07:08.129 --> 1:07:13.401
It just... it just worked
better if he didn't do it.

1:07:13.533 --> 1:07:18.738
My involvement, the way
the film made real-life change.

1:07:20.307 --> 1:07:22.076
That was the story.

1:07:24.512 --> 1:07:27.481
But his family, his...

1:07:27.614 --> 1:07:29.916
I know, I know, I know.

1:07:35.389 --> 1:07:36.923
I know.

1:07:37.058 --> 1:07:41.062
I know people died because
I walked away from the truth.

1:07:43.930 --> 1:07:46.766
I can't ever do that again.

1:07:46.900 --> 1:07:50.304
That's why I can't
ever do that again.

1:07:51.704 --> 1:07:55.009
Unless it makes for
a better ending, right?

1:07:58.479 --> 1:08:02.349
Do you really think you would've
done something different?

1:08:02.483 --> 1:08:04.884
If... if you were that
close to something

1:08:05.019 --> 1:08:07.787
you've wanted your whole life?

1:08:07.921 --> 1:08:09.923
You could taste it.

1:08:11.292 --> 1:08:14.661
You really think you'd be
able to do the right thing?

1:08:17.431 --> 1:08:18.832
No.

1:08:22.602 --> 1:08:24.838
That's why I am leaving.

1:09:56.430 --> 1:09:58.032
No!

1:10:03.537 --> 1:10:04.938
Oh!

1:10:15.949 --> 1:10:17.518
You want to know about me?

1:10:19.687 --> 1:10:21.088
Now you know.

1:10:27.561 --> 1:10:29.263
You brought me here.

1:10:30.930 --> 1:10:32.732
You did this.

1:11:05.832 --> 1:11:07.101
Erica?

1:11:07.735 --> 1:11:09.236
Erica?

1:11:09.370 --> 1:11:11.904
Hey. Erica.

1:11:12.039 --> 1:11:14.074
Wha... what the hell
are you doing?

1:11:14.208 --> 1:11:16.809
- He's here, he's here.
- Who's here?

1:12:44.631 --> 1:12:46.166
Out cold.

1:12:46.300 --> 1:12:50.404
Shame she'll be missing
tonight's festivities.

1:12:50.537 --> 1:12:52.206
The rebirth thing?

1:12:53.307 --> 1:12:55.309
Sounds like some bullshit to me.

1:12:55.442 --> 1:12:58.145
If you lived here,
you'd understand.

1:12:58.278 --> 1:13:01.115
Yeah, if I lived here,
I'd leave.

1:13:02.882 --> 1:13:04.551
Sorry, I...

1:13:04.685 --> 1:13:06.986
I know you...

1:13:07.121 --> 1:13:09.590
Just something about this place.

1:13:09.723 --> 1:13:12.359
Somethin' about every place.

1:13:12.493 --> 1:13:15.362
But you didn't see
her last night.

1:13:15.496 --> 1:13:19.099
I mean, either she's
completely lost it or...

1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:21.000
Or what?

1:13:24.671 --> 1:13:26.507
She says he's here now.

1:13:28.308 --> 1:13:29.510
Who?

1:13:34.947 --> 1:13:36.216
Oh.

1:13:42.856 --> 1:13:44.558
Just tell me that she's crazy,

1:13:44.691 --> 1:13:48.928
that I'm crazy for even
thinkin' that this is actually,

1:13:49.062 --> 1:13:51.198
you know...

1:13:51.331 --> 1:13:54.034
- What do you see?
- What?

1:13:54.168 --> 1:13:56.503
Well, look around.
What do you see?

1:13:57.404 --> 1:14:00.340
- What are you...
- Go on. Do it.

1:14:05.612 --> 1:14:07.014
I see a...

1:14:08.048 --> 1:14:09.883
A building.

1:14:10.017 --> 1:14:11.518
A building.

1:14:15.556 --> 1:14:17.191
People...

1:14:17.324 --> 1:14:19.693
Getting ready for a party.

1:14:21.161 --> 1:14:24.198
Little-ass sandwiches on trays.

1:14:25.732 --> 1:14:27.092
What exactly am I
supposed to be...

1:14:27.134 --> 1:14:28.869
I see a town...

1:14:29.001 --> 1:14:31.605
Refusing to let anything...

1:14:31.738 --> 1:14:32.972
Anyone...

1:14:33.106 --> 1:14:34.608
Keep it down.

1:14:39.046 --> 1:14:41.348
What do you think she sees?

1:14:50.958 --> 1:14:54.061
So, which one of us is right?

1:15:15.949 --> 1:15:17.885
Hi, how are you?

1:15:18.018 --> 1:15:19.019
Yes. Hey guys!

1:15:19.152 --> 1:15:20.854
Hey guys, don't worry, you...

1:15:20.988 --> 1:15:22.055
It's 10 after, let's go.

1:15:45.445 --> 1:15:47.247
From the ashes!

1:15:47.381 --> 1:15:49.716
From the ashes!

1:16:22.549 --> 1:16:23.617
Erica?

1:16:31.558 --> 1:16:32.759
Erica?

1:17:42.096 --> 1:17:43.864
Oh, Jesus!

1:17:43.997 --> 1:17:47.234
You can't just sneak
up on a person like...

1:17:54.108 --> 1:17:57.778
Oh, glad to see you decided
to join us this evening.

1:17:57.911 --> 1:18:00.881
This is a fun interpretation
of "formal attire."

1:18:01.015 --> 1:18:01.882
Uh, have you seen Erica?

1:18:02.016 --> 1:18:03.283
Miss Shaw?

1:18:03.483 --> 1:18:04.985
No, not since
last night's incident.

1:18:05.119 --> 1:18:07.521
Not everyone takes to
the water, I suppose,

1:18:07.654 --> 1:18:09.894
- but I really thought...
- The water, the fucking water.

1:18:09.990 --> 1:18:12.359
No, no! The pool is
closed for the festival!

1:18:12.492 --> 1:18:15.195
You probably
shouldn't go in there!

1:19:53.293 --> 1:19:57.497
They'll all be dead before
you get 'em to stop dancin'.

1:20:06.007 --> 1:20:07.074
Run now.

1:20:08.608 --> 1:20:10.777
You'll probably make it out.

1:23:18.999 --> 1:23:20.201
Kellyn?

1:23:21.501 --> 1:23:23.137
You really believe
all that shit?

1:23:24.004 --> 1:23:25.172
What?

1:23:25.306 --> 1:23:29.143
Campbell and everything...
That he actually...

1:23:30.444 --> 1:23:32.912
- What happened with Josiah...
- Yeah, I do.

1:23:34.714 --> 1:23:39.153
- I mean, what you think?
- I don't think that you can just become a monster...

1:23:39.286 --> 1:23:42.655
Not without having some of
that in you to begin with.

1:23:44.358 --> 1:23:46.726
- Well, Josiah was...
- Give me the phone, Erica.

1:23:47.827 --> 1:23:49.363
- What?
- Josiah's phone.

1:23:49.497 --> 1:23:51.032
Please.

1:23:54.201 --> 1:23:55.511
Why? What does this
have to do with...

1:23:55.535 --> 1:23:57.204
Give me the phone!

1:24:03.110 --> 1:24:05.112
Listen...

1:24:05.246 --> 1:24:07.214
I have the camera
set up outside.

1:24:07.348 --> 1:24:08.648
It's just one shot,

1:24:08.848 --> 1:24:10.227
but it's one big wide shot
of the whole place.

1:24:10.251 --> 1:24:12.153
And I really think
we should get it

1:24:12.286 --> 1:24:13.887
before we ruin these
people's festival.

1:24:14.021 --> 1:24:15.581
I mean, my god,
it's gonna be local news

1:24:15.655 --> 1:24:17.391
and cops and it's just...

1:24:17.624 --> 1:24:19.369
It's kind of hard to keep the music
going after something like this.

1:24:19.393 --> 1:24:21.628
I really think it's
a shot I've been...

1:24:21.761 --> 1:24:24.231
We've been trying to...

1:24:25.832 --> 1:24:27.667
I really think
we have something here.

1:24:31.205 --> 1:24:32.273
I know.

1:24:32.473 --> 1:24:33.549
I know we've been through hell.

1:24:33.573 --> 1:24:36.444
We've been through hell here.

1:24:36.576 --> 1:24:37.777
Just trust me, please.

1:24:37.977 --> 1:24:41.148
Can you just trust me?
Just this once.

1:24:46.586 --> 1:24:48.055
It's gonna be okay.

1:24:49.622 --> 1:24:50.890
Alright.

1:24:52.493 --> 1:24:54.395
Just imagine the story
we'll have to tell

1:24:54.528 --> 1:24:55.728
once this whole thing is over.

1:25:37.937 --> 1:25:39.939
<i>Your mine now, boy.</i>

1:25:41.342 --> 1:25:45.112
<i>But you will never have my blood</i>

1:25:45.246 --> 1:25:48.182
<i>or my name.</i>
