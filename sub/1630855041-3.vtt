00:39.206 --> 00:42.084
<i>Being wanted is nice</i>

00:42.084 --> 00:46.046
<i>Well, unless it comes with a price</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:51.510
<i>Josh escaped on the bus
A mistake? Please discuss</i>

00:51.510 --> 00:54.680
<i>And Melissa's found a clue</i>

00:55.264 --> 00:58.976
<i>Scoob-a-dee-doo</i>

01:00.853 --> 01:02.312
Bobby, guess what?

01:02.312 --> 01:05.022
I found Elsie's datebook.
The dead showgirl.

01:05.022 --> 01:08.068
Yeah. I found it in her dressing room
after you told me to snoop around.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.071
Anyway, she wrote
a street address down in her datebook.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.074
Should I go to the address?
I should go to the address, right?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.701
Maybe take a look at this first.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.370
Wait. Why is he wanted?

01:18.370 --> 01:20.831
Your lover, my client, "Josh" for short,

01:20.831 --> 01:24.751
has decided to add a few hurdles to
my agility course by breaking out of jail.

01:24.751 --> 01:28.755
What? Why would he do that?
Where is he? Can you find him?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.507
There's very little I can't do.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.802
Besides bore people or look bad
in literally any kind of suit.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.680
Don't worry. I'll track him down
before the trial tomorrow.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.559
Oh, no. Are you emotional,
or do you have something contagious?

01:40.559 --> 01:41.852
I'd prefer the latter.

01:41.852 --> 01:42.895
I'm sorry.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.857
Here, here.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.693
I mean-- There, there.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.363
I'm not the best at consolation.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.074
I was raised by
cold birthday check writers.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.952
Just-- Everything has been such
a struggle the past couple years.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.164
And now we're here, and now this.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.583
I feel like I should
say something comforting here.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.794
But the truth is, your hubby really
hurt himself with this bonehead jailbreak.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.713
Obviously, I'm a human miracle,

02:09.713 --> 02:12.257
but now it's gonna be a lot harder for me
to get him exonerated.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.593
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

02:14.593 --> 02:19.473
There is. Follow that clue. Find the
real killer. It may be his only chance.

02:19.473 --> 02:23.185
I'll do my best.
I just-- I really hope Josh is okay.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.983
Good morning, Josh-shine.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.860
Fresh juice? Beads?

02:31.860 --> 02:32.986
Flowers for your hair?

02:33.987 --> 02:34.988
My hair?

02:37.533 --> 02:40.953
Oh, my God.
I've had recurring dreams about this.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.664
What year is this supposed to be?

02:44.414 --> 02:45.707
Where am I?

02:46.291 --> 02:48.710
Wait, is this a junkyard?

02:48.710 --> 02:51.505
One man's junkyard
is another man's utopia.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.589
Topher?

02:52.589 --> 02:57.469
Welcome, Josh, to our commune,
our gathering place, our group home.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.680
Yeah, my grandma died in one of those.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.559
So what is going on?
Are we safe here? Are the cops after us?

03:03.559 --> 03:05.686
Man, the cops are always after us.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.896
The profession attracts
and rewards bullies.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.189
You seem worried, Josh.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.234
Aren't you? We broke out of jail.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.861
Melissa's probably freaking out.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.154
It makes me look guilty as hell.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.282
What was I thinking getting on that bus?

03:18.282 --> 03:23.328
I'm getting the vibe that you feel
burdened, Josh. By a lot. Is that true?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.001
To be honest, yes.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.880
Life has been kinda hard lately.
At work, at home.

03:33.922 --> 03:37.301
Josh, you are hung up,
strung out, wound up.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.637
You need to turn on,
tune in, and drop out.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.515
It's time for a tribal initiation.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.517
No, thank you.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.520
- I'm not really much of a joiner.
- Don't worry.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.773
It's just a celebration
of being alive and being together.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.400
Could you be more specific?

03:53.400 --> 03:57.696
<i>Flooby wabba noody
Rizzo, Cha Cha, Doody</i>

03:57.696 --> 04:03.076
<i>Flooby nooby wicky
Zuko 'n Kenickie</i>

04:03.076 --> 04:07.206
<i>Join in the cosmic cantata</i>

04:07.915 --> 04:11.793
<i>Open your soul to a world that's new</i>

04:11.793 --> 04:17.216
<i>It's time to revel in the revelation
Pay tribute to the tribulation</i>

04:17.216 --> 04:20.052
<i>The universe believes in you</i>

04:20.052 --> 04:22.179
- And we do too!
- Great, but--

04:22.179 --> 04:26.266
<i>There's poverty, war, and injustice</i>

04:26.767 --> 04:30.896
<i>Bigotry, hatred, and greed and fear</i>

04:30.896 --> 04:36.068
<i>Too many people dying in the street
Fighting for a bite to eat</i>

04:36.068 --> 04:39.238
<i>The answer is crystal clear</i>

04:39.238 --> 04:40.447
So lend an ear!

04:41.406 --> 04:45.452
<i>Everyone's gotta get naked</i>

04:45.452 --> 04:48.997
- I'm sorry. What now?
- <i>Get back to the way we were born</i>

04:48.997 --> 04:50.749
This is mandatory?

04:50.749 --> 04:55.420
<i>The only solution
A love revolution</i>

04:55.420 --> 04:57.130
<i>Let's get back to the way</i>

04:57.714 --> 04:59.049
<i>Back to the day</i>

04:59.633 --> 05:01.927
<i>Back to the way we were born</i>

05:01.927 --> 05:04.304
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta get naked</i>

05:04.304 --> 05:07.349
<i>We're all taking our clothes off</i>

05:07.891 --> 05:10.769
<i>Every single one of us</i>

05:11.353 --> 05:14.857
<i>But what if we're good
With our clothes on?</i>

05:15.941 --> 05:19.903
<i>You'd make an exception then, no doubt</i>

05:19.903 --> 05:23.115
<i>No!
It's time for every chick and dude</i>

05:23.115 --> 05:25.576
- <i>To get a nude attitude</i>
- <i>Get a nude attitude</i>

05:25.576 --> 05:28.704
- <i>We're gonna let it all hang out</i>
- <i>Let it all hang out</i>

05:28.704 --> 05:30.831
- Even our wieners!
- What?

05:30.831 --> 05:35.586
- <i>Everyone's gotta get naked</i>
- <i>Ooh wah, we're getting naked</i>

05:35.586 --> 05:38.005
- <i>Get back to the way we were born</i>
- <i>Ooh, ooh wah</i>

05:38.005 --> 05:40.424
<i>Back to the day we were born</i>

05:40.424 --> 05:42.050
- <i>The only solution</i>
- Or not.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.720
<i>A love revolution</i>

05:44.720 --> 05:46.805
<i>Let's get back to the way</i>

05:46.805 --> 05:48.182
<i>Back to the day</i>

05:48.765 --> 05:51.685
<i>Back to the way we were born</i>

05:51.685 --> 05:54.730
Hey. What if we meet in
the middle and say clothing optional?

05:55.230 --> 05:59.234
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta get naked</i>

05:59.234 --> 06:03.280
- <i>Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get naked</i>
- <i>Oh, flowers don't wear pants</i>

06:03.280 --> 06:07.201
- <i>Gotta get naked</i>
- <i>So why should we? Why should we?</i>

06:07.201 --> 06:09.328
- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
- <i>Gotta get naked</i>

06:09.328 --> 06:11.413
<i>Gotta get naked</i>

06:11.413 --> 06:13.207
No.

06:16.919 --> 06:20.005
I'm seeing a lot of moles
I'm worried about.

06:22.591 --> 06:26.303
Welcome to Quick Street.
The seedier side of Schmicago.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.388
Home to scoundrels, wastrels,

06:28.388 --> 06:31.850
and the occasional nosy bitch
who can't mind her own business.

06:36.647 --> 06:40.817
Off with ya, chatterin' vermin.
Can't you keep yourselves occupied?

06:42.194 --> 06:44.571
But we want to learn how to spell and add.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.032
Yeah? Well, I want massive knockers

06:47.032 --> 06:50.619
and to fill up me tub with French
soap bubbles instead of bathtub gin,

06:50.619 --> 06:54.331
but we ain't the steerers of the ship,
is we?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.542
- Hey!
- Wow.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.211
Very different, yet somehow still mean.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.047
Hi there. I'm looking for--

07:02.047 --> 07:03.131
<i>Good day, miss</i>

07:03.131 --> 07:04.633
<i>Lookin' pretty
Lookin' lonely</i>

07:04.633 --> 07:08.512
<i>Looks like you could use a child
Or two, or three</i>

07:08.512 --> 07:10.013
<i>For a very modest fee</i>

07:10.013 --> 07:13.517
<i>If by any chance you're searchin'
For an urchin</i>

07:13.517 --> 07:17.145
<i>I've got your merchandise right here
But I'll be clear</i>

07:17.145 --> 07:19.565
<i>Tell you straight
They're not great</i>

07:19.565 --> 07:24.611
<i>And they don't appreciate
They're possibly the worst brats in town</i>

07:24.611 --> 07:26.905
So, you're selling the orphans?

07:26.905 --> 07:28.407
<i>And me</i>

07:28.907 --> 07:31.618
<i>I'm just a woman with needs of me own</i>

07:31.618 --> 07:34.288
<i>Who'd like to do some misdeeds of me own</i>

07:34.288 --> 07:37.207
<i>With a certain someone</i>

07:38.333 --> 07:42.546
<i>But though I am
A woman who's never enjoyed</i>

07:42.546 --> 07:44.923
<i>That thing what as
A mother gets you employed</i>

07:44.923 --> 07:48.010
<i>Somehow I seem to have become one</i>

07:48.010 --> 07:50.679
<i>And I'm surrounded by these lambs
Little tykes</i>

07:50.679 --> 07:53.307
<i>Girls with dolls
Little boys with little balls</i>

07:53.307 --> 07:54.766
<i>How I love these darling tots</i>

07:54.766 --> 07:56.935
<i>Precious imps
Take a glimpse</i>

07:57.519 --> 07:58.854
<i>Truth is I got lots and lots</i>

07:58.854 --> 08:00.981
<i>Oh, sure
This one here may have some lice</i>

08:00.981 --> 08:03.483
<i>This one plays dice
This one eats mice</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:05.444
<i>Caught him twice Thrice</i>

08:05.444 --> 08:08.739
<i>Truth is they're not very nice</i>

08:08.739 --> 08:11.325
<i>Not at all worth the price</i>

08:11.325 --> 08:14.870
<i>So if you take my advice</i>

08:14.870 --> 08:21.919
<i>You'll stay away from
The worst brats in town</i>

08:23.462 --> 08:26.632
Yes. I'm sorry.
I'm not here for an orphan.

08:26.632 --> 08:30.385
Are you sure? Because at your age,
it's either cats or plants,

08:30.385 --> 08:33.263
and neither of them
will take care of you when you're dying.

08:35.140 --> 08:39.019
No, I'm looking for this address:
17 Quick Street.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.230
Course you are.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.815
It's where someone very special lives.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.692
Someone very nice.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.319
Dooley Blight, the butcher.

08:48.487 --> 08:52.866
He could portion my skirt steak any day.
That's his shop right there.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.785
Just don't you try anything.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.371
If you do, I'll wring your neck
till you breathe no more.

08:58.789 --> 08:59.790
I'm joking.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.755
Yes, well, thank you.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.299
I hate me lot in life.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.680
And, Josh, with the completion
of this smiley face upon thy cheek,

09:15.264 --> 09:16.807
you are now officially in the tribe.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.478
- Groovy.
- Is something wrong?

09:21.478 --> 09:23.397
I could try painting it again.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.024
- Can never get the eyes right.
- No. I just--

09:26.608 --> 09:29.486
This whole scene with the face painting,
and the getting naked,

09:29.486 --> 09:33.907
and the closeness to other humans,
it's not really my thing.

09:33.907 --> 09:38.328
Our tribe is about more than just that,
Josh. We also fight social injustice.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.456
Like taking on Octavius Kratt
and his evil power company.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.624
Boo!

09:42.624 --> 09:45.294
- Octavius Kratt?
- He's bad news.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.296
- Polluting the environment.
- Man!

09:47.296 --> 09:49.882
Subjecting his employees
to horrible working conditions.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.091
- Cold!
- Okay.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.509
Paying pennies while he lives like a king.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.844
Busted!

09:53.844 --> 09:55.929
But it's never easy trying
to fight the power, Josh.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.891
We have been getting naked
and telling parables for months,

09:58.891 --> 10:01.518
but for some reason, nothing has changed.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.730
Well, there's probably more effective ways
to protest.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.442
Sounds like someone needs
a lesson in the power of parables.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.986
- I assure you, I do not.
- And the value of community.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.489
- The lamb.
- Yay!

10:15.699 --> 10:18.785
The lamb! The lamb!
The lamb without a flock!

10:18.785 --> 10:20.746
- What's happening right now?
- The lamb! The lamb!

10:20.746 --> 10:22.080
The lamb without a flock!

10:22.080 --> 10:25.250
- The lamb! The lamb without a flock!
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.419
There once was a little lamb...

10:29.796 --> 10:33.300
who was caged away from other sheep
by a cruel shepherd.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.681
I do not want to be alone.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.725
Oh, no. I already hate this.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.018
Then one day,

10:43.018 --> 10:46.146
a kind shepherd happened to cross
this lonely lamb and took pity on him.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.692
The kind shepherd invited
the lonely lamb back to his flock.

10:50.692 --> 10:54.530
Lambie, I think this is
the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.573
- Okay.
- But soon,

10:56.573 --> 10:59.368
the cruel shepherd
realized his lamb was missing.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.372
One hippopotamus, two hippopotamus--

11:03.372 --> 11:05.415
Hey! Wait a minute.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.712
Meanwhile, the lonely lamb
was thriving amongst his new flock.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.923
Made it, Ma! Top of the world!

11:12.923 --> 11:16.009
So, when the cruel shepherd came
to collect his missing ward,

11:16.009 --> 11:17.386
the kind shepherd said to him...

11:17.970 --> 11:19.429
You're out!

11:20.097 --> 11:22.766
And so, as the little lamb decided
to stay with his new flock,

11:22.766 --> 11:27.604
a lesson was learned about the power
and joy to be found in community.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.815
You're a good man, see?

11:29.815 --> 11:33.110
Is that a crook in your pocket
or are you just happy to herd me?

11:33.110 --> 11:35.696
Now that's
the most ridiculous parable I ever heard.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.033
Well, now I'm gonna blow my brains out.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.620
So, what'd you think?

11:44.872 --> 11:45.873
You really did it.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.333
So much energy.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.961
- The impressions...
- Yeah?

11:50.961 --> 11:53.505
...truly in the ballpark.

11:54.798 --> 11:58.260
But, to be honest,
I'm actually more concerned about Melissa.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.971
I mean, she's gotta be worried about me,
if I'm okay.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.307
You guys are great,
but I gotta go find her.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.766
Josh.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.686
You're a wanted man.
You can't go anywhere.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.440
Let's let one of the tribe seek her out
and deliver the good news.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.525
- Alex.
- Oh, happy day!

12:13.525 --> 12:15.903
Everything is gonna be all right, man.

12:16.528 --> 12:19.448
And I've got the perfect way
to lift your spirits.

12:20.324 --> 12:22.451
Who wants to get naked again?

12:32.878 --> 12:33.712
Hello.

12:35.631 --> 12:36.465
You don't know me.

12:36.465 --> 12:40.093
Although, well, I kind of know you--
Or another version of you.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.638
<i>Morning, ma'am
Feeling hungry?</i>

12:42.638 --> 12:44.139
- <i>Want a sausage?</i>
- No.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.434
<i>Can I offer you a link?
Or two? Or three?</i>

12:48.393 --> 12:49.561
<i>For a very modest fee</i>

12:49.561 --> 12:53.315
<i>I confess it's mostly filler
From the miller</i>

12:53.315 --> 12:55.817
<i>Not much to grill or bake or fry</i>

12:56.568 --> 12:58.654
<i>Wonder why
It's my supply</i>

12:58.654 --> 13:00.531
<i>The meat they mete out's tough and dry</i>

13:00.531 --> 13:06.912
<i>Yes, these are probably
The worst brats in town</i>

13:07.704 --> 13:10.165
So, no, thank you. I'm Melissa.

13:10.165 --> 13:13.752
And I'm actually here not for meat,
but because-- Well, so--

13:14.503 --> 13:16.338
There's a friend of a friend. Or-- No.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.091
- There's a late friend of my alive--
- Yes. Get to the point.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.969
My friend had a roommate named Elsie,
and now Elsie's dead.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.512
And your address was in her datebook.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.889
So, I'm just here to see if you knew her,
or didn't, or--

13:25.889 --> 13:27.641
or anything you do know, but--

13:27.641 --> 13:28.725
Either way, I--

13:28.725 --> 13:31.603
I would love it if you put down
the cleaver while you had a chat with me.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.938
Is that okay to ask?

13:35.023 --> 13:37.317
Elsie's dead, you say?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.195
Yes. I'm sorry.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.866
Was she your girlfriend
or your daughter? Your--

13:43.866 --> 13:45.158
Elsie is...

13:45.909 --> 13:48.996
was my daughter's roommate.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.874
Is your daughter Jenny?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.299
Elsie was kind to me.

14:01.216 --> 14:04.344
She'd check in on occasion
and tell me how my Jenny was doing.

14:05.888 --> 14:08.265
Why can't you check in on Jenny yourself?

14:09.224 --> 14:10.392
I have my reasons.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.145
It's not a happy story.

14:18.734 --> 14:25.574
<i>There was a butcher
Who had a wife and daughter</i>

14:27.159 --> 14:32.998
<i>And a rich man who led them all
Like lambs to the slaughter</i>

14:33.582 --> 14:37.002
<i>He tried to take the butcher's wife</i>

14:37.002 --> 14:40.172
<i>When she refused, he took her life</i>

14:40.172 --> 14:45.761
<i>Blamed the butcher for the crime
And while he was doing time</i>

14:45.761 --> 14:48.764
<i>His daughter came of age</i>

14:48.764 --> 14:53.185
<i>Forced to perform upon the stage</i>

14:54.978 --> 14:56.980
<i>And to be clear</i>

14:57.689 --> 15:00.025
<i>In this scenario</i>

15:00.025 --> 15:04.780
<i>The butcher is me</i>

15:07.199 --> 15:11.370
<i>But the rich man truly
Will pay for his sins</i>

15:11.370 --> 15:15.332
<i>And this time
Dooley will be the one who wins</i>

15:15.332 --> 15:19.169
<i>For there's a debt
That has yet to be repaid</i>

15:19.169 --> 15:23.173
<i>So my course is set for
The blood and the blade</i>

15:23.173 --> 15:27.219
<i>And the death, sweet death
That will bring relief</i>

15:27.219 --> 15:32.057
<i>From the pain and the passion
And the guilt and the grief</i>

15:34.351 --> 15:37.855
<i>I'll heed the call</i>

15:38.689 --> 15:41.775
<i>Kill them all</i>

15:42.734 --> 15:47.364
<i>Kill them all</i>

15:51.034 --> 15:53.579
First of all, oh, no.

15:55.163 --> 15:58.667
But also, I'm so sorry
all of that happened to you, Mr. Blight.

15:58.667 --> 16:02.421
They'll be sorry soon
for what they did to my wife, Daisy.

16:02.421 --> 16:05.674
The rich man
and all who abetted his deeds.

16:05.674 --> 16:11.096
So, the rich man.
Would that be Octavius Kratt?

16:12.639 --> 16:13.473
You know him?

16:14.766 --> 16:15.976
Oh, my gosh.

16:15.976 --> 16:20.480
If Kratt killed your wife,
I bet he killed Elsie too.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.443
He was at the club that night.
We sat at his table.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.777
I have to tell the police.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.571
The police?

16:27.571 --> 16:32.117
Good luck with getting them to care.
Kratt's got his foul claws in all of them.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.913
All the more reason for my cleaver
to dispense justice.

16:36.997 --> 16:40.334
I shall call this my justice cleaver.

16:40.334 --> 16:41.793
That's a good name.

16:42.377 --> 16:47.508
Listen, Mr. Blight, I can't help you
with your revenge plans and I--

16:47.508 --> 16:50.385
I absolutely do not condone
"killing them all."

16:50.385 --> 16:54.056
I just think maybe there are other steps
you could take

16:54.056 --> 16:56.099
before you go full Leatherface.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.479
Like, maybe you can reach out to Jenny.
Tell her the truth.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.397
And let her see me as I am now?

17:03.440 --> 17:08.779
Broken, defeated,
a ghost of the man I once was.

17:09.780 --> 17:10.781
No.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.742
I could not bear the inevitable rejection.

17:16.078 --> 17:22.084
Jenny has no idea I'm out of prison
and back in town. And she must never know.

17:22.876 --> 17:23.877
Got it.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.548
Well,
I'll keep an eye on her for you anyway.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.133
You'd do that for me?

17:31.927 --> 17:32.970
Why?

17:33.929 --> 17:37.391
Let's just say you remind me
of an old friend.

17:39.059 --> 17:43.981
But, in the meantime, let's just not--
you kill anyone, okay?

17:43.981 --> 17:46.567
At least until I come back soon.
Which I will.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.861
As you were with your brisket--

17:48.861 --> 17:50.279
Holy shit!

17:50.863 --> 17:53.490
You gotta lubricate those hinges.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.117
Hi, there. Are you Melissa?

17:55.117 --> 17:56.618
Yes.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.120
I bring a message from Josh--

17:58.120 --> 17:59.788
Wait. Josh? Where is he?

17:59.788 --> 18:03.166
- He wants you to know he's doing fine--
- Where is he? I need to see him.

18:03.959 --> 18:04.960
With all due respect,

18:04.960 --> 18:08.255
I think it would be a lot "groovier"
if you stayed here.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.050
I don't think so,
birthday clown allergic to bras.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.677
You're taking me to him now.

18:15.512 --> 18:20.559
Man. I don't know what's in this bread,

18:20.559 --> 18:26.148
but I'm feeling
strangely fine about everything.

18:26.857 --> 18:31.195
- That's the magic of the tribe, Josh.

18:31.195 --> 18:35.032
- And of what Michael put in the bread.
- Who? Me?

18:38.827 --> 18:39.828
Hello.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.207
Of course.

18:43.207 --> 18:46.502
Hey, Mel. You made it.

18:46.502 --> 18:48.212
Well, this is a new look for you.

18:48.212 --> 18:51.298
The tribe initiated me.
I've got hair now. It's real.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.301
Yeah, well I'm very happy for you
and your new hair.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.928
And I'm happy you're safe.

18:56.428 --> 18:59.890
'Cause what the hell were you thinking?
You broke out of jail?

18:59.890 --> 19:02.768
Okay, yes. That was a big mistake.

19:02.768 --> 19:05.312
But they all really wanted me to do it.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.857
So I kinda got caught up in the moment.

19:08.857 --> 19:11.527
I mean, hippies can be very persuasive.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.403
Okay. Just so you know.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.865
I've been out there trying
to figure out who really killed Elsie.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.825
- Yeah.
- While you've been getting high

19:18.825 --> 19:23.080
with the flower people. I mean--
Did I miss the orgy, dude?

19:23.080 --> 19:26.500
No.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.377
I mean, yes.

19:28.377 --> 19:33.090
But it wasn't really an orgy.
Just everybody getting naked.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.009
But it was more like locker room naked.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.680
- You know, it's...
- I'm sorry. I screwed up.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.765
But I'm wide awake now.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.726
I am aware of what's at stake.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.855
I won't go rogue again. Deal?

19:47.855 --> 19:50.649
- Okay, yeah. Whatever. All right.
- Yeah. You're the best.

19:50.649 --> 19:51.775
Who's the square?

19:52.276 --> 19:54.653
Hey, everybody.

19:54.653 --> 19:58.073
I want to introduce you to my old lady, Melissa.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.741
Well, not old.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.159
Hi there.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.621
Thank you all for taking care of Josh,
my old man.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.251
Okay. I just, you know--
I'm definitely-- I'm not square.

20:09.751 --> 20:12.171
- Try some of our magical bread.
- No, thank you.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.256
- I'm good on magic bread.
- I'll have some.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.091
- No. You're good.
- No.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.467
I'm not gonna have any.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.762
It's not 'cause I'm not cool, okay?
I'm very cool.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.640
You know what? Actually. Idea.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.561
Talk about lettin' it all hang out, right?

20:27.561 --> 20:29.479
Okay. You know.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.482
Oh, yeah. I'm doing it. Yeah.

20:33.859 --> 20:35.068
Yeah! Guess what?

20:36.987 --> 20:39.948
And that was a $68 Wacoal underwire.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.910
But you know what?
Sometimes you just gotta say, "heck it."

20:43.911 --> 20:45.162
Am I right? Yes.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.914
Who's with me? She is, right?

20:47.831 --> 20:48.665
- You.
- Yeah.

20:48.665 --> 20:52.878
Talk about a drag. And I don't mean
the kind you take off joints.

20:53.795 --> 20:56.882
You know what? I don't even care
that you guys don't like me. Right?

20:56.882 --> 21:01.136
'Cause it's not high school. And
I don't need to be part of your dumb club.

21:01.637 --> 21:03.388
I just came to get my husband,

21:03.388 --> 21:07.559
so he can turn himself in to the police
before his big day in court tomorrow.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.102
Right, Josh?

21:10.854 --> 21:13.774
That's right. Sorry, everybody.

21:13.774 --> 21:15.150
Duty calls.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.904
- We're gonna miss you, man.
- Oh, man.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.783
Good luck in court, Josh.

21:22.783 --> 21:24.243
Thanks, Topher.

21:25.077 --> 21:27.746
I hope you find that "doorway to where."

21:29.831 --> 21:31.875
- Oh, brother. I love you.
- I love you.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.169
- Oh, man, I love you.
- That's good.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.422
I think that's a good long hug.

21:37.923 --> 21:38.924
Come on.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.300
Man.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.094
Bye, everybody.

21:42.094 --> 21:46.515
- Thanks again so much for the company.
- Bye, Josh.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.435
And the drugs.

21:51.728 --> 21:52.855
- Okay.
- Bye.

21:53.397 --> 21:55.858
- Nope. Hey. This way.
- We're going this way.

22:03.615 --> 22:05.033
Of course he did it.

22:05.033 --> 22:09.496
He just waltzes into town and suddenly
the blood of a showgirl is on his hands?

22:09.496 --> 22:13.834
Exactly. Only a guilty man
would break out of prison.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.088
Jazz.

22:22.342 --> 22:25.262
Okay, I've got a feeling
this is not gonna be a fair trial.

22:25.262 --> 22:26.471
Hi.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.392
Hi.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.519
- Where is Bobby?
- I don't know.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.730
I gotta let her know
the real killer has to be Kratt.

22:40.319 --> 22:42.362
- Wow.
- Wow.

22:45.616 --> 22:47.868
Sorry I'm late. I hope there aren't any...

22:52.414 --> 22:53.415
objections.

22:55.167 --> 22:56.877
Your Honor, may I approach the bench?

22:56.877 --> 22:58.712
I wish you would.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.589
Watch this, kid.

23:15.187 --> 23:19.525
<i>If it pleases the court
And I know that I do</i>

23:19.525 --> 23:22.945
<i>There's something
That I simply must address</i>

23:24.696 --> 23:29.159
<i>I have heard a report
And I swear it's not true</i>

23:29.159 --> 23:33.455
<i>About the secret to my great success</i>

23:33.956 --> 23:39.253
<i>So I am here to set the record straight</i>

23:39.253 --> 23:42.881
<i>There are just two methods that I use</i>

23:42.881 --> 23:47.511
<i>To help me litigate</i>

23:48.095 --> 23:53.225
<i>Bells and whistles
Will get 'em off</i>

23:53.225 --> 23:56.019
<i>Although the purists, they may scoff</i>

23:56.520 --> 24:00.440
<i>All you need are
Bells and whistles</i>

24:00.440 --> 24:02.860
<i>To win the case</i>

24:02.860 --> 24:06.947
<i>Though other jurists
May say you're a disgrace</i>

24:06.947 --> 24:09.449
<i>The prosecution, they may rest</i>

24:09.449 --> 24:11.785
<i>Convinced that they have done their best</i>

24:11.785 --> 24:14.246
<i>Then I start blowin'
I start clangin'</i>

24:14.246 --> 24:16.999
<i>One more Joe avoids a hangin'</i>

24:16.999 --> 24:21.545
<i>Bells and whistles
Are all you need</i>

24:21.545 --> 24:25.924
<i>Plus a comprehensive knowledge of the law</i>

24:56.455 --> 24:58.498
<i>Plus a comprehensive knowledge</i>

24:58.498 --> 24:59.583
<i>Of the--</i>

25:00.125 --> 25:01.919
<i>Thank you to the judge
And members of the jury</i>

25:01.919 --> 25:04.046
<i>I'll try to make this brief
'Cause I know you're in a hurry</i>

25:04.046 --> 25:05.923
<i>See, my client, the defendant
Dr. Joshua D Skinner</i>

25:05.923 --> 25:08.133
<i>He was merely at the club
To take his darling wife to dinner</i>

25:08.133 --> 25:09.927
<i>He stumbled on the body
Of Miss Elsie, the decedent</i>

25:09.927 --> 25:12.095
<i>And you may jump to conclusions
The fact is that you needn't</i>

25:12.095 --> 25:13.931
<i>The prima facie evidence
Though it's an avalanche</i>

25:13.931 --> 25:16.141
<i>Will be expressly
And indubitably proven circumstantial</i>

25:16.141 --> 25:18.018
<i>The testimony's hearsay
And it reeks of retribution</i>

25:18.018 --> 25:19.937
<i>So what we have is nothing
But malicious prosecution</i>

25:19.937 --> 25:23.482
<i>And a verdict of not guilty
Is the only just solution</i>

25:26.693 --> 25:30.948
<i>Bells and whistles are all you need</i>

25:30.948 --> 25:35.452
<i>Plus a comprehensive knowledge
The kind you get in college</i>

25:36.328 --> 25:43.293
<i>A comprehensive knowledge of the law</i>

25:46.004 --> 25:49.091
I certainly hope
this won't be a split decision.

25:54.263 --> 25:57.391
- Does the jury need time to deliberate?
- Absolutely not, Your Honor.

25:57.391 --> 26:00.936
We, the jury, unanimously find
Bobby Flanagan to be absolutely stunning

26:01.603 --> 26:03.355
and Josh Skinner innocent of all charges.

26:04.982 --> 26:06.149
Case adjourned!

26:06.149 --> 26:08.610
I'll drink to that!

26:09.778 --> 26:12.489
We did it! You're free!

26:14.032 --> 26:17.035
W-- This is a happy ending.
We've got our happy ending.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.579
Yes! You're right!

26:19.121 --> 26:21.456
Let's get the hell out of here
before anything else happens.

26:35.095 --> 26:41.018
<i>You swore everyone would blame him
And that you could easily frame him</i>

26:41.018 --> 26:45.647
<i>But your plot was all for naught</i>

26:45.647 --> 26:47.608
- Sorry, Mr. Kratt.
- We did the best we could.

26:47.608 --> 26:51.737
<i>Why am I flanked by fools?</i>

26:52.446 --> 26:57.326
<i>Idiots and women
Who won't play by my rules</i>

26:57.326 --> 27:01.914
<i>First there was the butcher's wife
And now this Elsie Vale</i>

27:01.914 --> 27:06.877
<i>Why must my quest to find a wife
Always, always fail?</i>

27:07.461 --> 27:12.382
<i>O, dear God up above</i>

27:12.382 --> 27:17.095
<i>Why did you make me so difficult to love?</i>

27:17.095 --> 27:21.975
<i>Why do I want the women
Who don't want me?</i>

27:21.975 --> 27:25.979
<i>I only want the women
Who don't want me</i>

27:26.563 --> 27:30.317
<i>I have to have the women
Who don't want me</i>

27:30.317 --> 27:36.448
<i>And thus it always ends in tragedy</i>

27:46.250 --> 27:51.046
<i>Well, well, well
Perhaps we've found a winner</i>

27:51.046 --> 27:56.301
<i>I must say she's intriguing
This Melissa Skinner</i>

27:56.301 --> 27:59.137
<i>I believe she goes by Gimble</i>

27:59.680 --> 28:04.768
<i>Perhaps this all will turn out
For the best</i>

28:04.768 --> 28:09.231
<i>Maybe this one will be smarter
Than the rest</i>

28:09.815 --> 28:14.820
<i>And I will no longer be alone</i>

28:14.820 --> 28:19.533
<i>Maybe we can kill two birds with one stone</i>

28:20.117 --> 28:24.997
<i>Maybe we can kill two birds with one
Birds with one</i>

28:24.997 --> 28:29.918
<i>Birds with one stone</i>

28:32.004 --> 28:34.131
<i>Flooby wabba noody</i>

28:34.131 --> 28:36.508
<i>Rizzo Cha Cha Doody</i>

28:36.508 --> 28:38.844
<i>Flooby nooby wicky</i>

28:38.844 --> 28:41.680
<i>Zuko 'n Kenickie</i>

28:41.680 --> 28:46.059
<i>Join in the cosmic cantata</i>

28:46.643 --> 28:50.397
<i>Open your soul to a world that's new</i>

28:50.397 --> 28:55.819
<i>It's time to revel in the revelation
Pay tribute to the tribulation</i>

28:55.819 --> 28:58.947
<i>The universe believes in you</i>

28:58.947 --> 29:00.616
And we do too!

29:00.616 --> 29:05.704
<i>There's poverty, war, and injustice</i>

29:05.704 --> 29:09.499
<i>Bigotry, hatred, and greed and fear</i>

29:09.499 --> 29:14.922
<i>Too many people dying in the street
Fighting for a bite to eat</i>

29:14.922 --> 29:18.008
<i>The answer is crystal clear</i>

29:18.008 --> 29:19.468
So lend an ear!

29:20.219 --> 29:24.681
- <i>Everyone's gotta get naked</i>
- <i>We're getting naked</i>

29:24.681 --> 29:30.020
- <i>Get back to the way we were born</i>
- <i>Back to the day we were born</i>

29:30.020 --> 29:33.899
<i>The only solution
A love revolution</i>

29:33.899 --> 29:36.360
<i>Let's get back to the way</i>

29:36.360 --> 29:38.111
<i>Back to the day</i>

29:38.111 --> 29:41.156
<i>Back to the way we were born</i>

29:42.741 --> 29:48.664
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta get naked</i>

29:48.664 --> 29:51.333
<i>Gotta get naked</i>
