00:09.120 --> 00:10.290
Baymax:
Criminal detected.

00:10.290 --> 00:11.380
Hiro:
He's heading east.

00:11.380 --> 00:12.580
I see him.

00:12.580 --> 00:13.960
Aah! Ohh!

00:17.920 --> 00:20.960
-Woo!
-Foiled!
And yes, if you're wondering,

00:20.960 --> 00:22.710
he can breathe fire.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.040
Ahh! Ah!

00:24.040 --> 00:25.750
(electricity surging)

00:26.920 --> 00:28.040
Whoa!

00:31.120 --> 00:32.170
Ah!

00:34.040 --> 00:35.500
(siren blaring)

00:35.500 --> 00:37.040
Hiro:
Is it me,
or is this superhero stuff

00:37.040 --> 00:38.120
getting too easy?

00:38.120 --> 00:40.330
I know!
I could do this
with my eyes closed!

00:41.420 --> 00:42.670
Ow!

00:42.670 --> 00:43.710
-(sliding down post)
-(crash)

00:43.710 --> 00:44.920
Let's not get too cocky.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.330
Though we are getting
pretty good.

00:46.330 --> 00:47.920
Yeah, we are!
And to celebrate,

00:47.920 --> 00:52.500
I say we go see Captain Fancy:
Dawn of Fanciness
tomorrow! Boom!

00:52.500 --> 00:53.540
-I'm in!
-Yes!

00:53.540 --> 00:54.830
Sounds good!

00:54.830 --> 00:58.830
I will deflate,
so no one throws popcorn
at my head this time.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.880
Can't. Plans.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.620
Wait-- What's with her?

01:03.620 --> 01:07.290
-Go Go, gone gone.
-Yeah, she goes off
on her own sometimes.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.250
Really?
Where does she go?

01:09.250 --> 01:13.080
No one knows.
No one dares ask.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.210
Actually, I asked once.
Regretted it.

01:15.210 --> 01:16.380
Immediately.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.960
No one knows.
No one dares ask.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.830
A second time.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.210
Hello.
I am Baymax.

Oh, Fred, come on, man.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.620
Sorry, Wasabi.
But you are

01:59.620 --> 02:01.210
in the splash radius.

02:01.210 --> 02:02.380
Ugh.

02:02.380 --> 02:04.420
So no one wants to know
where Go Go goes?

02:05.830 --> 02:08.540
-Nope.
-It's really none
of our business.

02:08.540 --> 02:11.000
Come on, Fred,
you can't tell me
you're not dying to know.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.120
Well, yeah.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.250
But what are we
gonna do, follow her?

02:14.250 --> 02:16.420
Well, we could.

02:16.420 --> 02:19.920
Mm?
Oh! I see what you're doin'.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.830
Guys, no. Boundaries.

02:21.830 --> 02:24.500
Setting clear boundaries
is one key to maintaining

02:24.500 --> 02:27.000
healthy
interpersonal relationships.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.670
You guys are right.
Totally right.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.170
Yeah.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.290
Fred:
Okay, good breakfast,
gotta go.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.580
This will not end
even close to well.

02:41.580 --> 02:42.960
It really won't.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.750
Fred:
See anything?

02:45.750 --> 02:47.420
Nothing yet.

02:47.420 --> 02:51.250
'Kay.
Then I've got time.
Heathcliff? Bubble me.

02:51.250 --> 02:54.880
Fred, we're supposed
to be watching,
not bubbling.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.420
Hot tubs can be
breeding grounds
for many different types

02:57.420 --> 03:01.420
of bacteria, specifically,
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,

03:01.420 --> 03:03.830
-Legionella...
-(gulp) Wait. What?

03:03.830 --> 03:04.920
There she is!

03:05.920 --> 03:06.920
(engine starting)

03:10.040 --> 03:11.670
Heathcliff,
follow that Go Go!

03:23.420 --> 03:25.210
I will say "hello."

03:25.210 --> 03:26.290
Baymax, no, no!

03:33.880 --> 03:36.500
Ms. Go appears
to be leaving the city proper.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.120
Where is she going?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.500
Fred: Apparently,
Muirahara Woods.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.250
Come on,
there's a sign right there.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.540
I thought you were a genius.

03:49.120 --> 03:52.250
Blech!
Why would she come here?
Why would anyone come here?

03:52.250 --> 03:54.170
Muirahara Woods National Park

03:54.170 --> 03:57.120
is an ideal place to learn
about nature first hand.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.460
It is home to many types

03:58.460 --> 04:00.080
of plants and animals.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.250
And the Hibagon.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.330
The what?

04:02.330 --> 04:03.750
You know, the Hibagon,

04:03.750 --> 04:05.120
the mysterious creature

04:05.120 --> 04:06.330
that roams the woods.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.000
It's said to be
nine feet tall

04:08.000 --> 04:09.210
with a wild mane

04:09.210 --> 04:10.250
of chocolatey-brown hair

04:10.250 --> 04:13.040
and feet the size
of a foot-long sandwich!

04:13.040 --> 04:14.620
Foot-long feet? Really?

04:14.620 --> 04:17.460
Uh, yeah!
Someone totally
got a picture once.

04:18.460 --> 04:19.620
-(beeps)
-Fred: See?

04:19.620 --> 04:22.460
Fred, that is so blurry
it could be anything.

04:22.460 --> 04:23.620
Let's focus on Go Go.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.500
Fine.
We'll solve the mystery
of where Go Go goes,

04:25.500 --> 04:27.210
and maybe, just maybe,

04:27.210 --> 04:28.540
we'll run into
the chocolately-haired beast.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.420
Heathcliff!
Towel me!

04:39.330 --> 04:42.250
-(insects swarming)
-Baymax! (spitting) Oh, God!
Tiny bugs!

04:42.250 --> 04:43.460
Ugh!
They're in my mouth!

04:43.460 --> 04:45.210
Whoa!
So many of them!

04:45.210 --> 04:47.420
Ooh, ooh,
I think they're trying
to tell us something.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.580
Look, they're forming
the letter G!

04:49.580 --> 04:55.210
Gnats swarm in order to fulfill
their biological imperative
to reproduce.

04:55.210 --> 04:57.380
Unnecessary information, Baymax!

04:57.380 --> 04:58.830
-Ahh!
-(splash)

04:58.830 --> 05:00.000
Whoops-a-daisy.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.330
-Ow.
-On a scale of one to ten,

05:02.330 --> 05:04.040
how would you rate your pain?

05:04.040 --> 05:08.330
No pain. (spits)
But my grossed-out level
is at 11.

05:08.330 --> 05:12.460
Hiro, Hiro, Hiro.
This is the great outdoors.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.710
Look around.
Take it all in.

05:14.710 --> 05:17.540
-Behold nature's majesty!
-(squishing)

05:19.790 --> 05:21.880
No, thanks.
I think I'm more
of a city guy.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.830
Yeah, but,
you went to camp, right?

05:23.830 --> 05:26.120
Fred, I've never
been out of San Fransokyo.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.540
What? Never?
Oh, Hiro.

05:28.540 --> 05:29.960
You missed out, my friend.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.920
Camp was the best.
You learned how
to make lanyards.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.540
You learned how to make fires
out of dried grass,

05:35.540 --> 05:37.250
and lanyards!

05:40.420 --> 05:42.330
We can't get too close
or she'll see us.

05:42.330 --> 05:45.420
Roger that.
Operation Follow Go Go
is a go.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.120
-Except...
-What?

05:47.120 --> 05:48.210
Uh, there's...

05:48.210 --> 05:50.880
a really big bug on your face.
Just one, though.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.330
What?

05:52.330 --> 05:53.290
Scanning...

05:54.670 --> 05:58.420
Phanaeus Vindex,
also known as...
a dung beetle.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.380
That's on my face!

05:59.380 --> 06:01.290
Phaneus Vindex
is not poisonous.

06:01.290 --> 06:02.380
Get it off anyway!

06:03.290 --> 06:04.830
-Ow!
-Sorry.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.500
I panicked.

06:08.330 --> 06:09.880
Okay, that's...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.250
Uh, Hiro?
You better get up here.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.880
It's weirder than we ever
could've possibly imagined.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.500
Hold on, I'm--
I'm on my way.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.000
Hiro:
What's she doing?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.290
She's lookin' for somethin'.

06:27.290 --> 06:29.290
Wait.
Hide, hide, hide!

06:30.420 --> 06:34.250
(pecking tree)

06:34.250 --> 06:36.920
I think she's... birdwatching.

06:40.420 --> 06:41.880
Hey...

06:41.880 --> 06:42.880
(chirps)

06:46.500 --> 06:50.420
-(gasp) The Hiba--
-(Fred and Hiro scream)

06:50.420 --> 06:52.420
(bird crying)

06:52.420 --> 06:56.080
-(both yelling)
-Baymax, help!

06:56.080 --> 06:58.500
-I have got you.
-(Fred/Hiro yelling)

06:58.500 --> 07:02.580
(yelling continues)

07:02.580 --> 07:04.210
Baymax:
Oh, no.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.620
(Hiro/Fred yelling)

07:10.000 --> 07:12.210
There are large radishes ahead.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.210
Radishes?
You mean rocks?

07:14.210 --> 07:15.920
Yes.
R-- Radishes.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.830
-Something's wrong.
-Baymax:
Yes. We are going

07:17.830 --> 07:19.460
to hit-- to hit
those radishes.

07:19.460 --> 07:21.540
Fred:
Hiro!
Grab that branch!

07:21.540 --> 07:24.670
-(grunting)
-Ah-ha-ahhh...

07:24.670 --> 07:27.170
Ahh, ahh...

07:27.170 --> 07:30.460
that was-- ahh.
Not as fun as I thought

07:30.460 --> 07:32.250
whitewater rafting
was supposed to be.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.540
Where are we?

07:34.540 --> 07:38.420
-I'll call Heathcliff.
-(beeping and static)

07:38.420 --> 07:40.580
Weird.
My phone's acting crazy.

07:40.580 --> 07:42.420
That's not the only crazy thing.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.420
Hello-lo-lo.
I am Baymax.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.460
Okay, why is he
talking to a tree?

07:47.460 --> 07:48.960
What's goin' on, buddy?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.790
Oh, uh, wet circuits, right?

07:50.790 --> 07:53.210
No, it looks okay.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.170
On a scale
of one to t-t-ten,

07:55.170 --> 07:57.420
how would you rate
your pi-i-ineapple?

07:57.420 --> 07:59.460
I think we better
get you home.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.670
-Clear.
-Baymax, whoa,
whoa, whoa, stop.

08:01.670 --> 08:05.290
Stick out your tongue
and say "Ahh..."

08:05.290 --> 08:07.960
-("Ahh" continues)
-Uh, what are we gonna do?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.290
-("Ahh" continues)
-Calm down, Hiro.

08:09.290 --> 08:11.210
-("Ahh" continues)
-I bet Heathcliff is looking
for us right now.

08:11.210 --> 08:15.000
-(disco music playing)
-Ooh... ahh...

08:15.000 --> 08:16.540
How would Heathcliff
even find us?

08:16.540 --> 08:18.460
We're miles downriver
from where we started.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.250
No one knows
where we are.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.080
Oh!
Maybe Go Go saw us
when we were hiding from her!

08:23.080 --> 08:26.500
Yeah! Go Go!
She can't-- She can't be
that far!

08:26.500 --> 08:28.000
-Go Go!
-Go Go!

08:28.000 --> 08:29.420
-Go Go!
-Go Go!

08:29.420 --> 08:30.420
Both:
Go Go!

08:31.830 --> 08:34.250
-Hey, guys.
-You're in a good mood.

08:34.250 --> 08:37.120
Which is surprising,
given the fact that Hiro
and Fred followed you.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.250
-What?
-We told them not to, but--

08:39.250 --> 08:41.250
They followed me.
Are you sure?

08:41.250 --> 08:42.420
I didn't see them.

08:42.420 --> 08:44.500
I think so.
I mean, they've been gone
all day.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.460
-I'll just ping their phones.
-(tapping keys)

08:46.460 --> 08:47.380
-(humming noise)
-They're dead.

08:47.380 --> 08:50.210
-(gasp)
-Oh-- Sorry.
Their phones are dead.

08:50.210 --> 08:51.330
Try last known location.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.960
-(beeping)
-Muirahara Woods?

08:53.960 --> 08:56.920
Why would they--?
Ooh! That's where you go.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.250
-And?
-And it's getting dark.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.960
(crickets chirping)

09:05.170 --> 09:07.000
Baymax?
Uh, where are you, buddy?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.380
-Baymax?
-Baymax?

09:08.380 --> 09:10.000
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.540
Wait.
What if the Hibagon got him?

09:12.540 --> 09:14.330
-(leaves rustling)
-What was that?

09:14.330 --> 09:15.920
Maybe it was the Hibagon.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.330
(leaves rustling)

09:18.330 --> 09:21.380
-Hibagon...
-Or, maybe it's Baymax.

09:21.380 --> 09:24.500
-(leaves rustling)
-(roaring)

09:24.500 --> 09:27.540
-Or a bear!
-(roaring)

09:27.540 --> 09:31.290
-I... really... hate this place!
-(low growling)

09:31.290 --> 09:32.290
(both screaming)

09:32.290 --> 09:34.290
Time out, bear!

09:34.290 --> 09:36.750
You got every right
to attack these fools.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.670
But I... have every right
to defend 'em.

09:39.670 --> 09:41.790
-It's your choice.
-(loud roar)

09:41.790 --> 09:43.620
Don't give him a choice!

09:43.620 --> 09:47.710
Hold still.
You must intimidate
the bear.

09:47.710 --> 09:50.790
It is the only way.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.380
(roars)

09:54.380 --> 09:55.420
(roars)

09:55.420 --> 09:56.710
(growls)

09:58.290 --> 10:00.040
You never saw me!

10:00.040 --> 10:02.540
-What was that?
-Wait! We need your help!

10:02.540 --> 10:05.170
W-- W-- We're lost!
And none of our gear works!

10:05.170 --> 10:06.500
That's 'cause of Bessie.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.290
Um, who's-- who--
who's Bessie?

10:08.290 --> 10:10.290
The moose, obviously.

10:10.290 --> 10:13.420
No, not the moose.
You dum-dum.

10:13.420 --> 10:15.250
-The bear!
-The bear is Bessie?

10:15.250 --> 10:17.880
-The bear is behind you.
-(growling)

10:17.880 --> 10:18.960
Ned:
Get on!

10:18.960 --> 10:20.330
-Let's get out of here.
-Ohh! Aah!

10:20.330 --> 10:23.420
(roars)

10:26.830 --> 10:28.580
Fred:
Whoa!

10:28.580 --> 10:30.210
This is your house?

10:30.210 --> 10:33.460
-Oh, it's not mine.
-Wait. Then, who lives here?

10:33.460 --> 10:37.460
I do.
But it belongs to the wood.
I just mind it.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.790
You wanna come up
and take a look see?

10:39.790 --> 10:42.120
Actually,
we need to find-- woo!

10:43.290 --> 10:45.620
I don't get to show off
too much.

10:45.620 --> 10:48.210
That's the downside
to the hermit lifestyle.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.040
Oh, my, goodness.
Look at these original
hardwood floors.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.380
Fred. Baymax.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.000
I know, but treehouse!

10:56.000 --> 10:58.380
Look!
Original hardwood everything!

10:58.380 --> 11:00.250
Wait!
Maybe I can spot him
from up here!

11:04.210 --> 11:06.330
Ned Ludd, the real estate king?

11:06.330 --> 11:08.210
The one who went bats
and disappeared?

11:09.420 --> 11:11.080
Uhh...

11:12.420 --> 11:15.170
Oh, this is you, isn't it?

11:15.170 --> 11:16.420
It don't bother me none.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.670
Yeah, people think I'm crazy,

11:18.670 --> 11:19.960
but after what happened to me,

11:19.960 --> 11:21.750
you see,
bunkin' here was--

11:21.750 --> 11:23.830
well, it was
the only sane
thing to do.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.920
I was young.
Full of fire.

11:25.920 --> 11:30.330
Obsessed with gettin' mine.
Oh, I-- I had big plans
for Muirahara--

11:30.330 --> 11:31.750
Mr. Ludd, sorry to interrupt,
but our friend--

11:31.750 --> 11:34.250
Uh, can't you see
I'm holdin' the story snake?

11:34.250 --> 11:36.290
-(snake hisses)
-It's my turn to talk.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.380
-Sorry.
-Where was I?

11:38.380 --> 11:41.170
-(snake hisses)
-I had big plans
for Muirahara.

11:41.170 --> 11:45.620
Tear it all down.
Until one night
fate had a different plan.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.290
It looked like
I was a goner.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.380
Dunzo.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.830
But then, uh-uh.

11:50.830 --> 11:52.790
I was saved.

11:52.790 --> 11:55.620
-Great story.
But we really need to--
-(hissing)

11:56.620 --> 11:58.380
I was saved by nature itself.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.670
(beeping, electricity sparking)

12:08.920 --> 12:13.620
And it was in that moment
I realized I was not meant
to cut down wood, no,

12:13.620 --> 12:18.330
I was meant to live
in the wood, away
from the big city,

12:18.330 --> 12:22.380
Away from all things
techno-illogical.

12:22.380 --> 12:24.330
With Bessie.

12:24.330 --> 12:27.330
Still not clear
on this Bessie.

12:33.710 --> 12:36.670
Oh, Bessie's
the meterorite. Got it.
Makes total sense.

12:36.670 --> 12:41.540
The magnetic field
from... uh, Bessie, heh--
must be what killed your tech.

12:41.540 --> 12:44.080
A-- And ours. Baymax.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.120
That's what's wrong with him.

12:45.120 --> 12:48.250
Hands off!
That's a good girl, Bessie.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.210
That's a good little girl.

12:49.210 --> 12:52.080
Now, now,
who's a good little girl?

12:52.080 --> 12:54.120
(owl hooting)

12:57.830 --> 12:59.960
Goodbye, Honey Lemon.

13:02.170 --> 13:03.500
Listen, our friend--

13:03.500 --> 13:06.330
-Quick question. Have you ever
seen the Hibagon?
-(whispers) Fred!

13:06.330 --> 13:09.330
The Hibagon,
lemme think on that, here.

13:09.330 --> 13:13.290
-(mice squeaking)
-Boo! (laughing)

13:13.290 --> 13:14.460
You're lookin' at him!

13:14.460 --> 13:16.420
What?

13:16.420 --> 13:19.670
I like people thinkin'
there's a big old bogeyman
lurkin' around the wood.

13:19.670 --> 13:21.330
Keeps those dum-dums away.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.000
Sure, yeah.
That's explains a lot, actually.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.330
(static)

13:25.330 --> 13:29.540
Technology.
Humanity's worse idea ever.

13:29.540 --> 13:34.380
That's not true.
Some technology is good.
It-- It helps people.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.380
Pfft, helps people.
Technology doesn't help people.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.330
More sap?

13:39.330 --> 13:41.000
Speaking of help, uh,
we really need yours.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.080
Okay, our friend is lost
in the woods, and we need
to find him.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.420
What are y'all doin'
just sittin' there?
Let's go!

13:53.920 --> 13:56.380
Hello-hello.

13:56.380 --> 13:59.710
I am Baymax companion.
Your personal healthcare--

13:59.710 --> 14:00.710
(beeping)

14:02.620 --> 14:07.380
Hello.
I am B-- Bay-Bay-Bay-Bay-
-Bay-Bay-Bay-Bay--

14:10.540 --> 14:13.120
(sigh)
I'm not picking up anything.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.460
So... why the woods?

14:15.460 --> 14:18.460
(sigh)
I like to go birdwatching.
Okay?

14:18.460 --> 14:20.080
It relaxes me.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.250
Ooh, that sounds fun.
Maybe I could come sometime?

14:22.250 --> 14:26.040
No.
It's my alone thing.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.540
Guys...
it's Fred's.

14:28.540 --> 14:30.460
-They were here.
-Look.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.290
Since Baymax isn't here,
I'll just say it.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.880
Oh, no.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.250
(bees buzzing)

14:38.250 --> 14:41.710
I cannot de-- de-- de-activate
until you say you are mortified
with your hair.

14:43.790 --> 14:44.790
(sniffing)

14:51.670 --> 14:54.830
Ach!
Um, quick question, what exactly
should I be tasting?

14:54.830 --> 14:56.580
Because I'm picking up
the faintest hint--

14:58.380 --> 15:01.460
dirt? Yeah.
Definitely mostly dirt.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.000
Good doggie.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.080
Hiro:
Baymax!

15:08.080 --> 15:11.040
Nice kitty.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.880
Your friend
is a robot?

15:14.880 --> 15:17.330
A good robot.
He helps people.

15:17.330 --> 15:20.330
No such animal
as a good robot.

15:20.330 --> 15:24.210
Is he trying to scare us
because, mission accomplished.

15:24.210 --> 15:25.620
Ned:
You know what I think?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.920
I'm gonna boot him over a cliff.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.170
That's what good old Bessie
would want me to do.

15:31.170 --> 15:32.710
Goodbye.

15:35.210 --> 15:36.620
-Aah!
-Uhh!

15:38.290 --> 15:39.540
Baymax!

15:41.330 --> 15:43.830
(crickets chirping)

15:43.830 --> 15:45.580
So, do you know
where we are?

15:45.580 --> 15:48.380
Nope.
I've never been
this far in before.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.080
Why not?
When it's so warm
and inviting.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.290
Come on!

15:56.000 --> 15:57.080
That was weird.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.540
I am not liking this.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.750
(beeping)

15:59.750 --> 16:02.250
My phone's acting
bizarre, too.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.830
-What is going on?
-(bushes rustling)

16:06.210 --> 16:08.960
It's a bear!
This is it!

16:08.960 --> 16:12.330
This is how it ends!
Not with a bang,
but with a bear!

16:12.330 --> 16:16.830
Wasabi, stay calm,
and back away slowly.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.420
Fred:
Help!

16:18.420 --> 16:22.420
Fred!
Uh-- Is-- Is-- Is there
a bear in there?

16:22.420 --> 16:24.290
Ugh, come on.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.000
Oh!
You guys are okay!

16:28.000 --> 16:31.420
-Kinda.
-Plasma blade
would be handy right now.

16:31.420 --> 16:35.380
-Hey, Go Go.
-We'll have a convo
about privacy later.

16:35.380 --> 16:38.120
But for now,
I'm just glad you're alive.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.420
(both grunting)

16:39.420 --> 16:40.790
Where's Baymax?

16:40.790 --> 16:42.880
The crazy wilderness
real estate developer
got him!

16:42.880 --> 16:44.500
-What?
-It's a long story.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.670
Which way did he go?

16:45.670 --> 16:47.880
I-- I don't know!
Where do we even start?

16:47.880 --> 16:50.170
Come on, stop it.
You'll think of something.

16:50.170 --> 16:53.080
Nothing works out here.
And this Ned guy,
he knows the woods

16:53.080 --> 16:55.460
like the back of his hand
and we're-- we're lost.

16:55.460 --> 16:59.040
So improvise.
Baymax needs you.

16:59.040 --> 17:03.000
Okay.
Well, we could, uh-- aww!
Ex-- Except for Bessie.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.460
Bessie.
Who's Bessie?

17:04.460 --> 17:06.330
Weirdest part of the long story.

17:06.330 --> 17:09.460
Wait, that's it!
Go Go, can you make a fire?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.420
Hiro:
Ned thinks there are
only two of us,

17:12.420 --> 17:14.210
so we can us that
to our advantage.

17:14.210 --> 17:16.750
Since we can't track him,
we need to lure him.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.000
How are we gonna do that?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.380
By threatening the thing
he cares about most...

17:20.380 --> 17:21.790
the wood.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.710
We're not gonna
hurt the woods, are we?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.290
Of course not.
But Ned doesn't know that.

17:26.290 --> 17:28.330
What if he doesn't wanna
just give up Baymax?

17:28.330 --> 17:30.040
Well, we've got sticks
and pine cones.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.920
Oh, and leaves!
Also, dirt.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.000
I think I can make that work.

17:40.290 --> 17:41.500
(grunts)

17:46.250 --> 17:47.420
Ah!

17:47.420 --> 17:48.290
Whoa!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.040
Oh!

18:06.670 --> 18:08.290
-Hey--
-Ohh!

18:12.960 --> 18:14.040
-(thud)
-(grunts)

18:15.540 --> 18:17.920
Oh-- Okay, here we go!

18:17.920 --> 18:19.790
I wish my camp counselor
could see me now!

18:19.790 --> 18:22.000
Bring on weird beard!

18:23.290 --> 18:25.710
Baymax:
Completing comprehensive
health profile,

18:25.710 --> 18:27.960
file, file, file.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.920
My scan indicates
that you are pregnant,
pregnant, pregnant.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.790
Robots. Pfft.
Good for nothin'.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.830
No!
The wood!

18:40.250 --> 18:42.250
And dairy sensitive.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.620
Oh.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.670
I am a choo-choo train.

18:56.670 --> 18:58.710
(fire crackling)

19:01.250 --> 19:03.250
-(traps snapping)
-Ah-hoo...

19:03.250 --> 19:06.250
Nice try, city boys.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.460
Ned?
All we want is our friend back.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.460
And then we'll go.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.330
A robot can't be a friend,
you dum-dum.

19:11.330 --> 19:12.540
Don't you get it?

19:12.540 --> 19:15.830
It's a machine.
And machines are
not to be trusted.

19:15.830 --> 19:17.420
Bessie told me.

19:17.420 --> 19:22.500
Good...
anyway, Bessie told me
to give us back Baymax.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.290
(whispers)
Play along.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.290
Bessie don't talk
to strangers.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.960
And your friend
is goin' over the cliff.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.670
I made that decision previously.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.250
-Good luck.
-You too, Hiro.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.250
Fly far.

19:44.710 --> 19:45.750
Oh!

19:45.750 --> 19:46.790
Ooh!

19:46.790 --> 19:49.420
Aah!
What's this?
What's all this?

19:49.420 --> 19:52.380
I've got to remember
this recipe! Mmm!

19:52.380 --> 19:53.920
(grunting)

19:55.330 --> 19:56.880
Huh?

19:56.880 --> 19:59.210
How many of you are there?

20:00.540 --> 20:02.750
Baymax? Baymax!

20:02.750 --> 20:04.250
-(bats crying)
-Ahh!

20:04.250 --> 20:06.120
-(bushes rustling)
-Not the bear again.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.710
Huh?

20:12.830 --> 20:15.620
-Gotcha!
-Guys! Help!

20:15.620 --> 20:17.250
-I'm out!
-Me too!

20:17.250 --> 20:19.830
So, Ned...
may I call you Ned?

20:24.290 --> 20:26.420
You thought I'd fall
in that hole?

20:26.420 --> 20:29.330
Yes, I was actually
hoping you would,
it would've been great.

20:29.330 --> 20:32.540
-(bushes rustling)
-(moose grunt)

20:32.540 --> 20:34.120
-Wh--? Huh!
-(thud)

20:34.120 --> 20:36.460
-Got him!
-Choo-choo.

20:36.460 --> 20:39.460
-(moose grunts)
-Wait, no!
He's still after us!

20:39.460 --> 20:40.750
Hello.

20:42.790 --> 20:43.830
Now!

20:43.830 --> 20:44.880
Ooh!

20:44.880 --> 20:46.250
Oof!

20:46.250 --> 20:48.170
Ha-ha!
Told you we needed three!

20:48.170 --> 20:50.710
Oh! My extremity!

20:50.710 --> 20:53.210
If you help us
get Baymax away
from the meteorite,

20:53.210 --> 20:54.830
he can fix your arm.

20:56.670 --> 20:59.790
Baymax:
Your arm should heal
in three to six weeks.

20:59.790 --> 21:02.250
What's your end game, robot?

21:02.250 --> 21:04.250
Enslave the human race?

21:04.250 --> 21:06.290
World domination?

21:07.790 --> 21:09.540
Apply ice to reduce swelling.

21:09.540 --> 21:11.500
See?
Not all technology is bad.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.580
You're a fool
if you think that's true.

21:13.580 --> 21:16.960
Technology will be
the downfall of us all!

21:16.960 --> 21:18.830
Just you wait!

21:18.830 --> 21:21.330
Now get outta my wood!

21:21.330 --> 21:25.380
Coulda just said thank you
instead of doin' the creepy
echoey thing!

21:25.380 --> 21:27.580
Heathcliff must be worried sick!

21:27.580 --> 21:30.460
(disco music playing)

21:30.460 --> 21:34.250
Uh, don't wake him
He looks so peaceful.

21:39.380 --> 21:43.080
(theme music playing)
