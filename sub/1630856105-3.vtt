WEBVTT

00:34.367 --> 00:38.788
Okay, there I am at my roommate's
bandmate's funeral thinking,

00:38.788 --> 00:41.458
"Whoa, like, what if I can die?"

00:41.458 --> 00:44.044
And just when I found out I'm a cinephile?

00:44.711 --> 00:47.464
Anyway, that's why I'm busy
writing this movie.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.007
So don't bother calling.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.551
This is your son, by the way.

00:52.677 --> 00:53.511
Young Neil.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.905
I've written nothing?

01:29.881 --> 01:31.674
What?

01:40.350 --> 01:43.686
My sleep paralysis demon?

02:13.800 --> 02:17.220
I wrote
a feature-length screenplay in my sleep.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.431
I'm a screenwriter!

04:28.309 --> 04:30.478
You changed your hair. What's up, Ramona?

04:30.478 --> 04:32.063
Nothing major.

04:32.063 --> 04:35.233
Just, somebody kidnapped
Scott Pilgrim and faked his death.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.818
You're f****** joking.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.321
Stacey, I'm taking my fifteen.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.573
You took your fifteen 20 minutes ago!

04:42.573 --> 04:45.451
And would you stop swearing?
We have f******* customers!

04:45.451 --> 04:46.411
F*** my life!

04:48.705 --> 04:50.290
Tell me everything.

04:51.582 --> 04:55.920
Last night, in my dreams,
I saw Scott's subspace highway...

04:57.714 --> 04:58.798
<i>and heard his voice.</i>

04:58.798 --> 05:01.968
Ramona...

05:01.968 --> 05:03.469
<i>Subspace what?</i>

05:03.970 --> 05:05.054
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

05:05.638 --> 05:07.640
<i>I think it means he's alive.</i>

05:15.148 --> 05:17.483
<i>So I went back to The Rockit
to look at the security footage</i>

05:17.483 --> 05:19.444
<i>of what we thought was Scott's death.</i>

05:39.881 --> 05:43.593
<i>Someone grabbed him
and pulled him into a portal.</i>

05:50.558 --> 05:52.602
<i>Somebody wants us to think he's dead.</i>

05:53.811 --> 05:55.813
I knew it was too good to be true.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.482
Can a guy get a croissant?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.151
Wallace? Have you been out all night?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.362
- Did you say Scott's alive?
- Yeah.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.448
Trippy.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.117
Well, if you see him,
tell him I changed the locks.

06:08.117 --> 06:11.162
And if you see me,
remind me to change the locks.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.831
Your sugar daddy days are over?

06:13.831 --> 06:15.792
For him, absolutely.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.251
For others, we'll see.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.253
The future is a mystery.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.838
Here's your f****** croissant!

06:22.423 --> 06:23.466
Ladies.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.677
So why would someone kidnap Scott?

06:26.677 --> 06:29.806
And why would they get my hopes up
by making it seem like he was dead?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.808
I haven't figured that out yet.

06:31.808 --> 06:32.809
Yet?

06:32.809 --> 06:34.936
Don't tell me
you're gonna try to find him.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.604
I think I have to.

06:36.604 --> 06:40.316
Ramona, I don't see
how any of this is your responsibility.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.277
You went on one date.
How good could it have been?

06:43.277 --> 06:45.571
Honestly, great.

06:45.571 --> 06:49.242
Your date with Scott Pilgrim?

06:49.242 --> 06:50.326
Yikes.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.995
Well, more power to you.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.373
So what's your next move, Columbo?

06:55.373 --> 06:57.291
Well, you know everyone, right?

06:57.291 --> 07:00.753
I thought you could give me a rundown
of the major characters in Scott's life.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.631
More like major suspects.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.010
Well, let's see. There's Stephen Stills.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.096
My ex, the singer in the band.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.516
He's a mess. Too much anxiety
for even the simplest decisions.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.018
No way could he mastermind a kidnapping.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.188
Then there's Stephen's roommate,
Young Neil.

07:19.188 --> 07:22.608
He's kinda sheltered, and he's only 19,
but don't let that fool you.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.027
He's an idiot.
He'd make Scott look like a genius,

07:25.027 --> 07:27.530
but he can't,
because that's literally impossible.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.240
What about Envy Adams?

07:29.240 --> 07:32.118
Oh boy! Scott's ex. The big one--

07:32.118 --> 07:36.956
Excuse me. I asked for an iced Americano.
This is a hot Americano--

07:36.956 --> 07:38.583
Then add some ice cubes to it!

07:39.083 --> 07:40.626
You stupid f***.

07:40.626 --> 07:44.672
As I was saying, Envy Adams
pulled Scott's heart out of his chest

07:44.672 --> 07:47.758
and stomped all over it
with her patent leather combat boots.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.428
<i>And that was before she went on
to become a global sex symbol.</i>

07:50.428 --> 07:52.722
I saw her do her thing at the funeral.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.557
She's even hotter in person.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.184
Are we sure they dated?

07:56.184 --> 07:59.937
Yeah, you're obviously not the only one
with questionable taste, Ramona.

08:00.813 --> 08:01.689
Who else?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.443
You know who you should talk to?
His other ex.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.821
- She's known him longer than anyone.
- Okay. Who is she?

08:14.994 --> 08:17.455
What is Sex Bob-omb without Scott?

08:17.455 --> 08:23.044
He really added something to our sound,
something undefinable.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.630
Bass. He added bass.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.381
Right! Exactly!

08:27.924 --> 08:29.675
Can we have a band with no bass?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.929
What if we find a new bass player
and they make us worse?

08:32.929 --> 08:36.265
The odds are they'd make us better
because we probably sucked.

08:37.141 --> 08:38.768
There's always Scott's understudy.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.276
No! I fear change!

08:48.986 --> 08:51.531
Hey, you wanna
try playing something together?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.823
Just for fun?

08:52.823 --> 08:54.158
Me and you?

08:54.742 --> 08:56.369
I don't see anyone else in here.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.583
How long have you been playing the drums?

09:02.583 --> 09:04.794
A long time. Since I was 14.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.672
Drumming is a great outlet
for my emotions.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.799
- Rage, mostly.
- Wow!

09:10.466 --> 09:12.927
But how do I know which notes to play?

09:13.511 --> 09:16.055
It's up to you.
That's why they call it "play."

10:26.083 --> 10:26.917
Whoa!

10:30.004 --> 10:32.131
How long have you been playing bass?

10:34.884 --> 10:36.010
What time is it?

10:37.053 --> 10:37.970
4 p.m.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.306
Then, four hours.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.557
I'm late for work.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.187
Have you ever thought about collaborating
with a seasoned songwriter?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.704
- Sorry, I'm late.
- I don't care.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.547
Kim, customer.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.345
Funny thought.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.973
Maybe he faked his own death
to get out of paying his late fees.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.183
You're half right.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.518
Which half?

11:25.518 --> 11:26.686
He's not dead.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.814
The house always wins.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.317
It's just a dumb thing a dumb person
told me one time.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.779
So. You've been using
Scott's unconscious dreamscape

11:36.779 --> 11:38.781
to deliver DVDs quicker?

11:38.781 --> 11:41.617
You're the first person in Canada
to understand that.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.285
It's not a complicated concept.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.038
No wonder you're putting us
out of business.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.208
- Canada?
- No, video stores.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.713
Julie said you knew him the longest.
When did you meet?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.968
You told me you were good at drawing.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.803
Maps are hard.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.013
If I had to draw a sheep, though,
I'd draw it perfect.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.223
A sheep?

12:04.223 --> 12:05.349
Draw me a sheep.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.354
That's the worst sheep I've ever seen.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.149
What are you talking about?
This sheep is excellent!

12:17.486 --> 12:19.113
<i>He was always an idiot.</i>

12:19.113 --> 12:22.616
<i>But one thing led to another,
and to my continued embarrassment,</i>

12:23.409 --> 12:27.204
<i>Scott Pilgrim became my first boyfriend.</i>

12:28.497 --> 12:32.877
Is Scott drawing you a sheep
your most romantic memory, or...

12:32.877 --> 12:35.713
There was this one time
I was kidnapped by a rival school,

12:35.713 --> 12:38.549
and Scott had to fight through
an entire army of teen jerks

12:38.549 --> 12:40.885
and their leader Simon Lee to rescue me.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.678
<i>That's a romantic memory.</i>

12:44.430 --> 12:48.809
Yeah, but how romantic can a memory be
if things ended terribly?

12:51.645 --> 12:53.481
<i>Well, you're still friends.</i>

12:53.481 --> 12:55.149
That's gotta be a good sign.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.526
He's at least a lovable idiot, right?

13:00.946 --> 13:03.032
You like him, don't you?

13:04.700 --> 13:05.993
There were sparks.

13:07.661 --> 13:08.788
You're in trouble.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.873
Why does this always happen to me?

13:10.873 --> 13:14.043
I don't know. Maybe you could ask
one of your seven evil exes?

13:15.252 --> 13:17.880
I kinda assumed
they'd be your first suspects.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.632
I'm not in a hurry to see them.

13:23.594 --> 13:24.804
What?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.597
Sounds like Hollie's taking care of it.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.015
Kim! Customer!

13:31.018 --> 13:32.311
This is unexpected.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.814
Well, you better get better at expecting.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.774
You two know each other?

13:36.774 --> 13:39.068
We were college roommates.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.070
And more!

13:41.070 --> 13:42.238
And more.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.281
So, you're...

13:44.782 --> 13:48.452
Roxie Richter! Ramona's fourth evil ex!

13:48.452 --> 13:49.453
Okay!

13:49.453 --> 13:51.664
Fourth? What about two and three?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.999
Four ain't nothing but a number, baby.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.793
Besides, the League lies in ruin.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.587
So here I am!

13:58.587 --> 14:00.506
Rox you like a hurricane!

14:00.506 --> 14:01.632
Why are you even--

14:02.925 --> 14:04.593
I'm here for us, Ramona.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.428
First in line to win your heart.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.014
Because I have something
the others never will.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.516
Which is what, exactly?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.726
Emotional intelligence.

14:12.726 --> 14:16.021
None of these boys know
how to talk about their feelings.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.691
What you fail to mention is
that when it comes to feelings,

14:18.691 --> 14:20.317
you're as clueless as the boys.

14:20.317 --> 14:23.487
That is so unfair!
You're just impossible to talk to!

14:23.487 --> 14:25.865
You want to talk about feelings?
Start talking.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.576
I've got a better idea.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.953
Let's fight about 'em!

14:30.953 --> 14:33.831
<i>Roxie Richter versus Ramona Flowers!</i>

14:33.831 --> 14:34.748
<i>Fight!</i>

14:36.125 --> 14:36.959
Whoa!

14:46.552 --> 14:48.429
Are we really doing this again?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.647
Ramona! You b****!

15:00.107 --> 15:00.983
Get off!

15:15.706 --> 15:16.749
An old movie?

15:22.379 --> 15:23.422
Come on!

15:30.638 --> 15:32.389
They're ruining my movie.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.391
I'm taking my fifteen.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.147
<i>Ora!</i>

15:45.486 --> 15:46.487
You're done--

15:53.369 --> 15:54.453
That's cheap.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.809
I don't want to fight you, Roxie.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.937
Gonna run away? Like you did back then?

16:37.246 --> 16:38.956
Roxie, I...

17:10.237 --> 17:11.113
Roxie...

17:12.406 --> 17:13.240
I'm sorry.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.243
For what?

17:17.202 --> 17:18.746
For leaving the way I did.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.153
<i>I was too afraid to face you.</i>

17:51.862 --> 17:54.031
So you left without a word?

17:54.031 --> 17:56.283
You made me feel like nothing!

17:56.825 --> 17:58.243
You were afraid?

17:58.952 --> 17:59.995
Good for you!

17:59.995 --> 18:02.748
All I wanted was for you to see me!

18:05.084 --> 18:06.293
I'm sorry.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.924
Apology accepted.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.010
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you win.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.363
Roxie!

18:58.095 --> 18:59.012
Roxie!

19:40.137 --> 19:43.098
As far as I'm concerned, you won.

19:45.392 --> 19:50.772
College doesn't seem that long ago,
but we were pretty immature, weren't we?

20:00.991 --> 20:04.620
You know, I can't remember the last time
I just hung out with the girls.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.829
This is nice.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.748
The snacks aren't free, you know.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.209
Come on! Fighting makes me hungry.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.545
- You were really kicking my ass.
- You're not just saying that?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.297
I never just say anything.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.882
Nice. Should we kiss?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.344
I have unfinished business with Scott.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.221
Emotional business?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.680
He's dead, Ramona.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.935
He's not dead. It's complicated.
I've gotta find him first.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.354
But I'd like to be your friend.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.940
- With benefits?
- No benefits.

20:32.940 --> 20:33.857
Worth a shot.

20:33.857 --> 20:34.983
What about you?

20:36.610 --> 20:37.486
I'm not...

20:50.457 --> 20:51.708
No sparks.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.585
Worth a shot.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.004
What about your hot coworker?
Is she coming back?

20:56.004 --> 20:58.090
Okay, it's time for you to leave.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.224
At least I have one less suspect.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.518
Roxie didn't know Scott was alive.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.688
This was a productive day
as far as fights are concerned.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.816
Everybody needs closure.
That's why they call it closure.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.944
Now you're one step closer
to the dumb boy of your dreams,

21:18.944 --> 21:21.113
and you buried the hatchet with an ex.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.531
Multitasking.

21:32.082 --> 21:35.127
Don't tell me I'm gonna have to do this
with all seven of them.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.881
Hollywood legend Lucas Lee
is one of your exes?

21:41.008 --> 21:42.217
Unfortunately.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.260
Damn, Ramona.

21:43.260 --> 21:47.139
I know he's a handsome, big-chested,
devil-may-care Hollywood d-bag,

21:47.139 --> 21:51.518
but is he evil enough
to kidnap a dude and fake his death?

21:52.519 --> 21:54.146
Only one way to find out.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.575
My mistake.
I thought you were a garbage can. Sorry!

22:20.881 --> 22:21.715
F***!

22:29.056 --> 22:31.308
Gideon Graves? G-Man?

22:32.559 --> 22:35.270
So you don't remember me.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.399
Gideon Graves wasn't my birth name.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.360
It was an identity I created.

22:42.402 --> 22:46.406
When I moved to New York City,
I left my past behind and leveled up.

22:47.240 --> 22:51.328
But back in the day,
you knew me by another name.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.045
Gordon?

23:00.045 --> 23:02.631
Gordon Goose from North Bay, Ontario?

23:03.298 --> 23:04.299
Fearless.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.718
Then you do remember me.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.388
You may be the only one who does.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.391
Julie, I've lost everything.

23:13.266 --> 23:17.479
My empire is gone.
My billionaire friends have shunned me.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.148
Even my millionaire friends
have turned their backs.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.110
I couldn't even get
a reservation at McDonald's.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.320
They laughed at me when I called.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.574
So I spent the last of my pocket money
on bus fare to Toronto

23:30.283 --> 23:33.662
just to see one sympathetic face.

23:40.127 --> 23:40.961
Gordon,

23:41.753 --> 23:43.463
get your butt in here.
