WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.833
‐ Your story shows

00:02.833 --> 00:04.292
that the highest levels
of the company

00:04.292 --> 00:07.500
knew exactly how dangerous
the drug was.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.875
‐ Okay, I'll testify.

00:08.875 --> 00:11.792
Please, I just need some Oxy.

00:11.792 --> 00:14.125
She's relapsing
from the stress.

00:14.125 --> 00:16.042
She can't testify.

00:16.042 --> 00:18.167
‐ No! No, Dad, please!

00:18.167 --> 00:19.958
‐...destroyed our damn family!

00:19.958 --> 00:22.708
‐ Please, Dad!
‐ Get your hands off of me!

00:23.750 --> 00:25.458
A shares have a majority

00:25.458 --> 00:26.792
and Richard Sackler
is now named

00:26.792 --> 00:28.542
president of Purdue Pharma.

00:28.542 --> 00:32.042
‐ Dr. Finnix, is this yours?
You're under arrest.

00:32.042 --> 00:33.500
How long you here for?

00:33.500 --> 00:34.583
‐ 90 days.

00:34.583 --> 00:36.875
You think you can
get me some pills?

00:36.875 --> 00:39.958
‐ What's your next move?
‐ Go back to the FDA

00:39.958 --> 00:41.875
to make another set of demands

00:41.875 --> 00:43.208
to restrict access
to this drug.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.417
‐ Can you think about
how what you're doing

00:45.417 --> 00:47.042
might be affecting me?

00:47.042 --> 00:48.417
‐ No, I can't. I'm sorry.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.208
This is how I grew up, Lucas.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.542
Watching my friends
die from drugs.

00:53.542 --> 00:55.000
If you continue on this path,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.250
you're going to end up
just like them.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.625
‐ Hughes. Mark Hughes.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.000
Corvelli, Josh.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.000
‐ My name is Jay McCloskey.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.792
I am the U.S. Attorney
for the State of Maine.

03:04.792 --> 03:07.292
I am here today because
rampant drug abuse

03:07.292 --> 03:09.250
has infiltrated
our great state.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.083
Dr. Richard?

03:13.083 --> 03:15.792
Sorry to disturb you at lunch,
but there's an urgent issue.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.000
‐ An 80 mg tablet of OxyContin

03:18.000 --> 03:21.333
sells on the street for $100.

03:21.333 --> 03:26.042
This diversion has created a
domino effect of related crime.

03:26.042 --> 03:27.833
As U.S. Attorney,
I will be sending letters

03:27.833 --> 03:29.417
to doctors across our state

03:29.417 --> 03:33.208
to alert them to
the grave dangers of OxyContin.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.500
Any questions?

03:34.500 --> 03:36.083
‐ It says that OxyContin

03:36.083 --> 03:37.875
is becoming the most
serious criminal problem‐‐

03:37.875 --> 03:39.875
‐ Yes, I know how to read.

03:44.042 --> 03:47.708
How many of these letters
were sent?

03:47.708 --> 03:49.625
‐ He sent one
to every single doctor

03:49.625 --> 03:51.625
in the entire state of Maine.

03:56.958 --> 03:58.208
I remember the day

03:58.208 --> 03:59.708
that I first decided
to get clean.

03:59.708 --> 04:05.042
Me and my buddy Josh, we had
this drug test coming up, um,

04:05.042 --> 04:07.625
which is not great news
for two addicts, you know.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.708
So we ran to our dealer
and we're like,

04:09.708 --> 04:12.708
"Hey, man,
you know, what can we do?"

04:12.708 --> 04:14.542
And he tells us,

04:14.542 --> 04:17.458
"If you drink bleach
on the day of your test,

04:17.458 --> 04:19.208
it cleans your blood."

04:19.208 --> 04:21.708
So, the day of the test
comes around,

04:21.708 --> 04:23.167
and we're in the back
of the car,

04:23.167 --> 04:26.417
and we got this industrial
strength container of bleach,

04:26.417 --> 04:28.208
and we drink.

04:28.208 --> 04:32.375
Except the bleach fucking
burns like hell going down,

04:32.375 --> 04:37.042
so immediately I'm gagging,
You know, I spit it everywhere.

04:37.042 --> 04:42.833
But Josh, man‐‐fucking Josh,
he‐‐he downs it.

04:50.292 --> 04:52.542
Uh, the day Josh died

04:52.542 --> 04:56.000
is the day I knew
I needed to get clean.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.750
Uh, a year ago today, actually.

05:02.750 --> 05:07.792
Um, I've been to rehab
three times now, but,

05:07.792 --> 05:09.667
God, I finally feel like

05:09.667 --> 05:12.375
it's starting to make sense,
you know?

05:12.375 --> 05:16.125
‐ My third time was when it
really started to make sense.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.292
‐ Thanks, Dirk.
It takes a lot of guts

05:20.292 --> 05:23.042
to admit that your life
has become unmanageable.

05:23.042 --> 05:25.167
And we got your back.

05:25.167 --> 05:27.167
‐ Thank you.

05:28.958 --> 05:31.375
‐ Samuel.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.083
It's your turn.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.042
Would you like to share
anything today?

05:35.042 --> 05:37.833
‐ Oh, uh,

05:37.833 --> 05:39.833
no, no.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.083
‐ Maybe tomorrow.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.208
‐ Yeah.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.958
‐ Ian.

05:48.958 --> 05:52.125
We haven't heard from you yet.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.333
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, man. What's up?

06:01.333 --> 06:03.000
‐ I was thinking
about what y'all

06:03.000 --> 06:04.417
were talking about out there.

06:04.417 --> 06:08.458
H‐‐how many times
have y'all been to rehab?

06:08.458 --> 06:11.583
‐ This is my, uh, fourth time.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.875
‐ Fifth for me.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.542
‐ All of it here?
Same place?

06:16.542 --> 06:18.208
‐ Nah, I've been
to three other centers.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.500
I like this one the best.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.042
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Yeah, me too.

06:22.042 --> 06:25.083
‐ I'm just‐‐I'm just worried,
you know?

06:25.083 --> 06:26.667
Worried maybe it doesn't work.

06:26.667 --> 06:30.042
‐ Hey, Samuel, this place
was amazing for my cousin.

06:30.042 --> 06:32.875
He hasn't had a drink
in nine years.

06:32.875 --> 06:37.000
‐ Look, man, it's either here,
jail, or the morgue.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.125
‐ Yeah.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.917
I feel ignored sometimes.

06:45.458 --> 06:48.792
It's, uh, not easy

06:48.792 --> 06:51.458
being with someone who's never

06:51.458 --> 06:53.833
really present with you.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.792
‐ I feel bad. I‐‐

06:56.792 --> 06:59.792
it's just‐‐it's hard for me to

06:59.792 --> 07:01.583
talk about things
that are not work‐related.

07:01.583 --> 07:02.792
‐ Yeah, she's obsessed
with work.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.250
‐ I'm not obsessed with work.
‐ You are.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.125
‐ I'm just trying to prevent
mass deaths from occurring

07:06.125 --> 07:07.417
across the country.
‐ I can't really compete with

07:07.417 --> 07:08.667
mass deaths
across the country.

07:08.667 --> 07:09.833
‐ I'm not asking you
to compete with that.

07:09.833 --> 07:10.917
I'm just asking you
to understand that

07:10.917 --> 07:12.750
I can't just turn that off.

07:14.333 --> 07:18.667
‐ But you may be causing
the death of your marriage.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.083
Do you see
Paul's point of view?

07:28.042 --> 07:29.875
‐ I don't want that. I‐‐

07:32.417 --> 07:33.625
I'm really trying.

07:33.625 --> 07:35.375
I'm right here.
‐ I'm right here.

07:35.375 --> 07:39.000
‐ I want this to work out.
‐ I do too.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.542
‐ Hello, everyone.

07:49.583 --> 07:52.750
I truly appreciate you all
meeting with me again.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.333
I, um,

07:54.333 --> 07:57.625
I know our last interaction
was less than ideal.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.708
But my therapist says

07:59.708 --> 08:01.333
it's never too late
to apologize.

08:01.333 --> 08:04.542
‐ Well, sounds like you have
a terrific therapist.

08:06.625 --> 08:10.167
‐ So I have brought
numerous articles

08:10.167 --> 08:14.917
from major publications
about the dangers of OxyContin

08:14.917 --> 08:18.333
that has put Purdue
on the defensive.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.250
Public pressure is building.

08:21.250 --> 08:25.542
‐ I have also seen several
articles about DEA overreach.

08:25.542 --> 08:28.083
‐ Yeah, well, those stories
were planted by Purdue.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.750
‐ Deputy Director Meyer,

08:30.750 --> 08:33.708
are you aware that
there are millions of people

08:33.708 --> 08:35.833
who swear by this medication?

08:39.042 --> 08:42.542
‐ There are just as many lives
that are being destroyed by it.

08:42.542 --> 08:44.792
And I'm not just talking
about the ones who have died,

08:44.792 --> 08:47.000
but the lives that they touch.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.500
Their friends, their family.

08:49.500 --> 08:53.542
Communities are being ravaged
by crime over this drug.

08:53.542 --> 08:57.333
Marriages and friendships
have ended

08:57.333 --> 09:01.375
because of a pill
that, in some instances,

09:01.375 --> 09:03.625
neither person
has ever even taken.

09:07.583 --> 09:10.167
‐ The FDA's position
on OxyContin

09:10.167 --> 09:12.708
is that it is safe
when used as directed.

09:12.708 --> 09:15.917
But we would take action
against it

09:15.917 --> 09:18.833
if the drug was shown to be
unsafe when used as prescribed.

09:18.833 --> 09:22.417
‐ But determining the safety
of the drug is the FDA's job.

09:22.417 --> 09:23.958
‐ And we have already
carried out our job

09:23.958 --> 09:25.667
during the approval process.
‐ Well, what if you were wrong?

09:25.667 --> 09:28.542
‐ Bridget.
‐ It's possible.

09:28.542 --> 09:30.875
‐ The FDA would admit
we were wrong,

09:30.875 --> 09:32.875
if that was proven
to be the case.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.792
‐ So if I were to prove
that OxyContin is dangerous

09:38.792 --> 09:42.375
when taken as prescribed,
then the FDA would act?

09:42.375 --> 09:45.625
‐ Absolutely. We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

09:45.625 --> 09:48.958
But we need proof that
the drug itself is defective

09:48.958 --> 09:50.125
if we are going
to take a drastic

09:50.125 --> 09:52.625
and restrictive action
against any drug,

09:52.625 --> 09:57.708
especially one that millions of
people have come to rely upon.

09:57.708 --> 10:00.375
How many are dying?
Who is dying?

10:00.375 --> 10:03.333
And how are they dying?

10:03.333 --> 10:04.667
This is what I want to know.

10:04.667 --> 10:07.375
‐ I'm sorry, what exactly
are you asking for?

10:07.375 --> 10:10.083
‐ I want you to pull together
all the data we have

10:10.083 --> 10:12.208
on overdose deaths
from OxyContin,

10:12.208 --> 10:15.458
and I want them organized
by state and region.

10:15.458 --> 10:19.375
‐ The DEA doesn't have
data on overdoses.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.292
‐ What do you mean‐‐you don't?
‐ No.

10:21.292 --> 10:22.875
That information
would be spread out

10:22.875 --> 10:25.083
across the country,
state‐by‐state,

10:25.083 --> 10:28.708
or even county‐by‐county,
patchwork of isolated reports.

10:28.708 --> 10:30.333
It would be incredibly
difficult to gather it all.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.333
‐ Well, I'm a very
difficult woman.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.000
Let's do it.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.375
‐ Are you joking?
‐ No, I'm not.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.000
I want to do
an exhaustive study

10:38.000 --> 10:41.417
on OxyContin overdose deaths,
and this is key‐‐

10:41.417 --> 10:43.583
I want to know
how many of those deaths

10:43.583 --> 10:45.708
are coming from people
who are taking the drug

10:45.708 --> 10:47.917
exactly as prescribed.

10:47.917 --> 10:51.375
Is that something you can
ascertain from the autopsy?

10:51.375 --> 10:53.375
‐ Potentially, yes, but,

10:53.375 --> 10:55.292
just to be clear,
so you understand

10:55.292 --> 10:57.125
exactly what you're asking for.
‐ Okay.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.250
‐ We're going to
have to go through

10:58.250 --> 11:00.125
thousands of autopsies
individually,

11:00.125 --> 11:01.708
match autopsies
with police reports,

11:01.708 --> 11:03.750
and dig through
handwritten notes.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.917
It will take
quite a bit of time.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.833
‐ I don't care
how much time it takes.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.375
Morning, Rick.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.542
Happy anniversary.

11:21.542 --> 11:23.292
We opened the case
three years ago.

11:23.292 --> 11:25.167
I was gonna get you
rhubarb pie,

11:25.167 --> 11:26.708
but the bakery was out.

11:26.708 --> 11:30.083
Feels like
a long three years.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.542
Still haven't even begun
to nail a top executive.

11:32.542 --> 11:34.125
‐ Come on, man.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.208
We were so close
to a whistleblower.

11:36.208 --> 11:37.875
And we're gonna
find another one.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.833
We're solid on misbranding.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.333
We can show the 1% claim
was fraudulent.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.083
So, I mean,
there's a lot here for a jury.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.250
‐ I'm not worried about a jury.

11:45.250 --> 11:48.625
I'm‐‐I'm worried
about Main Justice,

11:48.625 --> 11:51.708
because you know
who's gonna go out and lobby

11:51.708 --> 11:55.000
everyone he knows there,
and I just don't want

11:55.000 --> 11:58.625
this case to get
brushed under the rug.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.708
But if we start charging
individuals with felonies,

12:00.708 --> 12:03.667
we need the kill shot.

12:03.667 --> 12:06.458
‐ What was the name of that
U.S. Attorney up in Maine?

12:06.458 --> 12:08.000
‐ Jay McCloskey?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.667
‐ Did he dig
into Purdue at all?

12:09.667 --> 12:11.750
I think he had
a few meetings with them,

12:11.750 --> 12:13.625
but nothing significant
came from it.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.792
I'll reach out to him.

12:14.792 --> 12:17.625
I think
he's in private practice now.

12:17.625 --> 12:19.917
‐ We should look
into the doctors again.

12:19.917 --> 12:21.958
See if we missed something.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.667
‐ Like what?
‐ Some sort of kickback scheme.

12:24.667 --> 12:28.458
Or maybe an illegal promotion
that we can tie back

12:28.458 --> 12:29.833
to upper management.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.458
‐ If we circle back
to the doctors,

12:31.458 --> 12:32.667
we should start with the ones

12:32.667 --> 12:34.875
that we busted
for over‐prescription.

12:34.875 --> 12:38.042
Maybe after a few years
sitting in jail,

12:38.042 --> 12:39.833
they'd be willing
to tell us more.

12:39.833 --> 12:41.042
‐ Oh, yeah.

12:41.042 --> 12:43.250
‐ And I'll reach out
to Jay McCloskey.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.583
‐ Sounds good.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.583
I'm gonna get to it.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.375
Hey.

12:53.542 --> 12:56.208
Happy anniversary.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.500
You said it.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.667
‐ Tonight, we celebrate
OxyContin

13:06.667 --> 13:11.000
passing $1 billion
a year in sales!

13:11.000 --> 13:13.417
Yeah!

13:13.417 --> 13:16.458
Two years ahead of schedule.

13:19.292 --> 13:22.208
Everyone at HQ
sends their best wishes,

13:22.208 --> 13:24.583
and they want you all to know
that there's no way

13:24.583 --> 13:26.375
they could have done this
without you.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.000
‐ That's right.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.625
Hey, we have a hot line
to the cab company tonight,

13:30.625 --> 13:32.833
in case, you know,
you slip yourself an OxyContin.

13:32.833 --> 13:34.042
‐ So let's get this party

13:34.042 --> 13:35.875
started, all right? DJ!

13:37.000 --> 13:38.875
Yeah!

13:38.875 --> 13:40.458
It's about that time
to make way

13:40.458 --> 13:42.292
on the dance floor right now.

13:42.292 --> 13:43.917
Hope you got your drinks.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.083
I'ma have a Long Island
at the bar.

13:52.542 --> 13:53.833
‐ Hey, thanks, man.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.792
Can I get another one
straight away?

14:02.250 --> 14:04.042
Another one?

14:05.417 --> 14:06.750
So when I show up
for the first time,

14:06.750 --> 14:08.167
it's00 in the morning,

14:08.167 --> 14:09.792
and there's literally‐‐
it's like a tailgate party.

14:09.792 --> 14:11.167
- Are you serious?
- I shit you not.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.875
They're drinking beers
in the parking lot

14:12.875 --> 14:14.667
with a line out the door.
‐ Shit.

14:14.667 --> 14:17.750
‐ It's wild. I literally work
one day a month.

14:17.750 --> 14:20.458
‐ You're a fucking asshole.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.833
Working one day a month.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.708
Did you say something,
buddy?

14:24.708 --> 14:26.375
- Who's this guy?
- Oh, me?

14:26.375 --> 14:28.083
Yeah.
‐ Oh, I said, um,

14:28.083 --> 14:30.083
I said you're
a fucking asshole.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.750
Did you not hear?
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.167
Man, calm down.
This fool's just‐‐

14:33.167 --> 14:35.125
‐ No, man, I'm just
talking to my new buddy, man.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.500
You got a fucking
problem, dude?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.000
‐ Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.708
‐ That's quite a shove.
‐ Sorry, he's totally wasted!

14:40.708 --> 14:42.000
‐ Yeah.
You should be careful, though,

14:42.000 --> 14:43.083
'cause I could have
spilled it on your suit.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.458
‐ Come on, let's go.
‐ You too.

14:44.458 --> 14:45.875
You should keep
your little poodle on a leash.

14:45.875 --> 14:49.583
Jesus.
We are literally still at work.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.917
What's wrong with you?

14:53.917 --> 14:55.292
‐ I don't know.

14:56.958 --> 14:58.417
You're drunk.

14:58.417 --> 15:01.833
Come on, let me take you home
and take advantage of you.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.167
‐ Do you even like me, Amber?

15:07.917 --> 15:10.250
Even a little bit?

15:12.625 --> 15:14.208
‐ Sure, I do.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.083
‐ That was very convincing.

15:22.167 --> 15:24.000
Excuse me, colleagues.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.958
For the Lord is my shepherd.

15:29.958 --> 15:32.208
I shall not want.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.750
He maketh me lie down
in pastures.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.542
He restoresth my soul.

15:37.958 --> 15:39.042
The Lord is with us all.

15:39.042 --> 15:41.208
Lord Jesus,

15:41.208 --> 15:42.792
help our dear Betsy

15:42.792 --> 15:45.042
in the struggle
against addiction.

15:45.042 --> 15:47.042
Yes, Father!

15:47.042 --> 15:50.125
Give her strength
to fight this battle.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.875
Hear our cry, oh, Lord!

15:53.542 --> 15:56.250
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

15:56.250 --> 15:57.458
let her be free!

15:57.458 --> 15:59.042
Let her be free!

15:59.042 --> 16:00.708
Let her be free!

16:00.708 --> 16:02.750
- Let her be free!
- Let her be free.

16:02.750 --> 16:03.958
‐ Let me be free!

16:03.958 --> 16:05.667
Let her be free!

16:05.667 --> 16:06.917
‐ Let me be free!

16:06.917 --> 16:08.125
Let her be free!

16:08.125 --> 16:09.333
‐ Let me be free!

16:09.333 --> 16:11.042
Let her be free!

16:11.042 --> 16:13.042
‐ Let me be free!
Yes.

16:21.333 --> 16:24.542
Betsy, you, uh‐‐you okay?

16:29.417 --> 16:31.083
‐ Pastor, uh...

16:33.333 --> 16:37.333
I'm worried that, uh...

16:37.333 --> 16:40.167
this isn't gonna work for me.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.083
‐ Why is that?

16:46.542 --> 16:48.708
‐ I never believed.

16:51.792 --> 16:55.500
In any of this.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.083
Ever since I was a little girl.

16:58.083 --> 17:01.500
But your‐‐
your folks told me

17:01.500 --> 17:04.250
you been going to church
your whole life.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.208
‐ I did it for them.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.208
‐ Well, perhaps part of it
was for you too,

17:10.208 --> 17:12.500
without you even knowing it.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.333
You've always been
near the Lord.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.333
He's always loved you.

17:20.292 --> 17:22.583
‐ Do you think
He can help me now?

17:22.583 --> 17:27.000
‐ Oh, yes. He can.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.958
But you have to accept Him
into your heart.

17:28.958 --> 17:30.667
And when you do,

17:30.667 --> 17:31.958
He'll guide you out
of this darkness.

17:31.958 --> 17:35.292
He'll cast that devil
right out of your soul.

17:35.292 --> 17:36.667
'Cause He loves you,
Betsy Mallum,

17:36.667 --> 17:39.125
and deep down inside,
you've always loved Him.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.583
‐ Maybe I‐‐maybe I have.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.167
Of course you have.

17:45.167 --> 17:48.625
That's what led you
to church every Sunday.

17:48.625 --> 17:52.958
And that love will lead you
to the path of recovery.

17:56.333 --> 17:59.292
Would you like to pray with me?

18:13.833 --> 18:16.917
I'm kind of worried,
to be honest with you.

18:16.917 --> 18:20.833
I mean, the recidivism rate is
awfully high in these places.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.333
People keep coming back.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.500
What if it just doesn't work?

18:28.500 --> 18:31.042
‐ I've been sober 14 years,
seven months,

18:31.042 --> 18:32.708
three weeks, two days.

18:32.708 --> 18:35.750
So many have been saved
by this program.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.417
‐ What were you addicted to?

18:40.417 --> 18:43.000
‐ I'm a recovering alcoholic.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.208
‐ Well, I'm on OxyContin.
Yeah?

18:45.208 --> 18:48.000
And this place‐‐

18:48.000 --> 18:50.708
this place used to be
90% alcohol and cocaine,

18:50.708 --> 18:55.042
and in the past two years,
it's 90% OxyContin.

18:55.042 --> 18:57.917
It's all addiction, Samuel.
‐ Yeah.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.208
It's all the same fight.

19:00.208 --> 19:02.042
‐ Okay.

19:02.042 --> 19:04.458
‐ I want to talk
about the early days,

19:04.458 --> 19:07.750
when you first
started prescribing.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.958
Did Purdue give you
any kickbacks?

19:09.958 --> 19:13.333
‐ Just the usual stuff.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.625
Expensive dinners,
tickets to football games.

19:16.625 --> 19:21.292
I went to a few of their
weekend seminars in Orlando.

19:21.292 --> 19:24.250
‐ Anything specific about
those weekends that you recall?

19:25.708 --> 19:28.167
‐ Pretty girls.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.458
Stuffed animals.

19:30.458 --> 19:35.042
They made a great case
for why the drug was so safe.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.583
‐ What did they say?

19:37.583 --> 19:40.000
‐ That it was
basically non‐addictive

19:40.000 --> 19:42.958
because
of its time‐release system.

19:42.958 --> 19:44.875
The FDA label
was a big part of it.

19:47.875 --> 19:50.458
And the blood charts.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.958
‐ Blood charts. So these‐‐

19:51.958 --> 19:54.250
these are the ones
that showed that the drug

19:54.250 --> 19:56.833
plateaued in the bloodstream
instead of spiked.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.667
‐ Yeah, those.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.000
‐ Explain those to me,
would you?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.542
'Cause I‐‐like,
I don't always get the science.

20:02.542 --> 20:06.375
‐ Charts show that the drug
remained smooth and even

20:06.375 --> 20:08.542
in the blood
because of the timed release,

20:08.542 --> 20:10.500
versus the drug spiking
up and down in the blood

20:10.500 --> 20:12.708
of an immediate‐release pill,
like Vicodin.

20:12.708 --> 20:14.000
‐ Mm.
This made the drug

20:14.000 --> 20:15.417
less prone to abuse,

20:15.417 --> 20:18.500
'cause it didn't give the user
a feeling of euphoria.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.750
‐ And you found that
these charts swayed you

20:23.750 --> 20:25.292
on the drug's safety.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.375
‐ Oh, definitely.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.500
It was the phrase they used.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.833
‐ Fewer peaks and valleys.

20:32.833 --> 20:36.583
‐ I hadn't heard that before,
and it felt safe.

20:40.208 --> 20:43.542
‐ But the drug is not safer.

20:46.875 --> 20:49.833
Then...

20:49.833 --> 20:53.125
wouldn't the charts...

20:53.125 --> 20:57.500
be false?

20:57.500 --> 21:01.542
‐ Yeah.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.208
You might be right.

21:05.208 --> 21:07.125
‐ Oh, this chart
is absolutely deceptive.

21:07.125 --> 21:08.750
See, right here.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.833
The Y‐axis is
on the logarithmic scale,

21:10.833 --> 21:13.625
not a linear one,
like most normal charts.

21:13.625 --> 21:16.000
So the top number is 100 mg.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.208
Now, on a normal linear scale,

21:18.208 --> 21:21.167
this number halfway down
would be 50.

21:21.167 --> 21:23.667
But see what Purdue did?

21:23.667 --> 21:26.667
They dramatically
compressed the scale.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.750
See here, from 10 to 50,

21:29.750 --> 21:32.625
and then from 50 to 100.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.792
‐ What does that mean?

21:35.792 --> 21:37.625
‐ It's been manipulated.

21:37.625 --> 21:40.667
The Purdue chart hides the fact
that OxyContin's blood levels

21:40.667 --> 21:42.667
actually drop precipitously
in the first few hours.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.708
If we look at
the non‐manipulated chart,

21:44.708 --> 21:45.833
we see how it should look.

21:45.833 --> 21:48.542
Even intervals
all the way up the axis,

21:48.542 --> 21:53.000
that shows spikes and drops,
like all opioids have.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.833
‐ So you're telling us that
these OxyContin blood charts,

21:56.833 --> 21:59.208
they deliberately
created a false impression.

21:59.208 --> 22:00.542
100%.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.625
This is a false plateau.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.625
And unless you're
a trained data scientist,

22:04.625 --> 22:06.833
you wouldn't catch it.

22:06.833 --> 22:10.208
What's really strange to me
is why the FDA approved it.

22:10.208 --> 22:11.917
‐ This would require
FDA approval?

22:11.917 --> 22:13.917
They approve all these charts.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.750
And there's no way they'd miss
the log scale manipulation.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.125
The only way this chart
makes it through

22:18.125 --> 22:22.875
the FDA approval process
is if they turned a blind eye.

22:27.833 --> 22:29.083
There is a deep connection

22:29.083 --> 22:31.458
between drugs and terrorism.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.458
It's history,

22:33.458 --> 22:35.875
but it also reflects
today's reality.

22:35.875 --> 22:38.833
And no one knows this more
than our guest of honor,

22:38.833 --> 22:40.417
Time Magazine's Man of the Year

22:40.417 --> 22:43.125
for his leadership
in the wake of 9/11,

22:43.125 --> 22:44.833
and my good friend,

22:44.833 --> 22:46.167
Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

22:50.417 --> 22:55.083
Thank you, Asa.
Thank you.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.583
Thank you, thank you.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.625
I'd like to thank those

22:59.625 --> 23:02.125
whose generosity
made this exhibit possible

23:02.125 --> 23:04.208
at the DEA Museum.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.542
Drug trafficking
funds terrorism.

23:06.542 --> 23:10.167
But beyond that,
they are both intended

23:10.167 --> 23:13.458
to break the spirit
of this great country.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.500
But that won't happen.

23:15.500 --> 23:18.500
Not with the hard work
of the DEA.

23:20.917 --> 23:24.042
Deputy Director Meyer, correct?

23:26.250 --> 23:28.875
‐ Yes, sir.
I'm sorry. I'm just‐‐

23:28.875 --> 23:31.333
it's such an honor to meet you.

23:31.333 --> 23:34.625
What you have done for
this country was unbelievable.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.792
‐ So important for all of us.
Thank you.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.583
‐ I lost two friends
in the South Tower.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.583
‐ I'm so sorry.

23:40.583 --> 23:44.500
I'm so sorry.
‐ Thank you.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.042
‐ But I have to say
the honor is mine.

23:48.042 --> 23:50.917
You are the highest‐ranking
woman in the DEA, correct?

23:50.917 --> 23:53.708
‐ Yes, sir.

23:53.708 --> 23:55.167
‐ I've heard really
great things about you,

23:55.167 --> 23:57.250
and I'd love to chat.

23:57.250 --> 23:58.625
‐ I would be honored. Any time.

23:58.625 --> 24:00.417
‐ How about right now?

24:00.417 --> 24:01.958
‐ Uh, sure.

24:01.958 --> 24:03.375
Great.

24:04.792 --> 24:09.292
You may not know this,
but I'm a cancer survivor.

24:09.292 --> 24:11.625
I did know.
And I am so sorry.

24:11.625 --> 24:13.375
Thank you so much.

24:13.375 --> 24:16.250
I got through it,
and because of my experience,

24:16.250 --> 24:19.042
I truly understand
the pain and distress

24:19.042 --> 24:20.875
that accompany illness.

24:20.875 --> 24:25.208
I just started a new firm,
and I had to really think hard

24:25.208 --> 24:27.333
about what kinds of cases
I would take on.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.042
And after what I went through,

24:29.042 --> 24:31.958
I felt like I was
in a unique position

24:31.958 --> 24:34.375
to represent Purdue Pharma.

24:34.375 --> 24:35.875
I'd love for you
to come to my office

24:35.875 --> 24:38.458
sometime in the next week
and see a presentation

24:38.458 --> 24:41.625
that I put together
on OxyContin.

24:41.625 --> 24:44.833
I think Purdue has

24:44.833 --> 24:46.625
a wonderful drug.

24:46.625 --> 24:49.042
And they're doing
all that they can

24:49.042 --> 24:52.208
to keep it
out of the wrong hands.

24:59.625 --> 25:00.750
‐ How much do you think

25:00.750 --> 25:02.833
Giuliani raised
for the DEA Museum?

25:02.833 --> 25:04.625
10 grand? 20?

25:04.625 --> 25:06.042
‐ Whatever it is,
it's not good.

25:06.042 --> 25:07.417
Yeah.
‐ And it's not good

25:07.417 --> 25:09.458
for your investigation.
This guy is a national hero.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.292
He's friends
with the president.

25:28.667 --> 25:30.917
‐ We finally heard
from Jay McCloskey,

25:30.917 --> 25:33.792
the U.S. Attorney in Maine.
‐ I know who he is.

25:37.208 --> 25:38.708
‐ Dr. Richard,

25:38.708 --> 25:40.875
you've become
very curt with me,

25:40.875 --> 25:43.958
and it's disrespectful.

25:45.125 --> 25:50.292
And frankly,
it's getting upsetting.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.583
‐ Jay McCloskey?

25:58.333 --> 26:00.875
‐ Yes.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.542
He's going to chair
a law enforcement conference

26:03.542 --> 26:08.000
on how to best deal with
the OxyContin issue.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.500
‐ That's good.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.750
‐ I agree.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.000
We need to keep this
a law enforcement issue

26:13.000 --> 26:14.542
and not a medical issue.

26:14.542 --> 26:18.042
He's‐‐he's invited us
to attend.

26:18.042 --> 26:20.208
And I think we should send
a small delegation

26:20.208 --> 26:22.917
to make clear we want to help
in any way we can.

26:22.917 --> 26:24.917
‐ Absolutely.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.875
We need him
to understand abusers

26:27.875 --> 26:30.792
are compromising life‐saving
medications.

26:30.792 --> 26:34.417
We need to keep
hammering the abusers.

26:41.875 --> 26:44.417
‐ You know,

26:44.417 --> 26:46.833
I actually think
you shouldn't attend.

26:49.292 --> 26:52.167
‐ Why not?

26:52.167 --> 26:55.542
‐ You have really passionate
feelings on addiction,

26:55.542 --> 26:58.458
and we need to be as politic
as possible right now,

26:58.458 --> 27:01.208
something that you, at times,

27:01.208 --> 27:04.542
are not very good at.

27:10.083 --> 27:12.083
‐ Hm.

27:26.208 --> 27:28.000
Fine.

27:32.417 --> 27:37.333
Just be sure
to hammer the abusers.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.167
I haven't shared
very much or spoken

27:44.167 --> 27:46.042
about anything in here, like‐‐

27:46.042 --> 27:49.208
like all‐‐all you guys did.

27:51.708 --> 27:56.125
So I want to‐‐
I want to apologize for that.

27:56.125 --> 27:58.125
I don't know
if all of you know this‐‐

27:58.125 --> 28:00.458
some of you might know‐‐
but I was a‐‐

28:00.458 --> 28:02.458
I was a physician

28:02.458 --> 28:06.375
who prescribed OxyContin

28:06.375 --> 28:09.542
to some of my patients.

28:09.542 --> 28:12.500
Some of these people,
I considered my friends.

28:15.750 --> 28:19.875
Some of them became addicted.

28:22.917 --> 28:25.917
Some of them died.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.458
Sometimes I think I'm the one
who should have died.

28:39.333 --> 28:42.208
These are just good,
decent people

28:42.208 --> 28:43.250
who thought
they could trust me,

28:43.250 --> 28:44.500
and I feel like
I betrayed them,

28:44.500 --> 28:47.708
and I feel like
I let them down.

28:53.292 --> 28:56.292
I'm just gonna have
to live with that.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.750
I don't even know if I'm ready

29:03.750 --> 29:05.625
to go out into the world,
but...

29:07.583 --> 29:10.792
Well, there you go.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.417
Guess I'll give it a shot.

29:16.792 --> 29:19.833
I don't know, I feel, uh,

29:19.833 --> 29:21.333
like I'm still addicted,
you know?

29:21.333 --> 29:24.125
Like‐‐like I still need it.

29:24.125 --> 29:27.125
Well, these feelings
don't magically go away.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.708
It's gonna feel
overwhelming at times.

29:29.708 --> 29:32.875
But it is important
to live one day at a time.

29:32.875 --> 29:33.875
You know?
‐ Yeah.

29:33.875 --> 29:37.083
‐ Wake up each morning,

29:37.083 --> 29:39.292
recommit to the process.

29:39.292 --> 29:41.708
‐ Okay. Well...

29:42.958 --> 29:44.792
‐ You have someone
picking you up?

29:44.792 --> 29:45.917
‐ Yeah.
‐ Good.

29:45.917 --> 29:48.500
‐ Yeah, I'll just wait here.
I do.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.625
‐ Hey.

29:50.625 --> 29:51.792
We're here if you need us.

29:51.792 --> 29:52.833
‐ Okay, thank you.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.417
‐ All right.

30:43.208 --> 30:47.333
Dear Lord, thank you
for this glorious meal.

30:47.333 --> 30:52.542
For my health,
my‐‐my recovery.

30:52.542 --> 30:55.333
But most of all,

30:55.333 --> 30:59.958
I want to thank you
for my wonderful parents,

30:59.958 --> 31:04.542
who have stuck with me through
the most horrible of times.

31:04.542 --> 31:08.125
I'm so lucky to have them.

31:08.125 --> 31:11.500
And to have you in my life,
dear Lord.

31:14.875 --> 31:17.208
I know I wouldn't make it
without you all here

31:17.208 --> 31:21.542
to protect me.

31:21.542 --> 31:23.042
Amen.

31:23.042 --> 31:26.375
‐ Amen.
‐ Amen.

31:26.375 --> 31:29.125
Bets, if you come away
from this

31:29.125 --> 31:31.792
with a greater love
of the Lord,

31:31.792 --> 31:34.333
I promise you
it'll be worth it.

31:36.167 --> 31:38.667
‐ I think so too.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.625
Dr. Finnix?

32:07.792 --> 32:09.417
Dr. Finnix.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.417
Dr. Finnix!

32:16.875 --> 32:20.500
Dr. Finnix?

32:20.500 --> 32:22.958
‐ One second.

32:24.792 --> 32:26.917
Hey.

32:26.917 --> 32:29.167
Hey, how you doing?

32:29.167 --> 32:31.500
‐ Are you joking?
You called me last night

32:31.500 --> 32:33.083
and said you were gonna
kill yourself.

32:35.542 --> 32:38.250
‐ I did?

32:38.250 --> 32:41.958
No, that's‐‐

32:41.958 --> 32:44.750
I wasn't serious.

32:46.875 --> 32:49.375
‐ Are you gonna invite me in?

32:49.375 --> 32:51.917
Yeah, please, come in.

32:51.917 --> 32:55.375
‐ I was on the night shift,
so I couldn't leave.

32:55.375 --> 32:57.292
I was worried sick about you.

33:00.375 --> 33:02.833
‐ Sit. Come on, sit down.

33:02.833 --> 33:06.208
How you doing? How you doing?

33:06.208 --> 33:07.833
You want some coffee
or something?

33:07.833 --> 33:09.917
‐ No. Thank you.

33:09.917 --> 33:12.500
‐ You want some juice?

33:12.500 --> 33:15.000
‐ You're using again,
aren't you?

33:18.208 --> 33:19.792
‐ Yeah.

33:27.833 --> 33:30.667
You know, rehab didn't work.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.250
I mean, you know,

33:32.250 --> 33:34.375
people over there
just keeps coming in and out,

33:34.375 --> 33:35.625
going back and forth.

33:35.625 --> 33:38.917
They come in, they go out,
they come in.

33:38.917 --> 33:42.208
‐ A doctor at the hospital
told me the same thing.

33:42.208 --> 33:44.875
He said those places
work better for alcohol.

33:44.875 --> 33:49.375
That recovery is a lot harder
for opiates.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.583
‐ It's damn near impossible.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.792
‐ Have you thought
about methadone?

33:57.792 --> 33:59.708
He said it might work.

33:59.708 --> 34:01.917
‐ Just get addicted, like,
trade one for the other one,

34:01.917 --> 34:05.542
'cause those guys‐‐
those Vietnam guys‐‐

34:07.667 --> 34:09.208
the vets I used to work with,

34:09.208 --> 34:11.250
they just called it
liquid handcuffs,

34:11.250 --> 34:14.458
'cause you just‐‐
you know, just‐‐same thing.

34:14.458 --> 34:16.792
Well, you gotta try something.

34:16.792 --> 34:18.375
‐ Yeah.

34:19.708 --> 34:23.583
‐ I asked around, and there's
a good clinic in Knoxville.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.958
It's worth a shot, Dr. Finnix.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.750
‐ I'm not a doctor anymore.

34:30.750 --> 34:32.792
‐ I don't care what you are.

34:32.792 --> 34:36.208
I just don't want you dead.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.750
Can't you at least try it?

34:51.125 --> 34:54.208
I'm sorry, we have
to postpone St. Moritz.

34:54.208 --> 34:57.250
‐ But the kids are really
looking forward to it.

34:57.250 --> 35:00.042
I mean, David won't shut up
about those new skis.

35:00.042 --> 35:01.708
It's‐‐it's only two weekdays.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.208
‐ It's a very serious
situation.

35:03.208 --> 35:04.458
A U.S. Attorney in Maine

35:04.458 --> 35:06.208
is causing
some real problems for us.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.417
‐ What are you so afraid of?

35:10.417 --> 35:11.750
You're president.

35:11.750 --> 35:16.542
The drug is making
a billion a year.

35:16.542 --> 35:18.500
Why can't you just enjoy it?

35:22.375 --> 35:24.833
‐ Maybe I'm not capable of joy.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.792
‐ Then the kids and I
will go without you.

35:37.250 --> 35:38.833
‐ Okay.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.833
Well, thanks
for meeting with us.

35:55.833 --> 35:58.042
I know the FDA must be
pretty overwhelmed

35:58.042 --> 36:01.125
with approvals and such.

36:01.125 --> 36:04.000
‐ We are.
How can I help you?

36:04.000 --> 36:07.583
‐ We want to know
how the approval process works

36:07.583 --> 36:09.500
for scientific charts.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.917
‐ Well, any data
that a company wants to use

36:14.917 --> 36:17.625
in marketing and promotions

36:17.625 --> 36:22.458
has to be approved by us,
to ensure accuracy.

36:22.458 --> 36:27.125
‐ So if Purdue Pharma used
specific language in charts,

36:27.125 --> 36:29.875
then the FDA approved it?

36:29.875 --> 36:32.167
‐ That's correct.

36:32.167 --> 36:34.208
‐ We'd like to ask you

36:34.208 --> 36:36.458
about this blood chart
that sales reps at Purdue

36:36.458 --> 36:38.667
showed doctors to demonstrate
that the drug

36:38.667 --> 36:42.000
didn't have the same peaks
and valleys as other opiates.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.708
Would you guys give us
the room for a minute?

36:49.708 --> 36:52.208
- Sure.
- Thank you.

37:01.375 --> 37:04.375
Where did you get this?
‐ In discovery, at Purdue.

37:05.958 --> 37:08.958
‐ And you're sure that

37:08.958 --> 37:12.333
this is a chart that Purdue
reps actually showed doctors?

37:12.333 --> 37:13.917
‐ Mm‐hmm. A version of it.

37:13.917 --> 37:15.333
There are others
that are similar.

37:15.333 --> 37:19.583
‐ It was used in seminars
and for promotional purposes.

37:19.583 --> 37:21.125
‐ God damn it.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.667
‐ Is that a problem?
‐ Yes, that's a problem.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.500
That's a big problem.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.875
This chart has been manipulated

37:29.875 --> 37:31.625
to give
a false impression of the data.

37:31.625 --> 37:35.708
The scale in this column
has been deceptively numbered.

37:35.708 --> 37:37.625
Their drug actually spikes
like any opioid,

37:37.625 --> 37:40.208
not this bullshit plateau
that the graph claims.

37:40.208 --> 37:42.375
‐ Why'd the FDA approve it?

37:42.375 --> 37:44.125
‐ We didn't.

37:44.125 --> 37:45.708
We specifically told Purdue

37:45.708 --> 37:47.250
they could not
make these claims.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.792
I can give you the letter
we sent them years ago.

37:49.792 --> 37:52.583
And we rejected
the use of the term

37:52.583 --> 37:54.083
"fewer peaks and valleys,"

37:54.083 --> 37:56.208
as that is clearly
not accurate.

37:56.208 --> 37:59.000
‐ Are you aware that sales reps
at Purdue used this term

37:59.000 --> 38:02.750
as a major marketing tool?

38:02.750 --> 38:05.750
‐ Not until this conversation.

38:07.625 --> 38:09.667
Those fucking assholes
do this all the time!

38:09.667 --> 38:11.250
They just do whatever
the hell they want.

38:11.250 --> 38:15.417
And this division has been
pushing back on them for years.

38:15.417 --> 38:17.208
‐ And would you be willing
to testify to this

38:17.208 --> 38:20.792
before a grand jury?

38:20.792 --> 38:23.167
‐ Oh, gladly.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.500
U.S. Attorney McCloskey,

38:24.500 --> 38:27.208
esteemed participants,
thank you for including us

38:27.208 --> 38:30.167
in this important conversation
and for bringing this

38:30.167 --> 38:32.542
concerning topic
to our attention.

38:33.750 --> 38:36.208
‐ This is more than
just a concerning topic.

38:36.208 --> 38:37.708
It's a crisis in our state

38:37.708 --> 38:39.375
that stems
directly from your drug.

38:39.375 --> 38:42.042
I was reluctant
to include representatives

38:42.042 --> 38:44.417
from Purdue here today,
but we need all hands on deck,

38:44.417 --> 38:46.292
as this problem
continues to escalate.

38:46.292 --> 38:47.958
‐ And we want to do
what's right,

38:47.958 --> 38:49.458
so we've come up
with some solutions

38:49.458 --> 38:52.167
we believe
will be very effective.

38:52.167 --> 38:53.917
‐ Like what?

38:53.917 --> 38:55.375
‐ Doctor?

38:55.375 --> 38:56.875
Yes, at Purdue Pharma,

38:56.875 --> 38:59.958
we'll immediately commit to
hiring a team of expert

38:59.958 --> 39:02.458
independent consultants
to develop a strategy

39:02.458 --> 39:04.750
to educate physicians
on the ways to identify

39:04.750 --> 39:06.333
addicts and abusers.

39:06.333 --> 39:09.125
‐ This is Rick Mountcastle
calling for Jay McCloskey.

39:09.125 --> 39:12.917
I have tried several times,
and as a former U.S. Attorney,

39:12.917 --> 39:15.375
I'd expect that
he'd at least call me back.

39:15.375 --> 39:16.875
Mr. McCloskey apologizes.

39:16.875 --> 39:18.333
He's been very busy.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.333
He'll return your call
as soon as possible.

39:20.333 --> 39:23.000
‐ Thank you so much.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.792
‐ What will these experts
accomplish?

39:24.792 --> 39:26.208
‐ Phase one of their strategy

39:26.208 --> 39:27.917
will be to have
our sales team members

39:27.917 --> 39:29.500
conclude all of
their doctor's visits

39:29.500 --> 39:31.083
with a clear reminder:

39:31.083 --> 39:34.125
opioid‐based painkillers
are common targets

39:34.125 --> 39:36.917
for both drug abusers
and drug addicts.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.042
‐ Mm.

39:39.042 --> 39:41.292
‐ Maybe he's having
personal problems.

39:41.292 --> 39:42.750
‐ Mm.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.542
Or maybe he's an asshole.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.042
‐ Easy on the language.

39:46.042 --> 39:48.083
‐ Hey, guys.

39:48.083 --> 39:50.375
You don't need
to call him anymore.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.250
I literally just found out
why McCloskey's

39:52.250 --> 39:54.250
‐ not returning your calls.
Why's that?

39:54.250 --> 39:55.833
Mr. McCloskey,

39:55.833 --> 39:57.542
this is
a law enforcement issue.

39:57.542 --> 40:01.333
And the last thing Purdue wants
is for addicts and abusers

40:01.333 --> 40:03.292
to cause millions
of pain patients

40:03.292 --> 40:05.917
to lose access
to the only thing

40:05.917 --> 40:07.750
that provides them
with pain relief.

40:07.750 --> 40:09.208
‐ After he went
into private practice,

40:09.208 --> 40:11.250
take a wild guess
who he took on as a client.

40:11.250 --> 40:13.083
‐ No.
Yep.

40:13.083 --> 40:16.292
The former U.S. Attorney is
now representing Purdue Pharma.

40:17.875 --> 40:19.667
‐ I'll take it
under consideration.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.208
‐ They are buying off
everybody

40:21.208 --> 40:24.125
who's supposed to be
regulating them.

40:28.750 --> 40:32.708
‐ You know, Randy,
I owe you an apology.

40:32.708 --> 40:34.875
For what?

40:34.875 --> 40:37.875
‐ Jay McCloskey
really is an asshole.

40:41.208 --> 40:42.625
41‐year‐old male.

40:42.625 --> 40:45.458
Died in his sleep.
No respiratory arrest.

40:45.458 --> 40:49.083
No suicide note or
history of suicidal ideation.

40:49.083 --> 40:51.750
So this one is
a confirmed OxyContin death.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.750
‐ It is. But to be honest,

40:54.750 --> 40:57.750
we're running into
some serious issues.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.417
We threw out about
a third of the reports

41:02.417 --> 41:04.875
right off the bat, because
they're missing key info

41:04.875 --> 41:06.792
or are actually
unrelated deaths,

41:06.792 --> 41:08.750
like gunshot wounds or cancer.

41:08.750 --> 41:10.375
‐ Right, we expected that.

41:10.375 --> 41:11.917
‐ Right.

41:11.917 --> 41:14.833
But we didn't expect
the biggest hurdle.

41:14.833 --> 41:17.333
Nearly all the reports
show multiple drugs

41:17.333 --> 41:18.417
in the deceased's system,

41:18.417 --> 41:20.042
which we excluded
from the study,

41:20.042 --> 41:23.708
since we're trying to pin down
deaths from Oxy as prescribed.

41:23.708 --> 41:25.042
‐ So where does that leave us?

41:25.042 --> 41:27.333
What number are we at?

41:27.333 --> 41:29.417
‐ It's not
what you're looking for.

41:30.875 --> 41:32.167
So far, we've only found

41:32.167 --> 41:34.708
a dozen overdoses
with just oxycodone.

41:38.875 --> 41:40.083
‐ Just a dozen.

41:40.083 --> 41:43.125
‐ At this point,
we were expecting about 150.

41:43.125 --> 41:47.125
I'm happy to keep going,
but it's not promising.

41:47.125 --> 41:48.708
We could do this for months

41:48.708 --> 41:50.500
and barely triple
these numbers.

41:54.167 --> 41:56.958
‐ No, no, that's fine.

41:56.958 --> 41:59.958
We can stop.

42:01.667 --> 42:04.667
Thank you
for all the hard work.

42:42.083 --> 42:44.042
Honey.

42:44.042 --> 42:46.500
I TiVoed 24.
Should we watch it?

42:50.625 --> 42:52.125
Bridget.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.208
‐ Oh, um, yeah, sure.

42:56.208 --> 42:59.375
You okay?

42:59.375 --> 43:01.583
‐ You don't want
to hear about it.

43:04.250 --> 43:06.417
‐ Honey, I do.

43:11.167 --> 43:14.042
Hey, talk to me.

43:17.583 --> 43:19.583
Honey.

43:21.625 --> 43:25.375
‐ I met a kid a few years ago,

43:25.375 --> 43:26.833
in Kentucky.

43:26.833 --> 43:29.208
‐ Uh‐huh.

43:29.208 --> 43:32.292
‐ And interviewing him

43:32.292 --> 43:34.208
was the moment I realized

43:34.208 --> 43:37.083
that there was something
unique about the drug.

43:41.542 --> 43:45.375
He just died from an overdose.

43:54.208 --> 43:58.042
I could have done more.

43:58.042 --> 43:59.542
I could have worked harder...

43:59.542 --> 44:01.583
Come on, Bridget.
‐ And smarter.

44:01.583 --> 44:04.708
This is not your fault.

44:04.708 --> 44:08.083
‐ And I could have saved him.

44:08.083 --> 44:10.458
‐ You did not make this drug.

44:10.458 --> 44:11.708
You did not sell this drug.

44:11.708 --> 44:13.417
‐ I could have worked harder.
‐ Honey.

44:13.417 --> 44:16.417
‐ And I could have done more.
‐ Honey.

44:18.875 --> 44:20.833
This is not on you.

44:26.875 --> 44:29.875
‐ This is gonna sound strange.

44:33.625 --> 44:38.667
But I keep having this fantasy

44:38.667 --> 44:41.083
that I have Richard Sackler

44:41.083 --> 44:43.583
handcuffed to a chair.

44:48.125 --> 44:50.667
And I force him to watch
a video of all of the victims

44:50.667 --> 44:53.167
who have died from OxyContin.

44:57.500 --> 45:01.208
Make him face
all of his victims.

45:03.083 --> 45:06.167
All the lives
cut short for profit.

45:09.875 --> 45:13.875
All the tragedy
that he brought to families.

45:17.167 --> 45:19.792
All the communities destroyed

45:19.792 --> 45:22.125
for his family's greed.

45:25.417 --> 45:28.625
I just want him to see it all
with his own two eyes

45:28.625 --> 45:32.167
exactly what it is
that he has done.

45:36.042 --> 45:39.042
‐ But do you think
he'd even care?

45:43.833 --> 45:46.667
‐ No, he wouldn't, would he?

45:46.667 --> 45:48.750
Anyone who would do this
in the first place

45:48.750 --> 45:51.667
probably wouldn't at all.

45:51.667 --> 45:54.167
Wouldn't care.

46:03.542 --> 46:05.833
‐ Hello?

46:05.833 --> 46:08.333
‐ Hi, Vivian.

46:08.333 --> 46:10.917
It's Richard.

46:10.917 --> 46:12.625
‐ Hey, babe, I'll take this
in the other room.

46:12.625 --> 46:14.208
It's a friend.

46:20.375 --> 46:21.875
Hi, Richard.

46:23.125 --> 46:24.917
It's been a long time.

46:24.917 --> 46:27.583
At least 20 years?

46:27.583 --> 46:30.042
‐ Too long.

46:30.042 --> 46:32.333
How's your family?

46:32.333 --> 46:33.750
‐ They're good.

46:33.750 --> 46:35.625
Yours?

46:36.542 --> 46:39.875
‐ The company
is doing very well.

46:39.875 --> 46:42.125
‐ I heard. Congratulations.

46:42.125 --> 46:45.500
‐ Thank you.

46:48.583 --> 46:50.167
‐ And your wife.

46:50.167 --> 46:53.208
How's she doing?

46:53.208 --> 46:56.000
‐ She's good.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.042
‐ Well, I'm sure
your parents are pleased.

46:59.042 --> 47:01.875
I know they were
never fond of me.

47:04.375 --> 47:09.792
‐ I called to see if maybe

47:09.792 --> 47:12.833
we could get lunch sometime.

47:14.958 --> 47:16.958
‐ Um...

47:20.833 --> 47:24.792
No, I don't‐‐
‐ Yes, of course.

47:24.792 --> 47:26.917
Of course.

47:26.917 --> 47:29.667
Well, I‐‐I have to go.

47:29.667 --> 47:31.125
‐ Are you sure?
We can keep talking‐‐

47:31.125 --> 47:33.250
‐ Take care of yourself.
‐ Okay‐‐

47:53.375 --> 47:56.375
‐ You okay, sir?

48:07.958 --> 48:09.750
‐ Tell me about Maine.

48:09.750 --> 48:13.667
‐ Um, it went very well.

48:13.667 --> 48:15.917
I think we were able
to make clear to McCloskey

48:15.917 --> 48:17.375
this is
a law enforcement issue,

48:17.375 --> 48:18.875
and I didn't get the sense

48:18.875 --> 48:23.083
he's going to push
to regulate the medication.

48:25.083 --> 48:29.792
‐ He said he wants to keep
in open communication with us.

48:29.792 --> 48:32.292
‐ I think we definitely should.

48:32.292 --> 48:34.667
‐ Um, even so,

48:34.667 --> 48:38.625
with the U.S. Attorney
sniffing around,

48:38.625 --> 48:41.792
we might need to be
extra careful with

48:41.792 --> 48:43.792
what people
are putting in writing.

48:48.083 --> 48:50.958
We've begun the process
of creating an email system

48:50.958 --> 48:55.125
in which specified emails
instantly delete

48:55.125 --> 48:57.292
as soon as they've been read.

49:04.875 --> 49:08.000
‐ That's an excellent idea.

49:55.208 --> 49:59.583
Dear Lord,
help me defeat the Devil.

49:59.583 --> 50:02.875
Give me the strength
to shun his evil ways.

50:05.042 --> 50:09.042
I need You to help me
with temptation, dear Lord.

50:12.750 --> 50:14.875
Protect me from harm.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Keep me on the path
of the righteous.

50:24.042 --> 50:29.542
Guide me with Your wisdom
and Your love.

50:29.542 --> 50:32.458
I promise...

50:32.458 --> 50:37.208
I promise I will worship You
for all of eternity.

50:37.208 --> 50:39.500
Little Bets.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.833
Hey, girl.

50:40.833 --> 50:44.000
‐ Hey, Walt.
‐ How you doing?

50:44.000 --> 50:47.750
‐ Uh, listen.

50:47.750 --> 50:50.208
You got any Oxy?
‐ Yeah, no, no.

50:50.208 --> 50:51.542
I ain't had no Oxy in months.

50:51.542 --> 50:53.667
But, um,
I got something better.

50:53.667 --> 50:54.667
Get out of here.
Don't touch me!

50:54.667 --> 50:57.708
Get your hands off me!

50:57.708 --> 50:59.875
I'm sorry about that.
You all right?

50:59.875 --> 51:02.042
‐ I'm in real bad shape.
‐ Yeah.

51:02.042 --> 51:05.292
Well, I ain't got no OCs,
but I got some H.

51:05.292 --> 51:06.958
It's way cheaper,

51:06.958 --> 51:09.958
‐ and it's way better.
‐ Uh...

51:11.625 --> 51:12.792
‐ There ain't nothing
to be scared about.

51:12.792 --> 51:14.667
It's me.

51:14.667 --> 51:16.667
You know?

51:20.542 --> 51:22.542
Want to try it?

51:25.750 --> 51:27.042
‐ Okay.

51:27.042 --> 51:28.750
‐ Huh? Yeah, well, come on in.

51:28.750 --> 51:30.042
‐ All right.
‐ I'm sorry it's a mess.

51:30.042 --> 51:32.375
Come on. Yeah, come on in here.

51:32.375 --> 51:33.500
Make yourself comfortable.

51:33.500 --> 51:36.000
‐ Okay, okay.
‐ Good.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Yeah, warm up.

51:40.792 --> 51:42.583
Hey, you're gonna like it,
I promise.

51:42.583 --> 51:44.833
Take your jacket off.

52:10.958 --> 52:13.958
Sign in, please.

52:31.833 --> 52:33.667
Samuel.

52:41.875 --> 52:43.583
Other side, please.

52:50.750 --> 52:52.375
‐ Hello, Samuel.
Hi.

52:52.375 --> 52:54.708
‐ The doctor's gonna
start you on 35 mg.

53:26.625 --> 53:29.625
You'll get used to it.

53:33.958 --> 53:36.958
Now drink the water.

53:45.292 --> 53:47.167
Okay, have a seat.

53:47.167 --> 53:48.542
We need you to hang out
for an hour,

53:48.542 --> 53:51.208
just to make sure you don't
have a negative reaction.

53:51.208 --> 53:53.708
And after that,
I will see you here every day,

53:53.708 --> 53:56.542
bright and early,
seven days a week.

53:56.542 --> 53:58.083
‐ Okay.

53:58.083 --> 54:01.500
‐ Hey. Hard part's over.

54:01.500 --> 54:03.875
You're on the road
to recovery now.

54:05.500 --> 54:06.542
‐ Yeah.

55:16.375 --> 55:18.000
- Hello?
- Hey.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.542
Hey, sorry to, uh,
bother you so late.

55:20.542 --> 55:23.917
‐ No, no, I'm just catching up
on my non‐Oxy work.

55:23.917 --> 55:25.458
‐ Um, sorry about that.

55:25.458 --> 55:27.875
Don't be. What's up?

55:27.875 --> 55:32.542
‐ Um, I know a lot of other
drugs are commonly prescribed

55:32.542 --> 55:36.708
along with OxyContin,
like Xanax and antidepressants.

55:36.708 --> 55:39.042
Would it be possible
to separate out

55:39.042 --> 55:41.792
other non‐lethal
prescription drugs

55:41.792 --> 55:44.125
with Oxy in their systems?

55:44.125 --> 55:47.083
‐ Because those
drug combinations most likely

55:47.083 --> 55:49.667
would have been taken
as approved by the FDA.

55:49.667 --> 55:53.583
‐ Exactly, if we separate out
non‐lethal combos,

55:53.583 --> 55:55.875
then we end up
with a more accurate number

55:55.875 --> 55:58.542
of Oxy‐related
overdoses, right?

55:58.542 --> 56:00.042
Can you make that distinction?

56:00.042 --> 56:01.417
‐ Absolutely.

56:03.208 --> 56:05.333
Okay, we're likely missing
quite a few deaths

56:05.333 --> 56:06.833
that are just
too difficult to uncover.

56:06.833 --> 56:09.750
But even so, with the changes
to our methodology,

56:09.750 --> 56:13.250
the results
are frankly shocking.

56:19.042 --> 56:20.958
When combined with
non‐lethal medications,

56:20.958 --> 56:23.333
we found far more deaths
linked to OxyContin

56:23.333 --> 56:25.458
than had previously
been estimated.

56:25.458 --> 56:28.458
464.

56:30.375 --> 56:31.917
‐ 464.

56:31.917 --> 56:33.542
‐ Yeah, but that's
not the biggest thing.

56:33.542 --> 56:35.792
Only 12 of those
are the result of

56:35.792 --> 56:38.667
chewing, snorting,
or injecting,

56:38.667 --> 56:40.875
which means 98% of those deaths

56:40.875 --> 56:44.333
were the result of people
taking the pills orally,

56:44.333 --> 56:45.750
as directed.

56:45.750 --> 56:47.958
Our findings suggest
it's most probably

56:47.958 --> 56:50.875
not the abuser who's dying
from OxyContin consumption.

56:50.875 --> 56:52.792
‐ It's pain patients,

56:52.792 --> 56:55.875
who are taking the drug
exactly as prescribed.

56:55.875 --> 56:58.000
‐ Correct.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.708
They're the ones
dying from overdoses,

56:59.708 --> 57:01.292
based on these autopsies.

57:01.292 --> 57:03.125
My latest theory,
from all this new data,

57:03.125 --> 57:04.833
is that actual abusers

57:04.833 --> 57:07.750
are switching to cheaper drugs
like heroin.

57:09.542 --> 57:11.375
‐ This is exactly
what you needed to prove

57:11.375 --> 57:13.583
to the FDA, isn't it?

57:21.917 --> 57:23.917
‐ Could you excuse me
for a moment?

57:44.917 --> 57:47.125
I got you.

57:47.125 --> 57:50.542
I got you. I fucking got you.
I got you.

57:52.875 --> 57:54.042
I fucking got you.

57:54.042 --> 57:56.125
I fucking got you,
lying motherfuckers!
