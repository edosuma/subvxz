WEBVTT

00:13.888 --> 00:15.932
I won?

00:17.475 --> 00:18.518
I won!

00:20.812 --> 00:22.814
What are you doing? I won.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.400
That means you and I
are free to get back together.

00:25.942 --> 00:26.776
Right?

00:27.777 --> 00:29.529
Those are the rules of the league!

00:33.241 --> 00:35.118
Hey! Where are you going?

00:40.331 --> 00:43.418
Guys, did anyone get that fight on video?

00:43.418 --> 00:45.879
You guys leaving? Is there an after-party?

00:47.130 --> 00:48.381
What's going on?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.846
Where did everybody go?

00:56.723 --> 00:58.475
Is the show over?

00:58.475 --> 01:01.394
There was no show.
The bass player was punched to death.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.147
Did you say "punched to death"?

01:04.147 --> 01:07.108
As in to... death?

01:08.234 --> 01:10.487
Yes, those are the words I said.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.616
No!

03:47.268 --> 03:48.603
Ramona Flowers.

03:49.103 --> 03:52.398
The girl of, or from, Scott's dreams.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.651
Wallace. How are you?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.986
Well, I always liked wearing black.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.614
This is as good an excuse as any.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.407
Love the new hair.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.706
I can't believe he's gone.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.416
It's not a surprise, really.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.127
He was always
taking on high-level enemies.

04:13.127 --> 04:16.089
Yeah, but he always won.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.757
Nobody wins forever.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.133
The house does.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.804
Like casinos.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.598
I'm gonna sit next to someone else.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.436
Hey, you're the girl
that got Scott killed, right?

04:30.436 --> 04:31.646
It's good to meet you.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.898
- Ramona.
- Young Neil.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.112
I guess now I'll never know if we sucked.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.238
Which is kind of nice.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.283
I just wish it were
under different circumstances.

04:43.866 --> 04:44.909
I miss you, pal.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.009
You!

05:04.554 --> 05:08.391
What are you doing here?
You killed Scott Pilgrim!

05:09.058 --> 05:10.601
Did she say killed?

05:10.601 --> 05:11.853
This is juicy.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.398
I don't know if that's fair.

05:15.398 --> 05:19.902
Fair? You're responsible.
You're the one to blame.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.487
It's your fault!

05:21.988 --> 05:25.783
This has got to be the most
dramatic funeral I've ever been to.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.577
It doesn't get more dramatic.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.038
<i>Or does it?</i>

06:02.278 --> 06:03.404
Showtime!

06:05.573 --> 06:06.824
Envy Adams!

06:07.867 --> 06:10.828
No way! It's the real deal!

06:13.998 --> 06:15.124
Envy!

06:15.124 --> 06:17.585
Icon! Queen! Mommy!

06:37.063 --> 06:39.941
Envy Adams is amazing!

06:39.941 --> 06:42.693
She's the lead singer
of my favorite band of all time!

06:44.904 --> 06:48.116
The Clash at Demonhead?
I thought we were your favorite band.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.079
Well, they're my favorite real band.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.623
Sex Bob-omb is my favorite band
that isn't real.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.336
I'd like to thank you all
for coming out to see me.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.046
We love you, Envy!

07:02.046 --> 07:06.801
As you all know, I briefly dated
Scott Pilgrim in my pre-celebrity life.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.095
We didn't all know!

07:09.095 --> 07:13.641
And even though he was the least important
chapter of the book of my life,

07:13.641 --> 07:17.103
and even though I don't remember much
about our relationship at all,

07:17.770 --> 07:20.940
I thought I'd sing a song in his memory.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.740
<i>I will remember you</i>

07:31.367 --> 07:35.288
<i>Will you remember me?</i>

07:35.288 --> 07:37.665
Scott dated her?

07:37.665 --> 07:39.459
Crazy, right?

07:39.459 --> 07:43.546
Can you imagine having an ex who became
a huge celebrity after you broke up?

07:45.381 --> 07:52.221
<i>Weep not for the memories</i>

07:57.393 --> 08:03.024
<i>I'm so tired, but I can't sleep</i>

08:04.275 --> 08:09.864
<i>I'm standing on the edge
Of something much too deep</i>

08:11.115 --> 08:17.330
<i>It's funny how we feel so much
But we can't say a word</i>

08:17.330 --> 08:23.836
<i>We are screaming inside
But we can't be heard</i>

08:25.379 --> 08:30.468
<i>I will remember you</i>

08:32.178 --> 08:37.892
<i>Will you remember me?</i>

08:38.768 --> 08:45.775
<i>Don't let your life pass you by</i>

08:47.693 --> 08:53.908
<i>Weep not for the memory</i>

09:04.168 --> 09:05.419
"Dear Evil Ex."

09:05.962 --> 09:09.882
"All seven of you are cordially invited
to a very special evening."

09:16.681 --> 09:19.100
Did I just get invited to my own lair?

09:19.100 --> 09:25.523
<i>Weep not for the memory</i>

09:30.653 --> 09:34.073
Envy, I love you!

09:34.073 --> 09:37.410
- Envy! Sign my neck!
- Step on my corpse!

09:54.885 --> 09:56.095
I'm sorry, Scott.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.648
<i>New York City, America.</i>

10:18.868 --> 10:22.079
Mr. Lee, I'm a huge fan.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.831
Tell me something I don't know.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.982
- Todd.
- Lucas.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.655
Heard you started dipping your toes
in the waters of the acting game.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.239
I've had a few auditions.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.993
Maybe you should stick to the rivers
and the lakes that you're used to.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.703
Let the pros do the pro things.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.749
Vegans have perfect photographic memories.
I could memorize an entire script...

11:06.749 --> 11:08.250
just like that.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.169
I don't even read the scripts anymore.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.380
I just say the first thing
that pops into my head.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.923
It's called "being in the moment."

11:13.923 --> 11:17.802
Is that why half your lines
in your last movie were "Let's party!"

11:19.512 --> 11:21.055
Don't know. Didn't watch it.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.307
Drink, sir?

11:23.307 --> 11:24.266
Let's party.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.566
Sick lair, bro.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.361
Why'd you bring us here, Gideon?

11:37.113 --> 11:37.988
I didn't.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.991
The person behind this event
remains a mystery.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.746
Who invited the robot?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.624
No one did.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.630
For it is I who did the inviting.
Matthew Patel!

11:56.590 --> 11:58.092
The robot's with us.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.512
The first one we ever built.
We call him Robot-01.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.181
We gendered him, too. Male.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.100
He's our special little guy.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.853
This party was curated.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.022
No plus ones!

12:18.446 --> 12:22.074
I see none of you took my request
for cocktail attire seriously.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.993
I don't even know what that is.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.287
I thought it meant there'd be drinks.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.164
I was right.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.083
No matter.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.626
I brought you all here

12:32.626 --> 12:35.463
because I've realized
there's a fatal flaw in our league.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.465
A failure of leadership.

12:38.048 --> 12:41.469
Are you questioning my methods?

12:41.469 --> 12:44.680
I'm not questioning them.
I'm answering them.

12:47.767 --> 12:53.564
I, Matthew Patel, defeated Ramona's
new boyfriend and got nothing for it!

12:53.564 --> 12:55.775
Ramona has a new boyfriend?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.902
Sounds like she <i>had</i> a new boyfriend.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.028
Correct.

12:59.528 --> 13:04.241
His name was Scott Pilgrim,
and I punched him into the next life.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.659
Scott Pilgrim?

13:05.659 --> 13:09.955
The random Canadian guy whose funeral
was inexplicably attended by Envy Adams?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.249
She performed a song.
It was all over the news.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.836
That's right. My girlfriend, Envy Adams.

13:17.087 --> 13:21.050
We all know you're dating Envy Adams.
Act like you've been here before.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.344
Listen to me, all of you.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.806
If we win, we don't get Ramona.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.391
I flawlessly defeated
her precious little Scott,

13:29.391 --> 13:31.477
and she still turned me down!

13:32.061 --> 13:32.937
Gasp.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.024
You're the lowest-ranked evil ex.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.943
Why do you think you'd get the girl?

13:38.943 --> 13:41.320
You were fighting him so I'd get the girl.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.864
Wait, that's your plan?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.574
And the rest of us get nothing?

13:46.575 --> 13:48.828
Nothing? Sounds like a bad deal.

13:49.537 --> 13:54.875
I think this league needs a new direction
and a new evil ex in charge.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.546
You really think
I'd just hand the league over?

13:58.546 --> 14:01.549
No. I think I'll fight you for it.

14:04.885 --> 14:08.305
You versus me. Winner takes all.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.849
I'm Gideon Graves.

14:09.849 --> 14:15.312
I own two record labels, a movie studio,
14 animal shelters, and this league.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.275
You're a D-plus theater student
with delusional Broadway dreams.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.986
This is a joke. You're not worth my time.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.072
Sounds like somebody's scared.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.615
What did you just say?

14:26.615 --> 14:29.368
She said,
"It sounds like somebody's scared."

14:29.368 --> 14:34.206
That's what I thought she said,
but that's not me. No.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.835
Nothing's ever scared me!
My nickname in school was "Fearless."

14:37.835 --> 14:40.212
I wore "No fear" shirts every day!

14:40.796 --> 14:43.215
Sounds to me like
those shirts were a lie, bro.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.092
They weren't a lie!

14:45.676 --> 14:48.888
Then it's time for G-Man
to put his fists where his mouth is.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.357
You just made
the biggest mistake of your life.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.192
"Winner takes all"?

15:02.192 --> 15:03.736
That's what you propose?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.655
You think you stand a chance
against my power?

15:07.156 --> 15:10.200
Fine. These are my terms.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.413
If you win, you can take it all.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.374
The league, my empire, everything.

15:17.374 --> 15:23.422
But if you lose, which you will,
I take your life.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.091
I accept those terms.

15:26.675 --> 15:30.095
Then it's time for you to be reunited
with Scott Pilgrim

15:31.347 --> 15:32.723
in hell.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.988
<i>Gideon Graves versus Matthew Patel.</i>

15:49.573 --> 15:50.491
<i>Fight!</i>

16:10.219 --> 16:12.388
You're messing with a CEO, pal.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.307
No, we are.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.477
Come on, girls.

16:21.563 --> 16:22.564
Fireball!

16:37.997 --> 16:40.374
No! Lord Matthew!

16:46.630 --> 16:48.757
Go, Matthew! Go!

16:49.299 --> 16:51.301
<i>Let's get in the game!</i>

16:51.301 --> 16:53.137
I'm just getting started.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.890
Fly, girls! Full-court press!

17:04.857 --> 17:05.733
<i>Look out!</i>

17:12.072 --> 17:14.408
Slam dunk!

17:16.493 --> 17:17.745
He's on fire!

17:19.747 --> 17:21.540
Still think I'm a loser?

17:22.374 --> 17:24.126
I do.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.592
Time to take this fight to the next level.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.736
Patel!

17:51.487 --> 17:54.782
Damn it! Matthew, come on out...

17:56.033 --> 17:57.743
- Surprise attack!
- Surprise attack!

18:01.205 --> 18:02.456
Now, girls!

18:06.085 --> 18:06.960
Again!

18:11.548 --> 18:13.967
You're a D-plus fighter, too!

18:13.967 --> 18:14.968
How did he...

18:30.526 --> 18:32.402
Damn! End of the line.

18:32.945 --> 18:33.987
Oh no!

18:55.467 --> 18:56.593
Die!

19:24.329 --> 19:25.289
You're mine!

19:37.926 --> 19:41.388
This is what we in the business call
a reversal of fortune.

19:42.097 --> 19:42.931
It's over.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.649
What are you waiting for, Matt?
Finish him.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.446
I gotta stop eating meat.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.202
Finally!

20:08.290 --> 20:12.169
If I could just have
your signature right here, Mr. Graves.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.504
What... What's this?

20:14.504 --> 20:17.257
The result of this fight
is legally binding.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.760
Everything of yours
now belongs to Mr. Patel.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.470
Hey!

20:21.470 --> 20:22.888
My empire?

20:23.555 --> 20:25.057
My league?

20:25.057 --> 20:26.225
My lair?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.477
My home?

20:29.645 --> 20:31.480
My underwear?

20:31.480 --> 20:32.981
Those were the terms.

20:37.152 --> 20:37.986
Fine.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.536
Do it! Put me out of my misery!

20:47.079 --> 20:50.207
No. I want to put you into your misery.

21:01.593 --> 21:05.514
This is my league now.
I'm the main character.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.308
Here's to the new boss.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.353
"O Captain! My Captain!"

21:17.359 --> 21:18.318
Betrayed!

21:18.819 --> 21:19.945
By all of you!

21:19.945 --> 21:21.113
Lucas Lee?

21:22.864 --> 21:23.824
Todd?

21:27.536 --> 21:28.370
Twin?

21:28.870 --> 21:30.038
Other twin?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.298
<i>Et tu,</i> Roxanne?

21:39.798 --> 21:41.967
<i>Et tu?</i> Eat me.

21:41.967 --> 21:46.221
Wait, Roxie.
I never properly appreciated you before.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.683
You have something the other exes don't.

21:49.683 --> 21:53.312
And that's why you should join me.
We could be a league of two.

21:54.104 --> 21:56.315
I don't need a league to get a girl.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.859
Have a nice life, loser.

22:55.957 --> 22:58.960
You look like you're dying.
Let me get you a blanket.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.393
Sparks.
