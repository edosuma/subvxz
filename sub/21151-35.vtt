00:01.702 --> 00:05.005
Captioning funded by CBS
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER"!

00:05.039 --> 00:07.641
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, CHRISTMAS,
WANTED TO TAKE OUT THE COWBOY.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.810
>> JASON IS MY NUMBER 1 TARGET.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.179
ALEX IS MY BACKUP.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.682
WE HAVE TO SPLIT THIS SUPER
COUPLE.

00:14.715 --> 00:18.252
>> BUT WOULD A FAKE TARGET ON
THE BLOCK --

00:18.286 --> 00:19.987
>> KEVIN, TAKE A SEAT.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.057
>> JASON AND ALEX THOUGHT KEVIN
WAS GOING HOME.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.793
>> ALL MY WORRYING WAS FOR
NOTHING.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.062
LOOKS LIKE KEVIN WAS GOING HOME.

00:28.096 --> 00:34.001
DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER TO HAVE A
TEAM LIKE PAUL AND ALEX.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.505
>> PAUL CAME UP WITH A PLAN TO
SPLIT THE VOTES.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.874
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE IT A
TIEBREAKER.

00:40.908 --> 00:46.247
IF THE VOTES GO 3-1, ALL OF US
WERE IN ON THIS TO GET ONE OF

00:46.280 --> 00:48.182
THEM OUT.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.985
IF THERE'S A TIEBREAKER, YOU CAN
TAKE WHATEVER HEAT, RIGHT?

00:52.019 --> 00:55.055
>> JOSH THOUGHT IT BENEFITTED
PAUL MORE THAN THEM.

00:55.089 --> 00:59.460
>> I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT THIS
PLAN THAT PAUL PUT IN MOTION.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.896
IT PROTECTS PAUL AND THE FINGERS
ARE POINTED AT ME AND KRISTIN

01:02.930 --> 01:04.632
AND THE BLOOD IS ON OUR HANDS.

01:04.665 --> 01:08.302
>> AND HE WAS RIDDEN WITH GUILT
OVER HIS PART IN JASON'S DEMISE.

01:08.336 --> 01:12.306
>> WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

01:12.340 --> 01:17.345
>> BEFORE THE EVICTION, JULIE
MADE A HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT.

01:17.378 --> 01:21.249
>> IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER DOUBLE
EVICTION NIGHT.

01:21.282 --> 01:26.154
>> AFTER PAUL'S TIE VOTE PLAN
CAME TO FRUITION --

01:26.187 --> 01:28.021
>> I VOTE KEVIN.
>> JASON.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.022
>> KEVIN.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.558
>> JASON.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.992
>> WE HAVE A TIE.

01:32.025 --> 01:36.964
>> CHRISTMAS PUT THE FINAL NAIL
IN THE RODEO CLOWN'S BLINDSIDE.

01:36.997 --> 01:44.772
>> UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME, I
HAVE TO VOTE TO EVICT JASON.

01:44.805 --> 01:49.343
>> WITH ALEX DOWN, HER RIDE OR
DIE.

01:49.377 --> 01:52.012
SHE WON A DO-OR-DIE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

01:52.045 --> 01:58.919
>> CONGRATULATIONS, ALEX!
>> THE PERFECT SCORE.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.522
>> YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, ALEX.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.392
>> AND THE GAMER IMMEDIATELY
CHOSE HER TARGETS.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.093
>> I'M SORRY, KEVIN.

02:06.126 --> 02:10.097
I'M GOING TO NOMINATE YOU AND
RAVEN.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.399
I'M SORRY.

02:11.432 --> 02:19.373
>> WITH THE VETO ON THE LINE,
THE MEATBALL WAS THE MASTER OF

02:19.407 --> 02:20.374
THE BALL.

02:20.408 --> 02:24.077
AFTER JOSH KEPT ALEX'S
NOMINATIONS IN PLACE --

02:24.111 --> 02:27.581
>> I CHOOSE NOT TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.149
>> RAVEN WAS SENT TO JURY.

02:29.183 --> 02:34.655
>> RAVEN, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.191
TONIGHT, WITNESS THE MOMENTS YOU
DIDN'T SEE FROM ONE OF THE

02:37.225 --> 02:40.594
CRAZIEST DOUBLE EVICTIONS EVER.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.829
>> GET OUT.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.996
GET OUT.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.700
>> PLUS, A NEWS OF HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD WILL RISE TO POWER.

02:46.734 --> 02:53.941
IT'S THE WORLD PREMIER OF THE
B.B. COMIC'S MOVIE TRAILER "THE

02:53.974 --> 02:54.775
REVENGERS."

02:54.808 --> 03:07.921
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

03:07.955 --> 03:17.831
>> OH, MY GOOD.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.300
CONGRATULATIONS IT TO THE FINAL
FIVE.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.235
IT'S A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT.

03:21.269 --> 03:24.805
>> TONIGHT HAD THE BE THE
CRAZIEST NIGHT OF MY BIG BROTHER

03:24.838 --> 03:25.639
EXPERIENCE OVER.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.140
A DOUBLE ELIMINATION.

03:27.174 --> 03:33.247
JASON WENT HOME, RAVEN WENT
HOME.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.748
GUESS WHAT?

03:34.782 --> 03:37.918
ALL OF MY PLANS WORKED
PERFECTLY.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.254
EVERYBODY IS SO SHOCKED, THEY
CAN'T SPEAK.

03:40.288 --> 03:43.491
45 MINUTES AGO, IT WASN'T SO
QUIET.

03:43.524 --> 03:49.497
>> UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME I
HAVE TO VOTE TO EVICT JASON.

03:49.530 --> 03:54.935
>> IT'S OFFICIAL, JASON, YOU ARE
EVICTED FROM THE "BIG BROTHER"

03:54.968 --> 03:58.972
HOUSE.

03:59.006 --> 04:02.476
>> IT WASN'T ME, JASON.

04:02.510 --> 04:05.646
IT WASN'T ME.

04:05.679 --> 04:10.217
>> SO IF I WAS ON THE BLOCK, I
WAS GOING?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.251
>> I'M SORRY.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.354
>> I'M SORRY.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.989
HE'S TOO STRONG NOW.

04:16.023 --> 04:21.862
I'M SORRY.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.531
I'M SORRY.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.334
>> JASON WAS MY RIGHT OR DIE.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.236
HE WALKED OUT WITHOUT A HUG.

04:29.269 --> 04:37.378
I DON'T KNOW IF HE BELIEVES I
WASN'T PART OF IT.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.481
I DON'T LIKE NOT PROTECTING
PEOPLE I LOVE.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.782
JASON, I LOVED HIM.

04:41.815 --> 04:45.085
I WAS SO SURE THAT ME AND JASON
AND PAUL WERE GOING TO THE END.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.954
ONE OF US WAS GOING TO WIN.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.157
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT RAVEN AND
JOSH VOTED HIM OUT.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.492
I TRUST PAUL RIGHT NOW.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.127
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO AT THIS
POINT.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.464
>> I FEEL BAD FOR SENDING JASON
HOME.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.599
I LIKE WHO HE IS.

04:58.632 --> 05:03.337
BUT JASON BEING EVICTED IS
HELPFUL FOR MY GAME.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.805
HE'S A HUGE COMPETITOR.

05:04.838 --> 05:05.773
HE HAD TO GO.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.510
>> MY PAL, JASON, WAS EVICTED.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.578
HE WAS A 50/50 CHANCE.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.746
PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING
TO MAKE IT THIS FAR.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.182
>> SO I WAS ON THE BLOCK.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.684
I WAS GETTING EVICTED.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.951
>> I'M SO SORRY.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.754
>> YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
THING TO ME, JOSH?

05:20.788 --> 05:23.256
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
ME?

05:23.290 --> 05:24.492
>> YEAH.

05:24.525 --> 05:28.061
>> I CAN'T HAVE ALEX THINK I HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS PLAN.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.399
BECAUSE WE JUST SENT HER PARTNER
HOME.

05:31.432 --> 05:35.903
IF SHE THINKS I HAD ANYTHING TO
DO WITH IT, IT'S MY HEAD ON A

05:35.936 --> 05:37.137
STICK.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.973
SO A FEW DAYS AGO, JOSH AND I
CAME UP WITH A PLAN KEEPING ME,

05:40.007 --> 05:40.908
CHRISTMAS AND JOSH SAFE.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.910
>> SO THIS IS THE PLAN.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.713
CALL ME GOAT.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.582
ALEX WILL BE MAD.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.719
I'LL SAY THEY'RE COMING AFTER
US.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.820
TRYING TO BACK DOOR ME.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.423
THEY WANT TO TAKE US STRONG
COMPETITORS.

05:55.456 --> 06:00.628
THEN ME AND YOU NEED TO PICK A
FIGHT.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.496
WE TAKE A FIGHT.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.032
SO I'M DECLARING WAR AGAINST YOU
GUYS.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.401
IN HER HEAD, PAUL IS FIGHTING
WITH HIM.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.636
I DON'T NEED TO.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.337
HE'S FIGHTING MY BATTLES.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.707
YOU GET TO GET WHAT I'M SAYING?

06:13.741 --> 06:16.243
FAKING A FIGHT.
>> HOPEFULLY FAKING A FIGHT WILL

06:16.276 --> 06:19.480
BE ENOUGH TO THINK THAT WE'RE
NOT WORKING TOGETHER.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.149
THAT'S HOW YOU GET AWAY WITH TV
MURDER.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.986
>> GOOD PLAN OR YOU THINK IT'S
WEIRD?

06:26.019 --> 06:27.220
>> I THINK IT'S WEIRD.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.922
>> YOU HAVE ANOTHER OPTION?

06:28.956 --> 06:29.723
>> NO.

06:29.757 --> 06:30.924
>> OKAY, THEN.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.662
>> PAUL HAS THIS PLAN BUT IT
ONLY PROTECTS PAUL'S GAME AND

06:34.695 --> 06:35.295
EXPOSES MINE.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.897
I HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH IT.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.533
I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT IN
ORDER FOR ME AND CHRISTMAS TO

06:39.567 --> 06:42.970
MOVE FURTHER, I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO TRUST PAUL.

06:43.003 --> 06:47.508
>> WE NEED TO SWINDLE HER, DUDE.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.743
THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BEAT
HER.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.579
>> YOU GUYS ARE TOO STRONG?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.447
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

06:53.481 --> 06:57.050
>> YOU'RE TOO STRONG A
COMPETITOR.

06:57.084 --> 07:01.889
>> STOP TALKING, DUDE.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.423
>> WHAT DO WE DO?

07:03.457 --> 07:07.928
>> ALEX IS BLINDSIDED AND SHAKEN
UP FROM JASON'S EVICTION.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.864
>> I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.
>> I NEED TO MAKE SURE IF SHE

07:10.898 --> 07:15.569
WINS THE NEXT HOH, SHE DOESN'T
TAKE A SHOT AT ME, JASON OR

07:15.603 --> 07:17.471
CHRISTMAS BUT RAVEN AND KEVIN.

07:17.505 --> 07:20.373
>> WHAT DO WE DO?

07:20.407 --> 07:22.242
>> HOW IS THIS REAL?

07:22.275 --> 07:26.379
>> JOSH --
>> IF YOU WANT TO WIN THIS GAME,

07:26.413 --> 07:28.482
WE NEED TO BEAT CHRISTMAS AND
JOSH LATER.

07:28.516 --> 07:31.719
WE NEED TO PUT UP A STRONGER
FIGHT RIGHT NOW.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.120
RAVEN HAS TO GO.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.624
>> I COULD GO AFTER JOSH AND
CHRISTMAS TO GET REVENGE FOR

07:36.657 --> 07:37.525
JASON.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.992
PAUL WANTS ME TO GO AFTER RAVEN
AND KEVIN.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.530
SO I'M GOING AFTER PAUL'S PLAN
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY

07:42.563 --> 07:43.330
BESIDES HIM.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.099
>> JOSH, READY FOR THIS HOH,
BUDDY?

07:46.133 --> 07:48.669
>> CONGRATULATIONS, ALEX.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.605
>> THAT'S FOR YOU, JASON.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.406
THAT'S FOR YOU.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.408
>> WE JUST SENT JASON HOME.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.244
ALEX WON HOH.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.913
FINGERS CROSSED MY DAMAGE
CONTROL ACTUALLY WORKED.

07:59.947 --> 08:04.484
>> ALEX, AS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD,
IT'S TIME TO FACE YOUR HOUSE

08:04.518 --> 08:06.687
MATES AND MAKE YOUR TWO
NOMINATIONS.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.822
>> I'M SORRY, KEVIN.

08:08.856 --> 08:17.230
I NOMINATE YOU AND RAVEN FOR THE
VOTE.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.100
>> ME, JOSH AND CHRISTMAS SENT
ALEX'S RIGHT OR DIE OUT OF THIS

08:20.133 --> 08:25.939
GAME AND NONE OF US ARE ON THE
BLOCK RIGHT NOW.

08:25.973 --> 08:26.740
>> RELAX.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.608
IT'S A GAME.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.408
COME ON.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.544
>> YOU HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER,
JOSH.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.012
>> JOSH, STOP IT.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.982
WE ALL COLLECTIVELY DECIDED ON A
PLAN.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.385
I WORRY ABOUT HIM BEING
EMOTIONAL.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.553
IT CONSUMES HIM.

08:39.587 --> 08:44.892
HE GETS TUNNEL VISION WITH IT
AND SOMETIMES HE GOES ROGUE.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.260
>> I'M SO SORRY.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.396
>> YOU'LL MAKE IT UP TO ME
LATER.

08:49.429 --> 08:50.363
>> JOSH, STOP CRYING.

08:50.397 --> 08:54.401
>> STOP CRYING.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.103
>> I'M SORRY.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.805
>> LET'S PLAY.

08:57.838 --> 09:03.343
>> ALEX WITH FOUR LIVES.

09:03.376 --> 09:10.183
JOSH, CONGRATULATIONS!
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

09:10.217 --> 09:16.356
YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO
STRATEGIZE.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.091
>> MOVE, GET OUT.

09:18.125 --> 09:18.391
GET OUT.

09:18.425 --> 09:22.596
GET OUT.

09:22.630 --> 09:36.777
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

09:36.810 --> 09:41.481
>> RIGHT NOW I'M WORRIED I HAVE
ALL THE BLOOD ON MY HANDS FROM

09:41.514 --> 09:43.316
JASON'S EVICTION.

09:43.350 --> 09:48.021
IF THAT'S WHAT ALEX WANTS, MAYBE
I CAN BUY BACK GOOD WIN WITH HER

09:48.055 --> 09:57.597
IF I LEAVE NOMINATIONS THE SAME
AND WE GET REDID -- GET RID OF

09:57.631 --> 09:58.465
KEVIN.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.000
>> GIVE US ALL OF YOUR
DECISIONS, JOSH.

10:00.033 --> 10:08.508
>> I CHOOSE NOT TO YOU THE POWER
OF VETO.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.711
>> I WANT KEVIN OUT.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.780
I WANT KEVIN OUT.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.248
I DIDN'T USE IT.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.318
I WANT KEVIN OUT.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.853
>> OKAY.

10:19.887 --> 10:20.854
ARE YOU SURE?

10:20.888 --> 10:21.655
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:21.689 --> 10:22.555
>> ABSOLUTELY.

10:22.589 --> 10:27.060
NONE OF US WILL WIN AGAINST HIM.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.862
>> COME ON, DUET.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.497
WHEN HAS KEVIN WON ANYTHING?

10:30.530 --> 10:33.300
WE KNOW RAVEN IS A BIGGER
THREAT.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.968
SHE'S CLEARLY THE BIGGER
COMPETITOR.

10:35.002 --> 10:38.338
AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE BETTER COMPETITOR.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.241
>> IT'S TO YOU.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.442
IT'S IN YOUR HANDS.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.044
I VOICED MY CONCERN.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.079
>> I MADE MY CONTENTIONS CLEAR.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.349
I HAVE BLOOD ON MY HANDS FOR
JASON'S EVICTION.

10:49.382 --> 10:54.154
SO IF THEY WANT TO GET RAVEN
OUT, THEY CAN GET THE BLOOD ON

10:54.187 --> 11:06.499
THEIR HANDS AND TAKE THE SHOT.

11:06.533 --> 11:10.637
>> PAUL AND CHRISTMAS WANT THIS
VOTE TO BE UNANIMOUS TO TAKE

11:10.670 --> 11:11.739
RAVEN OUT.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.775
LAST TIME PAUL SPLIT THE VOTE
FOR THE JASON EVICTION.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.675
HE LOOKED GOOD.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.576
HIS HANDS WERE CLEAN.

11:16.609 --> 11:17.811
GUESS WHAT?

11:17.845 --> 11:21.581
I WANT TO SPLIT THE VOTE FOR
RAVEN'S EVICTION AND I WANT TO

11:21.614 --> 11:22.182
LOOK PRETTY.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.884
>> PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTE.

11:23.917 --> 11:29.823
>> I VOTE TO EVICT RAVEN.

11:29.857 --> 11:36.696
>> I GOT TO VOTE TO EVICT RAVEN.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.932
>> I VOTE TO EVICT KEVIN.

11:38.966 --> 11:45.873
>> BY A VOTE OF 2-1, RAVEN, YOU
ARE EVICTED FROM THE "BIG

11:45.906 --> 11:47.340
BROTHER" HOUSE.

11:47.374 --> 11:53.246
>> OKAY.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.215
>> I'M SORRY, RAVE.

11:55.248 --> 11:59.719
I'M SO SORRY, RAVEN.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.155
I'M SO SORRY, RAVEN.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.024
>> I THOUGHT YOU HAD MY BACK.

12:04.057 --> 12:04.657
YOU DIDN'T.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.795
>> I'M SO SORRY, RAVEN.

12:07.828 --> 12:18.738
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.708
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE BLOCK
ALL SEASON.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.675
79 DAYS.

12:22.709 --> 12:28.415
THE LAST 40 MINUTES, I'VE BEEN
ON THE BLOCK.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.316
I'M VERY HAPPY.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.584
I'M NOT SMILING, BUT I'M HAPPY.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.186
>> BOTH TIMES'S BEEN BLINDSIDED.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.489
I THOUGHT KEVIN WAS GOING HOME
FOR SURE.

12:36.523 --> 12:41.761
NOT ONLY AM I DEVASTATED ABOUT
LOSING JASON, NOW I'M WORRIED

12:41.795 --> 12:47.901
THAT I MIGHT BE NEXT.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.502
>> AND THEN THERE WAS FIVE.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.337
WHAT THE HELL?

12:50.370 --> 12:51.338
WHAT THE HELL?

12:51.371 --> 12:54.141
I DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD DO A
DOUBLE EVICTION.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.656
>> I JUST LOST THIS GAME.

13:09.689 --> 13:16.563
>> I TRY TO THROW A VOTE TO KEEP
RAVEN BUT PAUL AND CHRISTMAS MAY

13:16.596 --> 13:17.530
THINK I WENT ROGUE.

13:17.564 --> 13:25.472
I JUST MIGHT HAVE PLAYED MYSELF.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.507
>> HERE, JOSH.

14:15.989 --> 14:21.461
>> AFTER BEING BLINDSIDED TWICE,
I NEED AS MANY ALLIES AS I CAN

14:21.494 --> 14:22.629
GET.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.232
EVEN THOUGH JOSH SENT HOME
JASON, HE DIDN'T USE THE VETO.

14:25.265 --> 14:29.602
SO IF JOSH IS EXTENDING AN OLIVE
BRANCH, I SHOULD GRAB TO WHAT I

14:29.636 --> 14:32.472
CAN TAKE.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE CHRISTMAS

14:32.505 --> 14:34.507
IS AT.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.109
I DON'T KNOW.

14:52.125 --> 14:58.932
>> THANK YOU FOR NOT USING THE
VETO.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.468
THE SAME REASON YOU HAD, BRO.

15:01.501 --> 15:08.841
SHE FISH-TAILED ME IN EVERY
COMPETITION.

15:08.875 --> 15:09.876
>> OKAY.

15:27.827 --> 15:32.265
>> THIS KID GOES FROM CRYING,
I'M THINKING HIS EMOTIONAL TO

15:32.299 --> 15:33.466
INSTANTLY SMILING.

15:33.500 --> 15:39.072
HE'S HAPPY THAT THE PLAN WORKED
EXACTLY HOW HE WANTED IT TO

15:39.106 --> 15:39.939
WORK.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.408
I THOUGHT I SAW THE DEVIL OR
SOMETHING.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.126
>> I HONESTLY LOVE BOTH OF YOU.

15:59.159 --> 16:06.066
I ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY A
STRAIGHT GAME BECAUSE I TRUSTED

16:06.099 --> 16:07.134
ALL OF YOU.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.337
I MEAN, IT'S A GAME.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.138
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.806
BUT LIKE I THOUGHT WE WERE
FRIENDS.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.708
THAT'S WHY IT HURTS THE MOST.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.944
>> JASON WENT HOME.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.845
RAVEN WENT HOME.

16:18.878 --> 16:24.851
AND SOMEHOW KEVIN SURVIVED BOTH
EVICTIONS.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.188
I'VE GOT TO BE IN THE TWILIGHT
ZONE.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.456
I HAD CONTROL OF THIS GAME.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.559
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I STAND.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.694
I HAVE TO RE-AFFIRM MY
RELATIONSHIPS.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.597
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.468
>> I LITERALLY HAVE -- I LOVE
EVERY ONE OF YOU.

16:41.501 --> 16:45.338
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HARD TO HAVE
TO GO AGAINST EACH OTHER.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.374
>> LET ME JUMP IN.

16:47.407 --> 16:51.178
JASON, AT THIS POINT, HE'S JUST
A GREAT COMPETITOR.

16:51.211 --> 16:55.048
HE CAN RUN CIRCLES AROUND ALL OF
US.

16:55.082 --> 16:59.519
THAT MADE ME VERY SCARED.

16:59.552 --> 17:03.056
>> IT HURT ME.
>> IT BREAKS MY HEART.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.225
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WALKED OUT
LIKE THAT.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.193
>> IT'S A GAME, JOSH.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.862
HE WILL GET OVER IT THE SECOND
HE WALKS OUT.

17:09.896 --> 17:10.930
IT'S A GAME.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.599
LET'S TAKE THE PERSONAL OUT OF
IT.

17:12.632 --> 17:17.470
YOU MADE IT TO THE FINAL FIVE.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.039
BUT WE HAVE A COMPETITION.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.308
WE NEED TO PLAY IT.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.877
>> SO AT THIS POINT, ALEX IS MY
BIGGEST COMPETITION AND THREAT

17:24.911 --> 17:27.013
AND I HAVE TO GET HER OUT.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.750
SO I NEED JOSH TO WIN THE NEXT
HOH TO TAKE A SHOT AT ALEX.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.553
IN ORDER FOR HIM TO DO THAT, I
HAVE TO CONVINCE KEVIN TO THROW

17:33.586 --> 17:35.522
THE COMPETITION.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.124
>> DO NOT WIN THE NEXT HOH.

17:37.157 --> 17:40.026
>> WHO IS WINNING IT?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.728
>> WE'RE GIVING TO IT CHRISTMAS.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.197
>> IS SHE GOING TO PUT ME UP
AGAIN?

17:44.231 --> 17:46.133
>> WE MIGHT HAVE TO BUT WE'RE
GIVING TO IT CHRISTMAS.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.300
DON'T WORRY.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.470
>> I NEED TO TELL KEVIN WE'RE
THROWING THE COMPETITION TO

17:50.503 --> 17:52.372
CHRISTMAS EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT
TRUE.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.675
BECAUSE KEVIN IN NO WAY IS GOING
TO THROW IT TO JOSH.

17:55.708 --> 18:00.780
>> I WANT TO WIN THE HOH, BUT I
TRUST PAUL.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.216
HE'S GIVEN ME HIS WORD WHICH IS
SOLID AS A ROCK.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.251
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.518
>> IT'S A DONE DEAL.

18:05.552 --> 18:10.857
>> NOW I HAVE KEVIN ON BOARD TO
THROW IT, I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO

18:10.890 --> 18:12.091
JOSH.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.462
I NEED TO MAKE SURE HE'S WILLING
TO TAKE THE SHOT AT ALEX AND

18:15.495 --> 18:21.968
THEN I GET ANOTHER TARGET OUT
WITH NO BLOOD ON MY HANDS.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.002
>> WE MADE IT.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.661
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T
TAKE THAT SHOT AT ALEX?

18:48.695 --> 18:51.864
WHAT OTHER SHOT IS THERE TO
TAKE?

18:51.898 --> 18:53.633
JOSH, I'VE SET THE PLAN IN
PLACE.

18:53.666 --> 18:58.037
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PLAY YOUR
PART, WIN HOH AND TARGET ALEX.

18:58.070 --> 19:05.745
>> I WAS TRYING TO MAKE HER TO
FEEL BAD.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.547
DON'T BUY IN.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.583
YOU SIGNED UP FOR BIG BROTHER.

19:10.617 --> 19:15.555
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.491
I HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU SOMETHING
WRONG IN THE GAME.

19:18.525 --> 19:23.496
SO DON'T BACK OUT ON ME NOW,
HOMEY.

19:23.530 --> 19:28.335
>> SO PAUL HAS THIS PLAN AND
IT'S GENIUS BUT ONLY PROTECTS

19:28.368 --> 19:29.969
PAUL'S GAME AND EXPOSES MINE.

19:30.002 --> 19:40.046
IF I WIN THIS HOH, I'M GOING TO
DO THINGS MY WAY.

19:40.046 --> 19:50.056
IF I WIN THIS HOH, I'M GOING TO
DO THINGS MY WAY.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.101
>> HOW ARE YOU?

20:02.134 --> 20:02.835
>> I'M OKAY.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.437
>> NOBODY IS OKAY.

20:04.471 --> 20:11.077
SOMETIMES THE CONVERSATIONS ARE
DOING HIS PART MAKES ME FEEL

20:11.110 --> 20:15.582
LIKE YOU'RE PLAYING SEEDS OF
DOUBT ABOUT HOW HE'S PLAYING HIS

20:15.615 --> 20:17.250
GAME.
>> CHRISTMAS IS MY NUMBER 1.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.185
GUY TO HER WITH EVERYTHING.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.921
LATELY I'VE BEEN GOING TO HER
ABOUT PAUL'S GAME.

20:21.954 --> 20:25.492
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR ME OUT.

20:25.525 --> 20:31.731
IN A WAY SHE'S DEFENDING PAUL
AND PROTECTING PAUL.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.434
I DON'T GET IT.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.803
I REALLY DON'T.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.938
>> NEVER TURN AGAINST THEM.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.941
NEVER TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.976
>> NEVER.

20:51.418 --> 20:58.391
>> WHY ARE WE THE BEST TEAM EVER
IN THE WORLD?

20:58.425 --> 21:08.234
THIS IS A PIVOTAL POINT IN THE
GAME THAT HE CANNOT MESS UP.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.102
>> I WAS TERRIFIED.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.405
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BLOW
IT UP.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.840
>> I'M FREAKED OUT ABOUT JOSH.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.643
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO
DO.

21:16.676 --> 21:21.681
HE WENT ROGUE ON THE RAVEN VOTE
THAT SHOWS ME HE'S GOING TO DO

21:21.714 --> 21:22.882
HIS OWN THING.

21:22.915 --> 21:23.650
IT SCARED ME.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.619
>> NO MORE BABY JOSH.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.656
WE NEED TO PUT HIM --
>> IT'S NOT OKAY.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.134
>> HEY, EVERYONE.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.970
IT'S TIME FOR THE HOH
COMPETITION.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.305
COME GATHER IN THE LIVING ROOM.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.174
>> THIS IS AMAZING.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.909
YOU LOOK HOT.

21:49.942 --> 21:54.381
WELCOME TO B.B. COMICS WEEK.

21:54.414 --> 22:00.186
OH!

PEOPLE TALKING.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.023
HERE'S SOME POPULAR ONES IN THE
PAST.

22:04.056 --> 22:09.696
>> OH, MY GOD, NICOLE!
>> B.B. COMICS ARE SUPER HERO

22:09.729 --> 22:11.364
VERSIONS OF EACH HOUSE GUEST.

22:11.398 --> 22:14.501
>> OH, MY GOSH!
>> I LITERALLY HAVE BEEN WAITING

22:14.534 --> 22:15.568
ALL SEASON FOR THIS.

22:15.602 --> 22:21.207
THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST "BIG
BROTHER" MOMENTS.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.242
>> WE HAVE THE CRY BABY.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.076
LISTEN.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.814
WE KNOW WHO IS THE BIGGEST CRY
BABY.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.515
HUH?

22:28.548 --> 22:34.454
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK!
>> WHAT?

22:34.487 --> 22:41.828
>> OH, MY GOD!
>> YOU KNOW, SUPER HERO MOVIES

22:41.861 --> 22:43.029
HAVE RULED THE BOX OFFICE.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.497
NOW "BIG BROTHER" IS GETTING IN
ON THE ACTION.

22:44.531 --> 22:48.535
THE LAST FEW YEARS, B.B. COMICS
HAS TAKEN THE COMIC BOOK WORLD

22:48.568 --> 22:49.135
BY STORM.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.336
YOU KNEW IT WAS COMING.

22:50.369 --> 22:57.209
THE FIRST FILM IN THE B.B.
COMICS UNIVERSE "THE REVENGERS"

22:57.243 --> 22:58.845
IS ON ITS WAY.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.047
HERE'S A EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK AT
THE TRAILER THAT EVERYBODY WILL

23:01.080 --> 23:03.583
BE TALKING ABOUT.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.551
>> WHAT?

23:04.584 --> 23:13.225
>> YEAH!
>> DON'T MAKE ME ASK YOU TWICE.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.796
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:16.829 --> 23:28.340
>> YOU'RE MY HERO.

23:28.374 --> 23:34.847
>> A NEW THREAT HAS COME TO THE
CITY.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.383
WE DON'T KNOW WHO OR HAD WITH IT
IS.

23:37.416 --> 23:43.556
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT SUPER HEROS
ARE GETTING WHACKED.

23:43.590 --> 23:47.226
TURNED INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

23:47.259 --> 23:52.565
>> YOU THINK SOMEBODY IS
CREATING AN ARMY?

23:52.599 --> 23:55.267
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M
SAYING.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.536
>> SORRY.

23:56.569 --> 24:01.173
WE STOPPED BELIEVING PEOPLE WITH
SAUSAGES FOR HANDS A LONG TIME

24:01.207 --> 24:02.942
AGO.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.745
>> GUYS, WE WERE IN AN ALLIANCE.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.946
>> YEAH, WERE.

24:06.979 --> 24:12.719
>> THE ONLY WAY THEY SURVIVE IS
IF THEY WORK TOGETHER.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.354
>> IT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.288
>> JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN.

24:16.322 --> 24:22.629
>> IF YOU WON'T DO IT FOR ME, DO
IT FOR HELP.

24:22.662 --> 24:27.066
DOESN'T HE DESERVE REVENGE?

24:27.099 --> 24:33.139
>> SO I SEE YOU BROUGHT SOME
FRIENDS.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.174
SO DID I.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.375
>> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

24:36.408 --> 24:39.912
>> I'M THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.448
YOU'RE DEAD.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.083
>> NO.

24:44.116 --> 24:54.160
WE'RE THE REVENGERS!
>> GLITTER BALL!

24:54.160 --> 25:04.236
WE'RE THE REVENGERS!
>> GLITTER BALL!

25:11.377 --> 25:16.148
LOOKS LIKE THE REVENGERS ARE ALL
OUT OF TRICKS.

25:16.182 --> 25:29.061
>> ACTUALLY --
>> NO, NOT BIG MEECH!

25:29.095 --> 25:32.932
>> YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH OCTOBER
FISTS, AREN'T YOU?

25:32.965 --> 25:34.533
FOR SUPER SAFETY GIRL?

25:34.567 --> 25:40.439
>> I'M PRETTY CLOSE TO BOTH,
ACTUALLY.

25:40.472 --> 25:43.509
>> OH, MY GOSH!
>> THIS IS EPIC!

25:43.542 --> 25:47.914
>> THIS TRAILER, THE REVENGERS,
IS AWESOME.

25:47.947 --> 25:53.820
THEY EVEN HAD DAN FROM SEASON 10
AND SEASON 14 AS THE FUNERAL

25:53.853 --> 25:54.754
DIRECTOR.

25:54.787 --> 25:55.988
THE GUY IS THE BIG "BIG BROTHER"
PLAYER EVER.

25:56.022 --> 26:02.595
>> IT'S TIME TO GET OUR B.B.
COMIC GEAR AND HEAD TO THE BACK

26:02.629 --> 26:12.238
YARD!
>> YEAH!

26:12.271 --> 26:14.674
>> THIS IS AWESOME!
>> OH, MAN!

26:14.707 --> 26:16.308
>> GOING TO THE BACK YARD.

26:16.342 --> 26:24.050
>> FEELING LIKE I'M LITERALLY
JUMPING INTO B.B. COMICS.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.152
BOW, WHAM!
I'M SO EXCITED.

26:26.185 --> 26:29.121
>> ONCE AGAIN, THE POWER IS UP
FOR GRABS.

26:29.155 --> 26:34.160
JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD,
YOU CAUGHT REVENGER FEVER.

26:34.193 --> 26:39.065
I HOPE YOU HAVE OBSESSED EVERY
DETAIL OF THE TRAILER.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.068
BECAUSE THE BIGGEST FAN WILL
BECOME THE NEXT HEAD OF

26:42.101 --> 26:42.568
HOUSEHOLD.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.836
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

26:43.870 --> 26:47.306
I'LL ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE
REVENGERS TRAILER.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.877
ANSWER BY PLACING ONE OF THE
CHARACTERS AT THE FRONT OF YOUR

26:50.910 --> 26:51.778
ROOM.

26:51.811 --> 26:52.979
IF YOU'RE CORRECT, YOU'LL
RECEIVE A POINT.

26:53.012 --> 26:56.983
THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST POINTS
WILL BECOME THE NEW HEAD OF

26:57.016 --> 26:57.817
HOUSEHOLD.

26:57.850 --> 27:02.454
WHO IS READY TO PLAY "THE
REVENGERS?"

27:02.488 --> 27:08.060
>> GOING INTO THIS COMP, A, I
WANT TO THROW IT, AND B I WANT

27:08.094 --> 27:10.062
KRISTIN AND KEVIN TO THROW IT.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.563
I WANT JOSH TO WIN IT.

27:11.597 --> 27:15.968
IF HE WINS IT, I WON'T TOUCH THE
BLOCK AND HE WILL DO EXACTLY

27:16.002 --> 27:17.036
WHAT I TELL HIM.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.972
>> GOING INTO THE HOH, WE HAVE A
PLAN IN MOTION.

27:20.006 --> 27:23.075
EVERYBODY IS THROWING IT TO ME.

27:23.109 --> 27:26.679
I'LL GOING TO TAKE THE SHOT THIS
WEEK.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.048
BUT THEY DO KNOW WHICH WAY I'M
AIMING.

27:29.081 --> 27:35.354
>> VOTING THE COMPETITION, I'M
THINKING MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME

27:35.387 --> 27:38.257
TO WIN.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.158
IT'S MY TURN NOW.

27:39.191 --> 27:46.432
>> WHO SAID "WE'RE THE
REVENGERS?"

27:46.465 --> 27:48.534
I KNOW THIS ONE.

27:48.567 --> 27:53.740
IT'S FRANKIE THE FLAMINGO.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.574
I'M GOING TO LOCK IN MY ANSWER.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.243
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST TO
THIS POINT.

27:57.276 --> 28:01.513
ALL I KNOW IS I TRIED TO SEND
KEVIN HOME TWICE.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.549
HE CAN'T WIN IT.

28:03.582 --> 28:06.986
I KNOW HE'S COMING FOR ME NEXT.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.054
>> ALL RIGHT.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.256
LET'S SEE WHO THE ANSWER WAS.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.457
>> NO.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.893
WE'RE THE REVENGERS.

28:13.926 --> 28:17.096
>> THE CORRECT IS THE FLAMINGO.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.699
THAT MEAN A JOSH, CHRISTMAS AND
KEVIN ALL GET A POINT.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.968
>> DAMN.

28:22.001 --> 28:24.303
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
KEVIN BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU

28:24.336 --> 28:28.140
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT HERE
AND ASSUME THAT YOU JUST WANTED

28:28.174 --> 28:30.810
TO GET ONE RIGHT AND BOMB THE
REST.

28:30.843 --> 28:31.744
>> QUESTION NUMBER 2.

28:31.778 --> 28:39.185
WHO APPEARED ON THE SCHOOL IS
COOL POSTERS.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.588
>> THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I
ASKED, WHO WAS ON THE SCHOOL

28:42.621 --> 28:44.490
POSTERS WAS THE LITTLE GUY ON
THE LEFT THERE.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.093
CAMO IS HIS NAME.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.261
I PUT HIM UP.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.662
>> LET'S SEE WHO IT WAS.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.564
>> IF YOU WANT DO IT FOR ME.

28:52.598 --> 28:57.169
>> IF YOU DON'T DO IT FOR ME, DO
IT FOR HIM.

28:57.203 --> 29:00.306
>> IT WAS COLONEL CAMO.

29:00.339 --> 29:04.743
EVERYBODY GOT IT RIGHT!
>> ALL RIGHT, KEVIN.

29:04.777 --> 29:07.780
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON ME.

29:07.814 --> 29:10.116
FOOL ME TWICE WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING?

29:10.149 --> 29:10.649
THAT'S IT.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.051
I'M PLAYING THIS COMP.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.185
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:13.219 --> 29:16.055
>> I THINK I CAN WIN THIS BUT I
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEST.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.256
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

29:17.289 --> 29:22.261
>> CURRENTLY WE HAVE A THREE-WAY
TIE BETWEEN JOSH, KEVIN AND

29:22.294 --> 29:24.696
CHRISTMAS WITH TWO POINTS.

29:24.730 --> 29:28.835
PAUL IS ONE POINT BEHIND.

29:28.868 --> 29:29.535
QUESTION NUMBER 3.

29:29.568 --> 29:35.641
WHO ASKED WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

29:35.674 --> 29:39.145
>> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU CAN ONLY
BE MOMMA DAY.

29:39.178 --> 29:44.150
I'M FEELING CONFIDENT I KNOW I'M
GOING TO GET THIS ANSWER RIGHT.

29:44.183 --> 29:48.187
EVEN THOUGH I THROW IT, I NEED
TO BACK UP JOSH 100% AND MAKE

29:48.220 --> 29:52.191
SURE KEVIN DOESN'T WIN IT.

29:52.224 --> 29:56.929
>> LET'S SEE WHO THE ANSWER IS.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.464
>> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

29:58.497 --> 30:03.735
>> THE ANSWER IS MOMMA DAY.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.671
EVERYONE GETS A POINT EXCEPT FOR
KEVIN.

30:05.704 --> 30:06.772
>> GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.374
>> THERE YOU GO, KEVIN.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.576
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

30:10.609 --> 30:11.643
HERE'S A SNACK.

30:11.677 --> 30:12.879
KEEP GETTING THEM WRONG.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.146
>> QUESTION NUMBER 4.

30:14.180 --> 30:20.652
WHO IS THE SECOND TO BE HIT BY
ONE OF BIG MEECH'S GIANT TEARS?

30:20.686 --> 30:23.822
>> KEVIN HAVE TWO.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.624
JOSH AND CHRISTMAS HAVE THREE.

30:25.657 --> 30:32.098
I HAVE TO GET THIS SO I CAN
CONTROL WHO WINS AND WHO LOSES.

30:32.131 --> 30:32.999
ROUND FOUR.

30:33.032 --> 30:43.075
WHO WAS GETTING HIT BY BIG
MEECH'S TEARS?

30:43.109 --> 30:46.745
OBVIOUSLY MR. SPECTACULAR.
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE

30:46.778 --> 30:49.315
ANSWER.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.718
>> NOT BIG MEECH.

30:52.751 --> 30:55.854
>> THE ANSWER WAS,
MR. SPECTACULAR.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.857
SO PAUL IS THE ONLY ONE THAT
GETS IT RIGHT.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.026
ALL RIGHT.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.861
WE HAVE A THREE-WAY TIE BETWEEN
PAUL, CHRISTMAS AND JOSH.

31:02.895 --> 31:07.833
EACH WITH THREE POINTS AND KEVIN
CLOSE BEHIND WITH TWO.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.969
QUESTION NUMBER 5.

31:10.002 --> 31:13.906
WHO WAS FIRST TO USE THE WORD
"FRIENDS."

31:13.940 --> 31:17.109
>> WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO
MENTION "FRIENDS."

31:17.143 --> 31:19.178
I HAVE NO IDEA.

31:19.211 --> 31:26.018
I'M GOING TO TAKE A WILD GUESS
AND PICK NICOLE.

31:26.052 --> 31:26.718
>> ALL RIGHT.

31:26.752 --> 31:32.791
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE ANSWER.

31:32.824 --> 31:36.728
>> I SEE YOU BROUGHT SOME
FRIENDS.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.830
>> IT WAS THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

31:38.864 --> 31:44.736
KEVIN WAS THE ONLY ONE TO GET IT
RIGHT.

31:44.770 --> 31:48.040
>> I WANT TO SEE PICTURES OF MY
FAMILY.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.309
I WANT A LETTER OF MY FAMILY.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.344
EVERYBODY READ A COUPLE LETTERS.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.279
I HAVEN'T READ ANY.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.981
>> WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?

31:55.014 --> 31:58.750
WHEN I NEED JOSH AND CHRISTMAS
TO GET IT RIGHT, THEY GET IT

31:58.784 --> 31:59.918
WRONG.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.853
IF KEVIN GETS ANOTHER DAMN
QUESTION RIGHT, HE'S GOING TO

32:01.887 --> 32:05.524
SCREW UP MY PLAN AND THE
REVENGERS WON'T SAVE HIM.

32:05.557 --> 32:09.761
I'LL BE PISSED.

32:09.795 --> 32:10.262
f

32:10.296 --> 32:11.263
TIE FOR FIRST PLACE.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.464
IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.907
>> CURRENTLY WE HAVE A FOUR-WAY
TIE FOR FIRST PLACE.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.910
IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME WITH TWO
MORE QUESTIONS LEFT.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.414
GOING TO ROUND SIX, IT'S A
FOUR-WAY TIE.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.881
COULD THIS NIGHT GET ANY WORSE?

32:29.915 --> 32:32.218
IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME AT THIS
POINT.

32:32.251 --> 32:36.822
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE ANYBODY'S
GAME.

32:36.855 --> 32:40.259
IF KEVIN WINS, I'LL BE ON THE
BLOCK.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.162
>> KEVIN HASN'T WON A
COMPETITION ALL SEASON LONG.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.665
I THROW ONE VOTE HIS WAY AND NOW
HE'S GUNNING FOR HOH.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.599
HE'S FIRED UP.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.569
SO NOW I NEED TO LOCK IT DOWN.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.805
PUT ON MY GAME FACE AND GET
THESE QUESTIONS RIGHT.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.841
>> TIME FOR QUESTION 6.

32:55.874 --> 33:03.215
WHO WAS FIRST TO USE THE WORD
"REVENGE."

33:03.249 --> 33:04.850
>> I KNOW THESE QUESTIONS.

33:04.883 --> 33:09.088
I REMEMBER THE LITTLE GIRL, OF
COURSE, NICOLE.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.357
BUT I TRUST PAUL.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.625
HE HAS ALWAYS GIVEN ME HIS WORD.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.461
HE'S AS SOLID AS A ROCK.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.997
I'M GOING TO STICK WITH HIM.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.199
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

33:20.232 --> 33:20.899
>> ALL RIGHT.

33:20.932 --> 33:28.040
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE ANSWER.

33:28.074 --> 33:31.710
>> DOESN'T HE DESERVE REVENGE?

33:31.743 --> 33:34.380
>> IT WAS OCTOBERFIST.

33:34.413 --> 33:39.451
JOSH IS THE ONLY PERSON TO GET
IT RIGHT.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.153
THAT MEANS JOSH TAKES THE LEAD.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.822
>> BOOM!
THE ONLY ONE TO GET THE ANSWERS

33:43.855 --> 33:48.026
RIGHT AND I'M INSTANTLY IN FIRST
PLACE.

33:48.060 --> 33:53.432
I'M A HUGE "BIG BROTHER" FAN BUT
WHO KNEW I WOULD BE A BIG FAN OF

33:53.465 --> 33:54.600
THE REVENGERS?

33:54.633 --> 33:57.269
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY JOSH IS
LEADING.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.937
CHRISTMAS SHOULD BE UP TWO OR
THREE ANSWERS.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.139
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
DOING.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.006
I DON'T.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.309
>> JOSH IS IN THE LEAD WITH FOUR
POINTS.

34:03.342 --> 34:08.046
AND PAUL, KEVIN AND CHRISTMAS
CLOSE BEHIND WITH THREE POINTS

34:08.080 --> 34:08.947
EACH.

34:08.980 --> 34:12.451
FINAL QUESTION.

34:12.484 --> 34:16.855
WHO SPOKE THE LAST WORD BEFORE
THE FIRST PERSON WAS HIT BY ONE

34:16.888 --> 34:20.792
OF BIG MEECH'S GIANT TEARS?

34:20.826 --> 34:21.993
>> WE'RE IN THE LAST ROUND.

34:22.027 --> 34:25.231
JOSH HAS A ONE-POINT LEAD.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.899
ALL I'M HOPING FOR IS EVERYBODY
GETS IT WRONG.

34:27.933 --> 34:33.539
IF KEVIN TIES IT UP AND WINS THE
WHOLE PLAN IS RUINED.

34:33.572 --> 34:37.443
>> WHO SPOKE THE LAST WORD
BEFORE THE -- I DON'T EVEN

34:37.476 --> 34:38.710
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.846
I'M JUST HOPING THAT EVERYBODY
ELSE GETS THE QUESTION WRONG AND

34:40.879 --> 34:48.320
I WIN THIS HOH BECAUSE I NEED IT
REAL BAD.

34:48.354 --> 34:49.921
>> ALL RIGHT.

34:49.955 --> 34:50.956
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

34:50.989 --> 34:55.561
>> LOOKS LIKE THE REVENGERS ARE
ALL OUT OF TRICKS.

34:55.594 --> 35:04.035
>> ACTUALLY --
>> THE ANSWER WAS THE FLAMINGO.

35:04.069 --> 35:06.372
EVERYONE GOT IT WRONG.

35:06.405 --> 35:12.978
SO JOSH, YOU'RE THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD!

35:13.011 --> 35:20.752
>> YES!
>> GUYS, I MADE IT TO THE FINAL

35:20.786 --> 35:21.153
FOUR.

35:21.187 --> 35:21.720
IT'S AWESOME.

35:21.753 --> 35:22.288
TOP FOUR.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.156
I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.157
I'M LOVING LIFE.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.859
>> CONGRATS, PAL.

35:27.893 --> 35:28.660
>> THANK YOU.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.496
>> GOOD WORK.

35:30.529 --> 35:31.597
>> GOOD JOB.

35:31.630 --> 35:36.702
>> FOR THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW
NOW, I PULLED OFF THE

35:36.735 --> 35:37.336
IMPOSSIBLE.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.371
JOSH WINS A MENTAL COMP.

35:39.405 --> 35:42.274
I DON'T KNOW HOW I PULLED THIS
OFF.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.744
BUT I PULLED THIS OFF.

35:45.777 --> 35:49.215
>> JOSH WINS IT AND I'M WORRIED
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE I

35:49.248 --> 35:50.182
STAND.

35:50.216 --> 35:51.883
I NEED TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT A
THREAT TO JOSH.

35:51.917 --> 35:55.053
I HAVE TO REMAIN CALM AND PLAY
IT OFF LIKE I DON'T CARE SO I'M

35:55.086 --> 35:56.288
NOT A TARGET.

35:56.322 --> 36:00.526
>> IF I KNEW JOSH WAS GOING TO
WIN, I WOULD HAVE NEVER GOT

36:00.559 --> 36:02.561
NOTHING WRONG.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.230
I'M EMBARRASSED.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.665
THE PLAN WASN'T HIM TO WIN.

36:06.698 --> 36:10.269
NOW HE MAKES IT TO THE FOURTH
PLACE AUTOMATIC?

36:10.302 --> 36:15.841
>> I GOT ANOTHER LETTER!

36:27.253 --> 36:30.356
>> SUPER STRENGTHS.

36:30.389 --> 36:34.092
>> JOSH IS HOH AND I'M FEELING A
LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

36:34.125 --> 36:39.731
HE WORKS ON EMOTION, WHICH IS
HORRIBLE IN THIS GAME.

36:39.765 --> 36:45.103
IF HE SENSES I'M ANGRY AT HIM,
HE COULD PUT ME ON THE BLOCK.

36:45.136 --> 36:49.241
>> YOU NEED TO GET THAT CAPE OFF
AND LET IT SHINE.

36:49.275 --> 36:51.877
>> PAUL HAS MANAGED TO GET
PEOPLE TO THROW COMPETITIONS

36:51.910 --> 36:53.111
ABOUT SIX TIMES ALREADY.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.446
IT BIZARRE TO ME.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.583
IT'S LIKE A MASTERMIND TURNING
INTO A MONSTER.

36:57.616 --> 37:02.220
I KNOW THAT CHRISTMAS AND PAUL
WANT ME TO TAKE A SHOT AT ALEX.

37:02.254 --> 37:13.865
THIS COULD BE MY ONLY CHANCE TO
TAKE A SHOT AT PAUL.

37:13.899 --> 37:23.041
>> DO I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING OR
DO I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING?

37:23.074 --> 37:25.377
>> YOU'RE PUTTING ME THROUGH
HELL.

37:25.411 --> 37:28.380
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY.

37:28.414 --> 37:38.457
>> RELAX.

37:38.457 --> 37:44.963
>> RELAX.

37:51.937 --> 37:56.508
>> YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, RIGHT,
HOMEY?

37:56.542 --> 37:58.209
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

37:58.243 --> 38:00.145
>> PAUL CHECKS IN WITH ME.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.781
HE GOES YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO, RIGHT?

38:02.814 --> 38:05.817
IT'S LIKE DO I REALLY HAVE OTHER
OPTIONS?

38:05.851 --> 38:06.785
YOU'RE MY ALLY.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.520
CHRISTMAS IS MY ALLY.

38:08.554 --> 38:11.757
WE HAVE A MUTUAL TARGET, WHICH
IS ALEX BECAUSE SHE'S A BEAST.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.093
SO WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME RIGHT
NOW?

38:15.126 --> 38:18.530
I DON'T NEED SOMEBODY TELLING ME
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO I MIGHT

38:18.564 --> 38:22.668
HAVE TO SIT BACK, REEVALUATE THE
SITUATION AND ASK MYSELF IS THIS

38:22.701 --> 38:32.744
THE RIGHT MOVE OR SHOULD I MAKE
A BIGGER MOVE?

38:32.744 --> 38:38.517
THE RIGHT MOVE OR SHOULD I MAKE
A BIGGER MOVE?

38:38.550 --> 38:42.688
.
>> GUYS, I LOVE PAUL.

38:42.721 --> 38:46.725
BUT I GOT TO SEPARATE PERSONAL
AND I GOT TO PLAY THE GAME.

38:46.758 --> 38:51.162
PAUL HAS PLAYED THE BEST GAME
THIS SEASON.

38:51.196 --> 38:54.866
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD TAKE A
SHOT NOW OR IF I WAIT TILL TOP

38:54.900 --> 38:56.868
THREE AND THEN TAKE A SHOT.

38:56.902 --> 39:01.239
MY HOPE IS I'M NOT ONLY THINKING
ABOUT MY GAME, I'M THINKING

39:01.272 --> 39:02.541
ABOUT CHRISTMAS' GAME.

39:02.574 --> 39:06.412
I DO MAKE A CRAZY MOVE THIS
WEEK, HOW IS IT GOING TO TURN

39:06.445 --> 39:07.112
CHRISTMAS AGAINST ME?

39:07.145 --> 39:15.120
WHAT IF I SLIP UP IN THE END?

39:15.153 --> 39:19.591
I KNOW WITH PAUL, WE'LL GO TO
FINAL THREE.

39:19.625 --> 39:24.029
AND THEN I CAN'T BEAT PAUL IN
THE END, EVEN HIM BEING A VET.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.964
EVERYBODY IS MAT AT ME.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.767
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO VOTE FOR
PAUL.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.839

HIM IN AND RETALIATE FOR SENDING

41:50.141 --> 41:51.109
JASON HOME.
