01:22.500 --> 01:24.835
Do you find me sadistic?

01:31.342 --> 01:38.308
You know, I'll bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

01:38.391 --> 01:40.393
If I wanted to.

01:42.270 --> 01:45.607
You know, kiddo...

01:46.358 --> 01:52.531
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

01:52.614 --> 01:58.578
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

02:00.038 --> 02:04.042
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.

02:06.503 --> 02:08.463
But not you.

02:11.509 --> 02:13.052
No, kiddo.

02:13.136 --> 02:14.929
At this moment...

02:17.306 --> 02:23.646
This is me at my most
masochistic.

02:23.729 --> 02:27.775
Bill, it's your baby.

02:42.165 --> 02:44.333
# I was 5 and he was 6 #

02:44.417 --> 02:48.213
# We rode on horses
made of sticks #

02:48.297 --> 02:51.967
# He wore black
and I wore white #

02:52.050 --> 02:53.886
# He would always win
the fight #

02:53.969 --> 02:55.137
# Bang bang #

02:55.220 --> 02:56.555
# He shot me down #

02:56.638 --> 02:57.890
# Bang bang #

02:57.973 --> 03:00.184
# I hit the ground #

03:00.267 --> 03:02.102
# Bang bang #

03:02.186 --> 03:04.646
# That awful sound #

03:04.730 --> 03:06.565
# Bang bang #

03:06.648 --> 03:11.236
# My baby shot me down #

03:19.411 --> 03:23.041
# Seasons came and changed
the time #

03:23.124 --> 03:27.545
# When I grew up,
I called him mine #

03:27.629 --> 03:29.631
# He would always laugh
and say #

03:29.714 --> 03:32.800
# "Remember when
we used to play?" #

03:32.884 --> 03:35.261
# Bang bang #

03:35.345 --> 03:36.554
# I shot you down #

03:36.638 --> 03:38.473
# Bang bang #

03:38.556 --> 03:39.724
# You hit the ground #

03:39.807 --> 03:41.226
# Bang bang #

03:41.309 --> 03:43.895
# That awful sound #

03:43.978 --> 03:46.564
# Bang bang #

03:46.648 --> 03:51.319
# I used to shoot you down #

03:58.661 --> 04:03.332
# Music played
and people sang #

04:03.415 --> 04:08.003
# Just for me
the church bells rang #

04:17.346 --> 04:19.390
# Now he's gone #

04:19.473 --> 04:22.059
# I don't know why #

04:22.142 --> 04:26.939
# And till this day,
sometimes I cry #

04:27.022 --> 04:29.191
# He didn't even say goodbye #

04:29.275 --> 04:32.779
# He didn't take the time
to lie #

04:32.862 --> 04:35.323
# Bang bang #

04:35.407 --> 04:36.741
# He shot me down #

04:36.825 --> 04:38.159
# Bang bang #

04:38.243 --> 04:39.452
# I hit the ground #

04:39.536 --> 04:42.247
# Bang bang #

04:42.330 --> 04:44.416
# That awful sound #

04:44.499 --> 04:47.377
# Bang bang #

04:47.460 --> 04:55.260
# My baby shot me down #

05:42.559 --> 05:44.603
Coming!

05:44.686 --> 05:46.772
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

06:50.753 --> 06:53.715
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

06:53.799 --> 06:56.593
I got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

07:06.019 --> 07:08.105
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

07:09.148 --> 07:12.359
Come on.
Bring it on.

07:51.566 --> 07:52.984
Mommy, I'm home.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.402
Hey, baby.

07:54.486 --> 07:56.404
How was school?

07:58.239 --> 08:01.117
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

08:01.201 --> 08:03.245
Oh.

08:03.329 --> 08:05.915
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

08:05.998 --> 08:08.334
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

08:08.417 --> 08:11.086
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

08:11.170 --> 08:13.464
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

08:13.547 --> 08:17.510
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

08:23.098 --> 08:26.769
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

08:26.852 --> 08:28.812
Hi, honey.

08:28.896 --> 08:30.648
I'm

08:30.731 --> 08:32.482
What's your name?

08:35.443 --> 08:37.696
Her name is Nikki.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.366
Nikki.

08:40.366 --> 08:42.994
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

08:44.788 --> 08:46.873
How old are you, Nikki?

08:49.084 --> 08:53.672
Nikki, asked you
a question.

08:53.755 --> 08:55.632
I'm 4.

08:55.715 --> 08:58.260
4 years old, eh?

08:58.718 --> 09:02.639
You know,
I had a little girl once.

09:04.099 --> 09:06.768
She'd be about 4 now.

09:09.688 --> 09:13.484
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

09:13.568 --> 09:14.652
to talk about.

09:14.735 --> 09:16.153
You can go in your room now.

09:16.237 --> 09:19.240
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

09:19.323 --> 09:21.158
Okay?

09:22.410 --> 09:24.036
Nikkia!

09:24.120 --> 09:26.372
In your room.
Now.

09:39.427 --> 09:41.679
You want some coffee?

09:41.762 --> 09:44.015
Yeah. Sure.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.025
This Pasadena homemaker's name

09:53.108 --> 09:54.192
is Jeanne Bell.

09:54.276 --> 09:56.403
Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.

09:56.486 --> 09:59.489
But back when we were
acquainted, four years ago,

09:59.573 --> 10:01.408
her name was Vernita Green.

10:01.491 --> 10:04.494
Her code name was Copperhead.

10:04.578 --> 10:06.330
Mine, Black Mamba.

10:06.413 --> 10:07.998
Do you have a towel?

10:09.207 --> 10:10.709
Yeah.

10:13.712 --> 10:15.047
Thanks.

10:15.130 --> 10:17.382
You still take cream and sugar?

10:17.466 --> 10:19.009
Yeah.

10:21.386 --> 10:24.098
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

10:24.182 --> 10:26.476
You suppose correctly.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.811
Look, bitch, I need to know

10:28.895 --> 10:31.564
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

10:31.648 --> 10:33.816
You can relax for now.

10:34.817 --> 10:38.655
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

10:39.822 --> 10:41.282
That's being more rational

10:41.366 --> 10:43.660
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

10:43.743 --> 10:47.914
It's mercy, compassion
and forgiveness I lack.

10:47.997 --> 10:50.124
Not rationality.

10:54.712 --> 10:56.214
Look.

10:56.297 --> 10:59.843
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.346
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

11:03.305 --> 11:05.307
You have every right
to want to get even.

11:05.391 --> 11:07.726
No, no, no, no, no.

11:07.810 --> 11:09.144
No.

11:09.228 --> 11:12.815
To get even, even Stephen,

11:12.898 --> 11:19.113
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

11:19.196 --> 11:24.118
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

11:24.201 --> 11:26.620
That'd be even, Vernita.

11:26.745 --> 11:28.914
That'd be about square.

11:28.997 --> 11:32.000
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

11:32.084 --> 11:33.628
But I can't.

11:35.004 --> 11:38.007
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

11:38.091 --> 11:42.053
Oh, great.
I don't care.

11:42.137 --> 11:43.722
Be that as it may,

11:43.805 --> 11:46.850
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

11:46.933 --> 11:51.312
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

11:51.396 --> 11:54.899
Bitch, you can stop right there.

11:56.025 --> 11:58.069
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

11:58.153 --> 11:59.821
before the eyes of your daughter

11:59.904 --> 12:02.490
does not mean parading her
around in front of me

12:02.574 --> 12:05.285
is gonna inspire sympathy.

12:05.368 --> 12:08.371
You and I have
unfinished business.

12:08.455 --> 12:10.666
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

12:10.750 --> 12:12.251
in the subsequent four years,

12:12.334 --> 12:16.547
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

12:17.673 --> 12:19.967
So when do we do this?

12:20.050 --> 12:21.927
It all depends.

12:22.011 --> 12:24.847
When do you wanna die?

12:24.930 --> 12:27.683
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

12:27.767 --> 12:29.268
How about tonight, bitch?

12:29.351 --> 12:31.562
Splendid.
Where?

12:31.645 --> 12:34.398
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach little league

12:34.482 --> 12:35.775
about a mile from here.

12:35.858 --> 12:38.194
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

12:38.277 --> 12:42.281
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.

12:42.364 --> 12:44.868
And we have us a knife fight.

12:44.951 --> 12:46.912
We won't be bothered.

12:46.995 --> 12:52.125
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

13:00.425 --> 13:03.136
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

13:03.220 --> 13:04.554
with an edged weapon.

13:04.638 --> 13:06.973
Fuck you, bitch.

13:07.057 --> 13:09.351
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

13:09.434 --> 13:13.730
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

13:13.897 --> 13:15.649
Black Mamba.

13:15.732 --> 13:18.610
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

13:18.693 --> 13:19.862
Weapon of choice?

13:19.946 --> 13:22.698
If you wanna stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

13:24.575 --> 13:26.911
Very funny, bitch.

13:26.994 --> 13:28.746
Very funny!

14:26.013 --> 14:30.184
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

14:31.603 --> 14:34.397
For that, I'm sorry.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.317
But you can take my word for it.

14:40.236 --> 14:42.780
Your mother had it coming.

14:57.503 --> 15:04.595
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

15:07.723 --> 15:09.850
I'll be waiting.

15:13.437 --> 15:16.273
For those regarded as warriors...

15:16.357 --> 15:18.692
When engaged in combat...

15:18.776 --> 15:24.406
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

15:26.200 --> 15:32.039
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...

15:36.627 --> 15:43.385
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

15:49.557 --> 15:55.563
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

16:20.297 --> 16:22.258
Come on out to Dallas.

16:22.341 --> 16:26.512
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

16:26.595 --> 16:28.723
And next, we got some record.

16:28.806 --> 16:31.934
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.

16:34.270 --> 16:37.481
# Well #

16:42.361 --> 16:47.533
# I'm just a single fellow
with a lot on my mind #

16:47.616 --> 16:50.287
# And I'm lookin' for me
a woman #

16:50.370 --> 16:52.581
# But she's mighty hard
to find #

16:52.664 --> 16:55.333
# Asked my country cousin #

16:55.417 --> 16:57.919
# Checked the hottest spots
in town #

16:58.003 --> 17:00.630
# Oh, that little bitty woman #

17:06.928 --> 17:12.099
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

17:12.184 --> 17:14.770
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

17:15.936 --> 17:19.566
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

17:21.818 --> 17:23.487
Give me a figure.

17:23.569 --> 17:25.364
Nine dead bodies.

17:25.448 --> 17:27.992
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

17:28.076 --> 17:30.912
Bride. Groom.

17:30.995 --> 17:32.705
Reverend.

17:32.789 --> 17:35.249
Reverend's wife.

17:35.333 --> 17:39.295
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

17:39.378 --> 17:41.839
It would appear
somebody objected to this

17:41.923 --> 17:44.801
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

17:49.013 --> 17:52.934
Good gravy, Marie.

17:58.106 --> 17:59.899
What'd I tell you, Pop?

17:59.982 --> 18:03.153
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

18:03.237 --> 18:06.031
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

18:06.115 --> 18:07.699
You're in a house of worship.

18:07.783 --> 18:09.368
Sorry, Pop.

18:11.161 --> 18:13.956
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

18:14.039 --> 18:18.043
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.463
Four, maybe five strong.

18:21.547 --> 18:23.590
How can you tell?

18:23.674 --> 18:26.343
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

18:27.761 --> 18:30.472
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.

18:30.556 --> 18:33.684
This is the work of a salty dog.

18:33.767 --> 18:36.646
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

18:36.729 --> 18:40.358
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

18:40.441 --> 18:43.736
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

18:43.820 --> 18:48.324
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

18:59.669 --> 19:01.462
Who's the bride?

19:01.546 --> 19:03.006
Don't know.

19:03.089 --> 19:05.008
The name
on the marriage certificate

19:05.091 --> 19:07.969
is Arlene Machiavelli.

19:08.052 --> 19:09.345
That's a fake.

19:09.429 --> 19:11.515
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

19:11.599 --> 19:13.100
on account of the dress.

19:13.184 --> 19:16.187
You can tell she was pregnant.

19:16.270 --> 19:17.980
Man would have to be a mad dog

19:18.063 --> 19:21.775
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

19:23.652 --> 19:25.738
Look at her.

19:27.615 --> 19:32.578
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

19:32.661 --> 19:35.414
She's a little
blood-spattered ángel.

19:39.084 --> 19:40.878
Son Number One?

19:40.961 --> 19:42.129
Yeah?

19:42.213 --> 19:46.760
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

22:21.543 --> 22:24.088
I might never have liked you.

22:25.547 --> 22:28.801
Point in fact, I despise you.

22:30.010 --> 22:34.139
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

22:37.309 --> 22:40.562
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

22:40.646 --> 22:43.650
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

22:43.733 --> 22:47.070
My gift to you.

22:53.827 --> 22:55.578
For fuck's sake.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.500
Hello, Bill.

23:02.168 --> 23:04.170
What's her condition?

23:04.254 --> 23:06.423
Comatose.

23:07.382 --> 23:08.716
Where is she?

23:08.800 --> 23:12.053
I'm standing over her right now.

23:12.137 --> 23:14.222
That's my girl.

23:17.059 --> 23:19.562
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

23:19.645 --> 23:20.855
What?

23:20.938 --> 23:22.523
We owe her better than that.

23:22.606 --> 23:24.358
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

23:24.442 --> 23:26.068
Will you keep your voice down?

23:26.152 --> 23:28.028
You don't owe her shit!

23:28.112 --> 23:30.197
May I say one thing?

23:30.281 --> 23:32.116
Speak.

23:33.284 --> 23:35.202
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

23:35.286 --> 23:37.163
But you didn't kill her.

23:37.246 --> 23:39.206
And I put a bullet in her head.

23:39.290 --> 23:42.460
But her heart
just kept on beating.

23:42.543 --> 23:44.128
Now, you saw that yourself

23:44.211 --> 23:49.008
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

23:49.884 --> 23:53.388
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

23:53.472 --> 23:58.977
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

23:59.060 --> 24:00.979
But one thing we won't do

24:01.062 --> 24:05.442
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

24:05.525 --> 24:08.403
and kill her in her sleep.

24:09.488 --> 24:12.157
And the reason
we won't do that thing

24:12.240 --> 24:17.162
is because that thing
would lower us.

24:17.245 --> 24:19.623
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

24:21.500 --> 24:22.834
I guess.

24:22.918 --> 24:25.420
Do you really have to guess?

24:25.545 --> 24:27.590
No.

24:27.673 --> 24:31.427
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.056
Come on home, honey.

24:36.307 --> 24:38.434
Affirmative.

24:39.602 --> 24:41.812
I love you very much.

24:41.896 --> 24:43.940
I love you, too.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.611
Bye-bye.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.209
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

25:05.337 --> 25:08.382
Word of advice, shithead.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.510
Don't you ever wake up.

25:46.087 --> 25:53.011
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

25:53.094 --> 25:56.264
Bill, it's your baby.

26:58.161 --> 27:01.915
Oh, my baby.

27:27.233 --> 27:29.610
Four years.

27:29.694 --> 27:31.278
Four years.

28:00.809 --> 28:03.311
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

28:03.395 --> 28:05.313
You getting your freak on
or what?

28:05.397 --> 28:07.232
Oh, yeah, boy.

28:11.611 --> 28:13.572
20, 40, 60, 75.

28:13.655 --> 28:15.615
Yeah.
Now here's the rules.

28:15.699 --> 28:17.409
Rule number one.

28:17.492 --> 28:18.577
No punching her.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.454
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

28:20.537 --> 28:22.080
or less some teeth, jig's up.

28:22.164 --> 28:24.541
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

28:24.624 --> 28:26.626
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

28:26.710 --> 28:30.088
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

28:30.172 --> 28:33.176
- Now, are clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

28:33.259 --> 28:36.387
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

28:36.471 --> 28:39.098
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

28:39.182 --> 28:42.310
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

28:42.727 --> 28:44.479
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

28:44.562 --> 28:46.147
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

28:46.230 --> 28:48.107
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

28:48.191 --> 28:49.942
I'll be back in 20.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.528
Yeah.

28:52.612 --> 28:54.363
Oh, shit.

28:54.447 --> 28:56.949
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

28:57.033 --> 28:59.619
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

28:59.702 --> 29:03.122
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

29:04.165 --> 29:06.083
Bon appetit, good buddy.

29:15.552 --> 29:18.180
Oh, yeah.

29:20.140 --> 29:21.266
Oh, God damn.

29:21.350 --> 29:23.977
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

30:12.861 --> 30:15.405
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

30:15.488 --> 30:17.156
Coming in, ready or not.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.910
Hey buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

30:52.526 --> 30:54.070
Where's Bill?

30:54.696 --> 30:56.781
Where's Bill?

30:57.949 --> 30:59.242
Please stop hitting me.

30:59.326 --> 31:00.493
Where's Bill?

31:02.120 --> 31:03.622
I don't know who Bill is!

31:03.705 --> 31:05.206
Bullshit!

31:12.923 --> 31:16.676
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

31:16.760 --> 31:19.930
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

31:20.013 --> 31:21.973
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

31:22.057 --> 31:25.852
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

31:29.315 --> 31:31.943
Your name is Buck.

31:32.026 --> 31:33.611
Right?

31:33.694 --> 31:36.948
And you came here to fuck.

31:37.031 --> 31:38.366
Right?

31:38.449 --> 31:40.493
Wait a minute.
Wait.

32:06.019 --> 32:08.021
"Pussy Wagon."

32:08.105 --> 32:09.982
You fucker.

32:37.134 --> 32:40.138
Texas. Okay.

34:25.746 --> 34:28.541
Wiggle your big toe.

34:32.753 --> 34:35.880
Wiggle your big toe.

34:42.972 --> 34:45.683
Wiggle your big toe.

34:50.020 --> 34:53.274
Wiggle your big toe.

34:58.070 --> 34:59.990
Wiggle your big toe.

35:00.073 --> 35:02.284
As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,

35:02.367 --> 35:05.078
trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...

35:05.162 --> 35:06.830
Wiggle your big toe.

35:06.913 --> 35:10.834
...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.

35:10.917 --> 35:13.795
And the dicks responsible.

35:15.088 --> 35:20.260
Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.

35:22.596 --> 35:24.347
When fortune smiles
on something

35:24.431 --> 35:26.683
as violent and ugly as revenge,

35:26.766 --> 35:30.896
it seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,

35:30.979 --> 35:33.106
you're doing his will.

35:33.190 --> 35:35.776
At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,

35:35.860 --> 35:37.945
the first name
on my death list,

35:38.029 --> 35:41.782
O-Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.

35:41.866 --> 35:44.452
But when one
manages the difficult task

35:44.535 --> 35:46.996
of becoming queen
of the Tokio underworld,

35:47.079 --> 35:50.249
one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?

36:03.638 --> 36:07.391
O-Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base

36:07.475 --> 36:09.560
in Tokio, Japan.

36:09.644 --> 36:13.065
The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American Army brat

36:13.148 --> 36:16.485
made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.

36:16.568 --> 36:18.862
It was at that age
she witnessed

36:18.946 --> 36:20.822
the death of her parents
at the hands

36:20.906 --> 36:26.578
of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.

39:41.529 --> 39:43.030
Mommy.

40:52.602 --> 40:54.896
She swore revenge.

40:54.979 --> 41:00.109
Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.

41:02.237 --> 41:06.157
At 11, she got her revenge.

41:08.868 --> 41:13.206
Look at me, Matsumoto...

41:14.499 --> 41:18.211
...take a good look at my face.

41:19.671 --> 41:22.298
Look at my eyes.

41:24.842 --> 41:27.096
Look at my mouth.

41:27.805 --> 41:29.557
Do I look familiar?

41:31.934 --> 41:34.395
Do I look like somebody...

41:34.478 --> 41:36.647
you murdered?!

42:49.388 --> 42:54.393
By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.

43:41.817 --> 43:44.653
At 25, she did her part
in the killing

43:44.736 --> 43:49.200
of nine innocent people,
including my unborn daughter,

43:49.283 --> 43:54.163
in a small wedding chapel
in El Paso, Texas.

43:54.247 --> 44:01.879
But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.

44:01.963 --> 44:04.590
She should have killed 10.

44:05.216 --> 44:09.429
However, before satisfaction
would be mine,

44:09.512 --> 44:11.723
first things first.

44:11.806 --> 44:14.809
Wiggle your big toe.

44:21.649 --> 44:23.819
Hard part's over.

44:23.902 --> 44:27.990
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

45:02.484 --> 45:04.569
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

45:04.652 --> 45:06.946
Okinawa.
One-way.

45:33.974 --> 45:35.100
Hi.

45:35.184 --> 45:37.520
Welcome...

45:41.607 --> 45:43.526
Welcome.

45:44.735 --> 45:46.737
You English?

45:46.862 --> 45:49.198
Almost.
American.

45:49.281 --> 45:52.952
American.
Welcome, American.

45:53.035 --> 45:54.411
Domo.

45:54.495 --> 45:57.122
My English very good.

45:57.206 --> 45:58.790
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?

45:58.791 --> 46:00.459
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?

46:00.543 --> 46:01.627
No, no.

46:01.710 --> 46:04.588
Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.

46:04.672 --> 46:07.258
Um, may I sit at the bar?

46:07.341 --> 46:09.761
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please, sit.

46:13.682 --> 46:16.518
What other words did you learn?

46:16.601 --> 46:18.562
Oh, just a minute.

46:18.645 --> 46:23.149
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

46:23.233 --> 46:26.152
I'm watching my soap operas.

46:26.236 --> 46:29.698
Lazy bastard...

46:29.781 --> 46:31.700
Screw your soap opera... Hurry up!

46:31.783 --> 46:33.159
The tea's hot.

46:33.243 --> 46:35.453
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

46:35.537 --> 46:37.122
Shut up!

46:37.205 --> 46:39.958
Get your ass out here!

46:40.041 --> 46:42.294
Uh, excuse me.

46:43.963 --> 46:47.466
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

46:47.550 --> 46:48.759
Oh, let's see.

46:48.843 --> 46:50.720
Um, "arigato."

46:50.803 --> 46:53.264
"Arigato."
Good!

46:53.347 --> 46:57.268
Um, I already said "domo,"
right?

46:57.351 --> 46:59.896
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:59.979 --> 47:01.105
"Konn-itch-iwa."

47:02.815 --> 47:04.734
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

47:04.817 --> 47:06.235
Konnichi wa.
Please repeat.

47:06.319 --> 47:07.737
Konnichi wa.

47:07.820 --> 47:09.030
Perfect.

47:09.113 --> 47:10.698
Good, good, good.

47:10.781 --> 47:13.618
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

47:13.701 --> 47:15.244
Oh, you're making fun of me!

47:15.328 --> 47:17.915
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

47:17.998 --> 47:21.126
Pronunciation very good.

47:21.209 --> 47:25.797
You say arigato
like we say arigato.

47:28.550 --> 47:32.095
Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.

47:33.722 --> 47:36.141
You should learn Japanese.

47:36.224 --> 47:38.226
Very easy.

47:38.310 --> 47:40.354
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

47:40.437 --> 47:42.439
Most difficult.

47:42.522 --> 47:45.484
But you have Japanese tongue.

47:47.945 --> 47:49.529
Okay, okay.

47:52.115 --> 47:56.120
Oh.
Oh, my God.

47:56.204 --> 48:02.669
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea.
Hurry up... goddammit!

48:06.422 --> 48:10.176
Lazy oaf...

48:14.597 --> 48:17.308
What d'ya want?

48:17.392 --> 48:18.851
I beg your pardon?

48:18.935 --> 48:22.146
Uh, drink.

48:22.230 --> 48:23.439
Oh, yes.

48:23.523 --> 48:26.025
A bottle of warm sake, please.

48:26.109 --> 48:27.902
Warm sake?

48:27.987 --> 48:29.822
Very good!

48:29.905 --> 48:31.490
One warm sake!

48:31.573 --> 48:34.576
Sake? In the middle of the day?

48:35.411 --> 48:39.456
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

48:39.540 --> 48:42.167
How come I always have to get the sake?

48:42.251 --> 48:43.919
You listen well...

48:44.044 --> 48:47.172
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

48:47.256 --> 48:49.466
If this were the military,

48:49.550 --> 48:53.095
I'd be General by now.

48:53.178 --> 48:55.931
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

48:56.056 --> 48:59.810
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,

48:59.893 --> 49:02.061
and you'd still get the sake -

49:02.062 --> 49:04.733
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

49:04.816 --> 49:05.859
Do you understand?

49:05.942 --> 49:07.944
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.

49:08.028 --> 49:09.904
Do you understand me?

49:13.116 --> 49:14.826
Sorry.

49:17.162 --> 49:20.123
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

49:20.206 --> 49:21.583
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

49:21.666 --> 49:24.878
What brings you to Okinawa?

49:24.961 --> 49:26.713
I came to see a man.

49:26.796 --> 49:29.382
Oh, yeah.

49:29.466 --> 49:32.385
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

49:32.469 --> 49:34.054
Not quite.

49:34.137 --> 49:35.847
Not friend?

49:35.930 --> 49:37.265
I never met him.

49:37.348 --> 49:39.143
Never?

49:39.226 --> 49:41.395
Who is he?

49:41.479 --> 49:42.813
May I ask?

49:43.814 --> 49:46.442
Hattori Hanzo.

49:58.496 --> 50:01.665
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.961
I need Japanese steel.

50:07.755 --> 50:11.342
Why do you need Japanese steel?

50:12.635 --> 50:15.764
I have vermin to kill.

50:18.683 --> 50:24.523
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

50:26.900 --> 50:28.777
Huge.

51:56.366 --> 51:58.702
May I?

51:58.785 --> 52:00.538
You may.

52:03.416 --> 52:04.918
Wait.

52:05.001 --> 52:07.545
Try the second one down.

53:00.474 --> 53:02.434
Funny.

53:02.518 --> 53:04.979
You like samurai swords.

53:07.731 --> 53:10.443
I like baseball.

53:17.867 --> 53:21.538
I wanted to show you these.

53:21.621 --> 53:23.540
However...

53:23.623 --> 53:27.877
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

53:28.295 --> 53:34.217
...I no longer make instruments of death.

53:34.301 --> 53:36.094
What I have here...

53:36.928 --> 53:42.934
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

53:43.018 --> 53:48.649
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

53:52.361 --> 53:56.032
...I have retired.

54:03.956 --> 54:06.125
Then give me one of these.

54:06.208 --> 54:08.544
These are not for sale.

54:09.754 --> 54:12.131
I didn't say "sell me."

54:12.214 --> 54:14.133
I said "give me."

54:16.218 --> 54:19.473
Why should I help you?

54:19.598 --> 54:24.436
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

54:27.064 --> 54:30.442
And considering the student,

54:30.525 --> 54:35.655
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

55:31.839 --> 55:33.715
You can sleep here.

55:34.758 --> 55:37.136
It will take me a month...

55:39.763 --> 55:41.432
...to make the sword.

55:42.558 --> 55:45.310
I suggest you spend it practicing.

57:13.567 --> 57:15.820
I've completed doing...

57:17.155 --> 57:21.576
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

57:23.537 --> 57:26.831
...to never do again.

57:29.709 --> 57:33.088
I have created "something that kills people."

57:35.173 --> 57:41.304
And in that purpose, I was a success.

57:43.932 --> 57:46.393
I've done this because philosophically,

57:47.435 --> 57:53.025
I am sympathetic to your aim.

57:56.028 --> 58:01.701
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

58:02.618 --> 58:06.205
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

58:06.289 --> 58:09.458
...God will be cut.

58:21.762 --> 58:24.682
Yellow-haired warrior...

58:24.765 --> 58:27.352
Go.

58:27.436 --> 58:29.313
Domo.

58:50.250 --> 58:53.920
It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas

58:54.004 --> 58:56.006
that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny

58:56.089 --> 58:58.342
financially
and philosophically in her

58:58.425 --> 59:00.803
Shakespearian-in-magnitude
power struggle

59:00.887 --> 59:02.347
with the other yakuza clans

59:02.430 --> 59:06.476
over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokio.

59:06.559 --> 59:08.853
When the final sword
was sheathed,

59:08.936 --> 59:12.023
it was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse...

59:13.274 --> 59:16.569
...the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.

59:19.030 --> 59:20.948
The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,

59:21.032 --> 59:23.576
who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"

59:23.660 --> 59:27.121
is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.

59:27.205 --> 59:31.876
The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.

59:31.959 --> 59:35.296
Another former protegee
of Bill's.

59:37.758 --> 59:39.968
The young girl
in the school-girl uniform

59:40.052 --> 59:45.349
is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.

59:45.432 --> 59:48.894
Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,

59:48.977 --> 59:51.438
she makes up for in madness.

59:51.522 --> 59:53.565
Do you like Ferraris?

59:57.027 --> 59:59.488
Ferrari... ltalian trash.

01:00:08.956 --> 01:00:10.624
Do you want to screw me?

01:00:12.127 --> 01:00:15.839
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

01:00:16.756 --> 01:00:18.216
Yes.

01:00:21.636 --> 01:00:23.638
How 'bout now, big boy?

01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:27.183
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

01:00:29.144 --> 01:00:31.019
...or is it I...

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.189
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

01:00:34.315 --> 01:00:36.401
See what I mean?

01:00:37.819 --> 01:00:42.407
The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:46.912
the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.

01:00:48.664 --> 01:00:50.958
And just in case
you were wondering

01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:54.920
how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American

01:00:55.004 --> 01:00:59.800
become the boss of all bosses
in Tokio, Japan,

01:00:59.884 --> 01:01:01.677
I'll tell you.

01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:04.346
The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:07.099
came up before the council
only once.

01:01:07.183 --> 01:01:12.104
The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.

01:01:12.188 --> 01:01:14.565
The man who seems bound
and determined

01:01:14.648 --> 01:01:17.109
to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.

01:01:17.193 --> 01:01:20.029
And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...

01:01:24.451 --> 01:01:25.869
Boss Tanaka!

01:01:25.952 --> 01:01:27.788
What's the meaning of this outburst?

01:01:27.871 --> 01:01:29.915
This is a time for celebration!

01:01:29.998 --> 01:01:33.293
And what exactly are we celebrating?

01:01:34.294 --> 01:01:36.546
The perversion of our illustrious council?

01:01:38.381 --> 01:01:41.635
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

01:01:41.718 --> 01:01:43.053
I will not tolerate this!

01:01:43.136 --> 01:01:45.722
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

01:01:46.473 --> 01:01:52.395
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

01:01:57.235 --> 01:01:59.403
My father...

01:01:59.487 --> 01:02:00.655
...along with yours,

01:02:00.738 --> 01:02:03.199
and along with yours,
started this council.

01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:04.700
And while...

01:02:04.784 --> 01:02:06.452
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

01:02:06.536 --> 01:02:08.454
...they weep in the afterlife...

01:02:09.038 --> 01:02:10.581
Shut up!

01:02:10.665 --> 01:02:12.917
...over the perversion committed today!

01:02:13.584 --> 01:02:16.504
Outrageous!

01:02:16.587 --> 01:02:18.798
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

01:02:18.881 --> 01:02:20.174
Bastard!

01:02:20.967 --> 01:02:22.301
Fuck face!

01:02:22.385 --> 01:02:24.011
Gentlemen.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:31.603
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

01:02:33.438 --> 01:02:38.026
By all means, allow him to express it.

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:43.198
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.785
...which I love...

01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:48.704
...more than my own children,

01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:54.459
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:21.321
So that you understand how serious I am...

01:03:21.404 --> 01:03:23.740
...I'm going to say this in English.

01:03:37.337 --> 01:03:39.756
As your leader...

01:03:39.839 --> 01:03:41.758
I encourage you from time to time,

01:03:41.841 --> 01:03:45.846
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:47.181
If you're unconvinced

01:03:47.264 --> 01:03:49.725
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

01:03:49.808 --> 01:03:51.018
tell me so.

01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:52.728
But allow me to convince you.

01:03:52.811 --> 01:03:54.855
And I promise you,
right here and now,

01:03:54.939 --> 01:03:58.484
no subject will ever be taboo.

01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:01.862
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

01:04:04.281 --> 01:04:05.741
The price you pay

01:04:05.824 --> 01:04:09.119
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

01:04:09.203 --> 01:04:13.040
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

01:04:13.123 --> 01:04:15.501
Just like this fucker here.

01:04:17.379 --> 01:04:20.382
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:25.303
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

01:04:27.389 --> 01:04:28.974
I didn't think so.

01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:35.146
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:37.691
One ticket to Tokio, please.

01:07:12.432 --> 01:07:13.685
Moshi moshi.

01:08:49.573 --> 01:08:50.908
Hey!

01:08:53.078 --> 01:08:54.703
- Hey, yeah!
- Hey, yeah!

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:35.747
Gogo.

01:11:49.717 --> 01:11:52.762
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

01:11:52.846 --> 01:11:54.348
They demand ridiculous things.

01:11:54.432 --> 01:11:57.101
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

01:11:57.184 --> 01:11:58.185
What's gonna happen?

01:11:58.269 --> 01:11:59.645
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

01:11:59.728 --> 01:12:01.564
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

01:12:01.647 --> 01:12:03.065
No, I don't want that.

01:12:50.447 --> 01:12:51.990
Yes, it's me.

01:12:55.702 --> 01:12:59.164
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

01:13:14.347 --> 01:13:17.308
Who do you remind me of?

01:13:18.351 --> 01:13:20.228
Charlie Brown!

01:13:21.354 --> 01:13:23.773
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

01:13:23.856 --> 01:13:25.191
Charlie Brown.

01:13:25.274 --> 01:13:26.651
Four pepperoni pizzas.

01:13:26.734 --> 01:13:28.569
That's not on our menu...

01:13:28.653 --> 01:13:30.655
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

01:13:31.739 --> 01:13:34.742
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

01:13:36.077 --> 01:13:38.246
O-Ren Ishii!

01:13:39.372 --> 01:13:42.125
You and I have unfinished business!

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.553
Charlie Brown, beat it.

01:15:22.227 --> 01:15:23.812
Miki.

01:15:41.665 --> 01:15:43.792
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:19.390
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?

01:17:20.892 --> 01:17:22.769
Hi!

01:17:23.853 --> 01:17:25.813
Gogo, right?

01:17:26.773 --> 01:17:28.274
Bingo.

01:17:28.357 --> 01:17:30.318
And you're Black Mamba.

01:17:32.028 --> 01:17:35.656
Our reputations precede us.

01:17:36.532 --> 01:17:38.326
Don't they?

01:17:39.911 --> 01:17:45.208
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:48.796
But I beg you.

01:17:48.879 --> 01:17:50.923
Walk away.

01:17:57.262 --> 01:17:59.264
You call that begging?

01:18:04.895 --> 01:18:08.232
You can beg better than that.

01:21:21.931 --> 01:21:23.891
Is that what I think it is?

01:21:23.975 --> 01:21:26.686
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

01:21:26.769 --> 01:21:34.068
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

01:21:34.944 --> 01:21:36.821
Silly rabbit.

01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:38.322
Trix are for...

01:21:38.406 --> 01:21:39.490
Kids.

01:26:01.635 --> 01:26:02.928
# I'm doin'#

01:26:03.012 --> 01:26:04.972
# Ain't nobody doin' but me #

01:26:05.055 --> 01:26:06.765
# Nobody but me #

01:26:06.849 --> 01:26:08.809
# Yes, I gonna philly,
I'm doin'? #

01:26:08.892 --> 01:26:11.145
# Ain't nobody doin' but me,
baby #

01:26:11.228 --> 01:26:12.563
# Nobody but me #

01:26:12.646 --> 01:26:15.649
# Well, let me tell you
nobody #

01:26:15.733 --> 01:26:18.485
# Nobody but me #

01:26:18.569 --> 01:26:20.446
# Well, let me tell you
nobody #

01:26:20.529 --> 01:26:21.989
# Nobody #

01:28:08.306 --> 01:28:12.894
This is what you get
for fucking around with yakuzas!

01:28:12.978 --> 01:28:14.855
Go home to your mother!

01:29:13.499 --> 01:29:16.335
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

01:29:16.418 --> 01:29:19.171
...take them with you!

01:29:20.756 --> 01:29:22.257
However...

01:29:23.509 --> 01:29:27.596
...leave the limbs you've lost.

01:29:28.765 --> 01:29:32.268
They belong to me now.

01:29:36.731 --> 01:29:39.567
Except you, Sofie!

01:29:40.276 --> 01:29:43.446
You stay right where you are.

01:30:36.917 --> 01:30:39.421
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

01:30:43.842 --> 01:30:46.011
Where was it made?

01:30:47.512 --> 01:30:49.180
Okinawa.

01:30:50.724 --> 01:30:54.060
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

01:30:54.978 --> 01:30:57.147
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

01:30:57.230 --> 01:30:58.648
YOU LIE!

01:31:10.952 --> 01:31:13.663
Swords however, never get tired.

01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:18.419
I hope you've saved your energy.

01:31:21.964 --> 01:31:23.716
If you haven't...

01:31:25.051 --> 01:31:27.637
...you might not last five minutes.

01:31:29.639 --> 01:31:31.807
But as last looks go,

01:31:32.808 --> 01:31:34.810
you could do worse.

01:34:13.432 --> 01:34:18.103
Silly Caucasian girl
likes to play with samurai swords.

01:34:20.356 --> 01:34:23.234
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

01:34:26.362 --> 01:34:29.573
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

01:34:59.938 --> 01:35:01.648
Attack me...

01:35:02.566 --> 01:35:04.276
...with everything you have.

01:35:59.166 --> 01:36:02.085
For ridiculing you earlier...

01:36:04.546 --> 01:36:06.798
...I apologize.

01:36:15.098 --> 01:36:16.850
Accepted.

01:36:32.825 --> 01:36:34.327
Ready?

01:36:38.539 --> 01:36:40.291
Come on.

01:37:13.242 --> 01:37:22.543
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

01:39:28.422 --> 01:39:30.091
Sofie.

01:39:30.883 --> 01:39:32.635
Sofie.

01:39:32.718 --> 01:39:34.428
My Sofie.

01:39:34.512 --> 01:39:36.848
I'm so sorry.

01:39:39.976 --> 01:39:43.354
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

01:39:43.437 --> 01:39:45.189
No more of that.

01:39:45.648 --> 01:39:47.441
But still...

01:39:47.525 --> 01:39:49.652
But still nothing.

01:39:51.654 --> 01:39:55.032
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

01:39:55.116 --> 01:39:58.035
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

01:39:59.078 --> 01:40:02.082
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

01:40:02.166 --> 01:40:04.293
The first reason is information.

01:40:04.376 --> 01:40:08.462
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

01:40:08.463 --> 01:40:09.840
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

01:40:11.216 --> 01:40:15.345
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

01:40:15.429 --> 01:40:19.474
And every time
you don't give me answers,

01:40:19.558 --> 01:40:22.060
I'm gonna cut something off.

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:28.859
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.737
Give me your other arm!

01:40:34.239 --> 01:40:38.369
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

01:40:38.453 --> 01:40:39.871
If you had to guess...

01:40:39.954 --> 01:40:41.414
What they've been doing.

01:40:41.497 --> 01:40:42.832
Why she left you alive...

01:40:42.916 --> 01:40:44.626
And where I can find them.

01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:47.503
What would be your guess?

01:40:48.504 --> 01:40:51.132
Guessing won't be necessary.

01:40:51.216 --> 01:40:53.301
She informed me.

01:40:55.637 --> 01:40:59.265
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

01:41:00.391 --> 01:41:01.893
As I said before,

01:41:01.976 --> 01:41:05.521
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

01:41:06.648 --> 01:41:11.946
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

01:41:12.029 --> 01:41:15.824
everything that happened
here tonight.

01:41:15.908 --> 01:41:19.245
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

01:41:19.328 --> 01:41:22.915
by witnessing
your deformed body.

01:41:22.998 --> 01:41:27.169
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

01:41:27.253 --> 01:41:30.297
I want him to know what I know.

01:41:30.381 --> 01:41:34.593
I want him to know
I want him to know.

01:41:34.677 --> 01:41:37.096
And I want them all to know

01:41:37.179 --> 01:41:43.852
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

01:42:06.751 --> 01:42:12.340
Revenge is never a straight line.

01:42:15.051 --> 01:42:16.845
It's a forest.

01:42:17.804 --> 01:42:21.016
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

01:42:21.976 --> 01:42:25.396
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

01:42:28.733 --> 01:42:32.570
That woman deserves her revenge.

01:42:37.783 --> 01:42:42.246
And we deserve to die.

01:42:45.624 --> 01:42:49.587
She must suffer
to her last breath.

01:43:02.351 --> 01:43:05.270
How did you find me?

01:43:05.354 --> 01:43:07.105
I'm the man.

01:43:11.026 --> 01:43:14.446
One more thing, Sofie.

01:43:14.529 --> 01:43:19.534
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?

01:43:20.305 --> 01:43:26.515
