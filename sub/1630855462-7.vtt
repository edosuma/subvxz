08:59.039 --> 09:02.710
in what the Western world
calls 1262.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.645
But we're gonna
forget about that

09:04.645 --> 09:08.315
and just call it the year O.

09:08.315 --> 09:12.486
Whatever, man.
History is subjective.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.388
I mean, teach what you want,

09:14.388 --> 09:16.323
but just know that history

09:16.323 --> 09:18.525
is written by the oppressors.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.428
<i>One of the biggest and most</i>

09:21.428 --> 09:24.365
commonly-used
energy drains imaginable

09:24.365 --> 09:25.733
is being

09:25.733 --> 09:27.568
<i>the cool teacher.</i>

09:27.568 --> 09:30.237
I used to have
a bumper sticker that said,

09:30.237 --> 09:32.640
"I rather be reading Bukowski."

09:32.640 --> 09:34.108
It was pretty rad.

09:34.108 --> 09:36.210
Uh, I have a little gift
for you guys.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.711
Some condoms.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.214
I want you guys
to be healthy out there.

09:40.214 --> 09:43.083
You don't have to be in love
to wear the glove.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.585
- Right, Lorraine?
- [Nandor] <i>Colin Robinson</i>

09:44.585 --> 09:46.587
<i>has tricked my pupils
into thinking</i>

09:46.587 --> 09:48.789
<i>- that they are learning.</i>
- [chuckles]

09:48.789 --> 09:50.658
Meanwhile, I have not
heard the word "history"

09:50.658 --> 09:52.726
or Al Qolnidar mentioned once.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.328
[Colin]
Let me tell you about Hamlet.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.363
A prince of a castle.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.299
You wince,
but his hassle

09:58.299 --> 10:00.668
was the death of...
his daddy.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.069
A baddy? No.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.337
But sad he was

10:03.337 --> 10:04.738
- when the lad said, "Egad,"
- [growls]

10:04.738 --> 10:07.641
a prince driven mad,
ya boy got had.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.544
[Nandor]
<i>What is even worse
is that he keeps sitting up</i>

10:10.544 --> 10:12.346
<i>on the desk
with his legs crossed</i>

10:12.346 --> 10:13.747
<i>so that everyone can see his nut</i>

10:13.747 --> 10:15.382
<i>hanging out his short.</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:18.485
[Guillermo]
<i>You can talk?</i>

10:18.485 --> 10:20.521
- You're, like, real people?
- [bleating]

10:20.521 --> 10:22.156
Why didn't you tell me
you could talk?

10:22.156 --> 10:23.824
I guess we can be shy sometimes.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.793
What, you open up to people
right off the bat?

10:25.793 --> 10:28.262
Well, no, not usually, I guess
I take a second,

10:28.262 --> 10:29.663
yeah, but--

10:29.663 --> 10:32.499
- I made an oopsie, Daddy.
- No, no one's Daddy.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.468
But Daddy Gemerno,

10:34.468 --> 10:36.637
- the oopsie is getting bad.
- [Guillermo] Oh, shit.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.805
Ugh, what'd you eat?

10:37.805 --> 10:39.073
Uh, listen, Daddy, I kind of

10:39.073 --> 10:40.674
made the froggie pregnant.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.043
- What?
- I want raw meat.
- Da-da,

10:43.043 --> 10:44.678
- my oopsie's really bad.
- [bleating] Da-da.
- [dog] What's the plan, Daddy?

10:44.678 --> 10:47.081
- Come on!
- I want to go outside.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh!

10:47.081 --> 10:49.216
Stop talking.
I got to think, I got to think.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.453
Laszlo wants me to, you know,
get rid of you.

10:52.453 --> 10:54.688
What means "get rid of"?

10:54.688 --> 10:57.024
- Um...
- Our elders spoke of a prophecy

10:57.024 --> 10:59.326
of the one true Guillermo
who saves us.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.595
What are you talking about?
Elders? Who-who are your elders?

11:01.595 --> 11:03.530
He was born
15 minutes before me.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.099
Hello, young one.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.368
Rest easy, all.
Guillermo will save us.

11:07.368 --> 11:09.169
- Daddy, Daddy.
- [dog] Ain't that right, Daddy?
- I don't want to die.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.338
Shh! Stop, stop, stop,
stop talking.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.506
Fine. I'll save you.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.141
- Yeah!
- Thank you, Daddy.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.676
- But you can't
tell Laszlo, okay?
- Agreed.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.311
Is this all of you guys?

11:17.311 --> 11:18.679
- Where's-where's Binky?
- Who?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.247
Binky's the most
fragile among us.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.448
He lives in the koi pond.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.783
Find him, Guillermo.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.418
Okay, fine, I'll find him.
I'll find Binky.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.053
And you're all gonna stay put

11:26.053 --> 11:27.621
a-and not make a noise.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.189
All right?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.358
Do not think your bravery
will go unnoticed.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.793
- See her? This fetching bitch
- [whines]

11:32.793 --> 11:35.596
is my beautiful daughter.
You may lay with her.

11:35.596 --> 11:37.798
- No, I'm good.
I'm gonna take this gun.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.166
- [pig] We love you, Daddy.
- I'll be back.
- [dog] Daddy!

11:42.302 --> 11:44.371
Helen, I'm home!
[chuckles]

11:44.371 --> 11:46.106
So, I think I got everything.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.374
One monkey paw.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.344
- Great...
- Tears on a woman's love letter.

11:50.344 --> 11:54.181
Oh. Okay, so we're going
straight for the doughnut.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.150
Oh, I'm so sorry, they only had

11:56.150 --> 11:58.619
vanilla glazed
with rainbow sprinkles.

11:58.619 --> 12:01.055
What am I supposed
to do with this?

12:01.055 --> 12:02.690
Could you not use that for your

12:02.690 --> 12:03.724
magic potion?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.292
Has to be chocolate or...

12:05.292 --> 12:07.595
You think I can
put this in my big bowl?

12:07.595 --> 12:09.096
Do you mean a cauldron?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.165
Yes. That is the word.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.466
You're gonna
have to go back out.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.034
Of course, yes.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.338
And why don't you also grab me

12:17.338 --> 12:19.640
three Boston creams,

12:19.640 --> 12:22.343
three chocolate glazed,
four jelly

12:22.343 --> 12:25.512
and five glazed crullers.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.248
- What else?
- Do you think you might want

12:27.248 --> 12:29.350
more of witchy, spooky stuff?

12:29.350 --> 12:31.552
Uh, maybe, after we
get the Dunkin' sorted.

12:31.552 --> 12:33.621
[Nadja]
<i>I don't know much about hexes</i>

12:33.621 --> 12:35.556
or how to get rid of them, obviously.

12:35.556 --> 12:39.059
<i>Maybe the doughnut is something
to do with the circle of life?</i>

12:39.059 --> 12:42.129
<i>Also, Helen said
she had this magic wand</i>

12:42.129 --> 12:43.597
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

12:43.597 --> 12:46.066
But I'm pretty sure
I saw her go outside

12:46.066 --> 12:47.801
and pick up a stick
from the ground.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.037
- It was, like, a "crullan."
- Cruller.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.439
- "Crewlour."
- Cr-uller.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.775
"Crew-row-row... row-row-ler."

12:54.775 --> 12:55.809
Close enough.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.444
[humming a tune]

12:57.444 --> 12:59.513
[clattering in distance]

12:59.513 --> 13:02.383
What the fuck... Gizmo?
What are you

13:02.383 --> 13:04.184
doing in there--
are you wanking?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.820
- No! What?
- Well, I wouldn't
judge you if you were.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.390
I wank in there all the time.
30 minutes ago, to be precise.

13:09.390 --> 13:11.492
No. Actually, I'm trying to
catch one of your abominations.

13:11.492 --> 13:13.093
Listen, I understand
this kind of thing

13:13.093 --> 13:14.428
is not for the faint of heart.

13:14.428 --> 13:15.629
So if you don't
have the balls for it,

13:15.629 --> 13:17.330
- I don't mind stepping in.
- No.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.467
- I-I have the balls for it.
- Good.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.336
- Get out of my shed.
- Oh, you're gonna go and...

13:22.336 --> 13:23.470
- And wank.
- Yeah.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.772
- Yes!
- Okay.

13:24.772 --> 13:26.740
- And shut the door.
- Shut the door.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.376
Okay.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.545
Binky. [smooches]

13:31.545 --> 13:34.315
Hey, buddy.
Come on.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.416
Come on.

13:35.416 --> 13:37.384
Whoa, Nelly!

13:38.352 --> 13:39.753
[gasping]

13:39.753 --> 13:42.689
Daddy, what is "wank"?
[gasps]

13:46.660 --> 13:49.430
[out of tun

13:49.430 --> 13:51.264
I almost have it.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.801
Oh, I'm in the wrong spot.

13:53.801 --> 13:55.236
- [sighs]
- Hold on.

13:55.236 --> 13:57.071
- [in-tune chord]
- There.

13:57.071 --> 14:00.207
So, what did we just learn
about sound waves?

14:00.207 --> 14:01.475
Yeah. Lenore.

14:01.475 --> 14:02.743
When will learn about, uh,

14:02.743 --> 14:04.612
starting mortgage?

14:04.612 --> 14:07.147
Right after I play

14:07.147 --> 14:08.816
"Nightswimming" by R.E.M.

14:08.816 --> 14:10.451
- Uh, let's see--
- Colin Robinson,

14:10.451 --> 14:12.519
what are we doing outside?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.655
Having class on the quad, man.

14:14.655 --> 14:16.523
Kind of a college tradition.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.225
I catch your drift, though.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.362
How about we get
the old blood pumpin'

14:21.362 --> 14:25.266
- with some hacky sack?
- [grunts]

14:25.266 --> 14:26.700
- That's not cool.
- [thud]
- We are going

14:26.700 --> 14:28.202
- [car alarm blaring]
- to the history museum.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.170
- Who's with me?
- Museum? Is inside?

14:30.170 --> 14:33.240
Yes. Very much so.
Follow me!

14:33.240 --> 14:35.276
- Oh. [mutters]
- Who here has seen <i>Garden State?</i>

14:35.276 --> 14:37.711
There's a song in it
that I'd love for you guys

14:37.711 --> 14:39.746
to listen to by The Shins.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.784
This is from the Dunkin'

14:43.784 --> 14:46.220
on Forest and Broadway.
I said it must be

14:46.220 --> 14:49.556
- Forest and South.
- What? How can you even tell?

14:49.556 --> 14:52.192
Hello! I'm a magic woman.
I can tell everything.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.794
- [sighs]
- I will need a dozen more

14:53.794 --> 14:55.529
from the Forest and South location.

14:55.529 --> 14:56.797
Are you kidding me?

14:56.797 --> 14:59.099
How many donuts
do you need, lady?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.668
- [groans]
- Oh!

15:00.668 --> 15:02.469
Oh, Magic Woman,
what is happening?

15:02.469 --> 15:05.172
Oh, the hex.
It grows more powerful

15:05.172 --> 15:06.774
with each passing moment.

15:06.774 --> 15:09.209
- Oh, no.
- Oh, you must fetch me
one last thing.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.011
Yes, yes, anything.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.215
A dozen powdered Munchkins.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.619
Powder represents
the ashes of your ancestors.

15:18.619 --> 15:22.156
I will get you
a dozen powdered Munchkins.

15:22.156 --> 15:23.824
Stay with me, Helen!

15:23.824 --> 15:26.093
- [whimpering]
- Oh.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.462
- Piss!
- [stops whimpering]

15:28.462 --> 15:31.098
What are you doing?! Come on!

15:31.098 --> 15:33.601
[Nandor] <i>And you will not
call the police about us</i>

15:33.601 --> 15:36.370
being here while
the museum is closed.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.138
[quiet chatter]

15:38.138 --> 15:42.309
The entire history
of Staten Island!

15:42.309 --> 15:44.078
- Look at this.
- [Colin] This is a recreation

15:44.078 --> 15:47.715
of the 19th century
immigrant experience,

15:47.715 --> 15:49.717
based on old travel chests

15:49.717 --> 15:52.286
that were never claimed
from the customs house.

15:52.286 --> 15:54.555
This fellow
is wearing traditional

15:54.555 --> 15:57.124
Al-Qolnidarian gown.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.660
This is exactly
the kind of outfit I wore

15:59.660 --> 16:02.029
on my journey to America.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.231
And I do so love

16:04.231 --> 16:08.035
that this is from
the immigrant's perspective.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.739
So accurate,
down to the underwear.

16:11.739 --> 16:14.708
Those look very much
like a pair I used to own.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.543
Wait a minute.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.612
Those <i>are</i> a pair I used to own!

16:18.612 --> 16:22.082
How did these fuckers
get my stuff?!

16:22.883 --> 16:25.185
Donut wench, I need
a dozen powdered Munchkins,

16:25.185 --> 16:26.587
and make it quick.

16:26.587 --> 16:29.323
- A hex is killing my friend.
- Okey dokey.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.392
$5.07 for the Munchkins,

16:31.392 --> 16:33.494
and I'll ignore the other stuff.

16:33.494 --> 16:36.263
Wait--
Wait, hang on, that is her.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.566
That is my friend.
How do you know Helen?

16:38.566 --> 16:40.467
Um, I guess
I know her from, like,

16:40.467 --> 16:42.770
harassing me and my co-workers.

16:42.770 --> 16:44.438
That's mainly how.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.607
Hang on. Helen Johnson?

16:46.607 --> 16:49.610
I thought her name
was Helen the Magic Woman.

16:49.610 --> 16:52.179
[speaks Greek]

16:52.179 --> 16:54.748
Something here stinks
of a snake's shit.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.616
I have your Munchkins.

16:57.618 --> 16:59.353
We need to have a little chat.

16:59.353 --> 17:03.190
What is this?
Why does it say Helen Johnson

17:03.190 --> 17:04.692
when your name
is Helen the Magic Woman?

17:04.692 --> 17:08.529
I, um, never
told you my full name,

17:08.529 --> 17:12.399
which is
Helen "the Magic" Johnson.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.767
The hex
is playing tricks on you.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.336
This is textbook hex.

17:15.336 --> 17:17.071
The solution is a strawb--

17:17.071 --> 17:19.106
No! Ugh!

17:19.106 --> 17:20.273
Wait!

17:22.276 --> 17:24.745
You have no idea what it's like

17:24.745 --> 17:27.748
to not be allowed back
to the one place

17:27.748 --> 17:29.817
you feel at home.

17:29.817 --> 17:31.151
[sighs]

17:31.151 --> 17:32.353
<i>I do know what it is like</i>

17:32.353 --> 17:34.221
to be driven from the only place

17:34.221 --> 17:35.723
you have ever called home,

17:35.723 --> 17:38.292
<i>just as I was
driven out of my village.</i>

17:38.292 --> 17:39.526
It ain't great.
[short chuckle]

17:39.526 --> 17:41.528
My hex may not have been lifted,

17:41.528 --> 17:44.098
but with a little hypnosis,

17:44.098 --> 17:46.400
at least Helen's has been.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.372
Welcome home, sweet freak,
Helen "the Magic" Johnson.

17:51.372 --> 17:54.507
You "doughnut"
need to be sad anymore.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.612
"This immigrant probably
came from a small village

17:58.612 --> 18:01.148
"in the Near Middle East, one

18:01.148 --> 18:03.484
"with a particularly
weak army, based

18:03.484 --> 18:05.219
on their inferior weaponry."

18:05.219 --> 18:08.188
What?
Those are my travel weapons.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.725
"Also inside was
a well-worn good-luck amulet.

18:11.725 --> 18:15.663
"The Atlantic Crossing was
terrifying to most uneducated

18:15.663 --> 18:18.532
"travelers of the day,
and they sought comfort

18:18.532 --> 18:20.100
in superstitions--"

18:20.100 --> 18:22.202
I was not terrified of shit.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.605
And I don't even know
what an amulet is.

18:24.605 --> 18:27.074
That is a key chain
given to me by my mommy.

18:27.074 --> 18:29.610
[Colin]
It also says that the immigrant

18:29.610 --> 18:32.413
was a talented writer.

18:32.413 --> 18:35.749
- It does?
- "Stories about sexual escapades

18:35.749 --> 18:37.484
while flying in the sky."

18:37.484 --> 18:40.220
That's right-- sky fucking.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.555
Glad to see they've acknowledged

18:41.555 --> 18:43.424
some of the cool shit
that I've done.

18:43.424 --> 18:46.427
"It's a rare example
of early erotic fiction."

18:46.427 --> 18:48.495
Fiction?
This is not fiction.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.699
- This is my diary!
- [Colin] "It is likely
that, unable

18:51.699 --> 18:54.101
"to find a sexual partner,

18:54.101 --> 18:57.204

19:06.080 --> 19:07.447
[Nandor groaning, yelling]

19:11.118 --> 19:14.221
[Colin] Violence is the last
refuge of the incompetent.

- [squealing]

19:19.660 --> 19:21.729
[Laszlo]
I know it's tough,
Gizmo, but it must be done.

19:21.729 --> 19:24.231
Steady thy hand
and become death.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.666
But wait till I'm gone.
I don't want to be covered

19:25.666 --> 19:27.268
in brains and shit.

19:27.268 --> 19:28.602
- Au revoir.
- [bleats]

19:28.602 --> 19:30.104
Bye.

19:30.104 --> 19:32.072
- [whimpering]
- Shh.

19:32.072 --> 19:34.674
- [gunshots]
- [bleating]
- There we go.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.046
Thank you so much, Guillermo.

19:39.046 --> 19:41.047
- Hey, no one's dying on my wa--
- [creatures exclaiming]

19:42.115 --> 19:43.484
Oh! [grunts]

19:43.484 --> 19:45.286
- No. No, drop it. Drop it!
- [growling]

19:45.286 --> 19:47.554
Sorry about that.

19:49.523 --> 19:50.691
[Colin]
Hello.

19:50.691 --> 19:53.594
I thought you might want this

19:53.594 --> 19:55.496
key ring that
your mommy gave you.

19:55.496 --> 19:57.131
I stole it from the museum.

19:57.131 --> 19:59.133
Is this how history
is going to remember me,

19:59.133 --> 20:00.534
Colin Robinson,

20:00.534 --> 20:03.037
if it is going
to remember me at all?

20:03.037 --> 20:06.373
Well, I also took the liberty

20:06.373 --> 20:09.410
of rearranging
the museum display.

20:09.410 --> 20:11.278
<i>"This immigrant

"who set the world's record

- Sexual intercourse.

"Often while flying, and he was
never scared of boat rides."

20:23.290 --> 20:24.758
[Nandor]
<i>You're shitting me.</i>

20:24.758 --> 20:28.329
Whatever, you know?
Uh, history is a construct.

20:28.329 --> 20:30.030
Thank you, Colin Robinson.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.365
You are not just a cool teacher.

20:31.365 --> 20:33.734
You are also a cool friend.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.569
[singsongy] Awkward moment.
[short chuckle]

20:36.837 --> 20:39.206
- [brakes squeaks]
- Okay.

20:39.206 --> 20:41.775
Just remember:
never be seen by the staff.

20:41.775 --> 20:44.278
You're only safe
with the old people.

20:44.278 --> 20:46.680
- Okay.
- [bleating] I understand.
- Yes, we understand.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.049
[Guillermo]
<i>So I just dropped them off
at a retirement home</i>

20:49.049 --> 20:50.451
that my <i>tía</i> works at.

20:50.451 --> 20:52.086
