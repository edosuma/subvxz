00:03.000 --> 00:03.266
Previously this season
on "Below Deck."

00:04.700 --> 00:06.500
- We didn't really have a lot
to choose from for crew.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.033
- This is my first yacht.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.233
- Ready?

00:10.233 --> 00:11.233
- Get it to the goddamn dock.

00:11.233 --> 00:12.567
- Have you ironed very much?

00:12.567 --> 00:15.166
- Yes, I have
an 8-year-old little girl.

00:15.166 --> 00:16.567
- You're such a calm chef.

00:16.567 --> 00:18.133
- Matt's from Canada,

00:18.133 --> 00:19.533
which is, like,
a G-rated country.

00:19.533 --> 00:21.433
- Hi, Nico,
we met in Barcelona.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.433
He was very flirtatious,
very charming.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.567
- I miss you.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.433
- It's super hard
being away from Melissa,

00:27.433 --> 00:30.533
but life has changed
dramatically for me.

00:30.533 --> 00:32.533

they are doing right now?

00:35.367 --> 00:36.700
[loud bang]

00:36.700 --> 00:38.300
- Did they hit something?
- God damn it!

00:38.300 --> 00:39.667
- Are you a new crew
or something?

00:39.667 --> 00:41.600
- The new boatswain.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.734
- Why would you do two pieces
of fish in one dish?

00:43.734 --> 00:45.734
- You don't like it?
- I'm not even hungry anymore.

00:45.734 --> 00:47.200
- If it were my restaurant,

00:47.200 --> 00:49.166
a lot of things
would have been sent back.

00:49.166 --> 00:51.467
- I'm not getting the progress
out of the galley that I need.

00:51.467 --> 00:54.000
- She sucks at her job,
but she's hilarious.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
- I left my daughter
to go after my dream,

00:56.000 --> 00:57.400
but this is a living nightmare.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.200
- This is the fifth charter.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.600
If you don't have it by now,
there's no hope for you.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.066
- I just broke up
with my girlfriend.

01:02.066 --> 01:03.333
- Oh, my god,
we're holding hands.

01:03.333 --> 01:06.333
It's so official.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.200
- Morning, Nico.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.166
- It's hard to admit,
but since EJ's come onboard,

01:10.166 --> 01:12.000
the deck team
has come a long way.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.467
- When the charter ends,
I'm out of here.

01:13.467 --> 01:15.600
- Okay, move the fenders
over to this side.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.033
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.166
Lock it down.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.567
- Well done, everybody.

01:19.567 --> 01:22.300
- Well, look who it is.
- What's up?

01:26.066 --> 01:27.767
- Last charter, and if he wants
to go all out,

01:27.767 --> 01:29.500
the more extravagant,
the better.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.467
This is your moment to shine.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.367
- We have characters
for each crew member.

01:33.367 --> 01:35.200
- You're gonna be the mime.
- Cool.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.700
- Classic Kate, I knew she
would find a way

01:36.700 --> 01:38.233
to keep Jen from talking.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.767
- The plan is to stay here
after charter?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.333
- Nico and I talked about it.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.734
I'm pretty sure
we're still doing it.

01:42.734 --> 01:44.367
- I screwed up,
I love Melissa,

01:44.367 --> 01:46.333
and I want to go back home
and fully commit to her.

01:46.333 --> 01:49.200
- I don't need this sh--!

01:49.200 --> 01:50.467
May I say something, please?

01:50.467 --> 01:51.500
- This is not a conversation.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.300
This is a lecture.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.367
Hiring a new stewardess would
only be more work for me.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.633
I would love to have time
to be like,

01:57.633 --> 01:59.767
"Mm, my feelings are hurt."

without talking.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.467
- So does Chef have to sleep
in the fetal position?

05:19.467 --> 05:24.000
- Because he's so tall.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.734
- I love doing theme parties

05:25.734 --> 05:29.000
when I have more
than zero time.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.633
- We have a really good crew.

05:30.633 --> 05:32.133
I think it'll work.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.667
- I'm not worried
about the crew.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.433
- I'm not worried
about the second stew.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.433
Sometimes I'm worried
about the third stew.

to change into your costumes,

06:09.266 --> 06:11.033
because then you should be
coming back up here

06:11.033 --> 06:13.433
and making it
as festive as possible.

ten minutes changing.

will be ready.

to do this, anyway?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.333

06:51.333 --> 06:53.233
- I hear oysters
are an aphrodisiac.

06:53.233 --> 06:55.734

06:59.100 --> 07:00.767

07:07.467 --> 07:09.734

taking this too personal.

07:09.734 --> 07:11.367
- Welcome to Kate's world,
man.

07:11.367 --> 07:12.767
It's all business
for her, you know?

07:12.767 --> 07:15.233
Are you just now
realizing that?

07:15.233 --> 07:17.200
- Well, no, 'cause she was
my friend last season.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.200
- Gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you a lot.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.367

though, right?

07:20.367 --> 07:21.633

we were really close,

07:22.767 --> 07:24.333

07:40.100 --> 07:42.066

wireless right now?

07:42.066 --> 07:43.266
- I don't think so.

07:43.266 --> 07:45.000
- I was gonna try
to Google "mime face"

07:45.000 --> 07:46.133
so I had something
to go off of.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.500
I mean, I know in my head,

that clown makeup.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.133
- Start plating, because
I'm gonna start clearing.

- I like it, I like it,
I'm going.

gonna be up here in 20 minutes,

is all protein too.

09:36.667 --> 09:41.734
- When's the fireworks
happening?

09:41.734 --> 09:44.633
- Kate, Kate,
we're all set here.

- No, it looks f---ing stupid.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.433

10:15.133 --> 10:15.467

10:17.066 --> 10:18.633

that past lives existed

10:18.633 --> 10:20.633

at one point was named Tim?

10:20.633 --> 10:22.266

10:22.266 --> 10:24.066

anything, because that's funny.

- You did well.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.133

10:39.133 --> 10:41.000
- It was great, but it was
a little on the big side.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.333

on honey bread.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.133
- What is mine?

10:52.133 --> 10:53.600
- Yours is goat cheese
with honey.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
- That's not bad.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.767

a struggle for the season,

11:03.633 --> 11:09.033
but I'm leaving a better chef
than I was when I came.

11:09.033 --> 11:10.700
- Okay, Baker, get your hat on.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.500
There's gonna be fireworks
as soon as they get up here.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.667
Then we're gonna spray
each other with champagne,

11:14.667 --> 11:16.300
so we need to get
the goggles out.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.166
- You, my good man,
are appropriately dressed.

11:19.166 --> 11:22.033
- F--- it.

11:22.033 --> 11:24.667

gonna want to see this.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.000
Okay, so if you
haven't noticed,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.166
we have a kind of
a circus theme tonight,

11:32.166 --> 11:34.567

on the next level.

here for you.

another surprise.

in a champagne fight before?

my first one.

involved too.

have suction.

16:54.767 --> 16:56.633
I'm excited for drop-off,

16:56.633 --> 17:00.300
and then more excited
the following blowout.

17:00.300 --> 17:01.667
- I know.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.400
- Party till the sun comes up.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.500
- [singing]

17:05.500 --> 17:10.133
♪ These are soft-scrambled ♪

17:10.133 --> 17:13.133
- Of course Jen
is late for service.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.000
I guess it keeps
with the theme of the season

17:15.000 --> 17:16.300
I'll just keep working alone.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.667
'Twas the day
before we left the boat,

17:19.667 --> 17:22.166
and all through the yacht,

17:22.166 --> 17:25.033
not a crew member was stirring.

17:25.033 --> 17:27.200
Working, they were not.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.400
As dreams of charter tips
danced through their heads...

17:31.400 --> 17:33.033
- [laughing]

17:33.033 --> 17:35.467
- Kate served the guests
with laundry and made beds.

17:35.467 --> 17:36.467
- [laughs]

17:36.467 --> 17:37.600
That was good.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.400
[alarm buzzing]

17:41.333 --> 17:42.734
- That's what's happened
with this one.

17:42.734 --> 17:44.200
You say things
that aren't true,

17:44.200 --> 17:45.266
and you don't allow me
to speak.

17:45.266 --> 17:46.266
I'm just saying, this one--

17:46.266 --> 17:48.033
- Stop calling me "this one."

17:48.033 --> 17:49.667
You've been working with me
for six weeks--Brianna.

17:49.667 --> 17:50.700
- Don't interrupt me,
don't interrupt me.

17:58.233 --> 17:58.600
- Pulling up the anchor

17:58.600 --> 17:59.066
- Pulling up the anchor
for the last time.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.467
- Let's get it done.

18:05.767 --> 18:07.433
- Can I get
a chocolate milkshake?

18:07.433 --> 18:09.633
- Yes.
- Awesome.

18:09.633 --> 18:11.567
- Anchor's in the pocket
for the last time.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.066
- Nice job, guys.

18:13.066 --> 18:14.200
- That's it.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.567
- It's been
a long season, bro.

18:15.567 --> 18:17.066
- Smart-ass.

18:23.633 --> 18:24.633
Season's done.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.233
- I'm sad.

18:26.233 --> 18:28.166
We were just, like,
getting in the groove.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.734
- Yeah.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.200
I might be macho dude,

18:32.200 --> 18:35.100
big arms, good hairline,
chiseled jaw.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.700
But I'm actually
kind of chicken-sh--

18:37.700 --> 18:39.233
when it comes
to breaking up with girls.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.200
- We were just
getting so good.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.400
- So good.
- Now we have to leave.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.000
- Can we get everybody
in position?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.200
- Ready on the bow.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.533
- Ready on the stern?

18:47.533 --> 18:50.500
- Ready on the stern.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.400
About 30 feet on the port side.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.400
- We're in the wing station.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.000
- This is the last one, Nico.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
No pressure.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.233
All right, pull up.

19:03.233 --> 19:04.533
- How we doing
back there, Kyle?

19:04.533 --> 19:06.133
Do I need
to come forward more?

19:06.133 --> 19:08.133
- You're all good right now.

19:08.133 --> 19:10.600
- Park it.
- Lock it off, lock it off.

19:10.600 --> 19:11.600
- Well done, everybody.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.066
Thank you so much.

19:13.066 --> 19:16.533
Shut them down
for the last time.

19:16.533 --> 19:18.200
- Ooh, that's tight.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.667
- This is it,
the last docking.

19:20.667 --> 19:23.333
I was so crazy
about being boatswain

19:23.333 --> 19:24.700
at the beginning
of the season,

19:24.700 --> 19:26.400
I took it emotionally
that I wasn't.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.033
And now at the end of it,

19:28.033 --> 19:32.000
I just want to be a team player
and do a good job.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.767
- You guys experience that?

19:33.767 --> 19:36.233
- Yep.
- It was a rush.

19:36.233 --> 19:38.233
- So hard to put
these new epaulets on.

19:38.233 --> 19:39.266
They're just so heavy.

19:39.266 --> 19:40.433
- The extra stripes?

19:40.433 --> 19:42.567
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know.

19:42.567 --> 19:45.367
- All that responsibility
is right here.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.433
- It's like,
"Hi, Bri, I'm right here."

19:47.433 --> 19:49.233
Can you tone it down
a little bit?

19:49.233 --> 19:51.100
You're being
a little bit obnoxious

19:51.100 --> 19:52.500
and disrespectful.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.100
- Yeah, I think we're good.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.166
- My beautiful bag
is packed up.

19:59.166 --> 20:03.000
- All crew, all crew,
on the aft deck ASAP.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.400
- On our way.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.133
- Loved it.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.300
- Everything was fantastic.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.300
Thank you so much.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.300
- Great meeting you.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.200
Thanks man, appreciate it.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.200
- Take care.
- You too.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.700
- You guys were the best,
seriously.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.467
- Great food, amazing.
- Thank you.

20:23.467 --> 20:25.467
- I got to DM you
for recipes.

20:25.467 --> 20:28.300
- Definitely.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.066
Yes!

20:30.066 --> 20:31.066
Thank you.

20:31.066 --> 20:32.567
F---ing thank you.

20:32.567 --> 20:35.300
- This was an incredible trip.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.133
Did not really expect it
to be this good,

20:38.133 --> 20:39.600
to be frank,
from the last trip.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.467
You know, WiFi is always
an issue with us.

20:42.467 --> 20:44.467
But you guys got us
good WiFi on land,

20:44.467 --> 20:45.734
so we made some good trades.

20:45.734 --> 20:47.467
My guests, they loved
every second of it.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.200
And Captain, I think
you're like a fine wine.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.633
You're getting better
with age.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.734
- Thank you.

20:53.734 --> 20:55.433
- Thank you very much
for everything.

20:55.433 --> 20:57.200
- Thank you, Timothy.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.600
- And here's a little tip
for you guys for your services.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.734
- Thank you.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.433
- I can't thank you guys
enough.

21:01.433 --> 21:02.433
Smile a little more, Kate.

21:02.433 --> 21:03.734
- It hurts.

21:03.734 --> 21:05.233
[laughter]

21:05.233 --> 21:07.233
- Seriously,
it was great seeing you guys.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.767
- Anybody on the boat
would like to mention

21:08.767 --> 21:11.166
that circus extravaganza,

21:11.166 --> 21:12.500
that would be cool.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.600
Or we could just
insult my facial expressions.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.100
That's good too.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.467
- Seriously, it was great
seeing you guys.

21:17.467 --> 21:18.467
Great meeting you all.

21:18.467 --> 21:20.500
Have a good day,
thanks again.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.066
- Thank you.

21:22.066 --> 21:23.333
- Let's go to work.

21:28.300 --> 21:31.333
- Bri and Jen, Bri and Jen,
meet me in the sky lounge,

21:31.333 --> 21:33.533
and bring a bottle
of champagne.

21:33.533 --> 21:36.367
- Yay.

21:36.367 --> 21:37.367
- Whoo!

21:37.367 --> 21:39.400
- Yay!

21:39.400 --> 21:40.533
- Okay, girls.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.767
Amazing job this season.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.066
Did you guys have fun?

21:44.066 --> 21:45.333
Did you ever want to quit?

21:45.333 --> 21:47.400
- There was maybe two times.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.667
For me, it was frustrating,

21:48.667 --> 21:50.467
because I felt
like I had two bosses.

21:50.467 --> 21:52.000
I feel like sometimes

21:52.000 --> 21:53.400
Bri didn't know
what Kate asked me to do,

21:53.400 --> 21:55.233
or Kate didn't know
what Bri asked me to do.

21:55.233 --> 21:56.734
- I know, but when you said it,

21:56.734 --> 21:58.533
I would say, "Okay, go with
whatever Kate said."

21:58.533 --> 22:00.200
- That's how I felt,
so don't deny how I felt.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.266
That was my opinion.

22:01.266 --> 22:02.667
What frustrated you?

22:02.667 --> 22:04.266
- Bri, you're
pretty easy-going,

22:04.266 --> 22:05.500
but there certainly
must have been things

22:05.500 --> 22:07.066
that annoyed the sh--
out of you.

22:07.066 --> 22:08.233
- Um...

22:08.233 --> 22:09.633
- We're just gonna be honest.

22:09.633 --> 22:11.567
You take a long time
to get ready.

22:11.567 --> 22:14.000
- Yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.133
- Actually, I would like
to counteract that,

22:16.133 --> 22:18.033
because you're both hypocrites.

22:18.033 --> 22:20.433
There were days were you would
pretend to do laundry.

22:20.433 --> 22:22.033
You were really
washing your hair.

22:22.033 --> 22:24.433
- Your breaks, you guys
were making phone calls.

22:24.433 --> 22:27.266
My breaks, I literally just
make more orders

22:27.266 --> 22:29.300
for more theme parties
for this boat.

22:29.300 --> 22:30.667
- You say things
that aren't true,

22:30.667 --> 22:32.667
and you always
don't allow me to speak.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.700
Because I feel like that's
what's happened with this one.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.100
No, I will check in with you.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.433
I'm just saying, this one--

22:38.433 --> 22:40.233
- Stop calling me "this one."

22:40.233 --> 22:43.266
You've been working with me
for six weeks--Brianna.

22:43.266 --> 22:45.433
Jen plays the victim
all the time.

22:45.433 --> 22:47.233
And you know my name.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.433
- You're being rude.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.533
- I am a good worker,

22:49.533 --> 22:51.133
and I'm gonna go work now.

22:51.133 --> 22:52.667
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to you

22:52.667 --> 22:54.433
speak to me the way
that you're speaking to me.

22:54.433 --> 22:56.200
- You better understand--
- I understand everything.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.400
- She said--
- I'm not talking to you.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.400
- It was not--

22:58.400 --> 23:00.066
- Don't interrupt me.

23:00.066 --> 23:01.333
Don't interrupt me,
don't interrupt me.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.600
- She complimented you.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.266
- You're acting
like a 3-year-old.

23:04.266 --> 23:05.600
"I can't hear you,
I can't hear you..."

23:05.600 --> 23:07.333
- That's how you talk
every day, Kate.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.333
- Why don't you go live
in your glass house on land?

23:09.333 --> 23:10.700
Because you're clearly
not a yachty.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.467
Bye.

23:12.467 --> 23:14.333
I don't know why I was
expecting us all to be able

23:14.333 --> 23:16.066
to sit down
and talk like adults.

23:16.066 --> 23:17.333
I did invite Jen
to the sky lounge.

23:17.333 --> 23:18.400
Good job, this season, Bri.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.467
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

23:19.467 --> 23:22.333
- F---.

23:22.333 --> 23:23.333
- Uh-huh.

23:25.667 --> 23:27.200
- I'm getting out right now.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.600
- Yeah, but I don't even
want to get ready.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.333
- I'm just trying to find
the right moment

23:30.333 --> 23:32.133
and tell her I'm actually
gonna go home.

23:32.133 --> 23:34.633
So obviously I really loved
hanging out with you, but...

23:40.100 --> 23:41.200
- F---.

23:46.567 --> 23:49.700
I'm not gonna let what one
chief stew thinks about me

23:49.700 --> 23:51.467
affect my future plans.

23:51.467 --> 23:54.200
But right now, I just want
to go home to my baby girl.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.467
I know she wants me
to come home too.

23:55.467 --> 23:56.734
What's up?

23:56.734 --> 23:58.333
- What's going on?
- Not much.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.700
- Attention, all crew.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.100
I need everybody
in the crew mess ASAP.

24:02.100 --> 24:06.100
- What's crack-a-lacking?

24:06.100 --> 24:09.033
- Hello.
- Howdy-howdy.

24:09.033 --> 24:10.567
- Last one.

24:10.567 --> 24:12.233
I think this charter
went pretty well.

24:12.233 --> 24:15.200
That firework display
was cool.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.667
The season overall,

24:16.667 --> 24:19.100
this past charter, Matt,
I thought was your best.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.266
- Thanks.

24:20.266 --> 24:22.200
- You and Kate together.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.066
Wish we'd have
done that earlier.

24:24.066 --> 24:25.533
- Yeah.
- You guys nailed it.

24:25.533 --> 24:27.133
- Did a lot
of brainstorming together.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.000
Worked out really well.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.767
- I think this season was
a learning experience

24:30.767 --> 24:32.100
for a lot of people.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.233
A lot of people
did learn a lot,

24:34.233 --> 24:40.266
and then some of you...
still need to learn a lot.

24:40.266 --> 24:43.533
Nico, I think you did
an admirable job this season.

24:43.533 --> 24:47.266
You stayed on top of things,
had good progression.

24:47.266 --> 24:48.533
Well done.

24:48.533 --> 24:49.734
- Thank you.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.500
- It's yours.

24:56.633 --> 24:58.133
Open it up.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.700
[applause]

25:04.700 --> 25:06.533
- No!
- Yeah!

25:06.533 --> 25:07.633
[applause]

25:07.633 --> 25:08.633
- Neecky, Neecky.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.433
- Thank you.

25:10.433 --> 25:12.433
I've been struggling
for the last few months.

25:12.433 --> 25:14.433
And Captain, he's become
almost like a father figure.

25:14.433 --> 25:16.133
So getting this promotion
means a lot to me.

25:16.133 --> 25:17.667
- Well done, well earned.

25:17.667 --> 25:20.266
No more money,
you just got the stripes.

25:20.266 --> 25:21.567
- It's okay.

25:21.567 --> 25:22.767
- I'm very proud of Nico.

25:22.767 --> 25:24.300
He worked hard.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.166
He showed me
some stick-to-itiveness

25:26.166 --> 25:27.667
and perseverance,

25:27.667 --> 25:30.233
and I can appreciate
all of those good qualities.

25:30.233 --> 25:34.500
That being said,
this particular charter...

25:34.500 --> 25:35.533
30 grand.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.100
- F--- me.
- Yeah, man.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.700
- Oh, my god,
that's a lot of money.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.200
- Holla-holla-holla.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
- We set a new record.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.467
$2,720 per person.

25:44.467 --> 25:46.467
- Holy sh--.

25:46.467 --> 25:48.600
- Yeah, that's a lot of money.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.133
- Nice.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.467
- Good job this season, Nico,
thank you.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.467
Bruno, go buy yourself
some Band-Aids.

25:54.467 --> 25:55.600
- Yes, sir.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.467
$30,000 is so good.

25:57.467 --> 25:59.066
- Cheers, Cap.

25:59.066 --> 26:01.066
- This is the best way
to finish the season.

26:01.066 --> 26:02.266
- Thank you.

26:02.266 --> 26:04.033
- Nice job, Kate.
- Thank you.

26:04.033 --> 26:06.200
- As usual.
- Thank you.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.467
- I think everybody knows
how I want to finish up.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.066
You all know
what you have to do.

26:10.066 --> 26:11.066
You have your tasks.

26:11.066 --> 26:12.400
Let's just get it done.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.333
You guys will go out tonight,
one last hurrah.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.333
Okay?

26:16.333 --> 26:17.433
Well done.

26:17.433 --> 26:19.066
- Thank you, Cap.
- Yay!

26:19.066 --> 26:21.767
- I'm so happy.

26:21.767 --> 26:23.200
- Goodness gracious.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.600
- I have an idea tonight.

26:24.600 --> 26:25.767
- Ooh, let's hear it.

26:25.767 --> 26:27.500
- There is a sunset happening,

26:27.500 --> 26:29.066
and it'd be really nice
to go look at it

26:29.066 --> 26:30.500
up at the top of that fort.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.367
- Yeah.
- I love it!

26:32.367 --> 26:34.700
- And bringing your favorite:
champagne.

26:40.734 --> 26:43.567
- Ow!
- Let's do this.

26:43.567 --> 26:46.767
- Even with a broken leg,
I'm gonna go and hike.

26:46.767 --> 26:48.233
- Go!

26:48.233 --> 26:51.066
- Go, go, go, go, go!

26:51.066 --> 26:53.200
- All right, guys,
cheers to six weeks

26:53.200 --> 26:54.700
of spectacularness.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.233
- Whoo!
- Pour me, pour me.

26:57.233 --> 26:59.233
- Bottoms up.
- Cheers, guys.

26:59.233 --> 27:03.266
- Cheers to
a spectacular season.

27:03.266 --> 27:04.467
- This is nice.

27:22.133 --> 27:23.266
- Ready to roll back?

27:23.266 --> 27:25.100
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

27:32.633 --> 27:34.467
- I'm just gonna get my--
- Huh?

27:34.467 --> 27:36.266
- I'm just gonna get
my stuff out of there

27:36.266 --> 27:37.600
and get ready in a guest--

27:37.600 --> 27:39.400
- I'm getting out
right now.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.000
- Yeah, but I don't even want
to get ready in there.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.767
Nico and I,
we had planned something fun

27:42.767 --> 27:44.633
after this charter season,

27:44.633 --> 27:47.567
but since the hotel,
he's been a bit cold to me.

27:47.567 --> 27:49.400
So I'm not sure
what's going on.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.700
- 'Sup, dudes.

27:59.700 --> 28:02.233
[cheering]

28:02.233 --> 28:03.667
- Holy sh--.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.033
You look really hot.

28:05.033 --> 28:06.500
- [laughing]

28:06.500 --> 28:08.033
That's a wrap.

28:08.033 --> 28:10.100
- Rolling?
- Let's get out of here.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.133
- Aw, it's our last walk
down the dock.

28:12.133 --> 28:13.166
- Ooh!

28:13.166 --> 28:15.266
[laughter]

28:19.700 --> 28:21.400
- All righty.

28:24.533 --> 28:27.333
- Well, this is nice.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.200
- Whoo.
- Yah, mon.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.033
- Would you like
to order something to drink?

28:31.033 --> 28:33.000
- Raise your hand if you want
an espresso martini.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.433
- One, two, three, four, five.

28:34.433 --> 28:35.600
- This is amazing.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.066
- Isn't it funny
that the primary

28:38.066 --> 28:39.667
tipped us 30 grand,

28:39.667 --> 28:43.467
and I smashed him in the face
with shaving foam?

28:43.467 --> 28:47.166
I hit him so hard,
his safety goggles went up.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.333
- That was a great way
to go out,

28:49.333 --> 28:51.033
record-setting tip.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.333
- Thank you so much.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.467
- Great job, everyone
this season.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.266
Thanks for coming out.

28:56.266 --> 28:57.667
- Come back now, y'all hear?

28:57.667 --> 28:59.667
- This is the happy-tizer.

28:59.667 --> 29:01.667
- All right, happy-tizer.

29:01.667 --> 29:04.600
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.166
- It's really good--oy.

29:07.166 --> 29:09.467
I kind of wanted some.

29:09.467 --> 29:11.166
- Good?
- Yeah, good.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.467
- I just don't really eat--

29:12.467 --> 29:14.300
- I know, it's just
kind of random sh--.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.333
I'm just putting it
into my mouth.

29:16.333 --> 29:17.700
- I know what I need to do,

29:17.700 --> 29:19.300
but the anticipation
is killing me,

29:19.300 --> 29:20.567
and it doesn't make it
any easier.

29:20.567 --> 29:22.500
- I appreciate
the presentation.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.467
- I was wondering if I could
take Bri and jump off.

29:24.467 --> 29:26.767
I just want to talk with her
for two minutes.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.066
- I'll be right back.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.300
- All right, Bri,
you come back.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.500
Nico's gonna talk
about the weather

29:30.500 --> 29:32.367
or some sh--.

29:32.367 --> 29:34.333
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

29:34.333 --> 29:36.033
- Okay.

29:36.033 --> 29:38.633
- So obviously I really
loved hanging out with you.

29:38.633 --> 29:40.433
I know we planned
on staying here,

29:40.433 --> 29:43.367
but I just think
that I need to go home.

29:50.166 --> 29:50.400
- I think that

29:50.400 --> 29:52.500
- I think that
I need to go home.

29:55.667 --> 29:57.000
- Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.233
I don't really want to talk

29:58.233 --> 30:01.266
about what's going on
with my family.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.734
- I understand.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.367
- And it's obviously
affecting me a lot.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.367
- I understand.

30:05.367 --> 30:06.734
- And I hope you do,

30:06.734 --> 30:08.600
because it has nothing
to do with you personally.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.200
- I understand that, I do.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.133
You're gonna get home
as soon as you can

30:12.133 --> 30:13.233
to take care of your family.

30:13.233 --> 30:15.000
That's the right thing to do.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.467
- I don't want you thinking
I'm just bailing out on you.

30:16.467 --> 30:20.133
- Oh, my gosh, Nico, no way.

30:20.133 --> 30:22.467
I'm more concerned about you
and your family.

30:22.467 --> 30:24.533
I would be lying if I didn't
say I was disappointed.

30:24.533 --> 30:25.667
I like Nico.

30:25.667 --> 30:27.400
I'm definitely bummed we're not

30:27.400 --> 30:29.000
gonna get a chance
to hang out in St. Martin

30:29.000 --> 30:31.133
and see if it was more
than a boat fling.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.166
But I get it, I get it.

30:32.166 --> 30:33.767
Family comes first.

30:33.767 --> 30:35.700
It's okay.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.266
Thank you for telling me.

30:37.266 --> 30:38.700
- F---ing sh--.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.433
- Ugh, it still hurts.

30:40.433 --> 30:42.033
- It's a virgin mojito.

30:42.033 --> 30:43.233
- Virgin, really?
- It is.

30:43.233 --> 30:44.767
- So it's just minty?

30:44.767 --> 30:47.033
- I'm not drinking much
these days.

30:47.033 --> 30:49.100
- I'm proud of myself
for cutting back on the booze.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.567
I feel refreshed,
I feel clear-headed,

30:51.567 --> 30:54.166
I feel like my liver
is actually recovering.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.100
And leaving the season
not tired and not drunk

30:57.100 --> 30:58.166
is a great feeling.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.133
I'm full; I tap out.

31:00.133 --> 31:03.166
- Where'd you guys go?

31:03.166 --> 31:04.667
- Oh?

31:04.667 --> 31:06.133
- Did he propose?

31:06.133 --> 31:07.633
- No.
- Do you want to stay here?

31:07.633 --> 31:09.033
- Where is he?
Okay, he's there.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.300
Just between you and I,

31:10.300 --> 31:12.266
so we had that couple days
planned after this

31:12.266 --> 31:13.600
to have fun and stuff.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.600
So he was just pulling me
aside to tell me

31:15.600 --> 31:19.600
he has to go home
as soon as possible.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.333
I knew he was acting weird,

31:21.333 --> 31:22.600
but I didn't think
he would ditch me

31:22.600 --> 31:25.033
a day before we planned
on hanging out.

31:25.033 --> 31:27.734
- It's gonna be a painful
journey for a while.

31:27.734 --> 31:29.700
- Yeah.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.600
Let's just dance
around the fire.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.133
- Go dance, Kyle, go dance.

31:33.133 --> 31:34.700
- We have music.

31:34.700 --> 31:37.400
- This is our last night!
- This is all we need, yeah.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.400
[dance music]

31:40.400 --> 31:42.600
♪ ♪

31:42.600 --> 31:43.667
- Ow!

31:43.667 --> 31:45.667
[cheering]

31:45.667 --> 31:48.100
[laughter]

31:52.266 --> 31:54.066
- I think that I would regret

31:54.066 --> 31:58.200
if I didn't approach Kate
to try and gain some closure

31:58.200 --> 31:59.500
on what went wrong.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.767
What did I do to deserve
to be treated like this

32:02.767 --> 32:04.066
this entire season?

32:04.066 --> 32:07.033
I just wanna
try to clear the air.

32:07.033 --> 32:10.333
I just feel like
I could never speak my mind.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.367
And I just want you to know,
like, I don't speak--

32:12.367 --> 32:14.767
- It's not that
I don't want to hear you talk.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.100
I love hearing you talk.
I think you're hilarious.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.767
It's that I don't have time.
It's not personal.

32:20.767 --> 32:23.767
It's almost like it makes you
feel better to cut others down.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.734
This does not feel good
to me right now.

32:25.734 --> 32:27.633
- The charter season is over,

32:27.633 --> 32:30.567
so I don't understand why Jen
is saying these things to me.

32:30.567 --> 32:32.767
And more importantly,
I just don't care.

32:32.767 --> 32:34.367
- As a manager, I think--

32:34.367 --> 32:36.734
- Are you giving me
managerial advice right now?

32:36.734 --> 32:38.333
- No, I'm not doing anything.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.533
- I don't know
what you're doing.

32:39.533 --> 32:41.066
You are not doing anything.

32:41.066 --> 32:43.266
I wish you could have
spent less time

32:43.266 --> 32:45.066
concerned about me and my--

32:45.066 --> 32:46.100
- I wasn't that concerned
about it.

32:46.100 --> 32:47.133
- I would like--

32:47.133 --> 32:48.266
- See, you're getting ugly now.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.400
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.266
- Thank you, Jen, thank you.

32:51.266 --> 32:52.633
- Of course Kate shuts me down,

32:52.633 --> 32:55.500
but hopefully,
six months down the road,

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
maybe she'll have
this little voice of reason

32:57.500 --> 32:59.633
that says, "Maybe I was
a little bit hard

32:59.633 --> 33:00.734
on Jen this season."

33:02.066 --> 33:03.600
Sorry for invading your space.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.767
- Thank you for coming out.

33:04.767 --> 33:06.333
- I get it,
I'll leave you alone.

33:10.667 --> 33:12.700
- Let's go back
to the boat, motherf---ers.

33:25.166 --> 33:27.000
- Fine, don't worry about it.
- I know.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.233
- Yay.
- Last night, guys.

33:31.233 --> 33:34.300
- Good night, guys.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.667
- Oh, my gosh, season's over.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.567
- Good morning.
- 'Sup, buddy?

33:56.567 --> 33:58.567
- What you doing?
- Just thinking?

33:58.567 --> 34:00.467
- It's sad, huh?

34:00.467 --> 34:02.600
Definitely won't forget
working with you, buddy.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.567
You were amazing.

34:03.567 --> 34:04.600
You were always there.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.166
You gave 120%.

34:06.166 --> 34:08.066
It was not easy for you,
I know that.

34:08.066 --> 34:10.567
This season was about
me growing as well,

34:10.567 --> 34:12.433
and you helped me do that,

34:12.433 --> 34:15.166
and emotionally supported me.

34:15.166 --> 34:16.533
Come on.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.433
- So, Cap, I wouldn't say
I wasn't upset

34:22.433 --> 34:23.700
that I wasn't the first call,

34:23.700 --> 34:25.166
but thank you
for calling me anyway.

34:25.166 --> 34:26.467
It was awesome.

34:26.467 --> 34:27.734
Pretty much
like all my relationships:

34:27.734 --> 34:28.734
short and sweet.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.333
- You're half right.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.533
- Thank you so much.

34:31.533 --> 34:33.200
- Take it easy, pal.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.333
- Kate.
- Bye.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.000
- Give me some love, baby.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.600
It's a shame that me and Kate
are leaving on bad terms,

34:39.600 --> 34:41.300
but if she wants
to be like that,

34:41.300 --> 34:42.333
that's fine.

34:42.333 --> 34:43.700
I'm the better person,

34:43.700 --> 34:45.633
and I'll walk away
with a skip in my step.

34:45.633 --> 34:47.500
- You do you, yeah?
- Yeah, always.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.767
- Don't change
a f---ing thing.

34:48.767 --> 34:50.233
- You're awesome.
- Thanks, buddy.

34:50.233 --> 34:51.633
- Made some money this season.

34:51.633 --> 34:53.200
I'm looking forward now
to going home,

34:53.200 --> 34:56.433
having a nice,
crisp pint of cider

34:56.433 --> 34:57.500
and a nap.

34:57.500 --> 35:00.467
- Bye.
- Take it easy.

35:00.467 --> 35:02.700
- Peace.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.767
- Ex-roommate.
- Mm.

35:05.767 --> 35:07.233
- Safe trip home, okay?

35:07.233 --> 35:08.433
- Bye.

35:08.433 --> 35:10.066
- It was a pleasure
to work with you.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.500
- You as well,
you do great.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.233
And I think that if you want
to stay in yachting,

35:13.233 --> 35:15.367
you would have a great career
as a deckhand or a stew.

35:15.367 --> 35:18.100
I think that Bruno has a very
bright future in yachting.

35:18.100 --> 35:21.033
Except I think his path
is in the interior,

35:21.033 --> 35:22.233
because clearly he thinks

35:22.233 --> 35:24.200
he can do a better job
than I can.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.667
- Bruno.
- Captain.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.533
- About to leave, yeah.

35:27.533 --> 35:29.200
- Well, I hope
you enjoyed yourself.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.667
- I have one last question.
- Sure.

35:31.667 --> 35:35.266
- Would Captain mind...

35:35.266 --> 35:39.266
to give me
a recommendation letter?

35:39.266 --> 35:40.500
- Sure, I could do that.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.667
- Thanks, man,
I really thank you.

35:43.667 --> 35:45.233
It was a pleasure, Captain,
really.

35:45.233 --> 35:47.266
- I think you have a great
future in this business.

35:47.266 --> 35:49.533
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

35:49.533 --> 35:51.400
- I had a huge picture
for yachting,

35:51.400 --> 35:52.767
coming from cruise ships.

35:52.767 --> 35:54.500
And I'm so happy
that I did it,

35:54.500 --> 35:56.467
and I just found
this new passion.

35:56.467 --> 35:58.667
So I'm gonna get
Captain Lee's letter,

35:58.667 --> 36:01.333
and I'm gonna show it to
every single boat and marina,

36:01.333 --> 36:04.200
and I'm gonna be
the best yachty ever

36:04.200 --> 36:05.767
in the yachting industry.

36:05.767 --> 36:11.033
Captain Lee is gonna hear
my name, big time.

36:11.033 --> 36:12.166
- What are your plans?

36:12.166 --> 36:13.633
- I'm going back to Chicago.

36:13.633 --> 36:15.533
Tell Melissa
that I f---ed up

36:15.533 --> 36:17.300
and that I'm an asshole.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.300
- Maybe see you next year.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.500
- I don't know.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.367
- If I could have done anything
differently this season,

36:22.367 --> 36:24.433
it probably would have been
focus more on my food

36:24.433 --> 36:26.300
and less on what's happening
back home.

36:26.300 --> 36:27.567
Thank you so much.

36:27.567 --> 36:30.166
- It was such a pleasure
to work with you.

36:30.166 --> 36:32.767
My only bummer is that we
got into our groove

36:32.767 --> 36:34.400
so late in the season.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.133
I think that Matt's great,

36:36.133 --> 36:39.433
but I don't think being a yacht
charter chef is for him.

36:39.433 --> 36:40.633
He's too nice.

36:40.633 --> 36:43.166
Bye, safe travels,
keep in touch.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.000
- Captain Lee.
- Yes, sir.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.500
- I had a hell of a season,
thank you.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.600
- You know, sometimes you go
through a whole season,

36:48.600 --> 36:49.734
you don't find your groove.

36:49.734 --> 36:51.033
At least you found it.

36:51.033 --> 36:52.200
- Right.
- Take care of yourself.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.066
- Thank you so much.
- You bet, man.

36:54.066 --> 36:55.600
- I've been a little
inconsistent this season,

36:55.600 --> 36:57.000
and that's not acceptable.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.266
I need to update
my bag of tricks.

37:02.433 --> 37:04.033
- I know we had this whole--

37:04.033 --> 37:05.333
anyways, I want you to know,

37:05.333 --> 37:07.200
absolutely no hard feelings
about that.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.133
- Yeah, youse not a ho.

37:09.133 --> 37:11.033
- You're a f---ing idiot.

37:11.033 --> 37:12.734
- Whatever, whore!

37:12.734 --> 37:14.600
- No, you're not a whore.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.600
- I'm definitely
a much better deckhand now

37:16.600 --> 37:18.200
than when I started.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.300
I came on hoping
I could just get by

37:20.300 --> 37:21.567
as the lowly deckhand

37:21.567 --> 37:23.300
with not having
to do that much,

37:23.300 --> 37:24.734
and I ended up
having to step it up.

37:24.734 --> 37:27.066
So I'm really proud
of myself.

37:27.066 --> 37:30.166
Nico-Rico, Nico-Chico,
Cheeky-Neeky.

37:30.166 --> 37:32.700
But right now I got
a big stack of cash

37:32.700 --> 37:34.333
burning a whole
in my pocket,

37:34.333 --> 37:36.633
so I might stimulate
the economy a little bit.

37:36.633 --> 37:38.166
And who knows what
after that?

37:38.166 --> 37:39.567
See you soon, m'wah.

37:39.567 --> 37:41.300
My sister
from another mister.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.600
- [laughs]

37:49.500 --> 37:51.233
- Did you have fun?
- I did.

37:51.233 --> 37:53.500
- I know sometimes people say
things they don't mean,

37:53.500 --> 37:56.033
so I hope some of the things
that you said to me

37:56.033 --> 37:58.066
were just frustration.

38:04.400 --> 38:04.767
- I know sometimes people

38:04.767 --> 38:05.367
- I know sometimes people
say things they don't mean,

38:07.367 --> 38:09.066
so I hope some of the things
that you said me

38:09.066 --> 38:10.533
were just frustration.

38:10.533 --> 38:15.400
And I hope that you agree
that you were working with me.

38:15.400 --> 38:18.066
- Yeah, never doubted that
for a second.

38:18.066 --> 38:19.367
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:19.367 --> 38:20.734
- Well, keep in touch.

38:20.734 --> 38:22.100
I bet you're very excited
to go see Bella.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.233
- I am.

38:23.233 --> 38:25.367
I've learned a lot,
and yes,

38:25.367 --> 38:27.667
there's a lot that's not what
I expected it to be at all.

38:27.667 --> 38:30.367
But as difficult as it was,
what can I say?

38:30.367 --> 38:33.066
I like big boats,
and I cannot lie.

38:33.066 --> 38:35.333
- I know we've had
a crazy season,

38:35.333 --> 38:37.400
and it's been like this
and down and up.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.400
- Different people
see things differently.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.133
And different is good.

38:41.133 --> 38:42.333
The first thing
that I'm gonna do

38:42.333 --> 38:43.667
when I go home

38:43.667 --> 38:46.233
is obviously love my daughter
to pieces

38:46.233 --> 38:48.100
and give her hugs and kisses.

38:48.100 --> 38:50.667
I feel in my heart
that seeing her mother

38:50.667 --> 38:52.400
live out her dreams

38:52.400 --> 38:55.400
and not being afraid
of failure,

38:55.400 --> 38:58.166
I think that
is an invaluable lesson.

38:58.166 --> 38:59.400
- I'm like your cabana boy.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.700
- Just gonna take you with me.

39:02.700 --> 39:04.166
[line trilling]

39:04.166 --> 39:05.533
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

39:05.533 --> 39:07.367
- I'm just going to work.

39:07.367 --> 39:09.166
- I'm really sorry
for everything.

39:09.166 --> 39:13.433
I know these last few weeks
haven't been easy, but...

39:13.433 --> 39:16.166
- I'm excited to see you.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.300
- Melissa's one of those types
that, if it's done, it's done.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.133
And so it's gonna be hard,

39:20.133 --> 39:22.400
but I'm not gonna give up
until I win her heart back.

39:24.700 --> 39:28.567
- Definitely,
all right, I love you.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.166
- Did you take your epaulets?

39:30.166 --> 39:31.300
- I did.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.033
- That's cute.

39:33.033 --> 39:34.433
I had so much fun
working with you.

39:34.433 --> 39:37.200
- Me too,
I really did too.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.300
- You off?
- Yeah.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.200
- I'm glad you were
on the boat.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.734
- Yeah, me as well.

39:47.734 --> 39:49.066
Yeah, it was nice.

39:49.066 --> 39:50.600
It was nice
connecting with you

39:50.600 --> 39:52.533
and spending time with you.

39:52.533 --> 39:53.600
I enjoyed it.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.033
I f---ed up.

39:55.033 --> 39:56.467
I want to go back home,

39:56.467 --> 39:58.333
and I want to prove
that I'm not an asshole.

39:58.333 --> 40:01.700
I'm not a bad guy;
I'm human.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.433
- Bye, Nico.

40:03.433 --> 40:04.734
I'm sure I'll see you.

40:04.734 --> 40:06.700
I don't really ever have
regrets in life.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.600
- See you later.
- Bye.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.567
- Everything truly happens
for a reason.

40:10.567 --> 40:11.734
But it's kind of sad,

40:11.734 --> 40:14.000
because I think we both feel

40:14.000 --> 40:16.233
that it could have
been something great.

40:16.233 --> 40:17.633
But Nico has a lot
of healing to do,

40:17.633 --> 40:20.433
and I hope he just
takes the time to do that.

40:23.633 --> 40:25.467
- Nico, you did well this year.

40:25.467 --> 40:28.033
- Thank you,
trying to step it up a bit.

40:28.033 --> 40:29.567
- You did good.
- That means a lot.

40:29.567 --> 40:31.734
- I hope I get the chance
to work with you again,

40:31.734 --> 40:33.233
if you can put up with it
another year.

40:33.233 --> 40:34.367
- Mm, we'll see.

40:34.367 --> 40:35.767
[laughter]

40:35.767 --> 40:37.467
- Nico went through
a lot this season.

40:37.467 --> 40:40.367
And it's how you accept it
or don't

40:40.367 --> 40:42.767
that determines how you
come out the other side.

40:42.767 --> 40:45.367
I think Nico came out
the other side just fine.

40:45.367 --> 40:47.233
- You take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

40:47.233 --> 40:49.500
- It's really nice
working with Captain Lee.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.367
And this season, we really
strengthened our relationship.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.100
And I'm definitely
gonna miss him.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.433
We actually had
a good season,

40:55.433 --> 40:57.266
compared to last time.

40:57.266 --> 40:59.133
So it was good
to rekindle that.

40:59.133 --> 41:00.133
Very good.

41:00.133 --> 41:01.400
- Safe travels.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.600
- I think just being away
from my home

41:03.600 --> 41:06.133
has made me realize
how important it is

41:06.133 --> 41:08.066
to be around my family
and to be home.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.233
And I'm ready
to face my goals.

41:13.533 --> 41:14.533
- Hi.

41:14.533 --> 41:15.734
- Hello, beautiful.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.266
- How are you?
- I'm well.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.400
- How was your season?

41:18.400 --> 41:20.133
- It got better.

41:20.133 --> 41:21.533
It was not good at first.

41:21.533 --> 41:23.400
- Think you got another season
left in you?

41:23.400 --> 41:25.100
- I think it's too soon
to tell.

41:25.100 --> 41:26.100
- [laughs]

41:26.100 --> 41:27.133
- Who knows?

41:27.133 --> 41:28.367
- Be safe, sweetie.

41:28.367 --> 41:30.734
- All right, I will see you
in Florida.

41:30.734 --> 41:32.333
- Bye.
- Bye, Kate.

41:32.333 --> 41:33.767
- How, how about this?

41:33.767 --> 41:36.133
Next time I come back,
I will be a charter guest.

41:36.133 --> 41:37.734
- [laughs]

41:37.734 --> 41:40.500
- This was not an easy season,
especially for me.

41:40.500 --> 41:44.767
We had ups, downs,
training, fights, crying.

41:44.767 --> 41:46.300
But at the end of the day,

41:46.300 --> 41:49.166
I still feel very lucky
to have the opportunity.

41:49.166 --> 41:50.767
I always said I never wanted
to have a boring life,

41:50.767 --> 41:55.300
and yachting
makes sure of that.

41:55.300 --> 41:56.667
- [exhales]

41:56.667 --> 41:58.667
This season,
it started out bad.

41:58.667 --> 42:00.433
We had green crew.

42:00.433 --> 42:02.567
Jesus Christ,
f---ing idiots.

42:02.567 --> 42:04.033
- This isn't a martini.

42:04.033 --> 42:05.166
- Do you know
how to pour an ounce?

42:05.166 --> 42:06.266
- No.

42:06.266 --> 42:07.700
- We had damage to the boat.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.133
[loud bang]

42:09.133 --> 42:10.133
- God damn it!

42:10.133 --> 42:11.300
Damage to people.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.133
- Ugh!
- I need to go to the hospital.

42:13.133 --> 42:16.033
- But they did a good job
in spite of themselves.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.166
F---ing well done, everybody.

42:18.166 --> 42:19.633
We managed
to get through the season.

42:19.633 --> 42:22.600
Y'all need to get
your butts in the seats.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.000
30 grand.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.066
- Holla-holla-holla-holla.
- Yay!

42:26.066 --> 42:28.367
- I still have the best
damn job in the world.

42:35.066 --> 42:37.700
Three months after finishing
this season of "Below Deck,"

42:37.700 --> 42:41.567
Hurricane Maria
wreaked havoc on St. Martin,

42:41.567 --> 42:43.600
St. Barths, and Anguilla.

42:43.600 --> 42:47.200
And it's always meant so much
to us and "Below Deck,"

42:47.200 --> 42:49.700
because that's
where we lived,

42:49.700 --> 42:51.400
we worked, we filmed.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.467
And to have it
just disappear overnight,

42:54.467 --> 42:56.734
it's just devastating.

42:56.734 --> 42:58.667
Our hearts and thoughts
and prayers go out

42:58.667 --> 43:00.433
to everybody
that's been affected by it.

43:02.767 --> 43:05.333
