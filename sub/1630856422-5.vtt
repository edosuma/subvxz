WEBVTT

01:49.025 --> 01:50.235
Here she is, hon.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.821
Thanks for lettin' me stay close.

01:52.821 --> 01:57.408
Absolutely, just please don't tell anyone.

02:01.621 --> 02:02.747
Sign here.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.466
Be careful. It's hot.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.807
<i>The doctor says
we have to limit contact to 10 minutes.</i>

03:45.391 --> 03:50.021
He's still in withdrawal,
so go easy on him, okay?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.022
Alright.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.858
Did you know Clark from before?

03:55.777 --> 03:56.986
Otis?

03:57.403 --> 03:58.738
Did you know him?

03:59.322 --> 04:03.618
No. I knew about Tsalal,
but I didn't know the men there.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.037
What did he want with you?

04:06.663 --> 04:09.999
He was asking how I survived my injuries.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.044
And how did you?

04:13.044 --> 04:17.465
Fuck, man.
Does it really look to you like I did?

04:19.717 --> 04:23.054
Alright. Where is Clark now?

04:23.721 --> 04:24.847
I don't know.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.724
You said...

04:27.725 --> 04:29.269
you said that he was...

04:30.228 --> 04:33.231
he was goin' back to the Night Country.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.359
- I did?
- Yeah, at the dredge.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.695
- What did that mean?
- I don't know.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.573
- He was crazy as shit, man.
- Alright, what else did he say?

04:44.701 --> 04:47.370
-"She's awake."
-"She's awake."

04:48.454 --> 04:49.831
Said that a bunch of times.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.168
He said, "I have to hide.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.546
She's out there."

04:56.546 --> 04:59.007
Creepy motherfucker.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.634
Alright.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.012
Let's talk about back then.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.889
What happened on the day of your injuries?

05:08.349 --> 05:11.894
Shit was 30 years ago.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.229
What does it matter?

05:13.229 --> 05:16.774
It matters. Tell me.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.653
There was a cave-in.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.532
Men died trapped in the ice.

05:26.492 --> 05:30.997
We ran out for help,
but there was a blizzard.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.916
I heard...

05:39.088 --> 05:40.214
Otis?

05:42.925 --> 05:44.260
...somethin'

05:45.762 --> 05:48.097
screaming, howling.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.934
The other men started following the sound.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.688
I tried to go after them and then,

05:56.898 --> 05:58.024
nothin'.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.236
- Nothin'. What does that mean?
- I woke up in the hospital.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.656
My eyes were burned,
my ears, all gone to shit.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.119
Alright.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.500
Alright.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.253
So...

06:21.214 --> 06:24.675
this the cave system you were mapping?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.846
Can you point to where the entrance is?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.433
It's right at the end of Bear Creek.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.645
Here, but you can't go on your own.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.524
The caves collapse.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.652
That ice is like crawling on thin glass.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.696
Yeah, well, you're gonna take us there.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.407
I can't like this.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.785
You're gonna be better in a few days.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.578
That's not what I'm saying.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.956
You can help me get well.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.796
I can't get you heroin, you know that.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.549
Your time's up.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.110
Found the entrance.
You sure you're up for this?

07:24.944 --> 07:25.862
Yeah.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.623
You wanna talk about it?

07:39.458 --> 07:40.376
No.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.336
Alright.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.058
What's this?

07:56.058 --> 07:57.685
That's your bag.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.562
Please don't come back tonight.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.483
- No. Hold, Kayla, you can't--
- Please, just go.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.574
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Kayla?

08:13.659 --> 08:17.371
You can't just kick me out, Kayla.
This is my fuckin' family too!

08:20.583 --> 08:23.502
<i>So this cave is on Silver Sky property?</i>

08:24.045 --> 08:26.589
Yeah. They own the entire region.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.675
How's Leah?

08:31.427 --> 08:32.595
She's got a girlfriend.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.100
So? I've had a bunch of those.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.394
Yeah, I guess.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.606
Girlfriend thing is okay.
It's just

08:45.316 --> 08:50.029
Lee's turned into one of these
crazy radicals

08:50.029 --> 08:52.490
splashin' that black paint
all over the place.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.409
They're not crazy.
It's the fucking water.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.037
- I know, alright? I know.
- It's poisoning people.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.382
Is this it?

09:53.968 --> 09:57.805
It looks like somebody
blew the entryway shut.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.684
Because of course they fuckin' did.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.811
- Fuck!
- Hey.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.438
Fuck this shit!

10:32.840 --> 10:35.384
<i>There is no love</i>

10:38.220 --> 10:41.349
None lost, none found

10:43.642 --> 10:46.979
There is no God

10:49.106 --> 10:51.984
No hallowed ground

10:54.570 --> 11:01.160
You are forever bound to lose

11:01.160 --> 11:05.331
So what's the use?

11:07.750 --> 11:11.337
We were here before,
gonna stay when you're gone!

11:11.337 --> 11:13.506
We were here before, gonna stay...

11:13.506 --> 11:16.425
<i>There is no king</i>

11:16.425 --> 11:18.969
...gonna stay when you're gone!

11:18.969 --> 11:22.098
<i>He won't be crowned</i>

11:22.098 --> 11:24.475
We were here before,
gonna stay when you're gone!

11:24.475 --> 11:27.478
<i>There is no star</i>

11:29.855 --> 11:32.983
<i>She's fallin' down</i>

11:35.444 --> 11:39.824
<i>You are forever bound</i>

11:39.824 --> 11:42.993
Land back, water back!

11:42.993 --> 11:46.038
<i>So what's the use</i>

11:46.038 --> 11:53.003
We were here before,
gonna stay when you're gone!

11:53.003 --> 11:54.463
We were here before--

11:54.463 --> 11:58.050
<i>There is no place</i>

12:00.469 --> 12:02.680
<i>To get unwound</i>

12:05.391 --> 12:08.936
<i>You will not sing</i>

12:10.980 --> 12:13.858
<i>You lost your sound</i>

12:16.318 --> 12:20.906
<i>You are forever bound</i>

12:20.906 --> 12:23.033
<i>To lose</i>

12:23.033 --> 12:25.161
<i>So what's</i>

12:25.161 --> 12:27.246
- Land back, water back!
<i>- The use?</i>

13:01.822 --> 13:02.615
Hello.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.659
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Hey.</i>

13:06.285 --> 13:07.203
Hey,

13:08.996 --> 13:10.539
what are you doin'?

13:11.415 --> 13:14.376
Just doin' some work on my truck.
What's goin' on?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.464
Kayla,

13:19.507 --> 13:22.468
she thinks we need a little time apart.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.470
And

13:25.679 --> 13:29.433
I was wondering,
if it's not too much trouble,

13:31.018 --> 13:33.896
could I crash with you?

13:33.896 --> 13:37.107
Oh, yeah.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.819
It ain't exactly the Radisson,
but come on over.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.656
<i>Okay, great.</i>

13:44.865 --> 13:47.743
Probably, like, five minutes away.

13:47.743 --> 13:48.953
<i>Okay.</i>

13:50.538 --> 13:51.455
Okay.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.633
Land back, water back!

14:09.598 --> 14:11.350
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Move! Let him go!

14:11.809 --> 14:14.979
Let him go now!
Move back! Get down! Move!

14:14.979 --> 14:17.147
Move! Hey, no! Break it up!

14:35.749 --> 14:39.169
Land back, water back!
Land back, water back!

14:41.714 --> 14:43.757
Get over here, you fuckin' bitch!

14:45.301 --> 14:47.636
Get off of me, you fuckin' pig!

14:51.432 --> 14:52.516
Sheri!

14:54.768 --> 14:56.812
Sheri! Sheri!

14:58.981 --> 15:00.232
Stay back!

15:00.232 --> 15:02.651
Hey! She's a fucking kid!

15:03.569 --> 15:05.988
- You okay?
- Fuck the police!

15:06.488 --> 15:07.990
What the fuck, Navarro?

15:17.124 --> 15:19.918
<i>Come on, Ted, it was a protest.</i>

15:19.918 --> 15:21.003
What do you want from me?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.255
<i>Kate's fuckin' furious
and wants answers.</i>

15:23.255 --> 15:24.590
Well, why me?

15:25.799 --> 15:28.177
It's not even our jurisdiction.
It's the Troopers' job.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.595
<i>She wants you there.</i>

15:29.595 --> 15:31.972
<i>You're the Chief of Police,
for Christ's sakes.</i>

15:32.514 --> 15:33.891
Fine. I'll go to her office.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.434
<i>- I'll see you there.</i>
- Wait.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.936
You're gonna be there?

15:37.936 --> 15:39.813
What the fuck is goin' on, Ted?

15:39.813 --> 15:41.565
<i>Just fuckin' be there.</i>

15:42.316 --> 15:43.233
Fine.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.070
Navarro.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.280
<i>Well, I got some shit news for you.</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:50.574
Really?

15:51.909 --> 15:53.035
'Cause I fuckin' will.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.247
Alright.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.879
What'd she say?

16:04.755 --> 16:05.881
How's your head?

16:06.465 --> 16:08.384
Fine. Stopped bleeding.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.929
That's a shame.
Put on your seatbelt.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.391
What the fuck were you doing there?

16:16.141 --> 16:17.851
What the fuck were you doing there?

16:18.852 --> 16:20.270
I mean, whose side are you on?

16:22.815 --> 16:26.527
Liz, I get it, but you know the shit
that's happening in this town.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.112
What were you thinking?

16:28.112 --> 16:31.031
Jesus Christ, I'm actually feelin'
for Danvers right now.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.369
Just take me home.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.787
You're not going home.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.081
What are you talking about?

16:39.957 --> 16:41.709
She wants me to take you in.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.211
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:46.672 --> 16:49.591
Fucking pigs. All of you.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.096
- Hey.
- Hey, I was looking for you.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.473
Did you know that Leah
was goin' to that protest?

16:56.473 --> 16:58.517
- No, no, no. Is she okay?
- 'Cause if you're covering for her--

16:58.517 --> 17:00.102
- No, no, I'm not, I'm not--
- Swear to God.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.563
I'm not in the house.
Kayla kicked me out.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.609
Wow, that's...

17:09.194 --> 17:10.988
that's hard.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.240
You need a place to stay or?

17:13.240 --> 17:18.996
No. No, movin' in with you would basically
fast track me to a divorce, so.

17:22.332 --> 17:27.713
It's not all bad, though.
Here, take a look at this.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.007
What's this?

17:30.007 --> 17:32.593
That is the thing you've been lookin' for.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.802
Liz?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.638
Don't look.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.599
- Nope.
- What's goin' on?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.476
- Coop?
- Yeah?

17:40.476 --> 17:42.478
- Book me, will you?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.189
- Seriously?
- Hey, what am I lookin' at?

17:47.191 --> 17:50.068
The LLC that paid the grants
that fund the station.

17:50.068 --> 17:52.237
- Yeah.
- I followed their tax returns,

17:52.237 --> 17:54.948
and they trace back to Tuttle United.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.408
You remember them?

17:57.159 --> 18:00.370
Yeah, the palm oil,
video games, cruise lines.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.081
Yeah, and four deals
in Canada and two in China

18:03.081 --> 18:06.877
with Norbank Securities,
which is a founding partner of...

18:13.801 --> 18:15.010
Silver Sky Mining.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.724
This is evidence.

18:21.558 --> 18:26.355
That means, the mine bankrolls Tsalal,

18:26.355 --> 18:30.067
and then Tsalal pushes out
bogus pollution numbers for 'em.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.902
It's definitely possible.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.867
Hey, sorry about the divorce.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.495
- It's not a divorce, Chief.
- Whatever.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.549
You know I hate Pepsi, Prior.

18:54.132 --> 18:57.719
Yeah, well, the machine was out
of Mountain Dew, so.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.720
Fine.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.394
You okay?

19:06.520 --> 19:07.437
Yeah.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.483
Thanks.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.110
What about Sheri?

19:13.110 --> 19:15.362
- She okay?
- Fuck Sheri.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.823
Fuck Sheri? Why?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.199
Heard you got kicked out.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.577
You knew?

19:21.577 --> 19:23.787
She couldn't stop crying, Prior.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.290
You're an asshole.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.888
Ya know, she told me about
when she first fell in love with you.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.390
She saw you play.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.435
Senior year? Finals?

19:46.435 --> 19:48.645
No, this game you lost.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.773
You fell on your ass.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.734
- And then--
- Huey Larson scored?

19:55.527 --> 19:58.822
She said that everyone
gave you so much shit

19:58.822 --> 20:02.826
and you just had this stupid,
idiot smile on your face.

20:11.001 --> 20:14.171
And then she found out
that Huey's dad had had a stroke.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.384
You fell on purpose, didn't you?

20:21.887 --> 20:22.804
No.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.017
She just misses that guy, Prior.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.189
Don't let Liz ruin that guy, okay?

20:37.861 --> 20:39.988
She's not good with people
she cares about.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.870
You're not really keepin'
her in there, are you?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.916
She needs to get how vulnerable
she's makin' herself.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.336
I mean, come on, Liz.

20:54.336 --> 20:58.215
She's just young.
She's trying to do the right thing.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.299
No, she's not.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.803
She's just doin' it to piss me off.

21:04.137 --> 21:07.015
You know what? Don't come tellin' me
how to handle my shit.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.934
You know how many phone calls
I had to field about you

21:08.934 --> 21:11.144
kickin' the shit out
of another Trooper today?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.314
That asshole hit Leah.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.316
Yeah, he's fuckin' suspended.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.655
Are you okay?

21:24.866 --> 21:25.993
Not okay.

21:29.579 --> 21:30.497
Where are you goin'?

21:32.582 --> 21:35.669
I'm goin' to meet Kate McKittrick
and Connelly about the protests.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.755
Wait, what?
Why? That's the Troopers' job.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.090
Exactly.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.633
Ya know what?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.679
I'm kinda glad that
I'm goin' over there

21:47.222 --> 21:49.349
'cause I have somethin'
I wanna discuss with her.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.811
Look at that. You're gonna like it.

22:20.505 --> 22:24.051
- Hi. Can I take you to the--
- I'm good, thanks.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.807
Liz, thanks for comin'.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.727
Yeah. So, first of all,

22:33.727 --> 22:37.272
we all know that
the mess at the protests,

22:37.272 --> 22:40.275
that's on Troopers
running a shitty outfit.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.944
Not on APF, it's not on me.

22:44.863 --> 22:45.989
So, as long as we're here--

22:45.989 --> 22:49.201
As long as we're here, shall we?

23:04.216 --> 23:07.928
<i>So, this came from our security
cameras up north.</i>

23:07.928 --> 23:11.765
It's 9:15 this mornin'
during the lead-up to the riot.

23:12.974 --> 23:16.895
Why are you and Trooper Navarro
in a remote section of Silver Sky land?

23:20.357 --> 23:22.275
It's just a question, Liz.

23:23.693 --> 23:27.280
It's police business.
Has to do with the Tsalal investigation.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.366
On Silver Sky property.

23:30.033 --> 23:32.035
What led you to that location?

23:34.371 --> 23:37.791
Well, we got some intel about the area.

23:38.625 --> 23:39.918
There's an abandoned cave

23:39.918 --> 23:42.546
and we located an engineer

23:42.546 --> 23:46.842
who had some information
about Raymond Clark,

23:46.842 --> 23:48.677
the missing scientist.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.179
Who's the engineer?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.309
Otis Heiss.

24:00.355 --> 24:03.817
Well, the good news
for you and Mr. Heiss

24:03.817 --> 24:07.821
is that it turns out
this isn't a murder case after all.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.324
Wait, what do you mean?

24:11.908 --> 24:13.451
What does she mean?

24:15.287 --> 24:18.582
Forensics came back.
It was a weather event.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.083
"Slab avalanche."

24:20.083 --> 24:23.879
They're sudden and can move
at 100 miles an hour.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.922
An avalanche? Come on.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.384
It was the last sunset
before the long night.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.094
Theory is they went outside to watch it.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.679
What about the ears, and the eyes, and--

24:32.679 --> 24:37.142
Ruptured eardrums and damaged soft tissue
are common during a flash freeze.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.352
- Yeah, okay--
- And, and...

24:40.520 --> 24:42.939
fatal hypothermia causes hallucinations.

24:42.939 --> 24:46.067
But you're saying the official word
from Anchorage

24:46.067 --> 24:47.903
is they froze to death?

24:47.903 --> 24:50.947
Well, I know it's a relief for all of us

24:50.947 --> 24:54.075
that there's not some killer out there
on the loose.

24:54.075 --> 24:58.663
Well, it's convenient, isn't it?
'Cause the mine bankrolls Tsalal.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.917
Well, of course.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.253
I mean, we donate to a lot of worthy
research projects

25:05.253 --> 25:07.631
and Tsalal's in our own backyard.
You know what?

25:07.631 --> 25:10.467
- Their work was an incredible--
- Yeah, incredible work.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.510
But the funding

25:13.428 --> 25:17.307
is for an independent outfit
that verifies your pollution numbers.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.477
You don't think that's
a conflict of interest?

25:23.813 --> 25:28.360
Well, I'll have to look into it,
but I don't see what possible relation

25:28.360 --> 25:30.111
it could have with a weather event.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.530
Fuck you and your fucking weather event.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.741
You know what?
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

25:34.741 --> 25:37.786
Yeah.
I'm sorry Bill's such a terrible lay.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.412
You have my sympathies.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.250
Are you out of your fucking mind?

25:43.250 --> 25:45.752
The Annie K. case, remember?

25:45.752 --> 25:48.797
Look, that location, that cave,

25:48.797 --> 25:50.215
that's where she was killed.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.635
The two cases are linked.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.595
We're almost there.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.226
Three years ago, you and your partner,
Evangeline Navarro,

26:01.226 --> 26:05.355
responded to a domestic violence call
in Linden Village?

26:05.355 --> 26:08.525
William Wheeler, 43, white male.

26:08.525 --> 26:13.530
It was a murder-suicide,
except there was no suicide, was there?

26:15.782 --> 26:17.909
- I don't know what you're talking--
- Stop.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.749
This case is closed, Liz.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.795
What happened to you?

26:30.171 --> 26:32.090
A woman was murdered.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.678
Go home to your daughter.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.888
- Hey, Henry.
- Hey.

27:20.930 --> 27:24.517
- How's Peter?
- Well...

27:24.517 --> 27:27.604
kids shouldn't be getting married
that young, ya know?

27:37.697 --> 27:40.825
Danvers is not gonna let this go.

27:42.285 --> 27:45.413
She's looking for the location
of the Kowtok murder.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.044
She can't find that cave.

27:54.089 --> 27:57.801
- I don't know what I can do about that.
- The engineer.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.427
Otis Heiss.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.305
He could take her there.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.105
You should take this to Connelly.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.857
Connelly is a political animal.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.193
He's weak, and he's fuckin' her.

28:20.865 --> 28:24.035
Okay, well, I did something for you.

28:24.035 --> 28:27.080
- You broke your promise.
- Yeah, we paid you well.

28:27.080 --> 28:30.375
That money's gone.
You promised me Chief of Police.

28:30.375 --> 28:35.338
Look, I couldn't have known
Danvers was gonna be exiled here.

28:35.338 --> 28:39.676
The bureaucracy was a mess.
I had no control.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.719
This time, it's different.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.557
I'm not a killer.

28:46.099 --> 28:49.436
I didn't say those words.
Do you understand me?

28:53.148 --> 28:55.859
- I need to hear you say it.
- You didn't ask me to kill anyone.

28:55.859 --> 29:00.321
Otis Heiss is a drug addict.
Drug addicts get lost.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.490
I don't need to know the details.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.159
I don't know where to find him.

29:04.159 --> 29:07.162
So you follow Danvers.
She'll lead you to him.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.419
You do this, and the job is yours.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.801
I'm counting on ya, Henry.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.404
You okay?

30:24.822 --> 30:27.575
Yeah. Yeah.

30:29.702 --> 30:30.870
Your grandma okay?

30:30.870 --> 30:33.873
Yeah, I'm just covering for her.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.626
She went to the dentist in Fairbanks.

30:39.128 --> 30:42.090
What about you? Are you okay?

30:44.676 --> 30:46.803
Kenny! She's here!

30:47.720 --> 30:49.639
I found her! Come here.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.103
Evangeline.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.692
Kenny, tell her what you told me.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.527
Tell me what?

31:02.527 --> 31:04.988
Well, my grandpa,

31:04.988 --> 31:07.615
he taught me to walk away
when I saw those.

31:08.741 --> 31:11.703
People would leave 'em
as a warning for hunters.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.538
What kinda warning?

31:13.538 --> 31:16.124
Places where the ice
would swallow them whole.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.213
- Underground ice caves?
- Yep.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.216
Truth is, sometimes we kids
would crack the ice

31:25.216 --> 31:27.510
on purpose to go down into the caves.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.722
My grandma, she was so pissed
when she found out.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.475
Said the Night Country was gonna take us.

31:40.648 --> 31:43.359
I know how to get us in the caves.
It's so obvious.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.778
We just have to find the highest point
on the cave maps.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.072
That's how you get into
a underground cave system.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.032
Navarro--

31:49.032 --> 31:51.951
You find the place closest to the surface
and you crack in.

31:51.951 --> 31:53.995
Otis can point it out for us,
and we can just go.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.289
- Listen, listen, listen to me.
- You listen.

31:56.873 --> 32:00.543
This is big, Liz.
This connects everything.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.795
People call those caves
"The Night Country."

32:02.795 --> 32:05.006
- And then--
- No! It's over.

32:06.841 --> 32:08.718
What are you talkin' about?

32:15.975 --> 32:19.395
Forensics came back on the Tsalal men.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.232
It was a freak weather event.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.360
A what?

32:26.569 --> 32:29.822
- Are you kidding?
- Look, it doesn't matter what you believe.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.201
Connelly's shuttin' us down.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.703
Fine.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.205
Fuck Tsalal.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.291
- Annie's a whole separate case.
- He knows about Wheeler.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.389
What did he say?

32:55.973 --> 32:57.100
He knows.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.268
All of it.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.771
I don't even know how.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.233
You know what?
I don't even care.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.110
If I can find where Annie died--

33:07.110 --> 33:08.444
What do you think you're gonna find?

33:08.444 --> 33:09.696
A signed confession on the wall?

33:09.696 --> 33:11.572
A murder weapon, DNA.

33:11.572 --> 33:12.949
Anything that's gonna help us find her.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.242
Even if you found something,
he's gonna block it.

33:14.242 --> 33:17.662
- No, you gotta stop now!
- Stop?

33:18.204 --> 33:19.664
What are you even saying?

33:19.664 --> 33:22.709
It ends here. Alright? It's over.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.962
No. I'm gonna go talk to Otis.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.214
- He can point it out on the map...
- No.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.674
...and he can find it for us.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.093
You're not gonna go to Otis
because The Lighthouse

33:32.093 --> 33:34.137
isn't gonna let you in after what you did.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.557
You just gotta-- Please!
You just-- It's over!

33:37.557 --> 33:39.183
Just let it go!

33:40.184 --> 33:41.728
Just let her go.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.022
It's time.

33:55.783 --> 33:56.701
No.

33:58.911 --> 34:00.163
You carry her now.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.877
Like I did, all this time.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.714
You carry Annie.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.383
Every day.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.929
You're leaving her, alone,

34:18.389 --> 34:22.310
in that cave, in the dark.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.021
You.

34:31.819 --> 34:32.945
She's yours now.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.387
Is Liz letting me go?

34:58.387 --> 35:00.223
Fuck Liz.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.497
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.916
What the hell was that all about?

35:28.334 --> 35:32.255
- Oh, just family stuff, ya know?
- Yeah.

35:37.677 --> 35:38.761
You...

35:40.137 --> 35:41.264
you need anything?

35:41.264 --> 35:43.307
Me? No. I'm...

35:50.106 --> 35:51.649
I...

35:55.570 --> 35:57.864
I was thinking about that time
when you were nine,

35:57.864 --> 36:00.491
when you were skating
and you fell through the ice.

36:02.159 --> 36:03.452
Ya know

36:05.037 --> 36:06.956
I don't really remember a lot of that, so.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.500
You don't? Oh, I do.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.336
I wake up dreaming of it sometimes.

36:14.255 --> 36:17.341
One second you were there,
I turned around, and boom,

36:17.341 --> 36:21.888
you were gone,
under the ice, current took ya.

36:22.763 --> 36:25.933
I had to run on ahead of ya
and try to break through

36:25.933 --> 36:28.352
<i>with a ice axe.</i>

36:30.104 --> 36:34.066
<i>I kept hacking until I got through,
and then I pulled you out.</i>

36:40.823 --> 36:42.742
Then, on the way to the hospital,

36:43.868 --> 36:46.203
I knew I had to keep you awake.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.665
Just keep you awake.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.294
Felt like we were driving for days.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.886
I was--

37:05.932 --> 37:07.850
Family stuff, right?

37:11.228 --> 37:12.772
Fuckin' family.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.118
There!

38:09.036 --> 38:12.039
I think that should do it.

38:19.922 --> 38:20.840
Thanks, Rose.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.010
Do ya want me to stay with ya?

38:31.225 --> 38:34.145
Well, the weather's shit,
so don't be long.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.484
They're saying we're
getting a category four.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.575
Here you go, babygirl.

38:50.244 --> 38:54.165
I thought,
if you wanted to be in the ocean...

39:30.242 --> 39:33.579
<i>Evangeline.</i>

39:39.543 --> 39:41.462
<i>Listen.</i>

39:49.887 --> 39:52.431
Lie down! Towards me.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.643
Lie down!

39:57.478 --> 39:58.896
Slowly.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.773
Towards me.

40:03.442 --> 40:04.485
Take that.

40:16.038 --> 40:19.041
You're alright. You're okay.

40:19.834 --> 40:23.796
What the fuck were you doing
walking into the sea like that?

40:25.005 --> 40:27.550
I called you back.
Didn't ya hear me?

40:52.241 --> 40:53.367
Peter's not here.

40:54.368 --> 40:55.828
I'm looking for Leah.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.413
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.373
Please.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.214
Lee?

41:08.299 --> 41:09.842
What do you want?

41:11.177 --> 41:12.720
Why are you doing this?

41:13.262 --> 41:15.014
Just to mess with me?

41:15.514 --> 41:17.099
Not everything's about you, Liz.

41:19.768 --> 41:20.936
What the fuck?

41:21.854 --> 41:23.189
Is that bruises?

41:23.189 --> 41:24.732
Don't worry about it.

41:25.983 --> 41:27.860
You could've been killed.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.946
Don't be dramatic.
It's not like you.

41:33.240 --> 41:36.577
- I'm workin' on this case.
- Annie K.?

41:39.914 --> 41:42.249
Everything she fought for
is still happening.

41:44.501 --> 41:46.086
Do you know how many
stillbirths there were

41:46.086 --> 41:48.130
in the villages in the past three months?

41:48.589 --> 41:51.133
- I know about Aviaq Carter's--
- Nine.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.221
That's nine moms, Liz.

41:59.642 --> 42:00.768
Leah,

42:02.895 --> 42:05.439
will you please just come home
for New Year's?

42:08.943 --> 42:10.903
Come home, please.

42:20.454 --> 42:21.580
Liz?

42:24.124 --> 42:26.043
You know I haven't given up on you.

43:16.176 --> 43:19.263
<i>It'll be another three months
before we can dig any graves.</i>

43:21.348 --> 43:23.100
So they're stuck here.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.980
Least they keep each other company.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.774
Especially the little ones.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.612
You want me to stay?

43:36.280 --> 43:38.032
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.485
Hey, Chief.

44:50.229 --> 44:51.980
Did you talk to Connelly?

45:05.202 --> 45:07.454
In my office. Bring that thing now.

45:15.337 --> 45:16.672
Close the door.

45:23.220 --> 45:25.264
Who'd you talk to about Wheeler?

45:26.098 --> 45:27.266
No one.

45:27.266 --> 45:30.227
Well, Connelly knows
because your father knows.

45:32.771 --> 45:34.690
What's the password to your computer?

45:35.441 --> 45:36.984
- Is it your birthday?
- No.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.820
Let me guess. It's Darwin's.

45:43.365 --> 45:45.033
How many times I gotta tell you?

45:45.033 --> 45:46.702
Your father only seems like an idiot.

45:46.702 --> 45:49.121
Sit. Sit!

45:57.296 --> 45:59.548
What do you think you
know about Wheeler?

46:05.179 --> 46:06.096
Fine.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.141
You wanna do it differently?

46:09.933 --> 46:11.477
You make up the questions.

46:12.644 --> 46:15.397
You just had to know, right?
You had to keep digging.

46:15.397 --> 46:17.399
That's what Hank found in there.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.776
I bet he was asking you.

46:19.776 --> 46:21.695
"What do they know about the mine?"

46:22.905 --> 46:25.157
And then, bingo,
his kid gives him a little present.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.409
- I wasn't digging for anything.
- Yeah, go. Ask me questions.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.869
- Question me.
- I don't wanna do that.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.329
- Ask me questions.
- No.

46:30.329 --> 46:31.622
- I don't wanna--
- You wanted to know!

46:31.622 --> 46:32.998
Ask me the fucking questions!

46:32.998 --> 46:35.209
Ask the questions, Prior!

46:39.421 --> 46:40.547
Alright. Fine.

46:41.965 --> 46:44.718
How many times did you and Navarro
visit the Wheeler household?

46:45.636 --> 46:47.221
I'm not sure.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.639
- Three.
- Ten.

46:49.139 --> 46:51.850
Ten times you were there.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.478
And what was the situation

46:54.478 --> 46:56.813
- on those visits to the Wheeler--
- Wrong question, ask again.

46:57.773 --> 46:58.899
Ask again.

47:00.025 --> 47:02.569
- Did Wheeler ever show any signs of be--
- Wrong question.

47:05.072 --> 47:08.408
- Did you think Wheeler was capable of--
- Wrong question. Ask again.

47:10.244 --> 47:12.579
Did you know Wheeler was left-handed?

47:16.667 --> 47:17.584
No.

47:21.088 --> 47:22.631
I did not.

47:34.434 --> 47:36.520
What direction are the blows in?

47:43.151 --> 47:45.904
Right to left. All of 'em.

47:53.370 --> 47:57.291
This is her senior yearbook photo.

47:58.584 --> 48:00.335
You see the birthmark, right?

48:01.878 --> 48:07.968
Someone flipped every single photo
in her file.

48:13.932 --> 48:15.684
That bullet wound

48:18.478 --> 48:19.896
on his right-hand side.

48:23.817 --> 48:27.362
Everything else:
the ballistics, forensics report,

48:28.655 --> 48:30.407
it's all gone in the flood.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.663
Ask the real question, Prior.

48:37.831 --> 48:38.957
Go on.

48:43.253 --> 48:47.799
Did you and Navarro
shoot William Wheeler

48:49.217 --> 48:51.345
and make it look like a suicide?

49:01.396 --> 49:02.522
You see?

49:03.732 --> 49:05.651
Smart as you are,

49:08.737 --> 49:11.865
you need to learn
when to stop asking questions.

49:16.244 --> 49:17.788
You can't stay at Hank's.

49:20.791 --> 49:25.003
This is to the shack
in the backyard of my house.

49:25.921 --> 49:28.256
I don't have to see you.
You don't have to see me.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.136
Just don't be stupid. Stupider.

49:33.887 --> 49:35.013
Take the key.

49:54.199 --> 49:56.952
- Pete?
- Get the fuck away from me.

50:05.502 --> 50:06.420
Hey!

50:07.504 --> 50:09.423
Do not fucking touch me!

52:05.831 --> 52:06.957
Thank you.

52:11.211 --> 52:13.630
Fuck, no! No!

52:14.673 --> 52:16.842
Come on, you're comin' with me.

52:16.842 --> 52:19.970
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I got you what you wanted.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.180
Alright?
We're gonna get you feeling better,

52:22.180 --> 52:24.724
and you're gonna guide us through
those caves.

52:24.724 --> 52:25.976
Come on.

52:26.601 --> 52:27.602
Show me.

52:41.408 --> 52:42.534
Give it over.

52:43.076 --> 52:45.579
I'm not lettin' you get high in my truck,
in public.

52:45.579 --> 52:48.415
Then fuck you and fuck your cave.

52:48.999 --> 52:50.292
Hey, you walk out that door

52:50.292 --> 52:52.502
and I'm sending your ass
right back to jail.

52:53.795 --> 52:55.130
What's it gonna be?

53:01.303 --> 53:02.429
Alright.

53:06.474 --> 53:08.059
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey.

53:08.059 --> 53:10.520
Meet me at my place.
We're goin' to where Annie died.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.814
I thought you said the case was closed.

53:12.814 --> 53:14.190
<i>I was wrong.</i>

53:25.911 --> 53:27.412
You're not gonna stop me?

53:28.955 --> 53:32.083
Just come back, okay?

53:49.100 --> 53:50.518
Come back.

54:00.987 --> 54:02.614
Bathroom's over there.

54:04.115 --> 54:05.450
Show me.

54:07.702 --> 54:09.037
Show me.

54:13.833 --> 54:16.252
Here, off Niksik Pass.

54:17.253 --> 54:18.964
That's the highest point.

54:24.844 --> 54:25.971
Take it easy

54:26.680 --> 54:28.390
and don't leave a mess.

55:16.813 --> 55:18.940
Come on! Let's go!

55:31.703 --> 55:32.787
Navarro?

55:35.665 --> 55:37.709
- Hey.
- What are you doin' here?

55:37.709 --> 55:40.462
Connelly wants me
to bring in the engineer.

55:41.713 --> 55:44.424
- What are you talkin' about?
- The junkie. Otis Heiss.

55:44.424 --> 55:46.259
I'm supposed to take him in.

55:46.760 --> 55:49.137
- What for?
- Something about an outstanding warrant.

55:49.137 --> 55:51.973
He skipped bail in Noatak or some shit.

55:53.433 --> 55:55.393
Why didn't Connelly just ask me himself?

55:55.393 --> 55:58.021
I don't know,
maybe it's below your pay grade.

55:58.021 --> 56:01.858
Come on. You think I wanna be here
on New Year's Eve

56:01.858 --> 56:04.277
collecting some junkie?

56:04.819 --> 56:07.155
How'd you know Otis Heiss was here?

56:08.907 --> 56:11.367
Oh, he's here? In the house?

56:11.367 --> 56:13.912
I was just wantin' you
to point me in a direction.

56:15.205 --> 56:16.790
Yeah, I'm callin' Connelly.

56:16.790 --> 56:20.627
Just give him to me.
Jesus Christ, Liz.

56:20.627 --> 56:22.545
Does everything have to be
a fucking battle with you?

56:22.545 --> 56:25.256
- What the fuck's going on?
- You're comin' with me.

56:25.256 --> 56:26.883
No, no, no, no. You're not.

56:27.509 --> 56:30.678
Listen, look, I don't know
what's goin' on, Hank,

56:30.678 --> 56:33.139
but you can still walk
out that front door

56:33.139 --> 56:34.599
and everything can still be okay.

56:34.599 --> 56:37.519
- Fuck this. I'm outta here.
- Do not fucking move!

56:37.519 --> 56:39.813
Put the gun down, Hank.

56:40.522 --> 56:41.689
No, I'm taking him.

56:41.689 --> 56:44.067
I'm gonna do this the way you did Wheeler.

56:44.067 --> 56:48.613
Look, I don't know what they have on you,
but whatever it is, we can fix it.

56:48.613 --> 56:50.990
- Okay? We can fix this.
- You turned my kid against me.

56:50.990 --> 56:54.536
- We can't fix that, can we?
- Your son loves you. He loves you.

56:54.536 --> 56:57.038
He doesn't wanna see you
do anything fucked up.

56:57.038 --> 56:58.206
- Okay?
- Hey!

57:01.292 --> 57:02.210
Back up.

57:03.461 --> 57:04.838
- Back up, Liz.
- Okay.

57:04.838 --> 57:06.089
Stay there!

57:07.841 --> 57:09.384
Jesus Christ.

57:12.762 --> 57:13.763
What's goin' on?

57:16.141 --> 57:17.725
Lower your weapon, Pete.

57:21.104 --> 57:24.607
Prior, don't.
Think about it. Think.

57:27.443 --> 57:29.154
- Dad?
- We gotta get him outta here.

57:29.154 --> 57:31.281
Prior, think.

57:31.281 --> 57:32.949
- Think.
- Come on.

57:32.949 --> 57:34.492
Let's get him into my truck.

57:37.036 --> 57:38.997
Prior, don't. Think about it.

57:41.166 --> 57:42.834
Come on. I need your help, son.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.043
Prior.

57:45.461 --> 57:46.588
Help me.

57:55.805 --> 57:57.348
You should know something.

57:58.474 --> 58:01.144
I didn't kill Annie K.
I just moved her body.

58:03.855 --> 58:05.190
Blood is blood, Peter.

58:08.443 --> 58:09.777
Remember that.

58:11.446 --> 58:12.572
No!

58:27.503 --> 58:28.755
It's okay.

59:22.767 --> 59:25.144
- Gonna call Connelly.
- No, no, no, no, no.

59:25.144 --> 59:27.355
- Yeah, we gotta call him right now.
- No, you're not calling anybody.

59:27.355 --> 59:28.564
Listen!

59:29.983 --> 59:34.612
If you bring Connelly into this,
that kid's goin' down.

59:35.196 --> 59:39.492
Connelly is in on this.
He will bury every single one of us.

59:44.914 --> 59:47.041
No. This...

59:48.251 --> 59:49.794
- this didn't happen.
- What?

59:49.794 --> 59:51.045
Hank was never here.

59:51.713 --> 59:54.257
He snatched Otis, and he shot him.

59:55.550 --> 59:57.885
But when he tried
to get rid of the body,

59:57.885 --> 59:59.387
he had an accident.

01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:02.557
His truck will be there,

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.559
but he'll never be found.

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.103
We can't fix this.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.354
- It's too big. We can't fix it.
- Listen, Liz,

01:00:08.354 --> 01:00:12.025
Hank was sent here to stop us
from finding where Annie died.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.776
We are this close.

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:16.321
The storm will help cover our tracks.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:19.157
That's why we have to go right now.

01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:24.037
She's right.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.879
We gotta clean this up.

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.637
No, I'll clean.

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:45.516
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:48.102
- No, you gotta go.
- No, Pete. You can't do that.

01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:50.730
- She can't go into those caves alone.
- I can't leave you alone.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.399
She can't make it in those caves alone.

01:00:53.399 --> 01:00:54.859
- You know that.
- That's your dad.

01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:58.363
Listen.
You clean, you clean good.

01:00:59.113 --> 01:01:00.656
You know what to do.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.701
Then get the bodies to Rose Aguineau.

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:05.536
Okay?

01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:07.789
Tell her I said take you to Julia.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:08.998
Say it!

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.666
Take me to Julia.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.548
Please just go.

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:22.720
Move it, Liz.

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:25.306
This is mine.
