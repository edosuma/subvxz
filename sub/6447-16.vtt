...but I stopped you from doing something
you'd have regretted the rest of your life.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.863
Davis came after me.
I was protecting myself.

38:05.033 --> 38:08.446
But you don't believe me.
You'd rather believe anyone else but me.

38:08.870 --> 38:11.486
People are watching us.
Can we talk about this at home?

38:11.665 --> 38:13.030
Home?

38:13.667 --> 38:15.498
We have no home, Chloe.

38:17.837 --> 38:20.214
Okay, you still have a lot of drugs
in your system--

38:20.382 --> 38:23.545
No, no, no.
My mind has never been so clear.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.585
I have put up with you
taking someone else's side over mine.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.219
First Clark, and then Davis?

38:30.600 --> 38:34.559
Look, I realize now
you just don't trust me.

38:37.357 --> 38:38.563
You never have.

38:41.111 --> 38:44.399
Of course I trust you. I trust you
with my whole heart. I'm your wife.

38:44.572 --> 38:48.064
And that's what I don't understand.
Why the hell did you even marry me?

38:48.243 --> 38:49.858
-Sir, settle down.
-l'm ﬁne.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.244
-We were just leaving.
-l'm not going anywhere with you.

38:53.415 --> 38:56.373
Come on, Jimmy,
we can work through this.

38:57.043 --> 39:01.082
I'm done trying to make this work.

39:03.925 --> 39:08.669
Marrying you
was the biggest mistake of my life.

MAN:
Mr. Olsen, Miss Mercer's not in.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.947
I cannot let you in here.
I'm calling security.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.536
Don't bother. I quit.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.622
If she really wants
to move more papers...

39:41.796 --> 39:44.253
...tell her to put this
