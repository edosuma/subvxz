WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:02.029
Where's the SIM card she gave you?

00:02.080 --> 00:04.030
I'll give it to my client, no-one else.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.870
Where is it now?

00:05.920 --> 00:08.310
Where's the SIM card?
No idea.

00:08.360 --> 00:11.150
Why's Tony Pullings
crawling out of the woodwork?

00:11.200 --> 00:14.030
He stopped me in the street,
asked me if I wanted to be famous.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.830
I know nothing about Tony Pullings.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.870
Yeah, well,
I know who you're protecting.

00:18.920 --> 00:22.110
I'm protecting you, Tony.
I have all your negatives, remember?

00:22.160 --> 00:24.590
The men that are guarding
Pullings are American.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.310
What's your interest in Kevin Russell?

00:27.360 --> 00:29.110
We have no interest in him.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.790
We have an interest in you.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.750
I followed your lead, I found nothing.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.510
The Americans are not involved.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.070
He's running for the leadership.
Will he win?

00:39.120 --> 00:42.270
He is where your investment should lie.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.030
The defence pathologist
has an alternate theory

00:45.080 --> 00:48.310
of how the girl was killed.
Then advance a counter-theory.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.750
It's hard when her
theory is actually true.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.510
She was hit by a car.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.590
Find the angle, do your job.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.150
Are they yours? Do you
want something? I do.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.320
Well, she can protect me, you can't.
'She'? Who's 'she'?

01:07.040 --> 01:10.080
<i>Way down in the water</i>

01:13.840 --> 01:16.600
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

01:18.120 --> 01:20.670
<i>Far away from any soul</i>

01:20.720 --> 01:24.310
Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony

01:24.360 --> 01:26.470
and where there is despair,
may we bring hope.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.160
<i>I'm coming back from the fire</i>

01:31.760 --> 01:33.670
Put your trust in us.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.310
<i>Crawling back from the flames</i>

01:35.360 --> 01:37.760
We shall repay that trust for you.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.710
<i>Coming back from the fire,
and I'll burn it down</i>

01:43.760 --> 01:45.910
Turn it! Turn!

01:45.960 --> 01:47.280
Spin the camera.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.640
Spin the camera!

01:59.840 --> 02:01.840
Uh...

02:02.880 --> 02:04.790
Kevin, remember what we said.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.498
Just tell the truth and
we'll put this right, OK?

02:07.698 --> 02:08.030
Yeah.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.080
See you up there.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.760
That, in your view, is what happened?

02:30.840 --> 02:32.550
Linda was not hit with a shovel?

02:32.600 --> 02:35.630
No man wielding a shovel could
produce the wedge fractures

02:35.680 --> 02:38.910
that broke all four bones in
Linda's legs simultaneously.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.870
That could only be done by a car?

02:41.920 --> 02:45.000
It could only be done by a car.
Thank you.

02:47.480 --> 02:51.070
Mr Russell, in February 2003,

02:51.120 --> 02:55.670
did you have a car or access to a
car the weekend Linda disappeared?

02:55.720 --> 02:57.310
No.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.040
So you couldn't have
hit Linda with a car?

03:02.120 --> 03:03.390
No.

03:03.440 --> 03:07.670
So why did you confess to
hitting her with a shovel?

03:07.720 --> 03:09.910
I was questioned for two days straight.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.350
It's on the tapes.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.270
Plus, I was feeling guilty because...

03:15.320 --> 03:17.760
I knew about Linda and the photos.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.070
Annie, my fiancee, is pregnant

03:23.120 --> 03:25.590
and I've got photos of this girl naked.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.550
But, still, why confess to murder?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.670
The police are showing
me all this stuff,

03:32.720 --> 03:35.430
traces of Linda in my hut,

03:35.480 --> 03:37.470
her hair, bits of clothing...

03:37.520 --> 03:39.640
and then her body buried 20 yards away.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.480
I was going completely mental.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.430
You know, how did she get there?
What happened?

03:47.480 --> 03:48.990
What did I do?

03:49.040 --> 03:52.190
Detective Greenwood, she was so certain.

03:52.240 --> 03:55.030
She started saying that she
didn't need me to confess

03:55.080 --> 03:57.630
because she had all the evidence

03:57.680 --> 04:01.960
but that it would go better for
me in court if I told the truth.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.790
Then at least...

04:06.840 --> 04:09.560
Then at least my boy could
see that I'd been a man.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.200
That'd I'd stood up and
I'd told the truth.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.950
So I said I did it.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.310
But you didn't?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.360
No. I didn't do it.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.710
Because I couldn't.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.550
I didn't have a car.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.350
Mr Russell.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.120
Thank you.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.280
Ms Osborne, do you have any questions?

04:46.880 --> 04:48.550
Ms Osborne?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.600
I'm sorry, my Lord.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.390
Ms Osborne?

04:55.440 --> 04:57.990
Er... I'd like Mr Russell
to look at something.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.550
My Lord, what is this?

04:59.600 --> 05:03.360
A crime scene photo of Mr Russell's
workshop. It's already in evidence.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.190
Carry on, Ms Osborne.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.310
Do you recognise the photo?

05:09.860 --> 05:10.630
Yeah.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.790
And in the photo,
in the bottom right-hand corner,

05:13.840 --> 05:16.670
next to the tape measure, what are they?

05:16.720 --> 05:18.870
Well, they're keys.
To what?

05:18.920 --> 05:20.350
The school van.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.070
And they were kept in your workshop?

05:22.120 --> 05:24.550
Well, a spare set,
in case the main set got lost

05:24.600 --> 05:26.550
or shut up in the school.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.550
Could you drive this van?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.670
Well, of course, I was the caretaker.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.480
And you had access to it at any time?

05:37.440 --> 05:39.510
No.
But the keys were right there.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.910
You could have driven
the van at any time.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.790
You could have driven the van at any time...
No.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.630
.. including the night that Linda died.
No.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.070
Answer, please, Mr Russell. You could
have driven the van at any time.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.360
No! Emma?

05:54.360 --> 05:56.360
What... Wh-what... What do I say?

05:58.760 --> 06:01.320
Answer, please, Mr Russell.
Emma?

06:03.560 --> 06:06.190
Emma, what do I say?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.240
Emma?

06:10.680 --> 06:12.680
Emma, what do I say?

06:14.680 --> 06:16.470
I was watching the jury.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.070
In their eyes,
Kevin went from completely innocent

06:19.120 --> 06:20.910
to completely guilty in 30 seconds.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.550
It wasn't just the jury.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.110
Jason thought that
Kevin was innocent too.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.360
For a few seconds,
he'd got his dad back.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.720
Do you want another one?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.190
Hey!

06:37.240 --> 06:38.630
Sorry...
What was that?

06:38.680 --> 06:40.830
It's all right.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.670
I do apologise. Sorry about that.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.510
No problem. I'll clear it up.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.560
Thank you.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.560
What is it?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.590
Yusef Attar wants to meet me.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.510
What, he's here in the UK?

07:01.560 --> 07:04.110
Jesus! Em, you can't.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.470
You have to steer clear,
now more than ever.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.350
His wife's going crazy in jail.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.400
He's got a kid in there too.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.040
I can't just do nothing.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.670
As you know, I fought in the war.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.990
I was one of the lucky ones,
I got out with life and limb intact.

07:26.040 --> 07:30.360
Many didn't, many men and women
that I was honoured to serve with.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.710
And it's to them that
I make two pledges.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.110
If ever I'm in a position to influence
the policies of this country,

07:38.160 --> 07:40.790
I will fight with every
bone in my body to make sure

07:40.840 --> 07:44.680
that our veterans get all the
care they and their families need.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.522
My second pledge is that
we will never go to war

07:50.722 --> 07:53.190
unless our interests
are directly threatened.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.950
We will honour our alliances but we
will not sacrifice our men and women

07:57.000 --> 08:00.070
to other nations'
misguided ambitions and strategies.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.520
That'll go down well in Washington.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.830
Kretchmer asked me to talk to you.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.590
He must be pleased.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.430
I hear Russell blew
himself up in court today.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.480
I blew him up.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.790
But it was just dumb luck.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.070
Kretchmer wants to take the win.
Hm.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.120
He wants you to end the trial now.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.030
But how?

08:27.080 --> 08:29.080
I don't have that power.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.909
Then you'd better find it.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.669
And now my lovely wife, Laura, will draw
the winning numbers from tonight's raffle.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.720
So get your tickets ready.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.600
If this goes to the jury,
there are no guarantees.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.560
Quit while we're ahead.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.030
What's that?
Abu al-Tabib.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.750
It means 'father doctor',
'father physician'.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.230
It's how they often
refer to Yusef Attar.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.790
What are they saying?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.790
They're implying that
he's back in the UK,

09:07.840 --> 09:09.670
because the Kafir jailed his wife.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.680
Better let SO15 know about this.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.110
Hello.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.270
Emma, at last!
Miriam, it's late.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.510
It's the only time I
could get to the phones.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.390
Emma, you have to get us out.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.790
I'm trying. They're just playing
hardball because of Yusef.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.270
I don't know where he
is or what he's doing.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.190
Please explain this to them.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.310
The women, they call me a
terrorist. They want to fight.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.350
I'm scared for Karim.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.040
I can try and get you moved.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.870
Please, no. Get me out!

09:56.640 --> 09:58.910
Miriam, please just try and remain calm.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.390
How can I stay calm if I'm going mad?

10:01.940 --> 10:03.410
My money's going.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.550
Emma, come and see me. I've no-one else.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.520
It's Alastair.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.910
I'm calling in that favour.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.710
Kevin Russell.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.750
So that's our position.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.950
The CPS would accept a plea to
the lesser charge of manslaughter.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.710
The victim's family have been
consulted and have agreed.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.950
The most the judge would've imposed
would be 12 years, so your client...

10:51.000 --> 10:53.480
No.
.. would be released for time served.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.430
No.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.830
I thought you would say that.
So why did you bother asking me?

10:59.880 --> 11:02.150
I'm not asking you,
I'm asking your client.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.190
And you're obliged to
present this to him.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.000
Aren't you?

11:11.680 --> 11:13.030
So...

11:13.080 --> 11:15.870
it'd be like an accident?

11:15.920 --> 11:18.150
I hit her with the car by accident?

11:18.200 --> 11:21.750
No, you'd be saying that you killed
Linda but you didn't intend to.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.710
That sounds like an accident to me.
It's not.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.550
I don't want to sugar-coat this for you.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.300
You'd be admitting you hit
her with a van and killed her.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.910
And then buried her while
she was still alive?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.800
I'd... I'd be admitting that too?

11:36.160 --> 11:38.160
Why aren't you saying anything?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.230
Because I don't like this.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.150
So you think I shouldn't do it,
that we're gonna win?

11:44.200 --> 11:46.190
I think we CAN win.
And you don't?

11:46.240 --> 11:49.430
The way I read the jury,
I think we could lose completely,

11:49.480 --> 11:52.150
which means a guilty verdict for murder,

11:52.200 --> 11:55.160
which means at least another 15 years.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.670
And if I...
If I accept this 'manslaughter' thing...

11:59.720 --> 12:01.790
Then you're free.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.990
You've done the time,
you've paid your debt.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.000
Will I get to see Jason?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.430
I've been watching him in court.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.230
He's been every day.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.270
I think he knows the truth...

12:14.320 --> 12:16.070
that I didn't do it.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.120
I want to get to know my son.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.680
Emma, you've got me this far.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.480
Tell me what to do.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.080
All rise.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.750
Right. Mr Nolenn?

12:51.800 --> 12:55.230
As discussed, my Lord, the defendant
would like the indictment put again.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.280
Stand up, Mr Russell.

12:58.320 --> 13:03.950
Mr Russell, you are charged on an
indictment containing one count of murder,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.910
in that on a day between
1st and 3rd February, 2003,

13:07.960 --> 13:09.830
you murdered Linda Simms.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.280
How do you plead?

13:12.800 --> 13:17.510
I plead not guilty to murder, my Lord,
but... guilty to manslaughter.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.710
Ms Osborne?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.590
My Lord, we were on notice of this plea.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.950
In the light of the
forensic ambiguities,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.510
we will not be seeking a
verdict on the murder count.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.510
And a verdict of not guilty on
the murder count will be entered.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.150
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your time.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.910
You are welcome to return for
the sentencing of Mr Russell

13:38.960 --> 13:40.670
for the offence of manslaughter.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.910
But I will tell you
that this is a formality,

13:43.960 --> 13:48.350
since Mr Russell has already served the term
he would have received for this offence.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.990
He will be released as
early as is practicable.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.930
Case is closed.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.480
All rise.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.760
I'm surprised you took the deal.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.880
It was his decision.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.870
And whatever he said in there...

14:37.920 --> 14:39.480
.. he's innocent.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.880
Then... who killed Linda Simms?

14:44.160 --> 14:46.430
The people who protected Tony Pullings.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.360
The people who scared my witness off.
And who are they?

14:50.920 --> 14:52.910
Tell me where Pullings is.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.400
He knows.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.560
You know you missed him in 2003.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.750
He was a material witness
right under your nose.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.790
And you missed him.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.520
And you have to know he's
not working alone now.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.840
So...

15:16.840 --> 15:18.240
.. where is he?

15:20.800 --> 15:23.480
Where's Yusef Attar?
I've no idea.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.840
But you know he's back in the UK.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.920
So where is he?

15:35.720 --> 15:37.040
Well, then.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.750
'The second Russell trial cost
the UK taxpayer nearly £2 million.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.630
And the result?
The same, Russell's guilt confirmed.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.750
When will the courts stamp down
on the irresponsible actions

15:57.800 --> 15:59.830
of attention-seeking activist lawyers?'

15:59.880 --> 16:01.870
That's you.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.200
Yeah, well, they're not wrong, are they?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.560
Well, what did I achieve?

16:09.640 --> 16:11.640
Maybe it's time to stop.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.830
Maybe I've lost my...

16:14.880 --> 16:17.750
Maybe it's time to crawl on my
knees to the adoption services

16:17.800 --> 16:20.990
and tell them that I've stopped,
beg for a second chance.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.430
Seriously?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.190
Why not?

16:25.240 --> 16:27.790
My house is now empty.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.840
I still long for a child.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.790
Speaking of which,
when we've finished with Kevin,

16:35.840 --> 16:37.870
I want to go to Sizemore,
see Miriam and Karim.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
Hold that thought.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.900
Hurry. Get him.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.420
Mr Russell, how do you feel about
the reopening of old wounds?

17:08.720 --> 17:12.630
Hi, Emma, Kev.
Hi, Annie, Jason.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.400
I thought we could have a
coffee and a chat, yeah?

17:18.480 --> 17:20.270
Why don't we all sit together, Kev?

17:20.319 --> 17:22.319
I've waited 14 years, Annie.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.950
Um... well,
why don't Annie and I have a quick walk?

17:27.000 --> 17:30.670
Great. So do you want
a tea or a coffee or...

17:30.720 --> 17:32.310
Coke.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.590
Or Coke?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.640
Be kind, love. I'm just outside.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.790
He didn't wanna come.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.870
In the end, Derek had to insist.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.190
Well,
I told Kevin not to expect too much.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.270
Oh, I got him a part-time job.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.990
And accommodation.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.030
Jason? What happened?

17:57.080 --> 17:59.070
Nothing happened.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.790
I wanna go home.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.110
What did you do?
Told him it was all bullshit.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.760
He killed her.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.350
I told him to stay away from me.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.520
Jay, how could you?

18:21.180 --> 18:22.070
Kevin!

18:37.360 --> 18:38.360
Hi.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.510
Any news?

18:42.760 --> 18:44.510
They're still operating.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.230
So there's still a chance?

18:47.280 --> 18:49.280
How? I saw it. The truck...

18:50.400 --> 18:53.430
Where's Annie?
Erm... with Jason.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.470
He's taken it really badly.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.430
As he should, the little shit.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.480
He's a kid.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.670
You're right.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.720
It's not his fault.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.400
I told Kevin I believed he didn't do it.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.710
And I said I'd prove it.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.760
And I didn't.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.990
And then I gave up on him.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.270
Hardly.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.320
I let him take that stupid deal.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.390
I betrayed my client!

19:39.440 --> 19:41.840
Em, you did everything you could.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.950
'Where's Yusef Attar?'

20:13.000 --> 20:14.990
'No idea.'

20:15.040 --> 20:17.030
'But you know he's back in the UK.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.080
Where is he?'

20:20.240 --> 20:24.150
'I think he's a bad egg, Dom,
and I think he's screwing me.'

20:24.200 --> 20:26.190
'You still have the SIM card?'

20:26.240 --> 20:28.240
'Why, what's on it?'

20:30.080 --> 20:32.400
'Can you give it to Yusef's nephew?'

20:44.600 --> 20:46.430
Matt.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.360
Heather.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.470
You can thank me if you want.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.880
Old reliable,
cleaning up the Brits' mess.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.830
Not just our mess.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.070
In fact, primarily, not our mess.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.400
Soon we won't be able to do this,
you know?

21:03.720 --> 21:05.710
Secret assignations.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.750
You'll be far too well known.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.230
I doubt it.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.280
Don't doubt it. You'll win.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.830
Which is why I wanted to see you.

21:17.880 --> 21:21.710
That speech two days ago did
not go down well in Washington.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.630
It didn't sound like the
words of a stalwart ally.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.470
I will not be dictated to,

21:26.520 --> 21:28.670
Alastair told me you
were worth investing in.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.790
So do you want to sit at the top table,

21:30.840 --> 21:34.350
make a difference in the world,
or do you just want to make speeches,

21:34.400 --> 21:36.480
like the last two leaders of your party?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.670
Is it really over?

21:47.720 --> 21:49.510
Kevin Russell?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.120
Yes.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.110
The girl's back in the ground

21:54.160 --> 21:56.910
and no-one's gonna have the
energy to dig her up again.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.790
Not even Emma Banville.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.830
What about Tony Pullings?

22:01.880 --> 22:05.080
He's off the grid.
Soon we'll have him out of the country.

22:31.480 --> 22:32.470
What do you want?

22:32.520 --> 22:35.350
Kevin Russell's in a coma.
I heard.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.390
He was talking to his son Jason.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.590
Jason said he knew he was guilty.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.790
He walked into a truck. Does that
sound like the act of a guilty man?

22:42.840 --> 22:44.750
Yes, possibly.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.510
Look, I'm not gonna let this go.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.590
Just tell me how I can
find Tony Pullings.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.230
Tell me how to find Yusef Attar.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.110
You know I can't do that.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.070
Do you understand?

22:57.120 --> 22:59.120
I can't do that.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.040
Ruby's playing games again.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.640
Where is she?

23:34.120 --> 23:35.910
Banville went dark ten minutes ago.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.760
She often goes dark.
Not like this. She's in Birmingham.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.390
Jenna, she just called me.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.870
She might be sending a message.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.600
Have everyone standing by.
Stand by.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.750
She got in a cab outside
Birmingham station.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.920
We've got the number plates
and we're talking to dispatch.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.630
Throw the battery.
I've done it.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.680
Let me see.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.920
Put this on.

25:01.560 --> 25:05.670
Dispatch have said she's got out on
St Paul's Road, middle of Sparkhill.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.190
There's no hope of tracing her.
What do we do?

25:08.240 --> 25:09.960
We wait.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.070
Thank you for everything
you did for my family,

25:52.120 --> 25:53.790
for looking after them so well.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.870
Yusef, I need to know what you're doing.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.110
You must know how
risky it is being here.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.750
I'm breaking the law by even meeting you.
I know you.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.670
I know you don't care about the law.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.990
No, I care passionately about the law.
That's why I'm defending you.

26:07.040 --> 26:10.150
And as your lawyer, I advise you
to come with me to the police now.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.190
Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.240
You're scared.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.670
Yeah, I'm scared.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.720
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.320
What I need from you is the
SIM card my wife gave you.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.870
You have it, yes?
What's on the card?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.640
What my friends said.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.510
Phone numbers of people who support us,
who fund us.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.990
Who's 'us'?

26:35.040 --> 26:38.830
Me. A doctor working in desperate
circumstances with refugees in Syria.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.760
If that's true,
come with me to the police now.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.550
I'm disappointed.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.070
I thought if anyone in the West

26:48.170 --> 26:50.310
would understand what we're doing,
it would be you.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.320
Sorry, who am I talking to?

26:53.760 --> 26:55.200
Who are you?

27:02.800 --> 27:06.510
70 years ago,
the Jews made the desert bloom.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.150
Yes, they stole the land,

27:09.200 --> 27:11.190
but they built a miracle.

27:11.240 --> 27:14.150
And all the talents of their
diaspora came to help them.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.390
We're doing the same.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.550
Except we didn't steal anyone's land.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.470
Doctors, engineers, teachers,
trying to build a state,

27:22.520 --> 27:24.520
make our desert bloom.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.440
So we can live free,
according to our faith.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.470
Help us, Emma.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.960
If that was it, I would, gladly.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.870
But that's not all, is it?

27:38.920 --> 27:40.790
We are in a war.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.510
We have to fight.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.560
It's how you fight.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.590
I won't have any part of it.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.440
None.

28:15.440 --> 28:18.590
Birmingham are requesting instructions.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.640
They wait. That's the instruction.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.720
Tell me... when did you change?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.030
Or have you always been lying?

28:30.080 --> 28:32.070
When did I change?

28:32.120 --> 28:35.390
Was it the 20th child killed
by a Western bomb or the 100th?

28:35.440 --> 28:37.230
I don't know.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.270
But it becomes very clear out there...

28:40.320 --> 28:42.960
.. what is right, what is not right.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.390
God makes it clear.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.440
Please, Yusef...

28:50.520 --> 28:52.510
.. you have a family here.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.560
You have a child.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.080
I have nothing here.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.440
Do you have the SIM card with you?

29:08.680 --> 29:10.950
No.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.480
Imran.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.280
Just to get this clear,
you're firing me?

29:33.760 --> 29:35.240
Get her out.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.580
She's back on.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.310
Moseley Lane, Sparkhill,
between St Paul's and Highgate.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.310
Do we have any suspect addresses?

30:15.560 --> 30:17.150
One, 74a.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.070
Cordon the area, send the teams in.
And Banville? Pull her in?

30:20.120 --> 30:21.400
No.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.280
Yeah. Tactical team, go.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.800
Where am I? Where...?

30:49.720 --> 30:51.430
Roger that.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.440
Approaching target.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.590
Hold it.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.790
Go, go, go!

30:58.840 --> 31:01.390
Armed police! Armed police!
Down on the floor now!

31:01.440 --> 31:03.670
Police! Get down on the floor!

31:03.720 --> 31:05.720
Get down! Down, on the floor!

31:08.480 --> 31:10.950
Down! Armed police!

31:11.000 --> 31:12.550
Bravo Two, go, go, go.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.910
Armed police, get on the floor!

31:13.960 --> 31:15.950
Police, show me your hands!

31:16.000 --> 31:17.590
Show me your hands!

31:20.320 --> 31:24.310
This is Two Alpha. We have Yusef
Attar in custody, identity confirmed.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.280
Congratulations, everyone.

32:48.680 --> 32:50.770
What exactly do you want us to do?

32:50.820 --> 32:52.610
Scare the hell out of him.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.660
Hello, Tony.

33:03.860 --> 33:04.610
Argh!

33:05.660 --> 33:07.170
Urgh!

33:12.940 --> 33:14.330
I'll bloody sue you!

33:14.380 --> 33:16.090
Fine, I can recommend a solicitor.

33:16.140 --> 33:18.490
Get out. Just get out!
Who's protecting you, Tony?

33:18.540 --> 33:20.250
Who are the wankers who smashed my bike?

33:20.300 --> 33:23.050
I don't know what you're on about.
Then I'll call the press.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.090
Boy, are they itching to talk to you,
Tony.

33:25.140 --> 33:26.850
I'm not talking to you. Piss off!

33:26.900 --> 33:29.170
Then I'll put Linda's
photos back out there.

33:29.220 --> 33:31.970
And then I'll add Siobhan's, too.

33:32.020 --> 33:34.850
Now, she said you slept with her.

33:34.900 --> 33:36.930
She was intimidated into not testifying,

33:36.980 --> 33:39.530
but once the press are at the door,
she'll have to talk.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.410
And once she's outed,

33:41.460 --> 33:44.730
how long before the other girls
decide to get ahead of the story,

33:44.780 --> 33:46.780
before the story destroys them too?

33:47.980 --> 33:53.130
And then they're all gonna be talking
about some creep with a camera

33:53.180 --> 33:57.530
and a smooth mouth in Suffolk in 2003.

33:57.580 --> 33:59.570
You'd ruin their lives too?

33:59.620 --> 34:02.210
Where are your bloody ethics?
You're a lawyer.

34:02.260 --> 34:06.620
Who just saw her innocent
client walk in front of a truck.

34:07.620 --> 34:09.620
So, fuck my ethics!

34:11.820 --> 34:14.010
We just wanna know about Linda.

34:14.060 --> 34:16.130
Did you go to her or
did she come to you?

34:16.179 --> 34:18.570
She came to me.
Why?

34:18.620 --> 34:22.100
The reason I said, she wanted photos.
She wanted to be a model.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.540
Why?

34:29.659 --> 34:31.659
No idea what that is.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.489
Why did she want the photos?

34:35.540 --> 34:37.219
I told you.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.900
Right.

34:45.420 --> 34:46.929
I'll call the press.

34:46.980 --> 34:48.929
She said they were a going-away present.

34:48.980 --> 34:51.409
Who for?
Her boyfriend.

34:51.460 --> 34:54.330
Who was he? Did he work on the base?
I dunno.

34:54.380 --> 34:56.610
What was his name?
I don't know.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.650
Agh! Aargh!

34:58.700 --> 35:00.490
I still owe you for my ribs.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.010
What was his bloody name?

35:02.060 --> 35:04.010
His name?

35:07.380 --> 35:08.070
Lo...

35:09.220 --> 35:11.010
It was Logan.

35:11.060 --> 35:12.850
Logan.

35:12.900 --> 35:14.900
Where was Logan going away to?

35:15.900 --> 35:18.770
Iraq.

35:18.820 --> 35:20.820
Where'd you bloody think?

35:23.860 --> 35:25.860
What was his last name?

35:27.180 --> 35:28.650
Tony?

35:28.700 --> 35:30.410
What was his last name?

35:30.460 --> 35:33.660
I don't know.
Tony, please.

35:34.980 --> 35:38.340
His last name. Now, we can protect you.

35:40.020 --> 35:41.740
You can't.

35:42.780 --> 35:45.490
And I don't know his last name,
she never said it.

35:52.220 --> 35:55.330
We have a first name,
we know he was with an F-16 squadron

35:55.380 --> 35:57.490
and we know when he was at RAF Crawbury.

35:57.540 --> 35:59.530
We can identify him.

35:59.580 --> 36:01.650
And I know a man who can track him down.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.690
And then what?

36:03.740 --> 36:05.410
And then I'm gonna go to America

36:05.460 --> 36:07.370
and I'm gonna talk to
that son of a bitch.

36:07.420 --> 36:09.370
With your record and your clients,

36:09.420 --> 36:11.620
you think the Americans will let you in?

36:30.980 --> 36:32.850
'Passengers must clear Customs

36:32.900 --> 36:34.900
before collecting their bags.

36:58.220 --> 37:00.940
That's quite a record for a lawyer.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.100
Trespass, property damage,
resisting arrest.

37:06.340 --> 37:08.330
Assaulting a police officer.

37:08.380 --> 37:10.450
I was the one who ended up in hospital.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.500
What were you doing?

37:13.620 --> 37:17.620
Protesting against the presence of
American nuclear weapons on English soil.

37:20.100 --> 37:22.100
I was very young.

37:23.340 --> 37:25.340
And the purpose of your visit today?

37:26.660 --> 37:28.660
Er... conference on copyright law.

37:31.220 --> 37:33.290
This the hotel where you're staying?

37:33.340 --> 37:35.060
Yes.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.340
Welcome to New York.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.300
Thank you.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.890
Hey.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.940
It's me.

39:04.380 --> 39:06.380
Emma?

39:08.340 --> 39:11.170
Larry.

39:11.220 --> 39:15.730
It's a funny place to meet.
You paying your respects to someone?

39:15.780 --> 39:18.250
Sort of.

39:18.300 --> 39:19.850
What have you got?

39:19.900 --> 39:21.900
Well, I got your guy.

39:23.580 --> 39:26.050
He's National Guard now,
so easier to track.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.300
First name, Logan, last name, Bradley.

39:29.380 --> 39:32.490
In 2002, he was an airman
with the 23rd Fighter Squadron

39:32.540 --> 39:35.530
at the United States Air
Force in Suffolk, England.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.650
He looks like a child, for God's sake.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.530
He was a child, only 17.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.570
Do you think I'm wrong about this?

39:41.620 --> 39:44.170
24 hours after your
girl's disappearance,

39:44.220 --> 39:46.410
Logan was posted to Kuwait alone,

39:46.460 --> 39:48.930
two weeks ahead of his squadron.

39:48.980 --> 39:50.690
He's part of this, all right.

39:50.740 --> 39:52.250
Where is he now?

39:52.300 --> 39:56.090
He's a staff sergeant with the 114th
Air National Guard at Andrews,

39:56.140 --> 39:59.810
just outside of DC.
Even got you his home address.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.850
Larry, you're an angel.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.250
Wait till you get my invoice.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.300
It's a four-hour drive.

40:07.620 --> 40:09.330
And you better get started,

40:09.380 --> 40:11.570
because if the Military
finds out you're here,

40:11.620 --> 40:14.650
they're gonna hide Logan
in Korea or some place.

40:14.700 --> 40:16.700
And, Emma?

40:18.060 --> 40:20.060
They will find out you're here.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.630
What is it, sir?

40:41.680 --> 40:44.870
Emma Banville just got flagged
coming into the country.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.910
Did you know about this?

40:46.960 --> 40:50.270
No, sir. When?
Today.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.620
Attending some conference
on copyright law.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.390
She's not remotely
interested in copyright law.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.440
Then what's she doing here?

41:01.520 --> 41:03.510
I'll find out. Where is she staying?

41:03.560 --> 41:05.510
New York, the Marriott,

41:05.560 --> 41:08.990
according to her Customs
declaration form, anyway.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.000
Find her.

42:02.680 --> 42:06.070
What have we got?
'Do not disturb' sign on the door.

42:06.120 --> 42:09.230
Bed looks like it's been slept
in but none of the towels used.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.790
Looks like she checked
for listening devices.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.870
She is on the list of
conference attendees,

42:13.920 --> 42:16.110
but as of 30 minutes ago,
she hadn't checked in.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.370
She won't.

42:17.920 --> 42:21.120
Get me the Air Force,
Department of Personnel Management.

42:52.280 --> 42:53.870
Logan Bradley?

42:53.920 --> 42:56.390
Yes, ma'am.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.440
I want to talk about Linda Simms.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.510
Um... Linda Simms.

43:01.560 --> 43:03.560
England, 2003.

43:07.560 --> 43:08.830
Remember?

43:08.880 --> 43:11.350
Who are you, media?
I'm a lawyer.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.510
I represent the man who
spent 14 years in jail

43:13.560 --> 43:16.110
for having killed Linda Simms.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.230
I'm sorry,
I don't know anything about this.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.990
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

43:20.040 --> 43:23.270
If I leave, do you know where
I'm going next? To the police.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.510
I've got these photos and
the man who took them.

43:25.560 --> 43:29.350
I know that Linda lived near to the
airbase where you were stationed.

43:29.400 --> 43:34.390
And I know you were transferred off that
airbase 24 hours after she went missing.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.000
I know you know exactly who she is.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.670
Do you think I'd hurt that girl?

43:41.720 --> 43:43.590
Or any girl?

43:43.640 --> 43:45.640
Fine. I'm going to the police.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.030
Don't you fucking think about it.

43:49.080 --> 43:50.870
Let go of me!
Stay right there!

44:02.440 --> 44:04.430
Don't do this.

44:04.480 --> 44:07.270
I got a wife, I got a kid.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.320
Please just go.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.670
Not till you tell me what
happened between you and Linda.

44:13.720 --> 44:16.270
That's Air Force Police.
You should've gone.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.710
I'm gonna tell my story.
I don't care who I tell it to.

44:18.760 --> 44:21.270
Emma Banville?
Who wants to know?

44:21.320 --> 44:24.320
Come with us, please.
Sergeant Marcus, put her in the vehicle.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.150
What did she say to you,
Sergeant Bradley?

44:28.200 --> 44:30.230
Nothing that made any sense.
She's crazy.

44:30.280 --> 44:33.430
Stay home until you hear from me.
Don't talk to anyone, understand?

44:33.480 --> 44:35.480
Yes, sir.
