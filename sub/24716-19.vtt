I don’t know
if it’s a permanent assignment or not,

so that's what I'm gonna do.

-Andy,

00:57.515 --> 00:59.142

Heard a lot about you.

-Didn’t you just make sergeant?
-Yeah, my current assignment's downstairs.

I’m just up here working
on the lieutenant’s shooting.

01:20.663 --> 01:21.706

01:21.873 --> 01:22.916
Well, we got information

I saw you looking at the club.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.886
Should we bring you up
to speed on our cases?

I can make copies

-How’d the job come in?

Uh... It was early, I heard music coming
through the walls.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.805
I knocked on the door,
there was no answer.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.891
I... I tried the door
it was open, I went in.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.227
-How early was it?
-About eight o'clock.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.270
-How well did you know her?
-Not very well.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.315
The one thing we talked about was music
since ethnographic folk music

03:52.398 --> 03:54.025
is what I’m pursuing my doctorate in.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.944
Was it unusual for her
to be playing music?

03:56.027 --> 03:57.820
At that hour? Yes, it was.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.864
And you were going in
to ask her to turn it down?

03:59.948 --> 04:02.325
I do meditation at that hour,
and I was irritated

04:02.408 --> 04:03.826
that having it interrupted.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.828
-RITA: Was Farah married?
-Yes.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.497
Can you tell us anything
about her husband?

04:07.705 --> 04:09.874
I think he was a cab driver.
I know, he was gone a lot.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.126
Any sense if there were problems
between them?

04:12.210 --> 04:15.964
I really hate being put in the position
of commenting on something like that.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.925
-No one’s gonna quote you.
-Under that rubric, all right.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.802
I did hear arguing,

04:20.927 --> 04:22.762
though it was her husband
who did most of the yelling.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.683
-Any idea what they argued about?
-They spoke in Arabic, I have no idea.

I mean, off chance,
’cause it’s a cop shooting,

04:52.583 --> 04:55.420
if anyone expects Arnold Palmer in there
to know what’s going on,

04:55.503 --> 04:57.380

to bring him up-to-date.

-Okay.

05:04.971 --> 05:08.016

-He know her from Egypt.

He wanted to marry her
but he has no money,

07:19.856 --> 07:22.650
his family have no money,
so this doesn’t happen.

07:22.984 --> 07:27.655
Her family also have nothing.
They list her in agency.

-I make arrangements.
-What kind of arrangements?

07:30.908 --> 07:33.828

07:35.329 --> 07:38.249
I bring her here to be my wife.

Did he make contact
with her once he got here?

Yes, he does. And I have him
in my home, I show him hospitality.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.271

-No...

I... say he not welcome in my house.

I’m back downstairs.

I’m not saying they’d give it to you,
but if I made a call,

it’s a possibility.

To be a boss, to command a squad.

-You took the sergeant’s test.
-And that was probably a stupid idea.

I don’t wanna be a boss.

until I hit mandatory retirement.

I could do something else.

-More like temporary insanity.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.327
-You talk to your wife about this?
-Why?

if it weren’t for her and the kids,

10:22.163 --> 10:23.414
uh... I’d retire altogether?

10:23.789 --> 10:26.584
She starts feeling guilty
and takes my problems on herself?

-Well...

I can do for myself

is to turn toward the possibilities

I guess, that’s a good way to look at it.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.215
What gives is this.
We find your friend Yesenin

11:56.298 --> 11:58.175
based on information
that you provide us with,

11:58.300 --> 12:01.303
I recommend a suspended sentence.
We find him based on anything else,

12:01.887 --> 12:03.597
cross your fingers, hope for the best.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.226
-I already provide.
-You gave up two addresses

12:07.309 --> 12:09.228
-where no one was home.
-What, is my fault?

12:09.311 --> 12:12.189
No. The gun and the stolen merchandise
are your fault.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.358
Now you want those to go away,
you got to help us find him.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.235
I take big risk here!

12:16.318 --> 12:18.487
If you weren’t taking a risk,
we wouldn’t be talking to you.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.907
Now, either you tell us what you know
or stop wasting our time.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.454
(SIGHS) He bring girls from Russia.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.373
Even if he’s hiding,
he might go check up on them.

12:29.498 --> 12:30.624
All right,
where would we find these girls?

12:30.916 --> 12:33.586
-He don’t tell me where his girls.
-That’s not very much help, is it?

12:37.465 --> 12:40.968
I know he has deal with Coventry Hotel
where he sends girls.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.344
A deal with who at the Coventry?

12:42.720 --> 12:45.890
His name Macklin. I meet him
before Sergei, I put them together.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.643
-Is good now?
-We’ll see.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.739
-Which one of you is Ibrahim?
-Me, I’m Ibrahim.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.657
We need to talk
to you about Farah, Ibrahim.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.825
What about her?

13:04.909 --> 13:06.243
We don’t wanna have
this conversation here.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.328
Something happened to her?

13:07.453 --> 13:10.164
-When’s the last time you saw her?
-I don't remember, why?

13:10.247 --> 13:11.415
Think about it for a second.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.251
I don’t remember when it was.
Why? Why you asking me?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.212
She’s dead.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.967
How can you think I kill this woman?

13:22.551 --> 13:25.012
We don't think anything,
we’re talking to everyone who knew her.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.096
RITA: What time did you get
to work this morning?

13:26.388 --> 13:27.515
Six-thirty.

13:27.765 --> 13:31.060
-Is there anyone who can confirm that?
-It was the driver from<i> the Times.</i>

13:31.227 --> 13:33.354
And there was Sami,
who works at the newsstand.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.731
Unless you think
because he’s Arab, he’d lie.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.525
We don’t think anything like that.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.610
RITA: Did you try to persuade Farah
not to get married?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.737
-Yes.
-She went through with it though.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.865
She honored her parents,
she did what they told her to do.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.826
I was in no position
to offer what Amar could,

13:46.951 --> 13:49.161
so I had to accept it
that this is the way it was going to be.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.498
-You weren’t happy about it though.
-No, I was not happy about it.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.876
But I understand the difficulty
of her position,

13:56.001 --> 13:57.711
so I tried to be a friend only.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.630
You picked up and came
to the United States

13:59.713 --> 14:00.714
because you want to be friends with her?

14:01.090 --> 14:02.967
Come on, Ibrahim.
That’s not even vaguely credible.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.802
I came here to win her back.

14:05.386 --> 14:09.223
When I can’t do that,
I satisfy myself to be a friend only.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.393
Also to better myself
in the way that others do.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.938
Is that what the phone calls
and the visits were? Being a friend only?

14:16.063 --> 14:18.440
Yes, she needed a friend.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.403
For Amar, his most treasured possession
was his taxi medallion.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.071
Farah was a distant second.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.073
That must have made
it frustrating for you,

14:26.532 --> 14:28.325
to live with the fact that she was his.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.203
Many things are frustrating.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.749
You learn to accept them as God’s will
and go about your business.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.877
-Is that what you did?
-IBRAHIM: Yes.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.130
Think whether or not you wanna be lying
about accepting God’s will for him.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.632
LAURA: Not to mention your relationship
with a murder victim.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.093
That’s how people become suspects,
they lie.

14:52.016 --> 14:55.519
Okay. (SOBS) it happened.

14:56.103 --> 15:00.816
We don’t plan on it, but one day,
she come over and we have relations.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.235
-Was that the only time?
-Yes, on my life.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.195
When was the last time
you saw her, Ibrahim?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.490
Two days ago.
She called me in the daytime.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.950
She was sad.

15:10.784 --> 15:11.994
She was lonely.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.455
She missed her parents...

15:15.247 --> 15:18.208
her brother... her sisters.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.878
I went over there
to be whatever comfort I could.

15:20.961 --> 15:25.007
-What did that consist of?
-Drinking tea and talking, that’s all.

15:25.215 --> 15:28.010
Amar came home early and decided
it was something else entirely.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.678
-How do you know that?
-He cursed me,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.555
he made accusations about both of us.

15:31.972 --> 15:35.309
She called me the next day in tears
and said it kept up through the night.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.022
It’s Amar who did this, there is no doubt.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.732
Well, we’ll certainly be talking
to him again.

15:42.483 --> 15:46.153
When it comes time
to make burial arrangements...

15:47.988 --> 15:51.116
she should be sent back to Egypt,
to her parents.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.078
-That’s up to her husband.
-What if her husband kill her?

15:54.203 --> 15:57.539
-I’m not sure.
-IBRAHIM: If it’s possible, please.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.001
Could you tell,
whoever is in charge of that...

16:04.463 --> 16:07.299
that I would like to pay. (SOBS)

16:16.558 --> 16:18.811
-Mr. Macklin?
-What can I do for you, gentlemen?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.521
We’re looking for Sergei Yesenin.

16:20.896 --> 16:24.692
-Uh... is he a guest?
-No, he’s the pimp you work with.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.277
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.655
How loud do you want
this conversation to get?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.408
Could we talk over here?

16:32.616 --> 16:35.369
(INDISITINCT CHATTER)

16:38.747 --> 16:41.834
All kinds of people come through here,
all kinds of people drop names.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.878
If you tell us you don’t know this guy,
we’re gonna take you out in cuffs.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.048
What's going on here guys?
Is working girls going to hotel rooms

16:48.132 --> 16:49.341
something we’re cracking down on now?

16:49.466 --> 16:52.011
It’s illegal, we can crack down
on it whenever we want.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.513
Okay, sorry. Nobody told me.

16:55.055 --> 16:58.017
I’m the guy guests ask when they want one,
so I have the contacts.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.309
Now I won’t do it anymore.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.979
The girls Sergei sends over,
where does he keep them?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.814
-That, I wouldn’t know.
-All right, turn around.

17:03.939 --> 17:07.109
What, wait. They come here,
I don’t send people there.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.861
-You never got thrown a free one?
-Never.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.197
-ANDY: You’re lying, turn around.
-Can I tell you something?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.074
I don’t think you have anything
to arrest me on.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.659
Think again, Sergei shot a cop.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.453
JOHN: That means we can go
as far as we want

17:17.536 --> 17:18.912
in any direction we wanna go in.

And if you don’t think
we’re gonna tie you up for a while,

17:21.040 --> 17:23.208
you’re crazy, whether or not
we can make it stick.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.504
You know, this guy scares me to death.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.382
The sooner we lock him up,
the sooner he stops being a threat.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.552
-Is he gonna find out it comes from me?
-Not from us.

17:38.265 --> 17:41.810
There’s an apartment building
on York Avenue between 68th and 69th.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.313
He's got like a canopy,
he keeps an apartment there.

17:44.563 --> 17:48.859
-Larabie’s the name on the buzzer.
-Don’t go calling over there to warn them.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.069
What, are you crazy?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.321

-Police!
-(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

18:09.713 --> 18:11.381
-Could I speak with you, please?
-What do you want?

18:11.465 --> 18:12.758
I have a special situation.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.593
ANDY: I'm sure you do,
get him dressed, get him out of here.

There’s no one else here.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.682
-What’s your name?
-Varenka.

-Varenka what?
-Bulgarin.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.478
Varenka, we’re looking for Sergei.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.897
-I don’t know who that is.
-All right, come on, you’re taking a ride.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.649
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

18:28.732 --> 18:30.776
-She has to go to the bathroom.
-All right, take her.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.403
-No, she needs privacy.
-It’s not possible.

18:33.529 --> 18:37.116
Uh... Officer, listen my wife’s coming
out of serious depression.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.367
You think could be possible,
maybe we could get

18:38.450 --> 18:39.743
-to spare her finding out about this?
-Go.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.787
Listen, don't worry about this,
we’re not gonna call your wife.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.039
Hey, after he gets dressed,
take him downstairs.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.874
-Thank you, thank you very much!
-Don’t touch me.

-Him, you treat good.
-Come on, Natasha.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.571
-Hope we’re not interrupting.
-It’s all right.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.532
-This is where you come to pray?
-This is where I come most days

19:18.615 --> 19:19.950
when I’m working.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.411
And I can’t get
to the mosque up on 96th street.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.666
I came today to forget
it’s not like most days.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.127
We spoke to Ibrahim.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.837
-Did he admit to killing her?
-No.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.381
You said the last time
you saw him was a month ago.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.968
-Something like this, yes.
-He said it was two days ago.

19:38.468 --> 19:41.346
He said you came home,
found him there, and got pretty angry.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.432
You accused him and your wife
of having an affair.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.143
It’s true.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.437
You’re gonna have
to come with us now, Mr. Amar.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.647
-Why?
-'Cause we wanna talk to you some more.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.733
I don’t want to talk to you anymore.

Please give me consideration
to allow me to be by myself.

But you’re working for Sergei.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.048
-I don’t know who this is.
-Who do you work for?

20:16.673 --> 20:17.925
I don’t work for anyone.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.385
-Do you have an ad in the paper?
-No, I don’t have ad.

You stand on the street corner?

20:23.764 --> 20:24.890

who pay to have sex with you?

and they call.

I can have immigration here,

20:40.697 --> 20:42.824
and you can find yourself
getting sent back to Russia.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.035
-Why do you do this to me?
-’Cause you’re lying.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.204
Now, I know you’re afraid of Sergei.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.957
But if you tell us where we can find him,
he’ll never know it came from you.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.834
I don’t know who this is. (SOBS)

20:53.669 --> 20:55.462

20:55.587 --> 20:57.506
When is the last time you saw him, Panya?

20:57.631 --> 20:59.341
I don’t know who it is, Sergei.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.219
-Yeah, you do.
-You think because I’m from Ukraine?

21:02.302 --> 21:05.013
-No, I think because he’s your pimp.
-I don’t know who this is.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.473
You were arrested for prostitution.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.767
That means you’re gonna go to jail,
and when you come out of jail,

21:08.850 --> 21:11.353
you’re gonna be shipped back
to the Ukraine, is that what you want?

21:11.561 --> 21:12.729
For sure I don’t want.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.315
-Then tell me where I can find Sergei.
-I don’t know Sergei.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.651
We’ll protect you.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.904
My mother and my brother in Odessa,
you’ll protect them, too?

21:22.531 --> 21:24.324
I don’t know Sergei.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.994
See, the girls might get off
with a slap on the wrist.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.996
-You’re not gonna get off so easy.
-VARENKA: No?

21:29.121 --> 21:32.708
You’re going up on pandering charges.
If we find out you had anything to do

21:32.833 --> 21:34.501
with bringing these girls
into the country,

21:34.668 --> 21:36.920
you might be looking
at unlawful imprisonment,

21:37.045 --> 21:39.923
smuggling, federal racketeering,
all kinds of things.

21:40.215 --> 21:43.969
I am such big fish like this,
maybe they build me my own prison.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.681
-No, they got the prison already.
-You don’t scare me, okay?

21:48.181 --> 21:50.100
Which makes you more stupid than brave,

21:50.183 --> 21:53.020
because this guy
you’re protecting shot a cop.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.023
That means if you help us find him,
you can walk out of here.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.567
I don’t help you do nothing.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.447
Thought you might wanna get an update

22:03.572 --> 22:05.157
on where we are
with the lieutenant’s shooting.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.575
Sure, come on in.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.452
I’m just trying to get this thing to work.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.496
-Oh, yeah.
-Give me the barometric pressure,

22:11.621 --> 22:15.334
temperature, and dew point,
and if I knew how to set the darn thing,

22:15.417 --> 22:17.044
it’d give me the phases of the moon.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.547
Turns out the shooter
does a brisk business in the pimp trade.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.008
We hit an apartment,
took in a few of his girls.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.885
-This is a Russian?
-Yeah.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.804
You know Vinnie Greco
over at the first dep’s office?

22:28.263 --> 22:29.848
-No.
-I knew him out at the one-eleven,

22:29.973 --> 22:32.017
he... he owned a Russian car.

22:33.143 --> 22:36.521
Chances are we’re probably gonna have
to sit on this apartment

22:36.688 --> 22:39.608
-and his sister’s place in Rego Park.
-Called a ZiL.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.861
-What is?
-The Russian car,

22:42.986 --> 22:45.447
they make a car called the ZiL.
That’s the car Vinnie bought.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.366
Huh, anyway, you were saying?

22:47.616 --> 22:50.243
Just that there might be
some overtime involved.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.329
Well, as long as you got
the paperwork to back it up.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.331
And we’re talking
about a cop getting shot, right?

22:54.498 --> 22:56.166
-Right.
-Knock yourself out.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.418
-You were looking for me?
-Yeah, uh...

22:58.543 --> 23:00.504
could you see if we have
any double-A batteries?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.714
-Sure.
-You're Bruce, right?

-John.
-John, sorry.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

23:10.180 --> 23:12.391
-I’ll keep you posted.
-That sounds good.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.522
What do you want me to do about the 61s?
I have a feeling our new lieutenant

23:18.605 --> 23:21.316
-doesn’t wanna be bothered with them.
-Just leave them with me.

-(INHALES)

23:31.118 --> 23:33.286
I guess, I just don’t see
this place as one big Lego set

23:33.370 --> 23:34.579
where people are interchangeable.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.254
John... people move around, people retire.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.506
It’s not all that unusual
what’s happening.

23:44.756 --> 23:45.757
I know.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.635
I always make the mistake
of getting overly attached.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.262
Believe me, it’s not the first time.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.057
There’ll be some new faces around,
you might learn to like them.

Seeing you go...

23:57.394 --> 23:58.728
seeing Detective Medavoy go...

23:59.521 --> 24:01.857
having this new lieutenant
who I have to say, I do not care for...

24:02.858 --> 24:03.942
-is too hard.
-John...

24:04.067 --> 24:05.902
I know people move around,
I know people retire.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.905
There’s just something
about this place and these people.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.616
Or maybe it’s...

24:11.700 --> 24:14.119
the particular time in my life
when I was here.

24:15.704 --> 24:16.746
Whatever it is...

24:17.247 --> 24:19.541
I don’t want to sit at that desk out there
if it’s all gonna be different.

What are you gonna do?

24:22.502 --> 24:23.628
Put in for a transfer.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.756
Cross my fingers there’s another precinct
somewhere in the city

24:26.882 --> 24:29.634
where I’ll be made to feel
as much a part of things as I was here.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.098
And hope I don’t get too weepy
thinking about it. (SOBS)

24:49.529 --> 24:51.573
How come you couldn’t meet a girl
here in New York?

24:52.157 --> 24:54.868
-I wanted a Muslim girl.
-LAURA: There’s Muslim girls here.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.496
It’s not your business why I do this.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.581
Unfortunately,
it is our business, Mr. Amar.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.042
We’re detectives
investigating your wife’s murder.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.962
I wanted a woman
who follow <i>Quran </i>teachings.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.758
-Such as what?
-That she be clean, that she wear hijab.

25:10.550 --> 25:14.262
That she not... give herself
to anyone but her husband.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.848
And you paid a lot of money
to have that, didn’t you?

25:17.057 --> 25:18.558
I don’t think about the money.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.144
Hmm, the flag had to drop
on that meter a lot of times

25:21.269 --> 25:23.021
for you to make enough money
to bring her over here.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.397
Did you feel like
you might have been gypped?

25:24.481 --> 25:25.524
Why would I feel this way?

25:25.690 --> 25:26.900
She wasn’t who you thought
you were getting.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.819
She wanted friends of her own,
she missed her parents.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.531
Maybe she wanted to leave
the apartment without the hijab.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.449
She never go out without her hijab.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.201
LAURA: Maybe she didn’t want children,
Mr. Amar.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.621
-Maybe she wouldn’t have sex with you.
-Don't speak of these things.

25:39.704 --> 25:42.499
And maybe you found out
that she’d given herself to another.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.000
You think all women are like you?

25:44.167 --> 25:47.712
Unable to resist temptation,
unable to remain clean

25:47.879 --> 25:49.839
even if the world around them is unclean?

25:49.965 --> 25:52.300
She was unclean herself.
In your mind, at least.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.010
She had given herself to another.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.972
And as bad as she might have felt,
there was no undoing that.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.807
Maybe she didn’t feel bad enough.

25:59.766 --> 26:02.143
Maybe she didn’t feel bad at all.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.357
I don’t say anything else to you.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.484
I don’t talk to you anymore.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.951

26:18.868 --> 26:20.870

in honor of Greg’s retirement.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.956
-Wow.
-What, did you finish the Kung Pao?

26:23.248 --> 26:25.083
There’s a whole other thing
of it over there.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.419
LAURA: Brigid coming to your racket, Greg?

26:27.961 --> 26:29.838
GREG: She wouldn’t miss it
for all the rice in China.

-GREG: Yeah.

-Your prints came back.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.211

give your brother up to save yourself,

27:16.092 --> 27:17.510
so let’s try another reason.

27:17.677 --> 27:20.805
Us going to pick him up is his
best shot at coming out alive.

but I actually prefer

27:26.478 --> 27:30.148
-not killing someone I’m going to arrest.
-I do find hard to believe.

There’s cops all
over the city looking for him.

to stay hidden forever.

the same thing’s gonna happen
that happened last time.

to talk him into surrendering peacefully.

we’re gonna do everything
we can to avoid hurting him.

who wound up following her over here.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.211
-Uh-huh.
-RITA: They wound up having an affair,

34:48.294 --> 34:50.922
the husband found out. And whether
because of guilt or depression

34:51.089 --> 34:53.883
or some combination of the two,
she killed herself.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.385
Oh that’s... that’s a lot of detail now.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.265
Yeah, it’s just that we feel
confident it’s a suicide

35:01.390 --> 35:03.601
because there’s a journal entry
in the girl’s handwriting

35:03.684 --> 35:05.853
that intelligence just
translated as a suicide note.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.815
The M.E.’s office said the knife wounds
could be self-inflicted.

35:09.982 --> 35:11.859
-Do you have this covered?
-Yeah.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.987
Then that’s all I need.
I’m a big-picture guy.

what, why, and how.

That’s how I operate.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.080
All right.

Now, you understand,
we don’t need you to say anything.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.003
The lieutenant picked you out
from photographs,

35:31.087 --> 35:33.172
and the DA has everything
they need to go to trial.

"pick me out"?

35:43.349 --> 35:46.144
He looked at your picture and said,
"that’s the man who shot me."

a round without even meaning to.

you gotta say it.

What if I don’t know he is police?

36:13.629 --> 36:14.672
Who did you think he was?

36:15.673 --> 36:17.717
I have all kinds enemies in this country.

36:18.759 --> 36:19.760
Okay.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.638
So what? You open a door,
you see a guy with a gun,

36:22.722 --> 36:23.723
you figure he’s one of them?

36:26.893 --> 36:28.978
-Why not?
-And that’s why you shot him?

36:30.146 --> 36:31.272
A 100 percent.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.817
You’re gonna have

-(CHUCKLES) Medavoy might.

Oh, Medavoy would definitely notice.

but most of what I learned
about being a detective,

I learned from you.

37:33.042 --> 37:36.295
And I’m gonna miss
being in that car with you.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.589
I’m gonna miss you dumping
all the paperwork off on me.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.669
to Lieutenant Bale
being on pain medication,

38:58.753 --> 39:02.214
but I got a call from him
recommending you take over the squad.

39:02.631 --> 39:03.716
You know anything about that?

Yeah, Chief. I asked him to make the call.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.804
-You asked him?
-He offered

39:08.929 --> 39:10.473

Don’t get me wrong, Andy.
You’re a great detective.

That doesn’t mean
you’re ready to be a CO.

I guess that’s an evaluation
you’ll make for yourself, sir.

Okay.

39:28.282 --> 39:29.533
It ain’t gonna happen.

I mean I don’t get it,
what the hell was Bale thinking?

39:36.916 --> 39:38.918
Maybe he thought I’d make a decent boss.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.836
I’d make a decent
head coach for the Giants,

39:40.920 --> 39:42.421

for the job.

Right, but it takes something
out of them.

Instead of focusing
on working their cases,

they’re thinking more
about where they stand with the new guy.
