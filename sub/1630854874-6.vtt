WEBVTT

00:31.831 --> 00:32.966
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:32.966 --> 00:34.401
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.401 --> 00:36.269
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS SO MUCH

00:36.269 --> 00:38.571
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.571 --> 00:39.973
AND LOOK, I KNOW I NORMALLY SAY

00:39.973 --> 00:40.607
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK, BUT TO BE

00:40.607 --> 00:41.908
HONEST, THIS ONE'S BEEN A BIT

00:41.908 --> 00:42.108
SLOW.

00:42.108 --> 00:45.211
A NEW STUDY SUGGESTED THAT

00:45.211 --> 00:46.413
T-REXES HAD LIPS, THE SOAP OPERA

00:46.413 --> 00:47.781
"THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS"

00:47.781 --> 00:48.982
CELEBRATED 50 YEARS ON

00:48.982 --> 00:49.949
TELEVISION, DONALD TRUMP BECAME

00:49.949 --> 00:51.418
THE FIRST-EVER FORMER PRESIDENT

00:51.418 --> 00:52.419
TO BE INDICTED ON CRIMINAL

00:52.419 --> 00:54.521
CHARGES, AND A PHOTO OF THE POPE

00:54.521 --> 00:56.389
WEARING A BIG, POOFY JACKET WENT

00:56.389 --> 00:57.824
VIRAL BEFORE IT WAS REVEALED TO

00:57.824 --> 00:58.625
BE FAKE.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.226
SO, PRETTY QUIET IN GENERAL.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.695
AND LOOK, I'D TALK MORE ABOUT

01:02.695 --> 01:04.230
THE TRUMP INDICTMENT IF WE EVEN

01:04.230 --> 01:05.865
KNEW WHAT THE EXACT CHARGES WERE

01:05.865 --> 01:07.233
RIGHT NOW, BUT WE DON'T.

01:07.233 --> 01:07.967
SO INSTEAD, LET'S START WITH

01:07.967 --> 01:09.469
FRANCE.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.738
EUROPE'S HIGH SCHOOL BULLY.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.672
FOR WEEKS NOW, FRANCE HAS BEEN

01:12.672 --> 01:15.275
IN TURMOIL.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.777
FIRES ACROSS FRANCE.

01:17.777 --> 01:19.846
ONE PROTESTER TELLING US, "THIS

01:19.846 --> 01:20.513
IS A WAR."

01:20.513 --> 01:22.949
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TAKING TO

01:22.949 --> 01:23.450
THE STREETS.

01:23.450 --> 01:24.951
THE HISTORIC UNREST SPARKED BY

01:24.951 --> 01:26.653
PRESIDENT MACRON'S PLAN TO RAISE

01:26.653 --> 01:28.988
THE RETIREMENT AGE FROM 62 TO

01:28.988 --> 01:30.590
64, RAMMING THE MEASURES THROUGH

01:30.590 --> 01:31.825
HIS COUNTRY'S LEGISLATURE

01:31.825 --> 01:33.793
WITHOUT A VOTE.

01:33.793 --> 01:34.894
IN PARIS WHERE BINS AND

01:34.894 --> 01:37.197
NEWSPAPER KIOSKS HAVE BEEN SET

01:37.197 --> 01:37.931
ALIGHT SOME FIREFIGHTERS PUT OUT

01:37.931 --> 01:40.600
THE FLAMES.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.001
OTHERS JOINED IN WITH THE

01:42.001 --> 01:47.607
PROTESTERS.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.908
IT'S TRUE, PEOPLE ARE

01:48.908 --> 01:49.609
SO PISSED AT WHAT MACRON'S BEEN

01:49.609 --> 01:50.176
DOING THAT FIREFIGHTERS HAVE

01:50.176 --> 01:51.711
STARTED SIDING WITH FIRE INSTEAD

01:51.711 --> 01:53.680
OF HIM.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.848
AND IT'S HONESTLY KIND OF

01:54.848 --> 01:57.650
JARRING TO SEE FIRES IN PARIS

01:57.650 --> 01:58.218
THAT WERE STARTED BY SOMETHING

01:59.452 --> 02:00.787
THE EXPLOSIVE HEAT GENERATED BY

02:00.787 --> 02:02.555
INA AND JEFFREY'S RELENTLESS

02:02.555 --> 02:03.089
FUCKING AT THEIR PARISIAN

02:03.089 --> 02:05.458
APARTMENT.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.593
NOW, MACRON CLAIMS THAT WITHOUT

02:06.593 --> 02:07.927
THIS MOVE-- WHICH, REMEMBER,

02:07.927 --> 02:09.863
HE'S PUSHED THROUGH WITHOUT A

02:09.863 --> 02:10.930
VOTE-- THE GOVERNMENT WILL

02:10.930 --> 02:11.965
ACCRUE MASSIVE DEFICITS.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.366
BUT HIS OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT

02:13.366 --> 02:14.467
PENSION FUNDING CAN COME FROM

02:14.467 --> 02:15.768
OTHER SOURCES, LIKE RAISING

02:15.768 --> 02:17.036
TAXES ON THE WEALTHY.

02:17.036 --> 02:19.339
AND LOOK, A RETIREMENT AGE OF

02:19.339 --> 02:20.707
62 IS LOW, EVEN BY THE STANDARDS

02:20.707 --> 02:22.308
OF WESTERN NATIONS.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.676
IN GERMANY, THE COMPARABLE

02:23.676 --> 02:25.378
RETIREMENT AGE IS 65.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.813
IN ITALY, IT'S 67.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.214
AND IN THE U.S., THE RETIREMENT

02:28.214 --> 02:31.951
AGE IS "NO."

02:31.951 --> 02:33.520
SO FRANCE IS LUCKY TO HAVE THE

02:33.520 --> 02:35.355
KIND OF BOLD SOCIAL WELFARE

02:35.355 --> 02:36.122
POLICY THAT'S GETTING RARER

02:36.122 --> 02:36.422
NOWADAYS.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.024
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY'RE

02:38.024 --> 02:39.993
FIGHTING SO HARD TO PROTECT IT.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.828
AND I WILL SAY THESE PROTESTS

02:41.828 --> 02:43.496
HAVE BROUGHT OUT MOMENTS THAT

02:43.496 --> 02:44.030
ARE JUST QUINTESSENTIALLY

02:44.030 --> 02:44.898
FRENCH.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.566
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIRAL

02:46.566 --> 02:47.634
VIDEO FROM FRANCE.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.636
DINERS IN THE CITY OF BORDEAUX

02:49.636 --> 02:51.404
UNFAZED BY DEMONSTRATORS

02:51.404 --> 02:52.906
PROTESTING AGAINST RECENT

02:52.906 --> 02:54.874
CHANGES TO THE RETIREMENT AGE.

02:54.874 --> 02:56.743
EVEN WITH A RAGING FIRE NEARBY,

02:56.743 --> 02:58.411
THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL MANAGING

02:58.411 --> 02:59.546
TO ENJOY THEIR WINE AND

02:59.546 --> 03:03.449
CONVERSATION AT AN OUTDOOR CAFE.

03:03.449 --> 03:04.951
WOW, THAT IS ON-BRAND.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.719
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT,

03:06.719 --> 03:07.921
AFTER A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST, THE

03:07.921 --> 03:08.988
ONLY CREATURES LEFT STANDING

03:08.988 --> 03:11.224
WILL BE COCKROACHES AND AN

03:11.224 --> 03:12.158
OUTLANDISHLY RELAXED,

03:12.158 --> 03:13.560
WINE-SIPPING FRENCH COUPLE

03:13.560 --> 03:15.295
ENTIRELY UNFAZED BY THE

03:15.295 --> 03:17.397
OBLITERATION OF SOCIETY.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.032
AND THE PROTESTORS THEMSELVES

03:19.032 --> 03:25.371
HAVE SOMETIMES BORDERED ON

03:25.371 --> 03:25.872
MAGNIFICENT SELF-PARODY.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.206
[CHANTING IN A NON-ENGLISH

03:27.206 --> 03:33.813
LANGUAGE]

03:39.285 --> 03:41.020
HOLY SHIT.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.089
SOMEONE CALL UN AMBULANCE.

03:43.089 --> 03:44.090
I THINK I JUST OVERDOSED ON

03:44.090 --> 03:46.593
FRENCHNESS.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.528
THAT'S HONESTLY INTIMIDATING TO

03:48.528 --> 03:52.632
WATCH, BECAUSE SHE'S DOING

03:52.632 --> 03:55.134
EVERYTHING THAT I CAN'T DO.

03:55.134 --> 03:56.603
DANCE, LOOK COOL IN SUNGLASSES,

03:56.603 --> 03:57.036
AND ROCK BANGS.

03:57.036 --> 03:57.637
LITERALLY NOTHING SHE'S DOING

03:57.637 --> 03:58.304
THERE WILL EVER BE POSSIBLE FOR

03:58.304 --> 03:59.906
ME AND IT MAKES ME A LITTLE SAD.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.074
NOW, FRANCE'S CONSTITUTIONAL

04:01.074 --> 04:02.141
COUNCIL IS EXPECTED TO RULE ON

04:02.141 --> 04:03.409
MACRON'S PLAN ON APRIL 14.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.877
BUT HE DOESN'T APPEAR WILLING TO

04:04.877 --> 04:06.980
BACK DOWN IN THE MEANTIME, AS

04:06.980 --> 04:08.181
EVEN THE ONE CONCESSION HIS

04:08.181 --> 04:09.515
GOVERNMENT MADE TO PROTESTORS

04:09.515 --> 04:10.817
WAS PRETTY INSULTING.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.352
THE GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED TO

04:12.352 --> 04:13.720
DIALOGUE, BUT NOT ANY KIND OF

04:13.720 --> 04:15.021
DIALOGUE ABOUT DOING A U-TURN ON

04:15.021 --> 04:16.222
THE POLICY.

04:16.222 --> 04:17.557
THAT, THEY SAY, IS SIMPLY NOT

04:17.557 --> 04:19.092
GOING TO HAPPEN.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.226
HOLD ON, "WE'RE OPEN TO

04:20.226 --> 04:21.728
A DIALOGUE, JUST NOT THE KIND

04:21.728 --> 04:22.595
YOU WANT."

04:22.595 --> 04:23.596
SO WHAT WOULD YOU EVEN TALK

04:23.596 --> 04:25.798
ABOUT?

04:25.798 --> 04:27.166
"SANK YOU PROTESTOURHS FOR

04:27.166 --> 04:28.701
AGREEING TO MEET WIZ ME.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.336
DO YOU THINK SOUP AND STEW OURH

04:30.336 --> 04:31.771
DIFFERAHNT THINGZ?

04:31.771 --> 04:36.809
OR NON?"

04:36.809 --> 04:37.910
THE POINT IS, MACRON MAY NEED TO

04:37.910 --> 04:39.412
RETHINK HIS STRATEGY HERE.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.613
BECAUSE THESE PROTESTORS AREN'T

04:40.613 --> 04:41.948
GOING TO BACK DOWN ANY TIME

04:41.948 --> 04:42.715
SOON.

04:42.715 --> 04:44.083
THE FRENCH PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY

04:44.083 --> 04:45.184
GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR THEIR

04:45.184 --> 04:45.785
QUALITY OF LIFE.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.320
AND IF THIS WEEK IS ANY

04:47.320 --> 04:48.388
INDICATION, THEY'RE GOING TO

04:48.388 --> 04:49.622
LOOK PRETTY FUCKING COOL WHILE

04:49.622 --> 04:51.190
THEY DO IT.

04:51.190 --> 04:55.962
AND NOW, THIS.

04:55.962 --> 05:00.033
AND NOW...

05:00.033 --> 05:02.101
THE LAST RIVER OF MORALITY IN

05:02.101 --> 05:03.936
TUCKER CARLSON'S HAD TRIED TO

05:03.936 --> 05:04.937
GIVE HIM ADVICE.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.339
SPEAK ON THE LEFT DOESN'T WANT

05:06.339 --> 05:08.908
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR HAVE THE

05:08.908 --> 05:09.242
CONVERSATION.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.511
IT'S DECLARE THE CURRENT

05:11.511 --> 05:13.212
SYSTEM IS GREAT.

05:13.212 --> 05:14.147
NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THE

05:14.147 --> 05:14.380
DEBATE.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.749
HEY, CRAZY PEOPLE, WHAT ARE

05:16.749 --> 05:20.319
YOU TEACHING MY CHILDREN?

05:20.319 --> 05:23.289
AND OTHER WORDS, SHUT UP

05:23.289 --> 05:24.057
RACISTS.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.993
SHUT UP, RACISTS.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.961
SHUT UP RACISTS.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.630
THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME

05:30.630 --> 05:30.830
FROM.

05:30.830 --> 05:35.368
SHUT UP, RACISTS.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.235
DIVERSITY, RACISM, DIVERSITY,

05:36.235 --> 05:38.304
SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP.

05:38.304 --> 05:44.043
SHUT UP, RACISTS.

05:44.043 --> 05:44.911
Diversity, racism, diversity,

05:44.911 --> 05:47.780
SHUT UP, RACISTS.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.649
OKAY.

05:49.649 --> 05:50.083
MOVING ON.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.319
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

05:53.319 --> 05:53.853
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT-- A

05:53.853 --> 05:54.654
PUNISHMENT INFLICTED ON

05:54.654 --> 05:55.655
PRISONERS, PET GOLDFISH, AND OF

05:55.655 --> 05:56.189
COURSE LANCE ARMSTRONG'S

05:56.189 --> 05:58.057
REMAINING TESTICLE.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.292
IT'S IN THERE ALL BY ITSELF!

05:59.292 --> 06:01.060
IT MUST BE SO LONELY.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.162
MOST OF US HAVE A GENERAL IDEA

06:03.162 --> 06:04.397
OF WHAT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS,

06:04.397 --> 06:05.064
ALTHOUGH, AS THIS TIK TOK

06:05.064 --> 06:06.799
MAN-ON-THE-STREET INTERVIEW

06:06.799 --> 06:07.400
DEMONSTRATES, OTHERS SEEM A

06:07.400 --> 06:08.801
LITTLE UNSURE.

06:08.801 --> 06:09.969
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, HOW

06:09.969 --> 06:11.137
MANY PRISONERS ARE IN EACH CELL?

06:11.137 --> 06:12.772
ONE.

06:12.772 --> 06:13.673
WAIT--

06:13.673 --> 06:14.207
HE'S ALONE RIGHT?

06:14.207 --> 06:14.574
YEAH!

06:14.574 --> 06:15.208
IT'S ALONE.

06:15.208 --> 06:15.575
ONE.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.175
IT'S GOTTA BE ONE.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.176
I'M GONNA SAY-- I'M GONNA GO

06:17.176 --> 06:17.443
WITH ONE.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.377
ONE.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.045
FINAL ANSWER.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.146
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.615
YES!

06:22.615 --> 06:22.949
OKAY.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.117
I'M GLAD THEY GOT IT RIGHT, BUT

06:24.117 --> 06:25.718
IT TOOK THEM AN ALARMING AMOUNT

06:25.718 --> 06:26.719
OF TIME TO TRIPLE-TEAM THAT

06:26.719 --> 06:28.588
ANSWER.

06:28.588 --> 06:29.756
ALTHOUGH THAT DID GIVE ME A

06:29.756 --> 06:32.258
CHANCE TO ABSORB EVERY FASHION

06:32.258 --> 06:32.692
CHOICE THERE.

06:32.692 --> 06:33.726
BECAUSE YOU'D THINK THE BOLDEST

06:33.726 --> 06:35.161
ONE WOULD BE THIS KID WEARING

06:35.161 --> 06:37.230
LIGHT BLUE CROCS WITH A

06:37.230 --> 06:38.531
VIRGINITY ROCKS T-SHIRT, BUT

06:38.531 --> 06:39.999
THEN YOU'D BE IGNORING THAT THIS

06:39.999 --> 06:42.101
ONE'S WEARING HASHTAG SHOES,

06:42.101 --> 06:43.703
THIS ONE'S OUTFIT IS SOMEHOW

06:43.703 --> 06:45.605
BOTH TOO FORMAL AND TOO CASUAL,

06:45.605 --> 06:46.839
AND THIS ONE SEEMINGLY COULDN'T

06:46.839 --> 06:48.407
DECIDE IF HE WAS DRESSING FOR

06:48.407 --> 06:49.942
THE POOL OR GOLF, SO DECIDED ON

06:49.942 --> 06:51.110
BOTH.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.578
VERY BASICALLY EVERY ONE OF

06:52.578 --> 06:54.614
THESE HUMAN RED SOLO CUPS IS

06:54.614 --> 06:57.583
DRESSED INEXCUSABLY WRONG IN

06:57.583 --> 06:58.417
THEIR OWN UNIQUE WAY.

06:58.417 --> 06:58.951
I'M GENUINELY GLAD THEY ALL

06:58.951 --> 06:59.919
FOUND EACH OTHER AND I HOPE TO

06:59.919 --> 07:01.287
NEVER MEET ANY OF THEM UNDER ANY

07:01.287 --> 07:02.789
CIRCUMSTANCES.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.891
THE POINT IS, SOLITARY

07:04.891 --> 07:06.392
CONFINEMENT IS A COMMON ENOUGH

07:06.392 --> 07:08.761
PRACTICE THAT EVEN THOSE BROS

07:08.761 --> 07:09.996
BASICALLY KNOW ABOUT IT.

07:09.996 --> 07:10.797
AND THE FACT IS, IN THIS

07:10.797 --> 07:12.698
COUNTRY, FACILITIES FROM JAILS

07:12.698 --> 07:14.066
AND PRISONS TO IMMIGRATION

07:14.066 --> 07:15.668
DETENTION CENTERS ISOLATE A

07:15.668 --> 07:17.770
MASSIVE NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.872
A 2016 DOJ REPORT FOUND THAT ON

07:19.872 --> 07:21.340
ANY GIVEN DAY, AN ESTIMATED

07:21.340 --> 07:24.577
90,000 INMATES IN PRISON AND

07:24.577 --> 07:26.779
JAIL ARE HOUSED IN ISOLATION.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.047
AND THAT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY AN

07:28.047 --> 07:30.449
UNDERCOUNT, GIVEN HOW POOR DATA

07:30.449 --> 07:31.417
COLLECTION ON THIS IS.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.686
YET, FOR HOW WIDESPREAD OUR USE

07:33.686 --> 07:35.021
OF SOLITARY IS, SOME OF THOSE IN

07:35.021 --> 07:36.389
CHARGE OF OUR PRISON SYSTEMS

07:36.389 --> 07:37.723
HAVE BEEN WEIRDLY IGNORANT ON

07:37.723 --> 07:38.825
THE PRACTICALITIES OF IT.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.227
TAKE THIS AMAZING EXCHANGE FROM

07:41.227 --> 07:42.361
2014, WHERE THEN-SENATOR

07:42.361 --> 07:44.130
AL FRANKEN ASKED THE THEN-HEAD

07:44.130 --> 07:45.698
OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS

07:45.698 --> 07:48.367
A PRETTY SIMPLE QUESTION.

07:48.367 --> 07:51.037
HOW BIG IS A CELL?

07:51.037 --> 07:54.540
HOW BIG IS THE AVERAGE CELL IN

07:54.540 --> 07:55.308
SOLITARY?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.844
YOU SAY THE AVERAGE SIZE?

07:57.844 --> 07:58.878
CELL, YEAH, THE SIZE OF THE

07:58.878 --> 07:59.278
CELL.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.581
HOW BIG IS IT?

08:01.581 --> 08:02.715
WHAT IS-- I'M TRYING TO GET

08:02.715 --> 08:04.650
THIS-- THIS IS A HUMAN THING

08:04.650 --> 08:05.952
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:05.952 --> 08:06.986
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF STATISTICS.

08:06.986 --> 08:11.190
HOW BIG IS THE CELL?

08:11.190 --> 08:13.359
THE-- THE AVERAGE SIZE OF A

08:13.359 --> 08:16.929
CELL IS-- I GUESS I'M TRYING TO

08:16.929 --> 08:19.765
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE SPACE

08:19.765 --> 08:21.500
OF WHAT THE--

08:21.500 --> 08:26.305
YES, THE DIMENSIONS IN FEET

08:26.305 --> 08:28.241
AND INCHES.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.309
THE SIZE OF THE CELL THAT A

08:30.309 --> 08:32.712
PERSON IS KEPT IN.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.881
I WANT TO GET SOME IDEA OF-- I

08:34.881 --> 08:36.115
DON'T KNOW-- AM I ASKING THIS

08:36.115 --> 08:37.717
WRONG?

08:37.717 --> 08:46.859
NO!

08:46.859 --> 08:47.393
NO, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY NOT!

08:47.393 --> 08:47.994
AND HONESTLY, I WISH HE'D KEPT

08:47.994 --> 08:48.394
GOING.

08:48.394 --> 08:48.995
"OKAY, CLEARLY YOU'RE CONFUSED

08:48.995 --> 08:49.495
BY FEET AND INCHES.

08:49.495 --> 08:49.896
HOW ABOUT METERS?

08:49.896 --> 08:50.229
OR STEPS?

08:50.229 --> 08:51.130
IF YOU STOOD AT ONE END OF THE

08:51.130 --> 08:52.098
CELL, HOW MANY STEPS WOULD IT

08:52.098 --> 08:52.698
TAKE TO WALK TO THE OTHER END?

08:52.698 --> 08:53.199
NO?

08:53.199 --> 08:53.799
HOW MANY RABBITS COULD YOU FIT

08:53.799 --> 08:54.634
ON THE FLOOR OF ONE OF THOSE

08:54.634 --> 08:55.668
CELLS?

08:55.668 --> 08:56.269
HOW MANY RABBITS BIG IS ONE

08:56.269 --> 08:56.669
CELL?

08:56.669 --> 08:58.170
AM I ASKING THIS WRONG?

08:58.170 --> 08:59.272
BECAUSE THERE ARE LITERALLY NO

08:59.272 --> 09:00.039
OTHER WAYS TO ASK THIS

09:00.039 --> 09:02.074
QUESTION."

09:02.074 --> 09:04.110
FOR THE RECORD, THE AVERAGE SIZE

09:04.110 --> 09:06.312
OF A SOLITARY CELL IS 6 FEET BY

09:06.312 --> 09:08.180
9 FEET, WHICH IS WAY TOO SMALL

09:08.180 --> 09:10.216
FOR A PERSON TO BE STUCK IN FOR

09:10.216 --> 09:10.783
DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, OR EVEN

09:10.783 --> 09:13.452
YEARS ON END.

09:13.452 --> 09:15.354
THAT LEVEL OF ISOLATION IS WHY

09:15.354 --> 09:17.156
IN 2011, THE UNITED NATIONS

09:17.156 --> 09:18.391
SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON TORTURE

09:18.391 --> 09:19.692
DECLARED THAT, CONSIDERING THE

09:19.692 --> 09:22.061
SEVERE PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT

09:22.061 --> 09:23.462
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CAN CAUSE,

09:23.462 --> 09:24.597
IT CAN AMOUNT TO TORTURE.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.032
THEY THEN CALLED ON ALL

09:26.032 --> 09:27.133
COUNTRIES TO PROHIBIT INDEFINITE

09:27.133 --> 09:28.868
AND PROLONGED SOLITARY

09:28.868 --> 09:30.102
CONFINEMENT IN EXCESS OF 15

09:30.102 --> 09:31.470
DAYS.

09:31.470 --> 09:34.540
WHICH REALLY ISN'T ASKING THAT

09:34.540 --> 09:35.641
MUCH, BUT IS ALSO SOMETHING

09:35.641 --> 09:36.976
THAT WE IN THE U.S. HAVE, TO PUT

09:36.976 --> 09:39.245
IT MILDLY, NOT DONE.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.947
WHICH IS APPALLING, AS SOLITARY

09:40.947 --> 09:43.582
REALLY TAKES ITS TOLL ON PEOPLE

09:43.582 --> 09:44.383
AS SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY

09:44.383 --> 09:45.785
EXPERIENCED IT CAN TELL YOU.

09:45.785 --> 09:46.452
ASK YOURSELF, CAN YOU LIVE IN

09:46.452 --> 09:49.588
A BATHROOM FOR 10 YEARS?

09:49.588 --> 09:51.757
IT'S BAD TO LOCK AN INDIVIDUAL

09:51.757 --> 09:53.592
UP AND JUST PUT HIM IN A-- IN A

09:53.592 --> 09:57.330
ROOM, CLOSED, NOTHING TO DO.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.030
IT'S, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY,

09:58.030 --> 09:59.632
INHUMANE.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.635
AND I KNOW, "WE'RE INMATES AND

10:02.635 --> 10:03.402
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH," BUT, EXCUSE

10:03.402 --> 10:04.637
MY LANGUAGE, IT FUCKS ME UP.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.938
YEAH, OF COURSE THAT

10:05.938 --> 10:06.906
FUCKS YOU UP.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.341
HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT MEANT TO

10:08.341 --> 10:11.944
SIT IN A BATHROOM FOR TEN YEARS

10:11.944 --> 10:13.112
WITH NOTHING TO DO.

10:13.112 --> 10:13.746
YOU'RE THINKING OF RETAINERS.

10:13.746 --> 10:14.347
THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE PLACE

10:14.347 --> 10:15.915
INTO A BATHROOM AND FULLY

10:15.915 --> 10:16.916
NEGLECT FOR AN ENTIRE DECADE.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.317
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.719
SO GIVEN HOW PREVALENT IT IS,

10:19.719 --> 10:21.454
AND HOW DAMAGING IT CAN BE,

10:21.454 --> 10:22.655
TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT SOLITARY

10:22.655 --> 10:24.056
CONFINEMENT.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.291
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

10:25.291 --> 10:26.826
THAT IT HAS ITS ROOTS IN A

10:26.826 --> 10:28.194
SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED PLACE.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.296
IT WAS ACTUALLY INTRODUCED BY

10:30.296 --> 10:32.031
THE QUAKERS AS A NOBLE

10:32.031 --> 10:33.666
EXPERIMENT IN REHABILITATION.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.568
THERE WAS A BELIEF THAT YOU

10:35.568 --> 10:37.570
COULD PUT A PRISONER IN HIS OWN

10:37.570 --> 10:38.804
SOLITARY CELL, FREED FROM THE

10:38.804 --> 10:39.605
EVIL INFLUENCES OF MODERN

10:39.605 --> 10:41.007
SOCIETY.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.576
AND IF YOU PUT THEM IN THAT

10:43.576 --> 10:46.145
CELL, THEY WOULD BECOME LIKE A

10:46.145 --> 10:48.714
PENITENT MONK, FREE TO COME

10:48.714 --> 10:50.149
CLOSE TO GOD AND TO THEIR OWN

10:50.149 --> 10:50.716
INNER BEING, AND THEY WOULD

10:50.716 --> 10:51.617
NATURALLY HEAL.

10:51.617 --> 10:52.718
IT'S TRUE!

10:52.718 --> 10:54.120
THE WHOLE IDEA OF SOLITARY CAME

10:54.120 --> 10:55.521
FROM QUAKERS.

10:55.521 --> 10:57.323
AND ON ONE HAND, IT'S NOT

10:57.323 --> 10:58.624
SURPRISING THAT A FORM OF BRUTAL

10:58.624 --> 11:00.159
TORTURE AND PUNISHMENT WAS

11:00.159 --> 11:01.927
INVENTED BY A RELIGIOUS GROUP.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.429
ON THE OTHER, IF YOU GAVE ME

11:03.429 --> 11:04.430
FIFTY GUESSES FOR WHICH ONE

11:04.430 --> 11:05.598
INVENTED LOCKING PEOPLE IN A

11:05.598 --> 11:06.699
SMALL ROOM ALONE TO FEEL GUILTY

11:06.699 --> 11:08.868
24 HOURS A DAY, I'D GUESS

11:08.868 --> 11:09.969
"CATHOLICS" FIFTY TIMES IN A

11:09.969 --> 11:13.472
ROW.

11:16.742 --> 11:17.343
QUAKERS BASICALLY THOUGHT THAT

11:17.343 --> 11:18.177
PRISONERS ISOLATED IN CELLS WITH

11:18.177 --> 11:18.811
A BIBLE COULD USE THAT TIME TO

11:18.811 --> 11:20.346
REFLECT, REPENT AND EVENTUALLY

11:20.346 --> 11:21.814
REFORM.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.516
THAT'S EVEN WHERE THE TERM

11:23.516 --> 11:24.750
"PENITENTIARY" ORIGINATED.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.252
WHICH IS A HANDY FUN FACT IF YOU

11:26.252 --> 11:28.020
EVER WANT TO QUICKLY RAISE A FEW

11:28.020 --> 11:31.457
RED FLAGS ON A FIRST DATE.

11:32.158 --> 11:32.691
BUT BY THE MID-1800S, THE

11:32.691 --> 11:33.926
PSYCHOLOGICAL HARMS OF ISOLATION

11:33.926 --> 11:34.760
WERE BECOMING CLEAR.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.395
AND BY 1890, THE SUPREME COURT

11:36.395 --> 11:37.797
DECLARED THAT SOLITARY

11:37.797 --> 11:39.832
CONFINEMENT MADE PRISONERS,

11:39.832 --> 11:41.801
QUOTE, "VIOLENTLY INSANE."

11:41.801 --> 11:43.436
AFTER THAT, THE PRACTICE WAS

11:43.436 --> 11:45.771
LARGELY ABANDONED UNTIL THE

11:45.771 --> 11:47.139
1980S, WHEN MASS INCARCERATION

11:47.139 --> 11:48.374
LED TO PRISON OVERCROWDING,

11:48.374 --> 11:49.575
WHICH IN TURN LED TO A RISE IN

11:49.575 --> 11:52.211
PRISON VIOLENCE.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.081
AND IN AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE

11:55.081 --> 11:56.449
ORDER, PRISON OFFICIALS STARTED

11:56.449 --> 11:57.249
RAMPING UP THE USE OF SOLITARY

11:57.249 --> 11:57.683
AGAIN.

11:57.683 --> 11:58.284
AND AT THIS POINT, IT'S WORTH

11:58.284 --> 11:59.318
LOOKING AT WHAT MODERN SOLITARY

11:59.318 --> 12:00.719
ACTUALLY CONSISTS OF.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.289
GENERALLY IT INVOLVES ISOLATING

12:03.289 --> 12:04.657
PEOPLE FOR 22 TO 24 HOURS PER

12:04.657 --> 12:06.192
DAY IN SMALL CELLS, WITH MINIMAL

12:06.192 --> 12:07.460
CONTACT WITH OTHERS, AND WITH

12:07.460 --> 12:08.828
LITTLE OR NO ACCESS TO READING

12:08.828 --> 12:11.931
MATERIALS, OR RADIO AND TV.

12:11.931 --> 12:12.565
AND EVEN IF THAT'S PRETTY MUCH

12:12.565 --> 12:14.233
WHAT YOU ASSUMED, THERE ARE

12:14.233 --> 12:16.802
ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS TO SOLITARY

12:16.802 --> 12:17.803
YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT, LIKE THE

12:17.803 --> 12:19.205
FACT THAT SOME CELLS ARE LIT

12:19.205 --> 12:20.673
AROUND-THE-CLOCK, AND THERE CAN

12:20.673 --> 12:23.042
BE A NEAR-CONSTANT SOUND OF

12:23.042 --> 12:24.710
BANGING, SCREAMING, AND MOANING.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.312
FRONTLINE SPENT FOUR MONTHS

12:26.312 --> 12:27.780
FILMING IN A SOLITARY

12:27.780 --> 12:30.249
CONFINEMENT UNIT, AND RELEASED A

12:30.249 --> 12:31.917
VIDEO JUST OF THE NOISE.

12:31.917 --> 12:32.751
AND HERE'S JUST 20 SECONDS OF

12:32.751 --> 12:33.686
IT.

12:52.671 --> 12:54.306
HOLY SHIT.

12:54.306 --> 12:56.075
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO THINK IN

12:56.075 --> 12:57.743
THERE, LET ALONE SLEEP?

12:57.743 --> 12:59.178
THERE'S A REASON PEOPLE FALL

12:59.178 --> 13:00.779
ASLEEP TO "SOUNDS OF THE

13:00.779 --> 13:02.281
RAINFOREST" AND NOT "SOUNDS OF

13:02.281 --> 13:03.082
ONE OF THOSE HAUNTED HOUSES

13:03.082 --> 13:03.749
WHERE YOU HAVE TO SIGN A WAIVER

13:03.749 --> 13:05.718
TO GET IN."

13:05.718 --> 13:06.952
SO A PERSON CAN BE STUCK ALONE

13:06.952 --> 13:08.954
IN A CELL FOR 23 HOURS A DAY OR

13:08.954 --> 13:10.823
MORE, WITH THE SOUNDTRACK TO

13:10.823 --> 13:13.626
"STOMP" PLAYING IN THE

13:13.626 --> 13:14.193
BACKGROUND, AND AS THIS MAN

13:14.193 --> 13:15.828
WILL TELL YOU, FILLING THAT TIME

13:15.828 --> 13:17.830
CAN TAKE SOME REAL EFFORT.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.165
ONE OF THE THINGS I DID IN

13:19.165 --> 13:21.567
SOLITARY TO PASS THE TIME WAS

13:21.567 --> 13:22.668
SAVE MY BREAD, PUT IT ON THE

13:22.668 --> 13:23.769
FLOOR, AND LET THE MICE COME IN

13:23.769 --> 13:25.437
AND EAT IT AND PLAY.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.205
IT WAS ACTION.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.806
IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

13:27.806 --> 13:28.641
IS IT GROSS?

13:28.641 --> 13:29.408
YEAH.

13:29.408 --> 13:30.442
DISGUSTING A LITTLE BIT?

13:30.442 --> 13:31.610
SURE.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.445
BETTER THAN GOING INSANE?

13:33.445 --> 13:34.914
YEAH.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.849
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

13:36.849 --> 13:37.683
BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE

13:37.683 --> 13:38.651
DISGUSTING.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.185
BUT IT IS BETTER THAN GOING

13:39.185 --> 13:39.919
INSANE.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.353
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I

13:41.353 --> 13:42.454
DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT

13:42.454 --> 13:44.790
TIKTOK IS.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.091
I THOUGHT I DID, BUT I CLEARLY

13:46.091 --> 13:47.159
DON'T.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.428
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN APP FOR

13:49.428 --> 13:50.963
TEENS TO DO THE SAME EIGHT

13:50.963 --> 13:54.466
DANCES THAT ALL INVOLVE THIS

13:54.466 --> 13:56.869
MOVE, SO THE CHINESE

13:56.869 --> 13:57.403
GOVERNMENT CAN SPY ON US.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.037
I DIDN'T KNOW FRANK DISCUSSIONS

13:58.037 --> 13:59.338
OF THE CONDITIONS IN PRISONS

13:59.338 --> 14:03.609
WERE PART OF IT TOO.

14:03.609 --> 14:04.176
BUT THAT GUY WASN'T KIDDING,

14:04.176 --> 14:05.477
SOLITARY CAN IRREPARABLY DAMAGE

14:05.477 --> 14:06.045
PEOPLE'S MINDS.

14:06.045 --> 14:06.712
STUDIES SHOW THAT SOME LASTING

14:06.712 --> 14:08.047
MENTAL DAMAGE IS CAUSED AFTER

14:08.047 --> 14:10.616
JUST A FEW DAYS OF ISOLATION.

14:10.616 --> 14:11.884
AND THE EFFECTS CAN BE EVEN MORE

14:11.884 --> 14:12.651
ACUTE WHEN CHILDREN EXPERIENCE

14:12.651 --> 14:14.620
IT.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.222
OH, YEAH, IN CASE I FORGOT TO

14:16.222 --> 14:18.557
MENTION, WE SUBJECT CHILDREN TO

14:18.557 --> 14:20.059
SOLITARY IN THIS COUNTRY, TOO.

14:20.059 --> 14:21.493
VICKI REED WAS SHOCKED BY

14:21.493 --> 14:22.561
WHAT WE FOUND AT THE MIDDLE

14:22.561 --> 14:24.496
TENNESSEE JUVENILE DETENTION

14:24.496 --> 14:25.631
FACILITY IN MURRAY COUNTY.

14:25.631 --> 14:27.099
WE REVEALED JUVENILES OFTEN

14:27.099 --> 14:29.635
SPEND 23 TO 24 HOURS A DAY

14:29.635 --> 14:31.303
LOCKED INSIDE THEIR CELLS.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.972
IF A PARENT LOCKS HER KID IN

14:32.972 --> 14:34.907
A CLOSET AND LEAVES HIM THERE

14:34.907 --> 14:36.709
AND FEEDS HIM THREE TIMES A DAY

14:36.709 --> 14:38.711
AND THAT'S IT, WE WOULD CALL

14:38.711 --> 14:42.481
THAT CHILD ABUSE.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.115
YEAH, SHE'S NOT WRONG.

14:43.115 --> 14:43.716
IF I LEARNED THAT SOMEONE WAS

14:43.716 --> 14:44.550
LOCKING CHILDREN IN A CLOSET ALL

14:44.550 --> 14:45.918
DAY LONG, I'D IMMEDIATELY SAY

14:45.918 --> 14:47.119
TWO THINGS.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.021
ARE THOSE THE CHILDREN FROM THE

14:49.021 --> 14:49.922
"KARS-4-KIDS" COMMERCIAL?

14:49.922 --> 14:50.456
IF SO, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

14:50.456 --> 14:51.890
SERVICE.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.792
BUT IF NOT, THEN THAT'S CHILD

14:53.792 --> 14:54.960
ABUSE AND YOU NEED TO STOP DOING

14:54.960 --> 14:56.762
IT IMMEDIATELY!

14:56.762 --> 14:59.098
SO, IF IT'S THIS TORTUROUS AND

14:59.098 --> 15:00.599
PERMANENTLY DAMAGING, WHY DO WE

15:00.599 --> 15:02.268
PUT PEOPLE IN SOLITARY?

15:02.268 --> 15:04.637
WELL, IF YOU ASK PRISON OR

15:04.637 --> 15:05.638
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THE

15:05.638 --> 15:06.605
RESPONSE YOU'LL OFTEN GET IS,

15:06.605 --> 15:07.606
"WE ACTUALLY DON'T."

15:07.606 --> 15:10.209
THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF

15:10.209 --> 15:11.310
EUPHEMISMS FOR SOLITARY, LIKE

15:11.310 --> 15:13.445
"SEGREGATION," OR "PROTECTIVE

15:13.445 --> 15:14.546
CUSTODY," OR REFERRING TO THE

15:14.546 --> 15:17.916
CELLS AS "RESTRICTED HOUSING

15:17.916 --> 15:18.484
UNITS" OR "SECURITY HOUSING

15:18.484 --> 15:18.917
UNITS."

15:18.917 --> 15:19.918
IN TENNESSEE, WHERE THAT WOMAN

15:19.918 --> 15:21.720
WAS OUTRAGED KIDS WERE BEING

15:21.720 --> 15:23.155
HELD IN ISOLATION, OFFICIALS

15:23.155 --> 15:24.323
THERE SIMPLY CALLED IT "ROOM

15:24.323 --> 15:30.429
RESTRICTION."

15:30.429 --> 15:31.297
AND HERE'S NEW YORK MAYOR

15:31.297 --> 15:32.665
ERIC ADAMS, TRYING TO MAKE A

15:32.665 --> 15:33.532
SIMILAR TYPE OF SEMANTIC

15:33.532 --> 15:33.832
DISTINCTION.

15:33.832 --> 15:34.400
I AM OPPOSED TO SOLITARY

15:34.400 --> 15:34.700
CONFINEMENT.

15:34.700 --> 15:35.968
THAT IS A DRACONIAN WAY TO

15:35.968 --> 15:37.436
PROTECT THE CITY.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.938
BUT WHAT I AM SAYING, YOU CAN'T

15:39.938 --> 15:43.275
BE A-- AN INMATE, SEXUALLY

15:43.275 --> 15:44.410
ASSAULT A CORRECTION OFFICER OR

15:44.410 --> 15:46.512
ANOTHER INMATE, AND THEN STAY IN

15:46.512 --> 15:47.780
GENERAL POPULATION.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.048
PUNITIVE SEGREGATION IS A HUMANE

15:49.048 --> 15:51.216
WAY OF REMOVING DANGEROUS

15:51.216 --> 15:53.752
INMATES TO A LOCATION WHERE THEY

15:53.752 --> 15:56.021
CAN GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED

15:56.021 --> 15:58.357
SO THEY CAN STOP PREYING ON

15:58.357 --> 15:59.124
OTHER INMATES, STAFF, AND

15:59.124 --> 16:00.559
PREYING ON SOCIETY.

16:00.559 --> 16:01.160
YEAH, ADAMS DOESN'T

16:01.160 --> 16:03.929
SUPPORT "SOLITARY CONFINEMENT"

16:03.929 --> 16:05.497
BUT HE'S ALL IN FOR "PUNITIVE

16:05.497 --> 16:06.799
SEGREGATION"-- AN INTERESTING

16:06.799 --> 16:08.834
DISTINCTION CONSIDERING THAT THE

16:08.834 --> 16:10.502
NEW YORK BOARD OF CORRECTIONS'

16:10.502 --> 16:12.137
OWN WEBSITE SAYS THAT PUNITIVE

16:12.137 --> 16:14.073
SEGREGATION IS "ALSO KNOWN AS

16:14.073 --> 16:15.974
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT."

16:15.974 --> 16:18.077
SO THAT'S A PRETTY WEIRD STANCE.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.111
THOUGH IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE

16:19.111 --> 16:20.546
SURPRISING THAT ERIC ADAMS DID

16:20.546 --> 16:21.780
OR SAID SOMETHING WEIRD.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.282
THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO ONCE

16:23.282 --> 16:25.250
TOLD A REPORTER THAT NEW YORK

16:25.250 --> 16:26.685
SITS ON A STORE OF RARE GEMS AND

16:26.685 --> 16:28.721
STONES, WHICH IS WHY "THERE'S A

16:28.721 --> 16:31.790
SPECIAL ENERGY THAT COMES FROM

16:31.790 --> 16:32.725
HERE," INSISTED ON TAKING HIS

16:32.725 --> 16:34.727
FIRST PAYCHECK AS MAYOR IN

16:34.727 --> 16:36.729
CRYPTO, DELIBERATELY POSED FOR

16:36.729 --> 16:38.263
THIS PHOTO, AND HAS REPEATEDLY

16:38.263 --> 16:39.465
HELD UP A SPONGE ON STAGE TO

16:39.465 --> 16:44.436
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RING OUT

16:44.436 --> 16:44.937
THEIR INTERNAL DESPAIR.

16:44.937 --> 16:45.571
ANSWERING THE QUESTION, "WHAT IF

16:45.571 --> 16:46.672
MR. CLEAN WAS A MOTIVATIONAL

16:46.672 --> 16:48.207
SPEAKER?"

16:48.207 --> 16:50.109
BUT THE FACT IS, WHATEVER YOU

16:50.109 --> 16:51.910
CALL SOLITARY, THE EXPERIENCE

16:51.910 --> 16:53.579
FOR THE PERSON GOING THROUGH IT

16:53.579 --> 16:55.080
IS THE SAME.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.181
AND CORRECTIONS OFFICERS WILL

16:56.181 --> 16:59.017
OFTEN JUSTIFY IT BY ARGUING, AS

16:59.017 --> 17:00.352
ADAMS JUST DID, THAT IT'S A

17:00.352 --> 17:02.087
NECESSARY TOOL TO ISOLATE

17:02.087 --> 17:04.123
WRONGDOERS AND PRESERVE ORDER.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.557
HERE'S THE HEAD OF THE NEW YORK

17:05.557 --> 17:07.059
CITY CORRECTIONS OFFICERS'

17:07.059 --> 17:09.061
UNION, MAKING THAT EXACT POINT.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.095
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

17:10.095 --> 17:13.665
SEGREGATE THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE,

17:13.665 --> 17:16.301
YOU KNOW, IF WE HAVE A SOCIETY

17:16.301 --> 17:17.870
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES, THEN WE'LL

17:17.870 --> 17:19.838
JUST HAVE TOTAL ANARCHY.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.073
ISN'T THE PROBLEM THAT MANY

17:21.073 --> 17:23.842
OF THOSE IN SOLITARY ARE NOT THE

17:23.842 --> 17:24.743
REALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS?

17:24.743 --> 17:26.512
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO'VE BROKEN

17:26.512 --> 17:29.281
MINOR RULES OR ARE SUICIDAL?

17:29.281 --> 17:31.450
THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.786
MINOR INFRACTIONS, PEOPLE DO NOT

17:33.786 --> 17:34.553
END UP IN SOLI-- IN PUNITIVE

17:34.553 --> 17:37.122
SEGREGATION.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.857
FIRST, GOOD CATCH!

17:38.857 --> 17:41.393
YOU ALMOST CALLED IT "SOLITARY

17:41.393 --> 17:43.829
CONFINEMENT" THERE, A NEAR-MISS

17:43.829 --> 17:44.897
ON PAR WITH HAVING A MUSTACHE

17:44.897 --> 17:46.999
THAT ALMOST MAKES YOU A

17:46.999 --> 17:49.435
JOHN WATERS IMPERSONATOR.

17:49.435 --> 17:52.171
BUT SECOND, THE CLAIM THAT

17:52.171 --> 17:53.872
"PEOPLE DON'T END UP IN SOLITARY

17:53.872 --> 17:54.840
FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS" IS JUST

17:54.840 --> 17:58.076
NOT TRUE.

17:58.076 --> 17:58.644
IN GENERAL, RESEARCHERS HAVE

17:58.644 --> 18:02.281
FOUND VIOLENCE IS TYPICALLY NOT

18:02.281 --> 18:03.148
THE MOST COMMON REASON PEOPLE

18:03.148 --> 18:03.615
ARE SENT TO SOLITARY.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.217
IN OREGON, RESEARCHERS ONCE

18:05.217 --> 18:06.452
FOUND THAT DISOBEDIENCE WAS THE

18:06.452 --> 18:07.786
INFRACTION RESULTING IN THE MOST

18:07.786 --> 18:08.987
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT SANCTIONS.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.322
AND NATIONWIDE, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

18:10.322 --> 18:12.124
SENT TO SOLITARY FOR REASONS

18:12.124 --> 18:15.260
INCLUDING-- AND THESE ARE REAL

18:15.260 --> 18:15.861
NOT MAKING THEIR BED, USING

18:15.861 --> 18:16.862
FACEBOOK, AND HAVING TOO MANY

18:16.862 --> 18:18.197
ENVELOPES.

18:18.197 --> 18:22.568
AND AS THIS FORMERLY

18:22.568 --> 18:23.368
INCARCERATED MAN WILL TELL YOU,

18:23.368 --> 18:23.936
THE LIST DOESN'T STOP THERE.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.470
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GO TO

18:24.470 --> 18:26.338
SOLITARY FOR THINGS AS LITTLE AS

18:26.338 --> 18:27.673
HANDING OTHER PEOPLE STUFF,

18:27.673 --> 18:29.675
HAVING TOO MANY CIGARETTES IN

18:29.675 --> 18:30.876
THEIR POCKET.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.744
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GO TO SOLITARY

18:32.744 --> 18:34.446
FOR TALKING BACK.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.547
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GO TO SOLITARY

18:35.547 --> 18:37.216
FOR NOT HAVING THEIR SHIRT

18:37.216 --> 18:38.283
TUCKED IN.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.251
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GO TO SOLITARY

18:39.251 --> 18:41.687
FOR NOT HAVING THE RIGHT SHOES

18:41.687 --> 18:42.154
IN THE GYM.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.089
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GO TO THE BOX

18:44.089 --> 18:45.724
FOR A LOT OF STUFF, BRO.

18:45.724 --> 18:46.992
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

18:46.992 --> 18:48.393
SOLITARY SHOULDN'T BE WHERE WE

18:48.393 --> 18:50.095
SEND PEOPLE WHO ARE DRESSING

18:50.095 --> 18:51.096
INCORRECTLY.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.498
IF IT WERE, I CAN THINK OF FOUR

18:52.498 --> 18:54.533
PEOPLE WHO'D BE IN THERE RIGHT

18:54.533 --> 18:56.602
NOW, YET INSTEAD, THEY'RE

18:56.602 --> 18:57.402
WALKING AROUND FREE, STRUGGLING

18:57.402 --> 19:01.740
TO ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS.

19:02.908 --> 19:03.442
SO THE TRUTH IS PETTY RULE

19:03.442 --> 19:04.109
INFRACTIONS ARE A VERY COMMON

19:04.109 --> 19:05.010
CAUSE OF LANDING PEOPLE IN

19:05.010 --> 19:09.281
SOLITARY.

19:09.281 --> 19:09.715
AND THAT IS NOT ALL.

19:09.715 --> 19:10.349
PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEN AS "AT RISK"

19:10.349 --> 19:10.983
IN THE GENERAL PRISON POPULATION

19:10.983 --> 19:12.684
BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUNG,

19:12.684 --> 19:13.952
MENTALLY ILL, INTELLECTUALLY

19:13.952 --> 19:15.220
DISABLED, GAY OR TRANSGENDER--

19:15.220 --> 19:16.488
CAN WIND UP IN THERE "FOR THEIR

19:16.488 --> 19:18.757
OWN PROTECTION."

19:18.757 --> 19:22.394
AND THINK ABOUT HOW ABSURD THAT

19:22.394 --> 19:22.794
LOGIC IS.

19:22.794 --> 19:23.896
"THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

19:23.896 --> 19:24.463
KEEP YOU SAFE IS TO INFLICT

19:24.463 --> 19:25.864
ENORMOUS HARM ON YOU."

19:25.864 --> 19:26.999
IT'S LIKE ARGUING, "THE ONLY WAY

19:26.999 --> 19:28.400
TO KEEP YOU HYDRATED IS TO

19:28.400 --> 19:30.502
WATERBOARD YOU."

19:30.502 --> 19:30.836
ONE, IT ISN'T.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.570
SO TWO, FIND ANOTHER FUCKING

19:31.570 --> 19:33.171
WAY.

19:33.171 --> 19:34.239
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

19:34.239 --> 19:35.440
WHAT IF SOMEONE ACTUALLY IS A

19:35.440 --> 19:37.376
POTENTIAL THREAT TO INMATES OR

19:37.376 --> 19:39.278
GUARDS?

19:39.278 --> 19:40.779
SHOULDN'T THEY BE GETTING LOCKED

19:40.779 --> 19:41.146
UP IN SOLITARY?"

19:41.146 --> 19:43.282
WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT A

19:43.282 --> 19:45.217
2016 REPORT FOUND THAT "THERE IS

19:45.217 --> 19:45.651
LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT

19:45.651 --> 19:47.019
ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION HAS

19:47.019 --> 19:48.120
HAD ANY EFFECTS ON OVERALL

19:48.120 --> 19:49.621
LEVELS OF VIOLENCE" IN

19:49.621 --> 19:51.623
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES.

19:51.623 --> 19:52.558
IN FACT SOME RESEARCH HAS FOUND

19:52.558 --> 19:53.559
SUBJECTING PEOPLE TO SOLITARY

19:53.559 --> 19:55.561
CAN LEAD THEM TO BECOME MORE,

19:55.561 --> 19:57.396
NOT LESS, VIOLENT.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.931
AND THAT CAN OBVIOUSLY BE A

19:58.931 --> 19:59.464
PROBLEM, NOT JUST INSIDE

19:59.464 --> 20:00.999
PRISONS, BUT ALSO, AFTER PEOPLE

20:00.999 --> 20:03.135
ARE RELEASED.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.870
EVEN THOSE WHO'VE WORKED WITHIN

20:04.870 --> 20:06.171
PRISONS-- LIKE THIS FORMER

20:06.171 --> 20:09.074
WARDEN-- WILL TELL YOU HOW

20:09.074 --> 20:09.675
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE OUR CURRENT

20:09.675 --> 20:10.809
SYSTEM IS.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.578
IF I HAVE SOMEBODY THAT COMES

20:12.578 --> 20:14.646
IN WITH A FIVE-YEAR COMMITMENT,

20:14.646 --> 20:17.082
YOU CAN HAVE THEM DO THEIR WHOLE

20:17.082 --> 20:18.216
TIME IN SEGREGATION, BUT I DON'T

20:18.216 --> 20:19.618
WANT HIM LIVING NEXT TO ME WHEN

20:19.618 --> 20:21.587
WE RELEASE HIM.

20:21.587 --> 20:22.487
THE REALITY IS, 80% OF THESE

20:22.487 --> 20:23.722
INMATES ARE GOING TO BE HITTING

20:23.722 --> 20:24.723
THE STREET, OKAY?

20:24.723 --> 20:26.058
SO, WE CAN EITHER MAKE THEM

20:26.058 --> 20:27.993
WORSE, OKAY, AND CREATE MORE

20:27.993 --> 20:28.860
VICTIMS WHEN THEY GO ON THE

20:28.860 --> 20:29.628
STREET, OR WE CAN REHABILITATE

20:29.628 --> 20:31.330
THEM.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.698
YEAH, AND WHEN YOU

20:32.698 --> 20:34.600
FRAME IT AS A CHOICE LIKE THAT,

20:34.600 --> 20:35.367
IT'S HARD TO PICK SOLITARY

20:35.367 --> 20:36.935
CONFINEMENT.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.136
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "FOR DINNER

20:38.136 --> 20:39.638
TONIGHT, WE CAN EITHER GET

20:39.638 --> 20:41.173
PIZZA, OR WE COULD ASSASSINATE

20:41.173 --> 20:42.541
PAUL MCCARTNEY."

20:42.541 --> 20:43.742
ONE OF THOSE CHOICES MAKES

20:43.742 --> 20:45.210
SENSE, AND THE OTHER IS

20:45.210 --> 20:49.147
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE FOR

20:49.147 --> 20:49.548
EVERYONE ON EARTH.

20:49.548 --> 20:50.248
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, THIS ISN'T

20:50.248 --> 20:51.283
TO SAY THAT PEOPLE WHO'VE

20:51.283 --> 20:53.752
COMMITTED VIOLENT ACTS IN PRISON

20:53.752 --> 20:56.188
SHOULD JUST BE LEFT IN THE

20:56.188 --> 20:56.655
GENERAL POPULATION TO

20:56.655 --> 20:57.222
POTENTIALLY HARM OTHERS.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.291
THEY CAN BE SEPARATED, WITHOUT

20:59.291 --> 21:00.892
BEING COMPLETELY ISOLATED.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.494
TAKE NORTH DAKOTA.

21:02.494 --> 21:03.595
THEIR STATE PRISON OFFICIALS

21:03.595 --> 21:05.430
MADE THE BOLD DECISION TO END

21:05.430 --> 21:07.132
THE USE OF SOLITARY, BUT IN

21:07.132 --> 21:08.333
DOING SO, TO ALSO CREATE A LESS

21:08.333 --> 21:10.369
HOSTILE ATMOSPHERE OVERALL.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.571
SO WHEN PRISONERS GOT IN TROUBLE

21:12.571 --> 21:14.206
FOR SERIOUS INFRACTIONS LIKE

21:14.206 --> 21:15.641
VIOLENCE, INSTEAD OF SOLITARY,

21:15.641 --> 21:17.042
THEY WERE SENT TO A BRAND-NEW

21:17.042 --> 21:19.077
UNIT WHERE THEY'D GET

21:19.077 --> 21:20.512
SIGNIFICANT OUT-OF-CELL TIME,

21:20.512 --> 21:22.114
AND ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL

21:22.114 --> 21:22.481
TREATMENT.

21:22.481 --> 21:24.650
AND IT'S HAD PROMISING RESULTS.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.084
JERRY HOLMES WAS JUST

21:26.084 --> 21:28.420
RELEASED FROM THE NEW BEHAVIORAL

21:28.420 --> 21:30.756
HEALTH INTERVENTION UNIT, OR

21:30.756 --> 21:32.024
BIU, IN SEPTEMBER.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.559
MINDSET, 100% BETTER.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.094
'CAUSE YOU'RE JUST NOT CRAMMED

21:36.094 --> 21:37.696
UP IN A HOLE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

21:37.696 --> 21:39.164
COMING OUT OF A BOX.

21:39.164 --> 21:40.198
BRANDON DAVIS HAS SPENT TIME

21:40.198 --> 21:43.001
IN THE OLD ADMINISTRATIVE

21:43.001 --> 21:44.202
SEGREGATION UNIT, OR ASU, AND

21:44.202 --> 21:45.837
THE NEW BIU.

21:45.837 --> 21:47.172
HE SAYS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE

21:47.172 --> 21:47.806
IS JUST HAVING SOMEONE TO TALK

21:47.806 --> 21:49.307
TO.

21:49.307 --> 21:50.442
NOW, THEY HAVE INTERACTION AND

21:50.442 --> 21:51.810
COUNSELING TO WORK TOWARD A

21:51.810 --> 21:53.245
SOLUTION.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.247
BECAUSE IF YOU BOTTLE IN YOUR

21:55.247 --> 21:56.948
ISSUES, IT JUST-- IT-- IT

21:56.948 --> 21:58.917
OVERWHELMS THE PERSON.

21:58.917 --> 21:59.885
LIKE, 'CAUSE I HAVE MY OWN

21:59.885 --> 22:01.987
PROBLEMS, AND LIKE, WHEN-- WHEN

22:01.987 --> 22:03.455
YOU'RE ISOLATED AND YOU HAVE

22:03.455 --> 22:06.658
THESE ISSUES, AND IT'S LIKE, YOU

22:06.658 --> 22:08.160
HAVE NOWHERE TO RELEASE THEM, OR

22:08.160 --> 22:10.162
NO ONE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.797
YEAH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

22:11.797 --> 22:13.398
HAVE BEEN IN SOLITARY TO

22:13.398 --> 22:14.032
UNDERSTAND THAT TALKING THROUGH

22:14.032 --> 22:19.738
YOUR ISSUES WITH OTHER PEOPLE IS

22:19.738 --> 22:20.305
PROBABLY BETTER FOR YOU THAN

22:20.305 --> 22:20.872
BEING LOCKED IN A CONCRETE

22:20.872 --> 22:21.373
TOILET CAVE.

22:21.373 --> 22:23.308
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING ANY OF

22:23.308 --> 22:24.209
THIS IS EASY.

22:24.209 --> 22:25.177
BECAUSE I KNOW THE SOLUTION

22:25.177 --> 22:26.645
SHOULD BE SIMPLE.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.180
"PUTTING PEOPLE IN SOLITARY IS

22:28.180 --> 22:29.381
TORTURE, SO LET'S STOP DOING

22:29.381 --> 22:30.682
IT."

22:30.682 --> 22:32.451
BUT EXACTLY HOW WE DO THAT IS

22:32.451 --> 22:33.051
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO ANY

22:33.051 --> 22:36.088
REFORM ACTUALLY WORKING.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.656
UNFORTUNATELY, IN MULTIPLE

22:37.656 --> 22:38.623
STATES, WHEN THEY'VE TAKEN STEPS

22:38.623 --> 22:40.692
TO LIMIT THE USE OF SOLITARY,

22:40.692 --> 22:50.702
CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS HAVE FOUND

22:50.702 --> 22:51.737
WAYS TO KEEP DOING IT ANYWAY.

22:51.737 --> 22:52.304
BY DOING THINGS LIKE KEEPING

22:52.304 --> 22:52.904
PRISONERS ISOLATED FOR PERIODS

22:52.904 --> 22:53.405
JUST BENEATH THE STATE'S

22:53.405 --> 22:54.606
DEFINITION OF "SOLITARY," OR

22:54.606 --> 22:55.240
USING ONE OF THE MANY EUPHEMISMS

22:55.240 --> 22:55.674
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN.

22:55.674 --> 22:56.274
ONE KEY REASON NORTH DAKOTA'S

22:56.274 --> 22:56.875
REFORMS WORKED IS BECAUSE THEY

22:56.875 --> 22:57.709
CAME DIRECTLY FROM PEOPLE

22:57.709 --> 22:58.610
RUNNING THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM

22:58.610 --> 22:59.911
THERE.

22:59.911 --> 23:01.513
THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT REDUCING

23:01.513 --> 23:03.515
THE USE OF SOLITARY ENTAILED

23:03.515 --> 23:05.884
CHANGING THE WHOLE CULTURE OF

23:05.884 --> 23:06.651
THEIR PRISONS, AND THEY DID

23:06.651 --> 23:09.020
HAVE TO GET RID OF STAFF WHO

23:09.020 --> 23:12.057
WEREN'T ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA,

23:12.057 --> 23:13.158
SO THAT IT COULD BE EXECUTED

23:13.158 --> 23:13.992
PROPERLY.

23:13.992 --> 23:14.559
AND WHILE IT WASN'T EASY--

23:14.559 --> 23:15.360
THERE WAS AN INITIAL RISE IN

23:15.360 --> 23:16.795
VIOLENCE IN THE PRISON'S GENERAL

23:16.795 --> 23:18.530
POPULATION IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD

23:18.530 --> 23:20.465
THEY STUCK WITH IT, AND NOT

23:20.465 --> 23:22.501
ONLY HAS THE OVERALL TREND IN

23:22.501 --> 23:23.869
VIOLENCE BEEN DOWNWARD, BUT BOTH

23:23.869 --> 23:25.370
INCARCERATED PERSONS AND STAFF

23:25.370 --> 23:27.405
MEMBERS REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN

23:27.405 --> 23:28.874
THEIR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING,

23:28.874 --> 23:30.675
BETTER INTERACTIONS WITH ONE

23:30.675 --> 23:31.910
ANOTHER, AND LESS EXPOSURE TO

23:31.910 --> 23:33.378
VIOLENCE FOLLOWING THE REFORMS.

23:33.378 --> 23:34.446
SO IT CAN BE DONE, IF WE WANT

23:34.446 --> 23:36.414
TO.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.849
AND I KNOW THAT SOME CORRECTIONS

23:37.849 --> 23:39.618
OFFICIALS WILL STILL INSIST THAT

23:39.618 --> 23:41.253
THEY NEED IT.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.188
BUT I'D ARGUE THAT, IF YOU FIND

23:43.188 --> 23:44.623
YOURSELF MAKING THE CASE THAT

23:44.623 --> 23:46.391
YOU NEED TO TORTURE PEOPLE TO

23:46.391 --> 23:47.993
KEEP YOUR FACILITY SAFE, THAT IN

23:47.993 --> 23:50.262
ITSELF IS AN ADMISSION OF

23:50.262 --> 23:52.230
CATASTROPHIC FAILURE, AND YOU

23:52.230 --> 23:54.699
MAY NEED TO GO.

23:54.699 --> 23:55.233
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

23:55.233 --> 23:57.369
REMEMBER JUST HOW LASTING THE

23:57.369 --> 23:58.470
DAMAGE HERE CAN BE.

23:58.470 --> 23:59.604
THE VOICES IN THIS DEBATE ARE

23:59.604 --> 24:00.906
OFTEN DOMINATED BY CORRECTIONS

24:00.906 --> 24:02.707
OFFICIALS, BUT IT IS WORTH

24:02.707 --> 24:03.909
LISTENING, AT LENGTH, TO THE

24:03.909 --> 24:05.110
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN HARMED BY

24:05.110 --> 24:06.144
THIS.

24:06.144 --> 24:09.681
ANTHONY GRAVES WAS KEPT IN

24:09.681 --> 24:10.482
SOLITARY FOR 18 YEARS, AFTER

24:10.482 --> 24:11.750
BEING WRONGLY CONVICTED.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.485
AND JUST LISTEN TO HIM TESTIFY

24:13.485 --> 24:14.486
BEFORE CONGRESS, ABOUT WHAT IT

24:14.486 --> 24:16.054
DID TO HIM.

24:16.054 --> 24:19.891
I HAVE BEEN FREE FOR ALMOST

24:19.891 --> 24:23.461
TWO YEARS AND I STILL CRY AT

24:23.461 --> 24:25.630
NIGHT BECAUSE NO ONE OUT HERE

24:25.630 --> 24:26.898
CAN RELATE TO WHAT I'VE GONE

24:26.898 --> 24:29.234
THROUGH.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.368
I BATTLE WITH THESE FEELINGS OF

24:30.368 --> 24:32.204
LONELINESS.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.939
I'VE TRIED THERAPY, BUT IT

24:33.939 --> 24:35.774
DIDN'T WORK.

24:35.774 --> 24:37.242
THE THERAPIST WAS CRYING MORE

24:37.242 --> 24:38.410
THAN ME.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.979
SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW

24:40.979 --> 24:42.681
INHUMANE OUR SYSTEM WOULD TREAT

24:42.681 --> 24:46.251
ME.

24:46.251 --> 24:47.652
I HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S

24:47.652 --> 24:49.554
SLEEP SINCE I'VE BEEN OUT.

24:49.554 --> 24:51.389
I ONLY SLEEP ABOUT 2 1/2 TO

24:51.389 --> 24:53.391
THREE HOURS A NIGHT AND THEN I'M

24:53.391 --> 24:54.326
UP.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.627
MY BODY HAS NOT MADE THE

24:55.627 --> 24:58.396
ADJUSTMENT.

24:58.396 --> 25:00.031
I HAVE MOOD SWINGS THAT JUST

25:00.031 --> 25:01.933
CAUSES EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWNS.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.668
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME

25:03.668 --> 25:04.236
FROM, THEY JUST COME OUT OF

25:04.236 --> 25:06.738
NOWHERE.

25:06.738 --> 25:09.374
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT MAKES OUR

25:09.374 --> 25:11.109
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

25:11.109 --> 25:12.611
CRIMINAL.

25:12.611 --> 25:13.912
HE'S RIGHT.

25:13.912 --> 25:16.214
SOLITARY ISN'T SOMETHING WE DO

25:16.214 --> 25:17.849
TO PEOPLE BEHIND BARS, IT'S

25:17.849 --> 25:19.317
SOMETHING WE DO TO THEM FOREVER.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.419
IT NEEDS TO BE UNIVERSALLY

25:21.419 --> 25:23.722
UNDERSTOOD HOW INDEFENSIBLE IT

25:23.722 --> 25:31.363
IS.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.230
SO MAYBE, JUST MAYBE IN THE

25:32.230 --> 25:32.764
FUTURE, WE CAN ONE DAY GET

25:32.764 --> 25:33.365
TO A POINT WHERE, EVEN IF YOU

25:33.365 --> 25:33.932
APPROACHED THE WORST-DRESSED

25:33.932 --> 25:34.466
BROS ON THE STREET OF ANY

25:34.466 --> 25:35.800
AMERICAN CITY AND ASKED THEM,

25:35.800 --> 25:36.434
"WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE NUMBER

25:36.434 --> 25:37.035
OF PEOPLE TO HAVE IN SOLITARY

25:37.035 --> 25:38.503
CONFINEMENT?," THE ANSWER THEY'D

25:38.503 --> 25:39.271
COME UP WITH, WITH NO

25:39.271 --> 25:41.740
HESITATION, IS ZERO.

25:41.740 --> 25:47.879
AND NOW THIS.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.080
AND NOW, NOBODY

25:49.080 --> 25:51.416
REPORTS ON THE NEWS LIKE FOX 26

25:51.416 --> 25:53.285
IS ISAIAH CAREY APPEARED >>

25:53.285 --> 25:55.820
WELCOME BACK TO THE SECOND HALF

25:55.820 --> 26:01.126
HOUR, REALLY MAY BE A AS TOO MU.

26:01.126 --> 26:02.761
INFLATION CONTINUES TO HIT

26:02.761 --> 26:04.996
THE EVERY CORNER OF THE BUSINESS

26:04.996 --> 26:05.964
SECTORS INCLUDING THE STRIP

26:05.964 --> 26:06.932
CLUB.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.134
ONE MAN IN NEW YORK DROPPED HIS

26:09.134 --> 26:09.768
DRAWERS AND PULLED OUT A PIPE TO

26:09.768 --> 26:14.406
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HE IS COMING,

26:14.406 --> 26:16.608
COMING OR AT LEAST RUNNING FOR

26:16.608 --> 26:17.342
OFFICE.

26:17.342 --> 26:20.712
A STORY HAS GONE VIRAL

26:20.712 --> 26:22.681
THROUGHOUT ALL OF TIKTOK ABOUT

26:22.681 --> 26:24.582
HOW SHE STUCK A SO FAR UP HER

26:24.582 --> 26:25.216
BACKSIDE THAT SHE COULD NOT GET

26:25.216 --> 26:28.453
IT OUT.

26:28.453 --> 26:29.621
NOW THURSDAY THIEVES WHO WILL

26:29.621 --> 26:31.323
STILL WET ON THE WATER TO GET

26:31.323 --> 26:34.993
WHAT THEY ARE BROKE ASSES' ONE.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.795
A FILTH NICKEL AND DIMING THIEF

26:36.795 --> 26:41.399
THAT NEEDS HIS ASS KICKED.

26:41.399 --> 26:42.567
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF SPLENDID

26:42.567 --> 26:43.768
DADDY'S.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.437
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE, MARRIAGE

26:45.437 --> 26:47.639
DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY GRANT YOU

26:47.639 --> 26:47.806
SEX.

26:47.806 --> 26:50.408
LEARN THAT.

26:51.009 --> 26:51.509
MOVING ON.

26:51.509 --> 26:52.344
FINALLY TONIGHT, I WANT TO TALK

26:52.344 --> 26:54.913
ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.614
IT THE REASON WHY YOUR

26:56.614 --> 26:57.549
UNLICENSED HALLOWEEN COSTUME OF

26:57.549 --> 26:58.984
OSCAR THE GROUCH IS CALLED

26:58.984 --> 26:59.784
SOMETHING LIKE "CRANKY TRASH

26:59.784 --> 27:02.354
PERVERT."

27:02.354 --> 27:02.988
AND BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER, I

27:02.988 --> 27:04.622
WANT TO SHOW YOU THE TRAILER FOR

27:04.622 --> 27:05.390
A RECENT HORROR MOVIE.

27:05.390 --> 27:11.529
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, I'LL

27:11.529 --> 27:12.130
JUST SAY IT HAS A SOMEWHAT

27:12.130 --> 27:15.000
UNEXPECTED VILLAIN.

27:15.000 --> 27:15.567
CHRISTOPHER, WE NEED TO

27:15.567 --> 27:18.937
LEAVE, NOW.

27:18.937 --> 27:19.504
I REALLY NEED TO FIND OUT

27:19.504 --> 27:20.071
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE, OKAY?

27:39.391 --> 27:39.824
YES.

27:39.824 --> 27:40.692
EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT IS

27:40.692 --> 27:41.760
DISTURBING, INCLUDING THAT

27:41.760 --> 27:43.561
WINNIE THE POOH IN THIS MOVIE

27:43.561 --> 27:44.362
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE SHAVED AND

27:44.362 --> 27:46.531
BLEACHED THE GRINCH.

27:46.531 --> 27:47.365
ALSO, WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE THE

27:47.365 --> 27:48.600
BAD GUY?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.001
ANY OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS

27:50.001 --> 27:50.902
WOULD MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE AS A

27:50.902 --> 27:52.303
KILLER.

27:52.303 --> 27:52.537
PIGLET?

27:52.537 --> 27:53.171
INFERIORITY COMPLEX.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.239
TICKING TIME BOMB.

27:54.239 --> 27:54.973
TIGGER?

27:54.973 --> 27:55.740
FAST.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.441
POWERFUL.

27:56.441 --> 27:57.375
UNHINGED.

27:57.375 --> 27:57.709
RABBIT?

27:57.709 --> 27:58.743
TWISTED CONTROL FREAK.

27:58.743 --> 27:59.611
EEYORE?

27:59.611 --> 28:00.578
DON'T GET ME STARTED.

28:00.578 --> 28:01.379
HE'S BEEN KICKED AROUND FOR

28:01.379 --> 28:02.514
DECADES.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.715
WHEN EEYORE SNAPS, NONE OF US

28:03.715 --> 28:06.251
ARE SAFE.

28:06.251 --> 28:07.152
NOW, UNSURPRISINGLY, NOT

28:07.152 --> 28:09.054
EVERYONE WAS ON BOARD WITH THE

28:09.054 --> 28:10.755
MOVIE'S CONCEPT.

28:10.755 --> 28:11.656
THAT IS AWFUL, THEY CAN'T

28:11.656 --> 28:12.791
TURN WINNIE THE POOH INTO A

28:12.791 --> 28:14.259
HORROR FILM.

28:14.259 --> 28:15.960
THAT'D BE TERRIFYING, WOULDN'T

28:15.960 --> 28:16.561
IT?

28:16.561 --> 28:18.263
I'M USED TO HIM BEING, LIKE,

28:18.263 --> 28:20.031
A CUTE LITTLE BEAR IN THE WOODS,

28:20.031 --> 28:22.000
NOT A-- NOT A CRIMINAL.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.269
RIGHT, WINNIE THE POOH

28:24.269 --> 28:25.437
IS CUDDLY AND FUN.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.672
HE'S AN IMPORTANT ROLE MODEL FOR

28:27.672 --> 28:33.411
WOODLAND BEARS, ESPECIALLY NOW,

28:33.411 --> 28:34.512
WHEN THEY HAVE SO MANY REALLY

28:34.512 --> 28:34.779
BAD ONES.

28:34.779 --> 28:35.380
NOW, THE REASON THAT MOVIE

28:35.380 --> 28:36.881
HASN'T BEEN CRUSHED UNDER THE

28:36.881 --> 28:37.515
FORCE OF A THOUSAND LAWSUITS, IS

28:37.515 --> 28:38.583
BECAUSE IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR,

28:38.583 --> 28:40.085
THE ORIGINAL COPYRIGHT ON

28:40.085 --> 28:41.286
WINNIE-THE-POOH EXPIRED.

28:41.286 --> 28:42.720
MEANING ANYONE IN THE U.S. CAN

28:42.720 --> 28:44.355
NOW FREELY USE THE CHARACTERS

28:44.355 --> 28:46.724
FROM THE ORIGINAL BOOK, WITHOUT

28:46.724 --> 28:48.359
HAVING TO PAY OR ASK PERMISSION.

28:48.359 --> 28:49.928
BUT IT TURNS OUT, WINNIE THE

28:49.928 --> 28:51.830
POOH ISN'T ACTUALLY THE ONLY

28:51.830 --> 28:53.298
MAJOR CHARACTER, OWNED BY

28:53.298 --> 28:55.200
DISNEY, ON THE PRECIPICE OF

28:55.200 --> 28:56.167
ENTERING PUBLIC DOMAIN.

28:56.167 --> 28:57.802
DISNEY COULD SOON LOSE ITS

28:57.802 --> 28:58.803
EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO ITS MOST

28:58.803 --> 28:59.904
ICONIC CHARACTER.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.272
THE COPYRIGHT FOR MICKEY MOUSE

29:01.272 --> 29:03.408
IS SET TO EXPIRE IN 2024, 95

29:03.408 --> 29:03.942
YEARS AFTER ITS FIRST

29:03.942 --> 29:09.347
PUBLICATION.

29:09.347 --> 29:09.781
IT'S TRUE!

29:09.781 --> 29:10.415
MICKEY MOUSE WILL SOON BE PUBLIC

29:10.415 --> 29:11.549
PROPERTY IN THE U.S.!

29:11.549 --> 29:13.451
WHICH IS A BIG DEAL, BECAUSE HIS

29:13.451 --> 29:14.853
COPYRIGHT IS A CLOSELY-GUARDED

29:14.853 --> 29:16.821
CORPORATE TREASURE, LIKE THE

29:16.821 --> 29:20.625
FORMULA TO COCA COLA, OR THE 11

29:20.625 --> 29:21.426
HERBS AND SPICES, OR

29:21.426 --> 29:22.994
WHERE MCDONALDS BURIED THE BODY

29:22.994 --> 29:23.828
OF MAYOR MCCHEESE.

29:23.828 --> 29:25.864
AND DISNEY'S BEEN WILDLY

29:25.864 --> 29:26.865
AGGRESSIVE IN DEFENDING ITS

29:26.865 --> 29:28.233
COPYRIGHTS OVER THE YEARS, AT

29:28.233 --> 29:29.567
ONE POINT, TELLING A STONEMASON

29:29.567 --> 29:31.035
THAT CARVING WINNIE THE POOH

29:31.035 --> 29:32.804
INTO A CHILD'S GRAVESTONE WOULD

29:32.804 --> 29:34.272
VIOLATE ITS COPYRIGHT, BEFORE

29:34.272 --> 29:35.773
ULTIMATELY RELENTING, LEADING TO

29:35.773 --> 29:37.242
THE EXCEPTIONAL HEADLINE,

29:37.242 --> 29:39.377
"DISNEY LIFTS POOH BEAR GRAVE

29:39.377 --> 29:41.446
BAN."

29:41.446 --> 29:42.080
SO CONGRATS, DISNEY.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.014
YOU REALLY CAME OFF AS THE GOOD

29:43.014 --> 29:47.752
GUY IN THAT ONE.

29:47.752 --> 29:49.654
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL, BECAUSE IN

29:49.654 --> 29:50.088
1989, THEY DID THIS.

29:50.088 --> 29:50.722
NOW DISNEY LAWYERS HAVE TAKEN

29:50.722 --> 29:51.689
AIM AT THIS FLORIDA DAY CARE

29:51.689 --> 29:52.390
CENTER, SAYING IT HAS NO RIGHT

29:52.390 --> 29:54.392
TO USE DISNEY CHARACTERS ON ITS

29:54.392 --> 29:55.260
WALLS.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.495
KIDS AND PARENTS HERE AT VERY

29:57.495 --> 29:58.263
IMPORTANT BABIES DON'T WANT TO

29:58.263 --> 29:59.264
LOSE MICKEY.

29:59.264 --> 30:00.798
I'LL FEEL SAD A LOT.

30:00.798 --> 30:01.366
IF THEY TOOK MICKEY DOWN?

30:01.366 --> 30:03.201
WHY?

30:03.201 --> 30:04.636
BECAUSE I LIKE HIM.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.137
AW, DON'T WORRY, BUDDY!

30:06.137 --> 30:07.839
NO ONE'S TAKING MICKEY AWAY.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.073
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO PAINT OVER

30:09.073 --> 30:09.507
HIM.

30:09.507 --> 30:10.742
SO HE'LL STILL BE THERE,

30:10.742 --> 30:11.743
INVISIBLE TO YOU, TRAPPED UNDER

30:11.743 --> 30:13.545
A THIN LAYER OF PAINT,

30:13.545 --> 30:14.546
TANTALIZINGLY CLOSE, BUT

30:14.546 --> 30:16.981
PERMANENTLY ALONE, IN A SORT OF

30:16.981 --> 30:18.149
LIMINAL UNDEATH.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.484
NOW RUN ALONG AND PLAY!

30:19.484 --> 30:21.152
HE'S WATCHING YOU, ALL THE TIME,

30:21.152 --> 30:24.389
YOU VERY IMPORTANT BABY!

30:24.389 --> 30:26.391
AND DISNEY HAS BEEN DESPERATE

30:26.391 --> 30:27.892
NOT TO SEE ITS COPYRIGHT ON

30:27.892 --> 30:28.726
MICKEY EXPIRE.

30:28.726 --> 30:30.161
IT WAS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO DO

30:30.161 --> 30:30.962
SO IN THE EARLY 2000S, BUT

30:30.962 --> 30:32.630
DISNEY, AMONG OTHERS,

30:32.630 --> 30:33.698
SUCCESSFULLY LOBBIED CONGRESS TO

30:33.698 --> 30:36.167
EXTEND IT ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS,

30:36.167 --> 30:36.668
IN A BILL THAT WAS EVEN

30:36.668 --> 30:39.003
NICKNAMED AT THE TIME "THE

30:39.003 --> 30:40.104
MICKEY MOUSE PROTECTION ACT."

30:40.104 --> 30:41.873
AND THE TRUTH IS, EVEN AFTER

30:41.873 --> 30:43.675
THIS NEW DEADLINE EXPIRES,

30:43.675 --> 30:45.210
DISNEY MAY STILL BE ABLE TO GO

30:45.210 --> 30:46.911
AFTER ANYONE USING MICKEY'S

30:46.911 --> 30:47.612
LIKENESS.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.080
BECAUSE CRUCIALLY, ONLY ONE

30:49.080 --> 30:51.015
PARTICULAR VERSION OF THE

30:51.015 --> 30:52.450
CHARACTER IS ABOUT TO BECOME

30:52.450 --> 30:53.251
FAIR GAME.

30:53.251 --> 30:54.519
NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT ONLY

30:54.519 --> 30:56.354
THE VERY FIRST VERSION OF MICKEY

30:56.354 --> 30:57.522
IS THE ONE THAT WILL BE STRIPPED

30:57.522 --> 30:58.890
OF ITS COPYRIGHT.

30:58.890 --> 31:00.458
THAT'S THE 1928 BLACK-AND-WHITE

31:00.458 --> 31:03.394
VERSION WHERE MICKEY'S ON THE

31:03.394 --> 31:05.730
STEAMBOAT AND BACK THEN MICKEY

31:05.730 --> 31:06.631
LOOKED MORE RAT-LIKE.

31:06.631 --> 31:07.899
DISNEY WILL RETAIN ITS COPYRIGHT

31:07.899 --> 31:09.968
ON ANY SUBSEQUENT VARIATIONS AND

31:09.968 --> 31:11.603
OTHER FILMS OR ARTWORK UNTIL

31:11.603 --> 31:18.509
THEY REACH THE 95 YEAR MARK.

31:18.509 --> 31:19.744
SHE'S RIGHTTRUE.

31:19.744 --> 31:22.714
SHE'S RIGHT.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.314
THE U.S. COPYRIGHT IS ONLY SET

31:23.314 --> 31:23.881
TO EXPIRE FOR THE ORIGINAL,

31:23.881 --> 31:24.482
"STEAMBOAT WILLIE" VERSION OF

31:24.482 --> 31:24.716
MICKEY.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.350
DISNEY'S COPYRIGHT STILL APPLIES

31:25.350 --> 31:25.950
TO THE LATER VERSIONS IN WHICH

31:25.950 --> 31:26.551
MICKEY GIVES OFF STRONG DIANE

31:26.551 --> 31:27.619
KEATON VIBES, BY WHICH I MEAN,

31:27.619 --> 31:28.353
HE'S UNCONTROLLABLY HORNY WHILE

31:28.353 --> 31:31.723
WEARING GLOVES.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.991
ON TOP OF WHICH, DISNEY HAS

31:32.991 --> 31:34.192
REGISTERED TRADEMARKS RELATED TO

31:34.192 --> 31:35.093
MICKEY.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.794
WHICH DON'T EXPIRE.

31:36.794 --> 31:38.129
IN FACT, SOME HAVE SPECULATED

31:38.129 --> 31:39.897
THAT THAT MAY BE WHY DISNEY

31:39.897 --> 31:41.633
REDESIGNED ITS ANIMATION STUDIOS

31:41.633 --> 31:44.769
OPENING LOGO TO INCORPORATE THE

31:44.769 --> 31:47.472
STEAMBOAT WILLIE MICKEY MOUSE.

31:47.472 --> 31:48.106
AND IT DOES FEEL LIKE A TACTICAL

31:48.106 --> 31:49.107
LEGAL MOVE.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.776
BASICALLY, THEY MAY ARGUE THAT

31:51.776 --> 31:53.878
THIS EARLY MICKEY'S IMAGE IS SO

31:53.878 --> 31:54.479
CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR

31:54.479 --> 31:57.315
COMPANY THAT PEOPLE WILL ASSUME

31:57.315 --> 31:57.949
ANY IMAGE OF HIM WAS PRODUCED OR

31:57.949 --> 31:58.883
AUTHORIZED BY THEM, AND STILL

31:58.883 --> 32:00.918
TAKE LEGAL ACTION.

32:00.918 --> 32:02.720
SO THE FACT IS, ANYONE WANTING

32:02.720 --> 32:04.622
TO USE THE "STEAMBOAT WILLIE"

32:04.622 --> 32:05.890
MICKEY MOUSE, WILL PROBABLY

32:05.890 --> 32:07.125
STILL BE TAKING A RISK.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.926
BUT IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

32:08.926 --> 32:10.161
THIS SHOW BY NOW, YOU KNOW WE DO

32:10.161 --> 32:13.331
LIKE TO TAKE A RISK EVERY NOW

32:13.331 --> 32:14.465
AND THEN.

32:14.465 --> 32:15.566
AND THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID FOR

32:15.566 --> 32:17.802
BEATING THE RUSH TO CAPITALIZE

32:17.802 --> 32:19.704
ON MICKEY THAT'LL START NEXT

32:19.704 --> 32:20.138
YEAR.

32:20.138 --> 32:22.974
SO TONIGHT, I'D LIKE TO PREVIEW

32:22.974 --> 32:24.208
FOR YOU A BRAND NEW CHARACTER ON

32:24.208 --> 32:26.744
OUR SHOW, MICKEY MOUSE!

32:26.744 --> 32:27.679
OH, BOY!

32:27.679 --> 32:28.946
HEY THERE, JOHN!

32:28.946 --> 32:32.383
HEY THERE, MICKEY!

32:32.383 --> 32:33.484
IT'S SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH

32:33.484 --> 32:33.651
US!

32:33.651 --> 32:34.052
WHERE'S

32:34.052 --> 32:34.919
SHELLEY MISCAVIGE?

32:34.919 --> 32:36.721
OH, MICKEY, THERE'S THE

32:36.721 --> 32:37.822
CLASSIC CATCHPHRASE YOU'RE GOING

32:37.822 --> 32:39.290
TO BE DOING EVERY TIME YOU'RE ON

32:39.290 --> 32:40.391
THIS SHOW FROM NOW ON!

32:40.391 --> 32:41.726
YOU KNOW, THE NICE THING ABOUT

32:41.726 --> 32:43.394
CHARACTERS ENTERING THE PUBLIC

32:43.394 --> 32:44.195
DOMAIN IS, YOU CAN DO NEW,

32:44.195 --> 32:46.497
INTERESTING THINGS WITH THEM!

32:46.497 --> 32:48.166
I THOUGHT I WASN'T

32:48.166 --> 32:49.467
PUBLIC DOMAIN UNTIL NEXT YEAR!

32:49.467 --> 32:52.036
THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE,

32:52.036 --> 32:53.838
BUDDY, WE ARE PUSHING THE LIMIT

32:53.838 --> 32:59.110
A BIT HERE.

32:59.110 --> 32:59.711
ACTUALLY, COME TO THINK OF IT,

32:59.711 --> 33:00.345
IS YOUR VOICE PUBLIC DOMAIN YET?

33:00.345 --> 33:00.945
I GUESS YOU'LL FIND

33:00.945 --> 33:01.112
OUT!

33:01.112 --> 33:01.779
YEAH, I GUESS WE WILL!

33:01.779 --> 33:02.347
I HOPE HENRY

33:02.347 --> 33:04.615
KISSINGER DIES SOON!

33:04.615 --> 33:05.283
OH, ME TOO, MICKEY!

33:05.283 --> 33:06.818
CONSIDER THAT YOUR SECOND

33:06.818 --> 33:11.022
CATCHPHRASE!

33:11.022 --> 33:11.522
BYE!

33:11.522 --> 33:12.357
THE POINT IS, WE'RE STAKING OUR

33:12.357 --> 33:12.990
CLAIM TO MICKEY MOUSE RIGHT NOW.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.059
AND I KNOW DISNEY'S LAWYERS

33:15.059 --> 33:15.960
MIGHT TAKE THE TRADEMARK ANGLE,

33:15.960 --> 33:18.096
AND ARGUE THAT THIS MICKEY IS

33:18.096 --> 33:18.796
CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR

33:18.796 --> 33:19.397
BRAND.

33:19.397 --> 33:20.832
ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD KNOW, HE'S

33:20.832 --> 33:27.538
PRETTY CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH

33:27.538 --> 33:28.172
OUR BRAND NOW, TOO, AND NOT JUST

33:28.172 --> 33:28.773
BECAUSE I HAVE A GENERAL VIBE

33:28.773 --> 33:29.307
THAT SCREAMS "95-YEAR-OLD

33:29.307 --> 33:30.408
RAT-FACED IDIOT."

33:30.408 --> 33:31.542
BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE "STEAMBOAT

33:31.542 --> 33:32.777
WILLIE" MICKEY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

33:32.777 --> 33:34.545
IN OUR OPENING CREDITS SINCE THE

33:34.545 --> 33:37.548
FIRST SHOW OF THIS SEASON.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.650
AND I DON'T DOUBT DISNEY HAS

33:39.650 --> 33:41.419
SOME OTHER LEGAL ARGUMENTS UP

33:41.419 --> 33:42.353
THEIR SLEEVE, BUT WE'RE ONLY

33:42.353 --> 33:44.188
LIKELY TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE

33:44.188 --> 33:49.260
IF AND WHEN THEY SUE.

33:49.260 --> 33:49.761
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:49.761 --> 33:50.695
LET'S TAKE THIS UP A NOTCH.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.898
COME SAY HI, MICKEY!

33:53.898 --> 33:56.667
COME ON, MICKEY!

33:56.667 --> 33:57.335
OH, THAT'S NICE.

33:57.335 --> 34:00.638
HERE HE IS!

34:00.638 --> 34:01.272
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:01.272 --> 34:02.640
AND GREAT NEWS, AS OF JANUARY 1

34:02.640 --> 34:05.076
NEXT YEAR, THIS MASCOT COSTUME

34:05.076 --> 34:06.677
WILL BE AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR

34:06.677 --> 34:08.513
BIRTHDAY PARTIES, THEME PARK

34:08.513 --> 34:09.313
OPENINGS, FUNERALS, SEX DUNGEONS

34:09.313 --> 34:11.582
BASICALLY, WHATEVER YOU WANT

34:11.582 --> 34:12.049
TO USE IT FOR.

34:12.049 --> 34:13.518
HEY THERE, MICKEY!

34:13.518 --> 34:15.987
WHERE'S SHELLEY?

34:15.987 --> 34:16.754
OH, THERE HE GOES

34:16.754 --> 34:18.523
AGAIN!

34:18.523 --> 34:19.791
JEFFREY EPSTEIN

34:19.791 --> 34:22.360
DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF!

34:22.360 --> 34:23.060
OH, THAT'S THREE

34:23.060 --> 34:25.229
CATCHPHRASES!

34:25.229 --> 34:27.732
2024 IS ONLY 274 DAYS AWAY!

34:27.732 --> 34:31.135
THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS!

34:31.135 --> 34:34.639
THAT IS OUR SHOW, THANKS SO MUCH

34:34.639 --> 34:37.942
FOR WATCHING.

34:37.942 --> 34:38.476
WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

34:38.476 --> 34:38.943
GOOD NIGHT!
