01:30.825 --> 01:34.293
I wanted to go
someplace special tonight.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.829
Romantic.

01:36.831 --> 01:40.599
If you've met someone wonderful,
then you should spoil them.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.501
It's important to find
that special person

01:42.503 --> 01:45.504
you can be
yourself around.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.640
Someone you could spend
the rest of your life with.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.343
This calls
for a toast.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.645
Here's to relationships.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.816
To first dates

02:03.791 --> 02:05.324
Would you excuse
me for a minute?

02:05.326 --> 02:06.525
Of course.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.187
What's up, Myles?

02:35.189 --> 02:38.357
He's so cute and smart.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.725
I really like him.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.360
I think he may be the one.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.195
What kind of puppy
did you pick out?

02:43.197 --> 02:44.429
Puppy?

02:44.431 --> 02:47.199
The one you're imagining
in your dream house.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.935
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.171
Boston Terrier

02:52.173 --> 02:54.190
Where are you?

02:54.191 --> 02:56.208
No, don't tell me.
Let me guess.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.943
You're only gonna
need one guess.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.212
God I wish you
could see this.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.480
This guy's ass is so
tight you could bounce
a quarter off of it.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.882
Or something bigger.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.785
Nice visual while I enjoy
my romantic dinner.

03:06.787 --> 03:10.822
Well, my date and I are
sharing a connection,

03:10.824 --> 03:12.858
deep meaningful conversation.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.628
I took him to this
amazing restaurant.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.430
Just gave him
the red rose.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.769
He's leaving, isn't he?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.837
He just slipped
out the door.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.639
Oh Myles.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.943
Time to initiate
our suicide pact.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.678
I fear the
time is upon us.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.613
Death by chocolate?

03:34.615 --> 03:36.248
I'm afraid so.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.549
Text me where you are.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.620
You owe me an orgasm.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.755
I'll make it a
double next time.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.924
Is there gonna
be a next time?

03:48.262 --> 03:49.394
Probably not.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.732
Do you wanna shower at
least before you go?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.234
I didn't break a sweat.

It was before my
date left me.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.689
Here, this will
cheer you up.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.824
What's this?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.260
It's your birthday present.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.928
My birthday isn't
for two months yet.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.798
I know, I figured you could
use a little "happy" now.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.766
Why hello.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.436
Oh, you got my favorite!

04:31.438 --> 04:32.671
Of course.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.441
Don't get too excited,
it's not much.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.613
Oh come on, don't
get all gushy on me.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.350
You do have a
sentimental side.

04:45.352 --> 04:47.319
That's the
day we met.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.287
I made two of them. One
for you and one for me.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.659
I just wanted to do
something that you would like.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.761
Don't make me regret
being nice, alright.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.014
Do me a favor. Don't
let me die alone.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.916
You're not gonna be alone.
I'm gonna be there holding

05:17.918 --> 05:20.852
a pillow over
your face.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.055
This is to the hangovers
we're gonna have tomorrow.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.523
So we agree?

05:24.525 --> 05:26.058
To being hungover?

05:26.060 --> 05:27.359
No.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.860
That we won't
grow old alone.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.463
I'm never
gonna be alone.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.999
In fact, I'm already
drafting a list in my head

05:34.001 --> 05:35.967
of all the things I'm
gonna do to our waiter.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.870
Most of them are still
illegal in forty-two states.

Alright, I can tell you're
obsessing over this already.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.683
I'll make you a deal.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.752
If in ten years we're
both still single

05:53.754 --> 05:56.588
and neither of us
have found anybody,

05:56.590 --> 06:01.793
we'll be boyfriends. A
couple. Together, forever.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.663

be a fancy attorney.

I will sign it.

years then?

want dinner to burn.

Eggplant Sorrento?

07:44.231 --> 07:46.532
Well you've been
working a lot recently,

07:46.533 --> 07:48.834
so I thought it would
be nice to do something
extra special for you.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.036
I can't believe
you called my mother.

come out with me tonight, huh.

will get you an ass so hot

have the same equipment as me.

who I am. I mean,

you have sent me so
many pictures of yourself

than your own doctor does.

you to my friend.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.021
You want me to come over?

13:10.023 --> 13:12.657
That depends.

13:12.658 --> 13:15.292
Do you like strawberries
infused with cognac hand
dipped in dark chocolate?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.895
Strawberries and cognac?

13:16.897 --> 13:18.096
Can I come?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.264
You already did.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.999
Twice.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.066
I'll be right there.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.946
Since when did you start
fucking Martha Stuart?

13:34.948 --> 13:37.282
One does what one has
to, to get a man.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.850
I've had a lot of men,

13:38.852 --> 13:42.420
I have never injected a
strawberry with cognac before.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.156
Well, not in the
literal sense.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.828
It doesn't
matter anyway.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.930
I'm done. I'm in
my mid-thirties.

13:51.932 --> 13:55.567
Time to acknowledge the
fact that I'm destined
to be a gay spinster.

13:55.569 --> 13:59.304
If the thought of dog hair
everywhere didn't disgust
me, I'd be a gay cliche.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.206
Trust me.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.107
You don't need a small
dog to be a gay cliche.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.409
Thanks.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.278
Either way, I'm
tired and done.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.348
I'm sick of chasing
men only to have my
heart broken every time.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.133
Ok, enough.

14:12.134 --> 14:13.917
I'm taking you shopping. If
you're going to be single,

14:13.920 --> 14:15.019
you need the
proper tools.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.487
I'm afraid of
you right now.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.256
You're smarter
than you look.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.457
Come on.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.328

14:23.330 --> 14:27.398
If I know you, a kinky
evening of sex means
using your left hand

14:27.400 --> 14:31.102
and your toy arsenal is
nothing more than a two
year old jar of lube.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.105
Look being single requires
the proper equipment

14:34.107 --> 14:37.909
and there's no better
place to get it than here!

14:37.911 --> 14:38.910
Fleshjack.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.612
Better than a real mouth.
Why?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.550
Because it doesn't speak.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.053
Dildo. No more
gambling with what's on
the other side of the zipper.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.990
Nothing is worse than
unwrapping the whopper
only to find they

14:51.992 --> 14:54.943
skimped on the pickle.

Now you can come home to
Jeff Stryker every night.

Now, you can watch your favorite
pornos in HD above your head!

15:04.571 --> 15:07.405
I can see you've done extensive
research on the subject.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.274
Hey. I may not be
good at many things,

15:09.276 --> 15:12.176

at, I'm an expert in.

15:23.272 --> 15:24.188
Thank you very much,
enjoy sir.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.095
I can't believe you
make me eat here.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.647
Are you kidding me?

15:32.648 --> 15:34.198
Everyone knows the best food
in LA comes from food trucks.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.434
Yeah, so does E. Coli.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.269
Hey, I got you something.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.540
Its a sex toy.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.443
If this goes where
I think it goes,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.979
you and I are gonna have
a big problem, buddy.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.297
It doesn't.

15:49.298 --> 15:50.614
Trust me, you're
going to like this.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.051
I went shopping with
Myles last night.

15:53.053 --> 15:56.054
I was trying to cheer him
up, he just broke up with
his newest boyfriend.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.188
Another one?

15:57.190 --> 15:59.057
I feel so bad
for that guy.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.525
Yeah, me too.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.060
Myles is a bit much.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.461
No, I meant Myles.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.532
You feel bad for Myles.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.401
Don't. If you want to
pity someone, try me.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.071
Myles and I made a deal
ten years ago that if
we were still single

16:13.073 --> 16:16.074
by the time we're
thirty-five, we'd be a couple.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.626
That's ridiculous.

16:17.627 --> 16:19.177
Myles is a successful,
smart lawyer.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.144
He can do so much
better than you.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.312
I know, right.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.897
Wait, what?

16:22.898 --> 16:24.481
I don't even know why
you're complaining. I
think it's a great idea.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.217
You'd be lucky to have
a guy like Myles.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.353
That is the last thing
in the world I need.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.655
You're crazy, but
we both know that.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.690
Seems like if you don't want
to be Myles next boyfriend,

16:32.692 --> 16:35.660
you're going to have to do
something about it - quick.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.396
Myles turns thirty-five
in one month,

16:38.398 --> 16:40.631
we have thirty days to
find Myles a boyfriend.

Yeah, can I get
you a drink?

17:01.588 --> 17:02.787
I trained you well.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.355
Nope, I got it.

place, I didn't have time
to go back to the station.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.195
Sure, whatever
you need to do.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.603
Ah. I waited all
day for that.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.038
What are
you looking at?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.607
I rarely see you
in uniform.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.142
You like a
man in uniform?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.077
Who doesn't?

17:26.079 --> 17:28.430
What do you think?

17:28.431 --> 17:30.782
I think you look less
like a real cop and more
like a male stripper.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.720
No wonder you're so easily
able to catch the bad guys.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.422
Oh really?

17:37.424 --> 17:39.223

broken a few laws

a little "hard time."

18:17.097 --> 18:17.862

18:17.864 --> 18:20.264
Yeah, we should go.

guy has to get his gay on.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.122
If you're worried about
not being gay enough,

18:44.124 --> 18:48.259
I'd say you're good for the
next...year, maybe ten.

you and gogo bars?

You shouldn't snub your
nose at gogo bars.

They are an important tool in
the gay mans sexual arsenal.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.218

dipped strawberries?

19:14.220 --> 19:15.786
Yes and No.

romance and more sex.

a sexy male dancer.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.106
Yes, exactly, SEXY!

19:35.107 --> 19:37.574
Men are visual animals. We see
a hot guy, we get turned on.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.444
Gogo boys are just
eye candy here to

19:40.446 --> 19:44.215
stimulate our adrenaline and
boost our testosterone.

19:44.450 --> 19:48.052
Ok.

19:48.053 --> 19:51.655
So, they're here to tease.
You can't have them, you can
just look and gently touch.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.426
This is all fine,

19:55.428 --> 19:57.428

to do with me.

cares about me.

has sex with me

up muscle twink in a g-string.

for the next decade

21:16.509 --> 21:19.594

Do you have any idea what its
like to have an ovary full of
eggs screaming "fertilize me?"

21:22.682 --> 21:25.616
It adds a whole new dimension
to the misery of being single.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.551
No, and I don't want to either.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.604
In fact, I'd rather
not discuss it.

21:29.605 --> 21:31.656
Being gay does not excuse you
from having to deal with this.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.625
I'm pretty sure it does.

Besides, I'm newly
single now too.

for you and Brody to be
a couple, how sweet.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.802
No! And when did I
tell you about that?

21:47.674 --> 21:49.907
If I know Brody, he's probably
forgotten all about it.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.459
Remind him.

21:51.460 --> 21:53.010
And videotape his
expression when you do.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.979
It'll be a good one.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.348

remembering our little plan.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.517
Why? He's a great
catch, and so hot.

21:59.519 --> 22:02.420
But he's not
relationship material.

don't sleep with your friends.

I was about to get into this
big, soft bed without some
strange guy next to me,

25:34.700 --> 25:36.734
snoring and farting his
way through the night.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.237
You sound miserable.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.805
I am.

25:44.977 --> 25:50.147
I'm going to find you
the perfect guy.

25:50.149 --> 25:53.501
No, no.

25:53.502 --> 25:56.854
Dude, I'm your best friend.
Who is more qualified than
me to find a guy for you?

25:56.856 --> 26:01.258
Your argument is compelling,
and as always, disconcerting.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.726
Trust me.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.962
I've met a lot of great
guys over the years.

26:04.964 --> 26:08.098
If I wasn't a confirmed
bachelor, I would have
scooped one up myself.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.268
But hey, my
loss is your gain.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.304
I'm going to find you
a husband, buddy.

26:13.306 --> 26:16.173
You better get buckle up, cause
we're going on a manhunt.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.808
I'll brace for impact.

26:17.810 --> 26:18.909
Bye.

26:22.315 --> 26:23.714
Hi, I'm Myles.

26:23.716 --> 26:24.982
It's really nice
to meet you.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.117
Brody told me a
lot about you.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.453
I'm Stu.

26:29.454 --> 26:31.788
It's so funny you
picked this place. It's
my favorite coffee shop...

26:31.791 --> 26:33.257
and you bought
me an eclair,

26:33.259 --> 26:35.025
I love these.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.595
Here's a double
decaf soy latte, too.

26:37.597 --> 26:40.097
I like to do my research
before I meet someone.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.267
When you say "you like to
do your research before
you meet someone,"

26:43.269 --> 26:44.935
What exactly do you
mean by that?

26:44.937 --> 26:47.838
I like to know
who I'm meeting.

26:47.839 --> 26:50.740
I just do a standard
Google, Facebook, LinkedIn
search before I meet them.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.142
You know, see
if we're compatible.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.678
Find out what you're into.

26:54.680 --> 26:59.249
So, you do this kind
of investigation with
every guy you go out with?

26:59.251 --> 27:01.352
It helps me to come up with
some things to talk about.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.354
There's nothing
worse than meeting a
guy for the first time

27:03.356 --> 27:06.790
and having nothing
to talk about.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.660
My research also helps me
do things like this...

27:13.065 --> 27:15.733
It's your
favorite flower.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.635
I also know you played
lacrosse in high school.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.971
You love to go camping
and you have a French
Bulldog named Doug.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.274
Could you excuse
me for one moment?

27:24.276 --> 27:26.143
I need to use
the restroom.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.112
Do you want me to
order for you?

27:28.114 --> 27:30.748
Vanilla latte with
extra foam, extra hot.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.116
Right?

27:32.118 --> 27:34.318
Oh wow. My sister
just texted.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
She swallowed
a rusty nail.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.789
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to take her to the hospital.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.993
Call me.

27:47.433 --> 27:53.103
(VIDEO GAME SOUNDS)
(PHONE RINGS)

27:53.105 --> 27:54.004
What's up?

27:54.006 --> 27:55.673
Ok, I officially give up.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.776
No more men.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.878
Ok, let's start with the mildly
over-dramatic and work our way
back to the partially sane.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.048
I'm like kryptonite
to my Superman.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.316
I'll never find
someone to love me.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.952
You're probably just coming
on too strong, buddy.

28:08.954 --> 28:12.990
You just need to relax,
get to know someone,
have a little fun.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.092
So it is me?

28:15.094 --> 28:17.395
It's not you.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.697
Look, I'm just setting you
up with the wrong guys,
give me one more chance.

28:19.699 --> 28:20.921
No.

28:20.922 --> 28:22.144
I'm heading straight
to the kennel.

28:22.145 --> 28:23.367
I'm going to pick out
a little white dog

28:23.369 --> 28:25.936
and spend the rest
of my days alone.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.839
Come on, one more chance.
One more date, I promise.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.993
Ok.

28:32.994 --> 28:35.111
I'll consider one more
date, under one condition.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.314
It's non-negotiable.

28:37.316 --> 28:40.417
What are your terms, counselor?

28:40.419 --> 28:41.852
Will you come with?

28:41.854 --> 28:43.420
Oh God.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.806
I won't do this alone.

28:45.807 --> 28:48.191
You pick out a date for me, and
I'll pick out someone for you.

28:48.194 --> 28:51.361
If you're there then
you'll get to witness the
disaster first hand.

28:51.363 --> 28:54.431
It's like having
box seats at a

28:54.433 --> 28:56.650
NASCAR event
where you know

28:56.651 --> 28:58.868
there's going to be a multi-car
pile up before it's all over.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.137
Well as long as
you're going into

29:00.139 --> 29:02.272
it with such
a positive attitude.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.175
Positive that I'm going
to end up alone again at
the end of the evening.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.376
Bye.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.754
I hope you
like this place.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.355
They have the best
stuffed mushrooms.

29:18.357 --> 29:19.890
I love stuffed
mushrooms.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.793
I had them the last
time I was...

29:22.795 --> 29:24.428
when my date
decided to ditch me.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.898
Oh, sorry.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.517
Well,

29:29.518 --> 29:31.135
Hopefully, tonight will
be better for you.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.836
Here's to not being
dumped tonight.

29:32.838 --> 29:33.904
Wow, sorry.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.839
Myles can be a tad
bit depressing.

29:35.841 --> 29:38.375
Hence having the waiter
remove all the sharp
objects from the table.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.777
You're an asshole.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.081
You don't recognize
me, do you?

29:46.051 --> 29:47.351
Grindr.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.789
I tried to message you
a couple times, but...

29:51.791 --> 29:53.490
you never responded.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.893
I'm sorry, I'm not really
good with technology.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.228
I'm just a
simple farm boy.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.864
Oh yeah? Where
are you from?

30:00.866 --> 30:02.499
New York.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.135
How was the harvest in
Manhattan this season?

30:07.940 --> 30:09.907
I'm originally from Colombia.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.341
My parents are farmers.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.443
Organic coffee trade.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.913
There's no such thing
as organic coffee.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.849
I hear it's just a
marketing ploy to drive
up the cost of beans.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.619
My family's in the
coffee business, too.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.388
We sell espresso machines and
roasted beans...mostly organic.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.257
What's your family name?

30:27.259 --> 30:28.258
Fiori.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.227
I've heard that name before.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.129
I think my family supplies
your coffee beans.

30:32.131 --> 30:32.996
Get out of here.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.031
I'm serious.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.599
I'm a total coffee whore.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.869
A double decaf latte, extra
soy, extra foam, extra hot.

30:38.871 --> 30:42.840
You don't want to know
what I'd do for one of those
before work in the morning.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.692
And you said it
was just a little

30:44.693 --> 30:46.543
vanilla froth on the corner
of your mouth the other day.

30:46.545 --> 30:50.113
Hey, what goes on between my
barista and I is my business.

30:51.217 --> 30:52.382
Do you know Vincent?

30:54.086 --> 30:56.119
Vincent Fiori. He's
only my brother!

30:56.121 --> 30:57.888
Are you serious?

30:57.890 --> 30:58.555
Yes.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.357
What an awesome guy.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.158
Yeah, Vincent's been
trying to get me to travel
with him for years.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.261
I think he's even told
me about your farm.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.062
No way.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.014
Yes.

31:07.015 --> 31:08.965
We have one thousand
acres of the lushest
farmland you've ever seen.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.968
So how about them Dodgers?

31:10.970 --> 31:13.254
I don't follow sports.

31:13.255 --> 31:15.539
Sports are what straight guys
talk about when they have
nothing better to say, come on!

31:15.541 --> 31:18.242
Yeah, right.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.944
I'm starting to regret having
the waiter remove those sharp
objects from the table.

31:20.946 --> 31:24.047
Yeah, I know. Give me a
minute and I'll forge a
shiv out of a breadstick.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.616
Do you think they'll
notice if we left?

31:25.618 --> 31:28.151
I've always wanted to
be the guy that leaves.

31:28.153 --> 31:31.188
Myles. That is a horrible
thing to do to your date.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.155
I know, you're right.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.074
I'm sorry.

31:34.075 --> 31:35.992
I didn't say we shouldn't
do it. I just said it was a
horrible thing to do.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.095
Which makes it
so much fun!

31:38.097 --> 31:40.464
Excuse me.

31:40.466 --> 31:41.899
I'm going to go too.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.443
"Fiori."

31:53.445 --> 31:55.545
Well that went
predictably bad.

31:57.950 --> 32:01.218
I'll give you that much.
Tonight needs to end
with a stiff drink.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.386
Scotch?

32:02.388 --> 32:05.156
No, I got a big
meeting tomorrow.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.925
Come on, hang out, chill.
You don't have to rush
home to Jeff Stryker.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.326
Jeff Stryker?

32:12.064 --> 32:13.597
Oh, the dildo?

32:16.001 --> 32:16.700
Here.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.238
You know I can send
my cleaning lady
over if you want.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.308
She's only seventy-five
bucks a visit. She'll
bring her own napalm.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.143
Hey, I made a path
to the couch.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.478
That counts for
something, right?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.213
You need someone to
take care of you.

32:30.215 --> 32:33.283
No, I need to hire a maid.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.085
Everyone needs
someone. Even you.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.204
What are you afraid of?

32:37.205 --> 32:39.322
Of being nagged to
death about being single.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.625
Oh, we need to
get you a man.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.293
Give me your phone.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.166
Alright, take your shirt off.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.067
What?

32:50.069 --> 32:52.386
Take your shirt off.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.704
No. You're not putting
half naked pictures of
me up on the internet.

32:54.707 --> 32:55.639
No way.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.308
It's not the internet.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.976
It's an app and
everyone does it.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.979
Look, you need to try something
different for a change.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.580
No.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.282
How do you do it?

33:05.284 --> 33:09.152
Very well and often
on all fours.

33:09.154 --> 33:12.689
Trust me, it is better
than being alone.

33:12.691 --> 33:15.158
I'm really not
comfortable with this.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.195
It's all about advertising.
If you want to catch a fish,

33:18.197 --> 33:20.097
you've got to show
him your worm.

33:20.099 --> 33:23.266
No one is
seeing my "worm",

33:23.268 --> 33:25.602
and the shirt stays on.
It's non-negotiable.

33:25.604 --> 33:26.536
Fine.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.071
Leave the shirt on.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.639
Now smile and say,

33:29.641 --> 33:33.677
"I'm a bad little boy who's
looking for a sexy daddy."

33:33.679 --> 33:35.412
"Cheese"

33:37.549 --> 33:39.549
"Cheese" will do.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.389
Look at that!

33:45.391 --> 33:46.189
Oh my god.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.057
It's beautiful.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.559
No its not.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.060
It's awful, delete it.

33:50.062 --> 33:51.528
No way.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.099
I've got to delete this.

33:58.337 --> 34:00.570
(BEEP)

34:00.572 --> 34:03.073
Wow, ok.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.608
(BEEP)

34:04.610 --> 34:06.243
Wow.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.310
(BEEP)

34:07.312 --> 34:09.346
Now?

34:11.784 --> 34:17.821
*

34:35.107 --> 34:36.639
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

34:42.581 --> 34:44.313
Cute.

34:44.315 --> 34:48.518
I like the "Abercrombie meets

34:48.520 --> 34:52.155
Log-Cabin-Republic can"
thing you've got going on.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.491
I have to tell you I've never
done this kind of thing before.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.460
And what kind of thing is that?

34:56.462 --> 34:58.695
Meet up with a guy I don't know
in the middle of the night.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.130
And what do you
think so far?

35:00.132 --> 35:02.099
I'm nervous.

35:02.101 --> 35:04.434
How adorable. You
want to come in?

35:04.436 --> 35:07.104
You're not going to
kill me, are you?

35:07.106 --> 35:09.172
Do you really think that someone
who is planning on killing you,

35:09.174 --> 35:13.143
is going to answer that
question with a yes?

35:13.145 --> 35:15.712
Feel like taking
your chances?

35:15.714 --> 35:19.583
I wasn't planning on
revealing I was this
neurotic until much later.

35:19.585 --> 35:22.219
The cat's out of the bag now.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.454
Offer still stands.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.379
Can I get you a drink?

35:49.381 --> 35:51.348
I've got whiskey, beer, vodka.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.782
I'm fine.

35:52.784 --> 35:54.384
Hit?

35:54.386 --> 35:56.520
No, I'm good.

35:56.522 --> 35:57.621
You mind?

35:57.623 --> 35:58.855
No.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.395
Are you sure?

36:05.397 --> 36:07.197
No, I'm fine.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.435
So what happens now?

36:14.306 --> 36:15.939
Whatever you want.

36:21.780 --> 36:27.584
I don't bite...
very hard at first.

36:27.586 --> 36:28.885
Sure I can't
change your mind

36:28.887 --> 36:30.453
about that drink?

36:32.858 --> 36:34.357
Make it a double.

(FACETIME RINGING)

36:50.509 --> 36:51.575
What's up, buddy?

36:51.577 --> 36:54.911
Hey, I took your advice.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.246
Where are you?

36:56.248 --> 36:59.382
I'm at this seriously
hot guy's house.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.785
Don't even say you did it,
I will not believe you.

37:01.787 --> 37:04.354
This is, so hot.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.422
Where are you?

37:05.424 --> 37:06.823
His name is Hunter.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.359
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.995
Shh. Here he comes. I gotta
go; I'll call you later.

37:16.468 --> 37:17.434
Hey, wait...

37:17.435 --> 37:18.401
Was that your backup plan?

37:18.403 --> 37:20.303
Oh, no it's just my buddy.

37:20.305 --> 37:23.506
He always calls me when
he meets a hot guy so...

37:25.544 --> 37:27.944
I just called him.

37:27.946 --> 37:28.712
(PHONE RINGING)

37:28.714 --> 37:30.680
I'm flattered.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.015
I'm sorry.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.283
You can get it if you want.

37:33.285 --> 37:39.322
One second.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.261
What do you want?

37:44.263 --> 37:45.428
What are you doing?

37:45.430 --> 37:46.863
I'm taking your advice.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.365
My advice?

37:48.367 --> 37:50.300
Yeah, meet people and have fun.

37:50.302 --> 37:51.585
Look, I gotta go.

37:51.586 --> 37:52.869
I don't want to be rude.
I'll call you later.

37:52.871 --> 37:53.970
Hey wait.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.538
No, I'll call you later.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.846
That was ridiculous I know.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.648
Now I'm embarrassed.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.582
No.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.350
Don't worry, it was sweet.

38:09.454 --> 38:13.056
Well if there's no one
else you'd like to
ring up at midnight,

38:13.058 --> 38:15.659
are you ready to get
to know each other?

38:17.496 --> 38:20.497
Do you mind if we just
hang out tonight?

38:20.499 --> 38:21.865
Oh.

38:21.867 --> 38:25.402
Okay - no worries.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.804
I'm down with whatever.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.539
You sure?

38:29.541 --> 38:30.807
Yeah, that's fine.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.978
I just assumed that
was what you wanted.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.815
I'm not really like that.

38:38.817 --> 38:39.916
Me neither.

38:39.918 --> 38:42.352
I'm really just a simple,

38:42.354 --> 38:45.355
romantic homebody.

38:45.357 --> 38:49.359
I'm good with just
hanging out tonight.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.695
That's very cool of you.

38:51.697 --> 38:54.764
You just seem like a
really great guy.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.366
I do.

39:01.073 --> 39:06.609
You know...if you want to put
your hand on my leg again, I
won't freak out, I promise.

Aww.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.926
How Sweet.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.096
Well that was certainly hot.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.865
I needed that.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.000
Apparently several times.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.568
Listen, I need to go,

40:05.570 --> 40:07.904
I have class.

40:07.906 --> 40:08.972
Oh.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.440
What are you studying?

40:10.442 --> 40:12.742
It's an aerobics class.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.676
Oh.

40:13.678 --> 40:14.644
Is it tough?

40:14.646 --> 40:17.647
It's actually quite fun.

40:17.648 --> 40:20.649
No. I mean getting back
to the 1980's when they
actually taught aerobics.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.652
It's coming back,
I'll have you know.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.021
I'll have to remember to
tell my leg warmers that.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.690
What are leg warmers?

40:27.692 --> 40:29.559
You're kidding, right?

40:29.561 --> 40:32.829
No, and unfortunately I
don't have time to find out.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.465
I need to leave,

there at eleven.

Oh my god!
It's eleven?!

(PHONE RINGING)

40:47.512 --> 40:50.180
Hey, what happened to
you? You never called
me back last night.

40:50.182 --> 40:52.081
It's Diane.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.083
Brody, do you know
where Myles is?

40:54.085 --> 40:56.486
Well did you try him at home?

40:56.488 --> 40:58.955
It's a wonder you're
not a detective yet.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.058
Uh. I don't know. I haven't
seen him since last night.

41:02.060 --> 41:05.895
Well, he had a client
meeting on the books at
9:30 and he missed it.

41:05.897 --> 41:10.233
Ok. Let me go check in
on him. I'll get back
to you in ten minutes.

41:10.235 --> 41:11.668
Thank you.

41:13.538 --> 41:15.171
Myles. Are you in there?

41:15.173 --> 41:16.573
Don't you have a key?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.477
Why would I need a key, huh?

41:21.746 --> 41:22.979
Is there a problem officers?

41:22.981 --> 41:26.583
No sir. We're just
responding to a call.

41:26.585 --> 41:29.319
Do you know Myles?

41:29.320 --> 41:32.054
I do. Quiet fella, but nice.
Always a hello in the hallway.

Raised right.

41:33.225 --> 41:35.225
Smells good too.

41:35.227 --> 41:37.227
What did he do?

41:37.228 --> 41:39.228
He didn't do anything. We're
just checking in on him.

41:39.231 --> 41:40.530
Did you happen to
see him last night?

41:40.532 --> 41:42.182
Nope.

41:42.183 --> 41:43.833
Don't think he came home or
I would have heard him.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.201
I hear everything.

41:45.203 --> 41:48.538
Even with this bad
ear, I catch it all.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.807
Let me know if you
need my help.

I think we've got it covered.
But, thank you for your help.

of the law.

Myles you here?

Myles?

42:24.809 --> 42:26.109
Myles?

42:32.117 --> 42:33.182
Wow.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.884
Who is his roommate, Mr. Clean?

42:37.756 --> 42:39.840
A carafe?

42:39.841 --> 42:41.925
Silver shaker? Who does he
entertain here? James Bond?

42:48.066 --> 42:51.568
When blockbuster runs out of
DVD's to rent, do they come here
and borrow a few from Myles?

42:51.570 --> 42:55.104
Ok. Enough with the running
commentary, can you just see if
you can find something please.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.139
Like what, dust?

42:56.141 --> 42:57.807
Good luck with that.

43:01.646 --> 43:02.845
Come on.

43:05.584 --> 43:07.150
He never came home last night.

43:07.152 --> 43:09.185
I'm sure he's fine.

43:09.186 --> 43:11.219
Yeah. Famous last words
before they find his
body in a dumpster.

43:11.222 --> 43:14.324
Look, we need to put an APB
out and get more eyes out
there looking for him now.

43:14.326 --> 43:18.261
Before we sound the alarm,
let's stop by his office
and see what we can find.

43:18.263 --> 43:19.762
Relax.

43:19.764 --> 43:20.797
It'll be fine.

43:20.799 --> 43:22.131
Just one quick stop, okay?

43:22.133 --> 43:23.333
Ok.

43:35.981 --> 43:37.146
There you are!

43:37.148 --> 43:38.498
Thanks for covering...

43:38.499 --> 43:39.849
Wait a second. Why do
you look like this?

43:39.851 --> 43:41.184
Is this a walk of shame?

43:41.186 --> 43:42.419
I'm not ashamed of anything.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.653
Well, you obviously
didn't do it right.

43:43.655 --> 43:45.655
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

43:45.657 --> 43:46.990
Ok.

43:46.992 --> 43:49.859
I want to hear everything,
and it better be filthy.

43:49.861 --> 43:51.828
Phone numbers,
names, descriptions.

43:51.830 --> 43:53.296
Is video asking too much?

43:53.298 --> 43:55.832
A gentleman never
kisses and tells.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.234
A gentleman who doesn't tell
is asking for a beating.

43:58.236 --> 44:00.637
Ok. But only because I'm
afraid of you right now.

44:00.639 --> 44:02.639
Wait, hold that thought.

44:02.641 --> 44:05.942
Before you start, I have
to call Brody and have him
call off the SWAT team

44:05.944 --> 44:08.044
he's going to
send after you.

44:09.347 --> 44:10.880
(PHONE RINGING)

44:10.882 --> 44:12.415
I was just calling you.

44:12.417 --> 44:14.317
See? I told you
he was fine.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.386
Has he been here
the whole time?

44:16.388 --> 44:19.022
He just got here. Hence
me trying to call you.

44:19.024 --> 44:21.391
Hey, I'm standing
right here.

44:21.393 --> 44:24.827
Diane called, said you
didn't come into work.
She made us all nervous.

44:24.829 --> 44:27.296
I just came in a little
late. You really didn't
have to call Brody.

44:27.298 --> 44:30.433
Don't blame me, it's my
maternal instincts -
I'm a slave to them.

44:32.437 --> 44:35.371
Suddenly this day has just
taken a turn for the better.

44:35.373 --> 44:38.775
Hello, my name is Diane.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.877
I hope you enjoy the
softer of the two sexes.

44:40.879 --> 44:44.313
Hi. I'm officer
Garcia...and I do.

44:46.885 --> 44:48.151
Where were you?

44:48.153 --> 44:49.352
I thought something happened.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.120
Something did.

44:51.122 --> 44:53.056
He was just about to tell
me all the sordid details.

44:53.058 --> 44:54.323
I'm dying to hear them.

44:54.325 --> 44:56.392
I have a feeling that
most of them are filthy.

44:56.394 --> 44:59.762
Well, I can't right
now. I've got a ton
of work to catch up on.

44:59.764 --> 45:01.264
So if you'd excuse me.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.967
Are you serious?
Is he serious?

45:04.969 --> 45:07.170
Look, could you
give us a minute?

45:07.172 --> 45:08.705
You take all the
time you need.

45:08.707 --> 45:10.740
You. Come with me.

45:13.445 --> 45:15.145
Ok. What were you doing?

45:15.146 --> 45:16.846
What were you thinking, going
to some strangers house

45:16.848 --> 45:17.847
in the middle of the
night for a hook up?

45:17.849 --> 45:19.916
It was your idea.

45:19.917 --> 45:21.984
I'm trying new things.
Plus, you do it all the time.

45:21.986 --> 45:23.419
I'm different than you.

45:23.421 --> 45:24.921
How?

45:24.923 --> 45:26.089
I'm a cop.

45:26.090 --> 45:27.256
I can defend myself,
unlike you...

45:27.258 --> 45:29.225
Oh please.

45:29.227 --> 45:30.226
Myles.

45:30.228 --> 45:32.512
I know guys,

45:32.513 --> 45:34.797
some of them are real creeps. I
see what people are capable of.

45:34.799 --> 45:35.998
I appreciate your concern.

45:36.000 --> 45:36.966
Really, I do.

45:36.968 --> 45:38.401
But I can take care of myself,

45:38.403 --> 45:40.069
thank you.

45:40.071 --> 45:42.672
Really?

45:42.673 --> 45:45.274
Like the time those girls
scouts talked you into buying
a dozen boxes of cookies?

45:45.276 --> 45:47.527
That wasn't my fault.

45:47.528 --> 45:49.779
There were four of them
and only one of me.

45:49.781 --> 45:52.215
So do you have a first
name, Officer Garcia?

45:52.217 --> 45:55.218
It's Richard.

45:55.220 --> 45:57.887
As in...?

45:57.889 --> 46:00.156
Yes, Richard.

46:00.158 --> 46:01.958
Uh huh.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.494
I can see that you're
packing a lot of equipment.

46:04.496 --> 46:09.265
Well, we're outfitted
with the proper gear to
handle any situation.

46:09.267 --> 46:11.033
I can see that.

46:12.337 --> 46:14.470
Look, I've got to get to work.

46:14.472 --> 46:15.905
Can we fight about this later?

46:15.907 --> 46:19.375
Maybe, if I'm
not too busy... dad.

46:21.346 --> 46:25.214
So what does a girl have
to do to get her hands
on your nightstick?

46:25.216 --> 46:26.482
Well, it's actually bigger
than it looks.

46:26.484 --> 46:27.517
If you...

46:28.419 --> 46:29.986
Let's go.

46:30.989 --> 46:31.954
It's nice meeting you.

46:31.956 --> 46:33.122
You too.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.359
(mouthing) Oh My God!

46:37.829 --> 46:39.262
So, what's the
deal with Diane?

46:39.264 --> 46:40.230
I know.

46:40.231 --> 46:41.197
I'm sorry you got
stuck with her.

46:41.199 --> 46:43.399
She is a psycho.

46:43.401 --> 46:47.203
I felt like a piece of meat for
her to chew on and spit out.

46:47.205 --> 46:48.938
How awesome is that?

46:48.940 --> 46:50.306
Wait.

46:50.308 --> 46:51.174
What?

46:51.176 --> 46:52.208
"Muy Caliente"

46:52.210 --> 46:53.109
Diane?

46:53.111 --> 46:55.011
As in, you and Diane?

46:55.013 --> 46:56.045
No, No, No.

46:56.047 --> 46:57.680
That is a bad idea.

46:57.681 --> 46:59.314
The two of you
could not be more...

46:59.317 --> 47:00.917
different.

47:00.918 --> 47:02.518
Friction is what makes
the heat, my friend.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.053
Besides, I'm packing...

47:04.055 --> 47:06.389
and I carry a gun.

47:06.391 --> 47:10.326
Let's leave the bad
sexual puns to me.

47:10.328 --> 47:13.963
So, what happened with Myles?

47:13.965 --> 47:17.366
He went home with
some guy last night.

47:17.368 --> 47:18.467
That's great.

47:18.469 --> 47:20.002
Your plan worked.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.003
Yeah.

47:21.005 --> 47:22.438
I guess it did, right?

47:22.440 --> 47:24.173
You should be happy;
you're off the hook.

47:24.175 --> 47:26.375
Beers on me. You
pick the place.

47:26.377 --> 47:27.610
Deal.

47:32.050 --> 47:33.950
*

47:33.952 --> 47:35.885
He clearly doesn't
know I carry a gun.

47:39.224 --> 47:42.091
Great. Now he's going to
like me that much more!

47:42.093 --> 47:44.160
I have gone to plenty of
titty bars with you.

47:44.162 --> 47:45.561
You can get your
gogo on with me.

47:45.563 --> 47:47.930
In that case, I need
another drink.

47:47.932 --> 47:51.200
Here, oh...

48:00.144 --> 48:01.878
Hey! What the hell?

48:04.616 --> 48:05.915
I'm sorry.

48:05.917 --> 48:08.985
You just caught
me off guard.

48:08.987 --> 48:11.454
I was going to warn
you about that.

48:11.456 --> 48:13.006
No you weren't.

48:13.007 --> 48:14.557
They're called mouth
shots for a reason.

48:14.559 --> 48:16.192
What the hell other kind
of shots are there?

48:16.194 --> 48:19.161
Don't answer that.

48:19.163 --> 48:20.563
Alright, I gotta run.

48:20.565 --> 48:23.349
Where are you going?

48:23.350 --> 48:26.134
I told Diane I'd meet up with
her after she got off work.

48:26.137 --> 48:27.970
Don't forget your handcuffs.

48:31.109 --> 48:34.977
*

48:34.979 --> 48:41.017
(PHONE BUZZING)

49:00.972 --> 49:06.275
Someone's having WWF Smackdown,
screaming until your neighbors
bang on the wall-style sex.

49:06.277 --> 49:08.110
It shows?

49:08.112 --> 49:10.713
I'm talking about myself
and my spicy Latino lover.

49:10.715 --> 49:12.615
You and Richard?

49:12.617 --> 49:15.418
It's kind of like a spin class-

49:15.419 --> 49:18.220
hot and sweaty, but with
handcuffs, a nightstick
and... pepper spray.

49:18.222 --> 49:21.290
Ok, pepper spray is too much.

49:21.292 --> 49:24.660
How are you and Hunter doing?

49:24.661 --> 49:28.029
Judging by the recent playlist
of eighties love songs, I'd
say it's going pretty well.

49:28.032 --> 49:31.000
Awww.

49:31.001 --> 49:33.969
You really are an Easy Bake
Oven away from being a twelve
year old girl, aren't you?

49:33.972 --> 49:35.671
Bye love.

49:47.752 --> 49:49.151
You ok partner?

49:49.153 --> 49:50.686
I took the new recruits
out last night,

49:50.688 --> 49:51.754
to O'Malley's.

49:51.756 --> 49:53.522
I don't know which is worse.

49:53.524 --> 49:55.658
The gay bars or the Irish ones.

49:55.660 --> 49:58.494
I guess it depends on
what you're looking for at the
end of the rainbow.

49:58.496 --> 50:01.297
At this point I would settle
for a well hung Leprechaun.

50:01.299 --> 50:03.299
That's why I'm glad
I'm dating again.

50:03.301 --> 50:04.633
I'm in bed by 10 pm.

50:04.635 --> 50:07.269
If I'm ever in bed by ten,

50:07.271 --> 50:09.005
put a bullet in me.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.740
I'm telling you, these past
two weeks have been great

50:10.742 --> 50:13.309
and the sex with
Diane is amazing.

50:13.311 --> 50:15.378
Which reminds me, I need
some more pepper spray.

50:15.380 --> 50:20.750
I'm not going to ask,
besides, the image of Diane
having sex is not something

50:20.752 --> 50:22.118
I want stuck in
my head all day.

50:22.120 --> 50:22.718
Really?

50:22.720 --> 50:25.154
Because I do.

50:25.156 --> 50:27.723
Speaking of which, it's
been two weeks for Myles
and his boyfriend.

50:27.725 --> 50:31.127
I know because I'm
patiently waiting for him
to get dumped again.

50:31.129 --> 50:34.163
That's the kind of
postive, healthy support
a best friend deserves.

50:34.165 --> 50:39.168
Hey, I'm just waiting in the
wings like I always do for when
he gets his heart broken again.

50:39.170 --> 50:40.036
Face it.

50:40.038 --> 50:41.670
You miss him.

50:41.672 --> 50:44.407
You don't know what
you're talking about.

50:44.409 --> 50:46.375
If you say so,
but I do know this:

50:46.377 --> 50:48.444
if he were my friend
and I missed him,

50:48.446 --> 50:49.712
I'd grab a couple of beers,

50:49.714 --> 50:51.247
get some Chinese food

50:51.249 --> 50:53.149
and go over to his
place after work.

50:53.151 --> 50:57.720
Well, you're not me and I
don't need your advice.

51:03.461 --> 51:05.094
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

51:05.096 --> 51:07.563
Come in.

51:07.565 --> 51:08.597
Oh hey.

51:08.599 --> 51:10.833
Brody.

51:10.834 --> 51:13.068
I thought it would be nice if
I surprised you with dinner.

51:13.071 --> 51:15.237
That's actually a
really nice surprise,

51:15.239 --> 51:18.924
but I already have plans.

51:18.925 --> 51:22.610
I can see you have plans.
Are you having Liberace over
for dinner? What is this?

51:22.613 --> 51:25.681
It's Hunter's first time
coming over tonight.

51:25.683 --> 51:29.351
I wanted to do
something special.

51:29.353 --> 51:33.122
Well, we can do
something another night.

51:33.124 --> 51:35.524
You know you don't have to go.

51:35.526 --> 51:37.193
You could join us if you want.

51:37.195 --> 51:38.795
Don't be ridiculous.

51:38.796 --> 51:40.396
You know I don't do threesomes.

51:40.398 --> 51:41.764
Since when?

51:45.837 --> 51:47.436
It's too much, isn't it.

51:47.438 --> 51:49.538
What?

51:49.539 --> 51:51.639
No it's ridiculous
and over-the-top,

51:51.642 --> 51:55.244
but it's you and that's what
I think is so nice about it.

51:55.246 --> 52:01.250
Other guys may find it
terrifying, but I
think it's wonderful.

52:01.252 --> 52:02.585
You like that about me?

52:02.587 --> 52:04.220
What that you're a psycho?

52:04.222 --> 52:07.623
Yes, it makes me
feel more normal.

52:10.261 --> 52:14.330
Look finish getting ready and
we'll do something tomorrow.

52:14.332 --> 52:17.333
Happy hour?

52:17.335 --> 52:18.400
See you tomorrow.

52:18.402 --> 52:19.802

52:56.407 --> 52:58.374
I'll see you in five minutes.

53:27.772 --> 53:28.904
Hey Brody.

53:28.906 --> 53:30.673
Stone.

53:30.675 --> 53:32.541
Come on in, have a drink.

53:32.543 --> 53:34.243
I can see you've
done this before.

53:34.245 --> 53:36.445
Maybe once or twice.

53:36.447 --> 53:38.847
So, how do you want to do this?

53:38.849 --> 53:39.848
Quickly.

53:39.850 --> 53:41.517
I have dinner in an hour.

53:41.519 --> 53:43.452
I'm fine with
being an appetizer.

53:45.289 --> 53:48.357
Just so you know, you're
going to be late for dessert.

53:51.696 --> 53:57.700

It's probably my date tonight.
He's obsessive compulsive.

54:06.611 --> 54:07.643
How annoying.

54:07.645 --> 54:08.744
I know, right?

54:12.717 --> 54:15.417
I'm sorry, I can't.
Just get it.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.553
I'll send it to voicemail.

54:20.958 --> 54:24.994
Oh!! Please tell me your
name is not Hunter.

54:24.996 --> 54:28.330
No, of course it's not.

54:28.332 --> 54:29.898
Thank god.

54:29.900 --> 54:31.333
Hunter's my hook-up name,

54:31.335 --> 54:32.668
like "Stone".

54:32.670 --> 54:34.470
Oh, Fuck me!

54:34.472 --> 54:36.305
Sure, if you want
me to be on top.

54:37.541 --> 54:40.442
No. As in God-damn it.

54:40.444 --> 54:41.877
What's the problem?

54:41.879 --> 54:45.314
Oh Man, I really wanted you to
turn out to be a good guy.

54:45.316 --> 54:47.049
I am a good guy.

54:48.319 --> 54:50.719
Well, maybe not marriage
material, but...

54:50.721 --> 54:53.022
I gotta go.

54:55.293 --> 54:56.792
Dude, chill out!

54:56.794 --> 54:58.494
This is not a big deal.

54:58.496 --> 55:00.746
Actually it is.

55:00.747 --> 55:02.997
Myles is my best friend and
he's going to freak out

55:03.000 --> 55:05.601
when he finds out that I
hooked up with his boyfriend.

55:05.603 --> 55:06.635
Boyfriend?

55:06.637 --> 55:08.504
We're not boyfriends.

55:08.506 --> 55:10.339
Myles is a nice guy
and a decent lay,

55:10.341 --> 55:12.474
but that's about where it ends.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.543
Don't make me knock you out.

55:14.545 --> 55:16.578
Hey, you're in my
house, remember?

55:16.580 --> 55:17.513
Ok, look.

55:17.515 --> 55:18.681
This is how this is going to go.

55:18.683 --> 55:21.016
You go have dinner
with Myles and

55:21.018 --> 55:22.651
you don't say anything
about this.

55:22.653 --> 55:24.853
This never happened.

55:24.855 --> 55:26.455
You know what, I really
think you should leave.

55:26.457 --> 55:27.823
I'm serious, now!

55:27.825 --> 55:29.809
I'm not done here.

55:29.810 --> 55:31.794
Yeah you are, and if you don't
leave I'll call the cops.

55:31.796 --> 55:34.430
I'm a cop.

55:34.432 --> 55:36.477
Yeah.

55:36.478 --> 55:38.523
Well if that's the case,

55:38.524 --> 55:40.569
then I'll just call Myles and
tell him I hooked up with his
best friend...the cop.

55:40.571 --> 55:43.439
Ok, calm down.

55:43.441 --> 55:45.107
I'll go, but I need
you to promise

55:45.109 --> 55:47.543
that you're not going to be
an asshole to Myles, ok?

55:47.545 --> 55:53.015
Just go have dinner with him,
don't say anything about this.
I am asking you nicely.

55:53.017 --> 55:54.383
See?

55:54.385 --> 55:55.818
Now you're being a good boy.

55:55.820 --> 55:57.786
Just so you know,
I'll do what I want.

55:57.788 --> 55:58.987
And I'll start with
throwing you out.

55:58.989 --> 56:00.823
Got it?

56:00.825 --> 56:01.890
I got it.

56:01.892 --> 56:03.475
Good.

56:03.476 --> 56:05.059
I'm glad we're on
the same page again.

56:05.062 --> 56:06.428
Now leave!

Hey Myles.

57:17.701 --> 57:21.637
Hunter broke up with me.

57:21.639 --> 57:22.604
Awe.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.006
I'm so sorry, Myles.

Death by chocolate?

57:33.951 --> 57:38.787
Death by homemade tiramisu.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.122
I'll be right there.

57:46.864 --> 57:48.797
One day, you are
going to find a guy

57:48.799 --> 57:51.233
who see's what a
great catch you are.

57:51.235 --> 57:54.002
You are going to make
someone the best husband.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.973
What about you?

57:57.975 --> 58:00.108
I am not a catch.

58:00.110 --> 58:01.076
Well that's not true.

58:01.078 --> 58:02.811
Yes, it is.

58:02.813 --> 58:06.081
Look, I'm not like you.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.250
Anybody who would pass up an

58:08.252 --> 58:10.919
amazing evening like this,

58:10.921 --> 58:16.658
with you, is a fool.

58:16.660 --> 58:19.595
Well, I'm obviously
doing something wrong.

58:19.597 --> 58:21.196
You have lousy taste in men.

58:21.198 --> 58:23.549
Take Hunter...

58:23.550 --> 58:25.901
- Let's not talk about him.
- I think we should...
- I really don't want to.

58:25.903 --> 58:27.503
Let me finish.

58:33.143 --> 58:37.646
Anybody who would break up
with you in a text is a creep
and not worth your time.

58:37.648 --> 58:41.950
You think I don't know that?
I didn't even text him back.

58:41.952 --> 58:46.288
I'm sick of being
mistreated by asshole guys
who don't appreciate me.

58:46.290 --> 58:49.658
Good for you Myles.

58:49.660 --> 58:53.996
Now, can we just move on?

58:53.998 --> 58:56.131
Let's just enjoy the fact that
we're hanging out together.

58:56.133 --> 58:58.567
Yes.

58:58.568 --> 59:01.002
Let's make tonight about this
amazing tiramisu that you made.

59:01.005 --> 59:03.071
- And us.
- And us.

59:12.917 --> 59:18.854
So, run this by me one more
time. Why didn't you tell him
what happened the other night?

59:18.856 --> 59:21.557
I just couldn't.

59:21.558 --> 59:24.259
If you knew Myles and how upset
it would make him, trust me, you
wouldn't have told him either.

59:24.261 --> 59:26.862
Actually, yes, I would have.

59:26.864 --> 59:29.064
Myles can't handle
these things.

59:29.066 --> 59:31.567
He's a grown man.

59:31.568 --> 59:34.069
Yeah, on the outside maybe but
on the inside he's all...

59:34.071 --> 59:35.771
Hello Kitty.

59:35.773 --> 59:37.172
He's never going to find out.

59:37.174 --> 59:39.691
That's not how it works.

59:39.692 --> 59:42.209
Trust me, they always find
out. And even if they don't,

59:42.212 --> 59:44.535
you'll always think in
the back of your head

59:44.536 --> 59:46.859
that they know something, but
just aren't saying anything.

59:46.860 --> 59:49.183
Does someone have a little
baggage from a past relationship
they want to talk about?

59:49.186 --> 59:50.986
Let's just say, I had
to learn the hard way.

59:50.988 --> 59:55.057
Fine, I'll talk
to him tonight.

59:57.061 --> 59:58.293
-Ok?
- Alright.

59:59.063 --> 01:00:05.133

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.671
How you doing?

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:12.207
I liked him,
he was a great guy.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.176
He wasn't that great.

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:17.429
Hi Brody... Martini?

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:20.681
No thanks, I'm
probably just going to
get it thrown in my face.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.352
What did you do?

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:26.021
Can I just start off by saying
that it was not my fault.

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:29.858
That is the worst way
to start a conversation.
That's like saying,

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.660
"I know this looks bad", or,

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.695
"This is just going to
hurt a little bit."

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:36.932
I can tell already,
this is not going to end well.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:38.968
I've known you
for over ten years.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.003
Nothing you say is
going to bother me
or surprise me anymore.

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:43.038
So just tell me.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.775
I ran Hunter's ID
down at the station.

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:50.312
His real name is Steven
Adams. He's from Nebraska.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.981
Well, I know where he's
from. I didn't know his
name wasn't Hunter.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.951
Yeah and it's
not Stone either.
That's my point.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:57.686
What's the point?
And who is Stone?

01:00:57.688 --> 01:01:00.389
Exactly! Neither of
us knew his real name.

01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:02.157
Just tell me what happened.

01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:06.228
After I left your place
the other night,

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:10.298
I went on Grindr
to meet someone.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:14.970
-You hooked up with Hunter?
-I didn't know it was him!

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:17.906
He said his name was
Stone. I mean, who uses
that name anyway.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:19.908
He texted me on Grindr,
I went over there.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.845
I did not know what I
was doing was wrong. I
would never do that to you.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.580
You suck.

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:27.314
How was I supposed to
know? It's not like you
introduced me to the guy.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:29.568
You're the one that
ruined this for me.

01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:31.820
I met a great guy and you just
couldn't stand it, could you?

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:34.122
He is not a great guy,
believe me.

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:36.191
Certainly not the Prince
Charming you think he is.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.859
Trust me, Hunter is a creep.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.795
Trust you?

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:45.801
Think about it Myles. It's
always the same with you.
You bring this on yourself.

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:50.338
You keep thinking that one
guy is going to be exactly
what you need to be happy.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:53.408
It is not the case,
never will be.

01:01:56.747 --> 01:02:00.015
Well, sadly that's
true isn't it?

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:02.050
You're right, things
have got to change.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.386
I gotta to go, sorry
I can't do this anymore.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:08.023
-Wait, what?
-One martini. Dirty.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:12.894
Myles.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.463
Myles.

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:29.411
Look at this guy.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:32.214
He didn't even attempt to
slow down when he saw us.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:34.350
So light him up!

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.485
-He was only going forty.
-He's speeding right
in front of us.

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:38.854
People need to learn to respect
authority. Light him up!

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:42.290
-It's not a big deal.
-I said, let's get them!

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.493
So now you're that asshole
cop who chases down

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:47.262
an '87 Corolla for going fifteen
miles over the speed limit?

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:51.633
Yes.

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:52.933
You really need to straighten
this thing out with Myles.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.303
I've tried calling,
texting, emailing him.

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:58.273
He obviously doesn't
want to talk to me.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.809
I may not be the
smartest guy in the world
but I can take a hint...

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.377
...when someone doesn't
want to see me.

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.944
You have to go over
there and work this out.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.947
Knock his door down
if you have to.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:09.451
-He doesn't want to talk to me.
-You're a cop for Christ's sake.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.154
Pull your balls out
of your ass and man up.

01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:15.090
You miss him. Make it right.

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:17.993
Fine.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:29.304
Myles, open up.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.438
Myles, come on, open up.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.175
I need you to open
up, just talk to me.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:36.244
Knock one more time
and I'm calling the cops.

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:43.885
Officer.

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:46.555
Under-cover, huh?
A sting operation.

01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:48.056
I get it.

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:49.591
Still after Myles?

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:50.559
Have you seen him?

01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:53.361
Nope. What did he do?

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:55.130
He didn't do anything.

01:03:55.132 --> 01:04:00.068
It's always the quiet ones.
I knew he was a bad seed.

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.537
That isn't the case, sir.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:04.506
Of course you
can't say anything.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.275
I know what's going on.

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:10.345
I just hope you get
the son-of-a bitch!

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:21.623
Myles.

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:23.558
Come on.

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:26.995
Myles.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:31.600
*

01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:33.635
Pizza, wings and beer.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:35.403
Who needs men?

01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:41.376
We'll have more
fun without them.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:45.347
-No we won't.
-You're right.

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:47.515
I'll try not to bitch about
how much men suck tonight.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:51.052
Why? It's my favorite subject.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.255
Luckily for you I have
the perfect evening planned.

01:04:53.257 --> 01:04:58.226
Comfort food, ice cream and...

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.161
a romantic movie.

01:05:00.163 --> 01:05:02.097
I love that we are doing this.

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:04.466
-I do it every day.
-What about Richard?

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.601
Are you kidding?
It's his favorite thing.

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:10.605
Two bowls of pistachio
froyo, twin snuggies
and a romantic movie.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:12.607
We cry all night long.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:15.677
-Lucky bitch.
-I know.

01:05:18.181 --> 01:05:22.217
Diane, I need to
tell you something.
Please don't be upset.

01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:27.022
Any conversation
that begins with, "please
don't be upset", upsets me.

01:05:27.024 --> 01:05:31.526
I need to start fresh. Get
somewhere far away from here.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:33.328
You're moving to the Valley?

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:36.364
No, I'm thinking of transferring
to the New York office.

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:40.669
There's a job opening
there for a senior litigator
that starts next week.

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:42.437
I know you're not
going to agree with this...

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:47.042
You want to leave
and move to New York?

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:49.311
We both know I should go.

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:52.280
Actually, we don't. I
think you're running
away from your problems.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.382
Please don't make
this any harder for
me than it already is.

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:55.617
I really need to do this.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:58.804
No you don't!

01:05:58.805 --> 01:06:01.990
It's an irrational,
impetuous and totally
emotionally clouded decision.

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:06.061
I need to break this cycle and
I can't do it from Los Angeles.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:12.467
Fine. I'll concede.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:17.305
-But only under one condition.
-Let the negotiations begin.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.975
You have to let me
have a going away
party for you this weekend.

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:21.476
Absolutely not. No party.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.345
Just a few friends over
for drinks at my place?

01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:26.414
-No more than six.
-Deal.

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:36.658
So how are you going to tell
Brody that you're moving to
the other side of the country?

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:44.532
I don't know yet.

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.470
I could have Richard do it.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.612
Brody.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.186
And to think he's a cop.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:19.067
(TELEVISION SOUNDS)

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:30.478
If you were a horse,
I'd be obliged to put you down.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.783
What time is it? Am I late?

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:36.684
Let's just say you're
early for lunch.

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:38.753
Why don't you get in the shower?

01:07:40.157 --> 01:07:43.091
So, how long is this
going to go on?

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:46.528
Just give me five minutes
to take a shower, ok?

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:48.496
Not the shower.
The self-pity and depression.

01:07:48.498 --> 01:07:50.765
It's been every night this week.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:53.301
Hey, I've finally found
something I'm good at.

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:56.571
Why quit when I've
almost mastered it?

01:07:56.573 --> 01:08:00.141
Well, since you're already down,
I've got something else for you.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:02.377
It's an invitation.

01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:03.778
From who?

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.213
Diane.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:09.551
She's having a few people over.

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:11.252
Is Myles going to be there?

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:14.222
Yep.

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.191
This is the perfect
opportunity for me to
smooth things out with Myles.

01:08:17.194 --> 01:08:20.694
In theory.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:22.564
Was this Diane's idea?

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:26.734
Absolutely. So you'll come?

01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:30.505
Hell yeah. Now I got
something to look forward to.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:36.644
Me too.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:46.354
*

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:48.490
I kept it small
like you wanted.

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:50.358
I asked you not to do anything.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:53.127
This was my compromise.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.714
I'll miss you.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:58.299
I'm well aware. I still can't
believe you're doing this.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:01.736
Five days on the open
road will do me good.

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:03.721
Wait until you hit Nevada.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.707
You're going to regret
that decision all the way
to the Statue of Liberty.

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:07.091
Brody's here.

01:09:07.093 --> 01:09:08.475
I'll be in the bomb shelter
if anyone's needs me.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.362
Oh no, you're not
going anywhere.

01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:12.247
We need someone who
can operate a handgun.

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:14.215
Hey!

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.618
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.171
It's good to see you.

01:09:19.171 --> 01:09:21.723
So, what's the occasion?
You got a promotion, right?

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.328
Richard, will you help me dear?

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.430
Oh, and bring a shovel.

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:33.984
Would you excuse us?

01:09:33.986 --> 01:09:37.537
He's going to be really
busy digging a six by
three foot hole out back.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:39.908
What was that about?

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:42.877
It's just that this
isn't exactly a party
for my promotion.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:45.380
So, you didn't get a promotion?

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.916
I technically did,
I guess you could say that.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.350
Well, congrats!

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:53.287
It's also a going away party.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.856
For who?

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:02.330
Oh, you're leaving.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.434
Where?  When?

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:10.371
I head out on Saturday morning.

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:13.408
Drive across country
to New York.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:18.513
Saturday to New York
and this is how you tell me?

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:23.418
-Well Richard was
going to tell you.
-You asked Richard to tell me?

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.486
Diane did.

01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:32.627
How could you leave
and not say anything to me?

01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:33.795
I haven't left yet.

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:37.498
Yeah, but you're
planning on it Myles.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.651
Why?

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.803
Because I don't have
a reason to stay anymore.

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:46.274
I'm not a good enough reason?

01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:48.643
You tell me, Brody.

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:50.745
If this is about
the Hunter thing,

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.846
I told you I did not
mean to mess it up for you.

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:55.416
I was just trying
to protect you.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.719
I know that and I'm not
mad about it anymore.

01:10:57.721 --> 01:11:01.006
I'm the reason I need to leave.

01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:04.292
I need to grow up and
stop looking for my Prince
Charming to come and save me.

01:11:04.294 --> 01:11:06.861
That is what I've been
telling you the whole time.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:08.930
Well then, I agree with you.

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:17.672
So you think that going to
New York is what's going
to make you happy.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:20.008
It's a start.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:25.446
Well then, I guess that's that.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.515
I guess so.

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:50.805
*

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:56.577
(PHONE BEEPS)

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:36.851
-Can I get you another?
-No. I'm good, thanks.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:50.498
I'm mad at you.

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:54.401
I know, but being
that I'm your only friend
now and your partner at work,

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:57.138
I think you're going to have
to get over it pretty quickly.

01:12:59.642 --> 01:13:03.511
You knew that was
a going away party.

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:08.549
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but I figured you deserved
to hear it directly from Myles.

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.786
Plus, if I had told you,
you wouldn't have come
to say goodbye.

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:13.688
You don't know me.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:15.757
It's like we never even met.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:18.626
You know, he's right?

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:22.530
It is better for both
of us if he just leaves.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:24.932
Well, you certainly
know what's best.

01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:27.835
I'm not like Myles,
I don't need anyone.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:31.939
It's true. You're not miserable
at all when he's gone.

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:33.875
Myles is a hopeless romantic.

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:36.577
All he wants is
someone to love him.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:39.614
Yeah, so unreasonable.

01:13:39.616 --> 01:13:43.651
Plus, he's a people
pleaser. All he cares
about is the guy he's with.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:45.920
That's horrible. I can see
why guys would hate that.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:51.659
Myles is like a penguin.
He will bond to you, he's
dependable and trustworthy.

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:54.962
I'm really starting
to hate that guy.

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:58.433
I mean, could you imagine
if Myles and I were together.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:03.037
Not at all. It's crazy
to think that two people
who care about each other

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:08.910
as much as you two do
would ever, ever want
to be in a relationship.

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:12.980
I know, right? I mean,
if Myles were the
perfect guy for me,

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:15.450
I would have realized
that years ago.

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:18.336
Absolutely.

01:14:18.337 --> 01:14:21.221
I mean there is no way
you'd overlook something
so obvious for so long.

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:23.791
Exactly.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.093
Myles just wants to be married.

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:32.166
And all I want is for
him to be happy.

01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:39.507
Then I guess the only
way for that to happen
is to remove you from his life.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:45.780
Yeah, I guess.

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:57.625
*

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:57.585
To Brody.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.856
I hope you find
someone to love you.

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:04.926
I hope you find
someone to love.

01:16:22.612 --> 01:16:27.048
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here
today to bear witness

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:30.117
to the matrimony
of these two men.

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:37.925
This is a relationship that
stands for love and loyalty.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:42.597
This is a relationship that
stands for honesty and trust.

01:16:42.599 --> 01:16:48.669
But most importantly,
this is a relationship
that stands for friendship.

01:16:48.671 --> 01:16:54.909
Because before they were
lovers, they were friends,

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:59.947
and it is this seed of
friendship that love
was their destiny.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:04.118
One cannot dictate or
determine the course of love.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:10.191
For if love finds you worthy,
then love directs you.

01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:18.933
It is this sacred
and holy estate which
you enter into as one.

01:17:18.935 --> 01:17:25.072
And if there is anyone who
has just cause why these
two should not join as one,

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:30.144
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:51.198
Do you take this man to love,
honor and comfort,

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.035
and keep in sickness
and in health,

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:56.804
in sadness and in joy,

01:17:56.806 --> 01:18:01.375
and cherish and bestow upon
him your deepest devotion,

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:04.445
for as long as you
both shall live?

01:18:04.447 --> 01:18:06.213
I do.

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:14.088
Then, by the power
vested in me,

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.424
I now pronounce you

01:18:16.426 --> 01:18:20.394
husband and husband.

01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:23.998
You may now kiss your groom.

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:43.017
*

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:14.448
Come on! Are you kidding me?

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:25.526
Oh... I can't.

01:19:25.528 --> 01:19:28.796
Come on, Come on, Come on!

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.341
Myles, are you in there?

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:16.811
Myles, are you in there?

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:18.245
Myles!

01:20:18.247 --> 01:20:20.981
-Myles!
-What are you
god-damned kids up to now?

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:24.485
-I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
-I'm sorry officer, I
didn't realize it was you.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:26.520
Still haven't caught him yet?

01:20:26.522 --> 01:20:28.522
Have you seen him today?

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:30.523
Saw him this morning. He
woke me up making a ruckus.

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:33.260
I went back to sleep.
Which I never do by the way.

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:36.063
Damn Sciatica kept
me up all night.

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:38.566
I got one of these
dial mattresses.

01:20:38.568 --> 01:20:42.203
I changed it from a four to a
six, I thought that might help.

01:20:42.205 --> 01:20:44.305
I slept better on my old Sealy.

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:47.909
You think they'd let me
take this one back?

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:51.512
-It's only been six weeks.
-I really have to get to Myles,
so if you know where he is.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:55.149
Gone now. I guess
you missed him.

01:20:55.151 --> 01:20:57.218
Yeah. I guess I did.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:00.020
You're gonna go
after him, aren't you?

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:02.623
He's not a criminal.

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:08.896
I know that. I'm not blind and
stupid. You obviously love him.

01:21:08.898 --> 01:21:11.866
I do.

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:15.002
Then go after him!

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:20.441
Don't make the same mistake
I did and end up like me.
Trust me.

01:21:20.443 --> 01:21:23.143
Don't just stand
there, go get him!

01:21:23.145 --> 01:21:25.179
He's going to New York.

01:21:25.181 --> 01:21:27.581
I don't know where he is. I'm
not going to catch up to him.

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:31.886
You've got a cop car don't
you? Light up that son-of-a
bitch. I've seen them go

01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:38.292
two-hundred miles an hour.
Tear ass down that freeway!
Don't let him get away.

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:42.363
Ok. Ok.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:46.567
Crazy kids.

(POLICE SIREN)

01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.446
I'm sorry for getting you out
of bed so early for this.

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:02.216
Who needs sleep on
a Saturday morning?

01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:04.318
Besides, this is fun.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.253
It's just like those movies
Diane makes me watch.

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:08.289
I have to catch up to Myles
before it's too late.

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:10.224
Do me a favor, call him
and see where he is.

01:22:10.226 --> 01:22:13.260
No way! That is not
how's its done.

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:15.062
Myles is a romantic.

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:16.614
We have to catch up with him.

01:22:16.615 --> 01:22:18.165
It's the element of surprise
that will win him back.

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:19.967
Yeah, and what if we don't
make it there in time?

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:22.136
Trust me on this one.
I know how it's done.

01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:24.538
You always get the
guy in the end.

01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:32.346
Calling doesn't seem like such
a bad idea now, does it?

01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:34.949
It always works in the movies.

01:22:38.154 --> 01:22:40.354
So what now?

01:22:40.356 --> 01:22:42.256
I don't know.

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:45.192
It usually doesn't
turn out this way.

01:22:46.662 --> 01:22:49.263
I'm too late, aren't I?

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.435
Might as well head back.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:58.439
I know you have
plans with Diane.

01:22:58.441 --> 01:23:00.240
Let me call her and let her
know I'll be a little late.

01:23:00.242 --> 01:23:02.176
I'll be in the car.

This better not be an, "I
can't make it today" call.

01:23:17.593 --> 01:23:19.526
No, no, I'll be there.

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:22.463
Small emergency.
I'll just be a little late.

01:23:22.465 --> 01:23:25.232
Well hurry, so you can
start making it up to me.

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:27.234
And don't forget your uniform -

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:29.069
especially the night stick.

01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:30.137
Bye.

be a little bit late.

01:23:41.117 --> 01:23:43.384
Keep me company for
just a bit more?

01:23:43.386 --> 01:23:46.587
I've got three thousand miles
ahead of me and now all I'm
going to be able to think about

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:48.389
is you and Richard playing
"cops and robbers".

01:23:48.391 --> 01:23:51.158
You should see me
trying to resist arrest.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.626
I really need to go.

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:55.396
I just wanted to help you
clean up and say goodbye.

01:23:55.398 --> 01:23:57.765
Let's have a
mimosa for the road.

01:23:57.767 --> 01:24:01.668
No one should drive into the
middle of this country without
at least one drink in them.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:04.738
-You're awful.
-I know.

01:24:16.052 --> 01:24:18.685
Are you sure you don't
want to join us for brunch?

01:24:18.687 --> 01:24:22.056
You know a gay guy is tired
when he turns down brunch.

01:24:22.058 --> 01:24:25.826
I had a bad night
and a crappy morning.

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:27.812
Bottomless drinks.

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:29.797
I have a feeling you'll get
your money's worth today.

I really don't feel like
being around people.

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:36.270
Especially those in love.

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:40.274
Where the hell have
you two been?

01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:42.276
And you brought the squad car.

01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:44.344
Nice touch.

01:24:46.282 --> 01:24:48.482

this morning.

up with Myles.

01:24:49.652 --> 01:24:51.318

Why are you trying
to catch up with Myles?

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:55.521
Brody wants to talk to him.
He doesn't want him to leave.

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:56.857
Well, you just missed him.

01:24:56.859 --> 01:24:59.226
Obviously.

skills. I mean he was just
here, he left a minute ago.

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:05.265
Hey, we can still catch him!

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:08.669
You can't call him.
That's not the way it works.

01:25:08.671 --> 01:25:11.738

trying to tell him that.

Why are you all
doing this to me?

01:26:16.939 --> 01:26:20.207
There's nothing you can
do to make me stay.

01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:31.351
Was that supposed
to change my mind?

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:32.452
That was the idea.

01:26:32.454 --> 01:26:34.788
It didn't.

with you anymore.

01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:45.499
I've got to do what's
right for me now, and
that's getting away from you.

You may not need someone,
but you deserve someone.

01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:50.938
And I want to be that person.

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:39.953
Fine, I'll do it pro-bono.

01:27:39.955 --> 01:27:41.888
Let me see it.

01:27:44.727 --> 01:27:46.560
I'm sorry, it's not
legally binding.

01:27:46.562 --> 01:27:49.930
It states that this becomes
effective on Myles' birthday.

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:53.533
Unfortunately, that's
not until tomorrow.

01:27:54.036 --> 01:27:56.737
I guess we'll just have
to wait twelve hours.

01:27:56.739 --> 01:27:59.973
We can put him under
house arrest until
the contract is due.

01:27:59.975 --> 01:28:02.376
I can leave this
perp in your custody.

01:28:02.378 --> 01:28:04.444
The law is the law.

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:11.785
I'm so glad that everybody's
made the decision about
what I should do.

01:28:15.557 --> 01:28:17.658
Does anybody want to
know what I think?

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.795
Yes, of course.

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:24.865
I think after
waiting ten years,

01:28:24.867 --> 01:28:27.934
I deserve a proper kiss.

01:28:29.038 --> 01:28:35.309

01:28:49.458 --> 01:28:52.526
(FACETIME RINGING)

01:28:55.597 --> 01:28:57.464
You're calling me why?

01:28:57.466 --> 01:29:00.701
Well, I always call you after
I hook up with a hot guy.

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:02.436
How was it?

01:29:02.438 --> 01:29:05.605
Let me put it like this: I'm
gonna have to call you back,

01:29:05.607 --> 01:29:07.741
cause I'm about to do it again.

01:29:07.743 --> 01:29:09.943
It was that good?

01:29:09.945 --> 01:29:11.511
Oh yeah.

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:13.547
And by the way,

01:29:13.549 --> 01:29:15.449
Happy Birthday Myles.

01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:17.851
It certainly is.

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:23.890
