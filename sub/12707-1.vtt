WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:07.355
Mmm.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.088
[snarling]

00:55.228 --> 00:57.143
-[Buffy grunts]
-[yells]

01:26.825 --> 01:28.566
[theme music playing]

02:18.399 --> 02:20.662
Ha! Touchdown!
Oh, yeah.

02:20.704 --> 02:22.185
Go, Team Me!

02:27.146 --> 02:29.497
Anybody ever told "Team You"
the quarterback throws
like a girl?

02:30.846 --> 02:32.108
I do?

02:36.807 --> 02:39.158
-Ohh! Uh.
-Oh, sorry.

02:40.638 --> 02:43.554
No! No, don't you--
No, no, no!

02:43.598 --> 02:44.902
[Riley grunts]

02:44.947 --> 02:47.210
I'm exhausted just
looking at those two.

02:47.253 --> 02:49.299
All the splashing and
jumping and running--

02:49.343 --> 02:52.346
Shouldn't relaxing
involve less exertion?

02:52.389 --> 02:56.305
Absolutely.
Exertion can lead
to sweatiness.

02:56.349 --> 02:59.048
Which can cause the pain and
heartbreak of stinkiness.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.354
Better to just stay put.

03:01.397 --> 03:03.051
I think we've just
put our finger on

03:03.094 --> 03:04.444
why we're the sidekicks.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.669
-Game over?
-Uh, Buffy slayed the football.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.370
- Where's my burger?
- Yeah, man, I'm starving.

03:16.413 --> 03:19.024
-Cow me.
-XANDER: The fire's
not cooperating.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.373
It's comforting to know

03:20.417 --> 03:23.289
that I lack the culinary
finesse of a caveman.

03:23.332 --> 03:25.292
Ignis incende!

03:27.685 --> 03:30.861
Willow, check you out.
Witch-fu.

03:30.906 --> 03:34.343
It's no big.
You just have to balance
the elements,

03:34.388 --> 03:36.477
so when you affect one,
you don't wind up causing--

03:36.520 --> 03:40.045
-[thunder crashing]
-[all screaming]

03:40.088 --> 03:41.917
I didn't do it!
I didn't do it!

03:43.439 --> 03:45.442
-[thunder continues]
-[Willow screaming]

04:04.679 --> 04:08.204
Come on. Hurry it up.
I'm gettin' soaked.I'm tryin'.

04:08.247 --> 04:11.163
Geez,
this thing weighs--

04:12.207 --> 04:15.384
Nice. Good job.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.952
Look at this. Guy's
cartin' dirt around.

04:17.995 --> 04:20.389
Leave it. We'll--
we'll turn it on its side.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.000
Dirt? Man,
rich people are--

04:23.045 --> 04:26.353
[gasps, gags]

04:29.834 --> 04:31.793
[typing]

04:31.836 --> 04:34.447
There you go.
All set.

04:34.490 --> 04:38.668
Thank you, Willow. Obstinate
bloody machine simply refused
to work for me.

04:38.713 --> 04:41.411
Just call me
the computer whisperer.

04:41.454 --> 04:43.673
Let's get scannin'.
I want to see this puppy go.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.372
Start with those.

04:45.415 --> 04:48.591
Start?
Where is finish?

04:48.636 --> 04:51.028
Willow, it's essential
that we begin to archive
the library.

04:51.072 --> 04:53.944
I mean, most of these texts
have no duplicates.

04:53.988 --> 04:55.685
But... now?

04:55.730 --> 05:00.343
Doesn't winter seem more
like archiving season?

05:00.387 --> 05:03.607
Well, you don't have to, Willow.
I mean, you're welcome
to leave if, uh--

05:05.261 --> 05:08.132
No. It's fine.

05:08.177 --> 05:11.440
It's just, you've been
Mr. Project all summer.

05:11.485 --> 05:16.011
You know?
Labeling the amulets and
indexing your diaries.

05:16.053 --> 05:18.404
I draw the line
at making giant
rubber-band balls.

05:18.447 --> 05:20.362
That's when you'll
just have to get a life.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.411
[clears throat]
That's what I'm
trying to do, actually,

05:24.454 --> 05:27.021
is, um, get a life.

05:27.064 --> 05:29.067
It might go better
if you left the house.

05:29.110 --> 05:31.418
Willow, um,

05:31.461 --> 05:35.204
you mustn't repeat
what I'm about to say,
especially not to Buffy.

05:36.247 --> 05:38.033
Uh-oh.

05:38.076 --> 05:40.427
-You promise?
-Oh, god.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.951
Well, I guess.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.475
Now that I know
there's something to know,
I can't not know

05:45.519 --> 05:48.435
just because I'm afraid
somebody will know
I know. You know?

05:48.478 --> 05:52.264
-Did that mean yes?
-Yeah.

05:52.307 --> 05:54.528
We're doing all this
because I want you
and the others

05:54.571 --> 05:57.792
to have everything you need
at your fingertips.

05:57.834 --> 06:00.055
You see, I'm--
I'm going back to England.

06:02.492 --> 06:05.451
You're... What?
But you can't.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.454
You're...
Buffy's Watcher.

06:08.584 --> 06:10.891
I mean,
in a fired way, but--

06:10.935 --> 06:14.242
Well, it's becoming
quite obvious that Buffy
doesn't need me anymore.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.463
And I don't say that
in a self-pitying way.

06:16.505 --> 06:19.682
I'm-- I'm quite proud,
actually.

06:19.726 --> 06:22.206
But what about
the rest of us?

06:22.250 --> 06:24.644
We still need
to be watched.

06:24.687 --> 06:27.690
Personally, I can't get
through a day without
a little hairy eyeball.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.432
[chuckles]
Well, I appreciate
the sentiment,

06:29.475 --> 06:31.694
but it's--
it's just not so.

06:31.738 --> 06:34.872
You'll be fine.
You all will.

06:34.915 --> 06:37.308
And you know,
we'll stay in touch.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.399
You can always--
always call me
whenever you like.

06:42.314 --> 06:45.492
When are you
gonna tell Buffy?Soon.

06:45.534 --> 06:48.711
It won't be easy,
but, uh...

06:48.755 --> 06:51.715
I know she'll understand.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.588
Thanks, Mom.
Everything was yummy.

06:54.630 --> 06:58.721
Hey, you up for dessert?
We could take a drive,
get some ice cream.

06:58.766 --> 07:01.725
You know, I would,
but I kinda have to
get out on patrol.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.509
Now? It's 8:30.

07:03.552 --> 07:06.163
Well, vamps don't really
care what time it is.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.687
You know,
dark equals dinner bell.

07:07.730 --> 07:11.822
Right. Of course.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.564
You know, I'm gonna have to
get used to this place
without you again.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.391
It gets so quiet.

07:16.435 --> 07:19.874
You know, maybe we should make
a regular date of this
when school starts.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.920
-Mmm.
-I'm sorry.

07:22.963 --> 07:25.574
Duty calls.
It's a total drag.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.620
[grunting]

07:31.451 --> 07:33.495
-[yelling]
-[snarling]

07:47.336 --> 07:48.685
[gasps]

07:58.129 --> 08:00.218
[snarling ends]

08:12.274 --> 08:13.971
MAN WITH EUROPEAN ACCENT:
Very impressive hunt.

08:15.843 --> 08:19.673
Such power.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.980
That was no hunt.
That was just
another day on the job.

08:25.242 --> 08:27.028
Care to step up
for some overtime?

08:27.071 --> 08:30.684
We're not
going to fight.

08:30.726 --> 08:32.686
Do you know
what a Slayer is?

08:32.729 --> 08:35.427
Do you?

08:37.385 --> 08:38.952
Who are you?

08:38.995 --> 08:41.042
I apologize.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.826
I assumed you knew.

08:43.870 --> 08:45.960
I am Dracula.

08:48.831 --> 08:50.965
Get out.

08:56.491 --> 09:00.278
Xand, what if
somebody had a secret,

09:00.322 --> 09:02.759
and that somebody
promised somebody else

09:02.802 --> 09:04.847
that they wouldn't
tell anyone?

09:04.892 --> 09:07.634
News flash, Wil.
Everybody knows.

09:07.677 --> 09:10.854
No, this isn't
about me and Tara.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.942
Oh. Well, not that I
wouldn't be all ears

09:12.986 --> 09:15.032
if you wanted to tell me
a secret about you two.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.860
Even if it was
very, very naughty.Sorry.

09:17.904 --> 09:19.732
This is of
the non-naughty variety,

09:19.775 --> 09:22.692
and I'm not telling you.

09:22.735 --> 09:25.302
Okay. Want to see if
Buffy's hanging around
the headstones?

09:25.346 --> 09:28.524
Sure. So if I was
gonna tell you,
which I'm not going to--

09:28.567 --> 09:30.787
So let me
get this straight.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.268
You're... Dracula,

09:33.311 --> 09:35.443
The guy, the Count.

09:35.486 --> 09:37.489
I am.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.883
And you're sure this isn't
just some fan-boy thing?

09:39.927 --> 09:41.668
'Cause I've fought
more than a couple

09:41.711 --> 09:45.062
pimply, overweight vamps
that called themselves Lestat.

09:45.105 --> 09:48.065
You know who I am.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.980
As I would know
without question

09:50.024 --> 09:52.243
that you are
Buffy Summers.

09:54.071 --> 09:57.813
-You've heard of me?
-Naturally.

09:57.857 --> 10:00.903
You are known
throughout the world.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.038
Nah. Really?

10:05.081 --> 10:07.868
Why else
would I come here?

10:07.910 --> 10:09.739
For the sun?

10:11.914 --> 10:15.222
I came to meet
the renowned killer.

10:15.265 --> 10:18.705
Yeah, I prefer the term Slayer.
You know, killer
just sounds so--

10:18.748 --> 10:20.663
Naked?

10:20.706 --> 10:24.274
Like I paint clowns
or something.

10:24.318 --> 10:26.886
I'm the good guy,
remember?

10:26.929 --> 10:30.673
Perhaps, but your power
is rooted in darkness.

10:30.716 --> 10:32.806
You must feel it.

10:34.894 --> 10:37.854
No.
You know what I feel?

10:37.898 --> 10:39.376
Bored.

10:48.342 --> 10:51.346
Okay, that's cheating.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.347
Hey, Buff, what's up?

10:53.390 --> 10:55.871
You look like
you just--Get out of here. Now.

10:55.915 --> 10:59.179
Fine, but I was gonna
give you a sip of my
double-mint mocha, but--

10:59.222 --> 11:00.355
Behind you.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.707
-Hi.
-Nice.

11:05.751 --> 11:08.711
Look who's
got a bad case
of Dark Prince envy.

11:08.754 --> 11:11.845
I have no interest
in you. Leave us.

11:11.888 --> 11:15.500
No, we're not going
to leave you.

11:15.543 --> 11:17.980
And where'd you
get that accent,
Sesame Street?

11:18.024 --> 11:21.375
Vun, two, three--
three victims.
Mwa ha ha ha!

11:21.418 --> 11:25.946
Xander, I'm pretty sure
that's Dracula.

11:27.207 --> 11:29.993
Wow, really?

11:30.037 --> 11:33.213
Hey, sorry, man.
I was...
Just jokin' around.

11:33.256 --> 11:35.695
This is not the time.

11:38.653 --> 11:40.090
I will see you soon.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.962
[wings flapping, screeching]

11:48.272 --> 11:52.145
Bat!

11:52.188 --> 11:56.628
And Buffy's all, "Look out!"
And then friggin' Dracula's
standing right behind us.

11:56.672 --> 11:59.761
And then
he lunges at us,
like, whoosh!

11:59.806 --> 12:01.371
He totally looked shorter
in person.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.897
I told you he'd heard of me.
I mean, can you believe that?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.812
Count Famous heard of me.

12:05.855 --> 12:10.206
I couldn't believe it the first
20 times you told us, but it's
starting to sink in now.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.383
I'm sorry.
Am I repeat-o girl?

12:12.427 --> 12:14.384
I was just...
blown away.

12:14.428 --> 12:17.823
It's not that surprising
that he's heard of you, Buffy.
You are the slayer.

12:17.866 --> 12:21.043
I guess.
It was just the way
he said it, you know.

12:21.087 --> 12:23.220
I mean, he made it
sound so--

12:23.264 --> 12:26.701
Sexy? I bet
he made it sound sexy.Kinda.

12:26.745 --> 12:30.966
He had the dark,
penetrating eyes
and lilty accent.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.576
XANDER: I wonder
if he knows Frankenstein.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.057
You thought Dracula was sexy?

12:35.188 --> 12:38.845
Oh! No.
He-he was-- yuck.

12:38.888 --> 12:41.977
Right, except for
the whole tall, dark
and handsome thing.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.720
-Yucko.
-How would you know?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.375
Well, we hung out
a few times.

12:47.418 --> 12:50.725
Back in my demon days.
You know, once or twice.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.033
He's pretty cool.
[sighs]

12:53.076 --> 12:56.384
You know, from
a whole evil-thing
perspective.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.472
Please.
He was no big whoop.

12:58.515 --> 13:01.868
WILLOW: No big whoop?
What about that thing where
he turned himself into a bat?

13:01.910 --> 13:04.434
That was awesome.GILES:
It must have been, yes.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.437
I must admit.
I'm sorry I missed that.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.092
Me too. The whole time
i was thinking,

13:10.136 --> 13:14.053
"Gosh, I wish Giles were here.
He'd know what to do."

13:14.096 --> 13:16.447
Didn't you guys...
think that?

13:16.490 --> 13:19.494
Actually, I was
more thinking, "Bat!"

13:19.537 --> 13:23.498
-How come he can do that?
-I have no idea.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.500
There's a great deal
of myth about Dracula.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.850
I imagine the trick
to defeating him

13:27.894 --> 13:29.895
lies in separating
the fact from
the fiction.

13:29.938 --> 13:32.855
Great point!
That is so Giles

13:32.899 --> 13:35.118
to think of something
like that, you know?

13:35.162 --> 13:38.251
That-- that
we would have never--

13:38.294 --> 13:41.254
So we should take things
slow with Dracula.

13:41.298 --> 13:44.258
I mean, he said that
we would meet again, but I
would like to avoid that

13:44.301 --> 13:46.520
until we do
some serious homework.RILEY: I don't know.

13:46.563 --> 13:49.653
I mean, he may have a bunch
of swell party tricks,
but he's still just a vampire.

13:49.697 --> 13:52.048
I say we load up
with stakes and crossbows
and go after him now.

13:52.091 --> 13:54.224
-Second.
-No, Buffy's right.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.705
Dracula's too slick
to fall for
the usual stuff.

13:56.748 --> 14:00.100
So we hold off.
No killing until we know
exactly what we're dealing with.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.884
You're not just saying that
because of those dark,

14:01.927 --> 14:04.451
penetrating eyes of his,
are you?

14:04.495 --> 14:06.932
No, his eyes were--

14:06.975 --> 14:09.326
They were--
There was no penetration.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.327
Cross my heart.

14:11.371 --> 14:13.982
All right. Um, Willow,

14:14.027 --> 14:15.942
you and Tara find out
everything you can

14:15.985 --> 14:17.899
about the actual legend
of Vlad the Impaler
on the Internet,

14:17.943 --> 14:20.684
and, uh,
I'll check the library.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.730
If the Initiative
was still around,

14:22.774 --> 14:24.951
we'd be able to find
everything on this guy
in a few hours.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.908
We may not be as fast,
but we'll find him.

14:26.952 --> 14:30.913
-You guys, we'll reconvene
here in the morning.
-[all murmuring assent]

14:30.956 --> 14:33.088
What's your plan?

14:33.133 --> 14:35.570
Big sleep.
My count encounter
wiped me out.

14:35.613 --> 14:38.138
I'm kind of wired.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.400
Maybe I should
just let you
get your rest.

14:40.530 --> 14:43.926
Are you sure?
I mean, maybe if you
just lie down with me--

14:43.970 --> 14:48.191
Nothing you are
about to say
will lead to rest.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.976
I guess you're right.
I'll see you
in the morning?

14:51.019 --> 14:52.629
Mm-hmm. With donuts.

14:52.673 --> 14:54.631
Mmm. Heaven.

14:57.548 --> 15:00.072
See? A little sugar
and I'm all yours.

15:00.115 --> 15:02.162
Dracula shmacula.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.206
I doubt
he'd remember me.

15:04.250 --> 15:07.994
I was just
a silly young thing.
I mean, like 700 or so.

15:08.037 --> 15:10.865
But he did say that
this guy I cursed
was doomed forever,

15:10.909 --> 15:12.823
which was really sweet,
don't you think?

15:12.868 --> 15:16.131
-Adorable.
-It was a great spell.

15:16.176 --> 15:19.352
I made this jerk
incredibly fat,
like a human minivan.

15:19.395 --> 15:21.006
[snarling]

15:21.049 --> 15:22.572
You should just
mention my name

15:22.616 --> 15:24.313
if you see him again.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.403
Or better yet,
why don't you just
go sit on top of a crypt

15:27.447 --> 15:30.668
and flaunt
your neck cleavage
until Dracula shows up?

15:30.711 --> 15:33.845
Then you two can talk private.Oh, please, don't
tell me you're jealous.

15:33.889 --> 15:36.847
Oh, no. Just because
you're panting
over the guy.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.980
I am not panting.

15:39.024 --> 15:43.072
Now, stop being silly.
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:43.115 --> 15:45.552
You don't want to
come back to my place?

15:45.596 --> 15:48.511
It's whites day, remember?
The bleach smell
makes me nauseous.

15:50.297 --> 15:54.256
Fine. I suppose Dracula
doesn't use bleach, huh?

15:55.519 --> 15:57.390
He's a darks-only man.

16:08.923 --> 16:11.057
Great. Perfect.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.408
You know what?
You're not so big.

16:15.451 --> 16:19.326
One round of old-fashioned
fisticuffs, I bet you'd
fold like a bitty baby.

16:21.110 --> 16:24.025
Okay, let's do it.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.072
But no poofin'.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.639
Come on, puffy shirt.
Pucker on up, 'cause you can
kiss your pale ass good--

16:28.682 --> 16:29.813
Silence.

16:29.857 --> 16:31.293
Yes, master.

16:31.337 --> 16:32.991
No, that's not--

16:34.557 --> 16:36.038
You will be my emissary,

16:36.081 --> 16:39.475
my eyes and ears
in daylight.

16:39.519 --> 16:41.303
Your emissary?

16:41.347 --> 16:42.826
Serve me well.

16:42.870 --> 16:45.655
You will be rewarded.

16:45.700 --> 16:49.442
I will make you
an immortal.

16:49.485 --> 16:53.490
A child of darkness
that feeds on life itself--

16:53.533 --> 16:55.971
on blood.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.278
Blood? Yes, yes!

16:58.321 --> 17:00.583
I will serve you,
your excellent
spookiness.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.893
Or master. I'll just
stick with master.

17:04.935 --> 17:07.200
You are strange
and off-putting.

17:07.242 --> 17:08.242
Go now.

17:10.550 --> 17:13.467
But, master,
how can I find--

17:15.163 --> 17:17.992
Brilliant.
What an exit.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.430
Guy's a genius.
[giggles]

17:20.473 --> 17:22.779
[giggling continues]

17:38.926 --> 17:42.234
Well, well. You can
take the boy out
of the Initiative,

17:42.278 --> 17:46.717
but you can't take
the Initiative out
of the boy.

17:46.760 --> 17:50.199
I'd put that down,
unless you're bucking
for one hell of a headache.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.987
I can't be too careful.

17:56.030 --> 17:59.338
I've got quite a few demons
after me these days.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.340
I'm lookin' for
some information.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.820
Might pay a little.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.823
I'll play.

18:08.217 --> 18:10.523
What can you tell me
about Dracula?

18:10.567 --> 18:13.961
[scoffs]
Dracula?

18:15.397 --> 18:17.965
Poncy bugger owes me
£11, for one thing.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.271
You know him?

18:19.315 --> 18:20.185
Know him?

18:20.229 --> 18:23.753
We're old rivals.

18:23.798 --> 18:28.541
But then he got famous
and forgot all about
his foes.

18:28.585 --> 18:32.022
I'll tell you what.
That glory hound's

18:32.067 --> 18:34.503
done more harm
to vampires than
any Slayer.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.942
His story gets out,
and suddenly everybody
knows how to kill us.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.423
You know, the mirror bit--But he's not just
a regular vampire.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.382
He has special
powers, right?

18:42.424 --> 18:44.731
Nothin' but
showy gypsy stuff.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.516
What's it to you,
anyway?

18:46.559 --> 18:51.607
He's in town,
making his presence known.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.133
Drac's in Sunnydale, way?

18:55.699 --> 18:59.311
I guess the old boy
needed closure
after all.

18:59.355 --> 19:02.618
Actually, he's
gunning for Buffy.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.448
But I'm out to find him
before he gets another
shot at her.

19:05.491 --> 19:09.799
Tough talk, cowboy.
But you're not gonna catch
him napping in a crypt.

19:09.844 --> 19:13.064
No, the Count has to have
his luxury estate

19:13.107 --> 19:16.633
and his bug-eaters
and his special dirt,
doesn't he?

19:18.417 --> 19:21.463
So you're saying
I should check out mansions,
that sort of thing?

19:21.508 --> 19:23.901
No.

19:23.944 --> 19:27.644
I'm saying
you should go home

19:27.688 --> 19:32.083
to your superhoney--
have a nice, safe snog.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.130
You're out of your depth
on this one, boy.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.263
You've helped
Buffy before,

19:38.307 --> 19:41.005
so she has a problem
with killing you
now that you're helpless.

19:41.048 --> 19:42.876
I don't.

19:48.490 --> 19:51.277
I'd like
to see you try.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.065
Would you?

20:03.070 --> 20:05.073
[scoffs]

20:10.773 --> 20:13.298
You're never
gonna find him.

20:16.388 --> 20:19.347
Not before he gets to her.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.903
[wind gusting]

20:53.948 --> 20:55.776
[gasps]

20:57.211 --> 21:00.737
You are magnificent.

21:00.780 --> 21:04.132
I bet you say that
before you bite
all the girls.

21:04.174 --> 21:07.353
No. You are different.

21:07.395 --> 21:09.746
Kindred.

21:10.921 --> 21:13.923
Kindred? Hardly--

21:13.968 --> 21:16.230
Pull your hair back.

21:21.279 --> 21:24.631
BUFFY:
This isn't how
I usually fight.

21:29.417 --> 21:32.595
You think you can just
waft in here with your
music-video wind

21:32.638 --> 21:34.380
and your hypno-eye-- eyes--

21:36.598 --> 21:40.298
I have searched
the world over for you.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.346
I have yearned for you.

21:46.608 --> 21:49.046
For a creature
whose darkness
rivals my own.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.880
You have been tasted.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.538
-He was--
-Unworthy.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.460
He let you go.

22:18.205 --> 22:20.643
But the embrace...

22:20.686 --> 22:22.557
his bite...

22:25.125 --> 22:26.910
you remember.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.434
No.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.574
Do not fight.

22:43.317 --> 22:45.145
I can feel your hunger.

22:48.627 --> 22:50.586
[bites neck]

22:54.938 --> 22:56.896
[gasping]

23:41.420 --> 23:45.249
Here's a jelly one.
You want it?No.

23:45.292 --> 23:46.903
Got it. Got it!
Mine, mine.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.559
Well, I think we have
Dracula factoids.

23:51.604 --> 23:54.650
Like any of that's
enough to fight
the Dark Master.

23:56.346 --> 23:57.913
Bator.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.741
A lot of it
we already knew.

23:59.786 --> 24:02.615
Turn-offs: wood,
fire, crosses, garlic.

24:02.657 --> 24:05.355
Turn-ons:
nice duds, minions,

24:05.400 --> 24:07.968
long slow bites
that last for days.

24:08.010 --> 24:11.753
RILEY: Yeah, I did a little
research too. Dracula likes
to live in style.

24:11.798 --> 24:14.713
Which means we can rule out
the usual dumps
vampires haunt.

24:14.757 --> 24:17.499
Ah, but he's smart enough
to figure that we'd probably
already know that.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.545
I'm guessin'
he's layin' low.

24:19.587 --> 24:22.416
Actually, my research
backs Riley up.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.549
Drac isn't
the lay-low type.

24:24.593 --> 24:27.335
So we can check out
the nicer places.

24:27.377 --> 24:28.989
Don't you think,
Buffy?

24:30.990 --> 24:32.339
Buffy?

24:33.776 --> 24:36.561
Yeah, we'll check all
the swanky places first.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.651
What else
did you guys get?

24:38.693 --> 24:42.306
Well, Willow has
most of it, actually.

24:42.349 --> 24:45.092
Only because you gave me
super pointers.
I never would have--

24:45.134 --> 24:47.442
Just... go ahead, Willow.

24:48.703 --> 24:50.923
Okay. Dracula's
modus operandi

24:50.967 --> 24:53.230
is different
from other vampires.

24:53.273 --> 24:55.405
He will kill just to feed,

24:55.450 --> 24:57.799
but he'd rather have
a connection with
his victims,

24:57.844 --> 25:02.152
and he has all of these
mental powers to draw them in.

25:02.195 --> 25:04.459
He-- he can read
and control minds

25:04.502 --> 25:06.679
and appear in dreams.

25:06.721 --> 25:08.810
Uh-huh.

25:08.855 --> 25:12.118
Makes sense. That stare--

25:12.162 --> 25:14.643
He just kinda
looked right through you.

25:14.686 --> 25:16.515
Didn't you feel it,
Buffy?

25:19.821 --> 25:23.259
No.
No, I didn't.

25:23.304 --> 25:26.567
See?
Buffy didn't feel it.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.048
I think you're drawing
a lot of crazy conclusions
about the Unholy Prince!

25:30.702 --> 25:32.269
Bator.

25:33.749 --> 25:36.011
The point is,
though he goes
through the motions

25:36.056 --> 25:37.926
of an intimate seduction,

25:37.971 --> 25:41.409
the end result is the same--
he turns them into
a vampire.

25:41.451 --> 25:45.368
Well, that is intimate.

25:45.413 --> 25:47.675
Dracula's gifting
these ladies with
his own blood.

25:48.676 --> 25:50.113
And blood--

25:51.723 --> 25:53.508
Blood is life.

25:55.291 --> 25:58.164
According to them.
[pounds table]

25:58.208 --> 26:02.385
Um, just be aware that he tends
to form a relationship
with his prey.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.737
It's not enough for him
to take her.

26:04.779 --> 26:08.784
She must want to be taken.
She must, uh, burn for him.

26:08.827 --> 26:12.527
That's interesting.
I'm gonna go find him.

26:12.570 --> 26:15.442
You shouldn't go
by yourself, Buffy. I mean,
this guy's seriously dangerous.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.227
It's cool. I got it.

26:22.798 --> 26:26.323
Hey.
Take off that scarf.

26:26.366 --> 26:28.891
What? No.

26:28.934 --> 26:32.112
You're under the thrall
of the Dark Prince.

26:32.154 --> 26:35.855
Oh, I am not
under the thrall
of the Dark Prince.

26:35.897 --> 26:37.987
Then take off the scarf.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.468
Oh, let go of me!
This is ridiculous.

26:40.510 --> 26:43.165
[footsteps approaching]

26:54.700 --> 26:57.310
GILES:
Well, why didn't she
say anything?

26:57.354 --> 27:00.227
'Cause she didn't want to
worry us, right, Buffster?
It's nothin'. Just a scratch.

27:00.269 --> 27:03.577
Two deep,
puncture-y scratches.

27:07.146 --> 27:10.279
I'm not sure why
I tried to hide it.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.848
Uh, there was
just this voice,

27:13.893 --> 27:16.547
and it was telling me
to cover it.

27:16.590 --> 27:17.722
And what did I tell you?

27:17.766 --> 27:19.681
That's thrall.

27:19.724 --> 27:22.944
You're saying Dracula has
some sort of freaky
mind control over her?

27:22.989 --> 27:24.859
You're watchin' too many
creature features, man.[fly buzzing]

27:24.903 --> 27:28.558
BUFFY:
It does seem like
he has this control over me,

27:28.603 --> 27:30.560
even though a big part
of me is resisting.

27:30.605 --> 27:33.913
No, that's okay.
I-- I shouldn't
take this personally.

27:33.955 --> 27:35.827
I mean,
what with Angel.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.568
I mean, it's understandable
that there would be
transference.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.180
I mean, they're both
broody immortals.

27:43.530 --> 27:46.359
I am not transfer-y.

27:48.013 --> 27:50.277
I swear to you.

27:50.319 --> 27:52.758
I'm your girl,
and I'm gonna
stay that way.

27:52.887 --> 27:57.197
Okay. But you are not going
anywhere near him again.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.200
Uh, Riley's right.
You should stay
out of sight.

28:00.242 --> 28:02.897
Let the rest of us
look for Dracula.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.814
I can't go home.
He already got
inside once.

28:05.857 --> 28:08.511
You can come over to my place.
I'll make sure you stay put.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.992
Good.
Riley and I can--

28:11.037 --> 28:12.994
can search
for Dracula

28:13.038 --> 28:16.564
and Willow, you and Tara
could do a protection
spell at Buffy's house

28:16.606 --> 28:18.740
to prevent him
from returning.

28:18.784 --> 28:22.439
Got it. How'd he get
inside anyway?

28:22.482 --> 28:26.226
He seemed
so nice and normal.
A little pale.

28:26.269 --> 28:29.969
A good Sunnydale rule of thumb?
Avoid white-skinned men
in capes.

28:30.011 --> 28:32.623
I'm not like this.
I don't invite strange
men over for coffee.

28:32.666 --> 28:37.802
It's just--
Oh, when you girls are
older you'll understand.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.457
It's hard to date.
Sometimes you just

28:40.500 --> 28:42.459
feel like giving up
on men altogether.

28:51.032 --> 28:54.427
-Another bust.
-And it's getting dark.

28:54.471 --> 28:57.473
I should have turned up
a better lead. There must be
an easier way to find him.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.476
Ah, too late to worry
about that now.

28:59.519 --> 29:02.174
If we hurry, we can hit
these last places.

29:02.218 --> 29:04.046
ANYA:
How come I have to
be here Slayer-sitting

29:04.089 --> 29:06.005
while the other guys
get to look for Dracula?

29:06.048 --> 29:07.833
-I mean, just because I'm--
-What time is it?

29:07.875 --> 29:10.400
Uh, almost 6:00.

29:10.443 --> 29:11.967
Look, I mean, I'm the one
who knows him.

29:12.010 --> 29:13.795
I'm the one who had
a really good look at him.

29:13.838 --> 29:16.492
And so, I mean--
What? Hey, what? Hey! Hey!

29:16.537 --> 29:19.365
[muffled shouting, pounding]

29:19.409 --> 29:21.063
I'm supposed
to deliver you
to the master now.

29:23.065 --> 29:26.067
There's this whole deal
where I get to be immortal.
You cool with that?

29:26.112 --> 29:27.026
[pounding on door]

29:27.068 --> 29:29.419
Take me to him.

29:29.462 --> 29:31.290
ANYA:
Come on, Xander!
This isn't funny!

29:31.334 --> 29:32.988
[pounding continues]

29:48.655 --> 29:50.832
Master?
I deliver the Slayer.

29:50.875 --> 29:54.356
She who you most desire.
Sorry. Whom.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.884
So now comes
the immortality, right?
You do the thing and--

29:59.927 --> 30:03.539
Leave us.
We must not
be interrupted.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.759
You bet.

30:10.895 --> 30:13.028
I knew you'd come.

30:13.071 --> 30:14.942
Why?

30:16.902 --> 30:19.164
Because I'm under
your thrall?

30:20.557 --> 30:23.125
Well, guess again, pal.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.647
Put the stake down.

30:24.692 --> 30:25.824
Okay.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.134
Right.

30:32.177 --> 30:37.009
That was not you.
I did that.

30:37.051 --> 30:40.403
I did that because...
I wanted to.

30:43.057 --> 30:48.280
Maybe I should rethink
that thrall thing.
[whimpers]

30:55.766 --> 30:58.508
I've lived in Sunnydale
a couple of years now.

30:58.551 --> 31:01.510
Know what I've
never noticed before?Uh, a castle?

31:01.555 --> 31:03.338
A big, honking castle.

31:29.451 --> 31:31.846
Stay away from me.

31:31.890 --> 31:35.371
Are you afraid
I will bite you?

31:37.199 --> 31:39.593
Slayer, that's why you came.

31:40.810 --> 31:43.336
No. Last night--

31:45.207 --> 31:47.339
It's not gonna
happen again.

31:47.383 --> 31:51.170
Stop me.
Stake me.

31:51.212 --> 31:54.433
Uh, any minute now.

31:54.477 --> 31:58.089
Do you know why
you cannot resist?

31:58.133 --> 32:00.743
'Cause you're famous?

32:00.788 --> 32:02.963
Because you
do not want to.

32:05.662 --> 32:08.099
-My friends are--
-They're here.

32:08.143 --> 32:11.190
They will not find us.

32:11.232 --> 32:13.147
We are alone...

32:17.021 --> 32:18.936
Always alone.

32:21.721 --> 32:25.116
There is so much
I have to teach you--

32:25.160 --> 32:28.032
Your history,
your power,

32:28.076 --> 32:30.251
what your body
is capable of.

32:32.253 --> 32:35.561
-I don't need to know.
-You long to,

32:35.605 --> 32:40.959
And you will have eternity
to discover yourself.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.833
But first...

32:45.875 --> 32:47.748
a little taste.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.795
I won't let you.

32:51.838 --> 32:55.103
I didn't mean for me.

33:09.464 --> 33:11.292
Nobody harms my master.

33:11.336 --> 33:13.077
Your master?

33:13.121 --> 33:15.210
You want him?

33:15.253 --> 33:17.125
You come through me.

33:20.519 --> 33:23.000
Okeydoke.

33:36.188 --> 33:38.493
[gasps]

33:38.538 --> 33:41.192
[groans]
Good show, Giles.

33:41.236 --> 33:44.282
Oh, at least you
didn't get knocked out,
for a change.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.895
[groaning]

33:48.939 --> 33:51.376
Oh, ladies.

33:52.682 --> 33:55.468
You would be
the Three Sisters, yes?

33:57.251 --> 34:01.778
Excellent. Right.
Uh, I'd heard that
you were a myth.

34:01.821 --> 34:05.607
Obviously erroneous.
[gasping]

34:06.957 --> 34:10.222
Ooh, that's--
that's--

34:10.264 --> 34:12.311
Tickles.

34:12.353 --> 34:16.141
Ooh, oh, uh--
oh, dear god.

34:21.188 --> 34:24.322
What are you--All these years
fighting us,

34:24.364 --> 34:27.152
your power so near
to our own...

34:28.414 --> 34:31.329
and you've never once
wanted to know

34:31.373 --> 34:33.853
what it is
that we fight for?

34:35.289 --> 34:37.858
Never even a taste?

34:41.862 --> 34:45.387
If I drink that--I have not drunk enough
for you to change.

34:45.431 --> 34:48.172
You must be near death
to become one of us,

34:48.215 --> 34:51.914
and that comes only
when you plead for it.

34:51.958 --> 34:54.744
-I'm not hungry.
-No.

34:54.788 --> 34:58.139
Your craving
goes deeper than that.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.407
You think you know...

35:05.451 --> 35:08.106
what you are,
what's to come.

35:09.541 --> 35:13.762
You haven't even begun.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.355
Find it.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.967
The darkness.

35:44.010 --> 35:47.144
Find your true nature.

35:48.362 --> 35:50.757
[heartbeat pounding]

35:50.800 --> 35:52.150
[shouts]

35:56.023 --> 35:58.634
Wow.

35:58.677 --> 36:01.246
[grunts]

36:01.289 --> 36:03.682
That was gross.

36:06.119 --> 36:07.947
You are resisting.

36:09.514 --> 36:10.864
Looks like.

36:10.907 --> 36:14.215
Come here. Come to me.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.434
You know, I really
think the thrall

36:16.478 --> 36:19.438
has gone out
of our relationship.

36:19.481 --> 36:22.135
But I want to thank you
for opening up
my eyes a little.

36:22.179 --> 36:23.833
What is this?

36:23.876 --> 36:25.704
My true nature.

36:25.748 --> 36:28.141
You want a taste?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.188
[snarls]

36:42.983 --> 36:46.028
Buffy, are you in--

36:46.072 --> 36:48.293
Giles! Giles!

36:51.860 --> 36:54.733
-Come on, come on.
Grab my hand.
-Thank god you came.

36:54.777 --> 36:59.172
-Come on!
-There was no possible escape.

37:02.523 --> 37:04.438
[grunting]

37:07.398 --> 37:09.487
-You're okay.
-[gasping]

37:09.530 --> 37:11.967
My shoe. Silly me.
I'll just pop--

37:12.012 --> 37:14.362
No, no, no, sir!
No more chick pit
for you. Come on.

37:52.443 --> 37:55.273
A guy like you should
think about going electric.
Seriously.

38:07.762 --> 38:09.460
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

38:10.592 --> 38:12.681
How do you like
my darkness now?

38:12.724 --> 38:14.856
-[snarling]
-[dagger thrusts]

38:26.085 --> 38:28.567
Buffy.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.786
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

38:30.829 --> 38:33.485
Chock-full
of free will.

38:33.527 --> 38:35.050
And Dracula?

38:35.094 --> 38:37.619
Euro-trashed.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.708
Where is he?

38:39.751 --> 38:42.231
Where's the creep that turned me
into his spider-eating
man-bitch?

38:42.275 --> 38:45.365
-He's gone.
-Damn it!

38:45.409 --> 38:48.630
You know what?
I'm sick of this crap.

38:48.673 --> 38:52.634
I'm sick of being
the guy who eats insects
and gets the funny syphilis.

38:52.677 --> 38:55.724
As of this moment,
it's over.

38:55.768 --> 38:58.771
I'm finished being
everybody's butt monkey.

39:00.641 --> 39:02.601
Check.
No more
butt monkey.

39:02.643 --> 39:04.253
It could have been worse.

39:04.297 --> 39:06.213
At least you weren't
making time with the Dracu-babes
like Giles here.

39:06.255 --> 39:10.434
That was not making time.
I-- I was just about to kill
those loathsome creatures

39:10.478 --> 39:12.262
when Riley
interrupted me.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.612
Really?
You were gonna
nuzzle 'em to death?

39:14.655 --> 39:17.702
Of course not.
I was in complete...

39:19.487 --> 39:21.402
control.

39:38.505 --> 39:41.248
-[gasping]
-You think I don't
watch your movies?

39:41.291 --> 39:43.076
You always come back.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.563
BUFFY:
I'm standing right here.

39:55.523 --> 39:57.090
BUFFY:
You wanted to see me?

39:57.132 --> 39:59.701
Yes. Uh... Thanks for coming.

39:59.744 --> 40:01.442
Can I offer you some tea?

40:01.485 --> 40:03.009
Oh, no, thanks.

40:03.052 --> 40:05.577
Ooh, cookies.

40:05.619 --> 40:08.449
How come I rate little
cookie treatment?

40:08.492 --> 40:11.931
Well, actually, I have
something to tell you.

40:11.974 --> 40:15.456
Actually, I have something
that I'd like to talk
to you about too.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.588
Well, you go first,
by all means.

40:17.632 --> 40:20.199
-No. Go ahead.
-No, I insist.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.641
You haven't been
my Watcher for a while.

40:28.425 --> 40:31.864
I haven't
been training...

40:31.907 --> 40:34.996
and I haven't really
needed to come
to you for help.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.565
I agree.

40:42.570 --> 40:46.181
And then this whole
thing with Dracula--

40:46.226 --> 40:48.445
It made me face up
to some stuff.

40:50.969 --> 40:53.755
Ever since
we did that spell

40:53.798 --> 40:57.193
where we called on
the first Slayer,

40:57.237 --> 40:59.152
I've been
going out a lot.

41:01.153 --> 41:04.461
-Every night.
-Patrolling?

41:05.550 --> 41:07.594
Hunting.

41:07.639 --> 41:10.771
That's what Dracula
called it,

41:10.815 --> 41:13.775
and he was right.

41:13.818 --> 41:16.690
He understood my power
better than I do.

41:18.431 --> 41:20.695
He saw darkness in it.

41:23.262 --> 41:25.744
I need to know more...

41:25.786 --> 41:29.704
about where I come from,
about the other Slayers.

41:29.748 --> 41:31.923
I mean, maybe--

41:31.967 --> 41:35.405
Maybe if I can learn
to control this thing,
I could be stronger,

41:35.449 --> 41:37.711
I could be better.

41:37.755 --> 41:40.846
But I'm scared.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.632
I know it's
gonna be hard.

41:44.675 --> 41:47.809
And I can't do it

41:47.853 --> 41:49.811
without you.

41:51.246 --> 41:53.641
I need your help.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.777
I need you to be
my Watcher again.

42:03.476 --> 42:04.956
[sighs]

42:05.000 --> 42:07.829
Boy, I just-- I just
keep talking, don't I?

42:07.873 --> 42:10.527
I'm sorry. You--
you had something
you wanted to say.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.619
No.

42:14.661 --> 42:16.534
No, it's nothing.

42:26.239 --> 42:28.981
I'm out of here.
Riley and I are going
to the movies.

42:29.023 --> 42:31.418
Okay. Have a good time.

42:33.289 --> 42:35.726
What are you doing here?

42:39.208 --> 42:42.036
Buffy? If you're going out,
why don't you take
your sister?

42:43.516 --> 42:46.128
-Mom!
-Mom!

43:23.121 --> 43:24.818
Grr! Arrgh!
