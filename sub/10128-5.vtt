TO BE AVERAGE.

10:52.700 --> 10:56.567

IN THERE, AND HE WON'T
COME OUT FOR ANYBODY.

AVERAGE WAS A DREAM.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.934
THAT'S WHY MY FATHER
WORKED HIS BUTT OFF.

15:31.934 --> 15:35.233
SO MAYBE HIS SON
COULD HAVE SOMETHING MORE.

15:35.233 --> 15:37.300

I THINK HE'S ALIVE.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.300
WHAT CAN I DO FOR HIM?

20:36.300 --> 20:38.033
OH, I KNOW.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.567
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH
RESUSCITATION.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.400
OH, SHOOT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:45.400 --> 20:47.467
I DON'T KNOW MOUTH-TO-MOUTH
RESUSCITATION.

20:47.467 --> 20:49.367
DO YOU KNOW CPR, JACK?

20:49.367 --> 20:50.934
YES, I DO.

20:50.934 --> 20:55.300
SO JUST, UH, MOVE ASIDE
THERE, SWEETHEART.

20:57.934 --> 21:00.500
OH, YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.
MAKE FUN OF THE DEAD.
