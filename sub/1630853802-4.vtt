WEBVTT

00:07.507 --> 00:08.758
- What brings you two
to Akumal?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.135
- It's our
ten year anniversary.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.845
Holy shit.
[screams]

00:11.886 --> 00:13.346
- This phone belonged
to Sam Lawford

00:13.388 --> 00:14.931
who went missing 15 years ago.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.349
- [gasps]
Holy shit.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.059
- Violet Thompson
was also reported missing.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.354
- Baltasar Frías,
who was our prime suspect.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.190
But the storm
washed everything away

00:24.232 --> 00:26.026
before I got any evidence.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.445
- Em, you should see this.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.654
- Which means that
that's the pent--

00:29.696 --> 00:31.573
[gasps]
That's Sam and Violet!

00:31.614 --> 00:33.533
* *

00:33.575 --> 00:35.035
- [gasps, screams]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:35.076 --> 00:36.703
- I met a guy.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.871
We have a date tonight.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.080
- [chuckles]

00:40.415 --> 00:41.666
- I found your board.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.043
- What skateboard?

00:43.084 --> 00:44.336
- Hey!
- [grunts]

00:44.377 --> 00:45.587
- [gasps]
Sam?

00:45.628 --> 00:48.548
* *

00:54.637 --> 00:56.348
- Man, Creepy Santa
keeps getting creepier.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.766
[elevator dings]
Oh, shit.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.228
- [whispering]
That's Baltasar Frías.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.897
He's got the phone.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.523
* *

01:05.565 --> 01:07.400
- [yelps]

01:07.442 --> 01:09.277
[phone buzzing]
- No!

01:11.696 --> 01:13.365
- [yelps]

01:14.407 --> 01:17.452
[indistinct shouting]

01:18.995 --> 01:21.623
[phone buzzing]
- No!

01:23.625 --> 01:25.126
[clattering]

01:26.878 --> 01:28.380
[grunting]

01:28.421 --> 01:31.508
[tense music]

01:31.549 --> 01:35.095
[grunting]

01:35.136 --> 01:41.059
* *

01:41.101 --> 01:42.560
- What are you doing?

01:42.602 --> 01:44.562
- I figured we could, like,

01:44.604 --> 01:46.606
lock him in a closet
or something.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.274
- No, no, no, no, no.
We can't just leave him here.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.401
- Why not?
He's clearly not dead.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.610
- What were you even thinking?

01:50.652 --> 01:51.903
- I couldn't let
him take the phone.

01:51.945 --> 01:52.987
- So you tried to kill him?

01:53.029 --> 01:54.155
- He's fine.
- [moans]

01:54.197 --> 01:55.740
- Oh!

01:55.782 --> 01:57.534
- [whispers] The phone rang.
Did you see that?

01:57.575 --> 01:59.953
- What--what--what are you
even talking about...

01:59.994 --> 02:01.079
- The phone rang.
- Right now?

02:01.121 --> 02:03.039
- [screaming]
- Ah, fuck! Fuck.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.500
- It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.337
[grunts]
[panting]

02:10.839 --> 02:14.926
- What an unusual turn
of events.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.721
- What are you doing here?

02:17.762 --> 02:20.098
- Well, I heard
you found the phone.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.975
- Who told you that?

02:22.017 --> 02:23.643
- An old friend.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.853
- Oh, Luna.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.312
- Yeah, where is--
where is the phone now?

02:26.354 --> 02:27.856
- It's in a million pieces

02:27.897 --> 02:29.816
at the bottom of the fucking
elevator shaft because of you.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.110
- No, the impulse to destroy it
came from you.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.319
- Hey, maybe you
should sit down, man.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.364
- I'm okay.
- Sit the fuck down!

02:36.406 --> 02:37.699
- But, Em, chill out.
- What?

02:37.741 --> 02:39.034
We don't know what
he's going to do.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.285
He's acting like
a loose cannon.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.494
- Yeah, well,
you have the weapon,

02:41.536 --> 02:44.539
and I have not provoked you
in any way.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.627
- What did you do
to Sam and Violet?

02:50.754 --> 02:54.758
- You--you think
I did something to them?

02:55.967 --> 02:58.053
- Yeah.
- Why?

02:58.094 --> 02:59.971
- 'Cause you had
Sam's skateboard,

03:00.013 --> 03:03.433
and because I know about
you and your family.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.438
- And that's all
of your evidence?

03:10.565 --> 03:13.318
[chuckles] Let me--
let me tell you something.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.072
I come from a family
of tailors, hmm?

03:17.113 --> 03:18.698
Not murderers.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.910
So if this is where
your investigation has led you,

03:21.951 --> 03:26.748
I'm not sure you're capable of
believing the true story, hmm?

03:28.124 --> 03:31.670
[panting]
What are your names?

03:33.797 --> 03:37.133
Okay, don't tell me.
Are you guys married?

03:37.175 --> 03:39.552
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, oh, okay.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.970
I think it's time to go.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.889
You--you seem good.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.684
This all seems to be
a big misunderstanding, so--

03:45.725 --> 03:49.854
- Well, maybe, maybe we can
understand it together, no?

03:52.148 --> 03:54.901
- What's the true story?

03:54.943 --> 03:56.569
- [sighs]

03:56.611 --> 03:58.571
What happened
to Sam and Violet

03:58.613 --> 04:01.491
is just one thread
in a tapestry

04:01.533 --> 04:05.370
of interconnected stories.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.580
[sighs]

04:07.622 --> 04:10.333
Everything comes back
to the Oceana Vista

04:10.375 --> 04:13.128
and the tragic demise

04:13.169 --> 04:16.464
of its misunderstood owner,

04:16.506 --> 04:19.592
Alexander Vasilakis.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.804
No one knew exactly
where Alex came from.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.390
One rumor was that
he just wandered

04:25.432 --> 04:27.142
out of the jungle one day

04:27.183 --> 04:30.145
with only a dream
of opening a resort.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.731
A more accepted rumor
was that he was born

04:32.772 --> 04:34.315
in a family
of hedge fund managers,

04:34.357 --> 04:37.152
and then he stole a yacht
and moved to Quintana Roo

04:37.193 --> 04:40.405
to start his own path.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.491
Alex possessed
a profound human insight

04:43.533 --> 04:46.536
and belief
in the potential of others.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.663
But let me be clear.

04:48.705 --> 04:53.376
This man was not
a brilliant man.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.670
- You into
metaphysical shit, man?

04:58.506 --> 05:01.760
- I am not sure what you mean.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.804
- Good answer.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.348
Sit.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.640
- Yes.

05:11.353 --> 05:15.565
- And you are Baltasar Peniche?

05:15.607 --> 05:18.985
- Yes, sir. Yes.
- It sounds made-up.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.364
So you are applying for--

05:22.405 --> 05:23.615
- Any job.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.742
I heard you were
hiring all positions.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.161
- Bold move--
or the move of a fickle man

05:28.203 --> 05:30.997
who doesn't know what he wants,
so what exactly do you want?

05:31.039 --> 05:33.500
- Like, in life, or--

05:33.541 --> 05:36.503
- Because I get this feeling

05:36.544 --> 05:38.254
like you're running
from something,

05:38.296 --> 05:40.006
rather than running towards it.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.470
Let's go to the beach.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.431
So why here, Peniche?
Why this resort?

05:48.473 --> 05:50.975
- Because you're hiring?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.602
- That's true.
Thanks for the honesty.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.145
Yeah, we're hiring.

05:54.187 --> 05:58.400
But it's more of a factory
where we mass produce

05:58.441 --> 06:02.028
the single most precious thing
that humans are capable of.

06:02.070 --> 06:06.157
- Hm. Children.
- No, no, no, memories.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.243
- Oh. Yeah.
- Memories.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.995
- Memories can be bad, too, no?

06:13.456 --> 06:15.750
- Thumb wrestle.
Let's do it.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.795
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.547
You're not even trying.
What are you doing?

06:20.588 --> 06:21.715
- okay, okay, I know, I know.

06:21.756 --> 06:25.051
- Okay.
If you win, you get the job.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.054
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.556
All right, rapid fire.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.391
What is your first memory
of joy, motherfucker?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.226
- Um, I don't know, sir.
- Try.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.936
- I've had a complicated life.
- Okay, cool, me too.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.896
Everyone does.
But it all starts from joy.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.648
The first memory is joy, and
everything springs from that.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.692
So what the fuck is it?
- Uh, reading.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.235
I like reading, sir.
- Terrible reader over here.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.570
What are we reading?

06:43.611 --> 06:44.988
- Detective novels.
- Why detective novels?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.656
- Because my father gave me
those when I was a kid.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.159
- Okay, you and your father
were close?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.577
Come on!
Don't stop!

06:50.618 --> 06:52.203
- The reason I like
detective novels, sir,

06:52.245 --> 06:53.455
is because I understand them.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.914
They raise questions
that always have answers.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.500
They try to answer both
the mystery of a crime

06:57.542 --> 06:58.835
and the mystery of life.
- Ah, come on!

06:58.877 --> 07:00.920
- And I like the characters!
- Which characters?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.630
- The detectives, sir!
- Why the detectives?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.215
- Because they're obsessed
and alone

07:04.257 --> 07:06.009
and they're home is on the edge
of the void of hopelessness.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.302
- That's why
you like detectives?

07:07.344 --> 07:08.303
That is so fucking weird,
Peniche.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.596
- They want to do
the right thing,

07:09.637 --> 07:10.597
even if that kills them.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.723
It's for a greater good.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.891
- You think
it's gonna kill you?

07:12.932 --> 07:14.142
- I don't know!
I don't know, sir!

07:14.184 --> 07:15.477
Ah!
Ah!

07:15.518 --> 07:16.770
I don't know!
I don't know!

07:16.811 --> 07:18.188
- Do you feel alone?
- Yes!

07:18.229 --> 07:20.106
- Is there a world
in which joy and loneliness

07:20.148 --> 07:22.067
can exist in harmony?
- Yeah, sometimes!

07:22.108 --> 07:23.526
- But do you want
to be alone, Peniche?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.403
Do you want to be alone?
- No, I don't want to be alone!

07:25.445 --> 07:26.654
I don't want to be alone!

07:26.696 --> 07:28.031
- Then what do you want
to be, Peniche?

07:28.073 --> 07:30.116
- I want to be
a detective, sir!

07:30.158 --> 07:31.618
[both panting]

07:31.659 --> 07:34.329
- Then be one,
you son of a bitch.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.247
[chuckles]

07:36.289 --> 07:38.333
- We became fast friends.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.461
Alex personally hired
every employee

07:41.503 --> 07:42.962
of theirs in the vista,

07:43.004 --> 07:46.675
each one a lost soul
running from their past.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.718
We had Edwin,
a glass cutter from Honduras

07:48.760 --> 07:50.387
heading concierge.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.514
[radio clicks]
[speaking Spanish]

07:53.848 --> 07:56.601
Patricia,
a runaway nun from Tampico

07:56.643 --> 07:58.186
on my security team.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.605
Abigail, an actual fugitive
from Puerto Rico,

08:00.647 --> 08:02.357
chief landscaper.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.775
She was arrested for stealing

08:03.817 --> 08:05.902
and then crashing
the governor's helicopter.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.737
But most dear to me was Luna,

08:07.779 --> 08:09.656
who lost her family
in a car accident.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.032
She became my sister.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.243
So then began
what vacationers referred to

08:13.284 --> 08:15.203
as the sandcastle days.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.331
And whatever sprung from
the odd garden of Alex's mind

08:18.373 --> 08:21.167
found its way into the fabric
of the Oceana Vista.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.460
- [laughs]
Ah!

08:22.502 --> 08:26.006
[phone ringing]

08:26.047 --> 08:27.799
- He used to call me at dawn

08:27.841 --> 08:30.844
and leave me messages
about dreams he had.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.929
- We were singing
"Happy Birthday" in my dream.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.848
And before it was over,
I saw that your head

08:34.889 --> 08:36.599
was a crumpled
piece of paper, man!

08:36.641 --> 08:38.935
What the hell
do you think that means?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.270
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

08:40.311 --> 08:41.855
- I did not mention
my past as a Frías,

08:41.896 --> 08:43.565
and he didn't ask.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.858
He always looked ahead.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.569
[fireworks booming]
all: Whoa!

08:47.610 --> 08:49.654
- Aww.

08:51.781 --> 08:55.285
- Alex wanted to create
memories for our guests,

08:55.326 --> 08:58.580
but in doing so, he created
a home for his employees.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.749
- [farts]
- Oh, what the fuck, Alex?

09:00.790 --> 09:02.542
He just farted here.
- [laughs]

09:02.584 --> 09:04.127
- The fuck is wrong with you?

09:04.169 --> 09:05.378
- [speaking Spanish]

09:05.420 --> 09:07.422
- But are we made
only of memories?

09:07.464 --> 09:10.342
all: Oceana Vista!

09:10.383 --> 09:11.593
- Whoo!
- Let's see.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.763
[applause]

09:17.349 --> 09:19.768
I fucked it up.
All right, one more time.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.561
- Okay.
- Ah!

09:21.603 --> 09:25.648
All right, tres, dos, uno!

09:25.690 --> 09:27.567
all: Oceana Vista!

09:27.609 --> 09:28.943
[camera shutter snaps]

09:28.985 --> 09:30.320
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

09:30.362 --> 09:33.281
[applause]

09:37.827 --> 09:40.622
- Five years. Five.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.207
[together] Five!
- Whoo!

09:42.248 --> 09:45.085
- The Oceana Vista
is a manifestation

09:45.126 --> 09:48.546
of a dream, of a memory haven.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.215
Uh...

09:57.806 --> 09:59.891
I love, uh...

10:01.476 --> 10:02.977
The...

10:11.486 --> 10:14.447
[eerie music]

10:14.489 --> 10:21.371
* *

10:42.392 --> 10:44.144
[mumbling]

10:45.270 --> 10:47.105
[music stops]
- Are you okay, Alex?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.106
- Uh--

10:48.148 --> 10:51.443
- What?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.695
What?

10:58.783 --> 11:01.703
- Stop fucking looking at me!

11:07.208 --> 11:09.252
- Alex!

11:09.294 --> 11:12.213
[waves crashing]

11:23.099 --> 11:24.434
[sighs]

11:27.228 --> 11:30.106
How are you doing, my friend?

11:30.148 --> 11:31.816
- You ever feel like
something from the past

11:31.858 --> 11:34.736
is missing from the future?

11:39.908 --> 11:42.452
I have memory leakage.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.870
- Hmm, yeah.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.498
Sometimes I forget things, too.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.376
I found that writing notes
to myself helps a lot.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.836
Post-its.
- No, you don't understand.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.714
I have memory leakage.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.508
- Leakage?
- Yeah, from my ears.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.720
This is a condition called
Tempus Exhaurire.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.765
From my ears, from my ass...

12:07.435 --> 12:09.104
Everywhere.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.111
- I've never heard
of Tempus Ex--

12:16.152 --> 12:18.863
is that some kind of amnesia?

12:22.826 --> 12:25.036
- I want to show you something.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.289
[mellow music]

12:28.331 --> 12:30.458
* *

12:30.500 --> 12:33.795
It's my attempt to...

12:33.837 --> 12:36.548
preserve my memories.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.426
- What do you mean?

12:39.467 --> 12:42.762
- People, places--
all my memories documented.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.098
The hippocampus,
it's the brain's pantry.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.725
We need to keep it stocked.

12:46.766 --> 12:53.940
* *

12:54.441 --> 12:58.945
I'm beginning to lose the sense
of who I am, Baltasar.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.905
I need your help
to pick up the pieces.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.116
I don't trust anyone else.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.784
My appetite makes no sense.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.578
I have a primal hatred
of iguanas

13:06.619 --> 13:07.871
I just don't understand.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.832
And I'm--I just want
to be a kid again.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.960
And I...

13:14.002 --> 13:16.379
I don't remember my family.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.885
- Well, maybe we should
at least tell Luna?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.511
- No, it's just--

13:23.553 --> 13:25.138
no one will understand.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.725
- I do not understand, Alex.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.435
- You will someday, though.

13:32.687 --> 13:36.024
- I don't know.
Um...

13:36.066 --> 13:37.942
This is really fucked up.

13:37.984 --> 13:42.489
Maybe if we ask for help
or talk to a doctor

13:42.530 --> 13:46.743
or if you change your diet,
you know, take some medication.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.787
- I know you're a Frías.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.874
* *

13:52.916 --> 13:55.460
I knew the moment I met you.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.546
You have the fucking
bone structure of a Frías.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.466
And nobody wakes up
dressed like you.

14:01.508 --> 14:05.178
But then your brother Alonso
came to the resort

14:05.220 --> 14:07.263
offering me
the deal of the century

14:07.305 --> 14:10.225
on Frías-sewn uniforms
if I fired you.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.395
It was a shakedown.

14:14.938 --> 14:19.275
Ask me what I told him.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.860
- What did you say to him?

14:20.902 --> 14:23.405
- I told him
"Fuck the fuck off."

14:23.446 --> 14:26.658
* *

14:26.700 --> 14:28.410
No more secrets between us.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.870
We're all we have.
I need you.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.872
Right?

14:32.914 --> 14:35.041
- I'm--I'm here for you.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.420
- I'm sorry.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.758
- That's when I knew Alex's
condition would be a problem.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.927
The leak became a flood.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.595
It affected the resort.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.726
Renovations started,
but never finished.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.061
Bills went unpaid.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.563
He turned on the staff,

14:56.604 --> 15:00.400
accusing them of stealing
to him, lying to him.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.776
- Memory leakage.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.446
- Yeah, memory leakage.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.242
I never thought Alex
was capable of

15:09.284 --> 15:11.327
being a dangerous man, but...

15:13.830 --> 15:16.166
Then came the iguanas.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.389
- I had to honor
my friend's secret,

15:31.431 --> 15:33.933
but I was asking myself, why?

15:33.975 --> 15:36.770
[tense music]

15:36.811 --> 15:38.730
Over the course of that year,

15:38.772 --> 15:42.442
he retreated to his penthouse,
a recluse, unraveling,

15:42.484 --> 15:45.695
until it all wove together
on Christmas.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.829
[dramatic music playing
over radio]

15:54.871 --> 15:56.373
- [mumbles]

16:11.680 --> 16:14.099
[indistinct chatter]

16:14.140 --> 16:17.185
- I am a galactic
activation portal.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.020
Enter me.
[door handle clicking]

16:21.272 --> 16:22.565
- Are you okay, jefe?

16:22.607 --> 16:24.150
- A little disappointed.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.944
- Yeah? Late night?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.697
- I could have been.
I don't know.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.616
I'm having a real problem
figuring out...

16:31.658 --> 16:32.826
- What happened
to your hands, man?

16:32.867 --> 16:34.452
- When.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.079
- Yeah, we need to get
you out of here, okay?

16:36.121 --> 16:37.914
- Do you need some help?
- Fuck. Yeah.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.166
- There you go.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.501
So I've been thinking--

16:41.543 --> 16:44.004
I thought forever it was,
like--

16:44.045 --> 16:45.296
- Yeah.
We need to wash these hands.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.465
- But then I was like, it's--
- Yeah, yeah.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.093
- But now I'm like--
[hissing]

16:50.135 --> 16:51.761
- All good, man.
All good.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.138
- What the hell?
Is it Christmas?

16:53.179 --> 16:54.222
- Yeah, it was yesterday.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.432
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.725
- Okay.

16:56.766 --> 17:00.687
- Um, listen, we need
to address the iguanas.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.565
It's beginning
to disturb the staff.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.984
- I guess it sounds nuts,
but I think I was killed

17:06.026 --> 17:08.153
by a fucking dinosaur
in my past life.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.821
- Really?
That's very interesting.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.322
- What the hell?
- This way.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.866
- Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.

17:12.907 --> 17:15.785
Question, if this hurricane
does change its course,

17:15.827 --> 17:18.872
is that something that you
have safety protocols for?

17:18.913 --> 17:21.708
- Uh, it's highly unlikely
to occur,

17:21.750 --> 17:23.293
but yes, we have a shelter

17:23.335 --> 17:24.544
being prepared
in case we need it.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.628
- You'll need it.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.131
That hurricane is headed
straight for us.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.009
Mm-kay.
[elevator pad beeps]

17:37.891 --> 17:39.893
- I wanted to help my friend,

17:39.934 --> 17:43.313
but a security matter required
my immediate attention.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.565
I'm Detective Baltasar Peniche.
[knocks]

17:46.900 --> 17:47.984
Good morning, sir.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.736
I am Detective
Baltasar Peniche,

17:49.778 --> 17:50.945
head of security.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.280
I'm here to help you
find your son.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.366
- Yes, yes.
- Is that Sam?

17:54.407 --> 17:55.909
Who is that?
- No, no.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.328
It's a security guy.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.913
- It was my biggest case.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.707
I'd only dealt with petty
theft and marital disputes,

18:02.749 --> 18:03.958
never a missing person.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.460
- God's sake.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.838
- Do you happen to have a photo
of Sam that I can see?

18:08.880 --> 18:11.007
- Uh, yeah, I may have one.
Let me just check.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.051
- Where's his passport?
- Yeah.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.803
- You know,
I don't have one on me,

18:14.844 --> 18:17.222
but, um, I could describe him.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.807
- Yes, please.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.308
- Well, he's very handsome.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.559
- That's not
what he's looking for.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.061
- No, no, that--
that--that works.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.688
That's very helpful.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.356
He is--he's attractive.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.191
- Do we need to
call the police?

18:28.233 --> 18:29.901
- No, Jan.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.487
He's probably just dicking
around somewhere, right?

18:32.529 --> 18:34.864
I mean, you must deal with this
kind of thing all the time.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.283
- Well, um,

18:37.325 --> 18:39.744
I promise I will find him, hm?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.871
- I'm going to call him again.
- Yeah.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.123
80 bucks a month,

18:43.164 --> 18:44.874
he should answer
the darn phone.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.418
- Yeah, it went to message.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.211
- Come on, Sammy.
Come on.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.547
- Sam, we got you this phone

18:50.588 --> 18:53.216
so you'd answer it
when we call you.

18:53.258 --> 18:56.261
So, uh, call me.

18:57.429 --> 18:59.723
You can talk to us.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.267
Uh, this is Dad.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.936
- What do you mean by that?
Hm?

19:04.978 --> 19:08.398
What do you mean when you say,
"You can talk to us"?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.316
- Nothing.
We're his parents.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.901
He can--he can talk to us.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.403
both: Don't lie to us, Carl.

19:13.445 --> 19:17.574
- I caught him looking
at a picture of a penis

19:17.615 --> 19:19.951
on the way over on the plane.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.037
- What?
How do you know?

19:22.078 --> 19:23.747
- I know what a penis
looks like, Jan.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.248
Someone texted it to him.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.084
- What?
both: Hey.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.878
- Uh, any luck?

19:29.919 --> 19:32.422
- Uh, no, he's not
anywhere by the beach

19:32.464 --> 19:34.174
or anywhere around the pool.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.800
- Excuse me, señorita,
can I ask you

19:35.842 --> 19:37.677
for a photo of Sam
that I can see?

19:37.719 --> 19:38.678
- Yeah.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.933
- Was that photo of his own
penis or someone else's penis?

19:43.975 --> 19:45.477
- Oh, my God!

19:45.518 --> 19:47.270
- Well, I don't know.
It could have been Sam's.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.271
It could have been
someone else's.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.773
I don't know what's worse.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.816
I don't know which
I'd rather it be.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.610
It might have been
a little small.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.363
- Oh.
- Maybe a little big for Sam.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.324
[laughs]
I--um...

19:59.366 --> 20:01.493
oh, I don't know.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.870
- Just stop.
- What do you think?

20:03.912 --> 20:07.082
- Hmm?
- Were you two having problems?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.625
- No.
- No?

20:08.667 --> 20:09.584
- No. God, no.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.211
No, we've been
together forever.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.171
And I'm here on vacation
with his family.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.506
And, you know,
we're always talking

20:14.547 --> 20:16.341
about marriage, you know?

20:16.383 --> 20:17.634
He's saying,
"I want to marry you."

20:17.676 --> 20:19.636
- And what do you say to him
about marriage?

20:19.678 --> 20:21.471
- Yeah, yeah--
no, yeah, I mean, it's--

20:21.513 --> 20:22.555
well, 'cause we have
a lot of time.

20:22.597 --> 20:23.807
We're young.
But we've been together--

20:23.848 --> 20:25.308
it's like, it could--

20:25.350 --> 20:27.227
I don't know what you guys
are staring at.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.398
- What are you thinking?

20:31.439 --> 20:35.443
- I was surprised when
I saw it on his phone, okay?

20:35.485 --> 20:37.320
I was surprised.
I didn't immediately go,

20:37.362 --> 20:39.030
"Jan, look, a penis."
- Don't lie to me.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.241
- Maybe the penis was,
like, an art channel.

20:41.282 --> 20:44.160
- Is this your--your son?

20:44.202 --> 20:46.413
- Sí.
- Yeah.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.748
- Can I keep this?

20:48.790 --> 20:50.709
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.739
- [exhales heavily]

23:12.934 --> 23:16.229
- Oh.
Hello again, Mr. Thompson.

23:16.271 --> 23:19.274
I am Detective
Baltasar Peniche,

23:19.315 --> 23:20.942
Oceana Vista head of security.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.318
- Oh.
- Can I come in?

23:22.360 --> 23:24.112
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

23:24.154 --> 23:26.156
Did you enjoy the mezcal?

23:26.197 --> 23:27.949
- Uh, well, I finished it.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.576
- Ah.

23:29.617 --> 23:33.580
Listen, I was wondering if
I could speak to your daughter?

23:33.621 --> 23:37.250
- Um, what is this about?

23:37.292 --> 23:39.502
- Another guest is trying
to locate their son,

23:39.544 --> 23:42.213
and your daughter
was the last person...

23:42.255 --> 23:43.131
- Hey, Vi?
[knocking on door]

23:43.173 --> 23:44.132
- He was seen with.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.759
[foreboding music]

23:45.800 --> 23:47.635
- Oh.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.137
Oh, no.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.766
Where is she?

23:52.807 --> 23:56.269
* *

23:56.311 --> 23:58.146
[keypad beeps, door clicks]

24:04.027 --> 24:05.612
- Alex?

24:07.655 --> 24:09.157
[grimaces]

24:09.908 --> 24:11.493
Alex?

24:19.584 --> 24:21.211
- Ah, fuck.

24:21.252 --> 24:27.175
* *

24:27.217 --> 24:29.344
Just emptying out what's left.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.599
[scoffs]

24:42.190 --> 24:44.025
- What is "pasaje"?

24:44.067 --> 24:46.194
- That one's important.

24:46.236 --> 24:47.445
I don't know why,

24:47.487 --> 24:49.197
but it must have been
important once

24:49.239 --> 24:51.032
'cause it's right there.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.661
This fucking thing.

24:54.703 --> 24:57.122
I'm thinking this mural
is actually more

24:57.163 --> 25:00.667
about the Oceana Vista's
memory, right?

25:00.709 --> 25:03.378
Not just my memory,
but the Oceana Vista's memory.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.505
- Two kids are missing.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.757
And you were the last one
to see them.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.136
- What?

25:11.177 --> 25:14.723
- They came to your room
last night.

25:14.764 --> 25:16.307
- No.
- Yes.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.810
- No.
That's not right.

25:20.228 --> 25:21.438
Wait, what?

25:21.479 --> 25:25.233
- What do you remember
from last night?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.694
- Uh, last night.

25:27.736 --> 25:30.822
You're really torturing me
with a question like that.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.451
What the fuck?

25:34.492 --> 25:36.828
Uh...

25:36.870 --> 25:38.621
We went dancing.
- Uh-huh.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.498
- It was the Christmas party.
- Yes.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.875
- Gotcha.
- What else?

25:41.916 --> 25:43.501
- Soy pasaje.
What?

25:43.543 --> 25:45.420
- Hey, Alex.
- What?

25:45.462 --> 25:47.380
- What do you remember?
- I don't know.

25:47.422 --> 25:48.381
- You don't know.
- What do you remember?

25:48.423 --> 25:52.385
- Okay.
Uh, okay, who is this?

25:52.427 --> 25:53.678
- Luna.
- Uh-huh.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.598
And this?
- Some guy with a hat?

25:56.639 --> 25:57.682
- Yeah, I guess.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.225
Um, who is this?

25:59.267 --> 26:01.394
- Oliver.
- And this?

26:01.436 --> 26:04.272
- That's you, dummy.
- Yeah, who am I?

26:05.482 --> 26:08.026
- Baltasar Peniche Frías,

26:08.068 --> 26:11.571
head of security
and my best friend.

26:12.447 --> 26:16.534
Everything is fine, man.
I'm really--I actually am okay.

26:20.872 --> 26:22.999
- Oh, man.

26:23.041 --> 26:26.753
Alex, who--who are these two?

26:28.713 --> 26:30.757
- That, I don't know.
- You don't know.

26:30.799 --> 26:34.177
What--what were you doing
in your car this morning?

26:34.219 --> 26:36.888
Because you had blood
on your hands.

26:36.930 --> 26:38.640
Where were you coming from?

26:40.225 --> 26:42.102
You don't know?
- I don't know.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.186
- Mm-hmm.

26:43.228 --> 26:46.564
* *

26:46.606 --> 26:49.109
Hey, look at me and listen.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.486
Yeah, these two
were at the party.

26:51.528 --> 26:53.238
And you had an altercation
with them.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.364
- No.
- Yes.

26:54.406 --> 26:56.116
And then they ran
into your elevator

26:56.157 --> 26:57.450
and got off on your floor.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.452
And five minutes after that,
you did the same.

26:59.494 --> 27:04.207
So I need you to tell me
what happened next, please.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.463
- I'm calling bullshit.

27:10.505 --> 27:12.424
This is a fuck hunt.
- Fuck off.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.010
[indistinct muttering]

27:15.051 --> 27:17.554
What did you do, Alex?

27:17.595 --> 27:19.305
What did you do?
- What did I do?

27:19.347 --> 27:20.682
- I don't know.
What did you do?

27:20.724 --> 27:22.642
- Well, what did I do?
Tell me what the fuck I did!

27:22.684 --> 27:23.852
I'm telling you
I don't remember!

27:23.893 --> 27:25.353
- Try to remember something,
please.

27:25.395 --> 27:26.563
Because if you put them there,

27:26.604 --> 27:28.023
there must be something
up there--

27:28.064 --> 27:29.274
- There's nothing in here, man!
- Okay, try to remember.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.442
- It's empty!

27:30.483 --> 27:33.945
[tense music]

27:33.987 --> 27:35.530
Jesus!

27:37.073 --> 27:39.200
- What did you do, Alex?

27:41.661 --> 27:44.748
[skateboard wheels rattle]

27:49.002 --> 27:53.214
Wait, where--
where did you get that?

27:56.676 --> 27:58.720
- I've had this
since I was a kid.

27:58.762 --> 28:01.222
- No, you haven't.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.854
This is Sam's.
The missing boy.

28:07.896 --> 28:10.398
- Look the other way
one last time.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.359
You and me, this resort--

28:12.400 --> 28:14.611
this is the family
we always wanted, right?

28:14.652 --> 28:16.071
Right?

28:16.112 --> 28:17.238
The hurricane's gonna come.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.948
Everyone's gonna forget
about this.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.117
This never even happened.

28:21.159 --> 28:23.578
Come on, B.

28:26.873 --> 28:29.417
[liquor pouring]
This isn't the end.

28:30.585 --> 28:32.921
The second half
is a heartbreaker, man.

28:34.172 --> 28:36.299
Come on.

29:27.475 --> 29:30.437

or the beginning?

Alex!

31:21.506 --> 31:22.966
Alex!

31:32.475 --> 31:33.893
The next morning,

31:33.935 --> 31:36.855
before the police
could even get involved,

31:36.896 --> 31:39.774
the hurricane changed
its course,

31:39.816 --> 31:42.110
just as Alex said it would.

31:47.323 --> 31:49.492
- My sweet friend,
I can see your face,

31:49.534 --> 31:51.453
but I can't remember
your name.

31:51.494 --> 31:56.291
- * But thanks
for your time *

31:56.332 --> 32:00.754
* Then you can thank me
for mine *

32:00.795 --> 32:03.298
- Seems like we're finally
at the end of the line.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.175
I got to say it sucks.

32:05.216 --> 32:08.470
- * That's said,
forget it *

32:08.511 --> 32:12.098
- My mind, my memory,
it's just an empty space,

32:12.140 --> 32:15.310
where I find myself
completely alone.

32:15.352 --> 32:18.855
- * No reason why you should
stay here lying to me *

32:18.897 --> 32:20.565
- Alone and afraid
that I can't remember

32:20.607 --> 32:23.526
any of the things you were
afraid I might have done.

32:23.568 --> 32:25.403
- * Don't say anymore,
just walk out the door *

32:25.445 --> 32:29.491
- You asked me if I remembered
the kids in my room.

32:29.532 --> 32:31.701
I tried to remember
myself as a kid

32:31.743 --> 32:34.079
falling in love
for the first time.

32:34.120 --> 32:38.124
But, um,
I can't remember a thing.

32:38.166 --> 32:41.628
- * Then you can thank me
for mine *

32:41.670 --> 32:43.213
- So if I can't remember love,

32:43.254 --> 32:45.548
then what's the point?

32:45.590 --> 32:49.969
- * That's said,
forget it *

32:50.011 --> 32:53.556
* *

32:53.598 --> 32:56.309
* If there was a word,
but magic's absurd *

32:56.351 --> 33:00.313
* I'd make
one dream come true *

33:00.355 --> 33:02.065
- Whatever did happen
last night,

33:02.107 --> 33:05.235
I hope that either everyone
can forgive me...

33:05.276 --> 33:07.487
- * But don't ever doubt
how I felt... *

33:07.529 --> 33:09.614
- Or forget me.

33:09.656 --> 33:10.990
- * About you *

33:11.032 --> 33:13.993
* *

33:14.035 --> 33:18.248
- * But thanks
for your time *

33:18.289 --> 33:19.833
* Then you can... *

33:19.874 --> 33:23.712
- Have you ever seen
the green ray?

33:23.753 --> 33:26.339
It's the first ray
of the rising sun.

33:26.381 --> 33:27.966
[thunder rumbles]

would be gone by now.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.934
[thunder rumbles]

34:25.523 --> 34:29.110
- I have nowhere to go.

34:29.152 --> 34:31.112
- Me neither.

34:31.654 --> 34:33.281
- Me neither.

[uneasy music]

34:57.263 --> 35:04.187

35:12.487 --> 35:13.947
- After the hurricane,

35:13.988 --> 35:16.866
the police
finally investigated.

35:16.908 --> 35:19.244
But by that moment,

35:19.285 --> 35:22.539
any real evidence
was destroyed.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.624
They found the skateboard.

35:24.666 --> 35:27.961
Well, it led to nothing.

35:28.003 --> 35:29.879
My mother Beatriz
got involved,

35:29.921 --> 35:34.592
and I never said
a word about Alex.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.597
They would never understand.

35:41.349 --> 35:44.436
Then I came back to El Caracol
to be a Frías again,

35:44.477 --> 35:49.107
but that place never
felt like home.

35:50.984 --> 35:53.903
Maybe we are not meant
to have one, hmm?

35:55.488 --> 35:57.532
The sad truth is that

35:57.574 --> 36:01.745
if you cut the head off
an iguana,

36:01.786 --> 36:03.371
it will die.

36:05.707 --> 36:08.710
- [laughs]
Okay.

36:08.752 --> 36:13.006
So--so you lied to the police,

36:13.048 --> 36:14.758
to the--
- The parents.

36:14.799 --> 36:19.220
- The parents, to everyone,
to protect a guy who said

36:19.262 --> 36:23.266
that his memory was leaking
out of his fucking ears?

36:23.308 --> 36:26.269
Come on!
- This is a crime scene.

36:26.311 --> 36:28.521
- Oh, this is something, yes.
- This is all a crime scene.

36:28.563 --> 36:30.148
- Wait, wait, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, listen.

36:30.190 --> 36:33.109
I'm almost, almost done, yes?

36:35.653 --> 36:38.990
I spent a year

36:39.032 --> 36:43.578
studying this mural,
looking for a clue.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.747
- Just emptying out
what's left.

36:45.789 --> 36:49.042
[gentle music]

36:49.084 --> 36:52.379
- I could tell he wasn't there.

36:52.420 --> 36:55.131
He was lost
in a different time.

36:55.173 --> 36:58.093
I saw his memory drain.

36:58.134 --> 37:01.304
But maybe this was different.

37:01.346 --> 37:05.725
Maybe this was the memory
of the Oceana Vista

37:05.767 --> 37:08.728
or maybe something else.

37:08.770 --> 37:12.315
[sighs]
But no.

37:12.357 --> 37:15.318
This was not the work
of a man

37:15.360 --> 37:19.781
with any profound insight
into the human condition.

37:19.823 --> 37:23.743
These was
the meaningless scribbles

37:23.785 --> 37:27.580
of a crazy person.

37:27.622 --> 37:30.166
So I made a mistake.

37:31.835 --> 37:36.673
I was looking for an answer
where there was none.

37:40.468 --> 37:43.596
But today,

37:43.638 --> 37:46.057
I realize...

37:52.522 --> 37:53.857
I was wrong.
