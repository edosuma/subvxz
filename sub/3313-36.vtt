00:07.088 --> 00:08.008
PREVIOUSLY ON
"MELISSA AND JOEY"...

00:08.009 --> 00:09.299
HEY, MARCO.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.131
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
MY BOYFRIEND, ZANDER.

00:11.132 --> 00:13.433
IF THIS IS ABOUT ME AND
LENNOX, TRUST ME...

00:13.434 --> 00:15.635
NOTHING HAPPENED.

00:15.636 --> 00:18.808
JOE WOULD BE SO EMBARRASSED IF HE
KNEW YOU TOLD ME ALL OF HIS SECRETS.

00:18.809 --> 00:21.191
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS THAT JOE
HAS A 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

00:21.192 --> 00:23.064
HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT.

00:26.567 --> 00:27.647
A SECRET DAUGHTER?

00:27.648 --> 00:30.200
I FEEL GOOD NOW.
ALL RIGHT, AHEM.

00:30.201 --> 00:31.992
I'M READY TO DO MY VOWS NOW.

00:33.914 --> 00:36.616
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:36.617 --> 00:39.999
"JOE, AS WE START OUR
JOURNEY TOGETHER..."

00:40.000 --> 00:42.001
( stammering ) I...
I HAVE A DAUGHTER?

00:42.002 --> 00:43.753
WHAT... WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:43.754 --> 00:46.966
HONEY, I DIDN'T INTERRUPT
YOU WHEN YOU DID YOUR VOWS.

00:46.967 --> 00:48.668
YOU JUST TOLD ME I
HAVE A DAUGHTER!

00:48.669 --> 00:50.470
WITH... WITH WHO? WHERE IS SHE?

00:50.471 --> 00:52.472
NONE OF THIS DAUGHTER
STUFF'S IMPORTANT.

00:52.473 --> 00:54.134
OR EVEN TRUE.

00:54.135 --> 00:55.765
GO ON, MEL.

00:55.766 --> 00:57.097
EVERYONE WANTS TO
HEAR YOUR VOWS.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.348
HEY, MEL.

00:58.349 --> 00:59.889
I NEED SOME ANSWERS.

00:59.890 --> 01:02.563
JOE, NOW?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.485
JOSEPH, MY ADVICE...

01:05.486 --> 01:07.567
IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT
YOUR LIFE ON HOLD

01:07.568 --> 01:10.320
EVERY TIME THERE'S A REPORT
OF AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD,

01:10.321 --> 01:12.952
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.

01:12.953 --> 01:14.033
THANKS, DADDY.

01:14.034 --> 01:16.406
HAPPY TO HELP, PUMPKIN.
( mouths )

01:16.407 --> 01:18.698
AHEM.

01:18.699 --> 01:21.411
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME? I...
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

01:21.412 --> 01:24.043
OH, UH... WE'LL BE
BACK IN A JIFFY.

01:24.044 --> 01:25.625
UM, THIS WILL BE
THE PERFECT TIME

01:25.626 --> 01:27.297
TO ADMIRE THE WORK
OF OUR FLORIST.

01:27.298 --> 01:28.919
ISN'T GERMAINE FABULOUS?

THIS INFORMATION
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER

01:52.573 --> 01:54.113
WAS TOLD TO ME IN CONFIDENCE.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.785
I GET IT. YOU GAVE YOUR WORD.
YOU DON'T WANNA BREAK IT.

01:55.786 --> 01:57.116
WHO TOLD YOU?!

01:57.117 --> 01:58.408
CONFIDENCE MEANS I
CAN'T TELL YOU.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.699
AND PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.371
- ( door shuts )
- Theresa: OW!

02:01.372 --> 02:02.912
WHAT? I DIDN'T
TELL HIM ANYTHING.

02:02.913 --> 02:05.205
- THERESA, COME HERE.
- ( sighs ) LOOK...

02:05.206 --> 02:06.876
ALL RIGHT, SPILL IT.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.338
I CAN'T. I JUST CAN'T.

02:08.339 --> 02:09.879
OKAY, FINE. THAT'S THE
WAY YOU WANNA PLAY IT,

02:09.880 --> 02:11.341
THEN I MIGHT JUST HAVE TO
TELL MOM A LITTLE STORY

02:11.342 --> 02:13.303
ABOUT HER BELOVED CAT WHO
SHE THOUGHT RAN AWAY,

02:13.304 --> 02:15.925
BUT ACTUALLY ENDED UP IN THE
TIRE TREADS OF YOUR MINIVAN.

02:15.926 --> 02:17.637
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO ONE NEEDS
TO KNOW ABOUT MR. WHISKERS.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.309
YEAH, AND NOBODY WILL
IF YOU COOPERATE.

02:19.310 --> 02:20.310
CAPISCE?

02:20.311 --> 02:22.312
OKAY.

02:22.313 --> 02:24.724
REMEMBER THAT NEW YEAR'S
AFTER YOU GRADUATED

02:24.725 --> 02:26.025
WHEN YOU CAME HOME TO VISIT

02:26.026 --> 02:27.066
AND YOU RECONNECTED
WITH YOU-KNOW-WHO

02:27.067 --> 02:28.068
FROM DOWN THE STREET?

02:32.943 --> 02:34.945
- FELICIA?
- FELICIA.

02:36.947 --> 02:39.118
- FELICIA.
- SO GOOD, IT'S HOT FELICIA.

02:39.119 --> 02:40.911
NOW WE KNOW. OKAY,
LET'S GO GET MARRIED.

02:42.333 --> 02:44.163
DON'T ANYBODY GO FAR!

02:44.164 --> 02:46.706
MARCO, GO STAND BY THE EXIT.

02:46.707 --> 02:48.047
NOBODY GETS OUT.

02:48.048 --> 02:49.749
I DON'T CARE WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THERE,

02:49.750 --> 02:51.921
THIS WEDDING IS HAPPENING TODAY!

02:51.922 --> 02:53.343
YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT?

02:53.344 --> 02:54.844
ABSOLUTELY.

02:54.845 --> 02:57.097
WELL, I WOULDN'T
PUT MONEY ON IT.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.099
HEY, LEN, SINCE WE HAVE
SOME DOWNTIME HERE,

03:00.100 --> 03:02.011
I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE
YOU COULD CAPTION

03:02.012 --> 03:04.684
SOME OF THESE PHOTOS I
FOUND ON MARCO'S PHONE.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.106
- WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
- OH, HE ASKED ME TO HOLD IT FOR HIM.

03:07.107 --> 03:08.978
I'M GUESSING TO MAKE SURE
I SEE THE HIGHLIGHTS

03:08.979 --> 03:10.401
FROM YOUR TRIP TO JERSEY.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.195
OOH!

03:16.196 --> 03:18.028
YEAH, THAT ONE WAS
MY FAVORITE TOO.

03:19.990 --> 03:21.871
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME
THAT I HAVE A DAUGHTER?!

03:21.872 --> 03:22.912
YOU NEVER ASKED?

03:22.913 --> 03:25.084
ARE YOU ALMOST DONE?

03:25.085 --> 03:26.916
BECAUSE THERE'S A
BUNCH OF PEOPLE

03:26.917 --> 03:28.958
OUT THERE WAITING FOR A WEDDING.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.460
MOM, HOW CAN YOU BE SO CALM?

03:30.461 --> 03:32.041
YOU JUST FOUND OUT YOU HAVE
A BRAND-NEW GRANDDAUGHTER.

03:32.042 --> 03:34.043
SWEETHEART, ONE
CRISIS AT A TIME.

03:34.044 --> 03:38.177
LET'S GET YOU MARRIED, AND
MAKE THIS CHILD LEGITIMATE.

03:38.178 --> 03:39.929
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS!

03:39.930 --> 03:42.262
WHY DIDN'T FELICIA TELL ME?

03:42.263 --> 03:44.103
I DON'T KNOW. YOU'LL
HAVE TO ASK HER.

03:44.104 --> 03:46.185
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T. SHE NEVER
WANTS TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

03:46.186 --> 03:49.189
OH, FELICIA MANCINI?

03:50.851 --> 03:52.272
SHE WAS HOT STUFF.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.023
- EXCUSE ME?
- OH, HONEY...

03:54.024 --> 03:56.657
AFTER A BABY, SHE'S
PROBABLY LIKE THIS.

03:58.118 --> 04:00.119
SO WHERE IS FELICIA NOW?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.492
SHE MOVED TO FORT WAYNE
TO RAISE THE GIRL.

04:02.493 --> 04:03.913
THE DAUGHTER'S NAME IS DANI.

04:03.914 --> 04:05.705
DANI?

04:05.706 --> 04:07.126
MY DAUGHTER'S NAME IS DANI.

04:07.127 --> 04:09.289
- YEAH.
- 13 YEARS...

04:09.290 --> 04:11.080
I MISSED OUT ON EVERYTHING.

04:11.081 --> 04:12.672
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:12.673 --> 04:14.674
I BET THAT I CAN FIND HER.

04:14.675 --> 04:16.796
HOLD ON A SEC. HEY, DARLING...
GOOD NEWS.

04:16.797 --> 04:19.339
ONE OF THE GIRLS FROM QANTAS SAYS
I CAN STAY AT HER PLACE TONIGHT,

04:19.340 --> 04:22.051
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT GETTING ME A HOTEL ROOM.

04:22.052 --> 04:23.683
WOW.

04:23.684 --> 04:25.305
YOU ALWAYS THINK OF
OTHERS, DON'T YOU, DADDY?

04:25.306 --> 04:26.726
YES, I DO!

04:26.727 --> 04:28.227
HASH IT OUT, LOVEBIRDS.

04:28.228 --> 04:30.350
JOE, LOOK...

04:30.351 --> 04:32.732
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT TO TAKE IN,

04:32.733 --> 04:34.694
BUT I HAVE BEEN ON A JUICE
FAST FOR A WEEK NOW,

04:34.695 --> 04:36.696
SO IF WE DON'T GET MARRIED
IN THE NEXT HALF-HOUR,

04:36.697 --> 04:37.857
I'M GONNA PASS OUT.

04:37.858 --> 04:39.699
AND I PASSED THE
CAKE ON MY WAY IN...

04:39.700 --> 04:41.901
( voice breaking )
AND IT TALKED TO ME.

04:41.902 --> 04:43.493
MEL, I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST FOUND
OUT THAT I HAVE A DAUGHTER...

04:43.494 --> 04:45.244
OH, MY GOD! HERE'S THE LINK.
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:45.245 --> 04:47.457
"DANNY MANCINI,
PROUD DOCK WORKER,

04:47.458 --> 04:50.710
DIED AGE 84." THAT
MIGHT NOT BE HER.

04:50.711 --> 04:52.041
HEY, ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.333
EVERYBODY'S WONDERING
WHAT'S GOING ON.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.415
YOU JUST WALKED AWAY
FROM ME, LENNOX.

04:55.416 --> 04:57.677
BECAUSE SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT
IS GOING ON IN HERE.

04:57.678 --> 04:59.879
WELL, I THINK SOMETHING PRETTY
SIGNIFICANT IS HAPPENING HERE TOO,

04:59.880 --> 05:01.180
'CAUSE YOU WERE MAKING
OUT WITH MARCO.

05:01.181 --> 05:03.683
UH, WHILE YOU AND I
WERE ON A PAUSE!

05:03.684 --> 05:06.386
ON A PAUSE FROM THE
TRUTH APPARENTLY.

05:06.387 --> 05:08.978
COULD YOU GUYS TAKE THIS MAYBE,
OH, I DON'T KNOW, ANYPLACE ELSE?!

05:08.979 --> 05:10.351
KNOCK-KNOCK.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.192
JUST SO YOU KNOW...

05:13.193 --> 05:15.024
UNCLE EDDIE GOT
INTO THE CHAMPAGNE

05:15.025 --> 05:16.275
AND LET THE DOVES LOOSE.

05:16.276 --> 05:18.067
- MY DOVES!
- DON'T WORRY.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.940
I'M LURING THEM BACK INTO
THE CAGES WITH CRAB CAKES.

05:20.941 --> 05:23.072
MY CRAB CAKES!

05:23.073 --> 05:25.365
HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.326
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'D DO WITHOUT HIM.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.948
WOULD YOU PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN,

05:28.949 --> 05:31.621
AND PLEASE MARRY THIS GIRL?!

05:31.622 --> 05:34.043
GIVE HIM SOME TIME.
LET HIM PROCESS THIS.

05:34.044 --> 05:36.626
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

05:36.627 --> 05:39.048
OKAY, ZANDER, IT WAS ONE...

05:39.049 --> 05:40.420
MAYBE TWO OR THREE KISSES.

05:40.421 --> 05:41.761
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

05:41.762 --> 05:43.553
THE BIG DEAL IS YOU TOLD
ME NOTHING HAPPENED.

05:43.554 --> 05:45.174
I CAN'T BE WITH SOMEONE
I CAN'T TRUST.

05:45.175 --> 05:46.886
YOU'RE LIVING WITH THOSE
GIRL ROOMMATES...

05:46.887 --> 05:50.470
DANCER JORDAN AND "I'M
ALLERGIC TO BRAS" CHRIS.

05:50.471 --> 05:52.101
HOW DO I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.603
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT TRUSTING ME ANYMORE.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.605
WE'RE DONE.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.027
WELL, THAT'S JUST PERFECT.

05:58.028 --> 05:59.689
NO TWITTER, NO FACEBOOK...

05:59.690 --> 06:01.360
I THOUGHT KIDS TODAY ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.903
YEAH, IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANNA
BE FOUND BY A STRANGE MAN.

06:03.904 --> 06:06.035
( knocks on door )

06:06.036 --> 06:08.117
HEY, GUYS. UM, IS
THIS A BAD TIME?

06:08.118 --> 06:09.158
Women: YES!

06:09.159 --> 06:10.580
OKAY, I'M GONNA
MAKE IT QUICK THEN.

06:10.581 --> 06:11.991
UH, MY PLANS FOR NEXT YEAR,

06:11.992 --> 06:13.122
THEY DO NOT INCLUDE COLLEGE.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.084
- OKAY, SEE YA.
- WHAT?! WAIT.

06:15.085 --> 06:16.255
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THIS?

06:16.256 --> 06:18.257
UM, A WHILE BACK.
AND, HEY, LISTEN,

06:18.258 --> 06:20.460
SINCE THIS WEDDING'S KIND OF
LIKE 50-50 AT THIS POINT,

06:20.461 --> 06:23.262
IS IT OKAY IF I HAVE
SOME OF THE CAKE?

06:23.263 --> 06:24.714
DON'T YOU DARE.

06:24.715 --> 06:26.345
NOBODY WILL NOTICE. I'LL
TAKE IT FROM THE BACK.

06:26.346 --> 06:28.347
OKAY, CAN'T YOU SEE THIS
IS NOT A GOOD TIME?

06:28.348 --> 06:30.930
I ONLY HAD ONE LUNCH TODAY!

06:30.931 --> 06:33.312
ALL RIGHT, DECISION TIME.

06:33.313 --> 06:36.356
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

06:38.018 --> 06:39.018
LET'S GET MARRIED.

06:39.019 --> 06:41.070
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, YEAH.

06:41.071 --> 06:43.232
I'LL, UH... I'LL PUT
MY GAME FACE ON

06:43.233 --> 06:44.403
AND JUST GET THROUGH IT.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.115
NO, JOE.

06:46.116 --> 06:48.077
WE CAN'T START THE REST
OF OUR LIVES LIKE THAT.

06:48.078 --> 06:49.909
YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR HEAD TOGETHER.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.832
WHY DON'T YOU CALL FELICIA
AND GET THE WHOLE STORY?

06:52.833 --> 06:54.834
I HAVE HER PHONE NUMBER. BUT
YOU DIDN'T GET IT FROM ME.

06:54.835 --> 06:56.666
I LOST MY PHONE
AND YOU FOUND IT.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.668
OH, HONEY. YOU DON'T
NEED AN ALIBI.

06:58.669 --> 07:02.462
HER FATHER'S IN THE RIVER.
HE CAN'T HURT US ANYMORE.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.463
WHAT ABOUT THE WEDDING?

07:03.464 --> 07:05.134
WE CAN GET MARRIED TOMORROW.

07:05.135 --> 07:07.176
SURE. EVERYBODY STAYS PUT,

07:07.177 --> 07:11.010
WE PUT THE SHRIMP ON ICE. NO
REASON THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.

07:11.011 --> 07:12.552
WON'T THIS PLACE
ALREADY BE BOOKED?

07:12.553 --> 07:14.143
NOT ON A MONDAY.

07:14.144 --> 07:16.395
WHAT IDIOT GETS
MARRIED ON A MONDAY?

07:16.396 --> 07:18.017
( laughs, gasps )

07:18.018 --> 07:19.399
MY TWO FAVORITE ONES.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.865
FELICIA, UH, HI. IT'S JOE AGAIN.

07:25.866 --> 07:28.828
UM, I REALLY NEED YOU
TO CALL ME BACK, OKAY?

07:28.829 --> 07:30.780
LOOK, MY NUMBER IS, UM...

07:30.781 --> 07:34.373
WELL, IT'S THE SAME AS IT WAS ON THE
OTHER 12 MESSAGES THAT I'VE LEFT YOU.

07:34.374 --> 07:36.375
SO... CALL ME BACK, PLEASE.

07:36.376 --> 07:37.667
THANKS, BYE.

07:37.668 --> 07:39.629
YOU KNOW, SHE MIGHT NOT
WANNA TALK TO YOU.

07:39.630 --> 07:41.841
WELL, SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO IF
I'M SITTING ON HER DOORSTEP.

07:41.842 --> 07:44.463
FORT WAYNE'S ONLY A TWO-HOUR DRIVE FROM
HERE. I'LL CALL YOU FROM THE ROAD.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.587
- WAIT.
- MEL, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO DO.

07:47.588 --> 07:49.549
I KNOW, THAT'S WHY
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.971
AW, HONEY.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.893
TO PREVENT ME FROM
FLYING OFF THE HANDLE?

07:53.894 --> 07:56.056
WELL, NOT JUST THAT.
BUT MOSTLY THAT.

08:03.273 --> 08:04.564
- ( deeply exhales )
- THAT'S GOOD, JOE.

08:04.565 --> 08:05.945
DEEP CALMING BREATHS.

08:05.946 --> 08:07.106
AND I WILL REMIND YOU ONCE AGAIN

08:07.107 --> 08:08.908
THAT FELICIA HOLDS
ALL THE CARDS HERE.

08:08.909 --> 08:10.489
YEAH? I HOLD SOME
OF THE CARDS TOO.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.992
ALL RIGHT? FOUR-OF-A-KIND,
AND THEY'RE ALL ME.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.535
SO YOU FEEL NO NEED TO
MAKE ANY SENSE RIGHT NOW?

08:15.786 --> 08:17.207
NO, I DO NOT.

08:19.459 --> 08:20.499
JOE.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.421
WHAT A SURPRISE.

08:22.422 --> 08:24.423
YEAH? LETTING ME FILL
YOUR VOICEMAIL UP

08:24.424 --> 08:26.215
DIDN'T TIP YOU OFF THAT
I MAY SHOW UP HERE?

08:26.216 --> 08:28.588
HI, I'M MEL. JOE'S FIANCEE.

08:28.589 --> 08:29.679
I WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE HIS WIFE BY NOW,

08:29.680 --> 08:32.091
BUT A LITTLE SOMETHING CAME UP.

08:32.092 --> 08:33.683
THE DAUGHTER THAT I
NEVER KNEW I HAD.

08:33.684 --> 08:35.474
UH-HUH.

08:35.475 --> 08:37.306
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN AND
LET ME GET YOU A GLASS

08:37.307 --> 08:39.899
OF MATCHA GREEN TEA BEFORE
YOU GET BACK ON THE ROAD?

08:39.900 --> 08:40.980
I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR TEA.

08:40.981 --> 08:41.982
- WE'D LOVE TO!
- I JUST...

08:44.194 --> 08:46.355
OH, I'M SO GLAD WE
CAUGHT YOU AT HOME.

08:46.356 --> 08:48.818
YOU ALMOST MISSED ME. I
LEAVE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.820
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU
TOUR WITH ROCK BANDS.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.111
ARE YOU A BACKUP SINGER?

08:52.112 --> 08:54.153
ACUPUNCTURIST. AGING ROCKERS...

08:54.154 --> 08:55.865
THEIR BACKS GO OUT ALL THE TIME.

08:55.866 --> 08:58.247
THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE. HOW DID
YOU GET IN THAT LINE OF WORK?

08:58.248 --> 08:59.248
- WELL...
- REALLY?

08:59.249 --> 09:01.791
SMALL-TALK NOW?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.793
- WHERE IS DANI?
- DANI?

09:03.794 --> 09:05.254
UH, DANI'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

09:05.255 --> 09:06.295
WHEN WILL SHE BE BACK?

09:06.296 --> 09:08.297
PFFT. TEENAGE GIRLS...

09:08.298 --> 09:11.550
WHO KNOWS? YOU CAN'T
MICROCHIP THEM.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.803
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME
THAT I HAVE A DAUGHTER?

09:13.804 --> 09:16.225
FELICIA, YOU HAVE SUCH
A COZY HOUSE HERE.

09:16.226 --> 09:17.807
AND LOOK AT ALL THESE BUDDHAS.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.599
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
SAY HE'S OVERWEIGHT.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.732
BUT I THINK HE IS JUST
COMFORTABLE WITH HIS OWN BODY,

09:22.733 --> 09:24.735
AND THAT IS TRULY ENLIGHTENED.

09:27.688 --> 09:29.278
SO WHAT'D YOU TELL
DANI ABOUT ME?

09:29.279 --> 09:31.821
JUST THAT HER BIO DAD
WAS AN OLD FRIEND

09:31.822 --> 09:34.193
WHO HELPED ME OUT BY
GETTING ME PREGNANT.

09:34.194 --> 09:35.655
"BIO DAD"?

09:35.656 --> 09:37.867
SO WHAT AM I, LIKE SOME
KIND OF A TEST TUBE NOW?

09:37.868 --> 09:39.578
WHY DON'T I GET THAT GREEN TEA?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.200
IT'S VERY CALMING.

09:41.201 --> 09:44.413
MAKE JOE'S A DOUBLE.
AND ADD SOME SCOTCH.

09:44.414 --> 09:46.836
FELICIA, WHEN AM I GONNA
GET TO MEET DANI?

09:46.837 --> 09:48.798
MAYBE WHEN SHE'S 18

09:48.799 --> 09:52.211
AND I CAN'T STOP HER,
YOU KNOW, LEGALLY.

09:52.212 --> 09:53.512
THAT'S NOT RIGHT, FELICIA.

09:53.513 --> 09:55.474
JOE, IT'S BEEN GREAT SEEING YOU.

09:55.475 --> 09:57.056
LOOK, I PUT THESE IN TO-GO CUPS.

09:57.057 --> 09:58.177
YOU CAN TAKE 'EM WITH YOU.

09:58.178 --> 10:00.640
AND PLEASE, RECYCLE.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.351
I AM NOT LEAVING HERE UNTIL
I MEET MY DAUGHTER...

10:02.352 --> 10:04.523
THIS HAS BEEN GREAT, BUT
WE'VE GOTTA GET GOING NOW.

10:04.524 --> 10:06.726
- NO, WE DON'T.
- ACTUALLY, WE DO.

10:06.727 --> 10:08.277
- MEL, LISTEN TO ME...
- JOE, NOW.

10:08.278 --> 10:09.488
I AM NOT LEAVING... I
AM NOT LEAVING, HONEY.

10:09.489 --> 10:11.230
OW! HEY!

10:11.231 --> 10:13.402
HEY, YOU JUST PINCHED MY ELBOW.

10:13.403 --> 10:16.155
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
WANNA SEE THIS.

10:16.156 --> 10:18.367
BAKE SALE?

10:18.368 --> 10:20.449
YOU THINK I NEED A
COOKIE RIGHT NOW?

10:20.450 --> 10:23.242
IT IS A COMMUNITY FUND-RAISER
AT DANI'S MIDDLE SCHOOL

10:23.243 --> 10:25.084
HAPPENING RIGHT
THIS VERY MINUTE.

10:25.085 --> 10:26.165
THAT'S WHERE SHE IS.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.417
OHH...

10:28.418 --> 10:30.209
SEE? OTHER PEOPLE HAVE IDEAS.

10:30.210 --> 10:31.300
I NEVER SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T.

10:31.301 --> 10:32.461
YOU IMPLIED IT WITH YOUR TONE.

10:32.462 --> 10:33.552
NO, IT'S JUST HOW YOU TOOK IT.

10:33.553 --> 10:34.553
NO.

10:34.554 --> 10:36.556
( overlapping arguing )

10:39.099 --> 10:41.100
WATCH THE TOP.

10:41.101 --> 10:42.521
WATCH THE TOP!

10:42.522 --> 10:44.143
WE'RE WATCHING THE TOP, MA!

10:44.144 --> 10:46.065
YOU KNOW, IF IT WOULD
HELP, I COULD JUST KINDA

10:46.066 --> 10:48.027
EAT THE TOP DOWN A
LITTLE BIT FOR YOU.

10:48.028 --> 10:51.110
NO, WE NEED YOUR APPETITE
FOR MORE IMPORTANT THINGS.

10:51.111 --> 10:54.193
BEFORE ALL THIS SPOILS,
SOMEBODY HAS TO EAT IT.

10:54.194 --> 10:57.486
START WITH THE DAIRY AND WORK
YOUR WAY UP TO THE MEATS.

10:57.487 --> 10:59.909
THAT'S A LOT OF FOOD, MA.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.081
I CAN DO IT.

11:03.203 --> 11:04.414
I WAS BORN FOR THIS JOB.

11:07.087 --> 11:10.089
OKAY, YOU DELIBERATELY SABOTAGED
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ZANDER.

11:10.090 --> 11:13.672
YOU NEED TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND ME WAS NOTHING.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.846
SO YOU WANT ME TO LIE TO HIM?

11:16.847 --> 11:20.059
NO! TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.011
AS I REMEMBER IT.

11:22.012 --> 11:24.603
I DON'T KNOW, LENNOX.

11:24.604 --> 11:27.566
IF WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US WAS
NOTHING, THEN NOBODY WOULD BE UPSET.

11:27.567 --> 11:31.110
AND I DON'T THINK THE NIP
SLIP THERE IN THE PHOTO BOOTH

11:31.111 --> 11:32.151
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

11:32.152 --> 11:34.653
THAT'S YOUR NIPPLE.

11:34.654 --> 11:37.487
DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY
LESS BEAUTIFUL.

11:39.489 --> 11:42.531
WOULD YOU BE DISPLEASED IF
I KISSED YOU RIGHT NOW?

11:42.532 --> 11:44.533
OH, MY GOD.

11:44.534 --> 11:47.828
JUST BEING WITH YOU REMINDS ME
OF WHAT A GREAT GUY ZANDER IS.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.213
ALL RIGHT, SO LOOK, MEL,
WHEN WE GET IN THERE,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.005
WE WILL SPLIT UP UNTIL
WE FIND DANI, ALL RIGHT?

11:56.006 --> 11:57.386
- IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD.
- OKAY.

11:57.387 --> 12:00.600
( girls chattering )

12:01.842 --> 12:03.552
THIS IS GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE.

12:03.553 --> 12:06.305
NO NO NO, WE'LL JUST GO TABLE
BY TABLE UNTIL WE FIND HER.

12:06.306 --> 12:07.516
NO, I MEANT STAYING
ON MY JUICE FAST

12:07.517 --> 12:09.308
WITH ALL THESE
GOODIES TAUNTING ME.

12:09.309 --> 12:11.941
OKAY, LOOK, WHEN WE FIND DANI,

12:11.942 --> 12:13.562
WE'VE GOTTA STICK TO
FELICIA'S STORY, OKAY?

12:13.563 --> 12:14.564
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.529
HELLO THERE, YOUNG LADY.

12:20.530 --> 12:23.122
WOW, LOOK AT ALL THESE
LOVELY THINGS YOU'VE BAKED.

12:23.123 --> 12:25.284
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD, HUH?
OOH.

12:25.285 --> 12:26.575
SO, UH, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

12:26.576 --> 12:27.957
WHY DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

12:27.958 --> 12:30.960
OH, I'M JUST, UH, YOU
KNOW, INTERESTED IN...

12:30.961 --> 12:32.872
YOUNG GIRLS AND THEIR NAMES.

12:32.873 --> 12:34.463
WHAT?

12:34.464 --> 12:36.175
IS THIS MAN BOTHERING
YOU, ERICA?

12:36.176 --> 12:37.336
ERICA, OF COURSE! YES.

12:37.337 --> 12:38.757
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ME. HEH.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.759
HAVE A NICE DAY.

12:43.433 --> 12:46.225
YOU KNOW THE BEST STUFF IN THIS
WHOLE BAKE SALE IS ON THIS TABLE.

12:46.226 --> 12:48.227
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY LOOK GREAT,

12:48.228 --> 12:50.149
BUT I'M KINDA ON
THIS JUICE FAST.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.981
YOU? BUT YOU'RE SO SKINNY.

12:51.982 --> 12:54.193
AND IT'S JUST ONE LITTLE COOKIE.

12:54.194 --> 12:56.065
- WELL, OKAY, FINE.
- CHEAPER IF YOU BUY THE WHOLE BAG.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.396
YEAH, I DON'T NEED
THE WHOLE BAG.

12:57.397 --> 13:00.029
OH, I GET IT. YOU'RE
SAVING ROOM FOR PIE.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.201
GOOD CALL. IT'S ONLY $7.

13:02.202 --> 13:03.742
- NO, THANKS.
- OH, I SEE.

13:03.743 --> 13:05.164
NOT YOUR FIRST BAKE SALE.

13:05.165 --> 13:07.536
TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL
GIVE YOU TWO FOR 10.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.667
REALLY, I'M FINE.

13:08.668 --> 13:10.329
I'LL THROW IN A BAG OF SCONES.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.671
WOW. DO YOU EVER QUIT?

13:12.672 --> 13:15.294
( sighs ) WAS I
COMING ON TOO STRONG?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.466
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M
A LITTLE PUSHY.

13:17.467 --> 13:19.219
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GET IT.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.844
OH, MY... JOE! JOE!

13:24.845 --> 13:28.477
I FOUND THE MOST
AMAZING COOKIE...

13:28.478 --> 13:31.021
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
MADE WITH YOUR BATTER.

13:35.605 --> 13:36.605
DANI?

13:36.606 --> 13:38.487
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

13:38.488 --> 13:40.699
( stammering ) I'M...
I'M ACTUALLY...

13:40.700 --> 13:43.072
AN OLD FRIEND OF YOUR MOM'S.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.743
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET YOU.

13:44.744 --> 13:45.945
WHY?

13:45.946 --> 13:47.947
WELL, UM...

13:47.948 --> 13:50.249
BECAUSE BACK WHEN I...
WHEN I KNEW YOUR MOM...

13:50.250 --> 13:51.290
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT?

13:51.291 --> 13:53.452
LIKE 14 YEARS AGO.

13:53.453 --> 13:57.086
SO, MY AGE PLUS...

13:57.087 --> 13:58.457
I DON'T KNOW, NINE MONTHS?

13:58.458 --> 13:59.548
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

13:59.549 --> 14:02.131
THEN THAT WOULD MAKE YOU...

14:02.132 --> 14:03.222
MY DAD?

14:03.223 --> 14:05.304
IT WOULD.

14:05.305 --> 14:06.926
THE SPERM DONOR.

14:06.927 --> 14:09.098
( exhales )

14:09.099 --> 14:11.520
THAT'S ME.

14:11.521 --> 14:12.892
THE GAY SPERM DONOR.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.814
- SAY WHAT?
- YEP, THAT'S HIM.

14:15.815 --> 14:17.396
MOM TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.

14:17.397 --> 14:19.068
YOU WERE A BACKUP
DANCER FOR MADONNA,

14:19.069 --> 14:20.649
AND IT WAS MOM'S FIRST TOUR.

14:20.650 --> 14:24.113
AND SHE ASKED YOU
TO DO HER A FAVOR.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.285
OKAY, I'M... I'M GONNA CLEAR
SOMETHING UP FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:26.286 --> 14:29.078
- ( chuckles )
- ( clears throat )

14:29.079 --> 14:32.161
MADONNA WAS A PLEASURE
TO WORK WITH.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.953
OH, MY GOSH! THIS IS SO AMAZING.

14:33.954 --> 14:36.085
I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF
IT WEREN'T FOR YOU.

14:36.086 --> 14:38.497
YOU WANT A FREE BAG OF
BLONDIES OR SOMETHING?

14:38.498 --> 14:41.090
YEAH, SURE. THAT WOULD BE NICE.

14:41.091 --> 14:43.092
OH, MY GOD! I HAVE
THE BEST IDEA.

14:43.093 --> 14:46.215
I SHOULD INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR
THEATER TEACHER, MR. ELLINGTON.

14:46.216 --> 14:48.807
HE'S REALLY CUTE AND HE JUST
BROKE UP WITH HIS BOYFRIEND,

14:48.808 --> 14:50.971
SO HE'S AVAILABLE.

14:53.513 --> 14:55.104
WE FOUND HER!

14:55.105 --> 14:57.106
SO, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

14:57.107 --> 14:58.897
I'M NOT SURE.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.110
I WAS AT THE ALTAR READY
TO MARRY MY BEST GIRL,

15:01.111 --> 15:04.113
AND A FEW HOURS LATER, THE
DAUGHTER I NEVER KNEW IS...

15:04.114 --> 15:07.406
ABOUT TO SET ME UP
ON A GAY BLIND DATE.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.447
RELAX.

15:08.448 --> 15:09.950
IT'S PROBABLY JUST COFFEE.

15:19.879 --> 15:21.710
THIS... THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

15:21.711 --> 15:24.803
OKAY? I CAME ALL THIS WAY AND DANI
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHO I REALLY AM.

15:24.804 --> 15:27.426
LOOK, FOR DANI'S SAKE, YOU HAVE
TO STICK WITH FELICIA'S STORY.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.218
( sighs )

15:29.219 --> 15:32.141
MR. ELLINGTON WILL BE
OVER IN JUST A SECOND.

15:32.142 --> 15:34.553
HE CHECKED YOU OUT AND WANTED
TO FRESHEN UP HIS HAIR GEL.

15:34.554 --> 15:36.765
THAT'S GREAT. LISTEN...

15:36.766 --> 15:38.607
DANI, IT'S BEEN SO
NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:38.608 --> 15:40.399
BUT I... I HAVE TO GO.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.061
- BUT I JUST MET YOU.
- I KNOW.

15:42.062 --> 15:43.322
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
IT'S JUST...

15:43.323 --> 15:45.234
MEL AND I ARE GETTING
MARRIED TOMORROW.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.406
- THIS MEL?
- MEL...

15:47.407 --> 15:49.408
VIN.

15:49.409 --> 15:52.241
MY, UM...

15:52.242 --> 15:54.073
MAN-BRIDE.

15:54.074 --> 15:57.876
SO TELL MR. ELLINGTON THAT JOE IS
FLATTERED, BUT HE IS SPOKEN FOR.

15:57.877 --> 16:00.459
WAIT. YOU GUYS ARE A
COUPLE, AREN'T YOU?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.630
YOU'RE THE ONES GETTING MARRIED.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.382
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T
BELIEVE ALL THESE YEARS

16:03.383 --> 16:04.463
MY MOM LIED.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.715
MY DAD'S STRAIGHT?

16:06.716 --> 16:09.259
WHAT AM I GONNA
TELL MY FRIENDS?!

16:13.513 --> 16:16.015
ZANDER? ARE YOU HOME?

16:16.016 --> 16:18.358
OH, BOY.

16:21.861 --> 16:24.233
HEY, I HOPE I'M NOT WAKING YOU,

16:24.234 --> 16:26.025
BUT... WELL, SINCE
I PROBABLY DID...

16:26.026 --> 16:29.528
UM, CAN WE TALK JUST A LITTLE?

16:29.529 --> 16:30.739
HEY, YOU.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.112
WHAT ARE YOU, UH... WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:33.113 --> 16:35.114
LOOK, I'M SORRY I CAME
OVER WITHOUT CALLING,

16:35.115 --> 16:37.166
BUT THIS WILL BE QUICK.

16:37.167 --> 16:39.958
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY
UP-FRONT WITH YOU ABOUT MARCO,

16:39.959 --> 16:41.500
BUT, YOU KNOW,

16:41.501 --> 16:44.123
MY LESS-THAN-HONESTY CAME
FROM A VERY GOOD PLACE.

16:44.124 --> 16:45.124
IT REALLY DID.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.715
YUH-HUH.

16:46.716 --> 16:48.467
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

16:48.468 --> 16:50.389
THE PAST TWO WEEKS THAT
WE'VE BEEN BACK TOGETHER

16:50.390 --> 16:52.301
HAVE BEEN AMAZING,

16:52.302 --> 16:53.432
AND I DIDN'T WANT THAT
TO GET ALL MESSED UP

16:53.433 --> 16:55.724
BY SOME STUPID KISS
IN A PHOTO BOOTH.

16:55.725 --> 16:57.846
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

16:57.847 --> 17:00.399
THAT MAKES SENSE, RIGHT?

17:00.400 --> 17:02.811
IT DOES.

17:02.812 --> 17:05.234
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

17:05.235 --> 17:07.236
AND I THINK WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT ALL THIS LATER.

17:07.237 --> 17:09.488
OH, OKAY, SO YOU FORGIVE ME?

17:09.489 --> 17:10.819
OF COURSE I DO.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.451
IT WOULD BE PETTY OF
ME NOT TO FORGIVE YOU

17:12.452 --> 17:14.243
FOR SOMETHING THAT
HAPPENED ONCE.

17:14.244 --> 17:15.324
BYE NOW, TALK SOON.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.286
ZANDER, WHOA, ZANDER.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.118
YOU'RE ACTING KINDA
WEIRD ABOUT THIS.

17:19.119 --> 17:22.421
WELL, I'M WEIRD WITH JOY.

17:22.422 --> 17:24.583
OKAY, WELL, LISTEN, I'M
GLAD WE WORKED THIS OUT

17:24.584 --> 17:25.584
AND WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

17:25.585 --> 17:26.965
YEAH, ME TOO.

17:26.966 --> 17:30.429
ZANDER, I WOKE UP AND
YOU WERE GONE, SO...

17:30.430 --> 17:33.762
- OH, HI, LEANNE.
- IT'S LENNOX.

17:33.763 --> 17:36.595
WOW, SORRY. UH, DIDN'T
REALIZE I WAS INTERRUPTING.

17:36.596 --> 17:38.227
OKAY, WAIT. I CAN EXPLAIN, OKAY?

17:38.228 --> 17:41.059
AFTER OUR BIG FIGHT, I
THOUGHT WE WERE OVER.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.102
AND I WAS FEELING
TERRIBLE, SO CHRIS,

17:43.103 --> 17:45.354
BEING A SUPPORTIVE ROOMMATE, WAS
JUST TRYING TO CHEER ME UP.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.775
OKAY.

17:46.776 --> 17:48.527
WELL, NEXT TIME YOU
BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE,

17:48.528 --> 17:50.529
YOU MIGHT WANNA WAIT,
I DON'T KNOW, UM...

17:50.530 --> 17:54.032
MAYBE AN HOUR BEFORE YOU JUMP IN
BED WITH THE NEXT WOMAN YOU SEE.

17:54.033 --> 17:57.035
OKAY, IN THE FUTURE. SO...

17:57.036 --> 17:58.407
NOW THAT WE KNOW THE
WHOLE STORY HERE...

17:58.408 --> 18:01.580
AND THERE ARE NO GOOD
GUYS OR BAD GUYS...

18:01.581 --> 18:02.701
WE CAN ALL GET PAST THIS.

18:02.702 --> 18:03.752
I'M ALREADY PAST IT.

18:03.753 --> 18:05.124
WH...

18:05.125 --> 18:06.125
GOOD-BYE, ZANDER.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.417
BUT, LENNOX...

18:10.670 --> 18:12.671
YEAH, GLORIA, WE FOUND HER.

18:12.672 --> 18:15.424
WELL, SHE'S PRETTY MUCH JUST
LIKE JOE, ONLY SHORTER.

18:15.425 --> 18:16.845
Dani: YOU LIED TO ME
ABOUT EVERYTHING!

18:16.846 --> 18:18.517
AND LOUDER.

18:18.518 --> 18:19.808
YEAH, THEY ARE GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

18:19.809 --> 18:21.140
AND I'M STAYING OUT
HERE ON THE PORCH

18:21.141 --> 18:22.641
WHERE IT'S SAFE.

18:22.642 --> 18:25.394
DANI, WOULD YOU JUST CALM DOWN?

18:25.395 --> 18:27.606
YOUR AURA, IT'S LIKE BRIGHT RED.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.778
PROBABLY BECAUSE I GREW
UP WITHOUT A FATHER

18:29.779 --> 18:31.990
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T BE
BOTHERED TO TELL ME THE TRUTH!

18:31.991 --> 18:33.822
HEY, IT'S NOT ALL MY FAULT.

18:33.823 --> 18:36.825
WELL, HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I EXISTED.

18:36.826 --> 18:38.827
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW...
- MOM, THIS IS CRAZY!

18:38.828 --> 18:39.998
LADIES, LADIES, LADIES,

18:39.999 --> 18:41.791
IF I CAN JUST
INTERJECT SOMETHING.

18:46.296 --> 18:47.587
WHAT WOULD BUDDHA SAY?

18:49.299 --> 18:51.049
PROBABLY...

18:51.050 --> 18:53.051
"O.M.G., YOUR MOM
TOTALLY SUCKS!"

18:53.052 --> 18:55.554
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
LOOK, MAYBE MAYBE...

18:55.555 --> 18:59.057
MAYBE I DID THIS THE WRONG WAY.

18:59.058 --> 19:01.640
I JUST REALLY
WANTED TO MEET YOU.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.852
MAYBE IF WE JUST TAKE
A LITTLE TIME...

19:03.853 --> 19:07.896
I COULD COME BACK AND
WE CAN TRY IT AGAIN?

19:07.897 --> 19:09.188
YOU'RE LEAVING?

19:09.189 --> 19:11.770
JUST FOR NOW. OKAY?

19:11.771 --> 19:13.862
BUT I'M NOT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

19:13.863 --> 19:15.074
HERE.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.198
I WROTE DOWN MY NUMBER FOR
YOU ON A PIECE OF PAPER.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.369
OKAY?

19:20.370 --> 19:22.951
YOU CALL ME ANYTIME YOU WANT.

19:22.952 --> 19:24.284
OKAY?

19:28.127 --> 19:30.379
OOH, I THINK HE'S COMING NOW.
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED, GLORIA.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.552
OF COURSE YOU'LL BE FIRST.
YES, BEFORE THERESA!

19:37.217 --> 19:39.177
WELL...

19:39.178 --> 19:40.560
AT LEAST I GOT TO MEET HER.

19:42.352 --> 19:44.433
THEY'RE PACKING UP,
LEAVING TOMORROW.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.144
GOING ON TOUR WITH CHEAP TRICK.

19:46.145 --> 19:48.647
OOH, CHEAP TRICK. DO YOU THINK
FELICIA COULD GET US BACKSTAGE?

19:48.648 --> 19:52.732
I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW RIGHT AWAY.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.864
THIS IS WHAT HER MOM WANTS.

19:55.865 --> 19:57.025
YOU KNOW, AND AS
THE TEST TUBE GUY,

19:57.026 --> 19:58.156
I DON'T REALLY GET A VOTE HERE.

19:58.157 --> 20:01.320
I KNOW THIS HAS
BEEN A TOUGH DAY.

20:01.321 --> 20:04.162
I JUST WISH THERE WAS A WAY I
COULD MAKE IT BETTER FOR YOU.

20:04.163 --> 20:05.535
THERE IS.

20:08.418 --> 20:09.379
MARRY ME.

20:09.380 --> 20:11.381
WELL, THAT I CAN DO.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.387
AND LET ME PICK THE RADIO
STATION ON THE WAY HOME.

20:18.388 --> 20:20.218
YEAH... RIGHT.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.220
COME ON, HONEY, PLEASE.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.223
( overlapping arguing )

20:32.021 --> 20:33.902
( groans )

20:33.903 --> 20:36.815
I DON'T WANNA GO IN THERE AND HAVE
TO EXPLAIN THIS TO EVERYBODY, MEL.

20:36.816 --> 20:38.357
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA SLEEP
IN THE GARAGE TONIGHT.

20:38.358 --> 20:40.238
LOOK, YOU'LL SEE
DANI AGAIN SOON,

20:40.239 --> 20:41.820
AND THE NEXT TIME
IT'LL BE EASIER.

20:41.821 --> 20:43.121
I JUST GOTTA CLEAR MY HEAD.

20:43.122 --> 20:45.494
WELL, I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.416
OUR HOUSE IS FULL OF OUR
RELATIVES RIGHT NOW.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.328
- WELL, HOW ABOUT IN THE CAR?
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

20:49.329 --> 20:51.630
RIGHT HERE ON THE STREET? WHERE
ANYBODY WALKING BY CAN JUST SEE US?

20:51.631 --> 20:52.832
LET'S DO IT.

21:00.510 --> 21:01.680
HEY, GUYS.

21:01.681 --> 21:03.091
DANI?

21:03.092 --> 21:05.013
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:05.014 --> 21:07.476
LIKE I WAS GONNA MISS
MY DAD'S WEDDING.

21:07.477 --> 21:09.267
DOES YOUR MOM KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.269
ARE YOU KIDDING? SHE'D
GROUND ME TILL I'M DEAD

21:11.270 --> 21:12.481
IF SHE KNEW. ( gasps )

21:12.482 --> 21:16.064
OH, BY THE WAY, YOU GUYS
GOT $375 FOR THE CAB?

21:16.065 --> 21:17.856
WELL, LET'S SAY $400.

21:17.857 --> 21:20.359
CAB DRIVER SHOULD
GET A TIP, RIGHT?

21:20.360 --> 21:21.530
OH, LOOK AT HER,

21:21.531 --> 21:24.824
BEING ALL RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF.
