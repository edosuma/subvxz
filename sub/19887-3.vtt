WEBVTT

00:12.600 --> 00:18.159
'Hi, I'm back, and as you can see,

00:18.200 --> 00:20.280
I've tidied!

00:23.039 --> 00:28.119
Rant of the week is going to be
on a topic close to all of us.

00:28.159 --> 00:30.159
Money.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.119
And by money, I mean debt.

00:42.119 --> 00:47.720
You know, the type we won't pay
off in, what, 60 years maybe?

00:49.079 --> 00:51.319
And that's just the fees.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.639
I mean, that doesn't include the 100
quid a week for the hutch here...

00:57.280 --> 01:03.439
.. which, full disclosure, is
paid for by the Bank of Dad.

01:11.079 --> 01:15.720
Anyway, there's the debt
and that's bad enough.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.560
But then there's the whole, like...

01:19.600 --> 01:22.159
commodity side of it.

01:23.639 --> 01:24.959
I mean,

01:25.839 --> 01:30.039
this is supposed to be
about learning, isn't it?

01:32.360 --> 01:35.560
About bettering our prospects.

01:36.239 --> 01:39.519
I mean, that's what
university was set up for.

01:45.759 --> 01:51.000
But now our education and
our debt is their commodity.

01:51.039 --> 01:53.959
We are how they make money.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
We are their product and they know that.

01:57.039 --> 02:01.239
And that's why these uni
committees are stuffed full

02:01.280 --> 02:05.800
with businessmen who are trying to work
out ways to extract more cash from us.

02:06.839 --> 02:12.479
And we go along with it because we've been
told that we're making our lives better.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.239
It's a total scam.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.920
Anyway, I'm done with it.

02:22.600 --> 02:28.479
And I know people won't listen
and that I'll hack people off,

02:28.519 --> 02:31.200
but you have to speak up sometimes.

02:31.239 --> 02:32.959
Don't you?

02:37.159 --> 02:41.560
And, Dad, if you are watching...

02:43.000 --> 02:44.519
.. just don't worry.

02:45.639 --> 02:47.720
You know I always land on my feet.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.119
Excuse me, love.

04:06.119 --> 04:07.839
The body's over there, ma'am.

04:07.879 --> 04:10.720
- Kenny, here she is.
- Ma'am?

04:10.759 --> 04:14.000
There's at least three people
over there videoing this.

04:14.039 --> 04:16.479
Sorry, I'll have a word.

04:16.519 --> 04:19.600
Our victim's called James Marshall.

04:19.639 --> 04:22.039
His friends call him Jamie.

04:22.079 --> 04:26.720
Final year, studying journalism. 21.

04:26.759 --> 04:28.360
21, eh?

04:29.360 --> 04:33.159
Now, there's no glass, so did
he come through that gap?

04:33.200 --> 04:35.560
What is that building anyway? Library?

04:35.600 --> 04:37.479
Former science building.

04:37.519 --> 04:41.159
The body was found about ten past
seven by this fella just here.

04:42.639 --> 04:44.920
Steve Devonshire, head of security.

04:44.959 --> 04:49.039
No eyewitnesses saw him come down,
but there was a reception just here.

04:49.079 --> 04:50.839
Well, that's a definite line of sight.

04:50.879 --> 04:53.239
Some of them have dispersed,
but I've got a guest list.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.000
- Bet that put a dampener
on the party. - Yeah.

04:58.079 --> 05:03.600
Right. Hicham, I want the crime scene
extended all the way down to the gate,

05:03.639 --> 05:08.119
and TIEs on everyone who
visited this facility today.

05:08.759 --> 05:12.079
And secure and search the
student halls in town.

05:16.839 --> 05:20.319
OK, Tony, what have we got?

05:22.039 --> 05:25.119
Cause of death asphyxia,
from the internal bleeding.

05:25.159 --> 05:28.639
- Conscious or not?
- It's impossible to say.

05:31.319 --> 05:33.600
What's this?

05:34.280 --> 05:37.280
- That's not blood, is it?
- I'd use the word discharge.

05:37.319 --> 05:40.519
It's due to the basilar skull
fracture, which in layman's terms is --

05:40.560 --> 05:44.119
- No, I'm all right with the
proper terms. - Of course.

05:44.159 --> 05:46.839
He's grabbed hold of this plastic,

05:46.879 --> 05:49.959
so I'd say he came from the top.

05:50.519 --> 05:53.000
Well, I'd better go up.

05:54.239 --> 05:57.200
I'm guessing there's no lift.
You've got your pumps, Kenny?

05:57.239 --> 06:01.720
Ah, we have a problem, ma'am.
Apparently the structure's unsafe.

06:01.759 --> 06:04.360
He won't give us access.
For our own safety.

06:04.400 --> 06:09.119
Don't tell me this is a
rag week prank gone wrong.

06:09.159 --> 06:12.920
Shona Adams called, said someone
was messing about up there.

06:14.079 --> 06:16.039
And Shona Adams is...?

06:16.079 --> 06:18.920
Executive in the Vice Chancellor's office.

06:19.439 --> 06:21.600
You'll need a prints
and DNA sample from me.

06:21.639 --> 06:25.360
I checked for signs of life, then
secured the scene as best I could.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.079
- Are you ex-police?
- Yeah.

06:28.119 --> 06:32.000
- Ah.
- 26 years. Avon and Somerset.

06:32.039 --> 06:34.680
But you don't get used to that, do you?

06:34.720 --> 06:37.720
No. No, you don't.

06:37.759 --> 06:40.319
Poor lad, he must have been desperate.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.839
You couldn't get us up there, could you?

06:45.079 --> 06:47.159
I'm sorry, my hands are tied.

06:47.200 --> 06:51.639
Most I can do is give you this, for your
own risk assessment. Survey they had done.

06:51.680 --> 06:56.439
Ah, come on. I've taken a risk on more
ramshackle than that. I bet you have and all.

06:56.479 --> 07:00.079
Surveyor's number's there. You'd
need to clear access with him.

07:02.879 --> 07:04.720
Aiden.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.680
I'm looking for Shona Adams.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.519
- The lady in the black there.
- Right.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.519
- See if anyone's taken photos.
- From the party?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.879
- The party, the building,
the body. - Right.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.519
Shona Adams?

07:28.560 --> 07:29.759
Right?

07:29.800 --> 07:32.519
Is there somewhere quiet
we can talk, love?

07:33.479 --> 07:35.720
As soon as I saw him up
on the old science block,

07:35.759 --> 07:40.079
I came through here to get my phone,
called Mr Devonshire right away.

07:40.119 --> 07:43.879
- Do you have a rough idea of what time?
- Yes, I could see the clock.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.839
I had to speak at seven
and it was just before.

07:46.879 --> 07:49.720
So you didn't see him fall?

07:49.759 --> 07:53.360
No. I went back through to the
reception while I was on my phone.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.400
It's just such a waste.

07:55.439 --> 07:59.560
- Did you know him personally?
- No, but I've been through his records.

08:00.319 --> 08:03.959
Good student. No trouble, no warnings.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.479
As regards informing his family, is
that something the university should...?

08:09.519 --> 08:12.680
No, you'd best leave that to us, love.

08:13.519 --> 08:16.000
The surveyor's here. Well, that was quick.

08:16.039 --> 08:19.400
- You called him earlier, right?
- Yes.

08:19.439 --> 08:25.439
I needed to establish the university's
position vis-a-vis liability and insurance.

08:37.839 --> 08:41.439
I can't overemphasise how
unstable the structure is.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.680
That lad walked through
it without it collapsing.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.319
Look, I'm sorry,

08:45.360 --> 08:49.479
but I think your superior would be reluctant
to place you or your colleagues in danger.

08:49.519 --> 08:52.239
Well, let's get a second
opinion. Get onto the surveyors.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.800
Mr Greenhill, can you compromise at all?

08:54.839 --> 08:57.720
We will get access to that building.

08:58.159 --> 09:00.159
Maybe there's a bit of wiggle room.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.360
If you have one of our
engineers with you...

09:05.400 --> 09:07.280
Problem solved.

09:19.119 --> 09:21.000
What's happening?

09:21.039 --> 09:23.560
Someone fell from the roof
of the old science block.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.879
I heard it was that guy Jamie Marshall.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.119
How many rooms are there, Kenny?

09:51.159 --> 09:53.839
45. A lot of people are out at the moment,

09:53.879 --> 09:56.839
but we've found a girl who
says she's his best friend.

09:56.879 --> 09:58.479
Her name is Lucy Curran.

09:58.519 --> 10:01.839
- She's just over there, ma'am.
- Right. Thanks, Ken.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.159
Lucy?

10:18.239 --> 10:21.039
We're police. I'm Vera, this is Aiden.

10:21.879 --> 10:25.800
We're sorry about your friend, love.

10:25.839 --> 10:29.119
Is there someone who can
come and sit with you?

10:30.879 --> 10:32.519
Did he jump?

10:34.560 --> 10:36.280
We don't know.

10:36.879 --> 10:38.479
It's what everyone's saying.

10:38.519 --> 10:42.800
Ah, there'll be a lot of rumours. My
advice would be to turn that thing off.

10:43.479 --> 10:46.039
Why, do you think he might have jumped?

10:46.079 --> 10:49.920
The last couple of weeks
he's been off with me.

10:49.959 --> 10:51.800
In what way?

10:51.839 --> 10:54.839
Distant. Not the Jamie I know.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.159
And that's what people call him, is it?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.639
Jamie?

11:00.680 --> 11:02.959
I mean, it's important we get that right.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.519
When did you last see Jamie?

11:11.280 --> 11:12.800
Go on. What?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.879
This afternoon.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.479
There was a guy banging on his door.

11:17.519 --> 11:20.280
Banging? What, aggressively?

11:20.319 --> 11:22.800
Yeah, aggressively.

11:22.839 --> 11:25.039
I could hear them shouting at each other.

11:25.079 --> 11:27.639
- What time was that?
- Three.

11:27.680 --> 11:31.519
- Can you describe this fella to us?
- 50, maybe.

11:32.400 --> 11:37.159
I asked Jamie, but he
said he had the wrong room.

11:39.319 --> 11:41.959
So do you think he was lying about that?

11:43.759 --> 11:45.400
Mm?

11:48.239 --> 11:50.639
OK, love. First thing tomorrow,

11:50.680 --> 11:54.800
I'm going to need you to come down to
the station and give us a statement.

11:56.879 --> 11:58.479
Right. Good girl.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.879
Kenny, don't lean on the door.

12:14.759 --> 12:16.879
- Ma'am? - I need you to
shout up a prints team.

12:16.920 --> 12:22.319
Get this door dusted down. And the
corridor. See what they can salvage.

12:23.400 --> 12:27.360
- And see if there's any
CCTV in the area. - Will do.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.159
Visitors' logs, swipe cards, the lot.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.600
Anyone entering or
leaving around 3pm today.

12:33.639 --> 12:35.239
OK, no worries.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.639
What did she say?

12:38.680 --> 12:41.920
- Old fella, 50s.
- Yeah, well, 50 isn't old.

12:41.959 --> 12:45.600
Ah. It doesn't narrow it down
intelligence-wise, does it?

12:46.720 --> 12:51.759
I'll get Mark to check with Organised
Crime, see what Jamie's name flags up.

12:58.319 --> 13:02.720
- Looks like he had a party.
- Or a fight.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.680
The computer.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.400
Somebody's made a mess of that.

13:09.439 --> 13:11.360
Yeah, and why would they do that?

13:12.560 --> 13:16.439
See if Mark can recover
the hard drive, asap.

13:25.759 --> 13:28.159
There are cheques here from a newspaper.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.159
Was he selling stories about the place?

13:32.439 --> 13:34.439
Hm.

13:39.039 --> 13:41.439
Political scandals...

13:46.600 --> 13:49.800
.. organised crime,
corruption... you get on.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.159
What do you make of this?

14:16.519 --> 14:20.319
I don't know. Looks like one of those
Pinterest things people do on the internet.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.680
Yeah, but that's out
in cyberspace, isn't it?

14:24.759 --> 14:26.720
This is the back of his wardrobe.

14:32.879 --> 14:35.920
It's a positive on alcohol
in the bloodstream.

14:35.959 --> 14:39.400
- So it's just booze? Nothing else?
- Just booze.

14:39.439 --> 14:42.639
But enough to impair
judgement, lose motor stability.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.519
Maybe he just fell, then?

14:45.560 --> 14:49.959
Well, if he was pushed, I can't give
you anything to support that. I'm sorry.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.959
Right, OK. Thanks, Tony.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh, Vera?

14:56.800 --> 15:01.680
There are, however, signs of another
attack, but... not that killed him.

15:05.079 --> 15:09.439
See that, and there?
Now, these are recent.

15:10.119 --> 15:12.879
- What, from today?
- No, at least a couple of days old.

15:12.920 --> 15:16.879
It looks as though somebody's
grabbed him, like that, and then...

15:17.439 --> 15:23.239
So he was beaten up, just a
couple of days before he died.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.560
- Dr Carmichael, this just
got sent on a bike. - Thanks.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.200
- Is that his?
- Mm-hm.

15:35.119 --> 15:37.959
Oh. Right. OK.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.360
- What?
- It's not quite what I thought.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.680
The discharge from his nose, that
wasn't from a basilar skull fracture.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.319
Right.

15:45.360 --> 15:49.720
- I've made a misjudgement. I'm sorry.
- Ah, shut up. We've all done that.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.879
You see this? Displaced septum.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.759
He was punched?

15:54.800 --> 15:58.839
Yep. Single blow to the
nose, considerable force.

16:00.239 --> 16:04.200
And you missed it, because
there's no bruising...

16:04.959 --> 16:08.920
.. because the blow was struck
just before his heart stopped,

16:08.959 --> 16:14.920
- which means he was punched
and then he fell. - Correct.

16:22.360 --> 16:27.479
Right. Mark, the victim's mobile.
Get on to the network provider.

16:27.519 --> 16:31.000
I want a list of all calls
and texts, and copies

16:31.039 --> 16:33.720
- of any recent photos he
might have taken. - Yes, ma'am.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.560
- Hicham, where are we on next of kin?
- No change.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.560
- What?
- Wrong surname.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.879
He enrolled as James Marshall, but
his birth name was James Stoddart.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.560
- He changed it by deed poll four years ago.
- Well, chase that, then.

16:46.600 --> 16:50.239
Plus the next of kin details he gave
the university, father and sister,

16:50.280 --> 16:53.000
- they don't exist.
- What do you mean, they don't exist?

16:53.039 --> 16:56.600
He's gone to a lot of trouble to cover
his birth identity. A lot of trouble.

16:56.639 --> 17:01.560
- His real parents must be somewhere.
- Well, let's find them, Kenny.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.039
So what does this tell us, hm?

17:04.079 --> 17:09.319
He was secretive. He was
leading a double life. What?

17:09.360 --> 17:11.759
And throwing himself into it, head first.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.159
- Is that meant to be funny?
- No. No.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.000
- Well, Jamie Marshall was
a serial vlogger. - A what?

17:19.039 --> 17:21.239
Vlogger. It's video logs.

17:21.280 --> 17:25.800
Look, loads of talk about politics,
injustice, stuff like that.

17:25.839 --> 17:29.039
But this made-up family of his, he
goes on about them all the time.

17:29.079 --> 17:33.159
His dad was an investment banker and
his sister was doing a PhD in Shanghai.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.439
He's really proud of them.

17:35.479 --> 17:38.639
Right, so he's a fantasist. Goes
to university, reinvents himself.

17:38.680 --> 17:42.560
Yeah. More to the point, see if
Jamie Stoddart has a criminal record.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.000
Next on the list.

17:44.039 --> 17:48.000
- Right, now let's have a look at his latest
video. - Oh, I've not finished it yet.

17:48.039 --> 17:50.319
- Well, let's see what
you've got. - Yeah.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.079
'.. deal with all this

17:52.119 --> 17:55.639
and, sort of, why will no-one talk to us?

17:56.759 --> 17:59.200
It's time to take a stand, everyone.

17:59.239 --> 18:01.879
It's time to make our voices heard.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.079
Unless your voice doesn't agree
with mine and then, well...

18:08.079 --> 18:11.000
Here you are. This is the
knocking that Lucy heard.

18:11.239 --> 18:13.959
So here comes our angry 50-year-old.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
- It's not the end.
- Well, fast-forward to the end.

18:21.519 --> 18:26.239
You know what? See, I know a lot
of things about a lot of people...

18:27.280 --> 18:30.280
.. and I can make 'em pay, you see.

18:30.319 --> 18:31.720
It's kamikaze time!

18:35.800 --> 18:38.079
He's on self-destruct.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.360
Less than two hours before he died.

18:45.879 --> 18:48.800
What on earth was this lad mixed up in?

18:50.639 --> 18:53.280
And who was he going to make pay?

19:18.200 --> 19:20.400
He looked after me.

19:20.439 --> 19:24.600
There are a lot of public-school types
in our halls, but he had my back.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.439
He just got on with everyone.

19:29.479 --> 19:31.959
That's why this doesn't make sense.

19:36.439 --> 19:40.720
Was there anyone else in his
life? Did he have a girlfriend?

19:40.759 --> 19:44.800
In the first year, yeah. Karen,
an American girl. Went back.

19:44.839 --> 19:46.439
No-one since?

19:46.479 --> 19:52.039
- Not in three years?
- No. Their break-up was a bit of a nightmare.

19:52.079 --> 19:54.159
I think he was really hurt by it.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.959
Were you ever his girlfriend?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.239
No. Wasn't ever like that.

20:00.319 --> 20:03.639
OK. Right. Well, thanks
for coming in, love.

20:08.759 --> 20:12.560
Have you met his dad or his sister?

20:12.600 --> 20:17.920
I think his sister's in Shanghai and
his dad travels a lot for business.

20:17.959 --> 20:21.879
Ah. We think he made 'em up.

20:23.239 --> 20:25.879
- Made them up?
- Mm.

20:28.479 --> 20:31.720
But... who'll look after him?

20:32.600 --> 20:34.239
Who does... the funeral?

20:37.600 --> 20:41.360
Right. Guests at the
party. Have we found them?

20:41.400 --> 20:44.200
- How many and what are they telling us?
- 83 and counting,

20:44.239 --> 20:48.280
but, so far, no-one saw him fall or saw
anyone enter or leave the building.

20:48.319 --> 20:50.639
Oh, brilliant! Kenny?

20:50.680 --> 20:54.319
Sorry, ma'am, nothing to put Jamie
or anyone else up on that building.

20:54.360 --> 20:58.879
You're kidding me. They've
got to have found something.

20:58.920 --> 21:02.319
Should have used that Celtic
charm of yours, Kenny.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.479
Now, Mark, criminal records?

21:04.519 --> 21:07.519
No. He's clean, as James
Marshall and James Stoddart.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.600
So we've got nothing.

21:10.759 --> 21:15.839
Right. Main line of inquiry,
apart from locating relatives,

21:15.879 --> 21:19.759
is who attacked him last week?

21:19.800 --> 21:23.639
Now is it this 50-something male
who he threatened the day he died,

21:23.680 --> 21:25.360
according to his mate Lucy?

21:25.400 --> 21:30.439
And why after this confrontation
did he go 'kamikaze time'?

21:30.479 --> 21:32.920
Do we take that at face
value? Planning to top himself

21:32.959 --> 21:34.879
- and take others with him?
- Well...

21:37.119 --> 21:41.439
Or... do we take it the opposite way?

21:41.479 --> 21:46.079
That he was planning to sacrifice
himself for the good of others?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.200
That's interesting.

21:50.639 --> 21:53.360
Now, Hicham, money.

21:53.400 --> 21:57.959
Check his bank accounts, credit
cards, student loan, the lot.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.039
See if there's a link to anyone
who might have been chasing him.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.680
When we heard about it, I was going to
text him, ask him to cover the story.

22:29.720 --> 22:32.439
- I never dreamed it would be him. - Oh.

22:32.479 --> 22:36.839
So that's what you paid him for,
is it? Stories from the campus?

22:36.879 --> 22:38.800
More or less, yeah.

22:38.839 --> 22:43.439
There's always a market for, you know,
antics, student politics, that sort of thing.

22:44.319 --> 22:49.280
Did he ever cover crime
stories? Investigate anything?

22:49.319 --> 22:52.879
No, no. I wouldn't have asked him to do
anything that would put him in danger.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.200
So he wouldn't have come
into contact with anyone

22:55.239 --> 22:57.400
who might have been,
you know, a bit dodgy?

22:57.439 --> 22:59.079
Not on my watch, no.

22:59.839 --> 23:03.479
That said, he did tell me he was working
on something that would ruffle feathers.

23:03.519 --> 23:05.439
And what was that?

23:05.479 --> 23:07.639
(Oh, bloody hell.)

23:09.720 --> 23:12.720
- What? Go on.
- He was a lovely lad.

23:13.800 --> 23:17.519
I hope he didn't embroil himself
in something just to impress me.

23:19.239 --> 23:22.159
So you're saying he might
have ruffled feathers.

23:23.879 --> 23:29.119
I don't know for sure, but...
I just wasn't listening.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.800
I should have sat him down, but I...

23:35.200 --> 23:36.400
.. I encouraged him.

23:37.879 --> 23:43.119
Right, every story he worked on, whether
you ran it or not, I'll need copies.

23:43.159 --> 23:45.879
- Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely.
- Thanks, love.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.039
I'd like you to think back
to when you last saw him.

23:52.079 --> 23:54.119
- No.
- Have a good look.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.600
No.

23:56.639 --> 23:58.639
- No, no recollections?
- No. Sorry.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.959
Just hold on a second.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.839
Excuse me. Excuse me!

24:02.879 --> 24:04.800
Yes, you!

24:06.720 --> 24:10.720
Can you just hang back a minute? We're
talking to everyone who was on the rugby team.

24:10.759 --> 24:12.759
- Why?
- Why?

24:12.800 --> 24:15.639
Because you were all training
at Stephenson Priory on Monday.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.360
- No, I wasn't!
- Oi!

24:41.439 --> 24:43.119
Aiden?

24:43.159 --> 24:46.959
Refusing to say a word till
his representation arrives.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.079
Are those the statements
from the teammates?

24:49.119 --> 24:50.920
Yeah. Very useful they were.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.479
Has that lad's lawyer showed up yet?

24:55.519 --> 24:57.319
No. Why?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.680
Alan Marston.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.519
You're kidding me.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.879
- What? - That lad you've
just pulled out, Rory Marston,

25:04.920 --> 25:08.439
his old man just happens to be
the defence lawyer from hell.

25:08.479 --> 25:12.159
Kenny's been on a few sliding tackles
from old Alan Marston, haven't you, pet?

25:12.200 --> 25:15.119
You don't want to go into the
witness box with that toe-rag

25:15.159 --> 25:18.560
unless you've got a cast-iron
case, because he will rip the...

25:19.239 --> 25:22.519
The boy has a lecture at four
o'clock. I'd like him to be there.

25:22.560 --> 25:27.879
Oh. Are you talking as his
father or his lawyer, pet?

25:27.920 --> 25:29.560
Both.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.519
I thought you'd have bumped
yourself upstairs by now.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.920
I like to keep my hand in at the coalface.

25:34.959 --> 25:38.159
- Hard but fair, eh?
- Always.

25:38.200 --> 25:41.159
- Why is he here?
- Because he lied to my sergeant.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.119
- He was near our crime scene,
said he wasn't. - He didn't lie.

25:44.159 --> 25:46.959
He wanted to avoid questions
because he had to be elsewhere.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.680
- Simple as that.
- Why not just say that then?

25:49.720 --> 25:54.280
Perhaps he's never spoken to a
police officer before. And...

25:54.319 --> 25:56.000
What?

25:56.039 --> 25:58.839
Rory's younger sister goes
into surgery later today.

25:58.879 --> 26:00.680
He wanted to see her.

26:02.600 --> 26:07.879
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Alan.
But I do need to question Rory.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.119
But you can bring him
back later, if you like.

26:10.159 --> 26:12.959
- What time would suit?
- Let's just get it cleared up.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.519
Did you know a Jamie Marshall?

26:24.119 --> 26:26.400
Not really. I'd seen him around.

26:26.439 --> 26:29.400
Well, did you know him or didn't you?

26:30.200 --> 26:32.000
I didn't know him.

26:32.039 --> 26:36.079
Yesterday evening, what was the
route of your practice run?

26:36.119 --> 26:39.720
A loop from the changing rooms, through
the woodland path, back to the Priory.

26:39.759 --> 26:41.479
What time did you leave?

26:42.519 --> 26:44.119
Quarter to seven.

26:44.159 --> 26:45.959
What time did you get back?

26:46.000 --> 26:49.680
I'm not sure. About quarter past.

26:49.720 --> 26:54.280
Ah, now, now, now, according to your
teammates, you got back at half past.

26:54.319 --> 26:56.439
Now these are their statements,

26:56.479 --> 26:59.920
and they reckon you got in about
15 minutes after everyone else,

26:59.959 --> 27:02.119
and you were badly out of breath,

27:02.159 --> 27:05.079
even though you're the
fittest member of the squad.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.200
- No comment.
- The boy's dead, Rory.

27:10.239 --> 27:11.959
This is serious, son.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.720
Now, these guys need
to get this cleared up,

27:14.759 --> 27:16.879
and the family deserve
to know what happened.

27:16.920 --> 27:20.200
So, please. Answer the question.

27:26.560 --> 27:30.879
I had a few beers in the afternoon,
so I wasn't really at it at training.

27:30.920 --> 27:33.039
You were drinking in the afternoon?

27:33.079 --> 27:38.800
So between 6:55pm and
7:10 yesterday evening,

27:38.839 --> 27:42.319
did you detour from your training
run to the old science block?

27:42.360 --> 27:44.519
No.

27:44.560 --> 27:48.759
- Did you see Jamie Marshall at
Stephenson's Priory last evening? - No.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.680
Do you know who was up
on that building with him?

27:51.720 --> 27:55.479
- Maybe no-one was up there with him.
- Ah, no, no. Someone was with him.

27:55.519 --> 27:58.200
That much we do know.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.479
OK.

28:01.519 --> 28:06.759
Rory, did you have anything to do
with the death of James Marshall?

28:07.720 --> 28:09.319
No. Of course I didn't.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.720
- You're sure about that?
- Absolutely.

28:11.759 --> 28:14.119
So unless you have trace evidence

28:14.159 --> 28:18.479
or eyewitnesses that can place Rory at
the scene of Jamie's death, we're done.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.600
Are we done?

28:26.759 --> 28:28.759
You can go.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.519
I'd call that a nil-nil draw.

28:35.039 --> 28:37.560
Alan Marston knows how to
play the game, doesn't he?

28:37.600 --> 28:39.759
He even showed his
sympathy for the victim.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.920
- Ah, he always does that.
- Aye, he does.

28:42.959 --> 28:44.680
Ah, maybe he means it.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.400
So what's his wife like?

28:46.439 --> 28:49.720
She died when the kids were young.
He brought them up on his own.

28:49.759 --> 28:54.720
- Mark... Dug anything up on the deceased?
- A full financial profile.

28:54.759 --> 28:58.560
He maxed out on four credit
cards plus three online loans,

28:58.600 --> 29:00.639
not to mention a two-grand overdraft.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.479
Right, so that's how he
keeps up the rich-kid image.

29:03.519 --> 29:05.200
Any progress on family?

29:05.239 --> 29:08.600
Father's a Derek Stoddart, but
I don't have a current address.

29:08.639 --> 29:11.879
Seems to have moved a fair few
times in the last two years.

29:11.920 --> 29:14.479
Last place, upped sticks
and defaulted on the rent.

29:14.519 --> 29:18.039
Well, that's not exactly the mark
of an investment banker, is it?

29:19.039 --> 29:21.119
Or maybe it is these days.

29:23.959 --> 29:25.959
Hang on.

29:26.839 --> 29:30.360
What's a young posh lad like Jamie
doing down the Dog And Crown?

29:30.400 --> 29:34.039
There was a metro ticket in his stuff.
I'll see if there's images of him.

29:34.079 --> 29:37.000
Well, he was down there twice last week,

29:37.039 --> 29:41.400
which fits timewise with
when he took that beating.

29:41.439 --> 29:45.759
If Jamie was looking for trouble, that
pub is certainly the place to find it.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.560
Aye.

30:02.439 --> 30:04.439
Listen, son.

30:04.479 --> 30:08.680
If I don't know everything,
I can't help you.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.600
Oi, don't touch that!

30:47.280 --> 30:50.720
Yeah. The two of them sat
over there in the corner.

30:50.759 --> 30:55.000
- So the person he was with,
male or female? - A bloke.

30:56.039 --> 30:57.319
Right, what were they doing?

30:57.400 --> 30:59.800
Talking, drinking. You know, it's a pub.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.280
Was there any aggro between them?

31:03.319 --> 31:05.159
Not that I noticed.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.839
Now, this bloke the lad
was with, is he a regular?

31:07.879 --> 31:11.920
Nah, he's not a regular. He pops in
every now and then for a tea-timer.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.200
- Have you got a name?
- No.

31:21.759 --> 31:23.920
But I know where he works.

31:27.600 --> 31:33.959
Er, Lexi and Jo on the back
wall. On the back wall!

31:34.479 --> 31:36.400
Ready, steady...

31:38.720 --> 31:41.959
- Excuse me. Mr Holland?
- Yeah.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.759
Mr Holland, can we have a word, sir?

31:49.639 --> 31:53.159
We're just wondering if
you could help us at all?

31:53.200 --> 31:54.800
Yeah, if I can.

31:54.839 --> 31:57.800
Right. Do you recognise this fella?

31:59.600 --> 32:02.479
Yeah, I know him. Well, what happened?

32:02.519 --> 32:06.560
- How well do you know him?
- Um, not that well.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.239
But you spent two nights in
the pub with him last week.

32:09.280 --> 32:13.280
Yeah. Um, he was writing
a book about my dad.

32:13.319 --> 32:17.000
He was one of the guys trapped in
the Allenby Pit back in the '70s.

32:17.039 --> 32:21.920
Yes, I remember. Some miners were trapped
underground. Three days, wasn't it?

32:21.959 --> 32:26.560
Yeah. Jamie traced me. He was
looking for stories, anecdotes.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.439
Did he talk about himself at all?

32:28.920 --> 32:33.079
Not much. I tend to go on a bit
when I'm talking about my dad.

32:33.119 --> 32:37.119
He didn't mention anything that was
troubling him, you know, in passing?

32:38.319 --> 32:40.239
Anything?

32:40.920 --> 32:43.239
No. I couldn't say. Sorry.

32:43.280 --> 32:49.639
Only it's our understanding that he
was the victim of a violent assault

32:49.680 --> 32:52.000
during the two days we're talking about.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.119
And you'd think it'd be
something that might come up.

32:56.159 --> 32:57.759
It honestly didn't.

33:02.119 --> 33:05.439
Can I ask where you were
yesterday, between 6:00 and 8:00pm?

33:05.479 --> 33:07.879
- Yesterday?
- Mm.

33:07.920 --> 33:12.200
- That's when he died?
- It's just so we can rule you out.

33:13.879 --> 33:19.039
I was on my own. Um, things were
quiet here, so I knocked off early.

33:19.079 --> 33:21.119
Gayle went home.

33:21.159 --> 33:24.639
I went for a walk along the coastal path.

33:24.680 --> 33:28.000
You see anyone? Speak to anyone?

33:28.039 --> 33:30.600
Anyone who can verify that?

33:31.759 --> 33:34.079
No. Sorry.

33:35.720 --> 33:40.239
- You're expecting?
- Twins. IVF.

33:41.479 --> 33:43.600
We've been trying for three years.

33:43.639 --> 33:46.079
Well, thanks for your time, Mr Holland.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.879
Writing a book about something
that happened 40 years ago.

33:55.920 --> 33:59.439
That doesn't sound like the Jamie Marshall
we've been getting to know, does it?

33:59.479 --> 34:01.079
No, it doesn't.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.280
- Hicham. - Got the dad.
I'll text you the address.

34:11.319 --> 34:12.680
Good work!

34:12.720 --> 34:14.400
We've found the father.

34:14.439 --> 34:15.920
Now, we'll go straight over.

34:15.959 --> 34:20.479
Now, listen, Hicham, I want you
to run a check on an Ian Holland.

34:20.519 --> 34:23.560
He's got a bouncy castle
down on South Shields.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.280
And go through Jamie's things

34:25.319 --> 34:30.519
and see if there's anything about an
Allenby mining disaster back in the '70s.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.879
- Yes, ma'am.
- Right. Good lad.

34:34.079 --> 34:36.079
Are you on Facebook?

34:36.119 --> 34:38.680
No! I'm... Rory Marston's
sister, Jennifer.

34:38.720 --> 34:43.839
She was diagnosed with acute kidney failure
last November. The operation's a transplant.

35:26.839 --> 35:28.920
Tell him that you're feeling OK.

35:28.959 --> 35:32.759
I am, Rory. I really am.

35:57.400 --> 36:01.119
- This can't be it.
- That's what he said. 14, Sherwood Road.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.039
He also said his dad was
an investment banker.

36:42.239 --> 36:43.519
Amplethorpe Cars.

36:46.959 --> 36:48.839
Window smashed here.

36:54.239 --> 36:58.159
Hello? It's the police.
Can you open up, please?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.119
- Derek Stoddart?
- Aye.

37:05.159 --> 37:07.439
DCI Stanhope.

37:07.479 --> 37:09.000
Can we come in, love?

37:18.319 --> 37:20.239
- What have I done?
- Ah...

37:20.280 --> 37:22.839
What happened to your window?

37:22.879 --> 37:24.200
Yeah, it's smashed.

37:24.239 --> 37:26.839
- What window?
- The upstairs window.

37:35.839 --> 37:38.639
All right if we come up, sir?

37:43.039 --> 37:45.439
- Can you not touch that, please?
- What's this?

37:46.879 --> 37:48.879
'Your boy is dead.'

37:52.119 --> 37:53.720
Mr Stoddart.

37:55.360 --> 37:59.519
- Could you put that in there, please?
- I'll go and check with the neighbours.

37:59.560 --> 38:03.079
- What's this mean?
- I'm so sorry, love.

38:15.319 --> 38:17.319
That smashed window.

38:18.079 --> 38:21.720
- You didn't hear anything?
- I was out for the count.

38:24.360 --> 38:26.560
When did you last see Jamie?

38:28.360 --> 38:31.400
Not since he left for uni.

38:33.360 --> 38:36.639
A woman heard glass
smashing early this morning.

38:37.600 --> 38:42.439
Now, Jamie went off to uni four years ago.

38:42.479 --> 38:45.360
How is it you've not seen him since then?

38:47.039 --> 38:48.879
I don't know. He just...

38:50.360 --> 38:52.959
.. didn't want anything
to do with me any more.

38:54.639 --> 38:57.280
I tried my best.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.280
For both of them.

39:00.319 --> 39:04.720
- Both of them?
- Jamie and Bridget, his sister.

39:06.319 --> 39:08.479
She died. Heroin.

39:08.519 --> 39:11.079
Just before Jamie left.

39:11.119 --> 39:13.600
Oh, I'm so sorry, love.

39:17.319 --> 39:19.479
What about his mam?

39:21.280 --> 39:24.400
She passed away not long
after Bridget was born.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.839
They're all gone now, eh?

39:32.039 --> 39:35.479
Hey. Hey. You might want
to ease up on that, love.

39:44.519 --> 39:47.039
Do you have any idea who
might have done this?

39:48.400 --> 39:51.879
No. I keep myself to myself.

39:53.119 --> 39:55.319
Don't get involved in anyone's business.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.159
Is there anyone we can call?

39:57.200 --> 39:59.680
Have someone come and keep you company.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.720
There's no-one.

40:05.159 --> 40:07.280
Better to pass out than fall asleep.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.319
Better to come round than wake up, eh?

40:13.519 --> 40:15.280
Hey.

40:22.239 --> 40:26.039
Now you make sure you get
that window fixed, all right?

40:34.600 --> 40:39.400
And needless to say, you'll not be
driving your taxi today, will you, pet?

40:59.159 --> 41:00.920
- Poor bloke.
- Ah.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.839
His own son turning his back on him.

41:05.239 --> 41:08.039
If my lad ever did that to
me, I don't know what I'd do.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.759
What did you do? At university?

41:13.959 --> 41:15.959
Business studies.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.879
Yeah? Never had you down as an Alan Sugar.

41:21.360 --> 41:25.079
So did people often reinvent
themselves at uni then?

41:25.119 --> 41:28.200
Well, some people did. I mean,
not to the extent that Jamie did.

41:28.239 --> 41:30.000
That's not the norm, I'd say.

41:30.039 --> 41:32.280
So what was his motive, do you reckon?

41:33.119 --> 41:35.319
Embarrassment?

41:35.360 --> 41:39.519
Ambition? Maybe he felt like his
background was holding him back.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.920
His dad's not telling us
everything, I know that much.

41:45.239 --> 41:46.720
What did you study at uni?

41:46.759 --> 41:49.920
Oh, isn't that obvious, pet?

41:49.959 --> 41:50.959
Nutrition.

41:54.519 --> 41:56.159
I want the prints on that.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.239
Now, have you done the background
check on Derek Stoddart yet?

41:59.280 --> 42:01.839
- I'm in the throes of it, yes.
- Yeah? Anyone with a grudge?

42:01.879 --> 42:04.879
That brick could be some random
with a sick sense of humour.

42:04.920 --> 42:08.600
His death was reported as
Jamie Marshall, wasn't it?

42:08.639 --> 42:12.400
So whoever lobbed this brick
knew his real identity.

42:12.439 --> 42:14.319
Ma'am. You're going to want to see this.

42:14.360 --> 42:18.000
CCTV from the metro station
near the Dog And Crown.

42:18.039 --> 42:20.720
- Oh, right.
- I've found Jamie's attacker.

42:20.759 --> 42:23.759
Good work!

42:24.560 --> 42:26.319
Can you make that bigger?

42:27.479 --> 42:29.400
Rewind it.

42:30.920 --> 42:34.039
- There.
- That's Ian Holland.

42:34.079 --> 42:35.879
Kenny!

42:35.920 --> 42:38.280
Did you find anything on Ian Holland?

42:38.319 --> 42:42.560
Only just his DBS. His name
does ping up on the database,

42:42.600 --> 42:44.639
but nothing criminal.

42:45.759 --> 42:47.800
What? A hit-and-run?

42:49.519 --> 42:51.280
All right, let's bring him in.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.959
So what is he? Half your age?

43:35.800 --> 43:39.600
Ah, don't tell me -- it looks
more vicious than it was.

43:39.639 --> 43:42.159
A simple misunderstanding.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.800
What was that about?

43:46.560 --> 43:52.079
All right. Now earlier, you told me
you went for a walk yesterday evening.

43:52.119 --> 43:56.319
Did you take any little detours
whilst you was on your evening stroll?

43:58.039 --> 43:59.920
I was visiting my son.

43:59.959 --> 44:02.280
Where?

44:02.319 --> 44:04.280
Walton Way Cemetery.

44:05.079 --> 44:06.639
Ah.

44:07.759 --> 44:12.720
Nicholas. Victim of a
hit-and-run five years ago.

44:12.759 --> 44:15.000
No witnesses.

44:15.039 --> 44:18.639
- I'm sorry about that, sir.
- Sorry enough to have caught the driver?

44:19.079 --> 44:21.839
So why did you come to blows?

44:24.280 --> 44:27.119
All that stuff about the book on Allenby?

44:27.959 --> 44:30.319
- That was a lie.
- Ah, now we have it.

44:30.360 --> 44:31.959
Not my lie, his lie.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.360
He was using it as a way in with me.

44:34.400 --> 44:37.360
Turned out what he wanted
to write about was Nicky,

44:37.400 --> 44:41.839
how it'd messed my life up, how
it'd split me up with Nicky's mum.

44:41.879 --> 44:45.079
- So you lost your temper?
- It's not something that's healed.

44:47.119 --> 44:52.079
- I can see it was the wrong
thing to do. - Aye, it was.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.319
This is Nicky.

45:07.560 --> 45:09.519
You see that on his neck?

45:09.560 --> 45:11.319
Eczema. Terrible, it was.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.720
But you know what? He never complained.

45:15.759 --> 45:18.519
Not once.

45:19.280 --> 45:22.400
He just got on with it.

45:28.200 --> 45:31.119
Even this age, he was twice the man I was.

45:36.519 --> 45:39.239
I just feel rage.

45:39.879 --> 45:42.119
All the time.

45:42.159 --> 45:44.839
It's just always there.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.959
What do you think?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.360
Why was Jamie so interested in his son?

46:00.400 --> 46:03.879
- Do we need to press charges?
- Oh, aye.

46:03.920 --> 46:07.439
- What good will it do?
- Ah, nothing. No good will come of any of it.

46:08.079 --> 46:12.280
Ma'am? Uniform took these
off the party guests.

46:12.319 --> 46:14.200
Oh, right.

46:21.720 --> 46:23.720
Who's that?

46:24.360 --> 46:26.039
Alan Marston.

46:28.600 --> 46:31.839
- Impressive.
- Yeah, well.

46:31.879 --> 46:34.879
His company's got a finger in every pie.

46:34.920 --> 46:40.239
Tax law, company law, patents,
overseas investments, you name it.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.720
Ah, Mr Marston.

46:51.759 --> 46:53.800
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

46:53.839 --> 46:59.319
You didn't tell us you were at the Law
Faculty party the night Jamie died.

46:59.360 --> 47:02.360
Yes. I'm still involved with the
university. It's where I studied.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.959
But we appealed for all the
party guests to come forward.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.879
- You didn't. - I didn't witness
anything. I didn't see the point.

47:07.920 --> 47:11.680
It's my job to decide what's
relevant to the case and what isn't.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.600
- You're right.
- Mm.

47:14.639 --> 47:16.319
I've been a bit preoccupied.

47:17.879 --> 47:22.000
- How is Jennifer?
- We'll know in the next 24 hours.

47:22.039 --> 47:25.280
- Now, if you don't mind, I have to get --
- No, this won't take long.

47:32.479 --> 47:34.200
Thank you.

47:42.600 --> 47:46.360
I arrived at the reception
at 5:30 and I left at 7:15.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.039
- And were you there
the whole time? - Yes.

47:49.079 --> 47:53.759
- You didn't go outside at any point?
- No. I didn't go outside at any point.

47:53.800 --> 47:57.920
Yes, only we've got these time-coded
photos of you at the party.

47:57.959 --> 48:03.039
But between 6:40pm and 7:15pm,
you don't show up in any of 'em.

48:03.079 --> 48:07.119
And Jamie was murdered between
five to seven and ten past.

48:07.159 --> 48:11.119
I'm sure there were a lot of guests at the
party who don't show up in random photos

48:11.159 --> 48:13.039
taken between those times.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.920
Mm.

48:20.560 --> 48:24.600
Did you see your son while you were
up there? He was running nearby.

48:24.639 --> 48:27.079
No, I didn't.

48:27.119 --> 48:30.360
What, even though you only
go to the place occasionally?

48:32.200 --> 48:37.439
Trying to fool me into covering
for my son is a low blow, Vera.

48:37.479 --> 48:40.800
Well, even if you had, I wouldn't
have thought anything by it.

48:40.839 --> 48:42.600
Perfectly natural.

48:42.639 --> 48:45.360
And that's your expert
opinion on being a parent?

48:48.400 --> 48:50.119
You're right about one thing, though.

48:50.159 --> 48:51.759
It was a low blow.

48:52.560 --> 48:55.280
Thanks for your time, Alan.

48:59.639 --> 49:01.839
He's rattled, isn't he?
Why is he so rattled?

49:01.879 --> 49:04.119
Cos he's a man who's not
used to being caught out.

49:04.159 --> 49:07.680
Or he knows more about what Rory was doing
on Monday night than he's letting on.

49:07.720 --> 49:08.280
Yeah.

49:10.439 --> 49:13.560
This is DS Healy. Where are
we with Stephenson Priory?

49:15.159 --> 49:17.159
SOCOs have finished at the crime scene.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.360
It's not great, I'm afraid.

49:26.319 --> 49:28.639
Absolutely nothing.

49:28.680 --> 49:31.479
Three full sweeps. No
footprints, no skin flecks.

49:31.519 --> 49:34.159
There's got to be something.

49:36.039 --> 49:38.200
There's something we're all missing.

49:38.239 --> 49:41.879
Excuse me! I thought
you were finished here.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.720
Yeah, we'll be finished when I say so.

49:45.519 --> 49:47.959
I'm responsible for getting
the place locked up.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
Well, we'll let you know as
soon as we're done, Mr Greenhill.

49:51.039 --> 49:54.119
We've already had one fatality here.

49:54.959 --> 49:57.479
Look, I'm a big girl.

49:57.519 --> 50:01.159
He's a witness. On my own head be it.

50:09.680 --> 50:14.119
Could you get here from the
reception, kill that lad

50:14.159 --> 50:16.280
and then saunter back in ten minutes?

50:17.039 --> 50:19.600
I reckon it's possible, yeah.

50:20.959 --> 50:23.119
Might be tight, but it's possible.

50:31.519 --> 50:35.560
'I know a lot of things
about a lot of people...

50:36.800 --> 50:39.039
.. and I can make them pay.'

50:39.239 --> 50:40.879
Hm?

50:45.639 --> 50:48.680
OK. Why here?

50:51.239 --> 50:53.239
Is he looking for somewhere to hide?

50:53.280 --> 50:57.079
Looking for safety, knowing
that he's followed?

50:57.119 --> 50:59.400
Ah, it's possible.

50:59.439 --> 51:02.800
It's not exactly a great place
to arrange to meet someone, is it?

51:02.839 --> 51:04.800
Yeah. But then, that said,

51:04.839 --> 51:08.319
it's definitely quiet.
Wouldn't be overheard.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.400
That's a good place for a set-to.

51:13.319 --> 51:17.959
He's drunk, hell-bent on a
confrontation and he gets one.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.879
- Unlucky punch?
- Hm.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.560
Or maybe the killer didn't
intend for him to fall?

51:47.200 --> 51:53.239
But if our victim provoked that punch, that
suggests he planned to come here, doesn't it?

51:53.280 --> 51:55.119
But why here?

51:56.119 --> 51:57.959
What's the link?

52:11.280 --> 52:12.879
That's ten minutes fast.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.800
Miss Adams, a detail.

52:16.839 --> 52:21.239
You told us you called Mr Devonshire
at five to. Is that right?

52:21.280 --> 52:24.759
- You said you looked at the clock.
- Because I was speaking at seven, yes.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.479
Ah.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.600
- Oh, my God. It's fast, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

52:29.639 --> 52:31.439
I know that!

52:31.479 --> 52:34.319
Now can I see the phone
you called Security on?

52:34.360 --> 52:37.439
Of course. I... I'm so sorry.

52:40.639 --> 52:44.280
Yep. Call to Steve Devonshire
at 18:45, not 18:55.

52:44.319 --> 52:46.119
Have I mucked everything up?

52:46.159 --> 52:47.800
And when you spoke to Mr Devonshire

52:47.839 --> 52:51.360
and told him there was someone up
there messing about, how did he react?

52:51.400 --> 52:54.920
Well, he said he'd deal with it.
Said he'd be over right away.

52:54.959 --> 52:56.959
- And was he?
- I didn't actually see.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.639
- I was focused on my speech.
- Ah, yes. Your big speech.

53:00.680 --> 53:02.920
- It's a big job.
- Yes.

53:02.959 --> 53:09.439
So you don't strike me as being a woman who
might so easily get mixed up with the time.

53:12.600 --> 53:15.759
I'd drunk a couple of glasses
by the time we spoke.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.959
OK. If you say so.

53:24.560 --> 53:29.280
- Do you buy that? - Well, maybe.
She's not linked to the deceased.

53:29.319 --> 53:33.159
Doesn't seem like the kind of person who'd
chuck a rock through somebody's window.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.759
Clearly has an alibi,
even with the time change.

53:35.800 --> 53:40.439
But she seems more interested
in lawsuits and insurance.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.959
Maybe something's being covered up here.

53:45.039 --> 53:47.280
Something to do with that building.

53:50.600 --> 53:53.280
- Mr Devonshire.
- Ah.

53:53.319 --> 53:55.159
Hi.

53:55.200 --> 53:59.079
Hey. You're in fine
shape for a man your age.

53:59.759 --> 54:03.200
- I'm guessing you work
out? Whereas me... - Yes.

54:03.239 --> 54:07.639
I'm not the Intermediate Schools
400-metre champion I once was.

54:08.759 --> 54:14.639
Yet it's only taken me, what, 12 minutes
to get from the science block to here.

54:16.600 --> 54:23.079
Whereas you, on Monday, took a full 25
minutes to get from here to the science block.

54:23.119 --> 54:24.959
Now why was that?

54:25.000 --> 54:27.479
Well, I think you might be
getting your facts wrong.

54:27.519 --> 54:31.200
And I think you might want
to give your solicitor a buzz.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.920
We know there's nearly half an hour

54:35.959 --> 54:41.560
between him being told Jamie's up there and
him finding him dead. That much we know.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.280
So what was he doing in the meantime?

54:43.319 --> 54:47.920
- On a 14-minute call to John Greenhill.
- What, that surveyor?

54:47.959 --> 54:50.079
That would fit with your cover-up theory.

54:50.119 --> 54:52.920
Except you can't cover up
something that hasn't happened yet.

54:52.959 --> 54:55.400
Right. This call came before Jamie died.

54:55.439 --> 54:57.920
All he knew at this
point, via Shona Adams,

54:57.959 --> 55:00.639
is that there was someone
messing about on that building.

55:00.680 --> 55:03.280
Him and the surveyor
were plotting a cover-up?

55:11.600 --> 55:13.600
Or plotting something else.

55:24.159 --> 55:29.360
Now, 14 minutes and 26
seconds, Mr Devonshire.

55:29.400 --> 55:34.200
So what on earth were you and Mr
Greenhill talking about all that time?

55:34.239 --> 55:38.800
All right. I... I took
my eye off the ball.

55:40.360 --> 55:42.959
Maybe if I'd got there
sooner when I should have --

55:43.000 --> 55:45.600
- You haven't answered --
- John's my brother-in-law.

55:46.319 --> 55:49.000
- John Greenhill?
- Yeah, that's right.

55:50.560 --> 55:54.360
Him and Alice, my sister, they're
going through a bit of a rough patch.

55:55.039 --> 55:57.200
I've been trying to play peacemaker.

55:57.879 --> 56:02.879
So at best we're looking at
dereliction of duty, that right?

56:04.479 --> 56:06.519
I just thought Shona was in a flap.

56:06.560 --> 56:09.720
Students mess about.
You know what it's like.

56:09.759 --> 56:14.759
As I say, I took my eye
off the ball. I'm sorry.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.920
I've been looking at your
service record. It says here,

56:17.959 --> 56:23.119
'Highly efficient, dedicated
and rigorous officer.' Mm!

56:24.959 --> 56:27.800
So what personality change did you have,

56:27.839 --> 56:31.800
that when a lad is larking
about on a dangerous building,

56:31.839 --> 56:34.879
you, as head of the university's security,

56:34.920 --> 56:39.720
choose to spend 14 minutes on the phone
playing marriage guidance counsellor?

56:39.759 --> 56:42.079
I don't know where you think
you're going with this,

56:42.119 --> 56:46.280
- but I did not go near that boy before he died.
- Doesn't mean you don't know who did.

56:46.319 --> 56:49.200
So come on, Mr Devonshire. What
were you really talking about?

56:49.239 --> 56:51.680
- No comment.
- Well, it must have been interesting,

56:51.720 --> 56:54.800
to take precedence over an
urgent call from Shona Adams.

56:54.839 --> 56:57.560
Were you giving someone
the chance to get away?

56:58.879 --> 57:00.479
No comment.

57:01.239 --> 57:02.839
Have a word.

57:02.879 --> 57:04.879
I will keep asking.

57:11.079 --> 57:14.680
- Where are we with Greenhill?
- Devonshire's his brother-in-law.

57:14.720 --> 57:17.600
Claims he was at a Chamber of
Commerce dinner on Monday evening.

57:17.639 --> 57:22.800
Yeah, well, even if he wasn't, it doesn't
mean they're not involved in that lad's death.

57:22.839 --> 57:25.439
I want a full background
check on the pair of them.

57:25.479 --> 57:26.959
- Ma'am.
- What?

57:27.000 --> 57:30.759
Prints from the door of Jamie's
flat belong to Derek Stoddart.

57:35.600 --> 57:39.039
So drunk he forgot he
went to see his own son?

57:59.839 --> 58:02.400
Mr Stoddart? Open up! Police!

58:08.400 --> 58:10.400
He's on the floor.

58:10.439 --> 58:12.639
Get that door open. Call an ambulance.

58:18.200 --> 58:19.920
Mr Stoddart?

58:20.720 --> 58:22.879
Mr Stoddart, love?

58:24.000 --> 58:25.639
He's still breathing.

58:26.479 --> 58:28.479
I'll check the ambulance.

58:29.479 --> 58:34.000
They're taking him to the hospital now.
I need you to get over there, Kenny.

58:34.039 --> 58:38.200
He's in a bad way and as soon as he's
conscious, I need to know. Have you got that?

58:38.239 --> 58:39.879
'Will do.'

58:39.920 --> 58:44.039
A witness over there saw a bloke banging
on the door earlier. The description fits...

58:44.079 --> 58:46.560
- Fits Ian Holland.
- Yeah. Couldn't be closer.

58:46.600 --> 58:49.159
- He came straight here
from being bailed. - Aye.

58:49.200 --> 58:52.319
- Why would he beat up Jamie, then his dad?
- Why do you think, love?

58:52.360 --> 58:54.119
- Revenge?
- Revenge.

59:18.720 --> 59:23.439
If you thought Derek Stoddart was
responsible for your son's death,

59:23.479 --> 59:26.200
you should have come to us.

59:27.200 --> 59:30.560
Did Jamie tell you it was his dad
who was the hit-and-run driver?

59:30.600 --> 59:32.600
Eventually.

59:33.560 --> 59:36.479
'I want to honour Allenby
and what they went through'?

59:37.879 --> 59:40.479
He got what he deserved.

59:40.519 --> 59:42.200
A violent death?

59:42.239 --> 59:43.839
That wasn't me.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.879
Mr Holland? This way, please.

59:59.879 --> 1:00:04.800
Do you honestly expect me to believe you
had nothing to do with this lad's death?

1:00:04.839 --> 1:00:06.519
I mean, look at this.

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:08.920
Here's you knocking him about.

1:00:08.959 --> 1:00:10.839
Here's his old man. Look at him!

1:00:10.879 --> 1:00:14.360
Now that is a vicious, savage attack.

1:00:16.639 --> 1:00:20.319
I'll confess to putting that
note through Stoddart's window.

1:00:21.479 --> 1:00:23.879
I'll confess to attacking him.

1:00:24.479 --> 1:00:26.360
I've said I lost my rag with Jamie, too.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:30.079
But that's as far as it went,
though God knows I thought about it.

1:00:30.119 --> 1:00:34.039
That boy is just as guilty as his
dad, really, but that doesn't mean I --

1:00:34.079 --> 1:00:38.119
Hey, hold on. Hold on. What do you
mean, 'just as guilty as his dad'?

1:00:39.519 --> 1:00:41.319
Jamie was in the car.

1:00:43.159 --> 1:00:46.400
He saw his dad kill my son!

1:00:46.439 --> 1:00:48.200
And for five years he never said a word.

1:00:48.239 --> 1:00:50.280
That's guilt.

1:00:51.039 --> 1:00:52.639
That's wrong.

1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:55.759
That lad knew it was wrong, Mr Holland.

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:58.720
He was ashamed of his old man.

1:00:58.759 --> 1:01:02.119
And I believe he approached
you, to tell you that.

1:01:03.119 --> 1:01:05.239
So why did I have to beat it out of him?

1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:07.360
Probably couldn't find the words, love.

1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:11.639
And I expect he was scared
of what you might do.

1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:13.959
Wasn't wrong there, was he?

1:01:18.119 --> 1:01:22.800
I mean, why would he kill the one witness
who saw Stoddart run over his lad?

1:01:22.839 --> 1:01:25.280
So, could Stoddart have
killed his own son?

1:01:25.319 --> 1:01:28.039
Well, that's more than
possible. Keep digging.

1:01:31.479 --> 1:01:32.920
- You'll want to hear this.
- Eh?

1:01:32.959 --> 1:01:34.119
Yeah.

1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:37.879
- Ma'am.
- What?

1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:40.639
Greenhill and Devonshire.
They're not just related.

1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:43.360
They're both non-executives
of a Jersey-based company.

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:47.720
- What sort of company?
- Property. Tyneford Estates.

1:01:47.759 --> 1:01:50.159
- Tyneford?
- Yeah.

1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:54.200
They purchased the science block to develop
it into luxury student accommodation.

1:01:54.239 --> 1:01:56.479
Did they indeed?

1:01:56.519 --> 1:01:59.319
- How much for?
- One pound,

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:04.239
with an undertaking to make the necessary
structural repairs detailed in the survey.

1:02:04.280 --> 1:02:08.479
And before the survey, how
much was the building worth?

1:02:08.519 --> 1:02:11.239
Its market value is £1.8 million,

1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:16.839
and our forensic accountant reckons
once it's developed, it'll be worth
£8 million to £10 million.

1:02:16.879 --> 1:02:20.319
Bloody hell. A £1 stake for all that?

1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:24.360
That's Jamie's big story.
His kamikaze mission.

1:02:27.839 --> 1:02:29.839
In there.

1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:32.560
Ma'am.

1:02:33.479 --> 1:02:36.079
Stay exactly where you are, Mr Greenhill.

1:02:36.119 --> 1:02:39.759
Do not move. Do not touch
your phone or your computer.

1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:42.560
I have a warrant here to
search these premises,

1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:46.439
and a second warrant to arrest
you on suspicion of fraud.

1:02:46.479 --> 1:02:50.560
Did Jamie Marshall know about your
little scam? Is that why he's dead?

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:52.360
I was nowhere near that boy.

1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:55.159
I'd never heard of him until I
read about it in the papers.

1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:58.600
Ma'am. We've got our surveyors'
results on the science block.

1:03:06.039 --> 1:03:09.319
Now, then, Mr Devonshire, our structural
engineers have been over this.

1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:12.800
Greenhill's survey is complete fiction.
Nothing wrong with that building.

1:03:12.839 --> 1:03:16.360
Which begs the question, did
Jamie Marshall know about that?

1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:19.839
Listen to me. I was nowhere
near that building!

1:03:22.479 --> 1:03:26.079
Do you mean the building at the centre
of a multi-million-pound swindle?

1:03:26.119 --> 1:03:31.239
The building from which a young, ambitious
investigative journalist fell to his death?

1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:35.879
Now if you were me, and you once
were me, what would you make of that?

1:03:37.439 --> 1:03:40.680
I'd never heard of Jamie
Marshall until this happened.

1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:43.519
Don't you underestimate me, love.

1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:54.039
Mark.

1:03:56.479 --> 1:03:57.920
Ma'am?

1:03:57.959 --> 1:04:03.239
We need more. Go back through
Jamie's computer, his hard drive.

1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:06.000
And what about his phone records?
Why aren't they on my desk?

1:04:06.039 --> 1:04:08.079
We're still waiting on
the network provider.

1:04:08.119 --> 1:04:14.839
Now if Jamie was onto this fraud,
and I think he was, I need proof.

1:04:16.479 --> 1:04:18.720
- I need proof, love.
- Yes, ma'am.

1:05:04.319 --> 1:05:05.519
Hello?

1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:10.800
'Were you ever struck by the similarities
between Jamie's family and Rory Marston's?'

1:05:10.839 --> 1:05:14.519
I suppose so, if you exclude poverty,
alcoholism, drug addiction...

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.600
'One, absent mother.'

1:05:16.639 --> 1:05:18.879
Two, brought up by the father.

1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:22.759
And three, both with
vulnerable younger sisters.

1:05:23.879 --> 1:05:26.439
That's a bit odd, that, isn't it?

1:05:29.639 --> 1:05:31.920
Could try a little nip of malt.

1:05:31.959 --> 1:05:34.920
Yeah, I think you'll find you get
put in prison for that these days.

1:05:34.959 --> 1:05:39.600
Hm. There's Jamie's mood
board, full of happy families.

1:05:39.639 --> 1:05:43.400
'Yeah, I suppose so.
He's jealous. So what?'

1:05:43.439 --> 1:05:45.000
Yeah, well, maybe he was.

1:05:45.039 --> 1:05:49.159
I mean, Rory's this golden boy, isn't he?

1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:53.959
He's got everything in
life that Jamie wanted.

1:06:04.400 --> 1:06:06.159
'Are you still there?'

1:06:13.119 --> 1:06:17.519
- Ma'am? - Lucy Curran. She's
Rory Marston's girlfriend.

1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:19.519
How did we not know that?

1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:23.039
Of course Jamie and Rory knew each other.

1:06:23.079 --> 1:06:25.879
They... They met through me.

1:06:25.920 --> 1:06:27.800
When was that?

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:32.600
When I first started going out with Rory,

1:06:32.639 --> 1:06:34.920
about a year ago.

1:06:34.959 --> 1:06:36.560
So, through you,

1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:40.079
Rory and Jamie would have spent quite
a lot of time in each other's company?

1:06:40.119 --> 1:06:43.159
Ah... yes. I suppose.

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:48.879
Only, when we spoke to Rory,
he told us he didn't know Jamie.

1:06:50.479 --> 1:06:55.159
And he certainly didn't tell us that
Jamie was his girlfriend's best friend.

1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:57.400
Now why would he keep that from us?

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:04.400
Is Rory the jealous type?

1:07:04.439 --> 1:07:07.519
No, I... wouldn't say that.

1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:09.439
Look, I'm going to have to ask, love,

1:07:09.479 --> 1:07:12.680
was there something going
on between you and Jamie?

1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:15.239
No. There wasn't. Ever.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.680
Maybe Rory got a sense of
this and he was jealous.

1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:21.360
No. Rory didn't like Jamie.
He didn't not like Jamie.

1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:25.319
He was... indifferent to Jamie.

1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:28.039
No-one was indifferent to Jamie.

1:07:28.079 --> 1:07:31.800
He made his mark wherever
he went. He got noticed.

1:07:31.839 --> 1:07:35.319
And you're telling me, after all
that time they spent together,

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:39.920
Rory didn't notice
Jamie, he was indifferent?

1:07:39.959 --> 1:07:41.959
Yes.

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.519
When did you last see Rory, love?

1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:48.039
Monday night. He came to my place.

1:07:48.759 --> 1:07:50.959
And what time was that?

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.119
About midnight.

1:07:53.159 --> 1:07:56.319
After you'd been through
Jamie's flat and talked to me.

1:07:56.360 --> 1:07:58.239
And how did Rory seem?

1:07:58.280 --> 1:08:00.200
He was... upset.

1:08:00.839 --> 1:08:05.600
Upset? But you just told me upstairs
that he was indifferent to Jamie.

1:08:05.639 --> 1:08:09.839
- Because... he was upset for me. - Oh.

1:08:09.879 --> 1:08:14.239
Rory takes things to heart, you
know? He was... He was crying.

1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:17.400
We just held each other and...

1:08:17.439 --> 1:08:21.560
He knew how much I cared for Jamie,
so he was upset for me, I guess.

1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:24.079
Crying?

1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:29.959
- Mark. Jamie's phone records.
- Yes, ma'am. I've got them.

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.239
- Finally.
- Yeah, but there's nothing in there

1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:35.039
about Tyneford Estates,
Greenhill or Devonshire.

1:08:35.079 --> 1:08:38.560
I mean, as an investigative journalist,
he might have used a pay-as-you-go.

1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:41.119
Well, we don't have that.
I want to see the texts.

1:08:41.159 --> 1:08:44.959
Ah, well, that's where it gets
interesting. They're the most recent.

1:08:46.119 --> 1:08:48.119
I'm right.

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:53.720
Rory Marston and Jamie Marshall
were in a relationship.

1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:11.560
We'll have to monitor your kidney function

1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:14.600
but you must continue
with the immunosuppressants

1:09:14.639 --> 1:09:17.039
and I think you'll recover extremely well.

1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:21.280
Thanks. Thank you so much.

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.879
I'll leave you to it.

1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:25.720
You're going to be OK, Jenny.

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:59.879
- Your daughter on the mend?
- Yes.

1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:03.000
Well, that's good news, Alan. That's good.

1:10:03.039 --> 1:10:08.479
But we need to talk to Rory, about
your relationship with Jamie Marshall.

1:10:08.519 --> 1:10:11.920
- Vera...
- It's OK, Dad.

1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:23.959
We've seen his texts, Rory.

1:10:25.439 --> 1:10:29.079
All last weekend, wondering
why you dumped him,

1:10:29.119 --> 1:10:31.200
wanting to meet and talk,

1:10:31.879 --> 1:10:33.439
saying how much he loved you,

1:10:33.479 --> 1:10:35.839
didn't understand why you dumped him.

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:42.079
Now, because you ignored him,
he got angry, drunk and angry,

1:10:42.119 --> 1:10:44.680
- and went to meet you
out at the Priory. - No.

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:49.200
- That's not right. I didn't see him on Monday.
- So why did he go out there?

1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:54.079
He had a lot of things
going on in his head and...

1:10:54.119 --> 1:10:56.000
and he was a bit intense, and...

1:10:56.039 --> 1:10:58.839
I couldn't deal with it and
Jennifer was ill, so...

1:10:59.439 --> 1:11:01.119
.. I ended it.

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.239
After that, I couldn't face him.

1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:09.159
You shouldn't have lied to us.

1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:13.879
I didn't want Lucy to get hurt.

1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:16.839
Now, we know Jamie had
been distant with Lucy.

1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:22.600
Maybe he wanted to tell your
girlfriend the truth, come clean.

1:11:23.519 --> 1:11:28.479
Is that how the pair of you ended up
on that building? Hm? Arguing about it?

1:11:28.519 --> 1:11:32.280
He's drunk, a loose cannon,
things got out of hand?

1:11:32.319 --> 1:11:34.000
- No! That's wrong.
- Is it?

1:11:34.039 --> 1:11:35.959
That's all wrong.

1:11:39.519 --> 1:11:42.639
You can't prove anything.

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:46.000
You're your father's son, right enough.

1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:51.839
Now, there's a pattern here, Rory.

1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:57.039
Every time you lie to me,
I find out the truth.

1:11:57.759 --> 1:12:00.479
So I'll ask you again.
This is your last chance.

1:12:00.519 --> 1:12:05.479
Did you see Jamie at
Stephenson Priory on Monday?

1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:09.920
No.

1:12:11.639 --> 1:12:13.519
OK.

1:12:18.319 --> 1:12:20.839
Derek Stoddart's regained consciousness.

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:36.319
Can you remind me when
you last saw your son?

1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.360
Before he went to uni. Years ago.

1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:45.600
Only we know you saw him
just hours before he died.

1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:49.360
Your prints are all over the door.

1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:52.800
And we've got a witness who saw
and heard you shouting at him.

1:12:53.159 --> 1:12:55.560
So why were you threatening Jamie?

1:12:56.239 --> 1:12:58.759
Was it because he wanted you to own up,

1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:03.119
take responsibility for killing
Nicky Holland? Is that it?

1:13:03.159 --> 1:13:05.239
I don't know what you're on about.

1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:09.039
Well, you did kill Ian Holland's
son, didn't you? Hit-and-run.

1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:13.319
So this argument with Jamie...

1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:17.600
did you go up to the Priory later
on and lamp him one, and he fell?

1:13:17.639 --> 1:13:19.639
- No.
- No?

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:22.000
Where were you between
6pm and 8pm on Monday?

1:13:22.039 --> 1:13:24.720
Home, passed out.

1:13:24.759 --> 1:13:26.920
Find me anyone that tells otherwise.

1:13:26.959 --> 1:13:31.039
Ah, that's what you rely on, is it? No
witnesses, apart from your son, of course.

1:13:31.079 --> 1:13:34.600
That's how you got away
with killing Nicky Holland.

1:13:34.639 --> 1:13:37.680
Your son was ashamed of
you for not owning up.

1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:41.360
Invented a whole new family for himself.

1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:45.239
Well, something nasty must have
happened for him to do that.

1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.560
Mr Stoddart, did you kill Nicky Holland?

1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:54.879
- No. I didn't.
- Well, I think you did.

1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:58.800
And the one person who saw
you do it is also dead.

1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:01.839
Did you kill him, too?

1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:05.959
No.

1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:17.280
Right, CPS are happy.

1:14:17.319 --> 1:14:20.239
We've got enough to charge
Devonshire and Greenhill with fraud.

1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:23.319
Good. Just got to prove Jamie
knew what they were up to.

1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:25.039
Motive.

1:14:26.519 --> 1:14:29.639
- I need to speak to someone!
- You need to rest.

1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:32.200
- Can you listen to me?
- Is that Jennifer?

1:14:33.839 --> 1:14:37.159
- Who's in charge?
- Come on...

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:41.400
I'm in charge, love. DCI
Stanhope. What's the matter?

1:14:42.479 --> 1:14:44.800
This is the guy that turned up in my room.

1:14:47.439 --> 1:14:50.759
- When?
- Before my op.

1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:52.439
Monday.

1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:58.119
Rory. Call me back as
soon as you get this.

1:14:58.159 --> 1:15:00.159
Please.

1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:36.839
Rory?

1:15:36.879 --> 1:15:39.039
I thought it was the medication.

1:15:39.079 --> 1:15:42.439
But, you know, he was just
standing there, staring at me.

1:15:42.479 --> 1:15:44.879
And it was definitely this lad?

1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:47.280
Did he say what he wanted?

1:15:47.319 --> 1:15:49.319
He was looking for Rory.

1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:54.639
He just had this look of
complete hate on his face.

1:15:55.519 --> 1:15:59.759
I mean, I don't know if he was
trying to scare me but I was scared.

1:16:00.519 --> 1:16:02.360
He was drunk.

1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:04.600
Did you tell your family?

1:16:04.639 --> 1:16:06.800
Of course.

1:16:06.839 --> 1:16:08.560
I phoned Rory.

1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:11.400
And you told Rory this
fella was frightening you?

1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:16.560
- And what did he say? Was he angry?
- Yeah, of course.

1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:19.959
He said he'd talk to him that evening.

1:16:20.959 --> 1:16:24.759
But he can't have done, cos
that's when the boy died.

1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:31.360
So you're telling me that Rory
intended to confront this fella.

1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:34.319
No. Rory would never hurt anyone.

1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:43.800
Kenny? I need you to find
Rory Marston and bring him in.

1:16:43.839 --> 1:16:45.479
'What's the charge, ma'am?'

1:16:45.519 --> 1:16:48.800
Well, what do you think? The
murder of Jamie Marshall.

1:16:51.039 --> 1:16:54.319
Rory, you need to stop running.

1:16:57.039 --> 1:16:59.200
You can't run from this, son.

1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:02.720
I'm here for you...

1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:06.200
.. but you can't do this on your own.

1:17:08.959 --> 1:17:12.159
'I love you, no matter what.'

1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:05.959
He's not here. I don't know where he is, but
something's happened between him and Lucy.

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.360
Ma'am, he's not answering his phone. They've
tried all around here, his dad's house. Nothing.

1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:13.400
- Well, have we spoken to his dad?
- Yeah. Says he's no idea.

1:18:13.439 --> 1:18:15.039
Huh. Course he hasn't.

1:18:25.879 --> 1:18:29.119
Lucy? What's happened?

1:18:31.479 --> 1:18:34.680
Look at me, pet. What's happened?

1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:39.639
It was all lies, wasn't it?

1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:43.759
- Did Rory hurt you at all?
- He told me the truth,

1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:49.239
about him and... Jamie.

1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:53.800
He said the lies were over
and the truth had to come out.

1:18:56.159 --> 1:18:57.959
He wasn't making any sense.

1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.239
He looked like he was going to lash out.

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.439
Lucy, you have to tell me everything.

1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:06.159
He said he didn't mean
it. Jamie just fell.

1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:10.000
He told you he saw Jamie that night?

1:19:11.639 --> 1:19:17.280
He just kept saying it was an accident and
Jamie just fell because he was drunk and...

1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:20.360
You need to find him.

1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:22.560
- Please, you need to find him.
- We will.

1:19:23.560 --> 1:19:25.239
If he loved Jamie...

1:19:27.239 --> 1:19:29.439
.. why would he hurt him?

1:19:32.519 --> 1:19:35.639
Right, so we've got Rory
admitting to Lucy that he did it.

1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:39.680
- Well, that's uncorroborated.
- Yeah, I know, but he's our best bet for this.

1:19:39.759 --> 1:19:44.280
All the circumstantial evidence, all the
hearsay, does point to him, doesn't it?

1:19:45.039 --> 1:19:47.039
But we've got an opportunity here.

1:19:47.079 --> 1:19:49.639
He's unstable, he wants to talk.

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:51.680
All we've got to do is find him.

1:19:52.479 --> 1:19:54.519
Well, there is one place
we haven't looked.

1:19:54.560 --> 1:19:58.800
Ma'am? We just recovered
this from Jamie's laptop.

1:20:03.839 --> 1:20:06.680
We've got to find that lad
before his father does.

1:20:17.519 --> 1:20:19.519
There he is.

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.479
Get an ambulance here, now.

1:20:25.319 --> 1:20:28.800
- Shall I seal off the area?
- It's a bit late for that, love.

1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:34.000
Mr Marston.

1:20:34.039 --> 1:20:36.600
Mr Marston, it's all under
control. We'll deal with it.

1:20:36.639 --> 1:20:39.560
- No. He's my son.
- I'm sorry, sir. I can't let you through.

1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:43.680
Vera. He needs his dad.

1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:45.319
Oh, go on.

1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:54.920
Rory? Rory!

1:20:55.920 --> 1:20:57.800
Alan, don't frighten him.

1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:02.519
Rory.

1:21:04.239 --> 1:21:07.079
Just... Just come away from the edge, eh?

1:21:09.759 --> 1:21:14.519
Do as your dad says, Rory.
You need to face this.

1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:17.600
- Let's get you home.
- The boy's got something to get off his chest.

1:21:17.639 --> 1:21:20.200
You can't do this, Vera,
and you know you can't.

1:21:20.239 --> 1:21:22.879
He's already confessed to another witness.

1:21:23.879 --> 1:21:25.360
Confessed what?

1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:29.720
What is it you want to tell us, Rory?

1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:33.439
Rory, please. Don't say another word.

1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:37.920
It's all my fault.

1:21:37.959 --> 1:21:40.959
If I hadn't hurt him, none
of this would have happened.

1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:45.200
Jennifer told us you were looking for
Jamie, so did you find him up here?

1:21:45.239 --> 1:21:48.200
The pair of you got
into a fight? Is that it?

1:21:48.239 --> 1:21:50.239
No.

1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:52.959
- He fell.
- How do you know that?

1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:55.200
Were you up here with him?

1:21:56.319 --> 1:22:00.000
You're trying to get him to
incriminate himself under duress.

1:22:00.039 --> 1:22:01.759
OK.

1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:08.439
Early hours of Tuesday
morning last week... Alan,

1:22:08.479 --> 1:22:10.479
where were you?

1:22:11.479 --> 1:22:13.119
I'm sorry?

1:22:13.159 --> 1:22:15.039
It's a simple question.

1:22:15.079 --> 1:22:19.200
Early hours of Tuesday morning,
last week, where were you?

1:22:20.280 --> 1:22:23.079
Manchester. Overnight, on business.

1:22:23.119 --> 1:22:27.720
Mm. So did you invite Jamie
into your dad's house that night?

1:22:27.759 --> 1:22:31.639
And did he ask to look
at your dad's things?

1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:33.680
You never told me this.

1:22:37.839 --> 1:22:40.039
Dad, I'm sorry.

1:22:40.959 --> 1:22:43.759
I asked him to stay and then...

1:22:43.800 --> 1:22:47.920
then I woke up and I found
him creeping round the house.

1:22:49.439 --> 1:22:54.600
He was there for a
reason, wasn't he, Alan?

1:22:55.400 --> 1:22:57.600
I don't know what you're talking about.

1:22:57.639 --> 1:22:59.800
Tyneford Estates.

1:22:59.839 --> 1:23:03.959
See, Jamie was putting
together a newspaper story

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.439
exposing a scheme to defraud the
university out of millions of pounds.

1:23:09.479 --> 1:23:11.360
DS Healy?

1:23:12.439 --> 1:23:15.280
We retrieved these files
from Jamie's hard drive.

1:23:15.319 --> 1:23:18.800
Photos of documents tagged
at 2am last Tuesday.

1:23:18.839 --> 1:23:21.720
All the usual smoke and mirrors.

1:23:21.759 --> 1:23:27.800
Shell companies, dummy
investments, offshore trusts.

1:23:28.479 --> 1:23:31.159
But what Jamie found in your house

1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:35.519
proves that you're an
investor in Tyneford Estates.

1:23:38.519 --> 1:23:40.200
That's not true.

1:23:40.239 --> 1:23:42.959
Ah, come on, Alan. You
know this implicates you.

1:23:43.200 --> 1:23:45.680
Jamie was going to
expose the whole scheme.

1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:49.000
He was going to make people pay.

1:23:49.039 --> 1:23:52.759
Jamie fell, Dad.

1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:56.079
OK. Look, this has gone far enough.

1:23:56.119 --> 1:23:57.720
It stops now.

1:24:00.079 --> 1:24:01.759
My son needs help.

1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:05.319
You said he was drunk and he fell!

1:24:08.759 --> 1:24:13.639
Rory, are you saying your
dad was up here with Jamie?

1:24:15.959 --> 1:24:17.959
Jamie fell.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:21.519
Rory, the only thing we
know about Jamie's death

1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:26.280
is that he was punched
immediately before he fell.

1:24:26.319 --> 1:24:29.319
No... Dad?

1:24:31.959 --> 1:24:34.920
Dad?

1:24:34.959 --> 1:24:37.600
You've got no witnesses.
You can't prove anything.

1:24:37.639 --> 1:24:41.200
Oh, I have motive and
now I've got your boy

1:24:41.239 --> 1:24:44.879
- confirming you were up here with our victim.
- He didn't actually see me come up here.

1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:47.119
You haven't got a single eyewitness.

1:24:47.159 --> 1:24:49.079
You know I'm going to
pin this on you, Alan.

1:24:49.119 --> 1:24:54.239
I'll turn your life, your house,
your whole world upside down.

1:24:55.519 --> 1:24:57.560
Your son's been lying for you.

1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:02.720
You can't leave him like that, Alan,
knowing you killed the lad he loved.

1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:08.280
You need to tell the truth, Alan.

1:25:08.319 --> 1:25:10.280
Not to me.

1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:13.000
To your boy.

1:25:41.639 --> 1:25:44.519
Jamie got me to meet him up here.

1:25:45.479 --> 1:25:48.400
It was OK, he said, the
building wasn't dangerous...

1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:53.200
.. and he could prove it.

1:25:57.159 --> 1:26:01.959
I tried to buy him off. He
didn't want money, he said.

1:26:03.639 --> 1:26:05.920
He wanted justice.

1:26:08.039 --> 1:26:10.039
And you, Rory.

1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:16.000
But the more he talked,
the more he ranted.

1:26:17.839 --> 1:26:22.439
I realised it wasn't about
justice, it wasn't about you.

1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:28.759
It was really about our family.

1:26:30.439 --> 1:26:32.839
He was jealous of what we have.

1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:38.200
He wanted to destroy us.

1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:41.360
Me in prison, you and Jennifer alone.

1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:48.600
I couldn't stand the thought
that he might be using you...

1:26:53.759 --> 1:26:55.639
.. so I lashed out.

1:26:56.639 --> 1:26:58.439
I'm sorry, son.

1:26:58.479 --> 1:27:03.319
We need to be sure
beyond reasonable doubt.

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.720
I punched him, in the face.

1:27:26.839 --> 1:27:28.839
I punched him as hard as I could.

1:27:34.239 --> 1:27:37.600
Alan Marston, I am arresting you
for the murder of Jamie Marshall.

1:27:37.639 --> 1:27:40.439
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

1:27:40.479 --> 1:27:44.800
if you do not mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:17.200
He didn't mean for him to fall.

1:28:17.239 --> 1:28:20.360
- Do you believe him?
- Yes. I do.

1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:25.400
Allegation of fraud. He'll
wriggle out of that.

1:28:26.039 --> 1:28:28.600
It was the attack on his
family he couldn't stomach.

1:28:28.639 --> 1:28:31.200
- Can you finish up here, love?
- Yes, ma'am.

1:28:34.839 --> 1:28:37.079
Ma'am?

1:28:37.119 --> 1:28:39.519
400-metre champion?

1:28:40.319 --> 1:28:43.200
Aye. You'd better believe it!

1:28:46.519 --> 1:28:48.680
Hurdles!
