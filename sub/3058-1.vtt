01:50.110 --> 01:54.616
Stop! Stop! Stop!

02:19.931 --> 02:22.935
<i>Sheriff Agati, contact Border Patrol.</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:25.980
<i>Three possible illegals bearing
straight north.</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:03.813
Do you have any more
fragile in there?

03:03.975 --> 03:06.319
- No, senora.
- No?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.651
- No, that's the last of it.
- Okay.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.697
Goes right through
to the back on the left.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.286
Second door.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.406
Thanks.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.288
You guys want a pop?

03:20.450 --> 03:21.497
No, thanks.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.378
You can leave that
right in the middle there.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.008
Careful, it's fragile.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.622
Morning, Sheriff.

03:59.781 --> 04:04.287
You have no right to arrest
illegal immigrants.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.047
The law is the law.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.049
Any of you have a badge?

04:12.878 --> 04:14.972
<i>Okay, los bajo.</i>

04:18.759 --> 04:20.726
You may not speak to illegals.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.354
You may not touch them,

04:22.512 --> 04:24.685
you may not point any
kind of weapon at them.

04:24.848 --> 04:28.648
And you absolutely
may not fire on them.

04:29.853 --> 04:32.231
All you're allowed to do
is alert the Border Patrol.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.367
You can't break the law
to enforce the law.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.825
I could arrest
every single one of you.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.340
- Get some water for these fellas.
- Yes, sir.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.012
And break this camp down.
Now!

05:05.055 --> 05:07.808
You got half an hour to pack
this up and get out of here.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.579
Morning, sir.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.327
How are you?

06:09.494 --> 06:13.340
I'm so happy to be
with you today, my son.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.801
- Thank you for coming.
- You are very welcome.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.929
You have taken the first step.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.303
And you are ready to go.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.731
Remember, redemption
is always possible

06:30.223 --> 06:32.521
for the man who desires it,
my brother.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.651
Now I know that
you can control your anger

06:36.813 --> 06:38.190
and your hatred.

06:39.274 --> 06:43.450
I wanted to give you this.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.535
It won't work miracles,

06:45.697 --> 06:49.873
however, it can help you
see better when it is dark.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.250
Thank you.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.087
And I want you to have this.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.797
This is the crescent.

06:58.960 --> 07:03.716
It means "light in the midst
of the darkness."

07:03.882 --> 07:06.055
As you had your difficult days,

07:06.384 --> 07:08.637
you will have your bright days,

07:08.803 --> 07:10.305
God willing, yet to come.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.692
You have done your time.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.650
You are going to be a free man.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.612
Don't ever be afraid
of your new life.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.080
Here, this is for you.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.204
Okay, you will take care now.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.167
Take care.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.906
Thank you.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.748
Agent Smith. Supervisor Jones
is expecting me.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.961
- Ah.
- Supervisor Jones?

09:42.123 --> 09:45.297
Please, call me Paul.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.803
Right this way.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.429
So why New Mexico?

09:48.588 --> 09:51.558
Well, it's warm, dry.
Peace and quiet.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.717
Ooh, I hope you find it.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.808
What, 360 days of sun,
are you kidding?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.472
Please, this way.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.058
Here's your office.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.603
Maria Perez, Emily Smith.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.238
Oh, pleased to meet you, Maria.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.148
Hi.

10:07.315 --> 10:11.741
So, what kind of reinsertion program
do you guys have here?

10:13.029 --> 10:16.784
I don't have the staff, money,
or time to be a social worker.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.669
Here's your badge, car keys.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.000
There are your case files.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.381
First one's in there, have fun.

10:24.749 --> 10:25.841
Thanks.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.530
Richard Wayne?

10:48.022 --> 10:49.365
Please.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.916
I'm Agent Smith and I'll be
taking care of you from now on.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.004
After you, sir.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.475
So we're not going to cause each other
any problems then, are we,

11:08.585 --> 11:09.837
Richard, hmm?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.882
No, ma'am. You're not going
to have any problems with me.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.717
Just look at me.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.978
I'm going to be dead soon, anyway.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.683
No.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.898
I got no urges.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.898
I couldn't get it up even if I tried.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.108
So why...

11:30.064 --> 11:33.113
So... So why can't I spend

11:33.276 --> 11:35.278
my last year of parole in Ohio?

11:35.445 --> 11:37.322
What's in Ohio?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.244
My family.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.711
That's all I'm asking for.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.965
I told that to the other guy
before he quit.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.926
He couldn't care less.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.796
Hmm.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.347
Well, I appreciate
your situation, Mr. Wayne.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.766
I'll see what I can do.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.806
Thanks, Miss Smith.
Thank you very much.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.480
Now you take care of yourself.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.363
Don't believe a word that comes
out of that old perv's mouth.

12:14.525 --> 12:18.371
Well, where's the harm
in sending him to Ohio?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.830
- All clear.
- He's all clear.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.235
Open it up.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.780
Mr. Garnett?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.999
I'm Emily Smith,
your parole officer.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.753
I'm here to transport you
to your post-release orientation.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.472
Check.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.632
2,800 for the work you did
while serving your time,

14:01.799 --> 14:03.392
and $200 in gate money.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.477
- You're ready to roll?
- Yes.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.314
Congratulations on your release.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.245
Thanks.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.241
I'm sorry.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.543
Or you're going
to go back to jail!

14:33.706 --> 14:34.707
That's it.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.169
Here's a swab.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.139
Take a seat, sir.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.402
So you've had five incarcerations.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.698
First conviction, age 11.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.779
Three more as a minor.

15:00.942 --> 15:03.195
You served 18 years
of a 21-year sentence

15:03.361 --> 15:06.581
for killing a sheriff's deputy
at the Mexican border.

15:07.865 --> 15:12.371
Your mother,
adoptive mother, lives...

15:14.580 --> 15:17.049
lives in Eddy County,
New Mexico.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.171
When was the last time
you had contact with her?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.135
My plate is full.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.845
Answer the question, sir.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.261
When did she last visit you in jail?

15:29.846 --> 15:30.893
She didn't.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.894
During your three years of parole,

15:37.895 --> 15:40.523
you may not leave Luna County
without written permission.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.365
You may not be in possession
of a weapon of any kind.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.404
Now, here is a list...

15:46.571 --> 15:47.663
Can you read, sir?

15:48.656 --> 15:51.375
This is a list of what qualifies
as a weapon.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.378
You may not have contact
with any known criminals,

15:54.537 --> 15:56.960
or any former criminal associates.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.379
You recognize this guy,
Terence Saldano?

16:04.130 --> 16:04.972
Yes.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.804
Stay away from him.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.136
Curfew.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.724
You may not leave
your place of residence

16:10.887 --> 16:14.107
between 9 P.M. and 6 A.M.
without permission.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.735
I'm also authorized to randomly
inspect your bank account

16:17.894 --> 16:19.396
and paycheck stubs.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.485
Let's get you
to your accommodation.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.827
Mr. Garnett.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.419
You have been given
a second chance at life.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.001
Take advantage of it.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.589
But let me remind you

16:42.752 --> 16:46.552
that one bad choice,
even a little one,

16:46.714 --> 16:50.139
I'm going to put you back inside
for those remaining three years.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.929
I hope you won't make me do that.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.312
I won't. Trust me.

16:54.555 --> 16:58.355
Oh, trust, sir, is something
you're going to have to earn.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.627
Here we are.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.253
It's at the top of those stairs.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.803
And Garnett?

17:34.887 --> 17:38.061
- Yeah?
- Get yourself a job.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.041
Hey, Salvador!

18:17.763 --> 18:18.764
Thanks.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.692
This one's more affordable.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.273
Like it?

22:03.572 --> 22:05.916
Employment Office, this is Jane.

22:06.075 --> 22:09.420
- You have a criminal record.
- Yes.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.751
That doesn't leave us
with too many options.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.712
How many men do you need?

22:16.752 --> 22:17.594
All right.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.849
They need help on a farm
near the border.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.095
Minimum wage, no benefits.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.223
It's okay. I'll take it.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.946
Here's the application
and the address of the farm.

22:37.565 --> 22:38.657
Thanks.

22:45.322 --> 22:48.952
Parole officers work for the state,
not for the county or the sheriffs.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.791
- What are we doing here?
- Let's face it.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.751
Garnett did kill one of his deputies.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.756
It'd make him feel better
for him to meet you.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.963
- That was Agati's deputy?
- Yep.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.753
He was sheriff 20 years ago?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.547
Yep, been re-elected five times.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.272
Welcome.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.478
Bill Agati.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.267
- Emily Smith, pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to see you.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.902
Nice to see you.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.152
Jones.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.939
Why have you been such a stranger?

23:18.647 --> 23:19.819
Sit down, please.

23:20.608 --> 23:24.112
So I understand you're the parole officer
for William Garnett.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.531
I am, sir, that's right.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.621
You've got your hands full

23:29.783 --> 23:32.662
trying to keep tabs on our friend.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.956
So I've been advised.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.669
Good, then, we're on the same page.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.793
He's a loose cannon.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.255
Now, with all due respect, Sheriff,

23:42.421 --> 23:44.765
Garnett was a model prisoner.

23:44.924 --> 23:49.646
Earned his G.E.D. and tutored
other inmates towards theirs.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.601
You know he converted to Islam.

23:51.764 --> 23:55.189
Yeah, I'm aware of all that.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.991
But for the time being,
I'm more concerned

23:57.061 --> 23:58.483
with earthly matters.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.069
I want to make myself very clear.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.201
Garnett represents a danger
to this community.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.705
And I have a responsibility
to alert the people

24:07.863 --> 24:10.491
that a convicted cop killer
and known drug dealer

24:10.658 --> 24:12.376
is back among them.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.707
You really think that's called for?

24:17.873 --> 24:20.046
Look, we both know
what's in this report.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.337
Now we need to talk about
what's not in it.

24:22.503 --> 24:26.724
No, I really don't think
that'll be necessary, Sheriff.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.010
I know what I have to do.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.515
- Do you?
- Absolutely.

24:36.141 --> 24:40.112
Listen, I appreciate
your concern, Bill, I do.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.945
But I've developed a certain
philosophy over the years

24:44.108 --> 24:45.610
that's proved pretty effective.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.781
And what exactly is that
philosophy, Miss Smith?

24:50.572 --> 24:51.744
Trust.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.543
Without trust, there can
be no chance of reform

24:57.705 --> 24:59.207
for anybody.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.178
Well then,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.763
if you decide you need my help,

25:10.926 --> 25:12.519
don't hesitate to call.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.268
And...

25:16.306 --> 25:17.899
thank you for stopping by.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.311
Thank you, Sheriff.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.824
Look, I know my wife
would love to meet you.

25:25.983 --> 25:29.032
We're going to be having
a celebration for a local hero

25:29.194 --> 25:31.037
just returned from Afghanistan.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.574
Why don't you and Jones come by?

25:33.741 --> 25:35.869
Well, thank you.
Look forward to it.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.207
Okay, then.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.412
Have a wonderful day.

25:38.579 --> 25:39.922
Thank you, Sheriff.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.756
Enjoy the view.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.183
Yah!

26:18.035 --> 26:19.378
Go!

28:34.463 --> 28:36.807
You're a cultured guy now?

28:37.966 --> 28:39.183
Sheriff.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.932
Sharia law?

28:46.975 --> 28:48.693
Jesus didn't do it for you?

28:52.314 --> 28:54.237
So, what do we call you now?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.534
Just chosen a new way of life,
that's all.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.908
Mm.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.957
So, what's your next caper?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.087
Live in peace.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.253
Start a family.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.389
Live in a little house

29:17.547 --> 29:20.221
with a little lawn
and a lawnmower.

29:21.385 --> 29:24.514
Wife, kids, neighbors.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.311
A fairy tale

29:27.474 --> 29:29.602
if I've ever heard one.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.655
Look, I'm on parole, so...

29:33.814 --> 29:36.658
nobody's going to listen to me
if I make a complaint.

29:37.651 --> 29:38.994
But I want to ask you...

29:40.028 --> 29:41.701
could you not harass me?

29:42.489 --> 29:44.787
The world's turned upside down.

29:46.410 --> 29:49.835
Still, it's good to see you showing
some respect for the law...

29:49.997 --> 29:51.590
for once.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.462
All I'm looking for
is a simple life, that's all.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.053
If you don't mind,

30:00.215 --> 30:02.309
I'd like to finish my dinner in peace.
Thank you.

30:05.554 --> 30:09.058
My deputy, he's dead.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.398
After he met you, there was
no more dinner for him.

30:12.561 --> 30:15.861
His little girl
never had dinner with him.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.491
The legal system is wrong.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.445
Eighteen years in prison?

30:21.611 --> 30:24.615
I'd say you got away cheap.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.001
Sorry about Sergeant Taylor.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.833
Really, I am.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.461
I'm sure you are.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.835
Welcome home, Willie.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.278
Excuse me.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.520
Oh, hi, honey.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.497
I ran into Garnett tonight.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.460
What's he look like?

32:06.299 --> 32:07.642
He lost some weight.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.747
Good morning.

32:34.411 --> 32:35.708
Have a seat, please.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.007
Hey.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.967
Thank you.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.641
What can I do for you?

32:48.300 --> 32:50.420
- I'd like to open an account.
- Sure.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.517
What type of account do you need?

32:52.679 --> 32:54.147
Checking.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.396
I will need your I.D., please.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.071
Here you go.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.526
Thank you.

33:02.689 --> 33:07.320
I need your name
and your signature here.

33:19.289 --> 33:22.008
Here's five temporary checks.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.420
That should be everything you need.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.009
I'm still trying to figure out
everything I need.

33:32.552 --> 33:35.522
But... I'll take the checks.

33:38.099 --> 33:42.149
If you need something else,
here's my card.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.158
- Teresa.
- Mm.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.528
Teresa Flores.

33:51.488 --> 33:52.910
- Adios.
- Thank you.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.132
Yes? Something else?

34:38.409 --> 34:39.326
Huh?

34:39.327 --> 34:42.831
Because I'm definitely
going to call you.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.645
William Garnett.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.403
Right here.
Go all the way from there.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.624
- I was going to give you a call.
- Yeah?

36:07.791 --> 36:09.213
Yeah. I got a job.

36:09.376 --> 36:12.380
Good for you. Where?

36:12.587 --> 36:14.009
The ranch.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.049
I got my work contract.

36:16.966 --> 36:17.967
Good.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.684
Telephone number, too.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.149
Great.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.187
Anything else?

36:29.479 --> 36:31.072
Yeah, I...

36:31.231 --> 36:33.734
opened up a banking account.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.035
Put in $1000.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.821
That's the account number
right there.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.785
That's it?

36:45.161 --> 36:46.708
I got a date.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.373
For next Sunday.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.917
A date? What, with a girl?

36:51.251 --> 36:52.924
You're joking, right?

36:53.086 --> 36:56.886
You sure are a fast worker,
Mr. Garnett.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.842
Where'd you meet her?

36:59.008 --> 37:01.306
At the bank, where she works.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.473
At the bank?

37:12.689 --> 37:15.568
Why? That a problem?

37:16.735 --> 37:19.739
No, not if you told her
about your past.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.248
What, you think I'm going
to get her to pull a job

37:22.407 --> 37:23.283
for me or something?

37:23.450 --> 37:27.956
Did you tell her you'd been
to prison and why?

37:29.581 --> 37:32.084
I was in a bank
to open up an account.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.877
I met a woman there.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.465
I liked her.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.130
She could've been anybody.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.140
She could've been
working anywhere.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.724
She could've been working
on the cow ranch.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.388
She could've been
shoveling cow shit.

37:44.554 --> 37:46.522
All I'm trying to do
is what you asked me to do.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.524
I'm just trying to live a normal life
like anybody else.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.683
Is that all right with you?
Can you let me do that?

37:50.810 --> 37:52.904
Just hold it right there,
not another step.

37:58.485 --> 37:59.702
All right.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.448
All right, I didn't mean to scare you.

38:03.615 --> 38:04.616
I'm sorry about that.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.744
Who's scared? Huh?

38:08.995 --> 38:10.338
Now, you sit down.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.047
I said sit down.

38:32.519 --> 38:38.447
Mr. Garnett, there is a line
that must not be crossed.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.578
Do you understand me?

38:44.572 --> 38:46.073
Do you?

38:49.244 --> 38:50.541
Yeah.

38:50.954 --> 38:52.331
Good.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.758
Tell her the truth.

40:38.311 --> 40:40.562
What brought you to Deming?

40:42.065 --> 40:43.738
You just opened a bank account.

40:47.236 --> 40:50.285
Okay. See, I spent a lot of time here.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.825
It's just... I just...

40:52.992 --> 40:54.539
been away for a while, that's all.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.254
And?

40:57.413 --> 40:58.585
Where did you go?

41:02.085 --> 41:03.211
Different...

41:04.754 --> 41:05.880
Mm-hmm.

41:18.851 --> 41:19.943
What's up?

41:21.229 --> 41:22.572
- What's up?
- Willie!

41:23.982 --> 41:25.148
Good to see you.

41:25.149 --> 41:28.244
- Good. Looking good, man.
- I'm good, yeah.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.863
I see you still balling.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.198
All right.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.742
Well, you look all right, man.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.290
Yeah, I've been waiting 18 years
for you to get out.

41:38.291 --> 41:40.377
You never got my letters.
You never responded.

41:40.378 --> 41:42.337
You know, I'm still
broken-hearted about that.

41:42.338 --> 41:44.960
Yeah, I was just trying
to get a new life.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.588
I mean, I love you, man, but...

41:46.754 --> 41:49.257
Seriously, I mean, I can't see you.

41:49.424 --> 41:52.428
I can't even be around you,
they can put me back in for three years.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.896
I got to go. All right.
It was good to see you.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.774
Can I get a beer
and a ginger ale, please?

41:58.933 --> 42:00.606
He don't want to talk to me?

42:00.768 --> 42:03.521
We're out of that.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.235
Just a bottle of water, then.

42:05.398 --> 42:08.527
Hey, there's no law that says
you can't run into people.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.787
I've been looking for you
for two days.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.614
I got to talk to you
about something, brother.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.283
<i>- No podemos.
- Como?</i>

42:16.284 --> 42:17.661
If I'm going to make it,

42:17.827 --> 42:19.907
I'm going to have to stay out
of all this, all right?

42:19.954 --> 42:23.040
I got something for you.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.333
<i>No necesito nada. Nada.</i>

42:25.334 --> 42:26.677
All right?

42:26.836 --> 42:28.634
I'm telling you, man,
you look good.

42:28.796 --> 42:31.140
It's good to see you.
Take care of yourself, all right?

42:31.299 --> 42:32.801
- Take care of yourself.
- Wait, wait, wait.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.390
You mean I got to beg to talk to you?

42:39.974 --> 42:41.726
Gary. Gary.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.270
Shut the fuck up, okay?

42:43.436 --> 42:44.983
Just shut the fuck up.

42:45.146 --> 42:46.693
Hey, my card.

42:46.856 --> 42:49.484
How can I reach you?

42:49.650 --> 42:51.698
I got your number, all right?

42:55.615 --> 42:56.832
Why you piss him off?

42:56.991 --> 42:58.914
Don't fucking do that again.

43:07.627 --> 43:08.970
Hey.

43:09.128 --> 43:11.176
Let's get out of here
and go somewhere private.

43:11.339 --> 43:12.556
<i>Si.</i>

43:14.967 --> 43:16.219
Another one, please.

43:21.891 --> 43:24.895
Gary, I'm going to go dance.

43:25.061 --> 43:26.608
Stay, Gary.

44:03.558 --> 44:05.686
I had a really nice time.

44:05.852 --> 44:07.320
Me too.

44:09.939 --> 44:13.239
Teresa, you know, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.738
Just wanted to tell you.

44:19.574 --> 44:20.996
You know I...

44:23.619 --> 44:26.042
I'm Muslim, you know.

44:27.957 --> 44:31.427
Well, all my family is Catholic.

44:31.586 --> 44:34.590
I guess it means I'm Catholic, too.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.576
But seriously, there is something
that I need to talk to you about.

44:55.234 --> 44:57.402
You know what, you got to go.

44:57.403 --> 44:58.370
You got to leave.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.621
- What?
- Leave.

45:00.573 --> 45:01.699
Bye.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.209
Vamos. Goodbye.

45:04.368 --> 45:07.247
This is not your business.
It's not your business.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.885
Afternoon, ma'am!

45:19.008 --> 45:22.103
You mind taking your hands
off my vehicle?

45:34.523 --> 45:36.821
A gentleman
doesn't yell at women.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.160
Hey, Chris?

47:09.702 --> 47:11.079
Could you turn that down?

47:13.748 --> 47:15.375
Ain't none you, bro.

48:20.940 --> 48:24.865
I'm not asking you to turn
it off, just down, please.

48:27.822 --> 48:29.870
What the fuck?
Get the fuck out of my room!

48:30.032 --> 48:32.034
What the fuck
are you doing with my TV?

48:32.993 --> 48:34.961
You Muslim nigger piece of shit.

48:46.465 --> 48:48.341
Fuck you!

48:48.342 --> 48:50.811
You're going to owe me
a new TV, asshole!

48:51.679 --> 48:54.057
Fuck you!
Did you fucking see that?

48:55.224 --> 48:57.058
Did you see that shit?

48:57.059 --> 48:59.778
He threw my fucking TV!
You saw that, right?

48:59.937 --> 49:02.907
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

49:03.065 --> 49:05.363
Fuck you, you owe me
a new TV, asshole!

49:06.318 --> 49:07.318
Fuck off!

49:23.627 --> 49:28.548
Okay, you guys.
Party's over. I'll deal with this.

49:28.549 --> 49:30.222
Back to your rooms.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.261
You hear me?

49:39.185 --> 49:40.562
You did this?

49:42.062 --> 49:44.565
Lost control, sorry.

49:46.525 --> 49:48.573
Step out into the hallway, sir.

49:53.782 --> 49:54.658
Back off.

49:54.825 --> 49:56.748
Turn around, face the wall.

49:56.911 --> 49:58.834
Put your hands behind your back.

50:00.414 --> 50:01.916
You can go back to your rooms.

50:02.958 --> 50:03.800
Shut the door.

50:04.543 --> 50:06.295
It's almost curfew.

50:11.383 --> 50:13.556
So this is what happens

50:14.637 --> 50:16.765
after, what is it, two weeks?

50:17.640 --> 50:18.857
I made a mistake.

50:23.687 --> 50:27.282
The sheriff came to Teresa's
house today to humiliate me.

50:27.441 --> 50:28.784
Wait a minute.

50:30.903 --> 50:34.703
Agati came to Teresa's house?
What for?

50:35.908 --> 50:37.706
I don't know.
You got to ask him.

50:47.253 --> 50:50.427
Is there anything
that I can do to fix this?

50:56.345 --> 50:57.767
Stay there.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.479
Don't move.

51:16.490 --> 51:19.539
Buy you another TV.

51:19.702 --> 51:21.873
Yeah, but the game
starts in an hour.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.303
He's still an asshole.

51:57.406 --> 52:01.206
Well, Allah says that
it's your lucky day.

52:01.368 --> 52:05.418
He's not pressing charges.

52:05.581 --> 52:07.254
Thanks to Allah.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.635
So here's the deal.

52:10.628 --> 52:13.302
You can either go back to jail,

52:13.464 --> 52:16.638
or you buy him a new TV.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.276
- $140?
- Yep.

52:29.438 --> 52:32.567
Ha. Let that be a lesson.

52:41.950 --> 52:44.874
Garnett, go back to your girl
and talk to her.

52:46.497 --> 52:49.091
Been 18 years since I really
talked to a woman.

52:49.541 --> 52:51.168
Tell her that, too.

52:54.380 --> 52:56.178
Tell her everything.

53:33.752 --> 53:35.095
Thanks for coming.

53:48.058 --> 53:50.186
I spent 18 years in prison.

53:55.566 --> 53:57.944
I killed a sheriff's deputy.

54:05.701 --> 54:09.376
I've been away
for half my life.

54:13.709 --> 54:15.086
<i>'An.</i>

54:15.252 --> 54:18.131
I didn't know how to talk
that well before I went in,

54:18.297 --> 54:21.841
and I don't know how
to talk that well...

54:24.178 --> 54:25.600
Now that I'm out.

54:26.972 --> 54:28.315
I make these mistakes, you know,

54:28.474 --> 54:32.024
just a stupid mistake.

54:37.524 --> 54:39.151
Why am I here?

55:05.886 --> 55:09.607
I have a simple life.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.226
And I am fine with this.

55:12.392 --> 55:14.315
I like to stay in this way.

55:19.942 --> 55:22.616
I live 10 years in this country.

55:24.530 --> 55:25.747
I got myself a good job.

55:25.906 --> 55:28.455
I took out a loan and bought
a small house.

55:37.125 --> 55:39.924
Maybe nothing
is so unique about this.

55:43.590 --> 55:44.933
But I am happy-

55:45.717 --> 55:47.811
And I intend
to keep it this way.

57:36.078 --> 57:37.079
Excuse me.

57:37.245 --> 57:38.747
Could you bring us
two cups of water, please?

57:38.914 --> 57:39.915
- Yes.
- Thank you.

57:48.799 --> 57:54.647
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America.

57:54.846 --> 57:58.441
And to the republic
for which it stands,

57:58.600 --> 58:00.648
one nation, under God,

58:00.811 --> 58:06.159
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.

58:07.901 --> 58:10.905
My friends, we are
here today to celebrate

58:11.071 --> 58:12.869
the return of a local hero.

58:13.031 --> 58:14.453
- All right.
- Yeah.

58:16.535 --> 58:19.960
Lieutenant Joe Corrales,
United States Army,

58:20.122 --> 58:22.545
was awarded
the Bronze Star for valor

58:22.708 --> 58:25.837
for actions taken
while under enemy fire

58:26.003 --> 58:27.721
in Afghanistan.

58:29.089 --> 58:32.468
Joe, your community,

58:32.634 --> 58:34.807
and your country
are proud of you.

58:34.970 --> 58:37.814
You epitomize
the American spirit.

58:37.973 --> 58:41.773
And its willingness
to defend and sacrifice

58:41.935 --> 58:45.940
to safeguard those principles
upon which she was founded,

58:46.106 --> 58:49.610
life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

58:49.776 --> 58:53.121
I am proud to stand here
with you today,

58:53.280 --> 58:55.157
and your family and friends,

58:55.323 --> 58:57.576
and the citizens of Luna County,

58:57.743 --> 58:59.666
to say, "Welcome home."

59:02.873 --> 59:04.234
Thank you for your service.

59:06.668 --> 59:08.921
Okay, it's celebration time.

59:09.087 --> 59:10.384
Enjoy. Everyone.

59:12.174 --> 59:16.975
Now to get everybody plenty
of food, plenty of drink.

59:21.016 --> 59:22.233
Nice to meet you.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.770
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, Sheriff.

59:24.936 --> 59:26.062
Glad you made it.

59:29.733 --> 59:31.861
Emily Smith, my wife, Sheryl.

59:32.027 --> 59:34.746
- Oh, very pleased to meet you.
- You too. Welcome.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.907
- Beautiful party.
- Nice to see you here.

59:37.074 --> 59:39.497
Thank you.
Could I have a word, Sheriff?

59:39.659 --> 59:41.252
- Please?
- Sure.

59:45.499 --> 59:47.297
It's about William Garnett.

59:53.548 --> 59:56.518
I'd like to be notified
the next time the sheriff's office

59:56.676 --> 59:58.849
is going to intervene.

59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.480
Intervene?

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:03.266
Poor choice of words.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.776
We can do our jobs, Sheriff,

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.939
without resorting
to harassment and humiliation.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:10.073
None of that has happened.

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:14.073
Garnett is trying really hard,

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:17.831
but if he feels cornered,
he's going to get in trouble again.

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:20.583
And surely, that's not what we want,
do we, Sheriff Agati?

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:23.245
It's a party. Have fun.

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:35.298
You went on a field trip?

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:37.676
Where to?

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.847
Sears Tower?

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:43.515
You go to the top?

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:46.185
Some trip.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:51.941
No, I'm just
sitting on the porch

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.030
having a beer,

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:56.445
looking at the stars.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.454
It's so beautiful, Dad.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.365
Really beautiful.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:06.672
Little late for you to be calling.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:10.292
Okay.

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:13.424
All right, Dad. Night.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:44.250
Mr. Garnett, congratulations,
you passed the whiz quiz.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:45.251
You're free to go.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.788
Oh, Ms. Smith?

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:48.955
Can I...

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.459
You got a problem?

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:52.751
No.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:55.929
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.973
Yeah. Want to step outside?

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.224
Thank you.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.690
So, what's on your mind?

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.905
Teresa wants me to move in
with her, and I do.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.611
Is that okay with you?

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:18.152
Don't you think
that's a little hasty?

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.071
No, I don't.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.833
That's a great machine.

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.459
Oh, you ride?

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.577
Well, maybe I do.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.546
Yeah, you do.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:32.457
Here. Write down her address.

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:33.796
I need to inspect her house.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:35.882
No problem.
No problem at all.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:43.601
Oh, and you're kicking that.
You know what you're doing, huh?

01:02:43.602 --> 01:02:45.432
You ride a bike, huh?

01:02:45.433 --> 01:02:47.681
- Yeah.
Mind how you go on that thing.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.187
You have a nice day.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.607
Hey, Mr. Wayne.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.987
I've spoken to my supervisor.
It's not good news, I'm afraid.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:04.121
You're going to have to spend
your last year of probation

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.249
here in New Mexico.
I'm sorry.

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:07.660
What?

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:10.295
After that, you can
go anywhere you want to.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.373
But you promised me.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:17.295
No. No, I said I'd look into it
and I did.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:22.845
I only asked to die
next to my family.

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:26.103
Mr. Wayne, it is not my call.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:27.638
I'm sorry.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.277
Then you did nothing.

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:36.029
I really tried.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:42.911
Fucking nothing.

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:37.248
Hey.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.347
You know them?

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:48.176
No.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.855
Ditch her.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.604
We can hang it...

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.771
there?

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.157
<i>Si.</i>

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.304
Mr. Garnett!

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:21.814
Hey!

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:24.604
How's it going?

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:27.189
I guess it's time
for the job report.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:28.854
I didn't get the message.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:35.404
But there's about 1,700 cows here.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.913
I work with about 200 of them.

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:41.827
I don't know all their names yet,
but I feed them,

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.711
water them,

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.122
clean up their crap.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.291
Not a lot of money.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.631
- Well, it's a job, right?
- Yeah, it's a job.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.057
And I'm out in the open air.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.103
How's your family?

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:04.310
I've told you before, Garnett,

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:07.444
no personal questions.
Off limits.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:13.899
Yeah, well,
since my personal business

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:17.361
is your business,
I guess I want to thank you.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:19.035
For your advice.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:22.328
Well, you're welcome.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:23.663
There it is, right?

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:26.045
There it is.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.799
So...

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:31.925
if you got anything, I got to...

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:33.131
No, you're good.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.546
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.321
Tell Terence I'm here.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:38.029
<i>Mira, Willie.</i> ..

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:42.121
Anchor-baby,
business is booming.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.408
Fucking wetbacks, man,
they pay me 7Gs

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.918
just so that the little ones
can be born on this side.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.794
Then shazaam,
the whole Beaner family

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:50.330
gets to come over and stay.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:53.921
We throw in a free car seat,
a free gift for mamacita,

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.177
goddamn,
I love being an American.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:59.298
I owe it all to you, Willie.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:02.725
You could've been a punk ass,
you could've ratted us out.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.010
Ed, Fred, and me.

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:06.930
But you stood by your family.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.769
And I owe you.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.433
That's what I came here
to tell you.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.398
I need you to know, Terence,
you don't owe me nothing.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.483
Willie, you spent
18 years of your life

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:16.272
living in total darkness.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:19.283
I'm willing to offer you
a lifetime of sunshine.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:22.449
Willie, you're not made
for cleaning shit.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.660
And the sheriff, man,
he got you in his sight.

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:27.245
He ain't never going to forgive you
for taking down his boy.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:29.752
Not until you're dead.
You know how he rolls.

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:32.539
You know what I'm going to do?

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:35.959
I want to send you
to a safe place, Mexico.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.503
Down there you'd be free.
You don't have to worry about

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:40.671
looking over your shoulder
all the time.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:43.432
Thanks for your concern,
but it's not necessary.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.810
I got a whole new path,
a whole new life.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.891
You know, this...
this new generation,

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:51.149
they have no code of honor,
no sense of responsibility.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:54.811
Willie, my people in Mexico,
they're stealing from me.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:57.730
I need you to go down there
and lay down the law.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:01.071
Put those bitches in their places
like you did that deputy.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.866
They're going to be
scared shitless of you.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:19.677
Besides Allah,
she's everything to me.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.964
Allah? Allah?

01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:23.927
What are you talking about,
Allah?

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:25.683
What is Allah
going to do for you?

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.685
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm your family, Willie.

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.312
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm your family.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.438
Okay, okay. No, no, no.
Look, look, Willie.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:33.850
Look, I didn't mean
to raise my voice.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:37.190
If you stay here,
they're going to hold you on a leash

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.445
for the next three years.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:41.778
And you know that sheriff, he's going
to try to do whatever he can

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:44.990
to send you back to prison.
Is that what you want?

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:46.574
Is that what you want?

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.123
I'm only going to say this to you
one more time.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:53.785
Stay away.

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:37.666
Probably got lost
or their smuggler left them here.

01:13:37.667 --> 01:13:40.257
Mm-hmm.
- Coyote got the kid.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:43.007
And that drag mark...

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.258
it was a baby.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:53.354
Horrible.

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.066
God damn it.

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:06.071
What's it going to take?

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.344
Sheriff!

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.095
Guess what, boss?

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:33.185
Your boy, Garnett,
he went over to see Terence.

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:36.018
- Good.
- You want to pick him up?

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.848
Parole violation,
another three years.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:42.353
Unh-unh. Let him enjoy
his little reunion tour.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:39.960
Morning, Joe.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.959
- How we doing today?
- Just fine, Sheriff.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:44.214
How about yourself?

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.751
- All is well, my friend.
- Good.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:49.261
- Things running smoothly?
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:54.925
What...

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:56.252
what brings you out this way?

01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:59.764
Just stopping by-

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.308
How's our new friend doing?

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:06.521
No complaints.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.736
Mm-hmm.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.254
Ain't it something though?

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:25.335
A guy kills a deputy.

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.717
And 18 years later, here he is,

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:32.130
out in the sun
like it never happened.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:34.514
Yeah.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.801
Well...

01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:39.854
what are you going to do, huh?

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.016
If it were me...

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:48.195
I'd do whatever I had to do
to keep the piece of shit

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:51.574
away from our kids,
our families.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:54.739
I wouldn't be laying down
no red carpet for him,

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:55.869
that's for sure.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.076
That ain't holy water
he's sweating there, Joe.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.708
I'd kick his ass
out of town altogether.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.457
Know what I mean?

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:10.967
Yes, sir.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.352
It's your home.
It's our home.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:24.811
I'll check back.

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.976
Say hi to your family.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:33.566
<i>Go.</i>

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:36.281
<i>Go.</i>

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:16.367
Hey...

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:19.574
can I see you in my office?

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:25.785
Don't bother.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:28.712
I know what you're going to say.

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.882
It's okay if I finish out the day?

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:34.506
Yeah, sure.

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:37.505
Thanks, thanks.

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:37.633
Why are you wrecking everything
that Garnett is trying to do?

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:40.795
Nice to see you, Emily.

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:43.889
- Can I offer you a drink'?
- No.

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:47.427
- Maybe a Scotch this time.
- This is not a social call.

01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:48.719
I never would've known.

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:51.230
Why'd you get him fired, huh?

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.857
He's broken no laws. None.

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:57.065
You're letting your paranoia
run away with you, Sheriff.

01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:59.650
Whoa. Back the truck up.

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:02.407
We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:05.035
You understand me'?

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:06.828
Maybe you haven't noticed.

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:09.740
I don't just come into work,
twiddle my thumbs,

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:12.205
and wait for something bad
to happen.

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.245
You get the message?

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:17.164
The state granted him parole.

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:20.050
The state did. I didn't.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.632
Well, that's not
your prerogative, Sheriff.

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:25.514
And it's my job to uphold
that decision

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:28.141
and make those 18 years
count for something.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.100
Eighteen years?
My deputy is still dead.

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:33.605
Oh, go blow it out your ass.

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:36.142
I offered you help,
if you recall.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:39.403
But you turned it down. You said
you could do it by yourself.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.404
So what do you do?

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.986
You set him up by the border

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:46.618
where he grew up running drugs,

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.154
shooting at cops.

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:53.618
Not the smartest thing
I've ever seen, Agent Smith.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:22:00.542
So was getting him fired,
Sheriff Agati.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:05.342
And if you continue to interfere
with William Garnett,

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:07.755
I'm going to file a complaint.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.224
Oh, phooey.

01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:13.100
You want to take that chance?

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:16.141
I don't take chances,
Agent Smith.

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:19.147
I think you would've noticed
that by this time.

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:23.530
That's not all I've figured out,
Sheriff Agati.

01:22:24.982 --> 01:22:26.484
Get out!

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:53.928
You got something for me?

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:56.601
This is what
we have available today.

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:58.982
We have something
at the truck wash.

01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:04.147
I guess that's
the only one I can do.

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:06.111
Okay, go ahead, sign in.

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:47.522
Mr. Wayne?

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:50.317
You there?

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:53.446
It's your parole officer.

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:56.828
Richard.

01:24:56.383 --> 01:24:58.263
<i>We're sorry,
but the person you called</i>

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:01.267
<i>has a voice-mail box
that has not been set up yet.</i>

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:02.522
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.109
Willie, I need to see you.

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:13.404
Come on, Willie.

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:34.012
Willie, por favor, you really
see yourself doing this?

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:37.140
I couldn't even get you to do this
when you were little.

01:25:37.299 --> 01:25:40.553
We used to pay kids on the block
more money than this

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:42.392
to clean our bikes.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:46.098
What about our sueno,
our dream?

01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:48.726
Huh? What about that?

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:51.401
You know, your god, Alang...

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:54.487
- Allah.
- Okay, Allah.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:56.527
He's messing with your head.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:26:01.244
Willie. Willie, we got so much more
that we could do together.

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:02.658
Look, just think it over.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.667
- Not for me.
- Think it over.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:05.793
- Rashid?
- Yeah?

01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:07.670
My shift's done.
Take this over for me?

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:10.499
<i>It looks spotless.</i>

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.043
You're a pro.

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:20.725
Willie! Willie!

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:43.536
Aaah!

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:13.900
<i>Driver, slow down.</i>

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:16.315
<i>Pull the bike over
to the side of the road now.</i>

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:32.422
Okay, Garnett,
let's get off the bike.

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:35.460
Get off the bike.
Get your hands up in the air.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.343
Step back towards my voice.

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:39.425
You've done this before.
Get on your knees.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.799
Go on. On your stomach.

01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:45.890
Hands to your side, palms down.
Cross your legs.

01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:49.056
Going a little fast today,
aren't we?

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:57.731
Okay.

01:27:57.898 --> 01:28:00.401
On your knees. Come on.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:02.360
Get up.

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.621
You got anything
that's going to stick me today?

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:07.704
Do you have anything
that is going to stick me today?

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:09.914
- No, sir.
- Don't you eyeball me.

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:13.668
Now, get up. Get up.

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:20.257
Mind your head.

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:26.010
Five-six, I have one in custody.

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:43.027
Open one.

01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:46.781
Now, you are going to face the wall...

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.866
until you hear that door close.

01:28:50.033 --> 01:28:51.580
Is that clear?

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:53.711
Hey, is that clear?

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:54.917
Yeah.

01:29:15.642 --> 01:29:17.519
Okay, Jones. Good night.

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:28.989
Let him go in the morning.

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:33.895
- I ain't going nowhere.
- Just shut up.

01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:36.853
Have you listened
to a word I've said?

01:30:37.015 --> 01:30:39.518
I've got to get you out of Luna County
before the sheriff

01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:42.779
locks you up for good,
but I can't just move you.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:45.157
I got to make a case
you have family there

01:30:45.315 --> 01:30:48.159
who'll vouch for you,
so I called your mother.

01:30:48.318 --> 01:30:49.758
- My mother?
- Yeah, I talked to her.

01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:51.158
- You called my mother'?
- I talked to her.

01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:53.039
She's expecting us.

01:30:53.198 --> 01:30:55.917
You don't know nothing
about my mother.

01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:57.544
And what about Teresa?
We're together now.

01:30:57.702 --> 01:30:59.102
What am I supposed
to do about that?

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:01.756
Teresa?
Well, if she really cares for you,

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:04.668
she'll follow you anywhere.

01:31:04.834 --> 01:31:06.086
That's how women are.

01:31:06.252 --> 01:31:07.925
Trust me.

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:09.844
I know.

01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:32.028
Hey, Ma.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:35.873
I got that.

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:40.662
You came from far away?

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.957
- Deming.
- Oh.

01:31:44.124 --> 01:31:45.922
You flew?

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:48.837
No, Ma, it's not that far.
We just drove.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.177
- Mrs. Garnett.
- Hello.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:52.841
Beautiful place you have here.

01:31:53.008 --> 01:31:54.009
Thank you.

01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:01.316
Well, the lady was nice
to drive you.

01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:04.361
Is that where you live now?

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:07.443
Yeah, for now.
I'm staying with my girlfriend.

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:09.858
- I got a girlfriend now.
- Oh.

01:32:10.025 --> 01:32:12.744
Yeah. I think you'd like her.
I'd like you to meet her sometime.

01:32:12.745 --> 01:32:13.737
Hmm?

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.961
- I had a scorpion in the house.
- Did you?

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:26.091
Yeah, but it was
entirely my fault.

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:28.502
I mean, I should've
seen it sooner.

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:29.544
Oh, you got him?

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:32.590
Yeah. It was
crawling all over the place.

01:32:37.594 --> 01:32:40.768
But you know,
they're dangerous.

01:32:42.766 --> 01:32:46.816
Now I worry about
what's crawling around when I'm...

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:49.398
when I'm sleeping.

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.402
You still doing that...

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.821
you know, that Irish dancing thing
you were doing?

01:32:55.987 --> 01:32:58.581
No, not so much anymore.

01:33:05.038 --> 01:33:06.255
Want something to drink?

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.257
No, thanks. I'm fine, thanks.

01:33:12.045 --> 01:33:15.299
I would've cooked something for you,
but it was such short notice.

01:33:15.465 --> 01:33:16.466
I said I'm fine, really.

01:33:16.633 --> 01:33:18.761
I didn't expect you
to cook nothing for me anyway.

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:24.065
Well...

01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:32.031
I mean, I wrote you all the time.

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:33.612
Did you get any of my letters?

01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:36.949
Yes, I did.

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:42.500
Did you read any of them?

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:55.005
I mean, it would've been nice
if you would've sent one to me.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:00.977
Why, Mom?

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.807
Why what?

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:10.111
Why didn't you
come visit me once?

01:34:10.728 --> 01:34:12.321
Just once.

01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:16.276
Do you want money?

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:17.989
- Because I can give you some.
- Come on, Mom.

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:20.281
- I don't have much.
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:24.200
I don't want any money.

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:25.744
I don't want nothing.

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:30.507
It's me.

01:34:32.292 --> 01:34:33.509
It's me, Ma.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.386
It's your son.

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:45.142
I couldn't.

01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:48.604
What could I say?

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:53.567
I didn't know what to say.

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:02.909
What is it you want?

01:35:07.452 --> 01:35:09.204
I know that this is...

01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:17.554
It's got to be really difficult
and uncomfortable for you.

01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:19.764
Me being here.

01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:27.722
You can't possibly know.

01:35:29.015 --> 01:35:30.358
Not easy for me either.

01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:34.066
Well, then, why are you here?

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:35.697
Just tell me
what you want from me.

01:35:35.855 --> 01:35:38.574
I don't want anything
from you, Ma. I just...

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.953
I just been wanting
to tell you something.

01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:51.917
Will you listen to me?

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:55.962
I'm sorry.

01:36:00.213 --> 01:36:03.513
I know that...

01:36:04.384 --> 01:36:07.308
that I made a lot of mistakes
and did a lot of things wrong.

01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:11.191
And I know that you tried.

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:14.310
But it's not your fault.
I mean...

01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:16.946
it's not easy to raise a kid.

01:36:18.523 --> 01:36:22.198
And I know that I let you down.

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:26.072
I'm really sorry for that.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:33.539
When the...

01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:36.754
when the judge
read the sentence...

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:40.970
I thought I was going to die.

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:46.597
But I was relieved, too.

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:51.268
I just couldn't...

01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:53.433
go back to all of that, Willie.
I couldn't do it.

01:36:53.599 --> 01:36:55.021
It would kill me.

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:59.823
That's why I didn't visit you.

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:04.945
I got it, Ma.

01:40:44.622 --> 01:40:46.062
- He never mentioned me to you?
- No.

01:42:33.939 --> 01:42:36.567
All right, there you are.
What's going on?

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:38.361
What?

01:42:39.111 --> 01:42:40.195
Teresa?

01:42:56.128 --> 01:42:57.801
Who did it?

01:42:59.256 --> 01:43:00.678
Terence.

01:43:19.819 --> 01:43:21.366
I'll fix this, all right?

01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:24.823
I'll be back.

01:43:24.824 --> 01:43:26.292
I'm going to fix this.

01:47:55.427 --> 01:47:56.804
Yeah, let's do it.

01:48:05.062 --> 01:48:06.905
Willie! Willie, no!

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.652
Aah!
