Agent Burke, you're hereby on leave
until this investigation is completed.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.766
Peter, your gun and your badge.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.242
What about Larssen?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.827
We can't hold him.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.295
Uncuff him.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.921
Hughes, you can't let him
walk out of here.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.591
Stay out of it, Caffrey. Uncuff him.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.384
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)

14:05.971 --> 14:07.723
I'll send you the bill for my door.

14:17.065 --> 14:20.652
Agent Burke,
you have to leave the building as well.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.542
-Boss?
-What happened?

14:38.462 --> 14:40.172
Larssen destroyed me.

14:46.637 --> 14:49.014
I knew that's where they'd go.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.850
No, we have to give them
everything they ask for.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.186
What do you got there?

14:54.269 --> 14:57.272
Oh, Mozzie's care package,
per his specific request.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.816
We've got gluten-free brownies
and bendy straws.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.902
He's definitely feeling better.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.487
Straws, though?

15:03.570 --> 15:04.780
(SIGHS)

15:05.781 --> 15:07.783
-We'll get through this.
-I know.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.584
That was Diana.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.795
Department of Justice
has pulled all my files.

15:19.878 --> 15:20.963
That was fast.

15:21.046 --> 15:24.132
Evidence tampering?
It doesn't get any worse than that.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.552
Every case I've closed
will be brought into question.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.221
Maybe I'll get my anklet off
sooner than I thought.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.181
You might.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.684
How the hell did Larssen plant my print?

15:34.852 --> 15:37.187
He could've used
a photo-edged metal master of the print

15:37.271 --> 15:38.939
and used it to cast a latex positive.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.066
Okay, let me rephrase that question.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.485
Where the hell
did Larssen get my fingerprints?

15:43.569 --> 15:45.571
He didn't get it
out of your personnel file.

15:45.654 --> 15:48.866
The print on the gun
has detail outside the print on file.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.576
Did he get it from a doorknob?

15:50.659 --> 15:52.160
Nah, too many people touch it.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.454
He'd need a clean print,
preferably off a hard surface.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.792
What?

15:58.876 --> 16:01.837
My mug. It disappeared.

16:02.588 --> 16:05.340
You think Larssen's brazen enough
to walk into the FBI?

16:05.424 --> 16:08.719
If he was, we've got him on camera.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.434
I think I got something.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.853
This is the elevator lobby
from two nights ago.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.354
Is that Caffrey?

16:20.272 --> 16:21.773
No, wait a second.

16:21.857 --> 16:23.734
He doesn't walk like Caffrey.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.362
You don't think that's Larssen, do you?

16:27.446 --> 16:29.531
Try Camera B.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.742
Is he going to Peter's office?

16:35.621 --> 16:37.247
Zoom in. There.

16:38.624 --> 16:40.751
-That's the mug.
-Hold on, hold on.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.377
Go back ten seconds on B.

16:42.461 --> 16:43.629
(TAPE REWINDING)

16:43.712 --> 16:45.047
DIANA: I can't get
a clear shot of his face.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.924
He's playing the camera
angles with the hat.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.010
Yeah, but look behind him.
Look at the glow on Peter's desk.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.094
Desktop monitor.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.055
That wasn't on before he entered.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.598
He was on Peter's computer.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.937
Hey. Look, I know you and Peter
have been up to something,

17:00.020 --> 17:01.480
and I've been patient.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.565
I just need to know
what the hell is going on.

17:03.649 --> 17:05.817
Peter should be the one to tell you.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.079
Catch yourself cheating yet?

17:17.162 --> 17:19.331
I tried. My opponent's
always one step ahead of me.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.750
Imagine that. Look familiar?

17:23.085 --> 17:25.462
That's Larssen.
How'd he get past security?

17:25.546 --> 17:27.965
He used a maintenance pass.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.050
The guys at the booth are used to seeing

17:30.133 --> 17:32.302
a guy wearing a hat
walking into my office.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.263
He got onto my computer when he was there.

17:34.346 --> 17:35.347
What did he do?

17:35.430 --> 17:37.641
Well, he erased
all history of being there.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.978
Fortunately, I keep a secret
key logger on my computer.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.605
I have never appreciated
your distrust of me more.

17:43.689 --> 17:47.317
Larssen logged in
and erased something from his own file.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.446
There's a copy of his most recent file.

17:51.530 --> 17:54.366
And there's a copy of a few days ago.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.076
He erased the name Frederick Bilal.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.078
He's a Nigerian prince.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.663
Thought those only existed in spam e-mail.

18:00.664 --> 18:03.584
Bilal likes to race horses
internationally.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.336
He owns a number of shipping companies.

18:06.420 --> 18:10.132
And he handles a lot of import and export
out of New York Harbor.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.009
Where can we find His Royal Highness?

18:12.092 --> 18:14.469
He spends his days
at the Rogers Yacht Club.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.139
Rogers is pretty tough to get into.

18:17.723 --> 18:20.517
-Yeah, and I can't flash my badge anymore.
-You don't need one.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.228
I'll go in
as an upper-crust spoiled elite,

18:23.312 --> 18:26.023
I'll make a scene. Then you come in.
And you're pissed at me…

18:26.106 --> 18:29.026
The only options aren't
the law or the con, Neal.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.738
Hey, it's Peter. I'm calling in a favor.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.037
NEAL: Hope you got a plan, Peter.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.705
I do. I do.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.374
-Hello.
-Hi.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.001
MAN: Sorry, sir. Members only.

18:46.084 --> 18:49.338
They're with me.
Sara Ellis, Sterling Bosch Insurance.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.465
-Hi, Sara.
-Hi, Peter.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.967
Neal, it's been a while.

18:54.051 --> 18:56.970
Nice to see you fully clothed.
Love the hat.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.268
NEAL: So, you're a member?

19:03.352 --> 19:05.270
My company insures a number of yachts.

19:05.354 --> 19:07.147
-Thanks for the assist.
-I owe you one.

19:07.898 --> 19:10.776
That's our guy. Prince Bilal.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.903
Prince, huh?

19:12.986 --> 19:14.154
I've been a prince.

19:14.238 --> 19:15.864
-When was that?
-Yeah, when was that?

19:15.948 --> 19:17.908
-You want me to talk to him?
-Why you?

19:17.991 --> 19:19.535
Because of your situation.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.120
-What's wrong?
-You make it sound like I'm dying.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.207
Things are complicated at the FBI.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.585
But I don't need a badge
to do good detective work.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.796
-All right. What's your in?
-He likes horses.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.090
Keep an eye on his boat.

19:35.384 --> 19:38.554
It's like Superman without his powers.

19:40.806 --> 19:41.932
-How you doing?
-BARTENDER: Good.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.225
Turn on the horse races, will you?

19:43.308 --> 19:45.227
-Channel 12.
-Yes, sir.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.478
What?

19:47.688 --> 19:51.066
Puddle of Money
cost me 100 grand last time he ran.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.860
Well, that's what you get
for betting the chalk.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.153
Puddle will always feel the fire
on the home turn.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.031
-A racing enthusiast.
-Yeah.

19:58.115 --> 20:00.993
Thank God.
Everyone here just wants to talk sailing.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.661
(CHUCKLES)

20:05.622 --> 20:07.875
Clark Kent seems to be doing
pretty well for himself.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.042
What now, Boy Wonder?

20:09.126 --> 20:10.711
You're mixing your superheroes.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.588
God. And you're working guard duty.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.299
"Keep an eye on something"
is code between me and Peter. Okay?

20:15.382 --> 20:18.343
It means do some digging,
see what I can find.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.304
Does Peter know that's what it means?

20:21.221 --> 20:22.890
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

20:22.973 --> 20:24.683
So your company ships around the world?

20:24.766 --> 20:26.059
-We do.
-Mmm.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.313
Give me some advice.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.900
I have a couple horses
I want to race internationally,

20:32.983 --> 20:36.737
but the mandatory quarantine period
is killing my profits.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.780
Any way around that?

20:38.864 --> 20:40.574
What you're suggesting is illegal.

20:41.825 --> 20:44.536
So is giving you an inside track
on whether one of my jockeys

20:44.620 --> 20:47.414
is gonna be dragging the reins
in an upcoming race.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.252
-I'll check the logbook tonight.
-I appreciate that.

20:52.336 --> 20:53.545
(CHUCKLES)

20:53.629 --> 20:56.381
Mmm. Okay, here we go. Here we go.

20:56.465 --> 20:57.883
-(CHUCKLES)
-PETER: Mmm-hmm!

20:57.966 --> 20:58.967
ANNOUNCER: <i>And they're off!</i>

20:59.051 --> 21:01.428
-Come on.
-Come on. Come on.

21:01.512 --> 21:04.973
-Is that the captain of Bilal's yacht?
-Yeah. What are you thinking?

21:05.057 --> 21:06.475
Who's the owner of this club?

21:06.558 --> 21:08.477
-Frank Wellington.
-Does he come out here often?

21:08.560 --> 21:11.063
Rarely. I take it that's who you'll be.

21:11.146 --> 21:13.023
Only if you'll be my Mrs. Wellington.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.193
All right.

21:16.276 --> 21:19.071
Your wallet, please.
Marriage is based on trust.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.949
Ah. Trust that I have my baton,

21:22.032 --> 21:24.743
and I really do
love to hit people with it.

21:25.619 --> 21:26.912
Thanks.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.587
NEAL: Fifty bucks if you pop by

21:35.671 --> 21:37.464
and give this to that lady
in the blue dress right there.

21:37.548 --> 21:38.799
Say, "I found your…"

21:44.096 --> 21:45.889
You gave him my wallet?

21:45.973 --> 21:48.642
He'll give it back. Probably.
Follow my lead.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.313
-This is the yacht?
-It is.

21:53.397 --> 21:55.232
-Isn't it perfect?
-Yes.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.651
-Excuse me. Are you the captain?
-I am.

21:57.734 --> 22:00.195
I'm afraid we're unavailable
for charter until early November.

22:00.279 --> 22:04.825
Oh, no. My lovely wife, she's dead set
on this boat. Can we get a tour?

22:04.908 --> 22:07.661
Excuse me.
Mrs. Wellington, you dropped this.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.664
Oh. Thank you so much.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.792
She does have her moments.
Give him $50, won't you, sweetheart?

22:13.876 --> 22:16.295
-As a thank-you.
-Of course. Thank you.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.796
Thank you, ma'am.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.756
You're Mr. Wellington?

22:19.840 --> 22:21.967
You caught me. Call me Frank.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.094
I've met Frank Wellington.

22:24.178 --> 22:27.347
Well, I'm sure you have. I'm his son.

22:27.431 --> 22:29.183
Just call him Junior. Everybody does.

22:29.266 --> 22:31.059
Honey, what should we do now?

22:31.143 --> 22:34.188
Maybe I can convince someone
to give us their reservation.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.273
Who's taking her out next?

22:36.356 --> 22:39.026
I'm sure I know one or two of the names
in your logbook.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.777
(INHALES SHARPLY)

22:41.486 --> 22:45.115
You know, I would love to just ask you
a couple questions over here.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.575
-May I?
-First of all,

22:46.658 --> 22:49.328
how much do you think it would cost…
I know this is silly.

22:49.411 --> 22:52.247
But to paint the whole thing pink?

22:52.331 --> 22:55.209
CAPTAIN: Wow, um, you know, I'm not sure.

22:55.292 --> 22:56.793
Let me check on that
and I'll get back to you.

22:56.877 --> 22:58.420
SARA: Wonderful. Thank you so much.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.257
-He bit on the horse races?
-He did.

23:02.341 --> 23:05.427
Peter Burke, cowboy.
Why does that make so much sense?

23:05.511 --> 23:08.805
I grew up in upstate. Lots of horses.
You pick up a thing or two.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.098
Sara, thanks for your help.

23:10.182 --> 23:13.018
-Yeah. Thanks for the shotgun marriage.
-Anytime.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.522
-You want the good news?
-Sure.

23:16.605 --> 23:19.233
According to the log,
every time Larssen came to New York

23:19.316 --> 23:21.235
someone named Brian Blitek
rented his yacht.

23:21.318 --> 23:23.153
That's one of Larssen's aliases.

23:23.237 --> 23:25.656
Larssen comes to town,
smuggles something, then leaves.

23:25.739 --> 23:28.075
Something important enough
to break into the FBI to hide.

23:28.158 --> 23:30.118
-What's the next step?
-(SIGHS)

23:30.202 --> 23:33.789
Normally I'd get a search warrant
on the docks,

23:33.872 --> 23:37.084
do a wiretap and surveillance
on Larssen and Bilal

23:37.167 --> 23:40.003
and catch them red-handed
smuggling whatever it is they smuggle.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.339
What if we get someone else to arrest him?

23:43.549 --> 23:44.550
What do you mean?

23:44.633 --> 23:47.469
We can do all you mentioned.
We'll just do it my way.

23:49.179 --> 23:51.473
-A con?
-Nothing illegal. But if we…

23:51.557 --> 23:53.058
-All right.
-Just hear me out.

23:54.393 --> 23:55.853
I saw what you did there.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.147
If it means bringing Larssen down, I'm in.

24:00.399 --> 24:02.025
-Nothing illegal?
-Nope.

24:02.109 --> 24:03.402
How do we do it?

24:03.485 --> 24:04.820
First you'll need to form a crew.

24:05.654 --> 24:06.738
Burke's crew.

24:08.574 --> 24:09.950
Welcome to the other side.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.336
Thanks, Peter.

24:22.713 --> 24:23.839
Oh, I'm fine.

24:23.922 --> 24:25.299
You're gonna need it.

24:25.382 --> 24:27.217
Thanks for coming, Jones.

24:27.301 --> 24:30.596
Of course. I don't know why you kept me
out of the loop in the first place.

24:32.139 --> 24:33.265
To protect you.

24:33.932 --> 24:35.392
To protect me?

24:36.351 --> 24:37.436
From who?

24:37.519 --> 24:39.688
Julian Larssen's

35:51.151 --> 35:52.361
What can I do for you, Miss Ellis?

35:52.444 --> 35:54.446
Well, I just got a call from my client

35:54.530 --> 35:56.698
and he's being harassed
by Agent Peter Burke.

35:56.782 --> 35:58.534
-I'd like to file a complaint.
-Burke?

35:58.617 --> 36:00.577
-You're sure about this?
-Burke's there right now

36:00.661 --> 36:01.912
if you'd like to go see for yourself.

36:01.995 --> 36:03.497
Yeah, let's go.

36:03.580 --> 36:04.957
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

36:05.040 --> 36:06.834
Still think this is a witch-hunt?

36:06.917 --> 36:09.002
-I guess we'll find out.
-Yeah.

36:09.086 --> 36:11.046
What the hell's going on here?

36:11.129 --> 36:12.631
Peter needs our help.

36:17.135 --> 36:18.428
BILAL: What are you doing?

36:19.137 --> 36:22.015
Latex fingerprints for Agent Peter Burke.

36:26.478 --> 36:28.981
BILAL: They find Burke's prints
all over the guns.

36:29.064 --> 36:31.567
That's right.
He planted evidence against me…

36:33.235 --> 36:35.112
-again.
-(DOOR SLAMS OPEN)

36:35.195 --> 36:36.572
Hands in the air.

36:37.447 --> 36:39.741
I said in the air. Now.

36:43.787 --> 36:46.874
-What's that on his hands?
-Jones, check his hands.

36:49.835 --> 36:51.003
Latex fingerprints.

36:51.086 --> 36:52.921
I'll bet they match Burke's.

36:53.005 --> 36:55.257
Let's get the fingerprints into evidence.

37:02.556 --> 37:04.308
NEAL: Can we get a little farther away?

37:04.391 --> 37:05.976
My nose isn't bleeding yet.

37:06.059 --> 37:08.437
-Close enough.
-How's it going?

37:08.520 --> 37:10.189
We're about to find out.

37:13.358 --> 37:14.610
There it is.

37:32.669 --> 37:34.171
No. No, no, no.

37:34.922 --> 37:36.089
He's got Roe's gun.

37:36.757 --> 37:39.051
-All right, where's the car?
-Two blocks in the wrong direction.

37:41.762 --> 37:44.348
Officer, I need to borrow your horse.

37:44.431 --> 37:46.016

Nice riding, Butch.

Thanks, Sundance.

Thanks.

-Oh, it felt good though, didn't it?
-Oh, yes, it did.

Before you get your badge back,

39:11.351 --> 39:12.853
there is a seven-man con
that I've been meaning…

39:12.936 --> 39:15.397
No. The Burke Seven is hereby disbanded.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.024
We made a good team.

You enjoyed yourself.

39:22.196 --> 39:24.031
A good con never admits to anything.

39:24.114 --> 39:26.033
You taught me that.

I'm gonna call Moz,
give him the good news.

on shipping Nazi dinnerware?

40:02.694 --> 40:04.404
Not really, no.

40:05.531 --> 40:07.157
Larssen's not talking,

40:07.241 --> 40:09.701
but it's clearly important
to whoever he's working for.

40:10.661 --> 40:11.870
Where was it going?

40:12.579 --> 40:17.292
Argentina, which isn't exactly
in the FBI's jurisdiction.

40:17.876 --> 40:18.961
It's in mine.

40:20.420 --> 40:23.340

has a few clients in South America.

Are you offering to go to Argentina?

to metallurgy.

is to protect you from him.
