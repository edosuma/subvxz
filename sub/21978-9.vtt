01:11.203 --> 01:14.208
This waiting is getting on my nerves.

01:14.209 --> 01:16.345
Don't worry. 
It'll be over soon.

01:16.346 --> 01:18.450
And he'll be here any minute.

01:18.451 --> 01:21.022
And then we do what we do best !

01:21.023 --> 01:22.358
Yeah.

01:22.359 --> 01:24.829
Pizza !

01:25.832 --> 01:28.170
Good stuff, Michelangelo.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.940
Uh, master Splinter.

01:29.941 --> 01:32.745
I know you don't dig pizza.

01:32.746 --> 01:35.017
So I got you a sushi tray.

01:35.018 --> 01:37.522
It is thoughtful of you, Michelangelo,

01:37.523 --> 01:41.063
But I'm afraid I'm not hungry.

01:41.064 --> 01:42.833
He didn't want it.

01:42.834 --> 01:45.672
I don't blame him.
Raw fish !

01:45.673 --> 01:49.179
Splinter's been acting
mondo depressed lately.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.751
What do you suppose
is bringing him down ?

01:51.752 --> 01:54.690
He's probably worried about 
Shredder's next move.

01:54.691 --> 01:56.361
I don't think that's it.

01:56.362 --> 01:59.734
I think master Splinter
misses being human.

01:59.735 --> 02:02.139
Oh, I think you got it, bro.

02:02.140 --> 02:05.479
Like, wouldn't it be rad if we could 
grant him his wish ?

02:05.480 --> 02:08.451
Yeah, but a chemical that can change
a rat into a human

02:08.452 --> 02:09.687
Ain't easy to come by,

02:09.689 --> 02:11.291
even in this city.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.831
Hold it, guys.

02:14.832 --> 02:16.235
I think I've got just the thing.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.370
Follow me.

02:19.575 --> 02:21.845
Guess what this is.

02:21.846 --> 02:24.184
Well, it's either a very old pizza

02:24.185 --> 02:25.921
or it's what's left of the wicked witch
of the west.

02:25.922 --> 02:29.061
Wrong. This is all that's
left of the mutogen

02:29.062 --> 02:31.065
that changed us from ordinary turtles

02:31.066 --> 02:32.802
into the party animals we are now

02:32.803 --> 02:35.273
and changed Splinter into a rat.

02:35.274 --> 02:39.716
So maybe we can use it
to change him back.

02:39.717 --> 02:41.419
It's worth a try,

02:41.420 --> 02:44.559
if i can mix up the right chemicals
to reactivate it.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.763
Primo concept, bud.

02:46.764 --> 02:48.567
Let's tell master Splinter.

02:50.305 --> 02:52.541
So that's the plan, sensei.

02:52.542 --> 02:54.011
Are you agreeable to it ?

02:54.012 --> 02:56.383
To be human once more,

02:56.384 --> 02:58.153
to walk the streets,

02:58.154 --> 02:59.656
to feel the sunlight...

02:59.657 --> 03:01.927
How often have I dreamed of this.

03:01.928 --> 03:05.368
Yeah. I know the feeling.

03:05.369 --> 03:07.873
This is a big decision, my pupils.

03:07.874 --> 03:09.977
As a rat, I have abilities

03:09.978 --> 03:11.914
that have aided us in the past...

03:11.915 --> 03:15.021
My night vision and my sense of smell.

03:15.022 --> 03:16.590
Yes, but, as a human,

03:16.591 --> 03:18.494
you could go topside anytime

03:18.495 --> 03:20.064
to see what Shredder's up to.

03:20.065 --> 03:22.235
I say go for it !

03:22.236 --> 03:23.605
I will.

03:23.606 --> 03:24.607
Yeah !

03:29.150 --> 03:31.822
Careful with that stuff, Donatello.

03:31.823 --> 03:33.024
We get any on us,

03:33.025 --> 03:35.094
and it's back to the glass bowl
in the pet shop.

03:35.095 --> 03:39.170
Not to worry.
Here goes, master. Good luck.

03:42.811 --> 03:46.819
I am human once again.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.357
It's the least we could
do for you, master.

03:49.358 --> 03:53.098
Yeah. Why don't you take your 
new body out for a road test ?

03:54.669 --> 03:57.541
Yes. I believe i will.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.912
Enjoy your walk, master Splin...

03:59.913 --> 04:01.816
I mean, master Yoshi.

04:03.854 --> 04:05.557
He'll be back.

04:05.558 --> 04:06.559
Are you sure ?

04:06.560 --> 04:09.231
I--i--i mean he's human now.

04:09.232 --> 04:10.567
Yeah. Raphael's right.

04:10.568 --> 04:15.076
What if he wants to stay
with his own kind ?

04:15.077 --> 04:17.447
Maximum bummer, man.

04:17.447 --> 04:19.084
It's his choice.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.796
Ok, April.
That's a wrap.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.969
Oh, really, Irma.
Public service announcements

04:27.970 --> 04:29.539
for library week ?

04:29.540 --> 04:32.078
Have you ever heard of such a boring
assignment ?!

04:32.079 --> 04:33.681
Well, gee, April.

04:33.682 --> 04:35.451
Maybe those turtle friends of yours

04:35.452 --> 04:37.589
will show up and lend a little 
excitement.

04:37.590 --> 04:39.459
I'm not that bored.

04:41.431 --> 04:43.668
Rocksteady and Bebop !

04:43.669 --> 04:46.474
I can't believe it !
And the turtles won't either.

04:46.475 --> 04:48.411
I'd better warn them.

04:48.412 --> 04:50.616
Hey, fellas, cheer up.

04:50.617 --> 04:52.419
Master Yoshi's gonna come back.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.125
Yeah ? I wouldn't bet my shell on it.

04:56.762 --> 04:58.064
What is it, April ?

04:58.065 --> 05:00.202
I just saw Rocksteady and Bebop

05:00.203 --> 05:01.872
in the public library.

05:01.873 --> 05:03.876
Those strange-oids.

05:03.877 --> 05:05.747
What do you suppose
they're doing there ?

05:05.748 --> 05:08.451
Well, it's a cinch they're
not out to improve their minds.

05:08.452 --> 05:10.790
And where those two
mutated morons are,

05:10.791 --> 05:12.694
You're sure to find Shredder.

05:12.695 --> 05:14.598
Thanks, April. 
We'll take it from here.

05:14.599 --> 05:17.537
Good luck. I've gotta
get back to channel 6.

05:17.538 --> 05:20.743
All right. Let's find
tin-skin and take him out.

05:22.448 --> 05:25.053
So, like, 

05:25.054 --> 05:27.023
what you reading, boss ?

05:27.024 --> 05:28.559
If I told you cretins,

05:28.560 --> 05:31.298
your feeble brains would fail to 
comprehend it,

05:31.299 --> 05:32.568
so why bother ?

05:32.569 --> 05:34.371
Oh, he's right.

05:34.372 --> 05:37.010
None of these books got no pictures.

05:37.011 --> 05:40.216
This is it !
The key to other realms.

05:40.217 --> 05:42.922
What's a key doing in your book ?

05:45.962 --> 05:49.302
No, you fool.
It's an ancient spell

05:49.303 --> 05:53.376
That will open a portal to whatever 
dimension I desire.

05:53.377 --> 05:56.884
No longer must I beg
that idiot Krang's favors.

05:56.885 --> 05:58.955
I now can call forth my warriors

05:58.956 --> 06:02.161
from Dimension X on my own.

06:02.162 --> 06:06.670
It's been so long since I've been 
able to walk among people.

06:06.671 --> 06:09.008
Hey, watch where you're going, mac !

06:09.009 --> 06:12.014
Perhaps i've walked long enough.

06:12.015 --> 06:13.184
Taxi !

06:13.185 --> 06:16.157
You carrying any money
in those pajamas, pal ?

06:16.158 --> 06:19.663
In my excitement, 
I forgot to bring any.

06:19.664 --> 06:22.536
Then take a hike, deadbeat.

06:24.407 --> 06:29.082
Perhaps a stroll in the park
will be more peaceful.

06:29.083 --> 06:32.523
I have what I came for.
Let us go.

06:32.524 --> 06:35.162
April said she saw them
go down this section.

06:35.163 --> 06:38.435
Try to keep it down to
a roar, will ya, Donatello ?

06:38.436 --> 06:40.873
The turtles.
Hide quickly.

06:40.874 --> 06:43.712
Mucho mysterioso, guys ?

06:43.713 --> 06:46.651
Shredder's been here. I know it.

06:46.652 --> 06:51.061
Wrong, you wretched reptile.
I'm still here.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.497
No !

06:54.569 --> 06:56.739
What now, boss ?

06:56.740 --> 06:59.177
Why, finish them, of course.

07:02.952 --> 07:06.092
I was hoping you'd say that.

07:06.093 --> 07:10.400
Yeah. Now comes the fun part.

07:10.401 --> 07:13.206
Yeah.

07:19.520 --> 07:23.594
This is gonna be like
shooting turtles in a barrel.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.378
Way to go, Leonardo.

07:32.379 --> 07:33.882
You really got 'em steamed !

07:33.883 --> 07:36.353
They got loose.

07:36.354 --> 07:38.892
That changes everything.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.196
Let's blow this joint.

07:45.205 --> 07:48.578
For a rhino and a wart hog
they sure are chicken.

07:48.579 --> 07:50.349
Too bad they got away.

07:50.350 --> 07:53.722
We still have no idea of
what Shredder's up to.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.592
<i>au contraire, kemo sabe.</i>

07:55.593 --> 07:58.131
According to this,
somewhere beneath the city,

07:58.132 --> 08:00.168
There's an old abandoned
subway terminal

08:00.169 --> 08:03.575
that was used as a temple
by some cultists back in the 1920s.

08:03.576 --> 08:05.646
So what's Shredder going to do, huh ?

08:05.647 --> 08:07.650
Catch the next train to Dimension X ?

08:07.651 --> 08:09.654
As a matter of fact, yes.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.159
The temple's located at a nexus...

08:12.160 --> 08:14.998
A point where different
dimensions come together.

08:14.999 --> 08:17.771
If Shredder recites the proper spell
at midnight,

08:17.772 --> 08:20.610
he can open a portal
to any dimension he wishes.

08:20.611 --> 08:23.749
We got to stop him before
he finds that temple.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.789
But how ? There's gotta be miles
of old subway tunnels

08:26.790 --> 08:28.059
under this city.

08:28.060 --> 08:32.299
And, besides, Shredder's
got a map, and we don't.

08:32.301 --> 08:35.541
This is more like it.

08:35.542 --> 08:39.916
Bad move, pops, coming into 
the park all by yourself.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.354
Yeah, but don't worry.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.194
You won't live long
enough to regret it.

08:45.195 --> 08:47.198
The odds are overwhelming,

08:47.199 --> 08:49.635
But i shall acquit myself nobly.

08:49.636 --> 08:52.976
Wh-what's happening to him ?

08:52.977 --> 08:56.349
I--I feel strange.

08:59.891 --> 09:02.762
The effects of the spray
are wearing off !

09:02.763 --> 09:05.401
I must get back underground.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.843
The turtles did what ?

09:09.844 --> 09:11.680
Give us a break, boss.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.786
Yeah, anybody can make a mistake.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.759
Yeah.
Especially us.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.062
Incompetents.

09:19.063 --> 09:21.735
If I didn't need both of you in
the next few hours,

09:21.736 --> 09:23.739
I'd sell you to a freak show !

09:23.740 --> 09:25.676
According to the old book,

09:25.677 --> 09:27.379
the temple is here.

09:27.380 --> 09:30.686
Now I must translate the ancient spell

09:30.687 --> 09:33.392
the cultists used to open the portal.

09:33.393 --> 09:34.327
But first...

09:35.664 --> 09:38.769
What is it this time, Shredder ?

09:38.770 --> 09:42.109
I have found the key to other realms.

09:42.110 --> 09:43.947
Oh, really ?

09:43.948 --> 09:46.451
I'll open a portal to Dimension X
tonight.

09:46.452 --> 09:50.694
Oh, I'd advise you to be careful.

09:50.695 --> 09:55.169
Unless the spell is
spoken precisely right,

09:55.170 --> 09:58.643
It could open a gate
to yet another dimension.

09:58.644 --> 10:03.186
And there are dimensions
much worse than this one.

10:05.424 --> 10:10.033
If I can just reach that manhole
without being seen.

10:10.034 --> 10:12.604
I can delay no longer.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.151
Look at that !

10:22.826 --> 10:24.796
Stop him !

10:24.797 --> 10:26.233
Get him !

10:30.007 --> 10:32.378
So, like, where do we start looking ?

10:32.379 --> 10:35.651
I wish master Yoshi were here
so we could ask him.

10:35.652 --> 10:38.157
Yeah, I wonder if he's all right.

10:38.158 --> 10:39.960
It's a jungle up there.

10:39.961 --> 10:41.964
He's a ninja master, Raphael.

10:41.965 --> 10:43.902
He can take care of himself.

10:43.903 --> 10:46.306
Which means if he doesn't come back,

10:46.307 --> 10:48.511
it's because he doesn't want to.

10:48.512 --> 10:50.482
Hey, relax, turtles.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.853
Master Yoshi would not desert us.

10:52.854 --> 10:55.492
Listen, we can't worry about it now.

10:55.493 --> 10:57.096
We've got to stop Shredder.

10:57.097 --> 10:59.600
Exactamundo.
We need a plan.

10:59.601 --> 11:02.974
Anyone know where
We can glom onto one ?

11:04.478 --> 11:06.581
Come on, april.
Tell me.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.019
Have you ever
Met the turtles
In real life ?

11:09.020 --> 11:10.890
Irma,
Give me a break.

11:10.891 --> 11:12.727
I've done a couple
Of stories on them,
That's all.

11:12.728 --> 11:14.230
I don't even--

11:14.231 --> 11:17.203
Uh, can i get
Back to you ?

11:17.204 --> 11:20.877
What is it ? It's
Difficult to talk
At the office.

11:20.878 --> 11:23.482
Sorry, april,
But it's really important.

11:23.483 --> 11:27.757
Didn't you do a documentary
On abandoned subway
Tunnels a few weeks ago ?

11:27.758 --> 11:29.661
Yes, i did.
Why ?

11:29.662 --> 11:32.668
We need a videotape
Of it, <I>toute suite.

11:32.669 --> 11:35.173
Uh, just checking
My makeup.

11:35.174 --> 11:38.345
I could use
A bit more eye shadow.

11:38.346 --> 11:40.116
Ok. Can do.

11:40.117 --> 11:43.457
Great ! Meet us
At the cornelius
Building.

11:43.458 --> 11:44.592
I'm on my way.

11:44.593 --> 11:46.061
According to this,

11:46.062 --> 11:48.633
The spell has to be
Cast at midnight.

11:48.634 --> 11:50.437
We don't have
That much time.

11:50.438 --> 11:52.441
Don't worry.
We'll find it.

11:52.442 --> 11:55.347
Yeah. We're
The good guys,
Remember ?

11:59.289 --> 12:02.996
Here. Now you want
To tell me what
This is all about ?

12:02.997 --> 12:06.069
It's kinda complicated.
Michelangelo, you explain it

12:06.070 --> 12:08.407
While raphael and i
Check out this tape.

12:08.408 --> 12:11.514
Uh, well, it's
Kind of like...

12:11.515 --> 12:12.849
Well, you see...

12:12.850 --> 12:15.488
Well, if we don't
Find a certain
Subway tunnel,

12:15.489 --> 12:17.158
The world's gonna
End at midnight.

12:17.159 --> 12:18.628
No biggie.

12:18.629 --> 12:21.835
We're getting close
To the temple.

12:21.836 --> 12:23.739
Glad to hear it, boss.

12:23.740 --> 12:27.780
These tunnels
Give me the creeps.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.786
Yeah, i don't know
How the turtles

12:30.787 --> 12:33.525
Can live in such
Substandard housing.

12:33.526 --> 12:36.898
The turtles ! I had forgotten
That they live in the sewers.

12:39.038 --> 12:41.541
You got me out
Of the shower.

12:41.542 --> 12:44.213
This had better be good.

12:44.214 --> 12:48.756
I need you to send me
The neuro-scrambler
I invented.

12:48.757 --> 12:50.459
Why should i ?

12:50.460 --> 12:54.868
Because i can set
The wavelength to
Affect only mutants

12:54.869 --> 12:56.439
Like the turtles.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.409
Uh, and like us ?

12:58.410 --> 13:00.747
It will produce
A brain-warping
Frequency

13:00.748 --> 13:04.822
That will cause them
To see each other
As enemies.

13:04.823 --> 13:07.327
While the turtles are
Fighting each other,

13:07.328 --> 13:10.767
I will open the portal
To dimension x.

13:10.768 --> 13:16.713
Well, it's against
My better judgment,
But all right.

13:18.985 --> 13:20.688
Oh, thank you,
Krang.

13:20.689 --> 13:22.224
You will not
Regret this.

13:22.225 --> 13:24.529
I had better not.

13:24.530 --> 13:27.201
Crotchety old fool.
I'll show him.

13:27.202 --> 13:28.704
When the turtles
Get here,

13:28.705 --> 13:33.147
They'll have an
Unpleasant surprise
Waiting for them.

13:36.721 --> 13:39.225
Why must humans hate
Everything

13:39.226 --> 13:41.731
That's different
From themselves ?

13:41.732 --> 13:44.670
I must return
To the sewers.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.976
There it is.

13:47.977 --> 13:50.282
He's headed
For the subway.

13:52.954 --> 13:55.192
Hey, whatever that thing is,
It looks dangerous.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.713
Hey, dudes.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.719
I feel kind of
Weirded out.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.523
Yeah. Me, too.

14:10.524 --> 14:12.059
My brain hurts.

14:16.034 --> 14:18.973
Hey. Watch where
You're going, nerd.

14:18.974 --> 14:21.078
Who you calling
A nerd, wimp ?

14:21.079 --> 14:23.582
Cut it out. We got
No time for this.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.986
Butt out, geek.

14:24.987 --> 14:27.792
You're getting too big
For your shell.

14:27.793 --> 14:28.960
Oh, yeah ?

14:28.961 --> 14:31.398
Maybe you'd like
To tangle with this,
Turtle ?

14:31.399 --> 14:33.135
With pleasure.

14:33.136 --> 14:36.408
Why are you doing
This ? What's
Happening ?

14:36.409 --> 14:38.413
I'll tell you
What's happening.

14:38.414 --> 14:42.354
We're talking major rumble,
Here and now.

14:53.211 --> 14:54.712
He gave us the slip.

14:54.713 --> 14:56.216
Whatever it was.

14:56.217 --> 14:58.153
Yeah, come on.
Let's go.

15:03.732 --> 15:06.804
So. Once again
Yoshi is gone,

15:06.805 --> 15:09.309
And only
Splinter remains.

15:09.310 --> 15:11.313
So be it.

15:12.383 --> 15:14.486
I thought i heard
Something down here.

15:14.487 --> 15:16.790
This time,
He won't
Get away.

15:19.464 --> 15:22.402
Come on.
Take your best shot.

15:30.820 --> 15:32.590
Ha ! Where'd you
Learn that move,

15:32.591 --> 15:34.827
Off a cereal box ?

15:34.828 --> 15:38.201
Have you all gone
Crazy ? Stop it !

15:40.941 --> 15:43.812
What would splinter think
If he saw you doing this ?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.023
April's right.

15:49.024 --> 15:51.629
We mustn't--unh !--
Fight each other.

15:56.573 --> 15:58.208
That weird sound.

15:58.209 --> 16:01.215
That must be
What's causing it.

16:01.216 --> 16:04.221
I was right.
Get it, guys.

16:11.003 --> 16:14.608
Mondo nutsiness.

16:14.609 --> 16:16.112
Thanks, april.

16:16.113 --> 16:19.118
Gee. It's like
Master splinter
Saved us again,

16:19.119 --> 16:21.122
Even though he's no
Longer part of us.

16:21.123 --> 16:24.596
No matter what
Our <I>sensei's decided
To do with his new life

16:24.597 --> 16:26.933
And no matter what
Shredder throws at us,

16:26.934 --> 16:31.043
We won't dishonor
Splinter's memory
By failing.

16:31.044 --> 16:33.313
Ok ? Let's go.

16:34.550 --> 16:38.557
We've been looking
For hours, boss.

16:38.558 --> 16:43.400
Yeah. I don't think
We're gonna find
This temple.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.906
You were saying ?

16:47.677 --> 16:49.613
You two, up there.

16:51.084 --> 16:53.154
I anticipate
No interference.

16:53.155 --> 16:54.423
But just in case,

16:54.424 --> 16:56.961
You know how to use
Those stun lasers.

16:56.962 --> 16:59.700
Uh, we sure do, boss.

16:59.701 --> 17:04.042
It is nearly midnight.
Time to begin the spell.

17:06.281 --> 17:07.281
Good.

17:07.282 --> 17:08.786
I've lost them.

17:09.789 --> 17:13.127
What's that ?
It smells like incense.

17:14.499 --> 17:16.335
Looks like this
Is it, turtles.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.006
All right.
Let's take them.

17:22.047 --> 17:23.648
All right, shredder.

17:23.650 --> 17:26.021
Huh ? The turtles.

17:26.021 --> 17:27.858
Your number's up,
Metal mouth.

17:29.462 --> 17:31.666
On the contrary.

17:31.667 --> 17:32.600
Now.

17:37.378 --> 17:40.717
Congratulations.
You're just in time

17:40.718 --> 17:42.888
To witness
My hour of triumph.

17:42.889 --> 17:45.994
Too bad it's the last
Thing you'll ever see.

17:47.899 --> 17:49.402
Keep your eyes on them.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.408
I must recite the spell
Exactly right

17:52.409 --> 17:54.345
To open
The proper portal.

17:54.346 --> 17:56.416
Gotcha, boss.

17:56.417 --> 17:58.320
"the hour has come.

17:58.321 --> 18:01.226
"by ancient law
And powers dark,

18:01.227 --> 18:04.633
"let space and time
Begin to part.

18:04.634 --> 18:06.737
"portal now
Open wide.

18:06.738 --> 18:10.010
"reveal at last
What is inside.

18:10.011 --> 18:12.515
"key within
To my success

18:12.516 --> 18:15.221
Bridge the gap
To dimension--"

18:15.222 --> 18:17.459
Stop !
What ?

18:19.264 --> 18:22.202
No ! The spell
Has been miscast.

18:23.773 --> 18:25.709
Master splinter,
Look out.

18:34.060 --> 18:36.231
You cretins !

18:36.232 --> 18:38.669
Must i do
Everything myself ?

18:50.628 --> 18:52.063
What's going on ?

18:52.064 --> 18:55.235
He has opened a portal
To the wrong dimension.

18:55.236 --> 18:57.474
We've got to stop that thing.

18:57.475 --> 18:59.143
Good thinking.

18:59.144 --> 19:00.647
Any idea how ?

19:00.648 --> 19:03.853
The portal will
Only remain open
For a few moments.

19:03.854 --> 19:05.323
Once it closes,

19:05.324 --> 19:08.196
That creature
Will remain in our world.

19:08.197 --> 19:12.104
We've got to drive it
Back through the portal.

19:12.105 --> 19:13.506
Turtle power !

19:21.724 --> 19:24.362
We got
Double trouble.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.268
You can
Say that again.

19:30.642 --> 19:32.178
Let go.

19:35.485 --> 19:37.321
Time to retreat, guys.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.198
Hey, boss.

19:44.236 --> 19:45.806
Thanks, boss.

19:45.807 --> 19:47.308
I only did it

19:47.309 --> 19:50.415
So i can think of
A suitable punishment
For you later.

19:50.416 --> 19:52.686
Now run !

19:57.497 --> 19:59.300
It's through
The portal.

19:59.301 --> 20:01.771
You got a mind
Like a steel trap,
You know that ?

20:01.772 --> 20:04.811
There's only
One thing to do.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.282
We have to destroy
The entire place.

20:07.283 --> 20:10.288
Easier said than done,
Fearless leader.

20:10.289 --> 20:13.228
Quick. Lure it
Towards the column.

20:20.143 --> 20:21.645
Time to boogie.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.166
Thanks for
Your help, april.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.670
Oh, don't mention it.

20:33.671 --> 20:36.108
I just love spending
A relaxing evening

20:36.109 --> 20:38.078
Fighting monsters
From another dimension.

20:39.850 --> 20:41.953
Gee, april,
Where've you been ?

20:41.954 --> 20:44.525
Believe me, you
Don't want to know.

20:44.526 --> 20:46.729
I can't wait to hear.

20:46.730 --> 20:49.635
You're onto a big story
Involving those turtles,
Right ?

20:49.636 --> 20:52.374
Golly, irma,
There's no fooling you.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.145
Oh, darn it.

20:54.146 --> 20:56.382
You reporters
Have all the fun.

20:56.383 --> 20:59.756
Oh, sure.
It's a million laughs.

20:59.757 --> 21:02.862
And so i merely
Followed the trail
Of the incense

21:02.863 --> 21:05.435
To the temple.
The rest you know.

21:05.436 --> 21:07.739
Gee, <I>sensei,
We're really sorry

21:07.740 --> 21:10.478
Your changing back into
A human didn't take.

21:10.479 --> 21:13.351
I do not regret it.

21:13.352 --> 21:16.790
After seeing how humans
Treat one another,

21:16.791 --> 21:19.129
I prefer being
An animal.

21:19.130 --> 21:22.636
Besides, if i had not
Turned back into
My present form,

21:22.637 --> 21:25.041
I would not have been
Able to reach you
In time,

21:25.042 --> 21:27.345
And shredder
Would have won.

21:27.346 --> 21:29.784
I never thought
Of it that way.

21:29.785 --> 21:31.788
And the really
Neat part is

21:31.789 --> 21:33.759
Now that you're
A rat again,

21:33.760 --> 21:37.667
It leaves more pizza
For us.
