WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:03.095
- THERE WAS A GUY
WHO WORKED FOR ME FOR TWO YEARS.

00:03.210 --> 00:04.586
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

00:04.690 --> 00:05.850
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

00:05.970 --> 00:06.959
I MISS THAT GUY.

00:07.070 --> 00:08.685
- I'M NOT THAT GUY.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.961
HE'S A VERY WEIRD,
GRUMPY GUY.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.001
WHO KNOWS IF IT WILL
EVEN WORK OUT?

00:12.110 --> 00:13.316
- I HAVE A DOCTOR APPOINTMENT,

00:13.420 --> 00:14.523
SO I'LL JUST
MEET YOU GUYS THERE.

00:14.630 --> 00:17.497
- KRISTINA BRAVERMAN?

00:29.850 --> 00:32.330
- ALL RIGHT, SO THEY SAID
THE VENDING MACHINE

00:32.440 --> 00:35.819
WAS IN THE HALL
NEAR THE WATER FOUNTAIN.

00:35.930 --> 00:37.409
- DORITOS, BABY.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.784
- NOW, SKI'I'I'LES COST 75 CENTS,
AND I'VE GOT $5,

00:39.900 --> 00:41.515
SO I'M DEFINITELY GETTING
TWO PACKETS OF THOSE,

00:41.620 --> 00:42.484
AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE.

00:42.590 --> 00:43.898
THIS IS GREAT.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.527
I CAN GET WHATEVER I WANT,
AND NO ONE CAN SAY NO TO ME.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.485
- WAIT, THIS IS WHERE
THE WATER FOUNTAIN IS.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.070
- WHERE'S THE VENDING MACHINE?
- THEY TOOK IT AWAY LAST JUNE.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.609
- NO.
- AW, MAN.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.531
- NO. NO, IT'S NOT FAIR!

01:01.640 --> 01:02.709
NO.

01:02.820 --> 01:04.606
IT'S NOT FAIR!

01:04.710 --> 01:07.599
HOW COULD THEY DO--

01:07.720 --> 01:10.848
[panﬁng]

01:10.960 --> 01:13.645
NO.
- MAN, CHILL OUT.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.384
- WELL, I AM SO GLAD
I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO CHECK OUT

01:21.490 --> 01:25.381
THE 2007 DECEMBER ISSUE
OF WOMAN'S DAY.

01:25.490 --> 01:28.630
I FEEL LIKE I'VE REDISCOVERED
MY HOLIDAY SPIRIT.

01:28.740 --> 01:33.609
I NOW KNOW FIVE AMAZING WAYS
TO REUSE GIFT WRAP.

01:33.710 --> 01:34.847
WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL--

01:34.950 --> 01:36.815
OUR APPOINTMENT
WAS TWO HOURS AGO.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.262
- YEP.

01:38.370 --> 01:39.746
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
- YEAH, I KNOW.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.431
- I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF A WAY
IS THAT TO RUN A PRACTICE?

01:41.540 --> 01:44.122
- I DON'T KNOW, ADAM.
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.502
- IT'S A CRAPPY WAY
TO RUN A PRACTICE.

01:45.620 --> 01:48.919
- IT'S CRAP, OKAY?
IT'S CRAP.

01:49.030 --> 01:51.169
- IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME, RIGHT?

01:51.280 --> 01:53.931
NEW KID ON THE CANCER BLOCK?

01:54.040 --> 01:56.315
YOUR HAIR'S
A DEAD GIVEAWAY.

01:56.420 --> 01:57.557
- OH.

01:57.660 --> 01:58.934

STOP COMING AFTER A WHILE.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.689

02:00.810 --> 02:02.311

02:05.400 --> 02:06.389
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.252
- SO WHAT STAGE?
[phone chimes]

02:08.360 --> 02:10.089
- I'M SORRY?
- WHAT STAGE?

02:10.190 --> 02:11.509
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:11.610 --> 02:12.918
WE'RE JUST HERE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

02:13.020 --> 02:15.477
- OH, I WAS 2B.
- I'M NOT ZB.

02:15.580 --> 02:16.956
- OH! THAT IS THE QUESTION.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.334
- [laughs] THAT'S FUNNY.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.829
- I HAD TO DO A LUMPECTOMY,
CHEMO, AND RADIATION.

02:20.930 --> 02:23.546
THE TRIPLE CROWN.
HELLO, MEDICAL MARIJUANA, HUH?

02:23.660 --> 02:24.581
- HM.

02:24.690 --> 02:26.897
- GWEN CHAMBERS?
- OH. ONE SEC, CARMEN.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.628
LISTEN, ALL THIS REALLY
MESSES WITH YOUR HEAD.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.379
YOU'RE GONNA GET REALLY
CONFUSED, REALLY FAST.

02:31.490 --> 02:33.697
CALL ME. SERIOUSLY.
- THAT'S NICE. OKAY.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.529
- DON'T WORRY, I WON'T TRY
TO GET YOU TO TAKE SHOTS

02:35.630 --> 02:36.870
OF WHEATGRASS.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.187
THAT CRAP MADE ME
MORE NAUSEOUS THAN THE CHEMO.

02:39.290 --> 02:40.632
- I'LL BET.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.459
- THANK YOU.
HAVE A GOOD VISIT.

02:44.850 --> 02:48.889
- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY HER
HUSBAND STOPPED SHOWING UP.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.373
- [sighs] ADAM.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.198
- I KNOW YOU'VE PROBABLY
NEVER MET A PIRATE BEFORE.

02:55.310 --> 02:56.447
I'VE GOT CANCER JUST LIKE YOU.
- STOP.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.927
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE JUST ROTTEN.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.519
[laughter]

03:00.620 --> 03:02.315
- I KNOW THAT THIS
IS, LIKE, REALLY LAST MINUTE.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.899
- YEAH.
- BUT WE'RE DESPERATE.

03:04.010 --> 03:07.525
OUR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER,
WHO WE BOOKED A YEAR AGO--

03:07.630 --> 03:09.734
HELLO--HAS WEST NILE VIRUS.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.523
- [chuckles] OH, I--
SORRY, IT'S NOT FUNNY AT ALL.

03:11.630 --> 03:13.564
IT'S JUST YOU HEAR ABOUT IT.
- NO. I KNOW.

03:13.670 --> 03:14.898
- IT'S REAL.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.328

03:16.430 --> 03:18.705

SO MANY DIFFERENT STYLES.

03:33.730 --> 03:35.413
HE'S SO TALENTED.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.932
AND, UM, SO WHAT KIND OF THINGS
WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?

03:38.040 --> 03:40.452
- WELL, WE REALLY WANT SOMETHING
THAT'S MORE KIND OF--

03:40.560 --> 03:41.766

SO, LIKE, PICTURES

03:49.500 --> 03:50.842
- HANK, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- YEAH.

03:50.950 --> 03:52.429
- BIG WEDDING, HUH?

03:52.540 --> 03:53.916

FOR, LIKE, EIGHT MONTHS.

03:54.020 --> 03:55.464
- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IT WORKS.
I JUST--YOU KNOW.

03:55.580 --> 03:56.842
- BABE, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.120
- WELL, YOU BETTER BELIEVE
I WANT MY PICTURE TAKEN.

03:58.230 --> 03:59.572
- YEAH.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.477
- YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
BOOKED ON SATURDAY.

04:01.580 --> 04:02.854
- NO, WE'RE--SORRY, HE'S WRONG.
WE'RE FREE. WE'RE FREE.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.404
- NOPE.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.205
- SORRY. WHAT DO WE HAVE?
- IT'S NOT IN THE BOOK.

04:07.310 --> 04:10.370
I'M TAKING A PERSONAL DAY
ON SATURDAY.

04:10.490 --> 04:12.037
- CAN IT--CAN IT
BE ANOTHER DAY

04:12.140 --> 04:13.892
FOR YOUR PERSON?

04:14.010 --> 04:14.931
- IT'S A "ME" DAY.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.382
I CAN'T.
IT'S A--

04:16.490 --> 04:18.663
- IT'S A "ME" DAY?
- IT'S A "ME" DAY!

04:18.770 --> 04:22.069
IT'S FOR ME. THAT'S THE DAY
THAT ME WANTS IT, SO...

04:22.190 --> 04:23.396
HEY, LOOK, I'M SORRY.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.660
I CAN'T TAKE
YOUR WEDDING PHOTOS.

04:24.780 --> 04:25.804
- I'M SO SORRY.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.421
- EVEN IF WE WERE,
LIKE, TO PAY EXTRA?

04:27.540 --> 04:29.019
- BABY, LET'S GO, COME ON.

04:29.130 --> 04:30.506

04:42.240 --> 04:45.300
I NEED HELP HERE.
- [SlghS]

04:45.420 --> 04:46.751
- SO, YEAH, THERE WAS
A VENDING MACHINE

04:46.870 --> 04:48.485
IN THE SCHOOL LAST YEAR,
BUT THEY TOOK IT OUT.

04:48.590 --> 04:51.036
- MAX, GIVE IT UP.
THEY TOOK THE VENDING MACHINE.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.526
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

04:52.630 --> 04:55.258
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
LIFE IS NOT FAIR.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.113
OH, DAMN, CRAP, HELL!

04:58.220 --> 04:59.630
[kids giggling]

04:59.740 --> 05:01.628
- WHY ARE YOU BEING SO LOUD?
- WELL, THAT WAS OUR TURN.

05:01.740 --> 05:04.629
HEY, DON'T TELL YOUR PARENTS
I SAID ANY OF THAT, ALL RIGHT?

05:04.750 --> 05:06.809
[car tires squealing]
HOLD ON HERE, FELLAS.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.332
- WHOO!

05:16.520 --> 05:19.557
OH, CRAP.
DAMN IT.

05:22.350 --> 05:24.386
IS PULLING OVER.

- OH, HE'S A YOUNG GUY.

05:31.950 --> 05:33.702
- WHY IS THAT BAD?

05:33.810 --> 05:35.493
- IT'S BAD BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY PATIENCE, I BET YOU.

05:35.610 --> 05:37.009
- LICENSE
AND REGISTRATION, PLEASE.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.079
- HI. YEAH, SO WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM HERE, OFFICER?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.815

EVERYTHING'S FINE.

05:47.960 --> 05:51.544
THERE YOU GO.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.992
- SIR, ARE YOU AWARE THAT
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE EXPIRED

05:54.110 --> 05:55.065
MORE THAN A YEAR AGO?

05:55.180 --> 05:56.863
- ARE YOU SURE?

05:56.970 --> 05:58.551
[pen clicking]
OH, THAT'S A MISTAKE.

05:58.660 --> 05:59.900
HEY, LISTEN, OFFICER,
I'M WITH MY GRANDKIDS.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.591
I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE THAT.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.692
COULDN'T YOU JUST
GIVE ME A WARNING THIS TIME?

06:04.810 --> 06:06.425
HUH?

06:06.530 --> 06:08.942

JUST FOR ONE SECOND.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.477
GET BACK INSIDE

[Lucy Schwartz's
When We Were Young]

06:34.390 --> 06:37.109
- WHEN WE WERE YOUNG
WE WERE SMALL

06:37.220 --> 06:40.804
BUT WE DIDN'T
KNOW IT

06:40.910 --> 06:44.289
AH AHH AH

06:44.400 --> 06:47.221
WHEN YOU WERE HURT
YOU WOULD SMILE

06:47.330 --> 06:50.777
SO YOU DIDN'T
SHOW IT

06:50.890 --> 06:54.337
AH AHH AH

06:54.440 --> 06:58.228
AND I

06:58.340 --> 07:02.231
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

07:05.800 --> 07:08.655
CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MINE

07:10.800 --> 07:13.803
CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MINE

07:26.270 --> 07:30.195
- WHEN CAN WE GET HER IN?

07:30.310 --> 07:33.518
- WE HAVE...

07:34.520 --> 07:35.748
- GOOD. THAT WORKS.

07:35.860 --> 07:38.033
YOU CAN COVER UP NOW,
MRS. BRAVERMAN.

07:38.140 --> 07:42.213
MRS. BRAVERMAN, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOUR ONCOLOGIST

07:42.320 --> 07:44.072
IS DR. GARDNER?

07:44.180 --> 07:48.071
- YEAH, UM, WE JUST MET HIM,
SO I MEAN, I GUESS HE IS.

07:48.190 --> 07:50.522
HE SAID THAT YOUR PRACTICE
WAS THE PLACE TO GO,

07:50.640 --> 07:51.777
AND IF HIS WIFE HAD CANCER,
HE'D SEND HER TO YOU.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.222
- MM-HMM.

07:53.330 --> 07:54.809
- HEY, LISTEN, DOCTOR,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU COULD

07:54.920 --> 07:56.433
TELL US NOW, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN IN THE DARK.

07:56.540 --> 07:57.746
WE'VE BEEN WAITING OUTSIDE
FOR 2 1/2 HOURS.

07:57.850 --> 07:59.158
WE'D APPRE_CIATE IT.
[phone rings]

07:59.270 --> 08:00.749
WHAT?
- IT'S FINE.

08:00.850 --> 08:02.056
- I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT--
- WE'RE HERE NOW.

08:02.170 --> 08:03.683
- YEAH. MM-HMM.
WELL, LET'S MAKE SURE

08:03.790 --> 08:04.814
WE GET ALL THE RESULTS
BACK FIRST

08:04.930 --> 08:06.067
BEFORE WE JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

08:06.170 --> 08:09.344
I NEED THE RESULTS
ON THE BRACA ASAP.

08:09.450 --> 08:11.202
YEAH.
WELL, CALL THE GENETICIST

08:11.310 --> 08:12.277
AT CITY OF HOPE AND TELL HIM

08:12.380 --> 08:13.756
I NEED IT.

08:13.870 --> 08:15.076
- WHAT IS HE DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:15.180 --> 08:16.966
EXCUSE ME--
- ALL RIGHT, MRS. BRAVERMAN.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.969
YOUR CANCER IS 1.6 CENTIMETERS,
AND IS LOCATED

08:20.080 --> 08:22.310
IN THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT
OF YOUR LEI-T BREAST,

08:22.430 --> 08:23.738
NEAR THE CHEST WALL.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.707
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF CANCER
ELSEWHERE IN THE BREAST.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.187
- OKAY, 1.6 CENTIMETERS.
THAT SEEMS--

08:29.300 --> 08:30.744
- IT'S A SMALL TUMOR.
- GOOD.

08:30.850 --> 08:32.260
- GOOD, SO SHE MAY NOT
NEED CHEMO.

08:32.370 --> 08:33.883
- WELL, WE DON'T KNOW YET.

08:33.990 --> 08:35.150
THE SIZE OF THE TUMOR IS JUST
ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS

08:35.270 --> 08:36.544
WE LOOK AT.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.992
A SMALL TUMOR
CAN BE VERY AGGRESSIVE.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.579
WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
THE CHARACTER OF THE CANCER.

08:39.690 --> 08:40.918
THAT WILL AFFECT OUR TREATMENT.

08:41.030 --> 08:44.750
REGARDLESS, WE NEED
TO DO A LUMPECTOMY.

08:44.860 --> 08:46.999
- A LUMPECTOMY.
THAT MEANS WHAT?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.316
- WE SURGICALLY
REMOVE THE CANCER

08:48.420 --> 08:49.694
WHILE PRESERVING THE BREAST.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.769
- SO THERE'S SURGERY
INVOLVED RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

08:52.870 --> 08:54.280
- YOU'LL HAVE A SCAR.

08:54.390 --> 08:56.278
THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT
TO MODERATE DISFIGUREMENT.

08:56.390 --> 08:59.735
- YEAH. I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE SCAR OR ANY OF THAT.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.182
IF THERE'S ANY--
- OKAY.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.427
- IF MY BREAST LOOKS WEIRD.
I DON'T CARE.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.360
I JUST WANT THE CANCER OUT,
YOU KNOW.

09:04.470 --> 09:05.949
- MRS. BRAVERMAN.
I'M REALLY VERY GOOD.

09:06.060 --> 09:07.709
I'LL GIVE YOU
A GOOD RESULT.

09:07.820 --> 09:10.505
NOW WHEN WE DO THE LUMPECTOMY,
WE WILL ALSO REMOVE

09:10.610 --> 09:13.022
TWO SENTINEL LYMPH NODES
FROM YOUR ARM PIT.

09:13.130 --> 09:14.097
WE'LL ANALYZE THE NODES,
AND THAT WILL TELL US

09:14.200 --> 09:16.088
WHETHER OR NOT
THE CANCER HAS SPREAD

09:16.210 --> 09:18.781
TO YOUR LYMPHATIC SYSTEM.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.515
- AND IF IT HAS SPREAD...

09:20.620 --> 09:21.962
- WELL, DEPENDING ON
THE LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT,

09:22.070 --> 09:24.630
WE NEED TO CONSIDER
DOING ANOTHER PROCEDURE

09:24.730 --> 09:26.174
TO TAKE OUT MORE.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.113
IT WILL ALSO MEAN THAT
YOU'LL NEED CHEMOTHERAPY.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.313
- WAIT, IF IT SPREADS
TO THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM--

09:31.430 --> 09:33.216
I MEAN, IS THERE ANOTHER WAY
OF DOING THIS, OTHER OPTIONS?

09:33.330 --> 09:34.706
OR IS THIS--

09:34.810 --> 09:35.970
- I JUST TOLD YOU
WHAT I THINK YOU NEED TO DO.

09:36.090 --> 09:37.318
- RIGHT.

09:37.430 --> 09:39.079
WELL, WE JUST FOUND OUT
ABOUT THIS, LIKE, LESS THAN

09:39.190 --> 09:40.634
A WEEK AGO.

09:40.750 --> 09:41.978
I MEAN, SO WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

09:42.090 --> 09:43.717
- MRS. BRAVERMAN,
A LUMPECTOMY PERFORMED

09:43.820 --> 09:46.095
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER,
OFFERS THE BEST CHANCE

09:46.200 --> 09:47.269
OF REMISSION.

09:47.370 --> 09:49.190
AND I HAVE AN OPENING
FRIDAY THE 26TH AT--

09:49.310 --> 09:52.825
- 8:00.
- 8:00 AM.

09:52.930 --> 09:55.171
[phone rings]
- OKAY.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.679
DOCTOR, I JUST--
- YEAH?

09:56.800 --> 09:59.200
NO! HE'S YOUR COUSIN.
- [sighs]

09:59.320 --> 10:01.288
- HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW
TO READ A PATHOLOGY REPORT.

10:01.390 --> 10:02.971
HE'S ALSO A VETERINARIAN.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.934
LET ME READ THE REPORT,
ALL RIGHT?

10:05.050 --> 10:06.494
LET HIM TAKE CARE
OF YOUR DOG.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.160
- I'M WORKING
FOR A CRAZY PERSON.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.602
WHAT AM I WASHING THESE?
- YES, PLEASE.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.041
- WITH SOAP?
- NO. JUST RINSE THEM.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.536
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
- [chuckles]

10:13.640 --> 10:14.914
- HE'S PRESENTED
WITH A HUGE PAYDAY.

10:15.020 --> 10:17.124
A WEDDING. WHICH SEEMS
A PERFECTLY NORMAL THING

10:17.230 --> 10:18.401
FOR A PHOTOGRAPHER TO DO.

10:18.510 --> 10:20.364
BUT NO.
HE DOESN'T DO WEDDINGS.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.233
LIKE THAT'S SOMEHOW BENEATH HIM.
HE MADE THE BRIDE CRY.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.376
- HE'S REALLY GETTING
UNDER YOUR SKIN, HUH?

10:25.480 --> 10:28.062
- WELL, HE'S REALLY INSULTING
AND DIFFICULT TO WORK FOR.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.058
- YOU SHOULD
CONVINCE HIM TO DO IT.

10:30.180 --> 10:31.556
- I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW I WOULD DO THAT.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.036
- HERE, LOOK.

10:33.140 --> 10:34.459
[imitating Hank]
I DON'T WANT TO DO A WEDDING.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.073
- WAIT, THAT'S HIM?

10:36.180 --> 10:37.863
- YEAH. I'M BEING HIM.
- OKAY, MUCH LESS CHARMING.

10:37.980 --> 10:39.902
YOU HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE ANGRY,
AND YOU DON'T LIKE WOMEN.

10:40.010 --> 10:41.113
- [imitating Hank]
I DON'T LIKE TO DO WEDDINGS.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.664
- NICE.
- I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.259
- BUT, HANK,
YOU SHOULD DO WEDDINGS.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.602
YOU'D MAKE SO MUCH MONEY.
- I DON'T LIKE MONEY.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.359
I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT.
I DON'T KNOW.

10:49.470 --> 10:50.698
- CLOSE ENOUGH.
- OKAY.

10:50.820 --> 10:53.857
- OKAY, BUT I AM AN ASSISTANT,
AND I COULD USE

10:53.960 --> 10:55.575
SOME VALUABLE EXPERIENCE.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.137
- BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
- THAT'S TRUE.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.400
- [chuckles]

10:59.520 --> 11:00.919
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE RUDE TO THESE PEOPLE

11:01.030 --> 11:02.657
AND TH EY'LL GO
TELL THEIR FRIENDS,

11:02.760 --> 11:04.136
AND THAT'S REALLY BAD
FOR BUSINESS, AND YOU'RE

11:04.240 --> 11:05.446
INCREDIBLY PATRONIZING
WHEN YOU TALK TO EVERYONE,

11:05.560 --> 11:08.859
ESPECIALLY ME.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.837
I THINK I'VE REALIZED
WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST.

11:11.940 --> 11:12.736
YOU'RE INSULTING
AND PATRONIZING TO ME.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.833
I WISH YOU WOULD BE NICER.

11:16.950 --> 11:19.464
- AND HANK'S HEART
GREW TWO SIZES THAT DAY.

11:19.570 --> 11:20.605
- IT DID?
- [laughs] I THINK SO.

11:20.710 --> 11:21.984
- DID I GET YOU?

11:22.090 --> 11:23.250
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
VERY REASONABLE, YEAH.

11:23.370 --> 11:24.849
- OKAY.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.291
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND, HE WAS--
- WAIT, WAS HE SPEEDING?

11:26.400 --> 11:27.810
WAS HE DRIVING REALLY FAST?
- HE WAS AWESOME.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.296
- IT WAS RIDING IN THE BACK
OF A POLICE CAR.

11:29.410 --> 11:30.991
- GREAT. BACK OF A POLICE CAR.
- THAT IS EXCITING.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.852
- IT WAS KIND OF
A COOL ADVENTURE, REALLY.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.268
THAT HE WAS ON.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.779
- PLEASE DON'T ACT
LIKE THIS IS NOTHING.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.379
- I'M JUST TRYING TO--
- THIS IS SILLY.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.754
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

11:38.870 --> 11:40.826
- THERE HE IS.
DAD! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

11:40.940 --> 11:42.931
- SOME OVERZEALOUS COP
IS TRYING TO FILL

11:43.040 --> 11:44.621
HIS WEEKLY QUOTA
OF TICKETS.

11:44.730 --> 11:46.049
THAT'S WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.

11:46.150 --> 11:48.459
- OKAY, ZEEK, LET'S TRY
AND KEEP CALM, OKAY?

11:48.560 --> 11:49.492
- THEY GOT NO OVERSIGHT
AND NO ACCOUNTABILITY

11:49.600 --> 11:51.397
IN THIS PLACE.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.467
- DAD!
- I OUGHT TO SUE!

11:52.570 --> 11:54.083
- HEY, WHOA.
JEEZ!

11:54.190 --> 11:55.418
- LET'S GET OUTTA HERE
BEFORE THEY ARREST HIM AGAIN.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.461
- HOW COULD THEY
ARREST HIM AGAIN?

11:56.570 --> 11:57.878
HE HASN'T BROKEN ANY LAWS.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.218
- I'M SAYING I THINK
HE MADE A BAD CALL.

11:59.330 --> 12:00.774
I REALLY DON'T
APPRECIATE THE FACT

12:00.890 --> 12:01.959
THAT HE WAS YELLING
IN FRONT OF THE KIDS.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.436
- RIGHT.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.097
- BUT HE'S GONNA RETAKE
HIS DRIVER'S TEST, PAY HIS FINE.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.474
END OF STORY.

12:06.580 --> 12:07.649
- YEAH, WELL HOPEFULLY
THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.852
BUT MAYBE NOT.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.587
MAYBE THERE'S
A REASON WHY

12:10.690 --> 12:12.339
HE'S LET HIS LICENSE
EXPIRE BY A YEAR.

12:12.450 --> 12:14.759
- I'M JUST PRAYING HE'S NOT
DELINQUENT ON HIS SMOG TEST.

12:14.870 --> 12:17.316
- I KNOW. GOD.
- SHOULD HE BE DRIVING?

12:17.420 --> 12:18.580
- JULIA, COME ON.
- I THINK HE'S FINE.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.589
- JUST ONE POORLY TIMED U-TURN,
I THINK.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.691
- I THINK HE'S FINE.
- HE'S DRIVING OUR KIDS AROUND.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.357
MAKING ILLEGAL U-TU RNS.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.734
- I'D BE MORE WORRIED ABOUT
AMBER DRIVING YOUR KIDS AROUND.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.114
- AND HE IS
ON HEART MEDICATION.

12:28.230 --> 12:29.458
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S IMPAIRING...

12:29.570 --> 12:30.980
- WITH HIS WHAT NOW?
- WHAT?

12:31.090 --> 12:32.944
- MOTOR CONTROL OR SOMETHING.
- WHAT HEART MEDICATION?

12:33.060 --> 12:34.504
- HE'S NOT ON HEART MEDICATION.
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

12:34.610 --> 12:37.226
HE JUST HAD A REALLY SMALL
HEART EPISODE LAST YEAR.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.092
- HE HAD A HEART ATTACK?
- DAD HAD A HEART ATTACK?

12:39.200 --> 12:41.259
[everyone talking at once]

12:41.380 --> 12:42.301
- OKAY. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

12:42.410 --> 12:44.093
HE DID NOT HAVE
A HEART ATTACK, OKAY?

12:44.210 --> 12:47.099
HE HAD SOME FLUTTERING,
HE'S NOW ON MEDICINE THAT IS--

12:47.210 --> 12:48.791
- HOW DID YOU NOT TELL US THIS
ABOUT THE FLUTTERING?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.720
- I DON'T--BECAUSE
HE ASKED ME NOT TO--

12:50.830 --> 12:52.343
- SO HE IS ON SOMETHING.

12:52.460 --> 12:53.973
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, OKAY?

12:54.080 --> 12:55.968
THIS IS ABOUT DAD
DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.184
I'M ONLY SUGGESTING MAYBE THIS
VERY MILD MEDICATION HE'S ON

12:58.290 --> 13:00.076
COULD BE IMPAIRING HIS DRIVING.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.841
- WELL, MAYBE HE NEEDS TO NOT
BE DRIVING ON THE MEDICATION.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.349
THIS IS ENTIRELY RELEVANT.
[cell phone beeps]

13:04.470 --> 13:06.609
- BUT AGAIN, DON'T YOU THINK
HE WOULD KNOW

13:06.710 --> 13:08.018
IF HE NEEDS
TO BE NOT DRIVING?

13:08.130 --> 13:08.539
- WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHY
HE'S NOT TAKING THE TEST AGAIN.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.813
THAT'S MY POINT.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.399
- BUT HE WOULDN'T
PUT THE KIDS IN THE CAR

13:12.510 --> 13:13.579
IF HE'S ON SOME MEDICATION
THAT'S MAKING HIM DROWSY

13:13.680 --> 13:14.612
OR WHATEVER.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.812
- I WOULD HOPE NOT,

13:15.930 --> 13:17.238
BUT, ADAM, WOULD YOU
LET HIM DRIVE NORA?

13:17.340 --> 13:19.581
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.
I GOTTA GO.

13:19.690 --> 13:22.727
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.309
- WHAT?
- ALL RIGHT.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.695
- SO MAX WAS CALLING IT
A LOW-SPEED CHASE,

13:26.800 --> 13:28.859
WHICH I THINK PROBABLY
OFFENDED YOUR DAD,

13:28.980 --> 13:32.598
BUT IT WAS REALLY HILARIOUS.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.736
- HEY, KRISTINA.
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

13:34.840 --> 13:37.729
- YES.

13:37.850 --> 13:41.468
- I REALLY DIDN'T
LIKE THAT DOCTOR.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.014
- OKAY.

13:43.130 --> 13:44.438
- I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY
THAT HE MADE YOU WAIT.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.292
I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY
HE ANSWERED HIS PHONE

13:46.410 --> 13:48.617
EVERY TIME IT RANG WHEN HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE FOCUSED ON YOU.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.166
I FEEL LIKE HE'S DISTRACTED.

13:51.270 --> 13:53.067
AND I WANT SOMEBODY
WHO'S GOING TO BE SENSITIVE

13:53.170 --> 13:54.307
TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

13:54.410 --> 13:55.968
OBVIOUSLY, HONEY,
IT'S YOUR CALL.

13:56.070 --> 13:57.583
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULD FIND THE RIGHT PERSON.

13:57.690 --> 13:59.066
THE PERSON WHO'S GOING TO NIP
THIS THING IN THE BUD

13:59.180 --> 14:00.761
AND TAKE CARE OF YOU.

14:00.870 --> 14:01.939
- I KNOW, BUT HONEY HE ALSO SAID
THAT WE SHOULDN'T WAIT, SO...

14:02.040 --> 14:03.723
- I KNOW AND I AGREE.

14:03.840 --> 14:04.909
WE SHOULD MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR SURGERY SO THAT WE DON'T

14:05.010 --> 14:06.284
LOSE THE DATE.

14:06.390 --> 14:07.493
BUT WE SHOULD
GET ANOTHER OPINION QUICKLY.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.704
- OKAY. THAT'S FINE.

14:09.810 --> 14:11.038
THAT'S FINE.
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.878
HONEY, JUST TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE.

14:12.990 --> 14:14.799
- I KNOW. I KNOW.
- YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.048
- HEY.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.347
[door opens]

14:36.970 --> 14:38.176
- UNBELIEVABLE.
- HEY.

14:38.290 --> 14:39.621
- HEY.
- I HAVE SOME CALLS FOR YOU.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.901
HERE.
- THANKS.

14:42.010 --> 14:43.420
- OH. UH, I JUST HEARD
THAT THE BAND

14:43.530 --> 14:45.157
THAT WE MISSED
THE MEETING FOR THE OTHER DAY

14:45.260 --> 14:48.320
UH, THEY JUST BOOKED
AT WEST END, SO...

14:48.430 --> 14:50.705
- SO WE JUST LOST THEM.
- UH, YEAH.

14:50.820 --> 14:53.368
- NOBODY COVERED FOR ME,
AND WE JUST LOST THEM. GREAT.

14:53.470 --> 14:55.119
- YEAH. WELL, I--YOU
WEREN'T ANSWERING YOUR PHONE,

14:55.230 --> 14:56.982
AND CROSBY WAS
IN A RECORDING SESSION

14:57.100 --> 14:57.998
SO, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T--

14:58.100 --> 14:59.328
- WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST

14:59.450 --> 15:00.576
PULLED CROSBY OUT
OF THE SESSION, AMBER.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.305
- WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

15:02.410 --> 15:04.162
I MEAN, YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD ME
I'M NEVER TO GO INTO A SESSION.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.895
- OKAY, WELL NOW I'M TELLING YOU
THAT IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO

15:06.000 --> 15:09.003
BOOK OUR STUDIO FOR FOUR WEEKS,
THAT YOU GO AND YOU GET CROSBY

15:09.110 --> 15:10.418
OUT OF THE SESSION, OKAY?

15:10.530 --> 15:12.213
WE LOST $10,000.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.662
- OKAY, I...

15:13.770 --> 15:16.250
- WHY DOES IT SMELL
LIKE BURNT COFFEE IN HERE?

15:16.360 --> 15:18.009
- BECAUSE I BURNED
SOME EARLIER--

15:18.120 --> 15:19.633
- ALL RIGHT, WELL
CAN YOU DEAL WITH THAT?

15:19.740 --> 15:23.085
AND CAN YOU PLEASE FIND A PLACE
TO PUT ALL THESE MAGAZINES

15:23.190 --> 15:24.600
THAT ARE LYING
ALL OVER THE PLACE?

15:24.710 --> 15:27.270
STACK THEM UP SO IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE COYOTES

15:27.370 --> 15:29.713
HAVE BEEN SCAVENGING
THROUGH A DOCTOR'S OFFICE?

15:29.820 --> 15:33.881
CROSBY!

15:34.000 --> 15:35.683
- COULD YOU BELIEVE JOHN?

15:35.790 --> 15:36.779
HE WAS JUST MOUTHING OFF
IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE CLASS

15:36.900 --> 15:37.821
TO OUR TEACHER.

15:37.930 --> 15:40.137
IT WAS JUST CRAZY.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.036
- DID YOU KNOW THERE USED
TO BE A VENDING MACHINE

15:41.140 --> 15:42.277
BY THE WATER FOUNTAIN?

15:42.380 --> 15:44.268
- YEAH. THERE
WAS ONE LAST YEAR.

15:44.390 --> 15:45.869
- OKAY, SO YOU USED
TO BE ABLE TO BUY CANDY

15:45.970 --> 15:46.868
ANYTIME YOU WANTED.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.208
NOT DURING CLASS, OBVIOUSLY,

15:48.320 --> 15:49.969
BUT RECESS, BEFORE SCHOOL,
AFTER SCHOOL.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.014
YOU CAN'T DO THAT NOW.
THOSE DAYS ARE GONE.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.769
- MAX, LET'S GO.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.529
- IT SEEMS UNFAIR
THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS,

15:55.640 --> 15:57.983
PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF KIDS
WHO GOT TO HAVE SKITTLES

15:58.090 --> 15:59.398
ANYTIME THEY WANTED.

15:59.510 --> 16:01.057
WE'RE NEW STUDENTS
COMING INTO THE SCHOOL

16:01.160 --> 16:02.195
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.676
IT'S OBVIOUSLY UNFAIR.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.951
- RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.266
- IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH LUCK.

16:07.380 --> 16:09.712
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO GET THE SCHOOL

16:09.830 --> 16:13.209
TO BRING BACK
THE VENDING MACHINE!

16:13.310 --> 16:14.720
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:14.830 --> 16:18.516
- SO BEFORE WE START,
WOULD YOU LIKE WATER? TEA?

16:18.630 --> 16:20.245
ANYTHING?

16:20.350 --> 16:22.693
- UH, WOW. UM, NO.
- I'LL HAVE A BEER.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.040
JUST KIDDING.
- [laughs]

16:24.150 --> 16:26.801
- NOTHING FOR ME. THANKS.
- I'M JUST NERVOUS. SORRY.

16:26.910 --> 16:28.286
- IT'S OKAY.
NO, THANK YOU.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.039
- SO I FAMILIARIZED MYSELF

16:31.160 --> 16:34.368
WITH YOUR TESTS AND
MEDICAL RECORDS THIS MORNING.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.880
- RIGHT.

16:35.990 --> 16:39.198
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

16:39.300 --> 16:42.781
- I MEAN, IT'S OVERWHELMING,
BUT I FIGURE A LOT OF WOMEN

16:42.890 --> 16:45.029
DEAL WITH IT, SO IT'S FINE.

16:45.140 --> 16:47.199
LIKE, IT'S--
- AND SO MANY WOMEN DO.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.722
BUT I'M HERE TO MAKE IT
LESS OVERWHELMING FOR YOU.

16:49.830 --> 16:51.479
- THANK YOU.

16:51.590 --> 16:54.900
- LET'S DISCUSS
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION.

16:55.010 --> 16:58.935
I BELIEVE A LUMPECTOMY WOULD
BE THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION,

16:59.050 --> 17:00.312
BUT IT'S NOT
THE ONLY WAY TO GO.

17:00.430 --> 17:03.843
THE RESEARCH SHOWS
THAT WITH SURGERY,

17:03.950 --> 17:05.770
FOLLOWED BY RADIATION,

17:05.880 --> 17:09.816
OUR CHANCE OF CURE
IS THE SAME AS THE MASTECTOMY.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.080
- OKAY.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.954
- LOOK, I SEE YOU RECOVERING.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.028
YOU'RE GONNA
COME BACK FROM THIS.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.859
IT'S GONNA
BE A TOUGH YEAR...

17:18.960 --> 17:25.069
BUT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.411
- THANK YOU.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.454
- [sighs] HEY.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.869
I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD TALK TO YOU.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.493
- OH, THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.249
- LISTEN, IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS IF YOU WANT

17:38.360 --> 17:40.533
TO TANK YOUR BUSINESS,
BUT IF YOU COULD POSSIBLY

17:40.640 --> 17:43.882
SPEAK MORE RESPECT FULLY
TO ME, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.298
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.049
- SORRY.
IT'S JUST A SMALL THING.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.673
IT'S JUST--I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE AWARE OF--

17:48.790 --> 17:50.951
I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT
HOW YOU TALK TO ME.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.162
- YEAH. NO, I MEAN--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

17:52.270 --> 17:53.828
"TANKING MY BUSINESS"?

17:53.930 --> 17:56.990
- WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW.
JUST TURNING EVERYTHING DOWN.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.486
[chuckles]

17:58.590 --> 18:00.626
- THIS IS ABOUT
THE WEDDING THING AGAIN, RIGHT?

18:00.730 --> 18:02.209
- FOR EXAMPLE, YEAH.
IT IS ABOUT THE WEDDING.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.719
- I DON'T DO WEDDINGS.
JUST ON PRINCIPLE.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.660
- OKAY. IT'S A PRINCIPLE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:05.770 --> 18:10.116
- LOOK, WEDDINGS ARE HASSLES.
IT'S MOTHERS AND BRIDESMAIDS.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.972
AND EVERYBODY'S DRUNK,
AND IF I HAVE TO SEE

18:12.090 --> 18:15.116
ANOTHER CHICKEN DANCE,
I'M GONNA KILL EVERYBODY, OKAY?

18:15.230 --> 18:17.460
IT'S DOVES CRAPPING ALL OVER
THE PLACE, IT'S JUST--

18:17.570 --> 18:18.741
IT'S HORRIBLE.

18:18.850 --> 18:20.431
- THAT'S THE CRAZIEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

18:20.540 --> 18:21.848
A WEDDING IS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DAY

18:21.960 --> 18:23.473
IN A COUPLE'S LIFE.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.059
I THINK IT'S JUST YOUR ATTITUDE.
- THAT IS MY ATTITUDE!

18:25.170 --> 18:26.125
- RIGHT.
- WEDDINGS SUCK.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.719
SO I DON'T DO THEM.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.058
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU SEEM TO TAKE PRIDE

18:29.170 --> 18:30.899
IN PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.274
AND BUSINESS.

18:32.380 --> 18:33.824
- LOOK, I DON'T
HAVE TO TAKE EVERY JOB.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.202
- YOU DON'T TAKE ANY JOB!
- YOU DON'T TAKE ANY JOB.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.969
- WE'VE GOT A DATE BOOK
FULL OF EMPTY PAGES.

18:37.080 --> 18:41.141
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK YOU ARE A TRUE ARTIST,

18:41.250 --> 18:42.877
BUT YOU'RE AFRAID
THAT IF YOU'RE AN ARTIST

18:42.980 --> 18:44.766
WHO'S ALSO A GUY
WHO SHOOTS WEDDINGS,

18:44.880 --> 18:48.600
THEN SOMEHOW
YOU'RE A FAILURE.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.178
- THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK
THAT I THINK I AM?

18:51.300 --> 18:52.324
A FAILURE?

18:52.440 --> 18:54.886
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
I, UH...

18:54.990 --> 18:57.811
- 'CAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
A FAILURE'S ASSISTANT.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.569
- OKAY.

18:59.690 --> 19:03.069
LOOK, YOU KNOW, MY ONLY POINT
WAS I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE

19:03.170 --> 19:04.341
DONE THE WEDDING.

19:04.450 --> 19:07.066
- I THOUGHT YOUR POINT
WAS HOW I TALKED TO YOU.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.512
- [sighs] THAT TOO.

19:09.630 --> 19:12.383
- OH, I CAN GUESS
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

19:12.490 --> 19:13.627
- OH.

19:13.730 --> 19:15.209
- ONE OF MY GRANDKIDS
RATTED ME OUT, RIGHT?

19:15.320 --> 19:16.218
- WELL--
- NO.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.594
- NO, WHAT?

19:17.700 --> 19:19.349
- I WAS UNLAWFULLY
DETAINED BY THE WAY.

19:19.460 --> 19:21.041
- I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS LEGAL
TO PULL YOU OVER.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.843
- ARRESTED FOR MAKING
AN ILLEGAL U-TURN.

19:22.950 --> 19:24.178
- YEAH.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.187
- THEN YOU GOT
LIPPY WITH THE COP.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.699
- LIPPY?
YEAH, LIPPY.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.742
WELL, I MAY HAVE USED
SOME INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE.

19:28.850 --> 19:29.987
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT,
I MAY HAVE.

19:30.090 --> 19:31.227
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

19:31.340 --> 19:32.602
- YOU KNOW, LANGUAGE
YOUR KIDS ARE GONNA HEAR

19:32.720 --> 19:34.267
WHEN THEY GET OUT
IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW?

19:34.380 --> 19:35.369
THEY'RE GONNA HEAR
THOSE KINDS OF WORDS.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.095
I MEAN, IT'S ADULT LANGUAGE.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.098
- ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

19:39.210 --> 19:40.347
- IT'S NOT?

19:40.450 --> 19:42.031
- WHAT WE CAME TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT WAS

19:42.140 --> 19:44.825
YOUR DRIVING WITH
AN EXPIRED LICENSE.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.248
- YEAH, THE PLATES EXPIRED.

19:46.350 --> 19:49.239
- NO, YOUR LICENSE
WAS EXPIRED BY OVER A YEAR.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.668
- OH, YEAH. I FORGOT.
- YOU FORGOT, OKAY.

19:50.770 --> 19:52.658
- TO RENEW IT.
- FOR A YEAR, DAD?

19:52.770 --> 19:53.737
- I GUESS.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.114
THAT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.847
- YOU FORGOT.
- YEAH, IT SLIPPED MY MIND.

19:56.950 --> 20:00.078
- SO YOU'RE NOT AVOIDING IT.
- WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING, JULIA?

20:00.190 --> 20:01.464
- JUST--JUST A YEAR.

20:01.570 --> 20:03.333
- THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS NOW--
- I WAS JUST ASKING.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.816
- YEAH?
- I'M JUST ASKING, OKAY?

20:04.920 --> 20:06.672
WE'RE ONLY BRINGING THIS UP
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

20:06.790 --> 20:10.260
OUR KIDS WERE IN THE CAR AND
IT ENDED UP BEING A BIT OF A--

20:10.380 --> 20:11.404
- OH, COME ON.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.715
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
HOLD ON.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.548
I MEAN, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I WOULD EVER

20:15.660 --> 20:16.866
PUT THE GRANDKIDS
IN DANGER?

20:16.970 --> 20:18.824
DO YOU THINK--?
- NO, DAD, THAT'S NOT--

20:18.940 --> 20:20.168
- HONESTLY DO YOU THINK THAT--
- THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SAYING.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.656
- WELL, I WOULD ASSUME NOT.

20:21.770 --> 20:25.171
BUT IT IS WHAT BROUGHT US
TO THIS POINT HERE.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.803
- WE'RE JUST ALL
A LITTLE CONCERNED HERE.

20:26.910 --> 20:28.798
- WITH YOUR DRIVING OUR KIDS.
- THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

20:28.910 --> 20:30.218
- HMM.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.809
SO YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING BEHIND MY BACK.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.115
- YOU WERE HANDCUFFED IN FRONT
OF THE GRANDKIDS FOR SOME--

20:34.230 --> 20:37.358
- OH, FOR GOD--

20:39.300 --> 20:43.851
[door opens and slams]

20:43.960 --> 20:45.757
- WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE
PROUD OF YOURSELVES.

20:45.860 --> 20:46.645
- NO, MOM, WE JUST
FELT THE TOPIC

20:46.760 --> 20:48.546
NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED, SO...

20:48.660 --> 20:51.128
- HE'S NOT AN INVALID.
- NO, CLEARLY.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.514
- HE'S NOT READY
TO BE PUT OUT TO PASTURE.

20:53.630 --> 20:57.282
HE'S NOT THERE YET.
HE'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.483
YOU KNOW, HE FORGOT
TO SEND IN HIS RENEWAL.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.047
BIG DEAL.

21:03.150 --> 21:06.608
SHAME ON YOU.

21:06.710 --> 21:10.817
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
I MEAN--

21:10.920 --> 21:13.912
[door opens and closes]

21:21.790 --> 21:22.825
- DAD?

21:22.930 --> 21:27.651
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, SONNY.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.762
- OKAY.

21:29.870 --> 21:31.758
- AND I'M PISSED AT ALL OF YOU.
THAT'S WHY I LEI-T.

21:31.870 --> 21:33.667
I JUST WANT TO CALM DOWN,
YOU KNOW.

21:33.770 --> 21:37.763
I'D JUST LIKE
A FEW MINUTES TO MYSELF.

21:40.120 --> 21:44.329
- OKAY.

21:55.550 --> 21:57.996
I KNOW ABOUT YOUR
HEART CONDITION, DAD.

22:04.590 --> 22:09.118
- ADAM, I'M GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT, OKAY?

22:11.150 --> 22:13.425
[sighs]

22:20.330 --> 22:23.914
THEN AGAIN, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, DO YOU?

22:29.380 --> 22:31.848
- I GUESS NOT.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.398
- HE'S REALLY TALENTED,
AND I GET THE THING OF WANTING

22:47.500 --> 22:49.149
TO BE TRUE TO YOUR ART
OR WHATEVER,

22:49.260 --> 22:51.569
BUT IT'S JUST SUCH A WASTE.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.079
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH
POTENTIAL THERE, YOU KNOW?

22:53.190 --> 22:56.227
AND, LIKE, HE COULD BE AN ARTIST
AND RUN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.

22:56.340 --> 22:57.739
DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M DOING?

22:57.850 --> 23:00.364
I'M EATING ICE CREAM
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE CONTAINER--

23:00.480 --> 23:02.129
- THAT'S HOW I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.332
- I KNOW.
- I CAN TELL.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.951
- BUT THIS IS A CLICHE,
YOU REALIZE.

23:05.070 --> 23:07.163
AND I'M JUST PERPETUATING IT.
HERE, SWITCH WITH ME.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.588
- [laughs]
OKAY, PERFECT.

23:08.690 --> 23:11.250
- I FEEL REALLY GOOD.

23:11.350 --> 23:14.729
IT JUST--IT MATTERS TO ME.
- MM-HMM.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.900
- AND I WANT IT
TO MATTER TO HIM.

23:18.010 --> 23:20.319
- I TOTALLY...

23:20.430 --> 23:23.046
GET THAT.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.221
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?

23:27.330 --> 23:29.537
- YES.

23:29.640 --> 23:32.097
- OKAY.
- [sighs] YEAH.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.360
SORRY.
- NO, NO. NO.

23:33.480 --> 23:37.541
THIS ICE CREAM IS DELICIOUS.
- [laughs] SEE?

23:48.150 --> 23:51.074
- SO THIS SITE SAYS
THAT IF VENDING MACHINES...

23:51.180 --> 23:53.045
- HEY!
HEY, GIRLS.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.253
HEY.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.453
- [baby] DA-DA!

23:56.570 --> 23:58.049
- HONEY, YOU'RE NOT
SEARCHING FOR ANYTHING

23:58.160 --> 23:59.229
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE SEARCHING FOR, ARE YOU?

23:59.330 --> 24:00.774
- NOPE.

24:00.880 --> 24:01.801
- DR. HARYANA SPECIFICALLY SAID
NOT TO DO THAT.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.979
- I'M NOT.
- WE GOTTA STAY POSITIVE.

24:04.090 --> 24:05.466
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

24:05.580 --> 24:06.535
WE CAN'T PUT NEGATIVE THINGS
IN OUR MINDS.

24:06.650 --> 24:07.878
- I'M NOT BEING NEGATIVE.

24:07.990 --> 24:11.096
I'M JUST LOOKING
AND RESEARCHING, OKAY?

24:11.200 --> 24:12.269
IT'S NOTHING.
- HEY.

24:12.380 --> 24:13.950
- HEY, BUDDY.
HOW YOU DOING?

24:14.070 --> 24:17.892
YOU READY FOR A SNACK?
- I WANNA GO HOME.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.275
- OH. OKAY.
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

24:20.380 --> 24:22.860
- I JUST...WANNA GO HOME.

24:22.970 --> 24:25.359
CAN YOU CALL MY MOM?
- SURE.

24:25.460 --> 24:28.008
- HONEY, DID YOU AND MAX
GET INTO A FIGHT?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.348
OR WAS HE BEING RUDE?

24:29.460 --> 24:31.212
BECAUSE IF HE WAS
I CAN GO TALK TO HIM.

24:31.330 --> 24:35.630
- MAX JUST WON'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT THE VENDING MACHINE.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.229
WE'RE NOT PLAYING ANYTHING.
- OKAY.

24:37.330 --> 24:38.957
- WHY DON'T I GO TALK TO HIM.
- I GOT THIS, HONEY.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.641
YOU STAY HERE AND REST, OKAY?
I GOT IT, ALL RIGHT?

24:40.750 --> 24:41.978
- HONEY, I CAN DO THAT.
IT'S FINE.

24:42.100 --> 24:46.161
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

24:46.270 --> 24:49.922
- MRS. BRAVERMAN?
- YEAH, BUD.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.099
- HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT PUTTING SKITTLES

24:52.210 --> 24:53.962
IN MAX'S LUNCHBOX?

24:54.070 --> 24:59.554
BECAUSE HE'S SERIOUSLY
OBSESSED.

24:59.670 --> 25:01.558
- YOU ARE APPROACHING
A RAILROAD CROSSING

25:01.670 --> 25:03.558
WITH NO WARNING DEVICES.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.321
YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEE
400 FEET DOWN THE TRACK.

25:06.430 --> 25:07.658
WHAT IS YOUR SPEED LIMIT?

25:07.780 --> 25:09.566
- 15 MILES AN HOUR.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.567

25:12.370 --> 25:14.190
- MAN, I AM GONNA ACE THIS,
AND I'M GONNA SEND THE SCORE

25:14.300 --> 25:17.713
TO THAT GESTAPO SS STORM TROOPER
THAT ARRESTED ME.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.880

25:25.760 --> 25:27.990
- YEAH, I GOT IT.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.964
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE

25:30.080 --> 25:32.071
- OH, PLEASE.
- HE HAD SOME NERVE.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.727
- HE COULDN'T
TELL LEI-T FROM RIGHT.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.239
THAT WAS THE FIRST INDICATION
THERE WAS A PROBLEM

25:35.360 --> 25:36.736
WITH THE KID.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.000
- REALLY. SOME NERVE

25:44.470 --> 25:45.698
I THINK.

25:45.820 --> 25:47.321
I REMEMBER OUR INSURANCE
WENT THROUGH THE ROOF.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.987
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.

25:49.090 --> 25:49.954
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A FLASHING RED LIGHT COMING UP.

25:50.060 --> 25:52.858
YOU HAVE TO STOP.
NO MATTER WHAT.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.234
THAT'S AN AUTOMATIC FAIL
IF YOU DON'T.

25:54.340 --> 25:55.477
- HUH?

25:55.580 --> 25:59.584
IT'S IN THE VISION.
I GOT IT.

26:00.690 --> 26:03.864
HEY, UH, YOU WANNA
MAYBE PULL OVER

26:03.970 --> 26:05.790

26:05.900 --> 26:06.696
AND PARK?

26:06.800 --> 26:09.860
I MEAN,
DO A LITTLE SMOOCHING?

26:09.980 --> 26:11.459
- [laughs]

26:11.570 --> 26:12.798

26:12.910 --> 26:15.492
BEFORE I GET INTO
THE GRIND OF THE TEST.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.228

26:25.440 --> 26:29.752

FREAKING BURNED COFFEE SMELL

26:29.860 --> 26:31.066
OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

26:31.170 --> 26:32.546
I JUST CANNOT DO IT.

26:32.660 --> 26:34.469
EVERY TIME I THINK
I'VE GOT IT OUT, I JUST--

26:34.590 --> 26:36.478
I CATCH ANOTHER
LITTLE BREEZE OF IT,

26:36.590 --> 26:37.579
AND IT'S JUST
DRIVING ME FREAKING CRAZY.

26:37.690 --> 26:39.726
- HEY, IT'S QUARTER TO TEN.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.969
YOU'RE REALLY FREAKING OUT
ABOUT A BURNT COFFEE SMELL

26:42.080 --> 26:43.968
RIGHT NOW?

26:44.080 --> 26:45.763
- UNCLE ADAM GOT REALLY
STRESSED OUT AT ME

26:45.880 --> 26:47.973
THE OTHER DAY BECAUSE
I BURNED COFFEE,

26:48.080 --> 26:50.594
AND THEN THE MAGAZINES
WEREN'T ORGANIZED, AND--

26:50.710 --> 26:52.359
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST
REALLY WANT TO HAVE IT

26:52.470 --> 26:55.917
TAKEN CARE OF AND SHOW HIM
I CAN GET THE JOB DONE.

26:56.020 --> 26:58.500
- THAT'S JUST ADAM BEING ADAM.
HE DOES THAT.

26:58.610 --> 27:00.191
- MAYBE THE REASON
I'M NOT DOING WELL

27:00.300 --> 27:01.927
IS BECAUSE I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING CREATIVE,

27:02.030 --> 27:03.645
AND THAT'S, LIKE, THE ONLY THING
I'M GOOD AT IS,

27:03.760 --> 27:06.615
LIKE, HELPING OUT
WITH MUSIC STUFF, AND--

27:06.720 --> 27:08.347
- YOU'RE GOOD
AT BURNING COFFEE.

27:08.450 --> 27:10.725
VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO THAT,
YOU KNOW, WITH THESE THINGS.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.934
I MEAN, THEY--THEY PRETTY MUCH
GO ON THEIR OWN, I THINK.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.385
LISTEN, TOMORROW,
WHEN THE TRI-TONES COME UP

27:16.490 --> 27:18.242
FOR THEIR SESSION, WHY DON'T YOU

27:18.360 --> 27:19.520
AND I'LL SHOW YOU THE ROPES.

27:19.630 --> 27:20.597
- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE

27:20.700 --> 27:22.144
- YEAH, START
YOUR APPRENTICESHIP.

27:22.260 --> 27:23.454
WELL, I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

27:23.570 --> 27:24.776
I DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING.

27:24.880 --> 27:25.915
I OWN HALF OF THIS DUMP,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.294

27:27.400 --> 27:28.776

27:38.270 --> 27:40.682
HE'S CRAZY, OKAY, AND HE GOES

27:40.790 --> 27:42.064

27:42.170 --> 27:45.037

28:09.540 --> 28:13.169
SO LISTEN
TO MY HEART INSTEAD

28:13.270 --> 28:15.090
- [exhales]

28:15.210 --> 28:21.934
- WHEN I'M HELD
IN THE ARMS

28:22.040 --> 28:28.627

29:32.110 --> 29:33.202

29:33.320 --> 29:36.414
WHEN HE WANTS

29:36.530 --> 29:40.045
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, I, UH, WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

29:40.150 --> 29:41.560

29:44.290 --> 29:46.087
IF YOU'RE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES,
TAKING TURNS.

29:46.190 --> 29:47.532
IF YOU'RE SPENDING TIME
WITH A FRIEND

29:47.640 --> 29:50.700
HOW YOU TAKE TURNS DOING
WHAT INTERESTS YOUR FRIEND

29:50.820 --> 29:54.506
AND THEN WHAT INTERESTS YOU.

29:54.620 --> 29:57.020

ABOUT THE VENDING MACHINE?

29:57.140 --> 29:59.335
- MAX, I REALLY WANT YOU

29:59.450 --> 30:00.929

30:19.260 --> 30:20.841
IS A DISAPPOINTMENT, OKAY,
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA STOP

30:20.950 --> 30:22.087
TALKING ABOUT IT...
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

30:22.190 --> 30:23.293
- ALL THE TIME,
ESPECIALLY AT SCHOOL--

30:23.400 --> 30:24.321
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.647
- I KNOW IT'S NOT.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.741
OKAY? I KNOW IT'S NOT.

30:28.860 --> 30:33.615
- WELL, THERE'S A CYCLE.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.859
- FOR CHEMO?

30:35.970 --> 30:39.519
- NO. ACTUALLY,
FOR HOW EVERYBODY TREATS YOU.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.723
- FIRST, EVERYBODY YOU KNOW
IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE

30:41.840 --> 30:43.489
AND A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
YOU DON'T KNOW

30:43.600 --> 30:45.864
ARE GONNA PAY WAY TOO MUCH
ATTENTION TO YOU.

30:45.980 --> 30:47.049
AND THE PHONE'S
GONNA RING SO MUCH

30:47.150 --> 30:48.833
TILL YOU WANNA SHOOT YOURSELF.

30:48.950 --> 30:50.736
AND THEN, A LITTLE WHILE
AFTER THAT,

30:50.840 --> 30:52.569
PEOPLE, THEY GO BACK
TO THEIR OWN LIVES,

30:52.670 --> 30:55.844
THEIR OWN PROBLEMS,
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU FIND OUT.

30:55.950 --> 30:59.010
THAT'S WHEN YOU FIND OUT
WHO YOUR REAL FRIENDS ARE.

30:59.130 --> 31:00.461
- YEAH, WELL,
I HAVEN'T REALLY TOLD

31:00.580 --> 31:01.854
ANY OF MY FRIENDS, OR...

31:01.960 --> 31:03.882
MY FAMILY DOESN'T KNOW IT.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.615
IT'S JUST ADAM, SO--

31:05.720 --> 31:07.199
- AND HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA GO
WITH YOUR HUSBAND

31:07.310 --> 31:09.096
WHO IS VERY CUTE, BY THE WAY.
- THANK YOU.

31:09.210 --> 31:11.030

EVERYTHING.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.206
HE'S GONNA REALLY WANNA
TAKE CHARGE,

31:16.320 --> 31:18.345
AND HE'S GONNA TELL YOU
TO STAY OFF THE INTERNET.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.928
HE'LL FREAK OUT
EVERY TIME THERE'S A LEFT TURN,

31:21.050 --> 31:22.426
AND THERE ARE A LOT.

31:22.530 --> 31:24.111
HE'S GONNA HAVE
A FRIGGIN' HEART ATTACK

31:24.220 --> 31:26.211
OVER ALL THE WAITING.
THERE'S SO MUCH WAITING,

31:26.330 --> 31:28.116
AND HE CAN'T HAVE
A HEART ATTACK,

31:28.230 --> 31:30.539
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA NEED HIM.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.016
- YEAH, I AM GONNA NEED HIM.

31:32.130 --> 31:35.577
- HAVE YOU SCHEDULED
YOUR SURGERY YET?

31:35.680 --> 31:37.545
- NO, NOT YET.
I'M JUST--

31:37.650 --> 31:38.639
- WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

31:38.750 --> 31:40.809
- I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE
DR. BEDSLOE.

31:40.930 --> 31:42.090
I THOUGHT HE WAS KIND OF--
- REALLY?

31:42.210 --> 31:44.849
- YEAH, KIND OF RUDE, AND--

31:44.970 --> 31:47.109
- HE SAVED MY LIFE.

31:47.210 --> 31:49.007
- WHAT DIDN'T YOU
LIKE ABOUT HIM?

31:49.110 --> 31:50.452
- WHEN WE WERE THERE
FOR MY APPOINTMENT,

31:50.560 --> 31:53.028
HE TOOK TWO PHONE CALLS
WITHIN, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES

31:53.150 --> 31:54.731
OF US BEING THERE.
IT WAS JUST DISMISSIVE--

31:54.840 --> 31:56.694
- YOU KNOW
WHO HE'S TALKING TO?

31:56.810 --> 31:58.528
HIS PATIENTS.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.187
I MEAN, HE GIVES YOU
HIS CELL PHONE NUMBER,

32:00.290 --> 32:02.178
AND HE ANSWERS IT EVERY TIME.

32:02.290 --> 32:04.087
HONEY, LISTEN,
YOU DON'T NEED A FRIEND.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.464
YOU NEED A DOCTOR.
HE'S NOT THERE

32:05.570 --> 32:07.458
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.
HE'S THERE TO CURE YOU.

32:07.580 --> 32:09.400
I MUST'VE CALLED HIM
A THOUSAND TIMES

32:09.510 --> 32:10.954
THE THREE DAYS
BEFORE MY SURGERY.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.573
HE ANSWERED THE PHONE
EVERY TIME.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.999
HE NEVER ONCE SCREENED MY CALLS.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.853
- YEAH, I JUST FEEL
LIKE I NEED MORE INFORMATION.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.302
LIKE, MAYBE THERE'S
A BETTER DOCTOR, OR--

32:18.410 --> 32:21.038
- I REALLY THINK
YOU HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION

32:21.140 --> 32:23.108
THAT YOU NEED.
YOU REALLY DO.

32:23.210 --> 32:27.419
I THINK YOU NEED
TO GET IT THE HELL OUT, OKAY?

32:27.530 --> 32:29.521
DON'T WASTE TIME.

32:32.050 --> 32:35.019

I ALSO FEEL LIKE
I'M KINDA SCARED, YOU KNOW?

32:37.710 --> 32:39.496

32:39.610 --> 32:42.989
- I FEEL LIKE I CAN TALK TO YOU.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

32:43.090 --> 32:46.787
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE A STRANGER,
BUT I CAN'T REALLY--

32:46.890 --> 32:50.098
I CAN'T REALLY TALK
TO MY HUSBAND.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.168
- YEAH, WHY DO YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM?

32:52.280 --> 32:54.896
- BECAUSE HE IS SO POSITIVE.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.309
HE'S LIKE THIS RELENTLESSLY
POSITIVE PERSON

32:57.420 --> 33:01.038
WHO CAN FIX EVERYTHING
AND MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER,

33:01.150 --> 33:04.119
AND IT'S LIKE--
- THAT'S--THAT IS A GOOD MAN

33:04.220 --> 33:05.903
WHO WANTS TO PROTECT YOU
FROM ANYTHING BAD HAPPENING,

33:06.010 --> 33:08.490
AND HERE'S THE THING.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.706
THE BAD THING
IS ALREADY HAPPENING.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.958

34:00.210 --> 34:01.302

34:01.410 --> 34:03.105

IN HERE.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.416
- ISN'T A FIG NEWTON
LAYING AROUND OR SOMETHIN'?

34:04.520 --> 34:05.964
- I HAVE TIME
TO MAKE YOU A SNACK--

34:06.070 --> 34:07.799
- WHATEVER, WHATEVER,
LET'S GO.

34:07.900 --> 34:10.698
I'M GONNA SUGAR CRASH.
- SERIOUSLY. UNBELIEVABLE.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.767
UNBELIEVABLE.

34:11.870 --> 34:13.906
WAIT, I--HOLD ON.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.659
I DIDN'T EVEN LOCK THE--

- WELL...

34:19.950 --> 34:21.679
- AMBER!

34:21.780 --> 34:23.532

34:23.640 --> 34:25.267

34:25.370 --> 34:26.769
FROM SCHOOL AT 3:45, OKAY--

34:26.890 --> 34:28.096
BUT YOU HAVE
TO BE THERE EARLY,

34:28.200 --> 34:29.360
SO YOU'RE THERE
WHEN HE COMES OUT--

34:29.480 --> 34:30.469

I CAN'T DO IT TODAY.

34:30.580 --> 34:32.309

34:32.410 --> 34:33.957
I'D HELP HIM IN HIS SESSION

34:34.070 --> 34:35.378
AND HE'S GONNA SHOW ME
STUFF ON THE BOARD--

34:35.480 --> 34:36.822

34:36.930 --> 34:40.104
I NEED YOU TO PICK UP MAX.
3:45. GET THERE EARLY.

34:43.080 --> 34:43.728

34:43.840 --> 34:47.662
- WHAT?

34:47.770 --> 34:51.115
- UM, I LOVE WORKING HERE.

34:51.220 --> 34:52.699
I LOVE IT, OKAY?
- OKAY.

34:52.810 --> 34:56.325
- UM, BUT I SORT OF FEEL
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN TREATING ME

34:56.430 --> 34:58.990
LIKE YOUR GIRL FRIDAY,
YOU KNOW?

34:59.090 --> 35:01.058
"DO THE DISHES,
AND CLEAN UP THE KITCHEN,

35:01.160 --> 35:03.435
AND, YOU KNOW,
DON'T SAY ANYTHING."

35:03.540 --> 35:06.782
I MEAN, I'M HAPPY TO HELP YOU
WITH WHATEVER YOU NEED,

35:06.890 --> 35:10.269
BUT I CAN REALLY BE
A VALUABLE ASSET HERE,

35:10.380 --> 35:14.828
AND I WANNA BE
A PART OF THE TEAM.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.510
AND I KINDA FEEL
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

35:16.630 --> 35:21.556
BLOWING ME OFF
A LITTLE BIT LATELY.

35:21.670 --> 35:23.877
- CAN--CAN YOU SIT DOWN
FOR A SECOND?

35:28.290 --> 35:32.294
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT,
ABOUT ALL OF IT.

35:41.550 --> 35:44.781
KRISTI NA--

35:44.900 --> 35:46.822
KRISTINA'S SICK.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.414
AND, UH, I'M...

35:54.530 --> 35:57.658
SORRY THAT I'VE BEEN ACTING

35:57.770 --> 35:59.419
I'M JUST DISTRACT ED,

35:59.530 --> 36:04.320
AND, UH, THAT'S
WHAT'S GOIN' ON.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.251
- I MEAN--

36:07.370 --> 36:09.600
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SICK?

36:09.710 --> 36:11.291
- I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ALL THE DETAILS.

36:11.410 --> 36:13.810
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
I'M TELLING, SO...

36:16.340 --> 36:17.546
SORRY SOME OF THIS STUFF
IS GONNA FALL ON YOU,

36:17.650 --> 36:18.924
BUT I'M GONNA

OF THESE THINGS FOR ME

36:20.310 --> 36:23.757
BECAUSE I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR HELP.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.452
- OKAY.

[honking]

36:38.090 --> 36:39.569
MAX-A- ROONIE!

36:39.680 --> 36:40.942
HEY, DUDE.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.574
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I'M YOUR RIDE TODAY.

36:43.680 --> 36:45.739
- WELL, MOM USUALLY PICKS ME UP
AT SCHOOL.

36:45.850 --> 36:47.909
- I KNOW, BUT--
- SOMETIMES, IT'S MY DAD,

36:48.030 --> 36:50.237
BUT EVEN THAT'S RARE.
IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS MY MOM.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.614
- OKAY. WELL,
I'M YOUR RIDE TODAY,

36:51.720 --> 36:53.540
SO JUMP ON IN.

- WELL, SHE'S BUSY RIGHT NOW,

36:56.380 --> 36:58.826
BUT, UH, YOU'LL SEE HER
IN A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

36:58.940 --> 37:01.135
- I HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT TODAY.

37:01.250 --> 37:02.478
- YOU DID?

37:02.590 --> 37:03.864
- YEAH.

37:03.980 --> 37:06.380
- WELL, I'M ALL EARS.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.218
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT DOES "ALL EARS" MEAN?

37:08.320 --> 37:10.948
- UM, JUST MEANS
I'M LISTENING.

37:11.050 --> 37:13.462
- COOL.

37:13.570 --> 37:15.845
ANYWAYS, YOU USED TO BE ABLE
TO BUY CANDY ANYTIME YOU WANT,

37:15.950 --> 37:17.463
NOT DURING CLASS, OBVIOUSLY,
BUT BEFORE SCHOOL,

37:17.580 --> 37:19.673
AFTER SCHOOL, RECESS.
- YEAH.

37:28.140 --> 37:30.995
- ZEEK.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.179
- HEY.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.726
- OH, WELL, IT WENT.

37:34.830 --> 37:36.388
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:36.490 --> 37:37.934
- WELL, THEY TOOK
TWO POINTS OFF

37:38.040 --> 37:42.659
'CAUSE I DIDN'T ADJUST
MY REARVIEW MIRROR.

37:42.770 --> 37:45.182
I ONLY GOT 98%.

37:45.290 --> 37:47.918
OH! GOTCHA.
- [chuckling] YOU--

37:48.020 --> 37:52.059
- HE SAID I HAD THE BEST
THREE-POINT TURN HE'D EVER SEEN.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.366
- WELL, I COULD'VE
TOLD HIM THAT.

37:53.470 --> 37:55.609
- MM.
- [chuckles]

38:02.070 --> 38:04.345
- HERE, THIS IS NOT HORRIBLE.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.997
- GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

38:06.110 --> 38:07.793
- THOUGHT THEY WOULD, LIKE,
GO CHINTZY ON THIS,

38:07.900 --> 38:09.822
BUT THEY DIDN'T.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.660
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT WAS OUR WEDDING.

38:13.770 --> 38:15.419
GOOD JOB.

38:15.530 --> 38:20.217
- IT WENT OKAY.
- YEAH, SEE?

38:20.330 --> 38:22.707
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

38:22.810 --> 38:24.630
- YEAH.

38:24.750 --> 38:26.706
- LOOK AT THE PEOPLE.
LOOK AT THEM, THE KIDS.

38:26.820 --> 38:28.742
THEY'RE SO HAPPY
WITH THEIR LITTLE WEDDING...

38:28.850 --> 38:30.909
- THEY ARE YOUR KIDS, RIGHT?
- SITUATION.

38:31.030 --> 38:33.089
SO YOUNG.
- THEY ARE YOUNG.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.303
- VERY YOUNG.

38:34.410 --> 38:36.162
- THEIR WHOLE LITTLE LIFE
AHEAD OF 'EM.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.441
- [laughs]

38:37.550 --> 38:39.689
YOU THINK THE WORLD'S
YOUR OYSTER?

38:39.800 --> 38:42.314
YOU'RE WRONG.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.695
- THAT'D BE HORRIBLE,
TO JUST THE END THE NIGHT,

38:44.800 --> 38:45.960
"LISTEN, HERE'S
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN..."

38:46.080 --> 38:47.798
- [chuckles]
- MM.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.832
- [moans] MEANWHILE, I WAS
PROBABLY YOUNGER THAN THAT

38:49.940 --> 38:52.113
WHEN I GOT MARRIED.

38:52.220 --> 38:55.701
- OH, YEAH, ME TOO.

38:55.810 --> 38:58.529
- OH, REALLY?

38:58.640 --> 39:02.189
OH. [clicks tongue]

39:02.300 --> 39:07.715
MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU
DON'T LIKE WEDDINGS?

39:07.820 --> 39:09.447
- IT'S A FACTOR.

39:09.550 --> 39:11.825
- OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH.

39:11.930 --> 39:16.208
WELL, I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA BE MARRIED FOREVER.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.130
- WELL, OF COURSE, THAT'S
HOW YOU ALWAYS THINK, RIGHT?

39:18.250 --> 39:21.595
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.008
AND NOW, YOU'RE GONNA
DO IT AGAIN, RIGHT?

39:23.110 --> 39:24.668
- YEAH, BUT THIS
IS DIFFERENT.

39:24.770 --> 39:27.523
THIS TIME, I AM
GONNA BE MARRIED FOREVER.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.599
IT DOES HAPPEN, YOU KNOW?

39:33.710 --> 39:35.439
- YEAH.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.531
- IT MIGHT HAPPEN FOR THEM.
I HOPE IT DOES.

39:37.650 --> 39:39.026
I HOPE IT HAPPENS
FOR THEM.

39:39.130 --> 39:42.611
- HOW'S THE BRIDE?

39:42.720 --> 39:45.439
- ME TOO.

39:45.550 --> 39:48.519
HERE--HERE'S TO THEM.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.895
COME ON,
WE DID A WEDDING.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.840
[sighs]

39:57.940 --> 40:01.046
- OH, MY GOD, HONEY,
I GOTTA GET A NEW CD

40:01.150 --> 40:02.526
TO PUT NORA TO SLEEP.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.779
THOSE SONGS
ARE DRIVING ME NUTS.

40:06.470 --> 40:09.633
- HEY, ADAM.
- YEAH?

40:09.750 --> 40:13.789
- UM, CAN I TALK
TO YOU A SECOND?

40:13.890 --> 40:16.120
- YEAH, SURE.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.470
WHAT'S UP?

40:18.580 --> 40:20.616
- [exhales]

40:20.720 --> 40:23.371
I WANNA GO TO DR. BEDSLOE.

40:23.490 --> 40:25.344
- HONEY, REALLY?
THE GUY WHO MADE US WAIT

40:25.450 --> 40:26.929
FOR TWO HOURS,
AND THEN GAVE US TWO MINUTES

40:27.040 --> 40:29.861
OF INTERRUPTED CONVERSATION--
- I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH.

40:29.970 --> 40:32.666
I'VE CONSIDERED
ALL OF MY OPTIONS,

40:32.770 --> 40:34.761
AND I WANT DR. BEDSLOE
TO DO MY SURGERY.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.563
- HONEY, OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S YOUR CALL, OKAY?

40:36.670 --> 40:38.114
I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE.

40:38.220 --> 40:39.391
I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD

40:39.500 --> 40:40.489
AT LEAST TALK TO DR. HARYANA--
- ADAM.

40:40.610 --> 40:43.602
- WHAT?
- I TRUST HIM.

40:43.710 --> 40:45.644
- OKAY. WELL, THEN,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:45.750 --> 40:46.978
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.
IT'S LIKE DR. HARYANA SAID.

40:47.090 --> 40:48.910
IF YOU FEEL SOMETHING POSITIVE,
GO WITH IT.

40:49.030 --> 40:53.023
JUST, YOU GOTTA STAY POSITIVE--
- AND I'M SCARED.

40:53.140 --> 40:54.129
- OKAY, THAT'S OKAY
THAT YOU'RE SCARED.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.229
- PLEASE, STOP.
- WHAT?

40:55.340 --> 40:57.683
- ADAM.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.415
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO MAKE

40:59.520 --> 41:02.933
EVERYTHING OKAY FOR ME.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.862
YOU ALWAYS HAVE
OUR WHOLE LIVES.

41:06.980 --> 41:09.210
AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
FOR THAT,

41:09.320 --> 41:14.189
BUT YOU HAVE
TO LET ME BE SCARED.

41:16.850 --> 41:19.227
I WANNA BE ABLE
TO COME TO YOU

41:19.330 --> 41:22.470
AND JUST SAY, "ADAM,
I'M--I'M REALLY SCARED TODAY,"

41:22.580 --> 41:23.979
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO HEAR IT.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.022
I DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL ME
TO THINK POSITIVE

41:26.130 --> 41:32.137
OR TO--THAT EVERYTHING
IS GONNA BE GREAT,

41:32.240 --> 41:33.684
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,
I'M NOT SURE

41:33.800 --> 41:37.725
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.593
AND I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE

41:40.700 --> 41:42.975
TO FEEL SCARED.

41:43.080 --> 41:46.072
THAT'S JUST WHAT I NEED
FROM YOU RIGHT NOW.

41:49.290 --> 41:52.396
- OKAY.
I CAN DO THAT.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.978
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU TOO, SO MUCH.

41:55.090 --> 41:58.571
- [laughs]

41:58.680 --> 41:59.920
- KRISTINA, I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DOWN.

42:00.030 --> 42:02.134
- OH, HONEY--

42:02.240 --> 42:05.095
I'M RUNNING
FOR STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT.

42:05.210 --> 42:07.235
I'M GOING TO WIN.
I'M GOING TO GET ELECTED.

42:07.350 --> 42:08.442
I AM GOING TO GET
THE SCHOOL BOARD

42:08.560 --> 42:10.448
TO BRING BACK
THE VENDING MACHINE.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.482

42:12.590 --> 42:13.318
Uaught
