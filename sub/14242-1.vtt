00:13.120 --> 00:16.159
have gathered outside
the Montrose Hill State Penitentiary,

00:16.280 --> 00:20.479
but the planned protests against the
death sentence have failed to appear,

00:20.600 --> 00:22.879
which isn't surprising
given the nature of the offence.

A former schoolteacher
convicted in 2006

00:26.120 --> 00:29.319
of the rape and murder
of 1 2-year-old Susie Cabina,

00:29.440 --> 00:33.399

for his infamous line of defence.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.359
Upon his arrest, he told the police,
"She should've run faster."

The condemned is permitted
to make a final statement.

You know Steve Reynolds?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.839
Well, it turns out his wife is sick.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.039
She has, like,
leukaemia or something like that.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.799
Whatever it is, it sounded long-term.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.279
It's British. The Torchwood Institute.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.839
Hello? Are you listening?

02:29.960 --> 02:32.519
You see, if Steve's gotta come home,
that leaves a space in Venezuela.

02:32.640 --> 02:36.399
And I spent 1 8 months working out
the Maracaibo routes, so it's mine.

been married six months.

single East-Coast section chief

No, no. No, it's not "Touchwood",
it's "Torchwood". T-O-R-C-H-W...

03:01.560 --> 03:02.879
So what is Torchwood anyway?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.599

It's some pretty freaky stuff.

- Are you getting this?
- And if it's got the title "Institute",

03:10.840 --> 03:13.439
that means that it's been officially
sanctioned by the UK Government,

03:13.560 --> 03:14.479

03:14.600 --> 03:17.359
is a big hassle, because that
administration is like kindergarten.

It's gone. It just got wiped
like a virus. It just vanished.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.719
OK. Well, I guess that's that.
Now, go ask around about Steve's wife.

03:24.840 --> 03:28.119

We need a timeline on this.

But the governor's office
would like to offer its condolences

10:27.920 --> 10:30.559
without an admission of liability
for any physical distress caused

10:30.680 --> 10:31.799

By your own admission, you took

going to be within certain limits.

When are you going to let me go?

10:50.440 --> 10:51.959
Well, I don't think that's possible.

was carried out successfully.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.439

And when considering the persistence
of the law, then the Eighth Amendment

11:37.200 --> 11:41.599
clearly forbids the application
of cruel and unusual punishment,

11:41.720 --> 11:44.599

the Fifth Amendment, and I quote,

for the same offence twice."

They will be suing him
for wrongful imprisonment.

they will sue his ass to high heaven

13:11.040 --> 13:13.279
But what was it? Cos the way
those files disappeared...

13:13.400 --> 13:15.759
The world changed overnight, yeah?

13:15.880 --> 13:19.039
Some old British thing
is not on the top of the list.

13:23.440 --> 13:27.559
Torchwood. If that wasn't a virus,
it's got to be some sort of malware.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.439
It's like nothing I've ever seen.
The word "Torchwood" is vanished.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.519
It's been eradicated. If you search
for Torchwood, you get no results.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.519
Nothing gets no results.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.679
Then there's gotta
be something on paper.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.319
The shelves are bare.
It's all gone to Friedkin.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.279
I asked Yvonne.

13:41.400 --> 13:46.039
(CLEARS THROAT) She said it was
classified under the 456 regulations?

13:46.160 --> 13:47.759
She said you want to stay away.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.479
- Why?
- They all died.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.079
So the story goes.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.799
Anyone that worked for Torchwood
was killed in action.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.719
And they died young.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.399
Seen the TV?

14:00.520 --> 14:02.399
It's not just you.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.559
WOMEN'S VOICE ON TV: This goes
beyond America. It's worldwide.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.239
You've got the same reports
from Europe, from Asia, from Africa...

14:10.360 --> 14:11.839
MAN'S VOICE ON TV:
Every death is different.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.239
You can't suspend death
like it's a fixed concept.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.559
This goes against the fundamental
rules of life on Earth.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.639
They shot him!
They shot my brother like...

14:19.760 --> 14:21.999
bam, bam, bam,
but you know, he's still alive ,

14:22.120 --> 14:24.799
and his heart's still going.
He reached out...

14:24.920 --> 14:29.479
Whether it's a disease or an experiment
or a project gone wrong,

14:29.600 --> 14:31.239
it's obvious we're the victims now.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.559
We're the lab rats.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.839
These people are dead,
that's what they are -

14:34.960 --> 14:38.639
dead people sitting up in bed. They
terrify me. I'm not touching them.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.719
I'm sorry,
but they should be corpses.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.399
That's what they are -
living corpses.

14:48.920 --> 14:49.959
Aargh!

15:02.320 --> 15:05.199
The metal missed the spine,
but the pericardium was lacerated,

15:05.320 --> 15:07.559
and a coronary artery
was crushed and thrombosed.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.399
That's the one in your leg.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.999
I had to transplant a section
of vein from your thigh.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.359
But how did I survive?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.519
I...don't know.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.399
But even when your heart stopped
beating, the process continued.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.839
The process of life,
the viability of the flesh,

15:20.960 --> 15:24.279
the transfer of oxygen.
It just...didn't stop.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.599
But do I get better?

15:25.720 --> 15:26.759
Do I heal?

15:26.880 --> 15:28.639
Or do I just hurt
for the rest of my life?

15:28.760 --> 15:30.359
Because if this thing keeps going,

15:30.480 --> 15:32.559
- the rest of my life is forever, right?
- Rex...

15:32.680 --> 15:35.039
now listen to me.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.279
Cos you might want to take
something under consideration -

15:37.400 --> 15:39.919
that maybe you were lucky.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.919
You should've died last night,

15:43.040 --> 15:46.799
but when this thing happened,
the miracle, it gave me time...

15:46.920 --> 15:49.239
to fix you.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.999
Without the miracle, you'd be dead.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.919
It's like someone cast a spell
over the whole world.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.919
But what happens when it stops, huh?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.559
What happens to me then?

16:04.640 --> 16:05.839
Do I die?

16:14.520 --> 16:17.959
- Oh, you are so cheating!
- Cheating?!

16:18.080 --> 16:20.279
How... How can I cheat painting a wall?!

16:20.400 --> 16:22.199
Only a man
could turn this into a competition.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.199
- You just went, whoosh!
- No, look, whoosh!

16:24.320 --> 16:26.159
With one stroke, that's hardly a coat!

16:26.280 --> 16:27.359
(PHONE RINGS)

16:27.480 --> 16:30.359
Oh, bollocks. Oh, bollocks, bollocks.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.239
- It might be nothing.
- Stupid. There's only one reason

16:32.360 --> 16:34.319
why that phone could ring.
Look, where have you put it?

16:34.440 --> 16:35.879
- Where have you put it?
- It's in here, it's in here.

16:36.000 --> 16:36.999
Ssh.

16:38.040 --> 16:38.959
What is it? What's happened?

16:39.080 --> 16:43.359
This is Sergeant Davidson confirming
reports of one suspect, male,

16:43.480 --> 16:46.039
in the vicinity of
St Helen's Hospital, Cardiff City.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.999
Suggest rendezvous at 0200 hours
in the agreed position.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.999
It's my dad. He's in hospital.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.479
Um, I've gotta see him.
I'm sorry, Rhys.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.439
We've gotta go back.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.639
Friedkin's office took all
the Torchwood files, cleared us out.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.839
I know. He sent me to double-check.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.759
Cos files get left behind,

17:25.880 --> 17:28.919
especially if there's a hard copy
inside an associated pile.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.279
That sort of thing
always gets missed.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.879
Just...need to check
on all the associations.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.079
OK.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.879
- Not sure where to begin.
- Better find out, then.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.319
Right.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.519
OK.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.239
Thanks.

18:34.920 --> 18:35.959
456...

18:36.080 --> 18:37.239
456.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.119
45...

18:41.640 --> 18:42.879
456!

19:34.760 --> 19:36.879
(RUSTLING)

19:46.840 --> 19:48.319
Come with me.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.399
(GURGLES AND CHOKES)

20:18.440 --> 20:19.359
Down!

20:27.200 --> 20:28.279
Oh, my God.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.239
- Is...he going to die?
- Don't worry about it.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.839
- No-one dies these days.
- You want to bet?!

20:49.480 --> 20:50.959
Whoa.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.119
Anyway, Captain Jack Harkness.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.839
Nice to meet you.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.479
(SIRENS BLARE)

21:13.240 --> 21:15.199
Here you go.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.359
- That man...
- He was after me, not you.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.559
Why? Why would he want you dead?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.679
On the very day that no-one's dying?

21:22.800 --> 21:23.799
Wish I knew.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.799
And what got you so involved?

21:26.920 --> 21:29.599
I'm not even authorised for this...

21:30.880 --> 21:32.359
...but this friend of mine...

21:32.480 --> 21:36.359
I was telling him
about Torchwood and...

21:38.000 --> 21:41.199
...he crashed his car
while I was talking to him,

21:41.320 --> 21:43.439
and I can't help but thinking that...

21:45.120 --> 21:47.639
- ...it's all my fault.
- I know the feeling.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.199
So what is Torchwood?

21:52.320 --> 21:54.719
Torchwood no longer exists.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.319
Then what was it?

21:56.440 --> 21:58.239
Cos there were photos in that file

21:58.360 --> 22:00.439
of a man
who looked just like you, but...

22:00.560 --> 22:05.199
it said 1 939, then 1 925.
Is he your father?

22:05.320 --> 22:07.319
Suppose it must be.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.519
Are you all right?

22:14.640 --> 22:15.999
Yeah.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.959
I hurt my arm.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.919
Considering what we just went
through, I'd say that was a miracle.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.159
Yeah, another one.

22:29.880 --> 22:33.679
The Torchwood Institute was set up
by the British Royal Family in 1 879

22:33.800 --> 22:37.599
to defend the realm of Great Britain
by investigating the unusual,

22:37.720 --> 22:40.479
the strange and the alien.

22:40.600 --> 22:44.399
I'm kind of guessing "alien"
doesn't mean foreign.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.239
Alien as in extraterrestrial.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.239
- Oh, my God.
- This whole situation, worldwide,

22:51.360 --> 22:53.879
that's exactly the kind of thing
we used to investigate.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.519
Torchwood -
they said that people died,

22:58.640 --> 23:00.599
but there was that other photo, um...

23:00.720 --> 23:03.439
Gwen Cooper.
There was no date of death.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.719
She's still alive.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.199
The last one left.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.319
And I'm going to keep her safe.

23:11.360 --> 23:14.879
Which means making sure that
the Institute stays dead and buried.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.799
So that first e-mail last night,
the one that just said "Torchwood"...

23:17.920 --> 23:20.639
Wasn't me. God knows who it was.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.559
But that was enough to call me back,

23:23.680 --> 23:25.799
and I got to work
releasing the malware,

23:25.920 --> 23:29.919
destroying hard copies, removing
all traces of the word, using Retcon.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.199
What's Retcon?

23:35.320 --> 23:36.799
It's a smart drug.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.839
Selective amnesia.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.159
No.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.279
You won't remember a thing.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.199
Nice to meet you, Esther.

23:55.320 --> 23:58.199
TV: The fire at the CIA Archive
is now under control...

23:58.320 --> 24:00.119
An explosion right at our doorstep.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.839
It's a gift.
Now, take a look at the victims.

24:02.960 --> 24:03.999
Are they dead or not?

24:04.120 --> 24:05.599
You're not the first to think of it,
Mr Matheson.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.399
Now, you can stop running
the case from a hospital bed.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.999
Wait, what are you talking about?
Who else is there?

24:09.120 --> 24:11.479
I really can't talk.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.119
Who else is on to this?

24:13.240 --> 24:14.879
Check the Ringmain.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.719
The what? Hello?

24:17.760 --> 24:18.759
FBI.

24:22.680 --> 24:27.599
Hey, my man,
what the hell is the Ringmain?

24:27.720 --> 24:31.039
It's the internal cameras.
Security system, that's all.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.999
(DIALS)

24:35.120 --> 24:37.079
- (RINGING TONE)
- Uh!

24:37.200 --> 24:40.839
Yeah. Yeah, this is
Rex Matheson with the CIA.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.159
Put me on with your chief
of security. Yeah, right now.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.799
Session begins.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.719
Supervised by attending surgeon
Professor Victor Louis Santini

24:50.840 --> 24:52.319
and witnesses to be listed
in the hospital register.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.319
The purpose of this enquiry
is to determine...

24:55.440 --> 24:59.599
Well, as you'll see, following
the explosion at the CIA Archive...

24:59.720 --> 25:01.559
Got it.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.799
One of the victims has been...

25:09.920 --> 25:12.159
(FAINT WHEEZING)

25:13.600 --> 25:15.799
Yes, I think we can...

25:15.920 --> 25:17.759
I'm sorry.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.799
They brought me in as an expert,
but I don't know what the hell this is.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.079
We think this man was right
at the centre of the blast...

25:27.200 --> 25:28.959
and yet he's still alive.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.879
Clearly, the skin is burnt.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.279
He's not indestructible,
just undying.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.559
(BURNED MAN WHEEZES)

25:44.680 --> 25:47.479
Ever-living. We're going
to need a new vocabulary.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.799
But we're getting the same results
from all over the world.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.799
Is that actual consciousness?
It seems like he's still aware.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.639
Excuse me. I was wondering...

25:58.760 --> 26:01.119
Owen Harper, FBI.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.359
But what if you detach the head?

26:07.200 --> 26:09.599
I mean...would he stay alive...

26:10.800 --> 26:12.679
...without...his head?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.159
- I suggest we find out.
- Excuse me, you can't do that.

26:15.280 --> 26:20.119
I mean, you literally can't.
This man is not dead. He's our patient.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.999
Your comments have been noted,
DrJuarez.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.079
Now, shall we begin?

26:40.080 --> 26:41.639
(TEARING AND CRUNCHING)

27:01.360 --> 27:03.319
Oh, my God.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.679
Don't tell me this is
a virus or evolution or whatever.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.799
This is deliberate intervention.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.639
I mean, all of us
have been changed by design.

27:11.760 --> 27:15.039
- But how? Who could do this?
- Well, who's got the technology?

27:15.160 --> 27:18.359
Simple answer - no-one on this Earth.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.959
What the hell?

28:04.000 --> 28:05.839
Long time no see.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.079
Oh, my God.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.919
Hey.

28:10.720 --> 28:14.399
And you, big lunk...
Daddy Day Care. Look at her.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.559
So your father had a mild heart attack
on Saturday night

28:17.680 --> 28:21.879
and then a second on the Sunday,
and that was quite bad, to be honest.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.439
But he's stable now. He's out of ICU.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.359
Funny thing is, if you're gonna get sick,
he didn't half choose the right day.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.679
- What do you mean?
- Look at them.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.719
They're all gathering around the hospitals
like they're the new churches.

28:32.840 --> 28:36.119
I'm not kidding - we've had doctors
being worshipped since Miracle Day.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.439
What's Miracle Day?

28:37.560 --> 28:39.199
Are you kidding me?
Haven't you heard?

28:39.320 --> 28:40.639
- Heard what?
- Come on.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.439
It started two nights ago.

28:42.560 --> 28:46.439
People stopped dying. They still get hurt,
sick - they just won't die.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.959
Oh, you silly girl.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.359
- I said stay away.
- How could I do that, Mum?

28:57.480 --> 29:00.839
What if someone sees you?
It's not safe, you told me.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.799
What if someone's watching?

29:02.920 --> 29:06.519
Oh, look at her. Oh, come here.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.759
Oh. Good God, she's enormous.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.799
RHYS: That's your grandma, remember?

29:11.920 --> 29:16.199
How could she? Never sees me, does she?
Not since the day she was born.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.799
Oh, hey, come see your granddad.

29:20.880 --> 29:21.919
Hi, Dad.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.679
Hey.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.639
It's me.

29:28.760 --> 29:29.959
Hello.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.239
You shouldn't have.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.119
Well, there we are, then - tough.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.039
And you can stop
all this nonsense, OK?

29:37.160 --> 29:39.759
I want you up and out of this bed,
lazy old thing.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.439
Ah, there she is.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.759
Princess.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.319
- Look at her, though, she's huge.
- She's perfectly normal, Mum.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.799
Thought you were being frugal.
What are you feeding her? Lard?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.839
Yes, Mum, I'm feeding her lard.
Keep telling her that,

29:54.960 --> 29:57.279
and by the time she's 1 3, she'll have
a complete psychological complex.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.119
- Stop it now, you two.
- Sorry.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.679
(WHISPERS) It's OK.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.439
What do you think it is, Gwen?

30:08.560 --> 30:09.999
What happened to us?

30:10.120 --> 30:12.559
This never-ending life.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.959
What is it?

30:15.080 --> 30:17.159
Should I be dead, sweetheart?

30:17.280 --> 30:18.799
I don't know, Dad.

30:18.920 --> 30:22.159
It's the sort of thing...
your lot used to tackle.

30:22.280 --> 30:27.399
Yeah, but, um, Torchwood's gone, Dad.
There's no-one else left on Earth.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.679
Just me.

30:29.800 --> 30:34.199
OK? And I'm sorry,
because I don't know what to do.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.399
I don't know what to do, Dad.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.039
It's all over the world. Look...
Look at this.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.199
Somalia has stopped fighting.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.599
Warfare is even worse
when the bodies refuse to die.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.599
But take a look at North Korea.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.039
Huh, spoiling for a fight.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.959
They've got a lot of soldiers
who think they're immortal.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.239
But this miracle,
it's specifically human.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.159
Well, it's got to be. This website says
if insects stopped dying,

31:38.280 --> 31:40.159
we'd be overrun within 48 hours flat.

31:40.280 --> 31:44.399
And that hasn't happened. So this...
thing is being targeted at us.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.959
Have a look-see. Budge over.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.599
- I've missed all this.
- I haven't.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.599
- It's quiet without you.
- Oh, tch-tch.

31:53.720 --> 31:54.959
Here we go. Look.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.719
Planet Earth. On average,
300,000 people die every day.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.319
So if they stop dying,
that's an extra...

32:02.440 --> 32:04.719
what, million people
in just over three days?

32:04.840 --> 32:07.959
Add to that 500,000 people
born every day...

32:08.080 --> 32:10.479
And that's another million
every two days plus the first million.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.519
Bloody hell.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.119
The fastest population boom in history.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.519
- We're going to run out of room.
- We'll run out of food first.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.079
A guy on the telly was saying
we've got four months like this,

32:18.200 --> 32:21.719
just four months, and then that's it -
society just collapses,

32:21.840 --> 32:24.239
everyone fighting each other
for food, like animals.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.279
Oi. What are you two doing?

32:27.400 --> 32:31.119
- I was just asking for some advice.
- Yeah, don't you start. Gwen?

32:31.240 --> 32:33.559
- Yes?
- No more investigations. You promised.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.159
We're here to see your dad.
That's it. Yeah?

32:35.280 --> 32:39.399
Do you want to come and have a look?
Come on, bright eyes, follow me.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.559
Look, intensive care overflow.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.199
They've got 1 2 beds
with 1 7 patients already.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.359
What's going to happen tomorrow?
And the day after that?

32:49.480 --> 32:50.799
- And the day after that...
- Listen now...

32:50.920 --> 32:53.959
Every time you investigate something,
you end up in danger, Gwen.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.359
- Cos I can help.
- Don't you dare.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.679
- So you just...
- I said don't you dare! Got that?!

32:57.800 --> 33:00.079
Don't you bloody dare, Gwen!

33:02.880 --> 33:06.519
See, the thing is, right,
if you think Miracle Day

33:06.640 --> 33:09.679
is like a Torchwood case, others are
going to think the same, aren't they?

33:09.800 --> 33:11.999
They're going to come
looking for you with guns

33:12.120 --> 33:14.159
- like they did in the old days.
- I suppose, yeah.

33:14.280 --> 33:17.159
We shouldn't even be in the city!
There are cameras everywhere, man!

33:18.400 --> 33:22.279
And it's different now -
you've got a daughter.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.559
And you can't go
putting her into danger!

33:25.680 --> 33:29.359
That is why we live in the back
of beyond - to keep her safe.

33:29.480 --> 33:30.879
We've got to go back!

33:32.280 --> 33:34.279
- My dad is sick.
- Oh, think about it!

33:34.400 --> 33:36.879
People aren't dying.
He's going to survive.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.519
Ssh! No. Ssh.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.119
Think about Anwen.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.919
Maybe our daughter's
going to live forever.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.479
Don't, OK? Don't make her part of this...
this thing, OK?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.759
Don't! Do you think she could?

33:56.880 --> 33:58.439
Possible, yeah.

33:58.560 --> 34:02.879
See, maybe you should
let this happen...

34:04.840 --> 34:06.359
...for once.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.279
Let's go home.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.959
- Yes.
- Let's go home.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.279
What the hell?

35:19.240 --> 35:21.079
TV: The search for suspects continues

35:21.200 --> 35:23.439
after last night's explosion
at the CIA Archive...

35:23.560 --> 35:25.239
Nice for some,
having the morning off?

35:25.360 --> 35:29.999
- Yeah, I, um...had things to do.
- Missed all this.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.519
You owe me.
Yasmin works in Friedkin's office.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.879
She got me the last remaining copy
of the Torchwood file.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.599
Now you can take me to dinner.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.799
(PHONE RINGS)

36:04.920 --> 36:06.479
Esther Drummond. Hello?

36:06.600 --> 36:08.279
Is there a database
correlating mortality rates

36:08.400 --> 36:09.839
with every single hospital in the world?

36:09.960 --> 36:12.719
Are you on your cell phone?
Cos you're not allowed to be using it.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.079
And is anyone talking to morticians?

36:14.200 --> 36:16.599
Because, I mean, they've got to be
the first to notice, right?

36:16.720 --> 36:17.799
There's nothing. There's no news.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.119
The whole thing,
it's kind of intangible.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.719
How do you investigate
something not happening?

36:22.840 --> 36:25.639
And all that Torchwood stuff,
that's gone up to Friedkin.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.319
Oh, yeah?

36:28.440 --> 36:31.679
- So what's Torchwood got to do with it?
- I don't know, it's...

36:31.800 --> 36:33.599
It's sort of connected, isn't it?

36:33.720 --> 36:36.079
No. No, it's not.
It's a completely different case.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.439
Oh, sure. Of course it is.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.959
Then why did you mention it?

36:40.080 --> 36:42.719
Don't know. I suppose
it just happened at the same time?

36:44.640 --> 36:45.879
So what is Torchwood, anyway?

36:46.000 --> 36:50.959
Um...some kind
of British intervention agency.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.319
Closed down, used to specialise
in 456 cases and above.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.039
So that first e-mail with Torchwood,

36:56.160 --> 36:58.319
you know, the security breach,
when did that come through?

36:58.440 --> 37:00.639
Sunday night, 22.36.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.079
- 22.36, huh?
- Yep.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.399
22.36.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.759
22.36 was the last reported death,

37:12.880 --> 37:14.839
the last death on Planet Earth.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.359
Well, that's disputable. They said
that the last death was on Monday.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.479
No, no, no.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.079
Monday in Shanghai. Ugh!

37:21.200 --> 37:22.439
At 1 1 .36.

37:22.560 --> 37:25.719
It's Washington, DC.
It's 1 3 hours behind at 22.36.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.199
Both those things happened
at the same time.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.719
- Don't you see? You were right.
- (MACHINES BEEP)

37:29.840 --> 37:31.159
Ugh! It's all connected.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.599
Torchwood's the key to this whole thing.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.959
Rex, I've warned you,
you're going to kill yourself!

37:35.080 --> 37:36.839
I can't, that's the point.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.719
Uh! All right,
so give me those names again.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.519
Um, um...

37:42.640 --> 37:46.519
Captain Jack Harkness
and Gwen Cooper.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.799
Zero information on him

37:48.920 --> 37:50.279
and no sightings of Cooper
for the last 1 2 months.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.599
It's like she's gone underground.

37:51.720 --> 37:52.999
Yeah, that's them.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.999
The case details have been censored
by UNIT Headquarters.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.959
This file's got referrals
going all the way to Geneva and above.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.959
- It's way beyond top secret.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.559
- CIA, move out of my way.
- You can't take them!

38:00.680 --> 38:03.239
Rex, what do you think you're doing?
Sorry, doc, I'm too busy.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.439
- You are in no condition to leave.
- Oh, I'm not just leaving.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.919
- Agh! I'm flying... Uh!

38:10.040 --> 38:12.039
...all the way to the United Kingdom.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.119
Esther, book me a flight.

38:14.240 --> 38:18.199
Hey, CIA! I'm taking that cab.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.239
Move the hell out of the way. Move!

38:20.360 --> 38:24.279
Now make sure you get a hold of supplies,
cos I'm going to need a requisition 1 5.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.159
What do you need that for?

38:27.280 --> 38:29.199
You do know
what a requisition 1 5 is, right?

38:29.320 --> 38:31.559
Of course, I do. It's clearance
to take a handgun on a plane.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.559
Well, then I'm taking
a handgun on a plane.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.599
Now book that flight.

38:35.720 --> 38:40.639
OK, your flight departs at 0200 hours,
but your requisition has been refused.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.399
- Listen to me...
- Tengo tu pasaporte.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.999
If requisitions won't move,
then get me a handgun from UK Security.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.279
How am I supposed to do that?

38:47.400 --> 38:50.239
- (SHE SPEAKS SPANISH)
- Ssh!

38:50.360 --> 38:52.119
Get me the gun!

38:52.240 --> 38:56.279
Rosita, Rosita, Rosita, here. I don't
know when I'm coming back, all right?

38:56.400 --> 38:58.759
I don't want you letting your husband
into my house. You got that?

38:58.880 --> 39:01.879
No husband-o. No husband-o.

39:03.480 --> 39:04.879
ANNOUNCEMENT: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen ,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.119
and welcome to your flight
to London Heathrow.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.999
All right, now concentrate. The life
of Gwen Cooper - what do we know?

39:11.120 --> 39:12.959
Ex-police.

39:13.080 --> 39:17.959
It says that she joined
the Torchwood Institute in October, 2006.

39:18.080 --> 39:18.999
All right, now hold on, hold on.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.319
Go through her police records,
find out everyone she worked with,

39:21.440 --> 39:23.599
everyone she trained with.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.639
I'm sorry, sir. I have to ask you
to turn your phone off now.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.479
CIA...

39:27.600 --> 39:29.639
and I'm sick! Gwen Cooper.

39:29.760 --> 39:31.839
- Find out everything.
- I can't get into the database.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.479
I'll need your password.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.839
- (PHONE LINE DIES)
- Rex!

39:44.040 --> 39:45.319
Hi.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.759
So where the hell was I? Right.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.039
The password's Madrid,

39:50.160 --> 39:53.239
6-6-2-1 -1 .
That's Madrid with a capital M.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.599
Now go through that list

39:54.720 --> 39:56.919
and scan through their records
using a level-one filter.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.839
You should highlight
anything with a red flag

39:58.960 --> 40:01.719
or a caution
pertaining to homeland security.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.519
I've got one positive response.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.759
Police Sergeant Andrew Davidson,
Cardiff resident.

40:09.880 --> 40:13.759
There's a note in his file says
he was Gwen Cooper's unofficial liaison.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.239
I can access his private calls.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.399
I've got to filter this
through Whitehall.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.639
- Well, how long's it going to take?
- Any minute now.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.119
And what the hell is this bridge?

40:24.240 --> 40:26.799
- The Severn Bridge?
- It connects England to Wales.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.719
What, you mean Wales is separate?

40:30.440 --> 40:32.519
It's like the British equivalent
of New Jersey.

40:32.640 --> 40:33.879
Hold on, I think I've got something.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.399
Sergeant Davidson made one call
on Tuesday at 1 7.08

40:37.520 --> 40:39.239
to a number
that's on the UK Hickman register.

40:39.360 --> 40:42.639
That's a list of cell numbers allocated
to witness protection schemes.

40:42.760 --> 40:44.719
That's it, then, we've got her.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.799
I can request that through MI5.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.839
Now what is this?

40:48.960 --> 40:50.879
Wait a minute,
I've got to pay for this bridge?

40:52.400 --> 40:53.319
Goddamn Wales.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.879
I've traced the handset.
Sending you the coordinates...

40:56.920 --> 40:57.839
...now.

40:57.960 --> 41:02.439
It's at 5 1 degrees 34 north,
4 degrees 1 7 west.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.559
I got it.

41:18.160 --> 41:21.199
- CIA!
- Yeah? So what?

41:21.320 --> 41:23.999
(COUGHS)

41:27.240 --> 41:29.559
Extraordinary scenes in Kentucky

41:29.680 --> 41:33.319
as the governor's office releases
Oswald Danes on parole.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.959
The charity Freedom And Liberty
has employed a force majeure ruling

41:37.080 --> 41:39.999
to define Danes' survival
as an act of God

41:40.120 --> 41:43.159
with liability now on the state
to prove otherwise.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.799
(ANGRY SHOUTING)

42:01.400 --> 42:04.519
(BANGING)

42:05.600 --> 42:06.959
Right, we're off, we're going.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.759
We're going to get a good head start,
then phone you an ambulance.

42:08.880 --> 42:11.239
Don't follow us. Don't even try.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.319
We just want to be left alone, OK?

42:25.120 --> 42:26.919
Hold it right there, mate.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.679
- So much for tying him up.
- I've never tied up a person.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.479
Men are good at knots -
how many times have you told me that?

42:31.600 --> 42:32.519
Yeah, at Christmas.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.319
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:34.440 --> 42:36.679
I had a pole through my chest.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.559
I was dead, then I wasn't.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.399
I had to pay for this bridge

42:40.520 --> 42:44.319
and now I want to know
what the hell is going on, all right?

42:44.440 --> 42:47.919
- Because I was dead and now I'm not.
- (HELICOPTER APPROACHES)

42:48.040 --> 42:52.079
And if that has anything to do with
Torchwood or...or you or anyone,

42:52.200 --> 42:53.879
then I need...

42:54.000 --> 42:55.799
- (HELICOPTER NOISE INCREASES)
- You know, it would really help

42:55.920 --> 42:57.479
if could hear myself think.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.479
What the hell is he doing?

43:03.600 --> 43:05.079
It's a tourist thing.

43:06.200 --> 43:07.879
No.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.039
No, I don't think it is.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.719
Oh, sweetheart.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.159
Get back!

43:39.560 --> 43:41.959
GWEN: Get in the car! Come on!

43:44.600 --> 43:46.159
Come on!

44:00.080 --> 44:02.039
Can't leave you alone for a minute.

44:03.560 --> 44:04.559
It's you.

44:04.680 --> 44:08.039
Gwen Cooper - find out everything.

44:09.680 --> 44:11.559
She said to turn off the phone.

44:11.680 --> 44:12.919
Never annoy me again.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.399
- (HELICOPTER WHIRRS)
- Now get in.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.599
Duck!

44:32.440 --> 44:34.399
Jack, for God's sake,
there's a kid here!

44:34.520 --> 44:36.759
I got a present for you in the back.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.119
Give me her, Gwen, the baby!

44:38.240 --> 44:39.959
You there, CIA ,
do something useful!

44:40.080 --> 44:42.359
Wales is insane!

44:42.480 --> 44:44.079
Get down!

44:44.200 --> 44:45.599
Aaargh!

45:06.600 --> 45:07.559
- OK?
- I'm OK!

45:07.680 --> 45:09.439
- Who the hell are you people?
- Torchwood.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.279
ALL: Aaargh!

45:16.400 --> 45:18.799
(EXPLOSION)

45:23.240 --> 45:25.119
(GWEN COUGHS)

45:41.320 --> 45:43.999
Right. That's sorted. Rhys, take Anwen to
my mother's and keep her safe and sound.

45:44.120 --> 45:47.919
Jack, if you've got access
to any weapons, what else have we got?

45:48.040 --> 45:50.319
I've still got the old Eye-5s,
but everything else is gone.

45:50.440 --> 45:52.719
I knew it though. Didn't I say?

45:52.840 --> 45:55.959
The first sign of trouble, you go
running off with Captain Jack Bollocks.

45:56.080 --> 45:58.679
What choice have I got? They rebuilt
the tower, now we're rebuilding Torchwood.

45:58.800 --> 45:59.999
Isn't that right, Jack?

46:01.040 --> 46:03.079
- Are you even listening to me?
- I cut my arm.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.759
OK. Can't help but thinking
there's more important things

46:05.880 --> 46:07.159
- to be worrying about here.
- No.

46:07.280 --> 46:10.479
I cut my arm. Look at it.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.479
- It's not healing.
- Do you mean...

46:12.600 --> 46:14.319
- I'm staying hurt.
- Oh, my God.

46:14.440 --> 46:15.799
- I know.
- Seriously, though.

46:15.920 --> 46:17.439
- It's only a cut.
- But it's Jack.

46:17.560 --> 46:20.159
Don't you see?
The whole world becomes immortal...

46:20.280 --> 46:21.519
And I'm mortal.

46:21.640 --> 46:22.999
I don't mend.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.359
I'm normal again.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.519
I'm plain old human.

46:27.640 --> 46:30.359
- You're what?
- Doesn't concern you!

46:30.480 --> 46:32.759
You talk some crazy shit,
you know that?

46:32.880 --> 46:34.759
You should get that seen to.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.319
Yeah, any minute now.

46:36.440 --> 46:39.079
- (SIRENS APPROACH)
- Ah, there comes my ride.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.159
(GUNS COCK)

46:52.280 --> 46:53.599
Andy, you can't do this.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.839
Orders from above. I'm sorry.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.519
He's in charge.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.359
- Since when?
- He can't arrest us, he's American.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.359
I hate to bust up... Uh!
...your sweet little tea party,

47:03.480 --> 47:05.279
but this isn't an arrest,

47:05.400 --> 47:06.439
this is a rendition.

47:06.560 --> 47:08.599
And on behalf of the CIA...

47:08.720 --> 47:15.199
under the 456 Amendments
to US Code 3 1 84,

47:15.320 --> 47:18.239
I'm extraditing this
so-called Torchwood Team

47:18.360 --> 47:23.799
to the United States Of America.
Now...get me out of here!

47:25.000 --> 47:26.199
Take me home.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.759
- Everyone, we're doing it wrong!
- We don't have time.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.719
We have nothing buttime.
Nobody's going to die.

47:48.840 --> 47:51.199
OSWALD DANES: Something happened
to all of us, not just me.

47:51.320 --> 47:53.039
Miracle Day arrived, and...

47:54.360 --> 47:56.319
...we all came out of it changed.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.559
This woman's husband strangled her.

47:58.680 --> 48:00.279
She doesn't die,
so he keeps strangling her.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.359
And you're telling me that's not murder?

48:01.480 --> 48:02.999
We're not allowed to say
"attempted murder" any more,

48:03.120 --> 48:05.239
because murder's impossible.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.919
Hospital beds are filling up because
the people who should die, don't.

48:08.040 --> 48:11.679
Give it six months, and drug-resistant
organisms will be everywhere.

48:11.800 --> 48:14.559
People aren't just living.
It's like they're too alive.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.799
Whichever way you look at it,
this situation can only get worse.

48:18.880 --> 48:20.119
I'm arresting Torchwood now.

48:20.240 --> 48:22.119
Whoa! Hey, what you doing?

48:22.240 --> 48:24.679
I'm coming back, all right?

48:24.800 --> 48:27.559
Every time you turn up,
it always goes wrong.

48:27.680 --> 48:30.719
Oh, my God, Rex is coming back
and he's bringing Torchwood with him.

48:30.840 --> 48:33.639
Hey, wait! You get us arrested, OK?
You break up my family,

48:33.760 --> 48:34.879
you nearly get Jack killed.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.479
- Why should we go anywhere with you?
- Because I have a car.

48:44.200 --> 48:46.399
Go, go, go, go, go!

48:46.520 --> 48:49.399
Who told you to set me up?
Because everywhere I turn, the whole CIA

48:49.520 --> 48:50.919
has been poisoned against me.

48:51.040 --> 48:55.239
I don't know who they are! They...
They've been there for...for decades.

48:55.360 --> 48:58.759
They were ready for the miracle.
PhiCorp knew it was coming.

48:58.880 --> 49:01.519
ESTHER: Looks like PhiCorp's
calling them overflow camps

49:01.640 --> 49:02.959
for all the patients in ICU.

49:03.080 --> 49:05.159
There's one thing
you have got to sort out, OK?

49:05.280 --> 49:07.359
- And that's my dad.
- But he's safe enough, Gwen.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.279
GWEN: This is bloody PhiCorp, Rhys,
and they are up to something.

49:11.640 --> 49:15.039
GWEN: The new cult out on the street -
that march? They call themselves...

49:15.160 --> 49:17.039
the Soulless.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.719
It's like there's some sort
of energy behind this.

49:19.840 --> 49:22.359
A will, a drive, a consciousness.

49:22.480 --> 49:26.759
Cos this miracle, it's more than people
just surviving - they are so alive.

49:26.880 --> 49:30.759
These are the times that make men,
Oswald. So it's your choice -

49:30.880 --> 49:35.359
stay where you are, or stand up tall
and stride across the skin of the world.

49:36.560 --> 49:38.439
Did you see Oswald Danes?

49:38.560 --> 49:39.679
Did you touch him?

49:39.800 --> 49:43.519
- You're obsessed with this bastard.
- He's blazing away.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.839
Patterns are starting
to revolve around him,

49:45.960 --> 49:48.919
and all we have to do
is keep watching.

49:49.040 --> 49:53.719
The truth is, I know what I am
and I know what you are too.

49:53.840 --> 50:00.839
Because I know for certain...
what has happened to the human race.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.679
Whatever's happening to this planet,
it is massive.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.759
PEOPLE SHOUT: Oswald!

50:13.680 --> 50:15.039
Aaaargh!

50:19.680 --> 50:21.159
DR JUAREZ: I'm joining the cause.

50:21.280 --> 50:24.279
Whatever you're doing
to fight this miracle, count me in.

50:38.840 --> 50:40.039
Gwen!

50:43.480 --> 50:46.039
If you're the best England's
got to offer, then God help you.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.359
I'm Welsh.
