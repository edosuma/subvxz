11:21.681 --> 11:24.584
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.887
MR. TORKLE, THE RACE
JUST STARTED.

11:26.954 --> 11:30.390
DARLIN', WHEN MY OWN CAR
IS ON THAT TRACK,

11:30.457 --> 11:34.261
I'LL WATCH THE RACE.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.202
I DON'T DRINK.
YOU DON'T?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.571
NO.

11:44.637 --> 11:48.075
I'M A SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER.
THAT WAS ON MY RESUME.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.411
OH, YEAH, SURE.
OF COURSE.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.480
OF COURSE.

12:11.164 --> 12:15.936
LUGS, WHO'S
DRIVING NUMBER 10?

12:16.003 --> 12:17.938
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.
THAT'S AUBREY JAMES.

12:18.005 --> 12:21.842
HE'S BEEN TRYING
TO KILL YOU FOR YEARS.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.177
I ALREADY
GOT BLISTERS
ON MY HANDS.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.246
TO DRIVE THIS
500 MORE MILES,

12:26.313 --> 12:28.248
I'D HAVE TO BE
KING KONG.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.450
IT SHOULDN'T BE
ANY PROBLEM.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.854
YOU BOTH GOT
THE SAME IQ.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.356
VERY FUNNY!

12:41.361 --> 12:43.997
OH! AUBREY JAMES,
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RACETRACK,

12:44.064 --> 12:46.033
CUTS INTO
HARRY GANT'S AUTOMOBILE!

12:46.099 --> 12:50.570
STROKER ACE TO THE OUTSIDE,
SPINNING WILDLY!

12:50.637 --> 12:52.772
THERE'S FIVE, SIX,
SEVEN AUTOMOBILES,

12:52.840 --> 12:54.307
SLIPPING, SLIDING--

12:54.374 --> 12:55.608
INTO THE WALL!

12:55.675 --> 13:00.013
HE SHORTENED THAT AUTOMOBILE
ABOUT 1 1/2 FEET!

13:00.080 --> 13:02.015
STROKER ACE IN
A MAJOR ALTERCATION

13:02.082 --> 13:05.953
WITH AUBREY JAMES
AND HARRY GANT...

13:06.019 --> 13:08.488
A SEND-TOW VACATION
DOWN IN TURN NUMBER ONE!

13:08.555 --> 13:10.757
I'M SURE ALL OF YOU
STROKER ACE FANS

13:10.824 --> 13:13.660
ARE WONDERING
JUST HOW STROKER IS.

13:13.726 --> 13:17.430
WE'LL GET YOU A REPORT
ON HE AND THE OTHER DRIVERS

13:17.497 --> 13:20.133
FROM DOWN IN TURN ONE.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.361
WHO SET UP THE CAR,
DRUG ADDICTS?

13:48.428 --> 13:49.696
YOU JUST LOST IT.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.765
I DIDN'T LOSE IT!
HOW DO I LOOK?

13:52.832 --> 13:53.934
WHY?

13:54.001 --> 13:56.803
TV CAMERAS.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.172
AN EARLY PEDESTRIAN
HERE IN THE 500,

13:59.239 --> 14:02.375
THE WELL-KNOWN
STROKER ACE.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.676
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:03.743 --> 14:06.880
ONE OF THE TIRES EQUALIZED
AND SHOVED ME
INTO THE WALL.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.918
YOU WERE FIGHTING
THE AUTOMOBILE
FROM THE BEGINNING.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.653
NOT TRUE.
WHEN LUGS HARVEY
SETS UP A CAR,

14:13.720 --> 14:15.455
YOUR MOTHER
COULD DRIVE IT.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.857
LUGS HARVEY, MECHANIC
FOR STROKER ACE,
HOW ABOUT IT?

14:17.925 --> 14:21.261
IF STROKER CAN'T
DRIVE A CAR,
NOBODY CAN.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.363
THAT'S THE STORY FROM
THE VETERAN STROKER ACE

14:23.430 --> 14:27.234
AND HIS VENERABLE CHIEF
MECHANIC LUGS HARVEY.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.439
JUST ONCE, I WISH YOU WOULD
TELL US THE REAL STORY.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.910
YOU WRECK
YOUR RACE CAR,

14:36.977 --> 14:39.879
YOUR RENTAL CAR,
YOUR HOTEL ROOM.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.214
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.350
WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE GOIN'!

14:43.416 --> 14:45.552
THIS CAR'S

14:45.618 --> 14:46.886
YES, MR. COTY.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.221

14:48.288 --> 14:51.224

JUST THIS FAR!

14:58.665 --> 15:02.102
YOU WANT TO LOSE
BIG "Z" OIL,
STROKE, OLD BOY?

15:03.570 --> 15:04.871
NO, SIR.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.374
I'LL GO GET MY KEY,

15:07.440 --> 15:09.642
AND THEN I'LL DRIVE YOU

15:09.709 --> 15:12.946
WELL, GET MY KEY, TOO.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.382
YES, SIR.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.517
NOW, THAT'S
MORE LIKE IT.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.687
MR. ACE FINALLY
UNDERSTANDS THAT
THIS IS A BUSINESS.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.691
AND IN A BUSINESS,
YOU DON'T ACT
LIKE A MANIAC.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.693
NICE MEETIN' YOU,
MR. COTY.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.195
CATTY!

15:30.663 --> 15:32.966
OH, MY GOODNESS!

15:33.033 --> 15:34.267

15:34.334 --> 15:38.371
I'LL GET YOU!
YOU'LL NEVER RIDE AGAIN!

15:38.438 --> 15:40.940
GET ME OUT!

15:41.008 --> 15:44.011
YOU'LL GET IT!

15:44.077 --> 15:45.812
WOO!

15:45.878 --> 15:49.049
I'LL GET YOU,
YOU SON--

15:49.116 --> 15:50.417
HA HA HA!

15:52.819 --> 15:56.289
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
FILL UP HIS CAR
WITH CEMENT?

15:56.356 --> 16:00.893
BECAUSE A MAN'S GOT TO DO
WHAT HE'S GOT TO DO.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.630
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A SPONSOR,
THE SEASON'S ALREADY STARTED.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.666
YOU DON'T EVER
THINK OF ANYBODY
BUT YOURSELF.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.101
HOLD IT.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.071
SEE THAT GUY
OVER THERE?

16:11.138 --> 16:14.174
HE'S GOT MY EXACT
SAME SHIRT ON.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.609
I OUGHT TO GO BACK
IN THE ROOM AND CHANGE.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.979
WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT
OF SPONSORS SOMEDAY.

16:20.047 --> 16:23.683
I WONDER WHAT
HE PAID FOR THAT.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.686
O.K.,
WHO'S GONNA BUY
THE WINNER A DRINK?

16:28.121 --> 16:30.390
O.K., I'LL HAVE
TWO BEERS.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.759

HE'S WITH MY GIRL.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.256
WHAT'S HER NAME?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.258
I DON'T KNOW
HER FIRST NAME.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.027
LAST TIME I SAW HER,
HER SASH SAID
"MISS DAYTONA."

17:08.095 --> 17:10.130
THAT'S PROBABLY
HER LAST NAME.

17:10.196 --> 17:15.734

24:15.722 --> 24:17.289
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

24:17.356 --> 24:18.725
OF COURSE.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.594
IS THAT
YOUR REAL VOICE?

24:21.661 --> 24:25.231
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.934

OUR SALES HAVE
STEADILY INCREASED
SINCE 1967.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.931
OUR SALES MATCHED

25:31.998 --> 25:34.667

PURCHASING BROKE OUT

25:34.734 --> 25:36.769

25:52.885 --> 25:55.622
I MIGHT DO ONE COMMERCIAL
IF IT'S CLASSY.

25:55.688 --> 25:58.958
I WANT "FASTEST CHICKEN
IN THE SOUTH" OFF MY CAR.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.559
I'M SORRY. THAT'S
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE.

26:00.627 --> 26:03.162
YOU HAVE A WHOLE
SCHEDULE OF PERSONAL
APPEARANCES.

26:03.229 --> 26:08.400
I'LL TRAVEL
WITH YOU TO
ARRANGE EVERYTHING.

26:08.467 --> 26:09.435
TRAVEL WITH ME?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.776
WELL, THEN, WE'LL BE
SHARING A ROOM, RIGHT?

26:16.843 --> 26:18.878
NO. WE COULDN'T
DO THAT.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.280
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.514
WHAT A LITTLE KIDDER!

26:22.581 --> 26:24.383
WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH IT?

26:24.450 --> 26:30.723
I COULDN'T SHARE
A ROOM WITH A MAN
I'M NOT MARRIED TO.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.191
AND YOU NEVER
BEEN MARRIED?

26:32.258 --> 26:33.492
NO.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.294
THAT MAKES YOU A, UH...

A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.229
A BEAUTIFUL VOICE, YES,

27:10.296 --> 27:13.833
BUT I MEAN THE MOUTH...
DOESN'T WORK RIGHT.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.102
THE LIPS AREN'T UNDER
THE NOSE WHEN HE SINGS.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.370
THEY'RE HERE
ON THE SIDE OF HIS FACE.

27:18.437 --> 27:22.675
THEY ARE NOT!

27:22.742 --> 27:25.111
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

27:25.177 --> 27:28.414
O.K. YOU CAN ASK ME
ANYTHING.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.649
ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE
NEVER SLEPT WITH ANYBODY?

27:30.717 --> 27:32.118
MAYBE THERE WAS
SOMEBODY YOU FORGOT.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.854
STROKER ACE,
I'D BE ASHAMED!

27:34.921 --> 27:39.325
HOW COULD YOU ASK HER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

27:39.391 --> 27:41.093
I'M SORRY.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.595
JUST NERVOUS. I'LL BE MAKING
THIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE...

27:46.866 --> 27:50.870
I'M SORRY.
GO AHEAD AND SING.

27:50.937 --> 27:54.240
Watch his mouth.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.393
SUM UP IN A FEW
WELL-CHOSEN WORDS

31:34.460 --> 31:38.497
THE ESSENCE

GO DOWN TO THE END
OF THE STRAIGHTAWAY

31:41.733 --> 31:44.536
UNLESS YOU'RE NUMBER 10.
THEN YOU TURN RIGHT.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.838
WHO'S NUMBER 10?

31:46.905 --> 31:50.542
Who is number 10?

A CHIEF MECHANIC DO?

32:01.920 --> 32:02.955

EVERYTHING IS RIGHT.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.229
BUT I'M ALSO

32:10.296 --> 32:13.665
EVERYBODY AROUND THE PITS

* AMAZIN' GRACE *

32:16.168 --> 32:18.304

33:01.213 --> 33:03.215
WHO'S NEXT?

33:03.282 --> 33:04.683
THAT LOW-CLASS
SON OF A BUCK

33:04.750 --> 33:07.553
DOESN'T KNOW
WHO HE'S DEALING WITH.

33:07.619 --> 33:11.823
FOUR DIFFERENT LAWYERS
SAID THE SAME THING.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.859
CLYDE TORKLE'S
GOT TO FIRE YOU.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.794

A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DIGNITY

33:20.366 --> 33:22.701
AND A PRETTY GOOD
SELF-IMAGE.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.070
I KNOW WHAT I AM.

33:24.136 --> 33:27.073
I'M A RACE CAR DRIVER.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.941
I AIN'T NO DAMN CHICKEN.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.543
BAWK! BAWK! BAWK!

33:31.610 --> 33:32.878
I'M STROKER ACE.

33:32.944 --> 33:36.148
THE ONLY THING I LIKE
BETTER THAN WINNING A RACE

33:36.215 --> 33:39.885
IS TO STUFF TORKLE CHICKEN
IN MY FACE.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.388
IT'S NOT
VERY DIGNIFIED,
IS IT?

33:42.454 --> 33:46.092

IN HIS CHICKEN OUTFIT.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.627
TRY HARDER.
WE COULD DO BETTER.

33:48.694 --> 33:49.961
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

33:50.028 --> 33:52.664
NO.

33:52.731 --> 33:53.932
YOU HAVE TO.

33:53.999 --> 33:54.966
IT'S IN
YOUR CONTRACT.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.202
I DON'T GIVE A TURKEY.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.304
I DID SOME
DUMB THINGS IN MY LIFE,

33:58.370 --> 34:01.440
BUT THIS IS THE DUMBEST!

34:01.507 --> 34:03.075
I KNOW
IT'S IN MY CONTRACT

34:03.142 --> 34:07.113

34:07.179 --> 34:11.083
I'M GOING TO SELL IT
SO HARD HE'LL CHOKE
TO DEATH ON IT!

34:19.056 --> 34:21.493
YOU DRIVE.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.266
LOOK AT THIS.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.768
MUST BE SOME NEW
KIND OF CULT.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.804
BOO!
BOO!

34:37.176 --> 34:39.545

COME AND GO

34:39.610 --> 34:41.547

GRAND NATIONAL RACING,

A VERY MOVING EXPERIENCE

58:53.363 --> 58:58.168
FOR BOTH OF US.

58:58.235 --> 58:59.203
WAKE UP.

58:59.269 --> 59:00.571
WAKE UP.

59:00.638 --> 59:02.807
WAKE UP.

59:10.014 --> 59:11.649
I'M GOING TO
GO TO MY ROOM.

59:11.716 --> 59:15.319
I'M NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING
THAT I'M GOING TO BE SORRY FOR.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.321
GOOD NIGHT. DAMN!

59:22.392 --> 59:24.028
I GUESS
I SHOULD UNDRESS YOU.

59:24.094 --> 59:27.998
I MEAN, PEOPLE DON'T SLEEP
WITH THEIR CLOTHES ON.

59:29.199 --> 59:32.136
I MEAN, NOBODY SLEEPS
WITH THEIR CLOTHES ON.

59:32.202 --> 59:35.840
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE
SLEEPING IN CLOTHES.

59:35.906 --> 59:38.008
PEOPLE SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE
WHEN THEY SLEEP.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.444
I'M GOING TO CLOSE
MY EYES,

59:40.510 --> 59:42.446
AND THEN--OOH!

59:42.512 --> 59:44.081
WHAT IS THIS, A BUTTON?

59:44.148 --> 59:45.149
I'M GOING TO LOOK.

59:45.215 --> 59:49.219
THIS COULD BE SOMETHING
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.

59:49.286 --> 59:50.888
NO. THIS IS A BUTTON.

59:50.955 --> 59:52.890
I'LL JUST UNDO THAT

59:52.957 --> 59:55.660
AND JUST PULL THAT
RIGHT OFF THERE.

59:55.726 --> 59:58.763
NOW YOU'LL BE
C-COMFORTABLE.

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:05.903
I'M GOING TO GO NOW.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.139
I'M DEFINITELY
GOING TO GO NOW.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:11.608
YEP.

01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:14.178
I'M GOING TO GO.

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:19.917
HOW IS THIS
GOING TO LOOK?

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:21.952
I MEAN,
YOU'RE HALF UNDRESSED.

01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:24.054
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU
LIKE THIS.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:28.759
I'LL JUST--I'LL JUST UNDO
THE REST OF YOU,

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:32.997
AND THEN YOU'LL BE...
YOU KNOW, AIR-COOLED.

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:35.432
IT'S SILLY
TO LEAVE YOU LIKE THIS...

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.634
WITH HALF THE DRESS

01:00:37.702 --> 01:00:40.070
AND--OH!

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:50.981
I'M GOING TO GO.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:51.982
I AM.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:54.985
I'M GOING TO GO
TO MY ROOM.

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:58.055
TAKE ANOTHER--
ANOTHER COLD SHOWER.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:00.290
YEP.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:05.963
I WAS READING
IN A MEDICAL JOURNAL
THE OTHER DAY

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:09.967
ABOUT HOW BRASSIERES
CUT THE CIRCULATION OFF
IN YOUR BODY.

01:01:11.368 --> 01:01:15.906
IT'S NOT A GOOD THING.

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:19.009
I MEAN, A PERSON COULD DIE
WITH ONE OF THESE THINGS ON.

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.878
THE BLOOD DOESN'T
GET TO YOUR HEAD.

01:01:20.945 --> 01:01:23.447
I'LL JUST TAKE THIS OFF,

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.682
THEN TAKE OFF...

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:30.821
THIS WOULD BE MORE FUN
IF YOU WERE HERE.

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:37.862
I MEAN, I COULD
JUST RAVAGE YOU, ANYWAY.

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:42.299
WHO WOULD KNOW?

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.342
* HAPPY ORANGE JUICE
TO YOU *

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:55.579
STROKER?
HMM?

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.647
DID WE--

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.784
I MEAN...

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.886
DID IT HAPPEN?

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:06.656
YOU MEAN
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW?

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.592
I GUESS NOT.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.995
YOU GUESS NOT?

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:16.133
NOTHING HAPPENED.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.436
OH.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:21.371
YOU ARE SO SWEET...

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:25.009
THAT YOU COULD HAVE
AND YOU DIDN'T.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:29.046
WELL, THAT'S PART OF
THE WONDERFULNESS OF ME.

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:33.683
YOU ARE
THE MOST WONDERFUL MAN.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.519
I GOT TO MAKE
A PHONE CALL.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.055
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:02:54.471 --> 01:02:56.173
HEY, PEMBROOK.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.507
OH, HI, LUGS.

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:03.113
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HON?

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.116
IT'S STROKER.
HE'S JUST...

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:06.951
WHERE IS HE?

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:09.319
HE IS MAKING
A PHONE CALL.

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:13.023
HEY, DOC.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:16.226
ARE YOU REALLY
A GOOD ACTOR?

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:17.862
I NEED HELP
WITH MY CONTRACT.

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:20.130
STROKER,
COME ON OUT HERE!

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:21.932
IT'S A HELL
OF AN IDEA.

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:23.167
IN A SECOND, LUGS.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.836
RIGHT NOW!

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.644
UH, DOC...

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:37.948
DOC, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:39.783
DOC, I GOT THIS IDEA

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:42.086
ON HOW TO GET OUT
OF MY CONTRACT.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:48.225
MR. MacKENZIE...
HOT DAMN!

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:51.028
FOR A LITTLE
REDNECK COMPANY
LIKE MINE,

01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:56.633
IT'S SOMETHIN' TO BE TALKIN'
TO YOU YANKEE BOYS
FROM MILWAUKEE.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.504
WE'RE IMPRESSED WITH
YOUR COMPANY GROWTH,
MR. TORKLE.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.240
THAT'S REALLY SOMETHIN',
ISN'T IT,
COMIN' FROM YOU?

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:07.477
YOU'VE DONE WELL
THESE PAST FEW MONTHS,
PARTICULARLY.

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:08.645
HOW COULD YOU
KNOW THAT?

01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:11.415
'CAUSE THAT'S SECRET
COMPANY INFORMATION.

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:14.218
BELIEVE ME,
WE KNOW.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:17.721

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:24.094
WE WANT TO BUY
YOUR COMPANY.

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:28.498
WELL, IT'S NOT
FOR SALE.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:30.867
WELL, I'VE WRITTEN
DOWN A FIGURE

01:04:30.935 --> 01:04:33.570
ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:48.852
I THINK THAT FIGURE'S
JUST A LITTLE LOW,
MR. MacKENZIE.

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:50.454
THAT'S EXACTLY
10% HIGHER

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.722
THAN THIS COMPANY'S
TOTAL WORTH...

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:54.658
TO THE EXACT CENT.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.726
20% OVER STOCK VALUE.

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:59.463
DAMN!

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:02.066

ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE.

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.372
A DR. PEPPER.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:13.978
WHAT'S A GOOD OL' BOY
FROM THE BREWIN' COMPANY

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:16.346
DOIN' DRINKIN'

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:20.584

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:36.800
I GOT YOU.

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:40.637
You're going to
buy them out, too,
ain't you?

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:43.240

01:05:43.307 --> 01:05:44.641

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:49.079
WELL, I'M NOT AT LIBERTY
TO DISCUSS THAT.

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:52.649
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:53.950
THEN I HOPE
YOU UNDERSTAND

01:05:54.018 --> 01:05:55.385
THERE ARE
A FEW STIPULATIONS

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.620
TO MY OFFER.

01:05:56.686 --> 01:06:00.657
FOREMOST,
YOU TELL NOBODY
ABOUT THIS.

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:04.028
DO I LOOK LIKE
A BIGMOUTH?

01:06:04.094 --> 01:06:06.196
SECONDLY,
IF YOU SELL,

01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:08.032

CAN YOU
GET RID OF HIM?

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:24.014

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:35.192
I CAN'T DO THAT.

01:06:35.259 --> 01:06:38.995
WE HAVE NO DEAL,

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:14.431

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:18.568
HE'LL DISCOVER
THERE'S NO DEAL.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:19.736

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:36.953
HE HIT ME.
I CAN'T REMEMBER
HIS NAME.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.322
YOU NEVER CAN.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:40.724
HE SPUN ME OUT.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:41.958
STICK HIM

01:07:42.025 --> 01:07:44.728
GOOD IDEA, NEIL.

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:09.799
LATER TODAY WE WILL HAVE
A NEW NATIONAL CHAMPION.

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:12.268
WORKING WITH ME
IS BILL DOLLAR AND DAVID HOBBS.

01:11:12.336 --> 01:11:14.471
WE'LL BE BACK AFTER THIS.

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:20.276
TELL MR. BIG
TO COME HERE

01:11:20.344 --> 01:11:22.512
TO SAY HELLO
TO THESE PEOPLE
IF HE WINS.

01:11:22.579 --> 01:11:24.348
FIVE HOURS IN A RACE
IS TIRING.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:25.382
I DON'T THINK--

01:11:25.449 --> 01:11:27.851
I DON'T PAY YOU TO THINK.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:30.019
JUST DELIVER THE MESSAGE.

01:11:30.086 --> 01:11:32.021
HEY!

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:34.023
WHERE THE HELL
IS MY BLIMP?

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:35.859
THERE IT IS.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:36.993
OH!

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.128
THERE IT IS.
I LOVE IT!

01:11:39.195 --> 01:11:42.065
THAT'S ME! I LOVE IT!

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.900
I WANT YOU
FOURTH OR FIFTH,

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:47.103
BUT NOT TOO FAR BACK.

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:48.271
GUM!

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:50.273
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.576
WHERE IS IT?

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:54.844
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHETHER I WIN OR LOSE.

01:12:03.887 --> 01:12:07.424
THE FIELD BEGINS TO ROLL
DOWN PIT ROW.

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:14.364
A KALEIDOSCOPE OF COLORS,

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:17.867
READY TO DO BATTLE
FOR 500 MILES.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.637
COMING DOWN TO
THIS LAST RACE,

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:23.139
FOUR MEN ARE IN THE RUNNING
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP--

01:12:23.206 --> 01:12:26.910
STROKER ACE, AUBREY JAMES,
HARRY GANT, AND CALE YARBOROUGH.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:30.980
WHO WILL WIN?

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:33.116
THERE ARE RUMORS
OF A FEUD

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.718
BETWEEN STROKER ACE
AND JAMES.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:36.185
THAT COULD AFFECT
THE OUTCOME.

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.954
BILL KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THAT.

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:39.723
I ASKED
STROKER ACE.

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:40.957
HE ANSWERED,
"WHAT FEUD?"

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:42.091
WE'LL FIND OUT.

01:12:42.158 --> 01:12:45.829
THE CARS ARE WAITING
FOR THE GREEN FLAG.

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:49.733
FIELD ON THE TOW
OF THE PACE CAR.

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:52.335
MOVING INTO
THE FOURTH CORNER,

01:12:52.402 --> 01:12:54.237
THEY'RE LESS THAN 1,000 FEET

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:57.641
AWAY FROM THE START
OF THIS $500,000 CHASE,

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.676
THE FINAL RACE
OF THE SEASON,

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:01.611
THE CHAMPIONSHIP
ON THE LINE.

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:03.947
HERE COME THE WARLORDS.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.422
THE PACE CAR PULLS OFF
ONTO PIT ROW.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:13.457
HERE THEY COME...

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:15.459
LESS THAN 500 FEET

01:13:15.525 --> 01:13:19.028
FROM HAROLD KINDER
HOLDING THEM DOWN.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:48.492
OUT OF TURN FOUR,
THEY'RE BACK TO THE STRIPE.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:51.094
LOOK AT THAT DRAFT
UP FRONT!

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.430
SHEPARD, CALE YARBOROUGH,
AND HARRY GANT!

01:13:54.498 --> 01:13:56.666
ARE THEY SETTING
A BLISTERING PACE!

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:58.668
WE'RE EARLY IN
THIS 500-MILE RACE

01:13:58.735 --> 01:14:01.204
AT CHARLOTTE MOTOR SPEEDWAY.

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:13.082
STROKER ACE
IS MOVING TO THE FRONT.

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:16.820
TALK ABOUT A GUY
DRIVING HIS HEART OUT.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:20.657
STROKER ACE
HAS WORKED HIS WAY
IN FRONT OF THE FIELD.

01:14:22.726 --> 01:14:24.894
YOU GUYS ARE SETTING
A NEW TRACK RECORD.

01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:26.329
DAMN!

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.297
GET SOME CAUTION FLAGS,

01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:31.067
THE RACE COULD LAST
TILL 4:30.

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:45.448
STROKER MUST BE
IN TROUBLE.

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:48.652
HE'S BEEN PASSED
BY FOUR CARS.

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:51.287
WE'LL KEEP YOU
INFORMED.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:52.956
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:56.893
GETTIN' OUT
OF THE CHICKEN BUSINESS.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.262
STROKER,
THIS IS HUMILIATING.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.565
WELL, THEN DON'T WATCH!

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:05.802
WHAT IS HE DOIN'?

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:12.275
I'LL BE DAMNED.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:16.012
MR. ALL-AMERICAN HERO
IS GOIN' IN THE TANK.

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:18.481
MR. TORKLE!

01:15:18.548 --> 01:15:19.949
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.719
THAT SAYS HE'S FROM
THE BREWING COMPANY.

01:15:26.923 --> 01:15:30.193
FIRST CAUTION OF THE AFTERNOON
AT CHARLOTTE MOTOR SPEEDWAY.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:34.598
THE STRATEGY HAS CHANGED
FOR THIS RACE--

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:38.234
A TIME STRATEGY,
NOT A SPEED BATTLE.

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:39.569
THE LEADERS COME IN.

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:41.437
WHAT A BREAK
FOR STROKER ACE,

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:43.439
WHO WAS ALMOST
1/2 LAP BACK.

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:47.777
HE MAY MAKE UP
THAT 1/2 LAP...

01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:51.715
HOPEFULLY GET SERVICE
FOR THE PROBLEM.

01:16:00.824 --> 01:16:03.059
STROKER, YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING ME!

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:10.166
YOU GOT THE KEY
TO THE REST ROOM?

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:13.670
I GUESS NOT. HA HA!

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:44.367
YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T
LIKE A MILLER'S?

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:45.702
FOUR?

01:16:45.769 --> 01:16:47.370
OH, YEAH. 4:00.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:50.640
HELL, WE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME.

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:54.010
LISTEN, WHERE IS
THAT GUY MacKENZIE?

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:55.444
I KNOW NOTHING.

01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:57.046
I AM MERELY
THE MESSENGER.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.247
I KNOW. I KNOW.

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:00.249
YOU SAID THAT BEFORE.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.656
[WHISTLES]

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:10.026
A REAL BATTLE,

01:17:10.093 --> 01:17:12.028
BUT THE HEATED BATTLE
IS UP FRONT.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:14.530
YARBOROUGH AND GANT
KEEP SWAPPING THAT LEAD,

01:17:14.597 --> 01:17:16.866
LAP AFTER LAP AFTER LAP.

01:17:19.402 --> 01:17:20.670
WHAT'S STROKER DOING?

01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:22.872
DON'T WORRY.
RUN YOUR RACE.

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:23.907
AAH!

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:35.685
WE'RE SEEING
SOME BLAZING SPEED.

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:40.289
THE AVERAGE
IS 154.25 MILES AN HOUR.

01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:42.826
UNLESS WE HAVE
A WRECK,

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:45.428
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE FASTEST 500-MILE RACE.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:48.264
* CHANCES ARE

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:50.934
* THOUGH I WEAR
A SILLY GRIN *

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.969
* THE MOMENT YOU
COME INTO-- *

01:17:53.036 --> 01:17:54.070
[BUMP]

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.381
WOO!

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:24.133
LUGS!

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.102
WHAT?

01:18:26.169 --> 01:18:29.505
I JUST MADE
A CORPORATE DECISION.

01:18:29.572 --> 01:18:32.909
I AM CHOOSING
TO WIN THIS DAMN RACE.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:36.846
SELL CHICKEN
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS?

01:18:37.781 --> 01:18:39.015
YEAH!

01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:02.338
I KNEW IT.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:04.307
I KNEW HE COULDN'T
STAND TO BE BEATEN.

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.442
YOU KNOW WHAT
HIS PROBLEM IS?

01:19:06.509 --> 01:19:08.878
GOT TOO MUCH EGO.

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:11.981
FINE. NEXT YEAR
WE'LL OPEN THE RIB PITS.

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:14.317
WA-HOO!

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:15.985
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:17.987
THAT BATTLE UP FRONT
IS UNREAL.

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:19.488
GANT IS YOUR LEADER.

01:19:19.555 --> 01:19:21.891
STROKER ACE
HAS MOVED INTO SECOND.

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:46.749
MOVE!

01:19:46.816 --> 01:19:49.485
OH, HELL.
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:19:59.628
OH!

01:19:59.695 --> 01:20:00.964
OH!
OOH!

01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:27.656
THE CAUTION IS OUT...

01:20:27.723 --> 01:20:32.028
THE WAY THEY WERE RUNNING,
IT HAD TO HAPPEN.

01:20:32.095 --> 01:20:34.030
NO RECORD RACE TODAY.

01:20:34.097 --> 01:20:36.032
IT TOOK OUT
HARRY GANT.

01:20:36.099 --> 01:20:38.301
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE--

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:41.104
CALE YARBOROUGH,
AUBREY JAMES,
AND STROKER.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.572
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:44.807
EVERYTHING'S O.K.

01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:47.343
AUBREY JAMES JUST GOT
A LITTLE AMBITIOUS.

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:50.980
HE'S COMIN' IN!

01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:03.092
HURRY UP!
NUMBER 10 IS LEAVING!

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:04.961
WE'LL BEAT HIM.

01:21:05.028 --> 01:21:07.330
THE JACK'S BROKE!

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:08.731
BROKE!

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:11.067
GO BORROW ONE!

01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:22.211
HELLO, ARNOLD.
YOU DO THIS OFTEN?

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:24.880
JUST WANT TO BE
ON THE WINNIN' TEAM.

01:21:24.948 --> 01:21:27.083
WE GOT
A NEW JACK MAN!

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:38.394
THE YELLOW
IS STILL OUT.

01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:41.130
STROKER ACE
IS GETTING IN LINE...

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:42.598
IN SIXTH PLACE.

01:21:42.665 --> 01:21:45.268
TWELVE LAPS TO GO.

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:48.404
WITH FEW LAPS
AND STIFF COMPETITION,

01:21:48.471 --> 01:21:50.806
STROKER'S CHANCES
ARE SLIM TO NONE.

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:54.010
THAT JACK PROBLEM
DROPPED STROKER TO SIXTH PLACE.

01:21:54.077 --> 01:21:57.080
AUBREY JAMES PASSED HIM
AND TOOK THE LEAD.

01:21:57.146 --> 01:21:59.615
CALE YARBOROUGH'S CAR
IS IN THE PITS.

01:21:59.682 --> 01:22:00.883
HE'S OUT OF IT.

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:04.720
HEY, YOU!

01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:07.056
I KNOW NOTHING.
I AM MERELY--

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:10.359
A MESSENGER.
YES, SIR.
HERE IS THE MESSAGE.

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:12.728
CALL THOSE GOOD OL' BOYS
IN MILWAUKEE.

01:22:12.795 --> 01:22:15.431
TELL THEM
THEY GOT A DEAL.

01:22:24.407 --> 01:22:27.176
IT HAS BEEN
A WILD AFTERNOON.

01:22:27.243 --> 01:22:29.178
THE GREEN IS BACK OUT.

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:32.948
THE BATTLE SHAPES UP
AT TURN ONE.

01:22:33.016 --> 01:22:36.019
DAD JUST CALLED!

01:22:36.085 --> 01:22:38.621
HEY, STROKER!
DAD CALLED AND SAID,

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.756
"STAND ON IT, SON!"

01:22:40.823 --> 01:22:42.992
THIS IS AS GOOD
AS IT GETS.

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:10.053
STROKER ACE IS PASSING CARS
IN WHOLESALE FASHION.

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.407
HEY, PRESS BOYS!

01:23:31.474 --> 01:23:33.442
YOU'RE HERE TO GET
THE NEWS, AIN'T YOU?

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:37.713
I GOT AN EXCLUSIVE FOR YOU.

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.115
AS OF THIS MOMENT,

01:23:39.182 --> 01:23:42.285
STROKER ACE IS NO LONGER
DRIVING FOR ME.

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:44.420
HE'S THROUGH.
HE'S RELEASED.

01:23:44.487 --> 01:23:47.890
OFF THE RECORD,
HE'S ON HIS BUTT

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:50.659
BECAUSE HE NO LONGER
REPRESENTS

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:53.696
THE CLYDE TORKLE
CHICKEN PIT IMAGE.

01:23:59.302 --> 01:24:02.805
WHY FIRE HIM
WHEN HE'S IN SECOND PLACE?

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:03.839
WHAT?

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:07.243
HE MOVED INTO
SECOND PLACE.

01:24:45.848 --> 01:24:48.651
IT STARTED OUT
WITH FOUR, THEN THREE,
NOW IT'S TWO.

01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:50.219
THE ONLY THING

01:24:50.286 --> 01:24:53.322
BETWEEN STROKER ACE
AND THE CHECKERED FLAG
IS AUBREY JAMES.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:58.194
IN TWO LAPS,

01:24:58.261 --> 01:25:01.130
ONE OF THEM WILL BE
THE NASCAR CHAMPION.

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.138
I GOT YOU NOW!

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:28.624
DAMN!

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:43.272
IT'S THE WHITE FLAG.
ONE LAP TO GO.
30 SECONDS!

01:25:43.339 --> 01:25:45.541
IT PORTENDS TO BE
A DRAMATIC FINISH.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.249
COME ON, 10!

01:25:58.221 --> 01:26:02.891
THE WHOLE NASCAR SEASON
WILL BE DECIDED
BY A MATTER OF INCHES.

01:26:34.089 --> 01:26:35.291
COME ON!

01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.872
HOW'S THIS FOR SPECTACULAR?

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:51.774
WA-HOO!

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.141
UNBELIEVABLE!

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.411
UPSIDE-DOWN
OVER THE FINISH LINE.

01:26:55.478 --> 01:26:58.314
HEE HEE! WOO!

01:26:58.381 --> 01:26:59.948
HEY, STROKER!
