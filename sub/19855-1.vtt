01:53.413 --> 01:55.447
Used to perform on the west side
of town

01:55.548 --> 01:57.082
over at Bart Reed's
Comic Strip.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.551
[crowd cheering]

01:59.652 --> 02:02.421
I was here on my 21st birthday.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.423
I'll never forget.

02:04.524 --> 02:07.559
Never forget it.

02:07.660 --> 02:10.562
And that's the last time
I drank in El Paso.

02:10.663 --> 02:11.897
Uh-huh.

02:11.998 --> 02:14.199
You guys don't mess around.
It was my birthday.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.034
I'm hanging out at the club,
and they're like,

02:16.136 --> 02:17.102
"It's your birthday."

02:17.203 --> 02:18.604
I'm like, "It's my birthday."

02:18.705 --> 02:21.140
"You want a drink?"
"Sure."

02:21.241 --> 02:23.809
So I started drinking
and drinking and drinking.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.145
And then the staff was like,
"Do you want to party?"

02:26.246 --> 02:29.214
I was like...
[slurring] "I wanna party."

02:29.315 --> 02:31.884
"You want to dance?"
"I wanna dance."

02:31.985 --> 02:35.754
I passed out, and I woke up
at someplace called the O.P.

02:35.855 --> 02:38.857

02:46.299 --> 02:48.200

I'm from L.A.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.043

stood for "Orale Pues".

03:00.079 --> 03:02.381

03:18.898 --> 03:23.802
There was a little guy behind me
going, "Pikachu."

03:23.903 --> 03:26.271
He was like,
"Yo tambien soy Pokemon."

03:26.372 --> 03:28.974
No.
Uh-uh.

03:29.075 --> 03:30.008
But it was kind of crazy.

03:30.109 --> 03:31.877
I was getting checked out
by guys.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.011
I was like, "Oh, my God."

03:33.112 --> 03:34.446
And I know they were
checking me out,

03:34.547 --> 03:40.752
'cause they were looking at me
like I look at tacos.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.054
But then I thought about it.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.324
"Oh, my God,
I just turned on a man.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.426

03:51.731 --> 03:54.333
Man, I called my girlfriend.

03:54.434 --> 03:58.136
I said, "You better not mess up.
I have options."

03:58.238 --> 04:00.706
Uh-huh.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.841
I have memory.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.177
A few years back, I was doing
a show at the Comic Strip,

04:05.278 --> 04:09.081
and my idol, Mr. Paul Rodriguez,
was in town doing a benefit.

04:12.952 --> 04:15.087
He calls up the Comic Strip,
and he says, he says,

04:15.188 --> 04:17.522
"Hey, listen, I'm doing
a benefit up the street.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.091
"Y sabes que, vato?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.625
"I'm gonna come down there,
and I want to do some shots.

04:20.726 --> 04:21.692
Some tequila, some tacos."

04:21.793 --> 04:23.195
I'm like, "Let's do it."

04:23.296 --> 04:24.429
He shows up to the club,
and he says,

04:24.530 --> 04:26.231
"All right, get in the car.
Let's go."

04:26.332 --> 04:28.300
"Where are we going?"
"We're going to Juarez."

04:28.401 --> 04:30.035
"Juarez?
Let's eat some tacos here."

04:30.136 --> 04:33.905
"I can't afford you here.
Let's go to the other side."

04:34.007 --> 04:36.208
[makes engine noise]

04:36.309 --> 04:38.210
So we wind up on the other side,

04:38.311 --> 04:39.645
and we wound up
killing some tacos,

04:39.746 --> 04:41.513
and, you know, we wound up
crossing the border.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.283
And when we crossed the border,
it was a few months after

04:44.384 --> 04:47.019
I taped a bunch
of water commercials here.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.588
You guys remember
the water commercials?

04:49.689 --> 04:51.490
Yeah, and then they pulled me
off the advertising

04:51.591 --> 04:52.924
because they said I was too fat
to sell water.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.426
Whatever.

04:54.527 --> 04:57.195
So we're crossing the border,
and Immigration was right there,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.364
and they're checking the cars,
and we're in a blue van.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.733
My buddy Jim, who's sitting
over there, was driving,

05:01.834 --> 05:03.835
and Border Patrol comes
over to the window,

05:03.936 --> 05:05.170
and he goes---
he opens the door

05:05.271 --> 05:06.672
and he sees me.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.408
He goes, "Oh, my God.
It's you. You're hysterical.

05:09.509 --> 05:10.642
And I go, "What do you think
of this guy?"

05:10.743 --> 05:12.344
And Paul was like,
"Hey, what's up?"

05:12.445 --> 05:13.679
And the guy was like,
"Oh, my God."

05:13.780 --> 05:15.380
So we wound up taking pictures
at the border.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.349
And it was so funny,
'cause we're outside the car,

05:17.450 --> 05:19.418
and we're pretending
to be arrested, right?

05:19.519 --> 05:21.119
People are driving by going,

05:21.220 --> 05:24.156
"Let Paul Rodriguez
and Pikachu go!"

05:24.257 --> 05:27.259
They're American!
Let 'em go!"

05:27.360 --> 05:30.896
[laughing]

05:30.997 --> 05:33.865
It was priceless.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.634
We crossed the border,
and Paul was like,

05:35.735 --> 05:38.236
"I want to go hang out
and have a good time."

05:38.338 --> 05:41.840
He went to this place
off the 1 0 called Jaguars.

05:41.941 --> 05:43.275
[crowd cheers]

05:43.376 --> 05:45.844
It's a "male,"
you know, gentleman's club,

05:45.945 --> 05:47.212
whatever you want to call it.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.014
So we go in there, and I'm like,
"Oh, my God."

05:49.115 --> 05:50.682
As soon as we walked in,
I'm like---

05:50.783 --> 05:52.551
I'm thinking Paul's
gonna be all like,

05:52.652 --> 05:54.252
"Shh, I don't want nobody
to know I'm here."

05:54.354 --> 05:56.054
Goes over to the DJ,
and the DJ's like,

05:56.155 --> 05:58.457
"All right, ladies,
look who just walked in:

05:58.558 --> 06:00.292
Paul Rodriguez!"

06:00.393 --> 06:02.394
All of a sudden, there's,
like, 32 lap dances

06:02.495 --> 06:03.729
that stop like that.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.664
And all these girls,
they bum-rush Paul.

06:05.765 --> 06:09.735
And I'm like, "Wow,
I got to get funnier."

06:12.271 --> 06:14.106
So we're hanging out there
for a couple of hours.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.741
So we wind up outside
in the parking lot,

06:15.842 --> 06:17.843
And this girl jumped
into the car, and she's like,

06:17.944 --> 06:19.044
"Oh, my God, Paul Rodriguez.

06:19.145 --> 06:21.146
"I love you.
My mama's a huge fan too.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.714
Here. Please, please, please."

06:22.815 --> 06:25.117
And he, "Whatever, whatever,
okay, come here, come here."

06:25.218 --> 06:27.719
"Here, please,
talk to her on the phone."

06:27.820 --> 06:29.755
"Ora."

06:29.856 --> 06:31.590
He looks at me
in the front seat,

06:31.691 --> 06:33.191
and he goes, "Hey, tu, Iglesias.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.527
Here, be me."

06:35.628 --> 06:37.763
He put me on the phone
with the girl's mom.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.698
I'm like, "Hey, senora.
How you doing?

06:39.799 --> 06:41.066
"Yeah, you know, uh...

06:41.167 --> 06:42.634
"your daughter,
she's a real angel.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.070

they call her here."

06:45.171 --> 06:47.305
[audience laughing]

06:49.776 --> 06:50.909
Yeah, man, I love Paul.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.377
Like I said, Paul's the...
you know,

06:52.478 --> 06:54.446
one of the main reasons
why I got into comedy.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.715
And he used to mess
with me a lot; trust me.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.350
In my last special,
I talked about

06:58.451 --> 07:00.118
how I had a Volkswagen Beetle.

07:00.219 --> 07:03.221
It was a true story.
I really had a Beetle.

07:03.322 --> 07:06.124
And I got rid of it because
I got tired of the fat jokes.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.393
When you're a fluffy guy
and you have a little car

07:08.494 --> 07:10.829
and all of your friends
are professional comedians...

07:10.930 --> 07:12.264
oh, they'll make you cry.

Paul, especially.

to squeeze inside of that?

"That's what I want to know.

When you fart,
does it go faster?"

07:26.512 --> 07:28.480
One after another after another.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.348
I'm like, "Oh, my God."

07:30.450 --> 07:33.118
And you know what it is?
It's Karma.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.686
'Cause ten years ago,

07:34.787 --> 07:37.689
I did a joke
about Paul Rodriguez on TV.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.191
I used to be on a show

07:39.292 --> 07:41.159
on the Nickelodeon Network
called AII That.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.228
Some of you remember?
Yeah?

07:43.329 --> 07:44.863
That was me, a lot smaller.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.097
I was only two X's.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.300
I was a dos equis.
Yeah.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.536
Anyway, as soon as the TV show
season was over,

07:51.637 --> 07:53.238
they gave all
the cast members gifts.

07:53.339 --> 07:56.174
They gave this one girl a TV,
this one kid a DVD collection.

07:56.275 --> 07:58.810
Since I was the only one
who had his own car,

07:58.911 --> 08:02.447
they gave me a car alarm
with a remote start to it.

08:02.548 --> 08:05.183
A lot of cars have those now,
but think back ten years ago.

08:05.284 --> 08:06.818
There was only a few
that had the...

08:06.919 --> 08:09.955
[imitates alarm beeping,

08:10.056 --> 08:11.756
My friends went,
"Where'd you get that?"

08:11.858 --> 08:15.494
I looked at them, and I said...
"Nickelodeon!"

08:15.595 --> 08:16.628
"That's bad!"

08:16.729 --> 08:18.063
I go to show it off
to everybody.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.131
I show it to my mom, I said,
"Mom, go to the car.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.000
I got to use the bathroom.
I left you a present."

08:22.101 --> 08:23.068
[gasps]
"Un present, okay!"

08:23.169 --> 08:24.302
So she goes to the car,

08:24.403 --> 08:26.338
and I started the car
from the kitchen.

"Mom, it's not the devil.

and I'm working with my idol,
with Paul Rodriguez.

we go---you know,

we're walking out the door,

the whole fluffy thing you do.

"It's catchy. Sounds cute.

We walk outside, and my car
is parked there first

09:11.150 --> 09:12.651
because I showed up late.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.253
So I'm---you know, my car's
right there and Paul walks by.

He walks right in front
of my car.

"Dude, show him your car.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.063
And I couldn't help it,
you know, freakin'...

09:25.164 --> 09:27.265
[imitates alarm beeping,
car engine starting]

09:27.366 --> 09:28.500
"Hey! Hijole!"

09:28.601 --> 09:30.468
What the hell? What is this?"

09:30.570 --> 09:31.670
"Paul!"

09:32.705 --> 09:34.139
"Nickelodeon!"

09:34.240 --> 09:37.509
"Hombre, cabron pinche, Fluffy,
you gave me a heart attack.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.544
You take it easy."

09:39.645 --> 09:42.380
Valet brings his car around,
a brand-new Porsche 91 1.

09:42.481 --> 09:44.149
The car was nice.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.418
You know, it pulls up.
[imitates roaring engine]

09:46.519 --> 09:48.453
Valet gives him the keys.

09:48.554 --> 09:49.955
He turns around and looks at me.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.590
"Hey, tu, Fluffy.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.058
Check it out."

09:53.159 --> 09:55.894
I'm like, "Whatever.
It's not Nickelodeon."

09:55.995 --> 09:57.529
[imitates car alarm beeping]

09:57.630 --> 09:59.631
The door pops open.

"HBO."

10:23.889 --> 10:26.324
[laughing and cheering]

10:34.266 --> 10:36.034
A lot has changed, El Paso.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.435
A lot has changed.

10:37.536 --> 10:40.739
One thing's for sure;
I'm still the fluffy guy.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.941
[cheering]

10:46.045 --> 10:49.514
And I say "fluffy" 'cause that
is the politically correct term.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.216
For those of you
that don't remember,

10:51.317 --> 10:55.587
I used to say that there
were five levels of fatness.

10:55.688 --> 11:00.925
Reason why I say "used to say"
is because now there are six.

11:01.027 --> 11:05.063
Uh-huh. I met the new one
in Las Cruces.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.500
The original five levels
are big, healthy,

11:08.601 --> 11:11.703
husky, fluffy and damn!

11:11.804 --> 11:14.706
People ask, "What could
be bigger than damn?"

11:14.807 --> 11:15.940
The new level's called,

11:16.042 --> 11:17.942
"Oh, hell, no!"

11:18.044 --> 11:20.045
[laughter, applause]

11:25.751 --> 11:27.052
What's the difference?

11:27.153 --> 11:30.055
You're still willing to work
with level five.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.690
Example: If you're
on an elevator

11:31.791 --> 11:34.125
and you're with your friend,
and this really big guy gets on

11:34.226 --> 11:35.827
and you and your friend look
at each other,

11:35.928 --> 11:37.896
and you're like, "Damn!"

11:37.997 --> 11:41.533
But you still let the big guy
ride your elevator.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.168
That's the difference.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.237
Level six, you see walking
towards your elevator.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.339
[deep grunting]

11:50.543 --> 11:53.344
"Oh, hell, no!"

11:53.446 --> 11:54.345
[rumbling]

11:54.447 --> 11:55.346
"No!"

11:55.448 --> 11:56.748
[rumbling]

11:56.849 --> 11:57.916
"No!

11:58.017 --> 11:59.017
No!"

12:00.052 --> 12:02.687
That's the difference.

12:02.788 --> 12:06.324
The guy that I met
was 6"8', 614 pounds.

12:06.425 --> 12:10.028
[audience gasping]
Uh-huh, "Aw, hell, no."

12:10.129 --> 12:12.263
And he was offended at my show,

12:12.364 --> 12:14.532
not by anything that I said
but because of the fact

12:14.633 --> 12:17.736
that now, at the shows,
I started selling T-shirts,

12:17.837 --> 12:22.307
and, apparently,
I didn't have his size.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.877
Keep in mind, I go all the way
up to 5X on the T-shirts,

12:25.978 --> 12:27.212
and he was like...

12:27.313 --> 12:29.681
[in deep, raspy voice]
"You don't have my size."

12:29.782 --> 12:31.783
I was like, "Dude,
I didn't know they made you."

12:31.884 --> 12:32.884
[laughter]

12:36.355 --> 12:40.759
I have up to 5X,
I don't have [growls] "X"

12:40.860 --> 12:42.861
with a picture of a dinosaur
on the back of the tag,

12:42.962 --> 12:45.530
you know.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.532
No.

12:47.633 --> 12:50.201
And by the way, you guys,
I want to let you know now

12:50.302 --> 12:52.537
here in this theater
and all over the world,

12:52.638 --> 12:55.039
wherever anybody's watching
this special,

12:55.141 --> 12:59.410
if you ever see me in public,

12:59.512 --> 13:03.281
either at a restaurant
or at a hotel or anywhere,

13:03.382 --> 13:05.216
and you want to stop me
and say hello

13:05.317 --> 13:07.418
or take a picture or anything,
please.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.188
I welcome it and it's an honor
if you were to do that.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.590
I do not mind at all.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.425
[cheering and applause]

13:14.527 --> 13:17.195
Stop me anytime you want.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.765
I'm the same person.

13:22.768 --> 13:25.737
The same guy.

13:26.739 --> 13:30.141
Thank you.
Seriously,

13:30.242 --> 13:32.410
the same guy you see now is
the same guy you'd see outside.

13:32.511 --> 13:34.012
I don't change, you know.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.381
You're not gonna walk up and go,
"Gabriel, can I talk to you?"

13:36.482 --> 13:39.017
I'm not going to be like,
"Be gone from me.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.486
"Gabriel is my stage name.

13:41.587 --> 13:44.455
I'm not even Mexican;
I'm Scandinavian."

13:44.557 --> 13:47.492
No, trust me, I'm the same
pendejo you'll see outside.

13:47.593 --> 13:48.493
I don't mind.

13:48.594 --> 13:49.761
I love it, you guys, trust me.

13:49.862 --> 13:50.762
You guys make it possible

13:50.863 --> 13:52.363
for me to have
an incredible life

13:52.464 --> 13:54.899
and take care of my family,
so I'm all for it.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.100
Not a problem.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.101
Trust me,

13:57.203 --> 13:58.636
right now it's so crazy

13:58.737 --> 14:01.139
'cause I'm still adjusting
to people walking up to me.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.107
I'm checking into the hotel,

14:03.209 --> 14:04.776
and they already knew me,
which was crazy.

14:04.877 --> 14:06.110
I go like,
"Uh, hi, I'm checking in."

14:06.212 --> 14:07.111
"Here's your key, sir."

14:07.213 --> 14:09.113
"But, um, um..."

14:09.215 --> 14:10.815
"We know it's you, sir."

14:10.916 --> 14:11.816
I'm like, "Ah!"

14:11.917 --> 14:13.918
[laughs]

14:14.954 --> 14:17.355
You know,
I think that's awesome.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.891
I needed that,
like, six years ago.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.227
One time, I was trying
to check into a hotel

14:22.328 --> 14:24.796
in Chicago
at 1:00 in the morning

14:24.897 --> 14:26.497
because I missed my flight.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.500
Nobody's at the front desk,
just the little bell

14:29.602 --> 14:32.203
and a sign that said
"Ring for service."

14:32.304 --> 14:33.304
So there I am.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.406
Ching.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.709
Ching, ching.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.143
Ching.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.346
Ching, ching, ching, ching,
ching, ching, ching.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.815
Ching, ching.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.284
Ching, ching,
ching, ching, ching.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.319
All of a sudden, I heard this.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.288
"I hear the bell."

14:54.760 --> 14:57.061
All of a sudden,
this lady came out.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.734
[exhales]

15:02.835 --> 15:06.070
"Are you the one ringing
that damn bell?

15:06.171 --> 15:07.372
What the hell you want?"

15:07.473 --> 15:08.773
"Um, I'm checking in."

15:08.874 --> 15:12.777
"You know what time it is?
It's tomorrow."

15:12.878 --> 15:14.045
"I know, I missed my flight."

15:14.146 --> 15:16.047
"Mm-hmm, whatever you say."

15:16.148 --> 15:17.081
[exhales]

15:17.182 --> 15:18.182
"What's going on out there?"

15:18.284 --> 15:19.417
"Girl, you got to see this.

15:19.518 --> 15:23.054
"I got a big-ass Mexican
showing up late as hell.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.524
Okay."

15:26.625 --> 15:27.525
[imitates typing]

15:27.626 --> 15:30.161
"What's your name?"

15:30.262 --> 15:32.063
"My name is Gabriel Iglesias."

15:32.164 --> 15:33.197
'"E'-glesias?"

15:33.299 --> 15:34.432
"Yes, Iglesias."

15:34.533 --> 15:37.602
"Okay, 'E'-glesias,
okay, E-G-L-I..."

15:37.703 --> 15:40.672
"No, no, no, no,
it's Iglesias with an 'I."'

15:40.773 --> 15:42.006
"With an 'I'?

15:42.107 --> 15:44.575
"But you said 'E'...glesias.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.910
"You didn't say 'I'-glesias.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.212
You said 'E'...glesias."

15:48.314 --> 15:49.747
"It's Iglesias with an 'I."'

15:49.848 --> 15:51.983
"Mm-hmm, whatever you say.
It's your damn name.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.184
"Okay?

15:53.285 --> 15:55.720
Mr. Iglesias with an 'I."'

15:55.821 --> 15:56.754
[exhales]

15:56.855 --> 15:57.956
"You know, that's bad for you."

15:58.057 --> 15:59.090
"Oh, this right here?

15:59.191 --> 16:00.892
My grandmamma lived to be
1 00 years old."

16:00.993 --> 16:02.026
"Smoking?"

16:02.127 --> 16:04.395
"Minding her own damn business.
Okay?

16:04.496 --> 16:06.864
"Mr. Iglesias with an 'I.'

16:06.966 --> 16:09.634
"Okay, I found you
in the system.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.136
I got you for two nights,
full-size bed, non-smoking."

16:12.237 --> 16:14.372
"I requested a queen-size bed."

16:14.473 --> 16:15.807
"And you would have got a queen

16:15.908 --> 16:17.608
"if you'd have been here
yesterday,

16:17.710 --> 16:20.912
"but it's tomorrow and you're
lucky I'm talking to you,

16:21.013 --> 16:23.581
"Mr. Iglesias with an 'I.'

16:23.682 --> 16:26.617
What's the 'I' stand for---
'I need a bigger bed'?"

16:27.920 --> 16:29.821
"What's going on out there?"

16:29.922 --> 16:31.089
"Girl, you got to see this.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.092
Nacho Libre is trippin'."

16:37.062 --> 16:38.563
"Whatever.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.765
Give me a hard time."

16:40.866 --> 16:42.233
A lot has changed, though, man.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.702
For those of you that don't know
by now, I finally became a dad.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.939
[cheering and applause]
Yeah.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.174
Thank you.

16:50.275 --> 16:51.943
Hell, yeah.

16:52.044 --> 16:54.112
He's ten.
[laughing]

16:54.213 --> 16:56.080
Surprised me too.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.016
Yeah, they found me.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.250
And it's not what you think.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.252
I didn't discover
that I had a lost child.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.554
It's just that I hooked up
with a beautiful woman

17:03.655 --> 17:06.156
who had a pre-started family,

17:06.258 --> 17:07.825
so basically I became
a stepfather.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.627
You know, I just took over
the payments.

17:10.729 --> 17:15.032
Best part for me is that my
new son looks exactly like me.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.534
He's fluffy too.

17:16.635 --> 17:17.602
[cheering and applause]

17:17.703 --> 17:21.071
Ten years old, 1 62 pounds.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.973
Yeah, he's a little---
damn.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.242
[laughter]

17:24.343 --> 17:25.376
And he's the cutest kid.

17:25.477 --> 17:26.944
You talk to him---
his name is Frankie---

17:27.046 --> 17:28.646
like, "Frankie,
what do you like to do?"

17:28.747 --> 17:32.617
"I like microwave burritos
and PlayStation."

17:32.718 --> 17:34.552
"Me too."

17:34.653 --> 17:38.256
Only problem is he wakes up
early, 5:00 every morning.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.290
[knocking]

17:39.391 --> 17:40.958
[in squeaky voice]
"Gabriel."

17:41.060 --> 17:42.360
"What?"

17:42.461 --> 17:43.961
"I'm hungry."

17:44.063 --> 17:46.864
"Me too.
Make something."

17:46.965 --> 17:48.466
And he does.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.401
I can hear him in the kitchen
making Hot Pockets,

17:50.502 --> 17:53.438
you know, freaking---
[beeping]

17:53.539 --> 17:55.740
[whirring]

17:55.841 --> 17:57.075
[beeps]

17:57.176 --> 17:58.743
And he opens the door
and doesn't close it,

17:58.844 --> 18:00.745
and the whole house freaking---
[sniffs]

18:00.846 --> 18:03.081
[moans, laughs]

18:03.182 --> 18:04.282
 ♪ Hot Pocket  ♪

18:04.383 --> 18:06.751
Delicious, oh.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.154
Oh, my God,

18:10.255 --> 18:12.990
and he's so cute because right
now he's going through puberty,

18:13.092 --> 18:15.026
and I think it's hysterical.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.194
His mom doesn't think so.

18:16.295 --> 18:18.429
She's like, "No."
I go, "Yeah,

18:18.530 --> 18:19.664
I caught him
checking out a girl."

18:19.765 --> 18:20.665
"How do you know?"

18:20.766 --> 18:22.567
"I was looking at her too."

18:22.668 --> 18:25.336
She was hot!

18:25.437 --> 18:27.338
And I told my girl, I said,
"Baby, don't worry.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.207
"If he has any questions,
I'll be the man.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.775
I'll take care of it."

18:30.876 --> 18:32.944
'Cause I went through puberty
at ten.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.178
And she's like, "Oh, thank you."

18:34.279 --> 18:35.713
I said, "Don't worry,
I took care of it.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.682
"You know, hey,
I went through puberty at ten.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.375

19:48.921 --> 19:50.454
I know it's happening
at my house now

19:50.556 --> 19:52.190

"I wonder what he's watching,"

20:02.568 --> 20:04.168

through my channels,

20:04.269 --> 20:07.171

that would "spark interest."

20:07.272 --> 20:10.041

he's watching Cinemax.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.410

that's what he's watching.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.882
I know
that's what he's watching

20:17.983 --> 20:20.585
because out of my TV,
I'm getting direct sound,

20:20.686 --> 20:22.019
and then I'm getting, like,

20:22.120 --> 20:23.988
a little delayed echo
down the hall.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.023

21:25.817 --> 21:27.351
or do you do that
in public too?"

21:27.452 --> 21:29.120

Look at some of you---
"IHOP? "

22:12.197 --> 22:13.698
Yeah, let me explain this one.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.800
Next time you go to an IHOP,
look for the podium.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.201
Usually on the weekends,

22:17.302 --> 22:19.337
they'll have the podium set up
right at the front door,

22:19.438 --> 22:21.939
and when you walk in, they'll
have a host and they'll ask you,

22:22.040 --> 22:23.274
"How many in your party?"

22:23.375 --> 22:25.409
And you tell them two, three,
four, whatever the case,

22:25.510 --> 22:26.944
and then when it's time
for your seats,

22:27.045 --> 22:28.546
they'll call you
with the little freaking---

22:28.647 --> 22:29.680
you know,
they got the microphone

22:29.781 --> 22:31.482
on the side of the wall,
and they'll go,

22:31.583 --> 22:35.519
"Paging party of four, paging
party of four, now serving."

22:35.620 --> 22:38.222
When that party walked away,
I grabbed her microphone

22:38.323 --> 22:41.125
and I said,
"Paging Mexican party of 47,

22:41.226 --> 22:44.595
Mexican party of 47,
now serving."

22:44.696 --> 22:47.665

was like...

22:51.970 --> 22:54.772
" Orale guey!"

22:54.873 --> 22:55.940
Hell, yeah.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.976
I love IHOP.
I go too much, you guys.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.645
I was at an IHOP one time
during an earthquake.

23:01.747 --> 23:03.013
Wasn't a big one.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.082
It was enough to feel it,
but not freak out, you know.

23:05.183 --> 23:06.684
I live in California,
so we get 'em a lot.

23:06.785 --> 23:08.452

you're all...

23:10.088 --> 23:13.557

23:43.588 --> 23:45.089
You know, and then
whenever they happen,

23:45.190 --> 23:46.657
you never believe
it's an earthquake.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.926

an earthquake or a big truck?"

27:22.607 --> 27:24.541
No.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.211
Anyways, that's as far
as I'll go with that.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.046
"He said he wasn't gonna
get political."

27:29.147 --> 27:30.147
Yeah, I know.

27:30.248 --> 27:31.382
Gotta change that up, you guys.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.217
A lot of things are changing.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.251
A lot.

27:34.352 --> 27:35.419
Got the relationship now.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.087
It's going good.
I love my girlfriend.

27:37.188 --> 27:38.522
She's here in the house
tonight too.

27:38.623 --> 27:40.557
[cheering, applause]

27:40.659 --> 27:43.560
It's awesome.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.563
We rarely fight.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.298
And I think that's
so freaking cool.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.466
And I know why.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.135
It's because I do this
for a living.

27:51.236 --> 27:53.137
Uh-huh, and she knows

27:53.238 --> 27:56.140
whatever we argue about will
eventually end up right here.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.408
[laughter]

27:57.509 --> 27:59.276
It slows her down.
You ought to see her.

27:59.377 --> 28:00.711
"You know what I think?"

28:00.812 --> 28:02.813
"Go ahead, say it, say it."

28:05.483 --> 28:07.384
Uh-huh.

28:07.485 --> 28:08.852
Yeah.

28:08.953 --> 28:10.320
The only problem I have
with my girl sometimes

28:10.422 --> 28:11.855
are her friends.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.524
I don't like her friends,
'cause they're haters.

28:13.625 --> 28:14.858
[scattered cheering]
They are.

28:14.959 --> 28:15.859
Look, the guy's clapping.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.361
Yeah, I know, man.

28:17.462 --> 28:19.029
It sucks.
Every time I leave the house,

28:19.130 --> 28:20.531
and I go out of town
for the weekend,

28:20.632 --> 28:22.366
they show up, and they start
throwing little monkey wrenches

28:22.467 --> 28:23.734
in there, you know.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.903
[in female voice]
"So he's not here?

28:26.004 --> 28:27.905
"Where is he?
How come you're not with him?

28:28.006 --> 28:29.173
"What's the story?
What's the deal?

28:29.274 --> 28:30.474
"How long have you
been together now?

28:30.575 --> 28:31.742
"You're not engaged?
You're not married?

28:31.843 --> 28:33.010
"What's up?
Is he gonna adopt Frankie?

28:33.111 --> 28:34.044
"What's the word?
What's going on?

28:34.145 --> 28:35.245
"How come you don't have a ring?

28:35.346 --> 28:36.880
"Norma has a ring
and she's a puta.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.315
How come you don't have a ring?"

28:38.416 --> 28:40.718
[laughter, applause]

28:44.989 --> 28:46.890
So I'll get these
messed-up phone calls

28:46.991 --> 28:49.059
at, like, 2:00 in the morning
when I'm the road, right.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.227
[mimics phone ringing]

28:50.328 --> 28:51.261
"Hello."

28:51.362 --> 28:52.763
[mimics crying]

28:52.864 --> 28:54.098
"Baby?"
"Yeah?"

28:54.199 --> 28:55.766
"Are you okay?"
"Mm-hmm."

28:55.867 --> 28:57.267
"What are you doing?"
"Nothing.

28:57.368 --> 28:59.269
"I'm just here at the house,

28:59.370 --> 29:01.371
watching Cheaters. "

29:02.941 --> 29:04.842
"Great."

29:04.943 --> 29:06.343
Oh, wow, did you see that?

29:06.444 --> 29:07.377
I almost fell.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.179
Ooh!

29:09.280 --> 29:10.814
If I fall now, show's over.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.716
[mumbling]
Oh, my God.

29:12.817 --> 29:14.218
Yeah, there'll be people
outside.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.720
"We're standing here live
in front of the Plaza Theatre.

29:16.821 --> 29:19.556
"Where authorities believe
Fluffy lost control.

29:19.657 --> 29:21.391
"Seven people were
reported injured,

29:21.493 --> 29:22.626
"three were rushed
to the hospital.

29:22.727 --> 29:24.161
"Authorities had this to say,

29:24.262 --> 29:25.262
'Damn!"'

29:28.399 --> 29:30.400
[cheering, applause, whistling]

29:34.506 --> 29:36.507
Whoo!

29:37.909 --> 29:39.276
Thank you.

29:39.377 --> 29:41.111
They'd be interviewing people.
"Ma'am, what happened?"

29:41.212 --> 29:42.946
"It got dark."

29:43.047 --> 29:44.114
"Sir, what did you see?"

29:44.215 --> 29:46.116
[mimics roaring, thud]

29:46.217 --> 29:48.085
"Se cayo Pikachu."
Yeah, l know.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.653
"He fell."

29:49.754 --> 29:51.021
Uh-huh.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.857
But, no, anyways, let me finish
to tell you what happened.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.859
So my girl started tripping out,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.528
and I start getting
these weird phone calls.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.695
Finally, I got tired of it.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.030
I said, "You know what?
I don't need this.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.365
"You know, I don't need it.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.300
"From now on when I take off
on the road,

30:03.401 --> 30:05.135
no more phone calls."

30:05.236 --> 30:06.970
- Yeah!
- Look at that guy. "Yeah!"

30:07.071 --> 30:08.305
Are you here by yourself?

30:08.406 --> 30:10.340
[laughter]

30:10.441 --> 30:11.508
Uh-huh.

30:11.609 --> 30:12.743
Whatever, dude.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.712
[applause, cheering]
Anyway...

30:15.814 --> 30:17.981
Here's the thing: I took my girl
to the Apple store.

30:18.082 --> 30:19.249
And I got her an iPhone.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.918
I got myself one
and I said, "From now on,

30:21.019 --> 30:22.753
we're texting each other."

30:22.854 --> 30:24.822
And believe it or not,
she was cool with that,

30:24.923 --> 30:26.990
because anytime she would
send me a text,

30:27.091 --> 30:28.992
I would reply like that.

30:29.093 --> 30:30.160
I could be anywhere.

30:30.261 --> 30:31.495
Freaking in the bathroom.
Freaking...

30:31.596 --> 30:32.996
[mimics ding]

30:33.097 --> 30:34.998
"What are you doing?"

30:35.099 --> 30:36.834
[laughs]

30:36.935 --> 30:38.836
"I'm blowing it up!

30:38.937 --> 30:40.504
I love you." Send.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.172
And she'd reply,
"Oh, my God, me too.

30:42.273 --> 30:44.007
I love you!"

30:44.108 --> 30:47.010
It sounds so stupid, but it was
working out perfectly

30:47.111 --> 30:49.012
until one night I got drunk.

30:49.113 --> 30:50.681
[audience oohs]

30:50.782 --> 30:52.216
Oh, you want to hear this?

30:52.317 --> 30:54.051
all: Yeah!
- You want to hear this?

30:54.152 --> 30:55.219
all: Yeah!

30:55.320 --> 30:56.653
- So check this out.

30:56.754 --> 30:59.656
I'm leaving a comedy club
in San Jose, California.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.592
And I'm walking back
to my hotel room,

31:01.693 --> 31:03.460
which is one block away.

31:03.561 --> 31:04.895
As I'm walking, I pass in front

31:04.996 --> 31:07.898
of this bar on the corner
called Cinebar.

31:07.999 --> 31:10.400
It's got all kinds of cinema
and movie memorabilia in there.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.436
Looks cool;
I'm walking in front,

31:12.537 --> 31:15.439
and there are people in that bar
that just left my show.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.642
So I walk in front,
and I heard, "Fluffy!

31:18.743 --> 31:20.677
Hey, let me buy you a shot!"

31:20.778 --> 31:23.714
I was like, "Well, you know,
I don't want to be rude."

31:23.815 --> 31:24.948
[laughter]

31:25.049 --> 31:27.417
Can't have that, right?
So I walked in.

31:27.518 --> 31:29.186
I said, "What's---you know,
I'm on way back to my room.

31:29.287 --> 31:30.554
I'll just do
a couple shots, whatever."

31:30.655 --> 31:32.256
So you know, one shot
and then somebody, "Me too."

31:32.357 --> 31:34.291
"All right, me too.
Vamonos. Let's do it."

31:34.392 --> 31:36.126
"Me three." "Me four."

31:36.227 --> 31:38.795
1 5 shots of tequila later...

31:38.897 --> 31:40.797
[audience oohs]

31:40.899 --> 31:42.799
[whistling, cheering]

31:42.901 --> 31:44.635
It occurs to me,

31:44.736 --> 31:46.403
"I think I should go."

31:46.504 --> 31:49.072
I start walking
towards the door.

31:49.173 --> 31:51.642
I took three steps,
the cold air hit me.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.977
I got dizzy and I fell.
Hard.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.279
I know I fell hard,

31:55.380 --> 31:57.314
'cause when I hit the ground
I farted.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.482
[laughter]

31:58.583 --> 32:00.484
[mimics fart]

32:00.585 --> 32:02.920
"Oh, my God, I farted!"

32:03.021 --> 32:04.321
My buddy Martin ran over,

32:04.422 --> 32:05.756
and he helped me
up off the ground.

32:05.857 --> 32:06.790
"You okay, Gabriel?"

32:06.891 --> 32:08.191
[mumbling]

32:08.293 --> 32:09.693
We stumbled back
to the hotel room,

32:09.794 --> 32:11.361
I sit down in the lobby,
and I'm just like...

32:11.462 --> 32:12.896
[exhaling]

32:12.997 --> 32:14.164
"Are you okay, Gabriel?"

32:14.265 --> 32:15.565
"I'm okay, man.
Where's my phone?

32:15.667 --> 32:17.567
I gotta let my girl know
I'm okay."

32:17.669 --> 32:18.735
"You're holding it."

32:18.836 --> 32:20.637
"Oh, thank you, Martin.
I love you.

32:20.738 --> 32:22.306
"I love you.
You're a good friend, man.

32:22.407 --> 32:23.640
You're a good friend."

32:23.741 --> 32:25.542
He goes, "What are you doing?"
"I'm gonna text."

32:25.643 --> 32:27.544
"Dude, just call her."
"No!

32:27.645 --> 32:30.547
"If I call her, she's gonna know
something's up.

32:30.648 --> 32:32.549
"I'm gonna text her.
Watch.

32:32.650 --> 32:35.886
"Baby, I made it back
to the hotel.

32:35.987 --> 32:38.488
"I love you.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.490
Kissy-face."

32:40.591 --> 32:42.092
Send.

32:42.193 --> 32:43.593
[mimics ding]

32:43.695 --> 32:45.562
"How did it go?"

32:45.663 --> 32:47.597
[laughing]
"I farted!

32:47.699 --> 32:49.933
"I shouldn't tell her that,
huh, Martin?

32:50.034 --> 32:50.934
"Okay.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.269
It went good."

32:52.370 --> 32:53.971
[mimics ding]
Send.

32:54.072 --> 32:57.474
"What did you do
after your show?"

32:57.575 --> 33:00.477
"Oh, here we go."

33:00.578 --> 33:02.145
My buddy Martin is like,

33:02.246 --> 33:03.814
"Gabriel, man, Gabriel,
don't tell her---

33:03.915 --> 33:05.649
"don't tell her you were
at a bar getting drunk, man.

33:05.750 --> 33:06.783
Don't tell her."

33:06.884 --> 33:09.786
"Martin, I have to tell her
the truth, bro.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.455
"We're cool like that, man.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.123
"I can talk to her.

33:13.224 --> 33:15.459
"I can---I could tell her
anything, man.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.628
"She's not like your old lady,
you know.

33:18.730 --> 33:19.997
Trippin' all the time."

33:20.098 --> 33:22.265
"Hey, Martin, take the pictures
of the cochina

33:22.367 --> 33:23.367
off the internet."

33:23.468 --> 33:24.868
"Whatever."

33:24.969 --> 33:26.069
"Oh, I'm sorry,
did I say that out loud?

33:26.170 --> 33:27.571
Forgive me, bro."

33:27.672 --> 33:28.572
"Gabriel, lie."

33:28.673 --> 33:29.673
"I can't lie, man."

33:29.774 --> 33:31.341
"Lie!"
"I can't lie!"

33:31.442 --> 33:32.542
"Are you that honest?"

33:32.643 --> 33:35.212
"No, I just won't remember
the lie.

33:35.313 --> 33:37.514
"Why get in trouble two times
for the same stupid thing?

33:37.615 --> 33:38.815
You know what I'm saying, bro?"

33:38.916 --> 33:40.450
So I sent the message.

33:40.551 --> 33:43.186
"Baby, I made it...

33:43.287 --> 33:45.622
Oh, delete, delete, delete."

33:45.723 --> 33:46.823
[chuckles]

33:46.924 --> 33:50.027
"Baby, I went next door

33:50.128 --> 33:54.398
"with Martin to Cinebar.

33:54.499 --> 33:56.233
"Had a nice time.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.835
"Kissy face, kissy face.

33:58.936 --> 34:01.405
"Kissy face.

34:01.506 --> 34:02.639
Send."

34:02.740 --> 34:03.974
[imitates cell phone chiming]

34:04.075 --> 34:05.275
"Lucky you.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.711
"Wish I could've been there
with you.

34:07.812 --> 34:09.746
"Tell Martin I said hi.

34:09.847 --> 34:11.047
I love you."

34:11.149 --> 34:13.617
[laughing]
Oh, my God.

34:13.717 --> 34:16.520
Martin, I just told
my girlfriend

34:16.621 --> 34:19.989
I was at a bar with you,
and she didn't get mad.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.927
What the hell is she doing?

34:24.027 --> 34:26.129
[laughter, applause]

34:34.172 --> 34:37.274
Man, she told me
to tell you hi.

34:37.375 --> 34:40.143
And she don't even like you.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.712
So I scroll back
to read what she read,

34:42.813 --> 34:44.313
and apparently, my stupid iPhone

34:44.415 --> 34:46.116
has this memory
spell check feature,

34:46.217 --> 34:49.418
and it didn't recognize
the word, "Cinebar."

34:49.520 --> 34:52.688
It flipped it and turned it
into Cinnabon.

34:52.790 --> 34:55.992
So apparently, at 1 0:00
at night, my girlfriend thought

34:56.094 --> 34:59.262
I was having cinnamon rolls
with my friend, Martin,

34:59.363 --> 35:01.932
which normally,
would sound like an ugly lie,

35:02.033 --> 35:03.667
but considering her boyfriend
is known

35:03.768 --> 35:05.702
as "the fluffy guy"
who loves "chocolate cake,"

35:05.803 --> 35:07.137
it sounds real.

35:07.238 --> 35:09.172
I was like, "Oh, my God.

35:09.273 --> 35:10.841
"Martin, check it out!

35:10.942 --> 35:12.909
My iPhone lied for me."

35:13.010 --> 35:15.011
[laughter, applause]

35:16.914 --> 35:18.448
I love you, iPhone!

35:20.251 --> 35:21.852
BlackBerry can't do that.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.221
[cackling]

35:24.322 --> 35:27.023
A month later, my girlfriend
heard me tell the story,

35:27.125 --> 35:28.558
and she's like,
"That's a funny joke."

35:28.659 --> 35:29.926
I go, "It really happened."

35:30.027 --> 35:31.228
"How come you didn't tell me?"

35:31.329 --> 35:34.064
I said,
"The phone didn't let me."

35:34.165 --> 35:35.532
And her friends are right there.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.100
"See, he's out there
getting wasted,

35:37.201 --> 35:38.435
sending you messed-up texts."

35:38.536 --> 35:40.637
"Whatever. Shut up, haters."

35:42.173 --> 35:44.407
Yeah, a lot of things
are going on.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.510
Um, in the house here tonight,
you guys,

35:46.611 --> 35:48.245
I'm very happy she was able
to make it.

35:48.346 --> 35:49.379
A lot has been going on.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.815
My mom once again
here at my special...

35:51.916 --> 35:53.049
is in here.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.618
[audience cheering]

35:54.719 --> 35:56.286
Where you at, Ma?

35:56.387 --> 35:57.854
I know you're out here.

35:57.955 --> 35:59.289
Oh, there she is.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.391
[audience cheering]

36:02.927 --> 36:04.628
Andale.

36:06.297 --> 36:10.000
She almost didn't make it here
tonight, you guys, almost.

36:10.101 --> 36:13.737
Uh, a month ago, my mom
got admitted to the hospital.

36:13.838 --> 36:14.871
She got a little sick.

36:14.972 --> 36:17.207
Somebody forgot to take
their medication, uh-uh.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.843
"I don't need it pa'que...
pa'que neces...ay, ay."

36:19.944 --> 36:21.044
Yeah, uh-uh, remember that?

36:21.145 --> 36:22.045
Remember that? Right?
Anyway, Mom...

36:22.146 --> 36:23.446
Sorry, I have to throw it at her

36:23.548 --> 36:24.781
so she makes sure
she takes her medicine.

36:24.882 --> 36:26.483
Got to give my little shout-outs
right now.

36:26.584 --> 36:28.485
Right here in the front row,
you guys...

36:28.586 --> 36:30.554
if anybody saw my last DVD,
in the bonus features,

36:30.655 --> 36:31.588
this gentleman right here,

36:31.689 --> 36:33.323
Freddy Franco---
Fred Franco---

36:33.424 --> 36:37.494
has attended over 250
of my shows.

36:37.595 --> 36:41.331
Over 250 of my shows.

36:41.432 --> 36:44.601
In about five
or six different states.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.537
At first,
my girlfriend was like,

36:47.638 --> 36:48.872
"Psycho."

36:48.973 --> 36:51.041
But he's not---
he's cool.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.175
We've hung out with him.

36:52.276 --> 36:54.010
Just a---one of the greatest
fans ever,

36:54.111 --> 36:56.479
and so I have to give him
his props, you know.

36:56.581 --> 36:59.349
He, uh, took some time
off of work to come out here.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.751
So thank you, Freddy.

37:01.852 --> 37:02.886
Man.

37:02.987 --> 37:04.087
Cabron, you're die-hard.

37:04.188 --> 37:05.655
Please don't ever
turn psycho, please.

37:05.756 --> 37:07.691
'Cause I have some psychos
out there.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.526
They'll show up, and they'll
hang out by the car.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.428
"Gabriel."
[laughing nuttily]

37:15.366 --> 37:17.734
It's funny because this is my---
this is my third special.

37:17.835 --> 37:19.336
In the last special that I did,

37:19.437 --> 37:22.672
I did a bunch of references
to police officers.

37:22.773 --> 37:25.942
And they weren't exactly
flattering references or jokes.

37:26.043 --> 37:27.911
You know, I was just
kind of like saying,

37:28.012 --> 37:30.847
you know, the whole doughnut
thing and, um...[laughs]

37:30.948 --> 37:34.884
Apparently, they became fans
in some weird way,

37:34.986 --> 37:38.588
because I started getting phone
calls to do police functions.

37:38.689 --> 37:40.924
In December,
I had five Christmas parties.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.659
I got a phone call
from my agent.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.628
He's like, "Gabe, check it out.

37:44.729 --> 37:46.529
"CHP, California
Highway Patrol,

37:46.631 --> 37:48.265
wants to hire you to do a show."

37:48.366 --> 37:49.733
I go, "Really?
What does it pay?"

37:49.834 --> 37:51.901
"They want you
to donate your time."

37:52.003 --> 37:54.638
"I think I'm busy."

37:54.739 --> 37:57.240
"They told me to let you know
you have a warrant

37:57.341 --> 37:59.242
in the city
of Fresno, California."

37:59.343 --> 38:02.112
I'm like, "Oh, they're good."

38:03.514 --> 38:04.781
So I did the show.

38:04.882 --> 38:06.416
And I'm gonna tell
you guys right now---

38:06.517 --> 38:07.917
I'm gonna tell you guys
right now,

38:08.019 --> 38:10.153
it was one of the scariest shows
I ever did.

38:10.254 --> 38:12.656
A room full of nothing but cops.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.424
Everybody's drinking a lot.

38:14.525 --> 38:19.229
And I'm scared, because if they
get ghetto, who do I call?

38:19.330 --> 38:21.531
You know, I got to go out
in the parking lot

38:21.632 --> 38:22.666
and find some gang member.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.735
"Hey, back me up!"

38:25.836 --> 38:27.103
So the show went good.

38:27.204 --> 38:29.706
It went so good that they
asked me to do another show

38:29.807 --> 38:31.374
in California, in San Diego,

38:31.475 --> 38:34.344
for the California
Highway Patrol Border Division.

38:34.445 --> 38:35.979
And I tried to make up an excuse

38:36.080 --> 38:37.314
that my car
wasn't working right.

38:37.415 --> 38:39.649
They said, "No worries.
We understand."

38:39.750 --> 38:42.919
They sent a patrol car
to my house

38:43.020 --> 38:45.088
with a freaking
uniformed officer.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.957
And I was like, "Oh, my God."

38:48.059 --> 38:52.829
Best part was I didn't tell
my family he was coming.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.364
Oh, yeah, sometimes
you have to create

38:54.465 --> 38:56.299
your own entertainment.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.467
It was hysterical.

38:57.568 --> 38:58.668
5:00 rolled around.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.303
I'm like, "He should be here
any minute."

39:00.404 --> 39:02.272
Sure enough...
[imitates doorbell ringing]

39:02.373 --> 39:03.773
"Frankie!

39:03.874 --> 39:05.442
Frankie, can you
get the door, please?"

39:05.543 --> 39:07.210
"Okay, Gabriel."
So he goes to the door.

39:07.311 --> 39:09.379
Comes back, and he's got,
like---you know, he's like...

39:09.480 --> 39:11.147
[whispering]
"Gabriel.

39:11.248 --> 39:14.017
Gabriel, the police are here."

39:14.118 --> 39:15.719
"Why are you whispering?"

39:15.820 --> 39:18.221
'"Cause something's
gonna happen."

39:18.322 --> 39:19.889
When he said that, I'm like,

39:19.990 --> 39:22.692
"Oh, I got to freaking
let him have it now, right?"

39:22.793 --> 39:24.894
I said, "Oh, my God, Frankie,
they found me."

39:24.995 --> 39:26.496
"What do you mean, Gabriel?"

39:26.597 --> 39:28.431
"I got to go, Frankie.
I got to go.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.066
"Take care of your mom
for me, okay?

39:30.167 --> 39:31.334
I love you. I love you."

39:31.435 --> 39:32.502
"No!"

39:32.603 --> 39:33.903
"I got to go, Frankie."

39:34.004 --> 39:35.405
And I saw the officer---
I said,

39:35.506 --> 39:37.674
"Pretend you're arresting me.
I want to freak out my kid."

39:37.775 --> 39:40.110
"No problem. Turn around and put
your hands behind your back."

39:40.211 --> 39:42.412
"I can't reach.

39:42.513 --> 39:43.780
"Just hold my hand.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.715
"Walk me to the car.
Just walk me to the car.

39:45.816 --> 39:46.950
"Come on, just walk me
to the car.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.218
"He doesn't know
the difference, dude.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.652
"Just walk me
to the freaking car.

39:49.754 --> 39:50.687
Come on."

39:50.788 --> 39:52.222
I get to the cop car.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.491
He throws me in the backseat,
right, and slams the door.

39:54.592 --> 39:55.925
And I ask him,

39:56.026 --> 39:58.828
"Is it okay if I yell out
the window to freak out my kid?"

39:58.929 --> 40:00.563
"You want to use
the microphone?" "Yeah!"

40:00.664 --> 40:02.465
Freaking...
[imitates microphone feedback]

40:02.566 --> 40:03.666
"Here you go, sir."

40:03.768 --> 40:05.535
And he hands me the microphone,
and I said,

40:05.636 --> 40:06.903
"Frankie, this is the police.

40:07.004 --> 40:08.438
"We have your father.

40:08.539 --> 40:10.874
"We're coming back for you
in one hour.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.208
Do your homework."

40:12.309 --> 40:13.343
[imitates siren warbling]

40:13.444 --> 40:15.211
[imitates car driving away]

40:15.312 --> 40:17.580
One minute later,
my girlfriend calls me.

40:17.681 --> 40:19.449
"You're an ass!"

40:19.550 --> 40:20.784
"What's he doing?"

40:20.885 --> 40:23.153
"He's doing his homework."

40:23.254 --> 40:24.988
"That's called parenting, baby."

40:25.089 --> 40:27.090
[cheering and applause]

40:37.168 --> 40:38.468
[sighs, chuckles]

40:38.569 --> 40:39.803
He got even with me, though.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.871
He totally got even with me.

40:41.972 --> 40:44.174
I walked in the kitchen
one morning.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.543
He's sitting there,
and he looks at me, and he goes,

40:46.644 --> 40:48.778
"Gabriel, I have a question
for you.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.414
What's a hooker?"

40:51.515 --> 40:52.682
[sternly]
"What did you say?"

40:52.783 --> 40:53.683
"What's a hooker?"

40:53.784 --> 40:54.918
"Where did you hear that?"

40:55.019 --> 40:57.253
"I was watching HBO,
and there was a commercial

40:57.354 --> 40:59.022
"for a show
called Hookers at the Point.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.890
"It said,
'This Saturday at 1 1:30,

41:00.991 --> 41:02.792
"check out all the hookers.'

41:02.893 --> 41:04.060
What's that mean?"

41:04.161 --> 41:06.062
"That means we're going out
Saturday."

41:06.163 --> 41:07.464
"What's a hooker?"

41:07.565 --> 41:08.598
"Let it go, dude."

41:08.699 --> 41:10.033
"Tell me."
"You don't need to know."

41:10.134 --> 41:12.068
"Tell me."
"Frankie, that's for adults."

41:12.169 --> 41:13.303
"You said I was an adult."

41:13.404 --> 41:14.904
"I said you eat like an adult.

41:15.005 --> 41:16.372
"And what you do
in the bathroom,

41:16.474 --> 41:17.707
"you are grown up---
trust me---

41:17.808 --> 41:19.776
but you don't need to know
what a hooker is."

41:19.877 --> 41:21.277
He throws a fit in the kitchen.

41:21.378 --> 41:24.481
"Hooker! Hooker!
Hooker! Hooker!"

41:24.582 --> 41:26.115
"What are you doing?"
"Hooker!"

41:26.217 --> 41:27.217
He won't stop.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.285
I don't know what to do,
so I snapped.

41:29.386 --> 41:30.353
"Quit it!"

41:30.454 --> 41:31.554
And he stopped.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.957
And apparently,
his mom heard that.

41:34.058 --> 41:36.226
Mm-hmm,
and as soon as I yelled,

41:36.327 --> 41:38.261
[laughing]
Oh...my God,

41:38.362 --> 41:40.396
he went from being my son

41:40.498 --> 41:43.233
to my girlfriend's little cub
once again.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.236
And here she comes from
the other side of the house,

41:46.337 --> 41:48.505
mama lion, to protect
her little, you know...

41:48.606 --> 41:50.607
[mimics theme from
The Lion King]

41:52.610 --> 41:55.512
[roaring]

41:55.613 --> 41:57.881
[imitating hoofbeats]

41:57.982 --> 41:59.682
I could see her coming.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.217
[screams]

42:01.318 --> 42:02.852
[roaring]

42:02.953 --> 42:04.153
"Why are you yelling
at my baby?"

42:04.255 --> 42:05.221
Oh, my God.

42:05.322 --> 42:06.956
"He wants to know
what a hooker is."

42:07.057 --> 42:08.224
[crying]
"And that's why you're yelling?"

42:08.325 --> 42:09.292
Tears, right?

42:09.393 --> 42:10.793
"You said,
if he had any questions,

42:10.895 --> 42:12.061
he could come to you."

42:12.162 --> 42:14.197
"I didn't know
he was going to ask me that."

42:14.298 --> 42:16.199
"You said, 'Don't worry, baby.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.200
'"I'm the man.

42:17.301 --> 42:19.536
I'll take care of it."'

42:21.472 --> 42:22.539
"Tell him."

42:22.640 --> 42:23.673
"Are you serious?"

42:23.774 --> 42:25.141
"Tell him now."

42:25.242 --> 42:28.077
[sighs]

42:28.178 --> 42:30.413
"Frankie, you want to know
what a hooker is?"

42:30.514 --> 42:31.548
"Yeah."

42:31.649 --> 42:33.483
"Those are your mom's friends."

42:33.584 --> 42:36.419
[audience laughing]

42:41.625 --> 42:43.293
[imitates car speeding away]

42:46.430 --> 42:48.197
They don't like me anyway.

42:48.299 --> 42:50.533
At least now, when they come
over to the house---

42:50.634 --> 42:52.168
"Frankie, who's at the door?"

42:52.269 --> 42:54.737
"Hookers are here."

42:54.838 --> 42:56.272
My buddies are like,
"What did he say?"

42:56.373 --> 42:58.041
"Happy birthday."

42:58.142 --> 42:59.576
[cackling]

42:59.677 --> 43:01.911
Oh, my God.

43:03.180 --> 43:05.214
Noticing we got a soldier
in the front row, man.

43:05.316 --> 43:07.050
How you doing, bro?

43:07.151 --> 43:09.719
US Army?
[cheering and applause]

43:09.820 --> 43:11.588
Thanks for coming, man.

43:11.689 --> 43:13.489
What's your name?

43:14.725 --> 43:16.693
I can see...yeah,
I can read the last name,

43:16.794 --> 43:18.194
Fuentes,
but what's your name?

43:18.295 --> 43:19.963
What's that?
Ricardo.

43:20.064 --> 43:21.164
Ricardo...
you're in El Paso.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.932
"Ricardo, cabron. "

43:23.033 --> 43:25.568
Save Ricardo
for over there, okay?

43:25.669 --> 43:27.303
Okay? "Ricardo!"

43:27.404 --> 43:29.305
I want you to sound like you're
in one of those noveIas.

[suavely] "It's Ricardo."

43:35.679 --> 43:37.747
Sorry, man, I'm just giving you
a tough time, man.

43:37.848 --> 43:38.982
But thank you for coming, man.

43:39.083 --> 43:40.450
Thank you for what you do.

43:40.551 --> 43:41.918
[cheering and applause]

43:42.019 --> 43:44.721
Seriously, bro.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.790
I did a tour recently

43:47.891 --> 43:49.892
called "Around in the World
in Eight Days."

43:49.994 --> 43:53.529
We went to, uh, Iraq,
Afghanistan, Germany, Turkey,

43:53.631 --> 43:57.367
uh, Greenland,
Alaska, and Los Angeles.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.869
They had to drop me off.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.904
Iraq was crazy, you guys.

44:02.006 --> 44:04.140
When you land in Iraq,
it's not like landing here,

44:04.241 --> 44:06.209
you know, in El Paso,
where the plane comes in...

44:06.310 --> 44:07.477
[imitates landing airplane]

44:07.578 --> 44:10.246
Over there, people take shots
at the planes,

44:10.347 --> 44:11.781
so the plane comes in like this.

44:11.882 --> 44:13.349
Like that.

44:13.450 --> 44:14.651
And then, at the last minute...

44:14.752 --> 44:16.152
[imitates whooshing airplane]

44:16.253 --> 44:18.021
Caca.

44:18.122 --> 44:19.822
The whole plane smelled
like chimichangas.

44:19.923 --> 44:21.090
It was terrible.

[groans]

44:25.396 --> 44:27.063
[laughter]

44:27.164 --> 44:28.531
That, for me, was one

44:28.632 --> 44:31.334
of the scariest shows
of my life, man.

44:31.435 --> 44:33.736
I'm in Iraq,
middle of the night.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.471
Outside.

44:35.572 --> 44:37.306
No tent.

44:37.408 --> 44:39.542
Pitch black, helicopter flying,

44:39.643 --> 44:41.477
and there's a spotlight on me.

44:41.578 --> 44:42.745
[laughter]

44:42.846 --> 44:44.447
And I'm supposed to be funny.

44:49.486 --> 44:50.687

44:50.788 --> 44:53.189
And the crazy part
is that I saw a sign

44:53.290 --> 44:55.058
that was very familiar.

44:55.159 --> 44:57.927
They have Subways in Iraq.

44:58.028 --> 45:00.296
I was, like, "Is that?
What is that? Is that?

45:00.397 --> 45:02.098
"It's Subway. Oh, my God!

45:02.199 --> 45:03.266
Yeah!"

45:03.367 --> 45:05.001
I got back to my room.

45:05.102 --> 45:07.537
They have the stupid commercial
there too, in their language.

45:07.638 --> 45:09.372
Oh, my God, I almost lost it.

It's crazy, man.

45:27.991 --> 45:29.459
You know what was crazy, bro?

45:29.560 --> 45:30.660
When I was in Iraq,

45:30.761 --> 45:32.228
they wanted me to go
to different bases,

45:32.329 --> 45:35.098
but they wouldn't let me go
because they have to provide you

45:35.199 --> 45:37.033
with a helmet
and a bulletproof vest.

45:37.134 --> 45:40.403

does not have a Big and Tall.

that 75-pound vest on me.

It looked like
a bulletproof bib.

Uh-uh.

No, man.

45:59.256 --> 46:00.356
We flew into Korea.

46:00.457 --> 46:02.458
That threw me off
a little bit too.

46:02.559 --> 46:05.995
We go to check into the hotel,
and it was kind of scary for me,

46:06.096 --> 46:08.731
because the phone had
a big sticker on it that said,

46:08.832 --> 46:11.067

47:03.754 --> 47:06.255

there's problems everywhere.

47:06.356 --> 47:08.257
Cops used to mess with me a lot.

47:08.358 --> 47:10.259

I love getting recognized now.

they give you
these little taquitos,

and there's, like, a sauce,
and you pour it.

And it was local,
so I took 'em home.

51:11.735 --> 51:13.269
And that is an argument

51:13.370 --> 51:15.404
that nobody in this building
has ever had

51:15.505 --> 51:16.972
at 3:00 in the morning.

51:17.074 --> 51:19.742
'Cause you don't just walk
into the house with 1 1 cakes.

51:19.843 --> 51:20.943
You make some noise.

51:21.044 --> 51:22.178
You know.

51:22.279 --> 51:24.814
[imitates doors slamming open
and footsteps]

51:26.850 --> 51:28.884
And I walk in
with the last two cakes,

51:28.985 --> 51:30.319
and my girlfriend's
in the kitchen.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.154
And she's, like,
"What the hell is this?!"

51:32.255 --> 51:33.956
I'm trying to be cute.
"It's a bakery."

51:34.057 --> 51:36.058
[laughter and applause]

51:37.994 --> 51:39.895
"Where did you get
all this cake?"

51:39.996 --> 51:42.598
I said, "Baby, the people
at the show brought it."

51:42.699 --> 51:44.867
"Are you gonna eat all of it?"

51:44.968 --> 51:46.535
"Eventually.

51:46.636 --> 51:49.305
I'm not gonna do it
in one hit, you know?"

51:49.406 --> 51:51.440
Freaking two hours later.
"Clear!"

51:53.443 --> 51:54.944
[laughter]

51:55.045 --> 51:58.380
"How do you know someone
isn't trying to poison you?"

51:58.482 --> 51:59.748
"With cake?
Are you serious?"

51:59.850 --> 52:01.684
It's, like,
you live by the cake,

52:01.785 --> 52:03.886
you die by the cake, you know?

52:03.987 --> 52:05.221
No.

52:05.322 --> 52:06.489
Uh-uh.

52:06.590 --> 52:08.958
So we're going back
and forth, right?

52:09.059 --> 52:10.359
We wake up Frankie,

52:10.460 --> 52:11.927
and Frankie walks
into the kitchen

52:12.028 --> 52:14.130
at 3:00 in the morning,
and he's, all...

52:14.231 --> 52:16.398
[mumbling]

52:19.803 --> 52:21.604
"Where did all the cake
come from?"

52:21.705 --> 52:23.772
"The people
at the show brought it."

52:23.874 --> 52:25.341
"Tell 'em I said thank you."

52:25.442 --> 52:28.043
"I'll tell 'em
you said thank you, Frankie."

52:28.145 --> 52:29.812
"Gabriel, how come
they bring you cake?"

52:29.913 --> 52:32.515
'"Cause ten years ago,
I did a joke where I said,

52:32.616 --> 52:34.583
'"I love chocolate cake.'

52:34.684 --> 52:36.152
Now people bring me cake."

52:36.253 --> 52:38.287
"You should say
you love Transformers."

52:38.388 --> 52:39.889
[laughter]

52:39.990 --> 52:41.624
I'll start doing it, all right?

52:41.725 --> 52:43.325
So my girl's, like,
"Baby, put Frankie to bed."

52:43.426 --> 52:45.227
I go, "Frankie,
you got to go back to sleep."

52:45.328 --> 52:46.795
[grunting]
"Want some cake?"

52:46.897 --> 52:48.197
"Yeah."

52:48.298 --> 52:50.533
So I grab one of these tiny
cakes that somebody brought me.

52:50.634 --> 52:51.901
One of those little tiny ones

52:52.002 --> 52:54.069
that has the plastic cover
and the sticker on the side.

52:54.171 --> 52:55.771
And I handed to him.
I go, "Here."

52:55.872 --> 52:57.173
He goes, "A little piece?"

52:57.274 --> 52:59.275
I go, "Dude, it's a small cake.

52:59.376 --> 53:01.277
You can have the whole thing."

53:01.378 --> 53:03.279
And the look
that came over his face

53:03.380 --> 53:07.183
at 3:00 in the morning
was like he got a gift from God.

53:07.284 --> 53:08.584
[laughter]

53:08.685 --> 53:10.386
I said, "Here,"
and he was, like....

53:10.487 --> 53:12.855
[humming reverential
religious tune]

53:16.126 --> 53:18.027
[applause, cheering
and laughter]

53:18.128 --> 53:20.129
[whistling and applause]

53:22.199 --> 53:23.599
"Take it to your room."

53:23.700 --> 53:25.901
[singing in Latin]

53:26.002 --> 53:28.003
[laughter and applause]

53:34.044 --> 53:36.745
I went to go take him
to school the next morning.

53:36.846 --> 53:38.614
He's in the bathroom crying.

53:38.715 --> 53:40.115
[imitates sobbing]

53:40.217 --> 53:41.617
"Hey, are you okay?"

53:41.718 --> 53:43.052
"Oh, my stomach!"

53:43.153 --> 53:44.253
"Your stomach?

53:44.354 --> 53:45.487
Too much cake?"

53:45.589 --> 53:46.722
"Yeah."

53:46.823 --> 53:48.023
"Was it good?"

53:48.124 --> 53:49.291
"Hell, yeah."

53:49.392 --> 53:50.859
"I'll see you in the car."

53:50.961 --> 53:52.962
20 minutes later,
he comes to the car,

53:53.063 --> 53:54.230
and he's all sweaty.

53:54.331 --> 53:55.664
[breathing heavily]

53:55.765 --> 53:57.032
"You all right? What happened?"

53:57.133 --> 53:58.234
"I blew it up."

53:58.335 --> 53:59.401
"Get in the car."

53:59.502 --> 54:01.036
[imitates engine revving]

54:01.137 --> 54:03.339
I get him to school
45 minutes late.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.474
Usually, when I drop him off,
you guys,

54:05.575 --> 54:07.710
I leave him on the side
of the school,

54:07.811 --> 54:09.411
and they have, like,
a drop-off zone

54:09.512 --> 54:11.247
with cones and a supervisor

54:11.348 --> 54:13.549
to make sure
that your kid gets off safely.

54:13.650 --> 54:15.684
When you're 45 minutes late,
there's nobody there,

54:15.785 --> 54:18.053
so I left him
in front of the school.

54:18.154 --> 54:19.355
And apparently, that's a no-no.

54:19.456 --> 54:20.889
You're not supposed to do that.

54:20.991 --> 54:22.258
I didn't know, you know?

54:22.359 --> 54:23.459
[engine purring, tires squeal]

54:23.560 --> 54:24.693
"Go for it."

54:24.794 --> 54:26.228
"I'm not supposed to..."

54:26.329 --> 54:28.297
"I know, dude. Just go.
You're late. Go."

54:28.398 --> 54:29.765
[grunting]

54:29.866 --> 54:31.066
[door closes, squeaking]

54:31.167 --> 54:32.768
Out of nowhere,
here comes the principal.

54:32.869 --> 54:34.903
And I know it's the principal,
'cause he's, like,

54:35.005 --> 54:36.372
"It's the principal!
It's the principal!

54:36.473 --> 54:37.806
It's the principal!
It's the principal!"

54:37.907 --> 54:40.442
"Dude, relax. I'm 30.
I don't give a damn."

54:40.543 --> 54:42.344
Here comes the principal.

54:42.445 --> 54:46.749
"Sir? Sir, this is not
the designated drop-off area.

54:46.850 --> 54:49.952
"Please take your child to
the other side of the school.

54:50.053 --> 54:51.954
You cannot leave him here."

54:52.055 --> 54:53.155
I was, like...

54:53.256 --> 54:55.024
[whispering]
"Watch this."

54:55.125 --> 54:56.358
Senora...

54:56.459 --> 54:58.661
[speaking Spanish]

54:58.762 --> 55:00.763
[laughter]

55:04.267 --> 55:06.835
[applause, cheering
and laughter]

55:06.936 --> 55:08.671
"That's how you do it, homeboy.

55:08.772 --> 55:10.039
That's how you do it."

55:10.140 --> 55:13.342
That principal was amazing,
'cause she was, like,

55:13.443 --> 55:16.378
"Usted no puede
dejar su hijo aqui.

55:16.479 --> 55:20.649
"Saca la huelta a la otro lado
de Ia escueIa.

55:20.750 --> 55:24.320
"Aya, si, si,
aqui, no, no.

55:24.421 --> 55:27.790
"Aya, si, si, aqui, no, no.

55:27.891 --> 55:31.026
Yo no soy pendeja."

55:31.127 --> 55:33.362
[applause, cheering
and laughter]

55:40.870 --> 55:42.338
Did that really happen?

55:42.439 --> 55:43.639
Yes.

55:43.740 --> 55:45.140
Mm-hmm.

55:45.241 --> 55:47.710
I felt so bad 'cause when
I picked up Frankie, he's like,

55:47.811 --> 55:48.877
"The principal yelled at me."

55:48.978 --> 55:49.878
I'm like, "I'm sorry."

55:49.979 --> 55:50.913
"I'm gonna tell my mom."

55:51.014 --> 55:52.781
"No.

55:52.882 --> 55:54.083
It's all right, dude."

55:54.184 --> 55:56.151
We're having a good time
right now with his mom.

55:56.252 --> 55:57.386
And it sucks, you guys,

55:57.487 --> 55:59.288
'cause we got into a fight
that weekend.

55:59.389 --> 56:01.590
Eh... it was not too big,

56:01.691 --> 56:04.126
but it was, like, it was---
it could have been prevented.

56:04.227 --> 56:07.062
My girlfriend's backing
the car up out of the driveway,

56:07.163 --> 56:08.397
and somebody had left,
like, this---

56:08.498 --> 56:09.498
I guess they were moving,

56:09.599 --> 56:12.167
and they left this big box
behind the car,

56:12.268 --> 56:13.369
and my girlfriend's backing up,

56:13.470 --> 56:15.337
and I go,
"Baby, baby, there's a box."

56:15.438 --> 56:16.338
"I got it."

56:16.439 --> 56:17.506
[crashing sound]

56:17.607 --> 56:18.640
[laughter]

56:18.742 --> 56:19.908
Even Frankie was like,

56:20.009 --> 56:21.877
"Mom, he told you
there was a box right there."

56:21.978 --> 56:23.278
"Shut up!"

56:23.380 --> 56:25.914
So we get inside the house,
and I looked at her and I said,

56:26.015 --> 56:28.517
"What the hell is your problem?"

56:28.618 --> 56:30.419
And sure enough,
Frankie walks up.

56:30.520 --> 56:31.854
[whimpering
"You guys are going to fight."

56:31.955 --> 56:33.422
I'm like, "Oh, shoot---
no, no, no, I'm sorry, Frankie.

56:33.523 --> 56:34.423
We're not fighting."

56:34.524 --> 56:35.424
"You're yelling at my mom."

56:35.525 --> 56:36.792
"No, no, no, no, no,
I love your mom.

56:36.893 --> 56:38.827
She just didn't hear me."

56:38.928 --> 56:39.862
"You're not mad at her?"

56:39.963 --> 56:40.929
"No, I'm not mad at your mom.

56:41.030 --> 56:42.664
"Baby, I love you, I love you.

56:42.766 --> 56:44.299
See, I love your mom---
I love you."

56:44.401 --> 56:45.467
[kissing]

56:45.568 --> 56:46.769
"I love your mom;
everything's cool.

56:46.870 --> 56:48.303
"You want to go play
some video games or something?

56:48.405 --> 56:50.239
Come on, I'll go play with you."
"Okay." "Okay, come on.

56:50.340 --> 56:51.907
I'm not mad at your mom,
dude, come on, let's go.

56:52.008 --> 56:53.175
Say bye to your mom."
"Bye, Mom."

56:53.276 --> 56:54.443
"Come on, let's go,
come on, we're cool.

56:54.544 --> 56:55.811
I'm not mad at her;
come on, let's go."

56:55.912 --> 56:58.213
[mouthing]

57:01.251 --> 57:02.718
"Come on, let's go."

57:02.819 --> 57:04.586
See, some of you are laughing,
some are like,

57:04.687 --> 57:06.588
"Did---
can he really say that?"

57:06.689 --> 57:09.358
[laughing]
I snuck it in there, huh?

57:09.459 --> 57:10.526
[sighs]

57:10.627 --> 57:12.127
No, no fighting.

57:12.228 --> 57:14.797
But I had to make up the fact
that I yelled at Frankie.

57:14.898 --> 57:17.199
I go, "Frankie, whatever
you want to do, let's do it."

57:17.300 --> 57:18.634
"Gabriel, can we go
to an arcade?"

57:18.735 --> 57:19.802
"Arcade?

57:19.903 --> 57:22.838
Dude, you have a Nintendo Wii
at your house."

57:22.939 --> 57:25.073
And then I had a flashback
to 20 years ago.

57:25.175 --> 57:26.308
[in shrill voice]
"¿Que, que? Arcade?

57:26.409 --> 57:28.177
"Cabron, tu tienes
un Nintendo en la casa.

57:28.278 --> 57:30.112
You have a Nintendo at home."

57:30.213 --> 57:32.815
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
I'm turning into my mom.

57:32.916 --> 57:33.849
Come on, dude, let's go."

57:33.950 --> 57:35.350
[imitates engine]

57:35.452 --> 57:38.253
I take him to this big old
freaking arcade, right?

57:38.354 --> 57:40.522
And I felt so out of it
because I didn't know

57:40.623 --> 57:43.058
you couldn't put money
in the machines anymore.

57:43.159 --> 57:44.526
I'm---
Man, I remember quarters.

57:44.627 --> 57:45.594
I'm thinking,
"Here, five bucks,"

57:45.695 --> 57:46.662
and he's, like,
looking at me like,

57:46.763 --> 57:48.497
"Hmm?"

57:48.598 --> 57:49.565
"What? Go play,"

57:49.666 --> 57:50.866
and he's like---
he came right back.

57:50.967 --> 57:51.967
"All done."
I'm like, "Dude."

57:52.068 --> 57:53.235
I didn't know this.

57:53.336 --> 57:54.670
You have to go
to another machine,

57:54.771 --> 57:56.638
put in money,
and then it gives you a card,

57:56.739 --> 57:59.141
and then you swipe that card
to play video games.

57:59.242 --> 58:01.810
And the game he wants to play
doesn't cost a quarter.

58:01.911 --> 58:03.479
It costs three dollars.

58:03.580 --> 58:04.713
A game.

58:04.814 --> 58:06.982
Big old machine called
Dance Dance Revolution.

58:07.083 --> 58:07.983
[light cheering]

58:08.084 --> 58:08.984
Some of you know this game?

58:09.085 --> 58:10.552
Yeah, maybe, sort of.

58:10.653 --> 58:13.155
For those of you that don't know
the game, it's pretty simple.

58:13.256 --> 58:15.023
It's a dancing game,
and there's a big screen

58:15.124 --> 58:16.391
and then arrows come out
to music,

58:16.493 --> 58:17.860
and whatever arrow comes out,

58:17.961 --> 58:21.597
that's the arrow you have
to step on when it comes out.

58:21.698 --> 58:24.700
Kind of cool,
but all the music is techno

58:24.801 --> 58:26.368
and it's loud.

58:26.469 --> 58:28.003
I know I'm getting older
'cause I'm like,

58:28.104 --> 58:30.138
"They got to turn that down."

58:30.240 --> 58:32.674
[as male announcer] "Dance
Dance Revolution Revolution.

58:32.775 --> 58:33.809
Get ready."

58:33.910 --> 58:35.244
And the kids are like,
"I'm ready."

58:35.345 --> 58:37.112
"Select music."

58:37.213 --> 58:40.482
[beatboxing techno]

58:40.583 --> 58:41.483
[light cheering]

58:41.584 --> 58:42.851
And that's what they dance to.

58:42.952 --> 58:44.386
"Ready, go!"

58:44.487 --> 58:47.422
[beatboxing techno]

58:47.524 --> 58:49.892
[audience cheering]

58:56.466 --> 58:59.067
"Perfect."
And the kid's like, "Whoo!"

58:59.168 --> 59:03.438
And I'm like...
[panting]

59:04.507 --> 59:06.408
I love this game,

59:06.509 --> 59:09.344
but they need to have something
that's more fluffy-friendly,

59:09.445 --> 59:12.514
so that fluffy people
and parents can hang and enjoy.

59:12.615 --> 59:15.617
We're watching this game
for over an hour.

59:15.718 --> 59:17.352
I told Frankie,
"Let's go play another game

59:17.453 --> 59:19.922
and then we'll come back
when the line goes down."

59:20.023 --> 59:21.623
"The line never goes down."

59:21.724 --> 59:22.824
Great.

59:22.926 --> 59:25.827
So I'm watching kid
after kid after kid.

59:25.929 --> 59:29.364
You know, like, "Serious?

59:29.465 --> 59:30.732
How much is it?"

59:30.833 --> 59:32.067
"It's three dollars a dance."

59:32.168 --> 59:33.569
"Three dollars a dance?"

59:33.670 --> 59:34.803
And then I thought about it.

59:34.904 --> 59:37.472
Well, I paid $20
two nights ago, so...

59:37.574 --> 59:39.141
I guess three dollars
isn't that bad.

59:39.242 --> 59:40.242
[laughs]

59:40.343 --> 59:43.445
Now that I think about it.

59:43.546 --> 59:45.080
Some of you are clapping,
some are like,

59:45.181 --> 59:46.715
"I don't get it."

59:46.816 --> 59:49.818
Yeah, whatever, anyway.

59:50.820 --> 59:51.920
So kid after kid.

59:52.021 --> 59:54.690
Then I found something out.

59:54.791 --> 59:58.460
You can always spot that one kid
who you just know

59:58.561 --> 01:00:00.729
is going to grow up
to be a little bit more...

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:03.565
creative...

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.934
than others
by the way he plays the game.

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:08.070
And all the other little kids---
they know something's up.

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.237
They're like, "You got to watch.

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:10.939
"When Benji plays,
you got to watch.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.541
Watch."

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.476
Sure enough,
here comes Benji, right?

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.211
"Dance Dance Revolution.

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.346
Get ready."

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.748
[in effeminate voice]
"I'm so ready."

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:24.486
I'm like, "Whoa...
oh, it's on."

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:26.021
"Select music."

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:29.524
[beatboxing techno]

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:30.959
"Ready, go!"

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.594
This dude took off.

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:35.697
[beatboxing techno]

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:46.274
[audience cheering]

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:50.846
"Perfect."

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:52.681
"I know."

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:54.349
I'm like, "Wow."

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:55.517
Frankie's like, "I'm next."

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:57.119
I go, "You can't follow that.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.287
"You better come over here and
play some Street Fighter, man.

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:00.756
"Let me show you
how to throw a fireball.

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.491
Get your butt over here."

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:04.860
Oh, my God.

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:07.229
I had to make it up to him
another way.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.330
I had to take him...

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.799
to Disneyland.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.668
I stopped going to Disneyland
a long time ago.

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:13.835
Because you know what?

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:17.205
Those roller coasters
are not fluffy-friendly.

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:18.407
Disney cares.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.708
That's why there's safety there.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.610
You know, they have
all those different harnesses.

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:25.681
And if you're over 300 pounds,
just stay in the parking lot.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:27.449
You know, 'cause they got
the whole, you know...

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:31.953
[clicking]

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.989
You're fluffy, forget it.

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.992
That's why I love
a ghetto-ass carnival.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:39.594
You know, those ones
they build in, like, six hours?

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.963
I can still ride
those roller coasters.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:44.032
It's only one bar,
three clicks, that's it.

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:45.067
If it locks, good.

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:47.669
If it doesn't, "Hold on!"

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.372
[hissing, clicking]

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:51.907
Plus, fluffy people never fall.

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:52.908
We never fall.

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.042
You know who falls?

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.777
The skinny guy
that got stuck next to us.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.512
[laughter]

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:59.448
That's who...
[screams]

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.449
More room.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.852
[laughs]

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:05.487
But me and Disney, no.

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:06.555
No mas.

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:09.291
But I had to
because I messed up.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.960
I fell asleep on the couch,
and I woke up all, you know...

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:12.994
[groaning]

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:14.496
...and Frankie was watching TV.

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:18.734
He goes, "Look, Gabriel,
look, Disneyland."

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.902
And I was like, "Dude,
what's the big deal, okay?

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:21.903
"It's Disneyland.

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:24.172
What, you've never gone?"

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:28.477
all: Aw...

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.747
- "My dad never took me."

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:34.783
Oh, mother...

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:36.685
Next morning...

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.019
[whirring]

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:39.020
[brakes screeching]

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.188
[hissing]

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.224
"Welcome to the magical world
of Disney."

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:45.026
We walk in the park;
he's all happy.

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:46.895
[laughs]

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:49.397
We get into the middle
of the park, and he's so funny.

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:51.199
He starts getting winded.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.169
I thought it was hysterical
because up until then,

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.037
I only saw myself get like that,
you know.

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:58.573
[panting]

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:00.075
So to see
a little ten-year-old version...

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.643
[high-pitched panting]

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:02.744
[shrieks]

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:04.312
[laughing]
Hysterical. I was dying.

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.181
I go, "Frankie,
you want to take a break?"

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:08.683
"Mm-hmm, Gabriel,
this park is big."

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:09.951
I'm like, "See?

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:13.121
"It's not a small world
after all.

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:15.290
Like, whatever, dude, sit down."

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:17.325
So we're sitting down, waiting.

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.961
All of a sudden, I start getting
recognized at Disneyland,

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.196
and that, for me, was cool.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.564
You know,
people were walking by.

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.800
[indistinct whispering]

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.668
"Fluffy, can we take a picture?"

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:27.803
"Sure."

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.604
[whooshing]
And then... more people.

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:30.939
"It's him."

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.574
"It's that guy."

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.975
"Pikachu."

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.610
Now I have, like,
ten people around me

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:37.746
like I'm a new character
at the park.

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:39.681
Best part is
Frankie starts getting annoyed.

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.116
He's like...

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:43.685
[groaning] "Why don't
they leave you alone?"

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:46.254
"Frankie, these are the people
that come to the shows.

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:49.124
They're the reason
why you have a PlayStation."

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:50.559
[exhaling]

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.595
[as Frankie]
"Thank you."

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:55.764
"Here, now, start taking
the pictures."

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:56.865
[laughs]

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.099
So I told Frankie,

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.467
"Frankie, what ride
are you going to get on?"

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:00.502
"Ride?"
"Yeah.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.003
What ride do you want
to get on?"

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:04.906
"I don't want to get on a ride."

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:07.475
"What the hell are we doing
at Disneyland?"

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.377
"The commercial said
that Disneyland is

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:11.813
the happiest place on Earth."

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:14.216
"Oh, my God.

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:16.484
"That's IHOP.

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:20.021
The hell are we doing here?"

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:24.993
We're hanging out at IHOP, and,
you know, we started talking,

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:28.096
and it was kind of like a little
bonding moment because Frankie---

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:30.765
his dad isn't in the picture and
my dad wasn't in the picture,

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.234
so for some reason, you know,

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.769
we got a little connection
going on and it's pretty cool.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.838
Frankie told me something,
and it got me right here.

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:38.640
He goes--- you know,
I'm talking to him.

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.041
I said, "Frankie," I says,

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:43.278
"do you ever want to, you know,
talk or see your real dad?"

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:46.448
And he goes,
"You are my real dad."

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.184
I was like, "Oh..."

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:50.819
And then he followed it up
with this---

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.455
"I want my last name
to be Iglesias."

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.790
[grunting]

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.025
And then his mom walked in.

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:58.994
"Me too."

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:01.763
They work together,
they work together.

01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:02.831
I knew it.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:03.832
It's a tag team.

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.333
[murmuring]

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:08.637
Whatever.

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:13.742
Eh, another time, I took 'em
to IHOP, you guys--- too funny.

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.610
We walk in there,
we got my buddy Noah.

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:18.747
We went to go eat, tore it up,
walked out into the parking lot,

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:21.249
and discovered
that my car had been stolen.

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.250
[audience groaning]

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.485
Yeah, uh-huh.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:24.486
I was full too.
I'm like...

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.454
[groans]

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:29.925
"We got to walk."

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:31.226
My buddy Noah---
he's trying to be helpful.

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.094
He's like, "Gabriel,
don't you have OnStar?"

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.330
I'm like, "Yeah,
but it's in the car, stupid."

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.332
"Well, can't you call
the 800 number?

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.700
Maybe they can track your car."

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.335
I'm like, "Oh, shoot,
Noah, you're a genius."

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.703
So I pull out my cell phone

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.138
and my freaking, you know,
OnStar card,

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.172
and I call 'em up.

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.907
[phone rings]

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:47.709

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:17.472
"Kim, they just stole my car
from IHOP."

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:18.473
"I'm very sorry, sir.

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:19.574
Can I get your OnStar number?"

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:21.343
"Actually, Kim,
I can't read the card.

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.581
"Sir, just give me your name."

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.650
"Okay, my name is
Gabriel Iglesias."
