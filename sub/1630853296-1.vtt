WEBVTT

00:13.138 --> 00:15.557
- Should've brought
my swim trunks.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.192
Oh, going inside?

00:33.241 --> 00:36.745
Wow, hey, this is classy.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.583
No carpet, huh?

00:41.666 --> 00:43.209
Elegant.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.756
I don't get it.

00:47.839 --> 00:51.176
What is this,
one of those modern art things?

00:59.058 --> 01:00.477
- Dad?

01:03.396 --> 01:04.606
Are you sure you're not mad

01:04.689 --> 01:06.107
that I brought you
to the Hub?

01:06.941 --> 01:09.194
- Well, that's
an interesting way to put it.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.403
You drugged me...

01:12.238 --> 01:13.406
Kidnapped me.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.495
You put me in a replica
of my house,

01:18.578 --> 01:20.747
took away my everyday reality.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.462
I'm kidding.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.506
What, of c--how could I
be mad at you?

01:29.589 --> 01:30.673
You saved my life.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.969
- I couldn't lose you.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.779
There's one more thing.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.072
- Jesus Christ!

02:01.162 --> 02:03.081
- I didn't...plan it.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.458
It just...

02:05.542 --> 02:06.876
happened.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.214
- This a pickle.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.344
This a big
dead-billionaire pickle.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.432
- So in terms
of disposing the body--

02:21.516 --> 02:22.517
- Hazel.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.644
- He's still alive!

02:31.025 --> 02:32.151
- Okay.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.573
- Okay, all right.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.514
Finish the job.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.149
No, no, no.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.572
- Hazel.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.459
Hazel.
- What?

03:29.542 --> 03:30.793
- You were smiling just now.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.211
What were you thinking about?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.798
- Golf.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.262
Oh. Welcome.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.555
Welcome, Dr. Hau.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.015
Yes, Hazel, this is Dr. Hau.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.684
This is the physician
who will be overseeing

03:46.768 --> 03:47.810
Herbert's treatment.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.145
- Pleasure to meet you, Hazel.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.313
- Please, sit down.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.983
- So how do you plan
on treating my dad's cancer

03:54.067 --> 03:55.443
without him knowing?
- Well, that's--

03:55.526 --> 03:57.987
that is the magic of the Hub,
actually--

03:58.071 --> 04:00.657
- I was asking the doctor.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.492
- Of course, yeah.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.953
- Well, we've designed
a process for your father

04:05.036 --> 04:06.955
that makes it seamless.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.706
The painkillers Herbert takes
every morning

04:08.790 --> 04:11.584
have been replaced
with fast-acting sedatives.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.211
- Oh, jeez, it's30 already.

04:13.294 --> 04:17.215
All right, enough sitting
around the breakfast table.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.385
Let's go sit on the couch.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.429
What? Unless you got a--

04:28.393 --> 04:29.769
- Once he's unconscious,

04:29.852 --> 04:31.479
Bennett will alert
the medical team.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.571
- The medical team
will retrieve Herbert...

04:41.823 --> 04:43.491
- And transport him next door

04:43.574 --> 04:45.576
to a state-of-the-art
medical cube.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.870
It's a medical facility
and treatment center

04:47.954 --> 04:49.747
all in one.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.971
- When the session
is finished,

05:05.054 --> 05:06.806
the team will return Herbert.

05:17.316 --> 05:18.735
- Once settled,

05:18.818 --> 05:20.737
they'll reset the time of day
in his home cube

05:20.820 --> 05:22.613
back to the time of departure.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.914
- When Herbert wakes up,
he'll simply think

05:31.998 --> 05:33.750
he drifted off for a moment.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.251
- And I, um--

05:35.334 --> 05:36.669
I got you a gift.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.173
I took your high school watch
from your bedroom

05:40.256 --> 05:42.467
and I retrofitted it.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.928
It's synced to all the clocks
in the ranch,

05:46.012 --> 05:49.307
so if you ever need to know
what time Herbert thinks it is,

05:49.390 --> 05:50.850
it's right there.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.810
And if you wanna know
the real time, you just...

05:58.983 --> 06:02.612
- How do we explain
the side effects to him?

06:02.695 --> 06:05.990
Because with my mom's chemo,
there was a--

06:06.074 --> 06:08.076
- Chemo? No, that's--
that's medieval times.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.537
Like, you might as well put
a jar of leeches on him.

06:11.621 --> 06:16.084
The Hub isn't hindered
by the FDA or ethics boards.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.585
- We're decades ahead--

06:17.668 --> 06:20.797
gene editing, cell therapy,
molecular vaccines

06:20.880 --> 06:22.590
in combination
with nanosurgery.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.842
In fact, the only side effect
your father might experience

06:24.926 --> 06:26.803
would be from the sedatives--

06:26.886 --> 06:28.638
some mild grogginess.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.640
- Which is barely anything.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.018
- So you just happen to be
working on a cure for cancer?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.603
- Hmm.
- Um...

06:35.686 --> 06:37.313
by-product of research,
I guess.

06:37.396 --> 06:40.650
You know, we--did you know
that cancer cells

06:40.733 --> 06:45.196
on a cellular level
actually become immortal?

06:46.489 --> 06:47.657
- So how long?

06:47.740 --> 06:48.950
- Treatment duration
can be based

06:49.033 --> 06:50.409
on a number of factors.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.411
- You know he's using
my father's life

06:52.495 --> 06:54.914
to hold me hostage, right?

06:54.997 --> 06:56.415
So I just wanna know
how long

06:56.499 --> 06:58.167
I have to keep up
this charade for.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.585
- 12 weeks.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.338
- That's the initial estimate
to remission.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.216
- 12 weeks.
I can do 12 weeks.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.179
The second he is better,
we're leaving.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.809
My dad's cancer
is the only reason

07:14.892 --> 07:16.352
that I am here.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.065
- I know.

07:21.149 --> 07:25.194
Can you give me 12 weeks
to try and fix this?

07:27.321 --> 07:29.157
- Well, I'll leave you two--

07:29.240 --> 07:31.951
- I have a question, actually,
Doctor.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.581
When can I get
this fucking chip

07:36.664 --> 07:38.040
taken out of my head?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.834
- Uh--
- Hmm?

07:39.917 --> 07:42.920
- Well, technically,
I could take it out now.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.630
- Yeah, that's a great idea,
actually.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.550
That--we'll have
both of ours taken out.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.886
- You have a chip?

07:51.429 --> 07:52.471
- Yeah.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.266
In a moment of vulnerability,

07:55.349 --> 07:57.143
I had Bennett help me
put one in.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.728
But I never activated it,

07:58.811 --> 08:01.898
because deep down, I knew
that's what you wouldn't want.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.320
Wow.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.071
Husband of the year.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.781
- Thanks.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.338
- What happened?

08:25.421 --> 08:27.590
What was I,
snoozing in my food?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.093
What the--

08:44.524 --> 08:47.193
Why's this water taste, uh,
delicious?

08:57.370 --> 09:00.373
Hmm. So...

09:00.456 --> 09:02.708
crisp.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.586
It's like mountain air.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.840
- All right, listen up,
everybody.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.093
'Cause I'm about to blow
your fucking minds.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.972
Three world-renowned
scientists.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.515
Three not-so-renowned
worker bees

09:17.598 --> 09:20.559
from Gogol plants
around the country.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.645
All these people died
this year.

09:22.728 --> 09:26.983
Sudden accidental deaths
in the prime of their lives.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.901
Terrible tragedies?

09:28.985 --> 09:31.696
Or Gogol's sick
recruitment requirements?

09:31.779 --> 09:33.698
We believe these people
are alive

09:33.781 --> 09:35.825
and working in the Hub.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.952
And now we're about
to find out.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.328
With this guy.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.998
- Uh, hold on. Lights on.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.166
- Oh, come on.
What's the problem, baby?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.795
- The problem, baby, is that
the Twin Sands mission failed.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.630
And I think Hazel
went back to the Hub.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.674
- Yeah, so do we.
And guess what.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.968
We've got you cleared
for an undercover interview

09:54.051 --> 09:55.011
with the Hub.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.387
This could be the biggest case

09:56.470 --> 09:58.097
of our lifetime.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.890
If you find those people,

09:59.974 --> 10:02.101
we've got Gogol
on insurance fraud,

10:02.184 --> 10:03.894
labor conspiracy,
false imprisonment.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.354
Who knows what else?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.231
That sick fuck could be
breeding centaurs.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.400
Fucking centaurs.
- Mm-hmm.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.943
- And the timing
couldn't be better, 'cause--

10:11.027 --> 10:12.153
lights off.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.531
You've got Hazel Gogol
teed up

10:15.615 --> 10:17.366
and ready to become
an informant.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.784
- Lights on.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.370
I spent two days with her.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.081
I didn't lay down
the proper groundwork.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.042
I wanna get Gogol
just as bad as you do,

10:26.125 --> 10:28.044
but I think our next move--
- Lights off.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.337
You wanna talk moves?

10:29.420 --> 10:30.755
Because I'll tell you
what I see.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.423
It looks like
she's begging for it.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.717
And you there, cool guy?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.052
Look how cool you look.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.262
I've never looked
that fucking cool ever.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.389
I wish you'd just acknowledge
you got a gift, my friend.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.058
- Yeah, homie, everybody wants
to sleep with you.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.434
Hell, I wouldn't
kick you out of bed.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.811
- You smell like cinnamon.

10:45.895 --> 10:46.896
- Lights on!

10:48.773 --> 10:50.149
I don't know what to do.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.902
- Just turn
the fucking lights on.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.654
- Nobody knows
where the Hub is.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.406
Okay? There'll be
no way to reach me.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.367
We don't know how to get in.
We do not know how to get out.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.328
I don't know what the plan
of extraction is here.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.751
Fuck it.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.586
I've done worse. Let's do it.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.838
- Team player.
- There he is.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.591
Oh, by the way, your new name?

11:15.674 --> 11:16.926
Jasper.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.933
I came up with that.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.937
- Okay, I need you both
to hold still

11:28.020 --> 11:32.358
for three, two, one.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.741
All done.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.745
- That's it?

11:47.331 --> 11:48.999
After everything
I went through?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.835
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.920
- It's just out of my head
like that?

11:53.003 --> 11:54.171
- Just like that.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.178
- What's gonna happen to these?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.055
They're gonna be destroyed,
right?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.932
- Of course.
They'll be incinerated.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.892
- Yeah, absolutely--oh.

12:06.976 --> 12:07.977
- No!

12:17.486 --> 12:19.613
- You--you okay there?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.953
Yeah.
- Good.

12:26.036 --> 12:29.373
- Well.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.959
I think we're done here.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.883
- Oh, you need an access sensor
in your fingertip.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.010
Dr. Hau, do you mind
putting one in Hazel?

12:44.096 --> 12:45.764
Yeah, right.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.684
You must think
I am really fucking stupid.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.520
I am not letting you
put another chip in my body.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.190
- You mean besides the two
you just swallowed?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.526
The finger sensor
is truly the only method

12:57.610 --> 13:00.196
of getting around in the Hub,
so--

13:00.279 --> 13:03.491
- I might have a work-around.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.914
Herringbone
came to see me in LA

13:09.997 --> 13:11.373
to beg for his job back.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.708
I said no,

13:12.791 --> 13:14.376
but he gave me
his middle finger

13:14.460 --> 13:15.753
as a parting gift.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.610
- How did you know Hazel
would destroy the chips?

13:39.693 --> 13:42.488
- Oh, I know my Hazel.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.616
A lot better
than she'd like to admit.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.786
Were the transfer plates
able to copy the chips' data?

13:50.204 --> 13:52.581
- Yes.
- Great.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.919
- The data mapped onto
its hard drive upon contact.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.337
There.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.880
A copy of Hazel's consciousness
is uploading

13:59.964 --> 14:01.465
to a dedicated network now.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.425
- Excellent. And my copy?

14:03.509 --> 14:05.594
- I'll upload it
to its own network.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.930
- Keep them together.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.225
You know, it's more
romantic that way.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.568
- Come on.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.918
Truck's dead.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.630
It's crazy.
Nothing looks off on it.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.509
Not to be crass, but I know
the inside of its body

14:45.593 --> 14:46.802
as well as I know yours.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.264
It's got
new spark plugs in it too.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.602
Well, I mean, kinda new.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.489
Amos Automotive.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.158
- Yeah, is Amos there?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.827
- Unfortunately, Amos is
unavailable at the moment.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.370
Can I help you?

15:13.454 --> 15:14.872
- Yeah, yeah, I got
a problem with my truck.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.750
- Oh, trucks.
It's always something.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.502
- Yeah, I think it may be
the timing belt.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.671
Can't think of what else
it could be, so...

15:22.755 --> 15:24.673
- Yes, the timing belt.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.676
The timing belt...

15:27.760 --> 15:32.514
which links the camshaft...
to the crankshaft,

15:32.598 --> 15:35.809
which manages the pistons
of the engine.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.353
- Yeah, right, right, okay.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.104
Can you get somebody out here
right away, please?

15:39.188 --> 15:40.856
Herb Green. Amos knows me.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.859
- Oh, we're pretty booked
at the moment.

15:43.942 --> 15:47.196
There might be
an opening next week.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.907
- Next week? No. What are you--
are you kidding me?

15:49.990 --> 15:51.200
Are you new?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.494
I didn't know Amos
had any women there.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.413
- B-but yes. I am new.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.457
Love--I'm loving it here.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.335
Um, we'll be in touch.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.004
- Okay.
- We'll call you.

16:18.852 --> 16:21.021
- Are you okay, Bennett?

16:21.105 --> 16:22.147
- Yes.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.857
Yes, indeedy.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.623
- Hello.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.168
You're my interviewer?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.213
- Have a seat, Jasper.

16:47.005 --> 16:49.508
Could you remove your jacket?

16:49.591 --> 16:50.926
- Sure, yeah.

16:51.009 --> 16:54.263
Just wiggle out of that.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.433
Okay.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.226
- This goes over
your right index finger.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.728
Thank you.
- Right index--hey.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.146
- Do you have
any electronic devices

17:02.229 --> 17:04.440
anywhere on
or inside your body?

17:04.523 --> 17:05.774
- No, sir.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.614
- All right, ready to begin?

17:12.698 --> 17:13.866
- Yes, sir.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.868
- Question one.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.953
What do you think happens
after we die?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.080
- Wow.
Ha.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.958
Guess dive right in, huh?

17:23.041 --> 17:26.086
No small talk.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.631
- Hazel, come here!

17:29.715 --> 17:31.425
You gotta see this!

17:31.508 --> 17:32.760
- What is it?

17:32.843 --> 17:35.137
Oh, God. Is it, uh--

17:35.220 --> 17:36.680
Can you, like,
describe it to me?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.474
Is there--is there blood?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.350
- No, no, no.
It's nothing gross.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.186
Come here. Watch this. Watch.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.323
Okay, you see
how fast it swirled?

17:54.406 --> 17:55.657
It flushed right away.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.159
I didn't have to jiggle
the handle.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.535
I didn't have to do nothing.
Look, watch.

18:02.706 --> 18:03.999
I mean, I don't get it.

18:04.082 --> 18:06.418
It's like the plumbing fairy
paid us a visit.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.922
- Oh, yeah,
I tinkered with it last night.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.090
I must have, um--

18:12.174 --> 18:13.801
yeah, I guess I, well,
fixed it.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.511
- Wait, you did this?
- Yeah.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.679
- Well, then I don't know
what you're wasting your time

18:17.763 --> 18:19.139
at the bowling alley for,

18:19.223 --> 18:20.682
'cause maybe this
is your talent.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.185
It runs like a race car now.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.187
- Yeah,
I don't know what I did.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.731
- It was a happy accident.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.441
- I'll say. Yeah.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.944
We should look into
plumbing jobs for you.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.862
There's a lot of money there.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.115
Oh, this made my day.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.882
More romantic.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.389
- Should technology
for a post-human existence

19:00.472 --> 19:02.641
be available?
- Absolutely.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.767
- Do you believe
in the potential

19:03.851 --> 19:05.352
of a nonphysical reality?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.729
- Yes, yes. It's the future.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.481
- Any family
or romantic partners

19:09.565 --> 19:12.109
whose absence could cause
moderate to high stress?

19:13.485 --> 19:15.279
- No, no.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.990
I'm a lone wolf.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.500
- Okay. One more.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.503
Who was your celebrity crush
in high school?

19:32.921 --> 19:34.756
That is easy.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.091
Paula Abdul.

19:36.174 --> 19:39.303
Huh? Still is.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.513
- Okay,
that concludes that portion.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.348
On to the next.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.434
Here you'll find
nondisclosure agreements,

19:45.517 --> 19:47.144
identifications,
liability forms,

19:47.227 --> 19:49.021
the end-of-life agreement,
beneficiary documents--

19:49.104 --> 19:51.815
- Um, uh, end of life?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.776
- Correct.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.612
- Um...
- Hub employees will be

19:56.695 --> 19:59.531
the first to transmigrate
to Gogol's virtual biosphere.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.785
But in exchange
for immortality,

20:03.869 --> 20:06.455
your former identity
must cease to exist.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.625
- Oh.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.627
Oh. Great.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.425
- She's not allowed here.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.644
- Oh, that's trippy, right?

21:52.728 --> 21:54.980
I know we're underground,
but I-I-I can't

21:55.063 --> 21:58.066
quite convince my brain of it.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.276
Oh.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.238
Hey, what's in there?

22:25.510 --> 22:26.553
Yeah.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.638
Oh. Hey, excuse me.

22:28.722 --> 22:29.723
Oh.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.600
Can you show me how to--

22:31.683 --> 22:33.477
I'm trying to access this--

22:33.560 --> 22:34.936
Hello?

22:35.020 --> 22:37.022
Am I a ghost or something?

22:37.105 --> 22:39.274
Do you--do you people
not see me?

22:39.357 --> 22:42.152
I know that you know who I am.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.613
I am Hazel Gogol, and--and--

22:44.696 --> 22:47.783
and I am fucking allowed
to be down here now

22:47.866 --> 22:50.327
because I have--

22:50.410 --> 22:52.329
because I have this.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.414
Um, you.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.667
What is--what is your name?

22:57.751 --> 23:00.295
- Uh, W-William.

23:01.379 --> 23:02.798
Is that a severed finger?

23:02.881 --> 23:04.174
- Morning, everyone!

23:04.257 --> 23:06.301
all: Good morning!

23:06.384 --> 23:07.928
- You need to--

23:08.011 --> 23:09.721
you need to tell them that
I'm allowed to be down here

23:09.805 --> 23:11.056
and that they can talk to me

23:11.139 --> 23:12.516
like I'm a normal
fucking person, because--

23:12.599 --> 23:14.059
because they're all looking
at me like I'm--

23:14.142 --> 23:15.644
like I'm the bogeyman.
- Of course. Right.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.854
You're right.
I'll correct this immediately.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.565
Hi, my Gogol family!

23:20.649 --> 23:21.900
all: Good morning.

23:21.983 --> 23:24.945
I'm pleased to announce
that as of today,

23:25.028 --> 23:26.905
my brilliant,
brilliant wife, Hazel,

23:26.988 --> 23:29.324
is gonna take a more active
role in the Hub.

23:29.407 --> 23:33.829
So I authorize all Hub workers
to talk to her,

23:33.912 --> 23:35.247
interact with her,

23:35.330 --> 23:37.124
even show her
what you're working on.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.625
Would you like to say hello?

23:41.211 --> 23:42.087
- H-hello.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.296
all: Hello!

23:43.380 --> 23:45.090
- She has the key
to the kingdom.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.968
- I mean, I don't.
I have a rotting finger.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.220
- Thank you. Proceed.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.852
- What?

23:56.935 --> 23:59.271
I'm allowed to walk around.

23:59.354 --> 24:01.565
- Hazel, I'm actually
really happy you're down here.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.233
I would like
to show you something.

24:06.736 --> 24:07.863
- What is this?

24:10.115 --> 24:11.324
Where are we going?

24:11.408 --> 24:14.035
- Do you remember
the date we first met?

24:19.666 --> 24:22.419
- The day that I've regretted
the most in my life?

24:22.502 --> 24:23.879
Yeah, I remember.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.214
- Enter it.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.243
- What is this place?

24:56.161 --> 24:58.121
- My childhood roof.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.373
Greg Benson's roof.

25:01.541 --> 25:05.462
This is the place I would come
when I was a kid if I...

25:05.545 --> 25:07.339
needed to escape or hide.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.176
When I built the Hub,
I built this place

25:11.259 --> 25:13.511
as a reminder
of where I came from.

25:15.472 --> 25:18.308
The Hub has cameras
in every location except here.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.146
It's the only place in the Hub

25:23.230 --> 25:24.898
that nobody knows about
except me.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.402
It's my sanctuary.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.038
- Why did you bring me here?

25:44.209 --> 25:46.211
Because I'm giving it to you.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.964
I want you to feel safe.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.008
It's your turn to have
a place that's only yours.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.470
- You're never gonna
come in here?

25:55.553 --> 25:57.138
- No.

25:58.223 --> 26:02.644
- And you're okay with never
being in your sanctuary again?

26:04.479 --> 26:07.524
- I am. But...

26:08.692 --> 26:11.111
Maybe one day,
you'll invite me in again.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.334
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.878
- Good morning.
- What?

26:28.962 --> 26:30.338
What the hell?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.841
What'd you do, get up early
and make breakfast?

26:32.924 --> 26:35.385
- Yup.
- Okay.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.887
I know what's going on here.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.889
Yeah, spill it.
What do you want?

26:39.973 --> 26:41.599
- I can't just do
something nice for my dad

26:41.683 --> 26:43.935
and for my s-stepmom?

26:45.145 --> 26:47.564
- Yeah, no.
No, you want something, huh?

26:47.647 --> 26:49.107
Or you broke something.

26:49.190 --> 26:51.693
But wait a minute,
is the truck not working

26:51.776 --> 26:54.195
because of you?
- No. Dad, this is because--

26:54.279 --> 26:56.531
So I'm gonna make you
breakfast sometimes

26:56.614 --> 26:59.284
because you make me breakfast
sometimes.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.702
That's all this is.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.829
Okay? Come on.
- Yeah.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.541
- Eat.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.877
Your eggs are gonna get cold.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.962
- Okay.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.547
Okay.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.258
Hmm. Thank you!
- Yeah.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.892
- You know something,
don't you? Hmm?

27:25.226 --> 27:26.895
What's she up to?

27:30.065 --> 27:32.817
Are you in on it?

28:00.595 --> 28:02.639
- Hi, Byron.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.182
- Hi, Hazel.
