00:18.960 --> 00:21.925
So we have spanners, pliers...

00:21.960 --> 00:26.010
Ah! Now this, this is a wrench.
An adjustable wrench.

00:26.046 --> 00:28.699
Not to be confused with a socket wrench.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.805
I hope you're taking this all in!

00:38.320 --> 00:40.925
What the dickens?! He's here!

00:40.960 --> 00:42.925
Don't worry, the
meeting's not until five.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.361
Which is in precisely seven minutes!

00:45.397 --> 00:46.522
Plenty of time.

00:55.463 --> 00:57.328
I'm sure he won't be much longer.

00:57.364 --> 00:58.421
Archdeacon.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.736
So good to see you.

01:01.468 --> 01:02.648
Mmm.

01:06.522 --> 01:09.007
This is a momentous day, Mr Davenport.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.423
To commit yourself to a new parish

01:11.459 --> 01:14.208
is something that should
not be taken lightly.

01:14.244 --> 01:17.081
Oh, I don't take it lightly,
I can assure you of that.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.604
Mmm. It will be the
Bishop of Ely presiding.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.803
You may find him a little...
vague, at times.

01:25.295 --> 01:27.232
How old is he, exactly?

01:27.748 --> 01:29.969
No-one's ever been entirely sure.

01:33.313 --> 01:36.925
The institution service
is an important day

01:36.960 --> 01:38.333
in any clergyman's life.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.633
Being a parish priest
is a challenging role.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.268
And that demands structure and order.

01:48.842 --> 01:53.004
Sometimes these demands can
be stifling for the young.

01:53.788 --> 01:56.610
And you are young, Mr Davenport.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.020
So...

02:02.615 --> 02:05.158
It is my duty to ask.

02:07.076 --> 02:10.728
Are you certain that
this is your calling?

02:13.459 --> 02:16.189
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

02:18.318 --> 02:21.356
William, do you believe as far
as you know in your own heart

02:21.392 --> 02:23.925
that God has called you to serve here?

02:23.960 --> 02:25.647
I believe that God has called me.

02:25.794 --> 02:27.925
And will you commit
yourself to the mission

02:27.960 --> 02:30.781
and the... erm...

02:32.545 --> 02:34.240
- Ministry of these people.
- What?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.472
- Ministry of these people.
- Oh, yes.

02:36.781 --> 02:40.954
...and the ministry of these people
to further the kingdom of God?

02:40.990 --> 02:42.692
With the help of God, I will.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.550
What did the doctor say?

02:48.586 --> 02:50.925
He won't give me a note
for another week so...

02:51.311 --> 02:53.456
I still don't really understand
what's wrong with you.

02:53.492 --> 02:55.136
It's my nerves, apparently.

02:55.678 --> 02:57.180
Did you tell him you had four kids?

02:57.960 --> 02:59.532
I thought you loved your job?

02:59.960 --> 03:01.084
Oh, I do.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.244
So why are you letting
your silly nerves stop you?

03:04.459 --> 03:06.424
Thank you all for being here.

03:06.638 --> 03:09.511
I want you to know that
my door is always open.

03:09.653 --> 03:11.285
Whether you want to talk about God

03:11.668 --> 03:14.925
or the trials of being a
Cambridge United supporter.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.091
I can't promise to have all the answers

03:18.127 --> 03:20.333
but I will have tea
and homemade cake so...

03:21.177 --> 03:23.237
I only ask one thing of you.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.445
Please, call me Will.

03:47.121 --> 03:48.125
Bollocks.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.598
All right. Double or quits.

03:51.639 --> 03:53.604
Mm. I thought you weren't a betting man.

03:54.077 --> 03:56.490
Absolutely not. It's a disgusting habit.

03:58.797 --> 04:00.414
- How many times, Larry?
- Knock first.

04:00.450 --> 04:01.551
Knock first.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.925
These are highly confidential cases
we're discussing here.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.060
Sorry, guv, it's just we've got
a tiny bit of a... situation.

04:12.470 --> 04:14.172
He just walked in off the street.

04:17.445 --> 04:18.716
What's your name, son?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.195
I asked him that.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.385
Where's your mum and dad?

04:28.960 --> 04:30.143
I asked him that, too.

04:44.078 --> 04:45.715
Can you tell me where you live?

04:47.250 --> 04:49.751
Oi! Answer the officer.

04:56.995 --> 04:58.372
The blood's not his.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.183
Someone's been rough
with the poor little sod.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.597
Stick him in a cell for a bit.

05:05.474 --> 05:06.664
That should sort him out.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.332
- You shouldn't be making tea!
- Why not?!

05:21.368 --> 05:23.033
You're the parish priest now!

05:23.069 --> 05:25.676
I'm not sure how that renders me
incapable of boiling the kettle.

05:26.102 --> 05:28.535
The appropriate place
to attend to guests

05:28.571 --> 05:30.577
is the sitting room not the kitchen!

05:30.613 --> 05:33.695
- What will people think?
- I don't think anyone cares, Mrs C.

05:33.731 --> 05:36.659
I care. They'll see my dishcloths!

05:37.811 --> 05:41.578
'Call me Will.' You've
opened a Pandora's box now.

05:41.614 --> 05:43.815
I know. Wonderful, isn't it?

05:45.725 --> 05:47.382
How are you? Good to see you.

05:47.418 --> 05:50.213
Excuse me, ladies. Just
need to drag the vicar away.

05:50.249 --> 05:51.246
Sorry.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.430
- You don't need to thank me.
- For what?

05:59.127 --> 06:00.205
For saving you.

06:00.241 --> 06:02.323
LAUGHS I didn't need saving.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.370
Sow your oats before you settle down?

06:05.376 --> 06:06.462
Don't blame you.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.805
There's only one relationship I'm
interested in and that's with...

06:13.681 --> 06:15.264
It's changed a bit
since I was last here.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.521
I'm sorry. I won't be able to help.

06:18.583 --> 06:21.299
- I didn't ask for your help.
- Ah, you were about to.

06:21.451 --> 06:25.797
Look. The only lead I have on
a case is of a biblical nature.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.925
And you are the only man of God I know.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.131
You know Leonard.

06:30.338 --> 06:32.427
The only man of God
with common sense then.

06:33.287 --> 06:34.612
Look, you've seen the house.

06:34.648 --> 06:36.618
And I've got my sermon to prepare for.

06:36.787 --> 06:39.633
You have my sympathy. I know
Sidney struggled writing those.

06:39.669 --> 06:41.925
Oh, no, I've got three written
down and I'm ready to go.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.850
Just choosing which one
is the tricky part.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.271
Best get back to my guests.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.907
I just need you to take a
look at a page in the Bible.

06:49.943 --> 06:53.387
I'm really not sure if Mr Davenport
has a lady friend.

06:53.423 --> 06:54.742
You'll have to ask him yourself.

06:54.850 --> 06:58.315
I know how this works, Geordie.
You reel me in and next thing I know

06:58.351 --> 07:01.256
I'll be down at the police station
doing your job instead of mine.

07:01.292 --> 07:02.663
I'm needed here.

07:03.100 --> 07:07.100
Sitting in my office is a young boy
covered in someone else's blood.

07:09.584 --> 07:11.284
He's refusing to speak.

07:12.183 --> 07:14.336
Surely there's no
greater need than that.

07:32.568 --> 07:36.317
"And henceforth I shall be
five in one house divided,

07:36.667 --> 07:39.186
three against two
and two against three."

07:41.749 --> 07:43.633
I never was any good at maths.

07:44.372 --> 07:46.149
"The father shall be divided
against the son

07:46.185 --> 07:49.460
and the son against the father.
Mother against the daughter."

07:51.170 --> 07:53.169
That doesn't sound very Christian.

07:54.409 --> 07:57.534
It means hold fast to your belief
no matter what people think.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.527
Even members of your own family.

08:01.491 --> 08:03.961
- Who's your family?
- I've asked him that.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.328
Are you in trouble
with your mum and dad?

08:06.364 --> 08:07.711
I asked him that as well.

08:07.867 --> 08:10.206
He'll be in all kinds of trouble
when I'm done with him.

08:10.436 --> 08:12.636
Talk, you insolent bastard!

08:14.960 --> 08:17.537
How about we take a break from
all these boring questions, eh?

08:21.584 --> 08:23.425
You and your bloody vicars.

08:24.888 --> 08:25.977
Bollocks.

08:33.284 --> 08:35.664
Your name what?

08:44.960 --> 08:46.082
It's Adam.

08:48.405 --> 08:49.576
Where does he live?

08:50.960 --> 08:52.973
Home where?

08:57.245 --> 09:03.866
My name... Will... Davenport.

09:05.070 --> 09:09.755
Your name... Adam... what?

09:15.616 --> 09:18.385
Carter. His name's Adam Carter.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.925
- Hello, Maureen!
- Oh, hello!

09:34.428 --> 09:38.265
- Hiya, Claire. New hair?
- Oh, yes!

09:38.301 --> 09:41.090
Mrs Keating. How are we?

09:41.126 --> 09:43.107
Oh, much better. Thank you, Mr Draper.

09:43.143 --> 09:46.925
My wife suffers terribly with
her nerves. Awful business.

09:47.354 --> 09:50.125
Well, I'm back now
and I'm raring to go so...

09:50.381 --> 09:52.392
We've been at a loss without you.

09:52.522 --> 09:55.042
- A desert without its rose.
- Aww.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.186
Welcome back.

10:36.311 --> 10:37.726
You're home.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.520
God is our refuge and strength.

10:54.258 --> 10:56.465
An ever-present help in trouble.

10:57.897 --> 10:59.862
We will not fear though
the earth give way

10:59.898 --> 11:01.865
and the mountains fall
into the heart of the sea.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.305
- Hannah.
- Sorry, Father.

11:07.310 --> 11:08.957
We will not crumble...

11:14.960 --> 11:16.097
Mr Carter?

11:17.562 --> 11:21.042
I'm Inspector Keating. Is this your son?

11:24.874 --> 11:25.892
Get out.

11:26.714 --> 11:28.139
Get him out.

11:28.175 --> 11:29.918
- Mr Carter...
- I don't wanna see him.

11:30.522 --> 11:32.521
I don't wanna look on him.
It's his fault.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.784
He killed her. Your own mother.

11:36.820 --> 11:41.480
It's your fault! It's your fault!

11:55.869 --> 11:56.881
Oh, God...

11:56.917 --> 11:59.225
A sudden death at home
has to be investigated.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.225
- It's the law.
- Your laws, not ours.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.016
The law's the law, Mr Carter.

12:07.142 --> 12:08.355
You're Mennonite?

12:09.676 --> 12:11.225
The quicker you answer his questions

12:11.260 --> 12:12.910
the quicker we can leave you in peace.

12:14.381 --> 12:16.321
She fell from the hay loft.

12:17.632 --> 12:19.632
The boy went up,
knowing he wasn't allowed.

12:22.249 --> 12:24.095
And your wife went up to find him?

12:25.876 --> 12:27.229
Are these hers?

12:28.783 --> 12:30.419
Did you find the other
part of this lens?

12:30.455 --> 12:33.091
She must have offended God somehow.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.139
To be punished with such
a black-hearted son.

12:36.175 --> 12:37.845
He's a child, Mr Carter.

12:37.881 --> 12:39.594
My wife is dead.

12:41.483 --> 12:43.222
And he'll be punished for it.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.515
By God and by me.

12:46.550 --> 12:47.675
This is no time for punishment.

12:47.710 --> 12:49.675
Let's just concentrate on
this hay loft, shall we?

12:49.710 --> 12:53.409
This is my house, my rules
and he will be disciplined.

12:53.445 --> 12:55.845
I've seen how you mete
out discipline, Mr Carter.

12:56.467 --> 12:58.810
My wife raised her children
according to scriptures.

12:59.802 --> 13:04.515
To be God-fearing and respectful.
How dare you question that!

13:04.550 --> 13:06.610
Mr Davenport, might I have a word?

13:18.281 --> 13:20.246
Right, the first rule
of an investigation...

13:20.282 --> 13:22.675
I'm a priest. I don't need to know
the rules of investigation.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.250
Don't aggravate a grieving family.

13:24.286 --> 13:27.618
- This is not the time to challenge him.
- The man is a disgrace.

13:27.654 --> 13:30.459
- I need him on-side.
- His views are totally unacceptable.

13:30.938 --> 13:33.394
Have you ever considered he might
think the same about you?

13:33.430 --> 13:34.513
He'd be wrong.

13:35.710 --> 13:37.792
- You're right? Is that it?
- No...

13:40.004 --> 13:42.969
Maybe you'd be best back
home with your three sermons.

13:43.005 --> 13:45.221
I'm not going until I know Adam is safe.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.305
Fine.

13:47.229 --> 13:49.153
But you leave this to me.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.983
Mennonites...

13:55.505 --> 13:57.834
The only law they answer to
is the kingdom of God.

13:58.766 --> 14:00.534
Your badge means nothing here.

14:03.046 --> 14:04.435
Bloody religion.

14:35.390 --> 14:36.617
Sorry about your mother.

14:38.341 --> 14:41.715
Thank you for returning Adam to us.

14:43.647 --> 14:44.941
I like your necklace.

14:45.867 --> 14:50.322
Adam makes them for me. He knows
how much I love wild flowers.

14:50.358 --> 14:52.714
Oh, well in that case...

14:58.802 --> 14:59.793
Oh!

15:00.604 --> 15:02.826
Red is the colour of the devil, Grandma.

15:03.075 --> 15:06.205
Red was your grandfather's favourite.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.386
I'm keeping them, Hannah.

15:39.342 --> 15:41.608
Flowers. How beautiful.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.324
It's time for Grandma's nap.

15:46.452 --> 15:50.315
I don't want to sleep. I want
to talk to this nice vicar.

15:58.410 --> 16:00.129
They don't trust me.

16:00.939 --> 16:04.271
Don't judge them for it.
It's how they were raised.

16:04.307 --> 16:08.598
- Oh. Beautiful.
- My Alfred found it by the river.

16:09.393 --> 16:11.187
The day he went off to war.

16:11.710 --> 16:15.358
He said it would protect me
and Ernest until he came home.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.428
But he never did come home.

16:21.366 --> 16:25.241
Blasted scratchy thing!

16:25.710 --> 16:28.675
You weren't born into this
way of life, Mrs Carter?

16:28.710 --> 16:31.710
Lord, no. Neither was my son.

16:35.088 --> 16:37.815
Adam... seems afraid.

16:38.616 --> 16:41.431
Of his father. Of coming home.

16:41.467 --> 16:42.452
Mmm.

16:45.710 --> 16:49.406
My grandmother is sick.
She needs to sleep.

17:01.155 --> 17:02.815
Is that really necessary?

17:05.169 --> 17:06.685
Father insists.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.675
I don't mean to pry or judge.

17:25.733 --> 17:28.175
You're different to the rest
of town then, aren't you?

17:30.101 --> 17:32.086
People fear what they don't understand.

17:32.623 --> 17:35.710
Race, religion... Rock and roll.

17:36.710 --> 17:40.070
- I've never heard rock and roll.
- Oh, you're missing a treat!

17:45.190 --> 17:49.475
Mother always said, "Resist the
devil and he will flee from you".

17:50.137 --> 17:55.463
Hmm. I prefer, "Oh, God,
my heart is steadfast.

17:55.499 --> 17:57.342
I will sing and give praise".

18:03.891 --> 18:06.257
Adam should be learning
sign language properly.

18:07.235 --> 18:08.874
I got a book once.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.425
There was no-one to teach us but...

18:13.332 --> 18:14.930
We tried to understand it.

18:17.126 --> 18:19.234
Mother found it and made Father burn it.

18:20.082 --> 18:22.675
She said Adam had the
mark of the devil on him.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.025
You know that isn't true.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.425
She'd make him kneel in rock salt
when he prayed.

18:27.843 --> 18:30.134
So God would feel his
suffering and forgive him.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.864
God wouldn't want Adam to suffer.

18:33.888 --> 18:36.347
Mustn't we all suffer for
the sake of God's glory?

18:37.272 --> 18:38.792
Did your mother tell you that?

18:42.710 --> 18:46.010
I've tarried enough. I'm sorry.

18:55.109 --> 18:57.675
Adam's mother made him
kneel in rock salt.

18:57.710 --> 18:59.233
What kind of person does that?

19:00.089 --> 19:02.675
Some people have lives that
turn them sick and twisted.

19:02.710 --> 19:04.981
People are born with innate goodness.

19:05.017 --> 19:06.324
How they turn out is a choice.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.354
If you met some of the sorry
creatures I've come across

19:08.390 --> 19:11.044
and heard their stories
you might see things differently.

19:17.710 --> 19:19.329
From Miriam Carter's glasses.

19:19.831 --> 19:22.108
Surely that should be
down there where she fell?

19:29.490 --> 19:33.030
She didn't fall. She was pushed.

19:50.084 --> 19:51.814
Will seems to have settled in.

19:52.402 --> 19:53.531
Don't you think?

19:56.686 --> 19:59.065
Perhaps he'll be a breath of fresh air.

20:00.289 --> 20:02.254
If he ever makes a reappearance.

20:05.316 --> 20:06.520
What are you making?

20:07.319 --> 20:09.675
Victoria sponge? You do make the best.

20:14.489 --> 20:15.675
I was just saying how nice...

20:19.324 --> 20:20.675
I know you're upset.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.576
Upset?!

20:24.557 --> 20:26.576
"Strive to enter through the narrow gate

20:26.612 --> 20:30.675
for many will seek to enter in
and shall not be able."

20:31.890 --> 20:34.675
I might not get into heaven,
is that it?!

20:34.710 --> 20:36.754
There's no "might" about it.

20:37.710 --> 20:39.521
Won't you at least look at me?

20:58.910 --> 21:00.253
Hello.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.810
It's nice to see you back, Catherine.

21:06.537 --> 21:09.259
And looking more radiant than ever.

21:09.822 --> 21:13.515
Drink after work, perhaps?
Tom Collins, for old times' sake?

21:13.550 --> 21:15.098
Leave me alone, please.

21:17.049 --> 21:18.538
Leave me alone.

21:18.710 --> 21:22.379
Oh. I don't think you mean that.

21:25.864 --> 21:27.269
Let's...

21:29.165 --> 21:30.742
Let's have that drink soon.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.875
Changed your mind about going somewhere?

21:52.262 --> 21:54.519
They're linens. I have to store them.

21:55.042 --> 21:56.561
Does this belong to you?

21:57.349 --> 21:59.065
- No.
- It's mine.

21:59.999 --> 22:03.235
It was a present.
From one of the farmhands.

22:03.566 --> 22:05.116
Please don't tell Father.

22:05.152 --> 22:06.845
Were you in the hay loft
when your mother died?

22:06.881 --> 22:08.846
- No!
- What was your ribbon doing there?

22:08.913 --> 22:10.867
I don't know!

22:10.903 --> 22:13.675
Leave her! No, please!

22:13.886 --> 22:15.851
Put her down! Put her down!

22:15.887 --> 22:18.208
My wife must be buried here!

22:18.466 --> 22:21.531
- There needs to be a post-mortem.
- She must be laid to rest!

22:21.567 --> 22:22.899
- Mr Carter...
- This ain't right!

22:22.935 --> 22:24.856
Don't touch her! Don't touch her!

22:25.512 --> 22:27.195
Please, don't touch her!
Don't touch her!

22:27.230 --> 22:28.948
- Sister, what's wrong?
- Esther?

22:30.112 --> 22:31.884
It's all right, Esther. I'm here.

22:32.159 --> 22:33.859
Mr Carter, you're scaring your children.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.675
She wouldn't want this! She wouldn't
want to go with strangers!

22:36.710 --> 22:38.675
Go back to your room, boy! Now!

22:38.710 --> 22:40.293
She was murdered, Mr Carter.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.607
Your wife was murdered.

22:45.710 --> 22:47.927
So I'll need to take statements
from everyone.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.279
Including you.

23:07.658 --> 23:09.475
Mrs Bennett dropped by.

23:10.142 --> 23:11.957
She was devastated to have missed you.

23:11.993 --> 23:14.171
She baked you an apple strudel
and everything.

23:15.149 --> 23:17.475
To be honest it was a bit sour.

23:17.736 --> 23:20.505
I'm sorry. I got caught up.

23:21.757 --> 23:23.097
With Geordie?

23:25.510 --> 23:28.533
It's a strange thing, helping him.

23:29.317 --> 23:32.196
It felt like I was exactly
where God needed me to be.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.774
- Do you ever get that feeling?
- Rarely, if I'm honest.

23:38.002 --> 23:42.306
God and I have been moving in
rather different circles recently.

23:47.670 --> 23:50.801
Some girls brought them by for you.

23:51.416 --> 23:52.519
Very giggly.

23:54.220 --> 23:57.835
You know what they say...
Red is the colour of the devil.

23:58.126 --> 24:01.810
And those girls clearly had...
devilish things on their mind.

24:13.928 --> 24:16.176
Another? Or is that a stupid question?

24:16.212 --> 24:17.649
Pretty blood stupid.

24:21.510 --> 24:23.800
- Keating.
- Hannah is God-fearing.

24:23.836 --> 24:26.240
She's pious. She wouldn't have
accepted the red ribbon.

24:26.276 --> 24:28.945
To her red is the colour of the devil.

24:29.437 --> 24:31.933
- Rebellion, maybe?
- She's not the type.

24:32.312 --> 24:35.329
- <i>The younger sister...</i>
- Esther?

24:35.365 --> 24:36.689
She's a different story.

24:38.341 --> 24:39.734
I'll pick you up first thing.

24:44.241 --> 24:47.710
When I'm doing my questioning
you need to keep your trap shut.

24:47.746 --> 24:48.946
- I can do that.
- And if you forget...

24:48.982 --> 24:50.263
- I won't.
- I'll give you the look.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.366
The look?

24:54.743 --> 24:55.743
Got it.

25:12.889 --> 25:14.849
This isn't your ribbon, is it, Hannah?

25:15.573 --> 25:16.658
It's Esther's.

25:18.175 --> 25:19.643
Why did you lie?

25:20.947 --> 25:22.146
To protect her.

25:25.168 --> 25:26.510
Paul gave it to me.

25:28.216 --> 25:30.475
He's so funny and kind.

25:31.288 --> 25:33.059
He makes life worth living.

25:33.095 --> 25:35.129
Why was your ribbon in
the hay loft, Esther?

25:40.149 --> 25:42.113
Why was your ribbon in
the hay loft, Esther?

25:42.149 --> 25:44.368
- Were you up there when your mother died?
- No.

25:44.998 --> 25:46.825
I'll swear on the
Bible if you want me to.

25:46.861 --> 25:48.037
There's no need for that.

25:48.303 --> 25:49.670
I gave Adam the ribbon.

25:51.312 --> 25:54.170
- To remember me by.
- Where were you going?

25:54.874 --> 25:56.237
We were running away.

25:56.870 --> 25:58.718
She couldn't stand it any more.

25:59.510 --> 26:00.881
Then Mrs Carter...

26:04.084 --> 26:07.247
- We couldn't go, could we?
- Why were you running away?

26:07.283 --> 26:09.576
Esther's pregnant, isn't she?

26:10.663 --> 26:11.928
Sorry.

26:16.272 --> 26:18.166
Esther's pregnant, isn't she?

26:23.451 --> 26:24.911
She hasn't been well with it.

26:26.306 --> 26:28.028
It's knocked her for six.

26:29.510 --> 26:33.008
Her mother was many things
but she was no fool.

26:35.349 --> 26:36.517
She guessed.

26:38.510 --> 26:40.973
I was feeding the chickens
when she came at me.

26:41.959 --> 26:44.716
Told me I was damned to rot in hell.

26:47.197 --> 26:49.079
And all I could think was...

26:50.510 --> 26:54.007
Hell sounds like a blessed relief
compared to life with you.

26:58.002 --> 27:00.123
She was going to tell Father
there and then.

27:02.510 --> 27:04.968
She was so angry,
I feared to look at her.

27:07.444 --> 27:10.755
But the carts were leaving for
market and Father needed us to come.

27:11.124 --> 27:15.082
And when you returned home...
Your mother was dead.

27:19.310 --> 27:22.294
You would do anything to protect
Esther, wouldn't you, Paul?

27:26.107 --> 27:27.475
I'd die for that girl.

27:28.641 --> 27:30.310
Would you kill Mrs Carter?

27:33.230 --> 27:34.391
I hated her.

27:36.663 --> 27:38.895
The world's a better place
now she's gone.

27:40.343 --> 27:43.061
But... why would I kill her

27:43.990 --> 27:45.526
when we could have just run away?

27:47.718 --> 27:49.941
It's Mr Carter you should be talking to.

27:51.153 --> 27:52.135
Why?

27:52.396 --> 27:53.678
They were rowing.

27:54.510 --> 27:56.023
Screaming.

27:56.852 --> 27:58.467
He gave as good as he got.

27:59.650 --> 28:01.064
Can't say I blame him.

28:02.510 --> 28:06.475
You live with someone like her...
they grind you down.

28:06.910 --> 28:09.270
Reduce you to a speck of who you were.

28:12.310 --> 28:13.805
What was the row about?

28:16.663 --> 28:21.123
My... domestic discussions with my
wife have nothing to do with you.

28:21.710 --> 28:24.910
She was demanding you put your
mother in a nursing home.

28:27.586 --> 28:28.703
That right?

28:30.171 --> 28:32.826
- You think I'm weak.
- I didn't say that.

28:33.037 --> 28:35.109
I was in charge, not my wife.

28:35.908 --> 28:38.510
Did your wife undermine you, Mr Carter?

28:40.744 --> 28:42.138
Belittle you?

28:43.858 --> 28:46.820
There's only one person to blame
for Miriam's death and that's Adam.

28:47.510 --> 28:50.649
Full of all subtlety and all mischief,

28:50.685 --> 28:53.264
thou child of the devil, thou
enemy of all righteousness!

28:53.300 --> 28:56.475
You will answer
Inspector Keating's questions

28:56.510 --> 28:58.970
or we will drag you kicking and
screaming down to the station

28:59.006 --> 29:01.475
and every person in the town
will know you're under suspicion

29:01.510 --> 29:05.510
for killing your wife,
you woeful excuse for a father!

29:25.718 --> 29:27.358
Thought you were going to knock him out.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.547
Tempting.

29:31.510 --> 29:33.259
From a man of God as well!

29:37.715 --> 29:40.675
Whatever Carter says the man was
clearly terrified of his wife.

29:41.493 --> 29:43.253
She sounds like a piece of work.

29:43.510 --> 29:45.510
- Gives him a motive.
- Mm-hm.

29:46.681 --> 29:48.078
They all have motive.

29:53.048 --> 29:54.623
Esther's argument with her mother.

29:55.510 --> 29:57.219
She said it was here
by the chicken coop.

29:59.410 --> 30:00.710
It doesn't make sense.

30:05.510 --> 30:08.475
You said you were arguing with
your mother by the chicken coop

30:08.510 --> 30:10.813
when your father called you
from the courtyard.

30:12.017 --> 30:14.092
You can't see the courtyard
from the chicken coop.

30:14.967 --> 30:18.493
- Why lie, Esther?
- I told her to.

30:19.217 --> 30:22.283
- Hannah, you wouldn't advocate lying.
- I was afraid.

30:23.510 --> 30:26.181
- I didn't want her to incriminate someone.
- Who?

30:29.925 --> 30:31.010
Adam.

30:31.361 --> 30:35.283
You whore! You've brought shame on us!

30:35.431 --> 30:37.510
You've brought shame on God!

30:37.546 --> 30:41.157
Miriam, please!
Just listen to the child!

30:45.008 --> 30:47.708
<i>He used to be ever so meek
when she raged.</i>

30:48.510 --> 30:50.203
<i>But she was getting worse.</i>

30:50.986 --> 30:52.414
<i>And this time...</i>

30:54.811 --> 30:57.639
<i>I've never seen so much hate
in my brother's eyes.</i>

30:59.275 --> 31:01.943
Adam ran but she wouldn't leave him be.

31:02.646 --> 31:04.475
We knew she'd punish him.

31:04.939 --> 31:08.169
- But the carts were leaving and...
- We should have stayed, Hannah!

31:08.510 --> 31:10.026
Why didn't we stay?

31:12.656 --> 31:15.374
When we returned from the market
Adam was holding her.

31:19.870 --> 31:22.692
I don't know much sign language
but I knew that one.

31:27.649 --> 31:28.870
What was it?

31:31.555 --> 31:32.761
"I'm sorry."

31:53.987 --> 31:55.987
Those were happy days, weren't they?

31:58.131 --> 32:00.896
I understand how difficult
this must be for you.

32:03.910 --> 32:05.910
Please, will you just look at me?

32:15.280 --> 32:19.123
You've forced me to make a very
difficult decision, Leonard.

32:20.094 --> 32:22.910
I make it with a heavy heart.

32:24.525 --> 32:25.705
What do you mean?

32:28.265 --> 32:29.853
What are you going to do?

32:41.689 --> 32:42.745
Come in!

32:49.681 --> 32:52.905
I'm sorry. I promised myself
I wouldn't get upset.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.725
Does anyone else know about this?

32:58.951 --> 33:00.104
No.

33:00.576 --> 33:03.416
Good. Best to keep it that way.

33:04.673 --> 33:10.354
Mrs Keating. You are a woman
of a... certain age

33:10.675 --> 33:12.842
who has lived a sheltered life.

33:13.345 --> 33:14.906
This is the real world.

33:16.533 --> 33:17.939
But... he was...

33:20.317 --> 33:21.945
...over familiar with me.

33:21.981 --> 33:25.071
Mr Hobbs is a man. You're a woman.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.759
Maybe you gave him the wrong idea.

33:29.291 --> 33:30.282
No.

33:30.584 --> 33:33.616
It sounds to me that you've
made it very clear to him

33:33.652 --> 33:35.332
that you're not interested any more.

33:35.933 --> 33:39.513
Any more?! I... I never was.

33:39.549 --> 33:41.514
That's the end of the matter then.

33:42.223 --> 33:44.062
Put it down to experience.

33:44.735 --> 33:48.855
Now, wipe your eyes,
there's a good girl.

33:49.760 --> 33:53.405
And get back to work.
I want to hear no more about this.

33:53.647 --> 33:56.161
I won't have Mr Hobbs' name besmirched

33:56.197 --> 33:59.197
because of some silly misunderstanding.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.969
Who did it?

34:30.760 --> 34:33.056
Pushed... who?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.219
Let's call it a day.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.871
We'll come back for him
first thing tomorrow.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.149
I haven't got the stomach for it now.

35:01.832 --> 35:03.248
What will happen to him?

35:03.760 --> 35:06.048
He'll await trial in a remand home.

35:07.326 --> 35:10.122
If he's found guilty he'll stay
there indefinitely.

35:12.760 --> 35:13.840
We failed him.

35:17.008 --> 35:18.950
Sometimes it's the way things go.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.031
You and your God can't
control everything.

35:58.068 --> 35:59.572
- Morning.
- Morning.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.235
- Morning, all.
- Morning.

36:04.501 --> 36:08.065
Breakfast finishes eight o'clock
sharp. Four minutes past.

36:09.403 --> 36:12.410
- I'll help you clear up.
- No, thank you. I can manage.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.650
Well, I'll leave you to it.

36:17.364 --> 36:21.065
You've clearly decided that police
business is no longer my remit so...

36:24.647 --> 36:26.812
- Is it always like this?!
- No.

36:27.357 --> 36:28.747
Must just be me then.

36:30.503 --> 36:31.502
Ready?

36:32.464 --> 36:34.777
- Not really.
- No, me neither.

36:35.873 --> 36:37.942
What if there was someone
with Adam in the hay loft?

36:37.978 --> 36:39.108
He confessed, Will.

36:39.144 --> 36:42.277
Out of fear, maybe! Fear alters people!

36:43.227 --> 36:44.883
They'll do anything to make it go away.

36:44.990 --> 36:46.662
You say that like you know.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.925
What is it with you?
One minute you're Mr Affable,

36:48.961 --> 36:51.125
the next you're like a
scowling bloody teenager.

36:51.499 --> 36:52.679
He was afraid.

36:53.342 --> 36:54.915
And no-one protected him.

36:56.667 --> 36:58.703
It's unfair. I know.

36:59.363 --> 37:01.441
I understand if you'd rather not come.

37:10.860 --> 37:11.925
Geordie!

37:12.464 --> 37:15.136
Geordie! That's why it happened.

37:15.172 --> 37:16.672
It's why she died.

37:16.708 --> 37:18.147
They were protecting him.

37:32.165 --> 37:34.130
I'd like you to go now, please.

37:34.522 --> 37:36.146
Haven't you asked enough of us?

37:36.516 --> 37:39.088
Not everyone was at the market
the morning your mother died.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.965
But Grandma's old! She's frail!

37:49.000 --> 37:50.925
No. She isn't.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.653
She's just treated that way.

37:53.647 --> 37:56.241
You'd had enough of being
contained and patronised.

37:57.171 --> 37:59.225
And if your son couldn't
control his wife...

38:00.530 --> 38:01.761
then you would.

38:01.797 --> 38:03.815
You've already denigrated our mother.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.603
Please leave the rest of us in peace.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.223
You did it for Adam.

38:13.960 --> 38:18.689
- Didn't you?
- I couldn't let her hurt him any more.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.371
Your husband said it would protect
you and the ones you love.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.660
He had no idea how right he was.

38:31.584 --> 38:34.549
Suppose she that I'm come
to give peace on Earth.

38:34.585 --> 38:36.550
I tell ye nay!

38:36.586 --> 38:38.294
But rather division.

38:40.670 --> 38:42.710
What is this vanity!

38:43.128 --> 38:44.580
Stop!

38:54.161 --> 38:57.023
I did it for the children, Ernest.

38:57.749 --> 39:01.102
- She was their mother.
- She hurt them!

39:03.276 --> 39:06.721
In God's name maybe
but it was still pain.

39:07.181 --> 39:09.088
It was still suffering, Ernest,

39:09.124 --> 39:11.616
and you stood by.

39:25.086 --> 39:26.774
You must be brave.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.638
I love you all so much.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.270
Remember that.

39:58.255 --> 39:59.829
I don't need your pity, sir.

40:00.068 --> 40:01.617
You don't have my pity.

40:03.221 --> 40:05.220
You judge me though and find me wanting.

40:05.357 --> 40:07.125
It's not my place to judge.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.283
Only God can do that.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.522
My mother taught me
the words of the Bible.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.399
They were good words then.

40:18.660 --> 40:20.960
- Kind words.
- They still are.

40:25.239 --> 40:27.295
There was a time when Miriam was kind.

40:29.366 --> 40:30.623
Her smile.

40:32.542 --> 40:34.161
God, her smile...

40:35.450 --> 40:36.714
Broke my heart.

40:38.860 --> 40:41.540
Life is a struggle for some.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.032
It can harden the softest of hearts.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.074
She became cruel.

40:49.634 --> 40:50.933
We both did.

40:51.269 --> 40:53.400
Then this is your chance to make amends.

40:53.787 --> 40:55.557
I don't know where to begin.

40:55.593 --> 40:57.256
Remember who you were.

40:57.749 --> 40:59.479
Remember who Miriam was.

40:59.936 --> 41:02.541
The girl whose smile broke your heart.

41:02.577 --> 41:09.542
I spent so long trying to contain
everything. To control it.

41:09.578 --> 41:12.338
If you accept life is out of
our hands and in God's...

41:13.760 --> 41:15.760
I think that's where real peace lies.

41:17.972 --> 41:19.542
I don't deserve your kindness.

41:19.843 --> 41:21.829
Everybody deserves kindness.

41:28.895 --> 41:30.119
I need to...

41:31.458 --> 41:35.325
I believe I have a right to know
what you're planning to do.

41:38.916 --> 41:40.720
This is my livelihood.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.166
My profession.

41:44.532 --> 41:45.956
It's my life.

41:51.606 --> 41:52.791
You're leaving.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.925
The shelves have been dusted,
I've bleached the sinks.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.587
There's a mutton pie in
the larder for your supper.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.473
Who will I talk with?

42:05.007 --> 42:06.184
Laugh with?

42:07.173 --> 42:08.372
Bicker with?

42:11.318 --> 42:13.744
And what will I do without... my friend?

42:38.155 --> 42:39.211
Cheers.

42:40.498 --> 42:43.463
Well, I'd like to say it's
been a pleasure but...

42:43.960 --> 42:46.293
I think interesting's
a better description.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.611
- Decided on which sermon yet?
- I am starting from scratch.

42:54.647 --> 42:57.147
- Why?
- They weren't good enough.

42:57.183 --> 43:00.115
They were too... structured.
Too ordered.

43:00.151 --> 43:01.925
Don't worry, nobody
listens to them anyway.

43:03.241 --> 43:04.479
I want to get it right.

43:06.760 --> 43:07.960
You will.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.488
Where did you learn sign language?

43:13.281 --> 43:15.193
There was a girl.

43:15.584 --> 43:18.449
- A long time ago.
- Always a girl.

43:18.485 --> 43:19.682
What was her name?

43:23.157 --> 43:26.159
You're a dark horse. Don't worry,
I'll get to the bottom of you.

43:26.282 --> 43:28.925
- You can try.
- Sorry to interrupt, ladies.

43:28.960 --> 43:32.160
- You're up, Geordie.
- See you again.

43:44.042 --> 43:47.608
- What?
- You and your bloody vicars!

43:54.647 --> 43:58.327
I've been deliberating over
what to say to you today.

43:59.117 --> 44:01.335
Worrying might be more accurate.

44:02.319 --> 44:06.284
And I thought it only fitting that
we should talk about fellowship.

44:07.224 --> 44:09.925
Most of you here are strangers to me.

44:10.545 --> 44:13.556
But in time I hope that
we can become friends.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.842
I hope that we can help
and guide each other.

44:19.702 --> 44:23.294
I'm going to need every bit as much
guidance, maybe even more than you.

44:25.380 --> 44:28.516
<i>In God's eyes,
fellowship is a form of love.</i>

44:32.000 --> 44:34.960
<i>As strong as the bond
between a parent and child.</i>

44:39.319 --> 44:41.578
<i>Fellowship is a constant.</i>

44:43.881 --> 44:45.093
<i>A comfort.</i>

44:49.491 --> 44:54.515
<i>A source of strength in a world
that can be complicated</i>

44:55.459 --> 44:56.616
<i>and frightening.</i>

44:59.409 --> 45:01.204
Two are better than one.

45:01.780 --> 45:05.264
For if they fall,
the one will lift up his fellow.

45:06.459 --> 45:09.925
And I hope in the days to come
that we can lift up each other.

45:10.128 --> 45:13.085
I'm here. I'm your friend.

45:14.053 --> 45:16.018
Particularly if there's cake involved!
