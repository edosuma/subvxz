00:37.329 --> 00:38.789
Do you hear that?

00:38.789 --> 00:40.082
What?

00:42.417 --> 00:43.877
Something outside.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.593
Martin?

00:57.266 --> 00:58.600
Who's out there?

01:15.158 --> 01:16.493
Martin?

01:18.287 --> 01:19.496
What's happening?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.166
- You don't hear that?
- Hear what?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.506
Who's there?

01:30.507 --> 01:31.508
Hello?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.343
I don't see anything.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.138
There's nothing out there, darling.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.350
You just miss him.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.487
We both do.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.865
Oh, Lisa.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.910
- I just--
- I know.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.998
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

03:25.998 --> 03:27.583
Sarah!

03:27.583 --> 03:31.128
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

03:31.128 --> 03:32.546
Sarah!

03:32.546 --> 03:35.007
- Nothing over here!
- No sign of her down the path.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.510
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

03:39.636 --> 03:41.305
Baby, can you hear me?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.183
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

03:44.850 --> 03:47.728
How much longer are you planning
on staying here?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.565
- What are you saying?
- What if we don't find her?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.692
Every minute we're here, we're exposed.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.694
We're not leaving without my daughter.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.529
No one's saying different.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.365
If you wanna go, fine. I'm staying.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.701
I don't think your daughter is here.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.247
What do you got?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.794
Someone took her.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.755
What do you mean, "someone took her"?

04:15.380 --> 04:17.257
Those are our footprints.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.550
These...

04:19.843 --> 04:22.513
Someone else was here
when we were down in the ravine.

04:23.555 --> 04:26.642
Looks like two army Humvees.

04:28.227 --> 04:31.647
And these big boot prints,
they're military issue.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.149
And then there's this.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.706
They grabbed her

04:50.332 --> 04:51.708
and left the way they came.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.503
You recognize those?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.464
Yeah.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.758
She loves the stars.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.017
<i>These new aliens aren't just deadlier.</i>

05:09.768 --> 05:12.271
<i>They're proliferating faster
than we can count.</i>

05:12.271 --> 05:15.357
The others attacked for territory--
tactical position--

05:15.983 --> 05:17.359
But these simply attack.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.988
- They're calling them "hunter-killers."
- <i>How imaginative.</i>

05:20.988 --> 05:23.282
I'm glad you can retain
your sense of humor,

05:23.282 --> 05:25.242
because we've made things worse than ever.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.994
<i>It's a war, Madam President.</i>

05:26.994 --> 05:29.121
We hit the enemy, they hit back.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.874
We just need to hit harder next time.

05:31.874 --> 05:35.169
These hunters are impervious
to everything.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.712
Fire doesn't kill them.

05:36.712 --> 05:41.925
Mortar, napalm, biological
and chemical weapons barely stop them.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.554
What he's trying to say is,
we don't know what to hit them with.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.764
They adapted. We'll adapt.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.433
Do it fast, Nikhil.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.311
I got in their head once.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.645
I can do it again,

05:54.479 --> 05:55.480
whatever it takes.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.482
Let's hope you're right, Miss Yamato.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.866
No more time limits.
No more monitoring her process.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.035
She's the only tool we have. We use her.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.828
She won't stop until she breaks.

06:11.330 --> 06:15.667
Stalingrad was the single deadliest battle
in the history of humankind.

06:15.667 --> 06:20.005
You chose that as your paradigm--
Your perfect victory.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.715
Two million people died in that battle.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.175
But it won the war.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.094
Whatever it takes, Maya.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.432
Whatever it takes!

06:57.167 --> 06:59.336
Luke, have some of this.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.308
We're going to find Sarah.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.062
We're going to get her back. I promise.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.356
If you need to let something out--

07:20.566 --> 07:22.150
If you need to say something,

07:23.360 --> 07:25.070
scream at me, cry,

07:26.446 --> 07:27.823
whatever you need...

07:29.408 --> 07:30.909
it's okay to let it out.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.621
Luke.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.419
Just... say something.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.302
It's okay to feel angry.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.222
It's okay to feel
whatever you're feeling right now.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.307
Stop.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.726
Stop talking to me like that,
like some kind of therapist.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.102
Luke.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.063
It's my fault.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.482
I should have stayed in the car.
We were safe in the car.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.402
It's my fault we were even there
to begin with.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.486
- It's my fault.
- No.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.572
- No, Luke. No.
- No, you don't understand!

08:16.163 --> 08:17.164
Ana.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.082
We need to talk.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.668
Rachel saw something last night.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.883
I was on guard duty last night.
It was pretty dead.

08:28.592 --> 08:32.638
Then a military convoy comes through--
Headed south on the freeway.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.683
Could be the same ones who took Sarah.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.899
According to Rachel,
convoy was headed this way.

08:43.899 --> 08:47.903
If you take I-90 to 25 South,
it leads directly to Camp Pierce.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.323
It's the only operational army base
in the area.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.451
We got chatter in the air
there's some new kind of alien,

08:54.451 --> 08:56.620
cutting off everything south of here.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.790
"Hunter-killers," they call them.
Say they're worse than the others.

08:59.790 --> 09:00.707
Worse?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.751
Maybe that's where the military was going.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.545
You mean she might be there?

09:04.545 --> 09:08.006
Yeah, with a whole new breed
of aliens standing in our way.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.341
What are you saying?

09:09.967 --> 09:14.847
- Is he saying you're not gonna help me?
- He's just... laying out the risks.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.139
Right, Hanley?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.227
What? What aren't you saying?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.271
Why would the military
go to all this trouble

09:22.271 --> 09:23.814
to snatch one little girl?

09:23.814 --> 09:25.232
It doesn't make any sense.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.026
- You think I'm hiding something?
- Are you hiding something?

09:28.026 --> 09:30.070
Let's just all take a break, okay?

09:48.297 --> 09:50.632
Look, if there's something
you need to tell me...

09:52.301 --> 09:53.552
now would be the time.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.143
I'm asking you to trust me.
I need to know that I can trust you too.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.481
Ana.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.694
Who are you?

10:18.911 --> 10:21.455
I'm a mother whose child is missing.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.084
A daughter whose parents are gone.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.215
A wife whose husband died.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.800
A husband I didn't even...

10:38.805 --> 10:40.516
Doesn't matter.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.685
None of it matters.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.355
They're gone.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.732
They're all gone.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.658
And I was supposed to protect them.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.413
I was supposed to protect her.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.209
And I failed.

11:10.254 --> 11:13.090
I left her in that car.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.676
It's my fault she's gone.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.137
- I blame myself.
- Ana.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.597
And I blame you.

11:22.683 --> 11:26.103
I told you--
I begged you to leave us behind.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.146
You promised me.

11:28.146 --> 11:31.733
You promised we were gonna be safe,
and I trusted you.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.242
Ana.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.998
You didn't answer my question.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.254
Who are you?

12:46.642 --> 12:48.727
You were gone longer than I thought.

12:48.727 --> 12:53.398
I was beginning to worry that, you know,
maybe you changed your mind.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.651
Military is looking for you.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.946
They're going house-to-house.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.243
And Wade's looking at me funny.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.828
I think he suspects I let you out.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.133
You're on the level about this notebook?

13:22.052 --> 13:23.345
I'm just asking.

13:23.929 --> 13:27.182
That whole thing about the kid
who could stop the aliens

13:27.182 --> 13:29.518
and see what they saw,
you weren't just fucking with me?

13:29.518 --> 13:31.937
You're starting
to have second thoughts, huh?

13:34.565 --> 13:36.567
- Why did you come here?
- I told you.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.527
Followed the notebook.

13:38.527 --> 13:42.072
So, you just drove
halfway across the country

13:42.072 --> 13:43.782
because of some kid's drawings.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.535
And you aided a fugitive
because of those drawings.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.378
What if... it's real?

13:58.463 --> 13:59.756
All of it.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.928
What if these drawings really came
from the aliens,

14:05.971 --> 14:07.848
but it doesn't make any difference?

14:07.848 --> 14:09.141
It'll make a difference.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.726
You don't know that.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.524
It matters.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.153
Okay?

14:36.460 --> 14:38.212
My dad was a lot like you.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.465
Fought in Iraq, the first one.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.551
And when he came home,
you couldn't talk to him either.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.640
He needed to believe it was all worth it.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.227
That it all meant something.

14:54.645 --> 14:58.482
It shook him to his core
if anyone ever asked the question, "why?"

15:00.400 --> 15:01.610
That book.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.782
That boy. He's your war now, isn't he?

15:11.745 --> 15:13.914
What did you think
you were gonna find here?

15:17.501 --> 15:18.710
Answers.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.719
You sure you know all the questions?

15:43.151 --> 15:44.528
Wait. Hold on.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.323
I've seen this before.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.289
I know where this is.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.716
How much further is this place?

16:06.216 --> 16:07.593
Few more miles.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.431
When did you say this kid got taken again?

16:12.431 --> 16:13.849
Early days.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.268
Before anyone knew what was going on.

16:18.270 --> 16:21.023
Felix just had his 19th birthday.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.986
And then more started disappearing.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.020
Crows usually circle like that?

17:03.899 --> 17:05.317
So what's that about then?

17:06.734 --> 17:07.903
I don't know.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.446
But scarecrow's that way.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.481
What is that?

17:46.525 --> 17:47.776
What's what?

17:48.944 --> 17:50.571
That noise.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.656
Where is it coming from?

17:58.161 --> 17:59.454
That sound.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.164
You can't hear it?

18:01.999 --> 18:03.292
I don't hear anything.

18:39.661 --> 18:40.913
Mitsuki?

18:46.668 --> 18:48.128
What's it been doing?

18:49.588 --> 18:50.964
The alien?

18:52.341 --> 18:53.342
Nothing.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.222
No change?

18:59.515 --> 19:02.100
No, not since the last time you went in.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.896
No monitor spikes. No Maydays.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.860
Are you okay?

19:13.362 --> 19:15.197
I can hear the alien speaking.

19:16.949 --> 19:19.618
I thought it wasn't communicating
since the hack.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.663
It started again. Or it never stopped.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.625
- And you know this because...
- Because I can hear it.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.419
It's like a low sound.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.672
A clicking inside my head.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.466
It's something I sense more than I hear,

19:35.467 --> 19:37.052
and it's coming from the alien.

19:37.052 --> 19:40.514
- How do you know it's from the alien?
- A feeling.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.059
I think my interactions
with it somehow connected us.

19:44.059 --> 19:47.104
We haven't detected any signals
or emissions from the alien

19:47.104 --> 19:48.897
since we destroyed the carrier ships.

19:48.897 --> 19:51.650
It's not on any frequency
we are monitoring,

19:52.234 --> 19:53.735
but I know it's speaking.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.989
It's hiding from us.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.448
We need to flush it out.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.783
You have a proposal?

20:03.161 --> 20:04.371
I want to provoke it.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.166
Provoke it
to the point where it shows itself.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.919
And how do you plan to provoke it?

20:12.462 --> 20:14.131
By causing it pain.

20:14.131 --> 20:16.884
What if you provoke it
to become more aggressive?

20:16.884 --> 20:19.636
What if that something up there
sends more killers?

20:19.636 --> 20:21.597
What if it makes everything worse again?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.559
What if it makes you worse?

20:31.648 --> 20:34.651
I'll need every piece of equipment
we have in the lab.

20:44.703 --> 20:49.499
<i>Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo.</i>

20:52.669 --> 20:59.635
<i>Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo. Wajo.</i>

21:10.896 --> 21:12.105
Hey.

21:16.527 --> 21:17.778
You okay?

21:19.863 --> 21:21.323
I thought it would stop.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.787
Mind if I sit?

21:49.518 --> 21:50.936
We're gonna find her.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.402
I never had any brothers or sisters.

22:02.573 --> 22:03.866
You two close?

22:06.577 --> 22:07.578
Were.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.707
We were a family.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.420
Yeah, I know what you mean.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.966
Dinners round the table, right?

22:24.344 --> 22:25.596
All those dinners.

22:28.599 --> 22:31.894
They were just-- just dinner.

22:34.980 --> 22:38.358
But I'd give anything
to have one dumb dinner like that.

22:39.985 --> 22:43.280
Just a normal nothing-dinner
with my folks.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.617
She annoyed me all the time.

22:46.617 --> 22:49.119
We used to get into fights
about everything.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.874
It all just feels so stupid now, you know?

22:55.209 --> 22:56.585
Yeah, I know.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.424
But it makes us appreciate what we have.

23:04.635 --> 23:05.886
And who we have.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.682
Your mom's pretty great.

23:13.519 --> 23:14.770
You don't know her.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.648
I feel like I do.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.693
I mean, a little.

23:24.071 --> 23:25.364
Like I know you.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.790
Can you keep a secret?

23:36.708 --> 23:37.793
Yeah.

23:38.502 --> 23:40.629
I know why they took Sarah.

23:43.215 --> 23:45.092
They want this thing we have...

23:49.304 --> 23:52.182
This thing my mom says we need
to keep secret.

23:52.182 --> 23:56.687
People wanted it, so we started running.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.691
We had to change our names.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.112
It's what's kept us alive.

24:13.912 --> 24:14.997
Hey!

24:16.373 --> 24:17.457
Sam, right?

24:23.881 --> 24:26.675
- Yeah?
- I was wondering if I could talk to you.

24:26.675 --> 24:27.926
Hey.

24:29.261 --> 24:31.388
Why are you talking to my son? Come here.

24:31.388 --> 24:34.183
Just had something
I wanted to get straight with him.

24:34.183 --> 24:37.227
If there's something you need
to get straight, talk to me, not him.

24:37.227 --> 24:40.105
Okay. Is your name really Ana Lewis?

24:40.939 --> 24:43.442
- Excuse me?
- Are you really Ana Lewis?

24:44.276 --> 24:45.611
Or is it Aneesha?

24:48.739 --> 24:50.032
It's true, right?

24:52.242 --> 24:53.493
Aneesha?

24:54.912 --> 24:56.580
And you're Luke.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.333
Is there a problem here?

24:59.917 --> 25:01.752
She's been lying to us.

25:01.752 --> 25:05.047
Her name's not Ana Lewis. It's Aneesha.

25:05.047 --> 25:07.341
Apparently,
she had some sort of alien object.

25:07.341 --> 25:09.343
Some sort of shard.

25:10.427 --> 25:14.097
- It's why the WDC came after us.
- Hanley.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.391
We saved your lives, and you lied to us.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.893
- Put us all in danger.
- Hanley!

25:17.893 --> 25:19.061
No!

25:19.061 --> 25:22.064
Everything we have here is built on trust.

25:22.064 --> 25:24.233
We got rules, and she broke them.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.068
She's not one of us.

25:30.197 --> 25:31.490
She didn't lie.

25:32.741 --> 25:34.952
- What?
- She told me.

25:37.913 --> 25:41.208
She told me everything. Day we found them.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.544
Told me her real name, the object, everything.

25:44.127 --> 25:47.172
- Figured it was safer not to tell anyone.
- If you knew...

25:47.172 --> 25:49.716
So if there's blame here,
it's on me, not her.

25:56.723 --> 25:57.933
I'm sorry.

25:59.351 --> 26:00.686
I put you in danger.

26:00.686 --> 26:02.020
I broke my word.

26:02.521 --> 26:05.065
It was wrong.
It should've been your choice.

26:06.859 --> 26:12.447
I can't promise you I won't fail again,
but I can promise that I will try.

26:14.283 --> 26:16.326
I will try really hard not to.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.454
This is what we do, remember?

26:20.956 --> 26:22.499
We protect the people who need protecting.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.711
- Even if their lies put us in danger?
- Even then.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.463
Especially then.

26:31.258 --> 26:34.011
If that don't sit right with you
or anyone here,

26:34.887 --> 26:36.180
free to go.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.472
Walk out the door.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.435
Take whatever provisions you want.

26:41.435 --> 26:42.728
But if you stay...

26:45.022 --> 26:47.649
we're gearing up at dawn
to go get this little girl.

27:07.085 --> 27:08.295
There it is.

27:35.364 --> 27:36.406
The angle.

27:37.866 --> 27:39.952
- What?
- It's from above.

27:45.123 --> 27:48.168
The angle of the scarecrow
is from above. See?

27:48.752 --> 27:50.671
So what do you think the birds are about?

27:50.671 --> 27:52.756
Maybe they've spotted prey?

27:52.756 --> 27:54.925
I think sometimes they'll circle
if there's food.

27:56.468 --> 27:57.678
Or danger.

28:38.218 --> 28:39.469
Hold that.

28:59.156 --> 29:00.490
This isn't military.

29:02.576 --> 29:04.036
Not police, neither.

29:05.329 --> 29:07.873
Might belong to Martin, Felix's dad.

29:07.873 --> 29:10.459
So what you think Martin was doing
in the middle of a field

29:10.459 --> 29:12.419
with a 12-gauge shotgun?

29:13.670 --> 29:15.130
Shooting at birds?

29:33.690 --> 29:34.983
The hell?

29:38.153 --> 29:39.905
It's coming from the house.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.700
Wait.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.099
Martin?

30:11.186 --> 30:12.479
Martin.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.943
Are you okay?

30:17.943 --> 30:19.111
Martin!

30:23.240 --> 30:24.700
Wajo.

30:34.668 --> 30:35.878
Wajo.

31:06.867 --> 31:08.076
What's all this?

31:09.578 --> 31:12.039
Electromagnets, mostly.

31:13.999 --> 31:17.961
Have you seen the birds above the ship?
Their flight pattern.

31:20.839 --> 31:22.299
Strange, yes?

31:23.634 --> 31:24.760
Yes.

31:28.013 --> 31:31.099
Birds are attuned
to our planet's magnetic field.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.435
It's like their GPS.

31:35.229 --> 31:38.398
I think the aliens
are connected to that field.

31:38.899 --> 31:43.070
That's why we've had the gravitational
effects on our weather, tides.

31:46.156 --> 31:51.036
If we disrupt the field,
it might affect the alien.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.540
Cause it distress.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.377
Ichiko.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.047
Ichiko?

32:03.632 --> 32:06.051
- What?
- I don't know.

32:06.677 --> 32:08.679
You never gave me a last name.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.391
You just said Ichiko
was your college roommate.

32:13.267 --> 32:14.518
Remember?

32:19.857 --> 32:21.733
If you came here to convince me to stop--

32:21.733 --> 32:23.610
I came here to see how you are.

32:26.572 --> 32:28.115
How are you?

32:30.450 --> 32:33.912
Angry? Guilty?
Is that what you want to hear?

32:33.912 --> 32:35.706
No, it's not.

32:41.587 --> 32:43.547
I wanna show you something.

32:43.547 --> 32:44.798
What is it?

32:44.798 --> 32:47.134
Something that could save your life.

32:57.769 --> 32:58.812
What?

33:00.063 --> 33:01.231
Where is it?

33:01.940 --> 33:03.525
All around you.

33:06.445 --> 33:07.821
Biologists used to think

33:07.821 --> 33:11.450
everything in the forest
was an individual organism,

33:11.450 --> 33:13.535
fighting for survival alone.

33:15.537 --> 33:16.872
But they were wrong.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.126
It's all interconnected.

33:23.962 --> 33:26.048
Everything's connected, Mitsuki.

33:27.508 --> 33:28.717
Even you.

33:30.594 --> 33:34.556
You may think you don't need my help,
but you do.

33:38.227 --> 33:39.394
I'll be watching.

33:40.354 --> 33:43.398
If I see your survival at risk,
I'm pulling you out.

34:18.225 --> 34:19.059
Ok.

34:21.103 --> 34:23.188
Let's see how you like this.

34:31.947 --> 34:33.072
Anything?

34:34.366 --> 34:36.784
RF is clean, nothing on gravitational.

34:36.784 --> 34:37.870
Spectrometer?

34:39.036 --> 34:41.248
- No response.
- Nothing here.

35:03.270 --> 35:04.563
Okay.

35:15.991 --> 35:17.159
Report. Report.

35:17.159 --> 35:18.452
We have an RF signal.

35:18.452 --> 35:20.204
Nothing else?

35:20.204 --> 35:21.455
<i>Just the RF.</i>

35:27.920 --> 35:29.880
Let's see if this does it.

35:43.393 --> 35:47.064
We have a microwave emission.
Seismograph's erratic,

35:47.564 --> 35:50.317
ambient temperature in the enclosure
is up five degrees.

35:50.317 --> 35:55.072
Record every vibration, squeak
and dust particle in there. Yeah?

36:08.001 --> 36:09.294
What the hell's happening?

36:10.587 --> 36:14.258
Mitsuki? Can you hear me?
Do you require extraction?

36:15.467 --> 36:20.055
<i>No. Do not extract. Repeat.
Do not extract.</i>

36:20.806 --> 36:22.391
This is amazing.

36:25.018 --> 36:27.229
Please stop!

36:27.229 --> 36:29.231
Please, it hurts!

36:29.231 --> 36:30.232
Stop!

36:31.024 --> 36:33.235
Please stop!

36:34.653 --> 36:36.321
Please, it hurts!

36:36.321 --> 36:37.823
Stop! It hurts!

36:38.574 --> 36:40.200
Please!

36:40.200 --> 36:42.160
Please, it hurts!

36:45.914 --> 36:47.916
What's happening in there?

36:49.668 --> 36:51.128
Stop!

36:51.295 --> 36:53.463
<i>Mitsuki? What are you doing?</i>

36:53.463 --> 36:55.549
Stop, it hurts!

36:55.549 --> 36:57.342
<i>What's happening?</i>

36:59.636 --> 37:01.722
Stop, Mitsuki, stop!

37:03.974 --> 37:05.893
Please, it hurts!

37:05.893 --> 37:07.269
Stop, it hurts!

37:13.108 --> 37:14.776
Martin, can you hear me?

37:16.278 --> 37:18.113
We're getting you help, okay?

37:21.116 --> 37:24.077
Martin, where's Lisa? She's not inside.

37:29.875 --> 37:30.876
Lisa.

37:30.876 --> 37:33.295
Yes, Lisa.

37:34.213 --> 37:36.298
Do you know where she is?

37:37.799 --> 37:39.009
She's gone.

37:40.177 --> 37:42.304
Gone where? What happened, Martin?

37:43.805 --> 37:46.892
They--

37:46.892 --> 37:49.228
It was a pull.

37:50.145 --> 37:51.438
It took...

37:52.105 --> 37:53.106
Up.

37:55.192 --> 37:56.193
Up?

37:59.780 --> 38:01.198
Up.

38:02.824 --> 38:06.745
I couldn't-- I-- I couldn't-- I-- I tried.

38:07.788 --> 38:08.789
They took her.

38:09.456 --> 38:12.376
- Up where?
- I tried. I tried.

38:13.377 --> 38:15.212
I got away.

38:16.839 --> 38:18.382
I left her.

38:20.801 --> 38:22.511
I left them.

38:24.096 --> 38:25.639
Who's "them"?

38:33.897 --> 38:35.399
Billy was there.

38:37.442 --> 38:39.444
What? Where?

38:43.782 --> 38:44.783
Up.

38:48.453 --> 38:51.540
Martin, what do you mean,
"Billy was there"?

38:51.540 --> 38:53.208
What are you talking about?

38:53.208 --> 38:54.543
Billy was where?

39:06.889 --> 39:08.557
Does your doc drive a truck?

39:10.767 --> 39:13.353
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

39:18.192 --> 39:19.443
Shit.

39:28.327 --> 39:29.536
Mr. Williams?

39:31.288 --> 39:34.166
Mr. Williams, we're here to help you.

39:39.338 --> 39:41.381
What are they gonna do with him?

39:42.174 --> 39:43.342
Watch your step.

40:14.498 --> 40:15.707
Hey, Rose.

40:17.292 --> 40:18.418
Rose!

40:20.754 --> 40:22.130
Who's Billy?

40:25.509 --> 40:26.510
What?

40:29.513 --> 40:31.139
I mean, he mentioned Billy.

40:37.938 --> 40:38.939
Who is he?

40:45.153 --> 40:47.114
Hey. Hey.

40:49.157 --> 40:50.158
Hey.

40:54.496 --> 40:57.791
It's okay. It's okay.

41:25.485 --> 41:26.695
Thank you.

41:30.490 --> 41:32.659
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

41:33.869 --> 41:36.163
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

41:38.665 --> 41:40.000
I understand.

41:43.212 --> 41:47.424
I'm going to try the trust thing.

41:49.092 --> 41:50.135
Really hard.

41:52.387 --> 41:53.972
I might be rusty though.

41:58.143 --> 41:59.728
Let's go get your daughter.

42:17.746 --> 42:20.707
You take the 9935 south.
And if you see it, just keep moving...

42:25.420 --> 42:26.797
Okay. Get ready to roll.

42:29.299 --> 42:31.009
It's not your fault.

42:32.052 --> 42:33.053
None of it.

42:35.514 --> 42:37.724
I really need you to believe that.

42:41.854 --> 42:43.939
We're going to get your sister back.

42:48.151 --> 42:49.403
Who do we have?

42:52.656 --> 42:53.907
Each other.

42:57.619 --> 42:59.538
- And all we need is--
- No.

43:01.039 --> 43:02.457
I was wrong.

43:09.965 --> 43:11.300
We need help.

43:31.570 --> 43:34.031
Who are you?

43:35.199 --> 43:36.533
You know who we are.

43:38.785 --> 43:40.787
We thank you.

43:41.246 --> 43:44.625
Who is we?

43:44.625 --> 43:46.543
<i>Mitsuki, what's happening in there?</i>

43:47.669 --> 43:50.339
- Why isn't she responding?
- Answer me.

43:50.339 --> 43:52.049
- What's she seeing?
- Who are you?

43:52.049 --> 43:53.800
- Who's she talking to?
- What do you want?

43:53.800 --> 43:56.303
I don't know but she is responding.

43:57.095 --> 44:00.516
- Do you understand why I'm here?
- Just not to us.

44:00.516 --> 44:03.060
I came here to stop the aliens.

44:03.268 --> 44:05.687
You came here because of how you hurt us.

44:06.188 --> 44:07.940
How you hurt me.

44:09.733 --> 44:11.068
What did you say?

44:15.239 --> 44:17.908
You remember our first time in Odawara?

44:17.908 --> 44:21.453
With the cherry blossoms,
you said they looked like...

44:21.453 --> 44:23.580
A sunset.

44:27.709 --> 44:29.461
What have you done with her?

44:31.922 --> 44:32.923
You're angry.

44:33.590 --> 44:36.260
We remember your temper.

44:40.973 --> 44:42.641
What do you want?

44:42.641 --> 44:46.770
We wish to know
why your species is in conflict with us.

44:46.770 --> 44:50.107
This planet is our home,

44:51.400 --> 44:53.318
and you're trying to destroy it.

44:54.570 --> 44:55.988
We don't understand.

44:56.280 --> 45:02.953
We can't just let you destroy us.

45:18.927 --> 45:22.431
Like you destroyed me?

45:31.315 --> 45:33.817
Hinata?

45:33.817 --> 45:36.486
- Did she just say...
- "Hinata."

45:37.029 --> 45:39.865
- It's time to pull her out.
- Mira.

45:40.616 --> 45:42.409
The signal's still holding.

45:44.286 --> 45:46.121
No one has ever gotten this close.

45:47.039 --> 45:50.042
Whatever she's doing, it's working.

45:52.377 --> 45:55.506
She's communicating with it.

45:58.425 --> 46:03.055
Is there... anything left of you?

46:07.351 --> 46:09.102
Really you?

46:11.021 --> 46:15.150
I heard you... playing...

46:17.319 --> 46:18.362
our song.

46:35.128 --> 46:37.798
Let me feel you...

46:55.399 --> 46:58.652
<i>Mitsuki, what are you doing?</i>

47:00.237 --> 47:01.738
Mitsuki, what are you doing?

47:01.738 --> 47:03.407
- We need to get her out.
- No.

47:34.855 --> 47:36.523
- What's happening?
- Holy shit.

47:36.523 --> 47:38.108
- Oh, my God!
- Get her back.

47:39.359 --> 47:41.069
Get her out!

48:04.426 --> 48:05.677
Get her out!

48:09.097 --> 48:11.058
- Get her out!
- It's not working!

48:14.853 --> 48:15.979
Hello?

48:17.523 --> 48:18.565
Is someone there?

48:20.067 --> 48:21.360
Can you hear me?

48:26.740 --> 48:27.991
Who's there?

48:30.494 --> 48:31.912
Jamila?

49:07.489 --> 49:08.532
Mitsuki.

49:12.494 --> 49:15.205
Mitsuki. Mitsuki.

49:19.418 --> 49:21.086
They're out there.
