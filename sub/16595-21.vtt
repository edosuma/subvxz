I gave her this.

all these years.

something to her.

Kyle, look,
I never met your mom,

18:43.221 --> 18:44.488
but if she's
anything like you,

18:44.523 --> 18:45.522
I'm sure she thought

18:45.557 --> 18:47.358
she was doing
the best she could.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.527
You think?

She bought this land
and brought this trailer here

19:06.912 --> 19:08.178

She didn't give this
to your brother.

I think she felt like
she owed you something.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.054
So it's not really
a bribe,

19:17.089 --> 19:18.689
but it's more like
an apology.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.692
Not a good one,
but, yeah.

19:21.727 --> 19:26.029
