WEBVTT

00:05.797 --> 00:08.800
[pop music playing]

00:24.482 --> 00:28.653
[man] <i> </i> All right, settle down, settle down.
Yes, I know. They're both great books.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.864
So, my question is:

00:32.365 --> 00:33.950
which one do you like better?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.202
<i>Catcher in the Rye,</i> for sure.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.996
Holden Caulfield's a pimp.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.330
-[class snickering]
-[man] No.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.166
Iceberg Slim is a pimp.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.753
Holden Caulfield is a spoiled rich kid
from the Upper East Side

00:44.836 --> 00:46.671
who goes to a fancy prep school.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.047
Sound familiar?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.007
[laughing]

00:49.090 --> 00:50.967
Uh, what about you, Mr. Anderson?

00:51.050 --> 00:53.720
Well, my dad's not
a billionaire Wall Street CEO,

00:53.803 --> 00:57.057
and if he is, he owes my mom a whole lot
of back child support.

00:57.140 --> 01:01.061
-[laughing]
-So I'm partial to <i> Lord of the Flies.</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:04.480
I don't think Holden Caulfield
would last a week on this island.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.693
He'd be running around like a little punk,
wishing for this nightmare to be over.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.071
-[laughing]
-Kind of like a substitute teacher.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.656
-Oh! Oh! Oh!
-[laughing]

01:13.740 --> 01:15.200
Well played, Max.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.701
You know, the good news is

01:16.785 --> 01:19.370
you have a very bright academic future
ahead of you.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.997
The bad news is,

01:21.081 --> 01:24.083
you're probably gonna be a virgin
till you're 35 years old.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.084
[laughing]

01:25.168 --> 01:26.586
[school bell rings]

01:26.669 --> 01:28.922
All right, class, that's a wrap.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.673
Anderson, out.

01:32.675 --> 01:33.760
[girl] Bye, Mr. Anderson.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.513
Bye, sweetheart, take it easy. Later, man.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.890
Saved by the bell, huh?

01:38.973 --> 01:40.391
Principal Mellon, hey.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.852
You definitely have a way
with the students, Rob.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.729
Kids, for some reason,
I connect with them.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.649
It's probably our love of Rihanna
and the occasional acne flare-up.

01:47.732 --> 01:51.694
Listen, Ms. James' stint in rehab
is gonna go a bit longer than expected...

01:51.778 --> 01:53.655
Okay, yeah, well, crack'll do that to you.

01:53.738 --> 01:56.407
I've got a full-time position.
Love to talk to about it--

01:56.491 --> 01:58.159
Let me stop you right there.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.661
I'm good for a couple days a week,

01:59.744 --> 02:02.122
but I can't commit
to anything more than that.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.499
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm getting married tomorrow.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.251
I have an Uber waiting outside,

02:06.334 --> 02:08.377
and I don't want
to mess up my five-star rating.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.336
-Think about it.
-Thank you.

02:18.930 --> 02:19.973
-[elevator bell dings]
-Baby, it's me.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.308
I don't know if you got my messages.
I'm in the terminal.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.018
-I'll see you soon. Whoa!
-Hey!

02:24.769 --> 02:26.688
[grunts] Oh! Excuse me.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.439
[grunts]

02:28.523 --> 02:31.526
Ah! [groans]

02:31.609 --> 02:32.485
God!

02:36.656 --> 02:38.283
Excuse me. Whoo!

02:38.366 --> 02:40.785
Hey. Hi. Rob Anderson.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.662
I'm on Flight 1492 to Charleston.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.665
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, sir.
The doors to that flight are closed.

02:45.748 --> 02:46.875
Well, can't you open them?

02:46.958 --> 02:50.086
I mean, it's doors, that's what they do.
They open and close. [laughs]

02:50.169 --> 02:51.421
I--

02:51.504 --> 02:52.964
[typing]

02:53.047 --> 02:55.550
Ah! I can get you
on a flight for tomorrow.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.636
No, no, no, I can't go tomorrow.
I need to be there today.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.013
I get married tomorrow.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.556
Oh.

03:02.223 --> 03:04.100
[typing]

03:04.601 --> 03:07.228
I am sorry, sir. Our last flight out today
is completely booked.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.438
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.400
Attention!

03:12.483 --> 03:14.319
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.862
My name is Rob Anderson.

03:15.945 --> 03:20.491
I'm willing to do unspeakably desperate
and nasty things

03:20.575 --> 03:23.328
for a plane ticket
on the next flight to Charleston.

03:23.995 --> 03:24.871
Anybody?

03:25.955 --> 03:27.123
[woman] How desperate?

03:31.085 --> 03:34.547
Um... Anything short of a felony.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.174
Oh.

03:36.674 --> 03:37.967
Well, do you have cash?

03:38.051 --> 03:41.804
No, but I do have
this first-generation iPhone.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.514
Oh...

03:43.598 --> 03:46.309
Well, you're not exactly dazzling me
with options here.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.603
I have been known
to be a pretty tender lover.

03:48.686 --> 03:52.523
Ooh. Well, I'm gonna need a sample
of your work.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.609
Okay.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.780
[crowd murmuring]

04:01.199 --> 04:02.575
-Hi, beautiful.
-Hi.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.035
-How was that?
-[chuckles]

04:04.577 --> 04:06.996
I got your messages.
We're on the next flight out.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.459
-Yes! See, that's why I'm marrying you.
-You are lucky you just got here.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.379
You know, I was really mad
about two glasses of wine ago.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.714
I have a very good excuse.
See, I was securing our financial future.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.385
[groans] You're late
because you were playing the lotto.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.512
Baby, you got to be in it to win it.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.475
Hey, I got you something.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.311
You know, at one point,

04:30.395 --> 04:32.981
you described that as a rainbow exploding
in your mouth.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.733
Now, there's a lot of different ways
I can go with that,

04:35.817 --> 04:37.860
but I'm just gonna stick to,
"They're yummy."

04:37.944 --> 04:39.445
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.074
Right now, I'm just happy you're here.
I had a really tough day.

04:43.157 --> 04:46.244
Oh, what happened? Did your daddy
buy some mom-and-pop company

04:46.327 --> 04:48.204
and has to fire everybody
so he ain't gonna make the wedding?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.914
-You wish.
-I do!

04:49.998 --> 04:51.541
No, I had to tell a six-year-old

04:51.666 --> 04:53.835
that she has a tumor in her stomach
and needs surgery.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.255
-Oh, babe, that's terrible.
-But she's gonna beat it for sure.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.173
Yeah, she's gonna beat it. You know why?

04:59.257 --> 05:01.217
'Cause she's got the best doctor
in New York City.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.345
Oh, scratch that.
She's got the best doctor in the galaxy.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.640
Assuming there are space doctors
out there on some undiscovered planet.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.934
Stop it. Wait, how was school?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.102
-It was good.
-Yeah?

05:11.185 --> 05:14.814
Yeah, I didn't save nobody's life,
but Mellon offered me a full-time gig.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.650
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.569
That's great, baby!

05:19.652 --> 05:21.446
You are an amazing teacher.

05:21.529 --> 05:24.365
Thank you.
What took us so long to do this?

05:24.449 --> 05:27.243
Uh, probably because it took you
seven years to ask.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.202
Hmm.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.455
You know, a part of me
thought you'd never propose.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.166
Well,
it's like my favorite Justin Bieber song.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.418
-"Never Say Never."
-Oh, yeah.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.670
Or my second favorite
Justin Bieber song...

05:38.504 --> 05:40.256
-"Sorry."
-That was a good one.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.341
[Rob chuckles]

06:14.957 --> 06:16.250
[gasps]

06:16.334 --> 06:20.088
-Would you look at the flowers!
-Yeah, it's nice.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.924
Oh, look at that one. It's beautiful.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.967
-Hey, my man!
-What's up?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.552
-Excuse me for one second.
-Oh, hi.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.262
-What's up, man?
-What's up, buddy?

06:28.346 --> 06:29.472
Hey, real quick,

06:29.555 --> 06:32.100
did you know your mother sang back up
for The Gap Band on the Humpin' Tour?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.769
Yeah, I think
she missed my birthday that year.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.730
-First of many.
-Robbie, baby! [chuckles]

06:37.814 --> 06:39.816
-Hey, Mama.
-Listen.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.859
I was just about to tell Benjamin

06:41.943 --> 06:45.655
about the time I was singing
with Rick James in 1984.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.492
It was a lot of cigarettes,
Johnnie Walker Black,

06:49.575 --> 06:50.910
and it involved a basement!

06:50.993 --> 06:53.162
[laughing]

06:53.246 --> 06:55.081
There's my beautiful baby girl.

06:55.164 --> 06:59.043
-Daddy, hi!
-Hi, baby. Oh.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.254
-Wow, you made it.
-Yes!

07:01.754 --> 07:03.714
-How are you, sir? Good--
-You're late.

07:06.008 --> 07:10.179
Yeah, we had a rough start.
But I think the worst part is behind us.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.933
What Rob didn't tell you
is that he got a job offer today.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.311
-Really?
-Larkin Prep wants him to teach full-time.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.605
Oh, now, that's nice.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.191
You're getting married,
working for the man,

07:22.275 --> 07:24.944
like a productive member of society.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.737
Yeah, but I didn't say I was gonna accept.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.823
You know, the hours, from eight to three,

07:28.906 --> 07:31.492
and then you have to stay behind
and grade papers.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.161
Sounds like backbreaking work.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.709
Rob is just so amazing with those kids.
They love him.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.503
I mean,
he is going to make a great father.

07:42.587 --> 07:46.382
[laughs]
And I cannot wait for the grandbabies.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.093
Maybe we'll just wait a while
for the kids.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.429
We'll just enjoy marriage, right?

07:52.096 --> 07:54.223
You ordered the wrong font
for the programs.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.767
I expect you to pick up the new ones
first thing tomorrow.

07:56.851 --> 08:00.521
Okay. It's not like I have
anything important to do, right?

08:00.605 --> 08:05.234
And, Rob, this is your wedding rehearsal.
You could at least wear a jacket.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.778
-It is a jacket.
-It's a sweater.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.448
Well,
it's kind of like a jacketed sweater.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.200
It's a "swacket."

08:12.283 --> 08:13.117
A swacket.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.661
Dad, uh, where is Vicky?

08:15.745 --> 08:18.789
Oh, she's checking you guys in
because Rob was so late.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.834
We're all just trying to make this
the perfect wedding for you.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.962
If only your mother were here.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.591
Dad, I know, but she is here. She's here.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.719
[phone ringing]

08:33.471 --> 08:34.554
Oh, I have to take this.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.308
An investor group is planning
a hostile takeover of my company,

08:38.392 --> 08:39.727
on this of all weekends.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.813
You kids start without me. Hello?

08:43.648 --> 08:45.441
What do you got? You're kidding me!

08:45.525 --> 08:47.652
Is he really gonna miss the rehearsal?

08:48.694 --> 08:51.572
It's okay.
I am the daughter of Reginald Swope.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.242
-I'm used to it. Hi!
-Hi.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.953
All right, loving family, let's rehearse.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.508
-[Rob] Thank God we are here.
-[Ben] Yes.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.928
Did I ever tell you that I love you,
but I hate your driving?

09:14.011 --> 09:16.013
-Why, 'cause I know how to drive?
-You're terrible.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.515
Yeah, whatever. I'm terrible.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.518
Did you hear Megan's dad going on and on
about the programs?

09:20.601 --> 09:22.728
Yes, and you need to tighten up, man,

09:22.812 --> 09:25.731
because it's my responsibility
to make sure you handle your business.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.233
What are you even talking about?

09:27.316 --> 09:29.277
It's a fact that the best man
has his pick

09:29.360 --> 09:30.945
of the single ladies at the wedding.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.655
I don't want you making me look bad.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.615
You don't need me.
You make yourself look bad.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.492
Look at that Afro.
It's not coming back the third time.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.578
You know what?
Just give me the ring. Come on.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.496
Oh, ring... Uh...

09:41.163 --> 09:42.540
Uh, must've packed it in the bag.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.627
Megan told me you skipped out
on dance lessons, okay.

09:46.711 --> 09:50.631
It's the first dance, man.
It means a lot to her, so lock it in.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.550
Do you know I'm a natural dancer?

09:52.633 --> 09:55.678
You know, my pop-lock is on fleek.
You know... Bah, bah!

09:55.761 --> 09:58.139
All right.
Listen, how are your vows looking?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.349
-I got 'em.
-Because you memorized 'em?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.518
-Oh, no. I'm gonna wing it.
-Come on.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.145
This is your wedding, man.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.148
You can't just go half-ass it
like you do everything else in life.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.649
Come on, you just can't do it...

10:08.733 --> 10:09.984
Here comes Vicky. How do I look?

10:10.693 --> 10:12.570
Like the Fat Albert kids went
to prep school.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.654
Do I look nervous?

10:13.738 --> 10:15.364
-Yeah, you look nervous.
-I do?

10:15.865 --> 10:18.242
Boys. Here are your keys.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.703
-And a porter will be out for your bags.
-Thank you.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.331
-Hey, Vicky.
-Hey.

10:23.873 --> 10:24.749
You look...

10:25.333 --> 10:27.835
So, what is your policy
on wedding party relations?

10:27.918 --> 10:29.920
Because I am so into that.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.339
That's wonderful.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.924
I would get more pleasure

I may be marrying up, okay?

Do you know of anyone else,
other than yourself,

21:56.690 --> 21:59.901
Sweetheart, the candles have burned out,
the doves escaped...

22:00.402 --> 22:05.032

is getting... unhealthy.

22:05.115 --> 22:07.200
Well, what are you saying?

22:07.284 --> 22:11.079
Rob wouldn't just run out on me.
Something terrible must've happened.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.333
-Well, maybe it's for the best.
-Are you serious?

22:14.416 --> 22:15.375
He could be dead!

22:15.459 --> 22:18.587
And that would be terrible,
but he'd want you to move on.

Look, sweetheart, I'm just saying
that you have so much to offer.

22:24.634 --> 22:28.096
Thousands, probably millions of people
could make you just as happy.

22:28.180 --> 22:32.476

is that you deserve better than this.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.440
Well, I didn't really learn it.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.734
I didn't think
it was terribly important at the time.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.954
I wish my daughter would see that.

You know, you're really protective
of your daughter.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.258

-Nothing?

43:56.342 --> 43:57.885

What?

44:00.721 --> 44:01.889
Someone...

44:02.514 --> 44:05.309
Someone abducted me
from my hotel room last night

44:05.392 --> 44:08.354
because they didn't wanna see me
at the wedding.

44:09.772 --> 44:12.608
Now, I'm just curious, Mr. Swope,

44:13.525 --> 44:15.069
what's your alibi?

44:16.111 --> 44:17.696
Let me see, Rob.

44:18.113 --> 44:22.451
If I wanted to end your relationship,
I probably would've done it

44:22.534 --> 44:25.496
before blowing my money
on a wedding we didn't even have!

44:28.374 --> 44:29.249
