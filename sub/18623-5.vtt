01:35.155 --> 01:37.275
You haven't thrown away
those jam jars, have you?

01:37.310 --> 01:39.435
I was collecting them
for the spring fair.

01:39.470 --> 01:40.955
No, they're under the sink.

01:42.475 --> 01:45.555
You've gotta fill them with
stuff for raffle prizes.

01:45.590 --> 01:47.395
What's wrong with the jam?
That's a good prize.

01:47.430 --> 01:49.400
Well, try telling that
to the PSA.

01:49.435 --> 01:52.155
There's a list of approved items.
It's on the fridge.

01:52.190 --> 01:55.000
- What like? iPhones?
- Yeah, probably.

01:55.035 --> 01:58.455
And remember, Sally's got
a play-date with Gertrude.

01:58.490 --> 02:01.875
Gertrude? Isn't that the cow
from the Magic Roundabout?

02:01.910 --> 02:04.075
No, that is Ermintrude.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.160
Ridiculous.

02:05.195 --> 02:07.455
Well, you did say you wanted
her to have more friends.

02:07.490 --> 02:09.715
Yeah, but I'd rather they
weren't Shakespeare characters,

02:09.750 --> 02:11.280
Greek goddesses or French wines.

02:11.315 --> 02:14.275
Fine. I'll tell Sauvignon's mother
we're cancelling, shall I?

02:14.310 --> 02:17.671
- You are joking?
- Maybe.

02:17.706 --> 02:19.120
How was your run?

02:19.155 --> 02:21.315
Yeah, it was fine.
It was weird though.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.280
Weird?
Why?

02:23.315 --> 02:26.800
Well, coming in just now, there
was a shoe on the pavement.

02:26.835 --> 02:31.155
- A shoe?
- Yeah, just one single black shoe.
Looks like it's been placed.

02:31.190 --> 02:33.400
It's not old!
It's like a brand-new shoe.

02:33.435 --> 02:36.360
Right...
You haven't seen my keys, have you?

02:36.395 --> 02:39.115
I put it up on the wall anyway,
see if anyone comes back for it.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.795
So odd.
What's the story behind it?

02:41.830 --> 02:44.400
Right, I am off.

02:44.435 --> 02:46.195
Make sure she brushes
her teeth, won't you?

02:46.230 --> 02:47.640
And if you get a chance,

02:47.675 --> 02:50.175
will you sneak a peek
in Gertrude's book bag?

02:50.210 --> 02:52.675
- Why?
- Just to see what she's reading.

02:52.710 --> 02:53.680
Seriously?

02:53.715 --> 02:55.640
- I don't want Sally falling behind.
- She's seven.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.075
She should be reading
Janet And Whatsit Have Two Mummies,

02:58.110 --> 02:59.475
or whatever they
read these days.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.075
Right, see you later!

03:01.110 --> 03:02.400
Yeah, OK.

03:02.435 --> 03:04.635
See if that shoe's still there
when you go by.

03:04.670 --> 03:06.092
Bye, Sally!

03:06.127 --> 03:07.515
Bye, Mummy!

03:44.795 --> 03:47.320
I'm so sorry I'm late.

03:47.355 --> 03:49.755
I had a conference call
with Bombay and it took ages

03:49.790 --> 03:51.280
to get everybody on the line.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.955
Better than watching fifty episodes of
Fifi And The Flowertots.

03:54.593 --> 03:57.400
- Is she still awake?
- No, she tried but she fell asleep

03:57.435 --> 04:00.875
- with the book in her hand, bless her.
- I feel awful now.

04:04.515 --> 04:05.800
What's this?

04:05.835 --> 04:08.440
- It's that shoe I was telling you about.
- What shoe?

04:08.475 --> 04:11.755
That shoe from this morning, I
told you it was outside the house.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.795
Well, what's it
doing on the table?

04:13.830 --> 04:15.120
I thought I'd bring it in.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.235
And put it there?
Well, you don't know where its been.

04:17.269 --> 04:18.600
It could be covered in dog shit.

04:18.635 --> 04:20.279
It's brand-new,
that's the whole point.

04:20.315 --> 04:24.035
Well, if it's brand-new,
don't put it on the table, it's bad luck.

04:27.115 --> 04:29.835
All right, I just didn't
want anyone stealing it.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.840
What, so you stole it?

04:30.875 --> 04:33.240
It just felt wrong
leaving it outside, that's all.

04:33.275 --> 04:37.395
Give it to the school for the spring fair
if you're that bothered.
You can put Tiffany earrings in it.

04:39.635 --> 04:41.595
This was nicer two hours ago.

04:41.630 --> 04:42.755
I'm sorry.

04:47.315 --> 04:50.995
I...
I spoke to Chris Hutchinson today.

04:52.075 --> 04:53.360
Oh, yeah?

04:54.575 --> 04:57.555
They're taking over that empty shop
next door to Planet Organic.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.355
He's looking for some new reps.

05:00.555 --> 05:01.755
Oh, right.

05:02.995 --> 05:07.435
Well, it's not a million miles away from
what you were doing at Fraser's, is it?

05:08.795 --> 05:11.760
Yeah, sounds good.
I'll... I'll drop him a line.

05:11.795 --> 05:15.715
I managed to sneak a look
in Gertrude's book bag by the way.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.475
Oh, yeah, what's she reading?

05:17.510 --> 05:20.275
Anna Karenina.
And it was in Russian.

05:21.595 --> 05:23.895
You know what,
I wouldn't be surprised.

05:23.930 --> 05:26.160
I spoke to her mother
the other day.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.715
You know that mean-faced one
with the bad breath?

05:28.750 --> 05:30.960
Jeez, she went on
and on and on

05:30.995 --> 05:32.760
about where
they were going on holiday.

05:32.795 --> 05:36.555
And I know she wanted me
to get to admit that we were going to

05:36.590 --> 05:39.995
Center Parcs again
and I was not going to rise to it.

05:40.030 --> 05:44.275
She went on and on
and on about bloody...

06:05.475 --> 06:09.075
What are you doing?
You mustn't do that! Give it here.

06:09.110 --> 06:10.520
I was giving Suzie a ride.

06:10.555 --> 06:12.200
This is not your property, Sally!

06:12.235 --> 06:14.115
- Whose is it then?
- Well, we don't know, do we?

06:14.150 --> 06:16.272
That's what Daddy's
trying to find out.

06:16.307 --> 06:18.395
Go to your room.
You can play in there.

06:21.395 --> 06:22.720
David?

06:22.755 --> 06:24.040
What's this?

06:24.075 --> 06:26.715
We've got to talk to Sally about
respecting other people's things.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.875
I found these stuck on the
lampposts down the street.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.715
I did twenty of them but the
printer ran out of ink.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.040
"Found: One black man's shoe."

06:32.075 --> 06:33.960
I know, I wasn't sure
about that either.

06:33.995 --> 06:37.715
Cos it could sound like we're saying
the shoe belongs to a black man.
It might do, we don't know,

06:37.750 --> 06:39.475
but do you think
we should change it?

06:39.510 --> 06:41.200
You've put our number on it.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.715
- Well, how else are they going to get in contact?
- Well, I don't want them to get in contact!

06:44.750 --> 06:47.155
I just don't like the idea
of our number being displayed

06:47.190 --> 06:49.120
up and down the street.

06:49.155 --> 06:52.395
- So what?
- Well, people can call us,
find out if we're in or out.

06:52.430 --> 06:53.680
I mean, burglars.

06:53.715 --> 06:55.440
You're making too
much out of this.

06:55.475 --> 06:57.195
You haven't even
put a picture on it, David.

06:57.230 --> 06:58.720
It's just a stupid drawing.

06:58.755 --> 07:02.195
Well, I'm not going to give away all the details,
am I? Or else anyone could claim it.

07:02.230 --> 07:05.235
They'll have to describe it
to me when they get in touch.

07:05.270 --> 07:09.120
It is a single
tramp's shoe that you f...

07:09.155 --> 07:11.520
That you found in the street.
Now just give it to Oxfam.

07:11.555 --> 07:15.555
They won't have it. They wouldn't
take those Angelina Ballerina videos.
Nothing wrong with them!

07:15.590 --> 07:18.395
Because they're videos!
People don't have video players any more!

07:18.430 --> 07:19.675
The library does!

07:27.515 --> 07:28.715
Is...?

07:37.275 --> 07:38.955
I'll get it.
No, you get it.

07:40.035 --> 07:43.275
Ask them exactly
whereabouts they lost it.

07:43.310 --> 07:45.035
And don't mention the size!

07:48.795 --> 07:49.835
Hello.

07:51.195 --> 07:52.515
Hello, Mum.

07:53.555 --> 07:56.835
Oh, yeah, did you?
Who'd you go with?

07:56.870 --> 08:01.475
- No, she's fine.
- Hurry up, people might be trying to get through.

08:01.510 --> 08:02.555
No, sorry.

08:29.115 --> 08:31.595
Daddy...
Come and see what Sally's got.

08:39.017 --> 08:43.075
This looks good.
Is it the one you wanted?

08:43.110 --> 08:44.355
What's his name?

08:57.195 --> 08:59.360
You take on a refurb like that,
you're always going to be

08:59.395 --> 09:02.115
looking at some time overspend,
so, yeah, we've not done too badly.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.835
And the footfall from Planet Organic's
going to be really good for us.

09:04.870 --> 09:06.915
All those yummy-mummies
and their yoga mats.

09:06.950 --> 09:10.000
Don't. I should go,
I just don't have the time.

09:10.035 --> 09:12.315
No, you don't need to do
that, you look smashing.

09:12.350 --> 09:13.840
There we go.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.880
You've already got drinks?

09:15.915 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, you just poured them out!

09:18.035 --> 09:21.715
- Dunno what I'm doing.
Trying to get you pissed!
- Hey, I'm not complaining.

09:21.745 --> 09:24.645
Anyway, come on.
Sit down.

09:24.695 --> 09:27.245
- What do you reckon?
- About what?

09:27.280 --> 09:29.555
Well, Lou said you might be ready
to jump back on the gravy train.

09:29.575 --> 09:31.475
Bit of part-time work.

09:32.315 --> 09:35.275
Oh, yeah, no. Sounds good...
But I am a bit busy at the moment.

09:35.990 --> 09:38.080
Other irons in the fire?

09:38.115 --> 09:40.155
Well, it's just I've got
a bit of a project on the go.

09:40.190 --> 09:43.635
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have, the shoe.

09:43.670 --> 09:44.692
David.

09:44.727 --> 09:45.861
What?

09:45.896 --> 09:47.185
Not now.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.440
What's this?

09:48.475 --> 09:51.080
- Well, about three weeks ago...
- More like three months ago.

09:51.115 --> 09:53.720
All right, well,
whenever it was.

09:53.755 --> 09:56.315
A few weeks ago I found
a shoe outside the house.

09:56.350 --> 09:59.412
It wasn't like a thrown
away discarded one.

09:59.447 --> 10:02.475
This was black, slip-on,
good quality leather.

10:02.510 --> 10:04.040
Hardly a mark on it.

10:04.075 --> 10:06.235
And you're trying to find
a retail outlet for them?

10:06.270 --> 10:08.515
You see them as a new range?

10:08.575 --> 10:10.681
No, no.
I just found a shoe.

10:10.716 --> 10:12.560
Someone lost a single shoe.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.795
Well, no, we don't know.
That's the whole point.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.600
We don't know what
happened, do we?

10:16.635 --> 10:19.915
Could be an accident, someone's
fallen over, the shoe's come off.

10:19.950 --> 10:22.192
Could be an older gentlemen
with Alzheimer's, say.

10:22.227 --> 10:24.400
He's gone for a wander,
doesn't know where he left it.

10:24.435 --> 10:27.515
Could be kids dressing up...
They've taken their dad's shoe out of the house.

10:27.550 --> 10:29.835
- Maybe penny for the Guy.
- What, in March?

10:34.715 --> 10:37.675
- Right, so it's a bit of a mystery.
- Exactly.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.155
Do you want to see it?

10:41.915 --> 10:44.815
- Yeah, if you like.
- Yeah, OK.
- David, don't.

10:44.850 --> 10:47.715
What? I'm just showing Chris...
He's intrigued.

10:54.595 --> 10:56.240
Have you moved it, Louise?

10:56.275 --> 10:58.115
It was under here.
Where is it?

10:59.955 --> 11:01.760
It's gone, David.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.795
No, I know its gone.
I can see it's gone. Where is it?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.035
I threw it away.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.035
You fucking what?

11:11.595 --> 11:14.120
I got rid of it.
I threw it in the bin!

11:14.155 --> 11:16.955
It was too much, you were
getting obsessed by it.

11:16.990 --> 11:19.835
- I'm not obsessed!
- Of course you are!

11:19.870 --> 11:21.600
He's created a website.

11:21.635 --> 11:24.040
He's been badgering the police
for CCTV footage.

11:24.075 --> 11:26.555
It's public spirited!
You know Mike Evans, don't you?

11:26.590 --> 11:27.800
It's insane!

11:27.835 --> 11:30.395
You can't go for more than
two minutes without banging on

11:30.430 --> 11:31.872
about a bloody shoe you found!

11:31.907 --> 11:33.771
- Course I can!
- You can't!

11:33.806 --> 11:35.600
All right, then, time me!

11:35.635 --> 11:37.680
Come on, Chris, time me!
Two minutes.

11:37.715 --> 11:39.655
- There's no need...
- No, she thinks I'm insane.

11:39.690 --> 11:41.560
No, I didn't say you're
insane, I said it's insane!

11:41.595 --> 11:44.195
We'll see who's making
an absolute mountain out of a molehill!

11:48.155 --> 11:49.880
Do it.

11:49.915 --> 11:51.675
Do it.
I want you to see this.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.595
OK...
Two minutes.

12:23.915 --> 12:26.275
You going away this
summer, Chris, or...?

12:26.310 --> 12:28.600
I might go and see
my mum in Hastings.

12:28.635 --> 12:30.875
I've got to be around
for the shop really, so...

12:30.910 --> 12:31.960
How long?

12:31.995 --> 12:35.035
- Just three or four days.
- No, I mean, how long?

12:35.070 --> 12:37.275
Thirty seconds.

12:46.675 --> 12:48.675
This is very cruel what you're doing,
you know.

12:48.710 --> 12:50.555
I don't mean it to be.

12:51.595 --> 12:53.315
I just want to help you, David.

12:57.635 --> 12:59.200
Which bin is it in?

12:59.235 --> 13:00.855
Well, that was barely a minute.

13:00.890 --> 13:02.475
- Which bin?!
- The green one!

13:14.515 --> 13:16.275
I'm so sorry about this, Chris.

13:16.310 --> 13:18.955
It's OK, Lou, no problem.

13:18.990 --> 13:20.672
You know he's...

13:20.707 --> 13:22.320
he's not been well.

13:22.355 --> 13:24.515
It's fine.
I understand.

13:25.675 --> 13:28.475
But you've been through
a lot too, you know.

13:32.515 --> 13:33.555
I can't.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.835
Here you go, Chris!
Sorry about that.

13:37.870 --> 13:39.600
Panic over.

13:39.635 --> 13:42.840
Now then, if you
saw that in the street,

13:42.875 --> 13:46.555
you wouldn't think it'd been thrown,
would you? You'd think it'd been lost.

13:46.590 --> 13:47.995
I see what you mean.

13:48.030 --> 13:49.195
Careful.

13:51.835 --> 13:56.595
So... You're just trying to find
the rightful owner. Like Cinderella.

13:56.630 --> 13:59.532
Exactly! We need to do
a proclamation throughout the land.

13:59.567 --> 14:02.435
Get the media involved.
Have celebrities talking about it.

14:02.470 --> 14:05.515
We need it trending on Twitter:
#TheLostShoe.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.035
You know what I mean though,
don't you, Chris?

14:12.070 --> 14:13.800
I'm not going mad.

14:13.835 --> 14:15.155
A pair of shoes, they...

14:16.595 --> 14:18.235
they deserve to be together.

14:19.475 --> 14:20.635
Have to be.

14:21.915 --> 14:23.035
How they belong.

14:24.395 --> 14:25.475
I understand.

14:27.235 --> 14:29.835
Let me have a word
with Laurence who does my PR.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.240
We'll see what we can do.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.715
Thank you.
Finally, somebody gets it!

14:41.835 --> 14:45.400
But look, you've offered a reward,
is that right?

14:45.435 --> 14:48.355
Yes. Yeah, I thought it would be
some incentive there for people

14:48.390 --> 14:50.320
to come forward, you know,
with any information.

14:50.355 --> 14:52.635
Well, listen if you've got any old shoes,
listen to David.

14:52.670 --> 14:55.252
If you've got any old shoes
lying around your garden,

14:55.287 --> 14:57.835
bring them to his place,
he'll turn them into hard cash!

14:57.870 --> 14:59.200
Well, no, no.

14:59.235 --> 15:02.195
The reward would be specifically for
the pairing of the shoe in question.

15:02.230 --> 15:03.680
I don't want time wasters.

15:03.715 --> 15:06.835
I could have done with you this morning, David.
I was sorting out my sock drawer.

15:06.870 --> 15:09.632
Anyway, look, we've had an e-mail
from Jacqueline in Barnet and she

15:09.667 --> 15:12.395
says, "Why don't you just
give the money to a homeless shelter?

15:12.430 --> 15:15.800
"Why are you concentrating
on this one shoe?"

15:15.835 --> 15:20.315
Jacqueline, someone somewhere
is missing a shoe and if I can bring

15:20.350 --> 15:24.795
that person and that shoe together,
then I will have achieved that.

15:24.830 --> 15:27.195
All, right, David.
Let's say this for a second, yeah.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.320
Say I'm the person
that lost that shoe.

15:29.355 --> 15:32.155
Now I go back to look for it,
but it's not there because you,

15:32.190 --> 15:33.435
you've got it in your house.

15:33.470 --> 15:34.675
Now what do I do?

15:35.995 --> 15:39.275
Well, as I say, it's all,
it's all on the website and...

15:41.315 --> 15:42.675
Stupid question.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.075
Daddy!

15:55.555 --> 15:57.955
You have no new messages.

16:21.635 --> 16:23.715
Hi, I've come about the shoe.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.040
Sorry?

16:25.075 --> 16:27.915
The missing shoe.
I think it's mine.

16:27.950 --> 16:30.755
Right, well,
you'd better come in.

16:34.355 --> 16:36.555
- Come through.
- Thanks.

16:38.683 --> 16:42.795
- Do you want to take a seat?
- No, you're all right, thanks.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.560
Yeah, so can I ask
how you heard about us?

16:45.595 --> 16:48.995
My wife heard you on the
radio, whenever that was.

16:49.030 --> 16:51.072
Right.
You live locally?

16:51.107 --> 16:53.080
No, we live up in Norfolk.

16:53.115 --> 16:55.200
We were down here for a wedding.

16:55.235 --> 16:58.475
The shoe must have fallen
out the bottom of my suit bag.

16:58.510 --> 17:01.555
We were parked just
out there by the tree.

17:01.590 --> 17:02.675
Right.

17:04.115 --> 17:05.474
Whose wedding was it?

17:06.515 --> 17:09.275
I don't think you'd know them.
What's that got to do with anything?

17:09.310 --> 17:12.200
Oh, nothing.
I'm just trying to get a full picture.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.875
OK, well, I'm going to ask
you a couple of questions.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.915
- I'm sure... I'm sure you understand.
- OK.

17:19.835 --> 17:23.435
What size was the shoe
you claim you lost?

17:25.474 --> 17:26.635
Nine.

17:28.035 --> 17:30.760
Correct.
Good start.

17:30.795 --> 17:34.235
Next, I'm going to show you
some photographs and I want you

17:34.270 --> 17:37.675
to tell me which one is the correct tread...
A, B, C or D?

17:55.155 --> 17:56.355
Can I see B again?

17:58.355 --> 18:01.635
Yeah.
There you go.

18:01.670 --> 18:03.035
Take your time.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.475
OK, I think it's C.

18:14.075 --> 18:15.275
C.

18:16.475 --> 18:18.795
And what colour are the laces?

18:20.235 --> 18:22.355
It didn't have laces,
it was a slip-on.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.555
Actually, I've got the other
one here if you need proof?

18:31.715 --> 18:33.235
Just let me...

18:35.395 --> 18:36.795
Yeah, it looks the same.

18:38.515 --> 18:40.040
Correct tread.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.835
And, what, it just fell out
of your suit carrier, you say?

18:43.376 --> 18:46.035
It can't have been
zipped up properly.

18:46.070 --> 18:47.355
Sounds plausible.

18:48.955 --> 18:50.595
Looks like we've got a match.

18:52.475 --> 18:53.675
Well done.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.920
Can I have it then?

19:01.955 --> 19:04.155
What, you want to take it now?

19:04.190 --> 19:07.555
That's what I'm here for.

19:07.590 --> 19:08.875
Right, yeah.

19:10.555 --> 19:12.995
Do you want a drink or anything?
Celebrate?

19:13.030 --> 19:15.435
No, I'd best get off.
My car's on a meter.

19:18.755 --> 19:19.915
OK.

19:39.835 --> 19:41.960
Here he is.

19:41.995 --> 19:43.955
I've looked after him.

19:45.995 --> 19:49.555
I... I won't make you try them on.
That'd be weird, wouldn't it?

19:49.590 --> 19:50.715
- Yes.
- Yeah.

19:57.355 --> 20:00.315
Could you just give me a minute, please?
I'm finding this really hard.

20:02.315 --> 20:04.040
Sure.

20:04.075 --> 20:05.320
Can I use your loo?

20:05.355 --> 20:07.675
Yes. It's just...
It's by the front door.

20:32.675 --> 20:34.355
All right?

20:34.390 --> 20:35.640
Yeah.

20:35.675 --> 20:36.955
Yeah, here you go.

20:38.595 --> 20:40.375
They're both in there.

20:40.410 --> 20:42.155
So that's that done now.

20:43.595 --> 20:45.995
Mission accomplished.

20:46.030 --> 20:47.635
Well, thank you.

20:54.798 --> 20:58.395
I need to get you some
money for the reward.

20:58.430 --> 21:00.235
No, I'm not bothered about that.

21:00.270 --> 21:01.915
I just wanted the shoe.

21:01.950 --> 21:04.600
- Thanks again.
- No, thank you.

21:04.635 --> 21:06.555
And you know where
we are now so...

21:14.155 --> 21:19.515
That's right, and autumn
has a silent "n" at the end

21:19.550 --> 21:22.955
like column or hymn.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.035
Who?

21:25.475 --> 21:27.715
No, like a hymn
that you sing in church.

21:29.035 --> 21:30.355
Like a funeral?

21:32.035 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.035 --> 21:37.635
Yeah, or a wedding
or the harvest festival.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.115
Where are my girls?

21:39.150 --> 21:44.075
- Daddy!
- Hello.

21:46.315 --> 21:48.240
Have you done an autumn picture?

21:48.275 --> 21:54.035
Yeah, look, there's falling leaves,
a bonfire and there's Mummy, look.

21:54.070 --> 21:55.160
It's a pumpkin.

21:55.195 --> 21:57.635
Cheeky! Go and put it
in your book bag, darling.

21:57.670 --> 21:59.235
You can take it in tomorrow.

22:01.915 --> 22:03.040
How was today?

22:03.075 --> 22:06.195
Fine, yeah, we got those...
tiles in from Italy and Chris says

22:06.230 --> 22:08.755
there might be a trip out there
in a couple of months.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.292
Very nice.

22:10.327 --> 22:11.760
Wives invited?

22:11.795 --> 22:13.835
Well, we'll have to see,
won't we?

22:15.155 --> 22:18.715
Daddy, can I show you my assembly?
I've got lines.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.400
Yes, go on!

22:20.435 --> 22:21.975
We're doing nursery rhymes.

22:22.010 --> 22:23.480
Darling, let Daddy get in.

22:23.515 --> 22:25.120
I'm going to make him
a cup of tea first.

22:25.155 --> 22:27.635
No, I don't mind. Go on, Sal.
I'll be the audience.

22:27.670 --> 22:29.680
Well, I'm here and Annabel's here,

22:29.715 --> 22:33.000
and Christian's here and he says,
"Diddle diddle dumpling,

22:33.035 --> 22:37.715
"my son, John," and Annabel says,
"Went to bed with his trousers on."

22:37.750 --> 22:41.195
And I say, "One shoe off and one shoe on,"
then we all say,

22:41.230 --> 22:43.515
"Diddle diddle dumpling,
my son, John."

22:47.395 --> 22:50.915
Encore! More!
Well done.

23:37.315 --> 23:39.440
David?

23:39.475 --> 23:41.040
What have you been doing?

23:41.075 --> 23:43.795
Well, I could ask you that,
Louise, couldn't I?

23:43.830 --> 23:46.472
What do you mean?
What's this doing outside?

23:46.507 --> 23:49.115
What do you think?
It's back where it belongs.

23:50.675 --> 23:52.200
What are you talking about?

23:52.235 --> 23:54.675
You said the owner came
and took it weeks ago.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.595
You said it was all sorted.

23:56.630 --> 23:57.795
Who's that?

23:59.075 --> 24:02.635
I don't know.
People from college?

24:02.670 --> 24:04.080
Your college?

24:04.115 --> 24:06.200
Yeah.
What is this?

24:06.235 --> 24:08.840
I was doing you
a photobook for your birthday.

24:08.875 --> 24:10.145
Thought it'd be a nice surprise.

24:10.165 --> 24:13.165
And I got all your old pictures out
and I found...

24:13.180 --> 24:15.345
Him...
Your friend.

24:15.395 --> 24:16.715
What's his name?

24:21.035 --> 24:22.160
Ted.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.475
It's Ted, is it?

24:25.355 --> 24:26.875
When did you last see Ted?

24:29.995 --> 24:31.240
Dunno, it was a while ago.

24:31.275 --> 24:33.715
Really? Cos I saw Ted six weeks ago
when he came round,

24:33.750 --> 24:35.355
pretended he owned the shoe.

24:37.795 --> 24:40.915
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, this'll really confuse you then.

24:40.950 --> 24:43.035
Cos after I found that picture,
I got your VAT file out,

24:43.070 --> 24:45.292
went through your
receipts and I found this.

24:45.327 --> 24:47.480
From Stead and Simpson:
Black slip-on, size 9.

24:47.515 --> 24:50.395
- Oh, David.
- Dated two days before Ted came to see me.

24:50.430 --> 24:52.155
How do you explain that?

24:58.115 --> 24:59.315
OK.

25:02.755 --> 25:04.235
He was doing me a favour.

25:05.955 --> 25:07.320
I was trying to help you.

25:07.355 --> 25:09.435
By lying to me?
By giving me false hope?

25:09.470 --> 25:11.235
Listen to yourself, David!

25:13.795 --> 25:15.920
I just wanted it to be over.

25:15.955 --> 25:21.235
Who cares?
Who cares who took the fucking stupid shoe?!

25:27.155 --> 25:28.875
It's not about the shoe, is it?

25:33.515 --> 25:35.235
It was never about the shoe.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.635
No.

25:39.395 --> 25:40.755
No, it isn't.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.915
And it's not healthy, David.

25:45.950 --> 25:47.275
For any of us.

25:51.395 --> 25:53.000
It's been six years.

25:53.266 --> 25:55.435
I'm sorry, is that
the time limit?

25:55.470 --> 25:56.680
Should I be over it now?

25:56.715 --> 26:00.755
No. No, that's not what I'm saying,
but we still have Sally.

26:00.790 --> 26:04.152
We... We have to live our lives,
for her sake.

26:04.187 --> 26:07.515
She doesn't even remember
having a brother.

26:07.550 --> 26:08.995
Not a brother...

26:10.875 --> 26:12.115
A twin.

26:14.075 --> 26:15.875
Two halves, Louise...

26:20.435 --> 26:22.755
and one of them's gone.

26:22.790 --> 26:23.835
Yeah, I know.

26:25.795 --> 26:31.475
And I understand now
what you're trying to do,

26:31.510 --> 26:33.355
but we can't do that, David...

26:37.875 --> 26:39.595
because Joseph is dead.

26:42.515 --> 26:44.115
He died.

26:47.515 --> 26:49.115
They should be together.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.435
David, you're bleeding.

27:00.915 --> 27:02.235
No, I'm not.

27:11.555 --> 27:13.315
Where did you get that shoe?

27:15.835 --> 27:17.075
I went to see Ted.

27:19.235 --> 27:21.875
- In Norfolk?
- Yes, in Norfolk.

27:23.395 --> 27:25.315
He didn't want to give me it.

27:27.315 --> 27:30.075
He said something about
me being unreasonable.

27:37.715 --> 27:39.195
What did you do?

27:42.275 --> 27:45.475
David, what did you do?

27:51.675 --> 27:53.075
I can't remember.
