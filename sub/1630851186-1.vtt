03:28.382 --> 03:29.731
-Rich!

03:30.775 --> 03:34.388
-Fixed! Fixed!

03:47.401 --> 03:49.054
-And here I am, wide awake.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.621
-And that's it, then,
for the night.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.624
What's that? Five hours,
and I'm just so tired.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.452
-We don't have enough
bamboo cakes for the poor table.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.019
Do you have some more?

03:57.019 --> 03:59.630
-The poor table needs cleaning.

03:59.630 --> 04:02.372
-Sarah, do you think Thomas
would give me a blessing, Sarah?

04:02.372 --> 04:04.809
It always helps me so much
with my sleeping.

04:04.809 --> 04:06.507
Could you ask him for me?
-Of course.

04:06.507 --> 04:07.856
Of course, Edith. I'll ask him
as soon as I see him.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.423
-Thank you.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.685
-Oh, Janet, could you take
the lamb out of the oven

04:10.685 --> 04:12.556
for the rich table?
Just let it rest.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.645
But keep it in the foil,
all right?

04:14.645 --> 04:16.299
-Go set the poor table, quickly/

04:18.214 --> 04:20.521
-Leah, I made you a cake.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.044
Here.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.438
Now, here we go.

04:24.438 --> 04:28.093
Now, you take it home.
Don't let the parish gobble it.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.357
Come on. I'll hide it.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.884
-You will remember to ask
Father Thomas, Sarah?

04:35.884 --> 04:38.669
It's just that I don't want to
bother him at lunch.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.323
-I will, Edith.
Don't worry.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.107
I'll ask him this evening.
Can you hand me the rice?

04:42.107 --> 04:44.153
-Oh, yes.

05:22.713 --> 05:23.975
-Aah!

05:28.110 --> 05:29.285
-Here you go.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.852
Nah.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.375
Go on.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.729
-Hey, Leah.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.383
Tell Brian
what your rabbit's called.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.690
-No.
-Yeah, tell me.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.606
-It's Mary, and why is that,
Leah?

05:45.606 --> 05:47.390
-You know why.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.958
-So, Mary was visited
by an angel,

05:49.958 --> 05:52.352
and now she's pregnant.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.658
Go on, Leah. Tell him.

05:54.658 --> 05:57.095
-Yeah, tell me.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.706
Hey, where you going?

06:00.882 --> 06:03.188
Bex, come play with me.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.112
-Hey, Leah.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.637
Two Truths, One Lie.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.030
Your asthma is all in your head.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.902
God loves you.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.165
And you're an attention-seeking
little brat.

06:28.518 --> 06:31.652
-I feel sorry for you
for being so hateful!

06:31.652 --> 06:33.871
Ah!

06:35.090 --> 06:37.179
-Stop it!

06:37.179 --> 06:39.094
-Girls!

06:42.271 --> 06:43.881
-She's supposed to --

06:43.881 --> 06:45.970
She's just supposed to help me
with that sort,

06:45.970 --> 06:48.103
but I haven't seen her
for weeks now,

06:48.103 --> 06:50.801
-I'm sure we can Thomas
to make some phone calls.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.760
We'll sort it all out, Janet.
I promise.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.196
-She's gonna leave the house
to him,

06:54.196 --> 06:55.545
and she hasn't seen him
for five years.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.721
-You don't know that.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.723
-Where did you get that?

06:59.723 --> 07:01.333
-Lillian baked a cake.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.206
-Well, you can't have cake
before your dinner.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.643
Put it back.
-Oh, Janet, tough time?

07:08.384 --> 07:11.082
-Go and do your homework
and wash your hair for tomorrow.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.584
-Want to play the Stanford?

08:17.584 --> 08:19.716
I need to practice.
Can you do the right hand?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.680
One, two, three.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.712
-Sorry.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.583
-It's all right.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.935
Ah. Time for dinner.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.342
Come on, downstairs.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.831
-No, don't!

10:14.831 --> 10:16.311
No, don't, don't!

10:16.311 --> 10:18.443
-Don't, don't!
-Shhh!

10:18.443 --> 10:21.185
-Shh.

10:21.185 --> 10:25.015
It's okay.
It's only just a dream.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.758
You're okay.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.899
-We've got someone coming to
stay with us soon,

10:38.899 --> 10:41.336
someone with a little boy.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.773
Can you find some of your toys
for him to play with?

10:43.773 --> 10:46.254
-Okay.
-I brought you this to wear.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.479
-You didn't wash your hair,
did you?

10:54.479 --> 10:55.916
-No.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.047
-Well, you're gonna have to
wait for me.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.093
I'm having a shower first.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.733
-Leah, you have to
dry your hair.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.169
-I couldn't find a hairbrush.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.866
-There's one of my dresser.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.781
Come on, hurry.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.374
-Eh, call you back
in a couple months.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.985
-Forget it. We're never gonna
reach the target for the roof.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.509
-None of this.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.642
-Ah.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.600
Bishop's late.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.429
-Bishop's prerogative.

12:58.429 --> 13:01.868
-Don't tell Mom?
It's just one puff.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.522
Three. All right.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.612
Come on.
One, two, three. Ah!

13:07.612 --> 13:09.789
-Whee!
-Ahhhh!

13:09.789 --> 13:12.443
-Reach up! Whoo!

13:30.505 --> 13:34.030
-Oh. Father Thomas.

13:34.030 --> 13:37.251
I ha-- I haven't been sleeping
very well.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.079
Can I have a blessing?

13:39.079 --> 13:40.384
-Of course, Edith.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.778
This way.
-Thank you.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.824
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Yes.

14:19.597 --> 14:24.515
-Confirm, oh, Lord, your servant
with your Holy Spirit.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.866
-Leah Elizabeth.

14:30.739 --> 14:33.046
-Leah Elizabeth,

14:33.046 --> 14:37.615
God has called you by name
and made you his own.

14:47.756 --> 14:51.978
Confirm, oh, Lord, your servant
with your Holy Spirit.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.550
-Sarah.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.552
-My locket.

15:01.552 --> 15:05.513
-Leah has chosen "All creatures
of Our God and King,"

15:05.513 --> 15:08.951
number 263 in your hymn books.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.543
-Well, everyone -- look, look.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.458
-No, no, no, I'm sorry,

15:37.458 --> 15:38.676
I should have said that.
-It's gone.

15:38.676 --> 15:41.157
-We'll find it.
-We -- how? How?

15:41.157 --> 15:42.463
How are we going to find it?

15:42.463 --> 15:44.291
-The clasp must have come loose.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.641
Someone's taken it.

15:46.641 --> 15:47.772
-Sarah.
-I'm telling you.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.949
-No one's taken it.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.516
-Look, let's try and find it.
Where did you last see it?

15:52.516 --> 15:54.344
-Don't ask me
where I last saw it.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.912
-Must be in here somewhere.
Must have fallen on the floor.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.493
-Sarah?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.016
What is it?

17:41.016 --> 17:43.018
-It's the locket.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.586
It's open.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.154
-I told you, it's the clasp.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.142
-Sarah?

18:21.012 --> 18:24.233
Ah. She's sleeping. Come on.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.279
Come back to bed, please.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.691
-Your face has gone purple.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.135
You'll pass out
and fall on your head.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.008
Come on.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.792
Come on, Millie.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.067
Want to go the short cut?

19:18.331 --> 19:20.420
Come on, Millie.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.644
-We never go this way.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.124
-Stop whinging.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.344
-But I didn't know
this was the short cut.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.563
How come we never go this way,
then?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.264
-Ghosts.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.961
You know Henry VIII?

19:39.961 --> 19:42.616
He sent his soldiers
to ransack all the monasteries,

19:42.616 --> 19:45.836
and there was a monastery
just down the way.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.578
And all the monks took all
they could carry and ran away,

19:48.578 --> 19:51.102
but the soldiers,
obviously being on horseback,

19:51.102 --> 19:53.844
just chased after them, easy,

19:53.844 --> 19:56.151
and cut them down as they ran.
Czzzzzt!

20:04.725 --> 20:06.944
Loads of them died around here.

20:09.120 --> 20:13.777
You can still hear them
at night, their screams.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.823
-I'll tell Dad.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.303
-Tell Dad what?

20:17.303 --> 20:19.000
-That you're trying to scare me.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.611
-You asked. I told you.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.831
I'm not gonna mollycoddle you
like everyone else.

20:23.831 --> 20:27.922
-No, youjust don't
tell the truth!

20:27.922 --> 20:29.793
-I don't tell the truth?

20:32.753 --> 20:34.276
Millie?

20:34.276 --> 20:37.018
Millie, the road!

20:38.062 --> 20:39.412
Millie!

20:39.412 --> 20:41.109
-Millie?

21:56.402 --> 21:58.099
I can see you.

22:01.755 --> 22:06.020
-The ribbon.
It's stuck in a knot,

22:06.020 --> 22:07.761
-I have nails.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.855
You can come to my house,
if you like.

22:14.855 --> 22:17.510
I've got a rabbit.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.426
She's pregnant, but she's
never been out of her run.

22:28.695 --> 22:31.175
Millie!

22:41.621 --> 22:43.797
-Don't you dare tell Mom
about this!

22:43.797 --> 22:46.147
Promise!
-I promise!

22:46.147 --> 22:49.063
Ow!

22:49.063 --> 22:51.674
You're hurting me!

24:14.017 --> 24:15.976
-Help.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.493
-Here.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.107
What's the matter?

25:03.153 --> 25:06.287
-Tell me something.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.767
-What?

25:07.767 --> 25:09.682
-Tell me something that will
cheer me up.

25:15.818 --> 25:18.168
-What's black and white
and red all over?

25:18.168 --> 25:19.387
-I don't know.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.650
-A sunburnt nun.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.609
-Another one.

25:25.828 --> 25:28.396
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

25:28.396 --> 25:30.529
-The interrupting cow.
-The interr--

25:30.529 --> 25:32.008
-Mooooo!

25:35.359 --> 25:38.319
What was it that made you cry?

25:40.756 --> 25:43.933
Sometimes I just have bad things
in my head.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.893
Bad thoughts.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.765
-I have bad things
in my head, too.

25:49.765 --> 25:53.203
-Do you?

25:53.203 --> 25:54.770
-I'm Leah.

25:54.770 --> 25:58.034
-Leah.
-What's your name?

26:00.036 --> 26:02.561
Well, what am I supposed to
call you, dingy?

26:05.912 --> 26:07.870
Are you lost?

26:07.870 --> 26:09.916
I can ask my mom and dad.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.789
Why not?

26:13.789 --> 26:15.661
-I just need to warm up.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.097
My feet are cold.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.276
-Shh. Lay down.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.475
-Boo!

26:53.046 --> 26:55.570
Aah!
-Ah!

26:55.570 --> 26:58.878
-Ah, your feet are freezing!

26:58.878 --> 27:00.575
Do you want to play a game?

27:00.575 --> 27:03.970
It's called Two Truths, One Lie.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.755
So, okay, so when I was 5,

27:06.755 --> 27:08.278
I once smacked my teacher
on the bottom.

27:10.106 --> 27:13.936
When I was really little,
I used to suck my thumb.

27:13.936 --> 27:17.113
And last year
I had such high fever

27:17.113 --> 27:21.378
that the doctor said
I nearly died.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.467
Now you guess.

27:23.467 --> 27:27.123
-I think...

27:27.123 --> 27:29.560
Didn't smack a teacher
on the bum.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.736
And the other two are true.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.215
-That's right!

27:32.215 --> 27:34.261
She's hit me on the head
with a book once.

27:34.261 --> 27:37.003
-Really?
-For looking out the window.

27:38.918 --> 27:42.835
Okay, I'll do another one, then.

27:42.835 --> 27:47.883
I can fit five custard creams
into my mouth at the same time.

27:51.670 --> 27:56.109
My dad nearly drowned
when he was little.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.589
But he says he could feel
his guardian angel

27:58.589 --> 28:02.332
lift him up in the river
and guide him to the bank.

28:02.332 --> 28:07.947
And I -- I took something
really important by mistake.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.513
And now I've lost it.

28:09.513 --> 28:12.255
-What was it?
What did you steal?

28:12.255 --> 28:14.214
-I didn't steal it.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.259
I took it.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.261
I was gonna give it back.

28:20.263 --> 28:23.571
Something belonging to my mom.

28:23.571 --> 28:27.140
And then she was gonna find out
and I panicked.

28:27.140 --> 28:31.492
And now...
I don't know where it is.

28:31.492 --> 28:34.321
-Does she know it was you?

28:35.975 --> 28:39.282
-You're supposed to be
guessing the lie.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.763
-The custard creams.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.157
-I could fit four.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.159
-What are you gonna do now?

28:53.644 --> 28:56.343
My turn.
So, I knew this dog,

28:56.343 --> 28:57.692
and when it was a puppy,

28:57.692 --> 28:59.912
it ate a whole tube
of toothpaste,

28:59.912 --> 29:02.131
and then it pooped it out,
the tube and all.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.567
-Yuck!

29:03.567 --> 29:06.788
-And once I ate
a triple-yolked egg.

29:06.788 --> 29:10.313
And what you took,
what you lost,

29:10.313 --> 29:12.054
is in the back garden,

29:12.054 --> 29:15.362
under the windowsill,
beside the yellow rosebush.

29:37.601 --> 29:40.256
-What are you doing?

29:40.256 --> 29:41.867
Nothing.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.833
-Go to bed
before Mom hears you.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.314
-Before Mom hears you.

29:54.314 --> 29:57.230
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

30:15.422 --> 30:17.337
-Go to sleep.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.215
Leah, what are you doing?

31:53.215 --> 31:55.435
-I was thirsty.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.710
-Okay, come on.

32:09.884 --> 32:11.712
Now, straight to sleep, okay?

32:11.712 --> 32:13.540
I don't want you up again.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.204
Hello?

32:25.204 --> 32:26.945
Is someone there?

32:29.686 --> 32:31.819
Who's there?

32:36.345 --> 32:38.173
-Edith!

32:38.173 --> 32:40.697
What are you doing?

32:40.697 --> 32:43.222
-I need to speak
to Father Thomas,

32:43.222 --> 32:45.180
to get a blessing.

32:45.180 --> 32:48.140
-Well, he's -- he's giving last
rites to John Hart's mother.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.838
I don't know when
he's going to be back.

32:50.838 --> 32:53.536
How long have you been there?

32:53.536 --> 32:55.712
I'll get him to come 'round to
you first thing in the morning,

32:55.712 --> 32:57.627
I promise.
-Thank you.

33:06.288 --> 33:10.075
I can't believe she was just
sitting in the dark like that.

33:10.075 --> 33:12.251
-Dad says we need to share
what we have.

33:12.251 --> 33:14.905
-Yes, I know.

33:14.905 --> 33:17.908
But she does have her own house.

33:17.908 --> 33:20.999
-"Do not neglect show
hospitality to strangers,

33:20.999 --> 33:22.652
for by doing so,

33:22.652 --> 33:25.394
some people have shown
hospitality to angels."

33:44.283 --> 33:45.849
-It's okay.

33:45.849 --> 33:48.026
Go to sleep.

35:20.074 --> 35:22.859
-Well, I'm sure Thomas has them
in his study or something. I --

35:22.859 --> 35:25.340
-Can't reimburse you
for the bills and fuel

35:25.340 --> 35:27.429
without presenting receipts
to the parish council.

35:27.429 --> 35:28.909
-Yes, I know, Lillian.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.258
-I wanted to talk to
you about the boiler.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.217
I-I want to arrange --
-Aaah!

35:32.217 --> 35:34.175
-Oh. Oh.
-Aah!

35:34.175 --> 35:35.524
-That's it, that's it.

35:35.524 --> 35:37.439
I've got a first-aid kit
in the car.

35:37.439 --> 35:40.486
Actually, Lillian, would you
mind just going to find Thomas?

35:40.486 --> 35:41.922
He's at morning song.

35:41.922 --> 35:43.532
I'm sure he can help you
with those receipts

35:43.532 --> 35:44.664
you're looking for.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.448
-Well done.

35:48.624 --> 35:50.409
-Oh.

36:02.769 --> 36:05.337
Thank you.

36:25.879 --> 36:28.751
-Are you enjoying this banana?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.019
Oh.

36:36.019 --> 36:38.587
Mm.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.604
-The prodigal daughter returns.

36:55.604 --> 36:59.173
-Yeah, all right.
-Ah. No hugs for your dad?

36:59.173 --> 37:02.220
I don't want any breakfast.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.396
I'm too tired.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.455
-Ah. How are the women
in my life?

37:20.455 --> 37:22.240
-Queuing around the house
to leap into your lap.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.285
-Oh, quick, very quick.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.113
You got everything ready
for uni?

37:26.113 --> 37:28.681
-Uni? Look, Dad -- still trying
to get down with the kids.

37:28.681 --> 37:31.640
-Oh, well, maybe I shouldn't be
doing a 10-hour round trip

37:31.640 --> 37:35.427
on my day off to get you there,
then, if I'm so irrelevant.

37:35.427 --> 37:37.124
-Please don't feed her

37:37.124 --> 37:39.039
at the table, I've told you,

37:39.039 --> 37:41.781
-Millie is 91 in dog years.
It's to be expected, really.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.478
-Thomas, what did I just say?

37:43.478 --> 37:46.002
-Oh, poor Millie. Ooh.

37:46.002 --> 37:48.657
-Come on, eat your breakfast.

37:48.657 --> 37:51.356
-I'm hoping for a triple yolk.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.619
Have you ever had a triple yolk?

37:53.619 --> 37:55.273
I've not even had a double one.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.798
-Mm. She's got a strong
constitution, Miss Millie.

37:58.798 --> 38:02.410
Mm. Remember when she ate
all that Swiss chocolate?

38:02.410 --> 38:04.020
-Yeah, she vomited it all up
later, though,

38:04.020 --> 38:05.761
all over the doormat.
-Bex, please.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.589
We're having breakfast.
-And that party when she ate

38:07.589 --> 38:08.982
all the coronation chicken?
-Diarrhea.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.071
-Bex!

38:11.071 --> 38:14.161
-I once knew this dog, puppy,
that a whole tube of toothpaste

38:14.161 --> 38:16.859
and then pooed it out,
tube and all.

38:20.254 --> 38:21.951
-Sorry.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.392
-Who told you that?

38:43.364 --> 38:45.758
-Come in.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.281
-Sarah said it was okay.

38:47.281 --> 38:48.978
I hope it's not
too much trouble.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.632
-It's no trouble at all.
The room's free.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.634
Stay as long as you need.
-Thank you.

38:52.634 --> 38:55.028
-That's what this house is for.
It's the church's house.

38:55.028 --> 38:57.552
As much yours as it is ours.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.641
The room's just up here
on the left.

39:00.947 --> 39:04.777
-That's a good shot.

39:04.777 --> 39:05.995
Oh, sorry, that --

39:11.697 --> 39:14.439
-Ow!
-Oh, sorry! Sorry.

39:14.439 --> 39:17.093
-You could win Wimbledon
with a swing like that.

39:17.093 --> 39:19.444
-Yeah, but I can't do
a backhand.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.402
-You got to keep the racket
straight.

39:21.402 --> 39:24.579
Hey.

39:31.891 --> 39:34.372
-Stop.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.982
-Stop.

39:41.857 --> 39:44.512
-Kyla!
-Stop, stop!

39:46.209 --> 39:48.690
-Come here.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.873
-Irreconcilable.

39:57.873 --> 39:59.919
-I-R-R-E...
-Uh-huh.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.530
-...C-O-N...
-Yes.

40:02.530 --> 40:07.535
-...C-I-O...

40:07.535 --> 40:09.102
-"Lable." Label.

40:09.102 --> 40:11.496
-Oh.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.847
-L-A-B-L-E.
-Yes!

40:15.891 --> 40:18.851
Mm. Whoa!

40:18.851 --> 40:21.027
That was --
That was the biggest so far.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.120
-That one is like the --

40:27.120 --> 40:28.556
that is the same size
as your head.

40:28.556 --> 40:32.430
Oh! Sorry.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.388
Okay.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.437
You nearly done?

40:40.525 --> 40:41.787
Time for bed?

42:13.008 --> 42:15.533
-Which one was it.
Your lie?

42:15.533 --> 42:16.882
Which one?

42:18.710 --> 42:23.497
-I found something else
under the yellow roses.

42:23.497 --> 42:25.325
-What did you find?

42:28.328 --> 42:30.286
What's the matter?

42:30.286 --> 42:31.549
-A thing.

42:41.471 --> 42:44.518
Your turn.

42:44.518 --> 42:46.346
-I like meringues.

42:46.346 --> 42:49.262
-Everybody likes meringues.

42:49.262 --> 42:51.438
-I hate spaghetti.

42:51.438 --> 42:53.309
-You don't want to play.

42:53.309 --> 42:56.965
-Okay, I'm thinking.

42:56.965 --> 42:59.185
My mom wears this cardigan

42:59.185 --> 43:02.710
with the top button missing.

43:02.710 --> 43:07.193
And she says every time she
tries to sew on a new button,

43:07.193 --> 43:08.977
it falls off.

43:08.977 --> 43:12.111
So she just keep wearing it
without the top button.

43:12.111 --> 43:15.375
-Spaghetti, obviously.

43:15.375 --> 43:16.855
My turn.

43:16.855 --> 43:19.074
I can sing the alphabet song
backwards.

43:19.074 --> 43:21.903
I used to eat jelly cubes,
the raw cubes,

43:21.903 --> 43:24.036
when I was little.

43:24.036 --> 43:27.561
-Oh, you shouldn't.
They're made of bones.

43:27.561 --> 43:28.780
Cow bones.

43:28.780 --> 43:30.520
-And what you lost --

43:30.520 --> 43:32.174
it's near the old shed,

43:32.174 --> 43:35.961
behind the back,
right under the window.

46:14.336 --> 46:17.818
-Come.

46:17.818 --> 46:19.602
-Leah?

46:19.602 --> 46:21.387
Where are you going?

46:21.387 --> 46:23.041
-Taking out the dog,

46:23.041 --> 46:25.521
-Well, just stay in
the church grounds, okay?

46:25.521 --> 46:27.001
-Because of the ghosts?

46:27.001 --> 46:28.873
-What?

46:28.873 --> 46:30.613
-Bex said.

46:33.007 --> 46:35.227
-It's an incense boat,

46:35.227 --> 46:37.882
Zach Barnes found it
with his metal detector.

46:37.882 --> 46:41.233
-Did the monks drop it
when they ran away?

46:41.233 --> 46:43.931
-We don't know.

46:43.931 --> 46:47.456
But people don't leave their
spirits behind when they die.

46:47.456 --> 46:50.242
Only things, only memories.

46:51.504 --> 46:54.463
-They go to Heaven.
-Mm.

46:54.463 --> 46:56.378
-What about Hell?

47:00.208 --> 47:02.297
-It's not fire and brimstone.

47:02.297 --> 47:04.430
It's...

47:04.430 --> 47:06.258
It's darkness.

47:06.258 --> 47:09.696
It's the absence of love.

47:09.696 --> 47:12.438
God's love is like sunlight,

47:12.438 --> 47:16.834
seeks out every shadow,
every place of darkness.

47:20.228 --> 47:22.317
-But what if you hide?

47:29.455 --> 47:33.676
-You know what this music is?

47:33.676 --> 47:37.332
It's called
"Non Móriar Sed Vívam."

47:37.332 --> 47:38.986
Do you know what that means?

47:38.986 --> 47:42.642
-"I should not die but live."

49:11.035 --> 49:12.427
-Knock, knock.

49:12.427 --> 49:14.299
-Who's there?

49:14.299 --> 49:15.953
-The interrupting tomato.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.172
-The interr--
-Splat!

49:25.875 --> 49:27.965
Did you find out?

49:27.965 --> 49:29.444
-What?

49:29.444 --> 49:32.186
-Which one was the lie.

49:45.025 --> 49:46.722
-You want me to go?

49:48.550 --> 49:50.726
I thought I kept you company.

49:50.726 --> 49:52.511
-You do. I just...

49:52.511 --> 49:53.991
-Thought you liked me.

49:58.821 --> 50:02.521
-We can play one game,
if you like.

50:02.521 --> 50:04.523
-Okay.

50:13.010 --> 50:16.100
-You sound like
you've got an infection.

50:16.100 --> 50:19.277
I get infections in my chest.

50:19.277 --> 50:21.888
-Is that why you nearly died?
-What?

50:21.888 --> 50:23.716
-You said the first time
we played

50:23.716 --> 50:25.457
that when you were little,
you got so ill

50:25.457 --> 50:26.849
that you nearly died.

50:26.849 --> 50:29.809
-I was born early.

50:29.809 --> 50:31.550
-Why were you born early?

50:35.380 --> 50:37.034
-Some babies are.

50:41.299 --> 50:42.822
-My turn.

50:42.822 --> 50:44.345
I hatepineapple.

50:44.345 --> 50:46.652
-You didn't like it
when I did spaghetti.

50:48.523 --> 50:50.177
-And what you took --

50:50.177 --> 50:52.179
it's on the top shelf
of the dresser

50:52.179 --> 50:54.442
in the kitchen.

50:56.575 --> 50:58.272
And these are just
my pretend wings

50:58.272 --> 51:01.014
until my real one grow.

51:01.014 --> 51:03.756
They're little stumps
on my back right now.

51:03.756 --> 51:07.629
I am actuallyan angel.

51:14.288 --> 51:16.290
-Shhh.

51:22.427 --> 51:26.170
-Shh, shh, shh, shh.

51:26.170 --> 51:28.563
Shhhh.

51:28.563 --> 51:32.263
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

51:47.234 --> 51:49.018
-What's happening?

51:52.718 --> 51:55.112
-Don't look.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.983
Don't look!

52:22.878 --> 52:24.880
-Warm water coming from
the cold tap.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.360
-Mm.
-That's dangerous.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.275
-All right.
-I've got some money.

52:28.275 --> 52:30.016
Let me give him a call.
-Okay.

52:30.016 --> 52:33.585
-Just tell Sarah that, um, hmm,
the church arranged it.

52:33.585 --> 52:35.195
Think of it as a long-term loan.

52:35.195 --> 52:36.936
-I am the way...

52:36.936 --> 52:39.286
-And take the house in Devon.
You all need a holiday.

52:39.286 --> 52:42.071
-I'm not sure if Sarah --
-Hello, Chris, hi.

52:42.071 --> 52:45.292
Yes. I-I just need to ask
a favor.

52:45.292 --> 52:48.469
Hot water coming from
the cold tap in the kitchen.

52:48.469 --> 52:51.516
Yes, Thursday's fine.

52:51.516 --> 52:54.649
Um, yes, uh,
I'll see you afternoon day then.

52:54.649 --> 52:56.173
Yes, thank you, Chris.

52:56.173 --> 52:58.914
Oh, hello, Becca.

52:58.914 --> 53:02.527
Um, so how are you getting on
with the fuel receipts?

53:02.527 --> 53:04.746
The parish council needs to
make payment this month.

53:04.746 --> 53:07.880
-Sorry. I meant to check the --
-How's Thursday?

53:09.273 --> 53:12.928
I said hello, Rebecca.

53:12.928 --> 53:14.234
-Leah.
-Aah!

53:17.672 --> 53:20.022
-Um...

53:20.022 --> 53:22.199
-Here.

53:23.896 --> 53:26.377
-What are they?

53:26.377 --> 53:28.117
Teeth?

53:28.117 --> 53:29.945
-Baby teeth.

53:29.945 --> 53:33.079
The girls'.
I'd forgotten they were there.

53:50.575 --> 53:52.272
-He's teething.

53:52.272 --> 53:54.187
Didn't sleep well.

53:54.187 --> 53:57.016
Grabbing hold of everything
he can chew.

54:19.821 --> 54:21.606
-Where did you find it?

54:21.606 --> 54:24.957
-In the garden, behind the shed.

54:24.957 --> 54:28.090
-What were you doing back there?

54:28.090 --> 54:30.223
-Exploring.

54:35.924 --> 54:38.013
Such a long time.

54:40.015 --> 54:42.279
It's been missing.

54:42.279 --> 54:44.846
-That's why I sewed it back on.

54:47.371 --> 54:50.243
-The thread is very pink.

54:50.243 --> 54:52.071
I like it, though.

54:54.203 --> 54:56.858
It's a bit loose,
but I can make it tighter.

55:01.385 --> 55:04.605
What are you doing rattling
around the house so much?

55:07.913 --> 55:10.568
-Will you read with me?

55:10.568 --> 55:12.744
-Oh, I haven't finished
the dishes.

55:15.094 --> 55:17.923
It'll have to be quick,
10 minutes.

55:17.923 --> 55:21.013
-20.
-8.

55:21.013 --> 55:23.102
-15.
-5.

55:23.102 --> 55:25.191
-Okay, 10.

55:36.158 --> 55:39.292
"But God knows how to
make the story end just right

55:39.292 --> 55:42.121
in the way that's best for us.

55:42.121 --> 55:46.343
'Do you really believe that,
Mother?' Peter asked quietly.

55:46.343 --> 55:50.303
'Yes,' she said,
'I do believe it almost always,

55:50.303 --> 55:53.306
except when I'm so sad
that I can't believe anything.'"

56:02.446 --> 56:04.926
Mom?
-Mm-hmm.

56:06.493 --> 56:09.148
-I...

56:14.458 --> 56:16.373
-He's choking!

56:16.373 --> 56:18.984
He's choking!

56:18.984 --> 56:21.595
-He's okay, he's okay,
he's okay.

56:25.207 --> 56:26.644
It's okay. It's okay.

56:33.477 --> 56:34.826
It's okay.

57:45.244 --> 57:48.421
What's the matter with you?

57:48.421 --> 57:51.206
-I'm cold.

57:51.206 --> 57:53.426
Everything hurts.

57:53.426 --> 57:55.428
-Maybe...

57:55.428 --> 57:58.475
maybe I should go and --
-I'll be okay!

57:58.475 --> 58:00.215
I just need to warm up.

58:16.057 --> 58:18.233
-We're friends, aren't we?

58:25.371 --> 58:28.200
I here to help you.

58:28.200 --> 58:31.638
Guardian angel.

58:31.638 --> 58:34.162
So, let's play.

58:34.162 --> 58:35.947
-Don't want to.

58:50.135 --> 58:53.486
-Do-do, do-do, do-do.

58:53.486 --> 58:56.881
-Last time we said
it was supposed to be

58:56.881 --> 58:59.448
two truths, one lie,

58:59.448 --> 59:03.975
but you said --
you said you had angel wings,

59:03.975 --> 59:05.454
real ones growing.

59:05.454 --> 59:08.196
-Do you want to see?

59:08.196 --> 59:10.068
Go on, look.

59:34.658 --> 59:37.486
-What is it?

59:43.405 --> 59:47.496
You see?
Soon I'll have real wings.

59:49.107 --> 59:50.369
-Play?

59:50.369 --> 59:52.937
-Please go.
I don't want to!

59:52.937 --> 59:55.679
-Okay, then. My turn.

59:55.679 --> 1:00:00.031
In the Bible,
Jacob didn't wantto marry Leah.

1:00:00.031 --> 1:00:01.946
He was tricked.

1:00:04.383 --> 1:00:06.777
Your mother will
never forgive you

1:00:06.777 --> 1:00:09.388
if you don't find
what you stole.

1:00:12.957 --> 1:00:16.308
And what
you took, what you lost,

1:00:16.308 --> 1:00:18.615
it's in a hole
above the first branch

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:19.964
of the yew tree in the garden.

1:00:19.964 --> 1:00:21.618
-Please go!

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:23.141
-I'm your guardian angel,
aren't I?

1:00:23.141 --> 1:00:25.056
-Go!

1:00:25.056 --> 1:00:26.405
-I don't want you here!

1:00:26.405 --> 1:00:27.841
-Come out!

1:00:27.841 --> 1:00:31.628
Out! Come out. Come out!

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:33.673
Out! Out! Out!

1:00:33.673 --> 1:00:37.677
-Leah? Leah, shh.

1:00:37.677 --> 1:00:40.288
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a dream.

1:00:40.288 --> 1:00:42.813
It's okay. Shhh.

1:00:42.813 --> 1:00:44.553
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

1:00:44.553 --> 1:00:46.599
It was just a dream.
You're okay.

1:00:46.599 --> 1:00:49.907
Shhh.
Let's get you into bed.

1:02:35.795 --> 1:02:38.667
It's all my fault.

1:02:38.667 --> 1:02:42.236
I knew -- I knew that...

1:02:42.236 --> 1:02:44.586
she hadn't sewn
the button on properly,

1:02:44.586 --> 1:02:46.980
and I was supposed to sew it on.

1:02:46.980 --> 1:02:48.677
-Look, it must have
just fallen off.

1:02:48.677 --> 1:02:51.158
It was an accident.
He's okay. No one's hurt.

1:02:51.158 --> 1:02:52.507
-No, it's --

1:02:54.683 --> 1:02:56.468
-Leah?

1:02:56.468 --> 1:02:58.818
What happened?

1:03:13.137 --> 1:03:14.878
Leah?

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:22.276
So, what were you doing?

1:03:22.276 --> 1:03:25.062
-I just wanted to
climb the tree.

1:03:28.456 --> 1:03:31.242
-I was wondering --

1:03:31.242 --> 1:03:34.071
we haven't had a holiday
this summer,

1:03:34.071 --> 1:03:36.813
Lillian's offered us a week
at her flat in Devon,

1:03:36.813 --> 1:03:40.120
and I thought we could go.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:43.080
Would that be good?

1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:44.908
-Would Mom say yes?

1:03:52.611 --> 1:03:55.875
Lillian baked us a cake.

1:03:55.875 --> 1:03:58.182
Mom threw it away.

1:04:02.447 --> 1:04:04.318
-I'll talk to Mom.

1:05:45.202 --> 1:05:46.899
-Are you hurting?

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:06.745
I know you're not...

1:06:10.096 --> 1:06:11.837
...my angel.

1:06:14.318 --> 1:06:17.799
-I'd like to have been.

1:06:17.799 --> 1:06:20.280
We're friends.

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:21.978
Still?

1:06:25.982 --> 1:06:28.636
Will you help me?

1:06:28.636 --> 1:06:30.899
You need something,

1:06:30.899 --> 1:06:32.945
and I need something.

1:06:32.945 --> 1:06:34.555
My name.

1:06:34.555 --> 1:06:35.774
-And then?

1:06:38.037 --> 1:06:39.996
-And then it will be okay.

1:06:44.565 --> 1:06:47.960
-Will you...stop?

1:06:50.397 --> 1:06:52.095
-A deal?

1:06:52.095 --> 1:06:54.445
My name for what you've lost?

1:06:59.145 --> 1:07:02.279
Let's play.

1:07:02.279 --> 1:07:04.150
There's someone...

1:07:04.150 --> 1:07:06.761
Someone else your mother
will never forgive,

1:07:06.761 --> 1:07:10.635
someone she hates
even more than your father,

1:07:10.635 --> 1:07:12.724
even more than you.

1:07:23.517 --> 1:07:27.782
The next time I come here
will be the last time.

1:07:33.310 --> 1:07:34.702
-It's not true.

1:07:34.702 --> 1:07:37.836
-And what you took,
what you lost,

1:07:37.836 --> 1:07:40.273
what you stole...

1:07:40.273 --> 1:07:45.104
is hidden in the brambles
beside the road sign

1:07:45.104 --> 1:07:46.714
of Martyrs Lane.

1:07:46.714 --> 1:07:48.934
-She doesn't hate my father.

1:07:48.934 --> 1:07:50.544
She doesn't hate me.

1:07:50.544 --> 1:07:51.980
She wishes you had died

1:07:51.980 --> 1:07:53.895
and someone else had lived.

1:07:53.895 --> 1:07:56.246
-No!

1:08:31.977 --> 1:08:34.414
-Sarah, could you get
these receipts

1:08:34.414 --> 1:08:36.416
to Lillian this morning?
I-I'm so sorry.

1:08:36.416 --> 1:08:38.679
We won't have any expenses
for the summer.

1:08:41.378 --> 1:08:43.641
-Thanks.

1:08:55.740 --> 1:08:57.742
-Oh.

1:09:08.709 --> 1:09:10.058
Lillian?

1:09:10.058 --> 1:09:12.148
-Hello.
-Hello?

1:09:15.107 --> 1:09:16.804
-Sarah.

1:09:19.329 --> 1:09:21.940
Oh. How good of you to come.

1:09:24.943 --> 1:09:27.424
Ah. Oh, uh, the fuel receipts.

1:09:27.424 --> 1:09:30.035
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

1:09:30.035 --> 1:09:32.168
-I think they'll be good
in this vase.

1:09:32.168 --> 1:09:36.476
-Oh, this is, um --
this is Amy, my daughter-in-law.

1:09:36.476 --> 1:09:39.175
Um, I'm not sure --
I'm not sure that you've met.

1:09:39.175 --> 1:09:42.090
Amy, this is, uh, Sarah.

1:09:42.090 --> 1:09:43.831
-Hello.

1:09:43.831 --> 1:09:46.443
-Freddy, do you mind taking
those cases upstairs?

1:09:46.443 --> 1:09:48.140
-Of course.

1:09:54.277 --> 1:09:56.148
-Can I -- Can I get you
a -- a cup of tea

1:09:56.148 --> 1:09:59.195
or, um, a glass of water
or -- or something?

1:10:00.718 --> 1:10:02.198
-Mom.

1:10:29.964 --> 1:10:31.836
Rest now.

1:10:33.881 --> 1:10:37.450
-Leah.

1:10:37.450 --> 1:10:39.365
-Don't worry.

1:10:39.365 --> 1:10:41.585
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:13:10.255 --> 1:13:12.692
-What are you doing?
Come here.

1:13:12.692 --> 1:13:14.390
Oh.

1:13:27.881 --> 1:13:29.317
-Okay. Breathe in.

1:13:29.317 --> 1:13:31.450
-Hold.

1:13:31.450 --> 1:13:34.061
One, two, three.

1:13:34.061 --> 1:13:35.672
And breathe out.
Breathe in.

1:13:35.672 --> 1:13:37.804
-Hold.

1:13:37.804 --> 1:13:40.764
One, two, three, four, five,

1:13:40.764 --> 1:13:43.114
six, seven, eight, breathe out.

1:13:46.596 --> 1:13:48.424
-...demand that she tells him
never to come.

1:13:48.424 --> 1:13:50.077
-Please be --
-10 years, Sarah!

1:13:50.077 --> 1:13:52.471
-You've forgiven him
so easily, so easily.

1:13:52.471 --> 1:13:54.212
-You don't know what I've done
or haven't done.

1:13:54.212 --> 1:13:55.822
-No, I don't,
because you don't tell me.

1:13:55.822 --> 1:13:57.433
It's between you and your God.

1:13:57.433 --> 1:13:59.957
-He's her son!
Dare we go there now?

1:13:59.957 --> 1:14:01.741
Ask him to leave his home?
-I want you to do something,

1:14:01.741 --> 1:14:03.439
feel something.

1:14:12.926 --> 1:14:15.407
-Promise me you won't tell?

1:14:15.407 --> 1:14:17.148
-No.

1:14:17.148 --> 1:14:20.368
-Then I won't tell you.

1:14:20.368 --> 1:14:22.936
Okay, I won't tell.

1:14:54.098 --> 1:14:55.578
Where did you find these?

1:14:55.578 --> 1:14:57.841
-Everywhere.
-How?

1:15:01.105 --> 1:15:04.587
Look, I'm leaving here tomorrow.

1:15:04.587 --> 1:15:06.371
I want you, in the morning,

1:15:06.371 --> 1:15:08.504
to dig a hole
and bury all of this,

1:15:08.504 --> 1:15:12.072
just bury it deep in the ground
and never think about it again.

1:15:14.292 --> 1:15:16.860
Just look after yourself.

1:15:22.126 --> 1:15:24.998
-Bex?
-What?

1:15:24.998 --> 1:15:26.565
-Have you seen her?

1:15:31.048 --> 1:15:34.225
-No.

1:15:36.227 --> 1:15:38.577
Did you hear what I said?

1:15:38.577 --> 1:15:40.710
Give this up.

1:15:40.710 --> 1:15:43.060
No more, okay?

1:15:43.060 --> 1:15:46.237
No more. Promise me.

1:15:47.281 --> 1:15:49.457
Promise!

1:16:07.214 --> 1:16:09.042
-What are you doing?

1:16:09.042 --> 1:16:10.870
-Sleeping here tonight.

1:16:12.306 --> 1:16:14.395
Shut your eyes.

1:16:23.535 --> 1:16:26.451
-I can't you still sleep
with Mini Mill.

1:16:29.367 --> 1:16:31.891
-Ow!

1:16:31.891 --> 1:16:33.371
-Go to sleep.

1:17:24.552 --> 1:17:28.382
-Ah!
I'll be back late tonight.

1:17:28.382 --> 1:17:32.038
Look after your mother, okay?
Mwah.

1:17:32.038 --> 1:17:35.563
Ah, unbridled hedonism,
here we come.

1:17:35.563 --> 1:17:37.261
-Yeah, you're dropping me off
outside the campus, Dad.

1:17:37.261 --> 1:17:38.697
-I know, I know.

1:17:38.697 --> 1:17:40.090
-Wait.
Haven't you got Mini Mill?

1:17:40.090 --> 1:17:41.352
-No.
-I'll get her.

1:17:41.352 --> 1:17:44.355
-Leah, no, I --
-Oh, come on.

1:17:44.355 --> 1:17:46.618
She'll fight off
all your boyfriends.

1:18:14.864 --> 1:18:16.779
-Woof, woof. Grr!

1:18:16.779 --> 1:18:19.346
-Leah. Great, thanks.

1:18:48.636 --> 1:18:51.335
-Ah!

1:21:32.626 --> 1:21:34.890
Rachel.

1:21:42.985 --> 1:21:44.769
Rachel.

1:21:48.251 --> 1:21:50.775
-Her name.

1:21:53.256 --> 1:21:56.694
I took it -- the curl.

1:21:56.694 --> 1:21:59.523
I just wanted to know
what it was.

1:21:59.523 --> 1:22:02.439
Bex told me it was better
to keep her out.

1:22:02.439 --> 1:22:05.007
But I think it's better
to let her in.

1:22:05.007 --> 1:22:08.140
-No, Leah.

1:22:08.140 --> 1:22:11.361
No, no! No.

1:22:11.361 --> 1:22:12.971
No.

1:22:23.112 --> 1:22:24.852
-See?

1:22:29.466 --> 1:22:31.294
I found it.

1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:48.224
In the Bible,
Jacob loved Rachel,

1:22:48.224 --> 1:22:49.268
not Leah.

1:22:49.268 --> 1:22:51.749
-Oh, Leah, no.

1:22:53.751 --> 1:22:55.753
-Will you tell me?

1:23:07.330 --> 1:23:09.941
We weren't...

1:23:09.941 --> 1:23:12.900
We weren't expecting
to have another baby.

1:23:15.860 --> 1:23:19.777
But when I found out
I was pregnant with you,

1:23:19.777 --> 1:23:23.650
I was soexcited,
I was so happy.

1:23:25.957 --> 1:23:27.654
And then...

1:23:29.830 --> 1:23:32.094
Then something terrible
happened.

1:23:34.835 --> 1:23:37.621
It was such a beautiful day.

1:23:40.276 --> 1:23:42.017
It happened just like that.

1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:47.109
So quickly.

1:23:47.109 --> 1:23:48.675
Like a chalk snap.

1:23:51.548 --> 1:23:57.815
And then...
my contractions started.

1:23:57.815 --> 1:24:02.298
You were coming.
Too early.

1:24:02.298 --> 1:24:07.216
This...tiny little thing,

1:24:07.216 --> 1:24:12.656
covered in blood in my arms,
and I was still...

1:24:12.656 --> 1:24:15.224
trying to understand
how everything had shifted,

1:24:15.224 --> 1:24:19.228
how...

1:24:19.228 --> 1:24:23.319
It was like I had gone
through a mirror

1:24:23.319 --> 1:24:26.452
into a world where...

1:24:26.452 --> 1:24:28.715
she was gone and you here.

1:24:31.892 --> 1:24:34.765
And I felt like I was
in the wrong place.

1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:40.814
That I had to come back somehow,
but I couldn't.

1:24:43.948 --> 1:24:46.559
Just couldn't function.

1:24:46.559 --> 1:24:48.170
Couldn't do anything.

1:24:51.825 --> 1:24:53.697
I could see you.

1:24:56.221 --> 1:24:58.658
I can see how beautiful
you were.

1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:02.706
But I couldn't feel anything.

1:25:11.976 --> 1:25:14.718
-She wants you to say it.

1:25:14.718 --> 1:25:16.415
You have to say her name.

1:25:17.547 --> 1:25:20.071
Please, Mom, just say it.

1:25:20.071 --> 1:25:23.292
-Please, Mom, just say it!

1:25:23.292 --> 1:25:25.816
You have to say her name.

1:25:25.816 --> 1:25:28.514
-Rachel.

1:25:31.387 --> 1:25:33.432
-I'm so, so sorry.

1:25:59.154 --> 1:26:00.938
-Will you tell Dad?

1:26:04.376 --> 1:26:06.639
-I don't think he'll understand.

1:26:12.471 --> 1:26:14.256
Perhaps we should move.

1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:19.174
-Could Dad get another job?

1:26:19.174 --> 1:26:20.827
-I think so.

1:26:23.482 --> 1:26:25.180
He did before.

1:26:27.443 --> 1:26:29.271
But I wanted to stay.

1:26:34.624 --> 1:26:36.278
Go to sleep now.

1:28:47.670 --> 1:28:49.454
-Mom?

1:28:58.985 --> 1:29:00.247
Mom?

1:29:13.260 --> 1:29:14.653
-Mom?

1:29:14.653 --> 1:29:18.004
-Oh, my darling.

1:29:18.004 --> 1:29:19.789
-I'm cold.

1:29:19.789 --> 1:29:21.268
I need you.

1:29:22.313 --> 1:29:25.098
-Oh.

1:29:25.098 --> 1:29:27.579
-No!

1:29:27.579 --> 1:29:28.711
You can't have her.

1:29:28.711 --> 1:29:29.842
Ah!

1:29:31.017 --> 1:29:32.497
-You can do it.

1:29:32.497 --> 1:29:33.803
-No!

1:29:33.803 --> 1:29:35.761
You need to let her go.

1:29:35.761 --> 1:29:38.242
Please, Mom, come with me.

1:29:38.242 --> 1:29:39.504
-I love you.

1:29:39.504 --> 1:29:42.768
-Mom. Mom, come here.
Mom!

1:29:42.768 --> 1:29:46.206
-Mom, don't look at her.
Don't look at her!

1:30:00.220 --> 1:30:01.352
-Mom!

1:30:01.352 --> 1:30:03.267
-No!

1:30:03.267 --> 1:30:05.487
You have to tell her to go!

1:30:05.487 --> 1:30:07.706
-Aah!

1:30:09.273 --> 1:30:11.318
-Mom, make her go!

1:31:48.067 --> 1:31:51.201
Leah, time to go.

1:32:01.690 --> 1:32:04.562
-The piano stays
for the time being.

1:32:04.562 --> 1:32:09.436
I'm not sure
we'll have room for it.

1:32:55.700 --> 1:32:57.267
-Mom?
