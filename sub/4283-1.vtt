09:37.600 --> 09:41.000
I said I sucked his dick
the night before last.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
My crib was in St.Arbansdale.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Not to far where we grow up.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
It is not like Tommy's crib

09:50.000 --> 09:52.600
I love living around the way.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
You cannot trust him,
you know that.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Look, Tommy,

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000

too smart for his own good.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.500
Who? Black?

17:45.500 --> 17:47.500

51:19.500 --> 51:23.500
Who the fuck you think

51:23.800 --> 51:25.500
I told you stupid ass!

51:25.500 --> 51:28.400
Don’t call the crib from da spot!

51:28.500 --> 51:30.100
And how the fuck you
got this number?

51:30.200 --> 51:33.400
The bitch gave me the number, nigga.
What the fuck you talkin about?

51:33.500 --> 51:35.500
Tommy, that's muy word.

51:38.500 --> 51:41.400
That's your word...

51:45.500 --> 51:48.000
- What's up with Knowledge?
- Fuck Knowledge.

51:48.100 --> 51:50.500
Roll up.
I'm tryin to get high.

52:15.500 --> 52:20.500
Hey bartender,

52:32.500 --> 52:34.500
Let's get it on in

52:34.500 --> 52:38.900
Bounce that shit!

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
- That's mine?
- Yeah.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.500
What's the deal?

53:26.500 --> 53:30.300
Nigga, a nigga like me,
when I show my appreciation...

53:30.400 --> 53:32.100
You know what I'm sayin?

53:32.601 --> 53:35.701
Remember, I said I came down
here to check niggas in the whole 9,

53:35.702 --> 53:37.102
especially you, son.

53:37.603 --> 53:40.403
I got a present from my man.

53:42.500 --> 53:43.500
What's that?

53:49.500 --> 53:51.500
Knowledge.

54:31.500 --> 54:33.500
Get in the fuckin car!

54:43.401 --> 54:47.901
Nancy Sister "Bam bam"

56:21.500 --> 56:24.500
The more and more I was readin
the Minister's book

56:24.500 --> 56:28.500
the more I realized how fucked up
the whole process was.

56:28.600 --> 56:31.500
I mean, we all have
knowledge itself,

56:31.500 --> 56:35.400
but still we was actin like
fuckin idiots.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.500
That nigga Josh...

56:54.500 --> 56:56.500
that nigga is fuckin crazy!

56:59.500 --> 57:05.500
If I was me, I will bury them niggas
as soon as they said some'm.

57:05.500 --> 57:07.500
What the fuck's you talkin bout?

57:07.500 --> 57:09.500
You was right there
and didn't say shit.

57:12.500 --> 57:15.500
What the fuck you talkin about?

57:55.500 --> 57:58.500
I know you not gon let this
nigga talk to you like that.

57:58.500 --> 57:59.600
What's goin on?

58:00.100 --> 58:02.800
Nah, bitch nigga ain't
no bitch to me.

58:08.500 --> 58:11.400
Nigga, what?

58:12.500 --> 58:14.500
Some real shit now, what?

58:14.500 --> 58:18.500
Chill, chill.

58:18.500 --> 58:22.500
Ain't no mistakes.
This nigga talk too much.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.800
After Wise got smoked,

58:55.800 --> 58:59.400
Buns was so drunk and high
that just stay there.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.500
But Buns is a instigator for real.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.400
Close door!

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.500
Yeah, I accept.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.500
What's up, son?

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.200
Who is, Buns?
What's the deal, my nigga?

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.400
Fucked up...

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.000
I need some help.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.100
I told you, I wasn't fuck with
you no more, man.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500
Yeah, yeah, I know...

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.400
I got arrested on
some bullshit last night.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.500
I gotta get the fuck outta here
before my ...  come back!

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.500
The Benz, take that shit to Ox.
Tell him...

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.500
Remember, dawg.
You my nigga.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.500
No doubt. I got you.
Don't even worry about it.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.900
- Peace.
- One.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.500
Wanna ramp with me?

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:56.001
Come on! Me shot
pussy-(w)hole people for fun!

01:02:56.202 --> 01:02:58.202

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.500
You don't know me!

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.900
You wanna ramp with

01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:19.001
Come on! I murder

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.100
You wanna ramp with
bombaclad me!

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.500
When I finally found
Ox' house, there was cops everywhere.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500
Damn!

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.500
I drove around Queens
for a like an hour a half.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.100
Finally I went to
Rosdale Projects.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.700
Me and Buns used to hang
there back in the days.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.500
When I arrived, I saw
my man Shorty out there.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.300
Shorty was like 12
goin on 20

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500
A real looser type nigga.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500
No hope for the future at all.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.600
and he was right.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.900
Whattup, Shorty?

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.500
On the roof?

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.500
Shot this nigga, man.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.200
Fuckin with guns...

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.400
When you fuck with guns, Shorty...

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.500
Mad niggas is dyin.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500
Be careful, man.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.500
I like your style.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.200
For real.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500
Aight?

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.700
My nigga.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:37.300
You're out.
Open the gate.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:59.500
Buns was an animal
out of cage, for real.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.200
All right! Here we go!

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.200
It's your court or some'm?

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.300
I'm Roger.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.000
How you doin, Tommy?

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.500
I just came lookin for you.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.399
For what?

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.200
When I heard that...

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.500
I wanna meet you in person.

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.500
Don't get nervous.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.500
You gotta pay attention
and listen to me.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.500
Listen what I tell you.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.500
Only give you a choice.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.500
What kind of choice?

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.700
Yeah, you got a choice.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.500
Now you are in a lot of trouble.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:13.100
Without us, you go to jail.
You go to jail forever.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.500
You understand?

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.000
So who I gotta blest?

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.800
Someone called the Minister.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.700
Your job is gettin in his
organization and learn his ways.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.500
At New year's Eve he's having
a big gathering.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.200
Armery, on Harlem.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.200
On that night,
you'll terminate this fucker.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.500
We'll do everythin to
help you, all the help necessary.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500
If you show any weakness,

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.899
or if you betrayed us...

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.500
it'll be your resignation.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.800
Understand?

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.800
Yeah, I understand.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.700
Don't fuck around, Buns.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.500
But seriously...

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.400
We need to start thinkin
about us,

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.500
because this is too
dangerous now.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.500
It's not safe anymore.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:26.400
I feel like it's time for us
to go away from here.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.400
I've been thinkin in that
for a long time.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.500
Tee...

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.500
Let's go to Africa.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.500
Please... Be for real.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.500
I never been more
serious in my life.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:49.500
We been in everywhere.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.600
Who says we can't go
to Africa?

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.500
I mean...

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.500
I don't know...
Africa is far.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.900
So what?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.500
I'm just sayin.
Think about us.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.500
That's our dream.
Go to homeland.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.500
Where our root are.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500
Fuck it, man...

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.500
Forget about money.
Fuck everything.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.500
Is the chance of our lifetime.
If you and me went...

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.600
and the baby.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.500
Just think.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.500
Maybe is the right thing to do.
Maybe not.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.500
I'll think about it.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.500
Buns, was supposed
to take out the Minister.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.400
Apparently, they need a nigga to do it,

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.500
And Tommy was perfect.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500
He had to start from the bottom,

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.200
really take it serious.
With the religion.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.400
He had to study
and really be a part of it.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.900
Cause it wasn't be easy
to get close to the Minister.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:06.500
Meanwhile, Knowledge and
Shameek...

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.500
You know, for a little
payback.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.200
And Knowledge knew where Kisha lived.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.500
the more, you know,
the truth is like the light.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.800
No matter what clouds the truth.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.500
Eventually the sun
will come out.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.800
And you cannot stop the sun
from shining.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:38.500
For the first time the sun
was finally shinin on Bundy.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.000
What the fuck are you
doin in my house?

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.500
Relax, Shorty.
Nobody'll fuck with you.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.000
Word up.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.500
Why you don't get your
stinky ass out of my
motherfuckin house...

01:13:07.501 --> 01:13:09.401
and take out your
broke-ass niggas with you?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.600
We're just here lookin for this nigga,
hoping maybe Since...

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.900
can tell us where he is.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.500
Shit...

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.900
Don't worry.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.500
Just tell Sin.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.800
We don't mean to worry the God
but we really need to find this fucker.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.500
You fuckin serious?

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.500
A'yo, peace, shorty.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.100
Stay cool.
Don't hurt nobody.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.800
God...

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.600
I can't believe it.
He wanna meet me up in Harlem.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.500
I don't even know what's goin on.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.500
First of all, how the fuck
he got out the jail?

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.100
Maybe this nigga...

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.500
It could be a set up.
You can't even tell with this nigga.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
You know, Buns is my dawg, but...

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:28.300
This nigga is hard to tell sometimes.

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.500
He could be ill when
he wanna be.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.100
Yo, Buns, what up, nigga?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.500
How you doin?

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.500
I been tryin to call you.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.500
How you don't call me back?

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.500
Hard to tell.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.200
I went to Ox' house...

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.500
then I called Mark
to tell him what happened.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:05.500
I got no response.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.500
Hard about Ox...

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.100
You know, Sin?

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.500
You be always right.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.200
We were in the road destruction
from the begining.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.500
The Minister
show us the right path.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.600
Listen, dawg.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.500
We all make mistakes.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.500
Especially me.
If you got to change to make it right,

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.800
make it right.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.900
I feel it's the only way.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.500
I don't feel a need to play the whole
part in the entire movement.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.600
but, if you just raise your
family right,

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.200
if I just live righteously,
I be aight...

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.600
My whole life is dedicated
to change.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.500
I'm goin to Africa.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.200
Word?

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.500
Africa?

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.700
between you, me,...
the whole world.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.200
That's ill, son.
That's ill.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.500
What can I say...

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.500
Congratulations.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.500
Good luck on your trip
to the Motherland.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.400
Good lookin, Buns.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.300
I hope everything is right with
you and the Minister as well.

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.600
What you wan' me do with
the car and all that?

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:36.000
What you wanna me do
with all that?

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.400
I don't really need all that.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.500
Accept that as a gift.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.500
From to the heart.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.000
And remember...

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.000
Dope. Had to be secure to leave it
in that office.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:16.400
Is extremely important that
they found shit on the Minister's.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:35.500
Under no circunstances.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.900
You copy that?

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.500
Yeah, I copy that.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.300
You my nigga.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.500
Tee!

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.800
- Tee!
- I'm here, Sin.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.500
Why you sit over there?

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.100
What happened?

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:33.300
I went home, there's some
niggas in the house.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.300
They're lookin for you.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.500
He said his name was Sha...

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.200
But I think they
lookin for Tommy.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.500
- They touched you?
- No.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.600
I got scared.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500
But they left quietly.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:56.200
I was sitting here...

01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.500
They dead.

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.500
You gotta promise.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:06.500
You gotta promise me.
You just say fuck this shit.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.500
And just leave it alone.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.200
You got to swear that
you're not go lookin for them.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.500
I can't take this shit no more.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.500
We just do what you said...

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500
You forget about Tommy,
about all this shit.

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.500
I start thinkin about us.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.500
And split and go to Africa,
we just should go.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.500
We just should go.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.500
I don't know how you
can stay here.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.500
Shit got crazy every day.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.500
Me, my wife...

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.500
we'll be out.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.200
You goin to Africa
and stop fuckin with weed?

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.000
I don't even fuck with
no more chronic.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.200
I don't need none
of that shit again.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.300
You're a lucky nigga.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.100
Long-ass flight, too.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.500
I never comin back.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:05.500
Never comin back.
Word!

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500
My nigga.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.000
Sin, what's up, baby?

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.700
You lookin good, brother.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.400
Yo, what up, Black,
funny-ass nigga?

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.000
What's the deal?

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.800
Remember that shit from
the basement?

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.000
Take this, man!

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.000
Tee, I got shot.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:40.400
What?

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.500
This nigga shot me in my leg.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.500
I had to shot to this two other niggas.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.500
What?

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:52.200
The nigga that shot me.
I killed that nigga.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.500
Sin...

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.900
I don't give a fuck.
We still gon' go.

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:03.300
Nothin stop us from leavin.
I don't give a fuck no more.
We goin.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.100
Is Knowledge.

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.300
Damn.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.500
That nigga can't leave, son.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.300
I know where Tommy's bitch live at.

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.500
35, Westchester.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.500
I gon' go see that bitch.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.500
- For you, son.
- Get that bitch.

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.500
Bring that nigga on the front!

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.500
No doubt.

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:04.200
You are a beautiful people.

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:08.500
A people deserving an a saviour.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.200
A God who loves you
and I so much...

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500
that he'll---

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.500
climb a mountain
40 miles high.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.000
Just to save one of you!

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.500
I knew you were coming.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.500
So I sent everyone away...

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:04.700
because I believed my final moment
was at hand.

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.500
Before you pull that trigger,

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.500
and take my life,

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.500
I would like the chance to
tell you some things,

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:17.800
perhaps to think about
after I am gone.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.500
Don't worry about me stallin.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.500
My people have orders

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.900
to leave me to my studies
for another 15 minutes.

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.500
I will only take 5.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.500
Can you bear with me?

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.200
Will you?

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.100
Then make up your mind.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:41.500
Today marks the change of
not only a New Year,

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.000
but a new Millenium.
Take a look around.

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:46.500
The majority of the youth roam
the streets...

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.500
dealing in drugs, sex and violence,

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.500
thinking these things
have no real effect on life.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:59.200
Crimes without real punishment.
An uncaring, unfeeling generation...

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:01.500
without knowledge of self.

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:05.000
This is the future of our nation,
the future of our people.

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.300
Do you think hatred and evil
will go unpunished?

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.800
The world is now feeling the heat...

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.500
from flames it has kept burning
since the beginning of civilization.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500
You represent that fire.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.800
You and I...

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
are just a small part of God's plan.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:28.500
The evil men of this world have
applied every method possible...

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.200
to deceive its occupants.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:36.100
And each time with greater
success than anticipated.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.500
But no more.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:41.500
Tonight, with this new millennium,

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:45.600
God will begin to overcome
this evil.

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.900
I represent the truth
to the people.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:59.500
Without truth, nothing is sacred.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:02.500
The lie-that's what the
devil is all about.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.400
You know that,
that's why you're here.

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.500
What the hell?!

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:12.400
The truth is,
we all play a grave role...

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:15.000
in our own destruction.

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:19.100
Your money.
Your lifestyles.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.500
The things that people value and
covet so dearly...

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.900
are the bait that lures them
out of the light.

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.700
Turn over, bitch.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.500
Where the fuck is that
bitch-ass nigga?

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.500
Huh?

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:40.200
Through the love of others...
I have power

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:43.100
The truth gives me this.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:49.200
Those that fear me send you here,
here to murder all that I say.

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:55.800
They use what you fear
against you.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:00.500
Your fear of death,
your fear of imprisonment.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.900
Where in this world is anyone
safe from death?

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.500
You see the lies
you've been told?

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.000
The path you take is not
your own.

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.500
Now you turn around, bitch!

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.500
Punk-ass motherfucker!

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.500
Look what you did to me!

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.500
I hate you!

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:26.000
Have you ever thought about
how precious a life is?

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.400
How difficult it is to create?

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:34.000
How loosely and easily it has been
for you to take away?

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.500
Brother, help me.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.400
Help me to do what's right.

01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:42.600
Help me to stop the slaughter
of our children.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.500
Help me to put an end to the
disrespect and the dishonor...

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.500
of our most valuable resource:

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.500
the black woman.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.500
Help me put an end to the
destruction of the young mind...

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.500
through the use of drugs, alcohol.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:02.000
Help me to build up a population
of great thinkers.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.500
People who create change...

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.500
through thoughtfulness
and spirituality.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.500
Will you choose that truth?

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.500
Will you?

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.500
Will you choose the light over
the darkness?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.500
Once I found out the clock was ticking,
it's get the glock, I'mma stick him,

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:33.500
nah, kill 'em cause revenge is all a
nigga think about in the end,

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:37.500
but I'm goin' on a binge,
brother, to my sins.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.500
fuck you all, niggas!

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.700
Born by myself, die by myself.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:48.500
And if you don't know
what it's gon' be in the end...

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.500
T minus
3, 2, 1...

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.500
Amen.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:57.100
- Drop the gun!
- Hold it! Stay where you are

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:00.200
Will you choose life?

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.500
It's time.

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.600
It's time, man.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.500
It's time.

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:27.300
When I opened my eyes
I couldn't believe it.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.100
Africa for real!

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.500
I felt like I never really
see clouds before.

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:34.500
I felt like the sky was
a different color blue.

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.500
The trees different color green.

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.500
And the people too.
The people were beautiful.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:42.500
It felt right.
It was harmony.

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.500
Like I wasn't gone from home.

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.500
Everybody together.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.500
Me, Tionne, Kenya.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.500
It was like...

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.500
a whole new beginning.
