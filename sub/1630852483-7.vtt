00:53.680 --> 00:54.780
I know it was part of the operation,

but how could you not tell me
about the Crown Prince's bodyguards?

00:58.420 --> 01:00.490

the element of surprise.

You could have told me.

to chew before you swallow.

can you rub my back

05:50.480 --> 05:53.980
That is not what I meant.
He was earlier arrested

19:57.990 --> 19:59.230
Have you looked into it?

19:59.360 --> 20:01.030
The records

20:00.190 --> 20:04.060
[Hongseo: Death of a king,
royal family, noble, etc.]

20:01.630 --> 20:03.700
of when His Royal Highness
passed away disappeared,

20:03.760 --> 20:05.130
so we could not track it down.

20:07.330 --> 20:10.770
Fortunately, we were able to get our hands
on the prescription through a court lady

20:11.140 --> 20:12.670
who worked at the Crown Prince's Palace.

20:17.010 --> 20:20.110
White lotus and the horn of a rhinoceros
should not

20:20.180 --> 20:21.480
have been taken with aconite.

20:25.890 --> 20:28.760
One and a half don of aconite

20:30.120 --> 20:33.130
is too much to take every meal, is it not?

20:33.360 --> 20:36.130
So please find the answer

20:36.800 --> 20:38.130
to that question, my lord.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.100
I will at any cost.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.110
That...

20:46.140 --> 20:47.910
will be the least I can do.

21:05.660 --> 21:08.230
What? It already ended?

21:10.930 --> 21:12.030
How boring.

21:13.270 --> 21:14.300
Again.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.100
Run.

21:18.140 --> 21:19.310
Run!

21:28.020 --> 21:30.180
Catch her again. Go!

21:44.460 --> 21:46.670
Why are you alone? Where's Yuk-chil?

21:46.870 --> 21:49.540
I do not know what he is doing
nor where he is since earlier.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.980
What about you? Why are you alone?
Where is Gwang-soon?

21:55.540 --> 21:58.880
You are right.
I have not seen her since earlier either.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.000
Goo-pal, hurry up and go to bed.

22:16.060 --> 22:18.100
I will after I read
through the ledger more.

22:19.030 --> 22:20.170
I will then.

22:20.670 --> 22:23.770
Gosh, a day feels like three.

22:24.940 --> 22:26.440
-Good night.
-You too.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.620
Is this not...

23:03.380 --> 23:05.480
Who is there?

23:08.280 --> 23:09.580
Is someone there?

23:37.410 --> 23:38.550
Who is that?

23:39.180 --> 23:40.510
Is it Gwang-soon?

23:42.880 --> 23:43.980
Gwang-soon?

23:52.360 --> 23:53.890
Darn it.

23:59.570 --> 24:02.440
It was my mother-in-law.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.640
I know you must be tired, but do not let
your guards down even in the dark hours.

24:07.770 --> 24:08.880
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

24:14.410 --> 24:15.580
Where is she going?

24:18.050 --> 24:19.190
Why is she going in there?

24:22.420 --> 24:23.860
Where are you going?

24:39.440 --> 24:40.840
Where are you going?

24:41.140 --> 24:42.410
There are no tracks over there.

24:47.510 --> 24:48.680
Nor any lights.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.250
How will you come back if you get lost?

24:53.750 --> 24:54.820
Stop right there!

24:57.820 --> 24:59.690
Can you not hear me?

25:08.200 --> 25:09.300
[Is this not]

25:10.140 --> 25:11.300
[aconite?]

25:13.910 --> 25:15.210
[White lotus and the horn of a rhinoceros]

25:15.640 --> 25:18.680
[should not have been taken with aconite.]

25:30.190 --> 25:31.460
Mother-in-law!

25:33.190 --> 25:36.160
-What do you mean mother-in-law?
-Mother-in-law, it is me, Jo-yi!

25:36.460 --> 25:38.530
What? No!

25:40.500 --> 25:43.000
Hey, do not step on them.

25:46.540 --> 25:47.870
Mother-in-law!

25:52.950 --> 25:54.310
Mother-in-law!

25:55.320 --> 25:56.580
I told you not to step on them!

26:12.300 --> 26:13.330
I got you.

26:24.310 --> 26:25.880
Please do not kill me.

26:30.620 --> 26:31.650
It is over now.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.540
Goodness.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.740
So it is true you run into your worst
enemy at the worst place and time.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.780
Gosh, why was she there?

26:58.980 --> 27:01.550
How did she know of this place?

27:05.150 --> 27:07.120
Goodness.

27:08.490 --> 27:11.060
Gosh, it hurts.

27:11.860 --> 27:13.290
Oh, my.

27:14.430 --> 27:17.560
-Gosh.
-Mother-in-law! I caught you!

27:17.830 --> 27:20.170
Let go of me, you wench!

27:22.800 --> 27:24.170
Goodness.

27:24.740 --> 27:28.440
It all broke because of you. It all did.

27:28.510 --> 27:30.840
What did I do?

27:31.180 --> 27:34.580
Darn it. What do I do?

27:34.850 --> 27:35.920
Are you all right?

27:38.320 --> 27:39.950
Goodness me.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.120
Inspector Ra, it is you.

27:43.420 --> 27:46.430
Is this one of the places
you are investigating?

27:47.460 --> 27:48.530
Investigate what?

27:51.360 --> 27:53.270
Why would you be here of all places?

28:02.810 --> 28:05.510
Why are you doing this to me?

28:07.010 --> 28:09.720
Why will you not let me

28:09.780 --> 28:12.250
find something to eat for my son?

28:12.890 --> 28:14.150
Your son?

28:16.660 --> 28:17.960
Speak the truth.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.630
This is where Chu-han is.

28:29.570 --> 28:30.900
What could he be doing here?

28:31.540 --> 28:34.840
Mother, do you even know where you are?

28:35.280 --> 28:36.510
Do you have any idea how dangerous--

28:36.580 --> 28:39.110
What can I do when he owes people?

28:39.180 --> 28:42.080
Do you really think Chu-han
would want to be dragged up here

28:42.150 --> 28:44.380
and be forced into slavery?

28:46.020 --> 28:47.050
Goodness.

28:49.420 --> 28:52.460
Are you saying
he provides labor at the hideout?

28:52.990 --> 28:54.660
No, not exactly.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.300
Whatever. I do not know much.

29:00.100 --> 29:03.300
From what I hear,

29:03.370 --> 29:05.940
this place is inhabited
by leopards and foxes.

29:06.610 --> 29:08.940
My gosh! And wild boars.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.080
We should head back down for now.
You will follow us.

29:13.150 --> 29:15.680
No, I do not want to. I will not.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.620
But it is dangerous here!

29:17.680 --> 29:19.590
I cannot leave.

29:19.650 --> 29:21.290
It is dark out here,

29:21.390 --> 29:24.160
so what if you run into trouble?

29:24.220 --> 29:26.760
-But my Chu-han...
-Quiet!

29:36.370 --> 29:37.470
How was your nap?

29:52.450 --> 29:54.290
I am sure that explains where you are.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.460
Now, tell me.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.530
What is your relationship
with Chief Clerk Hong?

29:59.830 --> 30:01.130
Why were you there?

30:01.830 --> 30:03.230
I do not know him at all.

30:04.230 --> 30:06.070
I have nothing to do with him.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.970
Then why were you guarding their cell?

30:11.370 --> 30:14.340
The secret royal inspector
arrested Hong Seok-ki.

30:17.110 --> 30:19.280
Does that make you
the inspector's assistant?

30:20.250 --> 30:21.850
The inspector's assistant?

30:22.320 --> 30:23.350
I am clueless, my lord.

30:23.420 --> 30:25.550
Never have I met a secret royal inspector.

30:27.650 --> 30:29.190
Then why were you there

30:29.260 --> 30:31.220
when you do not know either of them?

30:43.640 --> 30:46.610
Just tell me who you are.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.520
Tell me.

30:59.690 --> 31:02.190
I know you are working
with the secret royal inspector.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.460
Darn it. Dunk her.

31:08.030 --> 31:09.960
The order came from Lord Park Tae-seo!

31:17.940 --> 31:19.170
Lord Park Tae-seo,

31:19.770 --> 31:22.180
who has command over the area,

31:22.880 --> 31:24.010
captured

31:24.110 --> 31:26.710
Hong Seok-ki before the inspector could.

31:26.780 --> 31:30.250
It was his orders I was following.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.290
Tae-seo's orders?

31:36.820 --> 31:37.820
Darn it.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.430
Could he have not killed
Hong Seok-ki sooner

31:41.490 --> 31:43.200
and saved me the trip?

31:45.670 --> 31:47.000
He is no help at all.

31:53.940 --> 31:57.380
Then, you must know where the hideout is.

32:02.550 --> 32:03.720
Lead the way.

32:03.780 --> 32:07.020
But Inspector Ra and Jo-yi
are still there.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.890
-Do you not want to?
-I will take you there!

32:12.390 --> 32:15.630
I know the hideout
where Lord Park's mine is.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.700
-His mine?
-Yes.

32:19.500 --> 32:21.000
I will take you there.

32:22.870 --> 32:24.440
He has a mine?

32:26.740 --> 32:28.410
I am impressed, Tae-seo.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.180
Bring her up.

32:54.230 --> 32:55.200
Goodness.

33:25.060 --> 33:26.470
Look how dirty those are.

33:26.970 --> 33:28.940
If I had known,
I would have washed them too.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.240
If you take them off,

33:31.300 --> 33:33.040
I will wash them right now.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.570
They will be dry by sunrise.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.380
It seems

33:37.610 --> 33:39.780
too soon in our relationship

33:39.850 --> 33:42.850
to be letting each other smell our feet.

33:43.950 --> 33:46.290
[No, I will not!]

33:46.390 --> 33:48.090
[Where are you dragging me?]

33:48.150 --> 33:50.960
Who on earth could be interrupting me?

33:51.020 --> 33:53.130
[No, I will not go in there.]

33:53.190 --> 33:55.560
[-Stop this!]
-Is that not Inspector Ra and Jo-yi?

33:55.630 --> 33:57.660
No, let go of me!

33:57.730 --> 34:00.130
Experience has taught me

34:00.200 --> 34:02.400
that not going to him
is the wiser decision.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.470
I am sure that is official business.

34:08.909 --> 34:11.139
An educated man like him
would not kill a woman.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.179
Or maybe he will.

34:19.889 --> 34:21.550
Just kill me instead.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.219
Take off your socks.

34:23.290 --> 34:25.389
-I would rather die.
-Come on.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.159
Hold on a second.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.100
Sorry. I must have pulled down your pants.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.630
Goodness me.

34:34.770 --> 34:38.100
I would rather die, my lord.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.710
Goodness.

34:41.170 --> 34:43.340
My gosh.

34:44.380 --> 34:45.380
Gosh.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.480
What is your son
actually doing in the woods?

34:49.020 --> 34:52.489
Probably every physical labor
they are forcing him into.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.290
He was dragged here because
he could not pay his gambling debt.

34:57.960 --> 35:01.160
What about you then?
Why were you dragged here too?

35:01.960 --> 35:06.430
Just think about it.
Strangers were dragging Chu-han away,

35:06.500 --> 35:08.600
so how could I not accompany him?

35:10.100 --> 35:12.270
I followed him here of my own accord

35:12.340 --> 35:14.140
hoping to work in the kitchen.

35:15.340 --> 35:16.710
Is that why...

35:20.910 --> 35:23.950
When will he start
taking responsibility for his own life

35:24.020 --> 35:26.790
and stop dragging you down with him?

35:43.200 --> 35:46.210
Then tell me. What exactly is up there?

35:47.070 --> 35:50.440
That is something I do not know.

35:51.380 --> 35:55.010
There is a mine
and something is being dug up.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.290
It is not like I can go up there myself.

35:59.890 --> 36:02.420
Only those authorized can.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.090
Halfway up the mountain,

36:07.760 --> 36:11.160
I would leave him a rice ball and...

36:11.930 --> 36:13.200
[It is where the grain paid as taxes]

36:13.270 --> 36:14.600
extorted by Ji Maeng-soo,
the head of the hideout,

36:14.670 --> 36:16.800
and the government officials of
the three provinces, are stored.

36:17.140 --> 36:19.410
The money earned by selling these items
and the bootleg wine they make there

36:19.470 --> 36:21.870
throughout the entire nation
is what helps operate

36:22.540 --> 36:23.780
Baekgwiryeong,

36:23.840 --> 36:26.280
Park Tae-seo's silver workshop.
That is what I heard.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.310
Baekgwiryeong silver workshop?

36:28.380 --> 36:31.280
Yes. They say silver is extracted
from the silver ores

36:31.580 --> 36:33.150
dug from those mines

36:33.220 --> 36:34.790
at the Baekgwiryeong silver workshop.

36:36.020 --> 36:38.560
-The silver workshop.
-My Chu-han

36:38.620 --> 36:40.930
comes to collect it when he can!

36:40.990 --> 36:44.360
Is that why you were hiding there
despite the commotion?

36:44.660 --> 36:49.770
And because of this,
Chu-han will have to skip his dinner.

36:49.870 --> 36:53.370
My sweet boy will be waiting for me!

36:53.640 --> 36:55.210
Your son is a prisoner there,

36:55.680 --> 36:57.680
so you must have at least heard something.

36:59.650 --> 37:01.010
Please tell me whatever you know.

37:02.780 --> 37:07.920
What I heard is that
he keeps the fire going.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.460
The fire?

37:10.520 --> 37:14.590
The ores that are mined are taken
to Baekgwiryeong silver workshop

37:14.790 --> 37:16.230
where they are melted down.

37:16.300 --> 37:20.600
He says that he has
to keep the fire going all day.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.590
Let us go.

37:46.660 --> 37:50.460
[There is a secluded guard post
above the silver workshop.]

37:50.800 --> 37:53.370
[I heard the headman]

37:53.430 --> 37:56.040
[goes there very often.]

38:15.620 --> 38:17.890
Do you know how many reside there?

38:19.030 --> 38:20.490
The rogues who guard the headman.

38:21.690 --> 38:25.100
They do not need to guard him
when he is there.

38:25.460 --> 38:29.100
It is like a fortress due to the terrain
and the location.

38:29.800 --> 38:30.900
Also,

38:31.800 --> 38:35.010
I heard there is something that explodes
when you step on it.

38:46.150 --> 38:47.890
What are they trying to hide

38:49.360 --> 38:51.360
that they would steal tax grain
and even tributes?

38:54.130 --> 38:56.800
What is their ultimate goal?

38:59.770 --> 39:01.830
-You must leave this place at once.
-What?

39:02.540 --> 39:06.340
It is illegal to abduct and detain someone
even if it is about a gambling debt.

39:06.870 --> 39:08.510
I will make sure they are punished.

39:18.220 --> 39:20.290
Will you please

39:20.350 --> 39:23.890
save my son, Chu-han?

39:23.990 --> 39:25.790
-We will.
-Thank you.

39:26.830 --> 39:27.960
Thank you.

39:30.630 --> 39:31.700
Mother.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.750
Take this.

39:52.220 --> 39:53.250
What about you?

39:55.450 --> 39:58.860
I want to be a good daughter, but I do not
have a mother of my own to look after.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.800
Be safe.

40:06.830 --> 40:07.970
The road is rough,

40:09.200 --> 40:10.440
so make sure you walk slowly.

40:14.870 --> 40:17.180
Why would you give me money?

40:24.220 --> 40:27.420
You gave me plenty last time.

40:31.190 --> 40:33.190
Just keep it,

40:34.460 --> 40:37.100
so you can give it to your mother
when you meet her again.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.500
You be safe too.

40:44.140 --> 40:47.240
Although you are smart, so I am sure
you can take care of yourself.

40:53.550 --> 40:57.320
My poor son, Chu-han...

40:59.490 --> 41:01.220
I am his mother, but I feel so helpless.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.390
Oh, dear.

41:04.460 --> 41:07.090
This is all my fault.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.900
♫ When March ♫

41:10.660 --> 41:12.800
♫ Comes around ♫

41:14.170 --> 41:16.840
♫ The dead tree ♫

41:17.000 --> 41:19.610
♫ On the hill behind the house ♫

41:19.810 --> 41:22.510
♫ Will grow new leaves ♫

41:22.610 --> 41:25.140
♫ And flowers ♫

42:05.550 --> 42:07.850
-My lord.
-You woke up, at last.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.160
Where are you going?

42:14.290 --> 42:17.060
The sun has come up, so I must locate
the entrance to Baekgwiryeong.

42:17.430 --> 42:20.730
To get the army involved,
I must at least locate the mine.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.000
But it is still so early.

42:23.070 --> 42:25.170
-Okay, we will get ready quickly.
-No.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.410
It will be faster if I go alone.

42:27.610 --> 42:29.510
No. We must go with you.

42:29.580 --> 42:32.210
What if there is a trap?
It is too dangerous to go there alone.

42:32.810 --> 42:36.520
That is all just what
Jang Pat-soon overheard.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.680
Unless she saw them with her own eyes,

42:39.050 --> 42:41.190
it is more likely
that such traps do not even exist.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.330
No way. You cannot go on your own.

42:46.390 --> 42:49.330
I will run to the nearest local office
and ask for assistance.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.030
-Just write a letter--
-It is of no use.

42:51.100 --> 42:52.730
All the officials are in on it.

42:53.270 --> 42:55.570
-Then take Yuk-chil and Goo-pal--
-There is no need.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.570
They will be a nuisance.
I can manage on my own.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.900
Do not be so stubborn.

42:58.970 --> 43:01.110
-To ensure your safety--
-Goodness!

43:01.610 --> 43:02.840
Why must you make such a fuss?

43:02.940 --> 43:04.410
I will just see where it is and return.

43:06.210 --> 43:08.650
What is it? Are you that worried
for my safety?

43:08.750 --> 43:10.080
Yes. I mean, no.

43:10.420 --> 43:12.480
It is not that. I just meant...

43:13.990 --> 43:17.220
This is about me. I am worried myself.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.630
I have looked death in the face
countless times

43:19.690 --> 43:20.960
since meeting you.

43:21.030 --> 43:23.830
How many times have I found myself
in a predicament that was uncalled for?

43:23.900 --> 43:25.700
That is why I will go alone.

43:27.230 --> 43:30.200
If that is what you say,
allow me to tag along.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.670
No. You should stay here

43:33.770 --> 43:35.710
and look for the ledger with Gwang-soon.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.610
That is how you can help me.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.150
No, you cannot go alone.

43:42.750 --> 43:45.020
My lord. What about us, then?

43:48.550 --> 43:49.790
I have a job for you two.

43:53.360 --> 43:56.360
I must submit a report
on this illegal field as soon as I can.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.960
-I need you to...
-He will not make us measure it.

43:59.060 --> 44:00.300
Measure it for me.

44:01.730 --> 44:03.600
From that point all the way over there

44:04.100 --> 44:05.840
to that point up there.

44:06.270 --> 44:07.710
Darn it, you have got to be kidding me.

44:08.270 --> 44:10.480
-I almost cursed just now.
-I did.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.440
-What?
-What? What is it?

44:12.510 --> 44:13.880
Are you dropping the honorifics now?

44:15.510 --> 44:17.480
Well, he cursed at you.

44:17.650 --> 44:19.490
Wait, you are dropping the honorifics too?

44:20.250 --> 44:21.350
No, not at all.

44:21.590 --> 44:24.020
So? What do you want us to do?

44:24.090 --> 44:25.590
Measure this entire field?

44:26.060 --> 44:27.430
Ouch! That hurts!

44:41.510 --> 44:42.570
Hey.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.810
Are you sure this is the right way?

44:50.620 --> 44:52.320
We are almost there.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.160
[What is this?]

45:05.100 --> 45:07.800
[If we go that way,
we will run into Lord Yi-eon.]

45:10.770 --> 45:11.870
It is this way.

45:15.270 --> 45:16.380
Hey!

45:22.580 --> 45:25.320
What are you doing? Why are you
suddenly taking a different turn?

45:27.090 --> 45:28.220
Are you sure about this?

45:28.720 --> 45:30.760
Yes, sir. I was confused.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.890
This is the right way.

45:56.380 --> 45:58.980
This must be the right way indeed.
Let us keep going.

46:20.170 --> 46:25.780
[Tavern]

46:33.050 --> 46:34.520
Senior Secretary!

46:37.890 --> 46:40.530
-Pat-soon?
-So it is you!

46:40.860 --> 46:45.130
Goodness, Senior secretary!
What brings you all the way to this town?

46:47.770 --> 46:49.640
Are you not spoiling me too much

46:49.700 --> 46:54.910
by giving me such a warm hug
whenever we meet?

47:00.050 --> 47:01.280
Oh, my!

47:04.220 --> 47:05.250
Let go!

47:05.650 --> 47:07.150
Senior secretary?

47:07.350 --> 47:10.490
What if others hear you call me that?

47:10.560 --> 47:11.790
Why?

47:11.860 --> 47:14.590
If I cannot call the senior secretary,
the senior secretary,

47:14.660 --> 47:17.000
-what am I supposed to...
-Quiet!

47:18.500 --> 47:21.400
But why are you here?

47:22.800 --> 47:25.370
I did hear that you and your son
were sold off due to his gambling debt.

47:26.370 --> 47:27.470
Is this the place?

47:27.540 --> 47:30.510
Do not even start with that story.

47:30.740 --> 47:34.010
I was caught red-handed by Inspector Ra,

47:34.710 --> 47:37.120
so I left first.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.290
Inspector who?

47:40.350 --> 47:44.190
You know that man
who made my son a divorced man

47:44.260 --> 47:46.830
and poked around Gyehwa Valley.

47:46.890 --> 47:49.560
You mean...

47:51.560 --> 47:52.900
Where

47:53.930 --> 47:56.240
is he right now? Here?

47:56.900 --> 47:59.340
Is he here right now?

47:59.400 --> 48:01.710
Not here. Up there.

48:01.770 --> 48:04.210
He is at the hideout up there.

48:04.580 --> 48:06.350
Hey.

48:11.550 --> 48:14.450
We met again because we are alive.

48:15.020 --> 48:16.260
And if we stay alive,

48:18.390 --> 48:19.860
we will see each other again one day.

48:29.870 --> 48:31.470
When will that be?

48:41.810 --> 48:42.850
Gosh.

48:43.750 --> 48:45.280
The inspector is at the hideout?

48:45.550 --> 48:46.850
Then what do I do?

48:47.450 --> 48:49.190
Even the chief clerk
of marine transportation is dead.

48:49.250 --> 48:52.060
So why must I risk my life on this?

48:52.790 --> 48:56.360
If worse comes to worst,
I might be falsely charged with murder.

48:59.530 --> 49:00.630
Should I

49:01.900 --> 49:03.100
report it?

49:33.100 --> 49:35.500
A man like him is the worst.

49:35.570 --> 49:36.970
He does as he pleases,
does not listen to others,

49:37.040 --> 49:38.400
and makes others worry.

49:38.470 --> 49:40.470
What are you mumbling about?

49:40.540 --> 49:42.240
Some might think you are his wife.

49:43.380 --> 49:44.710
His wife, my foot!

49:45.110 --> 49:46.780
I am simply...

49:48.910 --> 49:50.380
You see...

49:54.250 --> 49:57.860
Right. I simply want to catch and punish

49:57.920 --> 49:59.790
those bad guys who killed Bo-ri.

49:59.860 --> 50:02.260
And to do so, I need Inspector Ra.

50:02.330 --> 50:05.230
That is why I am angry at the inspector
who only does as he pleases.

50:05.300 --> 50:06.830
I get it.

50:06.900 --> 50:08.400
For now, let us find the ledger first.

50:08.470 --> 50:11.740
We will only find the culprit
after we find that ledger. Am I not right?

50:11.800 --> 50:14.740
Listen. I hate the delay.

50:14.810 --> 50:17.410
And I hate the fact
that I am getting misunderstood even more.

50:17.480 --> 50:19.110
-All right.
-So,

50:19.180 --> 50:21.480
I cannot help
but get angry at such Inspector Ra!

50:21.550 --> 50:23.380
-I am getting angry too!
-Right?

50:23.450 --> 50:25.450
He never listens to anyone!

50:30.320 --> 50:32.220
[Look carefully]

50:32.290 --> 50:35.360
[for what goods were mainly traded,
the names of the traders,]

50:35.960 --> 50:38.860
[the government office seal,
and any names that ring a bell.]

50:44.470 --> 50:49.680
[Brokerage Ledger]

50:45.840 --> 50:49.980
Seeing as they traded genuine products,
this must be a brokerage ledger.

50:51.140 --> 50:53.050
This is a slave transaction ledger.

50:53.110 --> 50:54.750
Judging by the names written on here.

50:55.350 --> 50:56.950
Those rotten jerks.

50:57.020 --> 50:59.790
They did every bad thing they could
possibly do with the government officials.

50:59.920 --> 51:02.520
It has the names of the government
officials and their office, right?

51:02.850 --> 51:05.320
Yes. With this, we will be able
to arrest all officials

51:05.390 --> 51:06.760
who worked with Cha Mal-jong.

51:07.090 --> 51:09.560
Gwang-soon, look through ledgers
that are in Chinese characters.

51:09.630 --> 51:11.500
I will look into those in Korean.

51:29.050 --> 51:30.820
How did you learn how to read and write?

51:30.880 --> 51:32.520
I could not even find
"The Thousand-Character Classic."

51:35.620 --> 51:37.560
You see...

51:37.660 --> 51:39.960
You are amazing.
You kept studying from time to time.

51:40.630 --> 51:42.890
Yes, I did.

51:43.700 --> 51:45.560
Then where are you from?

51:45.630 --> 51:48.030
From your dialect, you do not seem
to be from Chungcheong Province.

51:49.470 --> 51:51.800
I... You know...

51:52.200 --> 51:54.110
I was born in Gyeongsang Province,

51:54.170 --> 51:56.240
but came from Hanyang.

51:59.010 --> 52:00.080
Hanyang?

52:00.380 --> 52:02.910
Gosh, then you must know
about Hanyang really well.

52:02.980 --> 52:05.250
I have never once
been to Hanyang in my life.

52:05.880 --> 52:08.550
Is it true you get played
in front of your eyes in Hanyang?

52:08.620 --> 52:10.690
Even if you have your eyes wide open,

52:10.860 --> 52:11.860
you would get played...

52:13.190 --> 52:16.730
If your hometown is Gyeongsang Province,
how did you come here from Hanyang?

52:20.130 --> 52:21.370
You see...

52:27.670 --> 52:31.180
Well, I do not know why I am here either.

52:31.940 --> 52:34.110
I was going to go to Hanyang
after my divorce,

52:34.180 --> 52:35.610
but I got involved with Inspector Ra.

52:35.680 --> 52:38.050
I have no idea what I am doing
inside this mountain!

52:39.750 --> 52:42.550
But Bo-ri weighs on my mind,
so I cannot just leave.

52:43.720 --> 52:45.120
You never know

52:45.190 --> 52:47.630
what will happen in life, right?

52:59.040 --> 53:01.210
-The tax grain ledger!
-Yes, that!

53:01.270 --> 53:04.510
We will be able to find the real culprit
who killed Bo-ri with that ledger.

53:04.580 --> 53:06.880
But!

53:10.480 --> 53:12.380
Ledgers regarding tax grain
are nowhere to be found.

53:13.850 --> 53:16.560
Maybe that jerk Cha Mal-jong
already took it.

53:17.060 --> 53:19.720
Wait, it could be mixed among these.

53:19.790 --> 53:22.130
So let us carefully look through these,

53:22.490 --> 53:25.300
-then search through the hideout place.
-Right. Let us do that, Gwang-soon.

53:25.360 --> 53:27.370
These are in Chinese characters,
so you should read them.

53:28.170 --> 53:30.670
I have much more to read, Jo-yi.

53:30.740 --> 53:32.470
I know.
This is in Chinese characters as well.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.910
Gosh, how far are we going up?

54:15.380 --> 54:16.510
Goodness.

54:21.620 --> 54:22.650
Gosh.

54:32.600 --> 54:33.630
Darn it.

54:38.440 --> 54:41.070
Darn it! Let go!

54:47.610 --> 54:48.710
Darn it.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.760
This is not even a path.

55:04.830 --> 55:07.200
No one will come.
So why are you setting up a trap?

55:07.270 --> 55:08.600
The inspector is down there.

55:08.670 --> 55:11.640
Set it up everywhere,
regardless of whether it is a path or not,

55:11.700 --> 55:13.240
so that he cannot step a foot in here.

55:13.710 --> 55:15.470
We need to buy time
until the silver hardens.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.480
You really are meticulous.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.710
It is better to bury it
than to get it stolen by others.

55:23.010 --> 55:24.450
No one can imagine

55:24.520 --> 55:27.390
what you went through
to dig up those silver mines.

55:38.100 --> 55:41.000
You jerk!

55:41.070 --> 55:42.330
It works pretty well.

55:43.030 --> 55:45.370
Set up as many as you can
as close to each other as possible.

55:46.570 --> 55:49.170
So that he turns into a hedgehog
the moment he steps inside

55:49.710 --> 55:51.440
from whichever direction.

55:54.210 --> 55:55.480
You...

55:55.950 --> 55:58.780
How about you become a hedgehog?
Come over here.

55:59.020 --> 56:01.920
Come over here, you jerk!

56:06.390 --> 56:08.960
You should get on with your business
if you are busy.

56:09.030 --> 56:10.330
I will do it.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.230
Rub some aconite on the tip of the arrow.

56:16.170 --> 56:19.740
He is serious when it comes
to killing the inspector.

56:21.840 --> 56:24.380
But is it not better to catch him alive?

56:25.280 --> 56:27.480
We are not inspector hunters.

56:27.550 --> 56:29.580
Should we really be killing
every single one of them?

56:33.250 --> 56:34.350
Goodness.

57:44.190 --> 57:46.120
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

57:46.190 --> 57:48.060
[Underage actors were managed with care.]

58:03.170 --> 58:05.640
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

58:06.140 --> 58:07.580
[Does it not fascinate you?]

58:07.650 --> 58:11.120
[More people than usual
are heading up the mountain today.]

58:11.180 --> 58:13.650
[How is this my fault?]

58:13.750 --> 58:16.290
You will regret it.
You should check with the officials first!

58:16.520 --> 58:18.190
[Is this not gunpowder?]

58:18.260 --> 58:20.290
[They must not be your average bandits.]

58:20.390 --> 58:22.060
