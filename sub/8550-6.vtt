O.K., BUT
I'M NOT HOME.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.940
WALDO, COME
TO THE WITNESS STAND.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.515
STATE YOUR NAME.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.051
ILLINOIS.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.728
NO.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.730
STATE YOUR NAME,

14:57.797 --> 15:00.100
NOT NAME YOUR STATE.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.639
OH. WALDO FALDO.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.175
FROM ILLINOIS.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.712
NOW, MR. FALDO,

15:12.779 --> 15:15.582
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TELL THE COURT
YOUR EXPERIENCES

15:15.648 --> 15:17.917
WITH PABLO?

15:17.985 --> 15:22.022
PABLO WAS A KIND
AND GENTLE CREATURE.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.460
WHEN I WAS WITH HIM,

15:27.527 --> 15:29.029
I FELT...

15:30.530 --> 15:32.399
I FELT...

15:36.036 --> 15:39.439
"I FELT LIKE I WAS ONE
WITH THE BEOSPEAR."

15:41.208 --> 15:43.043
PER-PER-PERHAPS...

15:43.110 --> 15:47.014
PERHAPS YOU MEAN
BIOSPHERE?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.916
O.K. COOL.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.685
GREAT. NOTHING
FURTHER. BYE.

15:52.752 --> 15:56.823
NOT YET. WALDO, IS
SOMETHING WRITTEN
ON YOUR ARM?

15:56.889 --> 15:59.159
ONLY THE STUFF
STEVE TOLD ME TO SAY.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.132
THANK YOU.
YOU MAY GO.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.168
NO THANKS.
I WENT BEFORE I LEFT THE HOUSE.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.407
I MEANT Y-YOU
MAY GO TO YOUR SEAT.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.176
OH. COOL.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.083
DON'T GLOAT, DREAMBOAT.

16:23.150 --> 16:27.254
THAT AIN'T ALL SHE WROTE.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.390
YOUR HONOR,
I WOULD LIKE TO CALL
MY LAST WITNESS--

16:30.457 --> 16:32.059
EDWARD WINSLOW.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.097
EDDIE, WHEN YOU WERE 7,
DID YOU HAVE A PET?

16:37.164 --> 16:40.167
YEAH. I HAD
A HAMSTER--
MR. FLUFFKINS.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.501
DO YOU REMEMBER
ONE DAY

16:41.568 --> 16:44.771
WHEN MR. FLUFFKINS
ESCAPED FROM HIS CAGE?

16:44.837 --> 16:47.140
UH, YEAH.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.310
UM, I WAS CLEANING
MY ROOM,

16:50.377 --> 16:53.713
AND I NOTICED
HE WAS GONE.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.915
DAD WAS IN
THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.085
HE SAID HE HADN'T
SEEN MY HAMSTER.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.221
AND YOU BELIEVED HIM.

17:01.288 --> 17:05.525
WELL, YEAH.
I MEAN, HE'S MY DAD.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.527
ANYWAY...

17:07.594 --> 17:11.931
I STARTED
TAKING CLOTHES
OUT OF THE DRYER,

17:11.998 --> 17:14.467
AND...AND, UM...

17:14.534 --> 17:16.103
AND...

17:16.703 --> 17:20.140
AND WHAT, EDDIE?

17:20.207 --> 17:23.443
THERE WAS MR. FLUFFKINS
STUCK IN THE LINT TRAP.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.981
WAS HE...DEAD?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.450
Y-YES.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.321
BUT HE WAS
WRINKLE-FREE AND
SPRINGTIME FRESH.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.555
OH!

17:35.622 --> 17:36.689
[SOBBING]

17:39.726 --> 17:41.128
OH, EDDIE.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.064
NOW--NOW, I KNOW
THE MEMORY STILL HURTS,

17:45.132 --> 17:49.636
BUT I HAVE TO ASK
ONE MORE QUESTION.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.404
NOW, WAS IT POSSIBLE

17:51.471 --> 17:55.175
FOR AN ITTY-BITTY,
LITTLE HAMSTER

17:55.242 --> 17:58.678
TO GET INTO
A TALL, BIG DRYER

17:58.745 --> 18:00.747
ALL BY HIMSELF?

18:00.813 --> 18:04.351
OR WOULDN'T HE NEED
A LITTLE BOOST?

18:06.586 --> 18:07.854
CARL, SIT DOWN.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.855
SIT DOWN.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.922
ORDER!

18:09.989 --> 18:11.491
ORDER!

18:11.558 --> 18:13.493
ONE MORE OUTBURST
LIKE THAT,

18:13.560 --> 18:17.264
AND I'LL CLEAR
THE COURTROOM
AND PUT ON A RERUN.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.603
I REST MY CASE,
YOUR HONOR.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.939
YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

18:27.006 --> 18:30.310
MISS WINSLOW, DO YOU HAVE
A CLOSING STATEMENT?

18:30.377 --> 18:34.113
MY CLIENT
WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK
ON HIS OWN BEHALF.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.056
YOUR HONOR...

18:44.123 --> 18:46.626
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

18:48.995 --> 18:52.131
IT WAS JUST
A STUPID BUG.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.644
THANK YOU.
MR. URKEL.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.286
NOW, WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE,

19:13.353 --> 19:16.856
A BUG OR A FRIEND?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.628
PABLO WAS MY FRIEND,

19:21.694 --> 19:25.097
AND CARL WINSLOW
WAS MY FRIEND,

19:25.164 --> 19:30.603
AND, WELL, WHEN CARL
SQUISHED PABLO...

19:30.670 --> 19:33.973
WELL, HE KILLED
TWO FRIENDSHIPS,

19:34.040 --> 19:37.610
BUT ONE OF THOSE FRIENDSHIPS
COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED

19:37.677 --> 19:40.179
IF CARL HERE...

19:40.247 --> 19:42.982
WELL, HAD ONLY FOUND IT
IN HIS HEART

19:43.049 --> 19:45.184
TO SAY, "I'M SORRY."

19:49.356 --> 19:50.723
[GAVEL POUNDS]

19:50.790 --> 19:54.394
I'LL BE BACK
IN A MOMENT
WITH MY DECISION.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.106
UH, STEVE...

20:07.173 --> 20:08.708
YES?

20:11.177 --> 20:13.913
DID YOU REALLY MEAN
WHAT YOU SAID?

20:13.980 --> 20:16.349
DID I KILL
OUR FRIENDSHIP?

20:16.416 --> 20:19.819
WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY
IN INTENSIVE CARE.

20:22.822 --> 20:26.826
WELL, I--I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.361
WELL, ME NEITHER,

20:28.428 --> 20:30.663
BUT A REAL FRIEND
WOULDN'T KEEP
REFERRING TO PABLO

20:30.730 --> 20:32.932
AS A STUPID BUG.

20:32.999 --> 20:37.504
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF IT'S IMPORTANT
TO YOU,

20:37.570 --> 20:40.707
IT IS NOT
A STUPID BUG,

20:40.773 --> 20:44.377
SO I GUESS IT'S UP
TO ME TO APOLOGIZE.

20:46.313 --> 20:49.782
THAT'S ALL I EVER
WANTED TO HEAR.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.359
BUDS AGAIN,
BIG GUY?

20:59.426 --> 21:01.628
BUDS AGAIN.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.430
I'LL EVEN BUY
YOU A NEW BUG.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.532
UH, NO, CARL.
IT'S TOO SOON.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.266
OH.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.740
O.K.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.011
WELL...

21:19.078 --> 21:23.282
I HAVE, UH,
CONSIDERED THIS CASE
CAREFULLY,

21:23.350 --> 21:24.951
AND I HAVE REACHED
A DECISION.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.321
UH, NEVER MIND,
YOUR HONOR.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.522
NEVER MIND?

21:29.589 --> 21:32.625
NO, SIR.
WE'VE SETTLED IT
OURSELVES.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.227
WHAT?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.664
BUT I'M THE JUDGE.

21:37.730 --> 21:42.168
IT'S WHAT I DO.
I JUDGE THINGS.

21:42.234 --> 21:45.372
I--WELL, W-W-WOULD YOU
AT LEAST LIKE TO HEAR
WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID?

21:45.438 --> 21:46.939
NO.
NO.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.576
THANK YOU.
NOT REALLY.
IT'S NOT EVEN NECESSARY.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.084
YES!
YES!
