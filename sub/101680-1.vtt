Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:31.542 --> 12:33.085
Well, good night, Gertrude!

12:33.169 --> 12:35.045
Good night, fryer.
Good night, patty.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.047
Good night, pickles. Mwah!

12:38.257 --> 12:39.592
[door shuts]

12:45.639 --> 12:47.641
[lid bangs, rattles]

12:48.851 --> 12:50.853
Good night, SpongeBob.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.397
Hello, Krabby Patty!

12:57.234 --> 12:58.736
And now…

13:11.874 --> 13:13.751
Just got to get it.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.590
[cackling] Yes!

13:19.673 --> 13:20.591
Wait, wait. No.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.301
No. No!

13:22.885 --> 13:25.262
Stupid coin-operated…

13:27.556 --> 13:29.892
Come here, come here…

13:29.975 --> 13:31.185
Oh!

13:33.437 --> 13:35.105
Bingo!

13:36.565 --> 13:38.859
Come to Papa.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.154
In just a few minutes
the formula will be mine!

13:42.238 --> 13:44.281
[beeping]

13:45.783 --> 13:47.868
[printer whirring]

13:56.210 --> 13:59.713
Yes! Krabs's fast-food empire will fail

13:59.797 --> 14:02.049
and I will rule Bikini Bottom,

14:02.132 --> 14:04.552
as its new slop king!

14:04.635 --> 14:06.971
[guffawing]

14:10.140 --> 14:12.017
-I knew it!
-[yelling]

14:14.520 --> 14:16.105
[Plankton groans]

14:16.188 --> 14:18.649
-The formula!
-I knew I left my keys in here.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.025
Oh, silly me.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.903
Come here, you! [grunting]

14:22.987 --> 14:26.699
Huh. No keys. That's weird.
Where could they be?

14:26.782 --> 14:28.367
Yes! No.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.871
Ooh! Ow!

14:31.954 --> 14:33.998
[SpongeBob] Keys, where are you?

14:34.081 --> 14:36.250
-Come on, show me keys!
-[screams]

14:37.751 --> 14:39.962
[gasps] Gotcha!

14:41.088 --> 14:42.006
Ha-ha!

14:42.089 --> 14:43.007
[whirring]

14:43.841 --> 14:45.217
No. No!

14:45.301 --> 14:47.136
[screams]

14:48.846 --> 14:50.180
Ow.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.474
They were in my pocket
the whole time!

14:52.558 --> 14:53.517
[laughs]

14:54.560 --> 14:57.187
[Karen] It's SpongeBob who's the problem.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.772
I get it.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.320
[narrator] Meanwhile, at the palace
of King Poseidon…

15:05.487 --> 15:07.781
…ruler of the Seven Seas.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.244
[Poseidon] Chancellor!

15:14.163 --> 15:16.165
-Chancellor!
-[Chancellor humming]

15:16.999 --> 15:18.542
Chancellor!

15:19.501 --> 15:22.671
Yo. What's up, sire?
You sent for me?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.341
Chancellor, look. Look at me!

15:25.424 --> 15:27.927
3,000 years old
and check out my skin.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.346
It's like a baby's butt.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.598
Ageless, sire. Looking fresh.

15:32.681 --> 15:36.018
Ha! I owe it to my subjects
to look fabulous,

15:36.101 --> 15:37.061
don't you think?

15:37.144 --> 15:39.396
There are other obligations, sire.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.232
Like ruling and stuff.
Let's see…

15:42.316 --> 15:45.069
I need your signature
on these taxes, decrees,

15:45.152 --> 15:48.447
this here declaration of war
and my paycheck.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.115
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.409
-[both chuckle]
-Very good.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.662
[both laughing]

15:54.745 --> 15:56.413
Oh, Chancellor,

15:56.497 --> 15:59.249
when will you learn to focus
on what really matters?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.460
A monarch's regime
is only as powerful

16:01.543 --> 16:03.796
as his skin care regime.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.297
Word. Mm-hm.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.217
You know, some say I have a face
like a Greek god.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.761
Well, you are a Greek god, so…

16:10.844 --> 16:12.638
Whoa! Wait, is…

16:12.721 --> 16:14.682
-Is that a wrinkle?
-Where?

16:14.765 --> 16:16.809
It is! It's a wrinkle!

16:16.892 --> 16:18.102
I look like an old avocado

16:18.185 --> 16:21.021
that's been left
and forgotten in the fridge!

16:21.105 --> 16:22.147
Here it comes.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.483
I'm ugly!

16:28.904 --> 16:30.155
Oh, now, where is it?

16:30.239 --> 16:32.032
The crawly thing with
the round shell and the eyes.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.576
-Where is it?
-[playing fanfare]

16:35.202 --> 16:38.163
Here you go, sire. Your Royal Snail.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.748
Oh! Oh, oh, thank you.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.209
This mollusk has
the rejuvenating power

16:42.292 --> 16:44.712
-of a thousand facials.
-[meows]

16:48.590 --> 16:50.467
What?! Is it empty?

16:51.135 --> 16:52.386
[coughing]

16:52.469 --> 16:53.887
Take it away!

16:53.971 --> 16:56.223
Bring me another sea snail
at once!

16:58.559 --> 17:00.352
-[indistinct whispering]
-Uh-oh.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.229
-Chancellor!
-Okay, uh…

17:02.312 --> 17:05.524
Full disclosure, man, uh…
We're out of snails.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.942
What?!

17:07.026 --> 17:10.237
In fact, the entire
snail population has been, uh…

17:10.320 --> 17:12.990
What's the word?
Oh, yeah… depleted.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.367
You're telling me there are…

17:15.451 --> 17:17.411
-no more snails?
-There are no more snails.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.913
-And you're confident of that?
-Relatively confident.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.623
[shrieking]

17:21.707 --> 17:24.043
Oh, Chancellor,
for the love of Hermes,

17:24.126 --> 17:26.587
my kingdom for a snail!

17:26.670 --> 17:29.006
No, no, no. I'm being hasty.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.884
Half my kingdom for a snail!

17:31.967 --> 17:33.719
No, no, no, a boon. Yes.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.513
I'll grant a boon to whomever
shall bring me a snail.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.349
Gotcha.
I'll draw up the decree, sire.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.606
-[whip cracks]
-[whinnying]

17:45.689 --> 17:48.734
A Royal Decree
from King Poseidon?

17:48.817 --> 17:51.070
"To all citizens of the sea,

17:51.153 --> 17:53.572
the King requires a snail at once…

17:53.655 --> 17:57.076
blah blah blah
skin care blah blah--"

17:57.159 --> 17:58.494
Wait a minute.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.913
A snail?

18:00.996 --> 18:03.707
No, it's too perfect.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.085
Get rid of Gary,
get rid of SpongeBob.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.545
Oh, yeah.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.798
[cackling]

18:16.678 --> 18:19.348
Gary, I'm home!

18:22.559 --> 18:24.978
Gare-Bear?
Hey, where are you, buddy?

18:30.275 --> 18:31.485
Gary?

18:33.737 --> 18:34.822
Gary?

18:35.739 --> 18:37.366
You must be in the-- No.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.659
Gary?

18:38.742 --> 18:39.910
Gary?

18:39.993 --> 18:41.036
Gary?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.539
Gary? Gary, Gary, Gary! Gary!

18:43.622 --> 18:45.124
Gary! Where's Gary?

18:45.207 --> 18:49.545
Gary!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.004

18:59.930 --> 19:04.184
Gary, where are you?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.479

19:10.941 --> 19:14.278
[sniffles] Oh, Gary.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.071
[sobbing]

19:18.323 --> 19:21.618
I loved you since
the first day we met.

-Well, hi, Gary.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.122
Gary, do you want to be friends?

20:09.124 --> 20:10.500
Me, too.

SpongeBob! SpongeBob!

20:23.513 --> 20:26.767
Hey, SpongeBob!
I found this flyer.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.435
Gary's missing!

20:28.518 --> 20:29.770
[SpongeBob sniffling]

20:30.479 --> 20:31.772
I know, Patrick.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.608
SpongeBob?

20:34.691 --> 20:38.862
Oh, Patrick, if something were
to happen to Gary, I, well…

20:39.529 --> 20:40.906
I don't know what I'd do.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.116
I'm sorry, buddy.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.160
Hey! Maybe he left a clue.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.496
-[toy squeaks]
-Oh!

20:50.040 --> 20:53.168
[gasps] Look! A clue!

20:53.252 --> 20:57.005
[gasps] Gary's been snailnapped!

20:57.089 --> 21:00.842
And taken to The Lost City
of Atlantic City!

21:00.926 --> 21:03.011
[chewing] Oh, really?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.638
That's awesome!

21:05.514 --> 21:08.100
[spits] Now we know where he is.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.435
Mm.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.272
Not really that awesome, Patrick.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.815
Listen to this.

21:14.898 --> 21:18.235
"Made famous by the glitzy palace
Poseidon calls home.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.280
The Lost City of Atlantic City
is a scary,

21:21.363 --> 21:24.741
vice-ridden cesspool
of moral depravity."

21:24.825 --> 21:28.328
Wow. All that, and it's lost, too?

21:28.412 --> 21:32.374
"King Poseidon has proven
himself a whimsical tyrant,

known for executing his subjects
by beheading them

in a flamboyant floor show
extravaganza.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.591
Our advice for those
travelling here is…

21:42.592 --> 21:43.635
…don't."

21:43.719 --> 21:47.931
[gulps] This King Poseidon
sounds like a tough customer.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.808
Oh, yeah. Tough.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.894
Aw, so what?
This is about friends.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.815
And friends don't let friends
become somebody else's face cream!

21:56.898 --> 21:58.066
Not what friends do.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.403
-So what if it's dangerous and scary?
-So what!

22:01.486 --> 22:06.283
What is stopping me right now
from going there, rescuing Gary

22:06.366 --> 22:09.244
and standing up to this
King Poseidon, huh?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.538
-I don't know!
-Well, I do!

22:11.621 --> 22:13.540
-What is it?
-I…

Oh, Gary.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.594
Tartar sauce!

What's the next best thing
to courage?

-Resolve?
-No.

-Nah.

-A buddy! A wingman!

A wingman?

22:44.696 --> 22:46.406
A friend.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.825
Really, Patrick?
You'd go with me?

22:48.909 --> 22:51.870
Yeah… right behind you!

22:51.953 --> 22:54.289
Do I smell a road trip?

22:54.372 --> 22:56.625
[gasps] That could be my breath.

[both laughing]

22:59.544 --> 23:01.213
Okey-dokey.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.131
Now, let's drill down on a plan.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.841
Pat, you're in charge of transpo.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.885
Just remember, I don't drive
and you don't have a car.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.220
Oh…

23:11.223 --> 23:12.724
[motor rumbling]

23:16.853 --> 23:18.313
Beep, beep!

23:25.821 --> 23:27.906
Hey, boys!

23:27.989 --> 23:30.826
Don't know if you have any use
for this old thing,

23:30.909 --> 23:32.869
if you're going on any trips or journeys

23:32.953 --> 23:35.288
or quests or rescue missions.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.416
But if you are, Otto is your ticket.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.127
[both] Otto!

23:40.210 --> 23:44.214
Just tell ol' Otto where you want to go
and it will take you there!

23:44.297 --> 23:45.757
All aboard.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.092
-You're fired.
-Cool!

23:47.717 --> 23:49.511
A self-driving boat.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.638
Thanks, Plankton. You're the best!

23:51.721 --> 23:54.099
I know, I know. Bye-bye.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.435
-Otto. Find, Gary.
-You got it.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.105
[tires screeching]

24:03.024 --> 24:06.027
No, Patrick.
You got to be more specific.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.655
Otto, find Gary the snail.

[Otto] Recalculating.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.784
[Patrick and SpongeBob yelling]

24:12.868 --> 24:15.745
Ugh. Here, let me try.

24:15.829 --> 24:18.915
Take them to
The Lost City of Atlantic City

24:18.999 --> 24:20.375
and don't ever come back!

24:22.085 --> 24:24.296
Never hurts to employ a little hyperbole.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.214
It is my pleasure to serve you.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.803
[both yelling]

24:35.015 --> 24:37.601
[cackles] Bon voyage, boys.

24:37.684 --> 24:40.812
I'm ready. I'm ready. They're dead.

24:50.405 --> 24:54.034
This is gonna be like
one of those buddy movies.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.035
We're the buddies!

24:55.118 --> 24:58.038
[chuckles] Not sure that really applies,
Patrick, but--

24:58.121 --> 24:59.289
Why not?

24:59.372 --> 25:01.875

Excuse me. Sorry. My bad. Whoop.

48:11.096 --> 48:12.723
Sorry. Whoa!

48:13.765 --> 48:17.436
Hi, there! Excuse me, King Poseidon, sire.

48:17.519 --> 48:19.688
There's been a misunderstanding
about Gary.

48:19.771 --> 48:20.772
-Gary?
-[meows]

48:20.897 --> 48:22.190
-Gary.
-Gary?

48:22.274 --> 48:24.234
The snail that you're rubbing
all over your face right now.

48:24.318 --> 48:27.154
Nonsense. Besides,
this snail's name is Fred.

48:27.237 --> 48:29.323
"Fred?" You renamed Gary?

48:29.406 --> 48:30.657
-Fred.
-Gary.

48:30.824 --> 48:33.619
-Fred! Fred!
-Gary! Gary!

48:33.702 --> 48:35.120
-Fred!
-Gary!

48:35.203 --> 48:36.204
Fred!

48:38.123 --> 48:39.499
Seize them!

48:39.583 --> 48:40.667
[SpongeBob] Gary!

48:41.293 --> 48:42.377
Gary!

48:42.461 --> 48:45.255
But Gary loves me! And I love him.

48:47.466 --> 48:49.092
[meows sadly]

48:52.512 --> 48:53.889
[Sandy] Yeehaw!

48:57.351 --> 48:58.935
Incoming!

48:59.519 --> 49:01.313
[laughs]

49:02.939 --> 49:04.566
Whoa!

49:07.194 --> 49:08.487
Good rockets.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.989
-[knocking on door]
-SpongeBob?

49:11.073 --> 49:13.116
Get yer co-pilot goggles, dude,

49:13.200 --> 49:14.743
'cause we're goin' sleddin'!

49:15.285 --> 49:16.578
SpongeBob?

49:19.456 --> 49:20.749
You in here?

49:21.875 --> 49:23.001
SpongeBob?

49:24.711 --> 49:26.296
[yelps]

49:26.380 --> 49:27.714
SpongeBob!

49:27.881 --> 49:29.841
Huh. That's weird.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.469
Something's fishy around here.

49:44.606 --> 49:47.109
All right, what'd y'all do with SpongeBob?

49:47.192 --> 49:49.111
We don't know where he is, Sandy.

49:49.194 --> 49:50.987
Hasn't been here in days. [screams]

49:51.071 --> 49:53.824
Don't you play coy with me, cephalopod.

49:53.907 --> 49:55.826
-And you, arthropod!
-[shrieks]

49:55.909 --> 49:57.661
Start talking. Where is he?

49:57.744 --> 50:00.205
Tied up in the basement?
Stuffed in your trunk?

50:00.747 --> 50:02.791
Nay, I could never harm the lad.

50:02.874 --> 50:04.793
His absence has taught me that much.

50:04.876 --> 50:08.088
And I'm not just talking about
the money I'm losing with him gone.

50:08.672 --> 50:09.715
[both] Hmm…

50:11.007 --> 50:13.677
Okay, fifty percent
talking about the money

50:13.760 --> 50:16.179
and fifty percent talking about
I truly miss the boy.

50:16.263 --> 50:17.556
Aw.

50:17.723 --> 50:21.601
I hate to admit it, but things
just aren't the same without him.

50:21.685 --> 50:25.355
There's no denying it. We need SpongeBob.

50:25.439 --> 50:28.442
Did anyone ever stop to think
that he might need us?

50:28.525 --> 50:32.195
This is Perch Perkins coming to you
from The Lost City of Atlantic City.

50:32.279 --> 50:33.864
I'm standing on the strip outside

50:33.947 --> 50:36.616
Poseidon's Palace and Casino,
where two suspects have been

50:36.700 --> 50:38.452
-taken into custody tonight…
-[gasping]

50:38.535 --> 50:40.871
…following an attempt on the Royal Snail.

50:40.954 --> 50:43.874
The sponge and sea star were
impersonating a lounge act

50:43.957 --> 50:47.043
when they made an attempt
on Poseidon's prize mollusk.

50:47.127 --> 50:48.336
[meows]

50:48.420 --> 50:50.005
[all] It's Gary!

50:50.088 --> 50:53.091
The suspects' vehicle was apprehended
after a high-speed chase.

50:53.175 --> 50:56.261
Mr. Krabs. What happened to Otto?

50:56.344 --> 50:59.681
Well, he took an automated vacation!

50:59.765 --> 51:01.475
In a related story, Poseidon's Palace

51:01.558 --> 51:04.186
presents a command performance,
featuring the execution

51:04.269 --> 51:07.689
of the suspects in the Aqua Room
this Friday night.

51:07.773 --> 51:10.400
[spits] Execution of the suspects?

51:10.484 --> 51:12.486
What happened to habeas swordfish?

51:12.569 --> 51:15.947
It's a fun-filled family event,
with opening act Kelpy G.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.991
One performance only,
tickets still available.

51:18.074 --> 51:19.409
[both gasp]

51:19.493 --> 51:22.037
-We've got to go help them!
-We embark immediately.

51:22.662 --> 51:24.164
Excuse me.

51:24.247 --> 51:26.041
Can I tag along?

51:26.124 --> 51:27.167
Plankton?

51:27.250 --> 51:29.377
What have you got to do with this?

51:29.461 --> 51:31.087
[stammering] I… I…

51:31.171 --> 51:34.549
I might have had a teensy-weensy
hand in a very--

51:34.716 --> 51:36.760
Yeah, yeah,
we'll hear about it in the car.

51:36.843 --> 51:38.595
Mr. Squidward, are ya coming?

51:38.678 --> 51:40.806
Ha! Fat chance.

51:41.556 --> 51:45.227
Fat chance I'd miss
a Kelpy G performance. I'm in.

51:45.310 --> 51:47.479
To the Pattymobile!

51:57.197 --> 51:59.115
What, this old tub?

51:59.199 --> 52:01.743
Never judge a Pattymobile
by its bun, Squidward.

52:16.716 --> 52:18.635
Let's light this puppy!

52:18.802 --> 52:20.679
[crank squeaking]

52:23.473 --> 52:26.101
[Mr. Krabs cackling]

52:26.685 --> 52:28.937
[Sandy] Yeehaw!

52:29.020 --> 52:30.689
[all exclaiming]

52:30.897 --> 52:34.067
Mommy!

52:42.450 --> 52:45.620
[long, somber musical note playing]

53:00.135 --> 53:01.928
[chuckles]

53:05.599 --> 53:07.726
[playing higher note]

53:09.978 --> 53:12.063
Huh? SpongeBob?

53:12.147 --> 53:13.315
Are you okay?

53:14.691 --> 53:17.402
Hey, buddy. Sorry about this.

53:17.485 --> 53:20.030
[sniffling] It's not your fault, Patrick.

53:20.113 --> 53:22.824
You've been a true friend this whole time.

53:22.908 --> 53:26.202
Never wavered, never faltered. It's just…

53:26.286 --> 53:28.413
I failed, that's all!

53:28.496 --> 53:32.000
And I'll never see
innocent little Gary again.

53:32.083 --> 53:34.711
Oh, my heart is broken!

53:34.794 --> 53:37.380
-[crying]
-Oh, come on now.

53:37.464 --> 53:40.467
Buck up. It's not over yet, SpongeBob.

53:40.634 --> 53:44.012
It sure feels over. And crappy.

53:44.095 --> 53:46.848
Just saying there's
two sides to every coin.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.808
Oh, Patrick, what does a coin have to--

53:48.892 --> 53:50.685
Wait, did you just say "coin"?

53:50.769 --> 53:52.812
Me? Uh, don't think so.

53:52.896 --> 53:54.439
-[mooing noise]
-[giggles]

53:54.522 --> 53:56.650
You did. You said "coin"!

53:57.233 --> 53:59.819
-Not remembering that exactly.
-[makes telephone noise]

53:59.903 --> 54:02.989
-Hello?
-The challenge coin! Of course!

54:03.073 --> 54:05.951
Oh, don't you see, Patrick? We're saved!

54:06.034 --> 54:07.577
I said hello.

54:09.329 --> 54:10.997
Patrick, it's gone!

54:11.081 --> 54:14.417
Meh. Was the challenge coin
really that useful?

54:14.501 --> 54:15.835
Hello?

54:17.045 --> 54:19.506
Oh! Stupid prank callers.

54:19.589 --> 54:21.132
Hey, wait a sec.

54:21.216 --> 54:24.094
I gave it to you, remember?
For safe keeping.

54:24.177 --> 54:25.303
No.

54:25.387 --> 54:28.556
Come on, it was last night!
We were at the crappie tables.

54:29.140 --> 54:31.810
[croupier] Winner! Place your bets.

54:31.893 --> 54:35.730
Come on, seven! Come on, seven!
Come on, seven!

54:37.899 --> 54:39.526
You!

54:39.609 --> 54:41.987
You gambled away my challenge coin!

54:42.070 --> 54:45.240
You wrecked our entire mission
with one stupid bet!

54:45.323 --> 54:47.325
Well, only after you kept saying…

54:48.243 --> 54:51.079
Let it ride, Patrick! Let it ride!

54:51.162 --> 54:52.789
-Whoo!
-But, SpongeBob…

54:52.872 --> 54:54.916
What if you need
the challenge coin tomorrow

54:55.000 --> 54:57.210
to help you summon your courage?

54:57.293 --> 54:59.212
Tomorrow is for weenies!

55:00.213 --> 55:03.091
Whoo! [laughing]

55:03.174 --> 55:06.761
Well, it's tomorrow and guess
who's the weenie.

55:07.345 --> 55:08.805
[huffs]

55:08.888 --> 55:11.057
I… can't…

55:11.224 --> 55:13.059
believe you!

55:13.143 --> 55:16.813
You can't believe me?
Are you serious right now?

55:16.896 --> 55:19.315
Well! Maybe you can believe this.

55:19.399 --> 55:20.817
I'm out of here!

55:27.490 --> 55:29.784
And don't come back!

55:29.868 --> 55:32.454
Oh, don't worry, I won't!

55:32.537 --> 55:34.289
-Good!
-Ever!

55:34.372 --> 55:36.124
-Fine!
-Super!

55:37.834 --> 55:38.918
Hey, losers.

55:40.378 --> 55:41.629
Oh, hey, Sage.

55:41.713 --> 55:42.964
Sage, glad you're here.

55:43.048 --> 55:45.508
Guess who gambled away my challenge coin.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.844
Guess who blames everyone else
for his troubles.

55:47.927 --> 55:48.803
Enough!

55:49.804 --> 55:51.806
Did I mention you are
the worst epic heroes

55:51.890 --> 55:54.184
for whom I have ever been a spirit guide?

55:54.267 --> 55:56.311
Um, I think we went over that
this morning.

55:56.394 --> 55:57.812
I believe we did, yeah.

55:57.896 --> 55:59.397
[sighs]

56:00.190 --> 56:03.693
SpongeBob, the coin was just a symbol.

56:03.777 --> 56:05.820
The courage you seek is inside you,

56:05.904 --> 56:07.113
not in the coin.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.574
And it will come to you
in your hour of need.

56:09.657 --> 56:12.243
But isn't this my hour of need?

56:12.327 --> 56:14.871
[laughs] Oh, no.

56:14.954 --> 56:17.207
It gets way worse.

56:17.290 --> 56:18.708
Bye!

56:19.292 --> 56:22.128
-Worse?
-Dude said way worse.

56:23.046 --> 56:26.841
[scatting] Prepare the prisoners.

56:26.925 --> 56:28.259
Oh, that couldn't be for us.

56:28.343 --> 56:31.304
It's your big moment to fry…
I mean, shine.

56:31.387 --> 56:34.557
[gasps] It is for us, Patrick!
We're gonna die!

56:35.642 --> 56:38.478
[Plankton] And that's how I got SpongeBob

56:38.561 --> 56:40.814
out of Bikini Bottom. [giggles]

56:40.897 --> 56:43.525
-Why, that's monstrous!
-Wait, that sounds good.

56:43.608 --> 56:46.361
-Oh, brother.
-What do you expect? I'm evil.

56:46.444 --> 56:48.154
Let's just focus on the plan.

56:48.238 --> 56:51.991
[Mr. Krabs] We're approaching
The Lost City of Atlantic City.

56:52.534 --> 56:54.869
-Make way there, make way!
-[pedestrians exclaim]

56:57.789 --> 56:58.998
Oh!

56:59.833 --> 57:00.959
Eww.

57:01.626 --> 57:05.380
"Sponge and Star Execution Extravaganza"?

57:05.463 --> 57:07.298
No time to lose!

57:10.009 --> 57:12.637
Woop, woop, woop! Ladies and gentlefish,

57:12.720 --> 57:15.098
welcome to the Aqua Room, y'all.

57:15.181 --> 57:17.892
The greatest show underwater.

57:17.976 --> 57:19.352
[playing upbeat tune]

57:19.435 --> 57:20.728
[Tiffany] My groupies and groupers…

57:20.812 --> 57:24.190
-We love you, Tiffany!
-Yeah holler at your girl!

57:24.274 --> 57:25.900
Are you ready to be entertained?

57:25.984 --> 57:27.569
Hmm? I can't hear you.

57:27.652 --> 57:30.113
Are you ready to be entertained?

57:30.196 --> 57:31.489
[laughs]

57:32.365 --> 57:35.243
All right, then,
let's meet the contestants.

57:35.326 --> 57:38.621
In this corner, a sponge and a star…

57:38.705 --> 57:41.458
…two of the ocean's
most notorious criminals!

57:41.541 --> 57:44.252
[crowd hissing, booing]

57:44.335 --> 57:47.797
And in this corner,
representing His Majesty the King,

57:47.881 --> 57:52.051
Poseidon's very own Chancellor!

57:52.135 --> 57:53.553
[crowd cheering]

57:53.636 --> 57:55.388
Now drum roll, maestro.

57:55.472 --> 57:57.307
-[drum roll]
-Put your fins together

57:57.390 --> 57:59.225
for the duke of the dirty deed,

57:59.309 --> 58:01.352
the earl of execution,

58:01.436 --> 58:03.563
that axe-wielding maniac…

58:03.646 --> 58:07.817
…oh, yeah, Lemont! [laughing]

58:07.901 --> 58:10.445
[crowd chanting] Lamont! Lamont! Lamont!

58:11.905 --> 58:13.656
Oh, I love me some Lemont.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.742
Mm, mm, mm. He's so strong.

58:16.618 --> 58:17.744
[both gulping]

58:22.540 --> 58:23.833
Ladies and gentlemen,

58:23.917 --> 58:26.044
with a moment of smooth jazz

58:26.127 --> 58:28.421
in memory of the soon-to-be-goners,

58:28.505 --> 58:31.049
I give you Kelpy G.

58:31.132 --> 58:32.926
[playing "My Heart Will Go On"]

58:41.893 --> 58:43.520
Oh, Patrick, I feel terrible.

58:43.603 --> 58:45.396
I dragged you into this whole mess.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.232
It's okay, SpongeBob.

58:47.315 --> 58:50.443
I made a plea deal with the prosecution!

58:52.403 --> 58:54.322
Oh, that's good-- Wait, you did what?

58:54.405 --> 58:56.616
All I have to do is, uh… oh, yeah!

58:56.699 --> 58:59.994
"Bring incriminating evidence
against the defendant."

59:00.078 --> 59:02.747
-[laughs]
-Patrick, I'm the defendant.

59:02.830 --> 59:05.124
You are? Oh.

59:15.343 --> 59:17.971
Let the proceedings begin!

Your Honor, I would like
to enter into evidence

[Gary meows]

59:27.355 --> 59:30.191
-Gary!
-How dare you!

59:30.275 --> 59:32.610
That's about all I can say.

59:32.694 --> 59:35.154
How dare you come here

59:35.238 --> 59:38.825
to the sanctuary of our revered sovereign,

59:38.908 --> 59:42.954
to rob him of his very lifeblood,

59:43.037 --> 59:44.622
his adorable good looks.

59:44.706 --> 59:46.916
[laughs] Go on.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.253
How indeed dare you.

59:51.504 --> 59:53.381
-[crowd jeering]
-Guilty!

If it please the court,

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:13.568

in SpongeBob's defense.

It does not please the court.

to summer camp.

1:00:40.470 --> 1:00:42.889
In fact, that's where we all met.

I'm Sandy Cheeks from Texas.

1:01:42.490 --> 1:01:44.242
Hi, Sandy. I'm SpongeBob.

1:01:44.325 --> 1:01:45.785
Pleased to meet ya.

1:01:45.868 --> 1:01:48.287
Does everybody wear spacesuits in Texas?

1:01:48.371 --> 1:01:51.207
They do if they want to visit
you underwater critters.

1:01:51.290 --> 1:01:53.000
We all breathe air on the surface.

1:01:53.584 --> 1:01:55.878
It's just our way of synthesizing oxygen.

1:01:55.962 --> 1:01:57.630
Same as you do with water.

1:01:58.339 --> 1:02:01.342
Whoa. Are you a scientist?

1:02:01.426 --> 1:02:03.886
Naw, I'm just a squirrel.

1:02:47.513 --> 1:02:51.100

1:02:51.184 --> 1:02:53.436
I should follow my dream.

1:02:53.519 --> 1:02:55.855
That's a friend, people.

1:02:55.938 --> 1:02:57.857
And that's why, in my eyes…

1:02:58.691 --> 1:03:01.194
SpongeBob is no criminal.

1:03:01.277 --> 1:03:03.529
He's the best little fella

1:03:03.613 --> 1:03:05.990
to ever walk the sea bottom. And that's…

1:03:06.073 --> 1:03:09.368
That's just how I feel about it. So…

1:03:09.452 --> 1:03:11.704
Please, don't hurt him.

that somebody stole your snail."

The law of: "There's probably
nothing I can do about it."

1:03:33.017 --> 1:03:36.229
Well, in this sea star's opinion,

1:03:36.312 --> 1:03:41.442
those laws should be broken
and SpongeBob is proof of it!

1:03:41.943 --> 1:03:43.861
All he's guilty of

1:03:43.945 --> 1:03:48.699
is having the fortitude
to try and rescue a friend.

1:03:49.534 --> 1:03:51.035
[meows]

1:03:51.118 --> 1:03:52.203
How do I know?

1:03:52.286 --> 1:03:55.456
Oh, I was just a lonely bump on a log

when I first met him.

Hello my name is SpongeBob,
what's your name?

1:04:15.309 --> 1:04:18.312
I'm Pa-Pa-Patrick.

1:04:20.439 --> 1:04:22.817
Why are you crying, Pa-Pa-Patrick?

1:04:22.900 --> 1:04:25.111
I'm homesick.

1:04:26.571 --> 1:04:29.031
Well, that's a pretty good reason.

1:04:29.699 --> 1:04:33.119
-Maybe all you need is a friend.
-[wailing]

1:04:33.202 --> 1:04:35.955
I don't have any friends!

1:04:36.038 --> 1:04:38.499
-Well, you've got one now.
-Really?

1:04:39.542 --> 1:04:41.669
-Who is it?
-It's me!

1:04:41.752 --> 1:04:45.089
-Do you mean it?
-Of course. Come on!

1:04:46.799 --> 1:04:50.136
[Patrick] That sweet little sponge

1:04:50.219 --> 1:04:53.598
rescued this miserable little sea star.

1:04:53.681 --> 1:04:57.226
And things haven't changed
that much today, Your Honor.

in summer camp.

I remember it like it was yesterday.

But, I won't.

I might even speak
about how he inspired me

with a broken-down luncheonette.

how he encouraged me

to start up me own restaurant.

Nay, you'll hear none such praise from me.

Because it wouldn't do him full justice.
