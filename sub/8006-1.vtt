02:06.877 --> 02:09.127
Just tell him, damn it! 

02:09.338 --> 02:11.297
- Tell him to give him coffee.
- You tell him! 

02:11.507 --> 02:12.507
Give me that! 

02:13.300 --> 02:15.885
Look, get him some coffee or cookies. 

02:53.257 --> 02:54.257
I know that! 

02:54.424 --> 02:55.591
Give me the phone. 

04:42.532 --> 04:43.532
Hey! 

04:43.825 --> 04:46.202
Where do you think you're going?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.079
Going home.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.290
Hey. Hey! 

05:33.959 --> 05:35.334
Officer.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.880
The guy walked into the bushes,
maybe to pee, but he never came back.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.590
Do you need help?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.426
Do you own this car?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.345
That's not him.
The guy walked into the bushes.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.222
He said he was going home.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.724
Going home?

05:50.434 --> 05:52.560
Gentlemen, return to your cars.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.020
What about the car?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.272
I'll radio for a tow truck.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.859
Let's shove it out of the way. 
We'll get this lane moving!

06:00.569 --> 06:01.861
It's dangerous.

06:02.112 --> 06:06.282
We got a lot of glass and steel
rushing by us at high speeds.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.534
Wait a minute.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.205
Prendergast. Downtown Robbery.
Let's go.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.124
I'm in linoleum tile, myself.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.294
All right.
You, back in your vehicle.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.546
You push. I'll steer.

06:23.467 --> 06:27.011
We do ceramics too.
Special discount for law officers.

06:27.262 --> 06:31.932
I love <i>Cops,</i> the TV show.
Don't you watch it? I never miss it.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.642
You're lucky you caught me.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.894
I am?

06:35.145 --> 06:37.563
Today's my last day as a cop.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.982
Lucky me.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.278
Don't touch it!

06:44.529 --> 06:47.156
Don't touch it!
Just get this lane moving.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.325
Okay. Sorry.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.661
Officer?

06:54.664 --> 06:55.664
Officer?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.261
Oh, my God! The phone!

07:10.555 --> 07:12.014
Come on, baby.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.977
Watch your fingers.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.355
Take Tucker, okay?

07:25.320 --> 07:26.320
Hello? 

07:27.697 --> 07:29.156
<i>Mom?</i>

07:29.366 --> 07:30.366
<i>Hello?</i> 

07:30.617 --> 07:33.494
Mom, can you help me open this?

07:35.956 --> 07:36.956
Hello?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.833
Can I get some change 
for the phone, please?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.752
No change. 
Have to buy something.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.178
- Eighty-fie sen.
- What?

09:14.387 --> 09:15.721
Eighty-fie sen.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.141
- I don't understand.
- Eighty-fie sen!

09:20.477 --> 09:22.478
Eighty-five cents?

09:23.313 --> 09:26.315
It doesn't give me enough money
for the phone call.

09:29.945 --> 09:33.322
I'll give you 50 cents.
You give me 50 cents change.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.325
- No way.
- Yes, way.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.453
Drink, eighty-fie sen.
You pay or go!

09:39.829 --> 09:43.624
I don't understand "fie."
There's a "V" in the word "five."

09:43.833 --> 09:45.000
No "V's" in China?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.920
- Not Chinese. I'm Korean.
- Whatever.

09:48.171 --> 09:52.800
You come to my country, take my money
and don't even learn my language?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.596
You're Korean?

09:58.098 --> 10:02.518
Do you have any idea how much money
my country has given your country?

10:02.852 --> 10:03.852
How much?

10:06.022 --> 10:09.024
I don't know. It's a lot.
You can bet on that.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.694
You go now! No trouble!

10:14.531 --> 10:16.156
I stay.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.200
What do you think of that?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.537
Where are you going?
You got a bat?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.872
What are you doing?
That bat--

10:30.130 --> 10:31.922
Let go. Let go!

10:36.219 --> 10:38.512
Jesus Christ! What is this?

10:39.389 --> 10:41.348
The last stand on Fiji?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.394
- Take the money! Take the money!
- What?

10:45.645 --> 10:46.895
Take the money.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.274
Take your hands away from your--
I can't under-- Stop it!

10:51.735 --> 10:55.154
All right.
Speak slowly and distinctly.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.697
Take the money.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.913
You think I'm a thief?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.585
You see, I'm not the thief.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.796
I'm not the one charging 85 cents
for a stinking soda!

11:13.048 --> 11:14.548
You're the thief!

11:17.927 --> 11:21.847
I'm just standing up
for my rights as a consumer.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.561
I'm rolling back prices to 1965.
What do you think of that?

11:31.524 --> 11:34.276
Doughnuts. Package of six.
How much?

11:34.819 --> 11:35.819
$1.12.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.115
Too much.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.204
Aspirin. Price?

11:45.622 --> 11:46.622
$3.40.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.457
Oh, please!

11:54.631 --> 11:57.299
AA batteries. Package of four.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.053
$4.29.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.390
Nice try.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.934
This whole shelf looks suspect.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.949
One soda...

12:22.158 --> 12:23.492
12 ounces.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.578
Fifty sen!

12:29.791 --> 12:31.291
Sold.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.854
It's been a pleasure
frequenting your establishment.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.324
Very funny.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.535
Very, very funny.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.289
Genuine Arizona sand, Prendergast. 
Get used to it.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.540
I bet.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.042
Genuine Santa Monica sand's
more like it.

13:14.335 --> 13:18.547
It's from my cat's litterbox,
but he said you could keep the lumps.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.469
You took my stuff out first?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.387
Heck, no. 
How fun would that be?

13:25.555 --> 13:29.475
- How do I get a pen out?
- Don't need no pen. Use the cat turd.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.439
It's your last day. Be careful.
Remember Forsythe?

13:36.232 --> 13:39.401
- Forsythe got 5 minutes to retirement.
- Two!

13:39.652 --> 13:43.363
Two minutes, nothing! 
The guy was on the way to his fucking car.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.867
Mowed down by a runaway impound.
Nasty.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.869
- Ironic.
- Ironic as fuck!

13:49.078 --> 13:51.038
Anything can happen today.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.832
You know how dangerous a desk can be.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.585
Watch out for paper cuts.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.545
Funny, funny, funny.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.548
Sorry.
I tried to dissuade them.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.344
Hey, Sandra.
It's obligatory, I guess.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.681
Now, what else do they have 
up their sleeve?

14:10.433 --> 14:12.684
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

14:14.354 --> 14:17.606
Are we still on for lunch?
You're not going home early?

14:17.941 --> 14:19.233
Why would I go home early?

14:19.776 --> 14:21.276
Last day and all.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.903
I'm not superstitious.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.364
- Sandy, you ready?
- In a minute.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.033
Leave the poor desk jockey alone.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.118
See if you know how to start the car.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.705
Let's not get our pantyhose in a bind.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.208
I'll miss you, Prendergast.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.294
You really will? Me too.

14:40.630 --> 14:41.880
Come on, let's go!

14:42.298 --> 14:44.341
- Lunch?
- Yup. 

15:06.406 --> 15:08.782
- Mommy! 
- Just a second, baby.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.952
When will we make the strawberry cake?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.621
Soon. I thought sundown would be good.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.915
- Here. Not in the house.
- Okay, mom.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.836
Just a few kids. 
I didn't want to do a whole big thing.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.797
No.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.541
Prendergast here.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.543
- Hi.
<i>- Hello?</i>

16:01.794 --> 16:03.795
- It's me.
<i>- Hi.</i> 

16:05.048 --> 16:08.175
I wish you were home.
Wouldn't you come home now?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.052
What's wrong?

16:10.720 --> 16:11.845
<i>I don't know.</i>

16:12.722 --> 16:15.223
I got a little scared....

16:17.310 --> 16:19.227
I'd really like you to come home.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.230
What is it, honey?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.903
I don't know.
I was wrapping some...

16:28.154 --> 16:31.073
some glasses up and some things...

16:32.033 --> 16:35.077
and I got really scared.

16:38.039 --> 16:41.917
You're not doing this move
just for me, are you?

16:42.251 --> 16:44.920
You really want to do it, don't you?

16:45.755 --> 16:48.924
The important thing is we're together.
That's what counts.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.551
Yeah, but you're not here.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.012
Well, I will be soon, baby.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.768
Say it.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.356
<i>- Say it!</i>
- I'll be home soon.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.525
No, say it!

17:07.151 --> 17:10.945
I'll be home soon, and I love you.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.157
I love you too.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.954
- Feel better?
- No, I don't feel better!

17:23.084 --> 17:25.419
<i>London Bridge is falling down</i>

17:26.045 --> 17:27.963
<i>Falling down, falling down</i>

17:28.214 --> 17:30.382
<i>London bridge is falling down</i>
Help me.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.927
<i>My fair lady</i>

17:35.430 --> 17:36.888
You my fair lady?

17:40.810 --> 17:42.227
Yes.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.066
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.367
What you doing, mister?

18:40.036 --> 18:41.453
Nothing.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.372
You're trespassing on private property.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.208
- Trespassing?
- Loitering too.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.627
That's right.
You're loitering too.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.171
I didn't see any signs.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.548
What you call that?

18:54.884 --> 18:58.053
- Graffiti?
- No, man.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.057
That's not fucking graffiti!
That's a sign.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.392
He can't read it, man.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.355
I'll read it for you.
It says this is private property.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.191
No fucking trespassing.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.568
This means fucking you!

19:15.196 --> 19:17.739
-It says all that?
- Yeah!

19:18.366 --> 19:21.368
If you wrote it in English,
I'd fucking understand it!

19:21.869 --> 19:24.287
- Thinks he's being funny.
- I'm not laughing.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.207
- I'm not either.
- Hold it, fellas.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.252
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

19:33.089 --> 19:36.049
This is a gangland thing, isn't it?

19:36.259 --> 19:39.845
We're having a territorial dispute?

19:40.930 --> 19:45.267
I've wandered into your pissing ground
or whatever the damn thing is...

19:45.434 --> 19:48.687
and you're offended by my presence.
I understand that.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.524
I mean, I wouldn't want you people
in my back yard, either.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.442
This is your home...

19:54.694 --> 19:57.362
and your home is your home.
I respect that.

19:57.572 --> 20:01.867
So if you would just back up
a step or two...

20:02.201 --> 20:04.619
I'll take my problems elsewhere.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.289
Fair enough?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.541
- What do you think?
- He should pay a toll.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.543
Good idea.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.837
You should pay a toll.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.214
Listen, fellas...

20:16.465 --> 20:19.551
I've had a rare morning.
I'm not in the mood to--

20:19.802 --> 20:20.969
What should he pay?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.804
How about that briefcase?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.390
Good idea.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.143
Give us your briefcase, man.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.481
I'm not giving you my goddamn briefcase.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.860
Motherfucker, give us
your motherfucking briefcase!

20:41.073 --> 20:42.240
Okay.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.868
Okay.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.246
I was willing to mind my own business.

20:48.497 --> 20:53.126
I was willing to respect your territory
and treat you like a man.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.920
You couldn't let a man...

20:55.171 --> 21:00.133
sit here for five minutes to rest
on your precious piece-of-shit hill?

21:02.803 --> 21:06.014
Want my briefcase?
I'll get it for you, all right?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.850
You want my briefcase?
Here's my briefcase!

21:16.692 --> 21:18.151
Where are you going?

21:18.361 --> 21:20.362
You forgot the briefcase!

21:27.912 --> 21:30.914
I'm going home!
Clear the path, you motherfucker!

21:32.625 --> 21:33.708
Clear the path!

21:34.126 --> 21:36.002
I'm going home!

21:56.399 --> 21:58.316
How'd they do that?

22:01.988 --> 22:03.071
- Gun!
- What?

22:03.572 --> 22:06.866
You're leaving today, right?
I gotta get your gun.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.077
Right.

22:09.578 --> 22:14.708
I need your John Doe right here, 
here and here.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.552
Got time to take a statement?

22:25.761 --> 22:28.096
I know you wanna go
before you get killed....

22:28.347 --> 22:30.724
Yeah, Brian, I'm still working here.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.600
This guy's a little excited.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.228
Mr. Lee, come on in.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.358
What'd he say?

22:40.693 --> 22:43.528
You know, I don't know.
Mr. Lee is Korean.

22:43.738 --> 22:47.115
I'm Japanese, in case
you never bothered to notice.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.118
- Mr. Lee, speak English, okay?
- Sure.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.911
Sit down.

22:52.538 --> 22:57.000
He'll help you. Mr. Lee owns a market.
He was hit less than an hour ago.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.627
Sorry, Mr. Lee, no smoking.

23:00.963 --> 23:04.299
Mr. Lee, let's just start off
with what he looked like.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.054
White man, white shirt, tie.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.931
- What color was his tie?
- Color?

23:14.268 --> 23:17.312
I don't know color.
The guy attack me, okay?

23:17.521 --> 23:20.023
He bust up my store.
I'm lucky to be alive.

23:20.441 --> 23:23.651
Just try and relax.
What did he steal from you?

23:23.903 --> 23:26.154
Did not steal!
Attack me, okay?

23:26.405 --> 23:29.282
Say he fix my prices.
Bust up my merchandise.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.492
He didn't rob you?

23:30.743 --> 23:33.787
The guy crazy! 
I told him, "Take my money."

23:34.038 --> 23:38.583
He say no. He call me "thief,"
then he break up my merchandise.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.668
Then he buy a soda and take off.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.463
He bought a soda. 
He paid for it?

23:43.672 --> 23:45.924
I told you, the guy crazy.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.259
Sorry, I thought this was a robbery.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.638
Mr. Lee, we have to go talk 
to somebody else.

23:51.972 --> 23:55.058
- You were assaulted, this man works robberies. 
- Robberies?

23:55.351 --> 23:57.185
That's right. Come on.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.981
- Baseball bat!
- What's that?

24:02.191 --> 24:04.984
- The guy take my baseball bat.
- You sell bats?

24:05.277 --> 24:08.822
No, keep for defense.
Under counter. Defense.

24:09.073 --> 24:12.534
You mean he stole your baseball bat
but paid for the soda?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.160
This guy's discriminating.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.871
That still doesn't count.
Let's go. Thanks.

24:20.376 --> 24:23.169
Go to the hospital.
Your arm might be broken!

24:23.379 --> 24:26.047
We'll look for this guy,
so shut the fuck up!

24:26.215 --> 24:29.801
What did this guy do?
Threaten you with his credit card?

24:30.010 --> 24:31.636
I told you he had a bat!

24:31.846 --> 24:35.181
If this guy's still around,
we'll find him and fuck him up.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.891
Then you go to the hospital?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.393
Shut up!

24:47.236 --> 24:48.403
Hello?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.407
Hello?

24:54.368 --> 24:58.079
Cut the crap. I know it's you.
What do you want?

25:01.083 --> 25:03.084
<i>It is you, isn't it?</i>

25:04.211 --> 25:05.211
Yeah.

25:05.379 --> 25:06.671
Yeah, it's me.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.720
You gotta stop calling me.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.764
It's Adele's birthday.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.268
Yes, I know.
What do you want?

25:23.772 --> 25:25.106
I'm coming home.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.358
What are you talking about?

25:29.111 --> 25:30.778
I just....

25:31.906 --> 25:35.408
I want you to know that
I'm coming home for her birthday.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.911
You're not coming here.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.873
Listen, Beth...

25:44.793 --> 25:46.628
I gotta see you.

25:49.465 --> 25:52.800
No, you listen to me.
This is my house now. I pay the rent.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.928
You don't pay child support.

25:55.179 --> 25:59.390
<i>- You just can't walk in and out.</i>
- Don't talk like that, Beth.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.561
I have to come home.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.980
I have to bring her a present.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.485
You know you can't come here!

26:17.451 --> 26:18.451
Hey!

26:22.831 --> 26:24.832
It's him! It's him, man!

26:27.670 --> 26:28.670
How's Adele?

26:30.673 --> 26:32.257
This isn't your home anymore.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.096
How is she?

26:40.140 --> 26:42.308
She's doing just fine without you.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.604
- Angie, get out.
- Come on, man.

26:46.855 --> 26:50.316
It's fucking broad daylight!
This shit ain't worth it!

26:50.526 --> 26:52.777
- Get the fuck out!
- Get out of the car!

26:53.028 --> 26:54.862
Give me one. Give me one.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.866
- And you?
- Don't.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.870
I'll call the police.

27:03.539 --> 27:04.539
Go, go, go!

27:05.874 --> 27:07.834
- I'm coming home.
- No.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.046
- I'm coming home.
- No.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.687
Did you get him?

28:28.332 --> 28:29.332
You missed.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.432
I missed too.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.780
No, don't fucking do it!

29:03.158 --> 29:05.493
No, man.
Fuck you, mother--!

29:09.748 --> 29:10.998
There, you see?

29:13.085 --> 29:15.002
That's the concept.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.847
Take some shooting lessons, asshole!

29:48.412 --> 29:49.829
She's open.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.295
Prendergast.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.422
Have a seat.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.340
Captain.

30:07.431 --> 30:08.806
Did you hear?

30:09.224 --> 30:10.892
The drive-by shooting?

30:11.351 --> 30:12.894
Disgusting!

30:13.687 --> 30:16.063
You know who'll have to take
the heat again...

30:16.315 --> 30:18.816
when the shit hits the fan.

30:24.907 --> 30:27.158
You're retiring a little early.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.077
You won't be getting your full pension.

30:30.579 --> 30:33.581
Yes, sir, that's right.
I won't.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.878
This isn't because you were wounded, is it?

30:41.757 --> 30:43.216
Wounded?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.092
Because, I mean...

30:45.969 --> 30:47.887
you're behind a desk now.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.264
Not much chance of getting wounded there.

30:50.933 --> 30:54.060
Look, captain, 
it has nothing to do with that.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.525
I'll make my speech.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.569
They make me do this, you understand.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.989
I hate to lose a good cop.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.535
Not too late to change your mind.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.288
Lot of good cops want to drop
the whole kit and caboodle.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.040
And who wouldn't?

31:16.250 --> 31:17.500
The pay stinks...

31:17.709 --> 31:21.504
and you're up to your ears
in human scum 16 hours a day.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.633
But it gets in your blood.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.470
A lot of good cops
get to the point of...

31:29.638 --> 31:31.931
slapping their badge down
on this desk...

31:32.891 --> 31:36.143
and find they just can't do it.
How about you?

31:36.603 --> 31:38.604
Will you stick with the team?

31:41.400 --> 31:44.318
No, captain.
I don't think I will.

31:49.825 --> 31:52.535
Like I say, they make me ask.
You understand.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.121
How are the kids?

31:56.331 --> 31:58.082
I don't have any.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.002
What the hell?

32:02.838 --> 32:05.131
I'd like to take my stick
to these clerks.

32:05.799 --> 32:09.927
- The file says--
- We lost a child.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.431
- Lost it?
- Her. Lost her.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.267
Yes, of course. Her.
That's rough.

32:17.019 --> 32:20.313
Well, it can be.
Yes, sir.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.777
Still married, right?

32:27.988 --> 32:29.697
Yes, sir, I am.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.873
That's good.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.568
Where you going?

33:49.778 --> 33:51.445
- I'm going home.
- Not this way.

33:51.780 --> 33:55.074
- Why not?
- Metrorail construction, that's why not.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.284
Go around.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.412
Just follow your tootsies.

34:00.372 --> 34:04.458
You sure you don't want something?
Coffee, soda, something?

34:04.751 --> 34:06.669
No, thank you, ma'am.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.797
I feel kind of stupid about this.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.924
Better safe than sorry.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.759
That's what I thought.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.679
You have a restraining order
against your husband?

34:16.972 --> 34:18.222
Ex-husband.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.975
He'd show up on the wrong day...

34:21.268 --> 34:24.978
or in the middle of the night,
pounding on the door.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.982
Thing is, he has this horrendous temper.

34:28.275 --> 34:31.235
I didn't know if a restraining order 
was a good idea...

34:31.445 --> 34:33.571
and if it'd do more harm than good.

34:33.947 --> 34:37.491
But the judge said 
we should make an example of him.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.954
So he can't come within 100 feet of us.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.498
Or is it yards?
Which is it? Feet or yards?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.208
That's up to the judge.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.337
- I thought it was a set thing.
- It's at his discretion.

34:50.505 --> 34:51.922
That's interesting.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.132
Does he drink?

34:55.510 --> 34:57.970
Oh, I thought you meant the judge!

34:58.805 --> 35:01.015
- No, I wouldn't say so.
- Do drugs?

35:01.600 --> 35:02.683
Oh, no.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.811
But he has a propensity for violence?

35:06.313 --> 35:08.856
Yeah, I think you could say that.

35:10.150 --> 35:12.359
Did he strike the little girl?

35:13.487 --> 35:16.113
- Well, no.
- Did he strike you?

35:17.032 --> 35:18.532
Not exactly.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.285
Not exactly?

35:24.247 --> 35:26.957
You know, there were times...

35:27.292 --> 35:29.376
when I thought he was going to...

35:29.628 --> 35:33.047
but I just didn't want to wait
until he got around to it.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.054
It's hard to explain.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.850
He could, I think.

35:45.352 --> 35:46.352
You think?

36:53.962 --> 36:55.629
Hello, sir.
How are you today?

36:55.964 --> 36:57.131
I'm doing all right.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.425
- How about you?
- Me? I'm terrible.

36:59.593 --> 37:00.593
I'm sorry.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.722
I came from Santa Barbara,
and my friend wasn't home...

37:04.931 --> 37:06.056
and he owes me money...

37:06.308 --> 37:08.350
so I have no money to go home.

37:08.602 --> 37:11.395
I'm almost out of gas.
I had to sleep in my car.

37:11.605 --> 37:14.607
Do you have a few bucks?
It would really help me out.

37:14.816 --> 37:17.651
Give me your address,
I'll mail it back. Honest.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.071
- Let me see your driver's license.
- What for?

37:21.323 --> 37:23.282
It'll have your address on it.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.744
- I don't have a license.
- You drove all the way without it?

37:26.953 --> 37:28.162
Are you a cop?

37:28.455 --> 37:30.664
Let's see your car registration
and your car.

37:30.916 --> 37:34.793
All right, forget it.
Okay, just forget it!

37:36.129 --> 37:38.589
That's a hell of a way
to treat a vet, man.

37:39.674 --> 37:44.094
- You're an animal doctor?
- No, a veteran. I was in Nam.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.764
You must've been 10 years old.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.308
I meant to say the Gulf.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.519
Come on! 
All I'm asking for is a little change.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.522
I haven't eaten in three days.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.150
Well, I mean, except for this.

37:58.610 --> 38:02.404
Fuck it! Give me some money, man.
Just give me some money.

38:03.156 --> 38:05.491
How about a dime?
Give it to me.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.034
I'm not giving you any.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.036
- You got a cigarette?
- No.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.623
- You gotta give me something.
- Why don't you get a job?

38:13.208 --> 38:15.209
This is my park. I live here!

38:15.502 --> 38:18.671
Who are you, 
walking through my park with two bags?

38:18.880 --> 38:21.048
I don't got any. 
Is that fair?

38:21.341 --> 38:24.343
What's in those bags, anyway?
Give me one.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.930
I could sell those bags
and eat for a week with the money.

38:28.181 --> 38:30.975
You've got two of them.
Why do you need two?

38:31.685 --> 38:33.185
You're right.

38:33.561 --> 38:34.561
Here.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.564
- Are you serious?
- I don't need it anymore.

38:39.818 --> 38:43.946
All right! Come on, now.
Come on. What the--

38:48.243 --> 38:50.703
Son of a bitch!

38:57.460 --> 39:00.754
- Can we cut the crap this time?
- I'm telling you the truth!

39:01.006 --> 39:02.381
Yeah, right.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.680
- What's up?
- She was at the drive-by.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.433
- Angie, who hit your guys?
- I told you.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.186
We know. The big bad white man.
We're not buying it.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.230
Who are you protecting?

39:19.107 --> 39:22.401
They put your boyfriend in the hospital.
He's probably dead.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.362
Do you realize that?
He's probably fucking dead!

39:25.613 --> 39:28.866
- Stop saying that!
- You picked a good day to leave.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.119
You want another 3-year-old
to get shot in the head?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.871
Is that what you want?

39:38.501 --> 39:39.793
Tell me the truth!

39:40.545 --> 39:42.796
I'm telling you the truth!

39:43.923 --> 39:45.049
It was a white guy!

39:45.300 --> 39:48.635
- Why would he go for your friends?
- I don't know!

39:48.803 --> 39:52.723
He attacked them on Angel's Flight Hill
with a baseball bat!

39:52.974 --> 39:54.933
A baseball bat?
Wait!

39:56.561 --> 39:58.896
Baseball bat.
What did this guy look like?

39:59.731 --> 40:02.066
I don't know.
He looked like you...

40:02.317 --> 40:04.068
except he was taller and had hair.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.153
Good description, Angie!

40:06.404 --> 40:08.155
Did he wear a white shirt and tie?

40:11.659 --> 40:12.993
Come over here, will you?

40:14.120 --> 40:17.414
We gotta keep the pressure on her.
Don't interrupt.

40:17.624 --> 40:18.749
What about the bat?

40:19.000 --> 40:22.002
- The white shirt and tie!
- What will she think of next?

40:22.170 --> 40:24.171
I'm sorry you're leaving,
but you are.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.509
- Sanchez, listen to me!
- Check me later, babe.

40:34.474 --> 40:35.808
Hey, Brian? 

40:36.017 --> 40:38.143
Remember that storekeeper,
the Korean guy?

40:38.353 --> 40:39.853
- Mr. Lee?
- Come here.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.272
Where was his place?

40:42.982 --> 40:44.191
Right there.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.652
He was assaulted sometime after 8 a.m.?

40:46.861 --> 40:50.864
- About that.
- And the drive-by was here, right?

40:51.116 --> 40:52.116
What's going on?

40:52.283 --> 40:56.495
I may be nuts, but Angel's Flight Hill
is between those two spots.

40:56.704 --> 41:00.165
- It was a classy neighborhood.
- It's a shit hole. Gangland.

41:00.375 --> 41:04.711
I know. What would a white guy
in a shirt and tie be doing in...

41:05.046 --> 41:06.338
gangland?

41:21.396 --> 41:22.688
Hi. Can I help you?

41:23.106 --> 41:27.067
I'd like a ham and cheese Whamlette,
an order of Wham fries--

41:27.318 --> 41:30.654
Sorry, we stopped serving breakfast.
We're on the lunch menu.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.573
I want breakfast.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.616
We're not serving it.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.244
So you said.

41:38.621 --> 41:39.663
Is that the manager?

41:40.081 --> 41:41.081
Yeah.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.916
Could I speak to him, please?

41:44.085 --> 41:45.127
Sure.

41:45.420 --> 41:48.005
Rick, a customer would like
to speak to you.

41:50.592 --> 41:53.260
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like some breakfast.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.929
We stopped serving breakfast.

41:56.181 --> 42:01.268
I know you stopped breakfast, Rick.
Sheila told me you stopped....

42:01.895 --> 42:04.730
Why am I calling you by first names?
I don't know you.

42:04.939 --> 42:09.610
I call my boss "mister" after 7 years,
but I walk in here, a stranger...

42:09.861 --> 42:14.031
and I'm calling you Rick and Sheila
like we're in an AA meeting.

42:15.033 --> 42:18.911
I don't want to be your buddy, Rick.
I just want a little breakfast.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.788
You can call me Miss Folsom
if you want to.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.958
We stopped serving breakfast at 11:30.

42:36.387 --> 42:40.641
Have you ever heard the expression,
"The customer is always right"?

42:41.226 --> 42:42.226
Yeah.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.896
Well, here I am.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.440
The customer.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.484
That's not our policy.

42:50.693 --> 42:53.820
You have to order something
from the lunch menu.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.491
I don't want lunch.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.076
I want breakfast.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.912
Yeah, well, hey, I'm really sorry.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.581
Yeah, well, hey, I'm really sorry too!

43:04.832 --> 43:06.166
He's got a gun!

43:07.418 --> 43:08.418
Let's get organized!

43:09.087 --> 43:10.087
Calm down!

43:10.338 --> 43:13.215
Just calm down, everybody.
Sit down over there!

43:14.342 --> 43:15.968
Mister.

43:17.303 --> 43:18.720
Where are you going?

43:18.930 --> 43:21.932
No. You sit down there,
and you finish your lunch.

43:22.308 --> 43:26.103
Everybody just relax and take it easy.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.940
Eat your lunch. Please.

43:30.149 --> 43:32.234
You all need your vitamins A, B and--

43:34.362 --> 43:36.613
Don't! It was an accident!

43:36.823 --> 43:40.200
It's the trigger, it's sensitive.
It's okay!

43:42.745 --> 43:44.538
It's a sensitive trigger.

43:49.544 --> 43:50.961
Could I have my breakfast?

43:51.212 --> 43:53.297
Yes, sir. Sheila?

44:01.806 --> 44:04.391
Rick? Miss Folsom?

44:05.018 --> 44:06.310
You know what?

44:06.561 --> 44:08.395
You were right.
I've changed my mind.

44:09.022 --> 44:10.897
I'm going to have some lunch.

44:11.316 --> 44:14.526
Could I have 
a double Whammyburger with cheese--

44:14.861 --> 44:17.070
- You getting this?
- Yes, sir.

44:17.322 --> 44:20.866
And an order of Whammy fries
and, let's see...

44:21.075 --> 44:22.659
a Choco-Wham shake.

44:23.161 --> 44:25.412
Yes, sir.
Sheila, get his order.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.873
Rick, could you get it for me, please?

44:28.833 --> 44:33.754
I feel comfortable calling you Rick
after all we've been through together.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.802
How you doing?

44:41.512 --> 44:43.347
Enjoying your meal?

44:45.725 --> 44:48.352
How about you?
Is it good?

44:52.482 --> 44:54.358
And you, ma'am? How's the food?

44:56.986 --> 44:58.612
I think we have a critic.

45:01.032 --> 45:03.867
I don't think she likes the special sauce.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.454
That's a joke.

45:08.498 --> 45:09.956
Now, here we go.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.458
Thank you.

45:15.505 --> 45:17.631
See, this is what I'm talking about.

45:18.216 --> 45:19.216
Look at that.

45:19.884 --> 45:23.220
See what I mean?
It's plump, juicy, three inches thick.

45:27.183 --> 45:31.103
Look at this sorry, miserable, 
squashed thing.

45:31.854 --> 45:34.898
Can anybody tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

45:36.109 --> 45:37.859
Anybody?

45:38.903 --> 45:40.570
Anybody at all.

45:51.499 --> 45:53.250
You guys are partners again!

45:53.501 --> 45:56.753
No such luck, Lita.
He's moving to Lake Havasu.

45:57.088 --> 45:59.756
- What's in Lake Havasu?
- London Bridge.

46:00.007 --> 46:03.301
- Are you going to England?
- They moved it to Arizona.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.888
- Stone by stone.
- Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

46:07.140 --> 46:10.016
You're better off,
because cops get killed.

46:10.643 --> 46:12.811
- What'd we used to get, six?
- Seven.

46:13.104 --> 46:14.771
Two sevens.

46:19.902 --> 46:22.529
- You all right?
- Yeah.

46:24.323 --> 46:25.657
You sure?

46:27.660 --> 46:28.660
What?

46:33.207 --> 46:35.876
I'm sorry, I wasn't gonna do this.

46:36.127 --> 46:38.712
I should just shut up.
It's none of my business.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.422
Tell me.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.467
Lake Havasu?

46:44.594 --> 46:46.094
It's nice. We like it.

46:46.345 --> 46:47.637
She likes it.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.056
What'll you do, watch cactus grow?

46:50.475 --> 46:51.725
Cacti.

46:55.062 --> 46:57.230
She's not handling middle age too well.

46:57.482 --> 47:01.234
The change of life and all that,
whatever it is that is.

47:02.612 --> 47:03.653
What about you?

47:03.863 --> 47:06.698
Me? It's different,
because she's a woman.

47:07.909 --> 47:09.117
Different? I'm a woman.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.578
But she was once very beautiful.

47:13.247 --> 47:14.414
Thanks a lot!

47:14.665 --> 47:17.375
You know what I mean.
Come on, come on.

47:17.585 --> 47:20.170
She could've been anything.
Anything but a cop's wife.

47:20.421 --> 47:21.463
She's high-strung.

47:21.672 --> 47:25.675
Don't give me that queen of the hop,
homecoming queen bullshit again.

47:26.385 --> 47:27.761
That was a long time ago.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.722
Sandra, you have a career.

47:31.182 --> 47:34.267
It's hard to lose your beauty
when that's all you've got.

47:34.477 --> 47:35.810
What about your career?

47:36.812 --> 47:38.438
I'll be okay...

47:38.689 --> 47:40.899
you know, even without you.

47:47.156 --> 47:48.365
Sorry to break this up.

47:48.616 --> 47:50.700
- Why are you here?
- We got a call.

47:50.910 --> 47:52.369
Watch out! Hot plates!

47:52.662 --> 47:55.372
- Don't touch my gun.
- Fuck you!

47:55.623 --> 47:58.959
You'll love this one.
Some dickhead went into Whammyburger...

47:59.210 --> 48:01.711
pulled out a gun
when he couldn't get breakfast.

48:01.963 --> 48:04.464
Then he paid for it and left.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.967
- Sorry, Prendergast.
- He paid for it?

48:07.176 --> 48:09.344
Yeah. Move your buns.
Let's go.

48:09.554 --> 48:10.554
I gotta go.

48:10.846 --> 48:11.972
Where was this?

48:12.181 --> 48:14.933
Quintero and Fourth.
Bye, ladies.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.436
Wait a minute. Wait, wait!

48:18.813 --> 48:21.982
Let me know what this guy 
was wearing, okay?

48:22.191 --> 48:26.236
You trying to crack a big one
before you disappear into the desert?

48:26.487 --> 48:29.739
Sandra, find out if he's wearing
a white shirt and tie.

48:29.991 --> 48:31.449
Let's go, lovebirds.

48:31.659 --> 48:33.451
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

48:34.453 --> 48:37.163
Something about my wife.
Maybe I never mentioned it.

48:39.041 --> 48:40.166
What?

48:42.837 --> 48:44.504
I love her.

48:45.548 --> 48:47.424
Let's go!

49:14.827 --> 49:16.703
For seven years, I banked here.

49:16.912 --> 49:20.582
When I asked them for a loan,
a small loan...

49:20.875 --> 49:24.794
they told me that I was not
"economically viable."

49:34.221 --> 49:36.306
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

49:36.557 --> 49:39.351
How'd your loan work out?
Did they give you a loan?

49:40.728 --> 49:42.520
He must be economically viable!

49:42.772 --> 49:45.857
There's a man with a smiling face.
A happy customer.

49:46.233 --> 49:49.778
That's what an economically
viable person looks like!

50:01.749 --> 50:03.333
How much is the...?

50:03.793 --> 50:05.627
That is only $3.

50:09.882 --> 50:12.967
I asked them for a small loan.
You know what they told me?

50:13.260 --> 50:15.762
I was not economically viable.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.014
That's enough.

50:19.141 --> 50:22.310
- I'll buy this.
- Yes, sir. That is $3.

50:30.653 --> 50:34.280
I'm going away now!
I'm going away, everybody!

50:34.490 --> 50:39.411
This is what happens
if you're not economically viable!

50:50.131 --> 50:51.965
Don't let this happen to you!

50:53.134 --> 50:54.509
Bye, everybody!

50:59.807 --> 51:00.807
Don't forget me.

51:20.995 --> 51:22.162
I'm sorry.

51:23.706 --> 51:24.831
We're leaving now.

51:25.332 --> 51:26.541
You are? Really?

51:26.751 --> 51:29.502
It doesn't look like
your husband's gonna show.

51:29.754 --> 51:34.591
He probably realized he could get 
into trouble if he harassed you.

51:34.925 --> 51:38.011
You should call your lawyer
and tell him about it.

51:38.345 --> 51:41.848
It's one of those services.
I didn't have much money.

51:42.057 --> 51:46.019
Have them call your husband's lawyer,
make it official.

51:46.562 --> 51:51.149
In the meantime, lock up.
And if anything else happens, call us.

51:51.358 --> 51:53.860
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure thing.

52:07.875 --> 52:10.293
Excuse me. Hey, excuse me!

52:10.628 --> 52:14.547
If you haven't noticed,
others are waiting to use the phone.

52:14.965 --> 52:17.258
- Others want the phone?
- Right, asshole!

52:17.593 --> 52:20.762
Jeez, that's too bad,
because you know what?

52:26.393 --> 52:28.478
I think it's out of order.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.280
Yeah, Prendergast.

52:39.532 --> 52:40.698
Hi, it's me.

52:40.950 --> 52:43.409
He's eating and resting comfortably now.

52:43.577 --> 52:44.786
<i>- Who is?</i>
- Mr. Peepers.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.913
<i>- Good!</i>
- I'm sorry about before.

52:47.248 --> 52:49.165
I really blew my top....

52:49.416 --> 52:52.293
That's okay, honey.
Could you hold on one second?

52:52.670 --> 52:54.754
- Prendergast.
- White shirt and tie.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.214
Could you hold on?

52:56.465 --> 52:57.549
I gotta go.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.718
Just one second.
It's very important.

53:01.428 --> 53:03.930
Detective Torres!
Excuse me.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.517
We have about 7 million people
waiting to make a statement.

53:08.811 --> 53:10.270
Let me call you right back.

53:10.521 --> 53:12.230
What's wrong?
What are you doing?

53:12.481 --> 53:15.275
Nothing's wrong.
What do you mean?

53:15.693 --> 53:18.069
- You come home then.
<i>- I can't.</i>

53:18.320 --> 53:21.364
It's your last day.
What are they going to do, fire you?

53:21.615 --> 53:25.159
There's a lot of red tape.
As soon as I get done, I can go home.

53:25.369 --> 53:27.537
I'll call you in a while, okay?

53:27.788 --> 53:29.831
Wait a minute. Make a list.

53:30.082 --> 53:32.458
- A list?
<i>- We need boneless chicken...</i>

53:32.710 --> 53:34.085
skinless. Red peppers...

53:34.336 --> 53:35.879
<i>not green, red.</i>

53:36.088 --> 53:38.006
Honey, hold on one second.

53:39.091 --> 53:40.967
I am tying up the phone here.

53:41.302 --> 53:43.761
<i>Just listen for once in your life.</i>

53:44.638 --> 53:47.682
<i>A girl at the drive-by 
said a man in a shirt and tie...</i>

53:47.975 --> 53:50.852
attacked her homeboys with a baseball bat.

53:51.061 --> 53:53.146
Somebody's let that dog off the leash.

53:53.981 --> 53:55.815
I think you've got last-day-itis.

53:56.025 --> 53:59.277
This man was not swinging a bat.
He has a gym bag full of guns.

53:59.445 --> 54:00.987
Miss, do you work here? 

54:01.238 --> 54:02.697
A gym bag?

54:03.699 --> 54:06.492
You asked me to tell you what he wore. 
I gotta run.

54:06.702 --> 54:08.411
We have to canvass the neighborhood.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.163
<i>One more second.</i>

54:10.497 --> 54:11.831
Please. It's important.

54:13.208 --> 54:15.585
<i>- Why don't you go to the store?</i>
- Why?

54:15.836 --> 54:17.295
It's my last day.

54:17.546 --> 54:20.506
The guys might want to have
a send off or something.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.884
What're they gonna do?
Get some broad...

54:23.135 --> 54:25.887
<i>with tassels dangling,
dancing on your desk?</i>

54:26.096 --> 54:27.847
Course not.

54:28.265 --> 54:31.059
Look, while you have been playing cop...

54:31.268 --> 54:33.853
I'm at home planning your retirement.

54:34.063 --> 54:36.856
It's over. 
The sooner you get that, the better.

54:37.650 --> 54:41.069
<i>You are no longer
in the law-enforcement business.</i>

54:41.320 --> 54:44.656
Now, I will expect you
at the usual time. <i>Capito?</i>

54:46.408 --> 54:49.118
Sandra, are you mad at me?

54:50.162 --> 54:52.747
- I hate you, but I'm not mad.
- You retiring too?

54:57.461 --> 55:00.254
Just don't leave without saying goodbye.

55:00.547 --> 55:01.839
Goodbye.

55:02.216 --> 55:04.717
If you go up against this guy...

55:05.344 --> 55:06.344
be careful.

56:29.553 --> 56:31.220
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:31.638 --> 56:33.139
I'm Nick.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.142
What can I do you for?

56:36.310 --> 56:38.478
I'm just looking for some hiking boots.

56:38.729 --> 56:41.397
Well, well. 
Hiking boots, huh?

56:41.648 --> 56:43.983
Let's see what we got.

56:44.193 --> 56:45.902
These are the top of the line.

56:46.153 --> 56:49.030
Scientifically engineered
and all that crap.

56:49.239 --> 56:52.784
Guaranteed by some Sierra Club asshole 
not to hurt a chipmunk...

56:52.993 --> 56:54.827
if you step on it.

56:55.037 --> 56:57.830
Personally, I think they're
for pussies and faggots!

56:59.249 --> 57:00.792
Now these...

57:01.251 --> 57:03.002
are Vietnam jungle boots.

57:03.670 --> 57:07.048
Cost half as much,
last twice as long and are great...

57:07.299 --> 57:09.258
for stomping queers!

57:09.468 --> 57:13.554
When you're done, you gotta clean out 
the waffle with a stick...

57:13.806 --> 57:16.307
but you can't have everything, right?

57:17.351 --> 57:18.768
Forget it.

57:19.895 --> 57:21.187
Come on, let's go.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.981
Have a nice day, fellas!

57:24.233 --> 57:26.567
Y'all come back now, you hear?

57:27.319 --> 57:28.736
You got a problem, buddy?

57:29.488 --> 57:32.907
- Huh? Huh?
- Uh-uh. 

57:33.534 --> 57:34.700
You got the problem!

57:34.868 --> 57:37.370
- No, you do, buddy!
- Read the sign!

57:37.621 --> 57:39.497
"I reserve the right."

57:40.332 --> 57:41.624
Now take a hike.

57:42.084 --> 57:43.584
Make me.

57:44.920 --> 57:48.381
Take it easy, Mary.
Take it easy.

57:49.341 --> 57:52.051
- Jesus!
- Come on, make your play.

57:52.344 --> 57:55.888
Would you just come on!
I don't need this shit today.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.266
Fucking redneck!

57:59.893 --> 58:01.227
Fascist!

58:05.357 --> 58:07.650
Fucking faggots!

58:07.860 --> 58:09.735
You believe this shit?

58:11.113 --> 58:12.989
Jesus!

58:13.657 --> 58:16.534
Alternate lifestyle, my ass!

58:17.786 --> 58:21.372
Imagine what those pumpkins do 
with each other when they're alone!

58:21.748 --> 58:25.585
And what about the muff divers?
Think about it.

58:28.881 --> 58:31.257
- Sergeant Prendergast.
- She don't have to talk!

58:32.676 --> 58:35.303
What do you want?
I admitted it was a gang!

58:35.554 --> 58:37.305
She don't have to say a word!

58:37.681 --> 58:42.393
I know it was a white guy.
We gotta talk. It's important.

58:45.063 --> 58:48.274
How many guns were in the gym bag?

58:48.525 --> 58:52.111
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see no gym bag!

58:52.654 --> 58:55.865
The white guy took it, right?
More people could get hurt.

58:56.116 --> 58:57.617
Now help me out.

58:59.995 --> 59:02.872
The bag was already in the car
when I got in.

59:03.123 --> 59:04.582
How many guns were in it?

59:04.791 --> 59:06.292
I don't know.

59:08.295 --> 59:10.129
Lots of guns.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.882
They got all the guns
in the fucking world.

59:37.616 --> 59:38.658
Good?

59:41.453 --> 59:42.453
Hi.

59:42.913 --> 59:45.039
Hi.
Can I help you?

59:45.332 --> 59:47.541
Police officer.
I'm looking for a man.

59:48.126 --> 59:49.752
Are you now?

59:50.837 --> 59:51.837
Late 30s...

59:52.339 --> 59:53.547
white shirt and tie...

59:54.508 --> 59:56.634
he'd be carrying a gym bag.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.100
What's the police scanner for?

01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:06.727
My own personal amusement.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.356
Seen anyone like I've described?

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:11.565
Nope.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.360
- Okay, thanks.
- Listen.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.445
Tell me something.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.031
Why don't they call you guys...

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.617
officer-esses?

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.286
I beg your pardon?

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:27.498
You know, like actress?
Like that?

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.003
Something to signify...

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:34.588
you know.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:40.886
I guess they feel that a police officer
is a police officer...

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.805
not a...

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.224
"you know."

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.644
Thanks for your cooperation, sir.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:52.273
Sorry I couldn't be of more help, 
officer-ess.

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:02.742
Why'd you do that?

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.619
There's something I wanna show you.

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:09.957
I'm not gonna turn you in.
I'm your friend.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.126
Come on.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.838
I don't bring just anybody back here.

01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:18.799
This is my own private stash.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.927
I got some great stuff here.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:29.977
Boo!
World War I. Good shape.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:33.731
Speaking of gas, wait a minute.

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:35.941
Wait just a minute.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:47.995
You know what was in this?

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.122
Zyklon-B.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:52.375
You remember?

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:53.751
What the Nazis had?

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.296
Listen.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:01.467
Empty.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:03.386
This was used, man.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:07.181
This was actually used.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:12.186
I wonder how many kikes
this little can took out.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:15.773
Think about it. 
Here.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.864
Why are you showing me this?

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:25.324
I'm not.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.495
That's just for fun.
You can keep that.

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:35.000
This is what I want to show you.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.670
The real thing.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.049
Heat-seeking, shoulder-fired.
It's fucking disposable!

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.927
You can take out a jet
with one of these monkeys.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.681
It's for you.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:52.351
- I want you to have it.
- Why?

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.728
Because I'm with you.

01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:56.439
Don't you get it?

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.650
I listened to the scanner.
I heard about Whammyburger.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:02.611
Fucking fantastic!

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:07.241
It's a bunch of niggers, right?
On TV, it's always white kids.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:10.911
But when you go in there,
it's nothing but a bunch of niggers!

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:14.081
They'll spit on your food
if you're not nice.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.333
I know all about it.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.378
I'm with you.

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:22.047
We're the same, you and me.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.966
We're the same. Don't you see?

01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:26.635
We are not the same.

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:29.680
I'm an American.
You're a sick asshole.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.101
What kind of vigilante are you?

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:37.146
I am not a vigilante.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:40.691
I'm just trying to get home
for my little girl's birthday.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:46.071
And if everybody will stay out of my way, 
nobody will get hurt.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.240
Fuck you!

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:51.243
Who the fuck are you?
Are you fucking with me?

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:54.121
I am just disagreeing with you!

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:58.626
In America, we have freedom of speech,
the right to disagree!

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.878
Fuck you and your freedom!

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.755
Who the fuck are you?

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:05.090
You fuck!
You faggot fuck!

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.717
Gonna take my rocket.

01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:10.471
I ought to shoot you, motherfucker!
Now turn around!

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:13.307
Now lean on that counter!
Go on, lean on it!

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.899
Look at this shit!

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.530
What is this doing in there?

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:29.990
- Faggot shit!
- No!

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:36.163
You want freedom, huh?
I'll give you fucking freedom!

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:39.041
Further back.
Feet farther back.

01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:42.002
Spread them out.
Farther.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:46.131
You're going to jail, motherfucker!
How's that for freedom?

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:49.385
Freedom to get fucked up the ass
by some big buck nigger.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:50.886
Give me your hand.

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:59.353
He's gonna be right behind you,
just like this.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:03.774
Think about it.
You gonna like that, faggot?

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:08.028
You gonna like that, you faggot fuck?
Give me your other hand.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.281
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.574
Gravity.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:14.034
Gravity?
What the fuck does that mean?

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.828
I'll fall down.

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:20.958
Now give me your other hand!
Give it to me now!

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.460
Give it to me! 
Give it to me!

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:24.878
Come on. Come on.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.839
Give it to me.

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.808
Aah!

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:48.444
This isn't one of mine.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.629
Oh, my God!

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:11.050
- Oh, my God!
- Good!

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:13.010
Freedom of religion.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.012
Now you get the swing of it!

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:17.931
Feels good to exercise your rights.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.112
I'm listening.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:35.032
We got a nutcase
with a bag full of guns.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:37.785
He's in Hollywood, heading west.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.161
What is he up to?

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:41.538
He's up to a lot of trouble.

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:45.459
Never mind, we've got a hallway 
full of suspects.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:48.337
It wasn't a gang thing.
I can tell you that.

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:50.673
Angelina is a tramp and a liar.

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:54.301
We don't appreciate you interfering
with our investigation.

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:58.847
I've got a positive ID
on the gym bag, okay?

01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:02.810
What's this?

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.311
A gym bag.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:07.606
Does this mean you're putting me 
under arrest?

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:11.985
You guys take off.

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.991
I gave you that speech earlier...

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:21.704
because that's regulations.
They make me do it.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.707
This one's from me.
I've never liked you.

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:29.002
You know why? You don't curse.
I don't trust a man who doesn't curse.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:33.924
Not a "fuck" or a "shit" in all these years. 
Real men curse.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:37.302
And I don't like a man
who's afraid to hit the street.

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:40.055
- It's bad for morale.
- I'm not afraid.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.641
Get back behind that desk
where you belong...

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:46.812
and don't waste any more of my time
pretending you're a cop.

01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:57.322
A man in a white shirt and tie shot up
a phone booth near the Whammyburger.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.993
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:03.954
Right about here, right?

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.831
How did you know?

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.333
He got the bag of guns at the drive-by.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:09.835
Then you were right.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.253
Excuse me.

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:14.089
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.216
I'm a coward, the captain told me.
Get out of my way.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.386
Hey, look. It is your own fault.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.555
You let everybody think that,
when it was your wife.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.850
She made you get off the street.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.229
What happens between me and my wife
is nobody's business but mine!

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:31.648
Sorry, I've been a bitch all day.

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:34.859
She didn't make me quit.
I came home late one night...

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:37.154
and found her sitting in the dark.

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:39.072
She thought I'd been killed.

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:42.868
She thought I was a ghost.
I had to chase her all over the house.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.122
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:52.002
- Where are you going?
- See if I can earn my last day's pay.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.962
Let me go with you.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.090
I thought you were on duty.

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:01.886
What do you say, partner?

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:05.390
Fuck them!

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.060
Go!

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:22.533
Hello?

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.286
<i>Who were you talking to a while ago?</i>

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.707
You're trying to scare me.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.460
Am I succeeding?

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:37.548
<i>No, you're not succeeding.
So you just might as well stop it.</i>

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:41.468
<i>And you're not scaring me
out of my own house.</i>

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:42.928
<i>And you're not coming here.</i>

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:47.765
But I am. I'm on my way.
You can count on that.

01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:52.563
I'm past the point of no return.

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:56.108
Do you know when that is?

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:59.945
That's the point in a journey...

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:03.073
where it's longer to go back
to the beginning...

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:05.993
than it is to continue to the end.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.037
It's like....

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:12.040
Remember when those astronauts 
got in trouble?

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.961
They were going to the moon
and something went wrong.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.671
They had to get back to Earth...

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:21.216
but they had passed the point 
of no return.

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:26.388
<i>So they had to go all the way
around the moon to get back...</i>

01:10:26.598 --> 01:10:30.809
<i>and they were out of contact for hours.</i>

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:35.814
Everybody waited to see
if a bunch of dead guys in a can...

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:38.233
would pop out the other side.

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:43.655
That's me.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.618
On the other side of the moon now...

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:50.120
out of contact...

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:55.042
and everybody's just going
to have to wait till I pop out.

01:10:58.129 --> 01:10:59.922
The police are here.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.383
<i>Did you know, Beth...</i>

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:07.888
that in certain South American countries 
it's still legal...

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.849
to kill your wife if she insults you?

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:17.064
They're here right now.
I'm looking at one right now.

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:18.815
Put him on the phone.

01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:39.336
- What are we gonna do?
- Talk to the Korean guy.

01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:43.298
Then we just start banging on doors.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:56.853
What is it?

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:02.484
Where are you going?

01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:04.361
I'll be right back.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:09.783
I'm sure the guy 
will let you use his bathroom.

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:25.298
Prendergast, what are you doing?

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:39.021
- I know who this guy is!
- Who is he?

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:43.400
He had a personalized license plate.
What the hell was it?

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.736
It said, "D-Fens."

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:47.112
Defense?

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:51.366
D-dash-F-E-N-S.
"D-Fens."

01:12:51.743 --> 01:12:55.412
They said he was on his way home.
Go check out his address.

01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:56.955
Mr. Lee!

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.000
Defense!

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.221
Honey, honey. No, no. 

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:29.279
Hold it! Back up.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:36.161
You dumb bitch! You cut me off!
What's wrong with you!

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.038
Move back! 
Out of the way!

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.706
What are you, a moron?

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:44.878
If I wanted to be in a parking lot,
I'd buy a ticket, you dumb bitch!

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.274
You can't come this way.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.110
What are you doing?

01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:10.779
Fixing the street!
What does it look like?

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.324
Two days ago, it was fine.

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:16.785
You're saying it fell apart in two days?

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.204
Well, I guess so.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:22.124
Pardon me, but that's bullshit!

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:26.378
I don't think anything's wrong 
with the street.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.755
You're trying to justify your budgets.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.841
- Are you nuts?
- I know how it works.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:35.303
If you don't spend your budget,
you won't get any money next year.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.598
I want you to admit
nothing's wrong with the street!

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.225
Fuck you, pal!

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:45.355
You're not gonna hold us hostage 
with these yellow lights and big trucks.

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:50.443
I'm just here to keep people 
from falling in. That's all.

01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:52.863
I want to hear it from you.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.991
What's wrong with the street?

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:59.578
I don't know. I really don't.
I think it's a sewer job.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.455
You're lying.

01:15:02.957 --> 01:15:05.041
What's wrong with the street?

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420
Nothing.

01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:12.257
I knew it.

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:14.926
See, I knew it was fine.

01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:18.763
But I'll give you something to fix.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.057
- Oh, Jesus--
- Here!

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:24.853
Hey, Charlie!
Oh, please, man!

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:27.147
We got a goddamn nut here!

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.484
Fucking guy back there with a bazooka!

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:32.777
Pull that thing off.

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:34.154
- What thing?
- That.

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:36.990
Then pull on both ends.
It gets bigger.

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:39.201
Like this?

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:42.287
Now flip that thing up.
It's your aimer.

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:43.496
How do you know?

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.498
I saw it on TV.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.667
What's the name of the movie?

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:50.003
What's the movie you're making?

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.673
<i>Under Construction.</i> 
You like it?

01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:56.092
It's all right.
Where's the cameras?

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:59.179
The cameras are on.
Just stand back.

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:02.933
What do I do now?

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:07.395
Just look through the aimer.
What you aiming at?

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.316
That yellow monster down there.

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:14.945
Look at it and pull the trigger.
It's really easy.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:16.905
Trigger?

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:20.242
That one right there.

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:22.953
But aim first, man.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.664
Look out!

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:35.257
- Nothing happened.
- Must have been a dud or something.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:48.853
Cool, man!

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.616
What is it?
I'll sic the dog on you!

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:04.035
Police officers, ma'am.

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:17.590
How are you?

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:19.926
Where's the dog?

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:25.098
He's dead.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:30.312
- What is it?
- We need to ask some questions.

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:32.897
Just a few questions, ma'am.

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:35.025
What kind of questions?

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:37.027
Do you have a warrant?

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:38.737
You invited us in.

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:41.281
Now I'm inviting you out.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:43.950
What relation are you to William Foster?

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.288
What are you saying? He's my son. 
I don't want you here.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:51.750
Would you look at this?
This is really amazing.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:52.917
Amazing!

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:57.005
Does he have another house,
another place he might call home?

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:58.715
Now, this is a what?

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:01.009
- A dragon?
- Don't touch that!

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:05.347
Why would he do that?
This is his home.

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:08.516
- I want you to go now.
- Did this one melt?

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:10.560
That one.

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:18.276
It's a giraffe, drinking.

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:20.195
Mm-hm.

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:24.741
Now, of all of these,
which is your very favorite?

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:31.039
Right now, I think this skunk.

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.874
That's lovely.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.168
That's not paint.

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.045
You know, his stripe.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:38.296
It isn't?

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:40.965
It might be, but it's not painted on.

01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:44.052
It's in the glass.

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:28.096
What the hell?

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:31.057
It's the groundskeeper.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:34.686
Well, if he is, he's out of uniform. 
Hey, you there!

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:37.230
What are you doing there?

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:39.023
Just passing through.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:43.194
Nobody said you could play through.
Get off my hole.

01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:45.613
He said he was passing through.

01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:47.824
He's not a member.
Look how he's dressed.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.742
Get off my golf course!

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:51.870
I am!

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.913
Go back the way you came!

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.708
I don't like his looks.
Leave him alone.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:59.586
What am I paying dues for?
This is my golf course!

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.380
If I want to play here, I will!

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:05.550
If he gets hit with my Titleist,
that's his problem!

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:08.470
Don't yell at me.
I'm just here playing with you--

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:10.388
Fore!

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:12.807
Fore!

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:20.565
Five!

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:22.233
Wait a minute!

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:26.279
What the hell you trying to do?
Kill me with a golf ball?

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:29.699
It's not enough you got all this land 
for your little game?

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:32.619
But you had to kill me
with a golf ball?

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:36.915
You should have children playing here.
Family picnics.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:39.125
You should have a petting zoo...

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.672
instead of electric carts for you old men 
with nothing better to do.

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.848
Frank, what's wrong? 
Frank!

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.602
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:00.855
- I gotta get some help!
- What's wrong with you?

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:03.149
- Help!
- Your heart?

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.277
Something's wrong with your heart?
What can I do?

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:09.614
Pills! Pills!

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:10.782
Pills?

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:12.617
Where are they?

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:14.953
Cart, cart.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:21.209
Call the paramedics!
My friend just had a heart attack!

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:25.338
I guess you're out of luck.
Your little cart's gonna drown.

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:29.509
Aren't you sorry you didn't let me pass 
through your golf course?

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:36.808
Now you're gonna die wearing that stupid 
little hat. How does it feel?

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:42.855
This is his room.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.650
You're a very neat and tidy lady.

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:48.403
He cleans his own room.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:51.072
Now don't make me call you a liar.

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:56.369
If he wasn't at work,
I'd be afraid to set foot in here.

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.246
What's he been doing lately?

01:21:58.455 --> 01:21:59.914
Same as ever.

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:03.918
Building important things 
to protect us from the Communists.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.296
He works at Notec.

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:08.506
The defense plant.

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:10.675
D-Fens.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:13.886
Call Notec and see if you can get him.

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.602
So what's going on with your son?

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.691
- How do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

01:22:31.322 --> 01:22:34.991
Sometimes he sits through an entire meal 
without saying a word.

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:41.456
He just shovels food into his mouth 
like a machine.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:43.750
I get so nervous...

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.461
I can't swallow.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:50.423
I'll sit there with
the same piece of food in my mouth.

01:22:51.759 --> 01:22:54.761
I have to spit it out.
When I do, he looks at me...

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.513
like he'd like to kill me.

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.351
Don't tell him I said that.

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.978
I promise I won't.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:08.775
I try not to be a burden.
I'm not just talking financial.

01:23:09.068 --> 01:23:11.736
How could you be a burden to anyone?

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:15.782
If William, or Bill,
as I like to call him--

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:18.951
He likes Bill.
I call him Bill too.

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:20.953
If Bill said he was going home...

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:24.248
could he have meant
where his wife and child live?

01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:26.959
Ex-wife.
We shouldn't be in here.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:32.590
Ex-wife, right. Elizabeth.
What's her maiden name?

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.760
Trevino. She was part Italian.
You know how they are.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:38.513
- Where's Elizabeth now?
- I wouldn't know.

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:42.308
You don't know where your grandchild lives?

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:48.189
He doesn't want me to know.
He blames me for what happened.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.026
What's the word?

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.823
- He was fired over a month ago.
- What?

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:07.375
Where has he been going every day?

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.294
Where has he been eating his lunch?

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:26.310
Why are you putting barbed wire 
on that fence?

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.562
Is it a joke?

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:31.399
Is this how rich people have fun?
You put barbed wire on the fence...

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:34.694
so innocent people like me
can cut our hands?

01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:38.865
No, please. I'm the caretaker.

01:24:39.116 --> 01:24:40.658
It's just a barbecue.

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:44.328
Dr. Ashcroft has let us do this before.

01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:47.623
You don't live here?

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.084
Is it really necessary to tell them?

01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:52.670
Tell who?

01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:54.881
Altmore Security.

01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:58.259
Aren't you with them?

01:25:07.478 --> 01:25:09.353
No, please!

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:12.607
It's okay, honey.
It's okay, baby.

01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:27.997
What kind of doctor lives here?

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:30.917
Plastic surgeon.

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:36.964
Plastic surgery bought all this?

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:41.219
Guess I'm in the wrong racket.

01:25:43.514 --> 01:25:46.641
Are there correspondence courses
in plastic surgery?

01:25:51.522 --> 01:25:53.523
I lost my job.

01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:57.026
Actually, I didn't lose it.
It lost me.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:01.572
I'm overeducated, underskilled....

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:06.577
Maybe it's the other way around.
I forget.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:08.746
And I'm obsolete.

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:13.960
I'm not economically viable.

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:20.633
I can't even support my own kid.

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:25.513
Are you hurt? 
I'm sorry.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:27.974
I didn't hurt you, honey.
I'm sorry.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:31.435
It's all right. It's your hand.

01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:34.605
You cut your hand.

01:26:37.818 --> 01:26:39.610
It's my hand.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.701
- Please take me with you.
- No!

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:50.955
They won't do anything
if I'm with you.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:54.000
Just please let them go.

01:26:57.838 --> 01:27:01.382
What do you think?
You think I want to hurt your family?

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:07.346
I have a family of my own.

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:10.308
You don't believe me?

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:13.185
We believe you.

01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:20.693
That's where I'm going.
I'm going home to see my family.

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:26.991
It's my little girl's birthday today.

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:32.788
We were gonna have a barbecue,
like you guys...

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:36.751
and she was gonna play outside...

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:40.713
and my wife would hold my hand...

01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:44.675
and talk about grownup things.

01:27:48.722 --> 01:27:50.932
And then when it got dark...

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:54.685
we'd all go to sleep together.

01:27:57.356 --> 01:27:59.899
We'd all sleep together in the dark.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:04.528
And everything...

01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:08.032
would be just like it was before.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:21.045
You can't leave. Believe me,
something's happened to him.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:24.340
It doesn't take all day
to drive from Pasadena to Venice.

01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:27.718
That doesn't constitute
a threatening phone call.

01:28:27.928 --> 01:28:30.388
The guy was talking 
about <i>Star Trek</i> or something.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:34.141
- He's getting a kick out of scaring you.
- Please don't leave.

01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:38.062
There's only one thing you can do
to really feel safer.

01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:40.231
Next time there's a proposition...

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:44.819
to cut the number of patrol cars 
on the street, vote no, okay?

01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:47.029
Have a nice day.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:06.007
What have you found so far?

01:29:06.216 --> 01:29:07.717
No luck on Foster-Trevino.

01:29:07.968 --> 01:29:10.386
Go straight to the maiden name.

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:13.597
I've got something on an Army-Navy store.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:16.434
- Where?
- Here.

01:29:17.728 --> 01:29:20.354
Jesus, Prendergast, I was there!

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:22.106
That guy was a prick.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:23.983
You know what else he was?

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:28.112
Murdered. They found him stuffed
in his own display case.

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.822
Oh, my God!

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:31.240
Here, I'll help you.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:39.790
Hello?

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:41.876
You know what they did?

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:46.964
They turned our ice-cream parlor 
into a Southwest American, New Age thing.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.133
<i>I went to buy a rocking horse.</i>

01:29:49.342 --> 01:29:52.970
All I could find was a unicorn
with an Indian on top of it.

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:56.223
Can you believe that, Elizabeth?
Can you believe it?

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:00.352
Come on!

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:03.481
Where are we going?
When's my birthday?

01:30:48.568 --> 01:30:51.821
Some G.I. Joe gave a geezer a heart attack 
at the golf course...

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:54.740
and accosted a family
right next door.

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:55.908
A G.I. Joe?

01:30:56.118 --> 01:31:00.496
He's wearing the kind of jacket
you find in an Army-Navy store.

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:05.209
- I found her! Trevino, Elizabeth.
- Don't tell me.

01:31:06.086 --> 01:31:07.086
Venice.

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:09.713
How'd you know?

01:31:09.923 --> 01:31:12.341
Where else would an Italian move to?

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:15.511
<i>Look what I got.</i>

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:22.017
<i>We got a puppy.
We got a puppy.</i>

01:31:23.937 --> 01:31:27.231
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:31.443
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:47.960
<i>Hi, puppy!</i>

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.641
No answer at the ex-wife.

01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:05.769
- You send the cavalry?
- No, Pacific Division are pricks.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:09.773
They can't send units to the same address 
three times in a day...

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.692
to comfort some hysterical woman.

01:32:11.902 --> 01:32:14.320
- What do you want to do?
- Go to Venice.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:17.865
Prendergast here.

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:19.200
Who the fuck is this?

01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:21.702
Shit. It's your wife.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:23.329
Oh, boy. Hon?

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.290
Yeah, "hon." 
I know who that was!

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:28.959
Mr. Peepers just scratched
the shit out of me...

01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:31.295
and I'm bleeding like a stuck pig.

01:32:31.922 --> 01:32:33.714
Something important's come up.

01:32:34.216 --> 01:32:36.091
What am I? Dog vomit?

01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:38.344
Your wife says she's bleeding to death...

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:40.888
and you say something important 
has come up?

01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:44.433
<i>- When are you coming home?</i>
- I don't know.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.145
Don't tell me you don't know.

01:32:48.355 --> 01:32:51.732
I want to know when the hell
you're coming home, now!

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.318
Amanda, shut up!

01:32:54.653 --> 01:32:56.320
<i>Did you hear me?
Shut up!</i>

01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:01.617
I'll get home when I'm finished,
not a second before. Is that clear?

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.827
Is that clear?

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:08.749
You don't have to bite my head off.

01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:14.171
And you have dinner ready
and waiting for me, okay?

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:18.842
And leave the skin on the chicken.
All right?

01:33:22.055 --> 01:33:23.097
Goodbye.

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:29.395
Shit!

01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:31.188
Let's go!

01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:33.732
Surprise!

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:38.779
I'm sorry, Prendergast!

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:44.159
We tried and tried, but could not fit 
your fucking name on the cake!

01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:48.872
Congratulations.
You made it out alive!

01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:52.876
- Listen, listen.
- All right, hold it, hold it.

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:56.505
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've been waiting for.

01:33:56.756 --> 01:34:01.093
This afternoon's entertainment,
Miss Suzie!

01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:10.019
Suzie Q!

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:12.563
Do your thing!

01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:15.733
Is this the retiring boy?

01:34:16.026 --> 01:34:17.985
Wait, wait!
This is great, guys.

01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:22.990
This is great.
I appreciate it, but I can't stay.

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:26.827
Jesus! What's your problem?
You afraid of women too?

01:34:27.037 --> 01:34:29.663
I don't blame him.
You ever met his wife?

01:34:31.041 --> 01:34:32.041
What did you say?

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:33.834
- What?
- What did you say?

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:37.588
- Nothing.
- We don't have time for this.

01:34:39.299 --> 01:34:40.716
You're right.

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:47.723
<i>Ready, honey?</i>

01:34:52.479 --> 01:34:56.440
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:34:57.275 --> 01:34:59.068
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:01.362
<i>to you</i>

01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:03.822
<i>No cake for you?</i>

01:35:04.074 --> 01:35:06.367
<i>If she doesn't want it,
don't force her.</i>

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:08.452
<i>Okay, you can have the teddy.</i>

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:10.454
<i>Time to go horsy!</i>

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:14.291
<i>Oh, It's okay. Horsy!
It's okay.</i>

01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:17.628
<i>Giddyap, giddyap.</i>

01:35:22.592 --> 01:35:25.969
<i>- She doesn't want to.
- Just put her on the horse!</i>

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:28.972
<i>There we go! Horsy ride.</i>

01:35:30.266 --> 01:35:31.350
<i>She doesn't want to.</i>

01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:35.104
<i>- Put her on the horse!
- You can't force her like that.</i>

01:35:35.355 --> 01:35:37.689
<i>I bought her the goddamn horse.</i>

01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:40.150
<i>Here we go! Horsy ride.</i>

01:35:40.402 --> 01:35:43.487
<i>You're scaring her.
I want you to stop this.</i>

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:50.494
<i>Come on, honey.
It's your birthday. It's the pier.</i>

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:54.123
<i>It's your favorite place.
You love the pier.</i>

01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:58.710
<i>Why do you do this?</i>

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:27.406
Take the back.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.440
You okay?

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:04.193
- I'm all right.
- Somebody get an ambulance.

01:37:04.611 --> 01:37:08.071
Get an ambulance! Call 911!
Get an ambulance!

01:37:08.364 --> 01:37:12.868
Tell them an officer's been shot!
Go, go, go! Get an ambulance!

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:16.288
Be careful.

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:19.917
Go get the bastard!

01:37:20.251 --> 01:37:22.085
He's still dressed like G.I. Joe!

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:18.725
Daddy! Mommy, look.
Daddy!

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:40.247
Hi, honey.
I thought I'd find you here.

01:38:42.792 --> 01:38:44.001
Leave us alone!

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:47.671
What? I can't talk to my wife?

01:38:48.381 --> 01:38:49.756
I'm not your wife anymore.

01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:54.219
No? Sugar, does this ring a bell?
"Till death do us part"?

01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:56.471
Do you remember that?

01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:04.271
I'm sorry.

01:39:04.689 --> 01:39:06.189
Sorry, sorry.

01:39:06.441 --> 01:39:07.441
What are you doing?

01:39:07.692 --> 01:39:10.319
I'm coming home 
from a hard day at the office.

01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:12.988
God bless the working stiffs!

01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:22.331
Please leave her alone!

01:39:29.339 --> 01:39:30.339
Adele?

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:34.885
You're so big!

01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:38.221
How'd you get so big?

01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:42.851
I missed it.

01:39:43.853 --> 01:39:45.937
They stole it from me, honey.

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:49.733
Don't you worry. 
They're not gonna take it anymore.

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:56.823
Bill, listen, please.

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:01.578
You've got to stop this.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:07.000
You need help.

01:40:08.628 --> 01:40:09.753
You're sick.

01:40:10.588 --> 01:40:11.630
Sick?

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:14.383
You wanna see sick?

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:16.885
Take a walk around this town.
That's sick.

01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:18.303
You ain't kidding.

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:25.143
Would you believe it
that I used to fish right here?

01:40:27.814 --> 01:40:29.773
This very spot?

01:40:30.274 --> 01:40:33.068
Now they tell you,
"Don't eat the fish. It's poisonous."

01:40:34.612 --> 01:40:36.905
You can't even swim in the water.

01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:40.158
It'll give you some kind 
of bacterial infection.

01:40:41.703 --> 01:40:43.495
How's that for sick?

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.998
I'm having a private moment with my family. 
Leave us alone.

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.334
I'm leaving soon.

01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:53.171
I'm retiring to Arizona.
Lake Havasu City.

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:54.923
You been there?

01:40:55.174 --> 01:40:56.842
That's not what I mean!

01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:02.848
They call it a lake, but it's really
just a big bowl of muddy water.

01:41:03.057 --> 01:41:05.600
But the wife thinks it's paradise.

01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:09.354
Everybody has their own idea
of what paradise is.

01:41:12.817 --> 01:41:13.900
Take me, for instance.

01:41:16.612 --> 01:41:18.739
You know what I thought paradise was?

01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:21.450
- What?
- If you'll excuse me.

01:41:22.994 --> 01:41:24.202
Making babies.

01:41:25.246 --> 01:41:28.331
Ain't that a kick?
Making babies.

01:41:29.751 --> 01:41:31.460
This your little girl?

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:33.754
Beautiful.

01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:36.923
She's special.

01:41:41.721 --> 01:41:44.848
You know, my wife never was
cut out for motherhood.

01:41:45.475 --> 01:41:46.558
She did it all for me.

01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:49.603
Went through all that pain,
lost her figure, for me.

01:41:50.688 --> 01:41:53.565
Then the kid went to sleep one night, 
never woke up.

01:41:54.776 --> 01:41:57.110
They called it "Infant Death...

01:41:58.446 --> 01:42:00.030
Syndrome."

01:42:01.157 --> 01:42:03.867
But she wasn't an infant.
She was 2 years old.

01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:05.869
She was a big girl.

01:42:07.538 --> 01:42:09.206
She was our baby.

01:42:12.293 --> 01:42:15.170
Here, darling, this is for you.
Here you go.

01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:23.595
What can you do?

01:42:24.889 --> 01:42:27.766
If she'd been hit by a drunk driver....

01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:30.685
But who do you blame
when they just don't wake up?

01:42:31.395 --> 01:42:32.395
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:38.068
There's a guy with a gun!

01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:44.032
No! Don't!

01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:46.910
Elizabeth, no!

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:50.288
Freeze!
You're under arrest.

01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:51.540
Get out of here!

01:42:51.749 --> 01:42:54.042
- Elizabeth! 
- Freeze!

01:42:57.338 --> 01:42:59.714
- What were you gonna do?
- I don't know!

01:42:59.924 --> 01:43:02.092
Guys like you always say that!

01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:06.721
You know exactly what you were gonna do. 
Kill your wife and child!

01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:12.727
Then it'd be too late to turn back.
It'd be easy to kill yourself.

01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:16.815
Let's go meet some nice policemen.
They're good guys. Let's go.

01:43:18.234 --> 01:43:20.569
- I'm the bad guy?
- Yeah.

01:43:25.575 --> 01:43:27.617
How did that happen?

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:31.580
I did everything they told me to.

01:43:34.792 --> 01:43:36.293
Did you know I build missiles?

01:43:37.211 --> 01:43:39.087
I help to protect America.

01:43:42.592 --> 01:43:44.467
You should be rewarded for that.

01:43:44.677 --> 01:43:48.305
Instead, they give it to the plastic surgeon. 
They lied to me.

01:43:50.641 --> 01:43:54.519
Is that what this is about?
You're angry because you got lied to?

01:43:55.021 --> 01:43:57.314
Is that why my dinner's drying out 
in the oven?

01:43:58.107 --> 01:44:01.234
They lie to everybody.
They lie to the fish!

01:44:02.695 --> 01:44:05.614
That doesn't give you any right
to do what you did today.

01:44:06.282 --> 01:44:11.161
The only thing that makes you special
is that little girl. Now, let's go.

01:44:12.288 --> 01:44:13.705
Let's go!

01:44:21.047 --> 01:44:22.672
Sure was hot today, wasn't it?

01:44:25.635 --> 01:44:27.510
He has a gun!
The end of the pier!

01:44:27.678 --> 01:44:30.639
Keep this crowd back!
Let's get some backup!

01:44:35.519 --> 01:44:36.895
You know, I got a gun.

01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:44.527
In my pocket.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.325
I got lots of guns.

01:44:50.576 --> 01:44:52.911
Stay there. Don't move.

01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:54.412
You wanna draw?

01:44:55.081 --> 01:44:57.791
Let's not.
Let's call it a day.

01:44:58.042 --> 01:44:59.793
Now, come on.

01:45:00.044 --> 01:45:01.878
It's perfect.

01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:05.924
Showdown between the sheriff
and the bad guy?

01:45:08.052 --> 01:45:09.219
It's beautiful.

01:45:14.266 --> 01:45:15.392
On three.

01:45:15.643 --> 01:45:19.062
This doesn't have to be the end.
You have a choice.

01:45:19.271 --> 01:45:22.607
My little girl is dead.
I don't have a choice. You do!

01:45:23.234 --> 01:45:25.485
No, you have two choices:

01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:27.112
I can kill you.

01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:30.240
Or you can kill me...

01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:33.368
and my little girl
can get the insurance.

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:39.207
- One....
- Don't you wanna see her grow up?

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:41.710
Behind bars?

01:45:44.964 --> 01:45:47.590
- Two....
- Don't do this. Please.

01:45:49.301 --> 01:45:50.593
- Let's go!
- Three.

01:45:59.729 --> 01:46:01.938
I would have got you.

01:46:41.353 --> 01:46:45.523
What cooperation was there
between Pacific Division and Downtown?

01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:47.859
Not to denigrate the Venice Police...

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:51.654
but it was one of our fellows
that put this together.

01:46:51.864 --> 01:46:53.281
Prendergast!

01:46:53.949 --> 01:46:57.660
This is Sergeant Prendergast.
Damn fine work, Prendergast.

01:46:57.912 --> 01:47:00.789
Fuck you, Captain Yardley.
Fuck you very much!

01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:03.166
I can't believe--
Did he just say that?

01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:04.751
You're welcome.

01:47:08.964 --> 01:47:11.049
- You still here?
- Afraid so.

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:14.469
We've stabilized her.
She'll be all right.

01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:16.805
I'll see you at the hospital.

01:47:20.184 --> 01:47:21.810
How are you doing?

01:47:25.231 --> 01:47:26.481
I haven't told her yet.

01:47:28.067 --> 01:47:29.734
Oh, shit!

01:47:30.945 --> 01:47:33.613
It's her birthday.
What should I do?

01:47:34.824 --> 01:47:36.616
Tell her tomorrow.

01:47:37.118 --> 01:47:38.743
Let her have her little party.

01:47:46.418 --> 01:47:48.920
- What's your name, darling?
- Adele.

01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:51.840
Adele?
That's a nice name.

01:47:52.466 --> 01:47:55.552
If I had a little girl,
I'd want her to be named Adele.

01:47:55.761 --> 01:47:58.513
- What's yours?
- Mine?

01:48:00.391 --> 01:48:02.267
My name is mud.

01:48:04.562 --> 01:48:06.229
Your name is not mud.

01:48:06.397 --> 01:48:09.357
It will be when my wife
finds out that...

01:48:09.567 --> 01:48:11.442
I'm still a cop.

01:48:16.657 --> 01:48:17.907
Excuse me.

01:48:22.037 --> 01:48:23.955
Sergeant just signed us out.

01:48:24.165 --> 01:48:26.833
- All right, let's eat.
- Where you wanna go?

01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:30.461
Let's go around the corner
and get one of those....

01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:38.761
<i>Look what I got!</i>

01:48:42.266 --> 01:48:44.559
<i>Just call him, 
"Hi, Puppy."</i>

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.561
<i>Hi, Puppy.</i>

01:48:47.897 --> 01:48:49.439
<i>Hi, Puppy.</i>

01:48:54.612 --> 01:48:57.780
<i>There we are!
We got everybody there.</i>

01:48:58.574 --> 01:49:00.450
<i>We got everybody--</i>

01:49:01.305 --> 01:49:07.227
