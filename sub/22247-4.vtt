[Shiro]
<span style="style.default_1">Good news.</span>

01:05.565 --> 01:06.900
There's been an upsurge in planets

01:06.983 --> 01:08.485
 that have been liberated
from Galra control

01:08.568 --> 01:10.737
by the Blade of Marmora
and the rebel forces.

01:10.820 --> 01:14.115
Convincing these planets
to join our coalition is priority one.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.410
-Oh, does that mean more Voltron events?
-Yes.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.162
Believe it or not,
the Voltron show-of-arms

01:19.245 --> 01:21.790
goes a long way
in inspiring others to join the fight.

01:22.457 --> 01:26.294
The green clusters you see here,
here, and here, represent planets

01:26.377 --> 01:29.506
and, in some cases, entire star systems
that have joined the coalition.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.760
Not coincidentally, those are also
the areas we've personally visited.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.095
All right! Razzle-dazzle time!

01:36.971 --> 01:38.515
For the war effort, of course.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.852
-Coran, can you set everything up?
-I know just where to start.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.862
[Shiro]
<span style="style.default_1">All right, the last column's in place.</span>

01:52.946 --> 01:55.365
<span style="style.default_1">Now, this hospital can service</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the entire sector.</span>

01:55.865 --> 01:58.868
But that's only the first step
in helping these injured war veterans.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.787
Come on in, it's time.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.997
[monitor beeping]

02:04.290 --> 02:07.544
Everyone check your wrist devices.
I uploaded a script onto them.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.882
-What is this?
-Yeah, there's barely anybody out there.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.802
I scaled down the show
so we can do it indoors for the patients,

02:15.885 --> 02:17.554
you know, to lift their spirits.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.014
 This isn't even factually accurate.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.602
Well, this is the Legend of Voltron,
not the documentary of Voltron.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.604
Speaking of which,
Allura, you'll be playing Keith.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.730
[groans]

02:27.814 --> 02:30.483
The word of Keith leaving the team
hasn't really spread yet,

02:30.567 --> 02:32.443
so I didn't want to confuse anyone.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.405
Besides, playing Keith is easy.
Just act really moody.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.447
[growls]

02:36.531 --> 02:39.075
There! You've done it!
Come on, everyone in positions.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
Just follow the script.

02:43.121 --> 02:47.959
Ladies and gentle-aliens,
bear witness as the Paladins of Voltron

02:48.042 --> 02:52.422
attack Zarkon's base
to save the helpless Princess Allura!

02:52.505 --> 02:54.716
-[fanfare playing]
-[high-pitched electronic screeching]

02:55.717 --> 02:57.302
[indistinct chatter]

02:57.385 --> 02:58.803
[Coran]
Shiro, you're on!

03:00.805 --> 03:01.723
Uh...

03:01.806 --> 03:03.433
"I will save the princess,

03:03.516 --> 03:08.396
even if it means taking on
the Galra Empire with my bare hand."

03:08.479 --> 03:12.567
"And you won't have to do it alone
because you'll have me, Hunk."

03:12.650 --> 03:14.652
"And me, Pidge."

03:14.736 --> 03:16.195
And me, Lance!

03:16.988 --> 03:18.740
"Holds bayard dashingly."

03:18.823 --> 03:19.782
Oh.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.953
"And me... Keith."

03:24.787 --> 03:29.042
"Thank you, team, for always being
by my side, through thick or thin."

03:29.125 --> 03:30.543
[beeping]

03:30.627 --> 03:33.046
"Now, come along. Together, we'll..."

03:33.129 --> 03:35.840
[all]
...defeat Zarkon!

03:37.091 --> 03:38.927
[in high voice]
My heroes!

03:41.721 --> 03:43.223
[crickets chirping]

03:43.306 --> 03:44.474
[Hunk]
Well, that bombed.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.643
Yeah, speaking of bombs,

03:46.726 --> 03:51.064
we need to get back to doing air shows
with explosions and lasers... and bombs!

03:51.147 --> 03:54.484
[sighs]
I was hoping to expand our horizons.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.740
Hey, there, friend.
You look like you could use a little help.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.954
I know you.
You ran the Unilu swap shop in the mall.

04:06.037 --> 04:09.207
I saw that space wreck
of a show you put on.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.792
I don't know what I was thinking.

04:10.875 --> 04:16.547
Then stop thinking and be concious-neezy!
Concious-neezy mind enhancers!

04:16.630 --> 04:19.091
Pop one of these babies
under your pillow at night,

04:19.175 --> 04:20.551
and when you wake up in the morning,

04:20.635 --> 04:23.680
your brain will be filled
with brilliant thoughts and ideas.

04:23.763 --> 04:29.102
They seep while you sleep!
The price is 12,000 GAC.

04:30.186 --> 04:34.440
-Would you take a used left shoe?
-I'll accept the yellow Voltron bayard.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.025
How about 14 nose hairs?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.653
I'll take your left arm, plated in luxite.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.697
A firm handshake
and a pat on the back, then?

04:40.780 --> 04:43.908
I get to ride on your shoulders
for one deca-phoeb.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.661
Well, how about I give you 600 GAC
and don't tell the staff

04:46.744 --> 04:49.539
you're running an unlicensed swap shop
in an intergalactic hospital?

04:49.622 --> 04:50.790
Deal!

04:52.750 --> 04:54.043
Coran, you comin'?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.879
[moaning in high voice]

04:59.465 --> 05:01.634
[Coran]
<span style="style.default_1">Voltron air show, here we come!</span>

05:03.761 --> 05:05.722
[Lance] <span style="style.default_1">I hope you booked</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a larger venue this time.</span>

05:08.433 --> 05:11.602
I'm not sure if these are
the best conditions for a show.

05:11.686 --> 05:16.566
<span style="style.default_1">Well, if it isn't Team Voltron,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a day late and a fertronium short.</span>

05:17.400 --> 05:19.235
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.446
<span style="style.default_1">Is there a problem? Yes!</span>

05:21.529 --> 05:25.867
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, there is a problem!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You were supposed to be here yesterday!</span>

05:25.950 --> 05:29.829
<span style="style.default_1">It was the one day out of the year</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we have clear skies.</span>

05:29.912 --> 05:33.541
<span style="style.default_1">The other 720 days are like this!</span>

05:33.624 --> 05:35.293
Oh, I see my mistake.

05:35.376 --> 05:38.796
-I forgot to calculate for time dilation.
<span style="style.default_1">-Oh, you made a mistake?</span>

05:38.880 --> 05:43.885
<span style="style.default_1">The entire planet was out of their burrows</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for Clear-Day, just waiting.</span>

05:43.968 --> 05:46.137
<span style="style.default_1">"Where's Voltron?" they kept asking.</span>

05:46.220 --> 05:47.764
Okay, th-that's on me.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.434
<span style="style.default_1">I said, "Don't worry, they'll show up,"</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but did you? No!</span>

05:51.517 --> 05:55.605
<span style="style.default_1">Then, everyone starts turning on me.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"You said they'd be here!"</span>

05:56.355 --> 05:58.357
-[rumbling]
-[all grunting]

05:58.441 --> 05:59.484
What was that?

06:02.695 --> 06:03.905
[rumbling]

06:03.988 --> 06:06.365
<span style="style.default_1">It's a Swathian meerakeet.</span>

06:06.449 --> 06:11.120
<span style="style.default_1">They show up every day of the year</span>
<span style="style.default_1">except one. Guess which day?</span>

06:11.204 --> 06:12.872
-Okay, we get it.
<span style="style.default_1">-Clear-Day!</span>

06:12.955 --> 06:14.290
Ugh.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.959
Don't worry.
They'll chase any beam of light.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.045
<span style="style.default_1">I'll lead him away</span>
<span style="style.default_1">while we get out of here.</span>

06:32.100 --> 06:34.143
[Coran sighs]
<span style="style.default_1">I'm really sorry about that.</span>

06:34.227 --> 06:36.270
Coran, if we're going
to expand this coalition

06:36.354 --> 06:37.814
in the short amount of time that we have,

06:37.897 --> 06:39.899
 we can't afford these kind of mistakes.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.901
That last show was pretty lame.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.237
I don't know if you're cut out
to be managing this whole thing.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.907
Just give me one more chance.
I promise to turn it around.

07:02.797 --> 07:06.300
[creature squeaking]

07:07.468 --> 07:09.929
[squeaking continues]

07:12.056 --> 07:12.932
[squeaking]

07:13.015 --> 07:13.850
[squeaks loudly]

07:23.651 --> 07:26.112
It's official. We've reached rock-bottom.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.991
[Shiro] Yeah, I don't know
if this is the best place

07:30.074 --> 07:32.493
to get our message out
to the widest audience.

07:32.577 --> 07:37.582
Shiro, baby, you're right.
And I want what you want, man.

07:37.665 --> 07:43.004
But I've had some epiphanies,
some ideas, some realizations.

07:43.087 --> 07:47.091
What we have to do is broadcast a show
across an entire galaxy.

07:47.175 --> 07:51.846
We could reach the largest viewership
in the history of intergalactic showbiz.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.431
Aw, yeah!

07:53.514 --> 07:57.810
But we need to workshop some things
before we can take it to the next level.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.437
You with me, kid?

08:00.396 --> 08:04.358
-You seem different.
-[chuckles] You mean "better."

08:04.442 --> 08:08.529
Look, it's my mission to make sure
our message really sings.

08:08.613 --> 08:12.783
Beautiful aliens from here to Vlexlar
will know your name.

08:12.867 --> 08:16.496
And your coalition will put
the Galra's army to shame.

08:17.622 --> 08:22.126
-Well, it rhymes, so it's gotta be true.
-[sighs] I guess we'll give it a try.

08:26.714 --> 08:31.552
Okay, we have got the air show down,
which is great!

08:31.636 --> 08:35.431
But we need to add
a theatrical element to expand.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.308
The hospital performance was a disaster,

08:38.392 --> 08:41.604
but I think it can work
if you follow my guidelines, guys.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.983
Rule number one,
never walk onto stage, all right?

08:46.067 --> 08:50.613
You gotta leap onto stage,
roll onto stage.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.950
I'm talkin' explode onto stage!

08:54.033 --> 08:55.743
Yeah!

08:55.826 --> 08:58.538
[wheels squeaking]

08:58.621 --> 09:04.293

09:19.684 --> 09:24.105
Number two, don't just say your line.
You gotta shout that line.

09:24.188 --> 09:27.191
Remember, louder is better!

09:27.275 --> 09:28.109
[rock music playing]

09:28.192 --> 09:30.945
-Keith, I need your help!
-I'm on it!

Look out! He's firing his lasers!

[siren wailing]

09:35.783 --> 09:37.326

09:37.410 --> 09:40.871
And, finally, strike a pose
after every movement.

Everyone loves a pose.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.053
 The Voltron Coalition needs you!

09:56.137 --> 09:59.307
I would like to join
the Voltron Coalition!

09:59.390 --> 10:01.642
[cheers, applause]

10:03.227 --> 10:05.521
-At least, the crowd stayed until the end.
-Mm-hmm.

10:05.605 --> 10:10.484
-That... actually went really well.
-Yeah, you're trending galaxy-wide!

10:10.568 --> 10:12.570
I mean, you're a four-quadrant hit!

10:12.653 --> 10:15.740
Your plus sevens are plus ten!
But that's just the beginning!

this universe has ever seen!

11:14.173 --> 11:18.052
Sire, soon, you will defeat the paladins,

11:18.135 --> 11:20.679
and Voltron will be yours.

We need teamwork!

is with Voltron!

[party horns blowing]

12:30.040 --> 12:33.669
I'll get you next time!

12:35.212 --> 12:37.131
[all cheering]

12:41.719 --> 12:44.680
How many of these appearances
do we have to put on?

12:44.763 --> 12:48.559
I know they seem humiliating,
but Coran's ideas are working.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.811
Every performance draws
more people to the cause.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.522
-Exactly. All that stuff.
-[all chattering indistinctly]

12:53.606 --> 12:56.859
Okay, all right, let's go, come on!
We've got business to discuss!

12:57.860 --> 12:59.528
First of all, great job.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.155
Tonight was a big success.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.908
Now, we're back on track,
better than ever!

13:03.991 --> 13:05.910
There's no doubt about it, you're stars.

13:05.993 --> 13:09.788
But, to go supernova,
you gotta push it even further.

13:09.872 --> 13:14.168
-A supernova is an exploding star.
-And what's brighter than that?

13:14.251 --> 13:18.255
Here's the deal. I've worked up
very specific personas for each of you.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.965
This is gonna help the audience connect

13:20.049 --> 13:22.968
on a much deeper level
with each team member.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.430
-There's Loverboy Lance.
-Loverboy Lance?

13:26.514 --> 13:29.934
-It's perfect because it's true.
-You're Science-Wiz Pidge.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.769
Whoa! Look out, big brain!

13:31.852 --> 13:35.564
We've got Lone Wolf Keith.
That's you 'cause you're Keith.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.150
And I'm thinking your catchphrase
could be like a howl.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.652
[growls]

13:39.735 --> 13:42.363
Well, that's more of a growl,
but you'll keep working on it.

13:42.446 --> 13:45.241
Hunk, from now on,
you'll be Humorous Hunk.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.742
And last but not least...

13:46.825 --> 13:49.328
Shiro, the Hero!

13:54.333 --> 13:56.752
[rock music playing]

14:02.925 --> 14:06.095
Remember, you're Humorous Hunk,
so be funny.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.096
 Yeah, okay.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.181
How do I do that?

14:09.265 --> 14:11.976
Don't worry, all right?
I got you covered.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.437
Bii-Boh-Bi, engage Humorous Hunk.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.983
-[Bii-Boh-Bi] <span style="style.default_1">Bi-boh!</span>

[loud farting]

14:25.072 --> 14:27.825
That-- That wasn't me. That--
I don't know who that was.

-[all laughing]

14:31.120 --> 14:32.955
[rock music playing]

14:36.584 --> 14:38.544
[Coran]
Look how popular we've become!

14:38.627 --> 14:39.879
[audience applauding]

14:39.962 --> 14:40.796
[Shiro]
Coran!

14:41.714 --> 14:44.258
I think it would go a long way
if I can deliver a speech

14:44.341 --> 14:47.177
about how we're trying to unite a front
and build a coalition.

14:47.261 --> 14:50.055
What? Stop talkin'!
You're Shiro, the Hero.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.850
Heroes don't speak. You're silent ninja.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.477
-Wh-- But--
-Shh! Zip it.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.148
Muscles speak louder than words. Right?
It's always been my motto.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.734
Now, put on this super tight shirt
and get out there!

15:01.817 --> 15:04.528
-[audience cheering]
-[rock music playing]

15:08.699 --> 15:11.827
Hey, Coran, I'm having real issues
with the science you put in the script.

15:11.911 --> 15:15.164
-It doesn't make sense.
-Oh, it doesn't need to.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.375
But I hate saying
all these made-up scientific words.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.544
Isn't the audience gonna be confused?

15:20.628 --> 15:24.548
Oh, they'd be confused
if you used the real words, too!

15:24.632 --> 15:26.842
[rock music playing]

15:28.636 --> 15:30.679
What just happened?

15:31.221 --> 15:34.767
"I just re-configured
the flytzal mac protocol

15:34.850 --> 15:37.603
to reverse-quadrant
the spectrum harfinger."

15:37.686 --> 15:41.190
Mm-hmm. I guess Pidge just defeated
the Galra with science!

15:41.273 --> 15:42.274

-[groans]

15:42.358 --> 15:45.319

15:54.536 --> 15:58.165
[Coran growls]
<span style="style.default_1">You're great, Loverboy Lance!</span>

15:58.248 --> 16:00.584
[chuckles]
Thanks, Red.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.465
Guys, the recruitment rallies are amazing.
Look at all the green on this map!

16:06.548 --> 16:08.926
We certainly had our doubts at first,

16:09.009 --> 16:12.763
but I have to admit, Coran,
your plan is actually working.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.432
Why, thank you, Keith!
I like to keep you in character.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.018
And it's only gonna get better
with a few improvements.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.522
-More improvements?
-Please, no more farts.

16:21.605 --> 16:25.901
Hear me out.
First, it's time Voltron starts to talk.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.404
Everyone's dying to hear
what the big guy sounds like.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.533
Next, we'll introduce new weapons
and new outfits for each of you.

16:32.616 --> 16:36.036
Coran, what are you talking about?
We only have one more show.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.163
After the big intergalactic broadcast,
we're done.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.748
What are <span style="style.default_1">you</span> talking about?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.835
We're just getting started here!
We can't stop now!

16:45.713 --> 16:46.672
[breathing heavily]

16:46.755 --> 16:50.718
-Uh, Coran, you feelin' okay?
-Yeah, you seem extra twitchy.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.887
You must realize that we need
to get back to fighting Zarkon.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.639
We <span style="style.default_1">are</span> fighting Zarkon!

16:55.723 --> 16:58.517
Six nights a week
and twice on the astral conflux!

16:58.600 --> 17:00.686
<span style="style.default_1">Bi-bi-boh bi-bi-bi-bi-oh</span>
<span style="style.default_1">bi-bi-bi-boh-bi-bi.</span>

17:00.769 --> 17:02.980
I don't care
if the new laser show is here!

17:03.063 --> 17:05.733
What have I told you about walkin' in
when I'm talking to the talent?

17:05.816 --> 17:06.650
<span style="style.default_1">Boh...</span>

17:06.733 --> 17:10.529
Coran, we have to do our next event,
but, after that, no more shows.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.742
You're a bunch of quitters! Quitters!

17:14.825 --> 17:17.536
I'm a visionary! I have thoughts, ideas!

17:17.618 --> 17:19.621
I don't need you anyway!
I'll rewrite the show!

17:19.704 --> 17:22.540
Get rid of the whole lot of ya!
Replace you with new paladins!

17:22.624 --> 17:24.917
And the show will be better
than ever before!

17:27.212 --> 17:29.506
Except for you, Shiro.
I'll never get rid of you.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.883
You're our most popular character.

17:30.966 --> 17:34.303
But the rest of you will never work
in show business again!

17:35.763 --> 17:37.014
Wait...

17:37.097 --> 17:38.807
<span style="style.default_1">You're</span> the most popular character?

-[rock music playing]
-[audience cheering]

17:42.603 --> 17:45.814
All right, remember, guys,
this is being broadcast galaxy-wide.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.608
It's the final piece in our plan.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.778
So, let's make our last appearance
our best appearance.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.572
-I'm concerned about Coran.
-[scoffs]

17:53.655 --> 17:56.325
He was getting crazy.
He'll realize that soon enough.

<span style="style.default_1">Bi-boh bi-boh-bi.</span>

17:58.535 --> 18:01.205
I have no idea what Bii-Boh-Bi is saying.

18:03.499 --> 18:07.628
[grunts] They think they can stop
this dream machine? Not on my watch.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.296
This show's going on forever and ever.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.632
It's done when I say it's done,
and it's not done.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.801
I'm saying it's not done,
and we're doing it now!

18:24.520 --> 18:26.480
[roars]

18:26.563 --> 18:30.150
This next performance
is gonna be longer, better, bigger!

18:30.234 --> 18:31.944
You're about to steal the show!

[loud rumbling]

18:56.009 --> 18:57.594
Did you hear that rumbling?

18:57.678 --> 18:59.221
According to my thermal calculations,

18:59.304 --> 19:02.099
there's only one thing
that can cause a sound like that.

19:02.182 --> 19:05.310
-A Galra robeast!
-[audience jeering]

19:05.394 --> 19:08.856
Zarkon has sent a robeast
to try and destroy us and the planet!

19:08.939 --> 19:11.650
We'll show him
who's going to destroy whom!

19:11.733 --> 19:15.028
Everyone, we need to form Voltron!

Paladins, that monster
you're fighting onstage is real!

I've got an idea. We can use
the lights from the hover screen

21:58.942 --> 22:01.236
to lure the monster away from the crowd.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.321
I've got this.

<span style="style.default_1">I'm so sorry, guys.</span>

 I shouldn't have trusted

Looking back, it seems
like such an obviously bad decision.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.683
Yeah. Worm pills? Gross!

I didn't mean to take us
this far off mission.
