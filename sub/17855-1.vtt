a great night.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.446
We have an amazing show
today.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.082
We have Kelly Ripa...

00:14.115 --> 00:15.549
- Eeee!
- Keep it in your pants.

00:15.583 --> 00:19.120
- We have Sarah Jessica Parker
and Andy Cohen.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.389
- Staci!
- Wow!

00:21.422 --> 00:22.723
- Impressive!
- Very well done.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.093
- I know!
- This is what it must be like

00:25.126 --> 00:26.827
to work on "Seth Meyers."
- Or "Jimmy Fallon."

00:26.860 --> 00:28.362
On a bad night.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.598
- I went to a taping
of "Colbert" last week,

00:30.631 --> 00:32.700
and it was just A-list star
after A-list star

00:32.733 --> 00:34.435
after A-list star.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.770
And it didn't even seem like
it was a big night for them.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.806
It was like just normal
Wednesday.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.841
- Okay, all right.
- How do those other

00:40.874 --> 00:42.543
talent bookers do it?
- If you're good at your job,

00:42.576 --> 00:43.744
you can book stars
like that anytime--

00:43.777 --> 00:45.679
- Listen to me.
I am good at my job.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.548
I do excel at my job.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.283
It's just that everybody
hates Jimmy!

00:49.317 --> 00:51.285
[shrieking]
Jimmy's a bad person!

00:51.319 --> 00:52.720
- Free gifts from Jimmy!

00:52.753 --> 00:54.088
[overlapping exclamations]

00:54.122 --> 00:55.623
Yeah, he wanted
to thank everyone

00:55.656 --> 00:58.559
for that .002 ratings jump,
so...

00:58.592 --> 01:00.194
nice!
[laughs]

01:00.228 --> 01:01.462
Here ya go.
- Oh!

01:01.495 --> 01:02.696

01:02.730 --> 01:04.098
- Thanks, Todd.

01:04.132 --> 01:06.167

- Thank you so much, Todd.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.702
- Here ya go.
Grady!

01:08.736 --> 01:11.305
- All right.
- And Marcus.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.707
- Wait a second!
This is a Tag Heuer?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.409
That's a really
expensive watch.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.478
- Yeah, but Jimmy's
the face of the brand,

01:17.511 --> 01:19.580
so obviously,
he gets a discount.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.615
- Everyone get their watches?

01:21.649 --> 01:22.816
all: Yeah.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.518
- No one...doubled up?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.254
all: Nope.
- Something wrong, man?

01:26.287 --> 01:27.321
- I didn't get one.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.656
- It's probably upstairs, Todd.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.291
- I'm sure it's upstairs.
- Yeah.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.160
- Well, Jimmy said
he put 'em all in the bag.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.728
- Oh, I'm sure he left
yours upstairs.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.764
- Yeah?
- Yeah! You got one!

01:36.797 --> 01:38.532
- Me.
- Todd's got one!

01:38.566 --> 01:40.168
- Todd. I'm Todd.
- Who's a good boy?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.735
- Me. Todd! Me!
- Who's a good boy?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.137
- Me!
- Go get it!

01:43.171 --> 01:44.538
Go get it, go get it!
- Me!

01:44.572 --> 01:47.508
[laughing]

01:50.311 --> 01:53.447
[laughing]

01:53.481 --> 01:55.149
- I hope he's from
a shelter,

01:55.183 --> 01:56.817
not a breeder.

A man with more housewives

Andy Cohen.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.739
And now, number five
in the ratings,

02:18.772 --> 02:20.741
but number one in our hearts,

02:20.774 --> 02:23.377
here's Jimmy!

Penny.

please stop leaving

02:30.651 --> 02:33.521
naked photos of yourself
in my mailbox."

02:33.554 --> 02:35.356
- XOXO, Staci.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.590
[door slides open]

02:40.394 --> 02:42.296
Todd, you seem upset.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.865
- I'm the only one that didn't
get a watch from Jimmy.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.567
- I'm sure he just forgot.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.236
- Does this mean
I'm out of his entourage?

02:48.269 --> 02:51.572
It has to, right?
- No! I'm sure he just...

02:51.605 --> 02:52.973
overlooked.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.343
- Yeah. I mean,
you guys grew up together.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.412
You're best friends.
He would never forget you, Todd.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.514
- That's what I thought.
I don't even know what to do.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.850
I can't get another job.
I don't have a resume.

03:02.883 --> 03:03.951
- A résumé?

03:03.984 --> 03:06.420
- I don't speak Spanish.
What?

03:06.454 --> 03:07.888
- Look, I'm sure
he just forgot.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.258
- No! He wrote a list
of people

03:10.291 --> 03:12.260
he wanted to get presents for.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.894
With a pen!

03:13.927 --> 03:16.397
He never uses pens!

03:16.430 --> 03:19.533
He used a pen
one time in his life,

03:19.567 --> 03:22.403
to take his dad off of
life support--that's it.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.606
I'm gonna go find Randy
help me with my resume.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.343
[energetic brass music]

03:29.377 --> 03:32.446
- Then I spent a few years
as a hedge funder,

03:32.480 --> 03:35.816
which was profitable,
but very stressful.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.352
Yeah, so now I'm working

03:38.386 --> 03:40.588
in the low-stress job
of security.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.922
- That's happy.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.458
- You look so familiar
to me.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.527
Something about New York.
- Mm-hmm.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.961
- Did you run for mayor?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.397
- No.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.464
- Sarah Jessica Parker.

Hi!
- Nice to see you.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.338
- All right, I'm handing
her over to you now.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.708
If anything terrible happens,
the blood is on your hands.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.810
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna go get a soda.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.546
- Oh, anyway, this was dropped
off for you earlier.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.381
- Oh, good, thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:07.415 --> 04:10.418
- Did I just, um...
did I just see you recently

04:10.451 --> 04:12.019
at a...

04:12.052 --> 04:13.587
Was it at the--
was it the Met Gala?

04:13.621 --> 04:15.289
- No, no, I've never been
to the Met.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.857
I don't have...
Nobody...

04:16.890 --> 04:18.726
Didn't get an invite!
- Oh.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.061
I-I just...I feel like
I know you

04:21.094 --> 04:22.830
from something else, then?

04:22.863 --> 04:26.434
- You went to the Poughkeepsie
All Girls Theater Camp.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.868
- Oh, my God! Yeah!

04:27.901 --> 04:29.670
When I was...
when I was 14.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.904
- 14. Yeah, yeah.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.373
We were in the same bunk
together--

04:32.406 --> 04:33.707
the Greta Garbo bunk.
- No!

04:33.741 --> 04:35.676
- I'm Staci,
but you called me "Jaws"

04:35.709 --> 04:37.711
'cause I had braces
and headgear.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.913
- Jaws!
Oh, my God, yeah!

04:39.947 --> 04:41.415
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God--wait!

04:41.449 --> 04:43.016
We did "Peter Pan" together,
right?

04:43.050 --> 04:44.985
- Yes, you were Wendy,
and I was the dog.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.354
- Yeah!

04:46.387 --> 04:47.855
- Yeah, I had the big,
red barrel.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.623
- Right! Of course...
- You were so talented.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.359
- You were--
you were talented!

04:51.392 --> 04:53.060
- Well. [barks]
Thank you.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.828
- Wasn't that the best
summer ever?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.364
Ever!
- It was magical.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.098
- Singing and jumping
in the lakes...

04:58.131 --> 05:00.568
- And playing
Spin the Bottle...

05:04.071 --> 05:05.539
I'm gonna let you
get settled in.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.574
- Okay.
- Okay?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.075
- All right.
Thank you.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.511
It's ni--funny
to see you again.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.483
- Malik!
- Sit.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.984
A celebrity couple
came to me today,

05:17.017 --> 05:18.586
and they want me
to find them a surrogate

05:18.619 --> 05:19.987
so that they can have
a new baby.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.489
- Who is it?
Who's the celebrity couple?

05:21.522 --> 05:22.856
- I'm not telling you
who it is.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.124
Now, listen:
if you want

05:24.157 --> 05:25.759
great photos
on the red carpet,

05:25.793 --> 05:27.761
champagne
in your hotel room,

05:27.795 --> 05:29.630
methamphetamines
after midnight,

05:29.663 --> 05:31.365
I'm the girl to come to.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.667
But I don't know where to find
anybody a uterus!

05:33.701 --> 05:36.470
- [laughs]
Are you...asking me

05:36.504 --> 05:38.639
if I would be the uterus--

05:38.672 --> 05:41.041
- Staci, I would never
ask for your uterus, okay?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.610
We need a young,

05:42.643 --> 05:45.413
a fresh, a new uterus...
- Okay. Okay.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.648
- Not one that's all
haggard and used up.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.883
- I got it.
- Okay, well.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.685
If you can do that for me,

05:51.719 --> 05:54.422
I'll get you George Clooney
and Amal on "Nightcap."

05:54.455 --> 05:55.989
- I will get you that uterus.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.659
- Hurry up!

05:58.692 --> 06:01.061
c- Monday, Tuesday...
[pills clattering]

06:01.094 --> 06:02.596
Wednesday--
- Oh! There you are.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.864
- Hey.
- Hi. Sorry.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.599
I know you're at lunch.
- Thanks.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.436
- Here.
Just a little champagne.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.803
I know, I know,
you don't drink,

06:09.837 --> 06:11.839
but just have a little
after your charcoal pill.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.073
- Oh!
[giggling]

06:13.106 --> 06:15.042
What's going on?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.511
There must be
some good news.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.112
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.681
- Are you ovulating?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.082
- Yes!
- Okay, Penny,

06:22.115 --> 06:23.684
do you know in "Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory"

06:23.717 --> 06:25.619
when Charlie finds
the Golden Ticket?

06:25.653 --> 06:27.020
- No.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.823
- I found yours.
- Where?

06:29.857 --> 06:31.559
- There's a famous
celebrity couple,

06:31.592 --> 06:33.661
and they're looking
for a surrogate.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.096
- Who is it?
- I don't know!

06:36.129 --> 06:37.565
But you're gonna
meet them soon,

06:37.598 --> 06:38.799
because you're gonna have
an interview.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.133
They're gonna ask you
a few questions.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.535
- No. I don't do well
in interviews.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.136
- It's like taking
an eye exam.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.905
- I'm legally blind
in my left eye.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.974
- Okay, you might want
to keep that to yourself.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.642
Let's try it.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.612
Uh...for instance,
family history.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.946
Is there any alcoholism?

06:52.980 --> 06:54.081
- Yes.
- Okay.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.115
Let's--zzzt.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.684
Let's try, um...

06:56.717 --> 06:58.519
is there any...incest?

06:58.552 --> 07:00.688
- My great-grandfather--

07:00.721 --> 07:01.989
- Okay.
So that's a yes.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.658
And what about...
cannibalism?

07:04.692 --> 07:06.126
- Do you know
the Donner Party?

07:06.159 --> 07:08.596
- Yes.
- On my father's side.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.064
- Okay, so there's some
alcoholism, there's some incest.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.700
There's some cannibalism,

07:12.733 --> 07:15.936
and probably a lot of
mental health issues.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.805
Best you don't say
anything.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.139
Let me do all the talking.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.808
- Okay!
- Okay!

07:20.841 --> 07:23.010
Let's make a baby.
- Cheers.

[lively trumpet music]

07:31.051 --> 07:32.219

the greenroom.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.654
Andy Cohen!
- Hi.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.888
- Staci Cole.
Gosh!

07:34.922 --> 07:36.023
Why has it taken
so long

07:36.056 --> 07:37.725
to get you to do
this show?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.927
- Well, 'cause Jimmy's
a racist homophobe, so...

07:39.960 --> 07:41.529
but I got a new show
to promote.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.263
- I get it.
No, he's a complicated guy.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.898
But we're so happy
you're here.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.534
- Yeah, me too.
- So a new show on Bravo.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.001
That's exciting.
- Yeah.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.137
- It's, um,
"Broadway Smash"?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.940
- "Broadway Smash-Up."
It's a singing torture show.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.041
It's amazing.
You're gonna love it.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.576
- Oh, I can't wait.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.778
So, listen, as you know,
Jimmy is--mmm-mm--

07:57.811 --> 08:00.514
and I'm gonna really have
to brief him on this.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.249
So can you walk me
through the show?

08:02.282 --> 08:04.151
- Okay. Uh, so let's pretend
you're on the show.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.753
- Okay.
- Right?

08:05.786 --> 08:07.955
Pretend you're a celebrity.
- Okay. Yes?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.958
- Okay. And you just
pick a song from a Broadway show

08:10.991 --> 08:13.260
and sing it,
and no matter what happens,

08:13.293 --> 08:14.528
don't get distracted.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.963
- All right.
- All right?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.164
- I'm gonna choose
something from my childhood,

08:17.197 --> 08:18.866
when I had very bad acne--

08:18.899 --> 08:19.933
- Doesn't matter.
Just sing.

08:19.967 --> 08:20.934
- Great.
- Okay.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.135
- Um...

08:22.169 --> 08:23.637
* One

08:23.671 --> 08:25.706
* Singular sensation

08:25.739 --> 08:27.541
- Sing out.
- * Every little step

08:27.575 --> 08:29.042
* She takes
- Get into it, get into it!

08:29.076 --> 08:31.144
- * Da da da da da da da, one
- Feel it...

08:31.178 --> 08:33.246
Sell it, work it!
- * Moment in da-da-da

08:33.280 --> 08:34.882
* Everything

08:34.915 --> 08:36.817
* That she takes
- All right, okay!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.686
- * One smile
- Okay, you're screwing up...

08:38.719 --> 08:40.954
- * And suddenly nobody
- The lyrics a little bit.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.856
- * Else...will...
- Okay.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.292
- Oh!
* Do, da da da da da da da

08:45.325 --> 08:47.695
* For the one who's second
- Good!

08:47.728 --> 08:51.665
- * Rate to none
- Keep singing.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.133
- What are you doing
with my food?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.268
- Throwing it at Staci.
- Oh. Good.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.938
I thought you were wasting it.
- * Really have to mention

08:57.971 --> 08:59.006
* She
Oh!

08:59.039 --> 09:00.240
- Yes.
- Yes!

09:00.273 --> 09:02.042
- * She's
- Serve it!

09:02.075 --> 09:04.077
Serve it!
- * The

09:04.111 --> 09:06.113
I got it--I...

09:06.146 --> 09:07.848
* One
I got it--it's funny.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.650
- You get it now?

09:13.621 --> 09:15.255
- Oh. Hi, Todd.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.790
- Oh, hey, Randy.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.159
- Are you just sitting
in here by yourself?

09:19.192 --> 09:21.629
- Oh, you noticed?

09:21.662 --> 09:23.897
Yeah, I...
better get used to it.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.332
- What do you mean?
- Pretty sure I'm kicked out

09:25.365 --> 09:27.668
of Jimmy's inner circle.
- Hey.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.137
Have you seen
my walkie-talkie?

09:31.905 --> 09:34.141
I was making a number two,

09:34.174 --> 09:36.944
and I put it on the floor
of the bathroom,

09:36.977 --> 09:38.879
and then someone
just took it.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.948
And I yelled at him
to bring it back,

09:40.981 --> 09:42.149
but he just ignored me.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.917
I think he had brown shoes.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.919
- It's not in here, Phil.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.021
- You guys
talking about chicks?

09:48.055 --> 09:50.724
- No. We're talking about how
Jimmy doesn't like me anymore.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.192
- Why?

09:52.225 --> 09:54.061
- I'm the only one
that didn't get a watch.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.929
I've been around long enough
to know what that means.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.165
First the gifts stop.
Then no more trips.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.000
Then he kicks you
out of the house.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.770
That's what he did with his
handicapped brother, Jeb.

10:02.803 --> 10:06.173
- Yeah, but he had you
hand out the watches.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.675
He wouldn't have
made you do that

10:07.708 --> 10:09.342
if he wasn't gonna
give you one.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.079
He's not that cruel.
- Tell that to his brother Jeb.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.314
He's now in Times Square
begging tourists for cash

10:14.347 --> 10:16.884
dressed as a dirty Olaf.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.987
- There, there.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.289
- That felt nice.
Can you do that again?

10:25.358 --> 10:27.828
[energetic drumming]

10:27.861 --> 10:29.863
- Why, um, why--
Did you just work out?

10:29.897 --> 10:31.064
Is that why
you're dressed like that?

10:31.098 --> 10:32.700
- Oh, God,
no, no, no, no, no.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.035
I'm--I was, uh...
I was briefing Andy,

10:35.068 --> 10:37.204
and he ended up
throwing food at me.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.206
- Classic Cohen.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.308
- Well, it's great
to see you again.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.910
- Yeah, it's...
- Jaws.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.211
[both chuckle]
- Yeah, well...

10:44.244 --> 10:45.813
I got veneers.
- Oh, wow.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.080
- Yeah.
- Oh, those are good.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.116
- Yeah!
- Those look so real.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.684
- Yeah.
- 'Cause they're even, like,

10:50.718 --> 10:52.385
slightly uneven.
They do like a...

10:52.419 --> 10:54.054
- They make it real.
- Make it real.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.156
- They make it real, yeah.
- That's amazing.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.059
- Yeah. Anyway, it's so fun
to reminisce, isn't it?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.994
- Yeah, it is fun to reminisce.
- Yeah.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.930
Do you remember
the last night of camp?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.431
- Yeah, I mean, sort of.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.099
We did the show, right?
And then we--

11:06.133 --> 11:07.968
Oh! Then we all went, um...

11:08.001 --> 11:10.738
didn't we all swim, like,
at midnight in the lake?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.239
- Yep. And then you don't
remember it was cold?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.841
It was August.
We all ran inside.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.843
And the other girls wanted
to go do s'mores

11:15.876 --> 11:17.845
and get patches and sing.
- Right, right, right.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.847
Sort of, sort of, yeah.
- Sing some songs.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.715
And you said,
"I love fireflies,"

11:21.749 --> 11:23.751
and I said, "I--"
- I still love fireflies.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.018
- I know!

11:25.052 --> 11:26.419
So you were running
after the fireflies,

11:26.453 --> 11:28.221
and I was running
after you, and, you know,

11:28.255 --> 11:30.123
off we went through the meadow.
- You remember so many details.

11:30.157 --> 11:33.160
- I do, I do.
I remember, like, the...

11:33.193 --> 11:34.962
you know, the wheat...
- What's that?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.463
- Hitting me in the stomach
as we ran through the field.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.298
- Oh, my God!
- And it was stars and the moo--

11:38.331 --> 11:39.466
- My God.
- I think the moon,

11:39.499 --> 11:41.401
because you were lit
like an angel.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.403
And we were in the middle
of the field.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.338
We both turned at the same time
to say something,

11:45.372 --> 11:46.940
or maybe you were gonna
sing something,

11:46.974 --> 11:49.276
and then we just--
we...kissed.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.013
We had this big kiss...
- No.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.281
- In the field.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.216
- No. I don't remember that.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.752
- You--you stroked my hair
very softly.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.821
It's one of those things--
- I just don't remember that.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.223
- Yeah, all right.
[mumbles] It's not a big deal.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.192
I just--I never got
closure,

12:05.225 --> 12:07.394
and now I have closure,
so we're all good.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.862
So have a great show.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.164
I'm gonna go check
on your limo.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.337
[whispering]
Oh, so stupid!

12:17.370 --> 12:19.072
Why did I have to say that?

12:19.106 --> 12:20.974
*

12:21.008 --> 12:23.777
- So, Sofia,
17 years into "Modern Family."

12:23.811 --> 12:25.779
- [as Sofia] Yes. And I do...
- Oh, hey.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.147
- The Coke commercials.
- Here you guys are.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.182
- See?
- It's so fun.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.018
- Hey.
- Have you guys seen Todd today?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.552
- I know, I know.
- No, seriously.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.254
He's, like, really upset.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.324
I've never seen a man
so broken by a watch before.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.426
- Let me just fix it, okay?
You know what, Penny?

12:39.459 --> 12:43.864
Put my watch in the box
and give it to Todd.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.566
- Oh, my God.
I'm gonna cry!

12:46.599 --> 12:49.937
- Don't cry.
- That is the sweetest thing.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.404
Wait--do you want
my watch?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.373
- No. No, no, no.
You keep it.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.042
- I'll take it.
- No. You won't take it.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.376
You will take mine.
You will put it in a box.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.411
You will give it to Todd.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.013
And I save the day.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.048
- Okay.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.116
*

13:03.150 --> 13:05.418
- All I'm saying is this could
make or break your life, okay?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.020
- Okay.
- So just be normal.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.356
- Oh, my God!

13:09.389 --> 13:11.591
Kelly Ripa
and Mark Consuelos!

13:11.624 --> 13:13.193
Put your baby in me!

13:13.226 --> 13:14.594
- [laughs]

13:14.627 --> 13:16.029
- She signed an NDA, right?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.030
- Of course.
- Yes.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.565
- Mark, Kelly,

13:18.598 --> 13:20.233
this is Penny.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.135
- Hi.
- Hi, Penny.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.370
Welcome.
We are, uh--

13:23.403 --> 13:24.872
we're so excited
to meet you.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.073
- And I you.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.507
- I'm Staci Cole.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.610
I'm gonna do your s--
- They know who you are.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.913
- So, um, Penny,

13:32.946 --> 13:37.084
please tell us about your
overall health.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.852
- Uh...it's not--

13:38.886 --> 13:40.120
It's not...
- It's great.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.254
- Not an issue.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.622
It's not an issue.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.391
I'm currently
pumping my body

13:44.424 --> 13:46.559
full of herbs and vitamins

13:46.593 --> 13:49.429
or "veetymins"
as they say in England.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.463
I don't know why
I just said that.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.232
- [laughs, murmurs]

13:52.265 --> 13:53.600
- It's true, they do say--
- They say it like that.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.468
They'll say, like...
- "Vitt-amins."

13:55.502 --> 13:58.071
- Alu-min-ium.
- Alu-min-ium.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.140
- Yeah. They also say
can't.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.309
- They say can't a lot.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.411
- Cunt.
- [whispers] No.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.979
- Why do you think
you're fit

14:06.013 --> 14:08.148
to carry a celebrity child
in your...

14:08.181 --> 14:10.050
in your womb?
- I feel like

14:10.083 --> 14:11.484
it was what I was

14:11.518 --> 14:13.386
born to do, like a nun.
- [mouthing words]

14:13.420 --> 14:15.923
- It's the perfect job
for me.

14:15.956 --> 14:20.227
You know, I work around
celebrities every day,

14:20.260 --> 14:21.895
and I have a uterus,

14:21.929 --> 14:23.596
but I've never actually
put it to use,

14:23.630 --> 14:26.033
and I'm really excited
to see if it works.

14:26.066 --> 14:30.403
And to help two of the best
people in the world

14:30.437 --> 14:32.272
bring a new life
into the world

14:32.305 --> 14:33.974
would make me...

14:34.007 --> 14:36.109
[voice breaking]
Whole.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.610
- [chuckles]

14:37.644 --> 14:40.247
- Tell us about
your sexual history.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.350
- Oh. There really
isn't one to speak of.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.086
I mean, in a normal way.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.620
I mean...I get mine,

14:47.654 --> 14:49.957
but I'm no floozy.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.491
- That's okay.
We're not here to judge, just--

14:51.524 --> 14:53.660
- That's exactly
what we're here to do.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.195
We're here to judge.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.364
Would you have sexual
intercourse

14:57.397 --> 14:59.632
while our baby
was inside you?

14:59.666 --> 15:00.700
- [mouthing]

15:00.733 --> 15:02.102
- No.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.603
No.
- No?

15:04.671 --> 15:05.939
- Yes.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.308
- Yes?
- Whatever you want.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.945
- Do you have any...
pets or herpes?

15:11.979 --> 15:13.213
- No.
Not that I know of.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.714
- Um...

15:14.747 --> 15:18.518
would you...
be having sex

15:18.551 --> 15:20.988
during the pregnancy?
- We covered that.

15:21.021 --> 15:24.191
That was asked and answered.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.193
Can we ask her
about herpes again?

15:26.226 --> 15:29.362
- I think that's an issue
that we both agree

15:29.396 --> 15:32.132
is the reason
we have a surrogate.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.235
Thank you so much
for coming by and meeting us.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.669
It was really a pleasure.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.006
- Really?
- Really.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.473
- [emotionally]
Oh! Really?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.475
- She said, "Really."

15:42.509 --> 15:44.644
- Okay.
- Thanks.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.712
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:45.745 --> 15:46.980
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

15:50.117 --> 15:53.320
[energetic brass music]

15:53.353 --> 15:55.488
- Hey, look what I got!

15:55.522 --> 15:57.390
- Look at that!
- Mm-hmm.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.359
- That's exciting!

15:59.392 --> 16:00.727
- Jimmy loves you so much.
- I know.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.295
He walked right up to me.
He was like,

16:02.329 --> 16:03.997
"Yo, I wanted to save
the best for last."

16:04.031 --> 16:05.498
Then he gave me this watch.
- Wait, wait, wait.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.700
Jimmy came up to you
and gave you that watch?

16:07.734 --> 16:09.069
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get this.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.303
When I went back to my desk,

16:10.337 --> 16:12.272
there was a second watch!

16:12.305 --> 16:13.606
- What?
- [laughing] Yeah!

16:13.640 --> 16:15.542
There's two watches now!

16:15.575 --> 16:17.644
- Oh...
[groans]

16:17.677 --> 16:19.346
- Yeah. Penny, ask me
what time it is.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.747
- What time is it, Todd?
- I'll tell ya.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.482
It's 7:00.
[laughs]

16:22.515 --> 16:25.685
And...it's 7:00.
What--now it's 7:01.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.520
Is it 7:01?
Yeah, it's 7:01.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.557
- We're all really excited
for you down here, Todd.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.159
- Not only did he give me
two watches,

16:32.192 --> 16:34.194
he handed me
this briefcase, right?

16:34.227 --> 16:35.662
Told me I was doing
a good job.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.331
It's filled with...
a-cash!

16:38.365 --> 16:41.668
- Fuckin'-A!
That's good stuff!

16:41.701 --> 16:43.370
- [laughing]
Yeah!

16:43.403 --> 16:44.704
*

16:44.737 --> 16:46.273
- So we'll come back
from commercial,

16:46.306 --> 16:47.707
and Jimmy
will introduce you.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.342
You'll go out.
You'll sit in the chairs.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.111
And then I thought it'd be
really fun to start with

16:51.144 --> 16:54.581
your story about on the mountain
with Barry Sonnenfeld and...

16:54.614 --> 16:56.583
- Yeah, well, we were
very high on Molly.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.286
- Oh, well, drugs...
gives it a layer. And--

16:59.319 --> 17:00.287
- What time is it?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.289
It's Invisalign time.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.058
Remember?
24 on, 2 off.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.360
24 on, 2 off.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.230
- All right, so I'm gonna
let you guys, uh,

17:10.263 --> 17:13.366
get ready, and I'll come
back in a little while

17:13.400 --> 17:14.401
and get you miked.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.202
- That sounds great.
- Thank you.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.769
- I do want to just quickly
ask you,

17:16.803 --> 17:18.338
what did you think of Penny?
- Oh!

17:18.371 --> 17:19.639
Penny, uh...
- Penny.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.740
- From the other room.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.143
- She's a terr-ific surrogate.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.677
- We've made a decision...
- [gasps]

17:24.711 --> 17:26.546
- And we just want to
tell her in person ourselves.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.115
- I'll go get her.
- Yeah.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.282
- Oh, that'd be great.
- All right!

17:29.316 --> 17:30.483
- Thanks so much.
- All right.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.851
Stand by for the uterus.
- Okay, thanks.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.221
- [whispering]
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

17:34.254 --> 17:36.189
Ah! Penny.
Oh--did you fart?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.490
- No! No.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.393
This is sage Palo Santo
and lavender

17:40.427 --> 17:43.263
to cleanse the space
and remove negative energy.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.797
It's just been feeling
super weird

17:44.831 --> 17:47.367
and a little bad vibey
since Kanye was here.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.768
- Get it. Listen,
Kelly and Mark are here,

17:48.801 --> 17:50.503
and they have an answer.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.872
- [gasps] Oh, my God!
Is this what I think it means?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.474
- [gibberish]
- Blah--

17:54.507 --> 17:57.577
- Okay, all right.
Let me just...

17:57.610 --> 17:59.612
Okay, all right.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.114
Let's just do the hair back.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.749
Pink cheeks.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.551
Let's get the feeders up.
Ooh! You should wear a bra.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.586
And...

18:09.656 --> 18:11.558
All right.
Let's go make a baby.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.559
- [laughs]

18:12.592 --> 18:15.462
*

18:15.495 --> 18:17.197
- Here she is.
- [yawns]

18:17.230 --> 18:18.565
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.400
- So, um, like we said,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.569
we loved meeting you.
- Yes.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.204
Thank you so much
for coming here

18:24.237 --> 18:25.572
and talking with us.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.873
- I do work here,

18:26.906 --> 18:28.441
but it was my sincere honor.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.410
- Well, listen,
we thought about it a lot,

18:30.443 --> 18:31.811
and, uh...
- Yep.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.647
- We've decided
to go in another direction.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.416
- Huh?
- What?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.785
- Yeah, no...
you talking with us

18:38.818 --> 18:42.222
really helped us decide
what we really want

18:42.255 --> 18:44.424
in a surrogate and...

18:44.457 --> 18:45.592
- [sobbing]

18:45.625 --> 18:49.162
Can I just ask why?

18:49.196 --> 18:51.564
- Uh, sweetie,
it's show business.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.666
It's nothing perso--
it's not you.

18:53.700 --> 18:58.438
- [talking indistinctly
while crying]

18:58.471 --> 18:59.672
- Eh...

18:59.706 --> 19:01.508
- Yeah, you see,
that whole thing

19:01.541 --> 19:03.610
was why we made
our decision.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.313
- Look, sweetie, I'm certain...
- [inhales, exhales]

19:06.346 --> 19:08.881
- That your womb will make
another celebrity couple

19:08.915 --> 19:10.350
very happy.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.185
- Yeah, other--
other celebrity couples.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.620
- Really?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.388
- Absolutely.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.889
- That's good stuff, right?

19:16.923 --> 19:19.626
That's something to put
your eggs in a basket for.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.394
Okay.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.263
*

19:23.296 --> 19:24.631
You were great
on the show, really.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.466
- Thank you.
- One of the best shows.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.568
Thank you so much.
- Thank you for having me.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.902
- You know what?
I just realized

19:29.936 --> 19:31.871
where I know you from,
and I'm sorry,

19:31.904 --> 19:33.673
but I'm a Miranda.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.375
- No apologies necessary.
Understood.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.843
Happens to a lot of people.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.945
Do you mind taking that
to the car?

19:38.978 --> 19:40.947
And I'll be right there.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.215
- Sure.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.419
- I'm sorry I brought up
the kiss.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.820
- Staci. Staci.
- It was so wrong.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.756
- Stop.
- I--

20:03.436 --> 20:05.805
- I always remembered.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.607
I never forgot.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.743
And now...I have closure.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.347
[rapidly departing footsteps]

20:18.618 --> 20:20.787
- * One...

20:20.820 --> 20:23.022
* Singular sensation

20:23.055 --> 20:26.025
* Every little step
she takes *

20:26.058 --> 20:27.627
* Ba na na na na na

20:27.660 --> 20:29.629
* One
[snaps fingers] Yeah!

20:29.662 --> 20:31.864
* Moment in pleasure

20:31.898 --> 20:35.335
* Every move that she makes
