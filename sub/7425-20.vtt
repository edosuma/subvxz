00:00.220 --> 00:02.104
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

00:02.525 --> 00:04.591
I'm Special Agent
Henry Knox, FBI.

00:04.626 --> 00:06.693
What if I can
get Vincent exonerated?

00:06.728 --> 00:08.462
How dare you?!

00:08.497 --> 00:10.031
First you promise
to help Vincent

00:10.065 --> 00:11.432
and then you try
to get him arrested?

00:11.466 --> 00:13.300
<i>Maybe it's time</i>
<i>that we dig up something</i>

00:13.335 --> 00:15.136
from Gabe's past
and put him on the defensive.

00:15.504 --> 00:17.104
Jack Watson?
- Yeah.

00:17.139 --> 00:18.472
Do you mind if
I ask you a few questions?

00:18.507 --> 00:20.607
About a murder you witnessed
at the museum.

00:20.642 --> 00:23.443
Turn to your right.

00:23.477 --> 00:25.946
That's him.
Number four.

00:25.980 --> 00:27.881
And Ward put Jack
into protective custody

00:27.916 --> 00:28.982
until after the arraignment.

00:29.017 --> 00:30.383
And the bad news?

00:30.418 --> 00:31.518
Gabe made bail.

00:31.553 --> 00:32.619
Of course he did.

00:48.235 --> 00:50.703
Hey.

00:54.074 --> 00:55.708
Oh, my God, Vincent,
I'm so sorry.

00:55.742 --> 00:56.776
Are you okay?

00:57.911 --> 00:59.478
Yeah, you might've just
bruised my ego.

00:59.512 --> 01:01.413
If you want, you could always
turn me in, too.

01:01.448 --> 01:04.849
I hear the reward's
$100,000 now.

01:04.885 --> 01:06.652
Wait, a hundred grand?

01:06.687 --> 01:08.353
Mm-hmm. Come on,
you could be a hero,

01:08.388 --> 01:10.689
get your badge back.

01:10.723 --> 01:12.157
Maybe put a
little deposit on that

01:12.192 --> 01:14.326
house in the mountains
you always wanted.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.927
No. You wanted
the place in the mountains,

01:15.962 --> 01:17.262
I wanted the country.

01:17.297 --> 01:19.098
Well, right now,
I would take either.

01:19.132 --> 01:20.566
Okay. When do we leave?

01:20.600 --> 01:22.234
Really?

01:23.636 --> 01:24.736
You would really leave?

01:24.770 --> 01:26.338
Seriously...

01:26.372 --> 01:28.773
Gabe has everyone in this city
hunting you down;

01:28.808 --> 01:30.909
I'm ducking tails
just to see you.

01:30.943 --> 01:32.611
What would we be
leaving behind?

01:32.645 --> 01:34.345
Home.

01:34.379 --> 01:36.114
I don't know,

01:36.148 --> 01:38.216
maybe it's just a fantasy,
but...

01:38.250 --> 01:40.085
I can't help but think
what it would be like

01:40.119 --> 01:41.686
to leave all this
craziness behind.

01:41.721 --> 01:43.021
Come on,
we're making progress, right?

01:43.055 --> 01:44.422
As soon as the witness

01:44.456 --> 01:46.023
testifies against Gabe,

01:46.057 --> 01:48.126
he's gonna be behind bars
and then he'll be off my back

01:48.160 --> 01:49.594
and Agent Knox
can push this

01:49.628 --> 01:51.129
exoneration through.

01:51.163 --> 01:52.630
Everything
will be back to normal.

01:52.664 --> 01:54.732
"Normal"? What's normal?

01:54.766 --> 01:57.067
I don't know,
whatever you want it to be.

01:57.102 --> 01:58.636
It doesn't have to be

01:58.670 --> 01:59.970
this or here.

02:00.005 --> 02:01.071
It'll be our normal.

02:01.106 --> 02:03.273
I like the sound of that.

02:05.910 --> 02:07.778
Mm, phone.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.314
It's Tess.

02:11.349 --> 02:14.251
Impeccable timing, as always.

02:14.285 --> 02:16.786
Cat, something's happened,
Watson's missing.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.087
Wait, what are you
talking about, what happened?

02:18.122 --> 02:20.490
The witness, Jack Watson,
he's gone.

02:20.525 --> 02:22.259
Gone how?
He was in protective custody.

02:22.293 --> 02:23.993
What happened to the uniform
that was guarding him?

02:24.028 --> 02:25.595
Knocked out-- tranq dart.

02:25.630 --> 02:27.664
Peters and Garcia,
you're with me.

02:27.698 --> 02:29.432
Gabe.
- Yeah.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.268
Just got back
from the safe house,

02:31.302 --> 02:32.269
signs of a struggle,
but nothing else.

02:32.303 --> 02:33.836
No leads on where Watson is.

02:33.871 --> 02:34.971
What about Gabe?

02:35.005 --> 02:36.305
I'm heading to his place now.

02:36.339 --> 02:37.940
I just got the warrant,
but, uh...

02:37.975 --> 02:39.441
I'm gonna need help
finding the witness.

02:39.476 --> 02:41.343
If you know what I mean.
I'll track him.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.845
You can't.
What if someone sees you?

02:42.880 --> 02:44.280
We don't have a choice, okay?

02:44.314 --> 02:45.915
We lose the witness,
we lose Gabe, we lose...

02:45.949 --> 02:47.416
our chance at normal.

02:47.450 --> 02:49.118
Be careful.
Tip line's ringing off the hook.

02:49.153 --> 02:50.619
People think they're seeing
Vincent everywhere now.

02:50.654 --> 02:52.321
Let me know.
- Okay.

02:52.355 --> 02:53.989
- All right, let's go, come on.

02:54.023 --> 02:55.224
Come on,
let's go, let's go.

03:19.381 --> 03:21.183
Tess! I'm glad you're here.

03:21.217 --> 03:24.686
Gabe...
- Look, I know that Cat thinks

03:24.720 --> 03:26.221
that I had something to do with
Heather's kidnapping,

03:26.255 --> 03:27.655
but you got to talk to her,

03:27.690 --> 03:28.789
because she doesn't have
all of the facts...

03:28.824 --> 03:30.625
Gabe!

03:30.659 --> 03:34.028
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.534
What's going on?

03:40.568 --> 03:42.302
I think you know
what's going on.

03:42.337 --> 03:43.637
You're wanted
for questioning

03:43.671 --> 03:45.472
in the disappearance
of Jack Watson.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.008
Cuff him.

04:00.455 --> 04:01.688
All clear.

04:04.425 --> 04:06.126
I don't have a key.

04:07.395 --> 04:08.995
I do.

04:12.099 --> 04:14.000
So much for being careful.

04:14.034 --> 04:16.836
I'm telling you...

04:16.870 --> 04:18.437
Gabe has
completely lost it.

04:18.471 --> 04:20.005
I don't know what it is--

04:20.040 --> 04:23.176
losing you, chasing me--

04:23.210 --> 04:25.245
but the guy has
definitely snapped.

04:25.279 --> 04:27.213
Yeah, it all feels
vaguely familiar, doesn't it?

04:27.248 --> 04:29.682
You really think
Gabe took Watson?

04:29.716 --> 04:30.916
No. Just because
he's acting like

04:30.950 --> 04:32.184
some crazed beast again

04:32.218 --> 04:33.286
doesn't mean
he is one, right?

04:33.320 --> 04:35.254
Let's see what
really happened.

04:36.956 --> 04:38.190
Help!

04:44.665 --> 04:45.931
Besides...

04:48.601 --> 04:50.969
...he didn't
kill Watson as a beast.

04:51.004 --> 04:53.238
Gabe killed him?

04:59.578 --> 05:01.946
Yeah, he killed him,
all right.

05:01.980 --> 05:03.581
Oh, my God.

05:03.616 --> 05:05.617
I promised Jack
that we'd protect him.

05:05.651 --> 05:08.052
And that was before you knew
how desperate Gabe had become.

05:21.366 --> 05:23.301
He's bleeding.

05:23.335 --> 05:24.302
I should be able to
track him

05:24.336 --> 05:26.237
to wherever
he took the body.

05:26.271 --> 05:28.272
Hopefully
before getting spotted.

05:28.307 --> 05:29.807
<i>I am telling you,</i>

05:29.842 --> 05:31.342
you've got the wrong guy!

05:31.376 --> 05:33.444
How stupid would I have to be
to want to hurt a witness

05:33.478 --> 05:35.178
who's about to testify
against me?

05:35.213 --> 05:38.515
Yet Mr. Watson's
mysteriously missing.

05:38.550 --> 05:40.351
Right, because Vincent Keller
is trying to set me up.

05:40.385 --> 05:41.585
Don't you see?

05:41.619 --> 05:42.820
He's the one
you should be looking for.

05:42.854 --> 05:44.588
Give me a break!
Sergeant Vargas, please.

05:44.622 --> 05:46.590
Think about it, Captain...

05:46.624 --> 05:48.158
we were closing in
on Keller, right?

05:48.192 --> 05:50.260
Then, all of a sudden,
a murder witness

05:50.294 --> 05:51.494
magically pops up

05:51.528 --> 05:52.963
and identifies me,
of all people?

05:52.997 --> 05:54.931
And then he disappears before

05:54.966 --> 05:56.166
you even have a chance
to question him?

05:56.200 --> 05:57.633
I mean, come on!

05:57.668 --> 05:59.369
So, what, you're suggesting
Vincent Keller

05:59.403 --> 06:00.436
is behind all this?

06:00.471 --> 06:02.005
Of course he is,
Captain.

06:02.039 --> 06:05.275
What better way to divert
attention from the manhunt,

06:05.309 --> 06:07.344
then to try and blame me
for one of his crimes?

06:09.747 --> 06:11.848
How do we even know
Watson's still alive?

06:14.418 --> 06:15.651
Think about it.

06:15.686 --> 06:16.986
For all we know,

06:17.020 --> 06:18.460
Gabe could have
silenced the witness.

06:18.489 --> 06:19.555
Maybe even killed him.

06:19.590 --> 06:20.857
And this is just a
desperate attempt

06:20.891 --> 06:22.792
to save his ass.

06:22.826 --> 06:23.959
What else is she gonna say,
Captain?

06:23.994 --> 06:26.362
She is Detective Chandler's
best friend.

06:26.396 --> 06:27.696
Of course she's gonna do

06:27.730 --> 06:29.731
everything she can
to defend her boyfriend.

06:29.766 --> 06:31.967
That's not an answer.
He's knows damn well

06:32.002 --> 06:33.668
that Watson identified him
in the lineup.

06:33.703 --> 06:35.670
What more motive
does he need?

06:35.705 --> 06:36.972
All right, then, Detective,
prove it.

06:37.007 --> 06:38.340
Where's the body?

06:40.576 --> 06:41.576
All right.

06:42.612 --> 06:43.845
You're still
under the conditions

06:43.880 --> 06:44.880
of your bail, Lowan,

06:44.914 --> 06:46.347
which means
you don't leave the city

06:46.382 --> 06:48.082
without court authorization.
Do you understand?

06:48.117 --> 06:50.318
I am not going
anywhere, Captain.

06:50.352 --> 06:53.154
I am innocent. Trust me.

06:53.188 --> 06:56.858
Vincent Keller is the man
you are after, not me.

07:11.273 --> 07:13.974
Which way did Gabe go?

07:15.710 --> 07:17.110
You know what?

07:17.145 --> 07:19.246
I don't know, okay,

07:19.280 --> 07:20.448
I've lost the trail.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.015
Okay, well,
find it quickly,

07:22.050 --> 07:23.918
'cause there are
a lot of people here.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
All right, I got him.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.103
Vincent.

07:43.137 --> 07:45.072
That's him.
That's the fugitive.

07:45.106 --> 07:46.239
That's the guy from
the television!

07:46.274 --> 07:47.707
That's him.
Somebody stop him!

07:47.741 --> 07:49.576
It's that Keller guy.
- Officers!

07:49.610 --> 07:51.143
Right there.

07:51.178 --> 07:52.846
It's Keller.
- Run.

07:59.419 --> 08:01.120
Move it, move it.

08:11.332 --> 08:13.119
Are you sure it was
Vincent Keller.

08:13.143 --> 08:14.195
Are you kidding?

08:14.196 --> 08:16.002
The guy's face is plastered
all over the news.

08:16.003 --> 08:17.237
I recognized him right away.

08:17.271 --> 08:18.904
Did you try
to stop him?

08:18.939 --> 08:20.940
Are you out of your mind?!
No way.

08:20.974 --> 08:22.308
But I called out to the cops,

08:22.343 --> 08:24.243
and they-they chased him
all the way down Third,

08:24.277 --> 08:25.445
but he got away.

08:27.113 --> 08:28.514
First of all,

08:28.549 --> 08:30.950
you're just jeopardizing
my job by even being here.

08:30.984 --> 08:32.424
Second, how the hell
am I supposed to

08:32.453 --> 08:34.686
clear your name when
I turn on the news...

08:34.721 --> 08:36.121
What was I
supposed to do, okay?

08:36.155 --> 08:37.823
Just let Gabe
get away with it?

08:37.857 --> 08:39.158
You need him discredited,

08:39.192 --> 08:40.993
so he can't block
my exoneration, right?

08:41.027 --> 08:42.707
And on top of all of that,
he killed a man.

08:42.729 --> 08:44.196
That's why
we're tracking him.

08:44.231 --> 08:45.865
Wait, I'm confused.

08:45.899 --> 08:47.333
How exactly were you
tracking him again?

08:47.367 --> 08:48.367
Were you...
actually following him?

08:48.401 --> 08:50.202
Yes. No.
- No.

08:50.237 --> 08:52.036
No. Not literally.

08:52.071 --> 08:53.638
We're just...
trying to figure out

08:53.673 --> 08:55.841
where he was taking the body...
that's all.

08:55.875 --> 08:56.875
You know, following leads,

08:56.909 --> 08:58.877
asking people in the area if
they'd seen Gabe

08:58.911 --> 09:00.479
or his car drive by.

09:00.513 --> 09:01.880
That kind of tracking.

09:01.914 --> 09:04.315
Wait, so you were actually
talking to people

09:04.350 --> 09:05.650
face-to-face?

09:05.685 --> 09:07.285
People who could
and did recognize you?

09:07.319 --> 09:09.020
Are you out of your mind?

09:09.054 --> 09:10.721
Agent Knox, he killed a man,
okay, last year.

09:10.756 --> 09:12.123
And we had an eyewitness

09:12.157 --> 09:13.391
who was gonna
testify against him,

09:13.425 --> 09:14.625
but he killed him, too.

09:14.659 --> 09:16.127
You <i>say</i> that,
but how do you know that?

09:16.161 --> 09:17.161
How can you prove it?

09:17.196 --> 09:18.196
By finding the body,

09:18.197 --> 09:19.463
wherever he put it.

09:19.498 --> 09:21.465
That's all we're trying to do.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.733
And then all
hell broke loose

09:22.768 --> 09:24.129
and you almost
got yourself caught.

09:25.036 --> 09:26.904
Look...

09:26.938 --> 09:28.906
I owe you both,
you know that.

09:28.940 --> 09:30.374
That's why
I'm trying like hell

09:30.409 --> 09:32.877
to get you exonerated,
but if you don't lay low

09:32.911 --> 09:35.312
and keep this from
getting out of control...

09:35.346 --> 09:37.247
It's already
out of control, Agent Knox.

09:37.282 --> 09:38.348
That's why we're here.

09:38.383 --> 09:40.717
There is nowhere
safe anymore.

09:40.751 --> 09:42.485
There's nowhere to hide.

09:43.621 --> 09:44.821
We need your help.

09:44.855 --> 09:46.990
I'm pushing the
D.O.J. as hard as I can.

09:47.025 --> 09:48.191
Okay, there has to be
something else

09:48.226 --> 09:49.759
you can do in the meantime.

09:49.794 --> 09:51.194
Talk to the Feds,
to-to pressure the local news

09:51.229 --> 09:53.397
to get Vincent's face
off the front page.

09:53.431 --> 09:54.471
Or...
- Witness relocation.

09:57.935 --> 09:58.935
You serious?

10:03.407 --> 10:07.777
Why not? It'll get you
out of the city.

10:07.812 --> 10:10.012
Keep you from being seen
or worse, caught.

10:10.047 --> 10:12.715
Plus... it'd keep you off
the front page for once.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.516
Give me some time
to work the powers that be

10:14.551 --> 10:16.552
without all this heat.

10:16.586 --> 10:17.954
For how long?

10:17.988 --> 10:19.155
However long it takes.

10:19.990 --> 10:20.990
It could be a while.

10:22.459 --> 10:24.460
Look, you'd have to say good-bye

10:24.494 --> 10:25.962
to everything
and everybody, too.

10:25.996 --> 10:28.897
For all intents and
purposes, you'd simply...

10:28.932 --> 10:30.231
vanish.

10:34.437 --> 10:36.204
<i>Did he say where he was</i>
<i>thinking of sending you?</i>

10:36.238 --> 10:37.973
I mean, if it's
the Bahamas or Hawaii,

10:38.007 --> 10:39.608
I say go for it,
but if it's Queens...

10:39.642 --> 10:40.642
It's not either...

10:40.643 --> 10:42.744
We actually can't say.

10:42.779 --> 10:43.779
Just in case anyone asks,

10:43.780 --> 10:45.447
it's better you guys
don't know.

10:45.482 --> 10:47.915
Well, could you at least
give us a clue?

10:47.950 --> 10:49.584
Is it city? Country?

10:49.618 --> 10:50.618
Suburbia.

10:52.154 --> 10:54.089
"Suburbia"? You mean, like,
white picket fences

10:54.123 --> 10:55.457
and Labradoodles?
Stop, it sounds great.

10:55.491 --> 10:57.325
I wish I could go.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.660
What? At least there's
no garbage lining the street.

10:59.695 --> 11:01.562
But they're city people.

11:01.597 --> 11:02.663
We're all city people.

11:02.698 --> 11:03.798
You can't just
leave Manhattan;

11:03.832 --> 11:05.299
you'll get bored.
- That's crap.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.602
Okay, look, we haven't actually
agreed to anything yet.

11:07.636 --> 11:10.104
When do you have to decide by?
- Right away.

11:10.138 --> 11:12.306
Another couple decided
against relocation,

11:12.340 --> 11:13.975
so we'd be taking
over their covers.

11:14.009 --> 11:15.409
Knox would want us to
move in tonight.

11:15.443 --> 11:17.077
- Tonight?
- And the bright side is that

11:17.112 --> 11:18.178
Catherine and I would finally

11:18.213 --> 11:19.679
get a chance to...

11:19.714 --> 11:21.315
well, live this normal life
we've always wanted.

11:21.349 --> 11:22.416
More like the FBI's idea

11:22.450 --> 11:23.850
of a normal life.

11:23.885 --> 11:25.152
It'll get us out of the
spotlight, right?

11:25.186 --> 11:26.753
And who knows?
Maybe the grass

11:26.787 --> 11:28.255
really is greener in suburbia.

11:28.289 --> 11:30.324
Okay, well,
whether it is or not,

11:30.358 --> 11:31.691
it's definitely
too dangerous

11:31.726 --> 11:32.959
for you guys
to be here right now.

11:32.994 --> 11:35.362
I don't think you have
much of a choice.

11:35.397 --> 11:36.530
What about Gabe?
We can't just walk away

11:36.564 --> 11:37.664
and let him
get away with murder--

11:37.698 --> 11:39.165
- again.
- We'll figure out

11:39.199 --> 11:40.600
what Gabe did
with the witness.

11:40.635 --> 11:41.935
We'll just pick up

11:41.969 --> 11:43.136
where you left off, right?
- Yeah.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.370
Uh...
no offense, buddy,

11:44.405 --> 11:45.772
but how are you
gonna just

11:45.806 --> 11:47.440
pick up where...
I left off?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.175
Okay, look,

11:49.209 --> 11:50.610
I may not have beast sense,

11:50.645 --> 11:52.045
but I've got common sense,
all right?

11:52.079 --> 11:53.079
Plus, my girl here's

11:53.080 --> 11:55.048
got a badge
and a gun, so...

11:55.082 --> 11:56.882
have a little faith,
will you?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.051
Okay.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.485
We won't let you down;

11:59.520 --> 12:01.187
we'll get Gabe.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.988
Mostly, because
we know if we don't...

12:03.023 --> 12:04.323
you can't come back and...

12:04.358 --> 12:06.892
that's not gonna
work for any of us.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.194
What he said.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.000
There you go.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.639
Thanks.

12:20.674 --> 12:22.808
Now, which way did you say
that Vincent, um...

12:22.842 --> 12:25.310
the, uh, fugitive, was headed?

12:25.344 --> 12:26.744
I'm not really sure.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.213
Try.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.082
Why does it matter?
It matters, because he is

12:30.116 --> 12:31.683
more than just a fugitive,
he is a murderer.

12:31.717 --> 12:33.985
And the D.A.'s office
has reason to believe

12:34.019 --> 12:35.853
that he is...
tracking his latest victim.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.556
I'm just trying
to figure out

12:37.590 --> 12:39.524
if you knew where
he was going, that's all.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.993
The guy's a real creep, huh?

12:42.027 --> 12:43.494
Yeah. He is.

12:43.528 --> 12:45.663
So, north on Third,
you say?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.264
If I was to guess,

12:47.299 --> 12:48.265
yeah, I think that's where

12:48.300 --> 12:49.734
they were headed.
- They?

12:49.768 --> 12:50.868
Yeah, uh...
him and a

12:50.903 --> 12:52.169
cute little brunette.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.005
Although they split up
after I spotted him.

12:55.373 --> 12:57.709
Thanks.

13:08.753 --> 13:10.053
Catherine?

13:10.088 --> 13:12.323
It's Gabe.
You home?

13:34.445 --> 13:36.078
Is she in some kind of trouble?

13:36.113 --> 13:38.648
No. No. No. Our office is
just trying to get ahold of her.

13:38.682 --> 13:40.402
When was the last time
you saw Ms. Chandler?

13:40.417 --> 13:42.485
Saw her? I don't know,
a couple days ago

13:42.520 --> 13:43.753
in the laundry room,
maybe.

13:43.787 --> 13:45.888
No. She was heading up
to the roof.

13:45.922 --> 13:47.657
She does that a lot.

13:47.691 --> 13:48.758
Must have plants up there
or something.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.627
You're sure
she's not in trouble?

13:51.662 --> 13:52.828
Do me a favor...

13:52.863 --> 13:55.131
if you see her,
give me a call, will you?

13:55.165 --> 13:57.266
It's important I find her.
Sure thing, Gabe.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.934
- But it might not be

13:58.969 --> 14:00.235
for a few weeks.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.504
I'm sorry?
I mean, I haven't seen Cat,

14:02.539 --> 14:05.240
but she called me and left me
a voice mail this morning.

14:05.275 --> 14:06.908
Asked me to pick up her mail
until the end of the month.

14:06.942 --> 14:08.177
Maybe longer.
She wasn't sure.

14:08.211 --> 14:10.011
Did she say where she was going?

14:10.046 --> 14:11.146
Beats me.

14:12.948 --> 14:18.119
♪ Here, in the familiar place

14:18.154 --> 14:20.455
♪ We got our heads down

14:20.490 --> 14:24.625
♪ And then pretend
it's 'cause the night is dark ♪

14:24.660 --> 14:29.864
♪ I'm running out of space

14:29.899 --> 14:32.266
♪ For us to run around

14:32.301 --> 14:35.003
♪ But I said to him
that money's tight... ♪

14:42.244 --> 14:44.579
Are you sure
this is the right address?

14:45.880 --> 14:47.248
Yeah.

14:48.483 --> 14:50.484
It's huge.

14:50.519 --> 14:52.687
Yeah.

14:52.721 --> 14:53.854
What do we do now?

14:56.725 --> 14:57.791
Get out.

15:05.033 --> 15:07.634
That guy
just flipped me off.

15:07.668 --> 15:09.169
Catherine,
he's waving at you,

15:09.204 --> 15:11.838
wave back.

15:11.872 --> 15:13.673
You got to blend in,
remember?

15:13.708 --> 15:14.741
We can't risk
getting exposed.

15:14.775 --> 15:15.908
Okay, I feel like
everyone is

15:15.943 --> 15:17.677
staring at us.

15:17.712 --> 15:19.746
They are staring at us
'cause we just moved in.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.013
It doesn't look
like anyone has

15:22.283 --> 15:23.583
recognized me yet, either,

15:23.618 --> 15:25.017
which is good.
- Still,

15:25.052 --> 15:27.519
I feel like we just parachuted
into Pleasantville, don't you?

15:27.554 --> 15:29.055
I don't know if I can

15:29.089 --> 15:30.823
trust air
that doesn't smell.

15:30.858 --> 15:32.491
You want to go back?

15:32.525 --> 15:34.060
Because we can go back.

15:34.094 --> 15:35.494
I know it is a lot to give up
your life for me.

15:35.528 --> 15:36.829
Give me a break.

15:36.864 --> 15:38.064
Vincent, I love you.

15:38.098 --> 15:40.233
I would give up anything
to be with you.

15:40.267 --> 15:41.333
Even New York?

15:41.368 --> 15:43.069
Are you kidding?!

15:43.103 --> 15:44.436
To get this big,
beautiful house?

15:44.471 --> 15:45.471
It's a dream come true.

15:45.472 --> 15:47.539
It is.

15:47.574 --> 15:49.107
All right,
I believe you.

15:50.209 --> 15:51.410
I do.

15:57.150 --> 15:58.284
Mrs. Vaughn.

15:58.318 --> 16:00.018
Thank you, Mr. Vaughn.

16:02.121 --> 16:03.454
This is weird,
though, isn't it?

16:03.489 --> 16:05.190
Yeah. It really is.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.394
Oh. Okay.

16:10.462 --> 16:12.230
Let's get used to it.

16:20.755 --> 16:23.657
Good news...
I'm not on the front cover...

16:23.692 --> 16:25.893
or on any page,
for that matter.

16:25.927 --> 16:28.127
I guess what happens
in Manhattan stays...

16:28.162 --> 16:29.296
...in Manhattan!

16:29.330 --> 16:30.497
Good.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.998
How'd you sleep?

16:32.032 --> 16:33.099
All right, I guess.
I don't know,

16:33.133 --> 16:34.501
it's really quiet out here.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.968
Mm-hmm.
Well...

16:36.003 --> 16:38.338
the Feds stocked
the fridge at least.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.806
Want me to make you some
breakfast?

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
No, thanks.

16:42.843 --> 16:45.578
Huh?
What are you doing?

16:45.612 --> 16:47.013
Checking crime reports,

16:47.047 --> 16:48.114
reading up on our covers.

16:48.148 --> 16:50.349
Why?
- Why...?

16:50.383 --> 16:51.684
'Cause we need to know

16:51.719 --> 16:53.452
our cover's cold, that's why.
- No, I mean,

16:53.486 --> 16:54.587
why are you checking up

16:54.621 --> 16:56.756
on crime reports...?

16:58.859 --> 17:00.826
Catherine, come on, New York, really?
- What?

17:00.860 --> 17:02.428
I like to stay on top
of things, it's a habit.

17:02.462 --> 17:03.929
No, you like
looking for trouble.

17:03.963 --> 17:06.832
You don't do that anymore,
remember, Mrs. Vaughn?

17:06.866 --> 17:09.034
You're not a cop,
you're a writer.

17:09.068 --> 17:11.670
Yes, I know...
A mystery... novelist.

17:11.704 --> 17:12.804
Okay, I know that, but...

17:12.839 --> 17:14.172
No. No "buts," Catherine, okay?

17:14.207 --> 17:15.973
It's "Veronica," Tim.

17:16.008 --> 17:17.342
Right? See, now...

17:17.376 --> 17:18.542
Mmm...
- ...now we're talking.

17:18.577 --> 17:20.945
Here you go, read the paper, relax.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.047
I...

17:22.080 --> 17:24.682
...am making breakfast.

17:24.717 --> 17:27.152
Okay... fine...
I guess this is gonna be

17:27.185 --> 17:31.857
a little more complicated
than I thought.

17:31.891 --> 17:33.491
Yankees lost.

17:33.525 --> 17:34.892
Catherine!
- What?!

17:34.926 --> 17:36.728
I'm not allowed to
root for the Yankees?

17:36.762 --> 17:38.083
We don't live in
New York anymore.

17:38.096 --> 17:40.030
You are Mrs. Vaughn,
Veronica Vaughn,

17:40.065 --> 17:41.733
from San... Fran...
cisco.

17:41.767 --> 17:43.268
Whatever.

17:44.603 --> 17:45.836
Jeter went out for four.

17:47.339 --> 17:49.940
I give up.
- What?!

17:58.183 --> 17:59.416
Oh, shut up.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.525
Whoa!

18:08.559 --> 18:10.927
- Hey! I'm walking here...!
- Hey.

18:10.961 --> 18:13.330
So, I checked
that corner market's

18:13.364 --> 18:14.731
security cam,
there's no sign

18:14.766 --> 18:16.232
of Gabe's car
driving past.

18:16.267 --> 18:18.402
But, you know, it could be
blocked by a bus or something.

18:18.436 --> 18:19.503
And then I also talked to

18:19.537 --> 18:20.671
a couple of store owners...

18:20.705 --> 18:21.871
nothing.

18:21.906 --> 18:23.106
So I got nothing.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.541
How about you, any luck?
- Nope.

18:27.377 --> 18:28.611
Why the face?

18:28.645 --> 18:30.479
Nothing.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.351
I don't know what
I was thinking, okay.

18:35.385 --> 18:36.920
I thought I could pick up

18:36.954 --> 18:38.387
where Vincent left off.

18:38.422 --> 18:39.855
I wanted to, but...

18:39.889 --> 18:41.609
Wait, you thought you could
do it in the way

18:41.625 --> 18:42.792
Vincent does it?

18:42.826 --> 18:44.694
Of course not. Obviously.

18:44.728 --> 18:46.889
Then, what were you expecting?
I don't know, all right.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.398
I thought something would
occur to me. Anything.

18:49.433 --> 18:50.800
I guess I'm just...

18:50.834 --> 18:52.968
so used to
relying on Vincent

18:53.002 --> 18:54.269
to do
this kind of stuff.

18:54.304 --> 18:56.104
But you're not Vincent.
I don't...

18:56.139 --> 18:57.139
Yes. Thank you...

18:57.140 --> 18:59.274
Tess,
I know that.

18:59.309 --> 19:01.189
So... maybe it's time
to step out of his shadow.

19:01.978 --> 19:04.146
Less Robin, more Batman.

19:04.180 --> 19:05.747
Really?

19:05.781 --> 19:07.216
A comic book analogy?

19:07.250 --> 19:09.218
I'm just saying.

19:09.252 --> 19:10.813
Use that professor brain
of yours, okay?

19:10.820 --> 19:13.154
You've found
people before,

19:13.188 --> 19:14.922
you even found Vincent.

19:14.957 --> 19:17.124
Look around you,
what do <i>you</i> see?

19:17.159 --> 19:18.560
How would <i>you</i> track Gabe?

19:28.604 --> 19:30.671
We'll need you there by 7:00.

19:30.705 --> 19:33.007
Why don't I just come
and meet you?

19:33.041 --> 19:34.608
If you could pick up
two bottles of red.

19:34.642 --> 19:36.110
Yeah, sweetie, I'll just...

19:36.144 --> 19:37.478
Of course I'll go out.

19:37.512 --> 19:39.247
Wait a minute.
- What?

19:44.319 --> 19:46.587
Cell towers...
that's it.

19:49.056 --> 19:50.357
You're a genius.

19:50.392 --> 19:53.093
Oh.

20:00.001 --> 20:01.167
Oh, yeah,
l-let me give you

20:01.202 --> 20:02.202
a hand with that.

20:02.236 --> 20:03.503
Whoops.
I got it.

20:03.537 --> 20:04.537
Oh, thanks.

20:04.538 --> 20:05.972
Yeah.
Just moving in?

20:06.007 --> 20:07.207
Uh, yeah, yeah.

20:07.241 --> 20:08.375
Just, uh...

20:08.409 --> 20:09.409
just yesterday.

20:09.410 --> 20:10.877
From the city?
- No.

20:10.912 --> 20:12.012
N... No, no city.

20:12.046 --> 20:13.046
I mean...
- Oh.

20:13.047 --> 20:14.214
Why-why-why do you ask?

20:14.248 --> 20:15.248
Oh, just 'cause

20:15.249 --> 20:16.216
you're packing light,
is all.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.250
Oh...

20:17.251 --> 20:18.518
uh...
- No kids,

20:18.552 --> 20:19.552
I guess, huh?

20:19.553 --> 20:21.020
No. No.
- Ah.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.622
Uh, well,
not, not yet.

20:22.656 --> 20:23.896
Just, uh, just me and, uh,
- Ah.

20:23.924 --> 20:25.157
well, me and--
me and the wife.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.793
Oh, yeah.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.995
Honey?! Honey?!

20:30.030 --> 20:31.831
Hey.

20:31.865 --> 20:34.133
Visitor.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.200
Hello!

20:35.235 --> 20:36.235
Oh, hi there.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.669
Uh...?
Right. Just, uh,

20:37.703 --> 20:39.504
set it down right there,
that's great.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.176
Frank Harris,
welcome to the 'hood.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.210
Thank you.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.645
Uh... I am Veronica

20:46.679 --> 20:48.280
and you have obviously
already met, um...

20:49.349 --> 20:50.549
Tim.
- Tim.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.983
You know, me and
my wife, April,

20:52.017 --> 20:53.184
live right across
the street.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.219
Yep, it's been
15 years now.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.422
15 years, wow...

20:57.457 --> 21:00.024
that's, that's... something.
- Yeah.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.326
Just sent a son
off to college.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.360
NYU.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.528
Ah, New York.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.996
Nice.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.064
Yeah, bright lights,
big city.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.499
That's what he wanted.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.766
But not for me, though,
I like it here.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.768
It's friendly...
<i>and</i> safe.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.103
Safe...

21:12.137 --> 21:13.404
is good.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.006
Frank?

21:15.040 --> 21:16.841
Oh, uh, I-I'm sorry,

21:16.875 --> 21:17.875
I didn't mean to...

21:17.909 --> 21:19.043
No. That's okay.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.211
We were just saying hello.

21:20.245 --> 21:21.446
This is my wife, April.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.880
Meet Veronica... and Tim.
- Hi.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.282
Hi. Welcome.
Pleasure.

21:24.316 --> 21:25.349
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:25.383 --> 21:26.584
Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.085
I'm sorry,

21:28.119 --> 21:29.920
but have...

21:29.955 --> 21:31.054
have we met before?

21:31.089 --> 21:32.289
Oh, no.

21:32.323 --> 21:34.291
I... don't think so.

21:34.325 --> 21:35.593
Why?
- Why?

21:36.728 --> 21:39.029
Uh... don't mind April.

21:39.063 --> 21:40.464
We're both just
a little jumpy,

21:40.499 --> 21:42.065
ever since our
jewelry store got robbed

21:42.100 --> 21:43.200
a couple of months ago.

21:43.234 --> 21:45.102
Robbed?
- Yeah.

21:45.136 --> 21:46.336
I thought you said
it was safe?

21:46.337 --> 21:48.238
It is safe.

21:48.272 --> 21:50.140
And you don't have to
apologize for me, honey.

21:50.174 --> 21:51.641
I was just asking.

21:51.675 --> 21:54.411
A-Anyway.

21:54.445 --> 21:55.445
We'll let you
get settled.

21:55.446 --> 21:56.613
Like I said, we're right
across the street

21:56.647 --> 21:58.648
if you need anything.

21:58.682 --> 21:59.749
Great. Thank you.
We appreciate it.

21:59.783 --> 22:01.083
Thanks, bye!
- Uh-huh!

22:01.118 --> 22:02.251
See you soon!
Okay. - Yup.

22:04.587 --> 22:05.954
Maybe we shouldn't unpack.

22:05.989 --> 22:07.956
You know, I don't think
she recognized you.

22:07.991 --> 22:09.591
Really? Then, what was that?

22:09.626 --> 22:11.293
Suburbia.

22:35.117 --> 22:36.984
Whoa!

22:37.019 --> 22:38.119
What am I looking at?

22:38.154 --> 22:40.522
A road map.

22:40.556 --> 22:43.591
Uh, more specifically,
a cell phone road map.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.693
Gabe's cell phone.
Now, all phones

22:45.727 --> 22:47.929
communicate wirelessly
with the nearest tower,

22:47.963 --> 22:51.165
then get handed off to the next
as we travel, right?

22:51.199 --> 22:53.434
When you're making a call.
No, but even when we're not.

22:53.468 --> 22:54.501
If your cell's turned on,

22:54.536 --> 22:56.437
it's always communicating

22:56.471 --> 22:57.471
with the nearest tower,

22:57.472 --> 22:58.773
just like Gabe's was.

22:58.807 --> 23:00.207
Well, why wouldn't
he turn it off?

23:00.241 --> 23:02.009
Who turns off their cell phones?
Nobody.

23:02.044 --> 23:03.044
And...

23:03.045 --> 23:05.212
lucky for us, neither did Gabe.

23:05.246 --> 23:06.681
Now, since Manhattan

23:06.715 --> 23:09.316
has such high mobile traffic,

23:09.350 --> 23:10.817
it requires an extensive
number of towers.

23:10.851 --> 23:12.886
That's what the push
pins represent.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.321
Which means I was able to track

23:14.355 --> 23:15.355
which ones Gabe's cell was

23:15.390 --> 23:16.723
handing its signal off to

23:16.757 --> 23:19.359
while he drove past
where Vincent tracked him.

23:19.394 --> 23:20.860
So, north on Third.

23:20.895 --> 23:22.062
Right.

23:22.097 --> 23:23.564
Then left

23:23.598 --> 23:25.331
on 97th

23:25.365 --> 23:26.800
and up

23:26.834 --> 23:28.201
to the Heights.

23:28.235 --> 23:29.903
To the dungeon.

23:29.937 --> 23:31.404
The dungeon where

23:31.438 --> 23:33.807
we once found human remains

23:33.841 --> 23:35.008
in a crematorium.

23:35.042 --> 23:36.810
W-W-Wait, are you suggesting

23:36.844 --> 23:38.578
that's what Gabe did with
the witness? He burned him?

23:38.613 --> 23:40.580
You know of a better way
to dispose of a body?

23:40.614 --> 23:42.815
That's sick.

23:42.849 --> 23:44.917
No wrath like that
of a lover scorned.

23:44.951 --> 23:47.420
You did it, JT.

23:47.454 --> 23:48.488
You tracked him.

23:48.522 --> 23:49.522
Your way.

23:49.556 --> 23:51.690
Piece of cake...

23:51.725 --> 23:53.226
ish.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.827
Now, let's go find proof on Gabe

23:54.861 --> 23:56.496
so Cat and Vincent
can come back home.

23:58.732 --> 24:00.165
Well, it's going
to be a beautiful

24:00.199 --> 24:01.767
sunny day today,
and we can expect

24:01.801 --> 24:03.441
much more of the same
over the next few...

24:03.469 --> 24:04.737
Post-coitus, the female

24:04.771 --> 24:05.838
averages...

24:07.807 --> 24:10.208
Dumps it out, but down the ice.

24:10.243 --> 24:11.877
Phillips picks it up
and he starts up with it.

24:11.911 --> 24:13.378
He's pinched up
at the side boards,

24:13.412 --> 24:15.547
but manages to get
the puck out...

24:32.831 --> 24:35.099
Catherine? Catherine?

24:35.134 --> 24:36.267
What?

24:36.301 --> 24:37.769
Cops.

24:39.604 --> 24:42.073
Look, that's a cop.

24:42.107 --> 24:43.808
Not cops. He's not
even looking at us.

24:43.842 --> 24:46.144
He was looking at me before.

24:46.178 --> 24:48.979
Okay? And he's driven past,
like, three times tonight.

24:49.013 --> 24:50.947
Okay, who's looking
for trouble now?

24:50.982 --> 24:52.550
Why don't you just help me
with the dishes?

24:52.584 --> 24:54.285
If I'm gonna be Barbie,
you could at least be Ken.

24:54.319 --> 24:55.486
Okay, well, if he's
not looking for me,

24:55.520 --> 24:56.787
then who is he looking for?

24:56.821 --> 24:58.455
Especially at this time
of night, right?

24:58.490 --> 24:59.956
Don't ask me.

24:59.991 --> 25:02.560
I'm just a mystery writer.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.805
Are you hearing gunshots?

25:14.839 --> 25:16.573
Oh, my...
What's going on over here?

25:16.607 --> 25:17.908
I-I think I heard gunshots, too.

25:17.942 --> 25:19.609
Come on!

25:19.643 --> 25:22.011
Catherine!

25:22.045 --> 25:24.180
Shooting
at 1476 South Maple Street!

25:24.215 --> 25:26.148
What happened?
Stand back!

25:26.183 --> 25:27.684
Request ambulance on scene.

25:27.718 --> 25:30.253
Code 3, victim is coding.
Over. Repeat.

25:30.287 --> 25:32.355
Victim is coding!
You killed him!

25:32.389 --> 25:34.490
You killed my husband!
Stay away!

25:55.245 --> 25:57.280
What? You couldn't sleep?

25:57.314 --> 25:58.647
No.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.482
Aw, are they still out there?

26:00.517 --> 26:02.651
Where's April?

26:02.686 --> 26:04.186
Who?

26:04.220 --> 26:06.488
Mrs. Harris,
the victim's wife.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.723
She's not outside
with her husband.

26:07.757 --> 26:09.191
Catherine, he's dead.

26:09.225 --> 26:10.392
Right, but normally
you have to pry

26:10.427 --> 26:11.993
the grieving widow
away from the body.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.562
She wanted to go back inside.

26:14.664 --> 26:16.465
Do you want a refill?

26:16.499 --> 26:18.099
Yeah.

26:20.002 --> 26:22.070
Wait.

26:22.104 --> 26:23.538
How did you know that

26:23.572 --> 26:25.207
she wanted to go back inside?

26:25.241 --> 26:26.741
I, uh,

26:26.775 --> 26:29.577
I overheard her talking
to the detective.

26:29.611 --> 26:32.214
Uh, not from inside
here, you didn't.

26:32.248 --> 26:34.349
No, I was, I was over there.

26:34.383 --> 26:36.017
But only for a minute or two.
Come on!

26:36.052 --> 26:38.553
Are you out of your mind?
Don't worry! I blended in.

26:38.587 --> 26:40.638
According to them, I'm just
another nosy neighbor.

26:40.639 --> 26:41.955
What if they figure
out you're a cop?

26:41.957 --> 26:42.957
They won't!

26:42.958 --> 26:44.091
Why would they?

26:44.125 --> 26:45.259
There's just

26:45.293 --> 26:46.453
something about this shooting

26:46.462 --> 26:47.495
that doesn't add up.

26:47.529 --> 26:48.596
See? Cop!

26:48.630 --> 26:50.097
Mystery writer.

26:50.131 --> 26:52.400
What am I supposed to do?
Just ignore my instincts?

26:52.434 --> 26:54.001
Yes, that is exactly what
you're supposed to do.

26:54.035 --> 26:55.102
Ignore your instincts

26:55.136 --> 26:56.937
so you don't blow our cover.

26:56.972 --> 26:58.906
Well, I'm sorry I can't do that.

27:00.108 --> 27:02.943
Veronica has a few questions.

27:02.978 --> 27:03.978
Catherine?

27:03.979 --> 27:06.580
V-Veronica, uh...

27:06.614 --> 27:08.548
Damn it!

27:11.151 --> 27:12.252
The victim fired first?

27:12.286 --> 27:13.920
Yeah, twice.

27:13.954 --> 27:16.055
He must've thought I was
gonna rob him or something.

27:16.090 --> 27:18.057
Well, he had a permit to carry.

27:18.092 --> 27:19.693
His wife had reported
a suspicious vehicle

27:19.727 --> 27:20.861
in the area recently...

27:20.895 --> 27:22.362
Yeah, I know.
She told me.

27:22.397 --> 27:23.897
That's why I was
doing extra patrols.

27:23.931 --> 27:25.632
I met the Harrises when

27:25.666 --> 27:26.766
their jewelry store got hit.
Mrs. Harris called me

27:26.800 --> 27:28.401
a couple of times,
said she was afraid

27:28.435 --> 27:29.402
it was gonna
happen again, so...

27:29.436 --> 27:31.271
Wait, she called you personally?

27:32.672 --> 27:34.908
Sorry, sorry.

27:36.410 --> 27:38.130
So, you were on patrol?
Yeah, and then I saw

27:38.145 --> 27:39.478
someone jump over their fence.

27:39.513 --> 27:42.048
I announced myself,
but Mr. Harris

27:42.082 --> 27:43.582
obviously didn't hear me.

27:43.617 --> 27:45.451
Why would he climb
over his own fence?

27:45.485 --> 27:47.486
I'm sorry, who are you?

27:47.521 --> 27:49.288
Nosy neighbor.

27:49.322 --> 27:50.923
Why wouldn't he just go in the
front door, ring the doorbell?

27:50.957 --> 27:52.892
Where was his wife?

27:52.926 --> 27:53.926
I don't know.

27:53.927 --> 27:54.927
Okay, so you just happened

27:54.961 --> 27:56.562
to be on patrol when Mr. Harris

27:56.596 --> 27:58.297
was climbing over his fence?
And why wasn't

27:58.331 --> 28:00.732
the motion sensor working?
You know they've got one, right?

28:00.766 --> 28:02.134
Look, ma'am, I'm afraid

28:02.168 --> 28:04.169
I'm gonna have
to ask you to step back.

28:04.203 --> 28:05.971
- Yeah, but...
- Honey!

28:06.005 --> 28:07.505
Hey, we got to go.

28:07.540 --> 28:09.408
We're so late.
No, we don't.

28:09.442 --> 28:11.410
Yes, we do.
Church meeting

28:11.444 --> 28:13.312
with the pastor. Come on.

28:13.346 --> 28:16.047
You were saying?

28:18.651 --> 28:20.117
What are you doing?

28:20.152 --> 28:21.953
That shooting?
It wasn't an accident, Vincent.

28:21.987 --> 28:23.387
I think she set him up.
Catherine...

28:23.388 --> 28:24.856
Ten bucks says Mrs. Harris

28:24.890 --> 28:26.791
called Deputy Lewis to
come by on his patrol

28:26.826 --> 28:28.359
right at the moment her husband
was coming home.

28:28.393 --> 28:29.103
Oh, come on.

28:29.127 --> 28:31.275
And she conveniently
took his house keys.

28:31.564 --> 28:33.030
So he would have to
climb over that fence.

28:33.065 --> 28:34.531
And she knew that he was armed.

28:34.566 --> 28:36.633
And probably jittery,
having just been robbed.

28:36.668 --> 28:38.135
Just stop. Okay? Stop.

28:38.170 --> 28:39.203
You don't know any of this.

28:39.237 --> 28:40.804
No, I know

28:40.839 --> 28:43.040
that April didn't
like Frank.

28:43.075 --> 28:44.976
That is motive.

28:45.010 --> 28:46.863
From the one comment
she made in front of us?

28:46.887 --> 28:47.678
Yeah!

28:47.679 --> 28:49.513
And the fact that she's probably
sitting in her living room

28:49.547 --> 28:51.147
right now enjoying a cocktail
while her husband

28:51.182 --> 28:52.850
gets carted off to the morgue.

28:52.884 --> 28:55.485
Right, so you've been away
from the city for one whole day,

28:55.519 --> 28:57.854
and now all of a sudden you've
come up with some elaborate

28:57.888 --> 28:59.121
murder plot
right across the street?

28:59.155 --> 29:00.155
Already?

29:00.190 --> 29:02.124
Maybe.
- No.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.293
Maybe you're trying
to find a way

29:04.327 --> 29:05.394
to sabotage this whole thing

29:05.428 --> 29:06.496
to expose us.

29:06.530 --> 29:08.030
That is crazy.
Yeah, it is.

29:08.064 --> 29:10.366
Because I am a wanted man.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.901
And even if there is something
going on across the street,

29:12.935 --> 29:14.569
we can't get involved, okay?

29:14.604 --> 29:15.804
Or I am screwed.
- No, we have

29:15.838 --> 29:16.872
to get involved.

29:16.906 --> 29:18.140
It's called justice.

29:18.174 --> 29:19.375
If we don't, then,

29:19.409 --> 29:20.509
then what are we, Vincent?

29:20.543 --> 29:21.576
We're just two people on the run

29:21.611 --> 29:22.911
who only care about ourselves.

29:22.945 --> 29:24.713
And that's never
gonna work for me.

29:24.747 --> 29:28.049
And I know damn well that it
doesn't work for you, either.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.532
Well, this is creepy.

29:44.566 --> 29:45.699
Yeah, I know.

29:45.734 --> 29:48.602
What-what are
we even looking for?

29:48.637 --> 29:51.572
Fresh...

29:51.606 --> 29:53.374
bones.

29:53.409 --> 29:55.510
Bones? I thought cremations

29:55.544 --> 29:56.677
turned everything to ashes?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.712
Yeah, well, not necessarily.

29:58.747 --> 30:00.114
Uh, certified crematoriums

30:00.149 --> 30:01.749
only vaporize the body.

30:01.783 --> 30:04.451
Then what's left is
run through a pulverizer.

30:04.485 --> 30:05.920
That's how it becomes ashes.

30:05.954 --> 30:07.888
Lovely.

30:09.958 --> 30:13.326
But since this is
hardly certified...

30:16.765 --> 30:18.598
Bingo.
- Think it could be Watson?

30:18.632 --> 30:20.767
A simple DNA test will tell.

30:20.801 --> 30:22.835
That won't be necessary.

30:25.339 --> 30:26.873
Where's Vincent?

30:33.768 --> 30:35.604
Put the gun down
and will talk about this.

30:35.845 --> 30:37.380
"Talk"?
What's there to "talk" about?

30:37.414 --> 30:38.514
We all know why we're here.

30:38.548 --> 30:39.815
Gabe, what's happened to you?

30:39.849 --> 30:42.385
What has happened to me?

30:42.419 --> 30:44.653
You're the ones who are
trying to protect a beast!

30:44.687 --> 30:46.221
I'm trying to protect Catherine.

30:46.256 --> 30:48.824
Wait, so you think you're
actually in the right here?

30:48.858 --> 30:51.160
I am in the right.

30:51.194 --> 30:53.528
Gabe, you killed a man.
- So did Vincent. Why aren't you after him?

30:53.562 --> 30:56.431
Vincent only killed because he
had to, not to cover his ass.

30:56.465 --> 30:57.699
But he will
kill again.

30:57.733 --> 30:59.034
Beasts only
get worse.

30:59.068 --> 31:00.702
Just like Reynolds said.

31:01.804 --> 31:03.905
It's why he has to be stopped.

31:03.939 --> 31:06.240
By who? You?
Who else? I'm the only one

31:06.275 --> 31:07.175
who can
do it.

31:07.209 --> 31:08.209
And I
have to.

31:08.243 --> 31:10.111
For Catherine.

31:10.145 --> 31:11.212
Are you kidding?

31:11.246 --> 31:12.180
She's the one

31:12.214 --> 31:13.080
who sent us after you!

31:13.115 --> 31:14.115
Easy!

31:14.149 --> 31:15.450
Listen.

31:15.484 --> 31:17.018
Gabe, don't
do this.

31:17.052 --> 31:18.786
Okay, we know that you
killed Ray Sheckman

31:18.821 --> 31:20.855
and we can prove that
you killed the witness, too.

31:20.889 --> 31:22.756
Not if I don't let
you out of here.

31:22.791 --> 31:24.358
So, what, you're going
to shoot us, Gabe?

31:24.392 --> 31:25.293
Really?

31:25.327 --> 31:26.627
You can justify that,

31:26.661 --> 31:27.895
can't you,

31:27.930 --> 31:29.596
in your warped zeal
to protect Cat?

31:29.631 --> 31:31.032
JT!

31:31.066 --> 31:32.533
Do you really
think this

31:32.567 --> 31:34.368
will win her back?
Are you that far gone?

31:37.739 --> 31:38.939
I will expose us all.

31:38.973 --> 31:40.307
Excuse me?

31:40.342 --> 31:41.442
The only way
to prove

31:41.476 --> 31:42.876
I did anything

31:42.910 --> 31:44.878
is to open up this dungeon
to the cops,

31:44.912 --> 31:47.247
to everybody.
Which means it's only

31:47.281 --> 31:48.716
a matter of time before
forensics discovers

31:48.750 --> 31:49.983
all the
buried bodies,

31:50.017 --> 31:51.818
your fingerprints, Vincent's,

31:51.853 --> 31:53.486
cross-species DNA

31:53.520 --> 31:55.655
and beasts.

31:55.689 --> 31:56.890
You're bluffing.

31:56.924 --> 31:57.790
Am I?

31:57.825 --> 31:59.792
Then pull the trigger!

31:59.827 --> 32:01.962
See what
happens.

32:01.996 --> 32:03.563
Either way,

32:03.597 --> 32:04.931
I am taking Vincent down.

32:28.788 --> 32:29.989
Deputy Lewis?

32:30.023 --> 32:31.156
Yeah.

32:31.191 --> 32:32.424
Remember me?

32:32.458 --> 32:33.792
Nosy neighbor?

32:33.826 --> 32:35.361
Sure, I
remember.

32:35.395 --> 32:36.795
Listen, I gotta get back
out on patrol, so...

32:36.829 --> 32:39.163
Yeah. I'll just
walk with you.

32:39.198 --> 32:41.332
A lot of
debriefing, right?

32:41.367 --> 32:42.768
Especially with an
officer involved?

32:42.802 --> 32:44.603
Yeah, a ton of
paperwork, too,

32:44.637 --> 32:45.837
and interviews.

32:45.872 --> 32:47.138
Are they gonna
interview Mrs. Harris?

32:47.172 --> 32:48.440
Mrs. Harris?

32:48.474 --> 32:50.776
I don't know.
Why?

32:52.512 --> 32:53.812
Is there somewhere we
can talk in private?

32:53.846 --> 32:55.167
There's something
you need to know

32:55.180 --> 32:56.180
about the shooting.

32:57.883 --> 32:59.450
"Justice."

32:59.484 --> 33:00.985
Ha, what about <i>my</i> justice?

33:01.020 --> 33:02.553
Like I don't even count anymore.

33:02.587 --> 33:05.290
It's not my fault
everybody's after me.

33:05.324 --> 33:07.358
It's not like
I did anything wrong.

33:07.393 --> 33:10.661
You know, I didn't even
want to leave the city.

33:10.695 --> 33:12.463
She is the one
that wanted normal.

33:12.497 --> 33:14.532
Ah, she can't even
handle normal.

33:27.111 --> 33:29.179
Damn it, Catherine.

33:30.748 --> 33:32.549
Oh, yeah, that'll be so fun.

33:32.583 --> 33:35.218
Hi.
- Uh...

33:35.253 --> 33:37.220
I gotta call you back.
Sorry to bother you.

33:37.255 --> 33:39.356
This is completely
out of curiosity,

33:39.390 --> 33:41.124
but did you have
your husband killed?

33:42.893 --> 33:45.361
What?
- Sorry. Yes or no?

33:45.395 --> 33:46.863
No.

33:53.537 --> 33:55.271
Huh.

33:55.305 --> 33:57.306
I hate it when she's right.

33:59.042 --> 34:00.242
<i>If I'm right,</i>

34:00.277 --> 34:01.377
it means you were set up,

34:01.411 --> 34:02.511
which makes this a murder.

34:02.545 --> 34:03.612
Murder?

34:03.646 --> 34:04.913
For Mrs. Harris, not you.

34:04.948 --> 34:06.515
She just used you
to pull the trigger.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.018
You seem to
know a lot

34:09.052 --> 34:10.786
about this stuff.
You a cop?

34:10.820 --> 34:12.088
No, no.

34:12.121 --> 34:13.356
No, I'm just a...

34:13.389 --> 34:14.755
a mystery writer.

34:16.592 --> 34:18.793
I don't know. It's
pretty hard to believe.

34:18.828 --> 34:21.196
I mean, isn't there an easier
way to kill your husband?

34:21.230 --> 34:22.630
And get away with it?

34:22.665 --> 34:23.899
Not really.

34:23.933 --> 34:25.601
She called you,
right?

34:25.635 --> 34:27.603
She asked you to come over?
- Yeah.

34:27.637 --> 34:28.871
Right when
her husband

34:28.905 --> 34:30.105
was coming
home from work.

34:30.139 --> 34:31.473
She made sure that

34:31.507 --> 34:32.741
he didn't have a key,
it was dark,

34:32.775 --> 34:34.574
he had a gun...
She even had the TV

34:34.610 --> 34:37.212
turned up really loud
so he didn't hear you call out.

34:37.246 --> 34:38.880
Why would she even
want him killed, though?

34:38.914 --> 34:40.547
They were married forever.

34:40.581 --> 34:42.617
Maybe suburbia isn't
as perfect as it looks.

34:44.753 --> 34:46.554
I mean, who knows?

34:46.588 --> 34:48.422
Life insurance, abuse,

34:48.456 --> 34:50.425
infidelity...

34:50.458 --> 34:52.579
She obviously wasn't getting
along with him very well.

34:52.594 --> 34:54.594
How do you know?
You only met her yesterday.

34:56.164 --> 34:57.498
How do you know when I met her?

34:57.533 --> 35:00.100
I... I don't know.

35:00.135 --> 35:02.469
I guess Mrs. Harris
must've told me or something.

35:02.504 --> 35:04.772
Why would she tell you that?

35:04.806 --> 35:07.141
And when did she tell you that?

35:11.679 --> 35:13.080
You're not wearing your vest.

35:13.114 --> 35:15.849
No, I don't wear one on patrol.

35:15.883 --> 35:18.252
But you were wearing
one last night,

35:18.286 --> 35:20.454
almost as if

35:20.488 --> 35:22.089
you knew you might get shot at.

37:17.870 --> 37:19.170
What are
you doing here?

37:19.204 --> 37:20.705
Saving you.

37:20.740 --> 37:22.606
Wait, how did you find me?
I, uh...

37:22.641 --> 37:23.874
I... I tracked you.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.043
But what
made you

37:25.077 --> 37:26.610
decide to do that?

37:26.645 --> 37:28.346
Mrs. Harris.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.613
She confessed.
- She did?

37:29.648 --> 37:30.515
Why?

37:30.549 --> 37:32.517
Well...

37:32.551 --> 37:34.618
I finally figured out
that you were right.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.255
Probably going to the cops
with it, which you did....

37:37.289 --> 37:40.090
When'd you realize she
was sleeping with him?

37:40.124 --> 37:41.926
Right before
he tried to kill me.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.627
Huh.

37:43.662 --> 37:44.895
You okay?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.463
Yeah,
I'm okay.

37:46.497 --> 37:48.098
But I'm gonna
have to testify,

37:48.132 --> 37:51.201
which means I'm pretty sure
I blew our cover.

37:51.235 --> 37:52.302
Huh.

37:52.336 --> 37:53.403
Are you mad?

37:53.438 --> 37:55.638
No.

37:55.673 --> 37:56.739
No, I'm not.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.075
But Knox will be.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.576
You know, he made
it pretty clear

37:59.610 --> 38:00.910
if things didn't
work out here,

38:00.945 --> 38:02.579
he might not be able
to clear my name.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.214
We did the right thing,
Vincent.

38:04.248 --> 38:05.882
We couldn't walk away
and just let somebody

38:05.916 --> 38:07.484
get away with murder. It's not

38:07.518 --> 38:09.219
who we are.
- I know.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.221
Come here...

38:16.493 --> 38:18.661
Can we go home now?

38:21.164 --> 38:23.967

JT?

38:37.780 --> 38:39.115
Over here.

38:39.149 --> 38:42.451
What, you don't answer
your phone anymore?

38:42.486 --> 38:44.453
Not when I'm sulking, no.

38:44.488 --> 38:47.022
Okay. You know, Vincent's
been trying to call you.

38:47.056 --> 38:50.692
Vincent what? I-Is he all right?
Yeah, sort of.

38:50.727 --> 38:51.960
They're actually
back in town.

38:51.995 --> 38:53.528
Apparently,

38:53.562 --> 38:54.529
it didn't work out,
wherever they went.

38:54.563 --> 38:55.797
Why? What happened?

38:55.832 --> 38:56.832
Well, it's a long story,

38:56.833 --> 38:58.700
but I gather the short of it

38:58.735 --> 39:00.869
is you can take the girl
out of the city,

39:00.903 --> 39:02.504
but you can't take the city
out of the girl.

39:02.538 --> 39:04.606
Plus, they were
getting shot at, so...

39:04.640 --> 39:07.008
They can't go
anywhere, those two.

39:07.042 --> 39:09.444
So what are
they gonna do?

39:09.478 --> 39:11.312
Stay and fight, I guess.

39:11.347 --> 39:13.114
I just hope Agent Knox
comes through

39:13.149 --> 39:15.283
with that exoneration
before Gabe outs Vincent.

39:15.317 --> 39:18.853
Speaking of, did you tell 'em
I screwed up?

39:18.887 --> 39:20.621
How'd you screw up?

39:20.656 --> 39:22.523
Gabe.

39:22.557 --> 39:25.392
Not making it safe for
Vincent to come back. Hello?

39:25.426 --> 39:27.028
But that's not
what you said you'd do.

39:27.062 --> 39:28.796
You said you'd pick up
where Vincent left off,

39:28.830 --> 39:30.164
and you did that.

39:30.198 --> 39:32.867
You found out where Gabe
took the body, right?

39:32.901 --> 39:34.334
You did good.

39:34.369 --> 39:36.303
I did, didn't I?

39:36.337 --> 39:37.571
Yeah.

39:37.605 --> 39:39.005
It's not your fault
that he threatened

39:39.040 --> 39:40.840
beast exposure.
- True.

39:40.875 --> 39:42.176
Besides, you stood up to Gabe,

39:42.210 --> 39:43.690
even when he had a gun
pointed at you.

39:44.845 --> 39:46.547
It's very Batman.

39:46.581 --> 39:49.316
Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

39:49.350 --> 39:50.551
Yeah.

39:55.255 --> 39:57.390
Now give me a gummy.

40:01.562 --> 40:03.262
No, I like red, actually.

40:03.297 --> 40:05.198
Oh, my God.

40:05.232 --> 40:08.100
There you go. Red and green.
Thank you.

40:18.812 --> 40:21.581
So much for it being
greener in suburbia, huh?

40:21.615 --> 40:23.216
Well, if we never
would've tried,

40:23.250 --> 40:24.717
we never
would've known, right?

40:24.751 --> 40:26.719
Come on. It wasn't that bad.
And who knows,

40:26.753 --> 40:29.922
maybe one day
we can try it again.

40:29.956 --> 40:31.423
Maybe.

40:31.457 --> 40:33.425
Maybe. But not by
running and hiding.

40:33.459 --> 40:35.427
I don't think that's
ever really the answer.

40:35.451 --> 40:36.228

40:43.236 --> 40:45.903
But on the bright side,
I mean,

40:45.938 --> 40:47.372
one thing
I have learned is that

40:47.406 --> 40:49.107
wherever we end up, you...

40:49.141 --> 40:50.642
got to keep kicking ass.

40:52.245 --> 40:53.245
Oh, yes, it is.

40:53.246 --> 40:54.479
- It's okay.

40:54.513 --> 40:55.747
It's who I fell in love with.

40:55.781 --> 40:57.248
