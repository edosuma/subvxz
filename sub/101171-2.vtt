00:11.172 --> 00:15.379
all:

00:29.827 --> 00:31.413
- Make a wish, Jakey boy.

00:37.551 --> 00:40.206
- I wish you could stay our
perfect little boy forever.

00:40.275 --> 00:42.068
- Good night,
Super Bowl champ.

00:42.137 --> 00:43.758
You're my favorite sports boy.

00:43.827 --> 00:45.862
Go, Giants.
- Good night, Dad.

00:45.931 --> 00:47.206
Go, Giants.

00:49.689 --> 00:51.000
- Do you think
he has pubes yet?

00:51.068 --> 00:52.068
- I don't think so.

00:57.413 --> 00:59.758
- Happy birthday, Jake.

01:01.275 --> 01:03.310
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not here to hurt you.

01:03.379 --> 01:06.344
I'm actually here to give you
one more birthday gift--

01:06.413 --> 01:08.827
the truth about life.

01:08.896 --> 01:11.965
Well, your parents like
to tell you that life is good

01:12.034 --> 01:13.793
and that you're worthy of love.

01:13.862 --> 01:16.965
But your parents
are lying liars.

01:17.034 --> 01:20.000
Remember when they told
you Santa Claus was real?

01:20.068 --> 01:22.827
That was extra fucked up
because you're Jewish.

01:22.896 --> 01:24.655
I'm Jewish, too.

01:24.724 --> 01:29.137
Anyway, I'm here to tell you
that life is fundamentally bad.

01:29.206 --> 01:30.827
But don't let that
get you down.

01:30.896 --> 01:32.689
I'm your new best friend,

01:32.758 --> 01:35.137
and I'll be with you
the rest of your life

01:35.206 --> 01:37.827
till the day you die,
Sports Boy.

01:37.896 --> 01:41.758
Oh, and by the way,
you suck at sports.

01:41.827 --> 01:43.862
- Oh, well,

01:43.931 --> 01:46.137
thanks for telling me,
Black Dog.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.482
- No problem, buddy.
Have a good night.

01:48.551 --> 01:50.000
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.758
You have insomnia now,

01:51.827 --> 01:55.413
so it will actually be
a pretty bad night.

02:03.034 --> 02:06.275
- You know, a 30-minute
workout is just 2% of your day.

02:06.344 --> 02:08.068
- You can't possibly think

02:08.137 --> 02:10.000
you're gonna convince me
to go to the gym during lunch.

02:10.068 --> 02:12.172
Come on, you could lose weight.

02:12.241 --> 02:14.241
I lost seven pounds
in six weeks.

02:14.310 --> 02:17.103
At this rate, I'll lose
more pounds in more weeks.

02:17.172 --> 02:20.206
- Thanks, but I actually lost
a bunch of weight recently.

02:20.275 --> 02:21.586
My belt stopped fitting
around my neck

02:21.655 --> 02:23.137
the same way
that it used to.

02:23.206 --> 02:26.793
- Well, for the record, I tried
to help you feel better.

02:26.862 --> 02:29.793
- Was that a suicide joke
or a masturbation joke?

02:29.862 --> 02:31.862
- What's the difference?
We're all gonna die.

02:31.931 --> 02:34.068
- Attaboy!

03:18.379 --> 03:20.862
- I'm proud of myself.

03:20.931 --> 03:22.931
I finally got you
to come to the gym.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.689
- It had nothing to do
with you.

03:24.758 --> 03:27.448
Getting swole has been
in my calendar forever.

03:27.517 --> 03:29.310
- Now I've just got to convince
Jake to come.

03:29.379 --> 03:31.172
- Ugh. If you really want
to help Jake,

03:31.241 --> 03:32.655
convince him to go on meds.

03:32.724 --> 03:34.793
I've been trying for years.

03:34.862 --> 03:36.689
- You think Jake should be
on meds?

03:36.758 --> 03:40.034
- He jokes about killing
himself ten times a day.

03:40.103 --> 03:42.758
Don't you ever worry
about him?

03:42.827 --> 03:45.793
- There was this one time when
Jake was late to pick me up.

03:45.862 --> 03:47.758
You know how
he's always on time.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.689
Well, he was five minutes late,

03:49.758 --> 03:51.655
and I immediately assumed
he'd killed himself.

03:51.724 --> 03:53.758
I imagined myself
at his funeral.

03:53.827 --> 03:56.724
And I gave
a pretty good eulogy.

03:56.793 --> 03:58.827
It could make you laugh,
it could make you cry.

03:58.896 --> 04:01.448
By the time he showed up,
I was genuinely disappointed.

04:01.517 --> 04:02.931
'cause it was some
of the best writing

04:03.000 --> 04:04.275
I've ever done in my life.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.068
I got back into
creative writing after that.

04:06.137 --> 04:08.068
I wrote a couple short
stories, half a novella.

04:08.137 --> 04:10.068
If you wanted to read them,
I could email them to you.

04:10.137 --> 04:13.034
- Matt, do not send me
your short stories.

04:13.103 --> 04:15.034
- I'll send 'em over.

04:15.103 --> 04:18.344
- It has come to our attention
that our logo bears

04:18.413 --> 04:22.724
a slight resemblance to an evil
company's logo in a video game.

04:22.793 --> 04:25.241
- Yeah, personally,
I don't see it.

04:25.310 --> 04:28.034
But the gamer community wants
all of our heads on sticks.

04:28.103 --> 04:31.172
- So our goal now is to
redirect gamers' hatred

04:31.241 --> 04:33.275
away from us
and back towards women.

04:33.344 --> 04:34.827
- Just as God intended.

04:34.896 --> 04:38.896
- Christian wants us to explore
the idea of a new logo.

04:38.965 --> 04:40.068
- Yeah.

04:40.137 --> 04:41.655
- Every logo begins
with a shape.

04:41.724 --> 04:43.482
So let's look at some shapes

04:43.551 --> 04:46.689
and just do
a little free association.

04:46.758 --> 04:48.827
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay? All right.

04:48.896 --> 04:50.620
How about a cylinder?
- Cylinder!

04:50.689 --> 04:52.172
Uh, Pringles.

04:52.241 --> 04:53.965
Uh, once you pop,
the fun don't stop.

04:54.034 --> 04:56.000
Uh, bop it,
twist it...

04:56.068 --> 04:57.793
- A metal pipe
to bludgeon myself with

04:57.862 --> 04:59.551
so I can get out
of this meeting.

04:59.620 --> 05:01.172
- Right round, baby,
right round.

05:01.241 --> 05:03.275
- How about a rectangle?
- Rectangle.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.448
Uh, a door.

05:04.517 --> 05:06.758
Uh, uh--no, no, no.
The Doors!

05:06.827 --> 05:08.931
- The coffin
I'll be resting peacefully in

05:09.000 --> 05:10.689
after I bludgeon myself
to death.

05:10.758 --> 05:13.586
- Legendary bands.
Maroon 5!

05:13.655 --> 05:15.586
- Uh, how about a semi-circle?

05:15.655 --> 05:19.482
- Semi-charmed kind of life.
Third Eye Blind.

05:19.551 --> 05:22.413
- The tombstone above my grave
that reads "here lies Jake.

05:22.482 --> 05:24.965
He died doing what he hated,
being alive."

05:25.034 --> 05:27.758
- Do you realize you joke about
suicide, like, ten times a day?

05:27.827 --> 05:30.310
- No, I joke about suicide
six times a day.

05:30.379 --> 05:32.448
The other four
are sincere threats.

05:32.517 --> 05:33.931
- Whoo!

05:34.000 --> 05:35.275
Getting amped up now.

05:35.344 --> 05:37.896
Ooh, amps?
Electric guitar?

05:37.965 --> 05:39.137
Bands?
Maroon 5!

05:39.206 --> 05:40.724
- John, shut the fuck up!

05:45.379 --> 05:46.551
- Ugh.

05:48.344 --> 05:50.586
- Are you gonna clean that
bird shit off your windshield?

05:50.655 --> 05:52.448
- I can see fine.

05:52.517 --> 05:54.448
- Why don't you just use
your wiper fluid?

05:54.517 --> 05:56.068
- I don't think my car
has that.

05:56.137 --> 05:57.793
- Isn't it this?

05:59.827 --> 06:02.172
- Oh.
Weird.

06:02.241 --> 06:03.896
Well, whatever.

06:03.965 --> 06:05.724
I guess now I won't die
in a car accident.

06:05.793 --> 06:06.896
Thanks a lot, Matt.

06:10.241 --> 06:11.551
- Maybe you should go on meds.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.206
- There it is.

06:14.275 --> 06:16.620
Yet another good friend who
insists you lobotomize yourself

06:16.689 --> 06:18.448
by going on meds.

06:18.517 --> 06:21.000
- Well, I'd happily swallow
a cyanide pill right now

06:21.068 --> 06:22.827
if it would get me out
of this conversation.

06:22.896 --> 06:24.862
- Jake, you're miserable.

06:24.931 --> 06:28.137
There are easy things that you
could do to improve your life.

06:28.206 --> 06:31.379
And I'm gonna help you do them,
whether you like it or not.

06:31.448 --> 06:33.172
And you're gonna like it!

06:33.241 --> 06:35.551
- You know, I had a lot of
lovely things to say about you

06:35.620 --> 06:37.517
in my suicide note,

06:37.586 --> 06:39.862
but I might have to revise it
if you keep trying to fix me

06:39.931 --> 06:41.931
like some modern-day
Mary Poppins.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.655
- I'm not Mary Poppins.
I'm Matty Poppins.

06:44.724 --> 06:46.379
And I'm going to jam
that spoonful of sugar

06:46.448 --> 06:48.655
down your fucking throat
until the medicine goes down.

06:48.724 --> 06:52.344
Oh, and it will not be easy,
but it will go down.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.482
- I'm fine with that,

06:53.551 --> 06:54.758
as long as it leads
to me ODing.

06:54.827 --> 06:56.103
- Nice!

06:56.172 --> 06:59.275
Four suicide jokes in a row.
You're on fire.

07:09.551 --> 07:11.517
Home, disgusting home.

07:11.586 --> 07:13.551
- Hi, Pebbles.

07:17.034 --> 07:18.413
- Well, don't clean it.

07:18.482 --> 07:20.896
The cat's just gonna
shit in it again.

07:20.965 --> 07:23.310
- It smells pretty bad.
- Right, but only to you.

07:23.379 --> 07:25.137
- Great point.

07:25.206 --> 07:27.758
- I only make great points.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.758
- Matt?

07:35.827 --> 07:37.379
But I dropped you off
at your house.

07:37.448 --> 07:38.689
What are you doing at mine?

07:38.758 --> 07:40.172
- Never mind all that.

07:40.241 --> 07:41.689
Out of the way you go.

07:44.482 --> 07:46.793
No wonder
you're clinically depressed.

07:46.862 --> 07:48.482
This place is a mess!

07:48.551 --> 07:49.827
But don't despair.

07:49.896 --> 07:52.172
We'll simply clean up
your lair.

07:52.241 --> 07:54.448
- No, I'll never accept
your help.

07:56.034 --> 07:58.000
If I had a tuppence
for every time I've heard that,

07:58.068 --> 07:59.620
I could buy a lorry.

08:24.206 --> 08:27.517
If all you eat is junk,
no wonder you're in a funk.

08:27.586 --> 08:29.000
But if you eat organic,

08:29.068 --> 08:32.862
your self-hatred
won't be so volcanic.

08:32.931 --> 08:35.931
If you resolve
your deep-seated issues,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.068
you'll have no more use
for tissues.

08:39.965 --> 08:41.413
And if you right your poster,

08:41.482 --> 08:44.241
there'll be no need to bathe
with your toaster.

08:58.310 --> 09:00.379
That was a tricky
little fellow.

09:02.448 --> 09:06.482
You know, a 30-minute workout
is just 2% of your day.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.310
both:

09:38.655 --> 09:40.344
- These fucking refs
don't know

09:40.413 --> 09:42.413
what they're fucking
talking about.

09:44.034 --> 09:45.896
- What the fuck are
you doing here?

09:45.965 --> 09:47.551
- I brought you leafy greens.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.551
I read on the cover
of "Men's Health" magazine

09:49.620 --> 09:51.896
that a healthy diet
can help alleviate depression.

09:51.965 --> 09:54.689
Jake, just let me help you
turn your life around!

09:54.758 --> 09:56.275
- Matt, stop it!

09:56.344 --> 09:57.862
- Jake, eat the lettuce.
It's good for you.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.517
- I only eat food off
the floor on my terms!

10:01.586 --> 10:03.206
Stop it!

10:03.275 --> 10:07.034
- I talked to my doctor,
got on Shrilanka,

10:07.103 --> 10:09.724
and now I can enjoy life
again.

10:09.793 --> 10:12.172
- You know ads like this are
illegal in other countries?

10:12.241 --> 10:14.241
I can't believe anyone
takes that shit.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.000
- Jake, are you not on meds?

10:16.068 --> 10:17.241
- Yeah, I'm on meds,

10:17.310 --> 10:18.724
and I'm way less
fucked up than you are.

10:18.793 --> 10:20.137
What are you, like,

10:20.206 --> 10:22.758
a Jewish-Amish-Scientologist
-Christian Scientist?

10:22.827 --> 10:25.344
- Sorry if I don't want to deal
with the insane side effects.

10:25.413 --> 10:26.655
- It's really not that bad.

10:26.724 --> 10:29.517
It just get really dizzy
if I get up too fast.

10:29.586 --> 10:31.827
So now I just get up
like this.

10:36.241 --> 10:37.482
- Well, whatever.

10:37.551 --> 10:39.137
I don't want
my personality lobotomized

10:39.206 --> 10:40.482
by some stupid pill.

10:40.551 --> 10:42.689
- You don't even like
your personality.

10:42.758 --> 10:44.344
You hate yourself more
than anyone.

10:44.413 --> 10:45.724
- Oh, let me guess.

10:45.793 --> 10:47.517
You're worried it's gonna kill
your sex drive?

10:47.586 --> 10:48.827
- So what if I am?

10:48.896 --> 10:52.137
- Oh, you like having sex?
Grow up.

10:52.206 --> 10:54.551
- I bet he's also afraid
it's gonna kill his creativity.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.379
- Oh, yeah, I forgot!

10:56.448 --> 10:58.620
Jake is
a world-renowned artist.

10:58.689 --> 11:00.448
- Okay.
Got it.

11:00.517 --> 11:04.000
Thanks for much
for the lecture, guys.

11:04.068 --> 11:06.620
- Then boom.
Once you're up, you're up.

11:06.689 --> 11:08.931
And I can stay up
for as long as I want.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.862
- So here are all the shapes

11:11.931 --> 11:14.344
Christian has rejected.

11:14.413 --> 11:16.413
- So now we have to come up
with a new,

11:16.482 --> 11:18.517
totally original shape.

11:18.586 --> 11:20.310
- So who wants to step up
to the plate

11:20.379 --> 11:22.034
and take a shot at a new shape?

11:22.103 --> 11:24.241
Sherri?
Grab a Sharpie.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.689
- Go ahead
and right this ship Sherri.

11:28.758 --> 11:31.379
- Okay, a line.
Great start to any shape.

11:31.448 --> 11:33.724
- Looks like someone went
to art school.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.620
- Are you drugging me now?

11:36.689 --> 11:39.413
- It's just vitamin D.
- Matt, enough already.

11:39.482 --> 11:41.896
- Step aside and show us
your shape, Sherri.

11:44.310 --> 11:45.758
- A trapezoid?

11:45.827 --> 11:48.241
You think you invented
the fucking trapezoid, Sherri?

11:48.310 --> 11:49.586
- If you invented
the trapezoid,

11:49.655 --> 11:51.068
it wouldn't be called
a trapezoid.

11:51.137 --> 11:52.241
It would be called a Sherri.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.379
And you wouldn't be here.

11:53.448 --> 11:54.655
You'd be drowning in money,

11:54.724 --> 11:56.103
shouting for a ship
to bring you ashore.

11:56.172 --> 11:57.448
- It's a sham shape.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.413
Surrender the Sharpie,
sit down, and shut up, Sherri!

12:00.482 --> 12:01.931
- If it's so good for you,
you drink it.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.482
- No, Jake.
It's for you to drink.

12:03.551 --> 12:05.517
- Hey, what's going on
over here, Jake?

12:05.586 --> 12:06.862
- Matt started it.

12:06.931 --> 12:09.103
- Oh, what is this?
Kindergarten?

12:09.172 --> 12:11.068
We're trying to do
real adult work here,

12:11.137 --> 12:12.172
coming up with shapes.

12:12.241 --> 12:13.758
- You look like shit, Jake.

12:13.827 --> 12:15.517
Have you even shower or shaved?

12:15.586 --> 12:17.793
If you don't shape up,
we're gonna ship you out.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.413
- And same goes
for you, Sherri!

12:22.551 --> 12:24.862
- Shit.
Sorry, Sherri.

12:26.448 --> 12:28.482
- I mean, what are the chances
he even changes the logo?

12:28.551 --> 12:30.551
- He loves that logo.
- Yeah, no chance.

12:30.620 --> 12:33.551
- Hey, guys, um,
I just wanted to say,

12:33.620 --> 12:35.724
I think you were a little hard
on Jake back there.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.620
Um, you know
how depressed he is.

12:37.689 --> 12:40.103
And lately,
he's stopped going to therapy,

12:40.172 --> 12:41.724
and I'm just a little worried
that he might--

12:41.793 --> 12:44.310
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:44.379 --> 12:46.586
Hold the phone.

12:46.655 --> 12:50.965
If you're saying that Jake
might be clinically...

12:51.034 --> 12:52.172
- Down in the dumps.

12:52.241 --> 12:54.068
- And is in any way thinking
of committing...

12:54.137 --> 12:55.827
- A darn shame.

12:55.896 --> 13:00.172
- As his immediate supervisors,
we take that very seriously...

13:00.241 --> 13:01.862
as a legal liability.

13:01.931 --> 13:06.655
- Well, not to mention that
if Jake were to--God forbid--

13:06.724 --> 13:08.344
he ain't getting into Heaven.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.379
Thems the rules
and the breaks.

13:10.448 --> 13:12.551
- Maybe the best thing
is just to let him go.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.482
We don't want any more blood
on our blouses.

13:14.551 --> 13:17.103
- No, I-I really don't think
you need to do that.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.827
I honestly just think that
he could use a little exercise.

13:19.896 --> 13:22.000
- Exercise.
That's perfect.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.551
We'll make Jake go to the gym.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.793
That way we can say we made
a concerted effort

13:25.862 --> 13:27.172
to address
any mental-health issues.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.827
- We'll run him like a dog.

13:28.896 --> 13:31.172
Get his muscles so sore,
he can't even lift a gun.

13:31.241 --> 13:33.310
- Perfect.
Jake will love the gym.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.137
- Treadmill!
- Do some swimming!

13:35.206 --> 13:37.482
- Free weights and cardio!

13:37.551 --> 13:38.862
And the showers afterwards.

13:38.931 --> 13:40.862
- Yeah.
- We'll all take showers.

13:48.379 --> 13:50.965
- Sorry we had to take
the drawstring out of those.

13:51.034 --> 13:53.000
But this feels great, right?

13:53.068 --> 13:54.758
Aren't you loving the pain?

13:54.827 --> 13:56.310
- Keep your eyes
on the prize, Jake!

13:56.379 --> 13:57.586
There's no shortcuts to Heaven.

13:57.655 --> 13:59.655
We're gonna get that ass
so tight,

13:59.724 --> 14:01.896
the Man Upstairs
begs you to come upstairs!

14:01.965 --> 14:03.413
- You can do it, Jake.

14:03.482 --> 14:05.758
You know, a 30-minute workout
is just 2% of your day.

14:07.551 --> 14:09.413
- Or you could just stop
right now.

14:13.172 --> 14:14.586
all: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

14:14.655 --> 14:16.206
- Come on, buddy.
- Jake.

14:19.068 --> 14:20.310
- Here's some ice to help
the swelling.

14:20.379 --> 14:22.413
- Matt, that is the last thing
we need right now.

14:22.482 --> 14:24.344
- What happened out there
could be seen

14:24.413 --> 14:27.448
as an attempted whoopsie-daisy
on company premises,

14:27.517 --> 14:31.172
and if someone reported it, it
could be Ashley all over again.

14:31.241 --> 14:32.758
- Or Marcus and Mario.

14:32.827 --> 14:34.206
- Well, they really did
everything together.

14:34.275 --> 14:36.620
- Except seek help.
- I didn't try to kill myself.

14:36.689 --> 14:39.448
- Hey, it's not us
you have to convince.

14:39.517 --> 14:41.931
It's Saint Peter,
and he don't play.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.413
- Why don't you take
a week off work?

14:44.482 --> 14:46.068
That should give you some
time to dry out

14:46.137 --> 14:47.896
and come back happy as a clam.

14:47.965 --> 14:49.344
- I don't need time off.
I'm fine.

14:49.413 --> 14:51.724
- Oh, no.
It's not for your benefit.

14:51.793 --> 14:53.379
It's a legal precaution.

14:53.448 --> 14:55.000
It's a darn shame
you won't be paid, though.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.827
- But it will give you
some time alone to think.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.137
- Although when I'm alone,

15:00.206 --> 15:02.965
I just start thinking
about where the trash goes.

15:03.034 --> 15:05.758
All those pudding cups
from my youth--

15:05.827 --> 15:07.448
where are they now?

15:07.517 --> 15:11.103
Still out there,
filling the landfills...

15:11.172 --> 15:13.241
choking the oceans.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.758
The birds.

15:14.827 --> 15:16.379
Nope!
Nope!

15:16.448 --> 15:17.517
None of those thoughts.

15:17.586 --> 15:19.068
Let's go, team.
Keep it moving.

15:19.137 --> 15:20.379
Moves like Jagger!
Maroon 5!

15:20.448 --> 15:22.000
- John!

15:27.448 --> 15:29.206
- Don't answer.

15:29.275 --> 15:32.310
They're the reason you're
like this in the first place.

15:34.758 --> 15:36.655
Oh, let's see if there's
anything in the fridge.

15:36.724 --> 15:38.413
Ah, of course there isn't.

15:38.482 --> 15:40.827
You haven't been to the store
in six months.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.896
It's crazy you can't find
a girlfriend,

15:42.965 --> 15:45.758
considering what a lovely place
you have here

15:45.827 --> 15:49.103
and, of course,
your sparkling personality.

15:52.482 --> 15:56.034
- This team sucks
even more than you.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.448
- Not this bullshit again.

16:05.517 --> 16:09.172
- I talked to my doctor,
got on Shrilanka, and now...

16:09.241 --> 16:11.862
- I'm gonna take a dump.

16:11.931 --> 16:16.034
- Shrilanka is not
for everyone...

16:16.103 --> 16:19.586
- Hey, Jake, I'm sorry for
trying to force you to change.

16:19.655 --> 16:22.172
I did it 'cause
I really care about you,

16:22.241 --> 16:25.620
but also, I probably wanted
to feel like a hero, too.

16:25.689 --> 16:28.103
I hope you and your face
are doing okay.

16:28.172 --> 16:30.413
If you need anything,
I'm here for you.

16:30.482 --> 16:33.517
Love, your annoying friend,
Matt.

16:35.068 --> 16:37.379
- No, Matt,
I'm the annoying one.

16:37.448 --> 16:39.655
I really do appreciate you
trying to help me.

16:39.724 --> 16:41.379
I know I probably
should go on meds,

16:41.448 --> 16:43.137
but I'm scared
I won't be me anymore,

16:43.206 --> 16:44.758
even though
I don't really like

16:44.827 --> 16:46.655
who me is most of the time.

16:46.724 --> 16:48.655
But maybe
it's time I finally--

16:48.724 --> 16:52.137
- Wow.
You really suck at writing.

16:52.206 --> 16:54.862
I can't believe you majored
in English.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.344
Look at me.

16:56.413 --> 16:58.448
- I think I'm Raymond Carver
or Mark Twain or something.

16:59.758 --> 17:01.517
By the way,
I was wondering,

17:01.586 --> 17:04.896
which of your ex-girlfriends do
you think resents you the most?

17:06.931 --> 17:08.862
- Pebbles.
- Wow.

17:08.931 --> 17:11.000
Even your cat doesn't love you.

17:12.931 --> 17:15.482
- Hey.
Pebbles loves me.

17:15.551 --> 17:17.827
- Then why did she piss
on your floor?

17:17.896 --> 17:21.793
- Because you told me not
to clean her litter box.

17:21.862 --> 17:23.310
- Look, if you weren't here,

17:23.379 --> 17:25.655
she's be cuddling
the coffee table leg

17:25.724 --> 17:28.000
or nuzzling the side
of the toilet.

17:28.068 --> 17:30.862
- Don't you dare talk about
my cat daughter like that.

17:30.931 --> 17:32.551
- Okay, Sports Boy.

17:32.620 --> 17:34.724
If you want to believe
your cat loves you, fine.

17:34.793 --> 17:37.379
But have I ever lied
to you before?

17:45.482 --> 17:48.241
- What the hell are you doing?

17:48.310 --> 17:50.241
- I'm going for a jog.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.448
- Good one.

17:52.517 --> 17:54.586
Okay, look,
you made your point.

17:54.655 --> 17:57.103
I'm sorry I insulted
your stupid cat.

17:57.172 --> 17:59.413
I know you don't want to go
for a jog,

17:59.482 --> 18:02.724
not when you could take a nap
in your comfy bed.

18:02.793 --> 18:05.310
- I can't nap because
you gave me insomnia.

18:05.379 --> 18:07.172
- That doesn't mean you can't
curl up with a blanket,

18:07.241 --> 18:09.137
close your eyes, and think
about all your problems.

18:09.206 --> 18:10.724
Wait!

18:12.000 --> 18:14.310
You don't really want
to go for a run.

18:14.379 --> 18:16.689
You're lazy and weak.

18:16.758 --> 18:20.068
But it's okay.
I understand.

18:20.137 --> 18:22.482
Look, I know you better than
you know yourself.

18:22.551 --> 18:25.310
I've been watching over
you since you were a kid.

18:25.379 --> 18:27.551
In fact, I've been in
your family for centuries,

18:27.620 --> 18:30.344
watching over generation
after generation

18:30.413 --> 18:32.379
of depressed Levinsons.

18:32.448 --> 18:35.448
You won't leave,
you can't leave,

18:35.517 --> 18:39.793
because you belong here
with me, Sports Boy.

18:42.379 --> 18:43.862
- Wow.

18:43.931 --> 18:45.862
You really suck
at giving speeches.

18:45.931 --> 18:47.482
- Huh?

18:47.551 --> 18:49.724
- Well,
guess I better get to it.

18:49.793 --> 18:52.137
As my best friend like to say,

18:52.206 --> 18:56.827
"You know, a 30-minute workout
is just 2% of your day."

18:56.896 --> 19:00.310
- Sports Boy!

19:25.689 --> 19:28.896
- I talked to my doctor,
got on Shrilanka,

19:28.965 --> 19:31.793
and now
I can enjoy life again.

19:31.862 --> 19:34.896
- So I finally read
Matt's short stories,

19:34.965 --> 19:37.241
and I'm pretty sure
he plagiarized them

19:37.310 --> 19:38.689
from Raymond Carver.

19:38.758 --> 19:40.620
- We should totally get Matt
on meds.

19:40.689 --> 19:42.379
That way he'll lose
his creativity,

19:42.448 --> 19:43.689
and he'll stop writing forever.

19:45.931 --> 19:48.413
- All right, back to the grind.

19:50.448 --> 19:52.862
- Change is never easy,

19:52.931 --> 19:57.862
but we have finally decided
on a new shape for our logo.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.068
- Square!

19:59.137 --> 20:00.413
It seems obvious now.

20:00.482 --> 20:02.068
It's like
a four-sided triangle.

20:02.137 --> 20:06.068
- So are we all okay
with this shape?

20:06.137 --> 20:09.275
Jake, how does this shape
make you feel?

20:09.344 --> 20:10.689
- I feel fine.

20:10.758 --> 20:11.862
- Oh, wow.

20:11.931 --> 20:13.103
It's a Chanukah miracle.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.413
- Great.
We're all set.

20:14.482 --> 20:17.586
So now all we have to do
is select a color.

20:17.655 --> 20:19.379
- Hmm.
- Should be simple.

20:19.448 --> 20:21.103
Sherri, want to get us started?

20:21.172 --> 20:22.586
- Well, don't be shy, Sherri!

20:22.655 --> 20:24.655
Shimmy on up here
and select a shade.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.620
- So the meds
seem to be working.

20:26.689 --> 20:27.965
- I do feel a little better.

20:28.034 --> 20:30.137
I mean, I still think
everything is terrible

20:30.206 --> 20:31.379
and life is pointless,

20:31.448 --> 20:33.206
but it's just not that big
of a deal anymore.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.655
So, thanks.

20:34.724 --> 20:37.689
- Well, then it looks like
my work here is done.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.551
- It wasn't you,
and the work's not done.

20:39.620 --> 20:41.448
Managing my depression
will take constant effort

20:41.517 --> 20:43.000
for the rest of my life.
