WEBVTT

00:48.382 --> 00:49.216
Mom?

00:50.966 --> 00:52.050
What is it, Danny?

00:52.176 --> 00:53.717
Can I sleep with you?

00:53.842 --> 00:56.843
- I could go.
- No, no. He's too old for this.

00:57.802 --> 01:00.470
Let's not play this game
tonight, Daniel.

01:01.012 --> 01:02.013
Please?

01:02.138 --> 01:03.971
I feel lonesome.

01:06.430 --> 01:09.431
Like I'm the only person
in the whole world.

01:11.558 --> 01:13.224
Go back to bed, honey.

03:48.826 --> 03:52.494
You're up past your bedtime,
Daniel Moore.

03:58.830 --> 03:59.954
Daniel?

04:11.709 --> 04:12.625
Hello.

04:14.877 --> 04:17.043
My name is Charlie Manx.

04:18.462 --> 04:22.089
And I understand
what it is to feel lonesome.

04:22.754 --> 04:25.505
To feel like you're the only person

04:26.214 --> 04:28.174
in the whole world.

04:32.091 --> 04:33.551
No, no.

04:33.926 --> 04:35.342
Don't fret, my boy.

04:36.093 --> 04:38.385
Those presents will return to you

04:38.468 --> 04:41.970
just as soon as we arrive
at Christmasland.

04:43.179 --> 04:44.681
It's a very special place

04:44.804 --> 04:49.849
where every day is Christmas Day
and unhappiness is against the law.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.349
Would you like to go there?

04:55.600 --> 04:57.227
I want my mom.

05:06.438 --> 05:07.729
Daniel!

05:08.522 --> 05:09.815
Mom!

05:13.731 --> 05:16.734
Your mother wasn't interested
in your games, Daniel Moore.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.735
And she isn't interested in you.

05:27.487 --> 05:29.489
Run! Run!

05:30.321 --> 05:33.281
Just wait till we get
to Christmasland.

05:34.282 --> 05:37.199
Everybody loves games there.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.784
Daniel, baby, run!

07:15.738 --> 07:16.904
Vic?

07:17.029 --> 07:19.362
- Oh, my God, hi.
- Hi.

07:19.487 --> 07:20.488
I saw your mother...

07:20.614 --> 07:23.072
Yeah. I'm just helping her out
for the summer.

07:23.197 --> 07:24.157
Cool.

07:24.282 --> 07:26.908
I could never work with my mother.
I think I'd kill her.

07:27.325 --> 07:28.409
Yeah.

07:30.576 --> 07:33.827
Speaking of my mother,
where are you applying?

07:33.952 --> 07:35.911
Oh, you know. All over.

07:36.411 --> 07:39.245
You probably get early admissions,
you smart bitch.

07:40.455 --> 07:42.246
How's Exeter?

07:44.123 --> 07:45.539
A shit-show.

07:45.664 --> 07:48.665
All AP classes, plus sports
and the internship...

07:48.790 --> 07:51.791
My mother will kill herself
if I don't get into an Ivy.

07:51.917 --> 07:54.918
Yeah, well, you're real smart
so you will.

07:57.668 --> 07:58.920
Man...

07:59.670 --> 08:01.754
Vic McQueen.

08:02.463 --> 08:05.547
Last time I saw you, your dad took me
for a ride on his Harley.

08:05.672 --> 08:08.673
Eighth grade graduation.
You screamed all the way.

08:08.798 --> 08:11.591
- He drove like a psycho.
- Probably, yeah!

08:15.092 --> 08:17.384
- Are you going to Winnipesaukee?
- Yeah.

08:17.468 --> 08:19.011
My parents are throwing a party.

08:20.552 --> 08:23.221
You should come.
It will be like old times.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.763
- Come.
- I don't hear vacuuming.

08:27.513 --> 08:28.514
Oh, Willa.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.098
Sorry, Miss McQueen.
Let me get out of your hair.

08:31.223 --> 08:32.725
You should come.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.350
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

08:59.901 --> 09:04.278
You have been
such a big help this summer.

09:05.569 --> 09:08.113
Maybe we can keep it up
after you graduate.

09:09.696 --> 09:13.073
I know cleaning toilets
isn't glamorous but it's steady work.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.365
I make my own hours,

09:15.490 --> 09:17.867
and the money is pretty good,
don't you think?

09:17.990 --> 09:20.701
We could go into business together.
It would be fun.

09:23.994 --> 09:25.535
Vicky...

09:27.911 --> 09:30.080
You have one year
of high school left.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.081
You've got to do something
when it's over.

09:35.373 --> 09:37.124
Willa's going to college.

09:37.748 --> 09:40.874
Yeah, but...
Willa's parents have money.

09:40.999 --> 09:42.334
Yeah, I know.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.293
Those college kids can't get work
these days.

09:47.418 --> 09:49.879
They've got to move back in
with their parents.

09:55.547 --> 09:58.382
Your father and I can't support you
forever, Vicky.

09:58.507 --> 09:59.716
I know, Ma.

10:21.224 --> 10:22.807
- Get her running?
- Yeah!

10:22.932 --> 10:24.850
You know what they say about Harleys.

10:24.976 --> 10:27.059
Yeah. They Harley ever run.

10:28.143 --> 10:31.395
How's the cleaning biz?
Keeping an eye on your mom?

10:31.520 --> 10:34.521
I don't understand why people
can't clean their own houses.

10:34.938 --> 10:39.271
Mrs Brewster doesn't have a job.
What does she even do all day?

10:39.397 --> 10:43.273
I don't know, but it's good she does
or we'd be out on the street.

10:43.399 --> 10:45.983
- I paid the mortgage, Linda.
- Great!

10:47.401 --> 10:51.027
What about the power,
the car insurance, the credit card...

10:51.152 --> 10:54.278
- Yeah, where is the credit card?
- My credit card?

10:55.152 --> 10:56.529
Our credit card.

10:57.279 --> 10:58.737
What time did you get in?

10:58.862 --> 11:01.905
Come on, you just got here.
You really want to start that?

11:02.030 --> 11:03.907
What? It's a simple question.

11:04.032 --> 11:05.699
I'm not a child, Linda.

11:15.786 --> 11:16.994
Joe.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.080
- What's going on?
- Maggie.

11:22.205 --> 11:24.872
You can't be here right now.
We've had a break-in.

11:24.998 --> 11:26.082
In Here, Iowa?

11:26.207 --> 11:29.250
Is somebody gunning
for Karen's Hummel collection?

11:33.625 --> 11:36.292
- Oh, my God.
- I can't let you back there.

11:36.418 --> 11:38.670
- Joe, where's Danny?
- He's missing.

11:38.795 --> 11:40.712
He was supposed
to come to the library.

11:40.837 --> 11:42.088
I was going to walk him.

11:42.213 --> 11:43.921
Maggie, let us handle it.

11:44.046 --> 11:48.007
We don't know who we're dealing with.
Just go to work.

11:48.590 --> 11:49.548
We'll find him.

11:50.757 --> 11:51.675
Go.

12:29.355 --> 12:32.148
You lost the credit card.
You lost it, OK?

12:32.273 --> 12:35.566
No, I gave it back to you
after we got back from the market.

12:36.442 --> 12:39.192
You lost it at the bar,
buying rounds for God-knows-who.

12:39.317 --> 12:42.110
- I was not at the bar.
- Bullshit, Chris!

12:42.235 --> 12:44.610
Why did you marry me?
You think I'm a moron.

12:44.736 --> 12:47.153
No, Chris, I think
you're a fricking drunk.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.654
You lost the credit card,
you lunatic. Not me.

12:50.779 --> 12:53.157
You lost it, just the way
you lose everything.

12:53.282 --> 12:56.823
You wonder why I can't stand
being in this house with you?

12:56.948 --> 12:58.450
This is why, Linda. All this.

12:58.575 --> 13:00.450
God damn you, Chris!

13:17.206 --> 13:21.208
You lost it at the bar, just, like,
buying rounds for God-knows-who.

13:21.333 --> 13:25.002
Oh, my God, why did you even marry me
if you think I'm such a moron?

13:29.127 --> 13:31.921
I don't think you're a moron.
I think you're a drunk.

13:33.212 --> 13:35.546
You lost the credit card,
you lunatic. Not me.

13:35.671 --> 13:38.257
You lost it, just the way
you lose everything.

14:59.411 --> 15:00.954
Hello.

15:02.037 --> 15:04.456
Who do we have here?

16:16.899 --> 16:17.775
Hey, Maggot.

16:17.942 --> 16:20.359
Hey, Weasel. Take me for a ride?

16:20.442 --> 16:23.110
Not without a helmet.
Let's see what you got.

16:23.652 --> 16:25.777
Hey, Mittens. Looking good.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.112
He shit under the bed
so Mom threw him out and he took off.

16:29.237 --> 16:31.405
Steve said he's gonna die out here.

16:32.029 --> 16:35.864
Well, you tell Steve every cat dies.
Not every cat lives.

16:37.533 --> 16:39.324
When's our next movie night?

16:39.449 --> 16:41.076
Next time you need a babysitter.

16:42.492 --> 16:45.409
You OK? You look weird.

16:45.535 --> 16:46.869
Headache.

16:47.912 --> 16:49.537
It's for you. Feel better.

16:49.662 --> 16:50.955
Thanks, kiddo.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.371
Haley, come on in!

16:52.496 --> 16:54.955
Ma! I'm starved!

17:13.920 --> 17:15.505
- Hey, Brat.
- Hey.

17:15.630 --> 17:18.214
- You want any tonic?
- No, thanks.

17:24.967 --> 17:25.843
Mom?

17:29.511 --> 17:30.802
Mom?

17:34.929 --> 17:36.512
Hey, Dad,
is Mom lying down?

17:36.637 --> 17:38.389
She's supposed to take me
to art class.

17:39.348 --> 17:41.181
I don't know what she's doing.

17:44.808 --> 17:47.100
You know what, Vic...

17:47.684 --> 17:49.433
Your mom and I...

17:50.268 --> 17:51.519
You know, your mom...

17:51.644 --> 17:54.603
I don't want to clean houses with her
after I graduate.

17:57.479 --> 18:00.397
There's nothing wrong
with cleaning houses. I just...

18:03.231 --> 18:06.023
- She thinks it's all I can do.
- That's not true.

18:08.151 --> 18:09.567
I want to go to college.

18:09.692 --> 18:11.859
Good. You should.
You're smart.

18:13.694 --> 18:14.901
For art.

18:20.905 --> 18:22.530
You know that I...

18:23.364 --> 18:26.282
I wanted to be a composer
when I was your age.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.033
I knew you had that band.

18:30.159 --> 18:33.827
Yeah. Those jerks drank
more than they played, but...

18:33.952 --> 18:36.703
But you guys got
to go different places, travel...

18:36.828 --> 18:38.870
Yeah, a couple.
Boston, New York.

18:38.995 --> 18:40.288
But I...

18:40.828 --> 18:44.246
I thought I was going to music school
when I got out of the Service.

18:44.371 --> 18:45.831
It was too expensive?

18:45.956 --> 18:48.665
Your mom got pregnant.
I had to get a job.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.040
You know. I couldn't do it.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.000
But you...

18:55.126 --> 18:58.169
You're young and you're brilliant.

18:58.794 --> 19:00.627
And you're unencumbered.

19:01.503 --> 19:04.004
You know,
you can make it work.

19:06.047 --> 19:09.507
- Mom says I'm not even...
- Your mom is just scared, Brat.

19:10.298 --> 19:13.090
She's lived in Haverhill
since the day she was born.

19:13.966 --> 19:15.593
There's a whole world out there.

19:16.258 --> 19:19.259
If you let fear dictate your life,
you miss it.

19:20.719 --> 19:22.886
I just got one piece of advice.

19:23.803 --> 19:24.888
Yeah?

19:27.096 --> 19:28.971
Never get married.

19:29.763 --> 19:32.016
- Never, ever...
- Ever...

19:32.139 --> 19:33.682
Have any kids.

19:36.558 --> 19:38.226
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah.

19:38.850 --> 19:40.518
You should play more.

19:43.269 --> 19:44.520
Hop on.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.315
You good?

20:16.699 --> 20:19.491
- Matty, how's your father?
- He'll be out in a few days.

20:19.617 --> 20:22.117
Good. That's real good.
What's up, Molly May?

20:22.242 --> 20:23.327
Hi, Chris.

20:23.909 --> 20:26.203
Craigster,
see you on the job tomorrow?

20:26.328 --> 20:28.494
- You got it.
- Alright. Good man.

20:29.037 --> 20:32.288
- Brat, love you like a big dog.
- Love you.

20:35.539 --> 20:38.540
- What are you, adopted?
- Linda got fresh with the mailman.

20:38.665 --> 20:40.874
Nine months later,
straight edge here was born.

20:40.999 --> 20:43.458
At least I wasn't scraped
out of a stale crack pipe

20:43.583 --> 20:44.959
like you two winners.

20:48.085 --> 20:49.877
I hate this town.

20:50.878 --> 20:51.921
Same.

20:57.422 --> 21:01.216
Bing Partridge, you're about
to lose your freaking mind.

21:01.341 --> 21:04.550
- Is it Doctor Incubus?
- The very next instalment.

21:07.593 --> 21:11.220
Jeez, I haven't even returned
Doctor Boomerang yet.

21:11.718 --> 21:13.678
I guess that makes it Doctor Stick.

21:15.929 --> 21:17.555
That's a lot of doctors.

21:18.888 --> 21:21.182
We've got to get to class.
We can't be late.

21:21.307 --> 21:22.598
Let me know what you think.

21:22.723 --> 21:26.516
Trading books with this old fool
makes you the nicest girl in school.

21:27.267 --> 21:28.266
Jeez.

21:28.975 --> 21:32.060
Well, it's a pretty low bar
at William White, but thanks.

21:32.185 --> 21:35.394
We can't be late, so let's go.

21:35.519 --> 21:37.895
- Bye, Bing.
- Bye.

22:04.364 --> 22:06.157
Where is Daniel?

22:40.002 --> 22:41.504
That's a good start.

22:42.836 --> 22:44.380
That's good progress.

22:47.381 --> 22:49.464
The model doesn't inspire you?

22:49.589 --> 22:51.174
I'm sorry.

22:51.299 --> 22:52.715
Beautiful line quality

22:52.840 --> 22:55.216
and interesting composition,
as usual.

22:56.926 --> 23:01.218
Mrs Simonson, do you think I could,
you know, get into art school?

23:02.636 --> 23:05.595
Work up a portfolio
and I think you have a shot at RISD.

23:06.805 --> 23:08.721
RISD's expensive.

23:08.846 --> 23:12.515
Vic, apply for financial aid.
Plenty of kids do it.

23:16.725 --> 23:18.892
That reminds me
of the Shorter Way Bridge

23:19.017 --> 23:20.725
off of Pitman Street.

23:20.850 --> 23:22.269
I had my first kiss there.

23:22.394 --> 23:24.519
I was devastated
when they tore it down.

23:25.603 --> 23:28.104
The covered bridge off Pitman?
They tore it down?

23:28.229 --> 23:30.771
- About 15 years ago.
- Are you sure?

23:30.896 --> 23:32.773
People thought
it was a public hazard.

23:32.898 --> 23:35.148
I guess it probably was. Shame.

23:45.403 --> 23:48.320
You left a real mess
back there, Mr Ives.

23:48.445 --> 23:50.153
A real mess.

23:50.570 --> 23:53.738
Dead bodies,
one of your infernal syringes,

23:53.863 --> 23:56.948
and worst of all,
the boy heard his mother scream.

23:57.073 --> 23:59.282
Terrible trauma
for a boy of that age.

24:00.074 --> 24:02.491
I didn't think that the mother
would have a man over

24:02.616 --> 24:03.951
in the middle of the night.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.535
You know the sort of parents
we're dealing with.

24:07.202 --> 24:08.618
The sort of women...

24:08.743 --> 24:11.079
You're right.
I should have anticipated.

24:11.204 --> 24:14.372
Your lack of foresight will be
a boon for the local police.

24:14.497 --> 24:16.038
I'm sorry, Mr Manx.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.165
It would be easier
to accept your apology

24:18.289 --> 24:19.832
if it were the first time.

24:19.957 --> 24:21.665
But it's becoming a pattern.

24:22.207 --> 24:24.209
No, Mr Ives,

24:24.334 --> 24:28.001
you will not be going with us
to Christmasland.

24:28.126 --> 24:29.377
But this kid is the tenth.

24:29.502 --> 24:32.670
I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times.

24:32.795 --> 24:35.879
There's a nice list
and a naughty list.

24:36.005 --> 24:38.797
Please, Mr Manx.
It won't happen again, I promise.

24:38.922 --> 24:41.298
And you've gotten yourself...

24:41.423 --> 24:43.174
on my naughty list.

24:59.222 --> 25:00.805
You killed him.

25:02.348 --> 25:04.640
He was a very bad man.

25:05.182 --> 25:07.224
Bad people ought to be punished.

25:08.058 --> 25:09.808
He hurt my mother, didn't he?

25:09.933 --> 25:11.601
Under no circumstances

25:11.727 --> 25:13.977
could we take him with us
to Christmasland.

25:14.102 --> 25:16.644
Not one in a million is allowed in.

25:17.562 --> 25:20.104
Only those who truly deserve it.

25:20.730 --> 25:21.605
Like me.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.064
Like you.

25:42.237 --> 25:44.988
Oh, my God! That's freaky.

25:49.532 --> 25:51.991
These just keep getting
better and better.

25:52.116 --> 25:55.284
Yeah, well, I practice a lot
because I have no friends.

25:55.409 --> 25:57.786
- Stop.
- No, it's true.

25:58.910 --> 26:00.245
Since Willa left for Exeter,

26:00.370 --> 26:03.330
and Craig started getting high
all the time and skipping school...

26:04.662 --> 26:08.205
Nobody else likes me at William White
because, you know, I read.

26:08.331 --> 26:10.166
- Well...
- Well...

26:10.291 --> 26:12.207
So they think I'm weird.

26:12.333 --> 26:15.292
Which I probably am,
to be frank.

26:16.710 --> 26:19.002
Beats the hell out of being normal.

26:22.879 --> 26:24.628
Drawing is just...

26:25.588 --> 26:28.130
something I can do by myself, and...

26:29.089 --> 26:32.591
When I'm really into it,
when I'm on, like, a roll...

26:33.882 --> 26:35.633
Well, it's like being on a bike.

26:45.054 --> 26:47.304
My teacher says that...

26:51.056 --> 26:53.431
...that one reminds her
of the Shorter Way Bridge.

26:53.556 --> 26:56.349
Oh, my God, yeah. Wow.

26:58.100 --> 27:01.810
We used to get into
a lot of trouble on that bridge.

27:06.644 --> 27:09.270
You know, I helped demo that bridge
when you were a kid.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.521
Felt like I was blowing up my youth.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.815
Are there any other ones like it,
out in the woods?

27:16.940 --> 27:18.025
No, not like that.

27:19.566 --> 27:21.649
They don't make them
like that anymore.

27:22.150 --> 27:24.692
Alright. Burger...

27:25.860 --> 27:27.403
Burger...

27:27.528 --> 27:28.903
Frappe.

27:29.528 --> 27:31.570
Frappe, frappe...

27:32.321 --> 27:33.906
- There you go.
- Thank you.

27:34.031 --> 27:36.990
Who's ready for fireworks? Vicky?

27:37.115 --> 27:38.239
I'm ready.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.658
Look at that.

27:41.699 --> 27:44.533
Oh, a bridge. Very nice, honey.

27:45.034 --> 27:47.326
I'd hate to meet a bear
on that bridge.

27:48.285 --> 27:50.619
Her teacher thinks
she can get into art school.

27:50.744 --> 27:53.497
I'm sure she could.
Is her teacher going to pay for it?

27:59.916 --> 28:03.042
- I could get financial aid.
- No, that means loans.

28:03.167 --> 28:06.958
A pile of debt before you're 20?
No, Vicky's too smart for that.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.462
Eat up. Let's get to the lake.

28:16.089 --> 28:17.671
Willa invited me to her lake house.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.880
- Can you look after that?
- You got it.

28:20.672 --> 28:23.840
- Vicky, the fireworks.
- I'll watch them over there.

28:24.966 --> 28:26.883
I thought we were going
to watch them...

28:27.008 --> 28:29.675
Linda, she's 18.
Let her be with her friends.

28:29.801 --> 28:31.719
- Vic?
- What?

28:31.844 --> 28:33.511
You know how to get back?

28:33.636 --> 28:36.804
I could walk there blindfolded, Dad.
See you tonight.

29:08.607 --> 29:11.316
Vic McQueen,
as I live and breathe!

29:11.441 --> 29:13.318
Hi, Mrs Brewster.

29:14.609 --> 29:17.777
- Willa invited me.
- And I was so glad she did.

29:18.653 --> 29:20.113
You're a good egg, Vic.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.737
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

29:27.406 --> 29:28.990
Ah, lemonade.

29:31.533 --> 29:32.909
Thank you.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.326
Before I forget...

29:41.620 --> 29:43.453
You lost the credit card!

29:43.578 --> 29:44.413
Not me!

29:44.538 --> 29:47.205
You lost it, just the way
you lose everything!

29:47.330 --> 29:48.957
Did Willa find this?

29:49.082 --> 29:51.874
Your mother dropped it.
I meant to give it to her.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.834
But we were rushing around,
trying to get up here.

29:54.959 --> 29:57.543
- You alright?
- Yeah, sorry.

29:57.668 --> 29:59.626
My parents were looking for this.

29:59.751 --> 30:01.878
Willa's over there
with the rest of her friends.

30:02.003 --> 30:04.087
- Thank you. Bye.
- Have a good time.

30:04.212 --> 30:05.296
Oh, my god, Vic!

30:05.878 --> 30:08.005
- Vic, hi! You came!
- Hi.

30:08.131 --> 30:09.964
Hey. Come here.

30:10.756 --> 30:12.464
You guys, this is Vic.

30:12.923 --> 30:15.507
Everybody, this is Vic.
We grew up together.

30:15.632 --> 30:17.008
She's my best friend.

30:19.342 --> 30:21.926
- Vodka?
- No, thank you.

30:22.468 --> 30:25.553
I thought all Haverhill townies
were hopeless alcoholics.

30:25.678 --> 30:26.762
I guess I was wrong.

30:27.805 --> 30:31.388
I thought Exeter kids were douchebags
with their heads up their ass.

30:32.097 --> 30:33.723
I guess the jury's still out.

30:35.974 --> 30:37.308
Your shirt.

30:38.307 --> 30:39.684
Is that an Andy Bryant?

30:40.351 --> 30:41.350
Yeah.

30:44.852 --> 30:46.061
It's awesome.

30:48.311 --> 30:49.563
Thanks.

30:51.855 --> 30:55.064
- Good morning, Joe.
- Hey, shouldn't you be at work?

30:55.189 --> 30:58.649
- Iowa observes Labor Day weekend.
- Great country. Hey, Frank.

30:58.774 --> 31:01.692
Yes. Thank you, organized labor.

31:03.525 --> 31:05.110
Do you know...

31:05.527 --> 31:09.861
if anybody in town drives
an old Rolls Royce Wraith?

31:11.696 --> 31:12.945
Anybody?

31:15.406 --> 31:18.782
Maggie, we found a body last night.

31:21.116 --> 31:23.575
Out in Plymouth. Plymouth County.

31:24.033 --> 31:27.243
Peter Ives...
A nurse practitioner down in Florida.

31:28.578 --> 31:31.203
Wanted for disappearances
all over the country.

31:31.704 --> 31:34.079
We think he killed Karen
and her boyfriend.

31:34.204 --> 31:35.704
What about Danny?

31:37.581 --> 31:41.124
I hate to say this, kid,
but in these kinds of cases...

31:41.956 --> 31:44.208
it's probably not good.

31:46.792 --> 31:50.669
Well, did Peter Ives own
a Rolls-Royce Wraith?

31:51.462 --> 31:53.420
OK, what's with the Wraith?

31:54.129 --> 31:56.921
I think if you find the Wraith,
you'll find Danny.

31:58.212 --> 32:00.381
Because my Scrabble tiles
told me about it.

32:00.506 --> 32:01.422
Your tiles...

32:01.547 --> 32:06.091
And they have been right before.
Mrs Richardson? In the quarry?

32:06.675 --> 32:09.468
OK, you get a gold star
for Mrs Richardson.

32:09.593 --> 32:12.677
But we solved this case
the old-fashioned way.

32:14.177 --> 32:15.845
Sorry about Danny.

32:19.555 --> 32:22.055
- Can I keep this?
- Knock yourself out.

32:22.181 --> 32:25.015
It'll be all over the news tomorrow,
anyway.

32:32.477 --> 32:35.436
Wait, I heard a kid got stabbed
at William White.

32:35.561 --> 32:37.811
- The last week of school.
- Yeah. Joey Ricci.

32:37.936 --> 32:39.313
- What?
- Oh, my God.

32:39.438 --> 32:40.687
It's fine.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.855
I showed Joey my underwear
when I was four,

32:43.980 --> 32:45.690
and his mom called me a slut.

32:48.649 --> 32:49.982
You are a slut.

32:51.525 --> 32:54.193
You know what?
I am kind of a slut, Vic.

32:54.318 --> 32:55.152
Really?

32:55.277 --> 32:58.069
All Exeter girls are.
It's on their college apps.

32:58.653 --> 33:00.403
So where are you going to college?

33:00.945 --> 33:01.821
RISD.

33:02.487 --> 33:04.363
I wish I could go to art school.

33:04.489 --> 33:06.989
- So go.
- Doctors Butler wouldn't like it.

33:07.573 --> 33:09.198
His parents are doctors.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.825
And they have all the money, so...

33:11.948 --> 33:13.200
What do your parents do?

33:13.950 --> 33:17.035
My mother cleans houses
and my father is in demolition.

33:22.578 --> 33:25.037
No, I'm sorry. It's just...

33:26.538 --> 33:28.121
You're obviously smart.

33:29.456 --> 33:30.540
OK.

33:31.998 --> 33:34.790
We just figured
your parents were smart, too.

33:34.916 --> 33:38.167
Her parents are smart. I know them.
Her mom cleans my house.

33:42.252 --> 33:44.085
I need a glass of water.

33:53.797 --> 33:57.257
Such a boring question.
"What do your parents do?"

33:58.133 --> 34:00.052
Yeah, like you could do better.

34:01.468 --> 34:03.261
I absolutely could.

34:06.054 --> 34:07.762
What are you afraid of?

34:16.806 --> 34:17.974
Well...

34:19.724 --> 34:21.059
OK.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.851
I am afraid...

34:27.018 --> 34:29.811
...that my father's gonna leave
and I'll live with my mother.

34:30.521 --> 34:33.522
I'm afraid I'll get stuck
in Haverhill my whole life.

34:33.647 --> 34:35.855
And most of all,
I'm afraid I'm going crazy,

34:35.980 --> 34:38.024
because the other day,

34:38.149 --> 34:40.608
I saw a huge-ass bridge
in the middle of the woods

34:40.733 --> 34:42.942
that was apparently demolished
years ago.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.485
Sure it was the same bridge?

34:50.654 --> 34:54.197
There's a second covered bridge
in the woods by my house?

34:57.657 --> 34:59.406
Maybe it's a ghost.

35:00.449 --> 35:01.865
Maybe you're crazy.

35:02.407 --> 35:04.284
Maybe you're a time traveler.

35:25.041 --> 35:27.083
So is this your idea of fun?

35:28.209 --> 35:30.002
Slumming with the Haverhill townie?

35:31.460 --> 35:34.127
- What? No, I...
- I need a glass of water.

35:40.838 --> 35:42.757
- Vic.
- Hi. Sorry.

35:42.882 --> 35:45.091
- You enjoying the party?
- Yes. Thank you.

35:45.216 --> 35:47.299
The fireworks are gonna be beautiful.

35:48.634 --> 35:49.883
Yeah.

35:52.594 --> 35:53.593
How is your mother?

35:53.718 --> 35:56.094
Because I tried to talk to her
this morning,

35:56.219 --> 35:57.845
but she was all business.

35:58.638 --> 36:00.012
That's Linda.

36:03.931 --> 36:05.514
You know...

36:06.265 --> 36:08.183
I donate
to a women's shelter in town.

36:08.308 --> 36:10.350
It's an excellent organization.

36:10.934 --> 36:12.559
Very clean.

36:14.352 --> 36:17.436
If your mother feels she's not safe,
if you're not safe...

36:17.562 --> 36:19.478
My mother and I are both safe.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.188
Thank you.

36:56.118 --> 36:58.410
Brat! Come here.

36:58.535 --> 37:00.868
There's my girl!
Come here, come here...

37:02.620 --> 37:03.619
- Mom.
- What?

37:03.744 --> 37:05.913
I have something for you.

37:08.789 --> 37:11.331
It must have dropped out
while you were cleaning.

37:11.456 --> 37:13.873
How about that?
You see the fireworks?

37:13.999 --> 37:16.084
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Weren't they something?

37:16.583 --> 37:19.002
Hey, Brat. You know this one.

37:20.501 --> 37:22.211
Move, Tiffany.

37:26.545 --> 37:29.006
Here comes the sun

37:30.839 --> 37:34.632
Here comes the sun
And I say

37:35.133 --> 37:36.924
It's alright

37:46.094 --> 37:47.762
Little darling

37:48.346 --> 37:52.597
It's been a long, cold lonely winter

37:54.805 --> 37:56.890
Little darling

37:56.974 --> 38:01.766
It feels like years
Since it's been here

38:03.560 --> 38:05.476
Here comes the sun

38:07.893 --> 38:11.812
Here comes the sun
And I say

38:12.313 --> 38:13.689
It's alright

38:19.107 --> 38:21.441
Here comes the sun

38:23.276 --> 38:26.902
Here comes the sun
And I say

38:27.526 --> 38:29.445
It's alright

38:41.991 --> 38:43.699
The watch is old.

38:43.824 --> 38:45.868
You said we had everything.

38:45.993 --> 38:48.619
I wanted to leave it here.
You insisted that I take it.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.869
I shouldn't have to insist, Chris.

38:50.994 --> 38:53.953
If you cared about it, about me,
I wouldn't have to ask.

38:54.078 --> 38:55.455
So what? It's a broken watch.

38:55.580 --> 38:58.539
- I'll check if the maids took it.
- So it's the maids' fault?

38:58.664 --> 39:02.497
- You saw the maids. You saw them!
- Oh? You're a fricking maid!

39:02.623 --> 39:05.417
- It's different and you know it.
- How is it different?

39:05.540 --> 39:07.125
They're illegal, Chris.

39:07.250 --> 39:11.544
They come in here, work for peanuts,
and steal to supplement their income.

39:12.043 --> 39:15.419
- Do you hear yourself?
- It's true. They steal work from me.

39:15.544 --> 39:18.629
What an ugly person you are.
I cannot believe I married you!

39:18.754 --> 39:21.173
Yeah, well I can't believe
I had a kid with you,

39:21.298 --> 39:24.466
you drunk, selfish bastard!

39:29.925 --> 39:31.550
Vicky, your father...

39:33.719 --> 39:35.510
He lost his watch.

39:40.970 --> 39:41.971
Vic...

39:53.644 --> 39:55.101
You insisted that I take it.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.685
If you cared about me,
I wouldn't have to ask.

39:57.810 --> 39:59.145
It's a broken watch!

40:07.731 --> 40:10.482
What an ugly person you are.
I cannot believe I married you!

40:10.607 --> 40:12.817
Well, I can't believe
I had a kid with you,

40:12.942 --> 40:16.359
you drunk, selfish bastard!

41:25.094 --> 41:28.345
There you are. I was wondering
if you guys would come back.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.929
You know, for the watch.

41:40.974 --> 41:44.059
Oh, thank you.
That's my father's.

41:44.643 --> 41:45.560
Cool.

41:46.144 --> 41:49.187
Do you want something to drink?
You don't look so good.

41:49.977 --> 41:51.562
I just had a lot of sun.

41:52.438 --> 41:54.397
Tonic? Frappe?

41:54.522 --> 41:56.730
No. Thank you.

42:06.359 --> 42:07.944
Do you see that?

42:09.485 --> 42:12.444
- Yeah. It's real, right?
- As a frickin' heart attack.

44:05.863 --> 44:07.239
Vic?

44:09.072 --> 44:10.240
Vic?

44:18.534 --> 44:20.494
I need to lie down.

45:31.436 --> 45:32.687
I don't feel good.

45:36.022 --> 45:39.106
Your bedtime came long ago...

45:42.024 --> 45:44.151
...and went away with a yawn.

45:47.277 --> 45:49.569
Something is happening to me.

45:49.694 --> 45:51.068
Yes.

45:51.652 --> 45:53.070
Something fun.

45:54.236 --> 45:56.739
It's happening to me, too,

45:57.279 --> 45:59.948
as we dream of Christmasland
together in this...

46:00.572 --> 46:02.532
very special car.

46:04.741 --> 46:06.201
How old are you?

46:07.074 --> 46:08.451
Well...

46:09.535 --> 46:11.202
I'll give you a hint.

46:11.327 --> 46:15.537
I'm as old as my nose
and even older than my teeth.

46:18.789 --> 46:21.122
You look younger than before.

46:22.081 --> 46:25.124
Don't trouble yourself
with thoughts of that, Daniel Moore.

46:26.123 --> 46:27.708
Go back to sleep.

46:29.043 --> 46:31.752
We'll continue our journey
in the morning.

47:12.517 --> 47:14.892
Hey... Hey.

47:17.394 --> 47:19.686
Relax, Vic. Relax.

47:20.769 --> 47:22.979
Brat, it's Dad. It's Dad.

47:24.938 --> 47:26.105
OK?

47:28.147 --> 47:31.023
I dreamed there was a man.
He was...

47:32.900 --> 47:34.358
He was really scary.

47:36.858 --> 47:39.903
You got a fever.
You fainted out by the woods.

47:40.026 --> 47:42.028
You're lucky Haley was there.

47:46.904 --> 47:48.489
You hit Mom?

47:57.408 --> 47:59.118
Too much to drink.

48:03.828 --> 48:05.204
Vodka.

48:08.163 --> 48:10.455
I promise you
it will never happen again.

48:10.580 --> 48:13.206
You promised not to drink
any more vodka.

48:17.583 --> 48:18.707
Yeah. I'm sorry.

48:32.129 --> 48:34.964
- Listen...
- Oh, I found your watch.

48:37.633 --> 48:40.050
Yeah? Where was it?

48:40.676 --> 48:43.593
At Aunt Carrie's.
The bridge took me there.

48:48.177 --> 48:50.346
You're sick as a bird, here.

48:52.513 --> 48:53.639
Come on.

48:54.638 --> 48:55.764
Dad...

48:55.889 --> 48:58.765
Listen, your father's a knucklehead.

48:58.890 --> 49:00.807
And your mom is...

49:01.808 --> 49:03.641
a fricking lunatic.

49:05.852 --> 49:10.269
But you can be anything
that you want to be in this world.

49:10.853 --> 49:14.312
Don't let anybody stop you
or try to tell you different.

49:14.437 --> 49:17.230
Not Mom, not anybody, OK?

49:17.856 --> 49:18.857
OK.

49:21.566 --> 49:22.817
Alright.

49:26.316 --> 49:29.526
- Just don't get married...
- And don't have any kids.

49:39.989 --> 49:41.490
I love you, Brat.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.825
I love you too.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.163
How can I find the Wraith?

50:48.432 --> 50:49.639
Mom?

50:52.974 --> 50:54.601
Your father left.

50:59.643 --> 51:01.645
- Where did he go?
- I don't know where.

51:02.895 --> 51:05.063
I don't know why. He just left.

51:05.896 --> 51:08.023
I tried so hard to keep him.

51:09.480 --> 51:12.607
I did my best
to keep liquor out of the house...

51:14.650 --> 51:16.609
I can't compete with the bar.

51:17.985 --> 51:20.235
And I can't be 24 anymore.

51:22.235 --> 51:24.613
That's how old the last one was.

51:25.445 --> 51:26.321
Don't say that.

51:26.446 --> 51:28.529
I don't know who this one is
or why she's so...

51:28.654 --> 51:31.240
- Stop. He'd never...
- It's the truth, honey.

51:37.284 --> 51:39.242
If Dad's leaving,
I'm going with him.

51:39.367 --> 51:41.451
He doesn't want you with him.

51:42.243 --> 51:45.703
We discussed it, Vic.
He didn't leave me, he left us both.

51:47.455 --> 51:48.954
You're wrong.

53:23.407 --> 53:24.949
It's snowing.

53:26.700 --> 53:29.576
It's always snowing
on the Saint Nick Parkway.

53:54.710 --> 53:56.627
Are we almost at Christmasland?

53:56.752 --> 53:58.671
Our very next stop.

53:59.711 --> 54:03.797
I'll drop you with the other children
before I head out on my errands.

54:03.922 --> 54:05.507
I hate errands.

54:06.547 --> 54:09.048
You'll have none whatsoever
in Christmasland.

54:09.674 --> 54:12.549
Only rides and games and fun.

54:13.717 --> 54:15.926
Have you ever played
Scissors for the Drifter?

54:16.051 --> 54:17.386
No.

54:17.511 --> 54:19.260
The children will teach you.

54:19.386 --> 54:23.012
And I'll see you again
when I return from a faraway place

54:23.429 --> 54:25.805
called Haverhill, Massachusetts.
