00:03.003 --> 00:05.463
"'Twas the night before Christmas,

00:05.463 --> 00:07.215
and all through the house

00:07.716 --> 00:12.012
Not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse

00:13.638 --> 00:14.889
The stockings were hung..."

00:14.889 --> 00:16.808
"Stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

00:18.685 --> 00:21.813
In hopes that St. Nicholas
soon would be there

00:23.898 --> 00:26.484
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds

00:26.484 --> 00:29.654
While visions of sugar plums
danced in their heads"

00:34.451 --> 00:40.123
A little bit of this,
and a little poof of that.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.750
Ooh.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.753
Hoopiddy, doopiddy, hoopiddy,
doopiddy, hoopiddy, gah!

00:45.295 --> 00:47.756
I love soup season!

00:48.256 --> 00:49.257
Mmm.

00:52.802 --> 00:56.306
The Calvins are back!

00:56.306 --> 01:00.852
Oh, Mr. Coat,
it is time for you to go home!

01:03.229 --> 01:04.230
What?

01:09.486 --> 01:10.570
Uh-oh!

01:16.076 --> 01:20.288
It's a sneaky, sneaky, sneaky coat.

01:44.562 --> 01:45.772
How did a horse get here?

01:48.316 --> 01:49.943
Find whoever was in this thing!

01:51.069 --> 01:53.113
His drones are so cool.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.574
I mean, they would be,

01:56.574 --> 01:59.285
if they weren't being used
to try to destroy everything good.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.537
You chew so loudly.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.001
Okay, let's go help your dad.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.045
Be careful and don't get caught.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.839
Only suckers get caught!

02:11.506 --> 02:18.054
That's when I realized
I just let the love of my life fly away.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.515
It got so dark.

02:20.515 --> 02:25.979
Trust me, it only gets worse.
The year? 1691--

02:25.979 --> 02:29.315
No, no, the Christmas Spirit Orb.
Did you see how dark it was getting?

02:29.315 --> 02:32.277
Speaking of seeing, you're probably
wondering what happened to my eye.

02:32.277 --> 02:36.447
No. Did you notice Simon didn't
even look like Santa Claus?

02:36.447 --> 02:39.409
He didn't have that gorgeous belly,
the beard and everything.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.162
That means the Santa-fication process
hasn't begun.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.664
He hasn't put the coat on yet!

02:44.664 --> 02:46.916
- He hasn't put the coat on.
- I just said that.

02:46.916 --> 02:51.045
No, I'm telling you,
he lost the coat his very first day.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.464
It was a whole hullabaloo.

02:53.464 --> 02:54.757
That's how we fix this.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.844
He's not officially Santa
without the coat on.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.722
So we just find that coat,
we can change all of this.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.731
Do you think that drone can hear us?

03:10.773 --> 03:12.150
Hey, drone!

03:12.150 --> 03:16.070
Did you hear our plan about getting to
the Santa coat before Simon does?

03:18.740 --> 03:19.741
Yeah, it heard.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.618
Really?

03:21.618 --> 03:25.330
<i>Whoever controls the Santa coat,
controls the North Pole.</i>

03:25.330 --> 03:26.414
Oh, that stupid coat.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.042
Uh, thank you, EN-52,
you've been most helpful.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.793
<i>I'm EN-51.</i>

03:31.878 --> 03:34.464
Drones, bring me the Santa coat.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.383
Daddy!

03:37.383 --> 03:39.802
- I got you something!
- Hey, not now, sweetie. Okay?

03:39.802 --> 03:42.430
Daddy is this close to getting
everything he's ever wanted.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.723
We've ever wanted.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.602
Don't you already have everything?
I mean, you're Santa Claus.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.563
Listen, honey. There's nothing wrong
with wanting more. All right?

03:50.563 --> 03:52.857
Daddy wants to be bigger than Santa Claus.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.318
But there are these bad guys
that are trying to stop him.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.778
Why don't you do me a favor?

03:56.778 --> 03:59.572
Go to your room and stay there.
Stay there until this is all over.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.866
But-- But maybe if they saw my gift,

04:01.866 --> 04:04.744
they wouldn't be bad anymore
and believe in the magic of Christmas.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.537
Hey, will you just go?

04:06.537 --> 04:09.040
I'm so sick of hearing about
the magic of Christmas!

04:13.294 --> 04:20.176
<i>♪ We wish you a Betty Christmas
We wish you a Betty Christmas ♪</i>

04:20.176 --> 04:26.557
<i>♪ We wish you a Betty Christmas
And a Betty New Year ♪</i>

04:26.557 --> 04:27.892
- Um?
- Aw.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.143
- Watch your head.
- Hmm?

04:29.143 --> 04:30.853
Yep.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.022
- Okay. Okay.
- Just used to real-world doors.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.190
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.443
Noel, we came to help you save Christmas.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.487
Who cares about Christmas?

04:40.071 --> 04:42.573
Betty's gone and there are no more elves.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.575
Oh, sweetheart, I am so sorry,

04:44.575 --> 04:46.619
but you have to believe
we can get them back.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.997
Noel, we can't find my dad anywhere.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.709
He's-- He's close. I can-- I can sense it.
But I feel he's trapped.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.254
Trapped? [distorted] Not my Santa!

04:56.254 --> 04:58.172
All right. Let's go. Follow me.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.257
Head!

04:59.257 --> 05:02.135
- All right. All right.
- You're all right. Okay.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.278
Scott! Thank goodness.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.822
- I thought you were being tortured.
- I am being tortured. I am.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.741
But it's so good to see all of you!

05:24.741 --> 05:27.410
Some of us more than others though, right?
You don't have to say who.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.619
How di-- How did you get here?

05:28.619 --> 05:32.415
Your Santa ghost friends were right.
We do have powers.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.667
I knew it! I knew it.
Well, use your powers.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.210
- Can you get us outta here?
- No.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.547
But Sandra can speak to animals,
and I can see holes in the sky.

05:39.547 --> 05:43.676
Uh, fun, interesting, anti-climagic
'cause we're still stuck in here.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.220
You know you could just eat your way out?

05:46.220 --> 05:47.805
The bars are made of licorice.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.934
Why didn't you tell me that?

05:51.934 --> 05:53.978
I thought we were bonding.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.190
Bonding? With my Santa?

05:58.107 --> 06:00.068
Hey, hey. Hey, Noel, Noel!

06:00.068 --> 06:02.487
Buddy. Noel, Noel! Buddy!

06:04.822 --> 06:06.949
Noel, you nitwit!

06:06.949 --> 06:10.244
I promise I will come back and haunt you!

06:10.244 --> 06:12.663
Look, your dumb hat didn't even work.

06:12.663 --> 06:13.998
You're still here.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.961
Oh.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.797
- Oh, no.
- Okay.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.924
We can all point fingers later.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.425
But first...

06:26.677 --> 06:27.804
<i>bon appétit</i>.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.269
Come here, coat!

06:36.396 --> 06:40.733
Come out, come out, wherever you are,
you stupid, idiotic coat!

06:42.318 --> 06:43.569
Hey, drones, um.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.114
I'll give a million dollars
to the drone who finds the coat.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.865
<i>Money has no meaning to us.</i>

06:47.865 --> 06:49.242
Stupid drones.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.453
<i>Your finger was on the button,
so we heard that.</i>

06:52.453 --> 06:55.248
Sorry. Hey, uh, any sign of the intruders?

06:55.248 --> 06:59.836
<i>No. But if you need
foot soldiers, we know where to find some.</i>

07:02.672 --> 07:03.714
Foot soldiers?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.535
- Oh.
- There we go.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.329
- Not bad. Thank you, everybody.
- Mm-hmm.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.458
- Easy as pie, right?
- That was not as easy as pie.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.376
I'm gonna need about ten minutes.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.670
Really? I've been getting hungrier.

07:43.379 --> 07:44.380
- I like it.
- Huh.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.507
Hey, look, the key was right here.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.050
- Noel!
- Noel!

07:48.050 --> 07:49.760
You looked everywhere but on the desk?

07:49.760 --> 07:52.638
- Really?
- All right. We gotta find the coat.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.307
It's close by. I can-- I can feel it.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.225
I know, me too.
I was just thinking about that.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.311
You and I gotta have a conversation
about this, but not now.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.021
Most important thing is to find that coat.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.982
And I say we'd do better
if we all split up. Let's go.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.109
- Oh, no.
- Dibs on Santa Scott!

08:06.986 --> 08:08.946
Ooh!
Are there any red licorice jail cells?

08:09.572 --> 08:10.948
Oh, those would be so good.

08:11.991 --> 08:12.992
Ooh!

08:15.036 --> 08:16.287
Oh, wow.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.041
Okay.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.048
Sandra, is that you?

08:27.048 --> 08:29.133
Yes, yes, it's really me, Lewis.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.635
You understand me?

08:30.635 --> 08:35.389
I've always understood you,
but yes, I can talk to animals now.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.685
Which is both a dream and a nightmare
because some of y'all talk a lot.

08:39.685 --> 08:40.853
Mm-mmm.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.897
Anyways, I really do wanna catch up.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.651
But first I need your help finding
the Santa coat before Simon gets it

08:46.651 --> 08:47.860
and ruins Christmas.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.445
- Okay.
- Come on.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.239
- Come on, Lewis.
- Coming!

08:51.239 --> 08:52.323
Let's go.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.503
Oh?

09:06.504 --> 09:07.505
Oh, hey, fellas.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.340
<i>Tell us where the coat is or we'll shoot.</i>

09:09.340 --> 09:14.303
I-I don't know where it is,
but I-I can kinda feel it's nearby, but--

09:15.721 --> 09:20.184
Just like how I feel
that you're not bad drones.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.520
You're-- You're just programmed that way.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.897
<i>Do not try to distract us
with tender feelings.</i>

09:24.897 --> 09:26.816
Sorry you feel this way.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.194
You were built to deliver joy
to this world.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.448
It-- It must be difficult.
No drone deserves that.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.200
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:37.410 --> 09:38.703
Thank you.

09:46.711 --> 09:51.674
Hey!
Oh, I remember you and your dumb faces!

09:53.593 --> 09:57.513
<i>Nothing to worry about.
This unknown woman poses no threat.</i>

09:57.513 --> 10:00.433
Unknown woman?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.935
How dare you.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.066
Ah.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.486
Oh, no.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.325
Do you know who I am?

10:17.325 --> 10:18.701
Ha!

10:28.961 --> 10:33.466
They call me Mrs. Claus!

10:38.095 --> 10:39.180
Okay.

10:41.098 --> 10:44.393
Living in the real world has been
an eye-opening experience.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.730
And I learned that everyone
is going through something.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.651
So, the best you can do
is just to sit back and listen.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.361
So, go ahead.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.781
<i>You get built and then you wind up
at the North Pole,</i>

10:56.781 --> 10:59.200
<i>and you think you hit the jackpot.</i>

10:59.200 --> 11:03.204
-<i>But-- But--</i>
- It's okay, little buddy. I know.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.539
- Let it out. Yeah.
- What the--

11:07.458 --> 11:09.126
A-Are you talking to the drones?

11:09.126 --> 11:11.629
They prefer UAVs, but yeah.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.589
We're here to find the coat.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.800
<i>We can help you find the coat.</i>

11:15.800 --> 11:16.717
Huh?

11:16.717 --> 11:17.718
You turned them friendly?

11:17.718 --> 11:19.804
They're very considerate
when you get to know them.

11:23.307 --> 11:24.350
The coat!

11:25.184 --> 11:26.435
It's here!

11:37.780 --> 11:39.782
Whoa, whoa. Hey, what happened here?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.159
The Chicago way.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.120
Dad! There's the coat.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.871
Oh, my gosh.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.312
What the smoke monster?

12:10.312 --> 12:12.106
Where have I seen this before?

12:12.106 --> 12:13.232
I know what this is.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.986
It is me, La Befana!

12:16.986 --> 12:19.363
Also, I am very dizzy.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.699
Ha!

12:22.324 --> 12:24.660
Later.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.372
- <i>Oops. My bad.</i>
- Okay.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.458
- La Befana.
- Son of a biscotti!

12:31.917 --> 12:33.335
Thank you, nutty witch lady.

12:33.335 --> 12:36.130
- Oh.
- So, Scott, help me understand.

12:36.130 --> 12:40.593
You need this dusty old coat
so that you can become Santa

12:40.593 --> 12:43.554
- and drive me out of business, huh?
- No, no, no. Don't do that.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.348
You destroy that coat,
you-you-you'll kill Christmas.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.892
- Kill it?
- Yeah!

12:47.892 --> 12:50.060
Really? I'm the good guy here, okay?

12:50.060 --> 12:52.062
I single-handedly saved Christmas

12:52.062 --> 12:54.857
by allowing people to get everything
they want every day.

12:54.857 --> 12:59.528
It's not about getting,
it-it's about the giving.

12:59.528 --> 13:02.448
I think you're worried
that when people hear "Christmas,"

13:02.448 --> 13:04.658
they're gonna remember my name, not yours.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.704
All right. You know what?
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.498
You actually still think
you're a nice guy?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.458
To the fireplace with you.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.293
Daddy?

13:16.253 --> 13:17.421
Are you the bad guy?

13:18.005 --> 13:20.341
What? No. No, Grace.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.510
I'm-I'm creating something better for us.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.386
Okay, honey? This is all for you.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.096
And no, he's not a bad guy.

13:26.889 --> 13:30.267
Even the best dads can lose our way.

13:31.310 --> 13:37.274
Grace, what would be
the best possible Christmas gift to you?

13:38.359 --> 13:41.654
To spend time with my dad.
He barely has time for me anymore.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.738
Hey...

13:44.824 --> 13:49.119
I think you're just about to give him
the best gift ever.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.922
If you shake it, it shows
your favorite Christmas memories.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.134
Oh, honey.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.055
That's the first Christmas after Mom, uh--

14:10.391 --> 14:13.185
I didn't know what I was doing,
so I tried to do everything.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.311
We were together.

14:14.311 --> 14:16.480
That's when I knew we were gonna be okay.

14:18.107 --> 14:22.027
Promise me, here,
you'll give Grace the best life.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.988
Oh, come on. I'm gonna give her the world.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.657
She needs a dad. That's all.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.705
Yeah, you-- you're right.
Grace needs a dad.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.966
Grace. I'm sorry, honey. I'm so, so sorry.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.468
Can you ever forgive me?

14:48.429 --> 14:51.432
If you give the coat back
to the real Santa.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.060
Oh? You mean this coat?

14:58.647 --> 15:00.024
Where's the Orb? Where's the Orb?

15:00.024 --> 15:01.984
Uh, I-- I don't know. I lost it somewhere.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.862
Oh, God. Come on! We gotta find that Orb.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.656
Oh, guys!

15:07.656 --> 15:09.533
Come on. Look for the Orb.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.577
Whoa. Mrs. John Wick was here.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.454
Well, I have some untapped emotion.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.872
No. No. No.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.000
Oh, no.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.168
- Oh.
- I'm too late.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.003
This is all my fault.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.632
If you mean going loco
and almost destroying Christmas, yes.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.467
But this is on me.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.722
I let a slight hardship
get the better of me.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.100
I became aware that the world's
becoming more challenging,

15:35.100 --> 15:37.686
and instead of stepping up,
I stepped down.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.272
How do you expect other people
to hold on to the Christmas Spirit

15:40.272 --> 15:42.441
when I let it go myself?

15:43.901 --> 15:45.319
The buck stops here.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.196
Oh, right, uh, uh, sorry.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.573
Speaking of the buck,
the reindeer stopped flying.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.033
Not good timing.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.368
- I'm on a roll.
- Okay.

15:52.368 --> 15:57.748
It took moving to the real world
to know what Santa meant to me.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.917
And I took that gift, and worse yet,

16:00.668 --> 16:03.629
the gift of this beautiful family
and the magic here, for granted.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.880
Oh, Scott.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.257
- I did.
- Oh, Dad. Dad. Dad.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.344
Noel, you're in this family. Come on.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.847
Oh, La Befana, come on!

16:13.847 --> 16:15.099
Oh!

16:15.099 --> 16:17.601
Choksis, both of you. Let's go. Let's go.

16:17.601 --> 16:21.021
It's the best we could do.
The best we could.

16:21.605 --> 16:22.815
We tried.

16:26.193 --> 16:29.154
- Whoa! Something wild is happening.
- Yeah, I can feel it.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.781
- Stand back, stand back.
- Me too.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.832
Gary! [chuckles] You're alive!

16:39.832 --> 16:41.458
I'll pie you!

16:41.458 --> 16:42.501
Uh-oh!

16:43.127 --> 16:44.461
Come here!

16:48.215 --> 16:51.218
Crouton! You're back!

16:51.218 --> 16:52.678
Sandra!

16:52.678 --> 16:55.180
You can hang me on your bedroom wall
for all I care.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.391
Just promise me you'll never leave again!

16:57.891 --> 16:58.892
Come here.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.772
Edie! There you are.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.275
- Who's Edie?
- What?

17:06.275 --> 17:10.779
- Just kidding.
- Aw, oh, sweetheart, hi.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.579
Let me get this straight.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.830
Yeah?

17:19.830 --> 17:25.002
Your husband went to this Yule-verse,
and it was all the Santas.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.296
- That's what he said.
- All men?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.006
- Uh-huh.
- Wow!

17:29.006 --> 17:30.090
Yeah.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.259
I hear ya, sister.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.679
Betty?

17:36.638 --> 17:37.639
Betty?

17:41.685 --> 17:43.020
Has anyone seen Betty?

17:45.606 --> 17:46.607
Betty?

17:52.988 --> 17:55.240
- Sweet Pea?
- Caramel Cone!

17:55.240 --> 17:57.242
- Puddin' Pie!
- Gum Drop.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.619
Jelly Bean!

17:58.619 --> 18:00.704
- Snickerdoodle!
- Sugar Pie!

18:00.704 --> 18:01.872
Honey Bunch!

18:09.254 --> 18:12.132
That's for leaving me in the first place
and making me feel sadness.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.051
I'm sorry, Betty.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.553
I never thought
you'd lose Christmas Spirit.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.848
You are my Christmas Spirit, Noel.

18:24.394 --> 18:25.938
Sir, you came back

18:25.938 --> 18:29.399
even though the Secessus Clause explicitly
states invoking it is permanent.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.778
I was hoping you'd make an exception.

18:36.031 --> 18:36.990
Oh!

18:36.990 --> 18:38.867
- Wow.
- Thank you for coming back, sir.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.953
It's my honor and my privilege.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.913
We have three hours till Christmas.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.582
Didn't take long.
Already busting my snowballs.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.667
Let's go.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.254
You all know what happens
when I put on this coat.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.964
You become Santa again.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.348
- Put on the coat, Dad!
- Yes, Dad. Yes.

19:27.082 --> 19:31.128
There he is.
There's my big, strong, hunky Santa.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.546
Hey!

19:32.546 --> 19:33.672
Gross, Mom!

19:34.256 --> 19:37.009
You know, I used to think being Santa
was a one-man job,

19:37.009 --> 19:39.344
but that's not the way Christmas works.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.180
Christmas is about togetherness
and community.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.806
Spreading hope and joy.

19:43.765 --> 19:47.895
And tonight we're gonna remind
the world of that.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.855
This is bad timing,

19:49.855 --> 19:53.192
but I was thinking I might
stay behind tonight. With Betty.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.109
Oh.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.986
I think that's great timing.

19:55.986 --> 20:00.073
And I'm gonna be fine,
'cause I'm gonna do this with my team.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.702
Oh, you're serious.
You want us to go with you?

20:03.702 --> 20:04.953
- All of us?
- Yeah.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.288
Oh, yes!

20:06.288 --> 20:09.166
Um, can we buzz over
the elk reserve in Wyoming?

20:09.791 --> 20:10.876
Can we what?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.295
- I'm already ready.
- Oh, no, no.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.632
What I meant by my team
was my team. My family.

20:16.632 --> 20:20.344
Oh, I guess you and I have a very
different definition of the word team.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.846
Well, there's no I in the word team.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.556
There's no U in tomorrow.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.726
Okay. Um, all right.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.394
We need all hands on deck.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.438
Sandra, can't believe
I'm about to say this.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.440
I want you to talk to the reindeer.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.859
Get 'em flying again.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.694
Cal, your apprentice program
starts tonight.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.113
I want you to make sure
that bag's full of gifts.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.573
Okay, let's move.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.371
Uh, so, these things still work, right?

20:47.371 --> 20:49.790
If you shake 'em, they show
your favorite Christmas memories?

20:49.790 --> 20:50.874
Yes.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.919
Sweet, then I'd like to take
some snow globes to go.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.713
Okay, [sighs] which ones?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.466
All of 'em.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.177
I put Simon and Grace to sleep
and sent them bye-bye.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.264
Once again, Edie,
you need a better choice of words.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.765
Oh, right. Um...

21:06.765 --> 21:07.891
They're safely back home.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.518
- Thanks.
- Great. Where's Cal?

21:17.150 --> 21:18.443
- No.
- What?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.238
- Is it too much?
- Too much.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.115
Don't leave without me!
I've got the gifts!

21:23.115 --> 21:25.659
- That's embarrassing.
- We'll meet him in the sleigh. Come on.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.161
All systems go.
Everyone at their stations?

21:29.496 --> 21:30.622
All right, everyone.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.084
We are back in business.

21:38.630 --> 21:42.634
Woo-hoo!

21:42.634 --> 21:45.387
I'm still not loving it,
but I'll get used to it.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.264
It's everything I've ever dreamed of.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.765
On, Dancer! On, Prancer!

21:48.765 --> 21:52.519
Actually, Dad, they prefer to be called
Chopper, Razor, the Hoofster,

21:52.519 --> 21:55.981
Atomic, Hotshot, Prettyboy,
Airbender, and Steve.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.316
And Steve.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.237
To the left and-and higher,
higher, higher, higher.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.197
Cal, thank you, but I've done this before.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.282
Oh, okay.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.840
Okay, last stop of the night, everybody.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.550
- Oh, guys. Come on, wake up.
- Wake up.

22:23.550 --> 22:27.721
Cal, I'm a little wiped out right now.
So I'm gonna need your help on this one.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.264
- Really, me?
- Yeah.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.349
Is that even legal?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.850
Well, we won't tell Betty.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.062
<i>Betty knows, and Betty approves.</i>

22:46.865 --> 22:48.158
Soot!

22:48.158 --> 22:49.242
Cal?

22:50.243 --> 22:52.371
Oh, no. No, not Cal.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.290
Just a confused old man
looking for his home.

22:55.290 --> 22:58.585
Buddy Cal Calvin, what are you doing?

22:59.252 --> 23:00.545
I'm sorry.

23:02.923 --> 23:07.052
My-My dad didn't tell me
that this was your house.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.515
I'm sort of his Santa-in-training.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.518
Um, but...

23:15.268 --> 23:18.563
Just as promised, m'Riley.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.316
For your brother.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.152
Okay.

23:24.152 --> 23:27.114
But these are for you.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.452
For you.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.872
I can't believe you.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.377
Riley, hey, I don't know what to say.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.254
Poinsettias are my favorite.

23:44.005 --> 23:48.301
I-I am so sorry about lying before, but--

23:57.352 --> 23:59.271
This is the best night of my life.

24:00.814 --> 24:04.109
Mine too. Except for less pervy reasons.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.736
Cal, did you remember to make sure
she didn't remember?

24:06.736 --> 24:08.029
Did you remember?

24:08.947 --> 24:10.615
Yeah. I remembered. Yeah.

24:11.324 --> 24:12.492
What could go wrong?

24:15.036 --> 24:17.247
- It looks like I made good on my promise.
- Mm-hmm.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.916
Twenty years later,
we're finally having Christmas together.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.294
When you put it that way...

24:22.294 --> 24:24.171
No! I'm kidding.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.132
It's so beautiful.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.468
Okay. What's so funny?

24:30.635 --> 24:35.056
Everybody's waking up now with something
they didn't ask for under their tree.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.892
What have we done?

25:21.686 --> 25:23.522
- Sir?
- Hello, Betty. What's up?

25:23.522 --> 25:27.359
Only 364 days until Christmas,
and we're already behind schedule.
