00:11.275 --> 00:16.012
Shoot, there's something I've been
trying to remember for the past few days.

00:16.046 --> 00:18.681
Was it that I'm halfway
between birthdays

00:18.716 --> 00:21.084
and you wanted to bake
me a half-birthday cake?

00:21.552 --> 00:22.886
That's a full cake.

00:22.921 --> 00:24.788
Don't let the word
"half" trick you.

00:25.222 --> 00:27.357
Daddy, stop trying to
take advantage of her.

00:27.391 --> 00:29.059
Hey, she lives here now.

00:29.093 --> 00:32.028
I can exploit her just like I
exploit the rest of you people.

00:33.631 --> 00:35.065
Sorry about that, Harper.

00:35.099 --> 00:36.499
But out of curiosity,

00:36.534 --> 00:38.501
were you gonna get me
a flat screen TV

00:38.536 --> 00:41.538
I could mount onto the ceiling?
I really hate sitting up.

00:41.572 --> 00:45.175
No, I don't think it...
Wait a minute.

00:46.310 --> 00:49.713
TV... TV...

00:49.747 --> 00:52.782
Oh, no fair!
You're gonna get a TV!

00:55.386 --> 00:59.189
TV... Stevie.

00:59.223 --> 01:02.692
Stevie! I think it had
something to do with Stevie.

01:02.727 --> 01:04.794
Our friend Stevie?

01:04.828 --> 01:07.764
Oh, was it that I wanted to borrow
her cute boots and that shredded top?

01:07.798 --> 01:10.200
I thought you were allergic
to other people's clothes.

01:10.234 --> 01:12.902
That's why you never
borrow mine.

01:12.937 --> 01:15.772
Why don't you jog her memory
with the "Jog Your Memory" spell?

01:15.806 --> 01:17.440
Oh, that's what
that spell does?

01:17.475 --> 01:19.109
I saw the word "jog"
and I bailed.

01:21.112 --> 01:22.712
<i>Do what you say
Say what you mean.</i>

01:22.747 --> 01:24.581
<i>One thing leads to another.
Remember!</i>

01:26.484 --> 01:29.619
I remember! Stevie took out
her wand and did a spell.

01:29.653 --> 01:30.854
She's a wizard!

01:30.888 --> 01:33.089
Oh, my gosh!
Stevie's a wizard?!

01:33.124 --> 01:36.159
Quick, Harper.
Bake a cake to celebrate.

01:37.294 --> 01:39.729
And just so we're clear,
that's two cakes.

As your student body
president, people,

02:43.027 --> 02:46.329
I'm happy to announce that we
are now accepting volunteers

02:46.363 --> 02:49.566
to help build this year's
homecoming float, everyone!

02:55.005 --> 02:56.906
Hey, this may be
your only chance

02:56.941 --> 02:59.943
you ever get to build
a homecoming float.

02:59.977 --> 03:03.112
Well, unless your job is
professional float maker.

03:03.147 --> 03:04.747
I need to go see
the guidance counselor.

03:07.184 --> 03:08.651
I'm not signing up
for your stupid thing.

03:08.686 --> 03:10.820
I wouldn't want you
to help anyway.

03:13.057 --> 03:16.926
All right. There's Stevie.
We have to be careful.

03:16.961 --> 03:19.529
We can't just come right out
and ask her if she's a wizard.

03:19.563 --> 03:22.332
Okay.
I'll follow your lead.

03:24.068 --> 03:27.070
Hey, Stevie. Harper wants
to know if you're a wizard.

03:27.104 --> 03:30.273
- What?
- She didn't finish.

03:30.307 --> 03:32.075
What she meant to say was...

03:33.577 --> 03:36.579
...are you a wizard...

03:37.281 --> 03:40.416
...of... Oz?

03:42.987 --> 03:44.487
I'm not good at this.

03:44.522 --> 03:46.222
Oh, who cares?

03:46.257 --> 03:48.658
If anything goes wrong,
I'll just erase her brain.

03:48.692 --> 03:51.694
Did you just say something
about erasing people's brains?

03:51.729 --> 03:54.631
Well, that depends.

03:54.665 --> 03:57.233
Do you find the idea
of brain erasing

03:57.268 --> 04:00.403
ridiculous
or un-ridiculous?

04:00.437 --> 04:02.739
I find it ridiculous
that you would think

04:02.773 --> 04:06.009
that I would find it
un-ridiculous.

04:07.244 --> 04:09.245
As I hear people say
all the time,

04:09.280 --> 04:12.515
and cannot spell,
"touchÃ©."

04:14.451 --> 04:17.754
Yep, that's right.
I'm a wizard.

04:17.788 --> 04:19.822
Okay, before I get
too excited about this,

04:19.857 --> 04:21.958
would you be terribly offended
if I asked you to prove it?

04:21.992 --> 04:26.329
- Not at all. - She keeps her
wand in her boot! I do that, too!

04:33.771 --> 04:36.072
Oh, my gosh,
now I'm excited!

04:36.106 --> 04:37.974
Harper, she's a wizard!

04:38.008 --> 04:40.376
Wait a minute, where did
that hole lead to?

04:40.411 --> 04:41.778
I have no idea.

04:41.812 --> 04:44.447
Oh, my gosh. I love
irresponsible magic.

04:44.481 --> 04:46.482
That's pretty much
the only kind I use.

04:48.919 --> 04:51.588
But that was
Jeremy from Science.

04:55.025 --> 04:57.293
He was about
to ask me out.

04:59.463 --> 05:01.864
- Harper?
- And now we'll never know.

05:04.335 --> 05:07.470
This is so great. I can't
believe that you're a wizard too.

05:07.504 --> 05:09.138
Finally,
someone who gets me.

05:09.173 --> 05:10.707
All right,
does it bother you

05:10.741 --> 05:12.475
how wizards
are portrayed on TV?

05:12.509 --> 05:14.811
We have the long beards
and the pointy hats.

05:14.845 --> 05:16.879
Nah, it's fun. Watch.

05:28.859 --> 05:30.727
Hey, this is fun.

05:32.896 --> 05:34.631
Hey, look,
I'm a wizard.

05:40.104 --> 05:41.838
Harper,
that's offensive.

05:44.508 --> 05:47.243
Hey, so have you seen
the new issue of Wiz Beat?

05:47.277 --> 05:49.112
"I want the puzzles."

05:49.146 --> 05:50.713
Hey, Harper.

05:50.748 --> 05:53.349
It looks like Stevie and Alex
are getting pretty close.

05:53.384 --> 05:55.485
They're not
getting close.

05:55.519 --> 05:57.587
They're just excited 'cause they
found out they're both wizards.

05:57.621 --> 05:59.389
Stevie's a wizard?

06:00.257 --> 06:01.924
That explains the hat.

06:03.594 --> 06:05.862
What about the beard?

06:05.896 --> 06:07.630
Harper, that's offensive.

06:10.668 --> 06:13.536
She's even more like
Alex than I thought.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.738
This is not good.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.208
What do you mean?

06:19.243 --> 06:21.811
Non-wizard friends can't
compete with wizard friends.

06:21.845 --> 06:23.346
I mean, think about it.

06:23.380 --> 06:27.016
Stevie and Alex can go on wonderful
magical adventures together.

06:27.051 --> 06:28.551
What can you two do?

06:28.585 --> 06:31.721
Text each other from
opposite sides of the couch?

06:31.755 --> 06:34.490
Hey, it goes from my phone to
outer space back to her phone.

06:34.525 --> 06:36.826
- That's pretty magical.
- Okay...

06:38.562 --> 06:40.029
Harper, I hate
to tell you this,

06:40.064 --> 06:41.898
but I think you're in danger
of becoming a third wheel.

06:41.932 --> 06:44.233
That's ridiculous.

06:44.268 --> 06:46.436
Nothing could ever affect
my relationship with Alex.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.871
In fact, all three of us are
about to go to lunch together.

06:51.942 --> 06:55.712
All right, I will
meet you guys there.

06:55.746 --> 06:57.513
I don't want
to keep them waiting.

07:02.252 --> 07:05.188
All right, Zeke. You and I are
the entire homecoming committee.

07:06.657 --> 07:08.691
I guess it's up to us.
Um, um...

07:08.726 --> 07:11.027
We need a theme
for our float.

07:11.061 --> 07:12.328
Robots!

07:13.564 --> 07:16.165
Not everything we do has
to be robot-themed, Zeke.

07:17.835 --> 07:20.369
How about... I got it,
just came to me...

07:20.404 --> 07:22.538
"Tahitian Fantasy Cruise"?

07:22.573 --> 07:24.974
Hmmm. Exotic.
Aspirational.

07:25.008 --> 07:27.043
- Coconuts. I love it.
- Yes!

07:28.045 --> 07:30.379
Wait, are you serious?

07:30.414 --> 07:32.248
Tahitian Fantasy Cruise?

07:32.282 --> 07:34.150
That's the best
you could come up with?

07:34.184 --> 07:37.086
And why do you care?

07:37.121 --> 07:39.555
Because I'm gonna
have to listen to you

07:39.590 --> 07:42.425
talk about it
for the rest of your life.

07:42.459 --> 07:45.027
Hey, how about
"Friends Forever"?

07:45.062 --> 07:47.430
It's a theme
and a life philosophy.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.834
How about this
for a theme:

07:51.869 --> 07:55.505
"High School...
Tick Tock, Let Me Out."

07:57.341 --> 08:00.343
Now, that's a theme.
I vote for that one.

08:00.377 --> 08:02.278
I'm with Alex...

08:02.312 --> 08:04.280
...as always.

08:06.583 --> 08:09.018
All right. Fine.

08:09.052 --> 08:10.686
We'll go with
Stevie's theme.

08:10.721 --> 08:12.321
And since you all voted,

08:12.356 --> 08:14.524
that officially makes you
a part of our committee.

08:14.558 --> 08:16.259
So you're helping.

08:16.293 --> 08:18.394
Excellent! Good.

08:19.763 --> 08:22.398
Zeke, it looks like the float
will proceed as planned.

08:22.432 --> 08:23.966
That's great!
I'm gonna go get started

08:24.001 --> 08:26.102
on the float
entertainment right now.

08:26.136 --> 08:28.704
- No robots.
- Aw, man!

08:30.073 --> 08:31.574
I'm walking out
as a robot anyway.

08:51.528 --> 08:55.798
Well, I think we've put in
enough time for today, don't you?

08:55.833 --> 08:58.668
No, no! We just started.
We haven't done anything.

08:58.702 --> 09:01.270
Come on, we've put
a tarp on plywood.

09:01.305 --> 09:02.872
That's it! That's all.

09:04.408 --> 09:05.875
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin.

09:05.909 --> 09:07.810
But Stevie and I
need to do something

09:07.845 --> 09:10.112
that takes advantage of
our new magical friendship.

09:10.147 --> 09:12.782
And putting wet paper
on chicken wire is magical.

09:12.816 --> 09:14.050
Let me show you!

09:15.018 --> 09:16.953
Hey, we should
go to Sled Mountain.

09:16.987 --> 09:21.023
I hear they have the only sledding hills
in the entire wizard world that go uphill.

09:21.058 --> 09:23.359
That's the exact opposite
direction they're supposed to go.

09:23.393 --> 09:26.429
- That is so magical. -
Mm-hmm. I'll race you there.

09:27.931 --> 09:30.433
No! Alex, you can't leave.
We're counting on you to help.

09:30.467 --> 09:33.302
Relax, Justin.
Harper's gonna be here.

09:33.337 --> 09:36.205
It's like my homework. She'll be
doing my share of the work anyway.

09:40.110 --> 09:44.380
Wow. Alex is really
taking advantage of you.

09:44.414 --> 09:47.116
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, don't be.

09:47.150 --> 09:49.652
I've only been doing her
homework at about a "D" level.

09:52.189 --> 09:55.157
Harper, it's gonna be cold on Sled
Mountain. Can I borrow your sweater?

09:55.192 --> 09:56.893
Oh, okay.

09:57.861 --> 09:58.861
Great. See ya!

10:00.597 --> 10:02.865
I know what that looks like,
but that was a one-time thing.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.134
Alex and I
are still like this.

10:06.770 --> 10:09.005
Harper, can I borrow
ten bucks?

10:10.540 --> 10:13.075
- All I have is a 20 dollars bill.
- Perfect. Thanks!

10:15.112 --> 10:18.214
Oh, my gosh,
you were right!

10:18.248 --> 10:20.049
I am the third wheel.

10:20.083 --> 10:23.286
- Harper...
- Oh, no, this is bad.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.521
That doesn't even
make me feel better.

10:28.225 --> 10:30.693
No, no, no.
Leave it there.

10:42.025 --> 10:43.125
Hey, Harper.

10:44.261 --> 10:47.129
What's wrong?

10:47.164 --> 10:50.833
You look like you could use some
good old-fashioned fatherly advice.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.435
That would be nice.

10:53.470 --> 10:55.604
Do you want me
to call your dad?

10:57.707 --> 11:00.743
I'm sorry.

11:00.777 --> 11:02.044
What's the problem?

11:02.078 --> 11:05.147
Alex would rather hang out
with Stevie than me.

11:05.182 --> 11:07.082
I've become a third wheel.

11:07.117 --> 11:09.084
A third wheel, huh?

11:09.119 --> 11:12.188
Maybe it'll make you feel better
if you think about it like this:

11:12.222 --> 11:14.990
A table can't even stand
without a third wheel.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.862
Tables don't have wheels.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.832
You know, if you
weren't so critical,

11:23.867 --> 11:27.236
maybe people would want
to hang out with you more.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.842
Oh, my gosh.
I am too critical.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.978
I've driven Alex away.

11:36.012 --> 11:38.714
No. No, no, I didn't
mean it like that. Um...

11:38.748 --> 11:41.450
You know, I was
a third wheel once, too.

11:41.484 --> 11:44.320
Me, John Bender
and Ponyboy.

11:44.354 --> 11:48.057
- And it was fine.
- Really?

11:48.091 --> 11:51.727
I mean, sure, I didn't get
to tag along with them

11:51.761 --> 11:53.329
to all the cool parties.

11:53.363 --> 11:56.532
And... sometimes I felt
like they were using me

11:56.566 --> 11:59.068
just because my sister
was so good-looking.

11:59.102 --> 12:01.804
Who am I kidding?
It was terrible!

12:03.273 --> 12:05.541
There's nothing worse
than being a third wheel!

12:05.575 --> 12:07.409
And the worst part is...

12:08.678 --> 12:10.613
...you never get over it!

12:12.349 --> 12:14.350
You're scarred for life!

12:16.620 --> 12:18.520
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:23.293 --> 12:26.295
Uh... Harper?

12:29.099 --> 12:30.933
Are you ready to help
with the float?

12:32.636 --> 12:35.304
Justin, I'm sorry,
I can't help you anymore.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.774
I'm too upset to do anything
creative or productive.

12:38.808 --> 12:42.311
Now you know pretty much
how I've felt my entire life.

12:46.116 --> 12:47.950
I know, it's gonna be okay.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.319
I wasn't even cool enough
to hang out

12:50.353 --> 12:52.655
with a guy named Ponyboy.

12:54.591 --> 12:56.358
Ponyboy?

13:00.263 --> 13:03.065
Okay. Think, Justin, think.

13:03.099 --> 13:06.402
Without Alex around, Harper won't
be able to help with the float.

13:06.436 --> 13:09.405
And without Harper,
the float won't get done.

13:09.439 --> 13:11.874
So, there's only
one thing left to do.

13:11.908 --> 13:13.342
I've gotta use magic.

13:19.282 --> 13:22.818
All right, I'll just pretend I'm
Alex and convince Harper to help me.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.388
No, I can't do it.
It's just not me.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.659
But I do need
to finish the float.

13:37.133 --> 13:40.135
But it's a selfish use of
magic, and that's wrong.

13:42.005 --> 13:45.808
But it would allow Harper to be
with her friend, which would be nice.

13:49.946 --> 13:51.413
No, I can't do it.

13:52.549 --> 13:54.016
But I have to.

13:55.352 --> 13:56.652
But I can't.

13:58.021 --> 13:59.021
Alex?

14:03.493 --> 14:06.161
Oh, my gosh, you came back
to be with me.

14:07.697 --> 14:10.499
Yes, I'm... Ahem!
Yes, I'm... I'm Alex.

14:12.902 --> 14:16.739
And I came back to...
work on the float with you,

14:16.773 --> 14:19.174
and also to tell you
how much you mean to me.

14:19.209 --> 14:23.312
You've never said that
to me before. Thanks.

14:23.346 --> 14:25.781
Well, you're welcome.

14:27.984 --> 14:30.386
You've never said that to me
or to anyone.

14:30.420 --> 14:33.288
You must be really
making an effort here.

14:35.024 --> 14:37.993
Wow. She sure has set
the bar low for herself.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.730
Why are you wearing
Justin's clothes?

14:43.533 --> 14:47.536
Because I stole them.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.806
From Justin.

14:50.840 --> 14:54.543
Because I'm a dirty,
lying thief.

14:54.577 --> 14:56.812
I know you are.

15:07.357 --> 15:09.691
We did it!
We finished the float.

15:09.726 --> 15:11.727
This is just so...

15:16.633 --> 15:18.066
Alex, I'm really
proud of you.

15:18.101 --> 15:21.637
I've never seen you work so hard
on anything in my entire life.

15:21.671 --> 15:25.374
Yeah, well, I probably
wouldn't get too used to it.

15:25.408 --> 15:28.444
I mean, it's not like
I'm Justin or anything.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.614
Yeah, lucky for you.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.484
I beg your pardon?

15:35.518 --> 15:37.886
That's just what
you always say.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.158
- Oh, no.
- What?

15:44.661 --> 15:48.397
Let's pretend that we didn't
work on a float together.

15:48.431 --> 15:52.367
I'll be right back, probably
wearing different clothes.

15:57.807 --> 16:02.077
Wow! The float
looks nice, Harper.

16:02.111 --> 16:04.613
I'd hope so.

16:04.647 --> 16:07.749
You and I worked hard enough
on it. Nice new outfit.

16:09.018 --> 16:10.452
What are you
talking about?

16:12.288 --> 16:14.723
Well, you changed. You were
wearing Justin's clothes.

16:14.757 --> 16:17.259
Justin's clothes?
Disgusting.

16:19.696 --> 16:21.563
Hey!

16:21.598 --> 16:24.166
Wow, look at
the two best friends

16:24.200 --> 16:26.668
standing in front
of a homecoming float.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.439
You know, I don't know
who built this thing,

16:30.473 --> 16:34.910
because really, I wasn't here,
but it sure does look great.

16:34.944 --> 16:36.545
Alex and I built it,

16:36.579 --> 16:39.314
and it's one of the more pleasant
afternoons we've ever spent together.

16:39.349 --> 16:41.783
Harper, that doesn't
make any sense.

16:41.818 --> 16:44.753
Hey, I got an idea.
Let's not talk about it.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.656
You know what
doesn't make sense

16:47.690 --> 16:50.959
is how you changed clothes
faster than humanly possible.

16:52.128 --> 16:53.529
All right!
You broke me down!

16:53.563 --> 16:55.631
All the constant stares.
It was me!

16:57.867 --> 17:01.236
I used magic for selfish
purposes to turn myself into Alex.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.672
And that means
you were out with Stevie.

17:03.706 --> 17:07.142
And I really am the third
wheel. Oh, I can't believe it.

17:07.977 --> 17:10.078
Third wheel?

17:10.113 --> 17:13.781
Wait, are you saying I can't
hang out with other friends?

17:13.816 --> 17:16.451
I guess you can do whatever you
want, Alex, just like you always do.

17:16.486 --> 17:20.021
And I'll keep on forgiving you,
just like I always do.

17:20.056 --> 17:23.090
Is that the way you think
our relationship works?

17:23.126 --> 17:25.027
Pretty much, yeah.

17:28.330 --> 17:31.166
Well, now I'm getting
upset with you.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.936
Oh, well, don't worry. I won't
hold it against you. I never do.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.804
Will you stop it?

17:35.838 --> 17:38.140
You're not acting like a
very good friend right now.

17:38.174 --> 17:40.709
Excuse me?

17:44.547 --> 17:47.049
Did you just say I'm not acting
like a very good friend?

17:47.083 --> 17:49.718
'Cause you can call me a lot
of things, Alex, and you have,

17:49.752 --> 17:51.587
but a bad friend is not okay.

17:51.621 --> 17:53.855
Would a bad friend be working
so hard on something she hates?

17:53.890 --> 17:55.691
That's right.
I hate this float idea.

17:55.725 --> 17:57.893
I think it's tacky
and cynical.

17:57.927 --> 18:00.195
But I'm working on it 'cause it's
the one my best friend wanted to do.

18:00.229 --> 18:01.830
That's the kind
of friend I am.

18:01.864 --> 18:03.899
Fine. If you hate
this float so much,

18:03.933 --> 18:05.334
then why don't I just
get rid of it for you?

18:05.368 --> 18:08.437
Because that's the kind
of friend I am.

18:08.471 --> 18:09.905
What are you doing?
Stop it!

18:09.939 --> 18:11.306
I'm not gonna let you
do it on your own

18:11.341 --> 18:13.575
'cause that's the kind
of friend I am!

18:15.044 --> 18:18.113
Well, I'm gonna tear faster
to save you the trouble.

18:18.147 --> 18:19.514
'cause that's
the kind of friend I am!

18:19.549 --> 18:22.618
Oh, not if I can
help it, friend!

18:22.652 --> 18:24.553
By the way,
I forgive you!

18:25.922 --> 18:27.789
For what?!

18:27.824 --> 18:30.692
I don't know!
I'm just being friendly!

18:33.029 --> 18:35.897
Harper, please! What are you
doing? What about all our hard work?

18:35.932 --> 18:38.500
Who says you can't
stop time?

18:41.471 --> 18:44.473
And it serves you right taking
advantage of me like that.

18:44.507 --> 18:47.476
Aaah!
I know. I'm ashamed.

18:56.753 --> 19:01.490
What in the name of Rancho
Cucamonga is going on here?

19:01.524 --> 19:03.325
Mr. Laritate,
I can explain.

19:03.359 --> 19:06.028
Spare me the tattletale
act, Mr. Russo.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.698
When I heard your sister was involved
in this, I knew it would end badly.

19:09.732 --> 19:13.568
You are like a dust devil in a
field of brittle brush, Missy.

19:16.873 --> 19:19.174
Come on. You're just
making stuff up

19:19.208 --> 19:21.109
that sounds Western now,
aren't you?

19:24.113 --> 19:26.648
You are destroying
school-funded property,

19:26.683 --> 19:29.051
which is grounds
for expulsion.

19:29.085 --> 19:32.354
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait! You can't expel Alex.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.389
Why not?

19:34.424 --> 19:37.192
'Cause it was me. Alex had
nothing to do with this.

19:37.226 --> 19:38.727
It was all my fault.

19:38.761 --> 19:42.397
Well, I'll admit I'm surprised
to hear you say that, Miss Finkle.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.801
Harper, what are you doing?
Just tell him the truth.

19:45.835 --> 19:48.937
I am. This was all me.

19:50.339 --> 19:53.275
No, no, it wasn't,
Mr. Laritate. It was me, too.

19:53.309 --> 19:56.378
In fact, it was mostly me. You
can't punish Harper for this.

19:56.412 --> 20:00.782
Well, let's see. Two people telling
me two completely different stories.

20:00.817 --> 20:04.186
How will I ever
solve is problem?

20:04.220 --> 20:07.889
- I believe Harper.
- What? Wait... Why?

20:07.924 --> 20:11.727
Because, frankly,
Miss Russo, you are a liar.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.997
And as for you, Miss Finkle,
there's a special place

20:16.032 --> 20:18.867
reserved in detention
for first offenders.

20:18.901 --> 20:20.869
Actually,
it's not that special.

20:20.903 --> 20:23.004
It's a bean bag chair
in my office.

20:23.039 --> 20:24.806
But good luck
getting out of it.

20:24.841 --> 20:26.808
The trail of tears
is that way.

20:37.683 --> 20:39.350
This isn't so bad.

20:39.385 --> 20:42.687
Yeah, well, wait until
you try and get up.

20:47.226 --> 20:48.559
Show-off.

20:49.762 --> 20:52.096
You just earned yourself
an extra hour detention.

20:59.171 --> 21:00.305
Alex?

21:02.841 --> 21:04.075
What are you doing here?

21:04.109 --> 21:05.510
I feel bad about
what happened

21:05.544 --> 21:07.245
and I'm worried that
you're still mad at me.

21:07.279 --> 21:08.980
If I was still
mad at you

21:09.014 --> 21:11.549
would I have taken the blame
for ruining the homecoming float?

21:11.583 --> 21:13.284
Why did you do that?

21:13.319 --> 21:16.387
'Cause I saw how much trouble
you were going to get into,

21:16.422 --> 21:18.389
and even though Stevie's
your new best friend

21:18.424 --> 21:20.491
I guess I wanted to keep
being your friend, too.

21:21.860 --> 21:23.895
Well, you're not
my friend, Harper.

21:23.929 --> 21:25.263
What?

21:26.465 --> 21:28.199
Stevie's my friend.

21:28.934 --> 21:30.535
You're my sister.

21:34.807 --> 21:36.808
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

21:37.810 --> 21:40.545
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

21:40.579 --> 21:42.714
Well, I'm not gonna
let you sit in here alone.

21:42.748 --> 21:45.550
But what if you
get in trouble?

21:45.584 --> 21:47.418
For what,
sneaking into detention?

21:47.453 --> 21:48.953
Yeah, I'd love to see
how that works.

21:50.956 --> 21:53.624
I guess if you get into trouble
you're already here, so...

21:53.659 --> 21:56.027
Hey, your boots match
the detention chair.

21:56.061 --> 21:58.896
Yeah, there used
to be two chairs.
