00:02.422 --> 00:04.731
Give me an explanation
why the pharmacist has to be...

00:07.342 --> 00:10.618
...two and a half feet up
above everybody else.

00:10.942 --> 00:14.571
What the hell is he doing he can't be
on the floor with you and me?

00:14.742 --> 00:18.451
Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear
physicists, we're on the same level.

00:18.782 --> 00:21.819
Oh, no, he's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

00:21.982 --> 00:25.338
"Look out, everybody,
I'm working with pills.

00:25.662 --> 00:27.573
Spread out, give me some room."

00:28.102 --> 00:30.741
The only hard part of his whole job
that I could see...

00:30.942 --> 00:33.661
...is typing everything
onto that little, tiny label.

00:34.142 --> 00:36.702
And has to try and get
all the words on there...

00:36.862 --> 00:40.298
...keep the little piece of paper
in the roller of the typewriter.

00:40.462 --> 00:43.420
Oh, no. He's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

00:43.582 --> 00:47.700
"Yeah, I'd like to get this
prescription filled."

00:47.862 --> 00:51.218
"All right. You wait down there.

00:51.502 --> 00:53.094
Only I'm allowed up here."

00:59.422 --> 01:01.617
- Where'd you meet her?
- I met her on an elevator.

01:01.782 --> 01:04.501
On an elevator?
You met a woman on an elevator?

01:04.662 --> 01:07.415
- Impossible, right?
- You got less than 60 seconds.

01:07.582 --> 01:09.937
That's like dismantling a time bomb.

01:10.302 --> 01:12.941
- What got into you?
- I don't know. She was so beautiful...

01:13.102 --> 01:14.820
...it was a pure reflex. The words...

01:14.982 --> 01:17.815
...just came out of my mouth.
- Wow. What did you say?

01:19.582 --> 01:23.097
You know, I'm the one responsible
for those crop circles in England.

01:25.462 --> 01:27.657
- Can you believe I did that?
- What did she say?

01:27.822 --> 01:29.813
What crop circles?

01:31.582 --> 01:33.857
- Not a good sign.
- Not everybody knows...

01:34.022 --> 01:37.014
...what the crop circles are.
You know what the crop circles are?

01:37.182 --> 01:39.252
Crop circles?
Why don't you buy something?

01:39.702 --> 01:41.181
You got something in your teeth.

01:41.622 --> 01:43.340
- What?
- It's green.

01:43.502 --> 01:47.495
Oh, man, spinach. I've been
walking around like this all afternoon.

01:47.662 --> 01:51.291
- You bump into anybody you knew?
- I had a job interview.

01:51.702 --> 01:53.977
- How did it go?
- Take a guess.

01:54.142 --> 01:57.179
Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing
available at the present time...

01:57.342 --> 01:59.537
...but should anything open up,
we'll be in touch.

01:59.942 --> 02:01.739
Okay, thanks.

02:02.862 --> 02:04.534
You don't need a job.
You got Audrey.

02:04.702 --> 02:06.454
Yeah. Right.

02:07.182 --> 02:09.092
- What's the matter?
- No. Nothing.

02:09.782 --> 02:11.852
- What?
- You won't think I'm a bad person?

02:12.182 --> 02:13.661
Too late for that.

02:13.822 --> 02:17.576
Because, believe me, I would only say
this to you and maybe a psychiatrist.

02:17.942 --> 02:19.455
What is it?

02:19.622 --> 02:21.055
Well...

02:22.662 --> 02:24.459
Her nose is a little big.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.421
Yeah, she's got a big nose.

02:28.542 --> 02:30.897
I mean, big would even be okay.

02:31.422 --> 02:32.650
It's beyond big.

02:34.102 --> 02:35.899
It's a schnoz.

02:36.702 --> 02:38.613
I'm aware that my own
physical dimensions...

02:38.782 --> 02:41.421
...are a little short of perfection.
- A little.

02:41.622 --> 02:43.817
Who am I to be thinking
about someone's nose?

02:43.982 --> 02:48.055
I should be grateful someone like her
looks at me. I have no job, nothing.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.499
But I have to say,
I think about the nose.

02:51.022 --> 02:54.617
I don't wanna think about it, I don't ask
to think about it, but I think about it.

02:54.782 --> 02:58.741
I go to bed, I tell myself, " Don't
think about the nose." I think about it.

02:58.942 --> 03:01.820
I look at her, I see the nose.

03:02.742 --> 03:05.097
Stop being so concerned with looks.

03:12.662 --> 03:16.211
- Have you said anything to her?
- No. Could never do that.

03:16.382 --> 03:18.418
The ironic thing is,
if she had a smaller nose...

03:18.582 --> 03:22.655
...I never could've dated her. She'd be
out of my league with a smaller nose.

03:23.222 --> 03:26.214
And I really like her. I know that.

03:26.382 --> 03:28.338
And I know one other thing:

03:28.822 --> 03:30.858
I'm not getting past that nose.

03:32.382 --> 03:34.054
All right, shut up. Here they come.

03:34.662 --> 03:37.256
How can I not think about it?
Look at the size of this thing.

03:39.102 --> 03:43.175
My mother's going out with this guy
who leaves a jacket in her house.

03:43.342 --> 03:47.460
She gives to me. Well, two years later,
he shows up and takes it back.

03:47.822 --> 03:51.337
Now he's in prison.
Got arrested for mail fraud.

03:51.782 --> 03:56.298
So, Elaine, go over to the apartment,
tell the landlord you're his daughter...

03:56.462 --> 03:58.214
...and you wanna bring him
the jacket.

03:58.382 --> 04:00.850
Won't the landlord know
I'm not the daughter?

04:01.022 --> 04:03.411
No, he's never met her.
She's in California.

04:04.542 --> 04:07.898
- Are you coming with me?
- Yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancÃ©.

04:10.302 --> 04:11.860
Peter Von Nostrand.

04:12.022 --> 04:14.058
Why don't you just
commit yourself already?

04:15.302 --> 04:16.940
What is so special
about this jacket?

04:17.101 --> 04:19.297
- No, you don't wanna know.
- God...

04:19.462 --> 04:23.421
He believes it possesses some
extraordinary power over women.

04:23.582 --> 04:25.334
What's that splotch on your hand?

04:25.502 --> 04:28.335
I got stamped at the
reggae lounge last night.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.812
I'm going back there tonight. I'm not
gonna pay another cover charge.

04:33.222 --> 04:34.541
You didn't wash all day?

04:34.862 --> 04:37.899
Yeah, I washed. Just not the hand.

04:39.662 --> 04:42.495
You wouldn't believe the women
at this club. Man.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.501
It's amazing how many
beautiful women live in New York.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.579
I actually find it kind of intimidating.

04:47.742 --> 04:50.461
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.

04:56.822 --> 04:59.416
- Kramer!
- What? What?

04:59.582 --> 05:01.652
How could you say
something like that?

05:01.822 --> 05:04.052
What do you mean?
I just said she needs a nose job.

05:04.222 --> 05:07.020
No, no. There's nothing wrong
with her nose.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.901
- God, I'm so sorry, Audrey.
- Oh, it's okay.

05:10.062 --> 05:13.338
- What did you have to say that for?
- I was just trying to help out.

05:14.142 --> 05:18.294
Yeah, well, you can kiss that jacket
goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.

05:20.182 --> 05:22.218
You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

05:23.742 --> 05:25.778
But what would the world be like...

05:25.982 --> 05:28.098
...if people said whatever
they were thinking...

05:28.742 --> 05:30.937
...all the time,
whenever it came to them?

05:31.262 --> 05:34.299
How long would a blind date last?

05:34.462 --> 05:36.373
About 13 seconds, I think.

05:36.782 --> 05:39.535
"Sorry, your rear end is too big."
"Okay, your breath stinks."

05:39.702 --> 05:42.660
"See you later. No problem. Goodbye."
"Okay, thank you very much."

05:43.262 --> 05:46.140
Elaine said I can stay with her
another month till Tina gets back.

05:47.102 --> 05:48.535
What are you thinking about?

05:49.422 --> 05:51.140
Thinking? Nothing.

05:51.302 --> 05:53.497
What could I possibly be thinking?

05:53.862 --> 05:56.330
You look like you've got something
on your mind.

05:56.502 --> 06:00.381
Yeah, right. I wish I had
something on my mind.

06:05.262 --> 06:06.615
So how about that Kramer?

06:07.182 --> 06:09.173
Yeah, how about him?

06:09.342 --> 06:12.971
- The way he just says stuff.
- He sure does.

06:13.142 --> 06:14.939
Yeah, yeah.

06:15.782 --> 06:17.773
Yeah, he's quite a character.

06:18.742 --> 06:20.858
So, what did you think?

06:21.222 --> 06:22.575
About the pizza?

06:23.222 --> 06:25.452
No. About the nose job.

06:26.102 --> 06:29.219
Oh, the nose job. Yeah...

06:29.502 --> 06:30.935
I don't know. l...

06:31.542 --> 06:35.251
- Well, what did you think?
- Well, I've thought about it...

06:35.502 --> 06:38.141
...but I don't know.
- Yeah.

06:40.142 --> 06:43.259
You know, not that I care
one way or the other...

06:43.422 --> 06:47.097
...but these doctors today do amazing
things. If you were so inclined.

06:47.302 --> 06:51.739
- And again, I'm not suggesting.
- I know. They're good.

06:51.902 --> 06:53.494
Peter Jennings had one.

06:53.662 --> 06:55.732
- Really?
- Probably. They all do.

06:55.902 --> 06:58.814
In my high school,
half my graduating class had them.

06:58.982 --> 07:01.257
Of course,
I'm from Long Island, so...

07:05.182 --> 07:07.412
It's really nothing.
It's like going to the dentist.

07:08.142 --> 07:11.339
- I hate the dentist.
- It's a cleaning.

07:13.102 --> 07:14.774
So you really think I should do this.

07:15.462 --> 07:19.421
If it makes you happy.
I don't focus on these things.

07:21.182 --> 07:22.900
I will tell you this, though.

07:24.022 --> 07:26.013
Unfortunately...

07:26.182 --> 07:28.776
...we live in a very
superficial society.

07:30.022 --> 07:31.660
I don't condone it...

07:32.742 --> 07:33.970
...but it's a fact of life.

07:35.302 --> 07:37.133
Well, maybe I should.

07:37.662 --> 07:40.699
- What the hell?
- Now you talked her into a nose job?

07:40.862 --> 07:43.899
- Me? I didn't say anything.
- You encouraged her to get one.

07:44.062 --> 07:46.781
- I didn't encourage. No encourage.
- "Peter Jennings had one"?

07:47.462 --> 07:48.690
It's possible.

07:48.982 --> 07:52.338
- You should accept her for who she is.
- No, George is right.

07:52.502 --> 07:54.777
- I wanna get one.
- I think it's a mistake.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.534
Me too. Really.

07:58.022 --> 07:59.899
Unless you'd really like one, then...

08:03.102 --> 08:04.899
I'm going straight to hell.

08:06.062 --> 08:07.256
No two ways about it.

08:07.422 --> 08:10.095
It might not be hell,
but you're gonna run into bad dudes.

08:12.262 --> 08:14.617
Get the check.
She takes the bandages off at 4:00.

08:14.782 --> 08:16.374
We have time.

08:17.342 --> 08:19.378
It's exciting.
She's gonna have a new face.

08:19.902 --> 08:23.417
- It is exciting.
- Not as exciting as Miss Crop Circles.

08:24.142 --> 08:26.940
Please, please. Isabel?

08:27.102 --> 08:30.299
She is the most despicable woman
I have ever met in my life.

08:30.462 --> 08:34.136
I have never been so repulsed
by someone mentally...

08:34.302 --> 08:37.817
...and so attracted to them physically
at the same time.

08:37.982 --> 08:41.496
It's like my brain is facing my penis
in a chess game.

08:46.142 --> 08:47.734
And I'm letting him win.

08:48.182 --> 08:50.776
You're not letting him win.
He wins till you're 40.

08:50.942 --> 08:54.378
- Then what?
- He still wins, but it's not a blowout.

08:56.542 --> 08:57.975
She wants to be an actress.

08:58.142 --> 09:01.896
She makes me read these moronic
acting scenes with her, and I do it.

09:02.262 --> 09:06.778
Because I'm so addicted to the sex,
I'm helpless. I'll do anything.

09:07.022 --> 09:09.172
So, finally, Kramer comes in
the other day.

09:09.622 --> 09:11.658
I don't want to see this woman
anymore...

09:11.822 --> 09:14.290
...but I haven't got the willpower
to throw out her number.

09:14.462 --> 09:16.100
Please help me.

09:16.942 --> 09:18.295
Help me.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.216
I'm proud of you.

09:26.782 --> 09:29.501
So I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm going cold turkey.

09:29.662 --> 09:30.981
Good for you.

09:32.382 --> 09:34.942
I'll tell you, the sex...

09:36.342 --> 09:38.776
I was like an animal.

09:38.942 --> 09:41.012
I mean, it was just
completely uninhibited.

09:41.942 --> 09:46.299
It's like going to the bathroom in front
of a lot of people, and not caring.

09:50.782 --> 09:52.693
It's not like that at all.

09:57.062 --> 09:59.053
How do you even know
the jacket is there?

09:59.902 --> 10:01.176
Well, I don't. I'm guessing.

10:01.822 --> 10:04.700
Okay, look, Audrey,
before you take the bandage off...

10:05.102 --> 10:07.935
...just remember, I was the one
that encouraged you to do this.

10:08.142 --> 10:11.817
Now that you're gonna be a great
beauty, let's not forget how this began.

10:11.982 --> 10:14.257
- lf you listened to your friend Elaine...
- George.

10:14.582 --> 10:15.935
- Yeah?
- Enough.

10:16.102 --> 10:17.501
- Right, enough.
- Are we ready?

10:17.662 --> 10:19.459
Come on,
let's get this show on the road.

10:19.662 --> 10:22.051
- You sure you want us here for this?
- Yes.

10:22.382 --> 10:25.658
- Shouldn't a doctor do it?
- No, he said I could do it.

10:25.822 --> 10:27.574
Okay, here goes.

10:27.742 --> 10:31.257
This is very exciting. Very exciting.
It's like watching a birth.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.654
It looks good.

10:38.622 --> 10:41.090
- Great job.
- You got butchered.

10:48.142 --> 10:50.133
Head hurt.
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

10:50.382 --> 10:52.259
Let's put him over here.

10:53.342 --> 10:55.412
- Where are you going?
- To that doctor.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.453
Wait, wait, wait! I'll go with you.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.074

11:06.942 --> 11:08.694
How you feeling?

11:09.662 --> 11:12.256
Too much salt in my diet.

11:13.062 --> 11:15.417
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm good.

11:15.902 --> 11:18.132
You sure? Anything.

11:20.182 --> 11:21.615
No.

11:25.022 --> 11:27.456
Boy, it really didn't come out
too well, did it?

11:27.742 --> 11:31.052
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

11:32.142 --> 11:33.541
It's, like, all dented.

11:35.102 --> 11:36.820
Seems to be.

11:39.382 --> 11:41.373
Well, I'm sure
they'll be able to fix it.

11:41.622 --> 11:46.298
You can't stop modern science.
Can't stop it. Can't stop science.

11:46.462 --> 11:49.340
Can't be stopped. No way, no how.
Science just marches...

11:49.502 --> 11:51.458
Shut up, George.

11:53.502 --> 11:55.697
- Shut up?
- Yeah.

11:57.782 --> 11:59.340
Interesting.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.213
Come on, Kramer.
Seriously, give me her number!

12:04.382 --> 12:05.895
- I threw it out.
- You're lying.

12:06.062 --> 12:08.212
- You've got it. I want the number.
- I threw it out.

12:08.422 --> 12:10.413
- Give it to me.
- You said not to.

12:10.582 --> 12:13.176
- You made me promise.
- I changed my mind. I want it.

12:13.342 --> 12:15.219
You said no matter what,
I'm not to give it to you.

12:15.382 --> 12:17.452
- I was lying. Give it to me.
- You told me not to.

12:17.622 --> 12:20.420
- I want the number!
- All right! You want it? Yeah!

12:20.822 --> 12:23.894
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah, look at you.

12:24.182 --> 12:26.093
Look at what you've sunk to.

12:26.262 --> 12:27.581
Look at what you've become.

12:27.862 --> 12:30.774
Look in the mirror, because you
need help, Jerry. You need help.

12:31.262 --> 12:34.937
Because I can't stand by and do it
anymore. It's turning my stomach.

12:35.102 --> 12:38.412
I can't stand around here
watching you destroy yourself!

12:38.582 --> 12:40.857
It's eating me up inside!

12:51.902 --> 12:56.851
The doctor said they need to build the
lateral wall of the septum. Over here.

12:57.062 --> 12:58.290
Yeah.

12:58.462 --> 13:01.135
- You see this paranasal sinus cavity?
- Oh, I got it.

13:01.302 --> 13:05.659
See how it's collapsed?
That's what's causing this huge dent.

13:05.822 --> 13:08.097
Yeah. Rough, rough.

13:09.342 --> 13:11.378
So anyway, you know what
I was thinking about?

13:11.902 --> 13:13.130
What?

13:13.302 --> 13:16.055
Remember we talked
about taking a trip together?

13:16.262 --> 13:20.335
- We did?
- We talked about going to Hawaii.

13:20.862 --> 13:22.898
- Hawaii?
- Anyway, I think it would be great...

13:23.062 --> 13:25.530
...to get away after all this.

13:26.142 --> 13:27.575
Well, you...

13:29.702 --> 13:32.057
You know, Hawaii could be
a little tricky now.

13:32.222 --> 13:34.941
There's high-pressure winds
down there this time of year.

13:35.102 --> 13:38.094
There's a lot of debris
constantly flying around, a lot of...

13:38.262 --> 13:40.298
...wood and lava.

13:40.662 --> 13:42.141
It could be dangerous.

13:42.342 --> 13:45.778
- I never heard that.
- Oh, yeah. My friend lived there, so...

13:46.102 --> 13:48.536
We could go to the Caribbean.

13:49.582 --> 13:52.460
I have to tell you something.
You couldn't get me on a plane now.

13:52.742 --> 13:54.619
I get those FAA reports directly.

13:54.822 --> 13:57.655
My uncle sends them to me.
He used to be a pilot, so...

13:58.182 --> 13:59.900
Big investigation in the...

14:00.542 --> 14:04.933
What's the word there?
Offing. It's in the offing.

14:05.262 --> 14:10.620
But you shouldn't let that stop you
from going. You could go. I don't mind.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.379
- George?
- Yeah.

14:13.702 --> 14:15.772
I don't think this is working.

14:16.862 --> 14:21.777
Ever since you came back from
the Army, you've changed.

14:22.542 --> 14:27.093
I swear, Nelson, I don't even know
who you are anymore.

14:27.342 --> 14:29.333
I'm Nelson.

14:30.622 --> 14:34.137
- That's not the line, Jerry.
- All right, all right, I'm sorry.

14:35.422 --> 14:39.415
Nothing's changed, Elma.
I just need more time.

14:40.982 --> 14:45.134
I swear, Nelson, sometimes at
night when you're not around...

14:45.902 --> 14:49.338
...I just go crazy thinking
about you.

14:49.742 --> 14:51.221
Well, you just need to relax.

14:52.982 --> 14:54.620
Maybe a hobby. Bowling is fun.

14:55.702 --> 14:59.251
Yeah, bowling's good,
if you're really gross and ugly.

14:59.902 --> 15:02.291
Uh-oh. My organs
are playing chess again.

15:02.462 --> 15:06.296
I'm getting tired of this. What do you
say we play one for all the marbles?

15:06.462 --> 15:09.818
Oh, brain, what are you doing?
You cannot beat me.

15:09.982 --> 15:13.338
Do you have any idea who you're
dealing with? Forget about it.

15:13.502 --> 15:14.935
I can't take her anymore.

15:15.102 --> 15:18.617
- I hate reading her little acting scenes.
- Oh, so what?

15:18.782 --> 15:20.500
So you read from a little play.

15:20.662 --> 15:24.018
You can't put up with that for an hour
to make me happy? You're so selfish.

15:24.182 --> 15:25.774
Give me one hour.

15:26.222 --> 15:29.020
Then I will take over. You won't
have to think for the rest of the night.

15:29.182 --> 15:30.535
What about tomorrow morning?

15:30.702 --> 15:34.138
Do you have any idea what
that's like for me? Do you care?

15:34.302 --> 15:35.735
No, you don't care.

15:35.902 --> 15:39.338
So long as you get to do
whatever it is you do.

15:39.502 --> 15:41.936
- You disgust me.
- Oh, go read a book.

15:42.102 --> 15:44.980
Enough chatter. Let's play.

15:45.822 --> 15:48.655
I'm only doing this because
you took Audrey to the hospital.

15:48.862 --> 15:52.059
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, now, you're clear?
You got everything?

15:52.222 --> 15:53.735
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.530
Here.

15:56.982 --> 16:00.213
- What do I need this for?
- Because we're engaged.

16:00.862 --> 16:02.932
We're engaged?

16:03.302 --> 16:04.974
Kramer, this is too big.

16:05.462 --> 16:08.659
- It's my mom's.
- Hello!

16:08.822 --> 16:13.100
Oh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper.
I'm Albert Pepper's daughter.

16:13.262 --> 16:15.730
My father asked me to pick up
his jacket for him.

16:15.902 --> 16:18.132
Hello, Miss Pepper.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

16:18.382 --> 16:20.612
And you must be
Professor Von Nostrand.

16:20.782 --> 16:21.976
Yes. Yes, I am.

16:22.742 --> 16:26.257
I've read your book, professor,
and I was quite intrigued by it.

16:26.742 --> 16:29.575
- Yes, well, it's very intriguing.
- Tell me...

16:29.742 --> 16:32.859
...is it your contention that
Shakespeare was an impostor?

16:33.022 --> 16:34.455
- My contention?
- Your contention.

16:34.622 --> 16:37.614
- Well, yes, that's my contention.
- I heard him contend that.

16:37.942 --> 16:39.773
It's too bad about your father.

16:39.942 --> 16:43.537
- It was a frame-up.
- A fine man. He spoke often of you.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.932
He's very proud of the work
you're doing.

16:46.302 --> 16:49.931
- We're all proud of the work I'm doing.
- Yes, she does fine work.

16:50.142 --> 16:54.454
Your father gave me strict orders
not to turn the jacket over to anyone...

16:54.622 --> 16:57.182
...but I suppose I can make
an exception in your case.

16:57.342 --> 16:59.412
- The closet's this way.
- How kind of you.

16:59.622 --> 17:02.614
You know, your father has a very
extensive wardrobe.

17:02.782 --> 17:04.374
Yes.

17:08.541 --> 17:10.931
What's the matter, fella?
You look a little tired.

17:11.902 --> 17:13.813
Nelson, don't you see?

17:15.262 --> 17:17.412
You are a part of me.

17:18.142 --> 17:19.814
And I...

17:20.422 --> 17:22.935
I am a part of you.

17:23.662 --> 17:25.015
She's killing me.

17:31.302 --> 17:32.701
That's your move?

17:32.862 --> 17:35.501
- Yeah.
- Well, that's trouble, my friend.

17:35.662 --> 17:37.414
That's big trouble.

17:37.702 --> 17:39.055
Checkmate.

17:41.662 --> 17:44.222
Getting weak. Losing power.

17:44.902 --> 17:48.053
You haven't seen the last of me.
I'll be back.

17:48.542 --> 17:52.171
You're nothing without me.
Nothing.

17:54.182 --> 17:55.900
Little punk.

17:58.422 --> 18:01.573
Isabel, I don't think this is working.

18:05.462 --> 18:08.135
Daddy certainly does have
an extensive wardrobe.

18:08.302 --> 18:13.012
He is a fine dresser. I don't have to tell
you he's quite popular with the ladies.

18:13.262 --> 18:16.572
My father? Really? I had no idea.

18:16.742 --> 18:17.970
They're crazy about him.

18:18.142 --> 18:21.498
One in particular came around
about two years ago.

18:22.062 --> 18:24.781
Looked a lot like you, professor.
Could have been your mother.

18:25.182 --> 18:27.332
What was her name again?

18:27.822 --> 18:29.972
Carter? Kramer. That's it.

18:30.262 --> 18:33.334
Babs Kramer. Nasty woman.

18:33.502 --> 18:35.652
Many a night I had to
throw her on the street...

18:35.822 --> 18:38.211
...drunken stumblebum.
- You don't say.

18:38.382 --> 18:41.613
- I found it!
- She walked around here half-naked...

18:41.782 --> 18:44.933
...sucking Colt 45 from a can.

18:45.102 --> 18:49.015
Her big, fat stomach hanging out,
orthopaedic hose up to her knees...

18:49.182 --> 18:50.900
...screaming down the hall:

18:51.062 --> 18:53.815
"Come back to bed, Albert,
you big hairy ape!

18:53.982 --> 18:57.577
And bring back that box of Danish!"

18:59.062 --> 19:01.656
- So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
- Yeah, and I yelled out:

19:01.822 --> 19:04.177
"Kramer, Kramer, you're killing him."

19:04.742 --> 19:07.256
- So I assume the jig was up.
- Yeah, pretty much.

19:07.422 --> 19:09.094
But look.

19:09.422 --> 19:10.855
Yes.

19:12.062 --> 19:14.860
- Hi. Here are your keys.
- Hi. Thank you.

19:15.022 --> 19:16.933
- Hello.
- Audrey.

19:18.102 --> 19:21.094
My God, you look incredible.
I can't believe it.

19:21.822 --> 19:24.814
Well, it was his doctor.
He was wonderful.

19:25.102 --> 19:26.854
So will I see you later tonight?

19:27.382 --> 19:29.338
Not sure.

19:31.222 --> 19:33.736
Well, I'll check you guys out later.

19:34.462 --> 19:36.293
- Ready?
- I didn't wash.

19:36.462 --> 19:38.293
Neither did I.

19:38.822 --> 19:41.177
We're off to the reggae lounge.

19:48.182 --> 19:51.811
My nose, my nose.
My kingdom for a nose.

19:52.422 --> 19:56.734
Isn't she beautiful? Her nose
is in such perfect proportions...

19:56.902 --> 19:59.416
...to the rest of her face.
She's breathtaking.

19:59.582 --> 20:01.971
- Who would have thought, she's...?
- Elaine...

20:02.502 --> 20:04.060
...shut up.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.415
The technical term
for a nose job is...?

20:08.622 --> 20:11.534
- Rhinoplasty.
- Rhinoplasty.

20:12.222 --> 20:15.339
Rhino. Okay?

20:16.382 --> 20:21.172
Do we really need to insult the person
at this moment of their lives?

20:21.342 --> 20:24.254
They know they have a big nose.
That's why they're coming in.

20:24.422 --> 20:27.778
Do they really need the abuse
of being compared to a rhinoceros...

20:27.982 --> 20:30.052
...on top of everything else?

20:30.422 --> 20:32.652
When someone has a
hair transplant, they don't go:

20:32.822 --> 20:36.053
"We're going to perform a
cue ball-ectomy on you, Mr. Johnson.

20:36.782 --> 20:40.331
We're going to attempt to remove
the skinheadia...

20:40.502 --> 20:43.733
...of your chromedomus,
which is what we...

20:43.902 --> 20:46.336
The technical term..."
