00:03.837 --> 00:06.274
<i>Previously on</i> CSI: Vegas...

00:07.875 --> 00:10.978
All of these cases,
all of these people are related.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.646
Whoa, whoa.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.082
That file didn't close
by itself.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.217
<i>Someone's accessing the computer
and watching us.</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:19.320
<i>Molly, the person
who sent you that dossier</i>

00:19.420 --> 00:21.055
<i>and that card
with the silver ink,</i>

00:21.155 --> 00:22.256
<i>they left something on it.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:23.257
Find him, please.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.692
A few years ago,

00:24.792 --> 00:26.327
Molly confessed
to a few nonviolent crimes

00:26.427 --> 00:27.928
<i>to her therapist.</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:29.463
<i>Dr. Auerbach's notes
were printed</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:31.932
on the same printer
that produced these cards.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.467
The sick mind behind

00:33.567 --> 00:36.070
all of these murders
is Dr. Diane Auerbach.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.607
Go, go, go!

00:40.341 --> 00:42.676
That's no suicide.

00:45.413 --> 00:49.483
What does your grandma do
that makes you so mad?

00:50.784 --> 00:54.322
It can be hard to talk about
things that make you angry.

00:54.422 --> 00:57.425
That's okay.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.327
Sometimes,

00:59.427 --> 01:02.430
it's easier to draw
what's on your mind.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.832
Things that
make you happy,

01:04.932 --> 01:07.501
things that
bother you.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.937
Dreams, maybe.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.343
May I see your drawing?

01:36.330 --> 01:38.232
I was so sure.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.368
I was so certain
that she was responsible

01:40.468 --> 01:41.969
for all
of these murders.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.171
Some twisted soul

01:43.271 --> 01:44.638
was holding
Dr. Auerbach

01:44.738 --> 01:46.874
responsible for something, huh?

01:46.974 --> 01:48.642
Not much of
anything inside.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.245
Place has been empty for
a while, so whoever abducted her

01:51.345 --> 01:52.713
and brought her
out here,

01:52.813 --> 01:54.215
they didn't set up shop
in there.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.916
Nope. They were busy
back here.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.385
Honestly, I'm just wondering

01:57.485 --> 01:58.886
how they even got her
up there at all.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.222
<i>Dead weight's a bear
to carry on flat ground,</i>

02:01.322 --> 02:03.291
<i>let alone that far up.</i>

02:03.391 --> 02:04.825
I don't know
if he used a pulley,

02:04.925 --> 02:06.760
or what, but the killer
had to be strong

02:06.860 --> 02:09.630
and determined.
Must've taken a while.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.065
Jack says liver temp
puts time of death at about

02:12.166 --> 02:13.967
30 hours ago.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.103
I thought you and Serena
almost just ran into her

02:16.204 --> 02:18.038
at the house yesterday.
Yeah, we thought we did.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.242
Stop!
<i>But neither of us
actually saw her.</i>

02:22.042 --> 02:24.178
If it was the killer,
then they were here first,

02:24.278 --> 02:25.446
and they went back
to Diane's.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.748
Wonder what they
were looking for, huh?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.883
I wonder why they killed
our prime suspect.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.254
Seems a bit self-defeating,
redirects our attention.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.122
Canvass was a bust.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.557
Most of the cabins
out here

02:36.657 --> 02:37.925
are vacant
during the week,

02:38.025 --> 02:39.393
so we're hard up
for witnesses.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.628
So whoever did this,

02:40.728 --> 02:42.330
they would have plenty
of privacy for...

02:42.430 --> 02:44.365
whatever this is.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.567
"The Hanged Man."

02:46.667 --> 02:48.068
The tarot card.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.006
Me and my friends were really
into tarot in middle school.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.609
The Hanged Man
is upside down,

02:55.709 --> 02:58.612
hanging by one ankle
from a tree,

02:58.712 --> 03:00.614
hands behind
his back.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.417
Hope it's not
a bad omen.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.719
Last thing we need
is a cursed crime scene.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.722
This guy went to a lot
of trouble to stage this.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.525
If there's something it can
tell us, we need to know soon,

03:11.625 --> 03:13.261
Joshua.
On it.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.195
Thank you.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.933
You should check this out
over here, too.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.605
What do we have here?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.640
The greatest hits
of our connected cases.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.008
A mirror shard.

03:28.108 --> 03:31.211
<i>He used to kill Lynn Zobrist.</i>

03:31.312 --> 03:33.481
Chef's knife
and what I think is

03:33.581 --> 03:35.082
potassium cyanide solution.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.517
<i>Like the one
that took out our chef,</i>

03:36.617 --> 03:38.386
<i>Dario Donnelly.</i>

03:38.486 --> 03:41.121
And our captive
bolt pistol.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.724
<i>Like the one used to kill
Lamont Moore</i>

03:43.824 --> 03:45.926
<i>and those innocent bystanders.</i>

03:46.026 --> 03:48.095
Blood on the business end.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.129
No prints, though.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.998
But there are
some here.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.266
What have you got?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.067
See this vertical defect?

03:54.167 --> 03:57.538
It matches a healing cut
on Diane's right index finger.

03:57.638 --> 03:58.939
The killer had her sitting here?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.708
The way these weapons
are laid out,

04:00.808 --> 04:04.578
I think they made Diane choose
how she wanted to die.

04:07.715 --> 04:11.051
<i>Out of all the weapons
in our silver ink cases...</i>

04:12.720 --> 04:14.822
...she chose the quickest death.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.658
Half expected to find
another card.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.861
"Keep your secrets,
cull the rotten fruit."

04:20.961 --> 04:22.330
Whoever's behind all of this,

04:22.430 --> 04:23.931
they had to know how
all these cases connected.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.233
They were connected
because they were ordered

04:26.334 --> 04:29.169
by the same psychopath.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.438
Let's get him.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.572

Thank you.
Okay, fellas.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.498
She's in full rigor.
So let's take it nice and slow.

05:30.598 --> 05:31.932
Ladies.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.401
I thought you were in Hawaii
with your daughter.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.435
I came back
a day early.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.371
Lindsey...
was annoyed.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.173
You got it?
Yeah.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.409
Hard to
stay on vacation

05:41.509 --> 05:43.377
when a serial killer
is on the loose.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.713
Wish this killer
would take a vacation.

05:45.813 --> 05:46.880
So, Max said

05:46.980 --> 05:48.549
that the guy
gave her

05:48.649 --> 05:50.818
a choice of weapons
from the Silver Ink case.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.119
Catch me up.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.087
Leucocrystal violet
tests confirmed

05:54.187 --> 05:55.355
that the bolt gun was

05:55.456 --> 05:56.924
actually the only weapon
used on Diane.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.225
You didn't get anything else
from the other weapons?

05:58.325 --> 05:59.893
Prints?
No.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.662
Uh, the shard is from
a broken bathroom mirror

06:01.762 --> 06:03.431
in the cabin, the knife is from

06:03.531 --> 06:05.198
a block in the kitchen,

06:05.298 --> 06:06.667
and the serial on the bolt gun

06:06.767 --> 06:08.168
can only tell us
it was part of a batch

06:08.268 --> 06:09.803
sold through an online retailer.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.672
Trail goes cold there.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.441
And, obviously,
the cyanide solution

06:13.541 --> 06:15.075
is in an unmarked bottle.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.211
Maybe the victim
can tell us something.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.580
So far,

06:19.680 --> 06:20.881
Diane's not spilling
any secrets, just blood,

06:20.981 --> 06:22.650
and lots of it.
We only just figured out

06:22.750 --> 06:24.585
how to get her down without
dropping her on her head.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.820
You didn't see
anything up there?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.490
All I got was a workout
and more questions.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.758
I had Serena
look at the cuffs.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.460
They're not law-enforcement
issue.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.694
Could've come from
a sex shop, maybe.

06:33.794 --> 06:37.598
Or online. Or anywhere, really.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.567
Another question: Uh, you see

06:39.667 --> 06:42.736
all that old flaky paint
on the crossbar there?

06:42.836 --> 06:43.971
Well,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.273
there's a void
here I can't explain.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.875
If you threw a rope up over
that bar and hauled a body up,

06:47.975 --> 06:50.478
<i>you would strip paint
on three sides.</i>

06:51.344 --> 06:53.380
Anywhere you pull
a rope around that bar,

06:53.481 --> 06:55.683
there would be way
more disturbed paint.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.017
How the hell
did he get her up there?

06:57.117 --> 06:58.586
He didn't use a pulley?

06:58.686 --> 06:59.720
No clue.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.121
It was hard enough
to get her down,

07:01.221 --> 07:02.355
and she's in
rigor now.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.457
Well, if the killer
put her up there

07:03.557 --> 07:04.858
before she was stiff...

07:04.958 --> 07:06.326
Yeah, he would have
had a hell of a time.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.695
Be easier if he had help.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.396
You think we've got
more than one doer?

07:09.497 --> 07:11.231
All of the other
Silver Ink murders

07:11.331 --> 07:12.299
have been committed by
lone wolves.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.234
Lone wolves who were coerced.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.435
Maybe our man

07:15.536 --> 07:16.937
behind the curtain

07:17.037 --> 07:18.506
blackmailed
an accomplice.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.574
Something here
is gonna tell us.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.613
Oh, hey.
Any winners?

07:25.713 --> 07:28.148
Epithelial DNA from
the ropes and cuff

07:28.248 --> 07:30.083
come from
a single donor.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.885
Diane Auerbach.

07:31.985 --> 07:32.953
You?
Uh, just some soil.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.555
Matched a sample from the scene.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.989
Looks like the guy used
a rope that was laying around.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.491
There's nothing but
paint from the flagpole

07:37.591 --> 07:39.192
on this side of the cuffs.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.494
So, to recap,

07:40.594 --> 07:43.230
we have four weapons
that lead nowhere,

07:43.330 --> 07:45.465
no witnesses,
and no DNA

07:45.566 --> 07:47.601
or trace that point
toward any killer. Hmm.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.402
I don't want to use
the word "cursed."

07:49.503 --> 07:51.071
I don't think the guy
was casting a spell

07:51.171 --> 07:52.072
with his silver squiggles.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.240
We'll find something.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.307
You guys
collected everything

07:54.407 --> 07:55.576
you could fit
into that trunk.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.678
Plenty more bites
off that apple.

07:57.778 --> 07:58.812
When in doubt...

08:01.414 --> 08:03.817
...dust.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.369
It's just partials.
There's not one print

08:22.469 --> 08:23.637
with enough characteristics
to run through AFIS.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.573
That is some tough
taffy to chew.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.711
I have a
semi-crazy idea.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.079
What if we try
to piece together

08:32.179 --> 08:33.346
all of the partials,

08:33.446 --> 08:35.048
build a usable print
from what we have.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.917
Like a Franken-print?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.819
Look, I know it's not gonna
hold up in court,

08:38.919 --> 08:41.221
but it could lead to
a person of interest, right?

08:41.321 --> 08:42.289
These aren't even partials,

08:42.389 --> 08:43.557
these are partials
of partials.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.925
You think we can
cobble together

08:45.025 --> 08:47.027
something substantial
from such tiny bits?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.461
I once built

08:48.562 --> 08:50.063
the Taj Mahal
out of Legos.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.566
We got this.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.604
Ah, come on.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.809
Do you need a hand?

09:01.909 --> 09:04.778
I think
I need all of you.

09:08.515 --> 09:11.084
This guy is...

09:11.184 --> 09:12.720
not a great stand-in for

09:12.820 --> 09:14.321
Diane Auerbach.
He's a little too tall,

09:14.421 --> 09:16.624
too heavy.
Same goes for everybody else

09:16.724 --> 09:19.593
in my dummy closet.
Your dummy closet? Wow.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.565
All right.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.705
I got to figure out
if the killer

09:31.805 --> 09:33.607
had an accomplice
when he strung her up.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.208
Either way, it was a tough job.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.444
This guy had to leave
a piece of himself somewhere,

09:37.544 --> 09:38.812
but I don't know where to look.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.247
So, you want to...

09:40.347 --> 09:42.082
Run some trials.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.284
Will you donate
your body to science?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.025
Whoa.
All right.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.461
You good?
Yeah.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.529
All right.
Oh, Josh,

09:56.630 --> 09:58.231
I'm slipping.
I'm slipping.
What?

09:58.331 --> 09:59.566
All right.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.970
No.
No.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.672
Okay, can you help, uh...

10:04.772 --> 10:07.374
Here we go. You got it?

10:07.474 --> 10:08.709
I should not
have quit yoga.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.577
Let it swing... and over.

10:10.678 --> 10:13.113
Nice. Okay. Yes.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.485
We did it.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.987
Well, I think you
mean I did it.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.455
You were more of
a handsome tripod.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.458
All right,
you ready?
Mm-hmm.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.262
Here we go.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.764
You all right?
Yeah.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.033
So...

10:33.133 --> 10:34.567
I doubt that Diane

10:34.668 --> 10:36.469
was that amenable
to her killer.

10:37.570 --> 10:38.939
I doubt that she
was even alive.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.375
So, either he
had help, or...

10:42.475 --> 10:44.644
...we're looking
for Superman.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.480
Mr. Auerbach,
this is Maxine Roby,

10:47.580 --> 10:48.949
the director
of the crime lab.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.251
I'm so sorry for
your loss, sir.
Ah, thank you.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.821
But, truth be told,
I'm surprised you called.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.824
Me and Diane have been
separated almost two years.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.292
I thought she'd have somebody
else for next of kin.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.360
You moved out?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.796
Yeah, well, 20 years of having

11:02.896 --> 11:05.432
your every sigh psychoanalyzed
starts to grate.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.835
Did she grate on
anybody else?

11:07.935 --> 11:10.070
I thought you said
you'd met her.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.505
Look, Diane worked with
disturbed kids

11:12.605 --> 11:14.141
for most of
her career.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.943
Lot of them had
signs of psychopathy,

11:16.043 --> 11:17.344
and when they got worked up...

11:17.444 --> 11:19.379
Did you ever worry
for her safety?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.548
She had these creeps
traipsing through our house.

11:21.648 --> 11:22.615
I always thought
having a home office

11:22.716 --> 11:24.317
was a bad idea.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.920
She insisted they were safe.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.655
Was she ever concerned about
anybody in particular, or...

11:28.756 --> 11:30.290
No, she
was always

11:30.390 --> 11:31.591
very serious about privacy.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.493
I-I didn't even
know their names.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.262
Mr. Auerbach,
LVPD has a record

11:35.362 --> 11:37.664
of a domestic disturbance
call at Diane's address.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.767
Four years ago.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.601
You know the one.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.370
That was before the separation.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.671
We used to argue
something awful,

11:44.772 --> 11:46.339
but it was raised voices,
that's all.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.209
See, we're pretty sure
we're looking for a big guy.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.244
Your left arm could
feed a family of five

11:51.344 --> 11:52.645
for a week.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.048
Are you seriously suggesting...

11:55.148 --> 11:56.583
Yes, I am.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.386
I'm asking you where
you were last night

11:59.486 --> 12:01.621
from 8:00 to midnight.
Working out.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.590
I don't skip leg day.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.158
You don't believe me?

12:05.258 --> 12:06.226
Here, I even recorded

12:06.326 --> 12:07.660
a little for my, uh, trainer.

12:07.761 --> 12:10.663
She likes to
critique my form.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.033
Mm, okay.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.204
Tell me you got
something, Sonya.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.139
I'm starting to feel
like the grand marshal

12:19.239 --> 12:20.440
of a dead end parade.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.909
Well, I'm not sure any

12:22.009 --> 12:23.376
of what I have
is gonna crack the case,

12:23.476 --> 12:24.978
but I do
know two things.
Tell me.

12:25.078 --> 12:25.979
So, first thing:

12:26.079 --> 12:26.980
Lividity indicates

12:27.080 --> 12:28.448
that your victim
died upright.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.083
See this sort of
whitish discoloration

12:30.183 --> 12:31.684
on her buttocks and
the backs of her thighs?

12:31.785 --> 12:32.986
I would say that she was seated

12:33.086 --> 12:34.487
and she stayed that way
for a while.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.890
So, the killer
turned her upside down

12:36.990 --> 12:38.491
after she had
already died.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.960
Yes. But not immediately.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.261
Okay, what's
thing two?

12:41.361 --> 12:42.662
Okay, thing two: You see this

12:42.762 --> 12:45.933
sort of adhesive residue
around the wound?

12:47.034 --> 12:48.802
I would verify this with FTIR,

12:48.902 --> 12:51.338
but based off the strength
of this remaining residue,

12:51.438 --> 12:54.041
I would say that is
contractor-grade duct tape.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.876
Why it's there, though,
I have no idea.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.644
Maybe the killer wanted
to keep the wound from bleeding

12:57.744 --> 12:59.847
until the stage was set.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.918
Duct tape to
prevent blood flow.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.454
That is crude,
but it's effective.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.222
It's oddly fastidious.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.658
He's nothing
if he's not meticulous.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.593
He needs everything
to be just so.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.795
Yeah.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.130
Jack, you got to be

13:17.230 --> 13:19.632
more careful with
the specimen trays.

13:22.669 --> 13:23.937
Jack?

13:26.940 --> 13:27.807
Hey.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.809
Hey, excuse me!

13:29.910 --> 13:31.311
Hey! Security!

13:32.479 --> 13:34.114
Stop!

13:38.418 --> 13:40.253
He ran out the back door.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.955
Whoever that was, he shouldn't
have been in the crypt.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.323
I mean, unless he was lost.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.824
I don't...

13:45.792 --> 13:47.194
He left something behind.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.363
That was him?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.000
That was him.

13:55.768 --> 13:56.769
There.

13:56.870 --> 13:57.938
Okay, we've
got to be close.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.207
This is when Max
went into the morgue

14:00.307 --> 14:01.608
at 5:17 p.m.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.510
There he is.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.811
You got a different angle?

14:04.912 --> 14:08.615
5:34 p.m. He runs out
the loading dock doors

14:08.715 --> 14:10.283
and we lose him in the alley.
Darn it.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.751
We never see his face.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.920
All right, that's just how
he got out of the building.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.522
How did he get in?
Let me check.

14:15.622 --> 14:19.059
This reminds me of a
<i>Where's Waldo</i> nightmare I had.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.295
Candy cane striped hellscape.

14:24.597 --> 14:25.598
That's him, right?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.067
Dressed like a delivery guy?

14:27.167 --> 14:29.836
Must be how he wormed
his way past security.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.371
Where's the footage
from that elevator?

14:31.471 --> 14:32.672
There isn't any.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.007
Maintenance said that
those cameras

14:34.107 --> 14:35.375
are gonna get
fixed next week.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.678
But, if he got out
at the lobby level...

14:38.778 --> 14:40.747
Hold up.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.682
Is that Bryan?

14:44.017 --> 14:46.186
Almost, the chin
isn't quite right.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.193
A little bit sharper.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.872
So I think we have a sketch

15:05.973 --> 15:08.341
of a stick figure in a hat.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.642
I don't think
my guy has the chops

15:09.742 --> 15:10.777
to get what
Bryan's giving him.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.379
Any DNA on the note?

15:12.479 --> 15:13.646
Yes, indeed.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.881
We got a name
and a police report.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.916
Modi Subramaniam.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.285
Ooh, a 92-year-old
with a record.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.520
Felony assault, 2017.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.923
Hit a teenager in a grocery
store parking lot with his cane.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.092
Okay, you're
not telling me

15:25.192 --> 15:26.426
Bad Grandpa outran you,
are you?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.428
I think our
silver ink-obsessed killer

15:28.528 --> 15:31.999
used an envelope with
this old man's DNA on it.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.300
I think we
should find out

15:33.400 --> 15:34.467
if he's trying to
show us something.

15:36.736 --> 15:37.971
So, our homeowner, Modi,

15:38.071 --> 15:40.707
he is pretty spry for
a 92-year-old felon.

15:40.807 --> 15:41.975
Lives out
in Palm Springs

15:42.075 --> 15:43.876
with a couple lady friends.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.078
Rents this place out.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.014
Any information
about his tenant?

15:47.114 --> 15:48.115
Description
he gave was

15:48.215 --> 15:49.316
"some young
white guy."

15:49.416 --> 15:50.917
Goes by
"Mike Smith."
Hmm.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.885
Narrows it down.
Yeah, few hundred

15:52.986 --> 15:54.254
Mike Smiths in Vegas,
but this one

15:54.354 --> 15:56.489
paid six months' rent
up front in cash.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.225
I'm guessing Modi

15:58.325 --> 15:59.626
didn't ask
too many questions.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.431
You know, he insisted
on a video call

16:04.531 --> 16:06.366
when he heard my voice.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.102
He said "anything
for a lady cop

16:09.202 --> 16:10.170
with very
pretty eyes."

16:10.270 --> 16:11.638
Ooh.
So I have an open

16:11.738 --> 16:12.972
invitation to
Palm Springs,

16:13.073 --> 16:14.574
and we have permission
to look around.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.708
Well, let's not keep you

16:15.808 --> 16:17.444
from that poolside
margarita, huh?

16:19.346 --> 16:21.548
Somebody ran a cable
to that structure.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.882
Yup.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.218
Maybe an ADU?

16:25.318 --> 16:26.586
I'm over here.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.587
Not much of a view,
though, huh?

16:27.687 --> 16:30.190
No, there isn't.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.392
Catherine...

16:33.860 --> 16:36.896
These symbols, they're symbols

16:36.996 --> 16:39.232
like those postcards
we've been getting.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.435
Homeowner says
we can go in.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.356
I think we found your pen pal.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.999
You have any luck
decoding this stuff?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.135
Allie's been working on it.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.537
Beau dabbles. But nothing yet.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.174
I mean,

17:21.274 --> 17:23.510
maybe it's just lorem ipsum.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.978
Like it means nothing?

17:27.147 --> 17:29.282
That really would be crazy.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.052
Oh, my God.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.588
Get out, get out!

17:35.688 --> 17:37.257
Come on, get out!

17:40.393 --> 17:42.729
You okay?
Yeah. I'm fine. Max?

17:42.829 --> 17:44.063
Are you okay?

17:44.164 --> 17:45.298
I hit the light switch.
It was rigged.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.933
Dispatch, I need LVFD

17:47.033 --> 17:48.735
at my current location
in Boulder City now.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.970
I got a case going up in smoke.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.173
Damn it!

17:58.778 --> 18:01.013
I know. Our evidence

18:01.114 --> 18:02.014
got flambéed.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.916
I don't want
to hear a word

18:04.016 --> 18:05.318
about this case
being jinxed.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.619
I never should have touched

18:06.719 --> 18:08.121
that damn light switch.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.589
Oh, it's okay, boss.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.990
It's not as if it's our
first crispy crime scene.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.659
Yeah, if I'd
seen it first,

18:12.759 --> 18:14.060
I would've done
the same damn thing.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.296
This psycho was probably
counting on it.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.498
And his little booby trap

18:18.598 --> 18:20.133
could be exactly
what helps us find him.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.469
I want every piece
of this ignition mechanism,

18:22.569 --> 18:24.604
anything that remotely
looks like

18:24.704 --> 18:25.772
it belongs to it, Catherine.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.106
Bag and tag it. I'm on it.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.608
This was a controlled burn.

18:28.708 --> 18:29.976
He wanted us to find something.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.678
Allie, I want
you to look at

18:31.778 --> 18:33.313
every piece of paper,

18:33.413 --> 18:34.547
everything in the drawers

18:34.647 --> 18:35.582
and anything that looks like

18:35.682 --> 18:36.916
it survived this fire.

18:37.016 --> 18:37.884
Got it.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.085
I'll see if I
can make sense

18:39.186 --> 18:40.720
of what's left
of these scribbles.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.655
Yeah, you do,
we'll buy you a steak dinner

18:42.755 --> 18:43.890
at the Palazzo, how's that?

18:43.990 --> 18:45.192
Really?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.474
Hey, you guys.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.243
Penny was right.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.412
What?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.646
The guy who engineered this,

19:06.746 --> 19:09.081
they were watching us.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.683
Max.
Yeah.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.219
You need
to see this.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.020
What?

19:19.926 --> 19:22.495
You are running trace
analysis on a card

19:22.595 --> 19:25.064
that's literally
ordering your murder.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.766
That is the job, Joshua.

19:26.866 --> 19:30.537
Not when some psychopath has
put a target on your back.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.038
How many people got
that card with your name?

19:32.138 --> 19:33.340
You wanna end up
back in the hospital?

19:33.440 --> 19:34.941
Or worse? I can't imagine

19:35.041 --> 19:36.209
that you want to go
through that again.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.744
I know I don't.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.846
My name on one of those cards

19:39.946 --> 19:41.981
is totally off-pattern.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.384
Who's been the target so far?

19:44.484 --> 19:46.919
Every other Silver Ink
case has been

19:47.019 --> 19:49.422
one troubled person
being sent after another.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.823
So putting my name
in the mix...

19:50.923 --> 19:52.225
It's a desperate move.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.561
He's panicking.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.028
We're close,

19:56.128 --> 19:57.430
and he's worried,

19:57.530 --> 19:59.932
and worried people
make mistakes.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.035
Max, come on.

20:03.135 --> 20:06.038
You cannot just be chum
in the water for some lunatic.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.708
You want me
to be safe?
Yeah.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.042
Then let's find out
everything we can

20:10.142 --> 20:11.878
about this guy and
get him off the streets.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.315
She has to handle it her way.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.716
You will be an invited guest

20:16.816 --> 20:17.917
at an LVPD safe house
until this is over.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.587
Actually, I have a better idea.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.054
You know, I'm really
not too wild about

20:22.154 --> 20:24.056
how often people are
trying to kill you, Mom.

20:24.156 --> 20:27.394
It's starting to feel
like a trend, isn't it?

20:27.494 --> 20:28.661
So, what do we do?

20:28.761 --> 20:31.598
I need you to get
two rooms at the Aurora.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.333
One for me,
one for you.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.934
Use fake names, okay?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.536
Like we're in witness
protection?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.671
It's not perfect, I know that,

20:38.771 --> 20:41.941
but LVPD is gonna post unis
outside our rooms.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.943
We'll have
Aurora's CCTV network

20:44.043 --> 20:46.646
as added security, and you'll
be able to go to work.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.148
Mom? This sucks.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.650
I know.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.722
I'll set it up.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.224
All right. Thank you.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.526
Oh, hey, I got
something to show you.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.193
What you got?

21:01.294 --> 21:05.064
I didn't really see much of
this guy's face, but I saw this.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.305
<i>He's got a scar on his arm.</i>

21:13.873 --> 21:15.308
What happened to
that stick figure?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.143
Oh, you know I had to do
a little somethin' somethin'.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.278
You want something done right,
you got to do it yourself.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.549
I'm sorry to interrupt,
boss, but you should

21:22.649 --> 21:23.716
come take a look at this.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.617
We were able to jigsaw

21:24.717 --> 21:25.918
some usable prints

21:26.018 --> 21:27.854
from the partials we
pulled at Diane's cabin.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.557
Okay, Pen, a judge
is gonna throw this out

21:30.657 --> 21:32.124
at the mention
of the word "jigsaw."

21:32.224 --> 21:33.426
No, we know.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.194
But don't you want
to meet your matches?

21:36.563 --> 21:37.964
Matches? Plural?

21:40.967 --> 21:42.669
Whatever you think I did,

21:42.769 --> 21:44.036
it's not true, I've
never done anything...

21:44.136 --> 21:46.373
We just have a few
questions, Juan Carlos.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.875
Your prints are on file

21:48.975 --> 21:50.477
from your
asylum application.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.844
Me and Juan Carlos,

21:51.944 --> 21:53.780
we've been picking up
construction jobs.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.715
We've been working all the time.
It's been amazing.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.083
It's been terrible.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.585
Have you met the people
that live here?

21:58.685 --> 21:59.986
They're all degenerates.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.689
What exactly
were you building

22:02.789 --> 22:04.424
out by Lake Spring
Mountain, Mister...

22:04.524 --> 22:06.092
Uh, Hester.

22:06.192 --> 22:07.560
Ted Hester.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.328
And it was a boat ramp.

22:09.429 --> 22:12.031
That old dock is in
pretty rough shape.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.834
And you just hired a couple
of day laborers to help?

22:14.934 --> 22:16.936
Yeah, I got a bum shoulder,

22:17.036 --> 22:18.805
so I can't do any heavy lifting.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.440
This was months ago now,

22:20.540 --> 22:21.841
but I remember the boss
on this paid in cash.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.843
Said we'd get to
work by the lake.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.978
Better than the desert.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.014
How long were
you out there?

22:28.114 --> 22:30.249
We didn't see
a boat ramp.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.952
We never finished.
Barely even started.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.487
Boss said the old lady
that used to live there,

22:34.587 --> 22:35.955
she went into a home.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.323
<i>Not to be a jerk,</i>

22:37.424 --> 22:39.258
but no money,
no boat ramp, you know?

22:39.358 --> 22:41.528
Where were you night
before last?

22:41.628 --> 22:43.329
Lotería. I'm a cantor

22:43.430 --> 22:46.866
at Señorita Margarita's
twice a week.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.134
<i>He's actually very good.</i>

22:48.234 --> 22:49.602
Won a hundred dollars
that night.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.771
I was at home
watching the Lakers.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.341
They got to trade 'Bron, man.
Blow it up. Get some picks.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.044
Yeah. Uh, well, if
you have anything else...

22:58.144 --> 22:59.846
There is one
thing, actually.

22:59.946 --> 23:02.348
I remember seeing a pickup

23:02.449 --> 23:04.116
out at the cabin.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.485
It was an extended
cab, white.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.820
Had a supertop over the bed.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.155
Saw it a couple times.

23:09.255 --> 23:12.324
If anybody got close,
it just took off.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.761
Well, thank you,
Mr. Hester.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.095
All right.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.133
I didn't see any
scars on their arms,

23:21.233 --> 23:22.769
but the file on Bob Auerbach
says he drives

23:22.869 --> 23:24.236
a white truck
that sounds pretty similar.

23:24.336 --> 23:27.139
Along with a thousand other
Vegas residents.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.443
I was thinking
about the boat ramp.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.744
Mm-hmm?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.613
The summer I was 17,
I dated this girl

23:33.713 --> 23:34.814
whose family had money.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.949
Oh, I bet her dad loved you.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.751
No.
Mm-hmm.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.086
But he had a boat
that needed repairs,

23:40.186 --> 23:42.388
and I helped him
haul it out of Lake Tahoe.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.323
I think I need
to go find a hoist.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.763
Oh, hey, Al...

23:50.863 --> 23:51.898
Uh, hey.
No, it's me.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.432
Allie texted.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.801
She's still at
the white room scene,

23:54.901 --> 23:56.469
but she said you needed help.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.873
Mm, okay.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.380
Ha-ha.
Now we're talking.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.983
We might not be looking
for a powerlifter,

24:11.083 --> 24:12.719
just a guy
with a powerful lifter.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.453
But I thought you said
there was no sign

24:14.554 --> 24:16.155
that a pulley was used,

24:16.255 --> 24:19.125
and wouldn't a hoist like this
have to be pulled from above?

24:19.225 --> 24:21.761
on top of the flagpole?
Were there any markings

24:21.861 --> 24:23.195
Uh...

24:23.295 --> 24:25.732
There's no sign of anything
being disturbed

24:25.832 --> 24:26.733
except for that
little void in the paint

24:26.833 --> 24:28.267
where Diane was hanging.

24:28.367 --> 24:31.738
Well, maybe he hooked up
a motorized device to...

24:31.838 --> 24:33.606
I don't know,
something tall

24:33.706 --> 24:35.708
that isn't
there anymore?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.910
Maybe.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.512
I think we need to
get back to the crime scene

24:39.612 --> 24:40.680
for another look.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.348
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, totally.

24:42.448 --> 24:44.551
Could I be right side up
for that?

24:45.952 --> 24:47.386
Oh, yeah.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.592
Hey, Beau. Hey.

24:52.692 --> 24:53.926
Anything useful?

24:54.026 --> 24:55.227
You have components

24:55.327 --> 24:56.529
of the ignition device, accelerant.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.264
I mean, it's all
stuff that contractors,

24:58.364 --> 24:59.966
repair folk, your odd
DIY-er could buy

25:00.066 --> 25:01.367
at a hardware store
on a regular basis.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.836
So we'd be hard-pressed
to trace any of it

25:03.936 --> 25:05.337
back to an individual.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.939
Yeah, even before
it went up in flames.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.641
Damn. I...

25:08.741 --> 25:10.076
just was really hoping

25:10.176 --> 25:11.578
this was going to end
our evidence drought.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.713
There's got to be something
that we're missing.

25:13.813 --> 25:16.148
The thing I keep coming back to

25:16.248 --> 25:17.684
are these crazy
symbols on the walls.

25:17.784 --> 25:18.951
Allie and I, we haven't

25:19.051 --> 25:20.186
cracked the postcards,
but maybe

25:20.286 --> 25:21.320
there's something there
we haven't seen.

25:21.420 --> 25:22.454
Like what?

25:22.555 --> 25:23.556
A pattern.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.057
A clue to the cipher.
I don't know,

25:25.157 --> 25:26.425
but something that could get us

25:26.525 --> 25:27.994
to the bastard
who is threatening Max.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.197
I just... I can't really tell.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.399
Well, maybe you need to
get back in the saddle.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.202
I mean, if you think there's
something at the crime scene

25:36.302 --> 25:38.805
that could help Max, you're not
going to find it in a lab

25:38.905 --> 25:40.873
on the other
side of town.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.412
Oh.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.048
Well, well, well,

25:49.148 --> 25:50.917
if it isn't a rare
sighting of Beau Finado

25:51.017 --> 25:52.819
out in the wild.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.253
Don't get excited,

25:54.353 --> 25:56.088
this is a temporary
state of affairs.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.457
Nope. Sorry,
I'm getting excited.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.926
You can't stop me.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.161
Look, I'm just here
to get a better look

26:02.261 --> 26:03.529
at the stuff
that's on the walls.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.431
Yeah, the silver scribbles.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.967
I've been trying to make them
out through the soot all day.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.435
Well, Beau brought something

26:09.535 --> 26:12.138
that might make it
a little easier.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.940
You know I love my latex.

26:31.357 --> 26:35.427
Guys... I found something weird.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.563
Well, weirder.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.438
Well...

26:46.538 --> 26:49.942
it's not exactly
a secret decoder ring,

26:50.042 --> 26:51.577
but it's something.

26:51.678 --> 26:54.113
Richard Sloan,
Alan Herskovitz...

26:54.213 --> 26:55.147
I don't know
what I'm looking at,

26:55.247 --> 26:56.215
but I know I don't like it.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.650
Whoever's behind

26:57.750 --> 26:58.885
the Silver Ink murders,

26:58.985 --> 27:00.653
this is part of their plan.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.122
We're not just looking at
a few connected crimes.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.724
What do you see, Allie?

27:04.824 --> 27:06.592
It's a wheel.

27:07.593 --> 27:11.664
This whole time, we've been
watching a wheel of death spin.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.700
This is his plan.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.069
This is his
whole game plan.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.177
Your big old board of crazy

27:25.277 --> 27:27.013
looks a lot less crazy.
What happened?

27:27.113 --> 27:29.281
We found something under
the soot at the fire scene.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.383
Beau's liquid latex trick
gave us a clean look.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.019
That ouroboros
and the names around it

27:33.119 --> 27:34.921
helped me realize
what it is

27:35.021 --> 27:36.422
that we're
really looking at.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.524
A game.
A game?

27:38.624 --> 27:40.693
You ever play
Assassin, boss?

27:40.793 --> 27:42.294
We used to play it
at university

27:42.394 --> 27:43.395
with Nerf guns.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.630
Players are
assigned a target,

27:44.731 --> 27:46.498
and once they eliminate one,
they inherit

27:46.598 --> 27:49.001
that player's target
as their next assignment.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.336
It's just a complicated
game of tag.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.337
You go after me,
I go after Allie,

27:51.437 --> 27:52.905
Allie goes
after you...

27:53.005 --> 27:54.073
It's fun.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.641
If you're playing
with Nerf bullets.

27:55.742 --> 27:56.675
Are you sure about this?

27:56.776 --> 27:58.344
Mm-hmm. The snake

27:58.444 --> 27:59.545
eats its own tail.

27:59.645 --> 28:00.646
The wheel rolls until

28:00.747 --> 28:02.214
only one remains.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.883
And everybody else ends up dead.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.317
I mean, all these poor,
sick folks.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.786
Who would want
to kill all these people?

28:06.886 --> 28:09.055
And who dreams up
something like this?

28:09.155 --> 28:10.389
You know what?

28:10.489 --> 28:12.658
No more games. Get me a suspect.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.705
No holes, no disturbed earth.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.440
Whatever kind of rig
he used to get her up there

28:28.540 --> 28:30.409
had to be anchored
to something,

28:30.509 --> 28:32.779
but I wouldn't even begin to
know where to look for trace.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.483
I'm not the superstitious type,

28:37.583 --> 28:39.618
but even I'm
starting to think that...

28:39.718 --> 28:42.021
think that this case
is cursed. Hey, Penny,

28:42.121 --> 28:43.756
be careful, that dock
looks pretty rough.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.025
Hey, hey, hey... Wow.

28:46.826 --> 28:47.960
Hey, look at this.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.728
The base is rusty,
but not on top.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.663
Yeah, you're right,
it's like the top section's

28:51.764 --> 28:52.832
been scraped clean.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.134
Something was
on that post.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.771
Like a... Like a mount
for a boat winch?

28:58.871 --> 29:01.140
A hand crank to pull
a boat out of the water.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.375
Usually, they're mounted
on a trailer,

29:03.475 --> 29:04.510
but if there was...

29:04.610 --> 29:07.613
If there was one here...

29:07.713 --> 29:09.816
Yeah, that's
how he did it solo.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.117
There'd be no
accomplice needed.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.684
He could just
hoist Diane's body

29:12.785 --> 29:13.685
into place from here.

29:13.786 --> 29:14.921
But there's no way

29:15.021 --> 29:17.323
her body was pulled
from this angle.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.325
And the friction from
a rope pulling her weight

29:19.425 --> 29:22.761
over the crossbar would have
stripped off more paint, right?

29:22.862 --> 29:24.563
Yeah.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.368
Maybe not, if there was
a different anchor point.

30:01.433 --> 30:02.601
Got something?

30:03.502 --> 30:05.905
I think we already
had something.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.639
I think we have
the smoking gun at the lab.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.808
Damn it.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.210
I thought our luck
was changing.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.845
So did I.

30:12.945 --> 30:15.514
We found a fiber at the scene
from this snag in the bungee.

30:15.614 --> 30:16.916
I know he used it.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.750
There's a couple
of rope fibers

30:18.851 --> 30:20.019
trapped in this coil here.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.888
He didn't have enough rope

30:21.988 --> 30:24.924
to haul her up.
Uh-huh.

30:25.757 --> 30:26.792
So he used that

30:26.893 --> 30:28.060
to make up
the difference.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.862
Pretty sure,
but there's no DNA here.

30:29.962 --> 30:33.599
So, what happens
when you attach...

30:33.699 --> 30:36.735
weight to the end of a bungee?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.637
It stretches. Exactly.

30:38.737 --> 30:41.473
And when you
stretch a bungee cord,

30:41.573 --> 30:44.310
it expose more surface area

30:44.410 --> 30:46.012
that could catch DNA.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.114
It would be hard work

30:48.214 --> 30:49.715
stretching
the bungee that far.

30:49.815 --> 30:52.351
I broke a sweat just doing
a spiral search with Penny.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.054
<i>Maybe our killer sweated, too.</i>

30:55.154 --> 30:57.023
Come on.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.281
Damn.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.482
No match in CODIS.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.517
We're not done yet, Joshua.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.019
Met this fella,

31:27.119 --> 31:30.389
this brilliant scientist
at a genetics conference.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.924
He's from the Netherlands.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.693
And he has new research

31:34.793 --> 31:36.929
that expands what
you can predict

31:37.029 --> 31:38.897
from a DNA assay.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.000
How detailed
can you get?

31:41.100 --> 31:42.401
Give me 20 minutes
with your genome

31:42.501 --> 31:44.103
and I could tell you
whether your hairline

31:44.203 --> 31:45.304
will survive the next decade.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.573
As for our
sweaty suspect,

31:47.673 --> 31:49.041
a male of average height...

31:49.141 --> 31:51.777
Probably not Diane's ex.
I heard he was

31:51.877 --> 31:53.145
a tall drink
of protein shake.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.647
And he very likely
has heterochromia.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.183
Different colored eyes?

31:57.283 --> 31:58.750
That mean something to you?

31:59.551 --> 32:01.954
Blow it up.
Get some picks. Right?

32:02.054 --> 32:03.822
Yeah, it means our guy also has

32:03.922 --> 32:05.791
a bum shoulder
and a shaky alibi.

32:05.891 --> 32:08.294
So, when we
bring him in,

32:08.394 --> 32:09.928
all I need you
to tell me

32:10.029 --> 32:12.198
is whether it's the man
you saw in the elevator.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.833
Yes, ma'am.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.435
You're mighty popular.

32:16.535 --> 32:17.903
Oh, it's just Dad.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.705
He's texting me
his flight details.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.240
Where's he going now?

32:21.340 --> 32:23.175
I may have mentioned
that we're hiding out

32:23.275 --> 32:25.844
from a crazy axe murderer
or whatever.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.080
Hmm?
I was really
worried about you,

32:28.180 --> 32:29.548
and it just
kind of slipped out.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.350
And you know Dad.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.985
He booked a flight
to Vegas before we

32:33.085 --> 32:35.054
even got off the phone.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.990
That's okay.
I mean, yeah, it's okay.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.458
It's... No...

32:39.558 --> 32:41.927
It's okay, it's okay.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.805
You lied to us, Ted.

32:53.905 --> 32:55.774
You told us you
were a contractor,

32:55.874 --> 32:58.410
hired to build a boat ramp.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.212
You don't have
a contractor's license.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.848
According to the State
of Nevada, you never did.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.851
I guess I'm more
of a casual handyman.

33:05.951 --> 33:08.420
That doesn't explain why
the two day laborers

33:08.520 --> 33:10.389
who worked at the property
don't recognize you.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.523
How about you?

33:11.623 --> 33:13.592
You recognize him?

33:13.692 --> 33:15.594
You never worked at that cabin.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.263
No.
You just played along
to make us think

33:17.363 --> 33:18.630
you were supposed to be there.
Are you sure?

33:18.730 --> 33:20.899
That's not the guy I saw.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.470
This is what you designed.

33:24.570 --> 33:29.241
A real-life game of Assassin.
You took advantage

33:29.341 --> 33:31.410
of troubled, potentially
violent individuals

33:31.510 --> 33:32.711
and blackmailed them

33:32.811 --> 33:34.280
into taking
each other out.

33:35.281 --> 33:36.915
Sounds like a good plan.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.685
I'm sorry,
but it does.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.154
I mean, takes out the trash,
does humanity a favor,

33:42.254 --> 33:43.855
keeps everyone's hands clean.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.092
You think
your hands are clean?

33:46.192 --> 33:48.694
Whoever did this,

33:48.794 --> 33:50.729
I don't know, should
get a medal or something,

33:50.829 --> 33:52.464
but it wasn't me.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.066
Uh, Ted...

33:54.166 --> 33:55.334
You don't have any proof.

33:55.434 --> 33:56.835
Oh, no, that's
where you're wrong.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.370
We pulled DNA from
this bungee cord.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.672
<i>A man with heterochromia
sweat on it</i>

34:00.772 --> 34:02.641
<i>while he was
stringing up Diane Auerbach.</i>

34:02.741 --> 34:03.709
Bet it matches you.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.212
Okay, so, I touched

34:06.312 --> 34:08.680
a bungee cord on a jobsite.

34:08.780 --> 34:09.681
I'm not
denying that.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.049
Cut the crap, Ted.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.418
You blackmailed
these people

34:12.518 --> 34:13.852
to get them
to kill each other,

34:13.952 --> 34:15.187
and when we started

34:15.287 --> 34:16.988
to get too close,
you decided to go after

34:17.089 --> 34:18.457
the director of the crime lab

34:18.557 --> 34:20.025
Max Roby.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.464
Is Maxine watching right now?

34:26.865 --> 34:28.200
Gotcha.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.569
How'd you know "Max"
was short for "Maxine"?

34:33.439 --> 34:35.707
You think you're the smartest
one in the room, don't you?

34:35.807 --> 34:38.477
I wouldn't
bet on that.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.613
Guess we'll find out
which one of us is right.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.160
Belly of the beast.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.195
Yeah, here we are.

34:57.129 --> 35:00.566
In a serial killer's house.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.067
Sure missed this.

35:02.168 --> 35:03.435
Let's just hope Mr. Hester
doesn't keep his house

35:03.535 --> 35:04.970
as clean as his crime scene.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.980
Hope it's a good omen this time.

35:46.111 --> 35:47.746
Chavez.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.148
What's that?

36:25.784 --> 36:28.320
You saw a flourishing
patch of cucumbers

36:28.420 --> 36:30.889
and thought, "Bet there's
a body under there."

36:30.989 --> 36:33.158
Excuse me, nitrogen
from decaying tissue

36:33.259 --> 36:35.193
can cause increased
chlorophyll production

36:35.294 --> 36:37.296
in plants growing over
a shallow grave.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.030
And, if you'd seen the drawings,

36:39.130 --> 36:40.966
you would've thought the same.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.101
Folsom.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.009
Grandma?

36:53.812 --> 36:55.080
You told
your neighbors

36:55.180 --> 36:57.048
that your grandmother
moved to Sarasota,

36:57.148 --> 36:59.751
but she never
left home, did she?

37:02.220 --> 37:03.922
Did your granny know

37:04.022 --> 37:06.492
about your
twisted little fantasies?

37:06.592 --> 37:07.793
She was the one who sent me

37:07.893 --> 37:09.495
to Dr. Auerbach
in the first place.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.697
She promised I'd get better.

37:11.797 --> 37:14.500
And for years, I thought I did.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.436
Changed my
pattern of thought,

37:17.536 --> 37:18.637
like Auerbach said.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.840
I could control the urges.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.644
Until you couldn't.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.013
She was just skin and bone.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.549
Just one
little knock to the head

37:30.649 --> 37:34.686
and she went down so... easy.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.288
Why?

37:37.289 --> 37:38.957
Why not?

37:42.193 --> 37:43.962
What about
Diane Auerbach, hmm?

37:44.062 --> 37:45.531
Well, she was
supposed to fix me.

37:45.631 --> 37:46.898
But she failed, clearly.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.834
But why kill her now?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.169
You.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.604
You did that.

37:52.704 --> 37:56.842
You were talking to her,
making her think.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.711
She called me.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.380
She suspected.

38:02.548 --> 38:03.582
It was you we saw

38:03.682 --> 38:05.083
at her house. Yeah.

38:05.183 --> 38:07.919
I had to clean up everything
that she had on me.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.857
It took a little... convincing,

38:11.957 --> 38:14.993
but she told me
where to find it all.

38:15.093 --> 38:17.095
<i>So we were getting close.</i>

38:17.195 --> 38:18.697
<i>And you had to move fast.</i>

38:35.547 --> 38:37.683
But you still couldn't
resist the urge

38:37.783 --> 38:38.850
<i>to stage your scene</i>

38:38.950 --> 38:40.018
<i>just like those fantasies</i>

38:40.118 --> 38:41.853
<i>that you couldn't shake.</i>

38:44.690 --> 38:47.559
I was born with these fantasies.

38:47.659 --> 38:48.927
They're as much a part of me

38:49.027 --> 38:50.929
as your left hand
is a part of you.

38:52.063 --> 38:55.734
Death lives inside of me.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.069
Why not use that?

38:58.169 --> 39:00.071
What do you mean, use it?

39:00.171 --> 39:03.174
I knew I could make
the world a better place.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.745
I knew I could...

39:06.845 --> 39:08.179
cull the rotten fruit.

39:08.279 --> 39:11.182
You stole files
from Diane Auerbach

39:11.282 --> 39:12.618
and other child psychiatrists.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.787
No, these doctors,
the Auerbachs,

39:15.887 --> 39:17.556
the-the Sarkisians,
the rest,

39:17.656 --> 39:19.190
they think they can help,
but my way is better.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.527
I found people like me,

39:21.627 --> 39:24.863
and I used the death inside
them to solve the problem.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.032
So, you set the wheel rolling.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.867
One kills the next,
kills the next,

39:28.967 --> 39:30.702
and on and on until
there's only one left.

39:30.802 --> 39:33.371
Alan Herskovitz,
Richard Sloan...

39:34.540 --> 39:35.774
It was in them all along.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.809
They all killed
with just a tiny push.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.911
I'd hardly call blackmail
a tiny push.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.747
Also, what about
the other people?

39:41.847 --> 39:43.715
<i>Lynn Zobrist, Lamont Moore.</i>

39:43.815 --> 39:44.750
<i>Molly Tate.</i>

39:44.850 --> 39:46.117
I mean, none of those people

39:46.217 --> 39:47.986
were going to be
pushed to murder. Right?

39:48.086 --> 39:49.621
I'm not batting a thousand,

39:49.721 --> 39:53.158
but none of them were going
to be president of the PTA,

39:53.258 --> 39:54.560
right?

39:54.660 --> 39:57.062
No one is going to miss them.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.369
We're missing something.

40:05.303 --> 40:06.738
He's giving us everything.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.507
Not yet.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.809
I would like to ask you about

40:10.909 --> 40:13.879
these cards.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.213
This writing here.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.484
I can't tell you
anything about that.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.219
I didn't write those.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.788
I have no idea what that means.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.756
You see this guy?

40:24.856 --> 40:27.759
In the white room,

40:27.859 --> 40:29.728
these squiggly...
symbols?

40:29.828 --> 40:31.429
That's not me.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.400
That's my MVP.

40:38.504 --> 40:40.071
Okay, Ted,

40:40.171 --> 40:41.507
there's no reason
for you to lie.

40:41.607 --> 40:42.508
We're late in the game.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.042
I'm telling you the truth.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.044
And you're right,

40:46.144 --> 40:48.113
I have no reason not to.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.918
I set out to
find people like me.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.319
Potential serial killers.

40:54.419 --> 40:56.254
And I did.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.289
I found a real champ.

40:58.389 --> 41:01.026
And even though
I'm in here,

41:01.126 --> 41:03.228
he's out there,
playing the game.

41:04.062 --> 41:08.033
And he's going to
win by a landslide.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.670
He claims the white room

41:11.770 --> 41:13.104
isn't his.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.806
I don't think
he's lying.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.975
The DNA we found in the white
room doesn't match Ted Hester.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.578
What? Whose is it?

41:20.546 --> 41:21.747
<i>So that was the plan,</i>

41:21.847 --> 41:22.881
<i>to take out the last man</i>

41:22.981 --> 41:24.716
<i>standing yourself, huh?</i>

41:24.816 --> 41:26.284
<i>Of course.</i>

41:26.384 --> 41:29.555
<i>But you made that
pretty impossible, so...</i>

41:29.655 --> 41:30.622
<i>I gave my best player</i>

41:30.722 --> 41:32.190
<i>a real challenge.</i>

41:46.004 --> 41:48.940
You're all in the game now.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.610
May the best man win.
