The Simpsons S19E13 (KABF06)
- The Debarted -

00:05.779 --> 00:08.733
The art teacher is fat, not pregnant.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.764
Ow! Mom, Lisa hit me!

00:58.765 --> 01:00.066
I did not!

01:00.067 --> 01:01.521
Kids, knock it off.

01:01.522 --> 01:05.031
I'm uncomfortable driving
your father's car as it is.

01:05.032 --> 01:06.801
Taxicab License.

01:06.802 --> 01:07.977
What the...?

01:12.515 --> 01:15.913
Fine! We'll divide the car
into your side and my side.

01:15.917 --> 01:17.320
My leg is the barrier.

01:19.053 --> 01:20.139
Mom!

01:20.137 --> 01:21.499
The system works!

01:25.488 --> 01:26.775
It's not funny!

01:26.779 --> 01:28.511
Your wearing cleats!

01:31.357 --> 01:33.630
Stop it! Stop it!

01:48.027 --> 01:49.203
Sorry I'm late...

01:49.267 --> 01:50.581
I was in a car crash.

01:50.585 --> 01:53.051
Many hurt,
but nobody cool was harmed.

01:53.056 --> 01:54.782
Just sit down, Bart.

01:54.836 --> 01:55.822
Huh?!

01:58.135 --> 01:59.551
Who's the new
meat in my seat?

01:59.556 --> 02:00.773
Bart, this is Donny...

02:00.777 --> 02:04.123
he's here at our school because
he was kicked out of P.S. 132.

02:04.126 --> 02:06.161
P.S. That school sucked.

02:07.648 --> 02:08.901
Don't worry, Bart,

02:08.906 --> 02:11.122
Willie's bringing you
something to sit on.

02:18.075 --> 02:19.281
Hey, Krabappel,

02:19.287 --> 02:21.421
your name sounds
like "crab apple."

02:21.426 --> 02:23.830
Did you go sour waiting
for someone to pick you?

02:24.005 --> 02:25.122
Pretty much.

02:30.135 --> 02:31.201
Huh?

02:43.096 --> 02:45.971
Isn't he awesome?

02:45.975 --> 02:48.901
When he grows up,
I want to be like me!

02:50.375 --> 02:51.711
Look, new kid,

02:51.716 --> 02:54.382
I'm the head hamster in
this habitrail, capisce?

02:54.385 --> 02:56.851
Well, maybe there's a new
guinea pig in your cage.

02:56.856 --> 02:58.081
Capisce that?

02:58.086 --> 02:59.542
Oh, I capisce.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.401
I capisce just fine.

03:01.407 --> 03:04.140
Oh, well, you just
keep on capisce-ing.

03:11.986 --> 03:13.932
See-saw!

03:16.266 --> 03:19.202
Mr. Simpson, this damage
will take a week to fix.

03:19.207 --> 03:22.441
While your car's in the shop,
uh, you can drive this loaner.

03:23.358 --> 03:25.330
Loa... ner?

03:25.396 --> 03:26.612
She's right here.

03:27.845 --> 03:30.631
This is the kind of car
you see in commercials!

03:30.677 --> 03:33.093
How much am I
paying for this?

03:33.097 --> 03:35.642
- Nothing.
- Hm, it seems like a lot.

03:35.655 --> 03:36.553
On the contrary.

03:36.558 --> 03:39.243
The loaner car is complimentary.
It's standard policy.

03:39.248 --> 03:40.792
Really? Oh!

03:41.127 --> 03:43.141
You people are idiots!

03:47.036 --> 03:48.273
That's the dumb...

03:51.258 --> 03:52.712
What a stu...

03:53.765 --> 03:55.170
I mean, that sounds fair.

03:55.387 --> 03:56.602
Okay, so...

03:59.137 --> 04:01.173
Look at you!
Idiots!

04:02.896 --> 04:05.243
Driver of a loaner car

04:05.248 --> 04:06.691
Much better than a

04:06.696 --> 04:08.962
Driver of my normal car...

04:11.917 --> 04:14.161
Whoa! Fancy wheels!

04:14.166 --> 04:15.750
What song does the horn play?

04:15.755 --> 04:16.732
None.

04:16.737 --> 04:17.853
Classy.

04:19.125 --> 04:19.632
Wha...?

04:19.635 --> 04:21.731
Hey, boy, check out
my new car... huh?

04:26.316 --> 04:27.260
Cut it out!

04:27.267 --> 04:28.802
Want to take a ride
with your old man?

04:28.815 --> 04:29.381
No.

04:29.386 --> 04:32.142
Come on!
Come on!

04:32.148 --> 04:34.200
Oh, come on!

04:34.206 --> 04:35.673
Oh, fine.

04:39.987 --> 04:41.593
What's the matter, son?

04:41.608 --> 04:42.611
There's this new kid

04:42.615 --> 04:44.793
at school who everyone thinks
is cooler than me.

04:44.805 --> 04:46.323
Aw, don't give up, boy!

04:46.328 --> 04:49.152
I believe in you, and not
just because I have to.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.082
Really, Dad?

04:50.088 --> 04:53.492
Son, I know when we first met,
we didn't really hit it off,

04:53.495 --> 04:56.652
but since then I've really
come to respect you.

04:56.656 --> 04:59.993
And unlike love,
respect can't be bought.

04:59.998 --> 05:00.833
You're right.

05:00.835 --> 05:03.731
I'm gonna go to school tomorrow
and show everyone I'm awesome.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.091
That's my boy.

05:05.095 --> 05:07.881
Now let's watch the air
conditioner fight the heater.

05:12.426 --> 05:14.312
Now let's add
the rear window defogger.

05:16.536 --> 05:18.251
Twister!
Get down!

05:25.038 --> 05:26.992
"Air Skinner" brings it up.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.070
He bounces the ball repeatedly
in a dribbling type motion.

05:35.216 --> 05:35.970
Foul!

05:35.978 --> 05:38.861
Great, I fouled out.
Now can I go?

05:38.867 --> 05:40.963
Nope, I grant you
five more fouls.

05:56.866 --> 05:58.751
Top this, Donny.

06:03.727 --> 06:05.031
Thank you, children.

06:05.036 --> 06:08.203
Welcome to the unveiling of our
new school lunch purchasing plan,

06:08.208 --> 06:10.581
known as the Flex Plan.

06:15.097 --> 06:17.081
Students may spend
up to ten points per day

06:17.098 --> 06:18.953
in up to four
of seven categories.

06:18.956 --> 06:21.763
Unused points roll over week
to week but not month to month.

06:21.766 --> 06:24.833
Categories not included :
meat, dairy, vegetables...

06:24.836 --> 06:25.612
Wha...?

06:26.085 --> 06:26.882
That's odd.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.311
But, as a one-time occurrence,
no cause for alarm.

06:33.838 --> 06:36.573
It's not funny;
these movements are involuntary.

06:40.568 --> 06:44.343
This almost makes me want
to find out how magnets work.

07:20.968 --> 07:24.051
Bart! Bart! Bart!
Bart! Bart! Bart!

07:24.065 --> 07:27.021
Bart! Bart! Bart!
Bart! Bart! Bart!

07:29.517 --> 07:30.722
Who did this?

07:30.728 --> 07:33.912
Until I find out, no one is leaving
this mixed-use auditorium.

07:33.917 --> 07:37.472
But some of us
have after-school care!

07:37.705 --> 07:40.792
When I catch
the culprit and I will...

07:40.797 --> 07:43.111
I'm gonna throw this away...

07:43.117 --> 07:44.931
and use this instead!

07:48.808 --> 07:50.311
Principal Skinner?

07:51.128 --> 07:52.282
I did it.

07:54.128 --> 07:57.063
Young man, my office, now!

07:58.496 --> 07:59.772
Huh?

07:59.977 --> 08:01.882
Why did you take
the rap for me?

08:01.887 --> 08:03.701
I don't know.
I like your style.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.112
Well, remember this:

08:05.115 --> 08:07.712
Bart Simpson takes care
of his friends.

08:08.167 --> 08:09.700
Come see me when you get out.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.662
Young man, brace yourself...

08:15.727 --> 08:17.721
for some congratulations!

08:17.737 --> 08:19.232
We did it!
You're in!

08:19.236 --> 08:21.482
We finally have a man
on the inside.

08:21.498 --> 08:26.252
We're gonna put Bart Simpson
away for a long, long time.

08:26.258 --> 08:29.223
By law, the most we can give
him is a ten-day suspension.

08:29.226 --> 08:31.380
Well, that's long to a kid!

08:33.607 --> 08:35.700
All our other attempts
to get a spy inside

08:35.707 --> 08:37.543
the Bart Simpson operation
have failed.

08:37.546 --> 08:40.159
Uter, Ralph, Doug the
hip guidance counselor...

08:40.167 --> 08:42.361
he was never the same after Bart
got through with him.

08:42.378 --> 08:44.672
Your extracurriculars
are gonna need a lot

08:44.678 --> 08:47.411
of work if you want
to get into Vanderbilt.

08:47.906 --> 08:50.161
I'll get the goods
on this Simpson kid.

08:50.165 --> 08:51.883
You have my word
as a snitch.

08:51.885 --> 08:54.523
Oh. Here he comes.
Now this won't be easy,

08:54.536 --> 08:55.793
but pretend I'm a jerk.

08:55.797 --> 08:59.851
Young man, I'm gonna be on you
like a numerator on a denominator!

09:00.897 --> 09:02.301
Let's take a ride.

09:02.407 --> 09:03.991
I got a place with a view.

09:07.226 --> 09:09.990
I've never seen
blue vines before.

09:09.993 --> 09:12.129
They're only sold in Europe.
I know a guy.

09:16.247 --> 09:16.979
Ah, yeah!

09:16.978 --> 09:18.675
You can really taste the blue.

09:18.689 --> 09:20.302
Check this out... Nyaa!

09:20.307 --> 09:21.900
Oh, that's so cool!

09:24.298 --> 09:26.823
Here's a little hair
of the dog for tomorrow.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.550
Oh, thanks, Bart.

09:28.558 --> 09:30.552
Now th we're buddies,
I can let you in on some of

09:30.556 --> 09:32.163
the cool scams
we run at school.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.571
Oh, yeah?
Like what?

09:33.758 --> 09:36.230
Bathroom passes,
doctor's notes...

09:36.238 --> 09:40.131
We can rig a cootie catcher so
you can marry anybody you want.

09:42.176 --> 09:44.753
Whoa! Sherri!
I'm in.

09:44.757 --> 09:48.403
Milhouse, bust out four
of our finest juice boxes.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.213
I just wanna say...

09:55.218 --> 09:57.583
juice-box fight!

10:00.478 --> 10:02.733
Sounds like fun.
Can I play?

10:02.735 --> 10:03.722
Sure.

10:06.578 --> 10:07.941
How is that fun?

10:07.947 --> 10:10.311
Fun's only fun
if everyone's having fun.

10:10.317 --> 10:11.511
Mom, what are you doing?

10:11.516 --> 10:13.183
Honey, this is how I save money

10:13.185 --> 10:14.431
on ketchup and mustard.

10:14.437 --> 10:15.882
Do you do it with relish?

10:15.888 --> 10:18.233
No, I'm kind of
embarrassed about it.

10:18.235 --> 10:20.140
Mrs. Simpson, may I take you

10:20.147 --> 10:21.573
for an evening drive?

10:21.575 --> 10:23.573
Our loaner awaits.

10:23.975 --> 10:27.101
Did you just unlock
the car from here?

10:35.886 --> 10:38.840
<i>Baby, let's cruise</i>

10:38.886 --> 10:44.122
<i>Away from here....</i>

10:47.117 --> 10:50.391
<i>Don't be confused, baby</i>

10:50.658 --> 10:56.220
<i>The way is clear</i>

10:57.718 --> 11:03.993
<i>And if you want it,
you got it forever</i>

11:04.086 --> 11:07.980
<i>This is not
a one-night stand, baby...</i>

11:09.605 --> 11:12.082
Hello. You've reached
the snug bug.

11:12.808 --> 11:14.540
What do you mean
my car's ready?!

11:14.547 --> 11:15.901
Well, you can keep it, 'cause

11:15.908 --> 11:17.252
I'm never giving up this one.

11:17.256 --> 11:18.793
Now why don't you enjoy

11:18.797 --> 11:20.181
the sounds of my wife

11:20.196 --> 11:23.061
and me making sweet,
sweet love.

11:26.726 --> 11:29.100
That wasn't us,
that was the transmission.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.971
Box fight!
Box fight!

11:49.976 --> 11:53.020
One whistle!
Two whistles!

11:53.028 --> 11:57.542
I'm one whistle away
from three whistles, people!

11:57.855 --> 11:59.451
Faculty lounge

12:04.426 --> 12:06.740
All right, here's the plan:
we go in there,

12:06.746 --> 12:08.821
fill the coffee pot with
crickets from this bag

12:08.828 --> 12:10.862
labeled crickets and leave.

12:21.136 --> 12:28.963
<i>I'm shipping up to Boston
Whoa-oh-oh</i>

12:28.968 --> 12:32.602
<i>Shipping up to Boston
Whoa-oh-oh</i>

12:32.608 --> 12:37.453
<i>I'm shipping off
to find my wooden leg</i>

12:43.436 --> 12:47.552
<i>I'm a sailor peg,
and I lost my leg</i>

12:47.556 --> 12:51.763
<i>Climbing up the topsails,
I lost my leg...</i>

13:06.577 --> 13:08.112
Skinner's five steps

13:08.117 --> 13:09.031
ahead of me.

13:09.037 --> 13:10.571
I put a tack in his chair,

13:10.575 --> 13:11.883
he's corked his pants!

13:11.887 --> 13:14.670
I throw a tomato,
he's making salad!

13:14.877 --> 13:18.732
I have some information
ye might be interested in.

13:18.736 --> 13:20.681
But it won't be easy to hear.

13:20.687 --> 13:21.963
Because of your stupid accent?

13:21.966 --> 13:23.580
Nach-nae!

13:23.608 --> 13:25.851
Because of its upsetting nature!

13:25.887 --> 13:29.112
Skinner's gotten to
someone close to ye.

13:29.118 --> 13:30.372
A rat.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.392
- Who is it?
- I dunno.

13:32.398 --> 13:33.641
But Skinner's goin' to

13:33.646 --> 13:34.941
meet the rat right now.

13:38.737 --> 13:40.033
Thanks, Willie.

13:40.548 --> 13:42.721
A child thanked me!

13:42.726 --> 13:44.880
I gotta write this
in my journal.

13:45.586 --> 13:46.851
Dear...

13:46.917 --> 13:48.340
diary,

13:48.358 --> 13:50.173
Today I've...

14:10.246 --> 14:11.180
Got him.

14:36.325 --> 14:37.823
Where am I?

14:37.875 --> 14:39.763
You're in line
for a measle shot.

14:40.728 --> 14:41.943
Okay, now we've made a

14:41.946 --> 14:43.661
guide hole for the real needle.

14:45.918 --> 14:48.052
Uh, Bart,
where are we going?

14:51.775 --> 14:52.922
Gentlemen,

14:52.927 --> 14:55.283
someone I thought I could trust

14:55.297 --> 14:56.541
is a rat.

14:57.546 --> 14:58.833
Now, let's see.

14:58.835 --> 15:00.561
Is it my
best friend,

15:00.598 --> 15:02.230
my other best friend,

15:02.235 --> 15:04.370
or a kid I just met?

15:04.775 --> 15:06.181
Donny...

15:06.188 --> 15:07.843
grab Milhouse's legs.

15:07.846 --> 15:08.860
He's the rat.

15:10.128 --> 15:12.552
You grew tired
of always being in my shadow.

15:12.555 --> 15:16.640
No, I like your shadow.
It's nice and cool.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.300
Quit it! No!

15:21.926 --> 15:24.780
Don't worry, we'll get him out
in a couple hours.

15:32.405 --> 15:33.390
Oh, my Gosh.

15:33.408 --> 15:36.330
It's an outhouse
sent from the future.

15:36.526 --> 15:38.693
Hey, I'm in here.

15:38.695 --> 15:41.211
Be quiet, Robo-potty.

15:41.215 --> 15:42.970
Okay.

15:44.525 --> 15:45.961
Now that we have taken care

15:45.967 --> 15:46.982
of our rat problem,

15:46.985 --> 15:48.282
Skinner can't stop us,

15:48.285 --> 15:50.590
and I've got a prank I've
been planning for months.

15:50.598 --> 15:52.593
We're going to egg Skinner's house.

15:52.598 --> 15:54.180
We've already egged his car,

15:54.185 --> 15:56.110
his office, and his father's grave.

15:56.115 --> 15:57.511
How's this going to be different?

15:57.517 --> 16:00.560
Gentlemen,
this is an ostrich egg.

16:01.846 --> 16:03.452
Normally,
you can't even buy these.

16:03.466 --> 16:05.302
You have to buy
the ostrich and wait.

16:05.316 --> 16:06.752
How much of this is gunk?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.491
The whole insides.

16:09.498 --> 16:12.800
Whoa, to think this came out
of some animal's butt.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.762
Beautiful, in its way.

16:15.238 --> 16:17.031
This car is amazing.

16:17.036 --> 16:19.452
The radio lets me contribute

16:19.455 --> 16:20.830
directly to NPR.

16:21.116 --> 16:24.970
This is Terry Gross from NPR,
saying "Thank you. "

16:24.978 --> 16:27.570
Now, let's get back
to our 1987 interview

16:27.576 --> 16:29.181
with Senator Alan Cranston.

16:29.187 --> 16:31.002
I never dreamed an American car

16:31.008 --> 16:32.173
designed in Germany,

16:32.216 --> 16:34.340
assembled in Mexico
from parts made in Canada

16:34.347 --> 16:36.232
could be so amazing.

16:37.225 --> 16:39.511
Yeah, I can't believe
all those years

16:39.518 --> 16:41.722
I used to drive
that old piece of...

16:41.738 --> 16:42.590
What the...?

16:44.166 --> 16:45.771
My old car.

16:45.776 --> 16:47.650
So you're sure
this baby'll make

16:47.657 --> 16:48.882
it out to the desert?

16:49.438 --> 16:51.682
Sure. Why, what'd you
have in mind?

16:51.688 --> 16:54.742
Well, we gonna start by shooting
her full of holes, and, uh,

16:54.746 --> 16:56.420
then me and the boys are gonna

16:56.428 --> 16:57.920
have a little fun with her.

16:59.255 --> 17:01.232
I'll have you know I love this car

17:01.245 --> 17:02.813
as if it were my own child.

17:05.928 --> 17:07.242
Dad?

17:07.997 --> 17:09.691
Sorry, Maggie.

17:13.395 --> 17:15.800
Say, Simpson, would you mind holding

17:15.808 --> 17:17.311
one end of this banner

17:17.318 --> 17:18.550
while I put it up?

17:18.557 --> 17:21.162
My pleasure, sir.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.621
We'll see who's laughing
when your house

17:27.627 --> 17:30.332
is smeared with ostrich albumen.

17:39.155 --> 17:41.260
Donny's the rat.

17:41.265 --> 17:42.962
Where do you think you're going?

17:42.965 --> 17:45.123
Ah, get back to your
knitting, Seymour.

17:45.148 --> 17:48.052
I will, but it's because I want to.

17:52.565 --> 17:55.232
So, guys,
before we hit Skinner's,

17:55.246 --> 17:57.160
I want to make a quick stop.

18:05.456 --> 18:06.711
Hey, Bart,

18:07.206 --> 18:09.123
uh, what are we doing here?

18:09.125 --> 18:10.673
There's been a change of plans.

18:10.676 --> 18:13.313
I was going to tell you,
but then I remembered...

18:13.328 --> 18:14.682
you're the rat!

18:14.685 --> 18:16.820
No, no, no,
you got it all wrong.

18:16.826 --> 18:18.873
Skinner's tongue was blue.

18:18.878 --> 18:21.613
Blue from the vines you gave him.

18:21.638 --> 18:23.481
Why'd you do it, man?

18:23.486 --> 18:25.723
Look, you don't start
out wanting to be a rat.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.841
Sometimes it's your only option.

18:28.356 --> 18:30.262
Skinner and Chalmers wanted to get

18:30.265 --> 18:32.060
someone inside your organization

18:32.065 --> 18:33.733
someone with no history.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.403
Too cute, too tall,

18:35.408 --> 18:37.442
too Siamese, too Siamese.

18:37.447 --> 18:38.622
How much for that one?

18:40.798 --> 18:42.203
I'm sorry, Bart.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.951
You were like a
brother to me.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.201
We were going to take wood

18:45.205 --> 18:46.780
shop together and make nunchucks.

18:46.788 --> 18:48.641
And then take people to our lockers

18:48.647 --> 18:50.131
and show them our nunchucks.

18:50.136 --> 18:51.301
I know.

18:51.437 --> 18:53.090
That would have been cool.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.633
Are we going to fizz
this guy or what?

18:55.635 --> 18:56.521
Fizz me?

18:56.528 --> 18:58.562
A funny thing happens when

18:58.565 --> 19:00.830
you mix Mentos with Diet Coke.

19:03.845 --> 19:07.383
Now imagine that times a million.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.121
And it's all going to go down

19:14.128 --> 19:15.502
in Skinner's office.

19:15.508 --> 19:18.330
That's all we needed to hear.

19:19.037 --> 19:21.472
Running away rules!

19:21.508 --> 19:25.470
Sorry to plop, plop on your fizz, fizz.

19:25.475 --> 19:27.342
What are you doing here?

19:27.627 --> 19:30.333
I knew egging my house
was just a ploy.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.892
You see, the rat who told
you about my rat

19:32.895 --> 19:34.431
was also a rat.

19:34.437 --> 19:37.322
It was rats within rats...

19:37.325 --> 19:39.111
which was also me dinner last night.

19:39.115 --> 19:41.570
Willie?!
You're on Skinner's side?!

19:41.575 --> 19:42.922
He gave me something

19:42.928 --> 19:44.130
you never could...

19:44.135 --> 19:47.092
an elementary school diploma.

19:49.056 --> 19:51.441
Bart, we're going to send
you to the toughest

19:51.445 --> 19:53.823
juvenile detention center there is.

19:53.835 --> 19:55.911
And it's all thanks to Donny here,

19:55.916 --> 19:57.631
who can happily live the rest of his life

19:57.637 --> 19:59.342
knowing he betrayed the one boy

19:59.345 --> 20:00.933
who actually cared about him.

20:22.018 --> 20:24.520
Skinner!

20:24.666 --> 20:26.830
- Skinner?
- I'm all right, sir.

20:26.837 --> 20:29.183
Don't ever scare me
like that again.

20:29.198 --> 20:31.891
Well, I guess we're even.

20:31.956 --> 20:33.480
What are you going to do now?

20:33.486 --> 20:35.931
What I always do...
survive.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.613
Hey, we should get
together sometime.

20:38.615 --> 20:41.221
You know, to make nunchucks.

20:41.227 --> 20:42.523
Sweet.

20:45.036 --> 20:48.013
The rat symbolizes obviousness.
