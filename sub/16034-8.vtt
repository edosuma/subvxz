WEBVTT

00:47.120 --> 00:48.781
(Dog barks)

00:51.920 --> 00:53.706
(Men chatting)

01:11.040 --> 01:12.428
What did he bring?

01:13.680 --> 01:16.820
A proposal...from Trencrom.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.461
Judas, Ross! Will you never learn?

01:19.640 --> 01:20.948
Possibly not.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.941
You are about to stand trial
for being part ofthe smuggling run.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.906
I can't bear it all over again.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.868
So you can tell Trencrom,
till he offers to stand in court in your place,

01:30.040 --> 01:33.464
he can sling his proposals,
and his guineas,

01:33.640 --> 01:36.029
and his secret caches
off Damsel Point!

01:46.480 --> 01:48.789
My money's on transportation.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.623
It's not essential. Elizabeth's already
unnerved by his involvement.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.382
Any form of discredit in court today will suffice.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.824
Hm... I admire your confidence.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.343
When one has laid the foundations,
one has every right to expect a result.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.019
(Bustle of market)

02:33.040 --> 02:35.019
CLERK: Call Ross Poldark.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.669
Well, well.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.422
Here we are again.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.309
There are those who seem capable
of learning from their mistakes,

02:49.480 --> 02:51.345
and those who do not.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.182
Clearly you fall into the latter category.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.339
Mr Poldark?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.908
With the deepest respect, sir,
I beg to differ.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.660
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds that on the night in question,

03:07.840 --> 03:11.139
I was not at Nampara Cove,
but at St Ives.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.460
I can produce three witnesses
to swear to the fact.

03:23.960 --> 03:28.067
Customs officer Vercoe alleges
you were part ofthe smuggling operation,

03:28.240 --> 03:30.549
that you attacked him and broke his nose.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.549
I'm very sorry to hear
about Mr Vercoe's injuries, sir,

03:33.720 --> 03:37.986
but as my witnesses will testify,
the assailant could not possibly have been I.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.707
Aye, sir. It's true, sir.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.619
- Case dismissed.
- (Court murmurs)

03:58.760 --> 04:00.546
Call Dwight Enys.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.227
I have perused your statement
and I find it singularly unconvincing.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.858
No educated man can suddenly
appear on a cliff edge

04:14.040 --> 04:17.669
and start building a bonfire
without certain conclusions being drawn.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.467
What explanation can you offer?

04:19.640 --> 04:22.541
- It was a cold night and my coat was thin.
- (Ripples of laughter)

04:22.720 --> 04:25.587
Heaw responsibility rests upon
all men of reputation

04:25.760 --> 04:29.218
to help stamp out the illegal conduct
oftheir less enlightened neighbours,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.743
not to encourage or participate in it.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.224
- What have you to say?
- Nothing that would convince you, sir.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.020
Fined 50 or three months' imprisonment.

04:52.160 --> 04:55.539
(Hushed) Sir.
Mr Trencrom offers to pay your fine, sir.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.941
Tell Mr Trencrom I thank him, but
I'm perfectly capable of paying my own fine.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.859
You should take his bounty, Dwight.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.379
- He looks afer his friends.
- Mr Trencrom is not my friend.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.461
- I did not go to all that trouble for his sake.
- No. For mine.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.029
- You know what I feel about that.
- You told me many times.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.259
- I am under an enduring debt.
- No.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.668
Endunng.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.308
So now it's all over,
when do you leave for Bath?

05:21.480 --> 05:25.462
- I've no plans to do so.
- Your... Your wedding to Caroline.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.939
Is off. We were incompatible.
I see that now.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.829
It could never have lasted and...
it would have led to misery on both sides.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.741
What made you decide
to accept Trencrom's offer?

05:49.920 --> 05:52.900
When a man's life is in tatters,
he can ill afford to be stubborn.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.544
I never thought I'd see the day.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.426
That I'd go to jail?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.545
That you'd play the penitent to avoid it.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.507
I played the game!
I thought that's what you wanted.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.701
Is there really no hope for Grace?

06:08.360 --> 06:10.305
On Saturday our coal runs out.

06:11.040 --> 06:15.022
The engine will halt and so will
this whole dismal venture.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.341
I'm sorry for it.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.499
I'm sorry for many things.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.102
Our workers, our coffers...

06:25.840 --> 06:28.468
- And most of all, I'm sorry for you.
- Nay, Ross.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.589
For selling my shares in a profitable mine
and sinking them into this utter folly.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.341
All I can say is this,

06:35.520 --> 06:39.468
- I'll never again be guilty of such recklessness.
- (Door opens)

06:41.560 --> 06:43.425
Captain Henshawe to see you, sir.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.861
Captain Ross. Ma'am.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.259
Excuse the intrusion,
but I'd like for you to see something.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.906
What's that? The last of our coal?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.786
- Ha!_ Tin.
-Tm?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.069
From that shaft we're sinking
below the 60 fathoms.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.140
They come upon it today.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.908
Have you been down?
Is there any size to it?

07:05.080 --> 07:08.425
Six foot and more across
and we don't yet know how deep.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.228
We've spent 18 months searching for copper

07:11.400 --> 07:13.789
and you expect me to get excited
over a parcel oftin!

07:16.200 --> 07:17.508
Who found it?

07:17.680 --> 07:19.784
- Ted Carkeek and Paul Daniel.
- Hm...

07:19.960 --> 07:22.099
And they think they've discovered
El Dorado!

07:23.160 --> 07:25.469
I'd like for you to come
and see it for yourself.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.146
Trevithick reckons his engine
should last 50 years.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.867
No doubt he's right.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.019
Well, given the opportunity.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.741
- 'Tis worth a look, Captain.
- You'll not be disappointed.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.380
Will you be joining us below, ma'am?

07:47.560 --> 07:51.985
No, I think not, but do take my assistant,
and make sure he reports back to me.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.179
(Demelza hums a tune)

08:15.880 --> 08:17.745
- Betty!
- Ah. It's true?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.899
A keenly lode found and the mine's saved?

08:20.080 --> 08:22.662
I wish as much as you.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.058
I'll save my wishes for an easy birthing!

08:25.240 --> 08:26.787
That is wishful thinking!

08:27.720 --> 08:29.142
Hello!

08:29.320 --> 08:30.582
Good day to you, ladies.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.863
Don't 'ee fear, Betty.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.667
If anyone can make it right, 'tis Dr Enys.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.979
Oh, what it is to be a miracle worker!

08:38.840 --> 08:40.819
(Men's indistinct voices)

08:48.080 --> 08:50.059
I agree...

08:50.240 --> 08:51.867
It's not unimpressive.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.224
You said all along
you'd a feeling to go deeper.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.539
Yes, but for copper, not for tin.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.069
Anyway, it mayjust be the merest pocket.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.865
Bring up what you can.
It'll make a difference to your final earnings.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.429
We'd have given up more easily
without this find.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.022
I know that, Paul.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.824
But it's come too late to save us.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.861
'Tis a queer one, though.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.020
- Copper under tin you'd expect.
- But not tin under copper.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.909
To my mind what's needed is breathing space,
to see ifthis'll amount to anything.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.538
- I'd agree.
- How's that to happen?

09:29.720 --> 09:31.904
I tell you, I don't have 20 in the world.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.901
Betty seems fair.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.707
I wish she were stronger.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.825
But then all these people are half-starved.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.228
She's braver than she looks.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.708
She wants me at the birthing.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.508
Though in truth, she's as well offwith you
and Mrs Zacky.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.581
It'd make her easier to know
she'll be tended by a man of learning.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.546
With little practical experience.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.860
It's not so. Look what you did for Rosina.
Was that not practical?

09:55.040 --> 09:56.189
It was indeed.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.544
Has your knee given you trouble
since the ambush?

09:58.720 --> 10:00.824
No, sir. And I'm that grateful.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.949
What would have happened
if 'ee hadn't come to help me?

10:04.120 --> 10:05.542
Well, you'd be wed to Charlie!

10:05.720 --> 10:09.542
Never knowed he was the informer.
'Tis better this way.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.980
Is it?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.507
If you hadn't helped Rosina...

10:19.680 --> 10:23.582
I'd be married, in a new town,
tending new patients, living a new life.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.865
Rosina's knee do have much to answer for!

10:27.040 --> 10:29.099
It has saved me from myself, at any rate.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.266
(Gulls cry)

10:47.280 --> 10:49.305
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.349
Dear Dwight. I am returning your letters
which I have fully digested

11:14.520 --> 11:18.308
and in which I fond nothing
to make me regret my decision.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.659
Your preference for your patients
and friends is esteemable.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.944
Had it not been at my expense,

11:25.120 --> 11:28.260
I would not now be requesting you
to never write to me again.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.703
But it was. So I do.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.545
Demelza?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.865
I've been meaning to call upon you,

12:09.040 --> 12:11.508
to thank you for your kindness
these past few months.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.227
In lending you my husband?

12:14.600 --> 12:15.703
In a manner of speaking.

12:15.880 --> 12:19.145
Oh, you're welcome to him. Just so long as
you remember where he belong

12:19.320 --> 12:21.902
and send him back to me
when you're done with him.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.589
Mistress Poldark!

12:25.760 --> 12:29.105
Another escape for your husband in court.
What a charmed life he leads.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.861
It would appear so.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.068
- For you, young man.
- George, you must stop this.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.344
Oh, cannot a man spoil his godson?

12:57.920 --> 13:01.663
This new find, what will it mean?

13:04.840 --> 13:06.421
In a word...

13:09.360 --> 13:10.622
..nothing.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.264
Perhaps ifwe'd struck a massive bed oftin,
requiring minimum outlay

13:16.440 --> 13:17.782
and promising a quick return...

13:17.960 --> 13:19.939
Tin do fetch less than copper?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.142
Considerably.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.220
And besides, what good would it do?

13:24.400 --> 13:26.664
The tin industry is much depressed.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.422
Pity.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.741
But there it is.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.628
Did I mention that I saw Horace Treneglos
at the market?

13:42.800 --> 13:45.462
No. Is he well?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.301
He sends his compliments...

13:49.200 --> 13:53.148
..and say that it's a shame that you've sold
all of your shares in Wheal Leisure.

13:54.200 --> 14:00.218
I said that he must be mistaken.
For surely if you had, you'd have told me.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.222
I've been meaning to mention this
for some time.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.139
But not quite sure how to begin.

14:15.280 --> 14:19.740
As you know, Francis sank his last 600
into Wheal Grace.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.228
Yes...

14:21.400 --> 14:24.824
And when he died, he left Elizabeth
with...considerable debts.

14:26.280 --> 14:30.023
To relieve her poverty,
I...bought all his shares at Wheal Grace

14:30.200 --> 14:32.907
through a third party,
knowing she would not accept the money.

14:33.080 --> 14:37.141
- But why should you...
- Because I felt under a burden of obligation,

14:38.560 --> 14:40.539
to Francis and his family...

14:42.920 --> 14:44.467
..which is now discharged.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.740
Of course, at the time we had Trencrom's
money coming in, but since the ambush...

14:58.680 --> 15:00.147
Are you angry?

15:01.920 --> 15:03.945
- That you help Elizabeth?
- And Geoffrey Charles.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.906
And leave Jeremy and me
to fend for ourselves?

15:06.080 --> 15:08.264
You have me to fend for you.
They have no one.

15:08.440 --> 15:13.343
Are you sure? From what I hear,
George is being very obliging.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.499
Hm... Doubtless he would be...

15:16.680 --> 15:18.307
..if Elizabeth would let him.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.027
But she will not.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.180
George's ambition before Francis died

15:26.360 --> 15:28.908
was to drive a wedge between our two families.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.467
And the easiest way to do it
was by befriending theirs.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.939
By helping Elizabeth,
he is merely continuing the same tactics.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.748
- Yes, Ross.
- Although it wasn't my aim in helping her,

15:39.920 --> 15:44.027
it does have the effect of strengthening
her hand against him.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.301
Yes, Ross.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.267
- Mistress Demelza?
- Who be that, then...

16:06.920 --> 16:08.262
..coming across the fields?

16:08.440 --> 16:10.749
Betty Carkeek! 'Tis 'er time!

16:10.920 --> 16:13.388
And Dr Enys can't be found!

16:14.000 --> 16:16.264
Ross! Fetch me the brandywine!

16:17.920 --> 16:19.945
Calm yourself. We'll go, we'll go.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.701
Now you stay here, Jeremy.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.868
Thank you.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.229
Come here. Come here. Whoa!

16:28.400 --> 16:30.664
- Hur
— rY!
Sir!

16:30.840 --> 16:33.263
Captain, er...who is it?

16:33.440 --> 16:36.420
..er...Henshawe, asking for you.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.147
Your mine, whatever.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.220
Here. Take him.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.987
Won't be long.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.338
(Pained cry of labour)

16:55.480 --> 16:57.698
Betty, I've brought you something for the pain.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.019
I found him, Betty! Dr Enys be here.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.063
(Wails)

17:13.680 --> 17:16.228
We've opened her up a tidy bit
these past days.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.380
The last we brought up,
'tis as rich as I'd ever seen.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.300
Ross?

17:24.880 --> 17:27.781
More and more it go against the grain
to let her fill up with water,

17:27.960 --> 17:29.507
knowing what's down there.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.545
It goes against the grain at any time!

17:32.360 --> 17:35.625
- But without coal to keep the pump working...
- That's what I'm thinking.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.542
I could put down 100.
It would see us through another month.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.579
You'd be willing to do that?
After all our failures?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.739
In a day or so, we'll know better.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.627
If nothing comes of it, we can close
and I'll have lost 20.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.939
With your permission,
I'll send out for more coal.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.224
By all means, send out!

17:53.400 --> 17:55.379
(Chuckles)

17:57.760 --> 18:01.105
- (Pained cry of labour)
- It'll be a boy, that's for sure.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.066
They's trouble even before they're born.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.946
Push. Push, Betty. Push.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.304
(She wails)

18:09.200 --> 18:11.259
(Baby cries)

18:12.320 --> 18:14.299
Ssh. Ssh.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.027
Betty, 'ee'll never guess!
There's news of Grace!

18:24.200 --> 18:26.179
And a fine new Carkeek boy!

18:27.280 --> 18:29.020
What news of Grace?

18:29.200 --> 18:33.182
- She's to stay open another month.
- 'Tis a present we never looked for!

18:33.360 --> 18:37.148
God willing the lode should hold
and I'll be able to feed my family!

18:38.880 --> 18:41.348
- To young Master Carkeek!
- And tin!

18:41.520 --> 18:42.942
And tin!

18:58.720 --> 19:00.585
God bless 'ee, sur.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.661
Bless Captain Henshawe.
He's our saviour.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.339
(Door opens)

19:14.000 --> 19:15.786
This is becoming an obsession.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.099
Are you planning on joining the Army?

19:18.280 --> 19:21.465
Why would I do that when I have battlefronts
of my own at home?

19:21.640 --> 19:23.028
Hm...

19:23.680 --> 19:26.501
Which reminds me.
Have those forces been deployed yet?

19:26.680 --> 19:29.308
Hm. As per your instructions.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.664
Don't frown, dear.
A wrinkled brow is not becoming.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.820
I'm at my wits' end with Tabb.
He contradicts everything I say

19:45.000 --> 19:46.786
as if he thinks he is master here now!

19:46.960 --> 19:51.385
And now these letters have come, all these
questions, which apparently only I can answer.

19:52.240 --> 19:56.381
A tithe of1 and 6 shillings on the seines
of certain fishing boats in Sawle.

19:56.560 --> 20:00.940
"Should the fishermen be pressed for money?"
I don't know! Should they?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.462
Can I afford not to press them?

20:02.640 --> 20:04.619
Whose need is greater?

20:06.480 --> 20:09.381
- Dear God, is there no end to it?
- What is it?

20:13.840 --> 20:15.023
Who are these people?

20:15.200 --> 20:20.024
Tinners, exercising their rights
under stannary law to prospect for tin.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.508
But this is outrageous!

20:21.680 --> 20:26.504
Vulgars permitted by law
to violate the purlieu of a gentleman's estate?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.905
How can such a thing be lawful?

20:30.080 --> 20:32.105
(Starts coughing) It's monstrous!

20:32.280 --> 20:35.465
(Splutters) Monstrous!

20:36.160 --> 20:38.628
(Coughs and gasps)

20:40.800 --> 20:42.586
No sign of it petering out?

20:42.760 --> 20:44.227
Far from it.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.265
You know I'm not one to raise hopes,

20:46.440 --> 20:48.419
but it could be significant.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.899
(Tapping and hammering)

20:58.280 --> 21:00.384
The damage is considerable.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.949
She'll need constant care
for the foreseeable future,

21:03.120 --> 21:04.906
possibly the rest of her life.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.588
But...we cannot afford a nurse.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.219
Who is to provide...

21:14.800 --> 21:16.108
Me.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.742
I must be the one to take care of her.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.185
Who's to take care of me?
I was here first!

21:22.360 --> 21:24.180
I must speak to Ross.

21:24.360 --> 21:28.865
You'll get no sympathy from that quarter!
He was never a fan ofyour mother!

21:29.600 --> 21:31.306
Is there no one else you can turn to?

22:25.200 --> 22:27.145
I came as soon as I could.
How IS she?

22:27.840 --> 22:32.061
Very bad. Dr Enys fears
she may never recover.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.025
You must know how that grieves me.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.418
I know how fond you are of her.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.902
- Do you know what I wish?
- No.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.945
That you allow me
to make the arrangements,

22:45.120 --> 22:47.827
engage a separate establishment for her
here at Trenwith

22:48.000 --> 22:50.946
- so no further burden need fall on you.
- I couldn't let you do that.

22:51.120 --> 22:55.102
You're so frail. You try to be strong,
but now it is you who need care.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.101
- Let me provide it.
- You're very kind, George.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.941
But I'm stronger than I look.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.781
I will have to be.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.702
- One must take what life sends.
- But not what I send?

23:04.880 --> 23:08.429
- You've already given so much.
- For my godson, a few trifles.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.261
For yourself, nothing.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.021
At least let me help your dear mother.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.462
(Elizabeth sighs)

23:13.640 --> 23:16.620
Your generosity makes me ashamed
to refuse you anything.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.907
Well, ifthere was one thing
you did not...refuse me,

23:22.680 --> 23:24.341
it would solve everything.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.461
What's that?

23:28.760 --> 23:30.227
Yourself.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.265
Before you speak, let me add one thing.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.939
You must be aware how long I've loved you,

23:36.120 --> 23:39.066
serving you only as I could,
paying back Francis's card debts,

23:39.240 --> 23:42.266
allowing no thought of retaliation
when he persistently insulted me.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.658
Since his death, I've served you
any way you allowed,

23:44.840 --> 23:48.105
and will continue to do so,
whether or not I stand to gain by it.

23:48.280 --> 23:51.829
- I'm more than grateful...
- But now I ask you to marry me.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.426
I say that I love you.

23:54.600 --> 23:59.378
I don't flatter myselfthat you love me.
I think you might like and respect me.

23:59.560 --> 24:02.108
I hope in time that liking might become
something more.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.986
- But...
- I cannot bring you breeding,

24:04.160 --> 24:06.344
but I can bring a kind of gentility

24:06.520 --> 24:10.707
which is all the more punctilious
for being only a generation deep.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.619
- As for material considerations...
- Please!

24:13.800 --> 24:17.099
You would never marry for money. If you did,
you would not be who I know you to be.

24:17.280 --> 24:21.387
But at the risk of offending,
let me be clear about what I can offer.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.663
My house is four times the size of Trenwith.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.628
I have 20 servants, a park of 500 acres,
my own carriage, a phaeton.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.701
You could have one too.
Or three or four.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.381
I'd take you to London or Bath.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.347
You'd wear the finest clothes,
the rarestjewels,

24:37.520 --> 24:39.147
mix with the best in society.

24:39.320 --> 24:43.108
As my adopted son,
Geoffrey Charles would be my heir.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.579
For so long you have lived in a cage.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.945
Will you not allow me to give you the key?

24:55.200 --> 24:57.179
Oh, George...

24:58.600 --> 25:00.340
I don't know what to say.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.779
Say nothing, my dear.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.506
I don't ask for an answer now.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.466
I only ask permission to give.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.467
It's just...that I feel so alone.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.029
Loneliness is not one-sided, Elizabeth.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.185
A man may feel it too.

25:23.560 --> 25:27.906
Especially when he has loved as long
and as devotedly as I have.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.858
And the devil taketh him up into
an exceedingly high mountain

26:01.040 --> 26:04.100
and showeth him all the kingdoms ofthe world,

26:04.280 --> 26:08.626
and sayeth, "All these things I will give thee."

26:08.800 --> 26:13.749
Yes, Aunt. All these things and more besides.

26:14.720 --> 26:19.464
A fortune for my boy
to make up for the one his father lost.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.743
And what is he expecting in return?
A heart?

26:26.640 --> 26:28.505
Is he aware that you have none to give,

26:28.680 --> 26:31.945
having long ago bestowed it elsewhere?

26:47.840 --> 26:50.422
- How soon _till we need timbers?
- Timbers cost.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.148
- But without them?
- You know as well as I do.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.981
Is it a risk we're willing to take?

26:55.160 --> 26:57.469
It's a risk we've been taking for some time now.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.943
We'd sooner 'ee spend money on coal,
to keep the pump going.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.782
There isn't a mine in existence
wouldn't take the same chance.

27:12.960 --> 27:16.179
- That's a pretty piece.
- I made it from an old one of Ross's.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.942
I shall wear it tonight.
We're expecting visitors.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.021
- Do I know 'em?
- One of 'em you even like.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.781
Huh...

27:52.960 --> 27:54.427
You grew up here?

27:54.600 --> 27:58.309
'Tis a veritable galleon
compared to my father's humble sloop.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.701
Aye aye, Captain.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.540
- Or should I say Admiral?
- My father.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.745
Charles William Poldark.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.424
Then he is my grandfather by prow,
since you are my commanding officer,

28:09.600 --> 28:11.227
- Stepmama!
- (They giggle)

28:11.400 --> 28:13.823
Elizabeth, my dear, how are you?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.458
May I introduce my stepson?
Midshipman James Blamey.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.380
My sister-in-law Elizabeth Poldark.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.948
Your servant, ma'am.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.782
Close the hatch, clear.
We don't want to be catching flies.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.587
- Well, Elizabeth...
- Well, cousin, how good of you to come.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.580
AGATHA: Is that little Verity?

28:31.760 --> 28:33.864
Bring her to me this minute!

28:34.040 --> 28:37.066
Cutlass at the ready? (Giggles)

28:39.960 --> 28:43.339
Had I known of your mother's condition,
we'd not have dreamed of intruding.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.499
How difficult it must be for you.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.624
It was at first.
But now she has a nurse and a maid.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.267
Is that not expensive?

28:54.440 --> 28:58.422
How strange it must be for you here,
without Francis.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.267
No more than for you.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.301
I've had to grow used to it.
For Geoffrey Charles's sake.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.061
And can you?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.623
For my son, I must do whatever's necessary.

29:11.840 --> 29:15.947
And that, boy,
is how you put the Navy in its place!

29:16.840 --> 29:19.502
Your great-aunt is a fiend at French Ruff.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.899
- Obviously I let her win.
- Obviously.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.269
We're expected at Nampara.
You'll go with us.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.987
Oh... I...

29:28.160 --> 29:30.025
Yes, Elizabeth?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.981
I have a headache.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.821
Did Elizabeth not wish to join you?

29:40.000 --> 29:43.458
She's distressed over her _mother's illness.
She sends her apologies and love.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.904
Mistress Poldark's a thing of beauty,
do you not think?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.662
Were I five years older,
I'd throw myself at her feet.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.661
- She'd very likely trample you underfoot!
- (Chuckles)

29:51.840 --> 29:55.185
On our way over I noticed the engine chimney
ofthe mine still smoking.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.342
We continue to limp on, existing on
a shoestring, everything against us.

29:59.520 --> 30:03.741
Not entirely! Tin has been found.
We're not sure how far or deep it goes, but...

30:03.920 --> 30:06.138
The quality ofthe ore is promising, I admit it.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.539
I'm very glad for you.
A change in your fortune is long deserved.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.063
You keep a very fine ship, Captain.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.585
- Do you have your own cabin?
- Naturally. Would you care to inspect it, sir?

30:15.760 --> 30:17.546
So I should!

30:59.720 --> 31:01.506
Do you see much of Elizabeth?

31:02.600 --> 31:04.864
She don't seem inclined to visit us now.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.422
But she's happy enough to admit Ross, or was.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.465
Why do you ask?

31:10.640 --> 31:15.145
I don't know, there's something...
I cannot put my ﬁnger on it.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.219
She seems a little on edge,
as if innerly excited.

31:24.440 --> 31:27.261
..that she thinks her circumstances
are about to change.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.623
Oh...

31:30.800 --> 31:32.779
Do you know why that might be?

31:34.480 --> 31:36.300
Perhaps you should ask Ross.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.662
Sounds a little bitter.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.102
Do it?

31:40.280 --> 31:42.180
I only meant he sees more of her than I.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.059
I know he did love her.

31:50.840 --> 31:52.944
So when he goes to see her, I...

31:53.120 --> 31:56.465
I'd not be human ifI didn't wonder
what they say to each other

31:56.640 --> 31:59.222
or...ifthey still have feelings.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.106
Do you think they do?

32:01.280 --> 32:03.703
They were each other's first love.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.940
Such a love cannot easily be put aside.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.827
- But you have no reason to think...
- No reason, just...

32:10.760 --> 32:12.625
Ross would never mean to hurt me.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.101
But I think if it came to a choice
between me and Elizabeth,

32:17.280 --> 32:19.145
and with Elizabeth now free...

32:19.320 --> 32:21.220
You cannot believe that!

32:32.000 --> 32:33.945
Your ship is the Thunderer?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.020
The frigate Hunter now, under Admiral Gell.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.863
We're in Plymouth Sound at present,
but under sailing orders next week.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.304
I'm monstrous glad of it.
I'd not want the war to end

32:42.480 --> 32:44.744
before I've had the chance
to pepper the Frenchies!

32:44.920 --> 32:48.549
Oh, I'm sure there'll be plenty of opportunity
for glory before the war is out.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.187
(Door opens)

32:50.800 --> 32:52.700
Oh. Erm... My apologies.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.586
No, no. Come in. Join us.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.627
May I introduce midshipman James Blamey?

32:57.800 --> 32:59.700
My good friend, Dr Dwight Enys.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.144
- Your servant, sir.
- And yours, sir.

33:03.040 --> 33:06.703
If you ever tire of life ashore,
consider us poor souls in the fleet.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.622
We're in dire need of good surgeons.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.667
- Is that so?
- Honour and glory beckon.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.228
As well as blood and gore.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.981
Honour and glory I can do without.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.425
But a mission, somewhere useful,
to direct my energies.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.740
- We can surely provide that.
- And a good skirmish as a fine distraction.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.388
- The point is, to do something.
- I agree.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.459
Idleness allows us too much time to think.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.905
What a treasure is James.

33:35.080 --> 33:38.664
He's like the west wind,
all gusty and clean and kind.

33:38.840 --> 33:42.583
- And he adores you!
- And I him, as if he were my own son.

33:42.760 --> 33:44.307
Oh, Verity, I'm that glad.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.379
It'll make up for...

33:48.000 --> 33:50.946
For what?
My not having a child of my own?

33:51.720 --> 33:54.427
Oh, but that's the most wonderful thing.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.906
There is nothing to make up for!

33:58.160 --> 34:00.867
- Verity, when?
- About October!

34:01.040 --> 34:03.019
(Both laugh happily)

34:18.720 --> 34:20.028
(Demelza sighs)

34:22.520 --> 34:24.988
Is it Verity's news which keeps you awake?

34:26.400 --> 34:27.822
I think so.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.059
I can't imagine what else it could be.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.939
No, I don't suppose you can.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.704
I got the impression that she thinks
her circumstances are about to change.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.706
(Cockerel crows)

35:04.960 --> 35:08.384
Is it not dangerous, Captain,
riding when you're not recovered?

35:09.560 --> 35:11.187
You leave me no choice.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.180
I was hoping you'd visit me as I convalesce.

35:13.360 --> 35:16.989
Or else that I'd receive an invitation to visit you.

35:18.280 --> 35:22.262
- Well, last time you came without an invitation.
- That was in the course of duty.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.749
This is in the pursuit of pleasure.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.267
Well, as you can see, my husband is not here.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.226
Are you sure ofthat?

35:31.400 --> 35:33.504
On my previous visit,
you told me he was from home,

35:33.680 --> 35:36.626
yet we both know he was somewhere
about the house.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.387
- Do we?
-Indeed.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.708
I thought it probable,
ifI posted a watch long enough,

35:42.880 --> 35:44.461
we'd discover where he was hiding.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.426
And did you post such a watch?

35:46.600 --> 35:50.309
- Oh... (Laughs) I did not.
- Why?

35:52.080 --> 35:54.628
I have too great a regard for you, ma'am.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.059
In truth, my heart was not in it.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.265
I'm a soldier, not a spy.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.546
I hold nothing against Captain Poldark,

36:04.720 --> 36:06.779
except he married so charming a wife.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.379
So I trust you hold nothing against me
for what I did.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.189
Indeed.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.102
I'm obliged to you for what you did not do.

36:19.480 --> 36:23.143
So now I'm forced to venture out
for company and gossnp.

36:23.320 --> 36:27.142
So what can you tell me? What news of
your cousin-in-law, Mistress Elizabeth?

36:28.960 --> 36:31.224
I am sure I've heard nothing.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.308
I'd have thought you of all people would know.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.900
And what do you hear?

36:38.080 --> 36:42.460
Only that Sir Hugh Bodrugan,
who shares a tailor with a certain person,

36:42.640 --> 36:46.383
tells me that certain person
has just ordered his wedding clothes.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.739
Judas, who's that?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.979
Can you not guess?

36:56.960 --> 36:59.099
Why, George Warleggan!

36:59.880 --> 37:01.859
Had you no idea?

37:02.840 --> 37:06.105
No. Um... Well, that is a...

37:07.640 --> 37:09.949
Yes, I did somewhat suspicion.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.702
No doubt you'll be able to ask him yourself
at the ball.

37:12.880 --> 37:13.983
The ball?

37:15.720 --> 37:17.745
Sir Hugh is to hold a ball in a week's time.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.548
I hope you'll favour me with the ecossaise.

37:21.080 --> 37:23.184
Yes, of course.

37:23.360 --> 37:26.227
Well, thank you for calling, Captain McNeil.

37:26.400 --> 37:30.541
I must go and check on Jeremy.
Pray excuse me.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.463
(Laughs excitedly)

37:43.080 --> 37:44.547
What ails 'ee, maid?

37:47.280 --> 37:49.180
George Warleggan is to marry Elizabeth.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.261
Mr Ross will be surprised.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.939
Mr Ross mustn't be told.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.543
He'll find out soon enough,
but it won't be from me.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.299
(Hammering and chipping)

38:17.920 --> 38:21.549
(Birds caw and waves crash in distance)

38:23.720 --> 38:26.382
DWIGHT:
Fresh air, and whatever fruit you can get.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.059
Phthisis and scurw.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.859
No wonder you've had your fill.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.861
I confess, a new challenge would suit me.

38:39.040 --> 38:42.305
A war would certainly supply that.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.661
You're not tempted yourself?

38:47.880 --> 38:49.859
If duty calls, I won't ignore it.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.589
But I know enough of combat
not to relish it.

38:53.760 --> 38:57.059
Whereas I can almost hear the cannons
as we speak.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.303
- Look here, Ted.
- See how far we can cut it back.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.146
(Crumbling)

39:04.320 --> 39:05.947
(Ominous rumbling)

39:12.560 --> 39:14.869
(Rumbling intensifies)

39:17.560 --> 39:20.142
- She's coming down!
- Run! Run!

39:23.240 --> 39:25.219
(Horse whinnies in distance)

39:26.240 --> 39:27.468
(Faint cries)

39:27.640 --> 39:30.302
Run, run! Go!

39:30.480 --> 39:32.459
(Distant rumbling)

39:35.760 --> 39:38.183
(Rocks falling, men shouting)

39:42.280 --> 39:45.864
(Distant shouts, horse whinnies)

39:51.320 --> 39:53.106
How many? How many?

39:53.280 --> 39:54.508
It's Paul and Ted!

39:54.680 --> 39:56.181
There's one here!

40:01.400 --> 40:02.469
Paul!

40:02.640 --> 40:04.141
(Groans)

40:34.400 --> 40:37.221
- Who's unaccounted for?
- Dan Curnow and Ted Carkeek.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.180
We don't stop until they're found.

40:53.720 --> 40:57.304
Forgive my intrusion. I thought to bring you
the news before you heard elsewhere.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.186
There's been an accident at Wheal Grace.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.102
- Your cousin-in-law...
- Is dead?

41:02.280 --> 41:04.305
Is very much alive.

41:05.160 --> 41:08.300
Only the poor souls who labour for him
have paid the price.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.186
What happened?

41:10.360 --> 41:12.544
What inevitably happens
when corners are cut

41:12.720 --> 41:15.063
and safety is abandoned in favour of profit.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.989
I can scarce believe it.
Ross, of all people?

41:19.160 --> 41:22.379
He's a desperate man.
One can only feel for his wife and child,

41:22.560 --> 41:28.829
innocent casualties of his overwhelming hubris
now condemned to a life of penury.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.585
But forgive me for keeping you
from your dear relations.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.269
The Devil!

42:31.880 --> 42:33.905
I hope you know what you're doing!

42:39.080 --> 42:41.184
(Clanking and grinding of machinery)

42:43.960 --> 42:45.939
Where's Ted?

42:53.720 --> 42:54.823
Dwight!

42:57.080 --> 42:58.786
How is he?

42:59.400 --> 43:02.904
He was buried too long.
I can't bring him back.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.179
There's nothing you can do here, Ross.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.779
Help the others.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.380
- One dead.
- Two.

43:23.280 --> 43:26.340
- And five more badly injured.
- I'm to blame.

43:26.520 --> 43:27.987
- Nay, Ross.
- Betty!

43:28.160 --> 43:30.469
- I should've ordered timbers.
- We all knew the risks.

43:30.640 --> 43:34.098
Grace is mine.
I should have insisted.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.905
Ted?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.059
20 fathoms of pumping gear have gone.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.985
Six weeks or more to clear the debris.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.789
200 won't even do it
even ifwe each had the capital.

43:59.960 --> 44:01.939
Even then I wouldn't attempt it.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.786
This mine has cost three lives!

44:07.400 --> 44:11.109
It was an ill-conceived venture from the start.
It Will never open again.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.100
(Betty sobs)

45:07.560 --> 45:08.982
My dear Ross.

45:09.160 --> 45:13.028
I do not know how to write this letter
or to tell you what I have to say...

45:23.360 --> 45:25.669
Are you ahead?

45:25.840 --> 45:27.865
I've already won.

45:29.320 --> 45:33.381
- I've secured the hand ofthe woman I love.
- Elizabeth Poldark.

45:33.560 --> 45:37.587
And in so doing, I deal the deadliest blow
to my bitterest enemy.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.429
I see I must congratulate you.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.579
Oh, I congratulate myself.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.427
It's not given to many to achieve...

45:47.600 --> 45:50.501
so much at a single stroke.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.020
Sometimes I don't know my own strength.

46:25.640 --> 46:26.948
What is it?

46:29.720 --> 46:31.699
Sir Hugh Bodrugan,

46:31.880 --> 46:33.666
inviting us to a ball.

46:34.440 --> 46:37.341
- Oh...
- Obviously we'll decline.

46:37.520 --> 46:39.499
Of course.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.859
Letter come from Trenwith.

46:45.960 --> 46:47.939
Thank you, Prudie.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.787
ELIZABETH: _ _
I know what I have to say Will distress you,

47:24.960 --> 47:28.339
and I, who gave you so much pain once before,

47:28.520 --> 47:32.741
would do almost anything than
to hurt you again and in the same way.

47:34.640 --> 47:36.949
Yet it seems I must.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.179
Oh, Ross, my life has been very frustrating,

47:40.360 --> 47:43.306
and since Fr ancis died,
a lonely and an empty one.

47:45.520 --> 47:48.102
Perhaps I am the wrong sort of person
to be left alone.

47:49.160 --> 47:52.789
I seem to need the strength and protection
only a man can give.

47:54.640 --> 47:57.382
I have agreed to marry George Warleggan.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.827
- I'm going to Trenwith.
- No, Ross!

48:15.000 --> 48:17.468
- I must speak with Elizabeth.
- Ross, you can't!

48:18.800 --> 48:20.267
Do you know what this is?

48:21.640 --> 48:23.028
Is it about George?

48:25.600 --> 48:28.023
- You knew?
- I heard rumours.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.782
- You didn't think to tell me?
- And have my head snapped off?

48:30.960 --> 48:33.702
This thing must be stopped!

48:33.880 --> 48:35.222
How? You can't stop it!

48:35.400 --> 48:37.664
- Perhaps you don't want me to stop it.
- Perhaps I don't.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.785
And especially not like this.

48:40.920 --> 48:43.866
- Like what?
- Whatever it is you intend.

48:44.040 --> 48:45.462
How do you know what I intend?

48:45.640 --> 48:48.029
How do I know anything, Ross?
How do I know you?

48:49.120 --> 48:51.224
And yet I think I do.

48:52.320 --> 48:56.381
- Please get out of my way.
- Ross, don't go there tonight.

48:56.560 --> 49:01.020
- Wait until tomorrow.
- Please...get out...of my way.

49:40.960 --> 50:07.140
Elizabeth!

50:18.520 --> 50:20.943
(Approaching footsteps)

50:27.800 --> 50:29.540
Ross!

50:29.720 --> 50:31.301
I came to pay my respects.

50:31.480 --> 50:33.789
And to thank you...for your letter.

50:33.960 --> 50:35.746
- Perhaps tomorrow morning...
- No.

50:36.760 --> 50:38.466
Not tomorrow. Now.

50:40.480 --> 50:42.345
Downstairs, then.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.499
I'll get a candle.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.866
- Ross, I don't think...
- ..I should be in here.

50:56.800 --> 50:58.700
There is no one to consider but you and I.

51:00.760 --> 51:01.829
Ross...

51:02.000 --> 51:03.865
I so hated having to send you that letter,

51:04.040 --> 51:06.463
but really, I've said all there is to be said.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.825
I disagree.
Perhaps you could clarify something for me.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.539
- George Warleggan...
- Yes?

51:13.720 --> 51:17.224
..a man I consider my greatest enemy.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.187
And you...

51:20.360 --> 51:22.499
I've long considered my greatest friend.

51:23.560 --> 51:26.586
In which particular am I most adrift?

51:26.760 --> 51:28.500
It's not as simple as that, Ross.

51:28.680 --> 51:32.309
Of course I'm proud and happy
to think of you as my greatest friend.

51:32.480 --> 51:33.947
Oh, well,

51:34.120 --> 51:35.781
it was more than that as I recall.

51:36.440 --> 51:40.024
Did you not tell me barely 12 months ago

51:40.200 --> 51:42.384
that you had made a mistake
in marrying Francis?

51:42.560 --> 51:46.781
That you realised quite soon
that it was I you had always loved?

51:46.960 --> 51:50.669
Do you think I would have said those words
had I known what would happen to Francis?

51:50.840 --> 51:52.546
And yet they cannot be unsaid.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.385
I felt you needed to know.

51:55.560 --> 51:57.824
That if you were unhappy in those early days,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.901
then so was I,
that the mistake was not yours, but mine.

52:01.080 --> 52:03.469
That mistake, as you call it,

52:04.520 --> 52:06.420
has cost many people dear -

52:06.600 --> 52:10.422
Francis, yourself, myself.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.387
What mistake are you making now?

52:14.520 --> 52:17.785
- I don't expect you to understand.
- Try me.

52:19.640 --> 52:22.825
George has been so good to me
since Francis died. So kind.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.343
Do you marry a man out of gratitude?

52:25.520 --> 52:27.465
No. Notjust that.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.858
You're wrong to think of him
as your greatest enemy.

52:30.040 --> 52:33.305
- The man who tried to get me hanged?
- I don't believe he intended that.

52:33.480 --> 52:36.779
And now I think I can help mend the breach
between you.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.624
Are you marrying him for his money?

52:40.120 --> 52:41.462
How dare you?

52:41.640 --> 52:44.586
God knows I've made mistakes in my life, Ross.

52:45.360 --> 52:47.863
But I've tried to be loyal
to the people I care for,

52:53.760 --> 52:55.148
What do you suggest for me?

52:55.320 --> 52:57.663
30 years ofwidowhood and loneliness?

52:58.320 --> 53:00.299
Can you offer me anything else?

53:01.480 --> 53:02.868
Do you?

53:06.200 --> 53:07.861
Do you love George?

53:09.040 --> 53:10.587
- Yes.
- Why do I not believe you?

53:10.760 --> 53:14.105
Why does this remind me ofwhen
you said you loved Francis?

53:14.280 --> 53:18.148
You asked me, would I condemn you
to 30 years ofwidowhood?

53:18.320 --> 53:19.947
Why would I need to?

53:20.120 --> 53:22.099
You could have your pick of 30 men!

53:22.280 --> 53:24.180
But I won't see you condemned to George!

53:24.360 --> 53:26.100
Please leave now, Ross.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.669
I'm my own mistress
and I will not be instructed.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.660
I'm sorry you feel like this but I cannot help it.

53:30.840 --> 53:36.221
Oh, you've never been able to help anything,
have you? It's all beyond your control,

53:36.400 --> 53:40.029
full of good intentions,
leaving a trail of havoc in your wake.

53:40.200 --> 53:41.906
Perhaps you can't help this either.

53:50.000 --> 53:54.869
I oppose this marriage, Elizabeth. I'd be glad of
your assurance you will not go through with it.

53:55.040 --> 53:56.940
We both know you don't love him!

53:57.120 --> 53:59.782
I love him to_ distraction
and Will marry him next month!

54:04.960 --> 54:06.188
Ross!

54:06.360 --> 54:08.669
You're hateful, horrible. I detest you!

54:08.840 --> 54:11.741
No, you don't.
You never have and you never will.

54:11.920 --> 54:13.945
You would not dare! You would not dare!

54:14.120 --> 54:17.146
I would, Elizabeth. I would.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.466
And so would you.

54:41.840 --> 54:43.740
(Jeremy cries)

54:56.880 --> 54:58.666
- T'ain't right.
- T'ain't fair.

54:58.840 --> 55:00.148
- T'int fit.
- T'int.

55:00.320 --> 55:03.062
(Infant cries)

55:56.920 --> 55:58.785
I must go before the household wakes.

56:00.760 --> 56:02.899
- What shall we...
- I must think.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.987
- When will you...
- Soon.

56:33.040 --> 56:34.382
(Cockerel crows)

56:36.960 --> 56:38.939
(Cantering horse approaches)

57:06.160 --> 57:07.627
What can I say?

57:08.440 --> 57:11.182
It was something...I cannot explain.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.904
You must see I had no choice!

57:23.960 --> 57:25.348
Nor I.
