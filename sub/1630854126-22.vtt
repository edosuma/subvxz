WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.046
Thank you, sir. Sounds like
quite the opportunity.

00:03.046 --> 00:05.657
I'll deliberate on the
objective and report back.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.094
Okay.
Okay, bye.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.530
- Boy, you in the FBI?
- What?

00:08.530 --> 00:10.053
No, I was just
talking to my dad.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.663
That's the way you
talk to your dad?

00:11.663 --> 00:14.101
Yes. Uh, he was asking me
to come up to Baltimore

00:14.101 --> 00:15.319
to work at his
landscaping company,

00:15.319 --> 00:17.365
but just for the summer.
- A likely story.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.062
Probably planning on
how to assassinate

00:19.062 --> 00:21.108
another Black community leader.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.718
COINTELPRO killed Teena Marie.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.111
- Teena Marie was white.
- To you.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.156
How would I even
get into the FBI?

00:26.156 --> 00:27.549
The same way you got
into the notoriously

00:27.549 --> 00:30.552
hard-to-break-into landscaping
industry--nepotism.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.206
You want to work
in landscaping?

00:32.206 --> 00:35.122
Of course.
I love nature.

00:35.122 --> 00:38.995
I'm a master forager.
My specialty--mushrooms.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.215
I don't know how to leave
this conversation

00:41.215 --> 00:43.173
Eddie Lawn and Care doesn't
even roll off the tongue.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.697
Mr. Johnson and Eddie
Landscaping on the other hand?

00:45.697 --> 00:47.482
Now, that's a company
you can trust.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.353
Okay, well,
if I don't take the gig,

00:49.353 --> 00:52.356
I'll be sure to put in
a good word for you.

00:52.356 --> 00:55.968
Oh, see you, Gregory.
Goodbye, Mr. Johnson.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.405
You know what?

00:57.405 --> 00:59.755
I'm just realizing I don't
know your first name.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.975
When you get home tonight,
look up in the sky.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.586
It's written in the stars.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.373
- He on one today.
- Okay.

01:24.258 --> 01:27.174
So what does a Gregory
pack for an overnight trip

01:27.174 --> 01:28.175
to the Franklin Institute?

01:28.175 --> 01:30.612
- We have a do-rag.
- Uh-huh.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.701
- All 13 essential vitamins.
- Of course.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.529
And night socks.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.226
- Night socks?
- Yeah.

01:36.226 --> 01:37.532
For after I take
off my day socks.

01:39.316 --> 01:41.275
Today's the big field trip
to the Franklin Institute,

01:41.275 --> 01:43.451
which is my favorite museum
of science and technology.

01:43.451 --> 01:47.063
- And it's a sleepover.
- Yes, our first sleepover.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.152
Because neither of us has
ever done a sleepover before.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.414
- With teachers.
- And the kids.

01:50.414 --> 01:51.676
- Everyone.
- Everyone's going to be there.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.200
There's going to be
a lot of people there.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.636
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.203
Man, I'm happy Ava paired
us up as group buddies.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.421
Now, don't ever
leave us behind.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.293
I need you to have my
back in case someone

01:59.293 --> 02:01.469
casts an ancient spell and
the exhibits come to life.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.471
I'm counting on those tiny
fists for very precise blows.

02:03.471 --> 02:06.256
Wait. So you did watch
"Night at the Museum"?

02:06.256 --> 02:08.084
Yeah.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.477
I take all your
recommendations seriously.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.043
I want to know why
you like stuff.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.224
Uh-uh.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.790
I don't like clanks in bags.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.444
Clank-clank lead
to the clink-clink.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.229
Meet Edith Houghton--

02:22.229 --> 02:25.014
named after the MLB's
first female scout

02:25.014 --> 02:27.059
for none other
than the Phillies.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.452
Can't sleep a wink without her.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.283
Dang, Barb.
Did you pack Gerald in there?

02:33.283 --> 02:34.284
We worked too hard
on this fundraiser

02:34.284 --> 02:36.330
to get kicked out

02:36.330 --> 02:38.114
because you want to get
freaky in Sir Isaac's Loft.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.595
I have an extensive
nighttime regimen

02:40.595 --> 02:44.207
that will not be abandoned
because of an overnight

02:44.207 --> 02:45.513
youth excursion.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.297
Explaining why
she hasn't aged

02:47.297 --> 02:48.516
since before the Internet.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.214
I know.
What you got in there?

02:51.214 --> 02:52.302
Did I hear the bell?

02:52.302 --> 02:53.173
No.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.004
Ha!

02:59.004 --> 03:01.268
Lucky us.
Two-bell day.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.269
Huh.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.534
Are we there yet?

03:06.534 --> 03:09.276
Uh, well, the buses
aren't even here yet, so, no.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.496
Okay.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.541
Oh.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.977
Hey, Maurice.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.984
- Hey, Janine.
- Hey, Maurice.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.333
Sorry for
the surprise appearance.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.639
We're just about to
go on a field trip.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.336
I did walk this way
assuming you'd be inside.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.859
Yeah.
I'm in there a lot.

03:29.557 --> 03:32.908
Oh. Look, I really wanted
to apologize

03:32.908 --> 03:34.997
for how things went down
at Bone Town.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.304
You ever notice how people
say they want to apologize

03:37.304 --> 03:39.306
instead of just apologizing?

03:39.306 --> 03:41.308
It's wild.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.919
- Well, I'm sorry.
- It's all good.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.268
Gregory told me
not to pursue you,

03:45.268 --> 03:47.357
and I did anyway,
so I guess we're both

03:47.357 --> 03:49.054
in our selfish eras.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.055
Wait.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.970
I'm not selfish.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.407
- You are.
- I'm not.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.886
Oh, hey, Mr. Eddie,

03:54.886 --> 03:56.584
just a heads-up that this one
is a tricky sleeper.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.368
He'll lay down, but that
is not the end of it.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.022
You got to watch him.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.328
He'll pretend to be asleep,
but he's not asleep.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.417
He is not asleep!

04:03.417 --> 04:04.853
Are you listening?
- Huh?

04:04.853 --> 04:06.420
Wait, wait, wait.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.508
So, for clarity, you don't
think you were being selfish?

04:07.508 --> 04:09.379
No.

04:09.379 --> 04:10.424
Oh, so it's normal
for you to invite a guy

04:10.424 --> 04:12.426
to his favorite
barbecue restaurant

04:12.426 --> 04:14.036
just to break up with him
in front of his friend

04:14.036 --> 04:17.344
who you kissed
but didn't actually date?

04:17.344 --> 04:18.432
I didn't think
of it that way.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.607
Yeah.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.783
It stung a little bit,
but it's all good.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.393
I, too, become
selfish sometimes.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.395
For example, I'm ghosting
this girl right now.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.136
You know, she thinks I'm dead,

04:27.136 --> 04:29.617
but this convo, it inspired
me to reach out to her,

04:29.617 --> 04:31.358
send her a text.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.229
I wouldn't want to hurt her.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.454
<i>I felt like I was making
a lot of progress this year,</i>

04:40.454 --> 04:44.588
<i>but to find out that I hurt
someone who didn't deserve it,</i>

04:44.588 --> 04:47.374
without knowing,
because I'm selfish...

04:47.374 --> 04:49.158
I never want to do that again.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.424
Come on in.
Go ahead.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.600
Okay, guys.
- Here we go.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.601
Thanks.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.957
Ariana, you're
falling behind.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.394
Come on.
You got to keep up.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.222
Mr. Eddie, my shoulders
don't work anymore.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.746
Oh, no.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.487
Okay, you want me to hold your
backpack for a little bit?

05:13.487 --> 05:15.445
Okay.
There we go.

05:15.445 --> 05:18.143
Well, good thing I took
all those vitamins, right?

05:18.143 --> 05:20.450
All right, guys.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.886
Let's go see another exhibit.
Come on.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.584
There's a bunch of stuff here,
not just Ben Franklin.

05:23.584 --> 05:24.628
Come on.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.415
Don't be shy
if you have questions.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.417
Rail transportation
transformed America,

05:30.417 --> 05:32.636
and it could happen
again today

05:32.636 --> 05:33.637
if we invest
in high-speed rail.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.030
Amen, sister.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.423
Yeah, if we harness
today's technology,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.512
trains could get
to Washington, D.C.,

05:38.512 --> 05:41.384
in just half an hour.
- And, more importantly,

05:41.384 --> 05:42.690
it could get
out of Washington, D.C.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.648
and back to Philadelphia
in 30 minutes,

05:44.648 --> 05:47.216
which is 29 minutes longer
than the ideal scenario.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.174
Well, I don't know
that I would be in such a rush

05:49.174 --> 05:50.785
to leave our nation's capital.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.526
Yeah, you're forgetting
that Philadelphia

05:52.526 --> 05:54.005
was the capital first.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.659
- Really?
- Yes.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.400
Okay, yes.
She--You know that.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.532
She knew that.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.577
As did I. Yeah.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.450
This is a museum, but
let's not live in the past.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.712
Where are you from?

06:04.712 --> 06:07.454
Uh, Westchester...

06:07.454 --> 06:09.456
New York.
- Yeah. Unbelievable.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.893
So youse people move here,
you don't learn the history,

06:11.893 --> 06:14.461
and then you got the
nerve to work at a museum.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.158
Well, I'm a volunteer.

06:16.158 --> 06:19.466
And you are worth every penny
they're paying you, sweetheart.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.512
Okay. Let's see
Miss Schemmenti's neighborhood.

06:29.127 --> 06:31.521
"The unbounded
emptiness of space

06:31.521 --> 06:33.915
is incomprehensible
to the human mind."

06:33.915 --> 06:36.134
Hmm. I don't know why they're
wasting time telling you

06:36.134 --> 06:37.484
about what isn't out there.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.486
You need to be worried
about what is.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.704
What are you saying?

06:40.704 --> 06:43.054
There are at least
100 billion galaxies.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.535
Do you think that Earth is the
only place hospitable to life

06:45.535 --> 06:47.102
in 100 billion galaxies?

06:47.102 --> 06:48.712
Are you saying
aliens are real?

06:48.712 --> 06:50.714
Of course they're real.

06:50.714 --> 06:51.933
What I'm saying is, they
might already be here.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.717
Ava, you're frightening
the children.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.327
I just want them
to be prepared.

06:55.327 --> 06:58.505
More than 80% of the ocean has
never been explored by humans.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.724
Aliens might already be
here, drinking mai tais

07:00.724 --> 07:02.378
and using the Indian Ocean
as a lazy river.

07:12.649 --> 07:13.737
Oh, hi.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.913
Mr. Eddie taught
me a train song.

07:15.913 --> 07:19.613
♪ Chugga chugga, chugga chugga,
chugga chugga, free hugs! ♪

07:19.613 --> 07:20.570
Oh!

07:27.751 --> 07:29.231
Hey.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.798
So you seem completely
unaffected by the cutest thing

07:30.798 --> 07:32.364
I've ever taught a child.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.323
Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

07:34.323 --> 07:35.890
So I talked
to my dad earlier.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.761
He wants me to come
up to Baltimore for the summer.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.502
- Mm.
- It's only an hour away...

07:39.502 --> 07:40.982
- Mm. Mm.
- By train.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.636
But I was thinking

07:42.636 --> 07:45.769
that maybe I'd stay in Philly
for the summer.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.642
You know, if you
had any thoughts...

07:48.642 --> 07:49.556
Oh, wow.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.775
Uh...

07:51.775 --> 07:55.605
well, do you want to go?
- Maybe.

07:55.605 --> 08:00.001
But I thought maybe we could
hang out some for the summer.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.611
I know there's two or three
more "Night at the Museums"

08:01.611 --> 08:03.657
we could watch.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.354
You've seen one, you've
seen them all, you know.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.182
Look, staying here
could be cool,

08:07.182 --> 08:09.576
but going to Baltimore
sounds great.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.795
See family, you know?

08:11.795 --> 08:12.927
You should do
whatever you want,

08:12.927 --> 08:15.843
what--whatever you want to do.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.802
Hey, Jalen, let someone else
have a turn on the train.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.717
Oh, God.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.372
I'm tired, too.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.595
Let's go.
Lie down.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.640
Here you go.
Help me. Grab the bottom end.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.816
Oh.

08:32.816 --> 08:35.297
Excuse me.
Are there any private quarters?

08:35.297 --> 08:38.213
Uh, we've got kids by
the train and in the map room.

08:38.213 --> 08:39.693
Ooh, the one place that's empty

08:39.693 --> 08:41.825
is the galaxy room, although
it can feel kind of creepy

08:41.825 --> 08:44.828
in there at night.
- That's perfect. Thank you.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.613
Hey, Barb.
Don't listen to this clown.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.831
She's not even from Philly.

08:47.831 --> 08:48.919
Does that preclude me

08:48.919 --> 08:50.878
from knowing
the layout of the museum?

08:50.878 --> 08:52.314
Probably.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.709
What's the matter? You don't
want to sleep in here with us?

08:55.709 --> 08:59.060
I do, but I need space
to calm my kids down.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.236
My class and half the school
is traumatized

09:01.236 --> 09:03.630
after hearing
Ava Night Shyamalan.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.678
That's the name
she remembers?

09:08.678 --> 09:10.637
Ooh, can't believe I snagged
a spot next to your group.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.725
Hey, do you remember what to do

09:11.725 --> 09:13.335
if I start having sleep
paralysis?

09:13.335 --> 09:15.076
Um, shake you
till you wake up?

09:15.076 --> 09:16.643
What? No, no.
Gently cradle my head--

09:16.643 --> 09:18.209
Can we talk?

09:20.951 --> 09:23.911
Hey, has Janine been
acting different?

09:23.911 --> 09:26.696
Uh, honestly, I haven't
seen her that much today.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.655
Ava paired me with Morton,
so all of my energy

09:28.655 --> 09:29.873
has gone into keeping my cool.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.701
He better watch it.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.703
You know, Night Jacob,
he's got that dog in him.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.096
- Can we get back to Janine?
- Yes.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.663
Um, what did--what did she say

09:36.663 --> 09:37.881
when you asked her
what's wrong?

09:37.881 --> 09:39.753
Uh...

09:39.753 --> 09:41.276
You didn't ask her?
Sheesh.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.669
It is no wonder your dad
is a landscaper,

09:42.669 --> 09:43.670
the way you beat
around the bush.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.367
All right, calm down.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.934
You know, sometimes
I think you two

09:46.934 --> 09:48.675
should just, like,
kiss and get it over with.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.684
You need to be better about
hiding things with your face.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.685
Sorry.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.774
Deet me.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.776
- It was PECSA weekend.
- Frickin' classic.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.430
We got a little tipsy
in the living classroom.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.693
We just got lost in the moment.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.172
She and I drove
home together.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.305
She did not say a word--
treachery of the highest order.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.741
Don't be mad at Janine--
after we kissed,

10:11.741 --> 10:13.395
we said we weren't
going to talk about it.

10:13.395 --> 10:14.701
Okay, well, you have to know
that that is a very strange way

10:14.701 --> 10:16.441
to handle that.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.704
Maybe.

10:17.704 --> 10:18.705
You two have done
everything but tell

10:18.705 --> 10:20.315
each other how you feel.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.708
You--you have to
tell her how you feel.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.799
There's no real going
back after that, is there?

10:25.799 --> 10:27.757
Nope.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.672
But there might be a lot of
good stuff on the other side.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.284
Bro hug?

10:35.286 --> 10:36.287
Yeah.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.821
Hey. I made an alien
drawing for you.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.737
What do you think?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.782
Now, see, this is
where they get you.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.784
What if they're humanoids
that look just like us?

10:54.784 --> 10:56.090
The only difference might be,

10:56.090 --> 10:58.005
they're not used
to our atmosphere.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.703
So their only giveaway would
be a breathing apparatus?

11:00.703 --> 11:01.791
Exactly.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.796
So I don't get a thank-you

11:06.796 --> 11:08.363
for putting you
next to your little boyfriend?

11:08.363 --> 11:09.973
What are you talking about?

11:09.973 --> 11:11.366
I made you class
buddies with Gregory.

11:11.366 --> 11:12.976
You can thank me after you
have your really short,

11:12.976 --> 11:14.456
broad-shouldered babies.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.110
That man built like
the Longhorn logo.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.590
Hey, he is not my boyfriend.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.204
Ava, has anyone ever
called you selfish?

11:23.204 --> 11:25.989
All the time. My grandma
called me selfish this morning.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.817
- Right.
- But I don't care.

11:27.817 --> 11:28.775
I take care of myself.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.038
And I see you doing it, too.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.823
Going on your little vacation.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.782
Stealing money from your mama.
- That's not what happened.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.218
Whatever.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.872
But it looks good on you.

11:38.872 --> 11:42.092
As long as you're not hurting
anybody, what's the problem?

11:42.092 --> 11:44.355
Hey.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.140
Uh, once the kids go to sleep,
you think we could talk?

11:48.229 --> 11:51.058
Um...

11:51.058 --> 11:52.842
You know what? I think
it'd be better if I was over

11:52.842 --> 11:54.496
by, you know, Barbara's class,

11:54.496 --> 11:55.889
because she has this
white-noise machine

11:55.889 --> 11:56.846
that I was really
trying to use.

11:56.846 --> 11:57.847
I might get one of those.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.806
So, um, everybody
in my class, up.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.372
Let's go, let's go.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.026
We're going to go over to
sleep next to Mrs. Howard.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.375
Grab your things.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.684
Ah.
Hey, Barbara.

12:08.684 --> 12:09.859
We're just going to
scooch in next to y'all.

12:09.859 --> 12:13.036
Scooching is an act
best done silently.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.081
Good night.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.082
All right.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.823
Scooch in, you guys.

12:16.823 --> 12:17.867
Shh, quietly.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.869
Hmm.

12:19.869 --> 12:20.870
Not what I thought
a white-noise machine

12:20.870 --> 12:22.176
would sound like.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.047
All right, guys, quietly.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.701
Lay down.

12:27.877 --> 12:30.053
- So how'd it go?
- Great.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.402
He hasn't moved in,
like, 15 minutes.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.839
It's kind of creepy, actually.
- No, no.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.884
I'm talking about Janine.
- Oh.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.712
Well, I asked if we
could talk and she moved

12:36.712 --> 12:39.062
her kids to the other room,
so that's that, I guess.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.542
Oh, yeah.
That's that.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.065
Yeah, you'll probably
never see her again.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.806
- Relax.
- I'm relaxed, man.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.068
You relax, okay?

12:45.068 --> 12:47.070
Everybody I like knows it.

12:47.070 --> 12:50.204
Zach and Diego Luna
have seen my tweets, so...

13:05.915 --> 13:08.048
Hey.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.963
Hi.

13:09.963 --> 13:13.096
So this morning you
seemed really excited

13:13.096 --> 13:15.359
to have our classes
paired together.

13:15.359 --> 13:18.885
And then you talked to Maurice,
and now things feel different.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.451
Yeah.
That wasn't about you.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.105
Well, it sure
seemed like it was.

13:22.105 --> 13:25.152
Okay, look, Gregory,
don't worry about it.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.241
Just forget it.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.895
But I don't
want to forget it.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.722
Why not?
- Because I like you, Janine.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.903
I have feelings for you, and--

13:36.903 --> 13:38.905
Watch it!

13:41.908 --> 13:43.910
Alien!

13:56.009 --> 13:57.749
Where is it?

14:01.188 --> 14:03.277
Let's do this.

14:03.277 --> 14:06.149
- Did y'all see the alien?
- Yeah, we just want to talk.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.803
Barbara is the alien.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.805
Melissa, I would never
ask you to take Barbara out.

14:09.805 --> 14:13.156
Jacob, take the bat.
- Everybody, please calm down.

14:13.156 --> 14:16.594
This whole hubbub started
because the kids saw this.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.031
Barb!

14:18.031 --> 14:20.163
You already killed the alien
by ripping off his mask?

14:20.163 --> 14:22.949
She's a hero, y'all!

14:22.949 --> 14:25.952
This is my CPAP machine.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.215
I was recently diagnosed
with sleep apnea,

14:28.215 --> 14:31.000
so I use a CPAP machine.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.960
I'm obviously very particular
about how I present myself,

14:33.960 --> 14:36.527
so I tried to hide it.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.920
I was wearing this.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.966
And because of Ava's antics,

14:39.966 --> 14:43.752
the kids thought
that I was an alien.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.972
So it was just
a misunderstanding.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.409
What a relief!

14:48.409 --> 14:50.977
And no one to blame, at that.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.979
Y'all go ahead, round up the
kids so I can go to sleep.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.981
If I don't get a smooth
11 hours,

14:54.981 --> 14:56.330
I get a little handsy.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.857
- You okay?
- Fine.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.599
Okay, a little embarrassed.
- Ah, don't be embarrassed.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.427
You're aging with dignity.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.212
Meanwhile, I got to pack
an extra pair of underwear

15:09.212 --> 15:10.387
if I plan on laughing that day.

15:10.387 --> 15:13.216
Come on. Come on.
- You know...

15:13.216 --> 15:14.739
Let's get the kids.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.012
- Hey.
- No kids in this ventricle.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.101
None in this atrium, so...

15:37.066 --> 15:39.025
I like you, too...

15:39.025 --> 15:41.027
like, a lot.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.465
I kind of knew that.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.990
Whatever.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.427
So for how long
did you like me?

15:50.427 --> 15:52.038
Like, how long?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.127
Pretty much since the
first day I got to Abbott.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.259
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.261
Me too.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.871
But I couldn't really
admit it, because--

15:59.871 --> 16:01.090
- Tariq. Yeah.
- Right.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.268
So, if you liked me
for that long,

16:05.268 --> 16:07.096
then what was
the whole Taylor thing?

16:07.096 --> 16:08.750
You were in

16:08.750 --> 16:10.056
a multi-presidential-term
relationship when--

16:10.056 --> 16:11.100
Okay.
But then I wasn't.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.406
Are we really
about to do this?

16:12.406 --> 16:14.408
- And then Amber.
- Hey, she asked me out.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.062
And you was giving me nothing.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.150
Kissing you was
giving you nothing?

16:17.150 --> 16:18.368
You called it a whoops.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.109
You could have said
it wasn't a whoops.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.068
Look, I didn't think it
was an accident or a mistake.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.113
Besides, you started
dating Maurice.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.072
We were both
all over the place.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.074
But we're here...

16:29.162 --> 16:31.468
Now.

16:40.347 --> 16:44.046
Look, talking to Mo,
it did change things.

16:45.830 --> 16:49.791
But it didn't change
how I feel about you.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.923
It changed how I feel about me.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.795
What are you saying?

16:53.795 --> 16:57.103
Gregory, I come
to school every day happy

16:57.103 --> 17:00.367
because I get to see you

17:00.367 --> 17:04.762
and have a friend like you,
and I cannot lose that friend.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.069
But maybe I am selfish.

17:07.069 --> 17:10.159
And if I need to be right now,

17:10.159 --> 17:13.075
then I don't want to wind up
hurting you.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.166
It's you.

17:17.166 --> 17:22.084
And if we did this,
then it would be--

17:22.084 --> 17:23.346
Something real.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.087
Yeah.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.136
I understand.

17:35.141 --> 17:38.100
We should get back.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.014
Yeah.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.723
I'm still here, buddy.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.119
Hey, how'd it go?

18:02.255 --> 18:03.604
Bro hug?

18:15.485 --> 18:16.443
All right.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.228
Now, it's me.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.360
Still me.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.188
Besides, would an alien
sound like...

18:25.234 --> 18:27.236
Absolutely.

18:27.236 --> 18:28.542
Go to sleep.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.476
- Ms. Schemmenti?
- Yeah, hon?

18:49.476 --> 18:51.173
Thanks for telling me
about Guion Bluford.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.435
I'm going to be
an astronaut, too.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.654
Yeah?

18:53.654 --> 18:54.959
Maybe you'll be
the first person

18:54.959 --> 18:56.222
to eat a hoagie in space.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.441
I hate
to admit it,

18:58.441 --> 19:00.356
but I actually learned
some stuff from you.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.228
I didn't know that America's
first hospital was in Philly.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.317
Mm-hmm.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.275
I guess I should step up
some of my local knowledge.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.972
Have you ever thought
about volunteering?

19:07.972 --> 19:09.844
Work for free?

19:09.844 --> 19:12.499
Yeah, you're really
not from Philly, are you, hon?

19:23.510 --> 19:26.513
Got all yours?

19:26.513 --> 19:28.297
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.302
<i>I think I did the right thing.</i>

19:33.302 --> 19:35.522
<i>I want to continue
the path I'm on.</i>

19:35.522 --> 19:40.266
<i>I actually think selfish
is good for me, for now.</i>

19:40.266 --> 19:42.920
And Gregory is great.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.488
He's the greatest, actually.

19:45.488 --> 19:49.231
I guess I'm not ready for him,
but that's okay.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.279
I'm okay.

19:57.326 --> 19:58.501
<i>I'm okay.</i>

19:58.501 --> 19:59.894
<i>Really.</i>

19:59.894 --> 20:01.287
<i>I'm happy I put it out there,</i>

20:01.287 --> 20:03.289
<i>even if it didn't go
how I wanted.</i>

20:03.289 --> 20:05.552
<i>And, uh, Jacob was right.</i>

20:05.552 --> 20:08.337
There's some
good stuff on the other side.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.821
It's time
to plant something new.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.303
Hey.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.392
You want to grab
something to eat?

20:19.392 --> 20:20.393
Maybe.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.308
Is Jacob coming?

20:22.308 --> 20:25.311
He is.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.400
G-Man.
Don't worry.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.662
Every spot on my spreadsheet
of local restaurants

20:28.662 --> 20:30.533
has something you love--water.

20:30.533 --> 20:33.188
Ah, yeah, let's go.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.369
After-school crew
is back, baby!

20:40.369 --> 20:42.197
That--
All right.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.597
Ava, I'm cashing in my time
off for the rest of the year

20:50.597 --> 20:53.687
to go work with Gregory's dad
at the landscaping company

20:53.687 --> 20:55.341
in Baltimore.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.342
There's six more weeks
of school left,

20:56.342 --> 20:57.560
and you don't have
any days banked.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.345
You go fishing
every other week.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.911
That's because
I'm single-handedly trying

21:00.911 --> 21:03.392
to control the
snakehead fish population.

21:03.392 --> 21:04.959
I'll see you
at work tomorrow.

21:04.959 --> 21:09.355
No offense to your little
job here, but I got to do me.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.313
Wait, what?

21:11.313 --> 21:12.401
Hey!

21:12.401 --> 21:15.143
Hey, come back here!

21:19.626 --> 21:22.063
Oh, now you can walk fast.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.285
<i>Delicious.</i>
