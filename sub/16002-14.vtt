00:00.417 --> 00:02.417
[Brian] Previously
on What About Brian:

00:02.417 --> 00:04.417
- Stay as long as you want.
- Thanks.

00:04.417 --> 00:07.458
- On the couch.
- They do Carrie's
surgery Friday.

00:07.458 --> 00:09.875
- How you doing?
- The IRS came down

00:09.875 --> 00:13.834
and issued an arrest warrant
for your father. It's gone.

00:13.834 --> 00:17.458
- What's gone?
- Jobs, commissions, everything.

00:17.458 --> 00:19.792
Think they'll ever
announce partnerships?

00:19.792 --> 00:21.959
- You got it, didn't you?
- I did.

00:21.959 --> 00:24.083
- Who else?
- Richardson.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.417
- Ah!
- Sorry, man.

00:39.792 --> 00:41.834
- What the...?
- Hi.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.792
This is gonna be
the best day of work ever.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.417
What?

00:51.417 --> 00:55.291
They're interviewing
for your assistant job.
They're all here for you.

00:55.291 --> 00:57.000
Ladies, how we feeling?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.875
I never should've
fired Lindsay.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.792
Do not have second thoughts.
You did the right thing.

01:01.792 --> 01:05.875
You asked for staples
and she gave you one.
One staple. Who does that?

01:05.875 --> 01:09.959
She wasn't exactly a good
assistant. I'll give you that.

01:09.959 --> 01:11.959
Right with you,
just one second.

01:11.959 --> 01:14.709
You're going through
some changes. I get that.

01:14.709 --> 01:17.709
You break up with your wife
and your fiancée hours apart.

01:17.709 --> 01:22.709
- Thanks for the reminder.
- Sorry.
How you handling all of this?

01:22.709 --> 01:28.208
I'm OK. You know, the
Marjorie-Heather thing, I know
it was the right decision...

01:29.875 --> 01:33.041
- I don't know.
- Need a hug? Come on.

01:33.041 --> 01:35.000
No. I need to make partner.
Soon.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.875
So I'm gonna work my ass off
so they have to notice me.

01:37.875 --> 01:40.834
I say you get your ass
back on the market.

01:40.834 --> 01:44.792
The last time you got my ass
back out on the market,
I ended up married,

01:44.792 --> 01:47.041
which I'm now
in the process of undoing.

01:47.041 --> 01:50.166
That was my wife's fault,
not mine. Women.

01:50.166 --> 01:55.208
Women. Exactly. Which
is why I have made a decision.

01:55.208 --> 01:58.250
I, Adam Hillman,
am taking a vow of celibacy.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.709
- A vow of what?
- No sex until I make partner.

02:01.709 --> 02:03.333
Women have
caused me problems.

02:03.333 --> 02:06.583
I've been to jail, in fights,
I nearly lost my friend,

02:06.583 --> 02:08.250
and I haven't made partner.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.417
So I'm eliminating women
altogether.

02:10.417 --> 02:14.083
No sex, no dating, no long
talks about your feelings,

02:14.083 --> 02:16.125
because before you know it,
you're...

02:16.125 --> 02:19.417
Sucking you in and
you're married in
a hotel room in Vegas.

02:19.417 --> 02:22.709
So do me a favor, Jimmy,
and send those
women out there home.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.250
You trying to make me cry?

02:24.250 --> 02:27.208
No, my friend.
I'm just trying to make partner.

02:29.917 --> 02:33.583
The surgery will take
a couple hours,
so if you need to do anything,

02:33.583 --> 02:36.125
- do it now before we start.
- I'm sorry. Remind me

02:36.125 --> 02:39.083
- how long she'll
be in recovery.
- Two to four hours.

02:39.083 --> 02:42.750
How many weeks before we turn on
the implant to see if it worked?

02:42.750 --> 02:44.917
Not for another
month or so.

02:44.917 --> 02:48.041
I know you're nervous.
Everything's going to be fine.

02:48.041 --> 02:51.458
Let's just get Carrie out
of surgery and we'll go
from there.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.250
OK.

03:06.125 --> 03:10.625
I can't go in there.
I can't watch.

03:10.625 --> 03:14.291
If you don't want
to go in there,
you don't have to. It's fine.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.667
Doesn't that make me a bad mom?

03:16.667 --> 03:20.583
No, of course not.
You're not a bad mom. You're
the best mom in the world.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.500
Take care of my baby, OK?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.625
- I will.
- OK.

03:24.625 --> 03:28.750
Come here. It'll be OK.

03:37.041 --> 03:38.959
[man] Well,
the man is your father.

03:38.959 --> 03:41.000
And, aside from his wife,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.125
if he's called anyone,
it would be...

03:43.125 --> 03:47.041
I told you I haven't
heard from him. I wouldn't
answer if he did call.

03:47.041 --> 03:50.083
He was also your boss,
and he ripped off
the government.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.709
If and when he turns up,
he's going to prison.

03:52.709 --> 03:55.333
Are we going to get
the money owed to us?

03:55.333 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, that's
not going to happen.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.625
See, the IRS has first dibs
on any money we find.
And your father...

04:00.625 --> 04:03.792
Excuse me,"boss"... owed a lot.

04:03.792 --> 04:07.500
I get out of debt
and there's $50,000 dollars
out there I'm never seeing?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.917
I'm afraid
Miss Keller's got it worse.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.166
Your condo. It was purchased
under the company name.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.583
Because Michael
co-signed on the loan.

04:15.583 --> 04:19.875
Technically, it's Davis Realty
property. We're seizing
and reselling it.

04:22.125 --> 04:25.208
- Where am I supposed to live?
- You could buy it back.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.166
If you have $400,000
lying around.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.542
Anyway, thank you for your time.

04:29.542 --> 04:33.041
And remember, if you do hear
from Mr. Davis,
please let us know.

04:33.041 --> 04:34.667
It would be a felony not to.

04:38.917 --> 04:42.917
- [Brian] Any word?
- Why is it taking so long?
They should've been done.

04:42.917 --> 04:45.667
If something was wrong,
someone would have told you.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.208
Hey, there they are.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.959
The operation went
as well as we had hoped.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.917
- It went perfectly.
Doc's a genius.
- How's my baby?

04:56.917 --> 04:59.583
She's a champ, Deen.
Tough just like her Mom.

04:59.583 --> 05:03.166
- Yeah.
- It's going to be OK.

05:04.834 --> 05:07.583
- Hey, Doc.
- Thanks for coming.

05:07.583 --> 05:10.625
- That's good.
- [Jimmy] Good. Good news.

05:16.917 --> 05:22.083
I remember how to get there,
Roy, it hasn't been that long.
See you then. Bye-bye.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.000
Hi. How'd it go
with Carrie?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.792
Really well.
She's doing great. Who's Roy?

05:28.792 --> 05:32.417
Oh, from Asteria Realty.
They want to talk about opening

05:32.417 --> 05:35.458
a new office and I have
three interviews tomorrow.

05:35.458 --> 05:39.166
- Four interviews? Already?
- I can't just sit
on the sofa all day.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.125
I can put a word in for you.

05:41.125 --> 05:44.834
Really, I'm good.
What's happening with the condo?

05:44.834 --> 05:47.291
What did the lawyer say?

05:47.291 --> 05:49.667
There's nothing
I can do about it. It's gone.

05:49.667 --> 05:53.667
You know what? I think losing
the condo, losing the money,

05:53.667 --> 05:56.083
it's the universe
sending us a sign.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.959
I think you were
meant to move in with me.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.291
Has the universe
actually seen this place?

06:01.291 --> 06:05.875
- I'm not taking no
for an answer.
- OK. If I move in here,

06:05.875 --> 06:09.917
you have to promise
that we're not going
to be nitpicky about stuff.

06:09.917 --> 06:14.542
Not going to get in
arguments about cleaning
and dishes and drawers, OK?

06:16.166 --> 06:17.917
This is our house now.

06:17.917 --> 06:22.208
I don't have any drawers
to fight about. All your
stuff is in my bedroom anyway.

06:22.208 --> 06:26.792
You really think that's
all the stuff I have?
Boy, are you in trouble.

06:28.834 --> 06:31.208
This is really a
big step for you, isn't it?

06:31.208 --> 06:36.667
Humongous. But it feels right.
The two of us. Here. Huh?

06:36.667 --> 06:38.667
Mm-hm.

06:40.542 --> 06:43.041
- [door opening]
- Hey, honeys, I'm home.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.750
You guys hungry?

I just couldn't find my belt.

07:42.917 --> 07:46.709
We're still a little

07:46.709 --> 07:47.917

- Mm-hm.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.792
So you got any big plans today?

07:49.792 --> 07:51.875
Mm. I thought I'd sleep in.

07:51.875 --> 07:57.333
- Yeah, I mean after that.
- Well, we're out of trash bags.

08:06.125 --> 08:07.500
Honey?

08:07.500 --> 08:09.458
- Yeah.
- Have you seen my hair dryer?

08:09.458 --> 08:13.083
Oh. I put it in the closet.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.250
There wasn't much room
in the bathroom, you know.

08:15.250 --> 08:18.583
With the curling iron
and straightening thing.
I'm sorry. Is that OK?

08:18.583 --> 08:23.458
Of course. I'm taking up
all this space here,
so the closet's fine with me.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.125
I could put it somewhere else.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.417
No, no. That's great.
The closet's fine.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.458
I got it.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.000
Hi. Nice hair.
I thought you were sleeping in.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.125
Didn't happen.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.834
OK, I'm leaving.

08:51.834 --> 08:55.125
Another job interview. I thought
you had a million offers?

08:55.125 --> 08:58.458
Yeah, I'm playing them against
each other. It's about strategy.

08:58.458 --> 09:01.625
- [Brian] Ah.
- You should watch and learn,
honey.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.000
Oh, I'm watching.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.041
- Oh, I get one, huh?
- Yeah.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.166
Yeah. I'm learning.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.709
All right, baby. Good luck.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.792
Promise me you'll never leave.

09:14.792 --> 09:17.792
I need buffer between
me and her or I'll explode.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.041
What? Things are great.

09:19.041 --> 09:21.041
It's all fake.
I can't do it, man.

09:21.041 --> 09:24.542
This was a mistake. All the
politeness and thoughtfulness.

09:24.542 --> 09:27.792
The "honey," the "sweetie,"
the hair dryer... It's too much.

09:27.792 --> 09:31.500
Do you know how many times
I've said "I'm sorry"
in the last two days?

09:31.500 --> 09:34.208
- Fifteen times.
- OK, easy with
the controller, buddy.

09:34.208 --> 09:39.417
Sorry. You know,
what was I thinking?
Moving in with someone?

09:39.417 --> 09:44.667
I have to be on my best behavior
all the time. It's not possible.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.375
This is no way to live.

09:46.375 --> 09:49.250
All right. Calm it down.
Take a deep breath.

09:49.250 --> 09:52.750
- There you go.
- OK. OK. I'm calm. I'm calm.

09:52.750 --> 09:56.417
You know what you need? You need
a night out with the boys.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.208
Yeah. Well, that sounds great.

09:58.208 --> 10:01.208
Except one won't come out
with us because he's celibate.

10:01.208 --> 10:03.875
How are you two single
and I'm living with someone?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.583
How did I become the normal one?

10:05.583 --> 10:08.333
You are so far from normal
that it actually scares me.

10:10.166 --> 10:13.041
Shut up. Game on.

10:18.709 --> 10:21.583
You guys are lifesavers.
I just can't thank you enough.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.250
Don't thank me. I've eaten
more than I've frosted.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.083
What kid has 200 people
at her birthday party?

10:27.083 --> 10:31.875
- It's L.A.
- It's good to have an excuse to
just hang out with the girls.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.917
If you want time away from
your guys, start a book club.

10:37.083 --> 10:40.709
- Everybody's doing it.
- Do we get to drink
at this book club?

10:40.709 --> 10:42.625
- Definitely.
- Mm. Sold.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.041
Know any books?

10:44.041 --> 10:47.458
- [Bella crying]
- I got it.

10:47.458 --> 10:51.208
- He's great.
- Why are the perfect ones
always gay?

10:51.208 --> 10:53.875
- Who said he was gay?
- I just assumed.

10:53.875 --> 10:58.208
Well, I don't know
if he is or not, but, you know,
it doesn't matter either way.

10:58.208 --> 11:02.583
If a hot straight guy
is practically living
under your roof, it matters.

11:02.583 --> 11:05.917
Well, he's the nanny
and he's living under my roof.

11:05.917 --> 11:09.959
No. He is the manny.
Are we supposed to ignore
the fact that he has a penis?

11:09.959 --> 11:11.417
Penis. [laughing]

11:13.166 --> 11:16.458
Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm not
going to be seeing much of him.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.291
- I'm going back
to work part-time.
- Starting when?

11:19.291 --> 11:21.625
- Tomorrow.
- Wow.

11:21.625 --> 11:26.750
It's weird, but I was
feeling like something was
missing, so back to work.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.250
OK. I've got
the perfect book for you ladies.

11:29.250 --> 11:32.417
Romantic, sexy, tragic.
The Notebook.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.625
The Notebook.

11:40.959 --> 11:42.208
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.917
Thanks for meeting so last
minute. Sorry I'm late.

11:44.917 --> 11:48.542
- No problem. What's up?
- Well, I don't know.
You tell me.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.542
What's going on
with your friend?

11:50.542 --> 11:53.500
He's been acting really
weird since I moved in and...

11:53.500 --> 11:56.291
- I mean, weirder than usual.
- Well, I...

11:56.291 --> 12:00.041
I don't want you in
an awkward position,
and I can do this myself,

12:00.041 --> 12:04.542
it's just that I've been
on my best behavior,
I don't want to freak him out.

12:04.542 --> 12:07.250
We've been tiptoeing
around each other lately

12:07.250 --> 12:09.166
and walking on eggshells and...

12:09.166 --> 12:12.041
Do you have any idea how
we've apologized in two days?

12:12.041 --> 12:14.166
- Fifteen?
- Probably.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.166
I can't live like this anymore.

12:18.375 --> 12:21.166
You know what?
Neither can I.

12:22.333 --> 12:25.000
Which is why
I think I'm going to leave.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.834
No, Dave. That's not what
I'm trying to say at all.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.166
I know you're
not saying that at all.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.208
While I'm there, you are
never going to know what
it's like to live together.

12:34.208 --> 12:37.917
You're always going
to have this 34 year old
kid hanging around.

12:37.917 --> 12:41.000
- Where're you going to go?
- I don't know.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.208
I always seem
to figure it out though.

12:52.458 --> 12:55.583
You going to bring a sleeping
bag anytime soon, Hillman?

12:55.583 --> 12:57.333
- Mr. Green.
- Peter.

12:57.333 --> 13:02.041
Peter. I'd probably get more
work done if I didn't have
to go home and sleep.

13:02.041 --> 13:07.417
I hear you. When I was
your age I remember sleeping
in my office a few times.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.875
Sometimes even alone.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.000
It's late.
What are you working on?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.208
Actually, I'm just playing
some catch up on some paperwork.

13:14.208 --> 13:17.083
I let my assistant go
and I haven't replaced her.

13:17.083 --> 13:20.583
- Good move. She was terrible.
- You noticed her?

13:20.583 --> 13:24.250
Hillman, you will
learn very quickly
that I notice everything.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.417
[phone ringing]

13:26.417 --> 13:29.709
I'll let you get that.
Keep up the good work.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.458
I noticed that, too.

13:34.041 --> 13:35.750
Adam Hillman speaking.

13:35.750 --> 13:39.041
- Brian Davis listening.
- What do you want? I'm working.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.834
That's why I'm calling.
You're coming out with us.

13:41.834 --> 13:44.250
Unless "out" means my office,
the answer is no.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.250
What are you doing here?

13:47.250 --> 13:50.917
- Don't you have
anything better to do?
- Us? No.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.083
We're going out.
Guys' night out. Let's go.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.000
- Can't. I'm working.
- Not anymore.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.959
- Dude, this is an intervention.
- I took a vow, remember?

13:59.959 --> 14:01.667
We don't want
to have sex with you.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.959
- We want to go out.
- I'm not going anywhere.

14:03.959 --> 14:08.166
- Look, you're coming with us.
- Well, where're we going?

14:08.166 --> 14:10.667
[hip-hop plays]

14:10.667 --> 14:14.041
The night is great.
Going out without the girls.

14:14.041 --> 14:16.166
Without any girls.

14:17.166 --> 14:20.458
See? We respected the vow.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.250
- First timer?
- Excuse me?

14:33.250 --> 14:36.000
- I've never
seen you here before.
- Oh, yeah.

14:36.583 --> 14:37.750
I'm Andrew.

14:39.417 --> 14:43.250
Excuse me. Just so you
know up front,
he's taken a vow of celibacy.

14:43.250 --> 14:48.000
And I'm not gay, but
thanks for the compliment.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.834
No problem.

14:49.834 --> 14:52.750
I'm telling you, guys.
This vow of celibacy thing?

14:52.750 --> 14:55.834
People sense it and they
want to break it. It's genius.

14:55.834 --> 14:59.125
Why of the two of us
did he think I was the gay one?

14:59.125 --> 15:02.875
- You waxed your chest.
- One time for the swim team!

15:02.875 --> 15:07.166
Hey, there's a table
over there open next
to those guys. Adam, come on.

15:07.166 --> 15:10.291
Can I talk to you
about something?

15:10.291 --> 15:15.125
- Oh, God. You coming out?
- No. I'm moving out.

15:15.125 --> 15:19.500
What? Why? I told you not to.
Did I do something wrong?
Did Bridget?

15:19.500 --> 15:20.875
It's her fault, isn't it?

15:20.875 --> 15:24.041
It's not Bridget's fault
or your fault. It's me. Really.

15:24.041 --> 15:27.875
"It's not you, it's me?"
Are you seriously
using that line on me?

15:27.875 --> 15:29.500
- I'm sorry.
- You can't leave.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.083
I'm not going to make it.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.375
You are going to be fine.

15:35.375 --> 15:39.458
OK? Come on.
Spread those wings and fly.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.208
Hey, we've all been there, man.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.542
Hi.

16:11.375 --> 16:14.542
Hey, Nicole! Welcome back.

16:14.542 --> 16:16.667
Hey, everyone.
You remember Nicole?

16:17.959 --> 16:19.041
Maybe not.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.834
Where's Kristen
and Julie and Thano?

16:21.834 --> 16:23.750
Rehab, Atlantic,
and Kaballah.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.583
You know how the business is.
Changes every day.

16:26.583 --> 16:30.583
- This is Ruby,
Katie, and Moose.
- Moose?

16:30.583 --> 16:33.667
Yeah, I haven't bothered
to learn his real name yet.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.291
So lots of important business
to discuss today.

16:36.291 --> 16:39.542
Especially after what
went down last night in Philly.

16:39.542 --> 16:43.917
- What went down in Philly?
- Trey from
Social Trash freaked.

16:43.917 --> 16:46.750
His dressing room was
red and he only likes pink.

16:46.750 --> 16:50.542
Someone here, Moose, forgot to
put the rider in his contract.

16:50.542 --> 16:54.208
- He wouldn't go
on stage for 90 minutes
- He only likes pink?

16:54.208 --> 16:56.417
It soothes him.

16:56.417 --> 17:01.500
The difference between
a red dressing room and
a pink dressing room is huge.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.917
If we don't get
the big things right,

17:03.917 --> 17:06.208
how are we going
to get little things right?

17:06.208 --> 17:09.542
- [phone ringing]
- Excuse me. It's my nanny.

17:09.542 --> 17:13.792
Jamie? Hi. What?
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

17:13.792 --> 17:16.667
That is great! OK.

17:20.792 --> 17:25.917
It's my daughter, Bella.
She just went on the
exersaucer for the first time.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.041
What the hell's an exersaucer?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.166
- Hello. Hey.
- Hey.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.500
I got your note.
What are you doing?

17:36.500 --> 17:39.500
Gary's out of town, I'm doing
some spackling for him.

17:39.500 --> 17:43.500
No idea who Gary is
or what you're talking about,
but I have great news.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.166
You got rid of the hair dryer?

17:46.375 --> 17:48.000
I'm sorry. Tell me.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.333
I got a job offer
at Thompson Group.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.875
The offer is huge
and the perks are amazing.

17:52.875 --> 17:55.375
Oh, that's great.
Congratulations.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.583
Thank you.

17:56.583 --> 17:59.667
So, I was thinking
about inviting the gang over.

17:59.667 --> 18:04.375
You know, having a dinner party
so we can celebrate everything.
Is that OK?

18:04.375 --> 18:06.542
Sure. We can celebrate
my new job, too.

18:06.542 --> 18:09.500
- You got a job?
- You think I'm
spackling for free?

18:09.500 --> 18:11.250
Are you the handyman now?

18:11.250 --> 18:14.583
Relax. It's just for a month
and we get to live rent free.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.750
See? I told you things
would start coming together.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.417
You sure did.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.917
It's cute that she
wants us all over for dinner.

18:24.917 --> 18:28.834
- It's like she's
domesticating Brian.
- Jimmy hates dinner parties.

18:28.834 --> 18:31.041
I still need a sitter.

18:31.041 --> 18:34.709
Hey, maybe your new manny
boyfriend can come over
and watch the kids.

18:34.709 --> 18:35.875
He's not my boyfriend.

18:38.041 --> 18:43.208
That's enough stalling.
Who would like to start
the discussion of our book?

18:43.208 --> 18:48.792
- It's good. It's really good.
- What? You guys didn't like it?

18:48.792 --> 18:50.917
All right.
The truth is, I didn't read it.

18:50.917 --> 18:53.542
I ordered it online,
but it hasn't gotten here yet.

18:53.542 --> 18:57.250
Just tell us what happened
and we'll have a discussion.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.750
Well...

18:59.750 --> 19:04.417
You didn't read it either?
Wow! Oh, we're such losers!

19:04.417 --> 19:06.041
Who has time to read a book?

19:06.041 --> 19:09.959
I should have just seen
the movie and pretended
to read the book.

19:09.959 --> 19:13.792
That's what we should do.
Start a movie club,
not a book club.

19:13.792 --> 19:17.458
Yeah, but we still
tell the guys it's a book club,

19:17.458 --> 19:22.083
- so they'll leave us alone.
Genius.
- So, what, are we done?

19:22.083 --> 19:26.542
No. We have all
this wine to drink.
We're just getting started.

19:26.542 --> 19:29.291
- To the book club.
- To the book club.

19:31.583 --> 19:34.000
- Hey, buddy.
- Dave.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.417
- What are you doing here?
- Sleeping in your guest room.

19:37.417 --> 19:41.000
- Dave.
- I know you want to be alone
and I get it. OK?

19:41.000 --> 19:44.458
Pretend I'm not here.
It's not Bridget, Brian and me.

19:44.458 --> 19:47.792
We're walking on eggshells. You
do your thing. I do my thing.

19:47.792 --> 19:51.458
It's going to be great.
We're going to have so much fun.
Trust me.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.709
What do we got here?
I saw boob.

19:53.709 --> 19:56.625
I guess celibacy only counts
with two or more, huh?

19:56.625 --> 19:59.375
You dirty dog.
You disgust me.

20:08.291 --> 20:11.458
[loud rock music playing]

20:23.542 --> 20:24.792
[screaming]

20:24.792 --> 20:27.333
- Holy... What the hell?
- What?

20:27.333 --> 20:31.333
What? You can't do that
this early in the morning, dude.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.125
- Do what?
- Where is the coffee?

20:33.125 --> 20:34.625
Too dangerous
when you're naked.

20:34.625 --> 20:38.000
Oh, here's an idea,
dude. Try clothes!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.709
Hey, you know what?

20:39.709 --> 20:44.667
Don't do that!
Hey, sit down. That's good.

20:44.667 --> 20:48.959
Maybe this is time for us
to go over the rules
for our new living situation.

20:48.959 --> 20:53.166
First of all,
eat whatever you want to eat.
My house is your house.

20:53.166 --> 20:55.333
You know I appreciate that.

20:55.333 --> 20:58.041
Second, don't touch the CD
player, stereo or DVD player.

20:58.041 --> 21:01.083
It's just way too complicated.
Same goes for the TiVo.

21:01.083 --> 21:04.709
Don't mess with my season pass.
Just don't touch my stuff.

21:04.709 --> 21:08.500
Wow. I'm confused here.
What happened to,
"My house is your house?"

21:08.500 --> 21:12.208
My house is your house.
I mean, not really.

21:13.583 --> 21:15.709
I'm supposed to be alone,
remember?

21:15.709 --> 21:19.041
- How long you staying?
- I think I'm done.

21:19.041 --> 21:23.375
Why? Is there a problem?
I can be flexible about the
rules, honestly.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.542
You and I? We're buddies, right?

21:26.542 --> 21:30.250
We're friends. We're tight.
I'm going to stay that way. OK?

21:30.250 --> 21:33.250
So I'm going to find a different
situation for myself.

21:34.959 --> 21:37.125
You got a cornflake on your...

21:37.125 --> 21:38.834
Made you look, dude.

21:40.750 --> 21:44.250
Morning. Aren't you
going to be late for work?

21:45.291 --> 21:49.291
I'm not going to work.
I quit yesterday.

21:49.291 --> 21:52.458
- Why?
- I don't know.

21:52.458 --> 21:55.542
Come on. This is me
you're talking to.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.625
I just felt so empty.

21:59.625 --> 22:04.750
I sat there and listened
to people talk about paint
and rock stars and thought,

22:04.750 --> 22:07.542
"This is important?
These people are morons."

22:07.542 --> 22:12.542
- Wow. That was brave of you.
- No, I thought it,
I didn't say it.

22:12.542 --> 22:18.041
Now I'm trying to figure out
what is important in life.

22:18.041 --> 22:21.125
- Because I don't
think it's work.
- For you, it's Bella.

22:21.125 --> 22:24.625
- Well, that's obvious.
- Yeah,
don't take it for granted.

22:24.625 --> 22:26.458
Right now,
you're her whole world.

22:26.458 --> 22:29.291
You mean everything.
That's enough, don't you think?

22:29.291 --> 22:34.000
You're right.
Bella's the only person
that will never let me down.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.625
At least until she turns 16.

22:41.208 --> 22:44.834
- Let's go. Time for our run.
- I can't.
I have too much to do.

22:44.834 --> 22:47.458
- What?
- I'm the new building manager.

22:47.458 --> 22:50.166
- You mean the janitor?
- Building manager.

22:50.166 --> 22:53.792
Go over there and flip
that light switch.
I need to see if I fixed this.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.166
[electrical buzzing]

22:59.166 --> 23:01.500
Ah, well. Just keep up
the good work, Schneider.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.500
Shut up.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.000
Hey, Jimmy.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.208
- Do you know those girls?
- No. I thought you did.

23:10.208 --> 23:12.500
- I'm celibate, remember?
- Oh, right.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.834
Oh, please don't
come over here.

23:35.834 --> 23:38.417
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:38.417 --> 23:42.750
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. Can I help you ladies?

23:42.750 --> 23:45.917
- We're the new tenants. 2B?
- Or not 2B.

23:45.917 --> 23:50.583
- Sure. Right. Well, welcome.
- I am Stephanie. This is Laura.

23:50.583 --> 23:55.291
I'm Brian. I'm the building
manager. It's temporary.

23:55.291 --> 23:59.709
I'm fixing the sconce. [laughs]
Sconce is a funny word.

24:01.375 --> 24:06.583
- And who are you?
- I am Adam. Yep.

24:06.583 --> 24:10.041
I'm going to go for a run.
I'm going to go
for a really long run.

24:10.041 --> 24:14.208
I'm training for a marathon.
What time are we coming
over for dinner?

24:14.208 --> 24:17.166
- I don't know. Eight?
- Yeah? I'll see you then.

24:17.166 --> 24:19.542
- See you.
- So where do you live?

24:19.542 --> 24:23.542
- Right upstairs.
- How convenient for us
if our sink clogs.

24:23.542 --> 24:25.959
Yeah. I got a plunger
and everything.

24:25.959 --> 24:28.917
Do you mind helping us
move some of our stuff in?

24:28.917 --> 24:30.500
- Nope. Not at all.
- Sweet.

24:32.250 --> 24:35.291
- They fell in love,
didn't they?
- Yes, they did.

24:35.291 --> 24:38.959
Good. I like this
kind of story. Go on.

24:38.959 --> 24:41.959
Noah and Allie gave a
remarkably convincing portrayal

24:41.959 --> 24:45.792
of a boy and a girl
traveling down a very long road

24:45.792 --> 24:48.166
with no regard
for the consequences.

24:48.166 --> 24:50.750
I don't know why,
but it makes me feel sad.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.750
I know you feel lost
right now, but don't worry.

24:53.750 --> 24:58.583
Nothing is ever lost
or can be lost. The body is...

24:59.417 --> 25:00.792
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.792
What's up?

25:02.792 --> 25:05.458
Look at you. Watching a movie
in the middle of the afternoon.

25:05.458 --> 25:09.333
- You're not exactly
working hard.
- I came here to see Carrie.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.333
- She's sleeping.
- How she doing?

25:11.333 --> 25:13.625
She's great. She's a trouper.

25:13.625 --> 25:17.917
If anything,
she's super cuddly lately,
so I'm kind of loving it.

25:17.917 --> 25:22.500
I just wish I could do more.
I'm just feeling
totally useless right now.

25:22.500 --> 25:26.875
Well, you're doing
everything you can.
I think you've been amazing.

25:26.875 --> 25:30.583
- Really?
- I couldn't have gotten through
without you.

25:30.583 --> 25:35.417
How come I don't feel that way?
I just feel like
I'm far away or something.

25:35.417 --> 25:38.834
Hey, you want to watch
the end of The Notebook with me?

25:38.834 --> 25:41.792
- That sounds like fun.
- It is.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.500
I got to get back to work.

25:45.125 --> 25:47.875
And, also,
I have to remain a heterosexual.

25:47.875 --> 25:49.750
- Take it.
- OK. Fine.

25:49.750 --> 25:53.291
Thanks for doing this. Although
we could've done it on our own.

25:53.291 --> 25:57.166
- Would've taken four hours.
- Unlike the two it's taken him.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.291
Let me guess,
you're the sarcastic one.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.125
Not normally. But maybe
you just bring it out in me.

26:02.125 --> 26:05.208
- No, she's the sarcastic one.
- So what do you guys do?

26:05.208 --> 26:10.125
The usual. Acting, modeling.
I'm your classic stereotype.

26:10.125 --> 26:13.542
She works all the time and did
this indie movie that's amazing.

26:13.542 --> 26:16.166
- If it gets released.
- What about you?

26:16.166 --> 26:19.208
- I'm sort of a
professional student.
- She's a genius.

26:19.208 --> 26:22.208
I keep going to school
and getting different degrees.

26:22.208 --> 26:25.083
- I figured out
what I want to do.
- What's that?

26:25.083 --> 26:28.250
- She's gonna be a psychologist.
- Don't you have
to go to school?

26:28.250 --> 26:30.208
Yep. I start UCLA on Monday.

26:31.709 --> 26:35.500
- [rock music playing]
- My work's done here.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.542
- Nice.
- Thanks.

26:37.542 --> 26:40.083
Don't go. Have a glass of wine.

26:40.083 --> 26:45.583
No, I can't. All right.
Thanks. To neighbors.

26:45.583 --> 26:49.500
- [rock music plays]
- I love this song!

26:55.709 --> 26:58.083
Brian, you are not leaving now.
Come on.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.709
- Oh, no. I have wine.
- Come on.

27:00.709 --> 27:02.125
Oh, come on.

27:02.917 --> 27:04.709
And, this is weird.

27:11.375 --> 27:12.750
All right.

27:14.250 --> 27:15.709
- Me?
- Yeah!

27:20.709 --> 27:21.709
Brian?

27:24.625 --> 27:27.959
- What the hell
is going on here?
- Hey! This is Stephanie.

27:27.959 --> 27:30.917
- Hi.
- And Laura. Our new neighbors.

27:36.417 --> 27:40.500
Why are you getting so upset?
I was dancing for one second
and then I fell.

27:40.500 --> 27:43.417
I was working the rest of the
time. I swear. Ask the girls.

27:43.417 --> 27:46.375
Just tell me
what you're thinking.

27:46.375 --> 27:49.583
OK, fine. The truth is
I'm not upset about the girls.

27:49.583 --> 27:53.125
I'm upset because no one told me
I was moving in with a handyman!

27:53.125 --> 27:56.458
- Building manager.
- Whatever! I don't like it!

27:56.458 --> 27:59.500
Why didn't you say something?
You seemed OK with it.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.333
I was faking it!

28:01.333 --> 28:04.667
I didn't want you to think
you were moving in with a bitch,

28:04.667 --> 28:06.208
and now I'm living
with Schneider!

28:06.208 --> 28:08.792
You think you've
been tiptoeing?

28:08.792 --> 28:11.834
My face hurts from fake smiling
all day. It's not normal.

28:11.834 --> 28:16.625
You don't think I've
noticed that? What happened
to the guy that I knew?

28:16.625 --> 28:19.792
The motivated, determined,
dressed before noon guy.

28:19.792 --> 28:23.917
This is me. I was never
the real estate guy.
I did it to get out of debt.

28:23.917 --> 28:27.291
Seeing how those people operate
makes me want to run.

28:27.291 --> 28:30.625
I don't want to have anything
to do with that life! Anything!

28:30.625 --> 28:35.166
I'm a part of that life. If you
don't want it, then tell me now.

28:35.166 --> 28:37.875
- That's not what I meant.
- I don't want
to cramp your style.

28:37.875 --> 28:41.625
Your "sleep in, do nothing,
play video games all day" style.

28:41.625 --> 28:45.166
If you wanted some business
mogul, you should've
stayed with my dad.

28:45.166 --> 28:47.166
Hello? Anyone home?

28:48.500 --> 28:52.500
Hey. Just help yourselves.
You know, we'll be right back.

28:53.041 --> 28:54.500
Wow.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.583
How hard is it
to find an assistant?

28:56.583 --> 29:00.750
Wait a second.
One stop before dinner.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.792
What are you doing?
This is Peter Green's office!

29:04.917 --> 29:07.000
I want that Anderson case.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.125
If you see anyone coming,
use a code word to alert me.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.875
What the hell is
the matter with you? Come on!

29:12.875 --> 29:15.417
- The code word is "cereal."
- Stupid.

29:15.417 --> 29:18.375
Peter, give me something
I can use, baby.

29:18.375 --> 29:21.083
Yeah, give me
something I can... Yo.

29:21.083 --> 29:24.333
That's a hideous looking baby.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.375
- Can we go?
- You got to see this baby.

29:26.375 --> 29:28.875
Put the picture down!
Get the hell out of here!

29:30.375 --> 29:34.959
Come on! I'm out of here.
Night, Helen. See you later.

29:34.959 --> 29:37.917
Cereal! Cereal! Quick! Quick!

30:07.875 --> 30:12.750
First the gay bar and now this.
Dude, back off. I'm celibate.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.417
Shut up.

30:28.333 --> 30:30.750
[Adam] I mean,
you should see these girls.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.959
OK, when you say hot,
how hot is hot?

30:32.959 --> 30:34.667
Smoking hot.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.250
Wonder if that's
what they're fighting about.

30:37.250 --> 30:41.166
What, two hotties living
downstairs? Come on.
Ivy would not be happy.

30:41.166 --> 30:43.917
Adam, are those two
coming out any time soon?

30:43.917 --> 30:46.792
Don't know. When's Dave
getting here? He can get them.

30:46.792 --> 30:49.041
He wanted to stay
with the girls.

30:49.041 --> 30:52.792
Geneva has the stomach flu.
She's projectile vomiting.

30:52.792 --> 30:55.959
That's why we're not
having kids.
I cannot deal with the vomit.

30:55.959 --> 30:58.959
Poop, I can deal with.
But puke? Come on. No way.

30:58.959 --> 31:01.750
Hey, you get used to it.
It's natural.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.166
We might have kids one day.

31:03.166 --> 31:07.458
What? No. We agreed that we like
kids, but we don't want kids.

31:07.458 --> 31:10.458
Well, it's a woman's
prerogative to change her mind.

31:10.458 --> 31:12.291
And so I might. Someday.

31:12.291 --> 31:14.709
Really? Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

31:17.208 --> 31:21.000
Well, I should go and call Dave
and see how he's doing.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.417
Wait. Are you staying
at Nicole's tonight?

31:23.417 --> 31:27.500
You're not staying at my house.
There's baby stuff
and the kids are sick.

31:27.500 --> 31:31.291
Relax. No, I'm going
to stay at home. I thought
Dave was staying with you.

31:31.291 --> 31:35.291
He didn't tell you?
He doesn't want to. It's like
he's never seen a man naked.

31:35.291 --> 31:39.417
That's probably
why he came over today.

31:39.417 --> 31:41.041
Huh. I should go.

31:43.458 --> 31:48.000
- See you.
- We are not going out there
until you apologize to me.

31:54.875 --> 31:57.959
OK. Well, I guess we won't be
having any sex any time soon.

31:57.959 --> 32:01.917
- Solve the problem right there.
- You're blowing
this out of proportion.

32:01.917 --> 32:05.041
I never said I wanted kids.
I said we shouldn't rule it out.

32:05.041 --> 32:08.333
- Can you stop eating
for two seconds?
- All right, I'm done.

32:08.333 --> 32:12.041
By the way, you are not Adam.
You couldn't stay
celibate for a day.

32:12.041 --> 32:15.500
We'll see. Don't come
knocking on my door.
Because Little Jimmy?

32:15.500 --> 32:16.834
Not coming out to play.

32:18.041 --> 32:20.375
- Let's get out of here.
- We can't just leave.

32:20.375 --> 32:23.917
Why not? Brian and Bridget
don't seem to care who's here.

32:23.917 --> 32:27.250
- Good point.
- Don't tell me
what I can and can't do.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.667
It's going to be
a frigid bedroom, baby.

32:29.667 --> 32:31.917
Really? I know you
better than you think.

32:31.917 --> 32:35.333
- Hi, is Brian there?
- Hello.
You must be the new neighbors.

32:35.333 --> 32:39.709
- Yeah, Brian told us
to stop by.
- There. Good luck finding him.

32:39.709 --> 32:43.500
Look, I said I was sorry.
We have guests
and you're acting crazy.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.250
You think they didn't
like you before? Just wait.

32:46.250 --> 32:49.166
This is all your fault.
Everyone knows it but you.

32:49.166 --> 32:52.291
- What did I do?
- Nothing. That's the problem.

32:52.291 --> 32:55.542
This is because
I'm the building manager.

32:55.542 --> 32:57.834
You know you should
love me no matter what I do.

32:57.834 --> 33:01.625
I just need you to be there for
me. I need to find my place.

33:01.625 --> 33:04.750
God, this is always about
finding your place, isn't it?

33:04.750 --> 33:08.208
Your place to live,
your place in this world.

33:08.208 --> 33:12.083
This is supposed to be
our place, not yours.

33:12.083 --> 33:15.000
You can't even find
a place for my hair dryer.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.417
It's bigger than my first car.
And that car was huge!

33:20.959 --> 33:23.709
So then you guys broke up?
Just like that?

33:23.709 --> 33:27.625
Yeah. Well, we still
have to file papers,
but, basically, it's over.

33:27.625 --> 33:29.959
That must've been painful.

33:29.959 --> 33:34.208
Just so you know,
I'm not really into talking
about my feelings right now.

33:35.375 --> 33:38.792
And I've taken a vow
of celibacy. No offense.

33:38.792 --> 33:42.417
- [baby crying]
- Excuse me, ladies.
I have to go work.

33:42.417 --> 33:46.458
I think we should go, you know?
Bella's really tired.

33:46.458 --> 33:49.625
Tell Brian and Bridget that
we said bye. Whoever you are.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.125
- Yeah, we should
probably go, too.
- Yeah.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.792
So our first party.
That went well, no?

34:06.792 --> 34:10.166
Well, it seems like you finally
found your place. On the couch.

34:16.667 --> 34:19.583
- [woman on TV]
They fell in love?
- [man on TV] Yes, they did.

34:19.583 --> 34:23.125
Good. I like this
kind of a story. Go on.

34:23.125 --> 34:26.375
[man on TV] Noah and Allie
gave a remarkably
convincing portrayal

34:26.375 --> 34:29.709
of a boy and a girl
traveling down a very long...

34:29.709 --> 34:33.709
You're home early.
Nice dinner party.

34:33.709 --> 34:35.667
Yeah. We skipped
the dinner part.

34:35.667 --> 34:40.000
And the party part. Were you
just watching The Notebook?

34:41.041 --> 34:42.041
No.

34:44.417 --> 34:45.542
Maybe.

34:49.041 --> 34:50.583
Yes, so what?

34:52.542 --> 34:56.917
- How's Geneva?
- Good. Asleep.
Everybody's down.

34:56.917 --> 35:00.500
- Good.
- So I guess I should get going.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.000
Where?

35:03.000 --> 35:06.625
I know that you moved out of
Brian's. And Adam's.

35:06.625 --> 35:09.417
Why didn't you tell me?

35:09.417 --> 35:14.208
Well, you know what?
It just happened, and I
didn't think it was important.

35:14.208 --> 35:17.917
I didn't want you to worry.
I'll figure something out.

35:17.917 --> 35:21.709
I already have figured it out.
You'll stay here.

35:23.166 --> 35:26.417
Don't you think that's
going to be a little confusing?

35:26.417 --> 35:28.083
You know, for the girls.

35:28.083 --> 35:30.542
I'm here tomorrow
then I'm gone the next.

35:30.542 --> 35:34.542
- Who says you have
to be gone the next?
- You want me to move back in?

35:34.542 --> 35:38.166
I'm not saying we should
get back together or anything.

35:38.166 --> 35:43.959
I'm just saying this is your
home and the girls need you.

35:45.542 --> 35:48.542
It's not about us.
It's about them. So...

35:50.709 --> 35:53.417
- Roomies?
- Wow.

35:54.792 --> 35:56.250
Roomies.

35:57.375 --> 35:58.917
[laughs]

36:01.583 --> 36:04.750
- [woman] But it makes me sad.
- It's close to the end.

36:04.750 --> 36:07.291
- [man] I know you
feel lost now...
- Good movie.

36:07.291 --> 36:11.000
- Yeah. God, it's awesome.
- Nothing is ever lost
or can be lost.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.959
Hillman? That your car
out there? With the
Hawkeye bumper sticker?

36:15.959 --> 36:19.792
Yeah. Big Iowa fan.
I hope that's not a problem?

36:19.792 --> 36:22.750
Not if you want to make
partner here. You an alum?

36:22.750 --> 36:25.792
No. My family's from Chicago.
I had cousins who went.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.959
Got me hooked.
I'd take the Big Ten
over the Pac Ten any day.

36:28.959 --> 36:31.583
Hey. Don't dis
my Trojans, now.

36:31.583 --> 36:35.625
Good thing you didn't
admit you were an SC fan
until after you made partner.

36:35.625 --> 36:38.000
I got a deposition.
I want to talk later.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.667
You put a bumper sticker
on that sweet ride of yours?
What's it say?

36:42.667 --> 36:46.625
- Proud to be a Hawkeye.
- You are pathetic!

36:46.625 --> 36:49.000
Or genius. I can smell partner.

36:50.583 --> 36:54.500
Hey, Mr. Hillman.
I have those briefs you
requested.

36:54.500 --> 36:58.834
Thanks, Ben. Just... OK.
Run along. Thank you.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.542
You hired the kid
from the law library?

37:03.542 --> 37:04.959
Yeah, I had no choice.

37:04.959 --> 37:06.792
What? I wasn't going
to hire those women

37:06.792 --> 37:08.959
and I wasn't
going to hire a man,

37:08.959 --> 37:10.875
so I hired Ben. It's perfect.

37:10.875 --> 37:14.041
- You've lost your mind.
- I'm going to make partner.

37:14.041 --> 37:16.041
I liked the
flashback part better

37:16.041 --> 37:19.166
and not because Ryan Gosling
is cuter than James Garner.

37:19.166 --> 37:21.000
Since when do you
wear boxers?

37:21.000 --> 37:26.333
Those are Dave's. Yeah.
He kind of moved back in.

37:26.333 --> 37:27.667
What?

37:27.667 --> 37:29.834
- You guys
getting back together?
- No. No.

37:29.834 --> 37:32.750
What's meant to be is meant
to be. Like the movie.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.917
All right. It is for the kids.
I swear.

37:34.917 --> 37:37.500
You should blame the kids.
Absolutely.

37:37.500 --> 37:41.083
They're going to blame you later
anyway. That's what Jimmy says.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.959
Is that why he
doesn't want kids?

37:42.959 --> 37:46.250
No. Neither of us did when
we got married.

37:46.250 --> 37:49.500
We both decided.

37:49.500 --> 37:53.959
It's OK for things to change,
you know?

37:53.959 --> 37:55.583
For you to feel
differently.

37:55.583 --> 37:58.375
I know.
I saw the movie, too.

37:58.375 --> 38:00.375
I don't know.
Who am I kidding?

38:00.375 --> 38:04.375
I mean, I think I can
raise a kid? I can't even
keep a fern alive.

38:04.375 --> 38:07.542
You never know what you're
capable of until you to do it.

38:07.542 --> 38:10.083
I watched that movie and
I kept thinking about Angelo.

38:10.083 --> 38:15.166
- I'm sorry, honey.
- No. It was a good thing.

38:17.458 --> 38:22.041
After Angelo died, I never
thought I could have feelings
for someone else.

38:22.041 --> 38:24.500
You have feelings
for the manny. I knew it!

38:24.500 --> 38:26.375
- Because he's hot.
- Totally!

38:26.375 --> 38:28.250
I don't have feelings
for anyone, but...

38:28.250 --> 38:32.500
No, the point is,
I'm ready to.

38:32.500 --> 38:35.583
I think I'm ready
to fall in love again.

38:35.583 --> 38:38.542
- Well, I think that's great.
- So do I.

38:38.542 --> 38:42.709
Next week, we are so
watching The Sound of Music.

38:42.709 --> 38:45.458
Because the captain falls
in love with the baby-sitter.

38:47.417 --> 38:51.583
OK, here we go. This is it.
This is my favorite scene.

38:51.583 --> 38:56.291
It was us. It was us.
It was us.

38:56.291 --> 38:59.583
I don't know. This is
not better than Old School.

38:59.583 --> 39:02.500
- Some of us are trying
to watch it.
- Sorry.

39:03.792 --> 39:04.792
[woman] Noah.

39:08.125 --> 39:10.667
Dude, I can't believe
you don't like this.

39:10.667 --> 39:13.959
It's a girl deciding
between two guys.

39:13.959 --> 39:18.458
This is the story of your life.
You're still mad
because I moved out?

39:18.458 --> 39:22.583
- Stranding me, yeah.
- You got to appreciate
what you have

39:22.583 --> 39:25.625
before you wind up with
Alzheimer's like in the movie.

39:25.625 --> 39:29.208
You don't remember anything.
It's part of being
in a relationship.

39:29.208 --> 39:31.083
You work through things.

39:31.083 --> 39:34.083
You know, some things
just don't work out.
Look at you and Deena.

39:34.083 --> 39:36.166
Actually, I moved back in.

39:38.375 --> 39:42.208
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
I mean, it's for the girls.

39:42.208 --> 39:44.959
We're not getting
back together or anything,

39:44.959 --> 39:49.000
but I got to tell you, man.
I can't help but thinking,
you know, maybe...

39:49.000 --> 39:52.667
I mean, it's the
beginning of something.
Something better between us.

39:52.667 --> 39:56.000
Bridget and I
aren't you and Deena.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.041
You know,
we don't have that thing.

40:00.041 --> 40:03.083
I don't know if we're
meant to be together or not.

40:03.083 --> 40:05.458
You could be. You know?

40:05.458 --> 40:09.125
I mean, you can't let
what your dad did mess
with your head, you know?

40:09.125 --> 40:13.834
Not everybody is going
to screw you. Not everybody
is going to take off.

40:13.834 --> 40:18.709
If you want her there, let her
be there. Let her know. Right?

40:23.542 --> 40:24.917
I love this part.

40:34.417 --> 40:36.583
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.542
Is this for my hair dryer?

40:40.542 --> 40:44.875
It's for my stuff.
You can have the
whole counter for yours.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.000
You don't have
to do that, Brian.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.917
Yeah, I do. I'm happy
you're here, Bridget.
I really am.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.750
This is our place now, and I
want you to feel like it is.

40:57.583 --> 40:58.583
Come here.

41:07.166 --> 41:10.250
Seeing as you're going
to be fixing things around here,

41:10.250 --> 41:12.709
I figured I'd
get you some tools.

41:13.875 --> 41:16.083
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

41:16.083 --> 41:19.917
You know I'm not going
be a Schneider forever, right?
It's way too much work.

41:28.917 --> 41:29.917
Jamie?

41:35.500 --> 41:36.500
Jamie?

41:39.083 --> 41:40.458
Oh, my God.

41:40.458 --> 41:45.250
Uh... Bella puked all over me,

41:45.250 --> 41:49.959
and the sound of water
lulled her to sleep
in her bouncy seat,

41:49.959 --> 41:55.250
so I decided to take advantage
of the situation and wash off.

41:56.834 --> 41:59.625
- How are you?
- Good.

41:59.625 --> 42:02.959
I should probably get dressed.

42:02.959 --> 42:06.166
Yes. Go... Of course. I...

42:06.166 --> 42:10.542
♪ What I've been waiting ♪

42:10.542 --> 42:16.542
♪ This is what I've
been waiting ♪♪
