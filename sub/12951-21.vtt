WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.835
Previously on "Alias"...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.870
We've decrypted
the specs on Helix.

00:04.871 --> 00:08.329
Data describes a breakthrough
in molecular gene therapy.

00:08.441 --> 00:09.942
It refers to a procedure

00:09.943 --> 00:11.943
whereby a patient's
face and body

00:11.945 --> 00:14.470
are reshaped to
resemble someone else.

00:15.148 --> 00:18.447
I've been asked to confirm
that you are in position.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.985
Yes.

00:19.986 --> 00:22.853
Everything's in place.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

00:41.474 --> 00:43.609
I went shopping,
and I saw something.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.110
It reminded me of you.

00:46.579 --> 00:49.079
You bought Vaughn a present?

00:49.082 --> 00:51.283
Sydney's saying
you're wearing suits.

00:51.284 --> 00:54.253
I thought you could
always use a new tie.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.853
It's beautiful. Thank you.
That's very sweet.

00:57.924 --> 01:00.424
You're welcome.

01:08.635 --> 01:10.803
- I couldn't take it.
- Me either.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.704
I thought I was losing my mind.

01:12.705 --> 01:16.698
Me too. That was the longest
debrief in history.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.779
I was staring at you
the whole time. Did you notice?

01:19.846 --> 01:22.346
Yeah.

01:24.050 --> 01:25.717
I think my dad noticed, too.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.153
No, he didn't notice.

01:28.154 --> 01:32.386
Why do you think he assigned
you the investigation?

01:32.459 --> 01:34.760
Because it's a big job.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.128
A big deal.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.629
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:39.799 --> 01:43.030
Someone unauthorized
accessed our computer systems.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.137
I'm gonna find them.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.372
I'm the point guy.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.873
You're the point guy?

01:49.876 --> 01:52.376
I'm the point guy.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.283
Where are Will and Francie?

01:58.284 --> 02:00.946
Out. They won't
be back for hours.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.021
You're so beautiful.

02:03.022 --> 02:05.257
Will Tippin
may be compromised.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.292
Our superiors deal in absolutes.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.026
Either he is or he's not.

02:09.027 --> 02:11.463
The CIA is on
a mole hunt to find out

02:11.464 --> 02:14.661
who accessed the defense
satellite communications system.

02:14.734 --> 02:18.966
It's a matter of time before
they trace it to Tippin and me.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.839
Sloane will want Tippin killed

02:20.840 --> 02:22.774
before the CIA interrogates.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.743
Sloane's gone.
Perhaps for good.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.545
We can't wait for his return.

02:26.546 --> 02:29.046
If the CIA uses regression
therapy to find out

02:29.082 --> 02:31.083
who he's been leaking
information to,

02:31.084 --> 02:33.552
our Los Angeles asset
will be compromised.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.078
I don't want Tippin killed.

02:37.757 --> 02:41.249
I have a meeting with someone
who can help us re-acquire

02:41.327 --> 02:42.661
the Di Regno heart.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.097
He'll get us plans
to the NSA facility

02:45.098 --> 02:47.466
where they keep
the Rambaldi artifacts.

02:47.467 --> 02:48.567
In the meantime,

02:48.568 --> 02:53.198
tell our asset Tippin's frame
needs to be convincing.

02:55.241 --> 02:57.543
Tomorrow you'll be
asked questions

02:57.544 --> 02:59.711
that only Will Tippin
can answer.

02:59.712 --> 03:02.772
Places you've been,
things you've said and done.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.977
You'll remember some things
and forget others.

03:06.052 --> 03:09.988
The more personal the questions,
the less you will recall.

03:11.257 --> 03:14.624
In fact, the more
you try to recall details,

03:14.694 --> 03:17.129
the more elusive they'll become.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.031
Do you understand?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.699
Yes.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.868
Now listen carefully.

03:22.869 --> 03:26.396
Do not move.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.084
I'm not supposed to
tell you this.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.319
What?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.588
It's supposed to
go through channels.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.623
What?
Oh, it's bad, isn't it?

03:44.624 --> 03:46.491
An operation based
on my analysis

03:46.492 --> 03:47.926
went historically wrong.

03:47.927 --> 03:51.294
You passed the upper-level
analyst test you took last week.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.799
- I did?
- With one of the highest marks.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.634
- Congratulations.
- You know what this means?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.638
I heard that Roberts
is retiring.

03:59.639 --> 04:00.572
I know.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.341
There's a spot for an analyst.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.902
Which you're now qualified for.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.714
- Hands up!
- Hands in the air.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.916
What's going on?
Who are you?

04:10.917 --> 04:13.118
FBI. Mr. Tippin,
you are under arrest.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.953
- Arrest?
- Who approved this?

04:14.954 --> 04:17.221
Agent Bristow,
do not interfere.

04:17.223 --> 04:20.659
Tippin's being detained
on suspicion of espionage.

04:20.726 --> 04:21.827
Espionage?

04:21.827 --> 04:24.456
Don't say anything
until you hear from me!

04:25.231 --> 04:26.465
Who ordered this?

04:26.466 --> 04:28.966
Your father.

04:32.639 --> 04:35.007
This is insane.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.508
Will is not a traitor.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.777
Over the last month,
we've had two breaches

04:38.778 --> 04:41.278
of our satellite
communications systems.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.805
The first disabled coverage,
allowing Derevko to escape.

04:44.884 --> 04:48.012
The second was a download
of our imaging archives.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.954
Specifically the raid
on Sloane's villa in Tuscany.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.458
There's no way Will
is working for Sloane.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.926
Syd. Excuse me.

04:54.927 --> 04:58.260
Sorry. When I ran
a diagnostic on the network,

04:58.331 --> 05:01.391
Will's account was active
in two places simultaneously.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.769
A glitch which has
since been corrected.

05:03.770 --> 05:07.297
Satellite footage was accessed
from one of those accounts.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.775
Anyone could have
logged on with his I.D.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.510
Or he did it himself.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.708
I have known Will for years.
Trust me on this.

05:14.781 --> 05:16.882
There's another possibility.

05:16.883 --> 05:21.445
That the man we have in
custody is not Will Tippin.

05:21.521 --> 05:22.888
Project Helix.

05:22.889 --> 05:25.290
The doubling prototype
that you destroyed

05:25.291 --> 05:27.919
was designed to reshape
physical attributes

05:27.994 --> 05:30.554
to identically
resemble someone else.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.030
The prototype's database

05:32.031 --> 05:34.829
revealed two scheduled
recipients of the procedure.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.401
Dr. Renzo Markovic,
who was killed,

05:37.437 --> 05:39.937
and a second,
unknown individual.

05:39.939 --> 05:42.439
You think Will
is the other double.

05:42.508 --> 05:46.000
We found Provacillium
in Will's car.

05:46.112 --> 05:49.138
It's a medication taken
by gene-therapy patients

05:49.215 --> 05:51.877
to keep the body from
rejecting DNA mutations.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.152
What about giving him
an ocular scan?

05:54.153 --> 05:57.554
That's a really good point,
Mr. Vaughn... Michael...

05:57.623 --> 05:59.558
I probably shouldn't
call you...

05:59.559 --> 06:02.221
Uh, an ocular scan
is often used...

06:02.295 --> 06:04.923
Tippin's being transferred
to Medical Services.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.989
They'll scan him and have
the results shortly.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.567
But there's something else.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.230
A digital recording was found
among Tippin's things.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.641
It was taken
by the surveillance equipment

06:16.642 --> 06:19.509
you found in your apartment
several months ago.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.328
- They think I'm not me?
- They don't know.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.105
Someone breached the system.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.240
They disabled
all Wi-Fi access points

07:22.241 --> 07:23.909
and reset all user accounts.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.143
It's a witch hunt.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.179
What was that eye scan?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.448
It's a test.
It analyzes your retina.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.384
Someone who's been doubled
develops proteins.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.952
They're like markers.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.690
They found proteins.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.293
Syd, that's impossible.
It doesn't make any sense.

07:48.334 --> 07:51.826
Wait a second. I was assigned
to do research on Markovic.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.438
This must be a setup.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.741
Go in my office.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.506
Everything I've been
working on is there.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.240
I'm innocent.
You know that, right?

08:08.788 --> 08:12.815
Do you remember that time
when we had too much to drink?

08:14.026 --> 08:16.526
The night we kissed?

08:16.863 --> 08:17.863
It was amazing.

08:17.864 --> 08:20.364
Of course I remember.
In your apartment.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.958
Do you remember where
it was in my apartment?

08:23.035 --> 08:25.535
What room?

08:34.679 --> 08:37.179
It's a small apartment.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.683
No, I know.
Of course. It was, um...

08:41.821 --> 08:44.517
We were eating.

08:44.590 --> 08:47.090
It was in the kitchen.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.164
Syd.

08:53.165 --> 08:56.032
I spilled
something on your sweater.

08:58.571 --> 09:01.071
Do you remember what that was?

09:05.578 --> 09:08.078
Syd.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.450
I swear it's me.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.484
Pull Tippin's phone records,
E- mails. Get his financials.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.525
Going over the record could
lead us to his handler.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.793
Or exonerate him.

09:54.794 --> 09:58.195
He couldn't answer your
questions. Look at the evidence.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.824
I have reasonable doubt.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.134
The information
Tippin fed Sloane

10:03.135 --> 10:05.635
led directly to Diane's death.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.973
Excuse me.

10:12.044 --> 10:14.112
If someone wanted
to set Will up,

10:14.113 --> 10:16.147
this is exactly
what they would do.

10:16.148 --> 10:19.481
Plant these clues.
Condition him.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.180
I'd like to assign Francie
a protective detail.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.950
If Sloane is targeting friends,
she could be next.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.224
Done.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.819
I'd also like to speak
with her about Will.

10:28.894 --> 10:31.454
She might have information
that could help.

10:31.530 --> 10:34.030
Tell her whatever
you think is necessary.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.533
Only what's necessary.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.038
I need to know if he's
been acting strangely.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.108
What's wrong?

10:43.109 --> 10:45.669
Forgetting things.
Saying things Will wouldn't.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.406
What? Where is he?
Is he okay?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.981
Just think about it.

11:01.227 --> 11:04.287
He has been distant lately.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.165
For how long?

11:07.166 --> 11:11.193
Since the two weeks he spent
in Chicago with his family.

11:13.639 --> 11:16.139
Sydney, what's going on?

11:17.777 --> 11:21.235
There are gonna be
some men outside in a van.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.549
They're security.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.678
They're gonna be watching
the apartment, watching you.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.122
Protecting you.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.625
Why?

11:33.626 --> 11:36.390
Syd, you're creeping me out.

11:41.967 --> 11:44.467
I don't work for a bank.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.705
We downloaded intel
from Tippin's computer

11:48.808 --> 11:51.276
on work he was doing
to locate the second double.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.777
He managed to identify
the man who invented

11:53.879 --> 11:58.077
the computer-imaging equipment
used by Dr. Markovic.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.652
This is Dr. Hans Jurgens.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.721
He's a chief scientist
at Miracorps.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.418
The largest hospital supply
company in the European Union.

12:05.491 --> 12:08.756
His equipment was used
during the gene therapy

12:08.828 --> 12:11.262
required to complete
the doubling process.

12:11.263 --> 12:14.755
A controlling assumption is
that he was personally involved.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.359
We think he knows the identity
of the second double?

12:17.470 --> 12:19.437
If the guy we've got
isn't Tippin,

12:19.438 --> 12:21.005
we can't trust his intel.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.341
At best, it's a dead end.
At worst, it's a trap.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.842
I think it's him.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.378
I'm getting bored
with your hunches.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.549
Pardon me.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.983
We move the prisoner to
Camp Harris for interrogation.

12:37.056 --> 12:39.157
I'm not letting
my friend be taken.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.493
We can't keep letting your
daughter's relationships...

12:41.494 --> 12:44.054
Will's not trained
to handle torture.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.463
He'll say anything.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.332
He's not innocent!

12:47.333 --> 12:50.131
For now, Tippin stays here!

12:52.905 --> 12:55.106
Five hours ago
we acquired surveillance

12:55.107 --> 12:57.607
of Jurgens in Berlin.

12:58.077 --> 13:00.145
Contact in-country will meet you

13:00.146 --> 13:02.413
at Bendix office
building downtown,

13:02.414 --> 13:05.110
then brief you
on the operation.

13:05.184 --> 13:07.684
Your plane leaves
in half an hour.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.006
- Man, I'm so...
- Stop.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.821
That's what they recovered
from my wife's car

13:43.889 --> 13:46.389
after the bomb went off.

13:47.993 --> 13:52.930
That's why we couldn't have
an open-casket funeral for her.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.801
Turn the page.

14:00.706 --> 14:05.268
The first fingerprint
is your right index finger.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.545
The second is
the partial they lifted

14:07.546 --> 14:11.277
from the remote detonator
we found among your things.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.018
The prints are a match.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.689
You have Sydney fooled,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.991
but I'm not gonna
play games with you.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.492
You are not Will Tippin.

14:21.493 --> 14:22.827
You can't think that...

14:22.828 --> 14:24.829
Help me find Arvin Sloane,

14:24.830 --> 14:27.492
and I will help you avoid
the death penalty.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.160
- You have to believe me.
- Refuse to cooperate,

14:30.236 --> 14:33.000
and I assure you,
you will suffer.

14:33.105 --> 14:35.630
Now, when you're done
with this act,

14:35.741 --> 14:38.142
you will tell me
what I want to know!

14:38.143 --> 14:40.643
I'll prove it to you.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.718
How did we meet?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.219
Sydney introduced us.

14:50.789 --> 14:51.990
Where?

14:51.991 --> 14:55.392
It was, um...
She had a party.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.996
And there was
a bunch of us together.

15:04.670 --> 15:09.130
And, uh, I remember
what we were talking about.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.411
Dixon, somebody did this to me.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.912
I can't remember.

15:28.193 --> 15:30.753
You murdered my wife.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.991
You murdered my wife.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.738
You murdered...

16:18.544 --> 16:21.044
Dixon.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.147
Tippin's being
transferred to Camp Harris.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.249
I want you to supervise.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.912
Director Bristow decided
he's not to be moved.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.421
He's been overruled by D.O.J.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.922
Convoy leaves in 10 minutes.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.692
She what?

16:34.693 --> 16:38.993
Bristow broke her cover with me.
She told me she's CIA.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.965
Did she give you an explanation?

16:40.966 --> 16:42.767
Given what's happening,

16:42.768 --> 16:45.862
she was concerned for
my safety, of all things

16:46.405 --> 16:48.106
Bristow's willingness
to confide in you

16:48.107 --> 16:49.407
is an advantageous development

16:49.408 --> 16:51.209
that will be lost
if Tippin gives you up.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.710
I intercepted
a D.O.J. transmission.

16:53.779 --> 16:56.279
They're moving Tippin
to a secure location.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.616
Once he's there,
he will be unreachable.

16:58.617 --> 17:01.916
Organize a team to intercept
the transport and extract him.

17:01.987 --> 17:04.580
To the CIA, this will
confirm his value to us.

17:04.656 --> 17:07.156
And once we have him?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.527
Kill him.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.546
Have you tried
the restaurant upstairs?

17:34.620 --> 17:37.748
Yes. The bratwurst is excellent.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.757
Hello, my friends.

17:39.758 --> 17:43.159
We've tracked Jurgens to
a local sex club he frequents.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.163
Leather, whips, latex, chains.
All the good stuff.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.533
How long's he gonna be there?

17:48.534 --> 17:50.535
Could be a couple hours.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.036
I say we move in now.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.240
- What?
- Nothing.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.343
# I #

17:59.344 --> 18:01.844
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:05.350 --> 18:06.350
# I #

18:06.351 --> 18:08.876
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:08.954 --> 18:09.954
# I #

18:09.955 --> 18:12.356
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:12.357 --> 18:13.458
# I #

18:13.459 --> 18:15.893
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:15.894 --> 18:16.894
# I #

18:16.895 --> 18:19.395
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:19.431 --> 18:20.765
# I #

18:20.766 --> 18:23.067
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:23.068 --> 18:24.168
# I #

18:24.169 --> 18:26.571
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:26.572 --> 18:27.705
# I #

18:27.706 --> 18:30.206
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:30.209 --> 18:31.309
# I #

18:31.310 --> 18:33.644
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:33.645 --> 18:35.012
# I #

18:35.013 --> 18:37.315
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:37.316 --> 18:38.382
# I #

18:38.383 --> 18:40.251
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:40.252 --> 18:42.186
I'm glad I'm not in leather.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.687
You'd look cute in a teddy.

18:45.724 --> 18:48.591
Jurgens is with his security
team against the wall.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.595
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

18:51.663 --> 18:52.697
# I #

18:52.698 --> 18:55.292
# I wanna, mmm, mmm, I #

20:10.309 --> 20:11.709
Hello, honey.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.977
Hello, dear.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.445
Who is he?

20:14.446 --> 20:16.214
Your wife's name is Alba.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.449
How do you know my wife?

20:18.450 --> 20:20.950
Oh, no!

20:21.253 --> 20:22.486
Hi, Alba.

20:22.487 --> 20:23.621
Oh, please.

20:27.693 --> 20:31.493
We know about Project Helix.
That you built it for Markovic.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.496
You do?

20:32.497 --> 20:35.796
We know he used it to double
himself and one other person.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.001
With Markovic dead,

20:37.002 --> 20:39.502
you're the only one
who knows that second agent.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.405
But I do not know.

20:41.406 --> 20:45.240
I assume your wife's e-mail
address is still the same.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.278
She's gonna love these pictures.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.580
No, no.
No, no, wait!

20:49.581 --> 20:51.482
I just built it for Markovic.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.651
I was not there
for the procedure.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.786
Your wife is gonna
love these pictures

20:55.787 --> 20:57.955
to add to your scrapbook.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.657
I do not know the name.

20:59.658 --> 21:02.456
But there is a way
you can find it.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.929
The computing power required

21:04.930 --> 21:08.161
to model a person's entire
genome is tremendous.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.601
So during the doubling process,

21:10.602 --> 21:12.803
Markovic had to be connected

21:12.804 --> 21:15.432
to an off-site
computer facility.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.008
A server farm.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.509
If you access those servers,

21:18.510 --> 21:20.978
you can find the identity
of the second double.

21:20.979 --> 21:23.914
- Which server farm did he use?
- I do not know.

21:23.982 --> 21:26.482
I swear to God!

21:26.785 --> 21:29.481
Please do not send
those pictures.

21:30.656 --> 21:33.181
Please let me go.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.259
Please let me go!

21:35.260 --> 21:36.827
Here's your pictures.

21:36.828 --> 21:39.328
Please!

21:39.431 --> 21:41.931
Give me back my pants.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.773
Please explain
this transfer order.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.610
Tippin is stonewalling.

21:52.611 --> 21:53.544
We need to break him

21:53.545 --> 21:55.446
before his handlers realize
he's been compromised.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.947
Unrestricted interrogation
is premature.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.917
Justice department didn't agree.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.418
Tippin is a threat
to national security.

22:02.421 --> 22:05.515
Which means they want to
be consulted on every decision

22:05.590 --> 22:06.857
of this investigation.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.159
What did you think?

22:08.160 --> 22:11.596
That I just forged the transfer
order on CIA letterhead?

22:11.663 --> 22:13.831
You went behind my back.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.630
Hardly unheard of
in this office.

22:16.702 --> 22:18.436
So what is this?

22:18.437 --> 22:22.100
Retribution for me
taking your parking space?

22:22.207 --> 22:25.734
No, I do what my job compels
me to do. Nothing less.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.312
If you can't see that
I'm trying to protect

22:28.313 --> 22:29.980
everyone in this operation,

22:29.981 --> 22:32.779
then I overestimated
your intelligence.

22:55.974 --> 22:59.740
That was Roosevelt Road.
E.T.A.... 20 minutes.

22:59.811 --> 23:02.311
Copy that.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.057
Shots fired!

23:25.704 --> 23:27.772
We got a sniper!

23:37.616 --> 23:40.116
Move out! Move out!

24:21.226 --> 24:22.993
Wait a second.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.196
Come on!

24:25.197 --> 24:27.697
Move it!

24:40.645 --> 24:43.145
Tippin!

25:14.446 --> 25:16.113
You son of a bitch.

25:16.114 --> 25:17.515
You transferred Will

25:17.516 --> 25:19.416
after we agreed to
keep him here.

25:19.417 --> 25:22.682
Hey, your father may be
my superior, but I am yours.

25:22.754 --> 25:24.288
Who do you think you are?

25:24.289 --> 25:25.623
My friend may be dead.

25:25.624 --> 25:29.492
Your friend arranged for a team
to facilitate his escape.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.996
From a cell?
He didn't get a phone call.

25:31.997 --> 25:33.464
Syd, I was there.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.965
I saw him. He fired
into the transport.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.801
It wasn't self-defense?

25:37.802 --> 25:40.302
Would you excuse us, please?

25:44.109 --> 25:47.203
I know it's not smart
to lose my cool with Kendall.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.246
You have to accept
the possibility

25:49.247 --> 25:53.013
that the man we had in custody
was not your friend.

25:53.084 --> 25:56.417
Dad, I don't believe it.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.988
I understand.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.853
'Cause if it wasn't Will...

26:05.597 --> 26:08.122
...then Will
is most likely dead.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.734
And I can't handle that.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.563
We received your intel
from Berlin.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.174
We're analyzing the list
of server farms.

26:18.243 --> 26:21.804
As soon as we have a lead
on the facility, you'll know.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.043
Go home.
Get some rest.

26:38.763 --> 26:43.132
I have to admit I was surprised
when I was contacted.

26:43.201 --> 26:45.636
The plans, please.

26:45.637 --> 26:48.606
What surprised me
is you wanting blueprints

26:48.707 --> 26:51.075
to a government
storage facility.

26:51.076 --> 26:55.012
Rumor being that you're
working with CIA now.

26:58.883 --> 27:00.217
Do me a favor.

27:00.218 --> 27:02.718
Let me know how
you plan on doing it.

27:02.754 --> 27:03.921
Doing what?

27:03.922 --> 27:07.255
Getting past the new
access control system.

27:07.325 --> 27:10.055
Because unless you know
how to crack it,

27:10.128 --> 27:14.155
these blueprints
won't do you any good.

27:15.433 --> 27:18.027
Oh, I just can't believe it.

27:18.103 --> 27:20.204
It seems so insane.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.705
I know.

27:22.707 --> 27:24.608
I mean, how is it even possible

27:24.609 --> 27:26.610
that someone could
look like Will

27:26.611 --> 27:29.111
and sound like him?

27:29.114 --> 27:32.379
I mean, it's just so ridiculous.

27:35.553 --> 27:39.546
Does the CIA have any idea
where Will might be?

27:39.624 --> 27:42.124
I mean, the real Will?

27:45.296 --> 27:47.796
I'm sorry.

27:48.533 --> 27:52.299
But I'm not authorized
to give you any details.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.238
Syd, don't do this to me.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.607
- Francie.
- Sydney, you're my best friend.

27:56.608 --> 27:59.577
You told me that you're a spy,
my boyfriend's a double,

27:59.644 --> 28:02.112
and now you're telling me
you're not authorized?

28:02.113 --> 28:04.613
The answer is we don't know.

28:15.727 --> 28:16.894
Hello?

28:16.895 --> 28:18.862
Syd, it's me.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.363
Will, where are you?

28:22.033 --> 28:24.034
I didn't escape.
A team hit the bus.

28:24.035 --> 28:27.095
They tried to take me, kill me.
Someone's framing me.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.800
The FBI and CIA both have you
on a shoot-to-kill watch list.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.810
You have to tell me
where you are.

28:32.811 --> 28:35.974
So Kendall can send me
to Camp Harris like a terrorist?

28:36.047 --> 28:37.614
Not a chance.

28:37.615 --> 28:39.349
I won't let that happen.

28:39.350 --> 28:42.251
If you are Will, you know
I will do whatever it takes

28:42.320 --> 28:45.289
to make sure
that nothing happens to you.

28:46.491 --> 28:49.051
Please let me bring you in.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.067
Syd, I love you.

28:58.603 --> 29:01.103
I can't trust you.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.673
Not anymore.

29:05.043 --> 29:08.137
Meeting you destroyed my life.

29:10.048 --> 29:12.548
You want to help me?

29:12.617 --> 29:14.718
Prove I'm innocent.

29:14.719 --> 29:18.155
There may be a DNA record
of the surgical procedure.

29:18.223 --> 29:20.723
It could clear you.

29:21.326 --> 29:24.318
It's on a server farm
somewhere in Europe.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.563
I'm gonna find it.

29:28.633 --> 29:31.133
I promise.

29:31.236 --> 29:32.269
Okay.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.604
This may be nothing,

29:33.605 --> 29:36.665
but Markovic laundered money
through real estate.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.742
He had a farm in Marseilles.

29:38.743 --> 29:41.974
Maybe it's not a cow-pig farm.
Maybe it's a server farm.

29:42.046 --> 29:44.214
Marseilles?
Do you remember where?

29:44.215 --> 29:45.949
No. No.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.450
I gotta go.
I gotta go.

29:53.825 --> 29:57.022
Syd, where is he?
Is he okay?

29:57.862 --> 29:59.129
I have to go.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.894
No. Talk to me.
Tell me what's happening.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.466
I can't.
I'm sorry.

30:09.841 --> 30:12.341
Please try to understand.

30:19.450 --> 30:21.852
Sydney Bristow's
headed to Marseilles?

30:21.853 --> 30:23.520
Should I follow her?

30:23.521 --> 30:24.755
Stay there.

30:24.756 --> 30:27.452
Finding Tippin
is your priority.

30:34.866 --> 30:36.700
How did it go?

30:36.701 --> 30:38.435
The NSA facility uses

30:38.436 --> 30:40.537
state-of-the-art
locking mechanisms.

30:40.538 --> 30:43.038
We've bypassed systems
like that before.

30:43.141 --> 30:46.577
The access codes I downloaded
from the CIA Echelon system

30:46.678 --> 30:47.911
won't work anymore.

30:47.912 --> 30:52.815
The NSA now uses
a time-synchronized key card.

30:56.688 --> 31:00.215
Presumably a CIA agent
under the proper duress

31:00.291 --> 31:02.791
could obtain such a key card.

31:03.962 --> 31:08.023
I'm about to confess something
that will either delight you...

31:08.099 --> 31:10.863
which I hope is the case,
that would be nice...

31:10.935 --> 31:13.237
or it will make you furious.

31:13.238 --> 31:16.002
While you were away, Will Tippin
was ordered to Camp Harris

31:16.107 --> 31:18.974
for unrestricted interrogation.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.910
They would have found out
about our asset.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.313
What did you do?

31:23.314 --> 31:26.545
I instructed that he be
extracted and killed.

31:26.618 --> 31:30.714
I told you
I didn't want him killed.

31:30.788 --> 31:33.552
Your asset could have been
pulled from the field.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.719
Yes, I know.
But the situation had changed.

31:36.794 --> 31:39.029
Sydney, out of fear
for Francie's life,

31:39.030 --> 31:43.228
told her she was going to
Marseilles to clear Tippin.

31:43.301 --> 31:45.035
Is he dead?

31:45.036 --> 31:46.737
No.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.872
He's at large.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.501
And believed to have escaped.

31:51.609 --> 31:55.045
Which should provide us
leverage to get into the NSA.

31:55.113 --> 31:58.207
If we recover the evidence
in Marseilles before Sydney,

31:58.283 --> 32:00.183
we can force her hand.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.948
Proof of Will's innocence
in exchange for her aid

32:03.021 --> 32:04.922
in securing a key card.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.924
We got the forensics report

32:06.925 --> 32:09.326
on the detonator we found
among Tippin's things.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.261
Will's fingerprint
was placed on the trigger

32:11.262 --> 32:13.762
after it was wiped down.

32:14.732 --> 32:18.327
Great. We have evidence that
confirms he was being framed.

32:18.403 --> 32:22.806
It'll take hours to get Justice
approval to infiltrate the farm.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.642
Take Vaughn.

32:25.643 --> 32:28.373
The two of you
will go in tactically.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.814
I'll have Marshall
prepare your op-tech.

32:30.815 --> 32:32.482
Kendall's gonna report you.

32:32.483 --> 32:34.851
I'm aware of the consequences.

32:34.852 --> 32:37.514
When the D.O.J. hears
you initiated an op...

32:37.588 --> 32:40.421
Sydney, I've been doing
this longer than you have.

32:40.491 --> 32:43.756
I'm not cut out
for management, anyway.

33:04.882 --> 33:06.817
We need to talk.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.051
Yes, I know.

33:08.052 --> 33:10.020
I've been sanctioned
by the D.O.J.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.289
I'm no larger in charge
of this operation center.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.857
That honor goes to you.

33:13.858 --> 33:16.691
Maybe I'm a slow learner.
I don't understand you.

33:16.761 --> 33:20.595
You maneuvered me out of my job,
and now you're handing it back.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.165
I belong in the field.

33:24.702 --> 33:27.933
We can help each other.
We don't have to be adversaries.

33:28.039 --> 33:30.507
I appreciate your magnanimity.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.676
Now you're just mocking me.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.112
Yes.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.638
Part of the reason
I sent Tippin to Camp Harris

33:37.715 --> 33:40.183
was to protect Sydney.

33:40.184 --> 33:43.085
Why do you think
you have your job back?

33:51.095 --> 33:52.295
Thanks, Mr. Bristow.

33:52.296 --> 33:54.796
Thanks, Sarah.
Keep the change.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.020
It's good to see you, Jack.

34:17.021 --> 34:20.217
I assume that since you're
sitting across from me

34:20.291 --> 34:23.123
with so little regard
for your life,

34:23.194 --> 34:26.027
I'm in the cross hairs
of a sniper rifle.

34:26.097 --> 34:27.864
Two of them.

34:27.864 --> 34:30.364
Of course.

34:31.168 --> 34:33.763
I've missed your poker face.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.842
So.

34:39.844 --> 34:43.746
There's something
I want you to know.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.315
I forgive you.

34:45.315 --> 34:47.117
Excuse me?

34:47.118 --> 34:49.618
Your betrayal of SD-6.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.621
I'm curious, Jack.

34:52.857 --> 34:55.917
When exactly did
our friendship end?

34:57.628 --> 35:00.961
The moment you recruited
Sydney over my objection.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.224
Ahh. I thought so.

35:05.570 --> 35:09.506
If I had known that decision
would cost me our friendship

35:09.574 --> 35:12.074
and my relationship
with Sydney,

35:12.176 --> 35:14.838
I would have done
things differently.

35:14.912 --> 35:17.047
Self-pity doesn't become you.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.710
Jack, on the contrary.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.514
I'm here to make you an offer.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.821
I don't expect an answer now.

35:24.822 --> 35:27.290
What would that be?

35:27.291 --> 35:30.260
Come back to
our partnership, Jack.

35:31.329 --> 35:34.787
I will tell you everything
I've learned about Rambaldi.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.892
An obsession I've never shared.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.469
Well, now's the time to sign up.

35:40.571 --> 35:42.739
For years, I collected
his artifacts.

35:42.740 --> 35:45.041
As if that was the point.

35:45.042 --> 35:49.274
I thought Rambaldi's work
was the window to the past.

35:49.347 --> 35:54.614
Today, I am one move away
from proving to you

35:54.685 --> 35:57.449
that it is so much
more than that.

35:58.356 --> 36:03.089
And this time, Sydney won't
be a pawn in our venture.

36:03.861 --> 36:06.361
Jack, sit here for a while.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.864
Think about it.

36:09.967 --> 36:14.233
We will never work
together again.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.541
The thing of it is,

36:19.644 --> 36:22.144
you are going to work with me.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.680
Sooner than you think.

36:27.385 --> 36:29.486
The men who have you
in their sights

36:29.487 --> 36:31.621
have been instructed to
put a bullet through your brain

36:31.622 --> 36:35.922
if you dial your cell or leave
this table within 30 minutes.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.423
We'll see each
other again, Jack.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.203
Trust me on that.

37:03.854 --> 37:05.956
The chief of security
holds a kill switch

37:05.957 --> 37:08.325
that enables him to
wipe clean their data storage

37:08.326 --> 37:09.626
at any sign of attack.

37:09.627 --> 37:12.221
To prevent the destruction
of the information,

37:12.296 --> 37:15.891
I will proceed to the security
room and secure the kill switch.

37:15.967 --> 37:19.232
After confirmation, you'll
expedite through the facility.

37:19.337 --> 37:21.438
You'll consider
everyone hostile.

37:21.439 --> 37:24.602
We'll upload the file on
the second double to a server.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.209
Any questions?

37:27.578 --> 37:30.078
Agent Bristow.

37:37.555 --> 37:40.217
# Yeah, yeah #

37:40.291 --> 37:42.791
# Yeah, yeah #

38:06.117 --> 38:07.751
Hey.

38:07.752 --> 38:10.120
What is this?
A private club?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.554
Un Americain.

38:11.555 --> 38:14.854
What? Is this Paris?

38:14.925 --> 38:15.925
Come on, can I...

38:15.926 --> 38:18.554
Hey, monsieur.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:18.629 --> 38:21.129
Look, I had a little
too much to drink.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.533
It's not a big deal.
Is this the fancy club...

38:26.837 --> 38:30.000
Oh, I love you, man.
I love...

38:30.107 --> 38:32.701
- Can I come in?
- No, no, no, no.

38:32.810 --> 38:35.506
Now, I know I've had
a little too much to drink,

38:35.579 --> 38:38.571
but I really just want to
come in for a little bit.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.984
I hear it's...
my friends told me to come.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.086
Come on.
I love you, man.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.157
Oh, come on.
Let me just...

38:47.158 --> 38:49.626
I just want to go
inside the club.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.563
Listen, I love you, man.

38:53.564 --> 38:56.064
No, no, no, no.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.902
I just...
Please. Look, please.

38:58.903 --> 39:00.103
I love you, man.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.204
Hey!

39:02.773 --> 39:04.841
Okay, okay. Okay.

39:04.842 --> 39:05.942
Tout de suite.

39:05.943 --> 39:08.443
All right.
You're so grumpy.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.312
What's your status,
Mountaineer?

39:50.388 --> 39:51.688
I'm going in.

39:51.689 --> 39:54.189
Copy. We'll move in.

40:10.207 --> 40:14.109
Boy Scout in position. All teams
hold for Mountaineer's signal.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.548
Hello, Sydney.

40:54.385 --> 40:55.718
Help!
- Sydney!

40:58.989 --> 41:00.824
I know what you're after.

41:00.825 --> 41:03.385
Your friend's suspected
of being a double.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.760
You believe these servers
could clear him.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.331
No, don't...

41:09.767 --> 41:12.267
Go, go, go!

41:29.787 --> 41:31.821
You erased it.

41:31.822 --> 41:34.484
I transferred a copy
to a secure location.

41:34.558 --> 41:38.392
I'll give it to you.
In exchange, you do something.

41:38.462 --> 41:40.897
Go to hell.

41:40.898 --> 41:43.799
If you don't, you'll
never clear Will's name.

41:43.868 --> 41:46.928
He'll be tried as
a traitor and executed.

41:48.072 --> 41:51.166
I'll be calling
on you soon, Sydney.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.150
Thanks for coming.

42:34.151 --> 42:36.252
- You okay?
- Yeah.

42:36.253 --> 42:38.753
Yeah, I am now.
