00:05.377 --> 00:11.327
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

00:13.417 --> 00:16.170
That creature is us.

00:17.817 --> 00:24.006
All over the world, we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

00:24.057 --> 00:29.654
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

00:31.297 --> 00:34.414
This is the Human Planet.

00:50.497 --> 00:53.250
In all the wild places on Earth,

00:53.297 --> 00:57.051
we have risen to the challenges
nature has thrown at us.

01:00.857 --> 01:05.089
Now we have created
the habitat of our dreams.

01:06.657 --> 01:10.013
Designed by us, for us.

01:12.697 --> 01:17.566
The pinnacle of human imagination
and ingenuity.

01:18.937 --> 01:22.771
This is where we humans
like to think we reign supreme,

01:24.817 --> 01:27.729
driving out
the nature we don't want...

01:29.297 --> 01:30.969
Oh, God!

01:31.017 --> 01:32.689
...shipping in what we do.

01:36.577 --> 01:40.126
But the natural world
isn't easy to control.

01:43.737 --> 01:48.288
Can we humans ever really
master nature in the urban jungle?

01:48.337 --> 01:51.409
And is it wise to try?

02:10.217 --> 02:13.653
Dubai is the ultimate modern city...

02:15.817 --> 02:19.366
...orderly, sparkling and squeaky clean.

02:21.457 --> 02:26.087
It's a temple to man's ingenuity,
rising from the desert.

02:32.297 --> 02:35.494
But there's a menace in the air.

02:36.817 --> 02:38.250
Pigeons.

02:39.777 --> 02:44.487
Thousands of them are making a mess
in this pristine metropolis,

02:44.537 --> 02:47.335
and Dubai doesn't like it.

02:49.577 --> 02:51.807
One man can help.

02:54.377 --> 02:57.449
The Arabs call him Al Hurr.

02:57.497 --> 03:00.330
His name is David Stead.

03:00.377 --> 03:02.845
Good lad.

03:09.497 --> 03:13.809
His challenge
is to keep Dubai pigeon free

03:13.857 --> 03:17.372
using falcons -
an ancient Arabian solution

03:17.417 --> 03:20.090
for a modern urban problem.

03:24.457 --> 03:26.175
Birds of prey, of course,
are hunting birds.

03:26.217 --> 03:28.970
And the falcons,
in the bird of prey family,

03:29.017 --> 03:31.531
are the specialist bird-hunters.

03:31.577 --> 03:34.410
They only catch other birds
for a living.

03:34.457 --> 03:38.336
And, as a result, the pigeons
are most scared of falcons,

03:38.377 --> 03:41.096
compared to any of the other
birds of prey. So, even a pigeon

03:41.137 --> 03:46.655
that has never seen a falcon in its life
does have this almost genetic fear

03:46.697 --> 03:50.576
of the silhouette - the shape -
of a falcon.

03:57.337 --> 04:01.296
Today, he is working for
some of Dubai's top hotels

04:01.337 --> 04:05.489
with his peregrine falcon Nimr.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.449
Nimr is
a three-year-old falcon now.

04:09.497 --> 04:11.328
They become adult at one.

04:11.377 --> 04:14.130
So she's now quite a mature falcon

04:14.177 --> 04:17.169
although, at three,
she still has an awful lot to learn.

04:18.377 --> 04:22.893
Out of the whole team,
she's probably the most arrogant.

04:22.937 --> 04:25.212
She has this tremendous
attitude about her

04:25.257 --> 04:29.045
and she knows who's in charge.
And, I can assure you, it's not us.

04:31.217 --> 04:35.051
City pigeons damage these buildings.

04:35.097 --> 04:38.533
Their corrosive droppings
erode chrome and stone,

04:38.577 --> 04:43.605
and each bird can produce
1 2 kilos of mess a year.

04:51.377 --> 04:55.450
But David's aim isn't to kill
or even catch them.

04:57.057 --> 05:00.094
He is hoping to scare them away.

05:00.137 --> 05:02.128
And Nimr loves the chase.

05:02.177 --> 05:05.408
After all, she's a peregrine -

05:05.457 --> 05:07.846
the fastest creature in the sky,

05:07.897 --> 05:10.969
capable of swooping
at 280 kilometres an hour.

05:15.817 --> 05:20.971
So, once she's moved them on,
he needs to tempt her back.

05:21.017 --> 05:22.496
And that's tricky.

05:24.417 --> 05:27.454
She's an extremely
inquisitive falcon,

05:27.497 --> 05:30.330
which can be frustrating for me,
because I tend to lose

05:30.377 --> 05:32.447
all contact and control with her

05:32.497 --> 05:35.807
when she's flying
and she sees something amusing.

05:39.937 --> 05:44.965
But there's always
one way to a falcon's heart -

05:45.017 --> 05:46.735
the promise of a chicken dinner.

05:53.217 --> 05:59.565
Thanks to David and Nimr,
Dubai's hotels remain pigeon free.

06:05.897 --> 06:11.176
After all, no-one wants pigeon poo
to spoil their million-dollar view.

06:13.897 --> 06:17.412
Sometimes, driving unwanted wildlife
out of a town

06:17.457 --> 06:20.654
requires a much more modern solution.

06:28.617 --> 06:32.007
Sergeant Stan Schumaker is on a mission.

06:38.017 --> 06:41.009
He works in Estes Park, Colorado.

06:42.937 --> 06:48.534
Every day he patrols his patch
on an unusual police vehicle -

06:48.577 --> 06:50.807
a Segway scooter.

06:55.617 --> 06:59.735
His job is to keep the streets
free of trouble.

06:59.777 --> 07:04.453
And trouble here
is particularly large and spiky.

07:13.177 --> 07:18.046
Once the elk come in, getting around
town's a hassle, pretty much

07:18.097 --> 07:21.373
from June to the beginning of October.

07:21.417 --> 07:25.092
Every summer,
the town is invaded by elk stags.

07:25.137 --> 07:28.812
Sergeant Schumaker's job
is to make sure that the locals

07:28.857 --> 07:31.007
can go about their daily business.

07:31.057 --> 07:33.696
Not easy at this time of year.

07:33.737 --> 07:35.455
They may look placid,

07:35.497 --> 07:39.206
but elk weigh over 300 kilos,
can be three metres tall

07:39.257 --> 07:42.055
and their antlers are lethal.

07:44.257 --> 07:45.895
They're pretty much
everywhere in town.

07:45.937 --> 07:49.691
This whole valley is pretty much
full of elk. At any given time,

07:49.737 --> 07:54.094
there could be anywhere
from 500 to 1,500.

07:54.137 --> 07:58.096
The female elk
love the urban grasslands.

07:58.137 --> 08:01.766
They live here year round.

08:01.817 --> 08:04.126
We've got two main golf courses.

08:04.177 --> 08:08.136
The grass is, of course, golf grass,
so they absolutely love that.

08:08.177 --> 08:10.532
The male elk are only visiting.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.410
And it's not for golf.

08:14.457 --> 08:18.052
The boys are back in town for one thing -

08:18.097 --> 08:20.247
a stag party.

08:24.817 --> 08:26.853
At this time of year,

08:26.897 --> 08:30.253
the stags fight over the females
and can be very dangerous.

08:34.537 --> 08:37.927
But it's not just the elk
causing problems.

08:37.977 --> 08:42.175
Sergeant Schumaker
also has to control the tourists.

08:42.217 --> 08:46.529
A lot of these tourists have no idea
that these animals are wild.

08:46.577 --> 08:48.852
It's the craziest thing, but they...

08:48.897 --> 08:51.286
For some reason
they think these animals are tame.

09:04.737 --> 09:08.412
There's no messing
with an irritable elk.

09:09.457 --> 09:11.368
Get back, guys.

09:20.617 --> 09:24.212
In the Wild West of the 21st century,

09:24.257 --> 09:28.967
the sheriffs white stallion
has been replaced by a giant scooter.

09:29.017 --> 09:32.373
The elk do not like the Segway.
I don't know what it is.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.009
I think it's the movement,

09:34.057 --> 09:37.447
because I'm not moving normal,
as a human would walk.

09:37.497 --> 09:41.126
And I'm scurrying around
a lot quicker on that Segway.

09:41.177 --> 09:43.486
So the elk do not like it whatsoever.

09:45.057 --> 09:47.969
Today's been a good day
for Sergeant Schumaker.

09:48.017 --> 09:50.736
He's run the troublemakers out of town.

09:53.217 --> 09:59.656
But not all the invaders who come
to our cities are so easy to chase away.

10:01.857 --> 10:04.735
Some cities are plagued by creatures

10:04.777 --> 10:08.213
who are just as wily
and streetwise as us.

10:09.737 --> 10:14.128
Jaipur, one of the fastest growing cities
in India.

10:14.177 --> 10:18.614
Here, muggings and petty theft
are part of everyday life.

10:18.657 --> 10:24.732
Shakuntla, a local market seller,
is terrorised by street gangs.

10:24.777 --> 10:26.733
And these are not the local lads.

10:44.897 --> 10:48.048
She has to face them every day.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.490
They're a terrifying bunch.

10:59.497 --> 11:03.046
A posse of rhesus macaques
hang out on the rooftops.

11:04.777 --> 11:08.895
One bite from these canines
can inflict horrible damage.

11:22.017 --> 11:27.296
For the macaques,
life in the urban jungle is even easier

11:27.337 --> 11:28.895
than life in the real one.

11:36.257 --> 11:39.533
Like us, they can be smart and slick.

11:50.017 --> 11:55.887
Jaipur's temples and streets
provide endless pockets to pick.

11:55.937 --> 12:00.408
And their favourite place
is the food market.

12:02.217 --> 12:05.607
The question today is,
will Shakuntla's stall

12:05.657 --> 12:08.490
survive all the monkey business?

12:18.497 --> 12:23.491
The attack is led by the gang leader,
an alpha male.

12:33.577 --> 12:37.092
The macaques
work as a co-ordinated team,

12:37.137 --> 12:38.570
ducking and diving.

12:42.697 --> 12:44.016
Attacking from all angles,

12:44.057 --> 12:47.606
the smaller macaques distract Shakuntla,

12:47.657 --> 12:51.411
while the bolder males grab the loot.

13:10.297 --> 13:13.767
Life on Jaipur's streets is tough enough.

13:13.817 --> 13:18.527
But when your enemy is protected by
a deity, there's nothing you can do.

13:18.577 --> 13:22.695
These monkeys are sacred
to the monkey god Hanuman.

13:38.537 --> 13:41.609
Monkeys can be a menace in the market.

13:41.657 --> 13:47.766
But there is a wider war going on
under all our city streets.

13:54.457 --> 13:57.688
Some species have become
a threat to our domination

13:57.737 --> 14:01.127
of our very own urban world.

14:01.177 --> 14:05.295
Jeff and Junior are on a stakeout,

14:05.337 --> 14:09.967
hunting down mortal enemies
on the Manhattan front line.

14:10.017 --> 14:13.566
My job is a night-time exterminator
in New York City.

14:15.057 --> 14:17.651
Day-time guys where I work do bedbugs.

14:17.697 --> 14:21.292
We just do rats, mice,
roaches in restaurants.

14:21.337 --> 14:24.534
What sort of time do you think
we'll be getting up in this place?

14:24.577 --> 14:27.933
I don't know. They said about midnight.

14:27.977 --> 14:30.047
They're not closed yet.

14:30.097 --> 14:33.055
I mean, I don't really have
a problem telling people what I do,

14:33.097 --> 14:36.692
but we try to be as discreet as possible,
just because I don't want people

14:36.737 --> 14:39.615
to think that they're eating
in an area that's full of rats.

14:39.657 --> 14:43.411
But East Village is full of them,
so you can't hide that.

14:43.457 --> 14:45.971
Rats love fine dining too.

14:46.017 --> 14:48.212
But they don't leave tips behind.

14:48.257 --> 14:52.136
They leave excrement and disease.

14:52.177 --> 14:56.375
No-one wants to admit that
the Big Apple has a big rat problem,

14:56.417 --> 14:59.375
so Jeff and Junior only work at night.

14:59.417 --> 15:01.408
Trash is a big deal.

15:01.457 --> 15:05.245
Us being sloppy humans
throwing trash out on the sidewalks,

15:05.297 --> 15:08.209
and leaving the juices and meat juices
and chicken bones everywhere.

15:08.257 --> 15:11.454
That's a buffet for them,
you know what I mean?

15:11.497 --> 15:14.773
Tonight,
they're laying traps in Chinatown.

15:14.817 --> 15:16.216
Wow!

15:17.937 --> 15:19.768
Are you OK?

15:19.817 --> 15:22.695
Another one of these, man.

15:22.737 --> 15:25.205
Another one of these. Wow.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.693
How do you even
leave your restaurant like this?

15:28.737 --> 15:31.251
Oh, man! Dude, look at this.

15:31.297 --> 15:36.166
Look at all of this stuff!
Sushi, rice, noodles.

15:37.737 --> 15:43.573
HURT.. Rats will eat anything, from
chop suey to the chopsticks themselves.

15:43.617 --> 15:45.733
We walk in at night
because we have keys.

15:45.777 --> 15:47.847
We have to go
when the customers are gone.

15:47.897 --> 15:52.175
And when the people leave the restaurant,
the rats think it's time to come out.

15:52.217 --> 15:55.971
But we go in there later, like an hour
after they close, so they're out partying.

15:56.017 --> 15:57.973
Uh-oh. There he is, there he is,
there he is. Right there, right there.

15:58.017 --> 16:00.736
Right there, right there,
right there, right there. See him?

16:00.777 --> 16:04.372
Shh! Shh! He's going down, he's going
down. Right there. Right in the hole.

16:05.537 --> 16:07.016
Damn!

16:07.057 --> 16:09.617
- He was drinking coffee.
- Something.

16:09.657 --> 16:12.455
That's the last thing
that this guy needs is coffee.

16:14.017 --> 16:15.245
Unbelievable!

16:15.297 --> 16:18.130
- That's why I don't eat takeout, man.
- Yes, you do.

16:19.697 --> 16:21.574
Come on. Let's go to the basement, man.

16:23.657 --> 16:25.295
Watch out, man. It's slippery.

16:28.017 --> 16:30.372
And there's another horror
in the basement.

16:30.417 --> 16:34.729
Yo! Look at the bugs in the ceiling!
You don't ever see that.

16:34.777 --> 16:35.926
Right there behind the door.

16:35.977 --> 16:38.696
Cockroaches.

16:38.737 --> 16:40.250
- This is professional extermination.
- I got these bugs.

16:42.097 --> 16:44.611
- Oh! Have you seen this basement?
- What's in there, man?

16:44.657 --> 16:48.127
Old buildings
connected by pipes and basements

16:48.177 --> 16:52.534
allow the rats and roaches
to scuttle through the city unseen.

16:52.577 --> 16:55.091
It's disgusting in here. Look at the water
dripping all over the place.

16:55.137 --> 16:57.890
We're basically
trying to be quiet to hear noises

16:57.937 --> 17:00.690
for any, you know,
any signs of rat activities.

17:00.737 --> 17:03.410
You hear that? You hear that?
The little pitter-patter?

17:05.057 --> 17:06.729
Little fingernails?

17:06.777 --> 17:09.245
Yup. Over here.

17:11.097 --> 17:15.136
Look at that. That goes right into the...
I can see the kitchen!

17:17.217 --> 17:20.015
For Jeff and Junior
it's a lifelong fight.

17:20.057 --> 17:24.096
It's said there's at least one rat
for every person in New York.

17:24.137 --> 17:26.128
That's nearly nine million rats.

17:27.617 --> 17:32.930
As far as humans winning
the battle over rats - nowhere close.

17:32.977 --> 17:35.889
I don't even know how you would stop it,
I really don't.

17:37.297 --> 17:40.016
They are going to use
every contraption they can devise

17:40.057 --> 17:42.252
in the battle with the pests.

17:42.297 --> 17:45.255
- Well, this is a...
- I don't want to call them out, but...

17:45.297 --> 17:47.765
Listen to that.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.809
All those people out there, they have
no idea what's happening down here.

17:50.857 --> 17:52.688
And they're
going to come eat here tomorrow.

17:52.737 --> 17:54.887
50% off all day, huh?

17:56.057 --> 17:59.845
Yeah... Yeah, no wonder.

18:06.337 --> 18:12.367
24 hours later, Jeff and Junior
are back to assess the death toll.

18:12.417 --> 18:13.645
Ah, dude.

18:16.577 --> 18:18.693
The snap traps have worked.

18:20.537 --> 18:22.175
He's cute.

18:22.217 --> 18:24.412
And the glue mats.

18:24.457 --> 18:27.494
This one is decomposing.

18:27.537 --> 18:29.175
And the poison.

18:29.217 --> 18:31.367
Oh, dude!

18:31.417 --> 18:34.250
- Look at the size of him!
- He's dead.

18:34.297 --> 18:38.370
Looks like he's been
fighting with something, bro.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.533
Damn! Look at them teeth, bro. Whoa!

18:40.577 --> 18:43.853
- Whoa!
- What's the weight on that?

18:43.897 --> 18:46.855
I'm telling you, man. My arm got tired.
That's pretty... That's brutal.

18:46.897 --> 18:48.330
Oh, man!

18:48.377 --> 18:53.735
This is just another night in the ongoing
battle with our eternal enemies.

18:54.777 --> 18:58.053
Sometimes we'll walk out
with bags of dead things

18:58.097 --> 19:00.930
and I'll take a takeout bag
from the restaurant

19:00.977 --> 19:04.287
so people would think I'm leaving
with takeout food.

19:20.937 --> 19:23.849
And it gets worse.

19:24.297 --> 19:28.256
There are other tiny creatures
which take advantage

19:28.297 --> 19:30.447
of dense urban populations.

19:32.177 --> 19:36.489
They exploit us
in much more intimate ways.

19:37.537 --> 19:40.290
They're reaching epidemic proportions.

19:41.577 --> 19:44.011
Not just feeding off us like rats,

19:44.057 --> 19:46.855
but literally feeding on us.

19:48.417 --> 19:52.126
Londoner Carol Anderson
has these unwanted house guests.

19:52.177 --> 19:54.372
Have you got any bites on you
at the moment?

19:54.417 --> 19:55.896
You mean these?

19:57.377 --> 19:59.572
Yeah,
the bites that you had all round here.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.847
There's still little red marks from them,
aren't there?

20:04.097 --> 20:06.770
Where do you think they are
in your room?

20:06.817 --> 20:08.569
Down the side of the bed.

20:08.617 --> 20:12.451
- That's what I meant.
- And crawling up the walls.

20:14.017 --> 20:18.010
Irritating parasites
which only come out at night.

20:19.097 --> 20:21.292
Right. Right. Come on, then.

20:21.337 --> 20:24.295
In you go. Hop up.

20:24.337 --> 20:27.568
That's it, then. Good night,
sleep tight, don't let the...?

20:27.617 --> 20:30.131
Bedbugs bite.

20:30.177 --> 20:31.405
Let's hope not.

20:39.217 --> 20:46.532
Bedbugs are insect vampires attracted
to carbon dioxide, heat and body odours.

20:49.577 --> 20:52.933
They like clean, warm houses.

21:03.017 --> 21:06.327
Their only food is human blood.

21:07.377 --> 21:12.246
The sheer numbers
is quite daunting, really.

21:12.297 --> 21:16.085
They literally were streaming up the wall,
up to the ceiling, just full of blood.

21:16.137 --> 21:18.093
So they'd obviously
all just been feeding.

21:18.137 --> 21:20.446
First thing in the morning,
I woke up and looked up.

21:20.497 --> 21:22.965
It was horrible, it really was horrible.

21:28.617 --> 21:32.007
Carol calls in the best bedbug detector
in the business...

21:33.697 --> 21:37.292
...Charlie the chocolate Labrador,

21:37.337 --> 21:40.488
ably assisted by his handler, Adam.

21:46.297 --> 21:52.611
Right. Well, the sofa seems to be the
worst affected. Got lots of bugs in here.

21:52.657 --> 21:57.173
Charlie's nose is 44 times
more sensitive than ours.

21:57.217 --> 21:59.526
He can literally
sniff out the bedbugs.

21:59.577 --> 22:01.374
Seek.

22:07.937 --> 22:12.089
If they are present,
he's trained to sit down.

22:13.937 --> 22:15.609
Good boy, Charlie.

22:15.657 --> 22:18.569
It's all Adam needs to know.

22:23.897 --> 22:26.127
Bedbugs are on the increase,

22:26.177 --> 22:29.135
hitchhiking
as we travel from city to city,

22:29.177 --> 22:32.533
often infesting furniture
like Carol's sofa.

22:35.137 --> 22:38.254
I do resent them,
but I quite admire them as well.

22:38.297 --> 22:41.209
They're actually quite amazing,

22:41.257 --> 22:43.817
which makes it even creepier,
you know, because...

22:43.857 --> 22:45.927
that's what I'm up against.

22:48.817 --> 22:52.253
But with Adam's spray and Charlie's nose,

22:52.297 --> 22:55.369
the bugs here have met their match.

22:55.417 --> 22:59.808
This is one urban intruder
nobody wants to live with.

23:08.257 --> 23:11.329
In some parts of the world,
people have learned

23:11.377 --> 23:14.369
to put their urban invaders to good use.

23:16.937 --> 23:20.452
The Moroccan city of Fez,
a bit like Dubai,

23:20.497 --> 23:22.727
has a problem with pigeons.

23:24.777 --> 23:30.170
But rather than chasing them away,
the people of Fez invite them in.

23:35.137 --> 23:38.493
Nordine has built
a home for pigeons on his roof.

23:58.457 --> 24:01.051
He doesn't do this
just for the love of animals.

24:01.097 --> 24:04.089
Pigeon droppings
are vital to a local industry.

24:06.577 --> 24:10.729
And Nordine's friend Tami
has come to buy some.

24:28.177 --> 24:31.374
Tami works at the local tannery.

24:31.417 --> 24:35.376
Fez is the centre
of the Moroccan leather industry.

24:41.017 --> 24:44.089
The leather here
is famed for its softness,

24:44.137 --> 24:47.209
and the pigeon droppings
are a secret ingredient.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.050
Wild pigeon droppings

24:57.097 --> 25:00.328
contain an enzyme
which eats at the protein

25:00.377 --> 25:03.050
in the animal skin, softening it up.

25:04.777 --> 25:08.486
The hides are soaked
in the vats for three days,

25:08.537 --> 25:11.176
and Tami works them with his feet.

25:12.217 --> 25:16.210
This could be
the stinkiest job in the world.

25:27.297 --> 25:30.334
For Tami, it's a price worth paying.

25:30.377 --> 25:33.335
The pigeon droppings
give the skins a softness

25:33.377 --> 25:36.608
no man-made chemical can produce.

26:07.417 --> 26:09.851
Thanks to Fez's wild pigeons,

26:09.897 --> 26:13.412
the skins will reach
the highest possible price.

26:19.257 --> 26:25.605
Another very different city
is also working with an urban intruder.

26:35.737 --> 26:41.972
Sometimes even the most unlikely species
can turn out to be good news.

26:45.577 --> 26:46.646
Austin, Texas,

26:46.697 --> 26:52.374
is now home
to 1.5 million free-tail bats and, today,

26:52.417 --> 26:54.885
they are very welcome here.

26:59.017 --> 27:03.852
20 years ago they set up home
on this bridge in downtown Austin,

27:03.897 --> 27:06.855
and the residents
wanted to get rid of them.

27:10.057 --> 27:14.016
River boatman Captain Mike
remembers it well.

27:15.857 --> 27:16.846
They're already taking off.

27:16.897 --> 27:19.047
Look over the tree tops
along the right-hand side.

27:19.097 --> 27:20.928
They are off and running.

27:20.977 --> 27:25.255
There was a fair amount of people
that were actually afraid of the bats

27:25.297 --> 27:28.255
because they were afraid
we were going to have a rabies problem

27:28.297 --> 27:29.730
or a disease outbreak,

27:29.777 --> 27:33.406
so there were actually groups of people
lobbying the city council

27:33.457 --> 27:38.485
and business leaders to figure out
a way to exterminate the colony.

27:41.097 --> 27:44.612
But bats turned out
to be helpful for the city.

27:44.657 --> 27:49.572
The 24-hour urban lifestyle
means that Austin is a city of light,

27:49.617 --> 27:52.609
and that attracts millions of insects,

27:52.657 --> 27:56.650
which are, in turn, fast food for bats.

28:00.897 --> 28:05.493
Every night,
the bats eat six tonnes of insects.

28:05.537 --> 28:08.734
That's an incredible
2,000 tonnes a year.

28:11.617 --> 28:14.927
However,
they're more than just bug-killers.

28:14.977 --> 28:18.572
Captain Mike saw bats
as a commercial opportunity.

28:20.137 --> 28:23.925
I started doing bat-watching cruises
shortly after they moved in here,

28:23.977 --> 28:26.491
and word spread and they started
getting more and more popular.

28:26.537 --> 28:31.088
So we do those seven nights a week
during the season, from March to October.

28:32.137 --> 28:34.287
Bats have really helped me
in my business, so I love them.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.567
If you look up underneath the bridge,

28:36.617 --> 28:38.369
you will watch them
drop out of these cracks here.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.772
Visitors
who come to see the bats

28:40.817 --> 28:45.095
generate $ 1 0 million
in tourist revenue every year.

28:45.137 --> 28:50.495
So the free-tail bats
of the state capital are now protected.

29:01.457 --> 29:05.530
It turns out we still want
to be connected to nature,

29:05.577 --> 29:08.489
and perhaps we always have.

29:13.497 --> 29:19.049
In India, one group of people take caring
for animals to the ultimate extreme,

29:19.097 --> 29:22.612
and they've been
doing it for centuries.

29:26.737 --> 29:30.446
Shyam Sunder
has rescued a chinkara gazelle

29:30.497 --> 29:33.648
on the outskirts of his town in Rajasthan.

29:36.777 --> 29:38.256
Her mother has been killed.

29:38.297 --> 29:41.289
Without milk,
the fawn will not survive,

29:41.337 --> 29:44.534
so Shyam is taking her home.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.127
They're calling her Arti,

30:14.177 --> 30:18.329
and a spot of sandalwood
honours her arrival.

30:21.137 --> 30:26.291
Kyran, Shyam's wife,
has cared for many gazelles.

30:37.297 --> 30:44.453
The Sunders belong to a Hindu sect
of nature worshippers called the Bishnoi.

30:44.497 --> 30:47.136
Shyam supplies milk
to the Bishnoi temple,

30:47.177 --> 30:49.407
which has its own orphans to care for.

30:52.457 --> 30:55.767
The Bishnoi
were India's first environmentalists

30:55.817 --> 31:00.845
and have brought their traditions from
the country into the towns and cities.

31:03.697 --> 31:07.531
It is their belief that
gazelles are their children

31:07.577 --> 31:12.253
and so the Bishnoi women
show an incredible act of kindness.

31:12.297 --> 31:15.528
They breast-feed the fawns
that don't take to the bottle.

31:28.257 --> 31:31.727
Even for gazelles, breast is best.

31:57.177 --> 32:01.853
After six weeks with her new family,
Arti is weaned.

32:23.817 --> 32:26.729
She's now fit and healthy.

32:26.777 --> 32:30.053
Shyam can take her back to the wild.

32:33.857 --> 32:37.088
Watching a child leave home
is always tough for a mum,

32:37.137 --> 32:39.093
even a surrogate one.

32:41.937 --> 32:47.455
Arti is returned to the desert,
where she'll join up with the wild herds.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.686
This may appear to be
a tiny gesture of kindness,

32:55.737 --> 33:00.606
but all of us who live in cities
need the nature that exists

33:00.657 --> 33:02.568
beyond the city walls...

33:09.057 --> 33:13.608
...because the natural world
feeds our hungry cities.

33:18.497 --> 33:24.174
And what the urban jungle needs,
the urban jungle gets.

33:26.257 --> 33:31.285
More than three billion of us
now live in cities.

33:34.817 --> 33:36.853
To feed this huge population,

33:36.897 --> 33:42.608
we ship in billions of tonnes
of fresh food and produce all year round.

33:45.457 --> 33:49.245
We have the technology
to bring in what we want

33:49.297 --> 33:51.128
from thousands of kilometres away.

33:56.137 --> 33:58.890
Peaches may grow here in Spain,

33:58.937 --> 34:02.976
but these
are imported from South America.

34:10.017 --> 34:13.487
We consume what we want,
when we want it.

34:19.617 --> 34:22.848
We no longer need to eat locally
or seasonally.

34:28.777 --> 34:32.133
And we have an insatiable appetite.

34:36.777 --> 34:40.531
We've never been so good
at exploiting nature.

34:40.577 --> 34:45.605
But we're not quite so good
at dealing with the consequences.

34:49.457 --> 34:53.848
Massive consumption
creates mountains of waste.

34:59.777 --> 35:05.454
In the UKalone, we produce over
1 00 million tonnes of rubbish each year.

35:07.057 --> 35:10.732
And we dump it safely out of sight.

35:13.097 --> 35:18.854
But in some places, this world is home
to an unfortunate few.

35:29.897 --> 35:31.853
Here in Mombasa, Kenya,

35:31.897 --> 35:37.415
people must scratch a living
from the things others throw away.

35:42.937 --> 35:47.727
For Ashe and her family, this dump
is both home and hunting ground.

35:49.297 --> 35:55.247
They are modern-day hunter-gatherers,
adapted to survival on the dark side

35:55.297 --> 35:57.765
of the urban jungle.

36:40.937 --> 36:46.250
When a rubbish truck arrives,
the race is on to grab the best scraps.

37:11.137 --> 37:15.016
Ashe's husband, Ali, gets stuck in.

37:20.737 --> 37:24.730
This really is life on the edge...

37:26.897 --> 37:31.448
...finding food for your children
in a city's rubbish.

37:41.777 --> 37:45.895
More than half of us now live in cities.

37:45.937 --> 37:50.010
And we're using up nature's resources
as never before.

37:55.137 --> 37:58.209
We are, without doubt,
the most inventive

37:58.257 --> 38:00.566
and powerful creature on the planet.

38:04.977 --> 38:10.574
We're so successful, we've hijacked
the whole world for our own ends.

38:15.937 --> 38:21.694
But the consequences of our voracious
lives are spiralling out of control.

38:24.857 --> 38:29.453
Are we pushing the natural world
towards a crisis?

38:32.817 --> 38:35.411
Where do we go from here?

38:44.137 --> 38:48.688
There are a few people who seem to be
heading in a new direction.

38:52.697 --> 38:57.691
One challenge is to design a city
that's in balance with nature.

38:59.017 --> 39:06.446
This is Masdar, a green city
being built in the desert of Abu Dhabi.

39:06.497 --> 39:10.410
It's designed by architect Norman Foster.

39:12.217 --> 39:18.690
Masdar excites me because
it's really the only true experiment

39:18.737 --> 39:25.051
on the planet, at the moment, in terms
of seeking to achieve an environment,

39:25.097 --> 39:30.933
a community, a mini city,
which is carbon free and waste free.

39:32.057 --> 39:37.051
Now, that would be a tough challenge
anywhere in the world.

39:37.097 --> 39:40.089
To do it in a desert environment,
you could say, you know,

39:40.137 --> 39:43.573
"You must be crazy to even attempt it."

39:51.657 --> 39:55.093
Masdar will be powered by the sun.

39:57.017 --> 40:01.169
It will not waste a single drop of water.

40:03.417 --> 40:07.774
There will be no need
for gas-guzzling cars.

40:07.817 --> 40:10.411
The starting point for Masdar

40:10.457 --> 40:15.212
was really working with nature,
in terms of the solar cycle,

40:15.257 --> 40:18.806
making the greenery,
not just a cosmetic greenery,

40:18.857 --> 40:23.135
but creating shade,
burning the waste that we produce

40:23.177 --> 40:25.691
and, out of that process, creating energy.

40:25.737 --> 40:30.891
So it's starting with nature
and then it's using the technology,

40:30.937 --> 40:34.896
working with nature,
in harness with nature.

40:39.217 --> 40:43.051
It is a noble ambition
and it can be achieved.

40:45.497 --> 40:47.249
However, the immediate challenge

40:47.297 --> 40:51.927
is to try and change the way we live
with nature in our existing cities.

41:13.377 --> 41:17.290
This is the Union Square market
in New York.

41:17.337 --> 41:21.649
It sells produce that's grown locally,
often on the rooftops

41:21.697 --> 41:23.972
of New York's tower blocks.

41:24.017 --> 41:25.416
Hello, would you like
to try some of our honey?

41:25.457 --> 41:26.446
Buckwheat.

41:26.497 --> 41:29.091
- Local?
- Whipped honey, miss?

41:29.137 --> 41:30.490
- No?
- Too sweet?

41:30.537 --> 41:31.526
You're sweet enough?

41:31.577 --> 41:33.852
Good morning.

41:33.897 --> 41:37.492
Honey for you, miss?
Ah, you're doing the right thing.

41:37.537 --> 41:38.856
A traditionalist.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.695
Andrew Cote is the guru

41:41.737 --> 41:45.366
of high-rise beekeeping
and a third generation beekeeper.

41:46.937 --> 41:49.087
Until recently, urban beekeeping

41:49.137 --> 41:53.494
was illegal in New York,
but that didn't stop Andrew.

41:55.217 --> 41:58.493
Personally, in my case,
I was never caught.

41:58.537 --> 42:01.654
Even though I was very public
about having bees,

42:01.697 --> 42:04.655
I didn't tell people
exactly where they were.

42:04.697 --> 42:07.211
Yes, sir. $1 0, would you like a bag?

42:08.817 --> 42:13.686
Happily, New York changed its mind
and Andrew's mission

42:13.737 --> 42:16.297
is to bring bees into everyone's lives.

42:16.337 --> 42:20.615
Today, he's on the balcony
of a swanky Manhattan apartment

42:20.657 --> 42:22.887
with novice, Vivien Wang.

42:22.937 --> 42:24.495
You're going to have a problem

42:24.537 --> 42:27.131
with the outer cover, because there
are a lot of bees on the inside of it.

42:27.177 --> 42:28.690
Smoke 'em.

42:30.257 --> 42:31.531
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

42:31.577 --> 42:34.569
VIVIEN..Andrew is sort of the king bee,
I think, of urban beekeeping,

42:34.617 --> 42:36.733
and those of us who are his students,

42:36.777 --> 42:41.976
I think of myself as the
honey sorcerer's apprentice, in a way.

42:42.017 --> 42:43.245
What do you see?

42:43.297 --> 42:45.447
I see a lot of cap honey under here.

42:45.497 --> 42:48.057
- Mm-hm.
- And I see... It looks like...

42:48.097 --> 42:49.655
a lot of nectar.

42:49.697 --> 42:53.007
It's an unusual pastime
for a New York lawyer.

42:53.057 --> 42:55.491
I think my friends,
when I told them

42:55.537 --> 42:57.607
that I was going to start
being a beekeeper,

42:57.657 --> 43:01.093
were amused. They thought
it was quirky but kind of wonderful,

43:01.137 --> 43:04.971
because it's a different way for us
to all connect with nature.

43:05.017 --> 43:07.656
I think all of us need a little more
sweetness in our lives

43:07.697 --> 43:09.449
and it's nice to be able to cast our eyes

43:09.497 --> 43:13.968
skyward in this city, you know,
away and above the traffic,

43:14.017 --> 43:17.293
and think about all these bees
buzzing above our heads.

43:17.337 --> 43:21.489
But being a novice beekeeper
has its ups and downs.

43:21.537 --> 43:24.176
- Ow. Ow...
- What, what, what?

43:24.217 --> 43:28.051
Nothing. Sorry, I didn't know they
could sting through hands quite like that.

43:28.097 --> 43:30.770
They're stinging me like crazy.
I really want you to let go.

43:31.937 --> 43:37.330
There are now nearly ten million bees
living on the rooftops of New York.

43:43.177 --> 43:48.490
Over the river in Queens,
it's a special day for beekeeper Stefanos.

43:48.537 --> 43:51.768
He's harvesting his first honey
with Andrew's help.

43:54.897 --> 43:58.492
- This one's perfect. Couldn't be better.
- Oh, yes, look.

43:58.537 --> 44:01.654
I think we should give
the honey a taste, just...

44:01.697 --> 44:02.766
Just to make sure.

44:04.337 --> 44:07.215
Oh, man, this is going to be so good.

44:14.137 --> 44:15.616
Oh, my God.

44:20.457 --> 44:22.652
It's like caramelised sunlight.

44:24.497 --> 44:27.694
- It's just quality control.
- Right.

44:32.937 --> 44:38.091
Bees make honey and they pollinate
the city's parks and gardens.

44:38.137 --> 44:43.416
But most importantly, they bring
New Yorkers back in touch with nature.

44:48.057 --> 44:50.651
I think a lot of people
are beekeeping in the city

44:50.697 --> 44:53.416
because they want to feel
a connection to nature.

44:53.457 --> 44:56.733
They live in tall buildings,
they walk on asphalt...

44:57.777 --> 44:59.893
...they ride around
in trains under the ground.

44:59.937 --> 45:01.814
When they have a beehive
on their roof,

45:01.857 --> 45:03.609
they can spend one or two hours a week,

45:03.657 --> 45:06.888
and really be connected to nature,
and be creating their own food

45:06.937 --> 45:10.976
with almost no footprint,
and I think that's great.

45:12.817 --> 45:16.048
Beekeeping in New York
isn't going to save the planet,

45:16.097 --> 45:18.816
but it's a step in the right direction.

45:27.337 --> 45:29.851
There is just no doubt.

45:29.897 --> 45:32.809
If we are to continue living in cities,

45:32.857 --> 45:38.648
we'll have to stop stripping nature bare
with no thought for tomorrow.

45:38.697 --> 45:43.896
What we do in our homes and in our streets
affects the entire planet.

45:48.377 --> 45:53.735
The future of our civilisation
depends on us restoring the balance

45:53.777 --> 45:57.531
between the natural world
and the urban jungle.

45:59.137 --> 46:00.729
Can we do it?

46:04.817 --> 46:09.333
There are clear signs of hope
from around the world.

46:09.377 --> 46:14.690
We do have the intelligence and ingenuity
to adapt to a changing world.

46:14.737 --> 46:19.731
The ancient art of falconry now helps
protect the modern city of Dubai.

46:23.297 --> 46:28.769
We can work hand in hand with nature
to solve the problems we face.

46:30.417 --> 46:34.205
In India, we train fig trees
to make living bridges.

46:36.097 --> 46:39.931
And we team up with elephants
to extract valuable timber

46:39.977 --> 46:41.933
without trashing the whole forest.

46:44.057 --> 46:48.494
We can think as a community
and plan ahead. In Mali,

46:48.537 --> 46:52.246
the fish in this lake
are shared out only once a year.

46:59.337 --> 47:03.808
When we work together,
it's incredible what we can achieve.

47:03.857 --> 47:07.247
Everyone in the mud city of Djenne

47:07.297 --> 47:10.733
collaborates to protect
their sacred mosque.

47:15.017 --> 47:20.410
We have such spirit and such bravery
in the face of adversity.

47:23.457 --> 47:26.415
If we combine these natural abilities

47:26.457 --> 47:31.815
with the best of our imagination
and our biggest ideas

47:31.857 --> 47:35.691
then surely
our cities can adapt and change.

47:40.937 --> 47:44.976
The destiny of our planet
is now in human hands.

48:01.097 --> 48:07.286
Over three years, the Human Planet team
has filmed people around the world.

48:07.337 --> 48:12.650
All had amazing endurance,
local know-how, and ingenuity.

48:19.177 --> 48:22.886
Just keeping up with them
proved to be a huge challenge.

48:22.937 --> 48:28.330
The demands on our teams and kit
pushed them to the limit.

48:34.057 --> 48:39.290
Filming on an active volcano in Java
tested the cameras to breaking point.

48:41.417 --> 48:45.205
The crew were here
to film sulphur miners.

48:45.257 --> 48:51.093
The air they breathe
was a danger to both people and kit.

48:51.137 --> 48:54.607
I'm just going to go in there,
a bit closer, with a gas meter

48:54.657 --> 48:56.648
and see what it does.

48:59.017 --> 49:02.851
It's reading 93 parts per million.

49:02.897 --> 49:06.446
It's going up to 1 94 now.

49:06.497 --> 49:10.092
So we're right in the middle of a cloud.
We've got to get out.

49:10.137 --> 49:13.049
This is 40 times the safe working limit.

49:14.137 --> 49:19.052
The gas is a hydrogen sulphide mix
that corrodes every surface it lands on.

49:23.697 --> 49:28.612
The gas masks protected the crew,
but not the cameras.

49:31.297 --> 49:33.765
We've got an RF warning on the camera,

49:33.817 --> 49:37.446
which means that the signal's
not actually getting onto the tape.

49:37.497 --> 49:38.691
It's usually a head clog.

49:39.737 --> 49:43.650
The crew found that sulphide particles
had stuck to the tape head

49:43.697 --> 49:47.167
and open-heart surgery was needed.

49:47.217 --> 49:49.447
That's absolutely filthy.

49:49.497 --> 49:52.569
After cleaning,
the camera lived to work another day.

49:52.617 --> 49:55.575
- Hey!
- Ho-ho!

49:57.057 --> 50:01.289
But the crew's problems were nothing
compared to those faced daily

50:01.337 --> 50:02.816
by the sulphur miners.

50:08.537 --> 50:11.370
In the Sulu Sea off Borneo,

50:11.417 --> 50:13.453
cameraman Simon Enderby

50:13.497 --> 50:18.127
filmed a remarkable free-diving fisherman
called Sulbin.

50:23.457 --> 50:26.449
Here I was
with the latest in scuba gear,

50:26.497 --> 50:30.376
and he was swimming in a pair
of underpants and wooden goggles.

50:30.417 --> 50:32.931
We really made for a bizarre dive duo.

50:32.977 --> 50:36.174
To capture the perfect hunt,
I had to match my scuba-dive skills

50:36.217 --> 50:38.685
with those of Sulbin's free-diving.

50:38.737 --> 50:42.776
Our buoyancy, our swimming,
our search for food, and, finally,

50:42.817 --> 50:46.810
his successful capture of a fish,
all had to evolve together.

50:46.857 --> 50:52.250
Luckily, on the third dive, it all came
together, and we both came up happy.

50:52.297 --> 50:55.687
Oh, wow, mate, that's the one.
That's definitely the one.

51:02.577 --> 51:04.454
In the Philippines, we filmed fishermen

51:04.497 --> 51:08.012
herding all the fish on a reef
into a huge net.

51:09.577 --> 51:14.014
Here, we found that fish
can be adaptable too.

51:14.057 --> 51:18.335
Cameraman Roger Munns inadvertently
saved one fish from becoming supper.

51:22.177 --> 51:24.532
He nicknamed him Nemo.

51:24.577 --> 51:27.171
Nemo sheltered in Roger's dive kit

51:27.217 --> 51:29.777
and hid there until the coast was clear...

51:32.377 --> 51:34.891
...eventually swimming off back home.

51:44.617 --> 51:46.767
We filmed in many locations

51:46.817 --> 51:50.014
where people had never seen
film cameras before.

51:51.577 --> 51:56.128
In northern India, the children
constantly looked into the lens.

51:56.177 --> 52:00.295
So, to get the shots he wanted,
director Mark Flowers

52:00.337 --> 52:03.647
tried to distract the children
by singing a song.

52:03.697 --> 52:05.369
I never sing in my whole life!

52:07.257 --> 52:12.377
Much to his surprise, the children knew
the nursery rhymes better than he did.

52:12.417 --> 52:15.454
- # Twinkle, twinkle, little star... #
- We learn this.

52:15.497 --> 52:18.614
# How I wonder what you are

52:18.657 --> 52:24.414
# Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky. #

52:24.457 --> 52:26.607
Hooray!

52:32.337 --> 52:38.253
Filming at height always involves
complex safety measures.

52:38.297 --> 52:42.006
But in Central Africa,
the crew had an added complication.

52:43.137 --> 52:48.814
Tim Fogg rigged ropes
to film Tete collecting honey

52:48.857 --> 52:50.813
from a wild bees'nest.

52:52.737 --> 52:56.446
Unfortunately, the angry bees
went straight for Tim.

52:56.497 --> 53:00.206
- Think he'll be OK?
- Smoke! Smoke! Smoke, quickly!

53:05.217 --> 53:06.491
Can we get you out, Tim?

53:12.177 --> 53:16.136
The first thing I remember seeing
was a bee right in front of my face

53:16.177 --> 53:19.214
with its abdomen twisted
as if it was ready to sting me.

53:19.257 --> 53:20.246
They got inside?

53:20.297 --> 53:24.529
No, they were stinging through
the face mask and through the gloves.

53:24.577 --> 53:26.647
After 30 stings,

53:26.697 --> 53:31.452
Tim fully appreciated Tete's bravery
in gathering honey for his family.

53:35.697 --> 53:41.454
When filming people with animals,
nothing's entirely predictable.

53:43.257 --> 53:46.010
In Greenland,
director Nic Brown wanted to film

53:46.057 --> 53:51.927
the Inuit catching the elusive Greenland
shark that lives in these deep waters.

54:01.257 --> 54:03.851
-After an anxious ten days,

54:03.897 --> 54:06.411
everyone was thrilled when,

54:06.457 --> 54:10.211
in the middle of the night,
they finally felt something on the line.

54:10.257 --> 54:11.372
We're very excited

54:11.417 --> 54:14.454
because we've all been
playing with the line

54:14.497 --> 54:16.965
that's 800 metres down into the water

54:17.017 --> 54:20.407
and you can actually feel
the shark on the end of it.

54:22.297 --> 54:26.256
Somewhere down there we think we've
got a, er, Greenland shark on a hook.

54:26.297 --> 54:28.015
We're hoping.

54:28.057 --> 54:30.207
This is the hole for our underwater camera

54:30.257 --> 54:32.293
- and this is the hole...
- A shark hole?

54:32.337 --> 54:34.009
...for the shark.

54:35.337 --> 54:39.250
They discovered
they'd underestimated the hole size,

54:39.297 --> 54:43.085
because the Jensens had caught
a huge four-metre-long shark.

54:55.577 --> 54:58.614
Co-ordinating helicopters
with action on the ground

54:58.657 --> 55:01.376
is both expensive and difficult.

55:01.417 --> 55:04.454
But in Australia, director Susan McMillan

55:04.497 --> 55:07.136
had to co-ordinate
three helicopters at once.

55:07.177 --> 55:11.614
Two of them were flown by heli-cowboys
Ben Tapp

55:11.657 --> 55:15.809
and his mate Rankin,
dicing with death to corral their cattle.

55:17.417 --> 55:20.215
The challenges of filming
with three helicopters in the air

55:20.257 --> 55:21.975
have been quite considerable on this trip,

55:22.017 --> 55:23.894
because I'm filming it for real.

55:23.937 --> 55:26.087
It's not a drama and there's no take two.

55:26.137 --> 55:28.446
I have to actually capture the event
as it happens,

55:28.497 --> 55:33.287
and it's quite a dangerous situation.
I've got three helicopters in the air,

55:33.337 --> 55:35.214
I've got quad bikes and horses
on the ground,

55:35.257 --> 55:37.407
I've got stampeding cattle,

55:37.457 --> 55:41.086
so, actually, the biggest pressure,
I think, has been safety.

55:46.217 --> 55:48.526
Working on the ground
can be just as dangerous,

55:48.577 --> 55:52.695
especially when it comes to big cats.

55:52.737 --> 55:56.616
The crew wanted to film
Dorobo tribesmen in Kenya

55:56.657 --> 55:57.931
chasing lions off a kill.

56:00.457 --> 56:05.053
So cameraman Toby Strong
offered to film with them on foot,

56:05.097 --> 56:07.167
to be in the thick of the action.

56:07.217 --> 56:12.735
The thought of getting out of a vehicle
and walking towards lions on foot

56:12.777 --> 56:16.133
goes against
every common sense bone in my body.

56:17.177 --> 56:19.737
I mean, these guys are...
these guys are amazing.

56:19.777 --> 56:22.849
They, um...
They've got their bows and arrows.

56:22.897 --> 56:25.650
But, um, I haven't got anything!

56:25.697 --> 56:26.891
I've got...

56:26.937 --> 56:30.452
...I've got a camera and a lens cap
to protect myself with.

56:30.497 --> 56:32.692
It's getting a bit real, though, isn't it?

56:32.737 --> 56:34.056
Butterflies in the stomach.

56:39.857 --> 56:44.726
Having located the lions, Toby
followed the Dorobo as they moved in

56:44.777 --> 56:47.086
to have a look.

56:48.337 --> 56:52.455
Walking down there towards thick bushes
where you know there are lions, it, um...

56:52.497 --> 56:55.534
God, it's something very primal
in the back of your neck,

56:55.577 --> 56:57.807
and everything...
the hairs on the back of your neck

56:57.857 --> 56:59.768
and you just feel these eyes on you,

56:59.817 --> 57:01.489
but you feel very, very alive.

57:01.537 --> 57:05.325
It's a magical feeling. It's, um...
I sort of recommend it to everyone.

57:05.377 --> 57:07.766
Before going to work,
have a walk through lion country.

57:07.817 --> 57:09.569
It gets things in perspective.

57:09.617 --> 57:11.289
Yeah, amazing.

57:14.257 --> 57:16.612
Without the co-operation
and support of all the people

57:16.657 --> 57:19.296
we filmed around the world,

57:19.337 --> 57:21.976
this series could not have been made.

57:23.857 --> 57:27.247
Their unique knowledge and survival skills

57:27.297 --> 57:31.609
have relevance for us all
in an increasingly human planet.
