But it's mostly his mind.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.083
Yeah. [chuckles]

02:20.291 --> 02:22.208
Maybe they
should write a comic

you is already off the charts.

16:30.458 --> 16:35.250
[dramatic ominous music]

16:36.083 --> 16:37.083
Charm.

16:37.416 --> 16:41.416
[gentle suspenseful music]

16:45.166 --> 16:48.833
[dramatic tense music]

16:57.333 --> 16:58.916
[eerie foreboding music]

16:59.000 --> 17:05.916
[thermometer beeping]

17:24.541 --> 17:25.500
[Faith sighs]

17:25.583 --> 17:29.541
[gentle suspenseful music]

17:31.166 --> 17:33.208
[wind whistling]

17:41.291 --> 17:42.333
[thermometer beeping]

17:42.500 --> 17:43.166
[creature growling]

17:43.250 --> 17:45.166
[cloth ripping]

17:46.875 --> 17:48.166
[objects thudding]

17:48.958 --> 17:50.125
[creature growling]

17:50.208 --> 17:52.125
[objects thudding]

17:52.208 --> 17:56.166
[dramatic suspenseful music]

17:59.958 --> 18:02.166
[creature screeching]

18:11.125 --> 18:12.333
[Faith grunts]

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
[wood banging]

18:18.250 --> 18:19.666
You hammer,
I'll see to his knee,

18:19.750 --> 18:21.291
and we'll figure
out the rest later.

18:21.375 --> 18:24.125
[wind whistling]

18:32.625 --> 18:34.125
[Charm gasps]

18:36.166 --> 18:37.583
[Charm exhaling]

18:40.583 --> 18:43.583
[gentle eerie music]

19:11.083 --> 19:14.750
Nice house. Must be
one heck of a nurse.

19:15.833 --> 19:17.083
I had a hospice patient.

19:17.458 --> 19:18.500
We worked together
for two years.

19:18.583 --> 19:19.458
I didn't think she
liked me very much,

19:19.541 --> 19:23.291
but she went, her will came,

19:23.375 --> 19:24.625
it was hers, and now it's mine.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.083
Thanks.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.791
Guest room.
It's yours for the night.

19:32.958 --> 19:34.125
[wind whistling]

19:34.208 --> 19:36.458
[necklace jangling]

19:37.458 --> 19:38.583
Does that make you feel safe?

19:41.791 --> 19:45.083
Yeah, absolutely. What
makes you feel safe?

19:46.916 --> 19:48.916
Big bats with screws in them.

19:52.708 --> 19:55.000
So what's your daughter's deal?

19:56.833 --> 19:58.833
I told you. She has a fever.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.916
Yeah, it must be pretty bad.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.041
And all the metal.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.000
She's prone to
psychotic episodes.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.041
I'd insist that you stay away.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.625
You're the boss, Nightingale.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.041
Yeah.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.500
Thanks again.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.250
[footsteps thumping]

20:25.875 --> 20:26.875
[Charm] I heard voices.

20:28.375 --> 20:29.958
Are there really
people down there?

20:30.041 --> 20:32.000
[Faith] Uh, yeah, they just,
they got caught in the storm,

20:32.083 --> 20:34.625
so it's just gonna
be for a few hours.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.625
I could get dressed, say hi.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.208
You know that's not a good idea.

20:40.708 --> 20:45.583
I just, I just wanna
talk to somebody.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.791
Charm, these people, they're,
they're drifters, okay?

20:48.875 --> 20:50.500
The 8 ball they did in
the shelter's probably

20:50.583 --> 20:52.708
the only reason why
they're not frozen solid.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.291
You would know.

20:56.791 --> 20:57.791
I would fucking know!

20:59.666 --> 21:02.625
[wind whistling]

21:02.708 --> 21:05.875
Can you just trust
me for once? Please?

21:07.541 --> 21:08.958
[door banging]

21:11.083 --> 21:12.958
[creature growling]

21:18.583 --> 21:20.583
[door slams]

21:20.958 --> 21:22.041
2.4 degrees.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.833
That's all that's keeping her
from slipping away from me.

21:26.750 --> 21:27.625
Again.

21:28.041 --> 21:30.416
[eerie unsettling music]

21:30.500 --> 21:33.916
I know addiction,
I know sickness,

21:36.166 --> 21:41.500
but what has Charm is
a biological nightmare,

21:44.083 --> 21:45.541
and I'm fighting it the
only way that I know how,

21:46.166 --> 21:47.333
[liquid burbling]

21:52.375 --> 21:55.041
but that, that safe
zone, that coveted window

21:56.125 --> 21:58.125
is getting harder and
harder to maintain.

22:02.750 --> 22:08.625
I'm so tired and my
sweet, sweet girl, she is

22:09.000 --> 22:09.958
[Charm screaming]

22:10.041 --> 22:11.458
[creature growling]

22:11.875 --> 22:13.000
running out of time.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.041
[eerie suspenseful music]

22:22.333 --> 22:23.333
[Kory grunts]

22:26.416 --> 22:29.416
[gentle eerie music]

22:44.750 --> 22:46.625
[Kory] [exhales] We got lucky.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.291
Wasn't luck.

22:48.541 --> 22:49.750
Yeah, no, I know it.

22:49.833 --> 22:51.375
I'm just, you know what I mean.

22:51.458 --> 22:54.250
You mean we found the house
at the end of the rainbow

22:54.333 --> 22:55.791
like the leprechaun
said we would?

22:56.458 --> 22:58.041
Oh, look under the cushion.

22:58.125 --> 23:00.875
Maybe there's some gold coins
sprinkled about, laddie.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.416
I get it already.

23:02.583 --> 23:04.041
And credit where it's due, huh?

23:04.125 --> 23:05.750
No, just saying

23:06.541 --> 23:09.041
that this is an extremely
fortunate situation.

23:09.333 --> 23:11.916
Found a nice warm
house with the power on

23:12.000 --> 23:16.083
and the hostess is a nurse among
other bucket-list fetishes.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.291
That was a joke, Liz.

23:19.375 --> 23:21.291
[sighs] But I
tell you that anyone

23:21.375 --> 23:23.041
who looks at a woman lustfully

23:23.125 --> 23:26.125
has already committed adultery
with her in his heart.

23:26.875 --> 23:30.416
Liz, I'm not married.

23:34.083 --> 23:38.750
I'm sorry. I'm in your
corner no matter what.

23:40.583 --> 23:45.125
We just can't have
another misunderstanding.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.416
Okay.

23:48.958 --> 23:49.958
Not now.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.791
[unsettling foreboding music]

23:54.083 --> 23:56.083
[Faith humming]

23:56.708 --> 23:58.541
[Charm] So what are you
looking for exactly?

23:59.083 --> 24:00.291
Intracranial hemorrhaging.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.791
It's a possible side effect
from a prolonged fever.

24:04.375 --> 24:05.958
So brain damage.

24:07.416 --> 24:09.000
It's just a precaution.

24:09.333 --> 24:12.333
Heavy recovery from any
medication has a mini withdrawal

24:12.666 --> 24:14.375
Psychosis is a possibility.

24:14.458 --> 24:15.916
Auditory and visual
hallucinations,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.708
lucid sleepwalking,
but you'll be fine.

24:24.958 --> 24:30.125
When you said you made mistakes
before, was I one of them?

24:36.541 --> 24:38.083
I've made mistakes before you,

24:39.375 --> 24:41.833
after you, with you,

24:45.083 --> 24:46.291
but never you.

24:50.166 --> 24:53.791
So who are they downstairs?

24:55.708 --> 25:00.000
Um, they're just some kids
who got caught in the storm.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
Kids?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.583
Well, no, no, they're adults.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.625
Well, you just said kids.

25:05.708 --> 25:06.833
Okay, it's a figure of speech.

25:06.916 --> 25:08.333
Which is the exact
opposite of adults.

25:08.416 --> 25:09.000
Why are you pushing me?

25:09.083 --> 25:10.250
I'm not pushing you.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.708
I just wanna have some
normal interaction with-

25:11.791 --> 25:13.708
Well, you're not normal!

25:18.125 --> 25:19.625
[wind whistling]

25:19.708 --> 25:22.291
You're more, Charm.

25:23.583 --> 25:24.708
You're more, okay?

25:24.791 --> 25:27.625
You're more than anyone
could ever understand.

25:29.166 --> 25:30.666
And what's happening right now

25:30.750 --> 25:33.333
leads away from logic
into pure phenomena,

25:34.625 --> 25:36.583
so it, it, it
doesn't make it easier.

25:36.666 --> 25:40.375
It makes it harder. [exhales]

25:40.458 --> 25:42.291
[gentle eerie music]

25:42.375 --> 25:46.166
I promise I won't
give up if you don't,

25:47.250 --> 25:48.500
but you have to trust me.

25:57.833 --> 25:59.958
All right. Maybe a quick dinner.

26:01.250 --> 26:04.875
[pills clattering]

26:04.958 --> 26:08.708
What are those? Those aren't
what you normally, um...

26:10.625 --> 26:12.583
Dinner or not, kiddo?

26:12.666 --> 26:19.458
[tense unsettling music]

26:26.625 --> 26:29.375
Okay. Well, I will
leave the door unlocked.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.875
Come down in about 20 minutes.

26:41.625 --> 26:44.625
[tense suspenseful music]

26:59.166 --> 27:00.166
[door creaks]

27:00.583 --> 27:03.583
[tense unsettling music]

27:05.000 --> 27:07.041
[Kory grunting]

27:22.833 --> 27:24.875
[toilet flushes]

27:33.291 --> 27:35.250
Oh, come on man. You're
gotta say something.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.333
She's gonna think you're
a fucking serial killer.

27:37.416 --> 27:40.583
Um, hey, going hiking?

27:41.500 --> 27:44.500
[wind whistling]

27:47.416 --> 27:49.416
[Charm] Who are you now?

27:49.625 --> 27:51.416
Our little home invader?

27:51.500 --> 27:53.666
Yeah. Yep, that's me, Kory.

27:53.750 --> 27:56.583
Sorry, um, uh, it, it, it, just,

27:56.666 --> 27:58.625
I'm not, I'm not
dangerous, okay.

27:58.875 --> 28:00.958
Said every serial killer ever.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.375
Okay, please, please
don't. Please don't scream.

28:03.458 --> 28:04.083
Liz will freak out and then-

28:04.166 --> 28:05.416
Liz?

28:05.500 --> 28:07.791
Yeah, that's my sister who
thinks she is my mother.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.041
You know, I love her,
I, I, it's just like,

28:10.125 --> 28:12.875
don't you wish people would
back the fuck off sometimes?

28:13.458 --> 28:16.583
All the time.
You coming out or what?

28:17.291 --> 28:20.708
Uh, I was sort of
thinking I'd stay here

28:20.791 --> 28:23.000
because, uh,
if you don't see me,

28:23.083 --> 28:26.208
then we got a little bit of,
uh, uh, plausible deniability,

28:26.291 --> 28:27.250
you know what I mean?

28:34.416 --> 28:37.708
So you're pretty
into porcupines, huh?

28:39.583 --> 28:40.541
[Charm] I hate them.

28:41.125 --> 28:44.541
Oh, yeah, sure.
That explains the shrine.

28:45.125 --> 28:46.500
It's hard to exert
control over something

28:46.583 --> 28:48.583
when you're too
busy running from it.

28:49.125 --> 28:51.333
Sounds like you got
some adult concerns.

28:51.958 --> 28:54.541
Yeah, I'm
juggling a few others.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.875
Oh, yeah. Like what?

28:58.875 --> 29:01.791
Like the effect antifreeze
has on one's innards.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.833
Did you know porcupine
means pig with swords?

29:10.000 --> 29:13.375
Did you know their quills
are basically calcified hair?

29:13.583 --> 29:14.916
[Kory] I did not.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.625
And that at the right angle
they sink into the flesh,

29:16.708 --> 29:18.208
like hot rebar.

29:18.500 --> 29:21.291
[chuckles] How did
you find that out?

29:24.083 --> 29:25.083
The hard way.

29:26.166 --> 29:28.083
[dramatic tense music]

29:28.166 --> 29:30.458
My mom had surprised me
with a trip to the zoo.

29:32.875 --> 29:34.250
Like always, she felt bad

29:34.333 --> 29:35.833
and thought this would
make everything okay.

29:35.916 --> 29:37.458
[people chattering indistinctly]

29:39.666 --> 29:40.666
You wanna take it
outta my pocket?

29:40.750 --> 29:41.708
-Yeah, I do!
-But even then

29:41.791 --> 29:43.208
I could see
through her bullshit.

29:43.291 --> 29:45.166
[Faith] Where is it, huh?
What you gonna do with it?

29:45.250 --> 29:47.166
What are you gonna do with
it? Better give it on back!

29:47.458 --> 29:49.458
-The look in her eye.
-Who you gonna sell it to?

29:49.583 --> 29:50.583
[Charm] It was
more than hunger.

29:50.791 --> 29:54.458
It was, it scared me,

29:56.708 --> 29:57.666
so I ran.

29:57.750 --> 30:01.708
[unsettling foreboding music]

30:01.958 --> 30:05.916
There were people everywhere,
but no one helped.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.416
[door creaking]

30:13.916 --> 30:16.125
Ran through the first
door I could find,

30:19.541 --> 30:20.541
the wrong one.

30:21.375 --> 30:22.541
Mama, Mama, Mama.

30:22.625 --> 30:24.166
The smell hit me first.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.125
[porcupine growling]

30:25.208 --> 30:28.375
Then I, I saw it.

30:30.208 --> 30:31.416
[Charm yelling]

30:33.291 --> 30:38.458
Possession, negligence. They
arrested her on the spot.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.041
How long did they keep her?

30:41.500 --> 30:46.041
She kept herself. 7
rehab stints in 10 years.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.333
But, but she's, uh, she's all
better now, though, right?

30:51.416 --> 30:54.500
Like she's, uh,
rehabilitated or whatever.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.375
Part of recovering
is letting go.

31:00.708 --> 31:01.750
She has this old suitcase

31:01.833 --> 31:03.666
from her party days
out in the garage.

31:04.750 --> 31:05.750
Probably still something

31:05.833 --> 31:08.208
in there to make
all the pain go away.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.333
Guess all that shit with
your mom is the reason

31:11.416 --> 31:13.750
you got the whole tortured
artist thing going on, right?

31:13.833 --> 31:15.916
I mean, well,
I mean almost anyway, right?

31:16.000 --> 31:16.958
What do you mean?

31:17.083 --> 31:18.541
I don't know, I mean, um,

31:18.750 --> 31:21.916
no obsession is complete
without a cool origin story, so.

31:23.166 --> 31:25.833
Some battle scars might have
sold it better. That's all.

31:25.916 --> 31:29.833
[gentle suspenseful music]

31:33.458 --> 31:36.458
[gentle eerie music]

31:45.041 --> 31:46.583
[Faith] Honey
are you coming down?

31:48.416 --> 31:49.875
[chuckles] Guess it's showtime.

31:49.958 --> 31:51.791
[Kory] Yeah, yeah,
I guess I better, um...

31:51.875 --> 31:53.375
Escape?

31:55.291 --> 31:56.958
No one's getting
out of this zoo.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.208
[Kory grunts]

32:15.916 --> 32:17.666
[Charm exhales]

32:19.541 --> 32:20.541
What? Okay.

32:22.250 --> 32:24.208
[Kory grunting]

32:24.291 --> 32:26.250
-Pass that.
-Oh, thank you.

32:26.416 --> 32:27.416
Thanks.

32:27.791 --> 32:28.791
Smells great, ma'am.

32:34.541 --> 32:39.541
Hi, Charm. Uh, this is
Liz and that's Kory.

32:42.958 --> 32:46.666
Uh, we appreciate
your hospitality.

32:48.625 --> 32:49.958
We'll see.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.750
Uh, before we start eating,

32:55.833 --> 32:58.708
I would be honored to
lead us in a blessing.

32:58.791 --> 33:00.125
If we could all join hands?

33:05.166 --> 33:06.166
[Liz clears throat]

33:06.750 --> 33:10.291
Heavenly Father, thank you
for leading us out of the cold

33:10.375 --> 33:13.000
and into the limitless
warmth of Your love.

33:13.500 --> 33:16.625
Please bless our food,
but especially our host,

33:17.083 --> 33:19.458
hostesses who have graced us

33:19.541 --> 33:21.625
with an all-too-rare compassion.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.041
In Your name, we say

33:24.125 --> 33:25.250
-amen.
-[Faith clears throat]

33:27.583 --> 33:28.958
[Faith clears throat]

33:30.333 --> 33:31.666
Let's eat.

33:31.916 --> 33:34.666
So we're making tracks along
the road outside Shelby Bowl,

33:34.750 --> 33:36.125
and then the snow just
starts dumping on us.

33:36.208 --> 33:38.875
Mm-hmm, and we need shelter,
but we wanna keep moving.

33:38.958 --> 33:40.458
-Bus, right?
-Wrong.

33:40.541 --> 33:42.375
[Liz] Some kind human
took it upon themselves

33:42.458 --> 33:44.625
to knock down every
stop marker for like-

33:44.708 --> 33:46.166
For like, it's
like two miles easy.

33:46.250 --> 33:47.458
So the buses are going by us

33:47.541 --> 33:48.875
and we're screaming
bloody murder.

33:48.958 --> 33:52.250
Yeah, for hours, so then
I gave up and I sat down-

33:52.333 --> 33:53.458
In the snow.

33:53.541 --> 33:54.500
And I cried.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.625
Yes, you did.

33:55.791 --> 33:58.666
Mm, why didn't you just pray

33:58.750 --> 34:00.791
for the limitless
warmth of His love?

34:05.916 --> 34:08.750
Uh, I did that, too.

34:08.833 --> 34:10.250
Well, help me understand.

34:10.333 --> 34:11.583
Like, maybe you can
explain it to me.

34:11.708 --> 34:15.625
So when you have food
right, you thank Him for it,

34:15.708 --> 34:19.041
but when you are trapped
in sub-zero temperatures,

34:19.125 --> 34:20.958
that's a sign, right?

34:21.625 --> 34:23.083
A sign of what?

34:23.291 --> 34:25.250
That God wants you
to freeze to death.

34:26.125 --> 34:30.000
I don't think God wants
anyone to freeze to death.

34:30.083 --> 34:35.666
I think God uses the cold
like a farmer would use

34:35.750 --> 34:39.500
an electric fence to steer
you to where you belong.

34:39.875 --> 34:42.791
Okay, so say God
steers you here

34:43.000 --> 34:45.916
and I send you right back out
the window that you came in,

34:46.666 --> 34:50.500
and then, you know,
something bad happens.

34:50.916 --> 34:52.041
Who's the guilty party?

34:52.916 --> 34:54.291
The party that feels guilty.

34:55.541 --> 34:56.625
I don't know.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.916
Doesn't His plan kind of
give me an out, though?

34:59.250 --> 35:01.291
Like, no repercussions,
cause like, whatever I do,

35:01.375 --> 35:05.500
whatever happens,
it's His plan, right?

35:08.666 --> 35:11.250
Well, God...

35:11.541 --> 35:13.916
Have you ever heard
of the term PBAB?

35:15.083 --> 35:16.583
Pine box at bedside?

35:18.958 --> 35:22.125
Yeah, I've been a
nurse for 10 years now,

35:22.333 --> 35:23.583
and I've helped more
people evade death

35:23.666 --> 35:25.500
than you could even fathom,

35:25.791 --> 35:27.666
and it wasn't because I
waited for holy intervention

35:27.750 --> 35:29.333
or because I
trusted in the plan.

35:29.750 --> 35:32.500
I acted. The use of
science is an act.

35:33.041 --> 35:35.333
And the people who believe
in the myth to save them,

35:35.666 --> 35:38.458
they build those pine boxes
and the people who act,

35:38.708 --> 35:40.166
we keep them empty.

35:44.500 --> 35:47.958
I think one day
you're gonna wonder

35:48.041 --> 35:49.500
what else you are wrong about.

35:53.333 --> 35:54.333
Emerald twilight.

35:56.333 --> 35:57.083
What?

35:57.291 --> 36:00.291
Oh, Mom, you're gonna love this.

36:00.708 --> 36:03.416
Hal Jordan, Earth's
Green Lantern, uh,

36:03.500 --> 36:06.458
he comes back from this cosmic
ass-kicking marathon, right?

36:06.875 --> 36:10.375
And he finds his home, Coast
City, completely annihilated.

36:10.791 --> 36:15.500
Everything he ever loved or
held dear is just a crater.

36:17.375 --> 36:21.791
So he's devastated
and he gets an idea.

36:23.625 --> 36:27.041
He uses his ring to
resurrect Coast City.

36:28.041 --> 36:30.958
All the buildings are back
and people stroll the streets,

36:32.041 --> 36:34.333
holding hands and
sharing embraces

36:34.416 --> 36:35.500
with the one who got away.

36:35.583 --> 36:37.500
He even spends time
with his dead mother

36:37.583 --> 36:40.250
[gentle suspenseful music]

36:40.333 --> 36:41.791
till his ring runs out of power.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.000
So he shoots up into space to
get back to his home planet

36:45.083 --> 36:49.625
where their,
where their power source is,

36:50.958 --> 36:52.041
and he needs it.

36:52.875 --> 36:54.791
He needs all of it to
keep Coast City alive,

36:54.875 --> 36:57.041
but the, the Guardians
and the other Lanterns,

36:57.125 --> 37:00.958
they won't let him have it,
so he obliterates them all.

37:01.041 --> 37:02.000
[Charm chuckles]

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Charm. Charm?

37:05.375 --> 37:08.500
No one feels guilty if
they're destroying something

37:08.583 --> 37:09.791
in order to build.

37:10.333 --> 37:16.500
Not God, not superheroes,
not fucking politicians.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.000
[gentle suspenseful
music continues]

37:21.958 --> 37:23.666
But I think we should.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.666
I, I think.

37:26.541 --> 37:28.750
-[Charm gasping]
-[dramatic foreboding music]

37:28.833 --> 37:30.166
Charm. Charm!

37:30.250 --> 37:31.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Charm!

37:31.958 --> 37:33.708
Oh my god, this is a
seizure. What do we do?

37:33.791 --> 37:35.291
Can't just stand here.
We gotta do something.

37:35.375 --> 37:36.666
Help me lie her straight.

37:36.750 --> 37:37.833
No, you're supposed to put
something in her mouth.

37:37.916 --> 37:39.125
What, are you a doctor now?

37:39.208 --> 37:40.500
She's gonna fucking die, man!

37:41.666 --> 37:42.458
[Charm gasping]

37:42.541 --> 37:44.416
Shit. The power transfer switch.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.333
Oh great, the power transfer
switch. That's lovely.

37:46.416 --> 37:47.250
Calm down!

37:47.333 --> 37:48.750
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.791
We can't see shit and there's
a girl dying on the floor.

37:50.875 --> 37:51.750
I apologize for losing my zen.

37:51.833 --> 37:52.875
-Okay.
-You, you have

37:52.958 --> 37:54.333
like a, a backup
generator or something?

37:54.416 --> 37:55.583
No, it should have kicked on.

37:55.666 --> 37:56.833
Flashlights?

37:56.916 --> 37:58.333
[Charm gasping]

37:58.416 --> 38:02.125
Yes, there is a backup jenny
in the corner of the garage.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.250
All right, you guys take these.

38:04.333 --> 38:04.875
Go turn the switch on.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.041
What, why us?

38:06.125 --> 38:07.250
We don't know anything
about generators.

38:07.333 --> 38:08.333
Because I need to be
here with my daughter.

38:08.416 --> 38:09.875
Um, okay, he, he, he's right.

38:09.958 --> 38:11.208
Okay, we don't know
what we're doing,

38:11.291 --> 38:13.500
so why don't you take him
and I'll stay with her.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.708
-[Charm grunting]
-[Charm's body thudding]

38:17.791 --> 38:20.833
Okay, let's go.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.833
After this, team meeting.

38:22.916 --> 38:25.041
[Charm grunting]

38:27.291 --> 38:32.250
Uh, okay, just um,
[exhales] stay there.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.166
[Kory] S- so, uh, Charm's dad,

38:41.250 --> 38:43.125
is he, is he in the picture?

38:44.041 --> 38:45.541
I cut him out a long time ago.

38:46.083 --> 38:47.333
Doesn't stop him
from squirming in

38:47.416 --> 38:48.458
every now and then, but...

38:50.166 --> 38:54.375
[sighs] Shit. Can you
give me some light?

38:55.125 --> 38:57.750
[Kory] Uh-huh. [sighs]

38:58.750 --> 39:00.958
You know, I think the
whole body positivity thing

39:01.041 --> 39:02.583
is super hot.

[hand smacking]

39:28.208 --> 39:31.166
[eerie ominous music]

39:40.625 --> 39:41.625
Are you all right?

39:45.458 --> 39:47.083
Like, if you need help,

39:49.833 --> 39:53.708
if something's wrong,
like, really wrong,

39:56.541 --> 39:58.541
you just have to tell me.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.458

Charm?

41:19.708 --> 41:21.166
[Charm] Help me, Mama.

41:21.666 --> 41:25.458
O- okay, just, just, just
wait a second! You guys!

41:26.083 --> 41:29.083
[Liz breathing heavily]

[Charm] Can you follow my voice?

42:25.791 --> 42:27.333
[Liz grunting]

42:27.791 --> 42:32.041
I'll go as far as I can, but
you're gonna have to meet me.

42:35.458 --> 42:37.458
Charm, are you coming?

42:48.750 --> 42:51.750
[mysterious crackling]

Our Father Who art in
heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

I shall not want.

Hello?

-Hurry, open this door!

Hurry, open the fucking door!

Somebody open this door!

43:46.458 --> 43:48.375

43:48.458 --> 43:49.375
[Kory] We got you. Hey, hey.

43:49.458 --> 43:50.583
[gasping] Oh no.

43:54.041 --> 43:54.875
There is, [gasping] there
is something out there.

43:54.958 --> 43:56.375
-What?
-Okay, maybe there is.

43:56.458 --> 43:59.250
There's a tunnel all the way
to your damn mailbox, okay?

43:59.333 --> 44:01.458
-Come here, come here.
-well, where's Charm?

44:02.500 --> 44:03.583
-Something was chasing me.
-Charm. Charm.

44:08.583 --> 44:09.541
Ice tunnel?

44:09.625 --> 44:11.541
Yes. Go look, I swear!

44:11.625 --> 44:13.416
[tool clatters]

44:13.500 --> 44:14.541
What the fuck?

44:14.625 --> 44:15.583
[Liz gasping]

44:17.916 --> 44:18.833
[snow rumbling]

[door creaking]

44:22.291 --> 44:23.666
[door slams]

44:24.291 --> 44:29.791
Something is wrong here.
Have you been seeing things.

44:30.416 --> 44:31.583
With all the pills
I've been taking,

44:31.666 --> 44:32.875
I don't think I'm
seeing enough things.

44:32.958 --> 44:33.916
Look, I'm being serious!

44:34.000 --> 44:35.458
Yeah, and I'm
being logical, dude.

44:35.541 --> 44:39.208
Like, we're all tired and
hungry and fucking horny, okay?

44:39.291 --> 44:41.666
So I think some minor
freakouts are allowed.

44:43.833 --> 44:44.458
She drugged us.

44:44.541 --> 44:45.750
What?

44:45.833 --> 44:49.083
I was fine until we ate
and then, and then I, I,

44:49.166 --> 44:50.625
-I thought I saw.
-Oh, no, no, no.

44:50.708 --> 44:51.833
I ate the same thing you did.

44:52.125 --> 44:53.458
Maybe it's too
busy bouncing off

44:53.541 --> 44:54.875
all the other crap
in your system.

44:54.958 --> 44:56.166
Yeah, and maybe
it's like the time

44:56.250 --> 44:58.500
you saw St. Anthony
in the shower.

44:58.750 --> 45:00.375
Look, you want me to
concur with something?

45:00.458 --> 45:03.583
I'll concur that Charm is a
few bats short of a belfry.

45:04.250 --> 45:06.500
Or is it too many bats?
It's too many bats, right?

45:07.708 --> 45:08.750
I think she's here
against her will.

45:08.833 --> 45:10.041
[Kory sighs]

45:10.125 --> 45:12.750
The, the seizures, the
door. It, it makes sense.

45:12.833 --> 45:13.708
No, it do-

45:13.791 --> 45:16.083
I, I talked to her, okay.

45:16.166 --> 45:19.291
She would've told me if she
was a, like a fucking hostage.

45:21.083 --> 45:23.500
It's my face. Makes
girls wanna open up.

45:23.583 --> 45:26.958
-Ugh.
-Don't. Hey, don't, okay?

45:27.875 --> 45:29.166
Your neurotic hunch
is gonna put us

45:29.250 --> 45:30.708
in a freeze-to-death situation.

45:30.791 --> 45:34.958
So you would ignore a
captive human to stay warm?

45:35.375 --> 45:37.375
I am disabled.

45:39.041 --> 45:44.375
Just [grunting] get some
rest, okay, Nancy Drew?

45:44.750 --> 45:47.916
We're hitting the slopes
tomorrow, no skis.

45:50.791 --> 45:52.791
You know, when
they delivered you,

45:54.291 --> 45:58.083
both of your lungs collapsed,
and the umbilical cord

45:58.166 --> 45:59.625
wrapped around your
neck was not helping.

46:01.250 --> 46:02.541
You weighed two pounds.

46:04.125 --> 46:06.708
When they tried to check you
out in the corner of the room,

46:06.791 --> 46:07.916
the power died,

46:10.916 --> 46:12.750
and I didn't know
what was happening.

46:13.750 --> 46:16.000
You know, I was so
disoriented from the drugs,

46:16.083 --> 46:17.166
theirs and my own.

46:18.083 --> 46:19.041
I didn't know what was going on,

46:19.125 --> 46:20.708
but I could hear them talking

46:21.250 --> 46:23.458
and they were talking about
you like you were already dead.

46:24.916 --> 46:26.916
And I knew that I
couldn't be there for you,

46:28.625 --> 46:30.583
that you would have to
be your own battery,

46:30.666 --> 46:33.500
your own safety, your own charm,

46:36.041 --> 46:39.041
but this time, this time,

46:39.125 --> 46:41.208
I'm here to pull
you out of the dark.

46:41.291 --> 46:45.791
[gentle melancholy music]

46:45.875 --> 46:46.958
[kiss smacks]

46:52.291 --> 46:56.291
[gentle suspenseful music]

46:59.291 --> 47:02.083
[door creaking]

47:02.166 --> 47:02.916
[latch clicks]

47:03.500 --> 47:05.000
[Charm sighs]

47:05.416 --> 47:06.416
[recorder clicks]

47:06.875 --> 47:09.333
The substitute compound is
making her more aggressive.

47:10.416 --> 47:16.208
I might have to, [exhales]
I might have to. Fuck!

47:16.291 --> 47:18.916
[objects clattering]

47:21.375 --> 47:22.375
Fuck.

47:27.083 --> 47:27.958
Fuck.

47:38.083 --> 47:40.250
[creature rumbling]

47:40.333 --> 47:42.666
[creature thudding]

47:42.750 --> 47:44.541
[creature growling]

47:45.291 --> 47:48.291
[dramatic tense music]

47:48.708 --> 47:51.708
[Kory gasping]

48:02.125 --> 48:05.375
[dramatic suspenseful music]

48:08.500 --> 48:09.458
Hello.

48:10.666 --> 48:15.250
Uh, uh, fuck.

48:17.041 --> 48:19.083
[Kory grunting]

48:20.375 --> 48:21.958
Just leave you there.

48:23.083 --> 48:27.291
Um, um, um.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.833
Oh, Jesus, you're the man.

48:33.333 --> 48:34.500
[lid bangs]

48:35.958 --> 48:37.250
[tool clangs]

48:38.166 --> 48:40.333
[gentle suspenseful music]

48:41.083 --> 48:42.333
What the fuck?

48:44.833 --> 48:46.291
Jesus Christ, Faith.

48:48.916 --> 48:49.916
What?

48:51.958 --> 48:53.958
Make the pain go away, my ass.

48:57.541 --> 48:58.500
-[eerie tense music]
-[shutter clicks]

48:58.583 --> 49:00.791
[picture whirs]

49:00.875 --> 49:01.583
Idiot.

49:07.708 --> 49:11.666
[tense suspenseful music]

49:15.541 --> 49:16.541
Mine now.

49:19.500 --> 49:22.500
[dramatic tense music]

49:27.750 --> 49:29.291
[Kory yells]

49:32.458 --> 49:33.416
Okay.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.958
Shit, I got it.

49:39.333 --> 49:42.333
[dramatic tense music]

49:54.291 --> 49:55.250
[dishes clinking]

49:55.333 --> 49:58.291
[water splashing]

50:02.125 --> 50:03.083
[creature whooshing]

50:03.166 --> 50:04.583
[Kory grunts]

50:04.666 --> 50:08.125
Sorry. [gasps]

50:08.250 --> 50:11.208
[tense eerie music]

50:29.541 --> 50:32.541
[creature growling]

50:41.041 --> 50:43.166
[door squeaks]

50:43.250 --> 50:46.208
[dramatic tense music]

50:48.791 --> 50:51.708
Some, uh, [clears throat]

50:51.791 --> 50:52.791
it's a crazy day, huh?

50:53.958 --> 50:56.416
[Creature] Still early,
isn't it, buddy?

50:56.791 --> 51:00.083
Oh, oh, uh, you're, um.

51:00.541 --> 51:04.458
[Father] Charm's father,
man of the house. That's me.

51:05.750 --> 51:08.166
She didn't really, uh, she
didn't really mention you.

51:08.791 --> 51:12.666
[Father] Really? Sounds like
sour teenage grapes to me.

51:12.916 --> 51:15.291
[chuckles] Well, I wouldn't know

51:15.375 --> 51:16.958
I, um, I don't have any kids.

51:17.041 --> 51:19.000
[Father] Not yet,
but you got plenty

51:19.083 --> 51:22.166
of that pure white venom
just itching to get out.

51:22.250 --> 51:25.125
[inhales] I can
smell it from here.

51:25.208 --> 51:27.000
[creature laughing]

51:32.625 --> 51:35.625
[gentle tense music]

51:39.083 --> 51:42.125
[dramatic tense music]

51:58.833 --> 51:59.958
[Liz gasps]

52:10.916 --> 52:13.291
You know, I never
apologized t-, um,

52:13.375 --> 52:15.708
to you for sort of
just dropping in here.

52:15.791 --> 52:16.750
So sorry.

52:17.125 --> 52:19.041
[creature whooshing]

52:19.125 --> 52:21.083
[Kory breathing heavily]

52:21.166 --> 52:24.125
[gentle tense music]

52:28.125 --> 52:31.875
I should go back to bed. So,
um, sorry to wake you up here.

52:32.458 --> 52:33.416
[Father] Kory.

52:34.166 --> 52:37.083
[Kory] Yeah? [gasping]

52:40.750 --> 52:42.750
[Father] You've got
something of mine.

52:44.333 --> 52:46.333
I'm sorry. I, I wasn't gonna.

52:46.750 --> 52:47.708
[creature chittering]

52:47.791 --> 52:51.750
[dramatic tense music]

52:59.500 --> 53:00.791
[Father] Nighty-night.

53:00.875 --> 53:03.583
[Kory breathing heavily]

53:03.666 --> 53:05.041
[creature rumbling]

53:05.125 --> 53:07.500
[nails scraping]

53:08.583 --> 53:10.708
[Kory] What the fuck?

53:11.625 --> 53:13.041
[door squeaking]

53:15.041 --> 53:16.250
Don't go out there.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.208
I have to see her for myself.

53:18.291 --> 53:20.250
Trust me, hey. It's not safe.

53:20.541 --> 53:21.625
Well, maybe she's
not safe, either.

53:21.708 --> 53:23.166
Who fucking cares?

53:24.333 --> 53:26.416
That sickening lack of
empathy for your fellow man

53:26.500 --> 53:28.416
is gonna come for
you tenfold, brother,

53:28.541 --> 53:31.625
so do yourself a favour
and get with the program

53:32.083 --> 53:33.166
before it's too late.

53:33.250 --> 53:33.875
Move.

53:33.958 --> 53:36.541
[door squeaking]

53:36.625 --> 53:39.541
[Kory breathing heavily]

53:40.333 --> 53:44.666
[tense suspenseful music]

53:55.458 --> 53:58.458
[lights crackling]

54:05.916 --> 54:08.916
[dramatic tense music]

54:19.458 --> 54:23.416
[lights continue crackling]

54:31.958 --> 54:35.958
[dramatic tense
music continues]

54:50.333 --> 54:53.333
[Faith moaning]

54:55.833 --> 54:57.833
[door squeaks]

55:03.125 --> 55:04.291
Charm?

55:07.708 --> 55:10.708
It's me, Liz.

55:12.416 --> 55:13.666
-[shutter clicks]
-[Liz grunts]

55:13.750 --> 55:15.541
-[picture whirring]
-Yeah, I know where you are.

55:16.583 --> 55:18.250
Come to stare at
the basket case?

55:21.541 --> 55:23.875
Old school. Nice.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.875
Literally been in
hundreds of those things,

55:28.958 --> 55:30.791
but I still don't
understand how they work.

55:32.208 --> 55:34.291
Photo chemicals are basically
popped like a pimple

55:34.375 --> 55:37.000
onto a positive sheet
when the exposure exits.

55:37.875 --> 55:39.875
After that,
what you see is what you get

55:42.375 --> 55:43.708
or what you thought you saw.

55:45.708 --> 55:49.583
Mystery solved.
I brought you these.

55:50.583 --> 55:56.375
Th- they're very striking.
Thought you might want them.

55:59.750 --> 56:00.750
Liz, right?

56:04.875 --> 56:08.875
Last time I checked, there's
only one copy of that key.

56:12.458 --> 56:13.916
I had to see for myself.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.291
See what for yourself?

56:15.708 --> 56:17.875
That you weren't
here against your will.

56:18.916 --> 56:23.208
The seizure, the door,
the, the, the tunnel.

56:25.583 --> 56:26.541
The tunnel.

56:29.083 --> 56:30.291
Take my picture.

56:36.458 --> 56:37.458
Your home is odd.

56:39.291 --> 56:40.833
I've been keeping my eyes open.

56:41.916 --> 56:44.083
Usually there'll
be a sign somewhere.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.250
You know, a trinket, a symbol.

56:49.041 --> 56:50.291
Some evidence of-

56:50.375 --> 56:51.166
Evidence of what?

56:51.500 --> 56:57.083
-[shutter clicks]
-[picture whirring]

56:58.583 --> 56:59.583
Faith.

57:01.125 --> 57:08.125
Hmm. Value judgements from
the home invader, hmm?

57:09.791 --> 57:10.958
I'm sorry. I just...

57:15.458 --> 57:17.333
I- is there something

57:18.541 --> 57:21.958
that you wanna tell me
about your mother?

57:24.625 --> 57:27.833
I've seen situations
like this before.

57:28.791 --> 57:31.583
This isn't how real
protection works.

57:34.500 --> 57:35.500
What's there to tell?

57:37.791 --> 57:39.375
My mom thinks I
turn into a monster

57:39.458 --> 57:41.125
if I get too hot or too cold.

57:43.500 --> 57:44.458
Well, do you?

57:46.916 --> 57:48.416
[exhales] Joking.

57:50.000 --> 57:55.125
I really, your mother seemed
to have this overdeveloped

57:55.208 --> 57:58.458
sense of duty when it
comes to your health.

58:00.166 --> 58:04.291
Sometimes people want us to
think that their transgressions

58:04.375 --> 58:06.333
are powered by passion.

58:08.458 --> 58:10.333
Then what's actually
in the tank, hmm?

58:11.541 --> 58:15.916
I don't know. Guilt, maybe.

58:16.458 --> 58:21.083
[chuckles] You two sure seem
fascinated by the G word.

58:22.041 --> 58:24.250
I just wish we agreed
on its functions.

58:25.791 --> 58:28.458
Guilt is a stain
bestowed upon people

58:28.541 --> 58:31.041
who make the wrong decisions.

58:32.416 --> 58:36.416
It's the whole point. It's
what separates us from beasts.

58:41.041 --> 58:44.958
So if I really am a monster,

58:46.291 --> 58:48.625
my mom shouldn't feel
guilty for locking me up,

58:50.583 --> 58:55.500
tranquilized like a beast?

58:58.583 --> 59:03.666
Charm, I've seen monsters.

59:05.916 --> 59:07.875
You're not one of them.

59:07.958 --> 59:10.916
[gentle tense music]

59:17.416 --> 59:20.208
[heater humming]

59:22.041 --> 59:22.958
Charm.

59:23.041 --> 59:24.958
What you see is what you get.

59:28.083 --> 59:31.208
[Charm gasping]

59:40.666 --> 59:41.625
That's, that's enough.

59:41.708 --> 59:44.666
[Charm grunting]

59:50.708 --> 59:52.500
[blood squelching]

59:52.583 --> 59:54.666
[Charm screaming]

59:54.750 --> 59:56.625
[Charm groaning]

01:00:00.375 --> 01:00:01.375
[Liz] Charm!

01:00:01.833 --> 01:00:04.875
[creature rumbling]

01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:08.208
[creature growling]

01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:09.208
[blood squelching]

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:12.250
[creature roaring]

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:23.000
Charm! [gasping]

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:27.625
[tense eerie music]

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:35.041
[feet thudding]

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:39.125
[footsteps thudding]

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:43.125
[Liz crying]

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Hey, I don't know
what just happened.

01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:57.041
You don't have to tell me. But,
um, we obviously have to go.

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:04.791
[Liz crying]

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.625
I don't know what
the fuck that is.

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:13.166
[Liz] Look.

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:17.166
[dramatic intense music]

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:21.416
Listen, we're gonna get,

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.875
we're gonna get some blankets

01:01:22.958 --> 01:01:24.875
and then we're gonna steal
some food and then we go out

01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:27.125
the way we came in and we
just move faster than shit.

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:30.958
I can't. We can't.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:33.875
Hey, Lizzie. Hey,
hey, hey, Lizzie.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:36.416
I know you think you
can help these people.

01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:38.958
That's why you're,
you're amazing.

01:01:40.541 --> 01:01:42.833
Whatever's happening
in this house is so big

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:45.125
and dark that even a
fucking idiot like me

01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:46.750
knows you cannot pray it away.

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:47.875
We're all she has.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:50.791
Fuck, no, Liz! Pack your shit.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:55.500
Lizzie, I'll leave you.

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:03.333
Turning our back on
her would be a sin

01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:05.375
that dwarves all others.

01:02:06.958 --> 01:02:09.958
[gentle melancholy music]

01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:12.375
What do you wanna do?

01:02:20.708 --> 01:02:22.708
I wanna vanquish the demon.

01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:26.875
[dramatic tense music]

01:02:29.208 --> 01:02:31.916
The substitute compound is
making her more aggressive.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:40.333
