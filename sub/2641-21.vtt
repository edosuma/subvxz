WEBVTT

00:02.790 --> 00:04.357
Hold.

00:04.358 --> 00:05.325
What?

00:05.326 --> 00:06.959
Explain your sneeze.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.661
I'm sorry?

00:08.662 --> 00:10.396
Do you have allergies? No.

00:10.397 --> 00:11.930
Is there too much
pepper on your salad?

00:11.931 --> 00:13.065
I don't put pepper on salads.

00:13.066 --> 00:14.266
I've heard enough. Sit over there.

00:14.267 --> 00:16.768
Oh, come on.

00:16.769 --> 00:17.969
I don't want to sit by myself.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.139
That's what Typhoid Mary said,

00:19.140 --> 00:21.082
and clearly, her friends buckled.

00:21.083 --> 00:22.827
Guys, help me.

00:22.828 --> 00:24.028
Sheldon, come on.

00:24.029 --> 00:26.053
Yeah, it's just one sneeze.

00:26.054 --> 00:27.604
You're on your own. See you, buddy.

00:29.617 --> 00:31.404
Oh, Leonard,
I have something for you.

00:31.405 --> 00:33.862
Per our roommate agreement, this is

00:33.863 --> 00:36.062
your 24-hour notice
that I will be having

00:36.063 --> 00:39.446
a non-related female spending
two nights in our apartment.

00:41.219 --> 00:42.775
When you say "non-related female,"

00:42.776 --> 00:45.535
you still mean human, right?

00:45.536 --> 00:46.823
Of course.

00:46.824 --> 00:48.842
Pets are banned under
the roommate agreement,

00:48.843 --> 00:51.969
with the exception of service animals,
such as seeing eye dogs

00:51.970 --> 00:55.164
and, one day, cybernetically-
enhanced helper monkeys.

00:55.165 --> 00:59.429
Are you planning on
kidnapping a woman?

00:59.430 --> 01:00.770
Sarcasm?

01:00.771 --> 01:04.462
Yes, but mixed with
genuine concern.

01:04.462 --> 01:07.682
For your information,
I'll be playing host

01:07.683 --> 01:09.227
to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.

01:10.367 --> 01:11.874
The cosmological
physicist from Princeton?

01:11.875 --> 01:12.881
Yes.

01:12.882 --> 01:15.167
And until you acquire
a surgical mask,

01:15.168 --> 01:17.513
please address your comments
to me through a napkin.

01:18.854 --> 01:20.598
We've been corresponding
for years about

01:20.599 --> 01:21.870
our mutual interest in

01:21.871 --> 01:23.347
gravitational wave signatures

01:23.348 --> 01:25.358
of inflatons in the early universe.

01:25.359 --> 01:27.169
And now she's under consideration

01:27.170 --> 01:29.013
for a position at our university.

01:29.014 --> 01:31.724
Why didn't you tell me you
knew Elizabeth Plimpton?

01:31.725 --> 01:33.969
I am a huge fan of hers!

01:33.970 --> 01:36.316
I didn't realize I was obligated
to share my connection

01:36.317 --> 01:38.425
with things you're a fan of,
but very well.

01:38.426 --> 01:40.030
You enjoy Canadian bacon.

01:40.031 --> 01:41.806
I've been to Toronto.

01:41.807 --> 01:42.978
Okay, fine.

01:42.979 --> 01:44.320
Where is she going to sleep?

01:44.321 --> 01:46.462
My room, of course.

01:46.463 --> 01:47.633
Holy crap!

01:50.381 --> 01:52.721
Holy crap!

01:52.722 --> 01:55.097
Yeah, um, I have a
two-part question.

01:55.098 --> 01:56.101
Go ahead.

01:56.102 --> 01:57.606
A) Are you kidding me?

01:57.607 --> 02:01.011
And B) seriously,
are you freaking kidding me?

02:01.012 --> 02:03.243
A) I rarely kid.

02:03.244 --> 02:05.409
And B) when I do kid,
you will know it

02:05.410 --> 02:08.042
by my use of the word "bazinga."

02:08.043 --> 02:10.007
So you're saying the two of you

02:10.008 --> 02:12.483
are going to be sleeping
in the same bed?

02:12.484 --> 02:14.123
Yes.

02:14.124 --> 02:15.326
Bazinga.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.709
Leonard?

02:21.513 --> 02:23.452
Thank you.

02:23.453 --> 02:25.391
Why is a world- renowned scientist

02:25.392 --> 02:27.397
staying in our apartment
instead of a hotel?

02:27.398 --> 02:29.001
Well, she doesn't care for hotels.

02:29.002 --> 02:30.306
And who can blame her?

02:30.307 --> 02:31.376
Windows that don't open,

02:31.377 --> 02:32.912
multi-user linens,

02:32.913 --> 02:35.621
keys shaped like credit cards-
as if one walks around

02:35.622 --> 02:37.827
with unassigned slots
in one's wallet.

02:37.828 --> 02:39.199
All right, I believe I have time

02:39.200 --> 02:41.238
for one more question.

02:42.376 --> 02:43.978
Yes, Raj?

02:43.979 --> 02:45.917
When can I sit with you again?

02:45.918 --> 02:46.953
When I've seen

02:46.954 --> 02:48.592
two consecutive
negative throat cultures

02:48.593 --> 02:50.497
spaced 12 hours apart.
You know the drill.

02:50.498 --> 02:52.202
All right,

02:52.203 --> 02:54.241
if you'll excuse me,
I am off to start

02:54.242 --> 02:57.014
a prophylactic course
of antibiotics.

02:58.953 --> 03:01.893
I can't believe he's friends
with Elizabeth Plimpton.

03:01.894 --> 03:04.601
I can't believe they
let him into Canada.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.171
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You heard the man.

03:06.172 --> 03:07.709
Where's your throat cultures?

03:08.679 --> 03:10.717
Kidding. Sit down.

03:47.061 --> 03:47.661
Hey, Sheldon.

03:47.764 --> 03:49.532
Oh, Penny, excellent.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.801
I have a question
about these maxi pads.

03:52.802 --> 03:55.403
Are the wings truly functional

03:55.404 --> 03:58.072
or have I fallen victim
to marketing hype?

03:58.073 --> 03:59.206
What?

03:59.207 --> 04:01.842
Why are you doing with-- what?

04:01.843 --> 04:03.543
The stock boy at Walgreens

04:03.544 --> 04:05.645
was frustratingly
uninformed on the subject.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.514
Sheldon, what are you
doing with maxi pads?

04:08.515 --> 04:10.048
I have a lady friend

04:10.049 --> 04:12.217
who will be staying
with me for a few days.

04:12.218 --> 04:13.551
Oh.

04:13.552 --> 04:14.485
What?

04:14.486 --> 04:16.220
I want her to feel at home.

04:16.221 --> 04:20.322
I also bought scented soaps,
pantyhose, Midol,

04:20.324 --> 04:23.693
calcium chews and what
is apparently a yogurt

04:23.694 --> 04:26.929
specifically designed to
regulate the female bowel.

04:28.931 --> 04:30.365
Wait, wait, hold on, back up.

04:30.366 --> 04:32.333
You're having a
woman stay with you?

04:32.334 --> 04:33.367
Yes.

04:33.368 --> 04:35.369
Why does that seem to
flabbergast everybody?

04:35.370 --> 04:37.104
Oh... no, no, no, no.

04:37.105 --> 04:38.338
I'm not flabbergasted.

04:38.339 --> 04:39.939
I'm... puzzled.

04:39.940 --> 04:42.908
Yeah, let's go with puzzled.

04:42.909 --> 04:43.943
A word of warning.

04:43.944 --> 04:45.911
My guest is a noted physicist

04:45.912 --> 04:48.046
and the leading expert
on quantum cosmology,

04:48.047 --> 04:50.047
so please try to avoid
wasting her time

04:50.048 --> 04:53.416
with female jibber jabber.

04:53.417 --> 04:55.051
Female jibber jabber?

04:55.052 --> 04:56.385
Shoe sales, hair styles,

04:56.386 --> 05:00.521
mud masks, gossip about your
friends Brad and Angelina.

05:02.723 --> 05:04.089
Oh, they're not my friends.

05:04.090 --> 05:05.589
I'm not surprised,
considering the way

05:05.590 --> 05:07.560
you talk about them
behind their backs.

05:11.968 --> 05:12.902
She's here, she's here.

05:12.903 --> 05:15.103
How do I look? Do I look smart?

05:16.639 --> 05:17.939
Oh, good grief.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.374
This isn't about you.

05:19.375 --> 05:20.408
Coming!

05:20.409 --> 05:21.475
Now, listen.

05:21.476 --> 05:22.576
One of the great minds

05:22.577 --> 05:25.045
of the 21st century
is about to play host

05:25.046 --> 05:28.214
to one of the other great
minds of the 21st century.

05:28.215 --> 05:30.048
So pay attention.

05:30.049 --> 05:31.216
Years from now,

05:31.217 --> 05:34.652
my biographer might ask
you about this event.

05:34.653 --> 05:38.488
Oh, I have so many things
to tell your biographer.

05:39.723 --> 05:41.023
Dr. Cooper, thank goodness.

05:41.024 --> 05:42.924
I completely forgot your address.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.559
But then I remembered that
I'd written it on my hand.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.827
Lucky for me,

05:46.828 --> 05:48.395
I didn't confuse it
with what I'd written

05:48.396 --> 05:49.963
on my other hand,
which are the coordinates

05:49.964 --> 05:52.066
for a newly discovered
neutron star.

05:52.067 --> 05:54.968
'Cause if I tried to go there,
I'd be crushed by hypergravity.

05:56.103 --> 05:58.304
Anyway, hello. Hello.

05:58.305 --> 06:00.205
Nice to finally meet you in person.

06:00.206 --> 06:01.740
I would imagine it is.

06:04.377 --> 06:07.078
This is my friend and roommate, Dr.
Leonard Hofstadter.

06:07.079 --> 06:09.013
Hi-lo.

06:09.014 --> 06:10.181
Oops.

06:10.182 --> 06:11.651
I-I started to say "hi,"

06:11.652 --> 06:13.953
and then I switched to
"hello" in the middle.

06:13.954 --> 06:15.921
It came out "hi-lo."

06:16.689 --> 06:18.322
Duh.

06:18.323 --> 06:20.889
Uh, it's nice to meet you.

06:20.890 --> 06:23.325
I-I've read both your books
and most of your papers.

06:23.326 --> 06:27.129
I-I'm Leonard, I live here,
you're brilliant.

06:27.130 --> 06:28.197
I apologize.

06:28.198 --> 06:30.665
He's only an
experimental physicist.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.200
No need to apologize.

06:32.201 --> 06:34.902
Some of my best friends are
experimental physicists.

06:34.903 --> 06:35.903
Well, not

06:35.904 --> 06:37.905
my best friends, but I know them.

06:38.907 --> 06:39.840
My best friend is

06:39.841 --> 06:41.541
a molecular chemist named Wendy.

06:41.542 --> 06:43.543
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

06:43.544 --> 06:44.543
Hi-lo.

06:46.179 --> 06:47.146
Are you hungry, thirsty?

06:47.147 --> 06:48.311
Can I offer you anything?

06:48.312 --> 06:49.778
No, she's my guest.
If anyone should

06:49.779 --> 06:51.311
offer her anything,
it should be me.

06:51.312 --> 06:53.247
Elizabeth, can I get you something?

06:53.248 --> 06:54.782
Perhaps a feminine hygiene product

06:54.783 --> 06:57.450
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

06:57.451 --> 06:59.218
Interesting choices.

06:59.219 --> 07:02.087
Based on my current needs,
I guess I'd pick the yogurt.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.088
Excellent.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.422
If the yogurt works,

07:04.423 --> 07:07.224
I bought some delightful
scented candles.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.029
Look, it's you.

07:16.565 --> 07:19.500
Thank you so much for
opening up your home to me.

07:19.501 --> 07:22.569
Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?

07:22.570 --> 07:26.306
Windows that don't open,
those crazy card-shaped keys.

07:26.307 --> 07:27.742
I'm so glad you understand.

07:27.743 --> 07:30.144
No, he doesn't understand.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.178
I understand.

07:31.179 --> 07:32.380
Well, I understand, too.

07:32.381 --> 07:34.982
You're just misappropriating
my understanding.

07:34.983 --> 07:36.250
Oh...

07:37.218 --> 07:39.752
I think any university
would want you.

07:39.753 --> 07:40.853
Except, of course,

07:40.854 --> 07:42.589
any university that
had already had you.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.390
Because they would've
already wanted you

07:44.391 --> 07:46.525
before they, you know, got you.

07:47.827 --> 07:50.961
From the mind that
brought you "hi-lo."

07:52.363 --> 07:54.531
Let me show you to your room.

07:54.532 --> 07:55.632
All right.

07:55.633 --> 07:57.534
I guess I am tired.
Good night, Leonard.

07:57.535 --> 07:59.302
Uh, sleep night.

07:59.303 --> 08:00.904
I mean, obously, good night.

08:00.905 --> 08:02.204
I started to say "sleep tight,"

08:02.205 --> 08:04.137
then I changed my
mind in the middle.

08:04.138 --> 08:06.404
I swear to God, I'm smart.

08:09.241 --> 08:10.875
Get it together, man.

08:13.344 --> 08:16.112
All right, let me show you

08:16.113 --> 08:18.281
some of the features of the room.

08:18.282 --> 08:19.882
First, windows.

08:19.883 --> 08:20.883
Conventional.

08:20.884 --> 08:22.518
Open, closed.

08:22.519 --> 08:23.819
Open, closed.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.253
Halfway open.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.989
Or halfway closed, depending
on your philosophical bent.

08:29.124 --> 08:31.058
Over here is my comic
book collection.

08:31.059 --> 08:32.292
Feel free to browse.

08:32.293 --> 08:34.394
There's a box of
disposable reading gloves

08:34.395 --> 08:36.863
on the night stand.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.364
Good to know.

08:38.365 --> 08:39.698
In here, you'll find

08:39.698 --> 08:41.799
emergency provisions.

08:41.801 --> 08:44.836
An eight-day supply of
food and water, a crossbow,

08:44.837 --> 08:47.638
season two of <i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>The Original Series</i>

08:47.639 --> 08:49.440
on a high-density flash drive.

08:50.175 --> 08:51.441
What if there's a disaster

08:51.442 --> 08:53.309
that destroys all the USB ports?

08:53.310 --> 08:56.212
Then there's really no
reason to live, is there?

08:56.213 --> 08:59.047
Can I ask a question
about your roommate?

08:59.048 --> 09:01.783
He's an odd duck, isn't he?

09:01.784 --> 09:03.951
What's his relationship status?

09:03.952 --> 09:06.887
Well, there was a
misbegotten adventure

09:06.888 --> 09:09.123
with a waitress who
lives across the hall.

09:09.124 --> 09:11.391
It ended as inexplicably
as it began.

09:11.392 --> 09:13.126
They had very little in common,

09:13.127 --> 09:14.927
except for carnal activity.

09:14.928 --> 09:15.995
That's why I acquired

09:15.996 --> 09:18.464
these noise-canceling headphones.

09:18.465 --> 09:20.299
If you decide to use them,

09:20.300 --> 09:22.067
please clean the ear
pieces afterwards

09:22.068 --> 09:24.202
with the Wet Wipes you'll
find in the bathroom.

09:24.203 --> 09:26.671
They're in the drawer
labeled "Wet Wipes."

09:26.672 --> 09:28.039
Okay.

09:28.040 --> 09:28.939
Good. I'll leave you

09:28.940 --> 09:30.941
to your nighttime ablutions.

09:30.942 --> 09:33.176
I've e-mailed you the
morning bathroom schedule.

09:33.177 --> 09:36.913
You'll also find a laminated
copy in your welcome packet.

09:38.482 --> 09:41.251
It's on the back of the
emergency escape route diagram.

09:41.252 --> 09:42.285
How thoughtful.

09:42.286 --> 09:44.487
Sleep well, my friend. You, too.

09:45.322 --> 09:48.724
Oh, let me just get one thing.

09:48.725 --> 09:51.226
It's my backup
emergency supply kit.

09:51.227 --> 09:54.529
The living room escape route
doesn't pass through here.

09:54.530 --> 09:55.764
Now, good night.

09:55.765 --> 09:58.232
And if there's an apocalypse,
good luck.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.303
Yes?

10:05.304 --> 10:08.205
I saw your light on.

10:08.206 --> 10:09.473
Is everything all right?

10:09.474 --> 10:11.341
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

10:11.342 --> 10:13.176
Me neither.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.877
Oh, look what I'm reading.

10:14.878 --> 10:16.612
It's you.

10:16.613 --> 10:18.247
I thought you already read it.

10:18.248 --> 10:19.648
I did, but it's been a while,

10:19.649 --> 10:23.218
and I wanted to sound
smart over breakfast.

10:23.219 --> 10:25.219
Aw, you're smart.

10:25.220 --> 10:26.286
Oh, good.

10:26.287 --> 10:27.854
Wasn't sure it was coming across.

10:27.855 --> 10:30.190
What chapter are you on?

10:30.191 --> 10:31.724
Uh, six.

10:31.725 --> 10:35.726
Oh, the extragalactic
distance ladder.

10:35.727 --> 10:37.327
Want to know a little secret?

10:37.328 --> 10:39.062
Sure.

10:39.063 --> 10:40.964
I wrote the section on
the Wilson-Bappu Effect

10:40.965 --> 10:42.631
completely naked.

10:45.468 --> 10:47.570
Really?

10:47.571 --> 10:49.807
Uh, sure doesn't read that way.

10:49.808 --> 10:51.777
Here, let me show yo

10:53.881 --> 10:56.349
When we consider the brightness
of pulsating variable stars,

10:56.350 --> 10:57.516
we start to see

10:57.517 --> 11:00.319
a possible explanation for
some of the discrepancies

11:00.320 --> 11:03.288
found in Hubble's constant.

11:03.289 --> 11:06.557
Wow.

11:06.558 --> 11:09.626
You really make science come alive.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:31.098 --> 11:33.300
Vocal test. Morning vocal test.

11:34.581 --> 11:35.748
Second vocal test.

11:35.749 --> 11:37.483
Second morning vocal test.

11:37.484 --> 11:38.985
Morning, Sheldon.

11:38.986 --> 11:40.019
Morning.

11:40.020 --> 11:41.053
Morning, Sheldon.

11:41.054 --> 11:41.987
Morning.

11:41.988 --> 11:43.488
I trust you had a pleasant night.

11:43.489 --> 11:44.622
More than pleasant.

11:49.994 --> 11:53.231
Excuse me, I'm going
to relieve myself.

11:54.433 --> 11:55.900
How do you take your coffee?

11:55.901 --> 11:57.935
Black. Okeydoke.

12:00.272 --> 12:02.439
Pee for Houston, pee for Austin,

12:02.440 --> 12:05.609
pee for the state my
heart got lost in.

12:08.345 --> 12:11.246
And shake twice for Texas.

12:15.551 --> 12:18.719
Something his mother taught him.

12:19.821 --> 12:21.388
All right, Elizabeth,

12:21.389 --> 12:22.955
the bathroom is yours.

12:22.956 --> 12:26.258
The seat is down, and has been
sanitized for your protection.

12:26.259 --> 12:29.227
That's very thoughtful,
but I think I'll finish my coffee first.

12:30.395 --> 12:33.363
Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.

12:33.364 --> 12:34.931
I'll fire off

12:34.932 --> 12:37.733
a critical e-mail
to the manufacturer.

12:37.734 --> 12:38.800
Oh, good, you're up.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.168
Look, my car won't start.

12:40.169 --> 12:41.402
I need a ride to work.

12:41.403 --> 12:43.770
Did you once again ignore
your "check engine" light?

12:43.771 --> 12:45.372
No, Mr. smarty-pants.

12:45.373 --> 12:48.107
I ignored the "fill
gas tank" light.

12:48.108 --> 12:51.643
Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any
residual feelings you have for her

12:51.644 --> 12:53.579
in order to get a ride to work.

12:53.580 --> 12:56.615
Oh, yeah, sure, let me just
put this in a travel mug.

12:56.616 --> 12:58.149
Hello.

12:58.150 --> 12:59.417
Hi.

12:59.418 --> 13:01.919
Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton--

13:01.920 --> 13:04.687
a leading expert on
quantum cosmology.

13:04.688 --> 13:06.555
Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress

13:06.556 --> 13:08.757
who doesn't understand
the role gasoline plays

13:08.758 --> 13:10.858
in the internal combustion engine.

13:10.859 --> 13:12.994
Nice to meet you.

13:12.995 --> 13:13.995
Nice to meet you, too.

13:13.996 --> 13:15.129
Are you enjoying your stay?

13:15.130 --> 13:16.797
Yes, very much.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.968
Good.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.105
Wonderful. Meaningless
pleasantries accomplished.

13:25.106 --> 13:26.807
Elizabeth, Leonard's
bathroom time is coming up,

13:26.808 --> 13:29.209
and believe me,
you do not want to follow him.

13:29.210 --> 13:31.745
Excuse me.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.081
Okay, well, I guess
I should get dressed

13:35.082 --> 13:36.681
so I can take everyone to work.

13:36.682 --> 13:37.882
You and Sheldon

13:37.883 --> 13:38.983
and Sheldon's friend,

13:38.984 --> 13:40.717
Dr. Plimpton, who you just met.

13:40.718 --> 13:42.385
Gonna be fun.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.553
Like a clown car.

13:44.554 --> 13:45.587
Hang on. Hmm?

13:45.588 --> 13:47.255
Yeah? What? Huh?

13:47.256 --> 13:48.923
We just broke up.

13:48.924 --> 13:50.124
Wha-- uh, you and me? Yeah, we did.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.092
Not too long ago.

13:51.093 --> 13:52.893
How are you doing with it?

13:52.894 --> 13:55.061
Not as good as you apparently.

13:55.062 --> 13:56.563
I, um, I don't follow.

13:56.564 --> 13:58.199
You know what? It's,
it's none of my business.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.168
If you want to sleep with
Sheldon's doctor buddy

14:00.169 --> 14:02.470
right after we stopped
seeing each other, go for it.

14:02.471 --> 14:04.305
Well, now... Excuse me.

14:04.306 --> 14:07.107
I'm uncomfortable
with you recommending

14:07.108 --> 14:09.609
that Leonard pursue having
intercourse with Dr. Plimpton,

14:09.610 --> 14:13.179
who I assure you has
better things to do.

14:13.180 --> 14:14.314
I'm not recommending it.

14:14.315 --> 14:16.249
I'm saying it already happened.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.716
That's preposterous.

14:17.717 --> 14:19.718
Tell her, Leonard.

14:19.719 --> 14:22.586
Well...

14:24.589 --> 14:26.523
No.

14:26.524 --> 14:28.525
Come on. It wasn't my fault.

14:28.526 --> 14:31.228
The implication being
that you sow tripped

14:31.229 --> 14:35.097
and fell into her lady parts?

14:35.098 --> 14:36.398
You know what?

14:36.399 --> 14:38.033
I'm just gonna take
the bus to work.

14:38.034 --> 14:39.334
Penny, I can still drive you.

14:39.335 --> 14:40.402
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

14:40.403 --> 14:42.036
You might slip on a banana peel

14:42.037 --> 14:43.771
and get me pregnant.

14:44.606 --> 14:46.307
I must say,

14:46.308 --> 14:48.442
I'm ocked by this betrayal.

14:48.443 --> 14:49.976
I didn't betray Penny.

14:49.977 --> 14:52.411
Not Penny, me!

14:52.412 --> 14:54.079
How am I betraying you?

14:54.080 --> 14:57.249
izabeth's my friend,
and you're playingith her!

15:00.786 --> 15:03.988
Yeah, I guess I did.

15:10.361 --> 15:11.795
What the hell are you doing?

15:11.796 --> 15:14.396
Relax, it's Nyquil.

15:14.397 --> 15:16.264
You still have a cold?

15:16.265 --> 15:17.999
Maybe, but I don't care.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.133
That's the great thing

15:19.134 --> 15:22.069
about Nyquil,
it's like ten-percent booze.

15:22.070 --> 15:24.738
I call it the nighttime sniffling,
sneezing, coughing

15:24.739 --> 15:27.874
so you can talk to girls medicine.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.542
Are you having trouble sleeping?

15:29.543 --> 15:32.277
'Cause, boy, I was up all night.

15:32.278 --> 15:33.845
Did you get a cold, too?

15:33.846 --> 15:37.582
No, but I was awake all night.

15:39.351 --> 15:40.918
If you want,

15:40.919 --> 15:44.955
I can give you some of
my mom's sleeping pills.

15:44.956 --> 15:45.955
She won't notice they're missing?

15:45.956 --> 15:48.024
She doesn't kn she takes them.

15:49.193 --> 15:50.293
No, that's okay.

15:50.294 --> 15:53.261
It was something else
keeping me up last night.

15:53.262 --> 15:55.196
And again this morning.

15:55.197 --> 15:58.031
And... I didn't mind.

16:01.468 --> 16:03.469
I was up last night.

16:03.470 --> 16:05.370
I was up this morning.

16:05.371 --> 16:07.339
I didn't mind.

16:07.340 --> 16:09.541
Those are your clues.

16:12.411 --> 16:14.044
Ooh, ooh.

16:14.045 --> 16:17.047
Did the pigeon on your
windowsill have more babies?

16:17.048 --> 16:18.781
No.

16:18.782 --> 16:21.450
Were you up mang another
stop-motion Legoovie?

16:21.451 --> 16:22.918
No.

16:22.919 --> 16:24.219
'Cause let me tell you,

16:24.220 --> 16:25.754
it's not enough to
make the Legos move,

16:25.755 --> 16:27.956
they also have to
capture your heart.

16:27.957 --> 16:29.991
Okay, I'll give you one more clue.

16:29.992 --> 16:32.426
It involved another person.

16:32.427 --> 16:35.662
did you get a Japanese love pillow?

16:36.798 --> 16:39.899
How is a Japanese love
pillow another person?

16:39.900 --> 16:43.569
It is if you love her
and give her a name.

16:43.570 --> 16:47.105
Dr. Plimpton, I'd like you
to meet my colleagues--

16:47.106 --> 16:48.773
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali

16:48.774 --> 16:50.842
Hi. and not-a-doctor
Howard Wolowitz.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.976
Hi.

16:51.977 --> 16:54.678
I'm a big fan of your work.
Thank you.

16:54.679 --> 16:56.280
And of course, you've
already introduced yourself

16:56.281 --> 16:58.883
to Dr. Hofstadter.

16:58.884 --> 17:00.284
Hey, you.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.418
Hey, you.

17:01.419 --> 17:04.186
Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out.

17:04.188 --> 17:05.955
How are you feeling, Elizabeth?

17:05.957 --> 17:07.190
You know what?

17:07.191 --> 17:08.592
I am a little tired.

17:08.593 --> 17:11.161
Would you be a dear and
get me a cup of coffee?

17:11.162 --> 17:12.663
Sure.

17:12.664 --> 17:13.998
Black, right?

17:13.999 --> 17:17.134
Actually, now I think I want it hot,
brown and sweet.

17:18.002 --> 17:19.202
Coming right up.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.538
What?

17:26.539 --> 17:28.471
What do you mean "what?
" It's Halo night.

17:28.472 --> 17:30.104
I can't. I'm too sick.

17:30.105 --> 17:31.336
Go away.

17:31.337 --> 17:34.839
That's why we moved
Halo night here.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.473
Look, I brought my
mom's chicken soup.

17:36.474 --> 17:37.608
I'm not hungry.

17:37.609 --> 17:38.909
Don't send him away.

17:38.910 --> 17:40.410
Let him in. Who's that

17:40.411 --> 17:42.612
I bought a parrot.

17:44.948 --> 17:47.049
Yeah, right.

17:48.584 --> 17:50.051
Dr. Plimpton?

17:50.052 --> 17:51.586
Hi. Howard, right?

17:51.587 --> 17:53.254
Uh, yeah.

17:53.255 --> 17:55.255
Can I ask you a question, Howard?

17:55.256 --> 17:57.557
Do you like role-playing games?

17:58.425 --> 18:01.194
Yeah, sure.

18:01.195 --> 18:04.296
In fact, I'm a dungeon master.

18:04.297 --> 18:05.564
Not tonight.

18:05.565 --> 18:08.632
Tonight you are a delivery man.

18:08.633 --> 18:10.000
You brought soup,

18:10.001 --> 18:12.602
but uh-oh, Raj and I don't
have enough money to pay you.

18:12.603 --> 18:16.172
So we'll have to come to some
other kind of arrangement.

18:20.510 --> 18:22.544
Beg your pardon?

18:22.545 --> 18:24.312
You two figure out the details,

18:24.313 --> 18:25.780
I'm going to go
change into something

18:25.781 --> 18:29.016
I don't mind getting
ripped off my milky flesh.

18:31.085 --> 18:33.286
What the frak?

18:33.287 --> 18:34.787
Go away.

18:34.788 --> 18:37.556
She wants New Delhi,
not Kosher deli.

18:37.557 --> 18:39.957
Besides, you have a girlfriend.

18:39.958 --> 18:41.593
We broke up weeks ago.

18:41.594 --> 18:43.594
Why didn't you say anything?

18:43.595 --> 18:45.062
I was waiting for the right time.

18:45.063 --> 18:46.463
This is the right time.

18:47.431 --> 18:49.199
Hey, who's ready for Halo?

18:49.200 --> 18:50.666
Oh, this is like a nightmare.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.969
Get lost!

18:52.970 --> 18:55.304
He's right. The numbers
are shaky enough as it is.

18:55.305 --> 18:56.772
I don't understand.

18:56.773 --> 18:58.074
Oh, good.

18:58.075 --> 18:59.642
Leonard's here.

18:59.643 --> 19:01.210
Good?!

19:01.211 --> 19:02.377
Elizabeth?

19:02.378 --> 19:03.712
What's going on?

19:03.713 --> 19:07.048
What's going on is you and
Howard are my moving men

19:07.049 --> 19:08.682
and Raj is my new landlord

19:08.683 --> 19:11.517
and I don't have enough
money to pay any of you.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.856
Is she suggesting what I
think she's suggesting?

19:16.857 --> 19:17.790
Yep.

19:17.791 --> 19:20.493
Welcome to the <i>Penthouse Forum.</i>

19:20.494 --> 19:22.527
Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?

19:23.529 --> 19:25.931
We'll all be naked in
front of each other.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.666
I'm out.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.301
Everybody ready?

19:31.403 --> 19:32.870
Follow my lead.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.672
Almost.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.640
We're, we're going to go out

19:35.641 --> 19:36.841
into the hallway and, uh,

19:36.842 --> 19:38.208
make a dramatic entrance.

19:38.209 --> 19:41.008
Oh, good. It's so much
better when everyone commits.

19:41.009 --> 19:42.974
Run. Run, run, run.
Don't look back.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.175
I thought we had something special.

19:50.247 --> 19:52.648
So, you say you can't
pay your rent...

20:01.584 --> 20:02.317
Oh, Leonard?

20:02.374 --> 20:02.874
Hey.

20:02.959 --> 20:04.292
I found these in the dryer.

20:04.293 --> 20:06.627
I'm assuming they
belong to Sheldon.

20:06.628 --> 20:08.095
Thanks.

20:08.096 --> 20:11.164
It's really hard to
find these in his size.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.500
So, listen.

20:13.501 --> 20:16.435
I've been meaning to talk to
you about the other morning.

20:16.436 --> 20:19.538
You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?

20:19.539 --> 20:21.806
Yeah, I wanted to explain

20:21.807 --> 20:23.841
Well, you don't owe
me an explanation.

20:23.842 --> 20:24.876
I don't?

20:24.877 --> 20:26.110
No, you don't.

20:26.111 --> 20:27.878
So you're not judging me?

20:27.879 --> 20:29.880
Oh, I'm judging you
nine ways to Sunday,

20:29.881 --> 20:33.149
but you don't owe
me an explanation.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.551
Nevertheless, I'd like
to get one on the record

20:35.552 --> 20:38.020
so you can understand
why I did what I did.

20:38.021 --> 20:39.188
I'm listening.

20:39.189 --> 20:42.923

She let me.
