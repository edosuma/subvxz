<i>... believeth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i>

01:41.823 --> 01:43.899
Charity never faileth.

01:43.992 --> 01:47.941
But whether there be prophecies,
they shall fail,

01:48.037 --> 01:51.572
whether there be tongues,
they shall cease,

01:51.666 --> 01:55.616
whether there be knowledge,
it shall vanish away.

01:55.712 --> 02:00.338
For we know in part
and we prophesy in part,

02:00.425 --> 02:03.794
but when that which is perfect is come,

02:03.886 --> 02:07.836
then that which is in part shall be done away.

02:07.932 --> 02:11.432
When I was a child, I spake as a child,

02:11.519 --> 02:15.433
I understood as a child, I thought as a child.

02:15.523 --> 02:20.518
But when I became a man,
I put away childish things.

02:20.612 --> 02:26.401
For now we see through a glass darkly,
but then face to face.

02:26.492 --> 02:33.029
Now I know in part, but then shall I know
even as also I am known.

02:33.124 --> 02:37.585
And now abideth
faith, hope, charity, these three,

02:37.670 --> 02:41.620
but the greatest of these is charity.

03:52.370 --> 03:59.286
No call to arms has ever gone unheeded
by a graduate of Bunker Hill Academy.

04:00.336 --> 04:04.334
In defence of our country and her principles,
many of our brothers

04:04.424 --> 04:09.762
have nobly and selflessly
made the ultimate sacrifice.

04:09.846 --> 04:13.630
To honour them, we will close
this baccalaureate service

04:13.725 --> 04:16.050
as we close all services here,

04:16.144 --> 04:21.101
by reading from the book of remembrance.

04:25.945 --> 04:30.524
This will be the last reading
of the book for this year.

- Brian, Dungeons and Dragons tonight?
- Not tonight, Shawn.

07:00.850 --> 07:03.341
Nice of you to ask.

07:03.436 --> 07:05.227
Have a good day.

07:05.313 --> 07:08.848
<i>Billy, who are you
rooming with next summer?</i>

07:08.941 --> 07:10.484
Attention!

07:10.568 --> 07:13.355
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

07:17.992 --> 07:20.566
Larry, what troop are you in next year, D or F?

07:20.662 --> 07:23.532
- Keep it down!
- >I'm in F.

07:23.623 --> 07:26.540
All right! I got into Company A!

07:29.921 --> 07:31.997
<i>Attention!</i>

07:37.720 --> 07:41.006
<i>Boy, I'm not gonna miss your socks...</i>

07:48.564 --> 07:53.108
- How's the T-shirt, Pigpen?
- Turn it out, Pigpen.

07:56.531 --> 07:58.607
Outstanding.

07:59.784 --> 08:02.275
As you were, gentlemen.

08:02.370 --> 08:03.449
Phew!

08:03.538 --> 08:06.111
Oh, God, thank you!

08:07.917 --> 08:11.037
- Hey, Brian. You seen Shovel?
- Not since morning.

08:11.129 --> 08:15.043
He got this summer care package
from his mother. One-way douche bag hid it.

08:15.133 --> 08:17.291
<i>The thing's the size of a Volkswagen.</i>

08:17.385 --> 08:20.635
Home-made fudge,
carrot cake, date nut bread.

08:20.722 --> 08:23.888
I'm hot on the trail of that sucker.
When I see him, I'll...

08:23.975 --> 08:26.382
Hey, Shovel!

08:26.477 --> 08:29.312
Come here with that food!

08:29.397 --> 08:31.686
Sorry, Hulk.

08:42.159 --> 08:45.161
Want me to touch up your shoes, sir?

08:46.247 --> 08:51.039
I mean, you won't want to go to the general's
with your shoes all grungy.

08:53.212 --> 08:57.080
You know what
I'm gonna hate next year, Charlie?

08:57.175 --> 09:00.129
- Breaking in a new plebe.
- Yeah.

09:01.763 --> 09:03.672
Yes, sir.

09:08.686 --> 09:10.762
Zen is no laughing matter.

09:12.565 --> 09:14.641
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on.

09:14.734 --> 09:16.810
Thank you, sir.

09:21.491 --> 09:22.949
Four, five, six.

09:23.034 --> 09:29.748
I can never hear that sequence of numbers
without feeling a rush in my blood.

09:30.583 --> 09:34.034
The siege itself
was almost as bad as the assaults,

09:34.128 --> 09:38.541
and the assaults were out of this world.
They kept coming at us, wave after wave.

09:38.633 --> 09:44.220
Totally indifferent to casualties. The Chinese
always had plenty of bodies to spare.

09:44.305 --> 09:49.975
They seemed to be fascinated
with our Springfield 1903.

09:50.061 --> 09:52.599
The rifle our snipers used.

09:52.689 --> 09:56.188
They called it the weapon of the silent death.

09:56.276 --> 10:00.320
I wish I could remember that phrase
in Chinese. It was rather beautiful.

10:00.405 --> 10:04.485
In battle, sir,
how do you keep from being scared?

10:06.994 --> 10:10.280
You don't. My God, was I scared!

10:10.373 --> 10:13.457
I must have lost about 20 pounds,
all of it brown!

10:14.460 --> 10:20.380
But fear has a way
of providing you with a little bonus.

10:20.466 --> 10:24.416
It gives you... the wolf.

10:28.141 --> 10:30.762
The wolf?

10:30.852 --> 10:35.514
It's a quotation from Theodore Roosevelt.
Let me see.

10:35.606 --> 10:41.277
"All men who have felt the power
of the joy of battle

10:41.362 --> 10:45.858
know what it's like
when the wolf rises in the heart."

10:47.035 --> 10:52.539
He knew and I know
that man was meant to be a warrior.

10:52.623 --> 10:56.206
We're all sons of our Viking fathers.

10:57.795 --> 11:01.081
Try to eat a little something,
just to keep up appearances.

11:01.174 --> 11:04.128
Otherwise I'll get an earache from Mrs Malloy.

11:04.218 --> 11:06.923
It's delicious, sir.

11:07.013 --> 11:10.797
I don't imagine I had much appetite
when I was appointed cadet major.

11:10.892 --> 11:16.432
My God. Can't be 45 years ago.
Nobody's that old.

11:17.482 --> 11:20.317
Wasn't General Black commander then, sir?

11:20.401 --> 11:23.188
- General Black?
- Yes. Yes, General Black.

11:23.279 --> 11:28.155
We cadets used to say
that his name described his heart.

11:28.242 --> 11:32.110
But we respected the hell out of him.
He went the whole nine yards.

11:32.205 --> 11:38.077
It didn't matter whether it was war
or growing roses or making men.

11:38.169 --> 11:40.707
You know that picture of him
in the admin building?

11:40.797 --> 11:43.833
When I was a plebe
it used to scare me walking under it.

11:43.925 --> 11:46.250
<i>That's why they hung it there.</i>

11:46.344 --> 11:50.294
The truth is you would have loved him
like a father. I know I did.

11:50.390 --> 11:54.850
Speaking of fathers, Mr Moreland,
is your dad still at Fort Benning?

11:54.936 --> 11:57.687
No, sir, he's at Fort Polk now.

11:57.772 --> 12:02.434
Well, a good top sergeant
is worth his weight in gold.

12:02.527 --> 12:06.145
I know many a colonel who's had
his ass saved by a clever sergeant.

12:06.239 --> 12:08.777
Excuse me, Mrs Malloy.

12:08.866 --> 12:11.536
I'm sure he's very proud of you, son.

12:11.619 --> 12:14.193
- I hope he is, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

12:15.832 --> 12:20.043
My doctor allows me one of these a day.
This is my third.

12:20.128 --> 12:25.584
I wish I could tell you that there are more old
generals than old doctors, but it's not true.

12:25.675 --> 12:31.345
Mrs Malloy, my officers and I
will have coffee and brandy in the study.

12:31.431 --> 12:33.507
Gentlemen?

12:39.230 --> 12:42.314
I'm afraid I can't vouch for the vintage,

12:42.400 --> 12:46.148
but ultimately
it is the company that counts, isn't it?

12:46.237 --> 12:49.238
So, what shall we drink to?

12:49.324 --> 12:53.404
I tell you what. Let's drink
to the one thing that never changes.

12:53.494 --> 12:56.246
To the one permanent part of a man's life.

12:56.331 --> 12:59.166
- What's that, sir?
- Honour.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.326
Honour, indeed.

13:01.419 --> 13:07.042
Burglarproof, foolproof, weatherproof.
100 proof. Honour.

13:07.133 --> 13:11.427
Everything else
is subject to the powers that be,

13:11.512 --> 13:16.388
dependent upon the caprices
of often inferior men.

13:16.476 --> 13:20.687
But your honour is your own, inviolate.

13:20.772 --> 13:23.441
So, then. To honour.

13:23.524 --> 13:25.813
- To honour.
- To honour.

13:31.824 --> 13:35.489
Well, drink up. We have things to do.

13:35.828 --> 13:38.035
Bunker Hill is rich in ceremony,

13:38.122 --> 13:41.823
but this is an occasion
I always like to keep rather private,

13:41.918 --> 13:47.458
when I say goodbye to one major
and appoint another in his place.

13:47.548 --> 13:51.842
The cadet major
is outranked militarily only by me,

13:51.928 --> 13:54.763
so that makes it a position
of some responsibility.

13:54.847 --> 13:58.382
- You'll attest to that, won't you, Cooper?
- I'm afraid I can.

13:58.476 --> 14:01.810
Captain Moreland, like your predecessor

14:01.896 --> 14:06.605
you've distinguished yourself for a number
of years here as an underclassman.

14:06.693 --> 14:10.108
And in recognition
of your scholarship and leadership,

14:10.196 --> 14:13.197
your exemplary character,

14:13.282 --> 14:16.948
I take pleasure in conferring upon you
the rank of cadet major

14:17.036 --> 14:20.286
with all the responsibilities
and privileges of that rank.

14:20.373 --> 14:24.418
Now, they'll respect the rank.

14:24.502 --> 14:28.998
But God knows they won't
respect the man unless he earns it.

14:29.090 --> 14:34.546
And the loyalty of men is always hard-earned.

14:34.637 --> 14:37.342
- I'll do my best, sir.
- I have every confidence in you.

14:37.432 --> 14:39.887
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Brian.

14:39.976 --> 14:42.811
- Don't make me look too bad in comparison.
- Don't worry.

14:42.895 --> 14:47.937
John, if you do half as well at West Point as
you have here, you'll make a splendid officer.

14:48.026 --> 14:51.644
Thank you, sir. The credit would go to you.

14:51.738 --> 14:55.866
If you wouldn't mind accompanying me
to the administration building,

14:55.950 --> 15:00.197
I have my annual battle of the paperclips

15:00.288 --> 15:02.861
with the board of trustees.

15:13.468 --> 15:15.377
Entirely adequate.

15:15.470 --> 15:18.257
Don't ask me what we had for dinner.
Can't remember.

15:18.348 --> 15:22.891
- We had this stuff in some green liquid.
- We had brandy. Brandy with the general.

15:22.977 --> 15:25.349
- Incredible.
- Do you even like brandy?

15:25.438 --> 15:28.973
That's beside the point. Can't stand it.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.640
They're beautiful, roomie. You earned them.

15:31.736 --> 15:34.192
Yeah. You deserve them as much as I do.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.741
No way, José. I'm half-civilian,
you know, on my mother's side.

15:38.826 --> 15:41.863
Even if I did get you through math, science,

15:41.955 --> 15:44.327
- Military science...
- True. Very true.

15:44.415 --> 15:45.696
Did you get 'em?

15:45.792 --> 15:50.335
Whatever happened to good manners?
The simple custom of knocking...

15:50.421 --> 15:54.289
The gold.
I'd give my right nut for those oak leaves.

15:54.384 --> 15:58.333
Does a major live at this address?
Can I touch 'em? Please?

15:58.429 --> 16:02.047
- Man, I can't believe it!
- Don't cream on 'em. They'll tarnish.

16:02.141 --> 16:05.557
You should have been there.
We talked about battles he'd been in.

16:05.645 --> 16:07.472
- No shit!
- Drank brandy.

16:07.563 --> 16:09.188
- No shit!
- Toasted honour.

16:09.273 --> 16:11.729
You can tell your grandchildren about it.

16:11.818 --> 16:15.483
Listen. We are gonna have such a great year.
The best year yet.

16:15.571 --> 16:19.106
We are gonna command the best regiment
this school has ever seen.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.358
Damn well said!

16:21.452 --> 16:25.284
In honour of this auspicious occasion,
Major Moreland,

16:25.373 --> 16:28.540
your presence is requested in the hallway.

17:24.973 --> 17:27.050
Dismissed!

17:29.645 --> 17:31.971
<i>Major Moreland, he's our man.</i>

17:32.065 --> 17:34.390
Major Moreland, he's our man.

17:34.484 --> 17:36.690
He's the baddest in the land.

17:36.778 --> 17:40.360
- He's the baddest in the land.
- Thank you, Dave.

17:40.448 --> 17:42.524
Thank you. Thanks.

17:42.617 --> 17:45.534
That was a nice thing to do, Shawn.
I mean it.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.494
Thanks.

19:12.624 --> 19:16.752
<i>The corps of cadets
is commanded by Major John Cooper.</i>

19:21.132 --> 19:25.379
<i>The incoming corps commander
is Major Brian Moreland.</i>

20:23.736 --> 20:27.604
<i>B Company is led by
Cadet Captain David Shawn.</i>

20:27.699 --> 20:29.940
Eyes right!

20:44.507 --> 20:45.882
Eyes right!

20:45.967 --> 20:50.261
<i>A Company is led by Cadet Captain JC Pierce.</i>

20:58.312 --> 21:00.685
Company, turn!

21:07.739 --> 21:12.733
<i>C Company is led by
Cadet Captain Robert Harris.</i>

21:14.620 --> 21:16.993
Eyes right!

21:31.262 --> 21:36.849
<i>- D Troop is led by Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer.
- Eyes right!</i>

21:48.696 --> 21:51.899
Present arms!

21:54.577 --> 21:58.575
Staff, present arms.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.585
Stand at ease!

22:04.671 --> 22:07.375
Staff, stand at ease.

22:07.465 --> 22:10.170
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:10.259 --> 22:16.132
for 141 years, old soldiers like myself
have stood here on this day

22:16.224 --> 22:19.557
and told the finest of America's young men

22:19.644 --> 22:23.013
the meaning of the word "commencement".

22:23.106 --> 22:25.857
It is a beginning, we told them.

22:25.942 --> 22:28.018
But today,

22:29.362 --> 22:31.687
this day,

22:31.781 --> 22:35.446
it has another meaning, an end.

22:35.535 --> 22:39.579
An end to nearly
a century and a half of tradition

22:39.664 --> 22:42.499
and an end to the heart of us.

22:44.127 --> 22:49.002
I have been informed
that Bunker Hill Academy is to be closed,

22:49.090 --> 22:53.503
all of its buildings torn down,
nothing to be left...

22:53.594 --> 22:55.920
but memories.

22:56.014 --> 23:03.428
It is the decision of the board of trustees
in their wisdom that this institution be sold

23:03.521 --> 23:08.479
and the land developed
for its real estate potential.

23:10.111 --> 23:12.732
In order to allow
the incoming seniors to graduate

23:12.822 --> 23:18.065
and the underclassmen
to seek enrolment elsewhere,

23:18.161 --> 23:24.958
the board has graciously extended
the date of termination for one year.

23:26.586 --> 23:28.662
One year.

23:30.214 --> 23:32.456
I stand here today with you

23:32.550 --> 23:35.468
and look out over these young men

23:36.846 --> 23:41.555
and of course I am reminded of other
commencement days and other young men,

23:41.642 --> 23:44.560
men of courage and conviction,

23:44.645 --> 23:47.599
men who have given everything.

23:47.690 --> 23:52.767
In Mexico.
In the great catastrophe of the Civil War.

23:52.862 --> 23:55.400
In Flanders and the Argonne.

23:55.490 --> 23:59.322
In the jungles of the Philippines
and on Omaha Beach.

23:59.410 --> 24:03.242
In the snows of Bastogne,
in the Mekong Delta

24:03.331 --> 24:06.782
and at the siege of Khe Sanh.

24:08.169 --> 24:13.958
How, then,
can others say this land is for sale?

24:15.593 --> 24:20.006
It has been purchased and paid for

24:20.098 --> 24:24.095
with the blood of our graduates.

24:26.479 --> 24:31.188
I am a veteran of many terrible battles.

24:31.275 --> 24:37.444
But no battle is more important than this one,
and this final battle I intend to win.

24:37.532 --> 24:39.608
We have a year.

24:39.701 --> 24:44.363
Entire wars have been won in less time.

24:45.873 --> 24:49.207
Men of the corps,
so long as breath and spirit remain,

24:49.293 --> 24:54.501
we must fight to preserve this academy

24:55.967 --> 25:02.965
so that the traditions that were born here
may endure here.

25:04.142 --> 25:08.436
We must pledge ourselves to that mission.

25:49.479 --> 25:51.851
<i>Yes, come in.</i>

25:57.779 --> 26:00.400
Major Moreland
requesting permission to speak.

26:00.490 --> 26:01.948
Go ahead, Major.

26:02.033 --> 26:07.193
Sir, those of us staying summer session
were wondering... We wondered if...

26:07.288 --> 26:09.364
Stand at ease, Major.

26:10.958 --> 26:13.580
Sir, how can they do this?

26:15.421 --> 26:18.091
With the stroke of a pen, sir.

26:19.717 --> 26:23.169
Their field of honour was a desk top.

26:24.263 --> 26:27.383
They didn't consult me.

26:28.810 --> 26:31.052
Never hinted at what their plans were.

26:31.145 --> 26:35.854
They just papered it and pencilled it
and went ahead and did it

26:35.942 --> 26:38.184
because that's what the numbers said.

26:38.277 --> 26:43.236
Sir, all they want is money.
Let them raise the tuition. We'll pay it.

26:46.119 --> 26:49.867
I'm afraid it's not quite that simple, son.

26:52.166 --> 26:59.877
There's a feeling on the outside
that schools like this are anachronistic

26:59.966 --> 27:05.755
and leaders of men
like you and me are dinosaurs.

27:05.847 --> 27:07.720
Sir?

27:09.267 --> 27:11.758
Well, you go to the movies, you read books.

27:11.853 --> 27:16.313
A military leader is always portrayed
as slightly insane.

27:16.399 --> 27:19.732
Very often more than slightly.

27:19.819 --> 27:26.735
That's because it is insane to cling to honour

27:28.703 --> 27:33.116
in a world where honour is held in contempt.

27:33.207 --> 27:38.450
Sir, I don't know
if I really deserve the rank of major.

27:38.546 --> 27:44.798
My first thought was for myself.
I didn't think about the others or the school...

27:44.886 --> 27:48.219
- Sit down, Mr Moreland.
- Sir.

27:55.313 --> 27:58.931
Never be ashamed of being human.

27:59.025 --> 28:02.441
Without humanity, a leader becomes a tyrant.

28:02.528 --> 28:07.949
I was relieved. I figured I had another year.
I could graduate and go on to West Point.

28:08.034 --> 28:11.154
So you will. And the others too.

28:12.747 --> 28:18.868
I haven't spent a lifetime fighting
just to turn over and play dead now.

28:26.677 --> 28:30.924
I came to Bunker Hill when I was 12 years old.

28:33.851 --> 28:36.093
Just like you.

28:39.983 --> 28:45.357
With the exception of those 12 years,
I've been in uniform all my life.

28:45.446 --> 28:49.064
I know men younger than myself
who take their pensions

28:49.158 --> 28:54.153
and put on stupid little white shirts
with cut-off sleeves,

28:54.247 --> 28:56.820
alligator on the tit,

28:57.875 --> 29:01.209
and spend the rest of their days

29:01.295 --> 29:05.507
beating the hell out of a little white ball
with an iron club.

29:05.592 --> 29:10.716
My God!
The thought of it makes me want to puke.

29:11.889 --> 29:14.594
They like it like that, civilians.

29:14.684 --> 29:19.844
Well, the one thing civilians know
is their rights.

29:19.939 --> 29:23.557
And they're within their rights
to push us out

29:23.651 --> 29:30.982
to make way
for their goddamned condominiums.

29:32.535 --> 29:35.109
But we have one little advantage on them.

29:35.204 --> 29:38.739
- What's that, sir?
- We're here.

29:38.833 --> 29:41.371
And the condos aren't.

29:42.295 --> 29:44.833
We have a foothold.

29:46.799 --> 29:50.667
You boys are my purpose. You're my family.

29:51.596 --> 29:55.843
And I'm not going to let them
take you away from me.

30:06.444 --> 30:11.272
We won't either, sir. We won't let them.

30:17.288 --> 30:19.910
- I knew something like this would happen.
- Sure.

30:19.999 --> 30:24.328
I figured after one whole year of being
shit on, I'd get hit by a bus or something

30:24.420 --> 30:27.125
and never get a chance
to shit on the next bunch.

30:27.215 --> 30:30.381
So you didn't get hit by a bus. So what?

30:30.468 --> 30:32.259
Thank you, sir.

30:32.345 --> 30:35.050
They'll find me another school for next year.

30:35.139 --> 30:37.809
It'll be another year of getting shit on.

30:37.892 --> 30:40.679
Will your folks
let you come back here for one year?

30:40.770 --> 30:43.261
Maybe. I don't know.

30:44.273 --> 30:48.437
- Snow White and the two dwarves.
- I'm not in any mood for your shit, Dwyer.

30:48.528 --> 30:51.482
- Just trying to be friendly.
- Yeah.

30:51.572 --> 30:56.115
So... what's Moreland say about all this?

30:56.911 --> 31:00.743
He says it'll never happen.
Bache'll come in and save the day.

31:00.832 --> 31:04.201
- I think he's right.
- That makes two of you.

31:04.293 --> 31:07.211
So what do you think, Dwyer?

31:09.257 --> 31:13.089
I think your mother never gave you any toys
when you were a baby.

31:13.177 --> 31:17.507
Neither did Dwyer's,
so he had to play with his sister's.

31:19.976 --> 31:22.811
<i>Let's go!</i>

31:25.982 --> 31:28.473
Can I use your comb?

31:30.695 --> 31:35.985
Jesus! I feel like a big fat hairy hand reached
inside of me and yanked something out.

31:36.075 --> 31:38.531
Don't sweat it, West. It ain't over.

31:38.619 --> 31:42.664
- Great. We still get our year.
- Forget about that one year business.

31:42.749 --> 31:46.283
This place will be here after
the pencil pushers are in the boneyard.

31:49.130 --> 31:53.293
Don't forget that we're here
and the condos aren't. We've got a foothold.

31:54.385 --> 31:56.876
Jesus Christ, it's the Bug again.

31:56.971 --> 32:01.265
Every boy needs a hero.
With the Bug, it's Jim Morrison.

32:50.733 --> 32:55.027
Sir, may I present Miss Lori Cable?
Lori, this is General Bache, our commander.

32:55.113 --> 32:58.030
- How do you do?
- I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

32:58.116 --> 33:02.861
And I you. Dean Ferris, this is Miss Lori
Cable. A guest of Major Cooper tonight.

33:02.954 --> 33:05.705
- Well done, John.
- Thank you, sir.

33:05.790 --> 33:08.993
Hello. I know that lovely face
but I've forgotten your name.

33:09.085 --> 33:12.086
- Cindy Morris.
- Cindy, yes. Dean Ferris, Cindy Morris.

33:12.171 --> 33:16.964
Well done. It was touch and go there
for a while, wasn't it? I'm proud of you.

33:17.301 --> 33:19.590
All right, all right!

33:37.238 --> 33:39.396
All right, all right!

33:39.490 --> 33:41.898
How would you like to see a real stud?

33:41.993 --> 33:44.116
My man Mikey's in love!

33:44.996 --> 33:47.665
Have fun, JC.

33:47.749 --> 33:52.245
Let me show you how a stud works.
Come on, come on!

34:02.513 --> 34:06.926
- You want us to call the cops?
- Call 'em, asshole!

34:11.647 --> 34:14.399
You gonna ask me out now or what?

34:14.484 --> 34:18.731
What are you looking at, huh?
Hey, come here.

34:22.366 --> 34:25.367
What do you guys do with each other?

34:28.456 --> 34:32.205
- Keep the area clear. Stay away from the gate.
- Yes, sir!

34:32.293 --> 34:35.496
<i>Keep this area clear!
Stay away from the gate!</i>

34:35.588 --> 34:38.161
<i>- Sieg heil!
- We'll keep this area clear, sir!</i>

34:39.217 --> 34:42.550
- Why don't you make us leave, fag?
- Yeah!

34:42.637 --> 34:44.510
Chicken!

34:45.348 --> 34:47.471
What did I tell you, huh?

34:48.059 --> 34:50.264
- Don't do that.
- Hit him!

35:02.949 --> 35:05.487
<i>Knock it off! Break it up!</i>

35:05.576 --> 35:07.653
Break it up!

35:21.175 --> 35:24.093
Call an ambulance! Move it!

35:26.514 --> 35:29.087
It was an accident, sir.

35:30.852 --> 35:34.517
There was a round in the chamber. I forgot.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.854
You killed him.

35:42.822 --> 35:44.898
I'm sorry.

36:04.385 --> 36:06.461
<i>Attention!</i>

36:13.603 --> 36:17.731
General, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

36:44.884 --> 36:47.553
Look, pipe down.

36:48.679 --> 36:52.760
- Come on, Bug. Get the shit out of it!
- If you can do better, go ahead.

36:52.850 --> 36:56.800
- Come on, keep it down!
- What is the problem here?

36:57.355 --> 37:00.973
<i>Sure looks like one to me.
Chest pain, shortness of breath. Over.</i>

37:01.067 --> 37:04.732
<i>Take the general to Valley Community.
Call once he's checked over.</i>

37:04.821 --> 37:06.564
<i>Roger. Out.</i>

37:53.035 --> 37:54.696
Hello?

37:54.787 --> 37:56.994
Where are you?

37:57.081 --> 38:00.284
Oh. So when will you get here?

38:00.376 --> 38:03.911
I'm all right. I wasn't part of anything.

38:04.922 --> 38:09.335
No, that's OK. I can stay here.
There'll be guys here.

38:09.427 --> 38:13.294
I said it's OK.
I don't know what you expect me to say.

38:15.016 --> 38:17.424
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

38:17.518 --> 38:21.433
It's just that I thought you'd be here.

38:21.522 --> 38:23.895
I'd rather stay here.

38:23.983 --> 38:26.059
Really.

38:28.404 --> 38:31.239
I love you too. Bye.

38:45.213 --> 38:47.834
- You let me know what happens, OK?
- All right.

38:47.924 --> 38:49.715
- You take care.
- OK.

38:49.801 --> 38:52.007
- Good summer.
- You too.

39:01.896 --> 39:06.060
Hand grenades, fragmentation M-26,
24 to a case, one case.

39:06.150 --> 39:11.357
Machine guns, M-2, one per crate, 36 crates.

39:11.447 --> 39:13.523
36 M-2s.

39:13.616 --> 39:16.985
4.2 inch mortar rounds,
four per case, we have 20 cases.

39:17.078 --> 39:20.862
- Got it.
- M-16s, ten full racks.

39:20.957 --> 39:24.540
All right, that's 20 to a rack.

39:24.627 --> 39:27.248
200 M-16s.

39:27.338 --> 39:33.293
45mm automatics, model 1911,
four racks, 24 to a rack.

39:34.679 --> 39:37.550
Six crates of M-16 bayonets.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.392
Six 81mm mortars.

39:40.476 --> 39:44.308
Bache has enough armament here
to start World War III.

39:44.397 --> 39:48.097
- So glad they're going.
- I didn't want them here in the first place.

39:48.192 --> 39:52.689
That was the general's notion
of national defence, stock...

39:53.614 --> 39:57.066
- How did you get in here?
- The door was open.

39:58.202 --> 40:00.278
Wonderful.

40:00.371 --> 40:03.076
- What do you say we lock it?
- What's going on?

40:03.166 --> 40:07.246
We're taking inventory.
We're no longer to be trusted with weapons.

40:07.336 --> 40:08.961
What are we gonna drill with?

40:09.047 --> 40:11.123
- After last night?
- That was an accident.

40:11.215 --> 40:14.501
That's not for you to decide
and I don't care to discuss it.

40:14.594 --> 40:17.215
Look, I came to ask about the general.

40:17.305 --> 40:20.259
- He's in intensive care.
- How is he?

40:20.349 --> 40:23.849
They say the next 24 hours
will be the critical stage.

40:23.937 --> 40:26.309
He's a strong man. He'll be all right.

40:26.397 --> 40:30.893
- You can ask for yourself.
- I called. They wouldn't let me talk to him.

40:30.985 --> 40:33.737
- You know as much as I do.
- Well, who...

40:33.822 --> 40:36.490
Who's gonna be in charge
of the summer session?

40:36.574 --> 40:40.109
I'm not sure there'll be a summer session.

40:40.203 --> 40:42.160
What?

40:42.246 --> 40:43.990
Goodbye, Mr Moreland.

40:55.385 --> 40:59.429
<i>They're worthwhile only if there is
a reasonable chance for success.</i>

40:59.514 --> 41:04.010
<i>- How much time has elapsed since...
- 18 hours and 12 minutes.</i>

41:04.102 --> 41:05.726
<i>Dr McCoy must have told you...</i>

41:05.812 --> 41:08.350
- Why doesn't he use his phaser?
- He can't.

41:08.439 --> 41:09.554
How come?

41:09.649 --> 41:13.148
The brain's protected
by a phaser-proof electromagnetic shield.

41:13.236 --> 41:16.735
- You seen this one before?
- I've seen all of them before.

41:16.823 --> 41:19.361
- Turn on the news!
- You're not supposed to be here!

41:19.450 --> 41:21.324
We're watching this!

41:25.581 --> 41:27.040
Shut up!

41:27.125 --> 41:31.870
<i>... shattered overnight by
the still-unexplained shooting of a local boy.</i>

41:31.963 --> 41:36.755
<i>Donald Andrews, 17, of Foxhaven,
died late last night</i>

41:36.843 --> 41:39.215
<i>as a result of a gunshot wound...</i>

41:39.303 --> 41:43.597
<i>- God, the kid bought it, huh?
- ... between local boys and cadets.</i>

41:43.683 --> 41:47.633
<i>The shot was allegedly fiired
by General Harlan Bache,</i>

41:47.729 --> 41:51.097
<i>superintendent
of the Bunker Hill Military Academy.</i>

41:51.190 --> 41:57.110
<i>In response, police have ordered all weapons
on academy grounds to be confiiscated.</i>

41:57.197 --> 41:59.770
What are we supposed to train with?

41:59.866 --> 42:01.942
<i>... an armoury on the school grounds,</i>

42:02.034 --> 42:05.486
<i>which cadets have used for training purposes.</i>

42:05.580 --> 42:11.784
<i>Meanwhile, General Bache lies in very critical
condition at Valley Community Hospital,</i>

42:11.878 --> 42:17.252
<i>suffering from a heart attack which occurred
immediately following the tragic events.</i>

42:17.341 --> 42:21.173
<i>The school, which had planned
to cease operations next June,</i>

42:21.262 --> 42:24.382
<i>has been ordered closed immediately
by its proprietors.</i>

42:24.474 --> 42:27.724
<i>- What?
- Son of a bitch!</i>

42:27.810 --> 42:31.144
Anderson's father's a big lawyer.
Maybe he can write something.

42:32.690 --> 42:35.477
Shovel,
stop your goddamn feeding your face!

42:35.568 --> 42:39.946
I'd like to grab a grenade
and ram it right up their asses!

42:40.031 --> 42:42.438
That's not fair.

42:44.202 --> 42:46.953
- Stop feeding!
- They don't even give a shit!

42:47.038 --> 42:49.529
Leave me alone!

42:49.624 --> 42:50.738
Hey!

42:50.833 --> 42:52.909
<i>Here's today's closing fiigure.</i>

42:57.924 --> 43:01.838
The lady said the proprietors
ordered the school closed.

43:02.804 --> 43:05.923
Now, as I see it, we are the proprietors.

43:06.015 --> 43:09.431
- What does that mean to us?
- Get the door.

43:11.395 --> 43:14.231
All right, now listen up.

43:29.580 --> 43:33.364
Mr Stewart?
Captain Dwyer, sir, Bunker Hill Academy.

43:33.459 --> 43:36.745
- What can I do for you?
- Provision list, sir.

43:36.838 --> 43:40.456
- I heard they were closing.
- Mopping-up battalion has to eat.

43:40.550 --> 43:43.883
Took 150 years to build it.
Gonna take time to put it to bed.

43:43.970 --> 43:46.508
Usually they want me
to deliver the stuff myself.

43:46.597 --> 43:49.682
SOP undergoing change
because of all the unpleasantness.

43:49.767 --> 43:51.926
- SOP?
- Standard operating procedure.

43:52.020 --> 43:54.557
Call the academy for verification.

43:54.647 --> 43:57.352
- Oh, no. That's OK.
- Thank you, sir. Let's go.

43:57.441 --> 44:00.015
Come on, let's go. Move it!

44:11.247 --> 44:16.751
Forward post to Lee One.
They're coming through the gate. Over.

44:34.312 --> 44:37.597
Command post to Lee One.
Vehicle on the way. Over.

44:42.987 --> 44:47.774
Wait a minute.

44:47.867 --> 44:49.860
What is this?

44:52.288 --> 44:56.416
They were all right here just hours ago.

44:57.293 --> 45:00.709
I... I don't understand.

45:00.797 --> 45:04.166
See those racks? They were filled.

45:04.258 --> 45:06.714
What's going on here, Dean?

45:10.306 --> 45:14.138
- Moreland?
- Who is this boy?

45:14.227 --> 45:18.639
He's the ranking cadet. Moreland.
Do you have any explanation for this?

45:18.731 --> 45:20.605
My God. Where are all the weapons?

45:20.691 --> 45:24.107
- The weapons are secured, sir.
- What do you mean secured?

45:24.195 --> 45:28.145
- You mean you stole them?
- No, sir. We confiscated them.

45:28.241 --> 45:31.491
- Dean, where's the phone?
- There's one in the office.

45:31.577 --> 45:34.697
- Afraid not, sir. We've cut the lines.
- Oh, my God.

45:34.789 --> 45:38.739
If you don't turn those weapons over
immediately, you're going to jail.

45:38.835 --> 45:41.789
The right to bear arms
is guaranteed in the Constitution.

45:41.879 --> 45:45.295
Tell us where the weapons are
or this'll be the sorriest day of your life.

45:45.383 --> 45:49.297
We have three demands.
When they're met, we'll return every weapon.

45:49.387 --> 45:52.174
- Who else...?
- Number one. I want a meeting with Bache...

45:52.265 --> 45:54.590
- Hands behind your back!
- Stay where you are.

45:59.480 --> 46:03.857
Number two. I want a commission
to look into the selling of this academy

46:03.943 --> 46:05.817
to real estate interests.

46:05.904 --> 46:11.324
Number three. I want a meeting between
my officers, myself, and the board of trustees

46:11.409 --> 46:15.157
to discuss alternatives
to the closing of this academy.

46:20.418 --> 46:23.953
That's it. That's all we want.

46:45.234 --> 46:49.777
- What's the problem?
- Green light, Pierce. Come on. Let's go.

46:50.990 --> 46:54.193
- Oh, shit.
- Want me to check under the hood?

46:54.285 --> 46:58.117
- For what?
- I'll know when I get there, won't I?

47:09.008 --> 47:12.459
- Hey, what's it look like?
- Try it now.

47:15.848 --> 47:18.553
Why's Dwyer checking the hood?

47:20.478 --> 47:23.230
<i>Are you seeing what I'm seeing?</i>

47:23.898 --> 47:25.558
<i>JC?</i>

47:26.693 --> 47:28.815
<i>JC!</i>

47:32.615 --> 47:35.818
<i>Wake up, Pierce. Are you reading me?</i>

47:36.661 --> 47:39.615
Dwyer, this is starting to be a real emergency.

47:39.706 --> 47:41.912
JC, are you catching that action?

47:42.000 --> 47:45.166
- You guys having some problems?
- Yeah, I see 'em.

47:45.253 --> 47:49.085
- I'm talking to you!
- Dwyer, for Christ's sake hurry up!

47:49.173 --> 47:52.258
Let's go. You guys having a problem?

47:52.343 --> 47:54.751
- Dwyer!
- Yeah, yeah.

47:54.846 --> 47:57.882
- Dammit, Pierce, come on!
- Dwyer, get back in the truck.

47:57.974 --> 47:59.801
<i>Shit.</i>

48:02.228 --> 48:05.099
- You cretins lose something?
- Just a mechanical...

48:05.189 --> 48:07.348
You're the bastard who killed Don.

48:14.782 --> 48:17.356
Move over here, quick!

48:19.495 --> 48:23.114
Move, move, move, move!
Come on! Move out!

48:29.922 --> 48:32.460
Come on! Let's go!

48:54.113 --> 48:56.818
Watch those rifles and stay to the right!

48:57.783 --> 49:00.275
Keep it moving! Keep it moving!

49:02.580 --> 49:04.703
Come on! Keep it moving!

49:04.791 --> 49:09.203
- Heads up! Look alive!
- Put that ammunition down right there.

49:09.295 --> 49:10.706
Let's go!

49:27.605 --> 49:30.178
- Move it!
- Move it!

49:30.274 --> 49:32.018
Hustle up!

49:32.110 --> 49:34.779
Soldier, bring that around over there!

49:34.862 --> 49:37.567
Come on, soldier! Hurry!

49:40.410 --> 49:43.410
- You hear from them yet in town?
- They're coming home.

49:43.496 --> 49:45.073
Here they come!

49:57.677 --> 50:00.298
<i>We got it!</i>

50:00.388 --> 50:02.843
What the hell were you doing back there?

50:02.932 --> 50:05.886
Pulling your lame ass
outta the grinder, shithead.

50:05.977 --> 50:09.262
- I could kick your ass from here to Albany.
- You try!

50:09.355 --> 50:12.060
- What's going on?
- He rammed a sheriffs car.

50:12.150 --> 50:15.982
- What's the problem?
- This asshole just shot up the town.

50:16.070 --> 50:19.155
- I didn't buy into this to blow people away.
- We're here!

50:19.240 --> 50:22.775
- We're not sitting in jail, we're here!
- Did you get the food?

50:22.869 --> 50:25.075
- Half of it.
- Half is better than nothing.

50:25.163 --> 50:27.405
The guy's a maniac. He rammed a sheriff.

50:27.498 --> 50:31.626
<i>Damn right. Saw my duty and I did it!</i>

50:31.711 --> 50:33.668
Everybody, quiet down!

50:33.755 --> 50:37.799
- Hulk! Escort the bus beyond the gate.
- You're gonna let them go?

50:37.884 --> 50:41.051
We're supposed to be soldiers.
We're not taking hostages.

50:41.137 --> 50:44.091
I want the officers
in the administration building.

50:44.182 --> 50:46.755
Let's move out and move the food!

50:52.148 --> 50:54.224
Attention!

50:59.364 --> 51:01.771
I don't ever want to see what I just saw.

51:03.941 --> 51:08.437
We didn't train
to go spastic at the first sign of trouble.

51:08.529 --> 51:12.229
Goddamn! I'm glad the general didn't see that.

51:12.324 --> 51:17.282
These cadets will follow you
only if they respect you.

51:17.371 --> 51:20.538
All right. Sit down. At ease.

51:24.503 --> 51:28.501
- How did we lose the truck?
- It stalled. We were in a hard place.

51:28.591 --> 51:30.963
Shawn grabbed the chance
to use his weapon.

51:31.051 --> 51:36.556
We were in an explosive situation
which jeopardised the mission. I defused it.

51:36.640 --> 51:41.433
- Beautiful. You really have a way with words.
- He did get us out of it, Alex.

51:41.520 --> 51:46.348
You'd still be getting thrown around by those
townies if he hadn't cut loose a few rounds.

51:46.442 --> 51:49.977
I don't like the idea of gunplay,
but the mission was successful.

51:50.070 --> 51:54.068
That's my whole point! I don't call
what happened a successful mission.

51:54.158 --> 51:56.530
- Naturally.
- We have to show we're serious.

51:56.619 --> 51:59.288
- And we don't want to hurt anyone.
- What are we asking?

51:59.372 --> 52:01.660
That the school be kept open. That's all.

52:01.749 --> 52:05.698
Other kids are vandalising their school.
We want ours to stay open.

52:05.794 --> 52:09.413
If we behave like soldiers
and not kids in a riot, we can win this.

52:09.507 --> 52:12.080
- It's gotta be done by the book.
- That's all I ask.

52:12.176 --> 52:16.339
It'll be done by the book. We stick together,
we go the whole nine yards.

52:16.430 --> 52:18.506
<i>- Agreed?
- Agreed.</i>

52:20.351 --> 52:22.924
Sound the general alarm.

53:14.572 --> 53:17.857
Boys, this is Lieutenant Hanson
of the state police.

53:17.950 --> 53:22.991
Before things get out of hand, put down your
weapons and open the gates. You hear me?

53:23.080 --> 53:26.330
We have conditions first.
Let's have an answer on those.

53:26.417 --> 53:29.168
<i>You have illegally seized private property.</i>

53:29.253 --> 53:32.836
Under the state penal code
you have committed grand larceny.

53:32.923 --> 53:35.461
You have threatened the life
of a federal officer.

53:35.551 --> 53:37.793
Nobody's life was threatened.

53:37.887 --> 53:40.378
<i>You fired upon citizens and a deputy sheriff.</i>

53:40.473 --> 53:42.761
You boys are in very serious trouble.

53:42.850 --> 53:46.184
- Put down your weapons or we'll use force.
- What about the demands?

53:46.270 --> 53:49.390
You have one minute to comply.

53:55.529 --> 53:57.937
Get down!

54:05.206 --> 54:08.740
- 35 seconds.
- Can we speak to General Bache?

54:18.969 --> 54:20.879
15 seconds.

54:24.100 --> 54:26.637
- Prepare to assault!
- Prepare to repel!

54:35.486 --> 54:37.644
- Don't shoot me!
- Hold your fire!

54:37.738 --> 54:39.565
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

54:39.657 --> 54:42.408
Don't shoot me!

54:49.208 --> 54:51.284
Pull it back!

54:58.384 --> 55:01.420
<i>Would you describe the situation
at Bunker Hill as stalemate?</i>

55:01.512 --> 55:03.303
<i>I would not call it a stalemate.</i>

55:03.389 --> 55:07.552
<i>We're trying to ascertain how many cadets
are rebellious and how many are hostages.</i>

55:07.643 --> 55:11.688
<i>- We hadn't heard there were hostages.
- We have reason to believe there are.</i>

55:11.772 --> 55:14.643
<i>Are the police prepared to use force
to end the situation?</i>

55:14.733 --> 55:20.238
<i>We will protect the lives and the property of
the people of the state. If it means resorting...</i>

55:20.322 --> 55:21.816
<i>Even if that means...</i>

55:21.907 --> 55:24.778
They won't interview us.

55:24.868 --> 55:27.406
The police won't let 'em.

55:28.247 --> 55:34.961
Why do I get the feeling that that guy
would get pleasure blowing our brains out?

55:35.045 --> 55:39.292
- Do you see any way out of this?
- Depends on Bache.

55:41.552 --> 55:44.838
I'm wondering about that heart attack.

55:44.930 --> 55:48.631
What if General Bache
never even had a heart attack?

55:49.185 --> 55:53.348
- What if they're just keeping him from us?
- Why would they do that?

55:53.439 --> 55:58.564
I don't know. To rattle us, make more
of the whole thing than we ever wanted.

55:58.652 --> 56:01.819
We never wanted any goddamn war.

57:04.009 --> 57:06.168
- Order!
- Order!

57:06.261 --> 57:08.753
Arms!

57:08.848 --> 57:11.339
Company commanders, take your posts.

57:11.434 --> 57:13.841
Prepare for inspection.

57:35.458 --> 57:38.957
Major! Hey! Hey!

57:39.044 --> 57:43.422
Something's going on! The head cop's
on the box and he wants to talk to you.

57:43.507 --> 57:47.457
<i>All right! We got it!</i>

57:49.346 --> 57:51.588
Shawn, take over!

57:53.392 --> 57:56.144
Battalion dismissed!

57:56.228 --> 57:58.898
<i>Yaw!</i>

58:09.450 --> 58:11.526
This is Major Moreland. Over.

58:11.619 --> 58:14.406
<i>- This is Sergeant Briggs.
- Yes, sir.</i>

58:14.497 --> 58:17.414
<i>I have a delegation here
that wants to meet with you.</i>

58:17.500 --> 58:20.370
Tell the board
we'll be honoured to meet with them.

58:20.461 --> 58:23.166
<i>It's a delegation of parents.</i>

58:25.341 --> 58:27.713
<i>- Parents?
- Six of them.</i>

58:27.802 --> 58:31.420
<i>The man in charge
is Master Sergeant Kevin Moreland.</i>

58:31.513 --> 58:34.052
<i>Will you talk to them?</i>

58:43.275 --> 58:46.894
Yes, sir. Send them in at 0930 hours.

58:46.987 --> 58:49.063
<i>Affiirmative.</i>

59:03.546 --> 59:05.953
So it's your father. So what?

59:06.048 --> 59:10.924
Damn near everybody here has got
a mother or father hanging around outside.

59:11.011 --> 59:15.590
- You don't.
- Yeah, well, I'm a hard case.

59:16.850 --> 59:18.510
- Sorry.
- Forget it.

59:18.602 --> 59:24.475
Look, at least your old man has got
a nodding acquaintance with the real world.

59:24.567 --> 59:27.140
Hell, I like him.

59:29.030 --> 59:31.355
Everybody likes my old man.

59:31.448 --> 59:36.787
You do too, Brian. Admit it.
That's why you're so scared.

59:36.871 --> 59:39.788
No, I ain't scared.

59:39.874 --> 59:43.539
I don't know if I like him.
I'm still thinking about it.

59:43.627 --> 59:46.961
Yeah, well, don't rush into anything.

59:50.342 --> 59:56.511
When my mother died I was sitting
in the hallway in the army hospital.

59:56.599 --> 01:00:03.182
I was worried as hell. I knew she was
real sick. She had this bad kidney thing.

01:00:03.272 --> 01:00:08.349
So I'm sitting there
and my father comes out of the room

01:00:08.444 --> 01:00:10.935
and tells me that she's dead.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.699
He led me to this little chapel they had there

01:00:13.782 --> 01:00:18.741
and he sat me down
and he told me I could cry for 15 minutes.

01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:23.906
He gave me 15 minutes to cry
and after that I wasn't supposed to cry again.

01:00:24.001 --> 01:00:29.078
So he left me alone in the chapel

01:00:30.257 --> 01:00:33.757
and came back...
he came back 15 minutes later.

01:00:33.844 --> 01:00:39.717
- Jesus. What did you do?
- Well, I did what I was told.

01:00:40.935 --> 01:00:43.770
I cried for 15 minutes.

01:01:01.705 --> 01:01:04.410
She was a beautiful woman...

01:01:05.543 --> 01:01:07.619
my mother.

01:01:09.422 --> 01:01:12.339
She was crazy about the old man.

01:01:13.926 --> 01:01:17.591
I don't know, I guess he loved her too.

01:01:18.847 --> 01:01:21.849
You never told me that story.

01:01:24.228 --> 01:01:27.098
Yeah, I was 12. That's when I came here.

01:01:27.189 --> 01:01:29.265
<i>Brian.</i>

01:01:29.358 --> 01:01:32.644
Hey, Brian, they're down at the gate.
Better get going.

01:01:32.736 --> 01:01:34.812
All right.

01:01:42.038 --> 01:01:45.869
When this is over,
you and me are gonna go round and round.

01:01:45.958 --> 01:01:50.335
Yeah. But first
you're gonna move your goddamn arm.

01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:10.522
- Hello, Brian.
- Hello, sir.

01:02:12.151 --> 01:02:15.235
You look like
you might have grown an inch or two.

01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:19.188
- You've put on a couple of pounds too.
- A couple.

01:02:19.283 --> 01:02:23.281
- Sorry you had to come all the way up here.
- Nah.

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.368
- How you doing, Alex?
- Hello, Sergeant Moreland.

01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:30.708
- The old place looks different...
- Get to the bottom line.

01:02:30.794 --> 01:02:32.871
Hold your water.

01:02:34.965 --> 01:02:37.421
Bottom line.

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:40.427
The truth is
these folks are worried about their kids.

01:02:40.512 --> 01:02:43.597
They think some of them
are being held against their will.

01:02:43.682 --> 01:02:46.256
Everyone's here
because they want to be here.

01:02:46.352 --> 01:02:49.057
Our son would not be involved
in something like this.

01:02:49.146 --> 01:02:53.808
Lady, if my son can be involved in it, your
son can be. Let's not get holier-than-thou.

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:57.187
- Let us hear it from our children.
- Yes.

01:02:57.279 --> 01:03:00.897
I can't call my soldiers away from their posts
to calm down their parents.

01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:04.989
- You're only children!
- They'll try to add kidnapping to the rest of it.

01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:06.988
- We want to see our kid.
- I'll try.

01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:09.073
- Good.
- Under my terms.

01:03:09.166 --> 01:03:12.950
I hope you're proud, Sergeant Moreland.
You have fathered a son of a bitch.

01:03:13.045 --> 01:03:16.912
You people shut up!
I can't think through all your static.

01:03:17.007 --> 01:03:19.795
We aren't in the army, Sergeant.

01:03:19.885 --> 01:03:22.839
No apologies necessary.

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:27.391
Just keep the hell quiet
and let me take care of this.

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:33.721
Frigging feather merchants.

01:03:38.904 --> 01:03:42.902
I don't blame them, sir.
It's a little hard to understand.

01:03:42.992 --> 01:03:46.158
- Ever get in the habit?
- Oh. No, sir. No, thanks.

01:03:46.245 --> 01:03:49.246
Smart. Damn things will kill you.

01:03:57.715 --> 01:04:02.044
- What am I gonna tell those people?
- I never thought this would involve you.

01:04:02.136 --> 01:04:06.715
Let me tell 'em it was growing pains.
The wrong execution of the right idea.

01:04:07.683 --> 01:04:13.139
- The wrong execution of the right idea?
- Yeah. They'll understand that.

01:04:13.689 --> 01:04:17.058
Look, Brian, all the men in our family
have been soldiers.

01:04:17.151 --> 01:04:20.318
- I know.
- Plain dogfaces with a knack for surviving.

01:04:20.404 --> 01:04:24.616
- I hoped somebody would break into brass.
- I have my command.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:29.029
You're not thinking straight. You have
a bad way to lose a pretty bright future, kid.

01:04:29.121 --> 01:04:31.826
Stop calling me kid.

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:39.540
You expect me to call you Major?

01:04:39.632 --> 01:04:42.039
You can forget it.

01:04:42.134 --> 01:04:46.880
Look at this operation. You got your strength
nose to nose with the cops.

01:04:46.972 --> 01:04:52.678
Eventually even they'll figure out you've got
a vulnerable rear flank and they'll sneak in.

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:56.898
There, by the field, behind the trees,
and they'll throw a net over your asses.

01:04:56.982 --> 01:04:58.180
You can say that...

01:04:58.275 --> 01:05:02.190
The first canister of tear gas,
half your troops'll wet their pants and run.

01:05:02.279 --> 01:05:05.530
And how bright was it
to let this delegation in here?

01:05:05.616 --> 01:05:10.527
Look at me. I could break your neck and
you wouldn't be able to do a thing about it.

01:05:10.621 --> 01:05:12.946
You'd be shot.
My next in command would take over.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.285
I read that book too.

01:05:14.375 --> 01:05:18.289
We could take you all as hostages,
but we won't. We have a code of honour.

01:05:18.379 --> 01:05:24.049
Sweet Jesus! Is that what this is all about?
Somebody's lofty shit about honour? Yours?

01:05:24.135 --> 01:05:27.420
Yes, mine, and I learned it here.
General Bache lives it...

01:05:27.513 --> 01:05:31.558
- He's here because there's no place...
- He is the example we follow!

01:05:31.642 --> 01:05:35.971
Bache has been passed over so many times,
he's got a stiff neck from the draught.

01:05:36.063 --> 01:05:40.061
Bache! Bache is living proof
that horses' asses outnumber horses!

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:43.650
Captain Shawn, escort my...
the sergeant off the base!

01:05:56.292 --> 01:05:59.743
- Muster the men in the quad.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:02.673 --> 01:06:06.089
<i>- We've pulled together well, haven't we?
- Yes, sir!</i>

01:06:06.177 --> 01:06:09.676
General Bache would be proud of us.

01:06:09.763 --> 01:06:13.892
If he were here, I know he'd tell us to hold out.

01:06:13.976 --> 01:06:19.053
To finish what we've started
and not to be halfway about anything.

01:06:19.148 --> 01:06:24.189
They're saying some of you are being held
against your will, you don't want to be here.

01:06:24.278 --> 01:06:26.852
Either they're right or we're right.

01:06:26.947 --> 01:06:31.325
Nobody's gonna cut you down
if you don't believe in what we're doing,

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:35.075
or if you're afraid of parents or the cops.

01:06:37.708 --> 01:06:43.711
Anybody who isn't 100 per cent sure
of why we're here and what we're doing,

01:06:43.964 --> 01:06:46.538
take one step forward.

01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:07.738
<i>- Battalion!
- Company!</i>

01:07:07.822 --> 01:07:10.359
Attention!

01:07:10.449 --> 01:07:11.991
- Left!
- Left!

01:07:12.076 --> 01:07:14.033
Face!

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.159
- Forward!
- Forward!

01:07:16.247 --> 01:07:17.326
March!

01:07:17.415 --> 01:07:21.661
- Major Moreland, he's our man.
- Major Moreland, he's our man.

01:07:21.752 --> 01:07:25.964
- Bunker Hill we make our stand.
- Bunker Hill we make our stand.

01:07:26.048 --> 01:07:28.005
- Sound off.
- One, two.

01:07:28.092 --> 01:07:30.168
- Sound off.
- Three, four.

01:07:30.261 --> 01:07:34.389
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

01:07:42.481 --> 01:07:45.316
Sir? You got any grenades?

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.898
Thank you, sir.

01:07:57.288 --> 01:07:59.364
- You got any grenades?
- Sure.

01:07:59.457 --> 01:08:01.663
- Can I have one?
- Here you go.

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.826
- Thanks.
- Oh, and, Shovel?

01:08:03.919 --> 01:08:06.493
- Don't eat it.
- Cute.

01:08:09.675 --> 01:08:12.083
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

01:08:25.314 --> 01:08:28.685
- Any news from the outside?
- Attention.

01:08:35.326 --> 01:08:37.863
- Carry on.
- No news, sir.

01:08:37.953 --> 01:08:41.868
His batteries are down.
We can't even pick up the shitkickers.

01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:46.417
We can see them from here.
They've got their thumbs up their asses.

01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:49.540
- They don't scare us, do they, Charlie?
- No, sir.

01:08:49.631 --> 01:08:52.004
Me either, sir. They don't scare me.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.721
<i>- Good night, guys.
- Good night, sir.</i>

01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:02.099
Charlie.

01:09:20.578 --> 01:09:22.738
That's what I call grace under pressure.

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:25.582
Why not? Nero fiddled while Rome burned.

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:30.377
- That wasn't grace, that was crazy.
- Depends on your point of view.

01:09:30.464 --> 01:09:32.124
That's Peru.

01:09:32.216 --> 01:09:36.296
- Meaning?
- Meaning maybe this is just as crazy.

01:09:37.888 --> 01:09:40.723
Alex, you've been picking at this
from the beginning.

01:09:40.808 --> 01:09:42.884
What's wrong with you?

01:09:42.977 --> 01:09:46.227
Things are going beautifully.
We're in better shape now.

01:09:46.313 --> 01:09:50.228
Now we're a corps. General Bache
used to talk about men under pressure.

01:09:50.317 --> 01:09:54.529
- How they act as one. We're seeing it.
- Thus spake Saint Bache.

01:09:57.325 --> 01:09:59.897
- OK.
- He's only a man, Brian.

01:09:59.994 --> 01:10:02.366
Like your father, my father. Just a man.

01:10:02.455 --> 01:10:05.574
Not every word out of his mouth
is some holy nugget.

01:10:05.666 --> 01:10:08.418
Right. Whatever you say.

01:10:08.502 --> 01:10:11.918
Don't let that display of loyalty
go to your head.

01:10:12.006 --> 01:10:17.000
It won't mean beans to anybody out there.
They'll say it was brainwashing.

01:10:17.094 --> 01:10:20.261
Maybe they're right.

01:10:20.347 --> 01:10:25.056
I half expected you to be the one to break
ranks. Head for the comforts of home.

01:10:25.853 --> 01:10:29.222
- The thought crossed my mind.
- What stopped you?

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:44.536
My sense of honour may be a little ragged,
but I don't walk out on a friend.

01:10:54.965 --> 01:10:58.548
If you want to argue about this,
we'll argue in the morning.

01:10:58.636 --> 01:11:01.340
I've got to get some sleep.

01:11:03.474 --> 01:11:06.391
All right. It can wait till morning.

01:11:06.727 --> 01:11:10.938
What do you think they put
in those flakjackets? Is it lead or what?

01:11:11.023 --> 01:11:14.309
No. Lead's too heavy.
They wouldn't be able to move.

01:11:14.401 --> 01:11:16.809
They probably use some super-plastic.

01:11:16.904 --> 01:11:20.652
I read that it's got
something to do with the configuration...

01:11:20.741 --> 01:11:22.817
Wanna try and spell that, bonehead?

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:25.994
He couldn't even spell his own name.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.915
- What are you laughing at?
- Keep it down.

01:11:38.718 --> 01:11:41.291
Shit. Down. Berets off.

01:11:42.847 --> 01:11:47.010
Forward observation to command post.
Convoy approaching. Looks like heavy stuff.

01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:50.719
Have C Squad cover the rooftops.

01:12:00.823 --> 01:12:04.322
C Squad, rear of the building!
A Squad, behind the trees!

01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:07.944
How's it going, Brian?
They had to call in the heavyweights.

01:12:08.039 --> 01:12:10.874
- Get more power on the rooftops.
- I already have.

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:13.580
- Reinforce the rear and left flanks.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:18.378
<i>- No one fires unless I give the order.
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:13:16.982 --> 01:13:20.814
Too much! There must be
100 trucks coming in here.

01:13:20.903 --> 01:13:23.191
Don't sweat it.

01:13:42.549 --> 01:13:44.838
<i>Stephen Miller?</i>

01:13:46.387 --> 01:13:48.878
<i>Stephen Miller?</i>

01:13:48.973 --> 01:13:51.049
<i>It's Mom, honey.</i>

01:13:52.101 --> 01:13:54.722
<i>Will you listen to me, please?</i>

01:13:57.022 --> 01:14:02.693
<i>It's still not too late to come out of there
and forget it ever happened.</i>

01:14:02.778 --> 01:14:06.693
<i>We have such a wonderful summer
planned for you.</i>

01:14:06.782 --> 01:14:10.482
<i>Don't go and get involved
in something like this.</i>

01:14:10.578 --> 01:14:12.701
<i>Please.</i>

01:14:12.788 --> 01:14:15.789
<i>Don't spoil everything, now.</i>

01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:17.749
<i>Please.</i>

01:14:17.835 --> 01:14:20.955
<i>Come out and at least talk to us.</i>

01:14:22.965 --> 01:14:27.461
<i>Five minutes. Just let us know you're all right.</i>

01:14:28.512 --> 01:14:33.470
<i>Charlie Auden! This is Dad, Charlie.</i>

01:14:33.559 --> 01:14:36.726
<i>Your mother and I are pretty scared out here.</i>

01:14:36.812 --> 01:14:40.892
<i>She's crying all the time. I can't stop her.</i>

01:14:40.983 --> 01:14:46.439
<i>You were never that crazy about this school.
You've been complaining all year.</i>

01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:50.575
<i>We can't fiigure out
why you're in there somewhere with a gun.</i>

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.906
<i>I mean, we just can't believe it.</i>

01:14:54.997 --> 01:14:57.405
<i>Come on home, Charlie.</i>

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:04.166
<i>Look, you can go to any kind of school
you want to. Just come out of there.</i>

01:15:04.256 --> 01:15:06.747
<i>Please come out.</i>

01:15:06.842 --> 01:15:08.918
<i>Don't hurt yourself.</i>

01:15:09.971 --> 01:15:12.046
<i>Come on out.</i>

01:15:21.732 --> 01:15:25.812
<i>Billy. Billy, I hope you can hear me.</i>

01:15:26.862 --> 01:15:31.904
<i>You've always gone along with the crowd,
and I know kids are like that.</i>

01:15:32.493 --> 01:15:35.743
<i>But this is one thing
you've got to do for yourself.</i>

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:40.326
<i>Sometimes being accepted by your friends
isn't worth the price.</i>

01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:42.873
<i>- Your real friends...
- Who goes there?</i>

01:15:42.961 --> 01:15:45.583
- Lieutenant West.
- Advance and be recognised.

01:15:46.924 --> 01:15:49.497
Stand easy.

01:15:49.594 --> 01:15:51.835
- Everything OK?
- Yes, sir.

01:15:51.929 --> 01:15:53.174
What are your orders?

01:15:53.264 --> 01:15:56.680
Shoot anything that comes over,
under or around the wall.

01:15:56.767 --> 01:16:00.682
- On whose orders?
- Captain Shawn's, sir.

01:16:00.771 --> 01:16:03.393
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:03.482 --> 01:16:05.559
Just a minute.

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:10.987
- Would you?
- Yes, sir. No problem, sir.

01:16:11.073 --> 01:16:13.742
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:25.004 --> 01:16:27.411
Any contact?

01:16:27.506 --> 01:16:29.795
No. Nothing.

01:16:29.883 --> 01:16:34.344
Maybe they just plan on,
you know, just coming in.

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:37.680
They would have done that
if that's what they came for.

01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:41.978
I was hoping to get some word
on the general, see how he's doing.

01:16:43.438 --> 01:16:46.689
Bug, go to the mess hall
and get us a pot of hot coffee.

01:16:46.775 --> 01:16:48.851
Yes, sir.

01:16:53.532 --> 01:16:55.608
Sit down.

01:17:09.757 --> 01:17:13.671
Do you really expect them
to negotiate with us?

01:17:13.761 --> 01:17:19.348
Yeah. They're not gonna stay out there
forever. We'll hear from them.

01:17:20.392 --> 01:17:22.966
I don't know, Brian.

01:17:23.062 --> 01:17:26.846
- Things might escalate.
- Escalate? How?

01:17:26.941 --> 01:17:30.606
For one thing,
Shawn's Red Berets are really pumped up.

01:17:30.694 --> 01:17:33.779
There's a sentry out there
ready to shoot to kill.

01:17:33.864 --> 01:17:37.862
That's a sentry's job. What good is he
if he's not prepared to shoot?

01:17:37.952 --> 01:17:40.442
Maybe he's a little more than ready.

01:17:40.538 --> 01:17:42.945
And it's coming from Shawn, Brian.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:48.035
I think he's running private little pep rallies
out there for them or something.

01:17:48.128 --> 01:17:53.336
- A natural-born leader.
- He's got me a little worried, is all.

01:17:53.425 --> 01:17:56.047
He's too much into this. He's at a pitch, man.

01:17:56.137 --> 01:17:58.592
He's always been like that, Eddie.

01:17:58.681 --> 01:18:03.722
After the Hulk, who would you want
on your side if you were in a fight?

01:18:03.811 --> 01:18:08.058
- Well... Shawn.
- Right.

01:18:08.148 --> 01:18:11.767
- First I'd want to talk my way out of the fight.
- Who wouldn't?

01:18:11.861 --> 01:18:16.024
Now, listen. Nobody here wants to get killed.

01:18:16.115 --> 01:18:21.322
They know we're right
and they're not gonna come in here shooting.

01:18:22.288 --> 01:18:24.245
Trust me, Eddie.

01:18:42.558 --> 01:18:47.220
<i>- Order!
- Order arms!</i>

01:18:47.313 --> 01:18:50.847
- Parade!
- Parade rest!

01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:55.151
Company commanders, front and centre.

01:19:02.077 --> 01:19:04.615
- Status?
- D Troop, two men missing, sir.

01:19:04.705 --> 01:19:08.833
- Alpha Company, four men missing, sir.
- Charlie Company, five men missing, sir.

01:19:08.917 --> 01:19:11.705
- Bravo Company, all present, sir.
- Very well.

01:19:11.795 --> 01:19:15.045
- 11 goddamn scumbags!
- Hold it down!

01:19:15.132 --> 01:19:17.291
- The next yellow puke that goes...
- Shawn!

01:19:17.384 --> 01:19:21.963
I want a full report from the roommates
of the 11 that are missing. And I want...

01:19:22.056 --> 01:19:27.014
<i>Major Moreland. Major Moreland.
Contact Colonel Kerby.</i>

01:19:40.324 --> 01:19:44.737
- You're the fellow who started all this.
- Major Moreland, sir, the ranking cadet.

01:19:44.828 --> 01:19:48.826
Yes. I understand you're quite a leader,
Major Moreland.

01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:52.083
Sir, we were all well trained
here at Bunker Hill.

01:19:52.169 --> 01:19:55.621
- That's part of why we won't give it up.
- I can understand that.

01:19:55.715 --> 01:19:59.166
What's another 100 condominiums,
more or less?

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:01.715
Condominiums are more easily built
than leaders.

01:20:01.804 --> 01:20:03.880
Yeah. Exactly.

01:20:03.973 --> 01:20:08.302
Only... you and I don't have
the last word on that subject.

01:20:08.394 --> 01:20:10.517
But I do have something to say about it.

01:20:10.604 --> 01:20:16.689
Mr Moreland, you know and I know
that it's never gonna go your way.

01:20:17.653 --> 01:20:20.571
You do know that, don't you?

01:20:20.656 --> 01:20:24.440
- You got something to tell me, Colonel?
- I'm telling you.

01:20:24.535 --> 01:20:28.449
Brian, I'm no fancy negotiator
with a PhD in psychology.

01:20:28.539 --> 01:20:30.697
That's not what I do for a living.

01:20:30.791 --> 01:20:34.077
I'm the governor's muscle.
I get called when he gets nervous.

01:20:34.169 --> 01:20:37.124
Don't try to scare us.
The police already tried that.

01:20:37.214 --> 01:20:40.381
I know,
and your parents didn't fare any better.

01:20:41.302 --> 01:20:45.631
But I've got to let you know
what's going on out there.

01:20:45.723 --> 01:20:48.474
They don't see you guys
as rebels with a good cause.

01:20:48.559 --> 01:20:52.509
They think you're home-grown terrorists
and it's got 'em scared shitless.

01:20:52.604 --> 01:20:55.689
- Nice American boys don't act like this.
- We have a home here.

01:20:55.774 --> 01:20:59.558
Something we think is worth defending.
Why is that so tough to understand?

01:20:59.653 --> 01:21:04.481
Sure, and you have the right to defend it,
in all the accepted ways. Hell, I'll help you.

01:21:04.575 --> 01:21:07.529
But you can't start
by stealing government property.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:10.241
I've seen what happens
when you go the other way.

01:21:10.331 --> 01:21:12.407
We'd get up to bat
and the game would be over.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:16.449
At least you would all be alive,
which is all I give a damn about.

01:21:16.545 --> 01:21:19.214
Don't worry about us.

01:21:22.384 --> 01:21:25.054
How many kids do you have here?

01:21:26.972 --> 01:21:31.551
Come on, for Christ's sake.
It's not classified information.

01:21:31.644 --> 01:21:33.518
100?

01:21:33.604 --> 01:21:34.767
115?

01:21:36.232 --> 01:21:41.570
I've seen ten create a fearful momentum
and you have over 100 here. With weapons.

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:46.313
- And some really don't want to be here...
- You saw the muster yesterday.

01:21:46.408 --> 01:21:49.777
- They had a chance to leave, they stayed.
- 11 kids did leave.

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:53.037
Sounds like 11 boys
who weren't much good to us anyway.

01:21:53.124 --> 01:21:55.496
I don't care what happened here.

01:21:55.584 --> 01:21:59.629
I don't wanna see scared kids crawling
over the wall in the middle of the night.

01:21:59.713 --> 01:22:03.047
You won't.
Escort the colonel back to the gate.

01:22:03.133 --> 01:22:05.209
Yes, sir.

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:13.719
- You don't have a whole lot of time, Brian.
- Colonel Kerby, sir.

01:22:13.811 --> 01:22:16.100
As you were, soldier.

01:22:28.117 --> 01:22:32.114
Jesus Christ! They're either soggy or stale!

01:22:32.913 --> 01:22:36.994
It's good training for a young captain,
Mr Pierce.

01:22:37.084 --> 01:22:40.251
Those guys
are probably sending out for pizza.

01:22:40.337 --> 01:22:42.247
Weekend warriors!

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:47.670
One big difference between those guys
and us. They're used to shooting at people.

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:49.837
Are you kidding?

01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:53.762
On a Monday morning, these guys
don't know a muzzle from a rat's ass.

01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:58.560
- Bet we could find a witness to say different.
- Yeah, but they couldn't shoot back.

01:22:58.647 --> 01:23:01.732
- Captain Shawn.
- Yes, sir.

01:23:01.817 --> 01:23:04.391
- Call the corps to formation.
- Everyone?

01:23:04.486 --> 01:23:06.693
- Yes, everyone.
- Yes, sir.

01:23:31.722 --> 01:23:34.557
Corps all present and accounted for, sir.

01:23:39.188 --> 01:23:42.023
Stand at ease!

01:23:45.819 --> 01:23:50.446
Gentlemen, when we started this,
we agreed it would be done by the book.

01:23:50.533 --> 01:23:53.533
A military operation.

01:23:53.619 --> 01:23:57.035
Someday we'll be respected
for what we've done.

01:23:57.582 --> 01:24:02.707
Last night 11 cadets jumped the wall.

01:24:03.921 --> 01:24:10.635
And today they're saying, outside,
that the rest of you must be hostages.

01:24:10.719 --> 01:24:13.341
A decision has to be made and it has to stick!

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:16.431
We can't tolerate any more desertions.

01:24:16.517 --> 01:24:19.851
If you don't have the guts
for what we've taken on,

01:24:19.937 --> 01:24:22.772
walk out now in the light of day.

01:24:22.856 --> 01:24:27.020
If you're as committed as I am, stay.

01:24:28.112 --> 01:24:30.685
We'll win this battle.

01:24:30.781 --> 01:24:33.106
We'll win it with honour.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:39.452
Otherwise step forward,
lay down your weapons, walk out.

01:25:48.484 --> 01:25:50.856
Take off that beret.

01:26:04.208 --> 01:26:09.582
Lieutenant West
requesting permission to be dismissed, sir.

01:26:14.259 --> 01:26:16.584
Brian.

01:26:17.513 --> 01:26:19.920
- Look, Brian...
- Dismissed.

01:26:24.812 --> 01:26:29.059
Detail, right face!

01:26:31.235 --> 01:26:33.726
Forward march!

01:27:09.732 --> 01:27:12.057
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

01:27:12.151 --> 01:27:16.777
<i>I can't believe you love the school so much
to sit there and want to die for it.</i>

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:19.699
Maybe I underestimated those damn tapes.

01:27:19.784 --> 01:27:23.318
Kids I can understand,
Hulk was always marginal, but West.

01:27:23.412 --> 01:27:26.497
It was a big mistake, Brian,
if you don't mind me saying.

01:27:26.582 --> 01:27:30.165
Bache would have never played it that way.

01:27:32.379 --> 01:27:34.870
Yeah. I wish I could talk to him.

01:27:34.965 --> 01:27:37.966
He'd tell us to hold out.

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:40.922
Yeah, I know he would.

01:27:42.932 --> 01:27:45.138
Why don't you go grab some sleep? Go on.

01:27:46.185 --> 01:27:47.928
Sleep. Can you sleep?

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:52.100
Me? Slept like a baby this afternoon.
Two whole hours.

01:27:52.191 --> 01:27:56.189
Go on, lie down, Brian. You'll feel better.

01:27:56.278 --> 01:27:59.647
- Wake me if something happens.
- Will do.

01:28:15.714 --> 01:28:20.127
Hey! Hey! What the hell's going on here?

01:28:20.219 --> 01:28:24.003
- Hey! Where's the water?
- Who turned off the goddamn...

01:28:26.559 --> 01:28:30.177
- How does it look?
- It's OK right now.

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:35.229
- We should guard the other water heaters.
- Let's make thirst a capital offence.

01:28:35.317 --> 01:28:37.855
He's right. We run out of water, we've had it.

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:40.483
If we can't trust our own guys,
what's the point?

01:28:40.573 --> 01:28:44.404
We couldn't trust them to stay with us.
How can we trust them to save water?

01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:49.404
- West cut our strength in half.
- Wait a minute, dammit.

01:28:49.499 --> 01:28:51.705
- He is our friend.
- With friends like that...

01:28:51.792 --> 01:28:55.493
Hey! I don't wanna hear anyone
bad-mouth West.

01:28:55.587 --> 01:28:58.375
He did what he felt was right.

01:28:59.925 --> 01:29:02.961
- Put guards on the water supplies.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:03.054 --> 01:29:04.845
Brian!

01:29:15.315 --> 01:29:16.894
<i>MASH!</i>

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:30.618
Any news?

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:37.334
You want the news? I'll give you the news.

01:29:37.421 --> 01:29:41.798
We take you now to reporter Alex Dwyer
on the scene of the uprising.

01:29:42.468 --> 01:29:46.299
I'm outside the gates of Bunker Hill Academy
talking to a National Guardsman,

01:29:46.389 --> 01:29:51.264
a young man not much older than the infants
who have taken over this old institution.

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:53.843
Let's see what the grunt on the street says.

01:29:53.937 --> 01:29:58.315
Trooper, how do you feel about the
possibility of taking this school by force?

01:29:58.401 --> 01:30:00.726
- Give me those!
- I'd like to frag the freaks!

01:30:00.819 --> 01:30:03.227
Sir, what's your opinion of this crisis?

01:30:03.322 --> 01:30:07.616
I feel sorry for the little cherubs. It's
society's fault. We failed to meet the needs...

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:09.445
Thank you, Private Bleeding Heart.

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:12.537
We take you now to a press meeting,
live in progress,

01:30:12.623 --> 01:30:15.957
with Colonel Adolf Kerby
of the National Guard.

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:18.119
- Can you hear me?
- You're an ass, Dwyer.

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:23.835
It's the governor's fervent hope that force
will not be necessary in retaking the school.

01:30:23.926 --> 01:30:28.837
However, the governor will not stand by
indefinitely and allow this to continue.

01:30:28.931 --> 01:30:31.885
Let's have an interview with Major Moreland.

01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:37.687
What's going on here?

01:30:37.773 --> 01:30:41.474
<i>What's going on here?</i>

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:46.694
- I'm here inside the walls of Bunker Hill...
- On your feet! Let's go!

01:30:46.782 --> 01:30:50.862
<i>... with Major Brian Moreland,
commander of the rebellious youths.</i>

01:30:50.953 --> 01:30:53.705
Correction. Defending cadets.
Let's go. Come on.

01:30:53.789 --> 01:30:57.739
- There seems to be some dissension...
- No, this is a military operation.

01:30:57.835 --> 01:31:00.077
A military operation. I see.

01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:03.670
- No dissension, no desertion and no...
- Knock it off!

01:31:03.757 --> 01:31:07.969
- Those of you not on station should sleep.
- You can't escape the press that easily.

01:31:08.053 --> 01:31:10.342
Knock it off! It's not funny any more!

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:13.301
It's getting to be a real pain in the ass! Drop it!

01:31:13.392 --> 01:31:16.227
Back to you, Walter.
The major's getting pissed off.

01:31:16.312 --> 01:31:19.763
- Come on. Move out.
- And we don't want to piss off the major.

01:31:19.857 --> 01:31:24.733
Piss off the major, you find yourself escorted
out between two of Shawn's Red Berets.

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:28.320
You just keep going and going,
don't know when to stop.

01:31:28.407 --> 01:31:30.980
Think with your brain,
you'll piss off the major.

01:31:31.077 --> 01:31:35.904
Piss off the major and you find yourself
escorted outjust like the major's father.

01:31:37.791 --> 01:31:39.998
Leave my father out of this.

01:31:40.085 --> 01:31:42.493
- Reason with the major, out you go.
- Let's go.

01:31:42.588 --> 01:31:45.921
Pretty soon there'll be nobody left
but one pissed-off major.

01:31:46.008 --> 01:31:47.881
Knock it off! We've had enough!

01:31:47.968 --> 01:31:50.756
You don't wanna save this school
for posterity.

01:31:50.846 --> 01:31:52.922
You wanna wear it like your own cocoon!

01:31:53.015 --> 01:31:56.799
Just you and Bache,
snug as two bugs queer for each other.

01:32:10.366 --> 01:32:12.691
Stay back.

01:32:12.785 --> 01:32:14.612
- Come on, Brian!
- Get him!

01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:22.741
<i>Hold it down! Hold it down!</i>

01:32:22.836 --> 01:32:25.079
- They turned off the power.
- Turn 'em on!

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:28.458
- Hold it down!
- What's that noise?

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:41.018
Listen up! Get your weapons
and man your battle stations!

01:32:41.104 --> 01:32:44.854
Check the 50s and 60s.
Make sure they're prepared and ready.

01:32:47.611 --> 01:32:50.281
- Come on!
- Move, move, move!

01:32:55.828 --> 01:33:00.988
- Don't let friendship keep you here any more.
- Don't worry.

01:33:40.373 --> 01:33:42.330
Get down.

01:35:49.084 --> 01:35:51.576
Give me a wire brush, Charlie.

01:35:51.670 --> 01:35:54.126
Looks like it hasn't been run
since World War I.

01:35:54.214 --> 01:35:56.291
Yeah, if then.

01:36:03.099 --> 01:36:07.013
OK, that ought to do it. Hold your breath.

01:36:10.772 --> 01:36:12.895
All right, hit the switch.

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.146
Got it.

01:36:21.325 --> 01:36:23.401
Go on, get somebody.

01:36:48.352 --> 01:36:49.811
Major Moreland.

01:36:58.695 --> 01:37:02.195
- You know you're responsible for that boy?
- It was an accident.

01:37:02.282 --> 01:37:04.690
I've gone to the mat with the civil authorities.

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:08.450
I'm urging them to take into consideration
your youth and the strain...

01:37:08.539 --> 01:37:12.406
Cut the bullshit.
Nobody in here's young any more.

01:37:12.501 --> 01:37:15.336
Excuse me if I don't shed tears
over your lost youth.

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:19.003
You've had your chances to toss it in.
You've got this chance.

01:37:19.091 --> 01:37:23.669
The governor is this close
to ordering us to take you in by force.

01:37:23.762 --> 01:37:26.253
When that order comes, I'll do it

01:37:26.348 --> 01:37:31.390
and you won't ever be that unhappy again.
I'll have to do it.

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:36.639
They want us to be good little boys now so
we can fight some war for them in the future.

01:37:36.733 --> 01:37:40.566
Some war they'll decide on.
We'd rather fight our own war right now.

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:46.443
Brian, we're talking about boys so young
they haven't got hair one between their legs.

01:37:46.536 --> 01:37:50.664
That's never been
any qualification for a soldier.

01:37:50.748 --> 01:37:52.456
Good Christ!

01:37:52.541 --> 01:37:57.666
The final stage of any mobilisation
is the children, the seed corn.

01:37:58.672 --> 01:38:04.461
What in God's name did they teach you
in here? What did they turn you into?

01:38:04.553 --> 01:38:06.760
A soldier. The only thing I ever wanted to be.

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:11.344
A soldier? No, goddammit, I'm a soldier,
with the career goal of all soldiers.

01:38:11.435 --> 01:38:17.604
I wanna stay alive in situations where it ain't
easy, but you, my friend, you're a death lover.

01:38:17.691 --> 01:38:20.147
I know the species.

01:38:20.236 --> 01:38:23.936
17 years old and some son of a bitch
has put you in love with death.

01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:27.530
Somebody sold you on the idea
that dying for a cause is romantic.

01:38:27.618 --> 01:38:31.830
Well, that is the worst kind
of all the kinds of bullshit there is!

01:38:31.914 --> 01:38:35.958
Dying is only one thing. Bad.

01:38:37.002 --> 01:38:40.454
Don't find that out. Please.

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:51.047
We'll reduce our demands to just one.

01:38:53.936 --> 01:38:56.178
I'm listening.

01:38:57.231 --> 01:38:59.437
A meeting with General Bache.

01:38:59.525 --> 01:39:02.858
Let the order come directly from him.
We'll obey.

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:11.357
General Bache died last night at six o'clock.

01:39:28.846 --> 01:39:31.135
You son of a bitch.

01:39:33.517 --> 01:39:37.052
You and I have nothing more to talk about.

01:40:20.147 --> 01:40:22.982
Company, halt!

01:40:32.201 --> 01:40:34.490
Left face!

01:40:40.459 --> 01:40:42.748
Firing detail, ready!

01:40:45.714 --> 01:40:48.834
Take aim! Fire!

01:40:49.051 --> 01:40:51.720
Take aim! Fire!

01:40:51.929 --> 01:40:54.384
Take aim! Fire!

01:41:57.245 --> 01:42:02.072
General Bache... prized this sword.

01:42:03.125 --> 01:42:09.329
It was given to him by General MacArthur
in appreciation of his service.

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:17.052
And he used to say
it was forged in the furnace of honour.

01:42:19.808 --> 01:42:25.395
What I know of honour I learned from him
and what I know of dignity I learned from him.

01:42:25.481 --> 01:42:30.189
He taught us
there are things worse than death.

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:33.862
Defeat, dishonour.

01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:46.868
General Bache,
we commit your spirit to eternity,

01:42:49.588 --> 01:42:52.625
to the company of great soldiers...

01:43:05.062 --> 01:43:07.388
and great souls.

01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:28.453
Company, left face!

01:43:39.388 --> 01:43:42.223
Forward march!

01:44:40.574 --> 01:44:44.524
How come they
knocked off the tapes, Charlie?

01:44:45.663 --> 01:44:48.118
I don't know.

01:44:49.625 --> 01:44:52.460
Probably just to keep us wondering.

01:44:55.464 --> 01:44:57.338
It's working.

01:44:59.552 --> 01:45:01.425
Yeah.

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:17.022
Charlie?

01:45:19.321 --> 01:45:21.563
I'm scared.

01:45:22.742 --> 01:45:25.861
I mean it. I'm really scared.

01:45:25.953 --> 01:45:28.278
We're all gonna get killed. I know it.

01:45:28.372 --> 01:45:33.367
No, we're not, Derek.
Try to think of something else.

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.919
I can't.

01:45:35.003 --> 01:45:37.958
Please, let's just give up, OK?

01:45:38.048 --> 01:45:40.966
I mean, we'll leave, OK? Please?

01:45:41.051 --> 01:45:44.385
- It'll be all right.
- No, it won't.

01:45:44.472 --> 01:45:48.339
- Close your eyes.
- I can't.

01:45:48.434 --> 01:45:51.055
Get low, Derek. Come on.

01:45:59.779 --> 01:46:03.361
- Derek! Derek, don't run!
- I don't wanna die!

01:46:03.449 --> 01:46:05.358
Derek! Don't run!

01:46:06.243 --> 01:46:08.651
<i>- Derek!
- Hold your fire!</i>

01:46:08.746 --> 01:46:10.406
Stop!

01:47:26.574 --> 01:47:29.824
You boys in here, this is the end of it.

01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:32.745
Right now, right here.

01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:35.285
You're coming out.
Someone finally had to die.

01:47:35.374 --> 01:47:37.746
Kerby, hold it right there!

01:47:37.834 --> 01:47:41.500
You will talk to our men through us.

01:47:41.588 --> 01:47:45.716
I want all of you boys to know
that at dawn we will take this campus.

01:47:45.801 --> 01:47:50.961
My men, our tanks, our helicopters,
we will take this campus.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.891
I don't want to see any more of you boys die.

01:47:54.977 --> 01:47:58.062
<i>Men, stand fast and listen up.</i>

01:47:58.146 --> 01:48:03.141
You are soldiers. You will continue
to follow the orders of your superior officers.

01:48:03.235 --> 01:48:07.778
- You will continue...
- Those who don't want this to happen,

01:48:07.865 --> 01:48:11.697
at dawn throw down your weapons
and run to the nearest National Guardsman.

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:16.910
We will do our best to protect you
and to see that you get out safely.

01:48:16.999 --> 01:48:20.249
Like they did Charlie! The bastards killed him!

01:48:27.134 --> 01:48:29.210
Mr Moreland!

01:48:31.847 --> 01:48:33.390
Dawn.

01:48:53.828 --> 01:48:55.619
I got a tank up here, Billy.

01:48:58.583 --> 01:49:00.824
Where's Moreland?

01:49:01.877 --> 01:49:05.044
- Bug, where's Moreland?
- I don't know.

01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:06.790
Not here.

01:49:07.842 --> 01:49:10.628
- Have you seen Shawn?
- No.

01:49:10.719 --> 01:49:13.293
They've all disappeared.

01:49:13.389 --> 01:49:15.796
I don't know where anybody is.

01:49:29.404 --> 01:49:31.729
<i>... honour, country.</i>

01:49:31.824 --> 01:49:35.524
<i>These are the virtues
instilled in a cadet at Bunker Hill.</i>

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:37.826
<i>They form the backbone of a curriculum</i>

01:49:37.913 --> 01:49:42.741
<i>which has produced a long and illustrious line
of soldiers and statesmen</i>

01:49:42.835 --> 01:49:48.458
<i>who have served the United States
with distinction since before the Civil War.</i>

01:49:49.008 --> 01:49:52.673
<i>At Bunker Hill
our goal is not only to educate the boy,</i>

01:49:52.762 --> 01:49:56.510
<i>it is to develop the man, to plumb potential,</i>

01:49:56.599 --> 01:50:02.637
<i>to nurture it in an atmosphere
of strict discipline and intensive training.</i>

01:50:03.147 --> 01:50:05.389
<i>Those boys who are dedicated</i>

01:50:05.482 --> 01:50:11.188
<i>often fiind acceptance to West Point,
Annapolis or the Air Force Academy, where...</i>

01:50:23.625 --> 01:50:26.331
I was thinking about Charlie.

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:34.042
You know, he came in here
scared of his own shadow, homesick.

01:50:35.346 --> 01:50:37.837
Used to cry himself to sleep.

01:50:39.725 --> 01:50:44.932
I was betting he wouldn't last
the first week of orientation.

01:50:45.022 --> 01:50:50.099
You'd call "Right face"
and he'd go in the other direction.

01:50:52.488 --> 01:50:56.735
And by Thanksgiving he was calling cadence.

01:50:56.826 --> 01:51:03.078
Never got a hit in inspection.
He turned out to be a tough little kid.

01:51:07.086 --> 01:51:10.585
Always so eager to please.

01:51:40.036 --> 01:51:42.740
It's getting close to dawn.

01:51:45.333 --> 01:51:47.906
That plebe year, it's a tough time.

01:51:48.002 --> 01:51:50.078
Yeah, it is.

01:51:51.463 --> 01:51:56.588
Some of them, like Charlie, thrive on it.

01:51:58.429 --> 01:52:02.261
I did. I... I thrived on it.

01:52:06.103 --> 01:52:08.938
I can't remember why any more.

01:52:12.568 --> 01:52:21.406
I was thinking about that basketball game
we played, one on one, last winter.

01:52:24.997 --> 01:52:27.404
It was so cold,

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:32.790
hurt to breathe, and your fingers
could barely feel the ball, you know.

01:52:33.797 --> 01:52:35.874
There was no net on the hoop.

01:52:35.966 --> 01:52:42.218
We were always arguing the other's shot
didn't go in. Laughing and acting crazy

01:52:46.769 --> 01:52:53.056
It was so dark you couldn't see the ball
against the backboard. I love that feeling.

01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:55.937
We'll have a rematch, one on one.

01:53:02.701 --> 01:53:05.537
It's gonna hurt like hell to leave it all behind.

01:53:05.621 --> 01:53:10.366
No one leaves it all behind, Brian.
We're gonna take it with us.

01:53:10.459 --> 01:53:13.128
Were they just words?

01:53:14.296 --> 01:53:16.966
Honour, duty, country?

01:53:22.346 --> 01:53:24.671
I loved that man.

01:53:26.141 --> 01:53:30.887
Being in his presence
made me feel privileged.

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:46.323
But there had to be something missing
in all that he taught us,

01:53:46.412 --> 01:53:49.117
or this wouldn't have happened.

01:54:17.067 --> 01:54:21.279
I... I've done a terrible thing here.

01:54:21.363 --> 01:54:25.278
You weren't alone. We were all in it together.

01:54:28.287 --> 01:54:31.822
It was my command and I was in charge.

01:54:33.625 --> 01:54:36.496
When I knelt next to Charlie,

01:54:37.671 --> 01:54:41.539
I tried to find some justification.

01:54:42.551 --> 01:54:46.679
But honour doesn't count for shit
when you're looking at a dead little boy.

01:54:46.764 --> 01:54:53.016
You don't think of the book of remembrance
or bugles or flags or 21-gun salutes.

01:54:59.693 --> 01:55:05.946
All you think about
is what a neat little kid he was...

01:55:09.245 --> 01:55:11.949
and how you're gonna miss him.

01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:35.051
Declare a victory, Brian.

01:55:40.067 --> 01:55:42.558
Let's say we won the war.

01:55:42.653 --> 01:55:44.729
Let's go home.

01:56:52.431 --> 01:56:55.883
<i>Fall in! Fall in! It's over!</i>

01:56:55.977 --> 01:56:57.352
Fall in.

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.102
Fall in! It's over!

01:57:06.529 --> 01:57:09.364
Fall in! Let's go!

01:57:11.534 --> 01:57:14.106
Fall in! It's over!

01:57:16.038 --> 01:57:18.114
Let's go! Fall in!

01:57:19.375 --> 01:57:21.451
Fall in!

01:57:22.711 --> 01:57:27.124
- Let's go, Lyle. Fall in.
- Bring them up from the parade field.

01:57:29.969 --> 01:57:31.961
Fall in.

01:57:32.972 --> 01:57:34.514
It's over.

01:57:40.938 --> 01:57:43.725
Let's go, Frank. Fall in.

01:57:45.151 --> 01:57:48.769
- Tell 'em to fall in.
- Fall in, guys.

01:57:48.862 --> 01:57:50.938
Bring it down.

01:57:52.241 --> 01:57:54.317
Rusty!

01:57:55.661 --> 01:57:57.784
- Fall in.
- Yes, sir!

01:57:58.372 --> 01:58:02.666
Fall in! Fall in down in the quad. It's over.

01:58:02.751 --> 01:58:06.417
Fall in! It's over! It's over!

01:58:06.505 --> 01:58:08.249
Fall in!

01:58:39.705 --> 01:58:43.121
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

01:58:44.084 --> 01:58:47.085
Hold your fire!

01:58:52.092 --> 01:58:53.172
Shawn!

01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:56.760
Calling chopper two. Lay down the smoke!

01:59:18.035 --> 01:59:20.407
Shawn! Dammit!

01:59:45.187 --> 01:59:47.263
Move out! Let's go!

01:59:51.068 --> 01:59:53.737
<i>Stay inside! Keep clear!</i>

02:00:02.037 --> 02:00:04.742
- Shit!
- Shawn!

02:00:04.832 --> 02:00:07.370
It's beautiful, man! Beautiful!

02:02:32.479 --> 02:02:35.599
Eyes right!

02:02:40.696 --> 02:02:43.567
Eyes right!

02:02:43.783 --> 02:02:45.858
Eyes right!

02:02:53.875 --> 02:02:56.793
Company, turn!

02:03:01.634 --> 02:03:03.709
Eyes right!

02:03:13.937 --> 02:03:16.096
Eyes right!

02:03:22.404 --> 02:03:24.480
Eyes right!
