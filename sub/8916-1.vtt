02:26.815 --> 02:29.475
She's denied the cross for suicide...

02:29.585 --> 02:33.035
and buried at the
center of a crossroads. Huh.

02:33.155 --> 02:36.815
Show me the logic. Father?

02:36.925 --> 02:38.825
What?

02:38.925 --> 02:41.895
The devil is a practical man.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.984
If she were a witch, she was
a poor return on his investment.

02:45.094 --> 02:46.994
What would you know of logic?

02:47.094 --> 02:52.334
Oh, I have ears, Father. Although
one is notched because I love justice.

02:52.434 --> 02:54.424
You love thieving.

02:54.534 --> 02:56.474
Shut up. You dig.

03:20.293 --> 03:22.423
Crusaders.

03:26.803 --> 03:29.333
Clear the road, if you will.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.133
Squire! Hyah!

03:59.502 --> 04:01.762
This is for the burial from my lord...

04:01.872 --> 04:03.562
and a Mass...

04:03.672 --> 04:05.802
for her soul.

04:10.212 --> 04:12.112
Wait.

04:12.212 --> 04:15.082
Have you forgotten?
She was your brother's wife.

04:15.182 --> 04:17.082
She was a suicide. Cut off her head.

04:17.182 --> 04:19.952
And return the ax.

04:34.771 --> 04:36.741
You know this place, my lord?

04:37.841 --> 04:39.811
Know it?

04:39.911 --> 04:42.001
I know all of it.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.011
Your brother? You have spoken to him?

04:49.121 --> 04:51.781
On what matter, my lord?
He is still arrested.

04:51.891 --> 04:55.881
Your brother is as responsible
for his wife's sin as I am.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.391
Opinions differ, my lord.

04:58.491 --> 05:01.761
The burial was... Yes.

05:01.861 --> 05:04.851
And you did not mutilate the person? No.

05:04.961 --> 05:08.760
Good. The law can go too far.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.960
It can too far. I ask myself...

05:11.070 --> 05:13.540
"Would Jesus do it thusly?"

05:13.640 --> 05:17.370
There is so much done in Christendom
of which Christ would be incapable.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.910
You must release your brother.
I cannot do without him.

05:20.010 --> 05:24.640
My-My brother, my lord bishop,
uh, is possessed by the devil...

05:24.750 --> 05:27.950
and must be... examined.

05:28.050 --> 05:31.420
Your brother is as mad as you are.
He grieves.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.550
Without your brother,
I cannot finish my church.

05:33.660 --> 05:36.290
Let him out. And give him this.

05:36.400 --> 05:41.389
And tell him that he is at
the very center of my prayers.

06:34.948 --> 06:37.048
The bishop needs you.

06:37.158 --> 06:39.848
Release him. On your feet.

06:39.958 --> 06:43.728
This is not heaven. It's the world.

06:43.828 --> 06:45.888
And there's troubles in it.

07:03.317 --> 07:05.437
Do yourself no injury.

07:05.547 --> 07:08.177
Other men are always good for that.

07:26.937 --> 07:30.066
And what of Jerusalem? Jerusalem?

07:30.176 --> 07:33.336
In peril, my lord, as always.

07:33.446 --> 07:36.236
We have stood there against the
Saracens for over a hundred years.

07:36.346 --> 07:40.116
The Saracens, as you call them,
have now unified in Egypt...

07:40.216 --> 07:43.016
Syria and all Arabia.

07:43.116 --> 07:45.146
Saracens and someone new.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.516
Saladin, the king.

07:48.626 --> 07:51.616
Gibberish.

07:53.596 --> 07:57.926
Very fine. And yet, you do not drink.

07:58.036 --> 08:00.006
A knight should be a knight...

08:00.106 --> 08:02.336
a monk a monk. Brother.

08:02.436 --> 08:05.135
Not both. One, that's what I say.

08:05.235 --> 08:10.605
Now I may be old-fashioned,
but, as for the cup...

08:10.715 --> 08:14.775
I have, uh, an artificer, uh, a blacksmith.

08:14.885 --> 08:18.545
Or did have.

08:18.655 --> 08:23.025
Which son of the blacksmith
of my time is the blacksmith now?

08:23.125 --> 08:25.855
Balian, the eldest.

08:25.965 --> 08:27.985
His child died.

08:28.095 --> 08:31.625
His wife fell into a melancholy.
She would not listen to reason.

08:31.735 --> 08:36.835
She killed herself... it occurs.

08:36.934 --> 08:40.333
But what's that to you?

08:40.443 --> 08:42.404
Private matter.

08:48.314 --> 08:50.844
It's been six and 20 years
since my brother took the cross.

08:50.954 --> 08:56.584
Now he returns an actual
baron of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

08:56.694 --> 08:59.314
How is that for the lot
of the younger brother?

08:59.424 --> 09:04.024
With no heir, comes to me and thus to you.

09:04.134 --> 09:06.824
Then I thank the stars for my uncle.

09:29.793 --> 09:31.813
Go on.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.363
Her grave was here.

09:40.463 --> 09:43.363
Or was it there?

09:43.473 --> 09:46.733
I'm afraid I can't tell
you the exact location.

09:46.843 --> 09:49.172
I wasn't present at the burial.

09:52.242 --> 09:54.142
Call me a liar.

09:54.242 --> 09:56.542
You have reason.

10:00.652 --> 10:02.622
You never fight back.

10:07.262 --> 10:09.222
Hmm? Hmm?

10:10.862 --> 10:12.832
You always turn the other cheek.

10:12.932 --> 10:16.022
I think that you
conceive yourself without sin.

10:17.302 --> 10:19.332
That is a sin!

11:33.680 --> 11:35.639
We shall work.

11:57.599 --> 12:01.089
I told you to stop that now!

12:09.279 --> 12:11.838
That is the man. That is the man.

12:11.948 --> 12:14.508
You're an armorer, yes?

12:14.618 --> 12:18.048
An artificer according to
your lord and this priest.

12:18.148 --> 12:21.058
You have my sympathy and my blessing.

12:21.158 --> 12:25.648
Your dead wife and stillborn child
are today the subject of my prayers.

12:26.858 --> 12:29.418
We need all these horses shod.

12:29.528 --> 12:32.588
We need food, and we'll pay.

12:34.868 --> 12:36.808
Says yes.

12:36.908 --> 12:39.528
Have you killed any? Have you killed any?

12:45.818 --> 12:48.147
He has made great engines for sieges.

12:50.647 --> 12:54.087
He has made war machines
that cast the largest stones.

12:54.187 --> 12:57.247
He also works finely in silver.

12:58.957 --> 13:02.397
He will be one of the few on your
journey worth more alive than dead.

13:02.497 --> 13:04.557
Shut up.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.467
Have you been at war?

13:13.577 --> 13:17.947
On horse. And as an enginer also.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.017
Against whom and for whom did you fight?

13:20.117 --> 13:21.976
For one lord against another...

13:22.076 --> 13:24.916
on a point which cannot be remembered.

13:25.016 --> 13:28.506
There's better game now...
one god against another.

13:28.616 --> 13:31.856
The pay is proportionate.
I've been telling him that.

14:23.105 --> 14:26.235
Do you still advise what
you advised upon the road?

14:27.345 --> 14:29.815
I do, my lord.

14:29.915 --> 14:33.874
But know that this man
Balian mourns his wife.

14:44.494 --> 14:46.364
What does that say?

14:46.464 --> 14:50.234
"What man is a man who does
not make the world better?"

14:50.334 --> 14:52.304
Leave me with this man.

14:59.474 --> 15:03.504
God has made us man. We must suffer all.

15:04.714 --> 15:06.844
I also have lost.

15:13.723 --> 15:18.953
Some say Jerusalem is the very
center of the world for asking forgiveness.

15:19.063 --> 15:22.693
For myself, I call it here.

15:22.803 --> 15:24.763
Now.

15:36.043 --> 15:38.203
I knew your namesake.

15:45.322 --> 15:48.622
I knew your mother.

15:51.922 --> 15:56.332
To be courteous, I should say
that it was against her objections.

15:56.432 --> 15:59.832
But I was the lord's
brother and she had no choice.

15:59.932 --> 16:03.162
But I did not force her.

16:11.042 --> 16:13.672
I have forgiveness to ask of you.

16:33.031 --> 16:36.491
I am Godfrey, the baron of Ibelin.

16:36.601 --> 16:39.591
I have 100 men at arms in Jerusalem.

16:39.711 --> 16:43.611
If you will come with me,
you will have a living...

16:43.711 --> 16:46.611
and... you will have my thanks.

16:46.711 --> 16:48.771
There it is.

16:48.881 --> 16:51.181
Whoever you are, my lord...

16:51.281 --> 16:53.151
my place is here.

16:53.251 --> 16:56.550
What made it your place is now dead.

17:02.430 --> 17:05.260
You will never see me again.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.990
If you want anything of me, take it now.

17:10.369 --> 17:12.300
I want nothing.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.030
I am sorry for your troubles.
God protect you.

17:36.799 --> 17:38.919
Jerusalem is easy to find.

17:39.029 --> 17:42.159
You come to where the men speak Italian...

17:42.269 --> 17:45.069
then continue until they
speak something else.

17:45.169 --> 17:48.539
We go by Messina. Good-bye.

18:26.248 --> 18:28.508
The village does not want you.

18:31.078 --> 18:34.638
When the old lord is dead,
they will drive you out.

18:39.388 --> 18:43.257
When the bishop is dead, it is certain.

18:43.357 --> 18:45.457
And you take my property.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.857
The Church. You.

18:47.967 --> 18:50.487
They would have taken you to Jerusalem...

18:50.597 --> 18:53.797
away from... all this.

18:53.907 --> 18:55.867
I arranged it.

18:59.447 --> 19:01.347
I swear to you...

19:01.447 --> 19:04.907
you will have no peace
so long as you stay here.

19:06.287 --> 19:09.477
No man ever needed a new world more.

19:09.587 --> 19:14.617
Imagine your sin and pain erased.

19:14.727 --> 19:17.286
All.

19:28.566 --> 19:31.476
If you take the Crusade...

19:31.576 --> 19:34.666
you may relieve your
wife's position in hell.

19:34.776 --> 19:39.766
I put it delicately...
She was a suicide. She is in hell.

19:41.186 --> 19:43.276
Though what she does there without a head...

21:03.663 --> 21:05.853
Wait here.

21:21.643 --> 21:23.613
Have you come to kill me?

21:23.713 --> 21:27.443
Even these days, it is not easy.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.543
Well?

21:36.163 --> 21:38.132
I have done...

21:40.632 --> 21:42.602
murder.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.832
Haven't we all?

21:44.932 --> 21:46.832
Is it true...

21:46.942 --> 21:50.272
that in Jerusalem I can erase my sins...

21:50.372 --> 21:52.342
and those of my wife?

21:52.442 --> 21:54.342
Is it true?

21:54.442 --> 21:56.912
We can find out together.

21:58.782 --> 22:01.412
Show me your hand.

22:18.601 --> 22:20.931
Hey!

22:50.130 --> 22:54.070
Pick it up. Let's see what you're
made of. His hand is hurt, my lord.

22:54.170 --> 22:57.730
I once fought two days with an
arrow through my testicle. Ah, yes.

23:06.780 --> 23:10.220
Never use a low guard. You fight well.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.290
Let's work on your skills.

23:17.890 --> 23:20.420
Take a high guard, like this.

23:20.530 --> 23:24.399
The Italians call it la poste di falcone...
the guard of the hawk.

23:24.499 --> 23:26.559
Strike from high, like this.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.739
Do it.

23:30.839 --> 23:33.099
Sword straighter. Come on.

23:33.209 --> 23:36.439
Leg back, bend your knees. Sword straighter.

23:38.579 --> 23:40.839
Defend yourself.

23:42.349 --> 23:44.839
The blade isn't the only part of a sword.

23:49.319 --> 23:51.519
Attack.

23:59.498 --> 24:01.228
I have your leave?

24:07.538 --> 24:09.698
Pay attention.

24:31.668 --> 24:33.457
What's this?

24:44.347 --> 24:46.247
Uncle. Nephew.

24:46.347 --> 24:50.307
You have with you a man, Balian,
who killed a priest, his brother.

24:50.417 --> 24:54.817
I'm charged by both my father and
the lord bishop to bring him back.

25:02.927 --> 25:04.957
What he says is true.

25:05.067 --> 25:07.037
They have the right to take me.

25:07.137 --> 25:08.826
I say he is innocent of the charge.

25:08.936 --> 25:13.766
If you say he's guilty, then we'll fight,
and God will decide the truth of it.

25:13.876 --> 25:17.536
My German friend is a
close student of the law.

25:17.646 --> 25:20.436
Just give him to me.
I'll fight you for something else.

25:20.546 --> 25:23.446
Uncle, he's a murderer.

25:23.546 --> 25:25.516
So am I.

25:29.286 --> 25:33.556
Whoever dies here today,
you will certainly be among them.

25:33.656 --> 25:38.216
You are my uncle. I must give you the road.

25:38.326 --> 25:39.816
Hyah! Hyah!

25:50.405 --> 25:52.135
Heinrich!

25:52.245 --> 25:54.075
Aah!

25:54.175 --> 25:56.235
To the flanks!

26:09.295 --> 26:11.595
Aah!

26:16.465 --> 26:18.225
Hyah! Aah!

27:31.872 --> 27:34.242
Hyah! Come on!

27:35.672 --> 27:38.012
Hyah!

28:02.132 --> 28:05.302
Thank my brother for his love!

28:43.640 --> 28:45.540
I am the son of Roger...

28:45.640 --> 28:47.840
Take your helmet off while addressing me.

28:56.820 --> 28:59.920
I'm am the son of Roger de Cormiere.

29:05.700 --> 29:09.430
I am accorded the privilege of ransom.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.130
This is true.

29:49.339 --> 29:51.938
Ah. Well, you broke the arrow.

29:54.378 --> 29:59.248
If the ribs are broken,
some marrow may enter the blood...

29:59.348 --> 30:03.218
in which case you'll take a fever and die.

30:03.318 --> 30:05.478
Or a cyst will form...

30:05.588 --> 30:07.558
and you'll live.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.398
You're in the hands of God.

30:11.498 --> 30:14.118
Get me some more wine.

30:25.608 --> 30:27.737
It was not...

30:27.847 --> 30:30.107
that they had no right to take you.

30:30.217 --> 30:32.977
It was the way they asked.

30:33.077 --> 30:35.307
They had the right to take me.

30:37.787 --> 30:40.017
So do I.

30:54.437 --> 30:59.737
To kill an infidel,
the pope has said, is not murder.

30:59.837 --> 31:02.137
It is the path to heaven.

31:02.247 --> 31:06.476
To kill an infidel,
the pope has said, is not murder.

31:06.576 --> 31:09.636
It is the path to heaven.

31:09.746 --> 31:12.216
Godfrey.

31:14.486 --> 31:18.716
To kill an infidel,
the pope has said, is not murder.

31:18.826 --> 31:20.196
It is the path to heaven.

31:28.336 --> 31:31.796
Where do you go? To Jerusalem, brother.

31:31.906 --> 31:35.676
By which road? Someone knows.

31:35.776 --> 31:37.806
God knows.

31:51.255 --> 31:53.725
When shall we stop this madness?

31:53.825 --> 31:56.425
It will soon be beyond my concern.

32:03.435 --> 32:05.665
Who is this?

32:07.375 --> 32:09.705
My son.

32:13.075 --> 32:17.774
Would I have fought you when you
were still capable of making bastards.

32:19.914 --> 32:22.944
I knew your mother when she was making hers.

32:23.054 --> 32:26.454
Fortunately, you're
too old to be one of mine.

32:28.764 --> 32:31.284
All will be settled.

33:30.052 --> 33:31.952
Do you know...

33:32.052 --> 33:34.282
what lies in the Holy Land?

33:35.392 --> 33:37.022
A new world.

33:37.132 --> 33:40.562
A man who, in France, had not a house...

33:40.662 --> 33:43.832
is, in the Holy Land, the master of a city.

33:43.932 --> 33:48.272
He who was the master
of a city begs in the gutter.

33:48.372 --> 33:50.802
There, at the end of the world...

33:50.912 --> 33:53.812
you are not what you were born...

33:53.912 --> 33:57.002
but what you have it in yourself to be.

33:57.112 --> 33:59.342
I hope to find forgiveness.

33:59.451 --> 34:01.381
That's all I know.

34:05.091 --> 34:08.781
Whatever your position,
you are of my house...

34:08.891 --> 34:12.420
and that means you will
serve the king of Jerusalem.

34:12.531 --> 34:15.501
What could a king ask of a man like me?

34:17.071 --> 34:21.161
A better world than has ever been seen.

34:21.271 --> 34:23.241
A kingdom of conscience.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.371
A kingdom of heaven.

34:26.471 --> 34:29.771
There is peace between Christian and Muslim.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.741
We live together.

34:31.851 --> 34:36.250
Or, between Saladin and the king, we try.

34:36.350 --> 34:41.150
Did you think that lay
at the end of Crusade?

34:41.260 --> 34:43.489
It does.

34:43.590 --> 34:46.489
My son, you are all that survives me.

34:46.590 --> 34:49.190
Do not disappoint me.

34:53.900 --> 34:57.670
When we took the Holy Land,
we took the Saracen trading ports.

34:57.770 --> 35:03.180
Italian ships carry silks and spices
and pilgrims, if they have money.

35:06.450 --> 35:10.249
And Italy becomes rich
as the Savior intended.

35:14.319 --> 35:16.519
Who are those men?

35:16.619 --> 35:20.059
Muslims. Saracens.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.459
And they're allowed their prayers?

35:22.559 --> 35:25.259
If they pay the tax.

35:25.369 --> 35:27.229
Subhena Rabi Alladin.

35:27.339 --> 35:31.529
Praise be to God.
It is proper to praise him.

35:32.569 --> 35:34.909
Sounds like our prayers.

35:41.349 --> 35:43.249
It's good.

35:51.528 --> 35:53.458
When the king is dead...

35:53.558 --> 35:57.048
Jerusalem will be no
place for friends of Muslims...

35:57.168 --> 36:00.028
or traitors to Christendom...

36:00.128 --> 36:02.728
like your father.

36:02.838 --> 36:06.028
I am Guy de Lusignan.

36:07.338 --> 36:09.808
Remember that name.

36:09.908 --> 36:11.938
And me.

36:16.048 --> 36:19.248
- Keep it.
- My lord.

36:21.917 --> 36:25.187
How will you ride if you have
no stick to beat the horse?

36:28.697 --> 36:31.427
He will be king in Jerusalem one day.

36:34.267 --> 36:36.457
Holy mother of God, pray for us...

36:36.567 --> 36:38.537
now and at the hour of our death.

36:45.507 --> 36:47.477
Balian.

36:52.517 --> 36:54.887
Hurry.

37:04.026 --> 37:06.056
I can go no further.

37:15.076 --> 37:17.566
Get on your knees.

37:39.325 --> 37:42.325
Be without fear in the face of your enemies.

37:42.435 --> 37:45.925
Be brave and upright that God may love thee.

37:46.035 --> 37:50.305
Speak the truth always,
even if it leads to your death.

37:50.405 --> 37:54.935
Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong.

37:55.045 --> 37:57.745
That is your oath.

38:05.355 --> 38:07.514
And that's so you remember it.

38:15.964 --> 38:19.124
Arise a knight and baron of Ibelin.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.044
Defend the king.

38:34.154 --> 38:36.204
I- If the king is no more...

38:36.314 --> 38:38.284
protect the people.

38:40.394 --> 38:44.193
It is time now, my lord, to
confess to holy God, not your son.

38:46.063 --> 38:48.533
Are you sorry for all your sins?

38:48.633 --> 38:50.593
For all but one.

39:15.623 --> 39:20.682
You sail now for Jerusalem, as your
father wished. I'll follow within the week.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.022
Now the voyage is perilous.

39:23.132 --> 39:28.002
If God has purpose for you there,
he'll keep you safe in his hands.

39:28.102 --> 39:30.072
If not...

39:31.142 --> 39:33.102
God bless you.

42:26.137 --> 42:28.037
Whoa. Whoa.

42:28.147 --> 42:30.197
Whoa.

42:55.466 --> 42:57.836
He says that is his horse.

42:57.936 --> 43:00.636
Why would it be his horse?

43:00.746 --> 43:02.506
Because it is on his land!

43:02.606 --> 43:05.706
I took this horse from the sea.

43:14.656 --> 43:16.846
He says you are a great liar...

43:16.956 --> 43:19.856
and he will fight you
because you are a liar.

43:19.956 --> 43:22.356
I have no desire to fight.

43:22.466 --> 43:24.396
Then you must give him the horse.

43:30.265 --> 43:31.755
No.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.855
Fight me fairly!

43:46.955 --> 43:49.215
Why? Why should he?

43:49.325 --> 43:52.725
He is a knight.
And I am the baron of Ibelin.

44:00.665 --> 44:03.564
He says the baron of Ibelin is old.

44:03.664 --> 44:06.224
He knew him at Damascus.

44:06.334 --> 44:08.304
I am the new one.

44:30.094 --> 44:32.394
Stop!

44:35.534 --> 44:39.233
Ibelin, that's enough! Ibelin, no!

45:00.053 --> 45:03.653
You have taken it very well
that I have killed your master.

45:03.763 --> 45:06.233
It was the end of his time.

45:07.733 --> 45:09.703
All is as God wills it.

45:12.932 --> 45:15.492
Now finish this.

45:32.492 --> 45:35.112
Take me to Jerusalem.

46:37.150 --> 46:38.950
Very good horse.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.560
Take the horse...

46:43.660 --> 46:46.020
and be about your business.

46:46.130 --> 46:49.530
This is your prize of battle.

46:49.630 --> 46:52.570
I am your prisoner...
your slave, should you wish it.

46:52.670 --> 46:55.760
I have been a slave, or very near to one.

46:55.870 --> 46:58.459
I will never keep one,
nor suffer any to be kept.

46:58.569 --> 47:00.439
Go.

47:08.119 --> 47:12.449
The man you killed was a very
great cavalier among the Muslims.

47:12.549 --> 47:14.709
His name was Mummad al Fais.

47:14.819 --> 47:16.979
I will pray for him.

47:17.089 --> 47:20.689
Your quality will be
known among your enemies...

47:20.789 --> 47:23.559
before ever you meet them, my friend.

47:33.838 --> 47:38.468
Old man, where is it
that Christ was crucified?

47:57.698 --> 47:59.758
Salaam alaikum.

48:21.787 --> 48:25.617
God, what is it you want of me?

49:02.256 --> 49:05.786
How can you be in hell
when you're in my heart?

49:49.265 --> 49:52.795
You must have known him. What?

49:52.905 --> 49:56.764
Since you carry Godfrey's sword,
you must have known him.

49:59.204 --> 50:01.104
I did.

50:01.204 --> 50:02.834
A man my size?

50:07.714 --> 50:09.654
Yes.

50:09.754 --> 50:11.874
And green eyes.

50:16.224 --> 50:18.194
Blue.

50:24.534 --> 50:27.194
Come with us...

50:27.304 --> 50:29.564
my lord.

50:51.993 --> 50:54.763
No. Give me the towel.

50:54.863 --> 50:57.363
Give me the towel. Give me the towel.

51:30.302 --> 51:32.792
A man who, in France, had not a house...

51:32.902 --> 51:35.872
is, in the Holy Land, the master of a city.

52:07.241 --> 52:09.601
Stop.

52:09.711 --> 52:11.641
You're hurting him.

52:11.741 --> 52:15.401
Whoa. Whoa.

52:31.590 --> 52:34.360
Where's your master?

52:34.460 --> 52:36.090
I have none.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.170
Give me some water.

52:53.719 --> 52:56.689
Thank you for the drink.

52:58.719 --> 53:02.349
If you happen to see Balian,
the son of Godfrey...

53:02.459 --> 53:04.359
tell him that Sibylla called.

53:15.639 --> 53:18.539
So, how find you Jerusalem?

53:18.639 --> 53:20.729
God does not speak to me.

53:20.839 --> 53:23.209
Not even on the hill...

53:23.309 --> 53:25.299
where Christ died.

53:25.409 --> 53:27.578
I am outside God's grace.

53:27.678 --> 53:29.808
I have not heard that.

53:29.918 --> 53:32.578
At any rate, it seems...

53:33.688 --> 53:35.678
I have lost my religion.

53:35.788 --> 53:38.728
I put no stock in religion.

53:38.828 --> 53:40.488
By the word "religion"...

53:40.598 --> 53:44.398
I've seen the lunacy of fanatics of every
denomination be called the will of God.

53:44.498 --> 53:49.158
I've seen too much religion in
the eyes of too many murderers.

53:49.268 --> 53:51.068
Holiness...

53:51.168 --> 53:53.108
is in right action...

53:53.208 --> 53:57.938
and courage on behalf of those
who cannot defend themselves.

53:58.048 --> 54:00.038
And goodness...

54:02.987 --> 54:04.917
what God desires...

54:05.017 --> 54:08.887
is here and here.

54:08.987 --> 54:13.047
By what you decide to do
every day, you will be a good man.

54:14.157 --> 54:16.057
Or not.

54:16.167 --> 54:18.187
Come.

54:42.686 --> 54:46.026
The king has made a peace with
Saladin these past six years.

54:46.126 --> 54:50.216
He holds Jerusalem as a
place for prayer for all faiths...

54:50.326 --> 54:53.026
as the Muslims did before we came.

54:53.136 --> 54:56.426
These men are Templars. They killed Arabs.

55:03.046 --> 55:05.776
So they are dying...

55:05.876 --> 55:08.036
for what the pope would command them to do.

55:08.146 --> 55:11.636
Yes. But not Christ, I think.

55:11.746 --> 55:13.715
Nor this king.

55:25.965 --> 55:28.195
Who says I raid?

55:28.295 --> 55:29.965
That witness...

55:30.065 --> 55:33.235
all of Jerusalem...

55:33.335 --> 55:35.825
holy God and me.

55:35.945 --> 55:41.205
That witness, if you call him
that, is a Saracen. He lies.

55:41.315 --> 55:43.375
There will come a day,
Reynald de Chatillon...

55:43.485 --> 55:46.605
when you are not protected by your title.

55:46.715 --> 55:49.314
Oh? When will that be?

55:49.424 --> 55:51.584
Alert me, Tiberias, when men are equal...

55:51.684 --> 55:53.814
and the kingdom of heaven has arrived.

55:53.924 --> 55:57.824
Those Templars have been hung
for a raid that I know you commanded.

55:57.924 --> 56:00.124
Prove it.

56:00.234 --> 56:02.464
I will wait at Kerak until you do.

56:02.564 --> 56:06.764
The king will take your
castle of Kerak, Reynald.

56:06.874 --> 56:09.064
Try to take it, Tiberias.

56:09.174 --> 56:11.234
I'll be there.

56:18.614 --> 56:23.174
I cannot protect your caravans unless
you agree to be escorted by our soldiers.

56:23.284 --> 56:25.183
I trade to make money...

56:25.283 --> 56:28.523
not to offend God by
associating with Christians.

56:28.623 --> 56:32.653
But you will take Christian gold.
Gold is gold.

56:34.093 --> 56:36.363
Mmm. Of course.

56:39.473 --> 56:41.373
My lord Tiberias.

56:50.043 --> 56:51.703
My lord.

56:54.183 --> 56:56.743
It's true.

56:56.853 --> 56:58.753
You're your father's son.

56:58.853 --> 57:01.252
He was my friend.

57:01.352 --> 57:03.912
I am yours.

57:04.022 --> 57:05.922
Godfrey dead.

57:06.032 --> 57:08.932
It could have come at a better time. Come.

57:10.632 --> 57:14.622
It was shouted in the streets
that you killed a great lord of Syria.

57:14.732 --> 57:18.072
Saladin himself sent word...

57:18.172 --> 57:20.762
that your fight did not breach the peace...

57:20.872 --> 57:22.812
that you had cause.

57:23.982 --> 57:26.712
What know you of Saladin?

57:26.812 --> 57:28.712
That he is king of the Saracens...

57:28.812 --> 57:31.042
and that he surrounds this kingdom.

57:31.152 --> 57:34.551
He has 200,000 men in Damascus alone.

57:34.651 --> 57:37.551
He could win a war if he goes to war...

57:37.661 --> 57:42.651
and he's daily given cause for
war by fanatics newly from Europe...

57:42.761 --> 57:45.421
by Templar bastards
like Reynald de Chatillon.

57:45.531 --> 57:49.591
Here, from this room, I keep
the peace, so far as it can be kept.

57:49.701 --> 57:53.801
But Saladin and the king between them...

57:53.911 --> 57:56.741
would make a better world.

57:56.841 --> 58:00.471
If it lives only for a while,
Tiberias, it still has lived.

58:00.581 --> 58:02.551
All right.

58:05.181 --> 58:09.421
What did your father tell
you of your... obligations?

58:09.521 --> 58:11.490
That I was to be a good knight.

58:13.390 --> 58:15.260
I pray the world...

58:15.360 --> 58:17.520
and Jerusalem...

58:17.630 --> 58:21.290
can accommodate such a rarity...

58:22.400 --> 58:24.370
as a perfect knight.

58:28.540 --> 58:30.200
Have you dined?

58:37.580 --> 58:39.920
The Princess Sibylla of Jerusalem...

58:40.020 --> 58:42.580
and her husband, Guy de Lusignan.

58:53.499 --> 58:56.629
So, how many knights did you find in France?

58:56.739 --> 58:59.029
Fifty.

58:59.139 --> 59:00.999
They've sworn allegiance to the king?

59:01.109 --> 59:03.509
Of course, Tiberias.

59:03.609 --> 59:05.579
Obviously.

59:09.519 --> 59:12.479
You sit at my table?

59:12.579 --> 59:17.389
Is it not the king's table? Is it?
I have not seen a king at it for some years.

59:18.859 --> 59:22.658
I cannot eat.
I... I am finicky about company.

59:22.758 --> 59:26.088
In France this could not inherit.

59:26.198 --> 59:29.758
But here there are no civilized rules.

59:29.868 --> 59:31.768
I have business in the East.

59:33.838 --> 59:38.168
My wife does not lament my absences.

59:38.278 --> 59:41.768
That is either the best of wives...

59:41.878 --> 59:45.008
or the very, very worst.

59:45.118 --> 59:48.778
Do you go to meet Reynald?
No, my lord. He is in disfavor.

59:48.888 --> 59:51.188
I am a member of this court.

59:51.288 --> 59:55.348
Why should I make league
with that... troublemaker?

01:00:02.127 --> 01:00:05.037
To the very best of wives.

01:00:05.137 --> 01:00:08.367
God bless Jerusalem.

01:00:08.467 --> 01:00:11.197
My lord, the king will see him now.

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:13.367
The king would see Godfrey's son.

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:15.067
I'll take him.

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:20.047
This morning I spoke
without knowing who you were.

01:00:20.147 --> 01:00:23.917
I knew who you were. It's unmistakable.

01:00:24.017 --> 01:00:26.147
I loved your father...

01:00:26.257 --> 01:00:28.227
and I shall love you.

01:00:32.126 --> 01:00:34.096
Do you fear being with me?

01:00:34.196 --> 01:00:36.166
No.

01:00:37.866 --> 01:00:40.236
And yes.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:44.826
A woman in my place has two faces.

01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:47.376
One for the world...

01:00:47.476 --> 01:00:50.406
and one which she wears in private.

01:00:50.516 --> 01:00:53.076
With you I'll be only Sibylla.

01:00:58.386 --> 01:01:01.376
Tiberias thinks me unpredictable.

01:01:01.486 --> 01:01:04.216
I am unpredictable.

01:01:07.795 --> 01:01:09.355
No. There.

01:01:24.545 --> 01:01:29.645
Come forward.
I am glad to meet Godfrey's son.

01:01:29.755 --> 01:01:32.115
He was one of my greatest teachers.

01:01:32.215 --> 01:01:37.055
He was there when, playing with
the other boys, my arm was cut.

01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:41.995
And it was he, not my father's physicians,
who noticed that I felt no pain.

01:01:43.164 --> 01:01:46.964
He wept when he gave my father the news...

01:01:47.064 --> 01:01:49.034
that I am a leper.

01:01:51.904 --> 01:01:54.534
The Saracens say that this disease...

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:58.374
is God's vengeance against
the vanity of our kingdom.

01:01:58.474 --> 01:02:00.644
As wretched as I am...

01:02:00.744 --> 01:02:04.444
these Arabs believe that the
chastisement that awaits me in hell...

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:08.074
is far more severe and lasting.

01:02:08.184 --> 01:02:11.454
If that's true, I call it unfair.

01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:15.264
Come. Sit.

01:02:18.463 --> 01:02:20.393
Do you play? No.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.833
The whole world is in chess.

01:02:22.933 --> 01:02:26.373
Any move can be the death of you.

01:02:26.473 --> 01:02:29.563
Do anything except
remain where you started...

01:02:29.673 --> 01:02:32.443
and you can't be sure of your end.

01:02:32.543 --> 01:02:35.033
Were you sure of your end once?

01:02:36.983 --> 01:02:39.243
I was. What was it?

01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:44.253
To be buried a hundred
yards from where I was born.

01:02:44.353 --> 01:02:46.383
And now?

01:02:46.493 --> 01:02:49.393
Now I sit in Jerusalem and look upon a king.

01:02:54.002 --> 01:02:57.562
When I was 16 I won a great victory.

01:02:57.672 --> 01:03:00.762
I felt, in that moment,
I would live to be 100.

01:03:02.002 --> 01:03:05.302
Now I know I shall not see 30.

01:03:06.442 --> 01:03:10.212
None of us know our end, really...

01:03:10.312 --> 01:03:12.752
or what hand will guide us there.

01:03:12.852 --> 01:03:16.152
A king may move a man.

01:03:16.252 --> 01:03:18.412
A father may claim a son.

01:03:18.522 --> 01:03:21.892
That man can also move himself.

01:03:21.992 --> 01:03:25.822
And only then does that
man truly begin his own game.

01:03:27.102 --> 01:03:29.291
Remember, how so ever you are played...

01:03:29.401 --> 01:03:33.491
or by whom, your soul
is in your keeping alone...

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:37.271
even though those who presume
to play you be kings or men of power.

01:03:37.371 --> 01:03:41.371
When you stand before God, you cannot say...

01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:44.381
"But I was told by others to do thus"...

01:03:44.481 --> 01:03:48.311
or that virtue was
not convenient at the time.

01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:50.321
This will not suffice.

01:03:50.421 --> 01:03:52.681
Remember that.

01:03:54.391 --> 01:03:56.361
I will.

01:03:58.591 --> 01:04:00.691
You know what this is?

01:04:00.801 --> 01:04:03.630
A fortification. What do you think of it?

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.930
You disapprove.
Well, how would you improve it?

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:13.440
A cross. Or better, a star, like this.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.840
That way no part of the
fortress may be approached...

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:18.640
without being exposed
to fire from another part.

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:22.310
Yes, I like this.
Your walls are more difficult to address.

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:25.880
Very good.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:30.220
You will go to your father's
house at Ibelin, your house now...

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:34.520
and then from there you
will protect the pilgrim road.

01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.690
Safeguard in particular
the Jews and the Muslims.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.559
All are welcome in Jerusalem.

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:45.609
Not only because it's expedient,
but because it is right.

01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:47.699
Protect the helpless.

01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:50.239
And then maybe one day,
when I am helpless...

01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:52.469
you will come and protect me.

01:06:15.557 --> 01:06:17.657
There, my lord.

01:06:17.767 --> 01:06:19.527
Ibelin.

01:07:11.315 --> 01:07:14.875
Quod sumus...

01:07:14.985 --> 01:07:17.645
hoc eritis.

01:07:17.755 --> 01:07:22.125
Such as we are, you will be.

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:58.094
Your father was important.

01:07:58.194 --> 01:08:00.994
His lands were not.

01:08:01.094 --> 01:08:03.364
That will suit me.

01:08:08.234 --> 01:08:11.104
My lord, you have a thousand acres...

01:08:11.203 --> 01:08:14.073
a hundred families.

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:17.233
You have Christians, Jews, Muslims.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.243
You have 50 pairs of oxen.

01:08:19.343 --> 01:08:22.712
This is a poor and dusty place.

01:08:22.813 --> 01:08:26.343
What we do not have is water.

01:09:33.551 --> 01:09:35.850
Right. Stone the walls.

01:10:35.109 --> 01:10:37.169
I'm on my way to Cana.

01:10:41.289 --> 01:10:43.849
Where Jesus changed water to wine.

01:10:45.689 --> 01:10:48.589
But a better trick would be
to change you to a nobleman.

01:10:48.689 --> 01:10:52.749
That should be easy. In France a
few yards of silk can make a nobleman.

01:10:54.869 --> 01:10:56.889
I expect your hospitality.

01:10:56.999 --> 01:10:58.489
It is given.

01:10:58.599 --> 01:11:00.729
Latif.

01:12:47.206 --> 01:12:50.176
But this isn't adultery. It's washing.

01:12:55.315 --> 01:12:57.285
But if it were adultery...

01:12:57.385 --> 01:12:59.355
which it isn't...

01:12:59.455 --> 01:13:02.355
the Commandments are not for people like us.

01:13:02.455 --> 01:13:04.445
They are for the others.

01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:08.225
Did they give you something to eat?

01:13:08.325 --> 01:13:11.195
They said to wait until the master returned.

01:13:14.065 --> 01:13:17.035
My cook will prepare
something while you wash.

01:13:41.764 --> 01:13:43.664
What?

01:13:43.764 --> 01:13:46.564
It seems years since I've seen a woman eat.

01:13:46.664 --> 01:13:48.194
Truly?

01:13:51.974 --> 01:13:54.264
I was watching you today.

01:13:54.374 --> 01:13:57.344
You've been given a
patch of dirt, and it seems...

01:13:58.444 --> 01:14:01.344
you will build a new Jerusalem here.

01:14:01.444 --> 01:14:03.414
It is my land.

01:14:05.553 --> 01:14:08.523
Who would I be if I did
not try to make it better?

01:14:24.073 --> 01:14:27.093
They try to be one...

01:14:27.203 --> 01:14:29.433
one heart...

01:14:29.543 --> 01:14:31.513
one morality.

01:14:31.613 --> 01:14:34.203
Their prophet says, "Submit."

01:14:34.313 --> 01:14:36.443
Jesus says...

01:14:37.483 --> 01:14:39.813
"Decide."

01:14:39.913 --> 01:14:42.712
Did you decide on Guy?

01:14:45.622 --> 01:14:47.882
Guy was chosen by my mother.

01:14:47.992 --> 01:14:50.792
My first husband died
before our son was born.

01:14:50.892 --> 01:14:54.262
I was only 15.

01:14:55.862 --> 01:14:58.232
I've met your son.

01:16:39.769 --> 01:16:41.829
I could stay here forever.

01:16:41.939 --> 01:16:44.599
This house is yours.

01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:47.399
Why do you think I'm here?

01:16:58.549 --> 01:17:01.449
I know that Ibelin is
not on the way to Cana.

01:17:01.559 --> 01:17:03.748
What else do you know, my lord?

01:17:03.858 --> 01:17:06.218
I know that you are a princess...

01:17:07.298 --> 01:17:09.088
and I am no lord.

01:17:09.198 --> 01:17:10.858
You're a knight.

01:17:10.968 --> 01:17:14.028
Neither earned nor proved.

01:17:19.008 --> 01:17:24.138
I'm not here with you because
I'm... I'm bored or wicked.

01:17:25.278 --> 01:17:27.248
I'm here because...

01:17:28.318 --> 01:17:30.218
because in the East...

01:17:30.318 --> 01:17:33.218
between one person and another...

01:17:33.318 --> 01:17:35.448
there is only light.

01:18:48.355 --> 01:18:50.685
Halt!

01:18:53.725 --> 01:18:56.065
This caravan is armed, Reynald.

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:57.965
Good. No sport otherwise.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.825
They've seen us.

01:19:01.935 --> 01:19:03.705
Go after them.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:06.635
A rider is getting away.
It's a broad desert. Nothing'll come of it.

01:19:06.745 --> 01:19:11.045
I prefer not to be hanged
before my wife is queen. Don't worry.

01:19:11.145 --> 01:19:13.175
"Who but Reynald?" they'll say.

01:19:13.285 --> 01:19:16.305
It's always me. They'll believe
it in Jerusalem, I assure you.

01:19:16.415 --> 01:19:20.685
You were at Nazareth, praying.
You're a dangerous man.

01:19:20.795 --> 01:19:24.084
If the war's to be now or
later, I would have it now.

01:19:24.194 --> 01:19:27.894
How long can the leper last?
God wills it. God wills it!

01:19:27.994 --> 01:19:31.024
God wills it! Jerusalem!

01:19:31.134 --> 01:19:34.064
Charge!

01:20:00.533 --> 01:20:03.433
It's you! Ha!

01:20:40.832 --> 01:20:43.272
This is from France.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:44.992
I've never been there.

01:20:45.102 --> 01:20:47.262
This from my brother.

01:20:47.372 --> 01:20:49.842
This to remind us of death.

01:20:49.942 --> 01:20:52.602
And this...

01:20:54.252 --> 01:20:56.612
I bought the day I saw you.

01:20:58.382 --> 01:21:00.412
You lie.

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:33.541
Guy de Lusignan and Reynald
de Chatillon, with the Templars...

01:21:33.651 --> 01:21:35.621
have attacked a Saracen caravan.

01:21:35.721 --> 01:21:38.661
Liar!

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:40.661
Silence!

01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:42.891
It was no caravan.

01:21:42.991 --> 01:21:46.520
It was an army headed for Bethlehem
to desecrate the birthplace of our Lord!

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:50.800
Reynald, with the Templars,
have broken the king's pledge of peace.

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.370
Saladin will come into this kingdom...

01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:57.910
Tiberias knows more than a Christian
should about Saladin's intentions.

01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:07.080
That I would rather live
with men than kill them...

01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:10.020
is certainly why you are alive.

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:13.420
That sort of Christianity
has its uses, I suppose.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:17.190
We must not go to war with Saladin!

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:21.029
We do not want it, and we
may not win it. Blasphemy!

01:22:21.129 --> 01:22:23.099
Blasphemy!

01:22:25.469 --> 01:22:28.909
An army of Jesus Christ, which
bears his holy cross, cannot be beaten.

01:22:29.009 --> 01:22:32.409
Does the count of Tiberias
suggest that it could be?

01:22:32.509 --> 01:22:35.499
There must be war. God wills it!

01:22:35.609 --> 01:22:38.949
God wills it! God wills it!

01:22:39.049 --> 01:22:41.749
God wills it!

01:22:41.849 --> 01:22:43.549
God wills it!

01:22:51.859 --> 01:22:54.089
Silence!

01:23:03.268 --> 01:23:07.138
Saladin has crossed the
Jordan with 200,000 men.

01:23:08.648 --> 01:23:11.808
He will make first for Kerak
and Reynald de Chatillon.

01:23:11.918 --> 01:23:13.818
My lord...

01:23:21.058 --> 01:23:24.488
We must meet him before he reaches Kerak.

01:23:24.598 --> 01:23:26.558
I will lead the army.

01:23:26.658 --> 01:23:31.117
My lord, if you travel, you'll die.

01:23:31.237 --> 01:23:34.497
Send word to Balian to
protect the villagers.

01:23:37.267 --> 01:23:39.167
Assemble the army.

01:23:59.457 --> 01:24:01.427
What becomes of us?

01:24:02.897 --> 01:24:04.867
The world will decide.

01:24:06.596 --> 01:24:09.796
The world always decides.

01:24:28.156 --> 01:24:31.286
My lord! The king is marching on Kerak.

01:24:46.205 --> 01:24:49.535
Let's go! Hurry. Straight on!

01:24:55.315 --> 01:24:59.375
Saracen cavalry.
They're coming to close Reynald in.

01:24:59.485 --> 01:25:02.075
These people are not safe outside the walls.

01:25:02.185 --> 01:25:04.815
Saladin will certainly come behind him.

01:25:17.934 --> 01:25:20.404
Go into the fortress now.

01:25:21.604 --> 01:25:25.704
Hyah! Hah!

01:25:33.184 --> 01:25:35.414
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:25:35.524 --> 01:25:37.584
Hyah! Hyah!

01:25:52.174 --> 01:25:54.363
Visitors!

01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:08.913
My lord Balian! My lord Balian!

01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:13.753
My lord Reynald prays you
bring your force into Kerak.

01:26:13.853 --> 01:26:17.383
Thank you, but no.
If we do, these people will die.

01:26:17.493 --> 01:26:21.293
We'll hold the Saracen
cavalry until the king arrives.

01:26:21.403 --> 01:26:24.763
So be it. Hyah!

01:26:27.073 --> 01:26:29.432
We cannot attack that and live.

01:26:32.712 --> 01:26:36.402
My lady. What do you look at?

01:26:36.512 --> 01:26:38.482
A knight.

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:42.512
His men.

01:26:49.792 --> 01:26:53.092
Are you with me?

01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:51.880
Forward!

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:02.330
Divide!

01:30:05.886 --> 01:30:08.856
Your quality will be
known among your enemies...

01:30:08.956 --> 01:30:11.226
before ever you meet them, my friend.

01:30:14.436 --> 01:30:17.196
You were not that man's servant.

01:30:17.306 --> 01:30:20.596
No. He was my servant.

01:30:30.416 --> 01:30:33.976
What becomes of us? As you deserve.

01:30:34.086 --> 01:30:37.545
You reap what you sow.

01:30:37.655 --> 01:30:40.525
You have heard of this, no?

01:30:41.825 --> 01:30:44.025
Get up.

01:30:56.875 --> 01:30:58.845
You may go into Kerak...

01:30:58.945 --> 01:31:01.505
but you will die there.

01:31:01.615 --> 01:31:04.235
My master is here.

01:31:24.234 --> 01:31:27.864
Tell my lord Saladin
that Jerusalem has come.

01:32:29.032 --> 01:32:30.932
Saladin.

01:32:53.452 --> 01:32:57.981
I pray you'll pull back your
cavalry and leave this matter to me.

01:32:58.091 --> 01:33:02.891
I pray you'll retire unharmed to Damascus.

01:33:02.991 --> 01:33:05.621
Reynald of Chatillon will be punished.

01:33:05.731 --> 01:33:07.631
I swear it.

01:33:07.731 --> 01:33:10.701
Withdraw, or we will all die here.

01:33:22.851 --> 01:33:25.081
Do we have terms?

01:33:29.221 --> 01:33:31.191
We have terms.

01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:42.090
I will send you my physicians.

01:33:43.670 --> 01:33:47.700
Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.449
I am Reynald of Chatillon!

01:34:50.868 --> 01:34:53.238
On your knees.

01:34:55.508 --> 01:34:57.698
Lower.

01:35:00.278 --> 01:35:03.838
I... am Jerusalem.

01:35:06.048 --> 01:35:09.148
And you, Reynald...

01:35:09.248 --> 01:35:12.448
will give me the kiss of peace.

01:35:31.207 --> 01:35:33.197
Guard.

01:35:40.887 --> 01:35:44.117
What are you looking at? A dead man.

01:35:44.217 --> 01:35:47.207
Reynald de Chatillon, you are arrested...

01:35:47.327 --> 01:35:49.347
and condemned.

01:35:52.227 --> 01:35:54.956
Come.

01:36:06.076 --> 01:36:09.306
If you continue like this...

01:36:09.406 --> 01:36:11.746
I shall have to find a use for you.

01:36:11.846 --> 01:36:13.816
If God can spare you, that is.

01:36:13.916 --> 01:36:16.046
God does not know me.

01:36:16.146 --> 01:36:17.816
Yes, but I do.

01:36:41.275 --> 01:36:43.905
I need you in Jerusalem.

01:37:27.434 --> 01:37:30.334
Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam.

01:37:37.474 --> 01:37:40.643
Why did we retire?

01:37:40.743 --> 01:37:43.733
Why?

01:37:43.853 --> 01:37:47.843
God did not favor him. God, alone,
determines the results of battles.

01:37:47.953 --> 01:37:51.283
The results of battles
are determined by God...

01:37:51.393 --> 01:37:54.693
but also by preparation, numbers...

01:37:54.793 --> 01:37:58.563
the absence of disease
and the availability of water.

01:37:58.663 --> 01:38:02.863
One cannot maintain a
siege with the enemy behind.

01:38:02.963 --> 01:38:07.533
How many battles did God win
for the Muslims before I came?

01:38:07.643 --> 01:38:12.043
That is, before God
determined that I should come.

01:38:13.683 --> 01:38:15.582
Few enough.

01:38:17.082 --> 01:38:19.552
That's because we were sinful.

01:38:21.352 --> 01:38:24.182
It is because you were unprepared.

01:38:24.292 --> 01:38:27.522
If you think that way,
you shall not be king for long.

01:38:33.962 --> 01:38:37.732
When I am not king, I quake for Islam.

01:38:39.172 --> 01:38:41.162
Thank you for your visit.

01:38:45.242 --> 01:38:47.902
Thank you for your visit.

01:38:53.081 --> 01:38:55.311
You promised.

01:38:55.421 --> 01:38:58.511
You promised to return Jerusalem.

01:39:00.021 --> 01:39:01.921
Don't forget.

01:39:17.611 --> 01:39:21.041
If I do not deliver war, I have no peace.

01:39:21.141 --> 01:39:24.041
The king of Jerusalem will die soon.

01:39:24.151 --> 01:39:28.580
When he is dead, the boy will become
king of a kingdom he cannot control.

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:33.450
The Christians will make the war you need.

01:40:31.949 --> 01:40:35.469
I am Reynald de Chatillon!

01:40:37.748 --> 01:40:43.048
I am Reynald de Chatillon!

01:40:43.158 --> 01:40:46.818
Reynald de Chatillon!

01:40:51.698 --> 01:40:54.568
Reynald de Chatillon!

01:40:54.668 --> 01:40:58.998
The things that we have left undone...

01:40:59.108 --> 01:41:02.798
plague us as death comes.

01:41:02.908 --> 01:41:05.238
That is why to the dying...

01:41:05.348 --> 01:41:07.938
There is no comfort but the Lord.

01:41:08.048 --> 01:41:11.038
Spare me your sermon.

01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:14.947
Go and prepare your people
for the coronation of my nephew.

01:41:17.357 --> 01:41:19.987
Your confession, my lord.

01:41:20.087 --> 01:41:23.187
I shall confess to God when I see him...

01:41:26.127 --> 01:41:28.097
not to you.

01:41:29.137 --> 01:41:31.697
Now leave me.

01:42:17.446 --> 01:42:21.286
You sometimes dream you are my wife.

01:42:21.386 --> 01:42:24.085
Let's pretend you are.

01:43:01.694 --> 01:43:03.654
I must go.

01:43:08.064 --> 01:43:11.504
We can't meet in the city.

01:43:11.604 --> 01:43:13.364
Then we will leave it.

01:43:13.464 --> 01:43:17.464
And live how? Live where?

01:43:17.574 --> 01:43:19.634
Balian...

01:43:19.744 --> 01:43:23.004
my brother's dying.

01:43:23.114 --> 01:43:28.514
My son will be king and I
his regent. I must rule for him.

01:43:28.614 --> 01:43:32.344
And not just in Jerusalem, but Acre...

01:43:32.454 --> 01:43:34.823
Ashkelon, Beirut.

01:43:37.463 --> 01:43:39.423
And Guy?

01:44:07.653 --> 01:44:11.452
Always surround your knights
with your foot soldiers.

01:44:14.592 --> 01:44:16.652
These rooms are not yours.

01:44:19.902 --> 01:44:24.062
One day I will be the husband
I was commissioned to be.

01:44:24.172 --> 01:44:27.232
And perhaps not, my dear.

01:44:27.342 --> 01:44:31.672
Your lover has a hundred
knights and the love of the king.

01:44:31.782 --> 01:44:35.232
I, the largest force in the kingdom...

01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:38.012
and the support of the Templars.

01:44:38.122 --> 01:44:41.742
I can do without the king's affection.

01:44:41.852 --> 01:44:43.882
But as for your love...

01:44:53.431 --> 01:44:55.761
Then we must come to an understanding.

01:44:55.871 --> 01:45:01.431
You need my knights or
his rule will be bloody and brief.

01:45:15.621 --> 01:45:17.711
So, my friend...

01:45:17.821 --> 01:45:21.420
the time has come to conclude my affairs.

01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:23.490
If I leave the army with Guy...

01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:27.460
he will take power through my
sister and make war on the Muslims.

01:45:27.570 --> 01:45:32.260
We have decided that you shall
take command of the army of Jerusalem.

01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:36.270
Will you defend my nephew when he's king?

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.840
Whatever you ask. I will serve.

01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:45.040
No, hear it all before you answer.

01:45:45.150 --> 01:45:50.250
Would you marry my sister, Sibylla,
were she free of Guy de Lusignan?

01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:53.790
And Guy?

01:45:53.890 --> 01:45:57.049
He will be executed...

01:45:57.159 --> 01:46:01.259
along with his knights who
do not swear your allegiance.

01:46:04.339 --> 01:46:06.529
I cannot be the cause of that.

01:46:06.639 --> 01:46:11.369
"Whatever you ask. I will serve."

01:46:14.279 --> 01:46:17.839
"A king may move a man," you said...

01:46:19.449 --> 01:46:23.049
"but the soul belongs to the man."

01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:25.819
Yes, I did.

01:46:25.919 --> 01:46:28.119
You have my love...

01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:31.018
and my answer.

01:46:31.128 --> 01:46:34.148
Oh. So be it.

01:46:35.228 --> 01:46:38.328
Why do you protect Guy, hmm?

01:46:38.438 --> 01:46:41.628
He's a man who insults you, who hates you...

01:46:41.738 --> 01:46:44.368
who'd kill you himself if he had the chance.

01:46:44.478 --> 01:46:47.208
Fulfill the salvation of this kingdom.

01:46:47.308 --> 01:46:49.248
Would it be so hard...

01:46:49.348 --> 01:46:52.208
to marry Sibylla?

01:46:52.318 --> 01:46:57.048
Jerusalem has no need of a perfect knight.

01:46:57.148 --> 01:47:01.058
No. It is a kingdom of conscience...

01:47:01.158 --> 01:47:03.058
or nothing.

01:47:22.207 --> 01:47:24.107
Sibylla.

01:47:36.687 --> 01:47:39.457
Who are you to refuse a king?

01:47:39.557 --> 01:47:43.286
I will have power, without Guy or with him.

01:47:43.396 --> 01:47:47.696
Guy is indebted to your say-so
and my brother's, but it's mine.

01:47:49.906 --> 01:47:53.536
Do you have any idea of
Jerusalem except that it is yours?

01:47:53.636 --> 01:47:56.906
You will never hold it in
peace as your brother did.

01:47:57.006 --> 01:47:58.806
It will be war.

01:47:58.916 --> 01:48:02.406
My grandfather took Jerusalem in blood.

01:48:02.516 --> 01:48:06.416
I'll keep it the same way or any way I can.

01:48:06.516 --> 01:48:08.386
I am what I am.

01:48:08.486 --> 01:48:10.586
I offer you that...

01:48:11.656 --> 01:48:13.756
and the world.

01:48:20.065 --> 01:48:22.325
You say no.

01:48:24.105 --> 01:48:26.575
Do you think I'm like Guy?

01:48:26.675 --> 01:48:30.165
That I would sell my soul?

01:48:36.445 --> 01:48:38.415
There'll be a day...

01:48:38.515 --> 01:48:41.485
when you will wish
you had done a little evil...

01:48:41.585 --> 01:48:44.215
to do a greater good.

01:48:50.395 --> 01:48:53.364
Reynald.

01:49:00.474 --> 01:49:02.444
My lord.

01:49:38.743 --> 01:49:40.643
Mmm.

01:49:42.643 --> 01:49:48.103
Do you really think the king wants you
head of the army once he's gone? Hmm?

01:49:49.183 --> 01:49:51.853
Think your wife does?

01:49:57.863 --> 01:50:01.993
I have a problem. Ah, yes. Balian.

01:50:02.103 --> 01:50:04.562
I saw him at Kerak.

01:50:05.972 --> 01:50:08.662
Celebrated.

01:50:08.772 --> 01:50:12.502
You must beware a popular man.

01:50:12.612 --> 01:50:15.202
Kill him.

01:50:21.722 --> 01:50:23.842
What's that? England.

01:50:23.952 --> 01:50:27.082
The king? Richard. And his father was Henry.

01:50:27.192 --> 01:50:30.252
Good. And that? France.

01:50:30.362 --> 01:50:32.122
Will I ever see France?

01:50:32.232 --> 01:50:35.462
Maybe one day. But you must be king here.

01:50:36.632 --> 01:50:40.031
How many islands can you see here?

01:50:40.131 --> 01:50:43.231
One, two... The king will see you.

01:50:43.341 --> 01:50:49.041
No, I can't. I can't bear
to look at him. Use this.

01:50:49.141 --> 01:50:51.911
It doesn't mean I don't love him.

01:50:52.011 --> 01:50:54.611
Go, madam.

01:52:31.408 --> 01:52:34.638
Oh. Hello.

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:40.688
I was dreaming...

01:52:40.788 --> 01:52:44.478
I was back in that summer...

01:52:44.588 --> 01:52:46.818
when I defeated Saladin.

01:52:46.928 --> 01:52:49.898
Do you remember it?

01:52:49.998 --> 01:52:53.058
I was only 16.

01:52:53.168 --> 01:52:55.658
You were a beautiful boy.

01:52:55.768 --> 01:52:58.998
Yes. You have always been beautiful.

01:53:00.107 --> 01:53:02.077
In every way.

01:53:05.777 --> 01:53:10.677
My beautiful sister. I've missed you.

01:53:10.777 --> 01:53:12.677
So beautiful.

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:17.507
I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain.

01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:23.697
Remember me as I was.

01:53:25.597 --> 01:53:27.497
I will.

01:54:18.615 --> 01:54:20.675
Sibylla.

01:54:34.895 --> 01:54:37.335
If my son has your knights...

01:54:40.135 --> 01:54:43.005
you have your wife.

01:56:05.652 --> 01:56:08.142
Behold your rightful king and heir...

01:56:08.252 --> 01:56:11.242
to the throne of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

01:56:11.362 --> 01:56:14.952
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:56:15.062 --> 01:56:17.862
Long live the king in prosperity.

01:56:17.962 --> 01:56:22.022
Long live the king. Long live the king.

01:56:22.132 --> 01:56:24.072
Long live the king.

01:56:38.851 --> 01:56:42.381
One may stare into the
light until one becomes the light.

01:56:42.491 --> 01:56:44.651
I've done it many times.

01:56:51.701 --> 01:56:53.631
There's your religion.

01:56:53.731 --> 01:56:57.001
One spark, a creosote bush.

01:56:59.701 --> 01:57:04.301
There's your Moses. I did not hear it speak.

01:57:04.411 --> 01:57:07.171
That does not mean that there is no God.

01:57:07.281 --> 01:57:10.470
Do you love her?

01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:13.850
Yes. The heart will mend.

01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:17.250
Your duty is to the people of the city.

01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:19.750
I go to pray. For what?

01:57:22.930 --> 01:57:25.920
For the strength to endure what is to come.

01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:27.930
And what is to come?

01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:32.660
The reckoning is to come for
what was done 100 years before.

01:57:32.770 --> 01:57:35.700
The Muslims will never forget.

01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:41.300
Nor should they.

01:58:12.509 --> 01:58:15.479
My lady, your letter to Saladin.

01:58:15.579 --> 01:58:20.448
Peace to be sustained, borders
respected, trade allowed to continue.

01:58:20.548 --> 01:58:24.208
Is this wise to show your intentions?

01:58:24.318 --> 01:58:27.258
Better, surely, to let him wonder.

01:58:27.358 --> 01:58:29.378
We keep my brother's peace.

01:58:29.488 --> 01:58:31.588
Sign it.

01:58:42.668 --> 01:58:45.158
Take the seal.

01:58:46.438 --> 01:58:49.498
Be careful. Be careful.

01:59:00.987 --> 01:59:03.957
Put it back, my darling.

01:59:16.967 --> 01:59:20.027
Hey!

01:59:49.766 --> 01:59:52.366
There is a rumor.

01:59:52.476 --> 01:59:54.466
We must condemn it immediately.

01:59:55.776 --> 01:59:59.976
Call it treason,
and kill those who whisper it.

02:00:00.076 --> 02:00:04.415
The rumor will die if
we show the boy as active.

02:00:06.355 --> 02:00:09.755
How long before he wears a mask?

02:00:12.325 --> 02:00:15.295
Will you have one made for him?

02:00:15.395 --> 02:00:20.025
How did my boy deserve it?

02:00:24.065 --> 02:00:26.505
Jerusalem is dead, Tiberias.

02:00:29.205 --> 02:00:32.505
No kingdom is worth my son alive in hell.

02:00:34.475 --> 02:00:37.885
I will go to hell instead.

02:01:00.274 --> 02:01:03.724
Do you remember the story of Llewellyn? No.

02:01:03.844 --> 02:01:08.004
Well, do you remember why? No.

02:01:08.114 --> 02:01:10.374
He was so lonely...

02:01:10.484 --> 02:01:14.214
and he called all the gods.

02:01:14.314 --> 02:01:18.753
Why? Because he was desperate.
It was a proof of love.

02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:05.020
Is this why you came to the Holy Land?

02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:07.360
Come on!

02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:32.650
Leave us.

02:03:37.389 --> 02:03:40.849
The boy's in heaven? Yes.

02:03:40.959 --> 02:03:44.789
His mother has more backbone than I do.

02:03:44.899 --> 02:03:48.159
She's in the crypt and will not come out.

02:03:51.239 --> 02:03:55.969
Have the Templars killed Balian? Yes.

02:03:56.079 --> 02:03:58.599
Reynald...

02:03:58.709 --> 02:04:00.679
give me a war.

02:04:02.279 --> 02:04:04.909
That is what I do.

02:04:06.649 --> 02:04:09.139
Behold your rightful queen and heir...

02:04:09.259 --> 02:04:11.489
to the throne of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:14.218
Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:04:14.328 --> 02:04:17.388
I, Sibylla, by the grace
of the Holy Spirit...

02:04:17.498 --> 02:04:21.088
choose as king Guy de Lusignan...

02:04:21.198 --> 02:04:24.098
the man who's been my husband.

02:04:24.198 --> 02:04:27.368
With the help of God,
he will rule his people well.

02:04:30.808 --> 02:04:34.178
Long live the king in prosperity.

02:04:34.278 --> 02:04:38.308
Long live the king. Long live the king.

02:04:38.418 --> 02:04:40.278
Long live the king.

02:05:02.907 --> 02:05:06.037
I am what I am.

02:05:06.147 --> 02:05:08.047
Someone has to be.

02:05:32.836 --> 02:05:34.806
Saladin's sister.

02:05:36.276 --> 02:05:38.176
I know.

02:05:54.256 --> 02:05:56.246
Saladin achki.

02:05:57.995 --> 02:05:59.985
I know.

02:06:22.685 --> 02:06:26.315
Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam.

02:06:26.425 --> 02:06:28.325
Speak.

02:06:33.624 --> 02:06:36.724
The sultan demands the
return of his sister's body...

02:06:36.834 --> 02:06:38.824
the heads of those responsible...

02:06:38.934 --> 02:06:41.234
and the surrender of Jerusalem.

02:06:45.604 --> 02:06:47.504
Does he?

02:06:49.114 --> 02:06:51.574
What answer do you return to Saladin?

02:07:02.954 --> 02:07:05.724
This.

02:07:20.143 --> 02:07:23.373
Take the head to Damascus.

02:07:31.313 --> 02:07:33.543
I am Jerusalem.

02:07:37.823 --> 02:07:42.923
Assemble the army! Yea!

02:08:03.682 --> 02:08:05.942
Now this assembly of barons...

02:08:06.052 --> 02:08:09.312
and all Jerusalem is complete.

02:08:09.422 --> 02:08:13.982
There are those among you who
may disagree with our succession...

02:08:14.092 --> 02:08:16.852
but it is war.

02:08:16.962 --> 02:08:19.192
Aye!

02:08:19.302 --> 02:08:22.061
And I am...

02:08:22.171 --> 02:08:24.261
the king.

02:08:25.401 --> 02:08:28.731
We march at once. What say this council?

02:08:28.841 --> 02:08:32.471
Aye! No.

02:08:32.581 --> 02:08:37.671
If you must have war, this army
cannot move away from water.

02:08:39.081 --> 02:08:42.351
You have a chance to hold the city...

02:08:42.451 --> 02:08:45.221
but if you move out against Saladin...

02:08:45.321 --> 02:08:48.781
this army will be destroyed
and the city left defenseless.

02:08:48.891 --> 02:08:52.591
When I wish a blacksmith
to advise me in war...

02:08:52.701 --> 02:08:55.160
I will tell him.

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:57.960
Saladin wants you to come out.

02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:03.330
He is waiting for you to make that mistake.

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.630
He knows his man.

02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:08.570
We should meet the enemies of God. Aye!

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:10.580
And so we shall.

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:14.140
Then you do so without my knights.

02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:19.690
Then I will have the glory, Tiberias.
You had yours years and years ago.

02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:22.450
It's time for mine.

02:09:27.930 --> 02:09:30.729
Forward!

02:09:33.099 --> 02:09:35.069
Forward!

02:09:50.449 --> 02:09:52.419
Tiberias.

02:09:53.859 --> 02:09:58.489
When Saladin has finished
with Guy, he will come.

02:09:58.589 --> 02:10:00.559
We must look to the defenses.

02:10:00.659 --> 02:10:04.029
The boy's dead.

02:10:07.938 --> 02:10:09.928
Guy. No.

02:10:10.038 --> 02:10:12.838
The boy was leprous like his uncle.

02:10:12.938 --> 02:10:15.598
She gave him peace.

02:10:15.708 --> 02:10:17.678
She let him go...

02:10:20.018 --> 02:10:23.848
and Jerusalem along with him.

02:10:27.658 --> 02:10:30.018
Keep to your lines!

02:10:30.128 --> 02:10:32.288
You go with the army?

02:10:32.398 --> 02:10:34.358
My order is with the army.

02:10:34.458 --> 02:10:37.228
You go to certain death.

02:10:37.328 --> 02:10:39.558
All death is certain.

02:10:39.668 --> 02:10:43.297
I shall tell your father
what I've seen you become.

02:11:24.906 --> 02:11:27.176
When Saladin comes...

02:11:28.276 --> 02:11:31.246
we're not defensible.

02:11:33.716 --> 02:11:36.846
Save the people from what I have done.

02:11:36.956 --> 02:11:38.856
I will.

02:12:41.754 --> 02:12:43.274
God wills it.

02:13:12.813 --> 02:13:15.413
Can you sense it?

02:13:15.513 --> 02:13:18.383
There has been no messenger.

02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:42.301
I drink water for what it is.

02:14:46.311 --> 02:14:48.331
I did not give the cup to you.

02:14:48.441 --> 02:14:51.210
No, my lord.

02:16:01.048 --> 02:16:04.018
A king does not kill a king.

02:16:04.118 --> 02:16:06.578
Were you not close enough to a great king...

02:16:06.688 --> 02:16:09.278
to learn by his example?

02:16:46.656 --> 02:16:49.787
I've given Jerusalem my whole life.

02:16:49.897 --> 02:16:51.797
Everything.

02:16:54.326 --> 02:16:59.427
First I thought we... were fighting for God.

02:16:59.537 --> 02:17:04.337
Then I realized we were
fighting for wealth and land.

02:17:04.437 --> 02:17:06.406
I was ashamed.

02:17:14.646 --> 02:17:16.846
Tiberias.

02:17:16.956 --> 02:17:19.786
There is no more Jerusalem.

02:17:21.085 --> 02:17:24.995
I shall go to Cyprus. Will you come with me?

02:17:25.096 --> 02:17:26.656
No.

02:17:28.126 --> 02:17:30.596
You are your father's son.

02:17:32.236 --> 02:17:36.796
Saladin must move his
army from water to water.

02:17:36.906 --> 02:17:40.846
That gives you four days, maybe five.

02:17:42.276 --> 02:17:44.806
God be with you.

02:17:44.915 --> 02:17:48.504
He's no longer with me.

02:18:40.704 --> 02:18:43.864
Mark 400. Four hundred!

02:18:43.974 --> 02:18:47.064
Four hundred!

02:19:01.653 --> 02:19:03.553
They're here.

02:19:03.653 --> 02:19:05.352
It is only one man.

02:19:09.022 --> 02:19:11.723
No. They're here.

02:19:31.582 --> 02:19:35.242
This is the only section of
the wall that they can attack...

02:19:35.352 --> 02:19:38.222
once they begin to bombard the walls.

02:19:38.322 --> 02:19:41.552
They will stop only to avoid hitting
their own siege towers as they come in.

02:19:41.662 --> 02:19:43.992
We take the bombardment.

02:19:44.092 --> 02:19:46.652
When they cease firing, we fire.

02:19:50.402 --> 02:19:53.202
We must leave the city.

02:19:53.302 --> 02:19:55.272
How exactly, my lord bishop?

02:19:55.372 --> 02:19:57.862
The fastest horses from a lesser gate.

02:19:58.912 --> 02:20:00.812
And the people?

02:20:00.912 --> 02:20:05.142
It is unfortunate about
the people, but it is God's will.

02:20:12.551 --> 02:20:14.491
Silence!

02:20:17.761 --> 02:20:19.661
Silence!

02:20:23.831 --> 02:20:25.801
It has fallen to us...

02:20:25.901 --> 02:20:27.961
to defend Jerusalem...

02:20:28.071 --> 02:20:32.301
and we have made our
preparations as well as they can be made.

02:20:33.941 --> 02:20:37.341
None of us took this city from Muslims.

02:20:38.811 --> 02:20:42.680
No Muslim, of the great
army now coming against us...

02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:47.520
was born when this city was lost.

02:20:47.620 --> 02:20:52.150
We fight over an offense we did not give...

02:20:52.260 --> 02:20:55.490
against those who were
not alive to be offended.

02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:00.270
What is Jerusalem?

02:21:00.370 --> 02:21:03.360
Your holy places lie
over the Jewish temple...

02:21:03.470 --> 02:21:06.130
that the Romans pulled down.

02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:08.840
The Muslim places of worship lie over yours.

02:21:11.350 --> 02:21:13.810
Which is more holy?

02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:19.909
The wall? The mosque?

02:21:20.019 --> 02:21:22.149
The sepulcher?

02:21:22.259 --> 02:21:24.379
Who has claim?

02:21:24.559 --> 02:21:26.859
No one has claim.

02:21:28.199 --> 02:21:30.169
All have claim!

02:21:30.269 --> 02:21:32.429
That is blasphemy. Be quiet.

02:21:32.539 --> 02:21:34.509
We defend this city...

02:21:34.609 --> 02:21:37.269
not to protect these stones...

02:21:37.379 --> 02:21:40.499
but the people living within these walls.

02:22:03.468 --> 02:22:05.938
My lord. My lord, my lord.

02:22:06.038 --> 02:22:11.028
How are we to defend
Jerusalem without knights?

02:22:11.138 --> 02:22:13.798
We have no knights! Truly?

02:22:23.558 --> 02:22:27.218
What is your condition?
I'm servant to the patriarch.

02:22:27.328 --> 02:22:30.017
He's, uh, one of my servants.

02:22:30.127 --> 02:22:33.687
Is he? You were born a servant?

02:22:33.797 --> 02:22:36.227
Kneel.

02:22:40.137 --> 02:22:42.967
Every man at arms...

02:22:43.067 --> 02:22:45.067
or capable of bearing them...

02:22:45.177 --> 02:22:47.077
kneel!

02:22:51.077 --> 02:22:53.307
On your knees!

02:22:59.957 --> 02:23:04.186
Be without fear in the face of your enemies.

02:23:04.296 --> 02:23:07.926
Be brave and upright that God may love thee.

02:23:09.466 --> 02:23:13.426
Speak the truth even
if it leads to your death.

02:23:16.206 --> 02:23:18.106
Safeguard the helpless.

02:23:18.206 --> 02:23:20.106
That is your oath.

02:23:25.616 --> 02:23:27.776
And that is so you remember it.

02:23:27.886 --> 02:23:30.946
Rise a knight.

02:23:31.056 --> 02:23:32.716
Rise a knight!

02:23:39.965 --> 02:23:43.555
Master Gravedigger. It is you.

02:23:43.665 --> 02:23:46.425
Not what I was. Nor are you.

02:23:46.535 --> 02:23:48.625
Rise a knight.

02:23:51.175 --> 02:23:55.335
Who do you think you are?
Will you alter the world?

02:23:55.445 --> 02:23:59.275
Does making a man a knight
make him a better fighter?

02:24:06.185 --> 02:24:08.085
Yes.

02:24:43.254 --> 02:24:45.224
Almaric...

02:24:47.924 --> 02:24:52.553
if you survive, Ibelin is yours.

02:24:54.833 --> 02:24:57.063
You are master of Ibelin.

02:25:02.643 --> 02:25:04.613
I confirm it.

02:25:06.143 --> 02:25:10.173
Rise a knight and baron of Ibelin.

02:25:12.113 --> 02:25:16.283
But it is a poor and dusty place.

02:25:28.632 --> 02:25:32.832
My lord? No.

02:25:41.042 --> 02:25:43.532
When will it begin?

02:25:47.822 --> 02:25:50.252
Soon.

02:26:20.331 --> 02:26:22.321
Get them to the walls!

02:26:23.901 --> 02:26:27.361
Water! Bring water!

02:26:28.841 --> 02:26:31.471
Get to the walls.

02:26:33.581 --> 02:26:35.981
Push!

02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:41.320
Run! Push!

02:26:57.900 --> 02:26:59.930
Why do they not fire back?

02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:03.500
They wait.

02:28:28.957 --> 02:28:33.727
That was only the first day.
There may be a hundred more.

02:28:33.827 --> 02:28:37.287
Saladin will show no mercy.

02:28:40.307 --> 02:28:42.267
We must hold out...

02:28:42.367 --> 02:28:44.927
force him to offer terms.

02:28:45.037 --> 02:28:46.137
What terms?

02:28:46.147 --> 02:28:50.667
We fight for the people...
their safety and freedom.

02:29:45.065 --> 02:29:46.995
Mercy. No.

02:29:47.105 --> 02:29:49.035
I cannot.

02:30:37.854 --> 02:30:41.684
Four hundred! Four hundred!

02:30:41.784 --> 02:30:44.183
Four hundred! Fire! Fire!

02:31:13.653 --> 02:31:15.643
Three hundred! Three hundred!

02:31:15.753 --> 02:31:17.783
Fire! Fire!

02:31:17.893 --> 02:31:20.882
Fire!

02:31:28.332 --> 02:31:30.922
One-fifty! One-fifty!

02:31:31.972 --> 02:31:34.592
Line up! Fire!

02:32:06.571 --> 02:32:10.601
Hold your fire! Hold!

02:32:17.651 --> 02:32:20.111
Fire!

02:32:20.211 --> 02:32:22.151
Fire!

02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:01.650
Oil! Now!

02:33:04.330 --> 02:33:06.189
Fire!

02:33:25.509 --> 02:33:27.979
Who defends?

02:33:28.079 --> 02:33:32.209
Balian of Ibelin,
the son of Godfrey. Godfrey.

02:33:32.319 --> 02:33:35.759
Godfrey nearly killed me in the Lebanon.

02:33:35.859 --> 02:33:39.189
Truly, I did not know he had a son.

02:33:39.289 --> 02:33:41.118
It was his son at Kerak.

02:33:45.128 --> 02:33:48.568
The one you let live. Yes.

02:33:48.668 --> 02:33:51.138
Perhaps you should not have.

02:33:51.238 --> 02:33:55.038
Perhaps I should have
had a different teacher.

02:36:13.844 --> 02:36:15.744
Fire!

02:36:19.984 --> 02:36:22.504
Fire!

02:36:22.614 --> 02:36:24.714
Fire!

02:36:25.954 --> 02:36:27.944
Fire!

02:36:28.054 --> 02:36:30.254
Now!

02:37:29.212 --> 02:37:33.652
You are not a sister. We are what we do.

02:37:35.452 --> 02:37:38.682
Then I'm a man who's traveled
a long way to die for nothing.

02:37:40.062 --> 02:37:42.152
What would you say to that?

02:37:47.232 --> 02:37:49.431
I- I would say that I'm sorry.

02:37:49.531 --> 02:37:51.521
And I'm sorry for you...

02:37:53.941 --> 02:37:55.961
Queen of Jerusalem.

02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:48.460
When a body is burnt...

02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:51.890
it cannot be resurrected until Judgment Day.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.120
If we do not burn these bodies...

02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:58.400
we will all be dead
of disease in three days.

02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:01.299
God will understand, my lord.

02:39:01.409 --> 02:39:03.369
And if he doesn't...

02:39:03.469 --> 02:39:08.739
then he is not God, and we need not worry.

02:39:21.989 --> 02:39:24.429
Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam.

02:39:24.529 --> 02:39:28.289
The wall, where the Christopher
Gate used to be, has been weakened.

02:39:28.399 --> 02:39:31.099
Usually when a gate is blocked in,
it is weaker than the wall around it.

02:39:31.199 --> 02:39:35.658
Or stronger. It is weaker.
Rashid has seen it.

02:39:35.768 --> 02:39:39.638
This will be our door into Jerusalem.

02:39:48.688 --> 02:39:52.748
This is where we will make our stand.

02:39:52.858 --> 02:39:54.648
We must prepare.

02:39:57.798 --> 02:40:00.628
Brothers! Brothers!

02:40:00.728 --> 02:40:02.928
God has sent you this day!

02:40:03.028 --> 02:40:05.498
You will take no prisoners!

02:40:05.598 --> 02:40:08.798
As they did, so shall it be done!

02:40:08.908 --> 02:40:12.167
Allah hu akbar! Allah hu akbar!

02:40:49.746 --> 02:40:52.606
When this wall comes down...

02:40:54.586 --> 02:40:56.986
there will be no quarter.

02:40:57.086 --> 02:41:00.546
If you throw down your arms...

02:41:00.656 --> 02:41:02.586
your families will die.

02:41:06.756 --> 02:41:09.596
We can break this army here.

02:41:13.496 --> 02:41:17.126
So I say let them come!

02:41:17.236 --> 02:41:20.036
Let them come!

02:41:20.136 --> 02:41:23.265
Come on! Come on!

02:41:23.375 --> 02:41:25.505
Come on!

02:45:01.719 --> 02:45:06.819
Remember me in France, Master Gravedigger.

02:45:06.929 --> 02:45:08.589
My lord!

02:45:40.958 --> 02:45:43.258
They will ask for terms.

02:45:43.358 --> 02:45:46.488
They must ask for terms.

02:45:46.598 --> 02:45:50.698
Convert to Islam. Repent later.

02:45:52.908 --> 02:45:56.498
You've taught me a lot
about religion, Your Eminence.

02:46:18.727 --> 02:46:21.527
Will you yield the city?

02:46:25.407 --> 02:46:29.067
Before I lose it,
I will burn it to the ground.

02:46:29.177 --> 02:46:31.467
Your holy places, ours.

02:46:31.577 --> 02:46:34.737
Every last thing in
Jerusalem that drives men mad.

02:46:36.577 --> 02:46:40.106
I wonder if it would
not be better if you did.

02:46:40.216 --> 02:46:43.186
You will destroy it? Every stone.

02:46:43.286 --> 02:46:47.346
And every Christian knight
you kill will take 10 Saracens with him.

02:46:47.456 --> 02:46:49.856
You will destroy your army
here and never raise another.

02:46:49.956 --> 02:46:54.526
I swear to God that to take
this city will be the end of you.

02:46:59.106 --> 02:47:01.726
Your city is full of women and children.

02:47:01.836 --> 02:47:04.706
If my army will die...

02:47:04.806 --> 02:47:06.776
so will your city.

02:47:11.546 --> 02:47:14.076
You offer terms. I ask none.

02:47:18.455 --> 02:47:22.615
I will give every soul safe
conduct to Christian lands.

02:47:22.725 --> 02:47:24.985
Every soul...

02:47:25.095 --> 02:47:27.965
the women, the children, the old...

02:47:28.065 --> 02:47:32.935
and all your knights and
soldiers, and your queen.

02:47:33.035 --> 02:47:36.265
Your king, such as he is...

02:47:36.375 --> 02:47:38.535
I leave to you...

02:47:38.645 --> 02:47:41.075
and what God will make of him.

02:47:41.175 --> 02:47:43.305
No one will be harmed.

02:47:43.415 --> 02:47:45.675
I swear to God.

02:47:45.785 --> 02:47:50.014
The Christians butchered every Muslim
within the walls when they took this city.

02:47:50.114 --> 02:47:52.914
I am not those men.

02:47:53.024 --> 02:47:55.484
I am Saladin.

02:47:55.594 --> 02:47:58.254
Saladin.

02:48:08.974 --> 02:48:13.064
Then under these terms,
I surrender Jerusalem.

02:48:14.344 --> 02:48:16.244
Salaam alaikum.

02:48:16.344 --> 02:48:19.074
And peace be with you.

02:48:23.414 --> 02:48:25.853
What is Jerusalem worth?

02:48:27.383 --> 02:48:29.283
Nothing.

02:48:35.163 --> 02:48:37.063
Everything.

02:49:17.802 --> 02:49:20.742
I have surrendered Jerusalem.

02:49:20.842 --> 02:49:24.332
All will be safely escorted to the sea.

02:49:26.912 --> 02:49:29.672
If this is the kingdom of heaven...

02:49:33.222 --> 02:49:35.682
let God do with it as he wills.

02:49:47.801 --> 02:49:50.891
Balian!

02:49:51.001 --> 02:49:53.031
Balian!

02:49:53.141 --> 02:49:55.401
Yes! Thanks to the Lord!

02:50:10.921 --> 02:50:14.520
Your brother's kingdom was here... and here.

02:50:16.290 --> 02:50:19.590
That kingdom can never be surrendered.

02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:28.230
What should I do?

02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:34.940
I'm still the queen of
Acre, Ashkelon, Tripoli.

02:50:36.050 --> 02:50:38.740
Decide not to be a queen...

02:50:38.850 --> 02:50:41.320
and I will come to you.

02:51:10.609 --> 02:51:12.909
The perfect knight.

02:51:13.019 --> 02:51:15.139
Is that what you think you are, is it?

02:51:30.128 --> 02:51:32.158
We are all of us what we do.

02:52:42.366 --> 02:52:44.336
Do it.

02:52:49.246 --> 02:52:51.536
When you rise again...

02:52:51.646 --> 02:52:53.666
if you rise...

02:52:55.286 --> 02:52:58.116
rise a knight.

02:54:11.454 --> 02:54:14.054
This horse...

02:54:16.124 --> 02:54:18.753
is not a very good horse.

02:54:18.863 --> 02:54:21.123
I will not keep it.

02:54:22.563 --> 02:54:25.363
Thank you.

02:54:26.973 --> 02:54:29.203
And if God does not love you...

02:54:29.303 --> 02:54:33.263
how could you have done all
the things that you have done?

02:54:34.743 --> 02:54:36.973
Peace be upon you.

02:54:38.413 --> 02:54:40.543
Alaikum salaam.

02:56:51.679 --> 02:56:53.649
A queen never walks.

02:57:00.689 --> 02:57:02.919
And yet you are walking.

02:58:21.027 --> 02:58:24.367
Forward!

02:58:25.837 --> 02:58:27.806
Forward!

02:58:32.146 --> 02:58:34.106
Halt!

02:58:37.346 --> 02:58:40.286
We crusade to recover
the kingdom of Jerusalem.

02:58:45.126 --> 02:58:48.246
You go to where the men speak Italian...

02:58:48.356 --> 02:58:52.016
and then continue until
they speak something else.

02:58:59.966 --> 02:59:02.735
We've come by this road to find Balian...

02:59:02.835 --> 02:59:04.935
who was defender of Jerusalem.

02:59:06.175 --> 02:59:09.075
I am the blacksmith.

02:59:10.715 --> 02:59:13.615
And I am the king of England.

02:59:13.715 --> 02:59:16.115
I am the blacksmith.

02:59:19.385 --> 02:59:23.415
Formation! Forward!
