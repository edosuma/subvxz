00:22.394 --> 00:24.228
Here! The chest.

00:24.230 --> 00:25.632
Now, Vincent.

00:35.274 --> 00:37.710
Get ready,
we've almost got him.

00:45.216 --> 00:47.086
Now! Do it now.

01:01.468 --> 01:03.433
Vincent, we did it.

01:03.435 --> 01:05.904
Mortifer, did...
did we...

01:05.906 --> 01:08.005
Yes. We got him.

01:08.007 --> 01:09.606
That's all 13.

01:09.608 --> 01:11.609
It's done.

01:15.647 --> 01:18.850
"Done"? Hardly.
Evil's minions

01:18.852 --> 01:20.817
will stop at nothing
to open this chest

01:20.819 --> 01:25.288
and release once more the plague
of their 13 masters upon our realm.

01:25.290 --> 01:28.359
- We have a duty, Mortifer.
- Of course.

01:28.361 --> 01:31.195
We need to split up if we're
going to have a chance.

01:31.197 --> 01:33.964
- Give me the chest.
- No, it's too dangerous.

01:33.966 --> 01:37.069
- I won't let you.
- Then run. I'll distract them.

01:47.712 --> 01:49.915
Go! There's no time.

01:54.453 --> 01:55.886
Ahh!

02:00.359 --> 02:03.660
Oh, no! No!

02:08.701 --> 02:10.002
Mortifer...

02:13.306 --> 02:15.805
<i>Once upon
a demon chest</i>

02:15.807 --> 02:18.844
<i>Where evil spirits manifest</i>

02:20.180 --> 02:23.648
<i>The best of friends
began a quest</i>

02:23.650 --> 02:26.649
<i>And set out like
a thing possessed</i>

02:26.651 --> 02:29.286
<i>In every corner of the land</i>

02:29.288 --> 02:33.223
<i>With a kid named Flim Flam
and a van</i>

02:33.225 --> 02:36.125
<i>And steely hearts
at their command</i>

02:36.127 --> 02:40.097
<i>They faced their fears
and made their stand</i>

02:40.099 --> 02:43.701
<i>They thwarted
evil Maldor's thirst</i>

02:43.703 --> 02:47.103
<i>And broke
the shadow demon's curse</i>

02:47.105 --> 02:49.673
<i>And off
to Marrakesh traversed</i>

02:49.675 --> 02:53.643
<i>To rendezvous
with something worse</i>

02:53.645 --> 02:57.982
<i>From witches
quoting magic rhyme</i>

02:57.984 --> 03:01.288
<i>To speeding up
the sands of time</i>

03:02.788 --> 03:06.123
<i>Into Demondo's
comic crime</i>

03:06.125 --> 03:09.626
<i>They fought
and caught the demon Slime</i>

03:09.628 --> 03:12.895
<i>Phantazmo, Rankor, Zimbulu</i>

03:12.897 --> 03:15.866
<i>Do these sound like
good guys to you?</i>

03:15.868 --> 03:19.002
<i>Well, thanks to our
intrepid crew,</i>

03:19.004 --> 03:22.207
<i>Into the chest
they each withdrew</i>

03:24.176 --> 03:27.911
<i>But now their hunt
is nearly through</i>

03:27.913 --> 03:30.582
<i>Their final mystery, pursue</i>

03:30.584 --> 03:33.951
<i>And capture
one last bugaboo</i>

03:33.953 --> 03:38.422
<i>The 13th ghost
of Scooby-Doo.</i>

03:53.973 --> 03:56.139
There he is!

04:01.948 --> 04:03.246
Ow!

04:03.248 --> 04:04.881
- Hey! Watch it!
- What are you doing, Fred?

04:04.883 --> 04:06.483
He's getting away!

04:06.485 --> 04:09.721
Daphne, you should never
run on a moving escalator.

04:09.723 --> 04:12.256
- Safety first.
- Can we at least walk?

04:12.258 --> 04:14.324
Um, better not chance it.

04:29.774 --> 04:30.841
Now, what?

04:30.843 --> 04:32.843
Relax, everybody.

04:32.845 --> 04:37.147
The real trick of leadership is
seeing the whole situation from above.

04:37.149 --> 04:39.584
Like the very top of,
say, uh...

04:39.586 --> 04:41.517
a human pyramid.

04:41.519 --> 04:44.823
That's how you get the best out of
your team and plan your next move.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.396
That-a-way.

04:50.696 --> 04:53.197
You see?
Great work, Scooby.

04:53.199 --> 04:54.367
Come on, gang!

04:59.137 --> 05:01.070
All right, we're right behind ya!

05:01.072 --> 05:03.175
Oh, yeah.

05:14.821 --> 05:15.985
We got him.

05:15.987 --> 05:17.887
- Follow me.
- Um...

05:17.889 --> 05:20.223
Shouldn't we booby-trap the
doorway in case he tries to escape?

05:20.225 --> 05:24.495
Daphne, I think I know when and
when not to booby-trap a doorway.

05:24.497 --> 05:25.863
Let's go.

05:30.101 --> 05:31.170
Hmm.

05:42.680 --> 05:43.848
Jinkies!

05:50.456 --> 05:51.687
- Uh-oh.
- Zoinks!

05:55.494 --> 05:59.165
Now let's see who old
Farmer Morgan really is.

05:59.865 --> 06:01.964
Ow!

06:01.966 --> 06:04.101
- That's odd.
- Let me try.

06:04.103 --> 06:07.572
Ow! Stop that! That's my face!

06:07.574 --> 06:11.474
Looks like this ghost went a
little heavy on the spirit gum.

06:13.379 --> 06:16.747
I don't understand. If it's not
a mask, then that means he's...

06:16.749 --> 06:18.682
the real Farmer Morgan.

06:18.684 --> 06:20.384
That doesn't make sense.

06:20.386 --> 06:23.420
Farmer Morgan is selling
the mall half his farmland

06:23.422 --> 06:24.721
for their big expansion.

06:24.723 --> 06:27.457
If it goes out of business,
he'll lose millions.

06:27.459 --> 06:30.461
So, like, why does he want
to shut this place down?

06:30.463 --> 06:32.396
He doesn't.

06:32.398 --> 06:35.231
Morgan didn't stage
the mall haunting.

06:35.233 --> 06:38.235
Mrs. Malvo, the owner did.

06:38.237 --> 06:40.303
And I would've gotten away
with it, too,

06:40.305 --> 06:42.639
if you'd left the meddling
to these kids.

06:42.641 --> 06:44.408
But then why
was he running?

06:44.410 --> 06:45.841
I'm afraid of teenagers.

06:45.843 --> 06:47.945
Hold the phone.

06:47.947 --> 06:49.480
You mean...

06:49.482 --> 06:50.781
we were wrong?

06:50.783 --> 06:53.483
The term is
"criminally negligent."

06:53.485 --> 06:54.752
Criminal?

06:54.754 --> 06:57.320
How many times do I have
to tell you kids?

06:57.322 --> 06:59.123
Mystery-solving
is a tough business.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.457
Even for the pros.

07:00.459 --> 07:02.558
There's no room
for mistakes.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.461
You're almost 18.

07:04.463 --> 07:07.464
After that, if somebody like
Morgan presses harassment charges,

07:07.466 --> 07:09.533
you're looking
at prison time.

07:09.535 --> 07:11.101
Like, gulp!

07:11.103 --> 07:13.202
But this business is too
dangerous for slip-ups.

07:13.204 --> 07:14.605
- Case in point.
- Huh?

07:14.607 --> 07:16.272
She's getting away!

07:19.845 --> 07:21.911
It's over, kids.

07:21.913 --> 07:25.014
From now on, there's only one
mystery-solving crime stopper in this town.

07:25.016 --> 07:26.649
And he wears
a badge.

07:26.651 --> 07:28.151
Also this cool hat.

07:28.153 --> 07:30.053
Let me be
absolutely clear.

07:30.055 --> 07:33.723
If I see you driving that Mystery
Machine of yours one more mile,

07:33.725 --> 07:35.094
I'm putting you away.

07:37.196 --> 07:39.762
Also, we do have
a leash law in this town,

07:39.764 --> 07:42.134
so, you know. Thanks.

07:51.209 --> 07:54.245
I don't understand why we
have to unload everything.

07:54.247 --> 07:57.180
I can't believe I just sold
the Mystery Machine.

07:57.182 --> 07:59.784
Freddie, no one said
it would be easy to retire.

07:59.786 --> 08:01.752
It sure looks easy
for those two.

08:01.754 --> 08:03.954
This is
the life, Scoob.

08:03.956 --> 08:06.490
No more mysteries,
no more ghosts,

08:06.492 --> 08:09.159
and no more year-round
fancy attire.

08:09.161 --> 08:11.428
Hey, I like your style.

08:11.430 --> 08:12.596
Thank you.

08:13.865 --> 08:15.235
Ooh.

08:16.903 --> 08:18.834
This just doesn't
feel right.

08:18.836 --> 08:20.437
I love my Mystery Machine.

08:20.439 --> 08:23.141
I feel like I just sold
part of myself.

08:24.776 --> 08:26.310
I know how you feel, Daphne.

08:26.312 --> 08:28.012
But it's not like
we have a choice.

08:28.014 --> 08:29.613
Besides, it's already done.

08:29.615 --> 08:31.481
We've already closed
all our cases

08:31.483 --> 08:34.217
and have absolutely
no unfinished business.

08:34.220 --> 08:37.054
- None whatsoever.
- Eureka!

08:37.056 --> 08:39.089
How much for
the crystal ball?

08:40.293 --> 08:41.756
We have a crystal ball?

08:41.759 --> 08:44.594
Um, I don't think...

08:44.596 --> 08:46.497
Like, put that thing away!

08:50.602 --> 08:51.901
Oh, man.

08:51.903 --> 08:53.436
I know that glow.

08:53.438 --> 08:56.573
<i>Shaggy? Shaggy, is that you?</i>

08:56.575 --> 08:59.108
Did that thing just...

08:59.110 --> 09:03.046
<i>Kids, I've been trying to reach
you on this thing for months.</i>

09:03.048 --> 09:04.882
<i>Daphne, Shaggy,</i>

09:04.884 --> 09:07.450
<i>Scooby-Doo, where are you?</i>

09:07.452 --> 09:09.453
We're here.
What's up, Vincent?

09:09.455 --> 09:12.855
- "Vincent"?
- I think he prefers "Mr. Van Ghoul."

09:12.857 --> 09:14.592
<i>No, "Vincent" is fine.</i>

09:14.594 --> 09:16.359
<i>Listen, I found him.</i>

09:16.361 --> 09:18.395
<i>Or rather he's found me.</i>

09:18.397 --> 09:19.597
Oh, no.

09:19.599 --> 09:22.465
- You mean...
- <i>The 13th and final ghost.</i>

09:22.467 --> 09:24.633
<i>You must come at once
to catch him,</i>

09:24.635 --> 09:27.470
<i>so we can seal
the chest of demons forever.</i>

09:27.472 --> 09:29.873
<i>Hurry, I can't hold
him off any long...</i>

09:29.875 --> 09:31.275
Vincent?

09:31.277 --> 09:32.508
Vincent?

09:34.446 --> 09:36.946
Like, I guess we've got some
unfinished business after all.

09:36.948 --> 09:39.516
Who is Vincent Van Ghoul?

09:39.518 --> 09:41.417
What's a chest
of demons?

09:41.419 --> 09:43.454
And will you take
a personal check?

09:43.456 --> 09:47.056
- No!
- All right, it's just a question.

09:47.058 --> 09:50.227
Daphne, are you gonna tell
us what's going on here?

09:50.229 --> 09:52.662
We said we'd never
talk about this.

09:52.664 --> 09:54.098
We have no choice.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.900
Vincent's in trouble
and it's all our fault.

09:56.902 --> 09:58.301
"Our fault"?

09:58.303 --> 10:01.338
Listen, something happened.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.507
That summer you were
both away at camp.

10:03.509 --> 10:06.576
- Real ghosts?
- Don't be silly.

10:06.578 --> 10:08.478
Ah-ha, there it is.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.648
Ugh, how did I ever think
this was practical?

10:12.650 --> 10:13.850
This is insane.

10:13.852 --> 10:16.252
I can't believe you
never told us about this.

10:16.254 --> 10:19.256
The whole experience
really traumatized Scooby.

10:19.258 --> 10:21.425
He almost had
a nervous breakdown.

10:21.427 --> 10:24.728
So we decided,
never to bring it up again.

10:24.730 --> 10:26.863
But you said
there were 13 ghosts,

10:26.865 --> 10:28.299
and you only
caught 12.

10:28.301 --> 10:30.501
Didn't you think with one
still on the loose

10:30.503 --> 10:32.569
that it might come up
again someday?

10:32.571 --> 10:35.339
Listen, if you're worried
about Scooby, don't be.

10:35.341 --> 10:37.306
He's conquered
his demons.

10:37.308 --> 10:39.011
Twelve of them, at least.

10:39.812 --> 10:41.710
Yes.

10:54.659 --> 10:55.761
What do you think?

10:59.230 --> 11:01.533
Whoa. Who are you?

11:08.907 --> 11:10.940
What are you two wearing?

11:10.942 --> 11:12.542
Not nearly enough.

11:12.544 --> 11:13.810
Nuh-uh.

11:13.812 --> 11:16.378
Relax, boys. We've
handled 12 of these.

11:16.380 --> 11:18.081
Will one more kill us?

11:18.083 --> 11:20.349
Like, dude, that's
the question, isn't it?

11:20.351 --> 11:22.219
Well, we'd love
to help you, Daph,

11:22.221 --> 11:24.253
but I just sold
the Mystery Machine, so...

11:24.255 --> 11:26.591
Don't worry.
I've got it covered.

11:30.763 --> 11:32.362
You have a van, too?

11:32.364 --> 11:33.930
It's not a van.

11:33.932 --> 11:37.167
It's a strategic, all-terrain
mobile command unit.

11:37.169 --> 11:40.237
- It looks like a van.
- It was a van,

11:40.239 --> 11:42.772
then Vincent had
a few upgrades installed.

11:42.774 --> 11:44.608
"MM"?

11:44.610 --> 11:47.877
Don't worry, Freddie, there can
be only one Mystery Machine.

11:47.879 --> 11:49.345
What does it stand for then?

11:49.347 --> 11:52.049
Let me guess.
"the Miss-tery Machine"?

11:52.051 --> 11:55.651
Um, no, but that's way better.
Let's call it that.

11:55.653 --> 11:59.055
Okay, whatever, everybody
hop in and, uh...

11:59.057 --> 12:01.157
Oh, wait, wait.
This is a stick.

12:01.159 --> 12:02.526
I can't drive
a stick.

12:02.528 --> 12:05.531
Everybody in.
We're burning daylight.

12:24.182 --> 12:28.484
Grand tome? Please, it's barely 800
pages and most of it's the index.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.453
- Velma.
- What do you want me to say?

12:30.455 --> 12:34.791
It's full of nonsense like, "The
chest of demons can only be opened

12:34.793 --> 12:36.160
"by the living."

12:36.162 --> 12:38.361
- That's true.
- Of course, it's true.

12:38.363 --> 12:40.464
Because the dead
don't open things.

12:40.466 --> 12:42.398
They don't do anything.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.967
They're dead!

12:45.636 --> 12:47.737
Anything about
the 13th ghost?

12:47.739 --> 12:49.672
Well, according
to what you've told me,

12:49.674 --> 12:53.209
the one that got away
is Asmodeus. King of demons.

12:53.211 --> 12:55.512
The most powerful
of all evil spirits.

12:57.249 --> 13:00.184
Oh, man, like we should've
gotten rid of that crystal ball

13:00.186 --> 13:01.719
when we had the chance.

13:05.124 --> 13:07.326
Oh, it's just an old story.

13:09.561 --> 13:12.896
- What the...
- There's no such thing as ghosts.

13:12.898 --> 13:16.166
You think we were born cowards?

13:16.168 --> 13:17.935
Sister,

13:17.937 --> 13:19.935
the reason we're always on
edge around ghouls and goblins,

13:19.937 --> 13:23.006
even fake ones, is that
we've seen and fought 12

13:23.008 --> 13:24.309
of the real thing.

13:32.784 --> 13:34.316
Hang on, gang.

13:36.121 --> 13:37.454
What's going on?

13:47.332 --> 13:48.897
Whoa, what's happening?

13:48.899 --> 13:50.934
I thought someone was
tailing us, but I guess...

13:56.174 --> 13:57.340
Yikes!

14:09.321 --> 14:11.456
I... I hope
he's got insurance.

14:15.793 --> 14:18.328
- Insurance follows the driver, right?
- Yes!

14:18.330 --> 14:20.733
Well, then we've
got a problem.

14:40.284 --> 14:43.286
Shaggy, Scooby, pull it together
and deploy countermeasures.

14:43.288 --> 14:45.021
Countermeasures?

14:45.023 --> 14:46.392
Huh?

14:48.159 --> 14:49.794
Here goes nothing.

14:52.297 --> 14:54.300
It shoots oil slicks?

15:00.304 --> 15:01.539
Take that.

15:08.679 --> 15:10.412
That ought to keep
him busy.

15:10.414 --> 15:12.517
It has a smoke screen?

15:15.788 --> 15:16.956
Phew.

15:30.201 --> 15:32.971
Somebody really doesn't
want us on the road.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.406
Well, why didn't
they just say so?

15:39.745 --> 15:41.945
That's a pretty
sharp turn back there, Daph.

15:41.947 --> 15:44.214
Maybe you should slow down.
You know, safety...

15:44.216 --> 15:46.384
First!

15:55.427 --> 15:57.160
Ah!

16:20.318 --> 16:22.921
That was awesome!

16:27.058 --> 16:29.060
This will be
faster anyway.

16:46.244 --> 16:47.544
Vincent lives here?

16:47.546 --> 16:49.979
Only during winter.
He's a snowbird.

16:55.019 --> 16:56.855
More like a snow bat.

17:05.230 --> 17:08.198
That's odd. The door's open.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.934
Come on, gang, let's...

17:12.538 --> 17:14.970
Let's follow Daphne inside.

17:14.972 --> 17:17.873
- No way.
- I'm with you, Scooby-Doo.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.878
Like, no way are we stepping
through those doors.

17:22.146 --> 17:23.412
Huh?

17:23.414 --> 17:24.513
Me?

17:24.516 --> 17:25.848
Uh-huh.

17:25.851 --> 17:28.617
Uh.
Okay... Say, guys.

17:28.619 --> 17:30.754
- Would you do it for a couple of...
- Ahem.

17:30.756 --> 17:33.690
One. You start with one
and then we haggle.

17:33.692 --> 17:36.225
Where did you two
learn to haggle?

17:36.227 --> 17:38.027
Flim Flam, of course.

17:38.029 --> 17:39.962
- Flim Flam?
- The little huckster who used to travel around

17:39.964 --> 17:41.765
catching ghosts
with us?

17:41.767 --> 17:43.866
About 3'6"? Sold us all
those bottles of snake oil

17:43.868 --> 17:45.567
we unloaded
at the garage sale?

17:45.569 --> 17:46.902
We never mentioned
Flim Flam?

17:46.904 --> 17:49.838
Vincent Van Ghoul?
The chest of demons?

17:49.840 --> 17:51.641
The Miss-tery Machine?

17:51.643 --> 17:54.076
And now a whole
other member of the gang?

17:54.078 --> 17:56.478
There's a lot
you never mentioned.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.516
Excuse me,
I believe we were haggling?

17:59.518 --> 18:01.551
Look, I'm gonna say
one Scooby Snack,

18:01.553 --> 18:04.353
you're gonna say three and
then we settle on two, okay?

18:04.355 --> 18:05.857
Let's just cut
to the chase.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.562
Like, easiest
negotiation ever.

18:12.564 --> 18:15.865
- Thanks, Daphne.
- Uh, I'm Fred. Not Daphne.

18:15.867 --> 18:16.969
Uh-huh.

18:26.612 --> 18:27.809
Ugh.

18:27.811 --> 18:29.746
This place
gives me the creeps.

18:29.748 --> 18:31.849
I thought you didn't
believe in creeps.

18:31.851 --> 18:33.749
I'm starting to believe
in a couple.

18:39.124 --> 18:41.157
The place looks deserted.

18:41.159 --> 18:44.260
If Vincent took off, maybe he left
a clue as to where he's headed.

18:44.262 --> 18:46.194
Let's split up.

18:46.196 --> 18:48.498
Scoob and I will check the pantry,
the kitchens, and the snackatorium.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.802
- "The snackatorium"?
- Like, I'm sure that's a thing.

18:51.804 --> 18:54.036
Where's your sense
of discovery?

19:00.077 --> 19:03.013
You better keep an eye
on Lewis and Bark over there.

19:03.015 --> 19:04.049
Got it.

19:08.487 --> 19:09.822
What's that?

19:12.190 --> 19:13.690
That's strange.

19:13.692 --> 19:15.728
I wonder...

19:19.932 --> 19:21.430
What do you think
it means?

19:21.432 --> 19:22.931
They work like phones.

19:22.933 --> 19:25.301
Vincent called us
on this crystal ball

19:25.303 --> 19:28.171
which means he was calling
from another crystal ball.

19:28.173 --> 19:29.974
So maybe...

19:32.442 --> 19:34.009
It's a homing beacon.

19:34.011 --> 19:37.013
The two crystal balls
are connected somehow.

19:37.015 --> 19:39.882
- So...
- All we have to do is follow the glow,

19:39.884 --> 19:41.383
and we'll find Vincent.

19:41.385 --> 19:42.818
Fingers crossed.
Come on.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.554
- Oops, sorry.
- Oh! Sorry. My fault.

19:44.556 --> 19:45.988
- No, you first.
- My fault.

19:45.990 --> 19:47.960
Go ahead, I'll follow you.

19:54.599 --> 19:57.601
Like this sure beats searching
the dungeons.

19:57.603 --> 19:59.102
Right, Scoob ol' buddy?

19:59.104 --> 20:00.239
Indeed.

20:05.109 --> 20:06.277
Huh.

20:07.345 --> 20:09.511
Yep, as I suspected.

20:09.513 --> 20:12.748
This pulley system must run
throughout the entire castle.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.183
All right, Miss Skeptic.

20:14.185 --> 20:17.152
But that doesn't
explain the howling wind.

20:17.154 --> 20:21.190
Oh, hey, see if you can find some
soup in there, would you, Scoob?

20:21.192 --> 20:22.260
Okay.

20:26.196 --> 20:28.265
What is it? Low sodium?

20:29.968 --> 20:33.335
Like there's nothing to get upset about.
We can always add salt.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.642
Oh, just bring it here.

20:41.579 --> 20:44.148
Like, hey!

20:45.884 --> 20:47.749
Would you two
knock it off?

20:47.751 --> 20:50.254
We're supposed
to be looking for clues.

20:50.755 --> 20:52.691
Velma, no!

21:03.801 --> 21:05.669
Guys, I found
the howling wind.

21:05.671 --> 21:09.104
It's just a recording played on
a network of hidden speakers.

21:09.106 --> 21:11.844
I knew something was up
as soon as we arrived.

21:15.512 --> 21:17.380
Stop fooling around,
you two.

21:19.049 --> 21:21.886
We need to find out
what the speaker leads to.

21:34.699 --> 21:36.498
I don't get it.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.870
We were led here, but I don't
see Vincent or his crystal ball.

21:39.872 --> 21:41.671
It's a dead end.

21:41.673 --> 21:44.707
There's always a way out, Daph.
You just have to look for it.

21:44.709 --> 21:45.941
Hand me your flashlight.

21:45.943 --> 21:47.376
Ugh, I left it in the van.

21:47.378 --> 21:50.145
Aha, there you go.
You said it. It is a van.

21:50.147 --> 21:52.315
Of course, it's a van.

21:52.317 --> 21:55.721
I just didn't want you to feel
like I was moving in on your turf.

21:56.488 --> 21:57.586
Which I am.

21:57.588 --> 21:59.421
Mmm.

21:59.423 --> 22:02.025
Look, I've been through all
this already when you were away.

22:02.027 --> 22:05.128
I know how to "see the
whole situation from above,"

22:05.130 --> 22:08.331
and "how to plan
the next move." I'm fine.

22:08.333 --> 22:12.635
Well, I'm not. I mean, there
must be something I can do.

22:14.605 --> 22:17.209
Don't do anything.

22:18.509 --> 22:20.309
But, Daphne, I only want to...

22:20.311 --> 22:24.248
No, I mean, don't move.
I think I see something.

22:28.053 --> 22:29.585
A secret passageway.

22:29.587 --> 22:31.286
We're back in business.

22:31.288 --> 22:32.458
Come on.

22:34.925 --> 22:36.359
Once Scooby has
the scent,

22:36.361 --> 22:37.994
he'll lead us to
the source of the...

22:37.996 --> 22:40.563
Like I don't need
it Fredsplained to me, Velma.

22:40.565 --> 22:42.297
I'm in. Let's go.

22:42.299 --> 22:44.500
All right, Scooby.
Got the scent?

22:44.502 --> 22:46.067
Uh-huh.

22:46.069 --> 22:48.339
Like, just let me know... Yikes!

22:50.842 --> 22:52.208
Keep it up, Scooby!

22:52.210 --> 22:55.079
Let me down, Scooby!

22:59.484 --> 23:03.286
- Like, what is it?
- Just a false alarm.

23:10.895 --> 23:14.497
Scooby, it's only a couple of...

23:27.278 --> 23:30.447
Well, I'm stumped. This
one really is a dead end.

23:30.449 --> 23:32.414
Maybe we should
head back upstairs.

23:32.416 --> 23:34.351
No, the ball led us here.

23:34.353 --> 23:36.751
This is where
we're supposed to be.

23:36.753 --> 23:38.153
It's probably obvious.

23:38.155 --> 23:40.289
I bet it's about
to hit us right over the head.

23:40.291 --> 23:43.192
Did you hear...

23:44.295 --> 23:47.296
Like, mind if we drop in?

23:47.298 --> 23:49.998
We've looked everywhere, and
there's no sign of Vincent

23:50.000 --> 23:52.267
and no clue as to
where he might've gone.

23:53.404 --> 23:56.074
- What is it, Scooby?
- Vincent. Vincent!

23:56.840 --> 23:58.307
Help me get the lid off.

24:00.511 --> 24:04.346
Vincent.

24:04.348 --> 24:08.517
Oh, Daphne, Shaggy,
thank ghoulness it's you.

24:08.519 --> 24:10.119
Hello, Vincent.

24:10.121 --> 24:14.090
And Scooby-Doo,
oh, how I've missed you all.

24:14.092 --> 24:17.093
Especially
these last few weeks.

24:17.095 --> 24:18.527
It's Asmodeus.

24:18.529 --> 24:19.863
Like, we know.

24:19.865 --> 24:21.930
We read all about him
on the way here.

24:21.932 --> 24:23.998
No, I mean, there

24:24.000 --> 24:25.602
in the shadows.

24:42.153 --> 24:44.953
Now, kids,
open the chest of demons.

24:44.955 --> 24:47.457
Yes, the chest.

24:47.459 --> 24:49.225
Bring me the chest.

24:49.227 --> 24:51.496
You don't
have to tell me twice.

24:52.696 --> 24:54.296
Like, where is it?

24:54.298 --> 24:56.798
- Didn't you bring it with you?
- We thought you had it.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.301
No, I left it with you.

24:58.303 --> 25:00.670
And I mailed it back to you
when school started.

25:00.672 --> 25:03.506
- Where did you send it?
- Your real house.

25:03.508 --> 25:04.873
In the Himalayas.

25:08.046 --> 25:11.146
That wasn't my house!
It was an AirBoo 'N Boo!

25:11.148 --> 25:14.316
Give it to me!

25:14.318 --> 25:18.854
It's not here. If you want it, you're
gonna have to go find it yourself.

25:27.531 --> 25:28.597
Where did he go?

25:28.599 --> 25:29.998
To find the chest.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.835
As long as he holds it,
it can't hold him.

25:32.837 --> 25:35.770
We must find it
before he does.

25:35.772 --> 25:37.440
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

25:37.442 --> 25:38.609
Through here.

25:40.111 --> 25:43.513
King Solomon's private vault.

25:58.630 --> 26:00.332
The chest of demons.

26:05.702 --> 26:07.071
I think I hit something.

26:12.943 --> 26:18.213
One of the most important
archaeological discoveries in history.

26:18.215 --> 26:21.683
Vincent, we are going
to be famous.

26:21.685 --> 26:23.920
No, it's too dangerous.

26:23.922 --> 26:25.653
The chest exists.

26:25.655 --> 26:29.158
The demon chest in which
Solomon trapped the 13 ghosts

26:29.160 --> 26:30.959
that plagued
the ancient world.

26:30.961 --> 26:35.232
The evil contained in this box
was never meant to be released.

26:36.133 --> 26:38.200
Vincent, what's wrong?

26:38.202 --> 26:40.036
The lock.
The crowbar must've...

26:58.923 --> 27:00.689
So, what happened?

27:00.691 --> 27:04.826
Mortifer and I tracked down and
trapped all 13 of the ghosts

27:04.828 --> 27:06.563
in the chest of demons.

27:06.565 --> 27:08.529
And that's where
they remained.

27:08.531 --> 27:10.866
Until these two
let them out.

27:10.868 --> 27:13.303
Well, at least, we've caught
12 of the ghosts.

27:13.305 --> 27:14.937
Who did they turn
out to be?

27:14.939 --> 27:18.173
Crooked real estate agents?
Disinherited step-children?

27:18.175 --> 27:20.276
Vengeful lighthouse keepers?

27:20.278 --> 27:23.312
Velma, we keep telling you.
They are real ghosts.

27:23.314 --> 27:26.882
- Uh-huh.
- And one is still on the loose.

27:26.884 --> 27:28.351
Asmodeus.

27:28.353 --> 27:30.452
The 13th and most powerful.

27:30.454 --> 27:33.689
How I had hoped he'd vanish
from this realm for good.

27:33.691 --> 27:37.160
I faced him once
before, of course,

27:37.162 --> 27:39.495
but Mortifer
was by my side then.

27:39.497 --> 27:41.500
Whatever happened
to Mortifer?

27:46.104 --> 27:49.372
We said we would protect
the chest with our lives.

27:49.374 --> 27:52.007
And that's what he did,
brave soul.

27:52.009 --> 27:54.477
He paid for
my foolishness then

27:54.479 --> 27:56.444
just as you're
paying for it now.

27:56.446 --> 27:58.479
Like, speaking of paying.

27:58.481 --> 28:00.516
I hope this portrait
was cheap.

28:00.518 --> 28:03.387
It doesn't look anything like you.

28:04.955 --> 28:09.191
Well, sticking around here
jabbering would be a grave mistake.

28:09.193 --> 28:13.094
We have to get to the Himalayas
before Asmodeus finds the chest.

28:13.096 --> 28:14.331
But how?

28:34.285 --> 28:36.121
Uh, cranapple, please.

28:37.855 --> 28:39.188
Peanuts or cookies?

28:39.190 --> 28:40.792
Uh, one of each?

28:41.558 --> 28:43.127
Oh, my.

28:46.064 --> 28:48.230
This sure is a neat jet,
Mr. Van Ghoul.

28:48.232 --> 28:49.465
Thank you, Fred.

28:49.467 --> 28:52.101
You'd think I paid
dearly for it.

28:52.103 --> 28:53.501
But you'd be wrong.

28:53.503 --> 28:56.404
Dead wrong.

28:56.406 --> 28:59.208
See, Daphne? I don't
mind being chauffeured.

28:59.210 --> 29:02.311
As long as it's a highly-skilled
professional at the wheel.

29:02.313 --> 29:05.148
Uh-huh. Say, have you
met the pilot yet?

29:05.150 --> 29:06.449
You should introduce
yourself.

29:06.451 --> 29:08.385
Don't mind if I do.

29:12.256 --> 29:13.756
Like, come on in.

29:13.758 --> 29:15.224
Shaggy?

29:15.226 --> 29:16.825
Shaggy?

29:16.827 --> 29:19.027
It's "Captain Rogers"
up here, young man.

29:19.029 --> 29:22.465
Not for vanity, but because
when you got 10 tons of steel

29:22.467 --> 29:24.565
and the lives of every
passenger in your hands,

29:24.567 --> 29:27.003
it's best to think of
yourself as the office,

29:27.005 --> 29:28.269
not the man.

29:28.271 --> 29:31.340
Also, a little bit
for vanity.

29:31.342 --> 29:33.508
Uh, Stewardess?

29:33.510 --> 29:35.911
That's "flight attendant."

29:35.913 --> 29:37.816
Whatever you say,
toots.

29:45.155 --> 29:46.988
One thing's bugging me,
Vincent.

29:46.990 --> 29:48.391
Castle Van Ghoul...

29:48.393 --> 29:50.892
The rigged shutters?
The recorded howling?

29:50.894 --> 29:55.029
- That's right! Was that...
- My security system.

29:55.031 --> 29:56.431
Keeps everyone away.

29:56.433 --> 29:58.901
I knew it! Not that
it wasn't convincing.

29:58.903 --> 30:01.903
- But ghosts aren't real.
- I wish that were true.

30:01.905 --> 30:04.907
But fear not, Velma,
before we are finished,

30:04.909 --> 30:08.844
I promise you will change your
mind about ghosts and goblins.

30:09.980 --> 30:11.316
Never!

30:22.192 --> 30:25.494
<i>Pshht, hello,
like, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

30:25.496 --> 30:26.996
<i>This is Captain Rogers.</i>

30:26.998 --> 30:29.132
<i>We are now entering
Himalayan airspace.</i>

30:29.134 --> 30:31.534
<i>If you look out to the
right side of the plane,</i>

30:31.536 --> 30:33.803
<i>you'll see a ratty old
haunted temple.</i>

30:33.805 --> 30:35.871
<i>Pshht.</i>

30:35.873 --> 30:38.240
Funny, I don't remember
seeing that courtyard

30:38.242 --> 30:39.975
the first time
we flew in here.

30:39.977 --> 30:43.248
Of course, we were a little
busy crash-landing at the time.

30:45.082 --> 30:47.717
Nope. Hang on. I got it.

30:47.719 --> 30:49.117
This time. Oh!

30:49.119 --> 30:50.586
Ah, drat.

30:50.588 --> 30:53.823
Hang on, I got it,
I got it this time. Drat.

30:53.825 --> 30:59.026
Daphne, my Air Boo n' Boo host
just scream-mailed me back

30:59.028 --> 31:00.997
on my DiePhone.

31:00.999 --> 31:05.234
The package from Shaggy was never
delivered by the ghostal service.

31:07.038 --> 31:08.770
What? One too many puns?

31:08.772 --> 31:10.840
Three too many.
Maybe four.

31:10.842 --> 31:12.040
Where is everybody?

31:12.042 --> 31:14.776
It's a supernatural
capital of the world.

31:14.778 --> 31:17.845
News reports say the whole
village has been evacuated

31:17.847 --> 31:20.783
due to demon infestation.

31:20.785 --> 31:22.116
Asmodeus.

31:22.118 --> 31:24.186
Hey, don't we know
that guy?

31:24.188 --> 31:27.523
He's the 13th ghost. You
just met him at my castle.

31:27.525 --> 31:29.961
No, not him. Him!

31:31.595 --> 31:33.528
I like his style.

31:33.530 --> 31:36.332
That's it. He was at
our garage sale.

31:36.334 --> 31:37.632
He was there.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.567
Oh, yeah, Bernie Alan.

31:39.569 --> 31:41.403
I still have the check
he bounced.

31:41.405 --> 31:43.538
And he's here now?

31:43.540 --> 31:46.342
That's quite a coincidence.

31:46.344 --> 31:48.009
In my experience, Vincent,

31:48.011 --> 31:50.112
there is no such thing.

31:50.114 --> 31:51.913
My opera glasses.

31:51.915 --> 31:54.882
We better keep a close eye
on this Bernie Alan guy.

31:54.884 --> 31:57.021
But not too close,
okay, gang?

32:03.394 --> 32:06.394
We've got a runner. Looks like
he's headed for the temple.

32:06.396 --> 32:09.798
Vincent, you, me, and the boys
are going to follow that tourist.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.401
Velma, Fred, take
the Miss-tery Machine

32:12.403 --> 32:14.306
into town to look
for Shaggy's...

32:15.338 --> 32:18.407
Scare package.

32:18.409 --> 32:21.276
It's possible the post office
has been holding on to it.

32:21.278 --> 32:23.345
But of course,

32:23.347 --> 32:26.382
the dead letter office.
Mail goes in,

32:26.384 --> 32:28.616
but it never comes out.

32:33.625 --> 32:36.528
Sorry, force of havoc.
Eh, habit.

32:39.698 --> 32:40.830
Hello?

32:40.832 --> 32:41.896
Deserted.

32:41.898 --> 32:43.799
Just like the rest
of the village.

32:43.801 --> 32:46.637
Looks like Asmodeus
got here first.

32:47.172 --> 32:48.440
Maybe.

32:50.173 --> 32:51.576
Come on.

32:57.348 --> 32:59.347
We laughed at Vincent,
but he was right.

32:59.349 --> 33:01.049
This place is creepy.

33:01.051 --> 33:04.388
The sooner we find Shaggy's
box, the sooner we can leave.

33:13.631 --> 33:15.029
He looks lost.

33:15.031 --> 33:17.665
I don't fully understand
what we're doing.

33:17.667 --> 33:20.768
Is this all because
of a bounced check?

33:20.770 --> 33:22.571
No, no, you said it yourself.

33:22.573 --> 33:25.607
It's a pretty strange coincidence
this guy showed up here.

33:25.609 --> 33:27.843
I think he knows
something we don't.

33:27.845 --> 33:30.179
Why don't we just
ask him?

33:30.181 --> 33:33.047
Like, the man's a notorious
check bouncer.

33:33.049 --> 33:34.818
We'd never get the truth.

33:36.520 --> 33:37.853
Unless...

33:45.063 --> 33:47.896
Hey, that's right.
Vincent old buddy,

33:47.898 --> 33:50.132
why don't you cast the
truth-telling spell on him?

33:50.134 --> 33:52.267
That ought to
get us some answers.

33:52.269 --> 33:54.603
Right, of course, um...

33:54.605 --> 33:56.138
Let me see.

33:57.708 --> 33:59.409
Did you hear something?

33:59.411 --> 34:01.276
Oh, like, that's just
Scooby's stomach.

34:01.278 --> 34:04.746
He hasn't eaten anything
in over seven minutes.

34:07.018 --> 34:09.385
No, I believe
I heard it, too.

34:09.387 --> 34:11.119
It came from down
the road.

34:11.121 --> 34:13.420
Oh, no, he's gone.

34:13.422 --> 34:15.389
Come on. We've got to...

34:15.391 --> 34:16.824
Excuse me.

34:16.827 --> 34:19.661
No, Scoob, I think
Daphne's right.

34:19.664 --> 34:21.829
It wasn't you! It... It was...

34:32.443 --> 34:35.177
You've gotta be kidding me.

34:35.179 --> 34:36.945
- Like, run!
- Wait.

34:36.947 --> 34:39.282
This is crazy. First the guy
from our garage sale shows up.

34:39.284 --> 34:42.617
Now the car that tried to run us off
the road on our way to find Vincent?

34:42.619 --> 34:44.518
What's the connection?

34:44.521 --> 34:46.954
And then there's
the bigger question.

34:46.956 --> 34:48.692
What's that?

34:50.561 --> 34:53.496
Why isn't it
coming for us right now?

34:59.436 --> 35:02.170
Oh, no.
All that motor revving...

35:03.574 --> 35:04.976
He was starting an...

35:06.143 --> 35:07.778
Avalanche!

35:12.750 --> 35:15.483
Say, Daph,
now can we...

35:15.485 --> 35:17.121
Run!

35:21.090 --> 35:22.125
No!

36:02.333 --> 36:04.202
Oh, my...

36:21.617 --> 36:24.487
I don't think we'll ever finish
checking all these labels.

36:24.489 --> 36:27.523
Hey, come on. Don't give up, Velma.
You can do it.

36:27.525 --> 36:31.061
Velma, Velma, Velma!

36:32.161 --> 36:33.996
V-E-L-M-A.

36:33.998 --> 36:36.331
- She's the one who...
- Why are you doing that?

36:36.333 --> 36:37.599
You're right.

36:37.601 --> 36:40.001
I don't know what
my role is anymore.

36:40.003 --> 36:41.470
Huh? Huh.

36:41.472 --> 36:43.938
- Okay, that was weird.
- I'll go check it out.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.874
Wait, it feels like a trap.

36:45.876 --> 36:48.677
Oh, Velma.
I think I would know

36:48.679 --> 36:50.244
if I was walking...

36:52.483 --> 36:54.150
Oh.

36:54.152 --> 36:55.186
Gotcha.

36:58.422 --> 37:00.322
What's going on here?

37:00.324 --> 37:03.492
What's going on here is that I'm
asking the questions, trespasser.

37:03.494 --> 37:08.363
Fine, but first I have
a few questions for you.

37:08.365 --> 37:11.733
Oh, okay, shoot.

37:11.735 --> 37:14.804
Not sure why you didn't just
check the package registry first.

37:14.806 --> 37:16.738
Seems more efficient,
but what do I know?

37:16.740 --> 37:20.742
According to this, Shaggy's
package was being held here

37:20.744 --> 37:22.478
until this morning.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.146
This morning?
I can't believe we missed it.

37:25.148 --> 37:27.615
We'll just have to keep looking
for the chest of demons.

37:27.617 --> 37:29.385
Wait, wait, wait.
Chest of demons?

37:29.387 --> 37:32.390
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come with me!

38:03.853 --> 38:06.356
I'm getting too old for this!

38:07.791 --> 38:09.861
Run!

38:43.260 --> 38:45.360
Phew.

38:50.134 --> 38:52.901
Well, the good news is that
we made it to the temple.

38:54.304 --> 38:57.207
Like, I think I already know
the bad news.

39:07.583 --> 39:10.485
Looks like those winters at
my uncle's cabin in Aspen

39:10.487 --> 39:12.220
are finally gonna pay off.

39:12.222 --> 39:13.824
Everybody on.

39:40.684 --> 39:43.821
Tree, tree, tree.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.720
Vincent, now would
be the perfect time

40:18.722 --> 40:20.688
for a door-opening spell.

40:20.690 --> 40:22.090
Kids, there's something I...

40:24.161 --> 40:27.498
Come on, Vincent,
like, "Open sesame!"

40:30.900 --> 40:32.867
Hurry, before it's too...

40:37.574 --> 40:40.242
You want your chest of demons?
All right.

40:40.244 --> 40:43.914
Prepare to enter
the realm of darkness.

40:45.115 --> 40:48.583
Can we just
go in? I'm freezing.

40:59.096 --> 41:00.961
Is that the chest
of demons?

41:00.963 --> 41:04.766
- Sure looks like it.
- Well, thank goodness, it's still closed.

41:04.768 --> 41:08.637
Oh, Fred, you're not starting to
believe that nonsense, are you?

41:08.639 --> 41:10.070
Velma, what are you doing?

41:10.072 --> 41:12.342
Fred, it's just a box.

41:17.780 --> 41:19.217
No!

41:21.351 --> 41:22.217
See?

41:22.219 --> 41:23.684
Just an empty old...

41:23.686 --> 41:25.021
Jinkies!

41:32.195 --> 41:33.961
Are you insane? It's...

41:33.963 --> 41:37.099
Double-lined with a vacuum seal
to keep your cold stuff cold

41:37.101 --> 41:38.800
and your hot stuff hot.

41:38.802 --> 41:40.469
It's a cooler?

41:40.471 --> 41:43.137
Of course, it is.

41:43.139 --> 41:45.307
Just a plain old cooler.

41:45.309 --> 41:48.409
Oh, well, if you're looking
for something fancier,

41:48.411 --> 41:50.177
we've got it all.

41:50.179 --> 41:53.180
Chest of Demons coolers,
Chest of Demons lunchboxes,

41:53.182 --> 41:55.851
phone chargers,
you name it, we got it.

41:55.853 --> 41:58.619
And it's all celebrating the
relic that made this village

41:58.621 --> 42:01.021
the tourism capital
of the Himalayas.

42:01.023 --> 42:04.094
At prices so low,
it's demonic.

42:04.961 --> 42:06.827
Come on, Fred.

42:06.829 --> 42:10.798
Uh, I can probably cut
you a deal if you buy four.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.300
Or three?

42:12.302 --> 42:15.603
- Two.
- Have you ever actually sold one?

42:15.605 --> 42:18.639
Once, a long time ago.

42:20.376 --> 42:23.512
Sorry, but we're looking
for the real chest of demons.

42:23.514 --> 42:26.382
The real one? You
mean up at the temple?

42:26.384 --> 42:30.485
At least, it used to be there. No,
you wouldn't want to go to that place.

42:30.487 --> 42:31.887
Trust me.

42:31.889 --> 42:35.057
- Why not?
- Uh, you're not ghost hunters, are you?

42:35.059 --> 42:37.394
In fact, we are.

42:42.465 --> 42:44.999
Now say you've got
trouble with a capital T

42:45.001 --> 42:46.400
like the one in "tormented"
and "terrified"

42:46.402 --> 42:48.003
and "truly trick-or-treatify."

42:48.005 --> 42:49.903
- Huh?
- I'm talking about ghosts.

42:49.905 --> 42:52.541
I'm talking about goblins,
ghouls, and beasts galore.

42:52.543 --> 42:54.443
To fight off fiends,
and freaks, and more,

42:54.445 --> 42:56.411
you need a monster
weapons store.

42:56.413 --> 42:59.615
A laser-guided harpoon gun
will take down that leviathan.

42:59.617 --> 43:03.184
This silver-bullet cannon, yes, for
stopping werewolves with success.

43:03.186 --> 43:07.155
A garlic bomb applied with speed
will vex a vampire guaranteed.

43:07.157 --> 43:09.057
So, monster hunters,
come on down,

43:09.059 --> 43:12.793
you'll soon be saying that you found
the lowest rental rates around.

43:12.795 --> 43:16.266
Here at Benny's Monster Town!

43:18.668 --> 43:21.702
I'm guessing you haven't
seen our commercial?

43:21.704 --> 43:24.972
Nope, but, man,
you got some terrific rhymes.

43:24.974 --> 43:28.108
Well, with all the superstitious
tourists coming through here,

43:28.110 --> 43:30.010
I'll bet you do
quite a business.

43:30.012 --> 43:31.278
What can I say?

43:31.280 --> 43:34.150
Fighting the undead,
it's a living.

43:34.885 --> 43:37.151
Whoa, neat.

43:37.153 --> 43:39.121
Give her a test run.

43:39.123 --> 43:41.590
- You can drive stick, right?
- Of cou...

43:41.592 --> 43:43.157
Um...

43:43.159 --> 43:45.059
Just kidding.

43:45.061 --> 43:46.894
It practically drives itself.

43:50.333 --> 43:53.568
Now, what can I
interest you in?

43:53.570 --> 43:56.104
Nothing, I don't believe
in ghosts.

43:56.106 --> 43:57.671
What do you believe in?

43:57.673 --> 43:58.874
Science.

43:58.876 --> 44:01.443
Just because science
can't explain ghosts yet,

44:01.445 --> 44:03.644
doesn't make them
any less real.

44:03.646 --> 44:05.414
Nah, nice try.

44:05.416 --> 44:07.581
You're a good salesman,
but not that good.

44:07.583 --> 44:10.084
We believe in facts,
not fantasy.

44:10.086 --> 44:11.422
Right, Fred?

44:11.855 --> 44:14.289
Huh?

44:14.291 --> 44:16.590
- I said we're leaving.
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

44:16.592 --> 44:20.128
Listen, it's really dangerous
out there after dark.

44:20.130 --> 44:22.429
Thank you!

44:22.431 --> 44:24.233
Can you believe
that guy?

44:24.235 --> 44:26.534
Whew, I know,
what talent.

44:26.536 --> 44:29.637
And between the souvenir
shop and the monster store,

44:29.639 --> 44:31.106
he's got two jobs.

44:31.108 --> 44:33.175
I don't even have
one anymore.

44:33.177 --> 44:34.876
What are you
talking about?

44:34.878 --> 44:36.644
Daphne's the leader.

44:36.646 --> 44:37.878
Shaggy's the pilot.

44:37.880 --> 44:40.414
Scooby digs up clues
and serves cold drinks.

44:40.416 --> 44:42.383
And you're
the resident skeptic.

44:42.385 --> 44:44.853
What do I do?
You saw me on that scooter.

44:44.855 --> 44:47.588
I... I can't even do
background hijinks right.

44:47.590 --> 44:49.324
Well, at least, you're honest.

44:49.326 --> 44:51.193
Unlike that salesman
back there.

44:51.195 --> 44:54.128
Selling the same stories about
things lurking in the dark

44:54.130 --> 44:55.731
trying to nab us.

44:55.733 --> 44:58.298
Let me tell you, if something
was trying to nab us,

44:58.300 --> 44:59.668
I'm pretty sure we'd...

45:00.871 --> 45:03.106
Velma? Velma?

45:08.344 --> 45:11.746
Like,
that was "snow" picnic.

45:11.748 --> 45:16.584
Why does
it smell like wet... Oh.

45:20.123 --> 45:21.856
Like, relax,
Scooby-Doo,

45:21.858 --> 45:23.958
we're still alive.

45:23.960 --> 45:27.028
Are you sure, Shaggy?

45:27.030 --> 45:30.565
Nope.

45:30.567 --> 45:33.101
How very lucky
the door gave way.

45:33.103 --> 45:34.536
We could've been crushed.

45:34.538 --> 45:36.570
We're completely
sealed in.

45:36.572 --> 45:39.541
And, dude, how are we
supposed to get out of here?

45:39.543 --> 45:42.443
I have an idea,
follow me and watch out.

45:42.445 --> 45:45.382
Places like this are always
filled with booby traps.

46:00.664 --> 46:03.498
I don't suppose
anyone has a rope?

46:03.500 --> 46:06.168
Looks like we have
to find another way out.

46:06.170 --> 46:10.304
Like, come on, Vincent. Don't you
have a spell that can make us fly?

46:10.306 --> 46:13.240
Oh, kids,
I'm so sorry, I...

46:13.242 --> 46:15.712
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

46:18.815 --> 46:22.083
So somebody left a candle burning.
Big deal.

46:22.085 --> 46:24.753
"Candle"? Who lit
that candle?

46:24.755 --> 46:26.454
I'll give you
three guesses.

46:26.456 --> 46:28.289
I'll give you one.

46:30.760 --> 46:31.929
Zoinks!

47:07.965 --> 47:09.200
What is it?

47:10.333 --> 47:11.965
It's the chest of demons.

47:11.967 --> 47:13.834
Like, Asmodeus has it.

47:15.338 --> 47:16.840
Ow, my hip.

47:18.474 --> 47:20.041
And he's getting away.

47:20.043 --> 47:22.209
No, he's not.

47:22.211 --> 47:24.847
Come on, gang!
I'm gonna miss this.

47:38.094 --> 47:39.496
Shh.

47:47.269 --> 47:51.104

49:42.286 --> 49:44.488
Hmm?

49:47.891 --> 49:50.126
Like, namaste.

49:52.661 --> 49:56.296
You're just in time for the
complimentary hour of guided meditation,

49:56.298 --> 49:57.634
brother.

49:58.967 --> 50:01.168
Let me relieve you
of your burden.

50:02.706 --> 50:05.740
Oh-ho! Okay, so you're
not yet ready to part

50:05.742 --> 50:09.476
with those earthly possessions.
No problemo.

50:09.478 --> 50:13.981
Don't mind Brother Scoobert, he's
observing the last year of a ten-year vow

50:13.983 --> 50:16.150
of silence.

50:16.152 --> 50:17.952
- I am?
- Well, he was.

50:17.954 --> 50:20.921
Better restart that clock,
buddy, old pal.

50:20.923 --> 50:24.492
All right, first you'll need to
pretzel your legs like a lotus.

50:24.494 --> 50:27.729
And no, I don't know what a lotus is.

50:27.731 --> 50:29.963
But who doesn't
love a good pretzel?

50:29.965 --> 50:32.835
Am I right?
Man, I love pretzels.

50:33.902 --> 50:35.269
Hmm.

50:41.911 --> 50:44.311
Now, you'll need to free
up your hands for this bit.

50:44.313 --> 50:48.215
So, Brother Scoobert,
if you wouldn't mind.

50:50.253 --> 50:55.289
Now, is that any way
to achieve inner peace?

50:55.291 --> 50:58.559
Speaking of peace,
it's time for your mantra.

51:00.996 --> 51:04.532
Om.

51:11.273 --> 51:17.614
Like... Om.

51:22.286 --> 51:24.619
Om, oh, my gosh.

51:24.621 --> 51:26.820
We haven't got you a robe!

51:26.822 --> 51:28.991
What are you,
a size six?

51:30.327 --> 51:31.858
Seven and a half.

51:31.860 --> 51:34.929
Seven?
Seven and three-quarters.

51:34.931 --> 51:38.199
- Thirteen!
- Thirteen? Zoinks!

51:38.201 --> 51:39.599
You're a big one, dude.

51:39.601 --> 51:43.105
Ahem, now slip your arms
through the sleeves.

51:49.179 --> 51:50.744
Namaste! Namaste!

51:50.746 --> 51:53.683
Namaste as far away
from you as possible-ay!

52:27.684 --> 52:29.751
Hmm? Ow, my tailbone.

52:29.753 --> 52:31.286
You got the chest!

52:31.288 --> 52:33.054
That would chain him, right?

52:33.056 --> 52:37.724
But the darkness is right on our
heels, if you know what I mean.

52:37.726 --> 52:39.492
We've got to get
out of here.

52:39.494 --> 52:41.028
Scooby, start digging.

52:41.030 --> 52:43.099
Yeah, you got it.

52:45.467 --> 52:47.800
Like, it's all iced over.

52:47.802 --> 52:52.039
What we need right now is a good
old-fashioned snow-melting spell.

52:52.041 --> 52:54.108
I've tried to tell you.

52:54.110 --> 52:57.478
Ever since Asmodeus showed up,
I haven't been able to cast

52:57.480 --> 52:59.246
a single successful spell.

52:59.248 --> 53:00.951
I'm having wizard's block.

53:01.918 --> 53:03.784
Give me that chest!

53:03.786 --> 53:07.189
You have to try, Vincent.
It's our only chance.

53:09.525 --> 53:15.061
Spirits of the Scorpio, reveal your power.
Let it flow into this realm

53:15.063 --> 53:19.869
with heated glow and melt
this blasted icy snow.

53:22.605 --> 53:25.106
What's wrong, old man?

53:25.108 --> 53:27.008
No powers?

53:27.010 --> 53:28.245
Power.

53:41.858 --> 53:45.028
What... What happened?

53:46.829 --> 53:48.329
Like, it worked.

53:48.331 --> 53:49.563
You got us out, Vincent.

53:49.565 --> 53:51.233
Vincent?

53:51.634 --> 53:52.969
Huh?

54:00.108 --> 54:02.844
- Vincent!
- <i>Daphne, you're safe.</i>

54:02.846 --> 54:04.211
<i>It worked.</i>

54:04.213 --> 54:05.479
How'd you do it?

54:05.481 --> 54:07.916
<i>If I told you how
the trick was done,</i>

54:07.918 --> 54:10.217
<i>it would no longer
be magic.</i>

54:10.219 --> 54:13.755
But if you destroyed your ball,
how are you broadcasting now?

54:13.757 --> 54:16.090
<i>I always carry
a spare.</i>

54:16.092 --> 54:18.325
<i>Listen, I don't have
much time.</i>

54:18.327 --> 54:20.494
<i>I'm just calling
to say goodbye.</i>

54:20.496 --> 54:21.896
Goodbye?

54:21.898 --> 54:24.664
<i>Yes, Scooby.
You kids need to run.</i>

54:24.666 --> 54:28.235
<i>This is between Asmodeus and me
now as it should always have been.</i>

54:28.237 --> 54:30.771
No, Vincent. We're a team.
We can't...

54:30.773 --> 54:33.874
<i>I must. I'm sorry I
brought you all into this.</i>

54:35.679 --> 54:38.179
<i>Do not fear.
I have the chest.</i>

54:38.181 --> 54:39.847
<i>For now.</i>

54:39.849 --> 54:42.316
<i>There's still time for you to get away.
Take the plane.</i>

54:42.318 --> 54:44.021
<i>Save yourselves!</i>

54:44.653 --> 54:46.387
Vincent!

54:46.389 --> 54:49.724
No. Vincent...

54:49.726 --> 54:52.025
What on earth?

54:52.027 --> 54:55.396
Hi, guys,
mind if we drop in?

54:57.099 --> 54:58.197
Hilarious.

54:58.199 --> 55:00.568
- What happened?
- Something...

55:00.570 --> 55:02.436
unexplainable.

55:02.438 --> 55:03.970
Like, where are your glasses?

55:03.972 --> 55:08.376
I don't need them.
I see everything clearly now.

55:08.378 --> 55:10.778
Yes, everything.

55:10.780 --> 55:14.817
I think Velma just had her
first real ghost encounter.

55:16.018 --> 55:18.287
I think
she's still having it.

55:19.054 --> 55:20.755
Say, where's Vincent?

55:20.757 --> 55:24.291
He's in the temple with Asmodeus
and the chest of demons.

55:24.293 --> 55:25.959
Well, then let's...

55:25.961 --> 55:27.961
No, Fred, it's over.

55:27.963 --> 55:29.863
The doors and windows
are frozen shut.

55:29.865 --> 55:33.333
By the time we make it in, the
chest will already be open.

55:33.335 --> 55:35.836
Maybe
the sheriff was right.

55:35.838 --> 55:37.070
We're out of our depth.

55:37.072 --> 55:39.541
Because of some frozen doors?

55:39.543 --> 55:42.709
Come on! We've fought
harder things than this.

55:42.711 --> 55:45.112
No. Daphne's
on to something.

55:45.114 --> 55:48.081
I mean, what's the point?
Ghosts exist.

55:48.083 --> 55:50.050
And they're about
to take over the Earth.

55:50.052 --> 55:51.818
There's nothing
we can do about it.

55:51.820 --> 55:56.023
Yeah, like, we're pretty good
against guys in rubber masks,

55:56.025 --> 55:58.492
but when the monsters
are real...

55:58.494 --> 56:00.228
We're just not equipped.

56:01.864 --> 56:04.365
Aw, Scooby, don't cry.

56:04.367 --> 56:06.633
Actually, Fred,
those are tears of joy.

56:06.635 --> 56:10.438
You took the Scooby Snacks with you and
we haven't seen you in, like, hours.

56:10.440 --> 56:14.541
It's true.
It's all true.

56:14.543 --> 56:16.644
Oh, Freddie.

56:16.646 --> 56:18.181
Ah!

56:21.485 --> 56:25.853
Like, boo? Boo-hoo?
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo?

56:25.855 --> 56:27.789
Just take 'em.

56:27.791 --> 56:30.557
Oh, uh, and here
are your keys.

56:31.860 --> 56:33.894
You keep them.

56:33.896 --> 56:37.266
I don't know what made me think I was cut
out to be a leader in the first place.

56:50.579 --> 56:53.916
Okay, that's it.
That is it!

56:55.652 --> 56:58.751
I've had enough of everybody
feeling sorry for themselves.

56:58.753 --> 57:00.954
So you're
a little hungry, right?

57:00.956 --> 57:02.257
Mmm-hmm.

57:02.259 --> 57:04.458
If you want your situation
to change,

57:04.460 --> 57:06.096
you have to take action.

57:10.567 --> 57:12.766
- Here.
- A snow burger?

57:12.768 --> 57:15.001
Like, wow.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.574
So you were wrong
about ghosts.

57:19.576 --> 57:22.108
They're real
and out to conquer the world.

57:22.110 --> 57:23.980
Are you just
gonna let them?

57:25.481 --> 57:27.449
No. No, I'm not.

57:28.985 --> 57:31.184
- As for you...
- Don't bother.

57:31.186 --> 57:35.255
Look at yourself right now, leading
your friends back from the cliff's edge.

57:35.257 --> 57:37.490
You were born for this.

57:37.492 --> 57:39.159
You're heroic, and kind,

57:39.161 --> 57:41.528
and above all, honest.

57:41.530 --> 57:44.365
Oh, really,
is that what you think?

57:44.367 --> 57:48.071
Well, then, it's time you
knew the truth, all of you.

57:49.806 --> 57:51.238
I lied!

57:51.240 --> 57:54.508
Last summer, I went
to cheerleading camp.

57:54.510 --> 57:56.809
Oh, that makes sense.

57:58.280 --> 58:00.648
You think I'm some
kind of leader, Daph?

58:00.650 --> 58:02.583
Well, you're
only half right.

58:02.585 --> 58:05.485
I'm a cheerleader.
I've been down in the dumps,

58:05.487 --> 58:08.255
because I thought
everyone had a job but me.

58:08.257 --> 58:11.023
But now I know
what my job is.

58:11.025 --> 58:13.094
What it's always been.

58:13.096 --> 58:15.628
I'm the one who believes
with all his heart

58:15.630 --> 58:17.299
in the rest of you.

58:18.768 --> 58:20.367
What is going on?

58:20.369 --> 58:22.568
Daphne Blake,
for goodness' sake,

58:22.570 --> 58:24.338
it's time for a decision.

58:24.340 --> 58:27.407
Hit the brake or undertake
a plan with great precision.

58:27.409 --> 58:31.211
Like, wow, his day
has really taken a turn.

58:31.213 --> 58:36.050
So, everybody,
rise and shine.

58:36.052 --> 58:38.186
Get on your feet
and get in line.

58:38.188 --> 58:40.521
Let's bust a move,
and bust a rhyme,

58:40.523 --> 58:44.724
and catch some ghosts.
It's busting time!

58:44.726 --> 58:47.427
What'll it be, Daph, are
you gonna rally your troops

58:47.429 --> 58:49.229
and take this demon
out to lunch?

58:49.231 --> 58:51.164
Or are we just going
to call it quits?

58:51.166 --> 58:52.432
Fred, I can't...

58:52.434 --> 58:55.235
Daph, you're the one
who drives stick.

58:55.237 --> 58:56.938
You're the one
with the plan,

58:56.940 --> 58:59.139
who always sees everything
from above,

58:59.141 --> 59:01.677
and knows exactly what
the next move should be.

59:03.045 --> 59:04.579
"From above."

59:04.581 --> 59:06.046
Okay, gang.

59:06.048 --> 59:08.282
We're going to the airport.

59:08.284 --> 59:10.387
Yay! Oh.

59:11.153 --> 59:12.688
This clutch.

59:13.688 --> 59:15.322
I can't...

59:15.324 --> 59:16.757
What are you looking for?

59:16.759 --> 59:18.159
My spare glasses.

59:18.161 --> 59:19.892
I'm pretty sure
I left a pair in the van.

59:19.894 --> 59:22.463
Oh, here they are.
Oh, yeah.

59:23.699 --> 59:25.633
This clutch! Every time!

59:25.635 --> 59:27.233
I can't...

59:27.235 --> 59:29.101
Get it to make...

59:29.103 --> 59:30.838
Oh, uh, that's
not the clutch.

59:30.840 --> 59:31.972
You mean, this is not the...

59:31.974 --> 59:33.508
It's the emergency brake.

59:33.510 --> 59:35.979
That pedal over there
is the clutch.

59:41.583 --> 59:43.117
Not a word about this
to Daphne.

59:43.119 --> 59:44.421
Uh-huh.

59:48.023 --> 59:50.057
Mmm-hmm. Mmm.

59:50.059 --> 59:52.392
You can really taste
the demons.

59:52.394 --> 59:53.463
Spicy.

59:54.731 --> 59:57.731
Ah-ha! I had a feeling
you'd be back.

59:57.733 --> 01:00:01.501
You know what? I was a lot happier
before I believed in ghosts.

01:00:01.503 --> 01:00:04.170
Oh, what changed
your mind?

01:00:04.172 --> 01:00:06.407
Doesn't matter.
What does matter

01:00:06.409 --> 01:00:08.108
is that right now,
up in that temple,

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:11.311
somebody's about to release 13
of the most terrifying ghosts

01:00:11.313 --> 01:00:13.115
upon the face of the Earth.

01:00:15.652 --> 01:00:18.452
So, we'll need
one of everything.

01:00:18.454 --> 01:00:20.987
Wow, okay, um...

01:00:20.989 --> 01:00:22.755
let me just
have your... Ah...

01:00:22.757 --> 01:00:25.858
Uh, no, right, of course,
time is of the essence

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.795
if you're gonna... Wait.

01:00:27.797 --> 01:00:30.463
Did you say "13 ghosts"?

01:00:30.465 --> 01:00:34.603
<i>Pshht, like,
we're 5,000 feet, open her up.</i>

01:00:40.275 --> 01:00:42.309
Like, the autopilot's
unavailable,

01:00:42.311 --> 01:00:43.644
'cause it's engaged.

01:00:43.646 --> 01:00:46.246
Little
cockpit humor for ya.

01:00:46.248 --> 01:00:48.414
But seriously,

01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:50.217
I don't think I can jump!

01:00:50.219 --> 01:00:52.084
That's okay.
I'm going to push you.

01:00:52.086 --> 01:00:54.623
- Oh?
- Like... No!

01:01:20.182 --> 01:01:21.550
They did it.

01:01:32.795 --> 01:01:35.496
Now let's hope they can
stall Asmodeus long enough

01:01:35.498 --> 01:01:37.597
for us to get there
with all this hunting gear.

01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:40.434
And stall Asmodeus long enough for us
to get there with all this hunting gear.

01:01:40.436 --> 01:01:43.170
- I just said that.
- Huh? Oh, sorry.

01:01:43.172 --> 01:01:45.005
I said,
"And stall Asmodeus

01:01:45.007 --> 01:01:47.407
"long enough for us to get there
with all this hunting gear."

01:01:47.409 --> 01:01:50.177
Forget it! And don't
touch anything back there.

01:01:50.179 --> 01:01:51.912
You think we really
should've brought him?

01:01:51.914 --> 01:01:54.847
He's the only one who knows
how to use all this crazy junk,

01:01:54.849 --> 01:01:56.383
so, yes.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.753
Looks like we've got a bogey
at 12 o'clock.

01:02:00.755 --> 01:02:01.790
How do you...

01:02:03.025 --> 01:02:04.724
This guy.

01:02:04.726 --> 01:02:07.360
- You know him?
- Not really a him,

01:02:07.362 --> 01:02:08.695
so much as an it.

01:02:08.697 --> 01:02:09.963
Here it comes.

01:02:09.965 --> 01:02:11.501
Everybody, hang on.

01:02:26.447 --> 01:02:28.282
- Don't look!
- I'm not!

01:02:28.284 --> 01:02:30.217
- Not you.
- Yak, Yak, Yak.

01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:32.786
- Who asked you?
- No! Look out!

01:02:32.788 --> 01:02:33.822
Yak!

01:02:38.327 --> 01:02:40.263
He's gaining on us.

01:02:49.804 --> 01:02:51.070
Go left! Go left!

01:02:51.072 --> 01:02:52.940
We can't drive on that.

01:02:52.942 --> 01:02:54.175
Trust me.

01:02:57.079 --> 01:02:58.681
Whoa!

01:03:08.757 --> 01:03:09.690
That was amazing.

01:03:09.692 --> 01:03:11.425
You ain't seen
nothing yet.

01:03:25.574 --> 01:03:27.844
And the piece
de resistance.

01:03:43.893 --> 01:03:45.626
Whoa, that was incredible.

01:03:45.628 --> 01:03:47.662
How'd you know
how to do all that?

01:03:47.664 --> 01:03:52.368
Well, it's not my first time in a
strategic altering mobile command unit.

01:03:58.173 --> 01:04:01.041
Now we just have to figure
out a way to get inside.

01:04:01.043 --> 01:04:02.778
Leave that to me.

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:09.552
Hmm.

01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:17.427
Oof!

01:04:18.527 --> 01:04:21.695
Scooby, did you take off
your parachute?

01:04:21.697 --> 01:04:23.499
Uh, yep.

01:04:30.106 --> 01:04:32.206
Uh, nope.

01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:34.575
- Scooby...
- Shh!

01:04:34.577 --> 01:04:36.376
Like, would you two
keep it down?

01:04:36.378 --> 01:04:40.146
I'm trying to hear what Vincent
and Asmodeus are talking about.

01:04:40.148 --> 01:04:42.081
Huh?

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:46.619
Then take it. Strike me down and
take it, if that's what you wish.

01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:48.255
I won't.

01:04:48.257 --> 01:04:51.458
That's right, because the chest
can only be opened by the living.

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.726
You need me.

01:04:52.728 --> 01:04:56.195
Nonsense! Now hand over
the chest!

01:04:56.197 --> 01:04:57.532
We have to do something.

01:05:07.708 --> 01:05:11.711
- Unbelievable!
- Yeah, this stuff melts anything.

01:05:11.713 --> 01:05:14.180
Come on.

01:05:14.182 --> 01:05:19.153
I would've thought all this
toying around was beneath you.

01:05:19.155 --> 01:05:23.257
Maybe the great king of demons
isn't quite the fierce monster

01:05:23.259 --> 01:05:24.659
we thought he was.

01:05:26.061 --> 01:05:27.961
Let us be done with this.

01:05:27.963 --> 01:05:31.465
I've lost everything to you
in this decades-old fight.

01:05:31.467 --> 01:05:33.666
Starting with my best friend.

01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:37.269
- If Mortifer were here...
- Well, he isn't, is he?

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:43.677
He's gone forever.

01:05:43.679 --> 01:05:46.545
And soon, you can join him.

01:05:48.351 --> 01:05:50.550
I am the 14th ghost.

01:05:53.456 --> 01:05:55.088
Oh, dear.

01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:57.090
There is no 14th ghost.

01:05:57.092 --> 01:06:00.894
Like,
that's what you think.

01:06:03.097 --> 01:06:05.199
No! Ahh!

01:06:09.005 --> 01:06:10.340
The chest.

01:06:13.909 --> 01:06:15.010
No!

01:06:19.213 --> 01:06:23.349
- Is that Asmodeus?
- Nope, but a ghost's a ghost.

01:06:23.351 --> 01:06:25.485
Huh? Hi.

01:06:25.487 --> 01:06:28.021
- It's doing something.
- Velma, now!

01:06:28.023 --> 01:06:29.521
Use the Vacuu-Spook.

01:06:29.523 --> 01:06:32.659
Huh? No, it's me!

01:06:32.661 --> 01:06:35.528
Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby?

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.630
Ha! Nice human pyramid.

01:06:37.632 --> 01:06:41.066
Did you say "Daphne,
Shaggy, Scooby"?

01:06:41.068 --> 01:06:42.403
Flim Flam?

01:06:42.405 --> 01:06:43.970
I thought your name
was Benny.

01:06:43.972 --> 01:06:47.708
Oh, no. Benny owns the shop.
I'm just the eye candy.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.344
Flim Flam, is it really you?

01:06:50.346 --> 01:06:52.278
Of course, it's me!

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.514
Like, dude,
you've grown up.

01:06:54.516 --> 01:06:55.782
Fast.

01:06:55.784 --> 01:06:57.851
I was long overdue
for a growth spurt.

01:06:57.853 --> 01:07:00.387
Daphne, your hair
is totally different.

01:07:00.389 --> 01:07:03.691
Shaggy, I've never seen you
wear a shirt that isn't red.

01:07:03.693 --> 01:07:06.226
- Hiyah!
- And Scooby-Doo,

01:07:06.228 --> 01:07:07.894
you haven't changed one bit.

01:07:07.896 --> 01:07:10.664
You know, I thought
that red van was familiar.

01:07:10.666 --> 01:07:12.699
Well, I guess the gang's
all here.

01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:14.036
Except Scrappy.

01:07:14.903 --> 01:07:15.901
What's a Scrappy?

01:07:15.903 --> 01:07:18.771
Come on,
we've gotta find Vincent.

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:20.574
Vincent's here, too?

01:07:20.576 --> 01:07:22.878
Was nobody gonna
pick up a phone?

01:07:29.518 --> 01:07:31.584
Vincent!

01:07:31.586 --> 01:07:34.720
Flim Flam? Oh, this is quite
a reunion.

01:07:34.722 --> 01:07:38.258
But I'm afraid it's too late!
The world is doomed,

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.193
and it's all my fault.

01:07:40.195 --> 01:07:43.162
That's crazy! We've all
fought the 13 ghosts.

01:07:43.164 --> 01:07:45.664
If it really is the end,
we're all responsible.

01:07:45.666 --> 01:07:51.037
No, you don't understand. The portrait
hanging in my family's castle.

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:54.273
It isn't of me
but my ancestor.

01:07:54.275 --> 01:07:57.344
<i>The first to bear
the name Van Ghoul.</i>

01:07:57.346 --> 01:08:00.880
<i>He was the most powerful sorcerer
the world has ever known.</i>

01:08:00.882 --> 01:08:02.916
<i>But power corrupts.</i>

01:08:02.918 --> 01:08:07.454
<i>Little by little, he used his
magic to twist the will of man</i>

01:08:07.456 --> 01:08:09.322
<i>into his service.</i>

01:08:09.324 --> 01:08:12.760
<i>But the powers of good
conspired to relieve my ancestor</i>

01:08:12.762 --> 01:08:14.795
<i>of his self-appointed throne.</i>

01:08:14.797 --> 01:08:17.697
<i>He was defeated,
stripped of his mortality,</i>

01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:21.667
<i>trapped in a specially-crafted
inescapable prison.</i>

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:26.540
<i>Where, unfortunately, he had nothing
but to wait and grow his already</i>

01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:28.075
<i>substantial powers.</i>

01:08:28.077 --> 01:08:32.411
<i>In life, he was called
Asamad Van Ghoul.</i>

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:34.380
<i>But now he goes by...</i>

01:08:34.381 --> 01:08:35.816
Asmodeus.

01:08:35.818 --> 01:08:37.716
I'm the last of
the Van Ghouls.

01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:43.188
And as such, the crimes of my
ancestor are my responsibility

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:44.657
and mine alone.

01:08:44.658 --> 01:08:46.460
I'm sorry I never told you.

01:08:46.462 --> 01:08:47.660
Old fool!

01:08:47.662 --> 01:08:49.562
It's finished!

01:08:49.564 --> 01:08:51.867
The chest is mine!

01:08:58.273 --> 01:08:59.939
Ugh! Oh!

01:08:59.942 --> 01:09:02.975
He's releasing the ghosts!
We're too late.

01:09:02.978 --> 01:09:05.478
What kind of attitude
is that?

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.580
Ah...

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:10.116
<i>♪ We've got spirits
Yes, we do</i>

01:09:10.118 --> 01:09:14.554
<i>♪ We've got spirits
How about y... ♪</i>

01:09:14.555 --> 01:09:16.589
You know what?
Bad timing.

01:09:19.362 --> 01:09:20.626
Velma, now!

01:09:20.627 --> 01:09:22.728
Use the Vacuu-Spook!

01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:29.502
No.

01:09:29.505 --> 01:09:31.073
What are you doing?

01:09:32.173 --> 01:09:35.041
Mr. Van Ghoul,
something's bothering me.

01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:36.710
Is it the smell?

01:09:36.712 --> 01:09:40.613
In the last day, I've seen everything
I believed turned upside down.

01:09:40.615 --> 01:09:42.649
Ghosts and demons
were real.

01:09:42.652 --> 01:09:45.384
So I decided to play
by that set of rules.

01:09:45.386 --> 01:09:48.854
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that rules are rules.

01:09:48.856 --> 01:09:50.723
And the first rule
of the chest of demons

01:09:50.725 --> 01:09:52.893
is that it can only be opened
by the living.

01:09:52.895 --> 01:09:54.597
Why, that's right!

01:09:55.963 --> 01:09:58.967
Yes, it is.

01:10:00.569 --> 01:10:05.106
I think it's time we see who
this king of demons really is.

01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:11.581
No!

01:10:19.854 --> 01:10:23.259
It... It can't be.
I saw you die.

01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:33.665
You saw an illusion.

01:10:33.667 --> 01:10:36.102
I was always good
with illusions.

01:10:36.104 --> 01:10:38.839
The magician
that tricked the wizard.

01:10:38.841 --> 01:10:42.409
- But why?
- I wanted the chest, Vincent.

01:10:42.411 --> 01:10:44.111
But you wouldn't
let it go.

01:10:44.113 --> 01:10:46.647
You thought
it called to you.

01:10:46.649 --> 01:10:49.215
You never saw
for what it really is.

01:10:49.217 --> 01:10:50.817
An artifact.

01:10:50.819 --> 01:10:54.153
Ancient, beautiful,
and priceless.

01:10:54.155 --> 01:10:57.424
Priceless? Then how'd
you come up with 10 million?

01:10:57.426 --> 01:11:00.193
That's your asking number,
isn't it, Quinch?

01:11:00.195 --> 01:11:01.628
Bernie Alan?

01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:03.495
Boy, are you a bad penny.

01:11:03.497 --> 01:11:05.065
More like a bad check.

01:11:05.067 --> 01:11:08.402
"Bernie Alan"?
Ha, I think not.

01:11:08.404 --> 01:11:09.968
Vance Linklater.

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:14.474
Undercover Interpol detective
and amateur figure skater.

01:11:14.476 --> 01:11:16.211
Swarm, boys.

01:11:20.082 --> 01:11:23.549
We've been tracking old
Quinchie here for months

01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:27.085
ever since he began reaching out to
the world's wealthiest collectors

01:11:27.087 --> 01:11:30.723
about selling them the
legendary chest of demons.

01:11:30.725 --> 01:11:34.393
But the trail went cold
after your garage sale, kids.

01:11:34.395 --> 01:11:36.196
So, lucky I was in town

01:11:36.198 --> 01:11:39.432
for the upper Himalayas Men's
Interpretive Semi-finals.

01:11:39.434 --> 01:11:43.269
Like, if you're a cop, then, like,
why did you run away from us?

01:11:43.271 --> 01:11:44.937
I'm afraid of teenagers.

01:11:44.939 --> 01:11:48.208
So it was only about profiting
off the sale of an ancient relic.

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:50.977
It was never about
releasing the 13 ghosts.

01:11:50.979 --> 01:11:53.079
Like, speaking of which,
where are they?

01:11:53.081 --> 01:11:55.115
What was with
all that vapor?

01:11:56.618 --> 01:11:59.218
Yech, old sandwich.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.053
Oh, man!

01:12:01.055 --> 01:12:04.590
- What is it, Shaggy?
- I think I shipped Vincent the wrong chest of demons.

01:12:04.592 --> 01:12:07.994
This... This one's the cooler
I bought off Flim Flam.

01:12:07.996 --> 01:12:09.629
Told you I sold one.

01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:12.298
That still doesn't explain
the lights and screaming mist.

01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:17.236
That's just part of the premium,
total-immersion package.

01:12:17.238 --> 01:12:19.539
Well, you kids
have been a great help.

01:12:19.541 --> 01:12:22.675
You should think about
solving mysteries full-time.

01:12:22.677 --> 01:12:25.611
Wait a second.
We're not done here.

01:12:25.613 --> 01:12:27.148
Oh, yeah.

01:12:29.051 --> 01:12:33.187
Huh? I would've gotten
away with it...

01:12:34.256 --> 01:12:36.822
...if it weren't
for you meddling kids?

01:12:38.193 --> 01:12:41.027
- That's better.
- I'm sorry, old friend.

01:12:41.029 --> 01:12:43.229
For impersonating
my ancestor?

01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:45.165
And for this.

01:12:47.167 --> 01:12:49.037
That's my ride.

01:12:50.104 --> 01:12:52.073
Don't look so shocked.

01:12:54.475 --> 01:12:57.611
- We've gotta stop him.
- Oh, just let him go.

01:12:57.613 --> 01:13:01.647
No, that car's engine, if he
keeps running it like that...

01:13:01.649 --> 01:13:03.485
The avalanche! You're right!

01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:17.863
Mortifer, you must listen.
The engine...

01:13:17.865 --> 01:13:19.633
Sounds fine to me.

01:13:22.037 --> 01:13:24.236
So long, Vincent!

01:13:31.078 --> 01:13:33.481
Mortifer, you fool! Stop!

01:13:44.192 --> 01:13:45.625
No!

01:13:53.969 --> 01:13:55.570
Asamad.

01:14:00.475 --> 01:14:01.473
He's at peace.

01:14:01.475 --> 01:14:04.076
Asamad Van Ghoul
can finally rest.

01:14:04.078 --> 01:14:05.879
I... I don't understand.

01:14:05.881 --> 01:14:09.482
Well, it might have something
to do with this translation.

01:14:09.484 --> 01:14:12.885
"Asmodeus will not rest

01:14:12.887 --> 01:14:15.522
"until he achieves
his revenge."

01:14:15.524 --> 01:14:22.061
Only the ancient Sanskrit word for "revenge"
looks a lot like the word for "redemption."

01:14:22.063 --> 01:14:24.397
Asamad Van Ghoul
had a lot of time

01:14:24.399 --> 01:14:27.299
and a chest of demons
to consider his misdeeds.

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:29.000
He wasn't looking
for vengeance.

01:14:29.002 --> 01:14:30.503
He wanted to be redeemed.

01:14:30.505 --> 01:14:34.040
If I had to guess,
I'd say the 13th ghost,

01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:38.044
your ancestor, was watching out
for you like a guardian angel.

01:14:38.046 --> 01:14:41.113
And now that you're safe,
he can finally rest.

01:14:41.115 --> 01:14:44.585
Yes, that's right.
I'm sure it is.

01:14:44.587 --> 01:14:47.754
Like, are you guys nuts? That
was just a big glob of...

01:14:47.756 --> 01:14:49.255
Ow!

01:14:49.257 --> 01:14:51.590
I'm sorry about your friend.

01:14:57.998 --> 01:14:59.531
Huh?

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:04.536
It's all right.

01:15:04.538 --> 01:15:06.505
I can always visit him

01:15:06.507 --> 01:15:07.973
in the ghoul-ag.

01:15:16.051 --> 01:15:18.020
He's gonna be fine.

01:15:21.655 --> 01:15:24.924
See, Daph, you got this
leadership thing in the bag.

01:15:24.926 --> 01:15:27.626
All you needed was
a little encouragement.

01:15:27.628 --> 01:15:31.231
A cheering section!

01:15:31.233 --> 01:15:33.833
You're not about to whip
out the pom-poms, are you?

01:15:33.835 --> 01:15:35.201
I mean it.

01:15:35.203 --> 01:15:37.003
I'm sorry if I never
saw it before, Daph,

01:15:37.005 --> 01:15:40.205
but you're the engine that
makes this whole team run.

01:15:40.207 --> 01:15:42.842
Aw, I may be the engine,

01:15:42.844 --> 01:15:45.213
but you'll always
be the driver.

01:15:48.182 --> 01:15:50.049
You think that, uh,

01:15:50.051 --> 01:15:52.852
Captain Rogers
will let me fly the plane?

01:15:52.854 --> 01:15:56.656
As long as you stay
away from the emergency brake.

01:15:56.658 --> 01:15:58.525
Velma!

01:15:58.527 --> 01:16:02.528
- So, after all that...
- Indeed, my healthy skepticism is back.

01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:03.996
Hopefully for good.

01:16:03.998 --> 01:16:06.666
What about all that stuff you
said about Asamad Van Ghoul?

01:16:06.668 --> 01:16:10.135
Those stories have been central
to Vincent's entire life.

01:16:10.137 --> 01:16:12.272
I didn't wanna take that
away from him.

01:16:12.274 --> 01:16:13.772
So you made it up.

01:16:13.774 --> 01:16:17.076
Okay, fine, the 13th ghost
turned out to be fake.

01:16:17.078 --> 01:16:18.811
But what about
the first 12?

01:16:18.813 --> 01:16:22.281
Mass hallucinations from
high-altitude oxygen deprivation.

01:16:22.283 --> 01:16:24.418
I mean,
it is the Himalayas.

01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:27.119
Okay, but what about
your close encounter?

01:16:27.121 --> 01:16:30.156
Yeah, what do you think grabbed
us and flew us up that mountain?

01:16:30.158 --> 01:16:33.826
I'm glad you asked. It was
dark and I lost my glasses.

01:16:33.828 --> 01:16:35.495
And?

01:16:35.497 --> 01:16:36.699
Ski lift.

01:16:38.132 --> 01:16:39.633
- Oh, give me a break.
- Oh, come on.

01:16:39.635 --> 01:16:42.235
Clearly, we wandered
into the path of a ski lift,

01:16:42.237 --> 01:16:44.004
and our clothes
got caught.

01:16:44.006 --> 01:16:46.873
I could pull up a dozen
articles about similar incidents

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:49.909
on my phone
right now.

01:16:49.911 --> 01:16:54.714
Okay, fine, I'll prove to you
that ghosts are just stories.

01:16:54.716 --> 01:16:57.851
The real chest of demons.

01:16:57.853 --> 01:17:00.586
Can you believe it was in
the van with Shaggy's luggage

01:17:00.588 --> 01:17:02.056
the entire time?

01:17:03.425 --> 01:17:05.558
- What are you doing?
- Are you nuts?

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.130
Yeah, Velma, I mean,
what if you're wrong?

01:17:11.032 --> 01:17:13.202
Ugh, fine.

01:17:14.002 --> 01:17:16.138
- What?
- Nothing.

01:17:18.238 --> 01:17:22.310
Oh, hey, Shaggy, here's
that case you asked for.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.013
Lotsa Luck
Joy Juice.

01:17:27.015 --> 01:17:30.518
Aw, Flim Flam,
I remember this stuff.

01:17:33.121 --> 01:17:34.720
Told you
it could melt anything.

01:17:34.722 --> 01:17:37.357
Like, are you sure
you don't wanna join us

01:17:37.359 --> 01:17:40.226
on our trans-haunt-tlantic
flight?

01:17:43.264 --> 01:17:45.798
Nah, somebody's
gotta stick around

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.468
and tell the tourists
the tale of Asmodeus.

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:51.670
The demon king who
almost ruled the world.

01:17:51.672 --> 01:17:55.541
And make a tiny profit off
the merchandising, I suspect.

01:17:55.543 --> 01:17:59.845
Don't worry, Vince, I'll leave
old Mortifer's name out of it.

01:17:59.847 --> 01:18:03.148
Thank you, Flim Flam. I'll
see you when I'm in town

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:05.050
for my coven's
next meeting.

01:18:05.052 --> 01:18:07.887
Bye.

01:18:07.889 --> 01:18:12.858
And for ghoulness sake, Flim
Flam, please, stay out of trouble.

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.826
No promises, Vinnie.

01:18:14.828 --> 01:18:17.465
That's my boy.

01:18:24.439 --> 01:18:25.838
Bye!

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.077
So long, sports fans.

01:18:30.311 --> 01:18:31.878
Everything okay?

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.914
Yeah, just thinking about
our impending retirement.

01:18:34.916 --> 01:18:39.785
Well, as my last official act
as leader, I'm calling it off.

01:18:39.787 --> 01:18:42.821
- Huh?
- This is what we do best, Freddie.

01:18:42.823 --> 01:18:46.459
I'm not ready to give it up, just
because we made one tiny mistake.

01:18:46.461 --> 01:18:48.727
And by the way,
I'm still not convinced

01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:51.330
old Farmer Morgan
was totally innocent.

01:18:51.332 --> 01:18:53.098
I agree! First off,

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:56.635
the guy's boot prints were all
over the ghost's secret lair.

01:18:56.637 --> 01:18:59.071
- Second...
- Imitation yak jerky?

01:18:59.073 --> 01:19:01.374
Imitation yak jerky,
anyone?

01:19:01.376 --> 01:19:04.110
Hang on a second.
Shaggy, if you're back here,

01:19:04.112 --> 01:19:05.713
who's flying the plane?

01:19:09.317 --> 01:19:13.687
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
