01:33.652 --> 01:34.921
Dylan: Anyway, can I just finish this story?

01:34.921 --> 01:35.754
Anyway--
In high school.

01:35.754 --> 01:36.587
Carl: It was a silly danger to you.

01:36.587 --> 01:37.420
Dylan: Can I just finish this story?

01:37.420 --> 01:38.253
Dylan: In fact, it was a major danger to you.

01:38.253 --> 01:39.624
Can I just finish this story, please?

01:39.624 --> 01:40.520
Yes.
No.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.167
(rock music)

01:43.167 --> 01:44.968
Okay, so it was nice, right?

01:44.968 --> 01:46.178
And we'd been waiting all day.

01:46.178 --> 01:47.578
Yeah, in a toilet, right?

01:47.578 --> 01:50.069
Who makes you wait in a toilet for an entire day?

01:50.069 --> 01:51.440
Well, it was wait in the toilet or wait

01:51.440 --> 01:52.389
in the cleaner's closet.

01:52.389 --> 01:54.025
Oh, I don't like the smell of ammonia.

01:54.025 --> 01:54.858
I can't wait in the closet.

01:54.858 --> 01:56.701
Hey, doesn't sperm smell like ammonia?

01:56.701 --> 01:58.062
That actually smells a little bit more metallic.

01:58.062 --> 01:58.895
But anyway--

01:58.895 --> 02:00.225
Please, guys, please.

02:00.225 --> 02:01.715
So, it's dark, right?

02:01.715 --> 02:03.083
The last of the students leave,

02:03.083 --> 02:05.156
and we creep out into the corridor

02:05.156 --> 02:07.616
and he's all like blah blah blah blah,

02:07.616 --> 02:08.757
moaning about something.

02:08.757 --> 02:10.416
I was actually just pointing out

02:10.416 --> 02:11.249
the illegality of the situation.

02:11.249 --> 02:12.082
Well you'd be pointing at no--

02:12.082 --> 02:12.915
Well because if we get busted--

02:12.915 --> 02:13.748
You're like an old married couple.

02:13.748 --> 02:15.849
The illegality of the situation all day.

02:15.849 --> 02:17.132
Kiss and make up.

02:17.132 --> 02:20.129
Anyway, we're going down the corridor, we get to

02:20.129 --> 02:22.231
the staff rooms.

02:22.231 --> 02:23.591
There's all these pictures up on the walls of like

02:23.591 --> 02:26.513
trees and shrubs and complete shit.

02:26.513 --> 02:27.423
No not shit.

02:27.423 --> 02:29.801
Come on mate, it was all misty, Vaseline,

02:29.801 --> 02:31.505
turn of the century type crap.

02:31.505 --> 02:32.681
Uh, is this all going somewhere?

02:32.681 --> 02:34.443
So basically we walk in there

02:34.443 --> 02:36.819
and there's all these pictures right on the walls

02:36.819 --> 02:38.822
and there's one that stands out above the rest.

02:38.822 --> 02:39.655
Yeah.

02:39.655 --> 02:40.488
It's the picture of the Wollemia Pine.

02:40.488 --> 02:42.286
Yeah, so there's this picture, right?

02:42.286 --> 02:43.962
Hey, hey seriously, I love this tree like.

02:43.962 --> 02:45.369
He's been going on about this tree

02:45.369 --> 02:47.066
since he could masturbate.
(giggling)

02:47.066 --> 02:48.825
Basically so he was like, no, before that.

02:48.825 --> 02:49.860
Since he was like 12.

02:49.860 --> 02:52.085
Seriously, this guy, this thieving bastard

02:52.085 --> 02:54.376
just rips it off the wall--
Yeah, thieving bastard.

02:54.376 --> 02:57.121
And then turns it over and on the back is...

02:57.121 --> 02:58.860
Oh, bad boys!

02:58.860 --> 03:01.814
Now property of Carl Racen.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.793
That's the map to the Wollemia Pine.

03:03.793 --> 03:07.293
We're gonna find you that tree, brother.

04:15.156 --> 04:17.180
You wanna keep this a secret?

04:17.180 --> 04:18.348
It's a secret.

04:21.141 --> 04:23.683
Are you gonna fuck him when you're out there?

04:23.683 --> 04:25.016
Oh, of course.

04:29.043 --> 04:30.376

(shouts)

04:35.960 --> 04:37.960
You gonna go for Carl?

04:38.859 --> 04:39.923
He's a bit short.

04:39.923 --> 04:41.256
Mm, but smart.

04:46.639 --> 04:47.472
Zac.

04:48.858 --> 04:50.441
Got a joke for you.

04:51.798 --> 04:53.631
Why are pirates angry?

04:55.144 --> 04:56.323
Come on, you work on boats.

04:56.323 --> 04:58.156
Why are pirates angry?

04:59.960 --> 05:01.460
Because they arrr.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.504
Sorry we're late mate it's just traffic, you know.

05:18.504 --> 05:22.671
Easter, everyone heading up to the Blue Mountains.

05:26.255 --> 05:27.088
Hey.

05:28.011 --> 05:30.032
You drop me off at Mount Victoria?

05:30.032 --> 05:32.168
My car broke down last weekend.

05:32.168 --> 05:34.352
(rock music)

05:34.352 --> 05:35.185
WIG760.

05:36.832 --> 05:37.749
WIG, WIG.

05:40.011 --> 05:41.254
Wet itchy groin.

05:41.254 --> 05:42.272
Good.

05:42.272 --> 05:43.974
Toni: Does it have to be dirty?

05:43.974 --> 05:44.971
Like?

05:44.971 --> 05:46.471
Like who is God?

05:47.712 --> 05:48.854
No, it's gotta be filthy.

05:48.854 --> 05:50.134
(laughing)

05:50.134 --> 05:54.214
It's gotta be filthy like worm-infested gonads.

05:54.214 --> 05:55.131
Ew.
Ugh.

05:57.113 --> 05:58.534
Come on mate.

05:58.534 --> 06:01.534
It's Good Friday, it's good fun day.

06:02.432 --> 06:03.734
If he starts snoring I'm just gonna push him

06:03.734 --> 06:05.654
out of the car, alright?

06:05.654 --> 06:06.651
What could I say?

06:06.651 --> 06:08.134
SYP360.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.531
Shrinking yellow penis.

06:09.531 --> 06:11.552
Pippa: Slimy yelping puppies?

06:11.552 --> 06:13.493
Dylan: That's embarrassing.

06:13.493 --> 06:16.475
Okay then, suck your prick.

06:16.475 --> 06:17.752
Dylan: That kinda works.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.002
(laughing)

06:21.232 --> 06:23.152
You have to be really careful with disease.

06:23.152 --> 06:25.310
If one tree gets sick, they'll all get sick.

06:25.310 --> 06:28.595
That's why I brought disinfectant and rubber gloves.

06:28.595 --> 06:30.336
Oh, hello.

06:30.336 --> 06:32.132
This isn't about tree hunting.

06:32.132 --> 06:34.052
You guys just wanna shag the tree, right?

06:34.052 --> 06:36.560
Hello, tree shagging's not a crime.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.798
As long as it's true love between man and wood.

06:39.798 --> 06:42.240
Actually crime's normal in my books.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.600
You know Emile Durkheim?

06:43.600 --> 06:44.598
Is that that cool French--

06:44.598 --> 06:45.638
Sociologist, yeah.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.320
Well Durkheim says and I'm paraphrasing here but he says--

06:48.320 --> 06:49.153
(car hood slams)

06:49.153 --> 06:50.986
Crime is normal and...

06:53.330 --> 06:55.793
She's gone, rooted.

06:55.793 --> 06:56.896
She's cracked the head.

06:56.896 --> 06:57.729
Shit.

06:58.837 --> 07:01.179
Do you know what cracked the head means?

07:01.179 --> 07:02.496
No, not really.

07:02.496 --> 07:05.555
I can't get out of here til Tuesday.

07:05.555 --> 07:06.805
Fucking Easter!

07:08.076 --> 07:09.993
You finished with that?

07:19.797 --> 07:21.509
So what are you gonna do, Zac?

07:21.509 --> 07:23.312
You could come along with us if you want?

07:23.312 --> 07:24.145
Yeah Carl?

07:28.891 --> 07:31.053
Oh hey ah, you know what we're out there

07:31.053 --> 07:32.517
til Monday afternoon, you gotta work Monday

07:32.517 --> 07:34.100
so that won't work.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.643
A stupid suggestion.

07:38.365 --> 07:39.262
(sighs)

07:39.262 --> 07:40.095
You all good?

07:40.095 --> 07:41.250
I don't think this is all gonna fit.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.917
Can I put some in yours?

07:42.917 --> 07:46.000
Pippa: Carry your own accessories.

07:51.157 --> 07:52.907
Grab your uniforms.

07:55.055 --> 07:57.493
Celebration of life tour.

07:57.493 --> 07:58.326
CLT.

07:59.797 --> 08:00.630
Here.

08:03.032 --> 08:06.152
The Bluff, Stepping Cascade, Firefly Gully,

08:06.152 --> 08:09.455
Water Canyon, Wollemia Nobilis.

08:09.455 --> 08:11.622
That's Wollemia Nobilis.

08:12.597 --> 08:13.597
I love it.

08:14.913 --> 08:16.735
Nice one, chief.

08:16.735 --> 08:19.235
(light music)

08:55.359 --> 08:58.026
(phone ringing)

09:10.138 --> 09:10.971
My mum.

09:15.375 --> 09:16.377
(beeps)

09:16.377 --> 09:18.319
Mrs. Racen, hi.

09:18.319 --> 09:19.818
Carl: You alright?

09:19.818 --> 09:22.677
Dylan: Well, we'll probably be out of range

09:22.677 --> 09:24.760
but I can take a message.

09:34.757 --> 09:36.840
I really like Cashmere.

09:37.775 --> 09:41.942
I prefer cotton, I get itchy with anything else.

09:43.413 --> 09:45.455
It's a Zeppelin song.

09:45.455 --> 09:47.038
Right, of course.

09:49.314 --> 09:51.897
(gentle music)

10:19.793 --> 10:20.626
Oh wow.

10:52.264 --> 10:53.839
See?

10:53.839 --> 10:56.831
I am a useful human being.

10:56.831 --> 10:57.664
So am I.

11:01.841 --> 11:04.758
(mimicking chimps)

11:12.814 --> 11:14.451
Hey.

11:14.451 --> 11:15.831
Toni never shuts up about you,

11:15.831 --> 11:17.152
you should have a crack at her.

11:17.152 --> 11:18.345
Would you shut up?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.347
Are you gay?

11:19.347 --> 11:21.251
Green chicken curry.

11:21.251 --> 11:23.673
Carl, you know I don't eat meat.

11:23.673 --> 11:25.534
I got you tofu.

11:25.534 --> 11:27.513
And you can cook it in a different pot.

11:27.513 --> 11:28.346
No.

11:29.411 --> 11:30.990
No.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.310
I'll cook yours first.

11:33.310 --> 11:34.143
Okay.

11:42.425 --> 11:43.842
Mm, yes please.

11:48.545 --> 11:51.331
Hey, Zachary daiquiri!

11:51.331 --> 11:52.414
Come join us!

11:55.731 --> 11:58.648
(mimicking chimps)

12:03.970 --> 12:07.303
(acoustic guitar music)

12:13.151 --> 12:14.491
It was delicious.

12:14.491 --> 12:16.094
I'm completely stuffed.

12:16.094 --> 12:18.754
Yeah, it was excellent.

12:18.754 --> 12:19.754
Thanks mate.

12:22.451 --> 12:25.118
I actually got a cramp, sorry.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.787
(laughing)

12:35.534 --> 12:37.784
Yeah, the man has talent.

12:40.595 --> 12:44.295
Oh, did you like it, Zachary daiquiri?

12:44.295 --> 12:45.690
I only brought enough for four.

12:45.690 --> 12:47.933
Don't be a knob.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.016
(laughs)

12:57.766 --> 12:58.883
No, no.

12:58.883 --> 13:00.302
Don't touch it.
Why?

13:00.302 --> 13:03.065
Puts it out of tune.
Oh, really?

13:03.065 --> 13:04.702
Oh, what's that?

13:04.702 --> 13:05.806
This?

13:05.806 --> 13:08.223
Yeah, it's a little GI Joe.

13:10.284 --> 13:12.563
It belonged to Carl's brother.

13:12.563 --> 13:13.396
Luke.

13:14.665 --> 13:16.838
Yeah so why do you have it?

13:16.838 --> 13:18.363
'Cause he was a friend of mine.

13:18.363 --> 13:19.196
Mm.

13:20.226 --> 13:21.809
And--
He's dead.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.306
I'm sorry Carl.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.927
No, it's okay.

13:27.927 --> 13:30.226
Happened a long time ago.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.226
Eight years.

13:36.887 --> 13:38.720
What happened, Carl?

13:41.725 --> 13:44.407
Luke got hit by a car.

13:44.407 --> 13:47.542
He was out riding his bike one afternoon.

13:47.542 --> 13:50.542
Was Easter Saturday, late afternoon.

13:51.927 --> 13:54.177
Were you guys there?
No.

13:56.019 --> 13:58.519
No, he was alone when he died.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.727
He was a little speed freak.

14:02.727 --> 14:05.207
Carl was always trying to make him go slow

14:05.207 --> 14:08.040
but he always wanted to go faster.

14:09.046 --> 14:10.988
He always wanted to go as fast as us, didn't he mate?

14:10.988 --> 14:11.821
As fast as me.

14:11.821 --> 14:13.968
(laughs)

14:13.968 --> 14:16.048
Yeah, he had a sweet bike, didn't he?

14:16.048 --> 14:18.309
Like this BMX with spring shockies, he had the whole--

14:18.309 --> 14:20.811
Spare us the detail!
Alright, give me some love.

14:20.811 --> 14:22.587
Come here, give me some love.

14:22.587 --> 14:24.087
Give me some love!

14:25.614 --> 14:27.281
Oh he's got a woody!

14:28.382 --> 14:30.155
See this is what happens, every time we hug

14:30.155 --> 14:31.822
he wants to fuck me!

14:32.774 --> 14:34.513
Get your dick out of my ass!

14:34.513 --> 14:36.636
Fuck off!
(laughing)

14:36.636 --> 14:39.654
You know, I reckon, wrestling, sport,

14:39.654 --> 14:43.585
it's just another excuse for men to touch each other.

14:43.585 --> 14:44.418
Dylan: You're weak!

14:44.418 --> 14:47.168
(peaceful music)

14:57.508 --> 14:59.758
(laughing)

15:20.852 --> 15:23.008
That's a big drop.

15:23.008 --> 15:24.772
Why don't we find an easier way down?

15:24.772 --> 15:26.671
This is the quickest way.

15:26.671 --> 15:28.329
How do we get back up?

15:28.329 --> 15:32.329
Uh, there's a gully out not far from the tree.

15:37.669 --> 15:39.039
Let's do it.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.539
(light music)

15:51.022 --> 15:51.855
Woohoo!

15:55.680 --> 15:56.513
Woo!

16:01.739 --> 16:02.572
Woohoo!

16:05.297 --> 16:07.880
Does my bum look big in this?

16:27.709 --> 16:29.558
Dylan: You're doing good.

16:29.558 --> 16:30.391
You good?

16:32.939 --> 16:33.772
Okay.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.549
Look at that, you're a pro.

16:43.267 --> 16:46.767
Zac: So where's this gully back up top?

16:50.033 --> 16:52.369
It's just here, near the tree.

16:52.369 --> 16:53.452
See, not far.

16:55.288 --> 16:57.249
If that's the gully

16:57.249 --> 16:59.393
then why didn't we climb in there by the tree?

16:59.393 --> 17:00.710
Would have been easier.

17:00.710 --> 17:04.292
Well everyone's already down there, mate.

17:05.132 --> 17:07.190
How many days is this trip?

17:07.190 --> 17:11.107
It's four, it's two days in and two days out.

17:13.473 --> 17:16.193
So that means we find this tree this afternoon.

17:16.193 --> 17:17.852
Here's hoping.

17:17.852 --> 17:20.330
Here's hoping.
Yeah.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.969
Here's hoping.

17:21.969 --> 17:23.719
You done this before?

17:26.973 --> 17:28.973
You got a favorite song?

17:30.329 --> 17:31.868
Sing it for me on the way down.

17:31.868 --> 17:34.285
Takes your mind off the drop.

17:37.332 --> 17:39.832
(light music)

17:40.691 --> 17:42.191
Come on Zac, sing!

17:48.485 --> 17:49.318
Sing!

17:51.211 --> 17:53.461
(laughing)

18:00.670 --> 18:02.753
This man can really sing.

18:06.209 --> 18:07.042
Rope.

18:41.597 --> 18:43.605
Carl: How far to the Stepping Cascade, chief?

18:43.605 --> 18:46.105
Dunno.
Maybe check the map.

18:47.450 --> 18:49.183
It's spooky down here.

18:49.183 --> 18:51.322
I'm so sleeping on the uphill side tonight.

18:51.322 --> 18:52.155
Is that the one of my bum?

18:52.155 --> 18:53.238
Pippa!
No?

18:54.251 --> 18:55.084
Fuck.

18:57.412 --> 18:59.308
I forgot the map.

18:59.308 --> 19:01.345
Toni: You what?

19:01.345 --> 19:04.065
I left the map at the top of the cliff.

19:04.065 --> 19:07.964
I was helping Zac, I put the map down...

19:07.964 --> 19:10.162
Well just climb back up and get it.

19:10.162 --> 19:12.362
We can't, we need climbing gear to get up there.

19:12.362 --> 19:13.627
We don't have--

19:13.627 --> 19:15.265
No we don't have any climbing gear.

19:15.265 --> 19:17.182
So how do we get out?

19:18.577 --> 19:20.279
The map was only a loose guide.

19:20.279 --> 19:21.857
No, Dylan.

19:21.857 --> 19:23.297
It was the guide.

19:23.297 --> 19:24.977
It was precise.

19:24.977 --> 19:26.871
It was a fuckin' map!

19:26.871 --> 19:27.704
Do you understand the point of the map?

19:27.704 --> 19:28.537
No map, we get lost.

19:28.537 --> 19:30.890
That's why they have maps, that's why, you know,

19:30.890 --> 19:32.766
they were invented so people aren't wandering around

19:32.766 --> 19:34.392
lost and bumping into each other,

19:34.392 --> 19:35.389
you know what I'm saying?

19:35.389 --> 19:37.128
Yeah, I get that Carl but we're not exactly

19:37.128 --> 19:39.592
gonna be bumping into anyone down here, are we?

19:39.592 --> 19:41.145
Oh is that meant to make me feel better, is it?

19:41.145 --> 19:44.027
Carl, Carl, Carl, think about it, okay?

19:44.027 --> 19:45.832
How many times you been through the map?

19:45.832 --> 19:46.850
You know the map.

19:46.850 --> 19:47.848
And no reception thank you very much.

19:47.848 --> 19:49.112
It doesn't matter, you know the map.

19:49.112 --> 19:51.523
Hey hey hey hey, we don't need the map.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.112
We've got this.

19:53.112 --> 19:54.112
Brilliant.

19:56.772 --> 19:58.948
Yeah sure it's a guide but there's no directions there!

19:58.948 --> 20:01.514
Buddy you know my sense of direction is supernatural.

20:01.514 --> 20:02.764
Supernatural?

20:03.672 --> 20:05.590
Yeah that makes perfect sense.

20:05.590 --> 20:06.594
Okay tell me this.

20:06.594 --> 20:09.213
What's the distance between those landmarks?

20:09.213 --> 20:12.380
You take one wrong stream you're lost!

20:13.929 --> 20:16.090
I agree with you.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.941
Let's just take the first gully out of here.

20:17.941 --> 20:18.774
Zac!

20:21.957 --> 20:23.457
No, let's push on.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.185
North, from memory.

20:45.402 --> 20:48.069
(pensive music)

21:36.734 --> 21:38.984
(giggling)

21:54.190 --> 21:58.023
So it was north to the Stepping Cascade, eh?

21:59.712 --> 22:01.777
Then east to Firefly Gully.

22:01.777 --> 22:02.694
No, west.

22:05.453 --> 22:07.620
No I'm sure it was east.

22:09.853 --> 22:11.603
I'll spud you for it.

22:19.377 --> 22:20.774
You always pick scissors.

22:20.774 --> 22:23.607
Then let me win once in a while.

22:24.930 --> 22:27.915
So do you forgive me then?

22:27.915 --> 22:29.832
I'll spud you for it.

22:43.734 --> 22:45.590
She's amazing.

22:45.590 --> 22:48.555
Toni, I knew you liked Toni.

22:48.555 --> 22:49.793
No, not Toni.

22:49.793 --> 22:51.057
Dylan: Pippa?

22:51.057 --> 22:52.854
Carl: Yeah.

22:52.854 --> 22:54.187
She's beautiful.

22:56.990 --> 22:58.668
She's okay.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.753
How come she's single?

23:00.753 --> 23:02.503
Well, we're single.

23:04.795 --> 23:07.616
Do you think, I dunno, do you think

23:07.616 --> 23:09.783
she'd be interested in me?

23:10.955 --> 23:13.288
Maybe I should have a crack.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.995
You wanna give it a crack?

23:17.995 --> 23:20.162
You could be my wingman.

23:21.393 --> 23:22.226
Yeah?

23:24.177 --> 23:26.260
(laughs)

23:27.867 --> 23:28.700
Yeah.

23:30.641 --> 23:31.808
Cool.
Yeah.

23:35.243 --> 23:37.826
(gentle music)

24:01.925 --> 24:04.927
How are we doing without that map, Dylan?

24:04.927 --> 24:08.927
How are you doing without your vibrator, Toni?

24:26.949 --> 24:27.949
Hey.
Hey.

24:31.243 --> 24:34.325
Hey, you got sore shoulders?

24:34.325 --> 24:35.158
Yeah.

24:49.647 --> 24:51.466
(giggles)

24:51.466 --> 24:52.961
Too sensitive.
Sorry.

24:52.961 --> 24:54.586
I'm sorry.

24:54.586 --> 24:56.047
You're not sorry.
I am, I am.

24:56.047 --> 24:56.880
Liar.

24:59.828 --> 25:01.995
Okay, I'm a bad boy, so.

25:03.487 --> 25:06.869
Oh, well there's only one way to redeem yourself,

25:06.869 --> 25:08.485
bad boy.

25:08.485 --> 25:09.930
How?

25:09.930 --> 25:10.948
Oh!
Say you love feminists.

25:10.948 --> 25:12.287
Oh, stop it.

25:12.287 --> 25:13.866
Say you love feminists.

25:13.866 --> 25:15.046
Alright!
Say it!

25:15.046 --> 25:15.879
I love feminists!
(giggling)

25:15.879 --> 25:16.712
Say it!

25:20.159 --> 25:22.114
Hey Dylan, do you love feminists?

25:22.114 --> 25:22.947
(claps)

25:22.947 --> 25:25.233
Dyl, Dylan, do you love feminists?

25:25.233 --> 25:27.415
More than life.

25:27.415 --> 25:29.292
Hey, where's the camera?

25:29.292 --> 25:30.209
Photo time!

25:31.330 --> 25:32.163
You okay?

25:33.932 --> 25:36.171
Hey where's Zac?
Who cares?

25:36.171 --> 25:38.012
Having Zac time.

25:38.012 --> 25:39.335
A classic depressive, I reckon.

25:39.335 --> 25:40.894
Sociopathic tendencies.

25:40.894 --> 25:43.975
Ooh, so he could sneak into our tent and molest us?

25:43.975 --> 25:46.033
I'm gonna eat you, you dickhead!

25:46.033 --> 25:47.052
You pieholes!

25:47.052 --> 25:48.609
Yeah Led Zeppelin fucking rocks man!

25:48.609 --> 25:50.913
Except for you, why don't you stick your tray

25:50.913 --> 25:52.496
up your arse, mate?

25:53.815 --> 25:55.065
No no no no no.

25:55.953 --> 25:57.620
He's the one I want.

26:00.337 --> 26:02.504
(giggles)

26:04.241 --> 26:06.908
(pensive music)

26:38.144 --> 26:39.394
What?
Nothing.

26:42.846 --> 26:43.679
Don't.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.312
Doesn't feel right.

26:47.427 --> 26:50.509
Here's okay, they can't see us.

26:50.509 --> 26:51.342
No, us.

26:54.507 --> 26:55.966
Us.

26:55.966 --> 26:56.799
Yes.

27:01.646 --> 27:04.846
You haven't fallen in love with me, have you?

27:04.846 --> 27:05.679
Yeah.

27:12.568 --> 27:13.818
It's alright.

27:22.925 --> 27:24.967
You don't find me attractive.

27:24.967 --> 27:25.800
I do.

27:28.784 --> 27:29.867
I'm boring.

27:34.842 --> 27:35.675
What?

27:39.769 --> 27:40.769
What, Dylan?

27:41.727 --> 27:43.477
I'm just fucked up.

27:47.550 --> 27:49.133
I'm just fucked up!

27:50.005 --> 27:52.505
(tense music)

28:03.107 --> 28:03.940
Mm, mm.

28:06.809 --> 28:08.809
Best meal ever, brother.

28:13.097 --> 28:16.782
Something kinda sexy about a guy who cooks, eh girls?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.766
If he can cook well.

28:18.766 --> 28:20.933
Yeah well, I can't cook.

28:22.750 --> 28:24.073
Useless.

28:24.073 --> 28:26.846
That's true, he can't cook at all.

28:26.846 --> 28:28.596
Absolutely useless.

28:31.021 --> 28:31.854
Actually.

28:33.779 --> 28:37.637
You know the only thing I am good at?

28:37.637 --> 28:38.887
Lifting things.

28:40.003 --> 28:43.253
You need something lifted, I'm not bad.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.840
I'm not brilliant.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.982
I mean, don't give me a piano.

28:49.982 --> 28:52.315
I reckon I could lift it but

28:55.000 --> 28:58.622
I wouldn't be able to tune it afterwards

28:58.622 --> 29:02.579
'cause it's a very delicate thing, the piano.

29:02.579 --> 29:05.496
All the notes and tones and things.

29:10.899 --> 29:12.200
But what's it matter?

29:12.200 --> 29:16.283
You don't have a piano and I can't play for shit.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.040
You're not completely useless, chief.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.443
You can mix drinks.

29:21.443 --> 29:24.819
Yeah you can do the bar at Pippa's 21st.

29:24.819 --> 29:26.819
Who says he's invited?

29:35.272 --> 29:36.769
What's going on?

29:36.769 --> 29:38.355
So Dylan where's this gully out

29:38.355 --> 29:40.894
'cause I wanna be out of here by tomorrow.

29:40.894 --> 29:44.894
I told you Zac, north to the Stepping Cascade,

29:45.811 --> 29:46.814
and then west--

29:46.814 --> 29:48.371
To the Firefly fuck whatever.

29:48.371 --> 29:49.968
Yeah I seen the t-shirt.

29:49.968 --> 29:51.651
Okay Zac.

29:51.651 --> 29:54.734
Why don't we navigate by the stars then?

29:54.734 --> 29:56.152
Hey?

29:56.152 --> 29:58.211
You work on boats.

29:58.211 --> 30:00.515
Sextant and stars.

30:00.515 --> 30:02.894
Who needs a map eh captain?

30:02.894 --> 30:04.414
Alright then give me the compass.

30:04.414 --> 30:06.489
Oh, now you're embracing the concept.

30:06.489 --> 30:07.711
Give me the compass, I'm not shitting you.

30:07.711 --> 30:09.961
(chuckles)

30:31.875 --> 30:34.458
(gentle music)

31:16.726 --> 31:17.809
Carl?
Hmm?

31:20.466 --> 31:21.466
You awake?

31:23.902 --> 31:25.319
You wanna talk?

31:27.883 --> 31:30.966
Eight years man, eight years today.

31:36.599 --> 31:38.843
Let's go say hello to him.

31:38.843 --> 31:39.760
Fuck off.

31:41.526 --> 31:43.359
Luke's with us, man.

31:45.744 --> 31:47.494
On a spiritual level.

31:49.547 --> 31:51.214
On a physical level.

31:53.083 --> 31:54.747
Here.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.414
He's with us, man.

32:04.462 --> 32:05.295
Here.

32:10.443 --> 32:12.026
I do it every year.

32:14.585 --> 32:16.918
Same candle for eight years.

32:19.926 --> 32:20.759
You?

32:30.369 --> 32:33.452
Why don't you say something to him?

32:45.664 --> 32:48.247
(wind blowing)

32:58.907 --> 32:59.990
Oh, shocking.

33:02.822 --> 33:03.655
Carl.

33:05.968 --> 33:06.968
Carl.
What?

33:24.790 --> 33:26.288
It was animals.

33:26.288 --> 33:28.768
Probably possums or rats.

33:28.768 --> 33:31.125
Well you can't control the animals, Carl.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.623
You can control putting the food away.

33:33.623 --> 33:34.868
I was drunk.

33:34.868 --> 33:35.701
No shit.

33:36.845 --> 33:38.907
Hey, what's going on?

33:38.907 --> 33:41.030
All our food's been eaten by animals.

33:41.030 --> 33:42.197
Toni: What?

33:46.611 --> 33:49.331
All I've got left are these Easter eggs.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.532
It's okay, we'll be fine, trust me.

33:51.532 --> 33:54.282
Zac: So who left the food out?

34:02.611 --> 34:04.632
Hey, I've got an apple.

34:04.632 --> 34:06.253
I can slice this up.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.854
(cries out)

34:07.854 --> 34:09.373
Shit, I'm so stupid.

34:09.373 --> 34:11.568
Let me have a look.

34:11.568 --> 34:13.434
No no no no leave it alone, leave it alone.

34:13.434 --> 34:16.351
It's not deep, you'll be alright.

34:23.389 --> 34:24.786
What are you doing?

34:24.786 --> 34:25.790
Packing.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.790
Do you have a plan or are you just running away?

34:27.790 --> 34:29.272
We keep looking for the tree.

34:29.272 --> 34:31.047
Keep looking for the tree, yeah Carl?

34:31.047 --> 34:33.870
We've got no food, no map, we're over schedule.

34:33.870 --> 34:34.871
What's your problem?

34:34.871 --> 34:37.011
Fuck the tree.

34:37.011 --> 34:38.451
We head downstream.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.925
Downstream's always the way out.

34:39.925 --> 34:43.085
Yes, but the tree, downstream, and the way out

34:43.085 --> 34:44.772
are one and the same, brother.

34:44.772 --> 34:46.909
I'm not your brother.

34:46.909 --> 34:49.928
What are we gonna do about this food, Dylan?

34:49.928 --> 34:50.931
I'll fish.

34:50.931 --> 34:52.408
Give me a line I can feed us for a week.

34:52.408 --> 34:53.768
I'm a vegetarian.

34:53.768 --> 34:54.871
Well what if you're hungry?

34:54.871 --> 34:56.291
I'm a vegetarian.

34:56.291 --> 34:58.392
Well I'll catch you some berries!

34:58.392 --> 35:00.208
Harder to hunt, easier to kill.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.708
(tense music)

35:05.272 --> 35:06.105
Yeah?

35:09.845 --> 35:10.678
Come on.

35:52.928 --> 35:53.845
Dead end!

35:56.990 --> 35:59.568
So what's going on, brother?

35:59.568 --> 36:03.735
Unless you have the powers to move through rock.

36:05.152 --> 36:08.992
That's what happens when we follow Zac.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.588
Can I have an Easter egg?

36:10.588 --> 36:11.808
In a couple of hours.

36:11.808 --> 36:13.244
I've got low blood sugar.

36:13.244 --> 36:14.832
We've gotta ration, Toni.

36:14.832 --> 36:17.211
We've gotta ration.

36:17.211 --> 36:18.444
I can't.

36:18.444 --> 36:20.496
I'll faint, I'll fit, I'll die!

36:20.496 --> 36:22.640
Do you get that?

36:22.640 --> 36:25.307
Turning into one of those girls.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.059
One of those hysterical, crying, irritating

36:28.059 --> 36:31.059
need help girls just like my mother!

36:32.037 --> 36:34.370
So far so good eh captain?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.040
Have mine.

36:59.499 --> 37:00.332
Really?

37:01.598 --> 37:04.560
Just don't tell anyone, okay?

37:04.560 --> 37:05.393
Yeah.

37:15.313 --> 37:16.730
Is that better?

37:18.880 --> 37:22.316
Hey Carl, you know there was never a chance

37:22.316 --> 37:24.566
that you or I would have...

37:27.744 --> 37:31.661
Well it felt kind of forced, don't you think?

37:32.923 --> 37:34.203
Yeah.

37:34.203 --> 37:36.536
Yeah it felt totally forced.

37:45.843 --> 37:48.426
(mellow music)

40:11.740 --> 40:14.700
(cries out)

40:14.700 --> 40:18.033
(acoustic guitar music)

40:51.701 --> 40:55.578
Be back soon.
Where are you going?

40:55.578 --> 40:59.745
See how high I can get, maybe get some phone coverage.

41:17.221 --> 41:18.054
Pippa.

41:19.840 --> 41:23.507
Can you just stop drawing me for a second?

41:25.613 --> 41:27.317
Where are you going?

41:27.317 --> 41:28.304
To get a drink.

41:28.304 --> 41:29.804
Can I come?
No.

41:31.515 --> 41:33.848
I don't know, just draw Zac.

41:45.355 --> 41:48.188
(uncertain music)

42:08.277 --> 42:10.360
(grunts)

42:18.133 --> 42:20.795
Whenever you're on the edge of something like that

42:20.795 --> 42:23.712
you ever get the urge to just jump?

42:26.715 --> 42:28.798
I'm going back to camp.

42:47.771 --> 42:48.604
Hey.

42:50.812 --> 42:51.645
Brother.

42:52.831 --> 42:54.433
That's the Stepping Cascade.

42:54.433 --> 42:57.016
(gentle music)

42:58.193 --> 43:00.360
It's gotta be, look at it.

43:01.553 --> 43:03.916
Climb the steps, west to Firefly Gully.

43:03.916 --> 43:07.499
Firefly Gully leads to the Wollemia Pine.

43:08.657 --> 43:11.495
Or downstream to the way out.

43:11.495 --> 43:13.535
No no no no fuck them!

43:13.535 --> 43:15.676
Let's keep this to ourselves.

43:15.676 --> 43:19.093
I'm gonna find that tree for us, brother.

43:22.653 --> 43:23.486
Not now!

43:24.615 --> 43:26.865
Just getting my bearings.

43:39.696 --> 43:40.624
Carl: Pippa.

43:40.624 --> 43:41.457
Hi.

43:46.016 --> 43:47.183
Where's Dylan?

43:50.922 --> 43:53.660
We found the Stepping Cascade.

43:53.660 --> 43:55.060
What?

43:55.060 --> 43:56.643
To get to the tree?

43:59.199 --> 44:02.782
Dylan's still obsessed by the tree but...

44:04.016 --> 44:05.266
I'm freezing.

44:07.104 --> 44:08.354
Yeah, me too.

44:09.538 --> 44:11.455
(pats)

44:19.738 --> 44:21.603
What's wrong?

44:21.603 --> 44:23.103
Nothing, just...

44:27.683 --> 44:28.600
I'm just...

44:31.982 --> 44:32.899
I'm just...

44:50.505 --> 44:52.125
Carl.

44:52.125 --> 44:52.958
Carl.

44:53.886 --> 44:54.719
Carl!

45:01.545 --> 45:02.545
I'm sorry.

45:04.585 --> 45:05.418
I'm sorry.

45:15.869 --> 45:17.952
Happy Easter, everyone.

45:21.278 --> 45:24.159
You know what the best thing about this time of year is?

45:24.159 --> 45:26.197
Discount Easter eggs.

45:26.197 --> 45:27.947
Little bunny rabbits.

45:28.917 --> 45:30.476
My favorite.

45:30.476 --> 45:33.535
Although I don't mind the birdies either.

45:33.535 --> 45:34.368
Hey.

45:36.799 --> 45:38.959
I paid for that chuff.

45:38.959 --> 45:39.792
Mm.

45:52.639 --> 45:53.472
Hey Dylan!

45:54.639 --> 45:56.472
Come join the funeral.

45:58.857 --> 46:01.774
Oh come on kids, what's the matter?

46:04.876 --> 46:07.706
Alright, let's play a game.

46:07.706 --> 46:09.789
Pippa, let's play a game.

46:13.343 --> 46:15.760
Let's imagine we're all dead.

46:18.543 --> 46:20.561
But we come back as a mythical creature.

46:20.561 --> 46:21.703
What would you be?

46:21.703 --> 46:24.405
Mythical creature?
Yeah.

46:24.405 --> 46:26.442
Like a sun god.

46:26.442 --> 46:27.359
Or a nymph.

46:28.906 --> 46:30.986
She'd be Mother Earth.

46:30.986 --> 46:32.560
Mother Earth?

46:32.560 --> 46:33.560
That's nice.

46:35.045 --> 46:37.743
But she'd have to put up with a lot of abuse.

46:37.743 --> 46:40.493
Oh don't worry, I'll be gentle.

46:41.786 --> 46:44.161
Oh yeah that's good isn't it.

46:44.161 --> 46:45.158
(tense music)

46:45.158 --> 46:46.741
Oh, oh you love me.

46:48.023 --> 46:49.946
Oh you really love me.

46:49.946 --> 46:51.279
Stop it Dylan!

46:55.445 --> 46:56.695
You were right.

46:59.082 --> 47:00.582
You are fucked up.

47:01.638 --> 47:03.845
Completely fucked up.

47:03.845 --> 47:04.678
Eh?

47:06.746 --> 47:08.829
What's she talking about?

47:10.720 --> 47:11.553
Dylan?

47:14.005 --> 47:15.755
You tell him or me?

47:20.666 --> 47:22.166
We've got a thing.

47:26.678 --> 47:27.511
What?

47:34.602 --> 47:35.435
With him?

47:38.543 --> 47:39.376
Dylan.

47:42.186 --> 47:44.019
Carl: For how long?

47:45.161 --> 47:49.328
Toni: It's been going on for a couple of weeks.

47:53.937 --> 47:54.770
Right.

47:57.303 --> 47:58.136
Right.

48:03.500 --> 48:05.457
Hey I fucked up, brother.

48:05.457 --> 48:08.040
I'm not your fucking brother.

48:11.605 --> 48:13.765
Celebration of life tour!

48:13.765 --> 48:14.863
Bullshit.

48:14.863 --> 48:17.662
Celebration of Luke tour!

48:17.662 --> 48:18.495
Luke?

48:19.340 --> 48:20.173
Luke.

48:21.445 --> 48:22.442
Luke's dead.

48:22.442 --> 48:23.562
You get it?

48:23.562 --> 48:25.146
He's dead!

48:25.146 --> 48:27.466
No he's with us man, he's with me!

48:27.466 --> 48:29.959
He's not your brother, Dylan!

48:29.959 --> 48:30.792
Not yours!

48:31.802 --> 48:33.719
He's my grief, my loss!

48:35.398 --> 48:37.546
He's my brother.

48:37.546 --> 48:38.379
Mine.

48:39.935 --> 48:42.518
(solemn music)

49:02.595 --> 49:05.345
Luke wasn't alone when he died.

49:13.993 --> 49:18.010
You see he came 'round to my house that day.

49:18.010 --> 49:19.752
He wanted to go for a ride.

49:19.752 --> 49:22.735
You didn't so I said yes and we went out.

49:22.735 --> 49:25.318
We went up the top of the hill.

49:29.889 --> 49:33.306
I said to him, "I bet you can't beat me!"

49:36.597 --> 49:37.514
He set out.

49:39.295 --> 49:41.462
He wanted to win so badly.

49:46.613 --> 49:49.196
Then that white Commodore, man.

49:52.277 --> 49:54.527
Just plowed right into him.

50:05.659 --> 50:06.492
And I ran.

50:10.437 --> 50:11.354
Whatever.

50:12.997 --> 50:14.997
It was my fault, Carl.

50:33.557 --> 50:36.224
(pensive music)

51:18.736 --> 51:20.293
You know if you're worried,

51:20.293 --> 51:24.126
thinking this is all your fault, you're right.

51:27.934 --> 51:30.894
I mean you asked me along.

51:30.894 --> 51:32.311
You lost the map.

51:33.475 --> 51:35.392
Then you lost the food.

51:37.555 --> 51:39.638
You even dumped the girl.

51:42.053 --> 51:43.470
You lied to Carl.

51:48.234 --> 51:49.817
So how do you feel?

51:51.358 --> 51:52.358
Brilliant.

51:55.635 --> 51:57.052
I feel brilliant.

52:13.555 --> 52:16.222
(pensive music)

52:36.334 --> 52:38.217
He's taken it.

52:38.217 --> 52:39.800
I can't believe it!

52:43.395 --> 52:44.228
Carl.

52:45.871 --> 52:47.038
He's taken it.

52:48.136 --> 52:48.969
My camera.

52:50.638 --> 52:52.638
He's taken the rope too.

52:54.330 --> 52:56.617
Why?
You tell me.

52:56.617 --> 52:58.534
This says gone fishing.

53:02.574 --> 53:04.718
Well he's gone fishing.

53:04.718 --> 53:07.218
With my camera and the rope.

53:09.474 --> 53:11.254
Where do you think he's gone then?

53:11.254 --> 53:14.969
He's gone looking for the tree, Carl.

53:14.969 --> 53:17.657
Let me get this straight.

53:17.657 --> 53:19.990
You're calling Dylan a liar?

53:24.452 --> 53:26.474
Maybe he drowned.

53:26.474 --> 53:27.724
Shut up, Zac.

53:29.311 --> 53:30.938
Then we could all push on.

53:30.938 --> 53:33.953
Actually maybe he's just behind that rock right there,

53:33.953 --> 53:35.953
hiding, head-fucking us.

53:37.296 --> 53:38.796
Dylan!

53:38.796 --> 53:40.018
Dylan!

53:40.018 --> 53:42.185
(echoing)

53:43.759 --> 53:44.592
Pip.

53:46.516 --> 53:48.016
He'll come back.

53:56.019 --> 53:57.102
I'm hungry.

53:58.596 --> 54:01.179
(urgent music)

54:27.199 --> 54:29.532
(cries out)

55:08.027 --> 55:08.860
Dylan!

55:47.005 --> 55:49.255
(spitting)

56:09.402 --> 56:12.735
(acoustic guitar music)

56:54.384 --> 56:57.184
Hey where'd you find that?

56:57.184 --> 56:59.605
It was in my pocket.

56:59.605 --> 57:02.624
Did he leave anything for me?

57:02.624 --> 57:04.700
Why would he leave anything for you?

57:04.700 --> 57:05.707
(tense music)

57:05.707 --> 57:07.824
Because I'm his girlfriend.

57:07.824 --> 57:09.771
Pippa wake up.

57:09.771 --> 57:11.744
You know this has nothing to do with you.

57:11.744 --> 57:13.782
Yes it does, it does.

57:13.782 --> 57:14.615
No no!

57:15.467 --> 57:18.165
(acoustic guitar music)

57:18.165 --> 57:18.998
Please.

57:19.925 --> 57:22.603
Told you we shoulda left earlier.

57:22.603 --> 57:24.405
My temperature's all over the place.

57:24.405 --> 57:25.403
Look at these shakes.

57:25.403 --> 57:27.104
Yeah actually I'm a little bit chilly.

57:27.104 --> 57:30.664
So why don't you put a jacket on?

57:30.664 --> 57:33.747
Can you stop cleaning for a second?

57:35.223 --> 57:36.056
Carl!

57:38.245 --> 57:40.407
Think you missed a bit.

57:40.407 --> 57:44.574
(smashing)
(grunting)

57:47.043 --> 57:49.845
(laughing)

57:49.845 --> 57:53.669
Dylan won't be too happy about that, will he?

57:53.669 --> 57:56.848
I'm heading downstream, are you coming?

57:56.848 --> 57:58.681
Give me the compass.

57:59.605 --> 58:01.749
I'll send help when I get out.

58:01.749 --> 58:03.582
Give me the compass.

58:04.469 --> 58:05.302
Zac!

58:07.707 --> 58:10.457
(dramatic music)

58:33.550 --> 58:34.967
Play me a tune.

58:36.541 --> 58:38.116
Just give me the compass!

58:38.116 --> 58:40.366
(laughing)

58:58.617 --> 59:00.408
(cries out)

59:00.408 --> 59:02.741
(screaming)

59:17.299 --> 59:20.716
You know it's really not that bad, Zac.

59:22.963 --> 59:24.963
I've seen way worse, eh?

59:27.716 --> 59:29.939
(crying out)

59:29.939 --> 59:31.397
Pippa.

59:31.397 --> 59:32.480
Do something.

59:35.721 --> 59:37.388
Pippa, do something.

59:44.659 --> 59:46.909
(shushing)

59:50.738 --> 59:54.061
We've gotta get Zac out of here.

59:54.061 --> 59:55.644
What about Dylan?

59:57.923 --> 01:00:00.340
Toni: Zac is the priority.

01:00:01.459 --> 01:00:03.709
Well Dylan's my priority.

01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:07.506
Even after your brother?

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:14.110
That's none of your fucking business.

01:00:15.295 --> 01:00:16.295
None at all.

01:00:18.163 --> 01:00:19.996
Stop pointing at me.

01:00:21.779 --> 01:00:24.279
We've gotta be rational, Carl.

01:00:25.519 --> 01:00:29.581
That stick in his leg will get infected.

01:00:29.581 --> 01:00:30.659
We'll pull it out.

01:00:30.659 --> 01:00:32.117
(laughs)

01:00:32.117 --> 01:00:34.034
We can't pull it out.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.421
He'll bleed to death.

01:00:37.421 --> 01:00:40.099
He's already got a fever.

01:00:40.099 --> 01:00:43.923
He needs antibiotics, a doctor, a hospital,

01:00:43.923 --> 01:00:45.590
he needs food, food.

01:00:47.379 --> 01:00:48.629
Pippa: Food.

01:00:49.777 --> 01:00:52.527
As for Dylan, he could be dead.

01:00:58.224 --> 01:01:01.557
Hey, why don't we eat our Easter eggs?

01:01:27.547 --> 01:01:28.630
I ate them.

01:02:02.202 --> 01:02:04.535
(screaming)

01:02:14.741 --> 01:02:17.324
(gentle music)

01:03:13.612 --> 01:03:15.862
(groaning)

01:04:36.128 --> 01:04:38.711
What are you doing?
I'm hot.

01:05:01.371 --> 01:05:03.538
When's Carl coming back?

01:05:06.283 --> 01:05:08.450
(giggles)

01:05:13.551 --> 01:05:16.468
(mysterious music)

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:29.024
Dylan!

01:06:19.005 --> 01:06:19.838
Dylan!

01:06:30.503 --> 01:06:31.336
Dylan!

01:06:55.362 --> 01:06:57.695
(shivering)

01:08:31.263 --> 01:08:32.095
Dylan?

01:08:43.234 --> 01:08:44.067
Dylan!

01:08:45.212 --> 01:08:46.046
Hello.

01:09:41.162 --> 01:09:43.761
I'm not eating that.

01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:45.761
You're getting weaker.

01:09:47.198 --> 01:09:49.584
Still have my principles, Carl.

01:09:49.584 --> 01:09:52.020
You ate an Easter egg.

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.938
Fuck you.

01:09:57.541 --> 01:10:01.161
I take my vegetarianism very seriously.

01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:03.578
(crying out)

01:10:25.836 --> 01:10:28.003
(humming)

01:10:57.510 --> 01:11:00.177
We're gonna find your boyfriend.

01:11:22.894 --> 01:11:25.227
(unzipping)

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:45.299
They suit me?

01:11:47.411 --> 01:11:48.244
Sure.

01:11:49.328 --> 01:11:52.745
You're meant to say I look like a star.

01:11:53.614 --> 01:11:56.364
You look like a star.

01:11:56.364 --> 01:11:57.614
Like the sun?

01:12:00.381 --> 01:12:01.214
Sure.

01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:35.333
He gave this to me.

01:14:00.639 --> 01:14:03.389
(dramatic music)

01:14:10.548 --> 01:14:12.798
(coughing)

01:15:27.641 --> 01:15:30.141
(tense music)

01:15:33.902 --> 01:15:35.402
Carl: You okay?

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:40.860
(breathing heavily)

01:16:18.805 --> 01:16:20.638
Isn't that our rope?

01:16:27.201 --> 01:16:28.034
Dylan!

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.233
Okay.

01:17:14.918 --> 01:17:17.918
(breathing heavily)

01:18:08.791 --> 01:18:09.624
I'm up!

01:18:55.691 --> 01:18:56.524
Ready.

01:19:34.742 --> 01:19:36.992
(groaning)

01:19:51.324 --> 01:19:53.241
Wait, wait wait wait.

01:20:06.706 --> 01:20:09.373
(pensive music)

01:21:08.943 --> 01:21:09.776
Dylan?

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:23.419
Dylan?

01:21:27.263 --> 01:21:29.013
I slipped off that.

01:21:32.127 --> 01:21:34.710
I've done something to my back.

01:21:35.887 --> 01:21:37.054
Can't feel it.

01:21:47.146 --> 01:21:48.300
Can you feel that?

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.133
Aye.

01:21:55.647 --> 01:21:58.266
Just put your arm around my neck, we'll get you out.

01:21:58.266 --> 01:21:59.466
Come on.
(crying out)

01:21:59.466 --> 01:22:00.299
Come on.

01:22:21.567 --> 01:22:23.567
Hey, I found the tree.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.143
You should go see it.

01:22:36.143 --> 01:22:38.976
It's just near in the next canyon.

01:22:44.554 --> 01:22:45.387
No.

01:22:52.822 --> 01:22:55.322
The green was blinding, man.

01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:58.708
You should touch the bark.

01:23:01.706 --> 01:23:05.873
It was weird, it was like these ancient trees, you know?

01:23:11.865 --> 01:23:15.782
I understand why you wanted to see it, brother.

01:23:17.823 --> 01:23:19.740
I'm not your brother.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:29.294
Thanks for taking me along.

01:23:38.538 --> 01:23:39.705
Hey brother.

01:23:41.823 --> 01:23:45.073
I don't think we're gonna make it, man.

01:23:48.463 --> 01:23:49.296
No.

01:24:04.303 --> 01:24:06.386
(crying)

01:25:00.916 --> 01:25:03.833
(mysterious music)

01:25:31.082 --> 01:25:32.165
Is he dead?

01:25:35.057 --> 01:25:35.890
Yeah.

01:26:04.343 --> 01:26:06.926
