00:38.988 --> 00:39.690
Hey, Neil.

00:39.790 --> 00:40.591
Hey, What's Up, Bro?

00:40.591 --> 00:42.995
Hey, Guys.

00:42.995 --> 00:44.599
Sorry We're Late, Man.

00:44.599 --> 00:46.202
Everything Okay?

00:46.202 --> 00:48.206
Yeah, Everything Except
For The Line At The Java Hut.

00:48.206 --> 00:49.007
Oh, That's My Fault.

00:49.408 --> 00:50.610
I Don't Get A Double Latte Before Noon,

00:50.610 --> 00:52.213
I'm Toast The Rest Of The Day.

00:52.213 --> 00:53.415
Never Been A Problem For Me.

00:53.415 --> 00:55.018
Yeah,
Not With Your New Mutancy.

00:55.018 --> 00:56.621
Hey, How Much Sleep
Do You Need, Anyway?

00:56.621 --> 00:58.625
About Half An Hour, Mostly.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.029
I'd Save Fifty
Bucks A Week On Coffee Alone
If I Had Your Mutant Powers.

01:01.430 --> 01:03.834
Only Problem Is Finding
Stuff To Do To Fill The Time.

01:04.235 --> 01:07.441
Sure Does Help
Driving Cross Country.

01:07.441 --> 01:09.845
But That Makes You The
Perfect Courier For The
New Mutant Underground.

01:09.845 --> 01:11.849
Still Means I Got To Watch
A Lot Of Other People Snooze

01:11.849 --> 01:13.452
While I'm Wide Awake.

01:13.452 --> 01:16.658
The Cyto-Filter Adam Requested
From Doc Hollis Is Over There.

01:17.058 --> 01:19.463
And This Goes Back
With You To Dr. Hollis.

01:19.863 --> 01:21.867
It's Adam's New Prototype
For A Genetic Sequencer.

01:22.268 --> 01:24.672
If Dr. Hollis Can
Replicate The Technology,

01:24.672 --> 01:26.676
Then We Can Stick Them In
Safe Houses Across The Country.

01:27.076 --> 01:28.680
Help Restore The
Dna Of Ailing New Mutants.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.283
Not To Worry.

01:30.283 --> 01:31.885
You Can Tell Adam
It'll Ride Up Front With Me.

01:32.287 --> 01:33.489
Great.

01:33.489 --> 01:34.691
Want To Give
Me A Hand Over Here?

01:34.691 --> 01:35.893
Adam's Gear Is On The Bottom.

01:36.294 --> 01:37.095
Yeah.

01:37.095 --> 01:38.298
I'll Be
Right There.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.500
Yeah.

01:46.313 --> 01:47.915
What The Hell?

01:47.915 --> 01:49.919
Hey, Guys.

01:49.919 --> 01:51.121
Where Did It Go?

02:14.364 --> 02:16.368
Ach. Forget It.

02:16.368 --> 02:18.772
I Thought I Heard Someone
In Here Before You Guys Came In.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.775
Yeah, Well, Whoever Or
Whatever It Is Is Long Gone.

02:20.775 --> 02:23.179
Who's Going
To Tell Adam?

02:25.985 --> 02:27.187
He Is.

03:29.201 --> 03:31.205
I Knew The
Minute That Word About
The Sequencer Got Out

03:31.205 --> 03:33.208
There That Something
Like This Might Happen,

03:33.208 --> 03:36.414
So I Installed
A Built-In Tracking
Device In The Control Panels

03:36.414 --> 03:39.621
So That The Minute It's
Activated It Can Be Tracked.

03:39.621 --> 03:41.624
Right In The Heart
Of Genomex I'll Bet.

03:41.624 --> 03:42.826
Oh, Not Necessarily.

03:42.826 --> 03:44.830
It's Not Really Of Any
Use To Eckhart Or The Gsa,

03:44.830 --> 03:48.036
But For Any New Mutant
Whose Dna Is Mutating...

03:48.036 --> 03:51.241
Out Of Control It
Could Really Be Useful.

03:51.241 --> 03:54.047
Now, I Have To Say, You Seem
To Be Taking This Very Calmly.

03:54.447 --> 03:56.050
Well,
What Do You Suggest?

03:56.050 --> 03:57.654
I Don't See How Anger's
Going To Bring It Back?

03:58.054 --> 03:59.657
Yeah, But We're Talking
About A One-Of-A-Kind Prototype

03:59.657 --> 04:02.462
You Spent A Year
Of Your Life Working On.

04:02.462 --> 04:04.065
I Don't
Know - I Just Figured
You'd Be A Little Bit

04:04.065 --> 04:05.668
More Upset About It.

04:05.668 --> 04:07.271
Well, You Seem Upset
Enough For Both Of Us.

04:07.672 --> 04:10.076
Look. There Are Very
Few Mutants With This Stealth
Gift Out There, Right?

04:10.076 --> 04:12.881
So, If One Of Them Is
Desperate Enough To Steal It,

04:12.881 --> 04:14.484
Then They Probably
Really Need Our Help.

04:14.885 --> 04:18.091
You Keep Saying Stealth
Instead Of Invisible.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.694
Yeah.

04:19.694 --> 04:21.697
Because They're
Not Like H.G. Wells'
Invisible Man.

04:21.697 --> 04:26.907
They Emit An Aura
That Serves As A Kind
Of Light-Reflecting

04:26.907 --> 04:30.113
Shield And Then
They Remain Invisible
Within This Shield.

04:30.113 --> 04:32.517
Now, The Problem
Is That If This Aura
Starts To Break Down,

04:32.517 --> 04:35.724
It Can Be Extremely
Debilitating.

04:36.124 --> 04:38.528
Why Don't You
And Shalimar Go Over To
The Safehouse And See

04:38.528 --> 04:40.131
What You Can
Find Out For Me.

04:40.131 --> 04:41.333
Okay, But...

04:41.333 --> 04:42.937
Okay?
Thanks.

04:42.937 --> 04:44.539
Okay.

04:50.550 --> 04:54.557
Ah, The Informant Alden Berkley.

04:54.557 --> 04:56.561
It's Aldous.

04:56.561 --> 04:58.565
Come On, Man.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.568
I've Been Feeding
You Tons Of Dope On These
Mutants For A While Now.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.374
And You've
Been Well-Compensated
For It, I Might Add.

05:03.374 --> 05:05.779
What Do You Want Now?

05:05.779 --> 05:07.782
I'm Sick Of Being
On The Outside Looking In.

05:07.782 --> 05:10.187
Seems To Me I
Deserve A Steady Gig.

05:10.187 --> 05:13.794
Do You Expect Me To
Provide This "Steady Gig"?

05:13.794 --> 05:15.396
Well, I've...

05:15.396 --> 05:17.801
I've Got Some Information
On The Disappearance

05:17.801 --> 05:20.205
Of A Valuable Piece
Of Mutant X Hardware.

05:20.605 --> 05:22.209
Mild Interest, At Best.

05:22.209 --> 05:25.014
Ripped Off From
Mutant X By An Invisible Thief.

05:25.014 --> 05:27.819
Invisible?

05:28.220 --> 05:31.025
According To My Sources, This
Thief Had Stealth Abilities.

05:34.231 --> 05:37.036
And Where Is This
Stealth Mutant Now?

05:37.036 --> 05:39.440
That I Couldn't Tell You.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.245
But, Man, You Give
Me A Shot And I'll Find Out.

05:42.245 --> 05:47.054
Your Information Has Always
Been Dependable, Mr. Berkley.

05:47.054 --> 05:51.462
Talk To Mr. Kelland In Personnel
About Getting You Outfitted.

05:51.462 --> 05:53.466
Thanks.

05:59.477 --> 06:01.882
Is It Just Me Or Is Adam Acting
A Little Weird About All This?

06:01.882 --> 06:03.484
What Do You Mean?

06:03.886 --> 06:05.088
I Don't Know.

06:05.088 --> 06:07.492
Wouldn't You Expect Him To
Be Really Pissed Off That The

06:07.893 --> 06:09.495
Sequencer Was Stolen?

06:09.495 --> 06:13.102
Yeah, But He Wasn't
Really Angry, Was He?

06:13.102 --> 06:17.911
More Like He Was Excited
About The Thought
Of An Invisible Thief.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.723
You Know,
He Really Did Come Right Out And Say It,

06:24.723 --> 06:26.727
But I Think He Kind
Of Knows Who Did This.

06:26.727 --> 06:29.933
A Stealth Mutant Who's
Got Some History With Him.

06:34.741 --> 06:36.345
What Have You Got?

06:36.345 --> 06:38.348
Blood.

06:43.157 --> 06:44.359
Not Much.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.363
Enough To Run A Dna Test.

06:51.573 --> 06:53.576
I'd Say There's No Doubt
About It: This Blood Sample Is

06:53.576 --> 06:57.584
Definitely A New
Mutant And, Thanks To You,

06:57.584 --> 06:59.587
Now I Know It's A Woman.

06:59.989 --> 07:01.591
But Beyond That,
I Am Clueless.

07:01.591 --> 07:03.194
No Idea Who It Could Be.

07:03.194 --> 07:04.797
Why?

07:04.797 --> 07:06.400
I Mean, I Figured You'd
Be Able To Get A Precise

07:06.400 --> 07:08.804
Dna Signature And Then
Match It Against The Database.

07:08.804 --> 07:09.606
Yeah. Ordinarily, Yeah.

07:10.007 --> 07:11.209
But This Dna's So Deteriorated,

07:11.609 --> 07:13.213
I Can Barely
Identify It As Human.

07:13.213 --> 07:15.617
Well, I Guess Now I Know Why
Our Thief Was So Desperate To

07:15.617 --> 07:17.220
Get Her Hands On The Sequencer.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.422
Exactly.

07:18.422 --> 07:21.628
However, Using The Sequencer
On Dna This Deteriorated's Like

07:22.029 --> 07:24.433
Using A Band-Aid On A Broken Neck.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.642
Adam?

07:29.642 --> 07:30.844
Yeah?

07:30.844 --> 07:32.448
We Got A Hit.

07:34.852 --> 07:36.455
You Got A Location?

07:36.855 --> 07:38.859
And A New Record For
The Sanctuary Dash.

07:41.264 --> 07:44.470
It's A House At
2459 Sixth Street.

07:44.470 --> 07:46.073
Just Off Fairwood.

07:48.878 --> 07:50.881
Adam, We Should've
Gone With You.

07:50.881 --> 07:52.485
Not This Time.

07:52.485 --> 07:54.088
This Is Something
I Have To Do Alone.

07:54.088 --> 07:55.290
You Sure?

07:55.690 --> 07:56.892
You Guys Stay Put.

07:57.294 --> 07:58.896
I Got It Covered.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.364
Danielle.

08:41.775 --> 08:44.179
It Was The
Wind That Did Me In.

08:44.179 --> 08:46.184
Twice.

08:46.584 --> 08:47.786
Mmm.

08:47.786 --> 08:50.191
And It Blew The Leaves That
Revealed Your Arm And...

08:50.191 --> 08:52.995
And It Carried
Your Fragrance To Me.

08:52.995 --> 08:54.599
Mmm.

08:54.599 --> 08:57.003
You Always Knew
How To Touch Me, Adam.

09:05.519 --> 09:07.523
So Why Did
You Steal This?

09:07.523 --> 09:09.126
I Heard
It Could Help Me.

09:09.526 --> 09:11.530
Alright.
Come With Me.

09:11.530 --> 09:13.133
Gotta Go.

09:13.534 --> 09:14.335
No, No. Wait.

09:14.736 --> 09:15.938
Meet Me Tonight.

09:15.938 --> 09:17.941
You Know Exactly Where.

09:19.945 --> 09:21.548
Go Get Her.

09:57.214 --> 09:58.416
How Did It Go?

09:58.416 --> 09:59.218
It Didn't.

09:59.218 --> 10:00.420
Hey, Did You
Find The Sequencer?

10:01.222 --> 10:02.424
Hey, I've Been
Trying To Reach You.

10:02.424 --> 10:03.225
Turned Off My Comlink.

10:03.225 --> 10:04.427
Is Everything Okay?

10:04.828 --> 10:06.030
I Got My Ass Kicked.

10:15.648 --> 10:16.449
I'm Going To, Uh...

10:16.850 --> 10:18.453
Yeah, I'll Help You With...

10:24.864 --> 10:27.269
What Are
You Looking At?

10:27.269 --> 10:30.475
It's The Dna
From That Blood Sample.

10:30.475 --> 10:33.681
The Chromosomes
Look Splintered.

10:33.681 --> 10:35.684
Yeah.

10:40.092 --> 10:42.897
This Woman That
Stole The Sequencer,

10:43.299 --> 10:46.103
She Wasn't Just
A Child Of Genomex.

10:46.504 --> 10:48.508
She Meant
A Lot To You, Huh?

10:50.912 --> 10:52.916
Are You Scanning Me?

10:53.317 --> 10:55.321
There's No Need.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.923
You're An Open Book.

10:57.325 --> 10:59.328
Huh.

10:59.328 --> 11:01.332
Yeah.

11:01.332 --> 11:03.736
Her Name Was
Danielle Hartman.

11:03.736 --> 11:07.343
Met Her, Oh, Sixteen
Years Ago At Genomex.

11:07.343 --> 11:12.151
She Was Still Struggling
With Her... Gift.

11:12.151 --> 11:15.358
I Fell In Love With Her.

11:15.358 --> 11:18.563
So What Happened?

11:18.563 --> 11:20.567
I Don't Know.

11:20.567 --> 11:22.571
I Think She Knew Her Lifespan
Was Going To Be Limited.

11:22.971 --> 11:25.776
I Guess She Just Didn't
Want To Get Tied Down.

11:25.776 --> 11:27.380
You Guess?

11:27.380 --> 11:29.784
You Never Talked
To Her About It?

11:29.784 --> 11:31.387
No. Never Had The Chance.

11:31.787 --> 11:36.195
She Just... Disappeared.

11:41.406 --> 11:45.012
I Thought
I Made Myself Clear:

11:45.012 --> 11:47.817
The Device Is Of
Secondary Interest To Me.

11:47.817 --> 11:49.420
You Want The Stealth
Mutant, Right?

11:49.821 --> 11:51.424
This Is Phase One.

11:51.824 --> 11:54.228
And When Can
I Expect Phase Two?

11:54.630 --> 11:57.435
She Slipped By Us
- But We'll Get Her.

11:57.435 --> 11:59.037
A Woman?

11:59.037 --> 12:01.442
Yeah.
Named Danielle Hartman.

12:07.854 --> 12:09.857
You Failed To Detect
Her Presence Even Equipped

12:09.857 --> 12:11.861
With Infrared Goggles?

12:11.861 --> 12:15.868
We Didn't Have
Goggles That Time.

12:15.868 --> 12:18.674
I Think It's Time To
Reassign This Case To A More

12:19.074 --> 12:21.479
Experienced Squad Leader.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.483
You Need Somebody As
Connected As Me On Your Team.

12:23.483 --> 12:26.287
It Appears To Me Your
Connections Only Get You So Far.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.093
After That, Competence -
Or Lack Of It - Comes Into Play.

12:29.093 --> 12:31.498
Just...

12:31.498 --> 12:36.707
Please,
Mr. Eckhart, Just Give Me
A Shot - I'll Bring Her In.

12:36.707 --> 12:39.913
You're Aware Of The
Consequences If You Don't?

12:39.913 --> 12:42.718
I Hear It All Out On The Street.

12:42.718 --> 12:46.324
Just Don't
Harm Her In Any Way.

12:46.324 --> 12:49.129
Am I Clear,
Mr. Berkley?

12:49.531 --> 12:51.935
As A Bell.

13:32.008 --> 13:34.012
Hey.

13:34.012 --> 13:36.016
Hey.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.420
I Knew You'd Remember.

13:38.420 --> 13:41.225
I Wasn't
Sure You'd Show Up.

13:41.225 --> 13:44.030
I Wasn't All That Sure Myself.

13:47.236 --> 13:49.240
So Have I Changed As
Much As This Place Has?

13:49.240 --> 13:53.247
You Haven't
Changed A Bit.

13:53.247 --> 13:55.251
That's My Line.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.656
Then We'd Both Be Lying.

14:02.063 --> 14:03.667
Cheers.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.269
Cheers.

14:08.075 --> 14:10.479
You're Still
Very Beautiful.

14:10.479 --> 14:12.884
Hmm.

14:12.884 --> 14:15.288
So What's Happening?

14:15.288 --> 14:18.093
Exactly As You Predicted.

14:18.093 --> 14:20.497
So Why Haven't
You Come To See Me?

14:20.497 --> 14:24.104
The Way I Left...

14:24.104 --> 14:26.909
I Thought You'd Hate Me.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.313
I Did.

14:29.313 --> 14:31.718
For A While.

14:32.119 --> 14:35.726
So Why'd You Just
Leave Like That?

14:35.726 --> 14:38.130
After What Mason Told Me,

14:38.130 --> 14:40.935
I... Didn't Have Much Choice.

14:40.935 --> 14:42.939
What'd He Tell You?

14:42.939 --> 14:46.545
That Genomex Was
Everything To You.

14:46.545 --> 14:50.953
If I Stayed, I'd Spend My
Life As Your Lab Experiment.

14:51.354 --> 14:54.159
And You Believed Him?

14:54.159 --> 14:56.563
You Didn't See That Was
His Jealousy Talking?

14:56.563 --> 15:00.972
I Trusted Mason
- And So Did You.

15:00.972 --> 15:03.777
Once Upon A Time.

15:08.987 --> 15:11.792
I Knew You'd Never
Accept The Inevitable.

15:11.792 --> 15:14.998
I Wanted To
Enjoy The Time I Had.

15:15.398 --> 15:19.405
Not Pine
Away For Some Miracle Cure
That Wasn't Going To Happen.

15:19.405 --> 15:23.814
Yeah.

15:23.814 --> 15:26.618
So You Made A
Decision For Both Of Us.

15:32.229 --> 15:34.233
Danielle?

15:34.233 --> 15:37.038
You Okay?

15:41.045 --> 15:44.251
I'm Beginning
To Lose Control.

15:51.464 --> 15:53.869
You Know, I'm Not
Comfortable With This.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.472
What?

15:55.472 --> 15:57.075
I Mean, If Adam Finds
Out, We'll Just...

15:57.075 --> 15:59.880
You Know,
Tell Him That We Were
Looking For Evidence.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.685
Yeah, Well, Let's Hope
Adam Doesn't Find Out.

16:06.692 --> 16:08.696
Okay. Okay.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.910
This Is Breaking
And Entering, You Know.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.512
It's All
For A Good Cause.

16:17.512 --> 16:19.516
Snooping Into
Adam's Private Life?

16:19.516 --> 16:21.921
Look, He Hasn't
Seen Or Heard From This
Woman In Sixteen Years.

16:22.321 --> 16:23.523
We Don't Know
What She's After.

16:23.924 --> 16:24.725
Ah, Right. Right.

16:25.126 --> 16:27.130
So We're Doing
This For His Protection.

16:27.530 --> 16:29.935
Yes.

16:29.935 --> 16:32.740
Okay.

16:35.946 --> 16:37.950
What's That?

16:37.950 --> 16:40.354
"Catherine, Having
Dinner With An Old Friend.

16:40.354 --> 16:42.358
Back Before
You Know It."

16:42.758 --> 16:43.961
Who Do You Think
Catherine Is?

16:43.961 --> 16:45.965
I Think We're
About To Find Out.

16:50.373 --> 16:52.376
Mom?

17:03.998 --> 17:06.801
Who's There?

17:17.222 --> 17:20.027
Who The Hell Are You?

17:20.428 --> 17:23.633
We're...

17:23.633 --> 17:25.637
Uh...
Friends Of Your Mother.

17:25.637 --> 17:26.839
Yeah.

17:29.645 --> 17:31.248
Cut The Crap.

17:31.248 --> 17:32.450
We Just Moved Here.

17:32.450 --> 17:34.454
My Mom Doesn't Have Any Friends.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.057
We're New Mutants.

17:36.457 --> 17:38.061
Like You And Your Mother.

17:38.061 --> 17:40.465
Has Your Mom Ever Talked
About A Guy Named Adam?

17:40.465 --> 17:42.468
You Know Adam?

17:42.468 --> 17:45.674
I Think The Gsa's Back.

17:45.674 --> 17:47.277
We Better Get Out Of Here.

17:47.678 --> 17:48.479
I Can Go Stealth.

17:48.479 --> 17:50.083
That's Not
Going To Help You.

17:58.097 --> 17:59.700
Done.

18:23.744 --> 18:25.347
You're Going To Jump?

18:25.347 --> 18:27.351
Yeah, And So Are You.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.015
I Want To Run Some New Tests.

18:44.015 --> 18:45.617
Adam,
Don't Play With Me.

18:45.617 --> 18:47.221
It's Too
Late For That.

18:47.221 --> 18:50.026
What About Ephenol?

18:50.026 --> 18:51.628
Ephenol.

18:51.628 --> 18:52.830
No.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.434
Does More Damage Than Good.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.037
Mason Thought It Had
A Lot Of Promise.

18:56.037 --> 18:57.639
Well, Mason Doesn't Know
What He's Talking About.

18:57.639 --> 18:59.243
Ephenol Has Never Been
Successfully Administered.

18:59.643 --> 19:01.647
But It's Proven To
Halt Dna Mutation.

19:01.647 --> 19:03.650
Yeah, It's Also Been Proven
To Have Serious Side Effects.

19:03.650 --> 19:04.852
Fine.

19:05.254 --> 19:07.257
But The Right Dosage
On The Right Subject...

19:07.658 --> 19:09.261
Danielle,
It's Too Risky.

19:09.261 --> 19:11.665
I'm Willing
To Take The Risk.

19:11.665 --> 19:13.669
All Right, Look, There's
Got To Be Another Way.

19:13.669 --> 19:15.672
I Don't Have Time
To Find Another Way.

19:15.672 --> 19:19.680
I've Got To Do This
- For Catherine.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.085
Catherine?

19:22.085 --> 19:23.687
My Daughter.

19:24.088 --> 19:27.694
How Old Is She?

19:27.694 --> 19:31.702
She Just Turned Fifteen.

19:31.702 --> 19:34.908
I Passed My
Mutancy On To Her.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.313
I Don't Want Her
To Go Through This.

19:42.522 --> 19:43.724
Danielle.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.327
Don't.

19:45.327 --> 19:46.930
I Can't Stop It.

19:47.331 --> 19:51.739
I'll Take You
Back To Sanctuary.

19:57.750 --> 19:58.952
You're Using The Ephenol?

19:58.952 --> 20:00.155
Yeah.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.158
Just Half The
Recommended Dosage.

20:02.559 --> 20:04.562
Maybe It'll Buy
Us A Little Time.

20:04.562 --> 20:06.566
See, The Real Problems With
Ephenol Are The Wild Card

20:06.566 --> 20:08.570
Side Effects It Has On Dna.

20:08.570 --> 20:11.375
So We Need To Monitor This
Thing Very Closely Otherwise,

20:11.375 --> 20:14.180
We're Not Going To Know The
Impact That The Drug Has On Her

20:14.180 --> 20:16.985
Strand Until It's Almost Too
Late To Do Anything About It.

20:26.203 --> 20:28.206
All Right. Good.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.044
It Seems To Be Working.

20:55.055 --> 20:57.460
Like I Said,
We Need To Monitor Her
System Really Closely.

21:00.265 --> 21:02.669
This Really Sucks.

21:10.684 --> 21:13.088
What's This
Place Supposed To Be?

21:13.489 --> 21:17.095
Well, We Call It Sanctuary.

21:17.497 --> 21:19.500
You Ever
Hear Of Mutant X?

21:22.306 --> 21:23.908
Come On.

21:24.309 --> 21:25.511
You Two?

21:25.511 --> 21:27.915
And Adam?

21:27.915 --> 21:31.121
Well,
You're Looking At The Mutant
X Secret Headquarters.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.728
Huh-Ha,
And Now That I'm Here,

21:34.728 --> 21:37.132
Three-Fifths
Of The Mutant X Team.

21:37.132 --> 21:39.537
Brennan,
This Is Catherine,
Danielle's Daughter.

21:39.937 --> 21:41.139
Hi.

21:41.541 --> 21:43.143
Where's My Mother?

21:43.143 --> 21:44.746
Umm...

21:47.150 --> 21:48.754
What Happened?

21:48.754 --> 21:50.357
She's Here, But...

21:50.757 --> 21:51.959
I Want To See Her.

21:51.959 --> 21:53.563
Now.

21:53.563 --> 21:54.765
Well, Adam Thinks It's
Better That She Doesn't Have

21:54.765 --> 21:57.169
Any Visitors Right Now.

21:57.169 --> 21:59.173
Is She Getting Worse?

21:59.173 --> 22:00.376
It's Okay.

22:00.776 --> 22:02.379
Adam's Treating Her Now.

22:07.589 --> 22:09.592
Catherine...

22:10.394 --> 22:11.996
Been Here Before.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.603
Hey.

22:15.603 --> 22:16.805
Hey.

22:16.805 --> 22:18.409
Mmm.

22:18.409 --> 22:19.611
Not Now.

22:19.611 --> 22:20.813
Lie Back.

22:20.813 --> 22:22.015
You Need To Rest.

22:22.416 --> 22:24.018
So You Tried The Ephenol.

22:24.018 --> 22:25.622
Just Half A Dose.

22:25.622 --> 22:28.026
Welcome Back.

22:29.629 --> 22:31.231
You Okay?

22:31.231 --> 22:32.835
I'll Be Fine.

22:32.835 --> 22:34.438
How Did
You Get Here?

22:36.442 --> 22:37.644
We Brought Her In.

22:38.044 --> 22:39.647
Thanks.

22:42.051 --> 22:44.456
These Guys Are Mutant X.

22:44.857 --> 22:46.860
There's Someone
I Want You To Meet.

22:48.464 --> 22:51.268
You're Adam?

22:51.268 --> 22:53.673
Hello, Catherine.

22:53.673 --> 22:56.077
My Mom's Told
Me All About You.

23:00.486 --> 23:02.490
C'mon, Man,
We Staked Out Her Place
In Case She Comes Back.

23:02.890 --> 23:04.092
The Clock Is
Ticking, Mr. Berkley.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.294
Yeah, Yeah.

23:05.294 --> 23:06.897
There's A New Development.

23:06.897 --> 23:08.099
She's Got A Daughter.

23:08.501 --> 23:10.905
Does The Daughter Have
Stealth Abilities?

23:11.305 --> 23:12.508
It's Possible.

23:12.908 --> 23:14.512
We Didn't See Her.

23:14.512 --> 23:16.515
Okay.

23:16.515 --> 23:19.721
We Did Find This In A
Backpack With Some Textbooks.

23:20.121 --> 23:21.725
She's Fifteen, Man.

23:21.725 --> 23:25.331
Danielle's Nearing The End
Of Her Short But Unhappy Life.

23:25.331 --> 23:31.743
But Her Daughter - This Girl
Could Be The Key To The Kingdom.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.147
Make Her Your Priority.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.585
Adam's Doing Everything
He Can To Help Your Mom.

23:54.986 --> 23:57.791
There's
Nothing He Can Do.

23:57.791 --> 24:01.397
My Mother
Knows She's Dying And
She's Trying To Help Me.

24:01.397 --> 24:04.202
Do You Have
Any Other Family?

24:04.604 --> 24:07.008
We're It.

24:07.008 --> 24:10.615
What About Your Father?

24:10.615 --> 24:13.419
Not In The Picture.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.224
Never Was.

24:16.224 --> 24:19.831
Did Your Mom Ever Tell
You Anything About Him?

24:19.831 --> 24:23.437
All She Ever Said
Was That He Was Smart.

24:23.437 --> 24:28.247
And For A Little
While, They Really
Loved Each Other.

24:43.074 --> 24:44.677
Hey, Take It Easy.

24:44.677 --> 24:47.482
The Ephenol's Working.

24:47.482 --> 24:49.485
I Can Feel It.

24:50.688 --> 24:52.291
What You're Feeling
Are The Euphoric Side Effects.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.294
I'm Healing. I Know It.

24:54.294 --> 24:55.898
I Haven't Felt
This Good In Months.

24:55.898 --> 24:57.500
No. Here. C'mon,
I Want You To Sit Down.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.103
You Shouldn't
Be On Your Feet.

24:59.103 --> 24:59.905
Why Not?

25:00.305 --> 25:01.507
You've Done It.

25:01.507 --> 25:03.511
You're As Brilliant As Ever.

25:03.511 --> 25:05.114
No. Listen...

25:05.114 --> 25:06.316
Listen.
Thanks.

25:06.316 --> 25:07.518
But Hey.

25:07.518 --> 25:09.122
C'mon, There's
Something You Gotta Know.

25:09.522 --> 25:11.125
The Dose That I Gave You
Has Bought You Some Time,

25:11.526 --> 25:13.931
But Your
Bloodwork Shows That
It's All That It's Done.

25:13.931 --> 25:16.335
I Know I Can
Handle The Full Dosage.

25:16.335 --> 25:17.537
No.

25:17.537 --> 25:19.140
Until I've Run More Tests,
There's No Way To Tell

25:19.140 --> 25:20.744
How Much Your
System Can Take.

25:20.744 --> 25:22.346
I Know How I Feel.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.949
Huh.

25:23.949 --> 25:25.552
I Wish It Was That
Simple, But It's Not.

25:25.953 --> 25:27.155
I Mean, Look,
It's Already Affecting
Your Judgement.

25:27.155 --> 25:30.361
If You Don't Give It To Me,
I Know Someone Who Will.

25:30.361 --> 25:33.566
You Want To Do That?

25:33.566 --> 25:35.971
Eckhart Can
Not Be Trusted?

25:35.971 --> 25:37.975
Hey?

25:37.975 --> 25:39.577
What About Catherine?

25:39.577 --> 25:41.581
If Something Goes
Wrong, What About Her?

25:41.982 --> 25:43.585
All Right.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.588
We'll Do It Your Way.

25:47.993 --> 25:48.795
Adam?

25:49.195 --> 25:49.997
Yeah?

25:49.997 --> 25:51.599
Sequencer's
Been Activated Again.

25:51.599 --> 25:53.203
He Must Be Testing It.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.806
I'll Be Right There.

25:54.806 --> 25:56.810
Go Do What You Have To.

25:56.810 --> 25:58.412
I'm Fine.

25:58.412 --> 26:00.416
All Right.

26:00.416 --> 26:02.419
Now, I Want You To Lie
Down, Get Some Rest.

26:02.419 --> 26:03.621
Yeah.

26:03.621 --> 26:05.225
Okay.

26:10.434 --> 26:14.442
So It's Still Operating...

26:14.442 --> 26:16.445
Yeah, But If
They're Testing It...

26:16.445 --> 26:18.049
Why Is It Moving?

26:18.449 --> 26:20.854
That's A Good Question. And I
Don't Have The Faintest Idea.

26:20.854 --> 26:22.456
Well, That's Refreshing.

26:22.858 --> 26:24.460
At Least It Reminds
Us That You're Still Human.

26:24.460 --> 26:26.464
So Why Don't You
Guys Take Off For A While?

26:26.464 --> 26:27.666
All Right?

26:28.067 --> 26:29.269
I'll Have Shalimar
Do The Tracking From Here.

26:29.669 --> 26:30.872
But, Guys, Hey - Don't Worry.

26:31.273 --> 26:32.475
You're Not Going
To Miss A Thing.

26:32.876 --> 26:34.078
I'm Sure She'll Give You Regular
Updates On What's Going On

26:34.478 --> 26:36.082
Between Danielle And I.

26:47.702 --> 26:50.107
Danielle?

27:11.747 --> 27:12.950
Danielle...

27:12.950 --> 27:14.552
Lovely To Hear Your Voice.

27:14.552 --> 27:15.754
It's Been Too Long.

27:15.754 --> 27:16.957
Hello, Mason.

27:17.357 --> 27:18.559
To What Do I Owe The Pleasure?

27:18.961 --> 27:21.765
When I Left Genomex, Adam
Was Still Working On My Problem.

27:21.765 --> 27:24.570
Yeah, Something About Your
Premature Mortality, Wasn't It?

27:24.972 --> 27:26.574
Yes.

27:26.574 --> 27:28.177
He Never Solved It.

27:28.578 --> 27:32.185
Now You Are Feeling
The Effects Of His Failure.

27:32.185 --> 27:35.791
And I Was Hoping
You Could Help Me.

27:35.791 --> 27:39.398
Well, Why Don't You And Your
Daughter Come In And We'll See

27:39.798 --> 27:41.802
What We Can Do To Help You Out.

27:41.802 --> 27:43.405
How Do You Know
About My Daughter?

27:43.405 --> 27:45.409
Simple Background Check.

27:45.409 --> 27:47.813
When Can We Expect You?

27:47.813 --> 27:53.424
Why Don't We Get Together
For Dinner And Talk This Over?

27:53.424 --> 27:55.828
Lovely Idea.

27:56.229 --> 27:59.435
I Remember You Were Always
Fond Of Gaetano's, Wasn't It?

27:59.435 --> 28:02.240
Let's Say Eight O'clock.

28:23.479 --> 28:26.284
Hey... We'll Find Her.

28:26.284 --> 28:28.688
Catherine, I Promise.

28:28.688 --> 28:33.097
Whatever My Mother's
Done, She Did It For Me.

28:33.097 --> 28:37.905
Though I Guess That Makes
This My Fault As Much As Hers.

28:37.905 --> 28:40.710
It's Not True.

28:40.710 --> 28:43.516
If Anyone's Responsible For
What's Happened To Her It's Me.

28:43.516 --> 28:45.920
You?

28:45.920 --> 28:49.527
Going Back To When She First
Came To Me For Treatment.

28:49.527 --> 28:53.934
You Mean If You Hadn't
Gotten Together Back Then...

28:54.336 --> 28:56.339
I Wouldn't Be Here?

28:56.740 --> 29:00.347
No.

29:00.347 --> 29:03.152
No.

29:03.152 --> 29:05.956
The Work I Did At
Genomex Saved Her Life.

29:05.956 --> 29:07.960
It Also Gave Her These
Stealth Abilities, Right?

29:08.361 --> 29:11.567
Right.

29:11.567 --> 29:16.776
Now It's These Stealth Abilities
That Are Causing Her The Pain.

29:17.178 --> 29:20.784
Look, If You're As
Smart As She Says You Are,

29:20.784 --> 29:24.391
Why Can't You Help Her?

29:24.391 --> 29:26.795
Well, There's
A Chance That I Can.

29:26.795 --> 29:28.398
I'm Going To Need Your Help.

29:28.799 --> 29:31.604
I'll Do Anything.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.207
Okay, Good.

29:33.608 --> 29:36.012
Because It Hit That If
I Recombine Your Dna With Hers,

29:36.413 --> 29:38.417
There's A Chance That I Can
Reverse Her Breakdown And Maybe

29:38.417 --> 29:42.023
Prevent You From
Having The Same Fate.

29:42.424 --> 29:44.428
And How Do I Do That?

29:44.428 --> 29:46.832
Well, By Using The Genetic
Sequencer That She Stole

29:46.832 --> 29:48.835
From The Safe House.

29:48.835 --> 29:50.439
But Those Guys
That Broke In Took It.

29:50.439 --> 29:54.045
Ah, But I Sent Emma
Back To Try To Find It.

29:58.052 --> 30:00.857
Hey, Emma, The Sequencer's
Come To A Stop.

30:00.857 --> 30:06.067
It's At The Hotel
Infantino On Carmine Street.

30:06.067 --> 30:08.070
What About Danielle?

30:08.070 --> 30:10.074
Well, She Just Pulled Into
The Parking Lot At Gaetano's

30:10.074 --> 30:12.479
And The Guys
Are Already On The Way.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.081
Got It.

30:14.081 --> 30:16.085
Wish Me Luck.

30:26.905 --> 30:31.714
Hey,
Is This Seat Taken?

30:32.115 --> 30:35.722
Huh
- Only By You, Gorgeous.

30:36.122 --> 30:39.729
You And You Alone.

30:39.729 --> 30:42.133
Can I Buy You A Drink?

30:42.133 --> 30:44.938
Amaretto Sour.

30:44.938 --> 30:46.942
Okay.

30:46.942 --> 30:49.347
Amaretto Sour, Please.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.949
Thank You.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.553
You're Welcome.

30:54.957 --> 30:57.362
I Sent The Kitchen Staff Home
And Brought My Own Personal

30:57.362 --> 30:59.766
Chef In For The Evening.

30:59.766 --> 31:02.571
My Dear,
I Hate To Say This But,
On Closer Examination,

31:02.571 --> 31:04.975
You Don't Look Well At All.

31:05.376 --> 31:10.586
We Always Knew
This Stealth Thing Would
Eventually Catch Up With Me.

31:10.586 --> 31:12.990
I'm Here To Help, Danielle.

31:12.990 --> 31:17.399
All Of Genomex
Is At Your Disposal.

31:30.623 --> 31:33.428
You Catching Up On Some Work?

31:33.428 --> 31:38.236
No.

31:38.236 --> 31:40.240
No.

31:40.641 --> 31:43.446
It's Just A Little
Thing I'm Playing With.

31:43.446 --> 31:45.450
Can I Take A Look At It?

31:49.457 --> 31:51.060
Be Careful With It.

31:51.461 --> 31:53.063
It's One Of A Kind.

31:53.063 --> 31:55.067
I'll Bet It Is.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.876
No!

31:59.876 --> 32:03.483
Oh!

32:03.884 --> 32:06.288
You Really Shouldn't
Drink In Public.

32:09.494 --> 32:11.498
Eugh!

32:11.498 --> 32:13.502
Sit Down.

32:19.513 --> 32:22.718
I Moved Upstate And Got A
Job With A Shipping Company.

32:22.718 --> 32:28.328
Kept My New Mutancy
A Secret Until I Couldn't
Control It Any More.

32:28.328 --> 32:31.133
And You Came
Looking For Help.

32:31.133 --> 32:33.939
I Still Had A Few Contacts
In The Underground.

32:33.939 --> 32:37.546
That's How I Found Out
About A Genetic Sequencer.

32:37.546 --> 32:41.152
I Think That If
I Could Get My Hands On It...

32:41.152 --> 32:43.557
Stopgap Measure,
At Best.

32:43.557 --> 32:46.361
But It Might
Keep Me Around A Little
Bit Longer For Catherine.

32:46.762 --> 32:49.968
You're Her Only Family?

32:49.968 --> 32:53.976
Well, Then,
By All Means, We'll Bring
Her To Genomex, Too.

32:53.976 --> 32:58.785
Right Now I Need
To Take Care Of Me, Mason.

32:58.785 --> 33:01.990
We'll Take
Care Of You, Danielle,
But It's Important That

33:01.990 --> 33:04.394
You Have The
Emotional Support...

33:04.394 --> 33:06.799
Just Me.

33:10.005 --> 33:12.810
I'm Torn, Danielle, Between
The Feelings We Once Shared And

33:13.211 --> 33:17.218
The Exigencies Of The Work
That Has Been Thrust Upon Me.

33:17.218 --> 33:24.431
Unfortunately,
Today's Realities
Preclude Yesterday's Romances.

33:28.038 --> 33:30.843
Adam Was Right.

33:44.869 --> 33:48.075
Whatever You Do,
Don't Let Go Of Her.

33:55.288 --> 33:56.891
Sorry I'm Late, Mr. Eckhart.

33:57.292 --> 33:58.895
About Time You Got Here.

33:58.895 --> 34:00.497
What About The Daughter?

34:00.899 --> 34:02.902
Where The Mother Goes,
The Daughter Follows.

34:02.902 --> 34:04.505
Okay.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.317
Gently, Mr. Berkley.

34:11.317 --> 34:14.123
We Need Her In The
Best Of Condition
To Serve As Bait.

34:16.527 --> 34:17.730
Wow. Hand Delivery.

34:17.730 --> 34:19.331
I'll Take Her From Here.

34:28.549 --> 34:30.152
She's Coming With Me.

35:01.811 --> 35:03.413
Adam, Stay Down.

36:16.147 --> 36:18.151
We're On Our Way In.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.356
Emma, I Need You To Download
The Data Into The Sequencer.

36:21.356 --> 36:24.562
Shalimar,
I Need You To Prepare
Catherine's Blood Sample.

36:27.367 --> 36:29.371
Gotta Have A Little
Faith, Catherine.

36:29.371 --> 36:31.375
Your Mom's
Going To Be Fine.

36:33.779 --> 36:34.581
Okay.

36:34.581 --> 36:36.184
Where Do We Stand?

36:36.184 --> 36:37.386
I Followed
Your Instructions
To The Letter,

36:37.386 --> 36:38.989
But You Should
Really Check This Out.

36:44.199 --> 36:45.401
Good.

36:45.801 --> 36:47.004
Catherine's Blood.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.606
Perfect.

36:57.022 --> 36:58.625
Catherine...

36:58.625 --> 37:00.228
Mom.

37:00.228 --> 37:03.033
Don't Worry, Honey,
Everything's Going To Be Okay.

37:03.033 --> 37:05.037
Yeah.

37:05.437 --> 37:07.441
Yeah, You're Right, Mom.

37:07.441 --> 37:09.044
The Sequencer...

37:09.445 --> 37:11.849
It's... It's Going
To Make Everything Better.

37:12.250 --> 37:14.254
It's Just Another
Way You're Like Me.

37:14.654 --> 37:16.658
You're A Lousy Liar.

37:25.474 --> 37:27.078
All Right.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.081
Everybody, Stand By.

37:35.092 --> 37:37.496
I Love You, Mom.

37:37.496 --> 37:41.103
I Love You Too.

37:41.103 --> 37:43.107
All Right.

37:43.107 --> 37:44.309
We're Ready.

38:15.566 --> 38:19.173
Eggs, Bacon,
Cheese And Cream.

38:19.173 --> 38:22.379
Satan's Four Major Food Groups.

38:27.188 --> 38:30.794
Mmm...

38:34.801 --> 38:37.206
I Don't Know What's
Going To Kill Me First.

38:37.206 --> 38:40.011
The Nitrates In The Bacon,
The Fat In The Cheese And Cream,

38:40.011 --> 38:42.816
Or The Cholesterol In The Eggs.

38:42.816 --> 38:46.823
But, We Only
Live Once, Don't We?

38:46.823 --> 38:52.434
You Haven't Even Touched
Your Dinner, Mr. Berkley.

38:52.434 --> 38:55.640
I'm Actually
Not That Hungry.

38:55.640 --> 38:59.247
One Thing You Should
Know About Me:

38:59.247 --> 39:02.051
I Don't Like To Eat Alone.

39:52.143 --> 39:55.750
My Compliments To The Chef.

39:59.758 --> 40:02.162
Well, Neil's All Set
To Go Whenever You Guys Are

40:02.162 --> 40:04.967
- Take You To Your
New Home On The Coast.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.971
And Finally Deliver
The Sequencer To Dr. Hollis.

40:06.971 --> 40:08.173
A-Ha.

40:08.173 --> 40:09.776
Mom?

40:09.776 --> 40:11.780
I'll Be Right There.

40:14.184 --> 40:15.787
Thanks So Much For Everything.

40:15.787 --> 40:16.989
Yeah, Thank You.

40:16.989 --> 40:18.191
You're Great.

40:18.191 --> 40:19.794
Hope To
See You Soon.

40:19.794 --> 40:21.798
Yeah.

40:21.798 --> 40:23.401
Hey, Let Me
Get That For You.

40:23.802 --> 40:29.412
How Long's It Going
To Take Us To Get There?

40:29.412 --> 40:32.618
A Couple Of Days.

40:32.618 --> 40:35.022
You Ever Get A Chance
To Visit The Coast?

40:35.423 --> 40:37.427
No.

40:39.029 --> 40:40.633
Well, No, She's Great.

40:41.033 --> 40:42.636
You Don't Have
To Tell Me That.

40:42.636 --> 40:44.640
Done A Wonderful
Job Raising Her.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.644
Hasn't Always Been Easy.

40:46.644 --> 40:51.853
You Know I Have
To Ask You, Right?

40:51.853 --> 40:56.261
She's Not Your Daughter.

41:01.070 --> 41:03.875
I Can See How
Disappointed You Are.

41:03.875 --> 41:07.081
I'm Sorry For That.

41:07.081 --> 41:11.088
Well,
I Was Wondering Where She
Got Those Blue Eyes, Anyway.

41:15.497 --> 41:18.703
Thank You.

41:19.103 --> 41:20.706
Now You Have To Go.

41:20.706 --> 41:22.710
Yeah.

41:23.110 --> 41:25.114
I've Got A Daughter
To Finish Raising.

41:25.114 --> 41:28.320
But You Know Where I Am.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.526
That I Do.

41:37.538 --> 41:39.541
I'll See You.

41:39.541 --> 41:41.545
Soon.
