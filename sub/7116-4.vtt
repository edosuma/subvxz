00:05.800 --> 00:08.950
Okay. Okay, you wanna know what I really think?

00:09.140 --> 00:13.610
Lana, put the fork down.
Just put it down.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.079
You wanna know what makes me sick?!

00:16.110 --> 00:18.530
Is it eating tuna fish on a Ferris wheel?

00:20.060 --> 00:23.000
'Cuz I did that once
and I threw up on a bird.

00:24.490 --> 00:28.680
Shhhhh!!!
She's rehearsing a scene.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.190
Yeah, my father's a deadbeat.

00:30.220 --> 00:32.390
But you can't make me blame him
for what I am

00:32.420 --> 00:34.390
'cuz you're the one who did this to me!

00:34.420 --> 00:37.250
You're garbage!

00:45.220 --> 00:46.990
What? What's so funny?

00:47.030 --> 00:50.290
You.
The Scene you were doing.

00:50.330 --> 00:54.870
Right? Wasn't it ridiculous?

00:54.900 --> 00:58.840
Oh sure, go ahead, laugh at my acting.

00:58.870 --> 01:02.180
Ohhh Tori...
We're not laughing at your acting...

01:02.210 --> 01:06.850
We're laughing because of your acting.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.550
What scene were you doing?

01:08.580 --> 01:10.120
It's for a role in a movie.

01:10.150 --> 01:13.590
... About a teenager whose parents send
her to a home for troubled girls.

01:13.620 --> 01:17.720
Oh. One time my brother went
to a home for troubled girls.

01:18.460 --> 01:21.290
- Why?
- To meet troubled girls.

01:23.870 --> 01:26.970
Y'know, bus stations are good for that.

01:27.010 --> 01:28.170
Hey!

01:28.210 --> 01:29.780
My audition is next Tuesday!

01:29.810 --> 01:30.580
So?

01:30.610 --> 01:34.210
So tell me what was so bad
about my acting in The Scene!

01:34.250 --> 01:36.280
Look, you're a good actor...

01:36.320 --> 01:39.520
But you're still playing
The Scene too safe.

01:39.550 --> 01:41.710
Totally agree.

01:42.390 --> 01:45.530
You're supposed to be a
troubled teen girl on the edge.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.630
And to play that kind of emotion,
you can't just be your usual.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.930
Prissy little Tori.

01:51.970 --> 01:55.350
- Prissy?!
- The bird died.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.570
My throw-up got in his eyes.

01:58.610 --> 02:01.050
And he flew into a roller coaster.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.650
You wanna get this role?

02:07.690 --> 02:10.550
You need less priss...
And more risk.

02:10.590 --> 02:13.560
Make us believe you're dangerous.

02:13.590 --> 02:14.990
... On the edge.

02:15.030 --> 02:17.100
Hmm?

02:17.130 --> 02:22.700
Okay. Okay. I'm dangerous.
Risky.

02:22.740 --> 02:25.340
Okay. Let's do it... go!

02:25.370 --> 02:26.840
Action!

02:26.880 --> 02:29.180
Lana... just tell me why.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.780
You tried to push your Uncle
off that cliff.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.580
You ask me one more question,

02:33.620 --> 02:37.240
I'll rip that pencil outta your hand
and stick it right in your neck!

02:41.430 --> 02:44.860
Okay, that does it.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.940
Oh! Oh!

02:51.900 --> 02:55.440
Mister purples!

02:55.480 --> 02:58.040
Hey Sikowitz, for our homework
assignment do you want us to...

03:02.480 --> 03:03.810
Good luck to you.

04:12.430 --> 04:14.620
- Check.
- Check.

04:14.660 --> 04:16.790
I'll check.

04:16.970 --> 04:18.700
I bet... five reds.

04:20.529 --> 04:24.680
I call your five reds...
...And raise you two yellows.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.120
- You gotta put 'em in the pot.
- 'Kay.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.820
So when do you audition for the movie?

04:37.850 --> 04:39.820
- Tuesday.
- You ready?

04:39.860 --> 04:40.750
I thought I was...

04:40.790 --> 04:44.090
Until Sikowitz said my audition
stinks 'cuz I don't take risks.

04:44.130 --> 04:45.330
Can you guys believe that?

04:45.360 --> 04:48.130
- Yes, you're boring.
- Absolutely, one hundred percent.

04:48.130 --> 04:49.500
I take risks.

04:49.530 --> 04:52.300
Like yesterday at school there was
a line for the girls' bathroom.

04:52.330 --> 04:56.700
So I just walked
right into the boys' bathroom.

04:56.740 --> 04:58.400
Uh yep.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.310
You used the boys' bathroom?

05:00.340 --> 05:01.740
Nooooo, it was disgusting in there.

05:01.780 --> 05:04.610
What is wrong with you guys?

05:04.640 --> 05:07.110
We're playing cards...
You in or out?

05:07.150 --> 05:10.680
- Uhhhh...
- She's in.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.380
Tori...
Tori, did a package come for me?

05:13.420 --> 05:15.020
- No.
- Oooh.

05:15.060 --> 05:15.950
What'd you gettin'?

05:15.990 --> 05:20.590
- I ordered these delicious new
fazini shoes with ten-inch heels.

05:20.630 --> 05:22.660
- Who can walk
in ten-inch heels?

05:22.700 --> 05:24.820
Awesome people like me.

05:25.730 --> 05:27.630
- Where's my package?
- I don't know...

05:27.670 --> 05:29.230
Why don't you call the shipping company?

05:29.270 --> 05:31.400
Why don't you call my butt?

05:32.840 --> 05:35.810
- Whose turn is it?
- Me. And I'm in.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.880
- Call.
- Awww, it's an automated help line.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.180
Listen...

05:40.210 --> 05:43.950
To track a package, say...
Or speak...

05:43.980 --> 05:46.380
Your package tracking number.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.990
Ah, now I have to find my tracking number?

05:49.020 --> 05:51.120
Yes.

05:51.160 --> 05:56.560
- Turn off your speaker phone.
- Why don't you turn off your butt?

05:56.600 --> 05:59.000
What's with her and butts?

05:59.030 --> 06:01.370
Jade, go.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.900
I bet five reds.

06:02.940 --> 06:04.800
And two yellows...

06:04.840 --> 06:08.840
And I raise... fourteen blues.

06:08.870 --> 06:11.140
- I'm out.
- Too much candy.

06:11.180 --> 06:13.750
- Foldeesimo.
- Here it is. Tracking number:

06:13.780 --> 06:25.960
A - k - 3 - 5 - h - j - 1 - 4 -
7 - 7 - h - y - 7 - f - l - 4...

06:25.990 --> 06:28.960
Fourteen blues, Robbie.
You in?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.860
Well... I have good cards...
But I don't have fourteen blues.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.400
- Me neither.
- Then let's make this interesting.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.450
Yeah!
Let's dress up as pirates!

06:43.280 --> 06:46.380
If one of you guys wins, you get the pile.

06:46.410 --> 06:50.320
But if I win, you get hammer time.

06:50.350 --> 06:52.720
- Hammer time?
- What's that about?

06:52.750 --> 06:56.390
For one week, any time I see
you and say "hammer time"...

06:56.430 --> 06:58.370
You have to do the hammer dance.

07:01.260 --> 07:05.530
- Okay. It's a bet.
- And I will also bet.

07:05.570 --> 07:10.100
Good. I got three queens.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.870
Aw man! I had three nines.

07:11.910 --> 07:15.380
Canasta!

07:15.410 --> 07:19.580
- We're not playing canasta.
- Ohhh. Then I lost bad.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.250
Woo hoo! Better get
your dancin' shoes ready, boys.

07:23.290 --> 07:32.710
- ...6 - q - l - 4 - k - 3 - 2 - 8 - m - d - 3...

07:32.900 --> 07:36.230
And anyway, why do you have to
"take risks" to be a good actor?

07:36.270 --> 07:39.300
Because acting is about stepping
outside your comfort zones.

07:39.340 --> 07:42.100
About pushing your emotions to new places.

07:42.140 --> 07:46.370
Ooo I'm Beck, I know about
acting, I say words.

07:49.050 --> 07:52.110
I don't see why we can't
just pretend to be pirates.

07:52.150 --> 07:53.820
I'll play pirates with you.

07:53.850 --> 07:57.400
No. I don't like
how you play pirates.

07:59.890 --> 08:02.490
Okay, so I need to learn to take risks.

08:02.530 --> 08:03.520
What do I do?

08:03.560 --> 08:05.960
- Well...
- Why don't you take her to the gorilla club?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.130
- Uh-uh.
- No way.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.300
Tori Vega is not ready
for the gorilla club.

08:09.330 --> 08:11.770
I'm not? Yes I am!
Why aren't I? I love animals.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.370
Gorilla club? What's that?

08:14.410 --> 08:17.170
Oh, it's just a fun place
with lotsa cool things to do.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.970
Yeah, cool things that'll jank you up.

08:19.010 --> 08:21.180
Oh, I am not afraid of a janking.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.840
Tori, trust me.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.950
The gorilla club is a dangerous place...

08:24.980 --> 08:30.750
- ...K - l - 5 - 4 - 9 - b - d - 6.

08:30.790 --> 08:31.920
Will you stop that?!

08:31.950 --> 08:35.250
Shush! They're about to tell
me where my package is!

08:35.289 --> 08:41.360
- Your package was delivered... at...
Eight... twenty-one... P.M.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.660
- 8:21?
- It's 8:21 right now.

08:44.700 --> 08:48.100
Oooh!

08:48.140 --> 08:51.870
I don't see the delivery...

08:51.910 --> 08:55.910

Hey Trina.
Are those fazini shoes?

09:18.940 --> 09:22.410
- They sure are...
With ten-inch heels.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.340
That's a hot shoe.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.610
I know.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.310
Um, I'm still learning how to walk in them.

09:28.350 --> 09:31.520
- Would you mind...
- Just grab on.

09:33.850 --> 09:36.020
Hey there. Hi.

09:36.060 --> 09:41.790
Oh, oh hey. Fazini shoes.
I'm wearing 'em. They're mine.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.970
Um, Aleece? Hey Aleece.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.270
- Um. Andre, right?
- All day. Yeah.

09:52.310 --> 09:53.740
So, um... here's what's up:

09:53.780 --> 09:56.440
Some friends of mine might be goin'
to the gorilla club tonight.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.750
And if you don't have any plans, I
was thinkin' maybe me and you...

09:58.780 --> 10:01.010
Hammer time.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.620
Not now all right?
I'm trying to talk to Aleece...

11:23.660 --> 11:25.830
Why do we have to sign these?

11:35.010 --> 11:37.940

Do people get hurt here a lot?

11:37.980 --> 11:40.010
- A lot?
- Yeah.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.100
Yeah.

11:50.490 --> 11:52.160
Ooo! The bunny's available!

11:52.190 --> 11:54.030
- I don't know if you wanna be ridin'...
- Bunnyyyyyyyyy!

11:54.060 --> 11:57.500
Okay. All right.

11:57.530 --> 12:01.270
So, which of these games should I try?

12:01.300 --> 12:02.240
Yeah... y'know,

12:02.270 --> 12:04.670
I really don't think you need
to try one of these games.

12:04.710 --> 12:07.840
- But I wanna take a risk.
- Just being here is a risk.

12:07.880 --> 12:08.680
But...

12:08.710 --> 12:12.650
Trust me... the games here
are not for nice, sweet girls.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.180
Weeeeeeeeeeeee!

12:15.220 --> 12:17.390
I'm riding a giant bunny!

12:23.130 --> 12:24.860
Oh my God!

12:27.330 --> 12:29.830
I'm gonna try the balls of pain.

12:29.870 --> 12:31.400
- N-no, no way!

12:31.440 --> 12:34.140
If you get hit by one of
those things, it hurts bad.

12:34.170 --> 12:38.510
I'm not scared...
I'm a risk taker.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.480
- Woop!
- Wait.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.710
Risk taker? Really?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.880
She's not supposed
to be laughin' on the bunny!

12:45.920 --> 12:49.920
Well whaddaya want me to do?!

12:52.220 --> 12:53.660
All right, when you hear the buzzer,

12:53.690 --> 12:57.030
you run to this side, grab a
ring, run it back over there.

12:57.060 --> 13:00.530
Your goal is to get three rings
on the peg in thirty seconds.

13:00.570 --> 13:03.400
Easy. Let's go!

13:03.440 --> 13:05.570
You realize those big forty pound balls.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.510
Are gonna be
swinging back and forth, right?

13:08.540 --> 13:12.480
Risk! It's all about risk.

13:12.510 --> 13:18.280
- Five seconds...
- ...Four, three, two, one...

13:19.650 --> 13:22.550
Okay... I got this...
I got this...

13:22.590 --> 13:24.520
No I don't...
I don't know...

13:24.560 --> 13:27.760
Whoa, that was close...
All right, here I go... here I...

13:27.790 --> 13:32.030
- Ooh.
- Loser.

13:32.060 --> 13:36.000
- Oh.
- You all right?

13:36.030 --> 13:40.270
Yes. That game is impossible.

13:40.310 --> 13:45.310
Ooo, rings!

13:56.690 --> 13:59.450
I'm goin' again.

14:07.550 --> 14:09.380
You ask me one more question,

14:09.420 --> 14:12.330
I'll rip that pencil outta your hand
and stick it right in your neck!

14:14.050 --> 14:16.890
- Good job Tori.
- Yeah? You liked it?

14:16.920 --> 14:20.780
No. But you are getting
less terrible.

14:21.370 --> 14:25.730
- Wow. Thanks.
- You're still playing The Scene too safely.

14:25.760 --> 14:29.230
- You're not taking risks.
- But I am so risky now!

14:29.270 --> 14:31.570
Last night I went to a crazy gorilla club.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.140
Oh and this morning I ate yogurt.

14:33.170 --> 14:36.240
That was two days past the "eat by" date!

14:36.280 --> 14:38.610
I am like a maniac!

14:38.640 --> 14:41.850
Good. You're learning
to be a risk taker.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.550
And that's why you're getting better.

14:43.580 --> 14:46.050
I still wanna know why you're
sitting in that Bucket of ice.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.320
- Yeah just tell us.
- C'mon tell us.

14:49.350 --> 14:52.260
I tried to milk a horse,

14:52.290 --> 14:55.590
and when I turned around, the horse
kicked me right in the toosh.

14:55.630 --> 14:57.270
- Tush.
- I say toosh.

14:58.530 --> 15:02.760
- Robbie's toosh is lop-sided.
- It is not!

15:02.800 --> 15:05.060
You know the left cheek
hangs lower than the right.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.470

Yes! And I stepped on a
rock and I fell down.

18:08.390 --> 18:12.960

rehearse for her audition.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.410
That's three nights in a row.

18:32.450 --> 18:35.170
I know she's bad, but does she
really need this much help?

18:36.820 --> 18:41.750
- He's teaching me about taking risks.
- Ohhhhhhhh.

18:41.790 --> 18:42.520
It's true.

club and beat the balls of pain.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.860
I didn't do the gorilla thing.

18:53.900 --> 18:58.900
- But I used the bathroom there.
- Sitting down?

18:58.940 --> 19:01.440
- I might have hovered.
- Ha.

19:02.500 --> 19:06.150
- I am a risk taker!
- Don't tell me, tell the gorilla.

19:06.180 --> 19:09.890

- That's my thing!

19:16.940 --> 19:20.220
All right, settle down!
