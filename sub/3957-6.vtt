WEBVTT

00:02.683 --> 00:06.123
Why is it all right for you to have
a boyfriend but not for me?

00:06.211 --> 00:09.389
So long as you live under my roof,
you live by my rules.

00:09.464 --> 00:10.744
Finn's got an admirer.

00:10.745 --> 00:14.344
Who would even send a love letter?
That is so stupid.

00:14.419 --> 00:17.424
Keep your voice down.
This is where I work.

00:17.533 --> 00:21.532
Don't tell me to keep my voice down.

00:21.892 --> 00:24.732
Either we're friends
or we're not friends.

00:24.733 --> 00:28.251
Maybe... I don't want
to be your friend.

00:28.252 --> 00:29.531
We are...

00:29.614 --> 00:31.233
Married!

00:31.293 --> 00:33.012
Can I tell you something?

00:33.013 --> 00:37.044
It was me who sent the letter
to Finn.

00:41.088 --> 00:43.727
Don't mention Friday to anyone.

00:43.992 --> 00:45.670
Why are you looking at me?

00:45.671 --> 00:47.032
I'm looking at everyone.

00:47.033 --> 00:50.591
Don't tell your brothers,
don't tell your sisters,

00:50.592 --> 00:52.192
don't even tell knobheads
from school.

00:52.193 --> 00:53.271
At the end of the day...

00:53.314 --> 00:54.593
'Whatever, Chop.

00:54.594 --> 00:58.592
'Dear Diary, the fight for Finn's
delicious heart has begun.'

00:59.755 --> 01:01.713
'In the red corner, Chloe.

01:01.714 --> 01:04.552
'Seen here looking at Finn
like a black widow

01:04.553 --> 01:07.634
'sizing up how much Gaviscon
she's going to need

01:07.635 --> 01:09.513
'after eating him whole.

01:09.514 --> 01:13.033
'In the blue corner, see me.

01:13.034 --> 01:15.313
'Finn is so out of my league

01:15.314 --> 01:19.193
;that no-one would ever even suspect
I liked him.

01:19.409 --> 01:21.528
'Nay, loved him.

01:21.529 --> 01:25.529
'But since we had had that amazing
heart-to-heart at the party,

01:26.089 --> 01:29.568
'my odds have shortened massively.'

01:29.569 --> 01:31.647
This Friday is between
the six of us.

01:31.648 --> 01:35.649
Put it in the vault, people.
Lock it in the fucking vault.

01:36.729 --> 01:40.729
'We've even developed
a secret mode of communication.'

01:47.849 --> 01:50.227
'I had to use every ounce
of my willpower

01:50.294 --> 01:52.733
'not to move his hand over
just a few inches

01:52.734 --> 01:55.335
'and ask him to write out
all of War And Peace.'

01:55.336 --> 01:58.374
Here you are,
check out this bad ass!

01:58.375 --> 02:00.334
Oh, my God!

02:00.335 --> 02:03.494
Hi, Rae. Hi, Chloe.
Hi, everyone.

02:03.495 --> 02:06.094
Hi.

02:06.095 --> 02:07.695
What are you doing here?

02:07.696 --> 02:11.695
I'm booking the function room
for Saturday.

02:11.895 --> 02:15.694
Oh, Rae's friends.
This is my new husband, Karim.

02:15.695 --> 02:16.934
Congratulations.

02:16.935 --> 02:18.414
Pleased to meet you.

02:18.415 --> 02:21.213
We're getting the marriage blessed
and then we're gonna come here

02:21.214 --> 02:22.773
and have the reception afterwards.

02:22.774 --> 02:25.173
- You're all invited, of course.
- They can't, they're busy.

02:25.174 --> 02:27.895
We're not busy at all.
That's wonderful, Mrs Earl.

02:27.896 --> 02:29.454
Congratulations.

02:29.455 --> 02:33.295
Thank you, Chloe. But actually,
my name is Mrs Bouchtat now.

02:33.296 --> 02:34.814
Oh, Bouchtat.

02:34.815 --> 02:37.854
Does that mean
your name is Rae Bouchtat?

02:37.855 --> 02:40.255
- No, it doesn't.
- This is so exciting.

02:40.256 --> 02:44.255
We can use it as a wind-down session
after the rave.

02:46.575 --> 02:47.934
What did you say?

02:47.935 --> 02:51.094
Nothing.

02:51.095 --> 02:54.455
Did she say "rave"?

03:33.186 --> 03:35.946
How many calories a minute
does high-intensity sex burn?

03:35.947 --> 03:37.025
18.

03:37.026 --> 03:39.986
How long would I have to have sex to
burn off a six-pack of Wagon Wheels?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.945
- Jammy or normal?
- Jammy.

03:41.950 --> 03:44.309
Jammy Wagon Wheels are 167 cal.

03:44.310 --> 03:46.069
Six are 1,002.

03:46.070 --> 03:48.108
18 cal a minute...
Just under an hour.

03:48.109 --> 03:52.110
Ooh! Maybe I should get Dr Nick
to cancel his one o'clock.

03:52.590 --> 03:55.148
Hand jobs are supposed to be
exhausting too.

03:55.149 --> 03:57.788
I've heard you sometimes have to
change arms halfway through.

03:57.789 --> 04:01.790
So what you're saying is
I could essentially sex myself thin.

04:02.150 --> 04:06.068
Well, you could eat two roast
dinners, have sex for an hour,

04:06.069 --> 04:09.988
throw in a couple of hand jobs and
you'd actually be in minus calories.

04:09.989 --> 04:11.870
What is not to like?
Where do I sign?

04:11.942 --> 04:13.340
What day is it?

04:13.341 --> 04:17.341
It's Wednesday, 21 August 1996.

04:20.380 --> 04:23.540
'Dear Diary, I want to be
more like Rae.

04:23.541 --> 04:27.541
'Then my life would be
full of things like boys.

04:29.181 --> 04:32.739
'Rather than things like
how many calories things contain.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.819
'And how to lose those calories.'

04:40.301 --> 04:43.259
I want you to try to drink
at least two of these a day.

04:43.260 --> 04:44.459
They taste like tar.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.499
Tix, your BMI has dropped again.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.219
It's dropped significantly.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.619
You've become in danger
of falling very ill, OK?

04:50.620 --> 04:54.621
There is a risk of organ failure,
of heart problems, hormone problems,

04:54.701 --> 04:58.060
problems with your brain.

04:58.061 --> 05:00.019
Angie says you're refusing solids.

05:00.020 --> 05:01.779
I don't like people watching me eat.

05:01.780 --> 05:03.581
You are on supervised eating, Tix.

05:03.582 --> 05:07.581
It's her job to watch you eat.

05:07.621 --> 05:09.579
If you don't start eating
in the next few days,

05:09.580 --> 05:11.101
if your weight doesn't stabilise,

05:11.102 --> 05:15.101
I'll have to put you
on a tube feed, Tix.

05:15.981 --> 05:19.061
I really, really don't want
to have to do that.

05:19.062 --> 05:20.420
Do you understand?

05:20.421 --> 05:24.421
Yeah.

05:27.861 --> 05:31.861
So how have you been
since our last session?

05:33.141 --> 05:37.141
Are you scared?

05:37.661 --> 05:41.661
You have to let go, Tix.

05:42.101 --> 05:45.460
It's OK to lose control... sometimes.

05:45.461 --> 05:47.141
You don't have to worry
all the time,

05:47.142 --> 05:50.700
you don't have to count calories.

05:50.701 --> 05:54.701
Tell me something
that makes you feel good.

05:55.621 --> 05:58.500
Anything.

05:58.501 --> 05:59.580
Rae.

05:59.581 --> 06:00.780
Rae, great.

06:00.781 --> 06:04.781
So, supposing I set up a date
between you and Rae for dinner.

06:08.341 --> 06:12.140
She'd like that. I'd like that.

06:12.141 --> 06:13.701
It would have to be Rae, though.

06:13.702 --> 06:16.900
Hm.

06:16.901 --> 06:19.301
Because I said no
and that means no.

06:19.302 --> 06:21.460
But everyone's going.

06:21.461 --> 06:25.461
It's not like an illegal rave anyway.
It's more like a big dance event.

06:25.701 --> 06:26.940
You're not going.

06:26.941 --> 06:30.941
I know sometimes I tell you to do
things and you ignore me, right,

06:31.301 --> 06:33.819
well, this isn't going to be
one of those times.

06:33.820 --> 06:36.099
Anyway, what do you think
Kester would say

06:36.100 --> 06:38.301
if you told him you were going
to a rave?

06:38.302 --> 06:41.620
He'd say, "Go for it." I know Kester.

06:41.621 --> 06:45.220
And he would love the idea
of me enjoying myself.

06:45.221 --> 06:46.981
Cos he's not a complete ball-breaker.

06:46.982 --> 06:48.820
Thank you, I'm not deaf.

06:48.821 --> 06:52.821
Right, how does it look?

06:59.021 --> 07:00.420
Oh, great!

07:00.421 --> 07:04.421
I look like a cross between a
profiterole and a prolapsed colon.

07:05.421 --> 07:09.421
I love it, I absolutely love it.

07:12.621 --> 07:14.620
Mmm.

07:14.621 --> 07:16.140
Oh!

07:16.141 --> 07:17.741
Well, what about this one?

07:17.742 --> 07:19.100
It's too expensive.

07:19.101 --> 07:20.940
But I love it.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.059
If everyone is going to be there,
I have to look nice.

07:24.060 --> 07:26.179
Right, Rae, when I say no
to something,

07:26.180 --> 07:27.899
it doesn't mean keep arguing,

07:27.900 --> 07:29.541
it means end of discussion!

07:32.581 --> 07:34.179
I think I'm going to be sick.

07:34.180 --> 07:35.581
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

07:40.701 --> 07:44.701
'You always wonder what it would be
like to sit in front of a doctor

07:44.741 --> 07:46.821
'and hear the worst possible news.

07:46.822 --> 07:50.740
'How you'd cope, how you'd feel.'

07:50.741 --> 07:53.141
Rae, I'm afraid you're going to have
to stop drinking alcohol.

07:53.142 --> 07:54.820
Why?

07:54.821 --> 07:57.139
The meds we switched you to,
some people feel nauseous

07:57.140 --> 07:58.979
if they drink on them,
especially at first.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.339
- Right, so it's nothing serious.
- What?

08:01.340 --> 08:03.099
I want to go back to the old ones.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.179
No, I wasn't happy with the SSRIs.
You said they make you feel drowsy.

08:06.180 --> 08:08.299
I'd rather feel drowsy
than feel sick.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.901
No, it's fine,
she can just give up the booze.

08:10.902 --> 08:13.380
- This is bullshit.
- Rae!

08:13.381 --> 08:15.579
We can review your meds
in the next few weeks,

08:15.580 --> 08:19.581
but changing them or stopping them
now is not a good idea.

08:21.301 --> 08:25.301
Oh, Dr Nick, I meant to say.
I got married last week.

08:25.501 --> 08:27.101
Oh, wow, great, congratulations!

08:27.102 --> 08:29.500
Are we all right?

08:29.501 --> 08:33.140
Yeah.

08:33.140 --> 08:37.140
Ohh!

08:39.981 --> 08:43.381
'When you're sick, you don't belong
to yourself any more.

08:43.381 --> 08:45.340
'You don't get a say.

08:45.341 --> 08:49.341
'Every doctor is another parent,
every ward another classroom,

08:49.781 --> 08:53.781
'every pill another piece of their
bollocks that you have to swallow.'

'because of my pills and no rave
because of my cowbag of a mum.'

09:26.581 --> 09:30.581
'You never know,
maybe the rave would be shit.

09:45.742 --> 09:49.460
Rae, what are you thinking about?

09:49.461 --> 09:51.860
I'm thinking...

09:51.861 --> 09:55.099
how I'm going to tell you
that you smell of BO.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.381
I'm sure you'll find something
to say.

09:58.741 --> 10:02.741
Oh, shit! There's Kendo.

10:02.821 --> 10:04.060
Who's Kendo?

10:04.061 --> 10:06.700
Some twat dealer from Dalehead.

10:06.701 --> 10:08.021
Do I look all right?

10:08.022 --> 10:12.021
What do you mean, "Do I look all
right"? He's a scumbag.

10:13.901 --> 10:15.300
All right, ladies?

10:15.301 --> 10:16.541
All right, Chopper?

10:16.542 --> 10:17.780
All right, Kendo?

10:17.781 --> 10:21.781
Tell your fuckin' brother I'm gonna
smash his face in when I see him

10:23.501 --> 10:25.701
I'm only joking.
How is the cunt?

10:25.702 --> 10:28.820
He's all right.

10:28.821 --> 10:30.459
Do you want some pills for Friday?

10:30.460 --> 10:31.421
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

10:31.422 --> 10:35.421
Drop round tomorrow and I'll see
what I can do for you.

10:35.581 --> 10:39.581
In a bit.
See you later, girls.

10:43.301 --> 10:46.260
What are you getting drugs for?

10:46.261 --> 10:49.701
- It's a rave, innit?
- Finn, can I get a ride on
the back of your scooter?

10:49.702 --> 10:51.940
Yeah, course, no problem.

10:51.941 --> 10:54.179
There's room for you to all go
in the one car.

10:54.180 --> 10:55.421
What are you talking about?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.380
I'm not going.

10:57.381 --> 10:59.060
What?
Why?

10:59.061 --> 11:02.220
Is it because of your mum?

11:02.221 --> 11:03.939
I'm not going if Rae's not going.

11:03.940 --> 11:05.379
I'm not going if Rae's not going.

11:05.380 --> 11:08.581
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.
No-one is backing out of this.

11:08.582 --> 11:09.940
Rae?

11:09.941 --> 11:13.941
Come here.

11:14.781 --> 11:18.060
Rae, what's going on?

11:18.061 --> 11:19.980
My mum won't let me go.

11:19.981 --> 11:22.500
Rae, listen to everyone.

11:22.501 --> 11:24.340
You've got to go.

11:24.341 --> 11:28.099
Right, you're always being reminded
about how sick you were.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.901
It's just making you worse.

11:29.902 --> 11:33.901
You even said yourself,
you're getting better.

11:36.861 --> 11:39.980
You know,
you and Finn are getting close.

11:39.981 --> 11:41.740
Yeah. He's a good laugh.

11:41.741 --> 11:44.980
Does he ever mention me?

11:44.981 --> 11:46.059
I don't know really.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.459
What do you reckon he'd do
if I tried to kiss him?

11:48.460 --> 11:50.261
How should I know what he'd do?

11:50.262 --> 11:53.660
Can you imagine sleeping with him?

11:53.661 --> 11:54.981
You'd need a fucking bib.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.540
That's disgusting.

11:57.541 --> 11:59.859
It's what you said about Jarvis
Cocker last week.

11:59.860 --> 12:01.899
- It's still disgusting.
- Well, you're disgusting.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.861
Right, I'm off. Rae, come round
to mine tomorrow if you want.

12:04.862 --> 12:06.020
Why?

12:06.021 --> 12:09.061
Because I've got some really crap
reggae I want to show you.

12:09.062 --> 12:13.061
And you can give me
some personal hygiene tips.

12:20.301 --> 12:22.280
'Round one to me.'

12:23.145 --> 12:26.864
Rachel, come name...
Special bird for you.

12:26.942 --> 12:27.981
No, thanks.

12:27.982 --> 12:31.982
Oh, Rae, come and name a bird.

12:32.582 --> 12:34.301
Oh!

12:34.302 --> 12:37.341
Ah! What's the matter with you?

12:37.342 --> 12:40.060
You're not still in a mood, are you,
about that rave?

12:40.061 --> 12:41.280
I'd like to see Kester's face

12:41.313 --> 12:43.952
if he thought I was letting you go
to a rave.

12:43.953 --> 12:46.994
Stop pretending like you know him.
I already told you,

12:46.995 --> 12:49.433
he wants me to have a life.

12:49.434 --> 12:52.673
Are you going to name this bird
or not?

12:52.674 --> 12:54.752
You know, they might not even
like each other

12:54.753 --> 12:56.992
and you've got them
all cooped up together.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.832
- Well, a lot of us have to live like that, so...
- It doesn't make it right.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.752
You shouldn't cage up wild animals.

13:01.824 --> 13:02.905
Just name the bird!

13:02.906 --> 13:06.905
Fine!

13:08.945 --> 13:10.744
He's called Mandela.

13:10.745 --> 13:12.184
Mandela.

13:12.185 --> 13:14.944
That's like Nelson.

13:14.945 --> 13:18.945
I like.

13:24.265 --> 13:26.025
'So are you go to
the rave tomorrow?'

13:26.026 --> 13:27.824
It doesn't look like it.

13:27.825 --> 13:29.145
Will you go out with me?

13:29.146 --> 13:30.464
Where?

13:30.465 --> 13:32.663
'In the hospital. A dinner date.'

13:32.664 --> 13:35.103
I'm going to try
and have some proper food.

13:35.104 --> 13:37.385
'Kester says I need
to lose control.'

13:37.386 --> 13:39.944
Oh, I love Kester for saying that.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.464
How do I lose control?

13:42.465 --> 13:46.264
Do something that you've always
wanted to do,

13:46.265 --> 13:50.265
but you've been too scared of.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.305
Can you think of anything?

13:53.306 --> 13:57.305
Maybe.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.504
Hiya, Tix. Hiya.

14:02.505 --> 14:03.984
What are you up to?

14:03.985 --> 14:07.985
A bit of admin.

14:10.865 --> 14:13.225
Do you fancy going to the lake
with me later?

14:13.226 --> 14:14.584
Me?
Yeah.

14:14.585 --> 14:16.144
OK. Cool. What time?

14:16.145 --> 14:18.185
- Four-ish?
- Four-ish, OK, cool.

14:25.025 --> 14:27.904
'Even his house was a bit sexy.

14:27.905 --> 14:29.464
'Oh, God, stop!

14:29.465 --> 14:33.465
'No craziness. Stop the craziness.

14:33.825 --> 14:35.544
'I'm breathing too deep.

14:35.545 --> 14:37.544
'I'm hyperventilating.

14:37.545 --> 14:41.264
'Put your hands on something flat.'

14:41.265 --> 14:45.265
I pulled a hamstring.
Just stretching it out.

14:45.665 --> 14:46.945
Come up to my room.

14:46.946 --> 14:50.945
If my dad sees you,
he'll bend your ear for weeks.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.744
'His bedroom?

14:53.745 --> 14:55.384
'My God!

14:55.385 --> 14:59.385
'This was it.

14:59.705 --> 15:03.384
'About to enter the lion's den.'

15:12.866 --> 15:14.505
Hi.

15:16.025 --> 15:19.544
'Round two.'

15:19.545 --> 15:22.823
Well, I didn't want to miss out
on listening to some reggae.

15:22.824 --> 15:24.223
Yeah, cos you love reggae.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.465
I don't particularly like
any type of music best.

15:26.466 --> 15:28.624
I just like good music.

15:28.625 --> 15:32.185
You know.

15:34.505 --> 15:35.785
Finn, I love this song.

15:35.786 --> 15:38.224
Who do you like best, Chloe?

15:38.225 --> 15:41.025
Morrissey, or the lead singer
of the Smiths?

15:41.026 --> 15:44.185
Well, it depends what mood I'm in.

15:45.025 --> 15:46.424
What?

15:46.425 --> 15:50.425
'In your face, Chloe!'

15:50.625 --> 15:51.665
Right, who wants a beer?

15:51.666 --> 15:54.024
- I will.
- Rae?

15:54.025 --> 15:55.865
- No, I'm all right.
- Serious?

15:55.866 --> 15:59.104
Come on, Rea. Don't be boring.

15:59.105 --> 16:03.105
Don't be a weirdo.

16:15.505 --> 16:17.823
'I can't believe I asked a boy out.

16:17.824 --> 16:20.583
'Finally, I'm going to be able to
talk to Rea about kissing

16:20.584 --> 16:22.545
'and sex things and flirting
and love.'

16:23.425 --> 16:27.425
'Just like a normal girl.

16:33.385 --> 16:35.304
'Maybe I can be normal.'

17:03.185 --> 17:07.185
So what about Rae, then?
Is your mum not letting you go?

17:07.265 --> 17:08.784
It's complicated.

17:08.785 --> 17:10.502
It would be shit if you don't come.

17:10.503 --> 17:12.782
Well, the rest of the gang
are still going.

17:12.784 --> 17:14.423
You're still going
to have a good time.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.905
The rest of the gang would fall
apart if you're not there.

17:16.906 --> 17:20.464
You are the gang.
No, I mean that, Rae.

17:20.464 --> 17:22.863
Everyone else has got
too much stuff going on.

17:22.864 --> 17:24.744
You're the most, you know, normal.

17:24.746 --> 17:26.584
That's bollocks.

17:26.585 --> 17:28.944
It's true!

17:28.945 --> 17:31.705
Anyway, you've got to go. I won't
take no for an answer because...

17:31.706 --> 17:34.424
Because what?

18:04.705 --> 18:06.945
- Are you OK?
- No, I just, um...

18:06.946 --> 18:09.184
What's up?

18:09.185 --> 18:10.784
I don't feel very well.

18:10.785 --> 18:14.785
Well, d'you want me to see
if my dad will give you a lift home?

18:16.905 --> 18:19.744
'Oh, God! No vomitorium!'

18:19.745 --> 18:21.184
You'll like this.

18:21.185 --> 18:24.545
I got really bladdered
at a Status Quo concert once.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.825
'Round two to Chloe.'

18:41.985 --> 18:43.504
'Just relax.

18:43.505 --> 18:46.264
'He's just a boy.

18:46.265 --> 18:49.264
'Rae would say something funny.

18:49.265 --> 18:51.065
'Maybe I should tell a joke?

18:51.066 --> 18:52.224
'No.

18:52.225 --> 18:54.864
'Don't tell any jokes.

18:54.865 --> 18:56.904
'Just make conversation.'

18:56.905 --> 19:00.905
What do you want to talk about?

19:01.705 --> 19:02.864
Ducks.

19:02.865 --> 19:06.064
They're one of my favourite things,
ducks.

19:06.065 --> 19:09.385
I mean, when you think about a duck,
they're just so...

19:09.386 --> 19:10.464
chilled out.

19:10.465 --> 19:13.303
They're not chilled out.
I've seen them fight.

19:13.304 --> 19:15.463
Yeah, but once they've done
flapping their wings

19:15.464 --> 19:16.825
and splashing about and stuff,

19:16.826 --> 19:20.825
they just go back to being
so... chilled out.

19:22.145 --> 19:24.025
- Hey, d'you know what we should do?
- What?

19:24.026 --> 19:26.064
We should become ducks.

19:26.065 --> 19:29.025
We'd go into the pond.

19:34.425 --> 19:37.345
Danny, no,
they'll see you from the windows.

19:37.346 --> 19:41.345
I fear nothing.

19:44.945 --> 19:48.584
Come on, then.

19:48.585 --> 19:52.224
'Lose control.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.304
'Let go.

19:54.305 --> 19:56.464
'Lose control.

19:56.465 --> 19:59.144
'Let go.

19:59.145 --> 20:00.424
'Lose control.

20:00.425 --> 20:01.704
'Let go.

20:01.705 --> 20:03.664
'Lose control.

20:03.665 --> 20:04.824
'Let go.

20:04.825 --> 20:08.825
'Lose control.'

20:10.465 --> 20:14.465
Come on.

20:24.265 --> 20:28.224
Oh, shit!

20:28.225 --> 20:31.104
'Fucking pills! Fucking doctors!

20:31.105 --> 20:35.105
'How was I supposed to compete for
Finn when I couldn't go anywhere,

20:36.505 --> 20:40.505
'couldn't do anything?

20:43.345 --> 20:46.985
'At least there was one adult
on the planet who understood.'

20:46.986 --> 20:48.984
It's a load of crap.

20:48.985 --> 20:50.384
I mean, I'm 16.

20:50.385 --> 20:52.424
Everyone else is going.

20:52.425 --> 20:55.903
And she's all like, "Oh, you can't go
because you're different.

20:55.904 --> 20:59.905
"You shouldn't be exposing yourself
to that kind of situation."

21:00.185 --> 21:02.584
She even used you in an argument.

21:02.585 --> 21:05.104
"Oh, think of what Kester would say."

21:05.105 --> 21:07.104
What did she think I'd say?

21:07.105 --> 21:10.664
She said that you would think
it was a bad idea.

21:10.665 --> 21:13.743
But she doesn't know about everything
we talk about in here.

21:13.744 --> 21:16.503
She doesn't know about
all the work we've done

21:16.504 --> 21:18.503
on me being brave and confident.

21:18.504 --> 21:21.585
She just reminds me
that I'm ill all the time.

21:21.586 --> 21:23.424
I agree with your mum.

21:23.425 --> 21:26.624
I think it's a terrible idea.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.663
You don't think that.

21:27.664 --> 21:29.623
You're recovering
from a serious illness.

21:29.624 --> 21:30.865
If you'd broken your leg,

21:30.866 --> 21:34.865
would you try and run a marathon
two months later?

21:36.425 --> 21:38.583
Do you still think I'm a mess, then?

21:38.584 --> 21:40.343
I don't think you're a mess.

21:40.344 --> 21:42.825
I think you need
to take care of yourself.

21:42.826 --> 21:46.825
I need to take myself?

21:49.905 --> 21:52.184
Who were you arguing with?

21:52.185 --> 21:54.984
Last week in the car park.

21:54.985 --> 21:57.184
I saw you.

21:57.185 --> 22:00.104
Was it your wife?

22:00.105 --> 22:02.984
How am I supposed to listen
to someone

22:02.985 --> 22:05.864
whose life is a bigger mess
than mine?

22:05.865 --> 22:08.703
What is even the point
of these sessions, seriously?

22:08.704 --> 22:10.703
To find out what pushed you
over the edge

22:10.704 --> 22:12.543
and to stop it from happening again.

22:12.544 --> 22:14.183
Oh, you're always asking questions.

22:14.184 --> 22:16.585
"Why did you hurt yourself?
Why did you go crazy?"

22:16.586 --> 22:19.664
Sometimes there is no why.
I just did.

22:19.665 --> 22:23.425
And being here and being asked
about it every bloody day

22:23.426 --> 22:25.424
is what's keeping it alive.

22:25.425 --> 22:27.305
Look, I know this is painful...

22:27.306 --> 22:31.305
Are you even listening to me?

22:34.305 --> 22:37.384
I was bored.

22:37.385 --> 22:39.824
I was lonely.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.504
I had no mates.

22:41.505 --> 22:45.505
Now I'm finally popular.

22:46.105 --> 22:50.105
And you just want to make me
feel different again.

22:52.865 --> 22:54.943
I don't want to come here any more.

22:54.944 --> 22:56.823
You are not obliged to come here,
Rae.

22:56.824 --> 22:59.023
But I think it would be a bad idea.

22:59.024 --> 23:01.983
I think we're making some real...
progress here. I think...

23:01.984 --> 23:04.905
What would happen if I walked out
of the door right now

23:04.906 --> 23:07.864
and never came back?

23:07.865 --> 23:11.865
Aren't you going to try and say
something insightful to make me stay?

23:13.385 --> 23:16.464
Do you think perhaps...

23:16.465 --> 23:19.503
..your anger is born
out of frustration with yourself?

23:19.504 --> 23:23.505
That you're angry and frustrated
with yourself for being ill?

23:26.105 --> 23:30.105
You see, that is not something
you are entirely responsible for.

24:11.385 --> 24:15.385
I don't half bloody love you,
beastie.

25:09.289 --> 25:12.328
'Friday, the 23rd of August.

25:12.335 --> 25:16.335
'Dear Diary...

25:19.815 --> 25:23.815
'Oh, bollocks to it!'

25:28.055 --> 25:32.055
Morning.

25:38.095 --> 25:42.095
Morning.

25:45.015 --> 25:49.015
What?

26:19.015 --> 26:22.494
What happened?

26:22.495 --> 26:24.454
What happened?

26:24.455 --> 26:27.295
Someone let all the birds
out of the cage.

26:27.802 --> 26:29.480
That's what happened.

26:29.481 --> 26:31.080
Who did?

26:31.177 --> 26:35.177
Why would someone do such a thing?
I don't know.

26:35.337 --> 26:38.017
Maybe you could tell me
why someone would do such a thing.

26:38.018 --> 26:40.336
Oh, my...!

26:40.337 --> 26:42.377
Do you want to tell me
why you did it?

26:42.378 --> 26:45.256
Well, I didn't know that they'd die.

26:45.257 --> 26:48.177
Well, what did you think they'd do?
Fly back to the Bahamas?

26:48.178 --> 26:50.616
Check in at the local RSPB?

26:50.617 --> 26:53.016
Karim is in bits.

26:53.017 --> 26:56.255
He built this because he doesn't
know many people here.

26:56.256 --> 27:00.215
He wanted a project, something nice,
so he didn't feel so trapped.

27:00.216 --> 27:02.295
I did it because they
shouldn't be in a cage.

27:02.296 --> 27:03.935
They're birds, they're not toys.

27:03.936 --> 27:06.057
No, you did it to get back at me

27:06.058 --> 27:09.416
for not letting you go to the rave,
didn't you?

27:09.417 --> 27:12.935
Well, is it any wonder I won't let
you go when you do things like this?

27:12.936 --> 27:14.737
When you behave like a mental case?

27:14.738 --> 27:17.256
Don't call me a mental case.

27:17.257 --> 27:20.015
But... you know what I meant.
Don't you ever

27:20.016 --> 27:21.737
call me a fuckin' mental case.

27:21.738 --> 27:24.936
Don't talk to me like that, Rae.
I'm your mum.

27:24.937 --> 27:28.015
I meant you need to start
behaving like an adult

27:28.016 --> 27:30.655
instead of behaving like a child.
Yeah?

27:30.656 --> 27:34.657
Well, maybe you need to start
behaving like my mum instead of

27:34.817 --> 27:38.817
behaving like a twat.

27:40.137 --> 27:42.936
Oh, I'm sorry, Rae.

27:42.937 --> 27:46.937
Save it.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.096
Where are you going?

28:01.097 --> 28:03.176
I don't know, anywhere.

28:03.177 --> 28:05.176
Away from you, away from him.

28:05.177 --> 28:07.737
Rae, don't go.
Let's talk about this.

28:07.738 --> 28:10.696
I'm really sorry.

28:10.697 --> 28:13.976
Why don't you slap me
and then we're even?

28:13.977 --> 28:16.256
I don't want to slap you.

28:16.257 --> 28:20.257
I don't even want to look at you.

28:32.257 --> 28:36.255
'I'd always known I'd have to run
away from home at some point.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.215
'I'd always planned
that I don't stop at Chloe's.

28:39.216 --> 28:42.617
'We'd be like sisters.
I'd have a normal family.'

28:45.977 --> 28:48.656
'But things change.'

29:11.497 --> 29:15.497
There you go.

29:15.617 --> 29:19.617
Tea makes everything all right.

29:20.257 --> 29:23.217
I reckon it'll be all right,
you know, in a couple of days.

29:23.218 --> 29:27.217
When you've both had some space
or whatever.

29:28.017 --> 29:29.737
Thanks for letting me stop.

29:29.738 --> 29:31.376
It's all right.

29:31.377 --> 29:34.335
My dad's ironing the sheets
for the spare room as we speak.

29:34.336 --> 29:35.777
Oh, please don't let him do that.

29:35.778 --> 29:39.096
I wouldn't try and stop him.

29:39.097 --> 29:40.615
So what time's the rave?

29:40.616 --> 29:42.415
We'll probably set off
in about an hour.

29:42.416 --> 29:44.137
Why, are you thinking of coming?

29:44.138 --> 29:48.136
No. No, I'm not.

29:48.137 --> 29:50.135
It would mess up all the lifts
and stuff anyway.

29:50.136 --> 29:52.817
Would it bollocks, no! I'll tell
Chloe to jump in with Chop.

29:52.818 --> 29:56.817
And you can get on the scooter
with me.

30:02.324 --> 30:04.762
'I can't even dip my toe
in a pond.

30:04.763 --> 30:08.282
'I can't even lose control enough
to get my feet wet.

30:08.283 --> 30:09.602
'I'll never be normal.

30:09.603 --> 30:13.162
'I'll never be able to talk to Rae
about kissing and flirting and love.

30:13.532 --> 30:14.813
'I'll never be like...'

30:15.051 --> 30:18.016
- Rae?
- It's me.

30:18.407 --> 30:20.226
What are you doing in here?

30:20.380 --> 30:21.659
Hiding.

30:21.660 --> 30:23.580
Why, what are you doing in here?

30:23.581 --> 30:26.459
Hiding.

30:26.460 --> 30:30.460
I thought you'd be getting ready
your big date with Rae.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.619
I'm not going.

30:33.620 --> 30:37.620
Please don't try
and convince me to go.

30:37.820 --> 30:41.820
I once treated a young boy,
he was about seven years old.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.018
He used to pull down on his
testicles whenever he was upset.

30:46.019 --> 30:50.020
I mean really yank down,
it was truly eye-watering to behold.

30:51.340 --> 30:55.340
Then one day,
I asked him a difficult question.

30:55.940 --> 30:59.940
He pulled down so hard upon them
that he had to go to hospital.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.339
That's crazy.

31:03.340 --> 31:06.038
You'd be surprised what lengths
people will go to

31:06.073 --> 31:07.394
not to face what's real

31:07.395 --> 31:10.673
and painful inside them.

31:10.674 --> 31:13.233
But then, that's what my job is.

31:13.234 --> 31:16.153
I'm essentially a torturer.

31:16.154 --> 31:18.594
This is where you say
that I'm not a torturer,

31:18.595 --> 31:21.393
that I'm actually quite lovely.

31:21.394 --> 31:25.193
My methods of torture
are asking you to trust people.

31:25.194 --> 31:27.513
Asking you to lose control.

31:27.514 --> 31:31.514
But if I'd been treated the way
you have been treated by people...

31:32.594 --> 31:34.112
..I'd want to sit in a toilet

31:34.113 --> 31:36.714
and hide away from
the rest of the world as well.

31:36.715 --> 31:40.713
You are sitting in a toilet.

31:40.714 --> 31:42.554
It's really quite nice, actually.

31:42.555 --> 31:45.793
I can see why you and Rae
hang out here.

31:45.794 --> 31:48.913
I do trust people, you know.

31:48.914 --> 31:50.553
I trust Rae.

31:50.554 --> 31:54.554
Well, then maybe you should
have dinner with her.

33:48.034 --> 33:50.353
Are you all right?

33:50.354 --> 33:54.313
Listen, try and have a good night.
Enjoy yourself.

33:54.314 --> 33:56.793
Er, what's going on with you two?

33:56.794 --> 33:58.952
What do you mean?
You look like a couple.

33:58.953 --> 34:02.714
Come on, Chloe, we look like
a better couple than they do.

34:25.434 --> 34:28.033
I've got one for everyone.

34:28.034 --> 34:31.313
You fucking know this, come on.

34:31.313 --> 34:33.592
Finn?
No, I'm all right.

34:33.594 --> 34:35.473
Chloe?
No way.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.192
What are you doing?
Taking a pill.

34:37.193 --> 34:39.831
What, you hate drugs.
You don't take drugs.

34:39.833 --> 34:41.431
You said there was one for everyone.

34:41.433 --> 34:42.873
Not for you, you're different.

34:42.875 --> 34:46.873
Why am I different?
Rae, are you in?

34:47.793 --> 34:50.599
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.

34:55.543 --> 34:57.722
What's the point in keeping
a diary

34:57.733 --> 35:00.294
when you're too scared
to even do anything?

35:00.295 --> 35:02.293
When your life is boring?

35:02.294 --> 35:06.294
When the only things you know are
how many calories things contain?

35:08.374 --> 35:12.374
And how to lose them?

35:39.934 --> 35:43.613
Oh, my God, Rae!
I can't believe you dropped a pill.

35:43.614 --> 35:47.573
Yeah, well, you're the one
that told me to chill.

35:47.574 --> 35:51.533
So, how's things going with Finn?

35:51.534 --> 35:52.733
OK.

35:52.734 --> 35:54.214
Are you staying at his tonight?

35:54.553 --> 35:56.031
Yeah.

35:56.032 --> 35:57.791
But it's a long story.

35:57.792 --> 36:00.391
But you like him?
What, Finn?

36:00.392 --> 36:03.511
No! We're just best mates.

36:03.512 --> 36:06.272
I really want to kiss him,
but I don't know...

36:06.273 --> 36:08.671
I think he likes someone else.

36:08.672 --> 36:10.911
Who?

36:10.912 --> 36:12.631
I'm not too sure.

36:12.632 --> 36:14.072
Has he said anything to you?

36:14.073 --> 36:15.111
No.

36:15.112 --> 36:19.112
Maybe I won't try then.

36:19.272 --> 36:21.551
Whoo!

36:21.552 --> 36:25.552
Archie, come here.

36:29.872 --> 36:33.551
If you were a bloke,
I'd shag your lights out.

36:33.552 --> 36:36.831
Yeah. And if I was a bloke,
I'd let you.

36:36.832 --> 36:38.311
Really?

36:38.312 --> 36:40.911
I fucking love you, Rae.

36:40.912 --> 36:44.912
Promise me we'll hang out
next year at college, yeah?

36:50.592 --> 36:54.592
Whoo!

37:24.752 --> 37:28.551
I know you.
Everyone knows me.

37:28.552 --> 37:31.231
You've got the fuckin' moves, girl.

37:31.232 --> 37:33.591
I love it. I love to dance.

37:33.592 --> 37:35.031
I just love it.

37:35.032 --> 37:38.751
Right, come dance with me.

37:38.752 --> 37:42.752
Have you got anything?

37:47.752 --> 37:50.271
I'm single, are you?

37:50.272 --> 37:52.991
Are you here with someone?

37:52.992 --> 37:55.911
No. I'm not single.

37:55.912 --> 37:59.912
You can be single if you want.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.271
Rae, Rae, come here.
Come here.

38:10.272 --> 38:12.070
What are you doing?
I'm talking to her.

38:12.071 --> 38:14.872
I'll bring her back in a second.
I just need to borrow her a minute.

38:14.873 --> 38:18.872
Bye.

38:25.552 --> 38:28.632
What are you doing with knobheads?
What are doing with Kendo?

38:28.633 --> 38:30.151
Are you crying?

38:30.152 --> 38:32.551
- I fuckin' love her.
- Who?

38:32.552 --> 38:34.911
Izzy, I fuckin' love her.

38:34.912 --> 38:36.351
Whoa!

38:36.352 --> 38:37.910
Why are you telling me this?

38:37.911 --> 38:41.632
Because you're the daddy. You know
everything. Tell me what to do.

38:41.633 --> 38:43.591
Oh!

38:43.592 --> 38:44.911
Tell her.

38:44.912 --> 38:48.912
Just go over there and tell her
and be happy.

38:48.992 --> 38:51.431
Yeah?

38:51.432 --> 38:55.432
Yeah.

39:02.152 --> 39:05.671
Bloody hell!

39:05.672 --> 39:08.471
Come on.

39:08.472 --> 39:12.472
Chop!

39:12.552 --> 39:14.592
Hey, Barney, have you seen Chop?

39:14.593 --> 39:15.911
Huh!

39:15.912 --> 39:19.912
Er, Chop!

39:21.432 --> 39:22.871
Chop!

39:22.872 --> 39:25.671
Jesus, Rae, I'm so fucked.

39:25.672 --> 39:27.231
Yeah.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.911
Me too.

39:28.912 --> 39:30.351
Um...

39:30.352 --> 39:32.551
where the fuck is he?

39:32.552 --> 39:35.391
That boy's a constant flight risk.

39:35.392 --> 39:38.151
Right, just leave it.

39:38.152 --> 39:40.592
Right? He'll come back when he's
ready.

39:40.593 --> 39:43.551
And... I need another drink.

39:43.552 --> 39:45.551
So come on.
So come on.

39:45.552 --> 39:47.112
Come on, let's go.

39:48.912 --> 39:52.912
Why are you laughing?

39:57.032 --> 39:59.271
No way, I'll chunder.

39:59.272 --> 40:03.272
Pussy!

40:05.032 --> 40:06.991
Right...

40:06.992 --> 40:09.791
I need to kiss him tonight, babes.
Who?

40:09.792 --> 40:12.831
I need to kiss him.

40:12.832 --> 40:14.671
I need to tell him.

40:14.672 --> 40:16.350
What...
He needs to know!

40:16.351 --> 40:17.952
What are you on about?
You're fucked.

40:17.953 --> 40:19.591
No.

40:19.592 --> 40:21.111
I'm all right.

40:21.112 --> 40:23.512
I need to kiss him and I need to
tell him.

40:23.513 --> 40:27.431
He needs to know!

40:27.432 --> 40:28.831
Finn?

40:28.832 --> 40:32.671
Piss off!

40:32.672 --> 40:34.351
Finn?

40:34.352 --> 40:38.352
Finn!

40:40.352 --> 40:44.352
Finn?

40:46.552 --> 40:50.552
No...

40:52.392 --> 40:54.991
Rae, what are you going? Rae?
No!

40:54.992 --> 40:58.992
Rae!

40:59.392 --> 41:00.671
Rae!

41:00.672 --> 41:04.672
Rae!

42:09.392 --> 42:11.831
How you feeling?

42:11.832 --> 42:13.631
Like twice-boiled shit.

42:13.632 --> 42:17.632
Can you remember anything
from last night?

42:20.112 --> 42:22.151
A little.

42:22.152 --> 42:24.671
Oh, I can't remember a thing.

42:24.672 --> 42:28.271
Oh... You're stopping at Finn's,
right?

42:28.272 --> 42:30.591
No, just take me home.

42:30.592 --> 42:34.592
What about your mum?
Ohhh...

42:59.832 --> 43:01.592
What the fuck?!

43:01.593 --> 43:02.871
Karim?

43:10.232 --> 43:11.470
You sure you want to go home?

43:12.673 --> 43:16.672
Yeah.

43:51.432 --> 43:55.432
'Dear Diary,
if tea makes everything better,

43:55.512 --> 43:57.751
'I need an ocean of it.

43:57.752 --> 44:00.071
'I need all the tea in China.

44:00.072 --> 44:03.271
'Sorry I haven't written for a while
but...

44:03.272 --> 44:06.271
'well, what do you expect?

44:06.272 --> 44:08.111
'I'm unreliable.

44:08.112 --> 44:09.431
'I'm a mess.

44:09.432 --> 44:13.432
'I'm mental.'

44:17.632 --> 44:20.632
Hello, Mandela.

44:39.712 --> 44:40.711
Hello?

44:40.712 --> 44:42.991
'Rae? It's Kester.

44:42.992 --> 44:44.631
'Look, it's about Tix.'

44:44.632 --> 44:47.391
Oh, shit. The meal. I missed it.

44:47.392 --> 44:49.032
Is she there? Can I speak to her?

44:49.033 --> 44:51.191
'No, it's... it's not...

44:51.192 --> 44:54.391
'She...'
What?

44:54.392 --> 44:57.351
'She collapsed this morning.'

44:57.352 --> 44:58.991
Is it serious?

44:58.992 --> 45:01.192
'How quickly can you get to
the hospital?'
