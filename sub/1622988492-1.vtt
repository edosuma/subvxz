WEBVTT

02:06.841 --> 02:08.843
And how are we today?

02:08.877 --> 02:11.814
You feeling better?

02:16.551 --> 02:17.586
Be good.

03:11.706 --> 03:13.475
£16.83, please.

03:13.508 --> 03:15.444
£32.28, please.

03:23.852 --> 03:25.187
- Hi, Jan.
- Hi, Jan.

03:25.219 --> 03:27.522
All right, Cath? Anne?

03:27.556 --> 03:29.592
Mam?

03:30.692 --> 03:33.562
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, love.

03:33.594 --> 03:35.865
I just knelt down
to try and light the fire.

03:35.897 --> 03:38.000
Couldn't get up again.

03:38.032 --> 03:41.603
As I was here,
I thought I'd have a little sit down.

03:41.637 --> 03:43.806
Oh! Quite comfy,
really.

03:43.838 --> 03:46.140
She looked
a goner to me.

03:46.174 --> 03:47.977
If I'd tried
to get her up,

03:48.009 --> 03:50.979
I'd have ended up
on the floor myself.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.949
So I said,
"Best get Jan."

03:53.981 --> 03:57.686
And I said, "Don't bother her.
She'll be at Tesco's."

03:57.718 --> 03:59.989
Co-op, Mam. I work at the Co-op.

04:00.021 --> 04:03.024
And how many times have I told
you to leave the fire to me?

04:03.057 --> 04:05.860
I hate for you to feel you
have to do everything for us.

04:05.894 --> 04:07.563
Rubbish.
All she's got

04:07.596 --> 04:09.865
is that useless lump, Brian,
to look after.

04:09.897 --> 04:12.200
She hasn't even got
the pigeons anymore.

04:12.234 --> 04:16.038
Besides, what's a daughter for if it's
not to look after her mam and dad?

04:34.790 --> 04:37.326
I told you before, son, if you
lived closer I could do it

04:37.358 --> 04:39.262
and you wouldn't need
to pay for a babysitter.

04:40.596 --> 04:42.831
All right. Bye-bye.

04:46.334 --> 04:48.202
State of my parents.

04:48.235 --> 04:51.005
Dad calls,
said Mam's had a fall.

04:51.038 --> 04:53.175
Dashed round
thinking she'd had a stroke.

04:53.208 --> 04:56.712
- She all right?
- Yeah. She's just had another funny turn.

04:56.745 --> 04:59.915
It'd be so much easier
if they moved in here with us.

04:59.947 --> 05:02.817
We got the room now Dennis
and Sasha have flown the nest.

05:02.850 --> 05:06.654
I know you and Dad under the same roof
might not be a bed of roses, but...

05:06.687 --> 05:09.891
Didn't use a glove in my day.
It was just spit, rub and shove.

05:11.793 --> 05:15.163
There was that time I lost
my watch up there, mind.

05:15.197 --> 05:16.264
Brian?

05:18.132 --> 05:19.734
I've won
the EuroMillions.

05:21.235 --> 05:23.271
I'm having an affair
with John the post.

05:23.305 --> 05:26.775
Absolutely bloody clueless.

05:26.807 --> 05:29.377
- I'm leaving you, Brian.
- I've seen it all now.

05:29.411 --> 05:30.913
What's for tea, love?

05:52.199 --> 05:54.036
I nearly
crashed my car earlier.

05:54.069 --> 05:56.672
Those wild ponies are down
off the mountain again.

05:56.704 --> 05:59.207
Aye. Lured by chips
and curry sauce.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.777
Cheer up, Gerwyn.
Might never happen.

06:02.810 --> 06:07.415
You mean you paying your bar tab?
I'd already drawn that conclusion.

06:07.449 --> 06:09.651
No more credit.

06:18.427 --> 06:20.129
I'm telling you, boys.

06:20.161 --> 06:23.698
Our horse, Sweet Gemma,
was in the race of her life.

06:23.732 --> 06:25.834
And you know what gave her
the edge? Her good breeding.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.703
Bona fide
thoroughbred she was.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.805
Coming round the far
bend, she's still going well.

06:29.838 --> 06:31.774
She's about four lengths
clear of the third horse.

06:31.807 --> 06:34.276
I'm already running
down to the front.

06:34.309 --> 06:36.178
And then I
lose sight of her.

06:36.211 --> 06:38.881
I think she's gone down.
My horse has fallen.

06:38.913 --> 06:41.783
And so I panic, and I'm fighting
my way down to the track.

06:41.817 --> 06:45.086
And there she is, Sweet Gemma,
giving it everything she's got,

06:45.120 --> 06:47.156
and she comes through
on the outside and wins!

06:48.857 --> 06:51.093
- I duck under the rails...
- Totally illegal.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.828
Totally illegal, and I run
across the track to congratulate her.

06:53.862 --> 06:55.963
She was my horse,
and she won!

06:57.331 --> 06:58.433
Haven't seen him
in here before.

06:58.466 --> 07:00.002
You gotta dream big.

07:00.035 --> 07:02.237
Howard Davies,
accountant-type.

07:02.269 --> 07:04.173
Used to drink
up the Cross Keys.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.709
Started coming in here
Thursdays after squash.

07:06.742 --> 07:08.477
Owns a racehorse, does he?

07:08.509 --> 07:12.247
Owned. Part of a syndicate.
Till it all went tits up.

07:12.279 --> 07:15.183
- What happened?
- He doesn't like to talk about that bit.

07:15.216 --> 07:16.951
Oh, aye.

07:16.985 --> 07:18.920
Word is, he almost
lost everything:

07:18.954 --> 07:21.090
pile of cash,
house, missus.

07:21.122 --> 07:23.125
Bitter's gone.

07:23.158 --> 07:25.127
Who's having
one more? Before we go?

07:34.136 --> 07:35.471
Six Stella, please.

07:41.442 --> 07:43.745
- Howard, is it?
- That's right.

07:45.947 --> 07:47.882
Owned a racehorse,
I gather?

07:47.915 --> 07:50.252
Couldn't help overhearing.

07:50.285 --> 07:52.421
- Must be an expensive business.
- What?

07:53.355 --> 07:54.490
To buy one.

07:55.923 --> 07:57.492
Well, let's see,

07:57.526 --> 08:00.028
Sheikh Omari just shelled out
16 million for French Over,

08:00.060 --> 08:02.163
winner of
the Welsh Grand National.

08:02.197 --> 08:04.031
Mind you, that was dollars,
not pounds,

08:04.064 --> 08:06.802
so it's more affordable
than you think.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.036
Bring them over
can you, please? Thanks.

08:09.069 --> 08:10.171
You've got arms,
haven't you?

08:21.048 --> 08:23.185
Gerwyn said
to put it on my slate.

09:44.131 --> 09:46.034
There's a spillage
in aisle six.

09:47.201 --> 09:49.004
It looks like
chicken korma.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.036
- What's for tea, love?
- Just starting on it now.

10:22.269 --> 10:23.438
Hello.

10:34.316 --> 10:36.485
You are not
gonna believe this.

10:36.518 --> 10:38.519
The goat's
got ringworm.

10:39.955 --> 10:43.057
And now this duck has got
bumblefoot like the others.

10:58.539 --> 11:03.211
Here, this fella's making a complete
balls-up of castrating this alpaca.

11:04.379 --> 11:07.014
It's a two-man job, see.

11:07.048 --> 11:10.152
One to hold him down by the legs and
the other to nip off the squealers.

11:11.086 --> 11:12.321
Could you turn that off?

11:20.628 --> 11:22.631
I want you to help me
buy a mare.

11:23.597 --> 11:26.000
You'll never learn to ride
at your age.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.069
I'm going to breed
a racehorse.

11:28.102 --> 11:30.604
Aye, and I'm gonna play fly-half
for Wales next Saturday.

11:30.638 --> 11:33.307
I bred budgies,
rabbits, whippets.

11:33.341 --> 11:35.977
Won prizes, didn't I?
And pigeons.

11:36.010 --> 11:38.312
First woman to win the
Welsh Open back in the day.

11:38.346 --> 11:40.315
Then let's get you another pigeon.
Or two even.

11:40.347 --> 11:44.185
I'm breeding a racehorse.
I've done my research.

11:44.219 --> 11:45.620
A lot more to learn,
I'm sure.

11:45.653 --> 11:47.288
But there's this fella
that comes in the club.

11:47.322 --> 11:51.259
- What fella?
- Howard. Bit arrogant.

11:51.292 --> 11:53.428
But he's an expert,
and I'm hoping he'll help.

11:54.528 --> 11:57.265
It's absolute madness.

11:58.399 --> 12:01.002
I mean, to even think
of breeding a racehorse,

12:01.035 --> 12:02.770
you're gonna need to buy
a thoroughbred mare.

12:02.803 --> 12:04.038
Where you gonna get
one of those?

12:08.109 --> 12:11.713
"Retired pedigree racehorse
for brood mare."

12:11.745 --> 12:13.314
£300?

12:15.316 --> 12:16.585
Oh, Jan, man.

12:22.456 --> 12:24.125
£300.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.194
Could have gone
to Benidorm for that.

12:27.227 --> 12:30.598
- Top racehorse, she was.
- No, she wasn't. I checked.

12:30.631 --> 12:32.466
But she got good ancestry,
though.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.302
And her father's father's
father, what a stallion.

12:35.336 --> 12:37.272
His semen has gone
all over the world.

12:40.475 --> 12:42.510
You're lovely.
Yes, you are.

12:44.611 --> 12:46.581
Where the bloody hell
are we gonna keep her?

12:51.318 --> 12:53.021
What the hell is that?

13:04.666 --> 13:06.568
Oi.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.404
I hope you got planning
permission for that, Daisy.

13:10.738 --> 13:12.607
Sod off, Maldwyn.

13:12.639 --> 13:14.275
According to
council regulations,

13:14.308 --> 13:15.776
a wooden outbuilding
should not exceed

13:15.809 --> 13:18.579
a maximum eaves height
of 2.5 meters.

13:21.482 --> 13:23.217
Oh, what's that racket?

13:25.385 --> 13:27.655
I hope it's got
its emissions certificate.

13:32.559 --> 13:35.530
No business bringing a
vehicle that size down here.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.370
Thanks for the help, Goose.

13:42.403 --> 13:44.406
You're lucky the box
was available, Jan.

13:44.438 --> 13:48.443
Been using it all winter to store Hoovers.
All totally legit, mind.

13:51.546 --> 13:52.614
Hello.

13:55.149 --> 13:56.217
Hello.

13:59.453 --> 14:00.754
All right.

14:00.788 --> 14:03.292
Come on, Rewbell.
Come on.

14:05.493 --> 14:07.796
Come on, Rewbell.

14:08.428 --> 14:09.564
Come on, Rewbell.

14:10.298 --> 14:11.332
Come on.

14:12.466 --> 14:14.302
- Come on, lovely.
- Here, let me.

14:15.636 --> 14:17.872
How many animals
do they think they need?

14:17.905 --> 14:19.907
Hope they're
gonna clean up after it.

14:19.941 --> 14:22.277
Don't worry about
this bloody circus.

14:22.309 --> 14:23.744
They can't
get the bloody thing out.

14:24.711 --> 14:26.247
What about one of these?

14:28.515 --> 14:29.650
You like that?

14:29.683 --> 14:31.819
Wanna come down, yeah?
Down we go.

14:40.294 --> 14:41.362
Yeah.

14:43.464 --> 14:45.300
All right.

14:45.332 --> 14:47.334
Good girl.
Come on. Come on.

14:47.368 --> 14:48.937
There you are.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.605
Not much,
but it's home.

14:58.679 --> 15:00.848
All right,
two pints, please.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.620
So... made a start,
haven't I?

15:06.321 --> 15:07.389
Sorry?

15:09.356 --> 15:10.591
Rewbell, she's called.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.693
Found it working
on the beach

15:12.726 --> 15:15.429
with the other donkeys
down Barry Island.

15:15.462 --> 15:17.932
Keeping it on the bloody
allotment, I heard.

15:17.966 --> 15:20.268
You mean, you've actually gone
and bought a mare?

15:20.301 --> 15:22.804
Gotta find
the right stallion now.

15:22.836 --> 15:25.240
Seen a couple
I like the look of.

15:25.907 --> 15:27.676
Yeah?

15:27.708 --> 15:29.910
You got the ten grand
for the stud fees, have you?

15:29.943 --> 15:33.280
Vet's charges,
stabling, insurance?

15:33.313 --> 15:36.350
And that's all before it starts racing.
If it ever does.

15:36.384 --> 15:37.952
But I read up about it.

15:37.985 --> 15:39.955
There's ways of doing these
things, isn't there?

15:39.988 --> 15:41.556
We set up a syndicate.

15:41.589 --> 15:43.325
'Cause if, say,
20 people in the village

15:43.357 --> 15:45.259
put in a tenner a week
for two years.

15:45.293 --> 15:47.596
I mean, I know
it's complicated, but...

15:47.629 --> 15:50.498
Yeah, it is.
But most people in the village

15:50.530 --> 15:53.367
haven't got two beans
to rub together.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.271
It's normally wealthy, professional
men who go in for this kind of thing.

15:57.971 --> 15:59.408
Bring them over,
would you?

16:00.475 --> 16:02.510
I wasn't asking for
your help, anyway.

Have a look at that.

17:08.843 --> 17:11.946
Not since that scandal
with the lasagna.

17:11.979 --> 17:14.481
Happily take those geese
off your hands, mind.

17:30.932 --> 17:33.835
The tax compliance
framework for Sinclair Beatty.

17:33.867 --> 17:35.436
Need that done by 3:00.

17:48.383 --> 17:50.085
And I need this one done
by lunchtime.

18:36.931 --> 18:38.667
It's that fella
from the club.

18:42.068 --> 18:43.137
All right.

18:45.105 --> 18:50.112
I, uh... I thought maybe I
was a bit hasty in the club.

18:51.011 --> 18:52.880
Lucky I've got
thick skin, then.

18:56.183 --> 18:58.019
This is Brian.

18:58.051 --> 19:00.054
But you can
call me Daisy.

19:00.654 --> 19:01.690
Oh.

19:43.096 --> 19:45.900
Just as I thought. Having to beat
them back at the door, are you?

19:45.932 --> 19:47.701
Very funny, Gerwyn.

19:47.734 --> 19:50.471
Well, Jan, no one can say
you didn't try, love.

19:50.505 --> 19:52.040
One more minute, Brian.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.644
Your missus know
you're doing this, Howard?

19:56.676 --> 19:59.780
No danger of losing your house
with this non-starter.

20:04.852 --> 20:05.887
Oh.

20:08.655 --> 20:10.692
Evening, all. Gerwyn.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.664
I'm fully briefed and ready to
assess the viability of this venture.

20:21.301 --> 20:25.506
Maureen!
Glad you could make it.

20:25.539 --> 20:26.641
Nothing on the telly.

20:26.673 --> 20:28.041
I just gotta say,

20:28.075 --> 20:31.913
I know absolutely sod all
about racehorses.

20:31.945 --> 20:35.215
That's all right, Maureen.
I've done the research for all of us.

20:36.717 --> 20:39.086
- Well, well.
- Hi, Goose.

20:39.119 --> 20:41.154
- All right.
- Have a seat.

20:41.188 --> 20:42.590
- Goose, is it?
- Yeah.

20:42.623 --> 20:43.892
- Howard.
- Nice to meet you.

20:43.924 --> 20:46.059
- Goose.
- Maldwyn.

20:46.093 --> 20:49.197
I'd have been in sooner,
only I had to de-gunge the mincer.

20:49.230 --> 20:51.500
You can't mix your meats.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.935
Take a seat, Nerys.

20:53.968 --> 20:57.038
Sorry, Howard.
Got totally lost, mate.

20:57.672 --> 20:59.039
Hello. Peter.

20:59.073 --> 21:00.642
Daisy.

21:00.674 --> 21:02.676
Bloody satnav tried to
send us into the lake.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.578
Oh, they will do that, yes.

21:04.612 --> 21:06.714
Peter and Gordon,
mates from work.

21:06.747 --> 21:08.750
And this is Kev,
he's my neighbor.

21:08.782 --> 21:11.685
Right.
Welcome, everyone.

21:11.719 --> 21:12.988
Let's crack on.

21:13.354 --> 21:14.556
Ha!

21:15.957 --> 21:17.892
God's sake.

21:17.924 --> 21:19.993
If you lot are good enough
to own a bloody racehorse,

21:20.027 --> 21:21.263
so am I.

21:22.663 --> 21:25.933
- It's a tenner every week, Kerby, you pillock.
- Oh.

21:25.967 --> 21:28.970
So...
the purpose of this meeting...

21:30.171 --> 21:32.006
Brian, have you got 50p?

21:32.038 --> 21:33.807
Where's the
organization in this place?

21:33.840 --> 21:35.175
There you go, love.

21:35.209 --> 21:37.077
No one touch my tenner.

21:37.111 --> 21:39.281
- Oh, yes.
- There you go. Bob's your uncle.

21:41.749 --> 21:44.852
Not sure
I understood that last point.

21:44.884 --> 21:49.089
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I still
don't quite understand.

21:49.123 --> 21:53.961
Jan is the owner
of the mother, yes?

21:53.994 --> 21:57.864
When the foal is born,
then everyone will be the owners.

21:57.897 --> 21:59.600
We'll all have
an equal share.

21:59.634 --> 22:02.636
So, who would take
the critical decisions?

22:02.670 --> 22:04.238
Which critical decisions?

22:04.270 --> 22:08.009
The horse's diet, for example.
Look here.

22:08.041 --> 22:11.913
"Racehorses should be given a
high-energy feed rich in nutrients.

22:11.945 --> 22:17.150
Excess consumption of grass may
lead to colic and flatulence."

22:17.183 --> 22:19.319
We'll have enough of that with Kerby.

22:19.353 --> 22:24.192
But this foal doesn't exist yet.
So who's the daddy?

22:24.224 --> 22:26.793
Bien Bien, he's called.
American.

22:26.826 --> 22:31.298
Ten year old, won 2.3 million
dollars before he retired.

22:31.332 --> 22:33.801
They wanted three grand stud fee,
but I knocked them right down.

22:33.834 --> 22:36.037
- Which we will pay.
- Gonna rob a bank, are you, Daisy?

22:36.069 --> 22:39.139
Which we will pay
out of our retirement fund,

22:39.173 --> 22:42.009
until the syndicate is up and
running and can reimburse us.

22:42.042 --> 22:44.244
One thing
I must stress, above all else.

22:44.278 --> 22:47.649
If you do join, don't do it
expecting to make money.

22:47.682 --> 22:52.252
There's a less than one percent chance
this horse will ever win a race.

22:52.286 --> 22:56.758
So, do it for the "hwyl."
That's what this is all about.

22:56.790 --> 22:59.226
You mean like,
the "craic"?

22:59.259 --> 23:02.730
With respect, the "hwyl" is
not the same as the "craic."

23:02.762 --> 23:04.365
The "craic"
is a Gaelic term,

23:04.397 --> 23:07.067
whereas the "hwyl" comes
from the Brythonic branch

23:07.101 --> 23:09.804
of the Celtic languages
and means "a feeling

23:09.836 --> 23:12.807
of emotional motivation
and energy."

23:14.208 --> 23:15.276
Right.

23:15.308 --> 23:17.444
I'll do it
for the "hwyl."

23:17.478 --> 23:18.913
Of course I will.

23:32.358 --> 23:34.962
Yeah, go on.
We'll both do it for the...

23:36.730 --> 23:38.400
- What's it called again?
- The "hwyl."

23:40.233 --> 23:41.336
English.

23:41.836 --> 23:42.871
Yeah.

23:43.971 --> 23:45.405
In.

23:45.439 --> 23:46.841
- Yes.
- Yeah, me too.

23:47.907 --> 23:48.942
In.

23:50.144 --> 23:51.311
Gerwyn?

23:52.179 --> 23:53.248
Well...

23:54.315 --> 23:56.750
if there's gonna be
a circus in town,

23:56.784 --> 23:58.820
may as well have
a ringside seat.

24:38.459 --> 24:39.728
Mrs. Vokes?

24:44.265 --> 24:46.067
- I'm James.
- Sorry we're late.

24:46.099 --> 24:47.534
Oh, that's all right.
This won't take long.

24:47.567 --> 24:49.002
Bien Bien
doesn't mess about.

24:50.136 --> 24:51.740
Oh, God,
he's handsome, though.

24:54.174 --> 24:56.176
And this is Rewbell.

24:56.210 --> 25:00.047
I'm not gonna lie. One of us has
left a present in the corner.

25:00.079 --> 25:01.448
Come on then, girl.

25:02.482 --> 25:03.518
What do you think?

25:04.818 --> 25:06.354
Here we go. Yeah.

25:08.087 --> 25:12.894
Well, Bien Bien is known to
upgrade his mares.

25:19.465 --> 25:21.468
- Go get him, girl.
- Brian.

25:24.270 --> 25:25.807
We should have watched.

25:27.907 --> 25:29.409
Would you like
to be watched?

25:30.411 --> 25:32.212
I'm not a stallion.

25:32.246 --> 25:34.783
You can
say that again.

25:36.282 --> 25:38.218
I've had my moments,
haven't I?

25:43.156 --> 25:45.992
Still, having a bit of fun
now, aren't we?

25:46.026 --> 25:48.863
Never knew how much I missed
messing about with horses.

25:51.365 --> 25:55.202
It's more than "a bit of fun"
and "messing about," Brian.

25:56.237 --> 25:57.538
Yeah.

25:57.570 --> 25:58.906
What do you mean?

26:00.207 --> 26:01.476
I don't know. I mean...

26:05.645 --> 26:11.249
I need something to look forward
to when I get up in the morning.

26:11.417 --> 26:16.256
To remind me
that things can... change.

26:21.228 --> 26:22.596
That was good cover!

26:22.630 --> 26:26.067
I hope he bought her
a drink first!

26:43.049 --> 26:44.251
What are you
looking at?

26:49.189 --> 26:52.159
What do you want,
then? Eh?

26:52.192 --> 26:54.261
What do you want?

26:54.295 --> 26:57.098
Oh, I know.

26:57.131 --> 26:59.934
I know. It's my mints
you're after, isn't it?

26:59.967 --> 27:02.503
Eh? You only want me
for my mints.

27:36.269 --> 27:37.404
Brian?

27:38.204 --> 27:39.973
Oh, my God. I said!

27:40.007 --> 27:43.076
Didn't I say it'd be
this week? I'm on my way.

27:43.109 --> 27:44.544
Jan.

27:44.577 --> 27:45.980
Jan, can I have
a word?

27:47.647 --> 27:49.516
Jan!

28:12.573 --> 28:14.075
Hello.

28:21.080 --> 28:24.551
Oh, God, he's gorgeous,
isn't he?

28:31.290 --> 28:32.592
Hello.

28:39.599 --> 28:41.234
Where's Rewbell?

28:43.170 --> 28:45.073
We've lost her, love.

28:46.673 --> 28:49.509
I come down first thing
and the foal had been born.

28:50.544 --> 28:53.447
There he was,
bright as a button.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.616
But I could see straightaway
that Rewbell wasn't right.

28:58.117 --> 28:59.619
So I called Ron and...

29:05.125 --> 29:07.161
There was nothing we could do,
was there, Ron?

29:36.690 --> 29:38.292
Lovely, isn't he?

29:40.294 --> 29:42.463
Maureen. Goose.

29:50.104 --> 29:52.338
Aw.

29:52.372 --> 29:55.375
I wasn't sure we should
carry on after Rewbell.

29:55.409 --> 29:57.378
Poor old girl.

29:57.411 --> 30:00.614
But look at him.
He's a real fighter.

30:00.646 --> 30:02.515
Will you look at that.

30:02.548 --> 30:04.285
What about Foal Throttle?

30:04.317 --> 30:06.586
- Butcher's Boy.
- Daisy Chain.

30:06.619 --> 30:08.154
- Lost Youth.
- Colt Leader.

30:08.188 --> 30:10.091
- Don't Tell The Missus.
- Welsh Wind!

30:10.124 --> 30:12.358
Kerby's the expert
on Welsh wind.

30:13.493 --> 30:15.062
What about Colin?

30:17.330 --> 30:19.132
After Colin Jackson.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.735
I used to love seeing him
fly over those hurdles.

30:22.702 --> 30:25.239
What about Dream Alliance?

30:26.906 --> 30:29.609
It's our dream
and we're all in it together,

30:29.643 --> 30:32.212
like an alliance,
so Dream Alliance.

30:32.246 --> 30:34.482
- Very good.
- I like that, Jan. That's good.

30:34.515 --> 30:35.650
Nah.

30:36.549 --> 30:37.684
Let's have a vote.

30:37.718 --> 30:40.388
"Cefn Rocket,"
three votes.

30:42.155 --> 30:45.225
- "Kerby," one vote.
- Worth a shot.

30:45.259 --> 30:48.128
"Dream Alliance," 12 votes.

30:48.162 --> 30:49.529
Hey!

30:49.563 --> 30:51.832
So, I am completely chuffed
to the bollocks

30:51.865 --> 30:55.301
to announce the winner
is Dream Alliance!

30:56.869 --> 30:58.171
Dream Alliance!

30:58.204 --> 31:00.907
- Dream Alliance!
- Dream Alliance!

31:00.941 --> 31:03.810
- Go on, Dream.
- Go on, Dreamy boy.

31:05.746 --> 31:08.816
So, you got a name.

31:08.848 --> 31:11.652
Dream Alliance.
What do you think?

31:19.459 --> 31:22.163
One time when I was a girl,

31:22.195 --> 31:26.699
Dad and me took Sammy and Murphy,
our whippets, to a dog show in Pontypridd.

31:26.732 --> 31:31.404
Didn't think we had a hope in hell,
us nobodies from the back of beyond.

31:31.438 --> 31:33.908
But we got first
and second prize.

31:39.846 --> 31:41.848
Dad was so proud of me.

31:44.284 --> 31:47.922
Took me for a milk shake at
Gambarini's café after to celebrate.

31:55.729 --> 31:58.766
Mmm. Seemed like anything
was possible.

34:02.490 --> 34:04.857
This driveway's
longer than our high street.

34:04.891 --> 34:06.694
Are you sure
about this, love?

34:06.727 --> 34:09.028
Philip Hobbs is the
best trainer in the country.

34:09.061 --> 34:10.764
This is where
Dream should be.

34:24.411 --> 34:26.447
Hello?

34:26.480 --> 34:29.416
Well, you've missed the turning.
It's a mile back down the road.

34:29.449 --> 34:32.885
No, mate, no. I've come about
the position of trainee jockey.

34:32.918 --> 34:36.389
- Pardon?
- We've made an appointment with Mr. Hobbs.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.892
Uh... I'm afraid the
guv'nor's with an owner.

34:39.925 --> 34:42.496
- Let's get him out, Brian.
- Aye.

34:47.166 --> 34:49.369
- Guv'nor?
- Excuse me.

34:50.936 --> 34:52.806
They say they've
got an appointment?

34:52.838 --> 34:54.607
I'm afraid I know
nothing about this.

34:55.708 --> 34:58.945
Howard arranged an appointment
with your office.

34:58.978 --> 35:02.782
- Who's Howard?
- Howard Davies. Helps me run our syndicate.

35:03.983 --> 35:07.087
Come on, then, boy.
Come on, let's show them.

35:08.155 --> 35:10.791
This is our boy.
Dream Alliance.

35:10.824 --> 35:13.527
You've actually brought
the horse with you?

35:13.559 --> 35:16.429
I'm sorry. I'm busy right now.
If an appointment was made,

35:16.463 --> 35:18.632
it would have only been
for a preliminary chat

35:18.664 --> 35:22.402
so you could view the facilities
and discuss our charges.

35:22.436 --> 35:25.506
I know about your charges and I'm
sorry we didn't come in a helicopter.

35:25.539 --> 35:27.674
We'll take
our custom elsewhere.

35:27.706 --> 35:28.742
Brian.

35:29.777 --> 35:33.447
Come on, boy.
Back to the valleys for us.

35:43.190 --> 35:45.958
Look, you've obviously
come a long way.

35:45.992 --> 35:48.695
Johnson, get the horse saddled
up and put him in the arena.

35:48.728 --> 35:51.065
I'll give you
an honest opinion.

35:52.833 --> 35:53.867
Brian.

35:54.835 --> 35:56.936
- What?
- Get him out.

35:58.637 --> 36:00.974
Come on, boy. Come on.

36:06.947 --> 36:10.050
Whoa.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.785
Whoa.

36:11.818 --> 36:14.488
Eh, eh.

36:14.521 --> 36:17.124
Calm. Come on, boy.
Come on. Come on.

36:18.925 --> 36:20.961
Come on. Come on.

36:20.994 --> 36:23.630
With a bit of work...

36:23.663 --> 36:27.534
be worth giving him a crack at
your local gymkhana. Good luck.

36:30.170 --> 36:31.639
Come on. Walk on.

36:32.806 --> 36:34.875
He's not having it, Jan.

36:34.907 --> 36:37.478
Come on, boy.
Walk on. Come on.

36:38.043 --> 36:39.045
Come on, lad.

36:40.012 --> 36:42.849
Come on.
Ooh! Whoa.

36:42.882 --> 36:44.851
Come on. Come on, boy.
Walk on.

36:44.885 --> 36:46.854
Come on. That's it.
Come on.

36:47.721 --> 36:49.989
Come on. Good boy.

36:50.023 --> 36:51.225
Good boy.

37:05.639 --> 37:06.740
Guv'nor?

37:37.637 --> 37:39.039
Well?

37:39.072 --> 37:41.175
He's pretty rough
around the edges...

37:42.309 --> 37:44.278
but he's definitely got
something about him.

37:44.311 --> 37:45.546
It's...

37:46.813 --> 37:48.181
spirit.

37:48.213 --> 37:49.782
Character.

37:49.815 --> 37:50.850
Like his owners.

38:02.295 --> 38:04.999
We'll take him for a couple
of months, see what we can do.

38:06.865 --> 38:10.003
- No promises.
- Thank you. That's all I wanted.

38:10.036 --> 38:14.875
Johnson will sort you out with a
stable and we'll go from there.

38:26.318 --> 38:27.954
I'll miss you, Dream.

38:29.989 --> 38:31.891
I'll be thinking of you
every day.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.063
This is what
you were born to do.

38:37.931 --> 38:40.900
Be brave and brilliant.

38:53.380 --> 38:56.383
Okay.

38:56.416 --> 38:57.985
Walk on.

39:44.396 --> 39:46.099
Hello?

39:46.132 --> 39:48.268
Any news
about your pony, love?

39:48.300 --> 39:49.369
Racehorse, Mam.

39:49.402 --> 39:52.039
- No, nothing.
- Oh, thank you.

39:52.072 --> 39:55.375
Howard calls occasionally and all they
say is they're still assessing him.

39:55.407 --> 39:57.243
A horse
raised on an allotment

39:57.277 --> 39:59.945
has got a cat in hell's chance
of ever racing.

39:59.978 --> 40:02.948
Howard says while they've still got
him, there's hope.

40:02.981 --> 40:08.221
Brian had a horse once, didn't he?
Lovely big teeth it had.

40:08.253 --> 40:12.858
Now, he hasn't got
the horse, or the teeth.

40:12.891 --> 40:15.061
- Let me, Brian. You get off home.
- It's damp.

40:22.235 --> 40:24.070
Well, a fat
lot of use he was.

40:24.103 --> 40:26.872
He can't help
his arthritis.

40:26.905 --> 40:31.445
He could have helped getting our Janet
in the family way when she was only 17.

40:37.784 --> 40:42.056
It's been 30 years, Dad.
Can you just leave it, now?

40:51.831 --> 40:52.865
Hello?

40:53.833 --> 40:55.001
We're going to the races.

40:56.001 --> 40:58.003
- What?
- <i>Philip Hobbs just e-mailed us.</i>

40:58.036 --> 41:00.873
But he's gonna put Dream in
a bumper race for beginners.

41:00.907 --> 41:02.742
Oh, my God,
he's gonna race?

41:02.775 --> 41:04.411
Our horse is gonna race!

41:05.043 --> 41:07.080
Whoo!

41:09.949 --> 41:11.351
Right, I'm off!

41:11.384 --> 41:13.954
Was Davina okay with you
taking the day off?

41:13.987 --> 41:16.490
Oh, yeah. Not to worry, love.
All taken care of.

41:16.523 --> 41:18.892
How come you're leaving
so early, anyway?

41:18.925 --> 41:20.961
Chepstow's not that far.

41:20.994 --> 41:23.463
Well, Kev and I just wanted
to make a real day of it.

41:23.496 --> 41:24.998
You know,
savor the atmosphere.

41:25.030 --> 41:27.266
Have a couple of bevvies
and a bar snack.

41:27.900 --> 41:28.935
Ta, love.

41:35.307 --> 41:37.043
You still haven't told Angela
about all this?

41:37.076 --> 41:39.146
You know,
I'll let her know in time.

41:41.380 --> 41:43.349
She'll be absolutely fine
with it.

42:17.349 --> 42:21.086
<i>♪ Daisy's got his teeth in
Daisy's got his teeth in ♪</i>

42:21.119 --> 42:22.989
- Good luck, Jan!
- Thanks, lovely!

42:23.021 --> 42:24.824
John!

42:24.858 --> 42:26.560
<i>♪ We're off
To see our horse race ♪</i>

42:26.592 --> 42:28.928
<i>♪ We're off to see
Our horse race ♪</i>

42:49.615 --> 42:52.284
- Here he comes!
- Fine figure of a man.

42:52.318 --> 42:54.086
Ooh...

42:56.422 --> 42:57.990
Slept in, did we, Kerby?

42:58.023 --> 42:59.393
No, no.
You're not sitting here.

43:00.360 --> 43:01.961
Your flies are undone.

43:01.994 --> 43:04.297
The cage may be open,
but the beast is asleep.

43:04.329 --> 43:06.365
Room for two more?

43:10.570 --> 43:14.307
- Oh, the dynamic duo.
- We are off to the races!

43:20.213 --> 43:22.949
- Oggy, oggy, oggy!
- Oi, oi, oi!

43:22.981 --> 43:24.985
Oh, I haven't been
so excited

43:25.018 --> 43:28.188
since Wales beat England
that day at Wembley!

43:28.221 --> 43:30.657
Shat on them, we did!

43:33.559 --> 43:34.595
Whoo!

43:37.963 --> 43:39.565
Here we go, here we go!

43:39.599 --> 43:42.936
What a sight.
The jockeys are so small.

43:42.969 --> 43:46.338
Come on, everyone.
Owners' and trainers' bar, here we come.

43:59.152 --> 44:00.920
I suppose
we should put a bet on.

44:00.954 --> 44:03.556
Yeah, 10-to-1
Kerby gets drunk.

44:03.588 --> 44:05.659
Do you know how to make
a small fortune out of horses?

44:05.692 --> 44:07.159
Start with a large fortune.

44:07.193 --> 44:09.262
Sorry, sir.
Owners only.

44:09.295 --> 44:12.465
I am a bloody owner.

44:12.498 --> 44:15.135
- May I look in your bag?
- You haven't asked to look in their bags.

44:15.168 --> 44:17.037
You can't bring alcohol
onto the course.

44:17.070 --> 44:19.673
Who says I've got alcohol?
Cheese sandwiches, that's all.

44:19.706 --> 44:21.441
He's gonna
get us all chucked out.

44:24.043 --> 44:25.278
All right, then.

44:27.380 --> 44:28.949
- Bloody knew it.
- Come on, mate.

44:28.981 --> 44:32.418
Look out.
Welsh champagne.

44:32.452 --> 44:34.054
Be here all day.

44:34.086 --> 44:35.422
You'll be pissing
like a racehorse.

44:35.454 --> 44:36.722
Come on.

44:36.755 --> 44:40.126
Never mind him. Come on.

44:42.094 --> 44:44.129
Classy in here,
ain't it? Nice soft lighting.

44:44.163 --> 44:45.998
All the big knobs are in here.

44:46.032 --> 44:49.702
I seem to have
misplaced mine.

44:49.735 --> 44:53.005
Strictly no admission into the
owners' enclosure without a pass.

44:54.373 --> 44:56.542
Ooh, finger food, is it?

44:57.275 --> 44:58.610
- Some for later?
- Brian.

44:58.643 --> 45:00.446
They're free, love.

45:00.480 --> 45:02.182
Oh, here he is.

45:02.215 --> 45:05.052
Had to get Philip Hobbs
to vouch for me, didn't I?

45:06.085 --> 45:07.753
How about this, eh?

45:07.786 --> 45:11.156
Do you think that Clare Balding
off the telly will be here?

45:11.190 --> 45:13.193
38 quid,
the cheeky buggers!

45:13.226 --> 45:14.760
- Ooh.
- That'd buy a drink

45:14.793 --> 45:17.063
for the whole
bloody room in my club.

45:18.264 --> 45:20.333
Look, look, look.
It's Lord Avery.

45:20.365 --> 45:24.070
He owns White Knight and Conquering Hero.
And most of Oxfordshire.

45:24.103 --> 45:25.505
Pals, are we?

45:25.538 --> 45:28.507
We're Lord Snooty's
bloody equal today.

45:28.541 --> 45:31.745
- Oh, look out. He's off again.
- Ooh...

45:31.777 --> 45:33.312
I'm sorry.
Have we met?

45:33.346 --> 45:36.215
We have now, butt.
Tempt you to a can?

45:36.248 --> 45:38.451
It's nice to share a drink
with a fellow owner, isn't it?

45:38.483 --> 45:39.686
Ah, you're an owner.

45:40.420 --> 45:41.588
How many?

45:41.621 --> 45:44.224
Well, there's
about 20 of us.

45:44.257 --> 45:45.358
All right!

45:47.659 --> 45:50.096
I mean, how many horses
do you own?

45:50.128 --> 45:53.799
- Just the one.
- Excellent. Enjoy it.

45:53.833 --> 45:55.468
A little tip
before the race.

45:55.501 --> 45:57.303
Ah, go on.

45:57.335 --> 45:58.637
If you're using the gents,

45:58.670 --> 46:00.706
give the first cubicle
a few minutes.

46:00.739 --> 46:02.608
<i>And
the horses for the bumper race</i>

46:02.641 --> 46:04.376
<i>are making their way
to the paddock.</i>

46:04.409 --> 46:05.744
- Here we go.
- We're up next.

46:05.777 --> 46:07.379
- Everyone got your bets on?
- Yeah.

46:07.413 --> 46:09.349
Wait. We must have a toast.

46:09.382 --> 46:10.416
That's right.

46:12.184 --> 46:13.219
To us.

46:13.251 --> 46:15.121
To us.

46:15.153 --> 46:16.523
To Dream.

46:17.222 --> 46:18.257
To Dream.

46:19.592 --> 46:21.494
Come on.

46:21.527 --> 46:23.496
<i>We're
moving on here at Chepstow.</i>

46:23.528 --> 46:25.498
<i>The conditions are good,
so we should have</i>

46:25.530 --> 46:28.134
<i>quite a tussle
in this race for beginners.</i>

46:28.166 --> 46:31.503
<i>Jockeys are mounting and they're
making their way down to the start.</i>

46:31.536 --> 46:34.139
So, he's there. He's up on
the big screen. There he is.

46:34.172 --> 46:35.741
Oh, look, there he is.

46:35.775 --> 46:38.345
<i>They're all on the racecourse
and should be good to go.</i>

46:39.811 --> 46:42.548
<i>Horses are circling
at the starting line.</i>

46:42.581 --> 46:45.585
<i>Number six, Inarco,
in the purple and orange.</i>

46:45.617 --> 46:48.153
<i>Dream Alliance, number three,
in the red and white.</i>

46:48.186 --> 46:51.223
<i>And Forgive Me Mary,
an impressive winner at Kelso.</i>

46:51.257 --> 46:54.693
<i>A bit reluctant to join the others
at this stage is Dream Alliance.</i>

46:54.726 --> 46:57.362
<i>He's become a bit playful
down at the start.</i>

46:57.396 --> 46:58.532
Oh, God.

47:01.166 --> 47:03.869
<i>Tapes are across.
Starter's getting up there.</i>

47:03.902 --> 47:07.206
<i>Perhaps they'll have to
go around again and walk in.</i>

47:07.239 --> 47:08.640
<i>Hopefully with Dream Alliance.</i>

47:08.673 --> 47:10.610
He doesn't look happy.

47:10.643 --> 47:12.579
His first race.
Bound to be a bit edgy.

47:12.612 --> 47:16.148
Edgy? He's facing
the wrong way.

47:16.181 --> 47:18.550
<i>Let's see if he settles down.</i>

47:18.583 --> 47:21.487
If he keeps going in that direction,
he'll end up back in the village.

47:21.521 --> 47:24.289
- <i>They are under orders.</i>
- Turn around, boy.

47:24.322 --> 47:26.225
<i>Dream Alliance still having
a bit of bother.</i>

47:26.259 --> 47:27.760
- <i>Will he let them go?</i>
- Turn him around!

47:27.793 --> 47:29.463
Turn him around!

47:32.331 --> 47:34.400
He's at the back! Look!

47:34.432 --> 47:35.501
He can't let them go, can he?

47:37.570 --> 47:38.805
Turn around. Come on.

47:38.838 --> 47:40.640
Turn around, man!
They've all gone!

47:40.672 --> 47:42.174
He'll be in front

47:42.208 --> 47:43.610
if he waits for
the next race to start.

47:43.643 --> 47:45.512
Come on!

47:45.545 --> 47:48.213
<i>It's a disastrous start
for Dream Alliance.</i>

47:48.246 --> 47:50.149
<i>He's about ten lengths
behind the pack.</i>

47:50.182 --> 47:51.784
I hope you're gonna
give us a refund, Jan.

47:57.389 --> 47:59.158
Come on, Dream, boy.

48:00.659 --> 48:02.661
- Come on.
- He's miles behind the others.

48:02.695 --> 48:04.664
<i>Then on the inside,
Forgive Me Mary.</i>

48:04.697 --> 48:07.367
<i>And still trailing by six,
possibly eight lengths,</i>

48:07.400 --> 48:09.402
<i>is Dream Alliance looking very
green at the back of the pack.</i>

48:09.434 --> 48:10.603
Even Daisy could run faster.

48:10.635 --> 48:12.172
It was fun
while it lasted.

48:12.204 --> 48:13.438
Come on, Dreamy boy,
you can do it.

48:13.472 --> 48:15.242
Mate, what a waste of money!

48:16.876 --> 48:19.379
<i>Inarco and Forgive Me Mary
in the middle of the field.</i>

48:39.798 --> 48:42.601
Look at him now.
He's found the accelerator.

48:42.635 --> 48:44.738
<i>Clawing back some ground
is Dream Alliance.</i>

48:46.739 --> 48:47.773
He's our boy!

48:54.012 --> 48:57.183
Come on, lad.
Come on, my boy.

49:02.487 --> 49:04.723
He's coming! He's coming!

49:07.960 --> 49:12.231
<i>Dream Alliance pushes forward.
And he's on Inarco's heels now.</i>

49:15.268 --> 49:18.237
<i>And as Cornell goes for broke,
Penelope Star in second.</i>

49:18.271 --> 49:19.806
<i>Inarco slips back.</i>

49:20.940 --> 49:22.608
Go on, Dream.

49:22.641 --> 49:24.910
<i>Dream Alliance battles
his way into fourth.</i>

49:24.943 --> 49:26.378
Go on, Dream!

49:26.411 --> 49:27.646
Come on, Dream!

49:29.748 --> 49:31.583
<i>Dream Alliance
making a real challenge</i>

49:31.617 --> 49:33.519
<i>to get amongst
the top three.</i>

49:33.552 --> 49:34.653
Come on!

49:34.686 --> 49:36.422
<i>Cornell takes it,</i>

49:36.454 --> 49:37.690
<i>second Penelope Star.</i>

49:37.722 --> 49:39.826
<i>High And Clear in third.</i>

49:39.858 --> 49:42.761
<i>And Dream Alliance coming in
a strong fourth place.</i>

49:44.630 --> 49:46.898
Fourth! Fourth! Fourth!

49:46.931 --> 49:48.634
I had him down for fourth!

49:53.539 --> 49:55.575
Yes! I won 20 quid!

49:56.409 --> 49:57.644
No bloody chips!

50:00.545 --> 50:02.414
Well done, my boy.

50:02.447 --> 50:05.050
Your mam would have been
so proud of you.

51:02.440 --> 51:03.942
Hi, love. How's things?

51:09.081 --> 51:10.416
Angela?

51:14.686 --> 51:19.025
You promised me you'd never,
ever even think of doing it again.

51:19.057 --> 51:22.461
You can't possibly have forgotten
what it was like last time.

51:24.630 --> 51:27.599
Coming this close
to losing the house.

51:29.001 --> 51:33.573
Having to raid the kids' uni fund
to pay off the mortgage arrears.

51:33.606 --> 51:35.975
All for some bloody horse.

51:37.842 --> 51:40.946
And worst of all,
you've lied to me, Howard.

51:40.980 --> 51:42.882
I know.
I shouldn't have lied.

51:42.914 --> 51:46.085
I swore I'd leave you if you
ever got into another syndicate.

51:46.117 --> 51:50.422
And I've learnt my lesson,
and this won't get out of hand, I promise.

51:50.456 --> 51:52.959
I'm gonna have those words
written on your bloody gravestone.

51:52.992 --> 51:54.994
It's completely different
this time.

51:55.027 --> 51:57.063
There's a few of us just
chipping in a tenner a week

51:57.096 --> 51:59.498
to have a bit of fun.
That's all it is.

52:04.202 --> 52:08.375
Nothing is more important
to me than you.

52:09.074 --> 52:10.576
This family.

52:10.608 --> 52:12.878
Well, you have to make
your own choices.

52:12.911 --> 52:15.381
But I don't want
anything to do with it.

52:16.748 --> 52:20.386
And if you dare jeopardize
what we've got again...

52:55.920 --> 52:59.224
And that was when I pinched
Dai Fats' prized cock!

52:59.257 --> 53:01.693
Have a look at this!

53:01.726 --> 53:04.596
We made
the front page of the <i>Argus!</i>

53:04.630 --> 53:07.900
Must be building a
tidy balance in the bank now.

53:07.932 --> 53:11.503
Aye, all that prize money, but no
mention of when we'll see any of it.

53:11.536 --> 53:15.607
You must be a witch, Jan Vokes.
Gotta be some reason you got so lucky.

53:15.641 --> 53:18.778
We'll win the Cheltenham Gold Cup, one day.
I swear we will.

53:20.579 --> 53:22.615
Come on.
Let's go play some dominos.

53:22.648 --> 53:24.851
No, let's have
a game of darts.

53:40.900 --> 53:43.802
Hello, gorgeous.
How are you doing?

53:49.108 --> 53:50.776
Oh.

53:50.809 --> 53:52.245
You're looking lovely.

53:54.547 --> 53:58.851
The other day at work I spent two
hours stacking tinned sweet corn.

54:00.853 --> 54:03.155
And all I could
think about was...

54:06.125 --> 54:07.159
Well...

54:09.827 --> 54:11.530
All my life...

54:12.130 --> 54:13.899
I've never been me.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.036
I've been Elsie's daughter,

54:18.070 --> 54:20.039
Dennis and Sasha's mother...

54:21.172 --> 54:23.008
or Daisy's wife.

54:25.277 --> 54:27.914
But watching you race...

54:29.248 --> 54:30.717
I'm Jan.

54:33.786 --> 54:35.121
Mrs. Vokes.

54:36.221 --> 54:37.923
Don't wanna disturb you.

54:37.956 --> 54:41.726
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what? He's your horse.

54:41.760 --> 54:45.732
Anyway, glad you dropped by.
Got some news for you.

54:47.199 --> 54:49.601
Really? Newbury?

54:56.375 --> 54:59.010
- Where's the owners' bar, then?
- There, boy.

54:59.043 --> 55:01.580
My God, Howard.

55:01.614 --> 55:04.550
You weren't wrong.
This really is something else.

55:08.253 --> 55:12.358
Have any of you spotted Clare Balding?
She must be around somewhere.

55:12.391 --> 55:15.061
- There's a rumor Mick Jagger's here.
- Ooh.

55:15.094 --> 55:16.329
Not that I'm
bothered, mind.

55:16.362 --> 55:17.863
I suppose
you're used to this,

55:17.896 --> 55:19.865
hanging out
with the big knobs.

55:19.898 --> 55:22.602
- How do you mean?
- That's what you do all day, isn't it?

55:22.635 --> 55:25.972
Telling them rich buggers
how they can avoid paying tax.

55:26.005 --> 55:27.974
Bit more complicated
than that, Kerby.

55:28.007 --> 55:31.077
I call it legalized
robbery, myself.

55:31.110 --> 55:36.816
I've just had a pee next to
Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.

55:36.849 --> 55:41.754
I told him I thought <i>Evita</i> was a far
superior work to <i>Phantom of the Opera.</i>

55:41.786 --> 55:43.722
Right, so look here.

55:43.755 --> 55:46.692
Dream's still way out
at 16-to-1.

55:46.724 --> 55:50.028
Fearless Pursuit is massive odds-on.
He's one of His Lordship's horses.

55:50.061 --> 55:52.931
He's won the last
nine out of ten races.

55:52.965 --> 55:56.068
This time he really is
up against the big boys.

55:58.003 --> 56:00.740
And she bred the damn horse
on an allotment!

56:00.773 --> 56:02.141
An allotment!

56:04.009 --> 56:06.144
<i>It's almost time
for the main event here</i>

56:06.177 --> 56:07.846
<i>at Newbury Festival,</i>

56:07.880 --> 56:10.282
<i>the King Edward Challenge
over two miles.</i>

56:10.315 --> 56:13.786
<i>Lord Avery's horse, Fearless
Pursuit, is the bookies' favorite,</i>

56:13.818 --> 56:15.755
<i>hoping for
yet another victory.</i>

56:15.788 --> 56:17.923
<i>He's shaping up to be
a true legend of the track.</i>

56:17.956 --> 56:21.661
- You all right, girl?
- It's a big race, Brian.

56:21.693 --> 56:26.065
Hurdles and everything. He's never
done that on a course this size.

56:28.266 --> 56:32.437
<i>Out next is My Heaven, in the light
blue, followed by reigning champion,</i>

56:32.471 --> 56:35.840
<i>Fearless Pursuit, number four,
in yellow and lilac.</i>

56:35.873 --> 56:37.909
<i>Owned, of course,
by Lord Avery.</i>

56:40.978 --> 56:44.315
<i>And the horse raised on
an allotment, Dream Alliance,</i>

56:44.349 --> 56:47.385
<i>number three, in the
red and white striped cap.</i>

56:49.221 --> 56:51.990
<i>The horses taking a look
at the first hurdle</i>

56:52.023 --> 56:53.992
<i>in the King Edward Challenge.</i>

56:54.025 --> 56:56.961
<i>A wide range of experience
amongst our runners today.</i>

56:56.994 --> 57:00.132
<i>For some of them, this is
their first time over jumps.</i>

57:05.938 --> 57:08.708
- <i>They're being called back now.</i>
- Come on, then, boy.

57:08.740 --> 57:10.909
<i>And they'll soon
be good to go.</i>

57:10.943 --> 57:13.345
- There we go.
- Come on, hurry up.

57:13.378 --> 57:15.847
<i>Dream Alliance
yet to win a race.</i>

57:15.880 --> 57:19.350
<i>Fearless Pursuit looking
every inch the aristocrat.</i>

57:19.384 --> 57:21.454
<i>Trained at
the Berkshire court stables,</i>

57:21.487 --> 57:25.791
<i>let's see if Fearless Pursuit
can reign victorious again.</i>

57:25.824 --> 57:28.927
<i>I think we're good to go for this
famous race. The flag is raised.</i>

57:28.960 --> 57:31.229
I've got sweaty palms. Feel.

57:35.199 --> 57:38.770
<i>Bunched nearly together.
It's a pretty good start.</i>

57:38.804 --> 57:40.940
<i>Chauncey Lad taking
the early lead at the front.</i>

57:40.972 --> 57:44.943
<i>A certain amount of jockeying
for position in behind.</i>

57:44.976 --> 57:47.078
<i>Now muscling
past Spring Morning</i>

57:47.112 --> 57:50.081
<i>is Lord Avery's
Fearless Pursuit, number four,</i>

57:50.114 --> 57:53.218
<i>asserting his dominance early as
they approach the first hurdle.</i>

57:53.251 --> 57:56.889
<i>My Heaven in third, then Kelly's
Nan, then Justice Jones</i>

57:56.922 --> 57:59.391
<i>and Dream Alliance right
in the middle of the pack.</i>

57:59.423 --> 58:03.061
<i>First jump,
always a challenge.</i>

58:03.094 --> 58:07.031
<i>The leaders are over,
followed by the rest of the pack.</i>

58:07.065 --> 58:09.467
Good job!

58:09.501 --> 58:12.538
<i>Fearless Pursuit and Spring
Morning, neck and neck</i>

58:12.570 --> 58:14.440
<i>as they come over the next hurdle.</i>

58:14.472 --> 58:17.442
<i>That's a nasty fall.
Jeanguin, out of the race.</i>

58:17.476 --> 58:21.748
<i>Both rider and horse up on their feet.
That's good to see.</i>

58:23.514 --> 58:26.752
<i>Dream Alliance takes it pretty smoothly.</i>

58:29.353 --> 58:31.489
<i>Setting a fast pace
is Fearless Pursuit,</i>

58:31.523 --> 58:34.961
<i>who won this race in
commanding fashion last year.</i>

58:35.827 --> 58:37.429
<i>They approach the next jump.</i>

58:40.565 --> 58:42.367
<i>Dream Alliance inching his way
up the pack.</i>

58:42.400 --> 58:44.169
Come on.
You can do this, boy.

58:50.242 --> 58:51.510
Come on, my boy!

58:56.414 --> 59:00.186
<i>Dream Alliance muscles past
and finds his way into fourth</i>

59:00.219 --> 59:01.854
<i>as they round the far bend.</i>

59:04.856 --> 59:06.257
Oh, my God, he's doing it!

59:06.291 --> 59:08.928
<i>Heading round
to the final straight.</i>

59:10.394 --> 59:13.365
<i>Dream Alliance
giving all he's got.</i>

59:14.365 --> 59:16.335
Come on, Dream!
Come on, my boy!

59:16.367 --> 59:19.137
<i>Dream Alliance
showing real spirit.</i>

59:19.170 --> 59:23.274
<i>The boy from the valleys scrapping his
way past My Heaven and Spring Morning,</i>

59:23.307 --> 59:28.581
<i>letting Fearless Pursuit know he's
got a real fight on his hands.</i>

59:28.614 --> 59:32.585
<i>Dream Alliance threatening the
reigning champion, Fearless Pursuit.</i>

59:32.617 --> 59:36.020
<i>This is now a two-horse race
as they take the second last.</i>

59:36.054 --> 59:37.856
Come on, Dream!

59:37.889 --> 59:39.490
<i>They're safely
over the last hurdle.</i>

59:39.523 --> 59:41.025
<i>It's a titanic battle.</i>

59:41.059 --> 59:42.528
He's gonna do it!

59:42.561 --> 59:44.530
<i>Dream Alliance pulls ahead
of Fearless Pursuit.</i>

59:44.563 --> 59:46.432
- He's gonna do it!
- <i>This rank outsider</i>

59:46.465 --> 59:48.367
<i>digging deep
and showing his class.</i>

59:48.400 --> 59:50.202
<i>We did not see this coming!</i>

59:50.235 --> 59:53.405
Fight back! Come on, boy!

59:53.438 --> 59:56.407
<i>Could we be witnessing
the arrival of a new champion?</i>

59:56.440 --> 1:00:00.913
<i>The young novice is powering ahead,
a length clear. Now two lengths!</i>

1:00:00.945 --> 1:00:05.518
<i>Dream Alliance, he smells victory.
Untouchable now as he pulls ahead.</i>

1:00:06.652 --> 1:00:08.554
<i>And wins!</i>

1:00:09.454 --> 1:00:10.589
Oh, my God!

1:00:17.195 --> 1:00:18.898
Oh, my God!

1:00:20.599 --> 1:00:24.303
<i>Dream Alliance stealing the
crown from Fearless Pursuit</i>

1:00:24.335 --> 1:00:27.138
<i>in a remarkable turnaround
here at Newbury.</i>

1:00:27.172 --> 1:00:30.909

<i>And now it's time to present

course, the check for £26,250!

Split evenly.
Of course.

1:01:30.469 --> 1:01:32.604
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:01:32.637 --> 1:01:35.374
Bad luck about your
Fearless Pursuit, butt.

1:01:38.443 --> 1:01:43.015
Has it occurred to you this might
be time to take a tidy profit?

1:01:43.047 --> 1:01:44.482
How do you mean?

1:01:44.516 --> 1:01:46.684
I'm prepared to make
a substantial offer.

1:01:46.717 --> 1:01:50.588
Oh, God.
I'd never sell him. Never.

1:01:50.621 --> 1:01:52.423
You haven't
heard the offer yet.

1:01:52.456 --> 1:01:54.659
I wouldn't sell him
for 500 million.

1:01:55.527 --> 1:01:58.664
Well, if you change
your mind.

1:02:00.699 --> 1:02:04.003
Hang on a minute.
That's not right.

1:02:04.036 --> 1:02:05.503
What, the idea
of selling Dream?

1:02:05.536 --> 1:02:07.239
No, it's bloody
ridiculous.

1:02:07.271 --> 1:02:09.474
No, I mean him offering
to buy him off Jan.

1:02:09.507 --> 1:02:11.609
The horse belongs
to all of us.

1:02:11.643 --> 1:02:14.679
Correct. Any financial offer
should be put formally

1:02:14.713 --> 1:02:16.749
to the syndicate
for consideration.

1:02:16.782 --> 1:02:19.050
We're not selling him
and that's that.

1:02:19.083 --> 1:02:22.387
With respect, Jan,
that's not for you to say.

1:02:22.420 --> 1:02:23.688
Are you deaf,
Gerwyn, or what?

1:02:23.722 --> 1:02:25.290
She's just bloody said it.

1:02:25.322 --> 1:02:26.759
Legally she has
no right to.

1:02:26.791 --> 1:02:29.161
But morally
she has every right.

1:02:29.193 --> 1:02:31.329
Surely we can
all agree about that?

1:02:31.362 --> 1:02:33.097
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:02:33.130 --> 1:02:35.466
Come on, boys.
Let's just celebrate our win.

Oi, Rossi,
feet off the chairs.

1:02:50.081 --> 1:02:53.284
It's absolute pandemonium in here.
I don't recognize half this lot.

1:02:53.318 --> 1:02:55.153
I know. Once upon a time,

1:02:55.186 --> 1:02:57.355
people didn't even want to admit
they came from this village.

1:02:57.389 --> 1:02:59.591
Now half the valleys
reckon they live here.

1:02:59.623 --> 1:03:02.693
How much do you reckon Lord Snooty
would have offered us for Dream?

1:03:02.726 --> 1:03:04.695
Tens, maybe hundreds
of thousands.

1:03:07.666 --> 1:03:09.568
Thanks for standing up
for me before.

1:03:10.534 --> 1:03:11.670
That's okay.

1:03:13.105 --> 1:03:14.606
We both know
this has always been about

1:03:14.639 --> 1:03:16.809
something much more
important than money.

Care to read it?

1:04:20.838 --> 1:04:24.275
"Just quit moaning
and pay up, you bastards."

1:04:26.478 --> 1:04:31.717
They had a tax bill. I'm a tax advisor.
I advised them to pay it.

1:04:31.750 --> 1:04:35.688
You know, Howard, I've started to wonder
lately why you came into this profession.

1:04:37.188 --> 1:04:39.557
Oh, you're not
the only one.

1:04:39.590 --> 1:04:44.328
'Cause I have no idea why I
sit behind this desk all day,

1:04:44.362 --> 1:04:47.166

1:04:47.199 --> 1:04:49.434
save millions in tax

1:04:49.467 --> 1:04:53.372
while people out there can barely
afford to put food on their tables.

1:04:54.405 --> 1:04:55.875
You know, it's...

1:04:56.574 --> 1:04:58.409
legalized robbery.

1:04:58.443 --> 1:05:00.179
Howard, mate.

1:05:08.219 --> 1:05:10.488
Has to be something better
I can do with my life.

1:05:14.893 --> 1:05:17.630
He's taking the lamp.
Why is he taking the lamp?

1:05:19.597 --> 1:05:22.433
Resigned?
What were you thinking?

1:05:22.467 --> 1:05:25.771
I wasn't thinking.
That's the whole point. I was just...

1:05:29.407 --> 1:05:31.610
It's what I feel.

1:05:31.643 --> 1:05:34.713
It's what I felt for years.
I can't do that job anymore.

1:05:34.746 --> 1:05:37.416
This is that bloody horse
again, isn't it?

1:05:37.449 --> 1:05:39.985
Being involved with Jan and
the syndicate has made me feel

1:05:40.018 --> 1:05:44.789
like I'm part of something important
for the first time in years.

1:05:44.822 --> 1:05:46.791
And it's bloody fabulous.

1:05:46.824 --> 1:05:49.594
It's selfish!
And it's reckless!

1:05:49.628 --> 1:05:51.263
I can work it out.
We'll manage.

1:05:51.295 --> 1:05:53.965
Oh, how exactly?
On my wages?

1:05:56.768 --> 1:05:59.704
So, I've been talking to Philip,

1:05:59.737 --> 1:06:03.808
and he reckons Dream's bouncing,
in the form of his life.

1:06:03.842 --> 1:06:07.445
Howard reckons it's partly that
new probiotic food they got him on.

1:06:07.478 --> 1:06:09.614
And they've got him in that
new equine swimming pool.

1:06:09.648 --> 1:06:11.950
Dream absolutely loves it,
apparently.

1:06:11.983 --> 1:06:14.553
Howard says swimming is brilliant
for building up muscle strength

1:06:14.585 --> 1:06:15.920
in the hindquarters.

1:06:16.655 --> 1:06:17.723
Brian?

1:06:18.523 --> 1:06:19.658
What's the matter?

1:06:20.391 --> 1:06:21.926
Nothing.

1:06:23.061 --> 1:06:24.930
Come on, spit it out.

1:06:30.735 --> 1:06:33.672
I miss him, is all... Dream.

1:06:33.704 --> 1:06:37.375
It's stupid, isn't it? Missing
something I didn't even know I wanted.

1:06:37.409 --> 1:06:39.911
No, it's not stupid.

1:06:39.943 --> 1:06:41.313
But still...

1:06:41.346 --> 1:06:43.282
that's the way life is.

1:06:43.315 --> 1:06:44.416
I shouldn't grumble.

1:06:46.784 --> 1:06:51.022
But life's not like that, Brian.
That's the whole point.

1:06:51.056 --> 1:06:52.858
There's a whole world
out there you don't see

1:06:52.891 --> 1:06:54.659
because you're just sat
watching the telly.

1:06:55.659 --> 1:06:56.928
You what?

1:06:58.063 --> 1:06:59.965
Look, when Dream arrived...

1:07:01.032 --> 1:07:02.934
I saw you light up.

1:07:06.338 --> 1:07:09.508
Look, I know you miss him.
But don't just...

1:07:10.474 --> 1:07:12.911
settle back into
your old ways again.

1:07:12.943 --> 1:07:14.579
I shouldn't have said
anything.

1:07:15.646 --> 1:07:17.715
I don't mind really.
I'm happy enough.

1:07:17.748 --> 1:07:21.619
No, Brian, you're always "happy
enough." You lost your job,

1:07:21.652 --> 1:07:24.789
you said, "Never mind, another one
will come along." And it never did.

1:07:24.822 --> 1:07:28.527
You got arthritis, you said, "Oh, well,
we all get old and ill sooner or later."

1:07:28.559 --> 1:07:31.730
I mean, when I first met you,
you were a fighter.

1:07:31.762 --> 1:07:35.634
And now
you just accept things.

1:07:35.666 --> 1:07:37.435
You don't fight anymore.

1:07:46.710 --> 1:07:48.713
So, what your dad said
was right.

1:07:50.782 --> 1:07:53.352
You could have done
a lot better for yourself.

1:08:14.739 --> 1:08:17.975
So I can evade tax,
but I can't avoid it.

1:08:18.009 --> 1:08:21.712
Other way around, Nerys.
Avoid, not evade.

1:08:21.746 --> 1:08:25.617
- Evasion they don't like.
- Got it. Um...

1:08:25.649 --> 1:08:30.021
things are a little tight
cash-wise these days, so...

1:08:31.622 --> 1:08:33.024
best sirloin.

1:08:34.591 --> 1:08:36.627
- Cheers, Nerys.
- Enjoy.

1:08:38.529 --> 1:08:41.466
- Oh. Hello, Nerys.
- Jan.

1:08:42.100 --> 1:08:44.536
Whoo.

1:08:45.436 --> 1:08:47.405
It's looking very smart,
Howard.

1:08:47.439 --> 1:08:52.411
Well, the refurbishment
is, um, ongoing.

1:08:52.444 --> 1:08:55.647
How come, though?
You had a good job in Cardiff, didn't you?

1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:58.917
Uh, well, I realized
I couldn't do it anymore.

1:08:58.949 --> 1:09:03.587
And I wasn't gonna live a life
of lost chances like my dad.

1:09:03.621 --> 1:09:06.190
- What happened to him?
- Uh...

1:09:06.224 --> 1:09:10.494
ran away from home at 14 with a
dream of being a famous jockey.

1:09:10.528 --> 1:09:13.465
Lied about his age,
got a job at a racing stables.

1:09:13.497 --> 1:09:15.966
The coppers tracked him
down, bought him home.

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.670
Became a lifer
at the steelworks and...

1:09:18.703 --> 1:09:20.872
that was that.

1:09:20.904 --> 1:09:23.908
"Don't let them crush your
dreams," he used to say.

1:09:26.944 --> 1:09:30.614
And at least I've had plenty of time to
keep on top of the syndicate finances.

1:09:30.648 --> 1:09:34.720
Believe it or not, we're showing an
overall profit of about a hundred grand.

1:09:35.619 --> 1:09:36.887
Good God.

1:09:36.921 --> 1:09:38.690
I never in
a million years thought

1:09:38.722 --> 1:09:40.559
we'd make
this kind of money.

1:09:40.591 --> 1:09:42.226
That's not
the only good news.

1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:45.831
Philip Hobbs wants to race
Dream at Aintree on Saturday.

1:09:45.863 --> 1:09:47.565
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I know.

1:09:52.804 --> 1:09:55.173
- A wedding, is it?
- No, Mam.

1:09:56.140 --> 1:09:58.243
It's two of
the yellow ones, Dad.

1:09:58.275 --> 1:10:00.878
- I've taken two.
- No, you've only taken the white.

1:10:00.912 --> 1:10:04.615
Sasha?
Is our Sasha getting married?

1:10:04.649 --> 1:10:07.719
No, Mam. I told you.

1:10:07.752 --> 1:10:10.555
I'm off to Aintree
'cause Dream's racing there.

1:10:10.587 --> 1:10:14.492
Aintree!
Bert, did you hear that?

1:10:16.226 --> 1:10:20.198
We'll watch it on the telly, Jan.
We love doing that.

1:10:23.967 --> 1:10:26.938
I need you to pick up my
prescription from the chemist.

1:10:33.912 --> 1:10:35.881
Is that all
you can say, Dad?

1:10:36.847 --> 1:10:38.850
- What?
- The horse I bred

1:10:38.882 --> 1:10:40.851
is racing in the biggest
meet in the calendar,

1:10:40.885 --> 1:10:42.921
and that's all
you can say?

1:10:46.890 --> 1:10:48.059
I'll see you later.

1:11:02.873 --> 1:11:05.143
<i>Welcome to Aintree,</i>

1:11:05.176 --> 1:11:07.312
<i>where we've got a record-breaking
attendance on the course</i>

1:11:07.345 --> 1:11:09.648
<i>of 75,000 people</i>

1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:12.983
<i>here to celebrate the very
best of British racing.</i>

1:11:13.016 --> 1:11:16.820
<i>The going is good as the horses gather
at the starting line for the next race.</i>

1:11:16.854 --> 1:11:20.259
<i>A three-mile, half-a-furlong
handicap over hurdles.</i>

1:11:23.994 --> 1:11:25.764
There he is!
Looking good.

1:11:25.796 --> 1:11:26.831
All right, Daisy?

1:11:27.998 --> 1:11:29.635
Tidy enough, thanks.

1:11:32.170 --> 1:11:35.105
<i>Horses coming out onto the
course led by Real Charmer,</i>

1:11:35.139 --> 1:11:37.609
<i>very much on his toes,
keen to get on with things,</i>

1:11:37.641 --> 1:11:40.845
<i>alongside Aurora's Encore,
a winner here just two days ago.</i>

1:11:40.877 --> 1:11:44.582
<i>Dream Alliance,
in his now-familiar red and white colors,</i>

1:11:44.615 --> 1:11:47.152
<i>is number three on your card,
and number one is According To Pete.</i>

1:11:47.185 --> 1:11:48.954
Come on, then, boy.
Hey, he's looking good.

1:11:48.987 --> 1:11:51.690
Over there, look.
Come on, Dreamy!

1:11:51.722 --> 1:11:53.224
<i>Starter is
calling them forward.</i>

1:11:53.256 --> 1:11:54.858
I've got a good feeling
about this one.

1:11:54.891 --> 1:11:56.094
Come on, Dream!

1:11:56.894 --> 1:11:58.030
<i>Flag is up.</i>

1:11:59.697 --> 1:12:01.967
<i>And they're off and racing.</i>

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.668
<i>So, the field leave the tapes
bunched together.</i>

1:12:04.702 --> 1:12:06.805
<i>Buena Vista,
the first one to show...</i>

1:12:06.837 --> 1:12:08.907
Take it easy.
Good start.

1:12:08.939 --> 1:12:10.908
<i>Dream Alliance challenging
According To Pete,</i>

1:12:10.942 --> 1:12:12.810
<i>racing in
the blue and white colors,</i>

1:12:12.844 --> 1:12:14.680
<i>currently in
the middle of the field.</i>

1:12:17.782 --> 1:12:20.018
Come on, Dreamy boy.

1:12:20.051 --> 1:12:22.387
<i>Deep Focus
edges past Buena Vista now,</i>

1:12:22.420 --> 1:12:24.288
<i>while Dream Alliance
tries to make ground</i>

1:12:24.322 --> 1:12:26.324
<i>on the outside
of According To Pete.</i>

1:12:28.192 --> 1:12:30.328
<i>Deep Focus is out of the race.</i>

1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:33.230
<i>Takes a pretty hefty fall.
Horse and jockey look okay...</i>

1:12:33.264 --> 1:12:35.400
- Is he up?
- <i>...and quickly on their feet.</i>

1:12:35.432 --> 1:12:36.801
Come on, Dream!

1:12:38.069 --> 1:12:40.305
<i>...as they approach
the next flight of hurdles.</i>

1:12:43.908 --> 1:12:46.945
<i>Dream Alliance is jumping with real confidence now.</i>

1:12:46.978 --> 1:12:48.846
- Come on, Dream. Come on, boy!
- <i>He's up into third place,</i>

1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:50.981
<i>chased hard
by both Superior Wisdom,</i>

1:12:51.015 --> 1:12:53.285
- <i>and then comes Aurora's Encore.</i>
- Come on, Dream!

1:12:55.353 --> 1:12:57.756
Come on, Dream!

1:12:57.788 --> 1:13:00.826
<i>Dream Alliance now just
a length and a half behind.</i>

1:13:02.827 --> 1:13:04.863
<i>Dream Alliance and According
to Pete neck and neck.</i>

1:13:04.895 --> 1:13:07.264
<i>Nothing between these two
as they take the next.</i>

1:13:10.033 --> 1:13:11.869
<i>And the field
head round the final bend.</i>

1:13:11.903 --> 1:13:13.371
<i>Buena Vista continues
to lead the way.</i>

1:13:13.404 --> 1:13:15.774
<i>According To Pete

1:13:15.806 --> 1:13:19.010
<i>Superior Wisdom in third and
behind them Aurora's Encore.</i>

1:13:19.042 --> 1:13:20.711
Where's Dream?

1:13:20.744 --> 1:13:22.180
I can't see him, either.

1:13:22.212 --> 1:13:24.215
Howard, can you
see anything?

1:13:25.349 --> 1:13:26.652
He's not there.

1:13:27.784 --> 1:13:29.153
- Can you see him?
- Oh, Jesus.

1:13:29.186 --> 1:13:30.822
Oh, what's happening?
Let me see.

1:13:31.788 --> 1:13:33.358
They're putting screens
around him.

1:13:34.859 --> 1:13:36.695
Means they're gonna
shoot him, don't it?

1:13:36.728 --> 1:13:38.230
Stay calm, everyone.

1:13:40.297 --> 1:13:41.465
The vet's arrived.

1:13:41.498 --> 1:13:43.702
They can't shoot him.

1:13:43.734 --> 1:13:45.936
If his leg's broken
they'd have to, Jan.

1:13:45.970 --> 1:13:47.204
Okay, I'm calling Philip.

1:13:50.041 --> 1:13:51.309
What are they saying?

1:13:53.010 --> 1:13:54.746
Pick up, Philip, pick up.

1:13:55.912 --> 1:13:57.247
Philip?

1:13:57.280 --> 1:13:59.451
Put him on speaker.

1:13:59.484 --> 1:14:01.753
- <i>Philip, what's happening?</i>
- They can't tell how bad it is,

1:14:01.786 --> 1:14:03.253
but it looks like
he's severed a tendon.

1:14:03.287 --> 1:14:05.090
That's serious, isn't it?

1:14:05.122 --> 1:14:07.324
<i>If confirmed,
then he'd never run again.</i>

1:14:09.092 --> 1:14:11.429
- Philip?
- Yeah. Hold on.

1:14:11.462 --> 1:14:15.133
Oh, please, God, we can't lose him.
We can't lose him. We can't.

1:14:16.533 --> 1:14:18.869
It's kinder to put
a horse down immediately

1:14:18.903 --> 1:14:20.805
in these circumstances,
you know.

1:14:22.006 --> 1:14:24.409
Whoa! Stand clear!

1:14:24.442 --> 1:14:26.478
Hello, Howard?
Vet thinks the tendon

1:14:26.511 --> 1:14:28.046
may not be
completely severed

1:14:28.078 --> 1:14:30.914
and there's a chance
it could be repaired.

1:14:30.948 --> 1:14:34.452
Then try, for God's sake! If there's
the faintest chance of saving him!

1:14:34.484 --> 1:14:37.087
<i>I have to warn you,
if the tendon can't be repaired,</i>

1:14:37.121 --> 1:14:38.957
<i>he'd still have to be
euthanized.</i>

1:14:38.989 --> 1:14:42.760
- Right, Philip.
- <i>And if we remove him from the course</i>

1:14:42.793 --> 1:14:44.828
<i>and the operation
does fail,</i>

1:14:44.862 --> 1:14:46.931
you'd lose
the insurance money

1:14:46.963 --> 1:14:50.434
and, of course,
face substantial bills.

1:14:53.436 --> 1:14:56.807
Philip, we don't have time.
I really need an answer.

1:14:57.942 --> 1:14:59.409
Well, how much
is he insured for?

1:14:59.443 --> 1:15:02.280
Currently,
120 thousand pound.

1:15:02.313 --> 1:15:04.181
Maybe we need
to discuss this.

1:15:04.215 --> 1:15:06.985
No, there's nothing to discuss.
What's there to discuss?

1:15:07.018 --> 1:15:10.855
Well, 120 grand, to start with.
That's a hell of a lot of money.

1:15:10.887 --> 1:15:12.422
Look, he belongs
to all of us,

1:15:12.456 --> 1:15:14.993
and any decision about
what happens to him

1:15:15.025 --> 1:15:16.961
should be taken
collectively.

1:15:16.993 --> 1:15:18.962
- It's a fair point.
- Yeah, but...

1:15:18.996 --> 1:15:21.966
Like it should have been that day
Lord Avery offered to buy him.

1:15:21.998 --> 1:15:23.967
You're not still on
about that, Gerwyn?

1:15:24.001 --> 1:15:26.905
- Wait. Listen.
- This is a syndicate, isn't it?

1:15:26.938 --> 1:15:28.806
He's suffering and all alone!

1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:32.844
Everybody be quiet
and just listen to Janet!

1:15:38.248 --> 1:15:41.019
Look, before Dream...

1:15:41.051 --> 1:15:42.420
who were we?

1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:45.055
Gerwyn?

1:15:46.323 --> 1:15:47.391
Kerby?

1:15:48.391 --> 1:15:51.095
We lost our jobs,
our community.

1:15:52.128 --> 1:15:53.965
Even lost our pride.

1:15:55.498 --> 1:15:57.335
And then Dream came along

1:15:57.368 --> 1:16:00.939
and reminded us all what life
is like when you have hope.

1:16:02.273 --> 1:16:05.409
Dream's out on that course
in agony,

1:16:05.443 --> 1:16:07.912
his life hanging by a thread,

1:16:07.944 --> 1:16:09.880
and you're talking about
putting a gun to his head

1:16:09.913 --> 1:16:12.082
so you can have a couple
of grand in your pockets.

1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:18.989
Too bloody right.

1:16:19.023 --> 1:16:21.391
Dream's never asked us
for anything before.

1:16:21.425 --> 1:16:24.095
- He's just given us his all.
- Yeah.

1:16:24.127 --> 1:16:27.064
Dream has given me
a second chance.

1:16:27.097 --> 1:16:29.333
He's given us all
a second chance.

1:16:30.268 --> 1:16:32.069
And now...

1:16:33.136 --> 1:16:35.139
I think we need to
give him one.

1:16:35.171 --> 1:16:38.108
- Fair enough.
- Yeah.

1:16:39.609 --> 1:16:41.246
Hmm?

1:16:41.279 --> 1:16:42.314
Right.

1:16:45.015 --> 1:16:46.951
Philip.

1:16:46.984 --> 1:16:50.521
Tell them they gotta do whatever
they can to try and save him.

1:16:50.554 --> 1:16:54.492
Steady! Steady, Dream.

1:17:05.536 --> 1:17:06.904
Anything?

1:17:18.649 --> 1:17:20.218
Brian, I...

1:17:20.251 --> 1:17:22.554
It's...
It's all right, girl.

1:17:47.110 --> 1:17:48.578
Dream's had an accident.

1:17:48.612 --> 1:17:51.016
They've been operating on him
through the night.

1:18:19.176 --> 1:18:21.079
Philip? What's the news?

1:18:25.282 --> 1:18:26.484
I see.

1:18:29.286 --> 1:18:30.454
Right.

1:18:32.222 --> 1:18:33.591
Okay, thanks.

1:18:36.493 --> 1:18:38.095
Well?

1:18:38.128 --> 1:18:40.597
We hope he'll be able
to walk again.

1:18:40.631 --> 1:18:44.068
But you do understand,
the chances of him racing again

1:18:44.100 --> 1:18:45.435
are virtually nonexistent.

1:18:45.469 --> 1:18:47.672
All I care about
is he gets well.

1:18:53.310 --> 1:18:57.015
And if the tendon
won't heal and he's lame,

1:18:57.047 --> 1:19:00.350
well, then we'll have to
consider his quality of life.

1:19:00.384 --> 1:19:01.418
Aw.

1:19:02.086 --> 1:19:03.221
Hello.

1:19:07.425 --> 1:19:08.693
God, Dream.

1:19:08.725 --> 1:19:10.394

1:20:58.769 --> 1:21:00.137
Mrs. Davies?

1:21:01.238 --> 1:21:02.673
Angela?

1:21:02.706 --> 1:21:05.176
I'm Jan.
From the syndicate.

1:21:06.476 --> 1:21:07.845
Oh, right.

1:21:09.180 --> 1:21:10.280
Hi.

1:21:11.715 --> 1:21:14.152
How's Howard?
Haven't seen him in a while.

1:21:14.185 --> 1:21:15.753
Not since what happened
with Dream.

1:21:15.786 --> 1:21:18.256
Yes, I heard.

1:21:19.523 --> 1:21:23.261
I was, um, so sorry
about his accident.

1:21:23.293 --> 1:21:26.264
Thanks. He's alive.
That's the main thing.

1:21:26.296 --> 1:21:27.364
Yes.

1:21:31.569 --> 1:21:32.737
Well, I...

1:21:33.871 --> 1:21:35.940
I just, um...

1:21:35.972 --> 1:21:38.176
wanted to say I think
it's brilliant...

1:21:39.609 --> 1:21:42.779
supporting Howard the way you did
with the syndicate and everything.

1:21:42.813 --> 1:21:47.451
I mean, after the last time,
a lot of wives wouldn't have done that.

1:21:47.484 --> 1:21:50.254
It wasn't until he told me that
story about his dad running away

1:21:50.287 --> 1:21:52.289
and becoming a jockey

1:21:52.323 --> 1:21:54.926
that I really understood why
this mattered to him so much.

1:21:56.260 --> 1:21:58.896
But I guess
you knew that all along.

1:22:02.233 --> 1:22:03.333
Yes.

1:22:04.001 --> 1:22:05.936
Well, thanks.

1:22:07.470 --> 1:22:09.173
That's £18.90, please.

1:22:15.746 --> 1:22:16.780
Thanks.

1:22:24.654 --> 1:22:26.657
- Brian?
- <i>Listen, Jan. It's your dad.</i>

1:22:26.689 --> 1:22:28.692
<i>I'm sorry. I've called
an ambulance, but...</i>

1:22:28.725 --> 1:22:29.927
I'm two minutes away.

1:26:46.082 --> 1:26:47.518
Well, there he is.

1:26:57.560 --> 1:26:59.496
Oh, good God.

1:27:07.770 --> 1:27:11.509
You said he could walk.
But is he really up to being ridden?

1:27:36.832 --> 1:27:39.036
Oh, he's going
pretty well, isn't he?

1:27:41.637 --> 1:27:43.006
Well done, boy.

1:27:47.911 --> 1:27:50.248
Unbelievable!

1:27:54.251 --> 1:27:56.020
My God.

1:28:11.702 --> 1:28:15.139
- I swear he winked at me.
- It's miraculous.

1:28:15.171 --> 1:28:17.640
The stem cell treatment
was a complete success.

1:28:17.673 --> 1:28:19.777
The vet thinks
the tendon's stronger now

1:28:19.810 --> 1:28:22.046
than before the injury.
He's running faster than ever.

1:28:22.078 --> 1:28:24.347
How come you never mentioned
he was coming on so well?

1:28:24.381 --> 1:28:27.685
Didn't want to raise any false
hopes until we were sure.

1:28:27.717 --> 1:28:29.619
Of what?

1:28:30.319 --> 1:28:32.755
We think he's ready
to race again.

1:28:32.788 --> 1:28:36.292
- You're joking.
- We're thinking The Welsh National.

1:28:36.326 --> 1:28:40.030
- That would be incredible.
- But after all he's been through...

1:28:42.966 --> 1:28:45.936
I need to be sure
it's what you want.

1:28:51.774 --> 1:28:54.110
I can't bear the thought
of him risking his life again!

1:28:57.146 --> 1:29:00.350
I just don't think we can take the risk.
Not after all that's happened.

1:29:00.384 --> 1:29:02.286
But it'd be the comeback
of all comebacks!

1:29:02.319 --> 1:29:04.822
That's rich. You were ready
to write him off.

1:29:04.854 --> 1:29:07.991
- We'd all written him off.
- You saw him on the gallops.

1:29:08.024 --> 1:29:10.893
And you heard what Philip Hobbs said.
It's miraculous.

1:29:10.926 --> 1:29:14.998
I mean, surely it's a sign.
Dream wants to keep going.

1:29:15.032 --> 1:29:17.668
- He lives to race.
- It's in his blood, innit?

1:29:17.701 --> 1:29:20.637
Out on that track,
when he was hurt,

1:29:20.671 --> 1:29:23.908
you said we owed him a chance
because of what he'd done for us.

1:29:25.141 --> 1:29:28.345
What was that chance for if
not to let him race again?

1:29:28.377 --> 1:29:31.180
But not at The Welsh Grand National.
It's too dangerous.

1:29:31.213 --> 1:29:34.018
Tell him, Brian.
It's just too big a risk.

1:29:36.853 --> 1:29:38.154
I would, Jan.

1:29:39.155 --> 1:29:41.257
But I can see
what they're saying.

1:29:54.970 --> 1:29:56.206
How could you?

1:30:07.317 --> 1:30:09.319
That's why I'm single, see?

1:30:22.932 --> 1:30:24.301
Jan.

1:30:24.333 --> 1:30:26.970
- I thought you cared about Dream.
- I do.

1:30:28.904 --> 1:30:31.041
Of course I care about him.

1:30:32.375 --> 1:30:37.014
When Dream come along,
took me right back to when I was young.

1:30:38.414 --> 1:30:40.184
Wanting to be a farmer.

1:30:43.987 --> 1:30:47.123
All those hopes
I'd given up on.

1:30:47.157 --> 1:30:50.461
And it hurt like hell when he
went to live at the stables.

1:30:52.462 --> 1:30:55.966
Almost as much as it hurt
when he fell at Aintree.

1:30:58.135 --> 1:31:00.838
You spoke for him then,
when he couldn't.

1:31:00.871 --> 1:31:04.007
But if Dream was here now
and he could speak...

1:31:05.307 --> 1:31:08.278
...he'd tell you
he wants to race.

1:31:10.079 --> 1:31:11.716
It's in his blood.

1:31:14.451 --> 1:31:16.220
You know I'm right.

1:31:18.020 --> 1:31:19.823
Let him run, Jan.

1:31:21.123 --> 1:31:24.427
I just can't bear the thought
of him getting hurt again.

1:31:24.461 --> 1:31:25.829
I know.

1:31:27.029 --> 1:31:29.198
But you were right.

1:31:29.231 --> 1:31:33.770
We can't stop ourselves from
dreaming of bigger things.

1:31:44.046 --> 1:31:45.081
Come on, love.

1:31:47.149 --> 1:31:48.451
Come on.

1:32:43.239 --> 1:32:44.375
There you go.

1:32:45.041 --> 1:32:46.409
See ya.

1:32:46.443 --> 1:32:48.512
Hey, Kerby.
Where's your glad rags?

1:32:48.545 --> 1:32:50.881
You better get a shift on,
mate, or you'll miss the coach.

1:32:50.913 --> 1:32:52.550
I'm not going.
Can't afford it, butt.

1:32:53.649 --> 1:32:56.219
You gotta come.
Come, we'll have a whip-round.

1:32:56.252 --> 1:33:00.122
Bugger off. I'll put the money
I'm saving by not going on Dream.

1:33:00.155 --> 1:33:02.525
Twenty quid,
Dream Alliance to win.

1:33:03.894 --> 1:33:06.630
I'll watch it in the club
with a pint in my hand.

1:33:06.662 --> 1:33:10.033
Now, you tell our boy
to run the race of his life.

1:33:11.001 --> 1:33:12.369
Right, I'm off.

1:33:15.404 --> 1:33:17.073
Why are you all...

1:33:17.106 --> 1:33:19.475
We thought we might come along, too.

1:33:21.310 --> 1:33:22.979
What the hell is that?

1:33:23.012 --> 1:33:25.582
What do you reckon?

1:33:25.614 --> 1:33:28.585
Angela and the kids in there.
Howard, you're lying down in the hearse.

1:33:28.618 --> 1:33:31.555
I couldn't fit you all in the coach!
We had to think laterally!

1:33:31.587 --> 1:33:33.657
- Come on. Follow me.
- In you go, love.

1:37:10.239 --> 1:37:12.675
<i>Looking
a little bit unsettled.</i>

1:37:12.708 --> 1:37:14.644
Oh, God, there he is.

1:37:16.279 --> 1:37:18.482
<i>His ruptured tendon the cause
of his nerves, perhaps.</i>

1:37:18.515 --> 1:37:19.682
<i>Understandable.</i>

<i>Le Beau Bai, number nine,</i>

Come on, man.

1:38:05.895 --> 1:38:09.833
<i>The flag drops and we're
off on this Welsh Grand National!</i>

1:38:09.865 --> 1:38:13.336
<i>A grueling race that has seen

1:38:13.368 --> 1:38:15.604

<i>Leading now is Operation
Houdini, in the yellow and black.</i>

<i>Having work to do at the rear of the

1:38:26.315 --> 1:38:27.917

<i>As they head
into the first bend,</i>

1:38:30.453 --> 1:38:33.290
<i>Operation Houdini still holds

1:38:33.323 --> 1:38:36.459
- He's coming over the rise down there.
- Come on, man.

1:38:36.492 --> 1:38:40.363
<i>The pack are now climbing
steeply on this punishing course.</i>

1:38:40.395 --> 1:38:43.866
<i>Ahead of them looms the
challenge of the first fence.</i>

1:38:55.377 --> 1:38:57.246
Coming to the first now.
Here we are.

1:39:02.952 --> 1:39:04.354
Come on, Dream!

1:39:12.395 --> 1:39:14.932
<i>Dream Alliance still the back
marker approaching the second fence.</i>

1:39:22.438 --> 1:39:23.606
He's got it!

1:39:34.317 --> 1:39:35.851
<i>And they're all over clear.</i>

1:39:39.988 --> 1:39:42.925
<i>Approaching the far bend,
Operation Houdini slipping away.</i>

1:39:42.958 --> 1:39:44.527
Come on, lad.

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:46.296
Come on, my boy.

1:39:46.328 --> 1:39:48.864
<i>Dream Alliance looks like
he's making a move!</i>

1:39:48.898 --> 1:39:51.868
<i>Muscling through, pushing Cornish
Chef then Nositch out of the way.</i>

1:39:51.900 --> 1:39:54.871
- He's away!
- Go, Dream!

1:39:54.904 --> 1:39:56.906
<i>The pack rounding the far bend</i>

1:39:56.939 --> 1:40:00.543
<i>and Dream Alliance sneaks past
Hello Bud and Old Benny.</i>

1:40:01.711 --> 1:40:02.746
Go on, boy!

1:40:07.817 --> 1:40:09.752
Look, Jan!

1:40:09.786 --> 1:40:13.657
<i>Dream Alliance battling his
way past Operation Houdini</i>

1:40:13.689 --> 1:40:15.457
<i>as he barges
into second place!</i>

1:40:15.490 --> 1:40:16.926
<i>This is incredible!</i>

1:40:19.662 --> 1:40:23.432
<i>Silver By Nature has got a
real scrap on his hands now!</i>

1:40:32.074 --> 1:40:34.778
<i>Dream Alliance and Silver
By Nature locked in a duel</i>

1:40:34.810 --> 1:40:36.545
<i>as they approach
the second to last.</i>

1:40:40.716 --> 1:40:42.685
Come on, boy! Come on!

1:40:47.122 --> 1:40:50.760
<i>Dream Alliance tightening every
sinew as they take the final jump.</i>

1:40:52.561 --> 1:40:55.931
<i>A slip by Silver By Nature,
and Dream Alliance lands ahead</i>

1:40:55.965 --> 1:40:59.036
<i>and steals the lead for the
very first time in the race!</i>

1:41:01.871 --> 1:41:04.541
- Yes, yes!
- Come on!

1:41:04.573 --> 1:41:06.742
<i>Dream Alliance in first place,</i>

1:41:06.775 --> 1:41:09.378
<i>but Silver By Nature
is fighting back!</i>

1:41:12.481 --> 1:41:14.117
<i>He's pulling away
from Dream Alliance!</i>

1:41:14.149 --> 1:41:15.885
Go, my boy!

1:41:21.090 --> 1:41:23.659
<i>Both horses giving it
everything they've got.</i>

1:41:23.693 --> 1:41:26.096
- My boy!
- <i>Dream Alliance pulling ahead!</i>

1:41:27.896 --> 1:41:30.065
- Go on!
- <i>The boy from the valleys</i>

1:41:30.099 --> 1:41:32.436
<i>proving he's up there
with the best in the world!</i>

1:41:33.703 --> 1:41:34.938
Go, Dream!

1:41:56.057 --> 1:41:57.360
Hey!

1:42:09.104 --> 1:42:11.740
<i>First place, Dream Alliance.</i>

1:42:11.774 --> 1:42:15.612
<i>A fairy-tale return from injury to
conquer this Welsh Grand National!</i>

1:42:15.645 --> 1:42:17.514
Oh, lovely!

1:42:17.546 --> 1:42:19.481
Dream, Dream, Dream!

1:42:19.515 --> 1:42:20.650
Yay!

1:42:25.887 --> 1:42:29.393
I bloody knew he was a
champion right from the start!

1:42:31.993 --> 1:42:33.429
You did it.

1:42:35.163 --> 1:42:36.800
Hey, well done, girl.

1:42:38.701 --> 1:42:39.735
Well done.

1:42:52.148 --> 1:42:56.653
<i>Please give a rapturous welcome
to the horse born on an allotment</i>

1:42:56.685 --> 1:43:01.056
<i>and now the Welsh Grand National
champion, Dream Alliance!</i>

1:43:06.628 --> 1:43:08.664
Come on, Dreamy boy!

1:43:11.199 --> 1:43:15.505
You gorgeous, clever,
lion-hearted boy, you.

1:43:15.537 --> 1:43:16.972
Well done!

1:43:17.006 --> 1:43:18.608
Well done.

1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:21.176
I told you
he's got spirit.

1:43:21.210 --> 1:43:23.712
Who'd have thought, eh?
Well done.

1:43:23.746 --> 1:43:26.114
- Oh, thank you.
- Bloody well done.

1:43:26.148 --> 1:43:28.452
Yes!

1:43:30.853 --> 1:43:33.722
- Oh, Maldwyn's crying.
- No, I'm not.

1:43:33.756 --> 1:43:34.891
Where's Howard?

1:43:54.210 --> 1:43:55.511
Howard?

1:43:57.813 --> 1:43:58.847
All right?

1:43:58.881 --> 1:44:00.150
Yeah.

1:44:00.716 --> 1:44:01.785
Yeah.

1:44:02.618 --> 1:44:03.987
Just needed a moment.

1:44:04.886 --> 1:44:06.655
Quiet word with Dad...

1:44:07.989 --> 1:44:09.960
about how this win
was for him.

1:44:16.198 --> 1:44:18.168
He'd be very proud.

1:44:22.104 --> 1:44:24.140
Dream's a beauty, isn't he?

1:44:25.341 --> 1:44:27.043
Proper valleys boy.

1:44:54.837 --> 1:44:56.573
Hey, best day of my life!

1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:00.844
