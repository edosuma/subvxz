Executive producer Kim woo-taek

00:46.922 --> 00:49.216
A woojoo film production

00:50.383 --> 00:51.777
a han jae-rim film

00:51.802 --> 00:54.826
you know the smiling
hahoe masks of andong?

00:54.851 --> 00:55.781
Yes.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.600
Know why it's smiling?

01:00.018 --> 01:03.689
To symbolize humor in life?

01:03.772 --> 01:04.772
Nope.

01:05.608 --> 01:07.359
Let's smile? Be happy?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.987
What's andong famous for?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.405
Spicy chicken?

01:12.615 --> 01:15.283
Not food! A special product.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.411
Hemp cloth?

01:18.871 --> 01:20.539
Textile to make clothes?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.165
- Right.
- Hemp.

01:22.833 --> 01:27.755
Hemp is made out of
marijuana, you know?

01:28.380 --> 01:32.384
The whole town is filled with
marijuana fields.

01:32.885 --> 01:36.680
Farmers would gather
to smoke it and get high.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.766
It wasn't illegal back then.

01:39.391 --> 01:43.604
That's why the
hahoe mask is smiling.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.356
Because they are high!

01:46.690 --> 01:49.652
The whole town is!

01:51.319 --> 01:52.696
I heard that too.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.240
- Junkies all gather...
- Yes?

01:55.991 --> 01:59.244
For marijuana in September.

01:59.787 --> 02:06.251
After the harvest, marijuana must
be burnt in front of the local official.

02:06.459 --> 02:10.964
All local officials fight for
the spot to sniff it.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.717
Shouldn't we go?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.429
Let's go and sniff it!

02:19.848 --> 02:21.308
Shall we?

02:21.850 --> 02:23.894
- Be like the mask?
- Yes!

02:24.102 --> 02:25.896
- Get high?
- Let's go!

02:25.979 --> 02:27.122
I'll make a u-turn.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.356
Go!

02:45.248 --> 02:49.169
When I was six, mom couldn't
stand dad and left.

02:49.599 --> 02:51.296
She used to say...

02:51.964 --> 02:54.341
If you do bad things,
you'll go to hell.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.636
Adults are always right.

02:59.555 --> 03:03.433
I really wanted to live
like a king.

03:07.771 --> 03:12.442
Some say your life flashes past
when you're about to die.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.988
It's happening now.

04:22.012 --> 04:28.602
the nation wishes president chun
a successful tour to Burma...

04:28.644 --> 04:30.669
Wow! Is this a color TV?

04:30.813 --> 04:32.565
Yes. My dad bought it.

04:32.690 --> 04:34.525
It's nice!

04:35.150 --> 04:37.110
My dad was a crook.

04:38.028 --> 04:42.115
When color tvs were rare,
he went around to steal them.

04:43.158 --> 04:48.710
He stole anything that was worthy.
Like radios and rice cookers...

04:50.498 --> 04:54.587
He'd sell the stolen goods
to women at markets.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.004
Bring my money!

04:57.005 --> 04:59.800
Win 3 times your bet!

05:01.844 --> 05:06.682
He was a crook living a trashy life.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.102
Kids, know what this is?
Chicken!

05:10.143 --> 05:12.479
But he'd bring home
some chicken...

05:12.813 --> 05:17.651
And said I should learn to drink
from him and tried to be a dad.

05:22.698 --> 05:27.327
Seeing si-yeon with a guy
reminded him of mom running away...

05:27.786 --> 05:29.246
Dad couldn't stand it.

05:30.623 --> 05:31.623
Go!

05:31.915 --> 05:32.499
Stop it!

05:32.500 --> 05:35.252
But mom left because
he cheated on her.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.507
Who's the big guy here!

05:46.639 --> 05:50.058
What did I learn from
my troublemaking dad?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.853
Nothing but fighting.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.192
Life may seem easy
for a top fighter in school...

05:59.860 --> 06:06.241
But defending my title wasn't easy.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.084
Choi du-il

06:32.560 --> 06:35.778
Night school is nice.
You get to go late.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.900
A cop is at your place.
What did your dad do this time?

06:40.233 --> 06:43.028
How much will he pay off
this time?

06:49.785 --> 06:52.079
Mr. Prosecutor, I'm sorry!

06:52.162 --> 06:55.958
Please forgive me!

06:56.041 --> 06:57.042
How dare you!

06:57.125 --> 06:57.976
Please, sir!

06:58.001 --> 06:59.520
My dad was getting hit...

06:59.545 --> 07:01.630
By a man he can easily defeat.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.381
I'll lock you up!

07:03.465 --> 07:06.261
Mr. Prosecutor,
I can't go to prison now.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.929
Prosecutor?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.766
The man who's slapping
my dad is a prosecutor.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.436
That's real power.

07:17.813 --> 07:20.524
Sentencing people for life...

07:20.774 --> 07:22.526
Or even death!

07:23.652 --> 07:26.989
Dad is kneeling down
because he is a prosecutor.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.577
Fighting rules only in school.

07:31.910 --> 07:36.289
Eventually, those nerds will
own the real power.

07:37.207 --> 07:41.545
That's when I decided
to become a prosecutor.

07:41.962 --> 07:46.466
If the upcoming
1988 Olympics goes well...

07:46.509 --> 07:50.638
Korea will be marked as
a developed country.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.056
So study hard!

07:53.098 --> 07:54.391
Don't wake him.

07:55.017 --> 07:58.646
Who'd do the dirty jobs if
everyone become prosecutors?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.731
Will you? Let him sleep.

08:01.690 --> 08:05.861
But a crook's son becoming
a prosecutor was not easy.

08:06.779 --> 08:11.617
I never studied in my life,
so books made me fall asleep.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.998
Is something wrong?

08:18.624 --> 08:19.875
No.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.251
Tell me!

08:21.960 --> 08:26.965
I should study for my exams,
but I want to dance.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.134
Then study here!

08:29.718 --> 08:31.053
Here?

08:31.929 --> 08:35.222
They're reading comics.
Why not books?

08:44.399 --> 08:46.026
What on earth!

08:46.819 --> 08:50.864
I couldn't study at a desk,
but I could concentrate here!

08:54.993 --> 09:00.874
I can't stand silence
so I studied better with distractions.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.043
They call it white noise.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.422
I could focus better
with some noise.

09:17.641 --> 09:18.642
Really!

09:19.518 --> 09:20.644
Seriously!

09:21.353 --> 09:22.980
Park tae-su!

09:23.856 --> 09:26.984
Your grades went up a lot.

09:27.526 --> 09:31.947
From 53rd to 12th?
You went up 40 places?

09:31.989 --> 09:35.450
You tried real hard, huh?
See for yourself.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.495
Like your grades?

09:40.038 --> 09:41.665
You tried really hard!

09:41.915 --> 09:43.083
You fool!

09:43.250 --> 09:47.045
You cheated?
Don't you have a conscience?

09:47.129 --> 09:47.880
I didn't cheat!

09:47.881 --> 09:52.509
How dare you! Come here.

09:52.510 --> 09:53.343
Damn it!

09:53.344 --> 09:57.806
Who did you copy from?

09:57.973 --> 09:59.306
Sorry for doubting you.

09:59.307 --> 10:03.103
- See? I didn't cheat!
- Right.

10:03.145 --> 10:06.732
When I took the test alone
and still did well...

10:07.024 --> 10:09.652
He apologized
and bought me food.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.325
Exam rank 1: Park tae-su

10:18.577 --> 10:20.424
park tae-su!

10:20.538 --> 10:23.165
I got into Seoul university.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.468
Aren't you protesting?

10:36.637 --> 10:38.972
Since everybody does,
I guess I should.

10:39.264 --> 10:43.727
That won't change anything.
Isn't it pathetic?

10:44.311 --> 10:46.063
I wouldn't say that.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.320
Why me!

10:56.740 --> 10:57.950
Let go!

11:01.078 --> 11:02.412
Yeon-sil!

11:04.414 --> 11:05.749
Yeon-sil!

11:08.836 --> 11:10.128
Yeon-sil!

11:10.337 --> 11:13.757
Tae-su! I'm sorry!

11:14.174 --> 11:20.222
She turned out to be the
wanted protestor leader.

11:21.599 --> 11:25.227
Then I got dragged into the army
for helping her escape.

11:25.310 --> 11:29.648
A Seoul university law student
should know better!

11:31.149 --> 11:32.192
Hometown!

11:33.235 --> 11:33.986
Pardon?

11:34.069 --> 11:35.112
Your hometown!

11:35.403 --> 11:39.407
Dad warned me to never say
that my hometown was jeolla-do.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.368
I'm from Seoul, sir!

11:43.328 --> 11:45.247
It says jeolla-do.

11:45.831 --> 11:50.002
That's my father's hometown.
I was born in Seoul.

11:50.418 --> 11:54.297
If you're from jeolla-do,
they'll brand you as a commie.

11:54.764 --> 11:57.391
So I listened to him.

11:58.421 --> 12:01.592
Thanks to that,
I was placed in a laid back base.

12:07.031 --> 12:10.063
I kept studying.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.250
Until my discharge,
I studied for the bar exam...

12:13.275 --> 12:16.153
And went into examiners'
housing afterwards.

12:20.533 --> 12:26.038
People were stuck inside
to study for years...

12:26.705 --> 12:31.376
Dreaming of a fancy life
after passing the bar.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.089
Evidence 1.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.426
Cash used for illegal gambling
and drug trade.

12:40.392 --> 12:41.428
Evidence 2.

12:41.839 --> 12:44.749
Weapons used for threats.

12:44.848 --> 12:50.813
Someday I'll be a prosecutor
spotlighted on TV.

12:52.064 --> 12:57.861
We're pleased to root out
the smugglers and...

12:59.572 --> 13:02.449
I got lucky in passing
the first round.

13:02.991 --> 13:06.829
Then we're given two chances
to pass the second round.

13:07.380 --> 13:13.469
I took it once to get a feel for it,
then kept studying.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.667
Oh shit!

13:23.136 --> 13:24.847
Excuse me!

13:24.930 --> 13:25.930
Park tae-su

13:25.973 --> 13:27.390
I passed!

13:28.141 --> 13:32.563
Passing the second round
meant I passed the bar.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.608
No. 235, park tae-su!

13:35.733 --> 13:39.152
Why did you take the bar exam?

13:39.444 --> 13:42.197
The third round is the interview.

13:42.698 --> 13:44.324
Son of a bitch!

13:45.158 --> 13:49.371
Unless I slap their face,
I'll pass for sure.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.876
Look!

13:53.917 --> 13:55.168
Smile!

13:58.964 --> 14:01.717
Look! The bus is here!

14:03.135 --> 14:09.683
Park myung-hoon's son, tae-su,
passed the 33rd judicial bar!

14:13.145 --> 14:14.647
Tae-su!

14:30.378 --> 14:31.797
After the bar...

14:32.080 --> 14:36.293
We're trained for 2 years
at the judicial training institute.

14:36.459 --> 14:40.422
As soon as we went in,
marriage brokers hounded us.

14:40.589 --> 14:45.553
We got tempted with wealth
and women beyond our dreams!

14:49.240 --> 14:51.659
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

14:51.684 --> 14:56.188
She was late too,
but the man should be early!

14:57.342 --> 14:59.191
So sorry.

15:00.413 --> 15:03.792
This is park tae-su,
from Seoul university.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.573
Isn't he handsome?

15:11.287 --> 15:12.454
It was her.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.628
I signaled!

15:20.128 --> 15:23.591
- Still, you can't just cut in!
- You crazy!

15:23.882 --> 15:26.885
- Are you a gangster?
- What if I am!

15:28.303 --> 15:30.681
Try it! Hit me!

15:30.823 --> 15:31.448
Geeze!

15:31.473 --> 15:33.225
- Move your cars.
- What?

15:33.350 --> 15:37.605
Move your cars then fight!
You're blocking traffic!

15:37.688 --> 15:39.314
What the hell?

15:39.857 --> 15:42.651
Come out here, bitch!

15:50.423 --> 15:52.760
I'm out. What now?

16:03.589 --> 16:07.760
How dare you raise
a hand at a woman!

16:10.470 --> 16:11.930
Move it!

16:25.152 --> 16:27.195
Why are you leaving?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.907
No need to waste time.

16:30.785 --> 16:31.785
What?

16:31.942 --> 16:34.737
You folks like the
submissive type.

16:35.408 --> 16:40.664
Dad forced me out here.
I thought I'd pretend to be good.

16:41.919 --> 16:46.840
But you saw me,
so let's not waste our time.

16:47.841 --> 16:52.054
But I don't like
kind and quiet girls.

16:59.895 --> 17:03.023
We drank 7 bottles
of vodka that night.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.858
We fell for each other completely.

17:06.193 --> 17:09.738
We made love like lovers
who haven't met in years.

17:10.573 --> 17:13.867
We were hungry for love.

17:15.536 --> 17:20.165
We got married after 6 months,
as I officially became a prosecutor.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.417
She almost married someone else.

17:23.627 --> 17:28.006
But when her father got charged
with $7 million for embezzlement...

17:28.298 --> 17:31.760
He was against her marrying
anyone but a prosecutor.

17:32.260 --> 17:37.307
Then she went on blind dates
with countless prosecutors.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.267
She was glad to meet me.

17:40.185 --> 17:43.480
She said she loved
my mischievous eyes.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.616
My life changed completely.

17:55.283 --> 17:59.580
Still, I couldn't start on the job
in a Jaguar.

17:59.997 --> 18:02.875
People have eyes.

18:09.882 --> 18:14.803
Being a prosecutor was tougher
than I thought.

18:15.387 --> 18:18.932
From drunk driving to hit-and-runs...

18:19.349 --> 18:23.436
A prosecutor dealt
with 30 cases per day.

18:23.958 --> 18:28.191
I spent the whole day
reading cases.

18:28.609 --> 18:33.321
Being a prosecutor is hard.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.535
Poor pay and long hours.

18:37.993 --> 18:41.830
We're civil servants.
Nothing special.

18:42.164 --> 18:48.253
99% of prosecutors work
even on weekends with low pay.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.508
Is there no prosecutor
with real power?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.637
I found out about
the 1% of prosecutors...

18:57.095 --> 19:01.349
After 2 years of hard labor
and weight loss.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.395
What's this?

19:05.521 --> 19:06.605
What?

19:07.480 --> 19:11.777
A teacher sexually assaulted
a student, but they settled?

19:12.110 --> 19:13.696
This isn't right.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.699
She's a minor.
He should be imprisoned.

19:17.365 --> 19:23.371
His father is a local bigwig here.

19:23.956 --> 19:24.957
What?

19:26.416 --> 19:29.962
A former congressman with money.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.258
What do ji-min's parents do?

19:36.030 --> 19:40.848
Her single mom is a street vendor.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.602
She's a bit mentally disabled.

19:44.935 --> 19:48.856
That's why the settlement is just...

19:54.987 --> 19:56.905
Most people...

19:57.364 --> 20:02.494
Acted like gentle lambs,
afraid of being punished.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.414
But he was different.

20:08.041 --> 20:14.632
Honestly, the bastard's
arrogance bothered me.

20:17.134 --> 20:19.762
How dare he? I'm a prosecutor.

20:22.515 --> 20:25.142
- Look, Mr. Song baek-ho.
- Yes?

20:26.560 --> 20:30.814
You sexually molested ji-min 5 times
and assaulted her twice.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.027
As a teacher...

20:35.443 --> 20:40.115
I just massaged
her cramped leg muscles.

20:40.699 --> 20:46.413
If you don't massage it,
it's bad for her growth.

20:46.580 --> 20:49.499
We already settled.
Why bring me in here?

20:49.583 --> 20:54.129
You tricked her mom
and bullied ji-min into settling!

20:54.212 --> 20:55.714
The evidence is all here!

20:57.716 --> 20:59.176
Don't deny it!

21:01.344 --> 21:02.763
Prosecutor park?

21:03.430 --> 21:07.309
Is this because you're new here?

21:07.810 --> 21:09.477
- What?
- Look.

21:09.770 --> 21:13.023
Is it because
I didn't treat you yet?

21:14.650 --> 21:18.403
Then I'll set a date soon.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.488
How dare you!

21:20.573 --> 21:22.199
Throw him in jail!

21:22.575 --> 21:24.910
- I'll have him behind bars.
- What?

21:24.993 --> 21:26.161
Book him!

21:27.538 --> 21:28.831
Let's go!

21:29.707 --> 21:31.499
Fine! Let go!

21:32.209 --> 21:33.794
Damn!

21:34.377 --> 21:36.379
Ma'am?

21:37.047 --> 21:41.009
You can't settle like this.
Just $5,000?

21:41.384 --> 21:43.596
How can she sell food here?

21:43.846 --> 21:46.974
He deserves to rot in prison.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.226
It's okay.

21:49.727 --> 21:52.563
Ji-min was sad.

21:53.522 --> 22:01.404
He gave money.
I wanted it to end soon.

22:02.280 --> 22:06.619
He said he was massaging
my cramped muscles.

22:06.827 --> 22:08.202
But...

22:08.203 --> 22:10.205
That wasn't it.

22:10.623 --> 22:13.125
It wasn't a massage.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.128
He touched more than that.

22:16.419 --> 22:20.048
The principal told us
to write a statement.

22:20.215 --> 22:24.678
He threatened us to write
Mr. Song didn't do anything.

22:25.638 --> 22:28.140
The school is on his side.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.184
No one believes me.

22:32.895 --> 22:34.938
It's so unfair.

22:35.648 --> 22:38.066
I don't want to see him again.

22:45.323 --> 22:47.618
I got enough witnesses.

22:47.743 --> 22:50.663
And the sperm results...

22:52.372 --> 22:55.375
Rot for 3 years, jerk.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.763
Geeze!

23:08.430 --> 23:11.308
- Scared me!
- Sir!

23:11.391 --> 23:13.977
Almost had a heart attack.

23:14.061 --> 23:17.064
- Hi, tae-su!
- Sir...

23:17.189 --> 23:19.817
- How've you been?
- What brings you to yeoju?

23:19.900 --> 23:20.984
You scared me.

23:21.068 --> 23:23.403
I came to see you.

23:24.279 --> 23:27.575
Look at all the files.

23:27.783 --> 23:30.160
Must be rough, tae-su.

23:31.328 --> 23:32.037
It's okay.

23:32.245 --> 23:35.165
You're class of '85, right?

23:36.458 --> 23:37.501
Yes.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.503
I'm '83.

23:40.087 --> 23:42.005
I know, sir.

23:42.172 --> 23:45.300
Should've looked after you more.

23:45.383 --> 23:46.677
It's okay, sir.

23:47.595 --> 23:50.514
How about a late-night snack?

23:51.223 --> 23:52.223
Pardon?

23:52.516 --> 23:53.809
A snack.

24:17.415 --> 24:18.792
Come on in.

24:22.045 --> 24:25.007
- First time at strategics department?
- Yes.

24:25.799 --> 24:29.261
I haven't been here long either.

24:40.648 --> 24:41.648
Look.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.275
Know what's in here?

24:50.282 --> 24:51.950
They're all cases.

24:52.951 --> 24:55.954
Cases that will turn the country
upside down.

24:58.456 --> 25:02.545
Know why we just keep them here?

25:05.005 --> 25:07.591
We're waiting for them to ripen.

25:09.342 --> 25:10.342
What?

25:11.053 --> 25:16.433
Let cases ripen and
eat it when it's time.

25:17.768 --> 25:20.688
You handle 150 cases a week, right?

25:21.313 --> 25:23.398
Do anyone notice?

25:25.025 --> 25:26.025
Strategics department,
imprisons 355 criminals.

25:26.026 --> 25:27.360
See?

25:27.611 --> 25:31.657
Pull out a big case
at the right time.

25:31.740 --> 25:36.870
Then you get on newspapers
and get promoted.

25:37.663 --> 25:40.248
Know prosecutor han kang-sik?

25:41.249 --> 25:44.962
Of course.
What prosecutor doesn't?

25:45.754 --> 25:48.090
He's our department chief.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.515
I envy you.

26:00.644 --> 26:03.590
Wanna come into our team?

26:05.023 --> 26:06.149
What?

26:06.358 --> 26:07.818
I'll recommend you.

26:09.444 --> 26:10.529
Really?

26:12.364 --> 26:14.324
But under one condition.

26:15.951 --> 26:19.788
Drop ji-min's case.

26:21.915 --> 26:22.915
What?

26:23.041 --> 26:26.253
I know song baek-ho
is a bastard.

26:26.754 --> 26:30.215
But his father and
chief han have ties.

26:30.549 --> 26:34.678
As his junior staff,
I should help out.

26:35.971 --> 26:40.768
So please, let the case go.

26:43.270 --> 26:49.610
But sir...
I have my reasons to charge him.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.363
You're a prosecutor.

26:53.864 --> 26:55.533
You have pride.

26:57.826 --> 26:59.578
- I'll kneel.
- No, sir!

26:59.662 --> 27:02.706
- I'll beg you, tae-su.
- Please.

27:03.338 --> 27:04.507
Get up, sir.

27:08.045 --> 27:09.672
Tae-su.

27:10.338 --> 27:12.465
Pride is nothing.

27:12.716 --> 27:16.094
We all went to Seoul university
and passed the bar.

27:17.387 --> 27:20.098
Look at the bigger picture.

27:21.183 --> 27:25.228
Get in the right clique
and you're set for life.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.067
Sit down here.

27:35.698 --> 27:37.074
Know cha mi-ryeon?

27:37.533 --> 27:39.827
The innocent and beautiful actress.

27:45.621 --> 27:47.372
She used philopon.

27:48.919 --> 27:51.463
If this gets out,
people will flip.

27:52.673 --> 27:54.592
We're saving it.

27:55.258 --> 27:58.596
It's perfect to turn
the media's attention away.

28:00.097 --> 28:05.393
Knowing when to drop
and expose is critical.

28:06.061 --> 28:11.316
Prosecutors must do it right
to succeed.

28:12.818 --> 28:16.530
Now is the time
to drop your case.

28:18.574 --> 28:19.992
Think it over.

28:20.427 --> 28:24.306
An opportunity like this
doesn't come easy.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.780
Tae-su.

28:58.656 --> 29:01.033
You'll just sit and watch...

29:04.586 --> 29:09.382
When you want it badly?

29:11.822 --> 29:13.448
Drop the case and join.

29:15.548 --> 29:17.299
You know you want it.

29:59.842 --> 30:06.223
One, two, three...

30:06.264 --> 30:14.264
Your settlement was $5000,
but he raised it to $50,000.

30:16.399 --> 30:17.901
10 times more.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.904
You can stop working.

30:20.946 --> 30:22.990
You can go now.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.952
Take the money.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.331
Mr. Prosecutor?

30:32.249 --> 30:34.042
Let's have drinks sometime.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.553
About lunch...

30:45.763 --> 30:47.389
I'm not hungry.

30:47.848 --> 30:49.266
Actually...

30:49.767 --> 30:53.186
Ji-min's mom brought this
to thank you.

31:07.743 --> 31:09.244
Thank you, sir.

31:37.189 --> 31:38.691
Prosecutor park!

31:38.899 --> 31:40.526
Welcome.

31:41.318 --> 31:42.778
Good work.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.698
We saved face thanks to you.

31:47.700 --> 31:48.784
Where to?

31:49.078 --> 31:51.122
We can't party anywhere.

31:51.620 --> 31:52.955
People are watching.

31:53.455 --> 31:55.415
We're civil servants.

31:56.374 --> 31:57.751
To the...

32:00.170 --> 32:01.421
Penthouse.

32:27.698 --> 32:28.866
Let's go.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.953
We rent here to drink.
The girls are sent up.

32:33.537 --> 32:37.165
Prosecutor Yang!

32:37.541 --> 32:39.142
We call her mother-in-law.

32:39.167 --> 32:42.755
Her girls will do anything.

32:42.838 --> 32:46.216
- Hook him up tonight?
- Of course!

32:46.341 --> 32:48.051
What kind of girl do you like?

32:48.135 --> 32:50.262
He's picky.

32:50.345 --> 32:53.516
He got married recently.
He's new at this.

32:53.557 --> 32:55.142
Really?

32:55.225 --> 32:58.896
He's prosecutor woo.
Class of '94, your junior.

32:58.979 --> 33:01.774
- Hello, sir.
- Cocky fool.

33:02.315 --> 33:05.861
- Good to see you, sir!
- Hi, prosecutor Yang!

33:06.529 --> 33:10.240
Meet chairman park.
He's older but stronger than us.

33:10.533 --> 33:14.745
- Oh please!
- Strong both day and night.

33:16.454 --> 33:17.998
Know ju-ahn daily?

33:18.165 --> 33:20.458
Meet political reporter,
baek il-dong.

33:20.543 --> 33:22.102
Just call him reporter baek.

33:22.127 --> 33:23.604
He's good at striping women.

33:23.629 --> 33:26.674
Hey! I just met him!

33:30.511 --> 33:32.054
He's our senior alum.

33:32.220 --> 33:35.473
Now he's a partner at
park kings law firm.

33:37.267 --> 33:39.144
What's your name again?

33:39.227 --> 33:41.855
Choi du-il, sir. Hello, sir.

33:44.024 --> 33:45.568
He's the gofer.

33:49.738 --> 33:53.075
Everyone get up!

34:03.310 --> 34:06.313
Chief han kang-sik...

34:10.442 --> 34:13.485
He passed the bar
in his early 20s.

34:14.237 --> 34:17.074
In the war against crime,
he hit the center, mokpo.

34:17.364 --> 34:23.871
He also razed out the major
private military group.

34:26.033 --> 34:29.579
He is noted to be
the director soon.

34:29.885 --> 34:33.138
All his cases hit jackpots.

34:42.808 --> 34:45.936
Chief? He's the one
I told you about.

34:46.018 --> 34:48.438
He settled that case well.

34:48.772 --> 34:49.857
Greet him.

34:54.110 --> 34:56.362
Come over here!

35:00.653 --> 35:01.320
You've met.

35:01.660 --> 35:04.955
We meet again, prosecutor.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.875
Nice to see you here.

35:16.759 --> 35:20.053
Let things go and have fun.
Got it?

35:21.013 --> 35:23.098
Drink up you two.

35:25.376 --> 35:28.671
Drink a lot.
I'm paying for this.

35:29.229 --> 35:30.480
And...

35:31.649 --> 35:33.692
Hey!

35:34.317 --> 35:38.196
Call me if you want
these girls again.

35:39.281 --> 35:41.324
Touch them and have fun.

35:41.700 --> 35:45.077
They're hot when they're naked.

35:45.078 --> 35:48.373
- Hey!
- Damn sweet.

35:51.585 --> 35:53.712
How dare you act big?

36:06.517 --> 36:13.105
Think you own the world
as a prosecutor?

36:13.106 --> 36:14.441
I'm sorry, sir.

36:14.482 --> 36:16.694
He's new. He has convictions.

36:16.985 --> 36:18.654
Convictions?

36:19.655 --> 36:24.577
Forget useless pride
and sense of justice.

36:25.243 --> 36:26.453
Grow up.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.709
You had a hard life
from a poor family.

36:33.836 --> 36:37.464
Is it because you were in
the pro-democracy movement?

36:37.548 --> 36:39.925
I can explain that.
His girlfriend ran away...

36:40.008 --> 36:41.969
Stay out of this!

36:46.014 --> 36:50.227
Want to go back
to that shitty town?

36:51.937 --> 36:56.191
Wanna be a lawyer
and do divorce suits?

36:56.817 --> 37:00.571
Offer legal services?

37:01.279 --> 37:03.991
You studied for that?

37:04.658 --> 37:08.120
Just go with the flow of history.

37:09.747 --> 37:12.499
Must I teach you history?

37:13.917 --> 37:18.046
Forget pride.
Just stand next to the power.

37:20.024 --> 37:22.736
No good came to those
without power.

37:22.761 --> 37:26.014
No one in our history! Name one!

37:26.359 --> 37:28.779
Pro-Japanese groups?

37:28.914 --> 37:32.375
They are the ones with
wealth and authority.

37:32.910 --> 37:34.703
Independence fighters?

37:35.230 --> 37:39.484
Without their $500 pensions,
they'll starve.

37:42.505 --> 37:44.703
Naive fool.

37:45.862 --> 37:49.157
Kids these days are thoughtless.

37:52.074 --> 37:55.244
Why don't they study history?

37:55.471 --> 37:58.349
Learn from history.

38:05.169 --> 38:07.212
Damn it.

38:07.237 --> 38:12.993
It's not because he was wrong,
but that he was so damn right.

38:13.025 --> 38:18.363
Getting slapped like that
after all I did to get here...

38:19.003 --> 38:20.505
Shit.

38:23.617 --> 38:26.285
Chief! Shit!

38:28.464 --> 38:30.550
I'll do the love shot.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.112
Come on, let's drink.

38:37.261 --> 38:39.722
Let's clear things with a drink.

38:48.220 --> 38:49.638
Chief!

38:50.572 --> 38:52.448
I'll have another drink, sir.

38:52.473 --> 38:54.475
Come here, pal.

38:56.243 --> 38:57.452
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

38:59.365 --> 39:01.535
- Not bad!
- Drink up.

39:02.394 --> 39:04.396
Welcome to the club!

39:07.170 --> 39:10.132
He was famous for having balls
back in school too.

39:10.157 --> 39:12.284
That's why I recommended him.

39:12.309 --> 39:14.520
He's got it, right?

39:15.006 --> 39:16.758
Amusing.

39:16.783 --> 39:19.244
Way to go! Tae-su!

39:22.285 --> 39:25.997
This is the world I really wanted.

39:27.006 --> 39:30.927
This is becoming
the top 1% of prosecutors.

39:31.356 --> 39:35.298
They don't stay up nights
handling unnoticeable cases.

39:35.350 --> 39:38.371
They set targets,
collect data...

39:38.396 --> 39:40.607
Then bring people down.

39:41.116 --> 39:45.912
Notable prosecutors
will become directors...

39:46.298 --> 39:49.953
And even the Attorney General.

39:51.804 --> 39:53.180
Then what?

39:53.399 --> 39:56.194
Something bigger awaits.

39:56.731 --> 40:02.069
They work at enterprises
on $4 to 5 million a year.

40:03.112 --> 40:05.948
Or get into politics
as congressmen.

40:06.039 --> 40:09.371
Some become cabinet ministers
or presidential secretaries.

40:09.788 --> 40:12.875
They wield even more power.

40:13.223 --> 40:19.437
Call up juniors and seniors
for favors and have drinks.

40:20.236 --> 40:26.326
They live comfortably
with untouchable power.

40:29.047 --> 40:32.133
Chief han kang-sik!

40:33.588 --> 40:36.674
Come on!

40:38.316 --> 40:42.946
Sing a song for us!

40:42.971 --> 40:46.265
Sing! Sing!

40:46.290 --> 40:48.292
I'm standing before that line.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.930
Being han kang-sik's clique
is my biggest chance in life.

40:52.489 --> 40:55.117
Don't scowl at history.

40:55.504 --> 40:58.172
Smile at history. Smile big!

41:15.421 --> 41:19.008
She is too attractive and smart.

41:19.033 --> 41:22.703
She makes me insane. I love it!

41:33.206 --> 41:36.209
In the bus to school...

41:36.474 --> 41:39.728
I see her seated in
the same seat...

41:41.636 --> 41:46.649
Han ruled everything.
It was his world.

41:46.864 --> 41:48.574
Just say you like me.

41:48.599 --> 41:51.145
Don't be shy...

42:03.571 --> 42:04.748
Prosecutor! No...

42:04.773 --> 42:05.941
Almost forgot.

42:06.577 --> 42:08.453
We're friends now, right?

42:09.232 --> 42:11.943
It's been fun, pal.

42:13.340 --> 42:15.051
Go home.

42:15.584 --> 42:17.586
Hey! Wait!

42:18.470 --> 42:23.225
You know, ji-min's skin
feels really good.

42:23.748 --> 42:26.375
Way hotter than the girls here.

42:28.703 --> 42:31.831
What? Wanna hit me?

42:32.835 --> 42:35.796
Go on. Hit me.

42:36.379 --> 42:37.638
Go ahead.

42:37.663 --> 42:39.331
Go on.

42:39.921 --> 42:43.299
You can't hit me.

42:43.789 --> 42:45.833
Shit.

42:47.743 --> 42:49.578
I'm going.

42:51.267 --> 42:53.186
I'm going to school tomorrow.

42:53.802 --> 42:56.262
I'll see ji-min again.

42:56.287 --> 43:00.207
I love it when she says no
and cries.

43:01.332 --> 43:03.292
Son of bitch!

43:08.198 --> 43:10.283
What the hell!

43:16.050 --> 43:17.134
Who are you?

43:22.995 --> 43:24.830
Don't remember?

43:26.345 --> 43:28.556
I'm choi du-il...

43:30.589 --> 43:31.673
From mokpo.

43:31.862 --> 43:34.907
Night school is nice.
You get to go late.

43:34.990 --> 43:36.867
A cop is at your place.

43:37.075 --> 43:39.369
What did your dad do this time?

43:39.828 --> 43:44.416
He's sub-leader of wild dogs
of mokpo run by Kim eung-su.

43:45.116 --> 43:49.883
The wild dogs were below
the sunflowers gang.

43:49.917 --> 43:50.981
War against crime

43:51.006 --> 43:54.927
but when sunflowers got razed
during the war against crime...

43:55.093 --> 43:58.556
The wild dogs reached
the top in mokpo.

44:02.936 --> 44:04.479
Time to eat.

44:47.320 --> 44:51.408
Eung-su ran a slaughterhouse
to avoid a tax investigation.

44:51.618 --> 44:55.412
He paid dues
to kang-sik regularly.

44:55.937 --> 45:02.151
Han must've destroyed
the sunflowers for eung-su.

45:13.083 --> 45:17.713
Know how proud I was
when you passed the bar?

45:19.680 --> 45:23.934
A fool finally succeeded.

45:25.729 --> 45:33.729
Kids used to make bets on
who'd win if we fought.

45:34.677 --> 45:35.595
Really?

45:35.620 --> 45:36.954
Yup.

45:37.374 --> 45:41.003
Probably disappointed
we never fought.

45:41.028 --> 45:43.864
Then we should've!

45:44.520 --> 45:47.480
Well, I would've won.

45:47.807 --> 45:51.060
Come on. No way.

45:51.268 --> 45:54.313
I was better at fighting.

45:56.750 --> 45:57.835
Better?

45:59.850 --> 46:01.268
Like hell.

46:30.197 --> 46:32.742
Hey, I won.

46:33.445 --> 46:35.363
No, I won!

46:36.187 --> 46:40.609
Crazy? Get up.
Let's fight for real.

46:41.182 --> 46:43.018
Ow! My back...

46:50.029 --> 46:53.491
It's good to see you.

46:53.788 --> 46:55.373
Same here.

46:59.267 --> 47:03.605
That damn gym teacher...
What a headache.

47:04.670 --> 47:06.922
Don't worry about it.

47:07.928 --> 47:09.429
What?

47:10.152 --> 47:13.906
You stay on the bright side.

47:14.928 --> 47:21.226
I'll help you with shitty works.

47:21.251 --> 47:22.544
Trust me.

47:22.569 --> 47:26.488
You be on a bright side.
Don't dirty your hands.

47:27.117 --> 47:31.955
I did lots of dirty shit.
It don't matter for me.

47:34.048 --> 47:38.469
Like how my boss does to han,
I'll support you.

47:38.741 --> 47:42.912
So you can sail smoothly.

47:42.985 --> 47:45.487
We're hometown pals.

47:46.918 --> 47:52.507
Du-il took the injured gym teacher
straight to the police.

47:52.913 --> 47:55.874
He got 18 months in prison.

47:55.899 --> 47:57.776
What happened to the gym teacher?

47:58.126 --> 48:00.419
His balls broke,
and became a eunuch.

48:00.860 --> 48:03.321
He won't mess with girls now.

48:05.534 --> 48:09.162
Well, I had a good life before.

48:10.311 --> 48:14.691
But being in han's clique,
everything else was a child's play.

48:18.662 --> 48:20.539
This is a real prosecutor.

48:20.671 --> 48:24.257
This is the prosecutor
I dreamed of becoming.

48:33.432 --> 48:38.103
It's a new world where we plan,
investigate, and indict.

48:39.276 --> 48:41.070
My son-in-law is
now in strategics.

48:41.095 --> 48:44.181
I'm jealous! I'd better be good.

48:45.216 --> 48:47.552
We investigated people of
great scales.

48:48.733 --> 48:51.569
Our indictments always
made the frontpage.

48:51.899 --> 48:54.192
Corrupt politician charged

48:59.193 --> 49:02.488
Company owners, executives,
former cabinet ministers...

49:02.514 --> 49:04.891
All bowed to us.

49:10.931 --> 49:12.892
Sly gym teachers?

49:13.061 --> 49:15.814
Women crying and fighting?

49:16.673 --> 49:19.300
We were so beyond them.

49:21.084 --> 49:24.713
The bigwigs bowed down to us.

49:30.462 --> 49:34.883
If han selected and we investigated,
game was over.

49:38.533 --> 49:40.350
We're ready to go!

49:40.707 --> 49:42.394
Get ready!

49:42.419 --> 49:45.118
Everyone stand up!

49:45.143 --> 49:46.227
Big news!

49:46.252 --> 49:47.316
Run!

49:47.341 --> 49:50.094
Reporter baek brings press.

49:51.051 --> 49:53.804
They're coming!

49:57.860 --> 49:58.860
They're here!

50:08.467 --> 50:09.573
Han uncovers
corporate tax evasion

50:09.597 --> 50:12.739
then we'd always make
the top news.

50:14.938 --> 50:17.816
There's nothing we couldn't do.

50:18.108 --> 50:22.404
I got du-il out in 8 months,
when he was charged for 18.

50:23.930 --> 50:31.195
My wife was stuck with 6 am news
for getting on her manager's bad side.

50:31.220 --> 50:34.306
Good morning.
This is the 6 am news.

50:34.578 --> 50:38.874
But with one phone call,
she got the 6 pm news.

50:40.481 --> 50:43.651
I'm prosecutor han kang-sik.

50:50.030 --> 50:52.115
Amazing strategics team
han, Yang and park

51:03.044 --> 51:04.755
I'm driving!

51:05.562 --> 51:08.940
But there's one thing
our team couldn't control.

51:10.011 --> 51:12.221
It's family.

51:13.230 --> 51:15.482
How embarrassing!

51:18.725 --> 51:22.771
New town ownership

51:28.278 --> 51:29.315
Apartment contract

51:31.568 --> 51:34.745
- I told you not to start this!
- Don't hit him!

51:34.770 --> 51:36.605
I'm sorry, honey!

51:36.748 --> 51:39.166
So what if you're a prosecutor!

51:39.191 --> 51:43.070
Can a prosecutor hit people?

51:44.195 --> 51:47.448
You just bought me a fridge
for my wedding.

51:47.658 --> 51:48.951
How did dad raise you?

51:50.909 --> 51:53.951
He'd hit me, but not you!

51:53.976 --> 51:59.656
You only cared your wife's family,
and paid no attention to us!

51:59.681 --> 52:02.349
Of course I did!

52:02.374 --> 52:04.919
You blew all the money
I gave you!

52:04.944 --> 52:07.572
Think I wanted to blow it?

52:09.237 --> 52:13.867
So we're trying to make money
and start a restaurant.

52:13.892 --> 52:15.853
But you won't let us?

52:15.878 --> 52:18.756
Si-yeon, but still...

52:19.205 --> 52:21.492
Not like this!

52:21.525 --> 52:26.781
It's pre-construction sales.
Everyone does it!

52:26.806 --> 52:28.140
Deadline is 15th.

52:28.165 --> 52:33.449
If you pay the franchise
fees, we'll stop.

52:33.474 --> 52:36.400
I can't come up
with the money by then!

52:36.425 --> 52:39.974
- Then stay out!
- Yeah!

52:40.615 --> 52:42.158
Shit.

52:51.712 --> 52:52.712
Go! Go!

52:53.020 --> 52:54.438
Are you okay?

52:58.101 --> 53:00.020
What's with you today?

53:00.355 --> 53:03.483
I have so much energy.

53:07.096 --> 53:10.558
After 6 tennis sets
and 4 times sex, she passed out.

53:11.487 --> 53:14.532
I almost died,
but I had no choice.

53:17.974 --> 53:19.976
Here it is.

53:24.597 --> 53:26.348
Blood!

53:29.677 --> 53:32.597
'My cup overflows.'

53:36.684 --> 53:39.729
rich folks always
keep cash in the safe.

53:39.761 --> 53:43.557
They're illegal funds.
They won't know the amount.

53:47.344 --> 53:49.346
Tae-su?

53:50.475 --> 53:51.017
Huh?

53:51.202 --> 53:53.580
Wanna do it again?

53:56.802 --> 53:58.262
Why? Tired?

53:58.287 --> 54:00.832
No! Of course not.

54:02.850 --> 54:04.017
Where are you?

54:04.042 --> 54:06.011
I'll be right there!

54:07.399 --> 54:12.196
I found out later that my sister
used my hard-earned money...

54:12.661 --> 54:17.040
To open another temporary realty
without telling dad.

54:18.002 --> 54:20.088
She never listens.

54:23.038 --> 54:25.082
It was a time of great change...

54:25.107 --> 54:28.736
With new opportunity and threat.

54:28.761 --> 54:32.681
High risk and high return.
You gain a lot or lose a lot.

54:33.814 --> 54:37.192
Prosecutors are most sensitive
when administration shifts.

54:37.295 --> 54:41.340
Indeed, prosecution doesn't change
because governments do.

54:41.495 --> 54:43.789
But the power struggle changes.

54:44.020 --> 54:45.897
Which clique you're in matters.

54:52.517 --> 54:53.836
Shit!

54:54.369 --> 54:56.496
You fools worked
on it for months!

54:56.689 --> 55:00.484
The election is close but
can't tell who'll win?

55:00.510 --> 55:03.470
What the hell did you do?

55:05.606 --> 55:10.151
What if we get in the wrong line?

55:10.597 --> 55:13.058
Get to work now!

55:15.125 --> 55:17.878
Why'd I trust those idiots!

55:17.903 --> 55:20.531
Kang-sik? Who'll win?

55:20.672 --> 55:24.008
You got the Attorney General right.
Any idea?

55:24.258 --> 55:27.344
If we guess wrong,
I'll have to quit and start over.

55:27.773 --> 55:29.983
You should be the director!

55:30.049 --> 55:32.969
It's your seat after me.

55:33.405 --> 55:35.783
Yours! Kang-sik!

55:38.499 --> 55:39.960
Sir?

55:42.497 --> 55:44.833
Trust me on this one?

55:46.676 --> 55:49.197
15th presidential elections

55:49.222 --> 55:52.392
I've never seen him so nervous.

55:52.928 --> 55:55.430
He kept going to the bathroom.

55:56.504 --> 55:58.297
It was tense.

56:07.978 --> 56:12.357
Everyone desperately wanted
their candidate to win.

56:16.299 --> 56:22.471
Depending on the result,
you either got promoted or fired.

56:32.541 --> 56:34.508
Whose line did we choose?

56:45.484 --> 56:49.280
What brings you to
my daughter's recital?

56:49.305 --> 56:50.890
Have a seat.

56:51.467 --> 56:54.262
So you've decided
to join our line?

56:55.275 --> 56:56.944
Here, sir.

57:02.683 --> 57:06.144
Prosecutors are so scary.

57:06.421 --> 57:09.299
If this gets out,
the opponent will get a blow.

57:15.139 --> 57:18.893
Please remember him.
He bet his life on this.

57:18.948 --> 57:22.785
I promise you a big spot
within 2 years.

57:23.245 --> 57:24.539
Thank you, sir!

57:25.996 --> 57:28.331
How did we choose?

57:28.956 --> 57:30.791
Trust me on this one?

57:40.270 --> 57:43.481
You want more money?

57:43.594 --> 57:45.929
There are many heads
on the line.

57:46.269 --> 57:48.647
Give your best, sir.

57:50.244 --> 57:52.830
It's coming!

57:55.017 --> 57:58.604
I see it!

58:00.536 --> 58:03.455
I see the next president!

58:04.409 --> 58:06.828
20 seconds left.

58:06.853 --> 58:12.317
Who will be the next
president in 1997?

58:13.220 --> 58:15.097
10, 9...

58:15.254 --> 58:19.425
Did the shaman get it right?

58:20.460 --> 58:24.422
All our fates depended on it.

58:26.808 --> 58:28.643
Who is it?

58:28.668 --> 58:30.169
Dae-jung! Dae-jung!

58:30.521 --> 58:31.939
President Kim dae-jung elected

58:31.964 --> 58:36.385
yes! He won!

58:42.093 --> 58:46.902
Yes! Yes! Yes!

58:48.948 --> 58:51.701
Department 3 hit the jackpot.

58:53.341 --> 58:55.301
We're so screwed.

58:56.325 --> 58:59.203
Han kang-sik! You did it!

59:04.013 --> 59:05.306
Tae-su!

59:05.331 --> 59:06.583
Du-il!

59:06.812 --> 59:09.189
Let's party like hell tonight!

01:00:51.761 --> 01:00:54.221
You know our president.

01:00:54.537 --> 01:00:58.498
Fought against dictatorship
for democracy...

01:00:58.847 --> 01:01:01.633
Endured all kinds of hardship.

01:01:02.483 --> 01:01:06.195
Abduction, torture...
He almost died.

01:01:06.811 --> 01:01:08.854
Of course I know.

01:01:09.229 --> 01:01:11.982
He's the epitome of democracy.

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:17.544
And he's all too kind.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:24.201
He forgave all the remnants
of the dictatorship.

01:01:24.468 --> 01:01:26.554
Amazing.

01:01:28.004 --> 01:01:30.590
But I can't forgive them.

01:01:33.397 --> 01:01:34.730
Take it out.

01:01:34.755 --> 01:01:38.401
It's time to release the files.

01:01:38.682 --> 01:01:41.261
We were already done
with investigation

01:01:41.286 --> 01:01:44.140
we hit a small business
with gangs behind it...

01:01:44.365 --> 01:01:48.292
And ultimately related to
congressman eom hyun-ki.

01:01:48.317 --> 01:01:50.654
Conglomerate and gang
relationship revealed

01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:56.051
he got 30million krw.

01:01:56.076 --> 01:02:00.178
Report in us dollars.
People will think he got more.

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.942
Congressman eom hyun-ki
took 40k usd bribe.

01:02:04.183 --> 01:02:07.520
Why previous prosecution
failed to report?

01:02:08.368 --> 01:02:10.739
Prosecutor han's team
invest for justice

01:02:10.764 --> 01:02:12.449
eom had a temper.

01:02:12.474 --> 01:02:14.100
Demand eom to be
investigated upon arrest.

01:02:14.124 --> 01:02:15.578
He fought back hard.

01:02:15.603 --> 01:02:18.386
I'm a victim of
targeted investigation!

01:02:18.449 --> 01:02:20.161
He got desperate.

01:02:20.576 --> 01:02:23.948
Prosecutors who helped eom
finally surfaced.

01:02:24.554 --> 01:02:27.766
He used the biggest law firm...

01:02:28.108 --> 01:02:31.057
Where han's former boss...

01:02:31.082 --> 01:02:34.159
Moon hee-go works as a laywer.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.621
Saw the paper?
Kang-sik went too far.

01:02:36.646 --> 01:02:39.699
He went for senior judiciary
to crush han.

01:02:40.104 --> 01:02:42.796
Rival papers started to attack.

01:02:42.821 --> 01:02:46.408
Public opinion started
to go in eom's favor.

01:02:46.433 --> 01:02:49.352
This used to be my seat.

01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:52.788
Where's kang-sik?

01:02:57.652 --> 01:02:59.362
Yes, sir.

01:03:01.197 --> 01:03:07.871
Must be scared after a call
from the Attorney General.

01:03:09.507 --> 01:03:11.968
Hey, kang-sik!

01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:19.538
Han kang-sik!

01:03:21.707 --> 01:03:23.542
Are you insane?

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:27.557
You should be thanking me.

01:03:27.582 --> 01:03:28.166
What?

01:03:28.191 --> 01:03:30.931
We gotta live for you to live.

01:03:30.956 --> 01:03:35.624
If the prosecution is weaker
than law firms, who'd be afraid of us?

01:03:36.318 --> 01:03:38.696
We should be the scary ones!

01:03:39.712 --> 01:03:42.715
That's why law firms
hire prosecutors as lawyers...

01:03:43.007 --> 01:03:45.885
And that's how you
receive a high salary.

01:03:46.086 --> 01:03:47.796
How dare you...

01:03:48.352 --> 01:03:50.131
Does the Attorney General know?

01:03:50.156 --> 01:03:53.785
He directed this.

01:03:53.811 --> 01:03:56.479
Don't make it hard for him.

01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:01.806
Wear a cast and
rest for a month.

01:04:02.259 --> 01:04:05.691
I'll drop eom's charges
down to one year.

01:04:06.016 --> 01:04:08.477
That won't solve anything.

01:04:08.573 --> 01:04:12.451
Think eom will give up?

01:04:14.204 --> 01:04:16.414
His case will be
buried by tomorrow.

01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:20.318
In fact, han gave an order
before meeting moon.

01:04:20.781 --> 01:04:22.950
Expose cha mi-ryeon.

01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:27.903
Take pictures!

01:04:27.928 --> 01:04:32.327
We faze people's attention
by blowing something bigger.

01:04:32.352 --> 01:04:35.913
In our world, we call it a flam.

01:04:36.545 --> 01:04:38.132
Keep your eye on the red bean.

01:04:38.157 --> 01:04:39.366
Drug addicted actress

01:04:39.391 --> 01:04:45.213
but people get fazed by
the quick hands.

01:04:48.636 --> 01:04:49.720
Eom's press conference

01:04:55.235 --> 01:05:01.951
Then you forget
where the red bean is.

01:05:09.995 --> 01:05:13.749
I'll comply with the prosecution.

01:05:14.162 --> 01:05:16.707
My apologies to the people.

01:05:18.762 --> 01:05:21.932
Bury an issue with an issue.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.045
Strategics department 1

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:31.824
han proved his power to all.

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:39.619
Du-il took over
eom's redevelopment area.

01:05:41.081 --> 01:05:45.460
He secretly saved up money
and became a rising king.

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:50.780
Some money is missing, sir.

01:05:51.685 --> 01:05:53.186
Let it go.

01:05:53.797 --> 01:05:56.591
You get icing
when touching cakes.

01:06:07.817 --> 01:06:09.318
By the way...

01:06:09.909 --> 01:06:13.538
How did you know
they'd fight back?

01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:18.324
Politicians...

01:06:19.537 --> 01:06:23.625
Must revenge.

01:06:24.542 --> 01:06:28.963
It's a very complex philosophy
of politics engineering.

01:06:29.715 --> 01:06:34.763
If you don't fight back,
the organization will crumble.

01:06:38.678 --> 01:06:43.349
All this talk make me
sound like a gangster...

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:47.588
Who is untouchable.

01:06:49.769 --> 01:06:51.495
I'm so jealous.

01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:53.355
But who are those people?

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.175
Don't know.
We just follow orders.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.452
Warning: Military reserve off-limits
that girl is so hot.

01:07:00.421 --> 01:07:01.714
Tae-su.

01:07:03.045 --> 01:07:05.965
We country boys made it big.

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:12.613
While you're at it,
why not be the king?

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:14.748
What?

01:07:15.403 --> 01:07:18.698
I'll help you.
Nothing scares us.

01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:23.751
There's nothing
we can't do together.

01:07:23.932 --> 01:07:27.060
President or congressman,
just do it.

01:07:28.547 --> 01:07:29.965
Be the king.

01:07:30.986 --> 01:07:33.948
Let's rule this country!

01:07:35.993 --> 01:07:37.369
Come on!

01:07:37.925 --> 01:07:42.268
Who's more powerful than us!

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.931
Are you nuts?

01:07:43.956 --> 01:07:46.000
What are you looking at?

01:07:46.025 --> 01:07:49.571
Go ahead to clear the way!

01:07:50.824 --> 01:07:52.901
Go! Hurry!

01:07:52.926 --> 01:07:55.386
Crazy bastard.

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.557
Let's go!

01:07:57.748 --> 01:08:00.501
After tanning on
a military reserve...

01:08:00.526 --> 01:08:04.696
The police escorted us
from mokpo to Seoul.

01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:09.209
It really felt like
we were kings of the world.

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.382
Life was awesome.

01:08:11.383 --> 01:08:12.926
They have no fear.

01:08:14.803 --> 01:08:18.390
Jeon hee-sung, a new actress...

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:26.192
Park tae-su took on her case
for breach of contract.

01:08:27.482 --> 01:08:28.859
Ms. Bong hyun-hwa?

01:08:30.234 --> 01:08:32.154
I don't use that name.

01:08:33.139 --> 01:08:35.224
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:37.826
Ms. Jeon hee-sung?

01:08:40.224 --> 01:08:45.645
Your management sued you
for making a double contract.

01:08:52.299 --> 01:08:54.259
- Mr. Prosecutor?
- Yes?

01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:59.305
Mr. Prosecutor?

01:09:01.308 --> 01:09:02.309
Yes?

01:09:04.616 --> 01:09:11.372
Reporters claimed their
affair began since then.

01:09:12.096 --> 01:09:16.977
Recently, her management
company owner...

01:09:17.825 --> 01:09:21.703
Was threatened
by unidentified gangsters...

01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:28.210
And handed jeon's contract.
Park must've been involved.

01:09:28.794 --> 01:09:30.962
His father runs an illegal realty.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.002
He has ties to choi du-il
of the wild dogs.

01:09:36.218 --> 01:09:40.096
Choi covers Seoul for
Kim of the wild dogs.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:45.227
Now, he's a powerhouse here.

01:09:46.245 --> 01:09:48.706
Can country boys do all this?

01:09:48.731 --> 01:09:49.982
No.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:53.948
Does park tae-su have the power?

01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:56.793
Yang dong-chul is behind him.

01:09:56.947 --> 01:10:00.033
And behind Yang
is chief han kang-sik.

01:10:00.682 --> 01:10:05.854
Han let gangsters off the hook
and took bribes.

01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:09.375
He even has ties with the press.

01:10:09.376 --> 01:10:13.672
They're the worst
scum in prosecution history.

01:10:14.422 --> 01:10:17.593
Come on. He's your senior.

01:10:23.431 --> 01:10:27.811
If this gets out,
the innocent prosecutors...

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:34.526
Who work like crazy
on measly salaries...

01:10:34.527 --> 01:10:36.987
Will be embarrassed.

01:10:38.531 --> 01:10:42.450
Before good prosecutors quit,
let's bring han's team down.

01:10:46.789 --> 01:10:51.084
Her name is ahn hee-yeon.

01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:54.046
She's really tenacious.

01:10:54.588 --> 01:11:00.177
Previously, she knocked off
her senior for taking bribes.

01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:06.183
Disciplinary suspended him,
but she got him fired.

01:11:06.466 --> 01:11:08.594
Why am I her target?

01:11:08.854 --> 01:11:13.191
She wants to get
chief han through you.

01:11:13.816 --> 01:11:15.943
She came for a big catch.

01:11:16.544 --> 01:11:18.921
To her, han is a big fish.

01:11:19.289 --> 01:11:20.999
Crazy bitch.

01:11:23.659 --> 01:11:26.494
Be careful.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.289
Your girlfriend is an actress?

01:11:29.543 --> 01:11:31.878
She knows that too.

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:34.419
Don't meet her.

01:11:34.837 --> 01:11:38.173
It's over.
We haven't met in ages!

01:11:38.632 --> 01:11:40.300
What the hell?

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:43.042
- Haven't met who?
- Geeze!

01:11:44.972 --> 01:11:47.516
It's a friend.

01:11:48.433 --> 01:11:50.853
He says not to meet someone.

01:11:50.936 --> 01:11:53.355
Who did you say it was?
A lawyer?

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:07.077
Say thank you.

01:12:08.286 --> 01:12:10.247
- Isn't the food great?
- Yes.

01:12:23.552 --> 01:12:25.262
- Tae-su.
- Yes?

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:29.016
I hear some bad stuff these days.

01:12:31.557 --> 01:12:33.453
What do you mean?

01:12:33.478 --> 01:12:36.356
The elections are coming up.

01:12:37.315 --> 01:12:39.359
We should be careful.

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:42.059
But chief...

01:12:44.907 --> 01:12:46.825
About du-il...

01:12:47.743 --> 01:12:51.622
If you raise a dog wrong,
it'll bite you.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.819
I hear things from mokpo.

01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:58.253
Spending time with a dog
doesn't make it a human.

01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:02.257
Raise him like a dog.

01:13:02.872 --> 01:13:04.123
Get it?

01:13:04.802 --> 01:13:06.053
Yes, sir.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:22.999
But shit... I couldn't do that.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.964
Si-yeon's husband ran off
with all the money.

01:13:30.744 --> 01:13:33.622
Who deals with stuff like this?
Du-il.

01:13:34.735 --> 01:13:36.403
You bastard!

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:39.421
Please don't kill me!

01:13:41.547 --> 01:13:47.010
Dong-chul also invested in dad
and lost his money.

01:13:51.807 --> 01:13:54.326
Can't tell who's prosecutor
and who's the gangster.

01:13:54.351 --> 01:13:56.880
Stop it!

01:13:56.905 --> 01:13:59.206
That's enough!

01:13:59.231 --> 01:14:02.002
How dare you!

01:14:05.437 --> 01:14:07.565
Who says you can stop me?

01:14:07.906 --> 01:14:10.951
Think you're a friend?

01:14:11.344 --> 01:14:14.388
Think you're human? Stupid dog!

01:14:20.293 --> 01:14:22.963
Should I settle down in Seoul?

01:14:24.429 --> 01:14:25.515
What?

01:14:26.049 --> 01:14:28.844
I'm sick of driving to mokpo.

01:14:29.011 --> 01:14:30.596
I should settle down.

01:14:30.721 --> 01:14:35.058
I can't be a gofer forever.
I'm sick of it.

01:14:35.726 --> 01:14:38.270
I can do it with your help.

01:14:39.772 --> 01:14:42.107
You'll help, right?

01:14:43.316 --> 01:14:47.445
This isn't just about a gangster
ousting his boss.

01:14:48.321 --> 01:14:53.035
Bringing down Kim
meant the same for han.

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:04.337
I should've stopped him...

01:15:14.765 --> 01:15:16.016
This is your desk?

01:15:16.433 --> 01:15:18.268
- Sang-hee.
- Put them here.

01:15:18.602 --> 01:15:19.269
What's this?

01:15:19.495 --> 01:15:21.413
- Your stuff.
- What?

01:15:21.736 --> 01:15:23.195
Your belongings.

01:15:24.304 --> 01:15:27.057
You're dating jeon hee-sung?

01:15:28.028 --> 01:15:29.530
Jeon hee-sung?

01:15:36.078 --> 01:15:38.914
He told me to take her case.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:42.501
Right, sang-hee.

01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:46.046
I put him on her case.

01:15:46.246 --> 01:15:50.417
He also told you to kiss her?

01:15:51.134 --> 01:15:53.466
And have sex with her?

01:15:58.767 --> 01:15:59.768
Sang-hee...

01:15:59.852 --> 01:16:02.521
You know I only love you.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:12.006
The rest is on a truck outside.
Go move it.

01:16:12.877 --> 01:16:14.629
You'll get a ticket.

01:16:17.244 --> 01:16:21.373
How can you have an affair
on your measly salary?

01:16:21.473 --> 01:16:24.602
How can you say that
when I got kicked out?

01:16:24.627 --> 01:16:29.506
So what?
You should've known better.

01:16:29.507 --> 01:16:33.677
You cheated on mom!
You can't say that.

01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:40.933
I should've stopped du-il,
but I couldn't.

01:16:40.934 --> 01:16:43.687
I needed money.

01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:48.108
Du-il expanded his turf.

01:16:49.527 --> 01:16:52.029
He couldn't be stopped.

01:16:54.607 --> 01:17:00.320
Trying to be the king,
he stopped sending money.

01:17:01.413 --> 01:17:04.166
It's half empty now, sir.

01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:09.296
But the scary thing was,
they stayed low.

01:17:09.337 --> 01:17:13.425
Probably because of
the upcoming elections.

01:17:14.092 --> 01:17:16.468
If elected, he'll destroy us!

01:17:16.469 --> 01:17:18.764
A former lawyer who aimed
to reform the prosecution.

01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:22.267
No one wanted
roh moo-hyun to win.

01:17:22.284 --> 01:17:26.496
If the prosecution was fair
and neutral...

01:17:26.522 --> 01:17:28.607
We won't need
an independent counsel.

01:17:29.608 --> 01:17:33.571
When Kim killed people...

01:17:33.696 --> 01:17:38.283
He poured appetite enhancers
and threw them to dogs.

01:17:40.619 --> 01:17:43.872
Show us another miracle?

01:17:43.914 --> 01:17:48.836
It was so painful
they'd beg to be killed.

01:17:50.295 --> 01:17:51.630
Shit.

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:54.842
They begged for death, not life.

01:18:10.785 --> 01:18:15.039
Chief han? What brings you here?

01:18:16.838 --> 01:18:22.254
Seeing how you came to us...

01:18:22.716 --> 01:18:25.163
You expect the ruling party
to change?

01:18:25.356 --> 01:18:28.526
- I don't think it will.
- What?

01:18:29.918 --> 01:18:33.046
You have time to relax like this?

01:18:33.646 --> 01:18:35.272
Giggling?

01:18:36.759 --> 01:18:41.805
This will destroy the opposition.

01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:46.976
But seeing you like this,
maybe it's not worth my time.

01:18:50.657 --> 01:18:52.701
We'll work hard, chief.

01:18:53.207 --> 01:18:54.668
Use it well.

01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:58.531
Calmly and slowly. Be smart.

01:18:59.322 --> 01:19:00.448
Of course.

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:22.805
I'll help you!

01:19:22.846 --> 01:19:25.265
I'll help you!

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.812
Get up!

01:19:31.564 --> 01:19:36.443
No roh! No roh!

01:19:36.652 --> 01:19:42.407
This time, we held a ritual
to ask for roh to lose.

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:54.127
During the calm before the storm,
du-il took over most gangs in Seoul.

01:19:55.212 --> 01:20:00.007
No one touched him.
They all left him alone.

01:20:00.008 --> 01:20:02.427
Presidential election: Tally of ballots

01:20:08.058 --> 01:20:10.102
- Bro?
- Huh?

01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:12.938
- I gotta go.
- What?

01:20:13.188 --> 01:20:16.149
The divorce papers came.
I gotta meet sang-hee.

01:20:16.571 --> 01:20:19.323
- Now?
- Cover for me.

01:20:22.823 --> 01:20:26.952
I can explain everything.
Meet me please?

01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:29.121
I'm almost at the station.

01:20:29.204 --> 01:20:31.039
I'll wait in the lobby.

01:20:32.082 --> 01:20:33.501
Please meet me.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:34.996
Please?

01:20:52.665 --> 01:20:53.833
Honey!

01:20:54.262 --> 01:20:56.211
Honey!

01:20:56.314 --> 01:20:57.691
Baby!

01:20:57.858 --> 01:21:02.154
Why didn't you call?
I missed you!

01:21:02.914 --> 01:21:04.958
You knew I had a show?

01:21:07.117 --> 01:21:09.745
You're amazing.

01:21:11.622 --> 01:21:13.727
- Who's she?
- Wait!

01:21:13.752 --> 01:21:17.130
- Sang-hee!
- Honey! Wait!

01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:20.255
Who is she?

01:21:22.465 --> 01:21:23.551
Honey?

01:21:24.293 --> 01:21:26.361
President roh moo-hyun elected

01:21:26.386 --> 01:21:28.847
I was so screwed.

01:21:29.723 --> 01:21:32.350
He didn't even go to college!

01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:35.228
A trades high school grad?

01:21:35.495 --> 01:21:38.498
How can he become a president?

01:21:38.609 --> 01:21:42.530
This is Korea!
How can this happen!

01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:45.113
A petty fool like him?

01:21:45.381 --> 01:21:47.299
Arrest that shaman now!

01:21:47.864 --> 01:21:51.242
After all that money he took!

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:03.285
Wait!

01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:06.259
Thank you.

01:22:11.451 --> 01:22:13.120
Hi.

01:22:14.394 --> 01:22:16.271
I'm ahn hee-yeon.

01:22:19.311 --> 01:22:21.814
Class of '80.

01:22:25.452 --> 01:22:29.665
- Did you see the paper?
- Pardon?

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:32.878
- Today's paper.
- No.

01:22:33.743 --> 01:22:35.494
It's interesting.

01:22:36.203 --> 01:22:39.165
Would you like to see? I'm done.

01:22:43.278 --> 01:22:44.738
See you again.

01:22:45.572 --> 01:22:47.533
Crazy bitch!

01:22:50.638 --> 01:22:52.014
Did you see the paper?

01:22:53.265 --> 01:22:54.265
What?

01:22:54.432 --> 01:22:56.018
Newspaper!

01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:01.128
Gangster choi claims close ties to
prosecution - is he tied to chief han?

01:23:01.152 --> 01:23:05.574
Is du-il out of his mind?

01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:09.740
Chief han can't have this now!

01:23:13.469 --> 01:23:17.865
Han lost his chance
to be a director.

01:23:19.222 --> 01:23:23.936
Someone with such allegations
cannot be a director.

01:23:25.807 --> 01:23:29.102
No one beat me like this
since high school.

01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:33.761
I warned you about du-il!

01:23:37.726 --> 01:23:39.972
I told you to stay out!

01:23:39.997 --> 01:23:42.416
I wasn't trying to stop you.

01:23:43.802 --> 01:23:48.682
Sir! I didn't mean to stop you!

01:23:49.112 --> 01:23:51.739
Du-il's tae-su's friend!

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.201
Hit tae-su, sir!

01:24:01.418 --> 01:24:04.226
Fool. Why at a time like this?

01:24:04.336 --> 01:24:08.841
Let's make him stay put.

01:24:08.965 --> 01:24:10.842
What do you mean?

01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:14.282
What do you think?

01:24:18.183 --> 01:24:19.810
Throw him in prison?

01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:24.147
He did all kinds of shit for me.

01:24:25.103 --> 01:24:28.151
He acted up a bit, but prison?

01:24:28.237 --> 01:24:31.282
I think it's for the best.

01:24:32.251 --> 01:24:37.339
If we don't, du-il could die.

01:24:38.203 --> 01:24:41.582
Eung-su wants him dead.

01:24:41.874 --> 01:24:45.711
It's hard to tell cops
from gangsters at a glance.

01:24:46.401 --> 01:24:51.698
If they're the wild dogs, he's dead.
If they're cops, he'll live.

01:24:56.972 --> 01:24:58.473
So damn fast!

01:24:58.803 --> 01:24:59.512
Choi du-il!

01:24:59.537 --> 01:25:03.165
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:25:04.436 --> 01:25:07.148
Shit! Why didn't you tell me!

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.644
I ran like hell!

01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:14.573
Han started to rebuild
his kingdom again.

01:25:25.184 --> 01:25:28.892
Since he handed over the file
on roh's weakness...

01:25:29.129 --> 01:25:34.801
Han would be the first target
when the ruling party finds out.

01:25:34.802 --> 01:25:35.886
I need the boys.

01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:40.390
Before words get out,
han had to strike first.

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:45.353
Enough already!

01:25:58.402 --> 01:26:02.948
He's the trustee who managed
Hong's slush fund.

01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:09.416
When eung-su's men couldn't do it,
han got the confession himself.

01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:14.049
Then he used it to charge
Hong with breach of duty.

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:19.587
I warned you.

01:26:19.612 --> 01:26:21.322
Like paying a tribute to a king...

01:26:21.557 --> 01:26:25.561
He removed a Thorn
for the ruling party.

01:26:26.311 --> 01:26:31.108
Then old directors got cut,
and han set eyes on their seats.

01:26:34.236 --> 01:26:38.781
After the job was done,
I got appointed down south.

01:26:38.782 --> 01:26:39.949
Don't pack that.

01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:44.415
Han suggested to stay low
till things quieted down.

01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:47.190
- Just pack lightly.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:47.708 --> 01:26:49.627
We'll be back soon.

01:26:52.991 --> 01:26:53.992
Impeachment possibility

01:26:54.017 --> 01:26:59.595
1 year since he took office,
roh faced impeachment crisis.

01:26:59.711 --> 01:27:01.213
Reasons for impeachment:
Corruption and breach of law

01:27:01.237 --> 01:27:06.826
president roh who is
facing impeachment crisis...

01:27:06.851 --> 01:27:09.270
Will make a statement soon.

01:27:10.022 --> 01:27:11.857
Approve, disapprove

01:27:13.584 --> 01:27:15.210
disapproval rally

01:27:15.235 --> 01:27:17.905
roh's supporters
veto impeachment

01:27:18.572 --> 01:27:21.033
how much longer
do I have to stay?

01:27:21.449 --> 01:27:23.242
Just a bit more.

01:27:23.243 --> 01:27:27.414
Chief is on it.
You'll be back soon.

01:27:27.481 --> 01:27:30.624
You know how crazy it is
these days!

01:27:32.002 --> 01:27:36.799
But I can't stand it here
any longer!

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:42.794
Chairman of national assembly enters

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:56.205
The wild dogs took over du-il's turf
while he was imprisoned.

01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:05.410
I didn't call because I'm drunk.

01:28:05.923 --> 01:28:09.218
Sang-hee, happy birthday.

01:28:09.243 --> 01:28:11.621
I love you.

01:28:22.553 --> 01:28:26.014
Impeachment motion approved

01:28:35.395 --> 01:28:37.981
Not destroyed by fire...

01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:42.698
It grows again in the spring.

01:28:44.324 --> 01:28:48.036
'Burnt but never destroyed.'

01:29:05.435 --> 01:29:10.399
Nice to have a prosecutor friend.
I can smoke in here.

01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:15.331
Tae-su.

01:29:15.856 --> 01:29:18.275
You're the only one I trust.

01:29:19.711 --> 01:29:23.172
My boys will get hurt,
if I'm in here.

01:29:24.087 --> 01:29:26.757
They should live.

01:29:27.367 --> 01:29:28.786
Listen.

01:29:31.210 --> 01:29:33.838
I'll catch whoever
did this to me.

01:29:34.134 --> 01:29:35.761
I'll find them...

01:29:38.057 --> 01:29:40.309
And kill them all.

01:29:43.216 --> 01:29:47.888
He knew very well
his life was in danger.

01:29:49.173 --> 01:29:53.468
His kingdom collapsed
in a flash.

01:29:56.365 --> 01:30:00.709
He told me to give his men
his secret stash.

01:30:00.734 --> 01:30:04.822
But I didn't give it to them.

01:30:07.362 --> 01:30:10.699
That money was for mokpo.

01:30:10.994 --> 01:30:15.999
Returning it was the only way
to keep them alive.

01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:32.740
I'm prosecutor park's colleague.
I came to see him.

01:30:37.009 --> 01:30:40.530
You're still sleeping?

01:30:40.555 --> 01:30:43.016
Shouldn't you be at work?

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:47.364
I heard you rented a cottage.

01:30:49.324 --> 01:30:51.785
It's really nice.

01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:56.749
Isn't the rent here
$5,000 a month?

01:30:58.917 --> 01:31:01.670
You're separated from your wife?

01:31:02.796 --> 01:31:05.549
Must've saved a lot of money.

01:31:08.147 --> 01:31:12.359
Drinking during work hours?

01:31:12.598 --> 01:31:16.101
Just one for my hangover.

01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:18.812
Want some?

01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:32.492
I'll just be frank.

01:31:32.847 --> 01:31:36.559
Try the Sushi. It's good.

01:31:36.664 --> 01:31:38.248
It's way better than in Seoul.

01:31:38.331 --> 01:31:40.626
Stop changing subjects.

01:31:41.504 --> 01:31:43.547
I'm your senior.

01:31:51.232 --> 01:31:52.980
Oh, I did?

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.726
I'm sorry.

01:31:58.894 --> 01:32:03.148
Is it over with jeon hee-sung?

01:32:03.816 --> 01:32:06.860
Yes. I've been here for months.

01:32:08.153 --> 01:32:11.156
It's long over with her.

01:32:11.406 --> 01:32:16.369
Her management company
owner filed a suit...

01:32:16.954 --> 01:32:22.250
Against choi du-il.
You know him, right?

01:32:24.753 --> 01:32:25.963
Choi du-il?

01:32:26.421 --> 01:32:27.923
She knows everything.

01:32:28.423 --> 01:32:30.634
She must have
all our connections.

01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:38.183
She knows the rent here
is paid with du-il's money.

01:32:38.266 --> 01:32:42.395
But instead of getting me,
she came here for han kang-sik.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:45.379
She wants to get to him
through me.

01:32:45.624 --> 01:32:47.125
I'm nothing.

01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:51.446
She came to see
if I'd betray han.

01:32:52.447 --> 01:32:55.618
I can't show my cards.

01:32:55.868 --> 01:32:58.245
I can't be an easy target.

01:32:58.828 --> 01:33:04.125
I'm too young to get killed by han
or start a legal service.

01:33:06.378 --> 01:33:09.507
I'm hot. Why's it so hot?

01:33:12.943 --> 01:33:14.402
Get dressed.

01:33:14.427 --> 01:33:15.804
Aren't you hot?

01:33:16.411 --> 01:33:19.122
You look hot. Is it just me?

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.102
Such a hot day.

01:33:26.356 --> 01:33:27.858
I'll go.

01:33:28.121 --> 01:33:31.249
Why? Don't you wanna chat more?

01:33:31.654 --> 01:33:34.907
I have lots of time today.

01:33:35.821 --> 01:33:39.199
I just feel so hot.

01:33:40.203 --> 01:33:41.789
Don't like it?

01:33:42.247 --> 01:33:46.293
This is as big as it gets!

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.155
Shit! It's cold!

01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:57.930
I had to look like
an unpredictable lunatic.

01:33:58.096 --> 01:34:04.186
If I look scared,
she'll attack and bind me to han.

01:34:05.103 --> 01:34:07.981
I need help.

01:34:17.936 --> 01:34:19.021
Bro!

01:34:23.622 --> 01:34:24.622
What brings you to Seoul?

01:34:24.848 --> 01:34:28.101
I called you a dozen times.

01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:29.712
Well...

01:34:29.962 --> 01:34:32.923
Ahn hee-yeon from
inspections came down.

01:34:33.702 --> 01:34:35.704
She knows everything.

01:34:36.591 --> 01:34:40.011
- I got her to back off but...
- Wait.

01:34:40.584 --> 01:34:42.503
Let's talk over there.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:43.851
Come on.

01:34:49.807 --> 01:34:52.392
You son of a bitch!

01:34:53.819 --> 01:34:54.819
What?

01:34:55.153 --> 01:34:57.030
Shit! Don't you get it?

01:34:58.115 --> 01:34:59.825
How old are you?

01:35:01.577 --> 01:35:03.579
What do you mean?

01:35:03.789 --> 01:35:08.544
If you got kicked out,
you should know to quit.

01:35:09.001 --> 01:35:11.837
Or stay quiet and low!

01:35:12.295 --> 01:35:17.467
But you keep calling
and come up to annoy us like this?

01:35:19.969 --> 01:35:24.348
What if inspections come at us
through you?

01:35:24.751 --> 01:35:25.835
Shit!

01:35:28.436 --> 01:35:30.147
Just stay low.

01:35:31.106 --> 01:35:32.525
Dead quiet.

01:35:33.593 --> 01:35:35.887
Got that, bastard?

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:54.250
Du-il got released earlier
as an exemplary prisoner.

01:35:55.088 --> 01:35:58.509
I wanted to see him,
but couldn't.

01:35:59.301 --> 01:36:02.845
There's nothing I could do.

01:36:02.846 --> 01:36:05.015
President roh in
a lame duck session

01:36:11.188 --> 01:36:12.648
Shit.

01:36:22.435 --> 01:36:27.065
The wild dogs rule now...

01:36:29.623 --> 01:36:32.084
And tae-su took all your money.

01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:34.837
You've been screwed, boss.

01:36:35.232 --> 01:36:37.943
Let's get revenge, boss!

01:36:38.474 --> 01:36:40.435
Round up the boys.

01:36:48.577 --> 01:36:53.331
Prosecutor park,
let's call it a night.

01:36:53.732 --> 01:36:56.043
Just one more drink!

01:36:56.501 --> 01:37:00.437
Let's pop him, sir.
No one will know.

01:37:03.574 --> 01:37:05.784
- Hello?
- Tae-su.

01:37:06.141 --> 01:37:07.392
Who's this?

01:37:07.812 --> 01:37:09.564
It's du-il.

01:37:10.217 --> 01:37:14.582
Du-il! Choi du-il!

01:37:16.003 --> 01:37:17.880
Long time no see!

01:37:18.338 --> 01:37:20.090
Didn't you know I got out?

01:37:21.258 --> 01:37:27.305
I forgot. Sorry, I couldn't go.

01:37:28.223 --> 01:37:30.559
My safe was empty.

01:37:31.727 --> 01:37:35.731
I used it all.

01:37:36.314 --> 01:37:38.233
2 years is a long time.

01:37:38.817 --> 01:37:40.903
That's everything I had.

01:37:42.237 --> 01:37:43.947
Of course.

01:37:46.742 --> 01:37:51.454
Tae-su... did you do this to me?

01:37:52.247 --> 01:37:56.126
Does it matter now, du-il?

01:37:57.419 --> 01:37:58.461
Who cares?

01:37:58.546 --> 01:38:01.381
- You bastard!
- What, you asshole!

01:38:01.632 --> 01:38:04.259
Snap to it, pal!

01:38:05.343 --> 01:38:08.430
We're through, stupid!

01:38:09.056 --> 01:38:13.894
Who cares who did this to you!

01:38:14.905 --> 01:38:20.326
What? You'll revenge?

01:38:21.527 --> 01:38:24.697
Fine! I did it!

01:38:25.864 --> 01:38:28.951
I did it, you bastard!

01:38:29.618 --> 01:38:31.537
Son of a bitch.

01:38:34.998 --> 01:38:41.547
It's over for us, stupid!

01:38:44.299 --> 01:38:47.469
It's all over, fool!

01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:51.139
It's over, bastard!

01:39:23.922 --> 01:39:27.676
Look at you. Had it rough?

01:39:30.095 --> 01:39:32.055
But how...

01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:34.224
We came to see you.

01:39:34.607 --> 01:39:39.862
While having drinks,
he wanted to see you.

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:42.767
We came to drink with you.

01:39:43.233 --> 01:39:44.610
Chief...

01:39:45.235 --> 01:39:49.489
I told you to wait just a bit.

01:39:50.115 --> 01:39:51.784
Get in, tae-su.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:54.452
Let's go drink.

01:39:54.703 --> 01:39:56.830
Let's party.

01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:02.645
Yes.

01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:04.212
Boss! No!

01:40:04.296 --> 01:40:05.422
Move!

01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:06.799
Sir!

01:40:07.049 --> 01:40:09.718
Boss! No!

01:40:11.094 --> 01:40:12.304
Sir!

01:40:19.853 --> 01:40:20.603
Visit andong

01:40:20.628 --> 01:40:24.291
you know the smiling
hahoe masks of andong?

01:40:24.316 --> 01:40:26.026
Know why it's smiling?

01:40:26.502 --> 01:40:28.796
Let's smile? Be happy?

01:40:28.821 --> 01:40:30.864
What's andong famous for?

01:40:30.945 --> 01:40:32.780
Hemp cloth?

01:40:33.158 --> 01:40:37.580
Hemp is made out of
marijuana, you know?

01:40:38.389 --> 01:40:39.557
Think about it.

01:40:39.807 --> 01:40:43.894
The whole town is filled with
marijuana fields.

01:40:44.082 --> 01:40:46.960
Farmers would gather
to smoke it.

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:51.437
That's why the
hahoe mask is smiling.

01:40:53.115 --> 01:40:54.914
Get high?

01:40:58.042 --> 01:40:59.827
Shouldn't we go, sir?

01:40:59.852 --> 01:41:03.496
Let's go sniff it too.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.351
Why not?

01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:08.661
- Be like the masks?
- Hahoe masks!

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.197
Let's go!

01:41:12.222 --> 01:41:14.099
I'll make a u-turn!

01:41:55.574 --> 01:41:57.660
I came to in a hospital.

01:41:59.036 --> 01:42:02.497
If it was a head-on collision,
we'd be dead.

01:42:03.578 --> 01:42:08.040
Because we got hit on to the side
and spun around...

01:42:08.128 --> 01:42:11.214
We could all survive.

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:16.929
They came happy to see me.

01:42:17.345 --> 01:42:22.142
But when they left without a word
for another hospital...

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:27.690
I thought it was odd,
but I didn't know.

01:42:28.607 --> 01:42:31.068
6 months after
du-il's disappearance...

01:42:31.610 --> 01:42:36.865
I met one of his men
on an arrest and heard the truth.

01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:39.910
You bastard!

01:42:40.661 --> 01:42:43.163
If it wasn't for my boss,
you'd be long dead!

01:42:44.519 --> 01:42:45.269
What?

01:42:45.294 --> 01:42:47.380
That car accident!

01:42:48.001 --> 01:42:50.378
Han was about to kill you!

01:42:50.504 --> 01:42:54.799
He was taking you to eung-su
to kill you!

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:57.094
Boss knew and saved you.

01:42:58.470 --> 01:43:04.142
He hit the car to save you
from getting killed!

01:43:04.309 --> 01:43:05.393
Boss!

01:43:05.477 --> 01:43:08.438
He stole everything from us!

01:43:08.647 --> 01:43:11.734
He got screwed over too.

01:43:12.818 --> 01:43:14.778
I have to protect him!

01:43:15.988 --> 01:43:17.823
I promised!

01:43:22.410 --> 01:43:28.542
Du-il became their
target for saving me.

01:43:30.127 --> 01:43:33.964
After several months
on the run...

01:43:35.423 --> 01:43:37.967
He got tired of running.

01:43:37.968 --> 01:43:43.849
They say he bought a nice suit
and went to eung-su.

01:44:34.066 --> 01:44:35.818
Fool...

01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:50.583
Eat him down to the bones.

01:45:45.137 --> 01:45:50.976
That's how I lost my good friend.

01:46:13.999 --> 01:46:16.752
President Lee myung-bak elected

01:46:21.674 --> 01:46:25.217
tae-su! Open the door!

01:46:25.218 --> 01:46:26.303
It's unlocked.

01:46:30.223 --> 01:46:30.891
Tae-su!

01:46:31.203 --> 01:46:33.455
Wake up!

01:46:33.898 --> 01:46:36.901
Dad got arrested!

01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:40.317
Cops suddenly took him!

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.029
They barged in
and took him away!

01:46:44.822 --> 01:46:47.073
How can this happen?

01:46:47.074 --> 01:46:48.366
Hi, tae-su.

01:46:48.617 --> 01:46:50.368
You got my dad arrested?

01:46:51.075 --> 01:46:54.912
Well, that bitch is tenacious.

01:46:55.833 --> 01:46:57.793
She keeps coming at us.

01:46:57.835 --> 01:47:01.547
The higher ups are bothered
by our ties to you.

01:47:02.255 --> 01:47:03.255
So?

01:47:03.712 --> 01:47:07.257
What do you think? It's simple.

01:47:08.011 --> 01:47:13.601
Just quit, then we'll stop.

01:47:14.184 --> 01:47:16.144
We'll release him.

01:47:16.979 --> 01:47:18.396
How can you do this?

01:47:18.731 --> 01:47:23.569
Come on. We did it all the time.

01:47:24.695 --> 01:47:28.741
Remember? It's what we did.

01:47:31.201 --> 01:47:32.494
Isn't it?

01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:53.348
Tae-su!

01:47:54.099 --> 01:47:56.143
No! Tae-su!

01:47:56.476 --> 01:47:58.687
A thought crossed my mind.

01:47:59.271 --> 01:48:00.648
What if...

01:48:00.731 --> 01:48:02.900
- I'll lock him up.
- What?

01:48:02.983 --> 01:48:03.609
Book him!

01:48:03.692 --> 01:48:06.570
I arrested that gym teacher?

01:48:06.654 --> 01:48:10.490
What if I helped that poor girl?

01:48:13.413 --> 01:48:21.413
If I didn't fall to their temptations
and lived like the 99% of prosecutors?

01:48:32.387 --> 01:48:34.222
Let's party.

01:48:44.357 --> 01:48:46.527
I did it, you bastard!

01:48:47.986 --> 01:48:51.239
What if inspections
come at us through you?

01:48:51.489 --> 01:48:52.825
Shit!

01:49:09.717 --> 01:49:12.302
Raise him like a dog.

01:49:19.392 --> 01:49:23.188
Forget pride.
Just stand next to the power.

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.943
Just go with the flow of history.

01:49:30.112 --> 01:49:33.073
No good came to those
without power.

01:49:41.456 --> 01:49:45.544
Suddenly, everything
seemed meaningless.

01:50:08.441 --> 01:50:11.486
Tae-su! Wake up!

01:50:11.779 --> 01:50:13.906
Can you hear me?

01:50:14.156 --> 01:50:15.658
Say something!

01:50:16.742 --> 01:50:20.788
Former president roh moo-hyun
has passed away.

01:50:21.079 --> 01:50:28.629
He jumped off a cliff at 6:40 am
and committed a suicide.

01:50:33.258 --> 01:50:35.385
Wake up!

01:50:35.719 --> 01:50:37.971
Politicians...

01:50:38.055 --> 01:50:42.225
Must revenge.

01:50:42.976 --> 01:50:46.814
It's a very complex philosophy
of politics engineering.

01:50:47.292 --> 01:50:48.561
Will states 'too painful'

01:50:48.586 --> 01:50:55.467
to protect what's yours,
you must revenge.

01:50:57.199 --> 01:51:02.704
President roh left a short will
on his computer.

01:51:02.705 --> 01:51:10.170
It states his heartaches
and apologies to loved ones.

01:51:16.051 --> 01:51:18.428
It was painful don't resent me

01:51:35.403 --> 01:51:39.491
God forgive us.

01:51:51.629 --> 01:51:55.007
Director han! Congratulations!

01:51:55.056 --> 01:52:01.938
Han got promoted to a director
and Yang became a chief.

01:52:05.183 --> 01:52:06.852
As soon as I quit...

01:52:06.894 --> 01:52:10.397
They dropped charges
and released dad.

01:52:10.877 --> 01:52:12.941
But that wasn't the end.

01:52:13.901 --> 01:52:15.861
Everything I owned got seized.

01:52:17.268 --> 01:52:21.940
They weren't satisfied with
just me quitting.

01:52:23.285 --> 01:52:26.329
Han has no mercy.

01:52:28.791 --> 01:52:30.918
I had lost everything.

01:52:31.376 --> 01:52:32.711
My youth.

01:52:33.962 --> 01:52:35.422
My family.

01:52:36.048 --> 01:52:37.675
And...

01:52:40.719 --> 01:52:42.345
My friend.

01:52:55.150 --> 01:52:57.110
I had to do something.

01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:04.326
I took all I had and
got the same suit like du-il.

01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:09.039
I bought a car.

01:53:09.877 --> 01:53:12.524
And set up a ritzy office
in Seoul.

01:53:17.756 --> 01:53:21.885
I've bet my everything.

01:53:32.395 --> 01:53:33.772
Here.

01:53:36.942 --> 01:53:40.863
Came to make fun of me
getting demoted?

01:53:43.073 --> 01:53:44.157
No.

01:53:44.366 --> 01:53:46.994
I came to catch han kang-sik.

01:53:47.911 --> 01:53:52.583
Are you really that naive?

01:53:54.752 --> 01:53:56.472
Should've come
when you were a prosecutor...

01:53:58.130 --> 01:53:59.632
When I was in Seoul...

01:54:00.591 --> 01:54:03.552
Before han became a director.

01:54:04.177 --> 01:54:06.096
But we can't now.

01:54:06.889 --> 01:54:11.894
He's no longer someone
you and I can bring down.

01:54:14.522 --> 01:54:16.023
Right.

01:54:16.398 --> 01:54:18.609
So we should up the ante.

01:54:31.046 --> 01:54:37.928
My father-in-law agreed to help
and suggested some good people.

01:54:38.211 --> 01:54:42.465
I had one important step left.

01:54:45.427 --> 01:54:47.262
Sang-hee.

01:54:50.808 --> 01:54:52.643
Dinner time, right?

01:54:54.562 --> 01:54:57.397
I'll buy. Let's go eat.

01:55:02.110 --> 01:55:04.154
What do you want?

01:55:08.033 --> 01:55:09.702
Things must be hard.

01:55:10.786 --> 01:55:12.663
I'm starting over.

01:55:12.871 --> 01:55:14.206
With what?

01:55:15.457 --> 01:55:17.459
You quit being a prosecutor.

01:55:18.502 --> 01:55:21.379
You won't make much as a lawyer.

01:55:23.215 --> 01:55:24.675
I'm going bigger.

01:55:26.051 --> 01:55:27.469
I signed...

01:55:28.095 --> 01:55:29.847
The divorce agreement.

01:55:37.521 --> 01:55:38.814
Hold on to it.

01:55:38.939 --> 01:55:43.652
Decide what to do with it
once the job is done.

01:55:44.152 --> 01:55:45.487
What job?

01:55:45.696 --> 01:55:47.364
I'm sure you'll like it.

01:55:51.785 --> 01:55:52.995
Still got it.

01:55:55.497 --> 01:55:56.999
The mischievious eyes.

01:56:00.418 --> 01:56:06.341
If I said I loved her
and begged her to take me back...

01:56:06.967 --> 01:56:11.429
She said she would've just left.

01:56:12.139 --> 01:56:14.391
Because emotional investments
always fail.

01:56:15.643 --> 01:56:18.604
This is my son-in-law
and daughter.

01:56:19.563 --> 01:56:20.856
Hello.

01:56:21.815 --> 01:56:25.360
I met a key figure
of the opposition party.

01:56:25.402 --> 01:56:27.946
He's our specialist,
chief Kim min-jae.

01:56:28.446 --> 01:56:31.867
He made top commercials
for over 20 years.

01:56:32.346 --> 01:56:34.411
He's a genius at making
the right image.

01:56:35.829 --> 01:56:38.498
Why are you in politics?

01:56:39.041 --> 01:56:40.208
Pardon?

01:56:40.458 --> 01:56:45.756
You want to expose corruption
and change the world?

01:56:47.465 --> 01:56:50.761
But politics can't change it.

01:56:51.804 --> 01:56:56.099
I don't plan to change the world
with politics.

01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:59.019
Then?

01:57:01.229 --> 01:57:05.693
I want to catch someone with it.

01:57:11.782 --> 01:57:14.159
Tell me your story.

01:57:14.993 --> 01:57:17.454
Then I'll draw out your image.

01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:25.253
I'll decide what to put in
and to take out.

01:57:26.714 --> 01:57:28.215
It was awkward.

01:57:29.341 --> 01:57:34.888
Like confessing to a priest,
I started telling my story.

01:57:35.347 --> 01:57:39.309
My dad was a crook.

01:57:41.353 --> 01:57:44.772
When color tvs were rare...

01:57:44.773 --> 01:57:45.899
It's funny.

01:57:46.024 --> 01:57:49.111
But I had good qualifications to run.

01:57:49.653 --> 01:57:53.031
A strategics prosecutor
born in mokpo...

01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.714
Who protested for democracy.

01:57:54.723 --> 01:57:55.802
Former prosecutor park
press conference

01:57:55.826 --> 01:57:57.828
I was involved in few corruption.

01:57:58.036 --> 01:58:03.083
But they were cards
to get rid of han and Yang.

01:58:03.501 --> 01:58:05.002
That's right.

01:58:05.210 --> 01:58:08.255
I chose politics.

01:58:11.509 --> 01:58:12.593
Hello, judge Kim.

01:58:14.469 --> 01:58:15.638
Director?

01:58:16.648 --> 01:58:17.890
The TV...

01:58:20.058 --> 01:58:22.811
Why did you quit the prosecution?

01:58:22.936 --> 01:58:25.856
Why are giving
a declaration of conscience?

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:27.774
Did the opposition party
put you to this?

01:58:27.775 --> 01:58:30.152
You're running for their party?

01:58:30.277 --> 01:58:32.945
Why are you running for congress?

01:58:32.946 --> 01:58:38.201
Former prosecutor park tae-su
is holding a press conference.

01:58:38.827 --> 01:58:43.541
He claims to expose
director han kang-sik's corruption.

01:58:43.582 --> 01:58:45.793
Let's connect to the scene.

01:58:46.502 --> 01:58:50.255
I'll sacrifice what I must
for justice.

01:58:51.131 --> 01:58:56.011
I leaked han's ties
to the wild dogs.

01:58:56.845 --> 01:58:59.222
My party attacked full on.

01:58:59.306 --> 01:59:02.475
It was all over the press.

01:59:03.143 --> 01:59:04.143
Oops.

01:59:05.145 --> 01:59:09.942
I forgot I had
a lunch appointment.

01:59:11.151 --> 01:59:12.570
Sorry.

01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:20.994
After the press conference,
I got a call from a familiar number.

01:59:27.835 --> 01:59:30.504
It's our first time
eating like this, right?

01:59:33.298 --> 01:59:34.758
I guess.

01:59:35.759 --> 01:59:37.845
We should've done this more.

01:59:39.054 --> 01:59:40.472
But you know life.

01:59:43.058 --> 01:59:44.518
How's your wife?

01:59:46.103 --> 01:59:47.103
Fine.

01:59:58.699 --> 02:00:02.578
Your father-in-law has
a lot of dirt on him.

02:00:03.871 --> 02:00:08.709
He did some bad things
to run his business.

02:00:10.043 --> 02:00:11.587
He'll get 5 years.

02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:14.840
It's not good for your kids.

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:18.886
Kids with grandfathers
are better mannered.

02:00:19.261 --> 02:00:21.639
Your wife is in Canada
with your kids.

02:00:22.305 --> 02:00:24.850
You smuggled out a lot of money.

02:00:25.518 --> 02:00:30.731
The wild dogs' money
is there in your wife's name?

02:00:31.607 --> 02:00:36.820
Kids who grow up without mothers
are more ill-mannered.

02:00:42.034 --> 02:00:43.326
Tae-su.

02:00:45.621 --> 02:00:48.123
This world...

02:00:49.332 --> 02:00:52.044
Doesn't run logically.

02:00:54.087 --> 02:00:59.134
Lots of crazy things
happen in our world.

02:01:00.719 --> 02:01:04.056
So you have to be cautious.

02:01:05.223 --> 02:01:10.604
Like how du-il vanished?

02:01:34.545 --> 02:01:36.088
Tae-su...

02:01:37.172 --> 02:01:38.882
Can't you see?

02:01:41.426 --> 02:01:45.388
I'm the living history.
This country means me.

02:01:49.351 --> 02:01:51.687
Think you can win?

02:01:52.688 --> 02:01:53.981
No.

02:01:55.357 --> 02:01:56.734
But I should try.

02:01:57.150 --> 02:02:00.278
You taught me
that revenge is a must.

02:02:01.029 --> 02:02:04.742
That's the philosophy of
politics engineering.

02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:07.953
Chief...

02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:11.289
No, director...

02:02:12.958 --> 02:02:14.502
You said it.

02:02:19.673 --> 02:02:20.674
All set.

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:22.968
The reporters are coming here.

02:02:23.051 --> 02:02:26.221
Let's start 5 minutes earlier
than them.

02:02:27.014 --> 02:02:30.225
We have them outnumbered.

02:02:30.433 --> 02:02:33.687
Everything's ready, sir.
Don't worry.

02:02:36.106 --> 02:02:37.858
Just remember a few key tags.

02:02:37.941 --> 02:02:41.153
A mokpo native who took part
in the pro-democracy.

02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:45.239
You were caught up in
some corruption as a prosecutor...

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:49.912
But they were ordered
by han and Yang.

02:02:50.495 --> 02:02:52.164
And lastly...

02:02:53.165 --> 02:02:55.668
Struggling under
an ex-con father...

02:02:56.126 --> 02:03:01.507
You became a prosecutor
to make a better world.

02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:05.594
I pulled the trigger at them.

02:03:15.062 --> 02:03:18.732
Han fought back
with a press conference.

02:03:19.232 --> 02:03:22.778
He said I was lying
to get attention in the elections.

02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:25.405
The slaughterhouse is a cover!

02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:28.491
He even fed people
to dogs and killed them.

02:03:30.368 --> 02:03:34.456
Knowing they'd be imprisoned,
du-il's men confessed against them.

02:03:34.665 --> 02:03:39.127
Interest in han's ties
to the wild dogs escalated.

02:03:39.252 --> 02:03:42.339
It reeks in here.

02:03:44.049 --> 02:03:48.178
You can't book us!
Where's the evidence!

02:03:49.221 --> 02:03:51.682
You son of a bitch!

02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:56.394
These are your statements,
correct?

02:03:57.479 --> 02:03:58.814
Yes.

02:04:06.154 --> 02:04:09.199
And I threw one final punch.

02:04:09.992 --> 02:04:12.745
It was strictly my idea.

02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:16.248
My press conferences was obvious.

02:04:16.915 --> 02:04:19.627
It's a predictable drama.

02:04:21.211 --> 02:04:23.005
I needed a twist.

02:04:24.865 --> 02:04:30.888
I stand here as a man of conscience
and a son of mokpo.

02:04:31.233 --> 02:04:32.569
Something heroic...

02:04:33.027 --> 02:04:35.905
I may not know politics,
but I knew that.

02:04:36.351 --> 02:04:38.896
As many suspect my sincerity...

02:04:39.938 --> 02:04:43.984
The party opposed,
but out of my free will...

02:04:44.777 --> 02:04:49.322
I refuse my nomination to run
for mokpo.

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:58.240
I ask the party to nominate me
to run in jongro, Seoul.

02:05:02.335 --> 02:05:05.005
The reporters exclaimed.

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:09.092
But it's Kim woo-hyun's
5th run for office there.

02:05:09.718 --> 02:05:11.177
It was impossible.

02:05:11.178 --> 02:05:12.720
Park's claims are false.

02:05:12.721 --> 02:05:15.222
Park tae-su is challenging
Kim woo-hyun!

02:05:15.223 --> 02:05:18.393
He dropped out of mokpo!

02:05:24.357 --> 02:05:27.945
Park held a conference
to say he'll run in jongro.

02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:36.704
The next presidential
candidate was in jongro.

02:05:36.912 --> 02:05:38.996
Running against him...

02:05:38.997 --> 02:05:43.375
Meant my motives were not just
to get elected.

02:05:43.376 --> 02:05:46.589
I won the doubting public over.

02:05:49.132 --> 02:05:52.845
Bury an issue with an issue.

02:05:53.596 --> 02:05:58.433
I beat them with their tactic.

02:06:15.618 --> 02:06:17.327
What are you doing?

02:06:23.166 --> 02:06:24.668
Are you okay?

02:06:28.005 --> 02:06:30.090
It's nice here.

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:50.402
Your banquet is over.

02:06:50.944 --> 02:06:57.910
I made the choice
for a reformation in prosecution!

02:07:06.334 --> 02:07:09.880
Despite charges of being involved
with corruption...

02:07:09.963 --> 02:07:15.427
There is growing support
for park tae-su.

02:07:15.553 --> 02:07:22.142
With 10 days to the elections,
he is in a tight race...

02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:26.564
With Kim woo-hyun
who had been expected to win.

02:07:26.647 --> 02:07:30.233
Vote park tae-su
for a stronger jongro!

02:07:32.736 --> 02:07:37.365
I was a con-artist, a crook,
and an obedient dog for power.

02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:42.788
I deceived people like that
and lived well.

02:07:44.039 --> 02:07:50.462
Most people do what they do
faithfully and sincerely.

02:07:51.463 --> 02:07:53.882
That's how the world runs.

02:07:54.205 --> 02:08:00.587
The ordinary prosecutor
worked hard and became a chief.

02:08:01.139 --> 02:08:04.017
He's a strong candidate
to be a director.

02:08:04.893 --> 02:08:09.272
Ahn became the first
female chief of prosecution.

02:08:10.708 --> 02:08:12.543
You hungry?

02:08:12.568 --> 02:08:14.570
Keep your eyes on the ball.

02:08:14.778 --> 02:08:19.282
Be alert and watch
when they try to trick you.

02:08:19.575 --> 02:08:23.286
If not, you'll lose 100%.

02:08:42.097 --> 02:08:43.724
What happened to me?

02:08:43.974 --> 02:08:45.433
Did I get elected?

02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:47.343
Did I lose?

02:08:48.145 --> 02:08:49.688
I'm curious too.

02:08:50.105 --> 02:08:53.441
Because you decide that.

02:08:54.424 --> 02:08:57.636
You are the king of the world.

02:09:04.912 --> 02:09:08.248
I know what you're thinking.

02:09:09.332 --> 02:09:11.334
You think you won?

02:09:12.210 --> 02:09:13.629
In a year...

02:09:13.754 --> 02:09:15.172
No, 6 months!

02:09:15.422 --> 02:09:17.299
When things calm down...

02:09:17.633 --> 02:09:20.052
Know what will happen?

02:09:21.679 --> 02:09:24.807
I'll make your life hell.

02:09:26.183 --> 02:09:29.477
I'll show you how scary
this world is.

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:33.774
This country is terrifying!

02:09:36.284 --> 02:09:37.953
I'll show you!

02:09:44.326 --> 02:09:45.703
Let's go.

02:09:51.333 --> 02:09:59.333
Han is suffering from depression
and panic disorder in prison.

02:10:01.885 --> 02:10:04.679
Yang got demoted to the country.

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:11.186
He was caught secretly looking up
at girls' skirts.

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.109
Any comment?

02:10:17.150 --> 02:10:23.699
As a prosecutor,
I apologize for causing a stir.

02:10:24.992 --> 02:10:28.286
And to my daughter
who is studying abroad.

02:10:29.454 --> 02:10:31.123
Daddy is sorry!
