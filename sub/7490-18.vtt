00:03.083 --> 00:04.375
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:04.709 --> 00:07.166
You kids are getting sweat
all over my mats.

00:08.125 --> 00:10.333
This is why we can't have nice things!

00:11.583 --> 00:14.250
Rudy, calm down.
Why are you getting so worked up?

00:14.375 --> 00:18.041
Bobby Wasabi is on his way here right now,
and he's got big news!

00:18.125 --> 00:19.583
I love his entrances.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.417
His last one was so cool. Yeah.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.083
It was not cool.

00:23.166 --> 00:25.792
If you're going to wear a kimono
and fly on a jetpack,

00:25.875 --> 00:27.875
dude, put on some underpants.

00:29.667 --> 00:32.709
Well, this time he promised his entrance
isn't going to be a big deal.

00:32.792 --> 00:36.041
He wants everything quiet and low-key.

00:43.291 --> 00:45.375
Quiet and low-key, huh?

00:46.208 --> 00:49.583
I would've been here sooner,
but we hit a pothole and blew out a ninja.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.667
That is an awesome ride.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.458
I wonder if it's street legal.

00:55.041 --> 00:59.959
It's part hot tub, part rickshaw,
and all partay!

01:01.333 --> 01:03.750
So, Bobby, what's the big news?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.250
I just signed a deal to produce

01:06.333 --> 01:10.083
a brand new martial arts reality show
called...

01:10.166 --> 01:14.250
-
- Wasabi Warrior!

01:16.667 --> 01:20.917
And it's going to take place in a dojo!

01:22.417 --> 01:24.000
Your dojo!

01:24.083 --> 01:25.667
-
- Are you serious?

01:25.750 --> 01:30.083
Five karate students living together
in a world where they must out play,

01:30.166 --> 01:33.041
out fight, and outwit one another.

01:33.125 --> 01:34.417
- Oh!
- You'll be playing

01:34.500 --> 01:37.917
for a brand new Kamasaki water rider!

01:38.000 --> 01:40.125
- No!
- What? Are you serious?

01:40.208 --> 01:43.083
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hang on a second, guys,

01:43.458 --> 01:45.500
we've all seen those reality shows.

01:45.709 --> 01:47.834
Sometimes they bring out the worst
in people.

01:48.458 --> 01:49.792
Yeah, Eddie's right.

01:49.875 --> 01:53.291
I mean, this dojo is a place of honor
where we come to study martial arts and--

01:53.375 --> 01:54.667
All I need is a host.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.834
Oh! Ooh! Please, please, pick me, pick me!

01:57.917 --> 02:00.959
I've wanted to be a reality show host
my whole life.

02:01.417 --> 02:02.542
All right, you'll do.

02:03.125 --> 02:04.583
- I'm a host!
- Yeah.

02:04.667 --> 02:05.709
- I'm a host!
-

02:05.750 --> 02:07.375
I need a fanfare!

02:13.667 --> 02:15.750
This thing is filled with ninja spit.

02:18.250 --> 02:21.500

<i>Milton.</i>

03:13.041 --> 03:14.000
<i>Jerry.</i>

03:16.250 --> 03:21.500
Only one can be the Wasabi Warrior.

03:25.125 --> 03:28.417
Welcome to Wasabi Warrior.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.834
- I'm your host and sensei, Rudy.
-

03:33.542 --> 03:37.000
You're about to enter a world of mental
and physical challenges.

03:37.083 --> 03:40.500
Where you should always expect
the unexpected.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.041
- Wha--
-

03:44.125 --> 03:46.375
- What was that?
- I just blew up my car!

03:46.458 --> 03:49.417
- You didn't expect that, did you?
- No.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.041
Now, go on in
and choose your living space,

03:52.125 --> 03:54.667
and I'll be right back
with your first challenge.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.583
What have I done?
The car's not even paid for yet!

04:02.542 --> 04:06.000
Oh! Check this place out. It's amazing.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.917
- Oh, I call that spot!
I got this one!

04:08.000 --> 04:09.166
-
Yes!

04:09.250 --> 04:10.250
It's all mine.

04:11.709 --> 04:15.500
Uh, what are you doing?
I claimed this spot already.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.917
Okay, you can have it.
I'll take that one over there.

04:19.583 --> 04:21.041
Wait a minute.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.875
If you don't want it
there must be something wrong with it.

04:24.250 --> 04:28.750
Yeah, yeah, I know how these shows work,
you're trying to get inside my head.

04:29.417 --> 04:32.834
Well, it's not going to happen.
This thing's like a rock.

04:36.291 --> 04:37.208
I'm taking that bed!

04:39.458 --> 04:41.667
I really wanted that spot.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.917
It's the closest to the bathroom,
and I'll say it,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.792
I have the bladder of a seventy--

04:47.125 --> 04:48.583
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

04:50.375 --> 04:53.792
Welcome to the Dragon's Playground.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.375
By random draw, Kim, Eddie, and Milton,

04:56.458 --> 04:59.834
this challenge is for you. It's a race.

04:59.917 --> 05:03.250
The first part consists
of the Ball Pit of Despair.

05:03.333 --> 05:06.875
It may look like fun,
but beware of hidden ninjas.

05:08.333 --> 05:11.458
Then you're off to the Banzai Bounce.

05:13.041 --> 05:17.667
Lastly, you have to get through
the Path of the Tiger.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.667
Whoever hits the buzzer first
wins the challenge.

05:22.750 --> 05:23.959
Uh, I have a question.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.333
When you hit the Banzai Bounce,
are you allowed to flip over--

05:26.417 --> 05:28.166
-
- Go!

05:35.583 --> 05:38.583
This should be easy.
I'm built like a flying squirrel.

05:40.458 --> 05:43.250
Except, I don't regurgitate acorns
to attract a mate.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.542
Ninja!

06:15.834 --> 06:19.875
Am I competitive? Sure.
Do I want to win? You bet.

06:19.959 --> 06:21.500
Nothing's going to take me down.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.625
-
- Holy Christmas nuts!

06:34.000 --> 06:36.458
I did it! I did it!

06:36.542 --> 06:38.208
I did it!

06:39.834 --> 06:41.834
Congratulations, Milton.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.542
You've won the challenge.

06:43.625 --> 06:48.458
- Your prize is a gourmet lobster dinner.
- Oh!

06:48.917 --> 06:51.542
I can't believe it! I love lobster.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.917
Milton, before you sit down
for your lobster feast,

06:55.500 --> 06:56.709
you have a choice.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.208
If you eat the lobster,
everyone else in the house eats gruel.

07:01.291 --> 07:05.750
Or, you can eat gruel,
while everyone else eats lobster.

07:15.333 --> 07:18.750
Mmm! Mm, mmm.

07:20.834 --> 07:23.417
Mmm-hmm.

07:28.625 --> 07:31.208
So, how's the gruel?

07:33.083 --> 07:34.458
A little dry.

07:37.834 --> 07:41.291
Jack, first chance we get,
Milton's gotta go.

07:42.166 --> 07:44.166
I was thinking the same thing.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.750
I think I'm done with this one.

07:52.834 --> 07:55.625
- It's mine!
-

08:01.667 --> 08:06.417
Our second challenge
is The Emperor's Bridge.

08:07.125 --> 08:08.875
Jerry and Jack, you're up.

08:08.959 --> 08:12.667
The object is to try
and knock your opponent off the bridge.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.458
If I win that water rider,

08:14.542 --> 08:17.000
I'll finally get some attention
from the girls.

08:17.083 --> 08:19.208
Which I don't get
on my Dad's riding lawn mower.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.917
You have any idea how hard it is
to pick up girls on a lawn mower.

08:23.000 --> 08:23.917
It's hard, yo!

08:26.583 --> 08:29.458
Jerry you'll be fighting
with a pugil stick.

08:30.083 --> 08:35.000
And Jack, since you're a black belt,
you'll be fighting with a feather.

08:35.333 --> 08:39.000
Seriously? A feather?

08:49.166 --> 08:52.208
Ah... Ah... Okay, now--

08:55.583 --> 08:57.291
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

08:57.375 --> 08:59.709
<i>Uy, no, eso no cuenta!
Tenía que estornudar!</i>

08:59.792 --> 09:02.458
Great job, Jack! You won.

09:03.125 --> 09:06.125
-
- And now you have a choice.

09:06.583 --> 09:09.917
A traveling carnival abandoned
this porta-pooper.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.834
Everyone else in the dojo
will have to spend five minutes

09:12.917 --> 09:19.000
- in what we call The Chamber of Horrors.
-

09:19.083 --> 09:23.750
Or you can spare your friends
by doing the five minutes yourself.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.709
I am not making the same mistake
as Milton.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.834
Everyone in the dojo hates him.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.959
Pretty soon we're going to be voting
someone off,

09:31.041 --> 09:33.333
and I am not going home.

09:33.417 --> 09:36.083
I mean, it's a porta-pooper they found
behind a carnival.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.333
How bad could it be?

09:37.417 --> 09:42.458
Oh, sweet mercy!
Let me out, let me out! Oh, it's horrible.

09:42.542 --> 09:45.750
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-

09:45.834 --> 09:49.125
- Okay, that is not good.
- Ew.

09:53.208 --> 09:58.000
- This is where our game takes a little...
-

09:58.083 --> 10:01.333
twist, that you couldn't possibly
have seen...

10:03.208 --> 10:04.166
...coming.

10:04.625 --> 10:06.166
- Now we'll go a--
-

10:06.250 --> 10:11.041
- Would you please stop that?
- I'm sorry. Love the gong.

10:13.125 --> 10:18.625
It's time for a vote to decide which
of you will be going home in shame.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.291
I didn't know they voted people off
on these shows!

10:23.375 --> 10:25.333
I've got to stop reading
and start watching TV

10:25.458 --> 10:27.083
or I'll never get anywhere in life.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.458
I've counted the votes.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.083
And the person voted out of the dojo is...

10:36.166 --> 10:37.250
going home.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.917
And that person is...

10:45.166 --> 10:46.709
one of you.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.750
Who is it? Tell me! Tell me!

10:52.291 --> 10:53.458
It's...

10:55.166 --> 10:56.041
Jack.

10:56.709 --> 11:01.417
What? Wh-- Wh--
After what I did for you people?

11:01.500 --> 11:02.917
You stabbed me in the back!

11:05.291 --> 11:09.375
Ooh, I did not see that coming.

11:12.625 --> 11:14.625
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

11:14.709 --> 11:16.417
I can't believe Jack's gone.

11:16.792 --> 11:19.709
It doesn't feel right. He's our friend.

11:20.917 --> 11:24.375
I'm really going to miss him.
I feel so bad.

11:24.875 --> 11:28.041
I feel so alive!

11:29.792 --> 11:31.333
Jack was the biggest threat.

11:31.417 --> 11:33.917
If we didn't get rid of him,
he would have gotten rid of us.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.208
Poor chump never saw it coming.

11:40.792 --> 11:44.542
Kim, I've got to admit,
voting Jack out was brilliant.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.625
Well, we gotta work together.

11:46.709 --> 11:49.000
It's the only way anyone wins
on these shows.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.250
-
- What's going on?

11:52.542 --> 11:54.166
Did you guys form an alliance?

11:54.250 --> 11:56.792
No, no, no, no, no.
It wasn't like that, man, okay?

11:56.875 --> 11:59.500
We just met in secret and decided to do
whatever it takes to win

11:59.583 --> 12:02.458
and now that I'm hearing it, yes,
absolutely, we have an alliance.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.709
That's not really fair, is it?

12:05.792 --> 12:08.000
Well, you're not going to have to worry
about it for much longer

12:08.083 --> 12:10.250
- because you're out next.
-

12:10.583 --> 12:11.792
What?

12:12.792 --> 12:14.500
You told me Milton was out next.

12:14.583 --> 12:18.417
What? You told me Jerry was next!

12:18.500 --> 12:21.792
- What?
- Everyone just calm down.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.959
I mean,

12:24.041 --> 12:26.583
how much fun was that ball pit?

12:27.083 --> 12:28.959
You know who you can trust in this game?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.333
No one!

12:35.000 --> 12:36.792
We really need to put our names
on these things.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.458
Yeah, yeah, you're right!

12:42.750 --> 12:45.375
Welcome to your next challenge.

12:45.458 --> 12:49.375
It's called the Bonsai Brunch.

12:50.166 --> 12:52.917
They say revenge
is a dish best served cold.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.709
That's why we've brought in
a very special chef,

12:55.792 --> 12:58.709
your old friend... Jack.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.458
Hello, friends.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.959
I put together this menu with you in mind.

13:06.291 --> 13:10.583
At least one of you must clear your plate,
or I'm back in the game.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.250
Martial arts requires focus
and mental toughness.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.041
Those skills are about to be put
to the test.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.125
Hello, Kim.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.458
Maybe you can make a meal out of...

13:22.875 --> 13:25.500
- mealworms.
- I'm out.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.625
- Eddie!
- Oh, come on.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.750
- You wanna see what I have for you?
- Uh-uh, mmm-mmm, mmm.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.834
What's the matter? Cat got your...

13:35.083 --> 13:36.375
tongue?

13:36.458 --> 13:39.500
Oh.

13:39.583 --> 13:43.875
And Milton,
you know what goes great with lobster?

13:45.709 --> 13:47.709
A Panamanian dung slug.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.041
Just pretend like it's a big French fry...

13:52.709 --> 13:54.291
with mucus sacks...

13:54.875 --> 13:57.667
swimming in a nice, green slime sauce.

14:05.709 --> 14:06.583
Okay...

14:08.458 --> 14:12.083
Going down, going down.

14:14.166 --> 14:16.166
Yeah!

14:17.625 --> 14:21.917
Turning around. Coming up.

14:22.417 --> 14:25.291
Coming up!

14:27.959 --> 14:30.125
Jerry, you're our only hope
to get Jack out of the game.

14:30.208 --> 14:32.291
Don't worry, I got this.

14:32.375 --> 14:35.291
Let me warm up
with a couple of appetizers.

14:38.834 --> 14:39.750
Mmm.

14:41.417 --> 14:44.750
- Jerry's gonna do this!
- Hit the road, Jack.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.208
-
- Not yet.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.875
Jerry has to clear his plate.

14:56.917 --> 15:00.291
When I was five, I was sitting
at the beach eating a saltine.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.083
I looked over
and saw my grandmother in a bikini.

15:03.667 --> 15:06.667
Since then, the taste of saltines
brings back that horrible memory.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.583
What I saw was wrong, yo.

15:15.709 --> 15:18.166
It's a cracker, you big baby! Man up!

15:24.917 --> 15:26.583
-
- I can't!

15:29.166 --> 15:31.208
Well, congratulations, Jack.

15:31.375 --> 15:34.542
No one could clean their plate,
so you are back in the game!

15:34.625 --> 15:37.208
Yeah, back in the game, fools!

15:39.875 --> 15:43.000
Jerry, are you okay?

15:43.709 --> 15:46.375
Put a robe on, Nana!
I'm just a little boy!

15:58.041 --> 16:02.125
Okay, look, it's obvious there's a lot of
tension in the air.

16:02.208 --> 16:05.583
Why don't we just take our minds off of it
and play a little game?

16:05.667 --> 16:06.917
What kind of game?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.959
Uh... It's called One-Word Story.

16:10.041 --> 16:12.750
So, we go around in a circle
and make up a story,

16:12.834 --> 16:15.417
but each of us only gets to say one word.

16:15.959 --> 16:18.166
I'll start. This...

16:18.250 --> 16:19.375
- Game...
- Eats...

16:19.542 --> 16:20.375
-Hairy...
- Moose...

16:20.458 --> 16:21.625
Okay!

16:24.250 --> 16:26.041
I have a game. It's called,

16:26.125 --> 16:29.458
You-three-lose-and-I-win-a-water-rider-
on-national-television.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.583
That's right, we're on television.

16:33.417 --> 16:36.417
Hey, everybody, Kim has a crush
on that goth dude

16:36.500 --> 16:39.458
from the yogurt shop
with the detachable ponytail.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.375
I do not!

16:42.834 --> 16:44.959
- Wait, that ponytail's not real?
-

16:45.583 --> 16:47.125
Really?

16:47.750 --> 16:48.917
What are you laughing at?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.208
The first night here,
Jerry cried for his mommy!

16:51.250 --> 16:52.458
- Yeah.
-

16:52.542 --> 16:54.709
-
- What are you laughing at?

16:57.125 --> 16:59.542
Milton can't go to sleep
without his little bunny.

16:59.625 --> 17:02.000
How long have you known about Rondelle?

17:09.709 --> 17:12.166
Wow, that is fun.

17:12.250 --> 17:16.333
Okay, time for the final challenge.

17:16.750 --> 17:20.333
When it's over,
only one warrior will remain.

17:21.125 --> 17:24.458
Oh, it won't be over,
till the blonde's on the water rider.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.709
Right. But which one of us is the blonde?

17:31.250 --> 17:34.667
Welcome to the Hang Tough wall.

17:35.542 --> 17:40.125
The last person to drop will be presented
with the title of Wasabi Warrior

17:40.208 --> 17:42.250
by Bobby Wasabi himself.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.125
You got that right, Rudy.

17:47.709 --> 17:48.917
So that's it?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.250
All we have to do is stand here?

17:51.333 --> 17:54.417
This is gonna be a piece of cake.
I was born standing up.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.583
No, literally, my mother had me on a bus
and there was no empty seats.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.667
Oh, it's more than just standing.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.250
Grab a hold of your peg,

18:04.291 --> 18:07.208
because you're about to hang tough.

18:13.583 --> 18:16.417
Release the Wasabi Wind!

18:19.458 --> 18:21.041
A little breeze doesn't bother me.

18:21.125 --> 18:24.083
I'm not letting go until my butt hits
that water rider.

18:24.166 --> 18:28.000
Guys, I don't know
if I can keep hanging on any longer.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.458
My arms... are getting... so--

18:30.542 --> 18:32.041
Forget it, Jack!

18:32.125 --> 18:36.875
It's time for the Flaming Balls of Fury!

18:36.959 --> 18:40.125
- Whoa!
-

18:40.208 --> 18:41.875
Is this even legal?

18:43.542 --> 18:45.291
Yeah, is that all you got?

18:45.417 --> 18:47.458
You call yourselves ninjas?

18:48.208 --> 18:49.041
Ow!

18:50.500 --> 18:51.750
Nice shot.

18:52.917 --> 18:55.667
You guys must be getting
pretty hungry up there.

18:55.750 --> 19:00.417
We've blended together the delicious
leftovers from our eating challenge.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.709
- The worms, the tongue, the slugs--
- The saltines?

19:04.792 --> 19:08.333
- Yes, Jerry, the saltines!
-

19:10.458 --> 19:14.417
Prepare yourselves for...
the Shower of Shame!

19:24.500 --> 19:26.291
That was disgusting.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.333
Yeah, well, why don't you stop whining and
drop already?

19:29.375 --> 19:31.792
Oh, let's just let Jack win
something again.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.792
We never get tired of seeing that.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.250
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
because you're a little weasel.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.333
- You're a backstabbing liar.
- Yeah!

19:41.417 --> 19:46.500
-
- Stop it!

19:48.125 --> 19:51.792
I tried to warn you about this.
We're supposed to be friends.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.458
Eddie's right. Look at us,

19:56.542 --> 19:59.750
hanging on poles, covered in slop
and yelling at each other.

19:59.834 --> 20:03.834
It's like my mom's book club.
Them ladies get real, yo.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.542
How do we end this?

20:06.625 --> 20:10.667
To save our friendship,
we all drop down together.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.125
He's right. We've got to show everybody

20:13.208 --> 20:16.250
that our loyalty to each other is stronger
than just some dumb prize.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.959
- You guys ready?
Yeah.

20:20.041 --> 20:23.208
One! Two! Three! Go!

20:28.250 --> 20:30.583
Wait a minute. Where's Eddie?

20:30.667 --> 20:33.750
What's up, suckers? Yeah.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.500
Whoa!

20:37.166 --> 20:38.333
Eddie?

20:38.417 --> 20:42.291
- This is unbelievable!
- He was working us the whole time.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.166
We have our Wasabi Warrior!

20:45.250 --> 20:48.250
Well-played, Eddie. Well-played.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.875
No hard feelings, right, guys?
Just playing the game.

20:52.583 --> 20:53.375
Eddie,

20:54.750 --> 20:59.667
you are a lying, conniving snake.

21:00.333 --> 21:05.125
Seriously, dude, that... was... awesome!

21:10.125 --> 21:14.959
Yeah! Whoo!
Oh, hold on, we're about to hit a wave!

21:15.041 --> 21:19.125
- Oh, no! Whoa!
-

21:19.208 --> 21:22.041
Oh, whoa, we're flying now!

21:22.667 --> 21:24.208
How do you stop this thing, Bobby?

21:26.083 --> 21:26.959
Bobby?

21:28.417 --> 21:32.417
- Bobby!
