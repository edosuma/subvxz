00:22.147 --> 00:24.482
<i>My name is Nazan and I'm an addict.</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:26.317
<i>Hi, Nazan.</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:34.826
<i>I've been clean</i>
<i>for four years and one week.</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:37.912
<i>Work is good. They're trusting me again.</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:39.998
<i>For the most part.</i>

00:42.959 --> 00:46.254
<i>We talk a lot here</i>
<i>about setting boundaries, rules.</i>

00:46.337 --> 00:48.381
-North side clear.
-Clear here.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.009
Everybody fall back. Regroup outside.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.261
<i>I'm clean because of those rules.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:56.514
<i>When I was using,</i>
<i>everything went by in a blur.</i>

00:57.098 --> 01:01.770
<i>But now, now I'm seeing details,</i>
<i>things I'd missed.</i>

01:01.853 --> 01:03.313
<i>A feeling I'd missed.</i>

01:04.189 --> 01:06.149
<i>And I pay attention to those feelings.</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:08.902
<i>Sometimes they're right. Sometimes…</i>

01:10.445 --> 01:14.115
<i>But these days, more often than not,</i>
<i>they put me on the right path,</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:16.493
<i>even if it doesn't always seem it.</i>

01:55.907 --> 01:57.534
I think they're over here!

01:57.617 --> 02:00.829
Move, move, move! FBI! Don't move!

02:00.912 --> 02:03.081
The hell took you so long?

02:10.672 --> 02:13.842
That's why they're giving me
another chance with Reza, my son.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.510
Hmm.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.721
It's going to be
our first unsupervised weekend.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.892
Maybe a path to shared custody. We'll see.

02:23.768 --> 02:24.602
Baby steps.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.855
Well, less than baby steps.

02:27.522 --> 02:31.192
-Infant steps. Fetus steps. I don't know.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.153
It's a step. That's all that matters.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.620
And in this corner,

02:42.704 --> 02:45.790
the wrestling champion
of the Lower East Side.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.626
Come on, people!

02:48.710 --> 02:50.211
Number four on Cyber's Most Wanted,

02:50.295 --> 02:52.964
Agent Abbasi takes him down.
Let's hear some applause.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.842
All right, all right,
settle down, settle down.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.720
Thank you for that
excessively warm welcome, Agent Toby.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.308
-Jealous. They're all jealous.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.269
What? I can't be impressed?

03:06.352 --> 03:07.353
Oh, you can be impressed

03:07.437 --> 03:09.189
if you're going to help
with the paperwork.

03:09.272 --> 03:13.526
I mean, just look here
how sexy these forms are.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.070
R84, FT209.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.615
You're a temptress.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.201
-That's inappropriate workplace behavior.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.704
And I would 100% enjoy
the hell out of that, but we're, uh…

03:24.787 --> 03:26.831
We're big into this Diamond Way break.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.666
Oh, yeah? What did you catch?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.544
We got a match on a print
off a shell casing.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.670
That's great.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.173
So? Who's the diamond snatcher?

03:41.721 --> 03:43.640
Hey, congrats on the Jagos thing.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.100
You got a hit on Ava Mercer
and you weren't gonna tell me?

03:46.184 --> 03:49.062
Didn't know our Boy Scout
was the town crier.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.814
Tell me you got more
than a fingerprint and a bullet.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.026
If that's it, do not bring her in.
She'll run rings around you.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.655
Look, I appreciate
that you and Mercer have a history.

03:58.738 --> 03:59.989
I can be helpful on this.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.741
There's nothing to be helpful on.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.954
Odds are it's some mix-up.
She's an uptown lawyer for Christ's sakes.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.580
Ava Mercer may be bent,

04:07.664 --> 04:10.667
<i>but I doubt she's the big bad jewel thief</i>
<i>we're looking for.</i>

04:10.750 --> 04:11.584
We did well.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.419
Yeah?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.547
You think we have enough
to pull off the next heist?

04:16.631 --> 04:18.800
To buy what we want or what we need?

04:18.883 --> 04:21.678
Cracking a state-of-the-art vault
requires special gear.

04:22.595 --> 04:26.057
We'll get what we get, Leo.
We'll make it work.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.642
-Want me to tag along?
-No.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.478
You know Javier prefers me alone.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.772
More reason I should be there.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.865
Jealousy is thin and yellow
because it bites but never eats.

04:49.956 --> 04:50.790
Ava.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.922
Forget something?

05:42.091 --> 05:43.176
Right on time.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.554
Punctuality is so rare in beautiful women.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.391
Come on, Bob. I go alone. That's the deal.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.269
I don't know your man.
I barely know you or Grandpa Joe.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.814
I got blood in the game.
If I want to play, I'll play.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.652
Keep to the back. Don't make waves, okay?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.572
Waves make the boat rock, baby.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.991
-And what is that supposed to mean?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.535
This is everything?

06:09.619 --> 06:11.204
Except for a few holdbacks.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.374
Three hundred.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.917
Three? Fuck that noise.

06:17.126 --> 06:17.960
Um…

06:18.961 --> 06:21.881
We had the evaluation a bit higher.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.842
These will be difficult to move,
given their provenance.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.844
I'll have to find a buyer
outside the States.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.639
I got a bloke in Philly
who'd give a million for that.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.148
Yes. Well, perhaps Philly
would be the place for this transaction.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.068
Useless as tits on a nun.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.694
Where did you find him?

06:43.778 --> 06:45.571
Huh?
Don't start with this shit.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.616
Maybe the next time
you need legal assistance…

06:48.699 --> 06:50.785
What are you saying? Hmm?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.538
-Four hundred.
-Four?

06:53.621 --> 06:55.915
Who's the thief now?

06:56.541 --> 06:57.375
Okay.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.085
Give me one hour for the funds.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.051
<i>-Gracias, bello.</i>
<i>-Ciao.</i>

07:19.605 --> 07:20.440
I'll be outside.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.197
We can do that. Yeah.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.658
Oh, there's a new ice cream place
around the corner.

07:30.741 --> 07:31.909
<i>Can I get a rum raisin?</i>

07:31.993 --> 07:35.288
Whatever you want.
We can also go to the carousel.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.330
Oh!

07:39.584 --> 07:43.087
Mama Foxy loves the carousel.
Does little foxy still love the carousel?

07:43.796 --> 07:45.798
<i>Little foxy loves carousels too.</i>

07:45.882 --> 07:48.092
-Okay, good.
-<i>Come on. Say bye to Mom.</i>

07:48.176 --> 07:49.218
<i>Time to do homework.</i>

07:49.802 --> 07:51.929
<i>Dad says I have to do my science homework.</i>

07:52.013 --> 07:55.516
Oh, okay.
Okay, yeah. Homework is important.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.728
I'm so excited to see you. I love you.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.397
<i>-I love you too. Bye!</i>
-Tell your dad I'm gonna--

08:29.926 --> 08:31.969
You want an armored car?

08:32.053 --> 08:34.388
I want a duplicate of an armored car.

08:34.472 --> 08:38.601
An exact replica that will get us through
the security gate at the SLS vault.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.938
If we fake our way in, we may
be able to get into the loading dock

08:42.021 --> 08:43.940
without setting off alarms.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.484
Then you have to start
with the cab configuration.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.320
I bet those trucks are 132s,

08:49.403 --> 08:52.156
but the suspension's, like, crazy tight

08:52.240 --> 08:54.200
and if we got a heavy load in the back,

08:54.283 --> 08:56.953
we'll be tailing all over the place.
Just no <i>bueno.</i>

08:57.703 --> 08:59.872
Hold up.
There's this bassist from Fairlawn,

08:59.956 --> 09:04.377
his dad had a 2003 Chevy C4500
that's a dead twin.

09:04.460 --> 09:07.171
Get one of those,
I could extend the cab, tweak it up.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.465
Hold up.
I have his number in here somewhere.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.925
Stan, you source that?

09:12.885 --> 09:13.886
Stan!

09:15.054 --> 09:17.223
Stan! Can you get us that truck?

09:17.306 --> 09:20.810
2003 Chevy. Tweak. I'm on it.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.021
Okay, so he didn't
technically graduate with us,

09:24.105 --> 09:27.525
but I'm pretty sure he signed my yearbook
and wrote his phone number.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.110
-Oh.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.154
He drew, um… He drew a penis.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.328
Oxy-petrol's
a beautiful combination, isn't it?

09:39.412 --> 09:40.496
Good job, Judy.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.872
Is it stable?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.458
I mean,
I wouldn't shoot at it or around it,

09:44.542 --> 09:47.420
but, uh, if we're going up against steel
over two inches thick,

09:47.503 --> 09:49.005
we're going to need some heat.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.969
Hey, I got a guy in the Iron Triangle
who can get us a practice safe,

09:55.469 --> 09:58.431
and I thought maybe you and I
could go up there together.

09:59.140 --> 10:03.603
Who's in the mood for Sizzler? Huh?
Don't worry, Uncle Bob's buying.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.564
-How much?
-Four hundred. More than fair.

10:06.647 --> 10:10.026
Mamacita was ready to settle for three,
but I pumped the bloke a little.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.986
What would we ever do without you?

10:12.069 --> 10:14.155
Who eats spaghetti with chopsticks?

10:14.238 --> 10:15.698
Like, a billion people.

10:19.952 --> 10:23.581
Remember what it took to get this.
It's not an open bank.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.542
Truck. Tech. Safes.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.378
Explosives and chemicals.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.007
This should cover all we need
to get into the vault at SLS.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.635
I expect you to come in
on time and on budget.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.054
How come she gets so much?

10:38.721 --> 10:42.892
This is New York, <i>querido.</i>
It's all about real estate.

10:42.975 --> 10:46.771
This building has a full-service
gym and spa for all tenants.

10:46.854 --> 10:51.609
Home to multiple Fortune 500 corporations,
financial institutions,

10:51.692 --> 10:56.947
even a few museums that use our building
as holding facilities for art overstock.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.033
Oh!

10:59.116 --> 11:01.827
-Good afternoon, Mr. Salas.
-Hey, Leighanne. You on a tour?

11:01.911 --> 11:05.456
Yes. This is Roger Salas.
He's been a tenant for seven years.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.208
This is Mallory, um…

11:07.291 --> 11:08.250
-Rosenthal.
-Yeah.

11:09.126 --> 11:13.172
Belgrano Industrial.
End-user optimization.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.257
And you, Mr. Salas?

11:19.387 --> 11:22.890
We protect the things
that are worth protecting. Enjoy the tour.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.396
You asked about our security features.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.730
We're second to none.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.110
So rare to get bare space
like this in Manhattan.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.822
I'll want to make some changes.

11:37.905 --> 11:41.617
Oh, of course.
Every business has its individual needs.

11:42.952 --> 11:47.623
Tell me, Ms. Rosenthal, uh,
what exactly is end-user optimization?

11:47.707 --> 11:51.335
We'll take it.
First and last month in cash?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.422
I'll get started on the paperwork.

11:54.922 --> 11:55.756
Mmm.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.873
<i>In ways that I trusted,</i>

12:28.956 --> 12:30.958
<i>I could see, or appreciated.</i>

12:31.041 --> 12:36.422
<i>Ava Mercer knows Ray Vernon</i>
<i>and she knows where he is.</i>

12:36.505 --> 12:39.759
<i>She's lying. There…</i>
<i>There's something bullshit--</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:50.436
Hmm.
I love you, little rabbit.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.314
I love you, Te-Te.

12:53.397 --> 12:54.857
I can make a snack.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.359
-No.
-You must be hungry.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.404
-I'm okay. Let's just sleep.
-Mm.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.991
Were you a good girl today?

13:06.160 --> 13:09.538
-I'm good everyday, Te-Te.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.058
Hey, uh,
you should not be in here. Ted will flip.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.352
I'm the only one
who really knows her.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.063
Quiet as a mouse.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.403
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Special Agent Gough.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.738
We spoke on the phone.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.157
Are you comfortable
with this interview being recorded?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.159
Am I under arrest?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.495
Of course not.
Just some questions.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.080
Then tape whatever you like.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.542
Family is Spanish, but you came over
from Argentina as a refugee?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.169
Mmm-hmm. Many years ago.
I'm a citizen now.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.171
This was during the Dirty War?

13:59.755 --> 14:03.843
Well, they called it that.
We called it genocide.

14:05.594 --> 14:08.764
No guardian, no sponsor,
your parents gone.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.600
On your own as a child,

14:11.684 --> 14:15.104
no living relatives,
alone in a strange country,

14:16.522 --> 14:17.606
and yet here you are.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.401
Here I am?

14:20.484 --> 14:23.028
A woman with power,
with connections, with money.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.864
You've come a long way.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.701
And yet I can still be
called into the FBI for no reason.

14:28.784 --> 14:32.246
-I wouldn't say there's no reason.
-Then perhaps you get to it.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.041
Do you enjoy
being an attorney, Miss Mercer?

14:36.125 --> 14:39.670
Uh, let's say that I enjoy
doing things I'm good at.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.881
You work
for a lot of questionable people.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.508
I could say the same for you.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.678
Diamond District, you saw the news.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.430
It's been hard to miss. Yeah.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.683
We found a shell casing at the scene
with a fingerprint on it.

14:52.766 --> 14:56.520
When we ran it through our databases,
we got an odd match. You.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.231
I'm wondering how you'd explain that.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.151
I can't say I'm surprised.

15:02.234 --> 15:07.865
About a month ago I reported
two of my guns as stolen to the police.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.159
I own a number of guns

15:10.242 --> 15:13.287
as is my Second Amendment right
as a US citizen.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.790
And like any other responsible gun owner,

15:16.874 --> 15:18.542
I load my own weapons.

15:19.251 --> 15:23.923
So, um, that would explain
my print on the casing.

15:25.674 --> 15:29.720
It's terribly upsetting to think
any of them were used in a criminal act.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.099
You'll excuse me
while I confirm this with the NYPD.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.957
<i>It was Abbasi. I'm sure of it.</i>

15:58.040 --> 16:01.835
That's not good.
You've gotten heat from her before.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.008
We got to take precautions.
Double back for follows.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.680
Nobody can know about this place.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.932
I'll get some burners just in case.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.062
What is your gut telling you?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.150
Do we have a real problem?

16:27.653 --> 16:28.487
No.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.781
No?

16:30.864 --> 16:32.032
No, we're good.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.996
-There is a bigger picture here.
-Here we go again.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.956
He does not understand
what could be at stake.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.000
Did she tell you why she wants to do this?

16:41.083 --> 16:41.917
Ted.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.586
No doubt Agent Abbasi
has experience in this matter,

16:44.670 --> 16:46.880
but due to her prior issues
with Miss Mercer,

16:46.964 --> 16:50.884
I decided it was in the Bureau's
best interest to keep her at arm's length.

16:54.596 --> 16:58.475
Seven years ago, Ava Mercer
lodged a formal complaint against me.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.479
She claimed that I appeared to be
under the influence during an interview

17:02.563 --> 17:05.607
in which she provided info
about a client she believed was in danger.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.237
She claimed that, uh, my failure
to take that information seriously

17:10.320 --> 17:12.031
contributed to her client's death.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.199
And this was during the period when you--

17:14.283 --> 17:16.869
Yes, ma'am. I was using at the time.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.289
I am aware that I was unable

17:20.372 --> 17:22.833
to make proper judgments
about the situation.

17:24.168 --> 17:28.005
Her complaint led,
in part, to my suspension.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.214
I see the complication.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.884
This is not about retribution.
I know how her mind works.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.510
-She has an alibi.
-She manipulates.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.555
-Her information checks out.
-I can consult. That's all I'm saying.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.603
I appreciate that
you have prior knowledge,

17:43.353 --> 17:44.730
but you're too close to it.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.151
Ted is lead on Diamond Way.
Let him handle it as he sees fit.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.695
Yes, ma'am.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.155
Thank you, ma'am.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.079
You've got more than enough
to do on your own cases.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.208
Stay away from Mercer. Understood?

18:04.291 --> 18:07.127
Yeah. You got it.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.634
Here is fine.
Put it there next to the others.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.805
We're going to need more heatsinks
and surge protection.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.891
-Satellite transmitter for the video jam.
-Write it down.

18:20.974 --> 18:24.061
And, uh, maybe a PlayStation
for… for down time.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.479
Write it down.

18:25.562 --> 18:26.563
Cool.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.359
<i>Which is what we mean</i>
<i>by addiction transfer.</i>

18:30.943 --> 18:33.278
Swapping out one addiction for another.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.031
We might overcome drugs or alcohol,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.951
but it just gets replaced
by sex or gambling.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.870
If we haven't done the work,

18:42.496 --> 18:45.833
if we are still blaming someone else,

18:45.916 --> 18:48.335
it's easy to fall back into old patterns.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.297
Okay, let's end
with the third step prayer.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.681
-Take my will and my life.
-And my life.

19:01.390 --> 19:05.227
Guide me to recovery
and show me how to live.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.771
Thanks, everyone. See you next time.

19:16.947 --> 19:17.781
Good job today.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.412
Did your son come in yet?

19:23.495 --> 19:24.496
Week after next.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.748
Already have a sofa made up.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.626
He's so excited, and me too.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.796
Is it strange
that I'm also kind of… nervous?

19:33.505 --> 19:36.175
Oh, he'll be happy
just to spend time with you.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.217
I know.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.847
I just worry
I'm going to screw it up somehow.

19:47.060 --> 19:51.815
Isn't there a point in recovery
when I'm supposed to trust myself?

19:51.899 --> 19:53.901
It's hard to trust the person you are

19:53.984 --> 19:56.403
when you're still attached
to who you were.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.323
Take a chance on yourself,

20:00.240 --> 20:02.659
because I'll bet
you're more right than you know.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.789
We can't get the blueprints
for the vault at SLS.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.208
Thanks to RJ here, what we can do

20:09.291 --> 20:11.126
is explore the plumbing, ventilation

20:11.210 --> 20:13.420
and electric systems
of the surrounding area.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.218
-Yeah.
-No, guys, come on. It… it was nothing.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.304
Oh, uh, short applause. Okay.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.766
I mean, it wasn't nothing.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.935
All right, on to the water systems.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.231
<i>Whatever they're using to move water</i>
<i>is isolated from primary plumbing.</i>

20:39.196 --> 20:43.784
<i>But the wastewater is connected</i>
<i>to the sewer line and that we can track.</i>

21:09.726 --> 21:12.354
<i>The ventilation system</i>
<i>is a little tricky.</i>

21:12.437 --> 21:15.399
<i>Less than a foot wide,</i>
<i>so none of us are getting through it,</i>

21:15.482 --> 21:17.317
<i>but it does snake through the SLS offices.</i>

21:24.950 --> 21:27.411
<i>The vault</i>
<i>has its own electric supply,</i>

21:27.494 --> 21:29.788
<i>but the surrounding offices</i>
<i>use power from the building.</i>

21:29.871 --> 21:33.709
Oh, sorry, sorry, that was
not intentional touching.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.887
Sure that's right?

21:48.515 --> 21:50.183
It's the insides of the building.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.061
I can see it's the inside
of the building, professor.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.896
We can't get through the air vents.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.941
-Or the toilets.
-Or the toilets. Hey. Hell of a point.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.611
And where all the systems intersect,

22:02.112 --> 22:03.864
-we see--
-The vault.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.159
Perimeter hallway here, door here,

22:07.242 --> 22:09.870
circular shaft
which leads down to a base level,

22:09.953 --> 22:12.331
and these sections represent the safes.

22:12.414 --> 22:17.502
Now we can map distances, locations,
alarms, and security clusters.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.213
What are those spider-looking things?

22:20.297 --> 22:23.467
Some sort of electrical mesh?
There's resistor wiring.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.218
Could they be the temperature sensors?

22:25.802 --> 22:28.847
Yeah, those are thermistors
and look at that area over there.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.808
-That's got biometrics written all over.
-That's all wiring.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.685
If that's the entrance, I could do…

22:40.025 --> 22:41.902
You'll make them fat.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.405
Skinny dogs make me sad.

22:49.993 --> 22:50.911
If you get tired--

22:50.994 --> 22:54.581
The day I'm too old to chop some shoulder,
you can put me down.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.044
We've been here a long time.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.306
There are other cities, hmm?

23:15.894 --> 23:18.480
If we wanted to stretch our legs.

23:22.275 --> 23:26.780
I'll stretch mine taking out the dogs.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.076
You can do the onions.

23:32.869 --> 23:33.829
<i>Gracias, Te-Te.</i>

23:34.413 --> 23:36.248
<i>De nada, conejita.</i>

23:41.044 --> 23:42.587
Be good, okay?

23:49.428 --> 23:52.389
-Hey!
-Keep your sausages in check!

23:54.933 --> 23:56.601
Eat shit, jerk.

23:56.685 --> 24:01.648
Son of a bitch, stop fucking around,
you asshole, and fuck off!

24:01.731 --> 24:04.568
Lovely. You kiss
your husband's corpse with that mouth?

24:16.121 --> 24:18.039
Nobody comes to my home, okay?

24:18.123 --> 24:20.375
You want to talk to me,
you do it at the shop.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.918
Do you get it, moron?

24:22.002 --> 24:23.503
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.006
I want to discuss my cut.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.257
Take it up with Leo.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.843
Oh, come on,
we know who pulls the strings.

24:31.761 --> 24:34.222
I don't think old shaky hands
is pulling much these days.

24:35.640 --> 24:39.936
Yeah. I'm not sure
if you two are trying to screw us all.

24:40.896 --> 24:41.813
Maybe you're not.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.776
But I'm thinking an extra 10% might
make me feel a little less raw about it.

24:46.860 --> 24:51.156
You know? Keep me and Judy on the team.
Make it worth our while.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.035
I'll tell you what you're worth.

24:57.037 --> 24:57.913
Nothing.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.583
You're a safe cracker with one hand.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.793
You're an appendix.

25:04.419 --> 25:06.379
You exist only to inflame,

25:07.380 --> 25:11.760
and the moment you're taken out,
everyone will feel a whole lot better.

25:12.552 --> 25:15.055
But we need your wife,

25:15.138 --> 25:18.850
and she seems to be attached to you.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.605
So, here is what I'll give you…

25:24.397 --> 25:27.400
Ten grand and the number
of a hand specialist.

25:28.443 --> 25:34.449
In return, you will never again
step a single foot on my doorstep,

25:35.867 --> 25:40.205
on my block, in my neighborhood.

25:45.710 --> 25:46.920
Oh, shit.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.597
So you were
a half hour late. Big deal.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.140
Harsha's lawyer jumped on it.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.395
"Can't show up to a court date on time.
How's she gonna take care of a kid?"

26:04.521 --> 26:05.355
Probably right.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.733
Hey, come on.
Don't beat yourself up over this.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.194
No, they're doing
a fine job of that for me.

26:11.278 --> 26:15.699
My lawyer handled it, though… for now.
Just on thin ice.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.538
What are you doing here?
Listening to me rant.

26:22.914 --> 26:23.832
Um…

26:26.835 --> 26:28.837
What is this?

26:28.920 --> 26:31.298
It's, uh, an apology plant.

26:31.798 --> 26:32.632
For what?

26:33.967 --> 26:34.801
I just…

26:36.344 --> 26:39.723
I wanted to say sorry
for how I handled the Mercer thing.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.641
Oh, no. If anything,
I'm the one that over--

26:41.725 --> 26:43.393
I should've used more discretion.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.480
But I was probably, uh, showing off a bit.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.067
For you.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.279
That's not necessary.

26:54.863 --> 26:55.989
You are a solid agent.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.241
That's why everyone wants you
on their team.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.786
I think you're an excellent agent.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.882
Thank you for my apology plant.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.383
Yeah.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.179
Oh, don't worry about that.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.473
I'm gonna,
uh, put it back in storage. I was…

27:21.556 --> 27:23.600
You really think
Mercer's part of this?

27:35.403 --> 27:36.237
Okay.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.616
Show me.

27:41.159 --> 27:41.993
Okay.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.500
-This is outside Ava's brownstone.
-Jesus, Nazan.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.793
That's Bob Goodwin.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.045
He's a safe man with a long rap sheet.

27:52.128 --> 27:55.006
If you look closely, you'll notice
he has an injured right hand.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.468
Yeah, okay. Here is the fun part.

27:58.968 --> 28:01.054
Bob is married to a woman named Judy.

28:02.055 --> 28:05.350
Her father was Dr. James Strauss,
a chem professor.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.937
Took her all around the world
until she was 11.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.438
Pretty clean record

28:10.522 --> 28:13.400
except a couple dings
for unlawful possession of ordnance.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.694
She likes to blow shit up.

28:15.777 --> 28:19.197
So I ran all of Bob's aliases
and I got a hit at a motel in Queens.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.157
They checked in
ten days before Diamond Way

28:21.241 --> 28:22.450
and they haven't checked out.

28:23.368 --> 28:27.038
Usual MO is you fence the goods
and get the hell out of dodge, unless…

28:27.122 --> 28:28.415
They're planning something else.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.919
Witnesses give us, what,
six suspects at Diamond Way?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.171
I say these are three of them.

28:35.255 --> 28:38.925
I think Diamond Way was
a funding operation for something bigger.

28:39.008 --> 28:42.762
And all Helman and Ted care about
is delivering a couple heads to SDNY.

28:42.846 --> 28:45.640
I take this to them, they're gonna
shut it down, close the case,

28:45.724 --> 28:47.726
and I'm on the wrong side of this thing.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.686
But on the right side of your career.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.441
You're the one always talking
about rules, about black and white.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.025
Yeah.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.903
Rules are important, they are.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.656
When I grew up, that's all I knew.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.241
Here are the rules, don't break them.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.326
When to eat, when to work, when to pray.

29:05.410 --> 29:09.080
I got good grades, I ran track,
I married the man my parents wanted me to.

29:09.664 --> 29:13.752
Life was clean. Decisions were clean.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.381
After 9/11, I…

29:19.132 --> 29:23.470
I wanted to prove
that I wasn't like them, you know?

29:24.304 --> 29:25.513
So I joined the FBI.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.309
But that meant them taking one look at me

29:29.893 --> 29:32.645
and sending me
to all the mosques to root out radicals.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.649
Stores. Homes.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.657
I spent four years ruining a lot of lives.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.621
Tearing down people that look like me
and came from where I came from.

29:50.663 --> 29:54.751
And I tried to reconcile those feelings
and I couldn't,

29:54.834 --> 29:56.252
so then I started using.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.923
I follow rules today
because they keep me clean.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.133
Make it so I could see my son.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.094
Rules are important if there's a reason,

30:05.178 --> 30:06.805
but if the reason is not good,

30:06.888 --> 30:09.682
then sometimes you got to take those rules
and bend them

30:09.766 --> 30:12.185
so the things
that really matter don't break.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.442
Here you go.

30:28.117 --> 30:30.370
Some people are just born
to be robbed, man.

30:30.453 --> 30:33.039
-I don't even feel bad. That was amazing.
-Poor guy.

30:33.122 --> 30:33.957
Hey, babe.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.585
-Uh, could I get a Pilsner? Please?
-Yep.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.089
Also got a, uh, Yelp check-in

30:41.172 --> 30:43.216
-for some free jalapeno poppers.
-My God.

30:43.758 --> 30:44.717
I'm elite. So…

30:47.011 --> 30:48.721
Look at you two. Thick as thieves.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.306
Fantastic day, man.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.725
-We got a great deal on the truck.
-Mmm-hmm.

30:52.809 --> 30:56.354
Guy owns a chicken farm,
used it to transport poultry.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.606
He wanted 20K, but I know these guys.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.359
They're all softies,
so we tell them we're married.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.570
Yeah, the usual shit.
It wasn't a big deal.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.572
-Must've been some deal.
-And get this.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.783
Jude goes, "Hey, Charlie…"
That's the names that we were using,

31:08.867 --> 31:11.703
-Charlie and Amanda.
-Yeah, pet names. That's adorable.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.789
She goes, "Don't forget to keep
some money for Indigo's surgery."

31:14.873 --> 31:17.417
Like we had a baby girl.
Or would it be a boy or…

31:17.500 --> 31:20.295
Bravo, mate. Bra-fucking-vo!

31:20.920 --> 31:23.506
Could I get a round of shots
for the married couple, please?

31:23.590 --> 31:24.632
Let's get out of here.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.468
What about the wedding night?
Did you pop her cherry?

31:29.596 --> 31:32.348
What? No, man, it wasn't like that.
It was just a--

31:32.432 --> 31:35.476
Must've been better than the night
you went to prison though?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.313
She told me all about that.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.230
No, I--

31:39.314 --> 31:41.482
One little pity fuck and you fall in love.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.860
-I never said that.
-It was a long time ago--

31:43.943 --> 31:45.987
Just like you to fucking take his side.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.572
-Don't talk to her--
-Fuck off.

31:47.655 --> 31:49.240
-Bob! What the fuck?
-Huh?

31:49.324 --> 31:51.659
-Eh?
-Could we get some ice, please?

31:51.743 --> 31:54.287
-Oh, now we're cookin'!
-Come on! Try it again!

31:54.370 --> 31:56.080
Yeah! Now we're cookin'!

31:57.707 --> 31:59.375
What you got? What you got?

32:00.460 --> 32:01.294
Nothing!

32:03.922 --> 32:04.881
I'm sorry.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.637
The stitches ripped. Fuck.

32:13.890 --> 32:14.724
Stan!

32:17.518 --> 32:18.353
Stan!

32:19.938 --> 32:22.398
Stan, wait. Okay. I'm sorry. Just--

32:26.235 --> 32:27.070
He just…

32:27.570 --> 32:29.656
He just says shit to get under your skin.

32:30.531 --> 32:31.908
The night you went in, I…

32:32.951 --> 32:34.285
It's not true. It wasn't--

32:34.369 --> 32:35.995
You need to deal with that shit.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.873
-I know he's an asshole--
-I'm not talking about Bob.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.126
I'm talking about what's inside you
that makes you want to be with him.

32:45.421 --> 32:48.007
Baby, come on. Hey, come back here.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.759
<i>Come on, listen to me.</i>

32:50.343 --> 32:52.011
Hey! Hey! Judy!

32:52.762 --> 32:54.263
What, Bob, you want to hit me?

32:54.347 --> 32:57.100
Fuckin' do it! Show me
what a big fucking man you are!

32:57.183 --> 32:59.102
<i>Listen, just please. Hey.</i>

32:59.686 --> 33:01.270
Look. Look.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.232
Now I wanted to give you this

33:04.857 --> 33:07.151
in a… a better way, but, um…

33:10.530 --> 33:11.572
It's a butterfly.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.951
Yeah, I… I can see that.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.167
What the actual fuck is wrong with you?

33:37.056 --> 33:39.308
Okay. Okay.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.602
If I can't crack safes, what good am I?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.063
No. Maybe you… You can only use your left.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.358
-It's not the end of the world.
-It's the one thing I know how to do.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.654
No, just--

34:12.717 --> 34:15.178
This guy comes back
as Stan Loomis.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.972
Owns a deli called Ham The Man
out in Ridgewood.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.767
It's a legit place, but he's a smuggler
with a bit of a record.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.478
Did three years on a drug charge
at the Washington Correctional,

34:23.561 --> 34:25.521
but since then he's been pretty clean.

34:25.605 --> 34:28.733
We can pull the logs of everyone
who visited Loomis at the WCF.

34:28.816 --> 34:29.692
Yeah, good call.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.236
All right, let's see.

34:33.696 --> 34:37.617
His mom, his mom. His mom.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.828
Ah, here it is. Judy Strauss.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.539
Whoa, whoa, hey. Bob Goodwin.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.791
And just once.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.002
Wait. Washington.

34:49.003 --> 34:52.048
-When did you say Loomis got out?
-About six years ago.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.720
Want to know who else was a guest
at Washington Correctional back then?

34:57.804 --> 35:00.014
-And that would be?
-Ray Vernon.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.391
Ava Mercer's client. And…

35:05.394 --> 35:07.021
Stan Loomis' cellmate.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.400
I was wrong about Mercer.

35:11.484 --> 35:12.527
She's not involved?

35:12.610 --> 35:13.903
Oh, she's involved.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.614
She's just not the ringleader.
She's a spoke on the wheel.

35:16.697 --> 35:18.074
But Ray Vernon's dead.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.952
Except we always suspected
he had a partner.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.663
No one recovered the jewels
he pulled from the last job.

35:23.746 --> 35:27.125
Maybe whoever he was working with
is still out there running things.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.918
We need to find a way inside this team.

35:29.001 --> 35:31.629
Okay. Let's take it to Ted. Get more eyes.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.882
No, no, no. We keep on Mercer,
find a chink in her armor.

35:34.966 --> 35:38.386
-Who says she's got one?
-Oh, everybody has a weak spot.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.100
Okay.

35:44.934 --> 35:45.768
I'm, um…

35:47.770 --> 35:49.438
never gonna say no to you.

35:52.567 --> 35:53.609
You get that, right?

35:59.991 --> 36:02.285
It's… It's not that I don't…

36:04.203 --> 36:06.247
want to, it's just there's…

36:08.666 --> 36:10.084
There's things we can't do.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.049
Sometimes you got to bend a few rules.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.438
Okay. Uh…

36:32.899 --> 36:33.774
Let's, um…

36:36.110 --> 36:37.320
Let's get to work.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.451
Did you get it? Did you get it?

36:44.660 --> 36:45.745
Oh, whoo!

36:46.871 --> 36:47.705
Good news.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.458
We found a replica of the safes
they use in the vault.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.959
Shit, yeah, let me at it.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.421
Bad news.
They got to be spun simultaneously.

36:59.091 --> 37:02.595
Maybe I can get the, um, oxy-petrol
or a plasma torch.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.513
It's high carbon. It'll take hours.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.933
I'll leave you to it then.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.562
Wasn't Stan with you?

37:18.402 --> 37:19.237
Yeah.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.114
Yeah, all right.

37:23.824 --> 37:26.702
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>something's come up. We have to meet.</i>

37:27.954 --> 37:31.791
<i>Midnight. Don't be late. Okay.</i>

37:39.757 --> 37:40.716
-Hey.
-<i>Hey.</i>

37:40.800 --> 37:42.385
<i>I got a convo on the parabolic.</i>

37:42.468 --> 37:45.554
Mercer's meeting a contact in Bushwick.
Bogart and Johnson.

37:45.638 --> 37:46.597
<i>What's she doing there?</i>

37:46.681 --> 37:49.016
Nothing but slaughterhouses
and art galleries.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.893
Buying chickens and mosaics.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.312
I don't know.
It's set for midnight.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.274
All right, well,
let's, uh, grab dinner and post up.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.193
I gotta be in the Bronx
for this emergency thing for Ted.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.653
This is an emergency.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.863
<i>Yeah, but I can't</i>
<i>tell Ted about it, can I?</i>

38:04.073 --> 38:05.491
Look, I would.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.702
Fine, text me the info.
I'll take it alone.

38:07.785 --> 38:08.744
<i>Wait, Nazan, wait.</i>

38:10.496 --> 38:11.497
What if it's a trap?

38:13.749 --> 38:16.335
Then it'll be a shame
you won't be there to save me.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.075
-See anything you like?
-No.

40:33.389 --> 40:34.390
Get the fuck off me!

40:34.932 --> 40:36.058
Hey. Where you going?

40:36.142 --> 40:37.643
Move. Move!

40:43.274 --> 40:44.900
Fuck! Ava!

40:44.984 --> 40:47.278
Ava, stop! I said stop!

40:47.361 --> 40:48.821
Hands where I can see them!

40:55.369 --> 40:56.537
Get off of me!

40:57.079 --> 40:58.289
Get off of me!

40:58.873 --> 41:01.667
-Do you have other weapons?
-I'm an FBI agent, you dumb fuck!

41:01.750 --> 41:02.918
Ma'am, stay still.

41:03.502 --> 41:06.380
Hey, Travis. What's this?

41:07.840 --> 41:08.966
Huh?

41:09.049 --> 41:10.050
You're under arrest.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.261
<i>You shouldn't have poked the bear.</i>

41:12.344 --> 41:15.097
<i>I didn't poke it. I put it down.</i>

41:15.598 --> 41:16.807
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

41:17.349 --> 41:19.894
Only a matter of time
before she makes the connection.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.188
<i>What? Do you want to close up shop?</i>

41:23.230 --> 41:25.232
No. Too close now.

41:25.774 --> 41:28.861
We stay careful. We take precautions.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.821
We are already doing that.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.076
So what's the play?

41:40.748 --> 41:41.582
It's me.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.001
No.

41:44.543 --> 41:47.505
<i>Listen, if I jump off now,</i>

41:47.588 --> 41:50.090
Abbasi has nothing on you

41:51.091 --> 41:53.636
and you get to finish what you started.

42:00.017 --> 42:00.851
Okay.

42:05.689 --> 42:06.982
Listen, Gene, you have--

42:07.066 --> 42:08.484
I understand. Listen to me.

42:08.567 --> 42:11.695
You have to explain to the judge
it happens in my line of work.

42:11.779 --> 42:13.489
I… I…

42:13.572 --> 42:16.200
No, no, no, they can't.
I wasn't even charged!

42:16.283 --> 42:19.203
They can't do that.
They can't… They can't take custody.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.872
I'm very calm, I'm…

42:21.956 --> 42:25.334
Yeah. Yes. Okay.
But can you call me back, please?

42:27.503 --> 42:28.671
Fuck me.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.245
Good, easy.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.339
Hi, Te-Te. I've arrived.

43:24.143 --> 43:24.977
Te-Te?

43:36.071 --> 43:37.197
Teresa?

44:12.441 --> 44:14.902
They took away
custody of my son.

44:14.985 --> 44:16.028
You never had it.

44:18.947 --> 44:21.283
-They took away the possibility.
-Where is she?

44:32.795 --> 44:34.963
For someone
who knows her way around red tape,

44:35.047 --> 44:37.883
I'm surprised you never
got her citizenship squared away.

44:38.759 --> 44:42.596
She's been asking for her <i>conejita.</i>
Little rabbit?

44:44.973 --> 44:47.601
When I was a child,

44:49.228 --> 44:52.314
I was hard to catch.

44:55.609 --> 44:56.694
She a relative?

44:57.945 --> 44:59.029
She was my nanny.

44:59.780 --> 45:03.367
She helped me escape and watched over me.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.078
Think of a woman her age

45:06.161 --> 45:09.289
being sent back to a country
she hasn't seen in 40 years.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.834
All alone, no family.

45:13.502 --> 45:15.379
At least the government's better now.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.882
You think any of them are good?

45:19.800 --> 45:20.759
I think some try.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.094
Which ones?

45:23.053 --> 45:25.973
Spain, where Franco killed my cousins?

45:27.683 --> 45:32.062
Argentina, where Videla
disappeared my parents?

45:33.981 --> 45:35.232
Or the United States

45:35.941 --> 45:39.987
with their agents who kidnap old women
to get what they want?

45:40.070 --> 45:42.781
Hey, I didn't kidnap anyone.
ICE picked her up.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.324
They're just doing their job.

45:46.410 --> 45:47.327
This is your play?

45:48.746 --> 45:49.913
I sleep at night.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.623
How's it working out for your family?

45:51.707 --> 45:53.333
Better than it's working out for Teresa.

45:59.131 --> 46:01.049
Now, I have some friends at ICE.

46:01.133 --> 46:02.843
They owe me a few favors.

46:04.094 --> 46:06.555
Teresa's scheduled for
a deportation hearing on Tuesday

46:06.638 --> 46:09.767
and a flight out of the country
could be as early as next week,

46:10.893 --> 46:12.311
unless I make that call.

46:15.355 --> 46:16.648
What do you want?

46:17.691 --> 46:18.859
I want you to flip.

46:20.235 --> 46:21.361
I don't know anything.

46:21.445 --> 46:22.571
I don't believe that's true.

46:23.155 --> 46:25.866
Even if it is, I could use you as my mole.

46:26.450 --> 46:30.704
I know a few hundred grand in diamonds
was not the end goal for you or your crew.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.916
Crew? What are you talking about?

46:33.999 --> 46:37.336
Bob Goodwin. Stan Loomis. Judy Strauss.

46:37.419 --> 46:39.171
Bet I could crack one of them,

46:39.254 --> 46:41.340
that would leave you out in the cold.

46:41.965 --> 46:43.217
And Teresa…

46:49.932 --> 46:52.726
They know I've been compromised.

46:53.769 --> 46:56.313
I'm out. That door is closed.

46:56.396 --> 46:59.399
We both know you got the skills
to burrow your way back in.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.073
And show me how to live.

47:07.699 --> 47:10.160
All right, thanks so much everybody.

47:10.244 --> 47:13.413
I just want you to know
how courageous I thought you were today.

47:31.014 --> 47:31.849
Hey.

47:33.308 --> 47:34.935
What's up? I came as fast as I could.

48:45.380 --> 48:46.548
I want back in.
