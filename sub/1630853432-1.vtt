00:44.250 --> 00:48.500
- Hello, hello. Good morning.
Come along now.

00:48.625 --> 00:52.375
Simon, no headphones.
You'll get these back after school.

00:52.458 --> 00:55.791
Betty, you're not Donald Duck!
Put some pants on, please!

00:56.166 --> 00:58.041
-- Okay. What's the first thing...
-Okay, kids. Have fun at school!

00:58.125 --> 00:59.208
-...that pops into your head...
-Bye, Dad!

00:59.333 --> 01:01.000
-...when I say Chip 'n Dale?
-Hey, stop bumping me!

01:01.083 --> 01:03.291
I'm willing to bet
it's Thomas Chippendale,

01:03.375 --> 01:06.500
the London-based
cabinet maker from the 1700s.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.416
Sick cabinet, Thomas!

01:08.541 --> 01:12.083
But I bet the second thing
that pops into your head are these guys.

01:12.375 --> 01:15.958
But certainly, third would be
those rascally cartoon chipmunks,

01:16.041 --> 01:19.250
Chip 'n Dale,
or should I say Chip and me?

01:19.333 --> 01:21.125
And it all started the day we met,

01:21.208 --> 01:24.625
when I had to join a new school
in the middle of third grade.

01:24.708 --> 01:28.000
Hello, potential new friends!

01:29.208 --> 01:33.375
We have a new student today.
Everyone, say hello to Dale.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.041
Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you!

01:40.958 --> 01:42.333
Uh...

01:42.416 --> 01:43.916
I know.

01:45.125 --> 01:49.083
-My eye! It's in my eye!

01:50.375 --> 01:53.208
-No, no, no, no.
-- Get it out!

01:54.041 --> 01:55.500
Uh...

01:55.583 --> 01:58.583
-It's a joke. See? I'm fine.

01:59.041 --> 02:02.083
-Ew. You're weird.

02:07.125 --> 02:10.458
- By lunchtime,
no one wanted anything to do with me.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.250
So, I had to sit alone.

02:17.791 --> 02:21.416
-Hey. Mind if I sit?

02:23.625 --> 02:28.125
That pencil thing you did was hilarious!
It was excellent comic timing.

02:28.416 --> 02:32.041
-Really? I kind of wish I hadn't done it.
-No way, man.

02:32.208 --> 02:34.708
The biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all.

02:34.958 --> 02:38.125
You just didn't set up the joke right.
I can help you if you want.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.833
-The name's Chip.
-I'm Dale.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.791
So, do you watch Crispy Cow?

02:42.958 --> 02:44.708
-Hey! That's my milk!
-Hey! That's my milk!

02:44.833 --> 02:46.875
-- Chip was so funny and thoughtful

02:46.958 --> 02:48.083
-about everything.
-So good!

02:48.166 --> 02:50.833
- And I never thought about anything.
We were perfect together.

02:50.958 --> 02:53.458
Friendship is rare
Do you know what...

02:53.541 --> 02:55.625
-- Come on!
-- And even though,

02:55.708 --> 02:56.916
-we were in the same grade...
-Follow me!

02:57.041 --> 02:59.458
...Chip was like the older brother
I never had.

02:59.583 --> 03:03.000
He introduced me to cheesy crust pizza
and funny, old movies.

03:05.375 --> 03:07.458
- By high school we were headlining
the talent show.

03:07.541 --> 03:11.833
And for our grand finale,
The Amazing Dale will juggle everything!

03:11.916 --> 03:13.291
Hey!

03:13.625 --> 03:17.125
-Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ah!

03:17.208 --> 03:22.125
- We knew we had something special.
So, after graduation, we packed our bags

03:22.250 --> 03:24.625
-and headed to California.
-You're late! Come on!

03:24.791 --> 03:26.791
Move, move, move! Here, catch!

03:27.833 --> 03:30.041
-Nice one!
-- Aw.

03:37.833 --> 03:40.375
Hello, potential new friends!

03:40.458 --> 03:43.500
Goodbye, eclectic group of bus passengers.

03:43.708 --> 03:46.500
Oh, what if I did something like,
"I'm into nuts."

03:46.666 --> 03:48.791
Good, good.
I love it. Great stuff.

03:48.958 --> 03:51.458
- Those first few months,
we were flat broke,

03:51.541 --> 03:53.458
but they were some
of the best times of my life.

03:54.791 --> 03:58.666
...when you're off, everyone knows.
So be on, with Fresh-On Deodorant...

03:58.791 --> 04:01.208
-Whoa! Whoa!
-We look great.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.708
- And after landing a few small parts,

04:04.791 --> 04:07.958
we finally got the call
that would change everything.

04:08.041 --> 04:11.333
- Chip, Dale,
how would you like your own show?

04:13.625 --> 04:16.166
-Sometimes some crimes
-- Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.625
-We had finally done it!
-Go slipping

04:17.708 --> 04:19.208
-- Our own TV show.
-Through the cracks

04:19.375 --> 04:20.875
- It was about a group
of little detectives...

04:20.958 --> 04:22.750
-But these two, Gumshoes
-...who would solve big crimes.

04:22.833 --> 04:25.125
-There was the adventurer, Monterey Jack.
-Are picking up the slack

04:25.208 --> 04:27.333
-- The inventor, Gadget Hackwrench...
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!

04:27.458 --> 04:29.375
-...and Zipper, a fly.
-Rescue Rangers

04:29.458 --> 04:31.750
- His things were, he was small
and he couldn't speak,

04:31.875 --> 04:33.333
-a double threat.
-When there's danger

04:33.416 --> 04:34.958
Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!

04:35.125 --> 04:36.833
- And then there was Chip and I,

04:36.916 --> 04:40.416
we were a classic odd couple
with Chip as the logical straight man...

04:40.500 --> 04:42.625
-Pass me that pipe. I've got an idea.
-...and me as the fun-loving goof.

04:42.708 --> 04:45.875
-Right, what are you gonna do with it?
-You're mine now.

04:47.833 --> 04:53.708
Ah.
Why you little... Come here, you.

04:55.041 --> 04:59.583
-No!
-I guess the cat's in the bag.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.666
-And cut. That's a wrap, folks.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.708
Nice work, everyone!
Great job!

05:20.708 --> 05:25.458
And so, I just wanna thank all of you
for the greatest three years of my life.

05:25.708 --> 05:28.000
When I think back
to where this all started,

05:28.291 --> 05:32.791
me finding Dale sitting all alone
in the cafeteria, so sad.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.416
-Well, I wasn't that sad.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.625
That's funny.

05:36.708 --> 05:39.875
But never in my wildest dreams
did I think we'd be here now.

05:40.083 --> 05:43.375
So, to you, Dale, my best friend,
and to all of you.

05:43.458 --> 05:47.375
-And to everyone who loves a short toast.
-Okay. Okay.

05:47.458 --> 05:50.916
To many more seasons
of the Rescue Rangers. Cheers!

05:51.041 --> 05:52.541
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

05:52.625 --> 05:53.958
-Over here. Get together.

05:54.083 --> 05:57.583
-Everybody say, "Cha-cha-cha-cheese!

06:00.541 --> 06:03.375
-One, two, tell me what you're...
-- We were living the dream.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.458
High on the hog, all night long,
dancing the "Roger Rabbit,"

06:07.583 --> 06:10.125
-with Roger Rabbit.
-- Go, Roger. Go, Roger. Go, Roger.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.625
-Go, Roger.
-- Boy, what a party.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.375
Oh, zipper.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.958
Oh, yeah. I love this.

06:17.583 --> 06:19.833
-I am into nuts!

06:20.416 --> 06:23.000
-So good. Again, again.
-- Those were some crazy fun times.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.250
-I'm into nuts.

06:25.708 --> 06:27.916
-So awesome.
-- Super fun.

06:28.625 --> 06:29.791
So fun.

06:32.750 --> 06:38.541
Now, that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

06:38.666 --> 06:41.291
Hey, where'd you run off to, buddy?
I saved you a piece of cake.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.500
-What's that?
-Okay.

06:43.583 --> 06:49.083
I wasn't gonna show you this right now,
but it just got delivered. So... Ta-da!

06:49.250 --> 06:52.875
"Double-0 Dale"?
That's hilarious. What is that?

06:53.041 --> 06:57.041
It's wild, right? It's my new show.
I'm gonna be a super spy.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.000
Wh... what are you talking about?

06:59.083 --> 07:01.916
Yeah, I'm really going for it.
And just like you always say,

07:02.041 --> 07:05.458
"The biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all."

07:06.041 --> 07:09.375
-Wait, you really have a new show?
-- Yep!

07:09.458 --> 07:12.000
Wh... why didn't you
talk to me about it first?

07:12.125 --> 07:13.250
We tell each other everything.

07:13.416 --> 07:16.041
You've told me what you had
for lunch the last 42 days.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.291
Pineapple pizza and a diet Slice.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.208
-Exactly.
-- I don't know.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.833
I just wanted to make sure
the show was gonna happen first,

07:22.916 --> 07:25.833
-before I got your hopes up.
-My hopes up? What?

07:25.916 --> 07:28.791
Yeah! It's good news for everyone.
Check this out.

07:28.875 --> 07:31.958
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

07:32.083 --> 07:33.625
-I just...

07:33.958 --> 07:36.708
If you do this,
they might cancel the show.

07:36.791 --> 07:39.833
No, they won't do that. I mean,
everyone knows you're the favorite.

07:39.916 --> 07:41.666
And I'm just the guy
who gets hit in the head

07:41.791 --> 07:43.208
with a pipe each week. It's fine.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.458
Okay, so, you're gonna risk
all of Rescue Rangers

07:45.541 --> 07:47.541
because I'm a little
more popular than you?

07:47.666 --> 07:49.291
Do you know how dumb that is?

07:49.833 --> 07:52.541
Well, I am the dumb one.

07:52.875 --> 07:57.125
-I didn't mean it like that.
-I know. You never mean it.

07:57.208 --> 07:59.583
Look, you're always acting
like you saved me or something.

07:59.666 --> 08:02.500
But when we were kids,
we were in it together.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.291
What are you talking about?
We're still in it together.

08:05.583 --> 08:08.625
I'm sorry, Chip.
I'm just done being second banana.

08:09.041 --> 08:10.666
But you're not second banana.

08:10.833 --> 08:13.625
I'm a banana
and you're just another banana.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.541
-Two bananas.

08:17.291 --> 08:22.208
-Please, don't get that.
-But it could be my agent, Dave Bolinari.

08:22.291 --> 08:25.666
After everything I've done for you,
do not pick up that phone.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.000
-I'm sorry.
-Dale, stop.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.708
-We're not done talking.
-I have to.

08:30.916 --> 08:34.125
Do not. Do not do it.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.541
I'm so sorry. Go for Dale.

08:37.666 --> 08:40.125
Hey! Dave Bolinari.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.083
- Rescue Rangers
was canceled that summer,

08:42.166 --> 08:44.833
and Double-0 Dale
was scrapped after the pilot.

08:46.708 --> 08:49.958
-- Dale, you still there?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

08:50.416 --> 08:52.208
- It wasn't anyone's fault
in particular,

08:52.291 --> 08:54.875
just one of those showbiz things.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.333
But now, we're ready to bring it back.

08:58.541 --> 09:03.291
Rescue Rangers 2.0! Starring me.
Now in new and improved 3D.

09:03.375 --> 09:06.291
-- Ladies and gentlemen...
-Oh, wow. You hear that?

09:06.458 --> 09:10.541
-...are you ready for the star of the day?
-Well, that's my cue to go.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.875
This has been chapter one of Dale's Tales.

09:12.958 --> 09:16.125
If you liked it, please don't forget
to subscribe below.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.958
- You know him from
The Disney Afternoon.

09:20.041 --> 09:22.291
Please, welcome to the stage...

09:22.583 --> 09:24.125
Gotta go, bye!

09:24.500 --> 09:27.291
-...Baloo!
-Well, now.

09:27.375 --> 09:29.916
Who here likes a little jazz music?

09:30.375 --> 09:35.083
Look for the bare necessities

09:35.208 --> 09:37.166
-The simple bare necessities

09:37.250 --> 09:41.083
Pardon moi, Dale, but your followers,
they believe the crowd is for you?

09:41.291 --> 09:43.041
Of course they do, Lumiere.
And pretty soon,

09:43.125 --> 09:44.416
\that crowd is gonna be for me.

09:44.583 --> 09:49.208
Yeah, Dale! I'm going to be up
on that stage too, right beside you!

09:49.375 --> 09:53.083
-Yes, Ugly Sonic. That's the spirit.
-And they'll like me for who I am,

09:53.166 --> 09:56.541
not like last time when the internet
got one look at my human teeth,

09:56.666 --> 09:59.875
and burned the place down.
Okay, let's see here.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.541
"Best wishes, Ugly Sonic."
There you go, kid.

10:03.541 --> 10:06.125
-Oh, they're laughing at me. I know that.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.208
You can't hurt my feelings
if I'm in on the joke.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.958
-Are you though?
-Yes!

10:10.250 --> 10:13.000
Anyway, now my luck has shifted.

10:13.166 --> 10:16.833
I've been offered a new reality show
where I do ride-alongs with the FBI.

10:16.916 --> 10:20.833
It's called Ugly Sonic, Uglier Crimes.

10:21.041 --> 10:25.791
-Really? A TV show? You?
-Yeah, is that so difficult to believe.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.125
Oh, uh...

10:29.291 --> 10:32.625
-I guess... not.

10:34.833 --> 10:36.291
-Yeah, you know what?

10:36.375 --> 10:39.375
That's great.
When one of us succeeds, we all succeed.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.250
Baloo was part of the Disney Afternoon
just like me.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.375
Then he got The Jungle Book
reboot and boom,

10:43.500 --> 10:45.708
he's back on top. It happens that fast.

10:45.791 --> 10:46.875
Bravo, Dale!

10:47.000 --> 10:50.958
Your positivity is infectious. Oh, merci!

10:51.500 --> 10:53.750
Oh, I really needed that cash.

10:53.916 --> 10:56.958
You just gotta stay prepared.
I'm keeping myself fit and you know,

10:57.041 --> 10:58.583
my updated modern look?

10:58.750 --> 11:02.250
Yes, Dale, your CG surgery
was done very tastefully.

11:02.416 --> 11:04.583
-You look amazing.
-Well, thank you, Tigra.

11:04.708 --> 11:06.333
-We should hang out sometime.
-Nah.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.375
-Meanly fast.
-No offense,

11:08.458 --> 11:12.250
but don't you think you'd have more fans
here if Chip did these events with you?

11:12.958 --> 11:17.208
Oh, Chip? Oh, that's interesting.
I hadn't thought about him in a while.

11:17.375 --> 11:20.291
I should give him a call.
See how life's treating him.

11:20.458 --> 11:25.083
Life is the worst,
which is why you need good insurance.

11:25.208 --> 11:28.708
Look, I'm not gonna put
on the hard sell, but in my experience,

11:28.791 --> 11:31.958
bad things happen all the time.
They happen without warning.

11:32.041 --> 11:34.041
Sometimes from the last place
you'd expect it,

11:34.166 --> 11:37.833
and you're left to pick up the pieces.
So, you have to protect yourself.

11:37.916 --> 11:40.916
If you're prepared for the worst,
the worst isn't so bad.

11:41.041 --> 11:45.041
So, why risk it? It's my job
to pull the wool off your eyes...

11:47.458 --> 11:50.583
-figuratively.
-You know, I'll take the whole package.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.333
Fantastic. You're making the right choice.

11:59.625 --> 12:02.541
Hey, hey. Congrats!
Employee of the month again.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.958
-- Thanks, Bruno.
-Wanna get a drink to celebrate?

12:05.041 --> 12:06.583
Yeah, you never hang out.

12:06.791 --> 12:09.625
Sorry, everyone. Can't tonight.
Millie's waiting for me.

12:09.875 --> 12:10.958
But thanks for the invite.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.041
Are you sure you don't wanna
see my new pad?

12:13.125 --> 12:16.125
Oh, pad.
Frog-based humor. No, thanks.

12:16.208 --> 12:19.666
That's just a taste of what you
get from me outside the work environment.

12:23.208 --> 12:27.208
-Good evening, Chip.
-Hello, Mrs. House, thank you.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.083
-Millie, I'm home.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.458
Flounder's disappearance
marks the sixth

12:55.541 --> 12:58.958
notable cartoon to go missing
in the last two months...

13:01.750 --> 13:04.791
-Oh, ho ho. Get over here.

13:04.958 --> 13:08.625
Oh, there's my wittle girl.
You've been cooped up all day?

13:08.916 --> 13:11.375
Okay, okay. You must be hungry.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.583
Yup!

13:15.583 --> 13:19.916
-There you go. All right, slow down.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.291
-Calling all chipmunks!
-The chipmunks are back.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.333
-Yeah!
-And this time, they're rapping.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.083
Let's go! Chipmunks
Here for more, so...

13:31.166 --> 13:35.750
Of course, they're rapping.
They always have to make the cartoons rap.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.000
It's time to dance...

13:38.875 --> 13:42.833
Ooh, a message on my landline.
I don't like that.

13:44.041 --> 13:46.833
- G'day, Chipper!
It's me, Monterey Jack.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.291
-Monty?
-- Hey!

13:48.375 --> 13:50.333
I know we haven't spoken in a long time.

13:50.416 --> 13:54.208
But I'm in a heck of a lot of trouble.
And I could use some help from a friend.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.250
I'd really appreciate
if you could come and see me at my place.

13:57.416 --> 13:59.708
All right, gotta go. Hope to see you soon.

14:01.625 --> 14:02.833
Oh, wow.

14:06.291 --> 14:09.541
It's been so long.

14:30.541 --> 14:31.791
-Quick!

14:31.875 --> 14:35.458
-Get in while the coast is clear.
-Oh, Monty. It's you.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.833
I'm sorry about that, mate,
but they're watching.

14:37.916 --> 14:40.125
-They're always watching.
-Who are?

14:41.541 --> 14:46.458
-Oh, it's been too long, Chip.
-It really has, old buddy.

14:47.250 --> 14:50.000
I... I'm sorry, Monty,
but what is that God-awful smell?

14:50.125 --> 14:53.000
What? You don't remember?
Rescue Ranger's cologne.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.583
I wear it every day.

14:54.666 --> 14:58.500
Oh, no. I remember. It smells like
almond butter and gasoline.

14:58.666 --> 15:01.000
And it's very difficult to wash out.

15:01.083 --> 15:04.583
Right. So, Monty, what's going on?
I got your voicemail.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.125
You said you were in trouble?

15:06.625 --> 15:11.083
I screwed up, Chip.
My love of cheese got the best of me.

15:11.208 --> 15:15.625
-And I bought more than I could pay for.
-Oh, no. Cheese? Monty.

15:15.708 --> 15:21.250
I know, I know. But I haven't had so much
as a whiff in weeks. I'm dairy-free.

15:22.458 --> 15:25.666
-Really? Then what's that?
-Oh, crud.

15:25.791 --> 15:29.000
It's a really stinky Gorgonzola.
You weren't supposed to see that.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.833
Ch... ch... ch... ch... ch...
ch... cheese!

15:31.916 --> 15:33.208
Hang on, Monty.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.916
Ugh...

15:41.000 --> 15:45.541
I'm sorry, Chipper.
I just love it so much.

15:45.666 --> 15:48.333
It's okay, Monty. We'll get you some help.

15:48.458 --> 15:53.083
It's not just that, Chip. Now, I owe
a ton of money to the Valley Gang.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.958
The Valley Gang?
Monty, those guys are bad news.

15:56.041 --> 15:59.750
I know. And if I can't pay up,
they're gonna bootleg me.

15:59.916 --> 16:01.833
"Bootleg you"? What does that mean?

16:01.916 --> 16:05.541
Oh, Chip. It's gotten rough out there
for us old-timers.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.875
Did you hear what happened
to that little guy, Flounder?

16:07.958 --> 16:09.958
When he fell behind on krill payments?

16:11.666 --> 16:12.958
Oh, no!

16:13.125 --> 16:18.541
-Time to pay up, fish.
-Um. How about this? Isn't it neat?

16:18.708 --> 16:22.000
Come on, fellas.
This is a genuine Dinglehopper.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.916
It's worth a lot. Oh!

16:24.041 --> 16:28.833
- So, they kidnap the bloke,
erase his mouth so he can't scream,

16:28.958 --> 16:31.541
then change him around to try to sneak by

16:31.833 --> 16:34.833
the copyright laws,
and then smuggle him overseas

16:35.000 --> 16:39.083
to a black-market studio,
where he'll spend the rest of his life

16:39.208 --> 16:43.916
being forced to make
terrible bootleg movies.

16:44.208 --> 16:48.375
Oh, no, that's awful.
We can't let that happen to you.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.458
-We'll figure something out.
-You mean it?

16:50.583 --> 16:53.125
Of course, you were always
such a good friend to me.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.875
You never let me down.
I've really missed you, you big galoot!

16:56.958 --> 17:01.000
Oh, I missed you too, Chipper.
I know Gadget and Zipper miss you also.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.916
-Yeah? How are they doing?
-Oh, they're great.

17:04.250 --> 17:08.291
-Forty-two kids and counting.
-- Wow, look at that.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.083
That one's got Gadget's eyes
and Zipper's wings.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.833
And that one's got
her ears and hands, cute.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.083
We had some good times, didn't we, pal?

17:17.291 --> 17:19.375
Aye, the best.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.708
-They're here! Hide!

17:24.208 --> 17:25.208
- Hello?

17:27.250 --> 17:28.250
Is that...

17:28.875 --> 17:31.250
That's 59 steps
to get up to your apartment.

17:31.333 --> 17:33.000
You do a couple of those a day
and you're in...

17:33.083 --> 17:35.125
-Quick! Get in!
-Okay.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.083
Oh.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.833
-Dale...
-Chip.

17:40.708 --> 17:43.291
-Hey.
-Yep, it's me.

17:43.791 --> 17:46.583
-Cool.
-Yeah, I called Dale for help also.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.958
-I hope that's okay.
-Yeah, why wouldn't it be okay?

17:49.041 --> 17:51.583
I mean, it is, uh, okie-dokie artichokie.

17:51.708 --> 17:55.250
-"Artichokie"? For real?
-Yes. "Artichokie."

17:55.375 --> 17:57.250
So, you're not still mad
about all the stuff with,

17:57.375 --> 17:59.791
you know, Double-0 Dale
and Rescue Rangers getting canceled?

17:59.958 --> 18:03.375
Mad? No. I'd be pretty pathetic
to care about something

18:03.500 --> 18:04.708
from that long ago.

18:05.083 --> 18:09.500
Oh. Okay. I mean, you can care a little
if you want to. I mean, I care, but...

18:09.625 --> 18:13.083
-So, what's been up with you?
-Oh, you know this, that,

18:13.166 --> 18:16.166
other vague things
to fill the space of this conversation.

18:16.291 --> 18:22.166
-Okay, well, you look the same.
-Yeah. Thanks. And you look... different.

18:22.375 --> 18:25.333
Ah! Hey, it's no secret
I had the CGI surgery done

18:25.458 --> 18:27.583
and it's done wonders
rejuvenating my career.

18:27.666 --> 18:29.791
I'm actually starring in a play tonight...

18:32.375 --> 18:36.083
But, man, I tell you
the real hot ticket is Rescue Rangers.

18:36.166 --> 18:39.291
There's even some buzz about a reboot.
Someone started a Facebook fan page

18:39.458 --> 18:42.750
-for it and everything.
-Crikey! A Facebook fan page?

18:42.833 --> 18:46.000
-They don't just give those away.
-Oh, he's full of it, Monty.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.375
No one's talking about
a Rescue Rangers reboot except for him.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.500
What? The fans are hungry for it.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.708
Look, I came here to help Monty,
not get caught up

18:54.791 --> 18:56.083
in some Hollywood nonsense.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.750
So, great to take this skip
down memory lane,

18:58.833 --> 18:59.833
but I've gotta go.

18:59.958 --> 19:03.416
Monty, if you're really in trouble,
you know how to find me.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.250
Dale, you were also here.

19:09.625 --> 19:14.625
Come over to try and help Monty,
ambush me, talking about a reboot...

19:15.166 --> 19:18.083
think they can squeeze a dollar
out of essentially nothing.

19:18.541 --> 19:20.625
He's the one that quit the show
in the first place.

19:20.791 --> 19:22.416
I've been fine without it.

19:23.125 --> 19:25.333
It's garbage. Total garbage.

19:25.416 --> 19:27.875
That's why it's better
to not even have friends.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.791
Okay, yeah, that one looks pretty good.

19:34.875 --> 19:35.958
- So weird, I mean...

19:36.041 --> 19:37.541
- It's, like,
"What are you talking about?"

19:37.625 --> 19:39.916
Totally. Hey, guys, you wanna hang
after the show tonight?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I know a great place
for cheesy-crust pizza.

19:42.083 --> 19:45.791
Oh, um, I'm sorry, man,
but we got other plans, you know?

19:45.916 --> 19:47.000
Yeah.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.166
I think the ironic guest performer
wants to be friends.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.208
Go for Dale.

19:55.208 --> 19:59.583
E.T. forgive Bat.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.250
Fine.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.666
Yeah, right.
Like that would happen.

20:08.833 --> 20:12.041
-Hello.
-Hey, it's Dale. Don't hang up.

20:12.125 --> 20:15.333
Look, I just got a call from the police
and Monty's been kidnapped.

20:15.416 --> 20:18.208
-What? Are you serious?
-Yeah, it's crazy.

20:18.291 --> 20:19.708
The cops want a statement from us

20:19.791 --> 20:21.250
since we were
the last people he talked to.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.500
I'm gonna head back
to his apartment.

20:22.583 --> 20:23.916
I'll meet you there, okay?

20:34.291 --> 20:38.000
-Chip, you're here.
-Of course. Come on.

20:48.250 --> 20:49.291
Poor Monty.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.041
Huh.

20:55.416 --> 20:59.333
Toad, take this to the lab.
You're the friends of the victim?

20:59.583 --> 21:02.625
You got anything for me?
Any known enemies or threats?

21:02.708 --> 21:06.333
Yeah, actually, Monty told me
he was in debt to the Valley Gang?

21:06.500 --> 21:09.333
He was afraid of being bootlegged
since he was somewhat of a star

21:09.458 --> 21:10.958
in the early '90s.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.333
He was on the Rescue Rangers.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.708
We were on the show together.

21:19.291 --> 21:21.458
Chip 'n Dale, Rescue Rangers?

21:22.458 --> 21:25.541
-When you need help, just call...
-Never heard of it.

21:25.666 --> 21:28.458
-What?
-This is my fault. I shouldn't have left.

21:28.541 --> 21:31.166
Well, it eats me up inside
to have to tell you this,

21:31.250 --> 21:35.416
but if he's been taken by the Valley Gang,
I doubt we can help you.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.166
We've been trying for years
to track those sleaze bags.

21:38.250 --> 21:40.375
A fella named Sweet Pete,
runs the whole operation,

21:40.458 --> 21:43.458
-and he's always one step ahead of us.
-What?

21:43.583 --> 21:45.458
So, that's it? I... I thought
that cops were supposed

21:45.541 --> 21:48.416
to serve and protect,
not give up and move on.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.250
Hey! I'd give anything
to make a case against those scum.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.791
Sweet Pete's got his fingers
in every illegal business

21:53.875 --> 21:55.875
from bootlegging to stinky cheese,

21:56.250 --> 21:59.458
getting rich while we look like
we just fell off the turnip truck.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.041
-All done, sir.

22:01.125 --> 22:04.041
Oh! You scared the beans out
of me, Steckler.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.208
Sorry, sir.

22:05.291 --> 22:10.125
-I searched the perimeter. No clues.
-Yeah, of course not. Why would there be?

22:10.333 --> 22:13.166
Six missing toons
in a month and not one clue.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.791
Well, maybe we should check in
with the neighbors?

22:14.875 --> 22:18.375
-See if anyone saw anything?
-Oh, yeah. You think?

22:18.458 --> 22:21.458
Why don't you just
leave the real detective work to me, okay?

22:21.541 --> 22:24.541
-Sheesh.
-Right. Sorry, sir.

22:24.708 --> 22:27.083
Chief, the press are outside
waiting for a statement.

22:27.166 --> 22:29.750
-Do I have anything on my back?
-- Yes, sir.

22:29.833 --> 22:33.166
It looks like a Monopoly game piece
and Officer O'Hara.

22:33.250 --> 22:37.791
Officer! What the... Ugh, just want one
day where my shirt stays clean.

22:38.083 --> 22:39.750
Okay, pack it up, boys.

22:40.708 --> 22:41.708
Let's go.

22:44.041 --> 22:45.583
Hey!

22:46.541 --> 22:51.291
-I'm Ellie Steckler. Uh. I am a huge fan.
-Really?

22:51.375 --> 22:54.000
I actually became a detective
because as a little girl

22:54.083 --> 22:56.916
growing up in Albany,
I wanted to help people.

22:57.166 --> 23:02.375
-Just like you guys.
-No way. We are so honored. Namaste.

23:02.458 --> 23:04.958
You know that was just
a TV show, right? Not real.

23:05.041 --> 23:07.583
Chip, inspiration is inspiration.

23:07.708 --> 23:10.333
Look, I heard
what Putty was saying to you guys.

23:10.416 --> 23:13.416
But I don't think it's hopeless.
I'm breaking some rules telling you this,

23:13.500 --> 23:15.666
but from everything
that we know about bootlegging,

23:15.750 --> 23:17.916
the whole process takes about two days.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.500
-That's 48 hours.
-Yeah.

23:20.583 --> 23:21.583
- The problem is,

23:21.666 --> 23:24.666
we don't know where
Sweet Pete's bootlegging facility is.

23:24.750 --> 23:28.333
And every time we try to get a warrant,
we get so bogged down in red tape

23:28.416 --> 23:29.708
that nothing happens.

23:29.791 --> 23:31.958
But if you guys can find
that bootlegging facility,

23:32.208 --> 23:33.708
I think you'll find your friend.

23:33.791 --> 23:37.166
Wow! Thank you, and thank you again
for watching the show.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.666
-It really means a lot.
-You are gross.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.916
-I'll be in touch.
-- You're amazing!

23:44.791 --> 23:45.833
Eh?

23:45.916 --> 23:47.291
-- What?
-You heard her.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.833
-We should go find Monty ourselves.
-Are you kidding?

23:49.916 --> 23:53.416
-No! Who better to rescue Monty?
-Uh, literally anyone.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.166
'Cause from where I am standing,
there's only one crime-fighting team

23:56.250 --> 23:58.541
that can solve this case.
I'll call Gadget and Zipper.

23:58.625 --> 24:01.666
No, don't bother them.
We're as much real detectives

24:01.750 --> 24:05.125
-as the Scooby-Doo gang.
-Exactly. That's why we have to try.

24:05.208 --> 24:06.500
No! What?

24:06.583 --> 24:08.625
Chip, Monty called
both of us looking for help

24:08.708 --> 24:10.666
and we let him down.
We can't just let him rot

24:10.750 --> 24:13.541
in some overseas studio,
being forced to make bad movies.

24:13.625 --> 24:17.375
If he's gonna make bad movies,
he should be making them here with me.

24:17.458 --> 24:19.791
Okay, even if we were
going to help,

24:19.875 --> 24:23.333
we have no idea where to start.
We don't even know what we're...

24:23.416 --> 24:25.791
Cheese.

24:26.583 --> 24:29.791
-Uh. Okay. Hey, listen.

24:29.875 --> 24:31.583
Buddy, If you're low
on cash or something,

24:31.666 --> 24:34.208
-I can buy you a nice, clean sandwich.
-Okay. Aha!

24:34.291 --> 24:36.875
Here it is! I threw this out
when I came over earlier.

24:36.958 --> 24:40.083
"Bjornson's Cheese Shop.
3344, Main Street."

24:40.166 --> 24:44.333
Um. Did you just find a clue?
You literally just sniffed out a clue!

24:44.458 --> 24:46.708
Look, we can go to the cheese shop.
See what we can find out

24:46.791 --> 24:48.625
about this secret facility
and Sweet Pete,

24:48.708 --> 24:51.666
then pass it along to the officer lady,
but that's all we're gonna do.

24:51.750 --> 24:54.000
So, you're saying
the Rescue Rangers are back?

24:54.083 --> 24:58.083
No, because there's no such thing
as Rescue Rangers. Case closed.

24:58.166 --> 25:00.125
-"Case?"
-No, this is not a case

25:00.208 --> 25:04.916
-because we're not real detectives.
-Oh ho ho! But you did say case. Yes!

25:18.958 --> 25:22.250
-Can I help you?
-Sorry.

25:22.333 --> 25:25.916
I'm just happy to see you.
Chip 'n Dale, together again.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.458
Yeah. Okay.

25:27.583 --> 25:30.625
Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!
Rescue Rangers

25:30.791 --> 25:32.833
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!
-Stop singing the song.

25:34.125 --> 25:36.916
You know they make
chipmunk-sized cars, right?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.875
Duh. But human stuff is the best.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.916
A little work done on her,
and she'll be back to her glory days.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.625
Hey, watch out!

25:45.291 --> 25:47.583
Do you know what a metaphor is, Dale?

25:47.791 --> 25:49.375
If you're about to say
this car is a metaphor

25:49.458 --> 25:50.916
for something about me, you can stop.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.625
Because, no,
I don't know what a metaphor is.

25:53.833 --> 25:55.500
Look, if we're gonna solve...

25:55.583 --> 25:57.333
-- "The Case of the Missing Monty."

25:57.541 --> 25:59.708
That's just a placeholder name.
Open to any ideas.

25:59.791 --> 26:03.583
-We're gonna have to work together.
-We are not working together.

26:03.666 --> 26:05.375
You're funny, Chip.

26:06.041 --> 26:09.708
-Ugh...

26:10.708 --> 26:13.375
- Okay, we're getting close.
Pull up over there.

26:17.916 --> 26:20.583
And leave the top hat
and cane in the car, please.

26:20.791 --> 26:23.250
Whoa! How did you know that?

26:23.500 --> 26:26.000
-'Cause you're you.
-All right. Heads-up.

26:26.291 --> 26:30.166
Well... ...there's no faster way
to gain someone's respect

26:30.250 --> 26:32.208
than to dress like
an important business magnet.

26:32.333 --> 26:34.708
You mean business "magnate"?

26:34.833 --> 26:38.958
Uh. I think I know my own character, Chip,
and he wears a top hat.

26:43.583 --> 26:47.875
- Ah, this place is pretty shady.
Are we sure it's safe?

26:47.958 --> 26:51.083
- No. Because nothing's safe...

26:54.416 --> 26:56.333
...on Main Street.

27:00.458 --> 27:04.458
Oh, wow. It seems kinda nice.
It's not what I pictured.

27:04.541 --> 27:08.083
Trust me, it's worse.
It's a bunch of cartoons trading

27:08.166 --> 27:10.750
on their wholesome public image
to keep the cops away.

27:10.833 --> 27:13.125
And bring you
the slimiest backwater bazaar

27:13.208 --> 27:15.958
of contraband this side of Guadalajara.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.541
You sure about that?
That dog's blowing bubbles.

27:19.041 --> 27:20.333
Hello!

27:20.541 --> 27:24.208
Nothing, and I mean nothing
is sacred in this part of town.

27:24.583 --> 27:26.208
Bread for sale, bread for sale

27:26.291 --> 27:29.083
-Everyone loves bread for sale
-That guy, he sells untraceable weapons.

27:29.208 --> 27:31.833
Scoot, scoot
A shiny shoe makes the man

27:32.083 --> 27:34.208
A shiny shoe, now there's a plan

27:34.416 --> 27:36.583
Stolen social security numbers.

27:36.708 --> 27:38.250
Roses are a way

27:38.333 --> 27:40.583
-To make a girl feel pretty...
-No, thanks, kid.

27:41.125 --> 27:44.041
-Muppet fights.
-Okay, why do you know all this?

27:44.125 --> 27:47.375
Well, sometimes when I'm low on cash,
I sell my fur to that wig shop.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.166
Hey. Far out.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.750
-It's a stinky, it's a gooey
-- Ah, here.

27:51.833 --> 27:53.500
-It's a stinky, it's a gooey...
-I think this is our guy.

27:53.708 --> 27:56.166
I make deals for a living.
So, just let me do the talking.

27:56.250 --> 27:59.125
-Ten-four. Got your back.
-No, you don't have my back. I got this.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.875
Hi, Mr. Bjornson.
Do you have any cheese for sale?

28:03.166 --> 28:05.125
Oh, do I have cheese?

28:05.250 --> 28:09.000
Let's see, we've got the Muenster,
the Gouda, the Brie.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.083
Do you have any "stinky cheese?"

28:13.333 --> 28:14.500
-Are you cops?

28:14.708 --> 28:18.583
No! No. We just wanna buy
some stinky cheese.

28:18.666 --> 28:20.458
The stinkier, the better.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.958
All right, come on. Get in.

28:34.541 --> 28:36.041
Oh, yeah.

28:36.125 --> 28:40.000
-Oh, so good.
-More, please. More, please.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.791
Choo! Choo!

28:42.875 --> 28:47.208
Hey, no more free samples, Lester.
This isn't Baskin Robbins.

28:47.666 --> 28:49.416
So, you want stinky cheese?

28:49.541 --> 28:52.458
I got smell lines that'll take you
through the ceiling.

28:53.458 --> 28:55.625
-Ow.

28:55.958 --> 28:59.833
"Through the ceiling," huh?
Seems like you offer a quality product.

28:59.916 --> 29:03.833
But hey, before we get into all that,
do me a favor. Take a look at this photo.

29:03.916 --> 29:06.416
It's a friend of mine named Monterey Jack.

29:06.541 --> 29:08.500
Which is also the name of a cheese.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.000
-Continue.
-Right.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.625
So, we think he's being held
in a warehouse somewhere.

29:14.708 --> 29:15.750
If you know anything,

29:15.833 --> 29:18.250
I'm sure we could make it
worth your while.

29:18.333 --> 29:23.041
Like, what would you say to some
complementary RV or boat insurance?

29:24.375 --> 29:29.083
Nah, I don't know nothin'.
Now, either buy some cheese or get out.

29:29.333 --> 29:30.875
Oh, okay. Um...

29:31.291 --> 29:35.208
Well, perhaps we should,
with the disrespectful tone

29:35.291 --> 29:37.875
this felted clodhopper takes,
why, I never!

29:38.041 --> 29:41.250
-What are you doing?
-I am an important business magnet.

29:41.333 --> 29:44.041
I shall have no trouble
attracting other suitors

29:44.125 --> 29:47.583
for my gigantic deal
because that's what magnets do.

29:47.791 --> 29:50.583
They attract business.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.083
No, you two are definitely cops.
You're out of here.

29:54.166 --> 29:56.500
Okay, hold on.
This is getting out of hand.

29:56.583 --> 30:00.583
-We are not cops.
-We're actors!

30:01.208 --> 30:04.083
It's been us, Chip 'n Dale,
the whole time.

30:04.625 --> 30:09.958
Huh. Interesting. My boss,
Sweet Pete, he loves actors.

30:10.041 --> 30:14.166
-Ah, yeah. Who doesn't?
-You know, I think you should meet him.

30:14.250 --> 30:16.875
Really? Meeting Sweet Pete, huh?

30:16.958 --> 30:21.000
Looks like I just took us
from outside the club to the VIP room.

30:24.416 --> 30:28.750
Wow! This VIP room is incredible!
I'm freaking out, dude.

30:28.833 --> 30:32.791
Is that Jessica Rabbit over there?
I'm only asking because I'm zip tied

30:32.875 --> 30:35.625
-in the back of a truck!
-Whoa! What's with the attitude?

30:35.708 --> 30:37.375
We were about to get
kicked out with your plan,

30:37.458 --> 30:40.166
and now, thanks to my sweet improv,
we're going to see Sweet Pete.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.333
Oh, you're insane.

30:41.416 --> 30:42.500
-Am I?
-Of course.

30:42.583 --> 30:43.750
-So, you'd rather just give up?
-No!

30:43.833 --> 30:45.916
-You wanna just wait around...
-You should've just let me take the lead!

30:49.500 --> 30:51.458
Hey! Hold on a second!

30:51.541 --> 30:54.541
How adorable are we?
Chemistry like this doesn't just happen.

30:54.625 --> 30:56.583
This has got reboot written all over it.

30:56.666 --> 30:59.958
Ugh. Are you serious?
I should be home right now.

31:00.041 --> 31:03.125
Millie is probably worried sick
and peeing all over the place.

31:03.208 --> 31:06.583
Oh, are you seeing someone?
She sounds... nice.

31:06.666 --> 31:10.625
-She's a dog. Millie is a dog.
-Ah, I'm sure she's not that bad.

31:10.708 --> 31:13.500
-What? No, she's...

31:20.416 --> 31:21.416
We're here.

31:25.375 --> 31:28.416
Whoa. This place looks weird.

31:29.125 --> 31:30.125
Where are we?

31:34.375 --> 31:35.791
- Okay.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.750
I think we're in the Valley.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.500
-The Uncanny Valley.
-The what?

31:40.875 --> 31:44.833
Do you remember that weird
animation style in the early 2000s

31:44.916 --> 31:48.041
where everything looked real,
but nothing looked right?

31:48.250 --> 31:50.166
Oh, yeah. That stuff was creepy.

31:50.250 --> 31:52.333
Well, I think this is where they ended up.

31:52.416 --> 31:55.625
- Come on. This way.

32:00.708 --> 32:03.166
-- What?
-I got something for Sweet Pete.

32:03.291 --> 32:06.541
-A little gift from Bjornson.
-- Okay, leave it there.

32:07.208 --> 32:09.000
Good luck, dummies.

32:09.416 --> 32:12.041
Blend, Cheese, Curd, Blend...

32:18.375 --> 32:22.708
-Who are you?
-Is he talking to us?

32:22.833 --> 32:26.750
I can't tell.
He's got those Polar Express eyes.

32:26.916 --> 32:32.500
-Uh. Are you talking to us?
-Obviously, I said, "Who are you?"

32:32.666 --> 32:35.083
Well, right. But in fairness,
it looks like you're talking

32:35.250 --> 32:37.625
-to that window.
-No, it actually looks like

32:37.708 --> 32:39.833
-I'm looking right at you.
-Okay.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.375
Look at my eyes,
looking right at your eyes.

32:42.666 --> 32:45.708
-Yeah.
-Okay. Listen, sir.

32:45.875 --> 32:48.375
Actually, you know what?
Get... Here, just...

32:48.458 --> 32:52.000
Get off me! Get your foot out of my mouth.

32:52.083 --> 32:56.041
Hey, there! Can you see me?
Hi! We just wanna talk to Sweet Pete.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.958
Okay, follow me!

33:10.291 --> 33:12.416
I wonder if they're keeping Monty in here.

33:12.708 --> 33:14.458
There's only one way to find out.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.750
So, is this your secret
bootlegging facility or what?

33:17.833 --> 33:20.750
-Come on!
-What? No! What are you talking about?

33:20.833 --> 33:22.875
This is Sweet Pete's legit business.

33:22.958 --> 33:25.041
It's for old merchandise
that never got sold.

33:25.125 --> 33:28.166
-Old merchandise?
-Yeah, like for example,

33:28.250 --> 33:30.500
-you remember Shrek body wash?
-- Uh...

33:30.583 --> 33:32.666
- Exactly. No one does. It didn't sell.

33:32.750 --> 33:35.458
That's why Sweet Pete
bought all the inventory,

33:35.583 --> 33:39.833
and melts it down for its useful parts.
The guy has a real eye for business.

33:39.958 --> 33:41.791
I wish I could see what he sees.

33:41.875 --> 33:45.583
I'm sure there's corrective lenses
or something you could get. Ow. What?

33:53.791 --> 33:58.500
So, he turns the toys into toy-lets.

33:58.625 --> 34:04.458
Wow! That's been staring at me for years,
and I never pieced it together.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.125
Here we are!

34:15.375 --> 34:16.375
Hello!

34:17.000 --> 34:18.333
-Peter Pan?
-- Yup!

34:18.625 --> 34:22.083
Star of stage and screen,
but you can call me Sweet Pete.

34:22.250 --> 34:26.166
-Oh, you look...
-Old? Bald? Sad like a zoo gorilla?

34:26.625 --> 34:30.583
-What? No. Not like a zoo gorilla.
-Don't worry.

34:30.666 --> 34:33.625
You can't say nothing to me
I haven't heard already. Jimmy, please.

34:33.708 --> 34:34.958
Untie our guests.

34:37.375 --> 34:40.666
Chip and Dale! Wow!
You mind if I walk while we talk?

34:40.833 --> 34:44.458
Not fitting into the old costume
like I used to. Need to get my steps in.

34:44.541 --> 34:46.375
Hey! I've got one of those.

34:46.458 --> 34:48.666
We should link accounts
and help motivate each other.

34:48.875 --> 34:53.375
Right. So, I'm guessing you two are here
to talk about Monterey Jack.

34:53.500 --> 34:57.583
-Oh. Yeah, actually we are.
-You know, I always liked Monty.

34:57.708 --> 35:01.625
It's a shame what happened.
Too much cheese. Not enough bread.

35:01.916 --> 35:04.000
Listen, Mr. Sweet Pete... Mr. Pete.

35:04.083 --> 35:06.625
We'd be willing to pay
whatever Monty owes you

35:06.708 --> 35:09.208
if you could give him a break?
Just this once?

35:09.458 --> 35:13.041
Hmm. "Give him a break"?
You know, I got my big break

35:13.125 --> 35:17.333
when I was just a kid. I got cast
in the biggest movie in the world,

35:17.416 --> 35:20.500
as the boy who wouldn't grow up,
Peter Pan.

35:20.666 --> 35:23.541
I'd never been so happy in my entire life.

35:23.625 --> 35:28.000
Then I got older,
and they threw me away like I was nothing.

35:28.125 --> 35:30.125
This business can be so tough

35:30.416 --> 35:31.750
You said it.

35:31.958 --> 35:35.500
I was scared, desperate, and all alone.

35:36.708 --> 35:41.875
So, I decided to take the power back
and make my own bootleg movie!

35:41.958 --> 35:44.916
I called it "Flying Bedroom Boy."

35:45.000 --> 35:48.083
And guess what? It worked!
I made lots of money.

35:48.166 --> 35:52.125
So, I recruited other toons,
to star in more movies

35:52.416 --> 35:56.208
and bang-a-rang, now I run
my own bootleg movie studio,

35:56.333 --> 36:00.916
where I get to decide who's a star,
and who gets thrown in the trash!

36:01.083 --> 36:04.583
And now, you two come
poking around where you don't belong,

36:04.791 --> 36:07.041
asking questions
about your missing friend.

36:07.208 --> 36:10.583
And I can't have that.
So, how's this for a break?

36:10.708 --> 36:14.208
I'm thinking it's time
for a Chip 'n Dale reboot.

36:14.291 --> 36:16.833
-Jimmy...
-You, come with me.

36:16.958 --> 36:18.166
-Yup, we're dead.
-Run!

36:19.666 --> 36:21.500
Go, go, go, go, go!

36:21.583 --> 36:25.625
-- Just grab them already!
-- I'm trying!

36:25.750 --> 36:28.750
Come on! Ready? Jump!

36:32.208 --> 36:33.583
Ah!

36:33.666 --> 36:35.416
- Hey!
That's my personal bathroom.

36:35.500 --> 36:36.708
Look for a way out of here!

36:36.791 --> 36:38.250
-- Hey!
-Uh... No.

36:38.333 --> 36:39.541
-- Come out here!
-No.

36:39.625 --> 36:43.458
-Aha! There's only one way, Chip.
-No! That's disgusting.

36:43.541 --> 36:44.833
- Jimmy, I got them!

36:44.916 --> 36:46.958
It's our only chance. Live a little!

36:47.041 --> 36:49.958
Live a little?
You seem excited about this!

36:50.041 --> 36:54.375
-Don't... No... Aw...
-Come on, Chip, the water's fine!

36:55.250 --> 36:57.416
-Aw. Dang it!
-- Come on! No!

36:57.500 --> 36:58.541
O... okay.

36:58.625 --> 36:59.958
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

37:00.041 --> 37:01.666
-Happy birth...

37:01.833 --> 37:05.166
No, no! I'm done.

37:05.416 --> 37:07.833
You better pray
they don't make it out of there alive.

37:16.375 --> 37:19.250
-- Whoa! No! No!
-- Whoa! Hold on!

37:20.291 --> 37:21.416
- Watch out!

37:21.500 --> 37:23.250
-- Hate this! Hate this!
-- Oh, God!

37:26.208 --> 37:28.958
-I should probably get this!
-What?

37:29.041 --> 37:33.541
-It could be my agent, Dave Bolinari!
-Oh, cool! Let me know what he says!

37:33.791 --> 37:36.875
Hello! What? Oh, yeah, spaghetti's fine!

37:36.958 --> 37:40.750
Love you too, Mom!
My agent is so weird.

37:42.958 --> 37:44.875
- Try to grab something!

37:46.291 --> 37:48.791
-Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull!
-No! No!

37:55.958 --> 37:57.916
There! The paddleball!

37:58.916 --> 38:01.625
-Ready? Jump!

38:01.708 --> 38:04.208
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

38:04.291 --> 38:05.791
Hold on!

38:05.875 --> 38:09.916
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

38:28.208 --> 38:30.250
Dale? Hello?

38:31.541 --> 38:34.541
Dale?

38:34.708 --> 38:36.958
Oh, no. Dale?

38:37.541 --> 38:40.375
Come on, don't, uh,
don't prank me like this.

38:47.375 --> 38:49.833
-I should've...
-What's up?

38:50.125 --> 38:51.291
Not now, Dale.

38:51.583 --> 38:56.916
Dale! You're alive! But how?

38:58.125 --> 39:00.250
The name's Munk. Dale Munk.

39:00.666 --> 39:03.750
-Ugh. Double-0 Dale, of course.

39:03.958 --> 39:07.750
Chip, you were crying.
You really do love me!

39:07.916 --> 39:10.375
-What? No! I... You were crying!
-Aw!

39:10.458 --> 39:12.333
-Can we...
-Chippy, Chippy, I love you too!

39:12.458 --> 39:14.791
Don't make it about you.
I was traumatized!

39:14.916 --> 39:16.000
-Aw.
-Just leave it alone, okay?

39:16.083 --> 39:20.458
Okay, fine. Well, that whole day
was a big waste!

39:20.583 --> 39:22.583
We didn't learn anything
of value except for that

39:22.666 --> 39:24.916
Sweet Pete wears
the same step tracker that I do.

39:25.208 --> 39:28.791
Wait, those step trackers,
do they keep track of everywhere you go?

39:28.875 --> 39:31.875
Yeah, I know because I like
to map my runs in the shape of a butt.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.583
-I can't believe I'm saying this,

39:33.666 --> 39:35.291
but we need to go talk to Ellie.

39:35.416 --> 39:36.833
And then, I'm going home!

39:36.916 --> 39:39.666
- Okay, but please just don't tell her
about the butt thing.

39:39.750 --> 39:42.041
-- I can't promise that.

39:42.125 --> 39:43.708
Do you think she'll think
it's funny, though?

39:48.875 --> 39:49.875
Thanks!

39:51.125 --> 39:54.000
So, if we could get ahold
of Sweet Pete's step tracker,

39:54.083 --> 39:57.250
we could cross reference where he's been,
with where we know he goes!

39:57.333 --> 40:00.958
Right! And whatever doesn't overlap
has got to be his secret facility!

40:01.041 --> 40:04.708
Exactly! We get the step tracker,
and we can trace it to find Monty.

40:04.791 --> 40:08.083
-Chip, you're a genius!
-So, what's the plan?

40:08.166 --> 40:10.166
How are you guys gonna get
Sweet Pete's step tracker?

40:10.250 --> 40:12.875
"You guys"? Hold on.
We got you the info you needed.

40:12.958 --> 40:17.125
Now, it's up to you, the professional,
to actually, you know, get the bad guy,

40:17.208 --> 40:19.875
-and save our friend Monty?
-It's not as simple as that.

40:19.958 --> 40:23.875
We need warrants, we need probable cause,
and I don't know if you guys noticed,

40:23.958 --> 40:26.791
but the captain doesn't really
value my opinion too much.

40:26.875 --> 40:31.625
-What? He's crazy!
-No, I really screwed up.

40:32.708 --> 40:35.000
Last year, when Peppa Pig went missing,

40:35.083 --> 40:38.541
I fell for a bogus tip,
and made the whole squad

40:38.625 --> 40:40.541
raid Nickelodeon Junior Studios.

40:41.708 --> 40:43.583
And the toons fought back.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.625
Paw Patrol attacked Sergeant Henderson.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.916
The doctors say he'll never have kids.

40:51.875 --> 40:55.833
Huh, thank you for sharing
that absolutely bonkers story.

40:55.916 --> 40:59.125
I think I have exactly
what we need! Don't move.

40:59.666 --> 41:04.250
Ladies and gentlemen.
Behold! The crime lab!

41:22.375 --> 41:27.833
What? This is crazy.

41:28.208 --> 41:31.916
Pretty sweet, right? All the disguises
and gadgets we could ever need.

41:33.041 --> 41:37.291
Wait, is this like every episode
of Rescue Rangers ever?

41:37.375 --> 41:40.166
-Yes, it is.
-You've got them all.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.625
"Catteries Not Included."

41:41.708 --> 41:44.416
"Throw Mummy from the Train,"
"Dirty Rotten Diapers."

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
Okay, so what's your favorite episode?

41:46.583 --> 41:49.041
Ooh, I... I can't pick one.
That's too hard!

41:55.125 --> 41:57.500
I'm honestly surprised
you kept all this stuff.

41:57.833 --> 42:00.208
I didn't think you cared
about the show back then.

42:00.291 --> 42:01.916
What? Of course I did.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.250
No. Yeah, of course.

42:05.291 --> 42:07.541
What's this huge map
with all the pins in it?

42:07.625 --> 42:09.625
Oh, that? It's actually very cool.

42:09.750 --> 42:12.416
Oh, no. Is this where
all the victims are buried?

42:12.541 --> 42:14.708
You're messing with me again!

42:14.791 --> 42:18.666
It actually shows Rescue Rangers' ratings
in every US market in 1991

42:18.750 --> 42:21.541
which, as you may recall,
was our most successful year.

42:21.708 --> 42:23.958
Hey, Ellie, didn't you say
you were from Albany?

42:24.041 --> 42:25.166
Born and raised.

42:25.291 --> 42:28.750
Well, according to this map
Rescue Rangers never aired in Albany.

42:28.833 --> 42:32.875
Yeah! My grandma, she used to tape
all the episodes and send them to me.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.583
-Hmm.
-Grandmas rule!

42:35.708 --> 42:37.500
Oh, come on, Chip!
Look at all this cool stuff!

42:37.625 --> 42:41.250
Like this is the limited edition
Rescue Rangers pog set!

42:41.500 --> 42:43.000
You know, this turned
into a real collectible,

42:43.083 --> 42:44.791
because someone noticed
that one of the clouds

42:44.875 --> 42:47.875
behind Monterey Jack
looked exactly like... Oprah.

42:47.958 --> 42:49.875
Wow. So cool.

42:49.958 --> 42:53.791
I know, right?
Unfortunately, I only have 11 of the 12.

42:53.875 --> 42:56.041
I'm missing the main one
of all of us together.

42:56.125 --> 42:58.083
Ah, it's just old junk.

42:58.250 --> 43:01.833
Okay, guys. Sweet Pete goes
to the Russian bathhouse every Wednesday.

43:01.958 --> 43:03.750
So, how are we gonna
sneak you guys in there

43:03.833 --> 43:05.875
without being recognized
by all those goons?

43:06.291 --> 43:09.958
-Wait. What if we did episode 45?
-Forty-five?

43:10.791 --> 43:13.541
-That's a good idea.
-No idea what you're referring to.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.375
And do you have any original ideas?

43:15.458 --> 43:17.791
Or are you just
constantly recycling old scripts?

43:17.916 --> 43:21.125
Oh, come on! Episode 45!
You dressed up like a rat to fool me.

43:21.250 --> 43:23.750
You don't remember?
You said, "Rats what I'm talking about."

43:23.833 --> 43:25.083
It was hilarious!

43:25.291 --> 43:27.791
Oh... Nope, no clue.

43:27.916 --> 43:30.458
Ellie, if we do this,
we could really use your help.

43:30.541 --> 43:34.041
Um. I don't know.
I shouldn't even be here.

43:34.125 --> 43:39.375
Please!
I need you, Ellie! Help find me!

43:40.291 --> 43:43.833
-Okay, but just this once.
-Oh, thanks, love!

43:43.916 --> 43:45.666
Throw another shrimp on the barbie!

43:45.750 --> 43:48.333
-Stop.
-No, I know, that's why I stopped, yeah?

43:56.583 --> 44:00.166
- Okay, guys, remember,
you're plumbers here to fix a leaky pipe.

44:00.250 --> 44:02.000
Roger that. This thing working?

44:02.166 --> 44:04.166
- It' s working.
I'd say we have about an hour

44:04.291 --> 44:07.916
before anyone notices
this van is missing, so shake a tail.

44:08.125 --> 44:09.916
- I can't believe we're doing this.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.541
Please, just don't do
your bad New York accent.

44:12.625 --> 44:14.625
Chip, I hear you,
but it's an unreasonable ask.

44:14.791 --> 44:16.875
Yo! We're here to clean the pipes,

44:17.041 --> 44:19.083
or did you forget about it?

44:22.750 --> 44:26.291
Go Yanks! And hot dogs,
bagels, and pizza!

44:30.208 --> 44:32.875
Wow. I am honestly amazed
that that worked.

44:32.958 --> 44:35.875
Me too! That accent actually got me fired
from Law and Order.

44:35.958 --> 44:39.083
-Ellie, we're in.
-Good. Now, keep a low profile,

44:39.166 --> 44:40.791
and go find Sweet Pete's locker.

44:43.458 --> 44:44.541
- Hey, you two!

44:45.916 --> 44:47.208
This water fountain good?

44:47.291 --> 44:48.958
-Uh...
-Uh...

44:49.208 --> 44:50.875
Are the pipes clean to drink from?

44:50.958 --> 44:55.250
-Oh, um...
-Hey! They're cleaner than Broadway, baby.

44:55.333 --> 44:58.541
-I'm walking here.
-Good. Thank you.

45:04.541 --> 45:05.750
Hmm?

45:05.833 --> 45:09.250
- Nice work. You need to stay up
on those pipes, out of sight.

45:09.333 --> 45:10.333
Yup! On it.

45:11.416 --> 45:13.916
Oh, yeah! That feels great, man.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.291
-- Gross!
-- Nope. Come on.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.708
I get the kids on the weekends,
but it's not the same.

45:27.291 --> 45:29.208
- Whoa. It's him.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.083
- There it is.

45:44.500 --> 45:46.083
Okay, not great.

45:50.250 --> 45:54.125
Hey, I know you.

45:54.208 --> 45:55.583
-Oh, no.
-We're cooked.

45:56.250 --> 45:59.375
You're the Rescue Rangers.

46:01.416 --> 46:05.750
-I am huge fanboy!
-Oh, cool.

46:10.833 --> 46:13.416
Don't you just
hate awkward silences?

46:13.500 --> 46:16.666
Well, to be honest, it wasn't awkward
until you said that, Jimmy,

46:16.750 --> 46:18.833
and now it is, so great job.

46:18.916 --> 46:21.833
-- I guess that's true.
-Guys, come on!

46:22.875 --> 46:24.708
-Step right up and come on in
-You are recognizing?

46:24.791 --> 46:26.541
-Here's where the fun begins
-Yes? Wait for it.

46:26.875 --> 46:30.458
No way! Is this a remix
of the Disney Afternoon theme song?

46:30.541 --> 46:32.625
-You made this?
-You are knowing it, brother!

46:32.708 --> 46:34.250
Now you do a rap on it? Yes?

46:34.333 --> 46:37.291
Uh-oh, I don't know!
Give me one second with Dale here, bro.

46:37.375 --> 46:39.333
-First off, stop encouraging this guy.
-Totally.

46:39.416 --> 46:41.291
-Second, we are not rapping.
-Right.

46:41.375 --> 46:43.875
There is nothing more pathetic
than an old cartoon character

46:43.958 --> 46:46.375
-trying to seem cool again by rapping!
-Chip, I hear you,

46:46.458 --> 46:47.708
but I don't think
we have much of a choice!

46:47.791 --> 46:49.708
Oh, there's a choice.
When it comes to rapping,

46:49.791 --> 46:51.000
there's always a choice.

46:51.083 --> 46:52.625
Actually, can you just hold
that thought for one second?

46:52.708 --> 46:53.750
-Here I go!
-Oh, geez!

46:53.833 --> 46:55.666
My name is Dale...

46:55.958 --> 46:57.416
Uh...

46:57.500 --> 46:58.500
I'm about to kick it

46:58.666 --> 47:00.541
-Oh, no.
-And I'm in hell.

47:00.625 --> 47:02.666
Oh, wow, hold on. I need to film this!

47:02.750 --> 47:04.541
I'll distract him.
You get that step tracker.

47:04.625 --> 47:06.916
-It won't work. It's too risky.
-Well, the biggest risk

47:07.000 --> 47:09.750
is not taking any risk at all. Uh!

47:09.833 --> 47:14.208
My name is Dale, I don't eat whale
Why would you say, that I eat whale

47:14.291 --> 47:15.500
I don't eat whale

47:15.625 --> 47:18.541
Once you rhyme Dale with whale,
you can't think of anything else.

47:18.750 --> 47:22.250
-Just devour him! Make it stop!
-Not me, no, I would just eat the tail

47:22.333 --> 47:23.458
Hmm.

47:29.333 --> 47:32.125
I would never in a million years
Eat whale

47:32.208 --> 47:34.166
First of all, they're endangered

47:35.375 --> 47:38.041
-So, you gotta take care of the whale
-Macadamias. And where there's nuts,

47:38.125 --> 47:40.583
-there's oil.
-Don't want PETA on your tail

47:40.666 --> 47:42.583
But if I did eat whale
It wouldn't be stale

47:42.708 --> 47:44.833
-Aha.
-- Oh, man, I'm killing this!

47:44.958 --> 47:49.333
-And what are you doing?
-Oh, I was a just, uh...

47:49.416 --> 47:51.208
Aye, yo, Chip! Take the mic!

47:54.666 --> 47:56.416
Uh...

47:57.375 --> 47:58.625
For Monty.

47:58.791 --> 48:02.041
Well, my name is Chip, I'm not a whale

48:02.125 --> 48:04.041
And now I'm doing it, great.

48:04.416 --> 48:07.083
A zubi-zong, zubi, zubi, zubi, dong, dong

48:07.208 --> 48:08.916
-Yoink.
-Zubi, dong, dong, dong

48:09.291 --> 48:11.000
-'Cause he's Chip
-He's Dale

48:11.083 --> 48:12.083
And we'll never fail!

48:12.166 --> 48:14.250
'Cause neither of us
Will ever eat whale

48:14.375 --> 48:15.375
-No, never
-Ever

48:15.500 --> 48:16.500
-Never
-Ever

48:16.583 --> 48:17.666
-Never eat whale
-Eat whale

48:17.750 --> 48:19.625
Okay, what? How did you know
what I was gonna say?

48:19.708 --> 48:21.666
How did you know
what I was gonna say? It was like,

48:21.750 --> 48:22.750
-professional.
-Professional.

48:22.833 --> 48:24.250
-Same time!
-Same time!

48:24.333 --> 48:25.500
-Jinx!
-Jinx!

48:25.583 --> 48:27.541
-You owe me a non-brand specific cola!
-You owe me a non-brand specific cola!

48:27.625 --> 48:29.250
-What? That was crazy!
-What? That was crazy!

48:29.333 --> 48:31.541
-Somebody call Guinness book!
-Somebody call Guinness book!

48:31.708 --> 48:34.375
-This is incredible!
-This is blowing my mind!

48:34.458 --> 48:35.541
-We lost it.

48:35.708 --> 48:40.833
Boom, boom. It's DJ Herzogenaurach
with the Disney Afternoon remix!

48:40.916 --> 48:44.625
Hey, this was really fun,
but we actually got to get going!

48:44.833 --> 48:47.416
Ooh, they were very bad at rapping.

48:48.041 --> 48:51.166
Oh, hey, Bob! You are never going
to believe who I just met.

48:53.666 --> 48:55.458
Oh, man, Ellie, you should have seen us!

48:55.625 --> 48:56.791
-That was incredible!
-- Right?

48:57.166 --> 48:58.500
We were just like real detectives!

48:58.625 --> 49:01.208
And that match trick
you did with the oil? Genius!

49:01.291 --> 49:04.750
Yeah, but your bad rapping
was the perfect distraction. So good!

49:04.833 --> 49:08.208
Thanks. I totally thought we were busted.
But then you just fully went for it!

49:08.291 --> 49:11.666
-And then I rapped. What a rush!
-You were crazy!

49:11.750 --> 49:14.750
Okay, we are all set here.
Just plug that step tracker

49:14.833 --> 49:16.500
-into the computer.
-On it!

49:20.500 --> 49:23.708
Oh, San Pedro docks! Yes, we got him!

49:23.791 --> 49:26.500
I can't believe it.
We might actually get Monty back.

49:26.625 --> 49:30.541
-We're gonna be heroes.
-I gotta thank you for making me do this.

49:30.625 --> 49:36.416
-I mean, this feels... I feel... good.
-Me too! We were always better together.

49:36.958 --> 49:39.625
- Location confirmed.
We're sending SWAT now by chopper.

49:39.750 --> 49:41.333
-Meet us there.
-Yes, sir.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Here, Captain.

49:56.083 --> 49:58.458
I ought to suspend you
for going behind my back, Steckler.

49:58.541 --> 50:01.166
And I hope we don't get attacked
by the Rugrats this time.

50:02.458 --> 50:03.958
Ready the battering rams!

50:04.500 --> 50:07.041
-Let's go! Move! Move! Move!

50:17.208 --> 50:19.291
-- Clear!
-- Clear!

50:21.250 --> 50:22.291
- Clear!

50:23.083 --> 50:26.125
-Where do you think he is?
-I have no idea.

50:34.541 --> 50:35.541
- Sir!

50:36.958 --> 50:38.500
I think I found something.

50:43.416 --> 50:46.083
Careful. Don't touch anything.

50:59.041 --> 51:00.041
Flounder?

51:02.166 --> 51:03.166
Sneezy?

51:04.833 --> 51:06.125
They're all here.

51:06.708 --> 51:10.791
Whoa. Garfield's little body
can't take muscles like that.

51:11.458 --> 51:12.625
We found 'em.

51:15.125 --> 51:18.041
This looks like the machine
I had my CG work done on.

51:19.041 --> 51:22.125
Except, way more violent-looking.

51:23.875 --> 51:27.666
It's still warm.
Must have just missed him.

51:28.208 --> 51:30.291
Yeah, this place is creepy.

51:30.375 --> 51:32.541
- I'm gonna see
if I can't find a light switch.

51:32.625 --> 51:35.375
Wait. No, no, no, no,
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't!

51:39.750 --> 51:42.166
-See? Nothing to worry about!
-Heh. I guess you're right.

51:43.958 --> 51:45.958
-Uh. That's not good.

51:46.041 --> 51:48.458
-Dude! What did you do?
-I didn't mean to,

51:48.583 --> 51:50.958
I just... I put my leg back, my toe...

51:51.041 --> 51:52.916
-- Chip!
-- Why is it on the floor?

51:53.000 --> 51:54.041
Dale!

51:54.833 --> 51:56.916
-- Ah, no! Watch out!
-- Get out of there!

51:57.000 --> 51:58.833
- No, no, no, no, no!

52:04.416 --> 52:06.250
Help! Get us out of here!

52:08.333 --> 52:10.916
- The machine is gonna try
and surgically re-edit you,

52:11.000 --> 52:12.666
so, try to avoid that.

52:12.958 --> 52:15.583
Goodbye, Ellie! Always remember me!

52:15.666 --> 52:18.291
If we don't make it out of here alive,
let Millie live with you,

52:18.375 --> 52:20.083
and sleep on your bed,
and eat your food,

52:20.166 --> 52:22.250
and don't be afraid
to really scratch that butt!

52:28.250 --> 52:31.166
Are we about
to get waffle fried?

52:31.250 --> 52:32.583
No, I think it's...

52:32.666 --> 52:34.583
Scanning them,
and rendering what they'll look like

52:34.666 --> 52:36.375
in different animation styles.

52:42.333 --> 52:46.208
Okay. That was nothing.
You know, this might be easier than...

52:46.291 --> 52:47.500
-- Dale!

52:47.583 --> 52:50.458
-Hey! Hey!
-Hold on!

52:53.041 --> 52:56.041
-Pull harder!
-Why... won't... you... stretch?

52:56.125 --> 52:58.916
This body is meant
to be looked at, not touched!

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
-What are you doing?

53:04.583 --> 53:06.250
Whoa!

53:06.333 --> 53:07.958
-Thank you.
-Come on!

53:10.458 --> 53:11.666
- Whoa.

53:12.666 --> 53:15.875
-It's like episode 121!
-"Mission Chipossible!"

53:15.958 --> 53:17.833
-You're right.
-Wait, you remember?

53:17.916 --> 53:19.875
I guess a couple things
are coming back to me.

53:19.958 --> 53:21.916
Then let's do it.
How different could it be?

53:22.000 --> 53:25.083
-Very different! It can be very different.
-Ready?

53:25.458 --> 53:27.041
Jump! Duck!

53:28.041 --> 53:30.416
Pancake. Launch me!

53:35.416 --> 53:38.625
-Heads-up!
-Got you!

53:38.708 --> 53:40.708
-Slide!

53:43.875 --> 53:49.208
-You okay? Are you in one piece?
-Yeah, I think so. But you're not.

53:49.291 --> 53:50.291
Huh?

53:55.250 --> 53:57.250
I'm sure they're fine.

53:57.333 --> 53:59.541
-You got a Snoopy ear!
-Get it off! Get it off!

54:02.083 --> 54:04.000
The door! Let's get out of here!

54:15.541 --> 54:19.166
-What the...

54:26.291 --> 54:27.583
You guys okay?

54:33.333 --> 54:34.750
Look at all these parts.

54:36.333 --> 54:37.541
Oh, no.

54:38.916 --> 54:43.375
-Monty's mustache.
-No!

54:44.958 --> 54:46.791
He's been bootlegged!

55:00.000 --> 55:01.166
Hey, Steckler.

55:01.916 --> 55:04.625
Nice work, today.
I didn't think you had it in you.

55:05.541 --> 55:06.583
Thank you, sir.

55:07.875 --> 55:09.333
- Over here.
One question! Over here!

55:09.416 --> 55:12.291
3D In Your Face News.
With this factory shut down,

55:12.375 --> 55:15.041
how does it feel
to have made the city safer for toons?

55:15.125 --> 55:17.208
All right, come on.
Leave them alone. No questions.

55:17.291 --> 55:19.166
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.

55:19.250 --> 55:20.708
Hey, Chip, why the Snoopy ear?

55:20.791 --> 55:22.916
Captain Putty! Captain Putty!
Black and White News.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.833
Why is there a wad
of chewing gum on your back?

55:24.916 --> 55:26.708
Oh, come on! Gross.

55:26.791 --> 55:29.208
Now, that's just gonna be
a part of me forever.

55:30.958 --> 55:32.666
- Well, this is a mess.

55:32.875 --> 55:34.833
- We should probably skip down
for a while, huh, boss?

55:34.916 --> 55:37.333
We're not going anywhere without
those chipmunks.

55:37.458 --> 55:40.458
-I still want my reboot.
-Should we try to follow them?

55:40.583 --> 55:45.791
Nah, let 'em go. I have
my own special way of tracking people.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.458
-Are we sure that every room was checked?
-Yeah. Positive.

56:05.625 --> 56:09.375
You said bootlegging takes 48 hours.
We made it before then.

56:09.625 --> 56:13.916
-I know. It usually does.
-And that coffee was still warm.

56:14.041 --> 56:15.791
It's like they knew we were coming.

56:15.875 --> 56:18.791
Look, I know you guys are sad
about Monty,

56:18.875 --> 56:22.166
but you should still feel really good
about what you did back there.

56:22.375 --> 56:26.750
-You guys are heroes.
-We are not heroes. Monty's gone.

56:26.833 --> 56:29.250
I was so excited
to see his big, dopey face.

56:36.166 --> 56:39.583
I'm telling you,
we're missing something.

56:39.666 --> 56:41.000
I can feel it, Dale.

56:41.083 --> 56:44.916
Hey, just wanna remind you guys,
I'll be at Fan Con this afternoon,

56:45.000 --> 56:48.208
signing autographs.
So, get those nuts ready!

56:49.041 --> 56:50.958
-Yeah...
-What is wrong with you?

56:51.041 --> 56:52.416
What? It's my job.

56:52.500 --> 56:55.750
It's a choice.
I'm getting some coffee.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.375
Wh... Come on! I have
to stay connected to the fans!

56:59.500 --> 57:03.041
There are no fans.
It's for you. It's always for you,

57:03.208 --> 57:05.125
to feed your selfish ego.

57:05.708 --> 57:08.375
I thought you had changed,
but you haven't changed

57:08.458 --> 57:09.916
since Double-0 Dale!

57:10.375 --> 57:12.958
Wait, so you are still mad
about Double-0 Dale?

57:13.041 --> 57:14.500
I thought everything was artichokie.

57:14.666 --> 57:18.708
You left, Dale. You left me high and dry.
After everything we'd been through,

57:18.791 --> 57:20.458
everything I did for you!

57:21.041 --> 57:24.041
-So, we're not artichokie?
-No artichokie!

57:24.125 --> 57:28.625
Nothing's ever been artichokie.
Okay? I'm alone. I sell insurance.

57:28.708 --> 57:30.708
My only friend is a dog!

57:30.833 --> 57:33.291
Okay, but then
why did you say it was artichokie?

57:33.375 --> 57:34.916
I mean, when someone tells me
something's artichokie,

57:35.000 --> 57:36.291
I believe it's artichokie.

57:36.416 --> 57:40.041
Stop saying artichokie!
What is it, man?

57:40.208 --> 57:45.000
Oh, uh, if you could just scooch a bit,
from the coffee?

57:45.291 --> 57:48.083
Yes, yes, of course. Sorry.

57:48.166 --> 57:51.916
See? This is why
I didn't wanna see you anymore.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.333
Sure, my life is lonely,
but at least I didn't feel like this!

57:55.500 --> 57:58.708
Oh, yeah? Well, you're the same too!
Chip's always in charge!

57:58.791 --> 58:01.166
Chip's always right!
It's Chip's way or the highway!

58:01.416 --> 58:04.666
You know what? Here.
I've been holding on to this

58:04.750 --> 58:08.875
for some stupid reason.
Now, your collection is complete.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.458
- What?

58:14.791 --> 58:15.791
You kept this?

58:18.416 --> 58:21.625
You know the crazy thing is,
way back then...

58:22.458 --> 58:24.166
I didn't even wanna do Double-0 Dale.

58:24.875 --> 58:28.166
-What?
-It's gonna sound stupid, but...

58:28.291 --> 58:31.333
...I think I just wanted you
to tell me you needed me.

58:31.416 --> 58:35.000
That I wasn't just some pathetic chipmunk
you found eating alone at school.

58:36.541 --> 58:40.250
You know, I wanted this pog
for some silly reason, but now I don't.

58:40.333 --> 58:43.625
-Here, now your collection's complete.
-What? Don't give me that!

58:43.708 --> 58:45.833
That's the exact same thing
I just said to you.

58:45.958 --> 58:47.666
What? No, it's not.
I said, "silly reason."

58:47.750 --> 58:49.958
-You said, "stupid reason."
-Well, I don't want it.

58:50.041 --> 58:51.250
-Neither do I!
-Good!

58:51.333 --> 58:52.666
-I'm putting it on the ground.
-Great!

58:52.750 --> 58:53.750
-Yeah.
-Cool.

58:53.833 --> 58:54.875
-I know.
-Neat!

58:54.958 --> 58:56.500
It is neat. Thanks.

58:59.333 --> 59:01.875
Do you smell that?

59:02.166 --> 59:05.250
I'm definitely not falling
for one of your dumb fart jokes right now.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.875
-No! No, no! Smell!

59:07.958 --> 59:09.708
This whole place, it smells like...

59:10.458 --> 59:12.625
-almond butter and gasoline.
-Almond butter and gasoline.

59:12.708 --> 59:14.750
But that's the Rescue Rangers cologne.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.458
This way.

59:27.916 --> 59:30.333
It's coming from in here.

59:34.500 --> 59:37.291
- Why would Putty's office
smell like that?

59:37.833 --> 59:41.333
Dale, we need to leave, now.

59:41.750 --> 59:43.583
What's going on? Why are we running away?

59:43.666 --> 59:45.458
I'm not sure, but you
and your big red nose

59:45.541 --> 59:48.333
are onto something.
Monty was literally the only person

59:48.416 --> 59:51.291
-to ever use that disgusting cologne.
-Actually, I heard it's still used

59:51.375 --> 59:52.958
in the Latvia to strip paint,
but of course,

59:53.041 --> 59:54.791
we never see a dime of that.

59:54.916 --> 59:57.291
That's not the point.
Putty's office stunk of it,

59:57.375 --> 1:00:00.000
which means someone had
direct contact with Monty.

1:00:00.083 --> 1:00:02.166
-Oh, I knew Putty was dirty!
-Oh, you're just saying that

1:00:02.250 --> 1:00:04.458
'cause it's always the police captain
in our episodes.

1:00:04.541 --> 1:00:06.875
Putty's too obvious! Think, Dale!

1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:08.708
-Ellie?
-Something has been off about her

1:00:08.791 --> 1:00:09.916
the whole time!

1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.208
Claiming to be a huge fan
just to butter us up.

1:00:12.291 --> 1:00:14.125
She couldn't even name
her favorite episode.

1:00:14.208 --> 1:00:17.208
-'Cause she loves them all.
-No! 'Cause she's never seen any episodes!

1:00:17.458 --> 1:00:19.916
"Her grandmother
taped the show for her." Get real!

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.625
Grandparents are terrible at electronics.
That's their whole thing!

1:00:22.708 --> 1:00:25.500
-Aha! Speak of the devil!

1:00:25.625 --> 1:00:28.500
Are you crazy? Don't pick that up!
We don't know who we can trust.

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:31.875
We need outside help,
like the governor, the CIA, the FBI.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.041
I know someone
who might be able to help.

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:39.750
You got a Snoopy ear!

1:00:39.833 --> 1:00:43.583
Yes, Ugly Sonic, his ear is hilarious,
but do you have a contact at the FBI?

1:00:43.666 --> 1:00:46.500
Because we have some highly dangerous
and classified information for them.

1:00:46.666 --> 1:00:49.041
Yeah, of course.
I know tons of people at the FBI.

1:00:49.125 --> 1:00:52.125
-I'm making a TV show with them.
-Look, we really need your help,

1:00:52.208 --> 1:00:53.708
but we don't have a lot of time.

1:00:53.791 --> 1:00:57.458
Oh, you want me to go fast?
That's Sonic's thing.

1:00:57.791 --> 1:01:04.708
Ugly Sonic goes slow, baby.

1:01:05.333 --> 1:01:07.041
-So, you're not gonna help us?
-No, I'm not.

1:01:07.166 --> 1:01:10.208
Ugh! You don't have a show with the FBI.
I knew it! I knew it!

1:01:10.291 --> 1:01:11.416
- I wasn't finished.

1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:13.375
-Dale, we need to go.
-- I'll run it by my producer later

1:01:13.458 --> 1:01:15.083
-when I see him at the Chateau.
-- Oh, no.

1:01:15.166 --> 1:01:18.500
-Quick, we'll lose them in the crowd.
-- One day, you'll see, Dale.

1:01:18.666 --> 1:01:21.833
You'll turn on your television
and all will be revealed.

1:01:21.916 --> 1:01:24.125
-No, it won't.
-Yes, it will!

1:01:24.208 --> 1:01:26.250
Move!

1:01:26.458 --> 1:01:29.750
Out of the way! Move it, nerds!

1:01:29.875 --> 1:01:32.333
You know, originally,
it was called Aunt Man,

1:01:32.500 --> 1:01:36.708
A-U-N-T, and my superpower
was being really charming to aunts.

1:01:36.791 --> 1:01:39.958
That's great, isn't it?

1:01:40.041 --> 1:01:41.458
-Yeah, they changed it...
-Whoa! Coming through.

1:01:41.541 --> 1:01:42.833
Love your work!

1:01:42.916 --> 1:01:44.125
-Whoa!
-Watch out!

1:01:44.208 --> 1:01:46.125
-Okay. Nice horsey, nice horsey.
-Whoa!

1:01:46.416 --> 1:01:48.625
-Step aside. Move.

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:54.750
-There they are.
-Well, go get them.

1:02:01.875 --> 1:02:04.791
-Gotcha!
-Oh, what?

1:02:04.958 --> 1:02:10.958
-Peter, is that really you? You got old.
-Yeah, death is coming for us all, kid.

1:02:12.333 --> 1:02:15.416
-How do they know we're here?
-I'm guessing your social media post

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:16.791
at the police station.

1:02:16.875 --> 1:02:18.791
Ah! Oops.

1:02:18.916 --> 1:02:21.833
-Yeah, that's my bad.
-Hey, there's something down there.

1:02:21.958 --> 1:02:23.916
There's nothing down there, you boob.

1:02:24.166 --> 1:02:27.916
You walk around with no pants long enough,
and you start to notice every breeze.

1:02:28.041 --> 1:02:29.708
-Gotcha! Huh?

1:02:30.875 --> 1:02:34.166
We need a disguise or something.
In here. Grab the first thing you can.

1:02:35.541 --> 1:02:37.916
Uh... What?

1:02:41.291 --> 1:02:42.708
It's the Rescue Rangers!

1:02:42.791 --> 1:02:46.291
-Oh, my gosh! I am your biggest fan!
-Oh, my God.

1:02:49.375 --> 1:02:52.375
Cook-a-rook-a-roo!

1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:55.458
Think happy little thoughts.

1:02:55.541 --> 1:02:57.375
Definitely pulled something.

1:02:57.458 --> 1:02:59.875
You keep going, I'll catch up.

1:02:59.958 --> 1:03:01.166
Hey, give me that!

1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:03.166
Ugh! It's diet!

1:03:03.791 --> 1:03:07.875
-- Up here. Hey!

1:03:10.083 --> 1:03:14.041
By the axe of Ucarga,
you will submit to me!

1:03:21.416 --> 1:03:24.708
What are you doing? I got you!

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.625
What are you looking at?

1:03:30.750 --> 1:03:34.583
-Honestly, your weird dead eyes.
-They are weird.

1:03:34.666 --> 1:03:35.791
Super weird.

1:03:37.250 --> 1:03:38.375
So funny.

1:03:45.291 --> 1:03:47.958
Well, I'll be.
Chip and Dale together again

1:03:48.041 --> 1:03:49.791
Never thought I'd see the day.

1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:51.500
Get back here!

1:03:54.708 --> 1:03:55.708
Wow.

1:03:55.916 --> 1:03:59.166
-Yo, man, it's you!
-Baloo. Nice to meet you.

1:03:59.375 --> 1:04:03.666
No way! Can I touch your face?
I mean, what is going on?

1:04:03.750 --> 1:04:06.000
-- Quick, the elevator.

1:04:07.041 --> 1:04:08.416
-Oh, no!

1:04:08.583 --> 1:04:12.083
I command thee to halt!

1:04:12.291 --> 1:04:16.041
-You want a piece of me? Be my guest.

1:04:16.166 --> 1:04:17.708
Berserker!

1:04:17.791 --> 1:04:19.375
Ah, ah, ah!

1:04:19.666 --> 1:04:23.708
Hello, 911?
I have a rather unruly visitor here.

1:04:23.791 --> 1:04:26.208
-There's the exit.

1:04:30.125 --> 1:04:32.791
Go, Dale. Go!

1:04:32.875 --> 1:04:34.000
Come on, Chip!

1:04:37.875 --> 1:04:40.541
Quick! Hide up here!

1:04:53.375 --> 1:04:56.500
Chip?

1:04:58.541 --> 1:05:01.083
-Chip, where are you?

1:05:01.208 --> 1:05:03.583
-Where are you, buddy?

1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:09.958
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:05:11.375 --> 1:05:14.666
Hey, Steckler. I just got a tip.
I think your little chipmunk friends

1:05:14.750 --> 1:05:16.083
-are in trouble.
-I know, sir.

1:05:16.166 --> 1:05:19.041
-I'm heading to the Convention Center now.
-No, it's worse than that. Come on.

1:05:19.125 --> 1:05:20.875
We gotta move fast before it's too late.

1:05:20.958 --> 1:05:23.416
You're gonna arrest me
while Jack Skellington's been embezzling

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:25.916
from his own charity for years?
Everyone knows it!

1:05:28.250 --> 1:05:30.583
-Where's Dale?

1:05:30.666 --> 1:05:32.875
- He'll be here.
Keep your pants on.

1:05:32.958 --> 1:05:35.250
-I don't wear pants.
-Yeah, I noticed.

1:05:35.416 --> 1:05:37.375
It's not something to brag about.

1:05:37.458 --> 1:05:38.500
What do you want?

1:05:38.583 --> 1:05:41.208
I want you to stop messing
with my business.

1:05:41.333 --> 1:05:44.125
You exposed everything,
now I have to move all this stuff,

1:05:44.208 --> 1:05:46.208
and start over. It's super annoying.

1:05:46.500 --> 1:05:49.291
You should have just let me bootleg you
when you came to my office.

1:05:49.375 --> 1:05:51.958
Could have saved us both
a ton of headaches.

1:05:52.291 --> 1:05:53.291
Ah!

1:05:53.541 --> 1:05:58.125
Besides, I was always more
of an Alvin and the Chipmunks person.

1:05:58.375 --> 1:06:00.458
You monster.

1:06:00.541 --> 1:06:02.541
-- Freeze, Sweet Pete.

1:06:03.916 --> 1:06:06.166
Nah. How about you freeze?

1:06:08.041 --> 1:06:09.375
Drop it, Steckler.

1:06:10.125 --> 1:06:14.000
-What? Captain Putty?
-Dale was right.

1:06:14.083 --> 1:06:18.000
-How cliché.
-I know. It is a bit unoriginal, right?

1:06:18.083 --> 1:06:19.833
Sweet Pete, remember
when you first approached me

1:06:19.916 --> 1:06:22.041
to turn bad, be a bad guy, work with you,

1:06:22.125 --> 1:06:24.958
and I was like,
"Come on! That's too predictable."

1:06:25.041 --> 1:06:26.625
Yeah. And what did I say?

1:06:26.708 --> 1:06:28.041
-"If it ain't broke..."
-"If it ain't broke..."

1:06:30.375 --> 1:06:32.875
-How could you?
-I know, I know. It's terrible.

1:06:32.958 --> 1:06:37.791
I am so ashamed. But I had no choice.
My mother needed an operation.

1:06:37.875 --> 1:06:41.416
See, she got injured
playing a game of Operation.

1:06:41.500 --> 1:06:44.125
She got too close to the sides
and, uh...

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:48.250
...she got buzzed really bad.

1:06:48.333 --> 1:06:52.791
Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it any longer.

1:06:52.875 --> 1:06:54.875
Money! I'm a greedy little Smurf

1:06:54.958 --> 1:06:57.625
-who did it for the money.
-Hilarious.

1:06:57.708 --> 1:06:59.750
Yeah, but I had you going there
for a second, didn't I?

1:06:59.833 --> 1:07:03.625
"Hello, I think I just saw Peppa Pig
heading into Nickelodeon Jr."

1:07:03.708 --> 1:07:05.666
-It was you?

1:07:06.458 --> 1:07:08.416
You gave the fake tip.

1:07:08.958 --> 1:07:11.625
You derailed the whole
investigation and...

1:07:11.708 --> 1:07:14.041
and worst of all,
you made me doubt myself.

1:07:14.125 --> 1:07:16.791
Oh, come on. Don't be so fragile.

1:07:16.875 --> 1:07:20.666
Oh, wow, wow, oh, wow!
Keep it together, Dale. Come on.

1:07:21.333 --> 1:07:22.875
-It's Ellie.

1:07:22.958 --> 1:07:27.000
Wait, no, Ellie could be bad.
But she also could be good.

1:07:27.083 --> 1:07:31.458
Oh, my brain hurts. I wish Chip was here.
He'd know what to do.

1:07:31.541 --> 1:07:32.791
Uh...

1:07:33.750 --> 1:07:36.166
-Hello?
-- Hey. You okay?

1:07:36.250 --> 1:07:39.041
Uh, yeah, totally fine. Why do you ask?

1:07:39.208 --> 1:07:42.083
You don't have to worry, Dale.
I know how to get Chip back.

1:07:42.250 --> 1:07:45.541
I'm down at the bootlegging facility.
Meet me here.

1:07:46.458 --> 1:07:47.625
And come alone.

1:07:47.708 --> 1:07:49.916
Well, that sounds super shady
and not safe at all.

1:07:50.041 --> 1:07:52.125
I know. But you have to trust me.

1:07:52.208 --> 1:07:55.916
And, Dale, "When You Fish Upon A Star,"
that's my favorite episode.

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.291
Oh. Kind of a deep cut.
Why is that your favorite?

1:07:59.375 --> 1:08:01.708
-Hello? Huh.

1:08:01.791 --> 1:08:04.416
I mean, "When You Fish Upon A Star"
is a good episode,

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:06.458
but I wouldn't call it great.

1:08:06.625 --> 1:08:09.208
Why did you tell Dale to come?
You should have protected him.

1:08:09.291 --> 1:08:11.916
I gave him a secret message. A code.

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.083
Dale forgets his own phone number.
How is he gonna break a code?

1:08:16.250 --> 1:08:18.583
Listen up, you rejects
from a science lab.

1:08:18.666 --> 1:08:20.916
-I didn't think of this extraordinarily

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.291
brilliant plan, only to have

1:08:22.458 --> 1:08:24.791
-you idiots wreck the wrong ship.
-Still holds up. It's a great show.

1:08:24.875 --> 1:08:27.500
-- A ship full of worthless junk!
-Ah, no! Focus, Dale. Come on.

1:08:27.583 --> 1:08:29.791
-Ellie is sending a message, but what?
-- ...you know?

1:08:29.875 --> 1:08:33.333
Your little friends would never dream
of leaving you hanging here.

1:08:33.416 --> 1:08:36.458
-Would they?
-All right. Think, Dale, think.

1:08:36.541 --> 1:08:41.500
Gadget is stuck in a lantern.
Lanterns provide light by using fire.

1:08:41.583 --> 1:08:44.791
Fire is really cool,
but also really dangerous.

1:08:45.041 --> 1:08:47.083
Someone is in a dangerous situation.

1:08:47.166 --> 1:08:49.125
Oh, like that time I dropped
a bowling ball on my toe.

1:08:49.208 --> 1:08:52.791
Ellie has ten toes
and she probably likes Thai food.

1:08:52.875 --> 1:08:56.375
Ellie is tied up and in danger,
and Chip is with her.

1:08:56.500 --> 1:08:58.875
It was Putty working
with Sweet Pete the whole time.

1:08:58.958 --> 1:09:01.166
-I cracked it. I'm coming, guys.

1:09:07.375 --> 1:09:09.958
Come on.
Start, start, start, start!

1:09:10.041 --> 1:09:12.541
No. No, no, no.

1:09:16.875 --> 1:09:17.875
Huh.

1:09:31.958 --> 1:09:35.625
- Honey, someone's doing
a cool pose in the driveway.

1:09:39.125 --> 1:09:43.583
Excuse me. Dale, old chum.
The sight of you lights my heart aglow.

1:09:43.666 --> 1:09:45.708
Rangers, I need your help.

1:09:45.791 --> 1:09:50.375
We love you, bud, but we just can't invest
in any more of your independent movies.

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:53.458
What... No, I'm not here for that.
I'm here for something very important.

1:09:53.541 --> 1:09:56.291
Although that script was pretty good.
Did you even read it?

1:09:57.458 --> 1:09:59.583
- Chip, I wanna do something
extra special for you.

1:09:59.666 --> 1:10:02.166
How would you feel
about playing your old character,

1:10:02.250 --> 1:10:06.041
but with feet for ears, and a dog snout
where your tail should be?

1:10:06.166 --> 1:10:08.750
Okay, honest feedback,
that sounds terrible.

1:10:08.833 --> 1:10:10.250
You're gonna like the way you look.

1:10:10.333 --> 1:10:12.666
-I guarantee it.
-You'll never get away with this.

1:10:12.833 --> 1:10:15.458
The Men's Wearhouse reference?
Yeah, I think I will.

1:10:15.875 --> 1:10:18.208
Okay, let's make some changes.

1:10:18.291 --> 1:10:20.291
Cook-a-rook-a-roo!

1:10:20.416 --> 1:10:23.083
-- Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whee!

1:10:23.166 --> 1:10:27.000
This is awesome!
I'm amazed this thing actually flies.

1:10:27.083 --> 1:10:28.708
And you know how to fly it.

1:10:28.791 --> 1:10:31.125
Yeah. I guess my character
from the old show,

1:10:31.208 --> 1:10:34.708
and my character in real life
are basically exactly the same.

1:10:34.791 --> 1:10:37.833
Yeah, I guess so.
Zipper, how are the kids?

1:10:37.916 --> 1:10:40.458
Splendid. I mean, sure,
being a stay-at-home dad

1:10:40.541 --> 1:10:42.833
has its challenges,
but it's the most rewarding job

1:10:42.916 --> 1:10:44.375
-I could ever ask for and it just...

1:10:44.458 --> 1:10:47.708
Whoa! It's actually my agent.
Sorry, can you hold on for a second?

1:10:48.791 --> 1:10:52.083
Wow! Dave Bolinari.
Haven't heard from you in a while.

1:10:52.166 --> 1:10:54.833
Did you not get my last seven years
of messages?

1:10:54.916 --> 1:10:57.833
Oh, Daley, brother, so sorry.

1:10:57.916 --> 1:11:00.750
Look, I got a new assistant,
and then we were off for the holidays.

1:11:00.833 --> 1:11:03.208
Anyways, I'm watching the news.

1:11:03.291 --> 1:11:06.375
You're the talk of the town.
We've got heat. We've got offers.

1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:09.458
I'm thinking book deal.
I'm thinking reboot.

1:11:09.541 --> 1:11:12.083
Hey, actually, can I call you back?
I can't talk now.

1:11:12.166 --> 1:11:15.333
What? But, Dale, you gotta get
your priorities straight, dawg.

1:11:15.416 --> 1:11:17.583
You know what?
I think for the first time in my life,

1:11:17.666 --> 1:11:19.666
I am getting my priorities straight.

1:11:19.750 --> 1:11:23.666
Friends are more important
than business.

1:11:23.750 --> 1:11:25.750
-- Dale, brother.
-Good for you, Dale.

1:11:25.833 --> 1:11:27.875
Probably shouldn't have
thrown your phone, though.

1:11:27.958 --> 1:11:29.750
Nope. Immediately regretted it.

1:11:29.916 --> 1:11:31.500
-Well, it was a good run.

1:11:31.875 --> 1:11:34.750
-No, it wasn't. Who am I kidding?
-Okay, let's see.

1:11:34.833 --> 1:11:37.416
Dog snout right on the butt.

1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:39.875
It's hilarious. Chip doesn't know
what he's talking about.

1:11:41.458 --> 1:11:43.625
Stop him, Captain!
You're better than this.

1:11:43.708 --> 1:11:44.833
No, I'm not.

1:11:45.666 --> 1:11:49.333
Ah, there it is.
The foreboding fortress on the horizon.

1:11:49.416 --> 1:11:53.208
-Oh, I love it when you talk fancy, honey.
-Thank you, my love.

1:11:53.291 --> 1:11:55.333
-Aw.
-Looks like the only way in

1:11:55.416 --> 1:11:59.458
-is through that exhaust pipe.
-Okay, good. Try to line me up with it.

1:11:59.541 --> 1:12:03.708
-Are you sure you wanna do this, Dale?
-As sure as I've ever been.

1:12:03.791 --> 1:12:06.916
But you're, like, known
for constantly making terrible decisions.

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.458
-I know, right?
-Rescue Rangers, away.

1:12:18.625 --> 1:12:20.666
Huh. At least that's gone.

1:12:20.791 --> 1:12:26.958
Whoo! Hold on, Chippy!

1:12:53.791 --> 1:12:57.208
-No! No, no, no, no. Come on!
-Hey, hey. Fix that.

1:12:57.291 --> 1:12:59.875
-You should fix it.
-Oh, yeah. Thanks for the input, genius.

1:13:00.166 --> 1:13:02.333
-Ellie.
-Dale.

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.666
Hey, are you okay? Where's Chip?

1:13:04.833 --> 1:13:06.833
-He's still in the machine.
-Over here.

1:13:07.166 --> 1:13:08.958
-Chip, you're okay.
-Yeah.

1:13:09.125 --> 1:13:11.541
You came for us.
I never doubted you, buddy.

1:13:13.208 --> 1:13:16.500
-See? He understood the clue.
-Of course, it was obvious.

1:13:16.666 --> 1:13:20.750
In "When You Fish Upon a Star,"
Gadget was double-crossed. Just like us.

1:13:20.875 --> 1:13:22.916
Right. Totally.

1:13:23.041 --> 1:13:24.583
You had a completely
different take, didn't you?

1:13:24.750 --> 1:13:28.875
-Yes, mine involved Thai food.
-Stop! Or I'll erase him right here.

1:13:28.958 --> 1:13:31.583
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.
-Wait.

1:13:31.666 --> 1:13:35.833
-Let's talk about this.
-Listen, I get how you feel.

1:13:35.916 --> 1:13:38.041
Things didn't work out
the way you wanted, right?

1:13:38.333 --> 1:13:41.458
You had big hopes and dreams and,
well...

1:13:42.041 --> 1:13:44.250
...then the world
just sort of breaks your heart.

1:13:44.750 --> 1:13:49.500
And it feels like the only emotions
you have left are anger and loneliness.

1:13:50.208 --> 1:13:53.375
But you're not alone. None of us are.

1:13:53.708 --> 1:14:00.583
Wow. It's true. You two really are
the worst actors in Hollywood.

1:14:01.708 --> 1:14:03.541
Hey! What the... No!

1:14:05.750 --> 1:14:07.000
What the...

1:14:10.833 --> 1:14:12.333
What is going on with this thing?

1:14:19.083 --> 1:14:20.750
No, no, no. No!

1:14:38.041 --> 1:14:39.708
That was not cool.

1:14:40.708 --> 1:14:44.041
-Hey, are you okay?
-I think so.

1:14:44.583 --> 1:14:46.958
-Dale, are you hurt?
-No, I'm good.

1:14:52.208 --> 1:14:54.125
Huh?

1:14:58.541 --> 1:15:00.000
Uh-oh. Hey!

1:15:02.166 --> 1:15:03.166
-Oh.

1:15:05.833 --> 1:15:06.958
Oh.

1:15:07.333 --> 1:15:09.666
Ugh! And it smells too.

1:15:09.875 --> 1:15:14.750
Stupid glass. Okay, I'm out.

1:15:14.916 --> 1:15:17.125
-Putty, he's getting away.
-I'm on it.

1:15:34.208 --> 1:15:35.333
Meow.

1:15:35.416 --> 1:15:38.125
-Huh?
-I'm gonna wreck stuff.

1:15:38.208 --> 1:15:40.208
-Run!

1:15:47.291 --> 1:15:50.166
-Hey, up here.

1:15:51.291 --> 1:15:52.500
- You fools!

1:15:56.416 --> 1:15:57.833
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa!

1:16:05.916 --> 1:16:08.208
-Uh...

1:16:08.291 --> 1:16:10.958
-Where are we?
-Boh Barba.

1:16:11.833 --> 1:16:14.291
Pooj, The Fat Honey Bear? Ugh.

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.083
Keep going!

1:16:18.166 --> 1:16:20.583
Two words. Chipmunk soup.

1:16:22.250 --> 1:16:24.416
I guess they were making
the bootleg movies here

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:25.625
-the whole time.
-What the...

1:16:25.750 --> 1:16:27.500
-- Not overseas.
-Boy! Dorf!

1:16:27.583 --> 1:16:29.666
-Ay, pechanga!

1:16:37.583 --> 1:16:38.583
- Captain?

1:16:46.625 --> 1:16:49.875
It's all over. Just give yourself up.

1:16:51.791 --> 1:16:54.875
-Hello?

1:16:55.041 --> 1:16:57.000
Whoa!

1:16:57.083 --> 1:16:58.541
Whoa!

1:16:58.625 --> 1:17:01.083
-Oopsie daisy. Yoink, yoink.

1:17:07.166 --> 1:17:08.750
Heads-up.

1:17:11.125 --> 1:17:13.208
Oh, that actually made me dizzy.

1:17:14.625 --> 1:17:18.125
-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch out.

1:17:19.291 --> 1:17:23.041
Hey, get outta the way,
you little yahoos! Move it!

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:25.708
You're messing things up here.

1:17:26.125 --> 1:17:27.583
Coming through!

1:17:28.458 --> 1:17:29.500
- Grab on.

1:17:30.416 --> 1:17:32.958
Whoa!

1:18:04.375 --> 1:18:05.625
Yoo-hoo!

1:18:05.708 --> 1:18:08.125
-So close.

1:18:08.208 --> 1:18:11.250
-Okay.

1:18:16.250 --> 1:18:20.333
Ah, it's stuck to my face like
Silly Putty. Remember that stuff?

1:18:20.416 --> 1:18:22.958
-Let's finish this.

1:18:24.666 --> 1:18:26.791
Boing!

1:18:38.833 --> 1:18:43.083
Poor, sweet, little Ellie.
You never should've been a cop

1:18:43.166 --> 1:18:44.333
in the first place.

1:18:44.458 --> 1:18:49.000
Any last words? What? I can't hear you.
No? Okay. Bye, bye, you're dead.

1:19:03.250 --> 1:19:06.958
Hey, Putty. Don't be so fragile.

1:19:17.750 --> 1:19:19.750
-- No!
-- There's nowhere to go.

1:19:19.833 --> 1:19:20.875
We're trapped.

1:19:21.041 --> 1:19:24.041
-- I'm gonna find you!

1:19:24.166 --> 1:19:28.125
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1:19:28.208 --> 1:19:29.750
This is bad. Come on.

1:19:29.875 --> 1:19:31.833
Use that big old brain of yours,
Chip, think.

1:19:40.750 --> 1:19:41.750
- That's it.

1:19:41.833 --> 1:19:43.375
-Episode 325.
-Episode 325.

1:19:43.916 --> 1:19:48.333
-Here. It worked on Fat Cat. Hit me.
-No. This time you hit me.

1:19:48.416 --> 1:19:50.583
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Come on.

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:55.166
-Get right under it. Now, do it.
-Okay, here I go.

1:19:55.250 --> 1:19:56.916
Ow!

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.500
I can't believe we used
to do this to you every week.

1:19:59.625 --> 1:20:01.500
Come on, where are they?

1:20:04.541 --> 1:20:07.000
Oh, come on, Harold.
It's the middle of the night.

1:20:07.083 --> 1:20:09.416
-Just ignore it.
-We've been through this, Eileen.

1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:11.291
It's my job. Do not ruffle me right now.

1:20:11.375 --> 1:20:14.125
-It didn't work. You gotta hit me again.
-All right.

1:20:14.208 --> 1:20:16.416
-Ow!

1:20:16.625 --> 1:20:19.625
There you are.

1:20:19.708 --> 1:20:22.291
Enough playing around.
My turn. Here, give it a good whack.

1:20:22.375 --> 1:20:23.791
-Oh!

1:20:23.875 --> 1:20:26.958
Okay. Things are getting weird.

1:20:34.041 --> 1:20:35.708
This isn't good.

1:20:38.791 --> 1:20:40.583
-- Huh?

1:20:40.666 --> 1:20:43.208
Birds. Come here!

1:20:43.333 --> 1:20:44.958
-Go! Go! Go!

1:20:45.041 --> 1:20:47.250
What the...

1:20:48.250 --> 1:20:51.083
-- Almost there.

1:20:57.791 --> 1:21:00.000
Goodbye, Chip 'n Dale.

1:21:00.125 --> 1:21:01.458
-Huh?

1:21:01.541 --> 1:21:03.500
- This is the FBI.

1:21:03.583 --> 1:21:07.458
-We've got you surrounded.
-Yeah. Ugly Sonic!

1:21:07.541 --> 1:21:10.291
Take that!

1:21:10.666 --> 1:21:14.375
-Go, go, go, go. Come on, Dale. Hit it.
-Got it!

1:21:15.833 --> 1:21:20.166
Huh?

1:21:24.166 --> 1:21:26.708
-Yeah!
-Yes!

1:21:26.791 --> 1:21:30.375
See! I told you
I had a show, Dale.

1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:33.750
Ow! Stupid teeth,
I think I just bit my tongue.

1:21:33.833 --> 1:21:37.500
Whoo! We're the smartest chipmunks
on the planet.

1:21:46.333 --> 1:21:48.791
-You thought you could beat us?
-Ha!

1:21:49.208 --> 1:21:50.666
- Don't you know who we are?

1:21:50.916 --> 1:21:53.083
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale

1:21:53.250 --> 1:21:54.666
-Rescue Rangers
-Rescue Rangers

1:21:54.791 --> 1:21:56.541
-Chi... Chi... Ch... Chip and Dale
-Chi... Chi... Ch... Chip and Dale

1:21:56.666 --> 1:21:57.666
-When there's danger
-When there's danger

1:21:58.125 --> 1:21:59.750
-No, no, it never fails
-It never fails

1:21:59.875 --> 1:22:01.625
-Once they're involved
-Once they're involved

1:22:01.833 --> 1:22:04.833
-Somehow whatever's wrong gets solved

1:22:04.916 --> 1:22:09.666
Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers

1:22:09.833 --> 1:22:14.250
No!

1:22:21.583 --> 1:22:24.375
-- Down! Get down on the ground!
-All right, all right, Calm down.

1:22:24.625 --> 1:22:25.791
Dale?

1:22:26.041 --> 1:22:28.333
D... Dale, come on. Don't mess with me.

1:22:28.708 --> 1:22:31.208
Come on. Not this time, man.

1:22:31.750 --> 1:22:37.375
I know you're just pranking me.
I'm not falling for this twice. Come on.

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.000
Dale?

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:49.041
You... you know, the morning I met you,
when we were just kids at the cafeteria...

1:22:50.375 --> 1:22:54.125
I never told you this, but I begged my mom
to let me stay home from school

1:22:54.250 --> 1:22:56.958
because I didn't have any friends.

1:22:57.833 --> 1:22:59.583
CHIP'- You're a great kid, Chip.

1:23:00.625 --> 1:23:04.375
Remember, the biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all.

1:23:05.125 --> 1:23:08.291
You'll find a friend. I promise.

1:23:08.875 --> 1:23:13.666
- I was so scared and alone.
And I was lost.

1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:15.833
Just like you, Dale.

1:23:16.583 --> 1:23:20.833
And I needed you more than you needed me.

1:23:21.208 --> 1:23:23.708
Hey. Mind if I sit?

1:23:24.583 --> 1:23:28.333
All these years, I... I let you feel
like you were second banana

1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:31.833
because I wanted
to feel like first banana.

1:23:32.416 --> 1:23:34.166
I was nothing without you.

1:23:35.166 --> 1:23:38.083
So that night when...
In the trailer when... when you told me

1:23:38.166 --> 1:23:41.541
about Double-0 Dale,
I... I just should have told you that.

1:23:41.750 --> 1:23:44.791
I shouldn't have treated you that way.

1:23:45.708 --> 1:23:49.291
I'm sorry, Dale.

1:23:52.875 --> 1:23:55.958
-Really?
-Dale!

1:23:56.375 --> 1:23:59.375
-But how'd you...
-This thing's too special to throw away.

1:23:59.833 --> 1:24:03.750
-Ow! That pog smashed my nose.
-That worked out well.

1:24:03.916 --> 1:24:06.166
-You saved my life.
-Eh.

1:24:06.500 --> 1:24:08.041
You'd do the same for me.

1:24:08.166 --> 1:24:10.583
Wait. Hold on a second.

1:24:10.666 --> 1:24:12.916
If they were filming
the bootleg movies here,

1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:14.000
you don't think...

1:24:14.541 --> 1:24:15.541
-Monty!
-Monty!

1:24:33.708 --> 1:24:37.666
-Whoa. Okay, okay. Slow down.
-Do you see him?

1:24:39.666 --> 1:24:41.000
- Monty?

1:24:41.083 --> 1:24:42.083
I don't see him.

1:24:42.750 --> 1:24:43.750
Monty?

1:24:55.583 --> 1:24:58.291
-Mates!
-- Oh, Monty!

1:24:58.666 --> 1:25:01.291
-We thought we lost you.
-Oh, thank goodness.

1:25:01.375 --> 1:25:04.000
-You never gave up on me.
-Of course not.

1:25:04.250 --> 1:25:07.875
-We'd never give up on friends.
-Oh, what did they do to you?

1:25:08.166 --> 1:25:10.916
Ah, Chipper. They Dumbo'd me.

1:25:11.041 --> 1:25:13.875
Don't worry. I've got a guy
that'll fix those ears, no problem.

1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:15.250
Oh, thank you, Dale.

1:25:15.333 --> 1:25:19.916
-No way. Is that...
-Wow, those ears are huge.

1:25:20.125 --> 1:25:23.583
Gadget, Zipper. I must be dreaming.

1:25:26.291 --> 1:25:30.166
Can you believe it?
All the Rescue Rangers together.

1:25:30.583 --> 1:25:34.291
It has been a long time.
It's really good to see you guys.

1:25:34.375 --> 1:25:39.250
-It is wonderful to see you all.
-Wow, look at what you guys did.

1:25:47.083 --> 1:25:49.083
-You're under arrest,

1:25:49.166 --> 1:25:52.666
you low-rent Gumby. He's all yours, boys.

1:25:52.833 --> 1:25:55.875
Nice work on this case.
The FBI could use someone like you.

1:25:55.958 --> 1:25:59.583
Thanks. But I think I'd like to start
my own detective agency.

1:26:00.041 --> 1:26:02.500
-Hey, Ellie, get over here.

1:26:03.750 --> 1:26:07.000
Gang. I'd like you to meet
our dear friend, Ellie.

1:26:07.083 --> 1:26:08.833
None of this would have been
possible without her.

1:26:08.916 --> 1:26:13.750
-As it turns out, she's a...
-Fan. I am a huge fan.

1:26:13.833 --> 1:26:15.125
Well, nice to meet you.

1:26:15.208 --> 1:26:16.750
-Hello.
-Greetings.

1:26:16.833 --> 1:26:20.916
You know, Dale, I'm sorry it took all this
to get us back together.

1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.250
Oh, Chip. Come here.

1:26:24.500 --> 1:26:27.125
Crikey. I'd cry if they didn't erase
me tear ducts.

1:26:27.208 --> 1:26:30.708
To err is human, to forgive, divine.

1:26:30.833 --> 1:26:33.666
Sometimes, I can't tell
what you guys like more.

1:26:33.791 --> 1:26:40.000
-Eating nuts or driving us nuts.

1:26:41.666 --> 1:26:46.166
I've always wanted to do
one of these laughs with you guys.

1:26:46.291 --> 1:26:51.041
-How long does it last?
-The worse the joke, the longer the laugh.

1:26:57.666 --> 1:27:01.750
- So, Chip. Does this mean
we are officially friends again?

1:27:01.833 --> 1:27:05.083
- Heh. Sure. I guess some things
are worth rebooting.

1:27:05.166 --> 1:27:07.833
- You said it.
You wanna do a Rescue Rangers reboot.

1:27:07.958 --> 1:27:10.125
- No, I didn’t.
That is not what I meant.

1:27:10.208 --> 1:27:12.583
I mean, maybe.
I’d have to see the script first.

1:27:12.666 --> 1:27:16.083
- Oh, yes. That's a yes.
Hey, do you think we can get,

1:27:16.166 --> 1:27:18.333
-like, a pop star to do the theme song?
-- Yeah, right.

1:27:18.416 --> 1:27:22.416
Like a super serious version, even though
everyone just wants to hear the original.

1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:24.375
- Yes! That exactly.

1:27:27.708 --> 1:27:29.250
Sometimes

1:27:29.541 --> 1:27:33.958
Some crimes
Go slipping through the cracks

1:27:34.541 --> 1:27:38.833
But these two gumshoes

1:27:39.333 --> 1:27:41.958
Are picking up the slack

1:27:42.041 --> 1:27:45.583
There's no case too big
No case too small

1:27:45.833 --> 1:27:50.708
-When you need help just call
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale

1:27:50.916 --> 1:27:53.708
-Rescue Rangers
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale

1:27:53.791 --> 1:27:57.583

Somehow whatever's wrong gets solved

1:28:46.166 --> 1:28:53.166
Grey skies, it's trouble
Bad guys see double

1:28:53.625 --> 1:28:56.083
When they're around

1:28:56.208 --> 1:28:59.166

1:29:31.166 --> 1:29:35.458
- Boo! Hiss!
We want Darkwing! We want Darkwing!
