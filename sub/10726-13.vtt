WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:03.467
So I made it through my year
of coming out to the world.

00:03.492 --> 00:05.295
It went better than expected,

00:05.320 --> 00:07.889
but there was still one
social hurdle to clear.

00:07.914 --> 00:08.827
- So?
- Yes.

00:08.852 --> 00:09.850
Prom.

00:09.875 --> 00:12.947
An opportunity wasted
on all these straight couples

00:12.981 --> 00:15.549
with no imagination
and zero design sense.

00:15.584 --> 00:17.533
Hey, I want to pitch you
my prom-posal for Lacey.

00:17.558 --> 00:19.441
- Oh.
- Roses.

00:19.466 --> 00:20.541
And?

00:20.566 --> 00:22.356
From the grocery store.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.676
Okay, I will fix this later.

00:23.701 --> 00:25.714
Right now I have to go
to V.P. Murray's office

00:25.722 --> 00:28.157
and demand that this school
let me take a boy to prom.

00:28.191 --> 00:31.227
And not just for me, but for
all gay kids who follow.

00:31.261 --> 00:33.996
Dude! Hey! You messed up my banner!

00:34.031 --> 00:35.544
Fine. I'll help you fix it,

00:35.569 --> 00:37.388
but this is a high-traffic area.

00:37.413 --> 00:38.763
You did not think this through.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.372
Don't just stand there.
Where's your glitter glue?

00:40.397 --> 00:43.139
- What?
- You're a lost cause.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.874
I don't know.

00:44.908 --> 00:46.208
If I accept his friendship,

00:46.243 --> 00:48.085
isn't that sending the wrong message?

00:48.110 --> 00:49.912
You frenched your children's
vice principal.

00:49.946 --> 00:51.580
I'd say that sends
a pretty strong message.

00:51.615 --> 00:53.015
Now it's your job to gather intel

00:53.050 --> 00:54.550
and see if you want to take it further.

00:54.584 --> 00:55.685
Okay, fine.

00:55.719 --> 00:57.019
I'll do it.

00:58.322 --> 01:00.523
Yes!

01:00.557 --> 01:04.260
And now the dance begins.

01:05.629 --> 01:07.997
- Oh.
- Oh, dear Lord.

01:08.031 --> 01:09.465
He's wearing shorts.

01:09.499 --> 01:11.600
Hey.

01:11.635 --> 01:12.968
Hey, you know what,

01:13.003 --> 01:15.271
Jimmy's been asking for money
for a limo for prom.

01:15.305 --> 01:16.439
Does he even have a date?

01:16.473 --> 01:19.055
No. He's still working
on his prom-posal.

01:19.469 --> 01:21.580
These days, kids make a bigger
deal out of asking each other

01:21.605 --> 01:23.579
to prom than you did asking me
to marry you.

01:23.613 --> 01:25.582
It feels like they've been
talking about this prom for months.

01:25.607 --> 01:26.652
I'll be excited when it's over.

01:26.677 --> 01:28.698
Oh, I like seeing children
in evening wear.

01:28.723 --> 01:30.486
I like seeing cats in glasses.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.456
Well, done with this conversation.

01:34.891 --> 01:36.325
Oh, my God, V.P. Murray

01:36.360 --> 01:38.241
has liked all your photos in that time.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.663
He liked that I liked Talbots?

01:40.697 --> 01:42.131
What's this video?

01:42.165 --> 01:44.820
Here it is... an original
composition on my theremin.

01:44.845 --> 01:47.446
Uh, fun fact... this is
the only one in Illinois.

01:52.918 --> 01:54.919
Nope. I'm out. Un-friend.

01:56.947 --> 01:58.406
What?! Where did she go?

01:59.681 --> 02:01.242
Uh, Kenny, hey.

02:01.267 --> 02:02.838
Apropos of nothing,

02:02.863 --> 02:04.832
do you know if your mom changes
her privacy settings often,

02:04.857 --> 02:07.074
you know, on the social media
and... and the like?

02:07.099 --> 02:09.597
V.P. Murray, it is my right
as an American citizen

02:09.622 --> 02:10.854
and a student of this school

02:10.880 --> 02:13.027
to have the freedoms allowed
to all the other students.

02:13.052 --> 02:15.292
- You want to take a boy to the prom.
- If the supreme court could see fit...

02:15.317 --> 02:17.411
- You can take a boy to the prom.
- I have a letter from a lawyer.

02:17.436 --> 02:18.378
Well, then, frame it

02:18.403 --> 02:20.886
because you are taking a male
to the prom.

02:20.911 --> 02:22.045
Who's the lucky guy?

02:22.070 --> 02:24.887
Oh, crap. There is no lucky guy.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.843
I did not think this through.
Cover. Cover.

02:27.868 --> 02:31.203
I'm the lucky guy for taking
this brave step forward.

02:31.228 --> 02:32.281
Freedom.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.798

<font color="#32a615"><b>www.addic7ed.com</b></font>

02:38.021 --> 02:39.784
That's all I was asking for.
You know, I like...

02:39.809 --> 02:41.785
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi.

02:41.810 --> 02:43.567
I wanted to make sure you got
the math assignment.

02:43.592 --> 02:44.659
Oh.

02:46.235 --> 02:48.029
No, thanks, Ethan. I'm good.

02:50.732 --> 02:53.301
Shannon, you didn't even think about it.

02:53.447 --> 02:54.611
You know, some people had to fight

02:54.636 --> 02:55.650
for the right to go to prom.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.682
Once they had that right,
had no one to go with.

02:57.707 --> 02:58.768
I'm talking about me.

02:58.802 --> 03:00.036
I just don't understand

03:00.070 --> 03:01.918
why you want to get hysterically
excited about prom,

03:01.943 --> 03:04.168
only to be utterly disappointed
by the outcome.

03:04.193 --> 03:05.465
Because I am an American!

03:06.574 --> 03:07.721
But I'm never gonna get what I want

03:07.746 --> 03:09.565
'cause I'm the only gay kid
in this whole school.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.580
Hi.

03:10.614 --> 03:11.742
What about clearly gay Stuart?

03:11.767 --> 03:14.375
Come here. Mah!

03:14.400 --> 03:17.194
Well, I'm starting to think
he might just be "Stuart."

03:17.221 --> 03:19.506
Maybe you could go with that
barista from Rigby's Roasters.

03:19.531 --> 03:20.594
Isn't he gay?

03:20.619 --> 03:22.892
Are you saying that because
he's the only other gay guy you know?

03:22.927 --> 03:24.411
Yes.

03:24.436 --> 03:25.091
What's up?

03:25.116 --> 03:27.829
Jimmy, can you think of any
gay guys Kenny can take to prom?

03:27.854 --> 03:30.253
Oh! What about the barista
from Rigby's Roasters?

03:30.278 --> 03:32.462
- Wasn't he gay?
- You think I'm gonna take somebody

03:32.487 --> 03:33.860
when the only thing we have in common

03:33.885 --> 03:35.024
is that we're both gay?

03:35.049 --> 03:36.173
I think that's more important

03:36.198 --> 03:37.965
than, say, uh, you both liking tennis.

03:37.990 --> 03:39.457
Yo! What up, Lacey?!

03:40.077 --> 03:41.444
Hey, Jimmy.

03:41.478 --> 03:42.745
You smell like eggs.

03:44.748 --> 03:46.380
What are you doing?

03:46.405 --> 03:47.638
You could have asked her right there.

03:47.663 --> 03:50.198
As you can see,
I'm not good off the cuff.

03:50.223 --> 03:51.301
I have to plan it.

03:51.326 --> 03:53.627
Yeah? Well, I don't even
have anyone to plan for.

03:53.652 --> 03:55.741
And I'm not asking for much.

03:55.766 --> 03:59.405
I just want love at first sight
with the perfect boy

03:59.430 --> 04:03.022
and the perfect kiss
and the perfect night.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:22.119 --> 04:23.765
May I have this dance?

04:23.790 --> 04:25.365
Absolutely.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.993
This is perfect.

04:32.018 --> 04:33.579
I can never hear enough ABBA.

04:36.589 --> 04:38.790
Wait.

04:39.504 --> 04:40.703
Why is he still here?

04:40.738 --> 04:42.299
Do you guys see him, too?

04:42.324 --> 04:43.873
The Nordic twink in the hoodie?

04:43.907 --> 04:45.917
Kenny, this is Sebastian,

04:45.942 --> 04:47.965
our new Swedish
foreign exchange student.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.513
I thought you'd want to meet him
since you both play for the same team.

04:50.547 --> 04:52.187
And I'm not talking about a sports team.

04:52.212 --> 04:53.249
You're both gay.

04:53.283 --> 04:55.571
Just because they're both gay
doesn't mean that they want...

04:55.596 --> 04:57.863
Shut up. Hi!

04:57.888 --> 04:59.055
I'm Kenny!

04:59.089 --> 05:00.777
Can you believe we're both gay?

05:00.802 --> 05:02.792
We have so much in common!

05:06.090 --> 05:07.479
What?

05:07.504 --> 05:09.012
Do you have any 2s?

05:09.037 --> 05:10.872
Nope. Go fish.

05:13.880 --> 05:14.914
Did we make that happen?

05:15.539 --> 05:16.557
I hope so.

05:16.582 --> 05:17.704
It works!

05:17.729 --> 05:19.139
Oh, and it's awesome!

05:19.173 --> 05:20.173
That's up for debate.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.975
This is gonna be the best
prom-posal ever.

05:22.009 --> 05:24.044
Lacey and Sebastian are for sure
gonna say yes.

05:24.078 --> 05:25.412
Because of a fish balloon?

05:25.446 --> 05:28.915
No, because of a self-mobilizing
fish drone.

05:28.950 --> 05:30.917
It's gonna hover over Sebastian
and Lacey,

05:30.952 --> 05:31.885
then I'm gonna pop it

05:31.919 --> 05:33.993
and it's gonna rain down Swedish fish,

05:34.018 --> 05:35.489
you know, 'cause Sebastian is Swedish.

05:35.523 --> 05:36.990
And Lacey loves processed foods.

05:37.024 --> 05:38.931
Prom is so over-hyped.

05:38.956 --> 05:39.974
It's for amateurs,

05:39.999 --> 05:41.694
like Valentine's Day and New Year's.

05:41.719 --> 05:43.725
- Mm-hmm.
- The most romantic night of your life

05:43.750 --> 05:46.200
could happen in a random
parking lot on a Tuesday night.

05:46.225 --> 05:48.404
You don't understand
gay or straight romance.

05:48.438 --> 05:50.206
I'm not sure you do, either.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.374
Fine!

05:51.415 --> 05:52.615
You'll see.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.704
- How'd it go?
- Great.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.118
I called Clive, and I told him
it's not gonna work.

05:57.132 --> 05:59.133
He took it really well,
and we parted as friends.

05:59.168 --> 06:01.632
In fact, I told him I'd help him
chaperone at the prom.

06:01.657 --> 06:03.506
Oh, my God, he's taking you to the prom.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.859
No, he is not!

06:04.893 --> 06:06.624
I am going as a single adult there

06:06.649 --> 06:08.410
to make sure the kids
don't grope each other.

06:11.768 --> 06:13.104
"Hey, boo.

06:13.815 --> 06:15.938
What color is your dress for the prom?

06:15.963 --> 06:17.891
I want my boutonniere to match"?

06:17.916 --> 06:19.227
See, he thinks it's a date.

06:19.252 --> 06:20.741
How can he possibly think that?

06:20.776 --> 06:23.704
Are you sure you were clear
with him when you broke it off?

06:23.729 --> 06:25.899
I told him I'm really busy right now

06:25.924 --> 06:27.181
and I'm not in a great place

06:27.216 --> 06:29.250
and I just don't think it's meant to be.

06:29.284 --> 06:32.567
Okay, see, what he heard is,
"when things die down,

06:32.592 --> 06:34.422
I'll be ready, so wait for me."

06:34.456 --> 06:36.457
I need your help.

06:36.492 --> 06:38.693
Teach me how to kill his hope.

06:38.727 --> 06:41.496
My whole life has led to this moment.

06:45.653 --> 06:47.887
Okay, there they are. There they are.

06:47.922 --> 06:48.922
Launch it.

06:51.158 --> 06:53.793
I told you you put too many
Swedish fish in the fish.

06:53.828 --> 06:55.495
No, but the physics were right.

06:55.529 --> 06:57.097
I calculated the trajectory.

06:57.131 --> 06:59.165
I just need to redistribute the weight.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.200
Sorry.

07:03.896 --> 07:05.163
- Got it.
- Aah!

07:05.214 --> 07:07.430
- Sorry. Okay, go!
- Uh, hello!

07:07.455 --> 07:09.852
Excuse me. Coming through.

07:09.877 --> 07:11.044
Wait, what the...?

07:11.078 --> 07:13.646
I'm coming out of the closet!

07:13.681 --> 07:16.583
And I'm gay for you, Sebastian.

07:16.617 --> 07:18.618
Prom... Question mark?

07:19.660 --> 07:20.814
Ja.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.540
Just when I gave him the benefit
of the doubt.

07:22.565 --> 07:23.865
Yes! Thank you!

07:23.890 --> 07:24.859
Damn it!

07:24.884 --> 07:26.882
Okay, look, I feel for you,
but let's get this fish moving.

07:26.907 --> 07:28.328
I still have a chance with Lacey, okay?

07:28.362 --> 07:29.443
Okay.

07:29.468 --> 07:31.231
Hey, Lacey!

07:31.265 --> 07:35.001
Wow, Devon. That's a lot of cheese.

07:35.035 --> 07:36.002
What do you say?

07:36.036 --> 07:37.270
"No."

07:37.295 --> 07:38.571
Sure!

07:38.606 --> 07:39.903
It's processed.

07:39.928 --> 07:40.809
That's her favorite.

07:40.834 --> 07:41.895
Why didn't I think of that?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.887
Because it's literally
the worst idea ever.

07:51.152 --> 07:52.585
Everyone is staring at us.

07:52.620 --> 07:54.053
What do we do?

07:54.088 --> 07:55.555
We melt their hearts.

07:55.589 --> 07:57.590
Kenny, my gay brother...

07:58.454 --> 08:00.193
...will you go to prom with me?

08:00.227 --> 08:02.395
Yes?

08:02.429 --> 08:04.397
Aww.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.573
This went exactly as we planned.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.644
I can't believe I took on
a Catholic school

08:13.669 --> 08:15.235
so I could take a same-sex date to prom,

08:15.260 --> 08:17.079
and the date ends up being my brother.

08:17.104 --> 08:18.572
It's too sad to even write
a country song about.

08:18.606 --> 08:20.851
Look, we're sitting
in the sweet spot right now.

08:20.885 --> 08:23.038
Everyone's hopes are super-high
for prom,

08:23.063 --> 08:24.296
but... but, like Shannon said,

08:24.321 --> 08:26.491
they will eventually be let down
by the reality.

08:26.516 --> 08:27.735
And that's where we swoop in,

08:27.760 --> 08:30.209
and we give Sebastian and Lacey
a night they will never forget.

08:30.234 --> 08:31.006
Maybe you're right.

08:31.031 --> 08:32.897
I mean, Stuart is borrowing
his mom's Passat,

08:32.922 --> 08:34.179
but there's no way he can sustain

08:34.205 --> 08:36.000
that level of excitement all evening.

08:36.034 --> 08:36.719
Exactly!

08:36.751 --> 08:38.318
And when their disappointment
is at its highest,

08:38.335 --> 08:39.676
they're gonna look over and go, "whoa,

08:39.701 --> 08:40.933
who are those handsome brothers

08:40.958 --> 08:42.828
getting all Hemsworth up in the prom?"

08:42.854 --> 08:43.895
- I'm Chris.
- I'm Chris.

08:44.380 --> 08:45.403
- I'm Chris!
- I'm Chris!

08:45.428 --> 08:46.594
Mm.

08:54.523 --> 08:56.157
Smile, love birds.

08:56.192 --> 08:57.792
This is so silly.

08:57.827 --> 08:59.660
All right, let's go find
Sebastian and Lacey.

08:59.684 --> 09:00.777
Okay.

09:01.289 --> 09:03.290
Vice Principal Murray,

09:03.315 --> 09:05.400
I may have not been clear enough

09:05.434 --> 09:07.335
in our previous conversation.

09:07.370 --> 09:11.072
I do not wish to date you
today or tomorrow

09:11.107 --> 09:12.907
or any time in the future.

09:12.942 --> 09:15.110
I will not date you here or there.

09:15.144 --> 09:17.278
I will not date you anywhere.

09:17.313 --> 09:18.513
Before you make your final decision...

09:18.547 --> 09:19.481
Couldn't be more final.

09:19.515 --> 09:20.973
...I have something to show you.

09:20.998 --> 09:23.066
Please, meet me in my office
in 10 minutes.

09:23.091 --> 09:24.892
Uh... mm.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.617
Give it.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.431
Chablis? Get out of here.

09:37.475 --> 09:40.702
See how bad prom sucks?

09:40.736 --> 09:42.468
You think it's gonna be
the night of your dreams,

09:42.500 --> 09:43.789
and the next thing you know,

09:43.814 --> 09:45.367
a bucket of pig blood is dropping on you

09:45.392 --> 09:46.726
in front of the entire school.

09:47.176 --> 09:49.210
I'd take Carrie's prom over ours.

09:49.278 --> 09:52.607
I mean, Moroccan mystique?
Let's be honest.

09:52.632 --> 09:54.816
That's just gonna look like
a cost plus world market.

09:56.218 --> 09:57.919
I'm glad I told Ethan no.

09:57.953 --> 09:59.521
Wait, hang on.

09:59.555 --> 10:02.090
You got asked to prom
by some guy named Ethan?

10:02.124 --> 10:03.925
He sounds amazing.
Why didn't you tell me?

10:03.959 --> 10:05.827
There was nothing to tell. Prom sucks.

10:05.861 --> 10:06.895
You said it yourself.

10:06.929 --> 10:09.487
Oh, honey, prom doesn't suck
for everyone.

10:09.512 --> 10:11.499
It just sucked for me
because I didn't have a date.

10:11.534 --> 10:13.401
Nobody wanted to go with fatty Patty.

10:13.436 --> 10:14.903
I thought nobody asked you,

10:14.970 --> 10:17.138
and I didn't want you
to feel bad like I did.

10:17.173 --> 10:19.328
I'm happy sitting here
watching "Carrie" with you.

10:19.353 --> 10:20.530
No, honey, trust me,

10:20.555 --> 10:22.043
you don't want to be my age and regret

10:22.077 --> 10:23.989
that you didn't get dressed up
and have a glamorous night

10:24.014 --> 10:25.215
with your friends and impress them

10:25.240 --> 10:26.674
with how well you do "the Tootsee Roll."

10:26.816 --> 10:28.082
What's "the Tootsee Roll"?

10:28.117 --> 10:30.318
It's only the most important
dance of 1994.

10:30.352 --> 10:32.153
Listen, you should go.

10:32.188 --> 10:34.592
I guess I could pull out
that junior bridesmaid's dress

10:34.617 --> 10:36.224
- from Aunt Stacy's wedding.
- Yeah.

10:36.258 --> 10:37.926
It used to hang on me like a bag,

10:37.960 --> 10:40.261
but I think I have the curves
now to pull it off.

10:40.296 --> 10:42.163
And you know what else boys really love?

10:42.198 --> 10:43.698
Turtlenecks.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.174
They don't look disappointed.

10:53.209 --> 10:54.233
When are they gonna look disappointed?

10:54.258 --> 10:55.446
Right now.

10:55.471 --> 10:56.352
We're gonna make them disappointed.

10:56.377 --> 10:58.055
We're gonna cut in.
We're gonna talk each other up.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.578
And then you pass Lacey off to me,
and I'll pass Sebastian off to you.

11:00.603 --> 11:01.492
That's smart.

11:01.517 --> 11:03.209
Man, you really flicker in
and out, don't you?

11:03.234 --> 11:04.586
- Yeah, I really do.
- Hmm.

11:07.589 --> 11:08.549
- May I cut in?
- What?

11:08.574 --> 11:09.962
The jocks are turning.
The jocks are turning.

11:09.987 --> 11:12.220
No. I want the Swede.

11:12.245 --> 11:14.246
Uh... All right.

11:14.271 --> 11:16.831
Hi. Excuse me, Devon.
This will take one second.

11:16.861 --> 11:18.218
All right.

11:19.438 --> 11:20.860
I don't know if you saw,

11:20.885 --> 11:24.004
but Jimmy looks rather dashing
in his tux.

11:24.029 --> 11:26.811
We're sort of the Hemsworths
of St. Barklay's.

11:28.676 --> 11:30.179
He's the Chris.

11:30.204 --> 11:32.884
You know, uh, I'm not actually gay,

11:32.918 --> 11:35.357
but if I were,
that fella right over there

11:35.382 --> 11:37.333
would be just my cup of tea.

11:37.358 --> 11:38.802
I do like tea.

11:38.827 --> 11:42.496
I want you to know Jimmy was
going to ask you to prom first.

11:42.531 --> 11:45.232
And if he hadn't spent so much time

11:45.267 --> 11:47.301
helping me with my prom-posal,

11:47.335 --> 11:49.303
you'd probably be here
with him right now.

11:49.337 --> 11:50.905
I was hoping that he'd ask me.

11:50.939 --> 11:52.940
Great. Follow my lead.

11:52.974 --> 11:54.008
Jimmy!

11:54.042 --> 11:54.975
Spin me.

11:55.010 --> 11:55.876
Whoa!

11:55.911 --> 11:57.044
Hey! No!

11:57.078 --> 11:58.249
- What? What?
- No!

11:58.274 --> 12:00.681
- Kenny, I can't see.
- No, that's not what I wanted.

12:00.715 --> 12:03.150
Kenny! No! No!

12:03.218 --> 12:04.285
Okay, that didn't work out.

12:04.319 --> 12:06.453
All right, when do I get
to dance with a chick, bro?

12:06.488 --> 12:07.488
Right now.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.962
Sebastian!

12:16.665 --> 12:19.889
There you are, you silly Swede.

12:26.868 --> 12:27.975
Thanks for coming.

12:28.009 --> 12:29.476
Uh, I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

12:29.511 --> 12:31.779
Oh, I already am.

12:40.322 --> 12:42.756
It's even worse in person.

12:43.835 --> 12:44.920
Smile.

12:44.945 --> 12:46.694
No, no, I'm just her dad.

12:46.728 --> 12:49.366
I'm only here to help her have
a magical prom night, but okay.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.134
Oh, look at that disco ball.

12:54.169 --> 12:56.704
It's just as wonderful as I imagined it.

12:56.738 --> 12:58.973
Oh, yes, it's a ball
with mirrors glued to it.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.175
We live in magical times.

13:01.209 --> 13:03.310
Okay, so which one of these guys
asked you?

13:03.345 --> 13:04.578
Ethan.

13:04.613 --> 13:06.413
He's right there in
the moss-green bow tie,

13:06.448 --> 13:08.449
but it looks like he's here
with somebody else.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.883
I'm gonna go get us some punch.

13:09.951 --> 13:12.553
Wait, there's punch? For free?

13:13.555 --> 13:15.389
Hey, green tie. Officer O'Neal.

13:15.423 --> 13:17.091
He's a cop?

13:17.125 --> 13:19.526
Uh, I'm not here
in my official capacity.

13:19.561 --> 13:21.428
I'm here just as Shannon's dad.

13:21.463 --> 13:22.529
Look, could you do me a favor

13:22.564 --> 13:23.697
and just give Shannon one dance?

13:23.732 --> 13:25.566
I don't want her to regret
saying no to you.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.468
You asked someone else first?!

13:27.502 --> 13:29.703
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

13:29.738 --> 13:30.971
Dad, what are you doing?

13:31.006 --> 13:33.474
Embarrassing me and making my date cry.

13:33.508 --> 13:36.296
I can see why you O'Neals
only date each other!

13:37.461 --> 13:38.728
I'm sorry, honey,
I want to make this right,

13:38.764 --> 13:39.764
but that girl's heading
for her drug purse,

13:39.798 --> 13:40.865
and I can't let that happen.

13:40.899 --> 13:43.601
Hey, don't smoke anything
out of that purse!

13:43.635 --> 13:44.668
I'm sorry, Ethan.

13:44.703 --> 13:47.136
This is exactly the kind
of dumb prom drama

13:47.161 --> 13:48.770
I did not want to get involved in.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.162
No, I'm glad this happened

13:50.188 --> 13:52.690
because my heart just wasn't
in it with Paula.

13:52.724 --> 13:54.391
You and I are like quantum entanglement.

13:54.426 --> 13:56.226
When one particle entangles
with the other,

13:56.261 --> 13:57.728
no matter how far the distance...

13:57.762 --> 13:59.396
They always affect each other.

13:59.431 --> 14:00.397
Exactly.

14:00.432 --> 14:04.201
Also, Dem curves are dangerous.

14:07.572 --> 14:09.306
Whoa.

14:12.877 --> 14:14.478
Stop! Stop!

14:15.556 --> 14:16.617
- Stop!
- Uh, uh, Eileen, wait.

14:16.641 --> 14:18.248
No, I don't want to be mean,

14:18.273 --> 14:21.342
but you're forcing me to say
these mean things.

14:21.353 --> 14:23.120
I don't like you.

14:24.223 --> 14:25.856
Look, you are a very nice man

14:25.890 --> 14:27.658
and a competent vice principal,

14:27.692 --> 14:29.460
and thank you very much

14:29.494 --> 14:32.496
for being my first...
First kiss in a long time.

14:34.633 --> 14:37.134
I was hoping that
you would ask me to prom...

14:37.168 --> 14:39.603
And then kiss me.

14:39.638 --> 14:42.706
Uh, I could still do one
of those things.

14:45.644 --> 14:47.277
Close your eyes.

14:50.168 --> 14:51.692
So, Clive...

14:52.771 --> 14:54.004
Goodbye.

15:01.923 --> 15:03.031
Jimmy?

15:16.685 --> 15:18.559
So, to recap,

15:18.584 --> 15:20.528
I had a chance to bring a guy to prom

15:20.544 --> 15:23.680
and ended up getting a pity
dance from Sister Ethelreda.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.518
So much for my high hopes for prom.

15:27.784 --> 15:29.181
Thanks a lot, ABBA.

15:29.206 --> 15:31.037
Sweden sucks!

15:32.337 --> 15:33.631
There you are.

15:33.656 --> 15:35.326
I've been looking for you everywhere.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.695
Is this really happening?

15:37.729 --> 15:39.296
'Cause I hallucinate sometimes.

15:39.331 --> 15:40.640
I'd rather be here with you tonight

15:40.665 --> 15:42.195
than the boy in the box who asked me.

15:42.220 --> 15:44.301
It's been all downhill since the Passat.

15:44.336 --> 15:45.882
I knew it.

15:45.907 --> 15:47.541
May I have this dance?

15:47.566 --> 15:48.734
Absolutely.

15:52.454 --> 15:53.337
This is it.

15:53.362 --> 15:54.892
After everything I've been through,

15:54.917 --> 15:57.446
coming out to my family,
coming out to my school,

15:57.471 --> 16:00.343
I'm finally going
to kiss a guy... at prom.

16:00.368 --> 16:02.011
And not just any guy...

16:02.043 --> 16:05.212
A Viking prince from the land of ABBA.

16:13.894 --> 16:15.128
Huh.

16:15.153 --> 16:17.688
Maybe I set the bar too high?

16:19.859 --> 16:23.130
Look, uh, this is weird for all of us,

16:23.155 --> 16:26.036
but your dad and I are moving on.

16:26.061 --> 16:28.554
It's just part of divorce.

16:28.579 --> 16:29.671
And I get that.

16:29.696 --> 16:31.203
What upsets me is that you could...

16:31.228 --> 16:34.001
you could totally do better
than Vice Principal Murray.

16:34.602 --> 16:35.615
Really?

16:35.640 --> 16:36.593
Yeah.

16:36.618 --> 16:38.152
You... you're smart.

16:38.177 --> 16:39.944
And you're funny.

16:40.001 --> 16:43.403
I mean, y-you remember that time the
neighborhood had a... had a peeping Tom?

16:43.438 --> 16:44.881
Who did he peep on first?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.640
You.

16:46.674 --> 16:48.341
That's true.

16:49.877 --> 16:52.038
It was really scary.

16:56.718 --> 16:59.019
I'm sorry I ruined your prom.

16:59.053 --> 17:01.888
I thought prom didn't matter
to me because it didn't,

17:01.923 --> 17:04.710
then Ethan referenced one of
the great mysteries of physics,

17:04.734 --> 17:07.461
and my heart got all fluttery at prom.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.529
I'm just like every other teenage girl.

17:09.564 --> 17:11.188
Honey, I hate to break it to you,

17:11.213 --> 17:13.567
but you are not like
any other teenage girl.

17:13.601 --> 17:14.797
Thanks.

17:14.821 --> 17:16.731
I pride myself on keeping my edge.

17:16.756 --> 17:19.358
Want to go catch up with Ethan, huh?

17:19.384 --> 17:21.218
No, our paths will cross again.

17:21.242 --> 17:23.009
Maybe in our 30s in Prague.

17:23.044 --> 17:25.078
Maybe in the 10th grade
on our teen tour.

17:25.113 --> 17:26.481
Ugh. There I go again.

17:26.506 --> 17:28.214
Yeah, I think we're all
getting a little caught up

17:28.249 --> 17:29.634
in the Moroccan mystique.

17:29.659 --> 17:31.952
Anyways, Ethan can wait.

17:31.986 --> 17:33.687
I already have a date.

17:33.721 --> 17:35.989
Hey, someone finally asked me
to the prom.

17:36.023 --> 17:37.758
Want to go to the snack table?

17:37.792 --> 17:39.693
There's a chocolate fountain.

17:39.727 --> 17:41.161
Oh, my God!

17:42.295 --> 17:44.498
He is so simple.

17:44.532 --> 17:45.932
All right, I'm having
a totally crappy time,

17:45.967 --> 17:47.277
and I'd like my date to take me home.

17:47.302 --> 17:48.302
What happened?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.268
All right, I'm gonna tell you

17:50.293 --> 17:53.039
because I'm very frustrated,
but no comments.

17:53.074 --> 17:54.708
Things didn't work out
with you and Sebastian?

17:54.742 --> 17:55.809
Well, we kissed.

17:55.843 --> 17:56.850
What?

17:56.875 --> 17:58.676
You had your first boy kiss?!

17:58.846 --> 18:00.180
That's awesome!

18:00.214 --> 18:03.044
Look at... look at it!
The O'Neals are getting some!

18:03.069 --> 18:03.934
Ha ha.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.452
I mean... except...
except for me. I'm not.

18:05.486 --> 18:06.920
But I'm... I'm still happy for you guys.

18:06.988 --> 18:09.523
"You guys"? What, Mom, did you get some?

18:09.557 --> 18:11.691
You were telling your story. Go on.

18:12.090 --> 18:15.262
Okay, well, Sebastian and I kissed,

18:15.296 --> 18:16.963
and I thought it was gonna be
this amazing moment.

18:16.998 --> 18:18.165
I mean, he is good-looking.

18:18.199 --> 18:20.294
He says his Y's like J's,
and he's short-tall,

18:20.319 --> 18:22.068
so he's not intimidating,
but he can still hold me.

18:22.103 --> 18:25.539
But it didn't feel as amazing
as I thought it would.

18:25.573 --> 18:27.089
I was expecting 4th of July,

18:27.114 --> 18:28.648
and it felt more like...

18:29.372 --> 18:30.768
August 9th.

18:31.104 --> 18:32.879
National Rice Pudding Day.

18:34.182 --> 18:36.716
It sucks that it was just...

18:38.613 --> 18:40.353
...ordinary.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.400
You know what that means.

18:43.425 --> 18:45.466
That I'm probably straight
and I should kiss a girl.

18:45.493 --> 18:46.934
No.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.044
It means you're normal.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.192
You think I'm normal?

18:53.217 --> 18:55.218
Of course I do.

18:55.243 --> 18:57.778
Listen. You can't force a connection.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.802
You don't know when it's gonna
happen or with whom.

19:01.981 --> 19:03.630
He may not dress the way you like

19:03.655 --> 19:06.433
or play an instrument
that doesn't sound like a...

19:07.011 --> 19:09.090
crying robot.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.650
You can't account for chemistry.

19:11.675 --> 19:13.643
Well, thank you.

19:13.668 --> 19:15.765
And it sounds like you have
quite a story to tell.

19:15.790 --> 19:16.625
For another day.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.532
- I now present to you this year's...
- What are you doing?!

19:18.557 --> 19:20.938
Everybody has to get inside this
totally rad prom right now!

19:20.963 --> 19:22.086
Jimmy and Kenny are being named

19:22.111 --> 19:23.778
non-gender-specific prom monarchs."

19:23.803 --> 19:25.437
- What?
- What?

19:29.777 --> 19:31.910
You have your mother's eyes.

19:33.103 --> 19:35.084
- Him and Mom?
- I'm afraid so.

19:38.355 --> 19:40.390
Do you have any music
from the olden times?

19:40.415 --> 19:41.865
Like 1994?

19:45.700 --> 19:48.702
I always knew I'd love prom!

19:48.727 --> 19:51.431
Once again, the O'Neals did
what we do best...

19:51.456 --> 19:53.324
We took an evening of disappointment

19:53.358 --> 19:54.338
and embarrassment,

19:54.363 --> 19:56.360
and we made it into a night to remember.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.963
My family has been through
a lot these last few months,

19:58.997 --> 20:00.998
and it's moments like these
that give me hope

20:01.033 --> 20:02.333
that we just might be...

20:03.669 --> 20:06.021
That's for kissing my date... whore!

20:07.719 --> 20:09.115
That's about right.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.714
Does our family spend
too much time together?

20:16.739 --> 20:18.377
Yes. Yes, we do.

20:18.698 --> 20:21.167
Aah, that Stuart has
a sharp little fist.

20:21.201 --> 20:22.868
- Hey, sorry about your kiss.
- Yeah.

20:22.903 --> 20:24.336
Was it at least better
than kissing a girl?

20:24.371 --> 20:25.566
Oh, hell, yeah.

20:25.591 --> 20:28.082
At this point, I would kiss anyone.

20:29.242 --> 20:31.444
Well... Lacey!

20:31.478 --> 20:33.879
Oh, Lacey, hey.

20:33.914 --> 20:35.943
I'm sorry about not kissing you earlier.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.351
The reason I...

20:40.629 --> 20:41.729
Cool!

20:44.399 --> 20:46.100
Kenny, I need you to dance with me.

20:46.134 --> 20:47.868
Don't ask why.

20:47.903 --> 20:49.198
Really, Mom?

20:49.223 --> 20:50.221
V.P. Murray?

20:50.246 --> 20:52.562
I didn't judge you. Don't judge me.

20:52.602 --> 20:53.602
Yeah, fair enough.
