00:06.758 --> 00:09.469
<i>And then when I heard
his car come in the driveway,</i>

00:09.636 --> 00:12.555
I would immediately bust into
my favorite <i>Solid Gold</i> dance moves.

00:12.722 --> 00:14.015
- What's that?
- You don't know what--

00:14.140 --> 00:15.433
It's like the best dance show
on television.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.768
- You don't know that?
- No.

00:16.935 --> 00:18.103
Oh, I'm so bummed.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.771
I'm learning so much
about you today, Patrick.

00:19.938 --> 00:21.398
Oh, God.

00:21.564 --> 00:24.401
Well, I would bust those moves,
I would run around the room,

00:24.567 --> 00:27.153
my dad was so annoyed, he would
be like, "Patrick, calm down."

00:27.320 --> 00:28.905
- "Shut the fuck up!"
- Exactly.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.281
Or just, like, stop dancing at least.

00:30.407 --> 00:31.449
Right.

00:31.616 --> 00:33.243
I couldn't help it, and then I'd
dance over to the door,

00:33.410 --> 00:34.661
and there he was.

00:34.828 --> 00:35.912
Your knight in shining armor.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.497
My dad's best friend, Tony.

00:37.664 --> 00:39.999
He was so hot.
He was so '90s.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.584
He even drove
a bright red motorcycle.

00:41.751 --> 00:42.961
- Of course he did.
- Right?

00:43.128 --> 00:44.796
And when you're little,
you just are really happy,

00:44.963 --> 00:46.506
but you don't
fully know exactly why.

00:46.673 --> 00:48.842
- You just need to dance.
- Yes! Thank you!

00:49.008 --> 00:51.261
I had a huge crush
on my dad's best friend, Tony,

00:51.428 --> 00:52.762
and I just needed to dance.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.347
- Yeah, me too.
- You too?

00:54.514 --> 00:57.809
When I was little, I was obsessed
with a boy band called Take That.

00:57.976 --> 00:59.018
- Oh.
- Do you know them?

00:59.185 --> 01:00.270
- No.
- They made it here? No?

01:00.395 --> 01:01.896
Anyway, they were
like a British version

01:02.021 --> 01:03.106
- of the Backstreet Boys.
- Oh.

01:03.273 --> 01:04.858
And I remember the first time
I saw their pop video,

01:05.024 --> 01:06.985
<i>Do What U Like,</i>
and looking back,

01:07.152 --> 01:08.695
I mean it's literally
the gayest thing ever.

01:08.862 --> 01:10.280
They're wearing
fringe leather jackets,

01:10.447 --> 01:12.615
all prancing around
rubbing food into each other.

01:12.699 --> 01:13.825
Oh, God.

01:13.992 --> 01:15.243
And I remember the first
time I watched it,

01:15.326 --> 01:17.287
I sat in front of the TV,
getting ready for school,

01:17.454 --> 01:19.622
eating my cornflakes,
and it pops up, and I thought,

01:19.789 --> 01:21.958
"What the fuck is this?"
you know?

01:22.125 --> 01:25.003
- Wow. I loved it.
- Amazing.

01:25.170 --> 01:28.631
I even-- I made up
a whole dance routine to it.

01:28.798 --> 01:31.050
- You did not make up a dance.
- Do you wanna see it?

01:31.217 --> 01:32.844
Uh, I need to see
your dance, yes, please.

01:33.011 --> 01:34.554
Okay. Well, don't judge me,
I'm a little bit rusty.

01:34.721 --> 01:35.889
Okay, no.
I wanna see it.

01:35.972 --> 01:37.307
- Um...
- Oh, I'm already impressed.

01:37.474 --> 01:40.685
Okay, well,
just give me a second.

01:41.478 --> 01:43.688
- No, I'm not gonna do it.
- Oh!

01:43.855 --> 01:45.356
- No, I'm too embarrassed.
- Come on.

01:45.523 --> 01:49.861
No, not gonna do it, but I'm
gonna show you something else.

01:50.028 --> 01:52.489
I wanted to see the dance.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.991
Oh, okay, booty dance,
that's fine, thank you.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.534
- Ba-bum!
- Oh!

01:56.701 --> 01:58.369
- That's the, uh--
- The game I told you about.

01:58.536 --> 01:59.829
- Yeah, yeah.
- Top Trumps.

02:00.038 --> 02:01.372
- Top Trumps!
- Yeah, I got them on eBay.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.208
Oh, my God.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.251
Even holding these cards again
makes me feel like a kid.

02:05.376 --> 02:06.461
Well, you gotta
teach me how to play.

02:06.544 --> 02:07.587
Yeah.

02:07.712 --> 02:09.047
- What-- The Circus of Death?
- Yeah.

02:09.214 --> 02:11.007
- That's a very dark game.
- Mm-hmm.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.717
- The Maggot.
- Hot.

02:12.884 --> 02:14.427
The fit-- oh, my God. These--

02:14.594 --> 02:16.721
Oh, Jesus, Patrick,
look, it's nearly 2:30.

02:17.388 --> 02:20.517
Oh, my God.
Godzilla in a pink bow tie?

02:20.683 --> 02:22.769
I am obsessed with this art.

02:22.936 --> 02:26.189
Yeah, get ready for the gayest
Dracula you've ever seen.

02:26.356 --> 02:29.734
- Uh-oh. Ooh!
- Girl.

02:29.901 --> 02:32.237
Patrick, there's literally
hundreds of these you can get,

02:32.445 --> 02:34.614
anything you can think of.
<i>Star Wars, Star Trek,</i>

02:34.739 --> 02:36.366
the Royal Family,
Miley Cyrus.

02:36.533 --> 02:37.742
- Wow.
- Cats.

02:37.909 --> 02:39.369
- Amazing.
- Mmm.

02:39.452 --> 02:41.037
I'm surprised there
isn't a gay one.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.373
Well, why don't we make
a gay game like this?

02:43.540 --> 02:46.042
For, I don't know,
for iPhones?

02:46.209 --> 02:48.253
Probably a bit busy making
first-person shooters

02:48.378 --> 02:49.420
for straight men.

02:49.587 --> 02:52.715
No, no, it could be like a cage match
for gay archetypes:

02:53.341 --> 02:56.052
you'd have the "hot jock"
versus the "drag mother."

02:56.219 --> 02:58.012
And then you could have, uh,

02:58.179 --> 03:00.890
"lusty lads of London"
against "gay for pay."

03:01.057 --> 03:03.226
"farm boy with big ideas."

03:03.393 --> 03:05.603
Oh, come on, don't we need
something else in our lives?

03:05.770 --> 03:07.564
Is this really why
we got into this industry?

03:08.982 --> 03:11.526
I don't think gay novelty games
is the reason either.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.111
Oh, the "ashamed gay."

03:13.278 --> 03:14.445
Another card.

03:14.612 --> 03:16.072
This game is practically
writing itself.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.116
Patrick, it's fucking ridiculous...

03:18.741 --> 03:20.410
which, of course, means
it would probably work.

03:20.535 --> 03:21.578
Right?

03:21.911 --> 03:23.454
So, what do you say?

03:24.706 --> 03:27.041
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yes!

03:27.166 --> 03:28.918
But listen, the company will own
every idea we come up with.

03:29.085 --> 03:30.253
So we'll need
to keep it on the sly.

03:30.420 --> 03:33.172
But I know you can
keep a secret, so--

03:33.339 --> 03:35.008
Sorry, Patrick,
that was bad taste.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.093
No, I, uh...

03:39.304 --> 03:41.139
I've been meaning
to tell you something.

03:41.306 --> 03:43.766
What?

03:43.933 --> 03:45.643
I told my friends.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.938
You-- You told
your friends about us?

03:49.272 --> 03:50.398
Really?

03:50.607 --> 03:52.442
But just Dom and Agustín.
Nobody else.

03:56.446 --> 03:58.364
What did they say?
Out of interest.

03:58.531 --> 03:59.991
Actually, you know what?
I don't want to know.

04:00.158 --> 04:01.826
But they obviously think
I'm a prick, do they?

04:01.993 --> 04:03.453
No, no, they don't
think you're a prick.

04:03.620 --> 04:06.164
They don't even know you.

04:06.331 --> 04:09.709
Yeah. Okay, come on.

04:09.876 --> 04:12.170
Uh, you-- You go on ahead,
I've got to, uh--

04:12.337 --> 04:14.797
I gotta make that phone call.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.800
- Go...
- Okay.

04:22.472 --> 04:25.308
- Where the fuck have you been?
- I was... I went to a movie.

04:25.475 --> 04:27.518
- In the middle of a workday?
- Yeah.

04:27.685 --> 04:30.980
I had to, uh, refill the well
of my creative unconscious.

04:31.147 --> 04:33.149
You read that
on some self-help blog?

04:33.524 --> 04:34.692
No.

04:34.776 --> 04:36.319
Well, what movie
did you pour in there?

04:36.486 --> 04:38.237
They're, uh... <i>Showgirls.</i>

04:38.404 --> 04:39.864
It's a revival thing
with drag queens.

04:40.073 --> 04:41.240
At lunchtime?

04:41.407 --> 04:43.159
Yeah, uh, Agustín's
friend organizes it.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.578
It's, um,
it's at the McClintock.

04:45.745 --> 04:48.373
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the McClintock.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.750
- What? Why?
- You haven't heard?

04:50.917 --> 04:53.503
- Bed bugs.
- What?

04:53.670 --> 04:56.589
You can't let them hear you.
It's bed bugs.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.549
- Shut up.
- Yeah, it's worse than ever.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.259
Movie theaters,
hotels, you know,

05:00.426 --> 05:03.012
I have a plastic suit I wear
if I'm going to either one.

05:03.179 --> 05:04.555
- You do not.
- I do.

05:04.722 --> 05:05.807
I can get you one
if you want.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.850
You have a plastic--

05:08.017 --> 05:10.395
Hey. Uh, yeah.

05:11.396 --> 05:12.689
I gotta go.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.732
- I'm worried about you.
- I'm worried about you!

05:14.899 --> 05:16.442
You don't have
a plastic suit.

05:16.609 --> 05:19.112
Movie theaters, hotels.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.913
So what do you think
about the "Fag Stag" card?

05:29.080 --> 05:32.125
A straight guy that only
hangs out with gay men.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.752
Did you say
something to him?

05:34.919 --> 05:38.089
Say something to who?
To Owen?

05:38.297 --> 05:39.799
You two were just
whispering to each other.

05:39.966 --> 05:41.426
Oh, yes, that.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.720
No, I'm sorry, I just...
I was just telling him

05:43.886 --> 05:46.931
about that nice, big,
juicy foreskin of yours.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.311
Oh, Patrick, please
don't joke about this.

05:52.478 --> 05:53.813
Of course I would never
say anything to Owen.

05:53.980 --> 05:55.648
It's such a small city.
You tell someone

05:55.857 --> 05:57.900
and they happen to mention it
to their fucking dog walker

05:58.067 --> 06:00.236
and let it slip to some
Castro queen,

06:00.445 --> 06:02.155
and suddenly
it's all over San Francisco.

06:02.321 --> 06:06.117
I really don't want
that to happen. Okay?

06:06.284 --> 06:10.079
Because... I don't
want this to end.

06:10.246 --> 06:13.166
Okay, yeah.
I won't let anyone know.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.127
I'm sorry. Just Dom
and Agustín know.

06:16.294 --> 06:17.628
Okay? It stops there.

06:18.713 --> 06:20.506
Cool. Sorry, I know
it's your friends, and--

06:20.673 --> 06:22.508
- No, it's okay.
- I'm--

06:24.177 --> 06:27.597
Okay, cool. Thanks.

06:28.848 --> 06:31.559
You don't think that hotel
has bed bugs, do you?

06:32.769 --> 06:37.148
- Huh?
- Hmm? No. Nothing.

06:38.483 --> 06:40.151
Okay, uh, have a good meeting.

06:40.318 --> 06:41.986
- Thanks.
- Okay.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.657
<i>But we went to this,
uh, this hotel,</i>

06:46.783 --> 06:47.909
<i>it's called the Morwood Hotel.</i>

06:48.618 --> 06:49.869
<i>- Oof!</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

06:49.952 --> 06:52.080
<i>- Shady lady.</i>
<i>- That place is so gross.</i>

06:52.246 --> 06:53.664
Even I wouldn't
go there for a hook-up.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.208
Were there cum stains
on the wall?

06:55.374 --> 06:57.502
Come on, don't you guys
find seedy motels kinda sexy?

06:57.668 --> 07:01.923
Not that place. It's been
a 24-hour meth party since '97.

07:02.090 --> 07:04.759
So do you guys just fuck
or do you talk too?

07:04.926 --> 07:07.053
We talk all the time. We spend
most of every day together.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.430
Well, what do you talk about?
Work doesn't count.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.807
I don't know. Whatever.
Normal things.

07:10.932 --> 07:12.016
What do people talk about?

07:12.141 --> 07:14.268
All kinds of things.
We talk about boy bands,

07:14.477 --> 07:16.395
- our childhood.
- What about Jon?

07:16.521 --> 07:17.855
- Thank you.
- Where is he in this?

07:17.939 --> 07:19.065
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

07:19.232 --> 07:20.441
But what I do know
is that he and Jon

07:20.608 --> 07:22.401
are having major problems.

07:22.568 --> 07:25.863
And I know how that sounds,
like the worst TV show

07:26.030 --> 07:27.365
you've ever seen,
but it's true.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.574
And it's none
of my business, anyway.

07:28.741 --> 07:30.576
So all we can do
is just live in the moment

07:30.743 --> 07:32.870
- and stay open with each other.
- Wide open.

07:33.037 --> 07:35.373
- Gross.
- Who paid for the room?

07:35.540 --> 07:37.041
- He did.
- Mm-hmm.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.043
You're like Julia Roberts
in <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

07:39.210 --> 07:41.879
Yep, shine up those
fierce thigh highs, Paddy.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.214
You're his dirty little secret.

07:43.381 --> 07:45.383
Well, secrets are freaking sexy.
And, look,

07:45.800 --> 07:46.884
I know it's because
you guys love me

07:47.051 --> 07:49.011
and you don't want to see me
get hurt, but this is happening.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.222
So just try and see it
from my perspective, okay?

07:51.389 --> 07:55.226
Don't speculate, don't judge,
just be supportive.

07:55.393 --> 07:57.770
I'm gonna be fine.
Really.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.355
You know what, Paddy?

07:59.522 --> 08:02.316
I'm happy for you that you're
getting nailed in your P-spot.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.819
Well, thank you.
Me too.

08:04.986 --> 08:08.573
And now you finally have someone
to bring home to Mommie Dearest.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.954
- It's a good neighborhood.
- It is, yeah.

08:15.121 --> 08:16.789
- I feel like it's up-and-coming.
- Totally.

08:16.956 --> 08:18.457
It is, totally, and there's
a lot of people who--

08:18.666 --> 08:20.793
- Confess your sins!
- Wow!

08:20.960 --> 08:22.503
- Fuck, Jesus.
- Okay.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.423
- Oh, my God.
- He's gonna work for me. Kidding.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.800
Good, good.

08:27.967 --> 08:30.178
So... here it is.

08:31.470 --> 08:34.015
- It's this?
- Yeah, this is it. It's cool, huh?

08:34.849 --> 08:37.310
- It's very cool.
- Confess your sins!

08:37.476 --> 08:40.104
So this is where
the chicken comes out?

08:40.271 --> 08:42.982
Yeah, we'll build a little
counter here and then an awning,

08:43.149 --> 08:45.526
and, uh, there will
be a couple benches here,

08:45.693 --> 08:49.030
and maybe a parklet
when I get the permits.

08:49.197 --> 08:51.657
Yeah. How much does it
cost to start it up?

08:51.824 --> 08:54.285
- It's much less than a restaurant.
- Like $10,000?

08:54.452 --> 08:55.953
Well, the kitchen
doesn't really exist yet.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.289
- So we'll have to build that out.
- It's like $20K?

08:58.414 --> 09:02.293
And the landlord wants
six months up front, so I need...

09:02.460 --> 09:04.295
- Eighty. Which is not that much.
- Eighty thousand!

09:04.462 --> 09:06.005
Confess your sins!

09:06.255 --> 09:08.090
He's fucking the boss
behind his boyfriend's back.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.092
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm confessing your sins.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.345
You can't do that! Homeless people
have Twitter accounts.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.305
- Guys, focus.
- Sorry.

09:14.472 --> 09:16.140
- Do you love it?
- It's great.

09:16.307 --> 09:17.433
- Right?
- Yeah.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.310
Why don't I get a picture
of the two of you in front of it.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.312
- Great idea.
- And then we can get out of here.

09:21.479 --> 09:23.105
- Think positive thoughts.
- Okay, yes.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.607
- Okay.
- Flash that 80K smile.

09:24.774 --> 09:26.192
Say chicken!

09:26.359 --> 09:28.611
- Chicken!
- Money!

09:28.778 --> 09:30.154
- Margaritzis.
- Yay.

09:30.321 --> 09:32.323
- Here's to you, Patrick.
- Thank you.

09:32.490 --> 09:35.868
- So, Patrick, how's the affair?
- Really?

09:35.993 --> 09:37.870
I didn't know it was a secret
until just now.

09:38.037 --> 09:39.288
It's an affair!

09:39.455 --> 09:42.667
I don't know if you know this,
I had an affair once.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.044
Uh, it was with a vet, okay?

09:45.211 --> 09:47.338
Not a, uh, veteran,
a veterinarian.

09:47.463 --> 09:48.756
- Okay, zip it, Doris.
- It was fantastic.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.342
Okay, sorry. Whatever. As long as
you're having fun, good for you.

09:51.509 --> 09:52.677
- Thank you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

09:52.843 --> 09:53.970
Someone's checking us out.

09:54.053 --> 09:55.638
- Yeah, he's checking us out.
- Oh, my goodness.

09:55.805 --> 09:58.057
- Oh, yeah, big time.
- Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

09:58.224 --> 10:00.142
- We're not even at a gay bar!
- That's a lot of man.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.644
It might need
to be a group effort.

10:01.811 --> 10:04.146
Hey, I have to go to the bathroom.
Dom, will you join me?

10:04.313 --> 10:06.482
- Oh, fun.
- Okay.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.359
All right. Have fun.

10:08.526 --> 10:10.152
- Yeah.
- Bye.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.530
I'm glad I bothered
to brush my teeth.

10:12.697 --> 10:15.366
It's-- I think it's--
I don't think it's anything, Paddy.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.743
No, look, it's those little
red bumps right there.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.203
- No, it's--
- I hope it's not bed bugs.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.705
I see it,
but it's not bed bugs,

10:20.871 --> 10:22.081
I think it's just
from scratching.

10:22.248 --> 10:23.416
Leave it alone.
Stop touching it.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.001
It wasn't there this morning,
you know?

10:25.167 --> 10:27.044
We went to that hotel
and then did whatever,

10:27.211 --> 10:29.839
and then we played Top Trumps
on the F line and then--

10:30.006 --> 10:32.717
Top Trumps? Is that like
bumping donuts for tops?

10:32.883 --> 10:35.386
No, it's a British card game
he wanted me to play.

10:35.553 --> 10:37.555
- It was actually really sweet.
- Aww.

10:37.722 --> 10:39.015
It's definitely not AIDS, right?

10:39.181 --> 10:40.725
Oh, come on, you make
everything about AIDS.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.226
I do not make
everything about AIDS.

10:42.393 --> 10:43.769
Oh, remember
gay Channing Tatum?

10:43.936 --> 10:46.564
Well, that was different.
That was a legitimate AIDS situation.

10:46.731 --> 10:49.525
I had just had my wisdom teeth pulled
out and it was totally possible

10:49.692 --> 10:51.277
that my gums hadn't healed
before I blew him.

10:51.444 --> 10:53.571
Was that before or after the time
your asshole was so tight

10:53.738 --> 10:55.406
it sucked the condom
off that guy's dick?

10:55.573 --> 10:57.074
- That really happened!
- Really?

10:57.241 --> 10:59.910
- Yes.
- Listen, have another margarita

11:00.036 --> 11:02.371
and enjoy the evening.
Your AIDS crisis is over.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.040
You're probably right.
I'm crazy.

11:04.206 --> 11:08.085
- Maybe it's just a spider bite?
- Maybe.

11:13.174 --> 11:14.675
Here we go.

11:15.593 --> 11:17.261
- Ah! Another round!
- Oh, God!

11:17.428 --> 11:19.388
- No, I can't do another.
- I'm not paying for this one.

11:19.555 --> 11:20.890
- Why don't you get it?
- Okay.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.725
As soon as I get a job,
I'll get another round,

11:22.892 --> 11:24.643
and I'll get you a new haircut.
Huh? How does that sound?

11:24.810 --> 11:26.604
You know, why don't I
get you a job at the hospital.

11:26.771 --> 11:28.439
But you'd have
to change some catheters,

11:28.606 --> 11:30.066
which actually I think
would be perfect for you,

11:30.232 --> 11:31.567
it would be so real
and gritty and help inspire

11:31.734 --> 11:33.277
your next new body of work.
How about that?

11:33.444 --> 11:35.780
- My art practice is over, so--
- No! Oh, no!

11:35.946 --> 11:37.656
Don't do that to the world!
How cruel!

11:37.823 --> 11:39.033
Fuck you, Hagsville.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.577
You did not just call me
a hag, fag!

11:41.744 --> 11:43.162
- I actually did.
- Did you really?

11:43.329 --> 11:44.955
Hey, hey! Enough
with the hags and fags.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.292
- Unbelievable!
- Is everything okay over here?

11:48.459 --> 11:50.503
Oh, yes. Oh, no, we're good,
thank you for checking.

11:50.669 --> 11:51.921
We're having a heart circle.

11:52.088 --> 11:54.298
We're just, you know, sharing
and being honest with each other.

11:54.465 --> 11:55.633
Oh, it's very healing.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.967
You guys are using
shots of tequila?

11:57.093 --> 11:58.344
- Yeah.
- How'd that work out?

11:58.511 --> 12:01.347
I've been unburdened.
I feel fantastic.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.183
Have we met before?

12:04.350 --> 12:07.311
Um, at the
Symphony Gala maybe?

12:07.478 --> 12:09.438
Um, um...

12:09.605 --> 12:13.275
Uh, yeah, maybe.
Oh, that's totally possible.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.111
How funny, you know,
I actually do, yes.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.362
- Yeah.
- Hi.

12:16.529 --> 12:18.489
- Hi. Malik.
- Hi, I'm Doris.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.616
She's just
so rude sometimes.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.535
I know, she always just says
the first unfiltered thing

12:22.660 --> 12:23.702
that pops into her head,

12:23.869 --> 12:25.579
which, by the way,
is usually wrong.

12:25.663 --> 12:26.747
Oh, I know!

12:26.914 --> 12:28.791
Like the thing she said
about me and Kevin, right?

12:28.958 --> 12:31.168
Technically, we are not
actually having an affair.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.711
Yeah, but you are.
Technically, it is an affair--

12:32.878 --> 12:35.506
No, technically he is having
an affair. Not me.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.007
I don't think that's
exactly true, Paddy.

12:37.174 --> 12:38.884
No, that's completely true.
And also, by the way,

12:39.051 --> 12:41.095
- this has nothing to do with my mom.
- What?

12:41.220 --> 12:43.305
What you said before
about Kevin and my mom.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.391
Oh, that. I mean,
maybe just a little bit.

12:45.558 --> 12:46.976
No, no, no, no, no,
it's not like that anymore.

12:47.143 --> 12:49.520
I genuinely, really,
actually like him.

12:49.687 --> 12:52.356
Which, honestly, it seems like
it's making everything even worse.

12:52.523 --> 12:55.025
And, truly, I also think that
that is why the word "affair"

12:55.192 --> 12:58.195
is starting to feel
kind of shitty to me.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.905
Fuck, maybe Doris was right.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.198
I don't know what
I'm doing right now.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.159
Can you please
tell me what to do?

13:03.325 --> 13:05.035
I'm sorry, Paddy.
I love you, I adore you,

13:05.202 --> 13:06.662
but I can't go on one
of your spirals right now.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.164
Oh, come on.
I just need to talk it out.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.499
No, not tonight. No, I wanna find
Eddie and dance with some bears.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.836
- Find who?
- From the Russian River.

13:14.003 --> 13:15.171
Love you long time.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.714
Are you sure you should
be going out tonight?

13:16.881 --> 13:18.215
Yes.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.229
Hello. Would you
like to get tested?

13:32.396 --> 13:33.522
- Hmm?
- Would you like to get tested?

13:33.689 --> 13:35.024
- Me?
- Yeah.

13:35.191 --> 13:36.567
Uh...

13:38.903 --> 13:41.197
I'm good.
Yeah. Thank you.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.073
Sure.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.083
- I love your shirt.
- Thank you.

14:10.059 --> 14:13.479
Hey! Remember me?
Have you seen Eddie?

14:27.952 --> 14:29.411
Oh!

14:35.125 --> 14:36.919
Oh, my God.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.185
Oh, my God.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.646
Nobody important?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.606
No, Patrick's having
a meltdown tonight.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.359
You just gotta
let him cycle out.

15:00.526 --> 15:01.860
The more he--
you tell him he's okay,

15:02.027 --> 15:04.697
the more he finds reasons
that you're wrong.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.490
That thing with his boss?

15:06.657 --> 15:07.825
Yeah. No, I'm good.

15:07.992 --> 15:09.660
Yeah, he has a little rash.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.996
And he's convinced
that he has AIDS.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.665
I have a good dermatologist.

15:14.832 --> 15:18.002
That doesn't offend you,
irrational AIDS panic?

15:18.168 --> 15:20.629
No, sir.

15:20.796 --> 15:24.300
Jesus, Jack can talk.
I'm exhausted.

15:25.968 --> 15:29.346
Oh, and he wants to know everything
about where you're at.

15:29.513 --> 15:34.977
Your window. I said, "Jack,
why don't you just ask him yourself?"

15:37.813 --> 15:39.523
- Do you miss him?
- Who?

15:39.690 --> 15:44.069
Brian. I saw your photo album
at the house.

15:44.236 --> 15:47.865
He was very handsome.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.036
Of course I miss him.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.829
You guys, um,

15:53.996 --> 15:56.373
you guys remember to turn
off the hot water heater?

15:56.540 --> 15:58.667
Uh, yeah.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.169
Set the alarm?

16:00.336 --> 16:03.213
Yes. We went through
the entire checklist, twice.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.882
Fuck anyone?

16:08.218 --> 16:09.720
Are we really
talking about this?

16:10.095 --> 16:11.430
Well, yeah, why not?

16:11.889 --> 16:13.891
I mean, if we're
going to be open,

16:14.058 --> 16:16.268
there's no space for jealousy.
We-- We talked about this.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.854
I just, I didn't know
we were going into specifics.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.023
Oh, okay.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.358
Did you fuck anyone
on the bedspread?

16:22.441 --> 16:24.234
- Oh!
- The one from Santa Fe,

16:24.401 --> 16:26.070
'cause it's so hard to clean.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.238
No, we didn't
fuck on the bedspread.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.699
- Oh.
- Or on the rug from Turkey.

16:30.866 --> 16:33.952
Or on the beautiful credenza
from Design Within Reach.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.205
Relax.

16:36.372 --> 16:38.540
Relax. I just wanna know
if you had a good time.

16:38.707 --> 16:41.251
- Oh.
- And exactly

16:41.418 --> 16:44.922
what kind of
a good time you had.

16:45.089 --> 16:47.049
- Exactly.
- Really?

16:47.216 --> 16:49.301
And where.

17:01.939 --> 17:04.441
Um, uh...

17:04.608 --> 17:05.818
- Scotty.
- Yeah.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.112
Yeah. How you been, Agustín?
What's up, man?

17:08.278 --> 17:10.989
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm all right,
I'm all right. How are you?

17:11.156 --> 17:13.117
- Uh...
- You look good, you look really--

17:13.242 --> 17:14.660
you look really good.

17:14.827 --> 17:17.287
I heard you and Frank
had a horrible breakup.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.999
Yeah, yeah, it just turns out
we wanted different things, so...

17:21.166 --> 17:25.295
You, uh...
who told you about it?

17:25.462 --> 17:27.715
- Frank.
- Oh.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.926
- You see him much?
- All the time.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.637
Oh. That's cool.

17:33.804 --> 17:37.474
So what's up with you?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.269
Uh, me and some buddies,

17:40.436 --> 17:43.105
we're working on this thing,
uh, out in LA, actually.

17:43.272 --> 17:45.232
- I might head there soon.
- Oh, nice, man.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.484
Yeah.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.611
Hi, can I have
a water, please?

17:49.778 --> 17:51.905
- Here you go.
- Not drinking tonight?

17:52.072 --> 17:56.201
No, GHB doesn't really play well
with others, so...

17:56.994 --> 17:58.495
You mind sharing?

17:58.662 --> 18:00.497
Have you been
drinking tonight?

18:00.664 --> 18:02.833
Stone cold.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.503
Maybe a drop.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.260
- To Dolly.
- Cheers.

18:14.303 --> 18:15.637
Whoo!

18:44.500 --> 18:46.835
I know this guy.

18:49.797 --> 18:52.049
Yo, Agustín!

18:52.216 --> 18:54.551
Yo, man,
wake the fuck up, dude.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.012
Richie! What's up, man?

18:57.179 --> 18:58.347
What's up, man?

18:58.514 --> 18:59.848
You're a fucking mess,
dude, here.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.059
Clean yourself up, dude.

19:03.185 --> 19:06.230
You know it.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.487
- I think he's fine.
- Ugh.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.239
All right.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.032
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

19:18.784 --> 19:20.369
Yo, I know that guy.

19:20.536 --> 19:23.163
- No, you don't, Kyah.
- No, I fuckin' know that guy.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.873
He works at the Chipotle
by the mall.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.875
You think everyone
works at that Chipotle.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.711
No, I think that guy
works at the Chipotle, Brady.

19:29.878 --> 19:32.214
He screws up
my burrito bowls.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.593
<i>There are
some skin conditions</i>

19:36.802 --> 19:40.097
<i>associated with HIV.
But again, I must emphasize.</i>

19:40.222 --> 19:42.724
<i>I can't make any diagnosis of
your condition over the phone.</i>

19:42.891 --> 19:45.018
No, I know you can't diagnose
anything over the phone,

19:45.185 --> 19:47.271
but I was wondering if you had
any scientific data

19:47.396 --> 19:48.564
of my, you know, chances?

19:48.730 --> 19:50.774
<i>Have you had
unprotected anal sex?</i>

19:50.941 --> 19:53.402
No. No, that would
be crazy to do that.

19:53.569 --> 19:57.406
<i>We strongly advise that anyone with
concerns about exposure get tested.</i>

19:57.573 --> 19:59.575
<i>Would you like me to look up
testing sites in your area?</i>

19:59.741 --> 20:01.451
Oh, no, that's okay.
I live in San Francisco,

20:01.618 --> 20:03.078
they give them out
like coffee stirrers.

20:03.245 --> 20:06.039
<i>Great. Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

20:06.874 --> 20:08.876
You have a very comforting voice,
do people tell you that?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.587
It's kind of like
a young Angela Lansbury,

20:11.795 --> 20:13.130
which I don't know
if that makes any sense,

20:13.297 --> 20:14.715
but we were a big
<i>Murder, She Wrote</i> family.

20:14.882 --> 20:17.092
<i>Oh, honey, who wasn't.</i>

20:17.259 --> 20:20.637
Uh, Noelle, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

20:31.481 --> 20:35.068
- Hi.
- Hey, Patrick.

20:37.988 --> 20:39.656
What are you doing here?

20:42.159 --> 20:43.952
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.163
- Paddy.
- Are you okay?

20:46.330 --> 20:47.623
I'm good, brother,
I'm good.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.249
Where did you find him?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.835
He was in SoMa passed out
by a <i>pupusa</i> cart.

20:53.795 --> 20:56.173
All right, onto the bed.

20:56.340 --> 20:59.718
Richie...

21:10.938 --> 21:12.439
What was that?

21:12.606 --> 21:15.525
Nothing, just drunk talk.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.197
So, how's the shop?

21:20.364 --> 21:22.699
Good, busy.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.993
How's work for you?

21:25.160 --> 21:27.204
Complicated.

21:27.371 --> 21:28.872
I'm sorry to hear.

21:29.039 --> 21:31.166
But I really like
the new desks they got us.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.126
I can raise and lower them now,

21:33.251 --> 21:35.879
so I can work standing up
if I want to, which is cool.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.547
Now we both work standing up.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.342
That's right, we do!

21:40.509 --> 21:43.345
You know, they say you're more
productive when you're standing up.

21:43.512 --> 21:46.556
- No shit.
- That's what they say.

21:50.185 --> 21:52.396
Are you seeing anyone?
No.

21:52.562 --> 21:55.649
Mm. Delete, delete, delete.

21:57.234 --> 21:59.361
Are you?

21:59.528 --> 22:01.405
No. I'm...

22:01.613 --> 22:03.240
Uh...

22:03.782 --> 22:05.742
I'm not really
seeing anyone.

22:06.576 --> 22:09.871
So, you're just
barely seeing someone?

22:10.038 --> 22:12.582
No.
I mean I'm not seeing

22:12.749 --> 22:15.502
anyone at all, full stop.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.922
Can we get lunch sometime?

22:20.590 --> 22:23.927
Uh, no,
but thanks for the offer.

22:24.094 --> 22:25.429
I should go, my friends
are waiting for me.

22:25.595 --> 22:26.930
No, just lunch, just lunch.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.432
No agenda,
no expectation of anything,

22:28.557 --> 22:29.599
and it can be
whenever you want.

22:29.725 --> 22:31.893
It can be next week
or next year,

22:32.060 --> 22:34.730
but hopefully
before next year.

22:36.732 --> 22:39.109
I'll think about it.

22:39.276 --> 22:41.862
Okay.
I'll walk you out.

22:42.029 --> 22:44.072
No need.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.199
Thanks for the tea.

22:49.286 --> 22:51.079
Thanks again.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.584
Good night!

23:31.787 --> 23:34.414
- All right, a little prick.
- Okay.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.965
Actually, I have to--
I have to confess something.

23:44.132 --> 23:47.094
I lied on the form outside.

23:47.260 --> 23:50.097
I have had unprotected sex.

23:50.263 --> 23:53.100
- How long ago?
- Uh, six weeks ago.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.310
- Just once?
- Just one time.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.853
And I'm pretty sure
that he's negative.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.648
And when he came--
when he came,

23:59.815 --> 24:03.276
he came, like, on my--
he came on my body.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.779
He didn't cum in my--
in myself.

24:05.946 --> 24:08.115
So I think it should be fine,

24:08.281 --> 24:10.033
and I just, I'm really...

24:10.200 --> 24:12.452
I'm sorry,
I don't know why I did it.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.996
People make mistakes.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.213
So these tests,

24:23.380 --> 24:24.840
they find the virus
pretty quickly now, right?

24:25.006 --> 24:27.050
Oh, we don't actually
test for the virus itself.

24:27.217 --> 24:30.220
We test for your body's
response to the virus.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.972
The way that a pregnancy test

24:32.139 --> 24:33.849
measures your body's
response to a baby.

24:34.015 --> 24:36.893
"Hey, everyone
I'm pregnant... with HIV!"

24:45.569 --> 24:49.072
Tell me what you see.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.581
Hey.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.334
Uh, you can't come in
and tease me like this, Patrick.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.336
- Lunch is still hours away.
- I'm not hungry.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.589
Fantastic. Neither am I.

25:05.755 --> 25:08.925
I lost my appetite when I was
getting my HIV test.

25:10.594 --> 25:11.720
Why were you getting
an HIV test?

25:11.887 --> 25:13.013
Because I freaked out.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.890
Because this is clearly
freaking me out.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.516
- What is?
- This, us.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.894
Sitting in this glass box
pretending we're not fucking.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.770
Okay, hang on.

25:24.107 --> 25:25.567
- What is your status?
- I'm negative.

25:25.734 --> 25:27.652
What about you? I don't even know
if you're positive or negative.

25:27.777 --> 25:29.279
Jesus Christ.
Um, I'm negative, Patrick.

25:29.446 --> 25:30.614
Does that make you
feel any better?

25:30.780 --> 25:32.574
No, actually, it doesn't.

25:32.741 --> 25:36.286
Kevin, what are we doing?

25:38.413 --> 25:39.623
- I don't know.
- Well, I don't know either,

25:39.789 --> 25:41.458
but why do I feel so alone in this?

25:41.625 --> 25:44.252
Well, you're not alone in this,
Patrick, because I'm a fucking mess.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.795
Okay? I'm getting
these migraines,

25:45.962 --> 25:47.923
which I've not had
since I was a kid,

25:48.089 --> 25:51.009
which come to think about it
was the last time I had to hide

25:51.134 --> 25:52.427
how I was feeling.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.471
Well, I'm sorry that
you're having migraines,

25:54.638 --> 25:56.097
but that does make me
feel a little bit better.

25:56.264 --> 25:59.059
Jesus.

25:59.226 --> 26:00.977
You're not alone in this.

26:01.645 --> 26:02.854
Next time you freak out,

26:02.979 --> 26:05.232
don't fucking panic
and have an AIDS test.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.442
Just call me. Okay?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.819
Okay.

26:17.911 --> 26:20.121
I remembered the, um...

26:20.288 --> 26:23.333
the dance moves
to my routine.

26:26.336 --> 26:28.505
- Your routine?
- Mm...

26:28.672 --> 26:31.466
Do you want to see it?

26:31.633 --> 26:34.469
- Now?
- Yeah.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.181
Yeah. Really?

26:38.348 --> 26:39.683
Fuck it.

26:39.849 --> 26:43.311
All right,
this is for you.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.859
Okay, shh.
I need to concentrate.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.319
Okay.

27:09.879 --> 27:13.049
- Wow.
- Thank you. Thank you.

27:13.216 --> 27:15.176
See?

27:15.969 --> 27:19.014
That was worth the wait.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.724
Yes, it was.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.351
God, I feel like a total dick.

27:24.185 --> 27:26.354
I'm sweating.
