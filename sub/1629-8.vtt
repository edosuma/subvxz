what happened.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.575
I know it can't be easy to talk about...

12:32.669 --> 12:33.920
Then let's not, shall we?

12:34.004 --> 12:35.665
The water that cured David
from Dreamshade

12:35.756 --> 12:36.996
connected him to the island.

12:37.090 --> 12:41.003
If he leaves, the connection is broken,
and the poison will kill him.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.425
What if we take
some of the water with us?

12:42.512 --> 12:44.764
That way he stays connected.
He can stay alive in Storybrooke.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.258
For how long?

12:46.350 --> 12:49.558
Once the water runs out,
the Dreamshade will take his life.

12:49.645 --> 12:50.805
Unless there was another cure.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.773
You're suddenly interested
in what I have to say?

12:55.859 --> 12:58.020
Thought I wasn't to be trusted.

12:58.362 --> 13:01.104
You're not. But I'll take my chances.

13:01.323 --> 13:04.781
Well, if you remember, I, too,
was poisoned with Dreamshade

13:04.868 --> 13:07.701
by a cowardly pirate, and yet...

13:07.829 --> 13:10.115
Yes, and we know
how you cured yourself.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.913
With a candle
that takes another person's life.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.331
David is not that selfish.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.533
Oh, how noble.

13:15.003 --> 13:18.120
The point is,
after my near-death experience,

13:18.215 --> 13:20.627
I discovered much about the poison.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.254
I believe I could create an elixir
back in my shop.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.635
What's your price?

13:25.722 --> 13:28.509
Well, this is quite the favor.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.683
I'd expect one of equal weight in return.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.932
No.

When we get back to Storybrooke,

13:36.984 --> 13:39.316
you're gonna save David
because it's the right thing to do.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.860
No deals. No favors. Understand?

13:44.866 --> 13:47.448
Fine. I'll do as you ask.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.573
I'll go tell David.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.575
Pan cast a protection spell.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.827
There has to be a way to break it.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.169
(WHOOSH)

26:28.504 --> 26:29.914
-(WHOOSH)
-Whoa!

26:30.006 --> 26:31.496
NEAL: Careful With that!

26:31.591 --> 26:34.378
Try all you want,
but Pan's magic is too powerful.

26:34.469 --> 26:35.584
At least for you.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.549
(WHOOSH)

26:39.807 --> 26:40.796
What...

26:41.017 --> 26:42.348
How did you do that?

26:42.477 --> 26:45.969
The spell is designed to keep anyone
who casts a shadow from entering.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.189
And you don't have one.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.810
You were telling the truth
about ripping your shadow off.

26:50.193 --> 26:54.027
And Pan knows it.
That's why he cast the spell he did.

26:54.655 --> 26:58.113
This isn't about keeping you out.
It's about drawing me in.

26:58.201 --> 27:01.193
He knows I won't give up the chance
to finish what I came here to do.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.027
You really did come here to save Henry.

27:03.498 --> 27:06.035
I gave you my trust with that box.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.831
Now I need you to give it back.

27:12.673 --> 27:13.662
Hey!

27:18.054 --> 27:19.214
You better come through, Gold,

27:19.680 --> 27:23.889
or I'll make whatever Pan has
planned for you look like child's play.

27:24.185 --> 27:25.265
You understand me?

27:27.230 --> 27:30.313
Well, a simple "good luck"
would have sufficed.

27:45.498 --> 27:46.954
So what are we supposed to do now?

27:47.041 --> 27:49.783
What about the spell
my father used to rip off his shadow?

27:49.877 --> 27:53.335
Do you think if I knew how to do that,
I wouldn't have done it already?

27:53.422 --> 27:55.083
The moon.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.716
The moon?

27:58.845 --> 28:01.336
The moon is what causes
our shadows, right?

28:01.430 --> 28:04.593
What if there was a way
to block it out using magic?

28:04.767 --> 28:06.803
What, you mean, like an eclipse?
Is that even possible?

28:06.894 --> 28:08.225
-Maybe.
-So?

28:08.312 --> 28:09.301
I need help.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.762
With magic?

28:11.941 --> 28:13.852
It requires a lot.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.355
I guess we're about to find out how
much those lessons I gave you paid off.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.776
Follow my lead.

28:34.672 --> 28:36.162
(WHOOSH)

28:46.893 --> 28:50.556
This is it. The place
where you're going to save magic.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.345
Why does it have to be here?

28:52.440 --> 28:54.021
Well, because this is the location

28:54.108 --> 28:56.941
from which Neverland's magic
emanates.

28:59.447 --> 29:00.983
What's the hourglass for?

29:01.115 --> 29:04.653
It marks how much time we have left
before Neverland's magic runs out.

29:04.994 --> 29:05.983
It's almost empty.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.410
Is something wrong?

29:12.168 --> 29:14.659
No. Come with me.

29:20.676 --> 29:24.919
There's something I need to take care of
before we get started, okay?

29:43.699 --> 29:44.984
(CRYING)

29:49.830 --> 29:51.991
What's wrong? Rumple?

29:53.376 --> 29:58.211
Papa! I thought something terrible
had happened to you!

29:58.798 --> 30:01.335
No. No, I'm fine, son.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.963
You don't have to worry about me.

30:09.350 --> 30:11.341
Did you get pixie dust?

30:12.979 --> 30:16.892
Yes. But when I tried using it,
it didn't work.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.564
Why not?

30:19.568 --> 30:21.274
I'm not a boy anymore.

30:21.362 --> 30:22.647
You were right.

30:22.863 --> 30:26.572
Neverland is just for children.
Adults don't belong here.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.989
Then we'll leave
and go somewhere else.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.320
All that matters

30:35.084 --> 30:36.745
is that we're together.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.327
Iwish it was that easy.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.705
But we both know, wherever we go,

30:43.592 --> 30:45.173
I'll go back to my old ways.

30:46.762 --> 30:49.754
I can never be the father
you need me to be.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.465
I'm too weak.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.101
I don't understand.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.766
What are you trying to say?

31:00.109 --> 31:01.974
But there is a way that I can stay here.

31:02.611 --> 31:06.069
A way that I can get the pixie dust
to work here, so I can fly again.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.106
(WHISPERS) Just like it was
when I was a boy.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.281
How?

31:11.954 --> 31:14.491
By letting go of the thing
that is holding me back.

31:15.458 --> 31:16.573
You.

31:16.667 --> 31:17.656

31:18.794 --> 31:20.705

-That's not a monster, Rumple.

31:23.632 --> 31:24.792
It's a friend.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.294
It's part of the island.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.626
And after I do what it told me,
and let you go,

31:28.763 --> 31:30.469
it will become part of me, too.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.421
Don't let him take me!

31:32.516 --> 31:33.722
I don't have a choice.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.470
To stay here,
I have to believe that I'm young again.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.306
And with you here to remind me, I can't.

31:38.606 --> 31:40.813
No, Papa, please! Help me!

31:40.900 --> 31:44.484
A child can't have a child, Rumple.
I'm sorry, but it's true.

31:45.321 --> 31:46.902
Don't fight it!

31:47.448 --> 31:50.565
We both know
that you're better off without me.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.820
I was never meant to be a father.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.040
No!

32:29.990 --> 32:31.526
Hello, laddie.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.024
Oh, I see you've come bearing gifts.

32:36.372 --> 32:37.703
Where's Henry?

32:37.790 --> 32:40.031
Oh, you mean my great-grandson?

32:40.709 --> 32:42.995
You still haven't told the others
who I really am.

32:43.087 --> 32:44.076
(SCOFFS)

32:44.672 --> 32:47.630
Not even your own son. Why?

32:48.509 --> 32:50.465
Because you're nothing
but a coward to me.

32:50.553 --> 32:53.841
We both know, if that were true,
I'd already be in that box.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.218
You don't think I can do it?

32:57.393 --> 33:00.135
You let me inside just to, uh, taunt me?

33:00.229 --> 33:02.971
No. To see you again.

33:03.899 --> 33:06.311
To give you one last chance.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.185
Stay with me.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.239
Let this go.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.357
Let's start over.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.402
Do you think I wanna be with you?

33:19.373 --> 33:22.865
That I could ever forgive you
after you abandoned me?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.367
I'm disappointed, Rumple.

33:25.588 --> 33:30.423
After all these years,
I thought you'd be more understanding.

33:32.261 --> 33:34.923
Considering you did the same thing
to your son.

33:35.222 --> 33:38.385
You traded Baelfire
for the power of a dagger,

33:38.684 --> 33:40.766
and I traded you for youth.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.601
We're a lot more alike
than you'd care to admit.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.190
We are nothing alike!

33:45.274 --> 33:46.684
Oh, of course we are.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.562
And it's nothing to be ashamed of.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.527
Neither one of us
was cut out to be a father, my boy.

33:52.615 --> 33:56.073
I regretted leaving my son
the moment I let him go.

33:56.869 --> 34:00.111
I spent my life trying to find him,
to get him back.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.456
And what did you do?
You forgot about me.

34:04.585 --> 34:06.621
I never forgot about you!

34:07.129 --> 34:09.871
Why do you think
I call myself Peter Pan?

34:09.965 --> 34:13.628
Don't think for a moment
I believe it's because you care for me.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.759
But I do.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.973
And all you have to do
is put down that box,

34:21.602 --> 34:23.638
and you'll see it's true.

34:25.147 --> 34:27.058
We can make the fresh start
you always wanted.

34:27.775 --> 34:31.108
Together. Just as we planned.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.940
Oh, I'm gonna make a fresh start.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.176
You switched them.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.719
Follow the Lady.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.801
Still having trouble believing?

35:06.105 --> 35:10.098
In Neverland, all you have to do
is think of something to have it.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.693
Even something fake.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.935
(CHUCKLES) But the real one,

Oh, it's for the best, Rumple.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.246

Oh. Well, we'll make you another one.

36:25.601 --> 36:26.966

I don't remember
seeing it from my dreams.

37:07.643 --> 37:10.009
That's because it didn't exist.

37:10.312 --> 37:14.225
It was created when
you made the decision to stay here.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.875
But I thought
I was going to stay young forever?

37:35.963 --> 37:39.251
Neverland is a place for children
to visit in their dreams,

37:39.341 --> 37:41.172
not a place for them to live.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.383

40:14.121 --> 40:15.486
It's gonna save all of you.

40:15.622 --> 40:16.828
REGINA: No, it's not.

40:18.500 --> 40:22.914
This was never about magic, Henry.
You have to believe us.

40:23.672 --> 40:26.379
The only person Pan's
interested in saving is himself!

40:26.466 --> 40:27.455
That's not true!

40:27.551 --> 40:29.462
-'Course, it isn't.
-NEAL: Yes, it is!

40:30.637 --> 40:32.252
Pan can't live without you dying.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.087
If you give him your heart,
it's gonna kill you.

40:34.266 --> 40:37.008
They're trying to stem your belief,
Henry. But don't let them.

40:38.562 --> 40:41.474
Remember, every hero gets tested.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.185
Henry.

40:48.447 --> 40:51.939
I know what being a hero
looks like, and this isn't it.

40:52.659 --> 40:53.774
Why would they lie?

40:53.869 --> 40:56.030
Because that's what adults do, Henry.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.908
You know that better than anyone.

41:01.043 --> 41:03.750
Henry, you have to believe us.

41:03.837 --> 41:06.294
Your parents
don't care about Neverland, Henry.

41:06.590 --> 41:10.458
They know if you give your heart
to save it, then you'll have to stay.

41:11.595 --> 41:13.927
And they're being selfish
because they don't wanna lose you.

41:14.014 --> 41:15.629
Henry, you have to trust us.

41:15.724 --> 41:17.055
Trust?

41:17.726 --> 41:20.058
I'm the only one who's ever been
honest with you, Henry.

41:20.896 --> 41:23.603
The only one who ever believed in you.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.065
This is your choice. Not theirs.

41:29.446 --> 41:32.153
But you have to choose now.
We're running out of time.

41:33.909 --> 41:35.194
We believe in you, Henry.

41:35.285 --> 41:36.661
Because we love you.

41:38.372 --> 41:39.657
More than anything.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.204
I love you, too.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.249
-But I have to save magic. I'm sorry.
-No, no, no.

41:48.382 --> 41:49.713
-(THUMPING CONTINUES)
-No!

41:49.800 --> 41:50.789
(SQUISH)

41:50.884 --> 41:53.671
(WHOOSH)

41:56.098 --> 41:58.384
(WHOOSH)

42:00.894 --> 42:02.600
(WHOOSH)

42:09.653 --> 42:10.938
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

42:11.029 --> 42:14.112
(RUMBLING)

42:14.491 --> 42:16.152
Henry!
