00:00.375 --> 00:04.325
The assassin we sent
to kill Delaney is dead.

00:05.250 --> 00:06.750
The British want you dead.

00:06.775 --> 00:09.150
I stitch you up
and you give me information.

00:09.175 --> 00:12.875
I will cede sovereignty of
Nootka Sound to whichever nation

00:12.900 --> 00:14.950
offers me their monopoly.

00:14.975 --> 00:16.675
All the tea in China.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.800
As Horace Delaney's widow,
I also own half of the trading post

00:19.825 --> 00:23.150
at Nootka Sound. And I believe
Nootka is of value to the King.

00:23.175 --> 00:25.150
If you are in contact with the King,

00:25.175 --> 00:26.950
then you are already in grave danger.

00:26.975 --> 00:31.800
I hope I can trust you to keep
the secrets of the past buried.

00:31.825 --> 00:34.600
I am your sister. Let all else lie.

00:34.625 --> 00:37.150
You take the minutes
and you log every meeting.

00:37.175 --> 00:39.100
I want that information.

00:39.125 --> 00:42.950
You think your
father's kid feeds himself?

00:42.975 --> 00:44.625
Now you're back, I want payment.

00:44.650 --> 00:47.600
We were given your name.
I am not a courtesan.

00:47.625 --> 00:48.750
Give her to me!

00:51.425 --> 00:53.625
There appears
to have been a misunderstanding.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.675
She stabbed the Duke of Richmond.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.350
They knew she was not a whore
and that she would fight back.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.850
And now they have
a good reason to come for her.

02:51.625 --> 02:54.000
Open this door, by order of the King!

02:58.025 --> 03:00.725
James! James! They are here!
James, for God's sake!

03:03.125 --> 03:04.250
What's happening?!

03:05.425 --> 03:08.300
They will want you to sign
their papers or you will hang.

03:08.325 --> 03:09.875
Hang for what? Saving my honour?!

03:09.900 --> 03:13.150
You must hold out.
You will hold out. Look at me.

03:13.175 --> 03:15.550
These men are from the Crown.
I will warn the East India

03:15.575 --> 03:18.150
- and they will free you.
- What are you talking about?

03:18.175 --> 03:21.250
You must go with them now.
I will be with you when you're inside

03:21.275 --> 03:22.875
and you will know it.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.400
Hold out.

03:24.425 --> 03:26.875
Hello! Come with us!

03:34.050 --> 03:36.000
I got another one for ya!

03:56.025 --> 03:58.400
Aren't you a pretty one?!

03:59.575 --> 04:00.650
Come on!

04:08.250 --> 04:11.750
This is allocated.
The famous Lorna Bow.

04:13.050 --> 04:15.350
Think of the queue that'll form.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.950
An actress, no less.

04:18.425 --> 04:22.925
No. No! Don't leave me! No, please!

04:31.050 --> 04:32.800
You will answer to God for this.

04:32.825 --> 04:35.300
Probably. And for
the many other evil tasks

04:35.325 --> 04:37.925
I have carried out
for the King of England.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.625
And the Prince Regent.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.625
There was a misunderstanding.
The Duke was given the wrong name.

04:46.650 --> 04:50.750
Each ribbon represents
a reason not to comply.

04:50.775 --> 04:54.050
As each ribbon is untied,
a reason disappears.

04:56.525 --> 04:57.550
Let me explain.

04:57.575 --> 05:01.550
Under English law, as Delaney's
wife, you have the legal right

05:01.575 --> 05:07.000
to contest his will,
on the grounds of insanity.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.250
There's a copy of a marriage
certificate. Horace Delaney.

05:12.450 --> 05:15.750
A legal precedent from 1755.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.600
Now, that is an application
to contest the will,

05:18.625 --> 05:21.100
which we've already drawn up.
The granting of leave

05:21.125 --> 05:23.425
for that application,
by King's Counsel.

05:23.450 --> 05:24.700
Bravo.

05:24.725 --> 05:28.075
And the successful outcome
of that application,

05:28.100 --> 05:31.500
dated one month from now.

05:31.525 --> 05:32.950
Congratulations.

05:36.850 --> 05:37.925
And finally...

05:39.425 --> 05:42.000
an agreement to assign your
share of the Nootka trading post,

05:42.025 --> 05:45.325
smoke house and tanning factory to
the possession of the British Crown.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.200
Or...

06:21.900 --> 06:24.350
a conviction for attempted
murder, for which you hang.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.900
No, this really is terribly simple.

06:30.925 --> 06:34.075
Exposed as you are, in this hell.

06:34.100 --> 06:37.275
You're weak. Men of all kinds.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.600
Your hands shackled.

06:42.525 --> 06:44.700
A key and a pen are your only weapons.

06:44.725 --> 06:47.625
So, you take this pen in your hand,
you sign your name

06:47.650 --> 06:51.000
and I turn the key
and you dress and you leave...

06:55.900 --> 06:59.150
with Ã£1,000 for your trouble.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.750
I have been told...

07:13.775 --> 07:15.800
to await a better offer.

07:20.725 --> 07:22.100
James said...

07:22.125 --> 07:24.525
James?! Oh, James. James.

07:28.500 --> 07:32.725
My God. I see. So soon.

07:33.650 --> 07:34.800
You can go.

07:48.175 --> 07:50.125
My wife is a strange fish.

07:51.250 --> 07:54.675
I talk to her about my work,
when we sit up in bed at night.

07:55.625 --> 08:00.125
Her belief is that James Delaney
is in league with Satan.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.450
I believe that to be true, too.

08:06.700 --> 08:11.275
So, as we... explore ways

08:11.300 --> 08:14.550
to make you change your mind...

08:16.175 --> 08:18.650
these next few hours...

08:22.975 --> 08:25.650
we will be doing God's work.

08:29.900 --> 08:30.950
Hurry up!

08:56.375 --> 08:57.450
Miss Bow.

08:58.925 --> 09:00.950
I can find my own carriage.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.400
Mr. Delaney has business...

09:03.500 --> 09:06.275
but he instructed me
to make sure you get home safely.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.700
Did he say "home"?

09:08.725 --> 09:10.325
I don't quite recall.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.600
Miss Bow, if you please.

09:20.725 --> 09:23.000
We had a fucking agreement!

09:24.175 --> 09:25.950
Common cause!

09:25.975 --> 09:29.825
I saw the papers with my own eyes.
The assignation they were trying to

09:29.850 --> 09:33.075
make her sign gave Nootka
to the Crown and only the Crown.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.275
Fucking snakes!

09:34.300 --> 09:36.301
If we didn't have so much
shit on the Duke of Richmond,

09:36.325 --> 09:38.800
- they would have had her.
- Who tipped you off?

09:38.825 --> 09:40.675
Anonymous note.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.200
Delaney.

09:43.525 --> 09:46.550
He's turning London
into his own private bear pit.

09:47.650 --> 09:50.475
And what are we, the bear or the dogs?

09:53.175 --> 09:54.400
Shit!

09:56.650 --> 10:01.225
And that fat pig
Prince Prinny plays the fool,

10:01.250 --> 10:03.150
so he can better play the game.

10:05.975 --> 10:08.475
I'll pop him. I swear to God.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.475
I'll burst him, like a pig's bladder.

10:14.575 --> 10:16.150
Get a message to Coop.

10:16.175 --> 10:20.475
Tell him we withdraw our negotiators
from the India talks.

10:24.575 --> 10:27.550
The Prince Regent
has decided to decline your offer.

10:27.575 --> 10:31.550
- For crying out loud, Godders.
- He will not offer you a monopoly.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.325
So...

10:41.050 --> 10:43.800
doesn't that mean
the game is up, James?

10:43.825 --> 10:45.825
No, it's just begun.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.150
What else?

10:48.625 --> 10:49.800
The hand was raised.

10:52.375 --> 10:54.475
They talked about gunpowder.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.550
Pettifer said if Delaney
Trading Company wanted to trade

11:02.575 --> 11:04.350
with the Indians at Nootka,

11:04.375 --> 11:08.550
the only merchandise you could
possibly use would be gunpowder.

11:08.575 --> 11:10.875
Wilton pointed out that
in times of war,

11:10.900 --> 11:13.475
the production of gunpowder
is controlled by the Crown.

11:17.975 --> 11:21.325
You will not be granted
a licence to purchase.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.400
Your name is already on a blacklist.

11:27.525 --> 11:30.800
You will not get a single grain
anywhere in England.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.550
So, now...

11:37.975 --> 11:39.250
is the game up?

11:43.775 --> 11:47.200
When they speak of you,
there is such hatred now.

11:47.225 --> 11:48.900
Before, they laughed.

11:48.925 --> 11:51.150
They stopped laughing
out there. That's good.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.925
That's a good thing, Godders.

11:58.925 --> 12:00.000
James.

12:06.850 --> 12:07.925
For God's sake.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.200
The Art Of War.

12:13.175 --> 12:14.625
Poor motive,

12:14.650 --> 12:16.525
poor strategy...

12:18.500 --> 12:20.050
poor outcome.

12:24.825 --> 12:28.450
They can't kill you,
but they will crucify your name...

12:30.650 --> 12:33.050
and crucify all those around you.

12:36.425 --> 12:40.250
But I don't keep anybody around me
that doesn't deserve what they get.

12:42.725 --> 12:44.350
Does that include me?

12:46.825 --> 12:49.475
Yes, that includes you.

12:51.650 --> 12:53.250
Only half a man.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.000
Thank you.

13:03.425 --> 13:08.075
Now, finally, here,
I'm introducing chlorine gas

13:08.100 --> 13:10.425
to a solution of sal ammoniac.

13:10.450 --> 13:14.075
Ladies, beware,
these are corrosive substances.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.000
They will ravage your dresses.

13:17.500 --> 13:21.825
So, the combination produces
a yellow, oily fluid that will

13:21.850 --> 13:26.525
explode with sunlight
or heat or mere motion.

13:27.975 --> 13:32.500
In order to show you most simply
and safely its explosive effect,

13:32.525 --> 13:33.875
I use this instrument...

13:35.925 --> 13:37.250
to transfer...

13:39.500 --> 13:41.350
very carefully...

13:46.025 --> 13:47.150
just a few drops.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.100
And, again, beware.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.450
Use your hand to protect your eyes.

13:57.525 --> 14:00.400
The vessel is often shattered to
atoms, by sheer force.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.150
Terrific! Magnificent!

14:22.975 --> 14:24.050
Mr. Cholmondeley.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.300
I cancelled my appointment.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.100
Blamed a headache.

14:30.125 --> 14:33.075
Exposure to excitable
chemical fumes, I imagine.

14:34.575 --> 14:37.475
As a doctor, I ought to
make sure you're fully recovered.

14:41.325 --> 14:42.550
Something in your eye.

14:45.925 --> 14:47.225
Do you have a husband?

14:47.250 --> 14:48.275
Dead.

14:48.300 --> 14:49.350
Thank God.

14:51.450 --> 14:52.600
What did he look like?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.000
A toad.

15:00.450 --> 15:01.875
I have a question.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.950
It concerns chemistry.

15:03.975 --> 15:06.450
I hope now is not inconvenient.

15:11.775 --> 15:12.800
Wait!

15:12.825 --> 15:15.350
I wrote a fucking book
about chemistry.

15:15.375 --> 15:18.000
If you've got any questions
about chemistry, then read that.

15:18.025 --> 15:20.875
I already did. I was very impressed.
That's why I'm here.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.350
I have a use for you.

15:25.375 --> 15:29.275
You know, semen not ejaculated
at the point of passion

15:29.300 --> 15:31.725
turns to poison and narrows the mind.

15:33.425 --> 15:34.925
Eventually, you become an ape.

15:36.525 --> 15:37.600
So, ejaculate.

15:39.175 --> 15:41.050
Then, we can talk of business.

15:43.450 --> 15:44.850
Is that gold?

15:51.100 --> 15:53.125
Has the semen yet turned to poison?

15:55.425 --> 15:59.000
I believe you invented
a chemical process for verification.

15:59.925 --> 16:01.000
Yeah.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.600
So, what exactly is it you
would use me for?

16:34.450 --> 16:38.050
I got a carpenter to take down
those boards and put up a new door.

16:39.925 --> 16:42.475
You should try a key next time.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.875
They've turned a few things over.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.200
We should bill the King.

16:46.225 --> 16:48.150
- She's back, yes?
- Aye.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.425
How does she seem?

16:50.450 --> 16:51.800
The same.

16:51.825 --> 16:53.525
But then, she's an actress.

16:55.775 --> 16:58.700
You knew they were coming
to take her, didn't you?

16:58.725 --> 17:00.550
All part of the plan.

17:00.575 --> 17:02.200
I have things to do.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.825
We're all just part
of the plan, aren't we, sir?

17:08.849 --> 17:10.474
Buy her some flowers.

17:13.224 --> 17:14.275
Flowers.

17:21.025 --> 17:22.599
You said I'm a weakness.

17:25.025 --> 17:26.550
I wasn't weak.

17:27.575 --> 17:28.900
I will fix that.

17:28.925 --> 17:30.925
I'll get Brace to fix that.

17:33.850 --> 17:36.150
In the cell, I called you "James".

17:37.725 --> 17:39.800
I think that surprised them most.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.300
Certainly surprised me.

17:41.325 --> 17:44.600
If your intervention
had been ten minutes later,

17:44.625 --> 17:46.325
I would have been raped.

17:47.825 --> 17:50.750
But the consequence for you
was worth the risk to me, yes?

17:51.700 --> 17:53.350
You see me as I am.

17:53.375 --> 17:56.075
All of those that I gather are damned.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.700
It's just part
of a company policy of mine.

17:58.725 --> 18:01.900
Perhaps now you will understand
why it is better for you to leave

18:01.925 --> 18:04.000
and let this business run its course.

18:04.025 --> 18:07.300
Is that why you let it happen?
To teach me a lesson?

18:07.325 --> 18:10.500
No. That was to teach the King
a lesson. And the Company.

18:10.525 --> 18:14.125
But if you're absolutely
resolute on staying...

18:15.425 --> 18:19.125
then I may agree to incorporate
you into the organisation.

18:20.525 --> 18:22.100
Oh.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.150
Oh, I see.

18:23.175 --> 18:25.150
I've passed a test.

18:25.175 --> 18:26.250
No.

18:29.050 --> 18:31.100
I will join the League of the Damned.

18:31.125 --> 18:33.275
A group of people
who are drawn together,

18:33.300 --> 18:36.200
with a willingness
to do exactly as I say.

18:42.025 --> 18:44.450
We are the ships, you are the river.

18:46.975 --> 18:50.825
First, I need you to bring me a trunk

18:50.850 --> 18:52.750
full of my father's belongings.

18:57.825 --> 19:02.300
I'm actually very tired, Mr. Delaney.

19:02.325 --> 19:05.550
Your conspiracies
have made it a very tiring day.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.750
I'll fix that. Sleep on it.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.350
Deliver us from evil,

21:01.375 --> 21:03.550
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,

21:03.575 --> 21:05.475
for ever and ever. Amen.

21:10.775 --> 21:13.675
John Company and the King
are back at war.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.800
The resolution again recedes.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.325
Fuck him!

21:19.975 --> 21:21.050
You woke me.

21:27.450 --> 21:30.450
Please don't. Your coat's all wet.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.150
And you're wet, too.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.925
Who's in there?

21:46.300 --> 21:47.750
Who's in there?

21:50.050 --> 21:53.125
Where he leads, I will follow.

23:05.525 --> 23:07.100
Where the fuck are we?

23:07.125 --> 23:08.750
My new factory.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.900
I flagged him down at St Pancras.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.750
I told him two shillings.
I guessed you'd pay.

23:23.525 --> 23:24.600
Hold on.

23:32.775 --> 23:33.850
Nitrous oxide.

23:35.225 --> 23:36.700
They call it "laughing gas".

23:36.725 --> 23:40.500
I provide it for entertainment
at society parties.

23:40.525 --> 23:41.600
It's good money.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.525
Last night, it was, eh...

23:45.850 --> 23:48.275
Oh, fuck, I can hardly remember.

23:48.300 --> 23:53.025
Duck hunters and whores
dressed as ducks... I think.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.750
I had to partake of my own supply,
just to get through it.

23:55.775 --> 23:56.850
Pweugh!

23:58.050 --> 24:01.325
Anyway... show me this cow shit.

24:11.100 --> 24:12.525
Hmm...

24:14.500 --> 24:15.800
Pigeon shit?

24:24.325 --> 24:25.425
Yeah, it's better.

24:25.450 --> 24:27.050
Now... wood.

24:29.125 --> 24:31.350
<i>Some birch, but it is mostly hazel.</i>

24:32.850 --> 24:34.200
Oak is better.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.675
There's not enough oak
on the heath, dear boy.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.400
So, buy offcuts from the shipyard.

24:39.425 --> 24:41.650
Nothing we use
can be purchased openly.

24:44.225 --> 24:45.875
What about piss?

24:45.900 --> 24:46.900
I'm sorry?

24:46.925 --> 24:49.825
Human urine's by far
the best for leaching the ash.

24:49.850 --> 24:52.300
Especially if there
are traces of alcohol.

24:52.325 --> 24:55.025
How many humans live here?

24:55.050 --> 24:56.325
Three.

24:57.650 --> 25:00.400
- Where are they, by the way?
- I sent them away this morning.

25:00.425 --> 25:02.150
Do you own this farm?

25:03.250 --> 25:06.800
Ask no more questions now
and talk to me only of chemistry.

25:13.300 --> 25:16.725
My simple question is,
is it possible to achieve it here?

25:18.125 --> 25:20.350
If you mix the pigeon shit
and the cow shit

25:20.375 --> 25:23.950
at a ratio of around 60:40
in favour of the pigeon.

25:23.975 --> 25:25.700
I'd have to do tests.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.400
Then, if you burnt
all that stack of wood today,

25:28.425 --> 25:30.800
you could soak the ash
in 50 gallons of human piss

25:30.825 --> 25:32.901
and leave it for a minimum
of a year. Then, my friend,

25:32.925 --> 25:35.150
you would, indeed, have gunpowder.

25:36.325 --> 25:37.875
I don't have a year.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.500
Well, I have a theory that the
introduction of several barrels

25:40.525 --> 25:43.600
of saltpetre that have already been
refined at the start of the process

25:43.625 --> 25:46.400
can cut the leaching stage
down to four weeks.

25:47.725 --> 25:48.750
"Theory"?

25:48.775 --> 25:50.875
Yes, but my theories are always right.

25:52.425 --> 25:55.000
As far as I know, there is
only one place where one can find

25:55.025 --> 25:57.600
- refined saltpetre.
- Two.

25:58.975 --> 26:02.900
The bat caves of Burma,
where the bat shit refines itself,

26:02.925 --> 26:06.300
or the warehouse of the
East India Company at Wapping Wall.

26:06.325 --> 26:09.350
Except, they're not selling,
at the moment.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.625
War going on.

26:11.650 --> 26:13.325
Two wars, actually.

26:14.725 --> 26:16.925
Or have we already won one of them?

26:18.250 --> 26:20.050
You're hired, Mr. Cholmondeley.

26:21.325 --> 26:23.875
And as for your saltpetre,
I will get it for you.

26:45.375 --> 26:46.450
Hm?

28:49.125 --> 28:50.525
He's the one.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.475
Who are you?

30:04.050 --> 30:07.075
I told your friends...

30:07.100 --> 30:09.125
Nootka Sound is not for sale.

30:32.825 --> 30:34.450
Come on, then.

32:19.025 --> 32:21.150
How the hell can you walk around
a house this old

32:21.175 --> 32:22.425
without making a noise?

32:22.450 --> 32:25.350
Because I own it, and I know
every creak in it

32:25.375 --> 32:28.475
and I can move around it
without waking it up.

32:30.625 --> 32:33.800
When was the last time you set foot
inside a church, sir?

32:40.325 --> 32:44.275
The lady asked me to wake her
because she had a costume fitting.

32:44.300 --> 32:47.150
I guessed you wouldn't want
her going out.

32:47.175 --> 32:50.625
No, the lady is free to come and go
as she pleases.

32:50.650 --> 32:53.275
The Crown will protect her
from the Company.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.075
And the Company will protect her
from the Crown.

33:00.025 --> 33:02.950
- And you are the joint in the seesaw.
- Mm.

33:02.975 --> 33:06.475
By the way, I found your red roses
in the mud

33:06.500 --> 33:09.500
when I threw out the oyster shells.

33:09.525 --> 33:11.900
- Who's this?
- Who the hell's what?

33:11.925 --> 33:16.275
Brace, do not believe
that I will not know

33:16.300 --> 33:18.475
when you reseal my letters.

33:20.850 --> 33:24.300
Countess Musgrove is,
let me think, sir...

33:24.325 --> 33:29.275
1,550 places above you
in the social hierarchy of London.

33:29.300 --> 33:33.150
Her husband is a little, fat
German prick and she fucks...

33:34.450 --> 33:35.725
You forgot to wake me.

33:36.825 --> 33:38.600
Fucks what, Brace?

33:40.525 --> 33:44.875
Countess Musgrove has a reputation
as a lady of uncertain origin, sir,

33:44.900 --> 33:49.475
who in the past used her beauty
to beguile men of great influence,

33:49.500 --> 33:53.300
thereby improving her position
in society.

33:53.325 --> 33:57.125
She also allows and even encourages
the closed and turning waltz.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.150
A ball.

34:02.500 --> 34:05.025
And why would she invite
a man who cannot dance?

34:05.050 --> 34:07.725
Perhaps she likes oddities
and curiosities.

34:10.225 --> 34:12.824
Or if she knows you're in the house
in the light,

34:12.850 --> 34:17.199
you cannot be outside lurking in the
garden in the dark scaring people.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.275
There is another letter, sir.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.275
Perhaps related to the first.

34:24.300 --> 34:27.275
- This came from the same post?
- Aye, sir.

34:31.650 --> 34:34.750
The Americans.
Wanting a place on the seesaw.

34:39.025 --> 34:42.925
Well, it is an invitation for two.
Miss Bow?

34:45.100 --> 34:46.600
Do you dance?

35:04.975 --> 35:06.400
Where is she?

35:08.825 --> 35:10.600
Where's Helga?

35:10.625 --> 35:11.675
I'll get her.

35:25.925 --> 35:27.875
Winter said you looked impressed.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.925
I am.

35:32.975 --> 35:34.725
Oysters mask the smell of sex.

35:40.850 --> 35:42.550
You like that.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.150
Mm.

35:45.925 --> 35:48.825
Yes, I might have a use for that,
actually.

35:48.850 --> 35:51.825
You may need to bring a couple of
girls to the Dolphin with you.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.675
Now, shut for the evening.

35:55.325 --> 35:56.875
You're busy tonight.

36:00.050 --> 36:03.700
Right, a request to hire men
and boats to collect barrels

36:03.725 --> 36:05.750
from the Prospect of Whitby pub

36:05.775 --> 36:09.275
and ferry them up the Fleet River
to Hampstead.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.350
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

36:11.650 --> 36:13.100
Barrels will contain...

36:14.650 --> 36:16.700
whores' urine.

36:16.725 --> 36:20.075
And that of the customers.
Thruppence a barrel.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.900
I want you to sign that right now

36:21.925 --> 36:24.325
before whatever it is
in your blood wears off.

36:27.450 --> 36:29.075
And I'm planning a robbery.

36:30.375 --> 36:33.400
At last. Back in the world of
reason and rationality.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.725
Who are we going to rob?

37:08.575 --> 37:10.225
Elizabeth.

37:10.250 --> 37:12.000
Violet.

37:13.850 --> 37:15.950
- And Mary.
- Thank you so much.

37:17.325 --> 37:19.675
Now, if you will excuse me, ladies.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.475
Come on.

38:08.900 --> 38:10.675
Posy for the lady?

38:15.250 --> 38:16.925
Much obliged, kind sir.

38:21.025 --> 38:22.525
For you.

38:24.425 --> 38:29.675
There's other business afoot
tonight, none of which concerns you.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.350
Miss Lorna Bow.

39:08.225 --> 39:10.825
Mrs. Lorna Delaney.

39:10.850 --> 39:12.925
And Mr. James Delaney.

39:16.700 --> 39:20.200
Judging by the horror on the faces
of the ladies, you are known.

39:20.225 --> 39:22.625
Yes, and judging by the shame
on the face of some of the men,

39:22.650 --> 39:23.675
so are you.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.275
Oh, if only I had been a whore,

39:25.300 --> 39:27.675
I might have been as rich
as Countess Musgrove,

39:27.700 --> 39:29.650
who I presume is that creature.

39:33.125 --> 39:36.000
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

39:36.025 --> 39:38.750
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

39:38.775 --> 39:40.750
Hello. Not hello.

39:42.450 --> 39:44.600
- Who the hell is that?
- I've no idea.

40:08.825 --> 40:10.625
And who the hell was that?

40:39.375 --> 40:42.625
- Why are you here?
- Because I was invited. You?

40:42.650 --> 40:46.075
Because my husband was invited.
He has business of theirs in Berlin.

40:46.100 --> 40:49.900
Ah, but it is a bit unexpected,
isn't it? It's unusual.

40:49.925 --> 40:52.275
I knew that when you saw me,
you would come to me

40:52.300 --> 40:54.225
and I realise
that is how it always is.

40:54.250 --> 40:55.450
You always drive me...

40:55.475 --> 40:58.600
It is a bit unexpected that we
were both invited, is it not?

40:59.900 --> 41:02.550
That we were invited, both together.

41:02.575 --> 41:06.075
And if they invited us both,
then they probably know.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.150
Who knows?

41:09.050 --> 41:10.125
Who knows?

41:11.225 --> 41:13.075
Our American friends.

41:13.100 --> 41:16.800
Ah! You feel me, don't you,
when I break in?

41:16.825 --> 41:19.000
- No.
- Yes, you do.

41:19.025 --> 41:21.025
- No.
- You do. You feel me.

41:21.050 --> 41:24.125
And I could come more often,
but I spare you.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.075
Then spare me.

41:28.925 --> 41:30.300
I went to a doctor,

41:30.325 --> 41:33.025
he took me to a priest who had been
to a mission in Africa.

41:33.050 --> 41:37.125
- Yes, what did he say?
- He said that you visit as animals.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.400
He couldn't even look at me
after I'd told him.

41:41.425 --> 41:45.875
When I left England,
I thought I was mad,

41:45.900 --> 41:48.925
but they taught me how to use it.
Now it's a gift.

41:50.225 --> 41:51.800
It's the devil.

41:53.650 --> 41:58.200
Now, amongst other things,
I am also a doctor.

41:58.225 --> 42:00.075
And I'd say the lady is in danger

42:00.100 --> 42:02.600
of catching more than
just a chill out here.

42:03.625 --> 42:05.550
Your half-sister. Am I right?

42:13.525 --> 42:17.000
You're quite a prize, Mr. Delaney,
quite a prize.

42:20.175 --> 42:22.600
I was told what you did
to our first resort.

42:24.525 --> 42:26.000
Opened him up like a bull.

42:27.725 --> 42:28.800
Nice work.

42:30.325 --> 42:33.750
Now, I make no moral judgments.

42:33.775 --> 42:37.675
And besides, Carlsbad said to say
that you can have her.

42:38.725 --> 42:40.900
You can have her as part of the deal.

42:40.925 --> 42:42.750
Part of our second offering.

42:42.775 --> 42:45.200
So why don't you just take her?

42:47.175 --> 42:48.800
Just take her with you.

42:48.825 --> 42:50.475
No more hiding.

42:52.125 --> 42:56.075
We can guarantee you safe passage,
anonymity...

42:57.375 --> 42:58.700
new worlds.

42:58.725 --> 43:01.425
But look, if you don't want
to deal with the obstacle,

43:01.450 --> 43:03.475
we can certainly take care
of that for you.

43:03.500 --> 43:06.875
Say her husband gets drunk.
No surprise. Falls from a bridge

43:06.900 --> 43:08.050
or something.

43:10.450 --> 43:12.100
Let me just make the point...

43:12.125 --> 43:15.400
from an American point of view.

43:16.725 --> 43:21.800
Love is now part of the deal
that we are offering

43:21.825 --> 43:25.475
over and above that which is
on offer from your countrymen.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.075
Hm?

43:30.450 --> 43:31.925
I'll leave that with you.

43:37.025 --> 43:40.125
And don't worry
how we know so much. Hm?

43:42.225 --> 43:43.550
We just know so much.

44:19.575 --> 44:23.225
I were stowed'way from India
on the Fairlie.

44:23.250 --> 44:27.000
And I'm full with thirst
and the temptations of the Tropics

44:27.025 --> 44:29.250
and have a great need to ease 'em.

45:04.700 --> 45:07.150
Pearl's good, isn't she?

45:34.500 --> 45:37.000
Get in, come on, get in.

46:10.425 --> 46:12.075
Good evening.

46:13.325 --> 46:16.200
I'm just a complete stranger,
plying my wares,

46:16.225 --> 46:20.075
offering the gift of hysteria
before the night is over.

46:27.325 --> 46:29.400
That stranger that you've never met,

46:29.425 --> 46:31.875
is he part of your
League of the Damned?

46:36.225 --> 46:38.125
Well, we could at least try?

46:40.625 --> 46:42.000
Sorry.

46:42.025 --> 46:43.925
- Would you like to dance?
- No.

46:49.725 --> 46:51.950
Careful. Careful.

46:51.975 --> 46:53.350
He said a few drops.

46:53.375 --> 46:55.125
Give it here. Give it here.

46:57.050 --> 46:58.725
Get back. Get back. Get back.

47:05.700 --> 47:06.950
Get the saltpetre!

47:06.975 --> 47:09.400
Keep moving.

47:11.900 --> 47:13.925
Keep moving. Two more.

47:17.250 --> 47:18.800
Come on, keep moving.

47:18.825 --> 47:20.700
Right. Come on, go, go, go, go, go!

47:20.725 --> 47:23.475
Move, move! Get out! Go!

47:39.725 --> 47:41.800
You know James Delaney?

47:41.825 --> 47:43.400
No.

47:43.425 --> 47:47.925
What? You mean in the way that
no-one really knows James Delaney?

47:49.175 --> 47:50.525
Yes.

47:50.550 --> 47:52.300
I've only not known
James a little while.

47:52.325 --> 47:56.150
But I have the feeling you've not
known him a little longer.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.350
- We were children...
- Oh!

48:05.650 --> 48:06.925
Thank you.

48:08.250 --> 48:12.100
If I were to have intentions
regarding James,

48:12.125 --> 48:13.800
would I need to be wary of you?

48:19.975 --> 48:23.725
No civilised woman would have
intentions regarding him.

48:25.625 --> 48:27.900
And you would not need
to be wary of me.

48:27.925 --> 48:29.725
We have the same father.

48:48.725 --> 48:52.600
You are in every way an unopened box.

48:54.650 --> 48:58.150
Just when I think it's empty,
I hear a tiger roaring inside it.

48:59.975 --> 49:03.925
I want you to bring the trunk with
my father's belongings tomorrow.

49:05.775 --> 49:07.525
I thought you might have gone.

49:10.175 --> 49:12.425
Oh, you mean you waited? For me?

49:12.450 --> 49:14.425
No...

49:14.450 --> 49:17.100
I wanted to finish my pipe.

49:17.125 --> 49:20.550
I want you to bring my father's
possessions tomorrow

49:20.575 --> 49:24.850
- or our association is finished.
- James Delaney?

49:25.825 --> 49:28.150
The Countess Musgrove.

49:28.175 --> 49:29.900
I don't dance.

49:29.925 --> 49:32.850
A gentleman called Colonnade
told me that you do.

49:39.525 --> 49:42.750
As hostess, I thought
I would dance the outrageous dance

49:42.775 --> 49:45.000
with an outrageous guest.

49:45.025 --> 49:46.475
Yet I do not dance, madam.

49:47.775 --> 49:50.675
Well, then we shall disappear.
Come on.

49:52.450 --> 49:55.550
The Countess Musgrove.

49:57.975 --> 50:00.125
Just do as I do and all will be well.

50:04.900 --> 50:11.500
As a rule, I do this trick
with a beautiful woman...

50:11.525 --> 50:14.000
Ooh!

50:14.025 --> 50:16.275
and a chimpanzee.

50:17.500 --> 50:23.250
In the absence of a chimpanzee,
a gorilla will have to do.

50:28.625 --> 50:31.500
Please, madam, please, sir,

50:31.525 --> 50:33.200
take a deep breath...

50:36.375 --> 50:39.350
and step into the beyond.

50:56.050 --> 50:59.350
One wonders if they will ever
be seen again!

51:03.125 --> 51:05.000
I did my research on you.

51:05.025 --> 51:07.200
Genevieve Decoux.

51:07.225 --> 51:09.025
From New Orleans.

51:09.050 --> 51:11.550
Please, Mr. Delaney,
we do not have much time.

51:13.025 --> 51:15.100
You sent the giant to kill me?

51:15.125 --> 51:18.525
The outcome persuaded us
you should be courted instead.

51:19.725 --> 51:22.825
What will the gorilla do
with the lady, one wonders.

51:22.850 --> 51:24.350
Eat her, perhaps!

51:28.825 --> 51:31.000
Oh, where did they go?

51:31.025 --> 51:34.825
Countess, I know this is business.

51:34.850 --> 51:36.750
And I think I know who you are.

51:37.900 --> 51:39.275
But know this.

51:40.725 --> 51:43.100
I control the timing of this.

51:43.125 --> 51:45.350
At all times
your life is in our hands.

51:45.375 --> 51:47.475
As is your name in mine.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.125
Carlsbad.

51:54.500 --> 51:57.600
Oh, it seems we have one...

51:57.625 --> 51:59.350
but not the other...

51:59.375 --> 52:03.425
Where is my gorilla?
Get back in there, Lady Musgrove,

52:03.450 --> 52:06.600
and find that humping gorilla
of yours.

52:09.325 --> 52:12.875
I was told you wanted tea. A monopoly.

52:12.900 --> 52:15.800
- Fanciful, of course.
- Hm.

52:17.500 --> 52:20.175
I want to meet with
the Embassy in Paris.

52:20.200 --> 52:21.300
Oh, no.

52:21.325 --> 52:24.700
You assign to the United States,
where someone will kill you.

52:24.725 --> 52:28.025
This time, we will be more artful.

52:28.050 --> 52:31.075
Hm! You will need to be.

52:38.625 --> 52:41.725
Your own sister. Oh, goodness!

53:24.250 --> 53:26.200
Is he here?

53:28.375 --> 53:29.750
Is this real?

53:29.775 --> 53:32.750
Why's he here? Is it him?
You should get away.

53:34.225 --> 53:35.275
Why is he here?

53:51.050 --> 53:53.000
You fu... you fucked her!

53:54.575 --> 53:55.950
He fucked her.

53:55.975 --> 53:57.400
He fucked her!

53:58.850 --> 53:59.925
He fu...

54:27.375 --> 54:29.350
You need some air.

54:31.225 --> 54:32.875
James. Please, don't.

54:47.925 --> 54:49.250
James?

54:50.775 --> 54:52.550
James?

54:52.575 --> 54:55.450
You call this thing James?

54:59.050 --> 55:02.325
You don't call him anything
but nigger!

55:08.450 --> 55:10.275
You fucked her.

55:10.300 --> 55:14.050
And you lay your hands on me
in <i>my</i> society!

55:17.850 --> 55:19.950
I know I will have my satisfaction.

55:21.825 --> 55:22.875
I declare it!

55:24.450 --> 55:26.950
I challenge James Delaney to a duel.

55:28.325 --> 55:31.275
At dawn... to the death.

55:33.575 --> 55:35.100
To the death.

55:35.125 --> 55:36.650
Do you accept?

55:39.450 --> 55:41.150
Do you accept?!
