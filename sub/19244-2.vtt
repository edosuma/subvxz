00:21.271 --> 00:24.649
-[animals calling]
-[crickets chirping]

00:28.153 --> 00:29.738
Guess what Kelly told me last night?

00:29.821 --> 00:34.200
She and Ben are selling their home.
It's a beautiful property.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.870
Great location, new kitchen,
marble countertops.

00:36.953 --> 00:41.499
Detached bonus room.
I think they'll give us the listing.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.044
Joel, sweetheart.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.631
[panting] The listing.
That'd be great, honey.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.384
We can't be realtors
if we don't have listings.

00:51.468 --> 00:55.472
It's so basic. It's so fucking basic.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.813
[grunting]

01:05.774 --> 01:07.358
[Sheila] Oh, my... [grunts]

01:09.819 --> 01:12.697
-Would've been nice to have the lid.
-[grunts] I couldn't find it.

01:12.781 --> 01:13.615
Right. [grunts]

01:15.700 --> 01:17.994
You'd think it would've been stored
with the container, is all.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.038
I can look for it
when we get home, sweetheart.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.165
When we get home?

01:22.248 --> 01:23.416
What good would the lid be

01:23.500 --> 01:25.835
when our container is stuffed
with half a fucking body,

01:25.919 --> 01:29.005
and is buried
in the fucking desert... honey?

01:30.632 --> 01:34.552
-You're swearing a lot tonight.
-Yeah, I've noticed that too.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.639
Well, obviously, sweetie, I didn't know
we'd be burying the container.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.891
What did you think, honeybunch?

01:39.974 --> 01:43.228
We'd take it home with us and clean it out
and use it to store our taxes,

01:43.311 --> 01:45.313
which we can't do
because it doesn't have a fucking lid.

01:45.396 --> 01:48.942
-Fine, I won't look for it.
-Oh, shit. Someone's coming.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.152
-[vehicle approaching]
-Oh, crap!

01:52.612 --> 01:54.864
-Who could be out here?
-I don't know.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.450
-Hurry. Let's get this in the ground.
-[gasps] Okay.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.995
-[Sheila grunts]
-Aah!

02:03.081 --> 02:05.166
[gasps]

02:06.960 --> 02:08.795
Do not bring up the lid.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.632
Come on, scoop this up,
get it in the hole.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.092
[grunting and panting]

02:14.175 --> 02:15.593
[Joel groans]

02:15.677 --> 02:17.387
-We can't get caught.
-I know.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.389
Who will take care of Abby?
We can't leave Abby.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.890
I know.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.143
[panting and grunting]

02:27.147 --> 02:28.857
[Joel] Hurry, get up.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.610
Act casual.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.154
[car engine shuts off]

02:37.407 --> 02:39.868
Really? This is what we're doing?

02:40.618 --> 02:44.330
Okay, we say we came across this
murder site and we're just cleaning it up.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.250
-Who cleans up murder sites?
-I don't know. We're Mormons.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.628
-Mormons don't clean up murder sites.
-Mormons are helpful.

02:52.755 --> 02:53.965
Yeah, I'm just not seeing it.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.385
Yaaah!

02:57.468 --> 02:59.804
-Joel, no!
-Dad, stop!

02:59.888 --> 03:01.264
[yelling stops]

03:01.806 --> 03:02.974
Oh.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.436
Abby, what are you doing here?

03:06.519 --> 03:09.480
I saw the broken toaster in the yard,
and there was blood on the lawn,

03:09.564 --> 03:11.232
and no one was home,
and I didn't know what was happening.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.235
So she came to me for help.
I'm pretty calm in a crisis.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.696
Eric borrowed his stepdad's car.

03:17.196 --> 03:19.032
Please don't tell Dan. He loves this car.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.617
Keeps it covered with a blanket
in the garage,

03:20.700 --> 03:22.619
which is how I'll end up
if he finds out I took it.

03:22.702 --> 03:26.122
-[sighs] How did you find us?
-You put that tracker app on our phones.

03:26.205 --> 03:30.752
Oh, yeah, that thing's great.
So I guess we'll see you at home, then.

03:32.670 --> 03:38.259
-Oh, my God, did you kill someone?
-No! Jesus! We were out for a drive...

03:38.343 --> 03:40.011
Yes, I did.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.972
Okay, we're not gonna lie.
Would've been good to know.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.976
He was not a good man, Abby.
He didn't listen to my words.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.521
-[belches] Stay down, Gary.
-But you only ate some of him?

03:50.605 --> 03:52.732
He weighed, like, 180 pounds.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.860
Ah, the undead equivalent
of over-ordering.

03:57.612 --> 04:01.658
Honey, I did not want to get you
or your dad involved in this.

04:01.741 --> 04:06.704
[scoffs] Your mom is a monster.
I ate someone.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.832
And if you want me to go away, I will.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.421
No one's going anywhere.

04:20.009 --> 04:21.010
Yeah.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.601
Sorry. The less time spent
at a crime scene, the better.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.436
What do you know about it?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.773
My stepdad's a cop
and I enjoy the Internet,

04:33.856 --> 04:36.109
and the first thing about crime
is you don't wanna get caught.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.487
-Did this guy have a family?
-No.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.948
-He moved here, like, a week ago.
-[Eric] Perfect.

04:42.031 --> 04:45.118
Uh, you didn't eat his keys, did you?

04:47.495 --> 04:49.706
[pop song plays]

05:10.393 --> 05:13.521
We toss Gary's bag, drive his car
to Burbank, and leave it at the airport.

05:13.604 --> 05:16.441
Guy like Gary, hopefully,
people will just think he skipped town.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.984
That's ingenious.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.487
We should be ingenious more often.
It's kinda fun.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.114
I disagree.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.409
In fact, until we solve whatever this is,
I'd like you to meet me halfway.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.120
At least, control some of your impulses.

05:29.203 --> 05:34.042
-I swear, I did not have sex with Gary.
-I believe you.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.878
But I did eat his balls.

05:38.504 --> 05:42.216
Well, one of them.
Does that count as meeting you halfway?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.762
What I meant was,
it'd be good for everyone

05:45.845 --> 05:47.722
if, from now on,
you only ate chicken or beef.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.433
Oh, yeah. Okay, totally, I agree.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.518
And we need to return the Range Rover.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.900
-Sheila?
-Fine.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.362
I should've eaten both of his balls.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.531
It'd be great if we didn't talk
about Gary's balls anymore.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.493
Sure. They were tiny anyway.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.538
What? I thought you'd like that.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.505
This will mask any traces of blood.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.758
But tell your dad to dilute it
three-to-one or he'll kill his lawn.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.887
-Intense night, huh?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.057
Thank you, Eric.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.272
"Thank you, Eric."

06:41.150 --> 06:43.319
[pump clicking]

06:43.402 --> 06:45.655
[spray hissing]

06:48.199 --> 06:50.243
[pump clicking]

06:52.578 --> 06:54.580
[spray hissing]

07:03.840 --> 07:06.551
Carl called. He's mad
because he can't find Gary.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.262
Because he's, you know,
buried half-eaten in the desert,

07:09.345 --> 07:12.682
without a lid,
which I did find, by the way.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.267
I found something, too.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.520
Not as exciting as a lid without a box,
but maybe more useful.

07:17.603 --> 07:21.315
There's a virologist at City College
who specializes in rare viruses.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.483
I'm gonna go see him,

07:22.567 --> 07:24.944
get a second opinion
from someone who's not 16.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.362
Okay. That's great, honey.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.199
But why didn't you tell me that Gary stole
the Peterson listing from us?

07:30.825 --> 07:33.286
Well, there was a lot going on,
what with you killing him.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.705
Well, that couple is going back
to the house today,

07:35.788 --> 07:38.833
and Carl said if Gary doesn't turn up,
which he won't,

07:38.916 --> 07:41.461
or, at least, not enough of him
to show a house,

07:41.544 --> 07:43.379
he wants us to do it.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.839
This is good.

07:44.922 --> 07:48.301
We should get our lives back to normal
anyway, so no one gets suspicious.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.637
-Why not show a house?
-I agree. I'm gonna get dressed and go.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.183
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-What? You're going to see the virus guy.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.477
I'll pick you up after,
and we'll go to the house together.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.520
Don't you trust me?

07:59.604 --> 08:02.356
Well, you did disembowel a man
and buy a Range Rover yesterday.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.735
-Speaking of the Range Rover...
-Which we have to return.

08:05.818 --> 08:09.780
It can't be returned. [chuckles]
State law.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.408
New automobile sales are final.

08:12.492 --> 08:17.246
Damn you, California,
for making us own such a super nice car.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.833
Don't worry, Joel.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.379
We're gonna sell
the Peterson house... together.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.465
We really need to now.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.550
I love you, Joel.

08:29.926 --> 08:30.760
[kiss smacks]

08:30.843 --> 08:32.970
Thank you for being my husband.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.432
I love you too, Sheila.
We're gonna figure this out.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.767
Yeah, but later.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.354
'Cause right now, I want to hump
like a rescue dog at a Rite Aid.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.566
Hey, porn stars.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.984
-Oh.
-Gah.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.362
Dan's in the backyard
looking at our grass.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.822
-A good development? I don't think so.
-I'll go see what's up.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.785
-Are you okay, sweetheart?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.287
I'm 16. I can deal with shit.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.498
By the way, I'm gonna be swearing
in front of you guys now.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.707
Fair enough.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.418
And I'm only gonna be eating
packaged meats from now on.

09:04.502 --> 09:08.047
We're gonna get our lives back to normal.
We'll just have this little family secret.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.550
Kind of like the time
when Dad got himself in the paper

09:10.633 --> 09:12.760
for putting out that fire he started.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.471
This isn't hanging a piñata
too close to the campfire.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.641
There's a cop in our backyard
who could send you to jail for murder.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.892
I'm going.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.360
Hey, Dan. What's up?

09:29.443 --> 09:33.072
Noticed you were spraying your lawn
in the night with some kind of chemical.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.615
Yeah.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.995
-We have ants.
-Ants?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.330
Yeah. You know...

09:41.414 --> 09:43.416
[snarling]

09:45.293 --> 09:46.877
They don't look like that,
but we have them.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.922
And you needed to spray for them
at 2:45 in the morning?

09:50.006 --> 09:53.301
-I was up. I figured they were, too.
-What's going on?

09:53.384 --> 09:56.804
Apparently, Dan saw us out here last night
and was wondering what we were doing.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.015
How about it's none
of your fucking business, Dan?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.350
-Maybe that's what we were doing.
-[laughs]

10:01.434 --> 10:05.563
I bet, as sheriff deputy, people
don't usually talk to you like that

10:05.646 --> 10:09.400
because it only arouses suspicion,
where there shouldn't be any.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.153
So we were spraying for ants
and that's settled.

10:12.236 --> 10:16.657
Listen, it's not great
that you walk into our yard like this.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.117
So let's not do that anymore.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.537
You wanna stay on top
of an ant problem, Joel.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.955
It could overwhelm you.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.168
Right... but remember my thing, too.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.136
Excuse me.

10:37.219 --> 10:40.097
Do you know where I might find
Dr. Hasmedi's office?

10:40.681 --> 10:44.894
-What do you need him for?
-I... just have a few questions.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.730
Fine. Don't tell me.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.609
I'm fucking with you, man.
No one tells me anything, so we're cool.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.653
End of the hall,
make a left, then a right.

10:55.029 --> 10:55.863
Thank you.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.742
Whatever... douchebag.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.959
-Come in.
-Dr. Hasmedi?

11:09.043 --> 11:12.380
-Yes?
-Hi, I'm Joel Wichita.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.590
Wichita, like the city?

11:15.174 --> 11:16.300
I guess.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.470
I just have a few questions about
something that's happening to a friend

11:19.553 --> 11:23.265
that I'm wondering if might be a virus
and where I might go for help.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.527
[sighs]

11:35.945 --> 11:37.196
Mmm.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.461
[shudders and retches]

11:56.465 --> 11:57.466
Uh-oh.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.803
So the person's blood is dry?

12:00.886 --> 12:04.640
Not like a powder, more... just thick.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.476
Kind of a tar-like substance.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.603
-Tar?
-Like substance.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.898
-And they only eat raw meat.
-That's right. And...

12:14.400 --> 12:15.693
they threw up this.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.407
Hmm.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.869
I didn't have formaldehyde,
so I saved it in olive oil.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.329
That was good thinking.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.957
Do you mind if I ask
a colleague to join us?

12:30.040 --> 12:32.418
If you think that'll help, great.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.837
[school bell ringing]

12:36.380 --> 12:39.133
Hey. Wait, why aren't you in class?

12:39.216 --> 12:42.428
After last night,
school just seems so trivial.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.639
I could not listen to Mrs. Flothman
talk about the Punic Wars.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.266
So you're just leaving?

12:47.349 --> 12:51.687
Yeah, like the Punics did from Sicily.
Huh. I was listening.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.064
-[chuckles]
-Who is this?

12:54.148 --> 12:57.067
Oh, uh, I built him for science.
He can walk and talk.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.946
King Robot Baratheon, say hi to Abby.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.161
Fucking thing.
I spent like six weeks on it.

13:07.244 --> 13:10.247
-Well, good luck.
-Wait. Where are you going?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.917
I have no idea. I've never ditched before.

13:14.627 --> 13:18.088
Hang on. I'll come with you.
I know a place we can go.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.174
Okay.

13:21.050 --> 13:21.926
Okay.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.805
-[whirring]
-[computer voice] <i>Nice to meet you.</i>

13:26.889 --> 13:28.557
You are unbelievable.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.653
-Do you think it's an organ?
-Do you think it's an organ?

13:40.736 --> 13:44.073
It might be. What do you think it means?

13:44.156 --> 13:48.160
-What do you think it means?
-I don't know. Death?

13:49.495 --> 13:52.164
-Where'd you get it?
-I told you, my friend threw it up.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.918
Mr. Wichita, I'd like you
to come with me to the fifth floor.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.504
Why? What's going on up there?

13:58.587 --> 14:01.507
Until we figure out what this is
and who it came from,

14:01.590 --> 14:03.884
I think it'd be best for you
to stay with us.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.721
-You're not a virologist, are you?
-No.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.391
-You're a psychiatrist?
-Yes.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.601
But she's excellent.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.941
[cell phone vibrating]

14:20.192 --> 14:22.194
-Hi, honey.
-[Sheila] <i>How did it go?</i>

14:22.278 --> 14:23.779
Well, they haven't heard
about any outbreaks,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.155
but they might be chasing me.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.490
-What's up?
-<i>Carl called.</i>

14:26.574 --> 14:29.535
<i>-And the buyers want to come now.</i>
-Now? What did you tell him?

14:29.618 --> 14:31.287
To shut the fuck up.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.123
Oh, God. You gotta stop
saying that to people.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.709
Well, he's always yelling.
I don't like it anymore.

14:36.792 --> 14:40.462
All right, stay put.
I'll be there in 45 minutes.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.215
-Did you eat today?
-I wasn't hungry.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.842
And I'm already at the listing.

14:44.925 --> 14:48.387
Christ. Okay, I'm on my way.
Try not to swear at anybody.

14:48.470 --> 14:52.308
-Fuck you, I'm not an idiot.
-There you go. Like that.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.692
I think you should eat something.
You know how you get.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.819
[groans]

15:04.945 --> 15:06.488
I can't eat meat anymore.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.948
What do you mean?
That's all you can eat.

15:08.032 --> 15:12.578
I've been trying all morning,
and it repulses me since I've had Gary.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.790
Well, we can't start killing people.
We're getting life back to normal.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.001
And killing people isn't normal,
sweetheart.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.921
-I know.
-Then dig in!

15:22.004 --> 15:27.092
What if, once I've tasted human flesh,
I can't go back?

15:31.597 --> 15:35.726
Okay. Maybe it's the freshness of it,
not the human-ness.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.144
Because Gary was super fresh.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.230
Maybe you can only eat an animal
if it's just been killed.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.315
Could that be it?

15:41.398 --> 15:43.359
-What if it's not?
-What if it is?

15:43.442 --> 15:45.986
-What if it's <i>not?</i>
-What if it<i> is?</i>

15:46.070 --> 15:48.656
All I know is that I'm getting hungry.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.033
You ate yesterday.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.078
Thank you, food police.
You eat every day.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.621
[doorbell rings]

15:55.704 --> 15:57.081
-That's them.
-[sighs]

15:57.164 --> 15:59.708
Let me take the lead.
I really think that'll work best.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.295
Okay, I'll try. I'm just not sure
holding back is my thing anymore.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.840
-What if it is?
-What if it's not?

16:06.924 --> 16:07.841
What if it...?

16:07.925 --> 16:09.343
[groans]

16:11.553 --> 16:13.180
-Hi!
-Welcome!

16:13.847 --> 16:15.766
-Where's Gary?
-No one knows.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.227
-Which is so Gary.
-Wild.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.104
Are you feeling okay?

16:20.187 --> 16:22.815
-Totally.
-She's great.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.942
We're gonna take
such good care of you.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.819
-Yay.
-Yay.

16:26.902 --> 16:30.990
And you remember the beautiful
master bedroom, with south-facing windows

16:31.073 --> 16:33.659
and impossible-to-stain
texture-plush carpeting.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.786
Mm, I love this room.

16:35.869 --> 16:39.331
Then you should buy it,
along with all the other rooms.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.916
[all chuckling]

16:41.000 --> 16:43.752
Leslie, Bill, what are you doing?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.546
-Excuse me?
-Excuse me?

16:45.629 --> 16:47.673
This is your fourth time here.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.050
-I mean, come on.
-Honey...

16:50.134 --> 16:52.761
We're just nervous
about such a big investment.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.264
Look, here's the deal with life.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.766
No matter how much we want to control it,

16:57.850 --> 17:00.853
we can't always know
where it's going to take us.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.397
Change is scary. Right, sweetheart?

17:04.481 --> 17:06.025
Let's look at the kitchen.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.776
Everyone is afraid of change,

17:07.860 --> 17:11.530
but when life is screaming,
"This is your new truth,"

17:11.613 --> 17:15.117
you need to accept it,
be bold, be brave,

17:15.200 --> 17:17.870
and live your new truth,
no matter what it is.

17:17.953 --> 17:18.912
[Leslie] Hmm.

17:20.664 --> 17:26.128
Okay, I would just add that sometimes
we may think life is telling us our truth,

17:26.211 --> 17:28.922
but we might not have
enough information yet.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.508
So, it's important
to explore all the options

17:31.592 --> 17:36.346
and exhaust every possibility
before doing something crazy.

17:41.268 --> 17:45.147
But, of course, you should buy this house.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.149
[chuckling]

17:48.067 --> 17:50.569
[rooster crowing]

17:50.652 --> 17:51.779
Is that a rooster?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.615
Comforting, like being on a farm.

17:54.698 --> 17:58.327
Uh, actually, loud.
Especially first thing in the morning.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.495
[crowing]

17:59.578 --> 18:01.538
Maybe you should go next door,
see what that's about.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.458
Check out that very live bird.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.542
Mmm.

18:05.626 --> 18:10.339
I'll do that because I, too, would like
to find a simple solution to this problem.

18:16.970 --> 18:21.058
The owners have had a few offers
fall through, so they're very motivated.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.352
[rooster screeching]

18:27.189 --> 18:28.732
[clucking]

18:30.317 --> 18:33.654
I'm taking you to the kitchen
and I mean it this time.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.489
[chuckles]

18:38.408 --> 18:39.868
I appreciate you ditching with me.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.830
I'm just not sure a comic book store
is gonna be my thing.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.874
That's like saying every world
you could ever imagine isn't your thing.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.294
This place is great.
You're gonna really like it here.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.173
-Hey, Bunchen.
-Thirty seconds, Eric.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.884
We can't read anything for more
than 30 seconds without buying it.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.344
-This is Abby.
-Hey.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.305
Thirty seconds.

19:01.181 --> 19:04.184
He has a master's in art history
and lives with his mom, so...

19:04.268 --> 19:05.727
he's pretty angry.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.566
<i>Night Scurrier.</i>

19:10.649 --> 19:13.485
A hideous mutant lives in sludge
at the bottom of a swamp,

19:13.569 --> 19:14.736
where he feels nothing but shame.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.656
Aww. He just needs to meet
the right girl.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.284
Yeah. It's just hard
because he's mostly seaweed.

19:20.993 --> 19:21.952
Oh.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.040
-So how are you doing?
-Why does everyone keep asking me that?

19:27.124 --> 19:28.625
I don't know why other people do,

19:28.709 --> 19:30.043
but I'm asking because you saw

19:30.127 --> 19:32.546
your mom and dad scrape
a half-eaten dead guy into a grave.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.842
Please. I once walked in
on my grandparents changing in a cabana.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.677
That was intense.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.638
Besides, Mom and Dad want our lives
to go back to normal,

19:41.722 --> 19:44.308
so I guess that's what's happening.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.809
Thirty seconds!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.730
Parents always want life to be normal.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.983
When my mom and dad got divorced,
my mom said everything would be the same,

19:53.066 --> 19:55.110
but nothing was.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.238
My dad left town and my mom married
a horrible dickwad shithead asshole

19:58.322 --> 20:00.032
who she thinks I'm too critical of.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.664
[Eric] <i>Mombie.</i>
That's not a good one.

20:07.748 --> 20:11.251
-It's okay. I'm-- I'm okay.
-That's nothing like your mom, Abby.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.087
Your mom may stay exactly like she is
forever and everything will be fine.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.672
I know. I'm just looking at it.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.467
-Thirty seconds!
-What does it matter, Bunchen?

20:18.550 --> 20:19.927
-Eric!
-It's all good.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.262
Uh, come on, Abby.
Here, check out <i>Njor Skuvelkrodd.</i>

20:22.346 --> 20:24.264
It's from the Netherlands.
Brilliant stuff.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.767
Njor gets lost in time
and becomes his own lover.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.939
Mombie eats the family dog?
Why would she do that?

20:32.022 --> 20:34.358
Because she's crazy.
It doesn't mean anything.

20:34.858 --> 20:39.238
-Hey, why don't we go to the beach, huh?
-Thirty seconds, Eric's friend.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.782
Abby. My name is Abby.

20:41.865 --> 20:44.910
Oh, Abby. Well, that changes everything.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.287
-I'll buy it.
-No, I haven't decided if I want it yet.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.456
Thirty seconds. Why is that so hard...?

20:49.539 --> 20:51.291
-[gags, gasping]
-[Eric] Oh!

20:51.375 --> 20:54.503
Maybe I just don't feel like following
all the rules today, okay, Bunchen?

20:54.586 --> 20:56.255
Okay, wow. Abb... Hey, Abby...

20:56.338 --> 20:59.508
That's fine, Abby.
You take all the time you need.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.842
Thank you.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.431
You were right. I do like it here.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.184
Good.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.190
Brand-new. It has speed chill technology.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.401
So you can place a warm pot inside

21:17.484 --> 21:21.196
without worrying about increasing
the entire internal temperature.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.617
And I've been assured that the rooster
will no longer be a problem.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.743
[puffs]

21:28.203 --> 21:29.663
-Thank you so much. Bye.
-Thanks again.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.540
We'll get your offer in right away.

21:33.667 --> 21:37.629
-We did it! We got an offer!
-We got an offer! And you ate, right?

21:37.713 --> 21:40.966
-And it's a good offer, too.
-Yeah, it's great. And you ate, right?

21:41.049 --> 21:43.051
I'm so excited!

21:43.135 --> 21:44.678
We should jump up and down.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.222
Maybe make it our new thing
whenever we get an offer.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.892
So you ate the rooster, right?
Because I also want to jump up and down.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.145
Then you should do it!

21:53.228 --> 21:55.814
Ohh! We sold a house!
And we can raise chickens,

21:55.897 --> 21:58.942
or maybe a lamb,
if we don't get emotionally attached.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.819
[chuckles]

22:02.404 --> 22:05.532
-What?
-[sighs] I couldn't eat the rooster.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.034
But...

22:07.909 --> 22:09.077
I jumped.

22:09.161 --> 22:13.081
I'm sorry. I wanted you to be happy,
even for a minute.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.667
But it was alive, like Gary.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.712
[sighs] Yeah, but Gary tasted so good.

22:19.629 --> 22:23.633
-Again, tiny balls.
-We can't kill people, Sheila.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.677
I know.

22:28.013 --> 22:33.185
What if I just ate pieces of people,
and then we let them go? No, that's worse.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.812
-Come with me.
-Where?

22:38.023 --> 22:39.316
I'm taking you to dinner.

22:47.324 --> 22:51.369
-This place is creepy.
-Yeah, well, so are we.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.421
Yeah?

23:02.130 --> 23:07.219
I'm just gonna give you $100,
and that's just for opening the door.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.932
-This is my wife.
-Hello.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.519
We need a body.

23:17.646 --> 23:18.605
You gonna fuck it?

23:24.027 --> 23:27.072
Yes, we're gonna fuck it.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.324
All night long.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.328
So... what would that cost?

23:33.412 --> 23:37.499
We'd want to take it with us,
of course, because we're shy.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.961
Well, you know, it's gonna cost extra
'cause there's two of you.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.420
That seems arbitrary.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.631
If you're renting a car,
you don't pay per person.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.299
You do if both people are fucking it.

23:46.383 --> 23:50.262
-Just tell us how much.
-Five grand. Cash.

23:50.345 --> 23:54.349
-Five grand. Jesus!
-You got an expensive hobby, lover boy.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.559
[moans]

23:57.519 --> 24:01.815
What can we get for... another $400?

24:03.733 --> 24:05.318
And a Starbucks card.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.079
Yum! [chuckling] Looks good.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.341
Ohh... [panting]

24:31.344 --> 24:33.180
[retching]

24:33.263 --> 24:34.764
[clears throat]

24:34.848 --> 24:37.851
I can't. The meat's too old or something.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.020
Come on, sweetie.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.398
It's the most expensive meal
I ever bought you.

24:43.481 --> 24:46.359
-[sniffs] It smells like chemicals.
-Please eat the foot.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.029
-I can't.
-Please, eat it.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.950
Eat the foot! Eat the foot!
Eat the goddamn foot!

24:58.997 --> 25:00.707
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

25:02.083 --> 25:05.003
It's been a stressful 24 hours.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.508
-Why is this happening to me?
-I don't know.

25:10.592 --> 25:14.471
Do you think it could be those clams
I had at Japopo's?

25:15.138 --> 25:16.139
I don't know.
