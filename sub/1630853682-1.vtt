Plural noun: tellies.

40:29.701 --> 40:32.163
Another term for television.

40:32.198 --> 40:35.573
- There has been
a cowboy film on telly.

40:35.608 --> 40:37.872
There's been a cowboy...

40:37.907 --> 40:42.173
I've got to say,
I'm enjoying this magic moment.

40:42.208 --> 40:44.912
Good. I'm glad you are.

40:44.947 --> 40:47.277
I've done you some
sponge fingers for afterwards.

40:47.312 --> 40:48.784
Yumsville.

40:48.819 --> 40:50.786
But first, a destination
that for years

40:50.821 --> 40:53.382
has been synonymous
with exotic travel.

40:53.417 --> 40:55.758
Honolulu in Hawaii.

40:55.793 --> 40:59.157
Now, there is so much to do
in Honolulu.

40:59.192 --> 41:00.598
Everything from snorkeling to...

41:00.633 --> 41:02.292
Where is that, please?

41:02.327 --> 41:04.327
...horseback riding
to helicopter tours,

41:04.362 --> 41:06.131
it really is the perfect place

41:06.166 --> 41:08.639
for sun, sea, adventure,
thrills and spills.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.201
-Where, Brian?
-- Honolulu.

41:10.236 --> 41:12.808
Put your head down
while you have your dinner.

41:12.843 --> 41:14.579
In tropical Honolulu...

41:14.614 --> 41:16.845
What is it called again, please?

41:16.880 --> 41:18.979
Honolulu.

41:19.014 --> 41:21.212
-Hunna-loy-loy.
-No.

41:21.247 --> 41:22.510
Honolulu.

41:22.545 --> 41:24.446
-Honey-lay-lay.

41:24.481 --> 41:25.821
It's Honolulu.

41:25.856 --> 41:28.087
Hono-loop-loop.

41:31.763 --> 41:33.158
What are you doing?

41:33.193 --> 41:34.665
Let's go there, Brian.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.701
It's hotter than here,
and it looks wonderful.

41:37.736 --> 41:40.803
Will you sit down, please?

41:41.674 --> 41:43.938
I want to go to Hono-la-la.

41:43.973 --> 41:46.644
Not now, you don't.
You're having your dinner.

41:46.679 --> 41:48.371
Horses and helicopters, please.

41:48.406 --> 41:50.582
You sit down
and have your dinner.

41:50.617 --> 41:52.584
-No.
-I beg your pardon?

41:52.619 --> 41:54.718
-I don't want to sit down.
-Charles.

41:54.753 --> 41:56.984
I want to go to Honol.

41:57.019 --> 41:59.481
Can we park
this Honolulu chatter, please,

41:59.516 --> 42:02.319
and sit down and eat our dinner?

42:03.927 --> 42:05.421
So come along and experience...

42:05.456 --> 42:07.159
Okay.

42:07.194 --> 42:08.600
Bossy boots.

42:08.635 --> 42:10.602
Let's see what's on
the other side.

42:10.637 --> 42:12.032
-Best wishes...

42:12.067 --> 42:13.770
HOST
...one and only Gary Barlow!

42:13.805 --> 42:16.608
-Oh, I like him.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.825
- Packet of Ringwald's
Gold, will you, please, June?

42:36.927 --> 42:38.630
8.90, please.

42:38.665 --> 42:41.028
And a cherry and almond
nougat bar.

42:42.064 --> 42:44.394
I see the bonfire's
coming along.

42:44.429 --> 42:46.671
It's a big one this year.

42:48.334 --> 42:50.235
The...?

42:50.270 --> 42:52.204
Sorry?

42:52.239 --> 42:54.206
The bonfire?

42:54.241 --> 42:55.570
My bonfire, June.

42:55.605 --> 42:57.781
- Well, I didn't mean
anything by that.

42:57.816 --> 43:00.377
I'm in charge of
the bonfires round here.

43:00.412 --> 43:02.148
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

43:02.183 --> 43:05.921
That's nine pound, uh, 60,
I think, Eddie.

43:08.024 --> 43:12.631
Or, uh, shall I just
put it on your slate?

43:14.657 --> 43:16.294
Yeah.

43:17.132 --> 43:18.835
Yeah, I reckon
you should do that.

43:25.008 --> 43:27.404
What you doing over there?

43:28.572 --> 43:31.749
Browsing around. Browsing.

43:33.984 --> 43:36.820
-Browsing, is it?
-Yeah.

43:36.855 --> 43:38.822
Is there much to browse
in here, is there?

43:38.857 --> 43:41.187
Yeah. This shelf isn't bad.

43:41.222 --> 43:44.388
Sneaking around, uh, with
his little table tennis bat.

43:44.423 --> 43:47.127
Were you playing table tennis
on your own again?

43:49.593 --> 43:50.768
No.

43:50.803 --> 43:52.297
Browsing Away Brian.

43:52.332 --> 43:53.903
Brian the Browser.

43:53.938 --> 43:55.872
That's what they call him.
Well, they used to call him

43:55.907 --> 43:57.533
other things, didn't they?

43:57.568 --> 43:59.843
There you are.

43:59.878 --> 44:01.746
-Whoops.

44:01.781 --> 44:03.781
You should probably pick
those up for June, I reckon.

44:03.816 --> 44:05.409
Yeah, I will do.

44:07.853 --> 44:09.512
- You don't
have to do that, Brian.

44:09.547 --> 44:11.217
Oh, it's all right.

44:18.721 --> 44:20.028
BRIAN
Charles.

44:20.063 --> 44:23.031
I've got a pressie for you.

44:29.567 --> 44:31.303
Charles?

44:32.240 --> 44:34.570
Charles, are you up there?
I've got a present.

44:36.574 --> 44:38.310
Charles?

44:44.450 --> 44:46.351
Charles!

44:49.323 --> 44:51.026
Charles!

44:53.294 --> 44:54.656
Charles!

44:54.691 --> 44:57.098
-- Oh, no.
-You stop now.

44:57.133 --> 44:59.496
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

44:59.531 --> 45:01.069
I am going to Hanali-alu-lu.

45:01.104 --> 45:03.137
Don't be silly,
going to Honolulu.

45:03.172 --> 45:04.941
Honestly, what are you wearing?

45:04.976 --> 45:06.844
It's my Hawaiian hula skirt.

45:06.879 --> 45:08.978
Oh, you're being daft.
You're being daft.

45:09.013 --> 45:11.673
You're soaking.
Look at my best brown shoes.

45:11.708 --> 45:13.312
I am going to Hono-loop-loop.

45:13.347 --> 45:15.149
No, no, you're not going
to Hono-loop-loop.

45:15.184 --> 45:18.152
-You're coming with me.
-Let go, man.

45:18.187 --> 45:20.319
-Don't pull me.
-I want to go to Hono-loop-loop.

45:20.354 --> 45:22.552
No, you're not going, Charles.
Come with me.

45:22.587 --> 45:24.224
You live with me in the cottage.

45:24.259 --> 45:26.721
-But I want to go.
-Honestly.

45:26.756 --> 45:28.690
Why won't you let me go, Brian?

45:28.725 --> 45:30.560
I want to dance on the beach.

45:30.595 --> 45:32.100
It's miles away.

45:32.135 --> 45:34.531
I know. That's why I want to go.

45:34.566 --> 45:36.335
You'd miss me, wouldn't you?

45:36.370 --> 45:39.239
♪ ♪

45:56.962 --> 45:59.292
What is going on up there?

46:04.299 --> 46:07.333
He said to me last night
he wanted to get a taxi to town,

46:07.368 --> 46:09.269
hang out by the shops.

46:12.307 --> 46:14.571
It's like he's changed
overnight.

46:20.381 --> 46:24.119
I can't just let him go off
on his own, can I?

46:40.236 --> 46:43.006
Cold night tonight, innit?

46:49.443 --> 46:51.509
<i>Charles?</i>

46:52.611 --> 46:54.479
Wakey-wakey.

46:55.746 --> 46:57.251
Charles?

46:59.024 --> 47:01.156
Oi. Wake up.

47:01.191 --> 47:02.718
Wake up.

47:02.753 --> 47:05.655
Huh? Come on.

47:05.690 --> 47:07.855
What do you want now?

47:07.890 --> 47:10.594
Don't talk to me like that.

47:10.629 --> 47:13.795
I just wondered if you wanted
to go into the village.

47:13.830 --> 47:15.632
Who with?

47:15.667 --> 47:17.172
With me.

47:17.207 --> 47:19.570
You said I wasn't allowed,
Brian.

47:19.605 --> 47:22.573
Yeah, well, I've changed
my mind just this once.

47:22.608 --> 47:24.377
I'll walk in and meet you there.

47:24.412 --> 47:26.841
You will not walk in
and meet me there.

47:26.876 --> 47:28.777
You'll come with me
in the truck,

47:28.812 --> 47:31.021
or you won't go at all.

47:31.056 --> 47:33.991
-Whatever.
-Don't say "whatever."

47:35.456 --> 47:37.291
What...

47:41.363 --> 47:43.429
...ever.

47:53.507 --> 47:56.475
- What you doing?
Why are you wearing that?

47:56.510 --> 47:58.147
I feel pretty cool.

47:58.182 --> 47:59.984
Not in my old curtains,
you don't.

48:00.019 --> 48:02.613
Put something else on. Hoopla!

48:03.715 --> 48:05.682
Spoilsport.

48:09.853 --> 48:11.589
How's he done that?

48:20.369 --> 48:21.973
Okay.

48:24.373 --> 48:25.867
Come on, then.

48:25.902 --> 48:27.737
Are we going to the shops,
Brian?

48:27.772 --> 48:29.211
Yes, we are going to the shops.

48:29.246 --> 48:30.872
Now, do as you're told, okay?

48:30.907 --> 48:32.940
There are some things
that I need.

48:32.975 --> 48:34.348
Things you need?

48:34.383 --> 48:36.911
I'd like a map of the world
for my wall.

48:36.946 --> 48:38.517
Right, okay.
Well, maybe not today,

48:38.552 --> 48:40.453
'cause I've got stuff to do,
but...

48:40.488 --> 48:42.224
And some soap.

48:42.259 --> 48:44.688
-Soap?
-And some cotton socks.

48:44.723 --> 48:46.129
Cotton socks?

48:46.164 --> 48:47.460
And I want to sit
in the front, Brian.

48:47.495 --> 48:49.231
No, you're not sitting
in the front.

48:49.266 --> 48:50.463
You're sitting in the back.
You're not old enough.

48:50.498 --> 48:52.432
I want to go
in the front, Brian.

48:52.467 --> 48:55.204
You're not old enough
to go in the front.

48:55.239 --> 48:57.866
I want you in the back.

48:57.901 --> 49:00.209
-Front.
-Not front.

49:00.244 --> 49:02.211
I will sit in the front, Brian.

49:02.246 --> 49:04.576
You will not sit in the front.
You'll sit in the back.

49:04.611 --> 49:06.974
Maybe I could drive
and you could walk, Brian.

49:07.009 --> 49:10.648
You have got a very,
very cheeky brain,

49:10.683 --> 49:12.782
and I don't like it.

49:12.817 --> 49:14.586
I don't know
what's got into you.

49:14.621 --> 49:18.029
It's the same blue eye
but a different attitude.

49:18.064 --> 49:20.955
A very, very cheeky robot.

49:20.990 --> 49:22.396
Cheeky?

49:22.431 --> 49:23.793
Cheeky, yes.

49:23.828 --> 49:26.598
-Cheeky bot.
-Cheeky bot?

49:27.832 --> 49:29.502
Cheeky bot sit
in the front, Brian.

49:29.537 --> 49:31.240
Stop saying "front."

49:31.275 --> 49:33.473
Front, front, front,
front, front,

49:33.508 --> 49:36.080
front, front,
front, front, front.

49:39.910 --> 49:42.152
-Are we there yet?
-No.

49:42.187 --> 49:44.682
If you're good,
I'll take you to the lake.

49:44.717 --> 49:46.321
-- Lake?
-Yes.

49:46.356 --> 49:48.191
I need to quickly stop
at the shop, okay?

49:48.226 --> 49:50.490
-I'll come as well
and say hello. -No, you won't.

49:50.525 --> 49:53.922
You've got to stay in the truck
and keep your head down.

49:53.957 --> 49:56.826
Can we go to
the swimming pool, Brian?

49:56.861 --> 49:59.433
- Swimming pool?
There is no swimming pool.

49:59.468 --> 50:01.237
Can we go to the airport?

50:01.272 --> 50:03.140
There is no airport.

50:03.175 --> 50:04.933
Can we go to the zoo, Brian?

50:04.968 --> 50:06.473
There is no zoo.

50:06.508 --> 50:09.509
There's a kennels.
That's just dogs.

50:10.314 --> 50:12.809
-- Dogs?
-Yes, dogs.

50:13.779 --> 50:15.350
Right.

50:15.385 --> 50:17.220
I won't be long, okay?

50:17.255 --> 50:20.091
Don't do anything. Right?

50:53.951 --> 50:55.555
Hello.

50:58.021 --> 50:59.988
I am Charles Petrescu.

51:00.023 --> 51:02.100
Who are you, please?

51:02.894 --> 51:04.663
H-Hazel.

51:04.698 --> 51:07.666
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Hazel.

51:08.933 --> 51:10.834
What, uh...

51:10.869 --> 51:12.209
What are you?

51:12.244 --> 51:14.904
I am Charles Petrescu.

51:15.775 --> 51:18.413
Do you live in the fields
with the sheep?

51:18.448 --> 51:21.713
No, I live in the village
with my mum and a parrot.

51:21.748 --> 51:26.421
- an exotic jungle bird
known for its flamboyant colors.

51:26.456 --> 51:29.655
Characteristic features include
a strong, curved bill.

51:29.690 --> 51:31.591
- Yes, he's green,
and he's got red shoul...

51:31.626 --> 51:35.199
- Did you know
the most important components

51:35.234 --> 51:37.762
of most parrots' diets
are seeds?

51:39.370 --> 51:41.139
Please don't tell anyone.

51:42.274 --> 51:45.539
-Please.
-I-I won't. I won't.

51:45.574 --> 51:47.101
What is he?

51:47.136 --> 51:48.476
A robot.

51:48.511 --> 51:50.247
I am Charles Petrescu.

51:50.282 --> 51:52.106
Did you build him, Brian?

51:52.141 --> 51:53.844
Yeah.

51:53.879 --> 51:56.451
- We're going
to the lake for a walk.

51:56.486 --> 51:57.881
Oh, I-I'm... I'm sorry.

51:57.916 --> 51:59.454
-I didn't mean to...
-- No, no, no, no.

51:59.489 --> 52:01.148
I'm sorry.
No, we're-we're just going...

52:01.183 --> 52:02.688
we were just going for
a mooch about. Charles.

52:02.723 --> 52:04.525
Is Hazel coming?

52:07.156 --> 52:08.595
No.

52:08.630 --> 52:11.092
- You should ask her
to come to the lake.

52:11.127 --> 52:12.698
Very busy.

52:13.569 --> 52:16.163
- She doesn't look
like she is busy.

52:16.198 --> 52:18.605
She'll want to come to the lake.

52:18.640 --> 52:20.244
Uh...

52:23.139 --> 52:24.809
Do you want to?

52:24.844 --> 52:26.250
Do you want to come?

52:26.285 --> 52:29.550
Well, is that all right?

52:34.326 --> 52:36.392
- How did you know
how to build him?

52:36.427 --> 52:39.153
I wouldn't know where to start.

52:39.188 --> 52:41.529
Don't know.
Just start at the beginning

52:41.564 --> 52:43.696
and use your imagination,
I suppose.

52:45.194 --> 52:47.370
- Would you like a game
of "kick the stone," Brian?

52:47.405 --> 52:49.867
- No, no, no,
I'm talking to Hazel now, okay?

52:49.902 --> 52:51.803
All right?

I want to swim across the lake

53:21.472 --> 53:23.032
and check out the other side.

53:23.067 --> 53:25.166
- Don't be ridiculous,
swim across the lake.
