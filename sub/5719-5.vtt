Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.269 --> 00:06.139
- Grandpa!
- I need your help, he's not doing well!

00:06.173 --> 00:08.708
Tim, I just want it done so
that we can move in.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.778
But you kids picked a project
that requires a gut reno,

00:11.812 --> 00:14.981
and obviously you don't have
enough time to devote to it, so.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.583
This will always be a part
of her life.

00:17.618 --> 00:21.054
This is her life. So I'll be the one
who comes to see her and Katie.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.394
I can't do it, Ty. I
need you to do it your way.

00:28.429 --> 00:32.398
That's a boy. That's a good boy.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

01:19.046 --> 01:22.248
You're a good boy. Whoa,
Spartan.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.117
Oh, so you finally decided to
catch up, did ya?

01:24.151 --> 01:26.085
I wasn't that far behind.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.920
Good boy.

01:47.975 --> 01:50.161
What're you doing standing
there?

01:50.181 --> 01:52.275
C'mon, we got work to do.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.394
- Hi, girls.
- Hey!

02:04.414 --> 02:06.440
Hi.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.960
- What are you doing?
- We're just picking up equipment

02:07.995 --> 02:09.461
to take to the Cowboy
Competition.

02:09.496 --> 02:11.664
But I thought that wasn't
for a couple of weeks.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.232
Yeah, it turns out there was
another event that same weekend,

02:13.267 --> 02:15.234
so I had to move mine up.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.203
It's been, uh, quite the mad
scramble,

02:17.237 --> 02:20.540
but luckily, Lisa offered to
help out.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.508
Called in a few favours. I think
things are coming along well.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.343
We still have a few spaces open.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.711
I don't know if you thought
any more about competing, Amy,

02:25.746 --> 02:27.476
but we would love to have you.

02:27.496 --> 02:29.296
Yeah, you know what? That'd
be fun.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.377
How about you, Georgie?

02:30.397 --> 02:32.685
Well, what is the
Cowboy Competition anyway?

02:32.719 --> 02:35.108
It's a race that challenges
the speed and ability

02:35.128 --> 02:36.789
of a working ranch horse.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.659
But not just a race. I mean,
there's-there's skill tests along the way.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.994
There's roping and branding.
It's real cowboy stuff.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.096
I mean, it's not trick
riding but...

02:44.131 --> 02:45.431
think you might wanna give it
a go?

02:45.465 --> 02:46.933
Yeah, count me in.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.846
- Good! I like it!
- Good.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.674
Ugh! Ugh.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.723
Tim, what're you doing?

02:56.743 --> 02:59.512
Oh, I'm sorry, are you still
sleeping?

02:59.546 --> 03:01.780
Yes, I was sleeping.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.249
Amy and I were working late last night

03:03.283 --> 03:05.317
and, uh, we crashed here.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.585
Well, you're the one that's
always on me

03:06.620 --> 03:08.387
about finishing this place.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.222
I can't work to your schedule.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.491
Can you do me a favour? Can
you...

03:12.526 --> 03:13.893
Can you work on something quieter?

03:13.927 --> 03:15.828
I just... I could use some
more sleep.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.364
- Fine.
- Thank you.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.194
Thank you.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.672
What about you? You got this
under control?

03:26.706 --> 03:28.674
- Just...
- I'm just...

03:28.708 --> 03:31.443
I'm just saying that
grout looks a little thin.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.878
Oh, gosh, don't you worry
about me.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.914
This grout is fine.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.854
Okay, fine. You're getting
grey dust everywhere.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.824
Ugh! Ugh!

03:53.667 --> 03:55.734
The race is gonna be awesome.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.703
They've got roping, pole bending
all kinds of cool stuff.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.371
Yeah. Lisa had to come in
last minute

03:59.406 --> 04:00.906
but it's really coming together.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.942
Well, it sounds great, guys.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.811
Hey, Grandpa, how's the, uh,
bathroom tiling coming along?

04:05.845 --> 04:08.614
Oh, fine. it's your father
that's impossible.

04:08.648 --> 04:11.650
I'd rather be dragged behind a
truck down a gravel road

04:11.685 --> 04:15.154
than listen to Tim tell me how
to use a trowel.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.656
Amy, I'm sorry, but at this rate

04:17.690 --> 04:19.379
that loft is never gonna get finished.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.120
It's getting there.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.296
What's all this?

04:24.331 --> 04:26.165
Oh! You know, I printed
these out for you.

04:26.199 --> 04:29.134
Uh, there are some great ranch
horses for sale in the area.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.469
Some of them are even a pretty
good deal.

04:30.503 --> 04:31.971
Well, I appreciate the gesture.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.906
I'm not looking for a horse.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.308
Okay. Well, how about some
breakfast then?

04:36.343 --> 04:40.479
I can make, uh, eggs,
pancakes, bacon...

04:40.513 --> 04:42.948
Ooh! How about these moose
sausages you like?

04:42.983 --> 04:47.152
- There's one thing you can do.
- Anything.

04:47.187 --> 04:50.456
You can stop treating me
like I'm made out of glass.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.697
- What about breakfast?
- Not hungry.

05:05.279 --> 05:07.072
I have an idea.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.635
Buddy?
He's the perfect horse for Jack

05:13.655 --> 05:14.880
and I'm gonna prove it.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.283
I'm gonna enter the Cowboy
Competition on this guy.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.318
I don't know, Georgie. It's
too soon.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.553
And roping and branding take
a lot of practice.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.022
It's not something you can
just take up,

05:23.056 --> 05:24.494
especially on a new horse.

05:24.514 --> 05:27.526
I know, but I'm worried about
Jack and I know you are, too.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.163
Of course we are,
sweetheart, but...

05:29.183 --> 05:31.997
He hasn't ridden a horse
since he retired Paint,

05:32.032 --> 05:35.267
and now that Paint's gone,
what if he never rides again?

05:35.302 --> 05:37.722
Wouldn't it be great if he could
connect with another horse?

05:37.742 --> 05:38.871
With this horse?

05:38.905 --> 05:41.429
Yes, but you saw what just
happened in the kitchen.

05:41.449 --> 05:43.575
- He said he's not ready.
- Yeah.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.779
Georgie, Grandpa needs time to grieve.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.481
Jack misses riding. I know
he does!

05:49.516 --> 05:51.984
If he could just watch Buddy
and I compete in the race,

05:52.018 --> 05:55.387
he'll see what a great ranch
horse he can be.

05:57.682 --> 05:59.091
- Okay.
- Okay?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.160
You can enter him in the
Cowboy Competition,

06:01.194 --> 06:04.163
but don't expect Grandpa to
just change his mind suddenly.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.898
Yeah, and you'll be doing
all the training yourself

06:05.932 --> 06:08.701
because I'm up to my ears in
client horses.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.903
Plus, Casey's been texting me
to come help set up the course.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.971
And don't forget about your
chores and studying.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.503
Okay, I won't. I promise.

06:18.822 --> 06:21.613
Huh? We're gonna make Jack
love you.

If we make the riders go

07:08.094 --> 07:10.295
So there's two of everything?

07:10.330 --> 07:12.831
Yeah, 'cause, uh, two riders go out
at the same time, head-to-head,

07:12.866 --> 07:15.033
and then the fastest horse
through the course wins.

07:15.468 --> 07:16.802
So what's all this for?

07:16.836 --> 07:18.203
That's the Concession.

07:18.237 --> 07:19.938
I have an incredible caterer coming

07:19.972 --> 07:21.840
with the some delicious snack options...

07:21.874 --> 07:24.509
eggplant fritters, duck confit tacos...

07:24.544 --> 07:26.711
Wait. Duck confit? 'Cause I...

07:26.746 --> 07:28.313
Kinda just thought we'd have a
barbecue, you know?

07:28.347 --> 07:31.883
Hot dogs and hamburgers and...
some beer and soft drinks.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.519
Well, that was before I invited
all my English riding friends,

07:34.554 --> 07:37.823
and we have to get them excited
about this rodeo stuff somehow.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.659
Okay, um...

07:40.693 --> 07:42.227
Anyway, Amy, I could really
use some help

07:42.261 --> 07:43.895
getting the rest of the poles
out of that truck.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.363
- Would you mind?
- Yup, sure. No, I'll be right there.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.766
- Thanks.
- Oh, shoot! I have a date with a caterer.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.868
- I'll see you girls later.
- Oh, can I get a ride out to Heartland?

07:49.902 --> 07:51.403
- I have some training to do.
- Yeah, come with me.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.672
You're gonna be okay with
Buddy on your own?

07:53.706 --> 07:55.440
Yeah, totally. He's a roping
horse, right?

07:55.474 --> 07:57.075
He was, a long time ago.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.610
He's been through a lot since then.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.045
Just be patient with him.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.781
Okay, sure.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.316
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:04.350 --> 08:06.518
Take it easy there, old fella.
You might hurt yourself.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.820
Fine then. Use your bad shoulder.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.856
You know

08:10.890 --> 08:12.824
Ugh.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.260
- What?
- The General.

08:15.294 --> 08:18.129
So?

08:18.164 --> 08:20.165
Always drifting in and out
of here like he owns the place.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.795
You can't have your cake and
eat it, too.

08:21.815 --> 08:22.904
What does that even mean?

08:22.924 --> 08:26.807
Means what ever the General wants,
the General gets.

08:27.812 --> 08:30.609
I'm tired of everybody bending over
backwards for him all the time.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.778
You know what? Your jabs and
snarky comments,

08:33.813 --> 08:36.313
they're getting real old.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.683
Maybe it's time the two of you
just had an honest conversation.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.253
Just clear the air.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.020
Oh, thanks, Jack.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.090
I think that's the first time ever

08:45.124 --> 08:47.392
that you've given me advice
that I could actually use.

08:47.426 --> 08:50.662
That just means it's the
first time you ever listened.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.200
Who's this?

08:55.799 --> 08:58.336
- Daddy!
- Hey!

08:58.371 --> 09:00.805
Muah!

09:00.840 --> 09:03.308
We weren't expecting you
'til next week.

09:03.342 --> 09:04.743
Oh, you better check your
calendar then

09:04.777 --> 09:06.177
'cause next week is this week.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.980
I am sorry. I completely got
the dates mixed up.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.116
It's okay, it happens.
Georgie around?

09:11.150 --> 09:13.551
She's not home and we are
late for ballet.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.854
- We gotta go, we gotta go.
- Oh, uh, well, I can take her.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.522
No, no, no. I have to run
into Maggie's, anyway.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.090
We won't be long, 'kay? Come
on, come on, come on.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.517
Okay.

09:20.877 --> 09:24.262
- See you when you get back.
- You got the seat belt? Yup, bye.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.630
Good?

09:42.348 --> 09:44.215
Dad! I didn't know you were coming.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.650
Yeah, apparently no one did.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.422
Well, it feels like days
since I've seen you.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.057
Well, I know, and I'm only
dropping Georgie off

09:52.091 --> 09:53.391
and then going to meet the caterer.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.093
Well, but you've got time
for a coffee.

09:55.127 --> 09:58.163
- Well, I really don't, Jack.
- Yes, c-come on.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.431
All right.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.536
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?

10:04.570 --> 10:07.372
- Nice to see you!
- You, too.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.309
I only have a few
days to become an expert roper

10:11.344 --> 10:13.278
for the Cowboy Competition.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.914
So this is Buddy, huh? The
one who was sick?

10:15.948 --> 10:18.984
Uh, yeah. He's all better
now and hopefully,

10:19.018 --> 10:21.920
if everything goes to plan,
he'll be Jack's new horse.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.888
Yeah, I was sorry to hear
about Paint.

10:23.923 --> 10:26.658
Jack hasn't ridden since his horse died.

10:26.692 --> 10:29.239
And he's sad. I know he is

10:29.259 --> 10:31.195
even though he won't admit it.

10:31.630 --> 10:34.566
Okay. Well, um...

10:34.600 --> 10:36.701
I'm here to help, if you need me.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.874
I don't know much about Cowboy
Competitions, but...

10:38.894 --> 10:40.305
That's okay.

10:40.339 --> 10:43.141
Buddy's a roper and Jack's
given me a few lessons,

10:43.175 --> 10:45.710
so, hopefully, by the time I
figure this rope out,

10:45.745 --> 10:48.246
Buddy will do the rest for me.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.583
Sounds good.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.659
Ugh, darn!

11:15.441 --> 11:16.875
Oh! Ungh!

11:16.909 --> 11:19.177
- Georgie!
- Ugh.

11:19.211 --> 11:22.180
- Hey, hey. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

11:22.214 --> 11:25.950
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:25.985 --> 11:29.421
Ah, geez. Okay, let's... why
don't we take a break, huh?

11:29.455 --> 11:31.022
- No. No, I-I...
- You come down to the Dude Ranch with me.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.358
- I can keep going.
- No, no, no. Well, just let's,

11:33.392 --> 11:35.827
let's wait till Amy shows up
then, all right?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.440
Don't worry. I'll-I'll get the expert.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.801
Things between us
aren't exactly great.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.439
I mean, I know I asked Lisa
for her help,

11:47.473 --> 11:50.041
but I didn't think she'd
completely take over.

11:50.076 --> 11:52.677
I mean, she wants to turn it
into this big thing, you know?

11:52.711 --> 11:55.380
At this point, I would be happy if
people just came out and I broke even.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.682
Lisa lives for this kind of thing.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.818
But I promise you, if you give
her a chance,

11:59.852 --> 12:02.053
she will make your event
something special.

12:02.088 --> 12:05.290
Just stick up for what you
want. You'll be okay.

12:07.148 --> 12:08.997
I'll try. Thanks.

12:09.767 --> 12:13.832
So how's the event coming along?

12:13.866 --> 12:18.169
Well, Casey and I aren't
exactly on the same page.

12:19.016 --> 12:20.638
Uh-oh.

12:20.673 --> 12:24.042
Well, she asked for my help and
she's vetoed every idea I've had.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.945
I mean, I don't know what her
rodeo friends are like,

12:26.979 --> 12:29.247
but I need more than imported
beer to impress mine.

12:29.281 --> 12:32.784
Hey, you think Casey's stubborn?
You oughta try dealing with Tim.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.554
Uh-Oh.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.168
How are race preparations coming?

12:39.188 --> 12:40.706
Oh...

12:40.726 --> 12:44.562
Fine. Just a little setback.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.665
Well, you look like you spend more
time on the ground than on the horse.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.100
Well, I could really use your help

12:49.135 --> 12:51.402
getting Buddy ready for the race.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.371
I can't.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.040
As much as I don't want to, I
need to help Tim in the loft.

12:56.075 --> 12:57.742
Please, Jack? Amy's too busy

12:57.776 --> 12:59.878
and I could really use your expertise.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.167
Since when do you need help
doing anything?

13:02.187 --> 13:03.314
Oh, come on.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.350
The race got bumped up and
she's had less time to train,

13:05.384 --> 13:09.000
and... what better way to
avoid Tim all afternoon?

13:10.737 --> 13:12.090
All right.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.427
- You're so dusty.
- I know.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.812
Hey, man.

13:25.991 --> 13:29.541
Uh, look, I'm just here to pick up some
endotracheal tubes Scott left for me.

13:29.561 --> 13:32.143
Just check on the counter.

13:34.810 --> 13:36.581
- Got it.
- Good.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.716
And next time, I think you
should find another vet.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.351
Scott and I are partners now

13:40.386 --> 13:42.720
and I don't wanna be your
supplier anymore.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.816
In fact, I'd be happy if I didn't
have to see you ever again.

13:44.836 --> 13:46.040
- Yeah.
- Good.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.417
Gotcha.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.662
What happened to this guy?

13:52.682 --> 13:54.933
Baby coyote.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.835
Scott found him on the side of
the road limping.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.471
We repaired his cruciate ligaments.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.374
You're not gonna keep him in this
cage until you release him, are you?

14:03.409 --> 14:05.744
Don't worry about it. I'm looking
for a place for him to convalesce.

14:05.764 --> 14:08.134
Well, I could take him at
the reserve.

14:08.618 --> 14:10.481
I don't think so.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.851
Look, I know you're still pissed
about that whole poaching thing.

14:13.886 --> 14:16.921
- I mean, I get it.
- "Whole poaching thing?"

14:16.956 --> 14:19.357
You mean how you profited off
the slaughter of animals?

14:19.391 --> 14:21.693
I don't plan on getting over
that any time soon.

14:21.727 --> 14:22.961
Maybe you didn't hear, but I
turned those guys in.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.964
- I did the right thing.
- Oh, you did?

14:25.998 --> 14:28.900
And how many bears were killed
before you grew a conscience?

14:28.934 --> 14:32.870
Whatever, man. I'm
just trying to help.

14:46.779 --> 14:49.088
Can I try it on the horse yet?

14:49.274 --> 14:52.223
Well, you haven't roped it
from there yet, so...

14:52.258 --> 14:54.815
just get the tip of your loop,
point it at the horns,

14:54.835 --> 14:55.945
and try again.

14:58.297 --> 15:01.524
- Yeah.
- Hey! There you go, sweetheart.

15:01.809 --> 15:02.934
Huh?

15:03.133 --> 15:04.969
So, you're doing this now?

15:05.604 --> 15:08.505
Okay, decided to throw in the towel?

15:08.540 --> 15:11.075
I'm working with Georgie.

15:11.109 --> 15:13.310
Then I'll be back to helping you.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.912
Yeah, it's a two-man job,
but, yeah,

15:14.946 --> 15:18.249
I'll find something to do.

15:18.283 --> 15:19.550
Well, I got some time
on my hands.

15:19.584 --> 15:22.122
Do you want me to... give you
a hand?

15:23.188 --> 15:24.722
Yeah, fine.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.461
Good luck.

15:39.225 --> 15:42.239
Now thread that part into
the basic strainer.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.408
- Yeah.
- Don't forget the gasket.

15:44.442 --> 15:47.150
- It's in there.
- You're sure?

15:47.461 --> 15:51.134
Yeah.
Don't rush. You're rushing, you know?

15:52.150 --> 15:54.318
- You got the washers?
- Yes.

15:54.352 --> 15:56.320
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

15:56.354 --> 15:59.761
In fact, I-I got this covered.
Absolutely.

15:59.781 --> 16:02.026
Probably go a lot quicker if
we divide and conquer.

16:02.060 --> 16:05.842
Divide and conquer. Military term.

16:07.182 --> 16:09.366
You always get what
you want, don't you, General?

16:09.401 --> 16:12.736
Oh... That never
gets old.

16:12.771 --> 16:14.305
Can you just trust my judgment
on this?

16:14.339 --> 16:16.740
- Like... I got it.
- Your judgment.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.243
Says the man who let his
family slip through his fingers.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.285
Oh, thanks.

16:31.957 --> 16:34.258
I should take this.

16:34.292 --> 16:36.961
- Hey, Ty.
- Hey!

16:36.995 --> 16:39.129
You'll never guess who just
showed up at the clinic.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.298
Bob Granger.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.334
And what did he want?

16:43.368 --> 16:46.303
He was picking up some stuff
from Scott.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.906
Ugh. I can't believe Scott would have
anything to do with that lowlife.

16:48.940 --> 16:51.108
And he had the nerve to
offer up his reserve

16:51.142 --> 16:53.811
for that injured coyote pup I
was telling you about.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.646
There's lots of other places
that pup can go to recover.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.681
That's what I told him.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.483
Well, I'm almost done here
with Casey.

16:59.517 --> 17:01.051
If you want, I can help you
make some calls.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.519
That'd be great. Thanks, Amy.

17:02.554 --> 17:03.988
I'll see you back at the
office, okay?

17:04.021 --> 17:06.790
Okay, bye.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.367
Are you just gonna stand
there glaring at me

17:17.402 --> 17:21.038
or is there something you
wanna say?

17:23.675 --> 17:25.263
Yeah, actually, I got a few
things I'd like to say.

17:25.284 --> 17:26.156
Of course there is.

17:26.176 --> 17:27.944
First of all,
it's clear you haven't done much plumbing

17:27.979 --> 17:29.847
because you would know to
tighten those nuts

17:29.881 --> 17:31.915
before you ever turn on that water.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.184
Okay. That's an easy fix.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.452
I'd check the tail piece
again, too,

17:35.487 --> 17:38.622
'cause I know it's not straight.

17:38.656 --> 17:42.693
Gotcha. Anything else?

17:42.727 --> 17:44.962
- Being honest here?
- Of course.

17:44.996 --> 17:47.564
- I'm tired.
- Okay.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.366
Tired of throwing a parade for you

17:49.401 --> 17:52.036
every time you decide to grace
us with your presence.

17:52.070 --> 17:55.672
And I'm tired of my daughter
scheduling her life around you

17:55.707 --> 17:57.775
when you're the one who walked out.

18:01.312 --> 18:03.714
Mostly, I'm just tired of
being nice to you.

18:03.748 --> 18:06.683
Being nice to me?

18:06.718 --> 18:10.020
You've never ever been nice to me, Tim.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.022
And if we're being completely
honest here you never liked me,

18:12.057 --> 18:13.891
from the moment I set foot on
this property.

18:13.925 --> 18:16.260
Probably before that.

18:16.294 --> 18:17.828
Okay, you don't like me? You
know what? Newsflash.

18:17.862 --> 18:20.597
I don't like you either, Tim.

18:20.632 --> 18:23.550
- Signal received, General.
- That right there what is that?

18:23.570 --> 18:26.466
Calling me General all the time like
I'm some kind of dictator. I hate it.

18:26.486 --> 18:29.807
I call you General because you expect
everyone to bow to your every whim.

18:29.841 --> 18:31.608
Oh, that's funny, that's
really funny,

18:31.643 --> 18:34.898
'cause the only dictator I see
around here is you.

18:36.462 --> 18:37.948
I'm going for a walk.

18:37.982 --> 18:40.384
Yeah. Walk away.

18:40.418 --> 18:41.752
That's what you do best, isn't it?

18:41.786 --> 18:43.387
Yeah, it is. Here I go. Watch.

18:52.807 --> 18:54.718
Move out that swing, Georgie.

18:56.389 --> 18:58.456
And... now!

19:00.159 --> 19:02.827
Whoa! Whoa, Buddy, whoa!

19:02.862 --> 19:05.363
Dump your rope, dump your rope!

19:08.901 --> 19:10.368
I don't know what I'm doing
wrong?

19:10.403 --> 19:12.070
It's not you it's that horse.

19:12.105 --> 19:13.905
I don't think he's up for it.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.707
No, you're wrong, Buddy's a natural.

19:15.742 --> 19:17.409
Did you know he's a roping horse?

19:17.443 --> 19:21.064
Yes, Georgie, I do know
that. You told me.

19:21.084 --> 19:22.962
Why don't you get on him,
show me how it's done.

19:22.982 --> 19:26.304
Well, the only way you're gonna improve
is to keep at it. You're getting close.

19:26.324 --> 19:29.121
Yeah, but I don't want him
to develop any bad habits.

19:29.155 --> 19:31.012
Why don't you just... try him?

19:31.032 --> 19:33.058
No, no.

19:33.253 --> 19:34.792
You stick with it.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.196
I gotta get back to helping
Tim anyway.

19:48.074 --> 19:50.408
- We're home.
- Daddy!

19:50.443 --> 19:53.812
Oh! Kitty Kat! Unngghh! How
was your lesson?

19:53.846 --> 19:55.614
- Great!
- Yeah?

19:55.648 --> 19:57.386
Anything exciting happen
here while we were gone?

19:57.406 --> 19:59.618
Somehow your dad managed to
turn a nice gesture

19:59.652 --> 20:00.986
me helping with the loft

20:01.020 --> 20:03.021
into a laundry list of complaints.

20:03.056 --> 20:04.756
Turns out he's not my biggest fan.

20:04.791 --> 20:07.326
Big surprise there, right?

20:07.360 --> 20:09.078
Katie, why don't you go play
in your room, okay?

20:09.098 --> 20:11.833
- Okay.
- All right.

20:11.853 --> 20:14.633
Hey, I hope you know that none
of this is coming from me.

20:16.202 --> 20:19.137
I know, I know. You know, I
just...

20:19.172 --> 20:21.573
Hey, how's training going?

20:21.608 --> 20:23.842
It's not. Our plan's not working.

20:23.877 --> 20:26.445
Jack refuses to have anything
to do with Buddy.

20:26.479 --> 20:28.981
I never should have entered
that stupid race.

20:29.015 --> 20:30.716
Well, you can't expect Jack
just to get on a new horse

20:30.750 --> 20:33.316
and forget about all about
losing Paint, right?

20:33.336 --> 20:34.272
Life doesn't work like that.

20:34.292 --> 20:36.321
You know,
maybe Buddy's not the horse for him.

20:36.356 --> 20:38.924
Maybe he's gonna find another
horse... eventually.

20:38.958 --> 20:41.660
But Buddy is the right horse for him.

20:41.694 --> 20:44.096
I thought maybe once Jack saw
him in action,

20:44.130 --> 20:46.031
he'd wanna keep him, but...

20:46.065 --> 20:47.299
Buddy's not the roping horse
he used to be.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.901
Amy's too busy to train him,

20:48.935 --> 20:52.170
and now Jack doesn't want
anything to do with him.

20:52.205 --> 20:55.189
Everything is a huge mess right now.

20:55.842 --> 20:59.044
Look, you can't expect these
things to happen overnight.

20:59.078 --> 21:01.713
Keep at it, kiddo, okay?

21:01.748 --> 21:04.917
I know. I'm going to.

21:04.951 --> 21:07.352
And you keep at it, too.

21:07.387 --> 21:09.621
You know, don't let him get to you.

21:09.656 --> 21:12.057
He's just testing you. He's
trying to push your buttons.

21:12.091 --> 21:13.425
I don't know what you want
me to do, Lou.

21:13.459 --> 21:15.694
Just smile and nod while he
insults me to my face?

21:15.728 --> 21:17.496
I don't have all the answers,

21:17.530 --> 21:20.152
but you two need to get along
for two reasons.

21:20.276 --> 21:22.336
Georgie and Katie.

21:27.273 --> 21:29.841
- So you don't have any room at all?
- Okay.

21:29.876 --> 21:32.210
- No, I understand, it's just...
- Yup.

21:32.245 --> 21:33.745
- Well, how 'bout you give me a call...
- Will do. Okay.

21:33.780 --> 21:35.347
- if anything changes?
- Thanks.

21:35.381 --> 21:38.784
Thank you. Any luck?

21:38.818 --> 21:40.852
It is surprisingly difficult to
find a place that'll take coyotes.

21:40.887 --> 21:42.354
Yeah, well, let's keep trying.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.223
How 'bout you take Lethbridge,
I'll take Strathmore?

21:45.258 --> 21:46.725
Okay.

21:48.795 --> 21:50.829
Hi, this is Dr. Ty Borden.

21:50.863 --> 21:54.032
I'm wondering if you have room
for an injured coyote pup?

21:54.067 --> 21:56.034
Not one place was willing to
work with us.

21:56.069 --> 21:57.669
I don't know what Ty's gonna do.

21:57.704 --> 21:59.304
That's terrible.

22:02.008 --> 22:03.609
Is everything okay with you?

22:03.643 --> 22:06.878
Yes, I'm sorry. I... I'm
just worried about Georgie.

22:06.913 --> 22:09.114
She's still trying to get Grandpa
to fall in love with Buddy

22:09.148 --> 22:11.683
and it's not working.

22:11.718 --> 22:13.652
Sounds like she's putting a
lot of pressure on herself.

22:13.686 --> 22:16.622
She is and the worst part is
Buddy's not cooperating at all.

22:16.656 --> 22:20.225
He's not helping the situation.

22:20.259 --> 22:22.160
I was kinda hoping maybe you
could do me a favour...

22:22.195 --> 22:24.763
and help Georgie a little bit?

22:24.797 --> 22:28.166
Yes. I will carve
out some time tomorrow.

22:28.201 --> 22:30.736
Thank you. You're the best.

22:30.770 --> 22:33.839
- What would you do without me?
- Oh...

22:33.873 --> 22:35.807
Hey! Not cool.

22:35.842 --> 22:38.977
Oh! You're so immature!

22:39.012 --> 22:41.146
I'm immature?!

22:46.219 --> 22:47.619
C'mon,
Buddy, go!

22:52.492 --> 22:55.260
You need some help?

22:55.294 --> 22:56.895
He's still not getting it,
and now he won't even move.

22:56.929 --> 22:59.431
This sucks.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.466
I think I know what the problem is.

23:01.501 --> 23:03.468
I think Buddy's afraid of the steer.

23:03.503 --> 23:06.872
- But Buddy's a roping horse.
- Yes, he was.

23:06.906 --> 23:09.508
But he might not have ever
seen anything like this before.

23:09.542 --> 23:11.476
He might be a pro when it
comes to real cattle,

23:11.511 --> 23:13.211
but he doesn't know what to
make of a fake one.

23:13.246 --> 23:15.147
Great! Like Jack's gonna
want a wuss of a horse.

23:15.181 --> 23:18.917
Georgie,

23:18.951 --> 23:22.320
it's not your responsibility
to find Grandpa a new horse.

23:22.355 --> 23:23.755
You know, if he's not ready to
replace Paint,

23:23.790 --> 23:26.224
then we can't push it.

23:26.259 --> 23:29.027
Just concentrate on making
Buddy the best horse he can be,

23:29.062 --> 23:30.962
and then when Grandpa is ready,

23:30.997 --> 23:34.366
then Buddy'll be up for the
challenge.

23:34.400 --> 23:38.070
Okay, well, let's get him used
to this steer, all right?

23:38.104 --> 23:40.505
Walk him around it, let him
explore it.

23:40.540 --> 23:43.375
Just show him that it's not
that scary.

23:43.409 --> 23:45.043
You keep going. I'm just gonna
check

23:45.078 --> 23:48.747
and make sure Ty's ready for
work.

23:51.150 --> 23:52.651
Good boy.

23:56.789 --> 23:59.958
Hey, Tim, am I good to uh...

23:59.992 --> 24:01.293
- What, that?
- Use this? Yeah.

24:01.327 --> 24:02.728
- Yeah, it's good to go.
- Okay.

24:02.762 --> 24:04.196
Okay.

24:10.302 --> 24:12.346
Uh, Tim?

24:13.761 --> 24:15.140
What...?

24:17.777 --> 24:20.112
- Okay.
- Ugh.

24:20.146 --> 24:24.082
You got it? Okay, okay.

24:24.117 --> 24:26.151
- You got it?
- I got it, I got it.

24:26.185 --> 24:29.454
What is going on up here?

24:29.489 --> 24:31.456
I assure you, honey,
everything is fine.

24:31.491 --> 24:33.358
There's nothing to worry about.

24:33.392 --> 24:35.794
Why does it look like
Niagara Falls in our kitchen?

24:35.828 --> 24:38.263
And where is-where is Grandpa?
I thought he was helping you.

24:38.297 --> 24:40.198
Peter was helping and
clearly he's...

24:40.233 --> 24:42.334
not much for plumbing.

25:00.652 --> 25:01.859
Good boy!

25:02.902 --> 25:04.189
Hey, Georgie!

25:04.900 --> 25:06.791
That was amazing! Nice work!

25:09.796 --> 25:13.598
I just wish that Dad and Peter
could go easy on each other.

25:13.633 --> 25:16.220
You know, maybe you could talk
to them about it.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.203
Oh, no.

25:18.237 --> 25:20.105
No, the relationship between a father

25:20.139 --> 25:22.808
and a son-in-law is
complicated enough.

25:22.842 --> 25:26.878
The relationship between a
father and an ex-son-in-law,

25:26.913 --> 25:28.567
they don't write a handbook on that.

25:28.587 --> 25:29.948
Believe me, I know.

25:29.982 --> 25:31.856
It's probably best just to
stand back,

25:31.876 --> 25:32.851
let 'em hash it out.

25:32.885 --> 25:36.388
Yeah. Because we all know
how well that works.

25:36.422 --> 25:39.724
Look, I just wanna set a good
example for Georgie and Katie.

25:39.759 --> 25:41.526
Show them that we're all on
the same team.

25:41.561 --> 25:44.563
We did it!

25:44.597 --> 25:46.498
Georgie roped her steer.
Buddy knew his job perfectly.

25:46.532 --> 25:47.999
- That's amazing!
- He's awesome!

25:48.034 --> 25:49.835
I knew Buddy could do it.

25:49.869 --> 25:51.102
Grandpa, have you ridden him yet?

25:51.137 --> 25:52.470
Yeah, have you?

25:52.505 --> 25:56.074
You should. You really should.

25:56.108 --> 25:59.311
I see what's going on here.

25:59.345 --> 26:01.446
You didn't need my "expertise."

26:01.480 --> 26:04.783
You wanted me to get
interested in that horse.

26:04.817 --> 26:07.252
Well, Buddy needs a new owner and you
need a new horse. It's a win-win.

26:07.286 --> 26:10.010
If any of you had been
listening,

26:10.030 --> 26:11.756
you'd know that I don't need a
new horse

26:11.791 --> 26:14.426
and I certainly don't need all
of you telling me I do.

26:14.460 --> 26:15.827
Well, if you just see us
compete in Casey's event,

26:15.862 --> 26:17.939
you'll see what he can do!

26:18.137 --> 26:20.532
Good luck with that. I hope
you win.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.269
- You are coming, right?
- I don't think so.

26:25.062 --> 26:27.305
Fine.

26:27.728 --> 26:30.342
Grandpa, I understand why
you're mad,

26:30.376 --> 26:32.377
but Georgie has been bending
over backwards all week

26:32.411 --> 26:34.012
just to get you to notice Buddy.

26:34.046 --> 26:36.147
I didn't ask her to do anything.

26:36.182 --> 26:38.250
What is she doing wrong? She
has empathy for you.

26:38.284 --> 26:40.418
She wants to help you.

26:40.453 --> 26:43.133
Those are all qualities that
you taught her.

26:53.834 --> 26:54.950
- Hey.
- Yeah, hey.

26:54.970 --> 26:57.136
- Listen, I think we both said...
- I was hard on you the other day.

26:57.170 --> 27:00.072
- But, uh...
- Okay, you go.

27:00.107 --> 27:01.939
I was just gonna say uh...

27:01.959 --> 27:04.877
you know I think we both said
some things that we didn't mean.

27:04.912 --> 27:07.580
I've been watching you and
Lou for months now,

27:07.614 --> 27:10.550
go back and forth and back and
forth,

27:10.584 --> 27:12.518
trying to make it all okay
with the girls.

27:12.553 --> 27:15.578
I've been trying to understand.

27:15.598 --> 27:19.158
But the more I watch, the more
I just don't see

27:19.192 --> 27:21.961
how this separation is for the best.

27:21.995 --> 27:23.696
Yeah, well, it was necessary.

27:23.730 --> 27:26.144
Let me finish.

27:27.286 --> 27:28.868
I don't want you to have
regrets.

27:28.902 --> 27:31.551
I have regrets.

27:31.571 --> 27:34.340
After my split with Marion, it
took years

27:34.374 --> 27:37.143
for me to repair the damage
I'd done with my daughters.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.245
I know. I know that

27:39.279 --> 27:42.866
No, you don't know, Peter.
You really don't.

27:44.952 --> 27:47.853
Stop fooling yourself.

27:47.888 --> 27:49.355
There's gonna be a distance,
there's bound to be.

27:49.389 --> 27:51.624
You're just not here.

27:51.658 --> 27:54.160
See, in my case, I was so
focused on the rodeo

27:54.194 --> 27:57.121
and what I'd lost after my
accident

27:57.141 --> 28:00.099
that I'd forgotten about the
importance of my family.

28:00.133 --> 28:03.869
And now you are in Vancouver
and have a job,

28:03.904 --> 28:07.106
and you have tunnel vision.

28:07.140 --> 28:09.408
You're forgetting what matters.

28:26.833 --> 28:29.712
I hope you're not thinking
of quittin' because of me.

28:31.999 --> 28:34.100
It'd be a real shame to have
practiced all that roping

28:34.134 --> 28:36.535
and then not compete.

28:40.173 --> 28:41.741
I know I haven't been that
much fun

28:41.775 --> 28:44.443
to be around these days.

28:49.546 --> 28:50.787
Hey.

28:52.326 --> 28:55.488
I am gonna ride again,

28:55.522 --> 28:57.857
but it has to be on my time,
you understand?

28:57.891 --> 28:59.392
On my terms.

29:01.625 --> 29:02.662
Okay.

29:06.700 --> 29:10.640
So... if you want any shot
at winning,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.407
you... have three more obstacles
to get ready for, don't you?

29:14.441 --> 29:16.742
- Are you any good at setting up poles?
- The best.

29:16.777 --> 29:18.878
- What about branding?
- Even better.

29:24.818 --> 29:27.987
Ready, Buddy?

29:28.021 --> 29:31.190
Okay.

29:33.694 --> 29:36.095
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

29:36.129 --> 29:39.684
- Lou made you some muffins.
- Oh, thanks, Lou.

29:41.068 --> 29:42.835
Find a home for your patient yet?

29:42.869 --> 29:46.338
No. No luck.

29:46.373 --> 29:49.998
I do have a suggestion that
you're probably not gonna like.

29:51.499 --> 29:52.745
Don't say Bob.

29:52.779 --> 29:55.347
Ty, he did offer.

29:55.382 --> 29:57.149
I know, but I can't trust the guy,

29:57.184 --> 29:59.585
not after everything he's done.

29:59.619 --> 30:02.621
Bob isn't exactly my favourite
person in the world either,

30:02.656 --> 30:04.190
but at least the reserve would
give the coyote pup

30:04.224 --> 30:07.660
a chance to recover outside.

30:07.694 --> 30:09.495
Let's face it, Ty, we've sort
of run out of options.

30:09.529 --> 30:11.464
Hey...

30:13.967 --> 30:16.135
Come on.

30:21.335 --> 30:23.743
You're right.

30:24.003 --> 30:26.278
I know you're right.

30:26.313 --> 30:27.580
I can come with you if you like.

30:27.614 --> 30:30.716
No, no. Thank you, though.

30:30.751 --> 30:32.084
I think this is something I
have to do on my own.

30:42.095 --> 30:44.969
Hey. Can I give you a hand?

30:46.420 --> 30:47.885
Sure.

30:48.935 --> 30:50.870
Where's Peter? I thought he
was helping you out.

30:50.904 --> 30:53.363
He's up in the loft.

30:53.847 --> 30:57.582
Things seem to go faster if
we're not in the same space.

30:57.602 --> 30:59.545
Dad!

30:59.579 --> 31:01.247
I'm letting him help, Lou.
What more do you want?

31:01.281 --> 31:03.482
I want you two to get along.

31:03.517 --> 31:06.376
I want you to quit pushing his buttons.

31:12.024 --> 31:14.614
He's gonna regret choosing
his career over his family.

31:14.634 --> 31:16.862
That's all I'm saying.

31:16.897 --> 31:19.799
It's not that simple, Dad.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.534
And I know you're just trying
to help,

31:21.568 --> 31:23.969
but you're actually making
things worse.

31:24.004 --> 31:26.105
Does it matter at this point?

31:26.139 --> 31:29.341
It does matter. Dad, it
matters to me,

31:29.376 --> 31:32.778
and it matters to Georgie and
Katie, okay?

31:32.813 --> 31:35.247
Because as much as I love
Grandpa,

31:35.282 --> 31:36.982
I wish that he hadn't kept you
away from us

31:37.017 --> 31:40.553
after you broke up with Mom.

31:40.587 --> 31:43.455
That was... Dad,
that was really hard.

31:45.959 --> 31:48.727
I uh...

31:48.762 --> 31:51.864
I just don't want you doing
the same thing to Peter.

31:51.898 --> 31:54.633
I want him to feel comfortable
seeing his girls whenever he wants.

31:54.668 --> 31:56.969
And I don't want him avoiding Heartland

31:57.003 --> 32:00.961
because you two can't figure
out how to deal with each other.

32:12.819 --> 32:14.186
I got a truck full of paint
down here.

32:14.221 --> 32:16.222
I could use your help.

32:16.256 --> 32:18.958
Hey, Tim, we don't have to
like each other

32:18.992 --> 32:21.193
to be there for the girls,

32:21.228 --> 32:23.488
or to finish this loft for
that matter.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.993
That's one of the smarter
things you've ever said...

32:28.013 --> 32:29.635
General.

32:50.357 --> 32:51.790
You're about the last person
on the planet

32:51.825 --> 32:53.592
I thought I'd see here.

32:53.627 --> 32:57.696
I brought that coyote pup.
You still got room for him?

32:57.731 --> 33:00.207
It'll be about four months
until he can be released.

33:00.227 --> 33:01.741
No problem.

33:04.384 --> 33:06.307
Easy now. Easy.

33:10.143 --> 33:12.278
- What happened to this place?
- Nothing.

33:15.115 --> 33:17.283
Well, it's obviously not
nothing, man.

33:17.317 --> 33:18.617
I mean, I knew you were
irresponsible,

33:18.652 --> 33:20.252
but this takes it to a whole
new level.

33:20.287 --> 33:22.221
Look, I told you I turned in
the poachers.

33:22.255 --> 33:24.214
Why can't you get past that?

33:26.612 --> 33:28.694
The only reason you turned in those
poachers was to save your own skin.

33:28.728 --> 33:31.152
That wasn't a selfless act,
all right?

33:31.172 --> 33:33.689
You were trying to avoid being held
accountable for your part in the scheme.

33:33.709 --> 33:35.607
I turned myself in.

33:36.636 --> 33:39.238
I spent six weeks behind bars.
I served my time

33:39.272 --> 33:41.540
and the reserve almost went
under for it.

33:41.574 --> 33:42.875
So you may wanna get your
facts straight

33:42.909 --> 33:45.964
before you start flinging
around judgments.

33:49.816 --> 33:51.903
Shhh...

34:03.696 --> 34:06.980
I wanna welcome everyone
to the Hudson Cowboy Classic.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.795
Uh, Lisa Stillman and I would
like to thank

34:08.815 --> 34:11.215
all the riders and the
volunteers and sponsors

34:11.235 --> 34:13.362
who helped make this event possible.

34:13.382 --> 34:16.177
I'm pleased to announce that
we have 22 competitors today,

34:16.210 --> 34:18.513
ranging in age and skill level,

34:18.547 --> 34:22.183
including Hudson's very own
"Miracle Girl" Amy Fleming.

34:22.217 --> 34:24.085
Woo-hoo!

34:24.119 --> 34:25.585
You wanna tell everyone
how this works?

34:25.621 --> 34:27.522
Hi, everyone. As you can see
from the competitors board,

34:27.556 --> 34:30.558
the riders will be competing
in heats of two.

34:30.592 --> 34:32.427
To win this event, you have to
complete all the obstacles

34:32.460 --> 34:34.094
in the shortest amount of time.

34:34.129 --> 34:35.963
So, Georige, who am I paired with?

34:35.998 --> 34:38.498
- You'll never guess.
- Oh no.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.402
Oh yes! Amy Fleming, you are going down!

34:41.437 --> 34:42.937
We're riding against each other.

34:42.971 --> 34:44.438
Okay, well, at least we're last up.

34:44.473 --> 34:45.806
That'll give us a chance to
check out the competition.

34:48.976 --> 34:51.179
I don't think Jack's coming.

34:51.213 --> 34:52.547
I wouldn't worry about Grandpa.

34:52.581 --> 34:56.193
This is gonna be fun, trust me.

34:56.962 --> 34:59.787
So without further ado,
let's get this race started.

34:59.822 --> 35:02.557
Our, uh, first two competitors
are Travis Dunne on Tonquin

35:02.591 --> 35:04.525
and Liam Baker on Cloud.

35:06.995 --> 35:08.963
And they're off! Both
fast off the top

35:08.997 --> 35:10.198
as they head into the first challenge

35:10.232 --> 35:11.699
branding.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.243
Now the riders must
take two turns

35:22.277 --> 35:25.313
in opposite directions before
moving on to roping.

35:29.118 --> 35:32.253
Go, Travis!

35:32.287 --> 35:35.823
Go! Let's go!

35:42.765 --> 35:44.999
They're good.

35:45.033 --> 35:48.030
Yeah, but I think we can do better.

35:49.605 --> 35:50.972
And it looks like
Travis is dragging his rope.

35:51.006 --> 35:52.306
Both riders now in penalty.

35:55.611 --> 35:57.245
And now poles.

36:13.228 --> 36:15.296
These sliders were a stroke of genius.

36:15.330 --> 36:18.466
And it turns out cowboys love
sesame encrusted ahi tuna.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.301
Well, who knew? And I've
noticed a few of our guests

36:20.335 --> 36:22.303
enjoying your assortment of beers.

36:22.337 --> 36:24.505
Hmm... I think we might be onto something.

36:31.647 --> 36:34.119
Grandpa, over here!

36:38.821 --> 36:41.289
Well, it's time for our
final match up of the day.

36:41.323 --> 36:44.325
Amy Fleming riding her horse, Spartan,

36:44.359 --> 36:47.161
competing against Georgie
Fleming-Morris on Buddy.

36:48.997 --> 36:50.431
You're just in time here, Jack.

36:50.466 --> 36:51.866
Georgie and Amy are about to
go head to head.

36:51.900 --> 36:54.769
No kiddin'.

36:54.803 --> 36:56.604
Ladies, would you take your place
at the starting mark, please.

36:59.341 --> 37:02.043
- I'm glad you made it.
- Yeah, me too.

37:02.077 --> 37:03.444
Come on, Amy!

37:09.372 --> 37:11.252
You ready?

37:11.286 --> 37:13.888
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

37:13.922 --> 37:15.356
We've had a lot of
great showings this afternoon,

37:15.390 --> 37:19.026
but the rider to beat is still
Travis Dunne.

37:22.064 --> 37:25.833
That's it, come on!
Come on!

37:29.338 --> 37:33.174
Go, Georgie! Come on, Amy!

37:33.208 --> 37:34.542
And Georgie's in the lead,

37:34.576 --> 37:38.646
but don't count Amy out.
This race is neck in neck.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.816
Come on, Buddy, come on.

37:41.850 --> 37:43.751
Curl, curl, come on.

37:46.955 --> 37:49.657
Ungh! Come on!

37:49.691 --> 37:52.627
Get up, get up, get up!

37:54.396 --> 37:55.796
All right, Georgie's
done it!

37:55.831 --> 37:57.098
robping!

38:06.708 --> 38:10.811
Right there. You see that?
That's classic me.

38:15.584 --> 38:18.185
You see? Now she gets that
from me.

38:20.422 --> 38:21.822
Look at Georgie and
Buddy go.

38:21.857 --> 38:24.125
They're still in this.

38:24.159 --> 38:25.560
We're in the home
stretch, guys,

38:25.594 --> 38:26.961
let's cheer 'em on!

38:26.995 --> 38:29.664
Guys!

38:29.698 --> 38:32.567
Go, Buddy! Go!

38:32.601 --> 38:36.234
Georgie. Go,
Georgie.

38:48.517 --> 38:50.952
Oh wow, what a finish!

38:50.986 --> 38:54.522
Both were clean rides, no
penalties.

38:54.556 --> 38:57.091
Just let the judges tally the
points.

38:57.125 --> 39:00.208
Wow! That was amazing! You
did so good!

39:03.932 --> 39:06.133
And Amy Fleming has claimed
first place.

39:06.168 --> 39:08.102
And don't forget Georgie
Fleming-Morris on Buddy

39:08.136 --> 39:10.605
coming in second behind our
champion.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.540
I can't believe it!
I almost beat you!

39:15.444 --> 39:17.286
Good boy.

39:34.431 --> 39:36.131
Hey, Jack.

39:37.285 --> 39:39.969
You ran a good race, kid.

39:45.988 --> 39:49.910
You know, the only reason I
tried to push Buddy onto you

39:49.947 --> 39:53.166
is because I want you to be happy.

39:53.439 --> 39:57.320
Well, I appreciate you
looking out for me,

39:57.355 --> 39:59.656
even when I make it difficult.

40:03.361 --> 40:05.611
I know you miss Paint, but...

40:05.631 --> 40:09.135
it doesn't mean you can never
love another horse again.

40:10.868 --> 40:14.754
The truth is, I don't know
that I'm ready.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.130
Buddy's not a bad horse.

40:19.243 --> 40:21.578
He did okay out there today,

40:22.386 --> 40:25.181
but... that doesn't mean we'd
make a good team.

40:25.216 --> 40:28.283
Only one way to find out.

40:28.303 --> 40:30.253
Join-up is the best way to
establish a bond.

40:30.288 --> 40:31.988
You should give it a try.

40:33.185 --> 40:36.793
Amy, you know I
respect your methods

40:36.827 --> 40:39.921
and I admire everything you do
with your clients, but...

40:39.941 --> 40:42.974
I'm old school. That's not for me.

40:44.268 --> 40:47.071
A man and a horse,

40:47.915 --> 40:51.174
they either like each other or
they don't.

41:09.293 --> 41:12.076
Looks like he's making real
progress.

41:12.797 --> 41:14.197
If you're wondering about
the coyote pup,

41:14.231 --> 41:16.066
you could've just called.

41:18.689 --> 41:22.578
Bob, I'm sorry about what
happened to the reserve.

41:22.913 --> 41:26.876
I made a lot of mistakes in my
life, a lot...

41:28.646 --> 41:31.315
and I appreciated the second
chances that I got.

41:32.583 --> 41:34.250
So what're you saying?

41:41.858 --> 41:44.427
I'm saying let's put
it behind us.

41:44.812 --> 41:46.563
Forget about it.

41:54.979 --> 41:57.674
When Buddy wouldn't spin at
first, I thought I was done.

41:57.708 --> 41:59.042
Yeah, but you recovered
well.

41:59.076 --> 42:01.511
- Yeah, and you almost beat me.
- Almost.

42:01.545 --> 42:03.713
It made for a very exciting finish.

42:03.748 --> 42:06.449
Well, now that we know how much the
English riding crowd loved the event,

42:06.484 --> 42:08.752
It'll probably be much easier
to organize next time.

42:08.786 --> 42:10.754
Next time?

42:10.788 --> 42:12.756
I think we should make this
take-out.

42:12.790 --> 42:14.991
Got a lot of work to do and I
wanna finish what we started.

42:15.026 --> 42:16.693
Yup, I'm with you. Whenever you're ready.

42:16.713 --> 42:17.560
I'm in too.

42:17.580 --> 42:19.963
I say we finish the bathroom first.

42:19.997 --> 42:21.431
Oh, hey you know what I'm
thinking?

42:21.465 --> 42:23.466
Uh, what about pot lights?

42:23.501 --> 42:25.635
Pot lights? No, because it's
a barn. So really?

42:25.670 --> 42:29.072
Okay, so who still needs
lasagna?

42:29.106 --> 42:31.574
