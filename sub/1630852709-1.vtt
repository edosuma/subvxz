<i>Good morning, Camp Splinterwood!</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:11.696
<i>As you head out to your next activity,</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:13.323
be sure to look out for--

01:13.406 --> 01:14.783
Care packages!

01:16.868 --> 01:17.786
Huh?

01:18.578 --> 01:19.412
Huh?!

01:19.496 --> 01:21.581
Ooh! Oh!

01:25.168 --> 01:26.836


01:28.338 --> 01:30.006
Whew!

01:30.089 --> 01:32.133


01:32.217 --> 01:34.511

<i>Have a Splinterwood-iful day!</i>

01:43.394 --> 01:46.606
Look, I know our counselors expect us
to… shoot some hoops,

01:46.689 --> 01:48.650
but sports isn't really my thing-- Ow!

01:48.733 --> 01:51.027
So, why don't we… take it easy and--

01:51.110 --> 01:52.570
Will you stop that?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.322
Oh…

01:54.405 --> 01:55.532
Neiderflyer.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.992
Uh, this basketbird court is taken.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.327
We were here first!

01:59.410 --> 02:00.954
You want to fight for it?

02:01.037 --> 02:02.330
Oh, please say yes.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.083
I can't even remember the last time
I was in a fight.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.418
Um, just now, in Arts and Crafts?

02:08.545 --> 02:10.672
You got a problem, vase?

02:12.257 --> 02:17.220
I'll tell you what. I'll let one of you
shoot for it. Make it, take it.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.348
Look, Neiderflyer, you're being
as charming as always.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.977
By which I mean, not charming at all.
But, how dumb do you think we are?

02:24.060 --> 02:26.146
Should I shoot from over here? Or here?

02:26.229 --> 02:27.313
How about here?

02:27.397 --> 02:30.275

How about over here?

02:30.358 --> 02:31.568
Chuck! I'm open!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.446
Ugh!

02:35.530 --> 02:36.865
-Oh!
-Ah!

02:36.948 --> 02:39.534
Oh yeah. In your beak--

02:39.617 --> 02:41.411
-Yoink!

02:41.494 --> 02:44.330
No. Not you. Him.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.498
Uh…

02:45.582 --> 02:47.458
Okay, it's all on you.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.794
This is it. One shot for the win.
No pressure.

02:49.878 --> 02:53.131
Okay, maybe some pressure.
Maybe a lot of pressure.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.048
But it's okay.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.217
Just don't think about the pressure!

02:56.301 --> 02:59.971
Not helping, Chuck. Bomb, you got this.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.444
Ahh!

03:25.371 --> 03:27.123
And that is game.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.545
Hey, look! It's a care package
somebird's parents flung from home.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.963
Looks like a nice one, too.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.006
We'll take that.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.050
I don't see your name on it, Neiderflyer.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.676
I don't see yours either, Maroon.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.887
Come on, you know my name is Red.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.140
So sorry, did I say maroon? I meant moron.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.433
That's it!

03:48.436 --> 03:50.438
Yes, that is it!

03:50.521 --> 03:52.106
Hi, Matilda.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.528
Oh my. Your chakras… they are just--

03:57.612 --> 03:59.781
Ooh, they are bursting with energy,
aren't they?

03:59.864 --> 04:00.698
Uh-huh.

04:00.782 --> 04:05.286
Anyhoo, like I was saying, that is it!
My campers' care package.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.122
I thank you and the universe
for finding it.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.918
No problem. I mean, what kind of jerk
would take candy from a hatchling?

04:15.213 --> 04:16.464
Cabin raid!

04:18.800 --> 04:20.635
Guess that answers my question.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.056
How could Neiderflyer do that?

04:25.139 --> 04:27.016
It makes me angry!

04:27.100 --> 04:29.936
And when I get mad, I get--

04:30.019 --> 04:31.062
Lunch!

04:31.562 --> 04:32.772
I guess I get lunch.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.607
But after lunch, I get even.

04:34.691 --> 04:39.028
I'm gonna raid Neiderflyer's bunk
and get the hatchlings' care package back!

04:40.238 --> 04:41.781
Now, we just need a plan.

04:41.864 --> 04:44.117
Okay, okay, plan.
Ooh! I got it.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.910
Bomb blows up Neiderflyer's cabin

04:45.994 --> 04:48.538
while the rest of us use paddles
to tunnel in from below.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.915
Wait, no, that's a terrible idea.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.125
Okay, forget that.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.420
So we push Neiderflyer's bunk to the lake,
float it onto the water,

04:55.503 --> 04:57.505
and then swing over
from the bungee rope course

04:57.588 --> 04:59.173
and board it like pirates.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.508
Arrh! Ha ha ha.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.176
Actually, that's a dumb idea, too.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.555
How about we borrow nurses' uniforms
from the infirmary

05:05.638 --> 05:08.766
and then quarantine
Neiderflyer's bunk for bird flu…

05:08.850 --> 05:10.852
-No, that's a plan--
-Hey wait!

05:10.935 --> 05:13.187
This one's not so crazy.
This could actually work.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.107
Give it to me straight. It's bad, right?

05:17.608 --> 05:19.610
Look, I'm not going to lie to you.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.237
It's bad.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.454
And here you go.

05:29.537 --> 05:33.082
I can't believe that worked
and without any consequences whatsoever.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.584
Up top!

05:34.667 --> 05:36.502
Cabin raid.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.006
-Whoa!

05:45.178 --> 05:48.890
-You put them in Terence's cabin?
-Yup.

05:48.973 --> 05:52.101
Why are you doing this? This seems like
way too much effort for you.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.979
Maybe because I never get care packages.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.733
Or maybe I'm just bored.
Slow day at the office.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.359
Neider-jerk.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.195


06:02.278 --> 06:04.238
He's here.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.495
Droppings!

06:10.578 --> 06:13.456
Okay, look, yes,
Terence is on the large side,

06:13.539 --> 06:14.832
but how tough can he really--

06:14.916 --> 06:17.502
Is he bench pressing his cabin?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.048
We gotta get the hatchlings out!

06:22.131 --> 06:26.052
Yeah, you guys seem to have this
under control, so I'm just gonna--

06:28.346 --> 06:29.639
This is my fault.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.683
If I hadn't gotten mad, the hatchlings
wouldn't be in this mess.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.560
I gotta learn to control myself.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.896
What? No, Red.

06:36.979 --> 06:40.316
You getting angry and making sure
bullies and jerks don't ruin our summer,

06:40.399 --> 06:42.902
that's what makes this the best camp ever!

06:42.985 --> 06:44.904
Well, that and the marshmallows.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.865
Ugh! You're crushing my hollow bird bones.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.617
Thanks.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.160
And thanks for saying all that, buddy.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.163
Yeah, I never knew you could talk
that much. I like it.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.958
Me too. And you're right.
We gotta fix this.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.628
By pulling one last raid
on Terence's cabin.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.547
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait!

07:02.630 --> 07:07.802
No, no, no, no! I meant we should go
tell our counselor… Mighty Eagle.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.639
Sorry, boys, I got bigger problems.

07:11.722 --> 07:15.143
This bod? It's not gonna tan itself.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.186
That's literally how tanning works.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.272
Yeah, that's-- that's great, guys.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.899
Hey, ladies, got any extra sunblock?

07:21.983 --> 07:25.403
-I got a lot of real estate to cover here.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.947
Ugh! I guess it does have to be us.

07:28.030 --> 07:31.033
Okay, we're gonna need
an amazing plan

07:31.117 --> 07:33.536
because if Terence even suspects
we messed with his bunk,

07:33.619 --> 07:36.038
he'll stomp our beaks
straight out of our butts!

07:36.122 --> 07:38.833
You don't need to come up with a plan.
You already did!

07:38.916 --> 07:41.711
I did? I thought my plans
were too crazy to work.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.546
They totally were, on their own.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.215
But put them together and you got a plan
that's so cuckoo insane,

07:46.299 --> 07:47.967
it just might work!

07:56.392 --> 07:58.561
Come on, you gotta explode.

07:58.644 --> 08:02.231
The whole plan starts with you blowing up,
so don't blow it, I mean, do blow it!

08:02.315 --> 08:03.524
Not helping.

08:03.608 --> 08:04.901
Maybe this will.

08:05.443 --> 08:10.406
Chuck said the hatchlings were in trouble,
and the only thing that will help is this.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.909
Fire in the face hole!

08:30.468 --> 08:31.719
Everybody out!

08:33.012 --> 08:35.556
Two, three, four. Yup, we're all here.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.225
Including him!

08:42.313 --> 08:44.232
We're too far away for him
to see who we are!

08:44.315 --> 08:46.275
Terence doesn't know
which campers to pound!

08:46.359 --> 08:47.235
What are you doing?

08:47.318 --> 08:49.820
Making sure Terence knows who to pound!

08:49.904 --> 08:52.573
-That's a terrible idea.
-If I can just--

09:03.834 --> 09:05.002
Everybody off!

09:09.757 --> 09:11.008
Bomb's away!

09:11.092 --> 09:12.218
You got it.

09:12.301 --> 09:16.138
No! I meant Bomb's away from where
he was gonna catch me!

09:17.848 --> 09:19.016
I'm fine.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.309
Oh, thank you!

09:20.393 --> 09:22.311
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

09:22.395 --> 09:24.689
Uh, could you hold these for a second?

09:28.776 --> 09:30.570
Stella, jump.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.363
You don't have to crash
and burn with me.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.948
You're dang right I don't.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.867
Ever since kindergarten
you've been getting me in trouble.

09:36.951 --> 09:40.538
And if you think I'd miss a minute of it,
you're insane!

09:40.621 --> 09:42.456
Ha ha! Whoo-hoo!

09:44.959 --> 09:48.087
Oh, I can't wait to dig into this thing.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.931
What? How did your cabin get here?

10:01.517 --> 10:04.437
I-- I didn't-- No, please don't pound me.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.814
Please don't pound me! No!

10:09.734 --> 10:11.861
I believe this is yours.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.405


10:14.488 --> 10:17.241
Aw. They'd like to share it with you.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.035
-Sweet.
-Gimme, gimme, gimme!

10:23.956 --> 10:26.834
After all that I would have thought
this would taste better.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.503
That's probably because it's underwear.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.713
Ahh!

10:33.341 --> 10:35.384


10:35.468 --> 10:37.762


10:37.845 --> 10:39.263

Mommy!
