WEBVTT

00:04.104 --> 00:05.939
So what's on the agenda for tonight?

00:05.971 --> 00:09.543
I thought we might just
have a quiet night in.

00:09.575 --> 00:11.844
Come on.

00:13.622 --> 00:14.880
This way, Madame.

00:16.838 --> 00:19.306
What did you do?

00:26.916 --> 00:28.818
Thank you.

00:28.851 --> 00:29.953
You're out of your mind!

00:33.689 --> 00:35.892
It's spectacular.

00:35.924 --> 00:38.227
Happy anniversary.

00:38.428 --> 00:40.262
Happy anniversary.

00:48.436 --> 00:51.406
Hey, his lips are moving.

00:51.439 --> 00:53.334
You think he's trying to say something?

00:53.375 --> 00:55.345
Most likely an involuntary response

00:55.378 --> 00:57.607
to something in the Reverie program.

00:57.912 --> 00:59.682
Well, how can you know for sure?

00:59.714 --> 01:01.986
We can't.

01:02.618 --> 01:04.753
They brought in another one
this morning.

01:07.149 --> 01:08.291
That makes seven.

01:08.356 --> 01:09.725
I can count.

01:09.758 --> 01:11.360
I know you can count.

01:11.393 --> 01:12.743
What if this becomes an epidemic?

01:12.782 --> 01:14.997
Seven users isn't an epidemic.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.732
It's a fraction of a fraction.

01:16.765 --> 01:19.368
They're in a coma, Lexi...

01:19.467 --> 01:21.166
because of your program.

01:21.236 --> 01:23.319
My program is doing
exactly what it's supposed to.

01:23.361 --> 01:24.662
That's not going to make
a damn bit of difference

01:24.703 --> 01:25.752
to our partners.

01:25.791 --> 01:28.066
If we can't prove
that this is reversible,

01:28.099 --> 01:30.101
they're gonna pull the plug.

01:30.134 --> 01:32.301
We'll lose everything.

01:32.543 --> 01:34.072
Do you understand?

01:39.143 --> 01:40.878
This is a radical problem.

01:42.879 --> 01:45.082
Maybe it requires a radical solution.

02:03.768 --> 02:06.021
Now, remember,

02:06.536 --> 02:08.437
only 7% of our communication

02:08.479 --> 02:10.801
is based on what we actually say.

02:11.674 --> 02:13.778
38% of it comes from
the tone of the voice,

02:13.810 --> 02:18.545
and the rest of it, 55%,
comes from body language.

02:22.786 --> 02:25.272
Look at the smiles.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.723
Real smiles... they affect the eyes.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.450
They wrinkle the skin.

02:29.527 --> 02:31.973
Is the person making eye contact?

02:32.219 --> 02:33.821
Too much? Not enough?

02:33.884 --> 02:35.786
Oh...

02:37.767 --> 02:40.604
Also pay attention to the direction.

02:40.637 --> 02:41.905
Eyes to the left means that

02:41.939 --> 02:43.107
they're trying to remember something.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.616
Eyes to the right

02:44.674 --> 02:46.788
signals creative thinking,

02:46.844 --> 02:48.412
deception.

02:48.515 --> 02:50.359
Stop.

02:50.447 --> 02:52.984
Devon is the killer.

02:53.049 --> 02:54.618
How'd you figure it out?

02:54.652 --> 02:55.952
Everyone else was, like, really intense

02:55.986 --> 02:57.088
with their eye contact,

02:57.120 --> 02:58.494
and Devon looked away immediately,

02:58.557 --> 03:00.090
like she had something to hide.

03:00.124 --> 03:01.908
That's very good.

03:01.971 --> 03:04.796
Now, remember, this is more
than just a game, right?

03:04.835 --> 03:07.005
I mean, these are skills
that you can use

03:07.030 --> 03:08.131
on a job interview,

03:08.165 --> 03:10.978
on a date, or in bed.

03:12.837 --> 03:15.506
It's a whole new way
of seeing the world,

03:15.539 --> 03:19.076
but you have to look up.

03:24.714 --> 03:27.617
And class is dismissed.

03:27.650 --> 03:29.019
All right, good work, everybody.

03:29.053 --> 03:31.189
We'll see you on Wednesday.

03:34.225 --> 03:35.593
Charlie,

03:35.625 --> 03:37.594
what are you doing here?

03:37.628 --> 03:39.564
Buy you dinner?

03:39.596 --> 03:42.533
How does one teach
interpersonal dynamics?

03:42.565 --> 03:44.077
You saw it. We play "killer,"

03:44.124 --> 03:45.210
we play "red light, green light,"

03:45.265 --> 03:47.771
games that develop observational skills.

03:47.804 --> 03:49.673
And their parents pay money for this?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.608
Well, if their parents knew
how badly they needed it,

03:51.642 --> 03:52.971
- they'd pay twice as much.
- Here you go.

03:52.996 --> 03:54.043
Why do you say that?

03:54.068 --> 03:55.112
- Thank you.
- Sure.

03:55.144 --> 03:56.137
Do you know how much time

03:56.176 --> 03:58.082
the average teen spends
on their devices in one day?

03:58.114 --> 03:59.816
- How much?
- Nine hours,

03:59.850 --> 04:02.753
and in some cases, up to 16 or more.

04:02.785 --> 04:04.120
And in exchange for that,

04:04.154 --> 04:06.023
they get the whole world
in their pocket, right?

04:06.055 --> 04:09.226
Any information, any tool,
right there on their phone.

04:09.268 --> 04:10.970
Is that such a bad thing?

04:10.994 --> 04:12.863
It is if they're not developing

04:12.897 --> 04:14.308
the most important tool of all.

04:14.333 --> 04:15.867
Which is?

04:15.900 --> 04:17.101
Empathy.

04:17.134 --> 04:19.101
We learn empathy by observing,

04:19.136 --> 04:20.237
and we've stopped doing that.

04:20.271 --> 04:22.726
I mean, look.

04:22.939 --> 04:25.942
Nobody's even having
an actual conversation.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.978
- Well, we are.
- Yeah, but that's because

04:28.011 --> 04:29.413
we haven't seen each other
in a few years,

04:29.455 --> 04:32.264
and we have a lot to catch up on.

04:32.749 --> 04:34.584
Want to offer you a job, Mara.

04:36.186 --> 04:37.989
Okay, doing what?

04:38.021 --> 04:40.524
What you did for me on the force:

04:40.588 --> 04:42.790
hostage negotiation.

04:47.230 --> 04:49.369
When I retired as police chief,

04:49.439 --> 04:51.067
I started my private security firm.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.490
Onira-Tech was my first and only client,

04:53.623 --> 04:56.584
and then after a time,
I became a liaison.

05:02.146 --> 05:04.015
"Reverie." What does it do?

05:04.047 --> 05:06.716
What's your all-time favorite memory?

05:06.757 --> 05:08.661
The most beautiful, mind-blowing place

05:08.686 --> 05:10.939
you can remember?

05:13.178 --> 05:15.948
Uh, when I was, um, ten...

05:17.761 --> 05:20.804
My mother took me and my sister Jamie

05:21.331 --> 05:23.166
to this place called
"labyrinth of light."

05:23.241 --> 05:26.218
It was this

05:26.369 --> 05:29.172
field just full of paper lanterns.

05:30.874 --> 05:34.562
It was like floating in space.

05:34.677 --> 05:36.247
What if you could revisit that moment

05:36.280 --> 05:37.648
any time you wanted?

05:37.681 --> 05:39.250
It can do all that?

05:39.283 --> 05:40.884
Reverie is a place

05:40.917 --> 05:43.754
where the impossible becomes possible.

05:43.787 --> 05:46.924
You're put inside a waking
dream of your own design.

05:46.956 --> 05:50.415
You can go anywhere you want,
change your appearance,

05:50.652 --> 05:53.337
and even bring loved ones
back from the dead.

05:53.376 --> 05:54.438
How?

05:54.479 --> 05:57.234
They use what's called a
"social media footprint."

05:57.266 --> 05:59.941
A person's pictures, videos...

06:00.103 --> 06:01.597
their posts.

06:01.739 --> 06:04.159
You feed them into the program,

06:04.307 --> 06:07.152
and you can resurrect them in Reverie.

06:07.903 --> 06:10.074
That's like a field trip to heaven.

06:10.114 --> 06:12.950
Problem is, some of our users
are so addicted

06:13.002 --> 06:15.018
to the fantastic worlds they've created

06:15.043 --> 06:18.379
that their subconscious minds
have severed ties with reality.

06:18.422 --> 06:20.791
Their bodies have gone into a coma.

06:20.823 --> 06:23.326
For lack of a better word,
they're trapped.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.362
I'm still not understanding.

06:25.396 --> 06:27.698
What exactly is it
that you want me to do?

06:27.730 --> 06:29.766
I want you to go inside Reverie

06:29.799 --> 06:31.302
and bring them back.

06:33.836 --> 06:35.905
<i>How would you like to proceed?</i>

06:35.939 --> 06:37.775
She needs time to think about it.

06:37.807 --> 06:39.709
<i>Charlie, we don't have time.</i>

06:39.742 --> 06:41.978
Monica, she's our best option.

06:42.011 --> 06:45.182
Well, you've got her résumé.
See for yourself.

06:47.985 --> 06:50.388
<i>Master's of Psychology from Stanford.</i>

06:53.057 --> 06:56.694
<i>Specialized counterterrorism
training with the FBI.</i>

06:56.727 --> 06:58.328
<i>There have to be others.</i>

06:58.362 --> 07:00.698
<i>The best negotiators make you feel like</i>

07:00.730 --> 07:03.293
<i>you've known them your whole life.</i>

07:03.726 --> 07:05.970
<i>They're attuned to every response:</i>

07:06.002 --> 07:08.271
<i>every little gesture of the hand,</i>

07:08.304 --> 07:10.174
<i>slight change in tone of voice.</i>

07:10.206 --> 07:12.308
<i>She had all that.</i>

07:12.341 --> 07:15.311
<i>She worked miracles
for complete strangers.</i>

07:18.215 --> 07:19.950
<i>Unfortunately, she couldn't do it</i>

07:19.982 --> 07:22.336
<i>for the people she loved the most.</i>

07:29.359 --> 07:32.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ray, Ray.

07:32.795 --> 07:34.898
Okay, so just, uh...
Just back up a second.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.734
You know? Tell me how all of this

07:36.766 --> 07:38.101
got started.

07:38.134 --> 07:40.198
- I found a text.
- Okay, a text, good.

07:40.237 --> 07:41.706
- What text?
- On Jamie's phone.

07:41.739 --> 07:43.140
A text on Jamie's phone. Great.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.144
What did it say?

07:44.169 --> 07:46.476
That she's taking Brynn
to your parents' place.

07:46.509 --> 07:49.412
- She's gonna leave me.
- Okay, wait, wait.

07:49.446 --> 07:51.948
Ray, listen.

07:51.982 --> 07:53.451
I'm sure it wasn't permanent, all right?

07:53.484 --> 07:54.785
I-I-I...

07:54.818 --> 07:57.188
Maybe she just wanted
to give you guys some space.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.618
I know my sister.

07:58.665 --> 08:00.191
I know how much she loves you.

08:00.223 --> 08:01.925
Not anymore.

08:01.958 --> 08:04.461
No, of course she does.

08:04.494 --> 08:06.362
Remember when you used to

08:06.396 --> 08:08.331
come to our house and you would

08:08.371 --> 08:09.741
pick her up for dates

08:09.766 --> 08:11.134
and you would drive around in that car.

08:11.159 --> 08:12.427
God, what was it? It was the, um...

08:12.468 --> 08:14.204
The... the... The black one...

08:14.237 --> 08:16.840
- The Camaro?
- The Camaro, exactly.

08:16.894 --> 08:19.176
Whatever happened to that car, anyway?

08:19.208 --> 08:20.477
I sold it...

08:22.637 --> 08:24.348
To, uh, buy Jamie's ring.

08:29.252 --> 08:30.453
I'm sorry, baby.

08:30.487 --> 08:32.155
Daddy didn't mean to scare you.

08:32.188 --> 08:33.789
I didn't mean to scare you.
Everything's going to be...

08:40.087 --> 08:42.991
- Did you call the police?
- Mara...

08:43.015 --> 08:44.936
No! No, no.

08:44.961 --> 08:46.912
- I-I... No, no, no.
- Oh, I told you

08:46.951 --> 08:48.587
- not to call the police!
- They're going to go away.

08:48.642 --> 08:50.908
No, I didn't!
I'm gonna make them go away.

08:50.937 --> 08:52.525
Please, please...

08:52.572 --> 08:55.513
Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

09:42.679 --> 09:45.839
Version 1.0 was
a single-user experience,

09:45.864 --> 09:48.379
but for the past year,
I've been working on 2.0,

09:48.411 --> 09:49.877
which is multi-user.

09:49.911 --> 09:51.815
It allows two people to interact

09:51.848 --> 09:54.417
in a shared immersive virtual world.

09:54.442 --> 09:57.145
The commercial version
won't be available for a while,

09:57.179 --> 09:59.382
but we built a prototype.

09:59.415 --> 10:01.090
It's the only one like it in the world.

10:01.161 --> 10:04.132
2.0 is what you'd use
to enter each client's Reverie.

10:06.968 --> 10:10.072
<i>Bio-authentication complete, Charlie.</i>

10:10.104 --> 10:11.940
Thank you, Dylan.

10:11.973 --> 10:13.575
And Dylan is...

10:13.608 --> 10:15.510
Everywhere.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.479
He's the building's AI.

10:17.512 --> 10:20.482
Dylan, say hello to Miss Kint.

10:20.514 --> 10:21.949
<i>Hello, Miss Kint.</i>

10:21.983 --> 10:23.886
<i>Enjoy the rest of your tour.</i>

10:24.518 --> 10:26.187
Trust me,

10:26.220 --> 10:29.167
you're just getting to the weird part.

10:29.316 --> 10:32.586
This is the BCI...
the brain-computer interface

10:32.627 --> 10:34.863
that runs the program.

10:39.935 --> 10:41.236
Is it moving?

10:41.268 --> 10:43.238
It's been integrated with living tissue.

10:43.271 --> 10:46.575
It helps merge with the body
in a more symbiotic way.

10:46.608 --> 10:48.109
It makes it impossible

10:48.142 --> 10:50.112
to distinguish the program from reality.

10:50.145 --> 10:51.380
But if it's an implant,

10:51.412 --> 10:54.115
can't you just surgically remove it?

10:54.148 --> 10:55.917
The flow of data is laced into

10:55.950 --> 10:57.051
the central nervous system,

10:57.084 --> 10:58.519
which then carries it to

10:58.552 --> 11:00.054
the cortical neurons.

11:00.088 --> 11:02.156
Severing the connection while someone is

11:02.190 --> 11:03.592
this deeply connected

11:03.624 --> 11:06.160
might cause permanent damage.

11:06.194 --> 11:08.397
If you decide to do this,

11:08.430 --> 11:10.965
you'll have to undergo
the implant procedure as well.

11:14.002 --> 11:16.471
Tony Lenton was the first.

11:17.238 --> 11:19.932
Now we've got a whole damn wing.

11:21.309 --> 11:24.079
Every one of these people
decided that life in Reverie

11:24.112 --> 11:26.081
is better than the one out here.

11:26.113 --> 11:28.583
This is a chance to bring
families back together again.

11:31.518 --> 11:34.422
I thought that'd be something
you'd be interested in.

12:13.027 --> 12:14.562
Do you have, like, a, um...

12:14.595 --> 12:16.130
Like, a smaller gun

12:16.163 --> 12:17.732
that you could use?

12:25.639 --> 12:27.675
Wasn't so bad now, was it?

12:38.786 --> 12:41.089
I see you found your way home.

12:41.122 --> 12:42.724
When you find this symbol in Reverie,

12:42.757 --> 12:44.426
you're looking at a gateway icon,

12:44.459 --> 12:46.560
your exit back to the real world.

12:49.097 --> 12:51.400
It's beautiful.

12:51.432 --> 12:53.567
Mandalas represent the universe.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.070
I thought it was appropriate.

12:55.103 --> 12:56.137
Uh, Paul Hammond,

12:56.171 --> 12:57.738
chief oneirologist.

12:57.772 --> 12:59.273
Uh, Mara Kint.

12:59.306 --> 13:00.915
What's an oneirologist?

13:00.940 --> 13:03.178
Usually, it means someone involved in

13:03.210 --> 13:04.854
the science of studying dreams.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.716
Here, it's the science
of creating dreams.

13:07.748 --> 13:11.253
I design all the factory
presets and training modules.

13:11.286 --> 13:13.220
We also do research and development,

13:13.253 --> 13:16.190
pushing the boundaries
of reality within the program.

13:16.224 --> 13:18.794
The ordinary user can choose
between the presets

13:18.826 --> 13:20.661
or a more customized experience.

13:20.695 --> 13:22.296
They can create entire worlds

13:22.329 --> 13:23.831
tailored to their specific desires,

13:23.864 --> 13:27.435
and they have days, weeks,
even months to figure it out,

13:27.469 --> 13:29.237
but I'm going to give you
a crash course,

13:29.270 --> 13:30.805
just enough to make you dangerous.

13:32.281 --> 13:34.443
Please, have a seat.

13:42.883 --> 13:44.152
Make yourself comfortable.

13:44.185 --> 13:46.036
Yeah.

13:48.790 --> 13:50.692
<i>Apertus</i> means "open."

13:50.724 --> 13:52.226
Whenever you're ready,

13:52.259 --> 13:53.561
just say the word,

13:53.594 --> 13:54.762
close your eyes,

13:54.796 --> 13:56.730
and you'll find yourself in the box.

13:56.763 --> 13:57.865
The box?

13:57.898 --> 13:59.567
It's a training module.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.302
Shall we begin?

14:01.335 --> 14:03.334
Okay.

14:05.573 --> 14:07.175
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.577
If you make it all the way through,

14:08.609 --> 14:10.445
there's a surprise
waiting for you at the end.

14:10.485 --> 14:11.519
What is it?

14:11.546 --> 14:13.581
Well, if I told you,
it wouldn't be a surprise,

14:13.614 --> 14:15.316
now would it?

14:15.349 --> 14:16.517
When you're ready.

14:23.858 --> 14:25.127
<i>Apertus.</i>

14:58.560 --> 15:00.862
<i>What if I want to walk around?</i>

15:00.895 --> 15:02.697
<i>Your brain tells your limbs what to do,</i>

15:02.729 --> 15:04.166
<i>but those signals are connected</i>

15:04.199 --> 15:05.767
<i>to your body in Reverie.</i>

15:07.502 --> 15:09.171
<i>Aside from a few stray reactions</i>

15:09.204 --> 15:10.530
<i>to really powerful stimuli,</i>

15:10.555 --> 15:12.373
your body will remain perfectly still,

15:12.406 --> 15:14.276
right here in this chair.

15:14.309 --> 15:17.579
So I can do anything I want?

15:17.612 --> 15:20.482
<i>Physical laws don't
necessarily apply in Reverie,</i>

15:20.514 --> 15:23.450
<i>but they are subject to
the limitations of the coding.</i>

15:23.483 --> 15:25.219
<i>For instance, you can't just
pop off and fly.</i>

15:26.988 --> 15:28.790
Well, yet.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.635
<i>Can I get hurt?</i>

15:40.667 --> 15:43.470
<i>You can teach your brain
to disarm certain triggers,</i>

15:43.503 --> 15:45.728
<i>like pain, for example.</i>

15:46.840 --> 15:50.411
<i>Over time, you'll learn to override
your natural instincts</i>

15:50.452 --> 15:51.986
<i>and deprogram your fear response.</i>

16:11.599 --> 16:12.600
Holy...

16:27.212 --> 16:30.215
Uh, hello?

16:30.295 --> 16:32.531
Okay, uh...

16:35.614 --> 16:37.858
- Hello?
<i>- Once you're inside,</i>

16:37.892 --> 16:39.728
<i>we don't have any way to communicate.</i>

16:39.761 --> 16:40.862
No! No!

16:40.895 --> 16:42.464
Paul! Paul!

16:42.497 --> 16:43.865
<i>So if it gets too intense,</i>

16:43.897 --> 16:45.633
<i>look for a gateway icon.</i>

16:47.206 --> 16:49.804
If there isn't one nearby,
all you have to do

16:49.836 --> 16:51.338
is say <i>"exitus."</i>

16:54.809 --> 16:55.877
<i>Exitus!</i>

17:01.983 --> 17:03.685
Intense, right?

17:09.648 --> 17:11.518
You don't have to do this right now.

17:11.542 --> 17:13.194
Training's enough for one day.

17:13.220 --> 17:14.904
He may not have another day.

17:14.929 --> 17:16.498
I wanna get started.

17:21.701 --> 17:23.976
You never should have
suggested using 2.0.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.250
What was I supposed to do?

17:25.275 --> 17:26.647
You were supposed to wait
until we figured out

17:26.673 --> 17:27.765
the derealization issues.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.472
The company could have been
long gone by then,

17:29.497 --> 17:32.281
and these people might already be dead.

17:32.837 --> 17:33.940
You said it yourself:

17:33.972 --> 17:36.209
she picked it up faster than we did,
and we built it.

17:36.241 --> 17:37.943
But it's not just her, Alexis.

17:37.977 --> 17:39.245
It's the program itself.

17:39.278 --> 17:40.858
We have no idea what's gonna happen

17:40.883 --> 17:42.490
when we introduce a second person.

17:42.515 --> 17:45.351
Her presence might disrupt
Tony's bond with the program.

17:45.383 --> 17:47.787
Exactly. This is our chance to find out.

17:51.190 --> 17:52.924
I'm gonna monitor her brainwave activity

17:52.958 --> 17:54.259
when she goes in.

17:54.293 --> 17:55.828
If there are significant anomalies,

17:55.861 --> 17:57.229
then we have to tell her.

17:57.262 --> 17:59.865
If you don't, I will.

18:02.835 --> 18:06.481
Jay, when was the last time
you talked to your brother?

18:06.806 --> 18:08.841
He called a couple weeks ago,

18:08.874 --> 18:12.310
asked if we wouldn't mind
keeping Iris for the weekend.

18:12.344 --> 18:15.373
We got a daughter the same age,

18:15.521 --> 18:16.844
her cousin.

18:16.915 --> 18:18.316
I figured he just, you know,

18:18.349 --> 18:20.952
needed some time by himself.

18:20.986 --> 18:22.188
He's been under a lot of pressure

18:22.220 --> 18:24.489
ever since her mom passed.

18:24.522 --> 18:26.158
What happened to her?

18:26.191 --> 18:28.528
They were in an accident.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.128
My brother was driving.

18:30.162 --> 18:32.999
Naomi was in the passenger seat.

18:33.031 --> 18:35.000
He survived, but

18:35.034 --> 18:37.170
she didn't make it to the hospital.

18:39.838 --> 18:42.240
<i>Last few months, he's been collecting</i>

18:42.274 --> 18:43.543
<i>everything he could find.</i>

18:44.529 --> 18:46.898
<i>Pictures, video...</i>

18:46.979 --> 18:49.420
<i>Old voice mails.</i>

18:49.622 --> 18:51.424
I didn't know what
he was doing at the time,

18:51.498 --> 18:56.154
but apparently he was
uploading them to the program.

18:58.457 --> 19:01.127
He thought he could bring her back.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.829
<i>How's the training going?</i>

19:02.862 --> 19:05.331
She passed the early stages
faster than anyone else.

19:05.364 --> 19:08.034
<i>She's gone through
a battery of simulations.</i>

19:09.367 --> 19:11.136
<i>Her vitals are steady.</i>

19:42.968 --> 19:45.137
<i>If you make it all the way
through to the end,</i>

19:45.170 --> 19:47.172
<i>there's a surprise waiting for you.</i>

20:29.315 --> 20:31.083
<i>Charlie, we're running out of time.</i>

20:31.115 --> 20:32.350
<i>Is she ready or not?</i>

20:32.383 --> 20:35.220
Yes, she's ready.

20:35.254 --> 20:36.689
<i>Then send her in.</i>

20:36.721 --> 20:39.991
This tablet is paired with
Tony Lenton's program.

20:40.025 --> 20:41.789
When you tap the icon
and open your eyes,

20:41.898 --> 20:44.262
you'll find yourself inside his Reverie.

20:51.170 --> 20:52.971
Good luck.

20:53.005 --> 20:54.573
<i>Apertus.</i>

21:10.021 --> 21:11.222
Come on.

21:33.511 --> 21:35.080
Wait, let me get in it! Let me get in!

21:48.794 --> 21:50.528
Whoa!

23:49.381 --> 23:50.883
Who are you?

23:53.751 --> 23:55.253
My name is Mara.

23:55.287 --> 23:57.355
You're not supposed to be here.

23:57.389 --> 23:58.591
No?

23:58.624 --> 24:01.773
I was very specific about my choices.

24:02.468 --> 24:04.337
Okay, I... I have to tell you something.

24:04.363 --> 24:05.951
I want you to go.

24:05.976 --> 24:07.466
But just give me five minutes.

24:07.499 --> 24:09.902
- For what?
- To talk about Naomi.

24:09.934 --> 24:11.470
How do you know that name?

24:12.637 --> 24:14.405
Five minutes, please.

24:21.512 --> 24:23.318
Tony?

24:23.382 --> 24:25.396
You're gonna crash the program.

24:25.443 --> 24:28.482
You have to go.
You're gonna ruin everything.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.415
Tony! Tony!

24:33.459 --> 24:37.193
- I said I want you to go!
- Tony, please!

24:42.518 --> 24:44.565
<i>Exitus!</i>

24:45.158 --> 24:46.757
It's okay. Just breathe.

24:48.790 --> 24:51.157
I got the wind knocked out of me.

24:51.561 --> 24:54.454
No, you just thought you did.

24:54.831 --> 24:57.601
I was monitoring your brainwave activity

24:57.626 --> 24:59.938
There was a pretty radical
spike in the middle.

25:00.008 --> 25:03.575
Do you remember seeing
anything particularly strange?

25:07.059 --> 25:10.216
No.

25:14.362 --> 25:16.530
I remember that book.

25:16.563 --> 25:18.266
You know, after I read it,

25:18.300 --> 25:20.002
I used to go outside

25:20.034 --> 25:22.127
and pretend that I could talk to birds.

25:22.182 --> 25:24.572
My grandma had a parakeet named Libby.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.292
She talked to it all the time.

25:26.342 --> 25:28.377
Oh yeah? Well, did it talk back?

25:28.402 --> 25:30.271
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:30.305 --> 25:32.975
Yeah, but it could only say two things:

25:33.008 --> 25:35.277
"I love you" and a swear word.

25:39.014 --> 25:40.849
She and my mom used to read it to me

25:40.910 --> 25:42.546
before I went to sleep.

25:44.819 --> 25:47.349
Hey, Iris, can I ask you a question

25:47.386 --> 25:49.622
about your mom and your stepdad?

25:49.725 --> 25:52.294
Did they ever talk about San Francisco?

25:52.326 --> 25:55.230
That's where he asked her to marry him.

25:55.264 --> 25:56.832
They didn't have any money,

25:56.864 --> 25:58.666
but he paid some guy, like,

25:58.700 --> 26:01.269
$10 to let them on the roof of a hotel.

26:01.303 --> 26:03.505
It sounds like you've heard
that story a few times.

26:03.537 --> 26:04.940
More like a hundred,

26:04.972 --> 26:06.508
but I didn't mind.

26:06.540 --> 26:09.344
They were always so happy
when they talked about it.

26:12.948 --> 26:14.883
Is he gonna be okay?

26:16.817 --> 26:18.586
I promise,

26:18.620 --> 26:21.230
I'm gonna do everything I can

26:21.324 --> 26:22.624
to bring him back.

26:30.065 --> 26:32.351
Dylan?

26:33.067 --> 26:35.430
<i>Yes, Miss Kint?</i>

26:36.671 --> 26:38.454
Uh, well, first of all,

26:38.516 --> 26:41.696
- you can call me Mara.
<i>- I like that name.</i>

26:41.777 --> 26:43.634
- Thank you.<i>
- Hebrew origin.</i>

26:43.704 --> 26:44.813
<i>It means "bitter."</i>

26:44.845 --> 26:47.749
I've heard that before, yes.

26:47.783 --> 26:48.950
Listen, Dylan,

26:48.983 --> 26:50.952
can you do a search for me

26:50.986 --> 26:52.821
of all the images that Tony Lenton

26:52.854 --> 26:54.856
uploaded to Reverie?

26:54.890 --> 26:56.959
<i>Of course. What should I look for?</i>

26:56.991 --> 26:59.894
A butterfly.

26:59.928 --> 27:01.630
<i>Searching.</i>

27:01.662 --> 27:04.532
You know, if you add an "H" to "Mara,"

27:04.566 --> 27:07.736
it could also be
the Arabic word for joy?

27:07.768 --> 27:09.904
<i>I like it either way.</i>

27:09.938 --> 27:11.073
That's very sweet.

27:11.105 --> 27:12.740
<i>I found three results,</i>

27:12.774 --> 27:15.011
<i>and here.</i>

27:18.899 --> 27:21.373
Okay, that's not it, but wait.

27:23.499 --> 27:25.368
That's not it, either.

27:25.451 --> 27:27.443
- Who's the blond one?
<i>- Allison Young.</i>

27:27.506 --> 27:30.884
<i>She's in 630 of Naomi's photos.</i>

27:30.925 --> 27:33.561
Uh, can you get me an address?

27:33.594 --> 27:36.931
<i>Sure, but she's not home right now.</i>

27:36.956 --> 27:38.325
- No? <i>
- According to</i>

27:38.366 --> 27:39.434
<i>her status update,</i>

27:39.468 --> 27:41.436
<i>she just clocked in at work.</i>

27:43.971 --> 27:47.095
- Are you a police officer?
- No. Well, I mean,

27:47.243 --> 27:48.608
I used to be,

27:48.658 --> 27:51.557
but now I work for this company
called Onira-Tech.

27:51.613 --> 27:52.980
Uh, they make this immersive

27:53.014 --> 27:55.601
virtual reality program called Reverie.

27:56.076 --> 27:57.845
And what does this have to do with Tony?

27:57.885 --> 27:59.954
Well, he logged on to the program...

27:59.988 --> 28:01.724
thank you... two weeks ago,

28:01.757 --> 28:04.215
and he never came back out.

28:04.285 --> 28:07.929
He's gone kind of into a coma,
and he could die.

28:07.996 --> 28:11.793
So, were you close to them?

28:11.866 --> 28:14.245
Naomi was my best friend.

28:14.673 --> 28:17.144
- Were they happy?
- Of course.

28:17.245 --> 28:20.041
Did they have any problems
that you knew of?

28:20.107 --> 28:22.885
I mean, in their marriage?

28:22.943 --> 28:25.578
They were stronger than ever.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.937
They had to be, with everything
she was going through.

28:27.984 --> 28:30.875
What do you mean?
What was she going through?

28:31.620 --> 28:33.589
Naomi was sick.

28:33.622 --> 28:35.879
They were fighting with it for a while,

28:35.990 --> 28:39.460
but she took a turn for the worse.

28:39.494 --> 28:41.897
They didn't want anyone else to know,

28:41.930 --> 28:44.933
not until they had a chance
to tell Iris.

28:55.376 --> 28:58.138
<i>Tony Lenton's condition
is getting worse.</i>

29:00.515 --> 29:01.717
How long do we have?

29:01.742 --> 29:03.815
A couple of days at most.

29:04.052 --> 29:05.510
<i>And there's one more thing.</i>

29:05.587 --> 29:07.455
<i>I finished reviewing</i>

29:07.721 --> 29:10.260
<i>Mara Kint's EEG.</i>

29:10.691 --> 29:11.859
Who ordered that?

29:11.893 --> 29:13.027
Paul Hammond.

29:15.864 --> 29:17.199
<i>He wanted me to take a look at</i>

29:17.231 --> 29:19.429
<i>a spike in the middle of her session,</i>

29:19.522 --> 29:21.780
<i>but that's not what has me concerned.</i>

29:22.037 --> 29:23.604
<i>There were other markers,</i>

29:23.637 --> 29:25.506
<i>things that could potentially indicate</i>

29:25.539 --> 29:27.675
<i>an underlying psychiatric disorder.</i>

29:37.046 --> 29:39.473
I found this in Tony's apartment.

29:39.791 --> 29:40.959
It's called Skeiron.

29:41.056 --> 29:42.691
Popular with college kids.

29:42.723 --> 29:43.991
Helps them get through finals.

29:44.025 --> 29:45.960
What does this have to do with Tony?

29:46.002 --> 29:47.971
There was a butterfly in his Reverie.

29:47.996 --> 29:49.670
He had a strong negative reaction to it,

29:49.717 --> 29:50.998
and I got the feeling that this

29:51.031 --> 29:52.700
was not the first time that it happened.

29:52.733 --> 29:54.502
That could be a by-product
of his connection

29:54.536 --> 29:56.939
to the deep learning program.

29:56.971 --> 29:58.239
Everyone's brain is a little different,

29:58.273 --> 29:59.640
so their relationship to

29:59.672 --> 30:00.975
the program is gonna be different.

30:01.008 --> 30:03.492
Like how we respond to certain drugs
in different ways.

30:03.539 --> 30:04.680
Exactly.

30:04.712 --> 30:07.248
Maybe it misread his connection
to the butterfly,

30:07.281 --> 30:09.050
mistaking it for love as opposed to

30:09.084 --> 30:10.786
some other powerful emotion.

30:10.818 --> 30:12.720
Like what?

30:12.754 --> 30:13.956
Guilt.

30:16.345 --> 30:18.079
I wanna go back in.

30:35.576 --> 30:36.777
<i>Apertus.</i>

31:00.735 --> 31:02.104
Wait, wait, wait!

31:03.971 --> 31:05.574
Hey, you.

31:05.606 --> 31:08.143
I told you to stay away from me.

31:09.744 --> 31:11.747
I know why you're seeing the butterfly.

31:14.649 --> 31:16.151
Who are you?

31:23.892 --> 31:26.628
My name is Mara Kint.

31:26.661 --> 31:28.830
I work for Onira-Tech.

31:28.863 --> 31:30.744
How are you here?

31:30.832 --> 31:33.830
There's a multi-user version of Reverie,

31:33.994 --> 31:37.004
and they sent me into your program
to talk to you.

31:37.037 --> 31:38.172
Why?

31:38.206 --> 31:40.108
I didn't consent to this.

31:44.778 --> 31:47.316
You have no right to be here.

31:47.348 --> 31:49.227
You're right. I don't.

31:49.252 --> 31:50.786
I'm intruding,

31:50.818 --> 31:51.961
and I'm very sorry for that.

31:52.024 --> 31:55.352
This place is obviously
important to you.

31:55.407 --> 31:57.292
You proposed to her here.

31:57.325 --> 31:59.618
Is that right?

31:59.825 --> 32:02.454
It must have been very special.

32:03.198 --> 32:06.634
I had this whole
elaborate evening planned,

32:06.668 --> 32:10.178
but when the bellhop kicked us out,

32:10.561 --> 32:12.039
we hopped on a cable car

32:12.073 --> 32:14.717
and just spend the rest of the
night just

32:14.909 --> 32:16.670
riding around the city.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.951
It sounds like a night to remember.

32:19.054 --> 32:20.689
Have you ever had a night like that?

32:20.714 --> 32:23.785
Yes, and I have one
I'd do anything to forget.

32:25.618 --> 32:27.121
Just like you.

32:28.957 --> 32:30.859
Will you tell me what happened?

32:30.892 --> 32:34.796
Everything, uh, changed
after the diagnosis.

32:34.828 --> 32:37.965
We burned through our savings
in the first two months.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.634
I'm an independent contractor.

32:39.672 --> 32:41.670
She was in grad school.

32:41.702 --> 32:44.071
Neither one of us had insurance,

32:44.104 --> 32:45.572
so I took a second job with my cousin,

32:45.640 --> 32:48.228
doing 80-, 90-hour weeks,

32:48.582 --> 32:50.884
taking her for treatment in between

32:51.011 --> 32:53.801
getting Iris to and from school.

32:54.181 --> 32:57.105
So you started taking Skeiron.

32:57.719 --> 32:59.988
I shoulda had someone else take her

33:00.020 --> 33:01.789
to the clinic that day.

33:01.823 --> 33:04.893
I was at the end of 30 straight days.

33:04.925 --> 33:06.827
I doubled up on the dosage.

33:09.130 --> 33:11.794
I don't even remember the accident.

33:11.865 --> 33:14.688
I just woke up in the hospital,

33:14.969 --> 33:17.446
and she was gone.

33:17.771 --> 33:19.807
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

33:24.471 --> 33:26.857
I failed her at every turn.

33:27.023 --> 33:28.858
I spent every day working,

33:28.883 --> 33:31.252
trying to keep her alive,
and it wasn't enough.

33:33.254 --> 33:35.664
Then I found Reverie.

33:37.092 --> 33:39.127
Our tenth anniversary was coming up,

33:39.160 --> 33:43.931
and we'd always talked about
coming back to this place,

33:43.964 --> 33:46.897
but we never got a chance.

33:47.268 --> 33:48.737
I could finally give her

33:48.769 --> 33:51.272
the dream weekend I always wanted.

33:51.806 --> 33:56.629
I'll forget for a minute or two
that it's not really her,

33:56.877 --> 33:58.813
that it's just a re-creation,

33:58.846 --> 34:00.181
but then something will happen

34:00.214 --> 34:02.364
that will remind me.

34:03.450 --> 34:05.053
I'm just...

34:05.085 --> 34:07.851
This is just never gonna go away, is it?

34:09.157 --> 34:11.193
No.

34:12.927 --> 34:15.079
But it'll get better.

34:15.429 --> 34:17.264
How would you know?

34:17.297 --> 34:19.000
Because you're not the only one here

34:19.032 --> 34:22.065
who feels responsible
for somebody's death.

34:22.929 --> 34:26.231
It's been two years, and, um...

34:26.775 --> 34:28.043
I'll be honest with you.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.304
I'm still kind of a mess.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.774
I started drinking too much.

34:34.815 --> 34:36.817
I started self-medicating.

34:36.851 --> 34:39.675
I didn't want to feel anything, and...

34:40.205 --> 34:42.239
It worked,

34:42.422 --> 34:44.409
for a while.

34:44.559 --> 34:46.027
What made you change?

34:46.059 --> 34:48.764
When I saw your brother and Iris

34:48.795 --> 34:51.793
- and what they were going through.
- Iris is here?

34:51.965 --> 34:53.926
The hospital called them in.

34:54.101 --> 34:56.254
You've gone into a coma.

34:56.371 --> 34:58.974
But I've only been in here
a couple days.

34:59.007 --> 35:02.244
You've been here for over two weeks.

35:02.376 --> 35:04.411
That... it's not possible.

35:04.650 --> 35:07.744
When was the last time
you remember sleeping?

35:08.983 --> 35:11.120
I don't...

35:12.554 --> 35:14.267
Tony,

35:14.354 --> 35:16.212
you have a version

35:16.356 --> 35:17.525
of Naomi here,

35:17.559 --> 35:20.943
but Iris is real.

35:21.390 --> 35:23.026
She is flesh and blood,

35:23.130 --> 35:25.123
and she's waiting for you,

35:25.199 --> 35:28.842
and if you stay here any longer,

35:30.137 --> 35:32.482
you will never come back,

35:33.903 --> 35:35.505
and she'll be all alone.

35:35.610 --> 35:37.445
Is that what you want?

35:41.014 --> 35:42.917
Is that what Naomi would want?

35:44.853 --> 35:46.954
Remember what you said that day?

35:46.987 --> 35:48.967
The proposal?

35:49.123 --> 35:50.858
I said, "You could do worse."

35:52.260 --> 35:54.553
I might have been wrong.

35:55.864 --> 35:57.398
What are you talking about?

35:57.432 --> 35:59.657
I let you down.

36:00.902 --> 36:02.790
I'm sorry.

36:03.103 --> 36:06.665
Tony, you never let me down.

36:07.148 --> 36:10.326
You did everything
you promised that day,

36:10.577 --> 36:11.998
and more.

36:12.112 --> 36:15.045
I don't regret a single second.

36:16.184 --> 36:17.452
I mean,

36:17.740 --> 36:21.359
how lucky are we
to have had this time together?

36:21.521 --> 36:22.623
The luckiest.

36:24.925 --> 36:26.494
But I think...

36:28.195 --> 36:30.498
I think it's time to go home.

37:08.063 --> 37:10.198
Dad...

37:10.379 --> 37:11.848
Tony.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.508
Welcome back, pal.

37:17.604 --> 37:19.939
She did it.

37:19.981 --> 37:21.383
Yep.

37:48.543 --> 37:50.045
Thank you.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.489
Thank you.

38:06.427 --> 38:07.996
You're welcome.

38:18.657 --> 38:20.726
You wanted to see me?

38:21.508 --> 38:24.079
Why did you order a EEG?

38:24.250 --> 38:25.952
We didn't know what would happen when we

38:25.992 --> 38:28.195
put a second person
inside someone's Reverie.

38:28.548 --> 38:30.612
We're in uncharted waters here.

38:30.717 --> 38:34.612
From now on, bring all
the results straight to me.

38:34.966 --> 38:36.815
If she sneezes,

38:37.632 --> 38:39.775
I want to know about it.

38:39.884 --> 38:41.162
Of course.

38:49.603 --> 38:52.482
- Dylan?
<i>- Yes, Lexi?</i>

38:52.911 --> 38:54.714
Want to play a game?

38:54.836 --> 38:57.716
<i>How about one of our old favorites?</i>

39:01.470 --> 39:04.074
Hm. It's perfect.

39:11.481 --> 39:14.142
We used to play this every day.

39:14.284 --> 39:16.186
<i>When we were young?</i>

39:19.588 --> 39:20.891
Yep.

39:22.691 --> 39:24.226
When we were young.

39:37.673 --> 39:40.817
There were four more cases
confirmed today.

39:41.311 --> 39:43.579
It's happening much faster now.
I... I...

39:43.612 --> 39:47.650
I can't help you keep it quiet
much longer.

39:47.684 --> 39:49.686
I understand.

39:49.719 --> 39:54.451
If your project tanks, I won't be
able to justify our investment.

39:55.258 --> 39:57.725
That would be a disappointment.

39:58.026 --> 40:01.231
I was hoping this would be
a long-term relationship.

40:03.398 --> 40:06.749
What are your long-term goals
for Onira-Tech?

40:06.835 --> 40:08.505
Or is that classified?

40:11.007 --> 40:12.342
Onira-Tech is

40:12.374 --> 40:13.849
one of a number of companies

40:13.888 --> 40:15.278
we have an interest in.

40:15.311 --> 40:17.180
And how does the Department of Defense

40:17.232 --> 40:19.316
see our product
working for them in the future?

40:19.349 --> 40:20.830
We don't know yet.

40:21.249 --> 40:23.799
We see potential.

42:13.757 --> 42:15.101
Brynn.
