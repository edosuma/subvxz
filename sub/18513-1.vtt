SANTA:
This is Christmastown in the North Pole.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.430
One of the things you need to know
is that everyone who lives here...

00:28.570 --> 00:32.406
is happy all the time. Really happy.

00:32.564 --> 00:35.808
I mean, really, really happy.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.609
Honestly, sometimes it's a bit much.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.979
But happiest of all was Buddy the Elf.

00:42.108 --> 00:46.284
Well, he wasn't really an elf,
but we'll get to that later.

00:46.446 --> 00:50.023
(SINGING) Christmas elves enjoy themselves
By donning gay apparel

00:50.183 --> 00:52.322
Or by singing songs in Santa's shop

00:52.485 --> 00:53.759
Fa-la-la, la-la, la-la-la

00:53.920 --> 00:57.477
Of course, I always like it
When they sing a Christmas carol

00:57.640 --> 01:00.671
I like it even better when they stop

01:01.494 --> 01:05.373
Night and day, they dance and play
They never sleep much either

01:05.532 --> 01:07.307
Would some peace and quiet be a crime?

01:07.467 --> 01:08.810
Fa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

01:08.968 --> 01:12.438
Of course, I love each one of them
But Santa needs a breather

01:12.605 --> 01:15.711
Because they're just so happy
all the time

01:15.875 --> 01:17.548
- They're oddly
- Happy all the time

01:17.710 --> 01:19.781
- Ungodly
- Happy all the time

01:19.946 --> 01:23.519
When they sing until they're bluish
Santa wishes he were Jewish

01:23.683 --> 01:25.219
- 'Cause they're
- Happy all the time

01:25.385 --> 01:27.387
- I swear they're
- Happy all the time

01:27.554 --> 01:31.525
- Bizarrely happy
- All the time

01:31.691 --> 01:35.138
SANTA: But there's an elf called Buddy
Who makes them look apathetic

01:35.295 --> 01:39.004
ALL: If he were any sweeter
We might end up diabetic

01:39.165 --> 01:42.476
SANTA: He's everybody's buddy
But he'll leave your eardrums ringing

01:42.635 --> 01:46.014
ALL: 'Cause everywhere he goes
He has to tell the world he's singing

01:46.172 --> 01:48.675
I'm singing

01:48.842 --> 01:52.221
It's almost Christmas and I'm singing

01:52.378 --> 01:56.224
And I love Santa, so I'm singing

01:56.382 --> 01:58.362
Buddy, you're standing on an elf again.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.395
I thought the floor felt squishy.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.191
Sorry, Ming Ming.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.390
That's okay, Buddy.

02:03.556 --> 02:07.168
(SINGING) My spine will heal
Because I'm happy all the time

02:08.394 --> 02:10.567
Okay, elves, you've got toys to make.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.641
Yay! Time to go to work.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.506
ALL (SINGING): Happy all the time

02:14.667 --> 02:16.078
Happy all the time

02:16.236 --> 02:19.877
Making toys is so appealing
That I spend each morning squealing

02:20.039 --> 02:21.518
True, he's happy all the time

02:21.674 --> 02:24.052
- Who knew? I'm happy all the time
- Happy all the time

02:24.210 --> 02:26.850
He's unnaturally happy

02:27.013 --> 02:32.395
All the time

02:32.552 --> 02:34.691
Happy all the time

02:34.854 --> 02:37.061
(CLATTERING)

02:37.223 --> 02:40.397
Oh, no. I made a big mess again.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.372
It's okay, Buddy.

02:44.097 --> 02:47.670
Why don't you just say it?
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.109
(WIND WHISTLING)

02:56.809 --> 02:59.085
I break everything I touch...

02:59.245 --> 03:00.918
I keep stepping on Ming Ming.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.493
And yesterday,
I only made 400 rocking horses.

03:04.651 --> 03:07.461
Sometimes I don't feel
like I'm an elf at all.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.655
(SIGHS)

03:08.821 --> 03:13.201
Well, Buddy, let me tell you a story
I should have told years ago.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.394
A story.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.563
Whoo-hoo! I love story time.

03:16.729 --> 03:19.676
Holy moly! My legs! My legs!

03:19.832 --> 03:21.812
- Aah!
- A story about your legs?

03:21.968 --> 03:23.311
I love it already.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.279
No, Buddy. Just listen.

03:26.506 --> 03:31.717
Once upon a time, on a Christmas night,
I slid down the chimney of an orphanage.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.620
While I was putting presents
under the tree...

03:34.781 --> 03:38.126
a baby crawled, unseen,
into my toy sack...

03:38.284 --> 03:40.730
and I brought him back here by mistake.

03:40.887 --> 03:45.029
Never having stolen a baby before,
I didn't know what to do.

03:45.191 --> 03:48.536
So the elves took him in
and raised him as one of their own.

03:48.695 --> 03:54.737
And as the years went on,
he grew bigger and bigger and bigger.

03:55.134 --> 03:58.775
Oh. So I'm a giant elf.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.179
- No. Buddy, you're...
- Wait.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.787
I thought this was a story
about your legs.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.617
No, this is your story.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.816
The story of Buddy the Elf.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.555
- Well, actually, Buddy the Human.
- Human?

04:12.719 --> 04:15.359
Your mother's name was Susan Wells.

04:15.521 --> 04:20.527
Now all you have left is your father,
who never knew you were born.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.832
His name is Walter Hobbs...

04:22.996 --> 04:26.739
and he lives in a strange land
called New York City.

04:26.899 --> 04:30.972
And he works right here
in the Empire State Building.

04:31.137 --> 04:32.616
BUDDY: In there? Ha-ha.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.979
Why, he must be teeny-tiny.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.621
Hello, Dad. Dad!

04:37.777 --> 04:41.020
No, don't be scared. I mean you no harm.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.091
This is just a snow globe, Buddy.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.160
Well, of course.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.162
I bet he's the world's greatest dad.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.823
Yeah, about that...

04:49.989 --> 04:51.900
So, what's the world's
greatest dad like?

04:52.058 --> 04:55.164
I mean, does he prefer candy canes
or peppermint sticks?

04:55.328 --> 04:57.569
Uh, he doesn't like either.

04:57.730 --> 05:02.338
Well, the world's greatest dad must have
a top-of-the-line, one-horse open sleigh.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.383
Well, then how does he dash
through the snow?

05:06.539 --> 05:12.182
You see, like a lot of people these days,
he's just lost the Christmas spirit.

05:12.345 --> 05:16.020
But Christmas spirit
is what makes your sleigh fly.

05:16.182 --> 05:20.130
And every year, it's tougher
to get this old girl off the ground.

05:20.286 --> 05:21.492
I guess it could be worse.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.965
- At least he's not on the Naughty List.
- Well...

05:25.124 --> 05:30.005
Can you imagine the world's greatest dad
a Naughty Lister?

05:30.163 --> 05:34.737
I mean, with their beady little eyes
and their naughty little hands...

05:34.901 --> 05:37.541
always grasping for presents
they don't deserve.

05:37.704 --> 05:38.739
Buddy.

05:38.905 --> 05:39.940

05:40.006 --> 05:42.052
Let's just cut to the chase.

05:42.208 --> 05:46.179

for over 50 years.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.485
(GASPS)

05:51.050 --> 05:53.894
Well, this is it. I'm all set to go.

05:54.053 --> 05:57.159
Now, Buddy, are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

05:57.323 --> 05:59.997
New York City can get a little rough.

06:00.159 --> 06:04.198
I've made my mind up, Santa.
I've got to get my dad off the Naughty List.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.844
Well then, good luck, Buddy.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.172
- Farewell, one and all.
- ALL: Bye.

06:09.335 --> 06:12.373
Now, do you remember the way
to New York City?

06:12.538 --> 06:13.642
BUDDY: Sure do.

06:13.806 --> 06:17.185
I go through the Cotton Candy Caverns,
brave the Gumdrop Ocean...

06:17.343 --> 06:20.916
trek through the Candy forest,
then straight on to New York.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.323
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.291
See you later, Buddy.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.264
Good luck finding your dad.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.267
Thanks, Mr. Sea Serpent.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.130
I'm coming, Papa.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.242
(SINGING) We'll make angels in the snow

06:39.399 --> 06:40.969
Till the snow begins to blow

06:41.134 --> 06:43.808
Then we'll run inside
and start a tickle fight

06:45.004 --> 06:48.110
And if it's too cold to sled
We'll eat gingerbread instead

06:48.274 --> 06:51.687
And then cuddle
till he tucks me in at night

06:51.844 --> 06:55.792
And we'll have our pictures taken
For the Christmas cards we're making

06:55.948 --> 06:58.656
Him and me in suits of matching plaid

06:58.818 --> 07:02.493
And when people see us walking
They'll be Google-eyed and gawking

07:02.655 --> 07:08.731
At Buddy and the world's greatest dad

07:09.395 --> 07:13.241
So I'm gonna try my best to be

07:13.399 --> 07:16.505
Everything you'd expect of me

07:16.669 --> 07:23.416
And I promise that I won't stop
until I'm done

07:23.576 --> 07:32.428
So someday you can say
I'm the world's greatest son

07:32.585 --> 07:34.258
Ooh! Sorry.

07:39.158 --> 07:40.967
Wow!

07:41.127 --> 07:42.697
It sure is a big city.

07:42.862 --> 07:45.843
How am I going to find Walter Hobbs?

07:45.998 --> 07:47.739

is finally back together again.

- My last name is Franklin.
- Oh.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.031
My name is Hobbs.

08:08.187 --> 08:11.566
Then you must be my father.
You're everything I imagined.

08:11.724 --> 08:15.365
I can't believe I found my dad,
Walter Hobbs.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.269
It's Jerry Hobbs.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.840
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.359
Of course not, Emily.
He's obviously delusional.

Let's pick out a Christmas tree tonight.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.736

in the living room.

Come on, Dad.
Where's your Christmas spirit?

08:59.739 --> 09:01.946
He's right. You're turning into a grump.

09:02.108 --> 09:04.918
Besides, we never do anything
as a family anymore.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.756
You know I'm too busy
for all that nonsense.

09:07.914 --> 09:11.225

your Christmas gift early?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.796
Uh, look, I gotta get back to work.

Michael, you know
your dad's a very busy man.

09:20.192 --> 09:24.197
Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we write Santa
and tell him what we want for Christmas?

09:24.597 --> 09:27.942
I don't believe in Santa.
All I know is what I don't want.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.779
MICHAEL (SINGING): I don't want a check

09:32.071 --> 09:34.278
That's made out to cash

09:34.440 --> 09:38.320
Or a corporate regift
from some secret stash

11:32.558 --> 11:36.563
It's about an outcast reindeer whose glowing
antlers help Santa through a bad storm.

11:36.729 --> 11:40.370
Yeah. We call it
Tony the Lite-Up Antlered Reindeer.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.807

It's the story of a grouchy green grouch
who hates Christmas, and then he...

Let me stop you right there,
my brilliant writers.

a Christmas-gram.

23:52.964 --> 23:57.071
Your mother claimed that she had proof
There were reindeer on the roof

23:57.235 --> 24:02.514
Remember who you were back then
Let those moments live again

24:02.674 --> 24:05.450
Come on, Jovie. Try it for me.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.819
(SINGING) Just sing a Christmas song

24:08.980 --> 24:10.015
That's it.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.924
It's like magic if things go wrong

24:13.084 --> 24:14.154
Keep going.

24:14.319 --> 24:17.732
Think of the joy you'll bring

24:17.889 --> 24:21.928
- If you just close your eyes
- If you just close your eyes

24:22.093 --> 24:25.802
- If you just close your eyes
- If you just close your eyes

24:25.964 --> 24:29.070
- If you just close your eyes
- If you just close your eyes

24:29.234 --> 24:34.707

- And sing

24:42.380 --> 24:44.360
Aw, shucks.

- CHADWICK: And so...
- Freezy, the green grouchy snowman...

24:50.021 --> 24:52.968
with the light-up antlers
flew through the terrible storm...

24:53.124 --> 24:56.401
and delivered the presents
to the Whys of Whyville.

24:56.561 --> 24:59.007
Merry Christmas, everyone.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.346
You know, maybe it's the eggnog talking,

25:01.496 --> 25:04.429
but this is the best idea
I've heard all year.

25:04.579 --> 25:07.583

you had elves working here.

Heh-heh.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.390
Very funny.

25:24.556 --> 25:25.660
No, this is...

25:25.824 --> 25:28.828
Oh, no. Did you leave your uniform
at Santa's workshop?

25:28.994 --> 25:30.974
That's okay, I have a spare.

25:31.129 --> 25:34.338
If this is supposed to be putting me
in the Christmas spirit...

25:34.499 --> 25:36.103

25:44.409 --> 25:48.050
You must have the smallest feet
in the whole North Pole.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.456
Tiny feet.
Look at your little tiny fee...

25:52.717 --> 25:57.097
Aah! I have never been so humiliated
in my life, Hobbs!

25:57.255 --> 26:00.793
And I can't believe I almost fell
for your song and dance!

26:00.959 --> 26:02.597

you'd better bring me an original idea!

Tomorrow night?
But that's Christmas Eve.

26:12.170 --> 26:15.982

the best Christmas story ever...

- Out where?
- I don't care. I don't care! Just go!

26:53.311 --> 26:54.551
SANTA: It was Christmas Eve...

26:54.713 --> 26:58.820
and Buddy had never been more unhappy
in his entire life.

26:58.984 --> 27:02.454
Because of those terrible things
Walter said to him...

through the streets of the city.

It's getting worse and worse every year.

27:45.563 --> 27:49.170
At least you're an elf. You don't have
to listen to kids telling you you're a fake.

Well, you are fake.

a little Christmas cheer.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.659
Years ago, kids would light up
when they saw you.

And everything I knew, I knew

32:36.788 --> 32:41.259
And everything that you knew too
Is absolutely now untrue because

32:41.426 --> 32:45.670
Without a doubt there is a Santa Claus

Come on. If that's Santa,
Buddy can't be far behind.

is powered by Christmas spirit...

these days.

Don't be so surprised, Hobbs.

36:10.268 --> 36:12.441
Of course, I'm on the Naughty List.

36:12.603 --> 36:16.210
Time to give up those presents, fatso!

36:16.374 --> 36:18.376
No way, José.

36:18.543 --> 36:22.719
Go spread as much Christmas cheer as you can
and we'll get that sleigh off the ground.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.382
Go, go, go.

36:26.884 --> 36:29.330
Get those presents!

36:29.487 --> 36:31.228
All right, Buddy.

36:31.389 --> 36:32.732
Lock and load.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.560
Let's do this.

36:37.795 --> 36:40.105
There's too many, Buddy. Hang on.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.636
Hyah! Hyah!

36:45.570 --> 36:47.982
MICHAEL:
Okay, let's spread some Christmas cheer.

36:48.139 --> 36:50.176
We can't let Buddy down.

36:50.341 --> 36:52.287
Buddy? Buddy the Elf?

36:52.577 --> 36:53.851
How do you know Buddy?

36:54.011 --> 36:55.422
He's the one who told me...

36:55.580 --> 37:00.359
the best way to spread Christmas cheer
is singing loud for all to hear.

37:00.518 --> 37:02.623
A song. That's a great idea.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.289
We should go out there and sing.

37:04.455 --> 37:07.163
Uh, I don't like singing
in front of people.

37:07.325 --> 37:10.306
Oh, where's your Christmas spirit?
Buddy needs us to do this.

37:10.461 --> 37:11.906
Walter, if she doesn't wanna sing...

37:12.063 --> 37:15.272
If Buddy's in trouble,
then I wanna help. Let's go.

37:23.574 --> 37:26.555
Come on, Jovie, you can do this.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.452
It's for Buddy.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.586
(SINGING) All you have to do

37:30.748 --> 37:34.628
Is move your voice much higher

37:34.785 --> 37:38.494
High, low, high, low

37:38.656 --> 37:41.535
High

37:42.893 --> 37:47.501
Just sing a Christmas song

37:47.665 --> 37:52.478
It's like magic if things go wrong

37:52.637 --> 37:56.744
Just spread some Christmas cheer

37:56.907 --> 38:01.083
By singing loud for all to hear

38:01.912 --> 38:06.122
Just sing a Christmas song

38:06.284 --> 38:10.994
And keep on singing all season long

38:11.155 --> 38:15.365
Think of the joy you'll bring

38:15.526 --> 38:19.599
If you just close your eyes and sing

38:21.966 --> 38:23.604
Give me those presents!

38:23.768 --> 38:26.009
Buddy, I don't think we can outrun them.

38:26.537 --> 38:29.279
BUDDY: We just need
a little more Christmas spirit.

38:30.441 --> 38:33.581
Come on, Dad. Sing.
Show some Christmas spirit.

38:35.646 --> 38:39.526
(SINGING) Just sing a Christmas song

38:39.684 --> 38:43.894
And keep on singing all season long

38:44.055 --> 38:47.730
Just sing a Christmas song

38:47.892 --> 38:52.398
And keep on singing all season long

38:52.930 --> 38:55.376
SANTA: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

38:56.701 --> 39:00.877
ALL (SINGING): And if you're short on cheer
Think about that year

39:01.038 --> 39:05.043
You woke up to find
A brand-new snow had fallen

39:05.209 --> 39:08.816
The ornaments you made
Way back in second grade

39:08.979 --> 39:13.485
Untangling the Christmas lights
Took your father several nights

39:13.651 --> 39:17.565
Your mother claimed that she had proof
There were reindeer on the roof

39:17.722 --> 39:23.638
Remember who you were back then
Let those moments live again

39:23.794 --> 39:26.434
Live again

39:28.699 --> 39:29.734
BUDDY: Whoa!

39:30.234 --> 39:31.770
(GRUNTS)

39:32.636 --> 39:33.842
I'm okay.

39:34.004 --> 39:35.642
SANTA: Good job, everybody.

39:35.806 --> 39:40.221
Santa's got his mojo back.
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

39:40.478 --> 39:43.891
You want a ride back to the North Pole,
Buddy?

39:44.048 --> 39:47.154
No, thanks, Santa. I'm happy here.

39:47.318 --> 39:48.922
This is Jovie.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.066
I think she's my girlfriend.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.793
Heh, heh, heh. Hi, Santa.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.837
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

39:56.994 --> 39:58.996
Oh, no.

39:59.997 --> 40:01.772
I don't have any presents.

40:03.934 --> 40:07.643
ALL (SINGING):
Just sing a Christmas song

40:07.805 --> 40:12.311
It's like magic if things go wrong

40:12.476 --> 40:17.289
Think of the joy you'll bring
If you just close your eyes

40:17.448 --> 40:18.859
If you just close your eyes

40:19.016 --> 40:21.121
SANTA: Now, that's the spirit.

40:21.285 --> 40:26.997
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all, a good night!

40:28.692 --> 40:33.664
ALL (SINGING): And sing

40:34.532 --> 40:37.741
This is the most amazing
Christmas Eve ever!

40:37.902 --> 40:40.644
Yeah. I don't even care
that I quit my job.

40:40.805 --> 40:42.375
I quit my job.

40:42.540 --> 40:43.712
What are we gonna do?

40:43.874 --> 40:45.979
We'll just cut back on some things.

40:46.143 --> 40:49.989
- You still got each other.
- And one heck of a story, Mr. Hobbs.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.148
(GASPS)

40:51.315 --> 40:53.852
A story. That's it.

40:59.890 --> 41:01.369
(SINGING) Page one

41:01.525 --> 41:05.940
Fresh out of toys
Santa makes his way back

41:06.664 --> 41:12.876
When he hears a small noise
From inside of his pack

41:13.571 --> 41:16.643
A sound that's not unlike a baby's cry

41:16.807 --> 41:20.846
It's enough to leave
the jolly guy perplexed

41:21.011 --> 41:22.046
And?

41:22.213 --> 41:24.625
(SINGING)
Come on, Buddy, what comes next?

41:24.782 --> 41:25.954
Page two

41:26.116 --> 41:29.757
Back from his ride
Santa gathers his elves

41:29.920 --> 41:31.365
ELVES (SINGING): He gathers his elves

41:31.522 --> 41:37.632
BUDDY: And they quickly decide
They'll raise the baby themselves

41:37.795 --> 41:41.038
The North Pole
Isn't made for humans, though

41:41.198 --> 41:45.442
And soon the phony elf
Begins to grow so tall

41:45.603 --> 41:49.141
- He
- Learns he's human after all

41:50.074 --> 41:53.453
ALL: It's the story of Buddy the Elf

41:53.611 --> 41:56.820
It's the story of Buddy the Elf

41:56.981 --> 41:58.392
It's the story of

41:58.549 --> 42:01.689
WALTER: And the books
will fly right off the shelf

42:01.852 --> 42:05.231
ALL: It's the story of Buddy the Elf

42:06.524 --> 42:09.994
And maybe Buddy helps his dad

42:10.160 --> 42:11.662
In a setting much like this

42:11.829 --> 42:12.864
(TIRES SCREECHING)

42:13.030 --> 42:19.811
And maybe his father learns
A son is something he can't dismiss

42:19.970 --> 42:26.785
They might learn that they need each other
Much more than they know

42:26.944 --> 42:33.418
Maybe the point of the story
Is it's never too late to grow

42:33.584 --> 42:35.791
It's never too late to grow

42:35.953 --> 42:39.093
ALL: It's the story of Buddy the Elf

42:39.256 --> 42:42.465
It's the story of Buddy the Elf

42:42.626 --> 42:44.003
It's the story of

42:44.161 --> 42:47.370
And the books will fly
right off the shelf

42:47.531 --> 42:52.844
It's the story of Buddy the Elf

42:53.003 --> 42:56.246
- SANTA: I love it, I love it, I do
- ALL: The elf

42:56.407 --> 42:59.149
- I love it, I love it, I do
- ALL: The elf

42:59.310 --> 43:02.780
I love the story
Love the story, love the story

43:02.947 --> 43:09.922
ALL: It's the story of Buddy

43:10.454 --> 43:11.626
And that's it.

43:11.789 --> 43:13.769
That's the story of Buddy the Elf...

43:13.924 --> 43:17.872
which has gone on to become the
best-selling children's book in the world.

43:18.028 --> 43:20.304
And it probably
won't come as a surprise to you...

43:20.464 --> 43:23.843
that they all lived happily ever after.

43:24.001 --> 43:26.242
Read it again. Read it again.

43:26.403 --> 43:28.713
Baby Buddy loves this story.

43:29.039 --> 43:30.814
(GIGGLING)

43:30.975 --> 43:32.010
(SANTA SIGHS)

43:32.176 --> 43:33.587
One more time.

43:33.744 --> 43:37.590
"This is Christmastown
in the North Pole..."
