07:39.960 --> 07:42.879
just snowball from there.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.589
So, how do I look?

07:44.631 --> 07:45.924
Under medicated.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.303
Very funny.

07:49.344 --> 07:53.223
You look radiant. Come on.

07:49.344 --> 07:53.223
Let's go. Bye, boys.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.350
- Don't I get a kiss?

07:53.265 --> 07:55.350
- Sure.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.684
Aah!

07:57.727 --> 07:59.313
Toodle-oo.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.148
Alright, guys.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.148
Mommy's gone.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.942
We gotta set some new

08:01.189 --> 08:03.942
ground rules around here.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.111
That's right,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.111
Katsopolis men do not

08:06.153 --> 08:09.948
I repeat,<i> do not</i> play

08:06.153 --> 08:09.948
with dolls, alright?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.199
Now, come on outside, guys,

08:09.990 --> 08:11.199
I'll teach you

08:11.241 --> 08:12.909
how to lube up my Harley.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.376
Alright, fine,

08:18.373 --> 08:21.376
play with the doll now

08:21.418 --> 08:23.086
but this isn't over.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.046
You guys have to

08:23.128 --> 08:25.046
nap sometime.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.882
[laughing]

08:28.716 --> 08:30.802
[instrumental music]

08:35.598 --> 08:38.143
Michelle,

08:35.598 --> 08:38.143
very good printing.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.728
But, is something missing

08:38.185 --> 08:40.728
from your letter I?

08:40.770 --> 08:43.231
I save the dots

08:40.770 --> 08:43.231
for last.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.942
I do too.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.987
Hey, Teddy,

08:45.984 --> 08:48.987
want to dot my I's?

08:49.029 --> 08:52.615
Ooh, that's

08:49.029 --> 08:52.615
my favorite thing.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.825
Wait a minute.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.370
First the secret,

08:53.867 --> 08:56.370
then the dots.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.497
Please!

08:58.538 --> 09:01.458
Don't do this to me.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.669
Then spill your guts.

09:04.711 --> 09:08.798
Okay, the secret is

09:04.711 --> 09:08.798
I'm going to Amarillo.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.885
What the heck is that?

09:11.926 --> 09:14.137
It's a place in Texas.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.639
That's it?

09:14.179 --> 09:16.639
You're going on vacation?

09:16.681 --> 09:19.267
Not your best secret.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.395
It's not a vacation.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.188
I'm moving there.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.231
What?

09:24.272 --> 09:27.567
Shh!

09:27.608 --> 09:28.985
You can't move.

09:30.862 --> 09:34.657
I have to.

09:30.862 --> 09:34.657
My dad got a new job.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.702
But we won't be

09:34.699 --> 09:37.702
best friends anymore.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.414
I know.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.414
It's bad news.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.375
Why didn't you tell me?

09:43.417 --> 09:46.086
Because I thought

09:43.417 --> 09:46.086
you'd be mad.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.295
Are you?

09:47.337 --> 09:48.338
No.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.341
I'm too sad...to be mad.

[dramatic music]

09:58.098 --> 09:59.682
[instrumental music]

10:02.477 --> 10:04.187
Oh, I'm sorry, Comet.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.187
This is not for you.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.023
I missed lunch.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.023
I was on the phone with Vicky.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.234
She canceled our

10:07.065 --> 10:09.234
long weekend together.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.986
'She has to fly back

10:09.276 --> 10:11.986
to Chicago tonight.'

10:12.028 --> 10:14.448
You think I'm making

10:12.028 --> 10:14.448
myself too nuts over this?

10:14.489 --> 10:17.158
Obviously,

10:14.489 --> 10:17.158
I'm talking to a dog.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.204
Hey, a meat loaf sandwich.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.706
Easy there, jaws.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.584
Sorry, sir. I don't

10:23.748 --> 10:25.584
wanna take your snack.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.295
Why not?

10:25.625 --> 10:28.295
I do it all the time.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.673
You have any friends

10:30.088 --> 10:32.673
whose parents feed them?

10:32.715 --> 10:34.801
Dad, stay cool.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.801
Steve's a wrestler.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.261
He needs his strength.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.637
What about Kimmy?

10:37.678 --> 10:40.265
Kimmy just

10:37.678 --> 10:40.265
has bad manners.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.600
I do not.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.227
You know, this meat loaf

10:41.641 --> 10:44.227
is really dry.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.396
Here you go, Comet.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.610
Well, uh,

10:49.149 --> 10:51.610
gotta go, Deej.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.111
I'll miss you.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.488
I'll miss you more.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.156
I'll miss you

10:54.529 --> 10:56.156
more than more.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.450
I'll miss you more

10:56.197 --> 10:58.450
than more than more.

10:58.492 --> 11:02.162
I bet she'd miss you

10:58.492 --> 11:02.162
even more if you were gone.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.873
Dad, look, there's

11:02.203 --> 11:05.873
a dust bunny under the table.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.250
That's impossible.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.715
There's nothing there.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.259
Sorry. My mistake.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.636
See ya.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.765
Dad, can I ride

11:18.845 --> 11:22.765
my bike to Amarillo?

11:22.807 --> 11:24.225
Uh, sorry, honey.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.436
It's a little

11:24.267 --> 11:26.436
too close to dinner.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.687
Besides, Amarillo's

11:26.478 --> 11:28.687
much too far.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.273
Not as far

11:28.729 --> 11:30.273
as Chicago, though.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.650
That's where Vicky lives.

11:31.690 --> 11:35.570
Alright, that's way past

11:31.690 --> 11:35.570
Utah, Colorado, Nevada.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.738
Then come all those

11:35.612 --> 11:37.738
really flat states.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.742
I get it. It's far.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.329
Boy, dad, you really

11:41.784 --> 11:44.329
miss Vicky, don't you?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.247
Well, why did she have

11:44.371 --> 11:46.247
to move to Chicago?

11:46.289 --> 11:47.957
It's cold. It's windy.

11:47.999 --> 11:51.127
Cubs never

11:47.999 --> 11:51.127
win the pennant.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.171
I know exactly

11:51.169 --> 11:53.171
how you feel.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.048
After lunch, when Steve

11:53.213 --> 11:55.048
goes to study hall

11:55.089 --> 11:56.591
and I go to geometry

11:56.633 --> 11:58.717
I miss him so much,

11:56.633 --> 11:58.717
I think I'll die

11:58.759 --> 12:01.429
before I see him

11:58.759 --> 12:01.429
again in Spanish.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.102
Yeah, but, this is

12:05.724 --> 12:08.102
a little different.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.396
Boy, it would be...be nice

12:09.437 --> 12:10.938
to be able to kiss my girlfriend

12:10.980 --> 12:13.608
without getting that yucky

12:10.980 --> 12:13.608
phone taste in my mouth.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.154
Maybe it's not worth it.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.281
Come on, dad.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.281
Vicky is so nice.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.949
Ya, I thought

12:20.323 --> 12:21.949
you liked her.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.201
I do like her.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.661
Just "like?"

12:24.703 --> 12:26.787
Yes, "like."

12:26.829 --> 12:28.164
A lot.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.084
But, it's driving me crazy

12:31.125 --> 12:34.128
having a girlfriend

12:31.125 --> 12:34.128
who's never in town.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.796
When Vicky comes over

12:34.170 --> 12:35.796
I'm-I'm gonna tell her

12:35.838 --> 12:38.508
that I think we should

12:35.838 --> 12:38.508
see other people.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.567
The moving truck's here.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.194
I guess I gotta say goodbye.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.862
I don't want you to go.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.282
Maybe, you could live

12:59.904 --> 13:02.282
at my house.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.491
I already asked.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.910
Mom says she would

13:03.533 --> 13:05.910
miss me too much.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.537
She could live here too.

13:07.579 --> 13:11.249
I don't think my dad

13:07.579 --> 13:11.249
would like that.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.668
Can't we play

13:11.291 --> 13:13.668
one last time?

13:13.710 --> 13:17.004
Okay, just for a minute,

13:13.710 --> 13:17.004
then I gotta go.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.881
I have a new jump rope.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.091
I don't know how.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.885
I'll teach you.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.885
It's really easy.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.147
I can do that.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.878

could grow up to be?

- No!

14:57.647 --> 15:00.274
- Just a guess.

He just might grow up

15:00.316 --> 15:03.653
to be a terrific father.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.154
did you tie up Teddy?

19:29.376 --> 19:32.379

Well, Michelle,

19:32.421 --> 19:33.923
tying up Teddy

19:33.965 --> 19:36.383
is not gonna

19:33.965 --> 19:36.383
stop him from moving.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.576
But, I don't want a new
