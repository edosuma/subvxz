WEBVTT

00:49.674 --> 00:54.803
THREE YEARS EARLIER

00:57.807 --> 01:01.226
I've found him, Mr. Winch.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.480
In the heart of the Burmese
jungle.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.484
In a Karen village.

01:10.695 --> 01:14.531
Largo has been living there
for three months.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.445
He met her

02:35.446 --> 02:38.949
when illegally crossing
the Thai-Burmese border.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.578
She took him to her village,
wounded, and he never left.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.623
Go back there.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.168
And keep your eye on him.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.044
What if he never came home?

02:51.045 --> 02:54.047
Don't be absurd, Freddy.

02:54.048 --> 02:58.302
He'll have to come
out of hiding one day.

03:01.014 --> 03:06.852
Whether he likes it or not,
Largo is my heir.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.818
THREE YEARS LATER

03:50.396 --> 03:52.522
Oh my God! Oh my God!

03:56.986 --> 03:59.947
AUTONOMOUS REPUBLIC
OF BASHKORTOSTAN

04:01.241 --> 04:02.824
"GPS: Find airport."

04:04.202 --> 04:07.412
You humiliated Nazatchov
before the press!

04:07.413 --> 04:09.289
He'll never forgive you.

04:09.290 --> 04:13.377
Find that son-of-a-bitch
Winch for me!

04:18.382 --> 04:21.718
And the journalist bitch, too!

04:23.513 --> 04:26.223
Why did you need to save her?

04:26.224 --> 04:29.017
Would you rather I'd been
killed?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.020
"Find the airport!"

04:32.021 --> 04:34.273
Forgive me, my Cyrillic is
rusty!

04:36.818 --> 04:38.402
I'll do it.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.906
I don't want to die here!

04:42.907 --> 04:46.326
I have a wife! Four children!
A career!

04:46.327 --> 04:49.997
I went to Harvard!
I'm a practicing Presbyterian!

04:57.338 --> 05:00.507
GPS calculating route.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.973
Turn left.

05:18.526 --> 05:22.112
I think you're right,
Nazatchov is a bit cross.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.991
It's your fault! You baited Nazatchov
with your questions!

05:25.992 --> 05:28.702
I was doing myjob as a
journalist!

05:33.583 --> 05:37.044
- GPS re-calculating route.
- I have a job too, missy!

05:37.045 --> 05:40.255
I manage a group
with 392,000 employees!

05:40.256 --> 05:43.050
Nazatchov exploits and traffics!

05:45.094 --> 05:47.637
Either we sign with Nazatchov
or we lay off...

05:53.144 --> 05:55.270
Keep to the left.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.984
Turn right in 600 feet.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.759
- Holy shit!
- Hang on tight.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.270
- Make U-turn in 300 feet.
- What are you doing?

06:39.607 --> 06:42.442
Make U-turn when possible.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.122
Yourjet is surrounded by
police.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.748
Forget the airport.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.159
Nazatchov will never let us
leave alive.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.828
He runs the entire country!

07:34.829 --> 07:39.249
- And that's alright with you?
- Shut up, would you!

07:41.043 --> 07:43.545
I know a mercenary, he'll save
us.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.882
Lazarevic.
An expert in crisis situations.

07:46.883 --> 07:50.427
Very costly but highly
efficient...

08:42.605 --> 08:45.065
You Bosnians are too
sentimental!

08:45.066 --> 08:48.693
Beware of clichés,
they sometimes end in massacres!

09:14.804 --> 09:19.307
LAKE GENEVA, SWITZERLAND

09:43.583 --> 09:45.625
- Hello.
- Good day, sir.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.169
- I'm here for Mr. Jung.
- He's waiting for you.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.507
Tell him to come in.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.510
Thank you for receiving me.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.763
At last I meet you.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.017
- Mr. Jung, it's time for your shot.
- Later.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.436
Later, I said.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.064
She's always on my back.

10:08.065 --> 10:11.026
You'd think she was in love!
Come here.

10:17.199 --> 10:22.495
Look at this.
This photo was taken here.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.206
Handsome, weren't we?

10:27.668 --> 10:30.420
You were my father's only
friend...

10:30.421 --> 10:34.049
His oldest, there's no doubt.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.427
This photo
dates back to October 1947.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.096
He was fresh from Yugoslavia
with his mother.

10:40.097 --> 10:43.600
They lived here, in the attic
rooms.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.020
Your grandmother worked
for my parents until she died.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.938
My grandmother?

10:48.939 --> 10:51.149
Nerio's mother.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.818
Your grandmother, Largo!

10:53.819 --> 10:58.907
I was one of the only people
who knew of your existence.

10:58.908 --> 11:03.953
Nerio often complained to me
about you running away.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.165
About your lack of gratitude
towards him...

11:07.166 --> 11:09.292
It's true,

11:09.293 --> 11:13.963
father and son relations
are complex.

11:16.092 --> 11:20.553
Nerio didn't want a son.
He wanted an heir.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.972
He left me no choice.

11:22.973 --> 11:27.018
But the fortune he left me...
I'll use it my way.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.229
I read your letter.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.065
Your project is fabulous.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.401
As former Red Cross President,

11:34.402 --> 11:38.488
I can only encourage you, but...
- But?

11:38.489 --> 11:44.744
The men who run this world
all have humanitarian foundations.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.038
That's nothing new.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.582
The rich give to the poor,

11:49.583 --> 11:52.460
but only a little.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.879
Very little.

11:54.880 --> 11:59.676
Putting your entire fortune
at the service of humanitarian causes

11:59.677 --> 12:03.054
will upset the established order.
- Good.

12:03.055 --> 12:08.643
And you will create many
enemies. Very many enemies.

12:08.644 --> 12:12.981
And very powerful ones.

12:14.942 --> 12:21.406
"A man with no enemies
is no man at all."

12:21.407 --> 12:24.033
Bosnian proverb.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.663
Don't make light of my words.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.667
Mr. Jung?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.508
The needle...
The needle!

12:57.777 --> 13:01.446
I'm happy to have met you.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.532
You'll be all right.

13:06.035 --> 13:09.496
My wife died of cancer ten years
ago.

13:09.497 --> 13:15.126
My only son died in an accident
when he'd just turned thirty.

13:15.127 --> 13:20.423
No one needs me anymore.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.594
I need you.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.840
The financial world has been
rocked!

14:43.841 --> 14:46.217
Nerio Winch's heir will...

14:46.218 --> 14:48.052
An ambitious project...

14:59.732 --> 15:01.774
You've given me a reason to
live.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.279
The captain informs us
that we've left territorial waters.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.031
Thank you, Gauthier.

15:08.032 --> 15:13.119
I'll open the champagne, sir!
For the occasion, I've chilled

15:13.120 --> 15:16.247
a bottle of Grand Siècle 1981 ,
which was given to your father

15:16.248 --> 15:20.627
by Mikhail Gorbachev at the opening
of the Minsk paper factory.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.046
Of course, in this overcast
weather,

15:23.047 --> 15:25.632
rosé champagne
might be more appropriate.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.594
I have a Laurent Perrier 2003...
- Gauthier! Anything you want.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.180
Very well, sir.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.141
Shall we?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.646
Have a seat.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.482
No regrets, Largo?

15:42.483 --> 15:45.151
This agreement is irrevocable.

15:45.152 --> 15:49.322
Your access to W Group accounts
will be frozen as soon as you sign.

15:49.323 --> 15:53.493
Prior to the final sale,
you'll be a poor man again.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.411
It's a classic contract.

15:55.412 --> 15:59.374
Kromberg Partners guarantees you
a buyer within two months.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.001
Moreover, the sales price is
indexed

16:02.002 --> 16:04.671
on your stock value,
on the day of the sale.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.382
If the sale took place today,

16:07.383 --> 16:12.178
that would come to
approximately 53 billion, Mr. Winch.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.347
That's all?

16:16.266 --> 16:20.520
Should your value rise,

16:20.521 --> 16:24.565
you could hope for a bit more...
- I jest, Mr. Beaumont.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.073
Please initial the pages and
sign.

16:32.074 --> 16:36.202
Why are we
signing the contract at sea?

16:36.203 --> 16:38.246
It allows us to sign the
agreement

16:38.247 --> 16:42.333
as if we were in the Swiss offices
of Kromberg Partners.

16:42.334 --> 16:46.087
With full Swiss tax advantages.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.089
And a signature...

17:40.934 --> 17:43.728
Deputy Prosecutor Francken
wishes to question you Mr. Winch.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.355
She could've called my office
for an appointment.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.901
Knowing her,
she's in your office right now.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.788
Open this door, Mr. Winch.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.707
It's Freddy Kaplan's cabin.
Only he has the key.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.877
- I told him.
- Must I break in?

20:54.878 --> 20:57.755
Do what you want, only do it
fast.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.427
Oh my God!

21:03.428 --> 21:05.429
Freddy!

21:08.392 --> 21:14.063
Death by strangulation.
It occurred at least 12 hours ago.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.776
No wonder you wouldn't
open the door.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.279
Are you accusing me
of murder as well?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.782
Calm down, Mr. Winch!

21:35.127 --> 21:38.254
I hated Freddy for many years.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.340
Whenever I ran away, he'd find
me.

21:41.341 --> 21:44.760
Every time.
- He was watching over you.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.013
He was spying on me.

21:49.391 --> 21:54.270
Freddy knew exactly
what I was doing in Burma.

21:54.271 --> 21:59.859
He knew I'd no contact with Nerio.
He'd have cleared my name.

21:59.860 --> 22:04.655
Do you think
that's why he was killed?

22:04.656 --> 22:07.700
Many very powerful enemies...

22:07.701 --> 22:10.494
You were so right.

22:10.495 --> 22:15.166
I only wish l could help you.

22:15.167 --> 22:19.754
Was Nerio capable of doing
something like that?

22:19.755 --> 22:21.964
That massacre?

22:21.965 --> 22:25.801
No. Of course not.

22:30.807 --> 22:35.019
He was my friend.
I want to believe he wasn't.

22:40.025 --> 22:45.071
MUONG NAM, BURMA
THREE YEARS EARLIER

23:30.826 --> 23:33.411
Malunaї?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.121
Kadjang!

23:44.673 --> 23:47.383
Largo is my friend.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.724
Come on,
I'll introduce you to my comrades.

23:59.020 --> 24:02.273
Ko Sin, Som Sak, this is
Malunaї.

25:15.680 --> 25:20.184
This is a Burmese Army pass
signed by General Kyaw Min.

25:55.428 --> 25:58.305
Stop it! Stop it!

26:01.643 --> 26:04.019
You stay out of this!

26:09.109 --> 26:13.696
You want to help him, do you?

30:50.515 --> 30:53.225
Did AAA send you?

30:53.226 --> 30:55.811
Let's just say "yes".

30:55.812 --> 30:58.230
They sure are on the ball.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.108
We have to get going.

31:04.153 --> 31:06.196
My name's Simon.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.198
Simon Ovronnaz.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.826
Largo.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.915
So one day,
I come home from work

31:16.916 --> 31:20.502
and Eleanor says: "I got a job
at the French School of Bangkok."

31:20.503 --> 31:23.797
For me,
Asia meant Chinese take-outjoints.

31:23.798 --> 31:27.175
But it didn't take me long,
I decided to come.

31:27.176 --> 31:30.470
She took the post
and I found a job too.

31:30.471 --> 31:33.307
'Cause, you know,
I'm totally lost without Eleanor!

31:33.308 --> 31:36.143
Shit, I can't see a thing.

31:36.144 --> 31:39.813
She might not be a babe,
but she's sweet.

31:39.814 --> 31:43.025
We've been together
since we were twelve years old.

31:43.026 --> 31:46.528
She's my mother's
best friend's daughter.

31:46.529 --> 31:49.072
We're supposed
to get married next year!

31:52.827 --> 31:55.203
Thailand.

31:59.959 --> 32:03.170
She's got everything all
planned...

32:07.759 --> 32:12.846
HONG KONG
THREE YEARS LATER

35:50.857 --> 35:53.650
Hello.
What is your password, please?

35:56.237 --> 35:58.530
Pandora.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.532
Thank you.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.493
What type of transaction
do you wish to make?

36:03.494 --> 36:07.122
I'd like to know my balance.

36:07.123 --> 36:10.125
One moment, please.

36:14.589 --> 36:20.135
The credit balance of your account
is 65,824,127 dollars.

36:48.247 --> 36:52.125
BANGKOK AIRPORT
THAILAND

36:52.126 --> 36:55.712
I'm not sure l'm the proper person
for your mission.

36:55.713 --> 37:00.217
I suffer horribly
from motion sickness.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.095
I must take these in order to
survive on your yacht, sir.

37:04.096 --> 37:08.683
Quinoa mixed with dried cassava
and bamboo shoots.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.685
It's miraculous.

37:10.686 --> 37:13.480
It acts upon the neuron-transmitters
that regulate nausea.

37:13.481 --> 37:17.067
A dear friend in Peru
whom l met

37:17.068 --> 37:20.820
when I was with the MacMullans
sends it to me...

37:28.829 --> 37:32.249
I just saw your pal Lazarevic
in Bangkok.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.627
I know he's efficient,
but l need no protection.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.629
You can call off your watchdog.

37:37.630 --> 37:40.924
It certainly is hot!
Humid too, no?

37:43.135 --> 37:45.136
Welcome to Bangkok.

37:45.137 --> 37:47.138
Customs informed us
of your arrival.

37:47.139 --> 37:50.100
I'm counting on you, Gauthier.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.978
Of course, sir.

41:36.577 --> 41:40.705
It's me again, sir.
I desperately need to speak to you

41:40.706 --> 41:43.666
so I've decided to leave
yet another message.

41:43.667 --> 41:47.295
As requested, I am looking
for a certain Simon Ovronnaz...

41:47.296 --> 41:50.089
I met his fiancée
- or rather ex-fiancée -

41:50.090 --> 41:52.550
who was not very cooperative.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.594
Apparently Mr. Ovronnaz
left her abruptly three years ago.

41:54.595 --> 41:57.555
She still holds a grudge.

41:57.556 --> 41:59.974
But rest assured,

41:59.975 --> 42:03.937
I pursued my investigation
by questioning the caretaker.

42:03.938 --> 42:07.232
The man - who incidentally
had appalling bad breath -

42:07.233 --> 42:11.361
indicated the address
of Mr. Orvonnaz's new lady friend...

42:11.362 --> 42:13.404
Well, his ex-lady friend now.

42:13.405 --> 42:15.615
Charming by the way.

42:15.616 --> 42:18.826
From what I gather,
Mr. Ovronnaz has moved south,

42:18.827 --> 42:21.204
to Ko Sukon,
to live with another friend...

42:21.205 --> 42:23.665
If you see what I mean.

42:23.666 --> 42:26.751
Since l've had no news from you,
sir, l shall travel...

42:26.752 --> 42:29.212
Darn!

42:29.213 --> 42:31.464
It cut off.

43:01.829 --> 43:07.208
I'd hoped Lazarevic would organize
a commando operation to free me.

43:07.209 --> 43:09.627
I got your message.

43:09.628 --> 43:12.797
I've had no contact with
Lazarevic

43:12.798 --> 43:14.799
since the Nazatchov episode.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.759
He flew into Bangkok
on a Winch Airjet.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.887
As it happens, half his fees
- which were quite steep -

43:19.888 --> 43:22.307
were paid in Winch Air flight
time.

43:22.308 --> 43:25.643
He goes where he wants,
when he wants.

43:25.644 --> 43:27.604
He's a mercenary
who works for the highest bidder.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.522
As for you, Largo,

43:29.523 --> 43:32.108
the Thai Justice Minister
arranged everything.

43:32.109 --> 43:34.694
I had nothing to do with it.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.030
Someone informed him
that you were in jail...

43:43.537 --> 43:48.458
The Thai government
wants no trouble with the W Group.

43:48.459 --> 43:51.294
Did he convince Francken
of my innocence?

43:51.295 --> 43:55.381
- Francken has no proof.
- She has a witness.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.550
She had a witness.

43:57.551 --> 44:02.096
I told you, the Thai authorities
arranged everything.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.912
Let's go!

45:09.707 --> 45:14.585
MAKILING MILITARY CAMP
BURMA

45:18.382 --> 45:20.925
Drive through!

45:27.850 --> 45:31.644
Move it!

45:59.882 --> 46:02.759
- Hello, Mr. Cochrane.
- Hello.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.887
Mr. Winch isn't here?

46:05.888 --> 46:08.347
What powers of observation!

46:08.348 --> 46:12.143
I hear he might have...

46:12.144 --> 46:14.479
disappeared?

46:14.480 --> 46:17.356
Mr. Winch
signed a contract with you.

46:17.357 --> 46:19.859
Just find us a buyer.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.528
I told you,
we have a serious offer.

46:22.529 --> 46:24.530
Perfect. Where is it?

46:24.531 --> 46:26.783
Follow me, Mr. Cochrane.

48:14.933 --> 48:19.562
UNITED NATlONS GENEVA,
SWlTZERLAND

48:26.778 --> 48:28.988
Vladimir Podolsky,
Private Secretary.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.073
- Did you have a good trip?
- Thank you.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.159
- This is my assistant.
- Hello.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.995
Sorry we're late. Is he here?

48:35.996 --> 48:39.498
The Swiss are punctual,
so imagine Swiss judges...

48:41.919 --> 48:45.421
Do you know what the expression
"bank secrecy" means, madam?

49:21.667 --> 49:23.668
Leave us alone.

49:44.439 --> 49:47.358
Put this on.

49:47.359 --> 49:50.403
I want to dine with a real
woman.

49:50.404 --> 49:54.448
And there aren't many
in this rat hole.

49:54.449 --> 49:57.827
Put it on!

50:11.466 --> 50:15.344
You did a good job.

50:18.515 --> 50:22.518
Winch went to great lengths
to find you.

50:22.519 --> 50:26.605
He contacted me.

50:54.468 --> 50:59.388
Magnificent.

50:59.389 --> 51:01.932
Really magnificent.

51:06.855 --> 51:09.482
Sit down.

51:15.155 --> 51:17.990
With the money
Winch will pay me to free you,

51:17.991 --> 51:20.242
I'm going to leave this jungle.

51:20.243 --> 51:22.828
And this shitty country.

51:26.249 --> 51:28.584
I'm going to become a new man.

51:31.088 --> 51:34.757
I'm going to start a new life.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.929
You could come with me.

51:39.930 --> 51:42.056
I'll take good care of you.

51:44.059 --> 51:49.146
I'll treat you like a princess.

51:53.568 --> 51:58.739
Have you forgotten?
You can't say no to me!

51:58.740 --> 52:01.659
Have you forgotten already?

52:09.668 --> 52:13.462
Send a jeep for Winch tomorrow.

52:13.463 --> 52:17.091
As soon as he transfers the money,
we kill them.

52:17.092 --> 52:20.636
Both of them.

52:22.931 --> 52:25.141
It's me again, sir.

52:25.142 --> 52:27.518
I am still discreetly searching

52:27.519 --> 52:29.854
for Simon Ovronnaz
but despite my efforts

52:29.855 --> 52:32.314
I'm unable to locate him.

52:32.315 --> 52:36.485
The mission you gave me
is difficult indeed.

52:36.486 --> 52:38.320
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

52:38.321 --> 52:41.532
Scoffing every conceivable danger,
I have pursued my quest,

52:41.533 --> 52:44.702
traveling to the innermost
regions of Thailand,

52:44.703 --> 52:47.913
which one could call
picturesque.

52:47.914 --> 52:50.332
My experience as a Scout
has helped me survive

52:50.333 --> 52:52.793
in this foreign-though-not-hostile
land and mix with the locals,

52:55.213 --> 52:58.257
who sometimes
even prove to be warm.

52:58.258 --> 53:01.760
As for Simon Ovronnaz,
he's no longer in Ko Sukon.

53:01.761 --> 53:03.888
Financial difficulties,

53:03.889 --> 53:06.932
if l correctly understood
his recent ex-lady friend.

53:06.933 --> 53:09.435
Thank goodness,
I have a new trail...

53:09.436 --> 53:12.354
in Bangkok.

53:12.355 --> 53:15.524
That's all, sir, l hope you're well.
I worry about you.

53:15.525 --> 53:17.526
Where are you?

53:17.527 --> 53:19.403
Call me as soon as...

53:19.404 --> 53:21.488
Darn!

53:21.489 --> 53:24.950
It cut off.

55:19.357 --> 55:21.358
The general is expecting us.

55:21.359 --> 55:23.402
He wants to see this man.

55:23.403 --> 55:26.030
I've received the orders.

55:30.744 --> 55:33.412
Get moving!

57:11.678 --> 57:15.180
Want us to go up in flames?

57:15.181 --> 57:17.391
What's going on here?

57:18.810 --> 57:22.354
Who are they?

57:22.355 --> 57:25.482
What are you doing here?

57:25.483 --> 57:29.445
I've got a prisoner for you.

57:29.446 --> 57:32.072
What's this bullshit? Answer me!

57:32.073 --> 57:34.658
Where'd you come from?

58:24.626 --> 58:26.627
Run for the jungle!
In small groups!

58:26.628 --> 58:29.546
Come on! Hurry up!

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:46.099
Hello. Your password, please?

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:50.687
Pandora.

01:00:50.688 --> 01:00:54.650
Hurry up!

01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:07.120
Come on!

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:14.086
Yes, I confirm the transfer.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.848
Don't move!

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:33.689
Don't be afraid. Mommy is here.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.067
Mommy will come and get you.
Don't be afraid.

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.775
We're leaving now!

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:21.653
Hold on tight.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:06.174
How old are you?

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.218
Two and a half.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.518
What's your name?

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:05.942
Noom!

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:08.778
Come here.

01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:11.781
Come on, come here.

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.880
Let's see how you steer a boat.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.080
You are indeed Simon Ovronnaz?

01:09:11.438 --> 01:09:14.023
I was tied up to a rope!

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:17.318
Upside-down!

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.487
I was this close to dying.

01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:24.658
Believe me, it changes a guy.

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:28.621
When I got back to Bangkok,
my life with Eleanor was over.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:31.291
I wanted to live!

01:09:34.752 --> 01:09:37.589
Your boss saved my life!

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.883
I think l've understood.

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:42.635
You've told me
eleven times to be exact.

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:44.845
Eleven times!

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:49.058
I'm so fucking indebted to him!

01:09:49.059 --> 01:09:51.644
Hello? Sir?

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.897
It's you!

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:57.442
I'm with Simon Ovronnaz.
I found him, sir!

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.903
I found him!

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:01.905
Is it him?

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:03.907
Hold on, sir!

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.993
You've waited three years,
you can wait another three minutes.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:11.122
Yes, sir, everything's fine.

01:10:11.123 --> 01:10:13.708
And you, where are you?

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.960
Not next door, Gauthier.

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:18.922
You'll have to travel a ways.

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:41.481
Do you confirm
the transfer of 25 million dollars

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:45.234
from your Pandora account,
to account No. 634 TX 49?

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:50.865
Yes, I confirm the transfer.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:29.070
- My savior!
- AAA at your service.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.656
You know he saved my life?

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.700
I need to understand Nerio Winch's
relation with Kyaw Min.

01:13:36.703 --> 01:13:41.249
How can I find the guy
you drove around? He should know.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.876
That won't be easy.

01:13:43.877 --> 01:13:46.129
He's dead.

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:54.220
But I might be able to help you.

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:58.391
I think l know why your father
didn't pay the general...

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:01.060
The guy hired me for a week.
THREE YEARS EARLIER

01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:04.355
He had to go to Burma.

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:07.942
A business trip, he said.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:11.028
We stayed in a military camp there
for a few days.

01:14:11.029 --> 01:14:13.948
He hung out a lot
with the army general.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:16.033
He said nothing to me,

01:14:16.034 --> 01:14:17.994
but l knew something was up.

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:21.747
Then one day,
the soldiers left on a mission.

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:23.958
They returned
with dozens of prisoners.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:27.420
Women, children, wounded
persons...

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:30.381
The soldiers had burned down
their village.

01:14:30.382 --> 01:14:32.133
Totally destroyed it.

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:34.677
Apparently that was their plan.

01:14:34.678 --> 01:14:37.597
But then things went wrong...

01:14:57.451 --> 01:15:00.286
Mr. Winch,
if you don't transfer the money...

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:03.831
Yes, I know!

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:06.292
Think how big
those mines will pay off.

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:10.046
I couldn't!

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:12.507
I figured your dad
had greased a few palms

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.592
to get the mining concession.

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:17.303
But what he didn't know,

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:21.057
was that civilians
would be massacred in exchange.

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:23.559
Hello. It's me.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.063
I talked to Nerio Winch.
He refuses to pay.

01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:31.817
You've got to talk to him.

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:35.071
Go see him.

01:15:41.286 --> 01:15:46.165
Then he said we had to escape.
Fast.

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:56.092
I was free to move about,

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:59.011
so I left the camp to wait for
him.

01:16:01.014 --> 01:16:03.599
Let go of me, shit!

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.185
Let go of me!

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:35.590
An hour later, l hit the road.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:39.468
I picked up some wounded.
You know the rest.

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.932
Your father wasn't responsible
for the massacre.

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:49.687
What was the guy's name?

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.692
Thomas. Yeah, Thomas.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:57.111
You don't remember his last
name?

01:16:57.112 --> 01:17:00.865
I never knew it.

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:04.327
Why would l have?

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:31.242
Gauthier?
Meet me downstairs.

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:14.822
Mommy!

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:28.687
Mommy, where are you?

01:24:42.368 --> 01:24:45.788
Where are you, Mommy?

01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:59.343
Come on, let's get dressed.

01:25:07.143 --> 01:25:11.063
I want Mommy to dress me.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:16.068
We have to leave.

01:25:16.069 --> 01:25:20.405
Mommy?

01:25:20.406 --> 01:25:22.908
Mommy had to go.

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:24.845
You've never seen a kid?

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.722
Let's go.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:45.152
Where's Mommy?

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:50.282
Mommy isn't coming back, Noom.

01:28:50.283 --> 01:28:54.953
Mommy is dead.

01:28:57.415 --> 01:29:00.876
She's gone forever.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:14.348
But she's watching over you.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:18.352
And she'll always love you.

01:29:51.844 --> 01:29:55.013
What'll you do now?

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:03.480
You can't let that scoundrel
Nazatchov win.

01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:05.732
That swine!

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:08.193
That son-of-a...

01:30:08.194 --> 01:30:10.987
- I beg your pardon.
- I don't care about Nazatchov.

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:17.619
Hang on, isn't it his fault
the kid's mother died?

01:30:25.628 --> 01:30:28.338
You can't leave your group
in his hands.

01:30:28.339 --> 01:30:31.675
Think of what he'd
do with such power.

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:33.718
You have a responsibility.

01:30:33.719 --> 01:30:35.762
He won, Gauthier.

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:39.141
I signed a sales agreement, he paid.
There's no turning back.

01:30:39.142 --> 01:30:43.061
Do you know the legend of
Pandora?

01:30:43.062 --> 01:30:46.773
Zeus gave Epimetheus a gift:
Pandora, the first woman on Earth.

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:50.652
She possessed a box,
which Zeus forbade her to open,

01:30:50.653 --> 01:30:53.488
but one day,
her curiosity got the best of her.

01:30:53.489 --> 01:30:55.657
And she opened the lid.

01:30:55.658 --> 01:30:59.578
The evils of humanity
escaped and flooded the Earth:

01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:02.372
old age, disease,
deceit and insanity...

01:31:02.373 --> 01:31:06.084
Terrified,
Pandora quickly shut the box.

01:31:06.085 --> 01:31:08.712
Fortunately...

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:11.173
for it was not entirely empty.

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:14.468
One precious little thing
remained at the bottom of the box:

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:17.262
Hope.

01:31:17.263 --> 01:31:19.973
And from that day onward,

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:22.726
though Man might be stricken
by great misfortune,

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:26.313
deep inside, there always remains
a glimmer of hope.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.315
You cannot lose hope, sir.

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:31.401
Not as long as you're alive.

01:31:31.402 --> 01:31:34.779
- What is your password?
- Pandora.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:38.158
I would like
to make a 7-dollar transfer.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.160
Seven dollars? Four plus three?

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.162
That's correct.

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.998
What is the destination account?

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:13.944
I'm leaving for Geneva,
I'll be there for the sale.

01:33:00.283 --> 01:33:03.118
So what exactly is your plan?

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:14.504
You have the sign?

01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:06.431
What do you mean you
"didn't finish pilot training"?

01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:10.518
My teacher died suddenly.

01:34:10.519 --> 01:34:14.105
An accident?

01:34:14.106 --> 01:34:16.441
Murder.

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:20.779
Strangled by that guy there.

01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:43.885
Anything I can do?

01:34:43.886 --> 01:34:45.929
Yes.

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:48.431
Stop fidgeting.

01:35:02.446 --> 01:35:04.489
You have to eat.

01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:06.658
You're not hungry?

01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:32.016
Shit, they're scary
even when they're asleep.

01:35:38.357 --> 01:35:42.026
Shit, you scare me too.

01:36:39.376 --> 01:36:44.380
Geneva tower,
Winch Air Quebec Zulu.

01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:46.508
Radar guidance on Runway 3G.

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:49.677
We're beginning our descent.

01:36:49.678 --> 01:36:54.140
If you only knew
how happy this makes me.

01:37:11.909 --> 01:37:15.495
I'll kill you, you
son-of-a-bitch!

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:18.081
Take over the controls.

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.445
Hang on tight!

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:17.427
You alright?

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:20.013
No problem.

01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:41.325
Where are you?

01:40:43.746 --> 01:40:45.788
Yes, of course.

01:40:45.789 --> 01:40:47.999
I'll send my driver.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.877
Where exactly are you?

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:59.177
Hello. Passports, please.

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:04.432
You always travel armed like
this?

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.752
The nurse will be right down.

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.754
Alexandre Jung. Welcome.

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:36.839
Simon Ovronnaz.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.009
- Mr. Winch refused to come with us.
- He wanted to see the prosecutor.

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:42.678
And you let him?

01:41:42.679 --> 01:41:44.847
That's insane!

01:41:44.848 --> 01:41:48.392
You don't realize,
the woman is dangerous.

01:43:07.306 --> 01:43:11.309
Get in!

01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:15.146
I was worried.

01:43:15.147 --> 01:43:17.690
No need.
I'll explain everything to Francken.

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:25.573
Nazatchov is a fool. How could he
mastermind such a scheme?

01:43:25.574 --> 01:43:28.159
Even fools have strokes of
genius.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.578
Perhaps.

01:43:30.579 --> 01:43:33.623
But how did he know
what happened in Burma

01:43:33.624 --> 01:43:35.791
three years ago?

01:43:35.792 --> 01:43:38.794
He had an informer,
someone inside the group.

01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:44.383
I'll come with you.

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:47.470
You're an angel.
My leg barely hurts anymore.

01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:51.098
One last drop?

01:43:51.099 --> 01:43:54.435
Thanks.

01:43:56.313 --> 01:44:00.524
What if Nazatchov were simply
the financier of the operation?

01:44:00.525 --> 01:44:04.362
What if someone else
were hiding behind him?

01:44:08.283 --> 01:44:11.744
To dream up a plot like that,

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:16.457
you need motivation
that goes beyond the lure of gain.

01:44:16.458 --> 01:44:20.127
You need a raging desire
to humiliate,

01:44:20.128 --> 01:44:22.672
to utterly destroy
and bring down a reputation,

01:44:22.673 --> 01:44:25.758
a name,

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:35.268
Money alone
cannot be the driving force.

01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:38.980
This was...

01:44:38.981 --> 01:44:42.066
vengeance.

01:44:42.067 --> 01:44:45.361
Hatred.

01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:52.326
My son was a lobbyist for Nerio.

01:44:52.327 --> 01:44:54.620
Thomas...

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:56.956
Thomas Jung.

01:45:13.181 --> 01:45:16.684
He used my personal contacts

01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:20.563
to help the W Group
win new markets

01:45:20.564 --> 01:45:22.732
and concessions.

01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:25.860
Nerio never balked at paying
bribes.

01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:28.988
That's what "Pandora" was for.

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:32.700
Each time he won a contract,

01:45:32.701 --> 01:45:36.746
Nerio paid my son Thomas
a commission.

01:45:36.747 --> 01:45:41.083
But all that money went to his
head.

01:45:41.084 --> 01:45:43.085
He wanted more and more.

01:45:43.086 --> 01:45:46.630
When I saw you for the first
time,

01:45:46.631 --> 01:45:49.675
so young, so handsome and rich,

01:45:49.676 --> 01:45:52.345
so completely alive...

01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:55.723
I was approaching death,

01:45:55.724 --> 01:45:59.894
but you gave me a reason to
live...

01:46:01.938 --> 01:46:05.358
Vengeance!

01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:09.820
Nazatchov is an idiot.

01:46:09.821 --> 01:46:13.991
He merely obeys and pays.

01:46:13.992 --> 01:46:16.160
Tonight,

01:46:16.161 --> 01:46:18.954
you shall kill Prosecutor
Francken.

01:46:18.955 --> 01:46:21.540
The only person
who can prove your innocence.

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:23.751
Give him another shot.

01:46:23.752 --> 01:46:26.837
There are more vials in the car.

01:46:29.674 --> 01:46:32.718
Do what I tell you!

01:47:07.462 --> 01:47:10.047
Sugar...

01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:15.010
Here.

01:47:28.733 --> 01:47:31.861
Call the police, fast!

01:48:22.787 --> 01:48:25.039
Alexandre!

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.917
Don't do it!
- I did the same!

01:48:27.918 --> 01:48:30.252
I begged Nerio to save my son.

01:48:30.253 --> 01:48:32.087
All he had to do was pay.

01:48:32.088 --> 01:48:35.674
I swear to you, Largo,
I begged him on my knees.

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:39.470
My oldest friend! My brother!

01:48:39.471 --> 01:48:43.140
On my knees!

01:48:43.141 --> 01:48:46.936
Stop! Don't come any closer!

01:48:49.397 --> 01:48:51.649
Your son had become a piece of
shit

01:48:51.650 --> 01:48:53.734
and you know it.

01:48:53.735 --> 01:48:55.736
He ordered the massacre in
Burma.

01:48:55.737 --> 01:48:58.656
He was my child!

01:50:50.935 --> 01:50:53.771
Are the chicks pretty in Hong
Kong?

01:50:53.772 --> 01:50:56.148
I beg your pardon?

01:50:58.234 --> 01:51:00.235
The girls...

01:51:00.236 --> 01:51:03.405
Hong Kong...

01:51:03.406 --> 01:51:06.992
Largo invited me
to spend some time there.

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:09.078
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:51:09.079 --> 01:51:11.413
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

01:51:11.414 --> 01:51:13.916
Want some Phat Thai?

01:51:16.628 --> 01:51:19.254
You and I are gonna make
a great team.

01:51:21.633 --> 01:51:25.260
What do you say, pal?
- I'm not your pal!

01:51:25.261 --> 01:51:28.222
You will be soon.

01:51:36.564 --> 01:51:39.191
Ready to go?

01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:41.568
No.

01:51:44.322 --> 01:51:46.865
We'll come back whenever you
like.

01:51:50.286 --> 01:51:53.497
I live on a big boat, you know.

01:51:53.498 --> 01:51:55.874
No, I don't know.

01:51:55.875 --> 01:51:59.962
It's surrounded by tall houses
that touch the sky.

01:51:59.963 --> 01:52:04.299
And my office is at the very top
of the tallest house.

01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:08.137
Are you all alone up there?

01:52:08.138 --> 01:52:11.765
Not anymore.
