The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.896 --> 00:04.830
Well, there was this girl.

00:05.198 --> 00:07.132
What did you do?

00:07.200 --> 00:08.132
Nothing.

00:08.201 --> 00:11.102
Really, it was just kissing.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.940
All right.

00:16.008 --> 00:18.243
So, we're still
getting married?

00:20.112 --> 00:21.279
Yes.

00:22.581 --> 00:24.549
Because we love each other.

00:24.616 --> 00:26.217
Yes.

00:26.285 --> 00:29.654
And it's the happiest day
of our life.

00:29.722 --> 00:31.022
Don't push it.

00:33.759 --> 00:35.927
I need some time
to take a step back

00:35.995 --> 00:39.164
and reevaluate our situation.

00:40.199 --> 00:41.800
Oh.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.902
Bye, Sheldon.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.339
Well, Gollum...

00:50.475 --> 00:53.677
...you're an expert on rings.

00:53.745 --> 00:56.046
What do I do with this one?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.251
So, what package
are you thinking?

01:01.319 --> 01:03.253
Mm, this one comes with
music and flowers.

01:03.321 --> 01:06.690
Oh, they even stream the whole
thing live on the Internet.

01:06.758 --> 01:08.125
Why would we want that?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.527
'Cause there's a lot
of gorgeous blondes out there

01:10.595 --> 01:13.296
who don't believe they can land
a short, nearsighted scientist.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.832
Let's give them hope.

01:15.899 --> 01:17.466
Whatever. Put us
on the Internet.

01:17.534 --> 01:20.369
I've always wanted a wedding
with a comment section.

01:20.437 --> 01:24.673
I-If you're not into this,
we can do it another time.

01:24.742 --> 01:26.042
No. No, I want to.

01:26.110 --> 01:28.211
Look, we've put this
off long enough.

01:28.278 --> 01:29.712
Let's do it.
Aw.

01:29.780 --> 01:32.915
That's exactly what you said the
first time we slept together.

01:34.484 --> 01:36.318
Oh, excuse me.

01:36.386 --> 01:37.553
Sheldon.

01:37.621 --> 01:38.754
Hey.

01:38.821 --> 01:40.688
Leonard, have you
gotten married yet?

01:40.757 --> 01:41.857
No. Why?

01:41.924 --> 01:43.591
Good. Don't do it!
Why not?

01:43.659 --> 01:45.927
Some important new information
has come to light.

01:45.995 --> 01:48.930
Women are the worst.

01:48.998 --> 01:50.832
I thought it was paper cuts,
but I was wrong.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.701
No piece of paper
ever cut me this deep.

01:53.770 --> 01:55.470
What happened now?

01:55.537 --> 01:58.907
Amy has ended our relationship.

01:58.975 --> 02:00.242
Oh, no. Seriously?

02:00.309 --> 02:01.009
What's going on?

02:01.077 --> 02:02.510
Amy broke up with Sheldon.

02:02.578 --> 02:03.744
She did?

02:03.812 --> 02:06.213
Is Penny crying?

02:06.281 --> 02:07.281
No.

02:07.315 --> 02:08.082
No, of course not.

02:08.150 --> 02:10.751
They thrive on our suffering.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.552
Buddy, I-I'm so sorry.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.554
Is there anything I can do?

02:14.622 --> 02:15.990
Yes. If I ever talk about

02:16.057 --> 02:18.259
going out with a girl again,
roll your eyes at me

02:18.326 --> 02:21.395
like I do to you
when you say dumb things.

02:21.462 --> 02:22.897
Sheldon, uh, o-okay,
just because

02:22.964 --> 02:24.364
you're going through this
with Amy

02:24.432 --> 02:26.400
doesn't mean
that all women are bad.

02:26.467 --> 02:28.769
Whatever.

02:28.836 --> 02:30.136
Hey, I just heard

02:30.204 --> 02:31.772
about you and Sheldon.
Are you okay?

02:31.839 --> 02:32.939
Not really.

02:33.007 --> 02:34.441
Can you come over?

02:34.509 --> 02:36.042
Uh, actually I'm in Vegas.

02:36.110 --> 02:38.244
Leonard and I
are about to get married.

02:38.313 --> 02:39.546
Hold on.

02:39.614 --> 02:42.015
You're getting married
and you didn't invite me?

02:42.082 --> 02:44.651
Well, it was kind of
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

02:44.719 --> 02:46.052
Wow.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.856
Hope I can catch
the bouquet from here.

02:49.924 --> 02:51.725
Amy, don't be like that.

02:51.793 --> 02:53.727
Why did I just hear Amy's name?

02:53.795 --> 02:54.894
Penny's on the phone
with her.

02:54.962 --> 02:56.095
Did she say anything about me?

02:56.163 --> 02:57.630
Never mind. I don't care.

02:57.698 --> 02:59.498
Well, if you care,
you can find out and tell me.

02:59.566 --> 03:02.635
Just don't be shocked when
you find out that I don't care.

03:02.703 --> 03:03.769
Okay, will you relax?

03:03.838 --> 03:05.939
You're not missing
anything special.

03:06.807 --> 03:08.574
Hey.

03:08.642 --> 03:09.642
She's upset.

03:09.676 --> 03:11.077
Look, it's gonna be
a great wedding.

03:11.145 --> 03:13.947
Look at you in
your little suit.

03:14.014 --> 03:15.715
Amy's upset? Is it about me?

03:15.782 --> 03:17.250
No, I think it's because
we're eloping.

03:17.318 --> 03:19.552
Your marriage
is causing her pain?

03:19.619 --> 03:20.853
Yeah, great, I take it back.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.356
Go ahead and do it.
Yay for love!

03:53.913 --> 03:56.215
Hello.
Oh!

03:56.820 --> 03:58.287
What are you doing here?

03:58.355 --> 04:01.657
When last we spoke,
you said you needed time.

04:01.725 --> 04:05.093
Well, it's only been 11 hours.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.730
<i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy
was nearly 11 hours.

04:07.797 --> 04:10.266
I made you watch that,
you said it was an eternity.

04:10.333 --> 04:14.536
Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk,
I'll let you know.

04:14.604 --> 04:16.004
Very well.

04:16.072 --> 04:17.839
You seem to be
headed somewhere.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.575
May I walk with you?

04:19.642 --> 04:21.644
Sure.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.148
Boy, I'm glad we're
going out again.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.385
We're not back together.

04:29.452 --> 04:30.452
Why?

04:30.487 --> 04:31.620
Is there someone else?

04:31.688 --> 04:32.988
Just couldn't wait
for that first notch

04:33.055 --> 04:34.689
on your bedpost, could you?

04:34.757 --> 04:36.691
If you must know,

04:36.759 --> 04:38.193
I'm going to Howard
and Bernadette's

04:38.261 --> 04:39.627
to watch the wedding.

04:39.695 --> 04:40.728
And who's this guy
you're taking?

04:40.797 --> 04:41.830
There's no guy!

04:41.898 --> 04:43.331
Oh, you're going
to a wedding alone?

04:43.399 --> 04:45.100
That's sad.

04:45.168 --> 04:46.334
I'm not gonna be alone.

04:46.402 --> 04:47.669
I'll be with my friends.

04:47.736 --> 04:48.870
<i>Your</i> friends?

04:48.938 --> 04:50.471
Well, I think you mean
<i>my</i> friends.

04:50.539 --> 04:52.207
And why wasn't
I invited to this?

04:52.275 --> 04:54.342
Maybe because the two of us
being there

04:54.410 --> 04:56.611
would make them feel awkward.

04:56.679 --> 04:58.513
We make everyone
feel awkward.

04:58.580 --> 05:00.849
That's our thing!

05:01.984 --> 05:03.351
They're running
a little behind.

05:03.419 --> 05:04.952
Should be pretty soon.
Okay.

05:05.020 --> 05:07.622
Hey, if you're hungry,
there's a breakfast buffet

05:07.690 --> 05:09.824
at the strip club next door.

05:09.891 --> 05:14.128
Thanks, but I don't like glitter
on my scrambled eggs.

05:14.196 --> 05:18.199
I don't think the strippers
prepare the meal, but okay.

05:19.601 --> 05:22.837
Look, it-it's not
how I pictured it either,

05:22.904 --> 05:24.472
but I'm still glad
we're doing it.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.374
Me, too.
You sure?

05:26.442 --> 05:27.842
Yes.
And you promise

05:27.909 --> 05:29.844
you're okay with
everything from the car?

05:29.911 --> 05:31.611
Oh, my God, would you stop
bringing it up?

05:31.679 --> 05:33.513
You're right.
I'm sorry.

05:33.581 --> 05:35.015
We have the rest of our lives

05:35.083 --> 05:38.319
to dredge stuff up from the past
and fight about it.

05:39.587 --> 05:40.687
So what do you think?

05:40.755 --> 05:42.589
Should we run next door
and grab a bite?

05:42.657 --> 05:44.124
What if they call our names?

05:44.192 --> 05:47.694
Oh, don't worry. They gave me
this vibrating coaster.

05:47.762 --> 05:51.130
Oh, and the fairy tale
continues.

05:53.601 --> 05:55.569
Thank you for doing this.

05:55.636 --> 05:56.737
Our pleasure.

05:56.804 --> 05:58.004
You feeling okay?

05:58.072 --> 06:00.073
We were together for so long,

06:00.140 --> 06:02.509
I honestly don't know
what I'm feeling.

06:02.577 --> 06:04.644
Well, that's
understandable.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.180
You forgot.
It's called "happy."

06:07.248 --> 06:08.615
Howard.

06:08.683 --> 06:09.716
I'm not saying
anything bad.

06:09.784 --> 06:11.885
Just that she was in love
with her captor

06:11.952 --> 06:15.221
and somehow managed to escape
from his dark and crazy dungeon.

06:16.891 --> 06:18.057
I know
what you're going through.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.526
My-my last breakup
was pretty tough.

06:20.594 --> 06:22.795
Oh. What was her name?

06:22.863 --> 06:23.963
Hey, it's a true story.

06:24.031 --> 06:26.065
I don't need the third degree.

06:31.038 --> 06:33.839
For God's sake, Sheldon,
what are you doing?

06:33.908 --> 06:35.440
I didn't want
to come in.

06:35.508 --> 06:38.610
I was told it would make
everyone feel uncomfortable.

06:39.379 --> 06:40.578
So I'll just stay out here

06:40.646 --> 06:42.948
and pretend that I don't
have to go to the bathroom.

06:46.152 --> 06:47.886
Howard, do something.

06:47.954 --> 06:49.988
I'm on it.

06:56.963 --> 07:00.631
Sheldon, you being here might
not be making things better.

07:00.698 --> 07:02.599
I see.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.202
And is that why
everybody was invited but me?

07:05.270 --> 07:07.204
They didn't invite
everybody but you.

07:07.272 --> 07:08.772
Bernadette invited me,

07:08.840 --> 07:10.074
and Stuart lives here.

07:10.142 --> 07:12.843
Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?

07:15.747 --> 07:18.649
So, when you hear the music,
that's your cue.

07:18.716 --> 07:19.951
Any questions?

07:20.018 --> 07:21.919
Oh, the package
that we paid for

07:21.986 --> 07:24.520
said the aisle was supposed
to be strewn with rose petals.

07:24.588 --> 07:25.888
Where are the rose petals?!

07:25.957 --> 07:27.991
We're out!
You know what?

07:28.059 --> 07:29.259
It's fine.

07:29.327 --> 07:31.727
We can use the
potpourri from the bathroom!

07:31.795 --> 07:33.430
Really, we're good.

07:33.497 --> 07:35.065
Yup, just want
to get married.

07:35.132 --> 07:36.266
Yeah.
Great.

07:36.334 --> 07:38.301
I'll see you two
up there.

07:40.804 --> 07:43.306
This is it.
I know.

07:43.374 --> 07:46.108
I love you.

07:46.176 --> 07:48.077
I love you, too.

07:48.144 --> 07:50.580
Was that a yes
or no on the potpourri?!

07:50.647 --> 07:52.715
No, thank you!
We're good!

07:55.853 --> 07:57.386
Raj, you're probably wondering

07:57.454 --> 08:00.957
why Amy and I aren't showing
any affection to one another.

08:01.024 --> 08:03.192
Didn't even crack the top ten.

08:05.261 --> 08:06.295
Well, you should know

08:06.363 --> 08:07.930
that she recently
broke up with me.

08:07.998 --> 08:10.799
I said I needed
time to think.

08:10.867 --> 08:13.135
I'm sure you guys
will figure something out.

08:13.203 --> 08:15.904
You hear that?
Raj is devastated.

08:15.972 --> 08:18.673
Sheldon, shh.
The wedding's starting.

08:18.741 --> 08:20.309
I see what's happening.

08:20.377 --> 08:21.643
Sides are forming.

08:21.711 --> 08:23.812
Well, if Bernadette's
on Amy's team, I pick Howard.

08:23.880 --> 08:24.913
I'm not taking sides.

08:24.981 --> 08:26.382
Fine, I guess
I'm stuck with Raj.

08:26.449 --> 08:27.716
Really?

08:27.783 --> 08:30.519
At least you
got picked.

08:32.255 --> 08:33.322
Before I go any further,

08:33.390 --> 08:35.289
have either of you
prepared your own vows?

08:35.357 --> 08:36.789
Yes.
No.

08:37.493 --> 08:39.527
You wrote vows?

08:39.594 --> 08:40.594
Yeah.

08:40.629 --> 08:42.330
Well, I don't have any.

08:42.398 --> 08:45.066
You're kind of
making me look bad.

08:45.134 --> 08:47.601
It's okay. I-I don't
have to say them.

08:47.669 --> 08:48.969
No, no, no, go ahead.

08:49.038 --> 08:52.940
I'll come up with something
mushy, you'll cry, we got this.

08:53.008 --> 08:55.743
"Penny, we are
made of particles

08:55.810 --> 08:58.111
"that have existed since the
moment the universe began.

08:58.179 --> 09:00.947
"I like to think
those atoms traveled

09:01.015 --> 09:04.017
"14 billion years through
time and space to create us,

09:04.085 --> 09:08.021
so that we could be together
and make each other whole."

09:08.089 --> 09:10.524
Wow.

09:11.526 --> 09:13.260
Penny?

09:13.327 --> 09:17.030
Right. Um... okay.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.936
Leonard, I mean, you're not
only the love of my life.

09:23.003 --> 09:25.204
I mean,
you're my best friend, and...

09:27.307 --> 09:30.242
...you've got a friend in me.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.948
You got troubles.

09:35.015 --> 09:36.816
I got 'em, too.

09:38.251 --> 09:41.988
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you.

09:42.056 --> 09:45.558
We stick together,
and we can see it through,

09:45.625 --> 09:48.927
'cause... you've got
a friend in me.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.731
Is that the song
from <i>Toy Story?</i>

09:52.799 --> 09:53.799
He loves that movie.

09:53.866 --> 09:55.301
I do.

09:57.571 --> 10:00.272
Aw, that was beautiful.
Yeah.

10:00.340 --> 10:02.208
I mean, not like our
wedding beautiful.

10:02.275 --> 10:04.910
No, we totally won.

10:04.978 --> 10:07.778
Amy, I don't understand,
are we broken up or not?

10:07.846 --> 10:09.380
It's like you can't
make up your mind.

10:09.448 --> 10:12.450
It's because you're not
giving me any space to think.

10:12.518 --> 10:13.751
Well, you should think fast,

10:13.819 --> 10:16.221
because men can sire offspring
their entire lives,

10:16.288 --> 10:19.357
but those eggs you're toting
around have a sell-by date.

10:23.129 --> 10:25.896
You know what, Sheldon,
you've made this really easy.

10:25.964 --> 10:29.267
You're immature, you're selfish,
you just insulted me to my face.

10:29.335 --> 10:31.636
I don't need any more time
to think. We're broken up.

10:31.703 --> 10:32.870
Amy...

10:35.240 --> 10:36.741
Will someone take me home?

10:36.808 --> 10:37.842
Yeah. Come on,
I'll give you a ride.

10:37.909 --> 10:40.611
...symbolizes your eternal love.

10:40.679 --> 10:44.248
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

10:46.217 --> 10:47.051
We did it!

10:47.119 --> 10:50.755
I'm so glad
you guys could watch!

10:50.822 --> 10:54.324
We'll say it was beautiful
in the comment section.

11:04.923 --> 11:06.656
No, no, no. Hang on.

11:06.724 --> 11:09.926
I believe I'm supposed to
carry you across the threshold.

11:09.994 --> 11:12.461
Can you?

11:12.530 --> 11:14.230
Who do you think
carries Sheldon to bed

11:14.297 --> 11:16.765
when he falls asleep
in front of the TV?

11:16.833 --> 11:18.567
Okay, let's do it.

11:27.577 --> 11:29.778
You gonna make it?
I'm okay!

11:32.449 --> 11:34.550
Nicely done!

11:34.617 --> 11:35.951
Thank you.

11:36.019 --> 11:37.085
Finally, there's
a Mrs. Hofstadter

11:37.153 --> 11:39.654
who isn't disappointed in me.

11:39.721 --> 11:41.722
Well, the night is still young.

11:53.802 --> 11:55.603
Everything all right?

11:56.638 --> 11:58.906
Yeah. I guess.

11:58.974 --> 12:01.709
Just tell me.

12:02.678 --> 12:03.844
It's just, when we were kissing,

12:03.912 --> 12:06.280
I couldn't help but picture
you with that other girl.

12:06.347 --> 12:07.281
Oh, no.

12:07.348 --> 12:08.583
No, come on.

12:08.650 --> 12:09.884
I have a friend in you.

12:09.952 --> 12:12.119
You said so.

12:12.187 --> 12:13.854
You're right.
Just forget it.

12:13.922 --> 12:15.890
Yeah.

12:19.661 --> 12:22.096
Okay, listen. Uh...

12:22.163 --> 12:25.399
If you're imagining that
it was sexy, it wasn't.

12:25.467 --> 12:28.235
We-we were both drunk, and
she smelled like an ashtray.

12:28.303 --> 12:31.871
The boat was moving a lot,
so I chipped her tooth.

12:31.939 --> 12:33.974
Did you feel guilty?

12:34.041 --> 12:36.477
No, she had
dental insurance.

12:36.544 --> 12:40.714
Did you feel guilty
after kissing her?

12:40.781 --> 12:43.883
Yes. I felt guilty as
soon as it happened.

12:43.951 --> 12:47.020
I feel guilty
every time I see her.

12:47.088 --> 12:49.889
What do you mean,
every time you see her?

12:49.957 --> 12:51.891
What... do I mean?

12:51.959 --> 12:54.527
Boy, that's a toughie.

12:54.595 --> 12:57.130
You still see her?

12:57.197 --> 12:59.132
Well, no, not socially.

12:59.199 --> 13:00.366
But, you know,
just at work.

13:00.434 --> 13:02.869
You work with her?!

13:02.937 --> 13:04.437
How could you not tell me that?!

13:04.505 --> 13:06.973
I wanted to tell you in the car,
but you told me to stop talking!

13:07.041 --> 13:08.608
Oh, okay. So you're saying
this is my fault?

13:08.676 --> 13:10.110
No, of course not.

13:10.177 --> 13:11.745
Okay, l-look,

13:11.812 --> 13:13.146
instead of fighting,

13:13.213 --> 13:15.715
why don't we dim the lights,

13:15.783 --> 13:19.618
um, get naked and make a baby?

13:26.126 --> 13:28.994
I was trying
to lighten the mood.

13:29.062 --> 13:32.330
It's not easy. You try it.

13:33.599 --> 13:34.667
Hello, Mother.

13:34.734 --> 13:36.935
Shelly! How's my baby doing?

13:37.003 --> 13:38.403
I just wanted to let you know

13:38.471 --> 13:41.406
that you can remove Amy
from your nightly prayers.

13:41.474 --> 13:43.208
Unless you're open
to praying for

13:43.276 --> 13:45.510
a beehive to fall on her head.

13:45.578 --> 13:47.712
Oh, what's going on?

13:47.780 --> 13:49.013
She broke up with me.

13:49.081 --> 13:50.481
Oh, Shelly.

13:50.549 --> 13:51.282
No, I'll be okay.

13:51.349 --> 13:53.217
But I think that I'd like

13:53.285 --> 13:55.953
to send the ring back to you.

13:56.021 --> 13:57.121
Well, let's not be hasty.

13:57.189 --> 13:58.923
Are you sure it's over for good?

13:58.991 --> 14:01.125
It's over for me.
I'm done with women.

14:01.193 --> 14:03.061
Like when I swore off Pop Rocks.

14:03.128 --> 14:06.330
They both hurt you on purpose.

14:06.398 --> 14:08.399
You want to tell me
what happened?

14:08.466 --> 14:10.701
Are you going to say
it's all part of God's plan?

14:10.768 --> 14:11.601
Good chance.

14:11.669 --> 14:13.804
Then no, thank you.

14:13.871 --> 14:15.605
Well, honey,
don't send it back yet.

14:15.673 --> 14:17.833
Your sister's married,
and I'm not letting your brother

14:17.875 --> 14:21.511
give my grandmother's ring
to that whore he's dating.

14:21.579 --> 14:25.348
Wasn't Mary Magdalene
a woman of ill repute?

14:25.416 --> 14:28.051
When your idiot brother
redeems mankind,

14:28.119 --> 14:31.221
he can date whoever he wants.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.726
I know it hurts now,
but it's gonna get better.

14:35.793 --> 14:36.726
Yeah.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.094
Everything's gonna be okay.

14:38.161 --> 14:40.996
You've got so
much to offer.

14:41.064 --> 14:42.264
Thank you.

14:42.332 --> 14:44.600
Any man would be
lucky to have you.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.202
That's true.

14:46.269 --> 14:48.570
I just hope
I did the right thing.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.972
I'm sure you did.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.142
Maybe that's the problem--
you always do the right thing.

14:53.210 --> 14:56.612
Maybe it's time to
do the wrong thing.

15:03.285 --> 15:06.420
Like you're doing right now?

15:08.323 --> 15:10.925
Exactly.

15:14.329 --> 15:16.631
I asked you over and
over if you were okay.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.938
Why would you go through with
the wedding if you weren't?

15:19.001 --> 15:22.036
I thought I was okay,
but it turns out I'm not.

15:22.104 --> 15:24.773
Okay, listen, I may not
have been entirely faithful,

15:24.840 --> 15:27.308
but you,
you are not easy to lift!

15:32.147 --> 15:33.147
Wow!

15:33.214 --> 15:35.182
Well, marriage must agree
with you.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.352
Well, you are just glowing.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.691
I'm not glowing.

15:43.759 --> 15:45.293
I'm upset.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.462
Well, whatever it is,
it agrees with you.

15:57.438 --> 16:00.274
Knock, knock,
knock, Penny?

16:00.341 --> 16:03.576
Knock, knock, knock, Penny?
Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

16:05.914 --> 16:07.014
What's this?

16:07.081 --> 16:08.282
Leonard told me what happened,

16:08.349 --> 16:11.151
so I took it upon myself
to make you a hot beverage.

16:11.219 --> 16:12.820
Oh. That's so sweet of you.

16:12.887 --> 16:14.421
Yeah. I know.

16:15.522 --> 16:16.889
Turns out, being sweet

16:16.957 --> 16:19.425
isn't enough
to keep a girl these days.

16:19.492 --> 16:21.493
I blame Madonna.

16:21.561 --> 16:24.496
I'm sorry to hear
about you and Amy.

16:24.564 --> 16:25.965
Well, I'm sorry
about Leonard.

16:26.033 --> 16:27.513
Thought I raised him
better than that.

16:27.567 --> 16:30.636
You know, it's bad enough
what happened,

16:30.704 --> 16:33.239
but then he tried to hide
the fact that he sees her

16:33.307 --> 16:35.174
all the time
at the university.

16:35.242 --> 16:37.576
He does? Who is it?

16:37.644 --> 16:39.911
Some girl named Mandy.

16:40.747 --> 16:43.081
Mandy Chao?
Yeah.

16:43.149 --> 16:44.817
Oh, you don't need
to worry about her.

16:44.884 --> 16:46.017
She's brilliant and attractive.

16:46.085 --> 16:48.520
She can do way better
than Leonard.

16:53.025 --> 16:54.560
That's great.

16:55.895 --> 16:57.262
Wait a minute.

16:57.330 --> 16:59.264
I know this may
sound farfetched,

16:59.332 --> 17:00.999
but I'm on the market now.

17:01.067 --> 17:02.800
You know, if I dated Mandy,

17:02.869 --> 17:05.770
that would teach both
Leonard and Amy a lesson.

17:05.838 --> 17:07.339
That's ridiculous.

17:07.406 --> 17:09.540
Oh, you're right.
I could never be with a woman

17:09.608 --> 17:12.344
whose self-esteem was so low
she'd be with Leonard.

17:12.411 --> 17:15.079
I'm with Leonard.

17:15.146 --> 17:17.548
Yeah, I know. Forever.

17:19.651 --> 17:22.587
Who would have believed
these things would happen to us?

17:22.654 --> 17:24.122
Right?

17:24.190 --> 17:27.125
I can't believe Amy
actually went through with it.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.460
Hang on.

17:29.528 --> 17:32.096
You knew that she was
going to end it with me?

17:32.163 --> 17:33.864
Did you try
and stop her?

17:33.932 --> 17:38.102
I told her to be true to herself
and do what makes her happy.

17:38.169 --> 17:39.336
Do what makes her happy?

17:39.404 --> 17:41.906
She plays the harp and
her car is paid for.

17:41.973 --> 17:44.041
How much happier can she be?

17:44.876 --> 17:46.643
Okay, look, it's not my fault

17:46.711 --> 17:49.313
that she thought
you were a bad boyfriend.

17:50.382 --> 17:52.216
I see.

17:52.284 --> 17:54.285
Well...

17:58.188 --> 18:00.056
I think I'll be going.

18:00.958 --> 18:02.725
Sheldon...
No, no, no, no.

18:02.793 --> 18:05.128
We are done here.

18:08.432 --> 18:10.333
Would you mind
opening the door

18:10.401 --> 18:13.569
and then angrily slamming it
behind me?

18:14.504 --> 18:16.005
Sure.

18:16.073 --> 18:17.974
Thank you.

18:18.042 --> 18:19.675
And slam it hard,

18:19.743 --> 18:21.444
because I am pretty steamed.

18:24.047 --> 18:25.815
All right, Leonard,
hang in there.

18:25.882 --> 18:28.083
Talk to you tomorrow.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.787
What happened?
They just got married.

18:31.855 --> 18:33.255
I don't know.

18:33.323 --> 18:36.625
It's a mess.
They had a huge fight in Vegas.

18:36.693 --> 18:37.860
Think they'll break up?

18:37.928 --> 18:40.128
I don't know. Sounds pretty bad.

18:40.196 --> 18:42.931
Penny's back in her apartment
all by herself.

18:42.999 --> 18:45.367
Really?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.268
Would you like to hear
another reason

18:58.336 --> 19:00.203
why men are
better than women?

19:00.270 --> 19:04.506
Sure, let's make it
an even hundred.

19:04.574 --> 19:07.176
You would never kiss me
and make me say "I love you"

19:07.244 --> 19:08.845
and then break up with me.

19:08.912 --> 19:11.780
I wouldn't.

19:11.849 --> 19:14.250
And you know why?

19:14.318 --> 19:15.784
'Cause you're a man.

19:15.853 --> 19:19.288
The champagne of genders.

19:19.356 --> 19:21.457
Well, I may be a man,

19:21.524 --> 19:24.360
but I think I'm the one
that screwed up on this one.

19:24.427 --> 19:27.996
Yeah, well, and you admit it,
like a man.

19:28.064 --> 19:29.464
All you hear
women say is,

19:29.531 --> 19:32.133
"I'll just have a salad."
You know?

19:32.201 --> 19:33.935
"Where's my lip gloss?"

19:34.003 --> 19:36.671
"I think this element
should be called radium."

19:38.474 --> 19:41.109
That last one was Madame Curie.

19:41.177 --> 19:43.811
I figured that out.

19:43.879 --> 19:46.247
You know what?
She was kind of an honorary man.

19:46.314 --> 19:49.684
She had a penis made of science.

19:53.054 --> 19:56.591
Can't believe I'm spending
my wedding night with you.

19:56.658 --> 19:57.992
Really?

19:58.059 --> 20:00.227
I never imagined it
any other way.
