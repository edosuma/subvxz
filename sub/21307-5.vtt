00:02.603 --> 00:08.107
¶ ¶

00:13.547 --> 00:16.014
SUE AIKENS: THIS IS HOW I
STORE MY WATER FOR THE WINTER.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.517
I FILL UP MY
LITTLE BARRELS.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.353
I HAVE ROUGHLY 300 DAYS OF
WINTER THAT I HAVE NO RUNNING

00:21.455 --> 00:24.990
WATER BEFORE THE
RIVER STARTS BREAKING UP AND

00:25.092 --> 00:27.860
IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH
THAT I CAN PUMP AGAIN.

00:28.562 --> 00:32.197
I GIVE MYSELF ROUGHLY
ONE GALLON OF WATER PER DAY.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.067
BASICALLY, I'M HOVERING
RIGHT ABOVE DEHYDRATION.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.369
AND I GET NINE
MONTHS OF WINTER AND

00:37.471 --> 00:38.937
I'M HALFWAY THROUGH THAT.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.940
AND IF YOU LOOK
AROUND, I'VE GOT ROCKS.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.675
YOU'VE GOT A
REALLY DIRTY PRODUCT.

00:43.778 --> 00:45.177
IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR DRINKING.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.212
BUT YOU CAN SEE ALL
MY BRUSH HANGING UP.

00:47.314 --> 00:50.115
WHAT I'M NOT
GETTING IS SNOW.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.985
THERE'S NO DRIFTING
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.854
THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR MY
DRINKING AND MY WASHING WATER.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.056
IT HAS ME CONCERNED.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.293
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST
VALUABLE RESOURCES I HAVE.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.995
WATER IS THE GIFT OF LIFE.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.963
I'VE GOTTA FIND IT.

01:06.233 --> 01:12.471
<i>¶ [THEME MUSIC PLAYS] ¶</i>

01:28.722 --> 01:31.056
TODAY I'M GONNA GO DOWN
A COUPLE OF PLACES THAT I

01:31.158 --> 01:34.359
USUALLY, EVERY WINTER,
HAVE SOME OPEN LEADS,

01:34.628 --> 01:37.863
AND SEE IF I CAN GET
GOOD, SAFE DRINKING WATER.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.666
ALWAYS BRING MY
LITTLE BACKPACK.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.268
I'VE GOT A SHOVEL THERE, I'M
ALSO GONNA USE IT FOR THE SNOW.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.237
I CAN GET IN THE ARGO.

01:45.339 --> 01:49.408
IF I GET TOO COLD, I HAVE A
QUICK LITTLE STOVE THAT I CAN

01:49.510 --> 01:51.577
TAKE SNOW, MELT IT,
MAKE MYSELF A CUP OF

01:51.679 --> 01:52.711
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

01:52.813 --> 01:53.946
I GOT LITTLE SNACKS.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.080
EXTRA GLOVES.

01:55.182 --> 01:58.183
OUT HERE, TEMPERATURE
CHANGES ARE PRETTY AMAZING,

01:58.285 --> 01:59.551
AND THEY HAPPEN
WITH NO NOTICE,

01:59.653 --> 02:02.187
SAME WITH THE
BLIZZARDS THAT COME IN.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.460
THIS IS WHERE, DOWN
HERE IS WHERE I GET

02:08.562 --> 02:10.362
MY WATER IN THE SUMMER.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.798
IT BEHOOVES ME TO
JUST LOOK AND SEE.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.534
IF I HAVE AN OPEN LEAD
RIGHT HERE, PROBLEM SOLVED.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.403
THEN I DON'T HAVE TO RUIN
A WHOLE DAY DOING SOMETHING.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.973
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT
I'M DEALING WITH HERE.

02:28.182 --> 02:31.850
COMING DOWN, ALL'S
I DID WAS DRIVE OVER IT,

02:33.387 --> 02:35.387
AND I'VE GOT GRAVEL SHOWING.

02:35.589 --> 02:39.157
YOU CAN SEE, THIS IS ONE
OF THE AREAS HERE, THAT I WILL,

02:39.260 --> 02:42.294
EVERY YEAR HAVE
SNOW AND SNOW DRIFTS.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.063
VERY LITTLE SNOW AND
PRECIPITATION COMING DOWN

02:45.165 --> 02:48.600
THIS WINTER, BUT WE
DID BOTTOM OUT, FORTY,

02:48.702 --> 02:51.470
FIFTY BELOW ZERO
FOR TWO, THREE WEEKS.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.906
WHAT DOES THAT DO
TO YOUR WATER TABLE?

02:54.008 --> 02:55.908
POPS IT TO SMITHEREENS.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.610
YEAH, DEFINITELY
A SOURCE OF CONCERN.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.379
THERE'S NOT
A CLEAN SOURCE.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.147
THERE'S NOT
A DEEP SOURCE.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.983
I'VE GOTTA KEEP LOOKING.

03:08.923 --> 03:10.689
GLENN VILLENEUVE: OUT HERE,
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

03:10.791 --> 03:11.924
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.525
IF I WANNA TAKE A
RISK, IT'S MY BUSINESS.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.827
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

03:25.339 --> 03:32.110
¶ ¶

03:33.681 --> 03:35.881
FIRST THING I NEED TO DO
TODAY IS GET MYSELF SOME WATER.

03:35.983 --> 03:36.982
I'M ALL OUT OF WATER.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.851
I DON'T HAVE ANY
WATER TO DRINK RIGHT NOW.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.121
IT'S BEEN A FEW
DAYS SINCE I OPENED UP

03:43.223 --> 03:44.923
MY WATER HOLE
HERE IN THE ICE.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.192
I KEEP IT BURIED IN
SNOW TO INSULATE IT.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.595
THIS IS WHERE I GET ALL
MY WATER FOR DRINKING.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.697
COOKING.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.065
CLEANING.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.299
BATHING.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.335
DOING MY LAUNDRY.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.377
FORTY BELOW ZERO.

04:05.512 --> 04:09.014
COLD WEATHER TO GET WATER,
BUT THAT'S WHAT I GOTTA DO.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.650
THERE WE GO.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.252
NOW, I SHOULD BE
ABLE TO GET WATER.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.056
ONCE I GET
THIS HOLE OPEN,

04:18.158 --> 04:19.758
I HAVE ACCESS
TO UNLIMITED WATER.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.693
I CAN TAKE AS MANY
BUCKETS OF WATER AS I WANT.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.228
IF I MELT SNOW,
THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME,

04:23.330 --> 04:24.763
THAT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.866
THAT'S TIME AND ENERGY
I DON'T HAVE OUT HERE.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.103
IT'S A LOT OF
WORK LIVING OUT HERE,

04:31.205 --> 04:34.806
JUST TO GET BASIC THINGS
LIKE WATER, AND HEAT, AND FOOD.

04:35.542 --> 04:39.177
BUT LOOK AT THE
ENVIRONMENT I GET TO LIVE IN.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.712
LOOK AT THE BEAUTY
I'M SURROUNDED BY.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.615
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.756
THERE ARE A LOT OF
THINGS TO SEE OUT HERE.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.358
AND TONIGHT, THERE'S GONNA
BE SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THE SKY.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.927
THERE'S GONNA BE A SUPERMOON.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.163
THAT'S WHEN THE FULL
MOON IS A LITTLE CLOSER

04:58.265 --> 04:59.965
TO THE EARTH THAN NORMAL.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.135
AND IT'S BIGGER AND IT'S
BRIGHTER THAN AT OTHER TIMES.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.971
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.976
I LIKE THIS KIND OF JOB.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.211
YOU KNOW, IN MODERN SOCIETY,
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO DO

05:13.313 --> 05:15.781
STUFF LIKE THIS.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.015
OUT HERE,
IT'S MORE PRIMAL.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.951
YOU GET TO REALLY
USE YOUR STRENGTH,

05:20.054 --> 05:21.720
AND TAKE OUT
SOME AGGRESSION.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.990
I MEAN, LOOK AT, IT'S
LIKE, MM, IT'S PERMANENT!

05:26.193 --> 05:28.026
I HIT WATER.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.262
YEAH!

05:30.364 --> 05:32.764
AH, YEAH.

05:35.736 --> 05:41.073
OH, LOOK AT THAT WATER.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.911
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.116
AFTER I GET MY WATER TODAY,

05:51.218 --> 05:53.719
I WANNA GET SOME
ICE FROM THIS AREA, TOO.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.488
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,
I DUG A HOLE IN THE GROUND

05:56.590 --> 05:57.989
TO USE AS A REFRIGERATOR.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.057
IT WORKS REALLY WELL.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.425
IT KEEPS MY FOOD COOLER.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.662
BUT IN THE SUMMERTIME,
EVEN UNDERGROUND IT WARMS UP.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.897
AFTER I GET MY WATER
OUT OF MY WATER HOLE HERE,

06:05.999 --> 06:08.300
I WANNA TAKE PIECES
OF ICE FROM THE LAKE,

06:08.402 --> 06:09.968
BRING THEM UP TO
MY REFRIGERATOR HOLE,

06:10.070 --> 06:11.236
AND PUT THEM IN THERE.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.505
THAT WAY, NEXT
SUMMER, WHEN IT WARMS UP,

06:13.607 --> 06:17.042
THAT ICE UNDERGROUND
WILL KEEP MY FOOD COOL.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.714
OKAY, I GOT MY WATER,
I'M GONNA BRING IT IN,

06:22.816 --> 06:26.218
THEN I'M GONNA COME BACK
OUT AND GET MYSELF SOME ICE.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.324
JESSIE HOLMES: I'VE PUSHED
IT ABOUT AS HARD AS YOU CAN UP

06:32.426 --> 06:35.160
HERE, AND BEEN BLESSED
BY THE LORD TO SURVIVE.

06:44.138 --> 06:47.773
<i>[BARKING]</i>

06:48.108 --> 06:50.575
OVER HERE, I GOT THIS SLED
THAT I'VE BEEN LIMPING ALONG

06:50.677 --> 06:52.844
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS
FOR DOING MY WORKLOAD.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.647
BUT IT'S KIND
OF JUST DESTROYED.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.251
BARELY HANGING ON,
THE STANCHIONS ARE BREAKING.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.455
FOR AS MUCH AS I USE THE SLED,
THIS ISN'T REALLY ACCEPTABLE.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.890
TODAY, I'M GONNA
START FROM SCRATCH AND

07:04.992 --> 07:06.558
START BUILDING A NEW SLED.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.260
IT'S GONNA BE
GOOD FOR WORKING.

07:08.362 --> 07:10.896
BUT IT'S ALSO GONNA BE
GOOD FOR TRAINING MY RACE DOGS.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.666
<i>NARRATOR: JESSIE HOLMES</i>

07:18.872 --> 07:21.706

<i>DURING WINTER, JESSIE USES THE</i>

07:27.881 --> 07:30.048
JESSIE HOLMES: I'M GONNA BUILD
A KIND OF A HYBRID SLED THAT I

07:30.150 --> 07:33.852
CAN USE TO TRAIN MY RACE DOGS,
BUT I CAN ALSO HAUL HEAVY

07:33.954 --> 07:36.922
LOADS WITH IT THAT I NEED TO
DO CONSTANTLY AROUND HERE TO

07:37.024 --> 07:40.358
KEEP FIREWOOD SUPPLIED,
HAUL THINGS OUT TO CAMP,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.928
TRAPPING, HUNTING.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.498
I MEAN, THIS IS GONNA BE
THE SLED THAT CAN DO IT ALL.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.236
FIRST THING I NEED TO DO
IS GATHER UP ALL MY MATERIALS.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.805
I NEED TO GET SOME
WILLOWS FOR MY TOP STRINGERS,

07:53.907 --> 07:56.174
SO I'M GONNA HEAD BACK INTO
THE WOODS AND DOWN THE SLOUGH

07:56.276 --> 07:58.910
AND LOOK FOR
SOME NICE WILLOWS.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.347
THIS IS A NICE PIECE.

08:02.449 --> 08:05.150
SO, A DATE FOOTMARK
IS GETTING A LITTLE THIN,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.385
BUT THAT MIGHT WORK.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.021
THAT'S A PRETTY
GOOD PIECE ACTUALLY.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.260
ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS
I'M LOOKING FOR IS THE CORRECT

08:15.362 --> 08:18.964
DIAMETER THAT I CAN ACTUALLY
COUNT ON THAT WILL BEND.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.167
WILLOW IS PRETTY STRONG WOOD.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.469
A LOT OF THE PIECES THAT I'M
USING ON THE SLED ARE ALREADY

08:24.571 --> 08:27.706
GONNA COST QUITE A BIT,
SO TRY TO USE WHATEVER I

08:27.808 --> 08:31.643
GOT OUT HERE TO LOWER THE
PRICE OF BUILDING THIS THING.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.017
ALL RIGHT, I GOT MY
WILLOWS FOR MY STRINGERS,

08:39.119 --> 08:42.954
AND NOW I GOT TO GO OVER
AND DIG OUT SOME WHITE SPRUCE

08:43.056 --> 08:46.258
LUMBER THAT I MILLED UP
THIS FALL WITH MY SAWMILL.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.894
THE WHOLE REASON FOR GETTING
THIS THING SET UP IN THE FALL

08:48.996 --> 08:50.962
IS SO I COULD USE
IT COME SPRINGTIME.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.098
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO ENSURE
THAT I HAD SOME LUMBER WHEN I

08:53.200 --> 08:55.367
NEED IT, AND RIGHT NOW
IS THE TIME WHEN I NEED IT.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.978
AROUND HERE, IT ALL
GOES BACK TO THE TREES.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.848
TREES PROVIDE THE WAY OF
LIFE THAT WE LIVE OUT HERE.

09:10.183 --> 09:13.685
FROM HEATING THE HOUSE
TO BUILDING THE HOUSE,

09:13.787 --> 09:16.554
FROM THE START OF THE
GROWING TREE TO THE BEGINNING

09:16.657 --> 09:19.090
OF A SLED THAT CAN
PROVIDE ME WITH LOTS.

09:19.293 --> 09:20.525
THAT'S PRETTY
COOL RIGHT THERE.

09:20.627 --> 09:23.461
THAT'S THE KIND OF LIFE
I'M TRYING TO ACHIEVE OUT HERE.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.699
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S AN
EXTRA PIECE THAN I NEED.

09:27.801 --> 09:31.069
SO THAT GIVES ME PLENTY
OF PIECES TO WORK WITH HERE.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.605
THAT I GOT
EVERYTHING ALL TOGETHER,

09:33.707 --> 09:35.874
MY NEXT THING TO
MOVE ON TO IS STARTING

09:35.976 --> 09:38.677
TO PUT THE BED TOGETHER.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.616
ANDY BASSICH: I VALUE
HAVING PEOPLE IN MY LIFE,

09:44.718 --> 09:46.885
BUT I ALSO
VALUE MY TIME ALONE.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.654
AND I REALLY VALUE
MY TIME IN THE WILDERNESS.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.661
OH, TOOPY.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.164
WANNA BE A PACK DOG?

09:59.533 --> 10:02.400
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.902
SUN'S JUST UP.

10:04.004 --> 10:08.373
I'M PLANNING ON GOING OUT AND
PUTTING IN A WALKING TRAPLINE.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.910
BASICALLY, THE YUKON RIVER
TAKES A GREAT BIG TURN LIKE

10:12.012 --> 10:14.846
THIS AND I LIVE
ABOUT RIGHT HERE.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.415
AND THERE'S A REALLY NICE
RIDGELINE THAT GOES ALL THE

10:17.517 --> 10:19.050
WAY AROUND THIS BEND HERE.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.419
SO, I WANNA MUSH
ALL THE WAY AROUND AND

10:21.521 --> 10:23.021
PUT IN A BIG GIANT LOOP.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.757
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT
THAT THERE WILL BE MARTEN,

10:25.859 --> 10:28.560
WOLVERINE, AND POSSIBLY
SOME LYNX ALONG THIS LINE.

10:29.363 --> 10:32.163
<i>NARRATOR: FOR ANDY BASSICH,</i>

ANDY BASSICH: FOR ME,
MARTEN IS A DOLLAR BILL.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.189
BOTTOM LINE, YOU
DEFINITELY GOT TO MAKE SOME

10:58.291 --> 10:59.791
KIND OF MONEY OUT HERE.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.694
HUP.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.470
THERE'S NO REASON TO GO OUT
IN THE WILDERNESS AND SUFFER.

11:12.572 --> 11:15.607
IF YOU JUST PUT THE WORK IN
AND YOU PUT THE PLANNING IN,

11:15.709 --> 11:17.575
LIFE OUT IN A
WILDERNESS ENVIRONMENT CAN BE

11:17.677 --> 11:21.613
VERY SATISFYING, VERY
REWARDING, AND COMFORTABLE.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.115
HUP-HUP.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.551
YES, OOH, LET'S STOP HERE.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.586
UP A LITTLE, UP A LITTLE.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.655
GOOD BOYS.

11:32.225 --> 11:36.261
BASICALLY, THE RIDGELINE
GOES THAT WAY AND THAT WAY.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.998
I'M GONNA HEAD OFF IN
THIS DIRECTION TO THE NORTH,

11:40.100 --> 11:45.370
AND IT'LL MAKE A GIANT LOOP,
AND SEE IF I CAN DO THIS

11:45.472 --> 11:46.704
BEFORE IT GETS TOO DARK.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.207
IF NOT, IT'S
GONNA BE A COLD NIGHT.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.810
TOPAZ GETS A PACK.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.813
MAKE THIS A LITTLE LONGER,
'CAUSE YOU PUT ON WEIGHT!

11:55.148 --> 11:56.514
YOU'RE A FAT GIRL NOW!

11:56.616 --> 11:58.116
I'LL PROBABLY PUT
ICEBERG ON THE PACK,

11:58.218 --> 12:00.285
'CAUSE HE LISTENS
A LITTLE BETTER.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.187
KRUG, I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA LUCK OUT, BUDDY.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.256
MAYBE YOU CARRY THE PACK
ON THE SECOND HALF, BUDDY.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.658
COME ON, BOYS.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.761
BERGY, TOPAZ, KRUG!

12:12.566 --> 12:14.999
COME ON, BOYS.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.811
I LIKE IT, THESE LITTLE
CLUSTERS OF TREES LIKE THIS IS

12:26.913 --> 12:28.279
ALWAYS A GOOD PLACE.

12:28.381 --> 12:32.350
FORMS A NATURAL BARRIER AND
DOESN'T SNOW IN YOUR TRAPS.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.887
PRIMARILY
FOR TRAPPING MARTEN,

12:35.989 --> 12:38.523
I USE A POLE SET
WHERE I CUT A POLE.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.492
I USUALLY STICK 'EM DOWN
IN THE TUNDRA AND THAT HELPS,

12:40.594 --> 12:43.661
MAKE ROOM IN PLACE.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.597
COME HERE, BERGY.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.099
I NEED SOME BAIT
AND NAILS, BUDDY.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.568
YOU'RE THE
BAIT AND NAIL GUY.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.137
NAIL IT TO A TREE.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.272
WIRE MY TRAP ON REAL GOOD.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.375
TAKING SOME WHOLE SALMON.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.145
MOST OF THE TIME I HANG 'EM
ON A PIECE OF WIRE LIKE THIS.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.314
AND THEN, THEY'RE
THERE YEAR AFTER YEAR.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.416
I DON'T HAVE TO
REDO THOSE EVERY YEAR.

13:05.519 --> 13:09.020
THIS IS JUST A MARTEN
LURE AND SOME SHELLFISH OIL.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.490
THIS CREATES A SCENT
WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL

13:12.592 --> 13:14.526
DRAW THE MARTEN IN.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.960
JUST PUT A
LITTLE BIT OF THIS.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.863
OOH, THAT SMELLS
REALLY NICE AND STINKY.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.565
THINK THIS IS
MADE OUT OF SOME OF THE

13:20.667 --> 13:23.268
ANAL GLANDS OF THE MARTEN.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.537
FINGERS ARE
ALREADY PRETTY COLD AND

13:25.639 --> 13:27.505
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.607
I GOTTA GET MOVING
TO WARM UP A LITTLE BIT.

13:29.976 --> 13:30.909
COME HERE, BOYS!

13:31.011 --> 13:33.278
WE'RE OFF TO THE RACES.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.585
SUE AIKENS: THE LEVEL OF
COMFORT I ENJOY IN MY LIFE IS

13:40.687 --> 13:43.588
ABSOLUTELY DIRECTLY
RELATED TO HOW HARD I'VE

13:43.690 --> 13:45.957
WORKED TO ATTAIN IT.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.868
<i>NARRATOR: AN UNUSUALLY WARM</i>
<i>WINTER IN KAVIK HAS PRODUCED</i>

13:56.970 --> 13:59.437
<i>LOW AMOUNTS OF SNOW</i>
<i>AND DRASTICALLY REDUCED</i>

13:59.539 --> 14:01.839
<i>SUE AIKEN'S WATER SUPPLY.</i>

14:01.942 --> 14:04.075
<i>WITHOUT RUNNING</i>
<i>WATER UNTIL SPRING,</i>

14:04.177 --> 14:05.910
<i>SHE MUST FIND A</i>
<i>LEAD OR DRIFTS IN ORDER TO</i>

14:06.012 --> 14:08.379
<i>GET BY UNTIL</i>
<i>THE RIVER OPENS UP.</i>

14:09.849 --> 14:11.783
SUE AIKENS: MAYBE I'LL FIND
A GREAT DRIFT HALF A MILE THIS

14:11.885 --> 14:13.818
WAY AND THAT WILL
SOLVE MY WHOLE ISSUE.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.820
IF NOT, I DO HAVE SOME SKIS.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.590
I CAN GET ON MY SKIS,
MAYBE DROP INTO THE RIVER

14:18.692 --> 14:19.691
AND SEE WHAT'S THERE.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.025
LOOK FOR OPEN LEADS.

14:21.127 --> 14:24.229
AN OPEN LEAD OR A HUGE
DRIFT IS GONNA BE MY FRIEND.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.900
ALL RIGHTY.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.002
I'VE GOT SOME PRETTY
BIG TRACK DOWN HERE,

14:31.104 --> 14:32.937
BUT I HAVE NO OPEN WATER.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.007
I'M LOOKING FOR THE
DRIFTS, THERE ARE NONE.

14:36.376 --> 14:41.346
YEAH, I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MORE CONCERNED NOW.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.051
I ENJOY DOING THIS.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.219
IT'S A DAY OUT OF CAMP.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.554
IT'S A DAY TO
PLAY IN THE SNOW.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.189
WHO THE HELL
DOESN'T LIKE THAT?

15:01.501 --> 15:02.667
(BLEEP).

15:06.906 --> 15:09.006
SUE AIKENS: (BLEEP).

15:10.042 --> 15:12.410
I'M (BLEEP) STUCK.

15:18.451 --> 15:22.253
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LITTLE RED SAID,

15:22.355 --> 15:25.689
"NO, MY TINY SUMMER TIRES
JUST CAN'T GET ANY MORE TREAD."

15:25.892 --> 15:29.727
WHAT I'M GONNA DO
IS GET THE SHOVEL,

15:29.829 --> 15:34.265
AND GET LITTLE RED DUG OUT,
GET HIM BACK THAT DIRECTION.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.969
AND WHAT I'M JUST
GONNA DO IS TRY TO GET

15:39.071 --> 15:42.373
SOME OF THIS SNOW MOVED.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.409
AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE,
IT HIGH-CENTERS ITSELF.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.615
BUT I'M HITTING
THE GROUND ALREADY.

15:51.717 --> 15:55.453
IT'S JUST THAT,
IT'S JUST THAT MUCH.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.123
TWO, THREE
INCHES TOO DEEP.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.927
YOU CAN LAY ALL YOUR PLANS
IN AND MOTHER NATURE WILL TAKE

16:03.029 --> 16:05.329
YOU RIGHT DOWN TO
YOUR KNEES IN A HEARTBEAT.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.731
NOT EMOTIONAL, DOESN'T GIVE
A (BLEEP), IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.601
YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKEN
DOWN AND CRYING FOR MAMA.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.938
THAT'S JUST WHAT
IT IS TO LIVE OUT HERE.

16:16.142 --> 16:20.811
WELL, LET'S GET IN AND SEE
IF I CAN'T JOSTLE IT AROUND.

16:31.257 --> 16:37.595
¶ ¶

16:46.939 --> 16:52.209
¶ ¶

17:02.321 --> 17:08.626
¶ ¶

17:11.931 --> 17:13.764
LITTLE RED IS JUST
HAVING TOO MUCH TROUBLE

17:13.866 --> 17:15.099
WITH THE SUGAR SNOW.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.501
IT'S PADDLING THROUGH IT,
BUT THE MINUTE IT GETS DEEP,

17:17.603 --> 17:19.169
IT'S GETTING HIGH-CENTERED,

17:19.272 --> 17:21.472
SO IT'S NOT WORTH
BREAKING THE VEHICLE.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.941
I HAVE SOME SKIS.

17:24.043 --> 17:27.545
GET SOME MINIMAL TOOLS,
THEN POKE ALONG AND SEE IF I CAN

17:27.647 --> 17:29.480
ORPHAN ANNIE MY
WAY OUT THERE AND SEE IF

17:29.582 --> 17:31.615
I CAN FIND LIQUID WATER.

17:33.452 --> 17:36.020
I'VE GOT MY TOTES WITH
MY GEAR INSIDE THAT I WANT.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.156
GOT MY SHOVEL.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.325
DON'T HAVE A WAIST HARNESS,
BUT I GOT A GUN BELT,

17:41.427 --> 17:43.127
SO THAT'S HOW I'M
ATTACHING MYSELF.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.529
BUT I WANNA GET GOING.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.534
I CAN LIVE WITHOUT
EVER DOING THE RUNWAY.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.670
I CAN LIVE WITHOUT
EVER CLEANING THE PAD.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.505
I CAN LIVE
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.841
A BODY CAN'T
LIVE WITHOUT WATER.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.315
ANDY BASSICH: CONFUCIUS
ONCE SAID THAT A MAN WHO

18:04.417 --> 18:07.184
LOVES HIS WORK NEVER
WORKS A DAY IN HIS LIFE,

18:07.286 --> 18:10.054
AND THAT'S KIND
OF THE WAY MY LIFE IS.

18:18.064 --> 18:21.031
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A GOOD SPOT FOR A SIT.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.767
I'VE ONLY GOT MAYBE
AN HOUR OF DAYLIGHT LEFT,

18:23.869 --> 18:25.469
SO I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA MAKE THE WHOLE

18:25.571 --> 18:28.038
LOOP IN ONE DAY.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.940
<i>NARRATOR: ANDY IS</i>
<i>TRAPPING FOR MARTEN,</i>

18:30.042 --> 18:33.043
<i>AN ANIMAL THAT WILL PROVIDE</i>
<i>VALUABLE FUR FOR CLOTHING AND</i>

18:33.145 --> 18:35.045
<i>TRADE IN DARK WINTER.</i>

18:37.350 --> 18:38.582
ANDY BASSICH:
BREAKING A NEW LINE OUT,

18:38.684 --> 18:40.651
YOU REALLY NEVER KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.187
YOU KIND OF
BUSHWHACK THROUGH THE WOODS,

18:43.289 --> 18:46.357
TRY AND NAVIGATE THE BEST YOU
CAN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE WOODS,

18:46.626 --> 18:49.259
AND IT JUST
TAKES A LONG TIME.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.828
SO FAR,
I'M DOING PRETTY GOOD.

18:50.930 --> 18:51.929
I'M MAKING OKAY TIME.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.530
IT ALWAYS TAKES LONGER
THAN YOU THINK WHEN YOU'RE

18:53.633 --> 18:55.899
GOING THE FIRST
TIME AND MAKING TRAPS.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.534
THERE'S THE TRAP.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.969
OKAY, BOYS.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.372
EVERYBODY COME, COME.

19:11.751 --> 19:17.921
¶ ¶

19:18.257 --> 19:23.260
WHAT I WANNA DO ABOUT EVERY
50 YARDS OR SO IS I LIKE JUST

19:23.362 --> 19:27.731
TAKING ALL THE LIMBS OFF OF
A TREE LIKE THIS, SMALL TREE,

19:27.833 --> 19:30.601
PUTTING A BLAZE
ON BOTH SIDES OF IT.

19:30.703 --> 19:34.038
THIS BLAZE WILL GET COVERED
WITH SAP NEXT SPRING.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.907
IT TURNS KIND OF A
REAL GOLDEN YELLOW COLOR

19:37.009 --> 19:39.143
AND THAT SHOWS
UP PRETTY GOOD.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.345
SO, THIS IS KIND OF LIKE
PUTTING THE BREADCRUMBS ON

19:41.447 --> 19:43.113
THE TRAIL, SO
YOU CAN FOLLOW YOUR,

19:43.215 --> 19:47.618
GET YOUR WAY HOME AGAIN.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.623
YEAH!

19:52.725 --> 19:53.957
WE'RE CRACKING.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.026
STARTING TO GET A LITTLE BIT
LATE AND I GOTTA LOOK FOR A

19:56.128 --> 19:59.163
PLACE TO CAMP FOR THE NIGHT.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.766
WE GOT REALLY SHORT HOURS
OF DAYLIGHT THIS TIME OF YEAR.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.402
ONCE IT'S DARK, IT'S
BEST JUST TO HUNKER DOWN,

20:05.504 --> 20:07.337
WAIT IT OUT UNTIL YOU
GET A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT,

20:07.440 --> 20:10.607
'CAUSE YOU CAN GET LOST
IN THESE WOODS REAL QUICK.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.577
HEY, HERE'S A
GOOD DEAD TREE, BERGY.

20:13.679 --> 20:14.778
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.081
YOU READY TO STOP
FOR THE NIGHT?

20:17.183 --> 20:20.017
WHOA, LOOK AT THAT, I
COVERED YOU UP WITH SNOW.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.787
OH, KRUG,
YOU'RE ALL SNOWED IN.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.989
I'M GONNA MAKE A
BED OF BOUGHS FIRST,

20:26.092 --> 20:29.059
AND THEN I'LL
BUILD MY FIRE.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.296
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FANCY,
IT JUST HAS TO KEEP ME OFF THE

20:32.398 --> 20:34.598
GROUND A LITTLE BIT.

20:34.700 --> 20:38.268
I'M NOT GONNA SAY I'M
GONNA BE COMFORTABLE ALL NIGHT.

20:38.370 --> 20:41.839
I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST
WINTER I HAD A THREE-DOG TEAM.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.341
I RAN OUT OF DAYLIGHT,
DECIDED I WOULD JUST CRAWL UP

20:44.443 --> 20:46.744
UNDER A TREE
AND SPEND THE NIGHT.

20:47.113 --> 20:50.247
I BUILT A FIRE, BUT
AT FORTY FIVE BELOW ZERO,

20:50.349 --> 20:51.915
UNLESS YOU'RE
SITTING ON TOP OF THE FIRE,

20:52.017 --> 20:54.485
IT REALLY DOESN'T
DO A LOT OF GOOD.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.620
I HAD PROBABLY ONE
OF THE COLDEST NIGHTS

20:56.722 --> 20:58.288
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.624
SOON AS THE LIGHT GOT JUST
A LITTLE BIT BRIGHT OUTSIDE,

21:00.726 --> 21:02.860
I PACKED UP AND HEADED BACK.

21:02.962 --> 21:06.196
YOU JUST LEARN WHEN YOU LIVE
OUT HERE TO TOLERATE A CERTAIN

21:06.298 --> 21:08.832
AMOUNT OF BEING COLD.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.969
I LOVE JUST THE EXPERIENCE
OF BEING IN THE WILDERNESS AND

21:12.071 --> 21:14.872
CARVING OUT A PIECE OF THIS
WILDERNESS TO BE ABLE TO LIVE

21:14.974 --> 21:17.841
THE KIND OF LIFE I WANNA LIVE.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.145
WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH
THIS NIGHT JUST FINE.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.714
I'LL HAVE A NICE WARM BED
AND A HOT CUP OF COFFEE WAITING

21:23.816 --> 21:26.483
FOR ME AT HOME.

21:26.685 --> 21:29.953
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

21:33.492 --> 21:35.359
JESSIE HOLMES: ULTIMATELY,
WHAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE OUT HERE

21:35.461 --> 21:38.462
IS YOUR RESPECT FOR THE
ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU LIVE IN.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.738
NOW IT'S TIME TO
START ASSEMBLING THE BED.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.440
I GOT MY MATERIALS TOGETHER.

21:51.043 --> 21:54.144
<i>NARRATOR: IN NENANA, JESSIE</i>
<i>IS BUILDING A HYBRID SLED THAT</i>

21:54.246 --> 21:57.080
<i>WILL ALLOW HIM TO HAUL VITAL</i>
<i>RESOURCES TO SURVIVE DARK</i>

21:57.183 --> 22:01.118
<i>WINTER, AND TRAIN HIS</i>
<i>SLED DOGS FOR UPCOMING RACES.</i>

22:02.955 --> 22:04.621
JESSIE HOLMES: I WANNA
USE THIS SLED FOR WORK,

22:04.723 --> 22:07.691
BUT I ALSO WANNA USE
IT FOR A TRAVELING SLED.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.561
THAT'S THE, HONESTLY,
THAT'S THE MAIN PURPOSE TO

22:11.263 --> 22:15.632
ME THAT I SEE FOR THIS
SLED IS A MULTIUSE SLED.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.835
IT'S GONNA BE A
VERY LIGHT SLED,

22:17.937 --> 22:22.306
WHICH IS GONNA BE PRETTY COOL
FOR HOOKING 16, 20 DOGS UP TO.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.976
WELL, IT'S
LOOKING LIKE A SLED,

22:26.078 --> 22:27.678
BUT IT'S STILL
A LONG PROCESS AWAY.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.246
JUST 'CAUSE I GOT
THIS ALL CLAMPED DOWN,

22:29.348 --> 22:31.682
I STILL GOT A LOT
OF FIGURING TO DO.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.352
THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA
LOCK THE FRONT OF MY SLED

22:35.454 --> 22:37.754
TOGETHER TO WHERE
IT CAN'T COME APART.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.656
THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE HARDEST PART,

22:39.758 --> 22:42.292
'CAUSE YOU GOTTA
KEEP EVERYTHING EXACT.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.229
THINK I'M RUNNING A
LITTLE BIT LATE FINDING WHAT

22:45.331 --> 22:47.831
I WANTED TO
DO WITH MY LIFE.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.668
AND NOW THAT I'VE
FOUND WHAT I WANNA DO,

22:51.770 --> 22:53.303
I FEEL A
LITTLE BIT BEHIND.

22:53.405 --> 22:56.139
I FEEL LIKE I GOTTA
MAXIMIZE ON MY YOUTH.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.844
I'M 34 YEARS OLD AND I'M
KIND OF IN MY PRIME RIGHT NOW.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.947
SO, I REALLY
CAN'T WASTE TIME.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.351
OKAY, TIME TO
BRING THE WILLOWS IN.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.753
IT'S GONNA TIE IN THE
TOP STANCHIONS ALL TOGETHER.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.855
WE CALL IT A STRINGER.

23:17.162 --> 23:19.429
I GOTTA STAY WARM, I
GOTTA KEEP HOT WATER ON

23:19.531 --> 23:21.598
FOR ME AND THE DOGS
ON THE STOVE CONSTANTLY.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.735
GETTING THIS SLED DONE, SO I
CAN HAUL FIREWOOD IS CRITICAL.

23:25.771 --> 23:28.639
ALL RIGHT, ALL THE MAJOR
WORK IS DONE ON THE SLED.

23:36.048 --> 23:40.150
IT'S TIME FOR THIS SLED TO SEE
THE SNOW FOR THE FIRST TIME.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.693
THERE'S A FEW THINGS I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ROB OFF MY RACING SLED,

23:49.795 --> 23:52.930
WHICH LUCKLILY HAS THE SAME
STYLE OF ALUMINUM RUNNERS.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.265
I FORGOT TO GET
FOOTPADS FOR IT.

23:55.367 --> 23:58.602
AT LEAST WITH THE HYBRID,
IT CAN WORK JUST AS GOOD FOR

23:58.704 --> 24:01.038
TRAINING THE RACE
DOGS AS I COULD WITH THIS,

24:01.140 --> 24:03.473
AND I CAN HAUL MORE, SO.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.348
WITH COLD COMES ALL
KINDS OF CHALLENGES.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.083
CAN'T DEAL
WITH THE COLD,

24:13.185 --> 24:15.452
THEN YOU JUST CAN'T
DEAL WITH LIVING UP HERE.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.988
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA LIVE
IN THE CITY AND GO RIGHT FROM

24:18.090 --> 24:21.558
YOUR WARM CAR TO YOUR
WARM BUILDING, YOU KNOW?

24:22.328 --> 24:23.794
I GOT THIS.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.929
RIGHT HERE IS
SOMETHING I CAN'T STAND ON.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.231
WITH THESE WHITE BOOTS
THAT KEEP ME WARM IN THESE

24:28.334 --> 24:32.069
TEMPERATURES, THEY'LL SLIDE
RIGHT OFF AND THESE ARE WHAT'S

24:32.171 --> 24:34.838
GONNA GIVE ME THE TRACTION.

24:34.940 --> 24:37.841
WELL, I'M TRYING TO GET THE
LITTLE SLIDING NUTS OUT HERE.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.711
AND IT'S PRETTY ICED UP
IN HERE FROM GOING THROUGH

24:40.813 --> 24:47.317
OVERFLOW, (BLEEP) NOT
WORKING OUT FOR ME (BLEEP),

24:47.987 --> 24:50.721
DAMN IT, (BLEEP).

24:52.424 --> 24:54.324
ALWAYS SOMETHING,
MAN, WHEN IT'S COLD.

24:54.426 --> 24:56.927
WISH I HAD THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS AHEAD OF TIME.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.196
COULD HAVE SAVED
MYSELF SOME TIME.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.566
I GOT TO GET THIS THING
INSIDE AND GET IT THAWING OUT.

25:06.138 --> 25:09.606
EVERYTHING'S JUST A DIFFICULTY
WHENEVER IT'S 40 BELOW.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.475
LUCKILY, I GOT PLENTY
OF OTHER STUFF I CAN BE

25:11.577 --> 25:14.211
DOING ON THE SLED.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.117
GLENN VILLENEUVE: I DON'T
GET BUMMED OUT ABOUT THINGS.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.686
JUST TAKE WHAT
COMES IN LIFE.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.324
I GOT MY WATER.

25:27.426 --> 25:29.393
NOW IT'S TIME
TO GET SOME ICE.

25:32.898 --> 25:34.398
THIS IS AN ICE SAW.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.166
IT'S A NEW TOOL FOR ME.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.234
I HAVEN'T
USED IT BEFORE.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.402
I GOT TO TRY IT OUT.

25:38.504 --> 25:41.171
I'M NOT SURE
HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.508
IT'S SO COLD OUT HERE.

25:44.610 --> 25:47.210
IT'S 43 BELOW ZERO.

25:47.312 --> 25:48.812
THERE'S ALREADY
A LAYER OF ICE.

25:48.914 --> 25:51.114
IT JUST TAKES A FEW
MINUTES TO FREEZE OVER.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.684
I WANNA GET A LOT OF
ICE FROM THE LAKE HERE AND

25:54.787 --> 25:57.587
I WANNA TAKE IT UP TO A
HOLE I HAVE IN THE GROUND.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.590
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,
I DUG A REFRIGERATOR HOLE.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.392
AND THAT REFRIGERATOR
HOLE ALLOWS ME TO KEEP

26:02.494 --> 26:04.694
FOOD COOL IN
THE SUMMERTIME.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.130
IF I PUT ICE IN THE HOLE,
IT'S GONNA WORK EVEN BETTER.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.698
I SHOULD HAVE DONE
THIS JOB A WHILE AGO,

26:08.801 --> 26:12.836
BUT I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
THAT I LET IT GO AND NOW

26:12.938 --> 26:14.404
THE ICE IS
GETTING REALLY THICK.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.106
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
TOO THICK FOR ME TO CUT WITH

26:16.208 --> 26:17.207
THIS SAW OR NOT.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.142
I'LL FIND OUT.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.180
IT'S NOT EASY.

26:23.282 --> 26:24.414
THE ICE IS SO THICK.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.483
BUT IT IS SAWING.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.385
IT'S JUST TAKING
A LOT OF STRENGTH TO

26:28.487 --> 26:31.121
CUT THROUGH THIS THICK ICE.

26:31.323 --> 26:35.559
SOME PEOPLE USE A
CHAINSAW FOR A JOB LIKE THIS.

26:36.028 --> 26:39.062
BUT THEN YOU PUT ALL KINDS
OF OIL AND JUNK IN YOUR WATER

26:39.164 --> 26:41.431
THAT I DON'T WANT IN THERE.

26:42.501 --> 26:43.900
THERE.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.302
LOOK AT THAT.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.504
I CAN PUSH IT DOWN.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.940
LET ME TRY AND GET
IT INTO POSITION.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.741
COME ON.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.110
OOH, ALMOST.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.344
HERE IT COMES.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.346
YES, THERE IT IS.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.883
NOW I STILL GOT TO GET
THAT OUT OF THE WATER.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.551
WHEW.

27:02.488 --> 27:06.323
OOH, THAT'S
A BIG CHUNK.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.391
COME ON.

27:08.494 --> 27:11.161
THIS MUST WEIGH
AT LEAST 100 POUNDS.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.898
NOPE, TOO BIG.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.867
GONNA HAVE TO GET A SLING.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.704
WHOO, THAT WATER'S COLD.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.907
MAYBE IF I
GET A ROPE UNDER IT,

27:24.009 --> 27:27.077
GET IT AROUND THE BLOCK.

27:27.179 --> 27:30.514
IT'S HARD TO SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

27:30.616 --> 27:31.982
ALMOST.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.518
COME ON, THERE.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.354
COME ON,
COME ON OUT OF THERE.

27:37.456 --> 27:38.889
COME ON OUT OF THERE.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.323
YES, COME ON.

27:40.425 --> 27:42.559
OH, OH, IT'S SLIPPING.

27:43.729 --> 27:46.096
ON, COME ON OUT OF THERE.

27:46.499 --> 27:47.832
COME ON OUT OF THERE.

27:47.934 --> 27:50.801
YES, COME ON.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.304
OH, OH, IT'S SLIPPING.

27:53.406 --> 27:56.841
DAMN, LOST IT.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.342
OH, I WANT THIS BIG BLOCK.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.979
IF I CAN GET A SECOND
LOOP AROUND IT TO BALANCE IT,

28:02.081 --> 28:04.381
THEN I CAN PULL
WITH TWO HANDS,

28:04.484 --> 28:07.318
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
POP IT OUT OF THE HOLE.

28:07.420 --> 28:12.022
HMM, I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS IS GONNA WORK.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.291
LET'S SEE.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.928
IF I CAN GET A SECOND
LOOP AROUND IT TO BALANCE IT,

28:18.030 --> 28:20.364
THEN I CAN PULL
WITH TWO HANDS,

28:20.466 --> 28:23.133
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
POP IT OUT OF THE HOLE.

28:23.236 --> 28:25.002
IT'S A HUGE BLOCK OF ICE.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.338
IT'S HARD TO GET OUT,
BUT IF I DO GET IT,

28:27.440 --> 28:30.107
THINK OF HOW LONG THAT'LL
KEEP MY REFRIGERATOR COOL.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.675
THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES.

28:31.777 --> 28:34.712
FOR YEARS, I'VE LIVED
WITHOUT BIG BLOCKS OF ICE.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.981
I JUST DIDN'T
HAVE REFRIGERATED FOOD.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.350
YOU CAN LIVE ON DRY
FOOD IN THE SUMMER.

28:39.452 --> 28:41.852
BUT WITH THIS,
IT'LL BE EASIER.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.522
LIFE WILL BE A LITTLE
BIT EASIER NEXT SUMMER.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.859
I'LL HAVE A REFRIGERATOR
THAT STAYS COOL LONGER.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.861
I DON'T HAVE TO
HAVE A REFRIGERATOR.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.396
I KNOW HOW TO
LIVE WITHOUT ONE.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.965
BUT I WANT
A REFRIGERATOR.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.301
OKAY, I HAVE IT.

28:57.403 --> 29:01.005
ONE, TWO, THREE.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.641
YES, I THINK I GOT IT.

29:03.743 --> 29:07.278
ALMOST, COME ON,
DON'T FALL BACK IN THERE.

29:07.380 --> 29:08.279
I DON'T WANNA UPSET IT.

29:08.381 --> 29:09.413
IT MIGHT FALL BACK IN.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.881
I GOT TO TAKE
MY TIME AND THINK.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.751
OKAY, IT'S PARTWAY OUT.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.587
I'M GONNA JUST TAKE MY
GLOVES OFF, USE MY BARE HANDS,

29:16.689 --> 29:18.455
PUSH LIKE HELL.

29:18.558 --> 29:20.791
OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE.

29:23.029 --> 29:26.297
I GOT IT,
YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.

29:27.567 --> 29:30.000
THAT'S HUGE, WHOO.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.470
THINK OF HOW LONG
THAT'S GONNA TAKE TO MELT.

29:33.573 --> 29:35.739
WHEN I PUT THAT IN
A HOLE IN THE GROUND,

29:35.841 --> 29:38.108
THAT'S GONNA LAST
A LONG, LONG TIME.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.345
I GOT TO MOVE THIS BEFORE IT
FREEZES RIGHT IN PLACE HERE.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.848
YEAH, I GOT IT.

29:45.885 --> 29:46.717
THIS IS COOL.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.252
LOOK AT THIS.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.521
YEAH, MAYBE I'LL
TAKE UP ICE SCULPTURE.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.723
OKAY, GOT A BLOCK OF ICE.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.325
I'M GONNA MOVE IT UP
TO MY REFRIGERATOR HOLE,

29:54.427 --> 29:56.594
PUT IT IN THERE,
ADD MORE ICE TO IT,

29:56.696 --> 29:58.896
FILL IT ALL IN
GOOD AND THICK.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.332
GOSH, I MIGHT HAVE
REFRIGERATION ALL NEXT SUMMER.

30:07.707 --> 30:10.908
SUE AIKENS: YOU CAN GET BY
IN LIFE, OR YOU CAN LIVE LIFE.

30:11.711 --> 30:13.477
ONE IS JUST
SITTING ON YOUR ASS,

30:13.579 --> 30:16.246
AND THE OTHER
DENOTES GETTING OFF IT.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.754
<i>NARRATOR: IN KAVIK,</i>
<i>SUE'S SUPPLY OF DRINKING</i>

SUE AIKENS: I SEE LOTS
OF, LOTS OF FOXY TRACKS.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.108
OH, WE'VE HAD A WOLF
COME THROUGH HERE, TOO.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.011
WE GOT ACTIVITY.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.780
YOU'VE GOT FOX
GOING AROUND HERE.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.015
YOU'VE GOT ERMINE.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.316
YOU GET A CIRCLE HERE.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.152
THEY'VE SPLIT AND
GONE DIFFERENT AREAS.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.055
THAT TELLS ME I'M NOT THE
ONLY ONE THAT'S NOTICING THAT

30:58.157 --> 31:00.391
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

31:00.493 --> 31:03.027
IF YOU ARE OBSERVANT
ENOUGH, NATURE WILL LET YOU

31:03.129 --> 31:05.362
KNOW WHAT'S COMING AT YOU.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.869
THIS IS THE RIVER.

31:11.971 --> 31:15.039
AND I'M JUST
LOOKING, LOOKING.

31:15.808 --> 31:18.809
I SEE A LITTLE SPOT
HERE MAYBE I WANNA CHECK OUT.

31:19.512 --> 31:23.180
I'M GONNA GET OUT
INTO THE CHANNEL HERE,

31:23.282 --> 31:26.984
SEE IF I CAN SEE ANY
EVIDENCE OF OVERFLOW.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.152
YEP.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.154
SEE, YOU
CAN HEAR THE ICE.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.656
KIND OF A HOLLOW SOUND.

31:32.858 --> 31:35.926
DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY WATER UNDER THAT.

31:36.162 --> 31:39.530
WE ALREADY
HAVE, ICY HERE.

31:41.033 --> 31:44.668
I, THERE'S NO,
THERE'S NO WETNESS UNDER IT.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.837
SO, THERE'S NO WATER
RUNNING ON THIS SECTION.

31:46.939 --> 31:49.006
I GO OUT THIS WAY
A LITTLE FURTHER,

31:49.108 --> 31:50.340
THERE'S ANOTHER CHANNEL.

31:50.443 --> 31:52.109
I CAN CHECK
THE BACK CHANNEL.

31:52.211 --> 31:55.145
I DON'T WANNA GO
FIVE, TEN MILES FROM CAMP.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.346
THAT'S NOT THE GOAL.

31:56.449 --> 31:58.916
GETTING YOUR WATER,
GETTING A RESOURCE,

31:59.018 --> 32:01.618
WHEN I'M JUST GETTING READY
TO HEAD INTO THE WORST PART OF

32:01.721 --> 32:03.887
THE DARKEST
PART OF MY YEAR,

32:03.989 --> 32:06.457
YOU'RE A FOOL TO
MAKE IT TOO FAR AWAY.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.932
I THINK I'M TOO
LATE ON THIS ONE,

32:15.034 --> 32:17.901
DEFINITELY WATER
WAS RIGHT HERE.

32:18.003 --> 32:21.605
BUT MY SUPER,
SUPER COLD TEMPERATURES,

32:21.707 --> 32:24.742
ARE JUST CANNIBALIZING IT.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.279
I'LL GO DOWN A
LITTLE BIT FURTHER,

32:29.381 --> 32:31.048
SEE WHAT'S AROUND THIS EDGE.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.583
IF IT'S NOT
AROUND THIS BEND,

32:32.685 --> 32:35.319
IT'S NOT GONNA
BE ON THIS RIVER.

32:42.795 --> 32:43.994
THIS DOESN'T FEEL SAFE.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.096
IT'S GETTING HARDER TO
SEE, IT'S GETTING DARKER.

32:46.198 --> 32:49.099
THE DARKER SURFACE,
THE CRYSTALLINE FORMATIONS.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.837
WATER WAS HERE,
AND IT'S HOLLOW-ISH NOW.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.007
THESE ARE THE
DEEPEST CHANNELS I HAVE.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.709
IF I DON'T HAVE WATER
RUNNING UNDERNEATH THESE,

32:58.811 --> 33:01.445
I DON'T HAVE WATER
RUNNING ON THE RIVER ANYMORE.

33:02.081 --> 33:05.048
WE'RE AT THAT TWO-MILE
POINT FROM WHERE WE STARTED.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.950
I'M NOT FINDING
ANY RUNNING WATER.

33:07.052 --> 33:09.153
I NEED TO PUT UP
SOME KIND OF FENCING,

33:09.255 --> 33:11.889
OR LOOK FOR AN AREA
THAT'S GONNA HAVE GOOD DRIFTING

33:11.991 --> 33:13.957
BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA
BE KEY FOR ME TO GET GOOD,

33:14.059 --> 33:15.692
SAFE DRINKING WATER.

33:15.795 --> 33:17.795
IT IS GETTING DARKER.

33:17.897 --> 33:19.897
I THINK THE ONLY THING
THAT I CAN DO IS GET BACK

33:19.999 --> 33:23.534
TO LITTLE RED, PUT MY
STUFF AWAY, GET HOME, REGROUP,

33:23.936 --> 33:26.804
AND GET THE
DRIFT FENCING DONE.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.710
ANDY BASSICH: WE
LIVE SEASON-TO-SEASON.

33:33.813 --> 33:35.412
WE DON'T LIVE
DAY-TO-DAY, OR WEEK-TO-WEEK.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.215
WE LIVE BY THE SEASONS.

33:39.919 --> 33:42.419
COME HERE, KRUG.

33:46.826 --> 33:49.092
I'D SAY ON A SCALE OF
ONE TO TEN, THIS WAS,

33:49.195 --> 33:53.831
TEN BEING A VERY COMFORTABLE
NIGHT AND ZERO BEING A VERY

33:53.933 --> 33:56.066
UNCOMFORTABLE NIGHT,
THIS WAS ABOUT A FOUR.

33:56.969 --> 33:59.002
<i>NARRATOR: AFTER SETTING TRAPS</i>

34:05.377 --> 34:07.344
ANDY BASSICH: I KNOW I CAME
IN FROM OVER HERE SO I GOT TO

34:07.446 --> 34:09.079
MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION.

34:09.181 --> 34:12.015
OH, ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE OVER MY BED?

34:12.484 --> 34:13.817
SHE SAYS, "HOW COME YOU
DIDN'T MAKE ONE OF THESE

34:13.919 --> 34:16.386
FOR ME LAST NIGHT?"

34:19.658 --> 34:22.459
OH, GOT A SQUIRREL.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.361
WELL, YOU CAN'T
CATCH MARTEN IF YOU GOT A

34:24.463 --> 34:26.029
SQUIRREL IN THE TRAP.

34:26.131 --> 34:27.564
SOMETIMES, WHEN
YOU'RE TRAPPING MARTEN,

34:27.666 --> 34:29.566
YOU'RE IN THE SAME
COUNTRY THE SQUIRRELS ARE IN.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.669
THE SQUIRRELS GET
INTO THE TRAPS, SO, YOU KNOW,

34:32.771 --> 34:36.306
I CAN SKIN THIS GUY OUT, AND
IF I GET ABOUT 30,000 OF THEM,

34:36.408 --> 34:39.810
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
MAKE SOMETHING WITH IT.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.649
JUST GOT TO KEEP
TRYING THINGS OUT HERE.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.117
THAT'S JUST THE
WAY THE LIFE IS.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.853
YOU JUST COME UP WITH
A PLAN, MAKE IT HAPPEN,

34:49.955 --> 34:51.355
AND THEN ADAPT.

34:51.457 --> 34:53.991
THE ONLY BAD MISTAKE OR
FAILURE IS ONE THAT KILLS YOU.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.525
ALL THE OTHER
ONES ARE GOOD BECAUSE

34:55.628 --> 34:58.095
THEY TEACH YOU SOMETHING.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.631
WELL, I'M UP ON
THE HILLSIDE HERE,

35:00.733 --> 35:03.233
AND THERE'S A SET OF MARTEN
TRACKS COMING UP THE HILL.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.635
THERE ARE MARTEN
IN THE COUNTRY,

35:04.737 --> 35:07.537
THEY'RE JUST
NOT IN MY TRAP.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.807
WHAT WE GOT, TOOP?

35:10.910 --> 35:11.808
WE GOT SOMETHING?

35:11.911 --> 35:14.111
OH, SHOOT,
ANOTHER SQUIRREL.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.980
WE WANT MARTENS.

35:17.316 --> 35:20.250
THAT JUST CLOGS YOUR TRAP
UP WHEN YOU CATCH THESE GUYS.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.653
THAT'S NO GOOD.

35:22.988 --> 35:25.155
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
GET GOING, BOYS.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.523
YEAH, I
REMEMBER THIS TREE.

35:26.625 --> 35:30.093
I'M GETTING CLOSE
TO MY LAST TRAP NOW.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.663
I GUESS I'M AT MY LAST
CHANCE TO PICK SOMETHING UP,

35:32.765 --> 35:34.264
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.133
COME ON, BOYS.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.268
OH, YOU'RE SEEING
SQUIRREL TRACKS, HUH?

35:38.370 --> 35:40.404
LOOKS LIKE A BUST.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.538
BIG GOOSE EGG.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.673
NO MARTEN.

35:42.775 --> 35:44.308
SOME SQUIRRELS.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.510
SO A LOT OF WORK,
A COLD NIGHT OUT,

35:46.612 --> 35:49.913
NOT VERY PRODUCTIVE FOR
THE EFFORT I PUT INTO IT,

35:50.015 --> 35:52.149
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.383
IT'S STILL EARLY.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.019
IT'S ONE CHECK OUT
OF HOPEFULLY MANY.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.021
IT'S ABOUT 30
BELOW ZERO OUT.

35:58.123 --> 36:00.123
ANIMALS DON'T MOVE MUCH
WHEN IT STARTS GETTING 30,

36:00.225 --> 36:03.527
40 BELOW ZERO, SO I'M
HOPING THAT WE GET A LITTLE

36:03.629 --> 36:06.263
WARM SPELL, THE ANIMALS WILL
COME OUT OF THAT COLD SPELL,

36:06.365 --> 36:08.832
WANNA EAT, AND
IT'LL BE HUNGRY,

36:09.268 --> 36:11.568
AND I'M HOPING IT'LL
START TO PRODUCE WHEN IT

36:11.670 --> 36:14.171
WARMS UP A LITTLE BIT.

36:16.642 --> 36:17.774
HAW, HAW.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.376
KRUGGER AND, HAW.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.345
KRUG, HAW.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.879
ATTABOYS.

36:22.982 --> 36:24.381
THAT'S THE WAY
IT GOES UP HERE.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.383
SOMETIMES YOU PUT
A LOT OF WORK,

36:26.485 --> 36:28.185
A LOT OF EFFORT INTO SOMETHING
AND IT DOESN'T PAY OFF.

36:28.287 --> 36:31.722
IF NOTHING ELSE, I KNOW
THAT I'VE GOT A LINE UP HERE,

36:31.824 --> 36:34.358
AND LOOKS LIKE THIS TIME I'M
GONNA HAVE TO BE PATIENT FOR

36:34.460 --> 36:36.360
THIS TO PAY OFF.

36:36.595 --> 36:37.694
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.897
LIVING OUT HERE, YOU JUST
ACCEPT WHAT COMES YOUR WAY AND

36:41.000 --> 36:44.501
DO THE BEST YOU CAN TO
KEEP ON PLUGGING THROUGH IT.

36:48.273 --> 36:49.973
JESSIE HOLMES: OUT HERE,
I'M WORKING FOR MYSELF,

36:50.075 --> 36:51.041
NOT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

36:51.143 --> 36:53.243
I'M WORKING
TOWARDS MY OWN GOALS.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.050
TIME TO SEE IF
HE'S THAWED OUT GOOD.

37:00.152 --> 37:01.251
SHOULD HAVE.

37:01.353 --> 37:04.354
IT'S BEEN NICE
AND WARM IN THE CABIN.

37:04.456 --> 37:07.257
LOOKS LIKE IT THAWED OUT.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.658
THERE YOU GO.

37:08.761 --> 37:11.561
THESE ARE THE LAST PARTS I
NEED TO ATTACH MY FOOTPADS,

37:11.663 --> 37:14.564
AND I GOT
SOMETHING TO STAND ON.

37:17.136 --> 37:19.002
<i>NARRATOR: JESSIE IS IN THE</i>
<i>FINAL STAGES OF BUILDING A</i>

37:19.104 --> 37:23.373
<i>HYBRID SLED, A CRUCIAL</i>
<i>TOOL TO HAUL RESOURCES AND</i>

37:23.475 --> 37:26.676
<i>TRAIN HIS DOGS DURING WINTER.</i>

37:29.448 --> 37:32.082
JESSIE HOLMES: GOT MY FOOTPADS
ON, EVERYTHING'S READY TO GO.

37:32.184 --> 37:33.950
JUST GOT TO GET
THE CHAINSAW LOADED UP,

37:34.053 --> 37:37.287
AND HITCH THE DOGS UP,
AND HEAD OUT TO THE WOOD YARD.

37:37.389 --> 37:40.557
ALL RIGHT BOYS,
ALL RIGHT, FLASH.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.192
I GET TO PUT THIS
NEW SLED TO WORK.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.528
REALLY EXCITED TO
SEE HOW IT'S GONNA GO.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.030
LOOKS GREAT, BUT YOU CAN'T
TELL WHAT A SLED'S GONNA DO

37:47.132 --> 37:49.032
UNTIL IT'S OUT
THERE ON THE TRAIL.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.637
ALL RIGHT, HIKE.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.239
STRAIGHT AHEAD,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.341
ALL RIGHT, WHOA, WHOA.

37:58.444 --> 38:01.311
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT UP,
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT AHEAD,

38:01.547 --> 38:03.547
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

38:05.084 --> 38:06.383
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.784
HOP, HOP, HOP.

38:07.886 --> 38:11.721
EASY, OH, WHOA.

38:12.925 --> 38:17.027
JESSIE HOLMES:
EASY, OH, WHOA.

38:17.930 --> 38:20.931
STOP, STAY.

38:21.567 --> 38:25.001
WELL, THIS
SLED'S A NICE RIDE.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.004
IT HANDLES REALLY
GOOD, IT STEERS GOOD.

38:28.106 --> 38:31.741
I'M JUST GONNA SEE IF IT
CAN HANDLE THE HEAVY WORKLOAD.

38:32.444 --> 38:35.178
CAN'T REALLY GET THE DOGS
ANCHORED OFF TO ANYTHING,

38:35.280 --> 38:39.182
SO I JUST DECIDED TO STOP
AND TURN THEM ALL LOOSE AND

38:39.284 --> 38:40.951
LET THEM HANG OUT
WHILE I CUT WOOD.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.986
LUCKILY, THEY'RE
REALLY WELL-TRAINED DOGS,

38:43.088 --> 38:44.888
AND THAT'S WHERE THE
WORK YOU PUT INTO YOUR TEAM

38:44.990 --> 38:46.823
PAYS OFF RIGHT THERE.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.292
NOW TIME TO GET
UP THE BANK HERE AND

38:49.394 --> 38:51.928
CUT A BUNCH OF
WOOD TO PUT IN IT.

38:58.303 --> 39:01.171
WITH THE FIREWOOD,
IT'S A NEVER-ENDING THING.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.543
GETTING THIS WOOD,
I'M GONNA WARM UP.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.545
TAKING IT HOME, I'M
GONNA WARM UP, SPLITTING IT,

39:08.647 --> 39:11.715
AND THEN IT'S GONNA WARM ME
UP WITH A GOOD WARM MEAL OFF MY

39:11.817 --> 39:14.084
WOODSTOVE AND KEEP
MY CABIN NICE AND WARM.

39:16.288 --> 39:19.389
THIS AIN'T A LIFESTYLE
FOR WEAK PEOPLE.

39:20.993 --> 39:22.759
ALL RIGHT.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.427
OH, YEAH, I'M
ECSTATIC WITH HOW GOOD

39:24.530 --> 39:26.029
THIS SLED DID
COMING DOWN HERE.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.498
NOW I'M GONNA PUT IT TO THE
TEST WITH A BIG LOAD OF WOOD.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.267
IT'S A GOOD
COUPLE HUNDRED POUNDS.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.802
GONNA BE SOME DAMN HARD
PULLING, I CAN TELL THAT.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.171
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S
JUST ANOTHER CHALLENGE ME

39:35.274 --> 39:37.807
AND THE DOGS ARE GONNA
WORK THROUGH TOGETHER.

39:38.176 --> 39:41.211
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE EXCITED
TO DO THIS WORK FOR ME THOUGH

39:41.747 --> 39:43.346
AND THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

39:43.448 --> 39:45.482
THAT MUST MEAN THEY
LIKE THE NEW SLED.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.350
ALL RIGHT, READY?

39:47.452 --> 39:51.621
HIKE, HIKE.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.191
ALL RIGHT, READY?

39:55.294 --> 39:57.994
HIKE, HIKE.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.864
GOOD BOYS, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, HAW.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.566
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT UP,
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT AHEAD,

40:02.668 --> 40:03.667
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

40:03.769 --> 40:08.471
THERE YOU GO, ALL
RIGHT BOYS, GOOD JOB.

40:08.941 --> 40:10.674
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

40:10.776 --> 40:13.843
THESE DOGS ARE AMAZING, THEY
JUST PULLED THIS HEAVY LOAD OF

40:13.946 --> 40:18.048
WOOD THROUGH THIS TWO-FOOT
DEEP POWDER SNOW ON THIS NEW

40:18.150 --> 40:19.282
SLED THAT I BUILT.

40:19.384 --> 40:20.784
I BRED THESE DOGS.

40:20.886 --> 40:21.985
I BUILT THIS SLED.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.286
THIS IS ME.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.956
THIS IS WHAT I DO AND THIS
IS AN EXPRESSION OF WHO I AM.

40:26.058 --> 40:27.123
I'M JESSIE HOLMES.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.492
I'M THE MAN WHO
HAULS WOOD, BREEDS DOGS,

40:29.595 --> 40:31.261
AND BUILDS HIS OWN SLEDS.

40:31.363 --> 40:33.396
AND THAT'S A GOOD
MAN TO BE UP HERE.

40:33.599 --> 40:35.165
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.306
SUE AIKENS: I MAY FLOUT
A LOT OF SOCIETY'S RULES,

40:43.408 --> 40:45.609
BUT AS A SOCIETY
OF ONE I MAKE MY OWN.

40:57.022 --> 41:00.523
SO LAST NIGHT, WHEN I
WAS OUT AND ABOUT AND SKIING,

41:00.759 --> 41:03.627
I STARTED IN THE DAY,
ENDED UP WELL PAST NIGHT.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.895
I DIDN'T FIND ANY
LIQUID WATER, THEREFORE,

41:05.998 --> 41:08.365
I NEED TO GET THIS
DRIFT FENCING UP,

41:08.600 --> 41:11.935
SO I CAN START FARMING
AND COLLECTING THE SNOWDRIFTS.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.842
THIS IS DRIFT FENCING.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.844
AND THE WHOLE
POINT OF THIS IS,

41:20.946 --> 41:25.281
IMAGINE IT'S STUCK UPRIGHT,
THE WIND IS GONNA HIT THIS,

41:25.384 --> 41:28.418
ALL THESE LITTLE BAFFLES
CREATE AN AREA FOR THE SNOW

41:28.520 --> 41:32.155
THAT HITS IT, THE MILES
PER HOUR IT'S GOING SUDDENLY

41:32.257 --> 41:35.625
DECREASES TO ALMOST NIL
AND IT DROPS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.094
YOU ARE ACTUALLY
GROWING SOMETHING.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.863
YOU'RE GROWING
A DRIFT FOR WATER.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.831
THIS IS A GREAT AREA.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.433
THIS WAY OR THIS WAY,
DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAY THAT

41:43.535 --> 41:45.135
WIND'S GONNA COME,
NORTH OR SOUTH,

41:45.237 --> 41:48.138
I'M GONNA
COLLECT THE DRIFT.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.740
JUST KICKING THE
LENGTH OF THIS OUT.

41:51.643 --> 41:55.745
AND I'M GONNA BE HEADING
TOWARDS THE BRUSH OVER HERE.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.617
WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS
JUST KIND OF TACK IT ON HERE.

42:00.719 --> 42:03.186
NOT ITS PERMANENT HOME,
BUT FOR THE TIME-BEING,

42:03.288 --> 42:06.523
I JUST NEED TO GET
IT ATTACHED SOMEWHERE.

42:06.758 --> 42:09.092
THERE WE GO.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.195
I'M NOT FOOLING
MYSELF THAT I AM TAMING

42:12.297 --> 42:14.230
MOTHER NATURE, NO WAY.

42:14.466 --> 42:17.834
WHAT I'M TRYING TO
DO IS UTILIZE SOMETHING

42:17.936 --> 42:19.536
THAT HAPPENS NATURALLY.

42:19.638 --> 42:23.540
THE WIND, THE SNOW, THE COLD,
ALL HAPPENS NATURALLY HERE AND

42:23.642 --> 42:25.642
I'M JUST GIVING
IT A PLACE AND MAKING IT

42:25.744 --> 42:27.143
CONVENIENT FOR MYSELF.

42:27.245 --> 42:30.580
I'M APPLYING YOU KNOW,
SCIENCE, KNOWLEDGE, AND HABIT.

42:30.816 --> 42:31.848
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

42:31.950 --> 42:33.450
HAVEN'T HAD TO
DO IT FOR YEARS,

42:33.552 --> 42:37.554
BUT WHY NOT USE WHAT
MOTHER NATURE LAYS OUT THERE?

42:43.762 --> 42:45.261
MAKE IT A LITTLE TIGHTER.

42:45.363 --> 42:50.533
ALL RIGHT, I'M
PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT.

42:51.136 --> 42:54.671
I'VE NOW GOT A LONG STRETCH
THAT IS GOING TO EITHER SIDE,

42:54.773 --> 42:58.141
BECOME A DRIFT TWO,
THREE TIMES THE FENCE.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.643
I'VE TURNED IT INTO A
VIABLE OPTION FOR WATER FOR

43:00.746 --> 43:02.011
THE REST OF THE WINTER.

43:02.114 --> 43:04.013
NO MATTER HOW THE
REST OF THE WINTER GOES,

43:04.116 --> 43:07.016
I'M GONNA BE USING MOTHER
NATURE ITSELF TO CREATE THE

43:07.119 --> 43:09.652
WATER SOURCE I NEED.

43:10.789 --> 43:13.156
THIS IS THE
STUFF THAT I CAME FOR.

43:13.258 --> 43:16.659
THE OBSTACLES, THE
HARDSHIPS, THE CHALLENGES.

43:16.762 --> 43:19.195
YOU TAKE WHAT LIFE THROWS
AT YOU AND YOU WORK WITH IT.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.998
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
WORK HARDER AND CHANGE IT.

43:26.238 --> 43:27.871
GLENN VILLENEUVE: I DON'T
GET BUMMED OUT ABOUT THINGS.

43:27.973 --> 43:31.307
I JUST TAKE
WHAT COMES IN LIFE.

43:37.649 --> 43:40.216
RIGHT HERE, THIS IS
WHERE MY REFRIGERATOR HOLE IS.

43:40.318 --> 43:43.319
SO, I JUST
GOT TO DIG IT OUT.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.027
THERE, I GOT IT.

43:51.463 --> 43:54.397
YEAH, LOOK IT, I GOT IT.

43:56.701 --> 43:59.335
THIS IS MY REFRIGERATOR
HOLE RIGHT HERE.

43:59.437 --> 44:02.105
THE FOOD GOES
IN THIS BARREL.

44:02.207 --> 44:05.408
THAT PROTECTS IT FROM
RODENTS AND SCAVENGERS.

44:05.510 --> 44:08.378
THERE'S SOME SPACE.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.713
I DON'T KNOW IF MY
BLOCK WILL FIT, THOUGH.

44:10.816 --> 44:12.081
I THINK IT'S
A LITTLE TOO BIG.

44:12.184 --> 44:15.285
BUT AROUND THE BARREL,
IF I CAN FILL IT IN WITH ICE,

44:15.387 --> 44:17.620
THINK OF THE COOLING POWER.

44:17.722 --> 44:20.523
THAT BIG BLOCK OF
ICE DOWN IN THERE,

44:20.625 --> 44:22.192
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIG.

44:22.294 --> 44:25.261
I'LL HAVE TO SHAVE
IT TO FIT, I THINK.

44:25.363 --> 44:28.198
AND IF I CAN PUT ONE BIG
CHUNK HERE BEHIND THE BARREL,

44:28.300 --> 44:29.599
THAT'LL LAST SO MUCH LONGER.

44:29.701 --> 44:31.534
I'LL TRY TO PUT THE
BIGGEST CHUNK I CAN BACK

44:31.636 --> 44:32.802
HERE BEHIND THE BARREL.

44:32.904 --> 44:34.804
AND THEN SMALLER PIECES TO
FILL IN THE SPACES AND THEN

44:34.906 --> 44:39.676
I'LL PROBABLY POUR
WATER IN THERE, TOO.

44:39.945 --> 44:41.444
THIS SAW WORKS REALLY WELL.

44:41.546 --> 44:43.813
I SHOULD HAVE GOT
ONE OF THESE YEARS AGO.

44:44.482 --> 44:46.950
I WANNA BE ABLE TO SHAPE IT TO
FIT IN THERE MORE EFFICIENTLY.

44:47.052 --> 44:49.252
I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT
THAT RIGHT IN THE BACK.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.588
FILL UP A LOT OF
SPACE WITH ONE BIG CHUNK,

44:51.690 --> 44:53.656
AND THEN FILL
IN ALL AROUND IT.

44:53.758 --> 44:55.425
THERE.

44:55.527 --> 44:57.794
OH, IF I COULD JUST GET
IT IN BESIDE THE BARREL.

44:57.896 --> 44:59.529
IT'S HEAVY.

44:59.631 --> 45:01.531
HERE IT GOES,
HERE IT GOES.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.467
WHOA, YEAH, THIS IS NICE.

45:05.303 --> 45:07.937
I CAN FILL IN THE
SPACES AROUND IT.

45:08.039 --> 45:09.272
I GOT A REFRIGERATOR,

45:09.374 --> 45:11.908
TOO, THAT'S GONNA
LAST ALL NEXT SUMMER.

45:12.177 --> 45:14.911
I'M JUST FILLING
IN THE HOLES NOW.

45:16.081 --> 45:19.382
OKAY, I GOT THE
ICE IN THERE FIRST,

45:19.584 --> 45:22.952
NOW I'M FILLING
IN THE SPACES WITH SNOW.

45:23.889 --> 45:27.423
AND THEN I THINK
I'LL POUR WATER IN,

45:27.626 --> 45:28.958
AND THAT
WATER WILL FREEZE.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.728
IT'S 40 BELOW ZERO, SO
THE WATER WILL FREEZE UP

45:31.830 --> 45:34.163
AND IT'LL JUST
BE SOLID ICE IN THERE.

45:35.700 --> 45:37.500
GOT MY REFRIGERATOR
ALL FIXED UP.

45:37.602 --> 45:39.502
THIS IS GONNA BE
ONE GIANT MASS OF ICE.

45:39.604 --> 45:40.904
WHEN NEXT SUMMER COMES,

45:41.006 --> 45:43.573
THIS IS GONNA HELP
ME STORE FOOD A LOT LONGER.

45:43.808 --> 45:46.809
I GOT MY JOBS ALL DONE,
AND IT'S STILL EARLY ENOUGH.

45:46.912 --> 45:48.278
I CAN GO FIND A
GOOD PLACE TO WATCH THE

45:48.380 --> 45:50.546
SUPERMOON RISE TONIGHT.

45:50.649 --> 45:52.649
IT'S GONNA BE MANY YEARS
UNTIL THE MOON'S AS BIG AND

45:52.751 --> 45:54.684
AS BRIGHT AS IT'S
GOING TO BE TONIGHT.

45:54.786 --> 45:57.687
WHEN THAT MOON COMES UP,
IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING.

45:59.758 --> 46:03.226
I'M GONNA CLIMB UP ON THE
CACHE AND GET A GOOD VIEW.

46:03.328 --> 46:09.065
THERE IT IS.

46:18.843 --> 46:21.277
IT'S A LITTLE CLOSER TO
THE EARTH THAN THE FULL MOON

46:21.379 --> 46:24.414
USUALLY IS, SO IT'S BRIGHTER,
AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT BIGGER.

46:24.516 --> 46:28.584
IT CAN BE 14% BIGGER AND 30%
BRIGHTER THAN AT OTHER TIMES.

46:29.354 --> 46:31.487
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR,
IT'S THE DEEPEST,

46:31.589 --> 46:33.356
DARKEST PART OF WINTER.

46:33.458 --> 46:36.359
I CAN'T SEE THE SUN ANYMORE,
BUT I CAN STILL SEE SUNLIGHT

46:36.795 --> 46:40.096
REFLECTED OFF THAT MOON.

46:41.700 --> 46:44.634
IT'S SO QUIET OUT HERE.

46:44.736 --> 46:49.605
IF YOU JUST WANNA THINK,
YOU JUST WANNA MEDITATE,

46:49.874 --> 46:52.909
YOU JUST WANNA TAKE SOME
TIME ALONE AND SPEND SOME TIME

46:53.011 --> 46:56.279
IN PEACE AND QUIET, THERE'S
NOTHING LIKE IT OUT HERE.
