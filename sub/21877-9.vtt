WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:04.470
WHEN WE MOVED IN HERE,
HIS BEHAVIOR CHANGED.

00:04.471 --> 00:09.240
THIS BIG, TALL,
BLACK MASS JUST SHOWED UP.

00:09.242 --> 00:12.678
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.780
THAT DEFINITELY
GOT TOUCHED.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.549
SOMETHING TOUCHED THOSE.
- RIGHT.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.052
WOULD YOU SLEEP
IN YOUR ROOM AGAIN, EVER?

00:20.054 --> 00:21.186
NEVER.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.521
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.224
DID IT JUST SAY "DEAD"?

00:26.226 --> 00:27.726
THAT'S JUST THE START.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.461
THAT'S JUST THE START.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.636
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.305
I WAS ONLY 8
WHEN A PARANORMAL INCIDENT

00:40.307 --> 00:41.907
CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.410
SINCE THEN,
I'VE DEDICATED MY TIME

00:45.412 --> 00:49.213
TO SOLVING THE MOST TERRIFYING
HAUNTINGS IMAGINABLE.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.682
I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.251
MORE THAN A DECADE AGO,
AN ENCOUNTER AT GETTYSBURG

00:53.253 --> 00:55.620
ROCKED MY BELIEFS
ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.722
TOGETHER,
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH

00:57.724 --> 00:59.357
BEHIND
THE UNEXPLAINABLE.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.993
MY GOD.

01:00.995 --> 01:04.196
NOW WE ARE ON
OUR MOST IMPORTANT MISSION YET.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.100
HELPING FAMILIES
OVERCOME THEIR FEAR,

01:08.102 --> 01:12.471
TAKE BACK THEIR HOMES,
AND RECLAIM THEIR LIVES.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.612
- HEY.
- Hey.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.315
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
ABOUT A CASE

01:23.317 --> 01:25.250
THAT I JUST GOT IN AN E-MAIL.
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

01:25.252 --> 01:27.286
- Yeah, totally.
- OKAY.

01:27.288 --> 01:31.089
SO A WOMAN NAMED TAMMY,
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE

01:31.091 --> 01:32.924
WITH HER DAUGHTER,
MICHELLE,

01:32.926 --> 01:34.860
AND MICHELLE'S SON, TYLER,

01:34.862 --> 01:36.461
WHO'S 6 YEARS OLD,

01:36.463 --> 01:40.966
ALL OF THEM HAVE SEEN WHAT
APPEARED TO BE A SHADOW MAN.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.134
There's been growling
in the house.

01:43.136 --> 01:44.635
There have been footsteps.

01:44.637 --> 01:46.872
I MEAN, IT'S COMING TO THE POINT
WHERE TYLER, THE 6-YEAR-OLD,

01:46.874 --> 01:50.175
DOESN'T EVEN SLEEP
IN HIS ROOM AT ALL.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.543
REALLY, AT THIS POINT,

01:51.545 --> 01:54.846
I'M TERRIFIED FOR THE KID,
IN ALL HONESTY,

01:54.848 --> 01:56.114
'CAUSE THEY ARE
EXPERIENCING SOMETHING

01:56.116 --> 01:57.416
THEY CAN NOT EXPLAIN.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.683
Let's take care of this.

01:58.685 --> 02:01.919
I HATE TO HEAR ABOUT
A 6-YEAR-OLD HAVING ISSUES.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.723
JUST SHOOT ME THE ADDRESS,
AND I WILL MEET YOU THERE.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.158
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.662
THE BIGGEST CONCERN WITH
THIS FAMILY HAS TO BE TYLER.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.164
TYLER IS A 6-YEAR-OLD BOY,

02:12.166 --> 02:15.667
AND THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT
SLEEPING IS ACTUALLY UNSETTLING,

02:15.669 --> 02:17.802
SO WHATEVER'S HAPPENING
IN THIS HOUSE

02:17.804 --> 02:20.171
NEEDS TO BE FIGURED OUT
VERY, VERY QUICKLY.

02:20.173 --> 02:23.542
TAMMY, THANK YOU
FOR INVITING US INTO YOUR HOME.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.244
- THANK YOU.
- SO WHO ALL IS HERE?

02:26.246 --> 02:27.478
YOUR DAUGHTER...
- YES, AND --

02:27.480 --> 02:28.646
- ...AND HER SON.
- YES.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.949
CAN YOU JUST KIND OF
GIVE US AN OVERVIEW

02:30.951 --> 02:32.818
OF WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE HOUSE?

02:32.820 --> 02:35.353
I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.

02:35.355 --> 02:40.992
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS BIG, TALL,
BLACK MASS JUST SHOWED UP...

02:40.994 --> 02:41.927
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.162
OKAY.

02:44.164 --> 02:48.133
...STARTED TERRORIZING
MY GRANDSON,

02:48.135 --> 02:50.969
AND HE WOULDN'T SLEEP
IN HIS ROOM ANYMORE.

02:50.971 --> 02:55.273
HE WOULDN'T SLEEP AT ALL 'CAUSE
THIS THING KEPT SCARING HIM.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.142
LIKE, A SHADOW MAN,
OR, LIKE,

02:57.144 --> 02:58.977
AN ACTUAL, LIKE -- OKAY.
- A BLACK SHADOW, YEAH.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.146
I GOT THIS HOUSE FOR A STEAL...
- REALLY?

03:01.148 --> 03:05.283
...I MEAN, A STEAL,
AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S WHY.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.586
WHEN YOU SEE THIS SHADOW,

03:07.588 --> 03:10.622
DOES IT FEEL LIKE
A FAMILIAR PRESENCE TO YOU?

03:10.624 --> 03:12.757
- NO, NOT SOMEBODY I KNOW...
- OKAY.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.359
...BUT YOU CAN TELL
IT'S A MAN.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.694
- RIGHT.
- IT'S COLD.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.129
COLD, LIKE DISTANT?

03:18.131 --> 03:19.864
- YES. YEAH.
- OKAY.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.732
SO TYLER AND YOU SEE IT.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.734
DOES ANYBODY ELSE SEE IT?

03:23.736 --> 03:25.737
MY DAUGHTER, MICHELLE.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.672
I'VE SEEN IT
IN MY ROOM UPSTAIRS,

03:27.674 --> 03:29.040
AND IT'S JUST, LIKE,
AN OUTLINE.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.211
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING, LIKE, DEFINITE OF HIM,

03:32.213 --> 03:34.345
AND IT'S JUST KIND
OF PRETTY CREEPY.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.580
OKAY.

03:35.582 --> 03:39.851
SO WHEN YOU SEE IT UPSTAIRS,
IS TYLER IN HIS ROOM?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.953
NOT USUALLY.
HE SLEEPS WITH MY MOTHER.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.821
WHY DOESN'T HE COME TO YOU?

03:43.823 --> 03:45.424
'CAUSE I'M UPSTAIRS.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.791
- AND THAT'S WHERE --
- YEAH.

03:46.793 --> 03:50.629
THAT'S WHERE HE HEARS THINGS
AND HAS SEEN THE SHADOW.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.530
DO YOU THINK TYLER
IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED

03:52.532 --> 03:54.165
BY THE ACTIVITY
THAT'S HAPPENING?

03:54.167 --> 03:55.634
SOMETIMES I WONDER.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.735
I RECENTLY HAD HIM
INTO THE DOCTORS,

03:57.737 --> 04:00.538
AND WE'RE ONLY ON OUR
LIKE FOURTH OR FIFTH VISIT,

04:00.540 --> 04:02.340
SO WE'RE IN THE MIDST
OF ALL THAT RIGHT NOW.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.376
- OKAY.
- SO THAT'S WHERE IT ALL STARTED.

04:05.378 --> 04:08.045
THAT'S JUST THE START.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.514
THAT'S JUST THE START.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.449
OKAY.

04:11.451 --> 04:16.387
ONCE, THE MASS WAS JUST
OUTSIDE MY BEDROOM DOOR.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.992
SO SHOW US
WHERE THE SHADOW WAS.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.858
I HAVE A NIGHT-LIGHT,
IF YOU'LL NOTICE.

04:21.861 --> 04:26.698
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE NIGHT-LIGHT
JUST BLACKED OUT,

04:26.700 --> 04:29.534
AND THEN IT BLINKED
BACK ON AGAIN.

04:29.536 --> 04:34.605
I COULD SEE IT FROM MY BED, AND
IT WAS STANDING, WATCHING ME.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.375
THAT'S TERRIFYING.

04:37.377 --> 04:41.679
YEAH, AND THEN
IT WAS JUST GONE.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.282
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, IS THERE ANYTHING UPSTAIRS?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.550
YES.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.956
MY DAUGHTER
MICHELLE'S ROOM,

04:50.958 --> 04:53.058
MICHELLE HAD IT
KNOCKING ON THE WINDOW.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.661
MICHELLE HAS BEEN GROWLED AT.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.596
DID IT SOUND MUFFLED OR --

04:58.598 --> 05:02.134
DON'T KNOW. ASK HER.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.469
LITERALLY, ALL I DID
WAS OPEN MY CLOSET DOOR,

05:04.471 --> 05:06.571
AND YET I HEARD
THE

05:06.573 --> 05:10.208
LIKE, AND I HAD NEVER RAN
AND SCREAMED SO FAST.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.243
IT WAS MORE LIKE
A BREATH, LIKE...

05:12.245 --> 05:14.813
YEAH, LIKE
LIKE.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.647
THE TAPPING,
THE KNOCKING THAT YOU HEAR,

05:16.649 --> 05:18.550
IS IT TAPPING, LIKE, TA-TA-TA
ON THE WINDOW?

05:18.552 --> 05:20.318
- NO, IT'S A FULL-ON KNOCK.
- IT IS A FULL, LIKE, SOMEBODY --

05:20.320 --> 05:23.187
IT'S KNOCK, KNOCK,
KNOCK, KNOCK.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.456
TYLER'S ROOM --

05:24.458 --> 05:27.359
HE CLAIMED THAT SOMEBODY
WAS KNOCKING ON THE WINDOW.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.560
SO THEY BOTH HAD KNOCKING
ON THESE WINDOWS.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.295
AND THESE ARE ON THE SECOND
FLOOR, OBVIOUSLY, SO --

05:31.297 --> 05:32.364
YES, THE SECOND FLOOR.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.766
NOBODY SHOULD BE
KNOCKING ON WINDOWS.

05:35.768 --> 05:40.238
THE ONE THING WITH TYLER IS,
WHEN WE MOVED IN HERE,

05:40.240 --> 05:42.974
HIS BEHAVIOR CHANGED
ALSO.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.109
HOW SO?
WHAT KIND OF KID IS HE?

05:45.111 --> 05:48.713
HE WAS THE SWEETEST LITTLE BOY,
AND THEN BOOM,

05:48.715 --> 05:50.215
HE CHANGED AN AWFUL LOT.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.750
WITH NOT SLEEPING,
OF COURSE,

05:51.752 --> 05:54.519
THAT'S GOING TO
AFFECT HIS EMOTIONS.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.288
I MEAN, A LITTLE KID
CAN'T STAY UP FOR THREE DAYS,

05:57.290 --> 05:59.925
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
IT WAS SO BAD FOR HIM.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.930
WHO DO YOU THINK
IT MIGHT BE?

06:04.932 --> 06:07.832
I'M REALLY NOT SURE.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.101
I MEAN, THE ONLY ONE,
REALLY, THAT'S PASSED

06:10.103 --> 06:12.236
THAT IS CLOSE TO ME
IS MY FATHER. SO..

06:12.238 --> 06:14.939
OKAY, OKAY.
AND WHEN DID HE PASS AWAY?

06:14.941 --> 06:16.007
FOUR YEARS AGO.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.143
WHAT WAS THAT
RELATIONSHIP LIKE?

06:18.145 --> 06:19.110
I LOVED HIM.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.012
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

06:21.014 --> 06:27.852
HE WAS A TYPICAL HARLEY GUY
TO THE DAY HE DIED, REALLY.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.687
AND OBVIOUSLY, IF IT'S
SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW...

06:29.689 --> 06:31.189
- BYE.
- ...YOU WANT IT TO GO.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.758
- YEAH. YEAH.
- OKAY.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.260
I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE
HIM CROSS OVER THAN
STICK AROUND WITH ME.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.796
WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT
THEY CAN CROSS STUFF OVER.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.932
HOWEVER, WE'RE SORT OF,
OF THE THEORY

06:40.934 --> 06:43.334
THAT ONCE
THE ANSWERS ARE GIVEN,

06:43.336 --> 06:45.270
SOMETIMES THEY JUST
KIND OF GO ON THEIR OWN,

06:45.272 --> 06:48.373
AND USUALLY, THERE'S A REASON
WHY SOMEONE IS AROUND.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.707
YEAH.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.275
SO WHEN YOU'RE TELLING US
THIS STUFF, YOU KNOW,

06:51.277 --> 06:52.911
YOU SAY IT VERY
CONVERSATIONALLY,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.680
BUT WHEN IT'S HAPPENING,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

06:55.682 --> 06:57.982
I DON'T LIKE THAT
IT BOTHERS TYLER.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.316
- RIGHT.
- I HAVE TO SAY,

06:59.318 --> 07:02.187
THIS IS THE WHOLE REASON
WHY I STARTED LOOKING FOR HELP.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.488
SO REALLY,
WE'RE HERE FOR TYLER.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.690
- YES, YOU ARE.
- OKAY.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.058
ARE YOU SCARED
FOR TYLER?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.459
- YES.
- YES.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

07:21.207 --> 07:22.740
I'M GOING TO
SIT DOWN WITH TYLER

07:22.742 --> 07:25.577
TO FIND OUT WHY
HE IS SO SCARED OF HIS ROOM.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.480
WHILE I TALK TO HIM, I WILL BE
ABLE TO OBSERVE HIS BEHAVIOR.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.515
AS A MOM, I KNOW
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

07:30.517 --> 07:32.984
NOT TO ESCALATE
HIS FEAR LEVEL.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.453
HI. IS THIS YOUR ROOM?
- YEP.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.322
DO YOU SLEEP UP HERE?

07:38.324 --> 07:39.958
- I USED TO.
- YEAH?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.093
AND NOW I SLEEP
WITH MY NANA.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.763
HOW COME YOU SLEEP
WITH YOUR NANA?

07:44.765 --> 07:48.433
BECAUSE I'M SCARED
BECAUSE I SEE FREDDY AND --

07:48.435 --> 07:49.834
BECAUSE YOU SEE FREDDY?

07:49.836 --> 07:51.670
AND SO BUT IS THAT
WHO YOU SEE,

07:51.672 --> 07:54.839
OR DO YOU SEE A MAN
THAT YOU CALL FREDDY?

07:54.841 --> 07:57.808
YEAH.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.410
ARE YOU OKAY?

07:59.412 --> 08:02.280
OBVIOUSLY,
TYLER IS TERRIFIED.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.550
I CAN SEE THAT AT PLAY
WHEN I INTERACT WITH HIM.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.719
HE CAN'T EVEN SIT
STILL IN THIS ROOM

08:07.721 --> 08:11.622
BECAUSE HE'S JUST
SO NERVOUS AND SCARED.

08:11.624 --> 08:12.623
- AND...
- YEAH?

08:12.625 --> 08:15.993
...THIS IS REALLY CREEPY.
IT...

08:15.995 --> 08:17.729
IT KNOCKS ON YOUR WINDOW?

08:17.731 --> 08:20.331
YEAH, ALL THE TIME
WHEN I'M IN HERE.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.232
ALL THE TIME?

08:21.234 --> 08:22.600
WHEN IT'S NIGHT.

08:22.602 --> 08:25.537
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

08:25.539 --> 08:27.238
IT JUST WENT AWAY.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.973
IT JUST WENT AWAY?

08:28.975 --> 08:31.709
AND SO IS THAT WHY YOU SLEEP
WITH YOUR NANA NOW?

08:31.711 --> 08:33.645
YEAH.

08:33.647 --> 08:37.948
SO WOULD YOU SLEEP
IN YOUR ROOM AGAIN, EVER?

08:37.951 --> 08:41.018
- NEVER.
- YOU'LL NEVER SLEEP IN HERE?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.620
NO.

08:42.621 --> 08:44.322
YOU WANT US TO FIX IT?

08:44.324 --> 08:49.260
YEAH, AND THEN I CAN
SOMETIMES SLEEP IN MY ROOM.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.929
WE'LL TRY.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.030
ALL RIGHT,
YOU GO AHEAD AND HIDE IN THERE.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.765
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TYLER WENT.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.235
I'M GOING TO GET TO WORK.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.744
THERE'S THIS LITTLE 6-YEAR-OLD
BOY WHO'S CRYING AND SHAKING.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.713
HE'S THAT SCARED TO BE
IN HIS ROOM.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.882
I MEAN, IF I WAS IN THAT
SITUATION WITH MY OWN CHILD,

09:11.884 --> 09:15.420
I'D DO EVERYTHING I COULD
TO TRY TO GET IT FIXED.

09:16.956 --> 09:20.125
SO HOW DID IT GO
WITH TYLER?

09:20.127 --> 09:22.960
HE CLEARLY DESCRIBES
A SHADOW.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.395
HE DESCRIBES THE KNOCKING.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.766
I CAN'T IMAGINE A CHILD THAT AGE
SEEING STUFF LIKE THAT.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.268
SO EVERY SINGLE PERSON HERE
HAS BEEN AFFECTED

09:30.270 --> 09:31.802
BY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY,

09:31.804 --> 09:35.373
AND IT'S CONSISTENT
WITH THIS SHADOW FIGURE.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.009
SO I GUESS IT'S OUR TURN.
- YEAH.

09:38.011 --> 09:41.279
WE NEED TO SEE IF WE CAN
KIND OF FLUSH IT OUT.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.453
TYLER'S OUR PRIORITY HERE
JUST BECAUSE HE'S TERRIFIED.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.887
YOU KNOW, HE WON'T
EVEN PLAY UPSTAIRS

09:49.889 --> 09:51.923
DURING THE DAY BY HIMSELF,

09:51.925 --> 09:55.126
SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO
SPEND SOME TIME IN TYLER'S ROOM.

10:02.736 --> 10:06.204
OKAY.
- LET'S SEE IF ANYONE IS HERE.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.172
MY NAME IS ADAM,
AND THIS IS AMY.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.674
HI.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.443
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
THAT THEY'VE SEEN IN THIS HOUSE.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.613
THEY SEE YOU AS A SHADOW.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.317
WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.352
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
THIS LITTLE DEVICE HERE.

10:21.354 --> 10:25.924
IT RECORDS YOUR VOICE,
EVEN IF WE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

10:25.926 --> 10:29.794
CAN YOU JUST SAY YOUR NAME
AS LOUDLY AS YOU CAN?

10:34.367 --> 10:36.701
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

10:38.771 --> 10:41.006
DID YOU MEAN
TO SCARE TYLER?

10:43.477 --> 10:46.177
ARE YOU RELATED TO THE FAMILY
THAT'S HERE NOW?

10:48.648 --> 10:52.217
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
IF THERE'S ANYTHING HERE.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.531
DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?
- THE THUMP.

11:06.533 --> 11:07.698
YEP.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.900
YEAH, LIKE,
DOOM, DOOM.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.935
DOOM, DOOM.
OUT THERE.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.843
I WANT TO CHECK
HER CLOSET HERE.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.122
NOTHING.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.063
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY
THE SPIRIT BOX.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.165
YEAH.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.135
A SPIRIT BOX CLICKS THROUGH
THE FREQUENCIES OF A RADIO,

11:44.137 --> 11:47.538
AND WE ARE LISTENING FOR WORDS
THAT COME THROUGH THE STATIC.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.940
SO IF THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE WITH US,

11:49.942 --> 11:52.510
YOU CAN USE THIS
TO TALK TO US.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.163
SO IF THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE WITH US,

12:13.165 --> 12:15.099
YOU CAN USE THIS
TO TALK TO US.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.136
TELL ME THAT DID NOT
JUST SAY, "I'M HERE."

12:19.138 --> 12:21.505
IT SAID "HERE."
I MEAN, I'VE GOT IT RECORDED.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.578
IS THERE SOMEONE HERE?

12:32.686 --> 12:35.186
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

12:41.560 --> 12:44.028
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

12:50.503 --> 12:52.069
IT WENT QUIET.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.304
I WANT TO PLAY THAT BACK.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.506
OKAY.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.512
THAT IS SO LOUD.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.947
YEAH. "I'M HERE."

13:02.949 --> 13:04.782
THAT'S LIKE, "I'M HERE,"
RIGHT OFF THE GATES.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.318
LIKE, RIGHT OUT.
YEAH.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.187
WEIRD.

13:10.189 --> 13:13.624
IT TALKED TO US THROUGH
THE SPIRIT BOX A LITTLE BIT,

13:13.626 --> 13:16.794
SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE KIND
OF GAINING ITS TRUST, STILL.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.229
YEAH.
I'M ANXIOUS TO FIND OUT.

13:19.231 --> 13:22.466
WHO IS THIS GUY?

13:22.468 --> 13:25.269
WHAT IS THIS THING
THAT THEY'RE SEEING?

13:25.271 --> 13:27.071
I MEAN,
WE ARE GETTING ACTIVITY.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.639
JUST NONE OF IT
IS SPECIFIC.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.941
WE DON'T KNOW
WHO IT IS.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.375
WE DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY'RE TALKING TO US.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.311
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE
DIFFERENT TACTICS

13:33.313 --> 13:35.880
AND SEE IF WE CAN CONNECT
WITH WHOEVER THIS IS.

13:35.882 --> 13:38.782
LET'S THINK.
I WANT TO CATCH THE SHADOW.

13:38.784 --> 13:41.119
I MEAN, LEAVING THE DVR
UP ALL NIGHT IS KEY.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.687
WE HAVE TO.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.489
I NEED TO SIT DOWN
WITH TAMMY

13:44.491 --> 13:46.524
AND JUST TRY TO GET
MORE INFORMATION

13:46.526 --> 13:48.960
ABOUT WHO ELSE
THIS COULD BE.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.837
YEAH, IT'S IMPORTANT,
WHEN WE'RE DOING THESE CASES,

13:59.839 --> 14:02.106
THAT WE GET SOME
ONE-ON-ONE TIME WITH OUR CLIENTS

14:02.108 --> 14:04.842
AND JUST TRY TO GET MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE

14:04.844 --> 14:06.677
NEAR TO THEM WHO PASSED AWAY.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.018
THIS IS A TIME
WHERE I CAN JUST, YOU KNOW,

14:14.020 --> 14:15.519
SIT AND CHAT WITH YOU
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

14:15.521 --> 14:16.920
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW,

14:16.922 --> 14:19.924
BECAUSE WHEN WE WENT AND WE DID
THE TOUR THROUGH THE HOUSE,

14:19.926 --> 14:22.426
THAT'S WHERE WE FOCUSED
MOSTLY ON THE ACTIVITY

14:22.428 --> 14:25.396
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU GUYS
HAVE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.966
BUT IN ORDER FOR US TO TALK
TO WHATEVER IS HERE

14:28.968 --> 14:31.235
AND GET IT TO RESPOND TO US,

14:31.237 --> 14:33.938
THE MORE INFORMATION
WE HAVE, THE BETTER.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.741
AND SO HAS THERE BEEN
ANYTHING GOING ON

14:37.743 --> 14:39.176
BEYOND JUST
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD?

14:39.178 --> 14:46.317
I JUST HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD
TO THIS BLACK MASS.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.820
ALL RIGHT.
AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?

14:48.822 --> 14:50.888
THE CAT'S SITTING
ON THE STAIRS,

14:50.890 --> 14:54.925
AND JUST STARED
UP THE STAIRS.

14:54.927 --> 14:59.997
AND THEN THE BLACK SHADOW
CAME HALFWAY DOWN THE STAIRS,

14:59.999 --> 15:02.233
WENT BACK UP AGAIN.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.302
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THAT HELPS.

15:05.304 --> 15:07.605
IT'S NOT OFTEN
WE HAVE A CASE

15:07.607 --> 15:11.208
WHERE THE ENTITY
IS SEEN SO MANY TIMES.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.576
IT LIKES TO BE SEEN.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.179
YEAH.
SOUNDS LIKE IT.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.681
SO JUST I WANTED TO KIND OF
GO THROUGH YOUR RELATIVES

15:17.683 --> 15:20.919
WHO PASSED AWAY TO TRY TO GET
SOME MORE INFORMATION.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.420
MICHELLE MENTIONED
HER DAD MIGHT BE HERE.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.824
WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
LIKE?

15:26.826 --> 15:28.859
AFTER WE WEREN'T
MARRIED ANYMORE?

15:30.095 --> 15:31.229
WE GOT TO BE FRIENDS.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.796
OKAY.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.599
- HE WAS A BIKER.
- OKAY.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.934
OKAY, AND HE ENDED UP
GETTING SICK.

15:38.237 --> 15:40.571
I WAS HIS MEDICAL PROXY
AND HIS POWER OF ATTORNEY.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.809
SO I HELPED HIM ALONG THAT WAY
UNTIL HE PASSED AWAY.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.311
AND THEN
WHAT WAS HE SICK WITH?

15:47.313 --> 15:48.913
- HE HAD CANCER.
- OKAY.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.082
ALL RIGHT.
AND NOW WHAT WAS HIS NAME AGAIN?

15:51.084 --> 15:53.985
- MICHAEL.
- MICHAEL. OKAY.

15:53.987 --> 15:57.321
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE YOU CAN
THINK OF THAT PASSED AWAY?

15:57.323 --> 15:58.690
NO.

15:58.692 --> 16:01.191
NOW, I DID WANT TO JUST
ASK REAL QUICK.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.928
HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING
SINCE YOU'VE MOVED HERE?

16:03.930 --> 16:06.163
YES.
THEY'RE IN THE GARAGE.

16:06.165 --> 16:07.932
WHAT'S IN THE GARAGE?

16:07.934 --> 16:09.600
- FILE CABINETS.
- REALLY?

16:09.602 --> 16:11.435
YES,
ALL KINDS OF STUFF.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.737
DID YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE
WHO USED TO LIVE HERE

16:13.739 --> 16:16.641
OR THE NAMES
OF THE FORMER OWNER?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.775
NO, BUT THIS HOUSE
IS VERY OLD.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.845
IT WAS BUILT IN 1946.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.013
OKAY.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.849
AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT
OF PEOPLE IN AND OUT.

16:24.851 --> 16:28.753
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
ANY STORIES AROUND HERE?

16:28.755 --> 16:33.090
YES. I WAS TOLD BY A PSYCHIC
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING HERE.

16:33.092 --> 16:36.360
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU, EXACTLY?

16:36.362 --> 16:40.131
WITHOUT HIM EVEN KNOWING
THAT THERE HAD BEEN

16:40.133 --> 16:41.832
A POOL IN THE BACKYARD,

16:41.834 --> 16:45.636
HE TOLD ME THAT SOMEBODY
HAD DROWNED IN THE POOL.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.506
BUT IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.111
SO WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

16:54.113 --> 16:57.548
TAMMY TOLD ME THAT
THE FORMER OWNER

16:57.550 --> 16:59.317
LEFT A BUNCH OF STUFF
OUT HERE.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.119
I WANTED TO SEE IF THERE WAS
ANYTHING LEFT IN THESE

17:02.121 --> 17:04.021
THAT MIGHT CLUE US IN
TO WHO SPENT TIME HERE.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.258
MAGAZINES.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.795
WHAT'S THE NAME
ON THIS ONE?

17:10.797 --> 17:13.998
LEO,
SOMEONE WHO LIKES HARLEYS.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.400
YOU KNOW WHO LIKED HARLEYS?

17:15.402 --> 17:18.335
MICHELLE'S FATHER,
YEAH, HE REALLY...

17:18.337 --> 17:19.270
HE HAD A HARLEY.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.704
YEAH, AND...
WELL, THERE'S A NAME,

17:20.705 --> 17:22.573
AND THAT'S WHAT
I WAS HOPING FOR.

17:22.575 --> 17:26.410
DID TAMMY KNOW A LEO OR ANY
OF THE FORMER HOME OWNERS?

17:26.412 --> 17:27.744
WELL, TAMMY TOLD ME.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.948
SHE SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW
ANY FORMER OWNERS.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.016
OKAY.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.986
WHAT ELSE DID YOU
LEARN FROM TAMMY?

17:34.988 --> 17:36.654
WELL, MY MOST
INTERESTING TAKEAWAY

17:36.656 --> 17:38.089
FROM TALKING TO TAMMY TODAY

17:38.091 --> 17:41.458
WAS THAT A PSYCHIC TOLD HER
SOMEONE DROWNED IN THE POOL

17:41.460 --> 17:43.027
THAT USED TO BE
ON THIS PROPERTY.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.695
I STILL NEED TO DO RESEARCH,
THOUGH,

17:44.697 --> 17:46.296
TO SEE IF ANYTHING
LIKE THAT HAPPENED.

17:46.298 --> 17:50.867
YEAH. I DON'T MIND, LIKE,
CALLING OUT EVP QUESTIONS

17:50.869 --> 17:53.103
ABOUT THAT SCENARIO,
JUST TO SEE IF WE GET ANSWERS.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.605
RIGHT. OKAY.
WELL, I MEAN, THAT'S COOL.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.641
NOW WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO GO ON,

17:56.643 --> 17:59.911
AND WE HAVE A NEW
NAME FROM HERE...

17:59.913 --> 18:02.013
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT
TAMMY'S FAMILY FOR TONIGHT.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.815
WHICH IS GREAT,
BUT BEFORE WE START,

18:03.817 --> 18:07.685
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO SHOW YOU.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.186
I WATCHED THE DVR
FOOTAGE, AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK

18:09.188 --> 18:10.821
AT SOMETHING
REALLY INTERESTING.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.389
OKAY.
THIS IS TYLER'S ROOM, RIGHT?

18:12.391 --> 18:14.324
- RIGHT.
- AND THIS IS MICHELLE'S ROOM.

18:14.326 --> 18:17.594
YEAH. THE CAT HAS BEEN SLEEPING
ON THIS BED FOR, LIKE,

18:17.596 --> 18:18.996
THE LONGEST TIME.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.298
AND IT JUST DOWN, AND NOW IT'S,
LIKE, CLEANING ITSELF.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.934
OKAY?
- OKAY.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.169
THE CAT IS LICKING HIMSELF,
NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.603
WATCH RIGHT HERE.
SEE THIS WEIRD THING?

18:26.605 --> 18:30.007
YEAH.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.876
AND THEN THE CAT LOOKS,

18:32.878 --> 18:34.444
NOTICES, COMPLETELY STOPS,

18:34.446 --> 18:36.947
AND THEN GOES
AS IF IT'S BEING CALLED.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.349
THAT'S WEIRD.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.418
HE COMES IN THIS ROOM
AND THEN SITS HERE

18:41.420 --> 18:44.354
AND JUST, LIKE, STARES
WHERE THAT THING WAS

18:44.356 --> 18:47.458
AND THEN SITS DOWN
AND JUST LOOKS.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.869
I WATCHED THE DVR
FOOTAGE, AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK

18:58.871 --> 19:00.504
AT SOMETHING
REALLY INTERESTING.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.072
OKAY.
THIS IS TYLER'S ROOM, RIGHT?

19:02.074 --> 19:03.874
- RIGHT.
- AND THIS IS MICHELLE'S ROOM.

19:03.876 --> 19:07.144
YEAH. THE CAT HAS BEEN SLEEPING
ON THIS BED FOR, LIKE,

19:07.146 --> 19:08.545
THE LONGEST TIME.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.848
AND IT JUST DOWN, AND NOW IT'S,
LIKE, CLEANING ITSELF.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.483
OKAY?
- OKAY.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.719
THE CAT IS LICKING HIMSELF,
NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.153
WATCH RIGHT HERE.
SEE THIS WEIRD THING?

19:16.155 --> 19:19.556
YEAH.

19:19.558 --> 19:22.425
AND THEN THE CAT LOOKS,

19:22.427 --> 19:23.994
NOTICES, COMPLETELY STOPS,

19:23.996 --> 19:26.496
AND THEN GOES
AS IF IT'S BEING CALLED.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.899
THAT'S WEIRD.

19:27.901 --> 19:30.968
HE COMES IN THIS ROOM
AND THEN SITS HERE

19:30.970 --> 19:33.904
AND JUST, LIKE, STARES
WHERE THAT THING WAS

19:33.906 --> 19:37.041
AND THEN SITS DOWN
AND JUST LOOKS.

19:39.612 --> 19:45.282
YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THIS
ANIMAL REACT TO SOMETHING.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.385
IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN EXTRA
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, REALLY.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.688
IT'S SO BIZARRE.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.156
WE ALWAYS HEAR STORIES
ABOUT ANIMALS

19:52.158 --> 19:53.925
REACTING TO PARANORMAL EVENTS,

19:53.927 --> 19:55.793
BUT WE HAVE NEVER CAPTURED IT
ON CAMERA

19:55.795 --> 19:58.062
BEFORE WHEN THE ANIMAL
IS COMPLETELY ALONE.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.830
CATS ACTUALLY HAVE
HEIGHTENED SENSES

19:59.832 --> 20:01.998
AND CAN DETECT THINGS
HUMANS CAN'T

20:02.000 --> 20:04.602
BECAUSE SOME SCIENTISTS
BELIEVE THEY SEE IN ULTRAVIOLET.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.404
THE FACT THAT THIS CAT RESPONDS
TO SOMETHING IN TYLER'S ROOM

20:07.406 --> 20:08.638
IS HARD TO IGNORE,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.475
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE
CORRELATING DVR EVIDENCE.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.178
AND SO DOES THIS DETECT
MOTION AT THAT TIME?

20:14.180 --> 20:16.780
YEAH. I MEAN, IT SHOWS
MOVEMENT IN THAT ROOM.

20:16.782 --> 20:20.550
WHAT'S ALSO WEIRD IS THIS CAT
IS MOVING AROUND IN THIS ROOM,

20:20.552 --> 20:22.986
AND THIS CAMERA IS NOT
REGISTERING MOTION AT ALL.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.156
IT'S STEALTH, BUT IT REGISTERS
THIS WEIRD ANOMALY

20:26.158 --> 20:28.626
LIKE SOMETHING WAS
MOVING IN THE ROOM.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.861
YEAH, BUT, I MEAN,
THIS IS ON CAMERA.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.062
YEAH.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.799
THIS PROVES WHAT THEY ARE
SEEING THE CAT DO.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.567
LIKE, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT THEY SEE THE CAT DO.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.003
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY DISPUTING

20:39.005 --> 20:40.771
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON HERE.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.539
IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF WHAT.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.275
WHAT'S OUR GAME PLAN
FOR TONIGHT LIKE?

20:45.277 --> 20:47.445
I KNOW ALREADY WE'RE GOING
TO BE FOCUSING UPSTAIRS

20:47.447 --> 20:50.815
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY
FAINT ANOMALY IN TYLER'S ROOM.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.149
RIGHT.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.458
WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT UP.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.794
AMY WILL TRY TO TALK TO MICHAEL
AND LEO IN TYLER'S ROOM

21:03.796 --> 21:06.497
WHILE I USE THE THERMAL
CAMERA IN MICHELLE'S ROOM.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.432
IT USES HEAT SIGNATURES
TO IDENTIFY

21:08.434 --> 21:12.203
BOTH SUPERNATURAL
AND NATURAL ANOMALIES.

21:12.205 --> 21:15.172
ARE YOU RELATED TO ANYONE
IN THIS HOUSE?

21:19.678 --> 21:22.079
IS YOUR NAME MICHAEL?

21:25.417 --> 21:27.451
DID YOU KNOW
SOMEONE NAMED LEO?

21:30.823 --> 21:33.357
DID YOU DROWN?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.082
IT'S VERY QUIET, ADAM.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.583
OKAY.

21:59.585 --> 22:02.653
I DIDN'T GET ANY WEIRD, LIKE,
HEAT SIGNATURES AROUND YOU.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.293
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I WAS JUST TAKING --

22:10.295 --> 22:13.130
I WAS LOOKING FOR
ALL THE PICTURES OF...

22:13.132 --> 22:17.200
HER FATHER ON A HARLEY.

22:17.202 --> 22:18.802
RIGHT.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.671
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT,
YOU KNOW,

22:20.673 --> 22:23.774
WE KNOW THAT MICHELLE'S DAD
LIKED MOTORCYCLES,

22:23.776 --> 22:26.844
AND WHOEVER THIS LEO IS
MUST HAVE LIKED THEM, TOO,

22:26.846 --> 22:29.613
JUDGING BY ALL THE MAGAZINES
IN THE GARAGE.

22:29.615 --> 22:33.283
WE GET SOME OF THAT
HARLEY-DAVIDSON MEMORABILIA,

22:33.285 --> 22:35.886
AND WE USE THE PROXIMITY SENSOR
AND ATTACH IT TO IT,

22:35.888 --> 22:38.455
AND SEE
IF WE GET A RESPONSE.

22:38.457 --> 22:39.823
LET'S DO IT.

22:39.825 --> 22:42.259
LET ME GO OUTSIDE AND GET
THAT HARLEY-DAVIDSON THINGS.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.635
WE CHOOSE TRIGGER OBJECTS
THAT HAVE SOME SORT

22:51.637 --> 22:53.570
OF PERSONAL MEANING
TO SPIRITS,

22:53.572 --> 22:56.207
SO WE ARE GOING TO USE
THE HARLEY-DAVIDSON MAGAZINES

22:56.209 --> 22:57.475
THAT WE FOUND IN THE GARAGE

22:57.477 --> 23:00.177
TO SEE IF WE CAN GET
SOME KIND OF RESPONSE.

23:03.415 --> 23:04.782
TURN THIS ON.

23:09.622 --> 23:14.257
WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS
SOMEONE NAMED MICHAEL OR LEO.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.560
WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE JOIN US
HERE IN THE LIVING ROOM,

23:16.562 --> 23:20.330
SO THAT WE CAN TALK TO YOU.

23:20.332 --> 23:25.302
WE BROUGHT SOME
HARLEY-DAVIDSON CATALOGS.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.705
WE THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU'D WANT TO LOOK AT THEM.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.807
DO YOU WANT TO REACH OUT
AND TOUCH THOSE?

23:30.809 --> 23:32.643
IF YOU DO, THIS WILL
BEEP LIKE THIS...

23:34.112 --> 23:37.447
...AND THAT'LL LET US KNOW THAT
YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THEM.

23:43.656 --> 23:47.024
MICHAEL OR LEO,
ARE YOU HERE?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.365
IF YOU'RE NOT MICHAEL,

23:55.367 --> 23:58.936
ARE YOU SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIM?

23:58.938 --> 24:02.773
WHOEVER YOU ARE,
DO YOU LIKE MOTORCYCLES?

24:07.546 --> 24:09.046
THAT DEFINITELY GOT TOUCHED.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.614
SOMETHING TOUCHED THOSE.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.327
IF YOU'RE NOT MICHAEL,

24:24.329 --> 24:27.898
ARE YOU SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIM?

24:27.900 --> 24:31.735
WHOEVER YOU ARE,
DO YOU LIKE MOTORCYCLES?

24:36.509 --> 24:38.008
THAT DEFINITELY GOT TOUCHED.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.777
SOMETHING TOUCHED THOSE.
- RIGHT.

24:40.779 --> 24:44.247
BUT WHO IS THAT PERSON?

24:44.249 --> 24:46.650
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, I KNOW --

24:46.652 --> 24:49.152
I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T VERIFIED
OR IF IT WAS MICHAEL.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.254
RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

24:50.256 --> 24:53.524
BUT WHOEVER IS HERE
LIKES MOTORCYCLES.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.492
IT IS A REACTION
TO SOMETHING.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.160
YEAH.
I MEAN, IT GOT TOUCHED.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.529
- RIGHT.
- SOMETHING TOUCHED THOSE.

24:59.531 --> 25:04.568
AT THIS POINT, IT COULD BE
MICHAEL OR LEO OR ANYONE.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.102
IT MEANS WE HAVE
TO START RESEARCHING

25:06.104 --> 25:08.339
AND FIGURE OUT
WHO ELSE THIS COULD BE.

25:08.341 --> 25:11.708
I KNOW.
LET'S KEEP FIGURING IT OUT.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.024
I DON'T DOUBT THAT
THIS ACTIVITY IS ASSOCIATED

25:27.026 --> 25:30.527
WITH THE SAME PERSON,
BUT <i> WHO</i> IS THAT PERSON?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.829
AND SO WE'LL DEFINITELY
BE FOCUSING ON THAT

25:32.831 --> 25:35.332
AS WE RESEARCH.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.372
ADAM, I THINK
I HAVE SOMETHING.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.674
I REALLY THINK...
- LIKE, SOMETHING...

25:44.676 --> 25:46.810
NO, I THINK
I HAVE SOMETHING.

25:46.812 --> 25:49.012
- ANYTHING ON POOL DROWNINGS?
- NO.

25:49.014 --> 25:50.513
WELL, I FOUND RECORDS
OF DROWNINGS,

25:50.515 --> 25:52.149
BUT NOTHING
ON THIS PROPERTY.

25:52.151 --> 25:55.418
BUT IN 2013,

25:55.420 --> 25:59.289
A MAN
WAS ON HIS MOTORCYCLE.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.658
A WOMAN IN A MINIVAN
DIDN'T SEE HIM,

26:01.660 --> 26:04.461
TOOK HIM OUT, AND HE DIED.

26:04.463 --> 26:05.829
HIS NAME WAS STEVEN.

26:05.831 --> 26:09.533
HE WAS 43,

26:09.535 --> 26:11.902
AND THAT --
I MEAN, AND HERE'S THE THING.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.137
THIS IS LITERALLY
JUST RIGHT THERE.

26:14.139 --> 26:16.774
IT'S BEHIND THE HOUSE
WHERE THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.409
OKAY. OKAY.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.812
43, DROVE HIS HARLEY-DAVID
MOTORCYCLE INTO A VAN...

26:21.814 --> 26:25.281
...IT'S A HARLEY.

26:25.283 --> 26:27.885
I MEAN, HE MAY HAVE KNOWN
MICHELLE'S FATHER

26:27.887 --> 26:28.886
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE...

26:28.888 --> 26:30.287
- RIGHT.
- YOU KNOW, BUT, LIKE...

26:30.289 --> 26:33.724
OR THE...
- THE FORMER OWNERS.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.159
YEAH.

26:35.161 --> 26:40.097
I MEAN, HARLEYS ARE REALLY BIG
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, FOR SURE.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.299
THEY HAVE PICTURES
OF HARLEYS IN HERE.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.068
THEY HAVE A HARLEY MANUAL
IN THE GARAGE.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.538
- YEAH.
- I WONDER IF HE JUST FEELS HOME.

26:47.540 --> 26:51.007
HE LIVED ON THIS STREET,
SO HE LITERALLY LIVED

26:51.009 --> 26:52.943
RIGHT UP THE STREET
FROM HERE.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.612
- OKAY.
- WHAT IF HE'S JUST LOST?

26:55.614 --> 26:57.914
WHAT IF HE CAN'T FIND
HIS WAY HOME,

26:57.916 --> 26:59.616
AND HE JUST WANDERED
IN HERE?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.918
- WHICH WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.
- YEAH, WE HAVE.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.654
MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT GHOSTS
ARE TIED TO ONE PLACE.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.923
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
BECAUSE I'VE JUST SEEN

27:06.925 --> 27:09.860
TOO MANY CASES
WHERE SOMEONE ENDS UP SOMEWHERE

27:09.862 --> 27:13.997
THAT REALLY HAD LITTLE
TO DO WITH THEIR LIFE.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.500
SO WHAT WE DO IS THIS.

27:16.502 --> 27:21.404
WE GO UPSTAIRS AND SEE IF WE GET
A RESPONSE AND GO FROM THERE.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.640
YEAH. WE JUST WANT TO, LIKE,
ASK A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS

27:23.642 --> 27:25.208
AND SEE IF WE GET
ANYTHING AT ALL.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.676
YEAH.

27:33.686 --> 27:36.219
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE SEEN A SPIRIT GET LOST

27:36.221 --> 27:38.989
AFTER A TRAUMATIC DEATH,

27:38.991 --> 27:43.727
BUT WE STILL HAVE TWO OTHER
PEOPLE WE HAVEN'T RULED OUT YET,

27:43.729 --> 27:45.062
AND SO WE NEED TO SEE
IF WE FIND

27:45.064 --> 27:47.431
ANY OTHER EVIDENCE
AS WE INVESTIGATE.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.903
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
- DISTINCT.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.839
DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE
IN THIS HOUSE?

28:02.481 --> 28:06.116
ARE YOU RELATED TO SOMEONE
IN THIS HOUSE?

28:06.118 --> 28:08.652
WHAT ROAD IS THIS?

28:16.928 --> 28:18.729
DID YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT?

28:26.304 --> 28:29.339
I MEAN, WELL, HE DIDN'T
ANSWER ANYTHING, REALLY.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.274
I WASN'T HEARING -- HONESTLY,
I WASN'T HEARING ANYTHING...

28:31.276 --> 28:33.810
- YEAH. IT'S QUIET.
- ...LIKE, NOT EVEN, LIKE...

28:33.812 --> 28:36.279
- WEIRD.
- LET'S GO DOWNSTAIRS.

28:36.281 --> 28:37.448
YEAH.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.483
SO WHAT DO WE WANT
TO DO DOWN THERE?

28:39.485 --> 28:41.818
I KNOW THAT'S WHERE
TAMMY SAID SHE SAW

28:41.820 --> 28:43.487
THAT SHADOW FIGURE
DOWN THERE.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.988
RIGHT.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.291
TYLER HAS BEEN OUR BIGGEST
CONCERN DURING THIS CASE,

28:47.293 --> 28:48.692
SO WE'VE BEEN
FOCUSING THE MAJORITY

28:48.694 --> 28:51.895
OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS
UPSTAIRS ON MICHAEL AND LEO,

28:51.897 --> 28:53.931
BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING
ANYTHING.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.700
WE NEED TO SHIFT
THE INVESTIGATION DOWNSTAIRS.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.109
SO WE'RE GOING TO BRING
THE SPIRIT BOX IN THERE.

29:06.111 --> 29:07.945
RIGHT?

29:09.180 --> 29:11.481
ANY REASON YOU
USED THE GoPro?

29:11.483 --> 29:12.482
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

29:12.484 --> 29:14.985
IT'S KNOCKING.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.357
YEAH.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.859
FROM TAMMY'S ROOM.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.647
SO TRY TO USE THIS DEVICE,
IF YOU CAN, TO TALK WITH US.

29:46.818 --> 29:50.420
ARE YOU RELATED TO THE FAMILY
THAT'S HERE NOW?

29:50.422 --> 29:52.923
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

29:59.131 --> 30:02.198
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

30:02.200 --> 30:04.401
<i>DEAD.</i>

30:04.403 --> 30:08.171
DID IT JUST SAY "DEAD"?

30:08.173 --> 30:09.039
<i>ACCIDENT.</i>

30:09.041 --> 30:11.408
"ACCIDENT."

30:25.891 --> 30:28.958
SO TRY TO USE THIS DEVICE,
IF YOU CAN, TO TALK WITH US.

30:31.129 --> 30:36.065
ARE YOU RELATED TO THE FAMILY
THAT'S HERE NOW?

30:36.067 --> 30:37.233
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

30:44.777 --> 30:48.077
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

30:48.079 --> 30:50.280
<i>DEAD.</i>

30:50.282 --> 30:54.050
DID IT JUST SAY "DEAD"?

30:54.052 --> 30:54.918
<i>ACCIDENT.</i>

30:54.920 --> 30:57.587
"ACCIDENT."

30:57.589 --> 30:59.555
DEAD? ACCIDENT?

30:59.557 --> 31:00.690
THAT'S SO CRAZY.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.861
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT.

31:03.863 --> 31:06.229
DID YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT
ON A MOTORCYCLE?

31:14.340 --> 31:18.008
STEVEN, ARE YOU HERE?
CAN YOU TALK TO US?

31:22.714 --> 31:23.747
OKAY.

31:23.749 --> 31:24.815
OKAY. STOP.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.787
WHAT IS THE SITUATION?

31:30.789 --> 31:32.389
I MEAN, I KNOW...

31:32.391 --> 31:34.157
I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T
VERIFIED ANYTHING.

31:34.159 --> 31:37.794
I KNOW THAT I'M MORE APT
TO THINK STEVEN IS HERE.

31:37.796 --> 31:38.995
MAYBE.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.398
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
WE HAVE FOUND THIS MANY TIMES,

31:41.400 --> 31:42.799
WHERE
THINGS JUST WANDER IN

31:42.801 --> 31:44.834
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,
THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED NEARBY.

31:44.836 --> 31:48.204
I THINK IF STEVEN IS HERE,

31:48.206 --> 31:50.607
I THINK HIS DEATH
WAS VERY SUDDEN,

31:50.609 --> 31:54.644
AND MAYBE HE JUST WANDERED
AWAY FROM THE ACCIDENT.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.179
YEAH.

31:56.181 --> 31:59.616
AND MAYBE HE DOESN'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON,

31:59.618 --> 32:02.786
BUT I'M NOT READY TO SAY
FOR SURE THAT'S WHO IT IS.

32:02.788 --> 32:06.189
WE'RE GETTING NO ANSWERS
FROM MICHAEL OR LEO.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.523
YEAH.

32:07.525 --> 32:10.594
MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE WEREN'T
GETTING ANY RESPONSES UPSTAIRS.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.528
WE'RE NOT ASKING
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.431
- LET'S KEEP FIGURING IT OUT.
- OKAY.

32:14.433 --> 32:19.235
BUT IT GOT QUIET ON THE SPIRIT
BOX, SO LET'S DO AN EVP SESSION.

32:19.237 --> 32:21.772
IS THERE ANYBODY HERE?

32:24.009 --> 32:27.543
WE FOUND OUT THAT SOMEONE
HAD A MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT

32:27.545 --> 32:30.346
NEAR TO HERE.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.082
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

32:35.220 --> 32:37.154
WAS YOUR HOUSE NEARBY?

32:48.900 --> 32:50.433
"I'M HERE."

32:50.435 --> 32:51.835
"I'M HERE."

32:55.707 --> 32:57.540
AGAIN, "I'M HERE."

32:57.542 --> 32:59.675
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
IT'S SAID THAT.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.711
YOU CAN USE THIS
TO TALK TO US.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.313
<i>- I'M HERE.</i>
- IT SAID "HERE."

33:04.315 --> 33:06.115
IT SAID, "I'M HERE."

33:06.117 --> 33:08.051
TWICE IT TOLD US,
"I'M HERE."

33:08.053 --> 33:09.819
LIKE, WHY IS IT...?

33:09.821 --> 33:12.522
IS THAT ALL IT WANTS, IS JUST
FOR US TO KNOW IT'S HERE?

33:12.524 --> 33:14.357
I MEAN, "I'M HERE."

33:14.359 --> 33:15.691
OKAY.
YOU'RE HERE, BUT WHAT?

33:15.693 --> 33:17.427
BUT WHAT ELSE?
WE NEED MORE.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.162
WHO ARE YOU?
OKAY. LET'S LISTEN.

33:30.775 --> 33:34.544
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW,
LIKE, WHO YOU ARE.

33:39.284 --> 33:41.685
DID YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT
NEARBY?

33:44.189 --> 33:46.590
CAN YOU JUST SAY YOUR NAME?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.099
I'M, LIKE, FRUSTRATED.

33:57.101 --> 33:58.635
I AM, TOO.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.945
WAIT.
CAN YOU PLAY THAT AGAIN?

34:12.384 --> 34:13.516
STEVEN.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.320
- YEAH.
- STEVEN.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.755
THAT'S **** STEVEN.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.009
WAIT.
CAN YOU PLAY THAT AGAIN?

34:42.647 --> 34:43.746
STEVEN.

34:47.452 --> 34:48.417
- YEAH.
- STEVEN.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.620
THAT'S **** STEVEN.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.389
STEVEN. OKAY. OKAY.
WE GOT SOMETHING.

34:52.391 --> 34:56.225
STEVEN. I MEAN,
THAT'S A CLEAR "STEVEN."

34:56.226 --> 34:58.761
BUT I WISH HE WOULD
TELL US MORE.

34:58.763 --> 34:59.896
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTION
UNANSWERED.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.432
WE JUST NEED TO
KEEP GOING.

35:02.434 --> 35:06.669
STEVEN, WE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE,

35:06.671 --> 35:09.638
SO WOULD YOU MAYBE HAVE
A CONVERSATION NOW

35:09.640 --> 35:13.243
AND FIGURE OUT WHY
YOU'RE HERE

35:13.245 --> 35:17.113
AND SEE IF, MAYBE,
WE COULD HELP YOU?

35:17.115 --> 35:20.450
ARE YOU LOST?

35:20.452 --> 35:23.853
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

35:23.855 --> 35:26.389
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

35:28.993 --> 35:30.994
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS
IS YOUR HOME NOW?

35:33.398 --> 35:34.965
OKAY. LET'S LISTEN.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.273
HE SAID "YES," RIGHT?

35:47.812 --> 35:51.614
YES. RIGHT?
- YEAH. IT SAYS "YES."

35:51.616 --> 35:55.551
<i>DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS</i>
<i>IS YOUR HOME NOW?</i>

35:55.553 --> 35:59.155
THAT'S WHY HE'S HERE.
HE'S LOST.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.091
IT WAS A REALLY AWFUL,
AWFUL SAD DEATH.

36:02.093 --> 36:03.727
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE
SO DELICATE

36:03.729 --> 36:06.128
IN HOW WE EXPLAIN THIS
TO THEM,

36:06.130 --> 36:08.130
SO HOPEFULLY,
THEY'LL BE OPEN TO THAT.

36:08.132 --> 36:09.999
RIGHT.
LET'S GO FIND OUT.

36:19.978 --> 36:21.578
THIS WAS A TOUGH ONE.
- IT WAS VERY TOUGH.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.145
- THIS WAS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.
- REALLY?

36:23.147 --> 36:25.448
IT KEPT US HANGING
UNTIL THE LAST SECOND.

36:25.450 --> 36:29.385
WE, AT THIS POINT,
KNOW WHO IS HERE.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.990
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY NOT WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE EXPECTED

36:33.992 --> 36:35.892
AT ALL, SO...
- REALLY?

36:35.894 --> 36:37.326
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

36:37.328 --> 36:39.395
WE ALWAYS SAY, "IF YOU'RE
OPEN TO THE IDEA OF GHOSTS,

36:39.397 --> 36:41.664
YOU HAVE TO BE OPEN
TO THE IDEA OF PSYCHICS, TOO."

36:41.666 --> 36:43.299
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T JUST PICK
AND CHOOSE, YOU KNOW.

36:43.301 --> 36:47.170
- TRUE.
- AND SO WE DID SO MUCH RESEARCH

36:47.172 --> 36:49.272
ON THE PROPERTY ITSELF.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.941
NO RECORD, I MEAN,
THERE WERE DROWNINGS IN THERE,

36:51.943 --> 36:55.712
BUT NONE ANYWHERE NEAR HERE,
DEFINITELY NOT IN A POOL,

36:55.714 --> 37:00.016
SO JUST NOTHING
THAT HE SAW AS FAR AS,

37:00.018 --> 37:04.387
YOU KNOW, DEATHS IN THE HOUSE
MATCHED UP WITH ANY RECORDS

37:04.389 --> 37:05.588
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.689
- RIGHT.
- I MEAN, BUT WE TRIED.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.491
- YEAH.
- I MEAN, WE DID ACTUALLY USE IT

37:08.493 --> 37:09.625
IN THE INVESTIGATION.
- WE DID.

37:09.627 --> 37:10.927
WE WOULD BRING IT UP.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.330
SOME PSYCHICS ARE BETTER
AT, LIKE, THE PERSONAL STUFF.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.065
AND THEY KNOW THINGS ABOUT YOU

37:15.067 --> 37:18.001
AND NOT AS GOOD
AT THE GHOST STUFF.

37:18.003 --> 37:19.069
TRUE.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.670
BUT WE ACTUALLY CAUGHT
SOME EVIDENCE,

37:20.672 --> 37:23.706
AND IT'S
REALLY GREAT EVIDENCE.

37:23.708 --> 37:26.409
SO I THINK --
WHAT SHOULD WE PLAY FIRST?

37:26.411 --> 37:32.348
LET ME JUST PULL UP
THIS SCREEN HERE.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.584
SO WE USED
THIS CAMERA SYSTEM

37:34.586 --> 37:36.085
AND PUT CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE IN YOUR HOUSE,

37:36.087 --> 37:38.288
SO WE CAN MONITOR
THE ACTIVITY,

37:38.290 --> 37:39.889
AND WE REALLY WANTED
TO CATCH THIS SHADOW GUY.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.357
- SURE.
- LIKE, WE WANTED TO CATCH HIM.

37:41.359 --> 37:45.929
AND THE FIRST THING I NOTICED
IS GOING TO BE IN THIS SCREEN.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.130
SEE THAT MOVEMENT
RIGHT THERE?

37:47.132 --> 37:49.199
- YES
- SEE THAT WEIRD, TINY MOVEMENT?

37:49.201 --> 37:50.567
I DID. YES.

37:50.569 --> 37:53.669
IF YOU SEE THE CAT, THE CAT
IS LICKING ITSELF, RIGHT,

37:53.671 --> 37:55.304
NOT PAYING ATTENTION
TO ANYTHING.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.641
YOU'LL SEE THIS THING
START HAPPENING IN TYLER'S ROOM.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.576
THE CAT IMMEDIATELY STOPS.

38:00.578 --> 38:02.178
SEE WHAT THE CAT DOES?

38:02.180 --> 38:03.446
YEAH.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.581
IMMEDIATELY STOPS
DOING WHAT IT'S DOING,

38:05.583 --> 38:09.385
LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION
OF TYLER'S ROOM

38:09.387 --> 38:13.990
AND GOES LIKE IT'S BEING CALLED
OR, LIKE, IT SEES SOMETHING.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.525
SO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

38:15.527 --> 38:18.561
WAS KIND OF MAYBE
WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE,

38:18.563 --> 38:19.796
WHICH IS WHAT YOU
GUYS EXPERIENCED.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.197
YES. YES.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.632
IT'S ALSO INTERESTING
THAT THE CAT SEEMS

38:22.634 --> 38:25.301
TOTALLY UNFAZED
BY THIS ANOMALY.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.171
IT'S JUST HANGING OUT,
SO IN OUR OPINION,

38:28.173 --> 38:29.638
IT MUST BE A PRETTY
HARMLESS SPIRIT

38:29.640 --> 38:32.274
BECAUSE ANIMALS HAVE
A KEEN SENSE OF DANGER.

38:32.276 --> 38:37.046
BUT HAVING THE CAT
ACTUALLY REACT TO IT,

38:37.048 --> 38:39.048
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING
TO ME.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.216
YES.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.551
WELL, YOU SUPPOSE THAT
WAS THE SHADOW MAN?

38:42.553 --> 38:44.220
AND I MEAN, THAT COULD
BE THE FORM

38:44.222 --> 38:45.988
THAT IT TAKES ON OUR CAMERA.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.191
YOU KNOW?
IT COULD BE.

38:48.193 --> 38:49.525
- SO THAT'S REALLY COOL.
- YES. YEAH.

38:49.527 --> 38:50.827
AND SO IT VERIFIES THAT

38:50.829 --> 38:52.195
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING
IN YOUR HOUSE,

38:52.197 --> 38:54.330
AND IT WAS WALKING AROUND
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.634
- YEAH.
- SO WE CAN PUT THAT AWAY.

38:58.636 --> 39:01.370
SO AMY AND I WERE DOING
THE SPIRIT BOX.

39:01.372 --> 39:05.041
BASICALLY, IT'S A RADIO THAT
FLIPS THROUGH THE CHANNELS,

39:05.043 --> 39:07.610
AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR
ANSWERS IN THE STATIC OF IT.

39:07.612 --> 39:09.879
RIGHT? SO IT'LL, LIKE,
TALK BACK TO US,

39:09.881 --> 39:13.149
AND WE TURNED IT ON
TO SEE WHAT WE GET.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.988
<i>WHY ARE YOU HERE?</i>

39:22.226 --> 39:24.827
- DEAD.
- YEAH.

39:24.829 --> 39:26.329
- ACCIDENT.
- YEAH.

39:26.331 --> 39:27.830
PRETTY CLEAR
WHAT IT WAS SAYING.

39:27.832 --> 39:30.433
YEAH,
"DEAD" AND "ACCIDENT."

39:30.435 --> 39:33.636
SO THEN WE HAVE THE FINAL
PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

39:33.638 --> 39:35.305
ONE MORE THING.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.680
WE THINK
IT'S SAYING "STEVEN."

39:47.819 --> 39:49.852
YES. I DID HEAR THAT.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.286
REALLY QUICK, "STEVEN."
- YEP.

39:51.288 --> 39:52.488
DO YOU KNOW A STEVEN?

39:52.490 --> 39:54.591
I DON'T KNOW A STEVEN.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.560
WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS THAT
RIGHT BEHIND YOUR HOUSE,

39:57.562 --> 40:00.262
IN 2013,

40:00.264 --> 40:05.167
A MAN NAMED STEVEN HAD
AN AWFUL MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT

40:05.169 --> 40:08.570
AND DIED RIGHT THERE.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.106
WE TRIED YOUR FAMILY.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.874
WE TRIED FORMER OWNERS.

40:11.876 --> 40:14.410
WE TRIED EVERYTHING WE COULD.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.013
AND THE ONLY TIME
WE GOT RESPONSES

40:17.015 --> 40:21.217
WAS WHEN WE STARTED TALKING
DIRECTLY TO THIS STEVEN PERSON,

40:21.219 --> 40:24.487
AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.622
COULD HE BE LOST?
MAYBE.

40:26.624 --> 40:28.824
WE DID DISCOVER HE LIVED
ON THIS ROAD,

40:28.826 --> 40:31.994
AND, YOU KNOW, YOUR HOUSE
IS IN-BETWEEN HIS HOUSE

40:31.996 --> 40:33.129
AND THE ACCIDENT SITE.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.297
YEAH.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.498
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE
HE JUST STARTED

40:35.500 --> 40:38.434
TRYING TO GET HOME SOMEHOW.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.735
IT JUST DOESN'T SURPRISE US.

40:39.737 --> 40:42.405
WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME,
SO...

40:42.407 --> 40:45.174
I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT
OF SIMILARITIES IN-BETWEEN.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.709
I MEAN, LIKE, HE LIKED
HARLEY-DAVIDSON.

40:46.711 --> 40:48.344
THE FORMER OWNERS
LIKED HARLEY-DAVIDSONS.

40:48.346 --> 40:50.646
THEY HAD A BUNCH OF
HARLEY-DAVIDSON CATALOGS HERE.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.848
HER DAD
HAD A COUPLE OF HARLEYS.

40:52.850 --> 40:53.983
YOU KNOW.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.318
THERE'S JUST SIMILARITIES,
YOU KNOW?

40:55.320 --> 40:57.720
IT'S, LIKE, THERE'S
HARLEY STUFF UPSTAIRS.

40:57.722 --> 40:59.522
MAYBE HE JUST KIND OF
WAS ATTRACTED

40:59.524 --> 41:02.324
TO THAT ENVIRONMENT
AND FELT COMFORTABLE,

41:02.326 --> 41:04.059
AND HE KIND OF PARKED IT
FOR A MINUTE, LITERALLY.

41:04.061 --> 41:08.197
YEAH. WHO KNOWS? HE COULD'VE
RIDDEN WITH MY EX-HUSBAND.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.232
- YEAH.
- YOU NEVER KNOW.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.299
YEAH.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.434
- THAT'S TRUE.
- THAT'S TRUE.

41:11.436 --> 41:13.235
- WE THOUGHT OF THAT AS WELL.
- YEAH.

41:13.237 --> 41:16.138
WITH THE SITUATION
WITH TYLER,

41:16.140 --> 41:18.340
I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY
WHAT THIS ALL HINGES ON

41:18.342 --> 41:20.410
BECAUSE WE DON'T
WANT HIM TO BE SCARED.

41:20.412 --> 41:22.845
IN THE PAST, WE'VE FOUND THAT
ONCE WE FIGURE OUT

41:22.847 --> 41:24.680
WHY A SPIRIT IS HERE,

41:24.682 --> 41:26.549
THEY TEND TO LEAVE
ON THEIR OWN.

41:26.551 --> 41:30.786
IF YOU DON'T WANT HIM HERE,
OR IF YOU, YOU KNOW,

41:30.788 --> 41:32.988
WANT THINGS TO CALM DOWN,

41:32.990 --> 41:36.225
IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF JUST
TALKING TO HIM RESPECTFULLY.

41:36.227 --> 41:40.730
AND ASK HIM, YOU KNOW, TO PLEASE
STOP IF HE'S SCARING YOU,

41:40.732 --> 41:43.533
AND JUST REMIND HIM
THAT HE LIVES DOWN THE ROAD,

41:43.535 --> 41:45.368
AND YOU CAN EVEN TELL HIM
HOW TO GET THERE,

41:45.370 --> 41:48.037
AND I DON'T THINK IT WOULD
BE LONG BEFORE HE MOVES ON.

41:48.039 --> 41:50.906
I MEAN, REALLY,
AN IMPORTANT THING IS,

41:50.908 --> 41:53.442
TYLER
ISN'T IN ANY DANGER,

41:53.444 --> 41:55.378
AND MICHELLE IS NOT
IN ANY DANGER.

41:55.380 --> 41:57.913
YOU'RE NOT -- NO ONE
IS IN ANY DANGER, FOR SURE.

41:57.915 --> 41:58.981
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- YEAH.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.683
I'M SO HAPPY YOU CAME.

42:00.685 --> 42:01.750
THANK YOU.

42:01.752 --> 42:02.751
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.153
YOU'RE WELCOME.

42:04.155 --> 42:06.555
I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH
HOW THINGS WENT HERE TODAY.

42:06.557 --> 42:07.957
YOU KNOW, IT WAS ONE
OF THOSE SITUATIONS

42:07.959 --> 42:09.525
WHERE I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE

42:09.527 --> 42:11.627
HOW TAMMY WAS GOING
TO RECEIVE IT.

42:11.629 --> 42:13.896
IT IS NEVER EASY
TELLING A FAMILY

42:13.898 --> 42:17.300
THAT THERE IS A STRANGER
IN THEIR HOME.

42:17.302 --> 42:19.035
NOW THAT THEY KNOW
WHO IT IS, YOU KNOW,

42:19.037 --> 42:20.703
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP
FOR THEM

42:20.705 --> 42:23.539
IN GETTING THE ACTIVITY
HERE CALMED DOWN

42:23.541 --> 42:27.276
AND, JUST MORE THAN ANYTHING,
GETTING TYLER TO A PLACE WHERE,

42:27.278 --> 42:30.413
HOPEFULLY, HE'LL BE SLEEPING
IN HIS ROOM SOON.
