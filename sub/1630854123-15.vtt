00:02.470 --> 00:04.605
All I'm saying is,
it's been a long week,

00:04.605 --> 00:06.807
and you said before
you hate visiting her.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.142
I don't.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.810
It's just--she's just
a lot to handle at times.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.979
Exactly, so why do I
need to be a part of it?

00:11.979 --> 00:13.381
She's my sister.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.583
Your sister, not mine.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.818
Okay, okay.
I'll go by myself.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.753
- You sure?
- Yes, it's fine.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.090
Because if you want me
to go with you, I will, but--

00:22.090 --> 00:24.192
Okay, if you insist.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.564
What's the matter?
- Stay here.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.266
John, what the hell
is going on?

00:32.266 --> 00:35.203
Just stay there.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.304
You!

00:36.304 --> 00:38.339
Hands where I can
see them, now.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.874
Whoa! Whoa, what's going on?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.377
On the ground,
face down, arms out wide.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.412
Hey, I don't know
who you think I am,

00:44.412 --> 00:45.613
or what I've done--

00:45.613 --> 00:46.647
John, what the hell
is going on?

00:46.647 --> 00:47.815
Should I call the cops?

00:48.816 --> 00:50.318
John!

00:50.318 --> 00:51.819
No!

00:53.954 --> 00:55.456
Help me, please!

00:55.456 --> 00:57.991
Call 911. He needs help!

01:10.471 --> 01:13.307
Yeah, I see that.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.975
Hey, you busy?

01:14.975 --> 01:17.511
Hey. No, not really.
What's up?

01:17.511 --> 01:19.813
A few of us are
getting together tonight,

01:19.813 --> 01:23.851
last minute, at that great new
steakhouse in Tribeca, Lola's.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.453
How fun.
What's the occasion?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.588
Uh, just sort
of teambuilding.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.123
You know, keep up the morale.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.291
I love that.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.492
I, uh--I can't.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.661
I've got courtside seats
to the Knicks.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.929
Courtside? Wow.
How'd you score those?

01:35.929 --> 01:39.167
This guy that
I'm sort of dating.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.701
Sort of dating?

01:40.701 --> 01:44.505
Yeah. It's casual for now.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.107
Mm-hmm.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.942
Well, fire up the JOC.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.779
Yeah, I'll get Tiff
and Scola to the scene.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.081
Victim's John Reagan.
Worked State Department.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.949
Not sure in what capacity,
but he was carrying.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.219
- A robbery gone bad?
- No.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.321
Wife said her husband
initiated the confrontation,

02:00.321 --> 02:03.791
tried to detain the shooter,
got killed in the process.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.360
- She say why?
- Nope.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.928
After you get those photos,

02:07.928 --> 02:11.399
we're gonna need those shell
casings sent to the lab ASAP.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.566
We need to pull
the security footage

02:12.566 --> 02:13.867
from the stores
and traffic cams

02:13.867 --> 02:16.604
within a three-block radius.
- Yes, ma'am.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.342
He didn't return fire?
- Nope.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.044
Wife said she might have
distracted him.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.879
Perp took advantage.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.883
I don't know why
he pulled his gun.

02:29.883 --> 02:33.687
I've never seen my husband
act this way.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.223
I didn't mean to distract him.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.358
Everything just happened
so fast.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.695
I know this is hard,
but we do need answers

02:41.695 --> 02:43.431
so that we can find the man
that did this.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.934
What did the suspect look like?

02:46.934 --> 02:50.137
White, I think.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.972
It was so fast.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.274
I can't really
remember that much.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.342
Everything's a blur.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.843
Clothing?

02:55.843 --> 02:59.146
Dark pants
and jacket, I think.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.248
I can't be sure.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.482
It's okay.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.517
You're doing fine.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.486
We understand that
your husband worked

03:05.486 --> 03:07.020
for the State Department.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.156
In what capacity?

03:09.156 --> 03:11.492
Security for embassies.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.127
His last assignment
was Croatia.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.630
I think this might be related.
- Why is that?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.032
The man that shot him,
he had an accent--

03:19.032 --> 03:21.168
sounded Eastern European.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.143
I can't believe he's gone.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.916
We're gonna do everything
in our power

03:35.916 --> 03:39.119
to find the man that did this
to your husband,

03:39.119 --> 03:40.220
I promise you.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.795
All right, folks.
So our DOA is John Reagan.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.863
Uh, his last assignment
was working security

03:49.863 --> 03:51.465
for the American embassy
in Croatia.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.001
His wife thinks there's
some kind of connection, but--

03:54.001 --> 03:55.803
well, you know,
wives aren't always right.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.471
So let's dig into the evidence.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.172
Kelly, are we getting anything
with those shell casings?

03:59.172 --> 04:01.275
Yeah, looks like a
9-millimeter, no prints or DNA.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.876
Hmm.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.878
Well, rumor is, when one door
closes, often another opens.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.447
Ian, you got that open door?

04:06.447 --> 04:08.749
Any usable surveillance video
near the crime scene?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.318
I think I have something.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.286
It looks like there's footage
of the suspect running away

04:12.286 --> 04:13.654
a half-block from the shooting.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.088
All right, throw it up.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.925
Eyes up, people.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.393
Uh-huh.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.794
Facial rec, or--

04:20.794 --> 04:22.863
No--baseball hat is too low,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.932
plus now he's wearing
dark sunglasses.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.467
All right, so he knows
what he's doing.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.868
He knows there's cameras everywhere.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.370
Good for him,
but you know what they say--

04:29.370 --> 04:31.539
hard work beats talent
when talent doesn't work hard,

04:31.539 --> 04:33.907
so let's work harder
and catch this guy.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.543
And I promise,
that's the last tropey thing

04:35.543 --> 04:36.977
I'll say this afternoon.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.812
Hey, anything interesting
from the State Department?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.481
No, not yet,
but his supervisor

04:40.481 --> 04:43.283
is on his way over here now.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.553
John Reagan worked
at the Croatian embassy,

04:45.553 --> 04:47.020
but he was all
low-level stuff--

04:47.020 --> 04:49.490
uh, body protection, forward
recon, things like that.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.426
His wife said she thought
the shooter had an accent.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.794
Maybe he was from there.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.563
Eastern Europe
is a big place.

04:55.563 --> 04:58.366
Lots of accents, countries.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.200
I get it, Agent Morales,

05:00.200 --> 05:02.970
but there could be
a connection, given the facts.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.605
So if there is any information

05:04.605 --> 05:06.707
you can give us
that could help...

05:06.707 --> 05:08.709
Um, I don't know
what else to say.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.315
Okay, well, this is
a photo of the shooter.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.651
Does he look familiar?

05:20.087 --> 05:22.022
- No.
- Well, not to you.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.657
But he obviously did to Reagan,

05:23.657 --> 05:26.259
which is why
he apprehended him.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.029
I get it, but I have
no basis of knowing

05:29.029 --> 05:30.698
if this has anything
to do with Croatia

05:30.698 --> 05:33.534
or the State Department.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.769
John was a good guy.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.705
He worked security
at the American embassy.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.473
Not much more to say.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.875
But given the fact that
he tried to detain the shooter,

05:41.875 --> 05:43.877
that feels work-related.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.415
Could be, but I need
more information.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.883
No, we need more information.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.419
Like was Reagan
really a flunky,

05:51.419 --> 05:52.886
or was he in the game?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.625
He was a State Department employee.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.496
I'm sorry?

06:02.496 --> 06:04.231
We're trying to find the person
responsible for killing

06:04.231 --> 06:06.434
one of your colleagues,
and you are acting coy.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.568
We're on the same team here.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.769
Oh, we're not.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.304
Same country,
but different team.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.344
John was a good man.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.246
I wish you luck.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.682
Hope to God you find
the punk who did it.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.124
So was he trying to lie?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.726
Or trying
to tell us something?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.227
Well, my guess
is a little of both.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.696
Low-level embassy jobs
are filled

06:35.696 --> 06:37.097
with intelligence assets.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.999
I'm guessing that
Reagan was a spook.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.001
Yeah, me too.
I'll reach out to Morales's

06:41.001 --> 06:43.203
boss and see what I can learn.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.172
Police just found footage
of a suspect getting out

06:45.172 --> 06:48.141
of the cab three blocks
from the crime scene.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.410
Cab company said
they dropped this guy

06:50.410 --> 06:51.479
off here a couple hours ago.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.146
Yeah, I know the guy.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.215
He and a friend
are staying in room 10.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.017
A friend?
Male or female?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.252
Male,
about the same age as him.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.454
What does he look like?

07:00.454 --> 07:02.055
I don't know, white,
sort of short.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.391
You ask me, they both seemed
like a couple of wackos--

07:04.391 --> 07:05.693
and dirty.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.695
They don't even let
the maids clean the room.

07:07.695 --> 07:08.829
Okay. They here now?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.097
Your guess
is as good as mine.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.832
What name is the room under?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.601
I don't know.
Neither of them gave one.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.402
ID is required
to rent a room.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.370
Well, what can I say?
Cash is cash.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.472
Need to keep the lights on.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.044
All right, we'll take the key
to room 10, please.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.119
Great.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.554
Look, these rooms are small,

07:33.554 --> 07:35.723
so why don't we clear
the space, you guys post up?

07:35.723 --> 07:37.224
Copy that.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.165
FBI!

07:49.603 --> 07:51.772
Clear.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.041
Place is empty.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.843
Looks like
they knew we were coming.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.377
Left in a hurry.
- Well, yeah.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.779
You kill a man
in broad daylight,

07:58.779 --> 08:01.014
you gotta expect the cops
to come after you.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.286
Looks like our killer and his
roommate were religious.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.792
Maggie, run! Grenade!

08:11.792 --> 08:12.826
- Go!
- Go!

08:37.818 --> 08:39.887
So looks like these guys
were expecting us.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.622
Yeah.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.490
Place has a few
exterior security cameras.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.593
We're forwarding the footage
to 26 Fed now.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.327
Hopefully they will get
a good shot of their faces,

08:47.327 --> 08:48.495
since it doesn't look like
any evidence

08:48.495 --> 08:50.297
survived the explosion.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.566
- Right.
- Means we're nowhere.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.201
We're not nowhere.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.036
We've got this.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.307
Okay.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.981
I need to know
what the hell is going on.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.316
I told you, I can't discuss--

09:09.316 --> 09:10.884
No, no, four of my agents

09:10.884 --> 09:13.353
just walked into a motel
that was rigged with a grenade.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.955
They could have died.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.090
I have to know what, exactly,
is happening.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.359
Who was John Reagan and why
was he really in Croatia?

09:19.359 --> 09:21.595
I wanna help. I do.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.932
But I keep telling you,
my hands are tied.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.971
If you have something specific,

09:30.971 --> 09:34.041
if you have an actual lead
to a potential killer, call me.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.442
I'll see what I can do.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.879
But until then,
I can't talk about John Reagan

09:38.879 --> 09:41.214
without my supervisor's
consent.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.916
Sorry. It is what it is.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.955
Hey, any updates
from the State Department?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.691
No, Morales' boss just kept
repeating the same party line,

09:50.691 --> 09:53.627
insisting that Reagan was just
a low-level member

09:53.627 --> 09:54.895
of the embassy security detail.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.296
And they expect us
to believe that?

09:56.296 --> 09:57.631
They don't care what we think.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.768
Let's go over their head.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.269
Talk to the director
of the CIA.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.004
No, we're gonna get
the same answer.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.640
I know this is frustrating,
but they won't reveal any intel

10:06.640 --> 10:08.475
unless we have actual proof

10:08.475 --> 10:09.910
that Reagan's
overseas activities

10:09.910 --> 10:11.478
are connected
to this investigation.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.146
That's just the way it is.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.748
Right. All right.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.283
So I guess we're gonna have
to solve this case our own way,

10:16.283 --> 10:18.451
work the few clues
we have, right?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.054
Okay. Hey, Ian.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.555
Any luck identifying
that cross?

10:22.555 --> 10:25.092
Looks to be
a Croatian testament cross.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.493
Mm, confirms we're dealing

10:26.493 --> 10:27.828
with someone
from Eastern Europe.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.396
Well, from Croatia, no less,
the same place

10:29.396 --> 10:31.498
our victim was last stationed.
I guess the wife was right.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.600
Hey, we just found something.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.372
The timestamp is 20 minutes
before our team

10:39.372 --> 10:40.808
showed up on the scene.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.542
And they're both wearing
hoodies and sunglasses,

10:42.542 --> 10:43.977
so no facial rec, I presume.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.479
Correct.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.915
Oh, wait,
there's something hanging

10:47.915 --> 10:50.583
from the primary suspect's
backpack.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.919
Can you punch in on that?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.990
It's an ID badge.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.726
Hudson Genetics.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.331
Yeah, I know the guy.
His name is Luca Cilic.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.699
He works here?

11:05.699 --> 11:07.968
Not anymore.
I fired the guy two days ago.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.402
Why is that?

11:09.402 --> 11:11.739
He tried to access
a restricted area of the lab.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.173
Any specific reason?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.744
Not sure, but we have
a zero-tolerance policy.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.245
We need to see
his employment file

11:18.245 --> 11:19.546
and speak to his supervisor.

11:19.546 --> 11:20.848
Sure, I'll text him.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.649
I was just with him
a few minutes ago.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.254
What the hell?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.431
No!

11:38.431 --> 11:39.599
What's going on?

11:43.670 --> 11:45.105
We need to lock down
the lab now.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.406
Yes, sir.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.707
And get Hazmat out here.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.542
I need people inside
to inventory the contents

11:49.542 --> 11:51.611
of that open freezer ASAP.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.213
Sir, what the hell
is going on?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.915
It--it's nothing.
We have it under control.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.416
Okay, it doesn't seem
like nothing,

11:56.416 --> 11:58.485
and you look really scared
right now.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.687
I am. I--

12:00.687 --> 12:03.023
I think someone
just stole something.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.792
If you'll excuse me,
I have to coordinate

12:04.792 --> 12:06.293
an evacuation of the building.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.395
And I suggest the two of you
leave immediately as well.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.043
Okay, the building is secure,
so we need answers now.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.311
Just one second.
I need to--

12:24.311 --> 12:26.213
No, hold on. No, no, no.
What is going on?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.217
You said something was stolen,
so what was it?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.521
We've been developing
a synthetic virus.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.590
Okay, and someone
stole that virus?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.259
It looks that way.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.460
Well, don't you have
cameras in the lab?

12:40.460 --> 12:41.862
Yes.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.630
Then we need to see
that footage right now.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.798
Okay, follow me.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.871
There's a two-party protocol
to access the specimen freezer.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.306
My ID needs to be swiped
along with the researcher's.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.176
That didn't happen, so the
alarms immediately went off.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.079
Hold up. There's someone.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.215
Okay, that's where the alarm
got triggered.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.019
The guy jamming the door,
who is that?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.589
Wait, rewind it.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.191
Stop.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.725
Jim Leavins.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.062
He's a professor,
a researcher here at the lab.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.729
Okay, why would he wanna
steal his own research?

13:16.729 --> 13:18.798
I have no idea.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.604
We've been working
on a vaccine, but--

13:24.604 --> 13:26.039
A vaccine for what?

13:26.039 --> 13:28.075
COVID.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.077
We've been creating
a vaccine to protect people

13:30.077 --> 13:31.979
from any and all COVID strains.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.813
So that's what
the synthetic virus is?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.582
It's just another strain
of COVID?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.851
More like a super strain.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.820
It's 1,000 times
more virulent than COVID-19.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.457
If it were to be released
into the community,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.493
millions of people will die.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.472
We believe the man
who shot John Reagan

13:59.472 --> 14:01.942
is involved in the theft
of a dangerous strain

14:01.942 --> 14:03.476
of the COVID virus.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.112
Something that
could be weaponized,

14:05.112 --> 14:07.514
something that could be used as
a weapon of mass destruction.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.482
We also believe you know more
about Reagan

14:09.482 --> 14:11.184
and the shooter
than you're letting on.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.419
Well, you know
how this works.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.887
I can only talk
about certain things.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.855
Not with the possibility
of mass casualties,

14:15.855 --> 14:17.824
and not when
you're talking to the FBI.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.227
Okay, I understand.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.429
But this is all off the record.
I don't have clearance to--

14:22.429 --> 14:24.364
Fine, it's off the record.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.466
Now, tell us everything
you know about Reagan

14:26.466 --> 14:28.468
and this guy Luca Cilic.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.204
Yeah.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.507
Name's obviously an AKA,
but I know the face.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.409
He was the guy in the
ball cap and glasses

14:36.409 --> 14:38.011
you showed me earlier.
- Right.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.847
He was working at a place
called Hudson Genetics.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.951
It looks like he conspired with
one of the researchers there,

14:43.951 --> 14:47.587
a guy named James Leavins,
to steal a super infectious

14:47.587 --> 14:50.123
and lethal strain
of the COVID virus.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.925
And the beta version
of the vaccine

14:51.925 --> 14:53.826
they're developing
to combat the virus.

14:53.826 --> 14:59.299
Last I heard, this guy you're
calling Cilic was in Canada.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.501
Some small town
called Hawkesbury.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.902
Okay, well,
he's in New York now.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.704
He must have slipped
across the border.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.074
We would have been notified
if he entered legally.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.109
And you think he shot Reagan?

15:09.109 --> 15:10.677
We know he did.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.946
And we also know he is involved
in the theft of the virus,

15:12.946 --> 15:14.814
so you need to start
answering questions

15:14.814 --> 15:16.049
and stop asking them.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.785
Yeah. Okay.

15:18.785 --> 15:19.987
Yeah, I get it.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.059
I'll start with Reagan.

15:26.059 --> 15:29.162
Like I said before,
he worked for the embassy.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.699
But he was also involved
in a few

15:32.699 --> 15:35.168
top-secret
State Department operations.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.803
Okay, so he's a spy?

15:38.638 --> 15:41.274
- Correct.
- And what about Cilic?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.076
Other than the fact
that he likes AKAs

15:43.076 --> 15:44.844
and to vacation in Canada?

15:46.379 --> 15:48.281
He's a member
of a religious terrorist group

15:48.281 --> 15:49.316
based in Croatia.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.984
They're all ex-soldiers

15:50.984 --> 15:54.787
looking for independence
from the current regime.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.289
Why?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.791
Well, they claim
the government has been

15:58.791 --> 16:00.960
systematically
rooting out Catholics

16:00.960 --> 16:02.962
with extreme
political views like theirs.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.031
And Reagan?

16:04.031 --> 16:05.298
Why was he keeping tabs
on them?

16:05.298 --> 16:06.566
I can't really
get into all that,

16:06.566 --> 16:10.870
but the Croatian government
is an ally.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.006
This would have been
really great to know

16:13.006 --> 16:14.307
the first time we spoke.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.209
Like I said,
I'm not at liberty--

16:16.209 --> 16:17.877
I'm not at liberty
to disclose.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.079
I know.

16:19.079 --> 16:22.482
I've heard that speech
a thousand times.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.386
Sorry to interrupt.
We just pinged Leavins' phone.

16:32.692 --> 16:33.926
Okay.

16:33.926 --> 16:34.961
He's still hitting
off the same tower,

16:34.961 --> 16:36.229
about 600 yards away.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.364
Okay.
Maggie and I will go east.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.698
You guys go west.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.000
White male,
medium build, 47 years old.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.237
Last seen wearing
a gray backpack, red ski cap.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.139
All right.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.540
What is going on here?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.076
The scientist is trying
to steal the same virus

16:49.076 --> 16:50.377
he's been trying to create?
That doesn't make any sense.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.179
No, it doesn't.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.380
Maggie, I think I see him.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.749
Heading away,
olive jacket, ski cap.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.485
Yeah, he's got the backpack.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.887
We have eyes on Leavins.
He's heading east.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.137
- FBI.
- What's going on?

17:17.137 --> 17:19.339
Sorry.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.254
I got eyes.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.455
9 o'clock.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.695
It's a drop, not a handoff.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.131
Hey, stay on him.
- Yep.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.341
James Leavins!

17:54.341 --> 17:56.276
Hands up now!

17:56.276 --> 17:58.611
Don't shoot, please.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.113
<i>I've got Leavins in custody.</i>

18:00.113 --> 18:03.116
Tiff, Scola, get into
position to secure the virus.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.759
Hey, Cilic!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.060
Stop!

18:14.060 --> 18:15.395
Hey, FBI!

18:19.932 --> 18:21.801
Get down!
Everybody, get down!

18:26.506 --> 18:27.907
Stop!

18:37.950 --> 18:40.153
Hey, get down!
Stay where you are!

18:41.754 --> 18:44.224
Move, move! Get back!

18:55.502 --> 18:57.470
We lost Cilic.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.706
Last seen headed east.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.179
Tell me we have eyes
on Cilic.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.580
- We're looking, boss.
- Well, look harder.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.482
We need to find this guy.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.717
You know what?

19:10.717 --> 19:11.951
We need to get
some choppers in the air.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.486
Mike, choppers.
Can you make that happen?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.555
- You got it.
- Thank you.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.457
Ian, work with TSA.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.226
Contact airline carriers,
every airport,

19:19.226 --> 19:21.561
public and private,
in the tri-state area.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.863
We need to lock this city down.
- Yes, sir.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.135
Hey, Maggie.
Bring Leavins to 26 Fed.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.903
We need answers.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.608
Like I've been saying,
my intentions are noble.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.277
Yes, you do keep saying that,

19:37.277 --> 19:39.045
but we're trying to figure out
how stealing something

19:39.045 --> 19:42.649
that can kill millions
of people is somehow noble.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.654
This man--

19:47.654 --> 19:51.958
he warned me
not to say anything, so...

19:51.958 --> 19:55.762
I can't really tell you
what's going on, but...

19:55.762 --> 19:58.197
I'm not a criminal.
I'm not. I--I swear.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.967
Listen, you are staring down
some real time.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.035
You've already committed
a slew of federal crimes,

20:03.035 --> 20:06.539
so if I were you,
I would start talking.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.917
He forced me to do it,

20:17.917 --> 20:21.454
to steal the virus
and the vaccine.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.889
Okay. Who is he?

20:22.889 --> 20:25.692
And what do you mean
forced you?

20:25.692 --> 20:29.996
His name is, uh, Luca Cilic.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.765
He wanted the virus and the
vaccine we've been developing.

20:32.765 --> 20:38.037
Said if I didn't steal them...

20:38.037 --> 20:40.072
he'd kill my wife.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.313
Okay, I understand why
that would be frightening.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.548
But what I don't understand
is why you didn't tell us

20:48.548 --> 20:50.317
so we could help you.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.819
- It was too late for all that.
- What do you mean?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.723
May I show you something?

21:07.300 --> 21:09.869
Cilic sent me
this photo earlier.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.976
Like I said,

21:16.976 --> 21:19.546
it was too late
to ask for help.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.858
- Kelly.
- Yeah?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.159
What's going on?
Where's Cilic?

21:33.159 --> 21:34.527
He couldn't have
just disappeared.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.295
Well, we're striking out
on traffic cams

21:36.295 --> 21:37.764
in the vicinity
of the boardwalk.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.699
And what about Leavins' wife,
the proof of life photo?

21:39.699 --> 21:41.701
Can we figure out what phone
it was sent from?

21:41.701 --> 21:44.637
Yeah, it's a burner,
but it's been turned off.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.138
Yeah, but whoever
sent that photo,

21:46.138 --> 21:47.607
they didn't wipe the geotags.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.576
I got latitude, longitude
of where that photo

21:49.576 --> 21:51.544
was taken, when it was taken.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.480
Coordinates are indicating
she's being held

21:53.480 --> 21:55.448
at a warehouse
in Long Island City.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.816
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Tiff.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.085
We have a possible location
for Leavins' wife.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.252
You guys get over there
right away.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.021
Ian will give you the address.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.123
What's going on with Leavins?
Is he cooperating?

22:04.123 --> 22:05.324
No, not yet.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.393
I'm gonna take
another run at him.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.645
<i>Mr. Leavins, we are doing
everything we can</i>

22:25.645 --> 22:28.515
to find your wife, but we need
to know more about Cilic.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.783
Do you know
where he was living?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.519
No.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.655
Did you ever meet
any of his friends?

22:35.655 --> 22:37.189
No.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.259
Did he tell you what
he was gonna do with the virus?

22:40.259 --> 22:41.694
Of course not.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.911
Hey, Scola. Check this out.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.614
Got some food containers.
Might be able to pull DNA.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.785
We should get that down
to the JOC.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.787
<i>Okay, did he ever
discuss politics,</i>

23:07.787 --> 23:09.989
uh, rant about
the Croatian government,

23:09.989 --> 23:11.290
its political leaders?

23:11.290 --> 23:13.192
No, we weren't close
like that.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.194
Mr. Leavins, I wanna know

23:15.194 --> 23:17.096
everything you know
about Cilic.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.465
Everything he's ever
said to you.

23:18.465 --> 23:21.768
I wanna help, but I can't.

23:21.768 --> 23:26.839
If Cilic is apprehended
before he flees the country,

23:26.839 --> 23:30.176
his associate
will murder my wife.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.253
<i>We are your best chance
of saving your wife.</i>

23:41.253 --> 23:44.290
No.
I need to trust my instincts.

23:44.290 --> 23:47.694
My wife's life depends on it.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.696
If you find her,

23:49.696 --> 23:52.298
I'll tell you
everything I know.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.436
<i>You're wrong about this.</i>

23:57.436 --> 24:00.740
<i>We are your best option,
not the terrorist.</i>

24:02.875 --> 24:04.343
Hey, Tiff?

24:07.013 --> 24:08.748
At least now we know
she was here.

24:10.650 --> 24:14.086
Hey, so no sign
of Mrs. Leavins,

24:14.086 --> 24:15.688
but we found her shoe--

24:15.688 --> 24:17.824
a sneaker she was seen wearing
in a recent social media post.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.860
- So that means she was there.
- Right, exactly.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.663
Now, could be they
moved her to a new location,

24:23.663 --> 24:25.965
or they--they took her
with them.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.300
Yeah, but either way,
the clock is still ticking.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.969
Let's talk to Leavins again.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.639
I've got a new angle.
Just play along.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.612
Mr. Leavins, good news.

24:39.612 --> 24:42.148
We found your wife.
- You found her?

24:42.148 --> 24:44.016
She's--she's--she's okay?

24:44.016 --> 24:47.153
Yeah, yeah, she's doing well,
all things considered.

24:50.857 --> 24:54.393
She's being debriefed
right now.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.529
Can I talk to her?

24:56.529 --> 24:58.831
Um, no, uh,
like Agent Bell said,

24:58.831 --> 25:00.533
she is being debriefed
right now.

25:00.533 --> 25:03.169
But she's okay?
She--she wasn't injured?

25:03.169 --> 25:04.537
No, we don't believe so.

25:04.537 --> 25:08.274
She will undergo
a full medical examination.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.910
Okay.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.979
That's great news.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.413
It sure is.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.618
Now we need to focus
on finding Luca Cilic.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.386
We need to secure the virus

25:20.386 --> 25:22.221
before he sells it
or weaponizes it.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.957
Right. I understand.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.726
You realize the only reason
I stole it

25:26.726 --> 25:28.427
was because of that photo, right?

25:28.427 --> 25:29.662
Yes.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.363
You did commit
a series of crimes,

25:31.363 --> 25:33.700
but we understand
why you did what you did.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.902
And I am sure
with your cooperation,

25:35.902 --> 25:38.137
we can come
to a favorable deal.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.640
Okay. Thank you.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.774
Now I need you to tell me--

25:41.774 --> 25:44.577
Just put her on the phone.

25:44.577 --> 25:47.814
I-I just wanna hear her voice.
I've been so scared.

25:47.814 --> 25:50.316
I was convinced she was dead.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.084
Um.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.453
Like we said,
she is being debriefed,

25:54.453 --> 25:55.554
so it's not possible.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.495
What's going on?

26:03.495 --> 26:05.064
Excuse me?

26:05.064 --> 26:07.600
Something's going on here.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.869
Yeah, something's going on.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.570
You give a lethal virus
to a terrorist.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.772
That's not it.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.444
I don't trust you.

26:19.946 --> 26:23.182
I need proof she's alive,
or I'm done talking.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.289
Hey, have you finished
scrubbing Leavins' phone?

26:30.289 --> 26:31.891
Yeah, nothing too useful,

26:31.891 --> 26:34.060
just a few texts
about the dropoff location,

26:34.060 --> 26:35.461
the address.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.496
Okay, what about
the proof of life photo?

26:37.496 --> 26:38.798
Did it come
from the same number?

26:38.798 --> 26:40.733
No,
that is a different phone,

26:40.733 --> 26:42.902
a burner that was shut off
three hours ago.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.370
Any luck?

26:44.370 --> 26:47.439
No. No, we're nowhere.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.841
Were there any personal photos
or videos

26:48.841 --> 26:50.242
of Leavins' wife on his phone?

26:50.242 --> 26:51.577
Uh, yeah. Lots.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.813
Vacations, restaurants.
- Good. All right.

26:53.813 --> 26:54.947
I'm gonna need you
to take a few--

26:54.947 --> 26:56.015
Um.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.086
You sure you wanna double down?

27:00.086 --> 27:01.587
No. No, Maggie.

27:01.587 --> 27:02.989
It's pretty much
the last damn thing

27:02.989 --> 27:04.891
that I wanna do right now,
but I'm trying to stop

27:04.891 --> 27:07.126
a deadly virus
from being released.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.327
That is my only goal.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.495
And that should be yours
as well,

27:09.495 --> 27:13.432
so you can get on board,
or you may go.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.573
Look, I'm not sure what--

27:21.573 --> 27:24.977
Ian, just do what I ask.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.560
<i>She keeps talking about
her time in New Haven.</i>

27:41.560 --> 27:42.929
<i>We get it, she went to Yale.</i>

27:42.929 --> 27:44.731
<i>She keeps talking about--</i>

27:44.731 --> 27:45.832
<i>She keeps talking about her--</i>

27:48.735 --> 27:50.402
<i>Get over here
as soon as possible.</i>

27:50.402 --> 27:52.872
<i>I'm not sure how much of this
I can handle on my own.</i>

27:54.306 --> 27:56.142
<i>I can handle on my own.</i>

27:56.142 --> 27:58.244
<i>So sorry you couldn't
be here tonight, James,</i>

27:58.244 --> 28:00.546
<i>but the food is amazing.</i>

28:00.546 --> 28:01.781
<i>Still trying to make sense</i>

28:01.781 --> 28:03.349
<i>of how I'm going
to eat all this,</i>

28:03.349 --> 28:05.651
<i>but it tastes delightful.</i>

28:07.987 --> 28:09.655
<i>Still trying to make sense</i>

28:09.655 --> 28:11.057
<i>of how I'm going
to eat all this.</i>

28:12.658 --> 28:13.726
<i>Still trying to make sense</i>

28:13.726 --> 28:15.361
<i>of how I'm going
to eat all this.</i>

28:18.998 --> 28:21.200
<i>See you soon. Love you. Bye.</i>

28:39.318 --> 28:40.820
<i>I'm okay, James.</i>

28:41.821 --> 28:43.722
<i>I'm okay, James.</i>

28:50.162 --> 28:52.331
<i>I'm okay, James.</i>

28:52.331 --> 28:55.601
<i>I'm still trying to make sense
of what happened,</i>

28:55.601 --> 28:58.637
<i>but the good news is,
I'm alive.</i>

29:00.672 --> 29:02.641
Oh, she's okay.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.676
Oh, my God, she's okay.

29:04.676 --> 29:07.479
She's really okay.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.751
Thank you.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.686
Thank you so much
for saving her.

29:18.825 --> 29:21.693
Now, tell me everything

29:21.693 --> 29:22.829
Cilic said to you.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.330
I wanna know every detail.

29:27.199 --> 29:33.005
Um, he wasn't
all that communicative.

29:33.005 --> 29:38.277
But he asked lots of questions
about the virus's limitations,

29:38.277 --> 29:40.913
how long could it survive,
did it need to be stored at a--

29:40.913 --> 29:43.749
at a certain temperature.

29:43.749 --> 29:45.217
And what did you tell him?

29:47.153 --> 29:50.789
I explained that
the virus is durable.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.324
It could survive
almost anywhere.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.660
But the vaccine isn't.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.397
It will only stay viable
for about eight hours.

29:58.397 --> 30:01.901
After that, if left unfrozen,
it'll expire.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.003
How did he respond
to that information?

30:05.972 --> 30:10.642
When I told him about the
vaccine, he seemed relieved.

30:10.642 --> 30:14.646
Said something like, he only
was going to need seven hours,

30:14.646 --> 30:17.716
so he was going to be okay.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.218
And did he say anything else?

30:21.187 --> 30:23.322
I think he said
he had friends waiting

30:23.322 --> 30:27.960
with proper equipment
to take it to Croatia.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.661
Something like that.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.134
Is that it?

30:37.103 --> 30:38.837
Yes, that's it.
That's all.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.182
Thank you both.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.353
So much.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.861
Okay, I can't believe that we
just created a deepfake video.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.697
Maggie, we did
what we had to do.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.798
Yeah.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.400
Right now, we need to focus

31:08.400 --> 31:10.802
and move on to Cilic.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.471
Okay, um,

31:12.471 --> 31:15.541
a direct flight to Croatia
will take 10 to 12 hours,

31:15.541 --> 31:17.676
and every airport
around here is on high alert.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.913
He would be a fool
to take a plane.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.082
Cilic said he only
needed seven hours.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.150
Mm-hmm.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.617
That's about
how long it takes

31:25.617 --> 31:27.519
to drive
to the Canadian border.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.521
Okay, but why Canada?

31:29.521 --> 31:33.325
The State Department said
that they saw Cilic in Canada

31:33.325 --> 31:34.860
before he was spotted
in New York.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.562
I don't know, maybe he's got
friends or family up there,

31:36.562 --> 31:38.030
but the math works.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.932
Let's dig into that and notify
the Canadian authorities.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.235
Hey, Scola. What do you have?

31:43.235 --> 31:45.371
I just talked to a witness--
saw a dark gray Jeep

31:45.371 --> 31:47.039
pull away from the warehouse
about two hours ago.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.240
Didn't get a look at the plate

31:48.240 --> 31:49.841
but said there were
two men inside.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.944
Okay, well, that's helpful.
Did she get a look at the men?

31:51.944 --> 31:54.446
Yeah, said that they were
both white, medium build.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.782
One of them was about 6 foot.
The other was a little shorter.

31:56.782 --> 31:59.351
All right, that's a match
for Cilic and his associate.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.487
We'll get out a BOLO and start
scrubbing traffic cams.

32:01.487 --> 32:04.090
What about Mrs. Leavins?
Any sign of a woman?

32:04.090 --> 32:05.891
<i>No, just the two men.</i>

32:05.891 --> 32:07.526
All right.
Keep looking for her.

32:07.526 --> 32:08.827
Copy that.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.696
Tiff's canvassing
for witnesses as we speak.

32:10.696 --> 32:11.964
All right, I'll let you know

32:11.964 --> 32:13.599
what we find
on the traffic cams.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.468
<i>There's a good chance they
still have Mrs. Leavins.</i>

32:16.468 --> 32:18.237
They don't.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.471
What?

32:19.471 --> 32:20.872
I just found her body.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.380
She's dead.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.021
All right, folks.

32:35.021 --> 32:36.588
So unfortunately, we were
too late to save Mrs. Leavins.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.324
Scola found her body
outside of a warehouse

32:38.324 --> 32:39.791
in Long Island City.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.460
That is murder number two
for Mr. Cilic,

32:41.460 --> 32:42.995
so let's find
this son of a bitch.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.763
Elise, any luck
finding that gray Jeep?

32:44.763 --> 32:46.165
Just got a hit
on a traffic cam

32:46.165 --> 32:47.633
10 blocks from the warehouse.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.601
Dark gray Jeep, no plates.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.037
That's Cilic.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.004
They're probably
stuck in traffic.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.205
Where are they?

32:53.205 --> 32:54.973
Corner of Lancaster
and Essex,

32:54.973 --> 32:56.375
not far from the 287.

32:56.375 --> 33:00.146
Which leads--
287, straight shot to Canada.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.580
When was the photo
of the Jeep taken?

33:01.580 --> 33:02.914
Two minutes ago.

33:02.914 --> 33:04.316
All right, get our people
over there now.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.861
Hey, there's somebody else
in the car with Cilic.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.796
Let's move in.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.770
FBI, show me your hands!

33:24.770 --> 33:26.072
Let's go.

33:26.072 --> 33:28.174
Shots fired, one down.
Cilic on foot.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.684
Stop! Nobody move.
Up against the wall.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.519
Uh, hold up. He has hostages.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.553
- Inside!
- Yes, yes.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.689
- Move inside!
- Ah. Okay.

33:47.826 --> 33:48.927
Get SWAT down here immediately.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.496
I'll set up a containment.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.500
Okay.
We stay patient, talk him down.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.902
Make sure he doesn't
release this damn virus.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.779
The suspect is still holed up
in a video installation room.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.848
NYPD is on the perimeter.
- Hostages?

34:09.848 --> 34:11.383
Yeah, but we're not sure
how many.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.319
Working on getting a visual
inside the room as we speak.

34:13.319 --> 34:14.520
Command center
is operational?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.088
It's in the lobby.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.827
I just got inside using the
building's security cameras.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.562
- How many hostages?
- Four.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.996
- Any audio?
- No.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.032
But the gallery
has a PA system,

34:27.032 --> 34:28.200
so I was thinking maybe
that's the way

34:28.200 --> 34:29.668
we could make contact
with Cilic.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.603
I don't think this guy's
the negotiating type.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.339
I agree,
but he's got four hostages.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.606
We have to try.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.007
Jubal, are you
getting this feed?

34:36.007 --> 34:37.976
Yeah, we got it.

34:42.948 --> 34:45.851
He's losing it,
feeling trapped.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.353
Let's try and lower the
temperature, calm him down.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.621
Right. All right.
Maggie, try to make contact.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.390
But have SWAT mustered
by the door

34:51.390 --> 34:52.658
in case he doesn't engage.

34:52.658 --> 34:53.925
They're already in place.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.668
Luca Cilic, my name
is Maggie Bell.

35:02.668 --> 35:05.036
I'm with the FBI.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.905
You're surrounded.

35:06.905 --> 35:09.641
This is over.

35:09.641 --> 35:13.212
I need you to drop the gun
and let these people go.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.415
No. Nothing's over!

35:16.415 --> 35:18.184
You want me to shoot, huh?

35:18.184 --> 35:19.518
Make these people dead?

35:19.518 --> 35:21.520
No, no.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.656
No, I want
every single person alive.

35:24.656 --> 35:28.860
So please,
help me make that happen.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.696
No.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.464
You do what I say.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.401
I want a jet,

35:35.401 --> 35:37.636
one capable
of flying long distances.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.206
That's never gonna happen.

35:40.206 --> 35:43.642
<i>I'm telling you
right now, it's over.</i>

35:43.642 --> 35:46.278
<i>So this needs
to end peacefully.</i>

35:46.278 --> 35:48.547
Peacefully?

35:48.547 --> 35:53.118
There can be no peace,
not for my people.

35:53.118 --> 35:57.223
Luca, this virus
that you have

35:57.223 --> 35:58.457
is incredibly dangerous,

35:58.457 --> 36:00.192
and if you accidentally
release it,

36:00.192 --> 36:03.395
people all over the world
are going to die.

36:03.395 --> 36:06.732
<i>That includes the people
that you love and care about.</i>

36:06.732 --> 36:08.500
You're wrong.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.536
I have the vaccine.

36:10.536 --> 36:14.840
No, the vaccine
isn't even functional yet.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.209
It doesn't matter.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.411
The virus is like a bomb.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.380
<i>It gives us power--</i>

36:21.380 --> 36:23.549
<i>power to make demands.</i>

36:23.549 --> 36:25.817
<i>So get me that jet...</i>

36:27.686 --> 36:31.323
Or I'll release the virus,
here and now.

36:39.998 --> 36:41.166
We've gotta move now.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.668
Yeah, Maggie,
have them make entry.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.903
We need to secure the virus
before he tampers with it.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.575
The door is easy.
The gallery just gave us a key.

36:49.575 --> 36:50.876
But with that many hostages,
there's gonna be

36:50.876 --> 36:52.478
a lot of confusion,
people running for cover.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.145
That means line of fire issues.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.581
Okay,
then let's deploy flashbangs,

36:55.581 --> 36:57.383
knock them on their asses,
including the hostages.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.617
If he still aggresses us?

36:58.617 --> 36:59.985
Then we take them out
and pray that

36:59.985 --> 37:01.353
none of the hostages get caught
in the crossfire.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.554
Copy that.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.790
Sound the cart, then bang.

37:27.212 --> 37:29.247
Scola, Tiff, suspect down.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.249
At your six.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.151
Check his pulse.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.060
- He's dead.
- And the virus?

37:48.734 --> 37:50.201
All good.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.937
It's still sealed.

37:54.540 --> 37:57.643
Thank God.

37:57.643 --> 37:58.877
<i>The virus is secure.</i>

38:01.179 --> 38:02.581
All right.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.015
Let's evacuate the hostages
and secure the building.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.251
Yeah. Uh, good--good work.

38:06.251 --> 38:07.553
Get those hostages clear

38:07.553 --> 38:09.721
and let Hazmat handle it
from here.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.062
What's going on?
Did you find Cilic, the virus?

38:19.365 --> 38:21.066
Yes.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.468
The threat
has been neutralized,

38:22.468 --> 38:25.571
and the virus
and vaccine are now secure.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.639
That's good news.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.408
What about my wife?
Where is she?

38:29.408 --> 38:30.976
Is everything okay?

38:33.011 --> 38:35.381
Your wife is dead.

38:38.817 --> 38:42.120
I am very sorry.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.822
What do you mean she's dead?

38:45.424 --> 38:48.694
The moment
you gave Cilic the virus,

38:48.694 --> 38:50.729
his associate killed her.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.969
What?

38:57.969 --> 39:02.774
You lied to me about
my wife being alive?

39:05.377 --> 39:07.746
What kind of person
does something like that?

39:09.347 --> 39:13.419
I am very sorry
for your loss.

39:13.419 --> 39:14.720
Go to hell!

39:32.871 --> 39:35.941
Hey, you have a second?

39:35.941 --> 39:38.610
Yeah. Yeah, come in.

39:38.610 --> 39:43.214
Um, I just wanted to come in
here and clear the air a bit.

39:45.183 --> 39:49.588
Look, I--I know
why we did what we did today.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.790
But what?

39:53.258 --> 39:55.427
But I don't feel good
about it.

39:55.427 --> 39:58.530
Maggie, it's over.

40:02.868 --> 40:06.738
It was my choice
to lie to him, not yours.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.340
So your conscience
should be clean.

40:10.842 --> 40:11.943
Hmm.

40:23.755 --> 40:27.425
Are-are you, uh, coming
to the get-together tonight?

40:27.425 --> 40:28.727
No.

40:28.727 --> 40:31.396
No, uh, I'm headed
to a Knicks game.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.893
Ready for another?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.862
Yeah.
