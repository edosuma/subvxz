01:12.554 --> 01:14.855
Hey, man. Can I get
two vodka sodas, please?

01:14.857 --> 01:16.489
Sure.

01:16.491 --> 01:18.425
Thank you.
You know what?

01:18.427 --> 01:19.860
Go ahead and keep that
for yourself, all right?

01:19.862 --> 01:21.164
Oh, thanks, man.

01:24.066 --> 01:26.670
Yeah, I can't wait
to meet you, too, Madison.

01:27.503 --> 01:29.838
Oh, those babies are legit.

01:31.739 --> 01:32.741
Jeremy?

01:35.912 --> 01:36.913
Uh, no, sorry.

01:38.246 --> 01:40.748
- But this is you, isn't it?
- Well, yeah,

01:40.750 --> 01:42.251
- but you can't be...
- Yeah, Madison.

01:42.918 --> 01:44.420
Yeah, I am.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.621
Joke! Oh, my God.

01:47.623 --> 01:48.922
- You should see your face.
- Oh, my God.

01:48.924 --> 01:50.391
- No, obviously I'm not her.
- Okay. Oh, man.

01:50.393 --> 01:52.359
- No. 'Course I'm not Madison.
- Thank Christ!

01:52.361 --> 01:54.193
Because honestly
I was shitting myself there.

01:54.195 --> 01:55.261
I mean, no offense.

01:55.263 --> 01:56.431
Oh, none taken.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.032
It's really risky
meeting people online.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.565
You never know if people
are gonna be as ugly

01:59.567 --> 02:00.967
on the outside
as they are on the inside.

02:00.969 --> 02:03.103
- Yeah, right, exactly.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:03.105 --> 02:05.038
I'm sorry,
is Madison on her way?

02:05.040 --> 02:06.973
Uh, no, no, no.
Madison's not coming.

02:06.975 --> 02:08.207
What? Why?

02:08.209 --> 02:09.276
Well, she sent me to see

02:09.277 --> 02:11.044
if you were truly
in love with her

02:11.045 --> 02:13.014
and clearly you're not,
so goodbye, Jeremy.

02:13.016 --> 02:14.380
Wait! No, no, no, wait.

02:14.382 --> 02:15.815
Of course I love her.

02:15.817 --> 02:18.285
I have been texting with her
for, like, a frigging month!

02:18.287 --> 02:21.454
This is the girl that I'm
gonna let keep my babies

02:21.456 --> 02:23.925
and I will pay her
her due child support.

02:23.927 --> 02:26.293
I will visit
every other weekend

02:26.295 --> 02:28.662
and say hi to the kids
and put 'em on my lap

02:28.664 --> 02:30.731
and whatever you do, okay?

02:30.733 --> 02:33.299
That is how much I love her.
I swear to Christ!

02:33.301 --> 02:36.002
But can you love
her birth defect?

02:36.004 --> 02:38.037
'Course I can.

02:38.039 --> 02:39.472
I mean,
it's on the inside, right?

02:39.474 --> 02:41.034
Like, it's in her brain
or in her heart?

02:44.146 --> 02:48.415
When Madison was born,
she was born with A cups.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.150
- No, but her photos, they...
- Yeah.

02:50.152 --> 02:52.585
What you're looking at there
is expert contouring

02:52.587 --> 02:54.490
and well-placed
chicken cutlets.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.723
She's really a double-A,

02:56.725 --> 02:57.924
if I'm gonna be, like,
honest with you.

02:57.926 --> 02:59.760
A triple-A in some brands.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.495
Basically, if her tits
were batteries,

03:01.497 --> 03:03.064
they'd go into a watch.

03:03.066 --> 03:04.597
That's why she didn't
wanna come here

03:04.599 --> 03:06.833
and meet you in real life.

03:06.835 --> 03:09.036
Well, not until she has
the boob job, anyways.

03:09.038 --> 03:10.436
Wait, she's getting
a boob job?

03:10.438 --> 03:11.805
When is that happening, then?

03:11.807 --> 03:13.240
- In a year.
- A year?

03:13.242 --> 03:15.174
Well, silicone doesn't
just grow on trees.

03:15.176 --> 03:17.310
- She has to save up.
- Well, how much does she need?

03:17.312 --> 03:19.046
Just, like, $300.

03:19.048 --> 03:22.018
500 if she's gonna
go full bouncy castle.

03:22.685 --> 03:23.784
Okay.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.485
You know what?

03:25.487 --> 03:27.054
Tell her I'll give her
the $500.

03:27.056 --> 03:28.489
I just want her to be happy.

03:28.491 --> 03:31.157
- That is so selfless of you.
- I know.

03:31.159 --> 03:32.792
Do you prefer Venmo or PayPal?

03:32.794 --> 03:33.960
Venmo's fine.

03:33.962 --> 03:36.229
That's her!
The fake tit-job bitch!

03:36.231 --> 03:37.330
Get her!

03:37.332 --> 03:38.565
I needed a new scene anyway.

03:38.567 --> 03:39.733
She stole
my money, man!

03:39.735 --> 03:41.737
Move!
Out of my way, come on!

03:43.004 --> 03:44.672
Hey, where do I send
the money?

03:44.674 --> 03:45.808
Go!

03:49.812 --> 03:51.645
Hey, stop that woman!

03:51.647 --> 03:53.682
Hey, you! Stop!

03:58.253 --> 04:00.090
Go after her! Quick!

04:04.325 --> 04:05.991
You let her get away!

04:05.993 --> 04:09.596
Well, at least we didn't
give her $500 first! Idiot.

04:23.512 --> 04:25.848
Trashy dress,
you did it again.

05:25.475 --> 05:26.807
Hmph!

06:12.687 --> 06:14.887
Begone!
You French women are bad luck!

06:18.161 --> 06:21.127
And shave your armpits.
Please.

06:21.129 --> 06:22.663
Well, come on, deal again!

06:22.665 --> 06:25.367
Our apologies, <i>monsieur,</i>
but you are out of credit.

06:28.069 --> 06:30.639
Hold on,
I may have a solution.

06:31.505 --> 06:33.005
How's this for credit?

06:33.007 --> 06:35.308
It's beautiful, <i>monsieur.</i>
But I cannot accept it.

06:35.310 --> 06:36.375
Why the hell not?

06:36.377 --> 06:37.678
I'm afraid

06:37.680 --> 06:39.980
rumor has it that you are
selling your wife's jewels

06:39.982 --> 06:41.382
to bankroll
your gambling debts.

06:41.384 --> 06:43.353
That is an outrageous slur!

06:54.663 --> 06:57.397
Hey. Whiskey.

06:57.399 --> 06:59.065
Uh, excuse me? Excuse me?

06:59.067 --> 07:01.101
How much
are the red ones worth?

07:01.103 --> 07:03.503
- Uh, one thousand.
- And the blue ones?

07:03.505 --> 07:05.505
Five thousand.

07:05.507 --> 07:07.507
I love that game

07:07.509 --> 07:08.776
with the wheel and the ball
and the numbers.

07:08.778 --> 07:10.010
I don't even really know
how to play.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.613
Hello.

07:12.548 --> 07:14.048
Uh, hello.

07:14.050 --> 07:17.784
My name is Mathias Albrecht
von RÃ¼dinger der Kleinzogen

07:17.786 --> 07:19.420
Hindenburg-an-Sohr.
And you are?

07:19.422 --> 07:20.586
- Janet.
- Janet.

07:20.588 --> 07:21.921
What an enchanting name.

07:21.923 --> 07:23.789
You're American, yes?

07:23.791 --> 07:25.394
- Yes.
- I'm Danish.

07:26.295 --> 07:27.961
Like the pastry?

07:27.963 --> 07:30.029
Yeah. Yeah.

07:30.031 --> 07:31.598
So, what brings you
to the South of France?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.601
An airplane.

07:33.435 --> 07:35.235
Yes, and why are you here?

07:35.237 --> 07:37.236
Oh. Well, um...

07:37.238 --> 07:39.707
I thought
I would treat myself.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.274
I just won some money
in the lottery.

07:41.276 --> 07:43.409
Wow. How much did you win?

07:43.411 --> 07:44.644
$87 million!

07:46.415 --> 07:47.747
I'm sorry,
I don't speak foreign.

07:47.749 --> 07:48.751
Janet...

07:49.752 --> 07:51.618
I have something in my pants

07:51.620 --> 07:53.086
that I think
you're going to like.

07:53.088 --> 07:54.423
- Ew.
- No, no, no.

07:56.158 --> 07:57.159
This.

07:57.593 --> 07:58.759
Oh.

07:58.761 --> 08:00.426
This belonged to my dear mama.

08:00.428 --> 08:02.262
- May I?
- Yes.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.930
Sadly, I have to sell it,

08:03.932 --> 08:05.765
'cause it reminds me
too much of her.

08:05.767 --> 08:06.933
Is it valuable?

08:06.935 --> 08:09.769
It's very valuable, yes.
$500,000.

08:09.771 --> 08:11.605
I like it 'cause it's shiny.

08:11.607 --> 08:13.406
And you're in luck.
It's for sale.

08:13.408 --> 08:14.911
That's crazy. I...

08:15.677 --> 08:17.844
Do I have enough here?

08:17.846 --> 08:20.480
- How much is this worth?
- That is a coaster.

08:20.482 --> 08:22.281
And sadly, no, you don't.

08:22.283 --> 08:26.188
But maybe you could pay
the difference in another way?

08:27.689 --> 08:30.490
I have a 9:00
dinner reservation.

08:30.492 --> 08:31.959
As do I.

08:31.961 --> 08:34.429
Well, I have my reputation
to think of.

08:34.929 --> 08:36.596
As do I.

08:36.597 --> 08:38.197
I have a boyfriend.

08:38.198 --> 08:39.666
As do I.

08:39.668 --> 08:40.767
Freeze!

08:40.769 --> 08:41.969
Inspector Desjardins

08:41.971 --> 08:44.102
of Beaumont-Sur-Mer police.
Get up.

08:44.105 --> 08:46.038
Okay.
Who sent you? My wife?

08:46.040 --> 08:47.173
Do you take bribes?

08:47.175 --> 08:48.608
Not you. Her.

08:48.610 --> 08:50.877
- She is under arrest.
- What?

08:50.879 --> 08:55.216
Those chips were stolen
from this pathetic old man.

08:55.218 --> 08:58.050
This woman is
an international con artist.

08:58.052 --> 09:00.286
No, no, no.
She's just a dumb American.

09:00.288 --> 09:02.723
No, it's true.
She lured this man

09:02.725 --> 09:04.557
with the promise
of a private performance

09:04.559 --> 09:07.026
of her college
gymnastics routine.

09:07.028 --> 09:08.130
Here.

09:10.532 --> 09:11.698
Hmm?

09:11.700 --> 09:13.220
Now,
give back the bracelet.

09:31.186 --> 09:33.387
It would take
an expert to spot the fake.

09:33.389 --> 09:34.724
- Or his wife.
- Hmm.

09:35.490 --> 09:37.092
Thank you, Albert,

09:37.859 --> 09:39.658
for everything.

09:39.660 --> 09:42.195
Excellent research, Brigitte.
The mark was perfect.

09:42.197 --> 09:43.329
As you always say...

09:43.331 --> 09:45.732
You can't cheat an honest man.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.434
Now, I have a buyer in Zurich,

09:47.436 --> 09:49.405
so I shall see you
in a few days. <i>Au revoir.</i>

10:06.955 --> 10:08.254
- Oh.
- Oh!

10:10.558 --> 10:11.961
Sorry. Comin' through.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.229
I'll take the filet mignon.

10:17.231 --> 10:18.400
Very good, sir.

10:23.004 --> 10:24.439
Is this seat taken?

10:25.874 --> 10:27.174
I'm starving.

10:27.176 --> 10:29.944
I could murder a triple
cheeseburger right now.

10:29.946 --> 10:30.947
Or...

10:36.485 --> 10:39.286
I'll just get
a glass of water, please.

10:39.288 --> 10:41.722
- Is that all, madam?
- Yeah, that's it.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.427
I'll just help myself
to the sugar packets.

10:45.326 --> 10:46.493
They're free, right?

10:46.495 --> 10:47.964
- Yes.
- Yeah.

10:52.268 --> 10:53.469
Mmm.

10:58.539 --> 11:00.073
That'll fill me up.

11:00.075 --> 11:01.507
I've to save all my money

11:01.509 --> 11:02.977
'cause I'm here
to find my sister.

11:02.979 --> 11:04.146
This is her.

11:05.615 --> 11:07.446
- That is your sister?
- Half-sister.

11:07.448 --> 11:08.882
But we're like sisters.

11:08.884 --> 11:10.483
- What's happened to her?
- She's been taken.

11:10.485 --> 11:11.685
Taken? Like...

11:11.687 --> 11:15.022
Like by men who sell
hot white virgins

11:15.024 --> 11:17.324
to evil, bearded
kajillionaires on yachts.

11:17.326 --> 11:19.092
- Really?
- The whole irony is,

11:19.094 --> 11:20.627
it was her friend she was with

11:20.629 --> 11:22.228
who was the massive slut.
Tiffany.

11:22.230 --> 11:23.564
Tiffany is the slut?

11:23.566 --> 11:26.467
So, I roughed up these guys,
and they said to me,

11:26.469 --> 11:30.203
"Premium-grade Australian
meat on auction tomorrow."

11:30.205 --> 11:32.305
That fits my sister's
description perfectly,

11:32.307 --> 11:33.773
- don't you think?
- Yes.

11:33.775 --> 11:35.542
So, I'm gonna get on that boat
and buy her back.

11:35.544 --> 11:38.445
Look, I am very moved
by your story.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.379
- Order anything you like.
- No, no, no.

11:40.381 --> 11:41.480
- Please, no?
- No!

11:41.482 --> 11:42.983
- Please, no?
- No, I couldn't.

11:42.985 --> 11:44.486
Please, I insist.

11:46.721 --> 11:49.821
I'll have a club sandwich,
and an order of fries,

11:49.823 --> 11:51.324
order of onion rings,

11:51.326 --> 11:55.329
I'll take the shrimp cocktail.
Is that good? How fresh is it?

11:55.331 --> 11:58.297
What's the soup of the day?
Is it cold? 'Cause, ew, gross.

11:58.299 --> 12:00.300
That's disgusting.
Why have cold soup?

12:00.302 --> 12:01.701
Just give me a Caesar salad.

12:01.703 --> 12:03.570
And then two slices of cake.

12:03.572 --> 12:05.305
- Do you want any cake?
- No.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.705
Three slices of cake
and a Diet Coke.

12:06.707 --> 12:07.876
Thank you.

12:11.879 --> 12:13.747
Will this
be satisfactory, miss?

12:13.749 --> 12:14.848
Yes, this will do.

12:14.850 --> 12:16.416
Once again, I apologize

12:16.418 --> 12:17.983
for the flickering lights
in coach.

12:17.985 --> 12:20.188
Epilepsy is a cruel mistress.

12:22.323 --> 12:23.458
Thank you.

12:28.363 --> 12:30.366
- Hey.
- Hello.

12:34.702 --> 12:37.271
Forgive me, but I couldn't
help but overhear

12:37.273 --> 12:39.039
your conversation
in the dining car.

12:39.041 --> 12:40.573
- My condolences.
- Hmm?

12:40.575 --> 12:42.842
About your sister's
treacherous predicament.

12:42.844 --> 12:44.180
Oh. She'll be all right.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.218
Hmm.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.551
Do you mind if I ask

12:52.553 --> 12:54.854
how long your sister's been
held against her will?

12:54.856 --> 12:56.690
Oh. Listen, um...

12:56.692 --> 12:58.057
Josephine Chesterfield.

12:58.059 --> 12:59.291
Penny Rust.

12:59.293 --> 13:00.392
Delighted.

13:00.394 --> 13:01.927
Eh, what's up?

13:01.929 --> 13:04.464
Uh, listen, I think this is
gonna be a really long ride

13:04.466 --> 13:06.934
and clearly you're, like,
an exhausting person.

13:06.936 --> 13:08.602
So, I'm just gonna say this.

13:08.604 --> 13:10.436
I don't even have a sister.

13:10.438 --> 13:12.439
Are you saying
you lied to that man?

13:12.441 --> 13:14.340
I don't wanna
say it too loudly.

13:14.342 --> 13:16.111
I'm a con artist.

13:17.145 --> 13:18.579
I con.

13:18.581 --> 13:20.379
But that man
was so kind to you,

13:20.381 --> 13:21.647
and he bought your dinner.

13:21.649 --> 13:24.283
Only after I showed him
a picture of a hot chick.

13:24.285 --> 13:26.119
See, women have feelings.

13:26.121 --> 13:29.791
So, like, you just
had sympathy or pity,

13:30.893 --> 13:32.892
or, I don't know,
the other feeling

13:32.894 --> 13:36.296
and men see that quality in us
and exploit us.

13:36.298 --> 13:38.632
So all I'm doin' is, like...

13:38.634 --> 13:41.733
<i>âª Put that thing down
Flip it and reverse it âª</i>

13:41.735 --> 13:43.770
And then I'm now
exploiting them.

13:43.772 --> 13:45.839
Are there many women
in your industry?

13:45.841 --> 13:48.273
Uh... Sisters in arms,
as it were?

13:48.275 --> 13:51.344
Well, not at my level, no.

13:51.346 --> 13:53.179
Yes, clearly you're in a class
of your own.

13:53.181 --> 13:55.248
Oh! Except,
of course there's Medusa.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.315
Oh?

13:56.317 --> 13:58.017
She's like the O.G. lady
con artist.

13:58.019 --> 13:59.886
People say she could
freeze a man's assets

13:59.888 --> 14:01.253
with just one look.

14:01.255 --> 14:02.922
Well...

14:02.924 --> 14:05.959
My horizons have certainly
been expanded this evening.

14:05.961 --> 14:07.661
Where will the wind
take you next?

14:07.663 --> 14:09.963
I'm going to this town
on the Med,

14:09.965 --> 14:11.198
Beaumont-Sur-Mer.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.100
Get this, apparently it's
crawling with rich dudes.

14:14.102 --> 14:15.767
Well, I'm afraid
you've been misinformed.

14:15.769 --> 14:18.503
You see,
I live in Beaumont-Sur-Mer

14:18.505 --> 14:20.772
and I think you'll find
it's a lesbian community.

14:20.774 --> 14:22.342
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

14:22.344 --> 14:24.276
Honestly, you'd do better
staying on to Portofino.

14:24.278 --> 14:26.879
Well, maybe I could
work a woman.

14:26.881 --> 14:28.147
I don't know how you...

14:28.149 --> 14:29.882
Yeah, I could give it a go.

14:29.884 --> 14:32.020
But isn't your philosophy
based on exploiting men?

14:33.355 --> 14:35.287
Penny? Penny.

14:35.289 --> 14:37.323
Sorry, were you... Sorry.

14:37.325 --> 14:40.127
I was just playing this game
on my phone.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.228
Yes, of course.

14:42.230 --> 14:43.496
I just have to call my mother

14:43.498 --> 14:45.299
to let them know
what time to expect me.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.301
Please.

14:56.578 --> 14:58.011
So, do you have
a car here?

14:58.013 --> 14:59.412
I do.

14:59.414 --> 15:01.547
Oh, great. Do you mind if I,
like, scab a lift off you?

15:01.549 --> 15:02.648
What?

15:02.650 --> 15:04.150
You leaving the party already?

15:04.152 --> 15:05.754
Afraid so. Cheerio.

15:09.524 --> 15:10.924
Penny?

15:10.926 --> 15:13.158
Did you say Portofino
was the next stop?

15:13.160 --> 15:15.929
Yo, Portofino is
going to be turnt!

15:19.235 --> 15:20.767
What?

15:20.769 --> 15:23.169
I don't know
what you just said,

15:23.171 --> 15:24.570
but the answer is <i>oui.</i>

15:50.097 --> 15:51.931
How was last night?

15:51.933 --> 15:53.767
It was all I could arrange
on such short notice.

15:53.769 --> 15:56.603
Jean and Lil Baguette
were perfect.

15:56.605 --> 15:58.238
May I ask the reason
for their involvement?

15:58.240 --> 16:00.140
I encountered
a sort of pale gypsy

16:00.142 --> 16:02.041
who thought herself
something of a grifter.

16:02.043 --> 16:03.944
Surely she was
no match for you?

16:03.946 --> 16:06.445
Hmm, one can never be
too careful, Brigitte.

16:06.447 --> 16:07.980
A poacher
who shoots at rabbits

16:07.982 --> 16:09.748
may scare big game away.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.383
Speaking of...

16:11.385 --> 16:14.921
Next we have Gregor Gregorsky.

16:14.923 --> 16:17.089
Made his fortune
in office supplies,

16:17.091 --> 16:18.925
married four times.

16:18.927 --> 16:20.627
He's a romantic.

16:20.629 --> 16:24.966
And he should be arriving...
now.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.440
Who is that with him?

16:33.442 --> 16:37.444
You must save your beautiful
sister before she is defiled.

16:37.446 --> 16:39.579
I know,
'cause once she is defiled,

16:39.581 --> 16:41.681
she's, like, less special,
don't you reckon?

16:41.683 --> 16:42.684
Brigitte.

16:43.351 --> 16:45.184
Right away.

16:45.186 --> 16:50.757
Gregor, you have no idea
what this money will do.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.891
Hit it, Marcel!

16:53.794 --> 16:55.697
I'm flying!

16:57.032 --> 16:58.300
Oh, shit!

17:01.836 --> 17:02.935
Hey!

17:19.488 --> 17:21.323
<i>Merci.</i>

17:22.124 --> 17:23.355
Mmm, mmm.

17:23.357 --> 17:25.727
All right.
Let's go, boys, one more time!

17:40.240 --> 17:41.908
You want to press charges?

17:41.910 --> 17:43.142
<i>Da.</i>

17:43.144 --> 17:45.948
Her sister is probably
not even virgin.

17:55.190 --> 17:57.055
He gave me the money!

17:57.057 --> 17:59.094
What laws
have I actually broken?

18:03.765 --> 18:04.767
Oh.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.236
Contraction. Mmm.

18:09.238 --> 18:12.041
The stress
is not good for the baby.

18:12.773 --> 18:14.242
Ooh, my little baby.

18:15.874 --> 18:16.342
Ooh.

18:16.344 --> 18:17.811
We are a tight-knit community

18:17.813 --> 18:19.411
in Beaumont-Sur-Mer,
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

18:19.413 --> 18:21.681
We do not want your kind here.

18:21.683 --> 18:22.683
What?

18:23.786 --> 18:25.651
Oh, yeah, yeah, right, yeah.

18:25.653 --> 18:29.555
I've heard about
your little community.

18:29.557 --> 18:32.461
And that's...
That's actually why I came.

18:34.429 --> 18:38.030
To do some, like,
experimenting.

18:38.032 --> 18:39.097
You know...

18:39.099 --> 18:40.168
Ooh!

18:42.604 --> 18:43.806
Ooh.

18:47.142 --> 18:48.811
Oh, no, wrong thing.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.777
Inspector?

18:51.779 --> 18:53.982
Don't you think we can just
work something out?

18:56.050 --> 18:57.885
Just between us girls?

19:01.824 --> 19:03.926
I don't date pregnant women.

19:09.163 --> 19:11.331
Oh, wait! Actually, um,
I know somebody here!

19:11.333 --> 19:13.400
You know someone
in Beaumont-Sur-Mer?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.102
Yeah, yeah.
I bet you'd know her, too.

19:15.104 --> 19:17.769
She's, like, really rich,
really important.

19:17.771 --> 19:20.640
She looks like a librarian's
corpse, only less lively.

19:20.642 --> 19:22.775
She would have
your ass for this.

19:22.777 --> 19:24.177
Oh, I see.

19:24.179 --> 19:25.444
What's her name?

19:25.446 --> 19:26.647
- Oh, her name...
- Mmm-hmm?

19:28.916 --> 19:31.086
...is Joanna...

19:31.752 --> 19:32.818
Regina.

19:32.820 --> 19:36.024
Regina Charleston.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.661
It's Charlotte...

19:40.194 --> 19:42.827
Pemberton.

19:42.829 --> 19:45.033
It's Pamela. Pernilla.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.933
Pendy Simmons.

19:47.935 --> 19:49.869
No, wait, it's...

19:49.871 --> 19:51.470
Janet Maxfield.

19:51.472 --> 19:53.305
Ha! Charlotte Josephson.

19:53.307 --> 19:54.841
Josephine Chesterfield?

19:54.843 --> 19:56.609
Yeah, that is her!

19:56.611 --> 19:58.344
We should...
We should call her.

19:58.346 --> 20:00.479
Get her on the line.

20:00.481 --> 20:03.283
Tell her to
set me free, please!

20:07.689 --> 20:11.724
Penny, the charges against you
aren't very serious,

20:11.726 --> 20:13.325
but it appears
Inspector Desjardins

20:13.327 --> 20:15.564
is keeping you here
for your own protection.

20:16.564 --> 20:17.997
From what?

20:17.999 --> 20:19.231
The man you swindled

20:19.233 --> 20:21.000
is a prominent figure
of the Russian mafia.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.067
Shit.

20:22.069 --> 20:23.169
If you were to be released,

20:23.171 --> 20:24.470
you would
most certainly be killed,

20:24.472 --> 20:25.604
or worse.

20:25.606 --> 20:27.172
Well, there has to be
another option!

20:27.174 --> 20:28.874
One moment.

20:38.185 --> 20:39.187
<i>Oui.</i>

20:41.522 --> 20:44.092
Penny, what do you have on you
by way of liquidity?

20:44.559 --> 20:46.258
Uh...

20:46.260 --> 20:50.028
I think I have a travel-size
K-Y Jelly in my bag.

20:50.030 --> 20:51.396
It's peach-flavored.

20:51.398 --> 20:54.566
Cash, Penny. How much cash
do you have at your disposal?

20:54.568 --> 20:59.104
I have about 10 or 8...
Yeah, $8,000.

20:59.106 --> 21:01.607
That might be enough to get you out
of the country, but you must promise

21:01.609 --> 21:04.544
never ever,
under any circumstances,

21:04.546 --> 21:06.513
to come back
to Beaumont-Sur-Mer

21:06.515 --> 21:08.081
ever again.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.016
- Pinky promise.
- Hold on, Penny.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.254
The nightmare is almost over.

21:14.588 --> 21:17.123
Hey, listen,

21:17.125 --> 21:19.558
- I may have been a bit of bitch when we first met.
- Oh.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.594
And when I talked about you
behind your back.

21:21.596 --> 21:23.198
- Hmm?
- And when I posted this.

21:25.767 --> 21:27.366
- Huh.
- But you did me a solid

21:27.368 --> 21:28.535
getting me out of jail,

21:28.537 --> 21:31.038
so I think
you're a pretty top chick.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.941
Try to be as inconspicuous
as possible.

21:35.943 --> 21:37.476
I know it's difficult for you,

21:37.478 --> 21:40.883
but it's better to go
unnoticed by Gregor's henchmen.

21:46.554 --> 21:48.487
<i>Au revoir.</i>

21:48.489 --> 21:51.093
Well, I don't get
what that means.

21:56.096 --> 21:58.500
Yo, I'm just gonna
blend in with you guys.

22:31.365 --> 22:32.832
Hey.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.132
Oh!

22:34.134 --> 22:36.102
Dude! What are you...

22:36.104 --> 22:38.537
You can't just sneak up
on a lady like that!

22:41.275 --> 22:43.879
Hmm. You're not
really my type...

22:46.548 --> 22:48.180
But the pilot's busy, so...

22:55.190 --> 22:56.323
Let's just make this quick.

22:56.325 --> 22:58.056
I feel like they're about
to serve the meal.

22:58.058 --> 22:59.459
- Where is it?
- What?

22:59.461 --> 23:00.526
Where is it?

23:00.528 --> 23:02.461
Hey...

23:02.463 --> 23:05.164
Nazi Gollum, you're gonna
have to speak more clearly.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.833
- Where is it?
- What?

23:06.835 --> 23:09.969
I saw you talking with her
in the airport.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.303
Josephine?

23:11.305 --> 23:12.404
Is that her real name?

23:12.406 --> 23:14.172
- Are you with her?
- Um...

23:14.174 --> 23:16.910
No, I think maybe
the police chick is?

23:16.912 --> 23:18.378
They could just be friends.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.046
I don't know.
It's hard to tell nowadays.

23:20.048 --> 23:21.680
So, the police woman's
part of it?

23:21.682 --> 23:23.719
- Part of what?
- The hustle!

23:24.318 --> 23:25.383
Hmm?

23:25.385 --> 23:27.553
She stole my wife's
diamond bracelet!

23:27.555 --> 23:29.024
It's worth
half a million dollars!

23:31.259 --> 23:32.491
Shit the bed.

23:32.493 --> 23:34.994
And now my wife
is filing for divorce.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.830
Are you working
with her or not?

23:36.832 --> 23:38.029
No! No, no.

23:39.534 --> 23:40.766
Um...

23:40.768 --> 23:44.237
No, I'm actually
working for ASSES.

23:44.239 --> 23:45.304
What?

23:45.306 --> 23:47.507
ASSES? Have you not
heard of that?

23:47.509 --> 23:52.510
It's the, um,
Australian Securities Services

23:52.512 --> 23:56.216
Intelligently Spying.

23:56.218 --> 23:58.851
- Don't you mean ASIO?
- No.

23:58.853 --> 24:00.186
No, they're wankers.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.253
ASSES.

24:01.255 --> 24:02.587
It's the place to be.

24:02.589 --> 24:04.591
And I'm deep, deep,
deep in ASSES.

24:04.593 --> 24:06.459
I'm trying to
bring her to justice.

24:06.461 --> 24:07.793
- Okay, good.
- Yeah.

24:07.795 --> 24:09.429
Good. How can I help?

24:09.431 --> 24:11.029
Well, sir, um...

24:11.031 --> 24:13.600
I believe we should
start by having sex

24:13.602 --> 24:14.769
as a cover.

24:22.911 --> 24:23.911
What was that?

24:25.145 --> 24:26.711
I have standards.

24:26.713 --> 24:28.314
As do I.

24:28.316 --> 24:29.481
I need to take a nap.

24:29.483 --> 24:30.985
As do I.

24:33.153 --> 24:34.789
I have many STDs, so...

24:37.724 --> 24:38.993
As do I.

24:56.010 --> 24:57.442
Mesdames et messieurs,

24:57.444 --> 24:59.045
<i>please fasten your seat belts.</i>

24:59.047 --> 25:02.384
<i>We are experiencing some
unexpected turbulence.</i>

25:32.313 --> 25:34.216
Phew!

25:36.683 --> 25:38.484
My quads are burning!

25:38.486 --> 25:39.951
Ow! Ow!

25:39.953 --> 25:42.153
Bloody hell!
No. Okay.

25:45.826 --> 25:47.293
Oh, yeah.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.430
I'm gonna puke.

25:49.663 --> 25:52.664
I'm gonna hold it.
I can hold it.

25:52.666 --> 25:55.301
- Penny.
- Hello, Janet.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.701
Or should I say...

25:56.703 --> 25:58.673
Medusa?

26:00.208 --> 26:03.008
- I am not Medusa.
- Really?

26:03.010 --> 26:05.247
Take this to the guestroom,
butlery person.

26:10.884 --> 26:12.384
Okay, I may need to borrow

26:12.386 --> 26:15.555
a toothbrush, leggings,
some thongs.

26:15.557 --> 26:16.655
Oh! Some "going out" thongs.

26:16.657 --> 26:18.324
Do we have a problem?

26:18.326 --> 26:22.194
Ah! Captain Pantsuit,
in on it as well?

26:22.196 --> 26:25.330
All wrapped up
in this kebab of lies?

26:25.332 --> 26:27.667
Everything is fine, Brigitte.
You and Albert may go.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.934
Yeah. Bye, girls.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.404
I'll take my lunch
by the pool!

26:32.406 --> 26:35.106
Just letting you know,
I'm salad intolerant.

26:35.108 --> 26:36.875
What do you want,
Penny?

26:36.877 --> 26:38.376
I want this!

26:38.378 --> 26:40.345
Like, look at this place!

26:40.347 --> 26:43.449
I had no idea how small-time
I was until I met you.

26:43.451 --> 26:45.617
Teach me your sugar baby ways.

26:45.619 --> 26:46.719
Shape me

26:46.721 --> 26:48.621
into something great

26:48.623 --> 26:49.857
and richer.

26:50.791 --> 26:51.891
And why would I do that?

26:51.893 --> 26:53.191
Because who knows?

26:53.193 --> 26:55.026
I could be the partner
you never knew you needed.

26:55.028 --> 26:57.028
- No, thanks. I work alone.
- Hello?

26:57.030 --> 27:00.365
What about Menswear Barbie
and Old Crone Ken?

27:00.367 --> 27:01.602
They are employees.

27:02.303 --> 27:04.039
Okay. I get it.

27:06.606 --> 27:09.776
But what you're not getting
is that a girl like me

27:09.778 --> 27:11.375
could make it
real uncomfortable

27:11.377 --> 27:13.046
for you in this town.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.546
Like a bad case of the herp.

27:14.548 --> 27:17.150
With the right vitamin
cocktail, you'll go away.

27:17.152 --> 27:20.151
You do know herpes never
goes away, don't you?

27:20.153 --> 27:21.423
Doesn't it?

27:23.156 --> 27:24.158
No.

27:27.095 --> 27:30.129
Seems like you've set up
such deep roots here.

27:30.131 --> 27:33.134
It'd be such a shame for it
to all be seized by Interpol.

27:34.001 --> 27:35.470
It'd just take one phone call.

27:43.478 --> 27:44.610
Hello, Interpol?

27:44.612 --> 27:45.680
Tell me, Penny...

27:47.915 --> 27:50.652
Why are women better suited
to the con than men?

27:52.086 --> 27:54.754
'Cause we're used to
faking it?

27:54.756 --> 27:58.190
It comes down
to one universal truth.

27:58.192 --> 28:01.328
No man will ever believe
a woman is smarter than he is.

28:02.864 --> 28:04.963
We will always
be underestimated

28:04.965 --> 28:06.800
and that is what we use.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.934
So this means you're gonna
teach me, aren't you?

28:09.936 --> 28:11.202
I'm teaching you now.

28:11.204 --> 28:12.270
Yes!

28:12.272 --> 28:14.139
Wait, what was that last part?

28:14.141 --> 28:16.378
I couldn't hear. You were
talking into the ocean.

28:18.278 --> 28:19.879
What do men want?

28:19.881 --> 28:21.846
- Boobs.
- No.

28:21.848 --> 28:22.850
Back door.

28:24.318 --> 28:25.383
Front door.

28:25.385 --> 28:26.818
Pegging or, like, a threesome.

28:26.820 --> 28:28.187
What is it? What's the answer?

28:28.189 --> 28:30.523
They want to be heroes.

28:30.525 --> 28:32.224
There is nothing
more compelling to a man

28:32.226 --> 28:33.726
than a vulnerable woman.

28:33.728 --> 28:35.697
Observe.

28:41.502 --> 28:44.402
Oh, wow. You can just
tear up like that.

28:44.404 --> 28:47.206
You can just balance a tear
right on that lower lid.

28:47.208 --> 28:49.978
And can you make the tear
roll down your cheek?

28:51.244 --> 28:53.613
Oh. Oh. Okay.

28:53.615 --> 28:55.683
But can you make it
go back up?

28:57.318 --> 28:59.287
- Now, you try.
- Okay.

29:09.096 --> 29:10.395
- Are you constipated?
- No.

29:10.397 --> 29:12.898
Why all the theatrics?
You're hot. That's enough.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.065
It is not enough.

29:14.067 --> 29:15.767
"Hot" is not a career.

29:15.769 --> 29:17.769
"Hot" will get you gifts
and trinkets,

29:17.771 --> 29:19.406
but you must pay for them
in other ways.

29:20.708 --> 29:22.373
Sex, Penny.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.610
<i>Lesson two, research.</i>

29:24.612 --> 29:26.578
"The Suburban White Knight."

29:26.580 --> 29:28.613
This one calls
for a basic rescue scam.

29:28.615 --> 29:29.716
A staged drowning

29:29.718 --> 29:31.683
and resuscitation
usually fits the bill.

29:31.685 --> 29:35.353
Next we have
"The Braggadocio on Holiday."

29:35.355 --> 29:36.855
Just wants a story
to tell the boys.

29:36.857 --> 29:38.056
But careful here.

29:38.058 --> 29:39.859
He's a frequent abuser
of social media.

29:41.229 --> 29:42.295
What the...

29:42.297 --> 29:43.895
Why the...

29:45.031 --> 29:46.965
...headache!

29:46.967 --> 29:49.801
Finally, you must be trained
for any situation.

31:09.517 --> 31:11.217
One, two...

31:11.219 --> 31:12.320
Surprise!

31:14.654 --> 31:16.889
Hello. How do you do?

31:16.891 --> 31:19.357
Yes, isn't it a lovely party?

31:19.359 --> 31:20.726
I know.

31:20.728 --> 31:22.564
I have seven houses.

31:32.874 --> 31:34.006
She's ready.

31:34.008 --> 31:35.340
I'm ready?

31:35.342 --> 31:36.344
Yes!

31:36.978 --> 31:37.978
Whoo!

31:45.486 --> 31:47.420
Ugh. <i>Mon Dieu!</i>

31:47.422 --> 31:48.988
I don't like it.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.058
She represents
everything you despise.

31:52.727 --> 31:55.594
You know, the water level
at the quarry

31:55.596 --> 31:57.763
is higher than normal
this time of year.

31:57.765 --> 31:59.064
They would not find her body

31:59.066 --> 32:00.231
- until the spring.
- Hmm.

32:00.233 --> 32:01.834
Just say the word,

32:01.836 --> 32:04.737
or don't and you maintain
your innocence,

32:04.739 --> 32:07.239
and I will do it anyway.

32:07.241 --> 32:08.407
Nonsense.

32:08.409 --> 32:10.008
We're taking her in gracefully

32:10.010 --> 32:12.277
in order to
get her out gracefully.

32:12.279 --> 32:13.679
Was that the word?

32:13.681 --> 32:15.113
"Gracefully"?

32:15.115 --> 32:17.182
Trust me, Brigitte.
It'll all work out in our favor.

32:17.184 --> 32:21.821
With Penny, we can finally run
the "Lord of the Rings" play.

32:21.823 --> 32:24.789
You truly believe she is ready
for something so elaborate?

32:24.791 --> 32:26.727
Who's the first mark?

32:28.362 --> 32:29.761
Oh, Howard.

32:29.763 --> 32:31.596
I can't marry you.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.633
Oh...

32:35.635 --> 32:39.103
Now, settle down, cupcake.

32:39.105 --> 32:41.039
What problem's so big
you don't think

32:41.041 --> 32:44.242
Howard Bacon can fix it, huh?

32:44.244 --> 32:47.813
How could you marry a woman
so beneath you?

32:47.815 --> 32:49.849
What are you saying,
snickerdoodle?

32:49.851 --> 32:52.918
You are 63rd in line
to the British throne.

32:52.920 --> 32:56.288
I know, but I'm bankrupt.

32:56.290 --> 32:58.790
The title's all I have left.

32:58.792 --> 33:02.827
Oh, Howard,
do you think me a...

33:02.829 --> 33:04.962
gold digger?

33:07.134 --> 33:09.767
Oh, peanut butter cup.

33:09.769 --> 33:10.902
Now, listen here.

33:10.904 --> 33:12.171
We're gonna get married,

33:12.173 --> 33:13.805
we're gonna fly home
to Fort Worth.

33:13.807 --> 33:15.606
I'mma introduce you
to my golfing buddies

33:15.608 --> 33:17.509
and then when
I run for Senate,

33:17.511 --> 33:19.678
you're gonna be by my side.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.113
Beautiful and silent.

33:22.115 --> 33:25.086
You're not gonna break my heart
now, are you, sugarbooger?

33:25.752 --> 33:27.452
Oh, Howard.

33:27.454 --> 33:31.356
I'm helpless against
your food-themed endearments.

33:31.358 --> 33:33.158
The only thing you're gonna
have to worry about

33:33.160 --> 33:35.594
how that Texas humidity's
gonna affect your hair.

33:35.596 --> 33:38.264
My hair looks like this
in any climate, darling,

33:38.266 --> 33:40.468
and Hortense loves wet heat.

33:41.134 --> 33:42.267
Hortense?

33:42.269 --> 33:45.170
My sister.
Didn't I tell you about her?

33:45.172 --> 33:47.575
I couldn't possibly
leave her behind.

33:49.343 --> 33:50.875
Are you telling me
I'm gonna go home

33:50.877 --> 33:53.011
with two princesses on my arm?

33:53.013 --> 33:54.479
Would you like to see her?

33:54.481 --> 33:56.515
Oh, lead the way.

33:56.517 --> 33:58.284
If you think me
regal in the least,

33:58.286 --> 34:00.719
wait until you meet
my sweet sister. Oof!

34:00.721 --> 34:05.290
I haven't an ounce of the
majesty Hortense possesses.

34:05.292 --> 34:07.392
There are no private beaches
on the Cote d'Azur,

34:07.394 --> 34:11.462
but you put up one sign that
says "toxic waste," <i>et voila!</i>

34:11.464 --> 34:12.998
Granny was so clever.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.299
- Mmm.
- Your sister lives in there?

34:15.301 --> 34:18.937
Mmm-hmm, yes,
in her cozy castle keep.

34:21.174 --> 34:22.873
Ah.

34:22.876 --> 34:24.409
This way.

34:24.411 --> 34:26.077
Your tetanus
is up to date, yes?

34:26.079 --> 34:27.746
What?

34:27.748 --> 34:30.382
Every royal family
has its black sheep, of course,

34:30.384 --> 34:32.351
but not Hortense and me.

34:32.353 --> 34:35.719
Nanny Gertrude raised us to be
two levelheaded young ladies.

34:35.722 --> 34:38.356
We're so normal,
it's practically boring.

34:38.358 --> 34:40.056
Now remember, at no point

34:40.059 --> 34:41.693
should you turn
your back on her.

34:41.695 --> 34:43.364
Because she's royalty?

34:44.364 --> 34:45.864
If you like.

34:45.867 --> 34:47.099
Ah, here we are.

34:47.101 --> 34:49.266
Hortense,
I've brought a guest!

34:49.268 --> 34:50.768
- I wonder where she's hiding.
- Hmm.

34:50.771 --> 34:53.338
Don't be shy.

34:53.340 --> 34:54.608
Oh. I know.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.545
Maybe her subjects
can flush her out.

35:09.556 --> 35:11.255
Ah! There she is!

35:11.257 --> 35:13.726
My only living relative.

35:13.728 --> 35:16.130
Shall we pay her a visit?

35:21.302 --> 35:25.903
Princess Hortense of House
Northumberton-Saxe-Hapsburg,

35:25.905 --> 35:29.476
may I present to you
Howard Bacon.

35:33.114 --> 35:34.246
Uh...

35:34.248 --> 35:36.481
My ma'am... Lady.

35:36.483 --> 35:40.619
Sir Bacon,
welcome to thy kingdom.

35:40.621 --> 35:42.653
I have food for your men

35:42.655 --> 35:45.423
and water
for your horses and whores.

35:45.425 --> 35:46.958
Hortense.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.728
She knows you haven't
got any horses.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.666
Lucretia, pour the mead.

35:56.336 --> 35:57.769
Lucretia,
you dumb bitch,

35:57.771 --> 35:59.170
don't embarrass me
in front of the guests.

35:59.172 --> 36:01.440
Yes, there is much
to celebrate, beloved sister.

36:01.442 --> 36:03.608
I bring wonderful news.

36:03.610 --> 36:05.913
Howard and I
are to be married.

36:06.813 --> 36:07.815
Really?

36:10.318 --> 36:12.684
You and you?

36:12.686 --> 36:13.755
Hortense...

36:16.188 --> 36:18.826
Hortense, do not
drop that coronet.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.096
Use your words,
not the heirlooms.

36:24.164 --> 36:25.264
Whoops!

36:30.637 --> 36:31.769
Why?

36:31.771 --> 36:34.039
I think I know
what this is about.

36:34.041 --> 36:35.673
Die! No!

36:35.675 --> 36:38.376
Don't fret, sissy.
You shan't be left behind.

36:38.378 --> 36:41.280
You, Howard, and I

36:41.282 --> 36:44.849
are going to live together
in Texas.

36:44.851 --> 36:47.519
Texas? Hurrah!

36:47.521 --> 36:50.322
This calls
for a celebration pole dance.

36:55.528 --> 36:58.829
Promise, if anything
should happen to me,

36:58.831 --> 37:00.900
you'll look after her.

37:00.902 --> 37:03.034
Ooh.
I invoke <i>prima nocta.</i>

37:03.036 --> 37:04.369
Absolutely.

37:04.371 --> 37:06.871
This shall be a traditional
wedding in every respect.

37:06.873 --> 37:07.972
<i>Prima nocta.</i>

37:07.974 --> 37:10.541
<i>Prima nocta! Prima nocta!</i>

37:10.543 --> 37:14.045
Uh, what's <i>prima nocta?</i>

37:14.047 --> 37:17.682
Oh. Once the eldest daughter
consummates her marriage,

37:17.684 --> 37:19.918
it is the second daughter's
divine right

37:19.920 --> 37:22.688
either to bed the groom
or fight him in a duel.

37:22.690 --> 37:24.190
In either case,
your performance

37:24.192 --> 37:25.925
shall be judged
by a panel of courtiers.

37:25.927 --> 37:27.858
But you don't mind,
do you, darling?

37:27.860 --> 37:32.530
<i>âª Second sister
Gets sloppy seconds âª</i>

37:32.532 --> 37:35.867
<i>âª Or you die âª</i>

37:38.704 --> 37:40.871
Muffin, wedding's off.

37:40.873 --> 37:42.773
But Howard! The ring!

37:42.775 --> 37:43.777
Keep it!

37:56.523 --> 37:58.655
Enrique, do go on.
You were saying how

37:58.657 --> 38:01.226
even though you yourself have
benefited economically

38:01.228 --> 38:02.594
from immigrating to America,

38:02.596 --> 38:05.063
you don't feel
any additional Guatemalans

38:05.065 --> 38:06.599
should be allowed
into Palm Beach?

38:06.601 --> 38:07.699
Yes, I believe...

38:07.701 --> 38:10.135
Sister! Sister! Sister!

38:10.137 --> 38:12.204
Hortense! Manners, please!

38:12.206 --> 38:14.305
Is this how we behave
in front of a guest?

38:14.307 --> 38:15.543
Sorry.

38:16.275 --> 38:17.541
Pardon the intrusion,

38:17.543 --> 38:19.510
but can I beg leave
to go to the toilet?

38:19.512 --> 38:20.811
Yes, of course,
my turtle dove.

38:20.813 --> 38:22.581
Thank you.

38:22.583 --> 38:26.119
Kind sir, would you help me
with this?

38:28.222 --> 38:29.920
The lock-eth has rust-eth.

38:29.922 --> 38:31.088
Hortense!

38:31.090 --> 38:32.958
Did I not expressly forbid you

38:32.960 --> 38:35.260
from wearing your virtue
panties in the pool?

38:35.262 --> 38:37.431
Albert! She's done it again.

38:38.632 --> 38:40.233
Ahhh! Not the flame!

38:51.978 --> 38:54.179
Release the peasants!

38:54.181 --> 38:56.081
She must mean
"pheasants," yes?

38:56.083 --> 38:57.648
Hmm? Of course not.

38:57.650 --> 39:00.586
Oh, don't worry, darling.
She's a terrible shot.

39:01.822 --> 39:03.124
Peasant ho!

39:05.492 --> 39:06.494
See?

39:14.835 --> 39:16.871
That was unexpected.

39:24.043 --> 39:26.345
Brigitte, your 20,000.

39:26.347 --> 39:28.280
You just got a lot
more attractive, Bridge.

39:28.282 --> 39:29.815
Albert, your 10.

39:29.817 --> 39:31.349
Still wouldn't bang you,
Albert.

39:32.619 --> 39:33.854
Thank you, all.

39:36.356 --> 39:37.889
What do you mean,
"Thank you, all"?

39:37.891 --> 39:39.224
No, where's my cashola?

39:39.226 --> 39:40.391
Hmm? Where's my cut?

39:40.393 --> 39:42.728
Where's the big chunka...

39:42.730 --> 39:44.528
...to come in to me,
of the cash?

39:44.530 --> 39:47.132
The student
doesn't earn wages

39:47.134 --> 39:48.867
until after graduation.

39:48.869 --> 39:51.172
When the hell is that?

39:52.239 --> 39:53.539
I've been killing myself

39:53.541 --> 39:55.139
playing Hortense
the Feral Princess,

39:55.141 --> 39:57.976
while you just prance around,
not having sex with people.

39:57.978 --> 39:59.811
Penny, how much money
do you have?

39:59.813 --> 40:00.815
Be honest, now.

40:02.416 --> 40:04.014
$500,000.

40:04.016 --> 40:05.682
Oh. Good for you.

40:05.684 --> 40:07.517
It's an adorable
little nest egg.

40:07.519 --> 40:08.987
All in cash I presume?

40:08.989 --> 40:11.824
Bitcoin. Why?
How much money do you have?

40:11.826 --> 40:16.764
Hmm? Oh, assets and liquidity,
um, 28.32 million.

40:18.032 --> 40:19.563
Ah, okay, I didn't know

40:19.565 --> 40:21.333
we were counting
assets and liquidity.

40:21.335 --> 40:22.534
In that case, I have, uh...

40:22.536 --> 40:24.401
still 500,000.

40:24.403 --> 40:26.771
And how do you think
I grew that wealth?

40:26.773 --> 40:29.108
By investing wisely.

40:29.110 --> 40:31.008
I've invested in you, Penny.

40:31.010 --> 40:32.543
And I must see a robust return

40:32.545 --> 40:34.079
before I can share
the profits.

40:34.081 --> 40:35.579
But you wouldn't
have any profits

40:35.581 --> 40:37.483
if it wasn't for me, okay?

40:37.485 --> 40:39.251
Let's face it,
we're a team on this.

40:39.253 --> 40:41.920
Penny, if you want to be like
me, then you're going to have...

40:41.922 --> 40:43.521
I don't wanna be like you!

40:43.523 --> 40:45.257
Why would I wanna be like you?

40:45.259 --> 40:47.624
I don't wanna be some loser

40:47.626 --> 40:49.961
that looks like
a colorful Beetlejuice.

40:49.963 --> 40:52.063
Oh, sorry,
Julie Andrews just called.

40:52.065 --> 40:53.965
She said she wants
her voice back.

40:53.967 --> 40:56.266
We all know
you're actually from Wisconsin

40:56.268 --> 40:59.037
and you stay in this house
eating weird salads

40:59.039 --> 41:00.706
and drinking alcohol

41:00.708 --> 41:02.775
that doesn't get you
hammered fast enough.

41:02.777 --> 41:04.142
And you're like,

41:04.144 --> 41:07.278
"Oh! I better check
all my precious stocks

41:07.280 --> 41:09.546
on the NASCAR index."

41:09.548 --> 41:10.916
And, "Oh, wait,

41:10.918 --> 41:14.318
let me just collect another
little boy's head,

41:14.320 --> 41:18.289
or another dinosaur clitoris,

41:18.291 --> 41:20.325
or another little statue
of a..."

41:20.327 --> 41:21.825
That's alive.

41:21.827 --> 41:25.162
Yes, that is a Madagascan
blue panther chameleon.

41:25.164 --> 41:26.999
It's one of the last
of its kind.

41:27.001 --> 41:29.233
Is it?

41:29.235 --> 41:30.434
Just like you.

41:30.436 --> 41:32.036
Well, you know what, Jo?

41:32.038 --> 41:34.171
I don't give a crap if you're
a legend in the game.

41:34.173 --> 41:36.575
If you're not gonna pay me for
work that I've actually done,

41:36.577 --> 41:37.675
then I'm out!

41:37.677 --> 41:39.311
Screw you, Medusa!

41:39.313 --> 41:41.079
I'm not Medusa.

41:44.851 --> 41:47.121
And she's gone.

42:17.284 --> 42:19.550
Are you...
Are you all right, miss?

42:19.552 --> 42:22.287
Oh, is there a doctor
in the house?

42:22.289 --> 42:24.354
Oh, somebody, please, help me!

42:24.356 --> 42:25.523
What are the signs
of a stroke?

42:25.525 --> 42:27.525
I can't feel my tits!

42:29.630 --> 42:31.662
Goodness me!

42:31.664 --> 42:33.164
Are you all right, miss?

42:33.166 --> 42:34.566
Are you okay?

42:34.568 --> 42:36.804
She's all right.
Aren't you, sis?

42:40.708 --> 42:43.874
Yeah, I'm feeling
so much better, actually.

42:43.876 --> 42:46.845
Good on you. That's my chook.
Come on.

42:46.847 --> 42:48.546
Come on.
Let's get you up.

42:48.548 --> 42:49.847
- Yeah.
- No worries.

42:49.849 --> 42:51.081
I think it was
just a big burp.

42:51.083 --> 42:52.752
- You enjoy the sun.
- My pleasure.

42:53.387 --> 42:54.586
What's up, Jo?

42:54.588 --> 42:55.653
I thought
you were leaving, Pen.

42:55.655 --> 42:57.990
I was, and then...

42:57.992 --> 43:01.927
I just realized
this place is great.

43:01.929 --> 43:04.996
There just isn't room
for both of us

43:04.998 --> 43:06.697
in Beaumont-Sur-Mer.

43:06.699 --> 43:08.865
Mmm. Agree to unagree.

43:08.867 --> 43:12.070
This is my home

43:12.072 --> 43:14.373
and my place of work

43:14.375 --> 43:16.708
and you are a bull
in my china shop.

43:16.710 --> 43:20.412
Well, you don't really
affect my life that much.

43:20.414 --> 43:22.546
Oh, piss off,
you moonfaced troll!

43:22.548 --> 43:23.682
Whoa!

43:23.684 --> 43:25.282
Careful there.

43:25.284 --> 43:27.851
People might think you're more
than just an animatronic cocktease.

43:27.853 --> 43:28.855
Okay, come on.

43:32.057 --> 43:34.092
Ow! Arm!

43:34.094 --> 43:35.659
Hands off the merchandise.

43:35.661 --> 43:37.162
I bruise like a peach.

43:37.164 --> 43:39.630
Shall we settle this
with a friendly wager?

43:39.632 --> 43:40.865
Like a turf war?

43:40.867 --> 43:42.766
Whoever wins gets dibs
on the town?

43:42.768 --> 43:45.735
Loser leaves for good.

43:45.737 --> 43:47.005
Well, what's the bet?

43:47.007 --> 43:48.206
We choose a man.

43:48.208 --> 43:51.041
First to extract a set sum
from him wins.

43:51.043 --> 43:53.744
That sounds like a party.
Yeah, how much?

43:53.746 --> 43:56.481
How about your net worth?
500,000?

43:56.483 --> 43:57.648
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:57.650 --> 43:59.816
Is that too rich
for your blood?

43:59.818 --> 44:01.019
Are you kidding?

44:01.021 --> 44:05.088
My blood is, like,
98% white chocolate mousse.

44:05.090 --> 44:07.992
So, I can...
I can handle it, yeah.

44:07.994 --> 44:09.094
Who's the mark?

44:11.498 --> 44:13.430
<i>Monsieur!</i>

44:13.432 --> 44:15.735
How about that guy?

44:16.402 --> 44:17.735
He's 12.

44:17.737 --> 44:19.771
Ah, too young for your blood?

44:19.773 --> 44:21.305
Guillaume?

44:21.307 --> 44:24.409
Is that boy
a guest at the hotel?

44:24.411 --> 44:26.010
Yes, that is
Thomas Westerberg.

44:26.012 --> 44:28.746
He is the inventor of YaBurnt.

44:28.748 --> 44:30.514
- Shut my back door.
- What? Why?

44:30.516 --> 44:32.985
What is YaBurnt?

44:32.987 --> 44:34.351
Honestly?

44:34.353 --> 44:36.054
Jo, are you, like,
100 years old?

44:36.056 --> 44:38.990
It's, like, this really cool app
where it sends all your friends

44:38.992 --> 44:40.124
these disgusting insults

44:40.126 --> 44:41.592
and then they disappear
after 10 seconds.

44:41.594 --> 44:42.860
Why would anyone want that?

44:42.862 --> 44:45.097
Why would anyone
want Christmas, either?

44:45.099 --> 44:48.266
So, he's a tech millionaire?

44:48.268 --> 44:50.133
Billionaire, I bet.

44:50.135 --> 44:51.204
So, do we have a deal?

44:51.804 --> 44:52.936
One week.

44:52.938 --> 44:54.674
May the best con win.

45:17.864 --> 45:21.168
Hey, uh, do you mind if I
spin the thingy next round?

45:23.369 --> 45:26.470
Okay. That's your job.

45:26.472 --> 45:27.675
Shut up, Thomas.

45:34.380 --> 45:36.213
- <i>Monsieur.</i>
- Yes?

45:36.215 --> 45:37.550
Please place your bets.

45:51.664 --> 45:52.900
No more bets.

45:56.936 --> 45:59.039
Eighteen red.

46:03.376 --> 46:04.608
Sorry, comin' through.

46:04.610 --> 46:06.077
Sorry, excuse me.

46:06.079 --> 46:07.845
- My goodness!
- Sorry, miss, please.

46:07.847 --> 46:11.516
Oi, blind person here.
Move! Move!

46:11.518 --> 46:13.150
Yeah.

46:13.152 --> 46:14.187
Yeah.

46:15.088 --> 46:16.854
Oh. Pardon the intrusion,

46:16.856 --> 46:18.255
but could somebody tell me

46:18.257 --> 46:19.891
if there's an empty chair
at this table?

46:19.893 --> 46:21.925
No, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
The table is full.

46:21.927 --> 46:23.595
Oh. Okey-dokey.

46:23.597 --> 46:26.597
No, miss. Miss? Excuse me.
You can have my chair.

46:26.599 --> 46:27.965
Oh, a hero.

46:27.967 --> 46:29.700
Oh, but it's not necessary.

46:29.702 --> 46:31.970
Perhaps if, um,
this person scoots over,

46:31.972 --> 46:33.938
we could just squeeze in
another chair.

46:33.940 --> 46:36.206
- Yeah, sure.
- Do you mind, sir?

46:36.208 --> 46:38.275
Would you mind just, um...

46:38.277 --> 46:39.776
Right behind you.

46:39.778 --> 46:41.878
- Oh.
- There you go.

46:41.880 --> 46:43.414
- Thank you.
- All right?

46:43.416 --> 46:45.583
Wow. What wonderful
blind person etiquette.

46:45.585 --> 46:47.052
My nana was blind.

46:47.054 --> 46:48.619
Was she?

46:48.621 --> 46:49.922
I had no idea.

46:50.889 --> 46:51.988
Research.

46:51.990 --> 46:53.657
Please place your bets.

46:53.659 --> 46:56.228
Oh. Do you want me
to place a bet for you?

46:56.230 --> 46:57.295
Yeah, could you?

46:57.297 --> 46:59.664
- Yeah, of course.
- But can you choose?

46:59.666 --> 47:01.798
I feel like I need somebody
else's luck right now.

47:01.800 --> 47:03.467
- Sure.
- Okay.

47:03.469 --> 47:05.271
All right,
keep your fingers crossed.

47:07.806 --> 47:08.808
No more bets.

47:10.643 --> 47:11.809
Twenty-one red.

47:11.811 --> 47:12.909
How did we do?

47:12.911 --> 47:14.979
We lost. I'm so sorry.

47:14.981 --> 47:17.148
- What?
- Yeah, it happens.

47:17.150 --> 47:18.652
That was my last chance.

47:19.351 --> 47:21.318
Last chance? For...

47:21.320 --> 47:22.822
Wait! Miss!

47:23.422 --> 47:24.856
Miss, wait. Miss?

47:24.858 --> 47:26.291
<i>Monsieur,</i> your chips.

47:26.293 --> 47:28.092
Oh, yeah, thank you.

47:31.965 --> 47:33.667
Thank you, thank you. Sorry.

47:35.168 --> 47:36.766
Thank you. Miss!

47:39.505 --> 47:41.141
Miss! Miss?

47:41.974 --> 47:43.043
Your winnings.

47:47.514 --> 47:50.447
Miss! Miss? Miss?
Excuse me? Hi.

47:50.449 --> 47:51.782
You left your cane.

47:51.784 --> 47:53.717
Oh, thanks
for bringing it back.

47:53.719 --> 47:56.019
I'm so embarrassed. Did I,
like, cause a big scene?

47:56.021 --> 47:58.690
No, no. It's okay. But you
said something in there.

47:58.692 --> 48:01.059
You said that that was
your last chance.

48:01.061 --> 48:03.628
- What for?
- To help my sister.

48:03.630 --> 48:05.898
- Oh.
- She's my baby sister.

48:07.333 --> 48:08.934
- Oh.
- You're looking at a picture

48:08.936 --> 48:10.367
of a really hot girl, right?

48:10.369 --> 48:13.670
Uh... Yes. Yeah, I am.

48:13.672 --> 48:15.508
Are my eyes tearing up?

48:16.876 --> 48:18.644
'Cause sometimes I can't tell.

48:24.684 --> 48:26.650
At least you won big, huh?

48:26.652 --> 48:28.151
Not yet.

48:28.153 --> 48:31.755
Go and see what big-titted
Russell Crowe is up to.

48:31.757 --> 48:33.023
<i>Here.
Here you go, Penny.</i>

48:33.025 --> 48:34.860
No, no, no, Thomas.
I cannot take that.

48:34.862 --> 48:37.427
- Yes, you can, Penny.
- No, I can't.

48:37.429 --> 48:38.762
Penny, you have to.

48:38.764 --> 48:41.898
Your sister needs that
final cleft palate surgery.

48:41.900 --> 48:44.202
Yeah, she does.

48:44.204 --> 48:46.037
- Penny...
- Hmm?

48:46.039 --> 48:47.070
What about you?

48:47.072 --> 48:48.773
What do you mean,
what about me?

48:48.775 --> 48:51.775
Well, do you mind
if I ask you how you...

48:51.777 --> 48:53.177
got blind?

48:53.179 --> 48:54.181
Yeah.

48:56.083 --> 48:58.916
My condition is 100% mental.

48:58.918 --> 49:00.717
Hysterical blindness?

49:00.719 --> 49:02.253
It's not that funny to me,
Thomas.

49:02.255 --> 49:04.289
No, I know. What I mean is,

49:04.291 --> 49:06.858
it means there's hope for you
to see again.

49:06.860 --> 49:07.992
Right?

49:07.994 --> 49:10.628
People say that,
but I've tried everything.

49:10.630 --> 49:12.896
Hypnosis, drugs...

49:12.898 --> 49:15.099
I even hired this guy Barry
to follow me around

49:15.101 --> 49:17.635
and scare me
in parking structures.

49:17.637 --> 49:19.302
He'd just be like, "Hey!"

49:20.572 --> 49:23.575
Turns out this is not like
having the hiccups.

49:23.577 --> 49:25.275
Well, there must be something.

49:25.277 --> 49:29.213
Well, there is, like,
this one psychologist,

49:29.215 --> 49:30.782
up in this clinic in Germany,

49:30.784 --> 49:33.650
that does, like,
really cutting-edge stuff.

49:33.652 --> 49:35.753
But it's so expensive.

49:35.755 --> 49:37.590
Well, how much
does this doctor charge?

49:38.458 --> 49:39.958
$500,000.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.958
- Damn!
- I know!

49:41.960 --> 49:44.664
But Dr. Schauffhaussen
is that gifted.

49:45.965 --> 49:47.932
Forget about it.

49:47.934 --> 49:49.633
What is sight worth, anyways?

49:49.635 --> 49:51.771
$500,000?

49:52.206 --> 49:53.440
Seems so.

49:59.512 --> 50:01.515
She's using all your tricks!

50:02.682 --> 50:04.182
Fine.

50:04.184 --> 50:05.652
Let's use some of hers.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.789
But enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

50:10.791 --> 50:12.090
What's your story?

50:12.092 --> 50:14.124
No, well, no story, really.

50:14.126 --> 50:17.595
These French investor guys,
uh, flew me out here,

50:17.597 --> 50:19.496
I guess to hear
about my new venture.

50:19.498 --> 50:21.298
- Oh.
- But I'm starting to feel like

50:21.300 --> 50:23.099
they just want
another YaBurnt.

50:23.101 --> 50:24.769
- Ya-what?
- YaBurnt.

50:24.771 --> 50:26.871
It's an app that I designed.

50:26.873 --> 50:29.706
Oh.
Like an appetizer?

50:29.708 --> 50:31.476
I love 'em
when they're bottomless.

50:33.179 --> 50:34.181
That's good!

50:36.416 --> 50:38.849
- No, not an appetizer.
- Oh.

50:38.851 --> 50:41.820
An app like an application
for a smartphone.

50:41.822 --> 50:43.019
Oh, okay.

50:43.021 --> 50:44.889
But my new concept,

50:44.891 --> 50:49.994
it's something that I think
could really help people...

50:49.996 --> 50:54.735
if anyone would actually
listen to what I have in mind.

50:56.036 --> 50:57.367
I get it.

50:57.369 --> 50:58.804
You're a really kind guy.

50:59.505 --> 51:00.740
I could see that...

51:02.141 --> 51:03.644
If only I could see.

51:04.476 --> 51:05.545
Penny...

51:07.313 --> 51:10.414
Penny, what is the name of
that doctor you told me about?

51:10.416 --> 51:11.516
Oh, um...

51:11.518 --> 51:12.719
Doctor...

51:14.987 --> 51:16.153
Schauffhaussen.

51:16.155 --> 51:17.554
- Schauffhaussen.
- Schauffhaussen.

51:17.556 --> 51:19.724
How do you spell that?
Is that S-C-H?

51:19.726 --> 51:22.392
- Sure.
- Okay.

51:22.394 --> 51:23.494
Wait, what are you doing?

51:23.496 --> 51:24.865
I'm looking him up online.

51:27.166 --> 51:28.599
Not much is known
about the good doctor.

51:28.601 --> 51:30.568
I hear he's a recluse.

51:30.570 --> 51:31.936
No, I found his website.

51:31.938 --> 51:33.704
- Really?
- Awesome.

51:33.706 --> 51:35.273
Whoa.

51:35.275 --> 51:36.677
No, here's an e-mail address.

51:37.677 --> 51:39.443
Okay, you're kidding me.

51:39.445 --> 51:40.610
Whoa. No way.

51:40.612 --> 51:42.380
- Yeah.
- No way.

51:42.382 --> 51:44.715
I've sent something.
There we go.

51:44.717 --> 51:46.851
- See what happens.
- Thomas, no, you...

51:46.853 --> 51:48.219
- Oh...
- No.

51:48.221 --> 51:50.220
You really shouldn't have.

51:50.222 --> 51:51.956
Let's not get our hopes up.

51:51.958 --> 51:53.090
Okay.

51:53.092 --> 51:54.525
He responded!

51:54.527 --> 51:56.126
Of course he did.

51:56.128 --> 51:57.596
Oh,
it's an out-of-office reply.

51:58.565 --> 51:59.697
Oh.

51:59.699 --> 52:01.268
Let's see
if he's on social media.

52:02.635 --> 52:03.735
Oh, my God.

52:03.737 --> 52:05.739
- No way! Oh, my God.
- What?

52:16.882 --> 52:18.749
Uh, excuse me, sir?

52:18.751 --> 52:21.552
Hi. Uh, hi. My name's Thomas

52:21.554 --> 52:25.490
and my friend Penny really,
really needs your help.

52:25.492 --> 52:28.392
I just saw your photo
on Instagram,

52:28.394 --> 52:29.626
and I had to come find you.

52:29.628 --> 52:31.595
This is beyond coincidence.

52:31.597 --> 52:35.231
It means something
that you're here. Um...

52:35.233 --> 52:37.269
So, what do you say,
Dr. Schauffhaussen?

52:38.503 --> 52:39.772
Will you help my friend?

52:50.983 --> 52:52.849
Siri, I need to learn German.

52:52.851 --> 52:55.087
That is not German.

52:57.322 --> 52:58.623
That is Dutch.

52:58.625 --> 53:00.958
Oh, um...

53:00.960 --> 53:02.892
Hi, we met
at the roulette table.

53:02.894 --> 53:04.862
That is incorrect.
We did not meet.

53:04.864 --> 53:06.530
Otherwise,
you would know that I...

53:06.532 --> 53:07.867
You're Dr. Schauffhaussen?

53:09.668 --> 53:11.538
Precisely.

53:22.215 --> 53:23.680
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

53:23.682 --> 53:26.416
No, wait, Dr. Schauffhaussen.
I'm sorry if I offended you.

53:26.418 --> 53:27.784
I am not offended.

53:27.786 --> 53:29.186
It's just that
I looked you up online,

53:29.188 --> 53:30.688
I couldn't find a photo

53:30.690 --> 53:31.889
and, I don't know,

53:31.891 --> 53:33.893
I just didn't think
you would be a woman.

53:35.362 --> 53:36.661
I am offended now.

53:36.663 --> 53:38.563
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

53:38.565 --> 53:41.568
Please don't punish Penny
for my sexism.

53:42.034 --> 53:44.135
Penny?

53:44.137 --> 53:46.470
Is this Penny from
Cootamundra, Australia?

53:46.472 --> 53:47.905
Yes! Yeah, that's her.

53:47.907 --> 53:51.577
I remember her letters.
Such a tragic case.

53:52.777 --> 53:55.012
- Good luck to you both.
- Wait.

53:55.014 --> 53:56.713
Dr. Schauffhaussen,
what do I have to do

53:56.715 --> 53:58.715
to get you to
see her here, tonight?

53:58.717 --> 54:00.818
- Young man...
- Thomas.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.186
Thomas,
it would be inappropriate

54:03.188 --> 54:04.521
and unprofessional of me

54:04.523 --> 54:06.055
to see patients
while on my holiday.

54:06.057 --> 54:08.025
Well, if it's a matter
of money, I can...

54:08.027 --> 54:09.894
You haven't given her
any money, have you?

54:09.896 --> 54:12.028
Well, some.
But just for her sister.

54:12.030 --> 54:15.900
You must not,
under any circumstances,

54:15.902 --> 54:17.901
give the patient money.

54:17.903 --> 54:19.704
Otherwise,
this reinforces the notion

54:19.706 --> 54:20.771
that she's totally disabled

54:20.773 --> 54:22.675
rendering the treatment kaput!

54:23.543 --> 54:26.276
Wait, so you will treat her?

54:26.278 --> 54:29.213
I agree
to an initial examination.

54:29.215 --> 54:31.852
- Yes!
- I am too much the softie.

54:32.452 --> 54:33.854
Where is she now?

54:40.025 --> 54:41.027
Penny?

54:44.429 --> 54:47.632
Coming.
Just one second! One sec.

54:47.634 --> 54:49.802
I've got
a surprise for ya.

54:51.371 --> 54:53.704
- Thomas, where did you go?
- Yeah?

54:53.706 --> 54:55.807
You'll never guess
who I found.

54:55.809 --> 54:58.077
- Who?
- Who do you think?

54:59.612 --> 55:02.983
It's Dr. Frederika
Schauffhaussen.

55:04.449 --> 55:06.483
Oh, she can't believe it!

55:06.485 --> 55:08.586
Believe it, <i>Fraulein.</i>

55:08.588 --> 55:12.724
I am here to help you,
dear girl.

55:12.726 --> 55:15.592
Dr. Schauffhaussen was having
dinner at the hotel tonight.

55:15.594 --> 55:18.929
I saw her Insta post.
Isn't it incredible?

55:18.931 --> 55:20.130
Incredible.

55:20.132 --> 55:21.632
I must make
my assessment of the patient.

55:21.634 --> 55:22.733
- Thomas?
- Yes?

55:22.735 --> 55:24.237
I require a chair.

55:26.806 --> 55:28.137
A warning.

55:28.139 --> 55:31.243
My methods are unorthodox.

55:32.577 --> 55:33.579
You understand?

55:34.347 --> 55:35.612
- Yes.
- Thank you.

55:35.614 --> 55:37.148
Remove your person
from the treatment space.

55:37.150 --> 55:39.249
Oh. Okay, uh, here?

55:44.757 --> 55:45.759
Sit.

55:46.860 --> 55:50.795
So, you can see
absolutely nothing?

55:50.797 --> 55:53.530
No shapes, no light, no color?

55:53.532 --> 55:55.599
No, nothing at all.
That's what I said...

55:55.601 --> 55:56.670
Silence!

55:58.103 --> 55:59.304
Hey, I need that.

55:59.306 --> 56:02.206
You will no longer use
this crutch of the mind.

56:04.543 --> 56:07.280
Stubborn like the patient.

56:09.648 --> 56:11.347
I see.

56:11.349 --> 56:14.320
You do not, but I see.

56:18.891 --> 56:20.360
Has the test started yet?

56:20.960 --> 56:21.961
Impressive.

56:22.829 --> 56:24.494
Okay, Penny.

56:24.496 --> 56:26.031
How about this?

56:35.940 --> 56:39.245
I am funneling the air
directly into your eye cavity.

56:41.813 --> 56:43.646
My mouth hole is very narrow.

56:43.648 --> 56:45.417
You should
not be feeling this.

56:55.327 --> 56:57.096
I just smell salmon.

56:59.797 --> 57:01.498
It's very interesting.

57:01.500 --> 57:05.572
The body reacts,
but the mind does not.

57:07.873 --> 57:10.740
Penny, I would like you
to have a little snack.

57:10.742 --> 57:13.276
But you must guess the food
that you're eating, <i>ja?</i>

57:13.278 --> 57:15.114
Yeah,
that sounds easy enough.

57:20.920 --> 57:22.422
I will ready the snack.

57:50.115 --> 57:51.248
Okay, Penny.

57:51.250 --> 57:53.050
Here comes
the choo-choo train.

57:53.052 --> 57:56.155
Open wide.

57:56.755 --> 57:58.391
Aah...

58:03.929 --> 58:05.829
What is that?

58:05.831 --> 58:07.865
A french fry.

58:07.867 --> 58:10.003
Mmm. Can I have another one?

58:12.405 --> 58:14.671
You are
a very good blind person.

58:14.673 --> 58:16.441
As such, you must surely know

58:16.443 --> 58:19.008
the number of steps
between you and the door.

58:19.010 --> 58:20.309
Uh-huh.

58:20.311 --> 58:24.113
And the number from the door
to the elevator.

58:24.115 --> 58:26.583
Because this is how the visually
impaired function in the world.

58:26.585 --> 58:29.854
Otherwise you would be running
into things all the time, <i>ja?</i>

58:29.856 --> 58:32.423
Yeah, I know all the steps.

58:32.425 --> 58:33.426
<i>Ja.</i>

58:34.159 --> 58:36.427
Okay, Penny.

58:36.429 --> 58:37.595
I have opened the door.

58:37.597 --> 58:39.929
An unobstructed path exists.

58:39.931 --> 58:43.867
I want you to run
full-speed down hallway

58:43.869 --> 58:46.137
and stop in front
of the elevator.

58:46.139 --> 58:47.505
You can do this, then, <i>ja?</i>

58:47.507 --> 58:49.706
Yeah, well, of course, then.

58:49.708 --> 58:51.874
Yeah, it's pretty simple
for a blind person

58:51.876 --> 58:54.510
to just run
in a straight line, so...

58:55.614 --> 58:58.350
As fast as you can. Go!

58:59.485 --> 59:01.653
- Um, now?
- <i>Ja!</i>

59:08.460 --> 59:09.461
Penny!

59:10.896 --> 59:12.465
I will take the case.

59:26.179 --> 59:28.211
Come, Thomas,
I give you a tour.

59:28.213 --> 59:29.215
Okay.

59:30.550 --> 59:32.152
- Should we... Oh.
- Come.

59:32.719 --> 59:34.150
Quickly now.

59:34.152 --> 59:35.686
- But what about...
- Thank you.

59:35.688 --> 59:37.021
Is this it?

59:37.023 --> 59:39.155
Hello?

59:39.157 --> 59:40.259
We're here?

59:42.628 --> 59:44.163
Hello? Uh...

59:47.065 --> 59:48.231
Oh, it's on.

59:48.233 --> 59:50.666
Dr. Schauffhaussen,
about your fee.

59:50.668 --> 59:52.403
I have to move
a few things around,

59:52.405 --> 59:54.271
but I'll have it for you
really soon.

59:54.273 --> 59:55.706
- Oh.
- Hey, guys?

59:55.708 --> 59:58.778
I think somebody accidentally
locked the front door.

01:00:00.045 --> 01:00:03.112
Guys? Guys, are you there?

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:06.583
Whoa! Uh, sorry!

01:00:06.585 --> 01:00:09.519
I hope that wasn't a priceless
work of art or anything!

01:00:09.521 --> 01:00:10.887
What if she gets hurt
out there?

01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:13.691
This is precisely why
we do not intervene, Thomas.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:16.459
Negative reinforcement
is the prescription.

01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:19.563
It is our job, yours <i>und</i> mine,

01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:20.798
- to have fun.
- Fun?

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.932
- Fun.
- Okay.

01:00:22.934 --> 01:00:25.270
You're thinking
I am loony tune, <i>ja?</i>

01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:29.039
- I am not.
- No?

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:32.075
If we do this in front
of Penny, have the fun,

01:00:32.077 --> 01:00:34.610
she will want nothing
more than to join us

01:00:34.612 --> 01:00:36.949
in our seeing fun.

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:38.782
Yeah.

01:00:38.784 --> 01:00:41.621
Why do I smell clinical
strength lady douche wipes?

01:00:42.788 --> 01:00:43.954
Oh.

01:00:43.956 --> 01:00:45.592
Very strong.

01:00:46.824 --> 01:00:50.094
No pity, Thomas. Only fun.

01:00:50.096 --> 01:00:52.329
I also smell early menopause.

01:00:52.331 --> 01:00:53.500
Now, the house.

01:01:04.277 --> 01:01:06.309
Why are we doing this again?

01:01:06.311 --> 01:01:09.146
Just as you take
Thomas's arm when we walk,

01:01:09.148 --> 01:01:11.615
so you take my leash
when we ride.

01:01:11.617 --> 01:01:13.617
That makes zero sense.

01:01:13.619 --> 01:01:15.321
A hill approaches.

01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:21.458
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.427
<i>- Merci.
- Merci, merci.</i>

01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:25.262
This Cabernet.
Oh, I love this one.

01:01:25.264 --> 01:01:27.498
It turns quite chewy,

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.434
- <i>und</i> you can really taste oak.
- Can I have some?

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:33.172
Oh. Of course, Penny.
You may have some of mine.

01:01:34.172 --> 01:01:35.274
Oh.

01:01:37.175 --> 01:01:39.342
Is there a glass here?

01:01:39.344 --> 01:01:40.543
You may drink the wine

01:01:40.545 --> 01:01:43.048
when you see the glass
well enough to seize it.

01:01:47.452 --> 01:01:50.653
Oh. Oh, God. Did I spill
something just now?

01:01:52.557 --> 01:01:54.224
Oh, I'm so clumsy.

01:01:54.226 --> 01:01:57.293
Dr. Schauffhaussen,
um, let me help you.

01:01:57.295 --> 01:01:59.061
Oh, no. I feel terrible.

01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:00.799
Did I spill wine on your...

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:15.679
Waiter!

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.528
Uh, are you sure that
this is helping Penny?

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:33.530
Oh, trust me,
this is for Penny's sake.

01:02:33.532 --> 01:02:34.597
Okay.

01:02:34.599 --> 01:02:36.432
You should see us, Penny.

01:02:36.434 --> 01:02:38.601
Thomas and I are dancing.

01:02:38.603 --> 01:02:40.371
Oh, I wish I could.

01:02:40.373 --> 01:02:43.740
But you can, Penny. You can.

01:02:43.742 --> 01:02:45.508
Yeah, I could also
eat my own shit,

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:46.911
but I'm not doing that either.

01:02:46.913 --> 01:02:49.949
It's okay, I'll just stand
here minding your bag.

01:02:52.451 --> 01:02:55.351
She's got a fuzzbox
and knows how to use it.

01:02:55.353 --> 01:02:56.519
Pardon?

01:02:56.521 --> 01:02:58.121
Your friend with the bony ass

01:02:58.123 --> 01:03:00.525
grinding away
on that poor boy.

01:03:01.726 --> 01:03:02.892
Oh.

01:03:02.894 --> 01:03:04.095
Yeah, I wouldn't mind so much.

01:03:04.097 --> 01:03:06.162
It's just that he used to be
my boyfriend.

01:03:06.164 --> 01:03:08.398
He was not!

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.932
And she's my best friend.

01:03:09.934 --> 01:03:11.938
She is not!

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:14.438
Oh, my God.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.141
Babe, you are, like,
actually blind.

01:03:18.143 --> 01:03:19.642
Oh, babe.

01:03:19.644 --> 01:03:21.545
Blind as in "can't see" blind?

01:03:21.547 --> 01:03:24.280
It was when I lost my sight
that she moved in on him.

01:03:24.282 --> 01:03:26.450
Shut up.

01:03:26.452 --> 01:03:27.818
Watch us, Penny.

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.090
The way our bodies
move in unison.

01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:34.925
So sensual.

01:03:34.927 --> 01:03:37.594
Right. I'm hitting her
really hard in her vagina.

01:03:37.596 --> 01:03:41.298
It's just if I could work out
some way to get him alone,

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.534
then maybe he wouldn't
call off the wedding.

01:03:43.536 --> 01:03:45.936
You leave it with us,
all right? I mean,

01:03:45.938 --> 01:03:47.503
we are practically
professionals,

01:03:47.505 --> 01:03:49.005
my little blind poppet.

01:03:49.007 --> 01:03:50.942
Girls, toilet.

01:04:03.088 --> 01:04:05.523
That color looks boss on you.

01:04:05.525 --> 01:04:06.759
<i>Danke.</i>

01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:12.796
What is this?

01:04:12.798 --> 01:04:15.199
It's a little thing
we invented called Varma.

01:04:15.201 --> 01:04:16.467
Karma.

01:04:16.469 --> 01:04:17.537
Karma.

01:04:19.271 --> 01:04:20.436
Oh, it is on.

01:04:20.438 --> 01:04:22.841
It is on like Kim Kardashian.

01:04:25.043 --> 01:04:26.709
- Is that nice?
- Yeah, you want some?

01:04:26.711 --> 01:04:28.612
- Oh, uh, yeah, sure.
- Oh, sorry.

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:29.813
Uh...

01:04:29.815 --> 01:04:31.882
Yeah. Thank you.

01:04:31.884 --> 01:04:34.450
Uh, it's kinda weird
that Dr. Schauffhaussen

01:04:34.452 --> 01:04:36.519
just disappeared
like that, right?

01:04:36.521 --> 01:04:38.854
Germans are so spontaneous.

01:04:38.856 --> 01:04:42.358
It's probably just part of her
crazy treatment plan.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.862
Yeah, don't give up
on that, Penny, okay?

01:04:44.864 --> 01:04:46.195
I mean, I know that it's hard,

01:04:46.197 --> 01:04:48.831
but there's so much that
you deserve to see.

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:50.233
Like this view,

01:04:50.235 --> 01:04:52.034
and these lights,

01:04:52.036 --> 01:04:53.470
and the face you make

01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:54.871
when you think
I'm being a dork.

01:04:54.873 --> 01:04:56.572
What, this one?

01:04:56.574 --> 01:04:58.977
Yeah, that one.

01:04:59.577 --> 01:05:00.744
But that one...

01:05:00.746 --> 01:05:02.646
- That one's my favorite.
- What?

01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:04.851
- That one.
- No, what?

01:05:05.416 --> 01:05:07.117
Shut up.

01:05:07.119 --> 01:05:08.818
Well, you'll just
have to take my word for it.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.887
As the sole sighted person
between us,

01:05:11.889 --> 01:05:13.658
you're beautiful, Penny.

01:05:16.929 --> 01:05:19.530
Anyway, I'm sure
Dr. Schauffhaussen's gonna

01:05:19.532 --> 01:05:21.398
break out
the big psychological guns

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.333
once I actually
give her the fee.

01:05:24.335 --> 01:05:28.070
Oh, um, yeah, about that.
I was gonna say to you,

01:05:28.072 --> 01:05:29.840
is it possible
to give me the money

01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:32.675
and then I'll just give it
to Dr. Schauffhaussen?

01:05:32.677 --> 01:05:35.845
- Oh.
- I know this will sound silly,

01:05:35.847 --> 01:05:38.749
but it would just make me feel
like I'm less of a charity case.

01:05:38.751 --> 01:05:41.418
Totally. I completely
understand. I, um...

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.755
I just have to, uh,
sell the last of my stock.

01:05:45.757 --> 01:05:48.224
Wait, don't you own, like,
the whole company?

01:05:48.226 --> 01:05:51.126
You're, like, so rich.

01:05:51.128 --> 01:05:52.762
- No.
- No?

01:05:52.764 --> 01:05:54.063
No. Um...

01:05:54.065 --> 01:05:56.700
The algorithm
for YaBurnt was mine,

01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:59.436
but the seed investors
actually bought me out.

01:05:59.438 --> 01:06:00.704
Yeah, for how much?

01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:02.606
A cool million.

01:06:02.608 --> 01:06:06.642
Um, but I only have
400,000 left.

01:06:06.644 --> 01:06:10.414
Uh, but it's okay. My nana's gonna...
She's gonna loan me the rest.

01:06:10.416 --> 01:06:13.717
So, after you pay the
Dr. Schauffhaussen fee, you'd be broke?

01:06:13.719 --> 01:06:15.284
Yeah, but it's fine.

01:06:15.286 --> 01:06:17.220
Because I have
a lot of good ideas,

01:06:17.222 --> 01:06:18.424
and hoodies are cheap.

01:06:19.157 --> 01:06:20.257
I don't get it though.

01:06:20.259 --> 01:06:21.825
Why would you
bankrupt yourself

01:06:21.827 --> 01:06:23.959
for someone
you don't even know?

01:06:23.961 --> 01:06:25.595
Like, I'm a stranger.

01:06:25.597 --> 01:06:28.798
Well, my nana...

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.400
My nana always said
that the best thing

01:06:30.402 --> 01:06:31.934
money can do is good.

01:06:31.936 --> 01:06:34.005
And you getting
to see again is good.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.344
Plus, you're not a stranger.

01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:40.579
You're Penny.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.982
Yes, I am.

01:06:54.827 --> 01:06:56.162
Honey, I'm home.

01:06:58.030 --> 01:06:59.429
Oh, please.

01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:04.034
You think I can't handle
the Real Housewives of Essex?

01:07:04.036 --> 01:07:06.537
It took a considerable
amount of limoncello

01:07:06.539 --> 01:07:08.137
and several rounds
of arm wrestling,

01:07:08.139 --> 01:07:09.775
but <i>c'est la vie.</i>

01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:12.141
The bet's off, Jo.

01:07:12.143 --> 01:07:13.644
Oh, don't go, Penny.

01:07:13.646 --> 01:07:15.479
You've taught me
so much about love.

01:07:15.481 --> 01:07:16.880
We need to find another mark.

01:07:16.882 --> 01:07:18.615
No, absolutely not.

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:19.849
I have had about
as much of this

01:07:19.851 --> 01:07:21.820
absurd interlude with you
as I can bear.

01:07:24.655 --> 01:07:26.491
Those are decorative.

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.025
He's a good guy, Jo.

01:07:29.027 --> 01:07:31.061
That's a moxy-noron, Pen.

01:07:31.063 --> 01:07:33.162
Okay, you know,
back in the day

01:07:33.164 --> 01:07:35.065
when I was just catfishing,

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:38.534
there was always this one
moment where I would decide,

01:07:38.536 --> 01:07:40.172
"I'm gonna take your money."

01:07:41.072 --> 01:07:42.572
And it wasn't when they fell

01:07:42.574 --> 01:07:45.641
for the superficial
hot girl bait

01:07:45.643 --> 01:07:48.545
or when they texted dick pics
like complete animals.

01:07:48.547 --> 01:07:51.414
It was when
we'd meet up in person

01:07:51.416 --> 01:07:53.152
and I'd come in

01:07:53.818 --> 01:07:55.054
and he'd just

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.889
look at me like that.

01:08:02.226 --> 01:08:04.730
And that's when I'd decide
to rob him blind.

01:08:06.699 --> 01:08:09.766
But when Thomas looks at me,
he doesn't do that.

01:08:09.768 --> 01:08:12.101
He's just different.

01:08:12.103 --> 01:08:13.802
He's a genuinely nice person.

01:08:13.804 --> 01:08:15.673
Yeah, but we're not
nice women, Penny, are we?

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:17.541
And this isn't
a likability contest.

01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:19.108
Lucky for you, 'cause I'd win.

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:20.209
Would you?

01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:22.346
Please.
Thomas loves me.

01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:26.615
He loves you?

01:08:26.617 --> 01:08:28.850
Like, I mean he'll do
whatever I want.

01:08:28.853 --> 01:08:31.288
Well, then it appears
we have our solution.

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:38.260
If you don't have
the stomach to take money

01:08:38.261 --> 01:08:40.098
from your darling Thomas,

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.067
darling Thomas
becomes the bet.

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:45.035
But I thought
you didn't nail your marks.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.537
Evidently, we must up the ante
in this little game of ours.

01:08:47.538 --> 01:08:49.738
Unless, of course,
you feel you're outmatched.

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.442
Please.
Guys love asses,

01:08:52.444 --> 01:08:54.981
but not when there's something
already stuck up there.

01:08:56.148 --> 01:08:57.915
Then we're agreed.

01:08:57.917 --> 01:08:59.919
Thomas is the bet.

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:01.420
Yeah.

01:09:04.288 --> 01:09:05.323
Yeah.

01:09:08.158 --> 01:09:09.926
Well, okay.

01:09:09.929 --> 01:09:11.294
I should really get to bed,

01:09:11.296 --> 01:09:14.330
'cause I've got such a big day
of seduction tomorrow.

01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:16.299
Oh, absolutely.

01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:17.733
How about a bedtime story?

01:09:17.734 --> 01:09:20.072
- Oh, no, that's not necessary.
- Albert!

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.140
Oh. Hi.

01:09:25.143 --> 01:09:27.611
- Thank you.
- Oh, that's not good.

01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:29.478
I do so admire their spirit.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:31.013
Less so their spray tans.

01:09:31.015 --> 01:09:32.115
Ladies.

01:09:34.752 --> 01:09:36.419
All right, my babe.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:37.423
Ah.

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:42.290
Oh, so you thought
you could play us, yeah?

01:09:42.292 --> 01:09:43.393
Ladies, I can explain.

01:09:43.395 --> 01:09:45.995
Babes, this is not
a good situation for you.

01:09:45.997 --> 01:09:47.531
My cousin's got the blinds

01:09:47.533 --> 01:09:48.697
- from the diabetes.
- Diabetes.

01:09:48.698 --> 01:09:50.867
Don't go to the hotel now, Jo.

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:53.669
Give it the night. He'll be
more energetic in the morning.

01:09:53.671 --> 01:09:55.104
Oh,
you're not going anywhere.

01:09:55.106 --> 01:09:57.173
Ladies, pass me the superglue.

01:10:06.384 --> 01:10:08.485
- Thomas.
- Dr. Schauffhaussen.

01:10:08.487 --> 01:10:10.353
Please...

01:10:10.355 --> 01:10:12.388
Call me Frederika.

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.889
Okay.

01:10:13.891 --> 01:10:16.394
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

01:10:17.395 --> 01:10:18.496
Come on in.

01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:20.131
Um...

01:10:28.206 --> 01:10:29.208
Thank you.

01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:33.210
A little treat for us.

01:10:33.212 --> 01:10:36.013
We've been working so hard
for sweet Penny.

01:10:36.015 --> 01:10:39.516
We deserve to be
a little selfish, <i>ja?</i>

01:10:39.518 --> 01:10:41.351
Some say these
are an aphrodisiac.

01:10:41.353 --> 01:10:42.686
- Oh, no, thank...
- Oh!

01:10:42.688 --> 01:10:44.720
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry, Doctor...

01:10:44.722 --> 01:10:46.557
No! I got it.
It's fine, it's fine.

01:10:46.559 --> 01:10:48.159
I got it, I got it. It's...

01:11:02.806 --> 01:11:03.809
Thank you.

01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:08.077
Thomas...

01:11:08.079 --> 01:11:09.981
I must be candid.

01:11:11.015 --> 01:11:13.318
I'm here
under false pretenses.

01:11:15.386 --> 01:11:17.022
- You are?
- <i>Ja.</i>

01:11:20.024 --> 01:11:21.092
Okay.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:32.702
I hope
this isn't inappropriate,

01:11:32.704 --> 01:11:34.937
but would you help me
with <i>mein</i> coding?

01:11:34.939 --> 01:11:36.205
<i>"Mein</i> coding"?

01:11:36.207 --> 01:11:38.273
<i>Ja,</i> I'm having trouble
with my website.

01:11:38.275 --> 01:11:40.242
- Oh, coding!
- Hmm.

01:11:40.244 --> 01:11:42.879
Yeah, sure. What seems
to be the problem?

01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:43.916
Well...

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:48.384
When I use JavaScript,
the HTTP crawler

01:11:48.386 --> 01:11:50.454
is not scraping
the metadata correctly

01:11:50.456 --> 01:11:53.055
and I am losing
the CSS properties.

01:11:53.057 --> 01:11:57.128
Well, did you try parsing the
CSS separately using regex?

01:11:59.631 --> 01:12:01.296
I did not.

01:12:01.298 --> 01:12:02.301
Hmm.

01:12:07.939 --> 01:12:11.040
Fixed! Well, it's been
a really long day.

01:12:11.042 --> 01:12:13.942
I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna...

01:12:13.944 --> 01:12:17.780
Are you aware that
it is a full moon tonight?

01:12:17.782 --> 01:12:19.482
Ah.

01:12:19.484 --> 01:12:22.384
I love to feel the air
on my skin.

01:12:22.386 --> 01:12:24.489
Right. Aren't you
kinda cold though?

01:12:28.627 --> 01:12:30.293
What are you doin'?

01:12:30.295 --> 01:12:32.961
I feel reckless tonight,
Thomas.

01:12:32.963 --> 01:12:35.134
Okay, that's not funny.
Can you come inside now?

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.967
If I fell, would you catch me?

01:12:37.969 --> 01:12:39.135
Stop it.

01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:40.139
Don't.

01:12:40.706 --> 01:12:41.707
Don't!

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:45.543
Oh!

01:12:46.177 --> 01:12:47.242
Thomas.

01:12:47.244 --> 01:12:48.844
- Dr. Schauffhaussen...
- Frederika.

01:12:48.846 --> 01:12:50.478
You've taught me so much
about discipline...

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.647
I can teach you more.

01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:53.316
- ...and integrity.
- <i>Ja,</i> sure.

01:12:53.318 --> 01:12:55.817
I think we should keep things
professional between us.

01:12:55.819 --> 01:12:58.189
- Aw...
- For Penny's sake.

01:13:01.326 --> 01:13:02.394
For Penny's sake?

01:13:05.329 --> 01:13:06.465
Of course.

01:13:08.065 --> 01:13:09.534
Well, I'll just...

01:13:11.836 --> 01:13:12.838
Go.

01:13:23.981 --> 01:13:25.050
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:28.653
Wait.

01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:41.532
Mmm. Thomas.

01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:48.437
Oh. Albert? Albert.
Hey, man.

01:13:48.439 --> 01:13:50.374
Um... Just a shot in the dark.

01:13:50.376 --> 01:13:53.412
Do you happen to have
superglue remover?

01:13:56.715 --> 01:13:58.417
Holy crap.
How did you have that?

01:13:59.182 --> 01:14:00.616
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:14:00.618 --> 01:14:02.121
Yes. Legend.

01:14:03.122 --> 01:14:04.123
Uh...

01:14:05.056 --> 01:14:06.157
Albert?

01:14:07.391 --> 01:14:09.094
Oh, come on,
that's just cruel!

01:14:26.145 --> 01:14:28.614
Ow!

01:14:37.454 --> 01:14:39.423
Hey, you. Hey.

01:14:39.425 --> 01:14:41.290
Do you know who
Josephine Chesterfield is?

01:14:41.292 --> 01:14:42.759
Or Dr. Schauffhaussen?

01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:44.494
<i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>
We know all her aliases.

01:14:44.496 --> 01:14:45.963
She's very generous.

01:14:46.597 --> 01:14:47.666
Uh...

01:14:49.434 --> 01:14:51.901
Hmm? All right,
so was she here last night?

01:14:51.903 --> 01:14:54.303
<i>Oui,</i> with the tech boy.

01:14:54.305 --> 01:14:56.942
Damn it. Okay, um...

01:14:57.908 --> 01:14:59.409
Well, wait. When she left,

01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:03.245
did she seem, like,
you know, satisfied?

01:15:03.247 --> 01:15:05.680
Like, you know, like,
she'd got some?

01:15:05.682 --> 01:15:07.583
- Oh, no.
- No?

01:15:07.585 --> 01:15:09.020
She hasn't left yet.

01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:36.847
Yeah, I know you won.
I'm getting outta here.

01:15:36.849 --> 01:15:39.214
Uh... What did I...
What did I win?

01:15:39.216 --> 01:15:41.817
Thomas,
what are you doing here?

01:15:41.819 --> 01:15:44.822
I'm here
to say goodbye.

01:15:46.123 --> 01:15:48.491
Where's Dr. Schauffhaussen,
then?

01:15:48.493 --> 01:15:50.861
Um... I don't know.

01:15:50.863 --> 01:15:53.629
This morning,
she kind of left in a hurry

01:15:53.631 --> 01:15:55.968
and now I have to go.

01:15:57.068 --> 01:15:58.835
The investors are, um,

01:15:58.837 --> 01:15:59.902
they're flying me home.

01:15:59.904 --> 01:16:01.437
I just needed to say,

01:16:01.439 --> 01:16:03.706
Penny, you're the one genuine,

01:16:03.708 --> 01:16:05.676
good thing that happened
to me here.

01:16:10.347 --> 01:16:12.016
Anyway, um...

01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:15.052
Bye, Penny.

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:23.562
Thomas, wait! Don't go!

01:16:35.038 --> 01:16:36.375
Penny!

01:16:37.609 --> 01:16:39.709
Oh, my God!
Penny, are you okay?

01:16:39.711 --> 01:16:41.843
This has been a brutal week.

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.018
Dick.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.724
Wait, Penny,
could you just see Albert?

01:16:53.725 --> 01:16:54.825
Uh...

01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:56.962
Did you just look at me?
Can you see me?

01:16:58.695 --> 01:17:00.263
Is your hair brownish?

01:17:00.265 --> 01:17:01.934
Yes! Yes, it is!

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.200
Wait, Penny.

01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:05.733
Can you read that?

01:17:05.735 --> 01:17:07.370
No, that's in French.

01:17:07.372 --> 01:17:09.138
Oh. Sorry.

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.572
What about this?

01:17:10.574 --> 01:17:13.409
"Social anxiety. You're not
the problem, the world is."

01:17:13.411 --> 01:17:15.579
Yes! Penny, you can see!

01:17:15.581 --> 01:17:17.312
I can finally see your face!

01:17:17.314 --> 01:17:20.449
- Oh, that's probably a bummer.
- No, come off it!

01:17:20.451 --> 01:17:23.251
- You got such a nice face.
- Oh.

01:17:23.253 --> 01:17:26.121
I guess
Dr. Schauffhaussen's money

01:17:26.123 --> 01:17:27.525
was put to good use, huh?

01:17:29.159 --> 01:17:31.393
What do you mean?

01:17:31.395 --> 01:17:33.562
You didn't give her
the 500,000, did you?

01:17:33.564 --> 01:17:34.830
Yeah, of course.

01:17:34.832 --> 01:17:36.799
I wanted to make sure that
your treatment continued.

01:17:36.801 --> 01:17:39.169
No, no. But that was
all that you had.

01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:42.571
It was worth
every penny, Penny.

01:17:45.844 --> 01:17:47.777
Wait a minute.
I don't understand.

01:17:47.779 --> 01:17:50.179
You're giving me $500,000?

01:17:50.181 --> 01:17:51.947
My sister just won
the lottery in Australia.

01:17:51.949 --> 01:17:53.982
And she used my birthday
and my bra size,

01:17:53.984 --> 01:17:55.184
so she owes me.

01:17:55.186 --> 01:17:57.419
I can't let you cover
my medical expenses.

01:17:57.421 --> 01:17:59.924
Well, regardless,
I cannot accept this.

01:18:01.826 --> 01:18:03.625
Thomas, no, I insist.

01:18:03.627 --> 01:18:04.862
Well, I resist.

01:18:07.532 --> 01:18:10.333
Stop. It's a $2 transaction
fee every time.

01:18:10.335 --> 01:18:12.835
Oh, shit. Well,
it's in your account now.

01:18:12.837 --> 01:18:14.273
No take-backs.

01:18:16.207 --> 01:18:17.305
Okay.

01:18:17.307 --> 01:18:18.342
Penny...

01:18:19.677 --> 01:18:21.878
Do you wanna come?

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.213
- Come with me.
- I'm not coming with you.

01:18:24.215 --> 01:18:25.317
Why not?

01:18:26.516 --> 01:18:28.220
'Cause you don't know me.

01:18:29.654 --> 01:18:31.056
Not the real me.

01:18:32.524 --> 01:18:34.824
Well, I'd like to,

01:18:34.826 --> 01:18:36.561
if you ever change your mind.

01:18:45.837 --> 01:18:46.838
All right.

01:18:56.247 --> 01:18:57.680
What have you done?

01:18:57.682 --> 01:18:59.348
How could you let him leave?

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:00.650
What are you
talking about?

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:01.951
You won the bet.

01:19:01.953 --> 01:19:04.019
Stop!

01:19:04.021 --> 01:19:07.690
Come back! Come back!
Come back! No! No!

01:19:10.561 --> 01:19:14.729
Aw, the plane didn't
stop for the crazy lady.

01:19:14.731 --> 01:19:15.964
Here she comes.

01:19:15.966 --> 01:19:20.805
Walk of shame. Walk of shame.
Walk of shame.

01:19:21.706 --> 01:19:23.238
Last night I went to his room

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.107
and, yes,
I tried to seduce him.

01:19:25.109 --> 01:19:26.442
And I thought I was
getting somewhere, too,

01:19:26.444 --> 01:19:27.744
because he turned out
the lights,

01:19:27.746 --> 01:19:29.911
but it was only to show me
a PowerPoint presentation

01:19:29.913 --> 01:19:31.246
all about his new app.

01:19:31.248 --> 01:19:32.714
Once he had
finished his pitch,

01:19:32.716 --> 01:19:34.215
I assumed we'd go to bed.

01:19:34.217 --> 01:19:36.085
Then he said
he's bit of a germophobe,

01:19:36.087 --> 01:19:38.454
so would I mind
taking a shower,

01:19:38.456 --> 01:19:40.055
and I was insulted,

01:19:40.057 --> 01:19:42.458
but I complied
for the sake of the bet.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.727
And when I emerged, he was
gone, my clothes were gone,

01:19:44.729 --> 01:19:46.129
my jewelry,
my phone, my laptop,

01:19:46.131 --> 01:19:48.500
even my limited edition
Jimmy Choos!

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:53.438
Come off it.

01:19:54.271 --> 01:19:55.604
You expect me to believe

01:19:55.606 --> 01:19:59.041
that that kind guy tried to
jack your Jimmy Choos

01:19:59.043 --> 01:20:01.477
when he just
returned to me $500,000

01:20:01.479 --> 01:20:02.481
that I tried to give him?

01:20:04.916 --> 01:20:07.250
Why did you give him $500,000?

01:20:07.252 --> 01:20:09.718
Because that's the amount
you stole from him.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.954
No!

01:20:10.956 --> 01:20:12.754
That is what I'm saying,
tits for brains!

01:20:12.756 --> 01:20:14.123
I didn't steal from him.

01:20:14.125 --> 01:20:16.728
I invested in his app!

01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:18.460
How much?

01:20:18.462 --> 01:20:21.664
$500,000.

01:20:22.934 --> 01:20:24.069
It's from Thomas.

01:20:24.636 --> 01:20:26.335
No!

01:20:26.337 --> 01:20:28.271
Let me see! Let me see!

01:20:28.273 --> 01:20:29.737
"Penny, I honestly meant
what I said just now,

01:20:29.739 --> 01:20:30.906
but here's the thing.

01:20:30.908 --> 01:20:33.409
Con artists make
the best marks of all.

01:20:33.411 --> 01:20:36.644
I was taught that by my nana.
Or as you may know her...

01:20:36.646 --> 01:20:38.013
Medusa."

01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:41.616
That means...

01:20:41.618 --> 01:20:43.652
You're Thomas's nana.

01:20:43.654 --> 01:20:46.554
- Oh, you sick perv!
- No! Christ, Penny!

01:20:46.556 --> 01:20:48.456
Clearly, Thomas's nana
was Medusa,

01:20:48.458 --> 01:20:50.927
and she passed the torch on to
him and now he's the new Medusa.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.528
What is wrong with you?

01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:54.899
He didn't transfer me
the Bitcoin back.

01:20:56.768 --> 01:20:58.534
He still has my 500,000.

01:20:58.536 --> 01:21:00.572
And my 500,000.

01:21:02.606 --> 01:21:05.711
Did we just give that boy
a million dollars?

01:21:06.911 --> 01:21:09.945
Are you kidding me?

01:21:09.947 --> 01:21:11.946
- Of all the lying...
- No!

01:21:11.948 --> 01:21:13.816
...two-faced, conniving,

01:21:13.818 --> 01:21:15.818
- cheating, slimy...
- Dude, are you serious?

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:16.952
...millennial bastard
hacker grifter...

01:21:16.954 --> 01:21:18.019
I'm so angry
and horny right now!

01:21:18.021 --> 01:21:19.621
...shit-stain assholes,

01:21:19.623 --> 01:21:21.193
he is the worst!

01:21:27.231 --> 01:21:30.335
But he is kinda awesome,
too, right?

01:21:52.724 --> 01:21:56.925
Albert, I'm sorry for calling
your balls skeletal.

01:21:56.927 --> 01:21:59.064
I know there's nothing
hard down there.

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:00.699
Suck it.

01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:14.509
Thanks for letting me
stay the extra two weeks.

01:22:14.511 --> 01:22:16.312
One more than agreed upon.

01:22:16.314 --> 01:22:18.848
Yeah, it was cozy, wasn't it?

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:20.452
Mmm!

01:22:23.387 --> 01:22:25.256
What will
your next chapter be?

01:22:26.524 --> 01:22:29.892
I was thinking
of going to Thailand.

01:22:29.894 --> 01:22:31.559
Maybe Bangkok

01:22:31.561 --> 01:22:33.198
or Phuket.

01:22:35.466 --> 01:22:37.098
Phuket.

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.201
No, that's not how you say it.

01:22:46.778 --> 01:22:48.309
What's this?

01:22:48.311 --> 01:22:52.013
It's your cut of the
"Lord of the Rings" con.

01:22:52.015 --> 01:22:54.717
- Oh!
- Minus expenses, of course.

01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:57.919
Wardrobe, catering,
prosthetics, et cetera.

01:22:57.921 --> 01:23:00.555
And the cost of the vases
that you broke.

01:23:00.557 --> 01:23:02.258
And the plumbing issues
I caused.

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.128
- What?
- Hmm?

01:23:15.405 --> 01:23:16.474
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:23:22.814 --> 01:23:25.748
Yello! Make a hole,
people. Make a hole.

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:27.450
'Scuse me, comin' through.

01:23:27.452 --> 01:23:29.451
Come on, Ritchie
comin' through, baby.

01:23:29.453 --> 01:23:31.821
'Scuse me, 'scuse me.
Thank you very much.

01:23:31.823 --> 01:23:33.990
Okay, yeah.
Thank you very much.

01:23:33.992 --> 01:23:35.857
All right. Okay.

01:23:35.859 --> 01:23:37.660
Intros.

01:23:37.662 --> 01:23:39.460
Cathy! Cathy, baby,
you get that

01:23:39.462 --> 01:23:40.964
rock-hard caboose
up here this minute.

01:23:40.966 --> 01:23:42.330
Ritchie, slow down!

01:23:42.332 --> 01:23:43.933
I have to catch my breath.

01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:45.000
Oh, shut it, doll.

01:23:45.002 --> 01:23:46.936
You're in mint condition
and you know it.

01:23:46.938 --> 01:23:49.504
Okay, so here's the story.

01:23:49.506 --> 01:23:53.142
I was showing Cathy here
some luxury property in Capri,

01:23:53.144 --> 01:23:54.543
when I realized
that this lady's

01:23:54.545 --> 01:23:56.178
got some high-class taste.

01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:58.347
And I don't just mean
for real estate, nope.

01:23:58.349 --> 01:24:00.215
Cathy's an animal lover, see,

01:24:00.217 --> 01:24:02.852
but she doesn't just like
regular doggies and birdies.

01:24:02.854 --> 01:24:06.555
She likes special furry
friends who are maybe, oh,

01:24:06.557 --> 01:24:08.523
a little illegal.
Is that right, Cathy?

01:24:08.525 --> 01:24:11.027
Yes it is. Now, Cathy, what is
it you wanted to start?

01:24:11.029 --> 01:24:13.028
It was a monastery
or something?

01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.630
A rare animal sanctuary
and spa.

01:24:15.632 --> 01:24:16.833
I love it.

01:24:16.835 --> 01:24:18.134
So I say to Cathy,

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:19.567
"You'll have to meet
my friends."

01:24:19.569 --> 01:24:21.102
We hopped in the dinghy,

01:24:21.104 --> 01:24:23.373
we set sail, and here we are!

01:24:23.375 --> 01:24:26.642
Cathy, I want y'all to meet
South Africa's

01:24:26.644 --> 01:24:30.345
most celebrated and discreet
endangered species dealer,

01:24:30.347 --> 01:24:32.716
Imka Bekker.

01:24:41.359 --> 01:24:42.759
Say, what's wrong, Imka?

01:24:42.761 --> 01:24:44.763
Exotic cat got your tongue?

01:24:48.099 --> 01:24:49.933
No.

01:24:49.935 --> 01:24:51.401
Howzit, Cathy?

01:24:51.403 --> 01:24:54.570
It's such a pleasure to meet
a fellow wildlife enthusiast.

01:24:54.572 --> 01:24:56.104
I love the springboks, myself.

01:24:56.106 --> 01:24:57.373
Oh! Me too. Me too.

01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:59.275
Look at me
being a total jackass.

01:24:59.277 --> 01:25:02.577
I forgot to introduce Imka's
right-hand woman.

01:25:02.579 --> 01:25:04.780
Ladies and gentlemen,
if y'all ever need

01:25:04.782 --> 01:25:07.416
a crocodile just wrestled
into submission,

01:25:07.418 --> 01:25:09.954
Sheila Malarkey is your gal.

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:14.089
Oh, but Sheila lost
her tongue tragically

01:25:14.091 --> 01:25:18.863
to a very small but ferocious
red-crested wombat.

01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:21.565
God bless her soul.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:24.567
Shame.

01:25:24.569 --> 01:25:27.238
She can sign, though.
Can't you, Sheila?

01:25:28.905 --> 01:25:30.542
Yes.

01:25:31.309 --> 01:25:32.811
Yes, she can.

01:25:38.649 --> 01:25:41.116
- Okey-dokey.
- Yoh. Okay, okay.

01:25:41.118 --> 01:25:42.250
What's she saying?

01:25:42.252 --> 01:25:43.318
Okey-dokey.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.986
She says, everyone, please,

01:25:44.988 --> 01:25:48.924
up to the house and please
enjoy some of her ice cream.

01:25:48.926 --> 01:25:50.125
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:50.127 --> 01:25:51.293
Who likes ice cream?

01:25:51.295 --> 01:25:52.562
I scream, you scream.

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:54.629
Everybody follow me,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:54.631 --> 01:25:56.499
We're headin' up this
stone path, right here.

01:25:56.501 --> 01:25:57.700
Cathy, take this.

01:25:57.702 --> 01:25:59.602
Everybody, look at Cathy.
She's the alpha dog.

01:25:59.604 --> 01:26:01.937
I want you to follow her
all the way up.

01:26:01.939 --> 01:26:04.240
Keep going! At the top,
you're gonna find a little penguin man.

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:06.009
He's gonna spark the fuse
on the barbecue, baby,

01:26:06.011 --> 01:26:08.576
'cause we're havin'
red meat, baby!

01:26:20.625 --> 01:26:23.425
This year I made $6 million.

01:26:23.427 --> 01:26:24.826
So far.

01:26:24.828 --> 01:26:25.996
Impressive.

01:26:26.697 --> 01:26:28.164
How irritating.

01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:31.200
But together,
we could make so much more.

01:26:31.202 --> 01:26:33.535
So much more.

01:26:33.537 --> 01:26:36.804
You guys are fantastic
at what you do.

01:26:36.806 --> 01:26:39.775
My nana would
absolutely love you.

01:26:39.777 --> 01:26:41.643
The three of us...

01:26:41.645 --> 01:26:43.680
that'd be one hell of a team.

01:26:50.854 --> 01:26:52.220
You played me.

01:26:52.222 --> 01:26:56.795
Penny, the only thing I never
lied about was you.

01:27:08.206 --> 01:27:09.306
Listen...

01:27:10.809 --> 01:27:12.875
First million pays us back.

01:27:12.877 --> 01:27:15.311
The second million
will be your apology.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:17.745
Yeah, and if you ever
double-cross us again,

01:27:17.747 --> 01:27:20.516
I withhold sex
for a whole year.

01:27:20.518 --> 01:27:21.717
Or six months.

01:27:21.719 --> 01:27:24.586
No, let's go with 24 hours.

01:27:24.588 --> 01:27:25.987
For like...

01:27:25.989 --> 01:27:29.558
Until midmorning,
I will not be open as a shop.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.860
- You done?
- Okay.

01:27:30.862 --> 01:27:32.762
So don't cross us ever again.

01:27:32.764 --> 01:27:34.196
Deal.

01:27:34.198 --> 01:27:36.501
So, are we doin' this?

01:27:45.944 --> 01:27:47.677
Come on!
They went down this way.

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:48.680
Hurry up!

01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.053
Damn it! We lost them.

01:27:59.055 --> 01:28:01.223
How could you lose them?

01:28:01.225 --> 01:28:03.892
How could you
give 'em Â£200,000?

01:28:03.894 --> 01:28:06.728
Uh, designer nipples
are not cheap.

01:28:06.730 --> 01:28:08.731
Plus, that's like
500 American dollars.

01:28:08.733 --> 01:28:11.467
- It really isn't.
- Hey! Hey, buddy!

01:28:11.469 --> 01:28:13.802
Did you see two women
run by here a minute ago?

01:28:13.804 --> 01:28:17.373
Oh, uh, yeah,
with massive wads of cash?

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:18.473
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:28:18.475 --> 01:28:19.741
Uh, they ran that way.

01:28:19.743 --> 01:28:21.442
Well, let's go!

01:28:21.444 --> 01:28:24.114
Come on!
Radio for backup or somethin'.

01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:37.829
Lucky Christmas dress,
you did it again.

01:28:41.164 --> 01:28:43.264
I must say, Penny,

01:28:43.266 --> 01:28:45.970
these outfits
are terribly clever.

01:28:47.304 --> 01:28:48.706
Old but gold.

01:28:50.641 --> 01:28:52.942
Happy Christmas.

01:28:52.944 --> 01:28:54.242
Thomas, I got you a present.

01:28:54.244 --> 01:28:55.477
Thank you, Santa.

01:28:55.479 --> 01:28:57.147
Oh, I'm still here.

01:32:28.324 --> 01:32:30.625
Hortense, is that
what that's used for?

01:32:30.627 --> 01:32:32.494
I don't see any butter
on that knife.

01:32:32.496 --> 01:32:35.496
Now, Enrique, you were saying
that even though you yourself

01:32:35.498 --> 01:32:38.532
have benefited economically
from immigrating to America,

01:32:38.534 --> 01:32:40.869
you don't feel
any additional Guatemalans

01:32:40.871 --> 01:32:42.403
should be allowed
into Palm Beach?

01:32:42.405 --> 01:32:45.173
Yes, I believe we're at the
tipping point in this moment...

01:32:45.175 --> 01:32:46.976
What ist thou looking at?

01:32:46.978 --> 01:32:49.344
Stop skulking in the corner.

01:32:49.346 --> 01:32:52.680
Thy had thy hand
on Rosalind's bosom!

01:32:52.682 --> 01:32:54.215
Dost thou deny it?

01:32:54.217 --> 01:32:56.384
Oh, sweet Hortense
had her suitor's body exhumed

01:32:56.386 --> 01:32:58.221
the day after he was trampled.

01:32:58.921 --> 01:33:00.421
It's folly, though.

01:33:00.423 --> 01:33:02.023
The family
will never accept him.

01:33:02.025 --> 01:33:04.092
You just don't like him
because he's black.

01:33:04.094 --> 01:33:06.861
Sister, may I please sing
my song now?

01:33:06.863 --> 01:33:08.530
Ooh, yes, of course,
darling, of course.

01:33:08.532 --> 01:33:11.398
Hortense has written a song
to celebrate our engagement.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.001
Isn't that marvelous?

01:33:13.003 --> 01:33:14.803
No, wait, I wanted the lute.

01:33:14.805 --> 01:33:16.405
It is the lute.

01:33:16.407 --> 01:33:17.408
Hmm.

01:33:19.743 --> 01:33:23.347
All right, this is
a Hortense original.

01:33:33.122 --> 01:33:34.222
<i>âª Wedding! âª</i>

01:33:38.028 --> 01:33:39.030
<i>âª Death! âª</i>

01:33:42.565 --> 01:33:45.502
She had the finest
tutors, but you can't teach talent.

01:33:47.404 --> 01:33:48.905
Bon appetit!
