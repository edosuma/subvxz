00:31.031 --> 00:32.073
Who's up tonight?

00:32.073 --> 00:33.701
I am.

00:33.701 --> 00:37.288
And I got a special surprise.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.626
Ta da!

00:41.626 --> 00:42.710
Uh oh.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.044
You play the violin?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.630
I've been taking lessons.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.715
I didn't want to say anything
until I figured out

00:47.715 --> 00:49.216
if I was gonna like it or not.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.135
That's sweet.
Not many guys play the violin.

00:51.135 --> 00:53.137
Yeah, including Andy.

00:53.137 --> 00:56.515
I've heard the sound he
makes come out of that thing.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.315
[terrible music]

01:00.686 --> 01:02.229
Ahhh!
STOP!

01:02.229 --> 01:05.858
Oh man, come on!
-Oh stop!

01:05.858 --> 01:07.234
See?

01:07.234 --> 01:09.570
Maybe you should take
up stamp collecting.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.906
Guess I sound kinda rusty.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.574
Kinda like a rusty gate.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.451
Quinn!
It wasn't that bad.

01:15.451 --> 01:17.077
Yeah it was.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.746
I know.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.123
It's hard learning to
play an instrument,

01:21.123 --> 01:23.375
and even harder to get good.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.419
It takes a ton of
practice to get

01:25.419 --> 01:28.006
where people like
listening to you.

01:28.006 --> 01:31.050
My story's about someone
who plays really well.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.719
People love to hear her play.

01:33.719 --> 01:37.473
The trouble is, one person
likes it so much that they'd do

01:37.473 --> 01:40.018
anything to get her
to play for them,

01:40.018 --> 01:43.145
and them alone.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.606
Anything.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.275
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:48.275 --> 01:51.236
I call this story...

01:59.829 --> 02:03.165
Warrenville Recreational Center
was a cool place to hang out.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.918
Anything you
wanted to do was there.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.753
Weightlifting.
Aerobic classes.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.073
Even Music.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.342
But a new strip
mall was going up

02:13.342 --> 02:14.844
and Warrenville's
days were over.

02:14.844 --> 02:18.263
Everything was about to change.

02:19.682 --> 02:21.934
Especially for Tara and her
friends.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.062
Never in their wildest
dreams would they believe

02:24.062 --> 02:26.105
something so incredibly strange

02:26.105 --> 02:30.026
was happening in a place they
called home for so long.

02:31.944 --> 02:32.794
[beautiful music]

03:21.285 --> 03:22.485
[applause]

03:30.836 --> 03:33.714
That was so beautiful, Tara.
You're amazing.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.049
Really.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.551
Yeah, so amazing I
put Michael to sleep.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.886
Michael's a jerk.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.305
What was so important
that he had to leave

03:41.305 --> 03:44.475
before you finished?

03:44.475 --> 03:45.434
Don't look at me.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.435
Scot???

03:46.435 --> 03:49.939
I... gotta go.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.322
What do you think of this one?

03:58.322 --> 03:59.573
For the program.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.200
Wow, is that your
graduation shot?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.910
Yeah.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.328
Do I look fat?

04:04.328 --> 04:05.830
Yeah.

04:05.830 --> 04:07.081
Really?

04:07.081 --> 04:10.209
No, you look great!

04:11.877 --> 04:14.713
Be cool, you're on thin ice.

04:14.713 --> 04:15.881
Hey!

04:15.881 --> 04:18.509
How are my two favorite ladies?

04:18.509 --> 04:20.719
How was your workout?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.471
I didn't tell, I swear!

04:22.471 --> 04:24.182
Look, I'm sorry.

04:24.182 --> 04:25.390
I was getting all
fidgety in there.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.726
I had to, you
know, DO something!

04:27.726 --> 04:29.269
You WERE doing something!

04:29.269 --> 04:31.147
You were listening to
your girlfriend's recital!

04:31.147 --> 04:32.982
Technically, I
think he was sleeping.

04:32.982 --> 04:34.984
You keep outta this!

04:34.984 --> 04:39.738
Tara, you know I can't
stand dead-guy music.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.324
Yeah, I know.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.785
But it's important to me.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.662
It's what I do.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.289
She's going to be famous someday
and you're going to be...

04:49.289 --> 04:50.958
workin' out.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.877
Famous?
Playing that stuff?

04:52.877 --> 04:54.045
Unlikely.

04:54.045 --> 04:56.839
Gee, thanks for the support.

04:57.882 --> 05:00.342
What's this for?

05:00.342 --> 05:02.344
They asked me to perform
at the last dance.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.971
That's for the program.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.514
Aw, don't use this one.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.557
Michael!

05:06.557 --> 05:07.975
I'm being supportive.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.728
You got WAY better
shots than that!

05:12.396 --> 05:14.732
Look out!

05:17.109 --> 05:18.652
Everybody alright?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.571
Good thing they're
closing this place man,

05:20.571 --> 05:24.533
it's fallin' apart! Come on,
let's get out of here.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.498
You're being pretty lame with
Tara, you know that, don't you?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.500
What? You want me
to lie to her?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.502
Everybody thinks they're gonna
play for some big

05:35.502 --> 05:37.421
philharmonic
doo-dah orchestra...

05:37.421 --> 05:40.632
and most of 'em end up playing
on the street for quarters.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.968
I'm just giving
her a reality check.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.720
Yeah but...you should
listen to her sometime.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.471
She's really good.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.850
I know she's good. So are the
guys playing for quarters.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.685
Whoa!
-What?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.896
Turn around.

05:53.896 --> 05:58.317
What? What happened here?

05:59.318 --> 06:01.237
There's a hole back there.

06:01.237 --> 06:04.198
Some rat's got it in for you.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.993
This place is a
disaster waiting to happen.

06:17.836 --> 06:21.006
We've had a lot of
great times here.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.342
I'm going to miss it.

06:23.342 --> 06:27.263
Yeah, well, time to move on.

06:27.263 --> 06:30.015
Maybe it's time to
move on in a lot of ways.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.433
What do you mean?

06:31.433 --> 06:34.853
I'm beginning to think
Michael and I aren't...

06:37.773 --> 06:38.493
Oh no.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.069
What's the matter?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.570
My violin's gone!

06:43.570 --> 06:44.822
Where did you put it?

06:44.822 --> 06:45.864
There!

06:45.864 --> 06:48.159
I put the violin there!

06:48.159 --> 06:49.994
But...
nobody else is here!

06:49.994 --> 06:53.580
How could it just disappear?

06:55.499 --> 06:58.543
We should go tell somebody.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.379
Let's just tell
security, alright?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.047
Yeah.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.675
C'mon...hurry.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.311
What did security do?

07:15.311 --> 07:16.687
Nothing.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.772
They took a statement
and filled out a report.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.316
Did you tell 'em
about my jacket?

07:20.316 --> 07:21.483
Michael!
-What?

07:21.483 --> 07:24.987
This cost beaucoup bucks!

07:24.987 --> 07:28.907
I can't believe it,
I've had it for years.

07:28.907 --> 07:32.203
Now I can't even play at the
last dance Saturday night.

07:32.203 --> 07:33.996
Come on, Don't they
rent those things?

07:33.996 --> 07:37.541
Those "things" are
violins, Michael.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.836
Not bowling shoes, violins!

07:46.342 --> 07:52.348
For a smart guy, you're
kinda...not very smart.

07:52.348 --> 07:53.598
Why?

07:53.598 --> 07:56.977
I know what violins are.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.624
Poor thing.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.172
Sorry Tara.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.800
Alright then! Let's get
over it and have some fun!

09:09.800 --> 09:14.846
This is a party!
Let's dance!

09:14.846 --> 09:18.725
Tara? Where are you going?

09:18.725 --> 09:21.145
What's her problem now?

09:22.146 --> 09:26.942
You are a colossal dufus!

09:28.735 --> 09:30.862
What'd I do?

09:47.587 --> 09:52.884
Tara?
Tara where are you?

10:29.713 --> 10:32.924
C'mon Tara, talk to me!

10:45.770 --> 10:46.850
Ahhhhhhh!

10:50.609 --> 10:52.110
Jane?

10:57.491 --> 10:59.284
Jane?

10:59.284 --> 11:02.287
Is that you?

11:21.723 --> 11:24.309
Ahhhhhh!!!

11:31.900 --> 11:33.652
Keep walking.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.320
Don't hurt me...

11:35.320 --> 11:36.160
Please.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.250
Be careful.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.378
Where are they?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.213
It's been twenty minutes.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.967
Plenty of time to
get over it, right?

11:56.967 --> 11:58.385
Gimme a break.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.346
Maybe they already went in.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.164
Who are you?

12:27.164 --> 12:31.084
A mistake of evolution.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.213
Do not run.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.467
The underground is treacherous.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.304
Maybe they went home.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.849
She wouldn't leave without me.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.353
Check the girl's bathroom.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.647
YOU check the girl's bathroom.

12:51.647 --> 12:52.897
Jane!

12:54.232 --> 12:55.651
What happened?

12:55.651 --> 13:00.322
Something horrible is going on.

13:01.615 --> 13:05.202
It was up there...
whatever it was.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.787
Oh man, we gotta get help.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.465
It got Tara!

13:20.258 --> 13:24.179
You guys get help.
I'm finding Tara.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.734
Do you like it?

13:36.734 --> 13:40.028
Please let me go.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.821
I won't tell anyone about you.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.990
I promise.

13:43.990 --> 13:47.077
I have something to show you.

14:07.389 --> 14:11.226
I prepared this for you.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.734
I don't have much
of an appetite.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.445
I'm sorry.
I disgust you.

14:21.445 --> 14:22.654
No!

14:22.654 --> 14:27.325
I mean...I'm just scared.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.789
What do you want with me?

14:31.789 --> 14:37.711
For years I have watched
you from behind the walls.

14:37.711 --> 14:42.966
Years preparing myself -
and all this - for you.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.054
For me?

14:48.054 --> 14:53.351
I've watched you grow up
into a fine young woman Tara...

14:53.351 --> 14:55.937
with amazing talent.

14:55.937 --> 15:00.942
I brought you here
because after tonight,

15:00.942 --> 15:07.949
the building will be torn
down and I'll lose you forever.

15:09.493 --> 15:12.162
I couldn't live like that.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.456
It was you!

15:14.456 --> 15:17.459
You dropped that
pencil in the music room!

15:17.459 --> 15:20.462
I didn't mean to
disturb your playing.

15:20.462 --> 15:24.257
I hope you will forgive me.

15:36.561 --> 15:40.732
I have something
else to show you.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.191
You!

15:43.527 --> 15:48.866
No harm has come to it.

15:50.659 --> 15:51.759
Would you play for me?

15:56.748 --> 16:00.836
If you prefer, I
will hide myself.

16:00.836 --> 16:03.380
You don't have to hide.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.507
Then you will play?

16:05.507 --> 16:07.592
If you show me your face.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.886
No! Anything but that. Please.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.261
Then I won't play.

16:10.261 --> 16:14.057
You don't understand.
I'm hideous.

16:14.057 --> 16:20.939
Anyone who can draw with such
brilliance can't be hideous.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.464
Alright then.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.996
Are you certain?

16:36.996 --> 16:37.996
Yes.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.690
I warned you.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.568
No!
Leave it off.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.863
I'm not afraid.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.315
What should I play?

17:18.789 --> 17:20.958
Pachelbel?

17:30.216 --> 17:31.066
[beautiful music]

18:34.906 --> 18:37.034
You're crying.

18:37.034 --> 18:40.954
You play beautifully.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.622
Anyone who doesn't see that...

18:42.622 --> 18:45.583
is a fool.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.091
Are you thinking of your friend?

18:53.091 --> 18:54.051
Michael?

18:55.719 --> 18:59.597
He just doesn't get it.

18:59.597 --> 19:03.643
He can't see beyond himself
to appreciate who you are.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.311
Or maybe he's right.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.773
Maybe there's no future in
playing classical music.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.526
I hope you don't mean that.

19:11.526 --> 19:14.237
I...I don't know.

19:14.237 --> 19:17.074
Stay with me, Tara.

19:17.074 --> 19:20.243
I'd never make you
give up your music.

19:20.243 --> 19:24.706
If this doesn't suit you,
there are other places in the

19:24.706 --> 19:26.875
underground that
would make a fine home.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.377
I could play all
day, couldn't I?

19:29.377 --> 19:33.339
Yes, yes!
As long as you want!

19:33.339 --> 19:36.927
I'd adore you forever!

19:39.137 --> 19:42.348
What's wrong?

19:42.348 --> 19:45.560
No one will take
her away from me!

19:45.560 --> 19:46.978
NO ONE!

19:46.978 --> 19:48.021
What is it!?

19:48.021 --> 19:49.022
Hurry!

19:49.022 --> 19:50.107
What are you doing?

19:50.107 --> 19:53.192
I'm protecting you!

19:56.738 --> 19:58.322
That's it, Quasimodo.
Show's over!

19:58.322 --> 19:59.282
Michael!

19:59.282 --> 20:00.450
Let her go!

20:00.450 --> 20:02.160
Why?
So she can go back to you?

20:02.160 --> 20:03.578
Someone who doesn't see her?

20:03.578 --> 20:04.579
Doesn't listen to her?

20:04.579 --> 20:06.372
Doesn't...love her?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.750
I don't know who...no...I
don't know what you are,

20:08.750 --> 20:10.919
but if you don't
let her go I swear-

20:10.919 --> 20:14.798
You're in my world now...be
careful where you tread.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.092
Don't go!
Please!

20:17.092 --> 20:18.135
Are you alright?

20:18.135 --> 20:21.471
Yes, I'm fine.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.101
He's harmless.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.310
He doesn't look harmless to me.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.229
C'mon! Let's get out of here.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.857
I'll have the police
down here faster than...

20:32.857 --> 20:34.275
I won't let you take her!

20:34.275 --> 20:38.696
Stop! Michael, stop! Stop it!

20:48.331 --> 20:49.540
Help him!

20:49.540 --> 20:51.751
I'm too heavy for you.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.461
Michael help me!

20:53.461 --> 20:54.462
I'm not afraid, Tara.

20:54.462 --> 20:55.463
No...

20:55.463 --> 20:56.923
Follow your dream.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.842
Promise me you won't
let anyone stop you.

20:58.842 --> 21:02.762
Listen to me.
You can't die!!!

21:02.762 --> 21:04.347
Promise me.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.807
I promise.

21:05.807 --> 21:08.226
Good bye, Tara.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.314
I got you.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.953
Thank you.

21:26.953 --> 21:31.457
I am sorry for what I did.

21:42.426 --> 21:46.097
Why did you save him?

21:50.476 --> 21:51.436
For you.

22:07.785 --> 22:08.635
[classical music]

22:24.552 --> 22:28.056
Would you like the last dance?

22:28.056 --> 22:32.351
Nothing would make me happier.

23:05.343 --> 23:06.510
The end.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.388
That was beautiful.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.142
Oh no.
-Not again!

23:12.142 --> 23:17.147
No offense man but...bye!

23:19.732 --> 23:23.569
Wait. Go for it.

23:27.365 --> 23:28.215
[beautiful music]

23:42.546 --> 23:44.299
I was just gettin' warmed up.
