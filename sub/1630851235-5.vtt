01:39.011 --> 01:40.317
-I didn't even know
he was sick.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.145
-I don't think he was.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.409
- He was really...

01:45.453 --> 01:47.585
- They were the same age.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.500
- I think he was 70.

01:49.544 --> 01:52.024
- I think he was closer to 170.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.508
- We're here today
to celebrate Joseph's life.

01:57.552 --> 02:00.250
Soldier, husband and father.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.252
He burned bright.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.124
Dedicated man who found the time

02:04.167 --> 02:05.429
to not only devote his attention

02:07.562 --> 02:12.132
- But remain a devoted man
to Catherine.

02:49.734 --> 02:52.041
- Tim, no.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.481
What have I told you
about this closet?

02:57.525 --> 02:59.657
- Not until I'm older.

02:59.701 --> 03:02.182
- That's right.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.575
Do you have any idea
how dangerous it would be

03:04.619 --> 03:06.664
if you got locked
in this closet?

03:06.708 --> 03:09.232
- Grandpa went in.
He thought I didn't see.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.669
He went in with a book,
then came back out.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.368
- Yes.

03:14.411 --> 03:18.546
Well, your grandfather forgot
that even if you

03:18.589 --> 03:22.724
can play tricks with time,
you can't cheat it.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.423
You'll understand
when you're older.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.774
Go find your mother.
She's looking for you.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.430
Oh, have you seen kitty?

03:37.608 --> 03:40.568
Oh, that's okay, I'll find him.
You run along now.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.479
- Yo.

04:22.523 --> 04:23.785
Come on, man.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.743
The test isn't until
Friday at 8.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.745
- Yeah, that's exactly why
I'm not gonna smoke any.

04:27.789 --> 04:30.139
I gotta study twice as hard
to do half as well as you.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.314
- Well, that is true.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.750
I am the smart one,
don't forget.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.491
- I didn't forget.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.188
- Do you know what you need?
- Noise-canceling headphones?

04:36.232 --> 04:39.279
- Nah, man, none of that.
What you need is to relax.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.758
Whoa. Hey, look, man.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.151
It's that girl
you never talk to.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.283
What's her name?
- Lauren?

04:43.326 --> 04:44.458
- Lauren.
- Shut up.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.329
- Look, come on.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.417
Hurry up, man.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.201
Look, see them right there.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.293
Dang, I like her friend.
- I like her.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.816
- Yeah, I know you do,
lover boy.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.470
- Stop.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.298
- Hey, look, got an idea.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.299
- You got an idea?

04:59.342 --> 05:00.822
- Yeah, just wait up here, man.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.138
- Timothy Denbrough?
- Uh, yeah.

05:13.182 --> 05:14.705
- We're delivering
from the estate of a...

05:14.749 --> 05:16.359
Catherine Denbrough?

05:16.403 --> 05:18.143
- My grandmother?
- Sign here.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.667
- Oh.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.758
Whoa, um...

05:25.890 --> 05:27.457
- Oh, and here's a letter
from your grandma.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.720
- All right, thank you, guys.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.574
- Okay.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.710
- Come on, Tim.
The party's startin' now, man.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.583
- Hi.

06:07.715 --> 06:11.196
- Lauren, this is my friend,
Tim, I was talkin' about.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.502
He's supposed to be studying
for an exam, but--

06:12.546 --> 06:15.200
- I am.
- I told him it could wait

06:15.244 --> 06:16.680
because he's actually
had a crush on you all semester.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.378
- Really?
- Oh, oh.

06:18.421 --> 06:21.250
Hey, I didn't know
that was gonna come out, hi.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.556
- Hey, listen, you wanna go
grab a drink?

06:22.599 --> 06:23.905
- Mm-hmm.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.832
- So.
- So.

06:39.268 --> 06:42.532
- Why is your heart set on law
if it's so hard?

06:42.576 --> 06:45.230
- Well, my parents had me
when they were really young

06:45.274 --> 06:47.755
just like fresh outta college.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.887
And my dad was plannin'
on going to law school,

06:49.931 --> 06:52.586
but he died in a car accident.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.589
- I'm sorry.
- No, thank you, it's uh--

06:57.373 --> 07:00.420
So I don't know,
I figure if I become

07:00.463 --> 07:04.554
a successful lawyer
and a good dad,

07:04.598 --> 07:08.428
that I'll be doing what he never
got the chance to.

07:08.471 --> 07:11.561
- Oh, okay, a lawyer and a dad.

07:11.605 --> 07:12.736
- I know, I, uh...

07:12.780 --> 07:16.261
- You've got it all planned out,
don't ya?

07:16.305 --> 07:18.742
- Well...

07:18.786 --> 07:22.398
- No, I--uh, I think
that's nice.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.533
You're nice.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.323
- Tim.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.935
Hi.
- Hi.

07:37.979 --> 07:41.765
- You're not forgetting
about the exam, are you?

07:41.809 --> 07:42.679
- Shit.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.467
Oh, I gotta go, sorry.

07:47.510 --> 07:52.341
Hey, hey, uh,
I would love to see you again.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.953
- Don't be late.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.608
- I am not gonna pass the Bar.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.697
Shit, I am not ready for this.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.664
I don't have time.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.927
- Okay, thank you, Grandma.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.484
- No way.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.488
Ah, thank you.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.964
- Right on time.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.143
What?
- Nothin'.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.885
- Okay.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.453
-Cheers.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.803
- All right.
- And cheers to you.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.632
- And you.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.025
- Let's see the ring again.
- Yes.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.506
- Ah, it's so pretty.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.681
- Thank you.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.117
- Wow, so when is
the big day, guys?

10:40.161 --> 10:41.684
- Ah, November right after
we pass the Bar, right?

10:41.728 --> 10:43.947
- Okay, I like the confidence,
man.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.775
- Do you wanna go look at
bridesmaid dresses?

10:45.819 --> 10:48.125
- I would love to.
- Thank you.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.127
- I beg to differ.
- Have fun.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.999
- Bye.
- We'll see you later.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.572
- All right, listen.

11:00.616 --> 11:01.791
So I haven't told Lauren yet,
but guess what?

11:01.835 --> 11:03.053
- What's up?
- I got a house.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.664
- Dope, man.
- Yeah, it's a mile

11:04.707 --> 11:06.491
from Wells and Brown.
It's a fixer upper.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.841
It's perfect.
- Whoa, hang on.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.538
You know that Wells and Brown
offer is only good

11:09.581 --> 11:11.583
if you pass the Bar?
- I know.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.803
I'm not worried, man.
I've been putting in the time.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.675
- Well, I hope you been puttin'
in the time when you're sleeping

11:15.718 --> 11:17.502
because you're
looking a little raggedy.

11:17.546 --> 11:18.982
- I think maybe you're just
a little worried

11:19.026 --> 11:20.505
about me doing better than you.
- Nah, man, come on.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.985
- You come on.

11:22.029 --> 11:24.205
- All right, maybe. Maybe.
- Maybe.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.163
- But a wedding,
the Bar and now a house.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.165
There's only so many hours
in a day.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.864
- That's just
the excuse people use.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.169
I'm just kiddin', man.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.520
Listen,
I appreciate the concern,

11:35.564 --> 11:39.873
but I kinda got it under
control.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.701
- Are you sure?

11:41.744 --> 11:43.703
- Yeah.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.532
- Hmm, top of your class.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.709
Editor of your law review.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.059
Good reviews with your clerkship
with Judge Meyers.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.843
What is your trick?

11:53.887 --> 11:56.019
- I am very good
at time management.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.194
- Well, keep it up.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.587
Here at Wells and Brown,

11:58.630 --> 12:00.545
we like to
be continually impressed.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.591
- And I plan on
continually impressing you.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.899
In fact, I think that one day

12:05.942 --> 12:07.727
my name is gonna be
on that sign out front.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.731
A little soon
to be making bold statements

12:11.774 --> 12:13.036
like that, don't you think?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.734
- I don't like to waste time,
sir.

12:14.777 --> 12:15.952
Especially yours.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.649
I can handle anything
you send me.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.042
- Well, I don't want
to keep you too late.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.740
Get home to your new bride.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.917
-Honey, can you bring
the other Phillips head?

12:23.960 --> 12:26.093
This one's too big
for the switch cover.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.791
- Yes, ma'am. I'll be right in.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.633
- Hey, you're the man.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.679
- On Tim's first day here,

13:30.722 --> 13:32.812
he told me
he doesn't like to waste time.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.857
- Me?
- Yeah, you. You cocky bastard.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.293
- Okay.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.295
- But I guess it's true
because he just made

13:38.339 --> 13:40.820
senior associate
in under four years.

13:40.863 --> 13:44.040
And that is faster than anyone
in the history of this firm.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.128
Congratulations, Tim.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.173
- Here, here. All right.
- Cheers.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.697
- Yeah, thanks.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.656
- I, uh--
I really appreciate it, Bob.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.833
I couldn't have done it
without any of you.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.138
And I'm lookin' forward
to the future.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.139
Thank you very much.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.837
Cheers.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.664
Wow, this looks good.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.057
- Dig in.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.059
-When are you going to
see the eye doctor?

14:47.277 --> 14:50.890
You having trouble, old man?
- No.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.246
Congratulations, it's a boy.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.906
- I got him.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.993
-All right, here you go.
Come on.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.954
Throw it. Come on, buddy.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.956
Oh, oh.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.261
Wow, good throw, Henry.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.089
Tim, what are you doing?

16:00.133 --> 16:01.917
- Yeah.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.790
- All right, you guys.
Food's ready.

16:08.184 --> 16:11.448
- Is he wearing you out?

16:11.492 --> 16:13.450
- Sorry.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.451
- Hey.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.366
- Hello.
-Hey, Tim,

16:16.410 --> 16:18.281
I'm gonna need you to close that
Halford account by Monday.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.979
- Monday?
-Yeah, Monday.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.806
I just got off the phone
with the client.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.286
- You couldn't get
a continuance?

16:23.330 --> 16:24.984
-No, I put you on this
because you said

16:25.027 --> 16:26.463
you had the time.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.465
You'll get it done if you wanna
make junior partner.

16:28.509 --> 16:31.903
- Uh, yeah, I can do it.
I have the files.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.166
-Good, I'll see you
in the morning.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.819
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, okay.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.126
- No problem. Bye.

16:37.170 --> 16:41.130
- Do you have to leave?
- No, I get to stay.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.048
- I don't know how you do it.
You're amazing.

16:47.571 --> 16:50.313
- You guys do love your cakes.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.489
It looks good.
- Yeah.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.361
You deserve it.
- Thanks, bud.

16:58.365 --> 17:01.020
- Crossing the finish line
first as always, man.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.239
I don't know how you do it.
You love it, don't you?

17:03.283 --> 17:06.155
- You know, I do love it.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.243
- Yeah, I know you do.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.157
Congratulations, man.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.506
You deserve it.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.204
Whoa, are you all right?

17:11.247 --> 17:13.162
- Yeah.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.034
- Whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.036
- Whoa, Tim. Are you okay?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.863
- Guys, I don't--

17:18.907 --> 17:20.387
- Oh, come on.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.522
- You're lucky this was
just a mini stroke.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.220
You'll recover.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.526
We'll give you some medication
for your hypertension.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.528
- I'm sorry, did you say stroke?

17:31.572 --> 17:33.182
I don't understand.

17:33.226 --> 17:36.055
I workout.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.099
I mean, I eat well.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.884
And...

17:39.928 --> 17:41.277
I don't know, I think I'm in
pretty good shape.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.062
- You are in good shape

17:43.105 --> 17:45.368
for someone about ten years
older than you are.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.544
My advice would be
to cut back on the long hours

17:47.588 --> 17:49.068
and make sure you're sleeping.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.895
A young man shouldn't be
having these issues.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.288
- He will.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.998
- Do you remember what you
said to me when we first met?

18:07.042 --> 18:09.305
You wanted to be
the lawyer and dad

18:09.349 --> 18:13.222
your father
didn't get a chance to be.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.311
You've done that.

18:15.355 --> 18:18.575
You've won, but if you want
to keep what you've won,

18:18.619 --> 18:22.275
you have to stop working
yourself into an early grave.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.452
- Can you do that?

18:27.671 --> 18:29.456
- Yes.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.608
Come on, Dad, it's your turn.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.610
-Hey, Tim.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.308
We're ready.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.615
Where are you?

19:04.317 --> 19:06.623
-Your turn.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.451
- Six.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.453
You get to get to the ladder.
- You're so good at this game.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.020
Next time you can roll for me.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.326
- All right, my turn.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.676
Two.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.113
One.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.464
Two.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.553
-Oh, you can't do that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.381
I thought I was supposed to
go right to the end.

19:25.425 --> 19:26.643
- So it'll be announced soon,

19:26.687 --> 19:28.471
but I wanted you
to hear it from me.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.517
There's a short list
for senior partner.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.171
- All right.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.652
Senior partner,
about time, man.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.524
- Tim.
- Yeah.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.703
What?

19:44.226 --> 19:45.532
What, I'm not on it?

19:46.707 --> 19:48.361
Really?

19:50.101 --> 19:51.190
Who is?

19:51.233 --> 19:52.495
- Well, Winston.
- Winston.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.193
- Avery, of course.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.327
And me.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.024
- And you?

20:00.068 --> 20:01.678
- And me.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.680
- I see.
- Look, I'm really sorry, man.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.509
- No, you earned it, buddy.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.337
Congrats.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.787
- Mia told me
about the senior partner list.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.574
- I talked to Bob.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.097
And I'm gonna fix it, I promise.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.795
- No, that's not
what I'm saying.

21:17.145 --> 21:20.322
I don't care
about senior partner.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.281
I know it's more money
and more prestige.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.109
But I don't care about that.

21:25.153 --> 21:28.112
Henry doesn't care about that.

21:28.156 --> 21:31.246
What is important to us
is the time we have together.

21:33.466 --> 21:36.425
Do you understand that?

21:36.469 --> 21:38.775
- Yeah, I do.
- Good.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.329
-Hey, Tim,
Mako Terra accounts

22:10.372 --> 22:11.460
need discovery by next week.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.157
They want discovery by when?

22:13.201 --> 22:14.463
-Wednesday, latest.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.857
-I'm sorry, that is just
not--

22:16.900 --> 22:19.468
That's not possible.

22:19.512 --> 22:21.557
-You know there's a
perception that you've lost

22:21.601 --> 22:23.646
your drive.
-That's not true.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.344
I am the same guy
that I've always been.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.737
And I have the same, exact drive
that I've always had.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.826
Well, then show me, Tim.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.654
Are you gonna get
this done on time?

22:31.698 --> 22:35.266
-Um, yeah.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.356
Good, and you know what?

22:37.399 --> 22:39.358
Don't bother coming in tomorrow
unless you get this done.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.272
You got that?

24:08.621 --> 24:10.623
- Daddy.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.625
- Hey, buddy.
- What are you doing?

24:12.668 --> 24:14.496
- What are you doing?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.455
It's30 in the morning.
You should be in bed.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.500
- I'm thirsty.
- Okay, well, go in the kitchen.

24:18.544 --> 24:19.632
I'll be right in.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.460
Go on.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.592
I'll be right after you.

24:23.636 --> 24:24.854
I love you.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.769
-Love you too.

24:53.927 --> 24:57.800
-What is important to
us is the time we have together.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.541
Do you understand that?

24:59.585 --> 25:03.502
-Your grandfather
forgot that even if you

25:03.545 --> 25:05.982
can play tricks with time,
you can't cheat it.

25:06.026 --> 25:07.680
-You wanted to be
the lawyer and dad

25:07.723 --> 25:09.856
your father
didn't get the chance to be.

25:09.899 --> 25:11.510
-Find the time to get it
done.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.989
-Well, I hope you've been
putting in the time

25:13.033 --> 25:14.643
in your sleep because you're
lookin' a little raggedy.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.645
-- You are in good shape.
-- But if you want--

25:16.689 --> 25:18.342
-Someone about ten
years older than you are.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.344
-- --to stop working.
-- Do you have to leave?

25:36.578 --> 25:37.710
-No, no, no, no.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.668
Oh, shit.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.851
-Oh, shit.
- Dad?

25:48.895 --> 25:50.897
Dad.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.856
- Henry. Henry.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.902
Henry.

25:55.945 --> 26:01.037
Henry! Henry!

26:01.081 --> 26:03.692
Henry.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.870
Henry.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.472
- Dad.

26:44.515 --> 26:47.954
Dad. Where are you?

26:49.564 --> 26:51.131
Hello?

26:52.959 --> 26:54.482
Dad?

27:23.685 --> 27:26.688
- Aah.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.056
-All right, everybody.

27:47.100 --> 27:50.538
We're goin' live at five,
four, three...

27:51.844 --> 27:53.149
- Thanks, Jennifer.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.499
Horlex University officials
also confirmed

27:55.543 --> 27:57.850
the rediscovery
of what they're calling

27:57.893 --> 28:01.680
the carpenter Arctic
exploration collection.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.160
I don't know what that is,
but it sure sounds exciting.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.553
Don't you think, Murph?

28:05.596 --> 28:06.989
- Sure does. If it were me,

28:07.033 --> 28:09.818
I'd have opened
those crates yesterday.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.559
Moving onto our final story.

28:11.602 --> 28:14.214
Now this is a fun one, Serese.
The little town of Oakwood

28:14.257 --> 28:16.172
at the north end
of Castle County

28:16.216 --> 28:18.697
is gearing up
for a big event this Friday.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.611
Mac Kamen has the report.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.614
-If you're up
on your Maine myths,

28:23.658 --> 28:25.007
you know that
the town of Oakwood

28:25.051 --> 28:27.706
has quite
the mysterious history.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.185
It's well known
around these parts

28:29.229 --> 28:32.623
that back in 1821,
200 years ago,

28:32.667 --> 28:36.192
the entire town of Oakwood
up and vanished.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.542
Every single resident.

28:38.586 --> 28:42.198
A real mystery for the ages
you might say.

28:42.242 --> 28:45.767
Here in Oakwood
every citizen has a theory.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.857
- Smallpox wiped the whole
kit and kaboodle off the map.

28:48.901 --> 28:51.947
That or bubonic plague,
possibly leprosy.

28:51.991 --> 28:56.038
- It had to be the Indian raids,
the Maliseet, the Mi'kmaq.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.953
Personally, I still don't trust
none of them.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.868
- Aliens, what else makes sense?

28:59.912 --> 29:02.044
They aliened down
in their alien saucer.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.046
Tractor beamed
the whole village.

29:04.090 --> 29:07.093
Then aliened them off
to do their probing and whatnot.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.790
The truth behind the mystery

29:08.834 --> 29:12.054
might finally
be revealed this Friday.

29:12.098 --> 29:14.274
-I like to think
finding the journals

29:14.317 --> 29:16.580
was pure serendipity.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.887
-Marnie Wrightson's
not just the mayor's daughter.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.759
She's Oakwood's librarian

29:20.802 --> 29:23.587
and president
of the Historical Society.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.285
While cleaning
the library basement,

29:25.328 --> 29:27.809
Marnie Rightson
found her holy grail--

29:27.853 --> 29:30.116
a stack of Oakwood journals
from the 1800s

29:30.159 --> 29:32.901
written by a man
named Eli Lester.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.903
-I must've moved
those boxes 100 times,

29:34.947 --> 29:37.906
but something drew me in
this time.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.778
- And I hear you've barely
put the journals down

29:39.821 --> 29:41.170
over the last few days.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.259
- It's like a crash course
in Oakwood's history.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.087
- I understand
the icing on the cake

29:45.131 --> 29:47.089
was the discovery of the
etched coordinates

29:47.133 --> 29:49.265
on the back
of Eli Lester's final journal.

29:49.309 --> 29:50.919
Where did that lead?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.921
- We dug up a section of
Flag's Park next to the school.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.271
And wouldn't you know it?
We found a time capsule.

29:55.315 --> 29:57.926
The people of this town
are electric with anticipation.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.101
- Amazing.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.103
You're a veritable
Sherlock Holmes.

30:01.147 --> 30:04.628
- Well, I mean, my dad wanted me
to go into politics like him,

30:04.672 --> 30:06.326
but there's three things
that I love.

30:06.369 --> 30:07.980
I mean, I love books.
I love history.

30:08.023 --> 30:10.286
And I love a good mystery.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.158
And Oakwood's got all three.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.724
- All clear.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.814
- Oh, God.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.033
I sounded so cheesy.

30:18.077 --> 30:20.731
A big, stupid bowl
of liquid cheese.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.298
Can I try again?

30:22.342 --> 30:24.866
- Oh, our viewers love
their kickers doused in cheese.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.825
Trust me.
- What's a kicker?

30:26.868 --> 30:30.132
- Oh, that's the fluff story
at the end of a news broadcast.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.004
It leaves people feeling good,
you know?

30:32.047 --> 30:35.659
One-legged ostrich
befriends acne-ridden crocodile.

30:35.703 --> 30:39.141
Local boy sets Guinness record
for wearing 300 pairs of pants.

30:39.185 --> 30:42.057
- Three hundred at once?

30:42.101 --> 30:44.059
- Yeah, talented kid.

30:47.367 --> 30:50.674
- Uh, anyway, I'll be doin'
kickers here all week

30:50.718 --> 30:53.155
before goin' live
for Friday's big reveal.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.853
- You'll be here all week?
- Yeah.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.681
I'm stayin' at the Oakwood B&B.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.031
- All right, one-legged ostrich.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.337
Quit befriending
the acne-ridden crocodile.

31:01.381 --> 31:03.862
- So you wanna show us
the dig site?

31:03.905 --> 31:05.167
How'd you find it anyway?

31:05.211 --> 31:08.779
- Oh, easy.
I called a cartographer.

31:08.823 --> 31:12.000
The back of Eli Lester's
final journal has coordinates.

31:21.053 --> 31:24.012
- Uh.
- Ah.

31:32.978 --> 31:36.024
-That's the same year
the town vanished, right?

31:36.068 --> 31:40.376
- I'm having trouble deciphering
Eli Lester's final entry.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.726
But I'm gonna crack it.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.337
I've got a hunch the townsfolk

31:44.380 --> 31:48.732
back in 1821, left a record
of why they abandoned Oakwood.

31:48.776 --> 31:53.041
And left it in that box.
We'll find out on Friday.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.042
- You don't think
there's a chance

31:54.086 --> 31:56.915
it could be a bust, do you?

31:56.958 --> 31:58.917
Like Al Capone's vault.

31:58.960 --> 32:03.443
- Well, if that happens,
absolutely blast it with cheese.

32:03.486 --> 32:06.054
All right?
- Okay.

32:09.318 --> 32:10.972
-Okay, kids.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.757
I know Mrs. Gomez
gave you all assignments

32:13.801 --> 32:16.412
to guess what's
in the time capsule.

32:16.456 --> 32:20.068
What do you think is in the box?

32:20.112 --> 32:22.244
- If I had a box,
I'd put toys in it.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.420
- I think they put in
lists of friends

32:24.464 --> 32:27.946
in order of how they liked them
with Jackie at the bottom.

32:27.989 --> 32:29.251
- My dad has a box

32:29.295 --> 32:31.079
and there's lady pictures in it.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.342
And none of them are mommy.

32:33.386 --> 32:37.781
- Well, I think
that this is a mystery.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.958
And we will learn more
and more about our ancestors

32:40.001 --> 32:42.003
once we open up the box.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.093
- What's that?

32:45.137 --> 32:47.835
- Well, if you believe
Eli Lester,

32:47.878 --> 32:52.840
the 1821 disappearance
is only part of the story.

32:52.883 --> 32:57.801
This part of Eli's journal says
that another 200 years back,

32:57.845 --> 33:00.804
around 1621,
there was a different vanishing.

33:00.848 --> 33:03.503
- What happened to those people?

33:06.854 --> 33:07.986
- Whoops.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.813
Uh-oh.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.390
Oh, probably nothing.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.310
- That seemed to me like you
were holding somethin' back.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.051
- Well, they're kids.

33:30.095 --> 33:33.054
I don't want them
having nightmares about...

33:33.098 --> 33:34.925
- About what?
- In his last entry,

33:34.969 --> 33:38.407
Lester writes how he begged
town's folk to open that box.

33:38.451 --> 33:41.019
He says it was
their only hope for

33:41.062 --> 33:43.847
something that I can't make out.
It's not just that.

33:43.891 --> 33:46.328
The symbols in that last slide,

33:46.372 --> 33:49.897
I feel like
I've seen them somewhere before.

33:49.940 --> 33:53.074
- You're sayin' there's some
kind of protection in that box?

33:53.118 --> 33:54.510
From what?

33:54.554 --> 33:57.426
Hey, where are you goin'?

33:57.470 --> 33:59.341
What is it?

34:06.392 --> 34:09.047
Hey, is everything okay?

34:09.090 --> 34:11.353
- I don't know.

34:11.397 --> 34:15.575
Friday's 200 years to the day
since the capsule was buried.

34:15.618 --> 34:18.882
And I don't think
we can wait that long.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.198
- Where are you going?

34:52.133 --> 34:53.569
Mac, Carmella, good?

34:53.613 --> 34:55.005
-- Rolling.
-- Uh-huh.

34:55.049 --> 34:56.572
-Look, I know you can't
put this on air.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.270
-Well, don't worry,
there's other routes.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.402
Viral videos.
We'll get the truth out there.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.235
- Everyone needs to see this.

35:07.279 --> 35:10.108
I took this
from the Historical Society.

35:10.151 --> 35:13.111
I never understood
what it meant until now.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.418
- Huh.

35:18.507 --> 35:19.943
- Well, I'll be.

35:19.987 --> 35:21.597
- Mi'kmaq art, circa guess when?

35:21.641 --> 35:23.425
1421.

35:23.469 --> 35:26.167
Yet another 200 years back.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.997
We're talking 600 years
of Oakwood getting wiped out.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.304
There comes a point when things

35:32.347 --> 35:35.176
can't just be
coincidence anymore, Mac.

36:02.682 --> 36:04.379
- On Friday, it will come again.

36:04.423 --> 36:07.991
And this thing, it doesn't
just scare us from town.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.994
It doesn't just
infect us with some bug.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.474
I mean, it slaughters us.

36:12.518 --> 36:13.997
Do you understand?

36:14.041 --> 36:16.652
It is going to kill
every fucking one of us.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.480
I found those journals.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.308
It is up to me
to save this town.

36:20.352 --> 36:23.181
- Hey, it's not just up to you.

36:23.224 --> 36:26.706
I'm with you every step,
my acne-ridden crocodile.

36:28.098 --> 36:30.231
- My one-legged ostrich.

36:34.235 --> 36:37.717
-78285,
code 6, 105 North Avenue 52.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.205
-Something is coming
from the woods,

36:47.248 --> 36:49.207
Eli Lester writes,
that our only hope

36:49.250 --> 36:51.426
at fighting back
is inside that box.

36:51.470 --> 36:54.342
He buried it,
so we could use it.

36:54.386 --> 36:56.692
I mean, I don't know
if it's some spell or--

36:56.736 --> 36:59.042
- Darlin', a spell?

36:59.086 --> 37:01.567
I raised you better than that.
- Don't darlin' me, Dad.

37:01.610 --> 37:04.744
Everyone here is in danger
if we don't do something.

37:04.787 --> 37:06.441
- I'm sorry about this, Marnie,

37:06.485 --> 37:09.052
but I have
a celebration to plan.

37:09.096 --> 37:11.446
- Really?
- Hey, take your hands off her.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.274
She has a right to speak.

37:16.103 --> 37:19.715
- Because WGON is right here
in Castle County.

37:19.759 --> 37:23.066
And because folks in my town
like being on TV,

37:23.110 --> 37:24.546
I've decided to extend to you

37:24.590 --> 37:27.636
some of our
famous Oakwood hospitality.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.377
- Is that how
you treat your own daughter?

37:29.421 --> 37:32.075
- You do your story today,
your live shot tomorrow.

37:32.119 --> 37:34.164
Then high tail it out, ya hear?

37:34.208 --> 37:36.602
No more of my daughter's
creative theories.

37:36.645 --> 37:39.082
She just needs a minute
to get her head on straight.

37:39.126 --> 37:41.737
Nabbing artifacts
from the Historical Society.

37:41.781 --> 37:44.305
Diggin' up private property
in the middle of the night.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.264
There's only so much
a father can tolerate.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.091
- And what about
the people of this town?

37:48.135 --> 37:50.398
They are your responsibility.
- What?

37:50.442 --> 37:53.401
You're worried about
a 200-year old boogeyman?

37:53.445 --> 37:56.317
I care about these people, okay?

37:56.361 --> 37:58.101
I care about my daughter.

37:58.145 --> 38:01.104
All you need to know, Romeo,
is everything is on schedule

38:01.148 --> 38:04.107
for a good,
wholesome event on Friday.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.588
And both of y'all are invited.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.435
- So, Mac,
tonight's the big night.

38:27.479 --> 38:29.437
What's the vibe there?

38:29.481 --> 38:31.613
- Well, Serese,
with just hours left

38:31.657 --> 38:34.442
before Oakwood opens
its very own time capsule,

38:34.486 --> 38:36.792
excitement is at a fever pitch.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.794
Everyone, and I mean everyone

38:38.838 --> 38:41.841
is lined up
for this evening's festivities.

38:41.884 --> 38:44.147
Most of us are excited.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.237
We're really excited
to see what's in there

38:47.281 --> 38:48.804
and to come home.

38:48.848 --> 38:51.459
Really looking forward
to coming home, guys.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.204
- Welcome all.

38:57.247 --> 39:00.250
What a joy it is to see all
these beautiful Oakwood faces.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.165
Now because this
is being carried live,

39:02.209 --> 39:04.342
I'm gonna dispense with my usual
blah, blah, blah

39:04.385 --> 39:05.734
and get right down to it.

39:05.778 --> 39:10.217
Let's see what our forefathers
left us, shall we?

39:15.570 --> 39:17.355
- Stop. Dad, stop!

39:18.791 --> 39:19.705
- Huh?

39:19.748 --> 39:22.403
- I figured it out.

39:22.447 --> 39:25.667
- Oh, girl. What are you doin'?

39:25.711 --> 39:27.843
- I translated the last entry.

39:27.887 --> 39:32.326
Eli Lester, he was
a historian just like me.

39:34.546 --> 39:37.200
He adored Oakwood.
He raised his family here.

39:37.244 --> 39:40.247
He knew everything
about its history.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.607
- But when his daughter
was murdered by a town elder,

39:52.651 --> 39:55.436
they let him go free.

39:55.480 --> 39:59.397
He decided to use what he knew
about Oakwood's past against it.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.921
He convinced the town council
that they needed

40:01.964 --> 40:04.271
what was inside
that ancient box

40:04.314 --> 40:08.231
in order to keep
the 200-year curse at bay

40:08.275 --> 40:10.930
when it was quite the opposite.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.714
Eli tricked them, dad.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.716
Now he's tricked me too.

40:14.760 --> 40:17.327
There's nothing in the woods
coming to get us.

40:17.371 --> 40:18.894
- Get her out of here.
Out of town.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.548
- Dad! No!

40:20.592 --> 40:22.420
We have to get away.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.945
- Get my daughter
out of town, now!

40:27.642 --> 40:29.470
- Everyone, get away!

40:31.298 --> 40:33.431
- Mac!
-Marnie.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.563
- It's not a time capsule.

40:35.607 --> 40:38.261
It's a gate!

40:38.305 --> 40:40.612
- Everyone run, run!

40:47.314 --> 40:48.750
- Dad, wah!

40:53.886 --> 40:55.975
- I told you it was aliens!

41:02.024 --> 41:03.939
- Carmella, get to the news van.

41:03.983 --> 41:04.984
Go!

41:09.510 --> 41:13.340
Uh! Ah!

41:13.383 --> 41:15.473
Open the door! Open the door!

41:16.996 --> 41:18.954
Open the--hey.

41:27.659 --> 41:31.358
- Carmella. Uh, ah!

41:33.839 --> 41:35.884
- No!

41:45.024 --> 41:47.330
-Faster, go, go faster.

41:52.553 --> 41:55.338
- Uh!

42:00.387 --> 42:03.346
- Get out of my town.

42:03.390 --> 42:04.870
Ah!

42:08.700 --> 42:09.875
- Aah!

42:21.582 --> 42:22.670
- Oh, my God.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.027
- Ah!

42:32.071 --> 42:35.465
I'm sorry.
Please, I'm so sorry.

42:37.816 --> 42:39.382
I didn't mean--

42:40.732 --> 42:42.951
- I didn't know.

43:19.161 --> 43:21.120
- Thanks for that report, Mac.

43:21.773 --> 43:24.819
That's all for the
WGON 5 p.m. newscast.

43:24.863 --> 43:26.734
Join us at 10
when Jennifer Lunt

43:26.778 --> 43:28.736
will tell us exactly
what's been found

43:28.780 --> 43:30.912
at the bottom of Rider's Quarry.
