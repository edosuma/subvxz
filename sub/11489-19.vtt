Now*********** does
that suggest?

01:26.308 --> 01:28.903
I feel like I should
know this one.

01:29.407 --> 01:31.611
Take your time.

01:32.775 --> 01:36.680
Older, nurturing, warm...

01:36.707 --> 01:38.721
Mrs. Butterworth?

01:39.248 --> 01:43.012
Charlie, this woman you're
seeing is a mother figure.

01:43.025 --> 01:44.530
A mother figure?

01:44.546 --> 01:48.112
I said she's warm,
nurturing, and supportive.

01:48.127 --> 01:52.813
The words "toxic she-devil"
did not pass my lips.

01:52.826 --> 01:57.023
My point is, because your real mother
didn't give you what you
need emotionally,

01:57.038 --> 01:59.382
you're responding to it
in this relationship.

01:59.406 --> 02:03.222
No, no, no, no, no,
this is not a mother thing.

02:03.238 --> 02:06.102
Now, my brother alan--
he's the needy one.

02:06.127 --> 02:10.871
He practically wants to sit in this
woman's lap and breastfeed, and not in
the fun way.

02:12.125 --> 02:13.423
So alan's met her?

02:13.446 --> 02:18.193
Yeah, and he's clinging to her like a
tree monkey, which is really pissing
me off.

02:18.208 --> 02:23.531
So you're competing with your brother
for the attention of an older,
nurturing woman?

02:24.497 --> 02:27.451
Boy, you're just a one-string banjo,
aren't you?

02:27.476 --> 02:28.460
What do you want me
to tell you, charlie?

02:28.496 --> 02:30.561
I can only play the
notes in front of me.

02:30.586 --> 02:34.213
I want you to cut through all the
psychobabble and tell me why I'm
so confused.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.611
I just did.

02:35.627 --> 02:37.492
You're gonna stick with
the mother thing, huh?

02:37.506 --> 02:40.783
Plink, plink, plink.

02:40.796 --> 02:42.692
Look, charlie,
I've got my next patient waiting.

02:42.706 --> 02:46.103
If you like, we can make a weekly
appointment and really explore
these issues.

02:46.128 --> 02:49.313
In fact,
twice a week might not be overdoing it.

02:49.338 --> 02:52.113
No, thanks, I prefer to deal
with my demons as they escape.

02:52.147 --> 02:54.372
All right.

02:54.385 --> 02:55.640
So what do I owe you?

02:55.667 --> 02:58.153
Well, I get $200 an hour.
You were here for five minutes.

02:58.167 --> 03:01.533
So why don't we just
round it off and say $200.

03:03.398 --> 03:06.970
Man. Even hookers prorate.

03:06.988 --> 03:10.802
Hookers don't have to listen to you,
charlie. Good-bye.

03:14.118 --> 03:16.681
Good-bye, doc. Good session.

03:27.255 --> 03:29.611
Thanks for seeing
me last-minute.

03:33.637 --> 03:35.661

my brother's girlfriend.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.620
Oh, don't you look handsome.

03:55.648 --> 03:57.153
Nah.

03:57.165 --> 03:59.280
Yes, you do.

03:59.315 --> 04:02.473
And that shirt
looks great on you.

04:02.495 --> 04:03.190
You think?

04:03.215 --> 04:05.812
Oh, yes, very grown-up.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.060
Well, you bought it for me.

04:08.075 --> 04:10.411
But you should tuck
it in, sweetie.

04:10.436 --> 04:12.443
I don't wanna.

04:12.876 --> 04:14.430
Please.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.301
Oh, all right.

04:17.016 --> 04:18.142
Are you ready to go?

04:18.176 --> 04:20.382
I just need a minute.
Come on in.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.393
You remember my son, jeremy.

04:23.418 --> 04:24.430
Oh, sure.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.541
- Oh, hey, man, how's it going?
- Hi, good. Good to see you.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.101
And this is his
fiancee, tricia.

04:35.628 --> 04:38.993
Hi, tricia. Charlie.

04:39.435 --> 04:42.683
Hi, charlie. Nice to meet you

04:43.588 --> 04:45.133
Mom's helping us
plan our wedding.

04:45.145 --> 04:47.060
Really? You're getting married?

04:47.078 --> 04:48.540
Lucky guy.

04:48.555 --> 04:51.633
Not that I'd know. I'M...
I'm just assuming.

04:52.007 --> 04:53.760
I'm just gonna get my purse.

04:53.778 --> 04:56.772
Hurry back-- hop, hop, hop.

04:58.556 --> 05:02.311
So, you're getting married.
Taking the plunge.

05:02.325 --> 05:05.310
I've never stuck
a toe in myself.

05:05.338 --> 05:08.010
Actually, I've never
stuck anything in.

05:10.638 --> 05:12.890
But anyway, it's A...
it's a big step.

05:12.905 --> 05:15.042
Not for me.
Tricia's the love of my life.

05:15.055 --> 05:18.090
I can't believe nobody
snapped her up before I did.

05:18.468 --> 05:21.321
E right snapper.

05:23.368 --> 05:28.981
I mean, the past isn't nearly as
imrtpoant as the future you two are
gonna build together, am I right?

05:28.995 --> 05:32.642
Absolutely, the past
doesn't matter.

05:32.675 --> 05:35.293
That's what I'm thinking.

05:35.655 --> 05:37.173
Okay, let's go

05:37.196 --> 05:39.732
Okay, nice seeing you again.
Nice meeting you. Bye.

05:39.745 --> 05:41.673
Isn't she terrific?
I am so happy he...

05:41.687 --> 05:44.222
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's a catch.
Let's go.

05:50.206 --> 05:52.732
Why aren't you studying
for your algebra final?

05:52.746 --> 05:55.123
I don't have to.

05:55.135 --> 05:56.923
You don't have to
study algebra?

05:56.955 --> 06:00.292
Nope, all I gotta do is get
a 67 to pass the course,

06:00.306 --> 06:03.822
and then it's adios, seventh grade,
arrivederci, eighth.

06:06.205 --> 06:10.560
Okay, we can cross "un
interpreter" off the job list.

06:10.585 --> 06:12.731
But let's get back to
the algebra test. So...

06:12.746 --> 06:15.633
So you're planning
on getting a 67?

06:15.655 --> 06:18.861
Yep, anything above that
would be a wasted effort.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.481
Okay, we have to talk.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.762
Hey, the blind,
one-armed dancer is about to go on.

06:26.047 --> 06:29.030
- This is more important.
- Last week, she fell twice.

06:29.047 --> 06:30.321
Listen to me.

06:30.338 --> 06:35.112
You know what you call someone who just
skates through life doing only the
bare minimum?

06:35.127 --> 06:37.142
Uncle charlie?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.550
You call him a slacker.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.121
Whatev.

06:43.138 --> 06:45.063
"Whatev"?

06:45.086 --> 06:49.163
Are you now so lazy you can't
even be bothered to finish words?

06:49.177 --> 06:51.352
What's your prob?

06:51.366 --> 06:53.580
Won't you be happy if I
just get into eighth grade?

06:53.618 --> 06:56.353
I mean,
isn't that the whole point of seventh?

06:56.378 --> 06:59.282
No, that is not the
whole point of seventh.

06:59.305 --> 07:02.420
And yes, I'll be thrilled
if you're not left back.

07:02.446 --> 07:05.390
So relax, it's all good.

07:05.405 --> 07:07.952
Don't you mean it's all "guh"?

07:09.425 --> 07:12.620
Holy crap, her arm flew off.

07:13.585 --> 07:15.961
That's gotta cost them points.

07:19.485 --> 07:21.482
Yeah, two adults for
the wings of love.

07:21.497 --> 07:23.162
No, wait, I...
I get a senior discount.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.870
No, you don'T.
Full price, both of us.

07:25.887 --> 07:28.293
Charlie, you're being silly.

07:28.306 --> 07:31.663
For two bucks, let me be silly.

07:32.736 --> 07:34.732
Charlie.

07:34.748 --> 07:36.560
Oh, perfect.

07:36.577 --> 07:39.390
We're at the same theater.
What a happy coincidence.

07:39.402 --> 07:42.560
Yeah, just like
booth and lincoln.

07:42.577 --> 07:45.185
Angie, this is my mother, evelyn.
Mom, this is angie.

07:45.191 --> 07:47.286
Nice to meet you, evelyn.
I've heard a lot about you.

07:47.299 --> 07:52.713
Oh, well, there's two sides to every
story, and charlie's memory isn't the
best. You know...

07:54.105 --> 07:57.723
Well, considering how you raised me,
it was either... or...

07:59.807 --> 08:01.730
Charlie, don't be so sensitive.

08:01.745 --> 08:04.730
Have you met his brother?
Another drama queen.

08:05.175 --> 08:07.233
Okay, mom,
always great bumping into you.

08:07.258 --> 08:10.121
Maybe next time you'll be standing
in front of a wood chipper.

08:10.887 --> 08:12.162
Enjoy the movie.

08:12.176 --> 08:13.741
Bye.

08:13.755 --> 08:15.511
Hey, charlie.

08:15.538 --> 08:19.180
Oh, swell, there's more.
I'll meet you inside.

08:20.118 --> 08:22.003
Yes?

08:22.018 --> 08:24.511
Be careful.
That woman is a cougar.

08:24.525 --> 08:25.653
A what?

08:25.676 --> 08:28.522
An older woman who
preys on young men.

08:28.546 --> 08:30.431
It'S... that's not
what this is about.

08:30.445 --> 08:33.360
Right, she likes
you for your brains.

08:34.107 --> 08:36.923
And I love you for your warmth.

08:36.936 --> 08:39.712
Nice yanking chains
with you, mom.

08:40.878 --> 08:44.301
Now, what did I do
to deserve that?

08:45.075 --> 08:46.212
Here are your keys, evelyn.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.010
Thanks, justin.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.770
So, what movie should we see?

08:50.788 --> 08:53.290
Oh, you pick, darling.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.950
You're the one who'll
be facing the screen.

09:02.828 --> 09:06.872
Okay, um, "x" is... -4?

09:08.097 --> 09:10.461
Great! You're right!

09:10.475 --> 09:12.420
See, see, you can do this.

09:12.436 --> 09:16.180
Now, now, on the test, you're gonna have
to show your work, so let's see
your work.

09:16.377 --> 09:18.940
There's no work.

09:18.955 --> 09:20.522
Why is there no work?

09:20.538 --> 09:24.382
I don't need to do the work. Suddenly,
I can see all the numbers in my head.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.420
Really?

09:26.436 --> 09:28.092
Yeah, it's amazing.

09:28.108 --> 09:29.390
And they all make
perfect sense.

09:29.407 --> 09:32.710
It's like the equations are
solving themselves before my eyes.

09:32.737 --> 09:35.861
Oh, my god, you know, I... I've read
about that kind of thing, but...

09:35.878 --> 09:38.863
My own son?

09:39.066 --> 09:41.960
Nah, I'm just
screwing with you.

09:45.896 --> 09:48.972
The answers are in
the back of the book.

09:49.986 --> 09:52.241
Good night.

09:52.256 --> 09:55.801
You should've seen your face
when you thought I was smart.

09:58.996 --> 10:02.141
Am I supposed to go to bed now?

10:03.597 --> 10:05.890
Dad?

10:05.907 --> 10:07.271
I still love him.

10:07.287 --> 10:08.732
I still love him.

10:08.746 --> 10:11.681
I still love him. I...

10:19.136 --> 10:21.820
You're only punishing yourself.
Let it go.

10:21.838 --> 10:22.941
Easy for you to say.

10:22.967 --> 10:27.123
Your mom wasn't four rows behind you in
a movie theater dry-humping a cub scout.

10:30.035 --> 10:32.790
Oh, hey, I, uh...

10:32.806 --> 10:34.052
I didn't hear you guys come in.

10:34.076 --> 10:35.721
Uh, how'd you like
wings of love?

10:35.736 --> 10:36.862
Oh, it was terrific.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.693
Oh, you know,
I thought you'd enjoy the movie.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.471
You know, it's the same cinematographer
as like water for chocolate.

10:41.486 --> 10:43.082
Yeah, swell,
would you like some wine?

10:43.105 --> 10:44.002
I'd love some.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.482
Here's ten bucks.
Go get yourself a bottle.

10:47.148 --> 10:49.682
Gee, thanks,
but I can't go out now.

10:50.997 --> 10:53.300
I, uh...
I just put my little boy to bed.

10:53.315 --> 10:54.603
You got a little boy?

10:54.626 --> 10:57.082
Aren't you afraid
jake will eat him?

10:58.178 --> 11:00.250
How do you like
being a father, alan?

11:00.268 --> 11:03.463
Oh, well, you know, I'd-I'd have to
say that it's wonderfully rewarding

11:03.476 --> 11:05.710
and-and more than a
little challenging.

11:05.727 --> 11:07.543
Jake's kind of a
diamond in the rough.

11:07.555 --> 11:10.261
Jake's kind of a turd
in the punchbowl.

11:10.275 --> 11:13.022
Charlie, that is no way
to talk about a child.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.123
He's not a child.

11:14.137 --> 11:17.383
He's a postpubescent
tapeworm with a bad haircut.

11:17.407 --> 11:19.751
Charlie!

11:19.767 --> 11:21.692
Was your divorce
very hard on him?

11:21.717 --> 11:22.780
You have no idea.

11:22.806 --> 11:25.562
I'll tell you who his
divorce was hard on: Me.

11:25.575 --> 11:26.760
Oh, stop playing the martyr.

11:26.776 --> 11:28.562
- Stop living in my house.
- Here we go.

11:28.578 --> 11:31.463
You keep saying that,
but you never go.

11:31.475 --> 11:34.871
I think I'll just
go powder my nose.

11:37.247 --> 11:38.912
You see what you did?
You drove her away.

11:38.926 --> 11:41.871
Oh, I drove her away? I'm not the one
with the insults and the poop talk.

11:41.886 --> 11:45.072
- Poop talk?
- You called my son a turd in a punchbowl.

11:45.088 --> 11:47.281
I said it with love.

11:48.196 --> 11:50.510
Anyway, I know what's going on here,
and it's not gonna work.

11:50.548 --> 11:51.760
Angie's with me.

11:51.788 --> 11:52.873
Hey, she's my friend, too.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.003
Yeah, well,
she and I are more than friends.

11:55.017 --> 11:57.223
Oh, really?
Have you slept with her?

11:57.236 --> 11:59.030
That's none of your business.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.280
Oh, my god, you haven'T.

12:01.298 --> 12:03.530
I was just taking
a shot in the dark.

12:03.546 --> 12:05.960
No, that's your sex life.

12:05.976 --> 12:09.280
All I know is, if you haven't slept
with angie, it's a level playing field.

12:09.297 --> 12:11.312
- You think so?
- I do.

12:13.206 --> 12:14.793
Oh, hey, what are we doing?

12:14.805 --> 12:16.473
We're going upstairs.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.651
Okey-dokey. Good night, alan.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.772
Night.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.123
Hey, alan?

12:32.378 --> 12:33.291
Morning.

12:33.306 --> 12:34.820
What's good about it?

12:34.837 --> 12:36.973
I didn't say "good. "

12:38.008 --> 12:40.173
Hey, why aren't you
studying for your test?

12:40.195 --> 12:42.463
I thought we settled this, dad.

12:42.756 --> 12:45.663
Turn off the tv.
Go to your room and study.

12:46.837 --> 12:48.533
He'll never learn.

12:48.546 --> 12:50.483
Hey, I heard that!

12:50.498 --> 12:51.320
So?

12:51.335 --> 12:54.941
So, I'm an adult!
I don't have to learn anything!

12:56.085 --> 12:57.840
What's bugging you, zippy?

12:57.865 --> 13:00.771
Your blow-up doll run
off with a pool toy?

13:05.465 --> 13:08.851
Just mind your business
and do your job.

13:14.405 --> 13:16.723
Want to rephrase that?

13:17.225 --> 13:19.110
Desperately.

13:20.328 --> 13:22.040
Good morning, everyone.

13:22.055 --> 13:23.893
Well, at least somebody's
in a good mood.

13:23.907 --> 13:29.322
Well, I'm not usually one to kiss and
tell, but... boing! Wubba-wubba-wubba!

13:34.186 --> 13:36.922
So who's the lucky receptacle?

13:38.368 --> 13:41.492
Do not talk about angie that way.
She's a lady!

13:41.505 --> 13:42.740
During the day.

13:42.768 --> 13:46.681
But once the lights go down...
boing! Wubba-wubba-wubba!

13:47.315 --> 13:49.743
All right, fine.
We get the picture.

13:49.758 --> 13:53.000
Oh, I don't think you do.

13:53.016 --> 13:57.442
She left an hour ago, but it took me
till now to safely zip up my pants.

13:59.557 --> 14:03.211
You know, there are parts of angie
that could sue disneyland for claiming

14:03.225 --> 14:05.653
it's the happiest
place on earth.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.460
Oh, go to hell.

14:07.488 --> 14:09.770
- Alan, alan, wait.
- What?

14:10.536 --> 14:13.141
Boing! Wubba-wubba-wubba!

14:22.717 --> 14:25.060
Is charlie here?

14:25.857 --> 14:29.440
Oh, for god's sake,
they just drop out of the sky for him.

14:30.277 --> 14:31.221
Tricia?

14:31.237 --> 14:33.581
Hi, charlie. Can I talk to you?

14:33.608 --> 14:35.423
I-I guess. What's up?

14:35.435 --> 14:38.910
I've made a horrible mistake.
I can't marry jeremy.

14:38.928 --> 14:40.143
Who's jeremy?

14:40.158 --> 14:42.093
Angie's son.

14:42.108 --> 14:46.553
I thought I wanted to settle down,
but when I saw you the other night,

14:46.578 --> 14:50.231
I realized I'm not over you.

14:50.596 --> 14:55.390
Okay, uh, you understand that I'm
involved with jeremy's mother, right?

14:55.406 --> 14:58.771
Well, I know,
but I don't understand.

15:00.245 --> 15:02.403
You're not alone.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.660
I'm so confused.

15:05.675 --> 15:07.362
I just had to see you.

15:07.377 --> 15:10.770
Oh, come on. Come on.
It'll be all right.

15:10.788 --> 15:14.350
Can I get you anything?
Something to drink?

15:14.675 --> 15:16.430
Could I have a glass of water?

15:16.447 --> 15:19.550
Sure. Here, sit down.

15:19.567 --> 15:20.930
Thank you.

15:20.947 --> 15:23.443
Alan, where do we
keep the water?

15:26.456 --> 15:28.630
Kitchen.

15:28.646 --> 15:30.461
Back in a flash.

15:30.485 --> 15:32.161
"Where do we keep the water? "

15:32.176 --> 15:35.610
I know where the scotch is. I know
where the ice cubes are. That's enough.

15:36.665 --> 15:38.113
Okay, let me get this straight.

15:38.137 --> 15:41.543
Angie's son is engaged to that woman,
who you used to be involved with,

15:41.555 --> 15:42.940
who now wants you back?

15:42.966 --> 15:46.453
Scorecards! Can't tell the
players without the scorecards.

15:48.818 --> 15:50.481
Yeah. What am I gonna do?

15:50.498 --> 15:53.690
- I know what I'd do.
- Yeah. Three pumps and an apology.

15:57.158 --> 16:00.212
What, you got another
move I ain't heard about?

16:01.436 --> 16:02.573
Okay, forget about what I'd do.

16:02.607 --> 16:04.200
That-that woman is gorgeous.

16:04.236 --> 16:06.002
How-how can you
possibly pass that up?

16:06.017 --> 16:07.812
Easy. I care about angie.

16:07.828 --> 16:09.990
Forget angie.
You don't need angie.

16:10.007 --> 16:12.652
You're just trying to sabotage my
relationship so you can have angie.

16:12.688 --> 16:15.613
What? No.

16:15.836 --> 16:19.960
No! No!

16:21.227 --> 16:22.951
Come on. Look at her.

16:22.968 --> 16:26.191
She's young, needy,
and vulnerable.

16:26.765 --> 16:28.831
Go fetch!

16:29.508 --> 16:30.840
No. No, it's not worth it.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.533
I'm not gonna screw
things up with angie.

16:32.548 --> 16:35.043
Who's gonna tell her?
I'm not gonna te hller.

16:35.107 --> 16:36.113
That's not the point.

16:36.125 --> 16:40.701
Okay, think about this.
In a few years, tricia will beahat, 29?

16:41.136 --> 16:44.411
Angie's gonna be...

16:47.075 --> 16:51.263
You're lookin' at grandkids, liver
spots, and a dusty bowl of hard candy.

16:51.595 --> 16:52.680
I don't like any of those.

16:52.715 --> 16:54.811
Of course you don'T.
Nobody does.

16:54.826 --> 16:57.600
Go ahead. Do it.

16:58.307 --> 17:00.622
Defile her!

17:10.086 --> 17:11.462
Here you are.

17:11.474 --> 17:13.222
Thanks.

17:13.646 --> 17:16.363
Listen, tricia.

17:16.376 --> 17:18.512
You know how I feel about you.

17:18.525 --> 17:20.492
We had some great
times together.

17:21.178 --> 17:23.653
Remember vegas?

17:23.675 --> 17:25.420
Oh, yeah.

17:25.758 --> 17:28.111
We didn't leave the
room for three days.

17:28.126 --> 17:29.933
Oh, yeah.

17:30.366 --> 17:34.260
Of course I couldn't leave because
I made you tie me to the bed.

17:35.697 --> 17:37.631
Oh, yeah.

17:38.086 --> 17:40.683
Do you ever hear from
the other two girls?

17:41.857 --> 17:43.642
Oh, yeah.

17:45.016 --> 17:48.962
Look, this isn't a good idea.

17:48.997 --> 17:50.850
You need to go.

17:50.868 --> 17:54.643
But can't we just
talk a little more?

17:56.785 --> 17:59.453
If we could just talk,
you wouldn't need to go.

17:59.465 --> 18:01.732
But-but charlie...

18:01.746 --> 18:03.750
Trust me.

18:03.766 --> 18:06.970
Jeremy is a great guy,
and he obviously loves you.

18:06.987 --> 18:08.442
I say give him a chance.

18:08.458 --> 18:13.423
But what if you and I had
just-just had one last fling?

18:13.757 --> 18:14.953
One last fling.

18:14.965 --> 18:16.473
Yeah. Yeah,
we'll go back to vegas.

18:16.487 --> 18:19.372
Oh, this time, I'll tie you up.

18:20.527 --> 18:23.073
You really need to go.

18:23.578 --> 18:24.842
- bye-bye. - Charlie, wait.

18:24.856 --> 18:27.203
- Bye-bye. - Wait, char...

18:29.397 --> 18:31.791
It's not too late.

18:34.967 --> 18:37.423
You can still have her.

18:37.436 --> 18:38.380
I'm not listening.

18:38.397 --> 18:40.322
You could do it in her car!
How hot is that?

18:40.336 --> 18:41.790
I can't hear you!

18:41.805 --> 18:44.150
It's dirty in a car!

18:54.458 --> 18:57.302
What the hell do you want?

18:57.985 --> 18:59.022
What?

18:59.037 --> 19:02.330
Tricia broke off her engagement
with jeremy because of you.

19:02.368 --> 19:05.511
No, no, no, no, no, no! No! No!

19:05.915 --> 19:08.220
I was good. Honest.

19:08.236 --> 19:10.310
He was crushed.

19:10.328 --> 19:14.683
My little boy had a nervous
breakdown and tried to drink bleach.

19:15.186 --> 19:16.673
Yeah, but I was good.

19:16.707 --> 19:18.061
Oh, good?

19:18.086 --> 19:20.283
Tricia told us everything
about you and her.

19:20.296 --> 19:21.740
Everything?

19:21.765 --> 19:24.210
And he was still crushed?

19:24.228 --> 19:25.751
You lied to me.

19:25.768 --> 19:28.042
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I didn't lie.

19:28.057 --> 19:30.241
I just... didn't tell.

19:30.257 --> 19:32.440
It was a long time ago.

19:32.456 --> 19:36.132
And I didn't want you to be jealous
because she's young and you're...

19:36.157 --> 19:38.503
I'm what?

19:38.516 --> 19:39.863
A real trooper?

19:39.886 --> 19:42.642
Drop dead!

19:45.765 --> 19:48.011
But I was good!

19:51.636 --> 19:54.171
******

19:54.186 --> 19:56.370
you did. You warned me.

19:56.385 --> 19:57.911
- But did you listen?
- No.

19:57.925 --> 19:59.141
- Do you ever listen?
- No.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.402
- Are you listening now?
- No.

20:02.287 --> 20:05.261
So you're just going to sit there
and feel sorry for yourself?

20:05.276 --> 20:07.730
No. I'm also gonna drink.

20:08.286 --> 20:12.390
Oh, come on, charles. This isn't
like you, apart from the drinking.

20:13.066 --> 20:14.210
What do you want me to do, mom?

20:14.246 --> 20:17.801
I want you to do what you always do:
Pick yourself up, dust yourself off,

20:17.836 --> 20:20.192
call one of your little whores.

20:20.647 --> 20:26.242
Mom, have you ever considered trying
to be nurturing and supportive?

20:26.496 --> 20:29.633
When have I ever
been anything else?

20:29.647 --> 20:32.633
Right. I don't know
what I was thinking.

20:32.646 --> 20:35.242
It's okay. I've had a lifetime
of being hurt by you.

20:35.256 --> 20:38.280
At this point,
I'm just one big scab.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.420
Where have you been?

20:42.435 --> 20:46.213
I figured since you weren't seeing angie
anymore, I'd stop by and say hello.

20:46.227 --> 20:47.410
And?

20:47.426 --> 20:49.643
She was a really mean drunk.

20:50.367 --> 20:53.633
Well, as I was trying
to tell your brother,

20:53.647 --> 20:57.110
single women that age
are notoriously unstable.

20:59.795 --> 21:03.303
What? I'm nowhere near her age.

21:03.315 --> 21:04.781
Hey, grandma, guess what?

21:04.806 --> 21:06.493
I'm gonna be in eighth
grade next year.

21:06.525 --> 21:08.351
Oh, really?

21:08.365 --> 21:10.252
Is this a move forward?

21:10.265 --> 21:12.251
- Yes.
- Yes.

21:13.056 --> 21:15.971
Then congratulations.

21:17.035 --> 21:19.571
Next stop: Clown college.

21:19.587 --> 21:22.421
There's a college for clowns?

21:23.256 --> 21:26.231
Okay. Clown junior college.
