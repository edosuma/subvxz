I spent--

01:13.406 --> 01:14.783
- Ooh, group selfie.
Don't move.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.201
I'll get my phone!

apart this summer,

quarterback.

him and said that

03:05.518 --> 03:07.478
he would never play
quarterback for the NFL--

underestimated me

03:08.605 --> 03:10.106

never play quarterback--

we get it.

03:12.025 --> 03:12.942
So, how did this happen?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.110
- I won the QB award at camp

03:14.193 --> 03:16.863
and the prize was
two tickets to meet him

03:16.946 --> 03:18.531

at the NFL Network.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.617
- Oooh, he's on TV?
Now that I get.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.370
- My mom is going to drop me off
while she goes to the outlets.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.041
My only problem is who do
I give the other ticket to?

03:28.124 --> 03:29.125

some options.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.652

03:55.735 --> 03:56.819
- Well, perhaps you should
choose the person

03:56.903 --> 04:02.533
who's dedicated the most
time and energy to the team.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.244
- That could work.
- [silently] Yes!

04:05.328 --> 04:06.120

the most dedication

04:08.456 --> 04:09.582

the best shape over summer,

04:09.666 --> 04:11.167

04:11.250 --> 04:14.671
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
You could do that.

04:14.754 --> 04:18.341
Or, uh, you could give it
to someone that you admire--

04:18.423 --> 04:20.468
say, an older mentor figure.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.886

right now?

04:41.447 --> 04:44.200
- And more importantly--why?

04:44.283 --> 04:46.077
- In summer school, Sawyer kept
himself entertained

04:46.160 --> 04:48.287
by doing the grossest
dares possible.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.207
- [mumbling -- mouth
full of food]

04:51.290 --> 04:54.252

watching him suffer.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.005
But then when he dared me,
I could not back down.

04:57.088 --> 05:01.592
- Done! Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Huh?

05:01.676 --> 05:05.763
- Oh, can you believe
he just said that?

05:05.847 --> 05:09.267
- Oh, it's on.
- Uh-huh.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.435
- Well...

05:10.518 --> 05:14.272

talking about?

09:30.611 --> 09:32.655
- Okay, look, I've been
trying to tell you this.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.282
Remember how Wentworth tried
to recruit me last season?

09:34.365 --> 09:37.034
- Yeah.
- Well... [sighing]

09:37.118 --> 09:39.829
while I was at my grandparents'
they offered me a spot again.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.497
And this time, they guaranteed
I'd be a starter.

09:41.580 --> 09:45.418
So, I accepted.
I'm going to Wentworth.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.337
- So, you're leaving
the Bulldogs?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.007
- You could put it
like that.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.513

if you're upset about this.

about a bo-go sale?

10:37.553 --> 10:42.058

have to explain.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.185
Wentworth has great teachers,

10:44.268 --> 10:45.353
and their football
program produces

10:45.436 --> 10:47.730
tons of NFL players.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.440
A total no-brainer.

because I'm on the air
in 72 seconds.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.205
But, Troy, I really think you
oughta stay with your team.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.791
- Shabooyah.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.710
- You don't think
I wanna stay?

19:29.793 --> 19:31.545
It's killing me
to leave my team,

19:31.628 --> 19:32.796
my friends, my school.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.299
It's like leaving
my home.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.216
But this is my dream.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.887
And Wentworth can get
me to the NFL.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.055
Isn't that worth
leaving for?

19:42.139 --> 19:45.726
- You know what, Troy?
I really can relate.

19:45.809 --> 19:46.894
But when it comes to football,

19:46.977 --> 19:47.936
it's all about putting
your teammates first.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.814
- Yeah, I guess maybe
you're right.

19:50.898 --> 19:54.192
- No, he's not.
- What?

19:54.276 --> 19:56.278
- Yeah. What?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.906
- If football's really about
putting your teammates first,

19:58.989 --> 20:00.115
you should be telling
me to put Troy first.

20:00.198 --> 20:03.201
Can't you see how
much this means to him?

20:03.285 --> 20:04.703
It's his dream.

20:04.786 --> 20:05.787
- But, I'm...
I'm agreeing with you.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.790
- But you were wrong.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.084
Troy, you have to
go to Wentworth.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.296
I'm sorry. I was
being selfish.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.215
And Kurt Warner really
should have noticed that.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.968
- Is there anything
else I can do for you

20:20.052 --> 20:22.471
in the next 15 seconds?

20:22.554 --> 20:25.641
- Yeah, uh, can I be on TV?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.893
- I'm not sure.
Let's ask Security.

20:32.272 --> 20:35.484
- So, does this mean you're
okay with me leaving?

20:35.567 --> 20:40.030
- No. But I will be.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.199
I just realized I'm not just
upset over losing a teammate.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.660
I'm upset because
I feel like I'm losing

20:44.743 --> 20:47.746
one of my best friends.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.664
I wish you didn't
have to leave.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.999
I'm gonna miss you.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.084
- Yeah, I'm gonna
miss you, too.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.545
Aw, come on, give me
another rib-breaker.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.173
Ohhhh!

20:58.256 --> 21:00.425
That was just
an expression.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.684
- ♪

21:08.767 --> 21:10.102
- Hey, Bella, look.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.187
Thanks for coming with me
to tell the guys.

21:12.270 --> 21:14.356
- I don't think you know what
you're walking into, Troy.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.024
You thought I was upset.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.528
The guys are gonna
be totally devastated.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.488
- That's awesome!
- Congrats, bro.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.073
- Sweet.
- Amazing.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.157
- Huh?

21:24.241 --> 21:27.035
- Well, now you're guaranteed
to go to the NFL.

21:27.119 --> 21:31.039
- You're the first of us
to touch tomorrow.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.333
- Wait. So none of you
guys are upset?

21:33.417 --> 21:35.502
- Who would be upset
about Troy living his dream?

21:35.585 --> 21:39.631
- Yeah, Bella, only a selfish
butt-knuckle would do that.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.009
- I did that.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.052
- Butt-knuckle? Say what?
- BELLA: What?
