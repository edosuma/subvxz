20:20.333 --> 20:22.625
We're done Gerry,
don't ever call me again.

20:22.667 --> 20:25.291
-Wasn't gonna call you again.
-Good race, Frank.

20:25.333 --> 20:29.000
-[Gerry quietly]: Oh shut up.
-Can't believe I lost by a hair
to the fastest man alive.

20:29.041 --> 20:32.834
-I guess that makes you the
second fastest man alive.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.834
-First of all he was like, the
fastest man alive forever ago.

20:35.875 --> 20:38.834
Second of all, you're not even
the second fastest person at
this table.

20:38.875 --> 20:42.166
'Cause I'm the fastest,
then Malik, then you.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.959
Let's go race right now, I'll
race you right now with one leg.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.083
-But I've already beaten
you on no legs.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.583
-You have legs.
-Yeah, but they don't work.

20:49.625 --> 20:51.750
-Oh right, prove it.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.834
-Am I really the second fastest
man alive?

20:54.875 --> 20:57.041
-Malik, go clean the school...

20:57.083 --> 20:59.417
With urinal pucks or something.
