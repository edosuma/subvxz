<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries <i>:</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:05.995
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look alike?

00:06.172 --> 00:08.697
Petrova doppelganger,
the key to breaking the curse.

00:08.875 --> 00:09.899
Sun and Moon curse?

00:10.143 --> 00:14.136
Vampires and werewolves used to roam
freely until a shaman put a curse on them.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.372
- Klaus is the real deal.
- First generation.

00:16.549 --> 00:19.575
The oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me?

00:21.054 --> 00:24.046
- Katerina, I have missed you.
- Klaus.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.850
Klaus is in Alaric's body.
He's possessing it.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.688
Now, while I'm gone,
you stay here, Katerina.

00:31.931 --> 00:33.899
- Elijah.
- One of the Originals. A legend.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.762
- Uhn!
- So that's it.

00:35.935 --> 00:38.165
As long as we keep
the dagger in, he stays dead?

00:38.371 --> 00:40.498
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.473
But he believed if a witch could channel
enough power, they wouldn't need one.

00:44.644 --> 00:47.044
Says if you use too much powers,
it'll kill you.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.613
Bonnie won't die for me.
I won't let that happen.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.775
- She's the only one who can do it.
- We'll find another way.

01:29.155 --> 01:30.622
Elijah.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.582
Elijah.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.556
Katerina.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.593
Excuse me.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.603
Ah. Good evening, Trevor.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.505
Pleased you could join us.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.041
I could not miss
the birthday celebration.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.509
No, considering the gift
you claim to bear.

01:55.248 --> 01:58.308
Where is this mystery girl
of which you speak?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.442
Right this way.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.449
My dear.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.530
Hello.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.728
Elijah. It's me. It's Elena.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.064
- Please.
- Shh.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.836
Oh, my God.

02:26.679 --> 02:29.842
Forgive me.
You remind me of someone.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.883
Katerina, may I introduce the Lord Elijah.

02:36.222 --> 02:41.455
- A pleasure, my lord.
- The pleasure is mine, Katerina.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.916
I can't... I can't breathe.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.387
What's happening to me?

03:11.558 --> 03:12.855
L...

03:17.330 --> 03:19.855
I can't... I can't...

03:20.033 --> 03:21.591
I can't be in this house.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.196
You're not invited in.

03:25.104 --> 03:26.628
Get me out of here.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.751
- What happened?
- Shh.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.761
I'll tell you.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.526
Not here.

03:59.105 --> 04:00.504
Can I trust you?

04:01.207 --> 04:03.573
Can I trust you?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.468
Elena?

04:38.745 --> 04:39.837
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:40.046 --> 04:43.777
- Have you seen Elena?
- Uh... No. Mm-mm.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.441
Hi, sweetie. Oh, my coffee.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.177
- Good morning. Mm.
- Mm. Good morning.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.015
- Where's Elena?
- Don't know, Stefan.

04:50.189 --> 04:52.623
She's your girlfriend.
Mine's right here.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.117
Hey, how's the shoulder?
Do I have time for a bite?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.320
I'm so hungry.

04:57.497 --> 05:00.091
It's really messy.
Can you just use a blood bag today?

05:00.266 --> 05:01.995
- I'm already late for work.
- No.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.658
Hey, it's me. Where are you?

05:03.836 --> 05:05.701
Call me.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.006
What are you doing?

05:09.175 --> 05:10.642
She's not a wind-up toy.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.836
It's really none of your business,
is it, Stefan?

05:14.013 --> 05:15.981
Yeah. What she said.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.317
- Mm.
- I have to go to work.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.146
- Oh, fine.
- Okay.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.328
No, she didn't.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.598
I'll be back as soon as I can.

05:41.774 --> 05:44.242
Yes, do hurry.
I'm anxious to get out of this body.

05:44.410 --> 05:47.743
And if you get hung up, call me.
You know how impatient I get.

05:52.885 --> 05:55.046
Where is he going?

05:57.156 --> 05:58.521
To retrieve me.

05:59.659 --> 06:01.593
So I can get out of this bad hairdo.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.854
Are you sure that's a good idea,
Klaus?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.861
Well, the full moon is almost upon us.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.024
I've killed the witch,
I have the moonstone...

06:09.202 --> 06:12.035
...and the doppelganger
is waiting in the wings.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.062
I am ready to break this curse.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.834
And why would you do that here?

06:17.009 --> 06:19.204
There are so many
that would try to stop you.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.074
Because I have to.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.613
It's the birthplace
of the doppelganger.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.411
- Didn't realize that was a requirement.
- How could you?

06:26.586 --> 06:30.647
You betrayed me and fled England before
I could give you the details, Katerina.

06:31.657 --> 06:37.493
But I did find your birthplace
and I slaughtered your family...

06:39.465 --> 06:41.592
...so I guess we're cool.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.894
Let's just hope that Elena...

06:46.672 --> 06:48.902
...isn't as stupid as you were.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.869
She won't run.

06:53.679 --> 06:57.240
She'll die before she lets anyone
that she loves get hurt.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.908
And that's exactly
what I'm counting on.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.756
You can't leave until I tell you to.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.328
You look better.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.967
Where did you get the dagger?

07:21.140 --> 07:24.541
I'll tell you everything
but we have to work together, Elijah.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.678
I need your word.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.508
Your ability to make demands
has long passed.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.507
No demands.

07:31.717 --> 07:33.947
I'm offering you my help.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.213
And in return, I want yours.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.586
And why should I even consider this?

07:38.758 --> 07:41.192
The same reason
that you haven't killed me.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.858
You need my help to kill Klaus.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.361
And I need you.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.802
<i>Where are you? Are you okay?</i>

07:52.972 --> 07:53.996
Yes, I'm fine.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.664
- Where's Elijah?
- <i>He's right here.</i>

07:56.843 --> 07:58.174
Where? I'm on my way.

07:58.344 --> 08:01.507
No, Stefan.
Elijah and I need some time alone.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.444
<i>Listen to me. He can't be trusted.</i>

08:03.616 --> 08:05.174
He'll use you to get to Klaus.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.920
Elijah is a noble man, Stefan.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.418
He lives by a code of honor.
I can trust him.

08:16.128 --> 08:19.723
He knows that I'd be incredibly stupid
to betray him again.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.732
By removing the dagger,
I have proven myself.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.497
You can't do this alone.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.831
It's my decision, Stefan.
Please respect it.

08:28.007 --> 08:31.272
And make sure that Damon
doesn't do anything stupid.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.275
I'll be in touch.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.056
- Did she just hang up on you?
- She did.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.254
She's lost it.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.025
If anyone can get him
to help us kill Klaus, it's her.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.364
Bonnie's the way. He thinks she's dead,
we've a chance with her.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.870
She'll kill herself.
Elena's looking for a way.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.407
Her way is gonna get her killed.
So we need to find her and stop her.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.442
- No, you need to back off.
- What?

09:06.612 --> 09:09.547
I don't like this any more than you,
but we need to trust her.

09:09.715 --> 09:13.617
- We gotta just let her do her thing.
- That might be your plan, mine's better.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.152
I said, back off.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.223
He's here.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.488
Klaus is here?

09:26.832 --> 09:28.493
He's taken over Alaric's body.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.360
Of course he has.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.568
One of his favorite tricks.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.909
Well, what are his other tricks?

09:37.076 --> 09:40.512
What is he gonna do next?
You're the only one who knows him.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.771
Yes, I do.

09:42.949 --> 09:46.942
So where is the mysterious host
I have heard so much about?

09:47.119 --> 09:48.416
Fashionably late.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.414
He likes to make an entrance.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.185
Here he is.

10:19.018 --> 10:23.478
Katerina, may I introduce
to you the Lord Niklaus.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.432
Niklaus is the name
my father gave me.

10:35.601 --> 10:36.795
Please...

10:38.337 --> 10:40.635
...call me Klaus.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.911
Elijah? Elena?

10:55.087 --> 10:56.918
What are you doing here?
What happened?

10:57.089 --> 11:00.320
I've had a bit of an incident, Carol.
I'm hoping you could help.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.324
Well, I'm on my way to a meeting so...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.360
I won't take but a minute of your time.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.294
Of course. Anything you need.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.264
Thank you.

11:10.436 --> 11:14.873
Well, first things first.
I'm going to need a change of clothing.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.702
Well, we could try
one of my husband's suits.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.504
I haven't boxed them up yet.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.506
Wonderful.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.880
How did you know
she's not on vervain?

11:25.051 --> 11:27.110
Because I'm the one
who got her off it.

11:27.286 --> 11:30.449
Right before you and your friends
killed me.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.022
Twice.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.285
If you excuse me,
I'll be down in a moment.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.156
- Hello?
- Hey, Stefan, it's Jenna.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.355
Jenna, hey.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.060
Where's Elena and Jeremy?
No one's answering their phones.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.569
Elena's not here at the moment.
Is everything okay?

11:47.740 --> 11:50.641
She left me weird messages
telling me to stay away from Ric.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.834
What's going on?

11:52.011 --> 11:54.571
Hard to explain over the phone
but she was hoping...

11:54.780 --> 11:57.248
...you could stay on campus
a little while longer.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.479
Well, that's kind of hard to do
from my kitchen.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.177
Wait. You're home?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.481
Yeah, what's going on?
Where's Elena?

12:04.657 --> 12:07.182
I'm to meet Ric at the Grill
for lunch to talk.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.826
Jenna, listen carefully.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.394
Whatever you do,
do not meet Alaric at the Grill.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.294
I'm gonna come over now
and I'll explain everything.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.267
I'd love to lend you a hand but you
wouldn't want me to do anything stupid.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.399
You seriously gonna be like this?

12:20.573 --> 12:24.339
You and your girlfriend are calling
the shots. I'm just backing off, Stefan.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.746
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.275
Let's go.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.943
- Where are we going?
- We're splitting from the team.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.555
- Going rogue.
- Ooh.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.122
Come on.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.923
So I assume that the Martin witches
are no longer with us?

12:44.396 --> 12:45.954
No.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.190
- I'm sorry.
- And Katerina?

12:49.368 --> 12:52.667
She would have been released
from my compulsion when I died.

12:53.539 --> 12:54.699
Klaus took her.

12:56.475 --> 12:57.669
We think she may be dead.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.811
I doubt that.

12:59.979 --> 13:05.440
Not Klaus's style. Death would be
too easy for her after what she did.

13:05.618 --> 13:09.611
I don't understand.
You say that you want Klaus dead...

13:09.789 --> 13:12.622
...but you still made Katherine pay
for betraying him.

13:13.359 --> 13:16.192
I have my own reasons
for wanting Katerina to pay.

13:16.595 --> 13:17.823
There was a time...

13:19.231 --> 13:20.960
...I'd have done anything for Klaus.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.067
From where have you come, Katerina?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.604
I am new to town, my lord.

13:25.771 --> 13:28.501
Katerina is from Bulgaria.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.505
Very good. Ha-ha.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.214
Do you mind, brother?

13:42.922 --> 13:45.220
I would like to have a moment
alone with her.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.326
No, not at all.
Happy birthday, brother.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.065
Yes.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.825
Klaus is my brother.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.660
I heard that.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.763
I'm still processing.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.931
Yes, I'm a little behind on the times...

14:03.642 --> 14:07.203
...but I believe the term
you're searching for is OMG.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.478
<i>Sometimes life</i>
<i>It takes you by the hand</i>

14:13.652 --> 14:17.816
<i>It puts you down before you know it</i>
<i>It's gone and you're dead again</i>

14:17.990 --> 14:20.857
<i>I've been in places</i>
<i>And I won't pretend</i>

14:21.026 --> 14:25.759
<i>That I make it</i>
<i>I just follow my head</i>

14:25.931 --> 14:28.456
I don't think that this is a good idea.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.762
You're an investigative journalist.
We're investigating.

14:37.743 --> 14:39.574
Hi, Alaric, you home?

14:39.745 --> 14:43.875
It's Andie Star, Jenna's friend.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.515
<i>I tie my hands up to a chair</i>
<i>So I don't fall that way</i>

14:47.686 --> 14:50.883
<i>Yeah yeah</i>
<i>And I'm alright</i>

14:53.292 --> 14:54.884
<i>But I'll hold on tight</i>

14:58.864 --> 15:01.697
- Thank God.
- Wow.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.267
You were right.
She looks exactly like Elena.

15:04.436 --> 15:05.596
Yep. Uhn.

15:06.538 --> 15:07.766
Thought you might be dead.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.935
Unfortunately not.

15:10.609 --> 15:13.772
Hey, Jenna. Thank you so much
for not going to the Grill.

15:13.946 --> 15:17.848
- Uh, Stefan...
- No, listen, I can explain.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.115
Hi, Stefan.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.984
How's it going?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.700
There's a whole family of Originals?

15:35.868 --> 15:39.326
My father was a wealthy landowner
in a village in Eastern Europe.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.871
Our mother bore seven children.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.635
So your parents were human?

15:44.810 --> 15:45.868
Our whole family was.

15:46.045 --> 15:49.310
Our origin as vampires
is a very long story, Elena.

15:49.481 --> 15:53.315
Just know,
we're the oldest vampires in the world.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.915
We are The Original Family and from us,
all vampires were created.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.991
Right, but Klaus is your brother.

16:01.327 --> 16:02.385
And you want him dead?

16:03.562 --> 16:04.688
I need some air.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.429
I'm still feeling a tad...

16:09.368 --> 16:11.529
...dead. Come.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.701
- What are you doing here?
- We are here to rescue you.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.869
No, sweetie, we are here to see
if she deserves to be rescued.

16:22.047 --> 16:23.446
Right.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.711
I figured you still might be kicking.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.046
Alari-Klaus was blending
way too easily.

16:29.221 --> 16:32.247
I figured he had probably
had some coaching.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.725
- Is that...?
- Vervain, your salvation.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.658
It's not gonna undo anything.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.731
There's always a loophole.

16:40.899 --> 16:44.335
Did he tell you to stay
until he said it was okay to leave?

16:45.404 --> 16:47.099
You can't say.

16:47.272 --> 16:51.231
Did he tell you to do absolutely
everything he says until the end of time?

16:51.410 --> 16:52.536
No.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.110
There's your loophole.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.507
Drink this and it will prevent
any further compulsion.

17:00.452 --> 17:03.114
- Give it to me.
- Answer one question first.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.051
You double-crossed us with Isobel.
Why?

17:07.226 --> 17:09.490
I didn't think you stood a chance
against Klaus.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.892
- I was looking out for myself.
- And where did that get you?

17:15.034 --> 17:18.002
Here. Be careful with that.

17:18.170 --> 17:21.138
If he finds out you have that,
you're never getting out here.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.969
You owe me.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.137
And I will collect.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.773
Come on.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.585
Nice to meet you.

17:42.027 --> 17:45.895
You know, I find chopping calming.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.129
Feel of the blade in the hand maybe.

17:52.337 --> 17:55.534
I'm still waiting for someone to tell me
what the hell's going on.

17:55.707 --> 17:58.870
Well, would you like to tell her, Stefan,
or should I?

17:59.044 --> 18:00.477
Tell me what?

18:01.914 --> 18:03.973
Do you believe in vampires, Jenna?

18:04.850 --> 18:06.943
No? Ha-ha.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.310
Well, who does, right?

18:08.487 --> 18:12.253
But, believe it or not,
they do have a place in our history.

18:12.424 --> 18:16.986
And, as a history teacher,
I find them fascinating.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.691
Why are we talking about this?

18:22.868 --> 18:27.703
You've been angry with me for keeping
secrets and this is one of my secrets.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.108
I'm obsessed with vampires.

18:33.479 --> 18:36.073
There, I said it. Ha-ha.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.717
- Are you joking?
- Not at all.

18:39.885 --> 18:42.820
How about you, Stefan?
Are you a fan of vampires?

18:44.256 --> 18:47.783
In literature. Bram Stoker?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.622
It's dense but I appreciated it.

18:51.363 --> 18:54.696
Did you know that vampires
are the oldest creatures of the night?

18:56.168 --> 18:58.466
Except for werewolves, of course.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.695
Werewolves?

19:00.506 --> 19:01.996
Werewolves.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.368
Now I know you're joking.

19:03.542 --> 19:07.842
You know, I've read that there's
an Aztec curse on both species...

19:08.013 --> 19:10.641
...that keeps werewolves slaves
to the moon...

19:11.683 --> 19:13.378
...and vampires bound by the sun.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.179
Isn't that right, Stefan?

19:16.355 --> 19:20.348
They say these creatures would do
anything to have this curse broken.

19:21.093 --> 19:25.996
And that they wouldn't care
who they had to kill to do it.

19:27.866 --> 19:31.393
So as you've seen,
nothing can kill an Original.

19:31.570 --> 19:35.631
Not sun, not fire,
not even a werewolf bite.

19:35.807 --> 19:39.800
Only the wood from one tree.
A tree my family made sure burned.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.480
That's where the white ash
for the dagger comes from.

19:42.648 --> 19:43.706
Yes.

19:43.882 --> 19:47.045
The witches won't allow anything
truly immortal to walk the Earth.

19:47.219 --> 19:50.814
Every creature needs to have a weakness
in order to maintain balance.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.888
So if the sun can't kill an Original...

19:53.058 --> 19:56.221
...why is Klaus so obsessed
with breaking the Sun and Moon curse?

19:56.395 --> 19:57.919
Right.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.894
The Curse of the Sun and the Moon.

20:01.233 --> 20:05.932
It's all so biblical sounding,
don't you think?

20:07.539 --> 20:08.597
What's so funny?

20:11.944 --> 20:13.502
Oh, look.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.943
A Roman parchment.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.385
I remember etching this scroll.

20:26.992 --> 20:29.153
I was quite blistered from drink.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.592
Your finest work remains
your Aztec drawings.

20:31.763 --> 20:35.096
Not the African carvings?
Because I was quite proud of those.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.326
The Aztec.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.035
Who can resist a shaman?

20:40.205 --> 20:43.606
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, yes.

20:44.309 --> 20:49.269
I don't understand. So Klaus drew
the Aztec sketches about the curse?

20:49.448 --> 20:52.281
Roman scrolls,
African tribal etchings...

20:52.451 --> 20:56.114
...and any other culture or continent
we felt like planting it in.

20:56.622 --> 20:57.850
But why?

20:58.023 --> 21:01.015
The easiest way to discover
the existence of a doppelganger...

21:01.193 --> 21:03.787
...or to get your hands
on some long-Iost moonstone...

21:03.962 --> 21:07.989
...is to have every single member of two
warring species on the lookout for it.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.500
So it's not Aztec at all?

21:14.740 --> 21:17.208
The Curse of the Sun and the Moon...

21:17.809 --> 21:19.276
...is fake.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.112
It doesn't exist.

21:25.183 --> 21:26.707
What?

21:28.153 --> 21:30.383
Oh, I know this all sounds so crazy.

21:30.555 --> 21:33.820
But vampires are real.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.193
Would you care for some more wine?

21:38.830 --> 21:40.889
- Get out.
- Excuse me?

21:41.066 --> 21:44.695
I don't know what you're trying to do
or why you're saying this but...

21:44.870 --> 21:47.498
- Jenna...
- I said, get out.

21:53.879 --> 21:54.971
You heard her.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.578
I'm afraid I don't want to.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.750
- Fine, I'll go.
- You're not going anywhere.

22:04.256 --> 22:06.884
- Stefan.
- Jenna, get out of here now.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.754
- You can't kill me.
- Watch me.

22:09.528 --> 22:12.088
- Stefan.
- I may not have a witch protecting me...

22:12.264 --> 22:15.563
...but if you kill this body,
what's to stop me from choosing Jenna?

22:15.967 --> 22:17.958
- Jenna, go.
- But, you...

22:18.170 --> 22:19.694
I said, go!

22:24.910 --> 22:26.036
Kill me.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.141
Remind Elena how easy
it will be for me to get revenge...

22:29.314 --> 22:32.112
...if she tries to stop me
from breaking this curse.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.362
Klaus and I faked
the Sun and Moon Curse...

22:47.566 --> 22:49.966
...dating back over a thousand years.

22:50.135 --> 22:52.695
- But if there's no curse...
- There's a curse.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.463
Just not that one.

22:54.639 --> 22:57.904
The real one's much worse.
It's a curse placed on Klaus.

22:59.277 --> 23:00.437
What are you talking about?

23:00.612 --> 23:04.708
Klaus has been trying to break it the last
thousand years and you are his hope.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.413
Well, what is this curse?

23:10.055 --> 23:13.286
Your phone will not stop
its incessant buzzing.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.119
Answer it, please.

23:17.496 --> 23:19.191
Stefan...

23:19.364 --> 23:20.991
What's wrong?

23:22.734 --> 23:24.326
No.

23:24.503 --> 23:27.563
No, no, no, l...
Okay, I'll be right there.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.503
Klaus went after Jenna.
I have to go to her.

23:32.677 --> 23:34.668
That's not part
of the day's arrangement.

23:34.846 --> 23:37.246
She's my family, Elijah. I have to.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.913
I'll be back.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.348
You have my word.

23:44.890 --> 23:48.792
That doesn't mean anything to me
until you live up to it.

23:51.663 --> 23:53.153
Thank you.

24:00.005 --> 24:01.973
- I won't.
- Well, you have to chase me.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.766
You're meant to catch me.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.208
Well, if I catch you,
the game will be over.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.578
Thank you for entertaining me.

24:12.751 --> 24:16.152
Oh, you looked Ionely inside
so I took pity on you.

24:18.657 --> 24:21.649
Klaus promised
to spend the day with me...

24:22.227 --> 24:24.787
...but he never returned home
from the night.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.693
Because Klaus does not live
by any rules but his own.

24:29.434 --> 24:31.595
He is a very charming man.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.705
Hard for any woman to resist,
I suppose.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.839
And yet?

24:38.043 --> 24:40.705
I know not why he courts me.

24:41.546 --> 24:43.639
He seems to not care about me at all.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.443
Many a union
has been built on much less.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.813
Is it wrong to want more?

24:50.989 --> 24:55.858
- Do you have more with Trevor?
- Trevor believes that he loves me.

24:56.027 --> 24:59.155
But true love is not real
unless it is returned.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.662
Do you agree?

25:02.767 --> 25:05.600
I do not believe in love, Katerina.

25:06.304 --> 25:08.738
That is too sad for me to accept,
my lord.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.672
Life is too cruel.

25:12.244 --> 25:17.375
If we cease to believe in love,
why would we want to live?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.845
- What do I interrupt?
- He's returned.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.052
Long night?

25:29.361 --> 25:30.828
What has happened?

25:30.996 --> 25:34.397
The wrong villager picked a fight
at the tavern.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.991
Oh, Jenna, thank God.

26:06.164 --> 26:07.495
No.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.059
I'm so sorry.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.563
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

26:14.773 --> 26:18.174
When I was little, your mom used
to tell me bedtime stories.

26:18.677 --> 26:21.578
Stories about vampires.

26:21.746 --> 26:24.647
I never thought
that what she said could be true.

26:25.550 --> 26:27.677
It is true, Jenna.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.412
I should have told you.

26:32.524 --> 26:35.254
I thought that if you didn't know,
you'd be safe.

26:36.194 --> 26:38.094
But then things got so out of control...

26:38.296 --> 26:41.595
...and everything I'd done to keep you
out of it blew up in my face.

26:41.766 --> 26:42.994
Who else knows?

26:46.504 --> 26:47.937
Jeremy?

26:52.310 --> 26:53.334
John?

26:54.746 --> 26:56.441
We were just trying to protect you.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.948
- Protect me?
- I'm so sorry, I will tell you everything.

27:00.118 --> 27:05.055
No, Elena, I am the one who is supposed
to be protecting you and Jeremy.

27:05.223 --> 27:07.714
I know. But there's nothing
that you could have done.

27:07.892 --> 27:10.292
- There's so much more to it...
- No, this is like...

27:10.462 --> 27:13.022
This is so... I don't know how l...

27:13.198 --> 27:14.256
Hey, I know. Hey.

27:14.432 --> 27:15.899
Why didn't you tell me?

27:21.206 --> 27:23.868
- I'm scared.
- I know.

27:26.111 --> 27:27.908
Oh, I know. I know, hey.

27:29.547 --> 27:31.208
Hey.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.782
I'm sorry.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.952
Jenna, I'm so, so sorry.

27:59.811 --> 28:01.278
Is she gonna be okay?

28:01.446 --> 28:03.107
She's in shock.

28:03.281 --> 28:07.945
I tried to tell her as much as I could
but I barely scratched the surface.

28:08.119 --> 28:10.349
I'm so sorry, Elena.

28:10.855 --> 28:11.947
I hate this.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.590
It's not your fault, Stefan.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.887
It's mine.

28:18.997 --> 28:24.799
Anyway, I have to go back to Elijah.

28:25.303 --> 28:27.032
Wait, what? No, no.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.197
Stefan, I promised him
that I would return.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.138
I can't break that promise.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.044
I'll be okay.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.785
- Where do you think you're going?
- Back to Elijah.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.584
- No.
- Get out of my way, Da...

28:49.761 --> 28:53.322
If you so much as try
and take a step out of this house...

28:53.498 --> 28:55.261
- Easy.
- Stay out of this, Andie.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.924
- Let her go.
- Are you kidding? We just got her back.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.762
You heard me.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.230
I said, let her go.

29:04.943 --> 29:07.411
That's twice today
you've stood in my way.

29:08.713 --> 29:10.647
I wouldn't try a third.

29:12.784 --> 29:16.652
<i>Like a shotgun</i>
<i>Needs an outcome</i>

29:16.821 --> 29:18.584
<i>You gon' get some</i>

29:18.757 --> 29:23.922
<i>Go ahead, go way low</i>
<i>Where I can do no harm</i>

29:24.095 --> 29:28.623
<i>Go ahead, go way low</i>
<i>In my honey lovin' arms</i>

29:28.800 --> 29:32.167
<i>Go ahead, go way low</i>
<i>Where I can do no wrong</i>

29:33.872 --> 29:38.605
<i>Got you around my finger</i>
<i>Like a Ionely lover's charm</i>

29:39.344 --> 29:42.279
<i>Go ahead, go</i>
<i>Go ahead, go</i>

29:42.447 --> 29:43.675
You mind turning that down?

29:43.848 --> 29:47.682
<i>Go ahead, go</i>
<i>Go ahead, go</i>

29:47.852 --> 29:48.910
Why so grumpy?

29:49.087 --> 29:52.113
Well, this body has outlived
its usefulness.

29:52.657 --> 29:53.954
Do you want a drink?

29:54.125 --> 29:56.685
- No, Katerina, I don't want a drink.
- Come on.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.385
It might loosen you up.

30:00.999 --> 30:06.437
What I want is for you to sit down
and shut up.

30:16.114 --> 30:17.877
Maddox, what took you so long?

30:18.049 --> 30:20.176
You got a lot of luggage.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.327
Greta. Finally.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.089
- Hello, love.
- Hello.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.697
Nice body.

30:36.668 --> 30:40.160
- You ready to get out of it?
- Mm-hm.

31:05.597 --> 31:06.894
Welcome back.

31:08.566 --> 31:10.431
Tell me.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.229
What is Klaus's curse?

31:16.608 --> 31:18.075
Please.

31:24.315 --> 31:27.011
You know, my family was quite close.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.449
But Klaus and my father
did not get on too well.

31:29.621 --> 31:32.522
When we became vampires,
we discovered the truth.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.920
Klaus was not my father's son.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.026
My mother had been unfaithful
many years before.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.222
This was her darkest secret.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.167
Klaus was from a different bloodline.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.735
Of course,
when my father discovered this...

31:46.905 --> 31:53.777
...he hunted down and he killed
my mother's lover and his entire family.

31:53.945 --> 31:57.540
Not realizing, of course, that he
was igniting a war between species...

31:57.715 --> 31:59.876
...that rages until this day.

32:00.051 --> 32:01.348
A war between the species?

32:01.519 --> 32:03.612
The vampires...

32:04.989 --> 32:06.183
...and the werewolves.

32:08.593 --> 32:12.586
So Klaus's real father
was from a werewolf bloodline?

32:14.966 --> 32:17.628
What does that make Klaus?

32:17.969 --> 32:22.269
A werewolf or a vampire?

32:24.142 --> 32:25.939
He's both.

32:33.284 --> 32:36.447
A hybrid would be deadlier
than any werewolf or vampire.

32:37.355 --> 32:39.949
Nature would not stand
for such an imbalance of power.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.991
Therefore the witches,
the servants of nature, saw to it...

32:43.161 --> 32:46.187
...that my brother's werewolf side
would become dormant.

32:47.498 --> 32:49.466
That's the curse
Klaus wants to break?

32:49.634 --> 32:52.125
He wants to trigger that part of him
that's werewolf.

32:52.303 --> 32:55.295
If allowed, Klaus would sire
his own bloodline.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.065
He'd build his own race...

32:57.542 --> 33:01.569
...endangering not just vampires
but everyone.

33:01.779 --> 33:04.907
- But you helped him.
- I helped him because I loved him.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.177
That's changed now. He must die.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.014
We have the dagger.
We can stop him.

33:10.188 --> 33:13.248
When a werewolf is wounded by silver,
it heals.

33:13.424 --> 33:17.087
An Original can't be killed by anything
but white oak ash on silver dagger.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.661
See the conundrum?
The dagger does not work.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.231
What are you saying?
Klaus can't be killed?

33:22.400 --> 33:25.528
There's one way
to kill any supernatural species.

33:25.703 --> 33:28.797
At the hands of the servants
of nature themselves.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.868
A witch.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.333
If they can channel that much power.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.108
But it would kill them.

33:38.316 --> 33:40.876
The curse must be broken
during the full moon...

33:41.052 --> 33:45.284
...when Klaus is in transition. That's
when he'll be at his most vulnerable.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.720
A witch with enough power...

33:48.126 --> 33:50.959
...can kill Klaus.

33:52.764 --> 33:57.861
What if I told you that I knew a witch
that could channel that much power?

33:58.036 --> 34:01.301
Then I would tell you there's
one more thing that you should know.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.733
The full moon is tomorrow, brother.

34:06.911 --> 34:10.312
After all these centuries, it is finally time.

34:11.748 --> 34:14.445
I have been to see the witches.

34:14.619 --> 34:18.077
They believe they may have found a way
to spare the doppelganger.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.724
What does it matter if she lives or not?

34:21.225 --> 34:23.125
She is a means to an end. That is all.

34:23.293 --> 34:25.284
But she should die for your gain?

34:26.097 --> 34:27.792
She is human.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.489
Her life means nothing.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.726
I beg you to consider this.

34:35.306 --> 34:39.766
Are you so foolish as to care for her?

34:40.244 --> 34:42.007
Of course not.

34:42.513 --> 34:46.074
Love is a vampire's greatest weakness.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.981
And we are not weak, Elijah.

34:50.154 --> 34:53.817
We do not feel and we do not care.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.087
We did once.

35:01.199 --> 35:03.429
Too many lifetimes ago to matter.

35:03.968 --> 35:06.459
Tell the witches not to bother.

35:06.637 --> 35:08.468
The sacrifice will happen as planned.

35:11.309 --> 35:14.642
You found a way
to save the life of the doppelganger?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.013
Yes, Elena.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.044
I did.

35:20.218 --> 35:26.555
Unfortunately, Katerina took matters
into her own hands first.

35:28.359 --> 35:30.919
I believe you already know
how that played out.

35:31.929 --> 35:34.124
You cared about her, didn't you?

35:34.298 --> 35:36.357
It's a common mistake, I'm told.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.961
It's one I won't make again.

35:44.742 --> 35:47.040
You don't have to be so mad
at your brother.

35:47.211 --> 35:49.679
You know, he's just worried
about Elena and...

35:49.847 --> 35:51.405
Just go. Please.

35:51.582 --> 35:53.914
- I know you're worried about her too.
- Andie.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.180
Go.

35:56.354 --> 35:57.480
Okay.

36:02.226 --> 36:05.389
- Tired of your plaything already?
- Don't start with me, Stefan.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.030
She's just my distraction.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.990
She's a person. You're victimizing her.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.830
You should be thankful she's here.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.734
She keeps me from going
for what I really want.

36:18.776 --> 36:20.403
You're right.

36:20.578 --> 36:24.514
Thank you for being in love
with my girlfriend.

36:27.552 --> 36:30.214
And there it is.

36:32.723 --> 36:34.190
There it is.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.051
You know, you can be in love
with Elena all you want.

36:40.064 --> 36:42.396
If it means that you'll protect her.

36:43.434 --> 36:45.766
But I have the one thing
that you never will.

36:45.937 --> 36:49.134
Oh, yeah? What's that?

36:51.776 --> 36:52.902
Her respect.

37:01.619 --> 37:03.280
Stop.

37:10.628 --> 37:11.959
What have you done?

37:13.264 --> 37:14.288
I don't understand.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.626
Katerina is gone. She has fled.

37:18.169 --> 37:19.602
No.

37:19.770 --> 37:21.499
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

37:22.773 --> 37:24.638
Do not lie to me!

37:24.809 --> 37:27.573
I will find her.

37:27.945 --> 37:29.412
You have my word.

37:30.047 --> 37:32.072
If you do not...

37:32.250 --> 37:34.241
...I give you my word.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.942
You will be dead.

37:38.322 --> 37:39.653
Now you've invited him in?

37:39.824 --> 37:41.917
Elijah and I renewed
the terms of our deal.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.526
Really?

37:43.694 --> 37:46.561
The two of you will come to no harm
at my hands.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.458
I only ask for one thing in return.

37:51.636 --> 37:54.867
- What?
- An apology.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.669
A what?

38:07.585 --> 38:11.487
I'm sorry for the part
that I played in your death.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.553
I was protecting Elena.

38:15.893 --> 38:19.454
I will always protect Elena.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.728
I understand.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.705
The sacrifice is going to happen,
Damon.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.071
Bonnie will kill Klaus
without hurting herself...

38:36.247 --> 38:38.545
...and Elijah knows
how to save my life.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.513
I told you I'd find another way.

38:40.685 --> 38:41.709
And I did.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.187
- Is that true?
- It is.

38:44.355 --> 38:47.085
- And you're trusting him?
- I am.

38:48.192 --> 38:50.422
You can all go to hell.

39:00.404 --> 39:03.373
He's angry with me right now.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.372
But he'll come around.

39:07.545 --> 39:09.410
Perhaps.

39:16.921 --> 39:18.752
I thought I told you to leave.

39:18.923 --> 39:21.448
You didn't compel me.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.222
I want to be here.

39:25.396 --> 39:27.728
Just let me be here.

39:31.869 --> 39:36.238
I'm upset.
You know happens when I'm upset.

39:36.974 --> 39:38.271
You have to leave.

39:39.443 --> 39:41.411
No.

39:41.579 --> 39:44.070
You need to know
that somebody cares about you.

39:44.248 --> 39:45.738
I care about you, Damon.

40:01.699 --> 40:03.496
You...

40:04.568 --> 40:06.126
Andie.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.097
Look at me.

40:13.511 --> 40:17.311
Get out of here before I kill you.

40:18.015 --> 40:19.812
Just go.

40:20.818 --> 40:22.410
Go.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.445
Now!

41:12.203 --> 41:13.761
Elena?

41:38.095 --> 41:40.359
Now that's more like it.
