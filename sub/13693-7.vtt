WEBVTT

00:07.468 --> 00:09.095
Norton Commando.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.936
Thought so.

00:18.646 --> 00:22.191
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
Archie. Take a seat.

00:22.275 --> 00:24.944
-Coffee?
-Er, no thanks.

00:26.112 --> 00:27.947
Just tell me, how bad is it?

00:28.031 --> 00:31.367
Now, the deadline for
the death duties is up.

00:31.451 --> 00:33.286
You've got two days to pay

00:33.369 --> 00:36.873
or you'll start to accrue
a significant
amount of interest.

00:36.956 --> 00:40.710
And, er, that's on
top of the original sum.

00:42.337 --> 00:46.716
I had a client in a similar
position not so long ago.

00:46.799 --> 00:50.636
-And what happened?
-Bankrupt within a month.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.932
Now, the bank have made
their position very clear.

00:55.016 --> 00:58.394
They'll offer no more help
until this debt
has been satisfied.

00:58.478 --> 01:02.440
So your only chance is to
raise the money yourself.

01:02.523 --> 01:04.525
Well, I don't see how.

01:04.608 --> 01:07.320
The wolf park is making
a profit, but it's nowhere
near what we need.

01:07.403 --> 01:10.698
-There must be other ways.
-I've tried them all.

01:10.782 --> 01:13.618
The ones I can
think of anyway.

01:13.701 --> 01:15.661
Surely there must be
something you can do.

01:15.745 --> 01:20.875
Sorry, Archie,
I'm a solicitor,
not a miracle worker.

02:08.089 --> 02:10.091
Thank you for coming,
Kilwillie.

02:10.174 --> 02:12.677
Well, actually, I was rather
looking for an excuse.

02:12.759 --> 02:15.013
You've never
needed one before.

02:15.096 --> 02:17.640
I wasn't sure what
sort of reception
I'd get from your mother.

02:17.724 --> 02:20.643
Yes, after your
declaration of devotion.

02:20.727 --> 02:24.104
Well, I did think I was about
to enter the celestial
city at the time.

02:24.188 --> 02:25.815
You were drugged,
she knows that.

02:25.898 --> 02:28.359
-She didn't take
me seriously, then?
-No, of course not.

02:28.443 --> 02:31.696
Oh, well, that's a relief.

02:31.779 --> 02:32.947
(KILWILLIE CHUCKLING)

02:33.031 --> 02:36.868
So, what is it you
wanted to see me about?

02:36.951 --> 02:41.914
If you needed to lay your
hands on a substantial sum of
money very, very quickly,

02:41.998 --> 02:44.208
how would you go about it?

02:44.292 --> 02:47.128
Strictly entre nous,

02:47.211 --> 02:49.213
Inverness to Heathrow,
Heathrow to Zurich,

02:49.297 --> 02:51.174
taxi to the
National Bank of Switzerland,

02:51.257 --> 02:54.719
and back with my feet
up at Kilwillie Castle
inside 16 hours.

02:54.802 --> 02:57.388
And if that wasn't an option?

02:57.471 --> 03:00.475
-Well, stocks and bonds.
-Nor that.

03:00.558 --> 03:02.894
Oh.

03:02.977 --> 03:07.190
Well, I suppose, at a pinch,
I could do without the XJ6
or one of the Bentleys,

03:07.273 --> 03:09.776
but it seems a pity to
split the collection.

03:09.859 --> 03:13.654
You're not feeling
the fiscal squeeze, are you?

03:13.738 --> 03:17.867
-Yes.
-The solution's obvious,
I'd say.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.660
Not to me it isn't.

03:19.744 --> 03:22.205
I'll always give you a
fair price for land, Archie,

03:22.288 --> 03:23.831
as long as
it's the right piece.

03:23.915 --> 03:28.294
-Absolutely not.
-Oh, well,
it's up to you, old boy.

03:44.477 --> 03:49.232
Excuse me.
I think we need to
have some words, laddie.

03:49.315 --> 03:53.653
-It's a long time since
anyone called me that.
-Yeah, it must be.

03:53.736 --> 03:56.531
So I'd say you were old
enough to know better.

03:56.614 --> 03:59.033
-Not with you.
-You nearly had me
over in the village.

03:59.117 --> 04:01.703
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-And now you're on
a private estate.

04:01.786 --> 04:03.705
-I had no idea.
-Evidently.

04:03.788 --> 04:07.375
Is there a telephone nearby?
She's just not turning over.

04:07.458 --> 04:10.795
Down that way, about 10 miles.

04:13.423 --> 04:15.216
Nice bike by the way.

04:23.725 --> 04:27.228
-Kilwillie?
-Oh, Molly.

04:27.311 --> 04:30.481
As a matter of fact,
I've been meaning
to come and see you.

04:30.565 --> 04:31.983
-Really?
-Yes.

04:32.066 --> 04:34.986
I want to clear up
any misunderstanding.

04:35.069 --> 04:39.365
-And what misunderstanding
might that be?
-Well, I've...

04:39.449 --> 04:41.743
-I've said
a few things that...
-You didn't mean?

04:41.825 --> 04:45.747
-No.
-So you did mean them?

04:45.830 --> 04:51.169
When a chap thinks his
number's up, he can become
rather emotional.

04:51.252 --> 04:54.839
And if that chap
harbours certain feelings,

04:54.922 --> 04:59.052
well, he might be inclined to
articulate them, a bit more
than he would otherwise,

05:00.136 --> 05:02.472
if circumstances
were different.

05:03.722 --> 05:05.516
Oh, please say
you're not cross.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.310
You were
Hector's best friend.

05:07.393 --> 05:08.935
And proud of it.

05:09.020 --> 05:11.522
I thought you would have
more respect for his memory.

05:11.606 --> 05:16.986
Oh, Molly, a moment's
indiscretion. Can't we just
put it behind us?

05:17.070 --> 05:20.573
-Forgive and forget?
-In time, probably.

05:20.656 --> 05:23.993
But I can't pretend that
I'm not very disappointed.

05:41.302 --> 05:43.179
ARCHIE: Nothing we could sell
would be worth anything.

05:43.262 --> 05:46.015
We don't want to sell any
of the river or the loch

05:46.099 --> 05:48.351
and obviously Ben
Bogle has to be protected.

05:48.434 --> 05:51.187
This is grouse moor,
this is where we
stalk the deer.

05:51.270 --> 05:53.898
Exactly, so they're out.

05:53.981 --> 05:57.068
Then I'd say it
has to be here.

05:57.151 --> 05:59.195
That's Doon Brae,
no, we can't.

05:59.278 --> 06:02.407
Whichever bit we let go,
it's not going
to hurt any less.

06:02.490 --> 06:05.368
We'd lose a huge
stretch of water
and all access from the south.

06:05.451 --> 06:06.619
It would make
things impossible.

06:06.703 --> 06:08.162
But it joins onto
Kilwillie's land,

06:08.246 --> 06:10.790
which means
he'll pay good money.

06:10.873 --> 06:15.211
Archie, sometimes we
have to cull the herd
to ensure its survival.

06:18.923 --> 06:21.092
(SIGHING) Maybe you're right.

06:24.804 --> 06:27.515
It'll be a hell of
a wrench letting that go.

06:27.598 --> 06:32.270
I think it's my favourite
spot on the whole estate,
ever since I was a boy.

06:34.105 --> 06:36.190
There's not a view like it.

06:50.455 --> 06:52.498
Duncan, what are you doing?

06:52.582 --> 06:54.208
Just thought I'd finish
this off for you.

06:54.292 --> 06:57.754
Well, you've done
that all right.

06:57.837 --> 07:01.591
And how am I
supposed to use this?

07:01.674 --> 07:03.676
-I was just trying to help.
-Well, you're not.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.511
And leaving a stone
in your shirt

07:05.595 --> 07:07.680
wasn't the smartest thing
you could have done either.

07:07.764 --> 07:11.975
Well, you shouldn't be
keeping secrets from me.
I know what the matter is.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.354
-How?
-Archie told me.

07:14.437 --> 07:16.939
Archie? What did he say?

07:17.023 --> 07:20.234
That the estate's in trouble.
That's why you've been
in a bad mood, isn't it?

07:20.318 --> 07:22.862
-No.
-Well,
you admit you are, then.

07:27.575 --> 07:30.453
Relationships are all
about communication.

07:30.536 --> 07:34.582
We must listen to each other
very... What did you
say about a stone?

07:34.665 --> 07:38.252
In your washing. Do you know
what kind of damage that could
have done to the machine?

07:38.336 --> 07:41.631
-Where is it now?
-I threw it
outside in the yard.

08:01.567 --> 08:06.280
Oh, no, please, no.

08:06.364 --> 08:10.201
It's for the driveway,
they've just delivered it.

08:10.284 --> 08:12.620
-Splendid news.
-Is it?

08:12.704 --> 08:16.541
Absolutely. You want
to sell, I want to buy.
Do us both a bit of good.

08:16.623 --> 08:21.045
Hold on, there are
other interested parties.

08:21.129 --> 08:23.756
And you would put them
before your
father's greatest chum?

08:23.840 --> 08:26.801
Well,
I'm afraid all I care about
is getting the best price.

08:26.884 --> 08:28.928
I see.

08:29.012 --> 08:31.347
Well, that isn't how Hector
would have managed things.

08:31.431 --> 08:34.100
And I think that's
a valuable lesson to us all.

08:34.183 --> 08:35.893
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

08:37.602 --> 08:39.813
Archie, have you got a minute?

08:39.897 --> 08:42.607
-Um, not now, no.
-It's important.

08:44.444 --> 08:46.029
It had better be. I'm sorry.

08:46.112 --> 08:49.198
Oh, it's not a problem.
Take as long as you like.

08:57.164 --> 09:01.502
-Do you think he'll go for it?
-Yeah, he's bound to.
He won't be able to resist.

09:07.425 --> 09:09.594
Probably best not to ask.

09:25.651 --> 09:30.114
Oh, I think the Kilwillie
coffers can run to
a better offer than those.

09:35.453 --> 09:37.205
-Well?
-No.

09:37.288 --> 09:38.581
Told you.

09:50.426 --> 09:53.012
-I don't believe it.
-It's not?

09:54.347 --> 09:55.682
It is.

09:57.809 --> 10:02.230
My lucky wish stone. I've
had it since I was a boy.

10:02.313 --> 10:06.067
How does that work, then?
Do you rub it over
your lottery tickets?

10:06.150 --> 10:07.568
No, it was a christening
present,

10:07.652 --> 10:10.822
a friend of my
granny's, an old woman
with a power.

10:10.905 --> 10:14.242
I tell it my wish,
and then I turn round twice,

10:14.325 --> 10:18.287
and then I throw the stone
in the loch and then
that wish comes true.

10:18.371 --> 10:21.249
-So why have
you never done it?
-You only get one go.

10:21.332 --> 10:23.918
But there must have
been things you've wanted.

10:24.002 --> 10:27.755
So I'm saving this beauty
for something really special.

10:30.508 --> 10:32.760
If only life was that simple.

10:37.765 --> 10:40.309
Well done, Archie,
I knew you'd see sense.

10:40.393 --> 10:44.439
I'll get onto McGregor, have
him call in a surveyor, get
the exact boundaries drawn up.

10:44.522 --> 10:49.235
While I arrange the readies.
Well, home for
a celebratory snifter I think.

10:53.156 --> 10:56.993
Actually,
I think I might hang on
for a minute or two.

10:57.076 --> 10:59.370
Looks as if we might be
due for a spot of rain.

11:05.084 --> 11:10.840
-What's on your mind?
-It's Irene,
I think she's going off me.

11:10.923 --> 11:16.429
-What makes you say that?
-Well,
it's just she's acting weird.

11:16.512 --> 11:20.975
Oh, perhaps she thinks that
you're starting to
take her for granted.

11:21.059 --> 11:23.269
But I've not, though.

11:23.353 --> 11:28.566
I mean, just last week I
bought her chocolates, and
not the ones on special offer.

11:30.401 --> 11:32.820
And who said romance was dead?

11:35.156 --> 11:37.825
-Where is she anyway?
-Away in a huff.

11:41.954 --> 11:45.750
I don't suppose you could have
a wee talk with her?

11:45.833 --> 11:47.377
Anything else?

11:50.171 --> 11:54.175
Well, if there's any
more tea in the pot,
that would be nice.

12:02.058 --> 12:03.601
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

12:19.409 --> 12:21.244
What are you doing
knocking at my door?

12:21.327 --> 12:23.329
Do you think I'd have knocked
if I knew you were inside?

12:23.413 --> 12:25.998
-So why did you?
-Because I've been
pushing this for miles.

12:26.082 --> 12:27.583
It's the first place
I've seen,
there's a motorbike,

12:27.667 --> 12:29.502
I thought somebody might help.
Never mind.

12:29.585 --> 12:31.087
Wait a minute.

12:33.589 --> 12:36.259
I won't hurt to
have a look, I suppose.

12:49.439 --> 12:52.400
-Do you want to talk about it?
-What?

12:52.483 --> 12:55.737
-Whatever it is
that's on your mind.
-Not really.

12:58.406 --> 13:00.575
-Is it Duncan?
-Partly.

13:05.163 --> 13:08.666
If you don't want to go
out with him, just tell him.

13:10.668 --> 13:14.297
He won't be happy,
but he will get over it.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.632
That's just it,
I'm not sure what I want.

13:16.716 --> 13:20.595
Then explain that to him,
he'll understand.

13:20.678 --> 13:22.096
I doubt it.

13:26.392 --> 13:28.144
I'm pregnant, Lexie.

13:30.438 --> 13:32.857
-You're what?
-Expecting a baby.

13:32.940 --> 13:36.569
Yeah, I know what it means.

13:36.652 --> 13:41.866
-It's just a bit of a shock,
that's all.
-You can say that again.

13:41.949 --> 13:46.704
-But Duncan'll be pleased.
-He won't, believe me.

13:46.788 --> 13:49.624
Most men say they
don't want kids,
then when it happens...

13:49.707 --> 13:53.044
It's not his, it can't be.

13:53.127 --> 13:54.754
Then whose?

13:54.837 --> 13:58.007
I was with someone
before I came here.

13:58.091 --> 13:59.384
I see.

14:05.848 --> 14:07.642
Don't. Come here.

14:11.187 --> 14:15.233
Please don't say
anything to anyone, will you?

14:15.316 --> 14:21.114
Not if you don't want me to.
But you have to tell Duncan,
sooner rather than later.

14:28.538 --> 14:31.082
Do you know any
Rosses living locally?

14:31.165 --> 14:33.710
Not that I can think of. Why?

14:33.793 --> 14:37.380
That's my
mother's maiden name.
She came from this area.

14:37.463 --> 14:42.885
That's why I'm up here,
I'm trying to track down
some long-lost relatives.

14:42.969 --> 14:47.557
-You could try the phone book.
-I have. And the library
and the electoral roll.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.852
And I've ridden through
every village on the map.

14:50.935 --> 14:52.520
-No luck?
-No.

14:54.313 --> 14:56.858
Okay. Give it a whirl.

15:02.864 --> 15:04.741
(ENGINE REVVING)

15:07.076 --> 15:10.371
Sweet as a nut.
You've done this before?

15:10.455 --> 15:13.833
I've had plenty of practice.

15:13.916 --> 15:17.003
Well, they say they can
be a bit temperamental.

15:17.086 --> 15:18.463
Cup of tea?

15:21.591 --> 15:22.842
Thanks.

15:30.308 --> 15:31.559
MOLLY: Archie!

15:35.355 --> 15:37.065
Archie, they're here.

15:40.985 --> 15:42.779
He'd have understood.

15:47.909 --> 15:51.871
No, I've let him down.
I've let you all down.

15:51.954 --> 15:55.458
You had no choice.
Let's get this over with.

15:57.085 --> 16:00.046
-Archie.
-You didn't waste
much time, did you?

16:00.129 --> 16:05.343
We can't afford to drag our
heels on this one. This is the
surveyor, Greg MacDonald.

16:07.095 --> 16:10.807
What's the matter, lad?
Would you rather
have had a Campbell?

16:10.890 --> 16:13.309
No, I'm just surprised
we've never met before.

16:13.393 --> 16:15.603
Ach, well, we live over
the other side of Inverness,

16:15.687 --> 16:18.439
and we keep
ourselves to ourselves,
don't we, Morag?

16:18.523 --> 16:19.649
Oh, aye.

16:19.732 --> 16:21.818
-My wife.
-Hello.

16:21.901 --> 16:26.280
I thought she ought to be
here, today of all days.

16:26.364 --> 16:28.116
Sorry?

16:28.199 --> 16:31.703
Our first chance to see inside
the great
ancestral home of the clan.

16:31.786 --> 16:38.251
Tell me, is that
not William MacDonald,
the great duellist?

16:40.670 --> 16:42.630
I think so.

16:42.714 --> 16:46.342
-Oh, definitely, I'd say...
-We really ought
to make a start.

16:46.426 --> 16:49.137
Oh, yes, of course. But
I really think

16:49.220 --> 16:51.514
you ought to hear what
I have to say first.

16:58.688 --> 17:00.356
Duncan.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.567
-I know what you're gonna say.
-I doubt that.

17:02.650 --> 17:07.070
You don't think I'm
serious about you.
Well, I've had an idea.

17:07.155 --> 17:10.867
-I'd like you to
meet my Auntie Liz.
-What?

17:10.950 --> 17:14.078
You'll really like her.
The thing is...

17:16.204 --> 17:19.416
trying to catch her at home.
She gets out and
about all over.

17:19.500 --> 17:23.671
Monday night, bingo.
Every second Tuesday,
folk club.

17:23.755 --> 17:26.214
Wednesdays, self-defence.

17:26.299 --> 17:30.386
-She sounds like a busy lady.
-She is, but she can
fit us in this evening.

17:30.470 --> 17:31.929
How's that
for a stroke of luck?

17:32.013 --> 17:34.515
I'm really not sure
that I ought to come.

17:34.599 --> 17:37.769
-Duncan...
-Please,
it would mean a lot to me.

17:40.021 --> 17:42.690
-Okay.
-Great.

17:46.277 --> 17:48.236
I'll give her a call.

17:50.072 --> 17:53.284
Before she puts her
name down for the dominoes.

17:58.331 --> 18:01.792
Bear with me,
it's in here somewhere.

18:01.876 --> 18:06.422
-I'll just drop
that in the bin.
-No, you will not.

18:06.506 --> 18:10.133
I'd have nothing for
my supper. Here it is.

18:13.262 --> 18:16.307
The 1715 land treaty.

18:16.391 --> 18:18.685
The what?

18:18.768 --> 18:23.147
You've not heard of it.
It was drawn up amongst
the MacDonald chieftains

18:23.231 --> 18:28.277
to ensure all ancestral land
stayed within our hands.

18:28.361 --> 18:32.532
Sounds fascinating, but this
isn't really a good moment for
a history lesson.

18:32.615 --> 18:35.993
Well, I'm just coming
to the interesting part.

18:36.077 --> 18:41.124
"If the laird ever has
the need to sell off acreage,
then any other MacDonald,"

18:42.041 --> 18:43.876
such as myself,

18:43.960 --> 18:47.964
"could invoke the right
to buy the entire estate."

18:49.799 --> 18:52.051
Which means what?

18:52.135 --> 18:54.429
You have to sell us Glenbogle.

18:55.763 --> 18:57.140
(SCOFFING)

18:57.223 --> 18:58.933
This is some
sort of a hoax, right?

18:59.017 --> 19:01.602
I've researched
every last detail.

19:01.686 --> 19:03.730
But who'd take
something like that
seriously these days?

19:03.813 --> 19:04.981
I do.

19:06.649 --> 19:09.694
Have you any idea
what an estate
like this would cost?

19:09.777 --> 19:16.325
I have a rather large
inheritance. My family were
very big in offal products.

19:16.409 --> 19:19.120
-But we're
talking serious money.
-Aye.

19:20.955 --> 19:24.751
-You're not a surveyor, then?
-Oh, I still work.

19:24.834 --> 19:29.213
Idle hands are
the devil's plaything.

19:29.297 --> 19:33.593
And I dare say I'll find
plenty to keep us busy once
we're settled in here.

19:33.676 --> 19:36.471
Right, that's it, I've
heard enough. Go on, get out.

19:36.554 --> 19:41.601
Well, if that's what you want.
But you'll be seeing
us again soon enough.

19:41.684 --> 19:44.979
-I wouldn't bet on it.
-I'll show you out.

19:47.774 --> 19:50.777
Your copy. Come along, Morag.

20:02.163 --> 20:04.332
Another?

20:04.415 --> 20:07.794
-Love to,
but I'd better order a taxi.
-Taxi?

20:07.877 --> 20:10.129
More chance of flying.

20:10.213 --> 20:14.467
Listen, there's a settee
in there, it's not much but
you're welcome to it.

20:14.550 --> 20:17.553
-Sure?
-I wouldn't offer if I wasn't.

20:17.637 --> 20:20.723
Well, beats sitting
in a room by yourself.

20:24.644 --> 20:27.689
You know where the best malt
I ever tasted came from?

20:27.772 --> 20:30.149
-The Highlands, surely.
-No.

20:30.233 --> 20:32.485
-The Orkneys, Isla?
-Japan.

20:32.568 --> 20:34.570
Get away.

20:34.654 --> 20:38.533
-Mind you, I hadn't had
a drink in six months.
-That would account for it.

20:40.284 --> 20:44.580
So, what line are you in?

20:44.664 --> 20:50.169
Anything and everything. I've
made and lost a great deal of
money in my time.

20:50.253 --> 20:54.924
Managed to hold onto a chunk
this time round, though,
and then hit the road.

20:56.801 --> 21:00.304
What, you just hit the road?

21:00.388 --> 21:04.225
Yes. I've been around,
seen a lot of places.

21:04.308 --> 21:07.437
Funny thing is,
I've never been here before.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.815
So, where do you call home?

21:10.898 --> 21:14.152
Right now,
it's the back of the bike.

21:14.235 --> 21:16.612
And when your journey's over?

21:18.322 --> 21:20.074
Wherever it takes me.

21:27.540 --> 21:30.376
You have a visitor, my Lord.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.587
Probably not
a very welcome one.

21:32.670 --> 21:35.548
I came to apologise
for what I said this morning.

21:35.631 --> 21:38.509
It's already forgotten.
Would you like
a glass of sherry?

21:38.593 --> 21:41.012
Yes,
thank you, just a small one.

21:41.095 --> 21:45.308
I didn't want us to fall out,
not with everything
else that's happening.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.227
About the estate, you mean?
Didn't Archie tell you?

21:48.311 --> 21:51.105
We've struck a deal,
your worries are over.

21:51.189 --> 21:54.275
No, Kilwillie, they
might have only just begun.

21:56.694 --> 21:59.822
-It's lovely to
meet you, Maureen.
-Irene.

21:59.906 --> 22:02.867
Not often he brings
a lassie back for tea,
is it, Duncan?

22:02.950 --> 22:04.952
No, Auntie.

22:05.036 --> 22:08.498
What was the name of that
last one? Skinny wee thing,
covered in freckles.

22:08.581 --> 22:11.084
-Jennifer Connor.
-Aye, that's it.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.670
I'd high hopes
for the two of you.

22:15.713 --> 22:19.926
She was six and I was seven.

22:20.009 --> 22:25.098
-So, should I be
looking for a new hat?
-Do you need one?

22:25.181 --> 22:29.018
-Well, if there's
an event in the offing.
-Event?

22:30.061 --> 22:32.063
One that involves bells.

22:34.232 --> 22:38.027
-What? Me and Duncan?
-You are round for your tea.

22:38.111 --> 22:40.738
This is the 21st century.

22:40.822 --> 22:45.410
We're not about to trade
lifelong commitment for
a slice of jam sponge.

22:45.493 --> 22:46.911
Are we?

22:49.455 --> 22:54.168
I just thought it would be a
good idea if you two got to
know each other.

22:54.252 --> 22:56.879
-That's all.
-I see.

22:56.963 --> 23:01.175
And here's me thinking
I might be hearing
the patter of tiny feet.

23:02.677 --> 23:04.762
Why? Are the mice back?

23:04.846 --> 23:09.684
I can't buy it because
of a 300-year-old treaty?
That's preposterous.

23:09.767 --> 23:13.938
We'll see. But I'm
afraid your rescue attempt
might have been in vain.

23:14.022 --> 23:17.525
-Well, is there any
other way I can help?
-I don't see how.

23:18.985 --> 23:21.320
But all
suggestions are very welcome.

23:21.404 --> 23:24.365
Then I'll put on my
thinking cap forthwith.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.410
-Friends again?
-Oh, yes.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.203
I'd better get back.

23:30.163 --> 23:31.748
Nil desperandum.

23:36.294 --> 23:38.838
I don't know where
these cobwebs come from.

23:38.921 --> 23:43.634
-More sherry, Mrs MacDonald?
-No, thank you,
and I'll see myself out.

23:47.013 --> 23:52.060
McGREGOR: These are
the estates covered by the
treaty and, as you can see,

23:52.143 --> 23:55.271
Glenbogle is
indeed one of them.

23:55.355 --> 23:57.815
-Is it genuine, then?
-Very much so.

23:57.899 --> 24:02.028
When it was drawn up,
land was everything.

24:02.111 --> 24:05.698
Lose the smallest piece
and it was a sign of
weakness and failure.

24:05.782 --> 24:10.745
And so you'd also lose face
in front of the other
great land-owning families.

24:10.828 --> 24:13.748
-I can think of worse things.
-Yes, but more importantly,

24:13.831 --> 24:16.417
it meant that the laird
who needed to make the sale

24:16.501 --> 24:19.629
could no longer be trusted
with the rest
of what he owned.

24:19.712 --> 24:24.092
-Whatever the circumstances?
-They were very
unforgiving times.

24:24.175 --> 24:27.804
Yes, but that was then
and this is now. Surely
it can't be valid today.

24:27.887 --> 24:30.807
Well, it's a precedent
that's never been tested,

24:30.890 --> 24:34.852
so there's a chance it
could still be considered
legally binding by a court.

24:34.936 --> 24:36.688
-Even if we had no idea
that it existed?

24:36.771 --> 24:39.232
Ignorance, I'm afraid,
is no excuse.

24:41.651 --> 24:47.156
-So, what do we do now?
-Possession is
nine-tenths of the law,

24:47.240 --> 24:51.369
so I'd advise
selling to Lord Kilwillie
as speedily as possible.

24:51.452 --> 24:54.789
Once that pocket of land is
his and you've paid
the death duties,

24:54.872 --> 24:57.417
there'll be very
little Greg can do.

25:04.966 --> 25:09.220
Kilwillie! I presume there's
a reason why you're looking so
pleased with yourself.

25:09.303 --> 25:12.223
Come with me and
you'll find out.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.768
Kilwillie, what's happening?

25:17.478 --> 25:19.480
All aboard the skylark.

25:20.940 --> 25:24.902
Oh, a picnic!
What a wonderful surprise.

25:24.986 --> 25:26.904
Well, I thought you needed
cheering up.

25:26.988 --> 25:29.157
Kilwillie, I've got
the contract for you.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.326
-Not a good moment, Archie.
-All I need is a signature.

25:32.410 --> 25:35.329
I make it a rule
never to commit
on an empty stomach.

25:35.413 --> 25:39.500
Especially not this early
when who knows what
the day may bring.

25:41.627 --> 25:42.837
Archie!

25:43.713 --> 25:45.715
You'd better come here.

25:52.180 --> 25:53.348
Okay.

25:55.058 --> 25:56.809
-Did he sign?
-Not yet.

25:56.893 --> 25:58.436
Then it's too late.

25:58.519 --> 26:01.230
Greg MacDonald's had
an emergency
injunction granted.

26:01.314 --> 26:04.442
As of 10 minutes ago,
there's a block
on your land sale.

26:04.525 --> 26:07.528
-So we can't
sell to Kilwillie?
-Or to anybody else.

26:07.612 --> 26:09.155
Then the death duties
won't get paid.

26:09.238 --> 26:11.032
I'm sure I need
hardly remind you

26:11.115 --> 26:13.951
that the consequences of that
are potentially disastrous.

26:14.035 --> 26:17.330
-Where can I find him?
-Greg? Oh, they're
staying in the village,

26:17.413 --> 26:20.333
at the Glenbogle
Rose Guest House.

26:20.416 --> 26:22.210
-Right.
-LEXIE: Where are you going?

26:22.293 --> 26:24.128
Where do you think?

26:27.548 --> 26:28.800
KILWILLIE: Do you want
some more wine?

26:28.883 --> 26:31.386
MOLLY: Oh, just a little.
Thank you.

26:31.469 --> 26:34.764
Now, what's next I wonder?

26:34.847 --> 26:39.352
-Oh, I've had enough, really.
-This is
the special of the day.

26:39.435 --> 26:41.145
Indulge me, Molly.

26:51.531 --> 26:52.865
Kilwillie?

26:55.159 --> 26:58.663
I'm not a chap who finds
this sort of thing easy,

26:58.746 --> 27:02.500
but, oh,
Molly, I'd like to marry you.

27:05.003 --> 27:08.339
I really don't
know what to say.

27:09.549 --> 27:11.968
Well,
"yes" would be rather nice.

27:13.261 --> 27:17.306
I know your feelings
aren't the same as mine,

27:17.390 --> 27:22.270
but, over the years,
perhaps you might
grow to love me.

27:23.062 --> 27:24.313
A bit.

27:27.066 --> 27:30.403
-This really
isn't the right time.
-Oh, but it is.

27:30.486 --> 27:32.655
Don't you see it's
exactly the right time?

27:32.739 --> 27:34.991
It occurred to me
yesterday after you left,
if you marry me,

27:35.074 --> 27:39.328
I'd be family and my money
could help you keep Glenbogle.

27:39.412 --> 27:42.123
But I thought it was
the land that you were after.

27:42.206 --> 27:45.668
Well, I'd rather
have you as my wife.

27:46.794 --> 27:50.048
I really believe you mean it.

27:50.131 --> 27:52.342
I don't think for a minute
I'd ever replace Hector,

27:52.425 --> 27:56.929
but we both know what
the estate meant to him,
and we can save it.

27:57.013 --> 28:00.725
If you would just
consider taking me
as your husband.

28:04.187 --> 28:07.565
I need some time
to think it over.

28:09.817 --> 28:13.905
Expected to find us
in some fancy hotel,
I suppose?

28:13.988 --> 28:16.491
But a bed and hot food,
that's all we need.

28:16.574 --> 28:20.036
Well, then,
why do you want Glenbogle?

28:20.119 --> 28:23.748
It deserves to be in the hands
of someone who
respects tradition.

28:23.831 --> 28:27.919
-And you think that I don't?
-It's been my family's
home for generations.

28:28.002 --> 28:30.880
But you're ready to
sell bits of it off.

28:30.963 --> 28:33.591
-I have no choice.
-Don't give me that.

28:33.675 --> 28:35.760
I've tried every other option.

28:35.843 --> 28:39.597
Like your
newfangled wildlife park?

28:39.681 --> 28:41.724
And the folk you
let up to visit it...

28:41.808 --> 28:43.851
Well, if you mean
our visitors, then they're
what keep us going.

28:43.935 --> 28:46.062
Not once I'm laird,
they won't.

28:46.145 --> 28:49.565
-You can't just shut
the place to the public.
-Why not?

28:49.649 --> 28:54.028
-I've no need of their money.
-Yes, but a lot of
people living round here do.

28:54.112 --> 28:56.280
Their livelihoods
would be in your hands.

28:56.364 --> 29:01.369
Being the laird is not just
a title, there are
obligations that go with it.

29:05.164 --> 29:09.127
-He has a fair point.
-You've had your chance.

29:09.210 --> 29:12.672
I'll run
the place as I think fit.

29:12.755 --> 29:16.843
-This injunction
won't change anything.
-Brave words.

29:16.926 --> 29:18.428
But I think you'll
find it will

29:18.511 --> 29:20.805
once the interest
on those death duties
starts accruing.

29:20.888 --> 29:23.850
-Unless I pay them.
-Which we both know you can't.

29:23.933 --> 29:27.854
And I'll make sure
that any court case
is as drawn out as possible.

29:27.937 --> 29:32.900
Ultimately, you could
be left with nothing.

29:32.984 --> 29:37.947
That is unless you decide to
make it easy on yourself,
I could buy it from you now.

29:38.031 --> 29:40.199
You still don't
get it, do you?

29:40.283 --> 29:43.494
This isn't just about me,
I can't give in.

29:43.578 --> 29:48.082
In that case,
may the better man win.

29:55.214 --> 29:58.843
So, just when we thought
things couldn't get any worse.

30:01.512 --> 30:03.431
That settles it, then.

30:07.185 --> 30:10.355
That's marvellous.
Isn't it, Badger?

30:10.438 --> 30:12.774
Yes, my Lord. Wonderful.

30:12.857 --> 30:15.068
Champagne I think. The '73.

30:15.151 --> 30:18.154
But I thought we
were saving that
for a special occasion.

30:18.237 --> 30:19.947
Well, this is it.

30:20.031 --> 30:22.283
If you say so, my Lord.

30:22.367 --> 30:25.244
Er, none for me,
thank you, Badger.

30:25.328 --> 30:28.039
-Well, surely a toast
to our future.
-I must get back,

30:28.122 --> 30:30.249
tell them all the good news.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.543
Well, you're right, of course.

30:32.627 --> 30:37.924
And after all, we'll be
popping corks together
for many years to come.

30:46.432 --> 30:52.105
And if the worst does happen,
then you might have
to find other jobs.

30:52.188 --> 30:55.066
-What would I do?
-It probably
won't come to that.

30:55.149 --> 30:58.111
I just thought I ought
to tell you how we stand.

30:58.194 --> 31:00.154
Thanks, it's appreciated.

31:00.238 --> 31:03.866
Archie, I think your
problems might be over.

31:03.950 --> 31:07.537
I'm going to marry Kilwillie.

31:07.620 --> 31:11.207
-But you can't
really be serious.
-It's the perfect solution.

31:11.290 --> 31:14.293
He's got lots of money,
Glenbogle will be rescued

31:14.377 --> 31:18.006
and,
well, being Lady Kilwillie
can't be all that bad.

31:18.089 --> 31:19.465
I wouldn't put my
last pound on it.

31:19.549 --> 31:21.884
Well, look how
long we've struggled.

31:21.968 --> 31:25.138
-This will secure
all our futures.
-Yes, but at what cost?

31:25.221 --> 31:27.724
There isn't one.
Everybody gets what they want.

31:27.807 --> 31:31.477
-Except you, you'd be
sacrificing your happiness.
-Archie's right.

31:31.561 --> 31:34.814
-I'm sorry, I don't agree.
-I won't let you do it.

31:34.897 --> 31:37.775
My mind's made up,
you can't stop me now.

31:45.283 --> 31:50.455
-So, what do we do now?
-I haven't got a clue.

31:50.538 --> 31:53.541
I'll tell you one thing, she's
not gonna walk up the aisle
with Kilwillie to save us.

31:53.624 --> 31:57.253
-I agree.
-I've got an idea.

32:18.941 --> 32:20.818
Well, now, Hector...

32:24.280 --> 32:28.034
I think this could be the end
of Glenbogle as we know it.

32:31.204 --> 32:32.372
Golly?

32:35.208 --> 32:37.710
-I thought it was you.
-Aye, aye.

32:42.715 --> 32:45.176
-Morag.
-Hello.

32:45.259 --> 32:47.679
-Can we talk?
-Yes.

32:47.762 --> 32:51.516
But if you're who
I think you are,
I can't do much to help.

32:51.599 --> 32:54.310
But surely you can't
agree with what Greg's doing?

32:54.394 --> 32:56.646
He's my husband.

32:56.729 --> 33:00.149
I love him,
despite his faults.

33:00.233 --> 33:04.070
-This is his dream.
-But is it what
you want, though?

33:04.153 --> 33:07.990
He thinks Glenbogle should be
kept as a monument to
the glory of the clan.

33:08.074 --> 33:11.369
When it's between them and me,
I'm used to coming second.

33:11.452 --> 33:14.163
Yeah, well, I suppose neither
of us could have
known what we were

33:14.247 --> 33:16.249
letting ourselves in for, eh?

33:16.332 --> 33:18.084
Marrying into this family.

33:18.167 --> 33:20.003
-But I didn't.
-Eh?

33:20.086 --> 33:22.588
Well, I'm the MacDonald.

33:22.672 --> 33:25.466
When Greg married me,
he took my name.

33:29.637 --> 33:33.683
Don't know why I
didn't think of looking
in churchyards before.

33:35.727 --> 33:37.395
GOLLY: Is that it?

33:38.855 --> 33:43.526
Grandmother.
The last of the Rosses.

33:43.609 --> 33:46.195
That's according to
the gravedigger there.

33:46.279 --> 33:48.614
-I remember her now.
-Really?

33:48.698 --> 33:51.576
She used to have
an apple tree in her garden.

33:51.659 --> 33:57.415
When I was a wee boy I
used to just help myself,
until she gave me a thick ear.

33:57.498 --> 34:00.084
She never stood for
any nonsense, Mrs Ross.

34:00.168 --> 34:03.212
Apparently she died
a very lonely old lady.

34:04.797 --> 34:07.425
-I didn't know.
-He told me.

34:08.885 --> 34:12.138
She worked on the Tavistock
estate all her life.

34:12.221 --> 34:18.143
Then when they sold it, the
rest of her family and her few
friends moved away.

34:18.226 --> 34:21.856
Well, they had to,
there was no
other work round here.

34:23.358 --> 34:25.318
-But not her, though?
-No.

34:26.819 --> 34:30.197
She reckoned she was
too old to up sticks.

34:30.281 --> 34:33.576
So that's it, then?

34:33.659 --> 34:37.789
You don't have any
living relatives in the area.

34:37.871 --> 34:40.083
No, that's it.

34:41.751 --> 34:43.585
The end of my search.

34:48.007 --> 34:50.717
Time to be moving on. Again.

34:58.559 --> 35:00.728
-Don't say anything,
I just want you to listen.
-But...

35:00.812 --> 35:02.021
Please.

35:04.107 --> 35:06.693
There's no easy
way to say this
and for the time being,

35:06.776 --> 35:09.696
-I don't want it
going any further.
-What?

35:11.572 --> 35:13.074
I'm pregnant.

35:14.659 --> 35:18.204
-I'm gonna be a dad?
-No.

35:18.287 --> 35:21.666
-But you just said...
-It's not yours.

35:21.749 --> 35:25.169
-I don't understand.
-It can't be.

35:25.253 --> 35:28.047
We haven't been
together long enough.

35:28.131 --> 35:32.885
-So you've been
seeing somebody else?
-Before I came here.

35:32.969 --> 35:35.930
Isn't there a tiny
chance it might be mine?

35:36.888 --> 35:38.057
Sorry.

35:45.898 --> 35:49.359
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

36:06.919 --> 36:12.717
I must be the world's
luckiest man, eh, Badger?

36:12.799 --> 36:16.054
Mmm. Your crackers, my Lord.

36:18.513 --> 36:21.768
Now, the honeymoon.
Caribbean or the Med?

36:21.851 --> 36:23.728
Of course,
it does rather depend on
the time of year,

36:23.811 --> 36:26.022
but we shouldn't leave it
too long to tie the knot.

36:26.105 --> 36:27.690
And on the day itself,

36:27.774 --> 36:32.028
I thought if we could
just keep it down
to 300 guests each.

36:32.111 --> 36:35.573
Much more than that, it
all gets a bit out of hand.

36:35.656 --> 36:37.325
Whatever you think.

36:37.408 --> 36:43.206
Wedding car.
Bentley, or we could
stretch to a limousine.

36:43.289 --> 36:47.418
-I really don't mind.
-No, that was a joke,
stretch limousine.

36:48.544 --> 36:50.838
Oh, yes, very amusing.

36:50.922 --> 36:52.632
Well, it makes us laugh,
eh, Badger?

36:52.715 --> 36:55.218
On a regular basis,
your Lordship.

36:57.053 --> 36:59.764
You'll get to know my
sense of humour, my dear.

36:59.847 --> 37:04.268
And all my little
ways and habits.

37:04.352 --> 37:08.648
-All right,
Badger, you can leave us.
-Yes, your Lordship.

37:08.731 --> 37:13.194
Only, I was wondering
if I should air a spare room?

37:13.277 --> 37:16.280
-For what reason?
-Well, some engaged couples

37:16.364 --> 37:19.367
-have a more modern...
-(STAMMERING) All right,
point taken.

37:19.450 --> 37:23.329
Actually,
I'll be going home tonight.

37:24.664 --> 37:29.293
Oh, right, well, absolutely.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.004
Whatever you say.

37:48.312 --> 37:51.691
-Mother?
-Archie. You're still up.

37:51.774 --> 37:55.153
-So, how was your evening?
-Oh, fine.

37:55.236 --> 37:59.449
-No, it wasn't.
-I had a thoroughly
enjoyable evening.

37:59.532 --> 38:01.784
So why do you look so down?

38:04.203 --> 38:07.206
How do you think
it makes me feel
seeing you like this?

38:07.290 --> 38:10.168
-It'll get better.
-You don't know that.

38:10.251 --> 38:12.420
It's me that's failed,
why should you have to suffer?

38:12.503 --> 38:17.842
Oh, Archie, you haven't
failed. As much as I
loved your father,

38:17.925 --> 38:22.388
we both know that this place
was in even more of a mess
before you came back.

38:22.472 --> 38:24.349
And he loved you, too.

38:25.933 --> 38:29.437
What do you think he'd make
of what you're doing now?

38:31.064 --> 38:33.358
-He'd understand.
-No.

38:34.650 --> 38:36.944
He'd want you to be happy,

38:37.028 --> 38:41.032
but you won't be
if you do this,
and neither will Kilwillie.

38:42.283 --> 38:44.619
It's not fair
on either of you.

38:47.580 --> 38:52.043
Maybe... Maybe I'll
speak to him in the morning.

39:15.274 --> 39:17.110
(CLEARING THROAT)

39:17.193 --> 39:22.073
Oh, Molly, back so soon?
Come and sit down.

39:22.156 --> 39:24.659
-Would you like
a cup of coffee?
-I can't stay.

39:24.742 --> 39:30.123
I'll be in the pantry if
you need me, your Lordship.

39:30.206 --> 39:33.501
I was thinking of popping over
to see if you
fancied a spot of luncheon.

39:33.584 --> 39:36.546
-I'm not hungry.
-Oh, I'm much the same myself.

39:36.629 --> 39:40.008
I could only manage three
rashers and half a round of
black pudding this morning.

39:40.091 --> 39:42.760
It's the excitement,
that's what it'll be.

39:42.844 --> 39:45.388
Kilwillie...

39:45.471 --> 39:49.600
I'm sorry,
but I've changed my mind.
I can't marry you.

39:54.897 --> 39:58.317
It's just a touch of nerves,
that's all.

39:58.401 --> 40:02.530
-No doubt I'll be
getting butterflies, too.
-I'm afraid I mean it.

40:04.449 --> 40:06.117
No, you don't.

40:08.786 --> 40:14.000
You're a good man, Kilwillie,
but if I were to
become Lady Kilwillie,

40:14.083 --> 40:18.338
it would be for your money,
and that's no
basis for a marriage.

40:18.421 --> 40:22.216
-Isn't it?
-Well, not in my book.

40:25.178 --> 40:27.555
I'm willing to
risk it if you are.

40:27.638 --> 40:30.183
(SIGHING) But I'm not.

40:35.396 --> 40:36.606
I see.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.153
Well, you can't
blame a chap for trying.

40:46.532 --> 40:51.704
Oh, no. No, no, you keep it.
It'll only remind me
of what might have been.

40:53.206 --> 40:54.457
Please.

41:00.713 --> 41:03.299
We can still stay friends,
can't we?

41:05.009 --> 41:07.553
I was rather
hoping you'd say that.

41:34.372 --> 41:37.083
Another cup, my Lord?

41:37.166 --> 41:40.920
Er, no, thank you, Badger.
You can take it away.

41:44.424 --> 41:47.468
I know it must be
small consolation, my Lord,

41:48.970 --> 41:51.597
but you've always got me.

41:51.681 --> 41:54.600
And a truer servant
no man could wish for.

41:56.269 --> 41:59.230
Maybe I should just
be content with my lot.

42:01.816 --> 42:04.277
I can't imagine a woman being
more capable
in the kitchen, or

42:04.360 --> 42:06.362
neater with a
needle and thread.

42:06.446 --> 42:08.990
I'm pretty nifty
with a duster, too.

42:11.034 --> 42:15.079
Now,
if you'll excuse me, my Lord,
I have your bath to draw.

42:16.372 --> 42:18.166
Ducks or battleships?

42:19.417 --> 42:21.252
Why don't you choose?

42:22.712 --> 42:24.422
Very good, my Lord.

42:36.225 --> 42:38.978
-Here we go.
-Are you sure about this?

42:39.062 --> 42:40.438
Absolutely.

42:43.733 --> 42:45.610
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

43:00.208 --> 43:02.210
You did the right thing.

43:04.754 --> 43:07.674
But we're still no
nearer getting the money.

43:07.757 --> 43:09.926
Well, I did have one idea.

43:12.804 --> 43:15.890
I couldn't do it
without asking you first.

43:30.530 --> 43:31.906
How's that?

43:34.492 --> 43:37.203
-Well done.
-That is terrific.

43:37.286 --> 43:38.955
Not bad.

43:43.793 --> 43:46.129
Greg, it's Archie MacDonald.

43:46.212 --> 43:49.298
Why don't you come over?
I have a proposition for you.

43:55.596 --> 43:58.725
I wish for Archie
to keep Glenbogle.

44:12.613 --> 44:14.282
(SCREAMING)

44:28.463 --> 44:30.923
I hope this isn't
another wasted trip.

44:31.007 --> 44:34.010
-It's time we settled
this once and for all.
-I couldn't agree more.

44:34.093 --> 44:37.013
Good. Then I
challenge you to a duel.

44:37.096 --> 44:41.559
Sorry? My privilege as laird,
as laid down in
the amendments to the treaty.

44:41.642 --> 44:44.145
But there are no amendments.

44:44.228 --> 44:46.564
I was meticulous
in my research.

44:47.398 --> 44:49.067
So what's this?

44:53.279 --> 44:58.993
Any territorial dispute within
the clan can be settled by
pistol or sword.

44:59.077 --> 45:03.664
So you win, Glenbogle's yours.
I win, and you never
come back here again.

45:06.292 --> 45:08.628
You're mad.

45:08.711 --> 45:11.130
Like I said,
he can talk the talk
but when it comes down to it

45:11.214 --> 45:14.634
-he just hasn't got what
it takes to be the laird.
-What's that supposed to mean?

45:14.717 --> 45:19.180
I told you, it's not
about how much you're worth,
it's about respect and honour.

45:19.263 --> 45:21.057
And ultimately,
it means being prepared to

45:21.140 --> 45:24.769
die to protect what's yours
and what you believe in.

45:24.852 --> 45:29.190
And if you're not ready
to do that, then you're not
worthy of taking my place.

45:29.273 --> 45:32.110
But then I shouldn't be
surprised when you're not
even a MacDonald.

45:32.193 --> 45:35.113
-I'm every bit
the man you are.
-Then prove it.

45:35.196 --> 45:38.741
-Right, I will.
-You will not.

45:38.825 --> 45:42.328
Do you think I'm going to risk
losing you for the sake of
some stupid quest?

45:42.412 --> 45:46.207
-You keep out of this, Morag.
-No, I've put up with enough.

45:46.290 --> 45:48.584
I'm not going to stand by
and watch you get
yourself killed.

45:48.668 --> 45:50.545
I'm not backing down.

45:51.963 --> 45:54.257
Well, in that case,

45:56.843 --> 45:59.345
I'm the MacDonald,

45:59.429 --> 46:03.307
so if there's
going to be a duel,
it'll be me fighting it.

46:04.267 --> 46:07.478
-Oh, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

46:08.855 --> 46:11.566
Taking on a woman,
it wouldn't be right.

46:11.649 --> 46:17.447
In that case, I'll see you
in court and you'll be made
to give up Glenbogle.

46:17.530 --> 46:18.990
Come away, Morag.

46:19.073 --> 46:20.700
LEXIE: Archie!

46:22.243 --> 46:24.203
We've got the money.

46:29.167 --> 46:32.003
-How?
-Because of Golly and Lexie.

46:35.423 --> 46:37.592
Well, it looks like
we won't be going
to court after all.

46:37.675 --> 46:40.136
And you don't have to fight.

46:40.219 --> 46:42.096
Yes, he will.

46:43.598 --> 46:46.684
-You can't back down now.
-You just did.

46:46.768 --> 46:49.854
But I didn't
make the challenge.

46:49.937 --> 46:54.067
And I thought you
were prepared to die
for what you believed in.

46:57.653 --> 46:59.489
Pistols or swords?

47:04.160 --> 47:06.287
Remember. 10 paces a man.

47:08.539 --> 47:11.751
Greg,
Duncan will be your second.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.760
You're not really
gonna go through
with this, are you?

47:20.843 --> 47:22.053
He needs to be taught
a lesson.

47:22.136 --> 47:24.931
It wasn't
supposed to come to this.

47:25.014 --> 47:27.517
Just remember one thing.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.060
I love you.

47:40.405 --> 47:42.156
Are you both ready?

47:43.991 --> 47:46.077
GREG: Aye.

47:46.160 --> 47:51.582
As the challenge was made by
Archie MacDonald, his opponent
will take the first shot.

47:51.666 --> 47:53.710
In your own time.

48:03.803 --> 48:05.221
(GREG EXCLAIMING)

48:06.973 --> 48:08.349
(MOLLY AND LEXIE CHEERING)

48:08.433 --> 48:10.184
It's not over yet.

48:12.145 --> 48:13.396
Archie.

48:19.736 --> 48:21.779
I don't have to do this.

48:29.287 --> 48:30.747
Last chance.

48:37.337 --> 48:39.172
Okay, okay, you win.

48:40.048 --> 48:42.091
-Duncan.
-What?

48:42.175 --> 48:44.719
-You have to take his place.
-Do I?

48:44.802 --> 48:47.972
You're his second,
it's in the rules.

48:51.893 --> 48:54.354
Right, fine.

48:54.437 --> 48:59.150
For goodness sake,
man, it's over, I was joking.
What's the matter with you?

49:06.824 --> 49:10.244
It's over, Greg, and I'm glad.

49:12.705 --> 49:18.711
Because it's you I care about,
not living in
some stupid pile.

49:18.795 --> 49:20.838
You're just saying that.

49:22.715 --> 49:24.509
I don't deserve you.

49:27.095 --> 49:29.138
I won't argue with that.

49:32.975 --> 49:36.688
As we're not
buying the estate,

49:36.771 --> 49:40.066
perhaps we could treat
ourselves to a taxi back.

49:41.109 --> 49:43.152
Wouldn't you rather walk?

49:44.028 --> 49:45.947
It's only eight miles.

49:51.327 --> 49:54.664
-Well done, Archie.
-You're the real hero.

49:54.747 --> 49:56.499
I know how much
your home meant to you.

49:56.582 --> 49:59.085
If you hadn't
found that document...

49:59.168 --> 50:02.005
Ah, yes, well I didn't,
it was all Lexie's work.

50:02.088 --> 50:04.716
You didn't know that
we had a resident forger,
did you?

50:04.799 --> 50:09.679
-I don't believe it.
-Greg did,
though, fortunately.

50:09.762 --> 50:13.516
Doon Brae is still
your favourite part
of the estate, isn't it?

50:13.599 --> 50:17.603
-It is, yes.
-Well, you know the old
ruined cottage up there.

50:17.687 --> 50:20.773
It'll take a lot of work,
but it's yours if you want it.

50:20.857 --> 50:22.650
Sounds good.

50:22.734 --> 50:25.820
One question, though,
what if he hadn't missed?

50:25.903 --> 50:29.866
There was no danger at all.
I sent Duncan to get
the pistols from Kilwillie

50:29.949 --> 50:32.702
but I told him to
put the powder in,
not the bullets.

50:32.785 --> 50:35.580
I knew you had
something up your sleeve.

50:36.873 --> 50:38.750
-I forgot.
-What?

50:40.752 --> 50:42.337
You're kidding.

50:43.755 --> 50:46.299
You'd still be safe enough.

50:46.382 --> 50:50.845
These aren't accurate
at six feet and you were at
least 15 yards apart.

50:52.513 --> 50:55.600
Look, I'm gonna aim at
that dead branch there.

51:04.901 --> 51:06.069
Archie.
