been difficult for you,

35:03.090 --> 35:07.810
and that whatever decision
I make will affect you a lot,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.940
but not as much
as it will affect me.

35:10.140 --> 35:12.510
This is my fate,

35:12.710 --> 35:14.330
my future,

35:14.530 --> 35:16.990
my life.

35:17.190 --> 35:19.690
I'm not going back
inside the CRC.

35:19.890 --> 35:21.780
What?

35:21.980 --> 35:24.040
I'm gonna choose my own path

35:24.240 --> 35:27.090
and be my own person,

35:27.290 --> 35:30.120
whoever that ends up being.

35:32.650 --> 35:34.270
That's it?

35:34.470 --> 35:36.090
What, I'm just supposed
to forget about Frost

35:36.290 --> 35:39.180
- and accept this?
- Yes,

35:39.380 --> 35:41.490
because I didn't choose this.

35:41.690 --> 35:42.410
Caitlin did

35:42.600 --> 35:44.800
when she created a person

35:45.000 --> 35:46.710
with feelings

35:46.910 --> 35:49.060
and free will,

35:49.260 --> 35:50.110
and I won't give that up

35:50.310 --> 35:51.720
to become someone I'm not.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.110
- Please, you don't
even have your own name.

35:54.310 --> 35:56.720
Actually, I do.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.340
I found out today
that my father always dreamed

35:59.530 --> 36:00.900
of creating something

36:01.100 --> 36:03.900
or someone new,

36:04.100 --> 36:06.910

36:07.110 --> 36:09.910

36:11.940 --> 36:14.130

Either way,
we can't control it.

36:16.730 --> 36:21.920
So I know
Caitlin and Frost are gone,

36:22.120 --> 36:24.230
and we can mourn the flowers

36:24.430 --> 36:26.840
that have fallen from the vine,

36:27.040 --> 36:29.020
but we can't ask a new bloom

36:29.220 --> 36:32.590
to give up its place
in exchange.
