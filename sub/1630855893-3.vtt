00:13.388 --> 00:14.723
Up!

00:19.394 --> 00:21.355
<i>I can't remember the day I was born.</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:23.982
<i>I can't remember my parents.</i>

00:23.982 --> 00:26.360
<i>I can't remember how I ended up
in this place</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:28.529
<i>where I so clearly wasn't built to be.</i>

00:29.488 --> 00:32.658
<i>The first thing I remember is fear.</i>

00:32.658 --> 00:35.619
Come on! Let's go!

00:35.619 --> 00:37.329
<i>I was there to be brave.</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:39.665
<i>I was trained to protect.</i>

00:39.665 --> 00:44.545
<i>I was supposed to act,
but instead, I was paralyzed.</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:46.088
Come on. Let's go.

00:47.506 --> 00:51.969
<i>I was a coward, and I hated myself for it.</i>

01:27.171 --> 01:29.298
- <i>And then...</i>
- You hungry, little fella?

01:29.298 --> 01:30.591
<i>...I met her.</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:33.594
Wait here. I'll be right back.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.387
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

01:35.387 --> 01:37.181
<i>I felt something other than fear.</i>

01:38.348 --> 01:39.766
<i>I felt safe.</i>

01:41.059 --> 01:43.520
<i>I felt love.</i>

01:45.689 --> 01:48.817
<i>And love, it can change things.</i>

01:51.987 --> 01:55.824
<i>I could protect her. I could protect him.</i>

02:03.373 --> 02:05.501
<i>That was my purpose.</i>

02:19.473 --> 02:20.599
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

02:22.392 --> 02:23.602
<i>I couldn't protect him.</i>

02:27.981 --> 02:29.024
<i>And in that moment,</i>

02:29.691 --> 02:33.403
<i>everything I ever thought about myself,
every worst fear I had,</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:35.739
<i>it all came true.</i>

05:22.114 --> 05:23.365
Personnel office. This is--

05:24.575 --> 05:26.034
Yeah, that's correct.

05:28.912 --> 05:29.913
What?

05:33.292 --> 05:35.878
Oh, my God. When?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.881
Just because things don't happen
on your time

05:38.881 --> 05:41.008
doesn't mean that
God doesn't have a plan for you.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.385
Joseph was betrayed by his brothers,

05:44.052 --> 05:46.305
sold into slavery,
but God had his own plan.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.806
Yes, he did.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.100
David was just a shepherd boy...

05:50.100 --> 05:52.519
- Mama. M--
- ...but God had his own plan.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.313
Where's Dr. Evans now?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.149
He's at the funeral home.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.278
I thought he was in the dirt.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.073
He's at the funeral home,
waiting to be buried on Tuesday.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.034
Where's his soul?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.537
His soul has gone
to heaven to be with God.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.206
Why not his body?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.082
It's in the dirt.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.502
Let's listen to the reverend, okay?

06:16.502 --> 06:19.171
- ...trust that he has a plan.
- Yes.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.924
For he will guide us to righteousness.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.258
Yes he will.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.260
- Amen.
- Amen.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.848
Gonna add Dr. Evans to my bedtime prayers.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.475
That's beautiful, sweetie.

06:31.475 --> 06:34.311
<i>Studying about that good old way</i>

06:34.311 --> 06:38.607
<i>And who shall wear the starry crown</i>

06:38.607 --> 06:42.903
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

06:44.279 --> 06:48.367
<i>O sisters, let's go down</i>

06:48.367 --> 06:51.745
<i>Let's go down, come on down</i>

06:51.745 --> 06:52.663
I'll be right back.

06:52.663 --> 06:56.708
<i>O sisters, let's go down</i>

06:56.708 --> 07:00.379
<i>Down to the river to pray</i>

07:01.505 --> 07:05.759
<i>As I went down to the river to pray</i>

07:05.759 --> 07:09.137
<i>Studying about that good old way</i>

07:09.137 --> 07:13.016
<i>And who shall wear the robe and crown</i>

07:13.016 --> 07:16.937
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

07:17.646 --> 07:21.316
<i>O brothers, let's go down</i>

07:21.316 --> 07:25.028
<i>Let's go down, come on down</i>

07:25.028 --> 07:28.991
<i>O brothers, let's go down</i>

07:28.991 --> 07:32.828
<i>Down to the river to pray</i>

07:33.537 --> 07:37.833
<i>As I went down to the river to pray</i>

07:37.833 --> 07:41.295
<i>Studying about that good old way</i>

07:41.295 --> 07:45.215
<i>And who shall wear the starry crown</i>

07:45.215 --> 07:48.802
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:16.163
Miss?

08:17.247 --> 08:20.334
Ralph Bailey. I'm writing a story
for the <i>Times</i> about Calvin Evans.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.503
I was just wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.505
I assume you're family.

08:25.589 --> 08:26.590
No.

08:28.175 --> 08:32.054
First two rows are usually reserved
for family, so I assumed...

08:33.972 --> 08:35.933
Well, could you tell me
how you knew him then?

08:35.933 --> 08:38.727
Maybe share an anecdote?
Did you know him long?

08:40.395 --> 08:41.395
No.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.691
No, you...

08:44.691 --> 08:48.862
No, I didn't know him long.
I didn't know him long enough.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.574
Well, I'd love to get some background.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.785
I've heard some things about him.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.080
One person I spoke to said
that he had his moments,

08:58.080 --> 09:00.707
and then another went so far
as to call him--

09:00.707 --> 09:03.293
I'm just quoting here--
that he could be a real jerk.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.881
Anyone who knew him would know
that is patently false.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.967
I thought you said
you didn't know him well.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.052
I said I didn't know him long enough.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.304
Right, that's what I said.
That you didn't know him very long.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.391
Wait, I don't think
you're supposed to have dogs here.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.892
I saw a sign on the way in.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.103
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:29.736 --> 09:35.534
For everything there is a season.
A time to be born and a time to die.

09:36.451 --> 09:40.747
Calvin Evans was a brilliant man,
a dedicated chemist

09:40.747 --> 09:44.001
and was always the life
and soul of the party.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.713
Calvin Evans had no living family.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.592
And although we cannot know
what God is planning for us,

09:51.592 --> 09:56.638
we must trust he is and will always be
one of God's children.

09:57.723 --> 10:01.643
As you, his loved ones, his community,
mourn this tragic loss,

10:01.643 --> 10:04.938
seek comfort in each other
and in Calvin's goodness.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.621
<i>She didn't speak to me for days.</i>

10:21.872 --> 10:24.791
<i>She didn't touch me.
She barely looked at me.</i>

10:33.008 --> 10:34.885
<i>I had hoped that
time would make her forget</i>

10:34.885 --> 10:37.721
<i>that it was my fault, but how could it?</i>

10:39.264 --> 10:43.185
<i>Because failures have
a way of being unforgettable.</i>

10:46.563 --> 10:49.024
- Did he ask you out?
- No, I don't want to talk about it.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.735
Look who it is. Don't stare, Bertha.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.613
I can't believe she's here.
The body's still warm.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.817
<i>I knew every one of his smells.</i>

11:32.651 --> 11:36.947
<i>The way he smelled after being wet.
The way he smelled after being outside.</i>

11:36.947 --> 11:38.949
<i>The way he smelled after a run.</i>

11:40.409 --> 11:43.745
<i>But in here, I smelled nothing.</i>

11:48.208 --> 11:49.209
It's fine.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.337
Elizabeth, you're here.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.549
Where are my things?
Where are Calvin's things?

11:55.549 --> 11:58.635
Miss Zott, it's too soon to be back here.
You need to rest.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.971
I need to work.
I need my notebooks, my research.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.514
Calvin and I are so cl-- Or,

12:02.514 --> 12:06.393
we were so close to submitting
for the Remsen grant. I cannot miss a day.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.687
Everything went down to storage.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.981
Okay. Do I fill out a form?

12:12.107 --> 12:14.651
Dr. Evans's work now belongs to Hastings.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.700
But that was our work. We were so close.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.287
Maybe there's a empty lab
I could use off-hours?

12:26.038 --> 12:28.999
I'm so sorry. It's just-- It's policy.

12:32.377 --> 12:38.133
What about his personal items?
His records, his clothes, his lab coat?

12:39.092 --> 12:44.181
I know the-- well, unusual relationship
that you and Dr. Evans had.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.557
But we have to wait.

12:45.557 --> 12:49.895
We have to see if maybe a brother
or blood relative

12:49.895 --> 12:52.272
that can step forward and claim it.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.734
I'm sorry. If you need to cry--

12:55.734 --> 12:56.818
I don't.

12:57.945 --> 13:02.950
I want to work.
I need to work, Fran. Please.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.745
Dear, I'm afraid
without a chemist to support--

13:10.958 --> 13:13.043
I'm sure money's tight.
Let me see what I can do.

13:13.043 --> 13:16.755
Maybe in the admin wing.
But Dr. Evans's dog--

13:17.339 --> 13:20.467
If you can come back without the dog,
I can get you squared away.

13:24.012 --> 13:24.930
Thank you.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.607
<i>When she left each morning,
I was terrified.</i>

13:36.441 --> 13:38.569
<i>Because what if she never came back?</i>

13:38.569 --> 13:42.072
I'm leaving you food.
It will be ready at exactly 3:30 p.m.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.074
I'm putting on the TV.

13:44.074 --> 13:47.411
Cartoons, which I normally would avoid,
but given the circumstances,

13:47.411 --> 13:49.246
I feel preferable to the news.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.205
Back door's open...

13:50.205 --> 13:52.374
<i>But I couldn't help but feel relief,</i>

13:52.374 --> 13:55.043
<i>because I didn't have to face
what I had done.</i>

14:02.676 --> 14:07.347
Inasmuch as the word "gray" with an A

14:07.347 --> 14:10.267
is a more acceptable American spelling,

14:10.267 --> 14:15.230
your 14-across clue
"Earl blank tea" is incorrect.

14:15.230 --> 14:20.527
It must be spelled with an E,
because it was named after Charles Grey.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.072
You getting all this?

14:24.072 --> 14:26.325
I am, and it's riveting.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.702
Young lady, are you being smart?

14:29.995 --> 14:30.996
Definitely not.

14:49.264 --> 14:53.310
I know the timing is terrible
with Dr. Evans so close to submitting

14:53.310 --> 14:55.812
for one of our grants, but...

14:57.439 --> 14:58.857
I hope you understand

14:59.358 --> 15:04.488
that the Remsen Foundation needs
to start placing its money elsewhere.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.572
I assumed.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.909
But that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.914
It's been difficult to process
these past few days because

15:14.623 --> 15:17.376
Calvin was my dear friend
and also a lab mate.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.836
I didn't realize.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.672
That's why I wonder if--

15:22.256 --> 15:24.716
And I know this is a very big "if."

15:25.801 --> 15:28.512
I would like to carry on
the work of Dr. Evans.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.013
And not just for him,

15:30.013 --> 15:35.269
but to try and answer these big questions
that we have wrestled with for years.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.857
Let me bring it back to my board.

15:51.285 --> 15:52.286
I got you a gift.

15:53.996 --> 15:54.997
Sorry, sir?

15:55.831 --> 15:56.665
Open it.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.171
All right.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.259
I-- This is--

16:08.468 --> 16:11.805
Wow, this is Zott and Evans's work
on nucleotides.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.182
No, Dr. Boryweitz.

16:13.182 --> 16:17.019
That is Hastings's research
on nucleotides,

16:17.019 --> 16:19.605
and I would like you
to reproduce the results.

16:22.733 --> 16:26.361
I'd like to help you here, sir.
Really, I would. I just--

16:26.361 --> 16:29.615
I can't take credit
for something I didn't do.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.783
Then do it. With me.

16:31.783 --> 16:35.704
Look, if this research is as
groundbreaking as Evans said that it is,

16:35.704 --> 16:40.792
then let's you and I reproduce the results
step-by-step and make it ours.

16:42.794 --> 16:43.795
What about Miss Zott?

16:46.048 --> 16:50.427
Look, if you aren't up to the task,
I'll have to find somebody else instead.

16:58.060 --> 17:02.231
I guess it'd be a shame
to let Calvin's work go to waste.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.414
Excuse me.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.502
I thought you were expecting me.

19:28.502 --> 19:31.964
Dr. Donatti requested some samples
for the pharmacology lab.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.759
Of course. No one ever tells me anything.

19:37.094 --> 19:38.011
Take what you need.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.007
<i>I knew the baby was here
even before she did.</i>

22:20.757 --> 22:24.011
<i>The way I know it's going to rain
long before it does.</i>

22:27.848 --> 22:31.810
<i>And I thought maybe this could be
a new beginning for us.</i>

22:31.810 --> 22:32.895
<i>A new start.</i>

22:59.254 --> 23:02.382
Hello. Can I help you?

23:03.634 --> 23:06.220
Is everything okay? I was knocking.

23:06.220 --> 23:08.347
I'm building
an industrial-grade chemical lab.

23:10.057 --> 23:11.475
Is now a bad time?

23:11.475 --> 23:12.559
A bad time for what?

23:13.810 --> 23:18.315
This article in the <i>LA Times</i>,
it makes Calvin out to be a monster.

23:18.899 --> 23:22.069
"Even the lone individual seated
in the family section said, quote,

23:22.069 --> 23:24.196
'I didn't know him well,' unquote."

23:25.781 --> 23:27.449
That's horrible. I would never say that.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.619
Exactly.
It is journalistically irresponsible.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.287
We could file an injunction.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.042
Calvin didn't care
what anybody thought about him.

23:38.794 --> 23:39.920
This is history.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.547
What is written is now record.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.592
I'm gonna speak to someone at the <i>Times</i>.
I may need you to sign an affidavit.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.803
Probably won't come to that,
but I'll let you know how it goes.

23:48.679 --> 23:50.055
I'm sorry. Who are you?

23:51.557 --> 23:52.683
I'm Harriet Sloane.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.602
I live right across the street.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.437
Calvin was my friend.

24:00.774 --> 24:02.693
I'm sorry.
I'm not really myself right now.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.445
- Have a nice night.
- You too.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.043
<i>Something had lit up inside of me.</i>

24:20.544 --> 24:24.464
<i>I started spending every waking hour
at that window standing guard.</i>

24:25.424 --> 24:28.051
<i>I was given another chance
to keep my family safe.</i>

24:38.937 --> 24:42.149
<i>And I wouldn't fail again. I couldn't.</i>

24:43.192 --> 24:48.822
It wasn't until 1934
they started serving lunch in this room.

24:48.822 --> 24:54.953
It wasn't till 1939
before they began offering hot options.

24:55.662 --> 25:00.417
Irish spiced beef on Mondays.
Chicken and dumplings on Tuesdays.

25:01.001 --> 25:04.421
Or was that Wednesday? Sure I remember.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.007
- Wait. Was that when--
- Sorry. Excuse me, Mr. Astor.

25:11.637 --> 25:12.804
Let's see.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.473
Boryweitz,
can I speak with you for a moment?

25:15.641 --> 25:16.642
Of course.

25:18.519 --> 25:21.855
Elizabeth, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance
to tell you at the funeral,

25:21.855 --> 25:24.942
but I'm so sorry for your loss.

25:26.026 --> 25:27.236
I know you two were close.

25:27.945 --> 25:30.739
Thank you. Are you still seeing Laurel?

25:35.369 --> 25:36.370
You know?

25:37.204 --> 25:38.205
Everyone knows.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.251
Donatti took all of our things.

25:42.876 --> 25:43.961
Our research.

25:43.961 --> 25:45.671
Calvin's personal belongings.

25:45.671 --> 25:47.798
And I know that Laurel works
in the storage room.

25:47.798 --> 25:53.345
So, if you could ask her
if I could have something. Anything.

25:56.932 --> 25:58.684
I'll try. Yes.

26:00.561 --> 26:01.687
Thank you, Alfred.

26:09.570 --> 26:12.906
No, it was creamed chipped beef
on Tuesday,

26:13.907 --> 26:18.704
chicken and dumpling on Wednesday
and dreadful cod on Friday.

26:21.456 --> 26:22.583
<i>LA Times</i>.

26:34.011 --> 26:35.429
Sorry to keep you waiting.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.932
Today felt like two weeks already. Anyway.

26:38.932 --> 26:41.018
- Sorry I'm late, Mrs...
- Sloane.

26:41.018 --> 26:43.854
Mrs. Sloane. That's right.
Yes, I got your letter.

26:43.854 --> 26:46.315
We love when a new tip comes through.
What was it that you had?

26:46.315 --> 26:48.609
Something
about the White Wolf Fault earthquake--

26:48.609 --> 26:52.196
Actually, I came here to talk to you about
the article you wrote on Calvin Evans.

26:53.447 --> 26:54.990
Pretty dishy, right?

26:54.990 --> 26:56.992
What'd I miss?
He seemed like quite the odd duck.

26:56.992 --> 27:01.705
He wasn't an odd duck.
He was a brilliant man. A good man.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.166
What you wrote was inaccurate.

27:04.166 --> 27:07.503
And what you wrote was libel and wrong.
It is wrong.

27:07.503 --> 27:09.963
What exactly did I get wrong?

27:09.963 --> 27:12.090
Because if there are specific facts
in there, that's--

27:12.090 --> 27:14.551
It's the premise, the whole portrait.

27:14.551 --> 27:17.095
"While Evans was respected
in the scientific community,

27:17.095 --> 27:19.473
he was known to be somewhat of a recluse.

27:19.473 --> 27:22.142
Frigid with his peers
and shy with a laugh."

27:22.142 --> 27:27.356
Quote, "The man was as brilliant as he was
boring. Great mind, big drag," unquote.

27:27.356 --> 27:29.066
That's what you call journalism?

27:30.567 --> 27:32.778
Calvin was the warmest person I knew.

27:33.529 --> 27:36.073
If his mind was great,
his heart was greater.

27:36.073 --> 27:37.866
That should go in this article.

27:37.866 --> 27:39.701
- But those are quotes--
- Anonymous quotes.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.954
- From his colleagues.
- I'd like to see the transcripts.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.790
Be my guest.

27:46.124 --> 27:49.336
Look, I'm sorry. I am.

27:50.212 --> 27:52.548
But controversy and spice sell papers.

27:52.548 --> 27:53.924
I'm just trying to keep my job.

27:57.261 --> 27:59.263
As I told you,
it's been a very busy day around here.

27:59.263 --> 28:02.599
So, unless you have another story for me,
I have to get back to work.

28:21.660 --> 28:23.954
- Good evening.
- You started without me.

28:24.454 --> 28:26.331
No, of course not.
Just getting everything ready.

28:27.541 --> 28:29.126
I'm just a little confused.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.129
- Yes.
- We'll start here.

28:44.391 --> 28:46.560
Slow, slow, slow.

28:47.186 --> 28:48.604
Here, here.

28:49.438 --> 28:51.315
You added the silver carbonate first, right?

28:52.566 --> 28:53.650
I thought you did that.

29:08.582 --> 29:09.833
Does that look right to you?

29:11.502 --> 29:12.711
I think we missed something.

29:12.711 --> 29:13.795
No shit.

29:16.298 --> 29:17.841
Forgive me for being presumptuous,

29:17.841 --> 29:19.968
but I assume that this body adheres

29:19.968 --> 29:22.137
to the laws
of the United States Constitution.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.058
Okay. We're all in agreement.

29:26.058 --> 29:27.893
I adhere to the Constitution too.

29:31.146 --> 29:36.026
And I will assume that your adherence
includes all of the amendments.

29:36.026 --> 29:38.278
Even the 14th Amendment, which--

29:44.159 --> 29:48.539
Which guarantees all people...

29:49.957 --> 29:52.417
equal protection under the law.

29:52.417 --> 29:56.004
So--
And this is where it gets a little sticky.

29:56.004 --> 29:58.882
How is
the Beverly Property Owners Association

29:58.882 --> 30:04.179
afforded different rights
than me and my neighbors

30:04.763 --> 30:07.850
when it comes
to the construction of this freeway?

30:08.350 --> 30:13.814
Assuming we all receive equal protection.
Would any of you like to elucidate?

30:18.151 --> 30:21.446
No? Then I'll continue.

30:22.906 --> 30:28.579
This freeway that you want to build
to reduce our neighborhoods to nothing--

30:39.548 --> 30:43.802
Hi. Have to take Laurel
to Musso & Frank's for this.

30:44.553 --> 30:45.554
Please come in.

30:48.682 --> 30:49.683
It means so much.

30:50.851 --> 30:51.894
Not at all.

30:53.061 --> 30:59.860
But... Elizabeth, Laurel and I searched
the entire storeroom,

30:59.860 --> 31:01.737
but we didn't find your research.

31:02.863 --> 31:03.947
Maybe it was misplaced,

31:03.947 --> 31:07.075
or perhaps it was
accidentally thrown away.

31:07.075 --> 31:10.245
I just... I didn't see it.

31:13.081 --> 31:14.208
I'm so sorry.

31:15.209 --> 31:16.210
It's all right.

31:19.463 --> 31:20.672
Enjoy your dinner.

31:20.672 --> 31:21.757
Thanks.

32:02.881 --> 32:07.094
<i>I knew it was a small thing,
but it came with so many memories of him.</i>

32:08.095 --> 32:09.096
<i>Of us.</i>

32:10.180 --> 32:15.102
<i>He was here all along.
So why did they pack him away?</i>

32:29.908 --> 32:30.993
Mom!

32:32.286 --> 32:33.787
Mom, tell him to stop!

32:33.787 --> 32:35.330
Junior, put down the arrow.

32:35.330 --> 32:37.833
- Mom, she touched my bow!
- No, I didn't!

32:37.833 --> 32:38.750
Mom!

32:38.750 --> 32:40.836
- Don't hit me with it!
- Give it back!

32:41.420 --> 32:44.590
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I wanted you to have this.

32:46.049 --> 32:48.302
Or rather, Calvin did.

32:48.302 --> 32:50.262
- No, I'm not!
- Yeah, you are!

32:50.262 --> 32:52.306
This is my chair, not yours.

32:53.557 --> 32:55.893
- Do you wanna come in?
- No, it's fine.

32:55.893 --> 32:57.394
Mom, come get him!

32:57.936 --> 32:59.980
Give me a minute.
They'll calm down once they have food.

32:59.980 --> 33:01.273
But come on. Come in.

33:01.273 --> 33:02.983
- Dinner!
- Stop!

33:02.983 --> 33:04.401
No, you stop!

33:08.322 --> 33:09.698
He's touching me!

33:25.464 --> 33:28.717
I was so mad at him
the last conversation we had.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.470
And I still am, you know. So...

33:32.304 --> 33:34.681
now I'm mad at myself
for being mad at him.

33:38.769 --> 33:39.770
Do you like jazz?

33:41.438 --> 33:42.523
It's growing on me.

33:45.651 --> 33:48.028
When Calvin first moved in,
I hadn't seen him yet.

33:48.028 --> 33:49.238
Just the moving truck.

33:50.781 --> 33:53.283
So I go over there
with a welcome-to-the-neighborhood pie,

33:53.283 --> 33:56.078
and I hear Charlie Parker blaring
from inside.

33:56.578 --> 34:00.123
And I'm like, "This family has got taste."

34:01.917 --> 34:02.960
So, imagine my surprise

34:02.960 --> 34:05.921
when the only white boy
in a five-block radius answers the door.

34:08.799 --> 34:10.425
Did you ever see him dance?

34:12.302 --> 34:17.391
I saw him once through the window
and never let him live it down. And just--

34:18.600 --> 34:19.810
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

34:19.810 --> 34:24.606
- Just-- I cried.
- Got a lot of shoulders, a lot of head.

34:30.362 --> 34:31.362
God.

34:41.081 --> 34:43.375
So, can you now explain
to me why someone might need

34:43.375 --> 34:45.878
an industrial-grade lab in their kitchen?

34:47.880 --> 34:49.672
I have to finish our research.

34:56.471 --> 34:57.472
I'm...

34:59.558 --> 35:00.809
I'm a ticking clock.

35:07.774 --> 35:08.775
You're pregnant.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.528
- I can't do it.
- You can.

35:11.528 --> 35:12.988
I can't.

35:14.072 --> 35:17.409
No one can do it. But then you expand.

35:18.869 --> 35:21.330
You think you can't do it,
and you do it anyway.

35:22.915 --> 35:23.999
That's being a mother.

37:44.306 --> 37:45.516
Dr. Mason's office.

37:46.683 --> 37:49.561
Miss Zott.
It's nice to officially meet you.

37:50.145 --> 37:51.522
Please, call me Elizabeth.

37:52.689 --> 37:55.609
I am so very sorry for your loss.

37:55.609 --> 37:58.695
Evans was a good man.
A good man and a good rower.

38:00.113 --> 38:02.824
You should come rowing
with us as soon as you're ready.

38:03.325 --> 38:05.410
You're not exactly getting out there
in this condition.

38:05.410 --> 38:08.038
- I've been erging.
- Good God.

38:08.872 --> 38:10.707
Is that bad? Calvin built an erg.

38:10.707 --> 38:13.627
Well, yes, I would imagine he would,
but it's just--

38:13.627 --> 38:15.963
I've never heard
of anyone erging on purpose.

38:16.630 --> 38:18.048
How far are you erging?

38:18.048 --> 38:20.008
About 10,000 meters a day.

38:21.093 --> 38:24.513
I've always thought pregnant women
develop an extra capacity for suffering,

38:24.513 --> 38:26.390
but that will certainly prepare you
for childbirth.

38:27.766 --> 38:29.518
Well, it all looks good on your charts.

38:29.518 --> 38:32.312
But why in God's name has it taken you
so long to come in?

38:32.813 --> 38:34.064
You're in your last trimester.

38:37.609 --> 38:38.610
Well...

38:40.946 --> 38:47.077
I had, sort of, hoped that...
it would just take care of itself.

38:53.041 --> 38:56.128
Miss Zott,
do you have someone you can lean on?

38:56.128 --> 38:58.589
A friend or a relative? Your mother?

39:00.382 --> 39:01.383
Someone?

39:05.012 --> 39:06.013
I have a dog.

39:07.764 --> 39:09.850
Dogs can be good companions.

39:10.601 --> 39:13.437
And a neighbor that I sort of know.

39:20.152 --> 39:23.822
A dog,
a neighbor you sort of know and an erg.

39:25.741 --> 39:26.867
Excellent.

39:27.659 --> 39:30.829
As soon as you're able,
I wanna see you down at the boathouse.

39:31.496 --> 39:34.291
I realize it may take some time.
Let's say a year.

39:35.292 --> 39:36.877
My boat's been looking for
the right two-seat,

39:36.877 --> 39:38.420
and something tells me you're it.

39:38.420 --> 39:42.216
In the meantime,
try to relax and get some sleep.

39:42.758 --> 39:45.719
Soon, sleep is going to seem like
a distant memory.

40:00.150 --> 40:02.819
You're firing me. On what grounds?

40:02.819 --> 40:04.112
I think you know.

40:04.613 --> 40:05.864
I haven't the foggiest.

40:08.116 --> 40:09.618
You're with child.

40:09.618 --> 40:11.995
Yes, I am pregnant. That is correct.

40:12.788 --> 40:15.916
Mr. Astor, has my correspondence slowed
in the last month?

40:15.916 --> 40:18.043
Well, no.

40:18.043 --> 40:20.587
I'm not contagious. I do not have cholera.

40:20.587 --> 40:22.548
No one's going to catch having a baby
from me.

40:22.548 --> 40:24.883
You know very well
that women do not continue to work

40:24.883 --> 40:25.968
when they're pregnant.

40:25.968 --> 40:29.388
And you are not only pregnant,
you're unwed, and that is disgraceful.

40:29.388 --> 40:31.139
Pregnancy is a natural condition.

40:31.932 --> 40:33.851
It is how all human beings begin.

40:34.351 --> 40:36.603
Is she explaining pregnancy to me?

40:36.603 --> 40:39.231
- Who do you think you are?
- A woman.

40:40.148 --> 40:43.694
A fertilized zygote is 50% ovum
and 50% sperm.

40:43.694 --> 40:46.071
Would the man be fired in this situation?

40:46.947 --> 40:48.073
That would be fair. Correct?

40:48.699 --> 40:51.243
What man are you referring to? Evans?

40:51.243 --> 40:53.871
Any man. If an unwed woman gets pregnant,

40:53.871 --> 40:55.914
is the man
who gets her pregnant responsible

40:55.914 --> 40:57.875
and therefore also fired?

40:57.875 --> 41:00.127
- Would you fire Calvin?
- Of course not.

41:00.127 --> 41:02.004
Then you have no grounds to fire me.

41:02.754 --> 41:05.757
Of course I do. You're the woman.
You're the one who got knocked up.

41:06.258 --> 41:08.385
We have rules, Miss Zott.

41:08.385 --> 41:11.889
Not for this. I have read
the employee handbook front to back.

41:12.514 --> 41:13.765
It's an unwritten rule.

41:13.765 --> 41:16.602
And thus, not legally binding.

41:17.728 --> 41:20.355
Evans would be so ashamed
of you right now.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.318
No. No, he would not.

41:40.792 --> 41:41.627
Elizabeth.

41:42.503 --> 41:44.880
Hi. I was just about to come over.

41:44.880 --> 41:47.090
I was wondering if you had an axe
I could borrow.

41:47.758 --> 41:49.551
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

41:49.551 --> 41:51.637
I'm finding the sledgehammer
to be too limiting.

41:51.637 --> 41:52.804
I do not have an axe.

41:53.555 --> 41:55.224
Okay. Good night.

41:55.224 --> 41:57.309
Well, I was just about to
come knock on your door.

41:57.809 --> 41:59.728
The reporter wrote another article.

42:00.521 --> 42:03.023
"The council members were seen
visibly squirming in their seats

42:03.023 --> 42:05.067
as Harriet Sloane"-- that's me--

42:05.067 --> 42:08.111
"gave the room
a primer on constitutional law."

42:09.071 --> 42:10.531
I made them squirm.

42:14.326 --> 42:16.870
I swear, this sounds crazy,

42:16.870 --> 42:19.873
but I feel like
Calvin helped make this happen.

42:22.084 --> 42:25.003
- What do you mean?
- Well, I went down to the <i>Times</i>

42:25.003 --> 42:27.005
and demanded
that they write another article,

42:27.756 --> 42:29.132
and the reporter refused.

42:29.132 --> 42:31.093
Because that's not how newspapers work.

42:31.093 --> 42:33.095
But if I hadn't gone down there,

42:33.095 --> 42:35.055
the reporter never would've come
to the council meeting,

42:35.055 --> 42:37.224
and I never would've gotten
an article in the <i>LA Times</i>

42:37.224 --> 42:39.601
about a bunch of racists pretending
a freeway through my backyard

42:39.601 --> 42:40.894
is good for my community.

42:42.354 --> 42:44.606
And how did Calvin help with that?

42:46.483 --> 42:47.568
I don't know, I just...

42:50.612 --> 42:52.739
I know I felt him there in that room
with me.

42:58.495 --> 42:59.496
Good night.

42:59.496 --> 43:00.581
Elizabeth?

43:04.418 --> 43:05.627
Whatever you try not to feel...

43:08.505 --> 43:10.841
you're gonna have to let yourself feel it
at some point.

45:34.985 --> 45:37.738
<i>What can you say to someone
that's lost everything?</i>

45:42.868 --> 45:44.786
<i>And then it came to me.</i>

45:45.704 --> 45:48.457
<i>This thing Calvin used to say every time
we'd get tired of running.</i>

45:50.125 --> 45:52.336
<i>"That's the beauty of running," he'd say.</i>

45:55.088 --> 45:57.132
<i>When you don't think you can move forward.</i>

45:58.050 --> 45:59.510
<i>When you're sad about your yesterdays</i>

45:59.510 --> 46:01.595
<i>or not sure
what's going to happen tomorrow,</i>

46:02.387 --> 46:07.184
<i>your purpose is just being there
putting one foot in front of the other.</i>

46:09.269 --> 46:14.525
<i>One foot, one foot, one foot.</i>

46:19.029 --> 46:20.864
<i>It's all you have to think about.</i>

46:20.864 --> 46:23.200
<i>One foot. One foot.</i>

46:26.870 --> 46:30.415
<i>And then, sure enough, you'll be home.</i>
