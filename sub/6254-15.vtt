[ Saroyan ]
The victim was
found on the rocks...

00:05.298 --> 00:07.710
underneath
the New River Gorge Bridge.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.509
Slanted temporal bone,
prominent nasal spine...

00:11.596 --> 00:13.336
and the ectocranial
suture closure indicate...

00:13.431 --> 00:16.969
the decedent is male,
late 30s, early 40s.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.435
Nice call.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.602
The way he’s broken up,
I’d have l.D.’d him
as Humpty—Dumpty.

00:21.689 --> 00:25.682
The only fracturing I’ve seen
like this is from a skydiver
whose chute didn’t open.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.312
The New River Gorge Bridge.

00:27.403 --> 00:30.190
Ah, that thing is
over 876 feet high.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.771
We could be
looking at a suicide.

00:31.866 --> 00:35.529
He’s crawling with insects,
so time of death
should be simple.

00:35.620 --> 00:38.327
I’d say it looks like maybe
five or six days.

00:38.414 --> 00:42.032

and a tox screen.

00:42.126 --> 00:44.082
Some of the heart muscle’s
been recently damaged.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.788
Hey, if I was falling 876 feet,
I’d have a heart attack too.

00:47.882 --> 00:51.215
How soon can you
examine the tissue
and clean the bones?

00:51.302 --> 00:53.167
A few hours.
You can go home.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.969
Then I will put Christine to bed.
[ Sighs ]

00:56.057 --> 00:59.470
Perhaps she’ll enjoy
hearing Humpty—Dumpty.
[ Giggles ]

01:02.021 --> 01:04.683
So, you know, I’m thinking
maybe next month...

01:04.774 --> 01:08.358
me, you and Christine,
we could rent a cabin
at, uh, Palmer River,

01:08.444 --> 01:10.025
and we can
go fishing, huh?

01:10.112 --> 01:11.568
She’s 14 months old, Booth.

01:11.656 --> 01:13.237
She enjoys the comforts
of home...

01:13.324 --> 01:15.531
far more than she would
a cabin in the woods.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.028
Come on.
You don’t know that.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.781
There has been copious research
done by pediatricians...

01:19.872 --> 01:21.783
and cognitive specialists that—

01:21.874 --> 01:24.536
Bones, it’s a family thing, all right?
All of us will be together.

01:24.627 --> 01:29.587
— lt’s impractical, Booth.
— Sometimes it’s good
not to be practical.

01:29.674 --> 01:32.507
Sometimes it’s good
just to have fun, right?
Create memories.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.049
Christine wouldn’t retain
conscious access—

01:34.178 --> 01:36.294
[ Sighs ]
to a memory
made at 14 months.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.217
The neural network—
I’m sorry.
What is it with you, huh?

01:39.350 --> 01:41.466
Why are you angry?
Why?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.721
Because sometimes I would just
like us to do something...

01:43.813 --> 01:47.271
without you having to ask,
you know, some scientist
if it’s okay.

01:47.358 --> 01:48.939
I don’t want to fight
in front of Christine.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.142
Why? She won’t be able
to access her memory, huh?

01:51.237 --> 01:53.899
Why are you so afraid
to be spontaneous?

01:54.031 --> 01:56.943
You want Christine
to grow up like that?
So now I’m a bad mother?

01:57.034 --> 01:59.116
No! No!
I’m not saying that at all.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.946
Why don’t you put her to bed,
and I will go back to the lab
and finish my work.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.203
Whoa, wait a second.
You’re really
misunderstanding me here.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.205
You’ve been quite clear,
Booth.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.378
Being rational makes me no fun
and a bad mother.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.001
I didn’t say that.
I said that you’re not spontaneous.

02:13.092 --> 02:17.256
- There’s a difference there.
— Is this spontaneous enough
for you? Good—bye.

02:17.847 --> 02:19.337
Great.

02:28.232 --> 02:31.019
Civilization is based
on rational thought.

02:31.110 --> 02:34.602
There is no certainty
without evidence.

02:34.697 --> 02:38.440
To dismiss the empirical
with foolish emotionalism—

02:38.534 --> 02:39.990
[ Man ]
Somebody’s burning
the midnight oil.

02:40.077 --> 02:44.741
Oil hasn’t been used
as a light source for
over a hundred years, Hal.

02:44.874 --> 02:46.614
I thought someone
was here with you.
No.

02:46.709 --> 02:50.452
No, H was—
I was making notes.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.912
You gonna be here long?
I got to mark it
in the logbook.

02:53.049 --> 02:54.505
A few hours.
So,

02:54.592 --> 02:56.423
what’s the story with this guy?

02:56.510 --> 02:59.172
lnitially,
indications were that
he jumped from a bridge,

02:59.263 --> 03:01.174
but since he suffered
a prior heart attack,

03:01.265 --> 03:03.472
and given that he landed
on his back,

03:03.559 --> 03:06.471
the injuries to his right
supraorbital margin—

03:06.604 --> 03:09.767
You know I don’t know
what you’re saying, right?
I’m sorry.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.224
Simply put, it appears
as if he was murdered...

03:13.319 --> 03:16.356
and then thrown from the bridge
to obscure that fact.

03:16.447 --> 03:20.486

I’ll resume my important duties
and go check the bathroom.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.129
That’s not possible, Cam.

embedded in the sternum.

Oh, my God.
Brennan?

23:05.802 --> 23:08.214
Brennan?
Hey, hey, we need—
We need a nurse in here!

23:08.304 --> 23:10.681
Nurse,
we need some help!

23:15.061 --> 23:16.926
Do you remember
the last time
we saw each other?

23:17.021 --> 23:20.388
Of course.
I was 15.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.850
I went to bed,
and I never saw you again.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.988
But I survived.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.357
Of course you did.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.740
We had a fight,
you and l.

23:35.957 --> 23:39.415
We had a fight
the night before
you disappeared.

23:39.544 --> 23:43.162
We fought about a boy.
Scott something, right?

23:43.256 --> 23:45.588
Scott Morrison.

23:45.675 --> 23:48.712
You said that
l was changing myself
too much for him. My clothes—

23:48.803 --> 23:50.885
You started smoking cigarettes
because he did.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.717
I didn’t know
that you knew that.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.925
And I told you that you were
too dreamy and emotional,

23:57.020 --> 24:00.979
making decisions
on what you felt
instead of using your brain.

24:03.318 --> 24:04.808
You did that.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.987
And you
slapped my hand away.

24:10.074 --> 24:13.737
[ Chuckles ]
And then I left, and...

24:15.330 --> 24:17.491
I never saw you again.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.710
I loved you so much.

24:24.797 --> 24:29.541
Oh, honey, I knew that.

24:32.639 --> 24:36.598
I hate that the last thing I did
was slap your hand away.

24:37.852 --> 24:39.683
It’s all right, Temperance.

24:42.190 --> 24:45.728
How do you know?
Maybe that’s why
you took my advice,

24:45.818 --> 24:49.106
and you’d never
change yourself
for another person again—

24:49.197 --> 24:51.313
so you’d never be hurt.

24:53.951 --> 24:58.445
You tucked your heart away,
and you used your brain.

She’s waking up.
Thank God.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.180
Here we go.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.186
Would you
stop scaring us
like that, please?

25:28.277 --> 25:31.644
Sorry, Dad.
Did it throw you for a loop?

25:31.739 --> 25:33.354
[Sighs]

25:33.449 --> 25:34.825
What is it, Max?

25:34.909 --> 25:38.493
[ Stammers ]
Her mother used to
say that to me all the time.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.196
What happened?

25:41.290 --> 25:43.542
You had a reaction to the antigens
in the blood we gave you.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.499
Did you give her
the wrong blood?
No.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.622
We cross—matched her correctly
when we gave her blood during surgery.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.170
That doesn’t make any sense.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.043
Maybe you got it mixed up.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.544
We double—checked
every step of the supply line.

25:52.635 --> 25:55.377
Well, she’s gonna be
all right, isn’t she?

25:55.471 --> 25:58.053
We’re running
some more tests now.

25:58.141 --> 25:59.631
Thank you, Doctor.

Don’t look so worried.

[ Sighs ]

26:10.528 --> 26:13.361
[ Sighs ]
Okay, okay, I’m gonna
get some coffee.

26:13.448 --> 26:15.109
I’ll be back.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.858
Are you okay?
Booth, I—

26:18.953 --> 26:21.239
What is it?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.195
I don’t understand it.

26:23.291 --> 26:26.249
[Sighs]

26:26.335 --> 26:29.668
For some reason,
I feel like it’s you who
keeps calling me back here.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.255
Calling you back from where?

26:33.342 --> 26:34.673
[ Chuckles ]

26:36.179 --> 26:38.135
I went to another place.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.717
My mother is there.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.188
Okay.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.688
Obviously,
l’m hallucinating, so—

26:50.985 --> 26:53.021
No, or she’s helping you.

26:54.781 --> 26:58.148
Look, you came back.
That’s the main thing.

26:58.242 --> 27:02.235
You really think
that I could actually
be seeing my mother?

27:04.248 --> 27:06.364
Yes, I do.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.496
[ Exhales ]

27:10.505 --> 27:12.370
Bones, you okay?

27:14.133 --> 27:16.340
Just want to sleep
for a little while.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.089
Okay. Just—

27:34.862 --> 27:36.523
So that’s an ice bullet.

27:36.656 --> 27:40.774
I’ve run into a myriad of problems
using a traditional brass jacket
and gunpowder.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.325
How many is a “myriad”
of problems?

27:43.412 --> 27:46.245
One— the heat
generated by the ignition
of the gunpowder...

27:46.332 --> 27:48.243
melts the ice bullet
before it can
leave the barrel.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.371
Two— an ice bullet
is only a third
as dense as lead.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.663
it has to move
three times faster
than a normal lead bullet.

27:55.758 --> 27:59.125
So a myriad is a lot.
Sounds impossible.

27:59.220 --> 28:04.089
Well, only if you define
“ice bullet” as frozen water
and a “gun” as a gun.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.764
You ready?

28:12.859 --> 28:15.896
The ice bullet shattered
without even piercing the silicone.

28:15.987 --> 28:18.103
Yes, but what if the shooter
were using a projectile...

28:18.197 --> 28:20.483
that was made of a substance
more dense than ice?

28:20.575 --> 28:23.658
- Then the substance would
leave traces in the body.
- What if it were made of blood?

28:23.744 --> 28:27.532
— A blood bullet?
— Centrifuged red blood cells.

28:27.623 --> 28:31.332
That would explain Dr. Brennan’s
incompatibility reaction.

28:31.419 --> 28:34.081
Yeah. That’s what
gave me the idea.

28:34.171 --> 28:37.379
See, her body reacted
to the blood in the bullet.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.878
Well, how did you get
the blood cells cold enough
to remain stable?

28:39.969 --> 28:44.133
l froze them
in liquid nitrogen.
Ready?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.975
And no exit wound.

28:54.066 --> 28:58.560
So the blood from the bullet melts
and mixes with the victim’s blood.

28:58.654 --> 29:02.613
Nobody ever tests the blood
on the floor of a crime scene
for DNA or other markers.

29:02.700 --> 29:06.192
— They just sweep it away.
— You are— [ Loud Kiss]

29:06.287 --> 29:09.120
- Oh!
- You’re welcome.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.374
I looked at the guard’s
X—rays again.

29:18.466 --> 29:21.629
l was so focused on the shooting
that I didn’t see this.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.383
Right here. A small cranial fracture
on the right side.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.635
I definitely feel something.

29:31.729 --> 29:33.640
Let me shave the hair.

29:33.731 --> 29:36.518
[ Buzzing ]

29:48.120 --> 29:50.281
This injury’s definitely antemortem.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.284
It looks about
five or six days old.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.240
Around the same time
he struggled with Groot.

29:54.335 --> 29:57.702
And it was infected.
We should find out why.

30:03.302 --> 30:07.170
That injury is deep.
Right through the periosteum
to the bone.

30:07.264 --> 30:10.882
Could you collect the pus
and particulates, Dr. Edison?

30:20.361 --> 30:22.226
Oh, yeah, there we go.

30:24.407 --> 30:25.988
Huh.

30:26.075 --> 30:29.033
There’s— There’s some kind
of slivers in there.

30:29.745 --> 30:32.157
Flecks of something shiny.

have a field day.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.502
Where’s Booth?

30:40.589 --> 30:44.002
He got a call from Cam
about the case.

30:44.093 --> 30:46.334
l’m stable,
so I told him to go.

30:46.429 --> 30:47.714
Well, I talked to the doctor.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.136
He said you should be resting.

30:49.265 --> 30:53.304
I’m just examining
my X—rays, Dad.
Which isn’t resting.

30:53.394 --> 30:55.601
Honey,
why don’t you relax?

30:55.688 --> 30:59.272
Let Booth
and the geeks at the lab
take care of this.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.734
Look,
I brought you ice cream.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.980
Hmm. Mint chocolate.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.814
It was your favorite
when you were a kid.

31:08.909 --> 31:13.278
Mom used to get it
at Parkside Candy.
They would pack it by hand.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.073
Booth said you saw her.

31:19.420 --> 31:20.910
Your mother.

31:22.006 --> 31:24.088
The locus coeruleus
in the midbrain...

31:24.175 --> 31:28.168
can release noradrenaline
during highly traumatic events.

31:28.304 --> 31:32.593
It can affect perception.
You were gone
for two minutes.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.054
You went somewhere.
No, Dad.

31:36.145 --> 31:38.477
There’s no other place.

31:41.192 --> 31:42.682
Does she ask about me?

31:45.321 --> 31:46.857
Does she say hi?

31:51.285 --> 31:53.776
In my dream, yes.

31:58.334 --> 31:59.824
She misses you.

32:02.004 --> 32:07.044
[Clicks Tongue]
We were very happy,
all of us, weren’t we?

32:09.595 --> 32:12.132
[ Sighs ]
I miss that so much.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.847
So much.

32:24.819 --> 32:27.561
turned out to be a mixture
of gold paint and wood flakes.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.483
Any idea what that is?
Oh, yeah, of course.

32:30.574 --> 32:33.691
The wood is from an olive tree
grown on Crete.

32:33.828 --> 32:36.069
That’s specific.
Oh, it gets better.

32:36.163 --> 32:39.326
The wood is old.
I mean, carbon dating
tells us 12th century.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.917
And the flecks
are gold paint.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.253
— An artifact of some kind?
— Mm—hmm.

32:43.337 --> 32:45.419
- This is very close to home, isn’t it?
— Very.

32:45.506 --> 32:48.293
I checked the Jeffersonian inventory.
Look at this.

32:48.384 --> 32:51.251
We have a 12th—century Cretan icon
of the Archangel Gabriel...

32:51.345 --> 32:53.961
downstairs in storage,
decorated in gold.

32:54.056 --> 32:57.890
It’s very rare
and very, very valuable.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.467
Booth should know about this.

32:59.562 --> 33:02.304
Have Antiquities check
for any missing artifacts
or forgeries.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.013
Okay.

33:07.069 --> 33:08.684
The guard’s cell phone
records show that...

33:08.779 --> 33:11.612
the last phone call
he placed prior to being shot
was to a burner cell.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.314
Which must have belonged
to the shooter.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.617
Which means the shooter,
the guard and Groot were
all in business together.

33:16.704 --> 33:19.992
The shooter takes out Bones
because he thinks that she’s
the only one smart enough...

33:20.082 --> 33:21.538
to put all the pieces together.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.500
Which means he had
to know Dr. Brennan.
Well, exactly.

33:24.587 --> 33:26.248
Because he works
at the Jeffersonian.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.874
Excuse me?

33:27.965 --> 33:29.956
The guard, he turns off
all the security cameras.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.507
He calls the killer
and tells him that Bones
is working on Groot.

33:32.595 --> 33:34.085
She’s shot within 10 minutes.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.967
That means the shooter was
definitely at the Jeffersonian.

33:38.976 --> 33:43.345
This is the only 12th—century artifact
from Crete at the Jeffersonian.

33:43.439 --> 33:46.977
No one was bashed with this.
There’s no signs
of splintering or impact.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.444
Because this isn’t
the one that Groot used
to crack Hal’s skull.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.941
If you look closely,
youJInoﬂce
a small paintbrush hair.

33:54.116 --> 33:55.697
I ran this
through the mass spec.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.526
It turns out it’s from
a North American squirrel.

33:58.621 --> 34:02.489
Right, I’m guessing there
was no North American squirrels
in 12th-century Crete.

34:02.583 --> 34:05.074
Right. This one’s a fake.
The real one is missing.

34:05.169 --> 34:06.659
And worth a fortune.

34:06.754 --> 34:08.836
All right, so someone stole it,
replaced it with this one.

34:08.923 --> 34:12.666
Had to be Hal.
This was a deal gone bad.

34:14.595 --> 34:17.837
[ Hodgins ]
Dr. Batuhan is the only one capable
of restoring an artifact like that.

34:17.932 --> 34:19.047
Got him?

34:21.644 --> 34:24.477
[ Sparling ]
That’s him, and
he’s got the real icon.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.599
Are you sure you don’t want me
to handle this alone?

34:26.690 --> 34:28.976
What, do you think
I’m too close to this
because he shot Bones?

34:29.068 --> 34:30.649
I can handle it.
That’s all I’m saying.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.647
I would never
jeopardize a conviction,

34:32.738 --> 34:35.445
especially not this one,
all right?

34:35.532 --> 34:37.659
[ Booth ]
Dr. Batuhan.

34:38.452 --> 34:39.441
Hey.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.116
Dr. Batuhan, please step away
from the icon.

34:43.207 --> 34:44.697
Why? What—What’s going on?

34:44.792 --> 34:46.532
lt true that you’re the only person
at the Jeffersonian...

34:46.627 --> 34:50.211
who’s capable of restoring
such beautiful artifacts
like this one?

34:50.297 --> 34:51.958
This is my specialty, yes.

34:52.049 --> 34:55.507
What— Do you have any idea
how valuable that is?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.209
[ Booth ]
As a matter of fact,
we do.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.885
Will someone tell me
what this is about?

34:58.973 --> 35:01.259
Sure. We believe you were
involved in stealing this icon.

35:01.350 --> 35:02.806
And you killed
HalBenneﬂ”.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.600
and then you shot
Dr. Temperance Brennan
in order to hide the theft.

35:05.688 --> 35:08.851
That’s ridiculous.
How can I steal something
which is right here?

35:08.941 --> 35:10.397
The chips from
the guard’s wounds match.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.975
This is definitely the icon
used to hit Hal Bennett.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.560
What, are you trying
to erase the evidence?

35:14.655 --> 35:16.566
[ Sparling ]
We found your forgery
in storage.

35:16.657 --> 35:18.113
I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.784
Why do you have
a cryogenic Dewar,
Dr. Batuhan?

35:21.870 --> 35:24.031
These aren’t usually used
in restoration, are they?

35:24.123 --> 35:26.990
I know my rights.
I don’t have to say
anything else.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.457
[ Hissing ]
Oh, yeah.

35:29.545 --> 35:33.037
This would be perfect
for freezing and storing
blood bullets.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.214
You can’t
go through my things
without a warrant.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.713
Is that right? You know what?
All this belongs to the Jeffersonian.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.589
That’s just an air brush.

35:39.722 --> 35:41.633
Air brush.
This could be
a modified barrel.

35:41.724 --> 35:46.309
Look at that, huh?
Perfect for launching
a frozen projectile, isn’t it?

35:46.395 --> 35:50.434
The compressed air would
give you enough velocity
to penetrate the skin.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.523
It would fit
under a lab coat.

[Air Hisses ]

35:57.406 --> 35:59.362
Looks like you’re gonna
need a lawyer.

has turned up
11 fake artifacts...

36:10.002 --> 36:11.492
in the storage room
of the Jeffersonian.

36:11.587 --> 36:12.576
I’m betting
there’s more.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.377
I didn’t hear
a question.

36:14.465 --> 36:18.959
One of the originals
has already been traced to
a private collector in Munich.

36:19.053 --> 36:21.089
- Again, not a question.
— Interesting fact, though, isn’t it?

36:21.180 --> 36:24.843
Why isn’t there any attending paperwork
for the icon you were restoring?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.310
— Paperwork gets lost all the time.
— Convenient.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.889
This security camera shows you
leaving the restoration room at 8:33...

36:33.984 --> 36:35.485
on the night of the shooting.

36:35.569 --> 36:38.185
Oh, look at that.
What’s that under
your coat there?

36:38.280 --> 36:40.111
Looks like nothing to me.

36:40.199 --> 36:43.817
And here you are
returning at 8:42.

36:43.911 --> 36:46.903
- Where were you
for those nine minutes?
— l was in the washroom.

36:46.997 --> 36:50.615
How many times did you fly
on Groot’s private jets this year?

36:50.709 --> 36:52.290
My client won’t be answering
that question.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.790
Yourjob is to represent him,
not be his accomplice.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.461
- Are you interrogating me now?
- Really?

36:56.548 --> 36:59.039
So the guard gives
the artifacts to Groot.

36:59.134 --> 37:01.546
Groot packs them to avoid customs.

37:01.637 --> 37:04.299
Then you fly with Groot
to authenticate them to the buyers.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.632
You two really don’t understand
the concept of a question, do you?

37:09.019 --> 37:10.225
VVhoa.VVhoa!
You know what?

37:10.354 --> 37:12.640
[ Grunts ]
You tried to kill
the woman I love?

37:12.731 --> 37:13.891
The mother of my child?
Big mistake.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.400
Agent Booth.
Let go of him.

37:15.484 --> 37:18.476
We know what you did in Munich.
We know what you did at the lab.

37:21.365 --> 37:24.482
— You okay?
- Oh, yeah, l’m— I’m fine.

[Cell Phone Beeps]

37:27.371 --> 37:29.783
Unless you want me
to file charges,
we’re done here.

37:29.873 --> 37:32.910
We can hold your client for 24 hours.
According to my watch, I got 15.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.662
And your lawyer sucks.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.580
You can only hold my client
if you have more questions.

37:39.675 --> 37:43.759
Oh, I have questions.

37:43.846 --> 37:45.552
[Thuds ]
l have lots of questions.

37:49.143 --> 37:51.885
— Bones, what’s wrong?
— Nothing. I’m going into surgery.

37:51.979 --> 37:53.185
Those two things
are opposite.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.728
You need evidence
to hold Batuhan.

37:54.857 --> 37:56.893
These two things
aren’t even connected.
Yes, they are.

37:56.984 --> 38:01.478
The projectile pierced
my abdomen and struck
the eighth posterior rib.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.524
It left antigens.
So, what—
Why do you need surgery?

38:03.657 --> 38:06.524
To retrieve the antigens.
So, you’re saying that
Batuhan’s blood is in you?

38:06.618 --> 38:10.156
We’re going to do a biopsy
and test it to see.
Then you’ll have proof.

38:12.374 --> 38:14.330
It’s not dangerous, is it?

38:15.961 --> 38:17.872
It’s 100% risk—free.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.883
- We’re ready, Dr. Brennan.
— All right. Okay.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.266
I’ll be fine.

Oh.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.961
I’m just going to work.
I’ll see you tonight.

39:09.056 --> 39:11.342
Not if I survive the procedure.

39:11.433 --> 39:14.425
This is going to turn out
just like that day.

39:16.230 --> 39:18.437
We’re never going to
see each other again.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.355
We Will.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.276
Of course we will.

39:32.246 --> 39:34.157
The advice
I gave you back then—

39:34.248 --> 39:36.705
use your head,
be rational,

39:36.792 --> 39:38.328
don’t let
your heart lead you,

39:40.420 --> 39:42.331
use your brain.

39:45.259 --> 39:48.126
That allowed you to survive.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.085
And it held true.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.180
But I have another
piece of advice for you.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.849
It’s time for you to find
some of that little girl...

39:59.940 --> 40:02.306
that you locked away
so deep inside yourself.

40:03.485 --> 40:05.601
Why?
Because”.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.984
it’s not about
surviving anymore.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.156
It’s about flourishing.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.535
It’s about living a full life.

40:17.708 --> 40:19.369
If this was real,

40:21.003 --> 40:22.789
I’d tell you I love you.

Easy.

What happened?
Blood matched.

41:36.870 --> 41:39.612
Batuhan was arrested for murder
and attempted murder.

and tell them
that you’re okay.

Nobody knew that.
