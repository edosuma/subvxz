NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.936 --> 00:06.850
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.907 --> 00:08.716
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.775 --> 00:11.654
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.385
These are their stories.

00:14.314 --> 00:15.588
Nice trip, Mr. Grobman?

00:15.649 --> 00:17.822
Too short, Rudy.
Is there any mail?

00:17.885 --> 00:20.263
Oh, yes, sir. And a
package from the court.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.028
Well, make sure my wife gets that
when she comes up from the garage.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.467
Oh, sure thing.

GROBMAN:
Oh, my God! God!

00:30.430 --> 00:32.671
Call 911. Call!

00:33.400 --> 00:35.380
Denise! Denise!

00:36.970 --> 00:38.677
All I saw, Judge
Grobman was wounded,

00:38.739 --> 00:40.241
and that car was
fishtailing out of here.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.116
Brand new Jaguar XJR.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.588
And did you see anybody hangin'
around here before it happened?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.523
Nobody who didn't belong.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.925
She's a nice lady.
She gonna be okay?

00:49.983 --> 00:51.758
I hope so.
Thanks for your help.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.123
Which hospital?
St. Marks.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.133
Husband went with her in the ambulance.
Any witnesses?

00:56.189 --> 00:58.601
Not that we know of. We got the
car info from the doorman,

00:58.659 --> 01:01.139
APB went out maybe seven minutes
after shots were fired.

01:01.194 --> 01:04.766
Okay, thanks. Canvass the tenants and see
if there's anybody we need to talk to.

01:04.831 --> 01:07.607
Victim's Denise Grobman,
civil court judge.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.239
She and her husband have lived
here for nine years and change.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.614
Polite but not chatty.
Husband's an architect.

01:12.673 --> 01:13.743
What do you got?

01:13.807 --> 01:17.084
Victim went down, here. .38's hers.
Two rounds fired.

01:17.144 --> 01:18.953
ED: Civil court judge
needs a gun?

01:19.012 --> 01:20.821
Maybe she hands
out too much alimony.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.189
You find the slugs?

01:22.249 --> 01:24.195
No. Blood over here
can't be hers.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.993
She might've hit him two
out of two, good shooting.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.034
Fair. Good would be
him layin' here dead.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.400
And over here, we have
three cigarette butts.

01:32.459 --> 01:35.531
ED: So, guy waited here
for the first opportunity.

01:35.596 --> 01:39.066
Fuse box is open. Maybe it
was an electrician working.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.805
Maybe. Dust it anyway.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.471
Yeah. No problem.

01:42.536 --> 01:46.006
APB went out quick, if the
car-jacker's got two gunshot wounds,

01:46.073 --> 01:48.212
how far can he get?
I'm feelin' lucky.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.619
Last time I got lucky was 1986.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.623
It's all in the
attitude, Lennie.

All I saw was Denise lying there
bleeding, nothing else registered.

02:48.235 --> 02:50.647
Where were you and
your wife coming from?

02:50.704 --> 02:52.809
We have a cottage
in Sag Harbor.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.352
We'd been there a few days.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.580
Notice anybody followin' you?

02:55.642 --> 02:56.848
No.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.947
Mr. Grobman?
She came through surgery.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.492
We won't have a prognosis
until she stabilizes.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

DANA: Daddy?

03:05.952 --> 03:07.158
What are her injuries?

03:07.220 --> 03:09.461
She took two hits, one
severed her lumbar spine,

03:09.523 --> 03:11.662
the other damaged her kidneys,
we had to remove one of them.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.136
Will we be able to talk to her?

03:13.193 --> 03:15.503
If she lives.
Give me your card.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.209
Thanks.
Thanks.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.074
Uniforms turned up a witness.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.177
He was smokin' a cigarette.

03:23.236 --> 03:26.080
The fuse box was open,
I figure he workin' on it.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.345
What did he look like?

03:27.407 --> 03:29.683
Like a guy who'd be
workin' on a fuse box.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.986
And I don't think this is who
shot the lady and stole her car.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.081
ED: Why not?

03:34.147 --> 03:35.854
Well, if he wanted a car,

03:35.916 --> 03:37.862
he would have taken my
Mercedes, wouldn't he?

03:37.918 --> 03:40.524
I leave the keys
in the ignition.

03:40.587 --> 03:41.759
Why?

03:41.822 --> 03:44.393
Well, I got tired of
spending half my time

03:44.458 --> 03:46.563
trying to remember
where I put them.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.100
Thanks.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.770
If he'd wanted just any car,

03:51.832 --> 03:53.402
he'd have taken
the old man's Mercedes.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.141
So you think Judge Grobman's
Jag was stolen to order.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.876
LaMotte's checking the MO.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.544
Well, hospitals don't have any
unaccounted for gunshot wounds

04:00.607 --> 04:02.018
that match our needs.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.213
Did you get a description?

04:03.276 --> 04:05.085
Witness is in with
the sketch artist.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.249
Here's your possibles.

04:06.313 --> 04:09.419
They specialize in high-end
European cars to order.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.225
So, in other words,
if I wanted an XJR,

04:12.285 --> 04:13.821
and I didn't
want to pay retail...

04:13.887 --> 04:15.161
Call one of these guys.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.928
Check with the
auto theft squad.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.063
These guys have all got DMV
clerks on the payroll.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.504
Hard to catch them.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.770
So the clerk puts the stolen car in the
system under a different VIN number?

04:24.831 --> 04:27.243
Yeah. Well, how do you figure
out which ones are stolen?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.576
By wearin' out
your shoe leather.

04:29.636 --> 04:30.944
Okay.

04:31.872 --> 04:36.912
I'm showin' 14 '99 XJRs
registered since last Thursday.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.447
Two private party sales, which is almost
always how the stolen ones show up.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.084
Well, who sold them?

04:42.149 --> 04:43.890
Seller's gonna be a phony
if the car's hot.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.055
Okay, then, who bought them?

04:47.020 --> 04:51.435
Got a Susan Robbinson,
and a Matthew Carton, MD.

04:51.925 --> 04:55.896
Six, two, four, one.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.407
That's it.
It's the Judge's cars.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.602
Hey.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.076
And we have incoming.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.271
What are you doing?

05:01.334 --> 05:02.472
Dr. Carton?

05:02.536 --> 05:03.913
Who wants to know?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.410
I didn't know it was stolen.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.045
Is this the guy
you bought it from.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.987
No. He was older.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.581
One of these?

05:16.416 --> 05:19.363
You got no record, why do you
wanna do this the hard way?

05:20.287 --> 05:24.167
Nice leather upholstery. Cleans up
pretty good, but not good enough.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.762
What's that mean?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.567
Blood in the seams.
Do you read the papers?

05:27.627 --> 05:29.903
A New York state judge
was shot over this car.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.967
You can probably figure out
what that means for you.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.944
(SIGHS)

05:43.176 --> 05:45.713
I got a hundred thousand
dollar med school debt.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.190
I couldn't afford a
decent car any other way.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.023
How much did you pay for it?

05:50.684 --> 05:51.788
20k.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.995
You could've gotten a perfectly
good, legal car for half that much.

05:56.056 --> 05:59.970
What, a Ford Escort?
I'm a doctor for God's sake.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.002
Which one?

06:06.166 --> 06:08.009
(EXHALES)

06:08.068 --> 06:11.709
Him. Krasner.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.007
I don't know a damn
thing about any judge.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.382
I sell used cars.

06:15.442 --> 06:18.286
Yeah, the trouble is the people who were
using 'em aren't finished with 'em yet.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.882
Attempted murder,
A1 felony, 15-to-life,

06:20.947 --> 06:23.655
or peddling stolen cars, a whole lot less.
Your choice.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.787
Bobby Ward.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.230
He came by middle of last week,

06:28.288 --> 06:31.360
said he had a line on
an XJR, did I want it?

06:31.424 --> 06:33.768
He wanted 5k, I told him three.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.330
Ha. The doctor paid twenty.
Nice profit margin.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.467
How'd Bobby Ward look?

06:38.531 --> 06:39.737
Five-ten, wiry...

06:39.799 --> 06:42.405
No, I mean, was he in
pain, limping, bleeding.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.173
Looked fine to me.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.274
Where can we find him?

06:46.339 --> 06:48.649
Robert Ward.
Police. Open up.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.187
There's nobody home.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.417
Get back. Him and his
girlfriend left this morning.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.959
Get her back.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.051
COP: Police.
Search Warrant.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.461
COP 2: I got him, I got him.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.623
BRISCOE: Ed. In here.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.531
COP 3: Clear!

07:03.590 --> 07:05.797
He's alive, get the paramedics.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.770
One in the arm.
One in the belly.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.535
Looks like the judge
did hit him twice. No gun.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.474
Daniel K. Ward.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.939
Visa receipt in the
name of Arlene Pulaski.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.718
I love it when they're stupid.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.251
What the hell is this, man?

07:23.310 --> 07:24.687
One,

07:26.846 --> 07:27.916
two.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.654
Hey, that's mine.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.024
Must be six,
seven hundred here.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.563
Three grand goes
pretty fast, huh?

07:32.619 --> 07:34.621
Well, well, well, what's this?

07:36.056 --> 07:40.004
Blood. Wow. Probably
10, 15 grand here.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.437
Where'd you get it, Bobby?

07:41.494 --> 07:42.768
Bite me.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.467
Go ahead, bite him.

07:46.232 --> 07:49.111
I didn't steal the car.
I didn't shoot no judge.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.477
Look, I wasn't even there.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.676
You sold the car to Krasner.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.616
He thought it was
his cousin's car!

07:54.674 --> 07:56.779
Hey, the gun we took off
of you's at the lab.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.789
If it turns out it's the
one that shot the judge,

07:58.845 --> 08:00.256
it's bye-bye, Bobby.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.486
I told you,
it's my cousin's gun.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.495
The cousin you left to die.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.087
Hey, I was gonna call that in,

08:06.152 --> 08:07.722
you know, when
I got out of state.

08:07.787 --> 08:10.028
Not that you asked,
but he's in surgery.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.798
Your story better match the one
he tells when he comes to.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.396
Where'd the bloody
14 grand come from?

08:22.068 --> 08:23.809
Possession and sale
of stolen property.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.043
No charges on the shooting
or the car theft.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.280
That's up to the D.A., you can
take your chances if you want.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.018
All right.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.760
Danny said he has
a line on an XJR,

08:37.817 --> 08:40.263
I told him I got experience,
he should let me rip it.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.731
He said, no,
it's a piece of cake,

08:41.788 --> 08:43.789
he just wanted me
to help him turn it over.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.131
So you talked to Krasner.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.365
Yeah, Krasner tops
out at 3 grand.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.201
Danny said that's okay 'cause
he got something in the works

08:51.264 --> 08:52.538
that's worth like,
10 times that.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.873
ED: What was in the works?

08:53.933 --> 08:55.276
He wouldn't tell me.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.281
Ten times three is 30,000.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.044
We took almost 15 off of you,

08:59.105 --> 09:00.175
where's the rest of it?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.378
That's all he had on him.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.977
What? You ripped
a guy off for 15 grand

09:03.043 --> 09:05.489
and you didn't even ask
him where rest of it was?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.286
Yeah. He said
he didn't have it yet.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.690
Look, you want more than that,

09:08.748 --> 09:10.557
you're gonna have
to talk to Danny.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.129
We got a situation.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.963
Looks like that big wad of money
was some kind of down payment.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.400
Half up front, half later.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.528
Murder for hire?

09:19.592 --> 09:20.662
Well that's what it looks like.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.071
We won't know for sure until
we lean on Cousin Danny.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.767
Well, you're gonna
have to lean pretty far.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.141
He just died on
the operating table.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.740
So we do it the hard way.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.083
Who wanted Judge Grobman dead?

09:36.142 --> 09:39.123
Well, she sat on the criminal
court bench for ten years

09:39.179 --> 09:40.522
before she moved over to civil.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.356
And she'd just accepted a position
at the Justice Department,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.726
Assistant Attorney
General for Civil Rights,

09:45.785 --> 09:47.321
due to move DC next month.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.162
What's the connection
to Danny Ward?

09:49.222 --> 09:52.999
Well, what we've got, Danny Ward
had 14 jobs since high school.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.063
Pizza delivery, air conditioner
repair, pretzel vendor...

09:56.129 --> 09:57.437
I get the idea.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.875
Arrested four times,
penny-ante stuff,

09:59.933 --> 10:02.379
one conviction for disorderly
conduct, probation.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.676
Big step up from there to
carjacking and attempted murder.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.342
The gun we took from Cousin
Bobby shot the judge.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.615
Her gun shot
the late Danny Ward.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.122
It's Danny's blood
on the money.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.516
Okay, that's settled.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.083
Let's move on to who hired him.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.153
Had to be somebody who knew when they
were comin' back from Long Island.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.256
Well, assuming she
didn't hire him herself,

10:21.321 --> 10:23.232
we know one other
person who knew.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.098
Start with him.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.736
I don't know this man.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.773
The name "Danny Ward"
mean anything to you?

10:29.829 --> 10:31.035
No.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.340
Do you really think that somebody
hired him to shoot my wife?

10:34.400 --> 10:37.745
Yeah. Somebody who knew when you
and your wife were comin' back.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.648
But nobody knew
except Denise and me.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.789
Oh, you don't think
that I hired him?

10:44.844 --> 10:46.915
Who else knew when
you'd be coming home?

10:46.980 --> 10:50.257
Well, we came back early, we were
supposed to stay till Sunday.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.421
But Denise's clerk
called Thursday morning.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.726
Something about a meeting
she had to go to on Friday.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.698
So you and the clerk
knew, who else?

10:56.756 --> 10:58.360
Well, nobody that I know of.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.495
You and your wife
get along okay?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.172
Hey, it's our job to ask.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.708
Yeah, well, you're
way off base there.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.766
We've been married
twenty-seven years.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.814
I've given her a painkiller.
You've got two minutes.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.873
We'd like to talk to her alone.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.247
I'm goin' in with you.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.980
No, sir, you're not.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.625
That's him.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.355
You returned fire?

11:25.685 --> 11:26.925
Yes.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.431
I don't remember anything else.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.801
Forgive me, you and your husband
have a good relationship?

11:35.595 --> 11:36.767
Why?

11:36.829 --> 11:39.332
It looks like someone hired
this guy to shoot you.

11:39.399 --> 11:43.779
Not my husband, not possible.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.816
Anybody besides
him and your clerk

11:45.872 --> 11:47.943
who knew you were
comin' back to the city early?

11:49.175 --> 11:50.654
I can't remember.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.748
BRISCOE:
You did the driving?

11:54.280 --> 11:56.157
Walter wanted a nap.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.593
At noon?

11:58.284 --> 11:59.957
Up late.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.659
Why'd he get out before you
drove into the garage?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.402
Not Walter.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.805
Ridiculous.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.933
Please, I need to rest.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.480
ED: Your boss ever
get any threats?

12:19.539 --> 12:20.882
All judges get threats.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.510
The D.A.'s office
checks them out.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.781
They never found
anything serious.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.220
We'd like to check
'em out ourselves.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.621
I'll get you the file.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.193
What time did you
call the judge?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.422
Around 9:30
that morning.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.856
Were there ever any problems
between the judge and her husband?

12:36.122 --> 12:38.363
Uh, he probably wishes
she wouldn't work so hard.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.199
Career comes first, huh?

12:40.727 --> 12:43.537
A tie for first.
They're a devoted couple.

12:44.130 --> 12:47.703
Uh, did you tell anybody else
that she was coming back early?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.440
I called her doorman
to tell him

12:49.502 --> 12:51.175
I was messengering
a packet to her.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.342
Documents she needed for
the conference on Friday.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.408
The judge was a plaintiff
in a civil action?

12:56.142 --> 12:58.383
Judge Grobman's president
of a co-op board,

12:58.444 --> 13:00.549
they sued their management
company a couple of years ago,

13:00.613 --> 13:01.990
Marleton Realty.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.152
ED: What for?

13:03.216 --> 13:06.095
They were extorting kickbacks from
subcontractors and service companies.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.222
They get ugly?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.268
Extremely. The head of
Marleton is not a nice man.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.532
Greg Torino?

13:12.592 --> 13:13.832
Yes.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.373
Torino even found a way to put the
bite on other companies' delivery men.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.137
This avenue look promising?

13:19.198 --> 13:20.905
Torino's a real piece of work.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.210
Judge Grobman ripped him to shreds
and almost put him out of business.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.046
Where's that list
of Danny Ward's jobs?

13:32.211 --> 13:34.623
He worked briefly for
All-Kool Heating and Air.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.685
Guess who did maintenance and repairs
for Judge Grobman's building.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.888
All-Kool.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.192
There's the dot that connects
Torino to Danny Ward.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.461
It doesn't explain how
Torino could've known

13:43.523 --> 13:44.831
the Grobmans were
coming home early.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.831
The doorman.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.372
The judge's clerk
told the doorman.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.567
And he probably knows
people at Marleton.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.207
I didn't have a damn
thing to with it.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.407
I didn't tell anybody the
Grobmans were coming back early.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.973
It's a straight line from you,
to Torino, to the shooter.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.518
I got nothing to do
with Torino!

14:01.574 --> 14:03.144
I'm the one who blew the
whistle on him to the board.

14:03.209 --> 14:05.280
Who got All-Kool
this contract. Torino?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.689
They were already here when
Torino took over management.

14:07.747 --> 14:08.953
They don't owe him anything.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.189
And Torino put the bite on
everybody except All-Kool?

14:12.251 --> 14:13.525
That's what I'm saying.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.623
We're gonna leave Officer Johnson
here to keep you company

14:15.688 --> 14:17.326
while we check on some things.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.664
You can't leave a cop here.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.136
It'll tone up the place.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.540
Danny Ward didn't do any residential
work, strictly commercial.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.442
Here.
Here's his job list.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.538
There's no Torino
on any of these jobs?

14:30.603 --> 14:31.775
No.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.545
I'd like to help you
nail that son of a bitch

14:33.606 --> 14:35.950
but I don't see how he and Danny
could have crossed paths.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.488
How'd you get the maintenance
contract to Judge Grobman's building?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.455
No idea.
I was a crew foreman then.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.890
The owner back
then must've known,

14:41.948 --> 14:43.052
but he's dead.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.151
Would it be in those files?

14:44.217 --> 14:45.457
Maybe.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.960
Yeah, we got recommended off a job
we did at a Queens mini-mall.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.559
Can you look up that job?

14:54.927 --> 14:56.270
Ha. Here you go.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.179
Well, well. Look who
designed the mini-mall.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.839
Walter Grobman.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.974
Did Danny Ward work
on this project?

15:06.039 --> 15:07.143
Yeah. I remember.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.085
The design firm had a bad experience
with another cooling company

15:10.143 --> 15:11.451
and they were all over Danny

15:11.511 --> 15:13.718
to make sure this
job got done right.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.725
Thanks for coming in,
Mr. Grobman,

15:16.783 --> 15:18.558
we know things
are tough right now.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.120
Anything I can do.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.097
Well, obviously we're
tryin' to tie the shooter

15:22.155 --> 15:24.635
to someone who had a
grudge against your wife.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.628
Well, I don't see
how I can help you there.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.866
Well, we just wanted
to make sure, now,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.705
you said you'd never seen
this man, Danny Ward, before.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.711
Is that right?
Yes.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.178
You sure about that?

15:37.003 --> 15:38.311
Yes, why?

15:38.371 --> 15:41.113
Because two years ago,
you worked closely with him

15:41.174 --> 15:43.586
during the construction of
the Crosstown mini-mall.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.850
He installed the
heat and the air.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.487
No, no. Not this guy.
That guy was heavier.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.551
Well, this picture was
taken two years ago.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.494
His cousin says
it's a good likeness.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.532
Nah, I'm sorry,
I don't recognize him.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.226
Why don't you
recognize the name?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.631
Well, I never knew
his last name.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.933
BRISCOE: (SIGHS)
The owner of All-Kool

16:01.994 --> 16:05.373
says you left instructions
for Danny almost every day,

16:05.431 --> 16:08.571
in envelopes with "Danny
Ward" written on them.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.205
Well, you know,
it was two years ago.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.147
Why was your wife
drivin' on Thursday?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.583
Because she wanted to.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.678
She said you asked her to drive
so you could take a nap.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.450
Oh. Maybe I did.
I don't remember.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.651
Do you remember why you got
out at the front entrance

16:21.714 --> 16:23.887
instead of going into
the garage with her?

16:23.950 --> 16:25.395
Look, I didn't hire anybody.

16:25.451 --> 16:28.193
Mr. Grobman,
we talked to your doorman.

16:28.254 --> 16:31.326
You and your wife went to your
cottage 10, 12 times a year,

16:31.390 --> 16:34.599
this was the first time you ever
got out in front of the building.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.606
Yeah. We went to the market.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.869
We had grocery bags
plus suitcases,

16:38.931 --> 16:40.569
why not let the doorman help?

16:40.633 --> 16:42.135
That your idea or your wife's?

16:42.201 --> 16:44.272
Keep in mind
we're gonna ask her, too.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.216
Look, My wife is lying in the
hospital in excruciating pain,

16:47.273 --> 16:49.184
and you're accusing
me of puttin' her there.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.244
I don't have to listen
to any more of this.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.187
ED: We were thinking that
this was just a coincidence,

16:53.246 --> 16:55.021
but you're doing
a lousy job explaining it.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.322
I don't have to explain anything.
Now get out of my way!

16:57.383 --> 16:58.623
Ed, Ed.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.824
Mr. Grobman, you sure you
don't want to clear this up?

17:01.888 --> 17:05.836
Excuse me, but I am on my way to
visit my wife in the hospital!

17:05.892 --> 17:08.338
You're not going near her. You're
under arrest for attempted murder.

17:08.394 --> 17:09.667
(SCOFFS)

17:14.133 --> 17:15.942
The People ask the
defendant be remanded.

17:16.002 --> 17:19.006
My client's wife is in the hospital
unable to care for herself,

17:19.070 --> 17:20.948
Mr. Grobman needs
to be with her.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.453
She's there because the defendant
tried to have her killed.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.614
He shouldn't be
allowed near her.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.249
This is an affidavit from
Judge Denise Grobman,

17:28.314 --> 17:29.622
the victim in the case.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.219
She gives him an alibi,
Your Honor.

17:32.318 --> 17:35.458
"Walter was with me when I learned
we had to return to the city early"

17:35.521 --> 17:38.161
"and he was with me
continuously thereafter."

17:38.224 --> 17:41.000
"He had no opportunity
to arrange the incident."

17:41.060 --> 17:43.438
In other words,
the D.A. has no case.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.271
We ask that the
defendant be ROR'd.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.778
Ms. Carmichael?
One million dollars.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.643
That's ridiculous.
My client can't raise that.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.239
He's a successful
architect, Your Honor.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.875
He's not Frank Gehry.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.544
Most of the Grobman money
is tied up in trusts

17:56.609 --> 17:58.213
from Mrs. Grobman's family.

17:58.277 --> 18:01.520
What is accessible is earmarked
for his wife's care.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.391
Bail is set at $25000 dollars.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.761
Did you read my affidavit,
Ms. Carmichael?

18:15.828 --> 18:17.307
Yes.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.867
Do you grasp the meaning
of the word continuously?

18:21.901 --> 18:25.178
He was never out of your
sight, your hearing?

18:25.238 --> 18:28.879
No. Now, I'd like
to be with my family.

18:32.178 --> 18:35.387
You understand your husband
knew the man who shot you.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.621
He lied about why you
were behind the wheel.

18:37.683 --> 18:40.220
You call that evidence?
My God.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.256
Whoever arranged this shooting

18:42.321 --> 18:45.393
was someone who knew you were
coming back to the city early.

18:47.126 --> 18:51.802
I realize that you are doing your
job, but please, it's absurd

18:52.265 --> 18:54.575
and if you insist on
prosecuting my husband,

18:54.634 --> 18:56.841
I will testify on his behalf!

19:02.008 --> 19:04.614
I want you to leave
my parents alone.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.157
Your father knew Danny Ward
and lied about it.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.522
He made a mistake.

19:09.582 --> 19:13.325
Look, you have no idea what these
past two weeks have been like.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.366
My parents have a good marriage

19:15.421 --> 19:18.095
and my father did not do this.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.501
Hey. You guys. Hey.

19:20.559 --> 19:23.369
Hi, Dad. Okay, now remember,
we have to be quiet.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.909
Grandma wants to see you,
but she doesn't feel good.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.780
Why didn't you ask Judge
Grobman about the alibi

19:30.836 --> 19:32.713
before you arrested
her husband?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.308
VAN BUREN: My detectives
didn't want him loose.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.819
You want it on your head if
he kills her in the hospital?

19:36.876 --> 19:38.913
The Grobmans left Sag Harbor

19:38.978 --> 19:41.219
shortly after the judge
heard from her clerk.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.487
How did Mr. Grobman
get it arranged so fast?

19:43.549 --> 19:46.655
Well, he probably already had
it arranged for Sunday night,

19:46.719 --> 19:49.131
that's when they were originally
scheduled to come home.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.429
One phone call to
rearrange the hit.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.935
You have phone records
from their cottage?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.062
We're on it.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.232
JACK: Now the judge has set low bail you're
right back where you didn't want to be.

19:57.296 --> 20:00.004
I doubt that. He'd have to
be an idiot to kill her now.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.740
So the arrest was pre-emptive?
Come on, Lieutenant.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.179
What's the problem?

20:04.236 --> 20:08.184
This man hired someone
to blast his wife.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.277
And I'll be glad to nail
his hide to the wall.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.413
If he did it.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.151
If you bring me
a case. Fast.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.794
We pulled the IUDs from the phone at the
cottage and both their cell phones.

20:22.855 --> 20:26.064
Nothin' that day on the cells and
only one call from the cottage.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.195
Who to?

20:27.259 --> 20:31.036
Listed under a D. Van Horn,
11:17 a.m., Sag Harbor.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.900
An hour and a half after the
clerk left the message.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.308
Well, maybe Grobman
called D. Van Horn,

20:36.369 --> 20:38.371
and D. Van Horn
called Danny Ward.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.576
Yeah, we should be so lucky.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.475
VAN HORN: It was
just after 11:15.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.179
I just got back from the market

20:44.243 --> 20:46.314
but Walter didn't
call Denise did.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.585
What did she want?

20:47.646 --> 20:49.523
Oh, to apologize for
last minute regrets.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.290
They were supposed to stop by
for drinks that afternoon.

20:52.351 --> 20:56.197
Denise said it was an office thing.
She just found out.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.825
Just then, at 11:15?

20:57.890 --> 20:59.961
Yes she had a message
from her clerk.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.562
I can't believe Walter had
anything to do with this.

21:02.628 --> 21:03.732
Why is that?

21:03.796 --> 21:05.400
Ah. It just doesn't track.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.466
I've known Denise
her whole life

21:07.533 --> 21:09.479
and Walter for
damn near 30 years.

21:09.535 --> 21:12.277
Ever since he came back
from California with her.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.477
I mean they're the golden
couple that everybody envies.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.984
There are no problems
between them?

21:17.042 --> 21:18.180
Well, they're not saints

21:18.244 --> 21:21.350
and they both have stressful
careers, but nothing major.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.485
What does "they're
not saints" mean?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.853
Walter wasn't thrilled about the
Justice Department appointment.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.490
He didn't want to move
to DC, but who would?

21:30.089 --> 21:32.695
Couldn't he design buildings
from pretty much anywhere?

21:32.758 --> 21:35.932
I guess, but I think lately he's
been tired of playing tag-along.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.235
How so?

21:37.863 --> 21:40.503
We had a little reception
about a month ago

21:40.566 --> 21:42.443
to celebrate
Denise's appointment

21:42.501 --> 21:46.972
and Walter was introducing himself
as Mr. Judge Denise Grobman.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.353
You said you went to
the market in Sag Harbor.

21:50.409 --> 21:51.410
Yes.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.013
Did you see
Mr. Grobman in town?

21:53.078 --> 21:55.922
No. But I drove past their
house on the way back

21:55.981 --> 21:59.952
and Walter was in the side yard running
water from the hose over his head.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.362
I guess he'd been jogging.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.694
Why do you say that?

22:02.755 --> 22:05.361
He had his jogging clothes on.
He runs every day.

22:05.424 --> 22:07.335
Took it up a couple
of months ago.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.999
CARMICHAEL: Judge Grobman
swore in her affidavit

22:12.064 --> 22:14.374
he never left the house
at all that morning.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.073
If he heard the message
come through earlier...

22:17.136 --> 22:20.345
You think he went jogging and
called Danny Ward along the way.

22:20.406 --> 22:23.683
Briscoe and Green are pulling IUDs
on pay phones he would've passed.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.621
You run across anything
that smells like a motive?

22:26.679 --> 22:30.627
As far as the cops can tell Grobman
didn't gamble, he didn't play the field.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.527
The insurance money and her
estate go to the grandkids.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.490
Still looking.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.441
No, I don't think
he tried to kill her.

22:44.497 --> 22:47.137
But yes, I am breaking
off our partnership.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.906
You mind if I ask why?

22:48.968 --> 22:50.538
Walter's a really
good architect

22:50.603 --> 22:52.378
but you have to consider
the client's needs,

22:52.438 --> 22:55.282
and he's just not willing
to do that anymore.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.014
Well, isn't that
part of the job?

22:57.076 --> 22:58.419
Thank you.

22:58.477 --> 23:03.187
Client wants Colonial, Walter gives him
50 reasons why it should be Bauhaus.

23:03.249 --> 23:06.822
Won't take no for an answer,
client goes someplace else.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.627
So do I, finally.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.964
That's the Prager Prize, the
Nobel Prize of architecture.

23:12.024 --> 23:15.164
Walter won it as part of a team
when he was starting out in LA.

23:16.295 --> 23:17.774
That was 25 years ago.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.400
Walter was a prodigy.

23:19.465 --> 23:21.274
He never lived up
to expectations?

23:21.333 --> 23:23.870
It's hard when you won't
listen to the client.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.813
He's a great guy
in a lot of ways,

23:25.871 --> 23:27.282
it's just that he,
I don't know,

23:27.339 --> 23:28.682
he needs to be right
all the time.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.652
Is that part of his
relationship with his wife?

23:31.710 --> 23:33.587
It's part of who he is.

23:33.646 --> 23:36.217
She never had a problem
with it that I could see.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.592
He had free rein on their
new country house.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.621
What new country house?

23:40.686 --> 23:43.064
They bought 20 acres
in Dutchess County.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.659
Walter was going to design
their dream house.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.898
How many country houses
do they need?

23:47.960 --> 23:50.270
The one in Sag Harbor's
Denise's, from her father.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.865
This one was gonna be theirs.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.001
Was?

23:53.065 --> 23:54.169
He gave it up.

23:54.233 --> 23:58.045
Denise's job at the Justice Department?
Eight days a week.

23:58.103 --> 24:01.676
Walter said, what good's a
dream house with nobody in it?

24:02.775 --> 24:05.756
Twenty-five years ago, he was an
award-winning young architect,

24:05.811 --> 24:07.916
she was scrambling
to pay her student loans.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.982
Now the shoe's
on the other foot.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.653
He suddenly just had enough?

24:12.284 --> 24:15.322
The co-op's in her name,
the cottage is in her name,

24:15.387 --> 24:18.095
his net income last year
was half what she made.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.398
Where'd he get the money
to pay Danny Ward?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.940
He put a $20,000 deposit
on the land upstate

24:23.996 --> 24:25.771
and got it back when
they changed their minds.

24:25.831 --> 24:26.866
(PHONE RINGING)

24:26.932 --> 24:28.605
And it was
never re-deposited?

24:28.667 --> 24:30.806
Not in any of their accounts.

24:31.837 --> 24:35.080
Carmichael.
You're sure?

24:36.942 --> 24:38.319
Thanks, Lennie.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.053
Bingo.

24:42.047 --> 24:44.857
Your clerk left
a message at 9:30.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.659
Mr. McCoy, this is
all the same nonsense.

24:47.987 --> 24:53.630
At 10:14, a call was made from
a pay phone in Sag Harbor.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.536
A call to Daniel Ward,

24:56.595 --> 24:58.233
the man who shot you.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.172
Are you sure?
CARMICHAEL: Yes.

25:00.866 --> 25:04.006
At 11:00, your neighbor saw
your father in the yard

25:04.069 --> 25:07.573
in his jogging clothes, cooling
himself off with the hose.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.284
Tell the nurse I need Demerol.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.446
Now, Dana.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.627
You have a witness who
saw him use the phone?

25:17.683 --> 25:18.684
Not yet.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.753
His prints on the keypad?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.389
We're running them now.

25:23.656 --> 25:24.964
Isn't it obvious what happened?

25:25.024 --> 25:27.698
Someone was watching us, that
person called Daniel Ward.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.673
How did that person know you were
going back to the city early?

25:30.729 --> 25:32.902
I don't want
to hear this. I can't.

25:36.835 --> 25:40.749
Walter did not do this.
It's not possible.

25:48.147 --> 25:51.151
Briscoe and Green have talked to
practically everyone in Sag Harbor,

25:51.216 --> 25:52.957
no one saw Grobman
use the pay phone.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.964
Anybody see him jogging?

25:55.020 --> 25:59.765
About a dozen, but no one can
remember what time or which day.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.429
And there's nothing
in Forensics?

26:01.493 --> 26:02.767
No smoking gun.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.240
As long as his wife's giving him an
alibi, this isn't going anywhere.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.174
(PHONE RINGING)

26:07.866 --> 26:09.504
Carmichael.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.876
Yes.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.715
(SIGHING) Thank you.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.417
Judge Grobman filed an application
to terminate her treatment.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.490
Her dialysis?

26:23.549 --> 26:25.187
She wants to die.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.726
Bad time for
an irrevocable decision.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.270
Anytime's bad.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.637
It's her life, only she can
decide if it's worth living.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.608
I'm not sure
it should be up to her.

26:40.666 --> 26:43.613
ADAM: Up to the proper court
to consider her application.

26:43.669 --> 26:44.807
Even then.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.043
You have a moral objection?

26:47.105 --> 26:48.607
Yeah, I do.

26:48.674 --> 26:51.518
CARMICHAEL: Have you forgotten
your professional obligation?

26:51.577 --> 26:55.787
If for whatever reason she's not around
to testify on her husband's behalf...

26:55.848 --> 26:57.418
That's pretty damn callous.

26:57.483 --> 27:00.293
It's a civil matter,
anyway we have no standing.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.763
We do now.

27:02.988 --> 27:05.901
Mr. Grobman's
filed for a TRO

27:05.958 --> 27:08.564
to block his wife's application
to terminate treatment.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.004
Quick work.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.372
JUDGE PONGRACIC:
You want me to grant a TRO

27:15.434 --> 27:17.812
to stop Judge Grobman
from terminating dialysis?

27:17.870 --> 27:19.213
In effect, her life.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.080
Yeah, so she can
testify for your client.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.380
Isn't this a civil
matter, Counselor?

27:22.441 --> 27:23.681
She's a witness, Judge.

27:23.742 --> 27:26.848
You can preclude her from taking
any action until after the trial.

27:26.912 --> 27:27.982
That could take months.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.788
In the meantime, my clients
spends every minute of every day

27:30.849 --> 27:32.260
in unendurable pain.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.354
I saw Mrs. Grobman on
Wednesday, Your Honor,

27:34.419 --> 27:36.126
she's coping with her pain.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.667
What, you're siding
with the defense on this?

27:37.723 --> 27:40.966
Your Honor, this should be decided
based on what is best for my client.

27:41.026 --> 27:43.370
Somebody else's
jurisdiction, Mr. Brizard.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.603
Mine is protecting the integrity
of the trial process.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.112
Her testimony is absolutely
crucial to my client's defense.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.149
In that case,
I'm gonna grant the TRO.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.207
My client has asked me
to propose an alternative.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.651
Her testimony
could be taken now,

27:57.709 --> 27:59.484
preserved on videotape
for the jury.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.486
Any objection?

28:07.419 --> 28:09.126
If we can tape her testimony

28:09.188 --> 28:11.361
we'll withdraw the
application for the TRO.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.233
You don't give a damn about
anything but her testimony.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.671
Your Honor, this is giving
him exactly what he wants.

28:16.728 --> 28:18.730
His wife dies and
he gets away it.

28:18.797 --> 28:21.277
That's enough, Ms. Carmichael.
Mr. McCoy?

28:21.333 --> 28:23.973
Your Honor, the D.A.'s
office has concluded that

28:24.036 --> 28:27.483
Judge Grobman was mistaken
in her affidavit.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.213
I'd welcome the chance
to cross examine her.

28:30.275 --> 28:33.017
Are you saying she perjured herself?
Denise Grobman?

28:33.078 --> 28:34.955
The word I used was mistaken.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.285
This is an
inconceivable situation.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.092
Denise is a friend
and a colleague.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.225
But if her testimony is exculpatory,
I don't have much choice.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.668
Application for TRO is moot.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.468
Witness to be examined at the
earliest possible moment.

28:53.499 --> 28:57.276
My husband never left
the cottage that morning.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.782
He didn't go for a run.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.715
CLAYMORE: Where was he?

29:01.773 --> 29:04.515
Part of the time he was
in the yard with me,

29:04.576 --> 29:07.853
and he spent an hour so
going over blueprints.

29:08.814 --> 29:09.986
Where?

29:10.048 --> 29:12.358
In the garage,
there's a studio.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.827
Would you have
known if he had left?

29:15.888 --> 29:17.128
Yes.

29:18.223 --> 29:21.397
Is the telephone answering
machine in the garage?

29:21.460 --> 29:23.098
No, in the house.

29:24.229 --> 29:26.869
Thank you.
No further questions.

29:30.002 --> 29:35.475
Can you explain why your husband
was in the yard at 11:00,

29:35.541 --> 29:39.148
in jogging clothes, running
water over his head?

29:39.211 --> 29:41.122
It was a hot day,

29:41.179 --> 29:43.955
and he lives in his jogging clothes
when we're at the cottage.

29:44.016 --> 29:48.192
He worked up a sweat
going over blueprints?

29:48.253 --> 29:49.857
DENISE: I guess so.

29:49.921 --> 29:53.630
And he was so exhausted from
looking at these blueprints,

29:53.692 --> 29:57.970
that he needed to take a nap
in the car while you drove?

29:58.030 --> 29:59.737
He was tired, yes.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.106
At noon?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.272
Yes.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.642
I want to remind you,
Judge Grobman

30:06.705 --> 30:10.346
that you not only took an
oath today to tell the truth,

30:10.409 --> 30:14.482
you also took an oath 12 years ago
when you were sworn in as a judge...

30:14.546 --> 30:15.718
Your Honor!

30:15.781 --> 30:17.522
...to uphold the
laws of this state...

30:17.582 --> 30:19.027
Walter did not do this.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.223
...and the rules
of the court.

30:21.286 --> 30:23.732
I'm tired, I'm in pain.

30:23.789 --> 30:26.633
No matter how many different
ways he approaches the question,

30:26.692 --> 30:28.330
the answer is the same.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.103
My husband did not
arrange the shooting.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.770
He had no motive,
he had no opportunity.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.336
Why are you protecting him,
Judge Grobman? You know he...

30:37.402 --> 30:38.881
JUDGE PONGRACIC:
That's enough, Mr. McCoy.

30:38.937 --> 30:41.679
Your cross-examination
is over.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.384
The witness is excused.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.388
So I expect you'll
dismiss the charges now.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.127
Not a chance.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.294
You're gonna drag this out?

30:59.992 --> 31:02.632
You don't give a damn
about this family, do you?

31:03.228 --> 31:06.505
My motion to dismiss will be
on your desk in the morning.

31:08.433 --> 31:09.776
Now what?

31:09.835 --> 31:12.372
If she dies before we can shake
her loose from her lies...

31:12.437 --> 31:13.541
Why is she doing this?

31:13.605 --> 31:17.280
Why is she covering for the man who
turned her life into a living hell?

31:20.979 --> 31:23.084
Of course she
knows, Mr. McCoy.

31:23.148 --> 31:27.528
We both know that
my dad tried to kill her.

31:28.754 --> 31:31.257
Did she tell you that she knew?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.999
No.

31:36.061 --> 31:40.066
She won't even admit it
to herself but I can tell.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.544
If she knows,
why's she covering for him?

31:43.468 --> 31:45.345
Guilt.
Guilt?

31:45.670 --> 31:47.775
She can't take back who she is.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.887
I'm sorry,
I'm not following you.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.219
My mom's career
always came first.

31:54.279 --> 31:58.523
And I don't mean that she neglected
being a wife and a mother,

31:58.583 --> 32:01.587
she just never realized
how my dad felt.

32:02.387 --> 32:05.061
See, she was more
successful then he was,

32:05.123 --> 32:06.602
she kept moving up

32:07.793 --> 32:10.103
and he just treads water.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.835
They argued about it?

32:13.131 --> 32:18.410
He would shout that he gave up his
dreams to move east with her,

32:19.504 --> 32:22.075
that she had it all
and he had nothing.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.211
JACK: What was your
mother's reaction?

32:24.276 --> 32:27.120
Well, she thought that they
supposed to be partners,

32:27.179 --> 32:29.659
that what was good for one,
was good for both.

32:30.882 --> 32:32.884
She didn't see a problem.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.800
Do you want your father
to be held accountable?

32:41.026 --> 32:43.666
You think your mother might
change her mind about facing it?

32:43.728 --> 32:47.972
Isn't it obvious that she would
rather die than face it?

32:50.168 --> 32:52.341
If she dies, it's over.

32:55.340 --> 32:59.482
I've tried so hard to talk
her out of wanting to die.

32:59.544 --> 33:03.458
She still has her mind, and
she has people who love her.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.525
She's so depressed that
she can't think straight.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.934
Would you be willing to sign
an affidavit about that?

33:22.868 --> 33:24.074
Yes.

33:26.771 --> 33:30.548
You're challenging Judge Grobman's
competency as a witness on what grounds?

33:30.609 --> 33:34.318
I have an affidavit from the Grobman's
daughter stating that her mother

33:34.379 --> 33:36.381
is too depressed
to think rationally.

33:36.448 --> 33:39.327
Is she qualified to diagnose
her mother's emotional state?

33:39.384 --> 33:41.193
Our psychiatrist,
Dr. Skoda, is.

33:41.253 --> 33:44.598
Your Honor, if you rule that my
client isn't competent to testify,

33:44.656 --> 33:47.660
you collaterally damage her
application to terminate her life.

33:47.726 --> 33:48.864
Not necessarily.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.338
Already the State
Attorney General

33:50.395 --> 33:53.467
and the hospital are contesting
my client's application.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.911
Any ruling that puts her competency
in question weakens our position.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.915
My only concern can be this
criminal case, I'm sorry.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.781
You have my permission
for Dr. Skoda to examine her.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.147
DR. SKODA: It's not
irrational to want to die?

34:09.281 --> 34:11.022
Not if you're
in this condition.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.326
Your condition is new.

34:15.152 --> 34:16.757
How do know you won't
change your mind?

34:18.757 --> 34:21.567
I'm not interested in
any more questions.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.475
If you don't convince me
your decision is rational,

34:25.530 --> 34:27.668
you may lose control
over your situation.

34:28.967 --> 34:30.071
Look at me.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.510
I'm not even in control
of my bowels.

34:35.607 --> 34:38.985
Can't you people leave
me alone, let me die?

34:40.277 --> 34:43.088
I'm in pain every
minute of every day.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.692
I've spoken with your doctors,

34:45.750 --> 34:47.422
they say the pain is treatable.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.726
It's all treatable.

34:50.487 --> 34:51.762
A catheter,

34:52.757 --> 34:54.634
a colostomy bag,

34:54.693 --> 34:56.331
a dialysis machine,

34:57.295 --> 35:00.538
a wheelchair,
a physical therapist,

35:01.199 --> 35:03.270
a lifetime supply of Demerol.

35:04.669 --> 35:06.342
Would you want that?

35:12.310 --> 35:14.017
Will your husband
take care of you?

35:15.914 --> 35:17.291
Yes.

35:19.251 --> 35:22.323
I know people who are
paraplegic, even quadriplegic,

35:22.387 --> 35:24.389
who lead vital,
productive lives.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.467
Would you like to meet them?

35:29.094 --> 35:30.664
I'm tired.

35:32.831 --> 35:35.812
Can't you people
just leave me alone?

35:37.102 --> 35:39.139
Can't you let me die?

35:46.812 --> 35:48.314
Is it her physical condition

35:48.380 --> 35:50.860
or her mental state
that's driving her?

35:50.916 --> 35:52.327
I can't give
a clean answer to that.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.125
They're feeding off each other.

35:54.186 --> 35:55.665
Is she competent?

35:55.720 --> 35:59.463
She's overwhelmed,
depressed, confused.

35:59.524 --> 36:01.197
Is that a no?

36:03.128 --> 36:04.471
My opinion,

36:04.529 --> 36:07.373
she's not capable of making a
rational decision right now.

36:07.465 --> 36:09.138
So we make it for her.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.576
Riding this into the ground.

36:11.636 --> 36:13.809
At first, I thought the cops
were wrong, they weren't.

36:14.706 --> 36:18.415
Walter Grobman hired
someone to kill his wife,

36:18.476 --> 36:20.319
because he felt eclipsed.

36:21.146 --> 36:23.217
He's destroyed her life
for no good reason.

36:23.281 --> 36:26.888
Why she's shielding him,
I will never understand.

36:26.952 --> 36:30.866
But I know my job, I'm gonna convict
this narcissistic son of a bitch.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.162
What about her?

36:32.223 --> 36:34.931
Her life is over
whether she dies or not.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.974
His conviction is the only thing
we can salvage out of this mess.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.169
If you have her declared
incompetent to testify,

36:41.232 --> 36:44.213
no civil judge will let
her pull the plug.

36:44.269 --> 36:47.079
Then she'll be alive, not dead.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.708
For a life she doesn't want.

36:48.773 --> 36:51.549
Is this a thing that
you decide for someone else?

36:58.950 --> 37:01.931
She's clinically depressed
and in massive denial.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.763
Her judgment is
impaired by depression,

37:04.823 --> 37:07.804
pain, denial and drugs.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.202
She's suicidal.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.172
Thank you, Dr. Skoda.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.041
If somebody came to you and told you they
were thinking of committing suicide,

37:19.104 --> 37:20.378
you would treat
them wouldn't, you?

37:20.438 --> 37:21.917
Yes. If that's
what they wanted.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.577
Because your
profession considers

37:23.642 --> 37:26.589
suicidal thoughts to be
symptomatic of neurosis?

37:26.645 --> 37:27.817
DR. SKODA: Yes.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.291
Can you foresee
any circumstances

37:30.348 --> 37:34.160
in which a person could make a
rational decision to end their life?

37:35.920 --> 37:38.958
Such decisions are
always made under duress.

37:39.024 --> 37:42.233
Aren't rational decisions
often made under duress?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.434
Yes.
I suppose so.

37:44.930 --> 37:49.811
As a medical doctor, do you
support a patient's right to die?

37:52.337 --> 37:53.975
My personal beliefs...

37:54.039 --> 37:55.712
As a medical doctor.

38:01.246 --> 38:03.226
Then, no. I don't.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.488
Thank you.
No more questions.

38:07.218 --> 38:10.028
Judge Grobman,
are you depressed?

38:10.088 --> 38:13.365
Of course I am,
who wouldn't be?

38:13.425 --> 38:17.066
Can you articulate your reasons for
wanting to terminate your life?

38:18.263 --> 38:20.402
I'm in constant pain,

38:20.465 --> 38:22.570
I'm told it will
never get better.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.445
There's nothing the doctors can
do to give me back my life.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.419
I don't want to live like this.

38:30.875 --> 38:34.982
Does your desire to die spring
from your physical condition,

38:35.046 --> 38:38.721
or from the possibility it was
your husband that did this to you?

38:38.783 --> 38:40.490
From my physical condition.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.632
My husband did nothing.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.695
Thanks.

38:51.362 --> 38:55.674
You do understand that we're not here
to decide your right to die, don't you?

38:55.733 --> 38:57.735
Of course I do, Mr. McCoy.

38:58.403 --> 39:00.713
You want to prove
I'm irrational

39:00.772 --> 39:03.844
so you can preclude my testimony
on behalf of my husband.

39:04.476 --> 39:08.049
You left the hospital three
days ago, is that right?

39:08.112 --> 39:09.182
Yes.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.858
Where are you staying?

39:11.916 --> 39:14.089
With my daughter
and her family.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.825
Why not with your husband?

39:15.887 --> 39:17.924
Because my daughter
lost the coin toss.

39:17.989 --> 39:20.230
Could you be
responsive, please?

39:20.291 --> 39:23.534
My husband has a business to run.
My daughter doesn't.

39:23.595 --> 39:26.667
Do you get nursing care
at your daughter's?

39:27.232 --> 39:28.540
Yes.

39:29.267 --> 39:30.746
Around the clock?

39:30.802 --> 39:32.213
Yes.

39:32.270 --> 39:36.116
Why couldn't they do that
just as well at your house?

39:36.174 --> 39:38.654
My daughter insisted
I stay with her.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.883
Did she say why?

39:44.482 --> 39:45.859
Judge Grobman?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.921
You've convinced her
her father tried to kill me.

39:48.987 --> 39:53.993
Do you understand that your husband
knew the man who shot you?

39:54.492 --> 39:55.493
You say.

39:55.560 --> 40:01.374
Do you understand that your husband
was one of a very few people

40:01.432 --> 40:03.878
who knew that you were coming
back to the city early?

40:03.935 --> 40:05.039
So what?

40:05.103 --> 40:11.384
Do you understand that your
husband made the phone call

40:11.442 --> 40:13.217
that set up the shooting?

40:13.278 --> 40:15.258
I don't know that,
and neither do you.

40:15.313 --> 40:17.020
But you do understand

40:18.249 --> 40:22.925
that your husband
resented for 25 years

40:22.987 --> 40:26.332
your accomplishments,
your success.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.803
We had a good marriage.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.637
Did he say to you,
more than once,

40:33.264 --> 40:37.303
that if he hadn't knuckled
under to what you wanted

40:37.368 --> 40:40.474
he'd have gotten the
recognition that he deserved?

40:40.538 --> 40:42.347
He didn't mean it
the way it sounds.

40:42.407 --> 40:43.579
How did he mean it?

40:43.641 --> 40:46.212
Why do you hammer
and hammer at this?

40:46.277 --> 40:48.553
Can't you see it's my fault?

40:49.781 --> 40:52.591
(CRYING) Please, please
leave Walter alone.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.789
I've loved him for
more than half my life.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.730
Everything is my fault.

41:04.562 --> 41:06.405
When is this over?

41:07.065 --> 41:08.942
When is this over?

41:11.936 --> 41:15.884
Lisa, please make them stop.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.685

(DENISE SOBBING)

41:53.544 --> 41:55.683
JUDGE PONGRACIC: This has been
a difficult decision to make.

41:55.747 --> 41:59.490
I was asked to render an opinion
that affects, however indirectly,

41:59.551 --> 42:02.395
Denise Grobman's control
over her own destiny.

42:03.154 --> 42:07.034
I know my ruling here may well affect
the outcome of her application

42:07.091 --> 42:09.332
for termination
of life support.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.769
I am devastated by
that responsibility.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.204
That being said,

42:18.169 --> 42:20.308
it is the determination
of the court

42:20.371 --> 42:24.319
that Denise Grobman is not
competent to give testimony

42:24.375 --> 42:27.254

Notice of intent to appeal, application
to Judge Pongracic to reconsider.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.560
What goes on inside you
when you look at your wife?

42:42.427 --> 42:44.270
Knowing that
you did it for nothing.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.407
Knowing she'd rather die
than acknowledge it was you.

42:48.466 --> 42:50.412
We're not pleading, Mr. McCoy.

42:51.135 --> 42:53.615
Why the hell didn't
you just divorce her?

42:54.605 --> 42:57.586
Was the wound to your ego
so big that she had to die?

42:59.277 --> 43:00.381
I want it over.

43:00.445 --> 43:02.152

I want it over!

43:04.015 --> 43:07.360
I did it! I did it!
I killed her. I did it!

43:16.360 --> 43:17.998
No, what about my wife?

43:18.062 --> 43:19.939
You have fixed it so that she
can't win her application,

43:19.997 --> 43:22.409
she'll be like...
she'll be like that...

43:22.467 --> 43:23.810
She'll...

43:25.336 --> 43:28.909
Civil court won't get word of Judge
Pongracic's decision for weeks.

43:28.973 --> 43:30.247
It can all be over before then.

43:30.308 --> 43:32.049
We won't oppose
her application.

43:33.778 --> 43:35.985
Knock it down to
attempted murder two.

43:37.248 --> 43:38.386
No.

43:38.483 --> 43:40.963
For God sake, McCoy,
toss us a bone.

43:44.288 --> 43:47.929
In 25 years, when Mr. Grobman
comes up for parole,

43:47.992 --> 43:50.165
the D.A.'s office
won't oppose it.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.314
(EXHALING)

44:09.680 --> 44:12.490
Denise Grobman passed
away an hour ago.

44:16.154 --> 44:17.531
Was her husband with her?

44:18.256 --> 44:19.394
Yes.

44:21.459 --> 44:24.099
I hope he takes that image
with him to prison.
