<i>'cause I was nervous,
clearly,</i>

10:06.079 --> 10:09.285
and I shoulda been being
a boss business woman.

10:09.285 --> 10:11.121
Coryanne,
you'll be giving India

10:11.121 --> 10:12.691
<i>the edgy cool,
street style look.</i>

10:12.691 --> 10:14.095
<i>Whenever
you're ready.</i>

10:14.095 --> 10:17.635
First, we are gonna be
giving her a bold liner.

10:17.635 --> 10:19.772
Smoke and Shine
and little black smokey.

10:19.772 --> 10:23.446
Just a little somethin'
somethin' for "dramatacism."

10:23.446 --> 10:25.551
- ( laughs )
- I don't know if that's a word.

10:25.551 --> 10:27.387
So these products
also use a lot of argan oil

10:27.387 --> 10:29.324
which make them easier to apply
'cause they don't get, like,

10:29.324 --> 10:31.228
- dry and crusty.
- Good to know.

10:31.228 --> 10:34.068
And to finish off the
look, we are gonna be using

10:34.068 --> 10:36.439
Oh, My Gloss!
La La La 500.

10:36.439 --> 10:38.810
- <i>( Rita chuckles )</i>
- All angles.

10:38.810 --> 10:41.281
Coryanne was
really engaging

10:41.281 --> 10:43.285
<i>and she put some
sense of humor in it.</i>

10:43.285 --> 10:44.454
- That makes sense.
- Right, exactly.

10:44.454 --> 10:47.127
Well, you just look smashing.

10:47.127 --> 10:49.966
Tatiana:
<i>Under pressure Coryanne,
she kinda gets nervous</i>

10:49.966 --> 10:52.070
and she doesn't
know when to say things

10:52.070 --> 10:54.274
<i>and when not to say things,
and I feel like it made her
seem</i>

10:54.274 --> 10:56.311
a little less brand ambassador
and professional.

10:56.311 --> 10:58.650
Courtney's gonna get
the bold, punk chic look.

10:58.650 --> 11:00.754
<i>This look, it's very
focused on the eyes,</i>

11:00.754 --> 11:03.492
so we are gonna use
the Magnif'Eyes eyeliner.

11:03.492 --> 11:05.329
And what's really, really good
about this product

11:05.329 --> 11:06.633
is that it has
the point on there

11:06.633 --> 11:09.471
so it gives you that angle
to do an easier cat eye

11:09.471 --> 11:11.442
if you're
not a professional
makeup artist.

11:11.442 --> 11:13.345
Do you do your
friends makeup as well?

11:13.345 --> 11:15.083
- No, I do not.
- You don't?

11:15.083 --> 11:17.487
- It seems like you do makeup.
- Rita: <i>Tatiana is great.</i>

11:17.487 --> 11:20.994
<i>You know, she knew the
product, she sold it well,</i>

11:20.994 --> 11:22.364
<i>but it was
very corporate,</i>

11:22.364 --> 11:25.169
and I just wished it just
was a bit more lifting and fun.

11:25.169 --> 11:26.472
All right,
let's switch it up.

11:26.472 --> 11:28.877
- Okay.
- Rita: Courtney,

11:28.877 --> 11:31.449
<i>you're gonna be giving
Tatiana the classic
sophisticated.</i>

11:31.449 --> 11:34.154
So first,
we have the volume
color is mascara

11:34.154 --> 11:38.664
and this mascara
is actually pretty amazing
because in two weeks,

11:38.664 --> 11:40.367
it actually
tints your lashes.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.003
- Wow.
- That's amazing.

11:42.003 --> 11:43.606
You have very long lashes.

11:43.606 --> 11:47.013
Next, I'm gonna use the To Nude
Or Not To Nude lipstick.

11:47.013 --> 11:50.220
Does that stay on?
Is there a trick to kind
of keeping it on?

11:50.220 --> 11:55.363
- How's it work?
- Well, this is a...

12:00.640 --> 12:02.712
I would say,
"Drink through a straw."

12:02.712 --> 12:05.383
- Okay.
- Courtney: <i>Personally,</i>

12:05.383 --> 12:07.988
I do think that I can
represent Rimmel better.

12:07.988 --> 12:12.097
<i>I'm not good at
memorizing, but I can say
specific things</i>

12:12.097 --> 12:14.568
that I need to say
when I'm put on the spot.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.038
Thanks, ladies.

12:16.038 --> 12:17.575
All right,
so now what happens

12:17.575 --> 12:20.413
is you're each
gonna get a beauty shot.

12:20.413 --> 12:23.385
Ready?
Now the movement.

12:23.385 --> 12:25.991
I like it.
Beautiful.

12:25.991 --> 12:28.864
All right, Courtney,
nice and strong.

12:28.864 --> 12:30.199
Yeah!

12:30.199 --> 12:33.238
Nice.
Beautiful. Good.

12:36.011 --> 12:37.247
First of all,
I just want to say

12:37.247 --> 12:38.917
congratulations, ladies,
you all did a great job.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.554
Being Ambassador is never easy.

12:40.554 --> 12:42.457
Let's start
off with India.

12:42.457 --> 12:46.966
I wish you were a bit more
engaging with your presentation.

12:46.966 --> 12:50.072
Coryanne, you were a little
nervous in your presentation,

12:50.072 --> 12:53.914
but I was very impressed,
so was Kathy with your ability

12:53.914 --> 12:58.056
to show off your personality
as a Brand Ambassodor.

12:58.056 --> 12:59.626
Okay, Tatiana
and Courtney.

12:59.626 --> 13:01.629
Tatiana, it's clear

13:01.629 --> 13:04.401
you are the most experienced
in selling a product

13:04.401 --> 13:09.277
but sometimes
you felt more like
a makeup artist.

13:09.277 --> 13:11.984
Courtney,
you started off very strong.

13:11.984 --> 13:13.419
- Yes.
- Rita: But then,

13:13.419 --> 13:15.223
when I asked you
how to keep the lip liner on

13:15.223 --> 13:17.427
you told me use a straw.

13:17.427 --> 13:18.831
I get it.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.135
You were kind of trying to
figure out what the answer was,

13:21.135 --> 13:22.605
but that wasn't
the way to finish it off.

13:22.605 --> 13:24.107
Agreed.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.713
So it was a
tough decision.

13:26.713 --> 13:29.952
And the model who best
represents Rimmel London

13:29.952 --> 13:33.092
as Brand Ambassador is...

13:36.232 --> 13:37.635
- Coryanne.
- Yah.

13:37.635 --> 13:40.306
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

13:40.306 --> 13:41.977
You were really
convincing.

13:41.977 --> 13:44.314
You mentioned argan oils,

13:44.314 --> 13:46.820
you kinda
mentioned the ingredients
in the product,

13:46.820 --> 13:50.093
and you were engaging
as a Brand Ambassodor.

13:50.093 --> 13:53.032
So as the winner,
you will receive

13:53.032 --> 13:55.336

makeup kit

13:55.336 --> 13:58.275
plus a special surprise

13:58.275 --> 14:00.146

find out later on.

14:00.146 --> 14:01.983
- Thank you.
- Can you pick a friend

14:01.983 --> 14:03.319

enjoy your prize?

14:03.319 --> 14:05.189
Oh, no.

- I can't tell you.

14:08.162 --> 14:10.332
Okay, um,

27:57.186 --> 27:59.456

struggle or hardship

28:02.429 --> 28:04.934
<i>I went through

28:04.934 --> 28:06.605

28:06.605 --> 28:08.007
that led me
up to this point

28:08.007 --> 28:10.011
was there and happened
for a reason.

28:10.011 --> 28:12.717
I think I'm just
hypersensitive to what
people think of me

28:12.717 --> 28:15.957
where like I literally
have thought that, like,

28:15.957 --> 28:18.027
you and Cory,
like, hated me.

28:18.027 --> 28:20.132
Oh, Courtney.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.669
Yeah, like legit.

28:21.669 --> 28:23.606
I don't hate you.
I've never hated you.

28:23.606 --> 28:25.710
I think that
you're a dope person.

28:25.710 --> 28:27.346
We just all need
to learn through each other

28:27.346 --> 28:28.950
and be open to learning
through each other,

28:28.950 --> 28:30.520

allow anyone

28:30.520 --> 28:32.356

anything about Courtney.

28:32.356 --> 28:34.528

it's hard to hear ( bleep )
about yourself.

28:34.528 --> 28:36.565
We all get judged every week,
so why would you want to be

28:36.565 --> 28:39.003
judged by someone
who's on your level,
you know?

28:39.003 --> 28:41.508
Courtney is misunderstood
sometimes.

we've had our differences,</i>

28:43.713 --> 28:45.382

28:45.382 --> 28:46.752
We're all just here growing.

28:46.752 --> 28:49.023
I'm learning how to be
more acceptive of people

28:49.023 --> 28:50.927
and their quirks
and their things,

28:50.927 --> 28:53.164
'cause I'm a
really controlled person
and I like things my way

28:53.164 --> 28:54.568

everything's not about me.

28:54.568 --> 28:56.337
- Yeah.
- Everything's not my way.

Rimmel's all about.

31:12.978 --> 31:14.881

31:14.881 --> 31:18.054
<i>about your face.</i>

31:18.054 --> 31:19.725

<i>"You will never be on

31:43.238 --> 31:45.308
if all of us told you

it doesn't matter
because you can be
commercial here,

31:48.583 --> 31:51.822

practice to be editorial later.

- I do.

Ah, thank you so much.

38:13.418 --> 38:16.323
<i>I'm so excited to be a
part of the top three.</i>

38:16.323 --> 38:17.994
I can see the light
at the end of the tunnel,

38:17.994 --> 38:20.165
and it's really crazy
how my mind has just changed

38:20.165 --> 38:22.235
and I'm envisioning myself
as a winner now.

38:22.235 --> 38:25.776
Rita:
<i>We've got two spots left.</i>

38:25.776 --> 38:27.813
The second finalist is...

38:30.986 --> 38:34.392
- Tatiana.
- Thank you so much.

38:36.063 --> 38:38.635
Tatiana:
I went from like one in 28
to one in three.

38:38.635 --> 38:40.606
I'm super confident
in everything that I do,

38:40.606 --> 38:43.679
and I just know
that I got this.

38:43.679 --> 38:46.651
Will Coryanne and Courtney
please step forward.

38:49.690 --> 38:52.362
Courtney, at the start
of this competition,

38:52.362 --> 38:53.765
<i>you stood out.</i>

38:53.765 --> 38:56.003
You took beautiful photos,

38:56.003 --> 38:59.176
<i>but it's more than just
beauty in this competition.</i>

38:59.176 --> 39:03.284
We know you can book
any editorial campaign,

39:03.284 --> 39:07.259
but we wonder
if you are the versatile model

39:07.259 --> 39:09.429
<i>we're looking for.</i>

39:09.429 --> 39:12.268
Coryanne,
although the commercial
you delivered today

39:12.268 --> 39:14.172
<i>was impressive,</i>

39:14.172 --> 39:18.047
the fact that you
struggled to deliver the tagline

39:18.047 --> 39:20.218
<i>concerns us.</i>

39:20.218 --> 39:22.657
You seem like
a new person today,

39:22.657 --> 39:24.627
<i>and you've broken out
of your shell,</i>

39:24.627 --> 39:28.000
but is it too little too late?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.403
So the name I call

39:29.403 --> 39:34.212
will be third finalist
in this competition.

39:38.556 --> 39:40.224
Coryanne.

39:42.195 --> 39:44.132
Congratulations.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.570
Coryanne:
<i>Thank God.</i>

39:45.570 --> 39:47.573
<i>I absolutely gave it
my all this week.</i>

39:47.573 --> 39:49.409
<i>I have a one
in three chance</i>

39:49.409 --> 39:51.080
of becoming
"America's Next Top Model,"

39:51.080 --> 39:52.082
and I can do this.

39:52.082 --> 39:53.752
Courtney.

39:55.421 --> 39:57.425
Did you listen
to what I said, what we said?

39:57.425 --> 39:59.764
You are an amazing model.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.568
Don't let anybody
tell you different.

40:01.568 --> 40:04.272
You take
incredible photographs.

40:04.272 --> 40:05.909
When you look back
at your whole body of work,

40:05.909 --> 40:08.481
you're gonna be so proud.

40:08.481 --> 40:11.320
- Thank you, Courtney.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

40:13.658 --> 40:16.029
Courtney:
Being in the final four
was amazing.

40:16.029 --> 40:18.401
I've definitely
grown as a model,

40:18.401 --> 40:20.539
<i>but I've also
grown as a person,</i>

40:20.539 --> 40:23.044
<i>and I've grown to
understand myself better.</i>

40:23.044 --> 40:26.751
<i>And I don't think I really
realized how big of an
impact</i>

40:26.751 --> 40:29.122
<i>this competition
was gonna make on me.</i>

40:29.122 --> 40:31.227
It was great.

40:31.227 --> 40:33.464
<i>I wanted this
really, really bad,</i>

40:33.464 --> 40:36.203
<i>but I'm grateful
for the experience.</i>

40:38.675 --> 40:40.111
Congratulations, girls.

40:40.111 --> 40:42.449
You are the three finalists.

40:42.449 --> 40:44.286
<i>The next time
we meet in this room</i>

40:44.286 --> 40:47.425
we will have the winner of
"America's Next Top Model."

40:47.425 --> 40:49.964
Congratulations.
See you soon.

40:59.215 --> 41:00.285
This is the final.
This is the final.

41:00.285 --> 41:02.155
Coryanne:
<i>This is the grand finale.</i>

41:02.155 --> 41:05.996
<i>This is where we prove
who "America's Next Top Model"
is.</i>

41:05.996 --> 41:08.100
Face to me.
Yeah.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.873
India:
I'm especially nervous today
because it's our

41:10.873 --> 41:12.442
<i>final shoot
for "Paper" magazine.</i>

41:12.442 --> 41:15.481
- You're very edgy for
you, Coryanne. - Thank you.

41:15.481 --> 41:17.920
I see a winner
like how I see a Tyra.

41:17.920 --> 41:21.160
- Oh, hello.
- ( screaming )

41:21.160 --> 41:28.575
The winner of
"America's Next Top Model" is...
