WEBVTT

00:05.253 --> 00:06.881
Welcome back
to <i>Tool Time</i> on location.

00:06.955 --> 00:08.685
We're here in Melvindale.

00:08.756 --> 00:10.595
That's right, Heidi.
We're doing a special renovation

00:10.625 --> 00:12.992
- on the home of Marcy Miller. Say hi.
- Hello.

00:13.061 --> 00:16.395
Marcy's recently taken up one
of America's fastest-growing hobbies,

00:16.464 --> 00:17.796
collecting fine wine.

00:17.865 --> 00:19.891
Now, for most of us,
the collection of fine wines

00:20.001 --> 00:21.902
has been associated
with rich, snooty people.

00:21.970 --> 00:25.429
Lovey, don't waste
the Bordeaux on Gilligan.

00:27.241 --> 00:29.733
But not anymore.
Lots of people are collecting wine.

00:29.811 --> 00:31.040
And to help Marcy out,

00:31.112 --> 00:34.742
we're converting her whole butler's
pantry into a wine locker.

00:34.816 --> 00:37.581
Now, our first step is to take out
the old cabinets and shelves here.

00:37.652 --> 00:38.745
Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

00:38.820 --> 00:40.725
The first step is to get rid
of the old butler. Excuse me.

00:40.755 --> 00:45.318
Jeeves, walk yourself to the curb,
but leave the silver here. Bye-bye.

00:46.394 --> 00:47.487
You nut.

00:51.265 --> 00:52.537
Okay, we've finished gutting our room,

00:52.567 --> 00:54.695
now it's time
to create a moisture barrier.

00:54.769 --> 00:58.331
This allows us to control the climate
regardless of outside conditions.

00:58.439 --> 01:02.604
To start, we've covered our walls
with 3-mil plastic sheeting.

01:02.710 --> 01:05.578
Shields moisture out,
locks freshness in.

01:07.849 --> 01:11.411
Okay, the guys have just finished
installing our climate-control system.

01:11.486 --> 01:14.012
This is a combination
refrigerator/humidifier,

01:14.088 --> 01:18.822
which will allow Marcy to keep the room
at 55 degrees with 65% humidity.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.522
And a 10% chance of showers.

01:24.866 --> 01:26.835
Well, we've put in our redwood racks.

01:26.901 --> 01:28.529
Now, if you're on a limited budget,

01:28.603 --> 01:31.767
you can substitute PVC pipe
for the redwood.

01:31.839 --> 01:34.707
There's Marcy right now. Marcy, what
do you think of your new wine room?

01:34.776 --> 01:37.803
Oh, it looks terrific.
But these shelves are so tall.

01:37.879 --> 01:40.940
- Are you sure they won't tip over?
- Not a chance.

01:41.015 --> 01:44.349
I fastened these to the walls and floors
with seven-inch bolts myself.

01:44.419 --> 01:46.581
Added some extra weight here
for stability.

01:46.687 --> 01:48.053
Good thinking, Tim.

01:48.122 --> 01:51.092
Well, I love it.
And to commemorate the occasion,

01:51.192 --> 01:56.654
I'm going to add this rare
'56 Mouton Rothschild.

01:57.365 --> 01:59.732
Okay. Now,
because of the added weight,

01:59.834 --> 02:02.895
we've also taken the precaution
of reinforcing the floor.

02:02.970 --> 02:04.461
- We did?
- Didn't we?

02:04.539 --> 02:05.700
I didn't. Did you?

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:14.041 --> 03:15.168
Sounds great, Scott.

03:15.243 --> 03:17.482
I can't thank you enough
for re-jetting the carburetor for me.

03:17.512 --> 03:19.777
Hey, no problem. No problem.
Now, what should I do

03:19.847 --> 03:21.338
with all these leftover parts?

03:22.783 --> 03:24.479
Oh, no!

03:24.552 --> 03:26.919
I'm just kidding you, buddy.
Just kidding you.

03:27.021 --> 03:28.649
You really know your stuff.

03:28.723 --> 03:30.487
I'm really happy
Heidi married a car guy.

03:30.591 --> 03:33.493
Well, she said
you'd have fired her if she didn't.

03:34.529 --> 03:36.000
I really like your wife. She's a great gal.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.464
Yeah. I'm a lucky guy, too.

03:38.833 --> 03:41.598
Just in time.
Mark's doing a video on the family.

03:41.702 --> 03:44.467
Scott and I just finished
re-jetting the carburetor on the Nomad.

03:44.539 --> 03:48.306
Well, actually, Scott did it. I watched.
Anyway, we're all finished.

03:48.409 --> 03:51.743
Week three. Dad claims
he's finished with the Nomad.

03:53.414 --> 03:55.315
The delusion continues.

03:55.950 --> 03:57.889
Oh, ye of little faith.
Okay, let me put it this way.

03:57.919 --> 04:00.753
The Nomad is done, finished. Finito!

04:01.389 --> 04:04.553
Unless we slap a blower on her.

04:10.097 --> 04:11.929
This thing would run like a scalded cat!

04:11.999 --> 04:14.093
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:14.168 --> 04:16.933
If you would like to learn more
about obsessive-compulsive behavior,

04:17.004 --> 04:18.767
please consult your local library.

04:20.207 --> 04:21.903
There's room for a blower
right over here.

04:21.976 --> 04:25.208
Put nitrous on those, you'd get
about 200 extra horses out of this.

04:25.279 --> 04:26.975
Sweetheart, we should get going.

04:27.048 --> 04:29.517
He just got here.
Can't he stay for the test drive?

04:29.584 --> 04:31.553
No, and he can't sleep over, either.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.781
Heidi and I are having
our own slumber party.

04:33.854 --> 04:35.288
A slumber party?

04:35.356 --> 04:38.485
Yeah. They finally got a night to
themselves. Her mom's got the baby.

04:38.559 --> 04:40.289
And I got my baby.

04:40.795 --> 04:43.162
Hey, hey, hey! We're in a garage.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.727
Any and all affection must be directed
towards the car.

04:50.838 --> 04:52.009
You know, Tim and I were talking about

04:52.039 --> 04:53.578
the four of us
doing something together.

04:53.608 --> 04:57.045
That would be great. I haven't had any
time for fun lately. What should we do?

04:57.111 --> 04:58.602
Why don't we go to dinner?

04:58.679 --> 05:00.648
Oh, that sounds fun,

05:01.515 --> 05:03.950
but we were thinking
about a wrestling match.

05:04.018 --> 05:05.486
We'd kill you.

05:06.821 --> 05:08.426
Channel 8 gave us
sportswriters free tickets.

05:08.456 --> 05:12.826
That's right. To see Screaming Steve
Sanchez versus The Exterminator.

05:12.927 --> 05:16.887
Channel 8's tickets are so close, you'd
be wiping sweat off your foreheads.

05:17.832 --> 05:19.403
I got it. I got it. We'll go out to dinner,

05:19.433 --> 05:21.265
and you two can
wrestle over the check.

05:24.071 --> 05:26.233
So, Wendy,
why don't you tell me a little

05:26.307 --> 05:28.936
about why you decided
to start therapy?

05:30.411 --> 05:33.347
Well, work is going great.

05:33.414 --> 05:37.249
And I am in love with the most
wonderful man in the world.

05:37.485 --> 05:40.853
I can see how that would be a problem
for some women.

05:41.188 --> 05:44.920
No. The problem is he's married.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.194
I'm sorry.

05:47.561 --> 05:50.395
- How did all of this get started?
- We used to work together.

05:50.464 --> 05:53.798
But we always had this great
mental chemistry.

05:53.868 --> 05:57.032
Do you know what it's like when you
and a man that you are crazy about

05:57.104 --> 05:59.630
are on the same
intellectual wavelength?

06:00.241 --> 06:04.303
No. But go on.

06:04.378 --> 06:06.745
Well, one night last spring,

06:06.847 --> 06:09.510
I was at the TV station
where I used to work, Channel 8,

06:09.583 --> 06:11.882
and Scott and I
were both stuck there late,

06:11.952 --> 06:13.157
writing extra sports columns...

06:13.187 --> 06:16.351
Hold on a second. Did you say Scott?

06:16.891 --> 06:20.658
Yeah, Scott. Well, anyway,
it was late, and we got hungry...

06:20.761 --> 06:22.320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

06:22.430 --> 06:25.366
I wanna make sure
that I heard you correctly.

06:25.866 --> 06:29.564
You did say Channel 8, the TV station?

06:30.271 --> 06:32.206
Yeah, the TV station.

06:33.107 --> 06:34.131
Anyway, it was...

06:34.208 --> 06:35.579
The only reason I ask
is that sometimes,

06:35.609 --> 06:38.841
if a patient's under stress, they'll
get their facts confused, you know?

06:38.913 --> 06:41.405
Like they might say TV station
when really what they mean is

06:41.482 --> 06:43.849
a train station or a bus station.

06:46.087 --> 06:47.851
Are you under stress?

06:49.323 --> 06:53.761
No! No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. Go on.

06:54.328 --> 06:57.389
Anyway, it was late,
and Scott and I were really hungry,

06:57.465 --> 07:01.163
so we ended up going out
for dinner and drinks and...

07:01.836 --> 07:03.116
Then, the next thing you know...

07:03.170 --> 07:04.866
You slept together.

07:04.939 --> 07:09.172
Yeah. Well, he was a little hesitant,
but I just could not stop myself.

07:09.243 --> 07:11.610
I mean, he is so sweet
and so gorgeous.

07:11.712 --> 07:13.351
And he has just got the greatest hair,
I mean...

07:13.381 --> 07:18.547
Yeah, blond, big shoulders,
and that whole... I'm just guessing.

07:20.187 --> 07:23.157
Well, anyway, we had
a great time together and...

07:23.924 --> 07:26.223
Look what he surprised me with.

07:27.528 --> 07:28.689
An owl?

07:29.463 --> 07:32.092
Well, do you think there's
any significance to the owl?

07:32.199 --> 07:35.658
Well, perhaps in his mind, it represents

07:35.736 --> 07:39.195
a clandestine relationship taking place
under the cover of darkness.

07:39.306 --> 07:41.275
Or he just likes hooters.

07:42.977 --> 07:44.036
Yeah.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.776
Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:47.848 --> 07:51.410
You're going to have to assign another
therapist to Wendy Reynolds' case.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.084
Conflict of interest.

07:56.157 --> 07:58.991
This affair affects somebody
that my husband works with.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.091
Yeah.

08:02.463 --> 08:05.023
Thank you. I really appreciate it,
Doctor Gerringer.

08:06.066 --> 08:07.534
What affair?

08:09.403 --> 08:11.133
I can't talk about it.

08:11.205 --> 08:14.232
Come on. Some affair at work?
Let me guess. Let me guess.

08:14.308 --> 08:16.743
It's Al, isn't it? Huh?

08:17.178 --> 08:19.204
It's a classic case, psychologically.

08:19.513 --> 08:21.004
He's way too close to his mom.

08:21.081 --> 08:23.448
His house is too tidy.
He's gay, isn't he?

08:25.186 --> 08:26.711
It's not Al.

08:26.787 --> 08:28.255
Don't ask me any more questions.

08:28.322 --> 08:31.349
It violates my doctor/patient
confidentiality.

08:31.725 --> 08:33.489
I respect that, too.

08:35.895 --> 08:38.263
It's Marv, the camera guy, right?

08:38.933 --> 08:41.164
It's not Marv, and the subject is closed.

08:41.235 --> 08:42.438
- Milton!
- Milton doesn't go in

08:42.469 --> 08:44.164
for that sort of thing!

08:45.873 --> 08:47.637
It's not me, is it?

08:51.512 --> 08:52.673
Heidi!

08:52.913 --> 08:54.279
She's cheating on Scott.

08:54.348 --> 08:56.408
The guy just rebuilt my carburetor,
for God's sake!

08:56.483 --> 08:59.112
It's not Heidi.
Heidi would never do anything like that.

08:59.186 --> 09:00.324
Heidi wouldn't do anything like that?

09:00.354 --> 09:02.626
Oh, and you're suggesting Scott
would do something like that?

09:02.656 --> 09:04.420
Oh, you know, it's always the man!

09:04.492 --> 09:06.984
You women get up on your
high moral horse, you know?

09:07.061 --> 09:09.621
This guy would not do anything
like that! He's a car guy!

09:09.697 --> 09:11.222
This car guy did do that.

09:11.298 --> 09:13.824
I don't believe it. He's a Chevy guy.

09:14.535 --> 09:17.266
He's parking his Chevy
in another garage.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.836
- I don't believe it.
- Tim...

09:23.110 --> 09:25.272
Look, this new patient

09:25.379 --> 09:28.349
came into my office today and told me
that she was having an affair

09:28.449 --> 09:32.614
with a good-looking,
married sportswriter named Scott

09:32.686 --> 09:34.552
who works at Channel 8.

09:34.622 --> 09:37.592
"Good-looking, married sportswriter,
named Scott who works at Channel 8."

09:37.658 --> 09:40.628
And you naturally assume it's the same
good-looking, married sportswriter

09:40.694 --> 09:44.461
that works at Channel 8,
named Scott, who's married to Heidi?

09:45.933 --> 09:47.868
Tim, it's the same Scott!

09:47.935 --> 09:52.305
He wined her, he dined her and then
he surprised her with a wooden owl.

09:57.244 --> 09:59.907
I've never heard it called that before.

10:03.517 --> 10:06.385
It's a pin. He bought her jewelry.

10:06.854 --> 10:07.947
Oh.

10:11.392 --> 10:12.883
You can't listen to this woman.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.294
I mean, she's in for therapy.
Obviously, she's a little off-kilter.

10:16.363 --> 10:17.729
Probably desperate.

10:17.798 --> 10:20.097
I mean, why else would
she be going to a student therapist

10:20.167 --> 10:21.897
when she could get a real one?

10:24.705 --> 10:28.608
Because there's a lot of damn
good ones out there, right? Yeah!

10:28.809 --> 10:31.415
What if the affair is still going on?
What are we going to do about Heidi?

10:31.445 --> 10:33.141
Nothing! It's not the same Scott!

10:33.213 --> 10:34.943
How do you know?
How can you be so sure?

10:35.015 --> 10:36.176
Honey, listen to me.

10:36.250 --> 10:39.277
When you work on a car with a guy,
you get to know him.

10:39.353 --> 10:41.720
You share secrets. I would have known.

10:42.222 --> 10:44.194
Tim, I know you like to think
the best of your car guys,

10:44.224 --> 10:45.988
but I'm absolutely certain it's him.

10:46.460 --> 10:48.299
- You gotta talk to Heidi.
- I'm not talking to Heidi.

10:48.329 --> 10:49.733
- You can't talk to Heidi.
- I can't talk to Heidi.

10:49.763 --> 10:52.036
- It'll hurt her. You gotta talk to Scott.
- I'm not talking to Scott.

10:52.066 --> 10:53.203
- No, you can't talk to Scott.
- I can't, no.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.372
And it violates my doctor/patient
confidentiality with Wendy.

10:55.402 --> 10:56.674
- There's one more thing.
- What?

10:56.704 --> 10:58.229
It's not the same Scott.

10:58.305 --> 11:00.638
- You're in denial!
- I am not.

11:00.708 --> 11:01.767
- Are, too!
- Are not!

11:01.842 --> 11:02.842
- Are, too!
- Are not!

11:02.910 --> 11:03.910
Are, too!

11:04.478 --> 11:08.848
For more information on marital stress,
please consult a licensed counselor.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.387
I'm so glad we're finally able
to get together.

11:15.489 --> 11:19.051
This is fun. Not big, greasy men
body-slamming each other.

11:19.994 --> 11:22.520
We'll save that for our anniversary.

11:23.964 --> 11:26.832
Isn't there supposed to be a celery
stalk or pickle in the Bloody Marys?

11:26.900 --> 11:30.462
Sometimes in life,
we do not get everything we want.

11:33.207 --> 11:35.446
You know, we've been coming
to this restaurant for 10 years.

11:35.476 --> 11:37.843
When are we going to get
something other than the attitude?

11:37.945 --> 11:40.312
When you go to another restaurant.

11:43.117 --> 11:44.779
You know, guys, we should order soon

11:44.852 --> 11:46.753
'cause I gotta get back
to the station by 10:00.

11:46.820 --> 11:49.187
- Are you working late again tonight?
- Yeah.

11:49.656 --> 11:50.656
Yeah.

11:50.724 --> 11:53.091
A lot of guys named Scott work late.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.823
Well, I'm interviewing that wrestler,
The Exterminator.

11:55.896 --> 11:58.235
I'd like to know if he really has
a metal plate in his head.

11:58.265 --> 12:00.393
Just take a magnet with you.

12:01.001 --> 12:02.765
Will you guys stop talking about work?

12:02.836 --> 12:06.000
Let's just enjoy this time
while we have it, shall we?

12:10.043 --> 12:11.909
Look at Heidi's chest.

12:15.249 --> 12:16.877
Okay, you just noticed?

12:19.453 --> 12:20.682
The pin.

12:20.754 --> 12:22.120
- My pin? Do you like it?
- Yes.

12:22.189 --> 12:24.852
This was a gift from Scott. I love it.

12:25.526 --> 12:27.995
You know what? I'm gonna go call
the sitter and check on Amy.

12:28.062 --> 12:30.088
- I'll be right back.
- Okay. Okay.

12:34.034 --> 12:37.334
Let's see...
Well, the specials look good.

12:38.906 --> 12:41.466
See? I told you it was the same Scott!

12:43.377 --> 12:47.280
What are you hitting me for?
Scott's the one cheating on his wife.

12:47.648 --> 12:48.877
What'd you say?

12:48.949 --> 12:53.284
We're just talking about the pin. What,
do you buy those things by the gross?

12:55.689 --> 12:57.214
Tim?

12:57.291 --> 12:58.395
When you want to go back to work,

12:58.425 --> 13:00.451
do you mean you're going back
to work on Wendy?

13:00.527 --> 13:02.189
Will you shut up?

13:02.529 --> 13:04.968
- What are you talking about?
- That was confidential information.

13:04.998 --> 13:06.270
What'd you tell me
in the first place for?

13:06.300 --> 13:08.826
I was upset for Heidi.
I needed somebody to talk to about it.

13:08.902 --> 13:11.269
I didn't know that you would
blurt it all out.

13:11.371 --> 13:13.670
Once again, you underestimate me.

13:14.908 --> 13:18.777
So you guys know about Wendy.
I don't know what to say.

13:18.846 --> 13:22.806
Well, I bet you know what to say when
you're working on Wendy's float bowls.

13:24.751 --> 13:27.277
Wendy? Wendy Reynolds.

13:28.756 --> 13:31.521
Scott, what's going on
with you and Wendy?

13:31.625 --> 13:34.959
I'm guessing he's stuffing the cannoli.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.805
I'll give you two more minutes
to decide.

13:55.949 --> 13:57.713
You slept with Wendy Reynolds.

13:57.785 --> 13:58.946
It was months ago

13:59.019 --> 14:01.386
before she left the station,
when you and I were separated.

14:01.455 --> 14:03.390
Scott, we were separated three weeks!

14:03.457 --> 14:07.417
I didn't know what I was doing.
I was lonely. I was miserable.

14:07.528 --> 14:11.295
I was lonely. I was miserable.
But do I jump in the sack with Tim?

14:15.402 --> 14:17.098
The veal looks good.

14:19.039 --> 14:23.704
Yeah, you know, when I was younger,
I used to call that "veal parma-gain-ia."

14:24.511 --> 14:28.471
Heidi, it was the biggest mistake
of my life.

14:28.582 --> 14:30.710
And I'm really, really sorry.

14:30.884 --> 14:34.048
I thought we had an open
and honest relationship.

14:34.421 --> 14:37.448
And now I'm finding out this whole
thing has been just a big lie.

14:37.524 --> 14:38.583
It's not a lie.

14:38.659 --> 14:41.031
Guys, I think we should leave.
Here's some money for the drinks.

14:41.061 --> 14:42.586
I made a mistake.

14:42.663 --> 14:44.401
Honey, that's way too much.
We just had two drinks.

14:44.431 --> 14:45.797
- Tim!
- I love you so much!

14:46.333 --> 14:47.738
- Hold on a minute.
- I don't believe you!

14:47.768 --> 14:49.006
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

14:49.036 --> 14:51.505
- Do you have change for a $20?
- Tim!

14:52.039 --> 14:54.270
I'm sorry that we have to leave.

14:55.175 --> 14:59.442
I hope you found the free dinner rolls
to your satisfaction.

15:01.081 --> 15:03.448
Actually, they were a tad yeasty.

15:15.095 --> 15:17.997
- Got it.
- Me, too.

15:21.001 --> 15:22.936
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

15:23.003 --> 15:26.303
Doing a little sequence
on disgusting family habits.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.200
Oh, really?
Why don't you come upstairs?

15:28.275 --> 15:29.937
I'll show you what I can do with a Q-tip.

15:34.715 --> 15:36.274
I feel so terrible.

15:36.383 --> 15:39.251
So do I. I spent 20 bucks on two drinks.

15:40.454 --> 15:42.184
I'm talking about Scott and Heidi.

15:42.255 --> 15:44.815
I thought we agreed not to say
anything about this!

15:44.891 --> 15:49.056
I snapped. I just can't believe
he'd do that to my good friend Heidi.

15:49.129 --> 15:52.293
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.

15:52.899 --> 15:55.801
It's not your fault. It's totally my fault.

15:56.336 --> 15:57.668
I should've known if I told you,

15:57.738 --> 16:00.674
you wouldn't be able to keep
your big yap shut.

16:01.775 --> 16:05.337
How come when it's your fault,
it winds up being my fault?

16:05.612 --> 16:10.175
No, no, no. I should never have
betrayed my patient's confidence.

16:10.350 --> 16:11.818
What I did...

16:12.352 --> 16:15.379
I disgraced the entire
psychology profession.

16:15.489 --> 16:17.981
You think you got it bad?
Because of what Scott did,

16:18.058 --> 16:20.527
it's a dark day for all Chevy guys.

16:26.066 --> 16:28.194
Wilson, what smells so good?

16:28.435 --> 16:32.395
Well, I'm making cider for
the Hamtramck Apple Festival.

16:34.474 --> 16:35.772
It's my second try.

16:35.842 --> 16:37.470
You know,
it's amazing how one bad apple

16:37.544 --> 16:39.570
can spoil the whole bunch.

16:40.647 --> 16:42.275
Tell me about it.

16:42.749 --> 16:46.618
I just single-handedly destroyed
the whole psychology profession.

16:46.687 --> 16:49.452
Well, that's
very impressive for a student.

16:49.556 --> 16:53.823
Can you imagine the damage you can
do when you actually get a license?

16:55.228 --> 16:57.788
- I don't know that I deserve one.
- What?

17:00.267 --> 17:02.539
I had a patient come in and tell me
that she'd had an affair

17:02.569 --> 17:04.401
with Heidi's husband.

17:04.471 --> 17:08.238
Heidi found out about it because
I broke confidentiality and told Tim.

17:09.108 --> 17:11.237
Now you're telling me.

17:13.079 --> 17:16.107
Oh, my God! I did it again.
I can't believe it!

17:16.183 --> 17:18.242
I'm completely hopeless.

17:18.318 --> 17:21.117
You know, I'm just lucky that my
supervisor never found out what I did.

17:21.188 --> 17:24.420
Well, you are right because
she could've lost her license,

17:24.491 --> 17:27.050
and you could've been kicked out
of the master's program.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.594
- Really?
- Oh, really.

17:28.662 --> 17:31.530
Also, the school could've been sued,
and you might've been written about

17:31.598 --> 17:34.227
in textbooks
for future generations to study.

17:36.803 --> 17:39.329
Wilson, you're not making me
feel any better.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.170
Well, excuse me!

17:41.241 --> 17:44.473
Why do I always have to be
Santa's little helper?

17:44.544 --> 17:48.709
Well, I mean, I have wants.
I have needs. I have issues.

17:48.815 --> 17:50.420
But does anyone ever come
to the fence and say,

17:50.450 --> 17:54.751
"Wilson, do you have a problem?"
I mean, no! It's just "Me, me, me, me!"

17:59.259 --> 18:03.390
Wilson, of course you're right.
I'm so sorry.

18:03.463 --> 18:04.726
Well, I'm sorry, neighborette,

18:04.798 --> 18:08.166
but, I guess, even I sometimes need
somebody to open up to.

18:08.268 --> 18:10.897
Well, you can open up to me any time.

18:11.304 --> 18:13.068
Of course,
I don't know why you'd want to.

18:13.173 --> 18:15.665
Jill, if I wasn't comfortable
talking to you,

18:15.742 --> 18:18.109
I couldn't have snapped the way I did.

18:18.178 --> 18:19.737
- Really?
- Really.

18:20.147 --> 18:22.776
You know, you're a very good listener.

18:23.016 --> 18:25.884
I think you'll make a very fine therapist.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.484
Thank you, Wilson.

18:30.090 --> 18:32.457
I still feel bad about Heidi, though.

18:32.526 --> 18:37.555
Well, why don't you take her a peace
offering of some nice apple cider?

18:37.631 --> 18:39.361
This is a secret family recipe.

18:39.433 --> 18:43.803
- It smells so good. What's in it?
- Yeah, like I'd tell you.

18:50.710 --> 18:51.982
Would you grab that please, Brad?

18:52.012 --> 18:53.817
If it's Scott, tell him
I don't want to talk to him.

18:53.847 --> 18:56.749
You want me to tell him
you're washing your hair again?

18:56.817 --> 18:59.719
Just tell him I'm working on my car
with somebody else.

19:01.354 --> 19:03.914
Hello? Hey, Scott. How're you doing?

19:05.125 --> 19:07.685
No, no.
He's actually not here right now.

19:08.695 --> 19:11.756
Oh, really?
You have tickets to the Lions game.

19:14.868 --> 19:16.598
Fifty-yard line?

19:17.370 --> 19:20.135
No, no.
I'm afraid my dad's not interested.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.769
No, but you know I am, right?
All right, cool.

19:24.177 --> 19:26.737
All right, I'll see you Sunday then.
All righty. Bye.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.813
Well, you sure showed him, huh?

19:37.858 --> 19:39.224
What's that?

19:39.292 --> 19:41.659
Oh, it's just some apple cider
that Wilson gave me.

19:41.761 --> 19:43.821
He's acting kind of peculiar.

19:44.664 --> 19:45.927
You have any idea why?

19:45.999 --> 19:48.969
Mmm-hmm. Try some of that cider.

19:57.244 --> 19:58.542
- Heidi?
- Hi.

19:58.612 --> 20:00.137
Come on in.

20:00.213 --> 20:01.579
- Hi, Tim.
- Hi, Heidi.

20:01.681 --> 20:03.309
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

20:03.383 --> 20:06.410
Yes. Yes. Please, do.
I'm so glad that you came.

20:06.486 --> 20:07.977
We wanted to come and find you.

20:08.054 --> 20:12.924
We both feel just terrible
about what happened yesterday.

20:13.560 --> 20:17.463
Yeah, well, it was pretty embarrassing
to find out about Scott's affair

20:17.564 --> 20:19.726
in front of my friend and my boss.

20:19.799 --> 20:21.324
And the waiter.

20:22.869 --> 20:26.533
The truth is, in all that awkwardness,
I'm really glad it came out.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.140
You are?

20:28.208 --> 20:31.337
Thanks to you guys, Scott and I
ended up having a huge fight.

20:31.812 --> 20:33.508
Glad we could help.

20:34.281 --> 20:36.648
First we yelled and then, we cried,

20:36.750 --> 20:39.652
but then we really started
to examine our whole relationship.

20:39.719 --> 20:42.225
Tim and I have found that fighting
really helps our relationship.

20:42.255 --> 20:45.953
In fact, if we don't fight for awhile,
we really start to miss it.

20:49.096 --> 20:50.223
I don't miss it.

20:51.665 --> 20:53.224
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

20:53.300 --> 20:54.324
Yeah, you do.

20:54.401 --> 20:57.838
Yeah, the important thing is that you
and Scott are on the right track.

20:57.904 --> 20:59.270
No, I don't.

21:01.274 --> 21:04.608
Yeah. I think Scott and I are going
to be able to work through this.

21:04.678 --> 21:07.705
And Tim can start
taking Scott's calls again.

21:08.081 --> 21:10.744
- Great. I'm really glad.
- Yeah.

21:12.285 --> 21:13.810
You do, you know?

21:13.887 --> 21:15.412
- No, I don't.
- Do.

21:16.389 --> 21:17.823
<i>- No, I don't.
- Do.</i>

21:17.891 --> 21:19.154
<i>- Don't.
- Do.</i>

21:20.527 --> 21:23.986
Someone's having an affair at <i>Tool
Time?</i> Tell me! I'll guess! I'll guess!

21:24.064 --> 21:27.159
- I don't have the pan.
- Well, I can't help you there.

21:29.202 --> 21:30.329
Hold on a minute.

21:30.403 --> 21:33.464
Hold that thought.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.769
Wendy? Wendy Reynolds?

21:36.843 --> 21:39.472
Scott, what's going on
with you and Wendy?

21:40.580 --> 21:44.142
I'm guessing he's hiding the rigatoni.

21:50.256 --> 21:51.554
You know your stuff.

21:51.625 --> 21:53.730
You know, and I can't tell you how
important it is for me

21:53.760 --> 21:56.594
to have you a car guy because...
I just don't know the line.
