WEBVTT

00:02.173 --> 00:04.004
SO THERESA HAS BEEN

00:04.004 --> 00:06.437
WATCHING THIS SHOW
ABOUT CRIME IN THE SUBURBS.

00:06.437 --> 00:08.109
WHICH ONE? "SUBURBAN MURDER"?
"DEATH COMES A'KNOCKIN"?

00:08.109 --> 00:10.010
"HOME SWEET HOME-ICIDE"?
"GOOD MORNING, YOU'RE DEAD"?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.083
NO, NO.
"MURDER STREET, U.S.A."?

00:12.083 --> 00:13.314
(whispers)
I LOVE THAT ONE.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.385
NOT ENOUGH MURDER FOR ME.

00:14.385 --> 00:16.187
IT'S SCARING
THE CRAP OUT OF HER.

00:16.187 --> 00:18.389
SHE SHOULD BE SCARED.
THE WORLD'S A DANGEROUS PLACE.

00:18.389 --> 00:19.720
ESPECIALLY
FOR THE HUMAN HEART.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.352
I AM WAY LESS AFRAID
OF BEING KILLED BY AN INTRUDER

00:21.352 --> 00:22.723
THAN I AM OF DYING ALONE.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.225
IF YOU GET KILLED BY
AN INTRUDER, YOU WON'T BE ALONE.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.396
YOU'LL BE WITH AN INTRUDER.

00:25.396 --> 00:27.098
ANYWAY,
NOW THERESA WANTS US

00:27.098 --> 00:29.200
TO GET SECURITY LIGHTS
FOR THE BACKYARD.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.403
I'VE INSTALLED SECURITY LIGHTS--
NOT WELL, BUT I'VE DONE IT.

00:32.403 --> 00:34.365
DON'T LET THEM SELL YOU
THE GIBSON 120s.

00:34.365 --> 00:35.766
IT'S A RACKET.

00:35.766 --> 00:39.140
AND DO NOT GET
THE JOHNSON-PROCTOR 162

00:39.140 --> 00:41.212
WITH THE BORON-MAGNESIUM CORE
AND LIQUID CENTER.

00:41.212 --> 00:43.314
GOD,THOSE THINGS PISS ME OFF.

00:43.314 --> 00:44.775
SEEMS A LITTLE EXTREME.

00:44.775 --> 00:47.178
WHAT,
DO YOU GOTSTOCK IN 'EM?!

00:47.178 --> 00:48.679
(sighs)

00:48.679 --> 00:53.053
GET ME TWO MADELEINES
AND THAT SHERYL CROW CD.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.225
I'M GONNA GO WAIT IN THE CAR.

00:54.225 --> 00:55.526
(chair clatters)

00:55.526 --> 00:56.727
WILL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:56.727 --> 00:58.759
YOU KNOW HE HATES
ANYTHING WITH A LIQUID CENTER.

00:58.759 --> 01:04.435
I FORGOT.

01:04.435 --> 01:07.238
THE WINTHROP 760
IS A SOLID BULB.

01:07.238 --> 01:08.269
IT'S A SOFT LIGHT--

01:08.269 --> 01:10.271
MAKE YOUR INTRUDERS
LOOK LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.072
ELECTRONICS STORES
ARE SO BORING.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.176
THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING THAT I--
OH, DISCO BALLS!

01:15.176 --> 01:16.547
I'M GONNA LOOK FOR A GPS.

01:16.547 --> 01:19.280
I THOUGHT YOU HATED
MODERN TECHNOLOGY.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.551
YOU SAID IT'S A GODLESS VICE

01:20.551 --> 01:23.384
THAT CRUSHES EVERYTHING
TRUE AND HUMAN IN THE WORLD.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.186
YES, BUT RIGHT THEN
I WAS MAINLY FRUSTRATED

01:25.186 --> 01:27.718
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET THE INK
GOING IN MY BALLPOINT PEN.

01:27.718 --> 01:29.790
AND RECENTLY, I'VE BEEN PLAYING
THIS GAME WITH BRENDA'S GPS

01:29.790 --> 01:32.623
WHERE I JUST YELL NONSENSE INTO
IT AND GO WHEREVER IT LEADS ME.

01:32.623 --> 01:35.196
LIKE, YESTERDAY,
I SAID THIS TO THE GPS.

01:35.196 --> 01:38.229
(shouts gibberish)

01:38.229 --> 01:39.600
(whispers gibberish)

01:39.600 --> 01:40.601
WHOA.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.373
DID I WANT TO GO
TO BUILD-A-BEAR? NO.

01:42.373 --> 01:43.674
BUT DID I COME HOME

01:43.674 --> 01:45.776
WITH THE CUTEST
LITTLE FIREMAN FRIEND?

01:45.776 --> 01:48.179
YES, I DID.

01:51.542 --> 01:52.713
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE HE YELLS...

01:52.713 --> 01:54.145
(speaks gibberish)

01:54.145 --> 01:55.186
AND HE ENDS UP
IN SOME MIDDLE EASTERN VILLAGE

01:55.186 --> 01:56.617
HAVING A SPIT FIGHT
WITH A CAMEL.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.189
GENTLEMEN, MAY I HELP YOU?

01:58.189 --> 02:00.821
MY WIFE WOULD LIKE TO FEEL
A LITTLE BIT SAFER IN OUR HOME.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.423
WELL, THEN INVESTING
IN A ROBUST SECURITY SYSTEM

02:02.423 --> 02:03.724
IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.227
ALL I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR
IS A COUPLE OF FLOODLIGHTS.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.128
OH, I'M SORRY.
I-I MISUNDERSTOOD.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.861
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE TRYING
TO GET YOUR FAMILY MURDERED.

02:10.861 --> 02:12.563
(exhales deeply)
EXCUSE ME?

02:12.563 --> 02:14.305
LIGHTS BY THEMSELVES
JUST ANNOUNCE

02:14.305 --> 02:16.267
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE HOUSE
YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.169
HE'S RIGHT. YOU HEARD
ABOUT THE FLOODLIGHT BUTCHER?

02:18.169 --> 02:20.311
HE'S A SERIAL KILLER
IN ARIZONA.

02:20.311 --> 02:22.713
HE'D ONLY BREAK INTO PEOPLE'S
HOUSES WHO HAD SECURITY LIGHTS.

02:22.713 --> 02:24.575
OH, YEAH. YEAH, VERY FAMOUS.

02:24.575 --> 02:26.917
AND THEN THERE WAS THAT GANG
OF METH HEADS IN FLORIDA.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.349
THEY'D INVADE PEOPLE'S HOMES,

02:28.349 --> 02:29.850
MURDER THEM, AND THEN
THEY'D FORGET TO STEAL STUFF

02:29.850 --> 02:32.753
'CAUSE THEY WERE SO
FREAKING HIGH. EVERYBODY LOST.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.225
WHAT ABOUT
THE DOG DOOR CANNIBAL?

02:34.225 --> 02:36.387
HE WOULD ACTUALLY BREAK IN
THROUGH THE SKYLIGHTS,

02:36.387 --> 02:40.231
BUT HE'D ALWAYS TALK ABOUT DOG
DOORS JUST BEFORE HE ATE PEOPLE.

02:40.231 --> 02:41.192
WHAT ABOUT
THE PICKET FENCE MAULER?

02:41.192 --> 02:43.334
ORTHE HOPSCOTCH BUTCHER?

02:43.334 --> 02:44.365
OR THE FRONT PORCH URINATER?

02:44.365 --> 02:47.167
OR THE FLAPJACK STRANGLER?

02:48.499 --> 02:50.501
THIS REALLY GIVES ME A HEADACHE.

02:52.243 --> 02:54.675
CRAIG?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.507
LISA.

02:56.507 --> 02:57.848
HI.

02:57.848 --> 02:59.950
GOD, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU SINCE...

02:59.950 --> 03:02.413
AND AS THESE TWO HEARTS
WANDER THROUGH THIS WORLD,

03:02.413 --> 03:04.184
MAY THEY EACH
FIND THE COMFORT--

03:04.184 --> 03:05.356
(plays chord)

03:05.356 --> 03:06.657
(woman gasps, guests murmuring)

03:06.657 --> 03:09.189
I BROKE UP YOUR WEDDING.
(chuckles)

03:09.189 --> 03:11.222
BEAUTIFUL CHURCH,
BY THE WAY--

03:11.222 --> 03:12.963
HISTORIC,
YET WITH AMPLE PARKING.

03:12.963 --> 03:14.365
THAT'S UNUSUAL, ISN'T IT?

03:14.365 --> 03:17.197
CRAIG, WHAT YOU DID
THAT DAY WAS SO--

03:17.197 --> 03:18.369
I KNOW, I KNOW.

03:18.369 --> 03:19.370
ROMANTIC.

03:19.370 --> 03:20.671
I AM REALLY SORRY.

03:20.671 --> 03:22.333
WAIT, WHAT?

03:22.333 --> 03:23.534
IT WAS AN AMAZING GESTURE.

03:23.534 --> 03:26.377
IT MADE ME BITE MY LIP
LIKE THIS.

03:27.378 --> 03:28.679
LIKETHAT?
MM-HMM.

03:28.679 --> 03:30.481
IN FACT,
TODD AND I DIDN'T GET MARRIED,

03:30.481 --> 03:34.485
AND WE BROKE UP A WEEK LATER,
AND... I'M ALL ALONE.

03:34.485 --> 03:37.848
OH, MY GOD.
THAT IS TERRIBLE.

03:37.848 --> 03:39.550
AND WHO COULD FORGET
THE BUTCHER SHOP STRANGLER?

03:39.550 --> 03:40.791
OR THE POINT-BLANK SNIPER?

03:40.791 --> 03:42.723
AND THE TAP DANCE SLASHER?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.994
I DEFINITELY WANT
THE GOLD PACKAGE

03:43.994 --> 03:45.396
WITH THE PERIMETER ALARMS.

03:45.396 --> 03:46.627
GOOD DECISION. ALL RIGHT.

03:46.627 --> 03:47.898
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET
AN INSTALLER OUT TO YOUR HOUSE

03:47.898 --> 03:48.959
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

03:52.263 --> 03:54.735
I HATE TO SEE YOU GUYS
SO DRIVEN BY FEAR.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.667
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
MY GPS GAME WITH ME?

03:56.667 --> 03:58.369
LET RANDOM CHANCE
GUIDE YOU INTO THE WORLD,

03:58.369 --> 04:00.371
AND YOU'LL SEE
HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS.

04:00.371 --> 04:03.274
FINE, I'LL PLAY
YOUR STUPID GPS GAME,

04:03.274 --> 04:04.545
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
PROVE TO YOU

04:04.545 --> 04:07.348
THAT THE WORLD ISN'T
AS WONDERFUL AS YOU THINK.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.880
AFTER ALL,
IT DOES HAVE A LIQUID CENTER.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.884
I'VE GOT A DATE TONIGHT
WITH LISA.

04:13.884 --> 04:15.556
LISA?
YEAH.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.488
WEDDING LISA? SHE'S HERE?

04:17.488 --> 04:20.260
YEAH. APPARENTLY, THE GUY
THAT'S HELPING WILL IS HER DAD.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.833
HE JUST BOUGHT THIS PLACE,
AND LISA DOES THE ACCOUNTING.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.264
IT'S FATE.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.768
AH, FATE. FATE LIKES ACCOUNTING
BECAUSE IT'S SO TIDY.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.901
YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH LISA.
SHE'S NUTS.

04:30.901 --> 04:32.403
SHE CALLED YOU OUT OF THE BLUE
RIGHT BEFORE HER WEDDING.

04:32.403 --> 04:34.775
YEAH, BUT THE UNIVERSE HAS
DROPPED HER BACK INTO MY LIFE.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.277
IT'S A SIGN--A SIGN THAT SAYS

04:37.277 --> 04:39.350
CRAIG NEEDN'T WORRY
ABOUT DYING ALONE.

04:39.350 --> 04:41.982
YEAH, PAINTED OVER
ANOTHER SIGN--A SIGN THAT SAYS,

04:41.982 --> 04:44.815
"CRAIG SHOULDTOTALLYWORRY
ABOUT DATING LISA."

04:44.815 --> 04:46.016
(high-pitched voice)
ZING!

04:46.016 --> 04:47.388
(singsongy)
I MATCHED YOUR RHYTHMS

04:47.388 --> 04:49.289
AND I TWISTED YOUR WORDS.

04:50.761 --> 04:52.292
MM.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.465
YEAH, YOU DID.

04:54.465 --> 04:56.667
SO THIS IS FOR
THE INSIDE MOTION DETECTORS,

04:56.667 --> 04:59.930
THESE ARE THE WINDOW ALARMS
FOR ZONES ONE, TWO, AND FOUR...

04:59.930 --> 05:01.672
WHY IS THERE NO ZONE THREE?

05:01.672 --> 05:04.375
I'VE... GOT NO IDEA.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.036
THIS THING
IS VERY COMPLICATED.

05:06.036 --> 05:07.478
HONEY, ALL I WANTED
WAS LIGHTS.

05:07.478 --> 05:08.739
I JUST WANT THE BEST SYSTEM

05:08.739 --> 05:11.011
SO THAT MY FAMILY
CAN SLEEP PEACEFULLY.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.483
(siren blaring)

05:12.483 --> 05:13.784
ALL RIGHT.
NO, HEY, I'VE GOT IT!
AH!

05:13.784 --> 05:15.486
I'VE GOT IT!
(siren stops blaring)

05:15.486 --> 05:19.019
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY DID WE GET AN ALARM SYSTEM?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.391
I'LL LET YOUR DADDY
EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU,

05:20.391 --> 05:21.692
AND IF IT MAKES ANY SENSE...

05:21.692 --> 05:23.854
(whispers)
YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

05:23.854 --> 05:25.456
(slaps back)

05:25.456 --> 05:27.928
UH, IF I'M GONNA DEAL WITH
THIS COLOSSAL WASTE OF MONEY

05:27.928 --> 05:29.830
EVERY DAY,
I'M GONNA NEED THE PASSWORD.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.363
OH, IT'S "MAID," M-A-I-D.

05:32.363 --> 05:35.806
WAIT A MINUTE.
IS THAT THE MAID'S CODE?

05:35.806 --> 05:37.468
DON'T YOU TRUST ME?

05:37.468 --> 05:39.440
OF COURSE I TRUST YOU.
IT'S JUST THEY TOLD US

05:39.440 --> 05:41.812
NOT TO GIVE THE MASTER CODE
TO ANYBODY THAT WE CAN'T TRUST.

05:41.812 --> 05:44.344
WAIT, LET ME START AGAIN.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.117
YOU THINK I'M GONNA ROB YOU.
I'M YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND.

05:47.117 --> 05:49.079
BESIDES,
ALL YOUR STUFF IS YUCKY.

05:49.079 --> 05:51.722
BRENDA, YOU'RE JUST NOT
VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS.

05:51.722 --> 05:53.784
REMEMBER IN THE NINTH GRADE WHEN
I TOLD YOU I HAD A SEX DREAM

05:53.784 --> 05:56.387
ABOUT BERT LAHR, THAT GUY
WHO PLAYED THE COWARDLY LION?

05:56.387 --> 05:57.488
(imitating Cowardly Lion)
AW, COME ON, THERESA.

05:57.488 --> 05:58.889
GET BACK IN BED.

05:58.889 --> 06:01.392
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID
OVER THE SCHOOL INTERCOM.

06:01.392 --> 06:04.495
(normal voice) THAT WAS
YEARS AGO. COME ON. TEST ME.

06:04.495 --> 06:06.797
GIVE ME A SECRET RIGHT NOW--
SOMETHING REALLY TEMPTING,

06:06.797 --> 06:09.440
SOMETHING YOU THINK
I WON'T BE ABLE TO--

06:09.440 --> 06:10.701
WILL ONLY HAS ONE TESTICLE.

06:10.701 --> 06:12.002
HE LOST THE OTHER ONE
CLIMBING A FENCE

06:12.002 --> 06:14.575
GOING TO A DURAN DURAN CONCERT
IN 1989.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.449
DAMN IT, YOU PLAY TO WIN.

06:18.449 --> 06:20.851
SO YOU SEE,
THE SECURITY SYSTEM IS JUST HERE

06:20.851 --> 06:23.053
TO KEEP US SAFE
FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HURT US.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.384
PEOPLE WANT TO HURT US?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.556
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

06:25.556 --> 06:27.418
WHEN ARE THE PEOPLE
COMING TO HURT US?

06:27.418 --> 06:29.159
THEY'RE--THEY'RENOT
COMING TO HURT US.

06:29.159 --> 06:31.422
THEN WHY DO WE HAVE
A SECURITY SYSTEM?

06:31.422 --> 06:32.693
TO KEEP THEM OUT.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.094
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE COMING.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.526
TH-THEY'RE NOT COMING.

06:35.526 --> 06:37.468
THEN WHY DO WE HAVE
A SECURITY SYSTEM?!

06:37.468 --> 06:39.730
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,
PEOPLE ARE COMING!

06:39.730 --> 06:41.432
I KNEW IT! THEY'RE COMING!

06:45.405 --> 06:47.407
HELLO, I HAVE A DATE
WITH A VERY SPECIAL GIRL,

06:47.407 --> 06:48.609
AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD

06:48.609 --> 06:51.011
ANY ADULT-ORIENTED DRILL BITS
I MIGHT PURCHASE.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.613
CRAIG.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.984
YOU'VE MET MY FATHER.

06:55.546 --> 06:56.547
HELLO, SIR.

06:56.547 --> 06:57.888
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE

06:57.888 --> 07:00.691
WHAT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE
YOUR DAUGHTER'S WEDDING.

07:00.691 --> 07:02.453
(chuckles)

07:02.453 --> 07:04.495
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

07:04.495 --> 07:05.556
I'M GONNA GO GET MY PURSE.

07:05.556 --> 07:08.158
TAKE YOUR TIME, KITTEN.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.061
SO... SUBWOOFERS...

07:11.061 --> 07:12.503
NECESSARY? OR--

07:12.503 --> 07:13.964
SHUT YOUR STUPID MOUTH.

07:13.964 --> 07:16.937
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR LITTLE
STUNT AT THAT WEDDING COST ME?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.539
WELL, DO I HAVE TO COME AS CLOSE
TO THE NUMBER AS I CAN

07:18.539 --> 07:19.510
WITHOUT GOING OVER?

07:19.510 --> 07:22.042
BECAUSE IF SO,
I'M GONNA SAY $1. (chuckles)

07:22.042 --> 07:24.645
$42,000.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.776
(chuckles) IT WAS...

07:25.776 --> 07:27.147
IT'S VERY STEEP.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.722
I WONDER WHERE LISA IS.

07:31.722 --> 07:33.524
HERE'S THE DEAL.
YOU WANT TO DATE MY DAUGHTER,

07:33.524 --> 07:35.986
YOU'RE GONNA REIMBURSE ME
FOR EVERY PENNY.

07:35.986 --> 07:37.057
EVERY PENNY?

07:37.057 --> 07:38.529
THAT'S CRAZY.

07:38.529 --> 07:39.590
I WAS THERE FOR FIVE SECONDS.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.231
I DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT.

07:41.231 --> 07:42.493
AND IF YOU DON'T
GIVE ME THE MONEY,

07:42.493 --> 07:43.964
I'LL DESTROY
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH LISA.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.066
I HAVE A LOT OF SWAY
OVER MY DAUGHTER.

07:47.538 --> 07:48.969
YOU READY TO GO?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.171
YEAH.
WHERE YOU GOING
FOR DINNER, HON?

07:51.171 --> 07:52.673
I THOUGHT
WE'D GET SOME SEAFOOD.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.675
EH, YOU DON'T WANT SEAFOOD.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.246
YEAH,
I DON'T WANT SEAFOOD.

07:56.246 --> 07:58.909
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU DO LOVE
A GOOD PIECE OF TROUT.

07:58.909 --> 08:01.612
YEAH. LET'S GET SEAFOOD.

08:01.612 --> 08:04.615
(chuckles) SEAFOOD.
SEAFOOD IT IS.

08:04.615 --> 08:05.756
(Lisa giggles)

08:08.989 --> 08:10.661
(clatter)

08:10.661 --> 08:12.162
AND WHEN THE GPS ASKS
FOR A DESTINATION,

08:12.162 --> 08:13.664
WE JUST SCREAM NONSENSE.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.495
BRENDA AND I CAME UP
WITH THIS LAST MONTH

08:15.495 --> 08:17.928
WHEN A BEE GOT IN THE CAR
AND WE BOTH DID SOME SCREAMING.

08:17.928 --> 08:20.200
WE ENDED UP AT THE MUSEUM
OF DEHYDRATED MEAT,

08:20.200 --> 08:22.773
WHERE WE SAW A DRIED COW
YOU CAN FIT INTO A BACKPACK.

08:22.773 --> 08:25.205
YEAH, I'VE BEEN TO THAT PLACE.
PARKING SUCKS.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.978
COME ON. LET'S GET
THIS TRAIN WRECK STARTED.

08:27.978 --> 08:29.810
YES, LET'S SEE
WHAT WONDERFUL ADVENTURE

08:29.810 --> 08:31.582
THE UNIVERSE HAS
IN STORE FOR US.

08:31.582 --> 08:32.883
(beeps)

08:32.883 --> 08:34.585
(automated male voice)
DESTINATION?

08:34.585 --> 08:36.787
(shouts gibberish)

08:36.787 --> 08:40.651
DIRECTIONS TO SASH MILL CINEMA.

08:42.653 --> 08:43.994
(cell phone beeps)

08:43.994 --> 08:47.157
HUH. "NOW PLAYING--
'THE DARKEST FJORD.'

08:47.157 --> 08:50.260
"6-HOUR DIRECTOR'S CUT
WITH SUBTITLES.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.863
"A SAD, OLD MAN LIVES ALONE
IN A LIGHTHOUSE

08:52.863 --> 08:56.066
ON THE COAST OF NORWAY
WHERE THERE ARE NO SHIPS."

08:56.066 --> 08:57.838
YEAH,THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.570
YEAH.

09:01.271 --> 09:03.574
(inhales)

09:04.575 --> 09:07.077
(sighs)

09:07.077 --> 09:09.049
(sighs)

09:10.120 --> 09:11.622
(alarm blaring)
OH!

09:11.622 --> 09:13.884
I GOT IT! ALL GOOD!
KEEP SLEEPING!

09:13.884 --> 09:16.256
(automated female voice)
ZONE THREE--BREACH.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.759
ZONE THREE--BREACH.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.191
ZONE THREE--BREACH.
THERE IS NO ZONE THREE!

09:21.191 --> 09:22.562
(beeps)
THE BAD PEOPLE ARE HERE!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.234
I KNEW THEY WERE COMING!
(blaring stops)

09:24.234 --> 09:27.137
NO ONE'S COMING, OKAY?
THAT WOMAN IS A LIAR.
(dog barking in distance)

09:27.137 --> 09:28.138
EVERYBODY BACK TO BED.

09:28.138 --> 09:29.139
I WANT TO STAY
WITH YOU GUYS.

09:29.139 --> 09:30.140
ME, TOO.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.301
OF COURSE,

09:31.301 --> 09:32.773
AND MAYBE
THE LYING WOMAN IN THE WALL

09:32.773 --> 09:34.875
WOULD LIKE TO SQUEEZE
INTO BED WITH US, TOO.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.246
THERE'S A WOMAN
IN THE WALL?!

09:36.246 --> 09:40.180
NO, THERE'S NO WOMAN
IN THE WALL.

09:46.717 --> 09:48.859
(sighs)

10:01.772 --> 10:04.775
VAMPIRE!

10:04.775 --> 10:06.276
(sighs)

10:12.943 --> 10:13.944
(lowered voice)
OH, WILL'S ASLEEP.

10:13.944 --> 10:16.016
GET THE SHARPIE.
I'M AWAKE.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.287
HEY, MAN. HOW YOU DOING?
HEY. MORNING TO YOU.

10:17.287 --> 10:19.249
OHH. I DIDN'T GET
A LOT OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

10:19.249 --> 10:21.391
I TRIPPED THE ALARM,
AND THE KIDS--

10:21.391 --> 10:23.894
LISTEN UP. GOT SOMETHING
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

10:23.894 --> 10:25.956
OH, I'M SORRY, CRAIG.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF.

10:25.956 --> 10:28.298
NO PROBLEM.
SO LISA AND I ARE BACK TOGETHER.

10:28.298 --> 10:29.800
ONE LITTLE GLITCH.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.331
CHICK'S CRAZY?
JURY'S STILL OUT.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.933
HER FATHER
WANTS ME TO PAY BACK

10:32.933 --> 10:35.265
THE 42 GRAND
HE SPENT ON THE WEDDING.

10:35.265 --> 10:37.037
(scoffs) THAT'S INSANE.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.338
(snaps fingers)
(gasps) YOU SHOULD HIT HIM
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

10:38.338 --> 10:39.740
WITH A PILLOWCASE
FULL OF SODA CANS.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.042
KENNY, NOT EVERYTHING
YOU SEE IN A SEAN PENN MOVIE

10:42.042 --> 10:44.244
IS A GOOD IDEA IN REAL LIFE.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.817
FINE. THEN AT LEAST
NEGOTIATE THE PRICE DOWN.

10:46.817 --> 10:48.979
YOU'VE SEEN LISA'S DAD'S
TV COMMERCIALS.

10:48.979 --> 10:51.321
ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS MAKE
A DEAL. NO CREDIT, BAD CREDIT.

10:51.321 --> 10:52.422
HE DOESN'T CARE!

10:52.422 --> 10:54.224
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING
ANY OF THIS, CRAIG.

10:54.224 --> 10:56.386
YOU'RE ONLY WITH LISA BECAUSE
YOU'RE AFRAID OF DYING ALONE,

10:56.386 --> 10:59.189
AND WHEN YOU DO THINGS OUT OF
FEAR, YOU MAKE BAD DECISIONS.

10:59.189 --> 11:00.761
OH, LIKE PUTTING IN
AN EXPENSIVE SECURITY SYSTEM

11:00.761 --> 11:02.132
THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN OPERATE?

11:02.132 --> 11:04.895
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
THE WORLD IS MOSTLY MURDERERS.

11:04.895 --> 11:06.036
MY FRIENDS, YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

11:06.036 --> 11:08.098
YOU MUST NEVER BE AFRAID
TO ACT OUT OF FEAR.

11:08.098 --> 11:11.071
THE WORLD'S NOT THE WONDERFUL
PLACE GRANT THINKS IT IS.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.673
OH, SO YOUR ADVENTURE LAST NIGHT
DIDN'T GO SO WELL.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.445
UGH, IT WAS A DISASTER.

11:15.445 --> 11:17.677
(sentimental music playing)
(crying)

11:17.677 --> 11:21.051
YOUR DUTY AS LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER
IS DONE, SVEN.

11:21.051 --> 11:25.385
TURN OFF YOUR BEACON
AND BE AT PEACE.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.187
(sobs)

11:27.187 --> 11:29.189
(voice breaking)
IT WAS SO BORING AND DUMB.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.222
(sniffles)

11:32.222 --> 11:35.325
FINE!
IT WAS BREATHTAKING CINEMA.

11:35.325 --> 11:36.867
CLAUSSEN DUMSFELDT

11:36.867 --> 11:40.100
MAKES YON HANSEN
LOOK LIKE URN SCHVETLOCK.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.701
MMM. SO GRANT WAS RIGHT.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.904
YOU TRUSTED THE UNIVERSE,
AND IT WORKED OUT.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.236
IT WAS A FLUKE.
WE'RE GOING OUT AGAIN TONIGHT.

11:46.236 --> 11:49.409
AND SINCE IT WENT WELL
YESTERDAY, I'M QUITE CERTAIN

11:49.409 --> 11:51.411
WE'LL BE MIGHTILY CRAPPED UPON
THIS EVENING.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.443
MAYBE IT'LL RAIN, AND YOUR CAR
WILL SPIN OUT OF CONTROL.

11:53.443 --> 11:54.444
YOU'LL HIT A TREE.

11:54.444 --> 11:55.485
THANKS, MAN.

11:55.485 --> 11:56.917
(loud slap)
OHH.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.448
HIT MYSELF.

11:58.448 --> 12:00.250
(snaps fingers)

12:00.250 --> 12:02.452
ARE YOU GONNA GIVE ME
THE REAL ALARM CODE?

12:02.452 --> 12:03.353
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
TOLD ANYONE

12:03.353 --> 12:05.295
ABOUT WILL'S
HALF-EMPTY MARBLE BAG.

12:05.295 --> 12:06.426
IT'S ONLY BEEN A DAY,

12:06.426 --> 12:09.399
AND I LIKE TO THINK
OF HIS MARBLE BAG AS HALF FULL.

12:09.399 --> 12:12.432
OKAY. I FIGURED IT OUT.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.405
THE ALARM IS SET
AND EVERYTHING IS GOOD TO GO.

12:15.405 --> 12:17.307
(automated male voice)
ZONE "Q" ACTIVATED.

12:17.307 --> 12:20.470
ZONE "Q"?
WHAT THE HELL IS ZONE "Q"?

12:20.470 --> 12:21.741
AND I SWEAR
THAT'S A DIFFERENT VOICE.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.374
INSIDE MOTION DETECTORS ON.

12:24.374 --> 12:25.475
NOBODY MOVE.

12:25.475 --> 12:26.316
IF THE ALARM
GOES OFF AGAIN,

12:26.316 --> 12:27.818
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET NEW KIDS.

12:27.818 --> 12:28.819
WE CAN MOVE.

12:28.819 --> 12:30.220
WE JUST HAVE TO DO IT
REALLY SLOWLY

12:30.220 --> 12:32.422
SO WE DON'T
TRIGGER THE SENSOR.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.186
I'LL GO TO THE LIVING ROOM
AND TURN IT OFF.

12:36.186 --> 12:37.357
BE BACK IN A COUPLE HOURS.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.328
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

12:38.328 --> 12:40.760
I CAN MAKE IT TO THE BEDROOM
IN 45 MINUTES.

12:47.297 --> 12:50.300
I HAD A NIGHTMARE
THAT THE ALARM WENT OFF.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.501
(alarm blaring)

12:51.501 --> 12:54.074
AAH! I CAN'T WAKE UP!

12:54.074 --> 12:55.145
(blaring continues)

12:55.145 --> 12:56.506
(sighs)

12:57.447 --> 12:59.109
SCOOBY-DOO-BOW-BA-BO.

12:59.109 --> 13:01.151
(male electronic voice)
DIRECTIONS TO

13:01.151 --> 13:02.913
INTERSECTION OF SIXTH AND MAIN.

13:02.913 --> 13:04.484
DUDE, THAT'S SKID ROW.

13:04.484 --> 13:08.088
WE ARE SO DYING TONIGHT.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.060
(Kenny and man)
♪HOMBRE ARRIBA♪

13:10.060 --> 13:12.392
♪CON MI CORAZON♪

13:12.392 --> 13:13.393
EVERYBODY!

13:13.393 --> 13:15.525
♪HOMBRE ARRIBA♪

13:15.525 --> 13:17.467
♪CON MI CORAZON♪

13:17.467 --> 13:18.468
(high-pitched voice)
AY, AY, AY!

13:18.468 --> 13:19.569
THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC.

13:19.569 --> 13:21.872
OHH, IT WAS
A CROSS-CULTURAL DELIGHT,

13:21.872 --> 13:24.004
BUT I FIGURED OUT WHY
EVERYTHING IS GOING SO WELL.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.576
TILL NOW, GRANT'S BEEN THE ONE
YELLING AT THE GPS,

13:26.576 --> 13:28.508
AND THE UNIVERSE
HAS A CRUSH ON GRANT,

13:28.508 --> 13:31.541
SO NEXT TIME, I'M GONNA BE
DOING THE SCREAMING. (cackles)

13:31.541 --> 13:34.814
IT'S WEIRD THAT YOU'RE WORKING
SO HARD TO MAKE THINGS GO BADLY.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.547
IT'S NOT WEIRD. WHAT YOU'RE
DOING WITH LISA IS WEIRD.

13:37.547 --> 13:39.419
(sighs) NO.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.421
NO, IT'S NOT.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.294
WILL, WAKE UP.
CRAIG'S BEING WEIRD.

13:44.294 --> 13:47.097
UH, YEAH. NO, I WOULDN'T
WANT TO SLEEP THROUGH THAT.

13:47.097 --> 13:48.398
I'M NOT BEING WEIRD.

13:48.398 --> 13:50.530
I COULDN'T TALK WALTER DOWN
ON THE BASE PRICE,

13:50.530 --> 13:52.132
SO I WORKED OUT
AN ARRANGEMENT.

13:52.132 --> 13:55.465
EVERY TIME I SEE LISA,
I GIVE HER OLD MAN 200 BUCKS.

13:55.465 --> 13:57.837
LAST NIGHT WAS AMAZING.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.111
THERE'S $200 ON THE DRESSER
FOR YOUR DAD.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.014
OH, YEAH. THAT'S WEIRD.

14:04.014 --> 14:05.545
IT'S JUST A PAYMENT PLAN.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.846
OHH, THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.448
IT'S JUST LIKE
THAT FAMOUS SHAKESPEARE PLAY,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.080
"ROMEO AND THE HOOKER."

14:10.080 --> 14:11.581
YOU GUYS ARE JUST JEALOUS

14:11.581 --> 14:13.583
BECAUSE I GOT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
AT A FAIR PRICE,

14:13.583 --> 14:15.555
AND YOU TWO
ARE FLOUNDERING AROUND

14:15.555 --> 14:17.587
LIKE A COUPLE
OF FLOUNDERING FLOUNDERS.

14:17.587 --> 14:20.030
I'M NOT FLOUNDERING.
I SOLVED MY PROBLEM.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.431
I DIDN'T TELL
THERESA AND THE KIDS,

14:21.431 --> 14:22.862
BUT I DISCONNECTED THE ALARM

14:22.862 --> 14:24.564
SO EVERYONE
CAN START SLEEPING AGAIN.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.865
WHAT?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.597
DIDN'T THE INSTALLER
TELL YOU THAT THERE'S, LIKE,

14:27.597 --> 14:30.270
32 WAYS FOR A MADMAN
TO GET INTO YOUR HOUSE?

14:30.270 --> 14:31.972
YES,

14:31.972 --> 14:34.504
AND NOW THAT I'M NOT USING
MY ALARM, I'D APPRECIATE IT

14:34.504 --> 14:36.606
IF YOU DIDN'T KEEP
PUTTING THAT STUFF IN MY HEAD.

14:36.606 --> 14:37.877
WE JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE SOME MANIAC

14:37.877 --> 14:39.279
COME OUT OF THE HILLS
BEHIND YOUR HOUSE,

14:39.279 --> 14:41.511
CRAWL THROUGH THAT COMICALLY
VULNERABLE BASEMENT WINDOW,

14:41.511 --> 14:43.513
KICK DOWN THAT PARTICLEBOARD
DOOR, SLIT YOUR THROAT,

14:43.513 --> 14:46.386
AND DRAG YOUR FAMILY OFF
TO SOME CULT IN THE WOODS, WILL.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.588
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
OH, GREAT.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.261
NOW I CAN'T SLEEP WITH THE ALARM
AND I CAN'T SLEEP WITHOUT IT.

14:51.261 --> 14:52.492
WELL, YOU'D BETTER PRAY

14:52.492 --> 14:53.893
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS THE IRONIC STRANGLER,

14:53.893 --> 14:58.128
BECAUSE HE WOULD KILL YOU...
BY TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

14:59.469 --> 15:01.471
YEAH.

15:05.275 --> 15:06.536
(automated male voice)
DESTINATION.

15:08.678 --> 15:11.681
(shouting gibberish)

15:13.443 --> 15:15.445
DIRECTIONS TO

15:15.445 --> 15:18.448
ALOO'S INDONESIAN CAFE
AND SMOG CHECK.

15:18.448 --> 15:20.290
MMM.
(chuckles)

15:20.290 --> 15:21.451
SOUNDS LIKE
WE'RE IN FOR A JOURNEY

15:21.451 --> 15:23.523
THROUGH THE CULINARY WONDERS
OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.155
EW.

15:25.155 --> 15:26.396
AWESOME.

15:26.396 --> 15:27.998
(laughs)

15:27.998 --> 15:31.001
(drill whirring)

15:31.001 --> 15:33.433
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE EATING, MAN.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.165
I THINK
WE'RE IN SOMEONE'S HOUSE.

15:35.165 --> 15:37.637
LOOK, THERE'S SHAG CARPETING
IN THE KITCHEN.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.510
EMBRACE, KENNY.
DON'T RESIST.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.072
THIS IS A MAGICAL WINDOW
INTO A SIDE OF CENTRAL OHIO

15:42.072 --> 15:44.174
WE WOULD NEVER
ORDINARILY GET TO SEE.

15:44.174 --> 15:46.616
NO, IT ISN'T.
THIS PLACE SUCKS.

15:46.616 --> 15:49.649
LOOK. THERE'S A CAT
IN THAT BATHTUB.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.951
THERE'S A BATHTUB.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.284
OKAY, LOOK,
YOU GOT TO STOP PRETENDING.

15:54.284 --> 15:55.525
(clatters)

15:55.525 --> 15:56.526
ARE YOU OKAY?

15:56.526 --> 15:58.958
I'M IN TROUBLE.

15:58.958 --> 15:59.990
(clatter)

15:59.990 --> 16:01.261
(thud)

16:01.261 --> 16:04.334
HA! YES! I WIN!

16:04.334 --> 16:06.966
WHERE'S YOUR UNIVERSE NOW?

16:06.966 --> 16:10.270
OH, I SHOULD CALL 9-1-1.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.402
APPARENTLY, I HAD
A VIOLENT ALLERGIC REACTION

16:12.402 --> 16:14.644
TO SOMETHING CALLED
GROUND-UP SALAMANDERS.

16:14.644 --> 16:16.576
GEE,
I WONDER WHAT'S IN THAT.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.447
I DIDN'T ASK.

16:17.447 --> 16:19.179
THE IMPORTANT THING IS

YOU HIT ME SO MANY TIMES.

18:21.171 --> 18:23.673

18:23.673 --> 18:25.775

I-I-I JUST LOST MY MIND.

18:25.775 --> 18:27.737
I WAS SO HOPPED-UP
ON FEAR

18:27.737 --> 18:29.839
BECAUSE YOU KEPT TALKING

18:29.839 --> 18:34.384
OH, I'M SORRY, WILL.

18:34.384 --> 18:37.617

YOU HELPED ME PROVE TO GRANT

18:37.617 --> 18:41.621
THAT THE WORLD
AND THE UNIVERSE DOES SUCK.

18:48.698 --> 18:52.702
WHY, YOU SLIMY, DOUBLE-CROSSING,
NO-GOOD SWINDLER.

18:52.702 --> 18:56.306
YOU GOT A LOTTA GUTS COMING HERE
AFTER WHAT YOU PULLED.

18:56.306 --> 18:57.607

18:57.607 --> 18:59.138
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, I--

18:59.138 --> 19:02.742
I WAS JUST RUNNING LINES
FROM "THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK."

19:02.742 --> 19:05.245
IT SOOTHES ME WHEN I'M--
I'M FEELING STRESSED.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.376

19:06.376 --> 19:09.148
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.650

19:10.650 --> 19:15.225

THE PART OF HAN SOLO?

19:15.225 --> 19:17.687
(orchestral music playing)

19:17.687 --> 19:20.230
THANK YOU, UNIVERSE.

19:20.230 --> 19:22.792
I'M SORRY I EVER DOUBTED YOU.

OKAY, LISTEN.

19:24.334 --> 19:28.268

19:28.268 --> 19:30.770
(imitates Chewbacca)

19:30.770 --> 19:32.772
IS KENNY OKAY?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.904
HE'S DOING PRETTY WELL
FOR SOMEONE

19:34.904 --> 19:37.447
WHO WAS SAVAGELY BEATEN
WITH A 12-PACK OF GINGER ALE.

19:37.447 --> 19:39.779
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULDN'T
KEEP SODA IN THE HOUSE.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.912
DON'T WORRY. I'VE WORKED
IN THIS HOSPITAL. THEY'RE GREAT.

19:42.912 --> 19:45.885
THEY'LL HAVE HIM BACK TO HIS
NORMAL MONSTER FACE IN NO TIME.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.488
I'M SORRY I ALMOST
KILLED YOUR BROTHER.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.520
YOU WENT BABOON ON HIM.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.761
SO I WAS THINKING...

19:51.761 --> 19:54.824
MAYBE THE WHOLE SECURITY SYSTEM
WAS A MISTAKE.

19:54.824 --> 19:56.496
YEAH, I REALLY DON'T
THINK WE NEED IT.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.328
EVEN THE KIDS FEEL SAFER
NOW THAT THEY'VE SEEN

19:58.328 --> 20:00.930
YOUR BLIND RAGE
AND YOUR CRAZY MONKEY-STRENGTH.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.602
OOH. (laughs)

20:02.602 --> 20:05.375
HELLO, BRENDA. WELL, I'VE GOT
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU FOLKS.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.676
(sighs)

20:06.676 --> 20:09.779
BILLY DEE WILLIAMS IS RIGHT HERE
IN THIS HOSPITAL. I'M SERIOUS.

20:09.779 --> 20:12.442
HUH. AND GRANT AND KENNY?

20:12.442 --> 20:13.813
YES, THEY BOTH SAW HIM.

20:13.813 --> 20:14.844
UH, DR. SAMDI,

20:14.844 --> 20:16.916
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS,
THERESA AND WILL KEEN.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.488
WILL KEEN?

20:18.488 --> 20:22.392
THE MAN WHO LOST A TESTICLE
AT A DURAN DURAN CONCERT?

20:22.392 --> 20:23.653
WHAT?

20:23.653 --> 20:26.856
I MADE THAT UP.
I WAS TESTING BRENDA.

20:26.856 --> 20:29.459
YEAH, I CAN'T KEEP SECRETS.

20:29.459 --> 20:31.761
I ALREADY GAVE THE MAID'S CODE
TO, LIKE, SIX PEOPLE.

20:31.761 --> 20:33.833
THERE'S SOMETHING BROKEN
IN MY HEAD.

20:42.472 --> 20:44.274
HELLO, SIR.

20:44.274 --> 20:46.746
WE GOT A PROBLEM,
YOU AND ME.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.478
WHERE'S MY MONEY?

20:48.478 --> 20:50.950
UH, I GAVE IT TO THE GIRL.
I MEAN, YOUR DAUGHTER.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.922
M--LI--MY GIRLFR--
I GAVE IT TO LISA.

20:52.922 --> 20:54.454
SURE YOU DID.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.456
HEY! I JUST FOLDED THAT!

20:56.456 --> 20:57.557
DO YOU THINK
I'M SCREWING AROUND?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.889
NO! MY SOCKS! OKAY, OKAY!

20:59.889 --> 21:01.931
I SAW HER LAST NIGHT
AND I DIDN'T GIVE HER ANY MONEY,

21:01.931 --> 21:02.962
BUT WE ONLY HAD COFFEE.

21:02.962 --> 21:07.467
HEY. IF YOU SEE HER, YOU PAY.
HER TIME IS MY DIME.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.868
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:08.868 --> 21:10.800
I ONLY STARTED SEEING LISA AGAIN
OUT OF FEAR OF DYING ALONE,

21:10.800 --> 21:12.372
BUT THIS HAS ALL
GOTTEN TOO WEIRD,

21:12.372 --> 21:14.544
SO I'M GONNA
HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH HER.

21:14.544 --> 21:17.577
REALLY? OHH.
YOU GUYS ARE SO GOOD TOGETHER.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.908
I KNOW, AREN'T WE?

21:18.908 --> 21:20.910
YEAH. WELL, AT LEAST,
MY WIFE AND I BOTH THINK SO.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.883
YOU KNOW WHAT?
(snaps fingers)

21:23.883 --> 21:26.516
I'M GONNA WRITE YOU A CHECK.

21:26.516 --> 21:28.918
YOU ARE ONE HELL
OF A SALESMAN, WALT.
