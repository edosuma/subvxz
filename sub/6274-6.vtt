<i>Previously on Masters Of Sex...</i>

00:06.867 --> 00:09.118
He showed me
three apartments just today.

00:09.170 --> 00:12.554
We talked about this, Libby--
our dissatisfaction.

00:12.590 --> 00:13.589
Yes, but it was just talk.

00:13.624 --> 00:14.790
It's Joy.

00:14.825 --> 00:16.158
She... She collapsed.

00:16.193 --> 00:19.228
"Catastrophic" was the word
they kept using.

00:19.263 --> 00:20.496
I don't want to talk about it.

00:20.531 --> 00:21.630
Well, what you want
isn't the issue.

00:21.665 --> 00:23.766
I just said,
so shut up about it!

00:23.834 --> 00:25.334
This is not about you, Bill.

00:25.369 --> 00:28.804
This is about our son,
and our son needs help.

00:28.839 --> 00:33.075
Apparently, this Dennis has been
picking on him for weeks.

00:33.110 --> 00:35.477
You swung these knuckles
into my son's face.

00:35.529 --> 00:39.148
I know you're smart enough
to know that if a doctor--

00:39.200 --> 00:42.651
if a doctor threatens you,

00:42.703 --> 00:44.453
no one can protect you.

00:44.488 --> 00:47.289
Pawning off this poor baby
to some babysitter

00:47.324 --> 00:49.658
when you're going off
to do your sex work.

00:49.693 --> 00:51.427
I know you feel
your mother's hard on you,

00:51.462 --> 00:53.362
but it's because she worries.

00:53.397 --> 00:54.763
She doesn't worry about me.

00:54.799 --> 00:56.131
I underestimated you.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.132
You did?

00:57.168 --> 00:58.567
All you've got to do

00:58.602 --> 01:01.136
is get him to leave his wife
and marry you.

01:01.172 --> 01:02.571
Are you all right?

01:02.606 --> 01:05.741
How would you like
to take me to dinner sometime?

The Marshfield fair.

01:55.742 --> 01:57.159
I'm sorry?

01:57.194 --> 01:58.577
Candy apples.

01:58.612 --> 02:01.113
It reminds me
of when I was little,

02:01.165 --> 02:04.199
and my dad would buy them for me
at the fair.

02:04.251 --> 02:08.453
They had this rich,
crackly, toffee coating.

02:08.505 --> 02:12.457
I'm practically drooling
just thinking about them.

02:12.509 --> 02:15.510
Not exactly the
lubrication we were looking for.

02:15.546 --> 02:16.344
Mnh-mnh.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.712
Thank you, Holly.

02:17.764 --> 02:19.848
Feel free to get dressed now.

02:19.883 --> 02:23.635
So, smells elicit emotions
rather than arousal,

02:23.687 --> 02:24.769
leaving us... nowhere.

02:24.805 --> 02:26.855
That is the general vicinity.

02:26.890 --> 02:29.858
And even if we wanted emotion,

02:29.893 --> 02:31.443
every reaction is unique,

02:31.478 --> 02:34.446
meaning we'd have to customize
a specific scent

02:34.481 --> 02:36.948
for each customer,
which would be like

02:36.984 --> 02:39.568
moving the French Riviera
one grain of sand at a time.

02:39.620 --> 02:42.037
Do you know anything
about gypsy moths?

02:42.072 --> 02:43.672
Their natural habitat
is not the French Riviera.

02:43.707 --> 02:45.607
No, "Nature" magazine

02:45.642 --> 02:48.109
published a piece
on gypsy moths recently,

02:48.145 --> 02:50.412
about this substance
that they secrete,

02:50.464 --> 02:52.964
called pheromones,
an aphrodisiac of sorts,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.251
secreted by the female moths
to attract the males

02:56.253 --> 02:57.586
at great distances.

02:57.621 --> 02:58.787
The length
of a crowded barroom?

02:58.822 --> 03:01.139
Try 30 miles.

03:01.175 --> 03:04.142
And the strangest thing
about pheromones

03:04.178 --> 03:07.345
is that they're not something
that you smell.

03:07.397 --> 03:08.563
They're sensed.

03:24.114 --> 03:26.948
If we can bottle the human
equivalent of pheromones,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.918
we could have exactly what
I've been looking for all along.

03:29.953 --> 03:31.286
A "love potion," essentially.

03:31.288 --> 03:33.538
Except
there's no conclusive evidence

03:33.590 --> 03:35.257
that human pheromones
even exist,

03:35.292 --> 03:37.175
never mind are ready
for packaging.

03:37.211 --> 03:38.293
Oh, they exist.

03:38.328 --> 03:39.661
For example, inexplicably,

03:39.696 --> 03:41.930
a few weeks ago,
you asked me out to dinner.

03:41.965 --> 03:43.715
It was as if some unseen force
compelled you,

03:43.767 --> 03:45.467
because every time
I've brought it up since,

03:45.469 --> 03:47.135
you've managed
to worm your way out of it.

03:47.187 --> 03:49.170
No, I have not
wormed my way out of it.

03:49.206 --> 03:50.839
Then have dinner
with me tonight.

04:01.401 --> 04:04.152
Fine. Then drinks down
the street at the tap room.

04:04.154 --> 04:05.487
Can I just be honest with you?

04:05.539 --> 04:11.243
I have no idea why I asked you
out that night, but...

04:11.295 --> 04:12.494
it was wrong.

04:18.552 --> 04:20.502
So why don't we have
a cup of coffee,

04:20.504 --> 04:22.087
downstairs, in the lobby, and--

04:22.139 --> 04:24.422
and we can use the time
to strategize

04:24.474 --> 04:27.892
about how we might go
about... procuring pheromones.

04:27.928 --> 04:31.596
We can strategize.

04:31.648 --> 04:35.517
But now let me be honest
with you.

04:35.569 --> 04:41.489
You're a woman who deserves
more than coffee in some lobby.

04:41.525 --> 04:44.292
You deserve, well...

04:44.328 --> 04:46.761
what we might call
a proper courtship.

05:09.603 --> 05:13.054
You're running like you've
got the devil on your tail.

05:13.056 --> 05:14.222
Is everything all right?

05:14.274 --> 05:16.391
I was just, uh...

05:16.476 --> 05:20.028
I was just thinking...

05:20.063 --> 05:24.899
about how sometimes
people seem to just...

05:24.951 --> 05:27.702
They'll be slipping away.

05:27.738 --> 05:29.904
Who's "people"?

05:29.906 --> 05:31.906
Uh...

05:31.908 --> 05:35.327
just my son, John, for example.

05:35.379 --> 05:39.998
I just asked him this morning

05:40.050 --> 05:42.917
if he wanted to come see a
Cardinal/Bears game next Sunday.

05:42.919 --> 05:45.553
You got nothing, huh?

05:45.589 --> 05:47.305
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

05:47.341 --> 05:49.591
'Cause I was just talking
to a former Cardinal,

05:49.626 --> 05:53.028
a friend, Al Neely.

05:53.063 --> 05:55.430
Al "The Ape" Neely?

05:55.482 --> 05:57.399
Yeah, we played together
at Nebraska.

05:59.436 --> 06:03.488
He, uh-- he married that
actress, Isabella Ricci?

06:05.776 --> 06:08.777
Well, anyway,
she's been twisting his arm,

06:08.779 --> 06:11.446
trying to get him
to go see somebody

06:11.448 --> 06:13.448
about their bedroom problems.

06:13.450 --> 06:16.451
They'd heard of you
and, uh... about flipped

06:16.503 --> 06:19.037
when I told them
we were neighbors.

06:19.089 --> 06:22.841
They wanted me to put in
a good word, you know?

06:22.876 --> 06:24.459
Maybe-- maybe you'd see them.

06:24.461 --> 06:26.044
You don't have
to put in a good word.

06:26.096 --> 06:27.128
Just have them call the office.

06:27.130 --> 06:29.798
All right, I will.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.384
You're still coaching, right?

06:32.436 --> 06:35.303
- Kids' football?
- Yeah.

06:35.355 --> 06:37.222
You need an assistant coach?

06:39.943 --> 06:41.076
You?

06:41.111 --> 06:43.111
Why not?

06:43.146 --> 06:46.648
You know...
why not try?

06:46.700 --> 06:49.367
If you don't try...
nothing happens.

06:49.403 --> 06:54.456
Or... things happen
that you don't want to happen.

06:54.491 --> 06:58.793
Anyway, uh, Johnny could run out
for the team.

06:58.829 --> 07:00.662
I could help you coach.

07:00.714 --> 07:03.832
So, what do you say?

07:03.834 --> 07:06.134
I think it's a terrible idea.

07:06.169 --> 07:07.552
Well, I was already
playing football at his age.

07:07.587 --> 07:08.837
It'll be good for him.

07:08.839 --> 07:10.271
He will be in there
with boys twice his size.

07:10.307 --> 07:11.539
He could easily be injured.

07:11.575 --> 07:13.258
You can't mollycoddle
the boy, Libby.

07:13.310 --> 07:14.509
Who is mollycoddling?

07:14.511 --> 07:16.544
I'm simply saying
he is not a football player.

07:16.580 --> 07:18.680
Well, certainly not
if he doesn't try.

07:18.715 --> 07:20.982
Bill...

07:21.017 --> 07:23.017
the planetarium
has a wonderful film

07:23.069 --> 07:24.686
on the origins of the universe.

07:24.688 --> 07:25.854
Johnny would love that.

07:25.906 --> 07:27.822
Well,
I've already promised Paul

07:27.858 --> 07:29.023
I'd help him coach.

07:29.059 --> 07:33.194
You are gonna coach
youth football?

07:33.246 --> 07:35.780
"Spend more time
with the children."

07:35.832 --> 07:38.950
That's your constant refrain,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

07:39.002 --> 07:41.920
Johnny will play, I will coach.
And now I'm late for my dinner.

07:41.955 --> 07:43.705
You have a dinner?

07:43.757 --> 07:45.790
It's work, Lib, like always.

07:52.883 --> 07:55.884
I've told all my friends, Bill,

07:55.936 --> 07:59.721
that we have a famous author
in our family now.

07:59.756 --> 08:00.889
Edna keeps expecting

08:00.941 --> 08:03.024
to see you hobnob
on Linkletter's "House Party."

08:04.895 --> 08:07.695
Well, if by "family,"
you mean your daughter,

08:07.731 --> 08:09.831
certainly there would be
no book at all

08:09.866 --> 08:11.199
without her participation.

08:11.234 --> 08:13.001
It's just such a rare treat

08:13.036 --> 08:15.003
to spend quality time
with you, Bill.

08:15.038 --> 08:16.488
Time does fly, doesn't it?

08:16.540 --> 08:18.406
I was just saying to Edna
how eerie it is--

08:18.408 --> 08:19.841
We need to get a move on.

08:19.876 --> 08:22.277
Your mother's
got this crazy idea

08:22.312 --> 08:24.746
about taking the baby out
for ice cream.

08:24.748 --> 08:27.081
Mom, Lisa is 3 months old...

08:27.083 --> 08:29.584
A baby can't appreciate
ice cream?

08:29.586 --> 08:32.754
Plus, it's a nice
break for you and Bill.

08:32.806 --> 08:37.392
You can just relax and talk
about something other than work.

08:42.148 --> 08:44.599
Harry, please...

08:44.651 --> 08:46.434
Is she trying to set us up?

08:46.469 --> 08:48.570
And so subtly, don't you think?

08:48.605 --> 08:51.072
Well, how did
she come by such a notion?

08:51.107 --> 08:53.074
Not from me.

08:53.109 --> 08:55.493
As much as I would like
to take you upstairs...

08:55.529 --> 08:57.445
Having my mother
arrange it is...

08:57.497 --> 09:01.583
grotesque, to say the least.

09:01.618 --> 09:04.536
How long
before they go back home?

09:04.588 --> 09:10.174
Well, then we'll just have
to... make other arrangements.

09:12.262 --> 09:16.297
It won't do for us to be
separated this long, Virginia.

09:18.718 --> 09:20.602
It's true.

09:20.637 --> 09:26.558
I lied, and I...
deceived my husband.

09:26.610 --> 09:30.028
That is how my firstborn
came to be.

09:30.063 --> 09:31.779
Did I never tell you this?

09:31.815 --> 09:35.116
We'd been trying for years.

09:35.151 --> 09:40.321
Bill let me think that
the problem was me, of course.

09:40.323 --> 09:41.906
Anyway, I, um...

09:41.958 --> 09:45.209
I underwent
this capping procedure

09:45.245 --> 09:46.494
that Bill invented himself,

09:46.546 --> 09:50.715
because Bill is... brilliant
that way.

09:50.750 --> 09:55.303
And suddenly, I was pregnant.

09:55.338 --> 09:58.723
I was so happy.

09:58.758 --> 10:02.644
And then I had a miscarriage.

10:02.679 --> 10:07.265
And Bill said, "No more."

10:09.352 --> 10:12.403
"No more trying."

10:12.439 --> 10:17.575
It was just gonna be the two
of us for the rest of our days.

10:18.895 --> 10:23.915
So I-- I got my doctor
to secretly inseminate me

10:23.950 --> 10:28.336
using the-- the remainder
of Bill's sperm, and...

10:28.371 --> 10:34.759
like a gift from heaven,
it worked.

10:37.180 --> 10:39.981
Although...

10:40.016 --> 10:43.885
I think whatever feelings
that Bill had for me,

10:43.937 --> 10:48.890
they died that night
that he realized I deceived him,

10:48.942 --> 10:51.109
that he was gonna be a father
after all.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.483
I think you could use a clip.

11:18.004 --> 11:20.555
You startled me.

11:20.590 --> 11:22.974
I'm sorry.

11:23.059 --> 11:28.229
I was just watching you
and thinking...

11:28.264 --> 11:30.431
thank God for Libby Masters.

11:30.467 --> 11:32.100
Oh.

11:32.102 --> 11:37.271
You've been so kind to Joy
and beyond generous to me.

11:37.323 --> 11:39.741
Over these past few months,

11:39.776 --> 11:42.326
if it hadn't been for you,
I don't...

11:42.362 --> 11:45.446
Of course.
Anything for friends.

11:50.787 --> 11:52.537
Your mother's rocking the baby,

11:52.589 --> 11:54.288
humming "Chattanooga
Choo Choo"...

11:56.960 --> 12:00.712
Honey, Lisa lapped up every last
drop of that ice cream--

12:00.764 --> 12:03.131
Did you know she was
going to do that tonight,

12:03.133 --> 12:04.365
throw Bill at me in that way?

12:07.103 --> 12:08.903
You did.

12:08.938 --> 12:12.640
And did you also know that
she has told me to marry Bill?

12:12.642 --> 12:14.225
She did mention something.

12:14.277 --> 12:16.778
Well, I hope you
told her she's out of her mind.

12:16.813 --> 12:21.249
And what good would that do?

12:27.407 --> 12:31.959
Our first date, your mother
and I went to the movies.

12:31.995 --> 12:33.961
I showed up in shirt-sleeves,

12:33.997 --> 12:36.964
and she wore her grandmother's
mink stole.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.718
She's always imagined herself
being someplace better,

12:40.754 --> 12:44.338
someplace else other than
wherever she actually is.

12:44.390 --> 12:47.091
I think she pictured herself
going to galas

12:47.143 --> 12:50.228
on the arm of some politician
or doctor or lawyer,

12:50.263 --> 12:52.346
and instead,
she ended up with me.

12:52.398 --> 12:55.183
Please.
She would be lost without you.

12:55.185 --> 12:58.436
And I know that.

12:58.488 --> 13:03.608
We all need stories to tell
ourselves, and that's hers.

13:08.731 --> 13:10.865
Well, we can probably
skip the tour.

13:10.917 --> 13:13.751
I'm not sure two hours
a day warrants my own office.

13:13.787 --> 13:15.536
Mm.
You're gonna need that.

13:15.622 --> 13:17.622
Mail's up to
a thousand letters a day.

13:17.674 --> 13:19.207
They want you to answer anything

13:19.275 --> 13:22.210
that doesn't compare them to
Satan or damn them both to hell.

13:22.262 --> 13:23.845
Oh, my God.
Is that--

13:23.880 --> 13:26.214
Shh!
Lower your voice.

13:26.216 --> 13:28.883
This is a doctor's office,
not Grauman's Chinese.

13:28.918 --> 13:30.885
Isabella Ricci.

13:32.105 --> 13:35.223
Those lips have touched
Rock Hudson's lips.

13:35.258 --> 13:36.724
They touched Perry Como's lips.

13:36.810 --> 13:38.109
And look at my lips

13:38.144 --> 13:40.361
when I tell you
nobody knows they're here,

13:40.396 --> 13:44.282
which means you do not know
they're here.

13:44.317 --> 13:45.233
Can I just
walk through the lobby?

13:45.285 --> 13:46.400
You cannot.

13:46.436 --> 13:47.335
Can I just say
that I have to pee?

13:47.370 --> 13:48.503
I've had two kids.

13:48.538 --> 13:50.037
By the time I get out there,
it'll be true.

13:50.073 --> 13:53.624
Clickity-clack, Jane.
Clickity-clack.

13:58.081 --> 14:00.298
Paul tells me
you're a big football fan.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.166
I still remember the game

14:02.218 --> 14:04.118
you ran 200 yards
against the Colts.

14:04.153 --> 14:07.121
203 yards,
but who's counting, right?

14:07.156 --> 14:10.224
Our friend Sandy
absolutely raves about you two.

14:10.260 --> 14:11.092
Sandra Dee.

14:11.094 --> 14:12.593
Oh, I don't--

14:12.645 --> 14:16.147
I don't believe we've ever
worked with Miss Dee.

14:16.182 --> 14:17.648
- She read your book.
- Ah.

14:17.684 --> 14:19.100
And if you ever want
tickets to any game...

14:19.102 --> 14:20.601
What game can we get, Al?

14:20.653 --> 14:22.236
How does 50 yard line,

14:22.272 --> 14:23.688
Unitas against
the Steelers sound?

14:23.740 --> 14:25.940
Don Shula won't have
the access you'll have.

14:25.942 --> 14:27.775
Any game, any time.

14:27.810 --> 14:30.528
And I have friends
at the Ice Capades, too,

14:30.580 --> 14:32.029
in case you're interested.

14:32.115 --> 14:35.333
Oh, that's... very generous.

14:35.368 --> 14:39.370
But, uh, why don't we proceed
with why you're here?

14:39.422 --> 14:40.788
Right. So...

14:40.840 --> 14:44.926
Explain how me
not touching my wife sexually

14:44.961 --> 14:47.044
is gonna fix things
in the sex department.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.297
We've found
that non-sexual touching

14:49.349 --> 14:51.299
removes the pressure
and expectations

14:51.351 --> 14:52.800
sometimes associated with sex.

14:52.852 --> 14:54.802
We understand
that may seem incongruous

14:54.854 --> 14:56.837
to what it is
you're trying to achieve,

14:56.873 --> 14:58.773
but we've had a very high
success rate

14:58.808 --> 15:01.108
with sensate therapy
in cases like your wife's.

15:01.144 --> 15:03.561
Just to think
the word "frigidity"

15:03.613 --> 15:06.197
and this body could inhabit
the same universe...

15:06.232 --> 15:08.149
We prefer non-orgasmic.

15:08.201 --> 15:09.617
Frigid is pejorative,

15:09.652 --> 15:12.587
and it suggests that
it's the woman's fault.

15:12.622 --> 15:14.221
I just want it fixed

15:14.257 --> 15:17.458
so that we can go back to the
way we were in the beginning.

15:21.497 --> 15:23.164
What are you doing, Tessie?

15:23.166 --> 15:26.334
Oh. I-I'm just leaving
something out for my mom.

15:26.336 --> 15:28.035
Hmm.

15:31.758 --> 15:36.377
"Life And love"...
by Tessa Johnson?

15:36.412 --> 15:38.930
You wrote this?

15:38.982 --> 15:40.848
"Teen Society" has a contest,

15:40.850 --> 15:42.183
and I entered it on a lark,

15:42.185 --> 15:44.518
but then they told me
that I won, and I flipped.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.772
Oh, my.
That's really something.

15:50.076 --> 15:51.926
And will you look at this.

15:54.197 --> 15:56.414
The perfect hairstyle for you.

15:56.499 --> 16:01.168
Let's you and I have some fun.

16:01.204 --> 16:02.670
I'll make an appointment.

16:02.705 --> 16:04.588
We'll go down together, and they
will give you this hairstyle.

16:04.624 --> 16:05.456
Hmm?

16:05.508 --> 16:07.875
A girl can always do things

16:07.910 --> 16:10.411
to make herself more attractive
to the boys.

16:12.515 --> 16:15.716
I don't think this
hairstyle suits me, grandma.

16:15.752 --> 16:17.852
Come on.
Don't be like your mother,

16:17.887 --> 16:19.620
always fighting me
at every turn.

16:19.689 --> 16:21.889
Maybe she has
good reason to fight.

16:21.941 --> 16:25.026
Yes, of course.

16:25.061 --> 16:27.828
She's poisoned you against me.

16:27.864 --> 16:31.399
Your grandfather can do no wrong
in her eyes

16:31.401 --> 16:35.953
because he always tells her
exactly what she wants to hear.

16:35.989 --> 16:38.656
I'm sure nobody wanted to hear
"The British are coming,"

16:38.708 --> 16:41.242
at 3:00 in the morning,
but God bless that messenger.

16:41.244 --> 16:44.211
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

16:46.883 --> 16:48.049
I know.

16:48.084 --> 16:53.421
Look, honey,
your essay is very impressive,

16:53.473 --> 16:56.424
but think of your mother
as a cautionary tale.

16:56.476 --> 16:58.225
She's written a whole book,

16:58.261 --> 17:00.695
and look at her life--
it's a mess.

17:00.730 --> 17:03.264
Mm.

17:03.316 --> 17:05.348
There's some things that are...

17:05.401 --> 17:06.684
definitely screwed up.

17:06.736 --> 17:09.103
Just don't follow
in her footsteps, all right?

17:09.155 --> 17:12.073
You focus
on what really matters.

17:16.311 --> 17:17.828
Team, break!

17:17.864 --> 17:19.780
Ready, break!

17:19.832 --> 17:21.082
- Come on, Hornets!
- Let's go, Hornets!

17:23.869 --> 17:26.119
Okay, after the change
of possession, you're in.

17:26.155 --> 17:27.788
I don't want to go in.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.124
I don't want to play.
I told you that.

17:30.159 --> 17:32.960
Just do as your coaches
tell you, all right?

17:32.962 --> 17:34.295
Come on, offense!

17:36.365 --> 17:38.632
Come on, offense.
Oh!

17:38.684 --> 17:40.518
Jesus, he just stands there
like a clay pigeon.

17:40.553 --> 17:42.186
Well, it's not
his regular position.

17:42.221 --> 17:44.305
He's normally a tight end,
but our starting quarterback

17:44.357 --> 17:47.641
showed up 10 minutes late
for practice yesterday, so...

17:47.643 --> 17:48.692
Is he any good?

17:48.728 --> 17:50.311
He's got an arm
like a slingshot.

17:50.363 --> 17:53.147
It's his attitude
I don't care for.

17:53.182 --> 17:55.649
Hey, 14.

17:55.651 --> 17:57.318
Yeah, you ready to go in
for number 12?

17:57.320 --> 17:58.652
Hey, Bill,
the kid's got to learn.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.287
I agree.

18:00.323 --> 18:01.872
But can we figure out
some other kind of punishment

18:01.908 --> 18:03.891
that doesn't embarrass
the whole team by losing?

18:06.579 --> 18:07.728
Okay. Dennis, come here.

18:07.764 --> 18:09.363
Come on, Hornets!

18:12.201 --> 18:14.268
Now, look--
you're going in.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.754
But listen to me, son--
no more screw-ups.

18:16.806 --> 18:18.339
No more.

18:18.391 --> 18:20.558
Billy, you're out. Come on.

18:20.593 --> 18:22.593
- Go on, get in there.
- Let's go, Dennis.

18:31.571 --> 18:34.939
The new kid's yours?

18:34.991 --> 18:38.025
33, Johnny Masters.
It's our first game.

18:38.027 --> 18:41.328
There is no "our" in football.

18:41.364 --> 18:45.866
It's all about the boys,
the coaches, and the dads.

18:45.868 --> 18:47.935
I'm in charge of snacks today.

18:47.970 --> 18:52.039
Is there some
kind of... snack sign-up?

18:52.091 --> 18:54.708
Yep, and if you don't
get in the snack rotation,

18:54.710 --> 18:56.043
you're a bad mom.

18:56.078 --> 19:00.047
Got to show up at the games
'cause it's expected,

19:00.082 --> 19:02.633
not that anybody cares
you're here.

19:02.685 --> 19:05.519
But if you stay at home
and take a bath

19:05.555 --> 19:09.106
and have five blessed seconds
to yourself,

19:09.142 --> 19:12.059
well, then we're back
to bad mom.

19:12.111 --> 19:15.062
But you'll get the hang
of all this.

19:15.064 --> 19:18.199
Essentially, your job is
to be invisible...

19:18.234 --> 19:21.068
while cheering them on.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.070
Go, Hornets!

19:23.072 --> 19:25.906
Set! Hike!

19:29.579 --> 19:31.212
Watch it.
That's right!

19:31.247 --> 19:33.164
That's the way! Yes!
That's it, Dennis!

19:33.216 --> 19:34.498
Go! Yeah!

19:36.969 --> 19:39.086
Yes! That's the way!
Well done, Dennis!

19:39.088 --> 19:40.187
Well done!

19:40.223 --> 19:43.224
Good team effort.
Good team effort.

19:43.259 --> 19:46.510
2 points.
2 point conversion, let's go.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.730
So, now we've dug
ourselves out of that hole...

19:49.765 --> 19:51.031
33 goes in?

19:51.067 --> 19:52.733
33 goes in.
Hey, Johnny.

19:52.768 --> 19:53.934
Let's go. You're in.

19:56.405 --> 20:00.491
Yeah.
Stay sharp, 33.

20:00.526 --> 20:02.026
Go, Hornets.

20:04.330 --> 20:06.330
You kept your cool out there.

20:06.365 --> 20:07.665
You're an asshole.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.868
You can't speak
to your coaches like that.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.954
Mr. Edley's my coach, not you.

20:13.990 --> 20:16.123
Ready, break!

20:16.175 --> 20:19.293
Come on, defense!

20:21.464 --> 20:23.347
Look, Dennis...

20:23.382 --> 20:28.769
the last time I saw you,
I, uh...

20:28.804 --> 20:30.721
I didn't behave well.

20:30.773 --> 20:32.806
I owe you an apology.

20:32.858 --> 20:35.726
I'm sorry.

20:35.778 --> 20:37.311
Where's my football?

20:37.363 --> 20:38.646
Uh... I have it.

20:38.698 --> 20:40.564
I'll-- I'll give it back
to you.

20:40.616 --> 20:41.982
I'll bring it next game.

20:45.571 --> 20:47.488
Dennis,
you're a hell of a player.

20:47.540 --> 20:49.456
You know,
I can see that already.

20:49.492 --> 20:51.909
So I really hope
you stick with this.

20:51.961 --> 20:54.161
I mean it.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.664
You could be playing
for Nebraska one day,

20:56.716 --> 20:57.798
like Coach Edley.

21:00.553 --> 21:01.835
Hike!

21:05.224 --> 21:06.423
Hey, ref, come on!

21:06.475 --> 21:07.775
That's clipping!
Wake up!

21:07.810 --> 21:10.928
Come on.

21:10.980 --> 21:13.047
Okay, 33, that's it.
Get up.

22:17.913 --> 22:20.964
Geez. Sorry.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.302
I-I-I was just coming in
to turn off the gas,

22:25.338 --> 22:28.088
since I assumed
no one was moving in.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.923
Oh, well, I, um...

22:29.975 --> 22:32.059
I took my time with the moving,
but now I'm here.

22:32.094 --> 22:33.594
You being...?

22:33.646 --> 22:36.680
Mrs. Edley, of course.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.432
Joy Edley.

22:42.605 --> 22:44.938
So,
your marital problems started

22:44.974 --> 22:46.940
about a year ago.
Is that correct?

22:46.976 --> 22:48.776
Give or take.

22:48.828 --> 22:51.695
Truth is,
Isabella overthinks things.

22:51.747 --> 22:53.781
I tell her
I want steak for dinner.

22:53.833 --> 22:56.784
She thinks
I hate her pork chops.

22:56.786 --> 23:00.871
It's just the way she works,
always overthinking.

23:03.125 --> 23:05.559
You see two dogs?
There's no thinking.

23:05.594 --> 23:10.297
There's no "How are you feeling?
What am I feeling?" stuff.

23:10.299 --> 23:12.466
I understand
that could seem applicable

23:12.468 --> 23:14.601
if we were nothing more
than domesticated dogs.

23:14.637 --> 23:18.138
But aren't we?
I mean, really.

23:18.140 --> 23:21.975
I'm afraid that's not
only an oversimplification

23:22.027 --> 23:23.477
but a dangerous one.

23:23.479 --> 23:25.646
Can I ask you something?

23:25.648 --> 23:27.231
Of course.

23:27.283 --> 23:33.487
If you were me,
would you be concerned...

23:33.522 --> 23:37.157
with being asked to open up
a gorilla exhibit?

23:39.245 --> 23:40.994
I don't think I'm following.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.362
It's why we're here.

23:42.398 --> 23:45.065
I got asked to open
a gorilla exhibit at the zoo.

23:45.101 --> 23:49.236
There's that famous ape,
Gil the Gorilla...?

23:49.271 --> 23:51.238
I fail to see
how this has anything to do

23:51.273 --> 23:52.539
with you and your wife.

23:52.575 --> 23:54.041
I get paid double
if she appears with me.

23:54.076 --> 23:58.479
So, she said
she'd go to the ape house

23:58.514 --> 24:02.015
if I... agreed to come here.

24:02.051 --> 24:03.851
Mr. Neely...

24:03.886 --> 24:05.786
the only reason
I care you're here

24:05.821 --> 24:08.856
is because of you and your
wife's current sexual situation.

24:08.924 --> 24:12.359
Anything outside of that
is not my concern.

24:12.394 --> 24:15.996
Point taken, Doc.

24:16.031 --> 24:18.916
But in the spirit
of not pulling punches...

24:18.951 --> 24:21.869
I'm not the one
with the problem.

24:21.921 --> 24:23.203
The problem is Al.

24:23.239 --> 24:26.039
He's the lowdown,
ass-sniffing dog.

24:26.091 --> 24:29.927
Mrs. Neely,
when you asked for our help,

24:29.962 --> 24:32.546
the problem you presented
was sexual,

24:32.548 --> 24:35.098
but these allegations
of infidelity,

24:35.134 --> 24:37.651
they make it more difficult--
"Allegations"?

24:37.686 --> 24:39.303
My husband will screw anything

24:39.388 --> 24:41.388
that walks, winks,
or sits to pee.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.725
When I was filming "Johnny Reno"
with Jane Russell,

24:44.777 --> 24:47.728
I didn't have to buy perfume
for eight weeks

24:47.730 --> 24:51.064
'cause whatever she was wearing
ended up all over our sheets.

24:51.116 --> 24:53.951
Then there was Natalie Wood when
we were shooting "Penelope,"

24:53.986 --> 24:55.836
Shelley Winters
in "Patch Of Blue"...

24:55.871 --> 24:57.454
- Hell, even you.
- I'm sorry?

24:57.490 --> 24:59.907
You haven't seen the
way he's been looking at you?

25:01.877 --> 25:05.996
We have had great
success with struggling couples,

25:06.048 --> 25:09.466
but that's only when
both partners are committed

25:09.502 --> 25:12.002
to each other
and to the program.

25:12.054 --> 25:15.305
I'm committed.
We're committed.

25:15.341 --> 25:18.509
When we first met, there wasn't
any place we wouldn't make love.

25:18.561 --> 25:21.562
He once had me in a fountain
in Rome at 3:00 in the morning.

25:21.597 --> 25:23.180
Sober.

25:23.232 --> 25:26.817
All those coins
shifting under my feet...

25:26.852 --> 25:30.354
It was like we were gods, and
we could do whatever we pleased.

25:30.406 --> 25:32.673
Just the scent of him
and I would climax.

25:32.708 --> 25:33.574
But now...

25:33.609 --> 25:35.826
Now we can't go out for a burger

25:35.861 --> 25:39.029
without some waitress
leaning over his plate

25:39.081 --> 25:41.782
as though her tits
were on the menu.

25:41.817 --> 25:45.369
You want to know the real reason
that I can't come?

25:45.421 --> 25:46.753
Those other women.

25:46.789 --> 25:49.289
Why does he need them
when he has me?

25:49.291 --> 25:52.509
Do you know how many men would
give their right arm to have me?

25:52.545 --> 25:53.794
God, and I'm not talking

25:53.846 --> 25:56.179
about the Johnny Lunch buckets
of the world,

25:56.215 --> 25:58.966
but princes,
leading men, directors.

25:59.018 --> 26:01.051
And yet somehow, I'm the one

26:01.103 --> 26:04.771
who's made to feel like
some shriveled, old crone.

26:04.807 --> 26:06.807
I am asking you, right now,

26:06.809 --> 26:10.777
who on God's green earth
wouldn't want to fuck this?!

26:13.315 --> 26:15.899
The problem is, she's insane.

26:15.951 --> 26:18.902
I'm not saying
this case isn't a challenge...

26:18.954 --> 26:21.521
Landing on the Moon
is a challenge.

26:21.557 --> 26:23.490
Virginia, we can't choose cases

26:23.542 --> 26:24.908
based on degree of difficulty.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.159
That's not true.

26:26.211 --> 26:27.995
We've rejected couples
in the past.

26:27.997 --> 26:30.330
Based on a wide array
of circumstances

26:30.382 --> 26:33.000
outside our expertise,
but frigidity is our expertise.

26:33.002 --> 26:36.086
And I feel strongly
that there are core problems

26:36.138 --> 26:38.839
between this couple that
are beyond our skill set,

26:38.891 --> 26:41.725
meaning our time could be better
spent doing anything

26:41.760 --> 26:44.311
rather than going down
with this sinking ship.

26:44.346 --> 26:46.930
It is not a good idea
to alienate this community

26:46.982 --> 26:48.181
by dumping these patients.

26:48.183 --> 26:49.349
What community?

26:49.401 --> 26:51.852
The one that gets you
50-yard-line tickets?

26:51.854 --> 26:54.087
The community that pays $3,000

26:54.156 --> 26:56.223
for two weeks
of our expert advice.

26:56.258 --> 26:57.457
They agreed to that number?

26:57.493 --> 26:58.825
Betty's
already cashed the check.

27:01.363 --> 27:03.030
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

27:03.082 --> 27:05.082
- Yes, actually...
- Not at all.

27:05.117 --> 27:07.417
Anyway, I'm ready
in the exam room.

27:07.453 --> 27:08.869
Virginia, whenever you're ready.

27:08.921 --> 27:11.121
Actually, um,
I'll join you two today.

27:11.173 --> 27:14.541
You can... bring me up to speed.

27:22.351 --> 27:27.688
You know, there is one problem
I've managed to solve.

27:27.723 --> 27:31.458
Chancery Park Plaza Hotel.
9:00.

27:31.493 --> 27:36.897
Dr. and Mrs. Holden have
returned after a long absence.

27:42.705 --> 27:43.570
All right.

27:43.622 --> 27:45.155
I'm going to take
another reading.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.324
You gonna make me keep
pedaling until I pass out?

27:47.376 --> 27:49.493
We need as much sweat
as we can gather, Lester.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.745
It's suspected
human pheromones are secreted

27:51.747 --> 27:54.464
via perspiration by way of the
sweat glands, in the armpits--

27:54.500 --> 27:55.716
I know that's a theory.

27:55.751 --> 27:56.917
I wasn't aware

27:56.969 --> 27:58.585
there was empirical evidence
to support it.

27:58.637 --> 27:59.720
We're working on it.

27:59.755 --> 28:01.254
Are we?

28:01.256 --> 28:04.758
But the work we've done so far
is more or less theoretical?

28:04.810 --> 28:07.160
More or less.

28:07.196 --> 28:08.729
Look, I've made a fortune

28:08.764 --> 28:11.848
covering unpleasant smells
with lemon and perfume,

28:11.900 --> 28:14.868
but I have no idea how to market
the smell of...

28:14.903 --> 28:16.820
- Stink.
- Well, actually,

28:16.855 --> 28:18.822
what we're smelling
is Lester's bacteria.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.107
That's what's giving off

28:20.109 --> 28:22.209
this unpleasant
high school locker-room tang.

28:22.244 --> 28:23.610
You're welcome.

28:23.662 --> 28:26.496
And what we'll be
experimenting with, hopefully,

28:26.532 --> 28:27.831
is the subliminal scent.

28:27.866 --> 28:29.199
The smell behind the stink.

28:29.251 --> 28:32.002
The holy grail of attraction.

28:32.037 --> 28:34.538
Or...

28:34.590 --> 28:36.540
we can call it a "love potion."

28:36.592 --> 28:40.160
Exactly.
Better loving through chemistry.

28:40.195 --> 28:42.095
Although I'd hardly
call it chemistry.

28:42.131 --> 28:43.597
What would you call it, then?

28:43.632 --> 28:48.602
A trick, essentially.
I mean, isn't it a trick?

28:48.637 --> 28:50.470
You're trying
to manipulate a person

28:50.472 --> 28:51.972
into feeling a sexual attraction

28:52.024 --> 28:54.357
for someone whom they might not,
in actual fact,

28:54.393 --> 28:55.525
be attracted to at all.

28:55.561 --> 28:56.643
Or you could say

28:56.645 --> 28:58.645
I'm developing a product
customers want.

28:58.697 --> 28:59.780
I doubt many customers

28:59.815 --> 29:01.198
want to be duped
into falling in love.

29:01.283 --> 29:03.984
I think
what we all want is to uncover

29:03.986 --> 29:07.254
the essential link between scent
and human sexual response.

29:07.289 --> 29:09.372
Well, that might be
what we're interested in,

29:09.408 --> 29:11.742
Virginia, because our work is
the work of scientific inquiry,

29:11.794 --> 29:14.428
but I think Mr. Logan
has other interests.

29:14.463 --> 29:15.746
Yes. Yes, I do.

29:15.798 --> 29:18.381
I want to take nature's
guidelines for pointing us

29:18.417 --> 29:21.268
to the right mate and simply
give it a little boost.

29:21.303 --> 29:22.919
Nature doesn't need
a little boost.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.471
Nature can always be
improved upon.

29:24.506 --> 29:26.590
Well, she's done
just fine for millennia

29:26.642 --> 29:28.308
without the interference
of salesmen.

29:28.343 --> 29:29.676
She came up with polio,

29:29.678 --> 29:31.895
and science didn't have
a problem interfering with that.

29:31.930 --> 29:35.482
I think
that by taking our science

29:35.517 --> 29:38.985
and combining it
with Mr. Logan's commerce,

29:39.021 --> 29:42.622
what we're really doing here
is creating a happy marriage.

29:42.658 --> 29:43.990
I think I'm having a stroke.

29:45.911 --> 29:50.280
So what you might do
in a short-yardage situation,

29:50.332 --> 29:52.532
the quarterback takes the snap

29:52.584 --> 29:57.704
and then dives ahead
while the line charges forward.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.506
Okay?

29:59.541 --> 30:02.793
Now, there's not usually
much yardage gained like that,

30:02.845 --> 30:05.929
but Dennis did manage to get
7 yards out of it yesterday...

30:05.964 --> 30:07.314
Where have you been, Lib?

30:07.349 --> 30:09.115
I'm due back at work in an hour.

30:09.151 --> 30:12.285
Oh, I had to drop Jenny
off at her friend Karen's.

30:12.321 --> 30:14.638
Her mother was running late.

30:14.690 --> 30:15.555
Hi, you.

30:15.607 --> 30:17.057
What are you two up to?

30:17.109 --> 30:19.392
I was just showing Johnny

30:19.394 --> 30:22.979
how a quarterback sneak works.

30:23.031 --> 30:25.198
Are you playing
quarterback now?

30:25.234 --> 30:27.951
Um, something Dennis did
in the game yesterday.

30:27.986 --> 30:30.237
Dennis...?

30:30.289 --> 30:31.838
Dennis Daughtry.

30:31.874 --> 30:34.741
The boy playing
quarterback yesterday

30:34.743 --> 30:36.076
was Dennis Daughtry?

30:36.128 --> 30:39.212
I had no idea
he was on the team.

30:39.248 --> 30:40.947
Sure talked to him long enough.

30:40.983 --> 30:44.718
Well,
you're on the same side now.

30:44.753 --> 30:47.137
And I want it to go well.

30:47.172 --> 30:49.089
I'm gonna go read.

30:52.728 --> 30:54.561
It'll be all right.

30:54.596 --> 30:56.930
I'll be there
to make sure it is.

31:27.629 --> 31:28.795
Good evening.

31:28.847 --> 31:31.681
Good evening, Dr. Masters.

31:31.717 --> 31:33.016
I would just like to say

31:33.051 --> 31:35.802
that we are very honored
to have you at our hotel.

31:35.804 --> 31:39.139
The wife brought home your book
and just having it in the house

31:39.141 --> 31:42.225
has put some real pizzazz
into things.

31:42.277 --> 31:45.278
And Mrs. Johnson is with you.

31:45.314 --> 31:46.696
Oh, lovely.

31:46.732 --> 31:49.816
So, how can I be of assistance?

31:49.818 --> 31:52.452
Mrs. Johnson and I are...

31:52.487 --> 31:56.823
uh, on our way to a symposium.

31:56.875 --> 32:00.160
We need to pay for our drinks.
We can't locate a waiter.

32:00.212 --> 32:01.628
Consider it taken care of.

32:01.663 --> 32:04.331
Thank you.
That's very generous.

32:15.978 --> 32:19.262
We can't stay here.

32:19.314 --> 32:20.814
He recognized us?

32:25.821 --> 32:29.990
Well...
Where do we go now?

32:35.430 --> 32:38.398
Well, I have
to hand it to you, Virginia.

32:38.433 --> 32:42.435
You've turned this into
a very pleasant and inviting--

32:42.471 --> 32:45.672
Lab.

32:45.707 --> 32:47.140
It is a lab, Bill.

32:47.175 --> 32:50.377
Far cry from silk sheets
and room service.

32:50.412 --> 32:52.178
All right, but...

32:52.214 --> 32:56.182
hotels are out since the book
has now made us recognizable.

32:56.218 --> 32:58.518
We can't use your house
because your parents appear

32:58.553 --> 33:00.270
to have taken up
permanent residence.

33:00.355 --> 33:03.273
I guess there's always the car.

33:03.308 --> 33:05.725
You know, the point
of this evening

33:05.777 --> 33:08.895
was not to make you sigh--
in despair, anyway.

33:08.897 --> 33:12.782
It's like we've been
forced back to ground zero.

33:12.818 --> 33:15.735
Another version of the Wash U
lab where we first had sex.

33:15.787 --> 33:18.705
"Ground zero" makes it
sound unnecessarily grim.

33:18.740 --> 33:21.324
Starting
a relationship in a lab

33:21.376 --> 33:23.076
is hardly a proper courtship.

33:23.128 --> 33:27.330
We had a courtship.
We did.

33:27.382 --> 33:32.619
Unorthodox, by most standards,
but we definitely had one.

33:32.654 --> 33:34.187
We had a negotiation.

33:34.222 --> 33:39.426
And then we hooked ourselves up
to wires

33:39.428 --> 33:44.597
while we talked each other
through the stages of arousal.

33:44.649 --> 33:48.268
Nature was not
why we got together, Bill.

33:48.353 --> 33:50.320
Work was.

33:50.355 --> 33:56.910
Well, I can assure you
that nature played a part.

33:57.979 --> 34:00.830
Yes, but do you ever...

34:00.866 --> 34:03.616
Do you ever wonder
what it might've been like

34:03.618 --> 34:05.201
if we had met differently?

34:05.253 --> 34:09.621
At a dinner party,

34:09.623 --> 34:12.292
sitting on opposite ends
of the table...

34:12.344 --> 34:15.962
And how, if the whole evening,
people were talking to us,

34:16.014 --> 34:18.264
but we were only half listening

34:18.300 --> 34:21.101
because we were drawn
to each other.

34:21.136 --> 34:23.969
That's not a courtship.

34:23.972 --> 34:27.690
That's a schoolgirl fantasy.

34:27.726 --> 34:30.360
Besides, I think it's unfair

34:30.395 --> 34:33.897
that romantic
circumstances alone

34:33.949 --> 34:36.616
define what is considered
a natural courtship.

34:36.650 --> 34:38.260
Let's be honest, Bill.

34:38.261 --> 34:42.661
What we had was about as natural
as two amoeba in a Petri dish.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.128
Tessie...

34:56.007 --> 34:57.729
Your hair looks like...

34:57.855 --> 35:00.556
It exploded?
I know.

35:00.558 --> 35:02.724
Grandma.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.610
The hair spray's
making me nauseous.

35:04.645 --> 35:07.112
Well, then you
should wash it out, honey.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.230
I don't know.

35:08.232 --> 35:09.898
This whole thing
seems so important to her.

35:09.934 --> 35:11.817
My goodness, Mary Virginia,

35:11.869 --> 35:13.785
the hours you keep

35:13.821 --> 35:15.787
I thought Tessa
was exaggerating,

35:15.823 --> 35:17.005
but apparently not.

35:20.828 --> 35:23.245
I'm just wondering
if Bill kept you out so late.

35:23.297 --> 35:24.880
Because if that's so, then may--

35:24.915 --> 35:27.833
How dare you give
Tessa that preposterous hairdo.

35:27.885 --> 35:29.351
What did you tell her?

35:29.386 --> 35:31.587
That she looks pretty--
prettier?

35:31.622 --> 35:33.055
I think she does look pretty.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.856
She looks
like a stovetop scrubber.

35:34.892 --> 35:36.258
She looks like Miss America.

35:36.310 --> 35:37.726
And what's wrong with that?

35:37.761 --> 35:40.613
You certainly were one for
the pageants back in the day.

35:40.614 --> 35:43.361
Don't talk to me about those pageants.
I hated those pageants.

35:43.368 --> 35:45.835
Well, if that's how you
choose to remember it, fine.

35:45.837 --> 35:47.170
All I'm doing is trying to have

35:47.172 --> 35:48.888
a relationship
with my granddaughter,

35:48.924 --> 35:50.590
which is what that girl
really needs.

35:51.342 --> 35:53.008
That's why I'm here, honey.

35:53.044 --> 35:55.878
I'm here to take care of you
and Tessa and--

35:55.913 --> 35:58.380
But you don't take care of me!

35:58.382 --> 36:00.633
You belittle me!
And you criticize me!

36:00.685 --> 36:01.884
You know what?

36:01.919 --> 36:04.470
Whether you like it or not,
I am your mother.

36:04.522 --> 36:07.022
And Tessa is our chance
to finally get this right.

36:07.058 --> 36:09.191
Don't you bring Tessa into this.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.559
You don't mean that.

36:10.611 --> 36:12.895
I have never meant
anything more.

36:17.235 --> 36:18.734
Mm.

36:25.110 --> 36:27.060
Don't you know

36:27.112 --> 36:30.897
that all I've ever wanted
was... your approval?

36:34.402 --> 36:40.456
For you to just be proud of me
with no strings attached?

36:40.492 --> 36:44.377
But you can't do it, can you?!

36:47.165 --> 36:50.500
That's fine.

36:50.552 --> 36:52.802
Because it's too late for us,

36:52.837 --> 36:56.973
but I will not let you
take my daughter and twist her

36:57.008 --> 37:00.760
into some version of herself
that she will come to loathe.

37:00.812 --> 37:05.898
Oh.
I make you feel horrible?

37:05.934 --> 37:09.519
Isn't that a little bit like
blaming the messenger, hmm?

37:09.554 --> 37:12.121
I can love you, Mary Virginia,

37:12.157 --> 37:15.525
and I can still
tell you the truth.

37:15.577 --> 37:17.860
Why is it you can't hear it?

37:22.250 --> 37:23.950
It's a small leak,
but it's steady.

37:24.002 --> 37:25.201
Uh-huh.

37:25.236 --> 37:27.036
Do you want some coffee?
I just made some.

37:27.088 --> 37:28.788
I'm good, thanks.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.039
It's funny.

37:30.091 --> 37:32.959
For years, I've been making
coffee for two,

37:33.011 --> 37:35.962
and I haven't quite mastered
the half pot.

37:36.014 --> 37:37.347
Seems obvious, you know?

37:37.382 --> 37:39.098
Half the water, half the coffee,

37:39.134 --> 37:42.518
and yet it's either too weak
or too bitter.

37:42.554 --> 37:47.533
Yet somehow the highlight
of my day is this kitchen table,

37:47.534 --> 37:50.412
this chair and that first sip.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.869
Washer's bent.

37:52.870 --> 37:56.622
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
grab another one from dowtairs.

37:56.674 --> 37:59.374
So, you and the hubby
are split, then?

37:59.376 --> 38:03.712
Uh... yeah,
I'm, uh... I'm afraid so.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.514
Yeah?
You have any kids?

38:05.549 --> 38:08.550
Um, yeah.

38:08.552 --> 38:11.320
I do. I have three
beautiful children.

38:11.355 --> 38:13.605
Yeah, that's what I
most regret about my divorce--

38:13.641 --> 38:15.724
what happened with my kids.

38:15.759 --> 38:20.649
Nothing bad
is gonna happen to my kids.

38:20.865 --> 38:23.431
I have made sure of it.

38:23.432 --> 38:25.357
Well, you are a miracle
worker then.

38:25.954 --> 38:29.288
Oh, yeah.
I checked up on your lease,

38:29.324 --> 38:32.041
and you're paid up
for six months, so...

38:32.076 --> 38:35.912
enjoy your stay here...
Mrs. Edley.

38:50.867 --> 38:54.360
You need to re-do
these forms, Mr. Neely.

38:54.361 --> 38:58.647
Your one-word, perfunctory answers
are not going to cut it.

38:59.772 --> 39:02.773
I was never very good
with tests.

39:02.775 --> 39:05.976
Always got distracted
by girls like you.

39:06.012 --> 39:07.778
Right.

39:07.830 --> 39:10.114
Start with number 12, please.

39:12.360 --> 39:13.390
Mmh.

39:13.391 --> 39:16.060
What form of contraception
have you used?

39:16.061 --> 39:17.417
You wrote "Television".

39:17.423 --> 39:19.323
Always 100% effective.

39:19.675 --> 39:24.162
I will be back
to collect your answers shortly.

39:30.070 --> 39:31.970
It's warm.

39:31.971 --> 39:35.222
Well, we find
it makes penetration easier.

39:35.223 --> 39:38.153
And you watch?
From behind the glass?

39:38.188 --> 39:39.310
I do.

39:39.312 --> 39:42.112
We just want to rule out
any physical problems

39:42.148 --> 39:45.065
that may be preventing you
from achieving orgasm.

39:47.703 --> 39:51.388
Then I guess I'll just
wait for you to yell, "Action."

39:51.424 --> 39:53.900
Good. Let's get started.

39:57.901 --> 39:59.261
Anything?

39:59.262 --> 40:01.668
Thoughts? Feelings?

40:02.218 --> 40:05.169
I need to pick up
some tide on my way home?

40:05.221 --> 40:08.139
You're sure?
No arousal or...?

40:08.174 --> 40:10.341
Sorry.

40:10.343 --> 40:12.844
Smells like
my old boyfriend's hamper.

40:12.896 --> 40:15.680
All right.
Thank you, Beth.

40:15.682 --> 40:18.015
Lester's sweat
strikes out again.

40:18.017 --> 40:19.517
I'm starting to lose hope.

40:19.569 --> 40:22.687
Well, I wouldn't yet.

40:25.024 --> 40:26.491
See these spikes?

40:26.526 --> 40:28.075
Mm-hmm.

40:28.111 --> 40:29.475
Her mouth's saying, "No,"

40:29.574 --> 40:32.831
but her vagina says, "Yes."

40:39.832 --> 40:41.874
How did I do?

40:41.882 --> 40:47.024
You achieved orgasm
at 54 seconds.

40:47.025 --> 40:49.056
54 seconds?

40:49.057 --> 40:53.169
So I'm not frigid after all?

41:04.327 --> 41:07.953
Skin flush, blotches apparent
on the neck and back,

41:07.954 --> 41:09.454
nipples erect and

41:09.569 --> 41:11.569
the beginnings
of vaginal lubrication.

41:11.621 --> 41:13.571
Yet they all insist
that they're not aroused,

41:13.623 --> 41:15.239
that they find
Lester's smell repugnant.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.074
There's something
in that stinky sweat

41:17.126 --> 41:18.459
that keeps drawing
these women in.

41:18.494 --> 41:19.627
Mm.

41:19.662 --> 41:22.663
Obviously, being alone in here,

41:22.715 --> 41:24.081
minus distractions,

41:24.167 --> 41:27.718
allowed you to relax,
let nature take its course.

41:27.754 --> 41:31.922
You are leaving out
one very attentive...

41:31.975 --> 41:34.692
and handsome variable.

41:34.727 --> 41:38.229
Uh...

41:38.264 --> 41:44.935
that, uh... "Variable" is what's
commonly known as transference.

41:44.988 --> 41:47.655
It's a perfectly normal
phenomenon that can occur

41:47.690 --> 41:50.324
during the course
of a therapeutic relationship.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.694
Rest assured, what you felt can
easily be explained by science.

41:53.746 --> 41:56.831
Dr. Masters...

41:56.866 --> 42:01.369
what you call science,
most would call chemistry.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.374
You feel that?
Not bad, though, right?

42:06.426 --> 42:07.591
You can move it.

42:07.627 --> 42:09.510
Johnny, what happened?

42:09.545 --> 42:11.178
Well, the game ended,
and you weren't there,

42:11.214 --> 42:12.296
so I took Johnny home myself.

42:12.298 --> 42:13.631
But what happened to his leg?

42:13.633 --> 42:15.132
He just ended up
on the wrong end of a pile-up.

42:15.184 --> 42:16.517
He strained his ankle is all.
He's fine.

42:16.552 --> 42:18.102
Got two tackles today, mom.

42:18.137 --> 42:19.270
You missed it.

42:19.305 --> 42:20.855
Two tackles,
and now you're hurt.

42:20.890 --> 42:22.807
- Where is your father?
- He missed it, too.

42:22.809 --> 42:23.941
Apparently, Bill had to work,

42:23.976 --> 42:25.393
so I was coaching alone today.

42:25.445 --> 42:26.811
So no one was paying
attention when Johnny got hurt?

42:26.863 --> 42:28.079
It's a contact sport, Libby.

42:28.114 --> 42:29.230
It's how it works.

42:29.282 --> 42:31.399
Here, stand up, Johnny.
He's all right.

42:31.451 --> 42:32.583
I'm fine.

42:32.618 --> 42:34.819
There, see?
He's fine.

42:34.871 --> 42:35.953
It's just a bruise--

42:35.988 --> 42:37.405
He's not fine!
He is limping!

42:37.457 --> 42:38.622
And soon, he won't be.

42:38.658 --> 42:40.041
I'm gonna have a doctor
look at him.

42:40.076 --> 42:41.325
Libby,
he doesn't need a doctor.

42:41.377 --> 42:42.460
He just needs to walk it off,

42:42.495 --> 42:43.544
and tomorrow morning,
he'll be fine.

42:43.579 --> 42:45.496
Mom, I'm okay.

42:45.548 --> 42:48.065
That's it.
There is no more football.

42:48.101 --> 42:49.500
But I have a game tomorrow.

42:49.535 --> 42:50.501
And you won't be in it.

42:50.503 --> 42:51.569
You are retiring, starting now.

42:53.072 --> 42:54.472
Why are you looking
at Coach Edley?

42:54.507 --> 42:55.639
Because I want to play.

42:55.675 --> 42:56.924
And I am your mother,

42:56.976 --> 42:58.259
and I am telling you,
you are done with playing.

42:58.311 --> 43:01.762
Uh, Johnny,
why don't you go get cleaned up,

43:01.814 --> 43:03.848
give your mom and me a moment?

43:10.356 --> 43:11.655
Can I be honest, Libby?

43:11.691 --> 43:13.657
You can't smother a boy
like that.

43:13.693 --> 43:16.026
And I'm sure Bill would agree.

43:16.079 --> 43:18.529
Oh, so now
you and Bill both think

43:18.531 --> 43:20.197
that I am "smothering" my son.

43:20.249 --> 43:21.582
Well, he did mention

43:21.617 --> 43:23.033
that you weren't keen
on Johnny joining the team.

43:23.035 --> 43:24.118
But it's good for him.

43:24.170 --> 43:25.953
And I'll tell you
what's not good for him

43:26.038 --> 43:27.788
is you yanking him away
from the game,

43:27.840 --> 43:30.174
depriving him of the chance
to work through the pain,

43:30.209 --> 43:32.710
to learn how to be a man instead
of you mollycoddling him.

43:32.712 --> 43:35.930
Oh. You don't believe
in mollycoddling.

43:35.965 --> 43:37.298
No, I absolutely do not,

43:37.350 --> 43:39.216
and I strongly urge you
to change your position here.

43:39.252 --> 43:40.634
So you think everyone

43:40.686 --> 43:42.386
should just take their medicine
straight, is that it?

43:42.388 --> 43:45.439
Or is my "mollycoddling" you
the exception?

43:45.475 --> 43:47.892
Me? What do I have to do
with any of this?

43:47.944 --> 43:50.778
I'm talking about
your wife, how she was drowning,

43:50.813 --> 43:53.097
how suffocated she felt
by your life together--

43:53.132 --> 43:55.032
how unhappy she was.

43:55.067 --> 43:57.485
Libby,
if this is some sort of--

43:57.537 --> 44:00.571
Joy had an apartment.
She was one foot out the door.

44:00.573 --> 44:04.208
As far as she was concerned,
your marriage was over.

44:04.243 --> 44:07.244
There.

44:07.296 --> 44:10.581
No more mollycoddling
for anyone.

44:26.065 --> 44:27.164
Paul...

44:33.990 --> 44:37.358
Mrs. Johnson and I
have been talking,

44:37.410 --> 44:40.911
and we have pinpointed
some possible impediments

44:40.947 --> 44:42.329
to your treatment here.

44:42.365 --> 44:44.448
Infidelity, for starters.

44:44.450 --> 44:48.285
A certain lack of commitment
to our process.

44:48.337 --> 44:51.922
A propensity on both
your parts to focus on others

44:51.958 --> 44:54.191
as potential
romantic attachments.

44:54.227 --> 44:57.127
We're public figures.
We're paid to be charming.

44:57.180 --> 44:58.679
That doesn't mean

44:58.714 --> 45:00.681
we're not committed
to fixing our marriage.

45:00.716 --> 45:03.133
All right.

45:03.186 --> 45:08.806
Let's talk about one particular
question on our intake forms.

45:08.858 --> 45:13.611
"What attracted you most to your
spouse when you first met?"

45:13.646 --> 45:15.646
What did you write
for that, Mrs. Neely?

45:15.648 --> 45:23.070
That I was attracted
by Al's smile and body and...

45:23.155 --> 45:25.829
the way he came up to me
at the Brown derby--

45:25.943 --> 45:30.928
didn't even know me--
and said, "I want you."

45:30.963 --> 45:34.098
And how did you answer
that question, Mr. Neely?

45:35.868 --> 45:38.302
I don't know.
Probably some smart-ass answer.

45:38.337 --> 45:40.271
That's what I thought, too.

45:40.306 --> 45:44.174
At first.
But then I reread it.

45:44.176 --> 45:46.176
"What attracted you most?"

45:46.178 --> 45:49.179
And you wrote,
"She was 20 feet tall."

45:49.232 --> 45:54.184
I told you.
It's a smart-ass answer.

45:54.186 --> 45:56.253
But what did that even mean?

45:56.289 --> 45:58.556
Nothing.

45:58.591 --> 46:00.991
Just...

46:01.027 --> 46:03.994
the first time I met Isabella...

46:04.030 --> 46:10.334
I was sitting in a dark theater
with a bunch of other men...

46:10.369 --> 46:15.539
watching... lusting...

46:15.541 --> 46:20.761
knowing that was as close
as they'd ever get to her.

46:20.796 --> 46:25.316
But for me,
Isabella was within reach.

46:25.351 --> 46:30.054
I knew that woman up there
on that screen,

46:30.106 --> 46:33.023
on all those magazine covers...

46:33.059 --> 46:35.893
the one that did Perry Como...

46:35.895 --> 46:38.362
I knew she didn't have to vanish
when the lights went up.

46:38.397 --> 46:41.231
I could have her.

46:41.284 --> 46:45.819
Al, I was more
than some... conquest.

46:45.871 --> 46:48.072
I felt it.
I was there, too.

46:48.124 --> 46:51.041
And that first night
at the derby,

46:51.077 --> 46:55.179
all I wanted was to have you
right then and there.

46:55.214 --> 46:57.631
Yes, that's how I felt, too.

46:57.667 --> 46:59.850
And then what happened?

47:03.172 --> 47:09.510
After we'd...
been together awhile...

47:09.562 --> 47:16.900
I started thinking about...
that woman up on the screen...

47:16.936 --> 47:23.490
wishing that I had her...

47:23.526 --> 47:26.577
and not the real version
sitting beside me.

47:26.612 --> 47:28.996
Al...

47:29.031 --> 47:31.749
why are you being so cruel?

47:31.784 --> 47:36.754
What's cruel...

47:36.789 --> 47:39.490
is that I never told you that.

47:48.634 --> 47:50.200
Well, you were right.

47:50.236 --> 47:52.503
They were doomed the moment
they came in.

48:11.791 --> 48:13.824
You've got to be kidding me.

48:13.876 --> 48:15.492
Why not in an elevator?

48:15.528 --> 48:16.877
Or in a car?

48:16.912 --> 48:18.996
Or in the middle of a damn
field, if we feel like it...

48:19.048 --> 48:21.832
Do you feel like it?
After that?

48:24.170 --> 48:26.053
None of this would be an issue

48:26.088 --> 48:28.005
if you'd just ask your parents
to leave.

48:28.057 --> 48:30.841
I did.
They'll be gone by tomorrow.

48:32.928 --> 48:35.763
Look, wait.
It wasn't just work.

48:35.815 --> 48:40.184
Your dinner?
The crowded table?

48:40.186 --> 48:42.903
The intoxicating conversation?
We had that.

48:44.857 --> 48:49.743
The moment you walked
into my office.

48:49.779 --> 48:54.732
I will never forget the first
time I ever saw you, Virginia.

48:54.767 --> 48:58.202
I was standing by the elevator
in Maternity.

48:58.204 --> 49:01.955
And I turned,
and there you were...

49:02.007 --> 49:04.308
behind the glass.

49:04.343 --> 49:09.046
And, granted, we were surrounded
by patients and secretaries

49:09.098 --> 49:13.383
and the hospital loud speaker
squawking down the hall,

49:13.436 --> 49:17.054
but just to dismiss that
as only work...

49:17.106 --> 49:22.226
Well, that's a fairy tale, too.

49:22.278 --> 49:26.230
We would have found each other
at that party.

49:26.232 --> 49:28.398
We would have stayed
by each other's side.

49:28.451 --> 49:31.034
We would have found a way
to see each other again.

49:35.958 --> 49:39.576
Maybe we would have.

49:44.583 --> 49:50.053
But then again,
we'll never know.

50:03.102 --> 50:04.768
I should warn you...

50:04.820 --> 50:08.689
your husband is waiting
in your apartment.

50:08.741 --> 50:11.024
Thank you.

50:38.604 --> 50:41.171
Come on.
Go past--

50:48.848 --> 50:52.616
Dennis?
What are you...

50:54.820 --> 50:56.153
- It's after 9:00.
- I know.

50:56.205 --> 51:00.741
I was just... wondering
why you didn't coach today.

51:00.793 --> 51:02.259
You didn't quit, did you?

51:02.294 --> 51:05.412
No.
No, I-- I didn't quit.

51:05.464 --> 51:06.630
Does your mother know
you're here?

51:06.665 --> 51:08.165
My mom's out.

51:08.217 --> 51:10.751
Is she working?

51:10.803 --> 51:12.219
Just out.

51:12.254 --> 51:16.139
Uh, I'm, uh, watching the game.

51:16.175 --> 51:17.374
You want to come in?

51:21.263 --> 51:23.180
And you can give me my football.

51:38.197 --> 51:40.197
Well, I thought you'd left.

51:40.199 --> 51:41.365
I had.

51:41.367 --> 51:43.200
But then I-- I remembered--

51:43.252 --> 51:45.752
You remembered
we had a good day

51:45.788 --> 51:47.537
and made some real progress.

51:49.708 --> 51:52.926
Well, we're not quite there yet.

51:52.962 --> 51:55.245
That was a very small sampling.

51:55.281 --> 52:01.551
To the love potion inside
sweat that makes poets write,

52:01.553 --> 52:04.221
artists paint,
and turns a walk in the dark

52:04.223 --> 52:05.689
into a moonlight stroll.

52:05.724 --> 52:08.475
Are you hearing the zing
of your heartstrings?

52:08.527 --> 52:09.893
Not exactly.

52:11.063 --> 52:12.696
But then again,

52:12.731 --> 52:15.399
I'm not wired up
to monitoring equipment,

52:15.401 --> 52:17.367
so perhaps
I am feeling something

52:17.403 --> 52:18.568
but I'm just unaware.

52:18.621 --> 52:21.071
You never wired
yourself up, you and Bill?

52:22.908 --> 52:25.909
No.
We never wired ourselves.

52:25.961 --> 52:27.077
Mm.

52:27.112 --> 52:29.212
Then let's do
a little experiment.

52:29.248 --> 52:31.214
What kind of experiment?

52:31.250 --> 52:33.917
Well, I'm still having
a hard time believing

52:33.919 --> 52:36.086
that a person's body
can respond sexually

52:36.138 --> 52:37.554
without the person knowing.

52:37.589 --> 52:39.756
We're not moths.

52:39.808 --> 52:44.594
Maybe people need to be
inches away from each other,

52:44.647 --> 52:47.130
which is why God
invented dancing.

52:51.353 --> 52:53.020
This is hardly an experiment

52:53.072 --> 52:55.906
that would stand up
to any scientific standard.

52:55.941 --> 52:59.326
It's a good thing
I'm not a scientist.

52:59.361 --> 53:02.779
But do you feel anything?

53:02.781 --> 53:06.116
Any kind of, as you would say,
physiological response?

53:06.151 --> 53:08.618
I don't.

53:08.620 --> 53:11.338
Mm. Me neither.

53:11.373 --> 53:15.292
But then again...

53:15.344 --> 53:17.761
it's just what's happening
on the surface.

53:17.796 --> 53:20.130
As we learned today,
we don't really know

53:20.182 --> 53:23.517
what's happening
in the... nether regions.

53:23.552 --> 53:25.218
Is that your technical term?

53:25.270 --> 53:26.853
Your pudenda.

53:26.889 --> 53:29.139
No, that's too technical.

53:29.191 --> 53:33.210
It's really nice
to see you laugh, Virginia.

53:39.234 --> 53:41.651
You still don't feel anything?

53:41.653 --> 53:44.371
No.

53:44.406 --> 53:47.624
Mm.

53:47.659 --> 53:50.410
Still?

53:53.298 --> 53:55.048
Still nothing.

54:00.723 --> 54:05.592
1933 football
stars set, mint condition.

54:05.644 --> 54:09.012
Took me two years to put
together the whole collection.

54:09.064 --> 54:10.597
That is so cool.

54:10.649 --> 54:13.433
I got a half collection
from '64 somewhere.

54:13.485 --> 54:14.851
Yeah?

54:14.903 --> 54:19.256
Things get lost a lot
at my house.

54:19.324 --> 54:21.241
You know, I'll tell you what.

54:21.326 --> 54:25.445
You, uh...
you pick out any card you like,

54:25.497 --> 54:28.498
and, uh... just give me
the stats,

54:28.534 --> 54:32.169
and I will give you a quarter
for any one I don't get.

54:32.204 --> 54:35.922
Okay, go ahead.
Any one you like.

54:35.958 --> 54:39.292
Just the stats.

54:39.344 --> 54:40.927
- You got one?
- Yes.

54:40.963 --> 54:42.796
Go ahead.

54:42.848 --> 54:46.149
1932, four touchdowns...

55:29.144 --> 55:33.396
Tessa...
it's almost midnight.

55:33.432 --> 55:35.015
Unless we're
in different time zones,

55:35.067 --> 55:36.099
it's midnight for you, too.

55:36.135 --> 55:38.468
Yes, but I'm not up by choice.

55:38.504 --> 55:39.369
I had to work.

55:39.404 --> 55:41.705
I like your hair.

55:41.740 --> 55:44.941
Took four washes
and a bottle of mayonnaise,

55:44.943 --> 55:46.710
but I got it back to normal.

55:46.745 --> 55:48.945
Well, you look pretty.

55:48.981 --> 55:50.814
You-- you look like you.

55:54.219 --> 55:56.670
What are you reading?

55:56.705 --> 55:59.339
There's a really
interesting article

55:59.374 --> 56:02.626
in "Teen Society" this month
that I wanted to show you.

56:02.628 --> 56:06.546
Oh?
What's it about?

56:06.598 --> 56:08.465
Well, I, um...

56:13.472 --> 56:15.689
It's nothing important.

56:15.724 --> 56:17.140
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

56:17.192 --> 56:18.875
No, honey. Show me.

56:18.911 --> 56:21.111
Tomorrow, okay?

56:21.146 --> 56:24.948
Okay.

56:24.983 --> 56:28.451
- Good night.
- Good night.

56:37.829 --> 56:40.330
Turns out your Hollywood couple

56:40.332 --> 56:42.332
wasn't a complete waste of time.

56:42.334 --> 56:44.417
It already led to one referral.

56:49.675 --> 56:52.893
We know it's probably
not your normal case, but, uh...

56:52.928 --> 56:56.012
well, we just don't know
where else to turn.

56:56.064 --> 56:59.566
I mean, it's as if he's lost
all interest in girls.

56:59.601 --> 57:05.288
I mean,
they're animals, after all.
