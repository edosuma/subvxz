WEBVTT

00:11.315 --> 00:14.101
And that was the
last time you two had sex?

00:14.144 --> 00:15.624
-Pretty much.
-Yes.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.234
Mm-mm-mm.

00:19.410 --> 00:22.065
Sorry, it's not something
I find terribly comfortable

00:22.109 --> 00:23.675
talking about,
given my upbringing.

00:23.719 --> 00:27.244
Oh, no, it's OK,
it's OK, take your time.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.899
Perhaps I have been
compartmentalizing things a bit

00:29.942 --> 00:31.988
since we got married,
including Elliott.

00:32.031 --> 00:36.166
-Or is that over-rationalizing?
-No, no, no, that's good.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.950
I don't know
why it's happened.

00:37.994 --> 00:41.171
I still think he's attractive,
but I just don't feel

00:41.215 --> 00:44.566
attractive around him,
if that makes any sense.

00:44.609 --> 00:49.179
Has this lapse
in your, um, intimacy levels

00:49.223 --> 00:51.877
coincided with any
decrease in libido?

00:51.921 --> 00:54.619
Oh, no, I still have
a very healthy sex drive.

00:56.926 --> 00:59.972
Let's just say I do all right.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.801
What would you describe as "all right?"

01:02.845 --> 01:07.719
Uh, well, I haven't gotten
any complaints from the others.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.634
-Oh, others.
-Other men.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.636
Oh, so you're not monogamous?

01:11.680 --> 01:15.118
Oh, no, it's OK, Elliott
and I have an open marriage.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.815
We have an open what now?

01:16.859 --> 01:18.687
Elliott, I've explained the procedure.

01:18.730 --> 01:23.170
We let Allison speak,
and then it's your turn.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.607
Then it's your turn.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.523
Ah, ah. Elliott?

01:29.611 --> 01:30.655
Thank you.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.702
Allison?

01:33.745 --> 01:37.358
Elliott seems a bit surprised
by this new information.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.882
How does his reaction
make you feel?

You know,
I think that I would have

02:07.736 --> 02:09.912
remembered had
we discussed it.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.479
How open are we
talking about here?

02:11.522 --> 02:13.133
-Like, are you out there, like--
-Yeah, I don't think

02:13.176 --> 02:14.743
we should talk about this
away from Dr. Rios.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.614
Oh, that guy's a doctor
like I'm a fucking Laker girl.

03:33.430 --> 03:36.912
-OK.
-What is the title
of this masterpiece?

03:36.955 --> 03:40.959
So, it's a
newswoman-turned-soccer-mom?

03:43.745 --> 03:46.051
Someone's murdered, and then
the soccer coach is murdered,

03:46.095 --> 03:47.618
and then she becomes
a soccer-mom?

03:47.662 --> 03:49.490
No, she gave up--

03:49.533 --> 03:51.709
-Everyone, OK?
-Everybody got it?

03:51.753 --> 03:53.537
-Here we go.
-Right!

03:53.581 --> 03:55.626
- Yeah, I like the shimmy.
-That's a British thing.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.106
It is.

03:57.149 --> 04:00.588
So, is the title
Passion on the Field?

04:00.631 --> 04:02.764
Oh, no, that
sounds really good.

04:02.807 --> 04:06.550
Black Victims, White Justice:
The Maddie Monroe Story?

04:06.594 --> 04:09.771
Oh, that seems way
very much like that--

04:09.814 --> 04:12.164
That's almost too topical.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.731
Inspector Mom?

04:13.775 --> 04:16.125
Inspector Mom?

04:16.168 --> 04:17.605
Nowhere near it.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.781
"How many of these
guys have you fucked?"

04:22.087 --> 04:23.437
That's a weird title.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.221
That doesn't sound like that.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.049
-That doesn't make any sense.
-That's not--

04:27.092 --> 04:31.314
I feel like, you know,
Lifetime show, Wednesday at 8PM.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.186
I feel like they have
a line that they don't cross.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.848
Anyway, so,
Inspector Mom, you're right!
-Didn't like Inspector Mom.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.589
-That's the title?
-That's the title!

04:49.463 --> 04:51.247
If you didn't want a game night,
you could have said.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.945
It's fine, I had fun.

04:53.989 --> 04:57.297
I think I need some privacy
tonight, if you don't mind.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.863
Oh, my God, really?

05:58.445 --> 06:00.925
Sleep OK?

06:00.969 --> 06:06.235
Hey, have you been hearing
these birds around the house,
sound like old car alarms?

06:06.278 --> 06:08.411
And what do
old car alarms sound like?

06:08.455 --> 06:11.675
You know,
like car alarms.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.938
I think this might be one of
those American-British things

06:13.982 --> 06:16.071
we won't be able to reconcile.

06:19.596 --> 06:22.512
Well, so we should
talk about this.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.384
-Should we?
-I'm so sorry, pudding.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.733
It's just, it's really
hard to explain.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.212
Well, you didn't seem to
have any trouble

06:27.256 --> 06:28.736
explaining it
to that dip-shit therapist.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.955
I think maybe we
should go back to Dr. Rios.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.130
I think it would help.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.002
We are not going back
to Dr. Rios.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.265
Somebody else then,
another therapist?

06:36.308 --> 06:39.442
We are grown, rational,
intelligent people.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.965
We can figure this out
on our own.

06:41.009 --> 06:42.358
OK, great!

06:43.577 --> 06:45.187
Is there anything specific
you'd like to ask?

06:45.230 --> 06:47.929
No, there is not any,
no, not really.

06:47.972 --> 06:51.280
You know, I'm still, like,
in a state of shock or whatever,

06:51.323 --> 06:54.588
and... just let it sink in.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.810
OK, well, let me know
when's good for you.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.377
Oh, Allison.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.168
Do you really not hear that?

07:23.965 --> 07:27.403
♪ You say you're happy

07:27.447 --> 07:30.711
♪ We met on that Sunday

07:30.754 --> 07:34.105
♪ But I've got
nothing to give you ♪

07:34.149 --> 07:38.066
♪ I've got nothing to give

07:45.639 --> 07:47.205
So, what did
you think of the movie?

07:47.249 --> 07:49.338
It was, uh, very visual.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.209
-Mm-hm.
-And intense.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.386
-Right? So intense.
-Yeah, so intense.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.823
OK, so you have ten minutes,

07:55.866 --> 07:57.389
and I'll come in and
signal you for last question.

07:57.433 --> 07:58.826
OK, thanks.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.610
Oh, and, uh, could you
just stick to the movie?

08:00.654 --> 08:02.264
She doesn't wanna
talk about anything personal.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.527
Yeah, sure.
Sure, thanks.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.704
I like the tie, it's cute.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.184
Thanks.

08:09.227 --> 08:11.273
-OK, all right.
-OK.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.709
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.322
-You ready?
-Mm-hm!

08:17.366 --> 08:18.976
OK.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.239
Um, so, what drew you
to the project initially?

08:21.283 --> 08:24.068
You know, I'd always been
a big fan of the director.

08:24.112 --> 08:28.159
It's been...
God, I loved his first movie.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.161
Even though that was an indie
and obviously this is

08:30.205 --> 08:32.729
a little bit bigger than that,
um, and it was just

08:32.773 --> 08:35.340
a great opportunity for me to
really explore a side of myself

08:35.384 --> 08:38.256
that I hadn't really gotten
a chance to do, you know?

08:38.299 --> 08:41.390
I usually get cast in
these sort of lighter roles

08:41.433 --> 08:43.610
and this was sort of--
I got to show my darker side.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.742
Did you find
that to be a challenge?

08:45.786 --> 08:49.006
Um, you know, all acting
is really a challenge.

08:59.147 --> 09:02.150
You've got ten minutes,
I'll signal you
for last question.

09:02.193 --> 09:03.543
Thanks.

09:05.153 --> 09:08.852
Let me just get this going here.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.551
Why don't you tell me
what initially

09:11.594 --> 09:13.074
drew you to the project?

09:13.117 --> 09:16.381
You know, I just, I fell
in love with the script.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.601
For me, it was everything
about the script.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.560
I thought that the script
was so special.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.387
-Truly, it was a good script.
-It's a family.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.650
I mean, I know
everybody says that,

09:23.693 --> 09:25.173
but we were really a family.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.131
I mean, we just became
such a beautiful--

09:27.175 --> 09:29.525
-Family on set.
-We really became
a very tight-knit--

09:29.569 --> 09:30.961
-Family.
-We became a family.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.789
Did my publicist not tell you?

09:34.225 --> 09:35.705
I don't answer those questions.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.012
People keep talking about
the 12-minute sex scene,

09:38.055 --> 09:39.883
but the truth is,
is they're very technical.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.624
Yeah, the actor's director,
the director's director.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.365
I'm directing him,
he's directing the actors.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.888
So, it really all kinda

09:44.932 --> 09:49.197
just became like, like a...

09:49.240 --> 09:53.505
-Like a snake
eating its own tail.
-Exactly.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.247
Honestly, New York is like
another character in this movie.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.032
Los Angeles is really
like another--

09:58.075 --> 10:00.251
-Character.
-It is basically
another character.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.123
You know, the kind of
silent character in the film.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.343
And if that's the case...

10:05.387 --> 10:07.563
might as well be makin'
cereal commercials, right?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.043
-Yeah.
-I mean, what's the point?

10:09.086 --> 10:10.958
Mm, mm-hm, yeah.

10:13.221 --> 10:16.703
-Are you even
listenin' to me, dude?
-Hm?

10:16.746 --> 10:19.183
Yeah, yeah,
of course I'm listening to you.

10:19.227 --> 10:22.012
-Yes, yeah, absolutely.
-I get it.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.406
You think this is all just
a bunch of bullshit, right?

10:24.449 --> 10:26.408
Stupid big studio movie, right?

10:26.451 --> 10:27.888
Just a bunch of garbage,
but you know what?

10:27.931 --> 10:30.368
You could at least pretend.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.892
Listen, I'm sorry, all right?

10:31.935 --> 10:33.415
I'm just...
It's been really tough lately.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.938
Has it, has it been tough?

10:34.982 --> 10:37.288
Here's some advice,
do your fucking job.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.248
Do your fucking job,
do your fucking job.

10:40.291 --> 10:43.904
I'm tryin' to lay down some
realness for you, some realness.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.383
And you're just all, "whatevs."

10:45.427 --> 10:47.037
-Some realness?
-Yeah!

10:47.081 --> 10:48.909
You know,
this is not realness.

10:49.866 --> 10:52.042
This is not realness.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.131
This is, in fact,
completely imaginary.

10:54.175 --> 10:58.048
This is,
this is free advertising.

10:58.092 --> 11:01.051
You know, why don't I just
leave this little thing going,

11:01.095 --> 11:04.707
and you can just talk at it
while I go into your bathroom

11:04.751 --> 11:08.929
and just jerk off
all over your fancy
complimentary bathrobe?

11:08.972 --> 11:10.800
Because it really doesn't
matter what the fuck

11:10.844 --> 11:13.411
I'm doing here as long as you
get whatever diarrhea it is

11:13.455 --> 11:14.761
out of your fucking mouth.

11:14.804 --> 11:19.156
OK. OK.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.290
There you go, you got it.
Oh, shit.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.730
There you go!

11:29.253 --> 11:30.864
You little bitch, huh?

11:37.174 --> 11:41.613
Maybe I could turn it into
some sort of personal essay?

11:41.657 --> 11:46.357
You know, what it's like to get
throttled by a movie star.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.390
Hey, pudding.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.652
Hey.

12:22.132 --> 12:24.439
You ever have one of those days
where you're pretty sure

12:24.482 --> 12:26.136
somebody just drugged you,

12:26.180 --> 12:28.225
and you hallucinated
the whole day?

12:29.792 --> 12:31.794
Sounds good.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.623
Hey, what do you think of
Mexican-Bangladesh fusion

12:34.666 --> 12:36.146
as a food concept?

12:38.018 --> 12:39.280
Sounds good.

12:45.242 --> 12:48.768
Elliott!

12:51.727 --> 12:53.120
Elliott.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.730
It's unlocked, what are you,
a fuckin' vampire?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.602
-Come on in.
-I could be a vampire.

12:57.646 --> 13:01.563
-You're fucked now, if I am.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.263
Where's the lady of the house?

13:06.307 --> 13:09.266
Oh, at some new media
mixer meetup thing.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.094
-You want a glass?
-No, no, no.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.661
I can manage.

13:15.446 --> 13:16.970
Very classy, cheers.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.757
So, it seems as if
I am in an open marriage.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.068
Allie and I.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.331
Finally, you people
figure this out.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.941
"You people?"

13:31.985 --> 13:34.944
As per usual,
the homosexual community

13:34.988 --> 13:37.251
has been way out in front
on this particular trend.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.122
Have you ever been in
a relationship long enough

13:39.166 --> 13:41.168
for it to become exclusive,
so then it could subsequently

13:41.211 --> 13:42.909
become an open relationship?

13:42.952 --> 13:45.607
So what, you just rolled
the honeymoon into a ménage

13:45.650 --> 13:47.261
in the hot tub and it just
evolved from there?

13:47.304 --> 13:49.045
Oh, there...

13:49.089 --> 13:52.701
There was no hot tub,
nor any ménage.

13:52.744 --> 13:55.095
Are you still together?

13:55.138 --> 13:56.966
No, not in almost
a year, I mean,

13:57.010 --> 14:00.970
we're basically affectionate
roommates on our good days.

14:01.014 --> 14:05.061
-That is lamentable.
-It's bullshit, man.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.107
It is bullshit, the whole
fuckin' thing is bullshit,

14:07.150 --> 14:09.587
and I'm tired of all
of the psychoanalyzing.

14:09.631 --> 14:11.981
The fact of the matter is,
is that we are not fucking

14:12.025 --> 14:15.419
because we are not fucking,
and it's not because I don't

14:15.463 --> 14:18.292
want to fuck her, it's because
she doesn't wanna fuck me.

14:18.335 --> 14:21.382
She would rather fuck
whoever the fuck else
she wants to fuck.

14:21.425 --> 14:25.603
Which you seem
totally OK with.

14:25.647 --> 14:28.128
Apparently, there was
a conversation about it.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.305
You'd think you'd remember.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.177
You'd think.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.833
You do remember, don't you?

14:37.877 --> 14:42.925
OK, what I remember is there was
a totally hypothetical,

14:42.969 --> 14:46.189
theoretical, philosophical...

14:48.670 --> 14:54.110
undefinitive conversation
about the concept of this.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.808
It was had over, like,
the course of a couple
bottles of wine.

14:56.852 --> 15:03.815
We came to no conclusion,
there was no handshake
or agreement on this... thing.

15:03.859 --> 15:06.079
And yet...

15:07.036 --> 15:08.255
And yet.

15:18.265 --> 15:23.661
Hey, Dave. It's Elliott,
just callin' to see
what was goin' on.

15:23.705 --> 15:29.102
If there was anything comin' up
you could have me in on.

15:29.145 --> 15:32.453
Junkets, assignments,
screenings.

15:32.496 --> 15:36.718
I am around and would be

15:36.761 --> 15:42.289
very excited to come and do
somethin' with you guys again.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.987
Or, you know, we could just get
together and have some lunch

15:45.031 --> 15:50.036
a cup of coffee, grab a drink,
whatever is clever, my friend.

15:50.079 --> 15:53.387
Uh, so give me a call back
when you have a sec. Um...

15:53.430 --> 15:56.781
I'm gonna send you an email
right now to just follow up,
too.

15:56.825 --> 15:59.871
Silas, Elliott!
How's it goin', man?

15:59.915 --> 16:02.265
Listen, I was just
talkin' to David,

16:02.309 --> 16:07.749
uh, and I was thinking it would
be fun if you and I got together

16:07.792 --> 16:11.405
and collaborated on
somethin' for his site,

16:11.448 --> 16:12.972
or even for your site, you know?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.670
Just, it's been a minute
since, uh, we've hung out

16:15.713 --> 16:22.155
and I think it'd be, uh,
it'd be great if we could, uh,
do somethin' together.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.287
Um...

16:24.331 --> 16:27.551
and listen, I don't know if
you've heard anything crazy,

16:27.595 --> 16:31.338
any crazy stories about me
lately, but you know, uh,

16:31.381 --> 16:34.558
people just... they talk shit,
everybody talks shit
in this town.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.386
You know how it goes.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.214
I'm sure they even
talk shit about you.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.477
Not that I've heard anything,
but you know, you've gotta

16:40.521 --> 16:43.350
worry when they're not talkin',
that's my point, right?

16:43.393 --> 16:45.569
Right, uh, OK, well,
listen, give me a call.

16:45.613 --> 16:50.096
I think we could knock somethin'
really cool out together.

16:50.139 --> 16:53.969
Um, and that'd be fun,
I'll talk to you soon, man.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.231
All right, be good, bye.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.414
Hey, stranger.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.851
I, um, have an interview goin',
so, I can't really talk.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.505
Oh, no worries.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.116
What's up?

17:10.159 --> 17:12.814
Oh, I was just wonderin'
if maybe you wanted to, like,

17:12.857 --> 17:15.077
get a drink sometime, talk shop,

17:15.121 --> 17:16.948
let me pick your brain
a little bit,
that sort of thing?

17:16.992 --> 17:19.820
-If you're not too busy.
-Uh, no, not at all.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.736
That sounds fun.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.259
Uh...

17:23.303 --> 17:25.782
-How's tomorrow for you?
-Uh, tomorrow?

17:25.827 --> 17:27.915
Um... let me see.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.486
Actually, tomorrow's wide open.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.792
Great, great!
Why don't you just,

17:34.836 --> 17:36.664
you know,
come by the house, then?

17:37.969 --> 17:40.624
OK, uh,
that sounds like a plan.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.975
OK. Oh, and, um, try not
to get choked out by any

17:44.019 --> 17:46.978
-famous movie stars before then.
-Hey, now.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.331
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
you know I had to.

17:51.374 --> 17:52.941
Well, I'll see you then.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.247
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.119
OK, thanks.
Uh, uh, uh, bye-bye.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.512
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.232
-Hi, you made it.
-Hi.

18:23.276 --> 18:26.583
Fantastic.
Oh, give me that, that's for me.

18:26.627 --> 18:29.325
Thank you very much.
Come in.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.806
Nice place you got here.

18:31.849 --> 18:34.156
Thank you.

18:34.200 --> 18:39.814
Yeah, it's a work in progress,
but it is coming along.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.164
I'm just surprised
that these assholes

18:42.208 --> 18:44.035
don't get punched
in the face more often.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.776
I didn't punch him in the face,

18:45.820 --> 18:47.561
he tackled me,
and he's got

18:47.604 --> 18:51.391
years of, like,
movie fighting experience.

18:51.434 --> 18:54.045
You know, I don't have that.

18:54.089 --> 18:57.223
Yeah, well anyway,
it makes for a fun anecdote.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.660
Albeit career-ending,

18:59.703 --> 19:02.053
potentially.
I don't know, I mean,

19:02.097 --> 19:06.623
these junkets, you know,
they're so predictable
and so rote,

19:06.667 --> 19:09.800
and they just, like...
People do anything
to set themselves apart

19:09.844 --> 19:12.368
and I just think, like,
everybody now thinks

19:12.412 --> 19:14.936
I'm the fight-starting guy.

19:14.979 --> 19:19.245
I don't know, I just think
I need to, like, get off
the junket scene.

19:19.288 --> 19:23.901
Yeah, yeah,
stop being beholden
to the studio release calendar.

19:23.945 --> 19:28.341
Yeah, yeah.
I should find some star, right,

19:28.384 --> 19:31.518
who, like, nobody's
talking about, but they love,

19:31.561 --> 19:35.652
and-and bring them back,
and bring them back
into the conversation

19:35.696 --> 19:38.568
and do something collaborative.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.789
Like a hand-in-glove kind of
win-win situation, right?

19:41.832 --> 19:44.270
Yeah, yeah, totally,
change the conversation.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.359
And make my own opportunities,
right?

19:46.402 --> 19:47.447
Yeah.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.103
Excuse me a minute,
would you?

19:52.147 --> 19:53.322
Sure.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.979
Sorry.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.020
-Hey!
-Hey.

20:41.762 --> 20:45.156
You also put in
some central air, huh?

20:45.200 --> 20:48.421
Yes.
It cost me an ovary.

20:48.464 --> 20:52.990
I don't wanna talk about it,
I brought reinforcements.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.775
-You're so excited about it.
-Yeah, no, it's nice.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.646
-You really are.
-I'm just gonna...

20:56.690 --> 20:58.779
-I can tell.
-...finish this.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.914
You know, we don't have to
just talk about work shit.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.612
I'm sorry,
I know it's boring.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.657
Hmm-mm.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.659
No, no, it's not boring,
it's just,

21:09.703 --> 21:15.317
it's not the most stimulating
date conversation.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.407
This is a date?

21:20.496 --> 21:21.715
Shit, this is a date?

21:24.021 --> 21:26.241
OK, see, see...

21:26.285 --> 21:28.852
See, this is the problem
with this city, right?

21:28.896 --> 21:32.639
Everything is always, like,
so vague, it's always, like,

21:32.682 --> 21:37.034
"Hey, we're just gonna
have drinks and hang out.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.907
Let's just chill,
let's kick it."

21:39.950 --> 21:44.085
So, what exactly are we doing?

21:44.128 --> 21:47.697
Elliott, if a woman
invites you to her house,

21:47.741 --> 21:51.266
-it generally means one thing.
-Right, yeah, yeah.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.356
Besides, I thought you
and your wife were on the outs?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.097
Who said that?

21:57.577 --> 22:00.710
They said it,
you know, people.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.147
This town is tiny, Elliott.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.324
-OK, word gets out.
-I hate that.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.065
Yeah, well,
hatin' it won't stop it.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.810
We're not splitting up.

22:15.203 --> 22:19.076
No, I mean, we're not
split up right now,

22:19.120 --> 22:21.514
like, technically,
you know, but...

22:21.557 --> 22:24.125
We're just, like, there's
some things that happened

22:24.168 --> 22:25.996
-that we're working out, and
-Mm-hmm.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.563
it's really complicated

22:27.607 --> 22:30.784
and I'm just,
I'm working it out, you know?

22:32.742 --> 22:34.396
So, let me ask you this, um,

22:34.440 --> 22:39.445
are you, uh, allowed to see
other people, in this process?

22:40.446 --> 22:43.579
-Am I?
-You and your wife.

22:45.799 --> 22:50.499
I mean, that's the
complicated part, because

22:50.543 --> 22:56.113
it seemed like we just weren't
on the same page, you know?

22:56.157 --> 22:59.813
-And we're gettin' bits and...
-Right.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.772
So, how is this
not a date, then?

25:50.853 --> 25:53.160
What you got going on
over there, then?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.425
Just reviewing my prospects.

25:57.468 --> 26:01.037
Hm! Same.
How are they?

26:01.081 --> 26:02.822
Dismal.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.171
Yours?

26:07.696 --> 26:09.132
Well, he seems sweet.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.570
And well-read.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.051
Picky-picky.

26:15.095 --> 26:18.533
Besides aren't you
seeing somebody, like,
seriously seeing?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.187
-Am I?
-Aren't you?

26:21.188 --> 26:23.582
Oh, yeah, right, Jonathan!

26:25.366 --> 26:26.410
Except...

26:30.240 --> 26:32.112
We're having issues.

26:32.155 --> 26:36.159
Just, you know,
compatibility issues.

26:36.203 --> 26:39.336
Compatibility issues,
I know all about that.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.947
It's just, you know...

26:42.601 --> 26:44.124
I'm just, too...

26:45.473 --> 26:47.344
-Girthy.
-Oh, there it is.

26:47.388 --> 26:51.000
For the cheap seats, very nice,
good one, thank you.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.175
Good job.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.226
Oh, I see how it is,
as soon as the boss lady leaves,

26:59.269 --> 27:00.793
all the rules go out
the window, do they?

27:00.836 --> 27:02.490
It's my house, too.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.580
Well, actually,
it's her house.

27:08.017 --> 27:12.587
OK, but, like,
when she's not here, I can...

27:12.631 --> 27:14.284
What's up with
this thing tonight?

27:14.328 --> 27:15.851
-Oh, the party thing?
-Mm-hmm.

27:15.895 --> 27:18.767
Or it's a gallery thing,
or standup.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.290
There might be
an improv troupe.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.118
-Oh you're really sellin' it.
-Whatever.

27:22.162 --> 27:25.600
It'll be dark and loud and full
of desperate, drunken people

27:25.644 --> 27:28.255
just aching for someone to say
something nice to them.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.736
-You'll fit right in.
-Mm.

27:30.779 --> 27:34.000
Will any of these drunk,
desperate people be women?

27:34.043 --> 27:37.264
I think so. I don't really
notice them anymore.

27:37.307 --> 27:38.918
It's like I've got
female-blindness.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.442
OK, but is it like
an exclusively-gay thing?

27:41.485 --> 27:43.096
Not exclusively.

27:43.139 --> 27:45.446
I mean,
that'd be illegal, I think.

27:48.579 --> 27:49.711
I don't know.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.593
All right,
I'm just gonna say it.

28:02.637 --> 28:07.424
I find your lack of effort
personally insulting.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.991
I put on a jacket!

28:10.558 --> 28:12.778
Are you not gonna take
your wedding ring off?

28:12.821 --> 28:14.257
I'm still married.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.738
Listen, I'm strugglin'
to try to find a way

28:16.782 --> 28:18.827
to explain this whole
wife situation.

28:18.871 --> 28:21.221
Well, I certainly
wouldn't open with it.

28:23.702 --> 28:29.142
♪ Let's leave this place

28:29.185 --> 28:31.927
♪ And run away

28:31.971 --> 28:35.409
♪ And build our own home

28:35.452 --> 28:39.630
♪ In our own way

28:39.674 --> 28:42.982
♪ Let's take our time

28:43.025 --> 28:46.289
♪ Leave our models behind

28:46.333 --> 28:47.726
Courage, lad.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.990
Booze will help, come on.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.735
-What've you got there?
-Vodka tonic.

28:56.778 --> 28:59.085
And what's this?
Like, some kind of IPA shit?

29:00.390 --> 29:02.349
Bold choice, I like it.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.655
Hey, uh... who's your friend?

29:04.699 --> 29:06.396
Oh, don't be like that,
it's just Elliott.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.877
I mean, look at him,
he's blatantly heterosexual.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.140
-Hey, hey.
-Hi, Hugh.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.968
Hi, nice to meet you.

29:13.012 --> 29:14.840
-Really nice to meet you,
Elliott.
-Nice to meet you.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.406
You don't think there's
anything in this, do you?

29:16.450 --> 29:17.538
I think there's lots
and lots of

29:17.581 --> 29:18.582
disgustingly cheap
vodka in it,

29:18.626 --> 29:20.497
-so, get it down.
-Mm-hmm.

29:20.541 --> 29:23.762
-Pardon me, young man.
-Oh, hello, spunky.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.677
Hi, who's the square?

29:26.721 --> 29:29.506
This miserable piece of shit
is my good friend Elliott.

29:29.550 --> 29:32.683
Elliott, may I present the
lady of the hour, Miss Dana.

29:32.727 --> 29:34.294
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too, Elliott.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.383
This is wonderful looking
work here.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.167
Thank you,
I almost believe you.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.430
Um, what do you do?

29:40.474 --> 29:43.085
Well, I did just find out
that my wife and I are in

29:43.129 --> 29:47.394
an open marriage and I-I didn't
know about that before...

29:48.830 --> 29:52.094
very recently,
and now I'm, you know...

29:57.752 --> 30:00.886
I'm just gonna press pause
on this super-sad story,

30:00.929 --> 30:03.018
and I just gotta make the rounds
with everybody,

30:03.062 --> 30:05.020
-but I'll come back
and chat with you.
-Very nice to meet you.

30:05.064 --> 30:07.153
-Drink the punch. OK.
-Mm-hm!

30:07.196 --> 30:10.199
-Just say you're a screenwriter.
-But I'm not a screenwriter.

30:10.243 --> 30:11.505
No one's gonna
press the issue.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.376
Nobody wants to talk
to a screenwriter.

30:13.420 --> 30:16.640
What if I want to talk to
somebody, like, women somebody?

30:16.684 --> 30:18.425
Oh, then definitely don't
say you're a screenwriter.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.209
I'm actually a screenwriter
actually, and--

30:20.253 --> 30:22.124
Shh, shh, shh.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.996
-Darling.
-See?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.872
I feel like your
Reactions of the Drought

30:30.916 --> 30:33.570
is like an intensely
political statement, you know?

30:33.614 --> 30:37.792
Right, totally.
How do you mean?

30:37.836 --> 30:39.881
Well, you know,
it's just, like...

30:39.925 --> 30:46.366
Like... like, it says so much
about you, like, politically.

30:46.409 --> 30:49.412
-Right.
-Hey, did you guys see
that thought catalog

30:49.456 --> 30:50.761
essay that I posted?

30:50.805 --> 30:53.199
-Yeah, it was so good.
-So good.

30:53.242 --> 30:54.853
I liked.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.947
-Your bicep is so big.
-Is it?

31:01.990 --> 31:03.513
You know, I never really
noticed it.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.299
Yes, dear?

31:06.342 --> 31:09.084
I think I should call
a time-of-death about now.

31:09.128 --> 31:12.218
Elliott, please, I mean,
it's barely, what time is it?

31:12.261 --> 31:13.915
Who the fuck cares?

31:17.527 --> 31:19.486
You're both really lucky,
I'm gonna get another drink.

31:19.529 --> 31:21.923
Do you guys want another drink?

31:27.798 --> 31:29.191
See you in a minute.

32:14.671 --> 32:17.674
It's very... evocative.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.547
Yeah, that's a word for it.

32:23.593 --> 32:27.771
I'm sorry, I don't do this.
Ever.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.383
Talk to strangers.

32:30.426 --> 32:33.429
I'm not a stranger, I'm Kaley.

32:33.473 --> 32:34.953
-Kelly?
-Kaley.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.258
-Kaley?
-Right.

32:36.302 --> 32:39.696
-Elliott.
-A pleasure, Elliott.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.785
And, look, I got that
on the first try.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.315
So, Elliott, tell me,
how are your morals?

32:49.358 --> 32:52.013
-I'm sorry, my what?
-Morals.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.493
Your morals, how are they?

32:55.538 --> 32:58.759
-Shaky... at best.

33:02.415 --> 33:03.459
Yours?

33:17.082 --> 33:19.127
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.042
What? What?

33:21.086 --> 33:23.740
I have to...
I should tell you something.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.569
-What?
-Uh, wow, um...

33:26.613 --> 33:32.010
Uh, just so that, like,
I'm not, like, a complete jerk
you should know, uh...

33:33.837 --> 33:35.752
I'm married.

33:35.796 --> 33:38.190
Oh, God, I thought you were
gonna say you had syphilis.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.105
-No, just married.
-Oh.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.675
-I'm cool with it.
-Yeah?

33:45.719 --> 33:48.156
-Yeah.
-So... really, we can keep?

33:48.200 --> 33:50.941
I should, oh, oh, OK, yeah.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.856
Mm, oh my God, yeah.

34:04.564 --> 34:05.608
Hey.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.135
Hey, mornin'.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.181
-You OK?
-What?

34:14.226 --> 34:15.835
Oh, yeah, totally.

34:17.967 --> 34:20.058
How was your night?
Good, I take it.

34:23.277 --> 34:26.063
-Not bad.
-Good, good.

35:56.458 --> 35:59.940
-Hello?
-Dude, Colton.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.724
I got your message
and you know what?

36:01.768 --> 36:03.596
I dig it, I'm in.

36:03.639 --> 36:06.425
I'm not even gonna bother
runnin' it by the team.

36:06.468 --> 36:08.644
Uh, that's great.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.124
-Just do me a favor.
-That's good news.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.604
Hit them up, let them know
we're moving forward,

36:11.647 --> 36:13.171
I don't wanna, you know,

36:13.214 --> 36:15.303
bruise any toes,
step on any egos.

36:15.347 --> 36:18.393
Uh, yeah, man, sure.
Of course.

36:18.437 --> 36:21.135
When do you wanna
come by the house, get goin'?

36:21.179 --> 36:23.224
-Yeah, get it goin'.
-Yeah, does today work?

36:23.268 --> 36:25.313
I could totally do today
or later this week, really.

36:25.357 --> 36:29.012
Any time. I could do today,
I'm sure you're crazy busy.

36:29.056 --> 36:33.539
Yeah, yeah, crazy busy,
but, um...

36:33.582 --> 36:36.150
You know, today,
I have some time today.

36:36.194 --> 36:40.459
OK, so, you know,
what time works for you, 3:30?

36:40.502 --> 36:41.677
3:30 good, 3:35?

36:41.721 --> 36:42.896
3:35 work for you?

36:42.939 --> 36:45.681
Uh, 3:35 is great.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.771
Or, you know,
whenever, whenever.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.706
Come on, get over here.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.494
Welcome!

37:59.538 --> 38:01.496
Oh, I was just gonna try
this sweet-ass rose

38:01.540 --> 38:02.889
that Pete Berg sent over,
you wanna try?

38:02.932 --> 38:04.282
-Wanna sip, little sip?
-Uh, sure?

38:04.325 --> 38:09.112
Falsta, are you here?
Is she here?

38:10.723 --> 38:12.246
I don't think she's here.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.161
All right,
we'll do that later.

38:14.204 --> 38:16.119
What are you workin' on these
days, man, any good features?

38:16.163 --> 38:19.035
-Keepin' busy, you know.
-Good, I'm sure, I'm sure.

38:19.079 --> 38:22.517
-Here, have a seat.
-Thanks.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.867
Uh, you know, not that one.

38:24.911 --> 38:27.870
-Right there.
-Yeah.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.568
So...

38:29.611 --> 38:32.614
I really dug your message,
man, and I'm really glad

38:32.658 --> 38:35.661
that Sam put us in touch
because I was just having

38:35.704 --> 38:38.838
a discussion with my peeps
about doin' somethin'

38:38.881 --> 38:41.144
to put me back in the
conversation, you know?

38:41.188 --> 38:43.016
And then what happens,
I get this message from you.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.888
Boom, just like that,
offering me exactly

38:45.932 --> 38:49.109
what I'm looking for.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.632
The Universe, right?

38:50.676 --> 38:53.505
You know, the fuckin'
Universe, man.

38:53.548 --> 38:57.247
-Right?
-The Universe, yes.

38:58.988 --> 39:03.863
Anyway, so, do you remember
Collin's profile in Vanity Fair

39:03.906 --> 39:05.386
that first one
he did a while ago?

39:05.430 --> 39:07.954
It was...
He let this writer,

39:07.997 --> 39:09.912
you know, shadow him
for, like, a month,

39:09.956 --> 39:12.437
and they got drunk together
and they drank with his mom.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.222
They did everything
and they ended up with this,

39:15.265 --> 39:19.748
just in-depth
no-holds-barred profile

39:19.792 --> 39:22.969
-that was fucking epic.
-Hm.

39:23.012 --> 39:25.188
You know, it was fucking epic
and it made him a star.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.582
Vanity Fair made him a star.

39:29.279 --> 39:30.977
It might have been Esquire.

39:32.413 --> 39:35.068
And you wanna do somethin'
like that?

39:35.111 --> 39:38.767
Yes! Exactly like that...

39:38.811 --> 39:42.684
-except, about me.
-Uh-huh.

39:42.728 --> 39:45.426
-Not him, me, right, yeah?
-Right, of course, you.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.516
-Yeah, yeah,
we would do it about you.
-Yeah.

39:49.604 --> 39:51.563
-Uh...
-So are you in?

39:51.606 --> 39:55.436
Yes, no, I'm in, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, when do we start?

39:56.959 --> 39:58.700
I mean,
I think we just did.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.547
Have we been eating
more chicken lately?

40:19.591 --> 40:22.115
We've been avoiding beef
because of the drought.

40:22.158 --> 40:26.424
-Hm?
-Well, you know, because of
the water usage of cows?

40:26.467 --> 40:27.729
-Cows?
-Well, yeah.

40:27.773 --> 40:30.166
I saw a chart
on Eater about it.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.038
How much water it takes
for different products,

40:32.081 --> 40:34.519
and beef is the absolute worst,
so I stopped buying it.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.042
Besides, you love chicken.

40:37.347 --> 40:38.653
I don't think
it works like that.

40:38.697 --> 40:39.741
What doesn't?

40:41.177 --> 40:42.875
The steak you buy at the store,

40:42.918 --> 40:45.747
that cow is already dead,
whether you buy it or not.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.620
The water's already been used.

40:48.663 --> 40:51.710
You can't affect economic change
after the fact like that.

40:55.061 --> 40:57.324
At least I'm trying to help.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.848
We're not buying almonds
anymore either.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.548
Hm, I haven't noticed.

41:19.607 --> 41:24.351
So, I'm thinking we don't
spend that much time
on my upbringing,

41:24.394 --> 41:26.048
it's boring, to be honest.

41:26.092 --> 41:27.528
And, you know,
ET just did this whole thing

41:27.572 --> 41:29.530
on it not that long ago.
They went out to Ohio

41:29.574 --> 41:31.097
and they talked to
my old teachers

41:31.140 --> 41:32.620
and folks I went
to elementary school with,

41:32.664 --> 41:34.274
and big surprise,

41:34.317 --> 41:36.232
what a bunch of fuckin'
assholes, am I right?

41:36.276 --> 41:38.365
-Um...
-You know?

41:38.408 --> 41:40.715
People think Ohio's
all salt of the earth and shit,

41:40.759 --> 41:45.415
but they will stab you in the
back in a fuckin' heartbeat.
I swear to God.

41:45.459 --> 41:48.897
I think we could just kinda
stay away from that whole,
you know,

41:48.941 --> 41:52.292
element and really just make it
about the here and now,

41:52.335 --> 41:55.991
and what an asset I am
and facing the future,
you know, right?

41:56.035 --> 41:58.037
-Yeah.
-Totally, totally, right?

41:58.080 --> 42:00.561
Anyway, good, OK,
so, you got it, you're all set.

42:00.605 --> 42:01.954
I gotta make it to
this Soul Cycle class.

42:01.997 --> 42:03.782
So, we'll talk later, bye.

43:40.487 --> 43:44.056
-Are those from here?
-Don't overthink.

43:45.405 --> 43:48.408
OK.
I won't.

43:49.714 --> 43:52.107
We're not having sex tonight.

43:52.151 --> 43:54.588
Is that a challenge?
'Cause I like a challenge.

43:54.632 --> 43:58.026
I'm serious,
I don't fuck on the second date.

43:58.070 --> 43:59.941
Was that our first date?

43:59.985 --> 44:03.249
Retroactively, yes,
or hang out, whatever.

44:03.292 --> 44:09.342
-OK, so...
-Why no fucking
on the second date?

44:09.385 --> 44:11.953
You know, see if we
actually like each other.

44:11.997 --> 44:13.999
You know,
everyone has it backwards.

44:14.042 --> 44:16.131
The longer you put off the sex
the bigger a deal it becomes.

44:16.175 --> 44:18.699
Everything's always about, like,
"When are we gonna do it?"

44:18.743 --> 44:20.396
Right, but this way
we've already done it.

44:20.440 --> 44:23.573
You know, there's no suspense,
no false pretences.

44:23.617 --> 44:25.401
Now, we can see if we
actually like each other.

44:25.445 --> 44:29.405
-Huh.
-What do you think?

44:29.449 --> 44:32.931
Well, I'm really good
at not having sex.

44:32.974 --> 44:34.628
So...

44:34.672 --> 44:38.980
Perfect.

44:47.467 --> 44:49.817
You know, you still haven't
asked me what I do for a living.

44:49.861 --> 44:52.037
-Haven't I?
-You haven't.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.213
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

44:54.256 --> 44:55.997
It's OK, I kinda like it.

44:56.041 --> 44:57.999
You know, too many people
lead with that.

44:58.043 --> 45:00.698
Mm.
Like you did with me.

45:00.741 --> 45:02.264
Totally, busted.

45:03.918 --> 45:05.964
So, that begs the question.

45:07.356 --> 45:11.447
I'm a makeup artist,
mostly for reality TV.

45:11.491 --> 45:14.363
Different housewives of
varying degrees of realness.

45:14.407 --> 45:17.584
-Wow.
-Yeah, I'm kinda like
the pit crew for the washed up

45:17.627 --> 45:21.980
has-beens of tomorrow, or today,
you know, depending on the show.

45:22.023 --> 45:24.678
-So, did you always
wanna be a writer?
-Mm...

45:26.332 --> 45:27.681
I am not a writer.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.204
But your job, your...

45:29.248 --> 45:30.597
-The press stuff?
-Yeah.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.860
No, no, I had a friend
a few years ago

45:32.904 --> 45:35.863
who was a junketeer
and he told me that he would
just go see movies

45:35.907 --> 45:39.737
and talk to actors for five
minutes and type up a transcript

45:39.780 --> 45:43.175
-and get paid for it.
-That sounds simple enough.

45:43.218 --> 45:46.700
It sounded like the biggest
fucking scam in the world, so...

45:46.744 --> 45:48.310
I'm pretty good at it.

45:49.747 --> 45:52.619
Up until recently,
I got a lot of work.

45:54.752 --> 45:55.883
So...

45:58.146 --> 45:59.191
What?

46:10.506 --> 46:11.986
What was that for?

46:12.030 --> 46:14.423
I just felt like it.

46:14.467 --> 46:17.905
I'm gonna have to pace myself
with you, Mr. Married Man.

46:21.866 --> 46:24.042
So...

46:24.085 --> 46:26.609
I'm probably gonna
regret this, but...

46:30.178 --> 46:33.007
-Yeah?
-Your wife.

46:34.052 --> 46:35.401
Mm, yeah?

46:35.444 --> 46:37.316
I don't know,
what's to know?

46:37.359 --> 46:39.666
How did you end up
married and still--

46:39.709 --> 46:42.060
-On the make?
-If you must.

46:43.670 --> 46:45.541
OK, uh...

46:47.761 --> 46:51.634
Well, my wife, Allison--

46:51.678 --> 46:53.419
Ooh, can we not use names?

46:53.462 --> 46:55.551
Can we just stick to
"my wife?"

46:55.595 --> 46:57.379
Fair enough.

46:57.423 --> 47:01.688
-So, she who shall
not be named...

47:01.731 --> 47:04.909
is from Great Britain.

47:04.952 --> 47:08.564
She's British from the island
of Great Britain, yes.

47:08.608 --> 47:10.784
And we met and dated
for about eight months

47:10.828 --> 47:12.655
and she asked me
to marry her.

47:12.699 --> 47:16.442
This thing,
this is her idea.

47:18.574 --> 47:20.315
This arrangement.

47:20.359 --> 47:23.057
-Oh, my God.
-Hm?

47:24.102 --> 47:25.799
You're a passenger.

47:27.366 --> 47:29.890
-I'm a...
-Romantically,
you're a passenger,

47:29.934 --> 47:32.937
like,
someone else is driving.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.982
That's crazy sad, man.

47:38.943 --> 47:41.728
Like, uh...
but, like, sexy-sad, right?

47:43.295 --> 47:44.383
Like, crazy sexy-sad?

47:44.426 --> 47:46.211
I don't think that's a thing.

48:31.560 --> 48:34.172
You're home early,
how'd it go?

48:34.215 --> 48:37.392
-How'd what go?
-Your date, silly.

48:37.436 --> 48:40.352
I'm really not OK
with how OK you are with this.

48:40.395 --> 48:42.528
I'm just trying
to be supportive.

48:42.571 --> 48:44.095
I'm gonna go to bed.

48:44.138 --> 48:46.314
Oh, here, let me get
out of the way for you.

49:13.472 --> 49:17.345
-We need to talk.
-Yeah, we do.

49:17.389 --> 49:21.741
No, I'm serious, we need to
talk about our problems.

49:21.784 --> 49:24.526
We're in a state of flux,
but we can figure it out.

49:24.570 --> 49:26.702
OK, I mean, you know,
figure out what--

49:29.705 --> 49:32.099
Look, listen, I know we didn't
do this as cleanly and clearly

49:32.143 --> 49:34.145
-as we could have.
-Oh, that's rich.

49:34.188 --> 49:36.147
But, you know,
we're not miserable.

49:36.190 --> 49:37.844
We have money,
a nice home, stability.

49:37.887 --> 49:39.628
That has to account
for something.

49:39.672 --> 49:43.284
This just isn't what--

49:43.328 --> 49:47.723
This just isn't
what I imagined, you know?

49:47.767 --> 49:49.290
Not what I pictured.

49:51.945 --> 49:53.599
This isn't how
I wanna be married.

49:53.642 --> 49:54.904
What?

49:56.558 --> 49:57.603
Nothing.

50:02.216 --> 50:03.652
Oh, must you?

50:08.788 --> 50:09.876
Sorry.

50:17.231 --> 50:22.062
And that was when I realized
that you can't date
actresses, man.

50:22.106 --> 50:24.021
You know, at least not ones with
their own production company.

50:24.064 --> 50:26.284
So fucking litigious.

50:29.156 --> 50:31.245
You gettin' all this,
Gore Vorbinski?

50:32.420 --> 50:33.465
Hm?

50:34.422 --> 50:36.033
Oh, yeah-yeah.

50:37.904 --> 50:39.862
-Don't you mean Gore Vidal?
-Ah, whatever, man,

50:39.906 --> 50:42.169
I'm just makin' sure
you're payin' attention.

50:42.213 --> 50:45.216
I am, I am, but I got a lot
of my mind, I'm sorry.

50:45.259 --> 50:47.087
-Yeah.
-Girl problems?

50:47.131 --> 50:49.481
- How'd you guess?
-It's always girl problems.

50:49.524 --> 50:51.526
Or boy problems,
if that's your deal.

50:52.571 --> 50:55.095
Yeah,
these are girl problems.

50:55.139 --> 50:56.401
Seein' a girl, you know?

50:56.444 --> 50:57.967
Is she hot?

50:59.012 --> 51:00.144
Yeah.

51:01.275 --> 51:02.407
Describe her.

51:03.669 --> 51:04.757
No.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.715
OK, let me see a picture.

51:06.759 --> 51:08.413
No...

51:08.456 --> 51:10.110
Whatever, dude!

51:10.154 --> 51:11.416
Wait, aren't you married?

51:11.459 --> 51:15.115
Yeah, but we have, like,
an arrangement.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.900
Hot. Hot and smart.

51:17.944 --> 51:20.599
Is your wife hot?
Is she smart? I bet she's smart.

51:21.687 --> 51:25.299
You know, I just, I gotta...

51:27.693 --> 51:30.043
-It's that time.
-What're you talkin' about?

51:30.087 --> 51:32.001
I'm sorry, dude, you know what,
I'll listen, I'll listen!

51:32.045 --> 51:34.134
-I'll call you in a--
-Is it with your...

51:34.178 --> 51:36.484
If it's with your wife,
just invite her here, man!

51:36.528 --> 51:39.270
Or the other one! Or both!

51:39.313 --> 51:40.706
Both would be hot.

51:41.663 --> 51:43.100
No? Oh, well.

51:47.234 --> 51:48.757
The fuck?

51:52.500 --> 51:56.809
Do you ever hear birds
that sound kinda like car alarms?

51:56.852 --> 51:58.419
Yeah, totally, you too?

51:58.463 --> 51:59.812
Really? I thought
I was goin' crazy.

51:59.855 --> 52:02.467
No, it's totally a thing.

52:02.510 --> 52:05.165
It's really depressing,
isn't it?

52:05.209 --> 52:06.775
Well, I don't know.

52:06.819 --> 52:10.170
I like it, you know,
it's kind of ironic.

52:10.214 --> 52:12.041
Ironic?

52:12.085 --> 52:15.958
Yeah, like natural beauty
gets invaded by something ugly,

52:16.002 --> 52:19.527
and then nature finds a way
to make it beautiful again.

52:21.703 --> 52:23.270
Hm.

52:27.535 --> 52:29.668
No, it's really,
really depressing.

52:29.711 --> 52:32.801
You think everything is depressing.

52:32.845 --> 52:34.542
They're mating calls.

52:35.891 --> 52:37.937
It's a basic genetic
impulse to procreate,

52:37.980 --> 52:40.374
only the thing that
they're trying to attract...

52:41.854 --> 52:45.031
will never, ever...

52:45.988 --> 52:47.207
ever respond.

52:49.731 --> 52:51.037
It's hopeless.

52:53.257 --> 52:54.519
Hm.

53:08.663 --> 53:12.145
She's like a fuckin' dude,
it's terrifying.

53:12.189 --> 53:16.062
So, you mean she just
wants to have nasty,
unbridled sex with you?

53:16.105 --> 53:17.890
Maybe chat a bit,
but nothing else,

53:17.933 --> 53:21.241
no standard boyfriend
procedure?

53:21.285 --> 53:24.853
-Pretty much.
-Yeah, I don't see the problem.

53:24.897 --> 53:27.552
The problem is,
I don't know how to do that.

53:27.595 --> 53:31.512
I mean, I feel like in spite
of having a dick and everything

53:31.556 --> 53:34.254
I'm hard-wired for monogamy.

53:34.298 --> 53:36.952
Oh... That's terrible.

53:38.432 --> 53:39.999
Why is that terrible?

53:40.042 --> 53:41.305
I would think that
that would be commendable.

53:41.348 --> 53:44.308
Don't know what to tell you,
it's awful.

53:44.351 --> 53:46.266
Well, you could
tell me what to do!

53:46.310 --> 53:49.182
I don't know.
Get with the times?

53:49.226 --> 53:51.402
I am... I am with the times.

53:51.445 --> 53:54.448
I'm a modern--
I'm a modern man,
very sophisticated.

53:54.492 --> 53:56.711
-How so?
-I have very nice...

53:56.755 --> 53:59.018
I have good taste in things.

53:59.061 --> 54:03.805
-I know interesting people,
gay people.
-So, you just got to the 90s.

54:17.428 --> 54:21.083
-I'm sorry.
-It's cool.

54:21.127 --> 54:25.218
Well, not that this hasn't
been thoroughly delightful...

54:25.262 --> 54:29.048
Could I, uh,
you know, come up and...?

54:29.091 --> 54:32.617
Oh, uh, not tonight,
I have a date later, so...

54:33.835 --> 54:36.316
-You have a date later?
-Yeah, a date.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.579
I mean, not really a date,
it's this actor.

54:38.623 --> 54:42.104
He's totally vapid
and obnoxious, but my God,
those fucking abs.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.672
Sorry.

54:44.716 --> 54:47.327
You probably don't
want the details.

54:47.371 --> 54:49.329
Hey, I... I didn't, um,

54:49.373 --> 54:53.290
I-I didn't know we were,
like, seeing other people.

54:54.421 --> 54:56.597
Oh, um...

54:56.641 --> 54:59.339
I mean, I'm not
your girlfriend or anything.

55:00.949 --> 55:02.995
Right.

55:03.038 --> 55:04.823
Come on,
I thought you were cool.

55:09.044 --> 55:11.090
You know...
Never mind.

55:11.133 --> 55:12.483
-What?
-No, nothing.

55:12.526 --> 55:13.614
No, tell me.

55:15.355 --> 55:16.791
It's just...

55:17.836 --> 55:19.707
We never go to your house.

55:19.751 --> 55:22.536
I mean,
I've never even seen it.

55:22.580 --> 55:23.798
Oh.

55:25.539 --> 55:26.932
That was stupid,
I shouldn't have said anything.

55:26.975 --> 55:28.673
-No, no, it wasn't.
-No, it's fine, I'm gonna go.

55:28.716 --> 55:30.283
-Kaley.
-I'm gonna go.

55:53.132 --> 55:55.830
Yeah, you do know
that people can tell

55:55.874 --> 55:58.006
when you send them
to voicemail, right?

55:59.268 --> 56:00.618
Whatever.

56:00.661 --> 56:05.405
I was just calling
to see if you were

56:05.449 --> 56:09.714
ever planning on calling,
which sounded a lot less

56:09.757 --> 56:11.498
fucking stupid
and desperate in my head,

56:11.542 --> 56:16.068
but, you know what,
hey, there you go.

56:16.111 --> 56:19.811
I had fun and I was gonna say
that maybe we should

56:19.854 --> 56:24.424
do it again, but,
you know what, actually,
maybe not.

56:24.468 --> 56:25.643
'Cause, you know.

56:25.686 --> 56:27.819
Mm.

56:27.862 --> 56:29.168
Uh, by the way,

56:29.211 --> 56:31.562
uh, what is this shit
about Colton Jane

56:31.605 --> 56:34.478
thanking me for
putting you guys together?

56:34.521 --> 56:37.176
I didn't press the issue,
but I just thought
you should know

56:37.219 --> 56:41.963
that I prefer to be asked
before my name gets
dropped so heavily, OK?

56:43.574 --> 56:47.534
Uh, so... call me!

56:48.492 --> 56:51.103
Or don't, or don't, whatever.

56:51.146 --> 56:52.844
Uh...

56:52.887 --> 56:55.150
Yeah, I'm just gonna,
yeah, OK, just...

56:57.196 --> 56:59.024
Fuck!

56:59.067 --> 57:03.463
See, with regular juicing,
you don't get the cellulose

57:03.507 --> 57:06.771
and the natural fibers
and stuff, you know,

57:06.814 --> 57:10.862
so, it ends up really not being
that good for ya, you know?

57:10.905 --> 57:12.733
-Right!
-Yeah.

57:12.777 --> 57:14.256
Photosynthesis!

57:15.301 --> 57:18.217
And, you know, plus the sugar.

57:18.260 --> 57:20.393
The other way, the other
juicing way, it's all sugar,

57:20.437 --> 57:23.657
and there's literally nothing
worse for you on the planet.

57:23.701 --> 57:27.313
I had a doctor tell me
that sugar is worse for you

57:27.356 --> 57:29.837
than poison, so there you go.

57:34.407 --> 57:36.409
Yeah, I mean,
you know, more turmeric
would've been good.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.064
-You want a little hit?
-I'm all right, I'm fine.

57:39.107 --> 57:41.501
-Thank you.
-It's your body, bro.

57:41.545 --> 57:43.155
Hey, let me ask you somethin'.

57:43.198 --> 57:45.679
Isn't that the whole point?
Come on.

57:45.723 --> 57:46.941
Let's have it.

57:46.985 --> 57:49.640
-About me?
-Oh, oh!

57:49.683 --> 57:52.686
By all means, what, about your
wife that doesn't fuck you?

57:52.730 --> 57:55.428
Yeah, I didn't think
you were listening.

57:55.472 --> 57:58.170
Dude, open marriage,
hot chick on the side.

57:58.213 --> 58:00.694
Why would I not be listening?

58:00.738 --> 58:02.522
OK.

58:02.566 --> 58:05.917
-Why am I still married?
-That's-that's on you, buddy.

58:05.960 --> 58:08.746
-So, what do I do?
-Oh, cut her loose.

58:08.789 --> 58:11.400
-Which one?
-Either, whichever you want.

58:11.444 --> 58:12.880
Oh, or...

58:12.924 --> 58:14.491
Keep fuckin' the hot one
till she stops textin' you back.

58:14.534 --> 58:16.971
That is what I always do.

58:19.278 --> 58:21.236
Thanks.

58:21.280 --> 58:23.630
Oh, I have liquid Vicodin!

58:23.674 --> 58:26.415
My manager
left it here and there's
a House Hunters International

58:26.459 --> 58:27.852
marathon that starts soon,
do you wanna watch it?

58:27.895 --> 58:29.418
-Let's fucking chill, man.
-All right.

58:29.462 --> 58:30.507
-Yes!
-OK.

58:30.550 --> 58:32.117
Where is it? Falsta!

58:32.160 --> 58:34.554
The first option
is a three-bedroom condo

58:34.598 --> 58:36.425
for $800 a month.

58:36.469 --> 58:40.386
I love that it
has a table on the balcony.

58:40.429 --> 58:43.737
That's actually
a steal for Medellín.

58:43.781 --> 58:45.043
Mm.

59:12.636 --> 59:14.202
You only got one ticket.

59:14.246 --> 59:16.596
I think it's better
if you don't come with.

59:18.293 --> 59:19.991
Allison, it's your
father's funeral.

59:20.034 --> 59:22.559
No, it's already a lot,
all of that over there.

59:22.602 --> 59:24.604
Just, you should stay here.

59:24.648 --> 59:26.911
It feels wrong.

59:26.954 --> 59:30.349
I just, I need you
to be here, OK?

59:30.392 --> 59:35.876
And I need all of that
to be over there, OK?

59:35.920 --> 59:37.051
OK.

59:43.928 --> 59:46.583
Do you need, do you have
your passport and everything?

59:46.626 --> 59:48.280
Yeah.

59:48.323 --> 59:50.804
Do you want a snack
for the road?

59:50.848 --> 59:52.632
Can you piss off please,
Elliott?

59:52.676 --> 59:54.329
OK, yeah, yeah, OK.

01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:49.471
Thank you, sailor.

01:00:49.515 --> 01:00:55.695
Oh, you are welcome... admiral.

01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:11.537
Ugh, you know, this couch
is ridiculously comfortable.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.672
Yeah, I can barely sit on it
for more than, like, ten minutes

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:17.935
before I just pass out.

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:19.632
Is it weird
that I find that sexy?

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:22.983
That you find my old man
TV-watching habits attractive?

01:01:23.027 --> 01:01:25.420
-Yeah.
-That's perfectly normal.

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:37.345
-I, um,
have to admit something.
-Yes?

01:01:37.389 --> 01:01:42.742
There are many, many other
pieces of comfortable furniture

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.657
dispersed all
throughout this house.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.267
-Is that so?
-Mm.

01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:49.053
I was thinking maybe
I should give you a tour?

01:01:49.096 --> 01:01:52.273
Yeah, you hadn't yet,
and I was about to complain.

01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:56.451
Mm, that would so annoying.

01:01:58.932 --> 01:02:04.546
Maybe, um, maybe we could
start with the particularly...

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:07.724
-comfortable bed
in the bedroom.
-Mm.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.161
Show me.

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:23.609
I should, um...

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:27.744
I should really do something
about... my pants.

01:02:38.842 --> 01:02:42.454
I should, uh, also do something
about your pants, too.

01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:47.154
Um, do you think maybe we could,
uh, go back to the couch?

01:02:48.242 --> 01:02:49.940
The couch?

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:53.160
Yeah, this just feels
a little weird.

01:02:54.945 --> 01:02:56.860
It's just my bedroom.

01:02:56.903 --> 01:02:58.992
Well, it's not
just your bedroom.

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.822
It feels like we're doing
something wrong.

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:10.917
I mean, I think it's OK.

01:03:10.961 --> 01:03:17.445
Like... I'm really happy
that you're here
and that you came over and...

01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:23.451
This is really nice.

01:03:28.935 --> 01:03:31.242
Um, do you think
maybe we could just,

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.897
like, sleep for
a little bit or something?

01:03:35.637 --> 01:03:37.248
Um...

01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:41.643
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, of course, yeah.

01:03:41.687 --> 01:03:43.341
OK.

01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:45.125
Uh... oh.

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:50.609
Um...

01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:54.961
Uh, do you want some, like,
pyjamas or something or...?

01:03:55.005 --> 01:03:57.746
I'm-I'm OK, thank you.

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.845
-Is that OK?
-Yeah.

01:04:32.825 --> 01:04:33.870
Hey.

01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:36.568
What're you doin' out here?

01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:41.094
I'm sorry, I couldn't sleep,
I didn't wanna wake you.

01:04:41.138 --> 01:04:44.010
I remembered what you said
about this couch being
so comfortable.

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:49.146
How come you're
wearing your jacket?

01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:52.845
I should go.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:56.936
No. No, come on,
stay, hang out and...

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:01.201
You know, we'll just, like,
watch a movie and we can talk--

01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:03.377
Elliott?

01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:06.206
This is supposed to be fun.

01:05:07.468 --> 01:05:08.905
This isn't fun.

01:05:18.088 --> 01:05:19.393
OK.

01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:34.756
Elliott!

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:38.935
Elliott!

01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:40.675
Yo, buddy!

01:05:40.719 --> 01:05:42.503
Oh, there he is.

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:44.027
Good morning, sunshine.

01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:47.160
-It's open.
-Oh.

01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:50.816
Oh.

01:05:50.859 --> 01:05:54.472
Look, if now's not
a good time, I can...

01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:57.562
Come on in, sit down.

01:05:57.605 --> 01:05:59.303
He said super-convincingly.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.963
What is wrong with you?

01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:08.094
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:15.841
Kaley came by yesterday
and totally freaked out.

01:06:15.884 --> 01:06:19.801
I can't say I'm surprised.

01:06:19.845 --> 01:06:21.673
Your wife leaves
and your first thought is,

01:06:21.716 --> 01:06:24.197
"Oh, gee, I can invite
my girlfriend over."

01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:26.286
-Classy as fuck.
-She's not my girlfriend.

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:31.291
She's made that
abundantly clear, but,
yes, you are correct.

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:33.293
-I am the asshole.
-I'm just saying.

01:06:33.337 --> 01:06:35.382
I don't know if "wife"
is the correct nomenclature

01:06:35.426 --> 01:06:39.778
-these days, either.
-She... is... your... wife.

01:06:39.821 --> 01:06:41.693
There's no gray area.

01:06:41.736 --> 01:06:43.651
If you think that's not
an accurate label,

01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:45.088
get a fucking divorce.

01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:27.782
Come in, whatever.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.528
You know,
you could've just texted.

01:07:34.572 --> 01:07:37.444
I seriously
wouldn't have minded.

01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:39.185
Breakup via text, I mean--

01:07:39.229 --> 01:07:41.187
See, you think
we're breaking up,

01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:44.625
which means you think
we're dating, but we're not.

01:07:44.669 --> 01:07:46.497
We're just fucking.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.805
Ouch.

01:07:50.849 --> 01:07:53.373
I don't even know why
we're having this conversation.

01:07:53.417 --> 01:07:57.160
I mean, why couldn't you
let it just, you know, end?

01:07:57.203 --> 01:07:59.423
You know, that had that
whole thing about not fucking

01:07:59.466 --> 01:08:03.209
on the second date,
and you called it a date.
You said it was a date.

01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:06.473
Yeah, it just sounds
more clever that way, OK?

01:08:07.692 --> 01:08:11.783
If I wanted a boyfriend,
which I don't,

01:08:11.826 --> 01:08:16.265
I wouldn't go for the depressed,
unemployed, married guy.

01:08:20.357 --> 01:08:24.665
-What if I wasn't married?
-Oh, fuck off.

01:08:26.537 --> 01:08:29.844
We could've been
amazing together.

01:08:34.327 --> 01:08:35.937
But I'm a coward.

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:39.984
-I get it.
-No.

01:08:40.028 --> 01:08:42.073
No, you really don't.

01:08:43.814 --> 01:08:45.555
This isn't your lifeboat, El.

01:08:46.774 --> 01:08:48.993
This is my life.

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:52.084
Now walk the fuck away.

01:08:55.827 --> 01:08:57.481
I am so sorry.

01:08:57.524 --> 01:09:00.397
You really need to stop
apologizing all the time.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:04.531
-Sorry.
-Jesus fucking Christ.

01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:17.370
But, really,
what if I wasn't married?

01:09:17.413 --> 01:09:18.893
OK, um...

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:23.810
You're always going to be
married, one way or another.

01:09:23.854 --> 01:09:25.335
What does that mean?

01:09:25.377 --> 01:09:27.118
It means that even if
you weren't married,

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:30.340
all you would be trying
to do is wife my shit up.

01:09:30.383 --> 01:09:33.081
I mean, you're already
doing it anyway.

01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:38.174
Hm.

01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:15.733
It's not irony...

01:10:15.776 --> 01:10:17.474
Mr. Bird Alarm.

01:10:18.562 --> 01:10:22.827
Irony is this feeling of

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:26.483
having never been so alone
and then wanting nothing more

01:10:26.526 --> 01:10:30.530
than to share that with somebody
because it seems so fucking

01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:33.490
imperative and raw.

01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:34.882
And then you realize, oh crap,

01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:37.058
there's absolutely
nobody to tell,

01:10:37.102 --> 01:10:43.848
there's no one to share
this incredible sense
of solitude... to.

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:47.286
That is irony.
Mm.

01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:57.340
You're singin' the wrong song.

01:10:57.383 --> 01:10:58.645
Oh, no.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.359
Hello.

01:11:16.402 --> 01:11:18.056
What the shit, man?

01:11:18.099 --> 01:11:21.581
-Hey, Colton.
-What the shit is this?

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:25.890
I got my publicist bitchin' at me for goin' behind her back

01:11:25.933 --> 01:11:30.024
and doin' some stupid blog
and she sends me a link to this

01:11:30.068 --> 01:11:34.028
trashy movie site that
I've never even heard of.

01:11:34.072 --> 01:11:35.421
What is this?

01:11:35.465 --> 01:11:38.381
Yeah, you know,
the thing about that, man--

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:40.861
It's not Vanity Fair,
this is not Vanity Fair.

01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:43.690
What happened to Vanity Fair?

01:11:43.734 --> 01:11:46.650
-Hey, Colton, can you hold on
for one second?
-Yeah, what?

01:11:46.693 --> 01:11:48.347
Wait, no, but can you
just hold on for one second?

01:11:48.391 --> 01:11:50.044
I'm sorry, dude, just hold on.

01:11:51.872 --> 01:11:53.352
Hello?

01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:55.049
Oh, you...

01:11:55.093 --> 01:11:57.051
Fuck!

01:12:40.486 --> 01:12:41.661
Hey, pudding.

01:12:41.705 --> 01:12:42.923
Hey.

01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:45.056
Hey, you're back.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.144
I'm back.

01:12:51.497 --> 01:12:54.282
-So, um, I've been thinking--
-And so have I.

01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:56.981
OK?

01:12:57.024 --> 01:13:01.594
I thought a lot while
I was there on the plane.

01:13:01.638 --> 01:13:04.336
I just, I sat and thought.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.207
A lot.

01:13:06.251 --> 01:13:08.471
And I know that we've
been having troubles.

01:13:08.514 --> 01:13:10.386
I know things have been hard.

01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:13.824
-Eh--
-No, no, I know that
you haven't been happy.

01:13:13.867 --> 01:13:18.176
But my dad,
he had no one in the end.

01:13:18.219 --> 01:13:19.743
No one.

01:13:20.744 --> 01:13:23.094
I thought,
I don't want that.

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:27.751
It made me realize
how much I cherish this.

01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:29.796
How much I need it.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.798
I don't want to lose it.

01:13:31.842 --> 01:13:33.583
I know
it's weird and different,

01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:38.370
and not like how
you imagined, but I love you.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.459
I love us.

01:13:40.503 --> 01:13:44.637
And this relationship
only needs to make sense to us.

01:13:44.681 --> 01:13:47.118
We just need
to figure out how.

01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:49.120
Together.

01:13:49.163 --> 01:13:50.643
Can we?

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:58.825
No...

01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:05.789
No... I don't want this.

01:14:11.664 --> 01:14:14.624
I pour my heart out to you
and that's your response?

01:14:15.973 --> 01:14:19.629
Look, I've been... thinking,

01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.544
like I said, too, you know?

01:14:21.587 --> 01:14:24.590
And maybe it's also
the thing with your dad,

01:14:24.634 --> 01:14:28.551
but, you know, or everything
that's been happening,

01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:35.558
and, I don't know,
I just, I realized
that I don't want this.

01:14:36.733 --> 01:14:39.387
Like, deep down want.

01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:44.480
-And life is too short--
-You met someone, didn't you?

01:14:44.523 --> 01:14:47.265
Don't you think I haven't
had flings like that,

01:14:47.308 --> 01:14:50.703
just fallen hard for someone
else, but I let them go for you,

01:14:50.747 --> 01:14:52.531
because I married you.

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:55.752
-Yeah, but why?
-Just because!

01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:02.759
No, you can't go,
I won't let you.

01:15:02.802 --> 01:15:04.587
-You won't let me?
-No, fuck you.

01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:05.979
I say we're not breaking up.

01:15:06.023 --> 01:15:08.199
I say that's
fucking preposterous.

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:10.854
Well, fuck you.
I'm not going to let you be
my whole bloody life,

01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:13.639
just because you want
to obliterate yours.

01:15:13.683 --> 01:15:16.250
Grow the fuck up!

01:15:16.294 --> 01:15:18.949
That's what I'm trying to do!

01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:38.621
Fuck.

01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:04.298
Remind me to change
my gate code.

01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:15.266
You don't really
work for Vanity Fair,

01:16:15.309 --> 01:16:17.311
-do ya?
-No.

01:16:17.355 --> 01:16:18.791
You know what
I'm startin' to think?

01:16:20.053 --> 01:16:21.968
I'm startin' to think
you never did.

01:16:22.012 --> 01:16:23.056
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.362
