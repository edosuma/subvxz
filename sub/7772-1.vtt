WEBVTT

00:09.500 --> 00:12.233
- 323 to 584.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.567
- You watch "Castle"
last night?

00:18.667 --> 00:21.067
- No. Melissa had the flu.

00:21.167 --> 00:22.900
- Ooh.
Can I tell you one thing?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.433
- Uh-uh, no spoilers, man.

00:24.533 --> 00:26.267
- Excuse me.

00:26.367 --> 00:28.167
- What the--

00:28.267 --> 00:32.900
- Excuse me. How much for sex
with both of you, hmm?

00:33.000 --> 00:37.567
Also, I'd like
to report a stolen pony.

00:37.667 --> 00:40.467
Come on, Ice Cream, let's go!

00:40.567 --> 00:43.200
Andale!

00:43.300 --> 00:44.933
- * We're too gangsta for TV

00:45.033 --> 00:46.867
* That's why
you don't see us *

00:46.967 --> 00:48.533
* But they still
wanna be us *

00:48.633 --> 00:51.033
Ha ha!

00:51.133 --> 00:53.533
- Yes, I'm on my way
to the interview, Mom.

00:53.633 --> 00:56.800
Yeah, of course
I brushed the back of my hair.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.333
Oh, shoot. Hey, Mom,
can you Google whether someone

00:59.433 --> 01:02.233
can repossess your car
while you're still driving it?

01:02.333 --> 01:04.667
Yeah, but he's
still behind me.

01:04.767 --> 01:06.833
I'm on the phone, sir!

01:07.933 --> 01:10.067
Just remember,
this is temporary.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.767
This is temporary.
This is temporary.

01:11.867 --> 01:14.833
This is temporary.
This is temporary.

01:14.933 --> 01:17.067
Hi, um, I'm Billie Brown.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.733
I'm here for
the babysitter position.

01:19.833 --> 01:22.067
Oh, um, uh...

01:22.100 --> 01:23.067
Yo soy--

01:24.400 --> 01:26.700
- I'm here
for the interview, sí.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.133
Yes, sí.
Yes.

01:29.233 --> 01:30.700
I'll follow you.

01:35.133 --> 01:37.067
Yikes.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.667
- Yes, in the sitting room.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.300
- Hello, hello!

01:40.400 --> 01:41.600
- Welcome!
- Hi!

01:41.700 --> 01:43.833
- This is our home.
Can you believe it?

01:43.933 --> 01:45.267
- No, that's great.
Hi.

01:45.367 --> 01:48.267
- Please, sit.
- Oh, that sounds like fun.

01:49.833 --> 01:52.167
- Oh, or Billie.
Most people call me Billie.

01:53.533 --> 01:54.767
- Well, no.

01:54.867 --> 01:57.433
- This is my lovely wife,
Tanzy, and I'm Kent.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.800
- Russell, yes.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.100
I just read an article about
your new hybrid sports car line.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.600
It's so interesting
to read about--

02:02.700 --> 02:04.500
- It makes me uncomfortable

02:04.600 --> 02:08.567
when people tell me things
I already know about myself.

02:08.667 --> 02:09.967
So we looked over
your résumé.

02:10.067 --> 02:11.367
Very impressive.
Harvard.

02:11.467 --> 02:12.933
both: Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

02:13.067 --> 02:13.967
- Oh, thank you,

02:14.067 --> 02:15.333
but it makes me uncomfortable

02:15.433 --> 02:17.600
when people tell me things
I already know about myself.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.233
- I don't understand.

02:23.167 --> 02:26.433
- No, I was just thinking
about Danny DeVito.

02:26.533 --> 02:27.433
"Twins."

02:30.933 --> 02:32.233
- It's funny.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.700
Um, as you probably
also noticed,

02:34.800 --> 02:36.833
I don't have a ton
of nannying experience,

02:36.933 --> 02:38.233
but I love kids.

02:38.333 --> 02:40.167
I'm sure I'd get along great
with your daughter.

02:40.267 --> 02:41.733
- Oh, she's not mine.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.267
I've never been pregnant.

02:43.367 --> 02:45.700
I wouldn't be able to drive.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.100
- Mm-hmm.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.367
- Oh, that--
Is that her?

02:49.467 --> 02:51.200
Wesley Snipes.
- Yeah, it is.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.967
Can I be honest
with you, Bill?

02:53.067 --> 02:55.233
You know, my--my--
my daughter's a great gal,

02:55.333 --> 02:57.400
but she had some trouble
with school.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.700
- Uh, that's great.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.633
I taught in grad school,
so I could tutor her.

03:00.733 --> 03:01.833
- Oh, that's perfect.
- Yeah.

03:01.933 --> 03:03.733
- I mean, she has to pass
her GED.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.367
- It was part of the deal
I worked out with the judge.

03:07.467 --> 03:08.433
- Judge--What judge--

03:08.533 --> 03:10.233
- Now, my daughter has--
How do I put this?

03:10.333 --> 03:12.233
A criminal past...
present.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.667
You know, I probably should
just let you two meet.

03:14.767 --> 03:16.733
Oh, hey. There she is.

03:19.833 --> 03:24.733
*

03:24.833 --> 03:26.333
- * All this money,
all this money *

03:26.433 --> 03:28.167
* What am I gonna do
with all this money? *

03:28.267 --> 03:30.067
* All this money,
all this money *

03:30.100 --> 03:31.967
* What am I gonna do
with all this money? *

03:32.067 --> 03:34.067
shoot!

03:34.167 --> 03:35.500
Am I late?
- No, no.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.067
- I wanted to make
a good first impression.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.867
Is this her?
She's gorgeous.

03:38.967 --> 03:40.167
Is this your natural skin?
Can I touch it?

03:40.267 --> 03:41.167
- Yeah, no, no.

03:41.267 --> 03:42.167
- It's okay.
I like guys.

03:43.267 --> 03:44.267
- This is my daughter,
Genevieve.

03:44.367 --> 03:45.300
This is Bobbie.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.767
- Oh, you can call me Gene.

03:46.867 --> 03:49.267
Like Eugene Levy,
but just the Gene part.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.767
- I thought you said
your daughter was seven?

03:51.867 --> 03:53.300
- Oh, she caught us.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.067
Oh, she caught us,
didn't she, Tanzy?

03:55.167 --> 03:56.067
- This is a joke.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.067
- I don't know.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.533
- Yeah, we may have fudged
the age a little bit in the ad.

04:00.633 --> 04:01.733
When we said "babysitter,"

04:01.833 --> 04:05.400
we meant more of
a "court-appointed guardian."

04:07.400 --> 04:08.633
- Is that...

04:08.733 --> 04:10.267
both:
An ankle monitor?

04:10.367 --> 04:12.867
Is that an ankle monitor?

04:12.967 --> 04:15.567
- Oh, my gosh. I can do
a spot-on impression of her.

04:15.667 --> 04:16.833
- Yep. Yep.

04:16.933 --> 04:20.067
- Okay, I don't have
the background with criminal--

04:20.167 --> 04:22.700
- Come on, Bill. You never
had any trouble with the law?

04:22.800 --> 04:23.900
- No, no, no.

04:24.067 --> 04:26.833
I-I-I jaywalked once
to save a hurt bird.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.500
- Bird.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.167
You're practically twins.

04:30.267 --> 04:31.200
- Yeah.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.533
- It'll be, like,
constantly having

04:32.633 --> 04:34.733
a gal-pal
to hang around with,

04:34.833 --> 04:36.067
like "Sex and the City."

04:36.100 --> 04:37.400
- Ooh, I'll be Phoebe.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.333
I look the most like her.
You have to give it to me.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.267
- That's "Friends."
- Hire her.

04:41.367 --> 04:43.200
Oh, I should check
this out first.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.733
No, no, no!

04:44.833 --> 04:45.967
- I'm just making sure
we don't have

04:46.067 --> 04:47.500
a Mrs. Doubtfire situation
on our hands.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.500
- Ah.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.733
Bobbie, I'm sorry.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.067
She just saw
"Mrs. Doubtfire."

04:53.167 --> 04:55.733
- That's okay. I got to go
wash my neighbor's house.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.700
- Honey.

05:02.067 --> 05:04.867
Robert, I've written a number
on this piece of paper.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.100
I think the number
might change your mind.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.700
- Okay, thank you,
Mr. Russell.

05:14.367 --> 05:15.833
- The number's
what I'd pay you.

05:15.933 --> 05:17.633
- Yes, I got that.
Thank you very much.

05:17.733 --> 05:19.533
- Good.

05:19.633 --> 05:23.600
Aah!

05:23.700 --> 05:25.800
- Hi.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.267
- Oh, my God.

05:27.367 --> 05:28.933
- Hi.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.367
I'm an academic.

05:32.467 --> 05:33.967
Yeah, I mean,
I would technically

05:34.067 --> 05:35.633
be teaching her, but, no.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.067
No, you know what?

05:37.100 --> 05:38.733
I'll sell my hair.
That's something people do.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.433
Yeah, I'll cut off my hair,
and I'll sell it.

05:40.533 --> 05:42.067
I will persevere.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.067
I don't need money.

05:44.100 --> 05:47.067
I mean, how much
could it possibly be?

05:47.167 --> 05:49.200
Holy !

05:55.533 --> 05:57.167
- Hey, Billie!

05:57.267 --> 06:00.833
I thought about it.
You can be Phoebe.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.633
*

06:11.733 --> 06:15.300
*

06:15.400 --> 06:16.900
- Oh, my God.

06:17.067 --> 06:20.067
Sorry, I was just unpacking,
listening to Beethoven.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.667
- Uh, no.
The composer.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.267
Deaf. Never mind.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.800
- Oh, my gosh, you look
so good with short hair.

06:27.900 --> 06:28.833
- Oh, that's--

06:28.933 --> 06:30.533
- You should totally
rock this again.

06:30.633 --> 06:31.700
- That's not me.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.700
That's my--my boy--
my ex-boyfriend, actually.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.767
We're on hiatus.
I shouldn't--

06:37.867 --> 06:39.100
- Gosh, me too.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.533
- Yeah.

06:40.633 --> 06:44.667
I mean, we were, and then he
got together with Mariah Carey.

06:44.767 --> 06:46.200
But I think that's off.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.300
- Are you talking
about Nick Cannon?

06:48.400 --> 06:51.167
- I don't want to talk
about it.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.900
Point is, it's tough
to find someone

06:54.067 --> 06:56.500
who measures up
to your dad, right?

06:56.600 --> 06:57.833
What is this?

06:57.933 --> 06:59.833
- It's from Mexico.
It's an antique.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.400
- Can I put it on
for a second?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.167
Is this cool?
- It's not clothes.

07:03.267 --> 07:05.067
- Oh, my God.
It fits.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.633
I should totally have this.

07:06.733 --> 07:08.533
- Yeah, I'll hang on to it
for you.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.167
- Oh, yeah.
You can borrow it, sure.

07:10.267 --> 07:12.067
- Thank you.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.733
You really love
your dad, huh?

07:13.833 --> 07:15.167
- Yeah,
he's the frickin' best.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.633
Are you kidding me?

07:16.733 --> 07:18.133
He, like, bails me out
when I'm in trouble,

07:18.233 --> 07:19.967
and he gets me cool stuff,

07:20.067 --> 07:22.633
and he totally did
a commercial with a monkey.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.900
- My grandfather
died in those.

07:25.067 --> 07:25.900
Can I?

07:26.067 --> 07:28.567
- Oh, sh--

07:28.667 --> 07:32.567
- The acting monkey was like,
"Places and set."

07:32.667 --> 07:34.133
- Uh, Moishe's Gold Emporium.
- Back to one.

07:34.233 --> 07:36.133
- Moishe's Gold Emporium.
Uh, wrong number.

07:36.233 --> 07:39.467
I know this before we even talk.
Shalom.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.267
- Oh, my gosh.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.600
Was that a prank in reverse?

07:43.700 --> 07:45.733
I'm in. I'm totally in.
What do I do?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.100
- No, I'm--
You're not in.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.067
I'm evading
my student loan payments.

07:51.267 --> 07:54.467
I mean, if you owe 'em money,
you just pay it.

07:54.567 --> 07:57.067
- Yeah, but I don't have it.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.667
Very funny.

08:01.767 --> 08:03.567
- Can I have--
- This scarf doesn't work.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.433
- It's not a scarf.
It's dashiki pants.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.333
- It's traditional
African garb.

08:08.433 --> 08:09.333
Can I please--

08:09.433 --> 08:10.867
- Is there something
in your mouth?

08:10.967 --> 08:12.867
- My tongue and my teeth.

08:12.967 --> 08:14.667
- It's like you're allergic
to saying 'em.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.167
- "Dai-shiki."
How do you say it?

08:16.267 --> 08:18.067
- "Da-shiki."
- Can I please--

08:18.133 --> 08:19.633
- Oh, yeah.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.500
These actually I do want you
to pick up.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.233
These are these really fun
aptitude tests I found

08:25.333 --> 08:26.633
that I think we're
gonna start out with.

08:26.733 --> 08:28.700
What are you talking about?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.167
- For prepping
for the GED.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.100
You got me again.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.067
You're good.
Burn, sister.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.067
Zzz-zzz.
You're on fire.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.600
'Cause you're here
to be my friend.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.200
That's why you were hired.

08:41.300 --> 08:45.500
- No, I'm being paid
to be your teacher.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.367
- That's not funny
to joke about.

08:50.467 --> 08:52.633
Are your parents
going somewhere?

08:52.733 --> 08:53.767
- I don't--

08:53.867 --> 08:55.433
- I just got here.
They can't--

08:55.533 --> 08:57.500
Mr. Russell.
Mr. Russell.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.733
- Oh, hey, Bill.
How's the guesthouse?

08:59.833 --> 09:00.900
- Oh, it's great.

09:01.067 --> 09:02.767
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?

09:02.867 --> 09:04.567
I don't know--
my dragons?

09:04.667 --> 09:07.100
- Aww. She took
her Ambien too early.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.067
No, we are going to Japan

09:09.100 --> 09:12.700
for three days
for a breathing workshop.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.300
Yeah, I'm confident
you can handle everything.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.233
Just make Gene
stays out of trouble.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.233
- Oh, forgot to tell you.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.733
Quick, come give me a hug.

09:20.833 --> 09:23.467
Oh, kiddo.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.067
I'll get you next time.

09:25.167 --> 09:27.233
Air hug.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.167
Yeah, let's go, Blaine.

09:29.267 --> 09:31.500
- No, but wait.
I don't know what I'm doing.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.400
Busy guy, huh?

09:35.500 --> 09:38.467
- Yeah, he's the best.

09:38.567 --> 09:43.200
- You know, school doesn't
technically start till Monday.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.533
It is Saturday.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.733
- Maybe you could have
a couple friends over,

09:47.833 --> 09:52.533
pop in a movie--
real chill, low-key style.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.600
- Yeah. I mean,
I could be down with that.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.967
- Yeah.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.367
- Hey!

09:57.467 --> 10:00.900
Call me Beethoven,
'cause I can't hear you!

10:04.100 --> 10:05.400
- Gene!

10:05.500 --> 10:07.600
You said this was just
gonna be a couple of fr--

10:07.700 --> 10:09.200
*

10:09.300 --> 10:10.400
* Let 'em know we're here

10:10.500 --> 10:11.767
* We going all out

10:11.867 --> 10:13.333
Oh, my God. Okay.

10:13.433 --> 10:14.967
- Guys, take
whatever you want.

10:15.067 --> 10:16.567
Whatever you can carry,
you can take.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.300
- Okay.
Hey, Gene.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.567
Can I talk to you
for a second?

10:19.667 --> 10:20.667
No.

10:20.767 --> 10:22.500
Ow! That's my bicep!

10:22.600 --> 10:24.333
My bicep hurts.

10:24.433 --> 10:27.233
- Hey, I just wanted to say
this is a really cool party.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.600
Someone puked in my hair.
I'm having a really fresh time.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.400
- Oh, cool.
Nice. Really?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.967
- No, not really.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.333
Someone puked in my hair.

10:34.433 --> 10:35.833
I'm not having a fresh time.

10:35.933 --> 10:37.400
- That's a wonderful thing
to happen.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.400
It's like a bird  on you.
It's good luck.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.867
- If you don't get rid
of these people,

10:40.967 --> 10:42.100
I'm gonna call the police.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.100
Eh!

10:43.200 --> 10:44.467
- Okay, well,
calling the police

10:44.567 --> 10:46.600
would be the least
fresh thing you could do.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.900
Do you hear me?
Top of the list.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.767
- Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

10:54.667 --> 10:55.800
- Yes, I will sleep with you.

10:55.900 --> 10:56.900
No, no.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.467
Why does everyone
want to touch my face?

10:58.567 --> 10:59.800
- Hey, bud.
How's it going?

10:59.900 --> 11:01.333
I didn't know
you were here.

11:01.433 --> 11:03.667
Billie, this is Chet.
He's my best non-sexual friend.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.533
He lives next door.
He's got a big fanny.

11:05.633 --> 11:08.400
- I don't.
I have a normal-sized fanny.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.867
- Oh, okay.
Will you excuse me?

11:09.967 --> 11:11.100
The puke that's in my hair

11:11.200 --> 11:14.767
is running down my body
and filling my shoes.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.633
- What is happening
to me right now?

11:17.733 --> 11:19.067
- I think I have
a girlfriend.

11:19.167 --> 11:21.700
- Well, news report--your
girlfriend is totally not cool.

11:21.800 --> 11:25.067
She was cool for, like,
a hot second, and then--

11:25.100 --> 11:27.333
You know what?

11:27.433 --> 11:29.467
I think we just need
to give her a little push.

11:29.567 --> 11:30.867
- I'll give her a push.
- Yeah.

11:30.967 --> 11:32.067
- In the bush.
- No.

11:32.167 --> 11:33.167
- With my penis.

11:33.267 --> 11:34.933
- No, I think
I have a better idea.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.800
- Okay. But the penis plan
is still on the table, right?

11:37.900 --> 11:38.867
- Yeah.

11:38.967 --> 11:40.067
- It's solid.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.967
- I mean, I feel like
it's foolproof.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.933
- Yeah.

11:44.067 --> 11:45.067
Sizzurp!

11:45.100 --> 11:46.800
- Oh, nice.
Do you want some salad?

11:46.900 --> 11:48.300
- Yeah, I would love some.
- Yeah.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.300
- Please leave.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.233
People live here, and I need
to clean the kitchen.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.633
We live here.
Oh, my God.

11:55.733 --> 11:57.400
Oh, God!

11:57.500 --> 11:58.967
- Don't be racist.

11:59.067 --> 12:01.667
- I wasn't--I didn't--

12:01.767 --> 12:03.133
I'm not being racist--

12:03.233 --> 12:05.600
- Billie.
I see you met Ting Poo.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.100
- Oh, my God.

12:07.200 --> 12:11.300
Why is there a ponytail
in the sink?

12:11.400 --> 12:12.367
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:12.467 --> 12:13.900
Slow your brain wheels.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.133
You're freaking out.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.367
- Hey, I've got an idea.
Let me French-kiss you.

12:17.467 --> 12:18.767
- No!

12:18.867 --> 12:20.667
- Gene, you said
this was just gonna be

12:20.767 --> 12:22.267
a couple of girlfriends.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.900
- Yeah. Relax.
I've got it under control, okay?

12:25.067 --> 12:27.100
If anyone gets out of line,
Ting Poo has a gun.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.800
- Don't worry.
It always jams.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.400
- The whole reason
we did this

12:33.500 --> 12:35.733
was 'cause you wanted me
to have a fresh time,

12:35.833 --> 12:37.833
but I'm not having
a fresh time

12:37.933 --> 12:39.467
unless you're having
a fresh time, okay?

12:39.567 --> 12:41.967
So let's raise
our glasses, yes...

12:42.067 --> 12:43.167
- I don't want
to have a fresh--

12:43.267 --> 12:44.733
- For a toast.

12:44.833 --> 12:47.067
To my new babysitter...

12:47.133 --> 12:49.133
And my new friend.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.067
I'm sorry.
I'm a little choked up.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.300
My new friend.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.500
To Billie.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.833
- That's so sweet.
That's very sweet.

12:55.933 --> 12:58.333
I don't really
want a drink, so...

12:58.433 --> 12:59.700
- Do it.
- Okay.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.200
- She has a neat butt.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.433
- Keep going.
- Oh.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.833
Hey!

13:08.533 --> 13:11.967
Call my Beethoven 'cause...

13:12.067 --> 13:15.433
I love classical music.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.167
Don't you?

13:18.267 --> 13:20.167
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

13:25.067 --> 13:28.533
*

13:28.633 --> 13:31.367
- Ting Poo's Dry Cleaners.
No Billie here.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.867
*

13:41.967 --> 13:43.433
Drink or die, babes!

13:45.233 --> 13:47.300
Oh, I do the best Austin Powers.
You ready for this?

13:47.400 --> 13:48.367
- Yeah.

13:48.467 --> 13:49.867
Oh, baby!

13:49.967 --> 13:51.967
- Oh, that's so good.
How's mine?

13:52.067 --> 13:54.233
Cheers, baby, all right!

13:54.333 --> 13:55.933
- It's good. You could work
on it a little bit.

13:56.067 --> 13:56.933
*

13:57.067 --> 13:58.700
- Black Eyed Peas!

13:58.800 --> 14:00.167
all:
Black Eyed Peas!

14:00.267 --> 14:01.800
Black Eyed Peas!

14:01.900 --> 14:03.500
Black Eyed Peas!

14:03.600 --> 14:04.633
Black Eyed Peas!

14:04.733 --> 14:06.667
- We're gonna live forever!

14:06.767 --> 14:14.267
*

14:14.367 --> 14:15.933
- Joy!
- Joy!

14:16.067 --> 14:17.567
- We're out of rum, baby.

14:17.667 --> 14:18.867
- Hey, baby!

14:18.967 --> 14:20.800
both:
We're out of rum, baby!

14:20.900 --> 14:26.933
*

14:27.067 --> 14:29.700
- She is breathtaking.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.233
- Get it, girl!

14:31.333 --> 14:33.233
Get it just like
Meg Ryan would.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.500
- Yeah, peyote's
not for lightweights.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.133
I was halfway
through a hot dog

14:38.233 --> 14:40.333
before I realized
it was a Coca-Cola bottle.

14:40.433 --> 14:41.800
- Don't feel bad about that.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.733
That's totally a thing.
Switch?

14:43.833 --> 14:45.333
- Yeah.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.267
- I really don't think this is
how you play Apples to Apples.

14:47.367 --> 14:51.367
- No, it is.
Right, Ting Poo?

14:51.467 --> 14:53.900
- Can I be honest
with you guys?

14:54.067 --> 14:57.167
I write "Ladyhawke"
fanfiction.

14:57.267 --> 14:58.533
- Oh.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.333
- As well, I'm having
a great time at the party.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.400
Thank you, Gene,
for the wine glass.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.700
I needed it.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.933
- "And thank you, Chet,
for putting a roofie in it."

15:06.067 --> 15:07.900
You're welcome.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.267
- Chet.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.333
- You aren't supposed
to tell her.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.800
- It's cool.
She doesn't know.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.400
- She can hear you.

15:24.233 --> 15:27.133
- That we roofied you.

15:27.233 --> 15:31.367
- Oh.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.667
- Off-limits,
and you know why.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.633
Billie.

15:41.733 --> 15:42.767
Billie.

15:42.867 --> 15:44.100
- Hey.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.600
- Hey.
How you doing?

15:46.700 --> 15:47.767
- I'm good.

15:47.867 --> 15:50.767
Wow. That was a crazy party
last night.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.467
- Yeah.

15:54.833 --> 15:55.733
- Okay.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.733
- Okay, okay.
Don't freak out,

15:58.833 --> 16:00.900
but remember when Chet
and I roofied your drink?

16:01.067 --> 16:02.133
We actually "hoofied"
your drink,

16:02.233 --> 16:04.667
which is half roofie,
half horse tranquilizer.

16:04.767 --> 16:06.267
Anyhoo, you've been
in and out of consciousness

16:06.367 --> 16:07.533
the past couple days.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.867
Also...

16:08.967 --> 16:13.067
Angelina Jolie
killed Brad Pitt.

16:14.267 --> 16:15.967
- Psych.
He's still alive.

16:16.067 --> 16:17.767
My dad always said
to say something crazy

16:17.867 --> 16:19.533
at the end of bad news
to soften the blow.

16:19.633 --> 16:21.333
- Okay, excuse me, ma'am.

16:21.433 --> 16:22.867
Hi. Can you help me
with this?

16:22.967 --> 16:26.067
- All right,
I don't mind.

16:27.467 --> 16:28.600
Do you want me
to pull it for you?

16:28.700 --> 16:29.833
- No.

16:29.933 --> 16:31.167
- Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

16:31.267 --> 16:32.833
That was so gross.

16:32.933 --> 16:34.267
Wait. Where are you--
What are you doing?

16:34.367 --> 16:36.067
Where are you going?
- I'm quitting.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.067
Why?

16:38.133 --> 16:40.300
- Because you gave me
a date-rape drug

16:40.400 --> 16:42.967
and put me in a coma!

16:52.633 --> 16:53.800
both: And?

16:55.733 --> 16:58.067
- Oh, I thought
we were playing a game.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.833
- Ugh.
- Billie, look, look,

17:00.067 --> 17:01.867
I'm really, really sorry.
This is totally my bad.

17:01.967 --> 17:03.400
I wanted you to have
a good time,

17:03.500 --> 17:04.533
and I just took it too far.

17:04.633 --> 17:06.400
I totally get that now, okay?
Let's move on.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.667
Maybe we can pick on Joy.

17:07.767 --> 17:09.233
Joy!
Joy, get in here!

17:09.333 --> 17:10.600
- There's something wrong
with you, you know that?

17:10.700 --> 17:13.533
There is something
mentally amiss.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.100
- Okay, you know
what we're doing?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.267
We're all focusing
on the bad stuff.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.233
Maybe let's focus on the good
stuff I've done for you.

17:20.367 --> 17:21.833
- Like while you were out

17:21.933 --> 17:23.600
and your student loan people
kept calling,

17:23.700 --> 17:24.800
and I paid it off.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.733
- You answered my phone
and paid my loans?

17:27.833 --> 17:30.300
- Yeah. That's why they call
me The Generous General.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.367
- That is my loan,
and I will work to pay it off.

17:33.467 --> 17:36.467
You know what? I feel--
I feel bad for you. I do.

17:36.567 --> 17:38.133
No one ever gets mad
at you, do they?

17:38.233 --> 17:41.633
No, 'cause no one ever expects
anything from you, yeah.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.633
Well, that is not me,
Gene, okay?

17:43.733 --> 17:49.433
I am not just a problem
that you can throw money at.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.700
Who put this money
in my wallet?

17:51.800 --> 17:53.733
- Nurse!

17:53.833 --> 17:55.467
Take this one, take this one,
take this one for me.

17:55.567 --> 17:58.633
Take this one.
It's clearly the nurse's money.

17:58.733 --> 18:01.133
- So, just tell your dad
I'm sorry.

18:01.233 --> 18:03.267
He'll be back tomorrow,
but I quit.

18:03.367 --> 18:06.333
- Oh, no, they're--they're
coming back in a couple weeks.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.633
My dad Tweeted.

18:07.733 --> 18:09.800
They're going to, like,
Cannies Film Festival.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.367
- Oh, right.
Stupid.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.733
- Good-bye, Gene.

18:16.833 --> 18:19.400
- Uh, I was gonna go
to the mall later

18:19.500 --> 18:21.400
if she doesn't--

18:21.500 --> 18:23.833
- Jesus.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.967
Here.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.833
Is that enough?
- Yep.

18:30.867 --> 18:32.500
- Billie!
Go back!

18:32.600 --> 18:34.467
- Billie!
- Go back!

18:34.567 --> 18:36.133
- Your brakes!

18:36.233 --> 18:38.067
- I cut your brakes!

18:39.500 --> 18:41.200
- No, you didn't.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.600
- I'm coming with you.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.900
- Gene, you can't.
Your ankle monitor.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.233
- I don't care!

18:46.333 --> 18:48.400
No one has ever talked to me
the way you just did...

18:48.500 --> 18:51.400
like you want me to be
a better person or something.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.333
I'm scared of everything.

18:53.433 --> 18:57.467
I'm scared of what I saw,
of what I did, of who I am.

18:57.567 --> 19:00.800
And mostly I'm scared
of walking out of this room

19:00.900 --> 19:02.500
and never feeling
my whole life

19:02.600 --> 19:04.567
the way
I feel when I'm with you.

19:04.667 --> 19:08.200
- That is verbatim Baby's speech
to Patrick Swayze

19:08.300 --> 19:09.633
from "Dirty Dancing."

19:09.733 --> 19:11.600
- Yes, it is, and then they
have amazing dance sex.

19:11.700 --> 19:12.967
- Oh, my God, remember
when she goes behind him

19:13.067 --> 19:14.133
and grabs his butt?

19:14.233 --> 19:15.567
It was, like, role reversal.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.067
- Totally. Whoo.

19:17.133 --> 19:18.067
Say you'll stay.

19:18.133 --> 19:19.067
- No!

19:19.167 --> 19:21.700
No, look, I am not
Patrick Swayze, Gene.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.467
I am the older,
disapproving sister

19:23.567 --> 19:24.833
who never did another movie.

19:24.933 --> 19:26.067
- Yes, she did.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.867
She played Kevin's mom
in "Dishdogz."

19:27.967 --> 19:29.267
- Sounds made up.
- Google it.

19:29.367 --> 19:30.500
"Dishdogz" with a Z.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.867
That's for you.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.667
- Maybe it's not, Billie.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.533
Maybe it's
for Angelina Jolie.

19:36.633 --> 19:40.067
Maybe she did murder
Brad Pitt.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.833
- God damn it!

19:41.933 --> 19:43.333
- Move.
- Oh.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.233
- Move again.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.900
Get off your bike.

19:47.067 --> 19:49.867
We're going to get you home.
Help me!

19:49.967 --> 19:52.533
- Oh, okay.
What is in here, rocks?

19:52.633 --> 19:54.733
- Drop it, drop it, drop it.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.133
Oh, !

19:57.233 --> 19:58.367
Okay, follow my lead.

19:58.467 --> 20:02.333
Be invisible.
Go, go, go.

20:02.433 --> 20:04.067
Oh, farts, Billie.

20:04.167 --> 20:06.400
- I'll handle this.
What are you doing?

20:06.500 --> 20:07.667
- I'm just gonna
go talk to them

20:07.767 --> 20:09.867
and explain what happened--
it's no big deal.

20:09.967 --> 20:13.367
- The only excuse for breaking
probation is an emergency.

20:13.467 --> 20:14.567
Wait a minute.

20:15.933 --> 20:17.300
Gene...

20:17.400 --> 20:20.133
what are you doing?

20:20.233 --> 20:21.900
Oh, good idea.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.700
We'll brain the cops.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.833
We'll stone 'em to death.
We'll both go to prison!

20:26.933 --> 20:28.533
- Oh, Billie, no.

20:28.633 --> 20:31.467
Better idea--
break my hand.

20:31.567 --> 20:33.533
That's so much crazier.

20:33.633 --> 20:34.833
I'm not gonna break
your hand.

20:34.933 --> 20:38.067
- Billie! Break my
hand, Billie.

20:38.167 --> 20:39.800
- No!
- If you love me,

20:39.900 --> 20:43.167
if you're my best friend,
you will break my hand.

20:43.267 --> 20:44.533
- I just met you.

20:44.633 --> 20:46.267
- If it doesn't look
like an emergency,

20:46.367 --> 20:47.400
we both go to jail.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.000
- I don't think that's true.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.467
- It is.
I need you, Billie.

20:51.567 --> 20:53.467
Do it, Billie.

20:53.567 --> 20:54.500
Do it.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.033
- Oh, God.
This is temporary.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.200
- Tell me when it's over.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.267
Let me know once
you've broken my hand.

21:00.367 --> 21:01.600
Oh, God!

21:07.133 --> 21:09.067
- * Call me Polo, shorty

21:15.733 --> 21:16.800
- Make sure--
Excuse me.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.700
- What are you--
What's happening?

21:18.800 --> 21:20.167
- Just trying
to check to make sure

21:20.267 --> 21:21.633
we don't have
a Mrs. Doubtfire situation.

21:21.733 --> 21:23.067
- Ah, I see.

21:23.133 --> 21:24.533
- Yeah, that's fair.

21:24.633 --> 21:26.467
You just saw that movie.
That's great.

21:26.567 --> 21:27.967
- I loved it!
- Yeah.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.333
- Uh-huh.
