NARRATOR:
Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:05.918 --> 00:07.746
I've been accepted
into the Garden Club.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.096
You shouldn't be here.

00:09.139 --> 00:11.011
I was invited.
I-I'm the new member.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.099
No, we-we voted.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.578
Oh, dear.

00:13.622 --> 00:16.277
I am so terribly sorry
for the mix-up.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.583
Rita deliberately
humiliated me today.

00:18.627 --> 00:19.889
DEE:
Is that Rita?

00:19.932 --> 00:21.195
-Do you know her?
-What Rita did--

00:21.238 --> 00:22.761
it's not 'cause she hates you.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.546
-It's 'cause she hates me.
-[both panting]

00:24.589 --> 00:26.504
MAN:
Good morning, it's Dr. Rice.

00:26.548 --> 00:29.159
Are you aware you're pregnant?

00:29.203 --> 00:30.508
I'm his girl.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.075
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.208
You murdered 26 people?!

00:34.251 --> 00:37.428
You've got to stop this madness.
Promise me.

00:37.472 --> 00:38.864
I think this
is what Alma was

00:38.908 --> 00:40.779
-talking to me about.
-Listen to her.

00:40.823 --> 00:43.782
Why are you so anxious to spend
time with an old lady like me?

00:43.826 --> 00:45.784
You're a dame who doesn't know
how beautiful she is.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.961
CATHERINE: Oh, Papa, you must
be getting your strength back.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.398
ISABEL: I think he's
pointing at something.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.922
RITA:
He couldn't possibly.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.186
CATHERINE:
Is there something on the board?

00:56.665 --> 00:58.275
Oh! Ah!

00:58.319 --> 00:59.537
ALMA: You can trust me
with your secrets.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.409
You and Scooter.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.324
No one will hear a word
about it from me.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.631
RITA: Threaten me again,
and this will be your family.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.242
[gasps]

01:20.428 --> 01:23.170

01:23.213 --> 01:25.607
NARRATOR:
From the moment Alma Fillcot

01:25.650 --> 01:29.480
decided to join
the Elysian Park Garden Club,

01:29.524 --> 01:31.656
she began to change.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.268
But her husband
was completely oblivious

01:34.311 --> 01:37.009
to her stylish transformation.

01:37.053 --> 01:40.926
He had no idea
she'd begun to polish her nails.

01:40.970 --> 01:45.148
He had not noticed how elegantly
she was wearing her hair.

01:45.192 --> 01:49.805
And he paid no attention
to her new shade of lipstick.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.199
It was unfortunate.

01:52.242 --> 01:55.811
If Bertram had noticed
these changes in Alma...

01:55.854 --> 02:00.120
he might have been prepared
for what happened next.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.122
Shall I take you
straight to the clinic?

02:02.165 --> 02:04.254
Yes, yes.
I have an early appointment.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.603
Hmm. Very well.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.260
Since we have a moment,

02:10.304 --> 02:12.654
there is something
that I would like to discuss.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.177
Well, what's that?

02:14.221 --> 02:16.223
-Your little hobby.
-Ah.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.833
-Hmm.
-That's funny.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.356
'Cause I've been doing
some thinking about that myself.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.793
You know,
I regret some of the words

02:21.837 --> 02:24.274
that I've hurled at you
in the last few weeks.

02:24.318 --> 02:27.799
Sick, psychopathic, demented.

02:27.843 --> 02:30.106
You were only trying
to alleviate the suffering

02:30.150 --> 02:32.369
of some people
who were already dying.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.981
I see now that you're a hero.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.681
[stammers]
I'm con... I'm confused.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.944
I couldn't comprehend it before

02:41.987 --> 02:44.294
because I didn't know
any of those people.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.035
But now I understand,

02:46.078 --> 02:48.298
because I'm aware of someone

02:48.342 --> 02:51.345
who is desperately in need
of the kind of help

02:51.388 --> 02:53.042
that only you can supply.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.131
Wh... What are you saying?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.654
[stammers] There's someone
that you want me to...

02:57.612 --> 02:59.179
Oh, yes.

02:59.222 --> 03:02.225
And you'd be doing God's work,
my love.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.184
My hero.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.098
Who exactly
are we talking about?

03:06.142 --> 03:08.449
You know Rita Castillo?

03:08.492 --> 03:10.886
She came to our house
with the Garden Club?

03:10.929 --> 03:12.583
Yes. Yes, I treat her cat.

03:12.627 --> 03:13.889
-Mm-hmm.
-Is she ill?

03:13.932 --> 03:14.977
Oh, no.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.936
No, but, um...

03:17.980 --> 03:20.025
she has a husband.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.419
His name is Carlo and...

03:22.463 --> 03:25.074
he's in so much pain.

03:25.117 --> 03:29.383
NARRATOR: Yes, Alma Fillcot
had truly changed.

03:29.426 --> 03:32.647
But by the time
her husband could see it...

03:32.690 --> 03:34.779
it was too late.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.915
â™ª

03:56.323 --> 03:58.847
At the exact same moment

03:58.890 --> 04:02.981
Alma Fillcot was asking her
husband to kill Carlo Castillo,

04:03.025 --> 04:07.508
his wife was doing some
diabolical plotting of her own.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.601
[phone rings]

04:16.299 --> 04:18.780
Phone for you, Mrs. Castillo.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.960
-Hello?
-Hey, gorgeous.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.875
-It's me.
-It's about time you called.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.964
How'd your date go
with you know who?

04:29.007 --> 04:32.315
-Swell, if I do say so myself.
-Good.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.926
Because I need you
to screw her... tonight.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.101
Tonight?

04:36.145 --> 04:37.929
Carlo is starting
to communicate.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.844
He even tried to warn Catherine
about you.

04:39.888 --> 04:42.934
I need that compromising photo
as soon as possible.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.632
She's a church-going spinster.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.677
She's not going put out
on the second date.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.679
Well, then get her drunk.
Tell her you love her.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.507
I don't care how you do it,
just...

04:50.551 --> 04:52.509
[chuckles]

04:52.553 --> 04:54.903
Just, just make it happen.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.948
Goodbye.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.864
You ended that call
awfully fast.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.388
Who was it?

05:01.431 --> 05:02.780
Your secret lover?

05:02.824 --> 05:04.826
For a woman who dresses
like a nun,

05:04.869 --> 05:06.697
you certainly have
a filthy mind.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.308
[phone rings]

05:08.351 --> 05:10.179
Hello?

05:11.441 --> 05:13.269
Oh.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.966
It's for you.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.366
-Hello?
-Hey, Catherine. It's me.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.847
You got any plans tonight?

05:25.890 --> 05:27.544
I thought maybe
we could grab some dinner.

05:27.588 --> 05:31.243
It would be lovely to see you,
but I'm busy tonight.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.767
[stammers]

05:32.810 --> 05:34.203
What about tomorrow night?

05:34.246 --> 05:35.204
You can't say no to that.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.728
It's, uh... my birthday?

05:37.772 --> 05:39.208
Well...

05:40.252 --> 05:42.690
I-I don't want you
to be alone on your birthday.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.301
So, shall we say 6:00?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.694
It's a date.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.182
BERTRAM:
Are you serious?

05:57.226 --> 06:00.098
You really want me
to kill Carlo Castillo?

06:00.142 --> 06:02.013
I-I want you to help him.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.754
Isn't that the term you prefer?

06:03.798 --> 06:05.930
Yes, and every time I've used
it, you've corrected me.

06:05.974 --> 06:06.975
So, what's changed?

06:07.018 --> 06:08.324
Well, I saw him for myself.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.457
He can't move or...

06:10.500 --> 06:13.373
feed himself or bathe.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.852
When did you see him?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.376
Last night, at Rita's.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.900
Sounds like
you two have grown close.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.510
Oh, yes.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.208
She's become a good chum.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.949
Did she get you
into the Garden Club?

06:24.993 --> 06:26.429
Rita tried.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.083
The other ladies
voted for Ada Coy.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.345
Ah, Alma.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.826
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.567
I only wanted to get in

06:33.610 --> 06:35.873
so that I could make some new
friends, and now I have.

06:35.917 --> 06:39.181
Rita's really gone
out of her way to be kind to me,

06:39.224 --> 06:41.270
even while dealing
with a crippled husband.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.707
Did she come to you about this?

06:43.751 --> 06:45.448
Why would she?

06:45.492 --> 06:48.973
It's not as if I go around
advertising your services.

06:51.106 --> 06:54.631
So... you'll help him?

06:54.675 --> 06:55.806
Alma.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.852
While I was away on my trip,

06:57.895 --> 07:00.463
I had a bit of an epiphany.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.595
An epiphany?

07:01.638 --> 07:03.161
I realized I'd only been ending

07:03.205 --> 07:05.120
the suffering of others
to ease my own pain.

07:05.163 --> 07:08.166
My actions were more selfish
than merciful.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.212
So I vowed
to never do it again.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.954
And you won't.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.391
After you help Carlo,

07:15.435 --> 07:18.655
you'll put away
your trusty syringes forever.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.136
I'm sorry, Alma.
The answer is no.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.703
I should go.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.271
Bertram!

07:27.316 --> 07:29.492
We're not done discussing this.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.538
Alma, my mind is made up.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.975
There's nothing you can do
to change it.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.195
[sighs]

07:43.332 --> 07:44.681
Hey, Dee.

07:44.725 --> 07:45.813
Hey. Thanks for meeting me.

07:45.856 --> 07:46.814
Come here.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.380
I-Is something wrong?

07:48.424 --> 07:49.817
Is everything all right?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.296
You sounded so strange
on the phone.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.646
Yeah.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.039
I've gotten myself
into a situation.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.563
Okay, well, we-we can
go somewhere and we can

07:56.606 --> 07:57.955
-talk about it, right?
-Oh, I can't.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.958
And I'm really sorry
to spring this on you.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.221
I, I like you so much.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.442
More than you know, but...

08:07.530 --> 08:09.097
...we can't see
each other anymore.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.533
Why not?

08:10.577 --> 08:12.274
I can't say.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.623
Did I do something?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.190
Oh, God, no.

08:15.233 --> 08:18.193
This has nothing
to do with you. I promise.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.717
Well, whatever it is,
we-we can talk about it.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.502
Like we always do.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.983
You're such a good guy, Vern.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.943
And I think you deserve
all the happiness in the world.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.251
Wait, Dee.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.253
Dee!

08:48.919 --> 08:50.355
Oh, hello there.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.487
Hey, Grace.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.619
What a surprise.

08:52.662 --> 08:53.924
What is going on?

08:53.968 --> 08:55.665
Oh, I...

08:55.709 --> 08:57.972
just thought my garden
could use a little spiffing up.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.757
Oh, yeah, well, I understand.

09:00.801 --> 09:04.021
New projects help us take
our minds off our troubles.

09:04.065 --> 09:07.547
Oh. Well, that's not the only
new project I'm working on.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.287
Hmm?

09:09.331 --> 09:11.159
Believe you me. Tea?

09:17.339 --> 09:19.994
I still don't know why Rita
treated you so badly.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.604
I asked all the ladies
in the club

09:21.648 --> 09:23.301
if they knew something I didn't.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.346
Any theories?

09:24.389 --> 09:25.869
No.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.393
But she's always been
a very unhappy person.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.047
-Mm.
-Not surprised,

09:30.091 --> 09:32.528
-given who she's married to.
-What does that mean?

09:33.790 --> 09:35.444
Apparently,

09:35.487 --> 09:38.360
Carlo was something of an ogre.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.015
Before he had the stroke,

09:41.058 --> 09:43.887
he used to beat Rita.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.245
-That is just awful.
-Mm-hmm.

09:57.858 --> 10:01.078
Please... go on.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.655
Look at that.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.526
It's been ages
since you baked a cherry pie.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.919
Yes, well,

10:15.963 --> 10:17.442
I wanted to do something special

10:17.486 --> 10:19.706
to apologize for this morning.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.447
Oh, when you asked me
to help Carlo?

10:22.491 --> 10:24.058
Yes.

10:24.101 --> 10:27.017
You see, I-I wasn't
completely honest with you.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.019
I held back
some important details.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.543
That was wrong of me. I'm sorry.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.371
What details
are you referring to?

10:33.415 --> 10:34.764
Well...

10:34.808 --> 10:37.767
the truth is,
I don't care about Carlo at all.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.770
In fact, I think he deserves
every bit of pain that he's in.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.685
Well, if that's the way
you feel,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.295
why would you want me
to hasten his death?

10:44.339 --> 10:46.863
Because I care about Rita.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.560
Oh, Bertie.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.911
Carlo is an awful man.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.304
He used to beat her. Savagely.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.307
Rita wept when she spoke
of his cruelty.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.092
That's horrible.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.877
Thank God
he can't hurt her anymore.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.227
Yes, but now she has
to take care of him.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.794
And can you imagine?

11:04.838 --> 11:07.710
Being forced to nurse
your tormentor?

11:07.754 --> 11:10.278
She's so unhappy.

11:10.321 --> 11:13.673
Drinking and neglecting
her own health.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.633
I fear that she might die
before Carlo does.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.722
That poor woman.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.031
But you could help her.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.686
Oh, Bertram.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.427
You want to. I know you do.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.647
You can't ignore
that kind of suffering.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.605
All I'm asking for

11:33.649 --> 11:37.522
is one final act of mercy.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.830
Please.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.746
Save my friend.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.838
All right.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.100
I'll do it.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.972
Oh...

11:52.015 --> 11:54.409
Bless you, Bertie. [giggling]

11:56.367 --> 11:58.021
You know what would be nice
on this pie?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.936
-Some ice cream.
-Mm.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.112
-Sounds delicious.
-Doesn't it?

12:03.461 --> 12:04.941
Mmm.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.864
Are you glad to be back?

12:14.908 --> 12:16.518
You know I am.

12:16.561 --> 12:17.867
Ah, hey, look.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.043
It's our old pal Mr. Murphy.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.741
Oh.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.831
I forgot there was a fire escape
here. [gasps]

12:24.874 --> 12:27.921
This is the perfect place
for my photographer to hide.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.531
I hope he's patient.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.924
It's going to take
a lot of booze during dinner

12:30.967 --> 12:32.664
to get Catherine back here
for dessert.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.710
You may want
to knock a few back yourself.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.234
You'll have to be drunk
to jump those old bones.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.324
She's not so bad.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.500
Excuse me?

12:42.544 --> 12:44.459
Oh, I thought she was
an old pickle-puss at first,

12:44.502 --> 12:45.982
but once
she lets her guard down,

12:46.026 --> 12:47.636
she's actually got
a really nice smile.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.725
And she's only... what?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.074
Five years older than you?

12:53.685 --> 12:55.339
You know...

12:55.383 --> 12:58.342
this seduction doesn't have
to end in consummation.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.691
Aw, I thought
that was the whole point.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.606
No. The photo is the point.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.434
Once Catherine is naked
and on her back,

13:03.478 --> 13:04.914
you'll have hit the high note.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.395
No need to sing
the entire opera.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.266
You're jealous.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.746
Of her?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.574
Don't be preposterous.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.884
You know, I have missed
this old murphy bed.

13:17.927 --> 13:21.061
What do you say
we rechristen it?

13:21.104 --> 13:24.455
Why? So I have nothing left
in the tank for Catherine?

13:24.499 --> 13:27.458
How devious do you think I am?

13:31.941 --> 13:34.422
You've been to the gym
this morning, haven't you?

13:34.465 --> 13:35.902
Oh, what gave it away,
the muscles?

13:35.945 --> 13:37.817
[chuckles]
No, the smell.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.253
You need a shower.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.645
Oh.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.822
Well, give me five.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.607
And-and keep the motor running.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.087
[chuckles]

13:47.130 --> 13:48.392
[sputters]

13:48.436 --> 13:49.524
[door closes]

13:53.049 --> 13:54.877
You the manager here?

13:54.921 --> 13:57.793
I'm looking for a guy
who lived in 3B.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.577
I thought maybe he left
a forwarding address

13:59.621 --> 14:00.709
where he can be reached.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.015
You talking about Scooter?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.668
He moved back in this morning.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.148
He did?

14:06.193 --> 14:07.455
Oh. Ah.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.370
Well, thanks.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.636
[knock on door]

14:16.594 --> 14:18.379
Oh, it's you.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.250
Is Scooter here?

14:20.294 --> 14:21.948
I thought you
were done with him.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.994
Something's happened.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.301
And it's very important
I speak to him.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.305
Please.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.310
Oh, my God. You're pregnant.

14:36.353 --> 14:37.920
You can tell?

14:37.964 --> 14:40.227
Oh, it's all over your face.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.838
That and some
fairly cheap makeup.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.535
Nice.

14:46.102 --> 14:49.018
Oh, before I forget, I have
a message for you from my mom.

14:52.717 --> 14:53.849
You get all that?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
Or do I need to repeat it?

14:56.983 --> 14:58.419
You know what?

14:58.462 --> 15:00.900
I'll come back later
when Scoot can talk.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.599
Are you, uh, sure
you want to tell him?

15:05.600 --> 15:06.862
How can I not?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.124
It's his baby.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.605
Well, what are you hoping for?

15:10.648 --> 15:13.521
That he'll tell you
he loves you?

15:13.564 --> 15:15.349
Because he doesn't.

15:15.392 --> 15:18.047
And what if he decides to do
the right thing and marry you?

15:18.091 --> 15:21.094
You'd have two infants
to take care of instead of one.

15:21.137 --> 15:24.662
Scooter is not ready
to be a father.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.142
Or a husband.

15:26.186 --> 15:29.015
Hell, he can barely cut it
as a boyfriend.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.887
I do not want to marry Scooter.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.498
But I don't got
a lot of choices here.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.458
You'll think of something.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.590
You're too smart
to let one stupid mistake

15:39.634 --> 15:41.679
ruin the rest of your life.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.819
Congrats.

15:52.342 --> 15:53.648
He's all yours.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.911
Thank you.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.000
You know,
if you need some money...

15:58.044 --> 15:59.915
[sighs]

16:12.014 --> 16:13.929
Who was that at the door?

16:15.670 --> 16:17.541
Just a door-to-door salesman.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.978
What were they selling?

16:19.021 --> 16:20.849
Nothing we need.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.809
[moaning]

16:29.640 --> 16:31.686
Mmm.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.166
-Delicious.
-Hmm.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.428
You made my cocoa
just the way I like it.

16:34.471 --> 16:35.516
Thank you, my darling.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.344
You're very welcome, Bertie.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.129
Say, how are you
at housebreaking?

16:40.173 --> 16:41.565
What's that?

16:41.609 --> 16:43.306
You know,
picking locks and all that?

16:43.350 --> 16:44.742
I think it's best
if you visit Carlo

16:44.786 --> 16:46.440
late at night
when everyone's asleep.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.833
But have you ever broken
into a locked house before?

16:48.877 --> 16:50.705
Well, I mean, usually,
when I drop in on someone

16:50.748 --> 16:52.011
to help them,
they just open the door.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.664
Unless they're too ill
to get up,

16:53.708 --> 16:55.231
and then I find a way in.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.711
[both laughing]

16:56.754 --> 16:58.060
You're so clever.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.062
Now, it is a very,
very big house.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.064
And so, I have made you a map.

17:02.108 --> 17:05.415
Oh. Many is the time
I could have used one of these.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.591
Yes. So, Carlo's room is here.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.071
Up the stairs, take a right.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.420
Last one on the left,
not the right.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.900
-That's Rita's bedroom.
-Right.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.076
Now, the front door is
very, very solid,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.512
but if you come around the back,

17:15.556 --> 17:16.687
there are French doors
that lead into the foyer.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.428
-Is that easier?
-Oh, much.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.040
Hmm. Now, will
you have to break the glass?

17:21.083 --> 17:24.043
No. No. I can't leave any signs
of forced entry.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.870
I'd just be asking
for an autopsy.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.917
And if the police
did do an autopsy,

17:28.960 --> 17:31.267
would they find the drug
that you use?

17:31.311 --> 17:32.834
They'd have to be looking
for it.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.618
And they wouldn't be
unless they suspected foul play.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.272
-Hmm.
-And it's never happened.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.491
[chuckles]
My record is spotless.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.927
[chuckles]

17:38.970 --> 17:41.973
26 deaths, each ruled
to be by natural causes.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.758
-That's quite an accomplishment.
-Oh, thank you, darling.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.325
[both chuckle]

17:45.368 --> 17:47.066
You know,
it seems odd getting compliments

17:47.109 --> 17:48.980
for something I hid
from you for many years.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.244
I think it's good
that I know these things.

17:51.287 --> 17:54.116
Makes our marriage stronger.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.422
Yes, it does.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.772
-Yes.
-[both chuckle]

17:57.815 --> 18:00.862
Mmm. Mmm.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.907
You want me to photograph
your lover

18:02.951 --> 18:05.780
screwing your stepdaughter?

18:05.823 --> 18:09.262
If you try hard enough, you
can make anything sound sordid.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.264
Boy, you are a piece of work.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.962
This is completely justified.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.704
That crone has had it in for me
since day one.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.227
I have to fight back.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.142
By using your own gigolo
as bait?

18:20.186 --> 18:22.057
It's not like
he hasn't cheated on me before.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.278
At least he won't get
this one pregnant.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.106
Pregnant?

18:28.324 --> 18:31.153
Remember that large girl
he was seeing?

18:31.197 --> 18:35.070
She showed up at his place today
to give him the bad news.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.506
[flicks lighter]

18:36.550 --> 18:39.248
The... the waitress?

18:39.292 --> 18:40.858
She's having a baby?

18:40.902 --> 18:42.686
I convinced her
not to tell Scooter.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.820
She's not so dumb that she can't
see he'd make a lousy father.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.347
So, if you're not
going to take the photo,

18:51.391 --> 18:52.957
can you refer someone who will?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.482
Did I say I wouldn't do it?

18:55.525 --> 18:56.613
You haven't even
made me an offer yet.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.180
Oh.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.617
So, your disgust can be overcome
for the right price?

19:01.792 --> 19:04.708
Some days
money doesn't mean a lot to me.

19:04.752 --> 19:07.668
Lucky for you,
this isn't one of them.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.237
[doorbell rings]

19:12.890 --> 19:16.764
That's it.
Open up and chew slowly.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.853
[chuckles]

19:18.896 --> 19:20.420
Catherine.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.248
Your friend from
the dry cleaner is downstairs.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.510
Thanks.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.903
[grunts]

19:25.947 --> 19:28.732
Do you want one more fry
before I leave, Papa?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.561
What's wrong?

19:31.605 --> 19:33.737
Are you full?

19:34.912 --> 19:36.566
Why are you mad?

19:36.610 --> 19:38.394
Because I'm going out
for dinner?

19:38.438 --> 19:40.309
That's silly.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.224
I need to start enjoying
my life.

19:42.268 --> 19:45.358
You know, I'm not 23 anymore.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.229
I'll vouch for that.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.883
[scoffs]

19:48.926 --> 19:50.624
I won't be too late.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.235
I'll tuck you in
when I come home. Hmm?

19:57.239 --> 19:59.589
She's going to have sex tonight.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.766
With a man you don't approve of.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.596
If you hadn't threatened
to disinherit her,

20:06.640 --> 20:09.730
I wouldn't have anything
to blackmail her with.

20:09.773 --> 20:14.213
But now I can scare her
all the way back to Texas.

20:16.084 --> 20:19.218
And then it's just you and me.

20:19.261 --> 20:23.222
Doesn't that sound like fun?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.267
[chuckles]

20:50.336 --> 20:52.729
I hear
this is their best chianti.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.558
[chuckles]
But why buy the whole bottle?

20:55.602 --> 20:57.517
We won't be able
to drink it all.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.996
Oh, we got to try.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.128
It's my birthday.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.130
That's right.

21:02.173 --> 21:03.827
I almost forgot.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.877
-Oh, you got me a gift?
-Just a small token, really.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.883
Those are real diamonds.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.974
Catherine.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.280
This is too expensive.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.281
No.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.457
Didn't cost me a cent.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.198
I bought them years ago
for another man.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.765
Do you like them?

21:28.809 --> 21:30.245
I love them.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.725
I'm so glad.

21:32.813 --> 21:36.904
This is shaping up
to be my best birthday ever.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.209
[giggles]

21:38.253 --> 21:40.211
Oh.

22:13.984 --> 22:17.858
So I don't get expensive gifts
for Papa anymore

22:17.901 --> 22:20.339
because I know they're
going to end up going to Rita.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.731
Now, that's your stepmother?

22:21.775 --> 22:23.559
I guess you never liked her,
huh?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.648
Well, actually,
we used to be friends,

22:25.692 --> 22:27.650
right when she and Papa
got engaged.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.391
She was nice back then.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.219
But right after the wedding,

22:31.262 --> 22:33.961
that's when Rita showed
her true colors.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.224
-She wasn't so nice anymore?
-Mm.

22:36.267 --> 22:39.227
No. You see...

22:39.270 --> 22:42.752
Rita can be sweet as pie
as long as she needs you,

22:42.796 --> 22:45.712
but once
she no longer needs you...

22:47.017 --> 22:48.932
You're out on your ass.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.108
I should powder my nose.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.154
Excuse me.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.772
You want to hurry it up, Romeo?

23:02.816 --> 23:04.252
It's almost midnight.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.080
You must be the guy Rita
hired to take the photo.

23:06.123 --> 23:09.518
And I hope I'm doing my job half
as well as you're doing yours.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.563
Excuse me?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.042
I've been watching you work.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.175
If I didn't already know
the plan,

23:14.218 --> 23:16.873
I'd swear you had a yen
for that broad.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.708
He left it
for Catherine to find.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.580
Yeah.

23:27.623 --> 23:30.147
She told him she'd check on him
when she gets home tonight.

23:30.191 --> 23:32.759
I'm just glad
you found it first.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.804
What are we going to do?

23:34.848 --> 23:38.068
Well, we need to keep him away
from all lawyers

23:38.112 --> 23:39.940
and condiments.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.463
This is no joke.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.204
I'm worried.

23:43.247 --> 23:45.467
Once we have the photo,
Catherine will go back home.

23:45.511 --> 23:46.903
Trust me.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.296
She does not want
to be disinherited.

23:48.339 --> 23:49.863
So, what if we get rid of her?

23:49.906 --> 23:52.822
Carlo heard you with Scooter
the night he fell.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.694
If he tells someone
he wants a divorce...

23:54.737 --> 23:56.173
And how's he going to do that?

23:56.217 --> 23:57.523
He can't talk.

23:57.566 --> 23:58.698
For now.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.482
What if he gets his voice back?

24:00.526 --> 24:01.701
Wh-What, what if he gets
to a phone

24:01.744 --> 24:03.485
when one of us isn't looking?

24:03.529 --> 24:05.966
We might not know until a lawyer
shows up with divorce papers.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.489
Then what?

24:07.533 --> 24:08.838
Well, then I'm screwed.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.318
Not just you.

24:10.361 --> 24:12.363
If you lose your home,
I lose mine, too.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.322
Let's not panic.

24:14.365 --> 24:17.020
Once Catherine is gone,
it'll just be the three of us

24:17.064 --> 24:19.501
in this house, and we
can watch him like a hawk.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.503
Sedate him

24:21.547 --> 24:23.505
if we have to.

24:23.549 --> 24:24.550
Or...

24:26.290 --> 24:27.814
...we can kill him.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.337
Isabel.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.339
We've gotten away
with it before.

24:44.178 --> 24:45.919
Are you ready?

24:45.962 --> 24:47.616
Why are you dressed like that?

24:47.660 --> 24:49.096
Isn't it obvious?

24:49.139 --> 24:51.272
I'm going with you.

24:51.315 --> 24:53.274
No, no.
That wasn't part of the plan.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.928
It's far too risky.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.452
What's risky is sending you
into Rita's house

24:57.496 --> 24:58.975
without a lookout.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.629
I won't go inside.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.979
I'll stay in the car
and keep watch, just in case.

25:03.023 --> 25:05.068
Well, I suppose
that'll be all right.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.549
Now, don't forget your coat.

25:07.593 --> 25:08.942
It's chilly out.

25:08.985 --> 25:10.552
We can't have you
catching your death.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.250
What?

25:13.294 --> 25:15.035
It's just nice to know that
you still worry about me.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.037
Makes me feel
like we're back to normal.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.257
Of course we're back to normal.
[chuckles]

25:20.301 --> 25:22.738
I think I saw your coat
on a chair in the kitchen.

25:22.782 --> 25:24.523
-Go get it.
-Yes.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.640
[thunder rumbling]

25:57.991 --> 25:59.819
-[bell jingles]
-Dee.

25:59.862 --> 26:02.212
I've been meaning to call you.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.779
How are you doing?
Everything okay?

26:03.823 --> 26:06.260
Not really. You got a minute?

26:06.303 --> 26:07.478
Look around.

26:07.522 --> 26:08.915
I got all the time in the world.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.220
What's up?

26:11.221 --> 26:12.788
You remember last summer?

26:12.832 --> 26:14.616
You told me about
your predicament.

26:15.661 --> 26:16.618
Well...

26:17.706 --> 26:20.100
It seems
I'm now in the same boat.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.710
No.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.757
[thunder rumbling]

26:24.800 --> 26:26.236
Have you told your parents?

26:26.280 --> 26:27.542
No.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.719
I'm thinking maybe
they won't need to know.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.460
If I do what you did.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.418
Remember, I had no choice.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.725
My folks would have disowned me.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.249
And the guy I was seeing
was married, so...

26:39.293 --> 26:41.991
Tell me about the place
you went.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.819
St. Anne's?

26:43.863 --> 26:45.691
It was nice.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.780
They took good care of me.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.565
What was it like?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.393
When you gave birth?

26:52.436 --> 26:54.482
The doctors gave me something
for the pain,

26:54.525 --> 26:56.266
so it's a bit hazy.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.965
I remember one of the nuns said
not to look at the baby

26:59.008 --> 27:00.488
when it came out.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.881
That it would be too painful.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.710
But I looked anyway.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.060
It was a boy.

27:07.103 --> 27:09.584
He looked just like me.
I think.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.022
They took him away so quick.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.807
Do you know
what happened to him?

27:16.243 --> 27:18.637
My little guy was adopted
by a family in Utah.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.901
They got money,
a big house with a yard.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.990
It makes me feel good
knowing he traded up.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.690
Ever think about him?

27:28.734 --> 27:31.084
What do you think?

27:35.958 --> 27:37.830
But the good news is,

27:37.873 --> 27:40.049
I graduate secretarial school
in May,

27:40.093 --> 27:42.312
and my folks will be there
to cheer me on.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.402
No. I made the right decision.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.017
It's getting late.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.106
I should go.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.327
If you do decide
to go to St. Anne's,

27:57.371 --> 27:59.721
can I give you some advice?

27:59.765 --> 28:00.983
Sure.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.724
Listen to the nuns.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.988
Don't look at it.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.213
[thunder rumbling]

28:13.256 --> 28:15.868
I'm telling you, it's the
only way to protect yourself.

28:15.911 --> 28:18.740
You don't think I've thought
about killing Carlo before?

28:18.784 --> 28:22.701
I came this close to drowning
him in the tub last month.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.050
Then why didn't you?

28:24.093 --> 28:25.878
It's not worth the risk.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.706
I say it is.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.534
We shot Harry.
Look how that paid off.

28:30.578 --> 28:33.407
Elysian Park is not Galveston.

28:33.450 --> 28:37.367
And Carlo's not some violent
brute no one will miss.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.936
I'm not saying we shoot him.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.286
There are poisons we could buy.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.027
Something undetectable.

28:45.071 --> 28:46.942
Yeah, and if the police
get suspicious?

28:46.986 --> 28:49.118
Then we run, like before.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.251
-We change our names.
-No.

28:51.294 --> 28:53.601
I don't want to change
my identity again.

28:53.644 --> 28:56.517
I've spent the last ten years
perfecting this one.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.128
[Isabel scoffs]

28:59.172 --> 29:01.391
Ooh, God. My head is spinning.

29:01.435 --> 29:03.611
Oh. You're drunk.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.614
[laughing]

29:07.746 --> 29:09.530
We're not going to solve this
tonight.

29:09.573 --> 29:13.752
[chuckles]
We can talk about it tomorrow.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.536
[thunder rumbling]

29:16.493 --> 29:18.887
Just promise me,

29:18.931 --> 29:21.150
no matter what happens,

29:21.194 --> 29:23.239
you won't leave me.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.372
I promise. I won't.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.158
Good.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.248
I love you, Isabel.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.598
I love you too, cousin.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.820
â™ª

29:41.301 --> 29:43.085
BERTRAM: There's still
a light on upstairs.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.695
That's Rita's dressing room.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.741
Let's hope
she's not a night owl.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.049
Are you hungry?

29:50.092 --> 29:52.834
I brought us some snacks
and cocoa.

29:52.878 --> 29:56.533
The taking of a human life
is a grave and sacred task.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.579
It's not
a night at the drive-in.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.842
This isn't frivolous.

30:00.886 --> 30:04.324
You know how you get
when your blood sugar drops.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.065
Yes. I'm sorry.

30:06.108 --> 30:08.589
I'm a bit nervous about Carlo.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.939
I'm just not sure
what his reaction will be.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.854
He'll probably be a bit scared.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.943
He might be a little bit
startled at first.

30:14.987 --> 30:17.859
But, you know, you have
such a warm smile.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.600
I'm sure
you'll put him right at ease.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.341
Thank you, Alma.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.343
I'm glad you're here
to tell me that.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.823
Me, too.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.695
Chocolate chip cookie?

30:27.738 --> 30:29.001
Oh, go on then, just one.
[chuckles]

30:29.044 --> 30:31.133
Yes.
[chuckles]

30:34.310 --> 30:36.443
I had a lovely evening, Scooter.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.314
Oh, does it have to be over?

30:38.358 --> 30:40.229
We could swing by my place
for a nightcap.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.188
Oh, I had too much
to drink already.

30:42.231 --> 30:44.233
I'm not sure I can trust myself.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.321
Don't you trust me?

30:45.365 --> 30:46.845
Even less.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.194
It's been wonderful,
but I do think

30:48.237 --> 30:50.457
you need to take me home now.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.198
Ah...

30:52.241 --> 30:54.635
Ah, hang on a sec.
I... I-I think

30:54.678 --> 30:57.029
-I left something at the table.
-Okay.

31:03.339 --> 31:04.775
Change of plans.

31:04.819 --> 31:05.994
She wants me to take her home.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.430
Are you calling it off?

31:07.474 --> 31:08.867
What am I supposed to do?

31:08.910 --> 31:10.216
Drag her back to my place?

31:10.259 --> 31:11.913
Rita expects a photo
in the morning.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.220
How do you think she'll react
if we don't deliver?

31:14.263 --> 31:16.265
Oh, geez.

31:16.309 --> 31:17.876
Okay.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.616
Follow me back to Rita's place.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.401
I'll try to get
something started there.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.017
-â™ª
-[wind gusting]

31:41.725 --> 31:43.466
It's off. Rita's light is off.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.294
Here we go. Wish me luck.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.122
Here. When you get
into Carlo's room,

31:47.166 --> 31:48.428
just give me a signal

31:48.471 --> 31:51.083
-through the window.
-Why?

31:51.126 --> 31:53.999
So I know that you
made it upstairs safely.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.175
Just shine your flashlight
out the window.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.133
-Oh.
-All right? Yeah, okay.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.657
Bye. Good luck.

32:00.701 --> 32:03.095
And if anything happens
downstairs, let me know.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.226
How will I do that?

32:04.270 --> 32:05.575
Honk the horn.

32:05.619 --> 32:08.013
We're having quite an adventure,
aren't we?

32:08.056 --> 32:09.492
Yes. We're like
Bonnie and Clyde.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.059
[laughing]

32:11.103 --> 32:13.453
-But with cookies.
-Yes. [laughs]

[thunder crashing]

[floor creaking]

33:29.007 --> 33:30.965
You're awake.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.011
I'm sorry to startle you.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.578
I'm not sure
if you'll remember me.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.537
I'm Dr. Fillcot.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.755
Your vet.

What?

33:58.993 --> 34:00.690
I know you're...

34:00.734 --> 34:02.692
in a great deal of pain.

34:03.737 --> 34:07.132
And I'm here to relieve you
of your suffering.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.090
[groaning]

34:10.787 --> 34:12.572
Perhaps we'll start
with a sedative.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.028
[thunder rumbling]

34:39.338 --> 34:41.383
[wind gusting]

34:43.255 --> 34:45.300
[wind howling]

34:50.958 --> 34:53.003
[brakes squeak]

35:02.012 --> 35:03.840
Boy. How about that wind?

35:03.884 --> 35:05.451
I think a storm is coming.

35:05.494 --> 35:06.669
My hair is frightful.

35:06.713 --> 35:07.801
Make yourself at home.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.585
I'll only be a moment.

35:16.853 --> 35:18.203
Did you hear something?

35:18.246 --> 35:19.334
[thunder crashes]

35:24.861 --> 35:26.211
[thunder rumbling]

35:36.221 --> 35:38.788
You said,
"Make yourself at home."

35:40.050 --> 35:41.269
Scooter, really.

35:41.313 --> 35:43.141
I'm old enough
to be your mother.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.274
You're never too old
to have fun.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.191
Why do you want
to have fun with me?

35:50.235 --> 35:51.975
Let's face it.

35:52.019 --> 35:54.108
I'm not a great beauty.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.066
I'm lonely, okay?

35:56.110 --> 35:58.504
You seem like
you're lonely, too.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.247
Yes.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.987
I am lonely.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.121
And rich.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.993
If having money means
you can't trust anyone,

36:10.037 --> 36:12.518
that you can't accept love
when offered...

36:12.561 --> 36:14.520
then what good is it?

36:17.523 --> 36:19.220
[groaning]

36:19.264 --> 36:21.788
There's no need
to be frightened.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.877
It'll all be over so soon.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.838
I want your last moments
to be serene.

36:28.882 --> 36:31.232
-[groans]
-And beautiful.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.365
-[thunder crashes]
-[gasping]

36:34.844 --> 36:37.934
Oh. Did the lightning
startle you?

36:37.978 --> 36:40.023
I'm so sorry.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.242
[grunts]

36:41.286 --> 36:43.244
[groans]

36:47.379 --> 36:49.076
CATHERINE:
So, you really like me?

36:49.119 --> 36:51.121
SCOOTER:
Of course I do.

36:51.165 --> 36:53.211
You're the nicest person
I've met in this town.

36:53.254 --> 36:56.214
CATHERINE:
I'm not that nice.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.520
SCOOTER:
Come on.

36:58.564 --> 36:59.869
You're a doll.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.567
You treat me like I'm somebody,

37:01.610 --> 37:03.743
and the sweet way
you take care of your dad.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.527
CATHERINE:
Oh, I hate my papa.

37:05.571 --> 37:07.660
Even more since I met you.

37:07.703 --> 37:11.185
You make me remember
everything he took from me.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.361
When I still
had something to offer.

37:24.938 --> 37:27.549
I know what it feels like
to think you've missed the boat.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.901
That it's too late

37:31.945 --> 37:33.468
to get what you want.

37:33.512 --> 37:36.210
Maybe it is.

37:38.212 --> 37:39.866
Or maybe it isn't.

37:47.003 --> 37:49.049
[panting]

[breathing heavily]

38:13.508 --> 38:15.336
Bertram.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.033
Alma, what are you doing?

38:17.077 --> 38:18.861
There are two people downstairs.
I don't know who they are.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.515
Why didn't you honk the horn?

38:21.560 --> 38:23.692
I did.
You must just not have heard it.

38:23.736 --> 38:25.433
[gasps] Oh. Is it done?

38:25.477 --> 38:27.174
Yes, his suffering has ended.

38:27.217 --> 38:29.045
Which is more than
can be said for mine.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.656
That old man grabbed me.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.048
Will you stop complaining.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.354
We need to get out of here.
Come on.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.400
[clears throat]

38:41.493 --> 38:44.104
There were two people talking
in the living room earlier.

38:44.147 --> 38:45.584
A man and a woman.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.282
[moaning]

38:48.326 --> 38:50.153
Well, they're not talking now.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.423
[thunder rumbling]

38:59.902 --> 39:01.513
Are they there?

39:01.556 --> 39:02.992
Shh.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.442
Maybe the wind
will distract them.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.922
They don't need any more
distracting. Come on.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.795

[door opens]

41:51.117 --> 41:54.250
Rise and shine, Papa.

41:54.294 --> 41:56.296
The clouds are gone.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.994
It's a glorious day, Papa.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.824
Papa?

42:05.435 --> 42:07.350
Papa!

[gasps]

42:15.315 --> 42:17.360
[knock on door]

42:25.847 --> 42:27.370
We have to talk.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.373
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to talk.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.375
I'm ashamed
of how I left things.

42:32.419 --> 42:33.594
Now, just forget about it.

42:33.638 --> 42:35.509
No, I have to explain.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.032
The truth is, I...

42:37.076 --> 42:38.860
I'm in so much trouble.

42:38.904 --> 42:40.862
And lately it's felt like

42:40.906 --> 42:42.647
you're my best friend
in the world.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.387
So, I'm back.

42:44.431 --> 42:46.868
Because I trust you
to give me good advice.

42:46.912 --> 42:49.044
See, the...

42:49.088 --> 42:50.829
The thing
I couldn't tell you was...

42:50.872 --> 42:52.352
You're pregnant.

42:54.397 --> 42:55.442
How?

42:55.485 --> 42:57.183
I am a detective.

42:57.226 --> 42:59.315
Oh, Vern.

43:00.839 --> 43:02.362
What am I gonna do?

43:02.405 --> 43:04.625
Here's a thought.

43:04.669 --> 43:06.453
Marry me.

43:06.496 --> 43:08.237
What?

43:09.978 --> 43:12.502
Look, if you're just trying
to be a good guy here...

43:12.546 --> 43:14.722
No. That's not what this is.

43:16.202 --> 43:18.639
But you'd be raising
another man's baby.

43:18.683 --> 43:21.294
With the woman I love.

43:21.337 --> 43:22.948
[gasps]

43:22.991 --> 43:25.211
Oh, Vern.

43:25.254 --> 43:26.778
Are you absolutely sure?

43:26.821 --> 43:28.518
Oh, yeah.

43:28.562 --> 43:30.390
I've given it a lot of thought.

43:30.433 --> 43:31.783
In fact...

43:32.784 --> 43:35.047
I bought this for you
last night.

43:36.439 --> 43:38.093
I hope it's okay.

43:39.051 --> 43:40.618
[gasps]

43:45.971 --> 43:48.451
Sorry for being so blunt.

43:48.495 --> 43:50.236
I probably should have had
a fancy speech prepared.

43:50.279 --> 43:51.541
But...

43:53.282 --> 43:54.457
But if you'll have me...

43:54.501 --> 43:56.546
[crying]

44:03.684 --> 44:05.381
I guess that's a yes, huh?

44:05.425 --> 44:07.819
Oh. That's more than a yes.

44:07.862 --> 44:09.821
That's a "you betcha."

44:09.864 --> 44:11.823

45:07.269 --> 45:08.706
Hello.

45:08.749 --> 45:09.968
Yes, hello.

45:10.011 --> 45:12.622
My name is Mary Booth.

45:12.666 --> 45:14.363
I live in your neighborhood.

45:14.407 --> 45:17.105
I drove by your home
and saw the ambulance.

45:17.149 --> 45:18.672
I was concerned.

45:18.716 --> 45:21.283
Did something happen
to Mr. Castillo?

45:21.327 --> 45:22.894
Yes.

45:22.937 --> 45:24.547
My father died last night.

45:24.591 --> 45:26.071
Oh, no.

45:26.114 --> 45:27.855
Well, um...

45:27.899 --> 45:30.466
This is just awful of me to ask,

45:30.510 --> 45:32.642
but do you know how he died?

45:32.686 --> 45:34.209
What do you mean?

45:34.253 --> 45:36.995
Well, I was in a cafÃ© last week,

45:37.038 --> 45:39.084
and I overheard his wife Rita

45:39.127 --> 45:41.477
saying the most awful things
about him

45:41.521 --> 45:43.523
and the money
that she expected to inherit.

45:43.566 --> 45:47.005
Uh, "Any day now"
was the phrase that she used.

45:47.048 --> 45:49.007
When you said that he'd died,

45:49.050 --> 45:52.010
the hairs on the back of my neck
just stood up.

45:52.053 --> 45:54.447
I...

45:54.490 --> 45:56.492
Maybe it's wrong of me,
but I felt that I had

45:56.536 --> 45:57.755
to say something.

45:57.798 --> 45:59.669
No.

45:59.713 --> 46:01.846
It's a good thing you called.

46:07.025 --> 46:09.027
[takes deep breath]
