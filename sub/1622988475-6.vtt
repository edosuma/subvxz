I am so terribly sorry
for the mix-up.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.583
Rita deliberately
humiliated me today.

Is that Rita?

00:19.932 --> 00:21.195
-Do you know her?
-What Rita did--

00:21.238 --> 00:22.761
it's not 'cause she hates you.

I'm his girl.

-Yeah.

You've got to stop this madness.

-Listen to her.

00:40.823 --> 00:43.782
Why are you so anxious to spend
time with an old lady like me?

You're a dame who doesn't know
how beautiful she is.

From the moment Alma Fillcot

01:25.650 --> 01:29.480
decided to join
the Elysian Park Garden Club,

01:29.524 --> 01:31.656
she began to change.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.268
But her husband
was completely oblivious

01:34.311 --> 01:37.009
to her stylish transformation.

01:37.053 --> 01:40.926
He had no idea
she'd begun to polish her nails.

01:40.970 --> 01:45.148
He had not noticed how elegantly
she was wearing her hair.

01:45.192 --> 01:49.805
And he paid no attention
to her new shade of lipstick.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.199
It was unfortunate.

01:52.242 --> 01:55.811
If Bertram had noticed
these changes in Alma...

01:55.854 --> 02:00.120
he might have been prepared
for what happened next.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.122
Shall I take you
straight to the clinic?

02:02.165 --> 02:04.254
Yes, yes.
I have an early appointment.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.603
Hmm. Very well.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.260
Since we have a moment,

02:10.304 --> 02:12.654
there is something
that I would like to discuss.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.177
Well, what's that?

02:14.221 --> 02:16.223
-Your little hobby.
-Ah.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.833
-Hmm.
-That's funny.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.356
'Cause I've been doing
some thinking about that myself.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.793
You know,
I regret some of the words

02:21.837 --> 02:24.274

in the last few weeks.

02:24.318 --> 02:27.799

02:41.987 --> 02:44.294
because I didn't know
any of those people.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.035
But now I understand,

02:46.078 --> 02:48.298
because I'm aware of someone

02:48.342 --> 02:51.345
who is desperately in need
of the kind of help

02:51.388 --> 02:53.042
that only you can supply.

Apparently,

Carlo was something of an ogre.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.015
Before he had the stroke,

09:41.058 --> 09:43.887
he used to beat Rita.

-That is just awful.
-Mm-hmm.

to help Carlo?

10:22.491 --> 10:24.058
Yes.

10:24.101 --> 10:27.017
You see, I-I wasn't
completely honest with you.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.019
I held back
some important details.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.543
That was wrong of me. I'm sorry.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.371
What details
are you referring to?

10:33.415 --> 10:34.764
Well...

the truth is,
I don't care about Carlo at all.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.770
In fact, I think he deserves
every bit of pain that he's in.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.685
Well, if that's the way
you feel,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.295
why would you want me
to hasten his death?

10:44.339 --> 10:46.863
Because I care about Rita.

Oh, Bertie.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.911
Carlo is an awful man.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.304
He used to beat her. Savagely.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.307
Rita wept when she spoke
of his cruelty.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.092
That's horrible.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.877
Thank God
he can't hurt her anymore.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.227
Yes, but now she has
to take care of him.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.794
And can you imagine?

11:04.838 --> 11:07.710
Being forced to nurse
your tormentor?

11:07.754 --> 11:10.278
She's so unhappy.

11:10.321 --> 11:13.673
Drinking and neglecting
her own health.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.633
I fear that she might die
before Carlo does.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.722
That poor woman.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.031
But you could help her.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.686
Oh, Bertram.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.427
You want to. I know you do.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.647
You can't ignore
that kind of suffering.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.605
All I'm asking for

11:33.649 --> 11:37.522
is one final act of mercy.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.830
Please.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.746
Save my friend.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.838
All right.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.100
I'll do it.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.972
Oh...

11:52.015 --> 11:54.409
Bless you, Bertie. [giggling]

11:56.367 --> 11:58.021
You know what would be nice
on this pie?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.936
-Some ice cream.
-Mm.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.112
-Sounds delicious.
-Doesn't it?

12:03.461 --> 12:04.941
Mmm.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.864
Are you glad to be back?

12:14.908 --> 12:16.518
You know I am.

12:16.561 --> 12:17.867
Ah, hey, look.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.043
It's our old pal Mr. Murphy.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.741
Oh.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.831
I forgot there was a fire escape
here. [gasps]

12:24.874 --> 12:27.921
This is the perfect place
for my photographer to hide.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.531
I hope he's patient.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.924
It's going to take
a lot of booze during dinner

12:30.967 --> 12:32.664
to get Catherine back here
for dessert.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.710
You may want
to knock a few back yourself.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.234
You'll have to be drunk
to jump those old bones.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.324
She's not so bad.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.500
Excuse me?

12:42.544 --> 12:44.459
Oh, I thought she was
an old pickle-puss at first,

12:44.502 --> 12:45.982
but once
she lets her guard down,

12:46.026 --> 12:47.636
she's actually got
a really nice smile.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.725
And she's only... what?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.074
Five years older than you?

12:53.685 --> 12:55.339
You know...

12:55.383 --> 12:58.342
this seduction doesn't have
to end in consummation.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.691
Aw, I thought
that was the whole point.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.606
No. The photo is the point.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.434
Once Catherine is naked
and on her back,

13:03.478 --> 13:04.914
you'll have hit the high note.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.395
No need to sing
the entire opera.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.266
You're jealous.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.746
Of her?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.574
Don't be preposterous.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.884
You know, I have missed
this old murphy bed.

13:17.927 --> 13:21.061
What do you say
we rechristen it?

13:21.104 --> 13:24.455
Why? So I have nothing left
in the tank for Catherine?

13:24.499 --> 13:27.458
How devious do you think I am?

13:31.941 --> 13:34.422
You've been to the gym
this morning, haven't you?

13:34.465 --> 13:35.902
Oh, what gave it away,
the muscles?

13:35.945 --> 13:37.817
[chuckles]
No, the smell.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.253
You need a shower.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.645
Oh.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.822
Well, give me five.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.607
And-and keep the motor running.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.087
[chuckles]

13:47.130 --> 13:48.392
[sputters]

13:48.436 --> 13:49.524
[door closes]

13:53.049 --> 13:54.877
You the manager here?

13:54.921 --> 13:57.793
I'm looking for a guy
who lived in 3B.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.577
I thought maybe he left
a forwarding address

13:59.621 --> 14:00.709
where he can be reached.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.015
You talking about Scooter?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.668
He moved back in this morning.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.148
He did?

14:06.193 --> 14:07.455
Oh. Ah.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.370
Well, thanks.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.636
[knock on door]

14:16.594 --> 14:18.379
Oh, it's you.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.250
Is Scooter here?

14:20.294 --> 14:21.948
I thought you
were done with him.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.994
Something's happened.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.301
And it's very important
I speak to him.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.305
Please.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.310
Oh, my God. You're pregnant.

14:36.353 --> 14:37.920
You can tell?

14:37.964 --> 14:40.227
Oh, it's all over your face.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.838
That and some
fairly cheap makeup.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.535
Nice.

14:46.102 --> 14:49.018
Oh, before I forget, I have
a message for you from my mom.

14:52.717 --> 14:53.849
You get all that?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
Or do I need to repeat it?

14:56.983 --> 14:58.419
You know what?

14:58.462 --> 15:00.900
I'll come back later
when Scoot can talk.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.599
Are you, uh, sure
you want to tell him?

15:05.600 --> 15:06.862
How can I not?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.124
It's his baby.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.605
Well, what are you hoping for?

15:10.648 --> 15:13.521
That he'll tell you
he loves you?

15:13.564 --> 15:15.349
Because he doesn't.

15:15.392 --> 15:18.047
And what if he decides to do
the right thing and marry you?

15:18.091 --> 15:21.094
You'd have two infants
to take care of instead of one.

15:21.137 --> 15:24.662
Scooter is not ready
to be a father.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.142
Or a husband.

15:26.186 --> 15:29.015
Hell, he can barely cut it
as a boyfriend.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.887
I do not want to marry Scooter.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.498
But I don't got
a lot of choices here.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.458
You'll think of something.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.590
You're too smart
to let one stupid mistake

15:39.634 --> 15:41.679
ruin the rest of your life.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.819
Congrats.

15:52.342 --> 15:53.648
He's all yours.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.911
Thank you.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.000
You know,
if you need some money...

15:58.044 --> 15:59.915
[sighs]

16:12.014 --> 16:13.929
Who was that at the door?

16:15.670 --> 16:17.541
Just a door-to-door salesman.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.978
What were they selling?

16:19.021 --> 16:20.849
Nothing we need.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.809
[moaning]

16:29.640 --> 16:31.686
Mmm.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.166
-Delicious.
-Hmm.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.428
You made my cocoa
just the way I like it.

16:34.471 --> 16:35.516
Thank you, my darling.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.344
You're very welcome, Bertie.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.129
Say, how are you
at housebreaking?

16:40.173 --> 16:41.565
What's that?

16:41.609 --> 16:43.306
You know,
picking locks and all that?

16:43.350 --> 16:44.742
I think it's best
if you visit Carlo

16:44.786 --> 16:46.440
late at night
when everyone's asleep.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.833
But have you ever broken
into a locked house before?

16:48.877 --> 16:50.705
Well, I mean, usually,
when I drop in on someone

16:50.748 --> 16:52.011
to help them,
they just open the door.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.664
Unless they're too ill
to get up,

16:53.708 --> 16:55.231
and then I find a way in.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.711
[both laughing]

16:56.754 --> 16:58.060
You're so clever.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.062
Now, it is a very,
very big house.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.064
And so, I have made you a map.

17:02.108 --> 17:05.415
Oh. Many is the time
I could have used one of these.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.591
Yes. So, Carlo's room is here.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.071
Up the stairs, take a right.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.420
Last one on the left,
not the right.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.900
-That's Rita's bedroom.
-Right.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.076
Now, the front door is
very, very solid,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.512
but if you come around the back,

17:15.556 --> 17:16.687
there are French doors
that lead into the foyer.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.428
-Is that easier?
-Oh, much.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.040
Hmm. Now, will
you have to break the glass?

17:21.083 --> 17:24.043
No. No. I can't leave any signs
of forced entry.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.870
I'd just be asking
for an autopsy.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.917
And if the police
did do an autopsy,

17:28.960 --> 17:31.267
would they find the drug
that you use?

17:31.311 --> 17:32.834
They'd have to be looking
for it.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.618
And they wouldn't be
unless they suspected foul play.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.272
-Hmm.
-And it's never happened.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.491
[chuckles]
My record is spotless.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.927
[chuckles]

17:38.970 --> 17:41.973
26 deaths, each ruled
to be by natural causes.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.758
-That's quite an accomplishment.
-Oh, thank you, darling.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.325
[both chuckle]

17:45.368 --> 17:47.066
You know,
it seems odd getting compliments

17:47.109 --> 17:48.980
for something I hid
from you for many years.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.244
I think it's good
that I know these things.

17:51.287 --> 17:54.116
Makes our marriage stronger.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.422
Yes, it does.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.772
-Yes.
-[both chuckle]

17:57.815 --> 18:00.862
Mmm. Mmm.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.907
You want me to photograph
your lover

18:02.951 --> 18:05.780
screwing your stepdaughter?

18:05.823 --> 18:09.262
If you try hard enough, you
can make anything sound sordid.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.264
Boy, you are a piece of work.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.962
This is completely justified.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.704
That crone has had it in for me
since day one.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.227
I have to fight back.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.142
By using your own gigolo
as bait?

18:20.186 --> 18:22.057
It's not like
he hasn't cheated on me before.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.278
At least he won't get
this one pregnant.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.106
Pregnant?

18:28.324 --> 18:31.153
Remember that large girl
he was seeing?

18:31.197 --> 18:35.070
She showed up at his place today
to give him the bad news.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.506
[flicks lighter]

18:36.550 --> 18:39.248
The... the waitress?

18:39.292 --> 18:40.858
She's having a baby?

18:40.902 --> 18:42.686
I convinced her
not to tell Scooter.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.820
She's not so dumb that she can't
see he'd make a lousy father.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.347
So, if you're not
going to take the photo,

18:51.391 --> 18:52.957
can you refer someone who will?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.482
Did I say I wouldn't do it?

18:55.525 --> 18:56.613
You haven't even
made me an offer yet.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.180
Oh.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.617
So, your disgust can be overcome
for the right price?

19:01.792 --> 19:04.708
Some days
money doesn't mean a lot to me.

19:04.752 --> 19:07.668
Lucky for you,
this isn't one of them.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.237
[doorbell rings]

19:12.890 --> 19:16.764
That's it.
Open up and chew slowly.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.853
[chuckles]

19:18.896 --> 19:20.420
Catherine.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.248
Your friend from
the dry cleaner is downstairs.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.510
Thanks.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.903
[grunts]

19:25.947 --> 19:28.732
Do you want one more fry
before I leave, Papa?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.561
What's wrong?

19:31.605 --> 19:33.737
Are you full?

19:34.912 --> 19:36.566
Why are you mad?

19:36.610 --> 19:38.394
Because I'm going out
for dinner?

19:38.438 --> 19:40.309
That's silly.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.224
I need to start enjoying
my life.

19:42.268 --> 19:45.358
You know, I'm not 23 anymore.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.229
I'll vouch for that.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.883
[scoffs]

19:48.926 --> 19:50.624
I won't be too late.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.235
I'll tuck you in
when I come home. Hmm?

19:57.239 --> 19:59.589
She's going to have sex tonight.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.766
With a man you don't approve of.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.596
If you hadn't threatened
to disinherit her,

20:06.640 --> 20:09.730
I wouldn't have anything
to blackmail her with.

20:09.773 --> 20:14.213
But now I can scare her
all the way back to Texas.

20:16.084 --> 20:19.218
And then it's just you and me.

20:19.261 --> 20:23.222
Doesn't that sound like fun?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.267
[chuckles]

20:50.336 --> 20:52.729
I hear
this is their best chianti.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.558
[chuckles]
But why buy the whole bottle?

20:55.602 --> 20:57.517
We won't be able
to drink it all.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.996
Oh, we got to try.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.128
It's my birthday.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.130
That's right.

21:02.173 --> 21:03.827
I almost forgot.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.877
-Oh, you got me a gift?
-Just a small token, really.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.883
Those are real diamonds.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.974
Catherine.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.280
This is too expensive.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.281
No.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.457
Didn't cost me a cent.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.198
I bought them years ago
for another man.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.765
Do you like them?

21:28.809 --> 21:30.245
I love them.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.725

So I don't get expensive gifts
for Papa anymore

22:17.901 --> 22:20.339
because I know they're
going to end up going to Rita.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.731
Now, that's your stepmother?

22:21.775 --> 22:23.559
I guess you never liked her,
huh?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.648
Well, actually,
we used to be friends,

22:25.692 --> 22:27.650
right when she and Papa
got engaged.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.391
She was nice back then.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.219
But right after the wedding,

22:31.262 --> 22:33.961
that's when Rita showed
her true colors.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.224
-She wasn't so nice anymore?
-Mm.

22:36.267 --> 22:39.227
No. You see...

22:39.270 --> 22:42.752
Rita can be sweet as pie
as long as she needs you,

22:42.796 --> 22:45.712

she no longer needs you...

22:47.017 --> 22:48.932

shows up with divorce papers.
