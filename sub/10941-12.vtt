I'm sorry.

<i>Foal's gone.</i>

take</i> <i>that blanket</i>

<i>and rub it all over</i>
<i>the new little guy,</i>

00:09.580 --> 00:11.381
then he'll smell enough
like her foal,

00:11.449 --> 00:12.850
and she'll accept him.

00:12.918 --> 00:15.452
I wanted you to know what
my intentions are with Lou.

00:15.522 --> 00:17.490
Amy: It's pretty obvious
that he loves you.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.294
I love him too,
but...

00:19.363 --> 00:21.898
I'm tired of missing him
all the time, you know?

00:21.966 --> 00:23.833
I don't see what Mom got
out of coming here.

00:23.903 --> 00:25.536
<i>I mean all we do</i>

Hey!

01:22.762 --> 01:24.230
I-I didn't expect
to see you!

01:24.299 --> 01:25.399
Yeah, I uh...

01:25.468 --> 01:26.701
Well, Scott's still
off work right,

01:26.769 --> 01:29.504
so uh, got the morning shifts
back at the track.

01:29.572 --> 01:31.773
Good! Uh, how is...
How is Scott?

01:31.843 --> 01:32.943
Oh, he's good.

01:33.013 --> 01:34.380
Um, still needs a cane
to get around,

01:34.448 --> 01:36.649
but the doctor said he's
gonna make a full recovery, so.

01:36.718 --> 01:38.386
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:40.025 --> 01:41.758
And you?
How're you doing?

01:41.827 --> 01:43.561
Good.

01:43.630 --> 01:44.562
Good.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.800

I was gonna call,

01:51.708 --> 01:53.176
Yeah, no worries.

01:54.613 --> 01:55.613
How's Daisy?

01:55.682 --> 01:57.583
Uh, not so great.

01:57.652 --> 01:59.086
(Scoffs)

01:59.156 --> 02:01.289
She hasn't been the same
since she lost her foal.

02:03.094 --> 02:04.361
Um...
(Sighs)

02:04.430 --> 02:05.463
Hey, I was just gonna run
the barrels.

02:05.532 --> 02:07.266
Do you wanna see
what she's got?

02:07.333 --> 02:08.400
Sure.

Hey, you all right?

02:32.440 --> 02:33.773
Unh! Yeah.

02:33.842 --> 02:36.377

Hey, Lou.

04:09.394 --> 04:11.395
What are you doing?

04:11.464 --> 04:13.398
Fixing the fence.

04:13.468 --> 04:16.101
Okay, well I thought you were
gonna replace the fence, Dad!

04:16.172 --> 04:17.740
It's a barbed wire fence.

04:17.807 --> 04:19.841
You know, I thought you were
gonna replace it with wood.

04:19.911 --> 04:20.944
A fence is a fence.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.547
No,
it certainly is not, dad!

04:22.616 --> 04:24.816
It's gotta go with the theme
of the dude ranch!

04:24.885 --> 04:26.286
More nature,
more woodsy.

04:26.354 --> 04:27.821
More...

04:27.890 --> 04:28.890
Wood!

04:30.428 --> 04:31.795
Wood's more expensive
to maintain,

04:31.863 --> 04:33.130
and you can't even see
the cabins from here.

04:33.198 --> 04:35.065
I don't care.

04:35.135 --> 04:36.235
And I'm standing
on my land.

04:36.305 --> 04:38.105
Well, I'm looking
at my dude ranch.

04:38.174 --> 04:39.107
That's our dude ranch.

04:39.176 --> 04:40.109
I don't care.

04:40.177 --> 04:42.744
Whatever.
It's gotta go.

04:43.749 --> 04:46.718
Jack: So where'd you go
riding so early this morning?

04:46.788 --> 04:50.023
The Ridge.
Up near Willow Springs.

04:50.092 --> 04:51.259
The cemetery?

04:51.329 --> 04:52.495
Amy:
Yeah.

04:52.564 --> 04:54.932
Yeah, I went
to visit Mom's grave.

04:54.999 --> 04:56.399
Someone had already
been there, too.

04:56.469 --> 04:57.703
They left wildflowers,

04:57.771 --> 04:58.705
her favourites.

04:58.772 --> 05:00.840
Marigolds,
asters.

05:01.911 --> 05:04.714
I haven't been up there
in quite a while.

05:04.782 --> 05:08.585
I can't believe
it's been two years.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.623
Uh, have you seen
my 100 foot tape?

05:10.692 --> 05:12.859
It's uh, missing
from my tool belt.

05:12.928 --> 05:13.995
<i>Again!</i>

05:16.267 --> 05:18.101
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Right here.</i>

05:18.170 --> 05:19.504

05:19.573 --> 05:20.806
Victor.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.108
Victor...

05:22.177 --> 05:23.344
Whitetail?

05:23.413 --> 05:24.880
Yeah.

05:24.948 --> 05:26.616
What's he doin'
around here?

05:26.684 --> 05:28.251
Uh, he said he was going
up to Priddis

05:28.320 --> 05:30.654
to do one
of his clinics.

05:32.827 --> 05:33.960
I've have to go
help your dad.

05:34.028 --> 05:35.362
Have fun!

05:36.299 --> 05:37.600
You sure
you're all right?

05:37.668 --> 05:40.670
Yeah, it's nothing.
It's just a sand burn.

05:40.739 --> 05:42.172
Let me have a look.

05:42.241 --> 05:43.609
I'm okay.

05:43.678 --> 05:45.045
All right.

05:45.114 --> 05:46.281
Wish I could say the same
for Daisy, though.

05:46.349 --> 05:47.482
She used to have
such a great attitude,

05:47.551 --> 05:49.585
but now she's like
a different horse.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.587
Sometimes horses
get depressed.

05:51.657 --> 05:53.058
It's more like
she's mad at the world.

05:53.127 --> 05:54.394
You know?

05:54.462 --> 05:56.596
She doesn't come to me
when I call her,

05:56.665 --> 05:59.534
she is mean
to the other mares.

05:59.603 --> 06:01.904
She even tried to steal
another mare's foal.

06:01.974 --> 06:02.941
That's harsh.

06:03.009 --> 06:04.143
Yeah,
tell me about it.

06:04.210 --> 06:06.478
Is there nothing
physically wrong with her?

06:06.548 --> 06:08.549
No,
she's perfectly sound.

06:08.617 --> 06:10.718
Well, maybe you
should see Amy.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.622
(Laughs)

06:12.690 --> 06:14.758
No offence,
but that's not gonna happen.

06:14.828 --> 06:16.695
Look, I know there's a lot
of flakes out there,

06:16.765 --> 06:18.298
but Amy's the real thing.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.168
Right. Yeah.
That's why she was so good

06:20.235 --> 06:22.437
at getting Daisy to bond
with that orphan foal.

06:22.506 --> 06:24.374
Come on, Kit.

06:24.444 --> 06:27.346
Just give it a try,
okay?

06:27.414 --> 06:29.382
So, ever since
Land & Country Magazine

06:29.451 --> 06:31.285
featured the dude ranch
on their website,

06:31.355 --> 06:32.621
the phone just
hasn't stopped ringing.

06:32.690 --> 06:33.555
That's great.

06:33.624 --> 06:34.824
I know, right?

06:34.892 --> 06:36.860
And they rave about
its "natural beauty".

06:36.928 --> 06:38.096
Yeah, I bet.
Hey-

06:38.164 --> 06:39.231
So what does dad do?

06:39.300 --> 06:40.500
He goes and he patches up
the fence

06:40.568 --> 06:41.869
with more barbed wire!

06:41.936 --> 06:43.371
Peter: Listen-
Lou: Barbed wire?

06:43.439 --> 06:44.839
Natural beauty?

06:44.909 --> 06:46.276
Like, what was he thinking?
It's not a penitentiary.

06:46.345 --> 06:47.445
Lou! Stop.

06:47.514 --> 06:48.714
Just for one second,
please?

06:48.782 --> 06:49.715
Sorry.

06:49.781 --> 06:51.749
I wanna ask you something.

06:51.819 --> 06:52.952
(Sighs)

06:53.823 --> 06:55.891
How's your French?

07:00.033 --> 07:01.233
(Zipper whines)

07:01.301 --> 07:03.769
What's up with
all the suitcases?

07:03.839 --> 07:06.240
Peter is taking me
to Paris!

07:07.511 --> 07:08.944
Wow!

07:09.014 --> 07:11.049
Uh, how long
are you going for?

07:11.117 --> 07:12.384
Three days.

07:12.452 --> 07:14.086
And you're taking
your whole wardrobe?

07:14.156 --> 07:17.658
No, I am buying
an entirely new wardrobe!

07:17.727 --> 07:20.329
Dior, Chanel,
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.565
Like you can afford
that stuff.

07:22.634 --> 07:25.070
As a matter of fact,
I can.

07:25.139 --> 07:27.006
Or at least,
Peter can, anyway.

07:27.077 --> 07:28.177
So it's like you shop,

07:28.244 --> 07:29.744
and he pays?

07:29.813 --> 07:30.713
Yeah!

07:30.782 --> 07:32.116
It's like a special treat.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.320
Okay? You know, his way of
saying I love you.

07:35.389 --> 07:36.956
Anyway, since when
do I have to explain

07:37.024 --> 07:38.091
these things to you?

07:38.159 --> 07:40.095
Since when were you
a kept woman?

07:41.165 --> 07:42.632
Okay, okay!

07:44.136 --> 07:45.203
Kept woman.

07:47.875 --> 07:48.942
(Zipper whines)

07:51.215 --> 07:53.282
(Tim grunts with effort)

07:53.919 --> 07:55.252
Oh, nice of you to show up.

07:55.321 --> 07:57.055
At the crack of noon.

07:57.124 --> 07:58.858
What happened to the fence?

07:58.927 --> 08:00.728
Martha Stewart
didn't like it.

08:00.796 --> 08:03.632
She wants me to build
a whole new wooden one.

08:04.202 --> 08:06.437
You want it to last?

08:06.506 --> 08:08.107
You gotta get the posts
deeper than that.

08:08.175 --> 08:11.409
Well, I'm not finished
yet, Jack.

08:15.152 --> 08:18.021
You remember...
Victor Whitetail?

08:18.959 --> 08:20.259
Yeah.

08:20.327 --> 08:22.629
The guy who used to help
Marion with Pegasus.

08:22.698 --> 08:23.631
What about him?

08:23.700 --> 08:25.067
Nothing.

08:25.136 --> 08:28.003
Heard he was in the area
doin' a horse clinic.

08:28.073 --> 08:29.140
Yeah,
I'm not surprised.

08:29.207 --> 08:30.909
He had a real way
with horses.

08:31.980 --> 08:33.147
You ever see him again?

08:33.215 --> 08:35.216
You know, after...
He worked with Pegasus?

08:35.284 --> 08:36.686
No. Lost touch.

08:37.621 --> 08:39.857
Why the hell
would that matter now?

08:43.664 --> 08:44.732
What?

08:48.238 --> 08:49.739
Did you even bother
to measure

08:49.809 --> 08:50.941
between the post holes

08:51.009 --> 08:52.076
or...

08:52.143 --> 08:54.377
were you just planning
on winging it?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.522
Ty: C'mon.
Kit: Okay.

09:01.459 --> 09:02.359
I wasn't going
to say anything,

09:02.427 --> 09:03.660
but it's like
the biggest,

09:03.730 --> 09:05.496
fattest elephant
in the room.

09:05.566 --> 09:06.933
What is?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.435
The plane crash.

09:09.504 --> 09:10.471
Uh I mean, I...

09:10.540 --> 09:12.108
I still can't even
believe it!

09:12.176 --> 09:13.309
I mean, how many people
walk away

09:13.378 --> 09:15.512
from something
like that?

09:15.581 --> 09:16.749
Like, look at you!

09:16.817 --> 09:18.551
It's amazing
you got out without a scrape.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.788
It must have been
terrifying.

09:20.858 --> 09:23.792
Well, I-it wasn't exactly
a walk in the park.

09:23.861 --> 09:26.695
I can't even imagine.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.432
Hey, is it true
what they say about your life

09:28.502 --> 09:30.771
flashing before your eyes?

09:31.706 --> 09:33.707
I-I don't know.
I don't think so.

09:33.778 --> 09:35.779
Hey, come on, Ty.

09:38.551 --> 09:39.617
Okay.

09:40.620 --> 09:41.888
When we were going down,

09:41.956 --> 09:43.523
it was like,

09:46.164 --> 09:47.764
well, it all happened
pretty fast.

09:47.833 --> 09:50.034
I didn't really have much time
to think about anything.

09:50.104 --> 09:51.271
And then...

09:51.339 --> 09:52.406
After,

09:55.211 --> 09:57.312
it was really quiet.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.949
And... for some reason,

10:00.019 --> 10:02.887
I woke up and I thought
I was on a beach.

10:02.957 --> 10:04.657
And I look over,
and I see Scott,

10:04.726 --> 10:07.161
and I cannot figure out
what he's doing.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.300
You mean like why he wasn't
wearing a bathing suit?

10:10.369 --> 10:12.069
(Laughs)

10:12.138 --> 10:13.571
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah. Sort of, I guess.</i>

10:13.640 --> 10:14.807
Amy:
Hey.

10:14.876 --> 10:16.243
Hey.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.411
Uh... Daisy, right?

10:18.481 --> 10:20.115
Ty:
Yeah.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.953
She's been having a bit of
trouble with the barrels so...

10:23.022 --> 10:24.056
Yeah, after uh,

10:24.123 --> 10:25.290
he picked me up
out of the dirt,

10:25.359 --> 10:27.092
Ty here convinced me
that you could help.

10:27.162 --> 10:29.629
(Sighs)
He did, did he?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.335
Yeah, at this point
I'm pretty much willing

10:32.403 --> 10:34.872
to give anything a try.

10:36.643 --> 10:38.245
And Amy, you're going
to have to keep track

10:38.313 --> 10:41.048
of the hours you work
with the clients' horses.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.285
Ty just dumped another one
off on me without asking.

10:44.189 --> 10:46.623
Kit's horse.
Hence the attitude.

10:46.692 --> 10:48.193
Well, just um,
make sure you fill out

10:48.262 --> 10:49.461
a client application form.

10:49.530 --> 10:51.031
And don't forget
to get a deposit.

10:51.101 --> 10:52.601
And Grandpa,

10:52.669 --> 10:54.470
you have to take the cheques
to the bank daily, okay?

10:54.538 --> 10:56.639
Well, I'm kinda busy
teaching your dad

10:56.709 --> 10:58.443
how to build a fence.

10:58.512 --> 11:00.178
Lou: Look, I know this came
right out of the blue,

11:00.248 --> 11:02.016
but it's not every day that
your boyfriend invites you

11:02.083 --> 11:04.586
to the most romantic city
in the world, so.

11:06.157 --> 11:07.357
You know what, Lou?

11:07.426 --> 11:09.060
You uh, you go.

11:09.129 --> 11:13.799
And we'll figure out a way
to take care of things here.

11:16.273 --> 11:18.441
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Hey, Ty?</i>

11:18.509 --> 11:19.709
Dinner's ready.

11:19.778 --> 11:21.246
Hold on a second!

11:27.224 --> 11:28.691
Is everything okay?

11:28.760 --> 11:29.793
Yeah.

11:31.663 --> 11:33.397
Come on, Amy.

11:33.467 --> 11:34.667
What's going on?

11:34.735 --> 11:35.802
Nothing.

11:37.207 --> 11:38.640
(Sighs)

11:38.709 --> 11:39.943
Just that I wish
you had given me

11:40.011 --> 11:41.244
some warning about Daisy.

11:41.313 --> 11:42.746
I-I know Kit's your friend,
and everything--

11:42.815 --> 11:44.083
Fine.

11:44.151 --> 11:45.085
I'll take the horse back.

11:45.153 --> 11:46.653
No, I didn't say that!

11:46.722 --> 11:48.422
I get it! Kit's horse.
You don't wanna work with her.

11:48.491 --> 11:50.525
Ty: I understand.
Amy: No, that's not-

11:50.594 --> 11:51.560
that's not it,
okay?

11:51.629 --> 11:52.796
I just have a lot
of horses,

11:52.865 --> 11:54.632
a lot of clients,
I just don't have enough time!

11:54.700 --> 11:56.234
I've got a schedule
I'm supposed to follow.

11:56.304 --> 11:57.304
Okay.

11:58.774 --> 12:01.043
It's the schedule,
it's bad timing.

12:01.112 --> 12:02.078
That's fine.

12:02.146 --> 12:03.945
No, no, it's okay.
I'll do it.

12:05.651 --> 12:07.952
You know, people think
that Paris is expensive--

12:08.023 --> 12:09.423
Not that Lou cares.

12:09.492 --> 12:10.791
<i>But really,</i>
<i>if you do your research,</i>

12:10.859 --> 12:12.260
there's tons
of great bargains.

12:12.329 --> 12:13.595
Mallory:
Not that Lou needs them.

12:13.664 --> 12:15.132
Lou:
Mallory.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.935
(Knocking on door)
Amy: I'll get it.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.204
This is our time together,

12:18.272 --> 12:20.305
and Peter just wanted
to make it special.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.309
Nothing says special like
someone else's credit card.

12:22.378 --> 12:24.079
Lou:
I'm warning you...

12:24.149 --> 12:26.216
<i>Victor:</i>
<i>Tansi, everyone.</i>

12:27.153 --> 12:28.686
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Victor!</i>

12:28.755 --> 12:30.189
Jack and I were just
talking about you today.

12:30.258 --> 12:31.358
Great to see you again.

12:31.427 --> 12:33.227
Good to see you too, Tim.

12:33.296 --> 12:35.563
<i>Come on in,</i>
<i>have a seat.</i>

12:39.921 --> 12:41.755
<i>Victor:</i>
<i>The ranch looks great, Jack.</i>

12:41.822 --> 12:43.590
Thanks.

12:43.659 --> 12:45.427
I see you got a new truck!

12:46.365 --> 12:48.132
Yeah.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.900
Saw you on the Internet,
Amy.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.437
Quite something
you did with that horse.

12:52.507 --> 12:53.807
Thanks.

12:53.876 --> 12:56.477
I'm glad to see you're
sharing your gift.

12:56.546 --> 12:58.747
Jack tells me that
you're teaching a clinic

12:58.817 --> 12:59.884
<i>somewhere around here?</i>

12:59.953 --> 13:02.054
Yeah, I thought
I'd come by early,

13:02.123 --> 13:04.590
pay my respects to Marion.

13:04.659 --> 13:05.691
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>That was you...</i>

13:05.760 --> 13:07.228
Who left the wildflowers.

13:07.297 --> 13:10.165
I always felt bad
about missing the funeral.

13:10.236 --> 13:11.403
<i>But like I told Amy,</i>

13:11.470 --> 13:14.306
<i>I was in Arizona</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

13:14.375 --> 13:16.443
So you already knew
each other?

13:16.512 --> 13:17.813
Oh, yes.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.282
<i>Since, since last year,</i>
<i>Victor helped me</i>

13:19.350 --> 13:20.650
when I was had a problem
with Spartan.

13:20.718 --> 13:22.685
Thought she was having
problems with Spartan.

13:22.754 --> 13:24.288
(Chuckles)

13:24.358 --> 13:26.993
So, what are you doing
for work now?

13:27.062 --> 13:28.528
Uh... well,

13:28.597 --> 13:31.933
tomorrow I'm starting to work
with a barrel racing horse.

13:32.004 --> 13:33.271
You could help me.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.673
Where are you,
where are you staying?

13:34.740 --> 13:37.208
Oh, I'm sure he's already
got a hotel, booked.

13:37.278 --> 13:40.046
Victor: Actually, I was
gonna sleep in my trailer.

13:40.116 --> 13:41.984
Oh! Victor,
didn't Amy tell you?

13:42.052 --> 13:43.219
Uh, we've opened
a dude ranch!

13:43.288 --> 13:45.089
And I've got
guest cabins!

13:46.026 --> 13:47.860
Well, if you have
a cabin free,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.230
I-I'd be happy
to rent one from you.

13:50.299 --> 13:51.332
Yeah!

13:51.401 --> 13:54.735
Oh, you don't have
to rent it!

14:01.083 --> 14:03.118
I shouldn'tve brought Daisy
here without asking you first.

14:03.186 --> 14:04.453
It's okay.

14:04.521 --> 14:05.587
From now on,
I'll give you a heads up.

14:05.656 --> 14:08.158
I know you have
a busy schedule.

14:08.228 --> 14:11.595
It's not just
the schedule, Ty.

14:11.666 --> 14:14.068
It's just this time
of year.

14:15.004 --> 14:16.938
Your mom?

14:17.008 --> 14:18.542
Yeah.

14:18.610 --> 14:20.278
It's been two years.

14:20.347 --> 14:22.314
And I know how
I feel about it,

14:22.383 --> 14:26.519
but... I don't know how
I'm supposed to act.

14:27.457 --> 14:28.823
I don't think there's
a particular way

14:28.892 --> 14:31.027
you're supposed to act.

14:31.097 --> 14:32.364
And I guess
it doesn't really help

14:32.433 --> 14:34.300
me piling more work
on you.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.571
No, actually,

14:36.638 --> 14:38.973
the work kinda helps.

14:40.145 --> 14:42.312
This job,
working with horses,

14:43.882 --> 14:45.684
makes me feel
close to her.

14:46.621 --> 14:47.821
(Sighs)

14:47.890 --> 14:49.458
I like that.

14:55.369 --> 14:56.703
(Truck rumbles)

15:06.319 --> 15:07.885
(Truck doors slam)

15:12.095 --> 15:14.263
I hope it isn't culturally
insensitive of me

15:14.332 --> 15:16.733
to have a teepee here?

15:18.339 --> 15:20.840
In Cree,
we call it migawap.

15:21.910 --> 15:22.977
A good reminder
to your guests

15:23.046 --> 15:25.447
that our people were,

15:25.517 --> 15:28.119
and still are,
a big part of this land.

15:28.187 --> 15:29.888
Well, that's kinda what
I was hoping

15:29.957 --> 15:31.858
when I designed
this place.

15:31.927 --> 15:33.528
You created all this?

15:33.596 --> 15:34.730
Yeah.

15:34.799 --> 15:36.232
Not the hammer
and nails part,

15:36.300 --> 15:38.134
but it was my idea.

15:38.203 --> 15:40.571
Victor: My grandmother
always said that the women

15:40.641 --> 15:42.508
were like the sacred fire

15:42.577 --> 15:45.212
in the center
of the migawap,

15:45.281 --> 15:46.982
well, because they
brought warmth

15:47.052 --> 15:50.320
and comfort
to their families.

15:50.390 --> 15:52.058
I like that.

15:52.126 --> 15:55.194
You have your
mother's spirit.

15:57.301 --> 15:58.835
Looks like
you're the fire

15:58.903 --> 16:02.405
in the middle
of your family now.

16:02.475 --> 16:04.376
I like that too.

16:10.021 --> 16:12.255
Thanks for the lift.

16:16.598 --> 16:17.865
Amy:
(Clicking tongue)

16:17.934 --> 16:19.500
Come on!

16:19.970 --> 16:23.405
<i>Victor:</i> <i>The horse has</i>
<i>an intelligent eye.</i>

16:23.475 --> 16:26.243
<i>But you can see her heart</i>
<i>just isn't into it.</i>

16:26.312 --> 16:27.179
Amy:
Come on!

16:27.248 --> 16:28.782
(Daisy snorts)

16:28.851 --> 16:29.683
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Well, she used to
be</i> <i>a prize winning</i>

16:29.752 --> 16:31.485
<i>barrel racing horse.</i>

16:31.554 --> 16:33.655
But a few months ago
she uh...

16:33.725 --> 16:34.892
She lost her foal.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.527
And ever since then,

16:36.596 --> 16:40.099
my friend Kit's been having
a hard time with her.

16:40.169 --> 16:42.236
If your friend
is so concerned,

16:42.305 --> 16:45.574
<i>why isn't she here</i>
<i>working with Amy?</i>

16:45.643 --> 16:47.944
It's uh... complicated.

16:48.014 --> 16:49.681
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

16:50.953 --> 16:51.987
Oh, I see.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.993
Kit is your friend,

16:57.897 --> 16:59.630
but not Amy's.

17:01.035 --> 17:02.769
That is complicated.

17:04.740 --> 17:05.674
(Daisy pants)

17:05.742 --> 17:07.109
Tim:
(Straining)

17:07.179 --> 17:08.244
I couldn't help
but notice

17:08.313 --> 17:09.613
you weren't your same
jovial self

17:09.682 --> 17:11.382
at dinner last night,
Jack.

17:11.452 --> 17:13.219
Well, one too many
freeloaders

17:13.288 --> 17:15.255
at the table
for my taste.

17:15.324 --> 17:16.656
Why didn't anybody
tell me

17:16.726 --> 17:18.828
that Amy took Spartan
to Victor last year?

17:18.896 --> 17:20.964
It's not my job to give you
a play by play

17:21.034 --> 17:22.901
of your daughter's life.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.502
So, I guess
it's not your job

17:24.571 --> 17:25.839
to tell me
how Victor knew

17:25.907 --> 17:27.709
what Marion's favourite
flowers were, either?

17:27.778 --> 17:28.812
That's right.

17:28.879 --> 17:30.012
You gonna talk all day,

17:30.081 --> 17:32.782
or you gonna dig
the damn hole?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.354
Dig the hole.

17:36.225 --> 17:37.758
So the next step
is to put up the barrels

17:37.826 --> 17:39.493
and run the pattern
at an easy pace.

17:39.563 --> 17:43.166
But I don't know
if Daisy's ready for that yet.

17:43.237 --> 17:44.703
Okey-dokey.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.707
Uh, unless you think
she is?

17:49.645 --> 17:50.779
She looks like
a strong horse,

17:50.848 --> 17:53.083
I bet she's up
to anything.

17:53.150 --> 17:54.417
Ready to run the barrels?

17:54.486 --> 17:57.588
Well, if you think
her heart's in it.

17:57.658 --> 17:59.159
Yeah,
you're probably right.

17:59.228 --> 18:01.028
Maybe it's too soon.

18:01.097 --> 18:03.765
So, what should I do?

18:03.834 --> 18:05.635
Come for a walk.

18:06.572 --> 18:07.706
A walk?

18:07.775 --> 18:09.842
(Sighs)
Of course.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.480
Amy: Don't get me wrong Victor,

18:12.549 --> 18:15.151
but I've got
a lot of work to do.

18:15.221 --> 18:17.121
Victor:
You're a busy girl.

18:17.188 --> 18:18.855
We may be walking
out in this field,

18:18.926 --> 18:20.993
but your mind
is still with the horses.

18:21.062 --> 18:21.995
Amy:
I can't help it.

18:22.064 --> 18:24.365
That's just the way I am.

18:24.434 --> 18:26.201
So that uh,
horse on the Internet,

18:26.270 --> 18:27.537
the one you saved?

18:27.605 --> 18:30.441
Yeah? How did you
know what to do then?

18:30.511 --> 18:31.611
I don't know.

18:31.679 --> 18:35.315
I guess I just
reached out to him.

18:35.385 --> 18:36.452
Oh, so uh...

18:36.519 --> 18:37.519
Uh...

18:39.057 --> 18:40.324
You used your heart.

18:40.392 --> 18:42.327
You trusted yourself.

18:43.265 --> 18:44.265
Yeah.

18:44.334 --> 18:46.401
Yeah, I guess.

18:46.470 --> 18:50.372
So, um, how come when
you're with Daisy,

18:53.213 --> 18:54.847
you're second guessing
yourself?

18:54.915 --> 18:57.384
Uh... asking questions.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.956
I don't know.

19:00.893 --> 19:03.228
Well, I think you do.

19:08.838 --> 19:11.073
I can't believe we're going
to Paris tomorrow!

19:11.142 --> 19:13.943
Yeah! I wish it was for more
than just a couple days.

19:14.014 --> 19:15.680
You've obviously
never seen me shop.

19:15.749 --> 19:17.617
I can do a lot of damage
in three days.

19:17.685 --> 19:19.920
(Laughing)
Yeah, I bet you can!

19:19.989 --> 19:21.622
I booked us a hotel room!

19:21.691 --> 19:22.892
What?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.495
I know!
It's the Hotel Vaillancourt!

19:24.563 --> 19:25.796
Peter: No, no, no, Lou-
Lou: Listen, listen-

19:25.864 --> 19:26.964
listen, it's right out
of the movies.

19:27.034 --> 19:28.334
It has a view
of the Eiffel Tower.

19:28.403 --> 19:30.370
Sweetheart,
I already booked us a room!

19:30.440 --> 19:31.340
Lou: Oh!
Peter: Yeah.

19:31.408 --> 19:32.474
And it's at the same hotel

19:32.542 --> 19:34.309
the conference
is being held at, so.

19:34.379 --> 19:35.779
The conference?
Honey, don't worry about the hotel.

19:35.848 --> 19:36.814
You're gonna love it.

19:36.883 --> 19:38.116
Okay?
It's a five-star,

19:38.185 --> 19:39.685
it's got all the bells
and whistles,

19:39.754 --> 19:42.822
and it's right in the heart
of the business district.

19:42.891 --> 19:43.958
The business district?

19:44.027 --> 19:45.361
(Laughs)

19:46.098 --> 19:49.367
Yes. But we'll have
all our evenings free together.

19:49.437 --> 19:51.104
And during the day
you'll be so busy shopping,

19:51.173 --> 19:54.074
you won't even realize
I'm not around.

19:54.143 --> 19:55.210
Great.

19:58.183 --> 20:00.084
(Barrel scrapes along)

20:00.921 --> 20:02.021
Amy:
Thanks, Ty.

20:02.090 --> 20:03.623
Just a little bit more,
I think.

20:03.692 --> 20:05.193
Tim: While barrel racing
wasn't my specialty,

20:05.261 --> 20:08.063
but I know a thing or two
about rodeo horses.

20:08.133 --> 20:09.299
Amy: I think I've got
it under control.

20:09.367 --> 20:10.234
Thanks, Dad.

20:10.303 --> 20:13.205
Last year?
With Spartan?

20:13.273 --> 20:15.308
<i>What made you wanna</i>
<i>take him to Victor?</i>

20:15.377 --> 20:17.678
I'm surprised
you remember him.

20:17.748 --> 20:19.983
You were only about five
when your mom

20:20.051 --> 20:22.920
was asking him for help
with Pegasus.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.557
Well, I didn't really
remember him.

20:24.626 --> 20:26.126
Actually I just saw something
in one of Mom's journals,

20:26.193 --> 20:27.393
and I don't know,

20:27.462 --> 20:30.097
<i>it made me think</i>
<i>he could help.</i>

20:31.035 --> 20:34.438
I'm... a little busy though.
If...

20:35.809 --> 20:37.677
Yeah. Me too.

20:37.746 --> 20:38.979
(Daisy snorts)

20:50.466 --> 20:52.800
Dad, what's going on?

20:54.306 --> 20:56.874
I don't know, Lou.
Why don't you tell me.

20:56.942 --> 21:00.077
To my courageous
warrior woman.

21:01.184 --> 21:02.850
Love, Victor.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.122
What do you know
about this?

21:17.020 --> 21:18.353
<i>So how close were they,</i>
<i>exactly?</i>

21:18.422 --> 21:19.955
How often did your mother
go and see him?

21:20.025 --> 21:21.825
I was 14 or 15, Dad!

21:21.894 --> 21:22.894
I don't remember.

21:22.962 --> 21:24.195
Tim:
Once? Was it twice?

21:24.264 --> 21:25.297
Was it every weekend?
What do you remember?

21:25.366 --> 21:27.835
I honestly don't remember,
okay?

21:27.904 --> 21:30.005
Look, Mom and Victor spent
a lot of time together

21:30.073 --> 21:31.340
working on Pegasus.

21:31.409 --> 21:32.910
And then,
he was out of the picture.

21:32.979 --> 21:34.613
T-I think there was a lot
more to it than that, Lou.

21:34.681 --> 21:36.348
Dad!

21:36.417 --> 21:38.183
I mean, ever since
Victor's shown up,

21:38.253 --> 21:40.187
Jack's been acting strange,
so has Amy,

21:40.256 --> 21:41.590
there's something
you're not telling me!

21:41.660 --> 21:44.261
Dad! You're reading
way too much into this, okay?

21:44.329 --> 21:45.931
Mom and Victor
were friends

21:45.999 --> 21:47.366
and that was it.

21:47.435 --> 21:49.235
Just let it go.

21:55.413 --> 21:56.781
<i>Victor:</i>
<i>That's it, my girl!</i>

21:56.849 --> 21:58.684
You've got it!

21:59.286 --> 22:01.621
<i>Amy:</i> <i>You were right, she is
more</i> <i>relaxed without the bit.</i>

22:01.691 --> 22:03.491
<i>Victor:</i>
<i>Well done, Amy!</i>

22:03.561 --> 22:05.228
<i>You're listening</i>
<i>to that four-legged</i>

22:05.296 --> 22:07.430
with your whole heart!

22:07.500 --> 22:08.666
(Laughs)

22:08.735 --> 22:09.835
Good girl!

22:09.904 --> 22:11.337
Yes, you are!

22:11.406 --> 22:12.673
Good girl!

22:13.241 --> 22:15.509
Well, uh,
I mean she knows the pattern.

22:15.579 --> 22:17.313
And as long
as I don't force her...

22:17.382 --> 22:19.050
And when she's ready,

22:19.119 --> 22:21.087
you let her fly.

22:21.154 --> 22:23.089
<i>She'll do it</i>
<i>because she wants to,</i>

22:23.158 --> 22:25.325
not because she has to.

22:25.394 --> 22:26.929
Thanks, Victor.

22:26.998 --> 22:29.232
What are you
thanking me for?

22:29.300 --> 22:30.367
You're the one
in the saddle.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.737
(Laughs)

22:31.805 --> 22:33.072
Victor: Get out there
and do it again!

22:33.141 --> 22:34.574
Amy:
Okay.

22:35.544 --> 22:38.847
<i>Victor:</i>
<i>Let her rip, potato chip!</i>

22:44.391 --> 22:47.027
It's good to see Pegasus
looking so good.

22:47.096 --> 22:50.832
Yeah, he really seems
to remember you.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.572
You did some great work
with Daisy today.

22:54.642 --> 22:55.542
(Gate squeals)

22:55.609 --> 22:56.976
Amy:
Thanks.

22:57.046 --> 22:58.612
(Gate clicks shut)

22:58.681 --> 23:01.315
But now you have to bring
her rider

23:01.385 --> 23:04.054
into the healing
process.

23:04.658 --> 23:08.761
Kit and I, we don't really think
the same way about horses.

23:08.831 --> 23:13.067
The only thing we seem
to have in common is Ty.

23:14.438 --> 23:17.774
Amy, if you wanna do
this kind of work,

23:17.845 --> 23:21.881
you have to put your personal
feelings aside.

23:21.951 --> 23:24.285
You know, your mom...

23:25.324 --> 23:28.626
She always used to put
the horse first.

23:28.696 --> 23:29.829
I know.

23:33.636 --> 23:35.104
I miss her.

23:36.374 --> 23:37.608
So do I.

23:40.381 --> 23:41.414
Sometimes I walk
out of the barn

23:41.482 --> 23:44.084
and I just expect her
to be there.

23:44.154 --> 23:47.488
It's like I forget,
or something.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.094
I don't know, maybe 'cause
I was in the hospital

23:50.163 --> 23:53.265
when they had her funeral,
but...

23:53.334 --> 23:57.471
It just feels like
something's... unfinished.

23:57.541 --> 24:01.543
Maybe you should do
something about that.

24:07.523 --> 24:08.456
What do you think?

24:08.525 --> 24:09.993
Too countrified?

24:10.061 --> 24:11.495
Well, I thought you were
going there to shop.

24:11.563 --> 24:14.499
Yeah I am, but I've gotta wear
something on the plane.

24:14.568 --> 24:15.568
(Amy sighs)

24:16.438 --> 24:18.005
Not that Peter
is gonna notice.

24:18.073 --> 24:20.875
He'll probably have his laptop
open the whole time.

24:20.945 --> 24:22.979
I thought this was supposed
to be a romantic getaway

24:23.048 --> 24:24.148
<i>for you two?</i>

24:24.217 --> 24:25.984
Oh no,
it's a business trip.

24:26.053 --> 24:27.053
Oh.

24:29.359 --> 24:30.860
Hey Lou, uh...

24:30.928 --> 24:32.494
<i>So I was talking</i>
<i>to Victor...</i>

24:32.563 --> 24:33.596
About mom.

24:33.665 --> 24:35.232
And...

24:35.302 --> 24:38.003
I was thinking maybe we should
do some kind of ceremony,

24:38.072 --> 24:39.673
with the whole family?

24:39.742 --> 24:41.242
Like what?

24:41.311 --> 24:42.812
I don't know,
maybe go on a ride,

24:42.881 --> 24:45.516
to one of her favourite places,
or something.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.153
That's a great idea,
we'll do it when I get back?

24:48.223 --> 24:49.689
Umm...

24:49.758 --> 24:52.727
Yeah, the thing is,
Victor won't be here then.

24:52.795 --> 24:53.995
Victor?

24:54.064 --> 24:56.265
I thought you said
this was for the family.

24:56.335 --> 24:57.902
It is, um...

24:59.240 --> 25:00.807
It's just...

25:01.810 --> 25:03.277
<i>(Sighs deeply)</i>

25:03.347 --> 25:05.982
Mom and Victor were
a lot more than just friends.

25:07.888 --> 25:08.954
Oh.

25:11.626 --> 25:13.660
Grampa,
it's been two years.

25:13.730 --> 25:15.265
I mean,
last year felt too soon,

25:15.333 --> 25:18.002
but this year feels
like the right time.

25:18.070 --> 25:21.006
I'm not sure there ever
will be a right time.

25:21.076 --> 25:23.043
But one thing
I do know for sure,

25:23.112 --> 25:24.578
I don't need
Victor Whitetail

25:24.646 --> 25:26.847
tellin' me how
to remember my daughter.

25:26.918 --> 25:30.486
Well, actually the ride
was my idea.

25:31.825 --> 25:34.427
The timing's bad,
Amy.

25:34.496 --> 25:36.398
Lou's going away,

25:36.467 --> 25:38.100
there's work
to be done.

25:38.169 --> 25:39.403
Grandpa,
this isn't about Lou,

25:39.470 --> 25:40.537
or work.

25:40.605 --> 25:42.240
This is about
your issue with Victor.

25:42.309 --> 25:43.642
Issue.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.212
Yeah well,
that's one way of putting it.

25:46.281 --> 25:49.183
Grampa,
I know all about it.

25:49.254 --> 25:50.354
About Mom and Victor.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.158
It doesn't have to be
a big secret.

25:53.227 --> 25:54.526
Well, maybe.

25:54.594 --> 25:55.894
But I'm pretty sure
this isn't something

25:55.964 --> 25:59.466
I wanna be talkin' about
with my granddaughter.

25:59.536 --> 26:00.603
Great.

26:01.273 --> 26:02.906
(Truck rumbles up)

26:02.975 --> 26:06.310
My day just keeps
getting better.

26:07.049 --> 26:08.383
Mine too.

26:11.021 --> 26:12.588
(Truck door slams)

26:16.863 --> 26:18.097
So I started working her
on a lunge line,

26:18.165 --> 26:19.799
just to take
the pressure off.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.903
Pressure?
What do you mean?

26:21.972 --> 26:23.539
Well, I don't know.
Um...

26:23.609 --> 26:25.310
The bit you're using's
kinda severe,

26:25.378 --> 26:27.511
so I thought maybe you could
try something a bit softer.

26:27.580 --> 26:29.882
You wanna change up
my horse's tack?

26:29.951 --> 26:31.252
Well, I just think
a correctional bit

26:31.321 --> 26:32.921
probably isn't the best
way to go.

26:32.989 --> 26:35.024
I've Al-I've always uh,
used it!

26:35.093 --> 26:36.394
Yesterday,
I got around the barrels

26:36.462 --> 26:39.464
with just a halter,
no bit at all.

26:39.534 --> 26:40.934
Okay.

26:41.002 --> 26:42.468
I-I'm just saying
give it a try.

26:42.537 --> 26:43.904
You know,
I-I don't know,

26:43.972 --> 26:45.706
maybe just ride her
a little more fluid,

26:45.776 --> 26:46.910
<i>and a little softer.</i>

26:46.978 --> 26:48.079
Oh! Wow!

26:48.147 --> 26:49.247
So this isn't just
about the bit,

26:49.315 --> 26:51.483
you wanna teach me
how to ride?!

26:51.552 --> 26:54.454
D-do you have any idea how many
buckles I've won on this horse?

26:54.525 --> 26:55.925
Kit, that's not
what this is about.

26:55.992 --> 26:57.960
You know what?
I knew this wasn't gonna work.

26:58.030 --> 27:00.464
You don't like me,
you made that pretty obvious.

27:00.533 --> 27:01.799
You know what?
You're one of those girls,

27:01.869 --> 27:03.070
you just can't stand
the fact

27:03.137 --> 27:05.273
that I'm still friends
with your boyfriend!

27:06.342 --> 27:07.742
You know what?
I'm done.

27:07.811 --> 27:11.247
Okay? I'll be back
to pick up my horse.

27:11.317 --> 27:12.717
(Horse snorting)

27:13.754 --> 27:15.054
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Hey Kit, where you going?</i>

27:15.123 --> 27:16.390
(Kit sighs)

27:16.459 --> 27:17.392
Hey, wait up.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.395
Look!
I gave it a try, okay?

27:19.463 --> 27:21.230
But that "miracle girl"
video has gone to her head.

27:21.300 --> 27:25.503
I'm surprised that she can
even fit a cowboy hat on it!

27:25.573 --> 27:28.708
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Hey, Kit!</i> <i>Hold on a second!</i>

27:28.778 --> 27:30.845
She is definitely getting
somewhere with your horse!

27:30.914 --> 27:32.482
You know what?
I don't need a horse healer

27:32.551 --> 27:33.784
trying to teach me
how to ride!

27:33.852 --> 27:34.986
She's trying to help!

27:35.054 --> 27:37.656
Look, I appreciate
what you tried to do,

27:37.726 --> 27:40.461
but Amy and me,
is not gonna happen.

27:40.531 --> 27:42.465
(Truck starts up)

27:42.533 --> 27:44.334
(Trucks rumbles away)

27:49.009 --> 27:50.643
(Tractor rumbles)

27:50.712 --> 27:52.213
I saw Amy and Victor

27:52.282 --> 27:54.016
workin' with that barrel
racing horse yesterday.

27:54.084 --> 27:55.285
Oh...

27:55.354 --> 27:57.087
Amy seems to get along
with the guy.

27:57.157 --> 28:00.058
Yeah well, I guess
she's learning a lot from him.

28:00.128 --> 28:02.129
Yeah, I guess so.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.732
I'll-I'll be happy
to see the last of him.

28:04.801 --> 28:06.235
Yep, me too.

28:07.173 --> 28:09.641
You know,

28:09.710 --> 28:12.579
he's got Amy planning
some memorial service

28:12.648 --> 28:14.114
for Marion.

28:15.186 --> 28:19.254
Well, what the hell
business is that of his?

28:19.324 --> 28:20.357
<i>Huh?</i>

28:22.297 --> 28:24.130
There's something
you're not telling me.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.466
I'll see you back
at the dude ranch.

28:25.535 --> 28:26.669
(Truck starts)

28:26.736 --> 28:28.870
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Jack, come on!</i>

28:29.541 --> 28:30.741
(Truck rumbles away)

28:31.745 --> 28:32.878
Dammit!

28:36.586 --> 28:38.220
(Truck door slams)

28:38.288 --> 28:39.422
(Claps)

28:41.093 --> 28:42.627
Bonjour, ma belle!

28:42.696 --> 28:44.062
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

28:44.131 --> 28:45.498
(Peter laughs)

28:45.567 --> 28:46.667
Where's your luggage,
baby?

28:46.736 --> 28:48.203
You're traveling
aweully light!

28:48.272 --> 28:50.106
(Sighs)
Yeah.

28:50.173 --> 28:51.573
No, um...

28:52.477 --> 28:54.111
I'm not coming.

28:54.948 --> 28:55.948
What?

28:56.016 --> 28:57.551
I know,
I should've called first,

28:57.619 --> 29:00.454
but I wanted to talk
to you about it.

29:00.524 --> 29:02.191
It's the conference thing,
isn't it?

29:02.261 --> 29:03.261
You know, I should've told you
about that right off the bat.

29:03.329 --> 29:04.829
No, it's not that.

29:04.897 --> 29:06.731
The credit card was just me
trying to make up for it.

29:06.799 --> 29:07.999
You're obviously not
that kind of girl.

29:08.068 --> 29:09.702
Well, I could be
that kind of girl.

29:09.772 --> 29:11.005
(Laughs)

29:11.074 --> 29:14.209
I mean, it's not that.
Listen um...

29:14.279 --> 29:17.847
When... when my mom died
two years ago,

29:17.918 --> 29:20.019
Amy couldn't be a part
of the funeral.

29:20.088 --> 29:23.590
So she wants to have
this memorial service.

29:23.661 --> 29:25.161
And babe,
I need to be there.

29:25.229 --> 29:28.198
It's-it's really important
for my family.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.367
I'm sorry.

29:29.436 --> 29:30.903
Yeah.
No, it's okay.

29:30.971 --> 29:32.406
I mean,
I-I totally get that.

29:32.475 --> 29:35.076
I... (Laughs) I just wish
you would'a told me!

29:35.145 --> 29:37.046
I know, but it was just
at the last minute.

29:37.115 --> 29:39.215
I like to be a part
of it.

29:39.285 --> 29:41.986
Um...
But whatever, um, I...

29:42.056 --> 29:44.191
Unfortunately do really
have to be at this conference.

29:44.259 --> 29:46.661
I can't miss it, so...

29:47.565 --> 29:49.866
You're gonna miss
your flight.

29:49.936 --> 29:51.403
Yeah. Okay.

29:54.476 --> 29:56.610
(Truck rumbles to a stop)

30:02.823 --> 30:04.724
(Truck door slams)

30:06.929 --> 30:07.896
(Banging)

30:09.333 --> 30:10.466
Victor!

30:14.541 --> 30:15.675
Victor!

30:19.048 --> 30:20.983
<i>Victor:</i>
<i>Tansi, Tim.</i>

30:21.051 --> 30:23.453
I was just smudging out
the migawap.

30:23.523 --> 30:25.424
- Care to join me?
- No!

30:26.361 --> 30:27.694
What do you want?

30:27.763 --> 30:31.331
What are you doing here, Victor?

30:31.402 --> 30:32.668
Your daughter has a gift.

30:32.737 --> 30:35.038
You think
I don't know that?

30:35.108 --> 30:36.308
It's why I'm here.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.743
To see how Amy's doing,

30:37.812 --> 30:40.647
and uh, to pay my respects
to Marion.

30:40.717 --> 30:42.150
Marion.

30:42.753 --> 30:44.521
What the hell did you have
going on with Marion?

30:44.588 --> 30:45.688
Now, hold on Tim.

30:45.757 --> 30:46.957
It's not what you think.

30:47.026 --> 30:49.294
No, I think it is, Victor.

30:49.363 --> 30:50.697
I think while
I was wracked up,

30:50.766 --> 30:53.735
you were making a move
on my wife!

30:54.672 --> 30:57.707
It was a long time ago, Tim.

30:57.777 --> 30:59.744
And that's not
how it happened.

30:59.813 --> 31:01.179
Spare me the details.

31:01.248 --> 31:02.415
Do yourself a favour.

31:02.484 --> 31:03.684
You've seen Amy,

31:03.753 --> 31:06.588
you brought your flowers
for Marion.

31:06.657 --> 31:07.790
First thing tomorrow,

31:07.859 --> 31:10.961
I want you the hell
out of here!

31:11.900 --> 31:12.967
Clear?

31:19.590 --> 31:21.423
Take care of yourself.

31:21.492 --> 31:24.027
Hope to see you
again sometime.

31:24.964 --> 31:25.898
What's he doing?

31:25.966 --> 31:27.801
Let me handle this.

31:28.704 --> 31:30.272
Victor!

31:30.339 --> 31:32.473
You going somewhere?

31:33.411 --> 31:35.813
I think it's time for me
to move on.

31:35.882 --> 31:37.282
What about the ceremony?

31:37.349 --> 31:38.983
You don't need me.

31:39.921 --> 31:41.254
You'll know what to do,

31:41.324 --> 31:42.657
just listen
to your heart,

31:42.726 --> 31:45.328
like you do when you're working
with a four-legged.

31:45.396 --> 31:48.232
It's not that easy
for me.

31:48.302 --> 31:50.469
The thing that made
your mom's gift real

31:50.539 --> 31:53.407
was the way that she
shared it with others.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.944
<i>You still have to learn</i>
<i>to put aside your differences</i>

31:56.013 --> 31:57.715
and focus on one thing.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.117
(Sighs)
The horse.

32:00.186 --> 32:03.789
You know, even before
I met your mom,

32:03.860 --> 32:06.695
I saw her at this colt
starting competition.

32:06.766 --> 32:08.032
Yeah,
I remember those.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.767
She used to take me
when I was little.

32:09.836 --> 32:12.337
They give you three days
to gentle an unbroke horse.

32:12.407 --> 32:13.774
(Laughs)

32:13.843 --> 32:16.277
It really separates
the men from the boys,

32:16.346 --> 32:17.946
and the girls.

32:18.015 --> 32:21.985
Your mom was one
of the first women to do it.

32:22.056 --> 32:23.691
You could do it too.

32:23.759 --> 32:25.359
I don't think
I'm ready for that.

32:25.427 --> 32:28.562
It opened up
a lot of doors for her.

32:28.633 --> 32:30.967
It could for you too.

32:32.939 --> 32:34.072
(Sighs)

32:36.212 --> 32:38.747
Did you know that Victor guy
was leaving?

32:38.816 --> 32:39.949
What? Why?

32:40.886 --> 32:42.218
I don't know
all the details.

32:42.287 --> 32:44.021
In fact, I don't know
any of the details,

32:44.090 --> 32:46.893
but I'm pretty sure
it wasn't his idea, though.

32:46.961 --> 32:48.161
(Sighs)

32:48.230 --> 32:50.932
I'm pretty sure
I know whose idea it was.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.973
<i>(Saw whirs)</i>

32:55.041 --> 32:57.175
(Truck rumbles to a stop)

32:58.313 --> 32:59.780
<i>(Saw whirs)</i>

33:01.484 --> 33:02.551
(Door slams)

33:05.926 --> 33:07.192
Agh!

33:07.261 --> 33:09.262
I canceled my trip to Paris
for this memorial,

33:09.331 --> 33:10.932
because it means
a lot to me.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.300
And it means
a lot to Amy.

33:12.369 --> 33:13.769
And if Amy wants
Victor to come,

33:13.838 --> 33:15.137
then he's coming.

33:15.206 --> 33:16.273
But Dad, if you
don't like the guest list,

33:16.341 --> 33:17.775
you don't need
to be there.

33:17.844 --> 33:18.910
<i>Okay?</i>

33:20.515 --> 33:22.315
You mind telling me
what that was all about?

33:22.385 --> 33:23.752
I had words with Victor.

33:23.821 --> 33:24.855
Words?

33:24.922 --> 33:25.889
Yeah,
and it's your fault.

33:25.958 --> 33:27.157
It's my fault?

33:27.226 --> 33:28.627
You could've told me
what was going on

33:28.696 --> 33:30.229
between the two of 'em.
You could've given me a clue!

33:30.298 --> 33:32.032
Yeah, yeah,
I could've!

33:32.100 --> 33:33.500
Yeah,
but you didn't, Jack!

33:33.569 --> 33:35.304
<i>He was moving in</i>
<i>on my wife!</i>

33:35.373 --> 33:38.274
A wife you already deserted!

33:40.214 --> 33:42.482
But maybe you don't
remember.

33:42.551 --> 33:44.819
While you were off
popping pills,

33:44.888 --> 33:47.222
and drinking yourself
into oblivion,

33:47.290 --> 33:49.758
Victor was helping Marion
heal your horse!

33:49.828 --> 33:51.396
So that gives him
the right to just go and-

33:51.465 --> 33:53.533
I am not finished!

33:55.204 --> 33:56.938
When I got sick
of waiting for you

33:57.007 --> 33:59.308
to be a father
to those girls,

33:59.378 --> 34:02.812
and a husband
to my daughter,

34:02.882 --> 34:05.518
I kicked your
sorry butt out.

34:05.587 --> 34:07.088
I hoped it might be
a wake up call

34:07.157 --> 34:09.391
for you to clean up your act
and come back home.

34:09.460 --> 34:11.529
<i>But you never did!</i>

34:12.598 --> 34:14.331
So the way I figure it,

34:14.402 --> 34:16.603
whatever happened
between Marion and Victor

34:16.672 --> 34:19.739
is none of your damn
business!

34:23.349 --> 34:24.916
(Truck rumbles up)

34:34.331 --> 34:35.399
Tim?

34:37.170 --> 34:40.839
Something I want you to know.

34:42.312 --> 34:43.878
The fact is,

34:44.681 --> 34:48.119
Marion and I
were just good friends.

34:49.056 --> 34:51.956
I guess I hoped
it might become something else,

34:52.027 --> 34:57.198
but she told me she couldn't
open her heart to another.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.470
Said it still
belonged to you.

34:59.540 --> 35:01.774
And it always would.

35:03.712 --> 35:04.746
Okay.

35:10.857 --> 35:11.923
Hey.

35:14.062 --> 35:16.164
Maybe you should
stick around,

35:16.233 --> 35:18.968
be a part of the memorial.

35:20.674 --> 35:22.074
It's uh...

35:24.045 --> 35:27.947
Well, it'd be important
to my daughters.

35:33.528 --> 35:35.429
I'd be honoured.

35:39.670 --> 35:40.903

35:55.429 --> 35:56.929
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

35:56.996 --> 35:58.197
That's my horse,
I wanna pick her up.

35:58.266 --> 35:59.833
What are they doing?

35:59.901 --> 36:01.068
Kit, you gotta see this.

36:01.137 --> 36:02.170
<i>Victor:</i>
<i>That's it, girl!</i>

36:02.240 --> 36:03.473

<i>Victor:</i>
<i>Come on, Amy!</i>

36:09.918 --> 36:12.185
Kit: Okay, so there's
no bit in her mouth.

36:12.255 --> 36:14.322
Victor:
Okay, now relax.

36:15.159 --> 36:16.660
<i>That's it, my girl!</i>

36:16.729 --> 36:17.729
<i>No pressure!</i>

36:17.797 --> 36:19.665
<i>Let her find her own way!</i>

36:19.734 --> 36:21.601
Amy:
Just like this?

36:21.670 --> 36:22.803
Victor:
Yea

36:24.542 --> 36:25.876
yes, that's it!

36:25.944 --> 36:27.344
Now let her fly!

36:33.990 --> 36:35.391
(Hooves thunder)

36:41.536 --> 36:43.436
(Laughing)
Yeah!

36:46.610 --> 36:47.576
Yeah, all right.

36:47.645 --> 36:48.978
I get it.

36:51.016 --> 36:52.249
(Gate squeaks)

36:54.323 --> 36:57.157
Look, I know we don't
work the same way,

36:57.227 --> 36:59.994
different... philosophies,
or whatever.

37:00.063 --> 37:04.467
Um, but any idiot can see that
you can help me with Daisy.

37:07.042 --> 37:08.108
Okay.

37:09.146 --> 37:10.213
Okay.

37:11.383 --> 37:12.516
Thanks.

37:13.152 --> 37:14.485
Come on, Daisy.

37:22.233 --> 37:23.633
(Horse snorts)

37:27.509 --> 37:29.910
Amy: So I was thinking we could
ride along Three Point Creek

37:29.979 --> 37:31.379
up to Bucking Horse Hill.

37:31.447 --> 37:34.383
I know the place,
it sounds real nice.

37:34.452 --> 37:35.386
Amy, I...

37:35.454 --> 37:37.621
I know I fought you
on this,

37:37.690 --> 37:39.724
but I'm glad you won.

37:39.794 --> 37:40.794
Thanks.

37:41.764 --> 37:42.864
Everybody ready?

37:42.933 --> 37:44.333
(SUV rumbles up)

37:46.037 --> 37:47.170
Peter?!

37:49.710 --> 37:52.545
Peter,
what are you doing here?

37:52.615 --> 37:53.948
I uh...

37:54.017 --> 37:55.884
I was waiting for my
connecting flight in Montreal,

37:55.953 --> 37:58.254
and I realized that...

37:58.324 --> 38:02.360
Paris just isn't where
I wanna be right now.

38:03.598 --> 38:05.066
So...

38:05.135 --> 38:07.069

40:32.110 --> 40:33.610
I know the way
you can talk to her,

40:33.679 --> 40:36.646
about things that-that you keep
all bottled up inside,

40:36.716 --> 40:37.950
things that you
don't tell me,

40:38.019 --> 40:38.986
and I don't know
what's wrong with me,

40:39.053 --> 40:41.588
No, it's not you, Amy.

40:41.657 --> 40:43.625
Kit just asks
a lot of questions.

40:43.695 --> 40:44.828
And if I don't give her
answers,

40:44.898 --> 40:47.866
she just keeps bugging me.

40:47.935 --> 40:51.004
It has nothing
to do with you.

40:52.175 --> 40:55.744
So you're saying
it's my fault then?

40:56.215 --> 40:58.016
That I don't...
bug you enough?

40:58.084 --> 40:59.251
(Laughs)
Hmm?

41:00.322 --> 41:02.624
And is this your way
of making up for it?

41:02.692 --> 41:04.427
Yes!
(Giggles)

41:06.131 --> 41:07.532
(Hooves thunder)

41:09.303 --> 41:10.970
Come on, Kit!

41:12.340 --> 41:13.874
<i>Give 'er!</i>

41:13.943 --> 41:15.744
Bring her home!

41:20.119 --> 41:21.353
Tim:
Well, I hate to admit it,

41:21.422 --> 41:24.023
but this does look
a damn sight better

41:24.093 --> 41:26.126
than that barbed wire.

41:26.195 --> 41:28.229
Jack: Hate to admit it,
but I agree with you.

41:28.299 --> 41:30.000
(Laughs)

41:30.069 --> 41:32.471
You agree with me?

41:32.539 --> 41:34.139
Well...

41:34.208 --> 41:35.442
Why don't you
tell me then,

41:35.511 --> 41:37.411
what the deal is
with you and Victor?

41:37.482 --> 41:38.849
What are you going on
about now?

41:38.917 --> 41:42.151
Oh, just tell me, Jack.
Come on.

41:44.625 --> 41:47.093
Marion was my daughter.

41:49.065 --> 41:53.469
She'd already had
her heart broken by one man.

41:54.308 --> 41:57.342
Maybe I was being
over-protective,

41:58.279 --> 42:01.148
but you were
just being a father.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.754
Yeah.

42:03.823 --> 42:08.059
Ten years later,
and you finally understand.

42:14.406 --> 42:15.740
Peter:
You still mad at me?

42:17.411 --> 42:19.012
Lou:
No!

42:19.079 --> 42:20.146
I'm not.

42:22.485 --> 42:23.920
But work is always
gonna come first with you,

42:23.988 --> 42:25.722
isn't it?

42:25.791 --> 42:26.991
What?

42:28.195 --> 42:29.762
Even Paris, it...

42:29.830 --> 42:32.098
It wasn't about us,
it was...

42:32.168 --> 42:33.835
I was an afterthought.

42:33.903 --> 42:36.572
That's absolutely
untrue.

42:37.910 --> 42:42.614
Lou, I asked you to come
to Paris with me because...

42:42.685 --> 42:44.251
(Laughs nervously)

42:45.890 --> 42:47.090
You know, what the hell.

42:47.157 --> 42:50.193
It's not the top
of the Eiffel Tower, but...

42:50.262 --> 42:51.697
It's perfect, actually.

42:51.765 --> 42:53.032
(Laughs nervously)

42:53.101 --> 42:54.969
It's the first place where
you tried to hide me

42:55.038 --> 42:57.039
from your family.

42:59.310 --> 43:01.111
It's the first place
we made hot...

43:01.179 --> 43:04.749
chocolate in front
of the fireplace.

43:06.589 --> 43:08.256
It's perfect.

43:11.396 --> 43:12.463
Peter!

43:13.867 --> 43:15.234
Lou Fleming,

43:16.171 --> 43:17.971
will you marry me?

43:18.041 --> 43:19.407
Oh...
(Astonished laugh)

43:19.475 --> 43:20.809
Are you kidding?

43:20.878 --> 43:22.612
Oh! Look at that ring!

43:22.681 --> 43:23.914
(Laughs)

43:23.983 --> 43:25.183
Um...

43:25.252 --> 43:26.285
Peter!

43:29.726 --> 43:31.027
I'd like an answer, Lou.

43:31.095 --> 43:32.295
I mean, my leg's gonna go
to sleep here, it's...

43:32.364 --> 43:33.730
(Laughs)

43:33.799 --> 43:34.932
Yes!

43:35.000 --> 43:37.401
Yes, I will marry you!

43:38.305 --> 43:44.650
