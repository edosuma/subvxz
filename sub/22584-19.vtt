00:02.680 --> 00:04.591
Previously, on Enterprise:

00:05.080 --> 00:06.479
A parallel universe.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.192
According to some theories...

00:08.320 --> 00:11.471
everything that exists in our universe
should also exist there.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.990
Another Terran Empire?
Another Starfleet?

00:15.120 --> 00:16.439
I'm not a slave.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.676
You're Vulcan. Never forget that.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.800
The things a girl will give up
for her career.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.118
This ship is not only from another
universe, it's from another time.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.117
About 100 years into the future.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.595
Imagine the technology we can find
on that ship.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.392
Ours for the taking.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.958
Enterprise is under attack.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.319
The Tholians can see us.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.668
This is the Captain.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.268
All hands to escape pods.
Abandon ship.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.508
Commander!

00:55.240 --> 00:56.593
You've got thrusters.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.359
-Release the docking clamps.
-I can't.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.879
What about weapons?

01:04.120 --> 01:06.190
This power grid's a mess.
It's gonna take a few minutes.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.914
-Sir, the shields are functional.
-Raise them.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.516
The shields are weakening the clamps,
but they're still holding.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.756
I'll alternate
port and starboard thrusters.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.711
That should shake them loose.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.154
We're free.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.639
Firing aft thrusters.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.955
Six Tholian ships moving towards us.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.833
How much longer for weapons?

01:35.960 --> 01:37.439
The power couplings
have been removed.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.834
I don't know if I can bypass them.

01:38.960 --> 01:39.995
Sir.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.360 --> 03:13.113
-Mr. Tucker.
-Stand by.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.271
I could use some help over here.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.512
When I tell you, shunt the plasma
to the forward emitters.

03:20.640 --> 03:21.789
Three more ships approaching.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.512
Just a few more seconds.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.640
-What was that?
-They've locked on a tractor beam.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.352
We're being pulled back into the dock.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.277
-It's now or never!
-Stand by!

03:35.920 --> 03:36.875
Now!

03:39.240 --> 03:40.992
Tactical systems are online.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.389
Full thrusters.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.590
The remaining ships are retreating.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.038
The station's opened fire.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.037
Does this thing have aft torpedoes?

04:06.160 --> 04:09.357
You better believe it. They're armed.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.430
Escape pods.
Twelve kilometres off the port bow.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.279
They're ours.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.639
Bring them onboard.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.036
We need warp drive.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.116
Engineering's been stripped
to the bulkheads.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.676
But the good news is most of what they
took was still sitting in my hangar deck.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.236
But I need time to figure out
how to put it all back together.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.828
-How much time?
-Two or three days.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.275
Sir, I'm not even sure what some
of these systems are supposed to do.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.709
It's like I'm Chief Engineer
on a steamship...

04:58.840 --> 05:01.229
coming aboard
the first interplanetary transport.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.476
If we don't have warp capability
in 12 hours...

05:03.600 --> 05:05.318
I'm going to find a new Chief Engineer.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.476
I suggest we make use
of the alien workers.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.319
They may know something
about these systems.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.636
Keep them under close surveillance.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.512
Once warp drive is restored...

05:16.640 --> 05:19.279
we'll set a course to rendezvous
with the assault fleet.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.277
We're in no condition for battle.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.152
We made quick work of the Tholians.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.953
This ship was designed to be operated
by a crew of 400.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.911
There are only 47 of us.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.873
The logical course of action
is to take Defiant to Earth...

05:31.000 --> 05:32.672
allow Starfleet to study it...

05:32.800 --> 05:34.870
-reverse-engineer its systems--
-There's no time!

05:35.000 --> 05:36.956
The Empire could lose this war
in a matter of weeks...

05:37.080 --> 05:40.038
if we don't get the Defiant
and its weapons to the frontlines.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.354
Dismissed!

05:44.560 --> 05:45.788
Commander.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.109
Not you.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.989
I should shoot you for betraying me.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.669
The orders giving you command
of Enterprise were obviously fabricated.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.756
It was my duty as a Starfleet officer...

06:11.880 --> 06:14.269
to help Captain Forrest
regain control of his ship.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.436
You swore your loyalty to me.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.950
You should be aware
Captain Forrest ordered me to kill you.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.868
Why are you telling me this?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.195
Forrest is dead.
His orders are no longer valid.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.390
You are my commanding officer.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.991
I never had a problem
with your people...

06:42.000 --> 06:44.673
until they became a part
of this rebellion.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.350
If I had another officer
capable of doing your job...

06:49.480 --> 06:51.869
I'd show you to the nearest airlock.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.996
I need you to get this ship
up and running.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.918
But if I hear so much as a rumour
that you're working behind my back--

06:59.040 --> 07:00.712
-Understood.
-Get out.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.240
What are you wearing?

07:08.240 --> 07:08.274
What are you wearing?

07:08.480 --> 07:11.790
I found it in the Captain's wardrobe.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.873
These people had some strange ideas
about uniforms.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.277
I can't find a mention of it anywhere.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.789
-A mention of what?
-The Empire.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.870
As far as I can tell,
it doesn't exist in the other universe.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.394
No Empire?

07:29.760 --> 07:31.830
A lot of the names are the same...

07:32.520 --> 07:35.273
but their history has been rewritten.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.356
Instead of building an Empire...

07:39.400 --> 07:43.188
Earth became part
of an interspecies alliance.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.915
The United Federation of Planets?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.156
More like a Federation of Fools.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.597
What about us?
Do we exist in this universe?

07:52.760 --> 07:55.991
Computer, access biographical file...

07:56.120 --> 07:58.918
-Starfleet Officer Hoshi Sato.
-Working.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.519
"Hoshi Sato.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.074
"Comm Officer
on Starfleet's first warp 5 ship.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.193
"ln her late 30s...

08:11.320 --> 08:15.029
"she created
the linguacode translation matrix."

08:15.400 --> 08:17.834
At least she was remembered
for something.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.591
I can tell you who she married.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.318
It even says how you die.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.351
Stop. I don't want to know.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.235
-But this isn't you--
-I don't care.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.874
Computer...

08:32.000 --> 08:36.676
display file on Starfleet Officer
Jonathan Archer.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.315
Working.

08:44.760 --> 08:48.639
"Son of famed warp specialist
Henry Archer...

08:48.760 --> 08:50.591
"Jonathan was appointed...

08:50.720 --> 08:54.156
"Captain of Starfleet's first warp 5 ship.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.429
"His name is among
the most recognised in the Federation.

09:02.840 --> 09:06.389
"He earned an impressive list
of commendations during his career.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.069
"Historians called him...

09:09.440 --> 09:12.910
"the greatest explorer
of the 22nd century.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.360
"Two planets were named after him."

09:16.880 --> 09:19.633
-Hey!
-There's nothing great about that man.

09:20.480 --> 09:24.678
He sold out Earth's future
to a group of subhuman species.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.670
Great men are not peacemakers.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.077
Great men are conquerors!

09:31.440 --> 09:32.998
Forget about him.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.272
Your future is just beginning.

09:37.160 --> 09:41.119
Can you imagine the look on the
Emperor's face when he sees this ship?

09:41.600 --> 09:44.672
You'll be declared hero of the Empire.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.636
Starfleet will have to give you
a command of your own.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.198
I already have a command of my own.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.075
What's the problem?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.509
Commander, somebody pulled
both plasma regulators...

10:05.640 --> 10:06.914
out of these housings.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.271
Why are you bothering me with this?
They're probably on the hangar deck.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.868
No, sir, you don't understand.
They were here 10 minutes ago.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.037
I went to get this coupler. When l
came back, the regulators were gone.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.914
You'd better find them because if this
junction's not online in 10 minutes...

10:20.040 --> 10:22.793
I'm gonna tell Archer you're the reason
we don't have warp drive!

10:22.920 --> 10:24.956
Yes. Yes, sir.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.239
Who's in here?

11:08.080 --> 11:11.914
I found traces of reptilian saliva
in the Ensign's wounds.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.233
Something bit him?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.877
The bite radius would suggest
a particularly large reptile...

11:18.000 --> 11:20.070
more than two metres in length.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.395
Can you find this thing
on internal sensors?

11:22.520 --> 11:24.112
It's not in the primary hull.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.470
Sensors are still off-line
on the Engineering decks.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.068
Perhaps it was a pet
owned by one of the original crew.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.954
Unless one of them owned a
velociraptor, I find it extremely unlikely.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.756
There's no sign of the regulators.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.713
Without them,
we can't initialise the reaction chamber.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.398
We're stuck at impulse.

11:40.520 --> 11:44.035
Whoever sabotaged us knew exactly
which components to steal.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.750
The slaves we captured,
bring one of them to the Briefing Room.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.234
Certainly, sir.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.839
What attacked my crewman?

11:58.960 --> 12:03.033
He promised he'd kill us if we told you.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.594
I'll kill you now if you don't.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.591
Please!

12:08.280 --> 12:09.554
Stand aside.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.756
T'Pol to Major Reed. Bring another
prisoner to the Briefing Room.

12:15.880 --> 12:16.869
Acknowledged.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.389
From what I'm told,
the maximum setting...

12:20.080 --> 12:22.992
can actually disintegrate a person.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.915
I've been looking forward to trying it.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.118
His name is Slar.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.475
-Whose name?
-Our slave master.

12:38.840 --> 12:42.355
He was in charge
of the salvage operation.

12:43.040 --> 12:47.556
When you boarded the ship,
he hid in the service crawlways.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.632
He was planning to sabotage the ship.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.432
Where in the crawlways?

12:54.560 --> 12:56.551
Possibly near...

12:57.160 --> 13:00.948
the power transfer conduits on Deck 22.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.749
It's warm there.
His species likes it warm.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.273
What species?

13:09.240 --> 13:11.595
Gorn. He's a Gorn.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.156
We had it cornered in turboshaft 3...

13:22.280 --> 13:25.397
but it appears to have escaped
through this access tube.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.713
That's when we lost contact
with McKenzie and Browne.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.512
They're taking too long.

13:30.640 --> 13:35.236
When my ship was in jeopardy,
I didn't let security handle the situation.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.432
I took care of it myself.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.749
I'd have better luck sending a squad
of Tellarites to capture this thing.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.792
Put an assault team together.
I'll lead it myself.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.829
Sir, I'm picking up a signal
from inside the ship.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.154
I think it's the reptile.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.397
-Can you pinpoint its location?
-The frequency's scrambled.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.033
I want to talk to it.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.357
The translator matrix is tied in.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.870
This is Captain Archer.
Return our plasma regulators now.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.435
I want to leave this ship.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.155
Give me what I want and we'll talk.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.717
No. I'm familiar with your species.
Humans are not trustworthy.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.598
You will give me a shuttlecraft!

14:12.720 --> 14:15.360
Once I'm away from this ship,
I'll tell you where to find the regulators.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.634
Once I'm away from this ship,
I'll tell you where to find the regulators.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.390
This is not a negotiation!
The regulators, now!

14:22.120 --> 14:24.714
If you don't comply, I'll give the order....

14:25.800 --> 14:27.552
He closed the channel.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.515
Major, get the team together.
Your best men.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.431
The Gorn's offer is reasonable.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.551
He has no intention
of returning the regulators.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.635
If we give him a shuttle...

14:39.760 --> 14:41.876
he'll contact his people
and come back with a warship!

14:42.000 --> 14:44.514
Without warp drive,
we'll be an easy target.

14:45.880 --> 14:50.556
Defeat this Gorn and you'll finally
earn the respect you deserve.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.510
There's a bio-sign, very faint...

15:11.680 --> 15:13.796
in access tube 7-alpha, near junction 3.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.876
I'll seal off the bulkhead here.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.196
That'll leave him
with only one escape route.

15:18.320 --> 15:22.029
Flush him out, drive him
into this junction. I'll be waiting for him.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.708
Understood.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.189
-Reed to Captain Archer.
-Go ahead.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.119
It's not here.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.352
He's modified a communicator
to emit a false bio-sign.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.233
-Meet us in Junction 3.
-Acknowledged.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.990
Shut that bloody thing off.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.188
It's a trap!

16:44.600 --> 16:46.272
I've failed you, Captain.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.837
Archer to T'Pol. Where is it?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.830
The Gorn's moved into the primary hull.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.030
It's on Deck 9.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.918
We're going to Plan B.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.908
Access the environmental controls
on that deck.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.600
-Wait for my signal.
-Acknowledged.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.119
Archer to T'Pol.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.994
-Section Four-A, on my mark.
-Standing by.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.795
Now!

18:57.920 --> 18:59.558
Enhancing grav plating.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.110
Grav plating's at 20 Gs.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.793
Give me your weapon.

19:29.520 --> 19:32.956
Defiant Starlog, January 18,2155.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.470
We've recovered the missing
engine components...

19:35.600 --> 19:38.990
and I've ordered a course to rendezvous
with the assault fleet.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.990
What's Major Reed's condition?

19:43.800 --> 19:47.156
At this point, he could go either way.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.518
No doubt there'll be several discreet
celebrations if he should expire.

19:55.560 --> 19:59.235
I notice you've been making
extensive use of the library database.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.920
I was merely researching
classical literature.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.678
I wanted to compare our major works...

20:05.800 --> 20:07.552
with their counterparts
in the other universe.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.478
I skimmed a few
of the more celebrated narratives.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.310
The stories were similar
in some respects...

20:13.440 --> 20:17.069
but their characters
were weak and compassionate.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.953
With the exception of Shakespeare,
of course.

20:20.640 --> 20:24.394
From what I could tell, his plays
were equally grim in both universes.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.276
Examine their historical files.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.593
You may want to learn more
about their Federation.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.710
Did you know in the other universe...

20:34.840 --> 20:37.070
humans and Denobulans
are considered equals...

20:37.200 --> 20:38.553
as are Vulcans.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.910
-You don't find this interesting.
-I find it dangerous.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.317
If I were the Captain,
I'd restrict access to that database.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.796
I'm certain he wouldn't want
to give his crew any ideas.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.991
Perhaps you should
reconsider the repercussions--

20:56.120 --> 20:58.998
This is the Captain.
All hands to battle stations.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.469
Report!

21:11.920 --> 21:15.117
Hull breach on B-Deck.
Emergency bulkheads are engaged.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.196
Concentrate your fire on the Andorians!

21:17.320 --> 21:18.992
Hull plating's at 32%.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.391
Admiral, there's another vessel
approaching.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.794
More rebels?

21:24.800 --> 21:25.789
No.

21:36.720 --> 21:37.948
Direct hits.

21:39.160 --> 21:42.311
The Tellarite ship's opened fire.
No damage.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.798
Lock on their reactor. Fire when ready.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.753
Target destroyed.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.634
-The Vulcan ship's trying to escape.
-Pursuit course.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.714
Captain, they're no threat to us.
I recommend we--

22:01.840 --> 22:03.353
Fire when ready.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.990
The last Andorian ship is retreating.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.756
-Weapons are locked.
-No. Let them go.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.233
I want the other rebels to know
what happened here.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.512
Get me Admiral Black.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.069
Archer?

22:36.720 --> 22:39.314
Sorry we're late for the party, Admiral.

22:40.920 --> 22:44.276
Where's Enterprise?
Is Captain Forrest with you?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.114
It's going to take some time
to explain, sir.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.954
Perhaps you'd like to see
the Defiant for yourself.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.314
A most impressive vessel, Commander.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.074
With the technology on this ship
at our disposal...

23:04.200 --> 23:07.351
-the rebels won't stand a chance.
-Glad you agree, sir.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.471
I intend to recommend
that you get your own command...

23:09.600 --> 23:10.919
at the earliest opportunity.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.234
Respectfully, sir...

23:12.360 --> 23:15.591
you have the authority
to grant a battlefield promotion.

23:17.280 --> 23:20.113
Unfortunately, we don't have a ship
to give you at the moment.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.559
The Defiant.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.673
I'm sure the Fleet Admiral
has other plans for this ship.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.633
They're never going to give you
this ship, you know that.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.274
They'll tear it apart,
try to learn its secrets.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.598
If you're lucky, you'll end up
commanding a moon shuttle.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.115
Don't you see
what the Admiral's planning?

23:39.240 --> 23:42.198
He's going to present this ship
to the Emperor himself.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.311
He'll take all the credit...

23:44.600 --> 23:48.798
-and you'll end up an historical footnote.
-...could alter the course of the war.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.037
The people of the Earth
are in your debt, Commander.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.993
That's Captain.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.477
You're relieved, Admiral.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.515
Our entire assault fleet...

24:16.920 --> 24:19.753
wiped out by a rebel attack.

24:20.080 --> 24:23.117
Thousands of your
fellow Starfleet officers dead.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.717
If the Defiant hadn't arrived when it did,
all of you would be among them.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.918
And who are we to blame for this?

24:31.040 --> 24:34.476
Not the brave men and women
who gave their lives for the Empire.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.876
Criminals who are losing this war...

24:40.000 --> 24:44.073
are sitting in their comfortable offices
back at Starfleet Command.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.868
Their weakness
invited our enemies to strike...

24:47.000 --> 24:48.672
and their corruption and arrogance...

24:48.800 --> 24:51.394
have brought the Empire
to the brink of defeat!

24:54.160 --> 24:56.355
I've been a soldier all my life.

24:57.440 --> 25:01.877
And I will not stand by
and let these people...

25:02.320 --> 25:05.392
destroy an empire
that has endured for centuries!

25:07.720 --> 25:10.359
I ask you, all of you...

25:11.800 --> 25:12.949
to join me.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.674
We cannot put down this rebellion...

25:16.000 --> 25:20.278
so long as our forces are commanded
by dishonourable men.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.752
Before we can defeat the rebels,
we must defeat them.

25:23.880 --> 25:28.237
That ship out there
is the key to our victory.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.588
With the Defiant on our side,
there will be nothing to stop us.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.109
Enter.

25:51.880 --> 25:55.111
It's not wise to make that gesture
even behind closed doors.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.756
It is agreeable to see you again.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.389
Did you review the historical files?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.719
The implications are intriguing.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.554
Intriguing?

26:10.760 --> 26:13.877
This alternate universe
is very different from ours.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.310
I'm not certain a Federation
could ever exist here.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.710
I thought you were an idealist.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.078
-That was many years ago.
-We have to take action!

26:23.200 --> 26:25.714
Archer intends to overthrow Starfleet
and the Emperor.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.673
Archer is right.
The Empire has become corrupt.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.110
A new leader may change things
for the better.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.832
Not for our people.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.995
Weapons on that ship
will annihilate the rebels...

26:36.120 --> 26:38.031
including thousands of Vulcans.

26:38.240 --> 26:41.198
-We can give them an advantage.
-How?

26:42.280 --> 26:45.511
I can download the data on
Defiant's engines and tactical systems.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.834
We'll give it to them.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.396
Data will be of little value.
Archer still controls that ship.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.080
-I'm going to destroy that ship.
-What?

26:52.080 --> 26:53.035
-I'm going to destroy that ship.
-What?

26:53.160 --> 26:56.550
I can disable Defiant's power systems,
but I'll need your help.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.990
Do you want to spend the rest
of your life serving the Empire?

27:02.280 --> 27:05.670
I'm too old to become a revolutionary.

27:06.440 --> 27:10.228
I know Archer. He blames our people
for inciting the rebels.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.830
If he becomes Emperor,
he'll lay waste to Vulcan.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.031
I can't do this without you.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.479
My senior officers
don't think I can do this.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.392
They'll come around.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.956
T'Pol doesn't approve either,
I can see it in her eyes.

27:45.680 --> 27:49.593
Maybe it's time to get rid of her,
now that this ship's operational.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.913
Not just her.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.838
We'll get rid of all the non-Terrans.

28:05.240 --> 28:08.152
-I'll transfer them off Defiant.
-All of them?

28:08.720 --> 28:10.915
The rebels have spies everywhere.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.873
I can't afford to have a single alien
aboard my flagship.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.072
I hope you're not planning on
getting sick anytime soon.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.676
In case you haven't noticed...

28:21.760 --> 28:23.751
your Doctor's an alien.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.030
I've got nothing against Phlox.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.792
His people aren't rebels. It's not...

28:37.720 --> 28:39.199
in their nature.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.314
He can stay.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.677
I've never been
the consort of an Emperor before.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.230
Is there anything I need to know?

28:59.320 --> 29:00.878
I think you've....

29:01.880 --> 29:04.235
I think you've got the basics down.

29:28.680 --> 29:31.274
Put me through
to Fleet Admiral Gardner.

29:32.760 --> 29:37.038
Corporal, escort Commander T'Pol
to Transporter Room 2.

29:51.560 --> 29:55.269
Your service aboard this ship
is no longer required.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.911
Archer, what the hell is going on?

30:01.040 --> 30:02.712
I take it you received my message.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.400
You demanded Starfleet's
unconditional surrender!

30:05.520 --> 30:07.192
Have you lost your mind?

30:07.320 --> 30:11.472
You've seen the specs on the Defiant.
You know what its weapons can do.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.990
I want to speak with Admiral Black.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.071
He's not available right now.

30:19.760 --> 30:23.673
I suggest you order your forces
to stand down.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.839
Starfleet can't afford to lose
any more ships.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.355
This is your only warning, Commander.

30:30.840 --> 30:34.628
Do not approach Earth
or you will be fired upon!

30:39.680 --> 30:41.477
Bridge to Doctor Phlox.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.435
This is Phlox.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.232
There's a medical emergency
on the Avenger.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.511
-You're needed immediately.
-Acknowledged.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.789
Neither of you appears to be injured.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.196
Sabotage the Defiant?
Have you lost your senses?

31:06.320 --> 31:08.117
You're the only non-T erran
on the Defiant.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.037
Any of us would arouse suspicion.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.958
You heard Archer's speech.
He's delusional.

31:13.160 --> 31:16.038
It's not a delusion if the Captain
has the power to do what he says.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.355
And from what I've seen,
he most certainly does.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.913
I should report you both.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.918
-Are you loyal to the Empire or not?
-Of course I am!

31:23.040 --> 31:26.396
Archer plans to kill the Emperor
and take his place.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.758
Captain has proven himself in battle.
Perhaps he should rule the Empire.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.395
If Archer fails, his crew
will have to answer for his crimes.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.878
We'll be executed.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.917
There's an old tradition.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.679
If someone saves the Emperor's life...

31:46.320 --> 31:49.232
it's said there's no request
he can refuse him.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.632
Consider the possibilities.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.230
A medical facility of your own
with unlimited resources.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.473
You could conduct experiments
as you see fit.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.677
Don't forget the females.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.075
Females?

32:04.200 --> 32:07.397
You'll be able to choose
as many concubines as you'd like.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.479
If the Emperor were my patient,
I'd be obligated to save his life.

32:15.880 --> 32:20.032
I suppose what you're suggesting
isn't that different.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.436
-What's this?
-Save it, Commander.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.949
The schematics you downloaded,
where are they?

32:39.080 --> 32:40.354
Schematics?

32:46.320 --> 32:47.514
Let's go.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.311
I was hoping you'd put up a fight.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.360
I'm surprised you're not exhausted from
all the beds you've jumped into recently.

33:05.360 --> 33:05.678
I'm surprised you're not exhausted from
all the beds you've jumped into recently.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.268
Commander Tucker told me I should
give you a few pointers in that area.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.188
Bring her.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.077
Shut down the Turbolifts.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.838
Secure the Bridge.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.792
Who are you working with?

33:59.080 --> 34:01.150
I hope you're prepared to die.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.396
My death will change nothing.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.592
You will not prevail.

34:08.840 --> 34:12.116
The Defiant will prevail.
It's simply a matter of firepower.

34:12.239 --> 34:14.036
The Federation is our future.

34:14.159 --> 34:17.072
You're mistaking our universe
for someone else's.

34:18.199 --> 34:22.079
It may take centuries,
but humanity will pay for its arrogance.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.992
-These interruptions aren't helping.
-I need an estimate.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.268
The inside of this panel...

34:41.400 --> 34:43.469
doesn't look anything
like the schematic you gave me.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.434
You need to remove the duotronic
module. The relays are behind it.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.079
I've removed the module.

34:54.199 --> 34:56.668
You have to disengage
the flow regulators...

34:56.800 --> 34:58.358
before you remove the relays...

34:58.480 --> 35:00.357
or the plasma will ignite.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.316
Someone's trying to override
the Bridge lockouts.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.800
Doctor, you must hurry.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.038
Doctor, you must hurry.

35:15.040 --> 35:18.191
-The warp field's fluctuating.
-It's a power drain.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.757
Primary EPS relays.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.632
-I'll alert the Captain.
-No.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.759
Probably just a micro-fracture
in the conduit.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.312
Do you really want to
interrupt the Captain for that?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.912
-I'll handle it. Take over.
-Yes, sir.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.395
Take a team aboard Avenger.
Confine every alien on that ship.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.637
There is no point in continuing.
She's not going to talk.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.958
We should kill her.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.469
You've been looking forward to that
for a while, haven't you?

35:59.200 --> 36:00.633
Archer to the Bridge! Report!

36:00.760 --> 36:03.479
Main power's off-line.
We've dropped out of warp.

36:04.040 --> 36:05.792
Close to 10,000 metres.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.037
T arget their primary hull.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.151
Phlox to Soval, I'm finished here.
Stand by to transport--

36:23.920 --> 36:25.797
What the hell have you done?

36:34.760 --> 36:37.399
-I need weapons!
-Everything's off-line.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.708
Continue firing.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.436
Primary systems are coming back.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.118
-We have shields.
-Raise them.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.675
Soval to Phlox.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.758
Their power grid's being restored.
What's happening?

37:10.240 --> 37:12.879
Doctor? Respond!

37:13.080 --> 37:15.913
-Weapons are online.
-Destroy them!

37:24.120 --> 37:26.395
Get us out of their weapons' range!

37:27.800 --> 37:29.791
Divert all power to hull plating.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.796
-They've taken heavy damage.
-They're trying to escape.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.353
Photon torpedoes.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.917
Lock on to their reactor.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.478
Before I forget...

38:02.720 --> 38:07.430
first thing tomorrow, I want you
to erase the historical database.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.470
I don't want anyone else
getting any ideas...

38:11.600 --> 38:15.195
about this Federation of Planets.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.638
We'll lose all the data
on our counterparts.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.829
Exactly.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.311
It'll only take a day for the fleet
to return to Earth.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.510
Do you think
the commanders will support you?

38:32.640 --> 38:37.191
They're loyal to the Emperor.
They don't really care who it is.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.436
By the time the fleet arrives...

38:42.840 --> 38:45.912
the reign of Emperor...

38:46.680 --> 38:49.478
Jonathan Archer
will have already begun.

38:55.520 --> 38:57.988
Once we've put down the rebellion....

38:58.520 --> 39:02.308
I'll expand the Empire throughout....

39:10.120 --> 39:11.678
Are you all right?

39:44.840 --> 39:46.910
Open a channel
to Fleet Admiral Gardner.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.189
Channel open.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.392
This is the Starship Defiant.

39:50.520 --> 39:54.832
If you don't surrender immediately, we'll
begin targeting your cities. Respond.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.750
Where's Archer? Who the hell are you?

39:59.280 --> 40:02.113
You're speaking with Empress Sato.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.315
Prepare to receive instructions.

40:06.305 --> 40:12.762
