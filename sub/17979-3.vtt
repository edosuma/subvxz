01:00.200 --> 01:02.684
I had a dream
about Jenny's movie last night.

01:02.719 --> 01:04.947
- It was weird.
- What was it?

01:04.983 --> 01:07.721
Me, you and Helena?
We're like Charlie's angels.

01:07.756 --> 01:09.258
Who is Charlie?

01:09.293 --> 01:11.255
Once upon a time,

01:11.290 --> 01:15.814
there were three little lesbians
who just hung out at a coffee shop.

01:15.849 --> 01:17.913
But I changed all that.

01:17.948 --> 01:20.015
And now they work for me.

01:21.220 --> 01:23.400
My name is Bev.

01:24.172 --> 01:25.856
Good morning, lesbians.

01:27.718 --> 01:30.693
- Good morning, Bev.
- Ladies.

01:30.728 --> 01:32.440
I have a new mission for you.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.903
It involves going under cover.

01:34.946 --> 01:37.270
Okay, lesbians,
what do you think?

01:38.064 --> 01:40.059
Sure sounds dangerous.

01:40.102 --> 01:42.598
Are you sure it's not gonna ruin our hair?

01:42.642 --> 01:46.727
I promise you girls. I won't let anything
happen to your hair or makeup.

01:49.104 --> 01:51.467
- Helen?
- Count me in.

01:51.504 --> 01:54.237
- Bev...
- Well of course, we're in.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.240
But are you sure these gaydar guns
are really gonna work?

01:58.263 --> 02:01.647
Well, they'd better work
because our target just entered the room.

02:14.675 --> 02:16.879
Okay, lesbians, go get her.

02:17.334 --> 02:19.429
Come on, girls.
Let's get her.

04:30.728 --> 04:32.671
- "Beatrocker" by Mad Professor -

04:41.646 --> 04:43.401
Stay thrilled,
she's still gone strong.

04:43.415 --> 04:44.781
Oh, morning lazy asses.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.521
Fuck off you freak.

04:46.558 --> 04:47.930
How's it going, Shane?

04:47.977 --> 04:49.882
... since 5:30 A.M.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.131
I gotta say it's going pretty well.

04:52.136 --> 04:54.351
And all of this is because
you sworn off sex?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.893
Yep. And all the crap
that goes along with it.

04:56.925 --> 04:58.800
- Yeah, sister.
- Owe me.

04:59.378 --> 05:01.012
I have declared

05:01.047 --> 05:02.312
a moratorium

05:02.746 --> 05:04.322
on one sex.

05:04.726 --> 05:06.420
A moratorium

05:06.536 --> 05:08.052
on drama,

05:08.097 --> 05:10.230
and a moratorium on jealousy.

05:10.326 --> 05:12.512
And a moratorium on girls
throwing rocks through your windows

05:12.555 --> 05:14.662
- or burning your shit down.
- Yep.

05:14.695 --> 05:16.651
What? Someone threw a rock
through your window?

05:16.695 --> 05:18.782
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was
one of the bridesmaids from the wedding.

05:18.826 --> 05:20.410
No, I'm telling you.
I'm fucking done.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.673
A few days ago, I've decided
to take a major break from sex.

05:22.708 --> 05:25.973
Thereby eliminating the main cause
of insanity in my life.

05:26.797 --> 05:28.312
And I gotta tell you, girls.

05:28.969 --> 05:30.314
I have never,

05:30.357 --> 05:33.461
ever felt so freakishly clear-headed

05:34.748 --> 05:38.204
- or highly energized.
- Speaking of freakish,

05:38.248 --> 05:40.001
- look at Jenny's new assistant.
- Hi!

05:41.827 --> 05:44.443
Well, you kinda have to admire her
a little bit.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.531
It's gross.
There is something wrong with that girl.

05:54.156 --> 05:56.641
So, Denise seems nice.

05:56.676 --> 05:58.541
You know, mortgage brokers
make a lot of money.

05:58.636 --> 06:00.384
We didn't have anything in common.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.493
And I know, you're gonna say
I'm a snob

06:02.507 --> 06:04.231
- but I...
- Tina, honey, you are a snob.

06:04.268 --> 06:06.304
I mean, come on! We love you!
But you're a snob.

06:06.806 --> 06:08.633
Alright. We'll find someone
more your style,

06:08.698 --> 06:10.703
someone like, I don't know,
in the biz or...

06:10.736 --> 06:14.212
No, no, no. I don't wanna go out
with someone in the movie business.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.031
Tina. Picky, picky, picky.
Really.

06:18.206 --> 06:20.562
Okay, we'll find you someone
in the art world,

06:20.608 --> 06:23.202
- or art-adjacent.
- That's important to you,

06:23.249 --> 06:25.364
am I right? It is.

06:25.398 --> 06:27.323
You know what we should do?
We should go on OurChart

06:27.358 --> 06:29.243
looking at some members' profiles.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.384
Tina, don't look at me like that!

06:31.709 --> 06:32.923
I'm trying to help you.

06:35.379 --> 06:37.473
Jesus Christ!

06:53.140 --> 06:55.474
Oh my god!
I think I'm gonna vomit.

06:56.057 --> 06:57.793
Damnit! He's so

06:57.828 --> 06:59.592
fucking cute!

07:00.150 --> 07:01.803
You see that guy over there?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.532
Jodi's interpretor?

07:04.649 --> 07:06.874
He hit on me the other day
in the mensroom.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.054
- He's handsome.
- So?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.964
Are you attracted to him?

07:13.998 --> 07:15.933
No, of course not.

07:16.008 --> 07:18.004
It wouldn't be such an outlandish thing.

07:18.047 --> 07:21.146
- The last trans guy I dated...
- Look, I'm not into men.

07:21.149 --> 07:25.744
The last trans guy I dated wasn't
into men at all before he transitioned.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.516
She was a gold-star butch lesbian.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.154
I'm not a gold star, either.

07:29.188 --> 07:30.353
Julie was.

07:30.391 --> 07:32.565
Until she became Jake.

07:32.580 --> 07:35.006
Jake turned out to be a gay man.

07:41.109 --> 07:44.786
I heard this theory that
what's genetically encoded in us

07:44.828 --> 07:48.165
isn't attraction to men
or attraction to women, but

07:48.200 --> 07:50.484
it's same-sex attraction.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.276
There you go.

08:01.559 --> 08:04.656
Adele, do away with these sweaty things.
Thanks.

08:14.831 --> 08:17.396
Wow, you have great abs.
Can I...?

08:17.438 --> 08:20.464
No, no, don't, don't, don't,
just don't touch me today, please.

08:20.511 --> 08:23.195
- She's not gonna make it.
- I don't think she's gonna make it.

08:28.699 --> 08:31.046
Where did I put my keys?

08:31.091 --> 08:32.715
In your bag.

08:35.671 --> 08:37.544
Hey look, the Pink Ride.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.496
Oh, I'm doing it.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.434
- I'm training for it.
- You are?

08:41.509 --> 08:43.116
- Yes.
- Maybe we should all do it.

08:43.152 --> 08:46.844
- You do what?
- It's called the Subaru Pink Ride and

08:46.870 --> 08:49.066
it's for breast cancer research.

08:49.140 --> 08:51.594
I'm gonna do it.
I think it'll be great.

08:51.639 --> 08:54.057
We should get a little team together.

08:55.190 --> 08:57.515
- We could be Team Dana.
- I love it.

08:57.551 --> 08:59.804
- I love that. Team Dana...
- Right?

08:59.850 --> 09:01.677
Yeah, and we can get Kit and Bette
to do it with us.

09:01.722 --> 09:04.237
- We should ask Jodi as well.
- And Jodi.

09:04.279 --> 09:07.055
- Yeah, but Jodi didn't know Dana.
- Yeah, but,

09:07.510 --> 09:09.645
she has breasts, right?

09:09.691 --> 09:11.076
Good point.

09:11.110 --> 09:15.197
You guys, you have to train for this.
It's so hard.

09:15.241 --> 09:17.254
If you don't you're not gonna finish it.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.616
What don't we get Tasha to train us?
'Cause, I mean, she knows how to train.

09:22.652 --> 09:23.916
Obviously.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.416
I thought you said

09:25.461 --> 09:28.837
Tasha was going to Iraq. I thought
you said her unit was delayed.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.436
Yeah, no. They're just delayed.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.436
I guess her equipment didn't come in
or something.

09:34.501 --> 09:36.577
I don't know.
It must happen all the time.

09:36.612 --> 09:37.896
Ready?

09:38.333 --> 09:39.785
Let's go.

09:40.853 --> 09:42.886
- "Games" by Carla Thomas -

09:57.652 --> 10:00.728
Thank you, ladies.
Nice doing business with you.

10:32.712 --> 10:34.459
Everybody's paid up.

10:35.704 --> 10:37.048
Feeling good?

10:38.742 --> 10:39.976
Very good.

10:47.482 --> 10:49.388
- "Between You And Me"
by Shirley Brown -

10:51.694 --> 10:52.887
See you later.

10:57.701 --> 11:00.538
I think I might have to bag
on Big Bear this weekend.

11:00.573 --> 11:03.308
- Oh, no, you don't.
- I'm really sorry.

11:03.351 --> 11:04.727
I know it's fucked up.

11:04.754 --> 11:06.969
I have a reception for David Hockney

11:07.001 --> 11:08.707
at the Hammer on saturday.

11:08.754 --> 11:10.439
- So?!
- Uh, so,

11:10.474 --> 11:13.426
several of my major donors
are gonna be there.

11:16.165 --> 11:17.509
What?

11:18.163 --> 11:20.868
We've been doing this for 11 years,

11:20.915 --> 11:22.918
and this was the first time

11:22.952 --> 11:24.619
I was ever gonna bring anyone.

11:27.665 --> 11:28.587
Really?

11:30.549 --> 11:32.293
Fuck David Hockney.

11:38.908 --> 11:40.320
I gotta run.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.583
You, you watch yourself.
Don't get too personal.

11:44.626 --> 11:46.529
Oh please, me? What?

11:46.573 --> 11:49.529
I'm so excited we're dealing this thing.
Thank you so much.

11:50.215 --> 11:51.947
What "Fuck David Hockney"?

11:54.704 --> 11:56.880
She was trying to get out of going

11:56.914 --> 11:59.489
to Big Bear this weekend
to meet a bunch of my old friends.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.349
- Really?
- And you didn't let her get away with it?

12:01.392 --> 12:04.377
- Good for you.
- She made a commitment.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.268
Hey, Alice, we're gonna set up over here.

12:07.302 --> 12:09.500
Shane and I just wanna show you
a couple of profiles

12:09.545 --> 12:11.368
of girls that we think
you should date.

12:11.412 --> 12:14.019
Tina! There's nothing wrong
with meeting someone on the internet.

12:14.052 --> 12:16.511
- Nothing. Come on!
- It's weird. It's weird.

12:16.515 --> 12:18.920
T., you've gotta look at it this way.
It's less random than a blind date,

12:19.164 --> 12:20.340
and you can find
all about the girl

12:20.346 --> 12:21.698
before you waste your time
having lunch with her.

12:21.736 --> 12:24.390
It's a really good point.
Hey, the hair. Start the hair.

12:25.584 --> 12:27.921
That makes total sense, Jodi said.
Do you mind if I join you?

12:27.965 --> 12:29.358
Oh my god! Get over here.

12:29.405 --> 12:33.361
Okay. So, I'll first limit it to the,
you know, people that live in L.A.,

12:33.405 --> 12:35.671
and then I will add
potential art people.

12:35.716 --> 12:38.400
How can we... the picture?

12:38.445 --> 12:40.511
Oh, by the way,

12:40.546 --> 12:43.591
somebody answers a question
on their profile. Like,

12:43.626 --> 12:46.128
favorite book, "Captain Corelli's Mandolin".

12:46.176 --> 12:48.131
It's good, promising.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.580
Nancy Drew, not so much.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.951
- I love Nancy Drew.
- Me too!

12:52.985 --> 12:54.881
Really? OK. All right, Nancy Drew.

12:54.925 --> 12:56.658
I mean, she is a lesbian icon.

12:58.656 --> 13:00.611
That's a pretty slick-looking camera
you've got there.

13:00.656 --> 13:03.358
Yeah, it's a Panasonic TVX100.

13:03.395 --> 13:05.399
It's amazing, actually.

13:05.435 --> 13:07.410
You're gonna hook it up
to the computer?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.468
We're recording of a fireware.

13:09.505 --> 13:13.072
Yeah. It makes it possible for us
to record on to the computer's hard drive

13:13.106 --> 13:16.012
at the same time as we're recording on
to the video camera.

13:18.196 --> 13:21.371
I don't have the fucking slightest idea
what you're talking about, but...

13:21.406 --> 13:22.969
sounds awesome.

13:25.616 --> 13:27.789
How are you going to do her hair?

13:27.836 --> 13:31.639
I don't know yet. Maybe something
a little classy or sassy. I don't know.

13:31.675 --> 13:33.119
Maybe do you?

13:33.167 --> 13:34.819
Oh! Go back, go back! Her!

13:34.856 --> 13:36.919
What about her? She's good.

13:37.666 --> 13:39.450
No, keep browsing.

13:39.496 --> 13:41.812
What? Why? She's totally cute.

13:41.834 --> 13:44.020
Yeah, I know she's cute.
But she's a little

13:44.054 --> 13:45.942
crazy in bed,
if you know what I mean.

13:46.444 --> 13:48.359
How do you know?

13:51.967 --> 13:53.650
- Next.
- Roll.

13:56.195 --> 13:57.072
Come!

14:04.255 --> 14:06.500
I just got this from my C.O.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.981
It's a chapter 15 discharge.

14:19.027 --> 14:20.293
I know.

14:20.328 --> 14:22.291
The command is recommending
a discharge

14:22.308 --> 14:26.061
from the United States army reserve
for homosexual conduct.

14:26.096 --> 14:27.691
I know you didn't want my case.

14:27.747 --> 14:29.910
Oh, I've been detailed.
Your case is right here.

14:29.945 --> 14:31.593
So now, I don't have a choice.

14:32.436 --> 14:35.761
Unless you decide to hire
a civilian attorney.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.573
I would like for you to represent me.

14:40.216 --> 14:42.553
Can we go over grounds for separation?

14:47.175 --> 14:48.623
First allegation:

14:49.568 --> 14:52.560
On march 2007, you were seen
at the...

14:52.596 --> 14:55.100
with a group of women
who are openly lesbian.

14:55.146 --> 14:57.910
One of the women had her arm
around your shoulder.

15:00.435 --> 15:02.381
Second allegation:

15:02.848 --> 15:07.132
on march 2007, you were again seen
just outside the... base

15:07.165 --> 15:09.571
with the same woman
having what appeared to be

15:09.605 --> 15:12.023
- a lovers' quarrel.
- That's presumption.

15:12.066 --> 15:14.861
Even if I had been seen,
Brown made that charge

15:14.947 --> 15:17.303
and I personnaly know
he has a grudge against me.

15:18.049 --> 15:20.123
Well, the first allegation was made
by a primary accuser.

15:20.137 --> 15:22.084
Her name is not list in this document.

15:22.118 --> 15:23.913
But the second incident

15:23.958 --> 15:26.532
was backed up
by your commanding officer, Major

15:26.567 --> 15:29.813
Kevin Dickson,
who's also witness to the event.

15:31.518 --> 15:32.913
Go on.

15:32.958 --> 15:35.041
There's an other allegation.

15:35.088 --> 15:38.861
Let just hear that you showed
a female soldier in your unit,

15:38.906 --> 15:40.932
Anita Martinez,

15:40.977 --> 15:43.473
preferential treatment
for job reclass vacation

15:43.517 --> 15:45.202
because you were romantically
involved with her.

15:45.246 --> 15:47.241
- That's total bullshit.
- Please, don't use... language,

15:47.279 --> 15:50.022
- would you mind, Officer Williams?
- It's a flat out lie.

15:50.056 --> 15:51.484
Well, these are the allegations.

15:51.528 --> 15:52.693
And they didn't come out of the blue.

15:52.706 --> 15:54.432
There are some solid evidence
you're backing them up.

15:54.456 --> 15:55.933
And if it's not true,

15:55.976 --> 15:57.533
then it's on you to prove it.

15:58.088 --> 16:00.581
And like it or not,
that's the way this thing works.

16:01.236 --> 16:02.903
- "It Ain't Always What You Do"
by The Soul Children -

16:03.349 --> 16:05.092
So, form expression.

16:05.129 --> 16:07.151
I didn't know how to ask this delicately,

16:07.187 --> 16:08.814
but I'm dying.

16:08.858 --> 16:12.295
Delicately? What?
I thought we were talking about sex.

16:12.770 --> 16:15.202
Yeah. But, I wanna know...

16:15.240 --> 16:18.065
Well, some people like delicate sex.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.734
Not me. There's nothing worse than

16:24.159 --> 16:27.384
- tentative, timid lesbian sex.
- Right.

16:28.229 --> 16:33.235
I would never be in one of
those lesbian-bed-death relationships,

16:33.280 --> 16:34.674
where you just

16:34.708 --> 16:37.874
cuddle and, you know,
say good night and go to sleep.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.502
I have a teddy bear if I want to do that.

16:40.537 --> 16:42.562
- Yes!
- Uh, I was watching.

16:42.590 --> 16:44.805
Was that lesbian? Is that lesbian?

16:45.750 --> 16:47.142
Lesbian?

16:47.647 --> 16:49.793
Oh, lesbian. That?

16:49.860 --> 16:52.292
That is not sexy.
That's not sexy.

16:52.339 --> 16:53.505
That?

16:54.239 --> 16:56.392
- Is that more sexy?
- That is better.

16:56.430 --> 16:58.024
- Alright.
- Much sexier.

16:58.068 --> 17:00.615
How do you say cunnilungus?

17:00.657 --> 17:03.824
I made one up.
Is that cunninlingus?

17:04.446 --> 17:06.791
- I would be good.
- Pretty good. Pretty close.

17:06.827 --> 17:10.042
Well, my guess is just say
"Lick my pussy".

17:10.078 --> 17:11.915
You could say that, couldn't you?

17:13.210 --> 17:14.346
I'll remember that.

17:14.378 --> 17:16.223
No, you sworn off sex, remember?

17:16.928 --> 17:20.204
Yeah, yes, yes, I did, I did, I did.
I have a question.

17:20.588 --> 17:22.022
How do you say fuck?

17:22.070 --> 17:25.366
- Fuck you know, fuck you, obviously.
- Oh, not fuck. Fuck, you know.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.786
This is, you know, to actually fuck,

17:27.820 --> 17:30.033
you do that if you wanna say
"Fuck me, baby".

17:34.210 --> 17:37.184
Who says that to who? Bette says that to you,
or you say that to Bette?

17:38.619 --> 17:40.575
Bette said "Don't get too personal".

17:40.610 --> 17:43.366
Oh, Bette. Boring, boring Bette.
I'll cut it out.

17:43.401 --> 17:44.764
We'll cut it out.

17:44.799 --> 17:46.514
Last night, she said it to me.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.485
Okay, alright.
La, la, la, la.

17:48.559 --> 17:52.745
I don't wanna hear what you and my sister
have been doing. I don't mind. No!

17:54.698 --> 17:57.213
Private Jack Brown's wife
just had a baby.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.944
And he wanted to be reclassified
MOS42A

17:59.979 --> 18:01.353
so he could be home with them.

18:01.398 --> 18:03.656
But Brown's lazy soldier.

18:03.690 --> 18:06.667
He had a sub-standard score
in aptitude area CL

18:06.702 --> 18:10.067
and he's not qualified
to be a human resources specialist.

18:10.110 --> 18:13.276
Specialist Martinez had two commendations

18:13.321 --> 18:16.344
scored in the top
1% in that aptitude area

18:16.382 --> 18:18.647
and it's discipline and hard working.

18:18.679 --> 18:20.156
And I never touched her.

18:20.211 --> 18:22.067
Except to comfort her
over being upset

18:22.102 --> 18:23.844
about having to leave her little boy

18:23.881 --> 18:26.534
after we learnt that
her unit was getting redeployed.

18:27.219 --> 18:28.957
When you comforted her,
did you hug her?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.737
Is that grounds for separation?

18:30.772 --> 18:32.495
Probably wouldn't be
if you hadn't been seen holding hands

18:32.532 --> 18:34.244
with some girl at the racetrack.

18:34.839 --> 18:36.574
I wanna stay in the service.

18:36.610 --> 18:39.134
Should have thought of that
before you decided to be a lesbian.

18:39.171 --> 18:41.084
You know what?
I'm gonna take that back.

18:41.130 --> 18:43.034
I'm gonna assume you are not a lesbian

18:43.079 --> 18:44.704
because that's exactly
what we're gonna have to prove

18:44.710 --> 18:46.226
if you wanna win this thing.

18:47.332 --> 18:49.406
Let me clearify to you, Beech.

18:50.231 --> 18:51.787
I never decided

18:51.820 --> 18:53.615
to become a lesbian.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.675
But I decided to join the service.

18:57.079 --> 19:00.495
I graduated second
in my ROTC class,

19:00.529 --> 19:03.167
I have a bronze star
with V for valor

19:03.202 --> 19:06.416
for saving the lives of three american
and two iraqi soldiers

19:06.482 --> 19:08.986
after an IED attack in Tal Afar.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.658
I watched my staff sergeant,
Robert Ganz,

19:11.660 --> 19:14.508
get his stomach blown open
after a mortar attack

19:14.603 --> 19:17.158
and held him in my arms
as he died.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.875
Which, by the way, was not
a romantic embrace either.

19:21.881 --> 19:24.005
I believe in american democraty

19:24.053 --> 19:27.096
and I'm willing to risk my life
for my country.

19:27.742 --> 19:30.706
Do you really think
I don't belong in this army?

19:39.650 --> 19:40.708
Alright.

19:43.210 --> 19:45.916
Here's what I'm open for, Williams.

19:47.680 --> 19:51.588
I'm open that girl in the parking lot
turns out to be your first cousin.

19:52.131 --> 19:54.287
And that the two of you
were having a heated argument

19:54.290 --> 19:57.156
about whether to put your old grandma
on a nursing home.

19:59.161 --> 20:01.255
That's what happened here, right?

20:22.641 --> 20:25.569
- Oh, look at that. She's from Slovakia.
- ... down a bit.

20:25.952 --> 20:28.408
Hey, Alice, can I talk to you
for a second?

20:28.454 --> 20:30.687
Oh no. Not right now. Sorry.

20:30.722 --> 20:32.559
I made a podcast.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.968
What do you mean you made a podcast?

20:36.004 --> 20:37.737
Yeah, I was hoping you could
take a look at it.

20:37.802 --> 20:40.116
- You know, see if we could...
- And I've got to get this.

20:42.613 --> 20:43.987
Hey! How did it go?

20:57.731 --> 20:58.987
Stop working.

21:00.524 --> 21:01.637
Sorry.

21:02.353 --> 21:03.430
So...

21:04.302 --> 21:07.127
do you want to know more
about who's gonna be there?

21:07.165 --> 21:09.260
Yeah. I know there is

21:09.302 --> 21:10.480
Frank.

21:10.524 --> 21:12.037
And

21:12.084 --> 21:13.797
- what's his wife's name?
- Sammy.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.157
Oh, and what about, um...

21:25.444 --> 21:26.887
- Michelangelo.
- Michelangelo.

21:26.905 --> 21:28.420
Oh, god! How could I forget that?

21:30.662 --> 21:32.197
So, tell me about him.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.628
Stop!

21:49.032 --> 21:50.778
But he's... Oh! He's a curator!

21:55.574 --> 21:57.739
Don't make me out to be such a snob.

21:57.814 --> 21:59.439
- Oh, you're a snob.
- No, I'm not.

21:59.482 --> 22:00.619
Oh, yeah.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.539
I'm nervous.

22:16.694 --> 22:18.131
Oh god!

22:22.544 --> 22:23.698
Both hands.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.788
So what happened?

22:51.093 --> 22:52.481
Fuck!

22:52.524 --> 22:55.068
God! They're fuckers!

22:55.106 --> 22:57.939
Beech got detailed
to be my defense.

22:57.976 --> 22:59.621
The homophobic prick?

22:59.695 --> 23:01.690
Yeah, he doesn't want it.
He has to take it.

23:01.725 --> 23:03.219
He has no choice.

23:08.225 --> 23:10.111
I don't see my name here.

23:10.646 --> 23:13.332
Believe me, Alice.
They know who you are.

23:13.947 --> 23:16.339
Right. They're the military.

23:16.377 --> 23:18.380
Well, they don't know
who they're dealing with.

23:18.414 --> 23:20.031
- Alice...
- I mean...

23:26.744 --> 23:29.249
That last one is false by the way.
The one

23:29.284 --> 23:31.010
about Martinez.

23:31.674 --> 23:33.532
Yeah, I know that.

23:35.605 --> 23:36.780
You know what?

23:38.155 --> 23:39.952
We'll fight it. I mean,

23:40.685 --> 23:42.709
we're not gotta back down to that.

23:43.435 --> 23:45.470
What do we have to do
to win this thing?

23:46.235 --> 23:48.149
I have to lie.

23:48.195 --> 23:50.961
Isn't that against
your military code of honor?

23:54.636 --> 23:56.279
What do I have to do?

23:56.797 --> 23:59.970
Do you need me to disappear for a while?
Do you need me to leave you alone?

24:07.178 --> 24:08.872
That's not what I want.

24:09.438 --> 24:11.371
Because I can do that.

24:11.405 --> 24:13.872
I know it's late in the game,
but I can do that.

24:14.147 --> 24:17.022
I can be really on the D.L., you know?
Like,

24:17.066 --> 24:19.143
just be really discreet,

24:20.028 --> 24:22.470
like a nonexistent girlfriend.

24:22.507 --> 24:24.682
I want you to know I can do that.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.632
Sorry, we shouldn't have stopped
to eat.

25:06.158 --> 25:07.244
So,

25:07.789 --> 25:09.952
there's Huahine,

25:09.999 --> 25:11.633
Haiatea,

25:13.016 --> 25:14.511
Bora-Bora and

25:14.536 --> 25:16.701
Wapiti.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.822
So silent islands.

25:30.068 --> 25:32.294
Tahaha.

25:33.689 --> 25:37.184
Flower shaped islands
and smell all vanilla.

25:37.228 --> 25:38.722
And you have a place there?

25:38.769 --> 25:40.584
A tiny little piece of paradise.

25:40.617 --> 25:42.261
It belonged to my grandfather.

25:44.737 --> 25:47.674
- If I ever get out of here...
- You will.

25:48.298 --> 25:49.751
You'll get out.

25:56.229 --> 25:58.454
Peabody, you've got a visitor.

25:59.869 --> 26:01.783
It's ten o'clock at night.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.354
I guess somebody's pulled some strings.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.373
You've got friends in high places.

26:21.350 --> 26:23.065
Be right back.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.144
Yeah, right.

26:31.178 --> 26:32.283
Take this.

27:03.190 --> 27:05.054
Woo. Let me eat your pussy.

27:10.458 --> 27:12.704
Were I receptive to such a proposition,

27:12.749 --> 27:15.416
it would first require a full booty check.

27:15.449 --> 27:17.396
And were you to pass muster,

27:17.441 --> 27:19.773
baby, I'd give it to you family style.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.415
Don't worry, darling.
Mummy's here.

27:32.449 --> 27:33.823
Where the hell have you been?

27:33.868 --> 27:36.724
I've been on a treasure hunt.

27:36.758 --> 27:39.964
It was mad. I mean,
we ended up exhausted

27:40.000 --> 27:42.045
on some... little greek island.

27:42.090 --> 27:45.426
I know, I never go on these things,
but in this case,

27:46.750 --> 27:48.926
the winner got to walk away

27:48.970 --> 27:51.495
with this magnificent fragment

27:51.991 --> 27:54.624
of a praxitelis foot quite genuine,

27:54.659 --> 27:55.944
I'm sure.

27:55.981 --> 27:58.894
So breathtakingly beautiful.

27:58.930 --> 28:00.865
So priceless.

28:01.401 --> 28:02.847
So illegal.

28:03.259 --> 28:05.495
- Sort of like you, darling.
- Mummy,

28:05.541 --> 28:07.655
I don't have much time for this.

28:07.700 --> 28:09.434
Really?

28:10.751 --> 28:13.934
Seems to me you've got
great gobs of time, Helena.

28:14.611 --> 28:17.506
Yes, let's not bother with the small talk.

28:18.120 --> 28:21.066
Shall we just finally say
that you've learnt your lesson?

28:21.922 --> 28:24.075
I've learnt a phenomenal amount, mummy.

28:24.111 --> 28:26.146
I've learnt
that I could look after myself.

28:26.191 --> 28:28.806
- And that I don't...
- That's wonderful, sweetheart. Now,

28:28.842 --> 28:31.624
Will is on his way to post your bail.

28:32.370 --> 28:33.675
Charming.

28:34.221 --> 28:36.725
And he's been...
change of clothing.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.286
- You haven't lost much weight, have you?
- I'm fine.

28:38.332 --> 28:40.206
Actually, mummy,
what I don't want is...

28:40.241 --> 28:43.287
Now we're looking into
is getting your record expunged.

28:43.682 --> 28:45.507
That would cost a pretty penny.

28:45.540 --> 28:47.536
- But I think it's time to...
- No.

28:47.582 --> 28:50.366
Mummy, I don't want that.

28:50.403 --> 28:53.187
No? No, Mummy?
I don't want what? What?

28:53.231 --> 28:56.187
Would you try to speak like
a semi-literate person, please, Helena?

28:56.222 --> 28:59.138
I know that you've been keeping
rather sordid company lately, but...

28:59.533 --> 29:02.187
I've been keeping very fine

29:02.230 --> 29:04.246
company, Mummy,
and what I don't want is for you

29:04.291 --> 29:07.318
to come swanning in here,
throwing your money about.

29:07.362 --> 29:09.086
I know I made a mistake.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.207
I'm quite happy to finish my time

29:11.243 --> 29:13.886
- and pay my debt to society.
- Helena,

29:13.932 --> 29:15.856
Helena, pull yourself together.

29:16.211 --> 29:19.126
For God's sake, you're a Peabody.

29:19.142 --> 29:22.918
- What difference does that make?
- Peabodys don't have debts, darling.

29:22.963 --> 29:24.495
Not to anyone.

29:24.533 --> 29:26.638
And certainly not

29:26.682 --> 29:28.696
to society.

29:34.071 --> 29:35.327
Thank you.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.398
...!

29:50.882 --> 29:53.016
- Robby, where is the jam?
- In the fridge, babe.

29:53.061 --> 29:54.648
Behind all the beer.

29:55.211 --> 29:58.336
Okay, everyone.
It's our favorite tradition.

29:58.373 --> 30:00.496
Morning mojitos. Bring it on!

30:12.494 --> 30:13.987
Finally!

30:15.672 --> 30:17.989
The artist has arrived!

30:21.483 --> 30:22.738
Everyone,

30:22.784 --> 30:25.146
- this is...
- The beautiful Bette!

30:27.963 --> 30:29.918
- Nice to meet you.
- It's so nice to meet you.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.898
It's a morning mojito.

30:31.944 --> 30:34.758
It's a Big Bear tradition.
You have to drink.

30:35.592 --> 30:38.306
You know what? It's a little bit early
for me. But thanks.

30:38.344 --> 30:40.597
Come on, Bette.

30:41.033 --> 30:42.658
Don't be such a wuss.

30:42.694 --> 30:47.079
It's good to put a face to those
grunts and groans.

30:47.692 --> 30:49.060
Last night...

30:49.502 --> 30:51.628
...you girls got in late, but uh...

30:51.675 --> 30:54.817
I guess you weren't too tired, huh?

30:55.244 --> 30:57.917
- It sounded good.
- Oh, fuck!

30:58.695 --> 31:00.690
Did everyone hear us?

31:05.394 --> 31:08.697
I left something in the room.

31:08.735 --> 31:10.400
I'll be right back.

31:12.183 --> 31:13.930
Is she alright?

31:15.685 --> 31:17.620
It's ridiculous.
She'll be fine, right?

31:17.663 --> 31:18.877
....

31:19.203 --> 31:20.660
To us.

31:21.144 --> 31:22.860
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

31:23.715 --> 31:24.897
So last night,

31:24.935 --> 31:27.537
I finally fulled that insurance paper
to claim for the fire.

31:27.975 --> 31:29.837
I'm telling you. It's been sitting
on my desk for three weeks, untouched.

31:29.872 --> 31:31.679
Last night I do it
and start to finish.

31:31.713 --> 31:34.707
- Good for you, Shane. It's good.
- And then I went in my closet.

31:34.745 --> 31:37.217
Got rid of all my old Converse
and all those low-ass jeans

31:37.255 --> 31:38.899
the you always see me in?
I start

31:38.934 --> 31:41.087
- prioritizing my life.
- What do you mean?

31:41.132 --> 31:43.507
You know, like setting goals
to myself. Like...

31:43.553 --> 31:45.570
Like I wanna see Shay
every three weeks.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.608
And I wanna quit smocking,
for sure.

31:48.986 --> 31:50.419
I'm telling you, Tina,

31:50.454 --> 31:52.361
this celibacy thing is like

31:52.404 --> 31:53.888
a master cleanse to my body.

31:53.893 --> 31:55.170
- Ya gotta try it.
- You know, Shane,

31:55.215 --> 31:57.730
I've gone long periods without sex.

31:57.745 --> 32:00.668
It doesn't have
the same salubrious effect on me.

32:00.703 --> 32:02.468
Salubrious?

32:02.505 --> 32:04.159
Yeah, salubrious.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.400
I like it.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.050
Salubrious.

32:09.554 --> 32:11.321
And the other thing I've been doing?

32:12.355 --> 32:14.980
Trying to expend my vocabulary.
Now, I go on to the dictionnary

32:15.014 --> 32:16.699
and try to memorize ten words a day.

32:16.743 --> 32:17.891
It actually works.

32:19.244 --> 32:21.320
So, anyway.
What are you gonna wear on your date?

32:21.355 --> 32:24.209
I don't know. What do you wear
on a date with a heart doctor?

32:25.624 --> 32:27.768
- "Krazyfaze" by Ping Pong Bitches -

32:49.975 --> 32:51.179
Cover up!

32:51.227 --> 32:52.531
Oh, I can't!

32:52.875 --> 32:53.832
Cover up!

32:58.266 --> 32:59.989
Bette! Bette!

33:02.196 --> 33:04.452
Come on, we need a wide receiver.
Come on!

33:04.476 --> 33:05.751
No, thank you.

33:06.195 --> 33:07.410
Come on!

33:22.706 --> 33:25.219
Michelangelo built
the Sixtine Chapel, you know.

33:25.267 --> 33:27.611
Actually, I think
he just painted the ceiling.

33:28.636 --> 33:29.911
The house...

33:30.296 --> 33:32.709
we call it the Sixtine Chapel.

33:34.167 --> 33:35.821
Built it with his bare hands.

33:36.266 --> 33:39.619
Put the log cabin in Wyoming.
That's where he spends most of the year.

33:42.705 --> 33:44.881
You're in violation, by the way.

33:45.925 --> 33:48.593
We don't allow work here,
at the Sixtine Chapel.

33:49.257 --> 33:50.680
Well, I guess I'll just

33:50.718 --> 33:52.593
have to get an infraction,

33:52.637 --> 33:54.600
or whatever the punishment is.

34:21.495 --> 34:23.503
Bette? Alright.

34:24.146 --> 34:27.063
Bette, we need to recruit you
under our team.

34:27.887 --> 34:30.030
- I don't really wanna play.
- Yeah.

34:30.067 --> 34:31.561
It's the lake

34:31.608 --> 34:32.902
or the game.

34:34.708 --> 34:37.750
- Uh, I'd like to stay here, thank you.
- Don't make me do it.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.800
- The lake or the game.
- Really, the book.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.192
Come on!

34:42.235 --> 34:45.951
Oh god! Hey, you asshole!

35:43.818 --> 35:45.405
How is it going?

35:49.190 --> 35:51.663
I don't know
how people do this.

35:51.709 --> 35:53.643
- Hey, Jenny.
- Shhh!

35:53.678 --> 35:55.543
She's meditating.

35:56.140 --> 35:57.565
The podcast.

35:58.577 --> 36:00.163
I haven't showed it to Alice yet.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.224
But I'd just really like your opinion.

36:07.878 --> 36:10.805
I can't.
I have to go to a screening.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.732
You said you'd look at it.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.554
But I'm late.
So, I'm gonna go.

36:15.027 --> 36:17.222
But I'm sure
it's gonna be good. Bye.

36:22.618 --> 36:24.953
Sorry!
I gotta go that way.

36:36.679 --> 36:38.613
Sorry.
I just forgot my keys!

36:43.191 --> 36:44.993
Fuck! I can't do this.

36:45.729 --> 36:46.914
I can't.

36:48.718 --> 36:49.993
What are you doing?

36:50.030 --> 36:51.865
I made this podcast.

36:54.199 --> 36:56.205
I haven't showed it to Alice yet.

36:56.630 --> 36:59.343
And I just really... I don't know.
I'm just looking for somebody's opinion.

36:59.388 --> 37:00.434
Well, I can tell you.

37:00.470 --> 37:02.006
Tell you what.
I'm gonna read it.

37:02.499 --> 37:03.963
Really?

37:04.679 --> 37:06.594
You want my opinion?

37:07.158 --> 37:09.436
- Sure.
- Oh great. I have ... since five.

37:09.471 --> 37:11.994
I haven't...
or bull shit. So what do I do?

37:12.519 --> 37:13.584
You uh...

37:14.079 --> 37:15.703
- Play?
- Yeah, right there.

37:34.749 --> 37:36.165
Hey, Bette,

37:36.211 --> 37:38.154
why don't you start the roux?

37:39.669 --> 37:43.334
I don't have the faintest idea
how to make a roux.

37:46.629 --> 37:48.107
Have a glass of wine.

37:48.141 --> 37:49.917
And we'll set the table.

37:59.690 --> 38:01.944
So, uh, Bette,

38:01.981 --> 38:03.677
what are you doing

38:03.720 --> 38:06.256
to help restore some
equinimity in this

38:06.290 --> 38:09.104
fucking ridiculous overpriced
art market?

38:10.170 --> 38:11.734
- What am I doing?
- Well,

38:11.772 --> 38:13.954
you're a big mover in the shaker,
aren't you?

38:14.731 --> 38:16.504
You can be doing something.

38:16.541 --> 38:19.117
Actually I'm the dean of
university art department.

38:19.152 --> 38:21.406
Okay, but...

38:21.452 --> 38:23.434
you're a big collector, right? So...

38:25.139 --> 38:26.944
Let me tell you about the show that

38:26.980 --> 38:29.997
occurated last month
at the Jacksonhall art center.

38:30.042 --> 38:33.224
I mean, 'cause they were at least

38:33.259 --> 38:37.908
ten paintings that would every be as good
as the Eric Fischl

38:37.943 --> 38:40.197
that you have in your collection.

38:40.271 --> 38:42.347
What makes you so sure
she's got an Eric Fischy?

38:43.221 --> 38:46.228
It's Fischl.

38:46.723 --> 38:48.707
Eric Fischl?

38:48.752 --> 38:52.505
And I bet that she has one.

38:54.252 --> 38:56.667
I doubt there were ten paintings
in a local art show

38:56.710 --> 38:57.786
that were

38:57.821 --> 39:00.156
even comparable to my Fischl.

39:05.033 --> 39:06.268
Be nice!

39:06.312 --> 39:07.937
I am, I am, I am!

39:08.711 --> 39:10.155
How can you doubt it?

39:10.200 --> 39:11.838
It just seems really unlikely

39:11.872 --> 39:13.987
that there are ten truely great paintings

39:14.032 --> 39:16.117
- in a community show.
- When was the last time

39:16.161 --> 39:18.536
that you've looked at art

39:18.583 --> 39:21.836
outside of New York or L.A.?

39:28.603 --> 39:29.947
You know, you're right.

39:29.981 --> 39:32.585
I haven't seen a community art show

39:32.622 --> 39:34.145
in a really long time.

39:35.742 --> 39:38.558
And I would love to see
some of the pieces

39:38.603 --> 39:40.209
that you're so excited about.

39:40.252 --> 39:41.239
Really?

39:42.103 --> 39:43.447
Awesome!

39:45.334 --> 39:48.316
I brought some pictures and uh,

39:48.324 --> 39:51.379
I could bring them down, say after

39:51.424 --> 39:52.688
dinner?

39:53.462 --> 39:54.969
That would be great.

39:56.224 --> 39:58.979
You rock my world.

40:02.192 --> 40:03.849
She's the best.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.596
I didn't know
that you were a collector.

40:27.643 --> 40:29.859
It didn't say that on your profile.

40:29.864 --> 40:32.276
I just started a couple of years ago.

40:32.314 --> 40:35.568
I'm sure it doesn't compare
to your ex's collection.

40:37.914 --> 40:39.630
No, no, it's...

40:39.673 --> 40:40.950
They're beautiful.

40:41.645 --> 40:43.637
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked
about my ex

40:43.673 --> 40:46.780
- so much at dinner.
- It's fine. It's fine.

40:46.824 --> 40:48.940
It was a big relationship for you.

40:49.682 --> 40:51.438
It's normal to talk about it.

40:52.063 --> 40:54.010
Would you like a glass of wine?

40:54.872 --> 40:56.830
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.463 --> 41:11.780
We'll pick that money.

41:44.866 --> 41:46.529
- "11:32 PM" by Gina Catalino -

41:59.674 --> 42:01.491
You have really great tits.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.750
Wow!

42:22.793 --> 42:24.188
Augmented.

42:26.025 --> 42:27.389
You went for it.

42:27.435 --> 42:28.759
You like them?

43:13.084 --> 43:15.060
Spread your legs open.

43:19.706 --> 43:21.749
Do you like it when I talk dirty?

43:23.936 --> 43:25.351
Yeah.

43:52.625 --> 43:54.040
We need to go.

43:54.677 --> 43:55.941
I'm sorry, but,

43:55.985 --> 43:57.810
my sister was robbed
and got pointed last night.

43:57.865 --> 43:59.131
Is she okay?

43:59.177 --> 44:01.422
She's freaked, but I, I just...
I really wanna get back

44:01.456 --> 44:02.970
before she starts drinking.

44:03.006 --> 44:04.412
Oh, the girl had a fucking gun
pointed at her.

44:04.456 --> 44:05.943
Let her have a drink.

44:05.976 --> 44:07.371
Uh, my sister is an alcoholic,

44:07.418 --> 44:10.110
so that would probably be
the worst thing I could do.

44:11.536 --> 44:15.280
I packed your suitcase.
So, we're ready to go.

44:19.105 --> 44:20.252
If you wanna stay,

44:20.298 --> 44:21.872
I'll drive you back.

44:23.548 --> 44:24.922
That's fine.

44:24.955 --> 44:26.750
If that's what you wanna do.

44:27.258 --> 44:30.001
No, of course not.
I'll go home with you.

44:46.627 --> 44:49.403
You were just making that up
back there, weren't you?

44:49.437 --> 44:51.094
'Cause you're just having such a lousy time.

44:51.138 --> 44:53.452
Oh, yeah, I just made up that
my sister got robbed at gunpoint

44:53.488 --> 44:54.662
to get out of bowling?

44:55.747 --> 44:57.801
Why would I ever want to give up
the opportunity

44:57.846 --> 45:01.311
to wear smelly used shoes, drink
warm domestic beer and kick your ass?

45:01.756 --> 45:03.372
Wait 'til next year.

45:03.417 --> 45:05.002
Nice to meet you.

45:26.718 --> 45:29.105
They took my whole week.

45:29.137 --> 45:31.243
Oh, sweetie, don't worry
about the money.

45:32.609 --> 45:34.633
I'm just so glad
they didn't hurt you.

45:37.398 --> 45:39.994
I'm just gonna be in the next room
if you need anything.

45:41.430 --> 45:43.062
And now, you go to sleep.

45:52.860 --> 45:54.605
She'll be okay.

46:28.751 --> 46:31.833
They're taking my whole fucking life
away from me.

46:42.351 --> 46:43.953
Hey, Kit. Are you alright?

46:43.991 --> 46:45.895
I'm really sorry about what happened.

46:45.939 --> 46:49.445
Oh, no, thanks. It's alright. I just...
I should just get busy.

46:51.610 --> 46:53.376
She's free!

46:56.309 --> 46:57.555
- Hi!
- Welcome back.

46:57.589 --> 46:58.985
Thank you.

46:59.021 --> 47:01.075
Thanks.
I'm so glad you all came.

47:01.628 --> 47:03.796
I just wanna say, you know,
good bye

47:03.828 --> 47:06.014
- before I leave.
- Where are you going?

47:06.050 --> 47:08.003
Wait, wait, wait.
Isn't there gonna be a trial?

47:08.039 --> 47:10.835
Actually, our family
doesn't go on trial.

47:10.868 --> 47:12.616
We generally go to Europe.

47:13.521 --> 47:16.044
Are you leaving the country
before the trial?

47:16.091 --> 47:17.484
We've got Brandon Addict.

47:17.529 --> 47:19.906
He's the best criminal attorney
in California.

47:19.909 --> 47:21.814
He's gonna get this record expunged.

47:21.849 --> 47:23.513
Until then, we will be recovering

47:23.550 --> 47:25.726
from our ignominy in the country
with a

47:25.770 --> 47:28.395
very healthy non-extradiction treaty.

47:28.439 --> 47:30.014
I can't believe you're leaving.

47:30.060 --> 47:31.337
Well, I only wish I could say

47:31.381 --> 47:34.044
it was because I thought
Helena had learnt her lesson.

47:35.201 --> 47:37.744
- But I can assure you that...
- What does she mean by that?

47:37.791 --> 47:41.465
any future rehabilitation of Helena's character
will be imposed under a more

47:41.509 --> 47:43.814
rigorous program than the

47:43.849 --> 47:47.285
Los Angeles lesbian lifestyle can provide.

47:49.391 --> 47:53.067
At least Paris, when she was in the clink,
didn't get involved with some

47:53.100 --> 47:56.457
big butch prison daddy dyke.
