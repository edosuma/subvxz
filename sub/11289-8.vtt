WEBVTT

00:04.466 --> 00:06.866
Whoo! Nay‐nay.

00:06.933 --> 00:10.133
This is the best seafood gumbo
I've ever had.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.400
Girl, where did you learn
to cook like this?

00:12.466 --> 00:14.466
My mother.
She was a lousy cook.

00:14.533 --> 00:17.966
So I either had to learn
or starve to death.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.966
You know, I was ten
before I realized

00:20.033 --> 00:21.966
that gravy doesn't have skin.

00:24.933 --> 00:27.600
Now, you know
what I like with my dinner.

00:27.666 --> 00:29.200
A little dessert.

00:33.833 --> 00:37.100
Boy! Something smells good
up in here.

00:38.966 --> 00:42.333
It's called a relationship.
Get out.

00:47.466 --> 00:49.133
[sneezes]

00:49.200 --> 00:51.566
Ooh, now that's just right.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.966
See, I was born on the Bayou.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.300
Yeah, well. Bye, you.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.440
So, uh, next time..

01:07.106 --> 01:08.973
...we do this at your place.

01:09.039 --> 01:11.873
You know, it's funny
you should say that.

01:13.706 --> 01:18.340
Regine, how would you feel,
about moving in with me?

01:20.973 --> 01:22.906
Movin' in?

01:22.973 --> 01:25.206
Baby, I don't know, I mean..

01:25.273 --> 01:28.506
...you know, trade this cramped
apartment with two roommates

01:28.573 --> 01:33.873
and one bathroom for, a mansion
with the man that I adore

01:33.940 --> 01:37.073
and an army of servants.. Hmm..

01:37.140 --> 01:39.706

Baby, it's here at last.

02:18.679 --> 02:21.680
Tickets for tomorrows
O State Michigan game.

02:21.746 --> 02:24.446
Oh, good, football.

02:24.513 --> 02:25.646
Yeah.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.746
My Cousin Damien
is the starting quarterback.

02:27.813 --> 02:29.680
You know Uncle Smoke Eye's
youngest son?

02:29.746 --> 02:32.513
Girl, we gonna be telling this
story to our grand kids

02:32.580 --> 02:34.080
till they pull the plug on us.

02:34.146 --> 02:35.280
Oh, would you look at this?

02:35.346 --> 02:37.380
A fabric softener sample.

02:37.446 --> 02:39.480
I figured we leave tonight
and get there in time

02:39.546 --> 02:41.480
for the predawn tail gate party.

02:41.546 --> 02:44.480
And then we enter the holiest
of holies, Ohio stadium.

02:44.546 --> 02:46.746
The Horseshoe.
Yeah. Think about it, baby.

02:46.813 --> 02:49.013
Us just sittin' there,
drinking beer

02:49.080 --> 02:51.680
and eating hot dogs
and hoping our frozen fingers

02:51.746 --> 02:53.780
don't snap off
like brittle twigs.

02:55.313 --> 02:57.346
Oh, well, I‐I can picture
all that, Obie.

02:57.413 --> 02:58.980
‐ Yeah..
‐ Except one thing's missing.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.353
‐ Oh, what's that, girl?
‐ Me.

03:03.086 --> 03:05.120
Obie, I hate football.

03:09.053 --> 03:11.853
Wait a minute.
Now, this just can't be.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.053
Now, wait a minute.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.286
Didn't you go with me
to all those Jets games

03:15.353 --> 03:16.386
when we were datin'?

03:16.453 --> 03:18.253
Yeah, but we were datin'.

03:20.153 --> 03:22.686
Come on, man. Now, get
your drunk butt off the porch.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.220
Oh, Khadijah.

03:26.286 --> 03:27.486
Hey, you want to go with me

03:27.553 --> 03:29.220
to the O State
Michigan game tomorrow?

03:29.286 --> 03:32.886
I mean, you not repulsed by the
world's greatest sport, are you?

03:32.953 --> 03:34.986
‐ 'No, I'm down with that.'
‐ Cool.

03:35.053 --> 03:38.720
Sure. Drinking beer,
eating hot dogs.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.786
Watching 22 Titans run up
and down the field.

03:44.053 --> 03:47.553
Oh, hold it. I'm sure
you've got one of these.

03:49.053 --> 03:51.520
"You are cordially invited
to a high tea this Saturday

03:51.586 --> 03:53.953
"where Ms. Regine Hunter
will make an announcement

03:54.020 --> 03:57.586
of great social
and political import."

03:57.653 --> 03:58.820
What the hell is this?

04:00.420 --> 04:03.660
Regine, whatever this drama
is, I cant make it.

04:03.726 --> 04:05.493
Oh, but you have to.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.060
It's a critical
turning point in my life.

04:08.126 --> 04:09.593
And I already did
the calligraphy

04:09.660 --> 04:10.760
on your place card.

04:10.826 --> 04:13.193
Oh. Oh, wait now.
This is big.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.093
The last time she calligraphized

04:15.160 --> 04:18.093
was when she announced that
she was becoming a vegetarian.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.260
Girl, you started
eating pork‐chops again.

04:23.126 --> 04:25.426
Alright, if you must know

04:25.493 --> 04:28.093
Dexter asked me to move in
and I accepted.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.460
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh! My God!

04:33.159 --> 04:35.193
Hey, look,
I‐I'm happy for you too.

04:35.259 --> 04:37.893
But Overton just invited me
to the Ohio State game.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.926
Now, can't you have
this tea party

04:39.993 --> 04:42.560
in the stadium parking lot
or something?

04:42.626 --> 04:44.693
‐ Ohio State Michigan?
‐ Yeah.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.660
Man that, man that game's
been sold out for months.

04:46.726 --> 04:48.793
Look, please tell me
you've got an extra ticket

04:48.860 --> 04:50.260
for the brother that makes
the blueberry pancakes

04:50.326 --> 04:52.660
you said you'd go to war for.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.793
Well, I might,
let's just see

04:53.860 --> 04:56.226
how this little scenario,
uh, works out.

04:56.293 --> 04:57.260
Shall we?

04:58.326 --> 04:59.993
Alright, now, Khadijah, look.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.200
This is not some frivolous
girl party, alright?

05:02.266 --> 05:05.800
I need, I need my friends,
my girls around me

05:05.866 --> 05:07.433
when I tell mom.

05:07.500 --> 05:11.233
She doesn't usually fake
a seizure when there's company.

05:11.300 --> 05:14.100
So once again you're using us.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.300
Just one last time.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.133
‐ Get off of me.
‐ Yes!

05:27.133 --> 05:30.866
Regine, I came over
as soon as I heard

05:30.933 --> 05:32.466
that you were moving out.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.466
Oh, no, I did dance around
a little bit..

05:38.000 --> 05:39.900
Don't hide your pain, Max,
how do you really feel.

05:39.966 --> 05:42.266
Just let it out.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.733
You know, I can't even believe
that you cool

05:43.800 --> 05:45.700
with this living together thing.

05:45.766 --> 05:47.133
I mean, you cried for days when

05:47.200 --> 05:49.733
Oprah let Stedman move in.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.600
So what? You, you think
I'm makin' a mistake?

05:51.666 --> 05:54.633
No, no, absolutely not.
No, come one.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.700
I'll help you pack, girl,
come on. Let's go.

05:59.366 --> 06:00.606
Alright, look.

06:00.673 --> 06:03.840
Dexter and I are headed
to the altar eventually.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.506
You know,
I mean in the meantime..

06:05.573 --> 06:07.906
Hey, why shouldn't we share
every moment

06:07.973 --> 06:09.840
that we can together?

06:09.906 --> 06:11.873
And if that's what you're
going to say to Mother Hunter

06:11.940 --> 06:14.706
you've got your work
cut out for you.

06:14.773 --> 06:18.540
Regine, I heard the news
of your impending co‐habitation

06:18.606 --> 06:21.740
and I'm here to extend
my sincerest good wishes.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.473
Russell, that is so sweet.

06:24.540 --> 06:27.673
And so totally not you.

06:27.740 --> 06:31.440
Oh, I'm full of surprises,
Here's another one.

06:31.506 --> 06:32.506
Marry me.

06:34.473 --> 06:37.173
Okay, Regine,
I'mma go warm up the car.

06:42.073 --> 06:44.840
Russell, I'm, I'm speechless.

06:47.106 --> 06:51.006
Oh, um..

06:51.073 --> 06:53.806
Let's give
the lovebirds some privacy.

06:53.873 --> 06:58.606
Oh, I'm staying.
I want to hear her answer.

06:58.673 --> 07:01.546
Sweetie, it's beautiful.
It really is and..

07:02.680 --> 07:04.746
When the right woman comes along

07:04.813 --> 07:09.180
I know that she will love it
and you very much.

07:17.380 --> 07:19.846
You're an elegant woman, Regine.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.080
Come now, shimmy for me
one last time.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.046
Go ahead, girl.

07:34.513 --> 07:37.746
I'll carry this memory
to my grave.

07:37.813 --> 07:39.380
I may belong to another man

07:39.446 --> 07:42.280
but my shimmy will always
belong to you.

07:46.446 --> 07:47.746
Look, Synclaire..

07:47.813 --> 07:49.246
...I don't want
to sound ungrateful

07:49.313 --> 07:52.080
but we, we just going
to the game, not catering it.

07:52.146 --> 07:53.813
Yeah.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.213
Gentlemen, when you are going
on a road trip

07:56.280 --> 07:59.446
you can never have enough gas,
food and clean underwear.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.920
Oh, so that explains
the Ziploc bag full of Jockey's.

08:04.486 --> 08:06.453
Overton, if you're bound
for the road

08:06.520 --> 08:07.853
please take me with you.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.386
I need to drive away my pain

08:09.453 --> 08:11.720
on an endless stretch
of blue highway.

08:11.786 --> 08:13.520
Oh, cool, then join the party.

08:13.586 --> 08:16.253
Lord knows we've got enough
food and drawers for everybody.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.086
Right, man.

08:19.153 --> 08:21.553
My customized van
is at your disposal.

08:21.620 --> 08:24.853
It has very few miles on it
and only one previous owner.

08:28.453 --> 08:29.920
One owner, huh?

08:29.986 --> 08:32.986
What did he use this van for?
Voodoo ceremonies?

08:33.986 --> 08:35.653
Man, I don't care if you drag me

08:35.720 --> 08:37.653
behind this buck
in a little red wagon.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.720
I'm going to
the O State Michigan game, eh?

08:40.785 --> 08:43.120
I'll never forget the first time
dad and Uncle Smoke Eye

08:43.186 --> 08:44.586
took me down to Columbia.

08:44.653 --> 08:48.020
Ten below zero,
up in the nosebleed seats.

08:48.086 --> 08:51.186
When Jim Holders ran that
kickoff back for a touchdown

08:51.253 --> 08:53.853
I spit my pacifier
right out my mouth.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.253
Man, the law of
American football is beyond me.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.660
Women's soccer? Whoo!
Now, that's a game.

09:03.726 --> 09:07.593
A very good way to meet
large aggressive women.

09:09.226 --> 09:12.526
Hey, man, how do you cut
the heat down on this thing?

09:12.593 --> 09:15.660
Hotter in here than two
boll weevils in wool socks.

09:16.826 --> 09:18.526
Actually it is off.

09:18.593 --> 09:20.360
What you're feeling
is the heat coming off

09:20.426 --> 09:22.393
our slightly cracked
engine block.

09:22.460 --> 09:23.693
Oh, man!

09:29.060 --> 09:31.160
Now, that's much better.

09:31.226 --> 09:33.693
What is that blasphemous word
written across

09:33.760 --> 09:36.293
your puny little chest?

09:36.360 --> 09:38.393
I'm just a Michigan fan.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.526
Go blue.

09:41.126 --> 09:42.926
You a Wolverine?

09:42.993 --> 09:44.560
Russell, pull the van over.

09:44.626 --> 09:48.693
No, on second thoughts, just
speed up and open up the door.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.360
No, man,
I already got one ticket

09:50.426 --> 09:52.360
for dumping
a foreign object. No.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.326
Is that a mirage with legs?

10:00.393 --> 10:05.600
Has God sent me a beautiful
budding flower to heal my pain?

10:05.666 --> 10:07.933
No, no, we are not picking up
some stranger

10:08.000 --> 10:09.766
man, she could be
a serial‐killer.

10:09.833 --> 10:12.066
‐ Hey, guys.
‐ 'Hey, girl.'

10:12.133 --> 10:13.766
Who you for?
O State or Michigan?

10:13.833 --> 10:15.233
Buckeye to the bone.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.033
‐ Oh, well, get on the bus!
‐ Yeah!

10:23.866 --> 10:27.700
♪ Fight the team
across the field ♪

10:27.766 --> 10:30.900
♪ Show them Ohio's here ♪

10:30.966 --> 10:32.666
Do you know what a buckeye is?

10:32.733 --> 10:35.600
It's an inedible nut that falls
to the ground and lies there.

10:35.666 --> 10:38.700
Oh, like your players.

10:38.766 --> 10:40.833
And you know what would happen
to a Wolverine's head

10:40.900 --> 10:43.233
if a Buckeye hit it
at a 100 miles an hour?

10:43.300 --> 10:46.266
No, but I know one thing,
I know one thing‐‐

10:46.333 --> 10:48.733
Quiet! Quiet now, quiet now!

10:48.800 --> 10:51.466
Now, your squabbling will awaken
my sleeping angel.

10:53.266 --> 10:55.600
What she needs is the soothing
sound of reggae music.

10:55.666 --> 10:56.766
(man on radio)
'On the local front'

10:56.833 --> 10:58.900
'the manhunt continues
for Camille Harris.'

10:58.966 --> 11:02.240
'Suspected in a spree
of convenience store hold‐ups.'

11:02.306 --> 11:06.373
'She was last seen hitch‐hiking
outside of Pittsburgh.'

11:06.440 --> 11:09.340
Hold up now, uh,
uh, didn't we pick up girlie

11:09.406 --> 11:11.306
right outside Pittsburgh?

11:11.373 --> 11:14.340
'Witnesses describe her
as being about 5'2"'

11:14.406 --> 11:17.073
'with a tattoo of a penguin
on her left wrist.'

11:17.140 --> 11:20.273
‐ Oh?
‐ 'What the..'

11:21.706 --> 11:24.573
Gimme that.
This is not a penguin.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.873
That's a bird wearin' a tuxedo.

11:27.973 --> 11:30.840
We are all going to die.

11:30.906 --> 11:33.240
Just chill out,
brave Wolverine.

11:33.306 --> 11:36.006
We'll pull this van over
and we'll come up with a plan.

11:39.806 --> 11:42.873
Look, that woman's a disgrace
to Buckeye fans everywhere.

11:42.940 --> 11:44.940
I say we leave her here
and get our bus to the game.

11:45.006 --> 11:45.940
‐ Yeah that's what I'm saying.
‐ No, no, no.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.373
Let us not act rationally.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.306
Now this is obviously a case
of mistaken identity.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.673
Whoo! How about that.

11:58.740 --> 12:00.713
Most women can't drive a stick.

12:07.013 --> 12:08.746
Baby girl,
I know why I'm here

12:08.813 --> 12:11.713
so stop stalling
and show me the rock!

12:13.180 --> 12:15.113
I bet it's as big
as that door knob.

12:16.713 --> 12:21.880
Mom, um, I, I didn't call you
over to announce my engagement.

12:21.946 --> 12:25.213
‐ Um, ladies.
‐ Oh, yes.

12:25.280 --> 12:30.046
Um, Dexter and I
are movin' in together.

12:39.346 --> 12:42.946
Congratulations.
I'm very happy for you.

12:44.313 --> 12:46.013
Maybe you didn't hear her!

12:46.080 --> 12:49.380
She said that they are moving
in together in the same house

12:49.446 --> 12:51.146
in the same bed.

12:53.213 --> 12:54.780
I heard.

12:54.846 --> 12:58.346
And as long as she's happy,
that's all that matters.

13:04.320 --> 13:08.220
I was expecting fireworks
and this is what I get?

13:08.286 --> 13:13.720
As usual, Regine,
you are a big disappointment.

13:13.786 --> 13:17.353
That was the worst reaction
I could've ever expected.

13:17.420 --> 13:22.453
Anger I could deal with,
but...being polite?

13:22.520 --> 13:25.220
Wishing me well.
Not raining on my parade.

13:25.286 --> 13:29.953
Now, that is just
plain...hateful.

13:30.020 --> 13:33.153
You know, your mother
is...worse than

13:33.220 --> 13:36.286
Penny's mom on "Good Times."

13:36.353 --> 13:37.853
That's what I'm saying.

13:42.186 --> 13:47.453
Oh, excuse me, officer, uh, we
need to report a stolen vehicle.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.853
It was a highly customized
classic 1967 Volkswagen bus

13:51.920 --> 13:55.253
with...patches of
the original paint still on it.

13:56.520 --> 14:00.060
If you're talkin' about
a dig little hippie bus

14:00.126 --> 14:02.693
with a "Hemp for health"
bumper sticker?

14:02.760 --> 14:05.226
We've got it in impound.

14:05.293 --> 14:07.160
Unfortunately
right after we towed it here

14:07.226 --> 14:09.793
it burst into flames.

14:09.860 --> 14:11.226
There he is, officer.
That's him.

14:11.293 --> 14:12.593
That's the freak
that let me drive away

14:12.660 --> 14:15.160
in their broke down
hooty from hell.

14:15.226 --> 14:18.726
Girl, you got more nerve
than a pick‐pocket in church.

14:18.793 --> 14:21.626
You better butt out of it,
curly.

14:21.693 --> 14:22.960
You're a menace to society.

14:23.026 --> 14:24.960
If I ever get out, I'mma
come back and hunt you down

14:25.026 --> 14:26.760
like the dog you are.

14:26.826 --> 14:29.960
Did you see that fire,
that passion?

14:30.026 --> 14:32.660
I'll wait for you,
my lovely felon.

14:36.093 --> 14:39.493
Russ, have you ever thought
about going after a woman

14:39.560 --> 14:42.560
that you might have a chance
in hell of getting?

14:42.626 --> 14:45.393
Man, all I know is, there's
three minutes before kick‐off

14:45.460 --> 14:47.493
and we stuck out here
in the boonie.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.326
We've got
a black and white out back.

14:49.393 --> 14:52.393
You expect me to watch my cousin
lead the Buckeyes to victory

14:52.460 --> 14:54.160
on a black and white TV?

14:54.226 --> 14:57.260
Oh, relax man,
it's just a game, huh?

14:57.326 --> 14:59.226
A game, you say?

14:59.293 --> 15:01.766
No, no
not where I come from.

15:01.833 --> 15:04.233
See? Cleveland
is a simple place.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.666
Blue collar town
with hard‐working people.

15:07.733 --> 15:12.000
See, when I was growing up,
car plants and steel mills

15:12.066 --> 15:13.900
were closing down
left and right.

15:13.966 --> 15:16.700
Jobs were hard to come by.
And hope?

15:16.766 --> 15:19.800
Hope was just the name
of our local librarian

15:22.100 --> 15:23.900
So the only thing
that kept us alive

15:23.966 --> 15:25.966
was O State football
on Saturday

15:26.033 --> 15:27.266
and the Browns on Sunday.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.200
Man, some of my best memories

15:29.266 --> 15:32.300
are with my dad down on those
frozen stadium benches.

15:32.366 --> 15:35.200
And then, Art Modale
cold jacked the Browns

15:35.266 --> 15:39.400
like an armored truck with
the keys left in the ignition.

15:39.466 --> 15:41.833
So now, all we got left
is O State.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.266
So if it's
all the same to you, officer

15:44.333 --> 15:47.833
I'd rather die trying to get
there than to watch my Buckeye

15:47.900 --> 15:50.700
on your black and or white TV.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.033
I meant a black and white
squad car.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.266
If you throw on
the lights and sirens

15:58.333 --> 16:00.273
I can get you there
in three hours.

16:01.406 --> 16:04.740
Oh. Alright, let's bounce.

16:09.173 --> 16:12.106
[cheering]

16:20.606 --> 16:21.906
Come on, man,
the game's almost over

16:21.973 --> 16:23.273
we've got to get to our seats.

16:23.340 --> 16:25.906
Oh, yo, you might want to cover
that up, man. Buckeye country.

16:25.973 --> 16:27.940
Oh, brother, please.
I am strong.

16:28.006 --> 16:30.740
I am proud. I am a Wolverine!

16:39.606 --> 16:41.873
Now, you're strong,
proud and naked.

16:44.740 --> 16:46.673
(male announcer)
'Ohio State calls
their final time‐out.'

16:46.740 --> 16:48.306
‐ Oh, hey!
‐ Hey.

16:48.373 --> 16:49.940
Look who finally showed up.

16:50.006 --> 16:53.173
My fast talking New York nephew.
Hey, come here, boy!

16:53.240 --> 16:54.473
Uncle Smoke Eye!

16:54.540 --> 16:55.873
I thought you were dead!

16:55.940 --> 16:57.673
Only reason you'd miss
a big game like this.

16:57.740 --> 16:59.006
I know!

16:59.073 --> 17:00.546
And who's your naked friend?

17:00.613 --> 17:03.646
Hey, hey, I'm, I'm Tripp.
Can I borrow your coat?

17:03.713 --> 17:05.280
Hell, no!

17:05.346 --> 17:06.913
Y'all settle in.
We're five points down.

17:06.980 --> 17:08.646
My boy is driving
the team down the field.

17:08.713 --> 17:10.945
Alright.
Oh, excuse me, dawg.

17:11.012 --> 17:13.046
‐ I think you're in my seat.
‐ Uh, look, bro.

17:13.113 --> 17:18.313
Two hours and fifty bucks ago,
this became my seat.

17:18.380 --> 17:21.246
Wait are you trying to tell me
somebody sold my seat?

17:21.313 --> 17:24.380
Well, like I said, son,
I thought you were dead.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.113
(man on radio)
'Well, it all comes
down to this.'

17:31.180 --> 17:32.446
'Just five seconds on the clock'

17:32.513 --> 17:34.313
'this is the last play
of the game.'

17:34.380 --> 17:35.880
'Alright, Damon Howard
takes the snap'

17:35.946 --> 17:38.613
'fades back into the pocket
Can't find a receiver!'

17:38.680 --> 17:40.580
'Scrambles to the left!
Scrambles right!'

17:40.646 --> 17:43.880
'Fights it over, he dives in,
touchdown! Ohio State!'

17:44.746 --> 17:47.680
[cheering]

17:52.780 --> 17:56.580
Yeah, boy.
I told you it was our year.

17:56.646 --> 17:58.113
That's Obie right there,
see him?

17:58.180 --> 17:59.413
I know my man when I see him.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.720
That's him right there.
Look, look.

18:00.786 --> 18:03.453
You know what my mom is
in there doing, don't you?

18:03.520 --> 18:06.820
See, it's that old passive
aggressive routine of hers.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.820
She's just going to stay
in there until I

18:08.886 --> 18:10.353
until I just get worn down.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.853
But you know what?
Not this time.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.386
You know what? I, I,
I'm just going to pack my bags.

18:16.453 --> 18:18.820
‐ And I am going to‐‐
‐ Move!

18:21.920 --> 18:24.986
Move, to the Hamptons
with my man.

18:25.053 --> 18:28.186
And if I never see her again,
well, smooches to her!

18:28.253 --> 18:30.320
Don't you talk
about your mother that way.

18:30.386 --> 18:32.020
‐ How you gonna smooch her?
‐ How could you say that?

18:32.086 --> 18:33.553
‐ It's your mother.
‐ Oh, my goodness!

18:33.620 --> 18:35.586
I never speak to
my mother like that.

18:35.653 --> 18:37.720
‐ What're you talking about?
‐ Listen here, Miss Missy.

18:37.786 --> 18:40.720
My mother and I have
a special relationship.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.953
So do Khadijah and her mom.

18:43.020 --> 18:45.020
Yours is a twisted one.

18:46.086 --> 18:48.786
Strangely, it works.
Go fix it.

18:50.420 --> 18:54.853
Alright...I will be
the bigger person.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.020
But then, Khadijah,
I'm going to need

18:56.086 --> 18:58.820
the number to your therapist.

18:58.886 --> 19:01.193
Therapist? Man, you see somebody
once or twice

19:01.260 --> 19:03.360
and now you've got a therapist.

19:03.426 --> 19:05.293
‐ What's up with that?
‐ I know.

19:08.026 --> 19:10.660
Okay, um, here I am..

19:11.560 --> 19:13.093
So let me have it.

19:14.426 --> 19:17.593
Do you girls ever clean out
this refrigerator?

19:17.660 --> 19:21.093
I just found my casserole
from the Fourth of July.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.893
Well, I won't have
to worry about that

19:24.960 --> 19:29.826
when I move in with Dexter,
because he's got a live‐in maid.

19:29.893 --> 19:30.826
Hmm.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.593
That was your opening, ma.

19:36.660 --> 19:39.460
This is where you yell and,
and start hollering

19:39.526 --> 19:41.726
about how I'm such
a disappointment

19:41.793 --> 19:44.326
and oh,
how I will be living in sin

19:44.393 --> 19:46.126
and, and how will
you ever break this

19:46.193 --> 19:47.860
to your bowling league.

19:51.693 --> 19:53.526
Get mad!

19:55.760 --> 19:58.726
I'm not mad at you, baby girl.

19:58.793 --> 20:00.600
I'm hurting for you.

20:03.933 --> 20:06.400
Look, now, I didn't
just meet you, Regina.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.400
I've known you all your life.

20:09.800 --> 20:13.966
And I know that, moving in
with Dexter without marrying him

20:14.033 --> 20:15.466
is not what you want.

20:15.533 --> 20:19.300
Okay, alright, so..
So I do want it all.

20:19.366 --> 20:20.500
But what,
what am I supposed to do

20:20.566 --> 20:22.766
tell Dexter
and risk losing him?

20:24.733 --> 20:26.466
Ma, he's the one.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.266
If that's the case,
then you should be able

20:31.333 --> 20:32.733
to tell him the truth.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.066
And if he can't hear it, well..

20:36.133 --> 20:38.200
Maybe he's not the one.

20:38.266 --> 20:41.200
[piano music]

20:54.000 --> 20:57.866
Baby, what, what is
all of this fabulousness?

20:59.973 --> 21:02.040
This is the song
that I always dreamed

21:02.106 --> 21:04.040
would be played at my wedding.

21:06.006 --> 21:08.006
I'd like you to be there
to hear it too.

21:16.606 --> 21:18.006
Regine..

21:21.706 --> 21:22.673
...will you marry me?

21:22.740 --> 21:23.773
[gasps]

21:29.740 --> 21:32.240
Are you alright?

21:32.306 --> 21:33.406
Yes.

21:33.473 --> 21:35.040
Yes? Yes?

21:35.106 --> 21:36.040
‐ Yes.
‐ Yes.

21:36.106 --> 21:37.840
Yes! Yes.

21:37.906 --> 21:38.840
Yes!

21:44.306 --> 21:45.673
‐ 'We're getting married!'
‐ 'Uh‐huh.'

21:45.740 --> 21:46.773
We're getting married!

21:46.840 --> 21:48.806
‐ We, we..
‐ Whoo!

21:56.473 --> 21:58.606
[theme music]
