WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:04.178
Thank youfor coming in to interview

00:04.221 --> 00:05.440
for the principal position,Mrs. Huang.

00:05.483 --> 00:08.095
My pleasure. Thank you
for agreeing to meet.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.401
Now, what specific ideasdo you have

00:10.445 --> 00:12.055
to improve our school?

00:12.099 --> 00:13.274
Trick question.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.276
Only a fool would
give ideas for free.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.668
I'll answer
when I'm on payroll.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.279
And why are you talking

00:18.322 --> 00:20.281
in a regionally incorrect
British accent?

00:20.324 --> 00:22.718
To get into the part.Like you asked.

00:22.761 --> 00:25.329
In your detailedand demanding voicemail.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.984
No accent, but I do
like the glasses.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.160
Makes you look like you have
the IQ of a brunette.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.293
Okay.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.642
As principal,

00:33.685 --> 00:35.731
how would you let goof a bad employee?

00:35.774 --> 00:38.125
Quickly and off
a 4-story building. Next.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.214
Jessica...

00:40.257 --> 00:41.519
You asked me to help.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.651
Stop joking around.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.957
Honey, private schools
are competitive.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.307
My résumé is perfect,

00:46.350 --> 00:48.309
and I want my interview
to be perfect, too.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.528
Sure, I know
I can rely on my looks,

00:50.572 --> 00:53.140
but I want to be hired
for what's in here.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.316
Not for all this.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.144
Now, start over.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.798
Hi, Jessica.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.018
So nice to meet you.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.193
Tell me about yourself.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.239
What? What now?

01:05.282 --> 01:07.110
Most interviewers
offer water.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.156
"Can I get you some water,
Mrs. Huang?"

01:09.199 --> 01:10.374
Fine.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.594
Mrs. Huang,would you like some water?

01:12.637 --> 01:14.117
Oh, no, thank you.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.597
But I willtake some tea.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.519

01:39.838 --> 01:40.970
In my experience,

01:41.013 --> 01:42.798
most interviewsstart and end with one...

01:42.841 --> 01:44.930
if the interviewer
is a woman.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.889
A too-long hug
if it's a man.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.544
Ow!

01:49.587 --> 01:50.980
Ow! My darts hand!

01:51.023 --> 01:52.503
My hands are so strong

01:52.547 --> 01:54.766
from pulling myself up
by my own bootstraps.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.638
She's got the grip
of a chimpanzee.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.422
We blow through doorknobs
around here.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.555
Wait, you asked Honey
to help you find a job

02:00.598 --> 02:02.774
and not the business consultant
you live with?

02:02.818 --> 02:05.212
Way to kiss
a gift horse on the mouth.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.517
I think the saying is

02:06.561 --> 02:09.085
"Don't look a gift horsein the mouth."

02:09.129 --> 02:10.826
That doesn't make sense.Wrong.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.176
Jessica, you're right.
Maybe it's best I don't help.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.569
You're used to me
as your husband,

02:14.612 --> 02:16.310
not brutally honest,
straightforward,

02:16.353 --> 02:18.050
no-emotion Business Louis.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.401
No emotion? I would love it ifyou were like that all the time.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.012
Have you, uh,
networked with Deidre yet?

02:23.055 --> 02:24.405
She's on the board
at a private school.

02:24.448 --> 02:25.971
Deidre?

02:26.015 --> 02:28.670
The "networking" I do with her
is not exactly positive.

02:35.851 --> 02:39.115
Hey. You wanted to borrow thesefor Honey's surprise party?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.291
There's a surprise
for you too --

02:41.335 --> 02:42.336
you're not invited.

02:42.379 --> 02:45.034
Did you want meto set these up in the kitchen

02:45.077 --> 02:46.470
or up your ass?

02:48.342 --> 02:49.778
Yeah, that's not
bridge-building.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.040
But, luckily, you have me.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.216
Deidre and I have a fruitful
business relationship.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.218
I buy all my hair products
from her.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.133
She only sells
women'sproducts.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.134
Mm-hmm.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.222
$50 of monthly hair products

02:59.266 --> 03:01.224
doesn't just build
a lustrous sheen.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.443
It builds a friendship.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.053
Jessica, let me help.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.924
I know I can get you
the job of your dreams.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.926
Well, I guess
it can't hurt.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.885
Plus, Honey,
you're doing terrible.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.626
You took 20 minutes
to make tea.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.370
Here.Saved my crusts for you.

03:16.413 --> 03:19.068
Yes. Papa loves
his "Emery Sticks."

03:19.111 --> 03:22.376
Compadres! Why don't we switchthe channel over to "ESS-PEN,"

03:22.419 --> 03:24.726
'cause this Huang is nowa high school athlete.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.380
The high school's desperatefor Mathletes,

03:26.423 --> 03:27.903
so they're recruitingthe top eighth grader.

03:27.946 --> 03:31.385
Their team is about to...multiply.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.300
That's the little "x" one,
right?

03:33.343 --> 03:34.388
Mm.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.477
I'm on my wayto completing the Iron Man.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.175
Science fair, Mathletes,

03:39.219 --> 03:41.090
and one day,
the spelling bee.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.527
I wish it was a smelling bee.
I'd dominate.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.747
I smelled almost 30 things
yesterday.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.531
I'll be therea few times a week for practice.

03:47.575 --> 03:48.837
We can all hang out.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.188
Three Huang boys,one underfunded high school.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.628
Who am I kidding?
I couldn't win a smelling bee.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.501
Some of those kids have been
training their entire lives.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.942
Thanks for the invite, Louis.I had no idea you guys played.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.161
Ah, the hitting, the walking,
the basic arithmetic.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.728
Can't get enough of it.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.208
Okay.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.515
This is hell.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.647
Sure, but sometimes you have to
endure a little hardship

04:16.691 --> 04:18.301
for the good
of the big picture --

04:18.345 --> 04:19.520
play the long game.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.738
Louis, don't annoy me.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.523
I have spikeson the bottom of my shoes.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.525
Well, making connections
requires finesse.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.309
You have to massage
the relationship
before asking favors.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.180
Finesse? Massage?

04:28.224 --> 04:30.313
You gotta stop watchingthose shampoo commercials.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.489
Focus. This is step 1
of many.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.926
Amazing shot,
Deidre!

04:36.014 --> 04:37.364
Now, slowly start
to butter her up.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.583
Ask her about
her side makeup company.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.497
Hey, Deidre, great golf.

04:40.541 --> 04:41.716
How's your makeup thing?

04:41.759 --> 04:42.804
Oof! Let me tell you.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.588
Our glitter shadowsare flying off the --

04:44.632 --> 04:46.155
I'm looking for a job
at a private school.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.026
I know you're on the board
of Smith-Moore Academy.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.506
Uhp, uh,
first sign of sunstroke.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.334
She starts talking
about private schools.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.553
Sorry, Deidre.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.468
Sunstroke, with the brim radiuson that visor?

04:54.511 --> 04:56.208
No way.She wants to talk business.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.209
I do.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.820
Servant,
grab your little pencil.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.212
Come take notes.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.736
Actually,
it just so happens,

05:01.779 --> 05:03.433
our school islooking
for a Dean.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.392
You'd be perfect.I could put in a good word.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.132
Really?

05:07.176 --> 05:08.569
Thank you.

05:08.612 --> 05:09.700
Yeah, of course.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.399
And with my pull, the interviewis basically a formality,

05:12.442 --> 05:15.097
so I'll go call the school rightnow while you guys tee off.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.579
That happened
awfully fast.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.929
You are just thrown becauseI made your long game short.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.409
Maybe.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.585
Or she can't afford to lose
her best haircare customer.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.848
Or she just knows thatI'm perfect at everything I do.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.158
Home run!

05:33.202 --> 05:34.595
You're up.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.164
Sorry you couldn't
sit up front.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.731
You have to call shotgun.
Right, Emery?

05:40.775 --> 05:42.385
It's tough for mebecause I'm a pacifist,

05:42.429 --> 05:43.952
but I also get carsick
back there.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.606
Alright, last safe place
for farts.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.172
Blast them out
while you still can.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.392
My dream came a year early.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.471
I clam up.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.733
It comes with age.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.127
What did he mean
by "see you after school"?

06:29.171 --> 06:30.825
You guys don't hang out
atschool?

06:30.868 --> 06:32.479
Oh, it's just that...

06:32.522 --> 06:34.306
I don't want to cramp his style,you know?

06:34.350 --> 06:35.699

06:39.486 --> 06:43.054
Oh, dear Lord,
the tongue kissing is rampant!

06:45.709 --> 06:47.842
Hey, Eve,
nice cat calendar.

06:47.885 --> 06:50.714
Did you see the new "Dilbert"today? So true.

06:50.758 --> 06:53.369
Hey, are we going in ona lotto ticket together or what?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.284
Man, I love
office culture.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.459
Who are you?

06:56.503 --> 06:58.635
I'm the new Dean.
Dean Huang.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.594
I came in last week

07:00.637 --> 07:03.161
for my start paperworkand faculty wall photos?

07:03.205 --> 07:05.729
I deemed myself
a one-shot wonder?

07:05.773 --> 07:08.123
Oh, right.
The Dean.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.864
Principal Reed:
Oh, there she is.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.605
Hello, Jessica.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.259
Principal Reed, what do youneed me to tackle today?

07:14.303 --> 07:16.261
College guidance?
Student discipline?

07:16.305 --> 07:17.611
Slashing the budget?The arts -- gone.

07:17.654 --> 07:21.832
Well, you know, that's not
really...what you're here for.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.704
Uh, between the Headmaster
and myself,

07:23.747 --> 07:24.748
we've got that covered.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.750
Headmaster?
Mm.

07:26.794 --> 07:27.882
Then what do Ido?

07:27.925 --> 07:29.840
Job's pretty much
what you make of it.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.102
So --

07:31.146 --> 07:33.148
Oh, I've got your welcome packethere, and, uh --

07:33.191 --> 07:34.410
Oh, look at that.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.282
I accidentally put in a copy
of Administrator Weekly.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.501
That's weird.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.850
I'm the guest editor.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.504
Oh, well. You enjoy.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.341
Uhp.
Another doorknob.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.516
How was your first day?

07:53.560 --> 07:56.214
Terrible! They only hired me
because I'm Chinese!

07:56.258 --> 07:58.390
What?I'm sure that's not --

08:00.784 --> 08:02.873
"Home of Diversity"?

08:02.917 --> 08:05.006
They have a swimming pool?Can we use --

08:05.049 --> 08:06.050
Not the time.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.579
They put me on the front
of their brochure.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.407
Sure, this face was built
for a cover, but come on!

08:15.451 --> 08:16.670
I knew something was up

08:16.713 --> 08:18.541
when Deidre was so willing
to help you out.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.890
I don't buy  that
much hair product.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.590
Principal Reed couldn't nameone thing in my job description.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.895
I looked it up,

08:24.939 --> 08:28.116
and the title of Dean
didn't even exist until now.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.683
So, then
you're the first.

08:29.726 --> 08:32.120
You likecoming in first.You raced me down the aisle.

08:32.163 --> 08:35.253
The school is obviously caughtup in this new "diversity wave,"

08:35.297 --> 08:37.560
but it's just for optics.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.563
I finally got what I wanted,
and I didn't even earn it.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.044
No, you put in all the work.You deserve this job.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.611
I don't want a handout.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.743
Well, the alternativeis no diversity at all.

08:46.787 --> 08:47.831
Is that better?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.833
That sounds like
my husband talking.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.923
I want to know what
my business consultant thinks.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.447
He -- or me --
he-me --

08:55.491 --> 08:57.624
wethink it's lousyhow you got it, but you got it,

08:57.667 --> 09:00.365
and now you got to make the mostof it and play the long game,

09:00.409 --> 09:01.453
work twice as hard.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.368
I already work
twice as hard.

09:03.412 --> 09:06.720
So now I'm gonna work
fourtimes as hard.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.504
Show them who's Dean.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.855
Oh, I love it when you're angryat people that aren't me.

09:14.858 --> 09:17.295
Uh, I'm still waiting
for my body odor to come in,

09:17.339 --> 09:20.168
but I don't think
that's how you use that.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.518
I realized,why just my armpits?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.825
Where's the lovefor my knee-pits and elbow-pits?

09:24.868 --> 09:26.478
Sure.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.612
Hey, why don't you hang out
with Emery at school?

09:29.656 --> 09:30.613
Emery?

09:30.657 --> 09:32.267
Ah, his drama friendsare weird.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.530
They're always pretendingwith invisible props.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.489
Like, why not just tipyour actual hat?

09:37.533 --> 09:38.969
My crew? We're cool.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.275
With visible props.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.059
Is that why you're always
looking at each other

09:42.103 --> 09:44.975
and saying "Props"?

09:45.019 --> 09:46.063
No.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.282
See, the thing is,

09:47.325 --> 09:49.110
hanging with your brothersat home is fine,

09:49.153 --> 09:51.025
but at school, it's lame.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.114
You gotta do you
at school.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.333
It's technically
"do oneself."

09:55.377 --> 09:56.639
Proving my point.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.511
Look, I've already broken inthe teachers and paved the way.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.688
Emery's gotta figure stuff outon his own.

10:01.731 --> 10:02.819
I'll be gone in a year.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.429
Okay,
but I get the sense

10:04.473 --> 10:06.780
that Emery really wants
to hang out with you.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.043
And remember
what Dad always says?

10:09.086 --> 10:11.523
"Brothers are thicker
than water."

10:11.567 --> 10:13.743
I think it's  "Blood
is thicker than water."

10:13.787 --> 10:15.049
Immigrant parents.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.051
Great at raising kids,
bad at idioms.

10:17.094 --> 10:19.270
It's "Cut me some slacks"all over again.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.621
Okay, I'll throw himan Emery Stick.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.886
Is it weird if I ask youto deodorize my back?

10:25.929 --> 10:26.843
Yes.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.371
And here we are.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.372
Huh?

10:36.984 --> 10:37.941
What's that?

10:37.985 --> 10:39.029
Huh? Wha--

10:39.073 --> 10:40.857
Oh! That's Mr. Buns.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.729
He came from
the 10th-grade science class.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.687
They didn't have it
in their hearts to dissect,

10:44.731 --> 10:46.689
so now he lives here
in the supply closet.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.909
Office.
This is your office.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.127
Okay, fine.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.695
Now that we're here,can we talk through my ideas?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.349
Oh, there's no rush.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.481
Why don't you relax?

10:56.525 --> 11:01.791
Take some time to decorate
and, uh, adjust, huh?

11:01.835 --> 11:03.271
Any other questions?

11:03.314 --> 11:04.881
Just one.

11:04.925 --> 11:08.929
Do you think anyone can hearyour screams from down here?

11:08.972 --> 11:10.278
Aah!

11:10.321 --> 11:12.149
My throat!

11:12.193 --> 11:13.977
You have claws
like a wolf!

11:14.021 --> 11:16.893
Stop bleeding!Take my punches like a man!

11:16.937 --> 11:17.981
Jessica?

11:18.025 --> 11:19.330
Jessica,
any other questions?

11:20.549 --> 11:21.811
No?
Okay, good, good.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.421
Well, you know, I have a meetingin about an hour,

11:23.465 --> 11:26.076
so I better
start the trek back.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.469
Ugh.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.692
You remind me
of one of my exes.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.173
Allof my exes.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.224
Emery, my brother!

11:43.267 --> 11:44.791
Whoa! Eddie.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.010
I know. My voice is getting
deeper, and it is jarring.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.882
It's like, "Is that Batman?"

11:48.925 --> 11:50.448
No, it's me. Eddie.

11:50.492 --> 11:51.798
No, we're pretendingto be in a band,

11:51.841 --> 11:53.930
and you totally justmade a ruckus on the piano.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.150
Oh.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.934
Invisible prop time.
Fun.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.677
So, I was thinking
maybe I'd hang out

12:01.721 --> 12:03.244
with my favorite
middle brother today.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.463
Nah, we're good.
Thanks.

12:05.507 --> 12:08.031
What? Emery, come on.
This is a gift from God.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.641
Like the day
Cinemax was unscrambled.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.861
I appreciate the offer,but I'd rather you not join.

12:11.905 --> 12:12.862
No offense.

12:12.906 --> 12:13.950
Yesoffense.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.778
You should be thrilled
your older, cooler brother

12:15.822 --> 12:16.823
is sitting with you.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.868
It's just that we're kindain the middle of something here.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.829
I get it. You don't know
how to shake these dweebs.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.875
Dweebs?
Have you seen yourfriends?

12:25.919 --> 12:28.138
Or should I say,
the Tall Freak Parade?

12:28.182 --> 12:31.054
Tall Freak Parade?
What about Brian?

12:31.098 --> 12:32.795
You're using Brian tomake yourself seem normal? Sad.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.405
You know what? Good.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.712
I don't wanna hang out with
my brother at school anyways.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.800
Nothing lamer than that.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.678
Pretty clean game so far.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.071
They haven'tshown the referee once.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.812
I can't do it anymore.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.075
I've been trying to work
four times as hard,

12:52.119 --> 12:53.947
but it is 10 times as hard
to work four times as hard.

12:53.990 --> 12:56.645
I know it's not easy,but you gotta hang in there.

12:56.688 --> 12:57.864
They won't let me.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.866
I tried to pitch in
at a staff meeting.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.519
Half the staff thinks
I'm only there

13:01.563 --> 13:03.217
to "increase diversity,"

13:03.260 --> 13:04.871
and they don't even
listen to me.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.656
A part of our budget
has been set aside

13:07.699 --> 13:10.659
to update our teams' uniforms
with our new mascot --

13:10.702 --> 13:12.095
the Ghosts.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.096
Great idea.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.184
What a beautiful tribute

13:14.228 --> 13:16.012
to the graveyardthe school's built on.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.101
Jessica:
You know what else is scary?

13:18.145 --> 13:19.842
Our school nutrition.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.453
I was thinking we could use
some of the budget

13:22.497 --> 13:23.846
for healthy vending machines.

13:26.893 --> 13:27.676
Ooh!

13:27.719 --> 13:29.112
Off that, I wonder

13:29.156 --> 13:32.942
if we should consider putting inhealthy vending machines.

13:32.986 --> 13:33.987
Just spitballing.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.858
What an interesting idea,
Jan.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.339
Thank you, Jan.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.688
My goodness!

13:39.731 --> 13:41.908
Excellent work, Jan.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.910
Okay, not great.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.259
But maybeit's because you're new.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.087
You have toestablish yourself first.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.916
I thought that, too,so I tried to distinguish myself

13:49.959 --> 13:52.135
as something other than
"the Asian person."

13:52.179 --> 13:54.485
Find something else
for them to focus on.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.313
Alright, Mr. Buns,
here's the plan.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.924
We'll walk into
the admin building,

13:57.967 --> 14:00.143
you'll distract everyone
with your cuteness,

14:00.187 --> 14:01.666
and then I'll hit them
with my plan

14:01.710 --> 14:04.104
to start college guidance
in the 7th grade.

14:04.147 --> 14:07.368
Oh! Do you have a bunny becauseit's the year of the rabbit?

14:09.718 --> 14:11.241
It makes no sense.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.461
I know it's about optics,but they're still paying you.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.115
You'd think they'd wantto use you for something.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.333
Oh, they do.

14:16.377 --> 14:21.034
Alright, any ideas
for Hispanic Heritage Month?

14:21.077 --> 14:24.124
What if the cafeteriaserves tacos?

14:24.167 --> 14:26.169
Is that okay?
Culturally?

14:29.433 --> 14:31.305
The only reason
they want me there

14:31.348 --> 14:34.047
is to sign off
on anything "diverse."

14:34.090 --> 14:35.178
To protect themselves.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.397
Wow. That's...

14:36.440 --> 14:37.920
Wow.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.313
I know what
you're going to say.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.402
"As your business consultant,
stick it out,

14:41.445 --> 14:43.752
play the long game,
stop eating my Slim Jims."

14:43.795 --> 14:46.407
No. I say screw them,they don't deserve you.

14:46.450 --> 14:47.538
You gotta quit.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.414
You want me to quit?

14:53.457 --> 14:54.937
What about
the long game?

14:54.981 --> 14:56.591
Ah, it's just an expressionI picked to build you up.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.027
I could've gone
with any of them --

14:58.071 --> 14:59.289
"It's always real darkbefore dawn,"

14:59.333 --> 15:01.161
"Every cloudhas a shiny coating,"

15:01.204 --> 15:02.640
"Rome took a while."

15:02.684 --> 15:04.338
"When one door closes,
a window opens."

15:04.381 --> 15:05.643
You need to look
for another school,

15:05.687 --> 15:07.210
where your talentswill be appreciated.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.516
It's pointless.

15:08.559 --> 15:11.519
I researched
some other private schools.

15:11.562 --> 15:12.955
It's more of the same.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.610
This one says"Now with black teachers."

15:15.653 --> 15:17.177
Alright,
so, what's your advice?

15:18.221 --> 15:19.440
None. You can't win.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.963
I have no Louis Pep Talkfor this.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.835
They've got you. You're stuckbetween a rock and a hard face.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.750
Well, what happened
to Business Louis?

15:25.794 --> 15:28.231
Brutally honest,
straightforward, no emotion.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.232
He's dead.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.668
It kills me
to see you lose.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.019
I have no answers for you.It's all so disheartening.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.287
Hey,
want some Emery Sticks?

15:41.679 --> 15:44.073
Did you bring the trash canover here just for that?

15:44.117 --> 15:45.466
Worth it.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.555
Hey, my brothers who aredefinitely not mad at each other

15:47.598 --> 15:48.599
or mad at me.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.036
Evan, watch out!

15:50.079 --> 15:51.559
Emery's imaginary drum kitis there.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.126
You don't want
to cause a ruckus.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.084
You're the one who tried
to crash my lunch table.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.043
Because I felt bad
for you.

15:57.086 --> 15:59.393
I didn't want to sit with you,but Evan said you wanted me to.

15:59.436 --> 16:00.437
I never said that.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.136
You said you didn't want
to hang out with Eddie

16:03.179 --> 16:04.615
because you didn't want
to cramp his style.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.182
I only said that
because I didn't want to admit

16:06.226 --> 16:08.010
I don't want to hang out
with Eddie at school.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.098
Harsh.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.795
But I get it. Same.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.146
I'm just bummed that you guys
don't hang out at high school.

16:13.189 --> 16:16.105
I know it's different,
but I didn't expect it
to be thatdifferent.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.238
Just wait 'til you goto a high school locker room.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.370
Wall-to-wall butts.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.459
We only have one year
left with Eddie.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.113
We shouldn't squander it.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.289
Brothers should hang out
whenever they can.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.250
Wow. He just
doesn't get it.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.252
Maybe we should give himwhat he wants.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.731
Some quality brother time.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.867
Peace offering?

16:38.910 --> 16:41.087
I know it's symbolic because
it was in the trash, but --

16:42.088 --> 16:43.176
Mm.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.612
It's got some trash OJon it,

16:44.655 --> 16:46.614
but it gives it
a nice tang.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.181
Mm.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.967
Well, I guess
I should ask you,

16:52.011 --> 16:53.534
since you're
my only responsibility.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.231
Should I quit?

16:56.232 --> 16:58.669
But if I kill him,
I have to kill everybody.

16:58.713 --> 16:59.453
Jessica?

16:59.496 --> 17:00.758
We need you.

17:00.802 --> 17:03.196
Our ghost mascotblew up in our face.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.198
When the marching band threwtheir sheets over themselves,

17:05.241 --> 17:06.112
that was bad enough,

17:06.155 --> 17:08.244
but when they salutedour veterans in the stands...

17:08.288 --> 17:10.203
ugh, not a good look.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.639
Very KKK.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.294
And I don't mean Spanishfor "What? What? What?"

17:14.337 --> 17:16.209
Mm.
So, nowyou need me.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.123
Yes.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.733
Any ideas?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.913
This schoolhas two Indian guys.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.871
And I looked it up.One died 30 years ago.

17:26.915 --> 17:27.959
Horrific car accident.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.352
But they're still
using his photo!

17:29.396 --> 17:31.354
Louis, burn those.
I'm not quitting.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.009
What? But you said yourselfit's pointless.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.577
I did. Because
it rattled my confidence.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.101
But I know who I am
and what I can offer.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.798
If they don't want to listen,
that's on them.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.974
But if I quit,
that's on me.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.977
My business consultant
was right all along.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.327
I have to play
the long game.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.329
I have to have
a seat at the table

17:49.372 --> 17:51.983
so this doesn't happen
to other people in the future.

17:52.027 --> 17:55.117
'Cause chances are, they're only1/4 as strong as me. Tops.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.337
That can be
a really long game.

17:57.380 --> 18:00.122
But I've got my husband
and business consultant

18:00.166 --> 18:01.819
by my side, right?

18:01.863 --> 18:03.343
Always.
Good.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.345
Get your things,
because it's happening today.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.216
I called a press conference,
and I need your help.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.348
I gotta hand it to you,Jessica,

18:08.391 --> 18:10.132
you really speed up
the long game.

18:13.527 --> 18:14.615
So, he says,

18:14.658 --> 18:16.399
"That's no quadratic equation.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.574
That's my wife!"

18:18.662 --> 18:20.490
Ha ha ha ha.Ha ha ha ha.

18:20.534 --> 18:21.839
Ahhh.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.232
What are you guys
doing here?

18:23.276 --> 18:25.408
You said the math teamdesperately needed members.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.715
Plus, brothers are
thicker than water!

18:27.758 --> 18:30.152
So, we're here to hang,all at school,

18:30.196 --> 18:32.023
just like you wanted.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.809
But this is kinda my thing.

18:34.852 --> 18:38.291
Okay, Mathletes, who's ready
to divideand conquer?

18:41.076 --> 18:43.296
What is the least common
multiple of 4 and 10?

18:43.339 --> 18:44.601
Pi.

18:44.645 --> 18:45.733
Wrong.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.300
Damn Emery's
quick pointer finger!

18:47.343 --> 18:48.736
Next question --

18:48.779 --> 18:52.305
Today, Amy's age
is four times Jon's age.

18:52.348 --> 18:55.090
Three years ago,
the sum of their ages was 54.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.310
How old is Amy today?

18:57.353 --> 18:58.311
Pi.Who Amy?

18:58.354 --> 18:59.181
Wrong.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.791
This next one's
an easy one.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.793
Solve this equation --

19:02.837 --> 19:05.187
E = MC blank.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.407
Hammer! MC Hammer.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.626
Wrong. Very wrong.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.846
I'd like to take
a 2.24 squared.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.587
Pi?

19:13.630 --> 19:14.892
A five!

19:18.722 --> 19:20.333
Okay, I get it.Eddie: See, Evan?

19:20.376 --> 19:22.204
Having your brothers
up in your business at school

19:22.248 --> 19:23.205
isn't always fun.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.859
You love Grandma, right?

19:24.902 --> 19:27.340
Does the horizontal asymptote
of "Y equals zero"

19:27.383 --> 19:28.819
extend to infinity?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.561
It does.
I love Grandma.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.433
Do you want to spend
all your time with her?

19:33.476 --> 19:35.783
Even when she's sorting her brasout by their mileage?

19:35.826 --> 19:36.784
No.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.829
I once had to do
the thongs.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.441
I guess I do have a lot to learnabout high school.

19:41.484 --> 19:42.355
I just got it!

19:42.398 --> 19:43.356
Mathlete!

19:43.399 --> 19:45.358
Like athlete,
but with math.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.707
People are so creative.

19:46.750 --> 19:47.708
Mm.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.494
The school administration

19:51.538 --> 19:54.367
thought that ghosts were
"culturally neutral"

19:54.410 --> 19:56.282
since "everybody dies,"

19:56.325 --> 19:58.284
but as long as I am Dean,

19:58.327 --> 20:02.331
I ensure the school will never
make a mistake like this again.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.683
And now
it's time for questions.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.294
Keep it quick.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.296
I know you have other
private-school press
conferences to attend.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.514
Questions? Uh...

20:13.560 --> 20:16.519
Oh, yes, you, handsome man
in the Western blazer.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.608
Uh, Dean Jessica Huang,
with your new position,

20:18.652 --> 20:20.480
what plans do you have
for the school?

20:20.523 --> 20:22.917
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, random reporter.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.963
Let me walk you through
my extensive list of plans

20:26.007 --> 20:28.270
that fall under
my job description,

20:28.314 --> 20:29.837
none of which
can be taken away

20:29.880 --> 20:32.448
because I'm listing them here
publicly today.

20:32.492 --> 20:35.103
Well, at least I'll finally
find out what a Dean does.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.278
Long game.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.672
After that, we'll discuss
the generous raise

20:38.715 --> 20:40.413
that will be offered to me
tomorrow.

20:40.456 --> 20:41.283
Raise?

20:41.327 --> 20:42.763
And, uh, after-hours use
of the pool?

20:42.806 --> 20:44.068
No more questions.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.294
Wait, so there's
a pizza pie,

20:52.338 --> 20:54.296
a fruit pie,
anda math pi?

20:54.340 --> 20:56.124
I know, I know,
it's a lot.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.473
Why'd they run out of words?

20:57.517 --> 20:58.779
Wait, then what pie
are they talking about

20:58.822 --> 20:59.997
when they say
"pie in the sky"?

21:00.041 --> 21:01.172
Mm,that's not the phrase.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.523
It's "pie in this guy."
Like in here.

21:03.566 --> 21:06.352
That makes sense,
because you eat it.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.179
But you don't eat
the math pi.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.007
Oh.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.923
Everybody,
meet Mr. Buns.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.578
He is my assistant,
and he will be staying with us

21:15.622 --> 21:19.408
while Principal Reed makes sure
they put a window in my office.

21:19.452 --> 21:22.150
I was afraid to ask who Mr. Bunswas this entire time,

21:22.193 --> 21:24.544
and let me tell you,
I'm relieved.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.372
Aww, he's so cute.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.025
Think that's a good idea.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.375
Hmm.
