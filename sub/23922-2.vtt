01:37.165 --> 01:40.868
The S&P 500
has soared nearly 270%.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.736
This week,
the Federal Reserve will be

01:42.770 --> 01:45.739
a prime focus for investors.
Policymakers are not...

01:45.773 --> 01:48.409
Iran has been
bullying their neighbors.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.786
They've been destabilizing
the region. They're basic...

01:50.811 --> 01:53.247
Side effects
may include nausea, c...

01:53.281 --> 01:54.858
When asked about the
tweet, White House officials

01:54.882 --> 01:56.584
insisted the president
was joking, saying,

01:56.617 --> 01:58.286
"Mermaids do not exist.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.388
Therefore, Trump's reference
to talking with one..."

02:00.421 --> 02:02.623
Meanwhile,
North Korean leader Kim Jong...

02:02.656 --> 02:03.757
The body you...

02:03.791 --> 02:06.260
Dan Oxenbold,
a partner at the law firm

02:06.294 --> 02:07.895
Oxenbold and Jensen...
Got it!

02:07.928 --> 02:09.506
Was murdered today
on the streets...
Found it, Diane.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.574
Of downtown Chicago.
It's true?

02:10.598 --> 02:11.565
Looks like it.
The gunman

02:11.599 --> 02:12.566
was taken into custody

02:12.600 --> 02:13.801
30 this morning,

02:13.834 --> 02:15.636
after he was caught on camera
in what police

02:15.669 --> 02:18.339
called a targeted killing
in broad daylight.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.941
It was crazy!
I was just on my way to work.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.676
I was walking down the street,
and some guy

02:22.710 --> 02:24.612
came out of nowhere
and shot him.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.323
The next thing I knew,
he was down...
Oh, my God.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.591
On the ground
and everyone starts running.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.917
Complete chaos.
Again?

02:29.950 --> 02:31.452
Just today.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.886
Well, did they find him?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.655
Randy Fox
recently declared bankruptcy

02:34.688 --> 02:36.624
after losing a hearing
over a patent dispute,

02:36.657 --> 02:38.226
a loss he blamed on his lawyer.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.927
Dear God, it's like a plague.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.396
This appears to be a copycat
of the hit-and-run killing

02:42.430 --> 02:45.299
of Chicago attorney Roger Hill
two weeks ago.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.601
According to police documents,
the suspect

02:47.635 --> 02:49.970
in that case, Stan Greennoble,
now in custody,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.848
was angry about overbilling...
We'll discuss this

02:51.872 --> 02:54.375
in the staff meeting.
Writing "Kill all lawyers"

02:54.408 --> 02:55.785
before running down
the much-loved lawyer.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.279
Kill all lawyers! All of 'em!

02:58.312 --> 02:59.847
Kill 'em! All of 'em! Kill 'em!

02:59.880 --> 03:02.850
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

03:02.883 --> 03:07.555
And I hope to contribute
to the legacy of my father.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.625
Thank you, Liz.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.794
Today is a new day right here.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.372
We're still getting some things
in place.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.531
Um, you'll notice some walls
need painting.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.501
Some chairs are missing. We
just opened up the 22nd floor,

03:20.534 --> 03:25.306
so you'll probably see some
cranky associates down there.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.477
We're growing.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.479
Yes.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.758
Don't you think we should have
a moment of silence

03:34.782 --> 03:36.584
for Dan Oxenbold?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.586
Right.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.289
I don't know how many
of you knew Dan.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.690
He was shot down yesterday.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.658
So let's just offer
a moment here.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.306
Good.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.573
Rest in peace, Dan.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.975
One bit of new business.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.412
We may find that
some older clients drift away

04:04.445 --> 04:06.480
due to the loss of Carl.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.991
Maybe you could talk
to Carl's clients?

04:08.015 --> 04:09.450
Oh, sure, sure.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.585
What about
Dan Oxenbold's clients?

04:11.619 --> 04:14.355
What about 'em?
They don't have

04:14.388 --> 04:15.556
a lawyer anymore.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.057
Why aren't we going after them?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.459
I'm not sure we're ready...

04:18.492 --> 04:19.560
It's a little harsh,

04:19.593 --> 04:21.028
don't you think?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.039
Can't we at least wait
until after the funeral?
Yeah, sure,

04:23.063 --> 04:24.865
if we want to lose them
to someone else.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.402
He has one client that's not
gonna go long without a lawyer.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.003
Who?

04:30.037 --> 04:30.971
Joe Swoboda.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.373
Heating oil business.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.875
$133 million in assets.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.511
Why isn't he gonna go long
without a lawyer?

04:39.112 --> 04:42.616
"Given that I used to work
for the Department of Justice,

04:42.650 --> 04:44.552
there is certain information
I cannot divulge."

04:44.585 --> 04:45.886
But there's a case

04:45.919 --> 04:48.656
building against him?
Again,

04:48.689 --> 04:50.824
given my previous job,

04:50.858 --> 04:52.393
I cannot divulge information

04:52.426 --> 04:54.070
that would subject me
to a disbarment hearing.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.664
And yet you would advise
soliciting this client,

04:56.697 --> 04:59.299
because he will soon have
an increase in billable hours?

05:00.701 --> 05:02.570
Yes.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.338
Okay.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.073
I'll give him a call.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.675
Why don't we have Liz do it?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.912
Great.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.449
Not bad.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.451
At least you have a desk.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.787
So, what do you need?

05:22.055 --> 05:23.857
Maia Rindell.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.694
Okay.
Her prosecution

05:26.727 --> 05:28.429
starts today.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.498
Right now, in fact.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.667
You used to be the prosecutor,
so I know you can't mention

05:33.701 --> 05:36.069
any specifics, but Maia Rindell

05:36.103 --> 05:39.006
is my goddaughter, and I just...

05:39.039 --> 05:42.710
I just wanted to know...

05:42.743 --> 05:45.513
what to think about her case.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.715
You know the difference
between this office

05:47.748 --> 05:49.417
and the U.S. Attorney's Office?

05:49.450 --> 05:50.751
No.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.085
We have walls.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.487
Actual...

06:01.895 --> 06:06.066
Okay, I, uh... I developed
the strategy on that case,

06:06.099 --> 06:07.601
and it is tough.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.136
It's a slam dunk.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.638
I'm sorry,

06:10.671 --> 06:11.981
but they know
she's a little fish.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.049
They're just going after her

06:13.073 --> 06:14.475
so they can get to her father.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.519
Maia doesn't know
where Henry is.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.810
They don't believe her.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.613
Look, if I were her,
I'd plead out.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.782
She might get one year.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.819
I don't think she can do that.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.955
Well, then I'd reject

06:27.988 --> 06:30.491
the prosecution's motion
for continuance.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.125
Colin Morrello got all
of my cases

06:32.159 --> 06:33.627
dumped on him.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.929
Force him to fight now, and...

06:35.963 --> 06:38.165
he may stumble.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.734
Thanks.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.572
I didn't say anything.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.878
The prosecution
is holding back a witness.

06:50.911 --> 06:55.148
A surprise witness that
will devastate Maia's case.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.885
I don't imagine
you can say who that is.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.654
Sorry.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.864
Uh, one second, Your Honor.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.065
What?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.734
Fight the continuance.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.202
Why? We're not ready.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.538
They're not readier.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.940
How do we know that?

07:19.973 --> 07:22.876
I can't say.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.680
Uh, Your Honor,

07:26.714 --> 07:29.249
this is the third continuance
requested by the prosecution.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.185
At a certain point,
we need to go to trial.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.797
We're ready.
We've been ready for a while.

07:33.821 --> 07:37.124
Uh, I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but this is not my case.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.726
Liz Reddick retired,
and I inherited

07:38.759 --> 07:39.769
her caseload...
Oh, wait a minute.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.761
She didn't retire.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.930
She was fired by Donald Trump.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.233
What? She
was not f... No,

07:46.266 --> 07:48.936
this has nothing to do with
Donald Trump, uh, Your Honor.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.138
Liz Reddick chose to resign.
She didn't...

07:51.171 --> 07:53.507
Before Donald Trump
could fire her.
Oh, please, Lucca,

07:53.541 --> 07:55.943
will you stop playing
the judge's politics?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.153
I'm not playing anything, Colin.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.755
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Stop.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.914
Were you two fighting
in my court a year ago?

08:00.948 --> 08:02.215
What? No.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.984
This court? I'm not s...
I am not going

08:04.017 --> 08:05.853
to spend the next few days

08:05.886 --> 08:07.855
listening to you two screaming
at each other.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.857
Uh, shake hands.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.892
The world is angry enough
without you two

08:11.925 --> 08:12.993
bringing it in here.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.828
Go ahead.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.567
Good.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.769
N-Now look each other
in the eye.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.103
We're all professionals in here.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.905
In fact, let's say that.
"I respect you..."

08:24.938 --> 08:27.074
I respect you and
we're all professionals in here.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.076
Good. Now let's live it.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.111
Now, regarding your motion,
this is, in fact,

08:32.145 --> 08:33.813
your third continuance,
Counselor.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.015
And as much as I have issues

08:36.049 --> 08:38.986
with our current...
reality star president,

08:39.019 --> 08:40.953
I overrule your motion
purely on the grounds

08:40.988 --> 08:43.023
of the speediness of justice.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.894
I hope whoever's texting you
knows what they're doing.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.297
Your Honor, I share your concern
about our president,

08:50.330 --> 08:52.633
and especially about the
nepotism of Ivanka and Jared.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.101
Mm.
It's upsetting

08:54.134 --> 08:57.237
how they get around the usual
rules regarding nepotism.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.706
That's why I move

08:58.739 --> 08:59.983
that Reddick/Boseman be excluded

09:00.007 --> 09:01.184
from representing Maia Rindell.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.710
What?!
Ah!

09:02.743 --> 09:04.077
Ah-ah-ah. No.
We just shook hands.

09:04.111 --> 09:07.080
If I could finish?
Liz Reddick used to be
the prosecutor on this case,

09:07.114 --> 09:08.692
and now she works at their firm.
Your Honor,

09:08.716 --> 09:10.026
there is a Chinese wall
at a firm...

09:10.050 --> 09:12.252
Yes, like the Chinese wall
at the White House.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.963
And how effective
do you think that is?
Your Honor,

09:13.987 --> 09:15.164
there is no connection
between the issues

09:15.188 --> 09:16.690
at the White House
and this case.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.067
You just said there was.
With the firing

09:18.091 --> 09:20.193
of Liz Reddick,
not with the rest of it.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.195
Okay, thank you.
I just, I just...

09:22.229 --> 09:24.197
Oh, my God.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.066
This world.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.736
Um, sorry.
Uh, Ms. Quinn

09:28.769 --> 09:30.013
has been on the case
since the beginning,

09:30.037 --> 09:31.705
far predating
Mrs. Reddick's

09:31.739 --> 09:33.641
move to her firm.
On top of that,

09:33.674 --> 09:34.975
the defendant does have

09:35.008 --> 09:36.385
a Sixth Amendment right
to choice of counsel.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.245
So, again, I
overrule the motion.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.782
Okay, can we get started now?

09:41.815 --> 09:45.619
Or do we want to fight
about what to eat for lunch?

09:45.653 --> 09:47.988
He was a good man.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.790
What?

09:49.823 --> 09:52.860
Your lawyer! He was a good man.

09:52.893 --> 09:53.994
Oh. Yeah.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.195
I didn't shoot him.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.765
Oh. I didn't think you did.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.833
I mean, we argued.
I don't like to be overbilled.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.336
We don't overbill, sir.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.205
Ah.
Uh, do you know

10:05.238 --> 10:07.207
Liz Reddick from the
Department of Justice?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.142
She just joined us.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.044
Uh, she just joined us!

10:11.078 --> 10:14.047
Ah!
Mr. Swoboda, I-I'm so sorry
about your lawyer.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.116
It's a bad time
to be without one.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.851
Am I being indicted?

10:19.753 --> 10:22.656
Well, obviously, Liz can't share
any of that information.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.825
But it would be a good time
to have a lawyer.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.094
And you're the best
one to help me?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.662
Oh, without a doubt.
Why is that?

10:28.696 --> 10:31.364
I mean, you can't use anything
you know about the case.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.166
Right? You got to
sit on your hands.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.302
Yeah, but here's-here's
what I can do.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.904
I know how the other side works

10:36.937 --> 10:39.206
and how they think.
I know what

10:39.239 --> 10:40.307
their pressure points are.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.875
I know how to fuck with them.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.343
Okay.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.878
But here's my problem.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.714
You got competition here. Hey!

10:46.747 --> 10:49.382
You! Other lawyer,
over here.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.184
Liz.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.954
Tim.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.689
What are you doing here, Tim?

10:55.723 --> 10:57.891
You think you're
the only ex-prosecutor looking

10:57.925 --> 11:01.094
for clients?
That's funny, 'cause I
distinctly remember you saying

11:01.128 --> 11:03.764
you were going to work for the
Southern Poverty Law Center.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.866
Changed my mind.
You wouldn't be
here peddling

11:05.899 --> 11:08.836
information about grand jury
proceedings, would you?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.439
Your competition?

11:12.472 --> 11:15.375
Yep. Tim Shefflin.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.878
Piece of shit,
but he's a good lawyer.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.246
That's okay.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.248
Sharpens the mind.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.122
Of course.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.124
I can take the next one.
No, no, no.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.136
These elevators take forever.
You'll be here till Thursday.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.461
Come on.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.012
So how personal is this?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.281
Excuse me?
Your prosecution.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.884
How much is it about us?

11:56.917 --> 11:59.219
That's right.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.122
I've been crying myself to sleep
ever since we broke up.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.033
Anybody else
and you'd be plea bargaining.
Anybody else

12:04.057 --> 12:06.393
and you'd have your client
tell us where Henry is.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.330
So, are you fucking her?

12:10.363 --> 12:12.065
Okay.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.935
She looks at you
with these big Thumper eyes.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.337
Jealous?
Not the first word
that springs to mind.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.506
See you in court, Counselor.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.374
What was that about?

12:21.408 --> 12:24.111
Just some trash-talking.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.415
They have a surprise witness.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.484
And we know this
from your secret texter?
Mm-hmm.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.353
Is it Liz Reddick?

12:33.386 --> 12:35.956
I can't say.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.425
Who's the witness?
They don't know.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.227
Well, then they're
not much help, are they?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.262
Let's focus.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.105
How long have you been a teacher
at Lake Forest, Ms. Heinberg?

12:52.139 --> 12:53.540
25 years.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.976
And how did you come to invest
in the Rindell Fund?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.878
It was through Maia.

12:57.911 --> 13:01.181
She was a student in
my sociology class.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.516
I remember one day
the topic was...

13:03.550 --> 13:06.219
income inequality,
and she suggested

13:06.253 --> 13:10.190
that I invest with her father.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.425
I feel like such a fool.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.895
Did Maia ever apologize to you,

13:14.928 --> 13:16.529
show any remorse?

13:16.563 --> 13:19.566
No. Not a word.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.202
No further questions,
Your Honor.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.204
Hi.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.006
Hi.
My mother

13:26.039 --> 13:27.407
was a teacher, actually.
Oh.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.309
So I remember how hard...
Objection.

13:29.342 --> 13:33.213
As fascinating as Ms. Quinn's
biography is, relevance.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.048
Sustained, but the tone there?

13:35.082 --> 13:37.350
Just on the edge, Counselor.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.162
My apologies, Your Honor.
Is there any compensation

13:39.186 --> 13:41.421
to your job other than money,

13:41.454 --> 13:43.490
Ms. Heinberg

13:43.523 --> 13:47.227
Are there other ways
you are paid?
Yes.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.364
The joy of seeing a young mind
grasp a new concept.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.100
And what about
the free Botox treatments?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.868
O-Objection.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.937
Uh, relevance.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.371
It goes to credibility,
Your Honor.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.174
Well, I'm intrigued how we get
from teaching to Botox,

14:01.208 --> 14:04.277
so, uh, cautiously overruled.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.946
You did receive
free Botox treatments

14:05.979 --> 14:07.891
from the mother of a student
who was a dermatologist,

14:07.915 --> 14:09.016
did you not?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.259
She offered it.
And did you receive

14:10.283 --> 14:12.152
gifts from other parents,
as well?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.286
Objection. Vague.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.388
Then let me clarify.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.990
Did you receive...

14:17.024 --> 14:20.060
season tickets to the symphony,

14:20.093 --> 14:23.096
an apartment in London
for the month of July,

14:23.130 --> 14:24.965
a guesthouse
on Martha's Vineyard

14:24.998 --> 14:26.366
for the month of August...?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.568
Some parents
are deeply appreciative

14:28.601 --> 14:30.270
of the learning environment.
Right.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.240
So appreciative that
they swore out these affidavits.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.541
Here you go.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.143
Affidavits stating

14:36.176 --> 14:38.278
that they felt pressured by you

14:38.311 --> 14:40.180
to offer these gifts.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.548
That it was a quid pro quo

14:41.581 --> 14:43.951
for your glowing letters
of recommendation.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.552
That's not true,
and I'm deeply offended

14:45.585 --> 14:46.987
by the implication.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.297
I don't think I'm implying
anything, ma'am;

14:48.321 --> 14:50.123
I'm asking questions.

14:50.157 --> 14:53.060
And now I'm done.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.294
Do I get to defend myself?

14:54.327 --> 14:57.097
No. That's not how this works.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.532
She gets to defend
herself. You...

14:59.566 --> 15:02.569
are excused, ma'am.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.007
Call Amy Breslin

15:07.040 --> 15:08.541
to the stand.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.719
The surprise witness?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.354
I think so.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.456
What will she say?

15:55.222 --> 15:58.425
They just sprang
the surprise witness on us.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.993
No.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.663
How do you know?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.474
Because the surprise witness
couldn't possibly

16:05.498 --> 16:07.034
be on the stand right now.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.668
Why not?

16:08.701 --> 16:12.672
Because
the surprise witness is...

16:26.319 --> 16:28.421
You and Maia Rindell
have lived together

16:28.455 --> 16:30.790
for, uh...

16:30.823 --> 16:32.492
was it three?

16:32.525 --> 16:35.128
What is it, four years?

16:35.162 --> 16:36.796
Yes.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.133
Is it fair to say
that you two are in love?

16:40.167 --> 16:42.802
I think it is.

16:42.835 --> 16:47.107
And you live in a
2,000-square-foot apartment

16:47.140 --> 16:48.741
on Lake Shore Drive

16:48.775 --> 16:53.446
with a rent of...

16:53.480 --> 16:56.349
You have that? Uh...
Yeah.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.118
No, I-I-I've got it.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.253
Uh, is that right?
Yeah.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.655
Oh, wow. $4,500 a month?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.624
Uh, we used to live there.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.759
We don't anymore.
Oh.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.395
Well, that's too
bad. Sounds nice.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.297
Is there a reason for the move?

17:10.329 --> 17:12.098
We can't afford it.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.608
Because Maia's parents
were paying most of the rent?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.768
We will stipulate
that Maia's parents paid 80%

17:15.801 --> 17:18.605
of the rent
while she was at law school

17:18.637 --> 17:20.173
Thank you,

17:20.207 --> 17:21.840
Ms. Quinn.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.311
And you went on vacations

17:25.345 --> 17:27.214
with the Rindell
family twice a year?

17:27.247 --> 17:29.782
Spain in the spring of 2016.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.518
Italy in December.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.187
We will stipulate that
they also went on vacations.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.123
Why don't you let me
ask my questions?

17:36.156 --> 17:38.158
Okay, wait. Cooler heads.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.694
Why are we on this tour
of their lives, Mr. Morrello?

17:41.728 --> 17:46.799
Well, Maia was receiving
$300,000 a year

17:46.833 --> 17:48.168
of her parents' money.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.871
Money for vacations, cars,

17:51.904 --> 17:53.306
luxury apartments.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.108
And all of this money
was stolen directly

17:55.142 --> 17:57.444
from middle-class people
like Ms. Heinberg.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.112
Yeah, go ahead.
You can proceed.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.480
Did your father

18:00.513 --> 18:02.582
want to invest
in the Rindell Fund, Amy?

18:02.615 --> 18:05.318
Yes.
And was he allowed to do so?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.690
No.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.792
He wanted to cash in his IRA

18:12.825 --> 18:15.162
and invest...

18:15.195 --> 18:18.131
$140,000

18:18.165 --> 18:19.666
in the Rindell Fund,

18:19.699 --> 18:22.635
but you were told by Maia that
that wasn't enough?

18:22.669 --> 18:25.805
Yes.
Even though her
high school teacher

18:25.838 --> 18:27.750
was allowed in the fund
for less than half that amount?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.809
Objection.
Is Mr. Morrello testifying?

18:29.842 --> 18:31.178
Yeah, uh, sustained.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.414
Amy, is it possible

18:34.447 --> 18:37.884
that Maia was
protecting your dad

18:37.917 --> 18:40.187
by warning him off the fund?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.288
Objection. Speculative.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.689
I'll rephrase.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.925
After Maia turned down
your father's money,

18:45.958 --> 18:48.728
did you ask Maia

18:48.761 --> 18:51.764
if something was wrong
with the fund?

18:57.304 --> 18:59.706
Y-Yes.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.442
And what did she say?

19:04.211 --> 19:06.613
Maia didn't say anything.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.286
Sh-She nodded.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.889
Meaning there was
something wrong with the fund?

19:16.923 --> 19:19.392
That's how I understood it.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.261
Thank you,

19:21.294 --> 19:23.230
Ms. Breslin,

19:23.263 --> 19:25.198
for your honesty.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.900
Oh, uh, one more question.

19:27.934 --> 19:31.838
Did you and Maia
ever discuss marriage?

19:33.873 --> 19:36.343
Um...

19:36.376 --> 19:39.212
Would you like me to
repeat the question?
Uh, no.

19:39.246 --> 19:42.282
Uh, yes, we discussed marriage.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.816
Who proposed to whom?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.253
Maia proposed to me.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.730
Had the indictments
already been issued

19:47.754 --> 19:49.222
for her family at that time?

19:49.256 --> 19:51.391
Objection. Relevance.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.692
It seems relevant to me.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.661
The prosecutor is
suggesting that marriage

19:54.694 --> 19:57.464
was proposed to keep
Ms. Breslin from testifying.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.765
Spousal privilege.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.300
Uh, uh, yes.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.002
The indictments
had already been issued.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.639
And you turned
down the proposal?

20:08.341 --> 20:09.742
I did.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.544
Why?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.546
Uh, it...

20:13.580 --> 20:15.815
it's complicated.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.450
Were you worried

20:17.484 --> 20:21.321
that Maia had an ulterior motive
for proposing?

20:29.796 --> 20:32.499
I don't know.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.646
I should testify.
No.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.281
That's what they want.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.549
They'll kill you.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.419
I think they already killed me.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.022
You could take the one year.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.626
No, I can't.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.361
I was already in there
for two weeks.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.996
I know, but five years, Maia?

21:04.030 --> 21:05.832
They have a good case.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.634
Ah, you're back. Good.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.369
Let me show you
to your new office.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.038
I know where it is.
No, it got moved.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.374
You think
we have a copycat situation

21:14.407 --> 21:16.743
where clients will start
threatening their attorneys?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.578
I think it's a version
of the old lawyer joke.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.448
How do you save a lawyer
from drowning?

21:21.481 --> 21:23.716
You take your foot off his head.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.820
Seriously, though,

21:27.854 --> 21:29.389
how much of a problem is this?

21:29.422 --> 21:31.358
Obviously, any time someone

21:31.391 --> 21:32.892
resorts to violence,
it's a problem.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.094
But lawyers in particular...

21:35.127 --> 21:37.597
You're coming with me.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.599
I'm coming with you?
To drink.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.000
And I will not be denied.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.002
I need to know
what this place is all about.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.073
Um, give me ten minutes.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.008
There's also some of that
brought on...
Okay.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.977
By the lawyers themselves.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.111
Until you need them, right?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.813
Exactly.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.849
He's a son of a bitch,
but he's my son of a bitch.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.354
Maia, you can find a cubicle.

22:01.388 --> 22:02.922
It's still a hot desk system,

22:02.955 --> 22:05.091
so keep your laptop with you.

22:05.124 --> 22:08.461
And here we go, Lucca.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.497
Your new office.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.435
Uh, my office
is right across from you.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.769
Sounds good.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.972
I thought you'd be more unhappy.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.941
Would you excuse me?

22:24.711 --> 22:26.112
Hi.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.147
Want to include me in on this?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.149
Um, it's just a thought.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.718
About Maia's case?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.119
Yes.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.654
But you can't tell me?

22:34.687 --> 22:37.089
I was talking
about Amy's testimony.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.658
Diane, this is silly.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.560
You're telling Maia,
and Maia is telling me.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.095
Let's just cut out
the middleman.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.832
Is all this information coming
from our new name partner?

22:56.676 --> 22:59.512
Amy's not the surprise witness.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.947
She isn't?

23:00.980 --> 23:02.549
Who is?

23:08.120 --> 23:10.557
What do you know?

23:10.590 --> 23:13.059
The Rindell Foundation.

23:13.092 --> 23:16.128
I drew up
the papers of incorporation.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.700
They're gonna come after me
for my work on the foundation.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.536
That is not good.
No.

23:23.570 --> 23:27.474
The advantage that this gives us
is we know it's coming.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.876
We prepare your testimony.
Yes.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.645
And I act surprised
when they subpoena me.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.781
That's a start.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.589
I will call Colin.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.692
Ask if he can do
any better than a year.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.927
I think I might have
another option.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.762
What?

23:49.796 --> 23:51.864
I can't say right now.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.050
<i>Diane Lockhart's office.</i>

24:11.083 --> 24:13.586
Uh, she'll get back to you.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.622
I need help.

24:15.655 --> 24:18.157
Fuck yeah. What?

24:18.190 --> 24:20.960
Uh...

24:20.993 --> 24:23.730
the FBI,
they gave this photo to us.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.598
Now, this woman,

24:25.632 --> 24:28.835
she picked up a million dollars
from one of my dad's

24:28.868 --> 24:30.703
overseas bank accounts in Dubai.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.872
Oh, my God. Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.574
Now, the FBI don't know
who she is,

24:34.607 --> 24:35.842
but I think I do.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.811
Okay, who is it?

24:38.845 --> 24:40.980
Rosalie Richetta.
Richetta.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.715
I'm taking some notes, okay?

24:42.749 --> 24:44.250
Between us, right?

24:44.283 --> 24:46.152
Hey.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.863
She was my old tennis coach
hired by my parents,

24:47.887 --> 24:49.255
and I think
she's helping my dad.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.791
You want to locate her
to locate him?
Yes.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.626
He has evidence that will prove

24:53.660 --> 24:55.628
I am not responsible
for the foundation.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.565
Make that clear
if you speak to her.

24:58.598 --> 24:59.942
It's not about
my dad returning, okay?

24:59.966 --> 25:02.201
It is not about him
giving up his freedom.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.103
It is about the evidence
that will keep me

25:04.136 --> 25:06.105
from going to jail
for five years.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.007
It's the least he can do.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.810
I'll find her.
Thank you.

25:10.843 --> 25:14.581
I remember her talking about
living in Little Village,

25:14.614 --> 25:16.749
but she's not there anymore.
Got it.

25:16.783 --> 25:20.753
Hey, if I can, I'm
keeping you out of prison.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.221
Thank you.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.996
No.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.598
Your-You're shitting me?

25:31.631 --> 25:32.932
No.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.568
Oh. Will Gardner
would've taken ten years?

25:35.602 --> 25:38.070
He probably would've
taken 15 years.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.272
Oh, my God.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.941
We had a bad case.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.611
Oh, man.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.679
Well he, he was a good lawyer.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.749
Oh, he, he was.
He was a badass.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.651
Yeah.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.053
Hey, how come, how come
we never fought each other?

25:54.086 --> 25:55.622
Huh?

25:55.655 --> 25:56.989
You were afraid.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.660
Okay.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.961
All right.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.365
I need to ask you this.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.668
I'm ready.

26:08.701 --> 26:11.203
Why you slipping us information?

26:11.237 --> 26:12.839
Why?

26:12.872 --> 26:14.974
Yeah. You don't need to.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.744
We only want you for your name.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.381
Ah, you know.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.685
I made my life the
U.S. Attorney's Office.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.053
Ten years.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.821
Ten fucking years.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.089
Can you believe that?

26:30.122 --> 26:32.692
Yes, unfortunately, I can.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.795
They suck you dry.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.931
Yep, they do.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.367
And then they just... poof...

26:41.400 --> 26:45.037
You just don't
exist to them.
Mm.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.740
I wrote a tweet.
Mm.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.309
Reasonable people should not
be allowed near tweets.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.680
No, I avoid them
like the plague.
Mm.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.282
And now I am gunning for them.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.251
I'm gonna destroy them.

27:01.821 --> 27:05.224
Ugh, it's terrible, huh?

27:05.257 --> 27:08.861
Yeah. Everybody's dying.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.998
People die.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.366
No. I-I just don't know

27:14.400 --> 27:16.769
what's going on in
the world anymore.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.706
I read the news,
I watch the news,

27:19.739 --> 27:22.809
and it doesn't make any sense.

27:22.842 --> 27:25.778
It's not just bad, it's insane.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.447
Well, you know, every generation
has its different insane.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.016
No, that's just to make us
feel better.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.418
But th-this is insane.

27:32.451 --> 27:35.354
George Orwell wouldn't know
where to start today.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.824
Yeah, well, what can we do
about it, you know?

27:37.857 --> 27:40.092
I don't know.
Take a break.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.895
Give it up.

27:42.929 --> 27:46.799
Find another worthy occupation.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.234
Pastry chef.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.304
Yes. Yes, all right.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.473
You and me, the two of us,
pastry chefs.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.242
Well...

27:56.275 --> 27:59.311
At least it, you know,
brings people pleasure.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.047
Mmm, yeah, yeah.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.216
People aren't shooting
their pastry chefs.

28:08.220 --> 28:12.124
Dark night of the soul.

28:12.158 --> 28:15.427
Who knew it can go on for weeks?

28:20.332 --> 28:23.402
<i> This cruel country</i>

28:23.435 --> 28:27.106
<i> Has driven me down</i>

28:27.139 --> 28:30.743
<i> Teased me and lied</i>

28:30.777 --> 28:33.345
<i> Teased me and lied</i>

28:33.379 --> 28:36.415
<i> I've only sad stories</i>

28:36.448 --> 28:39.819
<i> To tell to this town</i>

28:39.852 --> 28:42.889
<i> My dreams have withered...</i>

28:42.922 --> 28:44.924
I was under oath.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.936
What do you want to do?

29:00.907 --> 29:03.175
Give me a category
for the question.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.911
About us.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.059
I'm sorry.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.429
I was telling the truth.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.430
I-I was always...

29:24.463 --> 29:26.532
I did not nod.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.535
Y-Yes, you did.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.872
Amy, it's just the two
of us here.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.276
I did not nod.

29:41.513 --> 29:42.915
Then I'm a liar.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.518
Then I should just
leave right now.

29:46.552 --> 29:50.489
I mean, why stay with someone
who lies to put you in prison?

29:50.522 --> 29:54.226
<i> On the waters so wide</i>

29:54.260 --> 29:57.496
<i> The waters so wide</i>

29:57.529 --> 29:59.431
<i> Steal from the bed</i>

29:59.465 --> 30:02.935
<i> Of some good friend of mine</i>

30:11.477 --> 30:13.345
Maia.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.124
Maia.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.960
<i> I've only sad stories</i>

30:27.994 --> 30:31.430
<i> To tell to this town</i>

30:31.463 --> 30:34.466
<i> My dreams have withered</i>

30:34.500 --> 30:38.270
<i> And died</i>

30:38.304 --> 30:42.208
<i> My dreams have withered</i>

30:42.241 --> 30:44.110
<i> And died.</i>

30:57.356 --> 30:58.657
I love bounce houses.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.326
Me, too.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.170
Takes me back to being a kid.
Don't you want to

31:02.194 --> 31:04.663
just go in there and push
the kids out, and jump around?

31:06.432 --> 31:08.300
Uh, which one's yours?

31:08.334 --> 31:11.603
The one at the back, Timmy.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.573
Timmy, don't push.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.110
I'm Esther.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.379
Marissa.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.616
Hey, did you have a sister
who used to teach tennis?

31:24.650 --> 31:27.920
I did. Rosalie.
Do you know her?

31:27.954 --> 31:29.155
Yeah. My parents hired her.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.556
She was great.
She was.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.959
She is.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.060
Where is she now?

31:34.093 --> 31:35.127
Everywhere.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.996
Overseas.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.530
It's a very long walkabout.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.566
I want a long walkabout.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.269
We shouldn't have had kids.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.705
Does she ever get back?

31:46.738 --> 31:49.241
Rosalie? No.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.709
But I'll tell her you said hi.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.311
She calls once a week.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.646
Great. Then I have
a favor to ask.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.615
Oh?

31:56.648 --> 31:58.517
My girlfriend's name
is Maia Rindell.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.219
Rosalie used to coach her, too.

32:00.252 --> 32:04.723
And she needs Rosalie
to get in touch with her.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.725
Maia has a warning for
her father and Rosalie.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.594
The Feds are onto
their location.

32:08.627 --> 32:12.064
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.066
That's okay.
Your sister will.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.435
Tell her they're in danger
and to call this number.

32:16.468 --> 32:20.539
It's a burner number,
so it can't be traced.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.108
Who are you?

32:22.141 --> 32:24.343
Marissa.

32:33.752 --> 32:36.022
Thank you for testifying

32:36.055 --> 32:37.756
on such short notice,
Ms. Lockhart.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.259
I didn't have much choice;
I was subpoenaed.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.728
Your Honor, again, this is
prosecution by ambush.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.696
We are not prepared for
this surprise witness.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.532
Yes, and as I said,

32:46.565 --> 32:48.400
you will have time
if you need it.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.002
Please, continue.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.404
You drew up the
documents incorporating

32:52.438 --> 32:55.774
the Rindell Foundation as a 501.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.610
Is that right,
Ms. Lockhart?
Yes.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.680
And what was the stated purpose
of the Rindell Foundation?

33:01.713 --> 33:04.083
To provide medical and
educational assistance

33:04.116 --> 33:05.451
in the Third World.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.553
That's a worthy goal.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.489
Do you know how much medical

33:10.522 --> 33:13.192
and educational assistance

33:13.225 --> 33:15.394
the foundation provided
to the Third World?

33:15.427 --> 33:18.030
I do not.
Would it surprise
you to know

33:18.064 --> 33:19.098
that it delivered zero?

33:19.131 --> 33:21.100
No dollars. No goods.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.302
Objection.
Counselor is testifying.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.038
Yes, and quite well.
Overruled.

33:27.706 --> 33:31.743
Did Henry Rindell
ever ask you to draw up

33:31.777 --> 33:35.447
an addendum to the Rindell
Foundation incorporation?

33:36.582 --> 33:38.284
He did.

33:38.317 --> 33:41.653
And did you have any issues
with this addendum?

33:41.687 --> 33:44.123
I did.
Why?

33:44.156 --> 33:46.792
I thought it was questionable,
ethically.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.660
It mixed funds from
the Rindell Fund

33:48.694 --> 33:50.162
with those of the foundation.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.463
In fact, it allowed

33:51.497 --> 33:53.599
Mr. Rindell to park funds

33:53.632 --> 33:59.205
in order to avoid
SEC investigations.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.308
Why did you draw up
this addendum?

34:02.341 --> 34:04.243
I was ordered to.

34:04.276 --> 34:05.511
By whom?

34:05.544 --> 34:07.646
It was just a signed memo.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.547
She probably didn't know
what she was signing.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.449
Ms. Lockhart.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.418
Who ordered you
to mix the funds?

34:13.452 --> 34:17.789
The memo was signed
by Maia Rindell.

34:28.766 --> 34:32.371
Um, everything
all right, Ms. Rindell?

34:32.404 --> 34:35.440
Uh, yes, Your Honor.
My apologies... an emergency.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.277
Oh, okay. Uh, well,
we'll take a short recess.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.712
Yes, that was me.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.649
Yes. Wait, one second.

34:43.681 --> 34:45.351
It's Rosalie.

34:45.384 --> 34:46.784
Rosalie

34:46.818 --> 34:48.254
No, Rosalie.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.129
Hello.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.865
Maia?

35:01.467 --> 35:03.469
Yes.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.372
How are you doing?

35:06.405 --> 35:09.475
I... good.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.878
I-I mean, no, not really.

35:12.911 --> 35:16.582
How's your second serve?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.650
Probably about the same.

35:18.684 --> 35:20.752
I-I haven't played
in a long time.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.654
Well, you should get back to it.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.656
I might.

35:26.825 --> 35:30.196
Hey, where are you
living these days?

35:30.229 --> 35:32.431
Do you mind if
I don't answer that?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.633
It's kind of tricky here
right now.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.235
I understand.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.871
But, uh, I need
something from you.

35:39.905 --> 35:43.842
I need to speak to my father.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.945
I haven't seen your father
in years, Maia.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.847
Rosalie, that is not true.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.482
It is true.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.485
The FBI showed me a photo
of you, in Dubai,

35:53.519 --> 35:55.487
taking money out of his account.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.361
Look, I know my dad isn't
coming back anytime soon.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.231
I... I just really need
to talk to him.

36:05.264 --> 36:06.932
I have to get off
the phone now, Maia.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.767
No, no. Wait. Listen to me.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.738
The FBI told me something
that will help you both,

36:12.771 --> 36:16.375
something that will
help you avoid them.

36:18.944 --> 36:21.580
Rosalie?

36:21.613 --> 36:23.282
I'm here.

36:23.315 --> 36:26.885
I want to make a trade
with my dad.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.788
I need a piece of information
from him that will keep me

36:29.821 --> 36:31.690
out of prison.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.260
Now, I'm gonna give you the
number of another burner cell,

36:34.293 --> 36:37.563
and I need my dad to
call me tomorrow morning

36:37.596 --> 36:39.498
00 Chicago time.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.966
And if he doesn't,

36:40.999 --> 36:44.536
then I am going to let the FBI
find both of you.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.441
Ms. Lockhart, could you read

36:49.475 --> 36:52.811
the CEO obligations in these
articles of incorporation?

36:52.844 --> 36:54.413
"Oversee board of the directors,

36:54.446 --> 36:57.349
"any fundraising
and financial management,

36:57.383 --> 36:59.585
oversight of infrastructure
and foundation budget."

36:59.618 --> 37:01.019
And these articles are,

37:01.052 --> 37:03.289
in fact, for another
nonprofit, correct?

37:03.322 --> 37:04.523
It appears to be.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.358
But the language itself

37:06.392 --> 37:09.328
is almost exactly the same
as from Maia's foundation?

37:09.361 --> 37:10.896
Yes.
Now, this is a memo

37:10.929 --> 37:12.364
signed by...

37:12.398 --> 37:15.267
the other nonprofit's CEO.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.437
Could you tell me
what it states?

37:18.470 --> 37:21.440
That nonprofit funds
should be mixed

37:21.473 --> 37:24.410
with the sponsoring body's
for-profit funds...

37:24.443 --> 37:25.744
I'm sorry. Objection.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.280
What... what is this

37:28.314 --> 37:29.957
Why are we looking at this?
We're trying to show

37:29.981 --> 37:31.917
that the memo signed
unknowingly by Maia...

37:31.950 --> 37:33.419
Objection to
"unknowingly."

37:33.452 --> 37:34.586
I'll withdraw.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.522
That the memo signed by Maia

37:36.555 --> 37:39.358
is not all that unusual
for a nonprofit CEO.

37:39.391 --> 37:42.060
Well, this seems like
a long way around, but... sure,

37:42.093 --> 37:44.496
overruled.
Now, Ms. Lockhart,

37:44.530 --> 37:46.865
what is the stated purpose
of this other nonprofit?

37:46.898 --> 37:49.000
Could you please read there?

37:49.034 --> 37:50.969
"To supply
South American countries

37:51.002 --> 37:52.971
with legal assistance
and education."

37:53.004 --> 37:54.873
A worthy goal. Yes?

37:54.906 --> 37:56.442
Yes.
And according to
this document,

37:56.475 --> 37:59.745
has the Kerry Foundation
yet fulfilled this goal?

37:59.778 --> 38:02.381
Yeah, okay, got it, got it.
I got it.

38:02.414 --> 38:03.782
Thank you.
I don't.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.417
Uh, it's a foundation

38:05.451 --> 38:07.586
of which I am on the board.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.356
We have actually
not done all that much,

38:10.389 --> 38:12.724
and I am responsible
for us meeting

38:12.758 --> 38:14.993
once in... six years.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.028
And yes, I signed that memo

38:17.062 --> 38:18.730
without looking at it.
Your Honor,

38:18.764 --> 38:19.874
we mean no offense.
No, none taken.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.634
I... We-we
should have done better.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.870
Yes, but, Your Honor, your
nonprofit was not used

38:24.903 --> 38:27.639
to park money from
a Ponzi scheme.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.942
Yes. But if I'm honest,
I wouldn't know it.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.878
Thank you, Your Honor.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.513
No further questions.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.648
Um, and it appears you
didn't need additional time

38:36.682 --> 38:39.084
to prepare for this witness.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.687
We just lucked out.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.823
Counselors,
does the prosecution rest?

38:47.559 --> 38:48.960
Counselors?

38:48.994 --> 38:51.430
Your Honor,
we have one more witness.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.965
But it requires transporting her
from Greenville.

38:53.999 --> 38:57.002
So she's incarcerated?

38:57.035 --> 39:00.138
Uh, yes, Your Honor.
It's the defendant's mother,

39:00.171 --> 39:02.040
Lenore Rindell.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.821
What could your mother say?

39:15.854 --> 39:17.689
I really don't know.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.858
Did she ever mention

39:19.891 --> 39:21.860
anything that was incriminating?

39:26.097 --> 39:27.666
If she's testifying

39:27.699 --> 39:30.068
against you, that means
they've offered her a deal.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.570
If they've offered her a deal,

39:31.603 --> 39:33.472
she has something to say
that can hurt you.

39:33.505 --> 39:36.608
You want to know all the details

39:36.642 --> 39:38.043
of running an investment fund?

39:38.076 --> 39:40.145
No.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.514
No, I...

39:42.548 --> 39:45.050
I just want to know
if there's a problem.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.552
There's lots of problems.

39:46.585 --> 39:47.619
We should be prepared

39:47.653 --> 39:49.755
to attack her credibility.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.123
You have no idea...

39:52.157 --> 39:53.625
what she's going to say?

39:53.659 --> 39:55.494
The people

39:55.527 --> 39:56.762
who invest with us

39:56.795 --> 39:59.465
believe your father
walks on water.

40:01.199 --> 40:04.736
And he wants them to
go on believing that.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.107
What does that mean?

40:11.042 --> 40:13.712
He offsets his losses.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.213
Offsets them how?

40:15.246 --> 40:17.115
I don't know how.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.951
She told me there were problems.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.887
What sort of problems?

40:22.888 --> 40:25.491
A system to offset losses.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.794
But no details.
I mean...

40:28.827 --> 40:30.729
nothing else.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.634
What do I do?

40:50.549 --> 40:52.851
Hey.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.587
That was just Joe Swoboda
on the phone.

40:55.621 --> 40:57.155
The heating oil king.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.590
And?

40:58.624 --> 41:00.191
He's coming on board.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.734
Aah...!

41:08.767 --> 41:10.602
Yeah.

41:10.636 --> 41:13.171
Not bad, Miss Liz...

41:13.204 --> 41:14.840
first week.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.174
I can retire now?

41:17.843 --> 41:19.978
You're not what I expected.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.913
Getting a lot of that.
Keep it up.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.550
Oh.

41:24.583 --> 41:27.653
Hey. I wonder if we
should keep our eyes out

41:27.686 --> 41:29.755
for bringing on another partner.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.724
Why?
Diane Lockhart.

41:32.758 --> 41:34.660
She's thinking of leaving.

41:34.693 --> 41:37.128
What Yeah.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.697
All these deaths now.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.231
She's thinking of retiring.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.133
She never said anything to you?

41:42.167 --> 41:43.902
No.
Oh.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.004
Well... maybe I have it wrong.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.539
Don't-don't say I said anything.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.040
Let her bring it up.

41:49.074 --> 41:52.043
But, uh, she said it was
her dark night of the soul.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.546
Anyway...

41:54.580 --> 41:55.914
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.883
Yeah. Okay.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.120
♪

42:12.931 --> 42:14.900
It's a little late, isn't it?

42:14.933 --> 42:16.868
Hey, how's Ford doing?

42:16.902 --> 42:19.170
Better. Second heart attack.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.772
He needs to go easier.

42:20.806 --> 42:22.207
Say hello for me.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.809
I will.

42:23.842 --> 42:26.211
You know this
is unorthodox?
Yes.

42:26.244 --> 42:29.147
And if you say no, you say no.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.683
Who do you want to see?

42:32.718 --> 42:34.753
Lenore Rindell.

42:34.786 --> 42:37.122
She was just transferred
from Greenville.

42:37.155 --> 42:40.659
Okay. I'll give you
ten minutes with her.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.662
Let's hope that's enough.

42:55.173 --> 42:57.142
"I swear or affirm

42:57.175 --> 43:00.211
"that the testimony
I'm about to give

43:00.245 --> 43:04.650
is the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

43:04.683 --> 43:07.352
Thank you,
ma'am. You may sit.

43:11.957 --> 43:14.225
Could you state
your name, please?

43:14.259 --> 43:16.895
Lenore Rindell.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.129
And what is your address?

43:19.164 --> 43:22.400
Uh, FCI Greenville,

43:22.433 --> 43:24.736
satellite 2.

43:24.770 --> 43:27.773
And that's the female
minimum security prison

43:27.806 --> 43:29.875
in Greenville?
Yes.

43:29.908 --> 43:31.710
And how long have you
been incarcerated?

43:31.743 --> 43:32.944
Two months.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.946
You pled guilty to fraud?

43:34.980 --> 43:36.782
Yes.

43:36.815 --> 43:40.118
And the defendant here is
your daughter, correct?

43:41.953 --> 43:43.655
Yes.

43:43.689 --> 43:46.792
You're aware that she is
on trial for fraud as well?

43:48.727 --> 43:50.395
Yes.
Ms. Rindell,

43:50.428 --> 43:53.364
do you have any testimony
to share with the court

43:53.398 --> 43:55.967
regarding your daughter's guilt?

43:58.336 --> 44:00.906
I do.
Good.

44:00.939 --> 44:03.384
And just so the defense doesn't
have to ask you these questions,

44:03.408 --> 44:04.810
did the Department of Justice

44:04.843 --> 44:08.747
offer you a reduction
in sentence

44:08.780 --> 44:10.749
in trade for this testimony?

44:10.782 --> 44:11.917
They did.

44:11.950 --> 44:13.985
And what was that offer?

44:14.019 --> 44:17.188
I am now serving
an eight-year sentence.

44:17.222 --> 44:21.126
That sentence would be reduced
to time served.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.128
Thank you.

44:23.161 --> 44:25.163
Now, could you please

44:25.196 --> 44:26.998
tell the court
what you told your daughter

44:27.032 --> 44:29.901
regarding the fund
and the foundation

44:29.935 --> 44:32.938
on July 6, 2016.

44:35.974 --> 44:38.710
I don't remember
telling her anything.

44:44.082 --> 44:45.383
Ms. Rindell,

44:45.416 --> 44:48.153
did you not specifically
inform your daughter

44:48.186 --> 44:50.388
that the fund and the foundation

44:50.421 --> 44:51.957
were being run illegally?

44:51.990 --> 44:53.992
No. When did I do that?

44:54.025 --> 44:56.027
Ms. Rindell,
did you not warn

44:56.061 --> 44:57.462
your daughter
that she was at risk

44:57.495 --> 44:59.197
of going to jail?
I know what

44:59.230 --> 45:02.000
you're talking about...
We were planning a vacation.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.501
A vacation?
To Vail.

45:03.534 --> 45:07.405
Somebody must have thought
I said "jail."

45:07.438 --> 45:09.875
Ms. Rindell,
you...

45:09.908 --> 45:11.509
Are you aware

45:11.542 --> 45:14.145
that making false statements
under oath is a crime?

45:14.179 --> 45:16.447
Yes.
And that any
arrangement

45:16.481 --> 45:21.019
regarding your sentence is
dependent upon your testimony?

45:22.954 --> 45:24.923
Yes.

45:30.996 --> 45:33.264
No further questions,
Your Honor.

45:42.573 --> 45:45.777
Anything from the defense?

45:45.811 --> 45:47.779
No, Your Honor.

45:47.813 --> 45:49.247
Thank you, ma'am.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.882
You are dismissed.

46:09.868 --> 46:11.336
What do you think?

46:11.369 --> 46:13.204
I think my dad has
a lot of issues,

46:13.238 --> 46:15.306
but lateness isn't one of them.

46:15.340 --> 46:18.443
So if he hasn't called...

46:29.988 --> 46:32.323
Hello?

46:32.357 --> 46:35.260
Hello, sweetheart.

46:35.293 --> 46:36.962
Dad.

46:36.995 --> 46:39.497
It is so good to hear
your voice, Maia.

46:39.530 --> 46:41.099
Yours, too.

46:41.132 --> 46:44.069
I'm sorry about the way
this all went down.

46:44.102 --> 46:47.305
None of it is what I wanted.

46:47.338 --> 46:49.074
I know. I know.

46:49.107 --> 46:50.976
I love you, Maia.

46:51.009 --> 46:52.610
I love your mother.

46:52.643 --> 46:56.114
I want to help you
in any way I can.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.849
Uh-huh.

46:57.883 --> 46:59.550
Mm-hmm. I know.

47:02.020 --> 47:05.523
What is it about the Feds
you wanted to say?

47:05.556 --> 47:07.358
Uh...

47:07.392 --> 47:10.061
they offered a deal, Dad.

47:10.095 --> 47:12.263
If you turn yourself in,

47:12.297 --> 47:15.133
they'll let Mom off
with time served,

47:15.166 --> 47:18.970
and I...
wouldn't be prosecuted.

47:19.004 --> 47:22.173
If they had you in custody.

47:25.243 --> 47:26.878
Dad?

47:29.014 --> 47:33.885
Yeah. I thought it was something
about my location, Maia.

47:33.919 --> 47:37.488
The Feds have a picture
of Rosalie in Dubai?

47:39.557 --> 47:41.059
Uh-huh.

47:41.092 --> 47:43.561
Uh, yeah, and, uh...

47:43.594 --> 47:45.630
another one in Italy, too.

47:46.664 --> 47:49.234
Um, do they know exactly

47:49.267 --> 47:51.269
where in Italy, dear?

47:52.270 --> 47:53.571
No.

47:53.604 --> 47:55.240
No, not yet.

47:55.273 --> 47:57.208
How far off, Captain?

47:57.242 --> 47:59.911
Mom's in jail, Dad,

47:59.945 --> 48:01.512
and she is really suffering.

48:01.546 --> 48:04.449
She had a chance to get out
if she testified against me,

48:04.482 --> 48:06.017
but she wouldn't.

48:06.051 --> 48:07.385
I miss you, Maia.
Sh-She...

48:07.418 --> 48:09.187
I miss you both so very much.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.489
Then turn yourself in.

48:14.159 --> 48:17.495
Do you remember when
I broke my arm in third grade

48:17.528 --> 48:21.699
and... I was crying so bad,

48:21.732 --> 48:23.701
and... and you said,

48:23.734 --> 48:27.638
you said to me
that you would do anything

48:27.672 --> 48:30.141
to take my pain away?

48:30.175 --> 48:32.143
Do you remember?

48:32.177 --> 48:34.045
Well, you can.

48:35.080 --> 48:36.381
Dad, you can.

48:36.414 --> 48:41.252
You can take my pain away,
and Mom's.

48:43.188 --> 48:44.589
Please.

48:44.622 --> 48:46.591
Maia, Maia,
you don't understand.

48:46.624 --> 48:49.294
They'll crucify me.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.296
There's no negotiating
with them. Th-There...

48:51.329 --> 48:53.064
I'm sorry, Maia,

48:53.098 --> 48:55.133
but I have to go.
I love you very much.

48:55.166 --> 48:57.602
Please believe me. Hey, hey,
hey, hey! Calma, calma.

48:57.635 --> 49:00.105
Be calm. Take it easy.
I'm innocent.

49:02.073 --> 49:03.341
No, no, no, no. I'm innocent.

49:05.276 --> 49:07.512
Maia, Maia, call the consulate.

49:07.545 --> 49:09.214
They're-they're arresting me.

49:09.247 --> 49:10.481
Maia! Maia! Maia!

49:10.515 --> 49:12.517
I didn't do...
Bye, Dad.

49:12.550 --> 49:15.020
Maia...
