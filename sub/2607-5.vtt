- Then she sues for defamation.
- She posed for the pictures.

- Copyright.
- It was his camera.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.359
She gave it to him. He owns the pictures

<i>Vice President Biden was in Toledo, Ohio,</i>
<i>today speaking to the UAW...</i>

10:31.841 --> 10:33.384
- Neal.
- Yeah?

10:33.467 --> 10:34.885
Can you unblock a number for me?

10:34.969 --> 10:36.387
- You can do it.
- How?

10:37.388 --> 10:39.307
By listening when I taught you how to do it.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.600
Transfer the call to my line.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.394
Alim, are you still with me? Samirah?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.104
SAMIRAH: <i>Yes.</i>
ALIM: <i>I'm still here.</i>

10:45.187 --> 10:47.481
JIM: We're working with authorities,
so hang in there and breathe.

10:47.565 --> 10:49.525
- ALIM: <i>All right.</i>
- Okay.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.090
(BEEPS)

11:15.176 --> 11:16.719
Jim, it's in.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.766
- Download it.
- I'm sorry?

11:22.308 --> 11:24.060
- Download it.
- Download what?

11:24.143 --> 11:25.519
The 911 tapes.

11:25.603 --> 11:26.896
- What does "download" mean?
- Maggie.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.564
It's downloading.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.778
- How long is the tape?
- Four minutes and seven seconds.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.238
- How long does that take to download?
- It really depends.

11:36.906 --> 11:38.366
(CHIMES)

11:43.579 --> 11:45.456
All I want in the world is for you

11:45.539 --> 11:48.042
to be standing
over my shoulder for the next 99%.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.460
You're in luck.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.795
- Neal.
- Yeah?

11:51.670 --> 11:54.632
Shit. I thought he was in a package.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.926
I'm in the shot. All right, just be cool.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.762
- (SCOFFS) Okay, you first.
- Can you... Shut up.

11:59.929 --> 12:01.847
- Can you block the site?
- I already did.

12:01.931 --> 12:03.766
- In the office?
- Yeah. Why, can you block it everywhere?

12:03.849 --> 12:05.017
- No.
- Well, I didn't know.

12:05.101 --> 12:07.561
- How could I block it everywhere?
- You said... Never mind.

12:07.645 --> 12:09.021
Did you know there's an organization called

12:09.105 --> 12:11.399
The Righteous Daughters
of Jihadi Excellence?

12:11.482 --> 12:12.775
No.

12:16.654 --> 12:18.155
(INDISTINCT)

12:24.703 --> 12:26.455
What was that?

12:26.539 --> 12:28.499
WorldNetDaily has a reputable source

12:28.582 --> 12:31.419
saying Simon Weingarden
may have once accepted a speaking fee

12:31.502 --> 12:33.671
from The Righteous Daughters
of Jihadi Excellence.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.757
You wouldn't have to pay me. I'd give
anything to speak at one of those meetings.

12:36.841 --> 12:39.927
Keeping in mind that WorldNetDaily
reported that Obama murdered his gay lover...

12:40.010 --> 12:41.929
No, he didn't murder him,
he had him murdered.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.514
And it wasn't his gay lover,
it was his husband.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.683
- So they got other facts wrong, too?
- Yeah.

12:45.766 --> 12:49.478
Keeping that in mind, what do you think
WorldNetDaily considers a reputable source?

12:49.562 --> 12:51.689
In this case? Me.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.358
I need to make a call.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.174
<i>While the President struck</i>
<i>a somewhat sarcastic tone,</i>

13:18.257 --> 13:21.427
<i>the Vice President pulled no punches,</i>
<i>perhaps offering a preview of the...</i>

13:21.510 --> 13:23.220
Philip, it's Don Keefer.

13:23.304 --> 13:25.890
I just read a story on WND

13:25.973 --> 13:28.309
blind-quoting a source
who says Weingarden spoke

13:28.392 --> 13:30.603
to The Righteous Daughters
of Jihadi Excellence,

13:30.686 --> 13:32.938
and that group sounded oddly familiar to me.

13:33.022 --> 13:34.398
Could you call me back at the office?

13:34.482 --> 13:36.108
And if you call between
10:00 and 11:00, tell them I said

13:36.192 --> 13:38.194
to put you through to the control room.
We gotta fix this.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.572
- What happened?
- Jesus!

13:41.655 --> 13:43.866
I'm sorry. I'm down here.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.286
It's all right.

13:54.752 --> 13:56.212
What are you doing?

13:56.295 --> 13:59.215
Just hanging out.
Grant's in my office. Our office.

13:59.924 --> 14:01.967
You shouldn't be sharing an office anymore.

14:02.051 --> 14:03.511
I don't mind.

14:03.594 --> 14:06.680
I like Grant and he's usually in D.C.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.641
Brings his dog in sometimes.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.560
Basset hound. Always looks very puzzled.
Just confounded.

14:12.436 --> 14:14.563
But working on it, you know?

14:15.147 --> 14:20.152
Just everybody slow down
and let me catch up 'cause I'm down here.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.785
There was no way to see this coming.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.454
He was a really nice guy.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.581
Totally trusted him.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.966
(SOBS)

14:45.469 --> 14:46.512
It's all right.

14:54.979 --> 14:57.231
It's because
everyone's downloading at the same time.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.482
Yeah.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.571
Hey, I read Hallie's column yesterday.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.906
- On Sandra Fluke?
- That chick can write.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.741
I'll tell her you said so.

15:07.825 --> 15:09.243
She knows who I am?

15:09.326 --> 15:10.828
Sure. Yeah.

15:11.579 --> 15:13.372
Why wouldn't she?

15:13.664 --> 15:15.165
I don't know.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.292
She does.

15:18.294 --> 15:20.004
- How did it come up?
- You?

15:20.087 --> 15:21.672
I'm just curious.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.133
I don't know. I'm sure I mentioned you

15:24.216 --> 15:26.051
when I was on the bus with her.
Talked about everybody.

15:26.135 --> 15:27.428
Well, tell her she's been on fire lately.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.430
It's not hard
to light her on fire with Sandra Fluke.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.765
- She ain't the only one.
- Yeah.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.184
What do you mean?

15:35.227 --> 15:36.854
You don't think there's a little phony outrage?

15:37.563 --> 15:39.356
- Really?
- Just a little? Little bit?

15:40.983 --> 15:43.027
- No.
- A little of the ol', "Hey, how do you do?"

15:43.110 --> 15:46.655
A little, "Hey, how's your uncle?"
Texas two-step, refried beans, nothin'?

15:49.408 --> 15:51.535
You think anyone else is getting it faster?

15:51.619 --> 15:54.997
Is everyone downloading it at the same speed
or is CNN on the air with it already?

15:55.080 --> 15:57.291
Gary, is anyone up yet with the 911 tape?

15:57.374 --> 15:58.751
No.

15:59.209 --> 16:02.713
Anyway, I was glad
for Hallie's piece about Sandra Fluke.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.382
And the two pieces
that came before that about Sandra Fluke.

16:05.466 --> 16:08.260
And I'm looking forward to her upcoming
series <i>White Men, I Think I Hate Them.</i>

16:08.344 --> 16:09.803
- She writes about women's issues.
- Sexism.

16:09.887 --> 16:12.640
- It's in the news right now.
- You say that like we can't help it.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.141
What can I tell you?
I hit send, it's in the news.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.143
Would you prefer nobody wrote about it?

16:16.226 --> 16:18.395
No, but can I show you something?

16:18.479 --> 16:19.980
I didn't read it on her blog.

16:20.064 --> 16:21.982
It was picked up by <i>The Huffington Post.</i>

16:22.066 --> 16:23.150
She was very happy about that.

16:23.233 --> 16:26.654
And look, to get to Hallie's piece
about the epidemic of sexism,

16:26.737 --> 16:28.864
you have to scroll past
two stories on side boobs,

16:28.947 --> 16:31.825
"Six Things You Never
Should Say To a Woman With Big Boobs,"

16:31.909 --> 16:35.037
"Alicia Keys' Nip Slip,"
"Britney's Nip Slip," "This Week In Nip Slips,"

16:35.120 --> 16:37.998
and "Scarlett Johansson's
Busty Red Carpet Look a Distraction."

16:38.082 --> 16:41.085
A distraction from what, they never say.
I think they were busy looking for sexism.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.505
Can you go back to the download?

16:48.175 --> 16:49.760
17%.

16:51.679 --> 16:53.222
Polls close at 8:00 p.m. Eastern

16:53.305 --> 16:56.225
and our full coverage begins
at 5:00 here on ACN.

16:56.308 --> 16:58.143
<i>We'll be back after this.</i>

16:58.435 --> 16:59.603
JAKE: We're out.
HERB: Three minutes back.

16:59.687 --> 17:00.938
MAN: Yeah, we're clear.

17:02.314 --> 17:04.274
(SIGHS) You wanted me?

17:04.358 --> 17:07.528
What's the Twitter problem
you started to talk to me about?

17:07.820 --> 17:09.863
It seemed like Mac really didn't want me
to bother you with it.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.573
She doesn't get to make that decision.

17:11.657 --> 17:13.701
So please just tell me
before she walks in here.

17:13.784 --> 17:16.453
You ran into a woman
in a restaurant at lunch, Pepper Burke.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.622
- I don't know who that is.
- She writes for the <i>Post.</i>

17:18.706 --> 17:20.624
- What did I do?
- It sounds like you didn't recognize her.

17:20.708 --> 17:21.709
I'm sure that's true.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.503
"@WillMcAvoy blew me off at Smith&Wol."
Steak?

17:24.962 --> 17:27.047
- Have you got the next packet?
- WILL: <i>I didn't blow her off.</i>

17:27.131 --> 17:30.342
NEAL: <i>"I was carrying two coffees.</i>
<i>Must have thought I was a waitress.</i>

17:30.426 --> 17:33.470
"He's not who he thinks he is,
but exactly who we think he is."

17:33.971 --> 17:37.766
Neal, a woman walked up to me
as I was leaving and said hello.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.728
And I said hello. What in the fuck?

17:41.145 --> 17:43.313
- What you got, Sampat?
- Nothing.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.982
- A woman on Twitter...
- God damn it.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.233
Can we please settle who my boss is?

17:46.316 --> 17:47.401
- It's me.
- It's me.

17:47.484 --> 17:48.527
- It's him.
- It's me.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.195
A woman says I snubbed her in a restaurant.

17:50.279 --> 17:52.239
Should we try to get that into the D block?

17:52.322 --> 17:54.491
- How many followers does she have?
- It doesn't matter.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.326
- She's got a few.
- And retweets?

17:56.410 --> 17:58.871
- Sure, and it was also picked up by BuzzFeed.
- Come on!

17:58.954 --> 18:01.999
It should be obvious to you by now
that fundamentally small people

18:02.082 --> 18:04.918
are going to try to raise
their profile by standing on your neck.

18:05.002 --> 18:06.587
- (SIGHS)
- Could we have a second?

18:06.670 --> 18:08.338
- Sure, yeah. But then I need you.
- I'll be right there.

18:08.422 --> 18:10.257
In the next break,
we're composing a response.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.508
Neal.

18:12.050 --> 18:17.181
I don't get paid any extra when this happens,
and it happens all the time and it's always me.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.224
HERB: One minute.

18:19.308 --> 18:20.934
I was polite to her. I swear to God.

18:21.018 --> 18:22.895
Turn off your mic pack.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.653
Nothing bad is gonna happen
if you're kind to him right now.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.157
On the other hand, if you make
the other choice and you're wrong,

18:35.657 --> 18:37.743
you will never be able to undo it.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.244
That's a scientific fact.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.955
I'm being kind, MacKenzie.
What do you want me to do?

18:42.039 --> 18:44.208
- I'm supposed to call back at 9:00.
- Call his phone.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.126
- He can't talk right now.
- Leave a message for him.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.795
Just show him you called. He'll freak.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.630
- I'm in the middle of...
- In the next break.

18:49.713 --> 18:52.132
(SIGHS) He and I need to talk,
not just a message.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.760
I know that, but start with a message

18:54.843 --> 18:57.888
so when it gets to the talk, it doesn't start
with, "Why didn't you call me?"

18:57.971 --> 18:59.473
I'll do it in the next break.

18:59.556 --> 19:00.682
Good.

19:04.061 --> 19:06.146
I really do think tonight is one of those nights

19:06.230 --> 19:08.398
when you should just do
everything I tell you to do.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.318
How exactly would that
be different from every other...

19:11.401 --> 19:12.903
Thirty seconds.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.536
You're like his drug dealer on this stuff.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.412
The right response might not be a bad idea.

19:22.496 --> 19:23.914
It's gonna keep going for 24 hours.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.666
She's gonna have to become
a star by doing something

19:25.749 --> 19:27.000
or sleeping with someone.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.210
I wanted you to see something.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.796
- When Pepper Burke tweeted...
- I'm gonna kill you tonight.

19:30.921 --> 19:33.340
No, this isn't that.
She used the hashtag <i>News Night.</i>

19:33.423 --> 19:35.425
So I was looking
at other tweets with our hashtag

19:35.509 --> 19:38.720
and this one was posted six minutes ago
from our hair and makeup room.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.227
Are you kidding me?

19:48.772 --> 19:50.816
I'll talk to him when I can.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.779
I know this isn't your fault,
but I really do hate you anyway.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.949
I don't care that it's irrational. It is what it is.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.118
Tonight I root for your failure.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.415
HERB: In three, two...

20:06.707 --> 20:08.876
<i>(NEWS NIGHT</i> THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>to a federal mandate</i>
<i>that women's health insurance plans...</i>

20:17.384 --> 20:19.553
Thank you. Get in here.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.848
Charlie Skinner at ACN,
I will not help you with your sleeper cell.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.766
- Get in.
- How you doing?

20:25.017 --> 20:27.644
You really think you should
be spotted coming to see me?

20:27.769 --> 20:30.272
I'm a press liaison for the ONI.
Why do you treat me like a secret agent?

20:30.355 --> 20:31.815
- 'Cause you're a fucking secret agent.
- No.

20:31.899 --> 20:33.525
- You know you are.
- I am not.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.652
- You're a ghost.
- I work in public affairs at Naval Intelligence.

20:35.736 --> 20:38.739
You're a fucking spook and you know it.
I don't know if you're with us or Mossad.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.365
- I'm not Mossad.
- I'm compromised now.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.993
- You got anything to drink?
- Yeah.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.412
And you know what else?
Every time you see me,

20:45.495 --> 20:47.080
it's about something stupid.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.582
SHEP: That's just hurtful.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.918
Everybody else comes and says please,

20:51.001 --> 20:54.171
report where the missile landed,
but not where it was launched.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.465
And that makes sense to me.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.675
With you, it's please don't report

20:58.759 --> 21:01.595
that we're building
a computer center in the mountains of Utah.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.055
That's not a stupid ask.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.806
What do you care if people
know that the Navy's

21:04.890 --> 21:06.600
building a computer center outside Provo?

21:06.683 --> 21:08.602
- They might make fun of us.
- (LAUGHS) Why?

21:08.685 --> 21:10.604
It's hot there in the summer
and computers get hot

21:10.687 --> 21:13.023
and people say we're stupid,
don't know what we're doing.

21:13.106 --> 21:16.193
When the truth is the Navy has an excellent
track record of knowing what it's doing.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.903
We saw the potential in Mav and Goose

21:17.986 --> 21:20.739
and we sent them to Miramar, which I
don't think the Air Force would have done.

21:20.822 --> 21:24.076
And you've got the Roswell crowd that's
gonna say it's a rec center for Mormon aliens.

21:24.159 --> 21:25.994
- Is it?
- I've already said too much.

21:26.078 --> 21:29.289
You've got four
25,000-square-foot rooms full of servers,

21:29.373 --> 21:32.250
1.7 million gallons of coolant a day,

21:32.334 --> 21:34.670
and you want to hold yottabytes of data.

21:34.753 --> 21:38.966
I do not have the first earthly idea
what a yottabyte of data is,

21:39.049 --> 21:43.720
but the kids downstairs tell me
it's equal to 500 quintillion pages of text.

21:44.262 --> 21:48.266
Did not know what a quintillion was,
so I found out and it's a lot.

21:49.226 --> 21:52.938
Have our enemies produced
a yottabyte's worth of text?

21:53.021 --> 21:54.481
Has the human race?

21:54.564 --> 21:58.610
Still, we'd rather not add
one more high-value target to anyone's book.

21:59.319 --> 22:03.657
This may sound mean to say,
but if North Korea is ranking targets,

22:03.740 --> 22:07.536
I wouldn't mind if the mountains of Utah
took the place of, for instance, my house.

22:07.661 --> 22:10.080
The world's not gonna be ended by a bomb.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.499
It's gonna be a disgruntled kid.

22:12.582 --> 22:16.086
He's gonna hack into the grid,
open dams, canals, flood towns,

22:16.169 --> 22:18.505
change pipeline pressures
to key oil and gas centers,

22:18.588 --> 22:20.966
causing hellacious explosions
in populated areas.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.260
How's Nancy?

22:24.052 --> 22:26.388
She's finishing up a book on Jackson.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.514
And Sophie?

22:27.597 --> 22:28.765
She's in Amherst.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.434
- What's she majoring in?
- Philosophy.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.020
What do you do with a philosophy degree?

22:33.103 --> 22:37.774
It takes all the energy I have not to ask
that question at Thanksgiving.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.446
I don't give a shit
about the computers in Utah.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.114
Report whatever you want.

22:47.325 --> 22:50.287
If you don't care, what are you doing here?

22:50.787 --> 22:53.707
You've got a producer at your D.C. bureau

22:53.790 --> 22:56.418
named Jerry Dantana.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.003
Yeah.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.630
Why has he been spending
the last seven months

23:00.714 --> 23:03.050
asking people about a black op called Genoa?

23:06.511 --> 23:08.972
I'm not here for something stupid.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.560
A lion's walking through the woods
and he comes up to a zebra

23:13.643 --> 23:16.063
and the lion says,
"You know something, zebra?

23:16.146 --> 23:18.106
"You are a ridiculous looking animal.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.026
"You're half white,
half black, half horse, half donkey.

23:21.109 --> 23:25.489
"Look at me. I'm rough, I'm tough,
I'm the king of the jungle."

23:25.572 --> 23:27.699
Zebra just shrugs and moves on.

23:27.783 --> 23:31.411
Lion comes to a giraffe and the lion says,
"You know something, giraffe?

23:31.495 --> 23:33.789
"You are a ridiculous looking animal.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.957
"You've got a long neck and little horns.

23:36.041 --> 23:39.586
"Look at me. I'm rough, I'm tough,
I'm the king of the jungle."

23:39.669 --> 23:43.590
Lion comes to a frog and says,
(SCOFFS) "You know something, frog?

23:43.673 --> 23:45.634
"You are a ridiculous looking animal.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.177
"You're green and slimy."

23:47.260 --> 23:49.596
And the frog says,
"Hey, fuck you. I've been sick."

23:49.679 --> 23:50.806
(LAUGHING)

23:52.015 --> 23:53.517
You got to get your show ready.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.018
I'm all right.

23:55.102 --> 23:57.687
At some point,
I'm gonna have to call my parents.

23:57.771 --> 23:58.980
Do you have to?

24:00.190 --> 24:03.443
My father keeps a scrapbook on me.
He googles me every morning.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.612
- He's gonna understand.
- (CHUCKLES RUEFULLY)

24:07.155 --> 24:10.117
- He will.
- Not deep down. No one will.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.745
This is who I am now.

24:14.788 --> 24:16.581
What happened?

24:17.082 --> 24:18.625
You mean how did he...

24:18.708 --> 24:20.460
- Why did I pose?
- Was it a bad breakup?

24:20.544 --> 24:22.754
I didn't even know you were
going out with someone.

24:22.838 --> 24:24.965
He was a very well-respected analyst.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.716
We met at a <i>Forbes</i> party.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.468
No, I didn't think it was a bad breakup.

24:28.552 --> 24:30.637
He wasn't very upset about it.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.640
But even if it had been,
like, this would be okay?

24:33.723 --> 24:34.766
- No.
- What the fuck?

24:34.850 --> 24:35.851
I know.

24:36.268 --> 24:40.147
I am feeling so intensely something
that I don't know what it is.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.816
Rage.

24:44.025 --> 24:46.653
- You want me to scrap you from the rundown?
- Yes.

24:46.736 --> 24:47.737
You're supposed to do a segment...

24:47.821 --> 24:50.490
Yeah... No, I'm not going on TV
and interviewing...

24:50.574 --> 24:53.910
The guy is...
He's the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.495
You can't...

24:56.746 --> 24:58.540
He should have Elliot.

24:58.623 --> 24:59.791
Okay.

25:04.171 --> 25:05.547
Excuse me.

25:09.759 --> 25:13.138
I bought him the camera.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.640
It was a good camera.

25:15.724 --> 25:17.434
I asked a couple
of our freelance guys for help.

25:18.268 --> 25:19.561
I miss still photography.

25:20.979 --> 25:22.439
Though not so much lately.

25:27.903 --> 25:30.780
Philip, it's Don Keefer again.
You've got to call me. This is a problem.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.741
Tomorrow morning,
everyone's gonna be sourcing

25:32.824 --> 25:34.701
the WND story
that's sourcing you sourcing me.

25:34.784 --> 25:38.496
I have no idea if Simon Weingarden
would make a good solicitor general or not,

25:38.580 --> 25:39.539
or even if he's being considered.

25:39.623 --> 25:44.085
But he shouldn't have this stapled
to his resume just because I'm dry.

25:44.836 --> 25:47.881
Call me, please, at any of my numbers.
They'll put you through.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.382
What was that?

25:49.466 --> 25:50.800
(EXHALES)

25:57.098 --> 25:58.642
Anyway...

26:00.143 --> 26:01.811
- You're feeling rage.
- (SCOFFS)

26:02.604 --> 26:04.606
I'd love it if I was.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.983
I'd give anything to feel rage.

26:07.067 --> 26:10.237
It'd trump the humiliation
and I'd be able to get up.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.656
I think I live here now.

26:12.739 --> 26:16.284
What if I were able to promise you
that humiliation always turns into rage?

26:16.368 --> 26:17.619
How long does that conversion take?

26:18.411 --> 26:20.121
How long is the evolution?

26:20.205 --> 26:21.998
How long does it take to get
from the larva stage...

26:22.082 --> 26:24.417
- I fully understand what you're asking.
- How long does it take?

26:24.501 --> 26:25.585
I guess it depends.

26:26.878 --> 26:29.089
Like with Germany, it was 15 or 20 years.

26:29.172 --> 26:31.258
- Forget it.
- But Wile E. Coyote,

26:31.341 --> 26:33.510
you know, he

26:34.094 --> 26:36.012
has a fast turnaround. (CHUCKLING)

26:43.979 --> 26:45.522
I want to die.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.150
I know.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.611
WILL: <i>We've seen a host</i>
<i>of contentious women's issues</i>

26:51.695 --> 26:53.488
<i>in the news including this one...</i>

26:53.571 --> 26:57.117
As soon as you're done, I'm gonna need it
so I can post an unedited transcript.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.827
Martin, Tess.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.245
We're monitoring it. Help is on the way.

27:00.328 --> 27:02.122
You understand they want to
be able to raise awareness...

27:02.205 --> 27:03.915
No, I understand.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.756
I'll tell you what column I'd write.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.842
"What's wrong with sluts?"

27:14.467 --> 27:16.636
I don't think that's her point.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.514
It wasn't her point, but it's mine.

27:19.597 --> 27:23.184
Rush Limbaugh called a woman a slut.
It's not hard for me to get over that.

27:23.268 --> 27:25.061
But now I have to ask
what's wrong with sluts?

27:25.645 --> 27:28.857
That's a woman who has
a lot of casual sex with different guys.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.026
Why isn't that good as long
as everybody's safe?

27:31.318 --> 27:34.446
Because the country
is divided into people who like sex

27:34.529 --> 27:37.741
and people who are utterly creeped out by it.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.326
I'm one of the sex people.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.077
And I'm sure we're in the majority

27:41.161 --> 27:43.663
and I'm getting tired of having
to make a public bow to the minority

27:43.747 --> 27:46.666
by pretending I'm not really into sex.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.425
You need to switch to vodka.

27:56.634 --> 27:58.219
It's not as easy to smell

27:58.303 --> 28:00.972
and you're wearing
the same clothes as you were yesterday.

28:01.431 --> 28:04.893
- (SCOFFS) You think I'm drunk right now?
- Last night.

28:04.976 --> 28:05.977
Most nights.

28:08.271 --> 28:10.023
What I do when I leave here is none...

28:10.106 --> 28:11.649
I know.

28:15.028 --> 28:17.364
Limbaugh is not the interesting conversation.

28:17.447 --> 28:18.698
He was wrong.

28:18.782 --> 28:20.617
Sluts was the interesting conversation.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.206
We'll have it in five minutes.
Another five or six to cut and render it.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.666
- I need to know how much time.
- I'll find out.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.173
- Gary.
- Yeah?

28:38.426 --> 28:40.762
How long did it take you
to straighten out after Africa?

28:42.472 --> 28:44.015
I wasn't holding the kid.

28:46.476 --> 28:47.769
All right.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.981
<i>We live in a dangerous time for freedom.</i>

28:52.065 --> 28:54.526
<i>A time when it takes guts to speak out</i>
<i>for conservative values.</i>

28:54.609 --> 28:56.778
I'll grant you that it takes guts
to speak out about anything.

28:56.861 --> 28:58.571
<i>But does it take something extra...</i>

28:58.655 --> 29:01.574
It's about five minutes away,
and then we'll have to cut it down from 4:07.

29:01.658 --> 29:03.743
Okay. Just 20 to 25 seconds of the call.

29:03.827 --> 29:05.787
If we can't get it right on time,
we can always slide it to 10:00.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.080
- I want it for us.
- We may be squeezed.

29:07.163 --> 29:09.833
- Then we're squeezed.
- All right. We'll have it.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.459
<i>...or Mr. Buchanan.</i>

29:11.543 --> 29:13.878
<i>But Rush Limbaugh has</i>
<i>the most popular show on the radio</i>

29:13.962 --> 29:16.256
<i>and Pat Buchanan won</i>
<i>the New Hampshire primary.</i>

29:16.339 --> 29:19.092
What does someone who wants
to speak up about conservative values

29:19.175 --> 29:21.428
have to fear in terms of consequences?

29:21.511 --> 29:23.346
<i>Will, I'm not even sure</i>
<i>why we're talking about this.</i>

29:23.430 --> 29:25.557
It's because you said
it's a dangerous time for freedom.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.308
A time when it takes guts to speak out

29:27.392 --> 29:29.227
for conservative values,
and then I took it from there.

29:29.310 --> 29:31.980
<i>Pat Buchanan was fired from MSNBC.</i>

29:32.063 --> 29:33.773
- Do you know why?
<i>- I can take a guess.</i>

29:33.857 --> 29:35.775
Well, since you're on television,
I'd prefer you didn't.

29:35.859 --> 29:37.569
<i>It was absolutely because of the book.</i>

29:37.652 --> 29:38.695
I guess you couldn't help yourself.

29:39.070 --> 29:41.364
<i>You and I know</i>
<i>there's a chapter that's misunderstood.</i>

29:41.739 --> 29:43.158
Tess, I'll be back in a second.

29:43.241 --> 29:45.326
- Give him a warning at 30 out.
- Copy.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.329
<i>People widely misunderstood</i>
<i>a chapter in Pat's book.</i>

29:48.413 --> 29:50.790
<i>- The chapter...</i>
<i>- "The End of White America."</i>

29:50.874 --> 29:52.750
- Jesse?
- Yeah.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.085
I'm Mac McHale, the producer.

29:54.169 --> 29:56.212
That's such a news name.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.298
"Well, you got moxie, kid. And that's our lead.

29:58.381 --> 30:01.551
"Kill the lead that was there before
and get me a ham sandwich."

30:03.428 --> 30:04.929
So let me ask you a couple of things.

30:05.013 --> 30:07.015
You're the head of
the Rutgers Gay-Straight Alliance?

30:07.098 --> 30:08.725
- Yes.
- Did you know Tyler?

30:08.808 --> 30:09.934
No.

30:10.518 --> 30:13.646
Will's gonna ask you
about the reaction to all this on campus.

30:13.730 --> 30:15.732
You don't have to feel like
you're speaking for everyone,

30:15.815 --> 30:17.484
just your own experience.

30:17.567 --> 30:19.861
Obviously I thought
what Dharun Ravi did was reprehensible.

30:19.944 --> 30:22.155
He invaded Tyler's privacy
in the worst possible way

30:22.238 --> 30:24.157
and then made it available
for everyone to see.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.825
Do you think Dharun Ravi is homophobic?

30:25.909 --> 30:28.286
I have no idea. I know he's an asshole.

30:28.369 --> 30:30.330
You take the most intimate
moment of someone's life

30:30.413 --> 30:32.957
- and use it for entertainment?
- Right.

30:34.209 --> 30:35.668
Right.

30:36.836 --> 30:41.341
A woman who works for the <i>Post</i>
is mad at Will for a perceived snub

30:41.424 --> 30:44.427
and she's been tweeting about it
and that's why someone here

30:44.511 --> 30:47.430
was looking at the <i>News Night</i> hashtag.

30:48.389 --> 30:51.017
"Watch #Newsnight 8:00 p.m.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.020
"My TV debut. Gonna make some waves.

30:54.437 --> 30:58.066
"#Parentspleasedonthateme."

30:58.441 --> 31:00.026
This was you, right?

31:00.109 --> 31:01.611
Yeah. Just spreading the word.

31:02.070 --> 31:03.613
What kind of waves, Jesse?

31:06.866 --> 31:08.910
Are you planning on
coming out on the show?

31:11.621 --> 31:13.623
(SIGHS) To my parents.

31:14.415 --> 31:15.792
I'm sorry, you can't.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.043
Why?

31:18.002 --> 31:21.714
You just said you can't take
the most intimate moment of someone's life

31:21.798 --> 31:23.007
and use it for entertainment.

31:23.091 --> 31:24.467
But I'm volunteering to do that.

31:24.551 --> 31:25.802
- I signed a release.
- You can't do it.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.720
If I hadn't told you, you wouldn't have known.

31:27.804 --> 31:30.014
If you hadn't tweeted about it
and you hadn't told me,

31:30.098 --> 31:31.933
I wouldn't have known, but you did and I do.

31:32.016 --> 31:33.977
What's wrong with it?
As long as I'm okay with it.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.603
It's just not that kind of show.

31:35.687 --> 31:38.398
<i>- We'll be back after this.</i>
- What kind of show?

31:38.481 --> 31:40.775
The kind where that would happen.

31:40.858 --> 31:43.653
We just went to commercial
and I'll be right back.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.238
We have to talk about this, okay?

31:45.321 --> 31:48.199
- You can't just pretend I didn't say anything?
- No.

31:51.536 --> 31:54.622
She knew what she was doing when she said
you must have thought she was a waitress.

31:54.706 --> 31:56.332
- People are tweeting?
- Mostly women.

31:56.416 --> 31:59.002
- Mostly bad stuff?
- And Pepper Burke sent out another tweet.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.337
During the show?
I wish they'd wait until after.

32:01.421 --> 32:03.339
- Or at least a commercial.
- What's going on here?

32:03.423 --> 32:05.133
- She tweeted again.
- Yeah.

32:05.216 --> 32:07.594
And Miles Deaken pulled
my pigtails in kindergarten.

32:07.677 --> 32:10.430
- Could I...
- What was the second tweet?

32:11.681 --> 32:13.725
"Another battle lost in the war on women."

32:13.808 --> 32:16.352
And also on that metaphor.
Did you call his phone?

32:16.436 --> 32:18.229
- Yeah, there was no answer.
- You left a message?

32:18.313 --> 32:19.856
- I called the hospital.
- You left a message for him?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.399
- Yeah.
- Good.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.526
It's gonna mean a lot to him.

32:25.153 --> 32:26.613
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

32:26.696 --> 32:28.239
- Come on, do it, now.
- It's not that simple.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.741
- Yes, it is.
- After the show.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.701
I'm saying in addition you should call now,

32:31.784 --> 32:35.163
his phone, and leave a message.
Start to turn this around.

32:35.246 --> 32:36.456
I think I'm making a mistake

32:36.539 --> 32:38.458
not having Neal write
something to this woman.

32:38.541 --> 32:41.502
"It was a pleasure meeting you at lunch.
I'm sorry you felt snubbed."

32:41.586 --> 32:44.172
Yeah, but maybe it should be longer.
What else do you want to say?

32:44.255 --> 32:45.840
- "I had to hurry back to the office."
- What else?

32:46.090 --> 32:48.551
"I don't think any woman
with a coffee cup is a waitress.

32:48.635 --> 32:50.511
"I don't think women
are only suited to be waitresses."

32:50.595 --> 32:52.639
Are you sure you want to be
that insulting to waitresses?

32:52.722 --> 32:54.140
- You're right.
- Will.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.476
- Yeah?
- Forget about the fucking tweet!

32:56.559 --> 32:59.479
Look, I get that it's stupid, but it has an effect.

32:59.562 --> 33:01.439
And we haven't been getting
the bounces lately.

33:01.522 --> 33:03.274
And there's injustice.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.653
Living with that much injustice

33:06.736 --> 33:09.155
from the person
who was supposed to represent...

33:09.238 --> 33:11.658
He's the one who tells you
what the world is going to think of you.

33:11.741 --> 33:13.743
And if he tells you you're bad... That forever.

33:13.868 --> 33:16.788
Not forever. That's my point.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.500
- HERB ON HEADSET: <i>Thirty seconds.</i>
- Thirty seconds.

33:23.461 --> 33:25.463
If you're thinking
on the off chance he might die tonight,

33:25.546 --> 33:27.256
you can win the last frame
by sticking it to him...

33:27.340 --> 33:28.800
- I'm not.
- Then why are you talking about justice?

33:28.883 --> 33:30.843
- I don't know what to say.
- It's voice mail.

33:30.927 --> 33:32.720
"Dad, it's Will. I just heard..."

33:32.804 --> 33:35.014
I'll call him in the next break.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.476
What was the third tweet?

33:39.352 --> 33:40.853
The first was you blew her off

33:40.937 --> 33:42.897
and she's a waitress
and you didn't respond to that.

33:42.980 --> 33:45.733
And the second was the lost battle
and you didn't respond to that.

33:45.817 --> 33:47.777
What was the third?

33:48.861 --> 33:50.321
"You just lost a viewer."

33:53.616 --> 33:55.118
She knows what she's doing.

something late in the show.

34:20.143 --> 34:21.269

waiting to say something?

34:25.440 --> 34:26.441
I don't know.

Jerry Dantana was chasing a rumor here.
That's what he's supposed to do.

35:22.371 --> 35:26.417
I thought his profile was low enough
that he wouldn't set off any buzzers.

35:26.501 --> 35:27.919
What's the rumor?

35:28.002 --> 35:29.796
I can't tell you that.

- Don't you want me to wave you off?

- Really?
- I can't tell you what it is.

- I can't tell you.
- But it is, right?

35:45.686 --> 35:47.355
- Shep.
- It's a fucking serious allegation, Charlie.

35:47.438 --> 35:50.608
- Nobody's making the allegation.
- That's a war crime.

I mean, can you imagine?
People would go away for a long time.

35:55.404 --> 35:58.115
There'd be riots in the Middle East.
There'd be riots here at home.

35:58.866 --> 36:00.535
Our allies would be in a fix

36:00.618 --> 36:04.789

to moral authority around the world.

If your son were a Marine like you were

Isn't it time to change the public perception?

39:23.195 --> 39:24.864
If your son were the one in there,
wouldn't you do it?

39:24.947 --> 39:25.990
Wouldn't you insist it be done?

39:28.993 --> 39:30.327

I'm sorry and all,

- No.
- It's not?

40:08.491 --> 40:11.160
- It's not the right time.
- All right.

Because you don't know
they're like that until they are.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.331
But they are a lot with you and...

40:15.414 --> 40:17.083
There's no way to tell, Don.

40:17.166 --> 40:19.960
- I'm sorry. I don't believe that.
- You don't?

40:20.044 --> 40:22.254
I don't believe that someone
who is capable of this,

40:22.338 --> 40:24.757
that a shithead this big
is able to keep it a secret

40:24.840 --> 40:27.718
from someone they've been
dating for seven weeks.

40:27.843 --> 40:31.055
You're saying I knew he was like this,
but didn't care?

40:31.138 --> 40:34.100
I'm saying you don't have a very high opinion
of yourself and I don't get it.

40:35.017 --> 40:36.268
And since it's not the right time,

40:36.352 --> 40:38.104
let me also say
if it had been a woman who had done this,

40:38.187 --> 40:39.939
her friends would be saying, "You go, girl!"

40:40.022 --> 40:43.400
I promise you, he's getting that right now
from his friends in arbitrage.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.027
No.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.571
That's the difference.
Deep down, they think he's an asshole.

40:47.655 --> 40:49.073
He's an asshole right on top.

40:49.156 --> 40:50.950
No, they, his friends in arbitrage...

40:51.033 --> 40:53.369
Yeah, I know. I was making a joke.

40:53.702 --> 40:55.412
You're really...

41:00.209 --> 41:01.794
You're impressive.

41:05.381 --> 41:07.424
I have to make a phone call.

41:15.266 --> 41:16.976
- Did you call?
- I did. I called.

41:17.059 --> 41:18.769
- Did you really?
- I did.

41:20.563 --> 41:22.648
That was the right thing.

41:22.731 --> 41:26.110
You know it was the right thing
and you get to live with that now.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.404
And you're going to make
your father very happy

41:28.487 --> 41:30.072
when he gets the message.

41:30.573 --> 41:31.824
I know.

41:38.873 --> 41:41.876
So call me back at the office.
I'll be here until 11:30.

41:41.959 --> 41:44.086
Or you can call me on my cell anytime.

41:47.256 --> 41:49.341
I saw a guy named Philip Adams last night.

41:49.425 --> 41:51.802
Phil Adams.
He's well-connected in the acute caucus

41:51.886 --> 41:55.097
of the mental patient wing
of the exotic disorders extreme of the GOP,

41:55.181 --> 41:57.683
and we were talking
about Simon Weingarden and I asked Adams

41:57.766 --> 42:00.853
if he'd have any trouble getting confirmed
as solicitor general if the job opened.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.688
Like has he been paid to speak

42:02.771 --> 42:05.065
to The Righteous
Daughters of Jihadi Excellence or anything?

42:05.149 --> 42:06.525
- And due to my dry delivery...
- Are you kidding me?

42:06.609 --> 42:08.402
No, when I'm in the right mood,
I'm like Jack Benny.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.154
No, I'm talking about somebody ran it?

42:10.237 --> 42:13.407
WorldNetDaily. I've been calling Adams.
That was the third time.

42:13.490 --> 42:15.701
You've gotta call someone there.
You gotta call an editor.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.286
- Why haven't you done that?
- Why haven't I...

42:17.369 --> 42:18.370
- Called an editor.
- I guess I wasn't sure...

42:18.454 --> 42:19.955
- Does WorldNetDaily even have...
- Yes!

42:20.039 --> 42:21.415
Their names and numbers are in the database.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.876
This is gonna get out of control
and Weingarden's getting tagged.

42:24.084 --> 42:27.046
I can't be blamed for... I don't think...
How much do you think I can be blamed?

42:27.129 --> 42:28.756
All right, here's a senior editor.

42:32.134 --> 42:34.386
I'm calling a guy named Munch.

42:34.470 --> 42:36.388
I'm not gonna make it out of this call alive.

42:36.472 --> 42:39.183
- Put it on speaker.
- You can't laugh.

42:39.266 --> 42:42.436
How am I going to stop myself when
all I've been doing is laughing for hours?

42:52.404 --> 42:54.949
- MAN ON PHONE: <i>Hello?</i>
- Mr. Munch?

42:55.032 --> 42:58.077
The case took a turn today
when the part-time Mayor of Sanford,

42:58.160 --> 43:02.915
Jeff Triplett, overruled his police department
and released the 911 tape to the press.

43:03.165 --> 43:06.043
<i>We received the audio recording</i>
<i>just a few minutes ago,</i>

43:06.126 --> 43:08.128
<i>and we'll play a portion now.</i>

43:08.212 --> 43:12.424
ZIMMERMAN: <i>This guy looks like he's up to</i>
<i>no good or he's on drugs or something.</i>

43:12.508 --> 43:16.136
<i>It's raining and he's just</i>
<i>walking around looking about.</i>

43:16.595 --> 43:18.097
<i>He looks black.</i>

43:18.180 --> 43:19.181
DISPATCHER: <i>Did you see</i>
<i>what he was wearing?</i>

43:19.265 --> 43:20.307
ZIMMERMAN: <i>Yeah.</i>

43:20.391 --> 43:22.309
- I was just being hyperbolic.
- MUNCH ON PHONE: <i>Yeah?</i>

43:22.393 --> 43:24.979
I didn't think there was any way
I could be taken seriously.

43:25.062 --> 43:27.690
<i>Yeah, I can see that, but the thing is,</i>
<i>we've got it from multiple sources.</i>

43:27.773 --> 43:30.859
David, come on.
You got to take it down and run a retraction.

43:30.943 --> 43:34.571
<i>I appreciate you clarifying your role,</i>
<i>but like I said, you weren't the only one.</i>

43:34.655 --> 43:36.448
I was the only source. Come on now.

43:36.532 --> 43:38.784
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I appreciate being woken up and called a liar.</i>

43:38.867 --> 43:40.244
It's 8:45. Where do you live?

43:40.536 --> 43:42.162
<i>Let's say good night, Don.</i>

43:42.246 --> 43:44.790
My friend, I get that this story
is pushing traffic...

43:44.873 --> 43:45.958
<i>That has nothing...</i>

43:46.041 --> 43:49.128
...but Weingarden didn't do anything
except become a lawyer. So...

43:49.211 --> 43:51.922
<i>I'll tell you for the third time,</i>
<i>we have multiple sources telling us...</i>

43:52.006 --> 43:55.467
That he spoke to The Righteous
Daughters of Jihadi Excellence?

43:56.635 --> 43:59.096
<i>It turns out your joke was right on the money.</i>

44:03.183 --> 44:05.978
I made up the fucking name, David!

44:06.061 --> 44:09.481
There is no such thing
as The Righteous Daughters of the...

44:09.565 --> 44:11.650
What the fuck is wrong with you?

44:11.734 --> 44:13.861
- Did you search it?
<i>- I just did.</i>

44:13.944 --> 44:15.279
<i>There are 17 entries.</i>

44:15.362 --> 44:18.157
That's because of your story, fat-ass!

44:18.240 --> 44:20.576
<i>- Mr. Keefer, I think you're extremely...</i>
- (HANGS UP)

44:24.663 --> 44:27.249
Have Neal write this story
including this phone call

44:27.333 --> 44:28.834
and post it on our website tonight.

44:29.335 --> 44:31.253
Cut off the air supply to the morning shows.

44:32.838 --> 44:34.840
I think I'm done in here.

44:37.843 --> 44:38.927
Thanks, pal.

44:45.976 --> 44:50.022
WILL: <i>Here to speak with us tonight</i>
<i>is Nia Robbie, a lawyer for the NAACP.</i>

44:50.105 --> 44:52.524
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>either of us have heard that recording.</i>

44:52.608 --> 44:53.859
<i>What are your initial thoughts?</i>

44:53.942 --> 44:56.195
<i>I think it's pretty clear</i>
<i>this was racially motivated.</i>

44:56.278 --> 44:57.696
WILL: I don't think anything's clear.

44:57.780 --> 44:59.448
<i>"He's black. He's up to no good."</i>

44:59.531 --> 45:00.991
He's looking at all the houses.

45:01.075 --> 45:02.785
<i>His family says he may have</i>
<i>been listening to music</i>

45:02.868 --> 45:05.245
<i>on his iPhone and not even</i>
<i>aware Zimmerman was watching.</i>

45:05.329 --> 45:08.040
<i>His family would have no way</i>
<i>of knowing that, though, right?</i>

45:08.123 --> 45:09.958
<i>What they know,</i>
<i>what we know is that he was armed</i>

45:10.042 --> 45:12.002
<i>with a bag of Skittles</i>
<i>and some very dangerous iced tea.</i>

45:12.086 --> 45:13.087
Mac.

45:13.170 --> 45:15.297
WILL: <i>It's George Zimmerman</i>
<i>who gets the benefit of the doubt now.</i>

45:15.381 --> 45:16.965
NIA: <i>A benefit never afforded to Trayvon.</i>

45:17.049 --> 45:20.969
WILL: <i>Nia, Mr. Zimmerman claimed</i>
<i>that Trayvon Martin looked suspicious.</i>

45:21.053 --> 45:23.514
NIA: <i>That's right.</i>
WILL: <i>How does one look suspicious?</i>

45:23.597 --> 45:24.890
NIA: <i>You'd have to ask Mr. Zimmerman.</i>

45:24.973 --> 45:27.059
This is a helo manifest.

45:27.142 --> 45:28.519
From what?

45:29.895 --> 45:31.146
Operation Genoa.

45:33.232 --> 45:35.442
This is the first piece of paper
we've seen with that name.

45:36.693 --> 45:38.278
Listen,

45:38.821 --> 45:41.782
I sang in an a cappella group in college,
the Whiskey Sodas.

45:42.533 --> 45:46.328
When we'd tour, the secretary would have
to submit an expense report.

45:46.412 --> 45:50.374
We'd want to bring a ton of weed,
but we wanted the group to pay for it.

45:50.457 --> 45:54.253
So in the expense report,
instead of saying weed,

45:54.336 --> 45:56.213
it would say chickens.

45:56.672 --> 45:58.340
Look at the manifest.

46:01.552 --> 46:03.262
".50 cal ammunition.

46:03.345 --> 46:07.015
"M261 ffar 2.75 rocket pods.

46:07.099 --> 46:08.600
"MX-76."

46:09.226 --> 46:12.062
- What's MX-76?
- There's no such thing.

46:12.146 --> 46:13.564
I called three quartermasters.

46:13.647 --> 46:15.149
- It was the gas.
- Look...

46:15.232 --> 46:18.235
We dropped sarin. This is a true story.

46:19.736 --> 46:22.573
It happened and we're gonna prove it.

46:22.823 --> 46:24.032
Where'd you get this?

46:30.706 --> 46:31.915
Can I talk to you a second?

46:31.999 --> 46:34.209
- Yeah. Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

46:36.879 --> 46:39.006
I'm transcribing the full text of the 911 call.

46:39.089 --> 46:41.800
The 911 operator asks,
"Is he white, black, or Hispanic?"

46:41.884 --> 46:43.469
and Zimmerman answers, "He looks black."

46:43.552 --> 46:44.887
Yeah.

46:45.387 --> 46:46.972
You cut the operator's question.

46:49.641 --> 46:51.226
Yeah, but...

46:59.610 --> 47:01.612
Excuse me, I...

47:01.695 --> 47:04.072
(INAUDIBLE)

47:13.123 --> 47:14.583
Jesse.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.460
I'm sorry, I've got to bump the segment.

47:16.543 --> 47:17.794
- Why?
- We screwed up.

47:17.878 --> 47:20.380
We aired a badly edited tape
of George Zimmerman

47:20.464 --> 47:22.799
talking to the 911 operator
and I need the space

47:22.883 --> 47:24.551
so we can air the full tape
at the end of the show.

47:24.635 --> 47:26.094
Is this because I said I was coming out?

47:26.220 --> 47:28.555
- No.
- Because I was gonna come out on the air?

47:28.639 --> 47:30.516
No. I just told you the reason.

47:30.599 --> 47:32.601
I don't believe you.

47:33.143 --> 47:34.520
I guess I'm gonna have to live with that.

47:34.603 --> 47:36.188
People are gonna know about this.

47:36.271 --> 47:39.525
140-character public shaming
is absolutely in order,

47:39.608 --> 47:41.652
but make sure you blame it on Will and not me

47:41.735 --> 47:43.904
'cause Will's the famous one
and you'll want traction.

47:43.987 --> 47:45.239
Why are you acting like such a bitch?

47:52.371 --> 47:55.082
I was gonna lose the segment anyway
and it was 'cause you were gonna come out.

47:55.165 --> 47:57.793
If it makes you uncomfortable,
then maybe you should come to our meetings.

47:57.876 --> 48:00.879
You want to come out on TV, I don't care.
But you can't do it here.

48:00.963 --> 48:02.214
He's not Maury Povich.

48:02.297 --> 48:04.967
Tyler was robbed of his right to come out
to the world on his own terms.

48:05.092 --> 48:06.760
Dharun made that decision for him.

48:06.843 --> 48:09.179
I'm doing what Tyler
never had the chance to do.

48:09.263 --> 48:10.889
I'm taking the power back.

48:12.224 --> 48:14.560
Jesse, you're full of shit.

48:15.394 --> 48:17.229
You want to be a D-lister and that's it.

48:17.312 --> 48:18.730
You want to get onstage

48:18.814 --> 48:21.608
and you want to call him Tyler
even though you told me you didn't know him

48:21.692 --> 48:23.860
so you can bathe in his reflected tragedy.

48:25.153 --> 48:26.154
Fuck you, Jesse.

48:26.238 --> 48:28.740
That kid killed himself
because his privacy was stolen.

48:28.824 --> 48:31.994
And you think
you're honoring him by tweeting

48:32.077 --> 48:35.872
about coming out
in front of a million and a half strangers?

48:38.166 --> 48:41.587
I'll put up color bars
before I'll put you in front of our cameras.

48:44.715 --> 48:48.093
I thought it was one way
to tell my parents the news

48:48.176 --> 48:49.553
and not be there when I did.

48:53.307 --> 48:54.683
Well, good luck with that.

48:54.766 --> 48:56.018
Thanks.

48:57.019 --> 48:59.605
I saw a video online. It gets better.

48:59.688 --> 49:01.356
How would you know?

49:01.857 --> 49:03.734
I guess I wouldn't.

49:04.359 --> 49:05.360
Take it easy.

49:11.074 --> 49:15.370
I've known a few of these guys.
I know this one very well.

49:17.205 --> 49:20.959
Having a relationship
with an audience is cool. I get it.

49:21.043 --> 49:22.669
As long as it doesn't turn serious.

49:22.753 --> 49:25.172
As long as it's hooking up
and home before sunrise,

49:25.255 --> 49:27.633
then everything's fine 'cause...

49:28.508 --> 49:32.179
They don't feel about you
the way you want them to.

49:34.973 --> 49:38.101
You were gonna get killed. I did you a favor.

49:41.438 --> 49:44.441
WILL: <i>Sanford is a high crime area,</i>
<i>and this community in particular.</i>

49:44.524 --> 49:46.818
<i>Is it possible that</i>
<i>the extra motivation, as you said,</i>

49:46.902 --> 49:48.612
<i>pursuing Trayvon Martin on foot...</i>

NIA: <i>When the dispatcher</i>
<i>told him plainly not to.</i>

49:50.405 --> 49:51.782
WILL: <i>Isn't it possible that...</i>

49:51.865 --> 49:54.076
We're all set.
We wanted to wait for a commercial break.

49:54.159 --> 49:56.286
- That's them?
- Alim and Samirah Kouri.

49:58.246 --> 50:01.333
- Mr. Kouri?
- ALIM: <i>Yes, this is me. I'm here.</i>

50:01.416 --> 50:03.085
And, Mrs. Kouri, are you there?

50:03.168 --> 50:04.920
SAMIRAH: <i>I'm here. Is help coming</i>
<i>for my husband?</i>

50:05.003 --> 50:06.672
<i>Will you put this call on television?</i>

50:06.755 --> 50:07.839
Here's the thing, guys.

50:07.923 --> 50:10.467
Syrians don't commonly say, "Thank God."

50:10.550 --> 50:13.679
Nobody named Kouri is registered at the W.

50:13.762 --> 50:17.307
And when that building came down,
it took the cell tower with it.

50:19.935 --> 50:22.229
You still with me... Stewart?

50:22.312 --> 50:23.438

50:23.522 --> 50:25.649
We have software

and that's why your super
is knocking on your door

50:28.026 --> 50:29.653
right now with a police officer.

50:29.736 --> 50:32.656

<i>Could you open the door, please?</i>

50:33.323 --> 50:35.492

<i>- Nia Robbie, thank you for joining us.</i>
<i>- Thank you, Will.</i>

50:45.419 --> 50:46.586
<i>We'll be back after this.</i>

50:48.630 --> 50:50.674
You're not making
a rational expectations argument.

50:50.757 --> 50:54.386
I am. Expectations, insofar
as they're informed by predictions,

50:54.469 --> 50:56.263
are essentially...
Okay, look, if the prediction...

50:56.346 --> 50:58.223
All right, you're making
a rational expectations argument,

50:58.306 --> 50:59.433
but you're not being rational.

50:59.516 --> 51:01.977
There's no risk here.
What are we talking about?

51:02.060 --> 51:04.771
It's not pure, frictionless arbitrage.

51:04.855 --> 51:07.065
Excuse me. I'm so sorry to interrupt.

51:07.149 --> 51:09.192
Hey, Sloan. You in the neighborhood?

51:09.276 --> 51:11.319
Always. I work a block over.

51:11.403 --> 51:12.821
Cathy told me to come back.

51:13.113 --> 51:15.031
Scott, can we talk for just one second?

51:15.323 --> 51:16.533
I'll have him right back.

51:20.328 --> 51:21.955
Excuse me.

<i>200 hail reports from Missouri to Alabama,</i>

51:56.031 --> 51:58.450
<i>including baseball-sized hail</i>
<i>in Carrollton, Illinois.</i>

51:58.533 --> 52:00.076
What happened?

52:00.786 --> 52:03.622
Jim, I swear to God it was for time.

52:03.705 --> 52:05.707
- You didn't hear it and think...
- I had to cut it down to 25.

52:05.791 --> 52:07.959
You didn't hear it and think,
"If I take out the question

52:08.043 --> 52:09.711
- "and only leave the answer"...
- I know.

52:09.795 --> 52:11.922
- ..."it won't sound like it was an answer"?
- I didn't.

52:12.005 --> 52:14.966
If I had, I would have...
Obviously I wouldn't have cut it...

52:15.300 --> 52:17.886
- It was just for time?
- Yes.

52:20.096 --> 52:22.432
You weren't trying to see justice done?

52:25.143 --> 52:26.728
I had one pass.

52:27.062 --> 52:28.939
I was hearing it for the first time.

52:29.022 --> 52:31.775
And I'm not sure I need to be disciplined by
a guy who gave away an interview,

52:31.858 --> 52:33.777
'cause that happened, Jim,
that's what you did.

52:33.860 --> 52:36.488
You wanted to save Hallie,
so you gave away our interview.

52:36.571 --> 52:38.907
And watching you defend
that column when you know...

52:48.041 --> 52:52.712
I had six minutes to cut a five-minute
piece of audio down to 25 seconds.

52:54.214 --> 52:58.343
I should have been listening for it.
I know what 911 calls sound like. I just...

52:59.052 --> 53:01.304
I never remotely prepared for this scenario.

53:07.060 --> 53:08.687
- Look...
- The thing is,

53:08.770 --> 53:12.566
I'm afraid to sleep alone at night,
so sometimes I go out.

53:13.149 --> 53:14.609
That's all.

53:14.860 --> 53:17.028
That's all it is. That's all.

53:22.534 --> 53:23.702
Yeah.

53:29.875 --> 53:33.128
- All right, you apologize, but make it brief.
- Yeah.

53:33.211 --> 53:35.338
- A mea culpa isn't really right.
- I agree.

53:35.422 --> 53:38.425
The full audiotape is 4:07
and we're gonna play it right through

53:38.508 --> 53:41.344
and you should point out
the specific mistake that was made.

53:41.428 --> 53:44.306
- You want an intro on the prompter?
- No, I'm good.

53:45.223 --> 53:49.102
After the show, I'm gonna tell you about
the Bonnie and Clyde of prank callers.

53:49.185 --> 53:50.729
Okay. How's Sloan?

53:50.812 --> 53:52.105
She's gonna be fine.

53:52.188 --> 53:55.233
She scratched herself for tonight,
but I just saw she's back in Don's rundown.

53:55.317 --> 53:56.318
Good.

53:58.403 --> 54:00.196
According to a number of Internet sources,

54:00.280 --> 54:03.617
men your dad's age
have a full recovery rate of 93%.

54:03.700 --> 54:07.454
- So especially knowing your father...
- He died. My father died.

54:09.331 --> 54:11.833
- What did you say?
- He died.

54:12.334 --> 54:15.503
He had... It's called a ventricular fibrillation.

54:17.797 --> 54:18.840
When?

54:19.633 --> 54:21.551
About 10 minutes ago.

54:21.885 --> 54:24.095
Twelve. The last break.

54:24.179 --> 54:26.640
I called to leave a message
when I said I was gonna

54:26.723 --> 54:28.892
and my sister answered his phone.

54:29.809 --> 54:32.687
- You've been sitting here...
- It's all right.

54:33.188 --> 54:35.148
- Will.
- It really is all right.

54:36.858 --> 54:38.526
HERB ON HEADSET: <i>Mac, we're up.</i>

54:42.656 --> 54:44.991
All right. Here we go.

54:54.584 --> 54:55.835
(DOOR CLOSES)

54:57.629 --> 54:59.965
- HERB: In 10. Ready graphics 44 and 45.
- Ready.

55:03.927 --> 55:07.013
HERB: In five, four, three...

55:19.901 --> 55:21.069
Will.

55:23.279 --> 55:24.698
Will, we're back on you.

55:27.075 --> 55:29.160
- Go to commercial.
- We don't have one. This is the F block.

55:29.244 --> 55:30.286
Is Terry ready in D.C.?

55:30.370 --> 55:32.455
Control, this is New York.
Is Terry at the desk?

55:32.539 --> 55:33.540
<i>No.</i>

55:36.918 --> 55:38.169
<i>Will.</i>

55:45.093 --> 55:47.470
Well, I guess it's just us now.

55:52.267 --> 55:55.395
<i>We have an important correction</i>
<i>in the Trayvon Martin story.</i>
