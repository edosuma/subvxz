00:02.160 --> 00:03.491
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.680 --> 00:04.841
So my brother's a Ghost.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.610
Ten years ago,
I found out you were dealing.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.121
Yeah. You convinced me to enlist.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.488
You saw what kind of man my brother was,
what kind of man he is.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.682
He's your family.
You said he was a good man.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.803
- Maybe a part of him still is.
- I don't know.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.560
The damage to her spinal cord,
it's permanent.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.330
<i>She's never gonna walk again.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:29.327
If we don't get home soon,

00:29.520 --> 00:31.329
the sitter's gonna charge us
an extra hour.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.205
We should have taken the car.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.689
Sitter's what, another 15 bucks
for half an hour?

00:37.760 --> 00:39.842
It's a bargain at twice the price.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.487
Lyla.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.647
Dear God.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.285
- Alan.
- Sorry to crash your evening.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.806
Then don't. Just call like normal people.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.490
I don't have a normal job.

00:50.680 --> 00:51.966
And I've been compromised.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.241
I'm not A.R.G.U.S. anymore.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.090
Which makes you the only person
I can trust.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.321
I need you to tell Waller...

00:56.520 --> 00:57.567
Get down!

01:00.440 --> 01:01.441
You're hit.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.807
No!

01:04.040 --> 01:05.087
Alan!

01:18.280 --> 01:20.647
Johnnie!

01:21.680 --> 01:23.045
Are you okay?

01:23.240 --> 01:25.925
You were right.
We should've taken the car.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.491
Just be careful. Slow down, slow down.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.091
Careful, careful, careful...

01:36.360 --> 01:37.850
Do you want me to be careful?

01:38.240 --> 01:39.844
Oh, this is more Oliver 2.0, isn't it?

01:40.040 --> 01:41.724
You think being cute
is going to distract me?

01:42.400 --> 01:43.526
Mission accomplished.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.406
You don't have to wait on me
hand and foot.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.684
Though I wouldn't say no to a blanket.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.722
The doctor says
stick with the two tablets,

01:54.240 --> 01:58.086
keep with your current
pain management regimen.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.810
You know, I really appreciate
what you're doing,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.287
but you have a city to save,
a mayoral campaign,

02:02.480 --> 02:05.404
a freaky super-bad
who can move things with his mind.

02:05.640 --> 02:09.610
None of which are nearly as important
as your recovery. Thank you.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.039
I think the people in the city

02:11.240 --> 02:13.049
that Darhk wants to destroy
might disagree.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.129
Well, those people should know
that I stand no chance

02:15.360 --> 02:17.010
of stopping Damien Darhk
without your help.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.651
Well, you might have to.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.809
I have a spinal cord injury.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.243
I might never make a full recovery ever.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.601
That is worst case scenario.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.202
And either way, you're still
a vital member of the team.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.641
Your superpower is right there.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.284
Maybe my new codename could be Hot Wheels.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.370
Keep pitching on that.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.167
All jokes aside, like you said,

02:43.360 --> 02:44.930
what I do bring to the team is my mind

02:45.120 --> 02:47.168
and there's a lot on it.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.327
So talk to me.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.528
I just don't think I'm ready
to come back yet,

02:50.720 --> 02:53.963
and the last thing you need
in a life or limb situation is me.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.886
Wow. We are going to agree to
disagree on that one for the moment.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.847
What's going on?

03:01.040 --> 03:02.246
John and Lyla were attacked.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.407
Oh, my God, are they okay?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.250
John was shot. Flesh wound.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.527
I should go see them.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.801
We should go see them.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.601
Nice try.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.489
Dinner is in the fridge.
Reheat in the oven at 425 degrees.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.887
I love you.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.241
I love you, too.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.771
And they just left you there?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.769
Yeah, but not before
leaving me with this.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.088
We are sure that this wasn't HIVE?

03:30.280 --> 03:31.645
These men looked military.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.161
Right. But you said
that Chang said he was compromised

03:34.400 --> 03:36.482
and he specifically told you
to go and speak with Waller.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.967
Knowing her, she had Alan
working on something off the books.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.610
- I need to call the sitter.
- Okay.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.168
We need to find Chang before this
kidnapping becomes something worse.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.124
Yeah, well, the van didn't have
any plates on it.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.290
And Chang's phone is A.R.G.U.S.-issued,
which means it'll be untraceable.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.130
We could really use Felicity's help
right now.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.210
Yeah, she's not up for it yet.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.808
I can have SCPD see if John's bullet
is connected to any open cases.

03:59.000 --> 03:59.967
Yeah.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.925
I can go check the crime scene
for any leftover evidence.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.411
You should go to Starling General
and have that looked at.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.130
<i>- I'll be fine.
- Why?</i>

04:09.320 --> 04:11.288
Because eating a cheeseburger
is a better option?

04:11.520 --> 04:12.965
This isn't for me.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.207
It's for Andy.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.051
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.128
Hey, what happened to your arm?

04:25.720 --> 04:27.131
Nothing. It's occupational hazard.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.766
Right. I never pegged you
for the masked vigilante type.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.281
Yeah, well, I guess
we're both full of surprises, Andy.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.850
You know what?

04:36.360 --> 04:39.330
You keep coming down here
asking me all these questions,

04:39.520 --> 04:41.204
but I never get to ask them back.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.888
- What do you wanna know?
- All right.

04:46.680 --> 04:51.004
How do you end up working
out of a basement or wherever we are,

04:51.200 --> 04:54.363
and fighting crime with a guy
who wears a green hoodie?

04:54.600 --> 04:57.683
Well, he's a good man.
And we're not fighting crime, Andy.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.809
We're taking a city that's holding
itself together and we are helping.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.890
Don't you remember
when that was your mission?

05:11.720 --> 05:13.848
Appreciate you two volunteering
for this mission.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.481
A chance to ride with my little brother?
Wouldn't miss it.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.047
Yeah, Taliban's not ready
for the Diggle brothers.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.323
HQ's got eyes on a primo opium shipment

05:21.520 --> 05:22.885
that's been funding the local arms trade.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.127
We cut them off,

05:24.320 --> 05:26.891
the terrorists will be left with nothing
but rocks and sticks to fight us.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.969
Copy that, sir. You ready for this?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.249
Incoming. Stay frosty, boys.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.441
Copy that.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.681
RPG!

06:09.280 --> 06:10.964
- Perimeter!
- Go!

06:13.240 --> 06:15.447
Go, go! Move, move, move!

06:16.240 --> 06:18.891
We're screwed if they come around
from the other side.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.806
I'll see if I can buy us some time.
Move, move, move.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.767
I can draw them to it.

06:25.960 --> 06:26.961
Got your back.

06:42.440 --> 06:43.521
Come on. Come on. Come on!

06:43.720 --> 06:44.721
It's in.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.681
Screw this!

06:47.920 --> 06:48.887
Andy!

06:49.080 --> 06:50.161
Hey!

06:57.880 --> 06:58.881
(And)'-

07:00.040 --> 07:01.485
Talk to me, man. You okay?

07:02.400 --> 07:03.447
Did we get them?

07:04.080 --> 07:05.605
You got 'em, brother. Let's go.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.210
<i>Aww, why didn't I get invited
to this pity party?</i>

07:33.800 --> 07:35.484
Hello?

07:35.720 --> 07:37.848
<i>At least you found the right party favors.</i>

07:38.040 --> 07:41.567
<i>Three pills is a bit much,
but who am I to judge?</i>

07:41.760 --> 07:42.761
Okay, whoever you are,

07:42.960 --> 07:45.406
you picked the wrong woman
on the wrong night to mess with.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.888
<i>Please. We both know
you're in no position to do anything.</i>

07:49.200 --> 07:51.646
<i>If you did you'd be back out in
the world instead of holed up here.</i>

07:51.840 --> 07:55.242
Oh, my God. What is going on?

07:55.520 --> 07:59.206
What is going on? Oh, my God.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.324
Oh, my God, lam losing it.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.931
I am completely and utterly losing it. Oh!

08:04.400 --> 08:06.084
Now I am talking to myself.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.001
<i>Not exactly.</i>

08:14.240 --> 08:17.244
Laurel Lance, District Attorney's Office.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.287
What do we have here?

08:19.480 --> 08:22.051
Deceased male. Around 35. Asian.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.891
Multiple lacerations, contusions
and blunt force trauma.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.445
You canvass the area yet?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.369
There could be a witness
who saw something.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.722
I don't need an ADA
to tell me how to do my job.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.409
Well, I'm sure
there's a murderer out there

08:33.600 --> 08:35.602
who appreciates your lack of initiative.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.326
Go ahead.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.280
Private security found him
at the start of the graveyard shift.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.290
That's Chang.
Whoever did this took their time.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.131
Multiple lacerations to the knees,
a broken arm,

08:56.320 --> 08:58.800
at least three pulled fingernails.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.286
They were torturing him for something.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.680
Information wasn't the only thing
they wanted.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.725
I told you, what Agent Chang
was working on is none of your concern.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.126
It's even less of yours.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.327
Thought that would change
once you found out

09:16.520 --> 09:18.284
that Chang was mutilated,
tortured and killed.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.131
I'm afraid you've over-extended
your welcome, Mr. Diggle.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.163
Which is A.R.G.U.S.-speak
for "get the hell out of here."

09:23.360 --> 09:25.408
You always were a quick study.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.362
I mean this with all sincerity,
your presence has truly been missed.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.128
Even if I don't show it, I am deeply
regretful for Mr. Chang's death.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.050
Hopefully we'll meet again
under happier circumstances.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.686
Of course.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.648
Hey, what was that look all about?

09:56.040 --> 09:58.327
"Ketorolac. Possible side effects
include swelling of hands and feet,"

09:58.520 --> 10:00.010
"increased appetite, risk of infection..."

10:00.240 --> 10:01.765
Oh. Good, good, good. "Hallucinations."

10:01.960 --> 10:04.361
I really thought I was smarter than this.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.769
You are not me
and you're definitely not real.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.810
I used to be you. Or you used to be me.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.487
Strong, confident, brunette.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.125
But you wasted all that away
to go play super-hero.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.208
And look where that got you.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.680
Okay, so wait, this Waller person said
that she couldn't tell you anything

10:29.880 --> 10:31.325
and then gave you that flash drive?

10:31.560 --> 10:33.881
A.R.G.U.S. has 24/7 internal surveillance.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.526
She didn't want anyone to know
she was giving me what she was giving me.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.882
The question is, what did she give you?

10:40.520 --> 10:41.681
I've seen that symbol before.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.211
<i>It's</i> a <i>logo, actually.</i>

10:43.400 --> 10:45.323
Shadowspire is a US Army
Special Forces unit.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.729
A.R.G.U.S. took them down three years ago
when they were exposed as war profiteers.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.371
In an op run by Alan Chang.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.005
What about those other two guys?

10:52.200 --> 10:53.929
<i>They've been reported missing
for two days.</i>

10:54.120 --> 10:56.361
If those were the missing agents
that were part of Shadowspire...

10:56.560 --> 10:59.882
Then the rest of Shadowspire's
gonna be on a payback mission.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.560
We need to find the other two agents
before they end up like Alan.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.207
Hey, I think I found something.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.562
That logo that was on the flash drive
that Waller gave you.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.727
Shadowspire.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.081
Thought I recognized that from some place.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.770
I ran into a lot of those guys
back in the 'Stan.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.770
I need to talk to my brother again.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.926
You wouldn't think the reward
for confiscating an opium shipment

11:18.120 --> 11:19.929
would be additional duty guarding it.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.407
What'd you expect?
A kiss from the President?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.329
How are my two conquering heroes?

11:25.520 --> 11:28.171
- Wet and tired.
- We are good, sir.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.362
- You gentlemen did good today.
- Thank you, sir.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.642
You ever think of your future
beyond working in this hell hole?

11:32.840 --> 11:36.003
I don't know.
Personal security, body guarding maybe?

11:36.840 --> 11:38.649
You boys are meant for better things.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.841
The three of us could make bank if a few
bricks of that sweet Afghani powder

11:45.040 --> 11:47.771
happened to go AWOL before the morning.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.041
You know, I'm gonna have to decline, sir.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.891
My mama taught me
never to trust dirty war profiteers.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.324
You should probably watch your tone.

12:03.480 --> 12:06.165
You might end up in worse shape
than those Talis yesterday.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.286
As you were.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.407
- Well, look at you.
- What you talking about?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.409
Back in Starling,
you would have jumped at any opportunity

12:21.600 --> 12:23.568
to earn a little extra scratch.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.283
This place has been good for you.
Proud of you, Andy.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.729
So exactly how many evil organizations
are you associated with?

12:32.920 --> 12:33.967
I'm beginning to lose count.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.446
What are you talking about?

12:36.840 --> 12:39.844
Shadowspire. Your old army buddies
are in Starling City.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.366
They tortured and killed an A.R.G.U.S.
agent and abducted two others.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.562
Look, I have nothing to do
with them anymore.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.043
After I get discharged, they cut ties.
They only want enlisted men.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.086
How the hell could I not see this?
You were with me the entire time!

12:56.280 --> 12:58.647
Because you saw what you wanted to see!

12:58.880 --> 13:01.645
Look, you wanted to believe
that the Army had straightened me out.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.929
Look, I'm your brother,
but I'm not built like you.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.009
I didn't take to the military
like you did.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.202
You saw the world
as something to be fixed.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.164
I only saw it as broken.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.170
So I made sure
I had enough to survive in it.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.328
So you pretended to be
a completely different person

13:18.560 --> 13:19.607
around your own brother?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.448
Spare me the look
that's on your face right now.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.525
But maybe some good
could come out of this.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.881
(And)'-

13:31.560 --> 13:32.686
What are you talking about?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.247
Two missing agents.
You still think they're alive?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.647
- I can hope.
- And I can help.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.968
Look, I know how Shadowspire operates.

13:40.880 --> 13:41.881
If they're consistent,

13:42.080 --> 13:44.242
they'll use the nearest free port
as a base of operations.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.525
The best place to hide illicit things
is right next to legitimate ones.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.241
<i>"SPARTAN". It's called a free port.</i>

13:54.440 --> 13:57.364
Holds commodities while they're in transit
between international destinations.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.567
Pretty low-end.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.922
Looks like somebody
upgraded their security system.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.647
Motion sensors, laser trip wires,
digital locks.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.002
I think I know somebody who can help.

14:11.480 --> 14:14.689
Not gonna get that? Smart move.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.767
Oliver?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.764
<i>I'm out in the field, actually.</i>

14:21.120 --> 14:22.360
We've come up against some tech.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.170
The kind that you typically eat
for breakfast.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.603
Now, I know that you said you're not
ready to get back in the saddle,

14:27.800 --> 14:29.450
<i>but we could really use your help.</i>

14:29.600 --> 14:31.887
You're not really falling for that again,
are you?

14:32.120 --> 14:33.167
Where are you?

14:33.840 --> 14:35.205
Pacific Freeport, it's a...

14:35.440 --> 14:36.441
Security's down.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.281
That was amazing.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.289
<i>All you need to do
is to get back in the game.</i>

14:40.520 --> 14:42.966
I thought "vomiting inside my mouth"
was just an expression.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.200
I'm inside their security system.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.687
I got eyes on seven
very menacing-looking fellows

14:48.880 --> 14:50.962
<i>guarding a bunch of holding containers.</i>

14:55.400 --> 14:58.244
Reading infrared in one of the containers.
I'm working on opening that lock.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.323
Go for the hostages.
We'll take care of Shadowspire.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.885
Container's open.
Should be 10 feet in front of you,

15:10.080 --> 15:11.366
second container on your right.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.001
Got it.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.851
We found the two A.R. G. U. S. agents.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.161
They're both dead.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.004
- Get out of here then.
- What about you and Spartan?

15:24.160 --> 15:25.207
We got this! Go!

15:33.840 --> 15:34.841
Felicity, what's going on?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.526
I don't know. l...
I must have tripped some sort of failsafe.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.688
The system's overloaded
with too many requests.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.841
Oopsie.

15:54.360 --> 15:58.365
You hear so much about these vigilantes,
but I've never seen one in person.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.642
Wish I could say the same
about a cold-blooded murderer.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.361
Have we met before?

16:13.320 --> 16:14.321
Let's go.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.403
<i>I've got Spartan. We're good.</i>

16:17.080 --> 16:18.730
No thanks to you.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.801
Hey-

16:32.760 --> 16:33.761
You Okay?

16:33.920 --> 16:36.446
That depends. ls John okay?

16:36.680 --> 16:38.091
John's fine.

16:39.680 --> 16:43.651
But you seem to think that
what happened tonight is your fault.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.445
Well, I'm pretty sure I was the one

16:45.640 --> 16:47.529
who couldn't stop the security doors
from closing.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.921
And I'm the one who pushed you
to get involved

16:49.080 --> 16:51.287
when you signaled pretty hard
that you weren't ready.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.084
I wasn't signaling

16:54.200 --> 16:55.281
that hard.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.444
I'm sorry that I pushed.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.446
I just thought
that if you got behind a keyboard again,

17:01.600 --> 17:04.171
that things would just start
to feel normal.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.965
I love how playing super-hero
is what we consider normal.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.286
Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.968
But there is no going back to normal.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.487
- You know what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.967
What I mean is that
I can no longer be a part of the team.

17:19.960 --> 17:23.851
Because of your injury?
You can't let that stop you.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.644
Except it has.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.123
Look at me, Oliver.

17:28.319 --> 17:31.324
I've spent the last week and a half
stuck in this loft.

17:32.840 --> 17:36.970
I can't move, I can't drive, I can't walk
down the street and get a cup of coffee.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.970
And if tonight is any indication,

17:40.200 --> 17:43.488
I can't do the one thing
that I'm supposed to still be able to do.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.801
You just need to give it time.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.006
Hey, talk to me.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.847
Go ahead, tell him.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.840
Tell him you're hallucinating.
That should go over like gangbusters.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.764
I'm not going to pretend
that I understand...

18:00.000 --> 18:01.161
Come on, Felicity, tell him.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.327
<i>What you're going through.</i>

18:02.560 --> 18:04.927
Tell him that you're no good
for the team anymore.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.003
That in addition
to having legs that don't work,

18:07.160 --> 18:09.162
you've got a full on case of the crazies.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.165
<i>- We don't stand</i> a chance to <i>take down...
- Hearing voices, seeing visions...</i>

18:12.360 --> 18:13.850
Would you just shut up!

18:18.520 --> 18:20.284
- I didn't mean that.
- I didn't mean to upset you.

18:20.520 --> 18:21.851
No, no, no, it's not you, it's not you.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.043
Can I just be alone for a little while?

18:37.440 --> 18:40.364
You know, I guessed I hoped
by giving you intel on Shadowspire,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.727
you would let me out of my cell.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.882
But this isn't what I had in mind.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.964
Hey, Lyla. It's been a while.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.201
(And)'-

18:54.600 --> 18:57.046
Mr. Diggle. I'm the director of A.R.G.U.S.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.770
Those three dead men were my agents.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.043
I wanna debrief you
on your relationship to Shadowspire.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.247
Which is interesting

19:03.440 --> 19:05.442
because you couldn't even
say "Shadowspire" last time we met.

19:05.640 --> 19:09.884
I was taking an understandable precaution
in light of a potential security breach.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.967
The two agents you found tonight
were assigned

19:13.160 --> 19:15.561
to safeguard a shipment
of confiscated railguns.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.249
But that was a completely
black assignment.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.128
So I'd be very interested to know
how Shadowspire knew about it.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.762
Amanda, you don't see
the bigger problem here?

19:27.920 --> 19:30.241
Those things fire off
electromagnetic projectiles.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.970
Just one of them
could take down a building.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.127
Your point?

19:33.320 --> 19:35.846
My point is that if Shadowspire's
looking for that type of ordnance...

19:36.080 --> 19:38.765
I'm far more concerned
with a catastrophic security breach

19:38.920 --> 19:40.763
in my organization, Mr. Diggle.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.286
<i>"ANDY". It doesn't matter.</i>

19:43.280 --> 19:44.930
Shadowspire's not after railguns.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.281
And what if you're wrong, Andy?

19:46.440 --> 19:48.442
We thought you weren't hooked up
with Shadowspire anymore.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.007
I'm not. But I know the way they work.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.601
Shadowspire is all about misdirection.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.370
An elite military unit?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.170
A cover for a criminal organization.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.806
A heist of a shipment of railguns?

20:03.600 --> 20:06.285
No. Distraction.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.124
They're after something else.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.121
You wanna talk about it?

20:17.360 --> 20:18.486
What is there to talk about?

20:18.640 --> 20:21.723
Felicity's upset,
I don't know how to help her,

20:21.960 --> 20:24.327
it seems entirely straightforward.

20:24.720 --> 20:28.247
As the only other person here
who's had the privilege of dating you,

20:28.480 --> 20:29.481
a piece of advice?

20:29.680 --> 20:31.011
Okay.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.011
Don't be so hard on yourself.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.009
Everything that's happening is my fault.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.685
I knew you were gonna say that.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.561
Last month, when we went up
against Vandal Savage,

20:41.840 --> 20:44.525
Barry traveled through time
and changed things.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.842
- What?
- Barry can travel through time.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.607
And he warned me
that when you change the past,

20:50.840 --> 20:52.001
the past fights back.

20:52.160 --> 20:57.166
So for the past month,
I have been tortured by the idea

20:59.520 --> 21:01.682
that what happened to Felicity
might have happened

21:01.840 --> 21:02.841
because I wouldn't listen to him.

21:03.040 --> 21:06.681
The only person who is responsible
for what happened to Felicity

21:06.840 --> 21:07.921
is Damien Darhk.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.930
John. We're on it.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.971
John thinks Shadowspire's going after
a shipment of railguns.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.043
- Can you call Thea?
- Got it.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.041
Hey, Oliver.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.200
Felicity, she makes her own choices,
you know.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.727
And I'm sure that's one of the reasons
why you love her so much.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.924
<i>Wow. The Shining.</i>

21:43.120 --> 21:46.602
Not sure if I should be flattered,
or insulted.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.168
Oh, my God! God, just go away already.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.401
Since I'm you,

21:51.800 --> 21:53.404
that could be a little difficult,
don't you think?

21:54.400 --> 22:00.089
Fine. I'm here. You're here.
So why are we here?

22:00.240 --> 22:02.083
Do you have anything
the least bit interesting to say to me

22:02.240 --> 22:03.651
besides these little jabs you keep making?

22:03.920 --> 22:06.241
Well, those jabs
were just to get your attention.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.771
So what do you wanna tell me?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.607
I'm not here to tell you anything.
I'm here to show you.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.764
The last time we looked like this,
Cooper had just fake died.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.485
What does this have to do
with my ex-boyfriend?

22:17.680 --> 22:19.603
The day we thought he died,

22:19.920 --> 22:25.927
you broke out the hair dye,
ditched the contacts and decided

22:26.680 --> 22:30.526
you weren't gonna rely on anyone else
for help ever again.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.762
It was just going to be you
against the world,

22:32.920 --> 22:34.763
and that was going to be your armor.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.530
Guess I should've chosen Kevlar.

22:36.760 --> 22:40.367
Stop it. Stop feeling sorry for yourself!
And stop pretending!

22:40.600 --> 22:44.127
- Pretending?
- Pretending that this is the real you.

22:44.320 --> 22:48.609
The blonde hair, glasses,
sensible fashion.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.963
People wear masks for a reason.
To hide who they are.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.640
Just like you have been doing
for the past five years.

22:54.960 --> 22:58.646
First you decided to sign up for being
the world's most overqualified IT girl,

22:58.800 --> 23:01.644
and then you decide to try being a hero.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.481
And look what it got you.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.642
<i>A ringside seat to the rest of your life.</i>

23:09.320 --> 23:10.970
You thought you were such a badass.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.890
So Waller says the shipment of railguns
is in the back of that truck.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.844
Moving out in less than an hour.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.243
What does Shadowspire want
with a whole shipment of railguns?

23:29.160 --> 23:30.889
Absolutely nothing good.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.686
It's nice to have you back,
Agent Michaels.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.205
Feels like old times.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.686
What feels like old times

23:37.840 --> 23:40.525
is you keeping secrets
that get good people killed.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.843
Did it ever occur to you that Alan and
the other two agents might still be alive

23:44.040 --> 23:47.362
if you hadn't tried to keep your
anti-Shadowspire operations off the books?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.005
Of course it has.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.289
But the ugly side of our business
is that sometimes

23:51.520 --> 23:53.363
security has to be paid for in blood.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.446
Thank you. I was wondering why I'd left.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.531
I don't know
what you're worried about, man.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.091
Your team's not seeing action tonight.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.726
Yeah, and I'm not with them
because I'm here babysitting you.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.961
Where are they?

24:11.920 --> 24:12.967
Something's wrong.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.880
There's no movement on the railgun...

24:39.480 --> 24:41.721
Put your hands up! On your head now!

24:42.960 --> 24:44.007
Don't do it!

24:53.760 --> 24:56.650
Amanda. It's been ages.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.129
Lieutenant Joyner.
Wish I could say it was a pleasure.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.966
C'mon, man, stop moving.
You are making me dizzy.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.921
Oh, my God.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.281
I told you, John.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.161
The railguns were a distraction.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.203
A.R.G.U.S. is the endgame.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.686
If this is retribution for the work Agent
Chang and I did crippling Shadowspire,

25:30.960 --> 25:32.450
clearly it didn't take.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.805
Vengeance and retribution
are useless pursuits.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.207
For one thing, they don't pay.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.131
I'm here for Rubicon.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.281
And you, you're gonna give me
the codes to access it.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.646
You know I can't do that.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.281
I do.
That's why I kept all these people alive.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.040
(%GUNSHOTS) %GROANS)

25:53.880 --> 25:55.370
I'm gonna give you 20 minutes.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.201
And then,

26:01.320 --> 26:02.810
I'm gonna ask you again.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.486
Damn it. They must havejammers in here.
No cell or Wi-Fi service.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.164
Uh, would you like to share
with the rest of the class?

26:13.320 --> 26:16.767
These monitors work just like TVs.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.322
Receiving broadcast signals
from the 700 MHz band.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.050
I have a friend who's into
this kind of stuff.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.605
Occasionally, I listen to her.

26:25.840 --> 26:30.164
If I can just switch the chipset
into transmitting mode,

26:31.680 --> 26:33.364
I should be able to contact my team.

26:33.560 --> 26:37.007
Oh, man, Lyla does not have time to wait
on your team. We've gotta do something.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.685
Yeah, well,
you're not doing anything, Andy.

26:38.840 --> 26:42.208
Look, man, your wife is in there!
Now is not the time to not trust me!

26:42.360 --> 26:44.124
Come on, come on, come on.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.246
Son of a bitch.

26:56.800 --> 26:57.767
Hey-

26:57.960 --> 26:59.530
What, you just putting on
a little show for me, huh?

26:59.760 --> 27:01.205
Get your hands off of me, man.
What's wrong with you?

27:01.360 --> 27:03.203
I see you buddying it up with Joyner.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.885
Talking to him thick as thieves.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.566
Would you relax?
We were talking about blackjack.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.967
I was telling him about the card counting
technique you taught me.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.089
- Really, Andy?
- Yeah, really.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.481
Okay, man.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.402
'Cause I can't have you backsliding,
all right?

27:18.600 --> 27:21.410
Man, I agreed to go through
this whole army thing.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.565
And I kept my end of the bargain.
Now I need you to keep yours.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.642
And I need you to start treating me
like a brother and not like a criminal.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.241
Okay.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.721
I'm sorry.

27:35.640 --> 27:36.721
You're right.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.081
John, Shadowspire never made a move
on the shipment,

27:41.280 --> 27:44.921
so whatever their next move is, it...
It's not railguns.

27:45.600 --> 27:50.083
Just call me when you get something
new from your brother. All right.

27:52.680 --> 27:53.681
Oh.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.084
I am so glad
our new lair has elevator access.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.287
Hi.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.444
Curtis has anointed himself
my personal chauffeur.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.086
Fancy. It's a good thing
he didn't ask too many questions

28:04.280 --> 28:07.124
about coming to your campaign office
in the middle of the night.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.049
What are you doing here?

28:09.760 --> 28:12.206
Well, I was at home

28:13.760 --> 28:18.288
feeling more self-pity than I have
in my entire life when it hit me.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.200
This is who I am.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.124
I wanted to come along
on your awesome superhero adventure

28:25.280 --> 28:27.123
because I wanted to help people.

28:28.440 --> 28:32.525
And the old me was so angry at the world.

28:34.280 --> 28:39.127
That anger never accomplished anything,
it just created more anger.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.842
And some seriously bad
personal style choices.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.486
I wanted to do some good in the world.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.210
- Ow.
- That was a good speech.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.323
Thought you'd be a little more impressed.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.847
It was a good speech. But...

28:58.040 --> 29:00.327
But... How did it go again?

29:00.640 --> 29:02.847
I know you, and I do,

29:04.040 --> 29:06.042
you're probably thinking
what happened was your fault.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.209
I'm here to tell you that it's not.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.208
And that it's not mine either.

29:14.440 --> 29:15.771
It's the fault of only one man

29:16.000 --> 29:18.526
and he has an extremely on-the-nose
and alliterative name.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.727
And we're going to stop him.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.881
Not out of guilt or vengeance or regret.

29:27.080 --> 29:30.368
We are going to stop him
because it's what we do.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.730
It's who we are.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.089
- That was a good speech.
- Yeah?

29:40.600 --> 29:42.523
I'm very happy to hear it.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.408
We're gonna need to get some ramps.

29:55.400 --> 30:00.122
A.R.G.U.S. has been compromised.
And Lyla's being held hostage.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.924
Found this in your office.
Hope you don't mind.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.401
Lieutenant, we've picked up
an unauthorized comm

30:10.560 --> 30:12.085
out of the detention area.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.731
Take someone and look into it.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.410
Yes, sir.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.245
Go on.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.605
You might not get the chance
to enjoy it again.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.968
It's been 20 minutes.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.803
I'm gonna have to downsize
your organization yet again?

30:32.080 --> 30:33.161
Apparently.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.448
Well, that's rather cold blooded.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.600
You really don't know her
that well at all, do you?

30:39.520 --> 30:41.921
Ms. Michaels was one
of my most trusted agents.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.840
She knows better than anyone
that I'm perfectly capable

30:45.080 --> 30:48.607
of watching you execute
every person in this room,

30:48.800 --> 30:51.531
and I'll still never give you
the Rubicon access codes.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.964
Is that right, Ms. Michaels?

31:01.440 --> 31:03.602
It's right. It's Why I left.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.966
Amanda Waller doesn't make decisions
based on the value of human life.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.006
Pity.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.327
No!

31:17.440 --> 31:20.887
Well, Ms. Michaels, most trusted agent,

31:22.480 --> 31:24.528
looks like you now have 20 minutes.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.051
John.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.161
My God, no.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.330
Wait, wait a minute. John. John. John.

31:36.480 --> 31:41.168
John, please! He's going to kill her.
You can't afford not to trust me.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.321
- Overwatch, we're onsite.
- Excuse me?

31:55.480 --> 31:58.404
Well, I thought that it was time
you got a codename. What do you think?

31:58.680 --> 31:59.681
It's perfect.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.729
I was gonna go with Oracle,
but it's taken.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.685
Shadowspire's got the entire area
around C-and-C in lockdown.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.444
<i>You guys are the only game in town.</i>

32:06.680 --> 32:08.205
Can you get us inside?

32:11.080 --> 32:12.889
Like that, you mean?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.090
Well, it's about time
you guys came looking.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.281
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

32:22.520 --> 32:25.126
Sergeant Andrew Diggle,
52nd Regiment, 5th Battalion.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.362
- What are you doing locked up here?
- It's a long story.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.369
Shorter version being my brother's a jerk.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.287
Lucky for me, though,
your CO and I go way back.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.520
If you're serious about Lyla Michaels
giving up the Rubicon codes,

32:35.720 --> 32:38.121
you will get on the radio
and tell Lieutenant Joyner

32:38.360 --> 32:42.729
the guy that taught him how to count cards
is here and wants to help him out.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.291
Andy Diggle.
You look pretty good for a dead man.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.050
And here, I thought I'd put on weight.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.606
What are you doing at A.R.G.U.S.,
much less alive?

33:00.800 --> 33:04.486
Amanda Waller brought me in because
of my former association with you guys,

33:06.000 --> 33:07.081
but, small world, though.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.084
Your friend, Ms. Michaels?
She's my sister-in-law.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.241
- Andy...
- Point being,

33:12.400 --> 33:15.563
her husband is crawling around
these ventilation shafts right now.

33:16.400 --> 33:20.166
If you put a gun on him,
she'll tell you whatever you need to know.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.401
You son of a...

33:24.240 --> 33:26.083
Turning on your own brother,
that's ice cold.

33:26.280 --> 33:29.762
Now, you know better than most.
John and I never saw eye to eye.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.086
Gentlemen, check the facility's
ventilation shafts.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.601
Overwatch?

33:39.760 --> 33:41.603
<i>C-and-C three floors down.
Northeast corner.</i>

33:41.760 --> 33:43.524
That'll give us a few minutes.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.485
The other Diggle brother.
Isn't this quaint?

34:11.679 --> 34:14.489
I get out of these cuffs and you'll see
how quaint you think I can be.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.641
It's a shame you can't be
more like the little Diggle.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.851
<i>His pragmatism has proven to be
quite the asset.</i>

34:20.040 --> 34:21.643
Now, if your brother's right,

34:21.800 --> 34:26.886
you should be able to convince your wife
to give me what I want.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.641
Johnnie, if Rubicon ever got out
in the open...

34:29.800 --> 34:32.007
Ms. Michaels, in five seconds,

34:32.159 --> 34:35.164
it's your husband's brains
that will be out in the open.

34:35.320 --> 34:39.484
Four, three, two...

34:40.560 --> 34:43.040
Do it. Do it, Lyla.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.411
It's all right.

34:52.679 --> 34:53.681
Excellent.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.887
If you've run out of guys to punch,
Spartan needs an assist.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.844
<i>Two assists, actually.</i>

35:00.040 --> 35:01.087
Tell us what to do.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.364
Shadowspire's getting the access codes
for a secure vault in the sub-level.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.885
I'm trying to stop the codes from working,

35:06.120 --> 35:09.249
but I'm going to need Canary and Speedy
as my insurance policies.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.041
Where do you want me?

35:19.600 --> 35:21.045
This is taking too long.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.770
Something's wrong.
Someone's locking me out of the system.

35:30.040 --> 35:35.444
Go away. I'm not you anymore.
I haven't been for a long time.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.649
I can't get in. I have all the right codes

35:42.880 --> 35:45.884
but someone on the outside is preventing
me from entering the sub-level vault.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.324
That's extremely unfortunate.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.204
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.282
- You okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.960
Good job.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.485
Yeah, it was like you said,

36:56.640 --> 36:57.801
it was the only way
to get us both in here.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.165
Just remember whose idea this was.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.323
What were you expecting,
a kiss from the President?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.485
To Amanda Waller.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.207
To Amanda Waller.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.407
You remember that time that she tried
to take down the city with a drone strike?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.240
Good times.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.164
Hey, thanks for the assist tonight.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.368
I was just glad to be useful.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.569
Good job jury-rigging
the security system, though.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.603
Just trying to make you proud, Felicity.

37:32.840 --> 37:33.887
You did.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.923
What are you gonna do about Andy?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.604
Still haven't made a decision on that.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.525
You mean even though
he just saved your life?

37:42.720 --> 37:45.690
Yeah, well, you guys had a whole lot
to do with that.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.690
But, you're right,
this is the first time in eight years

37:47.880 --> 37:49.450
I've seen shades of my old brother.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.531
You wanted to see me, sir?

38:07.720 --> 38:08.767
I already got my cut.

38:08.960 --> 38:12.123
Yeah, it's a token of appreciation
from the boss.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.647
He traded the opium for something else.

38:14.880 --> 38:15.881
Like what?

38:16.600 --> 38:18.045
Ask him yourself.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.402
Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Diggle.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.769
Lieutenant Joyner sings your praises.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.088
Happy to help.
What did you get for the opium?

38:26.320 --> 38:29.483
Legend speaks
of a place of immeasurable power.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.882
Many have disappeared searching for it.

38:32.080 --> 38:36.290
So much so that the locals
simply refer to it by one word.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.245
Purgatory.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.088
I thought we were totally unpacked.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.765
Just humor me.

38:48.320 --> 38:49.765
What am I getting?

38:49.960 --> 38:52.964
Uh, yes, that white box. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.761
You ready?

39:01.960 --> 39:03.928
Wow!

39:04.080 --> 39:06.924
When you said that you made
some bad personal style choices,

39:07.120 --> 39:08.167
you weren't kidding.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.204
This is the old me.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.922
A rebellious, brunette hacker who didn't
listen to anyone else's rules but her own.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.645
You're not that person anymore?

39:16.920 --> 39:18.126
Nope.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.603
What you did last night was amazing.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.440
I was really badass.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.761
Yeah.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.122
Though the old me probably would have
stolen the plans for Rubicon

39:27.320 --> 39:29.163
and released them
as some sort of political statement.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.964
The old me
would have snapped Joyner's neck.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.441
Yeah.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.125
We've both grown.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.202
Thank you for always being on my side.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.965
No place I'd rather be.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.525
Hand me that garbage can and this lighter.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.402
How much medication are you on?

39:50.880 --> 39:51.881
Absolutely none.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.321
Okay.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.246
I just wanna make sure
that my past stays the past, you know?

40:04.320 --> 40:05.731
Goodbye.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.163
- One more thing from me.
- What?

40:09.360 --> 40:11.886
The doctor said
your condition is permanent.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.322
And I don't think that it's healthy

40:16.520 --> 40:22.527
or productive for either of us
to live in denial.

40:26.880 --> 40:31.442
But I have seen people speed
and shrink and fly.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.531
We watched a friend of ours
come back from the dead.

40:36.720 --> 40:40.202
That is the world that we live in now.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.122
And I will not stop searching it

40:47.680 --> 40:50.047
until we find a way
to make you walk again.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.126
Hey-

40:57.200 --> 40:58.884
Are you sure about this? 'Cause I'm not.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.724
Better than being in that cage, right?

41:00.880 --> 41:03.042
You might wanna wait outside,
I have it from here.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.564
Make yourself comfortable.
Lyla's cooking something.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.201
Hey-

41:11.200 --> 41:14.727
If this is about reconnecting
with Carly and Andy as well, I, urn...

41:17.040 --> 41:19.247
I get it, Andy. Step by step, right?

41:21.400 --> 41:23.164
AndY-_H€Y-

41:24.400 --> 41:26.562
I'm making pork roast.
Johnnie said it's your favorite.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.085
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.811
We've got another surprise for you, man.
Just a second.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.924
- Hey, Lyla, I...
- Not a word.

41:34.960 --> 41:38.248
John and I both agreed to this.
She's excited to meet you.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.411
This is your niece.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.601
Hey-

41:44.760 --> 41:46.922
Sara. And that's your uncle Andy.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.607
Yeah.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.610
She's got Mom's eyes.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.445
Welcome home, man.

42:27.760 --> 42:28.761
