01:15.141 --> 01:16.609
( croaking )

01:16.643 --> 01:18.845
This semester in biology
we shall study

01:18.878 --> 01:20.714
the ecology of the pond.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.916
Dr. Phelps, where did
these animals come from?

01:22.949 --> 01:26.453
These creatures are visiting
from the pond behind
the football field.

01:26.486 --> 01:29.155
Now to them,
this is a field trip.

01:29.189 --> 01:32.158
Doesn't it bother
them to be moved
from their natural habitat?

01:32.192 --> 01:35.628
Get real, Kelly.
Who would miss sitting
in stagnant water all day?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.597
I would.

01:39.499 --> 01:43.470
Let's get to
know our pond pals
a little better, shall we?

01:43.503 --> 01:45.638
Dr.
Phelps, can I hold the frog?

01:45.672 --> 01:48.441
Don't let him,
he'll give it a wart.

01:48.475 --> 01:51.444
That's a misconception,
frogs do not give warts.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.213
Now, then...

01:53.246 --> 01:58.118
Miss Turtle,
how about holding this turtle?

01:58.118 --> 02:02.889
- I can't, it's slimy.
- I'll hold it, it's cute.

02:02.922 --> 02:06.559
Dr.
Phelps, I'm sorry I'm late,
but I think this duck is hurt.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.596
- What happened, Zack?
- We were playing
baseball last period

02:09.628 --> 02:12.565
and I hit one over the fence.
I found the ball
next to the duck.

02:12.599 --> 02:15.068
- I guess he got
hit by the ball.
- Yeah.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.103
He should have ducked.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.473
And so should you.

02:20.507 --> 02:24.644
Oh, she'll be okay.
She's just a little dazed.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.746
Hit by a ball, typical.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.649
That's what happens when man
encroaches upon
an animal's domain.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.786
Jessie, it was an accident,
not a case for <i>L.A. Law.</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:34.821
This duck will be fine.

02:34.854 --> 02:37.590
We'll observe
her and return her
and the other animals

02:37.624 --> 02:40.727
to the pond where
we can study them
in their natural surroundings.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.563
It's Friday, sir, no one's
gonna be here for the weekend,

02:43.596 --> 02:45.632
- can I take her home?
- All right, Zack.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.600
Sounds like a good idea.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.102
Come on, little lady,

02:49.102 --> 02:51.538
I'm sorry I hit you
over the head with a ball.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.106
You forgive me?

02:53.106 --> 02:54.774
( quacks )

02:54.808 --> 02:58.244
Hi, guys... Whoa, Becky!
Becky, is that you?

02:58.278 --> 02:59.579
( Belding quacking )

02:59.612 --> 03:03.850
Are you sure
you didn't hit him
in the head with a ball first?

03:03.883 --> 03:06.553
No offense, but I think
the stress of
being a principal

03:06.586 --> 03:09.889
- has finally gotten to you.
- No, I'm talking
to my friend Becky.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.760
I know this duck. I feed her
every day at the pond behind
the football field.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.895
- You feed this duck?
- Not only this duck,

03:15.929 --> 03:17.931
but Lyle, Sammy...
Oh, Manny!

03:17.964 --> 03:19.766
And what about
Donald and Daffy?

03:19.799 --> 03:21.101
I think we're
talking to Daffy.

03:21.134 --> 03:24.204
- I think so, too.
- I grew up on a farm.

03:24.237 --> 03:28.541
I used to name all
the animals, okay?
Is Becky all right?

03:28.575 --> 03:30.577
- She got hit by a baseball...
- What?

03:30.610 --> 03:34.080
...but Dr. Phelps says Becky
will be fine in
a couple of days.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.716
You take care of her, Zack.
I have to go to
the football field.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.686
- We're putting
in new goal posts.
- I have to go, too.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.655
I'm the H2O
distribution engineer.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.658
- He means he's a water boy.
- Oh.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.927
Now, Becky,
you listen to what Zack says

03:47.961 --> 03:49.963
and get well soon.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.133
( quacking )

03:53.166 --> 03:56.569
Hi, Becky, what
would you like for lunch?
Don't be shy.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.238
Kelly,
you're talking to a duck.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.506
I've had ducks before.

03:59.539 --> 04:00.874
- I know what they eat.
- What?

04:00.907 --> 04:02.942
A box of "quackers."

04:04.611 --> 04:06.713
Guys, you'll never
guess what happened

04:06.746 --> 04:08.715
when they were putting up
the new goal posts.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.717
They buried Belding
beneath them.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.520
No such luck.
They were drilling
and must have hit a pipeline.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.488
- There's oil squirting out.
- You see, that's what happens

04:16.523 --> 04:19.059
when man alters the natural
order of the environment.

04:19.059 --> 04:23.096
Chill out, Mama,
it was a chick
digging the hole.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.598
It's too bad they didn't
strike oil for real.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.967
Yeah,
we'd be the richest school
in the world.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.905
- We could buy
anything we wanted.
- All: Yeah.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.209
( clock chiming )

04:50.957 --> 04:54.094
Good morning,
rich students of Bayside.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.863
Today is our history midterm.

04:56.896 --> 05:00.700
Mrs. Kerns, I do believe
you are forgetting the rules.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.770
- What rules?
- The rule that we're rich

05:03.803 --> 05:05.638
and there are no rules.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.812
- You rang, sir?
- Yes,
Belding, dismiss this...

05:12.846 --> 05:15.482
Teacher. She tried
to make us learn.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.286
How dare you challenge these
young minds with school work?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.223
If you want to teach,
well then,
go to a cheap school.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.626
Now go on, shoo.
Shoo!

05:27.560 --> 05:30.830
Good work, Belding.
Here's $1,000.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.266
Now go take an old lady
to Magic Mountain.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.602
You're too kind,
Master Slater.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.637
Oo-ooh!

05:37.671 --> 05:41.107
I'm off to the hounds.
Lisa,
would you care to join me?

05:41.141 --> 05:43.910
No, AC, I'm going to shop.

05:43.943 --> 05:45.745
Are you going to the mall?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.614
Perish the thought.

05:47.647 --> 05:50.684
When you're rich,
the mall comes to you.

05:57.957 --> 06:00.927
- I'll take both outfits.
- Yes,
and I'll take both girls.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.162
Sit.

06:02.195 --> 06:06.700
Why should I go to the hounds
when the foxes are right here?

06:06.733 --> 06:08.134
Tallyho.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.039
Are you comfortable,
Miss Jessie?

06:13.039 --> 06:16.309
Quiet, Belding.
I'm tracking down
environmental polluters.

06:16.343 --> 06:21.114
I'm gonna tie their noses
to exhaust pipes
until they go solar.

06:21.147 --> 06:24.084
Then would you
care for some lunch
while you change the world?

06:24.117 --> 06:26.152
Yes.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.928
- Here's your
order from Chez Kelly.
- Chez Kelly?

06:34.961 --> 06:38.298
- What happened to The Max?
- I renamed it
when I bought it.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.267
Oh, well, who cares?
I'm hungry.
Give me my food.

06:41.301 --> 06:44.337
Don't talk to me like that,
I'm the richest
waitress in the world.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.940
I'm as rich as you are.

06:46.973 --> 06:50.910
- Not since Kelly got married.
- Where's my husband?

06:55.215 --> 06:57.150
( Middle Eastern accent )
Come, my darling.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.186
Let's all go to the beach.
The camels are ready.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.821
The beach is polluted.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.257
Not this beach,
my little desert flower.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.260
The big beach,
I just bought Saudi Arabia.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.763
But you can't
just leave school.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.664
Belding, we're rich.

07:11.698 --> 07:14.734
When it comes to school
you have got a lot to learn.

07:16.770 --> 07:21.041
Yeah, school would be
so much better if we owned it.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.177
- Guys, we've struck oil.
- No we didn't,
we just hit a pipe.

07:24.210 --> 07:28.581
No, they checked, there's
no pipeline under the school.
We've struck it rich.

07:33.486 --> 07:36.756
Today is an historic moment
in the history of Bayside.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.627
We have an opportunity to make
Bayside the kind of school
we've all dreamed of.

07:40.660 --> 07:45.231
Great! The Laker Girls
are gonna teach phys ed!

07:45.265 --> 07:49.636
- You are a sexist pig.
- And proud of it.

07:49.669 --> 07:54.374
As you all know,
we have struck oil
on the football field.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.743
The school
board has contracted
with an oil company

07:56.776 --> 07:58.778
to do some
exploratory drilling.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.680
At this time I would like
to introduce

08:00.714 --> 08:04.651
the vice-president
of Cal Star Oil,
Dan Grayson.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.887
- Zack: All right.
- Dan: Thank you.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.524
I'm very honored
the school board
has selected our company

08:11.558 --> 08:15.295
to extract the oil
and jointly build
a better Bayside.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.365
Let's have
hairdressers in homeroom
and manicures in study hall.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.632
Lisa!

08:19.666 --> 08:22.369
There's gonna be a lot
of changes around here.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.637
Mr. Belding can tell us
about some of them.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.907
We are talking new pool,
new gym, new library,

08:27.941 --> 08:30.310
new theater complex,
computers

08:30.343 --> 08:32.779
and the latest visual aids
in every classroom.

08:32.812 --> 08:36.249
In short,
a higher level of education.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.686
Come on,
let's not ruin
this place, sir.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.522
Thanks to this oil discovery
your years at Bayside

08:42.554 --> 08:44.557
will be whatever
you want to make them.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.359
Why do we need more oil?

08:46.393 --> 08:49.729
Why not focus on
alternative sources of energy?
Like the sun.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.399
Because the sun's
our competitor...

08:52.432 --> 08:53.800
We're in the oil business.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.537
( laughs )
That's a good one.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.872
I'm serious.

08:58.905 --> 09:02.442
I know you are
and please excuse my joke.

09:02.475 --> 09:06.346
We are exploring alternatives
like wind and solar power,

09:06.379 --> 09:09.249
but until these technologies
become cost efficient,

09:09.282 --> 09:12.318
- oil is still our
best energy source.
- We're glad it is,

09:12.352 --> 09:16.556
because we want a bigger gym
and a cheerleader
in every locker.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.728
You know,
I've never had a pet before.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.297
It's been fun
having Becky here
the last couple of days.

09:24.330 --> 09:27.801
Probably because
it's the only girl
your mom will let sleep over.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.869
( quacking )

09:29.903 --> 09:33.473
Oh, that's duck for
"I love you, Zack."

09:33.506 --> 09:36.710
- Come on, Becky.
- Hi, you cute little thing.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.212
You're pretty cute
yourself, Mama.

09:39.679 --> 09:40.947
Please...

09:41.047 --> 09:43.783
Zack, I want you to
sign this petition to
stop the oil drilling.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.219
Stop it? You can't be serious.
This oil has been

09:46.252 --> 09:48.755
the best thing
that has happened
since I started school.

09:48.788 --> 09:52.359
Not counting the time we put
the periscope in
the girls' locker room.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.261
- That was you?
- Zack was Skipper
and I was Gilligan.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.466
Jessie,
you look great in a towel,
now drop it.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.601
Zack, I'm asking you
as my friend.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.004
I need your signature
on this petition.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.507
- How many
signatures do you have?
- So far, one.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.311
"Jessie Spano."
Oh, I know her.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.946
That's me, dopus.

10:12.979 --> 10:16.516
I'm sorry, Jessie, I don't
agree with you on this one.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.986
This oil will benefit everyone
in school and the kids
who will come after us.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.555
Will you read the research
I dug up in the library?

10:22.589 --> 10:25.458
You really shouldn't be
digging up in the library.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.994
The oil's under
the football field.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.063
Quiet, little weird man.

10:30.096 --> 10:33.566
Zack, oil can do a lot
of damage to the environment.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.834
Please read it.

10:34.868 --> 10:38.505
- Okay... Okay.
- Okay.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.608
I'll never
forget how you looked
in that towel, babe.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.380
Zack, I think Jessie
has the hots for me.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.916
Oh, yeah,
it's obvious to everyone.

10:49.949 --> 10:52.585
It's getting pretty late.
We should call it a night.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.988
Yeah.
It's bedtime, Becky.

10:55.021 --> 10:59.125
Hey, Zack, can I read her
a story? <i>The Ugly</i>
<i>Duckling</i> or <i>Duck Tales.</i>

10:59.159 --> 11:01.795
She's a duck, she doesn't
understand what you're saying.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.697
- Now get out of here.
- Good night, Becky.

11:03.730 --> 11:08.068
And just remember this...
( mimics Donald Duck )

11:08.068 --> 11:10.403
I heard Donald say that
to Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.739
And you're screwy.
Good night.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.574
( Becky quacks )

11:15.475 --> 11:18.078
I know I shouldn't say this,

11:18.111 --> 11:21.314
but I wish I
didn't have to take you
to the pond tomorrow.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.516
I'm gonna miss you, Becky...
Whoa.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.885
Are you gonna miss me?

11:25.919 --> 11:28.588
Yeah? Don't worry about it.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.957
I'll come visit
you all the time.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.733
Did you read the information
on oil that I left you?

11:39.766 --> 11:43.803
Uh... No, not yet,
but I'll read it tonight,
I promise.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.373
Doesn't anybody feel
the way I feel?

11:46.406 --> 11:50.543
I feel the way you feel
about Kevin Costner,
but not oil.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.712
It's gonna give
us a great school.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.448
- What about you, Kelly?
- I don't know what to think.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.451
I care about the environment,
but I also like Zack's idea

11:58.485 --> 12:00.553
about a hot tub
in every classroom.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.590
- I was kidding.
- Me, too.

12:03.623 --> 12:07.060
Come on,
Kelly, oil causes pollution.
Take a stand.

12:07.093 --> 12:09.329
Hey, leave her alone, Jessie.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.831
Oil also runs cars,
heats homes...

12:11.865 --> 12:14.901
oh, makes plastic earrings
like the ones you're wearing.

12:16.102 --> 12:19.372
Actually, I borrowed these,
right, Lisa?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.640
You're on your own, honey.

12:20.674 --> 12:23.343
That's a fashion
statement I wouldn't make.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.779
- ( bell rings )
- Well, everybody,

12:25.812 --> 12:28.548
today we leave the classroom
and return our animals

12:28.581 --> 12:31.518
to their homes in the wild.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.553
Oh, that's so sad.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.622
I'd like to return
dorks to the wild.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.560
- Where's my turtle?
- Here he is.

12:42.729 --> 12:46.866
I'm gonna miss you,
little fella.
You're slimy but sweet.

12:46.900 --> 12:51.538
And Jessie, Screech,
here are your frogs.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.774
And Slater,
your salamander, sir.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.977
And Kelly,

12:58.011 --> 13:00.747
- here's your crayfish.
- ( giggles )

13:00.780 --> 13:03.516
- Zack, you got Becky?
- Sure do,
don't worry about her.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.085
- Dr. Phelps: All right, good.
- ( drilling )

13:05.118 --> 13:07.587
- Kelly: What is that?
- The oil company,

13:07.620 --> 13:10.056
- disturbing our environment.
- No, it's not.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.058
it's just
a two-ton woodpecker.

13:12.058 --> 13:15.095
Maybe Jessie's right.
I don't like this.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.097
They're just
drilling a test well.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.567
Yeah, you can't make an omelet
without breaking some eggs.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.903
This is just the beginning
of beautiful Bayside,
wait and see.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.439
All right, class,
forget about the noise.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.476
Come on, let's get our animals
back to the pond. Come on.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.978
Okay.
Come on, Becky.

13:32.078 --> 13:35.081
Go ahead.
Come on.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.451
Stop the drilling,
stop the oil!
Stop the drilling, stop the...

13:38.485 --> 13:41.454
- What are you guys doing?
- Protesting for
what we believe.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.723
At least there's one real man
with enough guts

13:43.757 --> 13:46.493
- to stand up for
the environment.
- You mean Franklin?

13:46.526 --> 13:49.129
- Yeah, Franklin.
- Not me, I just wanted to be

13:49.162 --> 13:52.599
chained to
the head cheerleader
and the school president.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.671
It's everything
I dreamed it would be.

13:57.704 --> 14:00.173
- Ugh, don't touch me!
- Ever try nerd love?

14:00.206 --> 14:02.042
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.612
Jess, you're being
an alarmist. You're making
a fool of yourself.

14:05.645 --> 14:09.716
Stop the drilling, stop the
oil! Stop the drilling,
stop the oil!

14:09.749 --> 14:12.485
Stop the shouting,
give me a kiss!

14:12.519 --> 14:14.821
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what is going on here?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.923
Does this have something
to do with the oil?

14:16.956 --> 14:19.559
Oh, you're sharp,
Mr. Belding.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.495
And we're out of here,
we gotta get
ready for gym class.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.963
Stop the drilling,
stop the...

14:24.064 --> 14:25.765
I am giving you
a direct order,

14:25.799 --> 14:28.134
stop this protest immediately.

14:28.168 --> 14:32.105
Not on your life, buster!
I mean if that's okay.

14:32.138 --> 14:35.175
- Come to my office.
- We're not going anywhere.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.911
Well, if you don't,
you're suspended.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.679
We're coming to your office.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.617
I guess we've lost.
Franklin, give me the key.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.986
He swallowed it,
you babes are his.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.522
Unhook me.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.491
This way.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.526
Guys,
there's been an oil spill.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.729
There's oil everywhere.

15:02.335 --> 15:06.072
Hey, come on, Screech,
we gotta get out on the field.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.209
- Be right there.
- Oh, man.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.411
How do you like it?

15:14.080 --> 15:17.117
- Why are you
dressed like Cher?
- It's my new look.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.586
I wanna give the girls'
field hockey team a thrill.

15:19.619 --> 15:23.156
If you really wanna
give them a thrill,
why don't you blindfold them?

15:23.189 --> 15:27.060
Oh, no, Zack. I've caught
them looking at me
and whispering with delight.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.295
Now I'm gonna show them
more than they can handle.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.065
- I don't think
that's a wise...
- If any of them faint

15:32.065 --> 15:36.069
- I'll wake them
with my kisses.
- Yeah, that will kill them.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.939
Hey, Slater,
what happened to you?

15:39.973 --> 15:42.375
- You didn't hear
about the oil spill?
- What oil spill?

15:42.409 --> 15:44.244
They were drilling
on the football field

15:44.277 --> 15:46.513
suddenly oil started
spilling out everywhere.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.315
- Did it get into the pond?
- I don't know.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.218
Becky... The animals...
We just put them
back into the pond.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.320
Come on, we gotta save them.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.494
Dr. Phelps.
Dr. Phelps, we need your help.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.464
- What is it, Zack?
- There's been an oil spill.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.167
It's terrible, sir.
Look what happened to Becky.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.303
- Please, Becky, it's okay.
- Oh, the poor thing!

16:10.337 --> 16:12.605
Please, sir, show us
how to clean her off.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.375
- It's okay, Becky.
- She's not moving, Zack.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.044
She's probably in shock...
Just please help us, sir!

16:18.044 --> 16:21.081
I'll do what I can,
Zack, but...

16:21.114 --> 16:24.484
- Zack, Becky's dead.
- No, no.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.053
Please give her... Come on,
Screech, let's clean her off.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.255
- It's okay,
we'll clean you off.
- It's no use.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.890
I don't believe that.

16:30.924 --> 16:33.493
I wish there was something
I could do, but it's too late.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.062
You guys,
I heard about the pond.

16:39.065 --> 16:42.268
Zack... I'm so sorry.

16:42.302 --> 16:45.472
It's terrible.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.274
I should have
listened to you, Jessie.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.310
I'm sorry, Becky.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.445
It wasn't your fault.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.649
Don't worry about Becky, Zack.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.519
She's where the oil
can't hurt her now.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.356
I feel as bad as you do.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.326
I loved going down to the pond
and feeding Becky.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.161
But accidents happen.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.497
Accidents happen a lot
with oil companies.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.333
Then they just slip out
of being responsible for them.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.536
Jessie, it's not that simple.
With progress there's often

17:16.569 --> 17:19.105
a price to pay. People died
in the space program,

17:19.138 --> 17:21.641
does that mean we should
stop exploring the universe?

17:21.675 --> 17:25.111
Sir, we've gotta do something.
We've gotta stop the drilling.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.346
Stop the drilling?

17:26.378 --> 17:29.049
You wanted a better Bayside
more than anyone.

17:29.049 --> 17:33.053
Sir, I was wrong.
Please,
you have got to do something.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.621
What can I do?

17:34.654 --> 17:37.157
What can you do?
You're the principal,

17:37.190 --> 17:40.060
aren't you man enough
to scare anyone but the kids?

17:41.194 --> 17:43.063
Oops.

17:44.197 --> 17:48.168
Mr. Belding, Becky is dead.
The pond is polluted.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.503
Who knows
what's gonna happen next?

17:51.738 --> 17:54.240
We got there too late.

17:54.274 --> 17:58.645
There's nothing we can do.
All our animals are dead.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.015
We can't let these animals
die for nothing.

18:02.015 --> 18:05.285
Please, you've gotta tell
the school board to
stop the drilling.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.522
I'll try.
But I'm afraid it's gonna take

18:09.556 --> 18:13.326
more than a few dead animals
to change their minds.

18:16.663 --> 18:20.133
As you can see,
the new gymnasium will house

18:20.166 --> 18:23.069
a separate boys'
and girls' basketball court.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.105
Now that may bother
some of you boys

18:25.138 --> 18:27.507
who love sharing a court
with girls in gym shorts.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.576
I'm sorry, guys.

18:29.609 --> 18:33.480
And over here we have a modern
Olympic-sized swimming pool

18:33.513 --> 18:37.250
that will make Shamu jealous.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.220
- Sir,
where's the football field?
- Good question.

18:40.253 --> 18:44.124
That will be constructed
over here where the swampy
area now exists.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.526
You're gonna put
the football
field over the pond?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.294
That pond's
part of our school.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.296
We have to do
most of our drilling

18:50.330 --> 18:52.766
over the old football field,
but as you can
see from the model

18:52.799 --> 18:55.402
we're not just
taking something
out of the ground,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.103
we're putting
a lot more back in.

18:57.137 --> 19:01.207
What's this new campus
going to cost in taxes?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.276
I'm glad you asked that.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.079
Cal Star and the school board
will be partners

19:06.112 --> 19:10.283
in building
a beautiful new Bayside.
It will cost you nothing.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.023
- That's not true.
- What do you mean, young man?

19:17.057 --> 19:20.293
Mr.
Belding, may I have the floor
to make a presentation?

19:20.326 --> 19:22.662
You've got it, Zack.

19:22.696 --> 19:27.033
Ladies and gentlemen,
I may only be
a high school kid,

19:27.067 --> 19:30.070
but I've already learned that
you never get
something for nothing.

19:30.103 --> 19:32.372
Everything has its price.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.108
Mr. Grayson, this is
a very beautiful model,

19:35.141 --> 19:39.079
but where are the oak trees
behind the library where
we used to have lunch?

19:39.112 --> 19:42.549
You can have lunch in your
brand-new
state-of-the-art cafeteria.

19:42.582 --> 19:46.486
- And where are the trees?
- I'm afraid we'll
have to replace them.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.055
No, you mean, cut them down
and put up an oil derrick.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.057
But that's not here
on the model, sir.

19:51.091 --> 19:55.462
- Yes, of course
there will be derricks.
- Sort of like this?

19:57.263 --> 19:59.766
Now, when we're having classes
in this building right here,

19:59.799 --> 20:01.201
and look out the window,

20:01.234 --> 20:03.703
what are we gonna see?
One of these?

20:03.737 --> 20:07.774
I guess they were
left off by mistake. Now...

20:07.807 --> 20:11.211
where are the benches
and trees where we had
classes when it got hot?

20:11.244 --> 20:15.148
You won't have to sit outside,
the whole school
will be air-conditioned.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.184
Who needs benches and trees?
We'll just put up
another oil rig.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.353
What are you trying to say,
young man?

20:20.387 --> 20:24.824
What I'm trying to say is,
that Cal Star Oil is right,

20:24.858 --> 20:27.127
we're not taking something
out of the ground,

20:27.160 --> 20:30.163
we're helping put
a lot more back in.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.431
Jessie.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.700
Yesterday,
because of your oil spill

20:33.733 --> 20:38.238
we put 20 dead animals
back into the ground.

20:38.271 --> 20:42.142
We're sorry about that.
It was an accident
and we cleaned it up.

20:42.175 --> 20:45.111
Yeah, but can you guarantee
it won't happen again?

20:45.145 --> 20:47.147
There are no guarantees
but we'll...

20:47.180 --> 20:49.549
Yes, but what happens
if there's a bigger accident

20:49.582 --> 20:53.186
and oil gets over everything
just like this?

20:54.521 --> 20:57.724
Young man, this is outrageous.
You give me that.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.726
Look at this!

20:59.759 --> 21:01.428
I'm covered with oil.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.396
It was an accident, sir.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.332
But at least you'll be alive
when you clean it off.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.101
See, sir,

21:08.134 --> 21:10.704
I wanted a bigger
and better Bayside
more than anybody.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.540
Even more than you,
Mr. Grayson.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.443
But us kids don't want
to pay that price.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.845
We don't want to go
to school in an oil field.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.886
I think we know
how we should vote.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.489
Mr. Grayson,
thank you for coming.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.225
We already have
a better Bayside,

21:32.258 --> 21:34.527
we just didn't know it
until now.

21:46.206 --> 21:48.708
( instrumental music plays )
