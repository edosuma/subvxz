00:28.362 --> 00:29.988
Mom, Mom! That lady--

00:30.072 --> 00:31.990
She's fine. See? She's okay.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.744
- She's going to the other side.
- No, no. God!

00:35.827 --> 00:37.579
Don't! Oh--

00:37.663 --> 00:39.623
- Don't look!
- She let go.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.347
Blink twice if you can hear me.

00:57.975 --> 01:01.019
-How long have I been out?
-Three days.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.813
Did I flatline?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.273
No, sweetheart.
You're gonna be all right.

01:05.357 --> 01:08.068
Are you sure?
Did you read the ambulance record?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.989
I did not, but it's in your chart.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.491
You have severe hypothermia
and you're in shock.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.785
If you didn't hit feet first,

01:16.869 --> 01:20.288
you would have smashed up your insides
like hitting concrete.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.790
You got lucky.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.834
What's your name?

01:25.836 --> 01:30.298
Do you have family in the area?
We need to contact them ASAP.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.386
Do you want these--

01:34.469 --> 01:36.346
No, no, no, don't touch. No touching.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.474
Okay. No touching.

01:42.352 --> 01:46.774
Can you tell me...
how you got those scars?

01:51.320 --> 01:54.114
At least tell me your name.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.910
Who are you?

01:57.993 --> 02:01.955
I'm Alice, honey.
I'm a nurse at St. Louis Hospital.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.208
What's your name?

02:08.921 --> 02:10.297
I'm the OA.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.969
Really? That's funny.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.514
Uh, Ron...

02:19.597 --> 02:23.393
My cell is ringing.
Just... hold on a second.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.603
Eat before it gets cold.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.481
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

02:27.564 --> 02:30.651
Oh, uh, Erica,
I'm just talking to my brother.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.070
-Can I--
<i>-Nancy, you gotta get on YouTube.</i>

02:33.153 --> 02:36.156
<i>-Okay? Can you do that?</i>
-Yeah, of course I know YouTube.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.533
What...

02:38.617 --> 02:40.952
Well, what makes you think that?

02:42.287 --> 02:43.622
Uh...

02:43.705 --> 02:46.291
<i>Okay, I sent you an email with a link.</i>

02:48.877 --> 02:50.962
<i>- Nance?</i>

02:51.046 --> 02:54.216
<i>You got it?</i>

02:58.095 --> 02:59.387
Abel!

02:59.471 --> 03:01.306
- <i>Mom, Mom!</i>
<i>- She's fine.</i>

03:01.389 --> 03:03.433
- Abel!
<i>- She's okay.</i>

03:04.643 --> 03:08.188
- <i>She's going to the other side.</i>
<i>- Oh--</i> <i>Don't look!</i>

03:08.271 --> 03:10.648
-As her legal guardian--
-Yeah, I understand. I understand.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.317
I talked to the hospital lawyers.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.402
She simply isn't responding
to the name you gave.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.905
Well, we know what she looks like.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.950
I should warn you,
she's in a very fractured mental state.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.159
Agitated.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.912
Kept trying to get to
the computers in the ICU.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.750
If she is, in fact, who you think she is,

03:27.833 --> 03:32.170
you should know...
she has very unusual scarring on her back.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.798
The nurse said it's difficult to look at.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.512
She won't talk to anyone,
including the police, about what happened.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.473
It's our professional opinion
that she be committed to in-patient care.

03:43.556 --> 03:47.477
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Can we just see our daughter, please?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.824
Who are these people?

04:35.901 --> 04:38.403
Mom?

04:40.697 --> 04:41.782
Prairie?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.410
Prairie?

04:50.457 --> 04:51.875
Prairie?

04:58.048 --> 04:59.466
I don't understand.

05:00.383 --> 05:05.013
She's our daughter, Prairie,
but she's never seen us before.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.184
Seven years ago,
when she went missing...

05:10.268 --> 05:11.769
she was blind.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.586
- Is this it?
- It is.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.588
You're home.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.843
All these cars...

05:44.594 --> 05:47.222
I guess someone's having a party.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.100
Oh, dear God.

05:51.643 --> 05:52.644
How did they...

05:54.020 --> 05:56.898
Well, let's get inside.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.985
I should reverse.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.654
You can't...
You can't reverse now.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.948
Don't worry, sweetheart,
they're-they're just happy...

06:05.032 --> 06:07.159
- Back up, please. Back off.
- ...that you're home safe.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.868
Thank you.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.370
Back out of the way.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.623
You might remember
when Prairie Johnson disappeared

06:13.706 --> 06:15.167
-seven years ago...
-Give us some room, please.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.586
...she was blind.
Now reportedly she can see.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.546
They're already calling her
the Michigan Miracle.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.715
Oh, here she is. Prairie! Prairie!

06:21.798 --> 06:25.385
We're so... we're so happy you're home.
Let us see your face.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.346
Prairie, Prairie, is it...
is it true you can see?

06:28.430 --> 06:30.140
Prairie, how did this happen?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.599
Welcome home, Prairie!

06:31.683 --> 06:33.476
That is not your name.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.146
- Prairie is not your name.
- Back off. Thank you.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.439
Over here, take a right.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.065
We're so happy you're home safe.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.277
- Step coming up. Step.
- Let us see your eyes, Prairie.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.905
-Prairie, who took you?
-Nancy?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.707
Abel, do you think it was a miracle?

06:56.499 --> 07:00.003
Yes, it's true,
our daughter can now see.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.383
We found out yesterday.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.061
Thank you!

07:27.572 --> 07:29.532
<i>I was on the task force</i>
<i>that led the investigation</i>

07:29.616 --> 07:31.409
when you went missing.

07:31.493 --> 07:35.455
I... am very, very glad to meet you.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.291
Thank you.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.131
So, we're just gonna
ask you some questions

07:44.214 --> 07:46.258
and you do the best you can, okay?

07:48.343 --> 07:52.264
So, do you remember any of the events
that led up to your disappearance?

07:52.930 --> 07:54.474
I remember everything.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.227
Specifically, do you remember
the night that you disappeared?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.771
I didn't disappear.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.649
I was present for all of it.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.402
All seven years, three months, 11 days.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.909
Sorry--

08:12.992 --> 08:14.827
No, no, no, you're okay.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.622
Maybe it would be better
if we try to work this backwards.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.042
Let's start with the bridge.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.002
Do you remember how you got there?

08:23.086 --> 08:26.881
I walked, um, for a long time.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.049
Maybe...

08:28.966 --> 08:30.927
maybe days from...

08:32.929 --> 08:35.056
I don't know where. Nowhere.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.725
Until I got to a road

08:37.809 --> 08:40.020
and I tried to get a ride.

08:40.103 --> 08:45.067
And finally an old woman
in a dusty car picked me up.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.527
What was her name? Where was this?

08:48.695 --> 08:51.156
She-- She brought me to a place.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.076
There were a lot of people there.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.369
All-- All of them were lost.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.746
A shelter?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.626
Uh, I don't know.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.046
Did you tell them who you were,
or where you'd been,

09:07.130 --> 09:09.299
or that you wanted to go home?

09:09.966 --> 09:13.178
I told them that I needed to leave,
so they let me go.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.389
And I just kept walking.

09:18.225 --> 09:22.229
Trying to... get back.

09:23.104 --> 09:23.938
Home?

09:27.775 --> 09:29.611
To where you'd been held captive?

09:36.951 --> 09:38.745
But I knew that they were gone.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.498
The other captives?

09:42.123 --> 09:45.043
When-- When you say gone,
do you mean dead?

09:45.127 --> 09:46.461
Um...

09:46.544 --> 09:49.046
Is that why you attempted
to end your life at the bridge?

09:49.131 --> 09:51.466
- That's not what I was doing.
- But you jumped.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.843
I was trying to get back to them to--

09:53.927 --> 09:56.096
I was trying to get help in order--

09:56.179 --> 09:59.641
You could've called the police
from the shelter. They could've helped.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.768
That wouldn't--
That wouldn't have helped.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.395
Okay, we're just trying to follow.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.022
So, they're not dead?

10:06.648 --> 10:09.484
We all died more times than I can count.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.824
I think that's enough for now.

10:23.581 --> 10:27.084
Your daughter's still immersed
in her experience, which is normal.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.671
It's just best if we try again
in a week or so.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.756
If she were the perpetrator,
we could push it.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.509
But you can't make a victim talk.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.121
Homer.

13:20.842 --> 13:21.884
I bet...

13:22.510 --> 13:25.054
I bet no one's around outside now.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.308
-Hmm?
-Mmm-hmm.

13:31.019 --> 13:34.981
I know that these things take time,

13:35.064 --> 13:36.899
and there's no rush...

13:36.983 --> 13:39.527
but I really need to know something.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.531
How can you see?

13:43.615 --> 13:46.242
Can you tell me?

13:49.495 --> 13:50.496
No.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.833
I can't.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.595
Do you remember
when they were building these?

14:05.678 --> 14:09.140
It was gonna be the new Crestwood.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.767
Crestwood View.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.311
Then they ran out of money to finish.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.188
Always gives me a weird feeling.

14:19.984 --> 14:24.196
How'd all this stuff get way back here?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.170
Wait, wait. Watch this.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.802
Sick.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.763
Whoa!

14:49.431 --> 14:50.598
Yo, it's her.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.271
Shit, dude.
I think that's Prairie Johnson.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.478
-I don't think I can cum again.
-Oh.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.106
I think I bit my lip.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.983
You get blood on my dick?

15:42.066 --> 15:43.526
No, asshole.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.280
You like that video Jesse made?

15:49.574 --> 15:51.159
Yeah, the stunts are cool.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.160
You got skills.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.922
Whoa! How did you guys
film the blind girl?

16:05.006 --> 16:07.884
-She's not blind anymore.
-That's insane.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.637
- Remember when she went missing?
- Yeah.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.723
We weren't allowed to go outside
for, like, three years.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.102
Hey, don't go yet. It's early.
Let's watch some stuff in bed.

16:19.103 --> 16:23.900
Steve, you have a really nice body

16:23.983 --> 16:26.318
and you smell good,

16:26.402 --> 16:27.904
but this isn't a thing.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.698
It's chill.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.701
There's someone else
I'm into anyway, too.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.079
Who are you into?

16:37.163 --> 16:40.041
This guy in chorus.
You wouldn't know him.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.083
Chorus?

16:41.751 --> 16:44.170
Aren't they all, like, gay?

16:44.253 --> 16:47.674
Steve, I don't have to tell you shit
and you don't have to tell me shit, okay?

16:47.757 --> 16:50.176
Let's just let fucking be fucking.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.546
Why is there a hole in my wall?

17:27.797 --> 17:30.299
-Steve?
-Yeah.

17:31.175 --> 17:35.054
That teacher, what was her name,
Broderick-Allen?

17:35.805 --> 17:36.973
She emailed.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.475
She used the word "bully."

17:39.559 --> 17:42.270
Sounds like you haven't been
keeping your promises to me.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.022
Fix it.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.116
Do you remember the night
we pretended we were in real beds

17:55.199 --> 17:58.202
and we described them to each other?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.999
I'm in a real bed...

18:04.834 --> 18:07.712
but I haven't slept a single night
apart from you.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.342
I'm scared, Homer.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.724
There are moments
when I think I made you up.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.270
That's why I need to see you.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.774
To be sure you're real.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.949
I didn't leave you behind.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.493
I would never.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.664
I am coming for you.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.418
Good morning, sweetheart.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.919
Good morning.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.882
You said you'd get me
the password for the Wi-Fi.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.259
About that...

18:56.468 --> 18:57.720
Uh...

18:59.180 --> 19:01.933
"Phone and Internet use
should be monitored."

19:04.060 --> 19:08.272
It's-- It's for your own safety.
It's from the hospital in St. Louis.

19:10.358 --> 19:14.653
Um, they go on with,
"Doors should remain open at all times."

19:15.362 --> 19:17.073
I think that's excessive.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.242
Why don't we just go with
not locking doors?

19:21.869 --> 19:23.204
All right, honey?

19:32.588 --> 19:36.258
<i>Of those, more than</i>
<i>200,000 are abducted by family members.</i>

19:36.342 --> 19:39.261
<i>Only an estimated 115 are the victims</i>

19:39.345 --> 19:42.139
<i>of kidnapping cases</i>
<i>like Elizabeth Smart's.</i>

19:42.223 --> 19:45.017
<i>Can this girl go back to being</i>
<i>a normal human being,</i>

19:45.101 --> 19:47.478
<i>or is there always a part</i>
<i>of your experiences...</i>

20:29.686 --> 20:31.397
Hey. Hey...

20:32.106 --> 20:33.190
Do you have Wi-Fi?

20:34.942 --> 20:38.279
Uh... there's, uh,
there's no electricity here.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.657
But you live in the neighborhood.
Could I get your password?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.910
Our Internet's down. It's important.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.289
I don't know.
Maybe ask upstairs.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.259
I can't skip hormones week to week.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.928
- I'm counting on you, Steve.
- This is business.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.095
All right, don't waste my time.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.347
There's a ton of people
who'll buy this shit if you don't.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.598
You want it or not?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.268
Give me the Demerol, instead.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.523
What the fuck? Who said you could
come into this house and film me?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.733
-It's not on. I'm not recording.
-No, like fuck it's not.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.739
You're Prairie Johnson, aren't you?

21:23.908 --> 21:24.909
I'm the OA.

21:25.576 --> 21:26.994
What kind of a name is that?

21:27.078 --> 21:30.164
I need Internet.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.498
Will you give me your password,

21:31.582 --> 21:33.584
or the password for one of the houses
next door to me?

21:33.667 --> 21:35.336
What's this look like to you,
a Starbucks?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.004
Not my problem. Get out.

21:41.592 --> 21:45.262
-Give me a password and I'll go.
-No, I don't owe you shit, bitch.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.973
Now leave or you're dog food.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.563
-Give me my camera.
-This is my camera now.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.274
Tax for your interruption.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.736
Yo, I don't need news vans and cops
all over this neighborhood.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.199
I'm warning you.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.250
Attack!

22:20.506 --> 22:21.799
Aah!

22:21.883 --> 22:23.550
Stop, stop!

22:27.304 --> 22:28.931
Don't you dare, Buck!

22:32.393 --> 22:34.061
Oh, my God.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.565
What the fuck?

22:39.691 --> 22:41.735
Don't bite my dog!

22:43.529 --> 22:45.948
You're good.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.286
You're okay.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.075
Wait.

23:30.952 --> 23:32.744
How did you get your sight?

23:43.380 --> 23:46.883
Come on, boy.
Yo, Axel, come on.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.595
Come on.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.534
Crazy fuck.

24:17.331 --> 24:20.167
You can't just disappear like that,
Prairie. You scared us.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.377
Please don't call me that.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.006
What am I supposed to do?

24:26.757 --> 24:28.217
Help me a little.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.513
You-- You won't talk to the FBI...

24:33.931 --> 24:37.226
but you...
you won't talk to me either. I...

24:39.311 --> 24:41.772
I read about trauma online.
I know that--

24:41.855 --> 24:44.358
It would help if you would
let me go online.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.528
To find Homer?

24:49.363 --> 24:50.531
You watched my video?

24:52.574 --> 24:54.493
Well, to try to help you.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.207
-Are you hearing voices again?
-I'm not hearing anything!

25:04.545 --> 25:07.714
When you were a little girl
first learning how to cane...

25:09.591 --> 25:12.553
you got too confident too fast.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.388
You decided to run.

25:15.389 --> 25:18.684
You smacked into the edge of a wall
and split your forehead open.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.227
Do you remember that?

25:22.688 --> 25:26.192
I... I know that you're not
my flesh and blood...

25:28.444 --> 25:30.321
but when that happened...

25:31.863 --> 25:33.657
I knew that you were my daughter.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.785
Because I felt it.

25:36.868 --> 25:40.747
I felt like I got hit by that wall, too.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.753
It's what I feel like now.

25:48.046 --> 25:51.049
This is strange... for both of us.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.847
You've got these--

25:59.892 --> 26:04.605
But you're... you're not a stranger.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.276
Mom, please.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.903
It's not that I don't want to tell you.
I want to...

26:13.239 --> 26:15.449
It's that it would hurt me to hurt you.

26:17.159 --> 26:19.245
And it would hurt you.

26:22.873 --> 26:24.791
Just give me some time.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.676
Watch it.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.804
Come on. Hey. He's not worth it.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.978
Yo, dude! Stop!

27:29.690 --> 27:31.692
Man, I heard you singing in there.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.527
Like... whoa!

27:34.486 --> 27:36.655
Hey, you and your mom
just moved into Crestwood, right?

27:36.738 --> 27:37.781
What's your name?

27:38.782 --> 27:39.991
Miles.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.371
-I gotta run.
-Man, what are you gonna do with that?

27:44.455 --> 27:46.707
You could be, like, famous.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.669
I don't really want to talk to you.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.046
What?

27:53.880 --> 27:56.967
You made fun of one of my friends
for being gay,

27:57.050 --> 28:00.346
and now you hear me sing
and it's, like, all good?

28:01.597 --> 28:03.724
-It's not like <i>American Idol,</i> like...
-Uh-huh.

28:03.807 --> 28:07.102
-Not in a mean way, but...
-I get it. Relax, man.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.146
Hey, Miles?

28:52.398 --> 28:54.233
<i>I feel something forming.</i>

28:55.233 --> 28:56.818
<i>Not a plan, but...</i>

28:57.861 --> 28:59.571
<i>a feeling.</i>

29:00.531 --> 29:03.700
I met this boy and I think he has
something to do with it.

29:07.245 --> 29:10.123
I keep trying to imagine you at his age.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.002
Sixteen, seventeen.

29:22.386 --> 29:23.387
Please.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.522
What you up to, crazy?

29:34.189 --> 29:35.566
Looks weird in here.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.070
I got a mobile router.

29:41.363 --> 29:45.200
Just hook it up to your laptop,
bam, it's connected, and paid for.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.620
- Oh, my God.
- You want me to set it up?

29:48.704 --> 29:51.457
Yeah.

29:51.540 --> 29:54.418
So, uh, I was thinking...

29:54.501 --> 29:57.045
have you ever seen
<i>Strangers on a Train?</i>

29:57.129 --> 29:57.963
No.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.883
Basically, it's like,
if people don't know you're connected...

30:02.509 --> 30:05.053
then they can't figure out
the crimes you do for each other.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.349
Thought I'd help you out
and you could help me out.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.434
I do need help.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.060
Good.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.731
-You gonna plug that in?
-Oh.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.234
You're crazy.

30:20.193 --> 30:21.570
All right.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.156
Where's your mouse?

30:25.240 --> 30:27.409
You use this.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.578
-And then, right here...
-All right, yeah.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.829
-Enter.
-I got it. I got it.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.707
<i>Launch Safari. Search YouTube.</i>

30:34.249 --> 30:37.336
<i>- A-S-H-E-V.</i>

30:39.129 --> 30:41.172
So, that's the trouble
we need to get me out of.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.424
<i>Move, move, move.</i>

30:42.508 --> 30:46.970
My dad wants to send me to Asheville
to get, like... straightened out.

30:47.053 --> 30:49.347
No one really goes there voluntarily,
if you know what I mean.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.058
- <i>Gentle.</i>
<i>- Mom!</i>

30:51.141 --> 30:55.187
- <i>Don't hurt him. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>- Mom! Mama!</i>

30:55.270 --> 30:57.063
<i>Keep it going, man.</i>
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

30:57.147 --> 30:58.524
<i>Don't hurt him, please.</i>

30:58.607 --> 31:01.402
- <i>Mom!</i>
- I'll help you.

31:02.444 --> 31:03.904
But I have conditions.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.782
I need five people.

31:06.865 --> 31:10.911
And I need them to be strong like you are,
and flexible and brave.

31:10.994 --> 31:14.373
And I need to use the abandoned house
as a meeting place.

31:14.456 --> 31:17.042
-Sure. Whatever you want.
-And no touching.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.378
I don't like to be touched.

31:20.170 --> 31:23.465
No touching. No big deal.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.469
You'll really do all that?

31:28.136 --> 31:31.056
Well, <i>Strangers on a Train.</i>
That's the idea.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.016
But you gotta keep your end first.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.644
Okay.

32:00.418 --> 32:03.296
-So, what happened?
-Nothing. Doesn't matter.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.550
She said she likes some guy in chorus.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.260
Come on.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.598
Well, it's okay.
You don't want to go there

32:12.681 --> 32:15.183
until your invisible self
is more developed anyway.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.477
What?

32:17.393 --> 32:21.607
You know, your... longings,
the desires you don't tell anyone about.

32:22.566 --> 32:25.527
I was just starting to think
you were okay, but you blew it.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.823
You spend a lot of time
on the visible you. It's impressive.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.158
But she probably thinks
the invisible you is missing.

32:32.242 --> 32:35.078
I have desires. I work hard.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.998
I'm not gonna learn Chinese tomorrow
and be, like, a CEO or some shit.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.708
But I want stuff.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.168
Like what?

32:42.252 --> 32:45.005
You know, to be somebody.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.465
I have ambitions.

32:47.508 --> 32:49.342
I'm gonna be a trainer to celebrities.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.386
I'll have my own show,
my own line of equipment.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.805
Me and Jesse have
a YouTube channel already.

32:54.765 --> 32:57.308
That's stuff on the outside, though.
What about the stuff on the inside?

32:57.392 --> 32:59.477
Who the fuck asked you, crazy?

32:59.561 --> 33:01.104
You're a grown-up who still lives
at your parents'

33:01.187 --> 33:02.564
and tried to kill yourself.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.152
<i>Attention, shoppers.</i>
<i>Take advantage of our home sale.</i>

33:07.235 --> 33:09.445
<i>You can save 40-50% off...</i>

33:09.530 --> 33:12.407
<i>Let's just say this girl</i>
<i>was worried about my invisible side...</i>

33:12.491 --> 33:15.327
Which she's not,
'cause she just likes to fuck.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.370
But say she was...

33:17.996 --> 33:20.456
How do I, like, show her I got it?

33:22.208 --> 33:24.836
Ugh! Yo, be gentle with that shit, OA.

33:32.553 --> 33:34.304
Maybe try closing your eyes.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.432
Just more often or...

33:39.517 --> 33:42.938
Being blind was powerful.
It made me listen.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.150
And it made people
underestimate me.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.036
Boring.

33:58.119 --> 34:02.123
Yeah. It's boring... at first.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.775
You gotta do a grown-up hairdo.

34:54.968 --> 34:56.970
Oh, hey, don't I know you?

34:58.888 --> 35:00.140
Yeah.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.350
I'm a parent.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.001
I'm sorry. I have a meeting.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.961
Uh, I think I am your meeting.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.673
I'm expecting Mr. Winchell.
We've been speaking.

35:32.756 --> 35:35.466
I'm, uh, Steve's stepmother.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.053
Oh, of course.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.471
Have a seat.

35:45.727 --> 35:50.148
<i>Well, I'm not calling this meeting</i>
<i>to blame you or your husband.</i>

35:50.231 --> 35:52.901
I'm calling this meeting
to let you know that your son,

35:52.984 --> 35:54.778
your husband's son,

35:54.861 --> 35:57.823
has become such a problem
that I'm asking the school board

35:57.906 --> 35:59.365
for his immediate expulsion.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.285
Oh, um...

36:03.244 --> 36:05.538
Could you explain the problem?

36:06.456 --> 36:09.835
I think it should be obvious
from my probation letter, but if I must...

36:11.127 --> 36:13.004
I'm here to teach
the kids that want to learn,

36:13.088 --> 36:16.091
the kids that have a desire
to better themselves.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.886
And if a disruptive, violent,
and frankly, terrible student

36:19.970 --> 36:23.139
causes me problems, that's fine.
I can handle that.

36:23.849 --> 36:27.811
But when he costs the hardworking students
their right to an education,

36:27.894 --> 36:29.604
that's when I say no more.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.025
I think he has real psychological issues.

36:34.985 --> 36:37.738
Well, it's not really a measure
of mental health to be well-adjusted

36:37.821 --> 36:41.074
in a society that's very sick.

36:41.157 --> 36:44.285
That's a very clever
bumper sticker, Mrs. Winchell,

36:44.369 --> 36:47.580
but I'm going to remove your son
from this school.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.960
Right.

36:56.006 --> 36:57.799
What was your first reason?

36:58.466 --> 36:59.509
I'm sorry?

37:00.135 --> 37:01.553
Why did you become a teacher?

37:02.303 --> 37:04.055
-This isn't about me.
-But it is.

37:04.139 --> 37:08.101
It's about you and Steve,
and the play, cast of two,

37:08.184 --> 37:11.104
setting, classroom,
over many dimensions through time.

37:12.522 --> 37:13.356
I don't follow.

37:14.983 --> 37:18.236
Maybe Steve can't learn
because you lost track of your reason.

37:18.319 --> 37:20.071
-Oh, God, this is ridiculous.
-Betty...

37:25.118 --> 37:26.744
Maybe I can help you remember.

37:31.291 --> 37:34.335
You lost someone.
Someone important to you.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.177
I lost someone important to me, too.

37:44.971 --> 37:48.224
-Who'd you lose?
-My patience if you don't stop.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.895
Was it your first love? Or a parent?

37:52.770 --> 37:54.730
Someone you loved young?

37:55.857 --> 37:57.192
A sibling?

38:01.029 --> 38:03.781
Look, you want to talk turkey?

38:04.699 --> 38:08.036
Your sociopath of a son
punched a kid in the throat.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.664
The victim didn't report it
because he feared reprisal.

38:12.373 --> 38:17.212
That boy has a lacerated trachea
and is unable to sing at Nationals.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.924
So, I don't give a crap
where the violence comes from and why.

38:21.591 --> 38:23.134
I don't want it in my school.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.261
No, you're right. Sorry, you're right.

38:26.179 --> 38:30.892
You're right. This dimension
is crumbling to violence and pettiness

38:30.976 --> 38:35.480
and greed, and Steve is sensitive enough
to feel it and he's angry.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.315
He's angry and he's lost.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.692
And in order to find him,
you'd have to teach yourself again,

38:39.775 --> 38:43.654
and you decided somewhere along the way
that you were done learning.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.033
It's... it's too painful to stay open.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.953
Well, I think we all face the same
hopelessness, Mrs. Winchell.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.622
It's what we decide to do with it.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.750
You're right. So what are you gonna do?

38:57.168 --> 39:00.213
If you want to do your job,
expel the bully.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.674
Focus on the kid who sings like an angel
even though he doesn't need you.

39:04.968 --> 39:07.929
If you want to be a teacher, teach Steve.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.307
He's the boy you can help become a man.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.686
He's the one you lost.

39:15.395 --> 39:16.980
He's your first reason.

39:35.248 --> 39:38.043
I didn't catch your first name,
Mrs. Winchell.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.464
I'm the OA.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.459
Okay, a show of hands...

40:40.771 --> 40:44.609
<i>A story of a shocking miracle</i>
<i>emerged from Jefferson City today.</i>

40:44.692 --> 40:47.612
<i>Last fall,</i>
<i>Pershing College's star quarterback</i>

40:47.695 --> 40:50.949
<i>was expected to bring Missouri</i>
<i>the championship title</i>

40:51.032 --> 40:55.911
<i>until a near fatal accident on the field</i>
<i>left him paralyzed and locked in a coma.</i>

40:55.996 --> 40:57.455
<i>He ain't movin'.</i>

40:57.538 --> 41:00.500
<i>And as they held hands</i>
<i>around their son's dying body,</i>

41:00.583 --> 41:03.336
<i>a miracle happened. He woke up.</i>

41:03.419 --> 41:06.006
<i>You had what they call</i>
<i>a near-death experience?</i>

41:06.089 --> 41:10.801
<i>Yeah, I flatlined, uh,</i>
<i>after the accident, at the hospital.</i>

41:10.885 --> 41:13.012
<i>So, you know what it's like to die?</i>

41:14.514 --> 41:15.765
<i>Um...</i>

41:16.807 --> 41:19.519
<i>Yes, I... I guess I do. Um...</i>

41:20.936 --> 41:22.522
<i>But I'm back now.</i>

41:24.274 --> 41:27.193
<i>And I'm not...</i>
<i>I'm not leaving the championship game</i>

41:27.276 --> 41:28.986
<i>on a stretcher this year.</i>

41:29.779 --> 41:32.031
- <i>Atta boy.</i>
<i>- I'm leaving with that ring.</i>

41:35.826 --> 41:37.495
Homer...

41:41.916 --> 41:44.502
Homer, where are you?

42:04.021 --> 42:07.733
Prairie,
there's an important phone call for you.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.904
I can't talk right now.

42:12.488 --> 42:15.074
I think you should. It's the FBI.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.755
Hello?

42:28.838 --> 42:31.340
<i>That was like</i>
<i>the Spanish Inquisition.</i>

42:33.176 --> 42:36.471
Um, would you mind if I talked on my own?

42:37.138 --> 42:39.348
-Of course.
-Thank you.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.642
Thanks.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.230
<i>It was like</i>
Invaders of the Body Snatchers.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.232
Broderick-Allen is a different person.

42:48.233 --> 42:52.278
Listen, I need five people,
and I need them tonight.

42:52.362 --> 42:54.530
We have to get started
because it's gonna take some time.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.324
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Chill.
What are you talking about?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.326
<i>Strangers on the Train. </i>You owe me.

42:58.409 --> 43:00.870
They need to be strong
and they need to be flexible like you are.

43:00.953 --> 43:04.249
-Why? What for?
<i>-I didn't ask you questions, did I?</i>

43:04.332 --> 43:06.126
No, you were cool.

43:06.209 --> 43:08.085
Midnight, at the abandoned house.

43:08.169 --> 43:11.088
And everybody needs to leave
their front door open. That's important.

43:11.172 --> 43:14.384
I always forget how crazy you are.
Nobody is doing that.

43:14.467 --> 43:17.220
-That's how you get your shit stolen.
<i>-Steve...</i>

43:18.596 --> 43:21.432
Look, I've got something
going tonight, all right?

43:21.516 --> 43:24.852
And with the router, I...
I think we're pretty even.

43:24.935 --> 43:28.439
<i>Steve, you punched a kid in the throat.</i>

43:28.523 --> 43:30.108
<i>You didn't tell me that.</i>

43:32.485 --> 43:36.322
Look, I'm at the end of a rope
I should've fallen off of a long time ago.

43:36.406 --> 43:38.533
And I need to help someone.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.869
It's a long shot, but you're strong,
that's why I chose you.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.913
I chose you, crazy.

43:43.996 --> 43:45.498
<i>You sure about that?</i>

43:49.877 --> 43:53.256
Midnight. Five people.
You gave me your word.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.383
All right.

43:56.259 --> 43:58.219
Yeah, don't have a panic attack.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.989
Um, Mr. Winchell?

44:19.073 --> 44:22.452
-Yes, yes, Mrs...
-Uh, Broderick-Allen.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.329
Yes. Nice to see you.

44:24.412 --> 44:25.496
Yeah, I wouldn't have stopped you,

44:25.580 --> 44:28.708
I don't like to talk to parents
unless it's in the classroom,

44:28.791 --> 44:32.587
but I wanted to tell you,
I think she's a unique woman.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.797
And I think she's gonna turn
Steve's life around.

44:35.590 --> 44:37.842
And I want you to know
I'm committed to help.

44:38.551 --> 44:41.053
That girl, his girlfriend?

44:41.136 --> 44:44.265
No, no. Uh, your, your new wife.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.435
-His what?
-The new Mrs. Winchell.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.563
I'm Mrs. Winchell.

45:01.366 --> 45:03.826
Nancy, Abel,
it's the Winchells.

45:05.453 --> 45:08.956
Now's not the best time.
Prairie's taking a nap.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.791
Oh, I bet she is. Uh...

45:11.417 --> 45:14.337
-We need to talk, Nancy.
-Oh, come in.

45:24.054 --> 45:26.557
Children should
not be exposed to someone

45:26.641 --> 45:28.601
capable of identity theft.

45:28.684 --> 45:31.271
Prairie suffered
a very traumatic experience--

45:31.354 --> 45:34.023
And we've been with you
every step of the way.

45:34.106 --> 45:36.442
But if she's coercing our kids...

45:36.526 --> 45:38.694
Your son is 17, not seven.

45:38.778 --> 45:40.905
And it was
his parent-teachers' conference.

45:42.282 --> 45:43.699
Steve?

45:44.700 --> 45:45.993
I already told you at home.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.454
Tell us again.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.500
She wanted Internet.

45:53.376 --> 45:55.252
And she just came up with the idea.

45:55.336 --> 45:58.047
Said it was a fair trade for a router.
It's no big deal.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.965
She was looking for someone named Homer.

46:00.049 --> 46:03.093
We've been neighbors for years.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.513
You were here for Prairie's homecoming.

46:05.596 --> 46:08.683
Makes no sense your coming over here
slinging accusations.

46:08.766 --> 46:11.894
And we have nothing
but admiration for you and Nancy...

46:17.566 --> 46:18.651
I need help.

46:19.402 --> 46:21.111
What she's doing is disturbing.

46:21.195 --> 46:24.198
She's a grown woman pursuing a boy.

46:24.281 --> 46:27.117
She is not thinking like an adult.

46:27.201 --> 46:29.036
You're in denial, Nancy.

46:30.455 --> 46:32.415
What if this becomes sexual?

46:33.248 --> 46:35.125
-That's a crime.
-Are you kidding me?

46:36.336 --> 46:38.212
First, I have a girlfriend.

46:39.130 --> 46:43.384
And second, this is about just...
just friends.

46:44.218 --> 46:46.721
She doesn't have any friends
and I'm being a friend. That's it.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.181
All this sick weird shit's
coming from your brains.

46:49.264 --> 46:51.809
- Jesus, Steven--
- She impersonated me.

46:51.892 --> 46:53.102
Because I asked her to.

46:53.728 --> 46:57.147
'Cause I wanted someone on my fucking side
for once. And guess what?

46:57.231 --> 46:58.608
It actually helped.

46:58.691 --> 47:01.777
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

47:02.362 --> 47:05.197
You did say, Abel,
the doctors in St. Louis

47:05.280 --> 47:07.241
recommended that she be committed.

47:09.702 --> 47:12.329
You... you talked about that?

47:16.208 --> 47:17.877
They were wrong.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.756
But if the doctors are saying
she needs serious help--

47:21.839 --> 47:24.049
She needs to be home... with us.

47:25.593 --> 47:30.222
And not to be attacked by people who lack
compassion and... and understanding.

47:31.098 --> 47:35.060
Oh, we understand
what it's like to struggle with a child.

47:36.521 --> 47:39.649
We're sending Steve away
to get the help he needs.

47:40.941 --> 47:44.236
Until then, keep her away from him.

47:49.241 --> 47:50.618
Please don't take the camera.

47:54.288 --> 47:57.458
Prairie, I know it's hard,
but it's for the best.

47:59.251 --> 48:02.588
We-- We should have followed the hospital
guidelines from the beginning

48:02.672 --> 48:04.298
to keep you safe.

48:15.726 --> 48:17.978
What am I supposed to do? ID parents?

48:18.604 --> 48:20.230
She's disturbed.

48:20.314 --> 48:22.399
Do you know how I know? Those eyes.

48:22.483 --> 48:24.360
Besides that, she lies.

48:25.194 --> 48:27.655
Oh. Okay, sure.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.156
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

49:10.072 --> 49:11.406
<i>I need help.</i>

49:12.116 --> 49:13.117
<i>I need to--</i>

49:31.802 --> 49:33.428
<i>I need help.</i>

49:33.513 --> 49:36.223
<i>I need to cross a border</i>
<i>that's hard to define.</i>

49:37.057 --> 49:39.310
<i>Maybe you know what I'm talking about?</i>

49:39.393 --> 49:43.522
<i>Or you don't, but... you feel it.</i>

49:48.443 --> 49:52.532
<i>Because you've felt other borders,</i>
<i>like youth and adulthood, maybe.</i>

49:58.704 --> 50:03.083
<i>I can't change your fate...</i>
<i>but I can help you meet it.</i>

50:07.212 --> 50:10.465
<i>We begin our journey</i>
<i>to the border tonight. Midnight.</i>

50:10.550 --> 50:13.803
<i>The unfinished house</i>
<i>at the edge of Crestwood View.</i>

50:13.886 --> 50:16.346
<i>Don't come unless you leave</i>
<i>your front door open.</i>

50:16.430 --> 50:18.390
<i>You have to invite me in.</i>

50:36.826 --> 50:39.704
Michelle, you hungry?

50:39.787 --> 50:42.039
You want me to warm up the spaghetti?

50:42.122 --> 50:45.585
No, I'm just grabbing my textbook
from downstairs. I'm fine.

50:45.668 --> 50:46.711
Okay.

51:00.099 --> 51:01.976
<i>12:20 AM.</i>

51:32.590 --> 51:35.217
Hey, you wanna drink a 40?

51:36.802 --> 51:38.095
Hey, deadbeat.

51:39.138 --> 51:40.389
Hey yourself.

51:41.306 --> 51:44.143
-Heard you punched Miles Brekov.
-From who?

51:44.226 --> 51:45.394
Did you do that because of me?

51:45.477 --> 51:48.898
You really think the world
revolves around you, don't you?

51:48.981 --> 51:51.191
Hey, I'm not the one
drinking alone with my dog.

51:51.275 --> 51:53.944
Oh, please tell me, Jaye,
what should I be doing, huh?

51:54.028 --> 51:56.571
Whoever you did it for,
it's gonna get you kicked out of school.

51:56.656 --> 51:59.700
Was that the plan all along?

51:59.784 --> 52:00.910
Self-destruct?

52:02.119 --> 52:04.664
You really like to kick a guy
when he's down.

52:05.665 --> 52:07.249
Come on, get in.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.043
Chris is having a thing.

52:09.752 --> 52:10.836
Oh, come on, buddy.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.521
Why didn't you want to be my girlfriend?

52:30.189 --> 52:31.315
You're drunk.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.233
Oh, come on.
Look, I'm leaving anyway.

52:34.819 --> 52:36.904
You said you like how I smell.

52:38.989 --> 52:41.033
I wanna get good at sex.

52:41.116 --> 52:43.285
This has been practice.

52:44.244 --> 52:46.997
One day I will fall in love,

52:47.081 --> 52:49.583
and when that happens, I'll be ready.

52:49.666 --> 52:53.170
-That's messed up.
-You're an asshole.

52:53.253 --> 52:55.214
I see you looking at yourself
when we're having sex.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.382
This isn't just about me for you, either.

52:59.218 --> 53:00.510
What?

53:02.137 --> 53:04.431
Fucking invisible self.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.978
How many of those have you had?

53:10.854 --> 53:13.065
Look, I'll spend the night tonight, okay?

53:13.648 --> 53:15.985
If you don't want to be alone?

53:17.152 --> 53:18.487
Yo, this is my house. Pull over.

53:25.661 --> 53:28.330
You're right. I am an asshole.

53:32.167 --> 53:33.753
Yo, keep the 40!

53:49.393 --> 53:50.519
Bye!

54:07.995 --> 54:10.790
Hey, don't turn
the lights out on us, crazy.

54:21.425 --> 54:23.844
Look, my parents flipped.

54:23.928 --> 54:24.929
I'm getting Asheville.

54:25.012 --> 54:26.763
It could be tonight,
it could be next week.

54:26.847 --> 54:29.224
- I'm here anyway, right?
- Right.

54:33.938 --> 54:35.815
But I can't.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.983
Oh, come on, OA. Don't hold a grudge.

54:38.066 --> 54:39.985
I need at least five. I told you.

54:40.652 --> 54:43.322
- We are five.
- Not including me.

54:43.405 --> 54:45.532
Look, just include yourself
and let's get going already.

54:45.615 --> 54:47.159
Okay, what exactly is it
that we're doing here?

54:49.369 --> 54:52.539
I need to... go somewhere,

54:52.622 --> 54:54.416
and I think that you can
help me get there.

54:56.168 --> 54:58.295
But I'll need to leave
something important behind,

54:58.378 --> 55:00.965
and it only works if there are five.

55:01.048 --> 55:03.842
Yo, I'm tired of all this shit, OA. I'm...

55:17.189 --> 55:18.357
Huh.

55:19.441 --> 55:21.443
I left my door open.

55:52.766 --> 55:55.352
<i>I'm gonna tell you</i>
<i>my story from the beginning.</i>

55:56.186 --> 56:00.149
And there will come a point
when you'll see why you're here...

56:00.941 --> 56:02.651
what you might do together,

56:02.734 --> 56:05.946
how you could help people
that you'll never meet.

56:07.656 --> 56:11.285
But you have to pretend to trust me
until you actually do.

56:13.287 --> 56:14.871
I want you to close your eyes.

56:15.915 --> 56:18.208
I want you to imagine
everything I tell you

56:18.292 --> 56:20.419
as if you're there yourself.

56:21.336 --> 56:23.088
As if you're with me.

56:23.172 --> 56:25.132
As if you are me.

56:27.426 --> 56:28.718
Close them.

56:32.889 --> 56:34.641
I imagine with my eyes open.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.186
Okay.

56:37.978 --> 56:39.729
Could you close them for me then?

56:50.865 --> 56:53.618
I was born in Russia, in 1987.

56:53.702 --> 56:55.079
What?

56:55.912 --> 56:57.456
Come on.

57:01.043 --> 57:03.003
My father was a very wealthy man.

57:04.046 --> 57:07.799
He ran a mining company.
He took precious metals out of the ground.

57:09.218 --> 57:11.095
We were always being watched,

57:11.178 --> 57:13.805
because he'd made
so much money so quickly.

57:13.888 --> 57:16.141
And at that time,
if you had that kind of money,

57:16.225 --> 57:17.684
you paid some of it to the Voi.

57:19.769 --> 57:23.857
We lived in a secret enclave
just outside Moscow

57:23.941 --> 57:26.443
with many of the other recent rich.

57:26.526 --> 57:28.988
And the snow was seven feet high,

57:29.071 --> 57:31.865
but you could still make out
many big houses

57:31.948 --> 57:34.826
behind big gates lost in the white.

57:42.792 --> 57:44.919
<i>You asked me how I got my sight.</i>

57:46.088 --> 57:48.965
<i>The better story</i>
<i>is how I lost it in the first place.</i>

57:50.092 --> 57:51.926
<i>I was not born blind.</i>

57:53.220 --> 57:58.058
<i>I remember the bright colored domes</i>
<i>of Saint Basil's Cathedral,</i>

57:58.141 --> 58:00.686
<i>the gray waters of the Moskva River.</i>

58:52.904 --> 58:55.532
<i>Our town was built on the fall.</i>

58:55.615 --> 58:57.992
<i>Each house was a new fortune.</i>

58:58.077 --> 59:00.579
<i>There was the man who drilled oil,</i>
<i>the man who dug coal,</i>

59:00.662 --> 59:02.414
<i>the man who made cable.</i>

59:03.332 --> 59:06.543
<i>I grew up with the sons and daughters</i>
<i>of these oligarchs.</i>

59:11.465 --> 59:13.925
<i>My mother died in childbirth.</i>

59:14.008 --> 59:17.554
<i>It was just my father and I</i>
<i>in a big, lonely house.</i>

59:18.680 --> 59:20.515
<i>I suffered from things then.</i>

59:21.350 --> 59:22.851
<i>Dreams.</i>

59:22.934 --> 59:27.021
<i>They had smells in them</i>
<i>and sounds that were sharper than life.</i>

59:30.525 --> 59:33.278
<i>In one of them,</i>
<i>I'm trapped in an aquarium,</i>

59:33.361 --> 59:36.615
<i>- and I can't breathe, I can't get out.</i>
<i>- </i>Nina!

59:39.618 --> 59:40.827
Papa.

59:41.495 --> 59:42.787
Papa!

59:43.872 --> 59:45.039
Papa!

59:45.749 --> 59:47.209
Nina.

59:47.292 --> 59:49.128
Papa!

59:51.087 --> 59:53.923
It came again. The same again.

59:54.007 --> 59:56.926
I'm underwater and I see
the floating crayons and I can't breathe.

59:57.010 --> 1:00:00.597
It's just a dream, my little cabbage.

1:00:01.181 --> 1:00:02.516
A fantasy.

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:08.021
No. I felt it just like
I feel you pinching my nose.

1:00:11.816 --> 1:00:14.903
Cancel this afternoon.
Move everything to this evening.

1:00:15.904 --> 1:00:18.282
We are going to get rid of this nightmare.

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:29.876
Stop here.

1:00:31.002 --> 1:00:32.629
Keep the car warm.

1:00:43.473 --> 1:00:44.766
Come on, cabbage.

1:01:09.123 --> 1:01:10.166
Nina.

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:12.836
Papa, it's too cold. I can't.

1:01:13.587 --> 1:01:16.881
What's the only way to fight cold?

1:01:17.507 --> 1:01:19.884
Become colder than it is.

1:02:10.352 --> 1:02:12.687
<i>My father taught me</i>
<i>about bravery that day.</i>

1:02:14.147 --> 1:02:19.694
<i>That night, it was so cold,</i>
<i>one of our horses froze to death.</i>

1:02:19.778 --> 1:02:22.531
<i>But the dreams of the aquarium</i>
<i>never came back.</i>

1:02:25.617 --> 1:02:28.703
<i>Months passed.</i>
<i>My nose didn't bleed once.</i>

1:02:41.841 --> 1:02:44.428
<i>I had started school now.</i>

1:02:45.971 --> 1:02:49.391
<i>All the kids in the neighborhood</i>
<i>were picked up on a special bus.</i>

1:02:50.141 --> 1:02:51.851
<i>I was always first.</i>

1:02:57.190 --> 1:03:00.735
<i>I felt something</i>
<i>in the pit of my stomach...</i>

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:04.781
<i>like the eggs</i>
<i>were sitting there stuck, unbroken.</i>

1:03:04.864 --> 1:03:06.950
<i>I felt like I wanted to get off that bus.</i>

1:03:07.033 --> 1:03:11.580
Yeah, but I didn't like it.
It made you think too much about death.

1:03:11.663 --> 1:03:14.165
Like when the boy shoots himself.

1:03:14.248 --> 1:03:19.212
Yeah, like one day you are here,
and then suddenly you aren't here.

1:03:19.296 --> 1:03:21.006
You aren't anywhere.

1:03:21.673 --> 1:03:23.383
Did you see it, Ninny?

1:03:23.467 --> 1:03:25.927
I think you are always somewhere.

1:03:26.010 --> 1:03:27.261
What's wrong with your nose?

1:03:27.887 --> 1:03:29.681
Oh, it's nothing.

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:29.449
There is a light beneath us.

1:04:29.532 --> 1:04:30.992
Maybe one of the windows is broken.

1:04:31.076 --> 1:04:33.953
If we swim deep,
maybe we could make it out.

1:04:36.623 --> 1:04:38.667
Nina! Nina!

1:05:04.358 --> 1:05:06.360
<i>We were a message, see?</i>

1:05:08.697 --> 1:05:10.949
<i>From the Voi to our parents.</i>

1:05:11.032 --> 1:05:14.202
<i>And the message said,</i>
<i>"You are powerful businessmen to be sure,</i>

1:05:14.285 --> 1:05:16.788
<i>but you are not all-powerful."</i>

1:05:20.834 --> 1:05:24.629
The youngest sons and daughters of every
Russian scion was on that bus that day.

1:05:25.630 --> 1:05:29.175
They all died. Every single one of them.

1:05:32.261 --> 1:05:33.763
Including me.

1:05:50.029 --> 1:05:54.033
<i>I couldn't tell if I was</i>
<i>inside the earth or above it.</i>

1:05:55.910 --> 1:05:58.246
<i>Why was the dark so dazzling?</i>

1:06:11.217 --> 1:06:12.260
Nina.

1:06:32.822 --> 1:06:35.199
Do you want to go back?

1:06:39.370 --> 1:06:41.789
You will know great love...

1:06:42.582 --> 1:06:44.834
but it will be very hard.

1:06:46.294 --> 1:06:48.713
You will suffer.

1:06:49.547 --> 1:06:50.632
Me?

1:06:51.716 --> 1:06:54.010
I want you to stay here.

1:06:57.597 --> 1:06:58.973
Back.

1:07:00.308 --> 1:07:01.810
Then...

1:07:01.893 --> 1:07:04.270
I will take your eyes.

1:07:05.354 --> 1:07:12.195
Because I cannot bear for you
to see what lies ahead.

1:07:14.322 --> 1:07:16.157
It's too horrible.

1:07:27.711 --> 1:07:30.964
Papa.

1:07:49.482 --> 1:07:52.318
<i>I could feel his cheek</i>
<i>against mine. It was cold.</i>

1:07:52.401 --> 1:07:54.654
And I could hear his breath.

1:07:55.864 --> 1:07:57.949
And though my eyes were wide open...

1:07:59.618 --> 1:08:01.620
it was black.

1:08:04.288 --> 1:08:06.916
I said, "Papa..."

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.960
I can't see.

1:08:13.548 --> 1:08:15.800
"I can't see anything at all."
