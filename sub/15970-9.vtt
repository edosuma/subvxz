00:01.720 --> 00:05.480
(theme music playing)

01:10.640 --> 01:13.760
(Angela)<i> When I was little,</i>
<i>I, like, worshipped Halloween.</i>

01:13.840 --> 01:17.720
<i>And, truthfully, part of me still does.</i>

01:17.800 --> 01:21.320
<i>'Cause it's your one chance</i>
<i>all year to be someone else.</i>

01:21.400 --> 01:23.360
You're sure you don't want
to wear my flapper dress?

01:23.440 --> 01:26.280
Why do you always ask me
everything 10 times? No.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.760
-(Danielle) I can't be Catwoman!
-Okay. You want cereal?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.720
(Angela)
<i>I want to be someone else.</i>

01:31.800 --> 01:37.240
<i>To wear, like, an actual costume to school</i>
<i>is, like, too scary.</i>

01:37.320 --> 01:40.880
No, thanks. I don't see
the point of wearing a costume.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.280
I can't be Catwoman. Sherry
hickey's going to be Catwoman,

01:44.360 --> 01:46.920
-and she's, like, developed.
-I thought she was going to be Madonna.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
-(telephone rings)
-I'll get it.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.640
She wants to be someone scary.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.320
-Hello?
-Who's scarier than Madonna?

01:53.400 --> 01:55.280
Uh, dad, Madonna peaked.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.800
It's that Boyd guy.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.240
Boyd. No, no. That's all right.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.320
Is that the guy mom hired
to replace you?

02:03.960 --> 02:06.320
No one can replace me. And, yes.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.760
Well, no. Of course. I understand.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.800
-Okay.
-(dog barking in distance)

02:14.880 --> 02:16.040
I'll see you then.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.800
(sighs)
He'll be a little late.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.960
-Chiropractor.
-Again?

02:22.040 --> 02:23.760
-Who should I be?
-Mom?

02:23.840 --> 02:26.640
A pain in the butt, since you are.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.840
I'd be you, but nobody can find
a mask that ugly.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.320
-(scoffs)
-Danielle!

02:37.200 --> 02:39.640
Danielle, let this be a lesson to you.

02:39.720 --> 02:42.880
Don't always leave things
until the last minute.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.720
You want to use
my flapper dress?

02:44.800 --> 02:47.040
You asked me that 10 times.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.800
You know what's happening? I'm sleeping...

02:48.880 --> 02:51.440
Over at Rayanne's. I said you could.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.160
Don't ask me everything 10 times.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.520
-I meant that as a joke.
-Sure.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.000
-(door opens)
-(Patty sighs)

03:01.480 --> 03:03.720
So, you basically feel
like he's working out?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.160
-(door closes)
-Boyd.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.880
(sighs) What can I say?

03:06.960 --> 03:10.200
He's always either coming late
or leaving early.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.920
There's always some chiropractic
adjustment I have to hear about.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.600
I mean, he means well, but...

03:16.760 --> 03:19.000
wait. Who are we going to be?

03:20.360 --> 03:22.800
-When we grow up?
-No!

03:22.880 --> 03:25.440
At Camille's costume party tonight.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.520
I hate Halloween.
Well, you got something.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.120
You can wear that flapper dress.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.120
I hate that flapper dress!

03:32.200 --> 03:34.920
-(bell rings)
-(indistinct chatter)

03:38.240 --> 03:40.360
-Hey, rat.
-Hey, rat girl.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.040
I'm not a rat. I'm a cat.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.040
Hey! Hands off the tail.

03:46.480 --> 03:47.880
Watch your tail.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.080
I'm a cat, okay? Deal with it.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.640
(Angela)
<i>People are wearing costumes.</i>

03:54.720 --> 03:57.760
<i>Even teachers are wearing costumes.</i>

03:57.840 --> 04:01.360
<i>I should've worn a costume.</i>
<i>But who would I be?</i>

04:08.760 --> 04:11.960
I can't believe people are walking
around dressed like idiots.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.720
I wouldn't talk.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.360
Okay, people,
we're starting a new unit this week.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.840
You want to read new books.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.640
You want to study. (chuckles)

04:27.120 --> 04:30.440
Well, uh, in honor of all-saints eve,

04:30.520 --> 04:34.360
we're going to be reading stories
about famous ghosts and spirits.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.440
(class sighs)

04:36.520 --> 04:38.720
Speaking of apparitions, where's Catalano?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.200
Does anybody know Jordan Catalano?

04:42.280 --> 04:45.080
(Angela)
<i>Does anybody know Jordan Catalano?</i>

04:45.840 --> 04:48.200
<i>That question, like, got to me.</i>

04:48.280 --> 04:51.080
<i>I mean, I'd had seven conversations</i>
<i>with him</i>

04:51.160 --> 04:56.040
<i>and one really bad kiss</i>
<i>and one amazing one.</i>

04:56.120 --> 04:57.480
Angela?

04:57.560 --> 05:00.400
(Angela)
<i>But did I, like, know him?</i>

05:01.440 --> 05:02.640
Sort of.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.440
Tell him he better quit ditching class.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.480
I want him here tomorrow,
or he'll be kicked out.

05:07.560 --> 05:11.400
There are too many good kids.
I just don't have time for the bad ones.

05:11.480 --> 05:16.920
-Okay, turn to page seven...
-(bell rings)

05:17.000 --> 05:19.760
(bell ringing)

05:26.360 --> 05:27.560
(door closes)

05:28.480 --> 05:30.800
You know,
this is how drains get clogged.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.280
This is how girls get foamy.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.440
Whoa! Scary costume.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.040
I got it from Brian Krakow.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.800
I thought this Halloween,
I'd be everyone else.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.320
-Angeleeka!
-You're Brian?

05:45.400 --> 05:47.280
Wait till you see
what I brought you.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.720
They're actual. It's not a costume.
They're, like, real.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.080
Look, mohair.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.920
Go try them on.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.840
What, learner handed out
the new book this early?

05:55.920 --> 05:59.040
Somebody's got to do something.
Halloween bites this year.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.600
We got to find Tino.
Tino's Mr. Halloween.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.880
See you on soc.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.600
Oh, good. You're wearing a costume.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.480
'Cause if more people
don't start wearing costumes,

06:07.560 --> 06:09.520
they're going to be, like, discontinued.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.440
-Cute rat suit.
-I'm a cat.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.080
-(door bangs)
-Oh, my God.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.000
That fits you perfect.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.360
We got to do your hair
and makeup.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.440
Don't you like to see
who else had the book...

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
(door closes)

06:22.080 --> 06:23.720
-Nicky Driscoll?
-Lie.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.360
-The Nicky Driscoll?
-See for yourself.

06:27.440 --> 06:31.320
-Who's Nicky Driscoll?
-Unreal. There it is.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.880
Oh, my God.
Didn't he, like, die on Halloween?

06:34.960 --> 06:38.000
He didn't die on Halloween.
That's just a myth.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.600
-He did so.
-Did not.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.640
Who is Nicky Driscoll?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.120
We heard about him freshman year.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.760
It was, like, after this Halloween dance.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.960
He and his friends decided to paint
the gym black, just to do it,

06:51.040 --> 06:52.960
and he was up in the rafters.

06:53.040 --> 06:58.240
And some moron girl leaves her spike
heel right in the middle of the floor.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.600
Don't ask me why?

06:59.680 --> 07:02.120
And so when he fell,

07:02.200 --> 07:07.760
this humongous spike, like, stabbed him
right in the nostril.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.520
-Gross.
-That's disgusting.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.760
Eww! Shut up!

07:12.840 --> 07:16.800
They just tell kids he died like that
so people won't climb the rafters.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.520
-(toilet flushes)
-No. No, it's true.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.560
Our moms even know about him.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.840
It was the Halloween right
before Kennedy got shot.

07:24.920 --> 07:30.480
I heard he was hanging this banner
that declared his love for some girl.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.360
Nicky Driscoll.
This couldn't really be his book.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.400
-It's a prank.
-Look, it's, like, faded.

07:38.320 --> 07:42.200
He and my uncle's friend
were in the same class,

07:42.280 --> 07:44.440
and my uncle said the night he died

07:44.520 --> 07:46.960
there was this storm
and the electricity went out.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.320
The next day,
they found out the electricity went out

07:51.400 --> 07:56.320
at the exact same time that Nicky died.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.720
My mom's sister once rode
on the back of his bike.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.280
She was, like, 12
and said she was 15.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.040
Those are her clothes.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.360
-Do you want to stuff?
-Rayanne.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.000
This is the way they did it
in the old days.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.960
Ricky, you look good without makeup.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.640
(serene music playing)

08:18.720 --> 08:21.320
(humming "Blue Moon")

08:26.560 --> 08:28.600
Oh, Ricky. It has pockets.

08:30.920 --> 08:35.680
-Oh, Ricky, look.
-Oh, wow. That's so cool.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.040
-What else do you know about him?
-About who?

08:39.120 --> 08:41.160
You know, Nicky Catalano.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.680
-You mean, Nicky Driscoll?
-Why, what'd I say?

08:44.760 --> 08:46.000
Never mind.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.440
I don't know much
about either of them.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.160
-So, you coming to soc?
-In a minute.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.480
(indistinct conversations)

09:03.800 --> 09:06.400
-(bell dings)
-(Victrola playing in background)

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
Wow.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.400
I told you there was a shop here.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.840
(sighs)

09:12.360 --> 09:14.960
Do you think I'll have to fire him?

09:15.960 --> 09:18.040
Boyd? You're kidding?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.800
It's just not working out. I mean...

09:22.880 --> 09:26.040
-Hi. I...
-Please don't say you want <i>Power Rangers.</i>

09:26.120 --> 09:27.960
We're out. Everybody's out.

09:28.040 --> 09:31.160
Her friend's having a costume party.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.120
-Camille is our friend.
-Not when she's having a costume party.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.280
-I love your costume.
-What costume?

09:38.880 --> 09:40.680
I got just what you need.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.880
Rapunsel.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.120
(mellow music playing)

09:50.200 --> 09:52.600
-And a pirate.
-(chuckling)

09:52.680 --> 09:55.800
-What's so funny?
-You as Rapunsel.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.040
I mean, come on...

09:59.240 --> 10:01.400
not that... well, you know.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.400
Actually, you know,
I don't see myself in tights.

10:05.480 --> 10:10.280
I would rather not be
a storybook character... if possible.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.120
Today's Halloween.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.320
Yesterday I coulda got you
Bill and Hillary.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
Let this be a lesson.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.440
Don't always leave things
till the last minute.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.520
We'll take them.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.600
Should we try them on or something?

10:23.680 --> 10:26.920
Look, doll face,
I been doing this for a lot of years.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.560
They'll fit like a glove, trust me.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.320
-(bell rings)
-(indistinct chatter)

10:34.400 --> 10:36.680
(dramatic music playing)

11:01.720 --> 11:05.000
It's a costume.
I wouldn't really dress like this.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.000
-I'm supposed to give you a message.
-From Tino?

11:09.080 --> 11:12.600
-No. From Miss Learner.
-Who?

11:12.680 --> 11:16.960
Miss learner... our English
teacher for over a month now.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.400
She says you have
to start showing up...

11:21.120 --> 11:24.920
to class, or she's going
to have you kicked out.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.000
So, what's the message?

11:27.080 --> 11:29.640
That you'll get kicked out of school.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.520
Like it's doing so much for me.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.640
You're welcome.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.600
Don't you even care?

11:39.680 --> 11:42.840
I'm having a brain hemorrhage.
This is such a great idea.

11:42.920 --> 11:47.000
I can't even communicate with him.

11:47.080 --> 11:50.320
Will you forget Catalano?
I finally got something going.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.560
I told Tino about your book,

11:52.640 --> 11:58.120
so we're going to meet here tonight
outside the school at like, nine,

11:58.200 --> 12:01.280
'cause it's a witchy number,
and we're going to contact

12:01.360 --> 12:04.000
the spirit of Nicky Driscoll.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.560
Finally... it's Halloween.

12:07.640 --> 12:12.760
Awooo! Awooo! Awooo! Awooo!
(laughs)

12:13.960 --> 12:17.840
(dramatic music playing)

12:27.640 --> 12:30.440
(suspenseful music playing)

12:39.320 --> 12:40.880
(Angela)
<i>When someone dies young,</i>

12:40.960 --> 12:45.800
<i>it's like they stay that way... forever.</i>

12:50.440 --> 12:52.400
<i>Like a vampire.</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:54.240
(suspenseful music continues playing)

13:02.680 --> 13:03.800
(Angela gasps)

13:04.680 --> 13:06.520
Oh. He's just your type.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.720
Watch out for dead guys.
They'll break your heart.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.720
I wanted to see what he looked like.

13:11.800 --> 13:15.120
You'll be there tonight, right?
I mean, since he contacted you.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.320
-Rayanne, stop.
-(Rayanne sighs)

13:19.640 --> 13:21.560
I still can't look at him.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.520
If he were alive today,
he'd be...

13:24.600 --> 13:25.600
Who, Nicky?

13:25.680 --> 13:30.400
That's easy. Some burnt-out greaser
with no teeth and a parole officer.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.280
Oh, Rayanne, that's so unfair.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.560
It seems like some people
have to die young.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.920
-Like it fits them or something.
-(humming "Blue Moon")

13:40.000 --> 13:42.120
Why are you singing that song?

13:42.200 --> 13:44.840
'Cause Rickie was, I guess.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.920
Angela, we have to do this.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.680
I don't know.
It seems like such a sick idea.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.680
So what's the downside?

13:53.280 --> 13:54.960
I mean, contact him?

13:55.040 --> 13:58.440
How?
I have trouble contacting living guys.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.280
I don't even believe in ghosts.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.080
Yeah, right.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.560
That's why you ran here
to check his picture.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.200
-I'll see you tonight.
-Shh!

14:08.280 --> 14:09.840
I'm leaving. Keep your shroud on.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.800
Angela and Nicky sitting in a tree...

14:13.680 --> 14:15.280
I heard. Count me out.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.920
-(engine starts)
-Oh. Nice and open-minded.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.240
-Did those clothes go to your brain?
-Uh, Rickie.

14:20.320 --> 14:24.120
-You know you want to.
-Can I talk to Rickie?

14:24.200 --> 14:25.520
What am I, a receptionist?

14:26.360 --> 14:30.040
It's no big deal.
About the clothes?

14:30.120 --> 14:32.000
You can return them whenever...

14:33.000 --> 14:34.400
if you need to keep them longer.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.920
Why would he need to keep them longer?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.720
The point of him wearing them
is that he'd never wear them.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.840
She got out of the wrong side
of the coffin this morning.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.800
(scoffs) Come on!

14:44.880 --> 14:48.200
Help me figure out, like, what we bring.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.680
I haven't raised the dead recently.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.200
-Oh, like I have.
-So you guys are like...

14:53.280 --> 14:56.760
-is there a party or something?
-Tino will know.

14:56.840 --> 15:00.600
Tino and the forces of darkness
are like that.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.040
I'm still counting on you,
Vasquez.

15:03.120 --> 15:06.800
We will meet back here tonight,
nine o'clock, this very spot.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.120
-Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!
-Some crazy plan.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.520
Yeah, I figured.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.360
So, by "we," did she mean...

15:16.440 --> 15:18.840
I mean, who exactly
did she mean?

15:18.920 --> 15:21.840
Be glad you're not doing it.
It involves a ghost.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.520
-It's a terrible idea.
-'Cause you don't believe in ghosts?

15:24.600 --> 15:25.880
No. Because I do.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.640
I'll return your clothes tomorrow.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.920
-I'll even wash them and everything.
-(engine starts)

15:31.000 --> 15:32.840
Oh, wait. Be careful.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.840
You have to wash the pants separate.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.080
I decided to make pumpkin soup.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.920
I can't even bear
to look at him anymore. Boyd.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.760
I've got to tell him he's fired.
Somehow.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.280
Is this like when there's a spider
and you expect me to kill it for you?

15:54.360 --> 15:56.160
What? (scoffs)

15:56.240 --> 15:59.200
Nobody's expecting you to kill anything.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.760
You're not involved
in the business anymore.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.920
I've accepted that. (sighs)

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
The longer I put it off,
the worse it gets.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.120
I've just got to do it.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.440
It needs something.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.720
I thought you'd already gone off
with Courtney.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.760
Camille is sending Sharon over
to pick up this chafing dish.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.760
Will you give it to her?

16:24.960 --> 16:28.240
Mom, Sharon Cherski and I exist

16:28.320 --> 16:30.680
in, like, two different worlds, okay?

16:30.760 --> 16:33.360
I can't just hand her a dish, okay?

16:33.440 --> 16:35.720
I mean, it's just not that simple.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.360
(dog barking indistinctly)

16:41.960 --> 16:43.800
I'm doing Angela.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.480
Pretty good, huh?

16:45.560 --> 16:49.080
I thought it was starting all over again.

16:49.160 --> 16:54.200
-Very convincing.
-My God, that was really scary.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.920
Your mother and I have to change
into our idiotic costumes,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.040
so, uh, you be back over
at Courtney's by ten o'clock.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.280
Ten o'clock? On Halloween?

17:03.360 --> 17:05.960
Very good. It sounded just like Angela.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.880
-That was me.
-Ten o'clock.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.080
(dogs barking in distance)

17:13.800 --> 17:16.360
It's a shame.
He seemed like such a nice guy.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.240
Doesn't change anything though.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.720
Just seems...
you can't expect him to be perfect.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.400
I'm not perfect.
You didn't fire me.

17:25.680 --> 17:29.280
-Oh. Well...
-Technically I did.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.760
-Technically... you did.
-Check out the wig.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.280
Oh, I can't handle this.

17:34.360 --> 17:39.640
-Nobody is asking you to fire him.
-No, I mean this. They're purple.

17:40.840 --> 17:41.880
I kind of like them.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.360
The point is, I hired someone.
(sighs)

17:46.440 --> 17:49.840
It's not working.
I'll deal with it.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.880
God, I can hardly breathe.

17:52.960 --> 17:58.000
I just hope... I mean, suppose
his kids suddenly need braces

17:58.080 --> 18:03.200
-or something, you know? This is wrong.
-It has to be this way.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.880
I mean... he means well, but...

18:08.200 --> 18:10.920
this is so tight.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.480
It's not that I wouldn't do it for you.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.560
Because if you want me to do it...

18:16.640 --> 18:17.840
It's just that...

18:18.440 --> 18:20.920
it's so scary to have to fire someone.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.480
(serene music playing)

18:26.000 --> 18:28.760
There are worse things
in this world, believe me.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.280
(Patty sighs)

18:30.360 --> 18:34.280
I just can't help picturing
his poor little children...

18:35.120 --> 18:38.960
without braces. (deep sigh)

18:39.040 --> 18:43.440
-If only there was some way out.
-Forget those little rug rats.

18:44.280 --> 18:49.520
He leaves early to go to the chiropractor,
I'll fire him myself, the filthy cur.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.040
Graham.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.600
That sounds so...

18:56.760 --> 18:57.960
cutthroat.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.000
Well, all is fair in love and war.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.360
(dramatic music playing)

19:07.320 --> 19:09.080
-(doorbell rings)
-(door opens)

19:09.160 --> 19:12.600
-Hi.
-The chafing dish is in here.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.240
(kids indistinctly)
Trick or treat.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.080
What are you,
a mouse or something?

19:17.160 --> 19:20.000
(sighs) Yeah. I'm a mouse.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.680
Oh, my God! You're Angela!

19:24.840 --> 19:28.000
-I can't talk about it, okay?
-Only...

19:28.880 --> 19:31.960
Angela would stand more like...

19:32.920 --> 19:33.920
this.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.200
Like the shirt's her only friend
or something.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.560
Well, I got to go.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.240
Oh. Trick-or-treating, huh?

19:41.320 --> 19:44.880
There's this house on Rossmore,
and they made, like, a haunted house.

19:44.960 --> 19:48.360
Then on Courtney's street,
they give really good candy.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.240
-Where are you going?
-Out. With my boyfriend.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.800
Wow.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.280
-Well, bye.
-Bye.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.720
(door opens, closes)

20:09.120 --> 20:11.360
-(door opens, closes)
-Danielle, wait.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.480
(suspenseful music playing)

20:23.760 --> 20:26.720
Angela.
Angela.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.920
(gasps) What are you doing here?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Nothing.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.000
-It's public property.
-(Rayanne sighs)

20:34.560 --> 20:36.000
I'm locked out of my house.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.640
-Where's...where's Angela?
-(Rayanne sighs)

20:38.720 --> 20:41.080
She said she heard something
or something.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.760
-I think I spooked her.
-What are you doing here?

20:43.840 --> 20:46.960
-It's public property.
-I left my keys in your pants.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.200
(laughs)

20:48.280 --> 20:51.080
-I mean, in my pants.
-(Rayanne chuckles)

20:51.160 --> 20:54.080
I guess it was the wind.
I mean, I heard something.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.440
You're here?

20:56.520 --> 20:59.560
-He left his keys in Rickie's pants.
-Oh, no.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.840
(both laugh)

21:08.360 --> 21:11.040
-Let's go!
-Feel my bag.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.040
Feel mine.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.880
I can't believe I almost missed this.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.880
Promise me you won't let boys
drain the fun out of your life.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.240
I promise. I wish you were my sister.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.040
-Danielle.
-I hate her.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.000
I do.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.480
Okay. You hate her.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.680
So... why'd you want to be her,
if you hate her so much?

21:35.840 --> 21:37.800
I'll trade you this jawbreaker
for that sucker.

21:37.880 --> 21:38.960
Deal.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.520
(Sharon chuckles)

21:43.320 --> 21:45.760
This is the last time
I'll listen to Tino.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.160
It's weird to be here at night.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.080
-Who's Tino?
-A dead man.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.960
It's Halloween!

21:54.640 --> 21:57.880
I say...
I say we break into school

21:57.960 --> 22:02.600
and write, "Nicky Driscoll was here"
on the gym floor in red lipstick.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.560
-That's a terrible idea.
-Come on! We'll be legendary.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.720
They won't forget us.
We'll be like Nicky.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.920
-Excuse me. Nicky got killed.
-Come on, Rayanne.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.680
There's no way we could break in
without setting off the alarm.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.840
There's got to be a way.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.320
I'll ask Brian.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.520
Brian knows some clever chess club way,
don't you?

22:27.240 --> 22:28.760
-Oh, my God.
-What?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.280
-What?
-You know a way in.

22:31.360 --> 22:35.000
-I do not.
-I don't believe it.

22:35.080 --> 22:39.160
Oh, but, Brian,
you could never risk such a risk.

22:39.240 --> 22:42.240
-Could you, Mr. Brilliant future?
-Shut up.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.200
My life's complicated enough.
Count me out.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.880
We're going in with you or without you.

22:48.600 --> 22:53.720
If it's without you, then we'll have to
get in and out before the cops come.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.160
(clock chimes)

22:58.600 --> 23:00.200
(metal thuds)

23:02.160 --> 23:05.120
Man... an a-v graveyard.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.720
-Whoa!
-Why are you doing this?

23:09.800 --> 23:12.920
What about you?
Let go of my arm.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.040
You could get into trouble.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.440
You could screw up your whole life.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.840
At least... at least I'll know I'm alive.

23:20.920 --> 23:24.040
Hey, maybe the cafeteria's
unlocked. Come on!

23:24.120 --> 23:27.520
-(Rayanne chuckles)
-(door shrieks)

23:29.640 --> 23:33.400
We're in! Whoo-hoo! Ow!

23:33.480 --> 23:37.800
(suspenseful music playing)

23:46.480 --> 23:49.640
-(door shuts)
-What the hell was that?

23:51.040 --> 23:55.920
-Oh, no. No. No!
-Let me think.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.920
-You locked us in!
-Shut up! Let me think.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.920
Okay. I know where the computer
is for the security system.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.880
I'll shut off the system,

24:08.960 --> 24:12.160
and then we can leave through another
exit without triggering the alarm.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.680
-Were you looking at me?
-No!

24:18.080 --> 24:21.080
-Where's Angela?
-There she is. Angela!

24:21.160 --> 24:24.280
Meet us in the gym.
We got something to take care of.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.240
(suspenseful music playing)

24:29.040 --> 24:30.120
(door closes)

24:30.920 --> 24:34.400
Come on. Did you do it yet?
Krakow, huh?

24:34.480 --> 24:37.080
-Will you please...
-(alarm blaring silently)

24:37.160 --> 24:40.800
Hey, turn them back on. Krakow!

24:40.880 --> 24:43.280
Joke's over.
Turn the lights back on.

24:44.920 --> 24:48.160
There must be...
some aspect of the system

24:48.240 --> 24:50.480
I'm not... familiar with.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.640
("Blue Moon" plays)

24:59.680 --> 25:02.280

25:24.680 --> 25:27.000

This is the last time
I let them use my 45s.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.000
They scratched my Mathis
and my Ricky Nelson.

25:44.680 --> 25:48.760
-So, Nicky never showed, huh?
-I don't care.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.000
Did they scratch your Elvis?

26:59.240 --> 27:02.400
Oh. Sorry. Public property.

27:04.640 --> 27:08.720
-Well, I... I was just leaving, so...
-Wish I was.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.040
Every year, we come out here,

27:13.120 --> 27:16.840
we tear up the track,
and throw garbage cans over.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.400
God. It's getting old.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.920
-Well, can't you just go?
-No. No.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.480
We still got to find the guy
who egged Tino's car.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.400
That's like...
something I can't get out of.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.280
-(garbage cans clatter)
-(guys laughing)

27:33.360 --> 27:35.000
It's always the same.

27:37.040 --> 27:41.200
But you come because
you think... you know...

27:42.560 --> 27:44.360
maybe something cool
will happen.

27:45.480 --> 27:48.640
'Cause what if something did...
happen...

27:50.400 --> 27:52.280
-and you missed it?

27:53.440 --> 27:55.840

-You better get out of here.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.920
These guys are pretty ripped.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.280

-Yeah.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.840
-Probably stole it off somebody's grave.
-Connie!

28:25.920 --> 28:28.760
He and those creepos he hangs out
with went to the cemetery tonight.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.840
So? He really likes you.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.400
I don't care if he does.
He's a loser, Ruthie.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.160
Nicky Driscoll's going nowhere.
I'm not going with him.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.400
Thank you.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.720
-Can I have one more piece? Thank you.
-Happy Halloween.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.600

30:29.440 --> 30:32.560
-Happy Halloween.
-Good night. Bye.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.760
All set. You got the car keys?

30:37.400 --> 30:38.560
Yeah.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.760
(dramatic music playing)

30:46.880 --> 30:51.360

31:13.120 --> 31:16.600
Trick or treat! Whoa!

31:16.680 --> 31:22.480
(dramatic music playing)

31:28.520 --> 31:34.920
No. Leave the tights on,
just a few minutes more. Please.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.040
-We got to find Angela.
-We can't.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.640
We looked. Get over it.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.960
So dark.
Why does it got to be so dark?

31:46.040 --> 31:50.520
-It's your fault. You were looking at me.
-You were scoping my legs

31:50.600 --> 31:52.520
and let the stupid door shut.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.120
You must be so hard up.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.200
-Where you going?
-Anywhere you're not.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.720
Brian. Brian, don't go!

32:04.160 --> 32:05.040
I'm scared.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.240
I'm scared of the dark, okay?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.800
Have fun telling
all your little friends.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.640
You are?

32:16.840 --> 32:19.760
-I mean, it just...
-(water dripping)

32:21.640 --> 32:24.640
doesn't seem like...
something you'd be.

32:24.720 --> 32:28.440
Yeah, well, I am. (sighs)

32:30.000 --> 32:32.600
Is there a reason... why?

32:38.120 --> 32:41.000
'Cause when I was a kid...

32:41.840 --> 32:45.000
my dad would come home,
wigged out of his mind...

32:46.600 --> 32:48.680
and he'd lock me
in the basement.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.000
Oh, my God.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.840
I'd sleep at the foot
of the stairs 'cause...

32:53.560 --> 32:56.600
if I pressed my face against the floor,

32:56.680 --> 33:00.520
I could see the light
that we left on in the hallway.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.640
But if I turned around...

33:07.480 --> 33:09.160
it would be...

33:14.280 --> 33:15.480
so dark.

33:19.680 --> 33:23.840
(Rayanne laughs)

33:23.920 --> 33:27.560
-You bought that.
-You are sick.

33:28.880 --> 33:34.800
Well, you... you expected
this big explanation. (laughing)

33:36.040 --> 33:38.400
I don't know why I'm scared
of the dark.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.960
My dad never came home,
so that had nothing to do with it.

33:45.760 --> 33:49.520
-I saw you watching me.
-I'm just...when?

33:49.600 --> 33:51.800
Today. Shaving my legs.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.040
Well, yeah. Um... look, I'm...

33:56.800 --> 34:00.080
my hobby is photography.
So I'm, like, trained.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.920
To notice stuff.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.160
Being the stuff people notice
is...

34:07.080 --> 34:08.760
is, like, my hobby.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.640
I mean, I live for it.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.720
Just don't leave me alone here,
okay?

34:16.960 --> 34:18.160
Okay.

34:19.200 --> 34:22.520
(intense music playing)

34:25.880 --> 34:29.120
It's a kick. Billy, come on.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.440
You're getting soft on me.
It's that homecoming brat.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.960
Come on, Nick.
We gotta hang principal jerkface.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.160
Why? Why?

34:37.240 --> 34:39.560
-'Cause we gotta do it.
-You're crazy.

34:39.640 --> 34:40.880
I'm doing it for us.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.600
He can't get away
with kicking us out of school.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.680
Billy, come on. Forget it, man.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.240
(intense music playing)

34:58.240 --> 34:59.920
Yeah. Yeah.

35:00.680 --> 35:01.880
Yeah, so...

35:03.360 --> 35:06.400
I'm at Brad's right now,
and he's pretty sick.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.200
But I really shouldn't leave him.

35:10.880 --> 35:14.080
-Um, his parents?
-They're out of town.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.120
They're out of town.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.280
Well, no, we're not unsupervised.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.960
-His grandmother's here.
-His grandmother's here...

35:24.040 --> 35:27.000
-But she's asleep.
-...but she's asleep.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.320
So I really should stay.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.520
Yeah, I'll call you in the morning.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.600
-No, don't call here.
-You'll wake their grandmother.

35:35.680 --> 35:39.640
Oh, you'll wake up his grandma,
and...

35:40.520 --> 35:44.120
she's... exhausted.
She needs rest.

35:46.440 --> 35:50.880
Uh, mom... mom, mom,
I'll call you in the morning. Yes.

35:51.840 --> 35:52.720
Okay.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.120
(water dripping)

36:04.600 --> 36:09.280
("Blue Moon" plays)

36:10.320 --> 36:13.080
-I like this song.
-I know.

36:14.720 --> 36:18.160
You know, I heard Elvis was
only our age when he recorded this.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.240
Where'd you get the flower?

36:24.120 --> 36:26.720
-I, uh...
-She threw it away, huh?

36:28.200 --> 36:31.440
Yeah, well...
I'm out of her league.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.120
She thinks I'm a loser.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.120
-No.
-What do you mean "no"?

36:37.840 --> 36:39.160
She's right.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.920
Wait. Where are you going?

36:43.800 --> 36:46.520
-Going to help a friend do something.
-No, don't. Please don't.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.120
I got to now.
Can't get out of it.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.560
No. You're going to get hurt.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.880
-At least I'll know I'm alive.
-You're not. You're not alive.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.600
You threw your life away
for no reason.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.800
-See ya.
-No! Wait!

37:00.480 --> 37:04.800
Nicky, wait! (echo)

37:06.920 --> 37:10.240
(suspenseful music playing)

37:40.080 --> 37:44.800
(birds chirping, dogs barking at distance)

38:14.280 --> 38:15.280
Hey.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.240
-No more candy.
-Mom, I know.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.360
Bet you, you're glad
to be yourself again, huh?

38:24.080 --> 38:26.240
Better get out of your sister's room.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.720
(serene music playing)

39:01.480 --> 39:02.640
-Aah!
-Aah!

39:02.720 --> 39:04.440
-Aah!
-Aah!

39:05.480 --> 39:06.840
Angela.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.600
-Nicky?
-Very funny.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.160
Man... you sleep like this
stoner I knew.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.440
He was, like, dead.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.280
We had to check his breath
with a mirror.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.720
I've tried to wake you
for five minutes.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.720
We got to jam
before everyone gets here.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.320
Oh, that's cool. George is my man.
He won't tell,

39:24.400 --> 39:27.920
'cause there's nothing to tell,
'cause we were never here. Right, George?

39:29.600 --> 39:30.880
Come on.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.960
Sorry we didn't show, Camille.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.640
No, it must've been something
we ate,

39:37.720 --> 39:40.880
because suddenly something
just... came over us.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.920
Anyway, I'm sorry
we didn't make it.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.720
I wouldn't say we didn't make it.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.800
I'm sorry. What? Camille?

39:47.880 --> 39:52.400
No, no. Of course,
we had costumes. We were all set to go.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.480
Bill and Hillary.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.560
-Okay. I'll talk to you later.
-(slams telephone)

39:58.640 --> 40:00.720
Why'd you tell Camille
we were the Clintons?

40:00.800 --> 40:05.200
(scoffs) I don't know.
It just... seemed easier.

40:05.800 --> 40:06.800
I mean...

40:07.560 --> 40:10.800
what is the deal with Rapunsel anyway?

40:10.880 --> 40:13.000
Is she a princess?

40:13.080 --> 40:15.480
Is she under a spell? I mean...

40:15.560 --> 40:20.160
all anybody ever remembers is
that she had this really long hair,

40:20.240 --> 40:22.640
and she was locked up
in some kind of a...

40:22.720 --> 40:23.720
Prison.

40:25.800 --> 40:28.920
She let her hair down...
and he climbs...

40:30.480 --> 40:32.360
and climbs and climbs.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.560
This bodice is ripped.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.880
Wow. I did that?

40:38.960 --> 40:41.440
I guess you don't know
your own strength.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.960
Patty, you want me to fire that guy?

40:45.480 --> 40:47.200
Part of me wants you to.

40:47.960 --> 40:50.040
Part of me wants you to want me to.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.200
-(Patty chuckles)
-(telephone rings)

40:55.000 --> 40:55.960
Hello?

40:57.040 --> 40:58.160
Oh, hello, Boyd.

41:01.280 --> 41:04.560
Boyd, um, there's something
that I've got to say

41:04.640 --> 41:09.360
and there's really no great way
to say it, so...

41:10.640 --> 41:11.880
I'm just going to say it...

41:12.600 --> 41:14.000
because, um...

41:15.520 --> 41:16.600
the truth is, Boyd,

41:16.680 --> 41:18.920
I don't think you're
the right person for this job.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.560
Well, I'm sorry.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.240
Nobody likes to hear these things.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.640
It's never fun, but, um...

41:25.720 --> 41:28.840
in my experience, you've just got to.
Face it.

41:30.160 --> 41:34.000
Well, no. I didn't see it
coming either, but...

41:36.240 --> 41:37.400
Hey, Brian.

41:37.480 --> 41:40.480
Um, here's your clothes.
I washed them, cold.

41:41.680 --> 41:42.920
You will not believe...

41:43.520 --> 41:45.360
you will not believe
what we did last night.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.680
Yeah, I know.
Rayanne told me all about it.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.720
-I should've done it, right?
-So...

41:51.920 --> 41:53.800
what did Rayanne say happened?

41:53.880 --> 41:56.600
Actually, she said that
nothing happened, that it was...

41:57.200 --> 41:58.640
a total waste of time.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.320
Well...

42:03.920 --> 42:05.600
yeah. It was.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.800
-(bell rings)
-(locker door slams)

42:09.880 --> 42:12.080
(indistinct conversations)

42:19.760 --> 42:20.840
(bell dings)

42:20.920 --> 42:22.360
Hi.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.520
I'd like to return these.

42:25.400 --> 42:30.280
-There was a... slight accident.
-Bodice get ripped?

42:31.160 --> 42:32.560
Yes...

42:32.640 --> 42:36.320
as a matter of fact. Why?
Has that happened before?

42:36.400 --> 42:39.480
Happens every time.
That's Rapunsel for you.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.720
I'll, pay you for the damage.

42:44.800 --> 42:48.240
No charge. No damage.
No harm done.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.880
Well, thank you.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.800
I was wondering...

42:53.760 --> 42:56.120
do you ever... I mean...

42:56.800 --> 42:59.200
-(Patty chuckles nervously)
-You want to keep the costumes?

42:59.960 --> 43:01.200
Well, I was...

43:02.560 --> 43:06.280
-I was... thinking... about it.
-Of course, you were.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.480
I don't really know that I'd...

43:09.520 --> 43:11.520
actually it seems kind of silly.

43:11.600 --> 43:16.040
Actually, I mean...
Halloween is over, and...

43:16.680 --> 43:20.600
what would we do with them
for the rest of the year? I...

43:21.400 --> 43:24.560
it wouldn't... better not.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.400
You're the boss.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.840
-Where's the handkerchief?
-(cars honking)

43:29.920 --> 43:31.800
What? You mean it isn't in here?

43:32.440 --> 43:36.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know, um, what...

43:38.880 --> 43:40.400
(sighs) what...

43:42.160 --> 43:43.720
happened to it.

43:44.960 --> 43:48.120
-That I'll have to charge you for.
-Of course.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.240
(mellow music playing)

43:51.800 --> 43:53.560
(indistinct conversations)

43:56.160 --> 43:57.760
(bell rings)

43:59.600 --> 44:02.120
(indistinct conversations)

44:16.000 --> 44:19.440
-You're not going to class?
-What's it to you?

44:21.320 --> 44:22.880
You know, you're going
to get expelled.

44:24.880 --> 44:26.200
Don't you care?

44:26.960 --> 44:29.480
-It don't matter.
-Of course, it matters.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.760
She's looking to throw me out, okay?
She's been waiting for this.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.200
She thinks I'm a loser.

44:37.280 --> 44:39.400
You're crazy to let her tell you
what you are.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.960
What are you talking about?

44:41.560 --> 44:44.280
She doesn't know you.
She doesn't know who you are.

44:44.360 --> 44:48.200
-You can't let her decide what you do.
-I decide what I do!

44:48.280 --> 44:49.480
Maybe I want to get kicked out.

44:49.560 --> 44:53.480
It doesn't mean people can't try
and stop you and tell you.

44:58.680 --> 45:02.680
I know you think,
how could someone like me understand?

45:04.240 --> 45:05.480
Only I do.

45:09.480 --> 45:13.120
(footsteps receding)

45:15.680 --> 45:16.920
Okay, people.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.600
Come on.
Let's try to look alive.

45:18.680 --> 45:20.840
I know we all have candy hangovers.

45:20.920 --> 45:25.960
Today we are going to be visiting
Mr. Dickens' world of dark factories,

45:26.040 --> 45:28.680
gray skies, lost souls.

45:29.560 --> 45:33.800
Ah, speaking of which, Mr. Catalano,
how nice to see you.

45:33.880 --> 45:37.200
Are you just visiting, or are you
going to stay with us for a while?

45:37.280 --> 45:39.320
(upbeat music playing)

45:42.160 --> 45:45.600
All right, people.
If you would turn to page 27.

45:46.120 --> 45:49.040
Now, who would like to start
the reading today?

45:49.120 --> 45:51.760
Oh, come on, people.
I know we're all tired,

45:51.840 --> 45:54.120
but I had far more chocolate
than you did.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.360
Let's get into
the spirit of things...

45:56.440 --> 45:58.200
(upbeat music continues playing)

46:22.000 --> 46:24.200
(theme music playing)
