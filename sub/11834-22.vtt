00:00.834 --> 00:02.368
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:02.402 --> 00:03.703
Thirty years?

00:03.737 --> 00:05.772
It's not unreasonable,
Jackie, for two murders.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.373
The punishment is life,

00:07.407 --> 00:09.109
and you're looking
at a double life sentence.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.311
Do you see the man
who was shooting that day?

00:11.344 --> 00:13.113
It was the defendant.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.115
Let the record reflect
the witness has identified

00:15.148 --> 00:16.449
the defendant
Jackie Cahill.

00:16.482 --> 00:18.118
This D. A.-- He knows us,
and I know him.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.120
He is not going
to drop the ball.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.255
Richard Bay,
in addition to being good,

00:22.288 --> 00:24.390
he is pathologically
competitive.

00:24.424 --> 00:26.827
He'd want you to get life
even if you were innocent.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.363
Is somebody there?

00:30.396 --> 00:31.364
Ooh!

00:31.397 --> 00:33.099
MAN: This is simple--

00:33.133 --> 00:35.268
If the case
against Jackie Cahill

00:35.301 --> 00:36.402
doesn't go away...

00:36.436 --> 00:38.672
you will.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.614
Our client would like to reopen
the plea negotiation.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.282
Forty years.

00:49.315 --> 00:50.651
The deal you offered
was 30.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.285
That was before
I had to go to trial.

00:52.318 --> 00:53.620
If he really thought
I killed two people,

00:53.654 --> 00:55.589
what does he think
I'm going to do to him

00:55.622 --> 00:58.124
if he convicts me, hmm?
If he's not afraid of that,

00:58.158 --> 01:00.260
he must think I can't get
to him from prison.

01:00.293 --> 01:03.597
Are you going to do something
to him if you lose here?

01:03.630 --> 01:05.165
He has to think I will.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.100
Why?

01:07.133 --> 01:10.303
Because it's my only chance.

01:10.336 --> 01:13.306
The killer is this man
right here.

01:13.339 --> 01:16.242
You're a coward,
and thanks to the jury,

01:16.276 --> 01:18.545
you're about to get
what you deserve.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.446
Commonwealth
v. Jackson Cahill--

01:20.480 --> 01:23.283
We find the defendant
Jackson Cahill

01:23.316 --> 01:24.885
guilty.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.554
Bobby, can you start
working on my appeal, please?

01:27.588 --> 01:29.255
Jackie,
I think you need

01:29.289 --> 01:31.291
to get yourself
another lawyer.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.139
MAN: Okay, let's roll him back
so we can get some vitals.

01:46.172 --> 01:48.208
MAN #2: I've got traction.
Watch his airway.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.443
MAN #3: We got multiple
gunshot wounds on the chest.

01:50.476 --> 01:52.345
We got no lung sounds
on the right.

01:52.378 --> 01:53.714
-Okay, you have the neck?
-Got it.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.348
Okay, roll him out.

01:55.381 --> 01:56.917
-I want to see him.
-Helen--

01:56.950 --> 01:58.585
-Let me see him.
-Let's just stay back here.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.253
-Helen!
-Let me see him!

02:00.286 --> 02:02.288
Just wait.
Just wait.

02:02.322 --> 02:04.625
Liz, go and start bagging him.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.192
(overlapping chatter)

02:12.298 --> 02:14.735
What are you showing
on the monitor, Kevin?

02:14.768 --> 02:16.336
It's a sinus tack.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.438
Okay, let's go ahead
and get him up on the gurney.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.307
1, 2, 3.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.176
Okay, let's get a set
of vitals before we move.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.945
What are you showing, Kevin?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.447
He's asystole.
You want to call it?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.516
Yeah, I got no pulse.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.351
I got brain matter.
Let's call it.

02:31.384 --> 02:34.154
9:25.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.476
â™ª (theme)

04:11.317 --> 04:12.519
You okay?

04:12.553 --> 04:15.522
Yep.

04:15.556 --> 04:19.291
Maybe you should take
a second chair.

04:19.325 --> 04:20.761
Ellenor, go with her.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.763
I think I should check on Helen.
She's--

04:22.796 --> 04:24.297
Lindsay can check
on Helen.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.299
Well, let Eugene do it.

04:26.332 --> 04:27.534
I didn't ask Eugene.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.835
Well, I'm asking you
to ask him.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.837
-Ellenor.
-Why can't Eugene do it?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.438
-It's a murder trial, Ellenor.
-All right, come on.

04:32.472 --> 04:33.640
Eugene can't
do murder trials?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.041
-No, not this one, no.
-Why not?

04:35.075 --> 04:37.310
-Because I'm asking you!
-Bobby?

04:37.343 --> 04:39.813
Why can't you just do it?
Why do I have to fight?

04:44.417 --> 04:46.452
I can second chair.
I'm free.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.524
Let's go.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.859
I guess
I'll be going now.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.104
We've cleared the area.
Last cell on the left.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.739
Good.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.908
Beat it.

05:19.620 --> 05:23.389
Don't even bother.
I'm represented by counsel.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.826
Mr. Donnell informs me
he no longer represents you.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.562
Then get me somebody else.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.730
I didn't hear that.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.465
Here's the deal,
Mr. Cahill--

05:32.498 --> 05:34.601
You're going to tell me
who the shooters are.

05:36.469 --> 05:37.638
Oh, really?

05:37.671 --> 05:40.140
And what are you going
to offer me

05:40.173 --> 05:41.474
for this gesture?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.476
Your life.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.411
See, I have
a press conference

05:45.445 --> 05:47.814
scheduled for 11:00,
at which point

05:47.848 --> 05:49.950
I'm going to announce
that you have agreed

05:49.983 --> 05:52.118
to tell us not only
who the trigger man was,

05:52.152 --> 05:53.720
but also the names

05:53.754 --> 05:55.421
of the people
you do business with.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.924
Then I'm going
to have you released

05:57.958 --> 05:59.926
into the general
prison population,

05:59.960 --> 06:01.461
and you will be dead.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.129
Right.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.632
You want to call my bluff?

06:07.601 --> 06:08.969
You're a dead man.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.909
Hold on.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.478
You get me a lawyer first,

06:18.512 --> 06:21.414
and then I'll consider things.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.920
Manslaughter?

06:26.953 --> 06:29.189
If we can agree on sentencing.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.692
They must know I'm innocent.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.628
If they really thought
I killed her, like they say,

06:34.661 --> 06:37.698
they would never
offer manslaughter,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.566
would they?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.902
The offer doesn't reflect
what they believe, Wendall.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.771
It only goes to how they feel
about the case.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.173
Well, I want to reject it.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.643
If I plead guilty to any charge,

06:49.676 --> 06:52.979
people will think
I killed my wife.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.481
That's what they'll all think.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.818
I am not saying
take the offer.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.221
But you would be risking
a life sentence

07:01.254 --> 07:04.490
by going to trial.
You understand that?

07:04.525 --> 07:07.694
I want to go to trial.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.669
You did everything
you could, Bobby.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.504
You warned him.
Richard had protection.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.072
There was nothing
that was--

07:19.105 --> 07:22.709
I'm going to give you
some of my cases, okay, Eugene?

07:22.743 --> 07:26.513
I'm going to take
some time off, I think.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.082
How long?

07:29.115 --> 07:32.686
Maybe indefinite.

07:32.719 --> 07:35.656
I don't think that would be
wise at the moment.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.991
Everybody's trying
to hold it together.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.693
We need your leadership.

07:39.726 --> 07:40.994
You took over before.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.663
You did a great job.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.932
There are times

07:45.966 --> 07:48.769
when the people here
need you.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.707
This is
one of those times.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.979
I need time to process this,
Ms. Gamble. I can't just--

07:59.012 --> 08:00.847
You don't have
the time, Mr. Powell.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.749
Whoever shot Richard Bay
might be

08:02.783 --> 08:04.885
fleeing the jurisdiction
as we speak or planning to.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.620
Offer's good
for one hour only.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.888
If there's a deal,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.990
I want it on paper
with a judge on board.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.692
No time.
You've got one hour.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.126
This is extortion.
You threatened

08:13.159 --> 08:14.995
to hang a snitch jacket
on my client.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.697
That's a death threat.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.632
Mr. Powell, if you're
turning down the deal,

08:18.665 --> 08:19.866
then get out.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.603
Run it by me again.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.739
First, he gets immunity
on Richard Bay's murder.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.741
Which we make no admission
he had anything to do with.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.776
Right. He just happens
to know who did.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.712
And what about
his life sentence?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.013
We'll cut it
to 20 years.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.780
And how would you
accomplish that

08:34.815 --> 08:36.582
when the sentence
is statutory?

08:36.616 --> 08:37.851
You bring a motion
to vacate the verdict,

08:37.884 --> 08:39.152
and I support it.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.921
And you think a judge
would ever sign off--

08:40.953 --> 08:42.789
If he knows
the deal was made

08:42.823 --> 08:45.726
to capture the killer
of a district attorney, yes.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.762
You then enter a plea
to two counts of second degree,

08:48.795 --> 08:51.031
we run the sentences
concurrently,

08:51.064 --> 08:53.767
he's eligible for parole
in 20 years.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.169
I'll certainly
take it to him.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.171
Take it to him now,
and tell him

08:58.204 --> 09:01.074
that the general prison
population awaits him.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.610
I'll draft
the plea agreement

09:03.644 --> 09:05.846
and see you in an hour.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.750
When I got to the house,

09:09.783 --> 09:12.052
she was lying face-up
next to the pool.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.820
Mrs. Forsley?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.789
Yes. I immediately checked
for vital signs,

09:15.822 --> 09:17.023
but she was dead.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.759
Was anybody else there?

09:18.792 --> 09:20.761
Mr. Forsley.
He was soaking wet.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.096
Did Mr. Forsley
say anything to you?

09:23.129 --> 09:26.199
Yes, he stated that he'd
just arrived home from work.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.670
He discovered his wife lying
at the bottom of the pool.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.072
He jumped in,
pulled her out,

09:32.105 --> 09:35.041
tried to revive her,
but was unsuccessful.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.910
Officer, at what time
did you arrive

09:36.943 --> 09:38.779
at the Forsley residence
that night?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.681
It was at 9:52 P. M.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.782
And, Officer,

09:41.815 --> 09:44.918
when did the 911 call
come in, to your knowledge?

09:44.951 --> 09:46.687
At 9:41.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.755
WOMAN:
I was walking my dog

09:48.789 --> 09:49.956
when I saw him
arrive home.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.191
Saw who, Ms. Mosher?

09:51.224 --> 09:54.961
Wendall. He pulled
into his driveway.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.697
Do you know
the defendant?

09:56.730 --> 09:57.898
Yes, he's
my next-door neighbor.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.065
And you saw him
in the car?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.801
I saw him in the car,

10:00.834 --> 10:03.069
I saw him get out
and walk in the front door.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.906
Are you positive
that it was Wendall Forsley?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.140
I'm positive, yes.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.910
I was on the other side
of the street.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.277
And what time was this?

10:11.311 --> 10:12.946
A little before 8:00.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.280
I was impatiently waiting

10:14.314 --> 10:16.717
for my dog
to have his bowel movement.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.785
It was about 3 minutes
to 8:00,

10:18.819 --> 10:20.787
because I wanted
to get back inside

10:20.821 --> 10:24.257
to see "Boston Public,"
which starts at 8:00.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.292
You testified
that you know Wendall.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.961
Yes. We're neighbors.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.830
How well do you know him?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.798
Well, we've lived
next to each other

10:31.832 --> 10:33.033
for three years.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.736
-Been to each other's houses?
-Many times.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.137
How would you describe him?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.840
Gentle, kind.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.275
In the three years
you've been living next to him,

10:42.308 --> 10:44.978
did you ever hear Wendall
and his wife argue?

10:45.011 --> 10:47.914
-Never.
-Ever see, hear, or witness

10:47.948 --> 10:50.216
Wendall become violent
in any way?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.786
No.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.187
Ever see him
with his wife Annie?

10:54.220 --> 10:56.156
Oh, many times.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.991
Could you describe
that relationship

10:58.024 --> 10:59.059
as you observed it?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.861
It seemed very loving.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.964
They were both
very devoted to each other.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.770
You don't think it was worth
crossing her on the time?

11:09.803 --> 11:11.137
She was too positive.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.039
Three minutes and counting
to "Boston Public,"

11:13.073 --> 11:14.775
waiting for her dog
to poop.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.076
Did you check to see

11:16.109 --> 11:17.944
if they maybe ran
that show late that night?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.245
I checked. They didn't,

11:19.279 --> 11:21.047
and we're not disputing
the time anyway.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.017
But he told the cop
he had just gotten home.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.185
He was in shock.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.721
He admits
he was wrong about that.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.723
That's kind of a big mistake.

11:29.756 --> 11:32.025
Jimmy, he's innocent.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.193
That mistake

11:33.226 --> 11:36.229
is the only reason
he's on trial.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.871
All of this is conditional.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.340
The shooter only--
No business associates.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.209
Everybody involved
in the shooting,

11:49.242 --> 11:51.812
directly, indirectly,
or there is no deal.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.814
There's just one guy.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.949
A witness saw
a woman driver in the car.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.283
Yeah, that was his mother.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.184
She lives with him.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.821
Hold on. This says 30 years.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.823
-You said he'd be out in 20.
-Amend it.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.826
If it turns out anybody else
is involved, deal is off.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.062
-There's nobody else.
-What's his name?

12:09.095 --> 12:10.296
Initial that.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.200
Name and address.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.840
Bruce Manning.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.042
He lives
at 1412 Columbus Street

12:22.075 --> 12:23.276
in the South End.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.096
How you doing?

12:43.129 --> 12:44.130
Okay.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.803
Ellenor doesn't think so.

12:53.239 --> 12:56.376
Why are you even working?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.211
I have things to do.

12:59.913 --> 13:00.947
You're giving the eulogy?

13:00.981 --> 13:03.249
One of them.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.487
Seems like yesterday

13:07.521 --> 13:10.290
we were kids in school,
doesn't it?

13:10.323 --> 13:15.295
Talking about our dreams.

13:15.328 --> 13:19.299
Now you're married,
a mom.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.334
We've had friends killed.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.840
We're not kids anymore,
are we?

13:26.873 --> 13:29.409
No.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.580
(whispers) No.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.386
Did you make
a determination, Doctor,

13:40.420 --> 13:41.855
as to the cause of death?

13:41.888 --> 13:43.957
Asphyxiation
caused by drowning.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.860
What led you to make
this finding, Doctor?

13:46.893 --> 13:49.462
The amount of water
we found in her lungs.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.397
And did you make
a determination

13:51.431 --> 13:54.568
as to whether this drowning
was accidental or not?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.937
There was bruising
around the victim's neck

13:56.970 --> 13:59.339
consistent with her
being held under water.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.042
We ruled it a homicide.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.476
Cause of death
was drowning?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.477
Correct.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.179
And, Doctor,

14:06.212 --> 14:08.414
you mentioned bruises
around Mrs. Forsley's neck.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.584
Were there any other bruises
found on her?

14:10.617 --> 14:13.353
There was a slight contusion
on the side of her head.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.955
Any idea
how she got that?

14:14.988 --> 14:16.557
The head may have
scraped the pool

14:16.590 --> 14:18.058
when he was
pulling her out.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.425
Could it be possible

14:19.459 --> 14:21.394
she hit her head
before drowning?

14:21.427 --> 14:23.363
I don't think that happened.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.499
-Is it possible?
-It's possible.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.934
Thank you, Doctor.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.436
And is it possible Mrs. Forsley
bumped her head,

14:30.470 --> 14:33.373
became unconscious,
causing her to drown?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.308
With bruises
around her neck?

14:35.341 --> 14:37.377
If one were to drag her
from a pool by her neck,

14:37.410 --> 14:39.379
she could get postmortem
bruising, could she not?

14:39.412 --> 14:41.582
Is that
what he's saying?

14:41.615 --> 14:44.518
This isn't about what
anybody's saying, Doctor.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.120
I'm asking you,
as a coroner,

14:47.153 --> 14:50.624
if a drowning victim were
pulled from a pool by her neck,

14:50.657 --> 14:53.393
could she suffer
postmortem bruising?

14:53.426 --> 14:55.662
I'll say unlikely.

14:55.696 --> 14:56.663
Unlikely.

14:56.697 --> 14:58.198
So possible.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.167
Remotely possible.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.406
Captain.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.309
Ms. Gamble,
nice to see you again.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.311
I'm sorry about Mr. Bay.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.113
Thank you.
Listen, I've made

15:13.146 --> 15:14.347
a tentative deal
with Jackie Cahill.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.116
He's given me the name
of the shooter.

15:16.149 --> 15:19.185
Here's the address.
Now, the problem is,

15:19.219 --> 15:20.687
there are others
in the building,

15:20.721 --> 15:22.656
including his mother.
According to Mr. Cahill,

15:22.689 --> 15:25.058
this man won't hesitate
to either take hostages

15:25.091 --> 15:27.493
or shoot his way out.
My suggestion--

15:27.528 --> 15:30.363
You apprehend him outside.
He has a nighttime job.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.633
Reportedly, he leaves
for work around 9:00.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.334
This comes from Cahill?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.236
Yes. Evidently, he carries
at all times.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.572
He's extremely dangerous,
as he is volatile,

15:38.605 --> 15:41.141
so make sure your men
protect themselves.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.577
We'll take him tonight.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.612
Thank you.

15:48.481 --> 15:53.453
I went out to the pool
and I saw her.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.590
She was just laying
face-down on the bottom.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.659
And what did you do?

15:58.692 --> 16:00.527
I jumped in to get her.

16:00.561 --> 16:03.196
I swam down,
I pulled her out,

16:03.229 --> 16:06.332
I tried to give her
mouth-to-mouth, but...

16:06.366 --> 16:09.202
When you pulled her out,
how did you do that?

16:09.235 --> 16:10.270
I first tried to

16:10.303 --> 16:12.472
by the arm,

16:12.506 --> 16:15.175
but I couldn't
get any leverage.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.477
I remember
I grabbed her head

16:17.511 --> 16:19.479
to pull her upright
a little,

16:19.513 --> 16:22.415
then tried to get her
on my shoulder.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.185
Did you ever grab
her neck?

16:25.218 --> 16:29.255
I may have.
I can't really remember.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.491
How long did it take for you
to pull her out?

16:31.525 --> 16:34.260
Well, I was unsuccessful
at first.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.196
I had to come up for air.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.497
Then I went back down,

16:37.531 --> 16:39.633
and I was able
to drag her up.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.235
It might have been
a few minutes.

16:42.268 --> 16:46.406
Do you remember what happened
as you pulled her out?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.408
I remember trying
to revive her,

16:48.441 --> 16:51.545
and when I couldn't,
I called 911.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.650
WENDALL: My wife
isn't breathing.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.219
WOMAN: Sir, can you
tell me your address?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.421
She isn't breathing!
She was in the pool!

17:01.454 --> 17:03.056
WOMAN:
Where is she now, sir?

17:03.089 --> 17:04.390
WENDALL: She's on the ground!
I got her out,

17:04.424 --> 17:07.292
but she's not breathing!
Oh, she's blue! My God!

17:12.365 --> 17:14.734
Is that your voice,
Mr. Forsley?

17:14.768 --> 17:15.769
Yes.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.804
Okay.

17:17.838 --> 17:20.140
When did you arrive home
from work that evening?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.342
It was probably
somewhere around 8:00.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.478
And when did you discover
your wife in the pool?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.781
Closer to 9:30.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.817
So you had been home
for more than an hour.

17:30.851 --> 17:31.818
Yes.

17:31.852 --> 17:33.453
What were you doing

17:33.486 --> 17:35.488
between the time
you arrived home

17:35.522 --> 17:37.691
and the time
you discovered your wife?

17:37.724 --> 17:40.627
I was in my den
doing bills.

17:40.661 --> 17:42.796
So why did you tell
the police

17:42.829 --> 17:46.366
you had just gotten home
before you discovered your wife?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.702
I don't know.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.505
I must have been
in shock.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.339
You stuck by
your time story

17:53.373 --> 17:55.709
at an interrogation later
at the police station.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.277
Were you in shock then?

17:57.310 --> 17:58.645
Probably.

17:58.679 --> 18:01.347
And when you then found out
that you had been seen

18:01.381 --> 18:03.283
by Ms. Mosher
arriving home at 8:00,

18:03.316 --> 18:05.318
I bet you that gave you
a little shock.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.387
-Objection.
-Sustained.

18:07.420 --> 18:11.658
Was your wife a good swimmer,
Mr. Forsley?

18:11.692 --> 18:13.660
Yes.

18:13.694 --> 18:15.328
In fact, she was
a competitive swimmer

18:15.361 --> 18:16.496
in college, was she not?

18:16.530 --> 18:17.397
She was.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.833
I noticed that your pool
is about 20 yards

18:19.866 --> 18:21.868
behind the back door
of your house.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.870
Can you see
the bottom of the pool

18:23.904 --> 18:25.338
from the back door?

18:25.371 --> 18:26.607
No.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.308
You had to walk up
to look, right?

18:28.341 --> 18:29.375
Right.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.411
So you opened the door,

18:31.444 --> 18:32.746
you saw that she was
not out there,

18:32.779 --> 18:34.515
and you said
to yourself,

18:34.548 --> 18:37.417
"Gee, I think I'll check
the bottom of the pool"?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.620
-Objection.
-Overruled.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.755
What made you think
she might be at the bottom?

18:41.788 --> 18:44.758
She didn't answer, so--

18:44.791 --> 18:46.893
You said you went
from your office

18:46.927 --> 18:48.862
to the kitchen
to the pool.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.631
Rather than first seeing

18:50.664 --> 18:52.833
if she was upstairs
in her bedroom,

18:52.866 --> 18:55.836
rather than see if she's
out in her art studio,

18:55.869 --> 18:57.437
you said to yourself,

18:57.470 --> 18:59.773
"Let me check
the bottom of the pool"?

18:59.806 --> 19:03.409
I don't know why.

19:03.443 --> 19:07.681
Maybe I just had a feeling.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.338
What are you doing here?

19:32.372 --> 19:33.807
I just wanted to monitor,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.809
make sure no fourth amendment
rights are violated here.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.443
How did you get past
our checkpoints?

19:37.477 --> 19:39.412
I'm a district attorney.

19:39.445 --> 19:41.481
This could be
a dangerous area, Ms. Gamble.

19:41.515 --> 19:43.750
You said so yourself.
If he comes out shooting--

19:43.784 --> 19:45.552
I'll duck down.

19:45.586 --> 19:48.188
Keep your distance.

20:11.612 --> 20:12.579
-Bruce Manning!
-Freeze!

20:12.613 --> 20:13.914
-Hold it!
-Get down!

20:14.981 --> 20:16.282
Gun!

20:39.039 --> 20:41.742
What's happening?
Bruce?

20:41.775 --> 20:44.578
Bruce?
What have you done?

20:46.046 --> 20:49.750
Place this woman
under arrest for felony murder

20:49.783 --> 20:51.752
and take her into custody.

20:51.785 --> 20:54.254
(woman sobbing)

20:55.922 --> 20:58.925
Bruce!

21:11.638 --> 21:13.507
Just now?

21:13.540 --> 21:14.608
About an hour ago.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.010
Why were you there?

21:17.043 --> 21:19.045
There was nothing
on television, okay, Ellenor?

21:19.079 --> 21:20.514
It was either a movie
or watch a guy get shot.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.415
Is that funny?

21:24.017 --> 21:26.386
You enjoy it, Helen?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.488
It didn't hurt.

21:28.522 --> 21:29.956
(doorbell rings)

21:35.028 --> 21:36.763
Mike?

21:36.797 --> 21:38.799
Why didn't you tell me
this was going down?

21:40.801 --> 21:42.936
The man didn't have a weapon.
Do you know that, Helen?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.505
It was a cell phone.

21:44.538 --> 21:46.507
It was dark.
He made a quick move.

21:46.540 --> 21:49.075
From my vantage point,
the shooting looked justified.

21:49.109 --> 21:51.545
Well, from mine,
it looked like an execution.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.780
You tell the police
he'll take hostages,

21:53.814 --> 21:55.816
you got to take him outside,
he'll be armed,

21:55.849 --> 21:58.519
he's volatile, he'll shoot,
protect yourselves--

21:58.552 --> 22:01.487
Is there any other way this
could have gone down, Helen?

22:01.522 --> 22:03.489
This was the equivalent
of a hit.

22:03.524 --> 22:05.792
I have to take a different
legal point of view there,

22:05.826 --> 22:06.960
Mike, but you know what?

22:06.993 --> 22:08.695
If it gets out
on the street,

22:08.729 --> 22:10.597
whack a D. A.
and this is what happens,

22:10.631 --> 22:11.932
I can live with that.

22:11.965 --> 22:13.734
There's going to be
an investigation.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.803
Tell me where and when.
I'll show up wearing white.

22:16.837 --> 22:20.340
What's this deal
you made with Cahill?

22:23.043 --> 22:25.411
Tomorrow
we put our doctors in.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.414
Dr. Winters will testify
that she could have drowned,

22:28.448 --> 22:30.116
that the bruising
is consistent with you

22:30.150 --> 22:32.118
pulling her
out of the pool by the neck.

22:32.152 --> 22:35.055
Dr. Marks will testify that
you appeared to be in shock.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.423
They've offered no motive.
I think we're okay.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.992
Yeah.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.461
Bec, Mr. Bullock
is here.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.996
Now?

22:43.029 --> 22:46.099
He says it's important.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.804
Thanks.

22:52.773 --> 22:54.407
This is slightly
embarrassing.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.009
You caught
the real killer?

22:56.042 --> 22:58.011
You could say that,
Jimmy, yeah.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.780
What's going on?

22:59.813 --> 23:01.447
Well, it seems
your client has an alias.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.916
Why we're just
finding this out,

23:02.949 --> 23:04.685
I don't know,

23:04.718 --> 23:06.452
but this hoarseness
you hear in my voice

23:06.486 --> 23:08.589
is 'cause
I've been screaming.

23:08.622 --> 23:10.624
-He has an alias?
-Peter Bryant.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.859
He was arrested
six years ago in Indiana

23:12.893 --> 23:14.995
for murder,

23:15.028 --> 23:16.697
charged
with strangling his wife.

23:16.730 --> 23:17.964
He was acquitted.

23:17.998 --> 23:20.767
I guess at that point,
he moved to Boston

23:20.801 --> 23:23.136
to make a new life
for himself.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.640
When he was 14,

23:26.673 --> 23:28.642
he strangled
an 11-year-old girl

23:28.675 --> 23:30.143
and a 9-year-old girl.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.845
He was convicted

23:31.878 --> 23:35.782
and served time
till he was 21.

23:35.816 --> 23:38.552
He also used to
strangle chickens.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.886
Excuse me?

23:39.920 --> 23:42.789
As a youth,
he would trespass onto farms

23:42.823 --> 23:46.593
and kill chickens--
Hundreds of them.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.505
What's wrong?

23:58.539 --> 24:00.106
There's been a new development.

24:00.140 --> 24:01.141
What?

24:01.174 --> 24:04.244
The D. A. found out
about three other murders...

24:04.277 --> 24:05.912
Peter.

24:11.051 --> 24:12.919
I was acquitted.

24:12.953 --> 24:15.188
Of the last one,
not the first two.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.924
Those were juvie.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.826
Well, the D.A.
is gonna try

24:19.860 --> 24:21.595
to introduce them
as pattern evidence.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.530
There's a motion
scheduled tomorrow.

24:23.564 --> 24:24.965
We're going
to fight it, but...

24:30.203 --> 24:31.972
Is manslaughter
still on the table?

24:32.005 --> 24:33.674
No.

24:35.876 --> 24:38.478
Want to tell us
about the chickens?

24:50.757 --> 24:52.559
You killed him?

24:52.593 --> 24:55.061
Mr. Cahill, I'm afraid
I'm not satisfied

24:55.095 --> 24:56.763
that you turned over

24:56.797 --> 24:59.833
all the people responsible
for Mr. Bay's death.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.034
What?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.636
I did.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.539
Well, it's unfortunate
that I just don't trust you.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.875
Accordingly, the deal is off.
Your life sentence stands.

25:08.909 --> 25:10.777
-Hold on.
-Wait a minute.

25:10.811 --> 25:13.714
On what basis do you believe
there were others involved?

25:13.747 --> 25:14.915
My gut.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.017
Have a nice life,
Mr. Cahill.

25:17.050 --> 25:19.019
We have
a signed agreement.

25:19.052 --> 25:20.854
I don't believe
he lived up to the terms.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.556
We're going right to court.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.990
Excellent.
That'll sure put the word out

25:24.024 --> 25:26.893
that you turned
state's evidence.

25:26.927 --> 25:29.763
I guess
this is goodbye, Jackie.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.065
You don't think I can
hit you from inside?

25:32.098 --> 25:34.034
Jackie--

25:38.705 --> 25:42.909
I was so hoping
you'd say that.

25:46.847 --> 25:48.615
Prior bad acts
in a criminal case

25:48.649 --> 25:49.916
are inadmissible.

25:49.950 --> 25:51.752
Except when they go
to pattern, Your Honor.

25:51.785 --> 25:53.687
He was never convicted
of the crime.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.822
He was arrested for it,
and the two prior murders--

25:55.856 --> 25:57.891
Were juvenile offenses,
which means,

25:57.924 --> 26:00.026
as a matter of law,
they never happened.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.695
Juvie is sealed.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.765
That means we're talking
about one prior offense.

26:04.798 --> 26:06.933
One offense does not
amount to a pattern.

26:06.967 --> 26:08.635
The pattern is
he kills wives.

26:08.669 --> 26:10.604
Oh, come on.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.205
Look, this man borders
on being a serial killer.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.040
He is going to kill again.

26:14.074 --> 26:17.110
Based on what I'm hearing,
I'd say it's a guarantee,

26:17.143 --> 26:19.646
but juvenile records
are sealed.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.147
And as for the prior
bad acts,

26:21.181 --> 26:23.149
I'd be handing him an appeal
on a silver platter.

26:23.183 --> 26:24.918
It's not coming in.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.787
So we're just going
to pretend for the jury

26:26.820 --> 26:28.088
that none of this
ever happened?

26:28.121 --> 26:30.223
We're going
to finish the case,

26:30.256 --> 26:32.025
And then win or lose,

26:32.058 --> 26:33.126
you can go home,

26:33.159 --> 26:34.961
pour yourself a little Scotch,

26:34.995 --> 26:37.097
and lament the perversity
of the system.

26:46.139 --> 26:49.409
Bec, are you all right?

26:49.442 --> 26:51.144
Yeah.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.279
I just, um...

27:00.286 --> 27:01.955
With Richard getting killed...

27:04.725 --> 27:07.628
The reality of...

27:08.762 --> 27:11.364
The reality of what?

27:11.397 --> 27:14.735
I've been clinging
a little to this case.

27:14.768 --> 27:18.438
The idea that we fight

27:18.471 --> 27:21.141
for the innocent sometimes,
too, you know?

27:21.174 --> 27:23.243
And Wendall-- I just--

27:23.276 --> 27:27.013
I needed him
to be innocent, you know?

27:27.047 --> 27:30.016
Yeah.

27:30.050 --> 27:32.052
Jimmy...

27:34.087 --> 27:36.289
he's going to kill again.

27:36.322 --> 27:40.193
Well, that's not something
to mention in your closing.

27:40.226 --> 27:43.997
It's, uh, not even something
we should think about.

27:44.030 --> 27:47.333
It's not even something
we should think about.

27:47.367 --> 27:49.269
Rebecca--

27:49.302 --> 27:51.838
No, no, what the hell
are we doing?

27:51.872 --> 27:53.907
-Keep your voice--
-Is there even any doubt
that he'll kill again?

27:53.940 --> 27:55.375
Rebecca!

28:03.316 --> 28:05.318
This is classic
contract law, Your Honor.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.921
Ms. Gamble offered a deal,
we accepted the terms,

28:07.954 --> 28:09.289
she received
consideration--

28:09.322 --> 28:11.191
-First of all--
-I'm not finished.

28:11.224 --> 28:15.061
We also have to consider
substantive due process.

28:15.095 --> 28:16.897
The government
must be required

28:16.930 --> 28:18.098
to give Mr. Cahill

28:18.131 --> 28:19.866
the benefit
of what he bargained for.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.101
He gave over the shooter,

28:21.134 --> 28:23.103
who was shot dead,
by the way.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.405
For Ms. Gamble
to now say no deal,

28:25.438 --> 28:27.340
that is blatant
bad faith.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.943
This woman was a friend
of Richard Bay's.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.913
She's been on a mission.
The shooter is now dead.

28:32.946 --> 28:35.181
Now she's reneging
on a signed agreement

28:35.215 --> 28:37.317
to get my client,
and it should shock

28:37.350 --> 28:40.954
the conscience of this court's
fundamental notion of fairness.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.089
Ms. Gamble?

28:43.123 --> 28:45.358
The deal called
for Mr. Cahill

28:45.391 --> 28:48.995
to reveal everybody
involved in Mr. Bay's death.

28:49.029 --> 28:51.097
Because the shooter
was fatally wounded,

28:51.131 --> 28:53.099
our investigation
of Mr. Bay's murder

28:53.133 --> 28:54.901
has been
severely undermined.

28:54.935 --> 28:59.005
As for fundamental notions
of fairness,

28:59.039 --> 29:01.441
this man
put a hit on a D. A.

29:01.474 --> 29:04.144
He has since threatened
to put a hit on me.

29:04.177 --> 29:07.080
I find it unbelievable
that a man who has

29:07.113 --> 29:09.249
violated our laws
with such brutality,

29:09.282 --> 29:10.450
a man that has murdered

29:10.483 --> 29:12.418
and committed
acts of depravity,

29:12.452 --> 29:15.388
for him now to be seeking
the protection of the law,

29:15.421 --> 29:20.527
to be exalting arguments
of fairness and due process--

29:20.561 --> 29:24.264
This classic contract law
that Mr. Powell speaks of

29:24.297 --> 29:27.467
calls for the parties
to act with clean hands.

29:27.500 --> 29:31.137
I'd ask the court to consider
Mr. Cahill's hands.

29:31.171 --> 29:35.041
And I would ask the court
to consider Helen Gamble's.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.254
I'm sorry.

29:48.288 --> 29:51.191
Yeah.

29:51.224 --> 29:55.295
I know how close
you two were, and...

29:55.328 --> 29:59.199
I'm sorry
for your loss,

29:59.232 --> 30:02.002
and I'm sorry
for being an accomplice

30:02.035 --> 30:03.303
in his death.

30:03.336 --> 30:06.406
Bobby, you weren't
an accomplice.

30:06.439 --> 30:09.142
There's no more
denying that, Helen.

30:09.175 --> 30:12.145
You're a defense attorney.

30:12.178 --> 30:15.315
Yeah.

30:15.348 --> 30:18.418
The magic words,
I guess,

30:18.451 --> 30:22.022
to check your conscience
at the door.

30:27.127 --> 30:31.331
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

30:31.364 --> 30:33.466
You okay?

30:35.368 --> 30:37.538
No.

30:45.045 --> 30:46.847
Oh.

30:53.386 --> 30:56.022
Every medical expert--

30:56.056 --> 30:59.392
Ours and theirs,
including the coroner,

30:59.425 --> 31:02.228
has admitted
that she drowned,

31:02.262 --> 31:05.231
that the bruising on the neck
could've been postmortem,

31:05.265 --> 31:07.668
that they could've been
inflicted

31:07.701 --> 31:11.237
by my client's attempts
to pull her out of the pool.

31:11.271 --> 31:15.008
There is no evidence
of any motive.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.578
There is no evidence
that Wendall Forsley

31:17.611 --> 31:20.581
was violent toward his wife
or any other person.

31:20.614 --> 31:23.283
There is no case here,

31:23.316 --> 31:25.251
ladies and gentlemen.

31:25.285 --> 31:28.288
Wendall Forsley
is only on trial

31:28.321 --> 31:31.324
because he seemingly lied

31:31.357 --> 31:34.961
about what time he got home
that night.

31:34.995 --> 31:37.163
But as he told you,

31:37.197 --> 31:40.466
as Dr. Winters told you,
he went into shock.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.937
He wasn't trying to hide
anything

31:43.970 --> 31:48.041
because Wendall Forsley
had nothing to hide.

31:57.984 --> 32:01.021
He told police
that he had just gotten home

32:01.054 --> 32:04.558
a full hour after he was seen
entering the house,

32:04.591 --> 32:06.192
and he repeated this lie

32:06.226 --> 32:09.029
during an interrogation
the next day.

32:09.062 --> 32:12.265
It was only when he was told
he had been seen

32:12.298 --> 32:14.701
going into that house at 8:00

32:14.735 --> 32:17.203
that he then changed his story

32:17.237 --> 32:21.141
and said, "I was in shock.
No sense of time."

32:21.174 --> 32:24.711
good swimmers just don't turn up
at the bottom of the pool

32:24.745 --> 32:28.148
with such marks
around their neck.

32:28.181 --> 32:29.983
She was murdered.

32:30.016 --> 32:34.955
She was murdered
by Wendall Forsley.

32:40.060 --> 32:41.327
WOMAN: All rise.

32:43.630 --> 32:46.633
Be seated.

32:50.704 --> 32:52.539
I have reviewed the contract

32:52.573 --> 32:55.175
entered into by Ms. Gamble
and Mr. Cahill.

32:55.208 --> 32:59.212
I think Ms. Gamble's promises
were against public policy,

32:59.245 --> 33:01.014
lived up to or not.

33:01.047 --> 33:05.218
I also believe they could be
technically unenforceable

33:05.251 --> 33:08.689
under Massachusetts general law,
chapter 265, section one,

33:08.722 --> 33:11.224
which states that only the jury

33:11.257 --> 33:14.460
shall determine
the degree of murder.

33:14.494 --> 33:17.598
However,
the fact of the matter is

33:17.631 --> 33:21.535
we enforce plea agreements
like this every day,

33:21.568 --> 33:25.471
and Ms. Gamble's deceit,
trickery, bad faith--

33:25.506 --> 33:27.808
It's also against public policy.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.776
Lawyers who appear in my court

33:29.810 --> 33:33.547
do not get to take advantage
of technicalities and bad faith

33:33.580 --> 33:37.684
to get out of deals
they regret.

33:37.718 --> 33:40.521
I'm, therefore, honoring
the plea agreement.

33:40.554 --> 33:42.723
Mr. Cahill's
first degree convictions

33:42.756 --> 33:45.091
are set aside.

33:45.125 --> 33:48.161
We enter second degree counts,
and pursuant to the agreement,

33:48.194 --> 33:52.132
Mr. Cahill shall be eligible
for parole in 20 years.

33:54.568 --> 33:56.236
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:56.269 --> 34:00.807
However, this plea agreement
is silent on sentencing

34:00.841 --> 34:03.176
when it comes to other crimes,

34:03.209 --> 34:06.847
such as Mr. Cahill's threat
to hit Ms. Gamble.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.282
We deny
that ever happened.

34:09.315 --> 34:12.284
Yes, it would be nice for you
if you got a trial on that,

34:12.318 --> 34:14.286
but you don't.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.322
For sentencing purposes,
I need only find

34:16.356 --> 34:19.324
by a preponderance of
the evidence that it happened.

34:19.359 --> 34:23.163
I make that finding now.

34:23.196 --> 34:28.434
To threaten a D. A.,
Mr. Cahill,

34:28.467 --> 34:32.806
I'm adding 75 years
to each of your 2 counts,

34:32.839 --> 34:35.175
sentencing to run consecutively.

34:35.208 --> 34:38.178
So you will now be eligible
for parole

34:38.210 --> 34:39.813
in 150 years.

34:39.846 --> 34:41.313
Adjourned.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.315
(bangs gavel)

35:01.267 --> 35:03.770
You think you honored
Richard Bay in all this?

35:03.804 --> 35:06.507
Do you think that cowboy
up there just ratified you?

35:06.540 --> 35:07.608
Go away.

35:07.641 --> 35:09.142
Richard Bay was a man
of integrity.

35:09.175 --> 35:11.745
He honored his word.
He honored the law.

35:11.778 --> 35:14.581
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go to a funeral.

35:14.615 --> 35:16.817
Well, I hope you pay tribute
to him there,

35:16.850 --> 35:19.520
because neither you
nor that judge did here.

35:28.962 --> 35:32.866
I get the feeling...

35:32.899 --> 35:35.602
you don't really want me
to win.

35:37.704 --> 35:39.906
What was your motive?

35:39.940 --> 35:43.443
If you don't mind
my asking.

35:43.476 --> 35:45.478
I don't know.

35:48.815 --> 35:50.450
Maybe power.

35:50.483 --> 35:52.385
Power?

35:52.418 --> 35:54.655
Just like the chickens.

35:56.790 --> 35:59.893
I'd be holding this...

35:59.926 --> 36:02.596
little life in my hands,

36:02.629 --> 36:07.467
fully alive, vital...

36:07.500 --> 36:09.469
noisy.

36:09.503 --> 36:12.438
And with one squeeze...

36:22.716 --> 36:26.452
I didn't know
I was going to kill Annie.

36:31.457 --> 36:34.427
We were kissing...

36:34.460 --> 36:37.531
and I was caressing
her face.

36:39.966 --> 36:42.869
And she just seemed so...

36:45.672 --> 36:46.973
alive.

36:51.745 --> 36:55.481
The next thing...

36:58.752 --> 37:00.854
(knock on door)

37:00.887 --> 37:03.557
Jury's back.

37:11.998 --> 37:14.701
Will the defendant please rise?

37:17.571 --> 37:18.872
Madame foreperson,

37:18.905 --> 37:20.340
has the jury reached a verdict?

37:20.373 --> 37:23.877
-We have, Your Honor.
-What say you?

37:23.910 --> 37:27.681
Commonwealth
v. Wendall Forsley,

37:27.714 --> 37:30.517
on the charge
of murder in the first degree,

37:30.551 --> 37:34.387
we find the defendant
Wendall Forsley not guilty.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.791
On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

37:37.824 --> 37:40.661
we find the defendant
Wendall Forsley

37:40.694 --> 37:42.362
not guilty.

37:42.395 --> 37:44.765
The defendant is free to go.

37:44.798 --> 37:46.900
Members of the jury,

37:46.933 --> 37:49.836
you are dismissed
with the court's thanks.

37:49.870 --> 37:52.906
Thank you so much.

37:52.939 --> 37:55.942
I owe you my life.

37:57.410 --> 38:00.647
You need help, Wendall.

38:00.681 --> 38:04.585
I'd go to a therapist.
I really would.

38:04.618 --> 38:07.521
The thing is, if they think
I'd do it again,

38:07.554 --> 38:09.823
they might tell someone
and get me locked up.

38:12.626 --> 38:15.529
I can control myself.

38:15.562 --> 38:16.663
I really think I can.

38:21.602 --> 38:23.904
Well, thank you again.

38:26.507 --> 38:27.774
Good-bye.

38:55.536 --> 38:58.471
Richard had the choice
of stepping down

38:58.505 --> 39:01.107
from a case where the defendant
was threatening his life.

39:01.141 --> 39:04.110
He said to me,
"How can I do that?

39:04.144 --> 39:08.381
I'm a district attorney.
This is who I am,"

39:08.414 --> 39:12.385
and that's how he'd want
to be remembered.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.555
He was a public servant.

39:14.588 --> 39:19.593
He leaves a legacy
of truth,

39:19.626 --> 39:24.698
justice, and integrity
behind him,

39:24.731 --> 39:27.433
a legacy I've done
a lousy job

39:27.467 --> 39:30.036
living up to
the last few days...

39:32.038 --> 39:34.575
a legacy which has become
increasingly difficult

39:34.608 --> 39:37.043
for everyone
in the criminal justice system

39:37.077 --> 39:39.012
to live up to as of late.

39:39.045 --> 39:42.015
But for Richard it was easy,

39:42.048 --> 39:45.519
because his compass
always reminded him...

39:47.120 --> 39:51.157
he was a public servant.

39:51.191 --> 39:56.062
A lot of people he considered
his friends disliked him.

39:58.464 --> 40:01.034
A lot of them happen to be
my best friends--

40:01.067 --> 40:03.103
Defense attorneys,

40:03.136 --> 40:07.173
people who come to work
day after day

40:07.207 --> 40:09.510
fighting for the civil rights

40:09.543 --> 40:15.115
of those who have murdered,
raped, stole--

40:15.148 --> 40:19.052
People who knew that
by fighting for the guilty,

40:19.085 --> 40:22.623
they were ultimately
protecting the innocent.

40:22.656 --> 40:25.125
Those people have come
to doubt themselves

40:25.158 --> 40:28.695
in the wake
of Richard's death.

40:28.729 --> 40:30.797
Richard never doubted you.

40:32.232 --> 40:35.201
He respected you enormously

40:35.235 --> 40:39.005
because he knew you, too,
were public servants,

40:39.039 --> 40:42.676
and he'd want you
to know that.

40:42.709 --> 40:47.180
He was scared the night
before he was killed.

40:49.049 --> 40:52.485
He was afraid
that the threat made against him

40:52.519 --> 40:54.054
might be carried out.

40:56.690 --> 41:00.093
And he said if he should die,

41:00.126 --> 41:05.699
be sure to tell everyone
he tried his very best.

41:08.702 --> 41:10.837
We all know that, Richard.

41:16.577 --> 41:19.546
Lying there is a kind man,

41:19.580 --> 41:25.018
a man who saw a crime
and tried to stop it,

41:25.051 --> 41:30.824
a man who saw victims
and tried to console them,

41:30.857 --> 41:32.726
a man who...

41:36.630 --> 41:40.834
a man who,
more than anything else,

41:40.867 --> 41:45.138
was a dedicated public servant.

41:45.171 --> 41:51.144
â™ª There's a day of hope â™ª

41:51.177 --> 41:56.282
â™ª May I live to see â™ª

41:56.316 --> 42:01.688
â™ª When our hearts are happy â™ª

42:01.722 --> 42:06.226
â™ª And our souls are free â™ª

42:06.259 --> 42:12.123
â™ª Let the new day dawn â™ª

42:12.733 --> 42:17.871
â™ª Oh, Lord, I pray â™ª

42:17.904 --> 42:23.176
â™ª We'll never get to heaven â™ª

42:23.209 --> 42:28.715
â™ª Till we reach that day â™ª

42:28.749 --> 42:33.887
â™ª It's a day of peace â™ª

42:33.920 --> 42:39.259
â™ª A day of pride â™ª

42:39.292 --> 42:44.598
â™ª A day of justice â™ª

42:44.631 --> 42:49.770
â™ª We have been denied â™ª

42:49.803 --> 42:55.141
â™ª When a man can live â™ª

42:55.175 --> 43:00.280
â™ª And a child can play â™ª

43:00.313 --> 43:06.286
â™ª We'll never get to heaven â™ª

43:06.319 --> 43:11.291
â™ª Till we reach that day â™ª

43:11.324 --> 43:16.763
â™ª It's a day of peace â™ª

43:16.797 --> 43:21.668
â™ª A day of pride â™ª

43:21.702 --> 43:27.240
â™ª A day of justice â™ª

43:27.273 --> 43:30.644
â™ª We have been denied â™ª

43:30.677 --> 43:32.378
â™ª We've been denied â™ª

43:32.412 --> 43:37.851
â™ª When a man can live â™ª

43:37.884 --> 43:43.256
â™ª And a child can play â™ª

43:43.289 --> 43:48.394
â™ª We'll never get to heaven â™ª

43:48.428 --> 43:53.667
â™ª Till we reach that day â™ª

43:59.239 --> 44:01.274
â™ª (theme)

44:25.431 --> 44:26.767
You stinker!
