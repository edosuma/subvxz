- Man: You better share!
- Woman: Come on, baby, take it off.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.523
Just buy enough
to keep the girls happy.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.842

Take that back to the bar,
and when you're done,

flip the bottles at 72, 68, and 64.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.047
- They all need to order another round.
- I think they're slowing down.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.201
Then get them up and out, Holly.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.011
We got people outside
who want to give us their money. Go.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.962
Oh, my God, I had so much fun.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.566
I know, me, too, girl.
Thanks for coming.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.085
- All right, babe. Call me later.
- All right.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.287
Okay.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.841
- Get home safely, Lakeisha.
- Hi. Thank you.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.843
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.968
You good?
Entertaining our guests?

13:29.160 --> 13:32.289
It's late, baby.
Why don't we go home?

13:32.440 --> 13:35.489
You know, we could do a little
celebrating of our own.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.007
You take the car.
Send Shawn back for me.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.321
- Alex.
- Alex: Yup?

13:39.480 --> 13:42.211
Can you please
escort my wife to the door?

13:42.360 --> 13:45.011
Night, T.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.002
I'm sticking around.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.684
Going home now,
Mrs. St. Patrick?

14:01.840 --> 14:03.683
Where else would I go?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.923
( Dance music playing,
indistinct chattering )

14:26.840 --> 14:28.524
See that, Pop?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.684
I did it.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.725
Your boy did it.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.405
I've been looking all over for you.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.046
Everyone got clear.
No problems. Nobody tried shit.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.770
All the hustling, all the work.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.322
From working the corner
for Breeze and Kanan.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.245
It brought us here.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.368
You know, for two knuckleheads
that grew up like us, Tommy,

14:50.520 --> 14:53.763
to make it in the city, man,
ain't no small shit.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.446
We lost 200K tonight,
before we closed the store.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.490
Plus whatever we lost since.
We make up for that selling drinks?

14:59.640 --> 15:02.246
- The money ain't the real problem.
- Fuck that, it's not the real problem.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.449
No, the real problem is we need
to find out who the fuck is behind this.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.841
Miguel died tonight to protect them.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.042
We need answers.
Quick.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.565
Especially after we tell
Lobos we got hit.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.969
Shit, I say we don't tell him.
He ain't gotta know about this.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.248
- We pay him, get the fuck out of there.
- Nah.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.244
We gotta get out in front of it, man.
Only six months we're working for him.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.010
We got no history built.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.208
Lobos finds out about this,
and we ain't say shit?

15:25.400 --> 15:27.129
It's our ass anyway.
We got his product sitting

15:27.320 --> 15:30.688
in a goddamn shipping container
losing money by the minute.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.171
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.641
She probably
can't fucking sleep again.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.643
I'm just saying,
Lobos sets fire to people.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.087
That guy was
fucking his sister, man.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.607
We gotta give him his money.
Cash.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.001
Yeah, I got half,
but it's out at my mother's.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.286
I'll bring it tomorrow.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.727
Hey, I heard back from Drift.
That guy over in E.O.?

15:47.920 --> 15:50.491
He wants to get up with us next week.
Talk about buying from us.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.766
Nah, we gotta hold off on Jersey.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.649
Not till we find out
what the fuck's going on.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.290
Can't expand under fire.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.722
Hey, yo.
You got some fine-ass-looking girls

16:01.880 --> 16:03.644
serving drinks in there,
by the way.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.121
There was this one, red hair, tall.
What's her name?

16:06.280 --> 16:07.884
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.326
- Yeah.
- Her name is...

16:09.480 --> 16:11.528
Don't touch the merchandise,
motherfucker.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.842
Don't touch the...
( laughs )

16:14.000 --> 16:16.002
You ever gonna get over
that red-haired shit?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.645
Probably not.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.651
( Elevator dings, doors close )

17:33.480 --> 17:36.051
( alarm chirping )

17:41.200 --> 17:42.850
( phone beeps )

17:45.080 --> 17:47.082
When did you get home?

17:51.560 --> 17:53.244
Late.
( exhales )

17:56.560 --> 17:59.643
You know,
I could help you relax...

17:59.800 --> 18:00.801
if you let me.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.931
- ( Groans ) Oh, come on, Tash.
- Let me.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.651
( moaning )

18:45.640 --> 18:47.483
I can't. Please.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.961
Please, man. Please.

I'm not afraid to die.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.964
- Ghost: And I'm not afraid to kill you.
- ( gunshot )

19:05.480 --> 19:07.642
( Tasha sighs )

19:12.520 --> 19:15.000
- Come here.
- I gotta go.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.801
What?
Where you going?

19:18.960 --> 19:20.291
Oh, shit.

Raina, what are you doing?

19:32.320 --> 19:33.560
She's rehearsing, Mom.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.370
The auditions for
the Loew's school play in a month,

19:35.520 --> 19:36.681
and I want to be prepared.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.171
I'm talking about your outfit.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.522
It's not flattering
in your shape, baby.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.887
How about that nice dress
I bought you?

19:43.040 --> 19:45.850
Nobody wears dresses to school,
Big Mama.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.731
How's Daddy's little
girly boo-boo?

19:50.120 --> 19:52.043
- Morning, Estelle.
- Good morning.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.888
Estelle:
We're gonna have a tea party

19:56.040 --> 19:57.929
- and play with the castle.
- ( cell phone ringing )

19:58.080 --> 19:59.286
Come on.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.602
- Sit up here with Grandma.
-Lobos.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.364
( Speaking Spanish )

20:04.520 --> 20:08.002
- Estelle: You are getting heavy.
- So I got Spanish homework due Tuesday.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.243
- Think Dad could hook it up?
- No, you have to do your own work, boy.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.129
How does he know
Spanish anyway?

20:13.280 --> 20:16.363
Yeah, Tasha,
how does he know Spanish?

20:16.520 --> 20:19.126
I don't know.
He learned before we met.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.848
- Shawn: Morning, Mrs. St. Patrick.
- Hey, Shawn.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.002
Ah, Tariq, what's up, boy?

20:26.280 --> 20:28.886
When we gonna hoop, Shawn?
I've been begging you forever.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.570
Boy, leave him alone.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.449
Tariq, he's busy.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.490
Got a big job now.
You want some breakfast?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.369
There's more than enough
to go around. Go ahead.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.727
- Oh.
- Estelle: Come on, here.

20:39.920 --> 20:43.242
Here's your sippy. Here's your sippy.
Good girl.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.402
Shawn.
Let's get it.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.926
- Son.
- What's up, Dad?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.605
How's that history report?
You want me to read it later?

20:49.760 --> 20:51.444
- Sounds good.
- All right.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.846
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.206
- Good luck, okay?
- Okay.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.850
Daddy loves you.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.604
- Bye.
- Bye, baby.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.965
- Good.
- ( girl babbles )

21:01.120 --> 21:03.043
- Keep working on it, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.370
Tell your moms I said hello.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.204
She's getting worse, you know?

21:11.360 --> 21:13.601
I can't be out there all the time.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.764
- ( Cell phone vibrating )
-Lobos?

21:18.280 --> 21:20.521
Better not be changing
the fucking time again.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.205
By the way, I'm rethinking
this whole

21:22.360 --> 21:24.124
"tell Lobos we got hit"
idea of yours.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.565
It's Kantos.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.091
Let's see what he wants.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.411
What's up?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.011
You recognize the name
Simon Stern?

21:32.160 --> 21:33.571
Yeah.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.963
The cat that owns Parlay,
Verbatim, Syrup.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.122
Yeah, plus, like, five other clubs.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.170
He's one of the biggest
nightlife investors in New York.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.964
His office called.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.929
Stern told the Page Six
to write up about Truth.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.570
Wants to sit down.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.324
Ghost: I got a lot of shit on
my plate at the moment.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.801
Uh, we'll talk later.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.566
Kantos: It's a big deal.
He only talks to the major guys.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.165
Look, with Stern behind us,

21:56.320 --> 21:58.163
we can open up
clubs in Miami and Vegas

21:58.320 --> 22:00.084
end of next year.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.251
I'll call you back, man.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.970
Tommy:
What's his problem now?

22:07.120 --> 22:08.849
You know what?
Never mind.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.843
We got real shit to do.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.287
Ghost, Tommy.
Good to see you again.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.005
You have my money, of course?

22:27.000 --> 22:30.243
Uno, dos, tres,
cuatro, cinco, seis...

22:30.400 --> 22:32.004
- ( man grunts )
- ( speaking Spanish )

22:46.320 --> 22:48.721
Pedro.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.041
Órale.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.202
Now that the business
is out of the way,

22:52.360 --> 22:55.011
we can eat

22:55.160 --> 22:57.481
and enjoy ourselves, eh?

23:02.040 --> 23:03.963
How are things?

23:04.120 --> 23:05.485
Just fine.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.210
Something you need to know.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.765
Hmm?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.570
We got hit last night.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.722
So I heard.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.131
- Did you catch this man?
- We got him.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.691
He knew who to hit,
where and when.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.047
So until we know how he got
his information, we're exposed.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.407
- Oh, so he didn't talk?
- Unfortunately for him.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.608
Unfortunately for you.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.090
You took your men off the street.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.925
Had to.
No choice.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.765
You're losing
about $25,000 an hour.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.890
It's good to see
that you knew enough

23:38.040 --> 23:39.929
not to let it affect our pay schedule.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.607
When I hired you six months ago
to be my New York distributor,

23:46.760 --> 23:49.445
you guaranteed me a certain
level of professionalism.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.410
You told me that the Kings,
the Bloods, the DDP--

23:52.560 --> 23:55.484
that none of them
were worth my time.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.642
I believe the exact words were,

23:57.800 --> 24:01.441
"They're gangs
and we're a business."

24:01.600 --> 24:03.090
Hmm?

24:03.240 --> 24:06.369
You also told me
that only you could guarantee me

24:06.520 --> 24:08.682
a safe and secure pipeline

24:08.880 --> 24:11.281
- with no interruptions.
- Come on, Lobos.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.680
You know in this business,
there's no guarantees.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.444
We have a plan
to fix this situation.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.962
Then you don't have time for lunch.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.963
( Speaking Spanish )

24:39.000 --> 24:40.365
Si.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.651
Hmm?

25:27.560 --> 25:30.484
I'll go see Ruiz.
You get Anibal and Rolla, deal?

25:32.120 --> 25:35.090
- Yeah.
- See you tonight.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.720
- And watch your back.
- You, too, motherfucker.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.769
Full detail, right?
Even the trunk?

25:39.920 --> 25:41.490
- Especially the trunk.
- Good.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.444
I hate the smell of blood.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.048
( Music playing,
indistinct shouting in Spanish )

25:52.200 --> 25:54.680
No, he's a cheater.
You gotta watch him.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.721
He sends his regards.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.531
You play dominoes?

26:12.680 --> 26:15.081
It's not a social visit, Anibal.
We got hit last night.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.369
- My bad, I ain't hear that.
- Not a word?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.284
Nada.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.761
Yeah, well, a score like that
somebody will brag about.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.161
You hear something,

26:25.320 --> 26:28.085
50 stacks.
75 if you bring him to us alive.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.084
Means that much to you?

26:31.240 --> 26:32.969
If it's one of your men,
you can kill him yourself.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.885
- We just want to watch.
- Vato.

26:45.440 --> 26:49.411
( children laughing,
woman speaking Spanish )

26:49.560 --> 26:51.562
If I knew who ordered it,
yeah, they'd be dead already.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.404
( Speaking Spanish )

26:57.240 --> 26:58.765
My money guy, same as yours.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.809
They shot my boy, Angel.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.280
- He had a baby on the way.
- That's fucked up.

27:05.440 --> 27:09.081
Now, look, I know, okay,
you work with other crews.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.325
You have to stop this
before it goes any further.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.329
I could lend you men,
extra protection.

27:14.480 --> 27:15.766
Nah, if they know we ride together,

27:15.920 --> 27:18.127
I lose trust
of the Taínos and Rock Street.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.209
Tommy and I are neutral.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.805
Come on.

27:23.960 --> 27:27.328
Bueno. Maybe there's something
else that we could work out.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.323
( Car engine starts )

27:49.000 --> 27:51.002
It's the lead, Uncle Tommy.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.642
If I get it, it'll be, like, a huge deal
'cause I'm only in the fifth grade.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.690
I'm sure you got the best singing voice
in the whole place, Baby Girl.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.842
When are you
gonna stop calling me that?

28:00.000 --> 28:03.322
I'm not the baby anymore.
Yasmine is.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.005
I was there when you were born.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.009
You'll always be Baby Girl to me.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.690
Estelle:
To all of us.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.161
- Baby Girl.
- Tommy, have some more chicken.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.051
Mmm, oh. Mmm.
Thanks, T.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.725
You know,
if you meet a girl who can cook,

28:15.920 --> 28:17.888
I bet we'd never see you again.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.246
( Chuckles )
No way that'll ever happen.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.882
I gotta come over here
and school Tariq in Call of Duty.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.849
- Yeah, right, Uncle Tommy.
- Ghost: Yeah, right, 'cause you know

28:25.000 --> 28:26.764
you're not supposed to be
playing those games anyway.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.127
Oh, my bad.

28:29.280 --> 28:32.602
Stars for my little star.

28:32.760 --> 28:35.331
Keep working hard on that audition.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.090
Hey.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.242
Wait, Daddy,
are these real diamonds?

28:39.440 --> 28:41.283
( laughs )

28:41.440 --> 28:43.488
What you think, huh?

28:43.640 --> 28:46.962
If you keep this up,
you're gonna spoil her rotten.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.401
And you don't complain
when I do it to you.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.210
Fix me a plate, okay?

28:51.360 --> 28:54.204
Tommy and I are gonna talk
in the office. We got work to do.

29:02.080 --> 29:05.129
Let me see
them diamonds, Baby Girl.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.884
Ghost:
Soldado Nation got hit, too.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.771
- No shit.
- Ruiz got a full shipment of weapons

29:09.920 --> 29:11.410
from his Florida connect last week.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.489
Our drivers can have full use
till the shit blows over

29:13.640 --> 29:15.563
or until we catch the motherfucker.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.609
He offered to have
his people ride with ours.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.444
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.443
The guns, though, that could work.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.762
- I know you don't like it.
- Police stop a driver

29:23.920 --> 29:26.491
carrying recreational weight
and some cash, Tommy, that's one thing,

29:26.640 --> 29:28.847
but a gun in the car,
you're looking at intent to distribute,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.207
plus the weapons charge.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.125
- Kanan got what 15 years?
- You got a better idea?

29:34.280 --> 29:36.203
'Cause we gotta open up
the store or Lobos will move on.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.010
Not to mention
our people off the clock

29:38.160 --> 29:40.401
and our customers
finding new places to cop.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.800
Let's say we find the motherfucker

29:41.960 --> 29:44.804
and it is one of Anibal's people
or Rock Street Killers or whoever.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.485
- Then what?
- Then it's on.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.250
Then we take down
the whole fucking crew.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.289
We show them.
We show everybody.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.965
You can't fuck with us,

29:52.120 --> 29:54.282
like the old days
before Kanan went inside.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.484
We were young then.
Mobile.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.484
I got too much shit going on now
to go into hiding.

30:00.640 --> 30:03.962
- The kids, the club--
- Oh, wait, so now the club dictates

30:04.120 --> 30:06.726
what we do with the real business
instead of the other way around?

30:06.880 --> 30:09.565
And we opened up
the Laundromats to clean the money.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.643
I was fine with that,
but then you said,

30:11.800 --> 30:14.690
"Let's open up a nightclub.
So we can hide even more."

30:14.840 --> 30:16.888
So I agreed.
To hide the money.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.809
Period.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.246
What if there could be
more than that though, man?

30:23.400 --> 30:25.448
What if it's our retirement plan?

30:27.040 --> 30:28.724
Oh.

30:32.320 --> 30:34.209
You mean

30:34.360 --> 30:37.648
We grow up,
90 legit,

30:37.800 --> 30:40.644
live happily ever after?

30:40.800 --> 30:43.326
( Tommy laughs )

30:43.480 --> 30:46.529
I'm sor--
( laughs harder )

30:50.320 --> 30:52.561
We've been hustling together
our whole lives.

30:52.720 --> 30:56.566
I love this shit and so do you.
So focus up.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.882
I say we take Ruiz up
on his offer.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.526
We put the boys back on the street,
and if anyone steps,

31:01.680 --> 31:04.251
they light that motherfucker up.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.528
Agreed?

31:06.680 --> 31:07.886
Yeah.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.361
We'll go out and get the guns
from Ruiz tonight.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.443
I'll set it up.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.847
Go without me.
Take Julio.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.202
I gotta handle a few things at the club.
You want a place to clean our money

31:20.360 --> 31:22.089
long-term,
it's gotta stay open, right?

31:27.680 --> 31:30.365
Now that's the motherfucking
hustler I know talking.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.641
I'll see you at the club later.
I'm going now.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.683
Gotta make sure everything's
settled for tonight.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.087
Can't that new white boy do that?
You pay him enough.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.924
It's a business, baby.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.448
- It needs attention 24/7.
- So do I.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.643
Ghost, what's up?

32:01.800 --> 32:03.245
You and Tommy
behind closed doors,

32:03.440 --> 32:06.762
you running around
with this club. We okay?

32:20.240 --> 32:22.163
When we met,

32:22.320 --> 32:26.211
who'd you think I was gonna be?
Hmm?

32:26.360 --> 32:29.603
The biggest goddamn drug dealer
in New York City.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.523
You never thought about more?

32:35.720 --> 32:38.291
What more?

32:38.440 --> 32:41.683
You talking about
the club as more?

32:41.840 --> 32:43.763
I saw the money
you made last night.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.490
That's not more, it's less.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.803
You are the best at what you do.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.203
We have everything.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.442
I just want it to stay this way.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.245
What?

33:04.680 --> 33:05.920
When you come
to the club tonight,

33:06.080 --> 33:07.445
you need to look like
you own the place,

33:07.600 --> 33:08.840
not like you trying to get in for free.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.411
Wear that purple dress
I got you last month.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.005
But, baby, I like this dress.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.481

39:40.280 --> 39:42.044
Yeah, a big shipment this time.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.400
Víbora, we really
giving this away for free?

39:48.560 --> 39:50.881
This time.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.963
When we get there,
you stay in the car.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.889
Me and Poncho
will handle the drop.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.241
I set up the meeting
with the guy you asked.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.731
- Good.
- Woman: Papi.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.563
Be home by dinner so I can
take you to your mom's, okay?

40:06.440 --> 40:07.965
Okay, Pa.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.961
Vamonos.
Let's go, we're late.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.604
Ghost:
Julio tell them to check the guns?

40:25.760 --> 40:27.330
Tommy:
First thing I said to him.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.482
Think it bothers them they don't
know who they're working for?

40:29.640 --> 40:33.611
You think the fry cook
at Burger King knows the fucking CEO?

40:33.760 --> 40:35.046
They wouldn't know
that motherfucker

40:35.240 --> 40:37.925
if he walked in and asked
for extra ketchup.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.963
Don't forget.
One of these people might be the reason

40:40.160 --> 40:41.446
Cruz got jumped in the first place.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.921
Yeah, well, let's hope
he or she is afraid to get shot.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.684
We'll know soon enough.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.130
Our soldiers are strapped now.
We should be, too.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.963
All this shit going on,
how am I gonna explain to Tasha

40:55.120 --> 40:57.122
I let you run around
with no piece?

41:03.640 --> 41:06.484
Let's get 'em out on the street.
Time to make the doughnuts.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.326
Not bad for 18 years later.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.605
( Clattering )

41:31.840 --> 41:33.604
Greg.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.370
Hey, sleepyhead.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.363
You missed our run this morning.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.885
When you didn't show up
and you didn't answer your cell,

41:39.040 --> 41:40.644
I thought
maybe something was wrong.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.131
Shit.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.440
Sorry.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.682
Got here and you were in the shower,
so I thought I'd grab breakfast.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.241
Greg, I thought we said
the key was just for emergencies.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.368
Which this could've been.

41:58.520 --> 42:01.171
This just feels a little...

42:02.880 --> 42:04.245
You don't need to check on me.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.368
Come on, Angela,
I think most women

42:06.520 --> 42:09.364
would be happy to know that
someone's looking out for them.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.410
You're right.
I'm sorry.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.244
You just startled me is all.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.004
Thank you.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.768
( Cell phone vibrates )

42:25.040 --> 42:26.371
I gotta go.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.011
See you later?

42:37.400 --> 42:39.721
Angela Valdes
came into the club last night.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.803
From high school?
Wow.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.724
- What's that--
- 18 years.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.120
How'd she look?

42:45.280 --> 42:47.726
Mm.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.962
That good, huh?

42:50.120 --> 42:51.326
Yeah, well, she married now,
she got kids?

42:51.480 --> 42:53.084
No ring,
didn't say nothing about kids.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.924
You tell her about yours?

42:55.080 --> 42:56.764
- Well, we didn't talk that long.
- Oh, shit.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.126
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What that means

42:58.280 --> 42:59.486
is what are you
thinking about doing?

42:59.680 --> 43:01.762
When that girl moved away,
she seriously fucked you up.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.081
- I was there, remember?
- Aw, come on.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.288
- That was a long time ago.
- Well, Tasha's a good woman, man.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.771
You ain't never
fucked around on her before.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.843
Why do you want to go sniffing
around pussy from high school?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.490
Tommy, first of all, I can't believe

43:10.640 --> 43:11.846
you starting some shit
about monogamy.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.525
You got more bitches
than a goddamn pound,

43:13.680 --> 43:15.603
but second, I know me and Tasha
got a good thing.

43:15.760 --> 43:19.401
I'm not trying to fuck that up.
It's just got me thinking, you know,

43:19.560 --> 43:20.800
about the road not traveled,
that's all.

43:20.960 --> 43:23.247
"The road not traveled"?

43:23.400 --> 43:25.846
You are a rich,
successful motherfucker.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.042
- What more do you want?
- I want to see how Angela turned out.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.441
No, you already
saw how she turned out.

43:30.600 --> 43:34.161
Anything else is just you trying
to heal wounds from childhood.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.969
You gotta stop
watching that "Dr. Phil" shit.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.451
( Both laugh )

43:38.600 --> 43:40.329
That man
knows what he's talking about.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.130
( Ghost imitates Dr. Phil )
Shut up. Sit down.

43:42.280 --> 43:44.931
- You shut up.
- No, shut up.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.330
So long, motherfucker.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.568
You didn't ask about that
thing we did the other night.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.961
You clean it up like I said?

43:56.120 --> 43:57.406
Then there ain't nothing to ask about.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.528
- What, you think I forgot?
- Yeah, I do.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.331
Get the fuck out of here.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.650
Can I borrow this?

44:08.800 --> 44:10.802
No way, girl. That's new.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.650
But the Gucci,
you can have that.

44:12.800 --> 44:15.167
Damn, girl.
Ghost keeps you laced.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.527
Yo, I don't care.
I'll take your hand-me-downs

44:17.680 --> 44:19.523
as long as you're giving them out.

44:19.680 --> 44:22.411
So this is what
"happily ever after" looks like.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.971
You hit the lottery, girl.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.088
Niggas ain't
getting married like that,

44:26.240 --> 44:29.210
and certainly not rich niggas.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.328
He wasn't rich when I met him.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.524
You know, Keisha,

44:40.600 --> 44:43.410
clothes and bags are nice,

44:43.560 --> 44:45.562
but there are some things
about Ghost you can't see.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.245
You don't gotta
play modest with me, Tasha.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.561
I'm not playing modest.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.370
I'm not gonna die
of jealousy over here,

44:50.520 --> 44:52.841
especially if you're through
with these boots.

44:53.040 --> 44:54.246
- Hold up, what size you wear again?
- ( cell phone ringing )

44:54.400 --> 44:56.209
You know I don't get
all this European shit.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.366
Hey, baby.

45:03.520 --> 45:04.931
You out shopping with Lakeisha yet?

45:05.080 --> 45:06.491
- We're still at the house.
- Good.

45:06.680 --> 45:08.648
I got something in the oven
I need you to take care of.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.611
Tasha, you heard me?

45:12.760 --> 45:14.125
I need you
to take it out before it burns.

45:14.280 --> 45:15.770
Yes, I'm on it.

45:15.920 --> 45:17.490
Yeah.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.846
Thank you, baby.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.128
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.209
What was that?

45:24.360 --> 45:26.362
He left me some extra money
to go shopping.

45:26.520 --> 45:28.045
I'll just go get it.
I'll be right back.

45:28.240 --> 45:31.483
You see what I mean?
You hit the motherfucking lottery.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.369
Damn.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.244
( Cell phone dialing )

46:00.920 --> 46:02.285
( line ringing )

46:04.360 --> 46:06.044
( cell phone ringing )

46:08.160 --> 46:10.527
- Hello?
- Angela.

46:10.680 --> 46:14.162
- Jamie?
- You surprised I called?

46:14.320 --> 46:17.688
I told you I wasn't gonna
let you get away again, and I meant it.

46:17.840 --> 46:20.366
- Come have lunch with me.
- I can't.

46:20.520 --> 46:23.091
I have a presentation
in front of my whole office today.

46:23.240 --> 46:26.130
Yeah, and if I know you, you've been
studying on that shit for weeks.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.486
( laughs )

46:27.680 --> 46:30.684
Come on, girl.
You gotta eat.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.330
Where?

46:35.520 --> 46:37.443
( Indistinct chattering )

46:38.440 --> 46:39.930
( Speaking Spanish )

47:22.880 --> 47:24.405
I do business with niggers.

47:35.520 --> 47:36.965
Bueno.

47:38.360 --> 47:39.725
Bueno.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.371
( Music playing in headphones )

48:25.600 --> 48:27.807
New York's so different now.

48:27.960 --> 48:31.089
City bikes,
no cars in Times Square.

48:31.240 --> 48:32.571
White people living uptown.

48:32.760 --> 48:34.171
( Both laugh )

48:34.320 --> 48:37.722
You been gone a minute.
Mm.

48:37.880 --> 48:40.451
You finally got your nightclub.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.244
Your dad would've been proud.

48:43.440 --> 48:45.647
I told you
about my father's nightclub?

48:46.880 --> 48:50.202
He lost the place before we met.
I didn't remember I told you that.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.647
Yeah, we told each other
everything back then.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.165
Hmm.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.083
The last time we had lunch,

48:58.240 --> 49:00.846
I'm pretty sure there was
no linen tablecloths.

49:01.920 --> 49:05.083
- I don't think we had chairs.
- ( both laugh )

49:07.360 --> 49:11.649
We grabbed a slice
at the counter at Ray's on Sutphin.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.649
You kept refilling your Coke.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.320
The manager was giving you
that evil-ass look.

49:16.480 --> 49:19.563
- You kept going.
- The sign said, "free refills."

49:19.720 --> 49:21.290
- ( laughing )
- I was trying to get you

49:21.440 --> 49:24.125
- to stay longer.
- I almost missed my train.

49:26.120 --> 49:27.724
That was the idea.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.610
That was the idea.

49:37.200 --> 49:41.285
Choate was
the opportunity of a lifetime,

49:41.440 --> 49:44.683
but that doesn't mean
it was easy to go.

49:44.840 --> 49:46.365
Jamie, I'm sorry.

49:46.520 --> 49:49.205
I'm sorry I left the way I did.

49:50.680 --> 49:53.160
- Your parents made you go.
- But I didn't fight them.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.722
You said
you'd be back for Christmas.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.644
My family moved
to Sunnyside after I left.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.848
I had the same number.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.367
But you were just...

50:07.920 --> 50:09.649
gone.

50:12.240 --> 50:15.244
And then when my pops died,
I thought then, at least,

50:15.400 --> 50:16.731
you would reach out.

50:18.720 --> 50:20.563
I should've been there for you.

50:22.360 --> 50:24.442
But I just knew that if I called,

50:24.600 --> 50:26.728
if I heard your voice,

50:26.880 --> 50:28.928
I would go back.

50:30.680 --> 50:33.331
I would've
dropped everything for you.

50:33.480 --> 50:34.925
Everything my parents worked for,

50:35.080 --> 50:37.162
everything I'd worked for.

50:38.600 --> 50:39.840
So I made a choice.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.606
I wouldn't have asked you
to come back.

50:42.760 --> 50:44.171
You didn't belong in the hood.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.049
Neither did you.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.522
Ah.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.489
But now we're both out,

50:51.640 --> 50:53.768
just like we always planned.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.083
Not exactly how we planned.

51:01.280 --> 51:02.520
- Oh, shit.
- What?

51:02.680 --> 51:04.603
- I gotta go.
- Now?

51:04.760 --> 51:07.127
I gotta get back to the office.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.691
- All right.
- Thanks for lunch.

51:10.880 --> 51:12.962
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

51:13.960 --> 51:15.291
( Speaking Spanish )

51:22.960 --> 51:25.725
- When can we do this again?
- I'll call you.

51:31.960 --> 51:34.486
( Beeps )

51:51.000 --> 51:52.809
Don't fill out the total.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.326
Why not?

51:55.480 --> 51:57.323
I'm gonna confirm
your count at the bank.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.410
I'll take that.

52:05.040 --> 52:07.646
Every club I've ever managed,
I always do the deposit.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.280
There's a first time
for everything. Deposit slip.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.687
I already signed it.
Want a fresh one?

52:12.840 --> 52:15.969
Nah, I'm sure
yours will turn out fine.

52:16.120 --> 52:17.451
Look,
we hired you for your contacts,

52:17.600 --> 52:20.365
not your reputation.

52:20.520 --> 52:21.760
Hey, about that...

52:21.920 --> 52:23.331
boss never told me
how you found out about that.

52:23.480 --> 52:25.289
None of your
fucking business how we know.

52:25.440 --> 52:28.125
As long as you work for us,
this is how it goes.

52:28.280 --> 52:31.170
We don't have a problem,
do we?

52:31.320 --> 52:32.765
No, we don't.

52:33.840 --> 52:35.365
( Tommy chuckles )

52:56.240 --> 52:58.720
Was just about to send out
a search party for you.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.848
- You're never late.
- I know. Sorry.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.525
Lunch ran long.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.648
Frankie, I know you went out
on a limb for me.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.131
I'm not gonna blow it.

53:06.280 --> 53:08.726
If you do,
it's both our asses.

53:11.240 --> 53:12.844
Congrats on the promotion,
Valdes.

53:13.040 --> 53:14.371
Thanks, Saxe.

53:17.600 --> 53:20.410
- You're on this now?
- Just got assigned.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.881
If I request reassignment,
they're gonna ask why.

53:24.240 --> 53:27.403
I'm Francesca Lavarro,
chief of criminal division,

53:27.600 --> 53:31.605
along with my deputy,
A.U.S.A. Angela Valdes.

53:31.760 --> 53:34.206
I'll be leading this task force.

53:34.360 --> 53:37.762
Our goal is the prosecution
of one of the most notorious

53:37.920 --> 53:39.888
drug traffickers in our hemisphere,

53:40.040 --> 53:42.850
Mexican national Felipe Lobos.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.083
Lobos's brutality and vicious nature

53:46.280 --> 53:48.123
are well documented.

53:48.280 --> 53:50.169
For everyone's safety,

53:50.320 --> 53:52.926
please remember
the task force is top secret.

53:53.120 --> 53:55.691
And no one,
not even your families,

53:55.840 --> 53:58.923
can know the name of the target
of this investigation.

53:59.080 --> 54:02.641
Agent Medina, can you please
bring everybody up to speed

54:02.840 --> 54:05.081
on Lobos's movements
in New York this week?

54:05.240 --> 54:07.720
Lobos landed
at Teterboro Airport on Tuesday.

54:07.880 --> 54:09.245
Once a year,
he comes to New York to meet with

54:09.400 --> 54:11.562
his banker and his
American attorneys.

54:11.720 --> 54:14.405
Now, he did make those meetings,
but I followed him to a third,

54:14.600 --> 54:17.490
to meet this man...
Carlos "Víbora" Ruiz.

54:17.640 --> 54:20.803
Leader of the Due Loco set
of the Soldado Nation gang.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.200
We learned that, one,

54:22.400 --> 54:24.607
Lobos has one single distributor
for his product in New York City.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.525
Two, he's not entirely happy
with his distributor.

54:27.680 --> 54:30.650
And three, Soldado Nation
and Ruiz are too low-rent for Lobos.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.690
They're not organized enough
to distribute his product.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.889
And he was not shy
in telling Mr. Ruiz

54:37.080 --> 54:39.208
he did not give a fuck!

54:39.360 --> 54:41.010
( laughter )

54:42.600 --> 54:44.284
We have permission
from the Mexican government

54:44.440 --> 54:46.488
to detain and prosecute
Mr. Lobos

54:46.640 --> 54:49.007
if we can build
a compelling case against him.

54:49.160 --> 54:51.322
We can't touch him unless we know

54:51.480 --> 54:53.005
we can put him in jail.

54:53.160 --> 54:55.208
Who can give us
the names, places, and dates

54:55.360 --> 54:56.805
we need to convict Lobos?

54:56.960 --> 54:58.769
His New York distributor.

54:58.920 --> 55:01.161
Unfortunately
we have no idea who that is.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.488
We do have a profile

55:03.640 --> 55:05.483
of the type of criminal
we're looking for.

55:05.640 --> 55:07.483
( Music playing )

55:07.640 --> 55:09.768
Angela:
He's a highly organized individual

55:09.920 --> 55:12.605
with an established network
in place.

55:13.880 --> 55:16.326
He already knows how to move money
through the system,

55:16.480 --> 55:18.608
is violent enough
to control his territory,

55:18.760 --> 55:21.445
but still has something to lose...

55:22.440 --> 55:27.321
something Lobos
can threaten to keep him in line.

55:27.480 --> 55:29.881
So why is Lobos
looking to replace him?

55:30.040 --> 55:31.849
What could've gone wrong?

55:32.000 --> 55:35.209
There must be some element
out of his control.

55:53.360 --> 55:54.691
( grunts )

56:00.080 --> 56:01.411
( screams )

56:02.760 --> 56:04.046
( gun cocks )

56:04.200 --> 56:05.565
- ( gunshot )
- ( woman screams )

56:05.720 --> 56:07.404
( whimpering )

56:10.400 --> 56:11.765
Angela:
Whatever the reason,

56:11.920 --> 56:13.922
this problem between Lobos
and his local guy

56:14.080 --> 56:16.890
is exactly what we need to exploit,

56:17.040 --> 56:19.691
because the man we're looking
for is in grave danger...

56:19.840 --> 56:22.081
from Lobos and from us.

56:24.240 --> 56:25.969
We can give him a way out,

56:26.120 --> 56:28.122
but only if he decides to take it.

56:28.320 --> 56:30.163
( Cell phone vibrating )

56:32.600 --> 56:33.761
Tommy, what's up?
