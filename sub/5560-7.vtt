WEBVTT

00:00.906 --> 00:03.413
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:06.214 --> 00:07.559
It's a Navy SEAL tattoo.

00:07.594 --> 00:10.181
If she was Navy,
she'd be in our database.

00:10.506 --> 00:11.896
Not if she was
special ops.

00:11.931 --> 00:14.204
Something happened
last night with Weller.

00:14.239 --> 00:16.897
Your relationship with
Agent Weller is complicated.

00:16.932 --> 00:18.863
Maybe you need to establish
clearer boundaries.

00:18.898 --> 00:20.855
I think we need to
consider you stepping down

00:20.890 --> 00:22.458
as lead agent
on this case.

00:22.493 --> 00:23.591
It's not necessary.

00:23.626 --> 00:24.999
Saul Guerrero, his case number

00:25.001 --> 00:26.092
is on Jane's body.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.301
I've been digging
through his file,

00:27.336 --> 00:28.499
but it's pretty redacted.

00:28.534 --> 00:29.412
Talk to Mayfair.

00:29.447 --> 00:30.818
I did, she won't help.

00:30.853 --> 00:34.334
If that girl has information
about Daylight on her body,

00:34.369 --> 00:37.078
then we are in
very serious trouble.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.044
It was a dream.

00:38.079 --> 00:38.821
A sex dream.

00:38.856 --> 00:40.840
So, who do you think he was,
this dream man?

00:40.875 --> 00:42.842
That guy had
a tattoo of a tree

00:42.877 --> 00:45.298
on his arm, and Weller
doesn't have that.

01:03.241 --> 01:05.673
_

01:07.711 --> 01:09.145
Okay.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.206
If the wrong
people find it...

01:13.241 --> 01:14.482
The right people will.

01:14.484 --> 01:17.385
How can you be sure?

01:17.387 --> 01:18.886
Because I have to be.

01:26.435 --> 01:28.824
_

01:28.859 --> 01:30.450
Have you seen
my keys?

01:30.485 --> 01:33.367
Does that look like
a bridge to you?

01:33.369 --> 01:34.996
No, it's a tunnel.

01:35.031 --> 01:37.395
I swear that I put
them on the table.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.274
No, it's definitely a bridge.

01:39.309 --> 01:41.008
Check... check under
my gym bag.

01:42.691 --> 01:44.211
Yes!

01:44.213 --> 01:45.900
Okay, I gotta go.

01:45.935 --> 01:47.815
I know I've
seen this before.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.717
Are you okay
to lock up?

01:51.333 --> 01:53.734
I should have
my own key.

01:53.769 --> 01:55.089
Hmm?

01:55.091 --> 01:57.242
Well, I sleep here
every night.

01:57.277 --> 01:58.475
We basically
already live together.

01:58.510 --> 02:02.129
Shouldn't we...
make it official?

02:02.131 --> 02:03.931
Uh...

02:03.933 --> 02:05.788
Now, listen,
before you freak out...

02:05.823 --> 02:09.457
No, I'm not freaking out,
I'm totally not freaking out.

02:09.491 --> 02:14.192
I just... you know,
the landlord is... the worst.

02:14.227 --> 02:18.539
And the hot water situation,
and there's only one bedroom.

02:18.574 --> 02:20.343
I don't need
my own room.

02:20.378 --> 02:24.251
I just... I'm... I'm...
I'm messy.

02:24.253 --> 02:26.234
No, you're not.

02:26.269 --> 02:28.255
I...

02:28.257 --> 02:30.390
Most of my stuff
is already here.

02:30.425 --> 02:31.672
All my plants are dead,
I haven't been back

02:31.707 --> 02:33.291
to my apartment
in over a month.

02:33.326 --> 02:34.550
But you love
your apartment.

02:34.585 --> 02:36.330
I like my apartment.

02:36.332 --> 02:38.165
I love you.

02:38.167 --> 02:40.034
Oh, man.

02:43.271 --> 02:44.828
Do you wanna talk
about this later?

02:44.863 --> 02:46.367
I do, I do.

02:46.402 --> 02:48.777
I would like
to talk about this later.

02:48.812 --> 02:50.044
Not never.

02:50.046 --> 02:51.643
Later.
Later today.

02:51.678 --> 02:53.872
Yes, later today.
Just later.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.773
I love talks, I love 'em.

02:55.808 --> 02:57.778
Just, uh, looking
forward to it.

02:57.813 --> 02:59.420
Mmm.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.055
Is there a reason you're
waving Patterson

03:13.090 --> 03:15.803
off this case?

03:15.805 --> 03:17.875
This is a sensitive file.

03:17.910 --> 03:20.775
And Guerrero's file number
is tattooed on Jane's body.

03:20.777 --> 03:21.917
So, if there
is a connection,

03:21.952 --> 03:23.611
we need to follow
that lead now.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.749
What aren't
you telling me?

03:34.924 --> 03:38.882
For a decade, Saul Guerrero
was a confidential informant.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.094
I was his handler.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.013
Why is this the first time
I've heard about that?

03:44.048 --> 03:45.949
Guerrero was upper echelon.

03:45.984 --> 03:49.837
He had critical,
otherwise unobtainable intel.

03:49.839 --> 03:52.001
His tips got us warrants
for wire taps,

03:52.036 --> 03:54.175
seizures, you name it.

03:54.177 --> 03:55.643
So, what happened?

03:55.645 --> 03:58.694
The 'Ndrangheta started
making moves on the boroughs.

03:58.729 --> 04:00.789
Guerrero didn't wanna
play nice with them,

04:00.824 --> 04:02.750
so he started
playing games with us.

04:02.752 --> 04:05.319
Had us chasing our tails
while he piled up bodies.

04:05.321 --> 04:06.983
You had to know you
were playing with fire.

04:07.018 --> 04:09.812
Soon as I figured out
we couldn't trust the intel,

04:09.847 --> 04:12.626
we tried to shut him down,
indict him.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.628
But there was a leak.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.512
Guerrero went dark,
and no one's heard from him

04:17.548 --> 04:19.600
in over two years.

04:19.601 --> 04:22.814
It's redacted because
our involvement with Guerrero

04:22.849 --> 04:24.936
is a major embarrassment
upstairs.

04:24.971 --> 04:27.808
I can't have Patterson
shaking that tree.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.527
I understand, but this
is the only direct FBI case

04:30.562 --> 04:32.890
on Jane's body.

04:33.883 --> 04:37.117
Looks like Patterson
got another tattoo lead.

04:37.119 --> 04:38.495
What do you got?

04:38.530 --> 04:40.946
At first, all I could see
was this turtle shell.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.430
But then I realized the
patterns were less scute-like

04:43.465 --> 04:44.668
and more coral-like.

04:44.703 --> 04:45.996
It's a Petoskey stone,

04:46.031 --> 04:48.059
which is the official
state stone of Michigan.

04:48.094 --> 04:49.227
Go, blue!

04:49.262 --> 04:50.312
You guys know I still
hold the record...

04:50.347 --> 04:52.282
Record for most consecutive
games with a catch?

04:52.317 --> 04:54.185
No, you've never
mentioned that.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.604
Looking closer, one of
the stone's coral patterns

04:56.639 --> 04:59.948
is very purposely shaped
like Alpena County.

04:59.983 --> 05:01.587
And the Alpena
pattern contains

05:01.622 --> 05:04.945
an address in an
unincorporated community

05:04.947 --> 05:07.514
in Draclyn Township.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.950
What's the problem?

05:09.952 --> 05:11.188
Draclyn's the problem.

05:11.223 --> 05:15.206
It sits along the old
Detroit-Mackinac oil pipeline.

05:15.241 --> 05:17.991
Ten years ago they were
on the brink of ruin

05:18.026 --> 05:20.269
when a flood of cash
saved the community.

05:20.304 --> 05:23.238
We always suspected
illegal arms dealing

05:23.273 --> 05:24.988
but we could never
prove it.

05:25.023 --> 05:27.069
I don't understand.
If they're running guns,

05:27.104 --> 05:28.602
why don't we just
arrest them?

05:28.637 --> 05:30.027
Draclyn has strong
ties to Michigan

05:30.062 --> 05:31.705
secessionist groups.
They're off the grid.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.645
Anti-government,
anti-law enforcement.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.643
Which makes policing
Draclyn a nightmare.

05:35.645 --> 05:38.145
So, how do we
get in there?

05:38.147 --> 05:39.579
Peacefully.

05:39.614 --> 05:41.822
If we dig up a cold case
that the town cares about

05:41.857 --> 05:44.367
and use it as a pretense
to investigate the address,

05:44.402 --> 05:46.058
that shouldn't ring
too many alarm bells.

05:46.093 --> 05:47.327
Works for me.

05:47.362 --> 05:49.415
I'll call the sheriff,
let him know you're coming.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.442
I'll dig something up,
send it to you on the plane.

05:51.477 --> 05:53.133
Thanks.

05:53.168 --> 05:55.015
Sorry, a... plane?

06:01.336 --> 06:02.646
So, I guess you weren't
a fan of flying

06:02.681 --> 06:04.248
in your past life, huh?

06:04.283 --> 06:05.481
No, I guess not.

06:07.777 --> 06:09.612
It's okay, a doctor
once told me

06:09.647 --> 06:11.445
that turbulence
can't take down a flight.

06:11.447 --> 06:12.587
Well, I'd feel
a lot more comfortable

06:12.622 --> 06:14.581
if a pilot told you that.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.584
How's Patterson doing with
that cold case cover story?

06:17.586 --> 06:19.954
She just sent us
the uplink.

06:22.487 --> 06:24.254
That'll work.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.942
Kurt Weller, FBI.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.866
Paul Bolton,
county sheriff.

06:43.901 --> 06:46.714
I understand you folks are
looking to head into Draclyn.

06:46.716 --> 06:48.309
You sure you wanna
do that?

06:48.344 --> 06:50.050
We're taking over
a cold case.

06:50.052 --> 06:52.336
We thought you might
appreciate some fresh eyes

06:52.371 --> 06:53.767
on the Mark Wyman
investigation.

06:53.802 --> 06:57.057
Mark Wyman was killed
four and a half years ago.

06:57.059 --> 06:58.938
You really expect me
to believe the FBI

06:58.973 --> 07:01.095
suddenly cares
about him now?

07:01.097 --> 07:02.948
Well, some new evidence
has come to light.

07:02.983 --> 07:04.020
If it can help
the community here

07:04.055 --> 07:05.271
- have some peace of mind...
- Listen.

07:05.306 --> 07:08.035
This is not
a safe place.

07:08.037 --> 07:10.604
These people don't
recognize your authority

07:10.606 --> 07:12.339
and they don't
respect you.

07:12.341 --> 07:13.701
They're aggressive,

07:13.736 --> 07:15.828
and you know as well
as I do they're armed.

07:15.863 --> 07:17.381
I've seen it get
real ugly, real quick.

07:17.416 --> 07:19.947
Hell, I don't even go into
Draclyn if I can help it.

07:19.949 --> 07:21.815
We appreciate the heads-up.

07:24.753 --> 07:27.766
- How many bars you got?
- One.

07:27.801 --> 07:31.551
It's only gonna get worse
the further in you go.

07:31.586 --> 07:33.333
Cell towers kept
getting torn down

07:33.368 --> 07:36.163
and sold for parts when the
township was in dire straits.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.261
Eventually the phone
companies got smart,

07:38.296 --> 07:39.467
stayed away.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.535
We'll take our chances.

07:43.738 --> 07:45.762
Call Mayfair, tell her
we're off the grid.

07:54.816 --> 07:56.450
We've got trouble.

08:10.893 --> 08:13.395
3196... this is it.

08:15.465 --> 08:17.371
Excuse me, sir.

08:17.373 --> 08:20.307
My name is Kurt Weller,
I'm an agent with the FBI.

08:20.309 --> 08:23.477
Is this your residence?

08:23.479 --> 08:27.414
Sir, I'm talking to you.
Do you live here?

08:31.052 --> 08:33.381
Well, I'm not the gardener,
if that's what you're asking.

08:33.417 --> 08:35.389
Show me your hands.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.157
- Get on your knees.
- Don't you move. Don't move!

08:37.159 --> 08:40.327
Whoa, whoa,
what's happening?

08:40.328 --> 08:43.664
Saul Guerrero,
you're under arrest.

08:50.656 --> 08:55.656
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

09:00.452 --> 09:01.614
So, which is it, hands up,

09:01.649 --> 09:03.151
down on the ground,
or don't move?

09:03.186 --> 09:04.151
Get down on your knees,
put your hands

09:04.186 --> 09:05.347
on your head,
and don't move.

09:05.382 --> 09:06.756
Who's Saul Guerrero?

09:06.758 --> 09:07.592
This man is number two

09:07.627 --> 09:09.348
on the FBI's
Most Wanted List.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.635
We got RICO warrants out
on him for 19 murders.

09:11.670 --> 09:12.769
Alleged murders.

09:12.804 --> 09:15.064
Terrorized New York
for over 20 years.

09:15.947 --> 09:17.425
So, this is where
you've been the whole time?

09:17.460 --> 09:18.739
Oh, I love it here.

09:18.774 --> 09:21.513
Fresh air, starry skies,
friendly neighbors.

09:21.548 --> 09:24.373
The illegal arms.
It was you.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.675
What'd you do, buy
yourself some protection?

09:26.677 --> 09:28.669
The people here have
very strict instructions

09:28.704 --> 09:30.946
not to let anyone
take me away.

09:32.849 --> 09:34.092
Inside.

09:34.127 --> 09:35.818
Get inside.

09:44.879 --> 09:46.973
Stop. Turn around.

09:47.008 --> 09:49.131
You got any
weapons on you?

09:50.167 --> 09:51.333
Clear.

09:51.335 --> 09:52.821
Any of you see
a landline?

09:52.856 --> 09:54.638
Landline?
Who am I gonna call?

09:54.673 --> 09:57.457
Sit down.

09:57.492 --> 09:58.808
Kurt.

09:58.810 --> 10:00.242
Huh?

10:00.244 --> 10:01.363
Place looks
really clean.

10:01.398 --> 10:03.946
No guns, no drugs,
no cash anywhere.

10:03.948 --> 10:07.354
Something's not right.
It's too easy.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.473
Do a final sweep,
check everything, all right?

10:09.508 --> 10:10.707
Then we'll move.

10:15.226 --> 10:16.830
Do you know me?

10:18.662 --> 10:20.396
Have we met before?

10:20.398 --> 10:24.064
Oh, I think
I'd remember you.

10:31.268 --> 10:33.201
Someone slashed
the tires.

10:37.447 --> 10:39.249
Our long arms
and vests are gone.

10:39.284 --> 10:41.884
It's okay, we can
drive out on the rims.

10:45.021 --> 10:46.666
Fuel line's cut too.

10:46.701 --> 10:48.257
We're not going
anywhere in this thing.

10:48.259 --> 10:50.025
That's your play?

10:50.027 --> 10:51.827
Get someone
to try and stop us?

10:51.829 --> 10:54.130
You're not getting
out of Draclyn alive.

11:02.706 --> 11:03.906
Hey.

11:03.908 --> 11:04.965
Hey, listen.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.965
I'm... I'm sorry
about this morning.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.679
I just... I... I was
kinda taken by...

11:10.681 --> 11:12.047
I love you.

11:12.049 --> 11:14.837
<i>And of course,
I love you, it's just,</i>

11:14.872 --> 11:16.794
this is good, this is
really, really good.

11:16.829 --> 11:18.387
So why mess it up?

11:18.389 --> 11:19.349
Hey, can I talk?

11:19.384 --> 11:21.056
<i>No, just... not yet.</i>

11:22.543 --> 11:27.429
Everyone that's moved in
moves out within six months.

11:27.431 --> 11:32.535
And if you don't move in,
then you can't move out.

11:32.537 --> 11:34.175
And I know that's ridiculous

11:34.210 --> 11:35.553
and it doesn't make
a ton of sense, but...

11:35.588 --> 11:37.973
It's not a tunnel,
it's an arch.

11:37.975 --> 11:40.809
"It's not a tunnel, it's an..."

11:40.811 --> 11:43.179
Sorry, is that
a metaphor?

11:43.214 --> 11:44.149
No, it's... it's an arch.

11:44.184 --> 11:46.140
- It's a literal arch.
- <i>What?</i>

11:46.175 --> 11:48.918
<i>I figured out
the tattoo.</i>

11:49.953 --> 11:50.964
It's an arch.

11:50.999 --> 11:53.355
Ask me where I'm
standing right now.

11:53.357 --> 11:56.725
Think New York history,
your hood.

11:57.727 --> 11:59.923
The Brooklyn
Historical Society.

11:59.958 --> 12:02.273
Yeah, and there's
another clue.

12:02.308 --> 12:03.056
Come meet me,
we'll figure out

12:03.091 --> 12:04.567
the next part
of the puzzle together.

12:04.569 --> 12:05.833
Wait, you're there?

12:05.868 --> 12:07.602
David!
No, no, no, no, no.

12:07.637 --> 12:09.159
You have to go home,
you can't be there.

12:09.194 --> 12:11.219
I'll... I'll have the team
follow up tomorrow.

12:11.254 --> 12:13.282
Nah, I'm here now, I'm gonna
try to figure it out.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.641
<i>David, don't.</i>

12:14.676 --> 12:17.313
I'll let you know
when I solve it.

12:18.748 --> 12:20.950
Damn it.

12:23.253 --> 12:24.773
I have to admit, I never thought

12:24.808 --> 12:27.289
the FBI would come
to Draclyn.

12:27.291 --> 12:30.626
Life's full of surprises.

12:30.628 --> 12:33.629
If you don't mind my asking,
how exactly did you find me?

12:33.631 --> 12:35.664
Just to be clear...

12:35.666 --> 12:39.134
you have the right
to remain silent.

12:39.136 --> 12:40.515
It's a long walk.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.438
Yeah, whose fault
is that?

12:42.440 --> 12:43.885
Oh, cheer up, <i>mamacita.</i>

12:43.920 --> 12:46.396
A little fresh air
won't kill you.

12:46.431 --> 12:47.534
The looks on your faces

12:47.569 --> 12:49.678
when I turned around.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.481
You had no idea what
you were walking into.

12:53.956 --> 12:57.519
What about you,
painted lady, huh?

12:57.521 --> 13:00.289
Tell me how you found me
and I'll let you live.

13:00.291 --> 13:03.892
We found you.
What do you care how?

13:03.894 --> 13:05.928
Jane.

13:05.930 --> 13:08.364
I just want to know
who to kill around here.

13:08.366 --> 13:10.935
Nobody outside Draclyn
knows where I am.

13:10.970 --> 13:13.488
Someone out there knew
exactly where you were.

13:13.523 --> 13:15.900
Jane, enough.

13:18.028 --> 13:19.251
Get down!

13:20.783 --> 13:21.810
Get down!

13:29.919 --> 13:31.194
Aah!

13:32.202 --> 13:33.689
Stand down! Stand down!

13:33.724 --> 13:35.945
<i>Backup is on the way.
Do you copy?</i>

13:37.419 --> 13:39.094
I'm gonna grab that radio.

13:45.044 --> 13:47.498
All right, we gotta
get off this road.

13:47.533 --> 13:48.981
Which way are they coming
from, which way do we go?

13:49.016 --> 13:51.538
I don't know but
we can't stay here

13:51.573 --> 13:52.590
and we can't go back.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.006
The trees are
our best bet.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.911
That way.

14:00.183 --> 14:02.881
No way.
What if it's a trap?

14:02.916 --> 14:05.113
It's not a trap,
it's a beacon.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.489
You don't know that.
Following your tattoos

14:06.524 --> 14:07.881
got us here
and got us shot at.

14:07.916 --> 14:09.834
The tattoos
led to Guerrero.

14:09.869 --> 14:11.288
Why send us out here
just to kill us?

14:11.323 --> 14:13.600
How'd they know we'd be in this
exact spot at this exact moment

14:13.635 --> 14:14.898
- to see the derricks?
- They didn't.

14:14.933 --> 14:17.366
The derricks are
above the tree line.

14:17.368 --> 14:19.170
You can see 'em from
a lot of places.

14:19.205 --> 14:21.708
Whoever did this wants us
to get out of here alive,

14:21.743 --> 14:22.939
with Guerrero.

14:22.974 --> 14:24.072
And going to the oil derricks

14:24.107 --> 14:25.793
brings us farther in,
not out.

14:25.828 --> 14:27.509
Zapata,
back me up here.

14:27.511 --> 14:28.696
It's not my call.

14:28.731 --> 14:30.109
Well, it's damn sure
not her call.

14:30.144 --> 14:31.290
This road is compromised.

14:31.325 --> 14:33.430
So, we follow the tattoos.

14:33.465 --> 14:35.417
Turn around.
Walk.

14:48.732 --> 14:50.225
All right.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.501
We're here.
Now, what?

14:52.503 --> 14:54.156
I... I don't know.

14:54.191 --> 14:56.772
I thought that there
would be something here.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.373
Maybe there's a clue
hidden in the graffiti.

15:00.408 --> 15:02.262
What is this,
a scavenger hunt?

15:02.297 --> 15:04.838
Hey.
Shut up.

15:04.873 --> 15:06.299
Check all the tags
on the wall.

15:06.334 --> 15:08.529
See if any of 'em
line up with Jane's.

15:10.955 --> 15:13.122
Hey, do you hear that?

15:13.124 --> 15:15.090
Sounds hollow.

15:15.092 --> 15:19.161
These floorboards are
newer than the other ones.

15:22.723 --> 15:24.433
- Tasha, bring your cuffs?
- Yeah.

15:36.666 --> 15:40.056
How much you make
as an FBI agent?

15:40.091 --> 15:42.317
50? 80?

15:44.120 --> 15:47.393
You really wanna die
for 80-grand a year?

15:47.428 --> 15:48.504
Well, maybe I
shouldn't be talking

15:48.539 --> 15:50.068
to the brawn of
the operation.

15:50.103 --> 15:51.775
Who's got the brains
around here?

15:51.810 --> 15:55.497
You... how much
do the FBI pay you?

16:01.393 --> 16:02.805
So...

16:02.807 --> 16:05.168
Got a four-letter
alphabet lock.

16:05.211 --> 16:06.441
Anyone got an idea?

16:06.577 --> 16:08.395
Why don't we try "JANE"?

16:09.166 --> 16:11.463
No... we gave her
that name.

16:14.649 --> 16:16.450
Try "SHAW."

16:18.644 --> 16:20.106
Try "DEAD."

16:22.592 --> 16:23.743
Kurt.

16:23.778 --> 16:24.596
What?

16:24.631 --> 16:28.430
No. "KURT."
Try K-U-R-T.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.887
Why would it be "KURT"?

16:29.922 --> 16:31.350
Because the tattoo
of Kurt's name

16:31.385 --> 16:34.060
is right below the
oil derricks on my back.

16:42.384 --> 16:43.597
Go.

16:46.983 --> 16:49.251
There's a map.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.011
Wait...

16:52.193 --> 16:54.430
Hey, there's
something underneath.

16:55.992 --> 16:56.959
Got it?

16:59.095 --> 17:01.096
What is all that
doing here?

17:01.131 --> 17:03.799
It's our way out.

17:11.383 --> 17:13.454
All right.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.811
So, whoever left
us this box

17:14.847 --> 17:17.239
full of guns
also left water

17:17.273 --> 17:18.242
and head lamps,
which means

17:18.277 --> 17:20.336
this might drag on
into the night.

17:20.422 --> 17:21.741
Can't drink that water.

17:21.776 --> 17:23.519
You think they laced it?

17:23.554 --> 17:24.844
Why even take the chance?

17:27.146 --> 17:29.009
They also drew a map
inside the lid

17:29.044 --> 17:30.338
complete with an
"X" marks the spot.

17:30.373 --> 17:31.650
So, let's go.

17:31.652 --> 17:32.977
No, not yet.

17:33.012 --> 17:34.520
We've got the high ground.

17:34.522 --> 17:36.922
So, we hold tight
and wait till nightfall.

17:36.924 --> 17:38.655
Then we move to that "X."

17:38.690 --> 17:40.937
Wait, you're not
blindly following

17:40.972 --> 17:44.263
a bunch of riddles
in her tattoos?

17:44.265 --> 17:46.832
And you don't even know
who put them on her body?

17:46.834 --> 17:48.694
They're at the oil derricks.

17:48.729 --> 17:51.070
Hey, stay off the radio, man!

17:51.072 --> 17:52.805
They tracked us
through the woods?

17:52.807 --> 17:53.873
No.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.376
They're tracking him.

17:57.378 --> 17:58.307
How? I thought
you frisked him.

17:58.342 --> 17:59.750
Stand up.

17:59.785 --> 18:01.735
I did.

18:01.770 --> 18:03.949
But not for a tracker.

18:03.951 --> 18:05.284
What do you got?

18:05.286 --> 18:06.397
It might be
in his watch.

18:06.432 --> 18:08.587
Then look.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.258
Weller...

18:12.260 --> 18:14.360
No, Jane!
Don't smash it.

18:14.362 --> 18:16.949
They don't know
we found it.

18:16.984 --> 18:19.298
All right...
we're splitting up.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.067
I'll draw the gunmen away,
then I'll drop this tracker.

18:22.069 --> 18:23.423
I'll meet you guys
at the rendezvous point.

18:23.458 --> 18:24.781
You're not going alone.

18:24.816 --> 18:26.149
I'll go too.

18:26.184 --> 18:27.513
Take me with you.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.234
Zapata.

18:31.269 --> 18:33.045
You're with me.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.881
Come on,
let's get going.

18:43.616 --> 18:46.045
Oh, my God!
David!

18:46.080 --> 18:47.657
You can't have this
outside my apartment.

18:47.692 --> 18:49.565
I'm not even supposed to have
this <i>inside</i> my apartment.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.904
I know, I just needed to make
sure this was the right spot.

18:51.939 --> 18:53.537
Does 708 mean
anything to you?

18:53.572 --> 18:55.604
- No, let's go.
- Look, look.

18:55.639 --> 18:57.118
The bricks along
the top of the real arch

18:57.153 --> 18:59.707
- are totally bare.
- David, I am serious.

18:59.742 --> 19:00.766
- You have to stop.
- Okay, but the bricks

19:00.801 --> 19:02.163
in the tattoo arch
have Roman numerals

19:02.198 --> 19:03.552
etched into them, see?

19:03.587 --> 19:05.809
D-C-C-V-I-I-I.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.279
708.

19:07.281 --> 19:08.577
Now, I tried
the Dewey Decimal System

19:08.612 --> 19:10.516
- but that was a dead end.
- I know what you're doing...

19:10.518 --> 19:13.006
700 brings you to the arts,
708 is museums,

19:13.041 --> 19:14.316
galleries,
and private collections.

19:14.351 --> 19:15.542
I mean, unless we're
supposed to check every book

19:15.577 --> 19:18.324
- in the entire section.
- What if it's...

19:18.326 --> 19:20.095
What if it's
an ISBN?

19:20.130 --> 19:22.603
Every book in the world
has its own unique

19:22.638 --> 19:24.598
International
Standard Book Number.

19:24.633 --> 19:27.149
True, but ISBNs
are 13 digits.

19:27.184 --> 19:29.468
Right. So...

19:29.470 --> 19:31.888
What if it's not 708?

19:31.923 --> 19:33.702
What if we...
we break the numerals

19:33.737 --> 19:36.375
into their individual
letter values?

19:36.377 --> 19:39.144
500, 100, 100, five.

19:39.146 --> 19:41.213
One, one, one.

19:41.604 --> 19:43.674
That's 13 digits.

19:44.493 --> 19:45.820
Okay.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.038
_

19:48.073 --> 19:49.231
_

19:49.266 --> 19:51.108
Hmm, I really
thought we had it.

19:51.143 --> 19:54.211
Wait... ISBNs were
only ten-digit numbers

19:54.246 --> 19:56.041
before 2007,
so what if the book

19:56.076 --> 19:57.711
we're looking for
is older?

19:57.746 --> 20:01.257
I'm gonna try it without
the last three digits.

20:01.292 --> 20:02.410
_

20:02.445 --> 20:03.521
Got it.

20:03.556 --> 20:07.270
"Faculty Decisions,
1787 to 1792."

20:07.305 --> 20:09.138
Okay.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.523
Here it is.

20:24.525 --> 20:26.191
- Can you reach it?
- Yeah.

20:26.193 --> 20:28.027
- 'Cause you're tall.
- Yeah.

20:28.029 --> 20:30.621
So, assuming that you're right,
and I assume that you are,

20:30.656 --> 20:32.185
what are the three
leftover numbers?

20:32.220 --> 20:35.067
Page number.
Turn to 111.

20:39.763 --> 20:41.640
Look!

20:41.642 --> 20:45.004
Someone circled a bunch
of random letters.

20:45.039 --> 20:46.945
It's a secret code.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.684
Hey.

20:51.686 --> 20:53.085
Hold up.

20:53.087 --> 20:54.729
We can drop
the tracker off soon,

20:54.764 --> 20:55.854
but we gotta
slow down.

20:55.856 --> 20:57.489
They're right on us.

20:57.491 --> 20:58.757
Guerrero wouldn't run.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.459
If we move too fast,

21:00.461 --> 21:02.677
they'll know that we
don't have him with us.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.798
You volunteered for it.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.533
So did Jane.

21:07.535 --> 21:08.967
But I trust
your training.

21:08.969 --> 21:10.869
Jane's still
a wild card.

21:10.871 --> 21:13.238
Is that really why
I'm here and she's not?

21:13.240 --> 21:16.408
You got something to say,
just say it.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.111
You're protecting her.

21:19.113 --> 21:22.081
She's more than just
an FBI asset to you.

21:24.104 --> 21:28.053
It is one thing if you
won't admit it.

21:28.055 --> 21:31.298
It is something else
if you don't even know it.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.574
What could you possibly
be hoping to find

21:41.609 --> 21:43.769
this far into the forest?

21:43.771 --> 21:46.245
He's got a point,
we could be chasing our tails.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.508
No, the landmarks on the map
have all been right so far.

21:49.510 --> 21:51.009
The sun's low.

21:51.011 --> 21:52.816
We head west,
follow the light,

21:52.851 --> 21:56.682
the rendezvous point should
be just around this next bend.

21:56.684 --> 21:58.177
I hope you're right.

21:58.212 --> 22:01.019
She's right.
It's just up ahead.

22:01.021 --> 22:02.914
I saw the map.
This is my backyard.

22:02.949 --> 22:04.288
I know where
we're going.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.956
Move.

22:07.822 --> 22:09.475
_

22:17.337 --> 22:19.094
They're headed for
the old ranger station.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.873
Let's go!

22:25.779 --> 22:29.014
Radio's busted.

22:29.016 --> 22:31.900
Do you see anything or do we
have to tear this place apart?

22:31.935 --> 22:33.882
The anticipation
is killing me.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.386
You know what, your little
play-by-play ain't helping.

22:39.018 --> 22:41.364
Here... this map.

22:41.399 --> 22:42.797
I recognize
the topography.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.830
- You sure?
- Trust me.

22:44.832 --> 22:46.647
I know my own tattoos.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.288
Mmm!
I was wondering

22:57.323 --> 23:00.346
when those tattoos would
lead us to the treasure.

23:00.381 --> 23:02.722
Lay this map over
the back of my calf.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.371
It's an exact match.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.378
Only there's a red
"X" on your calf

23:18.413 --> 23:20.109
that isn't on the map.

23:21.018 --> 23:25.037
Still think we're being
led into a trap?

23:25.039 --> 23:27.406
There's only one
way to find out.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.185
Let 'em follow
that for a while.

23:40.187 --> 23:42.211
Now we can run
to the RV point.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.755
I'll beat you there.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.892
Down! Down!

24:05.186 --> 24:06.298
Clear on my side.

24:06.333 --> 24:07.813
Clear.

24:07.815 --> 24:10.224
Is that all they got?

24:11.619 --> 24:12.994
Why'd they peel
off like that?

24:13.029 --> 24:15.148
'Cause they saw that
we haven't got Guerrero.

24:15.183 --> 24:17.768
Let's get to Reade
and Jane... move.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.406
You realize you're going
deeper into the forest?

24:26.441 --> 24:28.523
That sign
isn't a suggestion.

24:28.558 --> 24:30.102
Back in the '70s,
the U.S. government

24:30.137 --> 24:32.676
buried nuclear waste in an old
mine somewhere back here.

24:32.711 --> 24:34.256
Unless you wanna
glow in the dark,

24:34.291 --> 24:36.300
I suggest you turn around.

24:36.302 --> 24:38.289
Remember when I said
it was a trap?

24:38.324 --> 24:40.222
If they wanted to kill us,
why help us at all?

24:40.257 --> 24:42.868
You really think it's smart
to leave the ranger station?

24:42.903 --> 24:46.713
How are mamacita and the
Boy Scout supposed to find us?

24:46.748 --> 24:48.772
Though... I suppose it
doesn't really matter,

24:48.807 --> 24:51.363
since by now
they're probably dead.

24:52.584 --> 24:54.118
They're alive.

24:54.153 --> 24:55.545
I saw the look on
your face when Kurt

24:55.580 --> 24:57.824
didn't pick you
to go with him.

25:00.727 --> 25:03.274
Actually, I hope
he's still alive.

25:03.356 --> 25:05.985
That way, you can watch
while I cut off his head.

25:06.826 --> 25:09.267
I'll be sure to do it
nice and slow.

25:09.269 --> 25:11.108
- Uhh!
- Jane, Jane!

25:12.216 --> 25:13.813
You need me alive!

25:13.848 --> 25:15.679
The FBI needs you alive.

25:15.714 --> 25:17.408
Hey, hey, all right,
that's enough.

25:17.410 --> 25:18.809
Calm down, okay?

25:18.811 --> 25:20.123
Go take a walk.

25:20.158 --> 25:21.913
I'll pretend I didn't
see anything.

25:21.948 --> 25:23.848
He's alive.

25:28.654 --> 25:29.854
Get up.

25:32.024 --> 25:33.927
<i>Bolton.</i>

25:33.962 --> 25:37.446
Sheriff, this is Assistant
Director Mayfair, FBI.

25:37.481 --> 25:39.113
<i>I know my team's
comms are out,</i>

25:39.148 --> 25:41.766
<i>but I'm curious about
the situation up there.</i>

25:41.768 --> 25:43.984
Uh, the situation's all good.

25:44.019 --> 25:45.349
<i>I just spoke
with your guys.</i>

25:45.384 --> 25:48.277
They're kicking the tires
of that cold case of theirs.

25:48.312 --> 25:51.476
Do me a favor and have them
check in as soon as they can.

25:51.511 --> 25:53.244
I'll take care of it.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.589
Hey, Reade, I think I found
that little red "X."

26:07.626 --> 26:09.226
What, no quip?

26:09.228 --> 26:11.095
We just might
make it out of here.

26:14.166 --> 26:15.933
You know how
to fly this thing?

26:15.935 --> 26:19.236
Nope, but I got
a feeling you can.

26:19.238 --> 26:20.705
Didn't you see
my on the plane?

26:20.707 --> 26:22.328
Doesn't matter,
just fire it up, Jane.

26:22.363 --> 26:23.621
I don't know.

26:23.656 --> 26:25.562
Even if I could start it,
let alone fly it,

26:25.597 --> 26:27.844
if someone hears...

26:27.879 --> 26:30.261
Weller and Zapata are heading
to the ranger station.

26:30.296 --> 26:32.717
We should double back
and wait for them.

26:32.719 --> 26:34.251
You're right.

26:34.253 --> 26:35.602
All right,
let's go.

26:44.596 --> 26:47.407
You twist your lips
when you're writing.

26:47.442 --> 26:49.694
I twist my lips when
I'm frustrated.

26:49.729 --> 26:52.478
Is this a code
or is this a cipher?

26:52.513 --> 26:54.806
My code-breaking software
is so much faster than we are.

26:54.841 --> 26:56.159
I should get this
back to the lab.

26:56.194 --> 26:57.979
Hey, come on,
your software

26:58.014 --> 27:00.384
can't stand in that arch
and compare the bricks.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.080
And it can't pull this
book off the top shelf

27:02.115 --> 27:03.614
and flip
to the right page.

27:03.616 --> 27:05.710
- We're close here.
- You just wanna solve it.

27:05.745 --> 27:07.518
Damn right,
I wanna solve it.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.988
So do you.

27:09.988 --> 27:11.856
I can do this here.

27:14.138 --> 27:15.774
_

27:17.654 --> 27:20.376
You know why it didn't work
out with those other guys?

27:21.733 --> 27:23.367
Because it didn't.

27:25.270 --> 27:27.464
That's... whoo!
Insightful.

27:27.499 --> 27:29.507
Hey, just because it hasn't
worked out in the past

27:29.509 --> 27:32.786
doesn't mean it can't
work out in the future.

27:32.821 --> 27:34.879
Sometimes you gotta
take a leap.

27:36.882 --> 27:40.185
I'm just not
built that way.

27:40.220 --> 27:42.463
I know.

27:42.498 --> 27:44.021
But I am.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.688
What a fine-balanced
couple we make.

27:58.270 --> 27:59.561
Where's Patterson?

27:59.596 --> 28:02.173
I don't know, she's
been gone for a while.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.677
_

28:11.383 --> 28:12.827
You blew it.
You had a chance

28:12.862 --> 28:14.892
to get out and you came
back for your friends.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.253
Is that what this is about?

28:16.255 --> 28:17.451
You never had
any friends?

28:17.486 --> 28:18.736
You think they'd do
the same for you?

28:18.771 --> 28:19.851
I know they would.

28:19.886 --> 28:21.292
Oh, really?

28:21.294 --> 28:23.453
You really think
you can trust them?

28:23.488 --> 28:27.431
The FBI...
they're using you.

28:27.433 --> 28:29.233
You're just a map
for them to follow.

28:29.235 --> 28:30.701
You don't know what
you're talking about.

28:30.703 --> 28:32.290
I know your name's
not Jane.

28:32.325 --> 28:33.827
I know you don't know
what your tattoos mean

28:33.862 --> 28:36.065
or who gave them to you.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.186
And I know I'm not
the only prisoner

28:37.221 --> 28:39.060
on this little hike today.

28:39.862 --> 28:41.378
It's over, Guerrero.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.649
You can't talk your
way out of this one.

28:42.684 --> 28:45.282
Sooner or later, we all
face what we've done.

28:46.285 --> 28:47.384
Gah!

28:48.310 --> 28:49.577
Cover!

28:50.722 --> 28:51.889
Uhh!

29:09.111 --> 29:10.845
Wait a second.

29:10.847 --> 29:12.580
Look at this.

29:14.016 --> 29:15.661
We've been so focused
on the pencil marks,

29:15.696 --> 29:17.455
we weren't looking
at the rest of the page.

29:17.490 --> 29:20.121
Look.

29:20.123 --> 29:21.893
It's eraser marks.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.083
Yeah, they're faint
but you can see them.

29:24.118 --> 29:24.988
Do you know
what this means?

29:25.023 --> 29:26.434
That this... this
isn't the only code

29:26.469 --> 29:28.112
that's been
in this book.

29:28.147 --> 29:30.735
Exactly... just
the most recent one.

29:30.770 --> 29:34.202
Someone is using this
as a communication device.

29:34.204 --> 29:35.870
Like... like a shared
Google doc.

29:35.872 --> 29:37.829
Yes.
You read the message,

29:37.864 --> 29:39.641
erase it, and then
you write the reply.

29:39.676 --> 29:41.088
That's it.

29:47.116 --> 29:48.477
Listen.

29:48.512 --> 29:51.452
I...

29:51.454 --> 29:54.039
I've just been thinking
about it so, so much.

29:54.074 --> 29:56.278
And I don't
want you to freak out.

29:56.313 --> 30:00.695
But I think that you
should probably move in.

30:00.697 --> 30:03.649
I don't know, I feel like you
make some really solid points.

30:03.684 --> 30:04.580
- I do?
- Yeah.

30:04.615 --> 30:05.828
- Oh.
- Yeah.

30:05.863 --> 30:09.137
What the hell
is going on here?

30:10.707 --> 30:13.062
Uh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

30:13.097 --> 30:15.257
I...
How did you find me?

30:15.292 --> 30:17.411
I'm FBI, that's how.

30:17.413 --> 30:20.543
Who is he and what is he
doing with that photo?

30:31.193 --> 30:32.560
Let me see.

30:33.701 --> 30:36.531
I told you,
you care too much.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.962
How many of them
are out there?

30:38.997 --> 30:40.234
I wanna say
all of them.

30:40.236 --> 30:41.202
Gah!

30:49.467 --> 30:51.123
Uhh! Uhh!

30:53.049 --> 30:55.549
Weller and Zapata have
been out there a long time.

30:57.422 --> 30:59.411
- Aah!
- Reade! Reade!

30:59.446 --> 31:00.318
Are you all right?

31:00.353 --> 31:02.423
I'm good.
I'll live.

31:02.425 --> 31:03.958
He got me in the plates.

31:09.765 --> 31:11.452
They do know you're
in here, right?

31:11.487 --> 31:13.596
They're very enthusiastic.

31:15.045 --> 31:16.743
How do you feel about
holding down the fort?

31:16.778 --> 31:17.959
Jane, you can't
go back out there.

31:17.994 --> 31:20.408
I can run a flight, cut down
the guys with heavy guns.

31:20.410 --> 31:21.919
It's our only shot.

31:21.954 --> 31:23.658
If Weller and Zapata
aren't coming...

31:23.693 --> 31:25.580
They're coming.

31:25.582 --> 31:27.782
Jane!

31:27.784 --> 31:29.383
I got your cover.

31:35.705 --> 31:36.671
Uhh!

31:42.864 --> 31:44.398
Aah!

31:59.932 --> 32:00.932
Uhh!

32:06.855 --> 32:08.172
You okay?

32:08.207 --> 32:09.886
Yeah, you?

32:21.303 --> 32:23.061
Reade?

32:23.159 --> 32:24.305
Reade!

32:24.307 --> 32:25.506
Yeah?

32:25.508 --> 32:27.146
Guerrero alive?

32:27.232 --> 32:28.821
Well, damn, I thought you
were worried about me

32:28.856 --> 32:31.512
for a second, but yeah,
he's alive, we're coming out.

32:31.547 --> 32:33.281
Good.

32:36.118 --> 32:38.893
Drop all your guns
and give me Guerrero!

32:38.928 --> 32:40.718
We can't do that.

32:40.803 --> 32:43.157
I will kill her
right now!

32:43.192 --> 32:44.358
I don't have a shot.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.756
Neither do I.
Keep going out.

32:46.791 --> 32:48.844
Hand him over,
or she's gonna die!

32:48.879 --> 32:50.223
Just kill her already!

32:50.258 --> 32:52.392
Shut up.
You're not going anywhere.

32:52.427 --> 32:54.275
Your best option is
to drop that gun.

32:54.310 --> 32:55.078
No one else
needs to die.

32:55.113 --> 32:56.445
Oh!

32:58.573 --> 33:00.141
Come on.

33:02.339 --> 33:03.670
You need to get him
out of Draclyn.

33:03.705 --> 33:05.513
This isn't what
I pay you for!

33:05.515 --> 33:07.152
Too many of us
have died today.

33:07.187 --> 33:09.714
We're not your
militia anymore.

33:09.749 --> 33:11.585
You took
advantage of us.

33:11.587 --> 33:14.822
You were either with him
or against him.

33:14.824 --> 33:16.991
Well, we're not
with you anymore.

33:16.993 --> 33:19.560
You understand this is
all over for you, Sheriff.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.149
This place is about to
be swarmed with FBI.

33:22.964 --> 33:24.699
I know.

33:24.701 --> 33:26.434
But more men are
on their way.

33:26.436 --> 33:27.852
I'll hold them off
as best I can.

33:27.887 --> 33:29.202
You have to leave now.

33:29.237 --> 33:30.820
Like we haven't been
trying to do that all day?

33:30.855 --> 33:32.677
We haven't tried
the helicopter.

33:50.425 --> 33:52.693
- Give me the gun.
- Take it.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.566
I... I don't know what to do.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.340
Come on, you got us this far.
Why else would it be here?

34:04.375 --> 34:06.073
I don't know.
I don't know.

34:06.075 --> 34:08.641
They're getting closer.
They're getting closer.

34:08.643 --> 34:09.976
Come on, Jane.

34:09.978 --> 34:12.279
If you can fly this thing,
take off, now.

34:23.382 --> 34:24.658
Go!

35:01.782 --> 35:04.818
When we were separated
in the woods, I...

35:04.820 --> 35:06.586
I kept thinking
about you...

35:06.588 --> 35:09.923
and me
and Taylor Shaw.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.327
We're in this together.

35:18.766 --> 35:21.885
How can you fly a chopper
out of a combat zone...

35:21.920 --> 35:25.005
and still be scared
of a little turbulence?

35:25.007 --> 35:28.041
I think it's got something
to do with being in control.

35:32.246 --> 35:34.188
Do you have any idea

35:34.223 --> 35:37.584
how dangerous
your actions were?

35:37.586 --> 35:41.154
Those tattoos are not some
Sunday morning crossword puzzle.

35:41.156 --> 35:43.990
They contain
extremely sensitive,

35:43.992 --> 35:45.959
classified intelligence,

35:45.961 --> 35:50.247
all of which have led us
to volatile criminal activity.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.612
You put the case,
yourself,

35:52.647 --> 35:54.701
and a civilian
at great risk.

35:54.703 --> 35:56.236
I know, I...

35:56.238 --> 35:58.338
we were just trying
to solve the...

36:01.976 --> 36:04.044
I screwed up.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.812
I'm so sorry.

36:08.215 --> 36:09.447
Is David in trouble?

36:09.482 --> 36:10.786
He's in holding.

36:10.821 --> 36:13.701
I had to vet him to assess
his threat level.

36:13.736 --> 36:15.580
- He's not a threat.
- That's not

36:15.615 --> 36:17.557
for you to decide.

36:19.964 --> 36:21.575
Oh, my God.

36:25.766 --> 36:28.268
Am I about to be fired?

36:34.141 --> 36:36.810
Everyone gets
one mistake.

36:36.812 --> 36:37.844
One.

36:37.846 --> 36:40.146
This one is yours.

36:48.622 --> 36:50.457
Yeah!

37:05.439 --> 37:07.240
It's really him.

37:07.242 --> 37:08.908
I want you to
go in there.

37:08.910 --> 37:10.410
Why me?

37:10.412 --> 37:12.112
You have
the relationship.

37:12.114 --> 37:13.847
He went dark on me
for a reason.

37:13.849 --> 37:16.349
We have a lot
of bad blood.

37:16.351 --> 37:17.660
I just pulled him out
from under a rock

37:17.695 --> 37:19.285
and dragged him
through hell.

37:19.287 --> 37:20.787
That is bad blood.

37:20.789 --> 37:23.188
Trust me,
I know Guerrero.

37:23.223 --> 37:25.792
I'm the last person
he wants to see right now.

37:25.794 --> 37:27.848
He'll either start
playing games or shut down,

37:27.883 --> 37:30.818
and we'll lose our chance
to get the information.

37:30.853 --> 37:33.764
You were his handler.
It has to be you.

37:43.715 --> 37:45.220
I am so sorry.

37:45.255 --> 37:47.511
They didn't
fire you, did they?

37:47.546 --> 37:49.864
No, no.
Close, but... no.

37:49.899 --> 37:50.983
You were right, okay?
I just...

37:51.018 --> 37:52.342
I got caught
up ieverything.

37:52.377 --> 37:54.220
No, me too.
Me too.

37:54.222 --> 37:57.261
Can I...
am I under arrest?

37:57.296 --> 38:00.262
No.
No, you're free to go.

38:00.356 --> 38:02.102
Well...

38:02.137 --> 38:03.366
I think it's time
we open that Blanton's

38:03.401 --> 38:05.765
your uncle gave you.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.633
I...
I can't do this.

38:11.668 --> 38:12.632
You...

38:12.695 --> 38:14.559
I know you're different.

38:14.598 --> 38:17.643
Um, but I'm
still the same.

38:19.980 --> 38:23.817
And I'm the reason
that they move out.

38:23.819 --> 38:29.622
And this job...
I love this job.

38:29.624 --> 38:31.825
But it takes all of me.

38:31.827 --> 38:34.654
And I can't be...

38:34.689 --> 38:36.244
Happy?

38:39.716 --> 38:41.524
Distracted.

38:48.442 --> 38:52.674
Well, I'll, uh...
I'll leave you to it.

39:06.307 --> 39:09.058
<i>Did you really think
we wouldn't find you?</i>

39:11.498 --> 39:14.943
Why don't you catch me up
on the last two years?

39:14.978 --> 39:17.549
Who tipped you off
about the indictment?

39:21.575 --> 39:23.243
All right.

39:23.245 --> 39:26.317
Who knew you were
in Draclyn?

39:26.352 --> 39:29.382
Someone outside of
the township had to know.

39:29.384 --> 39:31.351
Why would I talk to you?

39:31.353 --> 39:35.898
Because I'm an assistant
director at the FBI now, Saul.

39:35.933 --> 39:38.808
I'm your only
shot at a deal.

39:41.762 --> 39:43.129
Murder.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.565
Conspiracy
to commit murder.

39:45.567 --> 39:48.610
Conspiracy
to commit extortion.

39:48.645 --> 39:50.891
<i>Narcotics distribution.</i>

39:50.968 --> 39:52.525
Tell me what
I want to know,

39:52.560 --> 39:55.341
and I'll talk to
the federal prosecutor.

40:00.281 --> 40:04.995
<i>I'm a lot of things.
But I'm not a rat.</i>

40:06.163 --> 40:08.087
I have nothing to say.

40:09.924 --> 40:13.010
We've waited this long.

40:13.114 --> 40:15.431
<i>We can wait
a little longer.</i>

40:27.474 --> 40:29.609
That wasn't the reunion
I was expecting.

40:29.611 --> 40:30.830
Guerrero's
always been stubborn.

40:30.865 --> 40:33.287
If he doesn't wanna talk,
I can't make him talk.

40:33.322 --> 40:35.452
Guerrero's been running
his mouth off all day,

40:35.487 --> 40:36.461
dissecting my team,

40:36.496 --> 40:38.220
looking for any
weakness to exploit,

40:38.255 --> 40:39.886
and twisting anything
that he learned

40:39.888 --> 40:41.120
to get an advantage.

40:41.155 --> 40:43.027
He didn't have a move
for you in there.

40:43.062 --> 40:46.326
He's out of moves.
He knows it's over.

40:46.328 --> 40:47.662
When you walked in there,
there wasn't even

40:47.697 --> 40:49.830
a flicker of
recognition from Guerrero.

40:49.865 --> 40:51.864
And you walked out without
even trying to crack him.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.000
- Listen to me...
- No, you listen to me.

40:54.002 --> 40:56.135
He says that
he isn't a rat.

40:56.137 --> 40:57.403
I believe him.

40:57.405 --> 40:59.605
You were never
his handler, were you?

40:59.607 --> 41:01.641
You've never even
met him before.

41:01.643 --> 41:04.146
- Kurt...
- What the hell is going on?

41:04.181 --> 41:07.280
Why is that case
on her body?

41:07.282 --> 41:09.115
Tell me the truth.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.981
Only three people
in the world know

41:19.016 --> 41:22.295
what I'm about
to tell you.

41:22.297 --> 41:23.959
The truth...

41:26.024 --> 41:28.602
...it's called Daylight.
