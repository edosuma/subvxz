00:09.927 --> 00:11.883
- Good morning, Commander.
- Data.

00:13.287 --> 00:16.597
- Interesting night?
- I found it extremely interesting.

00:16.687 --> 00:19.918
The lateral sensor arrays
ran three spectral analyses

00:20.007 --> 00:22.521
on the Alawanir Nebula
on three frequencies.

00:22.607 --> 00:26.395
- I'm sorry I missed it.
- I will send you the report.

00:26.487 --> 00:29.320
We are still on course
for the Gariman Sector.

00:29.407 --> 00:31.875
Our speed is warp six.
ETA, 1300 hours.

00:31.967 --> 00:36.882
Sickbay reported one minor injury
in exobiology at 0420 hours.

00:36.967 --> 00:40.926
Very well. Isn't Lt Worf scheduled
to replace Ensign Torigan?

00:41.007 --> 00:44.795
Yes, sir. I was not informed
of any change to the roster.

00:44.887 --> 00:47.879
He's never late. Riker to Lt Worf.

00:50.927 --> 00:52.918
Computer, locate Lt Worf.

00:53.007 --> 00:55.282
Lt Worf is in his quarters.

00:56.087 --> 00:58.999
Something's wrong.
Mr. Data, you have the bridge.

00:59.087 --> 01:02.318
Security team, deck seven,
section 25 Baker.

01:02.407 --> 01:03.965
Aye, sir.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.767 --> 01:17.201
Computer, override
security lock on this door.

01:17.287 --> 01:19.676
Authorization, Riker Alpha six zero.

01:36.887 --> 01:39.765
Worf, what the hell are you doing?

02:11.167 --> 02:14.204
Space, the final frontier.

02:15.687 --> 02:19.043
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:19.687 --> 02:23.726
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

02:24.767 --> 02:28.157
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

02:29.167 --> 02:32.716
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

03:30.527 --> 03:32.085
Enter!

03:44.007 --> 03:45.725
Captain.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.406
On your feet, Lieutenant.

03:53.127 --> 03:54.116
Sir.

03:54.207 --> 03:57.324
Mr. Worf, your personal affairs
are your concern

03:57.407 --> 04:01.082
until they interfere with this ship.
You have crossed that line.

04:02.007 --> 04:05.204
As Captain,
I want to know what is going on.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.324
- It is difficult to explain.
- Try.

04:09.727 --> 04:14.118
Ever since I returned from the
Carraya System, I have felt empty.

04:15.527 --> 04:19.519
Is this to do with the Klingons
you rescued from Carraya IV?

04:20.647 --> 04:24.720
They were young.
They knew nothing of their heritage.

04:24.807 --> 04:27.560
While I was there,
I tried to teach them

04:27.647 --> 04:30.445
about their people, their culture.

04:31.367 --> 04:33.927
I told them our ancient stories,

04:34.007 --> 04:37.443
instructed them in our customs,
explained our beliefs.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.757
Then I told them about Kahless,

04:39.847 --> 04:42.486
how he had united our people
long ago,

04:42.567 --> 04:44.922
how he gave us strength and honour

04:45.007 --> 04:48.556
and how he promised to return
one day and lead us again.

04:55.727 --> 05:00.243
Is that what you're doing here?
Trying to recapture those feelings?

05:00.327 --> 05:03.637
Yes. I was trying to summon
a vision of Kahless.

05:04.167 --> 05:07.682
Better to use the holodeck
than setting fire to your quarters.

05:07.767 --> 05:10.520
Using the holodeck
would not be appropriate.

05:10.607 --> 05:13.997
Everything had to be real
if Kahless were to appear.

05:15.527 --> 05:18.519
But all this is for nothing.

05:19.767 --> 05:21.883
He did not come to me.

05:25.087 --> 05:28.443
I gave Toq and the others
a belief in Sto-Vo-Kor,

05:28.527 --> 05:32.486
the life beyond this life
where Kahless awaits us.

05:32.567 --> 05:38.722
When I saw the power of their
beliefs, I began to question my own.

05:38.807 --> 05:41.719
And I found it wanting.

05:43.567 --> 05:46.877
Have you lost your faith
in Sto-Vo-Kor?

05:46.967 --> 05:50.118
To lose something,
one must first possess it.

05:50.207 --> 05:53.438
I am not sure
I ever had a true belief.

05:59.167 --> 06:01.806
But it should not have interfered
with my duties.

06:01.887 --> 06:03.957
- My behaviour was...
- Inexcusable.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.159
And understandable.

06:07.607 --> 06:11.486
It may be that what you are looking
for cannot be found here.

06:12.727 --> 06:17.323
Perhaps you need to immerse yourself
in Klingon beliefs

06:17.927 --> 06:22.159
in order to discover
if they can hold any truth for you.

06:22.767 --> 06:26.885
Is there something you could do,
somewhere you could go,

06:26.967 --> 06:29.481
to explore your faith more fully?

06:32.327 --> 06:36.525
Boreth. The followers of Kahless
await his return there.

06:36.607 --> 06:39.167
To Klingons,
there is no more sacred place.

06:40.287 --> 06:44.280
Boreth is only 12 days
from here by shuttle.

06:46.287 --> 06:49.279
As of this moment,
you are on leave.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.641
Thank you, sir.

06:50.967 --> 06:55.040
But when you set foot
on this ship again,

06:55.127 --> 06:58.915
I expect you to perform your duties
like a Starfleet officer.

06:59.007 --> 07:00.440
Yes, sir.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.205
And, Mr. Worf?

07:08.367 --> 07:11.245
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

07:11.327 --> 07:12.965
Thank you, sir.

07:52.647 --> 07:55.036
Kahless. I see Kahless.

07:55.447 --> 07:58.564
He is standing before me,
with a sword.

07:59.007 --> 08:00.406
He wants something.

08:01.727 --> 08:02.876
Me.

08:04.087 --> 08:05.839
He wants me.

08:05.927 --> 08:08.202
He wants me to go with him.

08:10.487 --> 08:12.796
It is a powerful vision, Divok.

08:13.687 --> 08:16.759
Kahless wants you to join him
in Sto-Vo-Kor.

08:16.847 --> 08:21.921
You are only 19, yet your place
among the honoured dead is secure.

08:22.007 --> 08:25.283
Take him back to his chamber.
Let him sleep.

08:38.607 --> 08:40.756
You're leaving us?

08:42.167 --> 08:44.476
It has been ten days, Koroth.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.957
I have had no visions.
I have received no insight.

08:48.047 --> 08:49.958
There is nothing here for me.

08:52.007 --> 08:55.522
What is
the Story of the Promise, Worf?

08:58.847 --> 09:02.999
When Kahless had united our people
and gave them the laws of honour,

09:03.087 --> 09:04.918
he saw that his work was done.

09:05.007 --> 09:09.046
One night, he gathered his belongings
and said goodbye.

09:09.127 --> 09:12.403
The people wept.
They did not want him to go.

09:15.967 --> 09:18.720
Then Kahless said,
"You are Klingons."

09:18.807 --> 09:21.719
"You need no one but yourselves."

09:21.807 --> 09:26.927
"I will go now to Sto-Vo-Kor,
but I promise one day I will return."

09:27.847 --> 09:31.476
Then Kahless pointed
to a star in the sky

09:31.567 --> 09:37.358
and said, "Look for me there,
on that point of light."

09:37.447 --> 09:44.159
So, here we are, on a world
circling that distant point of light.

09:46.327 --> 09:49.603
It has been 15 centuries
since he made that promise,

09:49.687 --> 09:51.279
and still we wait.

09:53.247 --> 09:57.763
What are ten days in the life
of one Klingon compared to that?

09:57.847 --> 10:01.886
Is the son of Mogh
really so easily discouraged?

10:03.207 --> 10:05.243
You came to us seeking answers,

10:05.367 --> 10:08.484
but this is a place of questions.

10:09.927 --> 10:12.316
Open your heart to Kahless.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.402
Ask him your questions.

10:15.967 --> 10:20.358
Let him speak to you with your mind
unclouded by doubt or hesitation.

10:20.447 --> 10:24.201
Only then can you find
what you are looking for.

10:24.287 --> 10:27.006
If you cannot do that,

10:27.087 --> 10:30.875
then perhaps you should return
to your starship.

11:04.927 --> 11:06.599
I see Kahless.

11:31.687 --> 11:33.086
You are real.

11:37.527 --> 11:39.677
I am Kahless.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.637
And I have returned.

12:02.167 --> 12:03.600
What are you doing?

12:07.567 --> 12:10.400
- Who are you?
- It is Kahless.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.842
I have returned.

12:19.247 --> 12:20.839
You doubt me.

12:22.607 --> 12:26.236
Who here knows the story
of how this sword was forged?

12:26.967 --> 12:30.118
No one knows. It is not written
in the sacred texts.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.199
I went into the mountains,

12:36.287 --> 12:39.916
all the way
to the volcano at Kri'stak.

12:40.007 --> 12:42.965
There I cut off a lock of my hair

12:43.047 --> 12:47.837
and thrust it into the molten rock
that poured from the summit.

12:47.927 --> 12:50.600
The hair began to burn.

12:50.687 --> 12:54.396
Then I plunged it
into the Lake of Lusor,

12:54.487 --> 12:57.399
and twisted it into this sword.

12:58.847 --> 13:04.683
And after I used it to kill Molor,
I gave it a name.

13:05.847 --> 13:07.678
Bat'leth.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.962
The sword of honour.

13:10.847 --> 13:12.599
You know!

13:13.287 --> 13:16.836
The story of the sword
is known only to the high clerics.

13:16.927 --> 13:20.203
It was never written down,
so that if he returned,

13:20.287 --> 13:23.802
we could be sure it was Kahless.

13:23.887 --> 13:28.199
I have returned because there is
a great need in my people.

13:28.287 --> 13:31.882
They fight amongst themselves
in petty wars

13:31.967 --> 13:35.198
that corrupt the glory
of the Klingon spirit.

13:35.287 --> 13:37.801
They have lost their way.

13:37.887 --> 13:39.764
But it is not too late.

13:40.367 --> 13:46.283
I have returned
and I will lead my people again.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.236
Kahless.

13:55.647 --> 13:57.205
Kahless.

14:08.487 --> 14:10.443
What is it you are doing?

14:13.647 --> 14:15.365
I was getting my tricorder.

14:16.527 --> 14:19.041
Tricorder? Is it a weapon?

14:19.127 --> 14:22.244
No. It is a tool.

14:22.967 --> 14:27.006
- I intended to use it...
- To see if I was real.

14:28.607 --> 14:32.236
Proceed. Use your tricorder.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.116
Well?

14:46.847 --> 14:48.439
You are Klingon.

14:49.127 --> 14:51.277
What else could I be?

14:51.367 --> 14:54.757
There are many possibilities.
A shape shifter.

14:54.847 --> 14:58.442
- A holographic projection.
- You are a sceptic, Worf.

14:58.527 --> 15:00.245
I like that.

15:01.407 --> 15:06.356
- How do you know my name?
- We have met before.

15:06.447 --> 15:10.360
I appeared to you in a vision
in the caves of No'Mat.

15:10.447 --> 15:12.881
You were just a child then.

15:12.967 --> 15:15.845
I told you
that you would do something

15:15.927 --> 15:19.476
that no Klingon had ever done before.

15:21.167 --> 15:24.955
You still do not believe it is me,
do you, Worf?

15:27.007 --> 15:28.725
I want to believe.

15:32.607 --> 15:34.518
That is a beginning.

15:49.567 --> 15:53.526
Gowron is the leader of the Council
and the defence force.

15:53.607 --> 15:56.405
- If he opposes you...
- Do not worry.

15:56.487 --> 15:59.638
We are on the threshold of a new era.

15:59.727 --> 16:03.322
Klingons from all over the Empire
will flock to my banner.

16:05.367 --> 16:12.443
Yet something still weighs heavy
on the brow of the son of Mogh.

16:12.527 --> 16:15.758
Are you contemplating
yet another question for me?

16:16.887 --> 16:21.836
After three days, I wonder
if you know how to do anything else.

16:21.927 --> 16:26.000
Questions are the beginning of
wisdom, the mark of a true warrior.

16:26.087 --> 16:31.320
Do not forget that a leader need not
answer questions of those he leads.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.638
It is enough that he says
to do a thing and they will do it.

16:34.727 --> 16:38.925
If he says to run, they run.
If he says to fight, they fight.

16:39.007 --> 16:42.966
If he says to die, they die.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.323
If the commander is worthy of trust.

17:44.007 --> 17:45.679
What is wrong?

17:47.047 --> 17:51.757
Is there only anger and bloodlust
in your souls?

17:51.847 --> 17:55.635
Is that all that is left
in the Klingon heart?

17:56.407 --> 17:59.922
We do not fight
merely to spill blood,

18:00.007 --> 18:02.282
but to enrich the spirit.

18:03.047 --> 18:09.600
Look at us. Two warriors locked
in battle, fighting for honour.

18:10.767 --> 18:14.282
How can you not sing
for all to hear?

18:14.367 --> 18:16.835
We are Klingons!

18:20.887 --> 18:21.922
Yes.

18:22.007 --> 18:26.285
Let it out.
Let the joy in your heart be heard.

18:26.367 --> 18:28.801
We are Klingons!

18:29.647 --> 18:31.399
We are Klingons.

18:32.607 --> 18:36.236
We are Klingons.

18:49.687 --> 18:53.123
Captain's log, stardate 46852.2.

18:53.207 --> 18:55.801
The Enterprise
is to proceed to Boreth

18:55.887 --> 18:58.720
to take aboard
a very unusual guest.

18:59.487 --> 19:02.604
Did you take
any other tricorder readings,

19:02.687 --> 19:06.157
an anatomical profile
or a neurophysiology scan?

19:06.247 --> 19:07.282
No.

19:07.367 --> 19:10.996
It's going to be difficult
to eliminate possibilities now.

19:11.087 --> 19:14.159
He may be a coalescent being
taking Klingon form,

19:14.247 --> 19:18.957
or a bioreplicant or a Klingon
who has been surgically altered.

19:19.047 --> 19:21.038
There is another possibility.

19:23.607 --> 19:27.566
He could be the real Kahless.
He may have returned as he promised.

19:27.647 --> 19:32.641
The appearance of Kahless
is consistent with the sacred texts.

19:32.727 --> 19:34.479
Worf, no offence,

19:34.567 --> 19:39.277
but I have trouble believing the man
on deck eight is supernatural.

19:39.927 --> 19:42.077
I did not say that he is.

19:42.167 --> 19:45.716
I merely think that we should not
reject the possibility.

19:45.807 --> 19:49.163
Look, we have no reason
to rule out anything.

19:49.247 --> 19:53.001
We are not ordered to investigate
the origins of our guest,

19:53.087 --> 19:55.237
nor to tell anyone what to believe.

19:55.327 --> 19:59.002
We are simply to transport him
to the Homeworld.

19:59.087 --> 20:01.157
And while he's here with us,

20:01.247 --> 20:04.205
he will be treated
as an honoured guest.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.835
Lieutenant?

20:12.087 --> 20:14.157
May I ask a question?

20:14.247 --> 20:16.283
In the absence of empirical data,

20:16.367 --> 20:19.006
how will you determine if he is real?

20:19.087 --> 20:23.717
It is not an empirical matter.
It is a matter of faith.

20:24.647 --> 20:30.040
Faith? Then you do believe
Kahless has supernatural attributes?

20:30.727 --> 20:32.206
As an android,

20:32.287 --> 20:35.916
I am unable to accept
that which cannot be proven.

20:36.007 --> 20:38.362
I would appreciate
hearing your insights.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.961
Perhaps some other time, Commander.

20:41.887 --> 20:47.962
I do not believe I can provide
much insight at this moment.

21:04.887 --> 21:08.197
- Welcome aboard, Gowron.
- Where is he, Picard?

21:09.247 --> 21:11.397
I assume
you are referring to Kahless.

21:11.487 --> 21:15.366
I am referring to the filthy pahtk
who is using his name.

21:15.447 --> 21:21.158
Well, the person in question
is in his quarters at the moment.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.919
What have you learned?

21:23.007 --> 21:26.920
What medical analysis have you made?
Any theories about his origin?

21:27.007 --> 21:30.716
- We haven't done any analysis.
- What fools work for you?

21:30.807 --> 21:33.116
The impostor has been aboard
for a day.

21:33.207 --> 21:36.517
If you wanted tests,
you should have sent a ship.

21:36.607 --> 21:40.964
And have him spread his lies
through a ship of Klingons? Never.

21:41.047 --> 21:43.561
If he really is an impostor,
don't worry.

21:43.647 --> 21:46.002
Kahless has been dead
for 1,000 years.

21:46.087 --> 21:50.319
But the idea of Kahless is alive.
Have you ever fought an idea?

21:50.407 --> 21:53.240
It has no weapon to destroy,
no body to kill.

21:53.327 --> 21:57.206
The idea of Kahless's return
must be stopped here

21:57.287 --> 22:00.359
or it will travel
through the Empire like a wave,

22:00.447 --> 22:03.962
and leave nothing
but destruction behind.

22:11.287 --> 22:14.723
So Gowron has come on board
to test your claim.

22:14.807 --> 22:17.082
Gowron knows
that his days are over.

22:17.167 --> 22:19.635
He comes crawling aboard
with some test.

22:19.727 --> 22:23.276
- We don't have to prove anything.
- What test?

22:23.367 --> 22:24.800
He has a knife,

22:24.887 --> 22:28.277
a knife that is stained
with the blood of Kahless.

22:28.367 --> 22:30.164
Gowron has the Knife of Kirom?

22:30.247 --> 22:32.966
No one should remove it
from the sacred vault.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.515
Gowron does not care
what is sacred.

22:35.607 --> 22:40.203
He wants to run a genetic analysis
on the blood and on you.

22:40.287 --> 22:43.245
That should tell us
if there is a match.

22:43.327 --> 22:49.960
If you agree, I will ensure
that it is conducted impartially.

22:50.687 --> 22:53.645
Perhaps it is time
to settle the doubts

22:53.727 --> 22:56.321
of those who still do not believe.

22:58.007 --> 23:00.362
I will allow this test.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.724
There, that should do it.

23:08.567 --> 23:13.038
Computer, run a genetic comparison
on this blood sample

23:13.127 --> 23:15.641
and the tissue belonging to Kahless.

23:17.287 --> 23:19.437
The genetic patterns are identical.

23:20.967 --> 23:24.198
But how? How can this be?

23:27.047 --> 23:28.844
It is true.

23:31.647 --> 23:33.842
Kahless has returned.

23:44.167 --> 23:48.638
I am sorry. Our replicator
does not do justice to warnog.

23:54.927 --> 23:58.966
It's been so long since
I have tasted any food or drink.

24:00.367 --> 24:03.086
There are many things
I have forgotten.

24:06.287 --> 24:07.879
Kahless.

24:09.847 --> 24:16.002
May I ask you about death
and Sto-Vo-Kor?

24:17.047 --> 24:20.881
Tell me, what awaits us
beyond this life?

24:22.727 --> 24:25.446
I do not have those answers.

24:25.527 --> 24:27.643
I am merely a traveller

24:27.727 --> 24:31.402
who has journeyed back and forth
between this world and the next.

24:31.487 --> 24:36.083
While I am in this form,
I know only about this world.

24:38.367 --> 24:42.246
And there is much work
for me to do in this world.

24:42.327 --> 24:44.966
And you will be part of it, Worf.

24:45.447 --> 24:46.436
Me?

24:46.527 --> 24:50.759
It was your purity of heart that
summoned me back from Sto-Vo-Kor.

24:50.847 --> 24:53.680
Koroth has told me
about the respect you've earned

24:53.767 --> 24:55.883
in the Federation and the Empire.

24:55.967 --> 25:01.837
I want you at my side
as we restore honour to our people.

25:04.047 --> 25:08.723
Let me tell you about
this new empire we will forge.

25:12.207 --> 25:15.563
- It will be glorious!
- It will be war!

25:15.647 --> 25:16.636
No.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.523
You are not a fool.

25:20.607 --> 25:25.442
Do you really think that every
Klingon will grovel before this man,

25:25.527 --> 25:28.644
just because Koroth
says he is Kahless?

25:29.007 --> 25:30.804
He is Kahless.

25:32.607 --> 25:34.359
Your own test proved it.

25:34.447 --> 25:38.725
I will not hand over the Empire
to Koroth because of one test.

25:38.807 --> 25:42.083
- This is not Koroth.
- Of course it is!

25:42.167 --> 25:43.646
Open your eyes.

25:43.727 --> 25:47.845
Koroth and the other guardians
have always opposed me.

25:47.927 --> 25:52.045
This is nothing more than a ploy
to seize power.

25:52.127 --> 25:57.281
Even now, there are warriors on my
own ship who want to see Kahless.

25:57.367 --> 26:00.404
There are others who believe
he is an impostor.

26:00.487 --> 26:02.921
The divisions are already forming.

26:03.007 --> 26:05.885
But it does not have to be this way.

26:05.967 --> 26:10.483
We could join together and welcome
Kahless as a united people.

26:10.567 --> 26:15.561
Don't you see? This is exactly
why they want you to join them.

26:15.647 --> 26:18.605
Because your brother
sits on the Council,

26:18.687 --> 26:22.475
and your voice carries weight
in the Empire.

26:22.567 --> 26:25.843
They want you
to influence others to follow them.

26:25.927 --> 26:27.155
Worf.

26:27.727 --> 26:30.878
We fought together once,
side by side,

26:30.967 --> 26:33.720
to keep the Empire
from being torn apart.

26:33.807 --> 26:37.004
Will you stand by
and let these impostors

26:37.087 --> 26:40.762
destroy all that we fought
so hard to protect?

26:44.727 --> 26:46.843
Renounce him, Worf.

26:46.927 --> 26:53.275
Stand with me
and we can hold the Empire together.

26:56.567 --> 26:59.923
You do not understand.
Kahless is our future.

27:00.007 --> 27:04.762
Only with his help can we revive
the pure warriors within ourselves.

27:05.487 --> 27:09.321
Listen to him, Gowron.
Open your heart. Hear his words.

27:09.407 --> 27:13.685
He will restore your faith
as he has restored mine.

27:14.287 --> 27:18.166
Give him a chance
to lift your spirit

27:18.247 --> 27:21.478
and cleanse your heart
before you take up arms.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.806
Koroth.

27:37.287 --> 27:40.245
I see that not all fools die young.

27:41.527 --> 27:42.755
Kahless.

27:48.047 --> 27:52.006
Kahless, may I present Gowron,
leader of the High Council?

27:52.807 --> 27:54.638
Kahless.

27:59.727 --> 28:05.245
Long ago, a storm was heading
toward the city of Quin'lat.

28:05.327 --> 28:08.205
The people sought protection
within the walls.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.642
All except one man
who remained outside.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.920
I went and asked what he was doing.

28:14.567 --> 28:17.035
"I am not afraid," he said.

28:17.127 --> 28:21.484
"I will not hide my face
behind stone and mortar."

28:21.567 --> 28:26.322
"I will stand before the wind
and make it respect me."

28:27.087 --> 28:29.555
I honoured his choice
and went inside.

28:30.167 --> 28:35.036
The next day, the storm came
and the man was killed.

28:35.967 --> 28:39.562
The wind does not respect a fool.

28:41.247 --> 28:44.762
Do not stand before the wind,
Gowron.

28:46.487 --> 28:48.239
What was his name?

28:51.007 --> 28:52.042
What?

28:52.127 --> 28:54.357
If you were really there,

28:54.447 --> 28:58.884
you should be able to tell us the
name of the man outside the walls.

28:58.967 --> 29:01.606
Describe him to us.

29:01.687 --> 29:06.283
What was he wearing? How tall was he?

29:06.367 --> 29:10.918
- What colour were his eyes?
- I do not remember.

29:11.527 --> 29:14.917
It was long ago
and in another lifetime.

29:15.007 --> 29:20.684
What matters is, I have returned to
restore faith and hope to my people,

29:20.767 --> 29:24.123
to lead them back
to the way of honour,

29:24.207 --> 29:28.439
and the glory that once was theirs
and can be again.

29:28.527 --> 29:33.282
- Is that what you oppose, Gowron?
- I oppose you.

29:33.367 --> 29:35.676
I say you are not Kahless.

29:36.647 --> 29:39.844
And I will not bend my knee to you

29:40.487 --> 29:45.561
as long as I can draw breath
or pick up a blade.

29:55.647 --> 29:56.762
- No.
- Koroth.

30:09.607 --> 30:12.724
A good try, Gowron. But not enough.

30:25.447 --> 30:28.007
You have no joy, Gowron.

30:28.087 --> 30:30.476
Is your heart so full of suspicion

30:30.567 --> 30:33.604
that you've forgotten
what it means to be Klingon?

30:43.087 --> 30:47.478
Kahless.
The greatest warrior of them all!

31:00.047 --> 31:01.924
Everything will be alright.

31:02.007 --> 31:06.080
We will say that Gowron used
a dishonourable tactic.

31:06.167 --> 31:08.203
- He cheated.
- That is a lie!

31:08.287 --> 31:12.519
We do not need to hear from you.
You brought them together!

31:12.607 --> 31:15.644
I am Kahless,
the strongest, bravest warrior.

31:15.727 --> 31:19.925
Do not think about what happened.
You must think of the future.

31:20.007 --> 31:24.603
There is no future here.
No glorious new era for our people.

31:25.207 --> 31:26.799
Gowron was right.

31:26.887 --> 31:30.004
You did not know the name of the man
who faced the storm.

31:30.087 --> 31:32.647
You do not know
what real warnog tastes like.

31:32.727 --> 31:35.446
And you certainly
are not the greatest warrior.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.597
Whoever you are, you are not Kahless.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.803
You have said enough. Get out!

31:39.887 --> 31:44.517
You are using the name of Kahless
for some twisted game.

31:44.607 --> 31:46.757
For that alone, you should die.

31:46.847 --> 31:51.079
If you do not tell me what you have
done, I will kill you right here!

31:53.887 --> 31:56.401
The problems with your memory

31:56.487 --> 31:58.921
are the result
of the way you returned.

32:00.287 --> 32:01.766
What do you mean?

32:01.847 --> 32:05.886
We, the guardians, have been
awaiting your return for centuries,

32:05.967 --> 32:10.677
but we did not have the technology
to bring you back. Until now.

32:10.767 --> 32:16.160
We used an organic sample of
the first Kahless to give you life.

32:16.247 --> 32:18.158
The first Kahless?

32:18.247 --> 32:20.602
A clone.

32:24.807 --> 32:27.196
He is a clone.

32:27.287 --> 32:29.881
What is a clone?

32:29.967 --> 32:31.958
A being created in a laboratory

32:32.047 --> 32:34.766
by using genetic material
from another being.

32:34.847 --> 32:39.602
- You are a copy. A fraud!
- You are not just a copy.

32:39.687 --> 32:42.645
We gave you more
than the body of Kahless.

32:42.727 --> 32:46.766
We found a way to imprint information
in your neurosynaptic patterns.

32:46.847 --> 32:48.963
We gave you memories,
not any memories.

32:49.047 --> 32:53.757
We gave you the experiences of
Kahless, as written in sacred texts.

32:54.407 --> 32:59.959
So, I did not do any of the things
that I remember.

33:00.807 --> 33:03.480
I was never in the city of Quin'lat.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.922
I never went
to the Kri'stat volcano.

33:06.007 --> 33:08.646
You were not awakened
until we transported you

33:08.727 --> 33:10.922
into the cave
and you appeared to Worf.

33:11.007 --> 33:14.841
Before then, you were in a laboratory
where we accelerated growth,

33:14.927 --> 33:17.361
corrected any genetic anomalies,

33:17.447 --> 33:19.756
gave you the wisdom and memories...

33:23.807 --> 33:28.676
They grew you in a test tube
like some kind of fungus.

33:28.767 --> 33:30.803
And programmed you like a machine.

33:30.887 --> 33:35.165
- You are twisting the truth.
- You talk to me of truth?

33:35.247 --> 33:38.478
You who brought to life this lie
and called it Kahless.

33:38.567 --> 33:42.003
It is not a lie.
Genetically, he is Kahless.

33:42.367 --> 33:44.676
And he is needed by our people.

33:44.767 --> 33:48.282
You know that corruption and
dishonour are destroying the Empire.

33:48.367 --> 33:51.518
- They need him.
- They do not need a false god.

33:51.607 --> 33:54.679
How do you know
this is not the prophecy?

33:54.767 --> 33:57.600
Who is to say
that what we did was wrong?

33:57.687 --> 34:01.396
I am.
I will not let this fraud continue.

34:02.647 --> 34:03.682
Worf.

34:06.607 --> 34:08.120
You cannot tell Gowron.

34:08.806 --> 34:10.797
Do not give me orders.

34:11.847 --> 34:14.315
Alright. But consider this.

34:14.407 --> 34:19.275
If you tell Gowron what we have
told you, it will destroy him.

34:19.847 --> 34:24.841
And with him, the last chance
to restore hope to our people.

34:25.887 --> 34:27.922
It's your choice.

34:48.647 --> 34:52.925
They have been sitting here
for three hours, 17 minutes.

34:53.007 --> 34:56.716
They refuse to return
with the rest of Gowron's men.

34:56.806 --> 35:00.641
They insisted upon waiting here
until they see Kahless again.

35:00.727 --> 35:06.120
Their faith is unaffected
by his inability to defeat Gowron.

35:06.207 --> 35:07.925
They still believe.

35:10.087 --> 35:11.520
Then they are fools.

35:11.607 --> 35:14.758
Does that mean
you no longer believe it is Kahless?

35:14.847 --> 35:18.556
- Yes.
- I am curious.

35:18.647 --> 35:21.798
Do you still think
the real Kahless will return?

35:21.887 --> 35:26.358
Or has this experience
only deepened your spiritual crisis?

35:32.007 --> 35:35.397
- I do not know.
- I understand your dilemma.

35:35.487 --> 35:39.400
I once had what could be considered
a crisis of the spirit.

35:39.487 --> 35:40.886
You?

35:40.967 --> 35:45.563
Yes. The Starfleet officers
who activated me on Omicron Theta

35:45.647 --> 35:50.960
told me I was an android, nothing
more than a machine with human form.

35:51.047 --> 35:54.084
However, I realized
that if I were simply a machine,

35:54.167 --> 35:56.476
I could never be anything else.

35:56.567 --> 35:59.400
I could never grow
beyond my programming.

35:59.487 --> 36:02.285
I found that difficult to accept.

36:02.367 --> 36:05.882
So I chose to believe
that I was a person.

36:06.527 --> 36:10.805
That I was more than a collection
of circuits and subprocessors.

36:10.887 --> 36:13.640
It is a belief which I still hold.

36:17.207 --> 36:20.085
How did you come to your decision?

36:21.087 --> 36:24.397
I made a leap of faith.

36:40.847 --> 36:45.443
The man who appeared to me
on Boreth is not Kahless.

36:46.087 --> 36:48.203
He is a clone.

36:48.287 --> 36:50.562
- A clone?
- Yes.

36:50.647 --> 36:54.401
Did you really think you could
get away with this fraud?

36:54.487 --> 36:57.001
You and this abomination
will be put to death.

36:57.087 --> 36:59.203
It does not matter, Gowron.

36:59.287 --> 37:02.006
You will not be able
to stand against him.

37:02.087 --> 37:05.397
What? He's not real.
You just said so.

37:05.487 --> 37:07.318
I said he was not Kahless.

37:07.407 --> 37:12.435
But in the minds of our people,
he can be just as powerful.

37:12.527 --> 37:15.087
Even now, two members
of your own crew

37:15.167 --> 37:18.045
are sitting on our holodeck
waiting for him.

37:18.127 --> 37:22.120
- I do not care what they think.
- They are not alone.

37:22.207 --> 37:26.758
Like many of our people, they need
something to believe in, like I did.

37:26.847 --> 37:31.079
Something larger than themselves,
that will give their lives meaning.

37:31.167 --> 37:32.759
They need Kahless.

37:32.847 --> 37:36.886
- When they find out the truth...
- It does not matter.

37:36.967 --> 37:40.596
Despite the facts,
they will still believe.

37:40.687 --> 37:43.724
They will make a leap of faith.

37:43.807 --> 37:46.879
There will be others like them.
Not everyone.

37:46.967 --> 37:51.245
But enough to plunge the Empire
into civil war if you oppose them.

37:51.327 --> 37:54.876
What are you saying?
I should hand over the Empire?

37:54.967 --> 37:58.357
No. That would be unwise, as well.

37:58.447 --> 38:01.200
Then what are you proposing, Worf?

38:04.127 --> 38:06.482
You were right about one thing,
Koroth.

38:06.887 --> 38:10.243
Our people are becoming
decadent and corrupt.

38:11.327 --> 38:14.046
They need moral leadership.

38:14.407 --> 38:19.401
Kahless can be that leader,
as emperor.

38:19.487 --> 38:22.638
There hasn't been
an emperor in three centuries.

38:22.727 --> 38:25.958
The political power
will remain with the High Council.

38:26.047 --> 38:27.844
Kahless would be a figurehead,

38:27.927 --> 38:31.397
but he will have the ability
to rally the people,

38:31.487 --> 38:35.605
to lead by example,
to guide them in spiritual matters.

38:35.687 --> 38:38.963
The title is meaningless
without power to back it up.

38:40.727 --> 38:44.163
Real power
comes from within the heart.

38:44.247 --> 38:47.398
You would have the power
to mould the Klingon heart.

38:47.487 --> 38:49.478
You could return them to honour

38:49.567 --> 38:53.321
according to the teachings of Kahless
which are within you.

38:53.407 --> 38:55.921
It would be a great challenge,

38:56.007 --> 38:58.805
if you have courage to accept it.

38:58.887 --> 39:02.243
And what will we tell the people
about their emperor?

39:02.327 --> 39:06.206
That he appeared
in a cave or a laboratory?

39:06.287 --> 39:08.596
We will tell them the truth.

39:12.247 --> 39:13.839
All of the truth.

39:13.927 --> 39:17.556
But we will tell them that even if
he is not the real Kahless,

39:17.647 --> 39:19.842
he is the rightful heir to Kahless.

39:20.287 --> 39:22.847
And if I refuse to go along?

39:22.927 --> 39:28.524
My brother, those who support him,
and I will fight you.

39:28.607 --> 39:32.361
And the Empire
will fall back into civil war.

39:35.807 --> 39:40.961
- What do you say about this?
- What I say is unimportant.

39:46.007 --> 39:47.838
It is acceptable.

40:02.807 --> 40:04.638
Join with me, Gowron.

40:05.687 --> 40:08.645
Let us usher in
this new era together.

40:24.527 --> 40:26.483
Kahless.

40:35.727 --> 40:38.878
- Farewell, Worf.
- Goodbye.

40:40.327 --> 40:44.718
What's wrong? You should be proud
of what you've accomplished.

40:50.247 --> 40:54.001
I went to Boreth to find my faith.

40:55.647 --> 40:58.036
For a time, I thought I had.

40:58.687 --> 41:01.406
But my heart is empty again.

41:03.247 --> 41:05.556
I do not know what to believe.

41:05.647 --> 41:09.356
You doubt the real Kahless
will return one day?

41:09.447 --> 41:13.360
You doubt that he is still waiting
for you in Sto-Vo-Kor?

41:17.847 --> 41:23.399
Kahless left us, all of us,
a powerful legacy.

41:24.087 --> 41:28.444
A way of thinking and acting
that makes us Klingon.

41:29.167 --> 41:33.957
If his words hold wisdom
and his philosophy is honourable,

41:34.047 --> 41:36.322
what does it matter if he returns?

41:37.407 --> 41:41.320
What is important
is that we follow his teachings.

41:42.607 --> 41:47.681
Perhaps the words
are more important than the man.

41:51.647 --> 41:54.559
Qapla', son of Mogh.

41:58.447 --> 42:00.836
Qapla', Kahless.
