WEBVTT

00:10.170 --> 00:12.172
(cell phone chimes)

00:32.530 --> 00:35.158
(drill whirring)

00:36.130 --> 00:37.768
(cell phone chimes)

00:40.870 --> 00:43.202
(sighs)

00:46.780 --> 00:50.272
Watson, I've just had an
alarming conversation...

00:53.120 --> 00:56.339
I was expecting to
find my... housemate.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.709
No problem.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.082
I'm Gay.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.486
I'm not.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.122
It's my name.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.151
Yes, of course.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.827
I'm Sherlock.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.669
Hello.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.168
I also am... gay.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.838
So, you know, saves time.

01:13.870 --> 01:15.838
How efficient.
(door closes)

01:15.870 --> 01:17.599
Welcome to my home.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.608
(footsteps approaching)
WATSON: Oh.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.278
I see you've met Gay.

01:21.310 --> 01:24.848
Would you excuse us
for a moment... Gay?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.848
Randy is fighting off the urge
to relapse,

01:26.880 --> 01:29.280
so I'm leaving
to accompany him to a meeting.

01:29.320 --> 01:30.787
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.788
What's bothering him?

01:32.820 --> 01:34.151
He's a drug addict.

01:34.190 --> 01:35.657
Um, 1-1 see that you're, uh,

01:35.690 --> 01:37.555
looking into my trunk
of unsolved cases.

01:37.590 --> 01:40.525
Yes. You told me to _look
Into It In my spare tIme.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.221
I think I might have
found something

01:42.270 --> 01:43.191
in the Doug Newberg file.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.697
You remember
the case, right?

01:44.730 --> 01:46.561
He was shot in his
home in Riverdale.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.307
Uh, the place was ransacked,
police found the killer's DNA,

01:49.340 --> 01:51.365
but they never
found a match.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.207
Yes. No, uh, I remember it well.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.231
Well, uh, fairly well. Vaguely.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.872
Oh. I figured
you were using,

01:56.910 --> 01:59.378
because your notes were
really disorganized.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.876
Newberg was a philanderer.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.808
I was investigating
the possibility

02:02.850 --> 02:05.216
that he had been murdered
by a man he had cuckolded.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.717
What have you learned?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.910
Well, you
remember this?

02:08.960 --> 02:11.155
HOLMES: Yeah. I mean, don't
expect me to translate.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.293
I wrote that,

02:12.330 --> 02:13.922
but I have no idea
what I meant.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.167
Oh, okay, well, I
figured that your marker

02:16.200 --> 02:18.191
exploded right here.
I wanted to see what was under

02:18.230 --> 02:20.460
the ink blotches, so I put
some nail polish remover

02:20.500 --> 02:22.331
and then some _black
coffee over It.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.235
You use_black coffee
to get rId of stains?

02:24.270 --> 02:26.306
Yes, of course. The acid in the
coffee breaks down the marker.

02:26.340 --> 02:27.477
Have you never
cleaned a whiteboard?

02:27.510 --> 02:30.308
So, look at this wall.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.840
All of it is gray except

02:31.880 --> 02:33.472
for this big black stone.
It stood out to me,

02:33.520 --> 02:34.919
so I tracked down Gay.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.247
She's a geology
fellow at NYU.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.689
I asked her to
take a look.

02:37.720 --> 02:38.914
It's interesting.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.486
Tough to tell
from the photo.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.919
But I think I see some

02:41.960 --> 02:44.485
striations on this rock,
and that would mean that...

02:44.530 --> 02:46.657
It's dug up from well beneath
the surface of the earth.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.464
Yeah, well, can't say for sure
without seeing it in person,

02:49.500 --> 02:51.798
so we're gonna go to Riverdale,
see if it's still there.

02:51.830 --> 02:53.593
Fascinating. I'll join you.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.201
Um... Randy?

02:57.240 --> 02:58.969
Oh.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.978
I know you're my sponsor
and not my shrink.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.547
It's just... we have, like,

03:03.580 --> 03:05.571
20 minutes
before the meeting starts.

03:05.610 --> 03:08.943
Is it okay if I tell you
what's going on?

03:11.590 --> 03:14.514
You know what? It's okay.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.257
You're right.
This isn't about therapy.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.696
Your sobriety is
important to me,

03:21.730 --> 03:23.595
and...

03:23.630 --> 03:26.337
this is important
to your sobriety, so...

03:28.400 --> 03:30.265
So, it's Eve.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.778
We used to live together
for, like, two years.

03:32.810 --> 03:35.699
First time I got high,
it was with her.

03:35.740 --> 03:38.300
Last time I got high,
it was with her.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.272
I couldn't get sober
till she left town.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.289
Only, now she's back.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.289
Says she wants me
to help her get clean.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.450
She wants to... live with me
while she kicks.

03:50.490 --> 03:53.823
So a, uh...

03:53.860 --> 03:56.795
practicing drug addict
wants to move in with you?

03:56.830 --> 03:58.468
Look, I know it's a bad idea.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.365
Why do you think
I'm so stressed?

04:02.310 --> 04:04.699
(sighs):
Oh.

04:07.310 --> 04:10.507
Sorry, you-you...
you want my advice?

04:10.550 --> 04:12.745
I don't know. We have some time
before the meeting.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.589
Well, as it happens,

04:16.620 --> 04:19.009
I'm more familiar
than I should be

04:19.050 --> 04:21.450
with the allure of
a dangerous woman.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.657
So I'm qualified
when I say, uh,

04:25.690 --> 04:28.488
you must cut this Eve
out of your life entirely.

04:28.530 --> 04:30.418
I should just turn
my back on her?

04:30.470 --> 04:32.028
Your sobriety
is paramount.

04:32.070 --> 04:35.392
And it may be too fragile
to withstand her influence.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.431
Is that what you did
with your woman?

04:39.910 --> 04:42.037
It's what's best.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.547
(clears throat)

04:48.480 --> 04:51.085
You sure we can just prowl
around in his backyard?

04:51.120 --> 04:52.348
People live here.

04:52.390 --> 04:53.880
Nobody's home.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.423
Anyway, I'm sure
they want us to catch

04:56.460 --> 04:59.623
whoever killed the guy
who used to live here, right?

04:59.660 --> 05:01.548
Oh, still here.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.871
GAY: You see these white
layers here? That's chalk.

05:12.910 --> 05:14.878
This is marine limestone.
IfI had to guess,

05:14.910 --> 05:15.979
I'd say it's really old.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.773
How old?

05:17.810 --> 05:21.041
Chalk deposits are typical
of the Cretaceous era.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.513
That's 65 million years ago.

05:22.550 --> 05:24.086
Looks like it's part
of this wall, huh?

05:24.120 --> 05:27.351
Oh, no, these rocks
are purely decorative.

05:27.390 --> 05:28.812
Somebody put this here.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.452
I'll tell you
something else:

05:30.490 --> 05:32.128
it was cut out
of the ground

05:32.160 --> 05:33.650
and field dressed for transport.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.122
They usually do that with
archeological specimens.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.663
So you think there's
something in there?

05:37.700 --> 05:39.361
Maybe.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.662
So now what?
(phone chimes)

05:45.610 --> 05:48.033
(elevator bell dings)

05:50.080 --> 05:51.809
Well, you're not
holding a large rock,

05:51.850 --> 05:53.841
so I take it you found someone
to do the CT scan for us.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.973
Yes.
Gay?

05:56.020 --> 05:57.817
She bailed when I asked her
to help me steal it.

05:57.850 --> 05:58.817
Randy?

05:58.850 --> 06:00.659
Still sober.
And you?

06:00.690 --> 06:02.658
You know, my life has been
carefully constructed

06:02.690 --> 06:04.885
so I don't have to do things
like talk to people

06:04.930 --> 06:06.420
about their former
romantic partners.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.654
And yet here we are.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.497
MAN:
I, uh...

06:09.530 --> 06:11.066
I looked at your rock.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.988
I-I think you're gonna
want to see this.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.509
HOLMES: Iwithdraw
my earlier skepticism.

06:17.540 --> 06:20.577
The dinosaur
in Doug Newberg's baclqard

06:20.610 --> 06:23.044
did indeed escape my notice.

06:32.150 --> 06:33.185
MAN:
Magnificent, isn't she?

06:33.220 --> 06:35.586
We pulled her
out of the ground

06:35.620 --> 06:36.848
in the Wind River Range.

06:36.890 --> 06:38.687
Agnes here is
the world's only

06:38.730 --> 06:40.994
complete Dimetrodon
skeleton.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.691
I'm, uh, Jerry Thomas.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.960
I'm the curator of
the fossil collection here.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.194
Sherlock Holmes.

06:46.230 --> 06:47.936
This is my associate
Joan Watson.

06:47.970 --> 06:51.201
Well, my assistant tells me
you're with the NYPD,

06:51.240 --> 06:52.935
and you think
you found a fossil.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.004
Okay.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.045
Is this real?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.672
We believe it is.

07:01.720 --> 07:05.042
Okay, this is amazing.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.120
This looks to me
like a Nanotyrannus.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.720
Think of it like
a miniature T. rex.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.752
It's incredibly rare.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.199
I think this is a full skeleton.

07:17.230 --> 07:18.697
It's an infant.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.197
Where do you think it came from?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.196
You told my assistant
there was a chalk striation

07:22.240 --> 07:23.537
on the rock you found it in?

07:23.570 --> 07:24.935
Yes.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.506
Okay, that's
marine limestone.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.201
We haven't found
any of that in a dig

07:28.240 --> 07:30.743
_ in_the States
In qUIte some tIme.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.543
Most recent deposits
come from Mongolia.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.070
Now, I can confirm that

07:34.120 --> 07:35.769
when I look at the rock,

07:35.820 --> 07:38.618
but if it was found there,
then it belongs to them.

07:38.650 --> 07:42.154
So someone smuggled it
into the States.

07:42.190 --> 07:43.782
How much would that be worth?

07:43.830 --> 07:46.151
I would say high seven figures.

07:46.190 --> 07:47.589
Low eight.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.228
Person that killed Doug Newberg
ransacked his place.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.738
Maybe they were
looking for that.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.658
WATSON:
So you're working on

07:55.700 --> 07:58.635
a new collage in honor
of Doug Newberg?

07:58.670 --> 08:01.503
I had Detective Bell
send me everything

08:01.540 --> 08:04.179
the NYPD has on the man.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.848
I've been through
my original notes,

08:05.880 --> 08:08.246
most of their files.

08:08.280 --> 08:12.080
Doug Newberg, rest his soul,
was a rather dull person.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.908
I can't find anything which
connects him to smuggling.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.087
Except for the dinosaur
in his baclqard.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.654
I'm trying to
immerse myself

08:19.700 --> 08:21.156
in the particulars of
Mr. Newberg's life.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.997
If he was not involved
with the black market,

08:23.030 --> 08:26.090
perhaps someone
in his orbit was.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.928
Hey, how is it
getting back into a case

08:28.970 --> 08:30.938
you were working on
when you were using?

08:33.110 --> 08:35.635
Interesting.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.272
There were times,
before I ended up in the gutter,

08:37.310 --> 08:40.074
where I functioned extremely
well with my addiction.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.941
In spite of the fact

08:42.990 --> 08:44.946
that I accepted payment
from Mr. Newberg's parents,

08:44.990 --> 08:47.049
this investigation
is very clearly

08:47.090 --> 08:49.217
not one of those times.

08:49.260 --> 08:52.593
I failed to give
the man my best efforts,

08:52.630 --> 08:55.622
and that is not _
a pleasant thIng to conSIder.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.764
(phone chimes)

08:58.830 --> 09:00.297
WATSON:
Who is it?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.568
It's Randy.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.068
His gyno-difficulties
persist.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.975
A man sits before me.

09:08.010 --> 09:10.672
His continued sobriety
may or may not hang

09:10.710 --> 09:13.042
on whether I_allow him
to air hIs Issues.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.776
I choose the decent path,
distasteful as it may seem,

09:15.820 --> 09:17.185
and I hear him out.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.108
The Rubicon is crossed.

09:19.150 --> 09:21.653
I am now a confidante.

09:21.690 --> 09:22.987
IfI cut him off now,

09:23.030 --> 09:25.021
do I not potentially put
his recovery at risk?

09:27.700 --> 09:29.099
What are you
texting him?

09:30.400 --> 09:32.664
"You'll do better
next time."

09:36.770 --> 09:39.034
_ This rock wall
IS very clearly not

09:39.070 --> 09:40.970
a random hiding place.

09:41.010 --> 09:42.204
It was very clearly chosen
and very carefully...

09:42.240 --> 09:44.105
(phone chimes)

09:46.080 --> 09:49.618
How on earth did you make
a career dealing with addicts?

09:49.650 --> 09:51.811
Well, it's pretty late.
You could just call him.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.818
No.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.350
Okay, well,
I will work on

09:55.390 --> 09:57.381
the collage while you are out.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.057
It's not a collage.

09:59.090 --> 10:00.751
I don't do crafts.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.038
What time did you
get in last night?

10:09.070 --> 10:11.209
I was with Randy until

10:13.040 --> 10:15.679
Well, you're
gonna need those.

10:15.710 --> 10:17.769
After breakfast,
we're gonna get ice cream.

10:17.810 --> 10:19.641
It's the dead of winter.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.238
Why would we want
to go for ice cream?

10:21.280 --> 10:23.748
Exactly.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.940
That's Diego Salcedo.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.753
Doug Newberg was his best man

10:27.790 --> 10:29.382
at his wedding.
Diego has a record.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.058
Convicted of
small stuff,

10:31.090 --> 10:32.955
but eight years ago,
he was convicted

10:33.000 --> 10:35.298
on three_different counts
of criminal posseSSIon

10:35.330 --> 10:36.422
of stolen property.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.098
Case ended in mistrial.

10:38.130 --> 10:40.291
I looked into what
he's up to now.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.693
He owns a fleet
of Ice cream trucks

10:41.740 --> 10:43.708
that operate
all over New York.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.105
I checked with the city,

10:45.140 --> 10:47.904
and the trucks _
have current permIts.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.805
And this seems to mean
somethIng to you.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.408
It's the middle of winter.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.917
Why would he be running
a fleet of ice cream trucks?

10:52.950 --> 10:54.042
The guy that I spoke to

10:54.080 --> 10:55.445
said that most
of the operators

10:55.480 --> 10:57.380
let their permits
lapse during the winter.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.911
So why pay if you're not
selling any sundaes?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.679
Half of the trucks are idle
and half of them are permanent.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.357
And the ones
that are runnIng?

11:04.390 --> 11:06.153
They're licensed
to cover routes

11:06.190 --> 11:08.329
that are mostly
industrial areas.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.692
These industrial areas,
do they include ports?

11:10.730 --> 11:12.220
Yes.

11:12.270 --> 11:13.999
You think Diego Salcedo
is using ice cream trucks

11:14.040 --> 11:16.031
to move smuggled goods
around the city?

11:16.070 --> 11:17.867
Well, it could explain
why Doug Newberg

11:17.910 --> 11:19.901
wound up with a
fossil in his yard.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.033
Uh-huh.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.173
GREGSON:
So you think this guy

11:24.210 --> 11:26.246
had something to do
with Newberg's murder?

11:26.280 --> 11:28.339
We don't know.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.780
But if he knows
where the fossil came from,

11:30.820 --> 11:32.708
then he can get us closer
to a solution than we are now.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.819
Has anyone
claimed responsibility

11:34.860 --> 11:36.452
for the Nanotyrannus yet?

11:36.490 --> 11:39.050
No. Why?

11:39.090 --> 11:40.489
He wants to take it home.

11:40.530 --> 11:42.157
Sorry.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.997
Immigration and
Customs Enforcement

11:44.030 --> 11:47.261
are stopping by later
to, uh, take custody.

11:47.300 --> 11:51.066
If it's really from Mongolia,
they'll return it.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.235
Looks like we got
a customer.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.483
A lot of money
for a popsicle.

12:06.150 --> 12:08.152
All right,
everybody stand by.

12:08.190 --> 12:09.282
MAN (over radio):
Copy that, copy that.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.480
All units, all units...

12:10.530 --> 12:12.725
(indistinct radio chatter)

12:15.860 --> 12:18.124
Okay, that's it,
let's go!

12:18.170 --> 12:19.489
That's the order.
All units move!

12:19.530 --> 12:21.964
(sirens wailing)

12:26.210 --> 12:27.199
(officers shouting)

12:27.240 --> 12:28.537
Hey, guys.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.172
What gives?

12:30.210 --> 12:31.848
I was just returning
some unsold inventory

12:31.880 --> 12:33.814
to my distributors.

12:33.850 --> 12:35.408
Oh, yeah?

12:42.560 --> 12:44.926
No customs stamp.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.227
Cuban?

12:49.260 --> 12:50.898
I don't understand.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.067
You put a tail on me

12:52.100 --> 12:53.397
and you arrest me.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.169
All so you can ask me
a bunch of questions

12:55.200 --> 12:57.532
about a T. rex you found
at my buddy Doug's house?

12:57.570 --> 12:59.401
It's a Nanotyrannus.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.204
And we're pretty sure
you put it there.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.571
The guys you were
delivering those cigars to

13:03.610 --> 13:05.441
are ready to tell us
about all the shipments

13:05.480 --> 13:06.913
you processed for them.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.144
The counts are
gonna lee up.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.909
We say you're
our lead suspect

13:09.950 --> 13:11.281
in the murder
of Doug Newberg.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.481
Could mean the difference
between making bail or not.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.056
Wait, what are you nuts?
I grew up with Doug.

13:15.090 --> 13:16.580
He was my best man.
I didn't kill him.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.326
GREGSON:
Do you have an alibi?

13:18.360 --> 13:19.827
SALCEDO:
I don't know. That was what?

13:19.860 --> 13:21.293
Three years ago?

13:21.330 --> 13:22.592
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

13:22.630 --> 13:24.962
Two guys from Immigrations
and Customs just got here.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.467
They say you were
expecting them.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.968
Uh, tell them
I need a few minutes.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.098
How did the fossil get

13:33.140 --> 13:35.233
in your friend Doug's baclqard?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.009
All right, look.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.269
Right before Doug got killed,
I took a delivery of a rock.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.844
I don't even know
what was inside it.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.108
But the buyer--

13:43.150 --> 13:44.412
he fell out at the last minute.

13:44.450 --> 13:46.145
And I was pretty sure
somebody federal

13:46.190 --> 13:48.158
was watching my place,
so I couldn't bring it there.

13:48.190 --> 13:50.283
So I asked Doug if I could
keep it at his place,

13:50.330 --> 13:51.581
just for a couple of days.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.848
Next day, he gets killed.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.255
Did I think that the two events
were connected?

13:56.300 --> 13:58.188
Yeah, of course, somebody
must've been following me.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.289
But I always thought
that whoever killed him

14:00.340 --> 14:02.160
took the rock, too.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.861
You didn't know it
was in his backyard?

14:03.910 --> 14:05.901
I gave it to him in his garage.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.601
I mean, the guy must've stashed
the thing in there himself.

14:08.940 --> 14:11.579
I didn't kill Doug.

14:11.610 --> 14:13.510
I didn't kill Doug--
I mean, you can take my DNA.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.040
You can hook me up
to a lie detector.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.240
Whatever you need.

14:21.090 --> 14:23.422
Volunteered his DNA rather
cheerfully, didn't he?

14:23.460 --> 14:24.950
Whoever murdered Newberg

14:24.990 --> 14:27.049
wanted that skeleton,
but they never found it.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.091
We did.
And?

14:29.130 --> 14:30.563
You want to put it
on the black market,

14:30.600 --> 14:31.624
see who comes calling.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.467
Captain, I got a guy from I.C.E.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.467
hovering around my desk.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.660
Something about a fossil.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.099
What's with these guys?

14:37.140 --> 14:38.630
I told them I need
a few mInutes.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.103
Uh, it's just one.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.279
And he just got here.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.948
Yeah, they, uh, they signed
for the thing, like,

14:46.980 --> 14:49.119
I don't know, like,
ten minutes ago?

14:49.150 --> 14:51.118
You were supposed
to wait until I got here.

14:51.150 --> 14:52.617
These guys are federal.

14:52.650 --> 14:53.958
You know how they are
about sitting around.

14:53.990 --> 14:56.288
Did you confirm
their credentials?

14:56.320 --> 14:58.550
I'm guessing
that you didn't,

14:58.590 --> 15:01.650
because I got another I.C.E.
agent out in the bullpen,

15:01.700 --> 15:04.897
and Detective Bell
says that he checks out.

15:10.970 --> 15:12.631
What?

15:12.670 --> 15:15.036
You just presided
over the theft

15:15.080 --> 15:17.469
of a piece of evidence,
which also happens to be

15:17.510 --> 15:19.068
a priceless
archeological treasure.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.053
HOLMES: And off they go
with their Nanotyrannus fossil.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.297
The whole affair does have a
certain spirit of derring-do.

15:34.330 --> 15:36.298
One almost has
to admire it.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.161
Hmm.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.566
I just had
a very long conversation

15:40.600 --> 15:43.160
with my counterpart at I.C.E.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.735
They're gonna help us with the
investigation into the robbery.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.978
We've got forensics on
the paperwork they left behind,

15:49.010 --> 15:50.671
and we put a BOLO out
on the thieves.

15:50.710 --> 15:52.302
Well, whoever they are,

15:52.350 --> 15:55.012
they command
extraordinary resources.

15:55.050 --> 15:57.348
Firstly, they had to know that
we'd recovered the fossil.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.642
There's been no media coverage,
so that implies that they've

15:59.690 --> 16:02.318
cultivated a source within
ImmIgratIon and Customs.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.181
They created false documents
that were convincing enough

16:05.230 --> 16:07.721
to fool a veteran policeman,
and they timed their operation

16:07.760 --> 16:11.662
so that they arrived before
the real I.C.E. agent.

16:11.700 --> 16:15.363
What are they even gonna do
with stolen dinosaur bones?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.732
It's not like you can unload it
in some dark alley.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.260
Yeah, you have
to be wired

16:19.310 --> 16:20.732
into a network of
potentIal bIdders.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.668
People who are willing to
spend millions of dollars

16:22.710 --> 16:24.598
on illegal purchases.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.278
The question we need to ask is:
who's the biggest game in town

16:27.320 --> 16:29.413
when it comes to
smuggled antIqUItIes?

16:29.450 --> 16:31.338
We find that person,
we'll find the thieves.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.585
And I'll bet they're connected
to murder of Doug Newberg.

16:33.620 --> 16:34.757
We've got Diego's list

16:34.790 --> 16:36.382
of people that knew he was

16:36.420 --> 16:37.728
driving the fossil around.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.182
Plus, I'll get
the Port Authority

16:39.230 --> 16:41.755
to cough up their files
on high-end smugglers.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.224
We shall see if C has
any thoughts on the matter.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.658
WATSON:
Okay, so you only know her as C,

16:48.700 --> 16:50.201
and you've never
actually met her,

16:50.240 --> 16:52.060
but you think
she can help us?

16:52.110 --> 16:55.773
I know her only as C...
through choice.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.779
I could find out her real name
ifI wanted to, obviously.

16:58.810 --> 17:03.281
But, uh, using initials is
something of a convention

17:03.320 --> 17:05.686
of our mutual hobby.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.689
Which is?

17:08.720 --> 17:11.723
C and I engage
in prurient correspondence.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.489
We_ have done
for qUIte some tIme.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.828
You write each other
dIrty letters?

17:15.860 --> 17:19.296
That is a uniquely prudish
way of putting it.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.161
But yes, we do.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.497
Oh.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.566
Erotica is a fascinating
literary genre.

17:25.610 --> 17:29.171
I first encountered C on message
boards dedicated to analyzing

17:29.210 --> 17:31.201
the correspondence
of DH Lawrence.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.515
It turns out,
she is a master of the form.

17:34.550 --> 17:36.541
And so how exactly is
your naughty pen pal

17:36.580 --> 17:37.808
supposed to help us?

17:37.850 --> 17:39.818
Well, we don't
exchange much details

17:39.850 --> 17:43.251
about our private
lives, but I do know

17:43.290 --> 17:45.724
that she's an_executive
at a top auctIon house.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.399
And like most high-end houses,
they have a problem losing

17:48.430 --> 17:50.227
inventory at the ports
when they're bringing

17:50.270 --> 17:52.090
merchandise into
the country.

17:52.130 --> 17:53.734
So what are we supposed
to be looking for here?

17:53.770 --> 17:56.238
Someone carrying
The Story of O?

17:56.270 --> 17:58.602
I'm not entirely sure.

18:02.710 --> 18:05.099
You think that's her?

18:05.150 --> 18:06.674
She's described
that scarf

18:06.710 --> 18:08.712
in one of her letters.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.820
Do I look as
you'd imagined?

18:25.870 --> 18:28.361
Hard to say.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.699
The parts of you that keep
my imagination occupied are

18:31.740 --> 18:33.708
fully clothed at the moment.

18:36.310 --> 18:37.800
You have a rare
ngt, madam.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.647
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.910
Thanks for meeting me in person.

18:41.950 --> 18:45.488
I'm half-convinced my assistant
listens to all my calls.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.852
But I don't know
if I'll be able to help you.

18:47.890 --> 18:49.812
I'm an auctioneer,
not a smuggler.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.782
Surely you've rubbed
elbows with a few,

18:51.830 --> 18:53.229
after a lifetime
in the trade.

18:53.260 --> 18:55.694
There is one name.

18:55.730 --> 18:59.166
Supposedly has a stranglehold
on the trade.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.929
He's a bit of a myth actually.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.803
The employees
at our warehouses always joke

19:03.840 --> 19:05.728
that if they wanted
to make real money,

19:05.770 --> 19:07.601
they'd sell our goods
over to him.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.177
I suspect a few
of them have done it.

19:10.210 --> 19:11.746
You have a name?

19:11.780 --> 19:13.316
(laughs)
It's a bit silly.

19:13.350 --> 19:15.944
Apparently, he calls himself
"The Magpie."

19:15.980 --> 19:18.778
Any idea how I might get
in touch with him?

19:18.820 --> 19:21.812
As I understand it, you have
to have something that he wants.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.284
Then he... finds you.

19:26.590 --> 19:27.955
(door closes)

19:28.000 --> 19:29.399
(spray hissing)

19:29.430 --> 19:30.966
Hey, you back there?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.195
Mind you don't disturb the ink.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.891
Well, obviously,
you're gonna make me ask.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.737
We require a shiny bauble

19:37.770 --> 19:39.931
to attract
the attention of the Magpie.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.938
So I'm making one.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.948
(spray hissing)

19:43.980 --> 19:45.971
(clears throat)
In 1517, Martin Luther

19:46.010 --> 19:48.843
nailed his 95 Theses to
the door of Castle Church

19:48.880 --> 19:51.986
in Wittenberg, and so was born
the Reformation.

19:52.020 --> 19:54.580
Oh, yeah. I took
history in college.

19:54.620 --> 19:56.212
Did you know
he also mailed

19:56.260 --> 19:57.488
several handwritten copies

19:57.530 --> 20:00.328
to notable figures
on the very same day?

20:00.360 --> 20:01.952
It's long been rumored
that Luther

20:02.000 --> 20:06.266
labored over several
rough drafts of the document.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.792
You can imagine
what a copy might be worth.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.263
Oh, so you're writing
a fake 95 Theses.

20:12.310 --> 20:14.369
And then what?
I'm going to pose

20:14.410 --> 20:15.968
as someone who has
recently InherIted It,

20:16.010 --> 20:17.875
and has no idea
of what its worth.

20:17.910 --> 20:18.945
There are Web sites
which track

20:18.980 --> 20:20.470
the availabilities
of such things.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.240
I suppose eBay is
always an option.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.985
Is this written in English?

20:26.020 --> 20:28.284
The first few pages
are in Latin.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.958
It doesn't have
to withstand close scrutiny.

20:29.990 --> 20:32.527
It just needs to get us
in the vicinity of the Magpie.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.495
"42-- Thaddeus is hereby
declared the best apostle

20:35.530 --> 20:39.421
and those who disagree
shall be vigorously tickled."

20:40.670 --> 20:43.332
(phone chimes)

20:43.370 --> 20:45.509
(groans)

20:45.540 --> 20:46.962
What's up?

20:47.010 --> 20:49.808
I found a solution
for my Randy problem.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.341
What? And that's
upsettIng you?

20:51.380 --> 20:52.904
He mentioned Eve's
last name last nIght.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.373
She's been out of town
for more than a year.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.888
She's a heroin addict.
It's not difficult

20:57.920 --> 20:59.717
to track her movements,
nor is it unreasonable

20:59.750 --> 21:01.911
to speculate that she
may have broken the law

21:01.960 --> 21:03.382
during her sabbatical.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.284
I've just heard from
my contact in Chicago,

21:05.330 --> 21:06.922
and it turns out
that Eve Hurley has

21:06.960 --> 21:08.598
several open warrants there.

21:08.630 --> 21:11.326
All I need do is notify
the relevant authorities,

21:11.370 --> 21:13.998
and voila--
Randy's problem is solved.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.667
You're just gonna
pull her offstage with a hook?

21:15.700 --> 21:16.928
No, of course not.

21:16.970 --> 21:18.961
She's a drug addict;
I can't very well

21:19.010 --> 21:21.069
make her
my VIctIm as well.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.771
I realized I couldn't
follow through

21:22.810 --> 21:25.347
the moment I reached
out to my contact.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.814
That is why I'm upset.

21:27.850 --> 21:30.739
A perfectly good solution has
to be chucked on account of...

21:30.790 --> 21:33.509
Compassion?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.619
Your expression--
what does it mean?

21:35.660 --> 21:37.321
There's no expression.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.351
Yes, there is; you're
leaving something unsaid.

21:47.470 --> 21:49.438
I think I know what
you're thinking.

21:49.470 --> 21:51.859
That I'd like
to make dinner in peace?

21:51.910 --> 21:53.377
If Randy's gonna
stay sober,

21:53.410 --> 21:54.968
he needs to learn to
deal with stressors.

21:55.010 --> 21:57.103
If outside parties are
removing them from his life,

21:57.140 --> 21:58.971
then he's not developing
that capacity.

21:59.010 --> 22:01.046
He needs to cut her off,
that's blatantly obvious.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.809
Yet, I've indulged his desire

22:02.850 --> 22:04.818
to review the minutiae
of their relationship.

22:04.850 --> 22:06.010
You know,
I know you hate this word,

22:06.050 --> 22:07.711
but you've already been nice.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.557
You heard him out.
You gave him good advice.

22:09.590 --> 22:11.421
Why not just tell him you won't
talk about it with him anymore?

22:11.460 --> 22:14.395
Because I fear that he will
relapse if I'm firm with him.

22:14.430 --> 22:17.058
And I don't want that to happen;
not to my sponsee.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.988
I'm being vain.

22:19.030 --> 22:21.692
It's obvious that I'm not in
control of Randy's addiction

22:21.740 --> 22:25.039
any more than I'm in control
of my own.

22:25.070 --> 22:26.560
Interesting discussion.
Thank you.

22:26.610 --> 22:30.376
Huh. I mostly
just chopped shallots.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.355
(drill whirring)

22:49.130 --> 22:50.791
(phone chimes)

22:58.810 --> 23:00.675
(clears throat)

23:00.710 --> 23:02.598
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.971
I know this is getting old,

23:04.010 --> 23:06.001
but she asked me
for money last night...

23:06.050 --> 23:07.779
Randall, this has
got to stop!

23:07.820 --> 23:09.117
I know, I know.
I'm just trying to figure out...

23:09.150 --> 23:10.640
No, no, no.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.749
There's nothing
to figure out, okay?

23:12.790 --> 23:14.417
Your ex-girlfriend is a
practicing drug addict.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.882
She has absolutely
no place in your life.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.558
_ I've tried to
gIve you leeway

23:17.590 --> 23:18.921
to arrive at this
conclu5Ion on your own,

23:18.960 --> 23:20.655
but this doesn't seem
to be happening.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.053
That is my assessment
of the situation, okay?

23:22.100 --> 23:23.920
So there's nothing else
for us to discuss!

23:26.470 --> 23:27.698
Okay.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.671
Okay.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.501
Just consider what
I have, uh, suggested...

23:40.820 --> 23:42.947
...and know that it comes
from a place of concern

23:42.980 --> 23:44.811
for you and
your recovery.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.841
No, I know.

23:51.190 --> 23:52.919
I'll be right back, okay?

23:52.960 --> 23:55.099
I'm gonna run
to the bathroom.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.493
(phone ringing)

24:02.500 --> 24:04.001
Watson. (clears throat)

24:04.040 --> 24:05.200
Hey, what happened to you?

24:05.240 --> 24:06.707
You were gone before I woke up.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.037
Randall.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.229
You have to get off the phone?

24:09.280 --> 24:10.747
IfI need to end
the conversation,

24:10.780 --> 24:11.678
I will just hang up!

24:11.710 --> 24:14.577
Right.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.612
Listen, I checked that, uh,
dummy e-mail account you set up

24:17.650 --> 24:19.584
for your fake 95 Theses thing.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.508
Bunch of people
have been in touch.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.255
_Most of them seem
lIke regular collectors.

24:23.290 --> 24:25.781
But one of them came in
with no name attached.

24:25.830 --> 24:28.697
The guy says that he facilitates
discreet transactions

24:28.730 --> 24:31.028
that may not be subject
to taxes.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.765
Sounds like a black market sale.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.860
He also says that he's
the only one who can hook us in

24:35.900 --> 24:37.629
to a network
of truly high-end buyers.

24:37.670 --> 24:40.161
Seems like the Magpie guy to me.

24:40.210 --> 24:43.099
Respond. Set up a meeting
for him to inspect the theses.

24:43.140 --> 24:45.540
Okay. Do you want me to give...
(phone beeps)

24:45.580 --> 24:46.899
...Captain Gregson a heads-up?

24:49.080 --> 24:50.638
Hello?

24:50.690 --> 24:52.214
Could I have
a cup of tea, please?

24:52.250 --> 24:53.751
Of course.
Sorry. I thought

24:53.790 --> 24:54.779
you guys weren't
ordering anything.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.708
Why would you think that?

24:56.760 --> 24:58.125
Your friend just left.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.919
WATSON:
So he just left?

25:04.970 --> 25:07.791
Without so much
as a "by your leave."

25:07.840 --> 25:09.762
It's a bit disconcerting.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.109
It's certainly the last time
I take your advice.

25:12.140 --> 25:14.802
Advice? I was
chopping shallots.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.876
Did you call him?

25:16.910 --> 25:18.673
He's not answering.

25:18.710 --> 25:20.041
Well, maybe he just
needs some time.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.809
Okay, so what is
our plan here?

25:21.850 --> 25:23.784
We're just gonna
go there and ask him

25:23.820 --> 25:25.014
if he murdered
Doug Newberg?

25:25.050 --> 25:26.540
We're gathering information.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.921
Do you think he really
goes by "Magpie"?

25:31.960 --> 25:33.928
Well, I suppose
we'll find out.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.766
(door creaks)

25:51.610 --> 25:53.874
Hello?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.649
Mr. Magpie?

26:16.300 --> 26:18.700
Look at this.

26:19.740 --> 26:22.868
Look like chalk striations.

26:22.910 --> 26:25.947
They are.

26:25.980 --> 26:29.677
This is the rock that used to
contain the nanotyrannus.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.642
Someone smashed it to pieces

26:32.690 --> 26:33.987
and destroyed the fossil.

26:39.690 --> 26:41.089
GREGSON: He may have called
himself "The Magpie,"

26:41.130 --> 26:42.654
but his real name
was Malcolm Turner.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.224
The bullets didn't
finish him off,

26:44.270 --> 26:46.659
so the murderer hit him
in the back of the head

26:46.700 --> 26:47.928
with some kind
of club, huh?

26:47.970 --> 26:50.291
M.E. thinks there's
epithelial cells

26:50.340 --> 26:52.103
on Tur_ner's back _
and at the dInosaur remaIns,

26:52.140 --> 26:55.268
so it looks like we got
the killer's DNA.

26:55.310 --> 26:58.302
This person murders
Malcolm Turner,

26:58.350 --> 27:01.148
and_ then takes the time_
to WIllfully destroy a fossH

27:01.180 --> 27:02.647
worth millions
of dollars.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.011
Why would anyone do that?

27:04.050 --> 27:06.018
Maybe it was one
of Turner's competitors.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.154
But I can't see_
why anyone famIIIar

27:08.190 --> 27:10.249
with the invisible hand
of the market would

27:10.290 --> 27:13.179
destroy something, obliterate
something of such value.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.255
_ There's an _
InterestIng motIve

27:15.300 --> 27:16.824
hidden here somewhere.

27:16.860 --> 27:18.725
We just need to root it out.

27:20.970 --> 27:23.165
(opera music playing)

27:27.240 --> 27:28.207
(music stops)

27:28.240 --> 27:30.231
(snoring)

27:31.280 --> 27:33.942
Gay?

27:33.980 --> 27:36.073
Why is Gay asleep on our couch?

27:36.120 --> 27:38.384
I worked her hard.

27:38.420 --> 27:40.888
Don't be territorial about
your geologIst, Watson.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.785
I was _in need_ of one
thIs evenIng.

27:42.820 --> 27:44.959
I'm guessing that's why
you're blasting

27:44.990 --> 27:47.254
"Marriage of Figaro"
at 4:00 in the morning.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.190
You don't even like opera.

27:49.230 --> 27:51.198
No, of course I don't.

27:51.230 --> 27:52.868
All _the_ tedious
hIstrIonIcs.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.390
I was using it
to stay awake.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.864
I believe I have learned why

27:57.910 --> 28:00.231
the Magpie's killer
destroyed the nanotyrannus.

28:03.810 --> 28:05.698
"Dead Clade Walking."

28:05.750 --> 28:08.412
HOLMES: A "clade" is a term
for a group of animals

28:08.450 --> 28:10.782
which has survived an
extInctIon-level event.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.288
It's widely acknowledged
in paleontological circles

28:13.320 --> 28:15.788
_that the extinction of
the dInosaurs was brought about

28:15.820 --> 28:18.186
by a comet striking
the surface of the Earth

28:18.230 --> 28:20.357
approximately
66 million years ago.

28:20.390 --> 28:23.325
The foundation of this belief
is a layer of rock

28:23.360 --> 28:25.066
beneath the surface
of the Earth

28:25.100 --> 28:27.261
which has an abundance
of rare metals

28:27.300 --> 28:29.439
thought to be common
in comets and asteroids

28:29.470 --> 28:32.906
called the "KT Boundary."

28:32.940 --> 28:34.498
Yeah, I read about that
somewhere.

28:34.540 --> 28:37.509
They only find dinosaur fossils
below the KT Boundary, right?

28:37.540 --> 28:40.202
Mm. Apart from a few very rare
exceptions, yes.

28:40.250 --> 28:43.242
Stands to reason: if the
dinosaurs were rendered extinct

28:43.280 --> 28:45.089
by the comet which created
the KT Boundary,

28:45.120 --> 28:47.315
you couldn't very well find
their bones above it, right?

28:47.350 --> 28:49.079
Right. Right?

28:49.120 --> 28:50.519
Maybe.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.824
A new generation of
paleontologists has seized upon

28:52.860 --> 28:55.294
the few fossils found above
the KT Boundary to suggest

28:55.330 --> 28:58.197
that some dinosaurs survived
the comet's Impact.

28:58.230 --> 29:00.221
Like Martin Luther before them,
they have dared

29:00.270 --> 29:02.295
to challenge the orthodoxy
of the institution

29:02.340 --> 29:04.001
which gives them
their livelihood.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.406
They call their theory
"Dead Clade Walking."

29:06.440 --> 29:08.931
And it's enormously
controversial in the field.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.175
Okay, so maybe dinosaurs lived
longer than we thought.

29:11.210 --> 29:12.302
Why is that controversial?

29:12.350 --> 29:14.318
Well, why is anything
controversial?

29:14.350 --> 29:16.318
These people need something
to argue about,

29:16.350 --> 29:17.988
and "Dead Clade Walking"
has yielded

29:18.020 --> 29:19.282
a bumper crop of conflict.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.413
(sighs)

29:21.460 --> 29:24.452
Well, sounds like
a really good episode of Nova,

29:24.490 --> 29:27.994
but I'm not sure what it has
to do with our investigation.

29:28.030 --> 29:30.828
Rock the nanotyrannus
was found in.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.327
I decided to take a closer look
at Its compOSItIon.

29:33.370 --> 29:36.294
And Gay has confirmed
that it seems to have

29:36.340 --> 29:38.035
certain geological features

29:38.070 --> 29:40.265
which would suggest it was
buried above the KT Boundary.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.437
It would be the first

29:42.480 --> 29:45.199
complete skeleton found there.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.444
So it could have proven
the theory?

29:46.480 --> 29:48.812
Though we will never know.

29:48.850 --> 29:51.341
Whoever destroyed the sample
has made sure of that.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.279
You think someone was willing
to kill just to keep

29:54.320 --> 29:56.459
"Dead Clade Walking"
from being declared true?

29:56.490 --> 29:58.856
Murders have been committed
on the basis of far less.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.118
Who would do that?

30:00.160 --> 30:02.958
I don't know. Not yet.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.821
But I'm assembling a list of
the city's most vocal opponents

30:05.870 --> 30:07.292
to "Dead Clade Walking."

30:07.330 --> 30:09.389
Seemed like a good place
to start.

30:12.010 --> 30:14.205
WATSON: You've all been asked
here today because you represent

30:14.240 --> 30:16.208
the most strident opposition
to "Dead Clade Walking."

30:16.240 --> 30:19.243
You might be interested to know
that we recently found

30:19.280 --> 30:23.046
a nanotyrannus skeleton
that may have been buried

30:23.080 --> 30:25.082
well above the KT Layer.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.314
(all murmuring)

30:26.350 --> 30:27.544
Unfortunately,
the fossil was destroyed

30:27.590 --> 30:31.356
and the person
in possession of it was killed.

30:31.390 --> 30:34.496
We believe someone with
a vested Interest In keepIng

30:34.530 --> 30:36.919
"Dead Clade Walking"
from being proven right

30:36.960 --> 30:39.428
was behind the murder.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.097
You think one of us did it?

30:41.140 --> 30:43.165
Do I look like I'm running
around planning murders?

30:43.200 --> 30:45.407
BELL: We'd like each of you
to volunteer a cheek swab,

30:45.440 --> 30:48.170
and we'll test it against some
DNA we found at the crime scene.

30:48.210 --> 30:49.507
You don't have to agree,
of course,

30:49.540 --> 30:52.509
although you would be
assisting an active

30:52.550 --> 30:54.415
homicide investigation
if you do.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.543
Okay, whatever.
This is silly.

31:00.520 --> 31:01.953
Problem?

31:01.990 --> 31:06.188
With giving my DNA
to the police? Yes.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.027
I do have a
problem with that.

31:13.430 --> 31:15.159
(door opens, closes)

31:15.200 --> 31:17.668
(quietly): Guy takes
his privacy seriously.

31:17.700 --> 31:21.534
Yeah. His name is
Ivan Kershavin.

31:21.580 --> 31:25.175
And perhaps our investigation
just found a bit of focus.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.678
WATSON: Let's say this guy
really did kill the Magpie.

31:27.710 --> 31:30.508
He has_ to know we're
watchIng hIm, rIght?

31:30.550 --> 31:32.984
I mean, even if we use
his social media

31:33.020 --> 31:34.487
to track down where
he'll be today,

31:34.520 --> 31:36.681
you really think he's gonna
throw away a tissue

31:36.720 --> 31:38.654
so we can get
a DNA sample?

31:38.690 --> 31:41.056
Well, he wouldn't
if he was a competent criminal.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.988
But the good investigator
never rules out

31:43.030 --> 31:46.158
the possibility
that one's quarry is a fool.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.236
Are you worried
about Randy?

31:50.270 --> 31:52.932
No, I'm-I'm just checking to see
if he's called, that's all.

31:54.740 --> 31:56.935
You know, if he has cut me off,
it'll be a relief.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.601
Sponsorship is
a rislq investment

31:59.650 --> 32:01.345
of one's time and energy,
quite frankly.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.075
BELL:
Well, you can back off

32:03.120 --> 32:04.712
that Kershavin guy.

32:04.750 --> 32:07.958
We got the preliminary results
from the DNA samples we took.

32:07.990 --> 32:10.379
There is a match for what
we found at the scene.

32:10.420 --> 32:11.626
It's Andrew Donnelly.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.348
The guy in the wheelchair?

32:16.530 --> 32:17.349
Guy is smart enough

32:17.400 --> 32:20.324
_ to not talk until
hIs lawyer gets here.

32:20.370 --> 32:22.338
I know DNA is DNA,

32:22.370 --> 32:24.634
but I'm having a hard time
getting my head around that guy

32:24.670 --> 32:26.262
shooting a career criminal

32:26.310 --> 32:29.973
and then clubbing him to death.

32:30.010 --> 32:32.069
He gave us his DNA.

32:32.110 --> 32:35.978
He knew a refusal would
make mm a suspect.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.612
Perhaps he's hoping
we were bluffing.

32:37.650 --> 32:40.517
_I know the visual's
Incongruous, but...

32:40.550 --> 32:42.154
Andrew Donnelly is

32:42.190 --> 32:44.579
a superstar of
paleontology.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.281
He's also the leading opponent
of "Dead Clade Walking."

32:47.330 --> 32:49.423
He's staked out
a very pubIIc pOSItIon,

32:49.460 --> 32:51.462
so he's got quite a bit to lose:

32:51.500 --> 32:53.195
speaking fees,
consulting jobs.

32:53.230 --> 32:54.629
The books that he writes

32:54.670 --> 32:57.195
would no doubt
fall out of circulation.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.561
You like him for
the Doug Newberg murder, too?

32:59.610 --> 33:02.602
Actually, we just got the
results comparing the DNA

33:02.640 --> 33:04.779
from both crime scenes;
they don't match.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.573
We're looking for
two different killers.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.272
Maybe the Newberg
murder was just

33:09.320 --> 33:11.117
a garden-variety
burglary gone wrong.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.583
Seems unlikely.

33:14.290 --> 33:16.554
Well, let's see.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.729
Maybe he'll confess
to the Magpie's murder.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.227
(knocking)

33:20.260 --> 33:21.659
Oh.

33:26.430 --> 33:27.727
Oh, you can turn around,
Counselor.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.590
We're ready to begin
questioning your client.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.529
There isn't gonna be an
interrogation of Mr. Donnelly.

33:32.570 --> 33:34.606
My client is the victim
of a frame-up.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.302
Malcolm Turner,
this man

33:37.340 --> 33:38.546
who called himself
"The Magpie"--

33:38.580 --> 33:40.445
he was killed yesterday
morning, right?

33:40.480 --> 33:42.619
Sometime between
10:00 and 12:00?

33:42.650 --> 33:45.642
Andrew Donnelly was
leading a guided tour

33:45.690 --> 33:48.386
of the Triboro Museum
of Natural History

33:48.420 --> 33:50.456
from 9:00 a.m. until 2:30.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.082
It's something
he does every year

33:52.130 --> 33:54.052
for people who donate
big money to his department.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.795
I've got
Instagram photos

33:55.830 --> 33:57.457
posted during
the tour itself,

33:57.500 --> 33:59.559
and more than a
dozen mIIIIonaIres

33:59.600 --> 34:01.659
who can vouch for
his whereabouts.

34:01.700 --> 34:05.238
I take it you'll be
issuing an apology

34:05.270 --> 34:07.738
along with
Mr. Donnelly's release.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.139
Well, it... (clears throat)
appears she's correct.

34:14.180 --> 34:17.069
Mr. Donnelly could not have
murdered the Magpie.

34:17.120 --> 34:20.385
Well, how the hell did his DNA
get to the crime scene?

34:39.270 --> 34:42.205
Why are you cutting up
the Magpie case file?

34:42.240 --> 34:44.470
I am reducing it
to digestible chunks.

34:44.510 --> 34:47.877
A 1953 study at the
University of Michigan

34:47.910 --> 34:49.343
found that
planarIan worms

34:49.380 --> 34:52.247
could navigate a maze
more successfully

34:52.290 --> 34:55.179
after ingesting
the remains of other worms

34:55.220 --> 34:56.812
who had also run
the same course.

34:56.860 --> 35:00.785
Perhaps if I ingest the file,
it will offer fresh insights.

35:00.830 --> 35:02.320
You're not really gonna

35:02.360 --> 35:04.464
eat that entire
stack of paper, rIght?

35:04.500 --> 35:05.797
Andrew Donnelly's DNA was found

35:05.830 --> 35:07.388
at the scene
of the Magpie's murder,

35:07.430 --> 35:09.159
but he did not commit the crime.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.169
Ivan Kershavin refused
to gIve us a sample

35:12.210 --> 35:13.563
of his DNA,
but two hours ago,

35:13.610 --> 35:15.271
a detective pulled
a can of soda

35:15.310 --> 35:17.232
from his rubbish
and got one for us anyway.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.544
Not a match.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.377
I'm at_a loss.
(snIffs)

35:21.420 --> 35:23.411
Hence, a new perspective
on the problem.

35:25.350 --> 35:28.581
Well, the Magpie kept records of
all his transactions, right?

35:28.620 --> 35:30.417
Gregson pulled it
from his studio.

35:30.460 --> 35:34.191
If we figure out
who the customers were,

35:34.230 --> 35:36.755
maybe we can come up with
a new list of suspects.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.722
Thank you for your insights.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.830
I would not have thought
of that on my own.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.809
The Magpie identified his
customers via pseudonyms.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.375
He sold a tapestry
from a castle

35:54.420 --> 35:56.274
in Ireland to
a "Bch Wanderstick."

35:56.320 --> 35:58.515
A bracelet supposedly
worn by Genghis Khan

35:58.550 --> 36:01.587
went to "Michael
McBender," so on.

36:01.620 --> 36:04.350
WATSON: At least the guy
has a bad sense of humor.

36:04.390 --> 36:06.620
"Snipes Houlihan"--
he's got his own

36:06.660 --> 36:08.355
separate column.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.822
Four different sales.

36:09.860 --> 36:11.327
"D-apostrophe-phalange."

36:11.370 --> 36:12.564
"D-apostrophe-humerus."

36:12.600 --> 36:14.192
"D-apostrophe-atlas/axis."

36:14.240 --> 36:16.697
A toe, an arm,
top of the spine...

36:16.740 --> 36:20.562
The transactions happened
over a period of months, so...

36:20.610 --> 36:23.238
I want to know
why they're linked.

36:31.420 --> 36:32.819
(sighs)

36:44.730 --> 36:46.721
*

37:04.490 --> 37:07.482
I'm guessing there's
a good reason for all of this.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.688
I'm trying to attract the
attention of "Snipes Houlihan."

37:11.730 --> 37:13.322
You know who he is?

37:13.360 --> 37:14.452
I was curious as to why

37:14.500 --> 37:15.956
the sales were grouped

37:16.000 --> 37:17.854
under the heading
"D-apostrophe-D."

37:17.900 --> 37:20.664
When I reasoned that the Magpie
would only be trading

37:20.700 --> 37:23.396
in bones of species
which were rare or extinct,

37:23.440 --> 37:25.635
I quickly developed a theory

37:25.670 --> 37:28.036
as to what it meant.

37:28.070 --> 37:30.675
He sold three different
Dimetrodon bones

37:30.710 --> 37:32.405
to the same buyer.
Precisely.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.338
Three different bones

37:34.380 --> 37:36.746
from three wildly divergent
locations on the body.

37:36.780 --> 37:40.409
Why would one need
a toe, an arm, leg,

37:40.450 --> 37:41.883
and a piece of
the spinal column?

37:41.920 --> 37:43.512
Well, I can read.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.879
I'm guessing you think
that he used it

37:44.930 --> 37:45.988
to fill out this display.

37:46.030 --> 37:47.520
A display which claims to be

37:47.560 --> 37:49.858
the only complete
skeleton of its kind,

37:49.900 --> 37:51.891
but which is, in fact, augmented

37:51.930 --> 37:55.639
by bones which were purchased
on the black market.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.428
So that man we met,
Jerome Thomas--

37:59.470 --> 38:01.734
he said that he supervised
the dig himself.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.008
He did.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.871
He personally oversaw

38:04.910 --> 38:06.844
the cataloging
of all the findings.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.519
You think he faked
finding a complete skeleton

38:09.550 --> 38:12.417
and then bought the missing
pieces on the black market.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.381
But what does this have to do

38:15.420 --> 38:16.512
with the Magpie's murder?

38:16.560 --> 38:19.381
It's the link which connects

38:19.430 --> 38:21.625
the murders of Doug Newberg
and the Magpie.

38:21.660 --> 38:24.367
Firstly, it establishes
that Dr. Thomas knew

38:24.400 --> 38:26.595
and did business with the man.

38:26.630 --> 38:27.995
He would no doubt know

38:28.030 --> 38:30.362
what he had up for sale
at any given moment.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.630
The textbook I gave you--
did you notice who wrote it?

38:35.610 --> 38:38.033
Andrew Donnelly. He's...

38:38.080 --> 38:39.707
He's the man
whose DNA was found

38:39.750 --> 38:41.570
at the scene of
the Magpie's murder.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.815
And Jerome Thomas.

38:43.850 --> 38:46.614
They collaborated
on that book, which is used

38:46.650 --> 38:47.844
as the introductory text

38:51.530 --> 38:54.419
Now, Andrew Donnelly's
reputation would be ruined

38:54.460 --> 38:56.428
if "Dead Clade Walking"
were proven correct.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.996
So what do you think
would happen

38:58.030 --> 38:59.566
to sales of his textbook?

38:59.600 --> 39:00.897
I'm sure they would plummet.

39:00.930 --> 39:02.397
What do you suppose would happen
to the reputation

39:02.440 --> 39:03.395
of his close associates?

39:03.440 --> 39:05.601
They'd be tainted, too.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.801
JEROME: What one earth
are you two doing?

39:07.840 --> 39:10.070
You found out
there was a fossil

39:10.110 --> 39:11.646
that could prove
"Dead Clade Walking,"

39:11.680 --> 39:14.410
and you killed Doug Newberg
to get your hands on it.

39:14.450 --> 39:16.714
What? _ _
You couldn't ﬁnd It,
so you thought it was lost,

39:16.750 --> 39:18.741
until the Magpie
put it up for sale again.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.657
And then you planted
Andrew Donnelly's DNA

39:21.690 --> 39:23.487
at the second murder.
Actually,

39:23.520 --> 39:24.623
I think that was a mistake.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.457
I think you used a tool that

39:26.490 --> 39:28.492
you and Dr. Donnelly probably
shared in the ﬁeld.

39:28.530 --> 39:31.465
Maybe you brought it with you
to destroy the fossil.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.422
I don't know what
you're talking about,

39:33.470 --> 39:35.461
but you two
need to leave.

39:36.670 --> 39:38.433
Yeah, all right.

39:38.470 --> 39:39.664
If that's what you want.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.837
We don't have enough
evidence to arrest you,

39:41.880 --> 39:45.077
anyway. But...
the police are drawing up

39:45.110 --> 39:47.476
a warrant for your DNA
as we speak.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.909
And you and I

39:48.950 --> 39:50.838
both know it's going
to match the material

39:50.880 --> 39:52.609
found at Doug Newberg's
three years ago.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.811
They're also going to be
able to search your home

39:54.860 --> 39:57.579
and your lab for
the murder weapon.

39:57.620 --> 39:59.485
So, given all that,

39:59.530 --> 40:03.022
I thought I'd give you
the opportunity to confess.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.765
The academic community
was stunned today

40:09.800 --> 40:13.668
as Dr. Jerome Thomas,
curator of the fossil collection

40:13.710 --> 40:15.598
at the Triboro Museum
of Natural History,

40:15.640 --> 40:18.700
was charged with
two separate murders...

40:22.180 --> 40:24.171
(sighs)

40:33.890 --> 40:35.653
(drill whirring)

40:35.700 --> 40:37.053
(door opens)
WATSON: Hey.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.659
This was at the
front stoop for you.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.531
Ah.

40:43.570 --> 40:45.128
This would be the remains
of the Nanotyrannus.

40:45.170 --> 40:47.058
Oh. You mean
a pile of dust?

40:47.110 --> 40:48.509
This creature survived

40:48.540 --> 40:49.802
the single greatest

40:49.840 --> 40:51.239
extinction-level
event In hIstory.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.077
It deserves
a loftIer restIng place

40:53.110 --> 40:54.543
than someone's dustbin.

40:54.580 --> 40:55.945
Do you feel good?

40:57.550 --> 40:58.778
You solved the case.

41:00.850 --> 41:03.887
Doug Newberg's parents finally
know what happened to their son.

41:05.090 --> 41:08.127
Yes, I suppose I do.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.889
You don't _have
to say It.

41:09.930 --> 41:11.488
I know what you're thinking.

41:11.530 --> 41:12.929
The odds are
reasonably good

41:12.970 --> 41:14.790
that none of this would have
happened without you.

41:16.540 --> 41:17.837
Allow me to return the favor

41:17.870 --> 41:19.838
by releasing the evil humours
from your skull.

41:19.870 --> 41:21.132
(drill whirs)

41:23.180 --> 41:25.740
I'm good.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.584
(knocking)

41:40.660 --> 41:42.651
*

41:53.610 --> 41:55.828
So, um...

41:59.850 --> 42:02.546
I got high with
Eve last night.

42:02.580 --> 42:05.879
I see.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.683
I woke up this morning

42:07.720 --> 42:11.622
and I told her that I never
wanted to see her again.

42:11.660 --> 42:12.729
It's over.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.724
I don't know if you're
still my sponsor or not,

42:17.760 --> 42:19.569
but if you'd
be willing...

42:19.600 --> 42:21.227
So you want to go to a meeting?

42:22.270 --> 42:23.828
Right now?

42:25.310 --> 42:26.834
Yeah.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.231
All right.
