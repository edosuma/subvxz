-Mmm. Sophia, what are you doing up?
-I'm cooking. I couldn't sleep.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.600
Me neither. What are you making?

01:02.667 --> 01:07.567
Sausage and peppers, pasta pesto,
and ziti with oil and garlic.

01:07.633 --> 01:10.767
-Ooh, ooh. And what's this?
-Garbage. Rose cooked it.

01:11.967 --> 01:16.100
Mmm! This kitchen smells terrific.
My chipped beef must be done.

01:16.667 --> 01:20.834
Sophia, would you like a little scoop
on some toasted white bread?

01:20.900 --> 01:22.700
What do I look like, Beetle Bailey?

01:24.767 --> 01:28.433
Ma, you'll never guess
who I just spoke with.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.300
-Uncle Vito.
-How did you know?

01:30.367 --> 01:32.033
I picked up the phone and listened in.

01:34.033 --> 01:35.834
It's a little thing I do.

01:36.333 --> 01:40.500
My uncle Vito's coming to visit,
and he's staying with us.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.166
He arrives Thursday for a whole week.

01:43.533 --> 01:47.133
-Where will he stay?
-My room. I'll sleep with ma.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.033
My cousin Milo's coming.
Don't you remember?

01:51.100 --> 01:54.633
He's going to be in town
for the 14th annual hog expo.

01:58.166 --> 02:01.100
Is it the 14th annual already?

02:01.900 --> 02:04.734
It seems just like yesterday
it was the 12th annual.

-Dorothy, cut it out.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.433
What are we going to do?

02:12.700 --> 02:15.934
We'll figure out some arrangements.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.600
Besides, everything will work out fine,

02:17.667 --> 02:20.700
as long as I don't
have to sleep with Rose.

02:20.767 --> 02:26.066
-Why won't you want to sleep with me?
-For starters, you talk in your sleep.

02:26.133 --> 02:28.433
And let's face it,
you're no Dick Cavett awake.

02:29.800 --> 02:34.533
-I do not talk in my sleep.
-Oh, yes, you do, and you snore!

02:34.600 --> 02:38.000
-No, I don't. Dorothy snores!
-Oh, that's right.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.967
You snore worse than a sailor

02:40.033 --> 02:43.433
passed out at an adult motel
after a night of passion

02:43.500 --> 02:45.967
while I had to call a cab...

02:51.834 --> 02:53.667
never mind.
The point is, you snore.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.333
None of you is a day at the beach.

02:57.600 --> 03:01.700
Remember when the heat gave out?
Boy, what a night!

03:12.066 --> 03:15.400
Salvadore, if you want to fool around,
take off your t-shirt.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.467
You're going to get linguine all over me.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.934
Ma, go back to sleep.
It's just me, Dorothy.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.266
Get the hell out of here!

03:29.300 --> 03:32.100
Ma, have a heart. The heat went out again.

03:32.433 --> 03:36.100
I'm freezing to death.
You have the only electric blanket.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.934
I'll die under here with you.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Your body's like a heat sponge.
I'll get up a frozen fish stick.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.567
Ma, don't be ridiculous.
Turn up the heat.

03:46.633 --> 03:49.967
It's already on 9.
On 10, you can cook a Lean Cuisine.

03:51.133 --> 03:52.467
Good night, ma.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
You know, ma...

04:00.066 --> 04:01.433
this reminds me of the time

04:01.500 --> 04:04.367
the heat went out in our apartment
back in Brooklyn.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.800
I was about 7 years old.

04:06.867 --> 04:10.400
I was still sleeping with my rag doll
Mrs. Doolittle.

04:11.266 --> 04:14.767
I remember I woke up
with my teeth chattering.

04:14.834 --> 04:18.834
I tiptoed to your bedroom door...

04:18.900 --> 04:25.367
I opened it a crack, and I whispered,
"Mommy, Mrs. Doolittle is cold.

04:25.934 --> 04:28.166
-Mommy, Mrs. Doolittle--"
-Dorothy.

04:28.233 --> 04:30.767
-Yes, ma?
-Cut the crap. I'm not in the mood!

04:34.133 --> 04:37.600
Oh, girls!
Could I share your electric blanket?

04:37.667 --> 04:38.667
-No.
-No.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.400
I can't sleep.

04:40.467 --> 04:43.967
My bed's never been so cold,
especially on a Saturday night.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.300
Oh, all right. Get in.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.300
Brrr!

04:52.266 --> 04:53.500
Listen, did you hear that sound?

04:54.066 --> 04:57.133
Yeah, and in my bed, I'll do what I want.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.567
I mean, it sounded like
the heat kicking on.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.133
Get back to your own beds.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.934
-Hi, everybody.
-What are you doing?

05:23.000 --> 05:27.100
-Trying to fix the heater.
-Rose, you're a genius.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.767
Boy, that's a sentence
you don't hear every day.

05:31.433 --> 05:34.400
She's working great, except for one thing.

05:34.767 --> 05:38.533
I turned the air conditioner on,
and it won't go off.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.367
It'll be colder inside than it is outside!

05:42.433 --> 05:43.567
I think you're right.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.567
There's an icicle forming
on the nose of my bunny slippers.

05:46.967 --> 05:51.300
-Move over.
-Oh. Ow!

05:51.834 --> 05:52.834
Oh!

05:53.300 --> 05:54.300
Oh.

05:55.700 --> 05:59.433
There. That's not so bad.
Get your bunny nose out of my butt.

06:02.934 --> 06:06.300
-Let's just get some sleep!
-Good night, ma.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.667
Good night, Moe. Good night, Larry.

06:12.867 --> 06:16.800
I won't be able to sleep.
I'm on the wrong side of the bed.

06:16.867 --> 06:20.400
I usually sleep on the right.
I want the right.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.467
What the hell is everyone
so particular about?

06:23.533 --> 06:25.734
In Sicily, four in a bed is a treat.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.367
It means half your family is on vacation.

06:32.233 --> 06:34.834
I slept with my two brothers
until I was 17.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.000
I was engaged to one
for a very short period of time.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.300
But that's a separate story.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.033
I wouldn't mind hearing it.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.834
-Oh.
-Rose, shut up!

06:47.033 --> 06:51.367
Stay where you are and go to sleep!
I have to work early in the morning.

06:54.967 --> 06:58.000
-Oh, darn. I forgot something.
-Go in your pajamas.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.900
No, it's not that.

07:01.967 --> 07:03.900
I forgot to say my prayers.

07:03.967 --> 07:07.800
Oh, Rose! God wouldn't mind
if you skipped a night.

07:07.867 --> 07:09.700
He's very busy these days.

07:09.767 --> 07:12.767
Most of his free time
is spent talking to Pat Robertson.

07:16.233 --> 07:17.500
Hello, God. It's me.

07:17.967 --> 07:18.967
Rose Nylund.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.166
Sorry I'm getting in touch
so late tonight.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.834
Hope I didn't wake you.

07:24.533 --> 07:25.800
Oh, God.

07:27.033 --> 07:28.700
One at a time, Blanche.

07:31.533 --> 07:33.667
Anyway, I just wanted to say I...

07:34.266 --> 07:36.767
think you're still doing a terrific job.

07:37.567 --> 07:39.900
Of course, there's some things
I don't understand...

07:40.300 --> 07:41.400
like poverty...

07:42.633 --> 07:45.700
and the spokes model category
on <i>Star Search.</i>

07:47.333 --> 07:50.967
But then again, you work your wonders
in mysterious ways.

07:51.967 --> 07:53.967
A couple of years ago,
on a night like this,

07:54.033 --> 07:57.066
I would've frozen to death
because I was by myself...

07:57.633 --> 08:01.967
and now I have Dorothy and Blanche
and Sophia to keep me warm.

08:02.033 --> 08:05.200
Not just in winter, but all year long.

08:07.166 --> 08:08.767
Take care of them, God.

08:09.066 --> 08:10.467
If anything happened, I just--

08:10.533 --> 08:14.400
(Dorothy as God)
Rose, thanks for the lovely prayer.

08:20.233 --> 08:24.367
Now shut up and get into bed.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.000
Amen!

08:32.200 --> 08:33.667
Nice work, Dorothy.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.400
It wasn't me.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.200
Sweet Jesus, am I in trouble?

08:46.100 --> 08:48.033
Now I lay me down to sleep...

08:50.400 --> 08:52.500
I'd almost forgotten about that night.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.600
With all of us cramped into that bed,

08:54.667 --> 08:58.333
I slept in positions
I never thought possible.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.400
Me, too.

09:09.266 --> 09:11.767
Sophia, when's that food going
to be ready to taste?

09:11.834 --> 09:15.667
-My beef is ready.
-I really wanted something hot.

09:15.734 --> 09:18.900
-Mine's hot.
-I really wanted something spicy.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.166
Mine's spicy!

09:20.233 --> 09:23.633
She really wanted something
that wouldn't test her gag reflex.

09:24.967 --> 09:29.266
-I'll fix you a plate of mine, Blanche.
-And I'll try some of yours.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.467
Coming right up.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.867
-(thunder)
-Oh!

09:33.934 --> 09:35.867
Oh, I hate thunderstorms!

09:35.934 --> 09:37.567
They make me a nervous wreck.

09:37.633 --> 09:40.367
That's another reason
I hate bunking with you, Rose.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.033
Everything makes you nervous,

09:42.100 --> 09:43.633
and when you're nervous,
you're unbearable.

09:44.367 --> 09:47.033
Remember that night
you barged into my room

09:47.100 --> 09:49.967
like a raving lunatic?
I was ready to kill you.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.700
(thunder)

10:00.867 --> 10:02.767
-(knock on door)
-Come in.

10:03.266 --> 10:04.600
-Blanche.
-Hmm?

10:04.667 --> 10:07.367
I just heard on the radio
two killers escaped

10:07.433 --> 10:10.433
-from a Georgia state penitentiary.
-So?

10:10.900 --> 10:12.133
"So?"

10:12.200 --> 10:14.133
They could be headed here.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.934
Honey, they escaped in Georgia.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.600
-Why on Earth would they come to Miami?
-For the same reason we did.

10:20.934 --> 10:22.333
Eligible men?

10:24.033 --> 10:26.500
Rose, I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.133
Well, I...

10:28.433 --> 10:30.734
-I just thought you ought to know.
-Yeah, I appreciate it.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.233
-I won't bother you again.
-Good night.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.266
Oh, please, Blanche!

10:38.333 --> 10:40.934
Please. I'm too scared
to go back to my room.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
This kind of thing has
always frightened me.

10:43.066 --> 10:44.567
Ever since I was a little girl.

10:44.633 --> 10:48.967
When I first heard my parents whispering
about the St. Olaf slasher.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.633
-Slasher?
-Yes.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.700
Oh, he terrorized St. Olaf for months.

10:54.967 --> 10:58.900
In the dark of night, he'd sneak in
to an unsuspecting farmer's field

10:58.967 --> 11:02.367
and mercilessly slash
your scarecrow to shreds.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.400
He was a scarecrow slasher?

11:07.734 --> 11:08.834
Primarily.

11:09.133 --> 11:12.900
Although he was suspected in the
disfigurement of several whiskbrooms.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.333
Oh. I was so scared at night,

11:16.400 --> 11:18.200
I'd sleep in the closet
so he couldn't find me.

11:18.266 --> 11:19.867
Rose. Don't say another word to me.

11:19.934 --> 11:21.433
Get into bed
and don't say another word.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.600
Oh, Blanche.
You'll never even know I'm here.

11:23.667 --> 11:24.767
Fine.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.600
(thunder)

11:26.667 --> 11:29.800
-When are you coming to bed?
-In a minute.

11:31.633 --> 11:35.200
-What are you doing?
-I am contouring my eyebrows.

11:35.834 --> 11:40.100
I use miss Christie Brinkley as a guide.
We have the same bone structure.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.834
I just hope she doesn't let herself go
to pot after that baby comes.

11:46.433 --> 11:49.433
Don't want her husband
coming after me.

11:55.533 --> 11:58.400
I never do much with my eyebrows.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.300
That's why from the nose up
you look like Wilford Brimley.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.166
Now don't say another word.
Just go to sleep.

12:06.033 --> 12:08.300
-Can I leave my light on?
-Yes.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.700
-I want you to know I appreciate this.
-Did I just say, "go to sleep"?

12:20.133 --> 12:22.133
I can't. I'm too scared.

12:22.767 --> 12:25.033
-Tell me a story.
-What?

12:25.100 --> 12:29.000
-Tell me a story.
-I don't know any.

12:29.066 --> 12:30.133
Make one up!

12:30.200 --> 12:33.200
All right. Once there were three bears--

12:33.266 --> 12:34.800
-Not that one.
-Pigs.

12:34.867 --> 12:36.233
-No!
-Elephants.

12:36.834 --> 12:38.533
They lived with a girl named Rose.

12:38.600 --> 12:42.200
-They lived in the house?
-They were elephant dolls.

12:44.367 --> 12:47.300
Every night when Rose went to bed,
she'd take the elephants.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.967
-They made her feel secure.
-Elephant dolls?

12:51.033 --> 12:56.233
Right. Until finally one night,
they got tired of Rose annoying them,

12:56.300 --> 12:58.233
they went someplace else,

12:58.300 --> 13:00.834
and two escaped convicts
snuck in through the window,

13:00.900 --> 13:04.166
-murdering Rose in her sleep.
-Oh!

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
Rose.

13:08.033 --> 13:10.700
Oh, Rose! Grow up!

13:21.300 --> 13:23.900
Mm, Sophia. That ziti was delicious.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.033
Please. Tell me something I don't know.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.300
Dorothy, you didn't even
taste my chipped beef.

13:29.367 --> 13:32.233
Of course I did, Rose.

13:33.433 --> 13:37.300
-You didn't like it.
-Oh, don't be ridiculous. I loved it.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.967
Well, then have another bite.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.233
Okay.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.734
(thunder)

13:52.800 --> 13:56.100
Oh, no.
The power lines must be down.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.166
(Sophia) That's just great.

13:57.233 --> 13:59.700
I got 10 pounds of fresh clams
in the refrigerator.

14:00.700 --> 14:01.700
Mm.

14:06.266 --> 14:09.000
Rose, that was delicious.
Oh, thank you.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.333
Who moved my purse?

14:15.934 --> 14:17.000
Hey.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.333
Why does it feel so heavy?

14:20.700 --> 14:25.767
Now... listen, you know,
we have these people coming to visit,

14:25.834 --> 14:29.200
and we haven't decided
on the sleeping arrangements.

14:29.266 --> 14:30.900
I'll sleep with Sophia.

14:30.967 --> 14:34.800
I should sleep with ma.
We've done it before.

14:34.867 --> 14:37.667
-We get along just fine.
-Except when you're sick.

14:37.734 --> 14:41.266
-Remember when you had bronchitis?
-I was really ill.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.867
Cool as a cucumber, thank God.

14:57.433 --> 15:01.066
-Ma, you woke me up.
-It's time for your medicine.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.133
I just took my medicine.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.967
You took it after dinner,
then you fell asleep.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.600
Read how much you should take.
I don't remember.

15:10.767 --> 15:14.033
-Two teaspoons every six hours.
-That's wrong.

15:14.100 --> 15:18.367
-It's written here!
-The pharmacist made a mistake.

15:18.433 --> 15:21.834
If he knew what he was doing,
he would be a doctor,

15:21.900 --> 15:23.367
instead of dressing like one.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.367
Give me a break. I'll take it later.

15:27.433 --> 15:31.767
-You're a lousy patient.
-What do you want? I'm sick!

15:32.266 --> 15:33.400
I don't know that?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.266
I've sat here for three nights
just to look at you?

15:38.633 --> 15:40.300
Believe me, you're no oil painting.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.400
I've been sitting here
because I thought you needed me.

15:44.900 --> 15:49.100
You needed me when you had the mumps,
the chicken pox, whooping cough...

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
rubella...

15:50.967 --> 15:52.700
or was Rubella our cleaning lady?

15:54.533 --> 15:58.333
It doesn't matter.
It hurts me to see my baby sick.

15:58.400 --> 16:02.000
But if I'm only being a nuisance,
I'll be happy to leave you alone.

16:02.066 --> 16:07.700
Oh, ma, wait. Ma, no, don't.
Ma, please.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.967
Come back here, ma.
I do need you.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.867
I'm sorry. I'm just cranky.

16:13.166 --> 16:16.834
You're right. I'm a lousy patient.
I always have been.

16:20.533 --> 16:25.667
I remember when I was a little girl and
used to get those terrible chest colds...

16:25.967 --> 16:27.367
and you'd whip up a batch

16:27.433 --> 16:30.700
of that homemade liniment
to rub on my chest.

16:31.266 --> 16:33.200
That was nasty stuff.

16:33.767 --> 16:38.700
Cod liver oil, garlic,
petroleum jelly, parsley.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.767
I remember once I asked you,
"Why parsley?"

16:42.000 --> 16:45.133
You said, "Presentation is very
important."

16:50.700 --> 16:52.834
Whenever I saw you
coming down the hall

16:52.900 --> 16:55.734
with that ceramic bowl
and a paintbrush...

16:56.133 --> 16:58.934
I'd run and hide under my bed and cry...

17:00.266 --> 17:03.200
then you'd rub some on my doll,
Mrs. Doolittle,

17:03.266 --> 17:04.867
to show me that it didn't hurt.

17:05.667 --> 17:09.333
And I'd come out from under the bed,
you'd put it on my chest...

17:10.567 --> 17:12.500
and the next day, I'd always feel better.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.066
Remember, ma?

17:33.300 --> 17:34.300
Good night, ma.

17:37.633 --> 17:38.967
Thanks for everything.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.934
I heard every word you said.

17:48.033 --> 17:51.667
I was just resting my eyes
so you'd leave me alone.

17:51.734 --> 17:55.533
With your father,
it only worked half the time.

17:57.033 --> 17:59.367
Asleep, awake, it didn't matter to him.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.600
Men are built that way.

18:05.400 --> 18:10.467
It's a fact. I saw Dr. Art Ulene explain
it on <i>The Today Show</i> with a plastic model.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.967
You slept like a baby.

18:15.033 --> 18:18.633
I know. I spent the whole night awake
in that chair.

18:18.700 --> 18:24.433
Couldn't be worse than sleeping on
a hard wooden bench in a railway station.

18:24.934 --> 18:27.266
Boy, you do it any place,
don't you, Blanche?

18:29.467 --> 18:33.400
Blanche is talking about coming back
from Edna McCarthy's funeral.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.000
Edna McCarthy is dead?

18:36.700 --> 18:40.734
Oh, my God! That's terrible.
I just sent her a chain letter.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.934
There's a dollar I'll never see.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.567
What a terrible night that was.

18:48.633 --> 18:52.467
We tried making a train connection
to return to Miami...

18:52.800 --> 18:55.700
Come on, girls, our next train comes
in 10 minutes.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.300
I don't think I can take another
three hours on a train.

18:58.367 --> 19:00.233
I'm looking forward to it.

19:00.767 --> 19:03.867
Then again, I've always loved trains.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.266
Oh, excuse me.

19:07.867 --> 19:10.734
What track does the 9:15
to Miami leave on?

19:11.233 --> 19:15.633
Well, ma'am, we've only got one track.
We call it track 19.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.500
Nobody knows why,
but it gives everybody

19:18.567 --> 19:21.033
something to talk about while they're
waiting on the next tornado

19:21.100 --> 19:22.367
to hit the mobile home.

19:26.934 --> 19:28.300
Thank you very much.

19:28.367 --> 19:31.900
Please say hello to Opie
and aunt Bea for me when you see them.

19:34.667 --> 19:38.433
Let's wait on the platform.
The train's coming soon.

19:38.500 --> 19:42.100
The 9:15 to Miami left at 8:45.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.500
How could our train have
left a half hour early?

19:46.767 --> 19:49.633
All the trains out of Appalapachobee
leave early.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.567
That's what our town's famous for!

19:52.033 --> 19:54.300
Y'all may think this sounds kind of
silly...

19:54.667 --> 19:59.934
but we actually printed "our trains leave
early" right on the town seal.

20:00.400 --> 20:05.200
Can your town seal play a song
on those little horns?

20:07.467 --> 20:09.867
No, but he'll balance
a ball on his nose

20:09.934 --> 20:11.567
if you throw him a catfish first.

20:13.300 --> 20:17.166
It's like <i>The Twilight Zone. </i>We're on a
train that ended up inside Rose's mind.

20:20.166 --> 20:22.834
When is the next train to Miami?

20:22.900 --> 20:26.667
We've got one scheduled to leave
at 6 am tomorrow.

20:26.734 --> 20:31.433
-So it actually leaves at 5:30?
-Welcome to Appalapachobee!

20:34.266 --> 20:38.900
I don't believe this! This has to be
the most depressing day of my life.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.934
First, Edna McCarthy's funeral, now this.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.266
Being at her funeral made me think
how quickly life can pass you by.

20:49.033 --> 20:53.100
-Maybe I ought to be more adventurous.
-More adventurous?

20:53.166 --> 20:56.734
The <i>Kama Sutra </i>had to publish
a supplement because of you.

20:57.233 --> 20:58.633
I don't mean men.

20:58.700 --> 21:02.500
I'm talking about things I've always
wanted to do, but never tried.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.800
You ever have something
you wanted to do?

21:05.867 --> 21:09.100
Some secret desire you kept
on the back burner?

21:09.834 --> 21:12.467
I always wanted to try a nudist camp.

21:12.934 --> 21:16.266
Some big pots belong
on the back burner.

21:24.266 --> 21:27.266
Uh, don't you have a cousin
you should be dating?

21:32.467 --> 21:33.934
(train whistle)

21:34.000 --> 21:36.934
You said there were
no trains until morning.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.200
-No more trains to Miami.
-That's the 9:20 to Sarasota.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.700
-Oh.
-Oh, well.

21:44.133 --> 21:47.734
-Maybe we should try and get some sleep.
-I won't be able to sleep.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.934
-I'm just too depressed.
-Me, too.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.033
This has been a terrible day.

21:58.133 --> 22:01.734
A friend's funeral,
stuck here in the middle of nowhere,

22:01.800 --> 22:03.867
trying to sleep on a hard wooden bench.

22:04.800 --> 22:08.600
I don't think I have
ever been this depressed.

22:23.233 --> 22:26.400
Rose, you really should remove some
of that make-up before you go to sleep.

22:27.734 --> 22:28.734
What?

22:30.500 --> 22:32.000
I don't believe it.

22:34.533 --> 22:39.400
-A circus! Where did they come from?
-The 9:20 to Sarasota's a circus train.

22:39.867 --> 22:42.467
Girls! This is a miracle.

22:43.467 --> 22:46.400
Our paths crossed here
so they could cheer us up.

22:48.867 --> 22:49.900
Excuse me.

22:50.166 --> 22:52.934
Mr. Clown, could you do something

22:53.000 --> 22:56.467
to put smiles on the faces
of three gloomy guses?

22:56.533 --> 22:59.333
Buzz off, lady.
I'm on a cigarette break.

23:08.233 --> 23:10.633
Oh, what a terrible night that was.

23:10.700 --> 23:14.033
Oh, wasn't so bad.
Something good did come out of it.

23:14.633 --> 23:17.633
I dated floppo the clown
for several months after that.

23:19.834 --> 23:22.266
You know, his feet really were that big...

23:25.233 --> 23:28.066
which, of course, as I'm sure you're
aware, means...

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
Uh...

23:32.834 --> 23:38.066
-ma, is there any more of that ziti?
-Nope. Cleaned me out.

23:38.133 --> 23:40.667
Let's call it a night.

23:40.734 --> 23:44.333
Wait, we haven't decided what to do
about cousin Milo and uncle Vito.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.367
I have an idea on that.
They're family, they'll understand.

23:47.433 --> 23:49.934
What do you say we all chip in
and put them up at the holiday inn?

23:50.000 --> 23:53.533
-Sounds good to me.
-Me, too. What do you think, ma?

23:54.033 --> 23:57.000
You know, in the right hands
and the right bag,

23:57.066 --> 23:59.400
this chipped beef isn't half bad.

24:08.567 --> 24:14.266
(theme music playing)
