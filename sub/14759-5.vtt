28:46.200 --> 28:48.167
-You all right?
-Mmm-hmm.

28:49.467 --> 28:52.733
Yeah, I reckon Sando's dog
needs to be put on a lead.

28:53.867 --> 28:55.167
He had a go at me.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.067
I reckon all the dogs in
Kettering need to be on leads.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.167
Something's rattling 'em.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.400
I'll have a word to Sando.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.500
Travis really liked her.

29:08.433 --> 29:09.567
Chloe.

29:10.633 --> 29:11.767
Oh yeah?

29:11.800 --> 29:14.167
He was pretty keen.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.967
He used to, like,
follow her and all.

29:16.067 --> 29:17.133
How do you mean?

29:17.167 --> 29:20.967
Kind of leave the office
whenever she walked by.

29:21.067 --> 29:23.733
You know, like text her
all the time and stuff.

29:23.767 --> 29:27.067
Did she like him?

29:27.533 --> 29:28.767
He's real old.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.500
All right, well,

29:30.533 --> 29:33.767
doesn't really prove anything,
but thanks.

29:33.800 --> 29:34.833
No.

29:34.867 --> 29:36.600
No, not saying it was...

29:41.767 --> 29:43.300
He kind of...

29:45.600 --> 29:47.067
He kind of raped me.

29:47.967 --> 29:49.067
Not really, like, rape.

29:49.067 --> 29:51.133
You know,
just a couple of times.

29:51.167 --> 29:52.967
What... What are you talking
about, Lize?

29:53.067 --> 29:54.467
When did this happen?

29:54.500 --> 29:56.200
It was a long time ago.

29:57.667 --> 30:00.133
But you know,
he gave me a job.

30:00.167 --> 30:03.367
There's not much work about,
so it worked out.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.533
Don't tell Dad, will you?
Please?

30:14.867 --> 30:16.367
I don't want it getting out.

30:17.633 --> 30:19.233
Dad'd kill him.

30:19.667 --> 30:21.033
And me.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.233
FERGUS: Uh, Lize?

30:28.600 --> 30:31.567
Eliza just told me
that Travis raped her.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.700
Bring him in.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.200
What do you think these are?

30:39.133 --> 30:41.133
Green night vision goggles.

30:41.167 --> 30:42.767
Army issue, probably.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.033
Put 'em on.

30:57.967 --> 30:59.133
What do you see?

30:59.633 --> 31:00.767
A green Dutch.

31:04.067 --> 31:05.333
Green office.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.567
Why? What's all this about?

31:12.333 --> 31:14.433
What are army goggles doing
at Mother Sullivan's Ridge?

31:26.700 --> 31:28.767
(GULLS CALLING)

31:59.600 --> 32:01.200
TRAVIS: Chloe Holloway?

32:02.067 --> 32:03.900
Who told you that?

32:03.933 --> 32:06.867
You were seen following Chloe
on a number of occasions.

32:06.900 --> 32:08.133
Why would I?

32:08.167 --> 32:09.367
Were you stalking her?

32:09.400 --> 32:11.067
If this is all coming from
Eliza Grayson,

32:11.067 --> 32:12.633
-I will fucking...
-What?

32:13.467 --> 32:14.500
What'll you do?

32:14.533 --> 32:17.333
Sack her,
'cause she's a lying bitch.

32:17.367 --> 32:19.767
It's her
you should be investigating.

32:21.067 --> 32:23.400
Look, I want to have a talk
to your boss.

32:24.767 --> 32:26.067
Don't have a boss.

32:27.167 --> 32:28.700
Yeah, you do.

32:29.633 --> 32:31.367
I just want a quick word.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.367
We can sort this thing out
in a minute.

32:36.233 --> 32:37.833
Or we'll sit here
for a couple of hours

32:37.867 --> 32:39.267
while I get my lawyer.

32:41.933 --> 32:43.233
Right.

32:51.167 --> 32:52.767
Wait there.

32:56.067 --> 32:57.367
Let me handle this.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.967
He might have a perfectly
logical explanation.

32:59.067 --> 33:01.400
Perhaps he was in the
boatshed with Dane.

33:20.167 --> 33:21.367
Did you do it?

33:22.800 --> 33:24.633
No, I bloody didn't.

33:26.267 --> 33:28.833
See, you've got nothing on me,

33:28.867 --> 33:31.900
but I've got a fucking
avalanche to bring down on you

33:31.933 --> 33:33.700
if this goes on
for one moment longer.

33:33.733 --> 33:34.767
Are you threatening me?

33:34.800 --> 33:36.267
You fucking bet I am.

33:37.267 --> 33:39.067
FERGUS: He's lying.

33:39.067 --> 33:41.900
He's covering for someone
or something.

33:41.933 --> 33:45.133
If Chloe was involved
or knew about the drugs...

33:45.167 --> 33:47.067
You gotta be 100% certain

33:47.067 --> 33:49.800
before you start
blowing whistles.

33:49.833 --> 33:53.067
I doubt if he's the one
that killed her,
and if he did,

33:53.067 --> 33:55.400
he'd hide it better.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.567
So why cover
for Dane Sullivan?

33:57.600 --> 34:00.233
And now Travis?

34:00.267 --> 34:02.200
And why would you bother lying
about a bloody cardigan?

34:02.233 --> 34:03.733

34:09.100 --> 34:12.167
FERGUS: He's now convinced
the murder took place
in Mother Sullivan's.

34:14.267 --> 34:16.767
Can't work out whether
he's trying to solve it

34:17.833 --> 34:19.467
or cover it up.

34:24.433 --> 34:25.600
Oh, you've gotta be
kidding me.

34:25.633 --> 34:28.167
DUTCH: No, it's okay.
Just a question.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.500
I'm not pointing the finger
at anyone,

34:30.533 --> 34:34.200
and this conversation
never happened, right?

34:34.233 --> 34:36.533
But do any of you blokes
know anything about

34:36.567 --> 34:38.600
Travis Kingston
and Grayson's daughter?

34:38.633 --> 34:39.767
Eliza?

34:40.933 --> 34:42.667
Just works for him.

34:42.700 --> 34:44.500
So no word of him, you know...

34:45.767 --> 34:47.400
Like using her,

34:47.433 --> 34:48.933
sexually, against her will?

34:48.967 --> 34:51.233
You're fucking kidding me.

34:51.267 --> 34:55.133
-He raped Eliza?
-Nah, maybe not.

34:55.167 --> 34:57.500
I'm just looking at all angles
on the murder.

34:57.533 --> 34:58.600
What, did he kill Chloe?

34:58.633 --> 35:00.533
No, he appears
to have an alibi,

35:00.567 --> 35:03.200
and that's all you need
to get off a charge
these days.

35:04.233 --> 35:06.267
Sometimes I wish
I wasn't a bloody cop.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.533
Oh, well.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.600
Have a good day, guys.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.367
Why did you leave
Gillian Baxter

36:11.400 --> 36:13.533
in the forest that night?

36:13.567 --> 36:15.067
Beg your pardon?

36:15.067 --> 36:17.100
Because that's what
everyone wants to know.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.667
Why?

36:22.633 --> 36:23.633
I was upset.

36:24.267 --> 36:25.400
About?

36:27.167 --> 36:29.500
I was only gonna leave her
there for an hour.

What?

36:45.567 --> 36:48.167

are fucking dead!

-I didn't fucking do it!
-Hold him.

36:53.267 --> 36:56.300
-Come on!
-I swear on my mum's grave!

How's our town publican?

37:45.133 --> 37:48.067
You ready for your big
send-off?

37:48.067 --> 37:51.067
Feel like a bit of a wake,
does it?

37:53.267 --> 37:55.133
ROY: How can I help you?

37:55.167 --> 37:56.600
I was wondering
what you can tell me

37:56.633 --> 37:58.500
about Gillian Baxter's father.

37:58.533 --> 38:02.133
Why don't you ask Renae?
That's her business.

38:02.167 --> 38:04.800
I reckon it's your
business, too, Roy.

38:04.833 --> 38:06.833
You see, I've been doing
some thinking.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.067
I keep wondering
about your decision

38:08.100 --> 38:11.067
to send Anna away
all that time ago.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.900
You weren't even here, Dutch.

38:13.933 --> 38:15.400
Why are you bringing
that up now?

38:15.433 --> 38:17.700
Because another girl
went missing recently.

38:18.433 --> 38:19.800
In fact,

38:19.833 --> 38:23.100
she went missing the same day
your daughter came home.

38:23.133 --> 38:25.133
The very day.

38:25.167 --> 38:27.333
And it made me wonder

38:27.367 --> 38:30.067
why a sweet little girl
might kill another.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.100
I think jealousy might be
the answer.

38:34.100 --> 38:37.067
Girls don't like sharing
their fathers.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.067
You don't know
what you're talking about.

38:41.100 --> 38:43.200
This town worships you, Roy.

38:43.233 --> 38:45.600

considerable pain.

About 10 days.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.333
You were in a terrible state.

41:40.367 --> 41:43.233
You were having
these episodes,

41:43.267 --> 41:46.067
and they were just checking
that you were not...

41:49.800 --> 41:51.667
Why can't I remember
any of this?

41:51.700 --> 41:53.900
Because I told you.

41:53.933 --> 41:55.067
You were in the
hospital for...

Pneumonia.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.167
And the drugs they were
giving me...

41:59.200 --> 42:02.133
Were to sedate you.

42:02.167 --> 42:03.700
And they worked
and they let you out.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.400
He saved me.

42:22.433 --> 42:24.533
And you threw him in prison.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.467
Why, Dad?

42:28.067 --> 42:29.400
Why did you lie?

42:29.433 --> 42:32.533
You said you saw a man in
an orange van in the forest.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.367
He used to stalk you
and Gillian.

42:40.400 --> 42:44.067
You've put words in my mouth
I couldn't possibly have said.

42:44.100 --> 42:47.333
There's not a word of truth
in here, is there?

42:47.367 --> 42:50.333
And yet you ignored
other witnesses.

42:50.367 --> 42:51.833
-Why?
-Because you ran out

with her for over eight hours!

42:59.900 --> 43:01.067

43:01.067 --> 43:02.200

I realised it wasn't
your blood.

I was trying to protect you.

43:20.067 --> 43:21.400
You must know that.

to cover for me.

You think I killed Gillian?

43:44.100 --> 43:46.100
I wasn't gonna lose
both of you!

43:59.600 --> 44:01.667
You better get
to your celebration, Dad.

44:09.633 --> 44:11.367
(MUSIC PLAYING)

44:21.867 --> 44:23.233
DEB: Where is he?

44:26.800 --> 44:28.067
Where's the guest of honour?

44:28.067 --> 44:29.767
I'm sure he's on his way.

44:38.533 --> 44:39.767
I've nailed him.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.167
He's running drugs.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.700
Now, the Assistant
Commissioner's
gonna be there tonight.

44:47.733 --> 44:49.933
I'm gonna talk to him
privately, after the event.

44:49.967 --> 44:51.167
No.

44:51.933 --> 44:53.367
You won't.

44:55.267 --> 44:57.233
You haven't got enough on him.

44:57.267 --> 44:58.933
He's still a fellow cop.

44:58.967 --> 45:00.367
And that's supposed to mean
something?

45:01.067 --> 45:02.200
Is it?

45:03.933 --> 45:05.567
What's going on here, Roy?

45:12.067 --> 45:13.800
What am I missing?

45:13.833 --> 45:15.267
Or more to the point...

45:16.233 --> 45:17.667
What's Dutch got on you?

45:25.467 --> 45:28.367
(MUSIC PLAYING)

45:31.067 --> 45:35.100
-(ALL CHEERING)

45:38.500 --> 45:40.367
CRAIG: (OVER MICROPHONE)
Thanks, girls, well done.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.767
Ladies and gents,
if you'd like to just

45:41.800 --> 45:44.633
top up your drinks,
we'll be back in a minute.

45:51.700 --> 45:53.467
Hey, mate.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.800
Where've you been?

45:58.067 --> 46:00.133
I didn't expect you to come.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.200
We need to talk to you.

46:03.233 --> 46:04.167
Later.

46:04.200 --> 46:06.067
Let's get this
out of the way first.

46:14.067 --> 46:17.233
Alrighty, a bit of shoosh,
thanks, folks.

46:17.267 --> 46:19.467
Uh, we all know why
we're gathered here tonight.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.400
Uh, we're here
to pay tribute to

46:21.433 --> 46:24.067
one of the district's finest,

46:24.100 --> 46:26.333
Roy Macy.

46:31.067 --> 46:35.067
And first up we have
Deb Russell to say
a few words.

46:38.367 --> 46:40.533
(DEB SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
OVER MICROPHONE
IN DISTANCE)

46:51.567 --> 46:53.633
What are you doing here?

46:53.667 --> 46:55.600
I could ask you
the same question.

47:03.233 --> 47:04.933
(CROWD APPLAUDING DISTANTLY)

47:04.967 --> 47:06.167
What are they?

47:09.767 --> 47:11.700
(SIGHING) Um...

47:11.733 --> 47:14.367
Just an old pair of goggles
I found up at the ridge.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.200
What were you doing up there?

47:16.233 --> 47:18.200
Looking for a crime scene.

47:20.767 --> 47:22.800
(EERIE SOUNDS)

47:29.867 --> 47:31.433
What's wrong?

47:31.467 --> 47:33.300
Nothing.

47:33.333 --> 47:35.400
You think that's where Chloe
was killed?

47:36.500 --> 47:37.633
Maybe.

47:43.667 --> 47:45.133
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

47:47.567 --> 47:51.900
No weapon, no vehicle,
no crime scene.

47:51.933 --> 47:53.200
Just this

47:55.233 --> 47:57.333
little crimson flower
to go on.

47:58.467 --> 48:01.067
It clones itself,
according to Fergus.

48:02.067 --> 48:03.667
ANNA:
You should speak to Jens.

48:03.700 --> 48:06.433
He was telling me
about a flower like this.

48:07.633 --> 48:10.367
So why aren't you
at your father's celebration?

48:16.867 --> 48:18.800
I'd say the same reason
as you.

48:34.733 --> 48:37.667
Next person I'd like to
welcome up onto the stage

48:37.700 --> 48:40.167
is our very special guest
for the night,

48:40.200 --> 48:42.333
and that is none other

48:42.367 --> 48:44.800
than the Assistant
Commissioner for Police,

48:44.833 --> 48:46.100
Mr Brendan Trengrove.

48:51.367 --> 48:53.067
BRENDAN: Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

48:53.067 --> 48:56.233
You know, the Force
really needs your average cop.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.933
The sort of cop
that's entwined

48:57.967 --> 48:59.900
in the life of the community.

49:00.067 --> 49:02.700
Men and women in the Force
who make themselves integral

49:02.733 --> 49:05.733
to the lives of the people
in their district.

49:05.767 --> 49:08.367
That not only enforce
the laws of the land,

49:08.400 --> 49:10.933
but involve themselves
with the local footy team,

49:10.967 --> 49:12.733
fight the fires,

49:12.767 --> 49:15.567
drive the tractor at fetes.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.433
To be a country cop
you need to be a friend,

49:18.467 --> 49:23.067
a confidante and a counsellor,
a mentor.

49:23.067 --> 49:25.467
Everyone depends on you.

49:25.500 --> 49:29.167
And that decent, honest cop
is the man standing here,

49:30.567 --> 49:35.633
Sergeant, or should I say,
former Sergeant Roy Macy.

49:35.667 --> 49:38.300
You not only have
the Force's thanks, mate,

49:38.333 --> 49:40.233
you have the thanks
of your town.

DR SUTTON: (OVER PHONE)
Dr Macy?

50:23.000 --> 50:24.800
It's Dr Polly Sutton here.

50:24.833 --> 50:26.233
Yes?

50:26.267 --> 50:27.933
I'm calling about a blood
sample you dropped off

50:27.967 --> 50:30.000
for your patient, Kade Fisher.

50:32.067 --> 50:34.200
This blood has more
anisocytoses

50:34.233 --> 50:35.967
than I've ever seen before,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.733
with hugely variable
cell morphology.

50:39.267 --> 50:40.900
It...

50:40.933 --> 50:43.633
It does not appear to be
human blood.

50:45.900 --> 50:47.200
Hello?

50:48.000 --> 50:49.767
Are you there, Dr Macy?

50:50.800 --> 50:52.300
Dr Macy?
